## Overview

This is an academic research project from Stanford University (SALT-NLP) that introduces real-time reasoning as a new problem formulation for bringing reasoning capabilities to agents operating in evolving environments.

## Key Concepts

- **Real-Time Reasoning**: Making logical AND timely judgments in dynamic environments where hazards emerge, opportunities arise, and other agents act - all while the agent's own reasoning is still unfolding.

- **Real-Time Reasoning Gym**: A platform with three game environments (Freeway, Snake, Overcooked) to evaluate and advance real-time reasoning capabilities of language agents.

- **AgileThinker**: A parallel architecture that simultaneously engages both System 1 (fast, intuitive) and System 2 (slow, deliberate) reasoning paradigms. Demonstrates superior performance as task difficulty and time pressure increase.

## Research Team

- Yule Wen (Tsinghua University) - Co-leading author
- Yixin Ye (Shanghai Jiao Tong University) - Co-leading author

## Agent Architectures

### Reactive Agent (System 1)
Fast, intuitive reasoning with bounded computation. Ensures timeliness but sacrifices decision quality under high cognitive load.

### Planning Agent (System 2)
Slow, deliberate reasoning with unbounded computation. Improves decision quality but struggles under time pressure.

### AgileThinker (Parallel System 1 + System 2)
Runs both reactive and planning systems in parallel. Streaming output from planning system immediately enhances reactive system's fast decisions. Achieves robust performance across different levels of cognitive load and time pressure.

## Game Environments

1. **Freeway**: Tests reaction to emergent hazards (traffic navigation)
2. **Snake**: Tests taking emergent opportunities (food collection while avoiding obstacles)
3. **Overcooked**: Tests collaboration with dynamic partners (cooperative cooking)

## Installation & Usage

```bash
git clone git@github.com:SALT-NLP/RealtimeGym.git
cd RealtimeGym
pip install -e .
```

```python
import realtimegym
from realtimegym.agents.agile import AgileThinker
from realtimegym.prompts import freeway as prompt

env, seed, _ = realtimegym.make_env("Freeway-v0")
obs, done = env.reset()

agent = AgileThinker(prompt, "freeway_v0_agile.csv", 'token')

while not done:
    agent.observe(obs)      # Fast observation
    agent.think(timeout=4096)  # Bounded thinking (token or seconds)
    action = agent.act()
    obs, done, reward, reset = env.step(action)
```

## Key Findings

Experiments show that under cognitive load and time pressure, AgileThinker greatly outperforms agents engaging only one LLM with either System 1 or System 2 reasoning. The parallel architecture manages the trade-off between reasoning depth and response latency.
