## Overview

This is an academic research project from Stanford University (SALT-NLP) and SAP that introduces CooperBench, the first benchmark designed to measure how well AI agents can cooperate when handling individual tasks with potential conflicts.

## Key Concepts

- **CooperBench**: A benchmark comprising 652 tasks constructed from 12 popular open-source libraries across Python, TypeScript, Go, and Rust.

- **The Curse of Coordination**: GPT-5 and Claude Sonnet 4.5 based agents achieve only 25% success with two-agent cooperation, around 50% lower than a "Solo" baseline using one agent to implement both features.

- **Coordination Failures**: Communication channels become jammed with vague, ill-timed, and inaccurate messages. Agents deviate from commitments and hold incorrect expectations about their partner's plans.

## Research Team

- Arpandeep Khatua (Stanford University) - Co-leading author
- Hao Zhu (Stanford University) - Co-leading author
- Peter Tran (SAP, Inc.)
- Arya Prabhudesai (SAP, Inc.)
- Frederic Sadrieh (SAP, Inc.)
- Johann K. Lieberwirth (SAP, Inc.)
- Xinkai Yu (Stanford University)
- Yicheng Fu (Stanford University)
- Michael J. Ryan (Stanford University)
- Jiaxin Pei (Stanford University)
- Diyi Yang (Stanford University)

## Research Questions

1. **RQ1**: How well can agents cooperate with each other?
2. **RQ2**: What role does communication play in agent-agent cooperation?
3. **RQ3**: What coordination failures do agents exhibit?

## Key Findings

- Communication channels become jammed with vague, ill-timed, and inaccurate messages
- Agents fail to respond to direct questions, send messages that arrive too late
- Even with effective communication, agents deviate from their commitments
- Agents hold incorrect expectations about their partner's plans

## Emergent Coordination Behaviors

Through large-scale simulation, we uncover three major categories of successful coordination:
1. Role division
2. Resource division
3. Negotiations
