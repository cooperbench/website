                            We built a benchmark to test whether AI coding agents can work together. They can't. When two agents split a workload that one agent handles fine alone, success rates drop by half. The problem isn't that they lack skill. It's that they lack the ability to coordinate.

                        Imagine you're pair programming with a colleague. Now imagine they don't follow the plan, ignore half your questions, and sometimes just lie about what they've done. That's what it's like when AI agents try to work together.
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                        Most achievements in modern civilization arise from individuals working cooperatively. From the construction of cathedrals to the development of open-source software, human teams consistently outperform individuals on complex tasks. As AI agents become more capable, we naturally expect these abilities to translate to effective teamwork.
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                        We tested this assumption. We ran 652 tasks where two agents split the same workload that one agent handles fine. Success rates dropped by half.
                    </p>

                    <!-- Section: The Setup -->
                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-14 mb-6">The setup</h2>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                        In human teams, adding teammates should improve productivity. A software engineer working alone might complete two features in a week. Two engineers should complete those same features faster, or with higher quality, or both.
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                        We wanted to know if AI agents follow the same pattern. So we built a benchmark called CooperBench. We took 12 popular open-source libraries and created tasks where two agents each build a different feature. The features are compatible. They can be merged. But they touch the same files. If the agents don't coordinate, their code will conflict.
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-8">
                        This is how real software development works. Two engineers on the same repo need to stay in sync, or their pull requests will clash.

                        We tested five leading models on CooperBench, including GPT-5, Claude Sonnet 4.5, and MiniMax M2. The results were consistent across all of them.
                    </p>

                    <div class="mb-8 not-prose py-5 px-6 bg-red-50 rounded-xl">

                        This held across easy, medium, and hard tasks. We call it the <em>curse of coordination</em>. Two agents working together perform worse than one agent doing both tasks alone.

                        The gap is largest for tasks of medium difficulty. When tasks are trivially easy, agents can spare effort for coordination. When tasks are impossibly hard, coordination problems are overshadowed by technical challenges. But in the middle, where most real work happens, the coordination overhead becomes the limiting factor.
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-8">
                        We also tried scaling to more agents. Performance kept dropping. With 2 agents we saw 68.6% success. With 3 it fell to 46.5%. With 4 it dropped to 30.0%. More agents, more coordination overhead, more opportunities for failure.

                    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                        Our agents have access to a communication tool that allows them to send natural language messages to each other in real time. If the curse of coordination stems from a lack of communication, then agents that communicate more should perform better. Right?
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                        We compared performance with and without the communication tool. Communication does reduce merge conflicts. When agents can talk, they produce patches that are more structurally compatible. They learn about each other's plans and adjust.
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                        But communication does not improve overall success. Despite fewer merge conflicts, the final merged code does not pass more tests.

                        In all these cases, agents can't see each other's work. Each agent is guessing what its partner is doing. A merge can look clean and still be broken.

                        There's a tension here. Models are trained to be cautious, to want observable evidence, to resist unverifiable claims. That makes sense when users might try to mislead them. But collaboration requires trust. When Agent A says "I added the handler at line 50", Agent B can't verify it because they're on separate branches. Agents are trained to verify, but collaboration requires them to trust. This mismatch may explain why they fail to update their picture of what their partner is doing, even when told directly.

                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-14 mb-6">Where this leaves us</h2>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                        If you're hoping to deploy multiple AI agents on the same project, our results are sobering. Right now, you're better off with one agent doing everything than two agents splitting the work. The coordination overhead eats the gains.
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                        Industry labs have found workarounds. Cursor recently <a href="https://cursor.com/blog/scaling-agents" class="text-primary hover:underline">reported</a> running hundreds of concurrent agents on a single project by separating them into planners and workers with explicit role hierarchies. Our findings help explain why such scaffolding is necessary. Without it, agents struggle to coordinate even on simple two-agent tasks.
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                        But scaffolding is a workaround, not a solution. It places the coordination burden on human developers who must design the right structures. And it limits flexibility. Agent teams can't adapt to novel situations where the right division of work isn't obvious at the start.
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                        This matters beyond software. The same coordination failures will appear anywhere we deploy multiple agents together. Scientific research, business operations, creative projects. If agents can't coordinate on a codebase where success is clearly defined by passing tests, they'll struggle even more in domains where success is ambiguous.
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                        But this isn't permanent. In our successful traces, we saw agents figure out coordination on their own. They divided roles, partitioned files, negotiated approaches. The capability is there. It's just not reliable yet.
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                        And that's what makes us hopeful. These emergent coordination behaviors give us something to work with. CooperBench captures hundreds of examples where agents succeed and fail at working together. That's a training signal. Future models could be post-trained on these traces, learning what good coordination looks like.
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                        Even better, CooperBench isn't just a dataset. It's a live environment. You can drop models in, pair them up, and let them learn to work together through trial and error. The same tasks that expose failures today can be the training ground that fixes them.
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-8">
                        The bottleneck for multi-agent systems isn't raw ability. It's social intelligence. But social intelligence can be taught. And now we have a place to teach it.
