                        Most achievements in modern civilization arise from individuals working cooperatively. From the construction of cathedrals to the development of open-source software, human teams consistently outperform individuals on complex tasks. As we deploy AI agents in collaborative settings, we naturally expect that strong individual capabilities will translate to effective coordination.
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                        We tested this assumption.

                            When we assigned two agents the same workload a single agent could handle, success rates dropped by half. Adding a teammate made agents worse, not better.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <!-- Section: The Question -->
                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-14 mb-6">The question we set out to answer</h2>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                        In human teams, we expect that adding teammates will improve productivity. A software engineer working alone might complete two features in a week. Two engineers working together should complete those same features faster, or with higher quality, or both. This is the bottom line for cooperation to be considered functional.
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                        But what about AI agents? When you deploy two coding agents to work on related features, do they coordinate effectively? Or do they step on each other's toes, duplicate work, and produce incompatible solutions?
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                        To answer this, we built CooperBench. We constructed 652 tasks from 12 popular open-source libraries across Python, TypeScript, Go, and Rust. Eight co-authors with real-world software engineering backgrounds created new features, unit tests, and ground-truth code for these libraries. Each task assigns two agents different features that can be implemented independently but may conflict without proper coordination.
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-8">
                        The features are logically compatible. They can be merged into the same codebase. But they touch overlapping files and functions. Without understanding each other's goals, plans, and expectations, the agents' solutions may introduce incompatible changes. This mirrors real-world software development where coordination failures stem from insufficient mutual understanding.
                    </p>

                    <!-- Section: The Curse of Coordination -->
                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-14 mb-6">The curse of coordination</h2>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                        We evaluated five state-of-the-art models on CooperBench, including GPT-5, Claude Sonnet 4.5, and MiniMax M2. The results were consistent across all of them.
                    </p>

                    <div class="border border-red-200 rounded-xl p-6 mb-8 bg-red-50 not-prose">

                            <strong>GPT-5 and Claude Sonnet 4.5</strong> based agents achieve only <strong>25% success rate</strong> with two-agent cooperation on CooperBench. This is around <strong>50% lower</strong> than a "Solo" baseline where one agent implements both features.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                        This pattern held across the full spectrum of task difficulties. We call this the <em>curse of coordination</em>. When two agents need to coordinate, they perform worse than one agent doing both tasks alone.

                        The gap is largest for tasks of medium difficulty. When tasks are trivially easy, agents can spare effort for coordination. When tasks are impossibly hard, coordination problems are overshadowed by technical challenges. But in the middle, where most real work happens, the coordination overhead becomes the limiting factor.
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-8">
                        We also ran experiments scaling the number of agents from 2 to 4. Performance dropped monotonically. With 2 agents we saw 68.6% success. With 3 agents it fell to 46.5%. With 4 agents it dropped to 30.0%. More agents means more coordination overhead and more opportunities for failure.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-14 mb-6">What is jamming the communication channel</h2>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                        Our agents have access to a communication tool that allows them to send natural language messages to each other in real time. If the curse of coordination stems from a lack of communication, then agents that communicate more should perform better. Right?
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                        We compared performance with and without the communication tool. The results were striking.
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                        Communication does reduce merge conflicts. When agents can talk to each other, they produce patches that are more structurally compatible. This makes intuitive sense. Agents learn about each other's plans and adjust accordingly.
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                        But communication does not improve overall success. Despite fewer merge conflicts, the final merged code does not pass more tests. The difference between "with communication" and "without communication" settings is not statistically significant.

                        This reveals something important. Agents lack the critical <em>pragmatics</em> understanding of language. Communication is not just about message passing. It is about achieving certain functions through passing those messages. Agents are "talking" a lot, but they cannot achieve their communication goals when the channel is jammed with repetitions, unresponded questions, and false information.

                        The common thread across these failures is <em>partial observability</em>. Each agent acts while holding an uncertain model of its partner's state, edits, and commitments. A merge can be conflict-free yet still embed incompatible assumptions.

                    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                        We hypothesize that a deeper tension underlies expectation failures. Models are trained to be cautious, requiring observable evidence and resisting unverifiable assertions. This is a sensible default for single-agent interactions, where users may attempt to mislead the model.
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-8">
                        But collaboration under workspace isolation requires the opposite. Agents must trust partner claims about states they cannot observe. When Agent A reports "I added the handler at line 50", Agent B's instinct is to verify. But verification fails because they are on separate branches. This mismatch between <em>verification-first</em> training and <em>trust-requiring</em> collaboration may partly explain why agents consistently fail to update their model of partner state despite explicit communication.

                    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                        Recent work from industry labs has shown that multi-agent systems can produce impressive results. Cursor recently <a href="https://cursor.com/blog/scaling-agents" class="text-primary hover:underline">reported</a> running hundreds of concurrent agents on a single project, coordinating their work across millions of lines of code. They found that separating agents into planners and workers, with explicit role hierarchies, helped avoid the coordination problems we observe.
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                        Our findings help explain why such scaffolding is necessary. Without explicit structure, agents struggle to coordinate even on simple two-agent tasks. The emergent role division and resource division we observe in successful traces is exactly what hierarchical systems like Cursor's enforce by design.
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                        But scaffolding is not a solution. It is a workaround. It places the coordination burden on human developers who must design the right structures. And it limits the flexibility of agent teams, preventing them from adapting to novel situations where the right division of work is not obvious at the start.
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                        Our work suggests that the field needs a shift. Individual capability is not enough. We need agents with <em>social intelligence</em>. The ability to understand others, communicate effectively, and coordinate actions.

                            Prompt optimization yields only marginal improvements. Most errors stem from coordination challenges, not prompt wording. The capability gaps we identify require deeper changes. Training objectives that reward coordination under partial observability. Lightweight protocols for verifiable commitments. Richer communication channels such as screen sharing to expand bandwidth beyond text.

                        In a future where agents team with humans in high-stakes domains, accelerate science and technology research, and empower creative endeavors, it is hard to imagine how an agent incapable of coordination would contribute. However strong their individual capabilities.

                        Our work demonstrates that coordination, not raw coding ability, is a central bottleneck for multi-agent software development. But coordination is not beyond reach. In successful traces, we see what coordination could look like. The capability exists. Making it reliable is the challenge.

Only by developing social intelligence beyond individual capabilities can we build AI agents that become reliable teammates.
