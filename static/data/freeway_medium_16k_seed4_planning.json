The action taken at turn T will move the player to the next y at the next turn (T+1). So at turn T, the player is at y_T, and we check the car on freeway y_T at turn T.\n\nWe can only move up (U), down (D), or stay (S). We start at y=0 and wish to reach y=9.\n\nWe must avoid collisions on freeways 1 to 8. Note that y=0 and y=9 are safe (no cars).\n\nThe cars on each freeway are given at turn t1 (which is 0). We need to compute the car spans at future turns.\n\nWe note the car update:\n\nFor a car at turn t1 (current turn) with head h and tail tau, and direction d, and speed s:\n\n- If left-moving: then at turn T (>= t1), the span becomes [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)].\n  But note: the example given for left-moving is written as: \n      Span(t1) = [h, tau] -> Span(T) = [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\n  However, note that in the example for left-moving, the head is the rightmost? Actually, the problem states:\n      Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, tau] -> ... \n      Right-moving: Span(t1) = [tau, h] -> ...\n\nBut looking at the provided cars, all are right-moving? Because the direction is \"right\". So for right-moving cars:\n\n  At turn t1: the span is [tau, h] (meaning from tau to h, and since it's moving right, tau is the leftmost and h the rightmost? Actually, the update rule for right-moving: \n      Span(T) = [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut note the example: \n    \"Right-moving: [Span(t1) = [tau, h] -> Span(T) = [tau + s (T-t1), h + s (T-t1)]\"\n\nSo for a right-moving car, at turn t1, the car occupies the interval [tau, h] (with tau <= h). Then at turn T, it moves to [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if the player is on freeway k (so y_T = k) and 0 is in the span of any car on freeway k at turn T.\n\nImportant: The player moves at the same time as the cars. So at each turn, the player's position is updated and the cars move.\n\nWe start at turn t1=0 at (0,0). We wish to reach (0,9). We must plan a sequence of actions (each being U, D, or S) that minimizes the number of turns H.\n\nWe note that the minimal H without any cars would be 9 (if we always go up). But we have to avoid the cars.\n\nWe must check for each freeway k (from 1 to 8) and for each turn T when the player is at y_T = k, that 0 is not in the span of any car on freeway k at turn T.\n\nGiven the car state at turn 0:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (-48, -59, right, 3) -> but note: for a right-moving car, the span at turn0 is [tau, h] = [-59, -48]? \n  Actually, the problem states: for right-moving, the span at t1 is [tau, h]. But the data is given as (head, tail, direction, speed). \n\nLet me reinterpret: the problem says for a car: (head h, tail tau, direction d, speed s). \n\nBut for right-moving, the head is the front (rightmost) and tail is the back (leftmost). So at turn0, the car on freeway1 is a right-moving car with tail=-59, head=-48? \n\nBut the problem says for right-moving: Span(t1)=[tau, h]. So the car on freeway1 at turn0: tau=-59, h=-48. So the span is [-59, -48]. \n\nThen at turn T, the span becomes: [tau + s*T, h + s*T] = [-59 + 3*T, -48 + 3*T].\n\nWe are concerned about when the car covers 0? That is when -59+3T <= 0 <= -48+3T? \n\nBut note: the interval is [a, b] meaning a to b inclusive? Actually, the problem says \"span\", and we assume it's a contiguous interval. So we require:\n\n   -59 + 3T <= 0 <= -48 + 3T   ?\n\nBut let's solve:\n\nFirst inequality: -59 + 3T <= 0  => 3T <= 59 => T <= 59/3 ≈ 19.666 -> T <= 19 for the left bound.\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= -48 + 3T => 3T >= 48 => T >= 16.\n\nSo for T in [16,19] (since T is integer) -> T=16,17,18,19: the car covers 0 on freeway1.\n\nSimilarly, for the other freeways.\n\nBut note: freeway 2,3,4,5 each have a car: (48,37,right,12). Wait, that seems odd because 48>37, but for a right-moving car, the head should be greater than the tail? But here head=48, tail=37 -> so the span at turn0 is [37,48]. Then at turn T: [37+12T, 48+12T]. \n\nWhen does this cover 0? \n  37+12T <= 0 <= 48+12T -> \n  First: 37+12T<=0 -> 12T<=-37 -> T<= -37/12 -> negative, so never. \n  Second: 0<=48+12T -> always true for T>=0? But the first condition fails. So actually, this car never covers 0? Because the entire car is at positive positions and moving right, so it will never be at 0.\n\nBut wait, let me check: the car is at [37,48] at T=0, then at T=1: [49,60], ... so indeed never 0.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6: two cars: \n   (48,37,right,12) -> same as above, never at 0.\n   (0,-11,right,12) -> at turn0: span = [-11,0]? Because tail=-11, head=0? \n        Then at turn T: [-11+12T, 0+12T] = [12T-11, 12T]\n        This car covers 0 when: 12T-11 <= 0 <= 12T -> \n        First: 12T-11<=0 -> T<=11/12 -> T=0 only? (since T>=0 integer)\n        Second: 0<=12T -> always true for T>=0.\n        So at T=0: 12*0-11 = -11 <=0<=0? -> 0 is in [-11,0]? Yes, at T=0, the car covers 0.\n\nSo on freeway6 at turn0, there is a car that covers 0. \n\nBut note: we start at turn0 at y0=0 (which is not freeway1-8, so no collision) and we are going to move. However, if we were to be at freeway6 at turn0, we would collide. But we are at y=0 at turn0.\n\nFreeway7: two cars:\n   (-48,-59,right,6): at turn0: [-59, -48] -> at turn T: [-59+6T, -48+6T]\n        Covers 0 when: -59+6T<=0<=-48+6T -> \n        First: -59+6T<=0 -> T<=59/6≈9.83 -> T<=9\n        Second: 0<=-48+6T -> 6T>=48 -> T>=8\n        So T=8,9: the car covers 0.\n\n   (0,-11,right,6): at turn0: [-11,0] -> at turn T: [6T-11, 6T]\n        Covers 0 when: 6T-11<=0<=6T -> \n        First: 6T<=11 -> T<=11/6≈1.83 -> T=0,1\n        Second: 0<=6T -> always for T>=0.\n        So at T=0 and T=1, the car covers 0.\n\nFreeway8: same as freeway7? \n   (-48,-59,right,6) -> same as above: covers 0 at T=8,9.\n   (0,-11,right,6) -> same: covers 0 at T=0,1.\n\nNow, we must avoid:\n\nFreeway1: T in [16,19] -> so if we are at freeway1 at turns 16,17,18,19 -> collision.\n\nFreeway6: \n   The first car (48,37,12) never at 0.\n   The second car (0,-11,12): only at T=0. So if we are at freeway6 at turn0, we collide.\n\nFreeway7: \n   First car: at T=8,9 -> avoid freeway7 at turns 8 and 9.\n   Second car: at T=0,1 -> avoid freeway7 at turns 0 and 1.\n\nFreeway8: same as freeway7: avoid at T=0,1 and T=8,9.\n\nFreeways 2,3,4,5: no car ever covers 0? So we can be there at any time.\n\nBut note: freeway6 has the second car that covers 0 only at T=0. So if we are at freeway6 at any other time, we are safe? \n\nBut wait: the car (0,-11,12) at turn0: [ -11, 0 ] -> at turn1: [ -11+12, 0+12] = [1,12] -> doesn't cover 0? So only at turn0.\n\nSo freeway6 is safe at all turns except turn0.\n\nSimilarly, freeway7: \n   The second car: (0,-11,6) -> at turn0: [-11,0] -> covers 0 at turn0 and turn1? \n        At turn0: [-11,0] -> 0 is in it? yes.\n        At turn1: [ -11+6, 0+6] = [-5,6] -> does it cover 0? yes, because -5<=0<=6.\n        At turn2: [1,12] -> doesn't cover 0.\n\n   So actually, the second car on freeway7 and freeway8 covers 0 at turn0 and turn1? \n\n   Correction: at turn1: the car moves to [-5,6] -> which includes 0. So we must avoid freeway7 at turn0 and turn1? \n\n   But the problem says: at turn T, the car's span at turn T is [tau + s*T, h + s*T]. \n        For freeway7 second car: at T=0: [-11,0] -> includes 0? yes.\n        at T=1: [-11+6*1, 0+6*1] = [-5,6] -> includes 0? yes.\n        at T=2: [1,12] -> does not.\n\n   Therefore, we must avoid freeway7 at T=0 and T=1? But note: the player is at freeway7 at turn T meaning that at the beginning of turn T, the player is at freeway7, and then we check the car at the same turn T.\n\n   So if we are at freeway7 at turn0 or turn1, we collide.\n\n   Similarly, freeway8: same.\n\nAlso, freeway7 first car: at T=8: [-59+6*8, -48+6*8] = [-59+48, -48+48] = [-11,0] -> includes 0? yes.\n           T=9: [-59+54, -48+54] = [-5,6] -> includes 0? yes.\n           T=10: [1,12] -> no.\n\nSo freeway7: avoid at T=0,1 (from the second car) and T=8,9 (from the first car).\n\nSimilarly, freeway8: same.\n\nNow, freeway6: only at turn0 we have the second car that covers 0? But we start at turn0 at y=0, so we are not on freeway6 at turn0. But if we move to freeway6 at turn1? \n\nAt turn1: the car on freeway6 for the second car: at T=1: [-11+12, 0+12] = [1,12] -> doesn't cover 0. So freeway6 is safe at turn1 and beyond.\n\nBut note: the first car on freeway6 (48,37,12) is never at 0.\n\nSo freeway6 is safe for any turn T>=1.\n\nOur goal: reach y=9 in minimal turns.\n\nWe start at y0=0 (turn0). We can move U, D, or S.\n\nConstraints:\n\n- We cannot be on freeway7 or freeway8 at turns 0 or 1 (because we are at y=0 at turn0, we are safe, but if we go to freeway7 or 8 at turn1? Then at turn1 we are at freeway7 or 8? Actually, at turn1 we would be at y1 = 1? But freeway7 is y=7, freeway8 is y=8. So at turn1 we cannot be at y=7 or 8? Because we start at 0 and we can only move by 1 per turn. So at turn1 we can be at y=0 (if we stay) or y=1 (if we go up). \n\nTherefore, we cannot be at freeway7 (y=7) at turn0 or turn1? We are not at y=7 at turn0 or turn1 because we are at y=0. Similarly, we cannot be at freeway8 at turn0 or turn1. So the constraints for freeway7 and freeway8 at T=0,1 are automatically satisfied because we are not there.\n\nBut we must avoid being at freeway7 at T=8,9 and freeway8 at T=8,9? \n\nSimilarly, freeway1: avoid at T=16,17,18,19.\n\nWe wish to minimize the number of turns.\n\nWithout obstacles, the minimal path is to go up every turn: \n   Turn0: U -> y1=1\n   Turn1: U -> y2=2\n   ...\n   Turn8: U -> y9=9.\n\nTotal 9 turns (from turn0 to turn8, so H=9 turns? But note: we start at turn0 and take actions at turn0, turn1, ... turn8 (9 actions) and then at turn9 we are at y9? Actually, we are at y after the action.\n\nAt turn0: we are at y0=0. Then we take action at turn0 and move to y1 at turn1. We wish to be at y=9 at the last action? The problem says: we wish to have y_{t1+H-1}=9. \n\nWe start at t1=0. Then the last turn index in the sequence is t1+H-1 = H-1. And we wish that at the beginning of turn H-1? Actually, the player position after H actions: \n\n   We take H actions: from t=0 to t=H-1 (so t0, t1, ..., t_{H-1}).\n\n   Then the position at the next state (turn H) would be y_H. But the problem says: we require that at turn t1+H-1 (which is turn H-1) the position is (0,9). \n\n   Actually, note: the sequence of actions is taken from t1 (which is 0) to t1+H-1 (so the last action is at time H-1). Then the position at the time after the last action is y_{t1+H} = y_H. But we require the position at the last action time? \n\n   The problem states: \"reach (0,9)\" at turn t1+H-1. \n\n   How the game works: \n        At turn t, the player is at (0, y_t). Then we choose an action a_t. Then the player updates to y_{t+1} = y_t + delta, and the cars move. Then we are at turn t+1.\n\n   Therefore, at the beginning of turn t, we are at y_t. We take action a_t and then we are at y_{t+1} at the beginning of turn t+1.\n\n   The requirement is that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9). \n\n   But note: we start at turn0 (t1=0) at y0=0. Then at the beginning of turn0, we are at y0=0. We take an action at turn0 and then at the beginning of turn1, we are at y1.\n\n   So we wish to have at the beginning of turn (H-1) the y-coordinate is 9.\n\n   How many actions? We take actions at turns: 0, 1, 2, ..., H-2 (if we have H-1 actions) then at the beginning of turn H-1 we are at 9? \n\n   Actually, the problem says: we are to find a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t} for t=0 to H-1 (so H actions) such that after these H actions, the position at the next turn (turn t1+H) is 9? But the problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\n   Let me parse the indices:\n\n        t = 0: we take action a_{t1+0} = a0 at turn0 -> then at turn1, we are at y1.\n        t = 1: action a1 at turn1 -> then at turn2, y2.\n        ...\n        t = H-1: action a_{t1+H-1} = a_{H-1} at turn H-1 -> then at turn H, we are at y_H.\n\n   But the problem requires: at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 (which is turn H-1) we are at (0,9). \n\n   However, at the beginning of turn H-1, we are at y_{H-1}. Then we take an action a_{H-1} and move to y_H. So the requirement is that at the beginning of turn H-1, we are at 9? Then we take an action? But then we leave 9? \n\n   Actually, the goal is to be at (0,9). We don't require to stay there? We require that at the beginning of turn H-1, we are at (0,9). Then we take the last action (which might be S) and then we are still at 9? Or we might leave? But the problem says \"reach (0,9)\" at turn t1+H-1. \n\n   So we require y_{H-1} = 9.\n\n   How many actions? We have actions from turn0 to turn H-2? Because the last action we take is at turn H-2 to get to y_{H-1} at turn H-1? \n\n   Actually, we have H actions: \n        Action at turn0 -> leads to y1 at turn1.\n        Action at turn1 -> leads to y2 at turn2.\n        ...\n        Action at turn H-2 -> leads to y_{H-1} at turn H-1.\n\n   Then we require that at the beginning of turn H-1, we are at 9. \n\n   So the sequence of actions is for t=0 to t=H-2? But the problem says: {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} -> so that's H actions: indices 0 to H-1. \n\n   And we require that after these H actions, the position at turn t1+H-1 is 9. \n\n   How does that work? \n        After the first action (at turn0) we get to y1 at turn1.\n        After the second action (at turn1) we get to y2 at turn2.\n        ...\n        After the k-th action (at turn k-1) we get to y_k at turn k.\n\n   Then after the H-th action (at turn H-1) we get to y_H at turn H.\n\n   But the requirement is that at turn t1+H-1 (which is turn H-1) we are at 9? But at turn H-1, we are at y_{H-1} (before taking the action). Then we take the H-th action and then we are at y_H.\n\n   So the problem requires that at the beginning of turn H-1, we are at 9? \n\n   This is confusing.\n\n   Let me read the problem again: \n        \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\n        and \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\"\n\n   This suggests that at the beginning of turn (t1+H-1) we are at (0,9). \n\n   How many actions have been taken by then? \n        We start at turn t1 (0). Then we take actions at turn t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1. \n        The last action is taken at turn t1+H-1 (which is H-1). \n\n   But note: the position is updated after the action. So at the beginning of turn t1 (0), we are at (0,0). Then we take an action at turn0 and then at the beginning of turn1, we are at y1. \n\n   So at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 (turn H-1), we are at y_{H-1}. We require y_{H-1}=9. \n\n   Then we take the last action at turn H-1 (the H-th action) and then we move to y_H. \n\n   But the problem doesn't care about y_H? It only cares that at the beginning of turn H-1 we are at 9. \n\n   So the actions we take: \n        Action at turn0: a0 -> leads to y1 at turn1.\n        ...\n        Action at turn H-2: a_{H-2} -> leads to y_{H-1} at turn H-1.\n\n        Then we take an action at turn H-1: a_{H-1} -> leads to y_H at turn H.\n\n   But we don't require anything about y_H. We only require that at the beginning of turn H-1 (before taking the last action) we are at 9.\n\n   Therefore, the minimal H would be such that we get to 9 at turn H-1. \n\n   How many actions? We have H actions: from turn0 to turn H-1. \n\n   How many turns to get to 9? \n        Without obstacles: \n            We start at y0=0 at turn0.\n            We want y_{H-1}=9.\n\n            The minimal H-1 is 9? Because we need 9 moves upward? \n\n            So if we move up every turn, then:\n                turn0: a0=U -> y1=1 (at turn1)\n                turn1: a1=U -> y2=2 (at turn2)\n                ...\n                turn8: a8=U -> y9=9 (at turn9)\n\n            Then at the beginning of turn9, we are at 9. So H-1 = 9 -> H=10.\n\n            But we have taken 10 actions? (from turn0 to turn9) -> 10 actions.\n\n        However, the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\". \n\n        Alternatively, note that we start at turn0 and we wish to be at 9 at turn9 (which is the 10th turn? but turns are 0-indexed). \n\n        The problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\" and the sequence has H actions. And we require that at the beginning of turn H-1 we are at 9.\n\n        So without obstacles, H=10: we take 10 actions (at turns0 to 9) and at turn9 (which is H-1, since H=10 -> H-1=9) we are at 9.\n\n        But then we are taking an extra action at turn9? But we are already at 9. The problem doesn't say we have to stop? We just have to be at 9 at the beginning of turn H-1.\n\n        Alternatively, we could stop at turn8: \n            Then we take actions from turn0 to turn8 (9 actions) and then at the beginning of turn9 we are at 9? \n            How? \n                turn0: U -> y1=1 at turn1\n                ...\n                turn8: U -> y9=9 at turn9.\n\n            So at turn9 (which is the beginning of turn9) we are at 9. Then H-1=9 -> H=10? \n\n        But wait: the last action we take is at turn8 (the 9th action) and we require that at turn H-1=9 we are at 9. So that matches.\n\n        Actually, the sequence of actions has H actions: \n            a0, a1, ..., a_{H-1}. \n            The last action is a_{H-1} taken at turn (t1+H-1) = H-1.\n\n        And we require that at the beginning of turn H-1 we are at 9? But then we take an action at turn H-1? \n\n        This suggests that we are at 9 at the beginning of turn H-1, then we take an action (which might move us away) and then we are at y_H.\n\n        But the problem doesn't require that we stay at 9. It only requires that at turn H-1 we are at 9.\n\n        Therefore, without obstacles, we can do:\n            Actions: 9 upward moves: \n                a0=U, a1=U, ... a8=U -> then at the beginning of turn9 we are at 9? \n                But then we have taken 9 actions? Then H=9, and the last action is at turn8 (which is t1+8) and we require that at turn t1+H-1 = 0+9-1=8 we are at 9? \n                However, at the beginning of turn8 we are at y8, which is 8 (if we started at 0 and took 8 ups: from turn0 to turn7, then at turn8 we are at 8). \n\n        How do we get to 9 at turn8? We cannot.\n\n        Therefore, we need 9 upward moves to get from 0 to 9, and the 9th upward move moves us from 8 (at turn8) to 9 at turn9. So at the beginning of turn9 we are at 9.\n\n        Then we take 9 actions: from turn0 to turn8? Then H=9, and we require that at turn H-1=8 we are at 9? But at the beginning of turn8 we are at 8, then we take the 9th action (at turn8) and then at turn9 we are at 9. But the requirement is at turn8 we are at 9? That fails.\n\n        So we must have H=10: \n            Actions: 9 ups and then one more action? \n            Actually, we take 9 ups: \n                turn0: U -> y1=1 at turn1\n                turn1: U -> y2=2 at turn2\n                ...\n                turn8: U -> y9=9 at turn9.\n\n            Then at the beginning of turn9 we are at 9. \n\n            And we take an action at turn9? That would be the 10th action. But we require that at turn H-1=9 (since H=10) we are at 9. So that matches.\n\n            And the last action at turn9 can be anything? Because we are already at 9. But we must avoid collisions? At turn9, we are at freeway9? which is safe. So we can do S (stay).\n\n        Therefore, without obstacles, we need H=10: 9 U and then one S? But note, we can do 10 U: but that would take us to 10? but we are capped at 9. So at turn9: we are at 9, then we do U -> but then y10=10 -> but the grid only goes to 9, so it stays at 9? \n\n        The update: y_{t+1} = min(max(y_t+Δ,0),9). So if we are at 9 and do U, we stay at 9.\n\n        So we can do 10 U's: \n            turn0: U -> y1=1\n            turn1: U -> y2=2\n            ...\n            turn8: U -> y9=9\n            turn9: U -> y10=min(9+1,9)=9.\n\n        Then at turn9 (the beginning of turn9) we are at 9? Actually, no: \n            At the beginning of turn9, we are at y9 (which is 9) -> that's what we want. Then we take the 10th action (at turn9) which is U, and then we are still at 9 at the beginning of turn10, but that doesn't matter.\n\n        So the minimal H without obstacles is 10.\n\nBut we have obstacles. We must avoid collisions on freeways 1-8 at the turns when we are there.\n\nThe direct path: \n   We plan to go up every turn: \n        Turn0: at y0=0 -> safe (not on freeway)\n        Turn1: at y1=1 -> freeway1. We must avoid being at freeway1 at turns 16,17,18,19. But turn1 is 1, which is not in [16,19] -> safe.\n        Turn2: y2=2 -> freeway2: safe (no car ever at 0)\n        Turn3: y3=3 -> freeway3: safe\n        Turn4: y4=4 -> freeway4: safe\n        Turn5: y5=5 -> freeway5: safe\n        Turn6: y6=6 -> freeway6: safe at any turn except turn0 -> and we are at turn6? safe.\n        Turn7: y7=7 -> freeway7: we must avoid at T=0,1,8,9. Turn7 is 7 -> not 0,1,8,9 -> safe.\n        Turn8: y8=8 -> freeway8: avoid T=0,1,8,9. We are at turn8 -> which is in the set {8,9}? We must avoid turn8? So if we are at freeway8 at turn8, we collide? \n\n        Why? The first car on freeway8: (-48,-59,right,6) -> at turn8: [ -59+6*8, -48+6*8 ] = [-59+48, -48+48] = [-11,0] -> which includes 0. So collision.\n\n        Therefore, we cannot be at freeway8 at turn8.\n\n        Also, we must avoid freeway7 at turn8? But we are at freeway7 at turn7 and freeway8 at turn8. \n\n        At turn7: we are at freeway7. At turn7, the cars on freeway7: \n            First car: at turn7: [-59+6*7, -48+6*7] = [-59+42, -48+42] = [-17,-6] -> doesn't cover 0? \n            Second car: [ -11+6*7, 0+6*7] = [31,42] -> doesn't cover 0.\n            So freeway7 at turn7 is safe.\n\n        But freeway8 at turn8: collision.\n\n        So we must avoid being at freeway8 at turn8.\n\n        How can we avoid? We could wait at y=7 for one turn? \n\n        Plan:\n          We go up until y=7 at turn7. \n          Then at turn7: we do not go up (because then at turn8 we would be at y=8 and collide). Instead, we can:\n              Option1: Stay at y=7 at turn7 -> then at turn8 we are still at y=7? \n                        But at turn7 we are at y7=7 -> we take action at turn7: if we do S, then y8=7 (at turn8). Then at turn8 we are at freeway7. \n                        Check freeway7 at turn8: \n                            First car: [-59+6*8, -48+6*8] = [-11,0] -> covers 0? yes -> so collision at turn8? \n                        So we cannot stay at freeway7 at turn8.\n\n              Option2: Go down? Then at turn8 we go to y=6? Then at turn8 we are at freeway6 -> which is safe? \n                        But freeway6: at turn8: \n                            The first car: (48,37,12) -> at turn8: [37+12*8, 48+12*8] = [37+96,48+96]=[133,144] -> safe.\n                            The second car: (0,-11,12) -> at turn8: [-11+12*8, 0+12*8]=[85,96] -> safe.\n                        So freeway6 is safe at turn8.\n\n          Then we can do:\n              turn7: D -> then at turn8 we are at y=6.\n              Then at turn8: we go up -> then at turn9 we are at y=7? \n                        At turn9: freeway7 -> we must avoid T=0,1,8,9. Turn9 is 9 -> which is in the set? \n                        Check freeway7 at turn9: \n                            First car: [-59+6*9, -48+6*9] = [-59+54, -48+54] = [-5,6] -> covers 0? yes -> collision.\n\n          So we cannot be at freeway7 at turn9.\n\n          How about at turn8: after going down to 6, we stay? \n              turn8: S -> then at turn9 we are at 6? \n              Then we are safe at freeway6 at turn9? \n                  freeway6 at turn9: \n                      first car: [37+12*9,48+12*9]=[145,156] -> safe.\n                      second car: [-11+12*9, 0+12*9]=[97,108] -> safe.\n\n          But then we are at 6 at turn9, and we need to get to 9. We still have 3 steps to go.\n\n          Then we can go up at turn9: to 7 -> but then at turn10 we are at freeway7. \n                  Check freeway7 at turn10: \n                      First car: [-59+60, -48+60] = [1,12] -> doesn't cover 0? safe.\n                      Second car: [-11+60,0+60] = [49,60] -> safe.\n\n          Then turn10: U -> to 8 -> freeway8 at turn10: \n                  First car: [-59+6*10, -48+6*10]=[1,12] -> safe.\n                  Second car: [-11+6*10,0+6*10]=[49,60] -> safe.\n\n          Then turn11: U -> to 9.\n\n          Then at the beginning of turn11 we are at 9? \n          How many actions? We did:\n              turn0: U -> to 1\n              turn1: U -> to 2\n              ...\n              turn6: U -> to 7\n              turn7: D -> to 6\n              turn8: S -> to 6\n              turn9: U -> to 7\n              turn10: U -> to 8\n              turn11: U -> to 9   -> but we are at 9 at the beginning of turn12? \n\n          Actually, we want to be at 9 at the beginning of turn (H-1). \n\n          We have taken 12 actions: from turn0 to turn11. Then H=12, so we require at turn H-1=11 we are at 9? \n          At the beginning of turn11, we are at y11. How did we get there?\n                turn10: we were at 8 (at the beginning of turn10). Then we took U at turn10 -> then at turn11 we are at 9? \n          So at turn11 we are at 9. Then we take the last action (at turn11) which is U, and then we go to 9 (or stay). \n\n          Therefore, H=12.\n\n          But we can do better?\n\nAlternative: at turn7, we go down to 6, then at turn8 we go up to 7? But then at turn8: we go from 6 to 7 -> then at turn9 we are at 7? \n          But freeway7 at turn9: collision.\n\n          So that doesn't work.\n\nAnother idea: at turn7, we stay at 7? Then at turn8 we are at 7 -> but freeway7 at turn8: collision (because the first car at turn8: [-11,0] covers 0). \n\n          So we cannot stay at 7 at turn7? Because then at turn8 we are at 7? \n\n          Actually, if we stay at 7 at turn7, then at the beginning of turn8 we are at 7? Then we take an action at turn8. But at turn8, we are at freeway7 -> and the car covers 0? So collision at turn8.\n\n          Therefore, we must leave freeway7 at turn7? We can only go up or down? Down to 6, up to 8? But up to 8 at turn8: collision.\n\n          So only down to 6.\n\n          Then at turn8, we are at 6. Then we can:\n              Option: go up at turn8 to 7? -> then at turn9 we are at 7 -> collision at turn9? \n              Option: go down to 5? Then we are at freeway5 at turn8 -> safe? \n                      freeway5: no car ever at 0 -> safe.\n\n          Then we can: \n              turn7: D -> to 6\n              turn8: D -> to 5\n              turn9: U -> to 6\n              turn10: U -> to 7 -> but at turn10, freeway7: safe? \n                      freeway7 at turn10: [ -59+60, -48+60] = [1,12] (first car) and [49,60] (second) -> safe.\n              turn11: U -> to 8 -> freeway8 at turn11: [ -59+66, -48+66] = [7,18] (first car) and [55,66] (second) -> safe.\n              turn12: U -> to 9.\n\n          Then at the beginning of turn12 we are at 9? Then we take action at turn12 (the 13th action) -> so H=13? \n\n          But we want to be at 9 at the beginning of turn H-1. \n          We are at 9 at the beginning of turn12 -> so H-1=12 -> H=13.\n\n          That is worse than the previous plan (which was 12).\n\nWe had a plan that takes 12 actions. But can we do better?\n\nWhat if we slow down earlier? \n\nWe note that freeway8 is only dangerous at turns 8 and 9. So if we can be at freeway8 at turn10, it is safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway7 is dangerous at turns 0,1,8,9 -> so at turn10 it is safe.\n\nSo if we can delay our arrival at freeway7 and freeway8 until turn10 or later, we avoid the collisions.\n\nBut we are moving one step per turn. \n\nWe start at 0 at turn0. We need to get to 9. \n\nWe can take a detour? Or we can wait at a safe freeway for a few turns.\n\nThe safe freeways: \n   freeway1: dangerous at 16,17,18,19 -> so for turns 0 to 15 and 20+ it is safe? \n   freeway2,3,4,5: always safe.\n   freeway6: safe for turns>=1 (so safe from turn1 onward)\n   freeway7: dangerous at 0,1,8,9 -> safe at turns 2,3,4,5,6,7,10,11,...\n   freeway8: same.\n\nSo we can be at freeway7 at turns 2,3,4,5,6,7,10,... and freeway8 at turns 2,3,4,5,6,7,10,...\n\nWe wish to minimize the total turns.\n\nWe need to go from 0 to 9. The minimal time is 9 steps (so we arrive at 9 at turn9). But we cannot be at freeway8 at turn8 or turn9? So we must avoid being at freeway8 at turn8 and turn9. \n\nBut if we go straight, we are at freeway8 at turn8 -> collision.\n\nSo we must be at freeway8 at a turn >=10? \n\nBut if we go straight, we are at freeway8 at turn8. To be at freeway8 at turn10, we have to delay by 2 turns.\n\nSo we can wait at some freeway for 2 turns. Where? We can wait at a safe freeway. \n\nFor example, we can wait at freeway5 (which is always safe) for two turns? \n\nPlan:\n   We go up normally until freeway5 (y=5). \n        turn0: U -> 1\n        turn1: U -> 2\n        turn2: U -> 3\n        turn3: U -> 4\n        turn4: U -> 5 (freeway5) at turn5? Actually, at turn5 we are at 5.\n\n   Then we wait at 5 for two turns? \n        turn5: S -> stay at 5 -> then at turn6 we are at 5.\n        turn6: S -> stay at 5 -> then at turn7 we are at 5.\n\n   Then we continue:\n        turn7: U -> 6 at turn8\n        turn8: U -> 7 at turn9 -> but freeway7 at turn9: dangerous? \n                  freeway7 at turn9: first car: [-5,6] -> covers 0? yes -> collision.\n\n   So we cannot be at freeway7 at turn9.\n\n   Alternatively, we wait at freeway6? \n        freeway6 is safe for all turns>=1. So we can wait at 6.\n\n   How about:\n        turn4: U -> to 5 at turn5? \n        turn5: U -> to 6 at turn6 -> then we are at freeway6 at turn6: safe.\n        Then we wait at 6 for two turns:\n                turn6: S -> at turn7: 6\n                turn7: S -> at turn8: 6\n        Then:\n                turn8: U -> to 7 at turn9 -> freeway7 at turn9: collision.\n\n   Still collision.\n\n   We must avoid freeway7 at turn9. So we want to be at freeway7 at turn10 or later.\n\n   Therefore, we can wait at freeway6 for 3 turns? \n\n        Then:\n          turn0: U ->1\n          turn1: U->2\n          turn2: U->3\n          turn3: U->4\n          turn4: U->5\n          turn5: U->6 -> at turn6: 6\n          turn6: S ->6 (turn7)\n          turn7: S ->6 (turn8)\n          turn8: S ->6 (turn9)\n          turn9: U->7 (turn10) -> freeway7 at turn10: safe (as computed: [1,12] and [49,60])\n          turn10: U->8 (turn11) -> freeway8 at turn11: safe (first car: [7,18], second: [55,66])\n          turn11: U->9 (turn12)\n\n        Then at the beginning of turn12 we are at 9. Then H=12? \n        We have taken 12 actions: from turn0 to turn11. Then H=12, and at turn12-1=11 we are at 9? \n        Actually, at the beginning of turn12 we are at 9? How? \n            At turn11: we are at 8 (beginning of turn11). Then we take U at turn11 -> then at turn12 we are at 9. \n        But the requirement is that at the beginning of turn H-1 (which is turn11) we are at 9? \n            We are at 8 at the beginning of turn11. \n\n        So we need one more action to get to 9 at turn12. Then we take an action at turn12? \n            Then H=13? \n\n        Alternatively, we can be at 9 at the beginning of turn12? \n            Then we must have taken an action at turn11 that moves us from 8 to 9. \n            Then at the beginning of turn12 we are at 9. \n            Then we take the last action at turn12? \n\n        But we require that at turn H-1=12-1=11 we are at 9? We are at 9 at the beginning of turn12, not turn11.\n\n        So we must be at 9 at the beginning of turn11? \n            How? \n                turn10: U -> from 7 to 8 at turn11? \n                then at the beginning of turn11 we are at 8. \n                Then we need to get to 9 at the beginning of turn11? That's impossible because we can only move one per turn.\n\n        Therefore, the earliest we can be at 9 is at the beginning of turn9: \n            by taking 9 consecutive U's: \n                turn0:U->1 (turn1)\n                ...\n                turn8:U->9 (turn9)\n\n            Then at the beginning of turn9 we are at 9. Then we take an action at turn9? \n            So we need 10 actions to be at 9 at turn9? But we have to avoid obstacles.\n\n        In our detour, we are at 8 at the beginning of turn11. Then at turn11 we take U -> then at turn12 we are at 9. \n        Then we take an action at turn12? So we have 12 actions so far? But we haven't included the last action? \n\n        We are required to provide a sequence of H actions that results in being at 9 at the beginning of turn H-1. \n\n        How do we get to 9 at the beginning of turn11? \n            We would need to be at 9 at the beginning of turn11. \n            That means we were at 8 at the beginning of turn10, then we took U at turn10 to get to 9 at turn11.\n\n        So in our plan:\n            turn0: U->1\n            turn1: U->2\n            turn2: U->3\n            turn3: U->4\n            turn4: U->5\n            turn5: U->6\n            turn6: S->6\n            turn7: S->6\n            turn8: S->6\n            turn9: U->7 (at turn10)\n            turn10: U->8 (at turn11)\n            turn11: U->9 (at turn12)\n\n        Then at the beginning of turn12 we are at 9. \n        We took 12 actions. We require that at turn H-1=11 we are at 9? But at the beginning of turn11 we are at 8.\n\n        Therefore, we need to be at 9 at the beginning of turn12. Then we take an action at turn12 (the 13th action) -> then H=13.\n\n        But note: the requirement is to be at 9 at the beginning of turn H-1. \n            So if we want to be at 9 at the beginning of turn12, then we set H-1=12 -> H=13.\n\n        So we take 13 actions: \n            turn0 to turn12.\n\n        And at the beginning of turn12 we are at 9.\n\n        How? \n            We have:\n                turn0: U -> at turn1:1\n                ...\n                turn11: U -> at turn12: we are at 9? \n                But how do we get to 9 at turn12? \n                    We were at 8 at the beginning of turn11. Then we take U at turn11 -> then at turn12 we are at 9.\n\n            So the last action (turn11) is U, and it moves us from 8 to 9 at turn12.\n\n        Then we take one more action at turn12? But we are already at 9. The problem doesn't say we have to stop, so we can take an action at turn12 (which is the 13th action) and then we are still at 9? \n\n        But the requirement is that at the beginning of turn12 (before taking the 12th action) we are at 9? \n\n        Actually, we are at 9 at the beginning of turn12 only if we were moved there by the action at turn11. \n\n        And then we take an action at turn12? \n\n        But the problem requires the sequence of actions for t=0 to H-1 (13 actions) and that at the beginning of turn H-1=12 we are at 9. \n\n        That matches.\n\n        So the plan with 13 actions:\n\n            turn0: U -> 1\n            turn1: U -> 2\n            turn2: U -> 3\n            turn3: U -> 4\n            turn4: U -> 5\n            turn5: U -> 6\n            turn6: S -> 6\n            turn7: S -> 6\n            turn8: S -> 6\n            turn9: U -> 7 (at turn10)\n            turn10: U -> 8 (at turn11)\n            turn11: U -> 9 (at turn12)\n            turn12: S (or U, doesn't matter) -> still 9 at turn13, but we don't care.\n\n        But wait: at turn9: we are at freeway6 at turn9? safe.\n        turn10: we move to freeway7 at turn10: safe (as computed: turn10 is safe for freeway7).\n        turn11: we move to freeway8 at turn11: safe (turn11: freeway8: first car: [-59+66, -48+66]=[7,18] -> doesn't include 0; second car: [-11+66,0+66]=[55,66] -> safe).\n        turn12: we are at freeway9? safe.\n\n        And at the beginning of turn12 we are at 9? \n\n        How many actions: 13 (turn0 to turn12). Then H=13.\n\n        But we had a plan in 12 actions earlier? \n\n        Earlier plan was:\n            turn0 to turn6: 7 U's -> then at turn7: we are at 7.\n            turn7: D -> then at turn8: we are at 6.\n            turn8: S -> at turn9: 6.\n            turn9: U -> at turn10: 7.\n            turn10: U -> at turn11: 8.\n            turn11: U -> at turn12: 9.\n\n            Then at the beginning of turn12 we are at 9. We took 12 actions: turn0 to turn11. Then H=12? \n            But we require that at turn H-1=11 we are at 9? \n                At the beginning of turn11 we are at 8. \n\n            So we need one more action: at turn11 we take U to go to 9 at turn12. Then we take an action at turn12? \n            Then H=13.\n\n        Alternatively, if we do not take an action at turn12, but we only take 12 actions? Then the last action is at turn11, and we require that at turn12-1=11 we are at 9? \n            At the beginning of turn11 we are at 8 -> not 9.\n\n        So both plans require 13 actions.\n\n        But wait: in the first detour plan I described 12 actions? That was:\n\n            turn0: U ->1\n            turn1: U ->2\n            ...\n            turn6: U ->7\n            turn7: D ->6\n            turn8: S ->6\n            turn9: U ->7\n            turn10: U ->8\n            turn11: U ->9\n\n            Then at turn12 we are at 9? \n                How: \n                    turn11: U -> from 8 (at turn11) to 9 (at turn12).\n                So at the beginning of turn12 we are at 9.\n\n            And we have taken 12 actions: from turn0 to turn11. Then H=12, and we require that at turn12-1=11 we are at 9? \n                At the beginning of turn11 we are at 8 -> not 9.\n\n        Therefore, we need to be at 9 at the beginning of turn11. How? \n            We would have to be at 8 at the beginning of turn10, then take U at turn10 to be at 9 at turn11.\n\n        So if we adjust the first detour plan to be faster:\n\n            turn0: U ->1\n            turn1: U ->2\n            turn2: U ->3\n            turn3: U ->4\n            turn4: U ->5\n            turn5: U ->6\n            turn6: U ->7  (at turn7)\n            turn7: D ->6  (at turn8)   -> now at turn8 we are at 6.\n            turn8: U ->7  (at turn9)   -> freeway7 at turn9: collision? \n            Because freeway7 at turn9: first car: [-5,6] -> covers 0 -> collision.\n\n        So we cannot be at freeway7 at turn9.\n\n        We must wait until turn10 to be at freeway7.\n\n        Therefore, we cannot avoid the extra wait.\n\n        The minimal H is 13.\n\n        Let's choose the first detour plan with waiting at 6 for three turns? \n\n        But we have an alternative: wait at a safe freeway for two turns and then go, but we saw that we still collide at freeway7 at turn9.\n\n        Or we can wait at freeway5 for three turns? \n\n        Plan A (wait at 6 for three turns):\n            Actions:\n              turn0: U\n              turn1: U\n              turn2: U\n              turn3: U\n              turn4: U\n              turn5: U  -> at turn6: 6\n              turn6: S  -> at turn7: 6\n              turn7: S  -> at turn8: 6\n              turn8: S  -> at turn9: 6\n              turn9: U  -> at turn10: 7\n              turn10: U -> at turn11: 8\n              turn11: U -> at turn12: 9\n              turn12: S (or U)   [but we only care until we are at 9 at the beginning of turn12?]\n\n        But note: we are at 9 at the beginning of turn12. Then we take the last action at turn12? Then H=13.\n\n        We can stop at turn11? \n            We wish to be at 9 at the beginning of turn (H-1). \n            If we take 12 actions: from turn0 to turn11, then we require at turn11 (which is H-1) we are at 9. \n            But in the above, at the beginning of turn11 we are at 8.\n\n        So we need to be at 9 at the beginning of turn11? \n            Then we would have taken:\n                turn0:U->1\n                turn1:U->2\n                turn2:U->3\n                turn3:U->4\n                turn4:U->5\n                turn5:U->6\n                turn6:U->7 (at turn7)\n                turn7: we cannot go to 8 at turn8 (collision) -> so we have to wait somewhere.\n\n            We can wait at freeway5 for one turn? \n                turn5: we are at 5 at turn6? \n                turn6: S -> 5 at turn7? \n                turn7: U->6 at turn8\n                turn8: U->7 at turn9 -> collision at freeway7 at turn9.\n\n        So we have to wait two turns? \n                turn5: at 5 at turn6\n                turn6: S ->5 at turn7\n                turn7: S ->5 at turn8\n                turn8: U->6 at turn9\n                turn9: U->7 at turn10 -> safe\n                turn10: U->8 at turn11 -> safe\n                turn11: U->9 at turn12\n\n            Then at the beginning of turn12 we are at 9. \n            We have 12 actions? \n                turn0 to turn11: 12 actions -> H=12.\n            But then we require at turn12-1=11 we are at 9? \n                At the beginning of turn11 we are at 8.\n\n        Therefore, we must take an action at turn11 to move to 9 at turn12, and then an action at turn12? Then H=13.\n\n        Or if we wish to be at 9 at the beginning of turn11, we would need to be at 8 at the beginning of turn10 and then take U at turn10 to be at 9 at turn11.\n\n        How to be at 8 at the beginning of turn10? \n            turn0:U->1\n            turn1:U->2\n            turn2:U->3\n            turn3:U->4\n            turn4:U->5\n            turn5:U->6\n            turn6:U->7 (at turn7)\n            then we have to wait somewhere: \n                turn7: we can't go to 8 at turn8 (collision) -> so we go down to 6 at turn8? \n                turn7: D->6 (at turn8)\n                turn8: we can go up to 7 at turn9? -> but freeway7 at turn9: collision.\n                turn8: we can go down to 5 at turn9? \n                turn8: D->5 (at turn9)\n                turn9: U->6 (at turn10) -> then at turn10 we are at 6, not 8.\n\n        It seems we cannot be at 8 at turn10.\n\n        Therefore, the minimal H is 13.\n\n        We choose the plan that waits at freeway6 for three turns.\n\n        But note: we have to avoid freeway1 at turns 16,17,18,19? \n          In our plan, we are at freeway1 at turn1? which is 1, safe. \n          And we are done by turn12, so turns 16+ are not an issue.\n\n        Also, freeway7 and freeway8 are safe at the turns we are there: \n          freeway7 at turn10: safe\n          freeway8 at turn11: safe\n\n        So the plan is valid.\n\n        Actions for 13 turns:\n\n          turn0: U\n          turn1: U\n          turn2: U\n          turn3: U\n          turn4: U\n          turn5: U   (now at turn6: y=6)\n          turn6: S   (wait at 6)\n          turn7: S   (wait at 6)\n          turn8: S   (wait at 6)\n          turn9: U   (now at turn10: y=7)\n          turn10: U  (now at turn11: y=8)\n          turn11: U  (now at turn12: y=9)\n          turn12: S  (or U, doesn't matter)\n\n        But the problem only requires the actions until we reach 9 at the last action? \n          The last action is at turn12, and at the beginning of turn12 we are at 9. \n\n        However, the requirement is that at the beginning of turn12 (which is H-1, since H=13) we are at 9. \n        Then we take an action at turn12 (which is the 13th action).\n\n        So we must include the action at turn12.\n\n        We can choose any action at turn12, since we are at 9 and it's safe.\n\n        Let's choose S.\n\n        Therefore, the answer is:\n\n          Turn 0: U\n          Turn 1: U\n          Turn 2: U\n          Turn 3: U\n          Turn 4: U\n          Turn 5: U\n          Turn 6: S\n          Turn 7: S\n          Turn 8: S\n          Turn 9: U\n          Turn 10: U\n          Turn 11: U\n          Turn 12: S\n\n        But note: at turn5: we are at freeway5? safe.\n        at turn6: freeway6 at turn6: safe? \n            freeway6: at turn6: \n                first car: (48,37,12): [37+12*6, 48+12*6] = [109,120] -> safe.\n                second car: (0,-11,12): [-11+12*6, 0+12*6] = [61,72] -> safe.\n        at turn7: freeway6 at turn7: [37+84,48+84]=[121,132] and [-11+84,84]=[73,84] -> safe.\n        at turn8: similarly safe.\n        at turn9: freeway6 at turn9: [37+108,48+108]=[145,156] and [-11+108,108]=[97,108] -> safe.\n        at turn10: freeway7: as above, safe.\n        at turn11: freeway8: safe.\n\n        And at turn12: we are at 9 -> safe.\n\n        So it works.\n\n        Is there a plan with H=12? \n          We need to be at 9 at the beginning of turn11 (because H-1=11). \n          How to be at 9 at the beginning of turn11? \n             We must be at 8 at the beginning of turn10, then take U at turn10 to get to 9 at turn11.\n\n          How to be at 8 at the beginning of turn10? \n             We must be at 7 at the beginning of turn9, then take U at turn9 to get to 8 at turn10.\n             But freeway7 at turn9: collision. \n\n          Therefore, we cannot be at 7 at the beginning of turn9.\n\n          Alternatively, we can be at 8 at the beginning of turn10 by:\n             turn0:0 -> turn0: U ->1 at turn1\n             turn1: U ->2 at turn2\n             turn2: U ->3 at turn3\n             turn3: U ->4 at turn4\n             turn4: U ->5 at turn5\n             turn5: U ->6 at turn6\n             turn6: U ->7 at turn7\n             turn7: we want to be at 8 at turn8? -> but freeway8 at turn8: collision.\n             turn7: D ->6 at turn8\n             turn8: U ->7 at turn9 -> collision at freeway7 at turn9.\n\n          So we cannot.\n\n        Hence, minimal H is 13.\n\n        We output the 13 actions.\n\n        However, note that in the car state, freeway6 has two cars? \n          But we are at freeway6 for turns6,7,8,9 and we checked: at these turns, the cars are not at 0.\n\n        Therefore, the answer is as above.\n\nBut wait, there is a faster way? \n\nWe can go down at the beginning to avoid the high freeways until later? \n\nFor example, we could go down to 0 and wait there? But we start at 0. \n   If we stay at 0 for a few turns? \n        turn0: S ->0 at turn1\n        turn1: S ->0 at turn2\n        ...\n\n   But then we are not making progress.\n\nAlternatively, we can go down from 0? But we are at 0, and down would go to 0? \n\n   We can only go up.\n\n   So we have to go up eventually.\n\nAnother idea: we can go up to freeway4 or 5 and wait there for more turns, but that won't save time.\n\nTherefore, we output the plan with 13 turns.\n\nBut note: we might be able to wait only two turns? \n\n   In the plan that waits at freeway6 for three turns, we are at freeway6 for turns6,7,8,9 (four turns: from turn6 to turn9). But we only need to avoid freeway7 and freeway8 until turn10. \n\n   We can be at freeway7 at turn10. So we only need to delay by two turns? \n\n   How many turns do we spend from turn0 to turn5: 6 turns (actions) to get to 6 at turn6. \n        Then if we wait only two turns at 6: \n            turn6: S ->6 at turn7\n            turn7: S ->6 at turn8\n            turn8: U ->7 at turn9 -> collision at freeway7 at turn9.\n\n   So we need to wait until turn9 to leave 6? \n\n   Then:\n        turn8: S ->6 at turn9\n        turn9: U ->7 at turn10: safe.\n\n   That is three waits at 6: turns6,7,8 -> three actions of S at turn6,7,8.\n\n   But then we are at 6 at turn9, and then we go to 7 at turn10.\n\n   So we still need to go from 7 to 9: two more steps: turn10: to 8, turn11: to 9.\n\n   Then at turn12: we take the last action.\n\n   So it's the same: 13 actions.\n\n   Alternatively, we can wait one turn less by being faster in the beginning? \n\n   We start at 0. We have to go up 9 times. The minimal number of turns is 9 if there are no obstacles. With obstacles, we have to add 3 waits.\n\n   So 9 moves up and 3 waits -> 12 moves? But then we have to account for the last action? \n\n   We have 12 actions: 9 U and 3 S. Then we would be at 9 at turn12? \n        turn0:U->1\n        turn1:U->2\n        turn2:U->3\n        turn3:U->4\n        turn4:U->5\n        turn5:U->6\n        turn6:S->6\n        turn7:S->6\n        turn8:S->6\n        turn9:U->7\n        turn10:U->8\n        turn11:U->9   -> then at turn12 we are at 9.\n\n        Then we take an action at turn12? So we need 13 actions.\n\n   But if we do not take an action at turn12, and only take 12 actions, then we require that at turn12-1=11 we are at 9. \n        At the beginning of turn11 we are at 8.\n\n   So we need the 12th action (at turn11) to be U, which moves us to 9 at turn12. Then we are at 9 at the beginning of turn12, and then we take the 13th action at turn12.\n\n   So it's 13 actions.\n\n   Therefore, we output the 13 actions.\n\nFinal answer:\n\nTurn 0: U\nTurn 1: U\nTurn 2: U\nTurn 3: U\nTurn 4: U\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: S\nTurn 7: S\nTurn 8: S\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: S\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" and t1 is 0.\n\nSo we write:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 0: U\nTurn 1: U\nTurn 2: U\nTurn 3: U\nTurn 4: U\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: S\nTurn 7: S\nTurn 8: S\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: S\n}\n\nBut let me double-check the freeway7 at turn10: \n   First car: (-48,-59,right,6) at turn10: [ -59+6*10, -48+6*10 ] = [1,12] -> does not include 0? -> safe.\n   Second car: (0,-11,right,6) at turn10: [ -11+60, 0+60 ] = [49,60] -> safe.\n\nFreeway8 at turn11: \n   First car: (-48,-59,right,6) at turn11: [ -59+66, -48+66 ] = [7,18] -> safe.\n   Second car: (0,-11,right,6) at turn11: [ -11+66, 0+66 ] = [55,66] -> safe.\n\nAnd we are never at freeway7 at turn8 or 9? \n   At turn8: we are at 6 -> freeway6 -> safe.\n   At turn9: we are at 6 -> freeway6 -> safe.\n\nAnd freeway6 at turn6,7,8,9: \n   We already computed: the cars are at positions that do not cover 0.\n\nTherefore, the plan is safe.\n\nMinimal H: 13.\n\nBut note: is there a plan with H=12? We think not.\n\nHowever, we might use down and up more cleverly to save one turn? \n\nFor example, after reaching 7 at turn7, we go down to 6 at turn8 (as before), but then at turn8 we go down to 5 at turn9? \n   Then at turn9: freeway5 -> safe.\n   Then at turn10: U->6\n   turn11: U->7 -> freeway7 at turn11: safe? \n        freeway7 at turn11: \n            first car: [-59+66, -48+66] = [7,18] -> safe.\n            second car: [-11+66,0+66]=[55,66] -> safe.\n        then at turn12: U->8 -> freeway8 at turn12: \n            first car: [-59+72, -48+72]=[13,24] -> safe.\n            second car: [-11+72,72]=[61,72] -> safe.\n        then at turn13: U->9.\n\n   That's 14 actions.\n\nNot better.\n\nAlternatively, after being at 7 at turn7, we go down to 6 at turn8, then at turn8 we go up to 7 at turn9 -> collision at freeway7 at turn9.\n\nSo no.\n\nWe might leave the upward path earlier? \n\nFor example, at turn4 we are at 5. Instead of going to 6 at turn5, we stay at 5 for two turns: \n   turn4: U->5 at turn5\n   turn5: S->5 at turn6\n   turn6: S->5 at turn7\n   turn7: U->6 at turn8\n   turn8: U->7 at turn9 -> collision.\n\nOr we go down from 5? \n   turn5: D->4 at turn6\n   turn6: D->3 at turn7\n   then we are behind.\n\nSo it won't help.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 13.\n\nOutput the answer.\n</think>\nTo reach the goal position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 0) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8, the following sequence of actions is determined. The solution requires 13 turns (H=13) to ensure the player is at y=9 at the beginning of turn 12 (since H-1=12), and the last action is taken at turn 12.\n\nThe car configurations and their movements are analyzed to avoid collisions:\n- Freeway 1 is unsafe at turns 16-19, but these are not encountered.\n- Freeways 2-5 are always safe.\n- Freeway 6 is unsafe only at turn 0, so it is safe for turns ≥1.\n- Freeways 7 and 8 are unsafe at turns 0, 1, 8, and 9. The path avoids these freeways during unsafe turns.\n\nThe sequence progresses as follows:\n- Turns 0-5: Move up (U) to reach y=6 by turn 6.\n- Turns 6-8: Stay (S) at y=6 to wait out the unsafe turns for freeways 7 and 8 (turns 8 and 9).\n- Turns 9-11: Move up (U) to advance through y=7 (safe at turn 10) and y=8 (safe at turn 11), reaching y=9 at turn 12.\n- Turn 12: Stay (S) to remain at y=9 (the action does not affect the goal).\n\nThis sequence ensures the player is at y=9 at the beginning of turn 12 and avoids all car collisions.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 0: U\nTurn 1: U\nTurn 2: U\nTurn 3: U\nTurn 4: U\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: S\nTurn 7: S\nTurn 8: S\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: S\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to get the player from (0,2) at turn t1=2 to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing the y-position by +1, -1, or 0, staying within 0 to 9.\n\nCollision occurs only if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y where there's a car whose span includes 0 at that exact turn. Importantly, if the player moves to a new y at turn T, they are not on that new y until the next turn, so for collision purposes, at turn T, they are on y_T, and only cars on that freeway matter if their span includes 0 at turn T.\n\nThe car spans are given at turn t1=2, and for future turns, they move based on their speed and direction. Left-moving cars decrease their position over time, right-moving increase.\n\nLet me list the car states at turn t1=2:\n\n- Freeway 1: one car, head -42, tail -53, direction right, speed 3. Since direction is right, head should be greater than tail? The notation says for right-moving: span [τ, h] with h > τ, I think. Let me check the update rule.\n\nFor right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T−t1), h + s(T−t1)]\" and it says [τ, h] with τ and h, but in the table, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed). For right-moving, head should be the front, so for right-moving, head > tail, and span is from tail to head, I assume.\n\nIn the freeway 1 entry: \"(-42, -53, right, 3)\". -42 and -53, since it's right-moving, and -42 > -53, so head is -42, tail is -53, so span at t1=2 is [-53, -42]? No.\n\nThe update rule for right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] → moves to [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT]. But in the input, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed). For right-moving, since it's moving right, the head should be the right end, so if head is -42, tail is -53, and -42 > -53, so the span is from left to right: tail to head, so [tail, head] = [-53, -42].\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, it would be [head, tail] with head > tail decreasing.\n\nBut in this case, all cars here are right-moving except possibly others, but looking at the list, all are right-moving.\n\nFreeway 1: (-42, -53, right, 3) so head h=-42, tail τ=-53, direction right, speed 3. Since right-moving, span at t1=2 is [τ, h] = [-53, -42].\n\nThen at time T, span is [-53 + 3(T-2), -42 + 3(T-2)]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: (-48, -59, right, 12), so span at t1=2: [-59, -48]\n\nAt T, [-59 + 12(T-2), -48 + 12(T-2)]\n\nFreeway 3: same as freeway 2? (-48, -59, right, 12), identical to freeway 2.\n\nFreeway 4: same.\n\nFreeway 5: same.\n\nFreeway 6: two cars: first (-48, -59, right, 12) and second (24, 13, right, 12). For the second car, (24, 13, right, 12), head=24, tail=13, since right-moving, span [13,24] at t1=2.\n\nAt T, [13 + 12(T-2), 24 + 12(T-2)]\n\nFirst car same as before.\n\nFreeway 7: two cars: (-36, -47, right, 6) and (12, 1, right, 6)\n\nFor first: head=-36, tail=-47, span [-47, -36] at t1=2\n\nAt T: [-47 + 6(T-2), -36 + 6(T-2)]\n\nSecond: head=12, tail=1, span [1,12] at t1=2\n\nAt T: [1 + 6(T-2), 12 + 6(T-2)]\n\nFreeway 8: same as freeway 7: (-36, -47, right, 6) and (12, 1, right, 6)\n\nNow, player starts at y=2 at turn t1=2.\n\nI need to reach y=9 as soon as possible, so probably moving up as much as possible, but avoiding collisions.\n\nSince moving down might be necessary to avoid cars, but since we need to go to y=9, up is better, so only move down if stuck or to avoid.\n\nBut in this case, since cars are moving, and positions change, I need to find when it's safe to be on each freeway.\n\nCollision happens if at turn T, player is on freeway k, and for that freeway, there is a car whose span includes 0 at time T.\n\nSo for each freeway and each time, I need to know if 0 is in some car's span on that freeway at that time.\n\nSince the player moves one y per turn, and we start at y=2, to reach y=9, we need at least 7 moves up, but since we can stay or move down, H could be more, but minimal H would be if we can go straight up without stopping, so H=7 turns to go from y=2 to y=9 in 7 moves: U,U,U,U,U,U,U, but we have to check for collisions at each position.\n\nAt each turn, when we are at a certain y, we need to be safe on that y at that turn.\n\nLet t be the turn number, starting from t=2.\n\nAt turn t, player is at y_t.\n\nAction a_t determines y_{t+1} = y_t + delta, with delta based on a_t.\n\nBut for collision, at turn t, we care about y_t and cars on that row at time t.\n\nThe sequence: at turn t, we are at y_t, then we choose a_t, which sets y_{t+1} for the next turn.\n\nBut at turn t, we are on freeway y_t, and we check if there is a collision on y_t at time t.\n\nThen we move to y_{t+1} at turn t+1, and so on.\n\nWe start at turn 2, y=2.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at some turn, say T, so at turn T, y_T=9, and we stop, so H is the number of actions, from t=2 to t=2+H-1, with y_{2+H-1}=9.\n\nSince we start at turn 2, after H actions, we are at turn 2+H, position after H actions.\n\nLet's clarify the timing.\n\nTurn t1=2: initial position (0, y_{t1}) = (0,2)\n\nThen we apply actions a_{t1}, a_{t1+1}, ..., a_{t1+H-1}\n\nAfter action a_{t1}, at turn t1+1, position is updated.\n\nThe player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t, where Delta y_t depends on a_t.\n\nSo at turn t, we are at y_t, we choose a_t, which determines Delta y_t, so y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t.\n\nThen at turn t+1, we are at y_{t+1}, and so on.\n\nCollision at turn t if y_t is between 1 and 8, and for freeway y_t, at time t, 0 is in some car's span.\n\nIf y_t=0 or 9, no freeway, so no collision, I assume. y=0 and y=9 are safe, I think, as per the vertical axis y=0,1,2,...,9, and freeways are y=1 to 8.\n\nThe problem says: \"avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y = 1, ..., 8.\" and \"reach (0,9)\", so y=9 should be safe, no cars.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 might be safe, but we start at y=2, and go to y=9.\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need to find for which times t, the freeway is occupied at position 0, meaning 0 is in some car's span at time t.\n\nSince all cars are moving right, and speeds are positive, positions increase over time.\n\nA freeway is unsafe at time t if min_span <= 0 <= max_span for some car on that freeway at time t.\n\nOtherwise safe.\n\nFor freeway k, at time t, unsafe if exists car on k such that low(t) <= 0 <= high(t), where low and high are the span ends at time t.\n\nSince the cars move continuously, but we only care at integer times.\n\nt is turn number, so integer.\n\nNow, let's compute for each freeway the times when it is unsafe.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: one car, span at t=2: [τ, h] = [-53, -42] for the car, but since right-moving, and head=-42, tail=-53, so the span is from left to right: from tail to head, so min = τ = -53, max = h = -42.\n\nAt time t, min(t) = τ + s(t - 2) = -53 + 3(t-2)\n\nMax(t) = h + s(t-2) = -42 + 3(t-2)\n\nUnsafe if min(t) <= 0 <= max(t), i.e., -53 + 3(t-2) <= 0 <= -42 + 3(t-2)\n\nSolve inequalities.\n\nFirst, -53 + 3(t-2) <= 0 => 3(t-2) <= 53 => t-2 <= 53/3 = 17.666, so t-2 <= 17 since t integer? t-2 <= 17.666, so for t-2 <= 17, it holds? Let's see.\n\n-53 + 3(t-2) <= 0 => 3(t-2) <= 53 => t-2 <= 53/3 = 17 + 2/3, so t-2 <= 17 since t integer? t-2 can be up to 17, because 17.666, so for t-2 <= 17, -53 + 3(t-2) <= 0.\n\nt-2 min is 0, t=2.\n\nAt t=2, min= -53 +0 = -53 <=0, yes.\n\nAt t-2=18, min= -53 + 3*18 = -53+54=1 >0, so min>0, so min<=0 false for t-2>=18.\n\nSimilarly, max(t) = -42 + 3(t-2) >=0? 0 <= max(t) when -42 + 3(t-2) >=0 => 3(t-2) >=42 => t-2 >=14.\n\nSo for t-2 >=14, max(t) >=0.\n\nNow, unsafe when both min<=0 and 0<=max, so min<=0 and max>=0.\n\nmin<=0 for t-2 <=17, i.e., t <=19\n\nmax>=0 for t-2 >=14, i.e., t >=16\n\nSo unsafe when t from 16 to 19 inclusive.\n\nt-2 from 14 to 17: t-2=14,15,16,17 → t=16,17,18,19\n\nt-2=14: t=16; t-2=15: t=17; t-2=16: t=18; t-2=17: t=19\n\nAnd min<=0 until t-2=17, t=19; max>=0 from t-2=14, t=16.\n\nSo unsafe at t=16,17,18,19.\n\nFor other times, safe on freeway 1.\n\nNow freeway 2: (-48, -59, right, 12) so τ=-59, h=-48, s=12\n\nmin(t) = τ + s(t-2) = -59 + 12(t-2)\n\nmax(t) = h + s(t-2) = -48 + 12(t-2)\n\nmin<=0: -59 +12(t-2) <=0 => 12(t-2) <=59 => t-2 <= 59/12 = 4.916, so t-2 <=4, t<=6\n\nmax>=0: -48 +12(t-2) >=0 => 12(t-2) >=48 => t-2 >=4, t>=6\n\nUnsafe when min<=0 and max>=0: t<=6 and t>=6, so only t=6.\n\nt-2 <=4 and t-2 >=4, so t-2=4, t=6.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as freeway 2, (-48,-59,right,12), so unsafe only at t=6.\n\nFreeway 4: same, unsafe at t=6.\n\nFreeway 5: same, unsafe at t=6.\n\nNow freeway 6: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (-48,-59,right,12) same as above, unsafe only at t=6.\n\nSecond car: (24,13,right,12) head=24, tail=13, s=12\n\nSpan at t=2: [13,24] since right-moving, [τ,h] with τ=13, h=24.\n\nmin(t) = τ + s(t-2) =13 +12(t-2)\n\nmax(t) =24 +12(t-2)\n\nNow, min(t) =13 +12(t-2) >0 for all t>=2, since min at t=2 is 13>0.\n\nmax(t) >0 always.\n\nBut min(t) >=13 >0, so 0 is never <= min(t), since min(t) >0, so 0 < min(t) <= something, so 0 not in [min(t), max(t)] because min(t) >0.\n\nThus, this car never has 0 in its span, so only the first car matters, unsafe only at t=6.\n\nBut at t=6, both cars might be present, but since we care if any car has 0 in span, at t=6, first car has 0 in span? For freeway 6 at t=6.\n\nFirst car: min(t) = -59 +12(t-2), at t=6, t-2=4, min= -59+48= -11 <=0, max= -48+48=0, so 0 <= max and min<=0, so 0 in [-11,0], yes.\n\nSecond car min=13+12(4)=13+48=61>0, so [61,72] or whatever, 0 not in, so only first car causes unsafe at t=6.\n\nSimilarly for other times.\n\nSo freeway 6 unsafe only at t=6.\n\nNow freeway 7: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (-36,-47,right,6) τ=-47? head=-36, tail=-47, so min=τ=-47, max=h=-36\n\ns=6\n\nmin(t) = -47 +6(t-2)\n\nmax(t) = -36 +6(t-2)\n\nmin<=0: -47 +6(t-2) <=0 => 6(t-2) <=47 => t-2 <= 47/6 ≈7.833, so t-2 <=7, t<=9\n\nmax>=0: -36 +6(t-2) >=0 => 6(t-2) >=36 => t-2 >=6, t>=8\n\nUnsafe when min<=0 and max>=0: t<=9 and t>=8, so t=8,9.\n\nt-2<=7 and t-2>=6, so t-2=6,7 → t=8,9\n\nSecond car: (12,1,right,6) τ=1? head=12, tail=1, min=τ=1, max=h=12\n\nmin(t) =1 +6(t-2)\n\nmax(t) =12 +6(t-2)\n\nmin(t) =1 +6(t-2) >=1 >0 for all t>=2, so min>0, thus 0 not in [min(t),max(t)] since min>0.\n\nSo this car never has 0 in span. Only first car matters.\n\nThus freeway 7 unsafe at t=8 and t=9.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8: same as freeway 7, since cars identical, unsafe at t=8 and t=9.\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway, unsafe times:\n\n- y=1: unsafe at t=16,17,18,19\n\n- y=2: unsafe at t=6\n\n- y=3: unsafe at t=6\n\n- y=4: unsafe at t=6\n\n- y=5: unsafe at t=6\n\n- y=6: unsafe at t=6\n\n- y=7: unsafe at t=8,9\n\n- y=8: unsafe at t=8,9\n\nAt t=6, y=2,3,4,5,6 are all unsafe? y=2 to y=6 all unsafe at t=6.\n\ny=2 unsafe at t=6, y=3 at t=6, etc.\n\nBut y=7 unsafe at t=8,9; y=8 at t=8,9.\n\ny=1 unsafe later.\n\nPlayer starts at t=2, y=2.\n\nAt t=2, y=2, is it unsafe? For y=2, unsafe at t=6, not at t=2.\n\nAt t=2, for freeway 2, min(t) = -59 +12(0) = -59 <=0, max= -48 <=0? max= -48 <0, so 0 <= max? 0 <= -48? False, since -48<0.\n\nmax(t) = -48 +12(t-2), at t=2, max=-48 <0, so 0 > max, thus 0 not <= max, so not unsafe. Similarly, min=-59<0, but 0 not <= max, so not in span.\n\nSimilarly, only at t=6, max=0, min=-11<0, so 0 in span.\n\nSo at t=2, y=2 is safe.\n\nNow, player at t=2, y=2, safe.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nTo minimize H, we want to reach y=9 as soon as possible, so we should move up when possible.\n\nBut we have to avoid being on a freeway when it is unsafe.\n\nAlso, we can stay or move down to wait.\n\nSince the unsafe times are only at specific times, we can plan around them.\n\nFirst, the earliest we can be at y=9: from y=2, need to increase by 7, so minimum 7 turns if we go up every turn.\n\nBut we might need to delay to avoid unsafe times.\n\nNow, the unsafe events: at t=6, y=2 to y=6 are unsafe, so we must not be on y=2,3,4,5,6 at t=6.\n\nSimilarly, at t=8 and 9, y=7 and y=8 are unsafe, so must not be on y=7 at t=8 or t=9, and not on y=8 at t=8 or t=9.\n\nAlso, at t=16-19, y=1 unsafe, but since we are going to y=9, and y=1 is low, probably not relevant if we go fast.\n\nBut let's see the path.\n\nPlayer starts at t=2, y=2.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nLet me denote the turn and position.\n\nt=2: y=2, safe.\n\nNow, we choose action a_t for t=2,3,4,... until we reach y=9.\n\nAfter action at turn t, we are at y_{t+1} at turn t+1.\n\nAt turn t, we are at y_t, choose a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + delta y_t.\n\nThen at turn t+1, we are at y_{t+1}, and so on.\n\nWe want y_T =9 for some T, with H actions from t=2 to t=2+H-1, so that after H actions, at turn 2+H, y=9.\n\nSet T = turn when we reach y=9.\n\nSo at turn T, y_T=9.\n\nThe actions are from t=2 to t=T-1, so H = T - 2 actions? Let's see.\n\nStart turn t=2, position y_2=2.\n\nAfter first action a_2, at turn t=3, position y_3 = y_2 + delta y_2\n\nAfter second action a_3, at turn t=4, y_4 = y_3 + delta y_3\n\n...\n\nAfter k actions, at turn t=2+k, position y_{2+k}\n\nWe want y_{2+k} =9 for some k.\n\nThen H = k, number of actions.\n\nTurn when we reach: t = 2 + H.\n\nAt that turn, we are on y=9, which is safe.\n\nNow, minimal H, so we want to reach as soon as possible.\n\nEarliest possible: if no cars, H=7, reach at turn 2+7=9, y_9=9.\n\nBut with cars, we need to check if we can do that.\n\nFrom t=2 to t=8, actions at t=2 to t=8, 7 actions, each U, y increases from 2 to 3,4,5,6,7,8,9 at turns 3,4,5,6,7,8,9.\n\ny_t at turn t:\n\nt=2: y=2\n\na_2=U: t=3, y=3\n\na_3=U: t=4, y=4\n\na_4=U: t=5, y=5\n\na_5=U: t=6, y=6\n\nAt t=6, y=6, which is freeway 6, and at t=6, freeway 6 is unsafe! Collision.\n\nSo cannot be on y=6 at t=6.\n\nSimilarly, if we were on y=5 at t=6, also unsafe, etc.\n\nIn this sequence, at t=6, y=6, unsafe.\n\nSo we need to avoid being on y=2,3,4,5,6 at t=6.\n\nSimilarly, later, at t=8 and t=9, y=7 and y=8 unsafe.\n\nBut let's first handle t=6 issue.\n\nt=6 is a problem for y=2 to 6.\n\nWe need to not be on those y at t=6.\n\nSince we start at t=2 y=2, we can delay our movement so that at t=6, we are not on y=2-6.\n\nFor example, we can stay at y=2 for some turns, or move down to y=1 or y=0, but y=0 is safe, no freeway.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe.\n\nSo we can go to y=0 to avoid.\n\nBut since we need to go up, going down might cost extra turns.\n\nWe can stay at some safe y until after t=6.\n\nFirst, where can we be at t=6 to be safe.\n\nAt t=6, y=1 is safe? y=1 unsafe at t=16-19, not at t=6, so at t=6, y=1 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=7: at t=6, freeway 7 unsafe at t=8,9, not at t=6.\n\nAt t=6, for y=7: min and max for cars.\n\nFreeway 7, first car min(t) = -47 +6(t-2), at t=6, t-2=4, min= -47+24= -23 <=0, max= -36+24= -12 <0, so max<0, 0 not <= max, so not unsafe. Second car min=1+24=25>0, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=8 same.\n\ny=9 safe.\n\ny=0 safe.\n\nSo at t=6, safe y are: y=0,1,7,8,9\n\ny=2,3,4,5,6 unsafe.\n\nNow, player starts at t=2, y=2.\n\nWe need to be at one of y=0,1,7,8,9 at t=6.\n\nThen from there, go to y=9.\n\nBut y=8 and 9 are high, might be hard to reach by t=6.\n\nFrom t=2 to t=6, there are 4 actions (t=2,3,4,5 actions) to go from y=2 to some y at t=6.\n\nAfter action at t=5, we are at y_6 at turn t=6.\n\nActions at t=2,3,4,5 determine y_3,y_4,y_5,y_6.\n\ny_6 is position at turn 6.\n\nWe need y_6 in {0,1,7,8,9}\n\nBut y=7,8,9 might be difficult to reach in 4 actions from y=2.\n\nMax we can go up: from y=2, 4 ups: y=3,4,5,6 at t=3,4,5,6. But at t=6, y=6 unsafe.\n\nIf we go up less, say 3 ups and one stay: y=2 to y=3,4,5, then stay at y=5 at t=6, but y=5 unsafe at t=6.\n\nSimilarly, y=4 or 3 or 2, all unsafe.\n\nIf we move down, to y=1 or 0.\n\nFor example, at t=2, stay: y=2 at t=3\n\nOr down: y=1 at t=3\n\nBut we need to be at safe y at t=6.\n\nPossible safe positions at t=6: y=0,1,7,8,9\n\nCan we reach y=7,8,9 by t=6?\n\nFrom y=2 at t=2, to y at t=6.\n\nEach action can increase y by at most 1, so in 4 actions, max y increase by 4, so y<= 2+4=6, so y=7,8,9 impossible to reach by t=6, since y=6 is max possible at t=6 with 4 ups, but y=6 unsafe.\n\ny=7 requires at least 5 ups, but only 4 actions, so impossible to be at y=7 or above at t=6.\n\nSimilarly, y=8 or 9 even higher.\n\nSo only possible safe positions at t=6 are y=0 or y=1.\n\ny=0 or y=1.\n\nNow, y=1: at t=6, is it safe? Yes, as we said, freeway 1 unsafe only at t=16-19.\n\ny=0: no freeway, safe.\n\nSo we must be at y=0 or y=1 at t=6.\n\nNow, to get to y=1 or 0 from y=2 in 4 actions (t=2 to t=5 actions).\n\nSince we can move down or stay.\n\nEasiest: move down to y=1 or 0.\n\nBut we need to go up later, so moving down costs extra.\n\nBut necessary to avoid t=6.\n\nNow, from y=2, we can go to y=1 quickly.\n\nFor example, at t=2, action D: down to y=1 at t=3.\n\nThen at t=3, we are at y=1.\n\nNow, we need to be at y=1 or 0 at t=6.\n\nIf we stay at y=1, or go to y=0.\n\nBut y=1 is safe at t=6, so we can stay.\n\nSimilarly, we could go to y=0.\n\nBut let's see the actions.\n\nWe have actions from t=2 to t=5 to set y_6.\n\ny_6 depends on actions from t=2 to t=5.\n\ny_2=2\n\na_2: y_3 = y_2 + delta a_2\n\na_3: y_4 = y_3 + delta a_3\n\na_4: y_5 = y_4 + delta a_4\n\na_5: y_6 = y_5 + delta a_5\n\nWe need y_6 = 0 or 1.\n\nSince y=1 is safe, we can aim for y=1 at t=6.\n\ny=1 at t=6 can be achieved by, for example, going to y=1 and staying.\n\nFrom y=2, we can go down to y=1 at t=3 with a_2=D.\n\nThen at t=3, y=1.\n\nThen we need to stay at y=1 or move, but to be at y=1 at t=6, we can stay from t=3 to t=6.\n\nActions: at t=3,4,5, if we do S,S,S, then y_4=1, y_5=1, y_6=1.\n\nWe could go to y=0, but not necessary.\n\ny=1 is fine.\n\nAfter t=6, we need to go to y=9.\n\nBut there is another problem at t=8 and 9 for y=7 and y=8.\n\nWe need to avoid being on y=7 at t=8 or t=9, and not on y=8 at t=8 or t=9.\n\nNow, after t=6, we are at y=1 or 0, say y=1 at t=6.\n\nThen we need to go up to y=9.\n\nFrom y=1 to y=9, need to increase by 8, so at least 8 actions if all up.\n\nBut we might need to delay for t=8,9 issue.\n\nFirst, let's get to t=6 safely.\n\nSo plan: to be at y=1 at t=6.\n\nOne way: at t=2: D, to y=1 at t=3\n\nThen t=3: S, to y=1 at t=4\n\nt=4: S, to y=1 at t=5\n\nt=5: S, to y=1 at t=6\n\nActions: a_2=D, a_3=S, a_4=S, a_5=S\n\nThen at t=6, y=1, safe.\n\nNow, from here, at t=6, y=1, we need to go up.\n\nBut at t=8 and t=9, y=7 and y=8 are unsafe.\n\nWe need to ensure that when we are on y=7, it is not at t=8 or t=9.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nSince we are at y=1 at t=6, we can start moving up.\n\nWe want to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nSuppose we go up as much as possible.\n\nEach up increases y by 1.\n\nFrom t=6, y=1.\n\nAction a_6 at t=6: if U, to y=2 at t=7\n\na_7: U, to y=3 at t=8\n\nAt t=8, y=3, which is safe? y=3 unsafe only at t=6, which is past, so safe.\n\nBut at t=8, we are at y=3.\n\nThen a_8: U, to y=4 at t=9\n\nt=9, y=4, safe.\n\na_9: U, to y=5 at t=10\n\na_10: U, to y=6 at t=11\n\na_11: U, to y=7 at t=12\n\na_12: U, to y=8 at t=13\n\na_13: U, to y=9 at t=14\n\nThen at t=14, y=9, reached.\n\nBut we have the issue at t=8 and t=9 with y=7 and y=8.\n\nIn this sequence, when are we on y=7?\n\nWe reach y=7 at t=12, which is after t=9, so t=12>9, and y=7 unsafe only at t=8,9, so at t=12, safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=8 at t=13, safe.\n\ny=9 at t=14, safe.\n\nBut is there a problem at earlier times?\n\nFor example, at t=8, we are at y=3, which is fine.\n\nt=9, y=4, fine.\n\nBut we used many turns, H= actions from t=6 to t=13, 8 actions? From t=6 to t=13, actions at t=6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13? No.\n\nAfter t=6, we are at y=1.\n\nAction a_6 at t=6: U, to y=2 at t=7\n\na_7 at t=7: U, to y=3 at t=8\n\na_8 at t=8: U, to y=4 at t=9\n\na_9 at t=9: U, to y=5 at t=10\n\na_10 at t=10: U, to y=6 at t=11\n\na_11 at t=11: U, to y=7 at t=12\n\na_12 at t=12: U, to y=8 at t=13\n\na_13 at t=13: U, to y=9 at t=14\n\nSo actions: 8 actions to go from y=1 to y=9, reaching at t=14.\n\nBut we have actions from t=2 to t=5 to get to t=6 y=1: that was 4 actions (D,S,S,S)\n\nSo total actions: from t=2 to t=13, that's t=2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13: 12 actions? Let's list all actions.\n\nStart t=2: position y=2\n\na_2: D, so at t=3, y=1\n\na_3: S, t=4, y=1\n\na_4: S, t=5, y=1\n\na_5: S, t=6, y=1\n\nNow a_6: U, t=7, y=2\n\na_7: U, t=8, y=3\n\na_8: U, t=9, y=4\n\na_9: U, t=10, y=5\n\na_10: U, t=11, y=6\n\na_11: U, t=12, y=7\n\na_12: U, t=13, y=8\n\na_13: U, t=14, y=9\n\nReached at t=14, with H=12 actions? Actions from t=2 to t=13, that's 12 actions.\n\nBut we can do better.\n\nSince at t=6 we are at y=1, and we need to go up, but we have to avoid being on y=7 at t=8 or t=9, or y=8 at t=8 or t=9.\n\nIn the above, we are on y=7 at t=12, which is late, no issue.\n\nBut we might be able to go faster.\n\nFrom y=1 at t=6, we can go up faster, but we need to pass y=7 and y=8 safely.\n\ny=7 is unsafe at t=8 and t=9, so we must not be on y=7 at t=8 or t=9.\n\nSimilarly, not on y=8 at t=8 or t=9.\n\nSo possible to be on y=7 only at t<8 or t>9.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nSince t=8 and 9 are close, we might stay below or above during that time.\n\nFor example, at t=6, y=1.\n\nIf we go up immediately, we might reach y=7 too early.\n\nLet's see the timeline.\n\nt=6: y=1\n\nIf a_6=U, t=7, y=2\n\na_7=U, t=8, y=3\n\nAt t=8, y=3, safe.\n\na_8=U, t=9, y=4\n\nt=9, y=4, safe.\n\nBut y=4 at t=9 is fine.\n\nThen continue up.\n\nBut to reach y=7, from y=1, need 6 steps: y=2,3,4,5,6,7.\n\nAt t=6 y=1, after 0 actions, y=1.\n\nAfter 1 action a_6, t=7, y=2\n\nAfter 2 actions, a_7, t=8, y=3\n\nAfter 3 actions, a_8, t=9, y=4\n\nAfter 4 actions, a_9, t=10, y=5\n\nAfter 5 actions, a_10, t=11, y=6\n\nAfter 6 actions, a_11, t=12, y=7\n\nAs before.\n\nWe can be on y=7 only from t=12 onwards, which is after t=9, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, no need to avoid t=8,9 for y=7 since we are not there yet.\n\nBut we could be on y=7 earlier if we go faster, but we can't, since min steps.\n\nAnother idea: since at t=6 we are at y=1, but we could be at y=0 instead, but not better.\n\nOr, we might not need to stay at y=1 for so long before t=6.\n\nIn the initial part, to reach safe at t=6, we only need to be at y=0 or 1 at t=6.\n\nWe can reach faster.\n\nFor example, from t=2 y=2:\n\na_2: D, to y=1 at t=3\n\nThen we can start going up earlier, but we need to not be on y=2-6 at t=6.\n\nAt t=6, we must be y<=1 or y>=7, but y>=7 impossible, so y<=1.\n\nSo at t=6, y must be 0 or 1.\n\nIf at t=3, y=1, we can choose to go up, but if we go up, say a_3=U, to y=2 at t=4\n\nThen at t=4, y=2\n\nIf we continue up, a_4=U, to y=3 at t=5\n\na_5=U, to y=4 at t=6, but y=4 at t=6 unsafe.\n\nIf we stay or down, but we need to be low at t=6.\n\nSo if we go to y=2 at t=4, we can then go down or stay to be at y<=1 at t=6.\n\nBut that might cost more actions.\n\nFor example:\n\nt=2: y=2, a_2=D, t=3 y=1\n\nThen if a_3=U, t=4 y=2\n\nThen a_4=D, t=5 y=1\n\na_5=S, t=6 y=1\n\nBut this has extra down and up, worse than staying.\n\nBetter to stay at y=1 after reaching.\n\nSo the first plan is fine: stay at y=1 from t=3 to t=6 with actions D,S,S,S for t=2,3,4,5.\n\na_2=D, a_3=S, a_4=S, a_5=S, to y=1 at t=6.\n\nNow, from there, to reach y=9 faster, but we have to go through y=7 and y=8, which have unsafe times at t=8,9.\n\nIn the slow path, we reach y=7 at t=12, which is after t=9, so safe.\n\nBut perhaps we can reach earlier by not staying so long at y=1.\n\nAt t=6, y=1, we can go up immediately.\n\nThe unsafe times for y=7 are t=8 and t=9.\n\nSo if we can be on y=7 at t=7 or t=10 or later, safe.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nt=7: at t=7, y=7 is safe? Freeway 7 unsafe only at t=8,9, so at t=7, it is safe.\n\nSimilarly, t=10 safe, etc.\n\nSo we can be on y=7 at t=7, or t=10,11,etc.\n\nBut not at t=8,9.\n\nSimilarly, for y=8, unsafe at t=8,9, so can be at t=7,10,etc.\n\nNow, from t=6 y=1, if we go up fast:\n\na_6: U, t=7 y=2\n\na_7: U, t=8 y=3\n\nAt t=8, y=3\n\nBut we want to be on y=7 soon.\n\nTo be on y=7 at t=7: at t=7, y=7.\n\nBut from t=6 y=1, to y=7 at t=7, impossible, since one action can only increase by 1, to y=2 at t=7.\n\nMax at t=7 is y=2 if a_6=U.\n\ny=7 at t=7 not possible from y=1 at t=6.\n\nSimilarly, to be on y=7 at t=10: for example.\n\nt=10 is later.\n\nBut let's see the earliest we can reach y=9.\n\nFrom y=1 at t=6, need 8 ups to y=9 at t=14, as before.\n\nBut if we can be on y=7 at t=10, for example.\n\nt=10 is turn.\n\nPosition at turn t.\n\nAt t=6, y=1\n\nAfter k actions, at turn t=6+k, y = 1 + number of ups minus downs.\n\nTo minimize time, we should not move down, only up or stay.\n\nEach stay costs a turn without progress.\n\nSo to reach y=9 from y=1, we need at least 8 up actions, and possibly some stays, but stays increase time without progress, so minimal time is with all up actions, no stay or down.\n\nWith 8 up actions: start t=6 y=1\n\na_6: U, t=7 y=2\n\na_7: U, t=8 y=3\n\na_8: U, t=9 y=4\n\na_9: U, t=10 y=5\n\na_10: U, t=11 y=6\n\na_11: U, t=12 y=7\n\na_12: U, t=13 y=8\n\na_13: U, t=14 y=9\n\nReach at t=14.\n\nIn this, at t=12, y=7, which is after t=9, safe.\n\nSimilarly, t=13 y=8, after t=9, safe.\n\nBut we have the actions from t=2 to t=5 to get to t=6 y=1.\n\nIn that part, we used 4 actions but only one was down, and three stays, but we could reduce the stays.\n\nTo get to y=1 at t=6 from y=2 at t=2.\n\nWe need to be at y<=1 at t=6.\n\nAt t=2, y=2.\n\nWe can go to y=1 earlier and then stay, or go to y=0.\n\nBut going down to y=0 might not help.\n\nSince we need to be low at t=6, we can move down directly.\n\nFor example, at t=2: D, to y=1 at t=3\n\nThen we can immediately start going up, but we must ensure that at t=6, we are not on y=2-6.\n\nSo if at t=3, y=1, we go up: a_3=U, to y=2 at t=4\n\nThen at t=4, y=2\n\nNow, at t=6, we need y=0 or 1.\n\nFrom y=2 at t=4, to t=6 in two actions: a_4 and a_5.\n\nIf a_4=D, to y=1 at t=5\n\na_5=S, to y=1 at t=6\n\nThen y=1 at t=6.\n\nActions: a_2=D, a_3=U, a_4=D, a_5=S\n\nCompared to previous a_2=D, a_3=S, a_4=S, a_5=S, this has an extra U and D, so two more actions? No.\n\nPrevious: a_2=D, a_3=S, a_4=S, a_5=S → 4 actions to y=1 at t=6\n\nThis: a_2=D (t=3 y=1), a_3=U (t=4 y=2), a_4=D (t=5 y=1), a_5=S (t=6 y=1) → still 4 actions, but we have a down and up that cancel, so net no progress, same as staying.\n\nBut in terms of time, same.\n\nThen from t=6 y=1, same as before.\n\nBut in this case, at t=4, y=2, which is safe? At t=4, y=2.\n\nIs y=2 safe at t=4? Freeway 2 unsafe only at t=6, so at t=4, safe.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nBut we don't save time.\n\nWe could go to y=0.\n\nFor example, a_2=D, to y=1 t=3\n\na_3=D, to y=0 t=4\n\nThen at t=4, y=0\n\nThen we can stay or go up.\n\nBut at t=6, we need to be at y=0 or 1.\n\nIf we stay at y=0, a_4=S, t=5 y=0, a_5=S, t=6 y=0, safe.\n\nBut then from y=0 at t=6, to y=9, need 9 ups, reach at t=15, worse.\n\nIf we go up from y=0.\n\nBut still, more steps.\n\nSo better to be at y=1 at t=6.\n\nNow, back to the later part.\n\nIn the sequence from t=6 y=1 to t=14 y=9, we use 8 actions, but we might pass y=7 and y=8 faster if we can be there at safe times.\n\nFor example, if we can be on y=7 at t=7, but impossible from y=1 at t=6.\n\nt=7: from t=6 y=1, after one action, y<=2.\n\nt=10: at t=10, y=7 possible.\n\nHow?\n\nFrom t=6 y=1:\n\nIf we do all up, at t=7 y=2, t=8 y=3, t=9 y=4, t=10 y=5, etc, not y=7 at t=10.\n\nTo be at y=7 at t=10, we need to have increased by 6 from t=6 to t=10.\n\nFrom turn t=6 to turn t=10, there are 4 actions: a_6,a_7,a_8,a_9 determining y_7,y_8,y_9,y_10.\n\ny_10 = y_6 + sum delta from t=6 to t=9 actions.\n\ny_6=1\n\nAfter a_6, y_7 = y_6 + delta a_6\n\nAfter a_7, y_8 = y_7 + delta a_7\n\nAfter a_8, y_9 = y_8 + delta a_8\n\nAfter a_9, y_10 = y_9 + delta a_9\n\nWe want y_10 =7.\n\nSo y_10 =1 + number of U minus number of D from t=6 to t=9 actions.\n\nSince we can only U or S or D, but D is bad, so we should use U and S.\n\nTo reach y=7 at t=10, we need net +6 increase from y=1.\n\nBut in 4 actions, max increase is +4, to y=5, cannot reach y=7.\n\ny_10 at turn 10, after actions a_6 to a_9.\n\ny_6=1 at t=6\n\na_6: y_7 at t=7\n\na_7: y_8 at t=8\n\na_8: y_9 at t=9\n\na_9: y_10 at t=10\n\nTo have y_10=7, since y_10 = y_9 + delta a_9, so y_9 must be 6 or 7, etc.\n\nBut from y_6=1 to y_10=7, that's +6 in 4 steps, so average 1.5 per step, but since integer, not possible with max +1 per step. Min steps to +6 is 6 actions, so with 4 actions, max y=5 at t=10.\n\nSimilarly, cannot reach y=7 before t=12 with all up.\n\nt=12 is the earliest for y=7 from y=1 at t=6.\n\nSimilarly for y=9 at t=14.\n\nBut we have the unsafe times at t=8,9 for y=7 and y=8.\n\nIn the path, we are not on y=7 or 8 until t=12 and t=13, after t=9, so no problem.\n\nBut is there a way to reach y=9 earlier?\n\nPerhaps by not going to y=1 at t=6, but since we have to be low at t=6, no choice.\n\nAnother idea: maybe we can be on y=7 at a safe time, like t=7 or t=10.\n\nt=7: from t=6 y=1, cannot.\n\nt=10: as above, with 4 actions from t=6 to t=9, y_10 <=1+4=5 <7, impossible.\n\nSo we cannot be on y=7 at t=10 or earlier except t=12 or later.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nBut there is y=1 unsafe at t=16-19, but we will be long gone, at y=9 by t=14.\n\nt=14 <16, so no problem.\n\nSo in this plan, we reach at t=14.\n\nBut can we reduce H?\n\nTotal actions: from t=2 to t=13, 12 actions? Let's count the turns.\n\nStart turn t=2, after H actions, at turn t=2+H, y=9.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nAfter a_2 to a_13, at t=14, y=9.\n\na_2 to a_13 is 12 actions? t=2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13: that's 12 actions.\n\nH=12.\n\nBut we might be able to start going up earlier after t=6.\n\nIn the first part, to reach y=1 at t=6, we used actions that kept us at y=1 from t=3 to t=6.\n\nBut at t=3, y=1, we could go up to y=2, but then we need to come back down for t=6.\n\nFor example:\n\nt=2: y=2, a_2=D, t=3 y=1\n\nt=3: a_3=U, t=4 y=2\n\nt=4: a_4=S, t=5 y=2  // or something\n\nBut at t=6, need y<=1, so from t=4 y=2, we need a_4 and a_5 to get to y<=1.\n\na_4=D, t=5 y=1, then a_5=S, t=6 y=1.\n\nOr a_4=S, t=5 y=2, then a_5=D, t=6 y=1.\n\nIn both cases, we have an extra move, but same number of actions to reach t=6 y=1.\n\nNo saving.\n\nWe could go to y=0 at some point, but not helpful.\n\nSo H=12 seems necessary with this.\n\nBut let's see if we can reach y=9 faster by not staying at y=1 so long.\n\nSuppose at t=2, we do not move down immediately.\n\nFor example, at t=2, y=2, safe, a_2=S, to y=2 at t=3\n\nt=3, y=2, safe (since unsafe only at t=6), a_3=S, to y=2 at t=4\n\nt=4, y=2, safe, a_4=S, to y=2 at t=5\n\nNow at t=5, y=2, we need to not be on y=2 at t=6, but at t=5, we choose a_5.\n\nIf a_5=S, then at t=6 y=2, unsafe.\n\nIf a_5=D, to y=1 at t=6, safe.\n\nThen at t=6, y=1.\n\nThen from here, same as before, go up to y=9 in 8 actions, reach t=14.\n\nBut in this case, actions: a_2=S, a_3=S, a_4=S, a_5=D, then a_6 to a_13 U each, to t=14 y=9.\n\nNumber of actions: from t=2 to t=13, 12 actions same as before.\n\nBut we stayed at y=2 for three turns, then down to y=1 at t=6.\n\nCompared to first plan where we went to y=1 at t=3 and stayed.\n\nSame number of actions.\n\nIn terms of reaching y=9, same turn.\n\nBut in first plan, we were at y=1 earlier, but we didn't progress.\n\nNo difference.\n\nNow, to reduce H, we need to reach y=9 earlier.\n\nBut from y=2 at t=2, to y=9, minimum 7 actions if no delays, but we have to avoid t=6.\n\nSince t=6 is the only critical point early on, and we have to spend time at low y.\n\nAnother idea: can we be on y=7 or 8 at t=6? But impossible, as y<=6 at t=6.\n\nNo.\n\nPerhaps we can go down to y=0, but that makes it worse.\n\nOr, since y=9 is safe, we can reach it directly if we can avoid the unsafe freeways.\n\nBut we have to go through them.\n\nUnless we can time it so that when we are on y=7, it is not t=8 or 9.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nBut from start, if we go up slowly.\n\nFor example, at t=2 y=2, a_2=S, t=3 y=2\n\na_3=S, t=4 y=2\n\na_4=S, t=5 y=2\n\na_5=D, t=6 y=1  // to avoid t=6\n\nThen from t=6 y=1, we need to go up.\n\nBut now, to avoid y=7 at t=8 and t=9.\n\nAt t=6 y=1, if we go up: a_6=U, t=7 y=2\n\na_7=U, t=8 y=3\n\nAt t=8, y=3, safe.\n\na_8=U, t=9 y=4\n\nt=9, y=4, safe.\n\nThen a_9=U, t=10 y=5\n\na_10=U, t=11 y=6\n\na_11=U, t=12 y=7\n\na_12=U, t=13 y=8\n\na_13=U, t=14 y=9\n\nSame as before.\n\nIf we want to be on y=7 at t=10, but from above, at t=10 y=5, not 7.\n\nCan we reach y=7 faster from here? No.\n\nSuppose at t=6 y=1, we do multiple ups, but still.\n\nPerhaps we can stay at some y to delay.\n\nFor example, to avoid being on y=7 at t=8,9, we can be on lower y at that time.\n\nAt t=8 and t=9, we should not be on y=7 or y=8.\n\nOther y are safe at those times.\n\nFor example, at t=8, y=1,2,3,4,5,6,9 are safe, only y=7 and 8 unsafe.\n\nSimilarly at t=9.\n\nIn the sequence, at t=8, we can be on y=3, which is fine.\n\nBut to reach y=9 faster, we need to go up.\n\nSuppose from t=6 y=1, we go up but pause around t=8,9.\n\nBut pausing will make us slower.\n\nFor example:\n\nt=6 y=1, a_6=U, t=7 y=2\n\nt=7 y=2, a_7=U, t=8 y=3\n\nt=8 y=3, a_8=U, t=9 y=4\n\nt=9 y=4, a_9=U, t=10 y=5\n\netc, same as before.\n\nIf at t=7 y=2, we do a_7=S, t=8 y=2\n\nThen at t=8, y=2, safe.\n\na_8=U, t=9 y=3\n\nt=9 y=3, safe.\n\na_9=U, t=10 y=4\n\nThen continue, but now at t=10 y=4, whereas previously we were at y=4 at t=9, so we are one step behind, worse.\n\nSo no benefit.\n\nThus, the fastest way is to go directly up after t=6, reaching y=9 at t=14 with H=12 actions.\n\nBut let's confirm the actions.\n\nActions from t=2 to t=13:\n\nt=2: D  (to y=1 at t=3)\n\nt=3: S  (y=1 at t=4)\n\nt=4: S  (y=1 at t=5)\n\nt=5: S  (y=1 at t=6)\n\nt=6: U  (y=2 at t=7)\n\nt=7: U  (y=3 at t=8)\n\nt=8: U  (y=4 at t=9)\n\nt=9: U  (y=5 at t=10)\n\nt=10: U  (y=6 at t=11)\n\nt=11: U  (y=7 at t=12)\n\nt=12: U  (y=8 at t=13)\n\nt=13: U  (y=9 at t=14)\n\nAt each turn, check collision.\n\nt=2: y=2, freeway 2, at t=2: min=-59<0, max=-48<0, 0 not <= max, so safe.\n\nt=3: y=1, freeway 1, at t=3: min(t) for y=1 car: min(t)= -53 +3(t-2), t=3, t-2=1, min=-53+3=-50<0, max=-42+3=-39<0, 0 not <= max, safe.\n\nt=4: y=1, same as above, t=4, t-2=2, min=-53+6=-47<0, max=-42+6=-36<0, safe.\n\nt=5: y=1, t=5, t-2=3, min=-53+9=-44<0, max=-42+9=-33<0, safe.\n\nt=6: y=1, t=6, t-2=4, min=-53+12=-41<0, max=-42+12=-30<0, safe. (since unsafe only at t=16-19)\n\nt=7: y=2, freeway 2, t=7, min(t)= -59 +12(t-2), t-2=5, min=-59+60=1>0? min=1, max= -48+60=12>0, so min=1>0, 0 not <= min, so not in span, safe. (only unsafe at t=6)\n\nt=8: y=3, freeway 3, t=8, similarly, min and max: for y=3 car, same as y=2, min(t)= -59+12(t-2), t-2=6, min=-59+72=13>0, max= -48+72=24>0, so min>0, safe.\n\nt=9: y=4, freeway 4, t=9, t-2=7, min=-59+84=25>0, safe.\n\nt=10: y=5, freeway 5, t=10, t-2=8, min=-59+96=37>0, safe.\n\nt=11: y=6, freeway 6, at t=11, t-2=9, min for first car: -59+12*9= -59+108=49>0, max= -48+108=60>0, safe. Second car also min>0.\n\nt=12: y=7, freeway 7, t=12, t-2=10, for first car min(t)= -47 +6(t-2)= -47+60=13>0, max=-36+60=24>0, safe. (unsafe only at t=8,9)\n\nt=13: y=8, freeway 8, similarly, min and max positive, safe.\n\nt=14: y=9, safe, no freeway.\n\nSo all safe.\n\nNow, is there a way with fewer actions?\n\nSuppose we don't go down to y=1, but to y=0.\n\nBut y=0 to y=9 needs 9 ups, worse.\n\nOr, we can be at y=1 at t=6 with fewer actions, but we need to be there at t=6, and from y=2, with actions, we can only get to y=1 or 0 at t=6 with at least one down or stay, but minimal actions to be safe at t=6 is to go down once and stay, but with 4 actions, it's fixed.\n\nPerhaps we can reach y=9 before t=14.\n\nFor example, if we can be at higher y at t=6, but impossible.\n\nAnother idea: since at t=6, y=2-6 unsafe, but at other times safe, we can be on y=6 at t=5 or t=7, for example.\n\nAt t=5, y=6 is safe? Freeway 6 unsafe only at t=6, so at t=5, safe.\n\nSimilarly, t=7 safe.\n\nSo if we can be on y=6 at t=5, then at t=6, we need to not be on y=6, so move away.\n\nFor example, start at t=2 y=2.\n\nGo up fast: a_2=U, t=3 y=3\n\na_3=U, t=4 y=4\n\na_4=U, t=5 y=5\n\nAt t=5, y=5, safe.\n\nNow, at t=5, we choose a_5.\n\nIf a_5=U, to y=6 at t=6, but at t=6, y=6 unsafe! Collision.\n\nIf a_5=D, to y=4 at t=6, but y=4 at t=6 unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, if a_5=S, to y=5 at t=6, unsafe.\n\nSo from y=5 at t=5, any action leads to y=4,5, or 6 at t=6, all unsafe.\n\nIf we are at y=6 at t=5.\n\na_2=U, t=3 y=3\n\na_3=U, t=4 y=4\n\na_4=U, t=5 y=5\n\nTo be at y=6 at t=5, we need three ups from t=2, but from t=2 to t=5: actions a_2,a_3,a_4 for y_3,y_4,y_5.\n\ny_5 at t=5.\n\ny_2=2\n\na_2: y_3\n\na_3: y_4\n\na_4: y_5\n\nWith three actions, max y_5 = 2+3=5, since each U increases by 1, so y=5 at t=5 is max, cannot be y=6 at t=5.\n\ny=6 not possible at t=5.\n\nSimilarly, cannot be on safe high y at t=6.\n\nSo must be at low y at t=6.\n\nThus, minimal H is 12.\n\nBut let's see if we can reduce by one.\n\nSuppose we go to y=1 at t=3, then at t=3, y=1, instead of staying, we go up to y=2 at t=4, then down to y=1 at t=5, then to y=1 at t=6, but same as before.\n\nAt t=6 y=1, we go up, but if we can reach y=9 with one less action, but from y=1 to y=9, min 8 actions.\n\nUnless we can start from higher.\n\nAnother thought: at t=2, y=2, we can go up to y=3 at t=3, but then we need to get down for t=6.\n\nFor example:\n\nt=2: U, to y=3 at t=3\n\nt=3: U, to y=4 at t=4\n\nt=4: U, to y=5 at t=5\n\nNow at t=5, y=5, safe.\n\nThen we need to go to safe y at t=6, but from y=5, if we go down to y=4, unsafe at t=6, to y=5 unsafe, to y=6 unsafe.\n\nOnly if we could go to y=7, but cannot in one action.\n\na_5=U, to y=6 at t=6, unsafe.\n\na_5=D, to y=4 at t=6, unsafe.\n\nNo, so we must not be at y=4 or 5 at t=5 if we want to go down further, but at t=5, y=4 or 5 is safe, but we cannot escape the unsafe y at t=6 from there.\n\nFor example, from y=5 at t=5, we can only go to y=4,5,6 at t=6, all unsafe.\n\nSimilarly from y=4 at t=5, go to y=3,4,5 at t=6, unsafe.\n\nOnly from y=3 at t=5, go to y=2,3,4 at t=6, unsafe.\n\nFrom y=2 at t=5, go to y=1,2,3 at t=6; y=1 safe, y=2 and 3 unsafe.\n\nSo if at t=5, we are at y=2, we can do a_5=D, to y=1 at t=6.\n\nBut to be at y=2 at t=5.\n\nFrom start: t=2 y=2\n\na_2=S, to y=2 at t=3\n\na_3=S, to y=2 at t=4\n\na_4=S, to y=2 at t=5\n\nThen a_5=D, to y=1 at t=6\n\nThen same as before.\n\na_2=U, to y=3 at t=3\n\na_3=D, to y=2 at t=4? Let's see.\n\nt=2: U, t=3 y=3\n\nt=3: D, t=4 y=2\n\nt=4: S, t=5 y=2\n\nThen a_5=D, t=6 y=1\n\nStill, to reach y=2 at t=5, we used actions, but we are at y=2 at t=5, which is lower than the first up sequence.\n\nIn terms of progress, we are at y=2 at t=5, whereas in the down early, we were at y=1 at t=3, but stayed.\n\nBut at t=5, in down early: y=1, in this: y=2, so higher.\n\nThen from t=6 y=1 in both cases.\n\nIn this sequence: actions\n\nt=2: U (to y=3 t=3)\n\nt=3: D (to y=2 t=4)  // down\n\nt=4: S (to y=2 t=5)\n\nt=5: D (to y=1 t=6)\n\nThen from t=6 y=1, same up sequence to y=9 at t=14.\n\nBut now we have an extra down at t=3, so we wasted an up and down.\n\nCompared to first plan where we had a_2=D, then S,S,S to y=1 at t=6.\n\nHere we have U and D, so net zero, same as staying, but with more actions? No, same number: a_2 to a_5: four actions, to y=1 at t=6.\n\nBut in first plan, a_2=D, a_3=S, a_4=S, a_5=S: y from 2 to1 to1 to1 to1.\n\nHere a_2=U (y to3), a_3=D (y to2), a_4=S (y=2), a_5=D (y to1): so at t=6 y=1, same.\n\nBut we used U and D, which cancel, so no better.\n\nThus, no improvement.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 12, with the sequence as above.\n\nBut in the sequence, we can output the actions.\n\nNow, for the later unsafe times, we didn't have issue, but in this case, we reached after.\n\nPerhaps we can be on y=8 at t=7, but impossible.\n\nI think H=12 is minimal.\n\nBut let's confirm the answer format.\n\nThe actions are for turns starting from t1=2.\n\nSo sequence:\n\nTurn 2: D\n\nTurn 3: S\n\nTurn 4: S\n\nTurn 5: S\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nAnd we reach at turn 14, y=9.\n\nH=12 actions.\n\nBut in the sequence, from turn 6 to 13, we have U each, but turn 13: U to y=9 at turn 14.\n\nIn the action list, turn 13 is included.\n\nIn the answer, it should be a sequence of actions from turn t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nt1=2, H=12, so actions for turn 2 to 13.\n\nNow, but in the beginning, at turn 2, we did D, which is down to y=1.\n\nIs there a way to not move down? Only if we can be at y=0 at t=6, but y=0 requires going down, same cost.\n\nPerhaps stay at y=2 until later, but we have to go down at some point.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nSo the minimal H is 12.\n\nBut let's see if we can reach in 11 actions.\n\nSuppose at t=2, we do nothing, but then we need to be low at t=6.\n\nSuppose we go to y=1 at t=3, then at t=3, instead of staying, we go up to y=2 at t=4, but then we need to be at y=1 at t=6, so we go down at t=5.\n\nBut we can go directly to y=9 from there, but from y=1 at t=6, min to y=9 is 8 actions, so at least turn 14.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nIf we are at y=2 at t=6, but unsafe, cannot.\n\nSo impossible with H=11.\n\nThus H=12 is minimal.\n\nNow for the output.\n\nThe sequence of actions:\n\nTurn 2: D\n\nTurn 3: S\n\nTurn 4: S\n\nTurn 5: S\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nIn the sequence, turn 12: U to y=8 at turn 13? Let's list positions:\n\nt=2: y=2, action a_2=D\n\nt=3: y=1, action a_3=S\n\nt=4: y=1, action a_4=S\n\nt=5: y=1, action a_5=S\n\nt=6: y=1, action a_6=U\n\nt=7: y=2, action a_7=U\n\nt=8: y=3, action a_8=U\n\nt=9: y=4, action a_9=U\n\nt=10: y=5, action a_10=U\n\nt=11: y=6, action a_11=U\n\nt=12: y=7, action a_12=U\n\nt=13: y=8, action a_13=U\n\nt=14: y=9\n\nYes.\n\nNow, in the action for turn 13: U, which is from y=8 to y=9.\n\nAnd turn 13 is included in the sequence.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be listed.\n\nBut in the sequence, we have S actions which are stays, but necessary.\n\nPerhaps we can reduce the stays.\n\nFor example, at turn 3,4,5, instead of S, we could do something else, but if we do U, we go to y=2 at t=4, then we need to come back, costing more.\n\nNo.\n\nSo this should be fine.\n\nTherefore, the minimal number of turns H is 12, with the sequence above.\n\nNow for the output.\n</think>\nTo reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 2) at turn \\(t_1 = 2\\) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the player must follow a specific sequence of actions. The unsafe times for each freeway, derived from the car states and update rules, are as follows:\n\n- Freeway 1 is unsafe at turns 16, 17, 18, 19.\n- Freeways 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are unsafe at turn 6.\n- Freeways 7 and 8 are unsafe at turns 8 and 9.\n\nThe player starts at \\(y = 2\\) at turn 2, which is safe. To avoid being on freeways 2–6 at turn 6 (when they are unsafe), the player must be at \\(y = 0\\) or \\(y = 1\\) at turn 6. Since \\(y = 1\\) is safe at turn 6 and closer to the goal \\(y = 9\\), it is preferable. The player moves down to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 3 and stays there until turn 6 to ensure safety.\n\nAfter turn 6, the player moves up consistently to reach \\(y = 9\\) as quickly as possible. Freeways 7 and 8 are unsafe at turns 8 and 9, but since the player reaches \\(y = 7\\) at turn 12 and \\(y = 8\\) at turn 13 (both after turn 9), there is no collision risk. The player reaches \\(y = 9\\) at turn 14 after 12 actions.\n\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 12, with the following sequence of actions:\n\n- Turn 2: Move down (D) to reach \\(y = 1\\) at turn 3.\n- Turns 3, 4, 5: Stay (S) to remain at \\(y = 1\\) for turns 4, 5, and 6 (safe at turn 6).\n- Turns 6 to 13: Move up (U) each turn to increase \\(y\\) by 1 per turn, reaching \\(y = 9\\) at turn 14.\n\nThis sequence ensures no collisions and minimizes \\(H\\).\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 2: & D \\\\ \\text{Turn } 3: & S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 4: & S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 5: & S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: & U \\\\ \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to get the player from (0,3) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t_1 = 4, but since we're starting from this point, I should think of this as time zero for simplicity. I'll set t=0 for turn t_1=4 to make calculations easier. So, at t=0, player is at y=3.\n\nThe player moves each turn with actions U (up, y increases by 1), D (down, y decreases by 1), or S (stay, y unchanged), but y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars are on freeways y=1 to y=8, each with given positions and speeds. Cars move left or right, and I need to avoid being on a row when a car spans x=0 at that turn.\n\nCollision happens at turn T only if for the row y_T, there is a car where 0 is in its span at that turn. And importantly, if I move to a new row at turn T, I'm not on that new row until the next turn. So at turn T, I am on row y_T, and I might move to y_{T+1} for the next turn.\n\nFrom the note: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nBut the collision is checked based on where I am at turn T. At turn T, I am on row y_T, and I check if for that row, at turn T, there is a car with 0 in its span.\n\nWhen I take an action at turn T, it determines y_{T+1}. So at turn T, I am at position y_T, and I choose action a_T which sets y_{T+1}.\n\nThen, for collision at turn T: I am at y_T, and I need that for row y_T, at time T (global time), no car on that row has 0 in its span.\n\nSimilarly for future turns.\n\nNow, the global time starts from t_1=4. But for simplicity, I'll define τ = t - t_1, so at τ=0, global time is 4, player at y=3.\n\nI need to find actions from τ=0 to τ=H-1, such that at τ=H-1, y=9.\n\nMinimal H.\n\nFirst, list all the cars and their movements.\n\nCars are per freeway row.\n\nFor each row k from 1 to 8, there are cars listed.\n\nLet's list them with their initial positions at global time t=4 (τ=0).\n\nFreeway 1: one car: head h=-36, tail τ=-47? That can't be right. Tail should be less than head if moving right? No.\n\nDirection: right. For right-moving cars, head is to the right, tail to the left, so tail < head.\n\nHere, for row 1: (-36, -47, right, 3). But -36 > -47, so if tail is -47 and head is -36, and moving right, that means at time t, span is [tail, head] = [-47, -36]? But it says \"head h, tail τ\", and for right-moving, span is [τ, h]? Let's see the car update.\n\nFrom the update rule:\n\nFor left-moving: span(t) = [h, τ] → at T, [h - s(T-t), τ - s(T-t)]\n\nFor right-moving: span(t) = [τ, h] → at T, [τ + s(T-t), h + s(T-t)]\n\nIn the table, it's given as (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\n\nBut for right-moving, head h is the right end, tail τ is the left end, so span is [τ, h].\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, if head is left end, tail is right end? The notation is inconsistent.\n\nLook at the update rule:\n\nLeft-moving: \"Span(t) = [h, τ]\" and it moves left, so h decreases, etc.\n\nIn the example for row 6: (48, 37, right, 12), head=48, tail=37? But 48>37, so if moving right, head should be larger, tail smaller, so span [τ, h] = [37,48].\n\nSimilarly, for row 7: (24,13,right,6), head=24, tail=13, so [13,24].\n\nBut for row 1: (-36, -47, right,3). -36 > -47, so tail τ=-47, head h=-36, so span [-47, -36] at t=4.\n\nSince moving right, at time T, span is [τ + s(T-4), h + s(T-4)] = [-47 + 3(T-4), -36 + 3(T-4)]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, for left-moving, but in this case, all cars seem to be right-moving? Let's check.\n\nRow 1: direction right\n\nRow 2: right\n\nRow 3: right\n\nRow 4: right\n\nRow 5: right\n\nRow 6: two cars: first (-24,-35,right,12) and second (48,37,right,12)\n\n(48,37,right,12) — head=48, tail=37? 48>37, so if right, span [37,48]\n\nBut in the list it's written as (head, tail), so for (48,37), head=48, tail=37, so since right, tail=37, head=48.\n\nSimilarly, (-24,-35,right,12), head=-24, tail=-35? tail=-35, head=-24, so span [-35,-24] at t=4.\n\n-35 < -24, so [-35,-24].\n\nMoving right, so at T, [ -35 +12(T-4), -24 +12(T-4) ]\n\nSimilarly, row 7: two cars: (-24,-35,right,6) and (24,13,right,6)\n\nFirst car: head=-24, tail=-35? tail=-35, head=-24, span [-35,-24] at t=4, speed 6, so at T, [ -35 +6(T-4), -24 +6(T-4) ]\n\nSecond car: (24,13,right,6), head=24, tail=13, span [13,24] at t=4, at T, [13+6(T-4), 24+6(T-4)]\n\nRow 8: similar to row 7: (-24,-35,right,6) and (24,13,right,6)\n\nNow, for row 6, it has two cars: one with (-24,-35,right,12) and (48,37,right,12)\n\n(48,37): head=48, tail=37, so span [37,48] at t=4.\n\nBut 37 to 48, and moving right at speed 12.\n\nSimilarly, the other is [-35,-24] at t=4.\n\nNow, I need to find when 0 is in the span for each row at different times.\n\nSince the player is moving vertically, and cars horizontally, collision only when player is on that row at the same time.\n\nFor each row k, and for each car on that row, I need to know when 0 is covered by that car at time T.\n\nThen, for row k, at time T, if 0 is covered by any car on that row, it's occupied, so player cannot be on row k at time T.\n\nOtherwise, it's safe.\n\nThen, the player starts at y=3 at τ=0 (t=4), and needs to reach y=9 at some τ=H-1.\n\nActions: U, D, S, changing y by +1, -1, 0.\n\nMin H.\n\nSince we want to go from y=3 to y=9, that's +6 in y, so minimum moves would be 6 Ups, but we might need to wait or detour to avoid collisions, so H >=6.\n\nBut with waits, H could be more.\n\nFirst, I should compute for each row, the times when it is occupied, i.e., when 0 is covered by a car.\n\nDefine time from τ=0, global t = 4 + τ.\n\nFor a given row k, at time τ (global t=4+τ), is row k occupied?\n\nOccupied if for some car on row k, 0 is in the span at time t=4+τ.\n\nNow, for each car, the span at time t=4+τ.\n\nSince the cars move linearly, I can find the time intervals when 0 is covered.\n\nBut since multiple cars per row, I need the union of intervals when any car covers 0.\n\nThen, row is occupied during those times, and safe otherwise.\n\nPlayer must not be on a row when it is occupied at that time.\n\nNow, for row k, at time τ, if player is on row k, it must be that row k is safe at τ.\n\nLet's compute for each row.\n\nStart with row 1.\n\nRow 1: one car: at t=4, span [-47, -36] for right-moving, speed 3.\n\nAt time t=4+τ, span = [ -47 + 3τ, -36 + 3τ ]\n\n0 is in span if -47 + 3τ <= 0 <= -36 + 3τ\n\nSo -47 + 3τ <= 0 and 0 <= -36 + 3τ\n\nFirst inequality: -47 + 3τ <= 0 => 3τ <= 47 => τ <= 47/3 ≈ 15.666, so τ <= 15 since integer τ? Time is in turns, so τ integer.\n\nτ is turn offset, so discrete, τ=0,1,2,...\n\nSimilarly, second inequality: 0 <= -36 + 3τ => 3τ >= 36 => τ >= 12\n\nSo τ >=12 and τ <=15? Let's see:\n\n-47 + 3τ <= 0 => τ <= floor(47/3) = 15.666, so τ <=15\n\n0 <= -36 + 3τ => 3τ >=36, τ >=12\n\nSo for τ=12,13,14,15\n\nAt τ=12: span = [-47+36, -36+36] = [-11,0], so 0 is included.\n\nAt τ=13: [-47+39, -36+39] = [-8,3], 0 in\n\nτ=14: [-47+42, -36+42] = [-5,6], 0 in\n\nτ=15: [-47+45, -36+45] = [-2,9], 0 in\n\nAt τ=16: [-47+48, -36+48] = [1,12], 0 not in, since 0<1\n\nAt τ=11: [-47+33, -36+33] = [-14,-3], 0 not in\n\nSo row 1 occupied at τ=12,13,14,15\n\nSafe otherwise.\n\nNow row 2: one car (-24,-35,right,12)\n\nAt t=4, span [-35,-24]? head=-24, tail=-35, direction right, so span [tail, head] = [-35,-24] at t=4.\n\nSpeed 12.\n\nAt t=4+τ, span [ -35 + 12τ, -24 + 12τ ]\n\n0 in span if -35 +12τ <= 0 <= -24 +12τ\n\nSo -35 +12τ <= 0 => 12τ <=35 => τ <= 35/12 ≈ 2.916, so τ <=2\n\nAnd 0 <= -24 +12τ => 12τ >=24 => τ >=2\n\nτ <=2 and τ >=2, so only τ=2\n\nAt τ=2: span [ -35+24, -24+24] = [-11, 0], 0 included.\n\nAt τ=1: [ -35+12, -24+12] = [-23,-12], 0 not in\n\nτ=3: [ -35+36, -24+36] = [1,12], 0 not in\n\nSo row 2 occupied only at τ=2\n\nSimilarly, row 3: same as row 2, one car (-24,-35,right,12), so occupied only at τ=2\n\nRow 4: same, occupied only at τ=2\n\nRow 5: same, occupied only at τ=2\n\nNow row 6: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (-24,-35,right,12) same as above, so at τ=2, it covers 0, but there might be other cars.\n\nSecond car: (48,37,right,12), head=48, tail=37, span [37,48] at t=4.\n\nAt t=4+τ, [37 +12τ, 48 +12τ]\n\n0 in span? 37+12τ <= 0 <=48+12τ\n\n37+12τ <=0? But 37>0, 12τ>=0, so left part always positive, never <=0, so 0 never in this span since min is 37>0.\n\nSo only the first car matters for row 6, which covers 0 at τ=2.\n\nThus row 6 occupied at τ=2.\n\nNow row 7: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (-24,-35,right,6), head=-24, tail=-35, speed 6.\n\nAt t=4, span [-35,-24]\n\nAt t=4+τ, [ -35 +6τ, -24 +6τ ]\n\n0 in span if -35 +6τ <=0 <= -24 +6τ\n\nSo -35 +6τ <=0 => 6τ <=35 => τ <= 35/6 ≈5.833, τ <=5\n\nAnd 0 <= -24 +6τ => 6τ >=24 => τ >=4\n\nSo τ=4,5\n\nAt τ=4: [ -35+24, -24+24] = [-11,0], 0 in\n\nτ=5: [ -35+30, -24+30] = [-5,6], 0 in\n\nSecond car: (24,13,right,6), head=24, tail=13, span [13,24] at t=4\n\nAt t=4+τ, [13+6τ, 24+6τ]\n\n0 in span? 13+6τ <=0 <=24+6τ\n\n13+6τ <=0? 6τ <= -13, impossible since τ>=0.\n\nSo never covers 0.\n\nThus for row 7, only first car matters, occupied at τ=4 and τ=5.\n\nSimilarly, row 8: same as row 7, two cars: first (-24,-35,right,6) same, occupied τ=4,5; second (24,13,right,6) never covers 0.\n\nSo row 8 occupied τ=4,5.\n\nNow, summarize for each row, the occupied times:\n\n- Row 1: occupied τ=12,13,14,15\n\n- Row 2: occupied τ=2\n\n- Row 3: occupied τ=2\n\n- Row 4: occupied τ=2\n\n- Row 5: occupied τ=2\n\n- Row 6: occupied τ=2\n\n- Row 7: occupied τ=4,5\n\n- Row 8: occupied τ=4,5\n\nAnd for rows not listed, but all rows have cars? Rows 1 to 8 all have cars, as per table.\n\nRow 1 has car, row 2 to 5 have one each, row 6 two, row 7 two, row 8 two.\n\nBut row 6,7,8 have multiple, but we found only specific times occupied.\n\nNow, player starts at τ=0, y=3.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\ny must be integer, 0 to 9.\n\nThe rows that need to be crossed are y=4 to y=8 to reach y=9, but since player is at y=3, and target y=9, we need to go through y=4,5,6,7,8,9.\n\nBut we might stay or move down, but since we want min time, probably go up directly if possible.\n\nFirst, let's see the occupied times for each row around the path.\n\nPlayer at τ=0, y=3.\n\ny=3 is not a freeway, I think. Freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, no cars, so always safe.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe rows, no cars.\n\nAt τ=0, player on y=3, which is row 3? y=3 is freeway row 3.\n\nFreeway k=1 to 8 correspond to y=1 to 8, I assume.\n\nIn the problem, freeway y=1,2,...,8.\n\nAnd player position y=0 to 9.\n\nSo at y=3, it is freeway row 3.\n\nAt τ=0, row 3: occupied at τ=2, but τ=0 now, so at τ=0, is row 3 occupied?\n\nFrom above, row 3 occupied only at τ=2, so at τ=0, it should be safe.\n\nSimilarly, for any row, if not in the occupied times, safe.\n\nNow, at τ=0, y=3: row 3 is safe at τ=0, since occupied only τ=2.\n\nPlayer is at y=3 at time τ=0.\n\nNow, we need to reach y=9 at some τ=H-1.\n\nSince y increases by at most 1 per turn, min H-1 = 6 if we go up every turn, so H=7 actions? Let's see.\n\nActions from τ=0 to τ=H-1, so at τ=0, we do a_0, which sets y_1, and so on, up to a_{H-1} which sets y_H, but we need y at τ=H-1 to be 9.\n\nDefine the time carefully.\n\nAt turn τ, we are at position y_τ.\n\nThen we choose action a_τ, which determines y_{τ+1}.\n\nCollision at turn τ: we are at y_τ, and we check if for row y_τ, at global time t=4+τ, there is a car with 0 in span.\n\nWe need no collision at each turn from τ=0 to when we reach y=9.\n\nWe reach y=9 at some turn, say at turn T, y_T=9, and since y=9 is safe, no issue.\n\nBut we need to be at y=9 at some τ, and for all previous positions, no collision.\n\nNow, min H such that after H actions, we are at y=9.\n\nSince we start at τ=0, y=3, after 0 actions, we are at y=3.\n\nAfter first action, at τ=1, we are at y_1, and so on.\n\nAfter k actions, at time τ=k, we are at y_k.\n\nWe need y_H =9 for some H.\n\nAnd for each τ from 0 to H-1, at position y_τ, no collision at time τ.\n\nAt time τ, position y_τ, and collision check at time τ.\n\nFor τ=H, if we are at y_H=9, and y=9 safe, no collision.\n\nBut since we only care up to when we reach y=9, and at that point it's safe.\n\nNow, min H such that y_H=9, starting from y_0=3.\n\ny_H - y_0 =6 if we go directly up, so H=6 if we can go up each turn, but y_0=3, after one up, y_1=4, after two y_2=5, ..., after six up, y_6=9, so at τ=6, y=9.\n\nSo possible in 6 turns if no collisions.\n\nBut we need to check for each step if we can be on that row at that time without collision.\n\nSo let's simulate going up every turn.\n\nStart τ=0, y=3: row 3, occupied only τ=2, so at τ=0 safe.\n\nAction U, so y_1=4 at τ=1.\n\nAt τ=1, y=4: row 4, occupied only τ=2, so at τ=1, safe.\n\nAction U, y_2=5 at τ=2.\n\nAt τ=2, y=5: row 5, occupied at τ=2? Row 5 occupied at τ=2, yes.\n\nProblem! At τ=2, if we are on row 5, it is occupied, collision.\n\nCannot be on row 5 at τ=2.\n\nSimilarly, rows 2,3,4,6 all occupied at τ=2.\n\nOnly rows not occupied at τ=2 are row 1,7,8? Row 1 occupied τ=12-15, not 2; row 7 occupied τ=4,5 not 2; row 8 same.\n\nBut y=0 and y=9 always safe.\n\nAt τ=2, if we are on y=0,1,7,8,9, safe? y=1 is row 1, which at τ=2 is safe since occupied τ=12-15.\n\nSimilarly y=7 row7, safe at τ=2.\n\nBut in our path, at τ=2, we are trying to be at y=5, which is occupied.\n\nSo need to avoid being on rows 2,3,4,5,6 at τ=2.\n\nSpecifically, at time τ=2, rows 2,3,4,5,6 are all occupied.\n\nNow, also at τ=4 and 5, rows 7 and 8 are occupied.\n\nBut let's list safe times for each row.\n\nFor each row, the times when it is safe (not occupied).\n\nSince occupied at specific τ, safe when not those times.\n\n- Row 1: occupied τ=12,13,14,15 → safe for τ not in {12,13,14,15}, i.e., τ<=11 or τ>=16\n\n- Row 2: occupied only τ=2 → safe for τ≠2\n\n- Row 3: same, safe τ≠2\n\n- Row 4: safe τ≠2\n\n- Row 5: safe τ≠2\n\n- Row 6: safe τ≠2\n\n- Row 7: occupied τ=4,5 → safe τ≠4 and τ≠5, i.e., τ<=3 or τ>=6\n\n- Row 8: occupied τ=4,5 → safe τ≠4,5, so τ<=3 or τ>=6\n\nNow, player at τ=0, y=3.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nSince at τ=2, rows 2-6 are unsafe, we must not be on any of rows 2,3,4,5,6 at τ=2.\n\nSimilarly, at τ=4 and 5, rows 7 and 8 are unsafe, so must not be on row 7 or 8 at τ=4 or τ=5.\n\nNow, to minimize H, we want to go up as fast as possible.\n\nBut we need to avoid being on forbidden rows at forbidden times.\n\nOne way is to stay on y=3 or move to safe rows at critical times.\n\nFor example, at τ=2, we need to be on a row not in 2-6, so y=0,1,7,8,9.\n\nBut y=9 is target, far, y=7 or 8 might be possible.\n\nSince we start at y=3 at τ=0.\n\nPossible actions.\n\nFirst, at τ=0, y=3, safe, we can do U, D, or S.\n\nIf we do U, at τ=1, y=4.\n\nAt τ=1, y=4: row 4, occupied only τ=2, so at τ=1 safe.\n\nThen at τ=1, if we do U, to y=5 at τ=2, but at τ=2, y=5 unsafe.\n\nIf at τ=1, we do S, stay at y=4, but at τ=2, y=4 is row 4, unsafe at τ=2.\n\nIf at τ=1, we do D, to y=3 at τ=2, but y=3 is row 3, unsafe at τ=2.\n\nSo if we are on y=4 at τ=1, no matter what we do, at τ=2 we will be on a row between 3 and 5? y=4 at τ=1, if S, y=4 at τ=2; if U, y=5 at τ=2; if D, y=3 at τ=2. All unsafe at τ=2.\n\nSimilarly, if we start at τ=0, and do S, stay at y=3 at τ=1.\n\nAt τ=1, y=3: row 3 safe at τ=1? τ=1, row 3 occupied only τ=2, so safe at τ=1.\n\nBut then at τ=1, if we do U to y=4 at τ=2, unsafe; if S, y=3 at τ=2, unsafe; if D, to y=2 at τ=2, row 2 unsafe at τ=2.\n\nSo if we are at y=3 at τ=1, all actions lead to unsafe at τ=2.\n\nTherefore, we cannot be on rows 3,4,5 at τ=1, because from there, we end up on row 2,3,4,5,6 at τ=2.\n\nSpecifically, at τ=1, if we are on y=3,4,5, then at τ=2, we can be on y=2,3,4,5,6 depending on action, but all these are unsafe at τ=2.\n\nIf at τ=1 we are on y=2, then at τ=2, if U to y=3, unsafe; S y=2 unsafe; D to y=1, which is row 1, safe at τ=2? Row 1 safe at τ=2, since occupied only later.\n\nSimilarly, if at τ=1 on y=1, then at τ=2, U to y=2 unsafe, S y=1 safe, D to y=0 safe.\n\nBut y=0 safe.\n\nSimilarly, if at τ=1 on y=6, row 6, safe at τ=1? Row 6 occupied only τ=2, so at τ=1 safe, but at τ=2, if on y=6, unsafe; if U to y=7, row 7 at τ=2 is safe? Row 7 safe at τ=2, since occupied τ=4,5.\n\nSimilarly, if at τ=1 on y=7, safe, and at τ=2 can be safe.\n\nTo avoid being caught at τ=2 on unsafe rows, we need to be on a safe row at τ=2.\n\nSafe rows at τ=2: y=0,1,7,8,9 (since rows 1,7,8 safe, y=0 and 9 always safe)\n\nNow, at τ=0, we are at y=3.\n\nWe need to move to one of these safe rows by τ=2.\n\nSince we have two steps: from τ=0 to τ=1 and τ=1 to τ=2.\n\nAt τ=0, y=3.\n\nAfter action at τ=0, we go to y at τ=1.\n\nThen after action at τ=1, to y at τ=2.\n\nWe need y at τ=2 to be in {0,1,7,8,9}\n\nPossible ways:\n\nFrom y=3 at τ=0, we can go to y=2,3,4 at τ=1 (by D,S,U)\n\nThen from there to y at τ=2.\n\nBut we need y_2 in {0,1,7,8,9}\n\nIf we go to y=4 at τ=1, then from y=4, we can go to y=3,4,5 at τ=2, all not in safe set.\n\nSimilarly, if to y=3 at τ=1, then to y=2,3,4 at τ=2, not safe except possibly y=2 but row 2 unsafe at τ=2.\n\ny=2 is row 2, unsafe at τ=2.\n\nIf to y=2 at τ=1, from y=3 at τ=0, do D, to y=2 at τ=1.\n\nAt τ=1, y=2: row 2, occupied only τ=2, so at τ=1 safe.\n\nThen from y=2 at τ=1, we can do: U to y=3 at τ=2, unsafe; S to y=2 at τ=2, unsafe; D to y=1 at τ=2.\n\ny=1 at τ=2: row 1, safe, as above.\n\nSo possible: at τ=0, do D to y=2 at τ=1; then at τ=1, do D to y=1 at τ=2.\n\nThen at τ=2, y=1, safe.\n\nWe could go to other safe rows, but y=7,8,9 are higher, far.\n\nFrom y=3, to reach y=7 in one step? Not possible, max +1 per turn.\n\nAt τ=0 y=3, after U at τ=0, to y=4 at τ=1; then at τ=1 if we do U, to y=5 at τ=2 unsafe, or S y=4 unsafe, D y=3 unsafe. No way to y=7 from here in one step.\n\nSimilarly, to go down to y=1 as above.\n\nWe could go up to y=6 or something, but at τ=1, if we are on y=6.\n\nHow? From y=3 at τ=0, we need to go up.\n\nAt τ=0, do U to y=4 at τ=1.\n\nBut at τ=1 y=4, then to reach a safe row at τ=2, we need to go to y=7 or 8, but from y=4, we can only go to y=3,4,5 at τ=2, not to 7.\n\nImpossible to jump.\n\nSo only possibility is to go down to y=1 or up to y=7,8 but not reachable in two steps from y=3.\n\ny=3 to y=7 is +4, min 4 steps, but we have only 2 steps to τ=2.\n\nSo impossible to reach y=7,8,9 by τ=2 from y=3.\n\nThus, the only safe options at τ=2 are y=0 or y=1.\n\ny=0 or 1.\n\nIn the path above, we can go to y=1 at τ=2.\n\nWe could go to y=0.\n\nBut y=0 is safe, but lower, might take longer to reach y=9.\n\nSimilarly, y=1 is closer.\n\nNow, after τ=2, we need to go up, but there is another problem at τ=4 and 5 with rows 7 and 8 occupied.\n\nFirst, let's plan to be at y=1 at τ=2.\n\nThen from there, go up to y=9.\n\nBut need to avoid the row 7 and 8 at τ=4 and 5.\n\nAlso, row 1 has occupancy at τ=12-15, but that might be later, if we go fast, we might not be affected.\n\nNow, at τ=2, y=1.\n\ny=1 is row 1, which is safe now, but will be occupied at τ=12,13,14,15, but since we are going up, we might not be there then.\n\nNow, from y=1 at τ=2, we can start going up.\n\nBut we need to go through rows 2 to 8.\n\nNow, rows 2-6 are safe except at τ=2, but τ=2 is past, so for τ>2, all safe except row 1 at later times.\n\nRow 2: safe for τ≠2, so for τ>2, always safe since τ=2 passed.\n\nSimilarly row 3,4,5,6: safe for τ>2.\n\nRow 7: safe for τ<=3 or τ>=6, but τ>2, so for τ=3,4,5,6,...\n\nAt τ=3, row 7 safe? Safe when τ<=3 or τ>=6, so τ=3 <=3, safe.\n\nτ=4 and 5 not safe.\n\nSimilarly row 8 same.\n\nNow, from τ=2, y=1.\n\nWe can go up.\n\nBut if we go up directly, at τ=2, y=1, do U, to y=2 at τ=3.\n\nAt τ=3, y=2: row 2, safe since τ=3≠2.\n\nDo U to y=3 at τ=4.\n\nAt τ=4, y=3: row 3, safe since τ=4≠2.\n\nDo U to y=4 at τ=5.\n\nAt τ=5, y=4: row 4, safe.\n\nDo U to y=5 at τ=6.\n\nAt τ=6, y=5: row 5, safe.\n\nDo U to y=6 at τ=7.\n\nAt τ=7, y=6: row 6, safe.\n\nDo U to y=7 at τ=8.\n\nAt τ=8, y=7: row 7, at τ=8, which is >=6, so safe.\n\nThen U to y=8 at τ=9.\n\nAt τ=9, y=8: row 8, safe since τ=9>=6.\n\nThen U to y=9 at τ=10.\n\nAt τ=10, y=9, done.\n\nBut at τ=4 and τ=5, we were on y=3 and y=4, which are safe, since rows 3 and 4 only unsafe at τ=2.\n\nIn this path, at τ=4, y=3; τ=5, y=4; both safe.\n\nBut we have the issue with rows 7 and 8 at τ=4 and 5, but in this path, we are not on row 7 or 8 at τ=4 or 5.\n\nAt τ=4 we are on y=3, row 3; τ=5 y=4, row 4.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nBut is this minimal? We started from y=1 at τ=2, and reached y=9 at τ=10, so from τ=0 to τ=10, 11 steps? Let's count.\n\nτ=0: y=3, action? We need to get to y=1 at τ=2.\n\nEarlier: at τ=0, y=3, do D to y=2 at τ=1.\n\nAt τ=1, y=2, do D to y=1 at τ=2.\n\nThen at τ=2, y=1, do U to y=2 at τ=3.\n\n...\n\nUp to at τ=10, y=9.\n\nActions from τ=0 to τ=9? Let's list positions over time.\n\nAt time τ, position y_τ.\n\nτ=0: y=3\n\nAfter action a_0, y_1 set.\n\nPerhaps better to think of the sequence.\n\nAt turn τ, we perform action a_τ, which sets y_{τ+1}.\n\nBut the position at time τ is y_τ before action? Standard: at the start of turn τ, we are at y_τ, then we choose action a_τ, which determines y_{τ+1}, and we move to that position for the next turn.\n\nCollision is checked at turn τ based on position y_τ.\n\nIn this case:\n\nAt τ=0: position y_0=3, we choose a_0, which sets y_1.\n\nCollision at τ=0: based on y_0=3, row 3, safe as above.\n\nWe choose a_0 = D, so y_1 = 3 -1 =2\n\nThen at τ=1: position y_1=2, row 2, at time τ=1, row 2 occupied only τ=2, so at τ=1 safe.\n\nChoose a_1 = D, so y_2 = 2 -1 =1\n\nAt τ=2: position y_2=1, row 1, at time τ=2, row 1 safe (occupied only later), so safe.\n\nChoose a_2 = U, so y_3 =1 +1=2\n\nAt τ=3: position y_3=2, row 2, at time τ=3, safe since τ=3≠2.\n\nChoose a_3 = U, so y_4=3\n\nAt τ=4: position y_4=3, row 3, at τ=4, safe.\n\nChoose a_4 = U, so y_5=4\n\nAt τ=5: position y_5=4, row 4, at τ=5, safe (only unsafe at τ=2)\n\nChoose a_5 = U, so y_6=5\n\nAt τ=6: position y_6=5, row 5, safe.\n\nChoose a_6 = U, so y_7=6\n\nAt τ=7: position y_7=6, row 6, safe.\n\nChoose a_7 = U, so y_8=7\n\nAt τ=8: position y_8=7, row 7, at τ=8, safe since τ=8>=6.\n\nChoose a_8 = U, so y_9=8\n\nAt τ=9: position y_9=8, row 8, at τ=9, safe.\n\nChoose a_9 = U, so y_10=9\n\nNow at τ=10: position y_10=9, which is the target, and safe.\n\nWe reached y=9 at τ=10.\n\nNumber of actions: from τ=0 to τ=9, that's 10 actions? τ from 0 to 9, 10 turns.\n\nBut we start at τ=0, after H actions, at τ=H, y_H=9.\n\nIn this case, y_10=9, so H=10.\n\nBut we might do better.\n\nSince we went down to y=1, it took extra steps.\n\nCan we avoid going down?\n\nFor example, at τ=2, instead of being at y=1, can we be at y=7 or 8?\n\nBut from y=3 at τ=0, to y=7 at τ=2: need +4 in 2 steps, impossible, since max +2.\n\ny=8 even worse.\n\ny=0: at τ=0 y=3, do D to y=2 at τ=1, do D to y=1 at τ=2, or do D twice to y=1, or to y=0.\n\nFor example, at τ=0, y=3, do D to y=2 at τ=1; τ=1 y=2, do D to y=1 at τ=2 as above, or at τ=1 do D again to y=1? y=2 to y=1 is D, but then y=1 at τ=2.\n\nTo y=0: at τ=1 y=2, do D to y=1, but to y=0, need another down.\n\nAt τ=1 y=2, if do D, to y=1 at τ=2.\n\nThen from y=1 at τ=2, do D to y=0 at τ=3, but that is lower, worse.\n\nSo y=1 at τ=2 is better than y=0.\n\nBut still, from there we took 8 more steps to y=9, total 10 turns from start.\n\nBut at τ=0 we are at y=3, and at τ=10 y=9, difference 6, but with 2 down and 8 up, net +6, yes.\n\nBut perhaps we can be on a safe row at τ=2 without going down.\n\nFor example, if we go up to y=6 or 7 by τ=2.\n\nBut y=6 at τ=2: row 6 is unsafe at τ=2.\n\ny=7: from y=3, to y=7 at τ=2, impossible.\n\nAt τ=1, we can be at y=4,5,6,etc.\n\nBut if at τ=1 we are at y=6, for example.\n\nHow? From y=3 at τ=0, do U to y=4 at τ=1; then at τ=1, from y=4, do U to y=5 at τ=2, but y=5 unsafe at τ=2.\n\nDo S at y=4, then at τ=2 y=4 unsafe.\n\nDo D to y=3, unsafe.\n\nNo.\n\nFrom y=3 at τ=0, do U to y=4 at τ=1.\n\nBut y=4 at τ=1 is safe, but then stuck for τ=2.\n\nUnless we can go to y=7 from y=4 at τ=1, but in one action, only to y=3,4,5.\n\nImpossible.\n\nSo indeed, the only way to be safe at τ=2 is to be at y=0 or y=1.\n\ny=1 is better.\n\nBut y=1 at τ=2.\n\nNow, from there, we can go up faster, but we have to deal with rows 7 and 8 at τ=4 and 5.\n\nIn the previous path, we were on lower rows at τ=4 and 5, so no issue.\n\nBut perhaps we can reach higher faster.\n\nFor example, from y=1 at τ=2, we go up.\n\nBut at τ=4 and 5, rows 7 and 8 are occupied, so we must not be on row 7 or 8 at τ=4 or τ=5.\n\nIn the path above, at τ=4 we were at y=3, τ=5 at y=4, fine.\n\nBut we can be higher earlier.\n\nFor instance, at τ=2, y=1.\n\nDo U to y=2 at τ=3.\n\nAt τ=3, y=2, do U to y=3 at τ=4.\n\nAt τ=4, y=3, safe.\n\nBut now, if we want to go faster, at τ=4, instead of U to y=4, we can do U multiple times.\n\nBut we need to avoid being on row 7 or 8 at τ=4 and τ=5.\n\nτ=4 and τ=5.\n\nNow, at τ=4, if we are on y=7 or 8, unsafe; similarly τ=5.\n\nSo we must not be on y=7 or 8 at τ=4, and not at τ=5.\n\nIn the sequence, from y=3 at τ=4, we can go up.\n\nBut to reach y=9 quickly.\n\nLet me list the positions:\n\nτ=2: y=1\n\na_2 = U, y_3=2\n\nτ=3: y=2, a_3=U, y_4=3\n\nτ=4: y=3, a_4=U, y_5=4\n\nτ=5: y=4, a_5=U, y_6=5\n\nτ=6: y=5, a_6=U, y_7=6\n\nτ=7: y=6, a_7=U, y_8=7\n\nτ=8: y=7, a_8=U, y_9=8\n\nτ=9: y=8, a_9=U, y_10=9\n\nAs before.\n\nAt τ=5, we are at y=4, but we could be higher.\n\nFor example, at τ=3, y=2, instead of U to y=3, we can do U twice? At τ=3, from y=2, we can only set y_4.\n\na_3 action sets y_4.\n\nAt τ=3, y=2, if we do U, y_4=3; if we do nothing, y_4=2; D to y_4=1.\n\nTo go faster, we need multiple up actions.\n\nBut at τ=4, we can be at higher y.\n\nFor instance, at τ=3, y=2, do U to y_4=3.\n\ny_4=3 at τ=4.\n\nBut we can have y higher at τ=4.\n\nFor example, if at τ=2, y=1, we do U to y_3=2.\n\nThen at τ=3, y=2, we do U to y_4=3, as above.\n\nCannot be higher because from y=1 at τ=2, after one action to y=2 at τ=3, then another to y=3 at τ=4.\n\nSo at τ=4, y=3.\n\nSimilarly, at τ=5, from y=3 at τ=4, do U to y_5=4.\n\nSo at τ=5, y=4.\n\nNow, rows 7 and 8 unsafe at τ=4 and 5, but we are on lower rows, so fine.\n\nBut after that, we go up steadily.\n\nNow, to save time, perhaps we can reach y=9 sooner.\n\nBut from y=4 at τ=5 to y=9, need +5, so min at τ=10, as above.\n\ny_5=4 at τ=5, then y_6=5, y_7=6, y_8=7, y_9=8, y_10=9.\n\nYes.\n\nBut is there a way to be higher at earlier times?\n\nFor example, at τ=2, we are at y=1, but if we could be at higher y at τ=2, but we can't from start.\n\nAnother idea: instead of going down to y=1, go to y=7 or 8 before τ=2? But not possible.\n\nPerhaps stay at y=3 but avoid τ=2 by being elsewhere, but we have to move.\n\nAt τ=0, y=3, we could do nothing, stay at y=3 at τ=1, but then at τ=1 y=3, and at τ=2 we are forced to unsafe.\n\nUnless we go down to y=1 as before.\n\nPerhaps go up to y=6 at τ=1, but y=6 at τ=1 is safe, but at τ=2, if we go to y=7, which is safe.\n\ny=7 at τ=2 is safe.\n\nHow to get to y=7 at τ=2?\n\nFrom start: at τ=0, y=3, do U to y=4 at τ=1.\n\nAt τ=1, y=4, do U to y=5 at τ=2? But y=5 at τ=2 unsafe.\n\nCannot go to y=7.\n\nUnless we do multiple actions, but per turn only one move.\n\nSo impossible to be at y=7 at τ=2.\n\nThus, only options are y=0 or y=1 at τ=2.\n\ny=1 is better.\n\nNow, back to rows 7 and 8 at τ=4 and 5.\n\nIn the path, we are not affected.\n\nBut we can optimize after τ=2.\n\nFor example, from y=1 at τ=2, we can go up faster? No, each step takes one turn.\n\nMin steps to y=9 is 8 steps from y=1: to y=2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9, 8 actions.\n\nFrom τ=2 to τ=10, 8 actions, but τ=2 to τ=10 is 8 steps? Positions: at τ=2 y=1, after first action to y=2 at τ=3, ..., after 8th action to y=9 at τ=10.\n\nYes.\n\nBut τ=10 is the time when we reach.\n\nNow, total from start: τ=0 to τ=10, 11 positions, 10 actions? Let's clarify.\n\nTime τ: from 0 to 10, that's 11 time points.\n\nBut at τ=0, we start, no action yet, position y_0=3.\n\nAfter action a_0, we go to y_1 at τ=1.\n\nAfter a_1, to y_2 at τ=2, and so on, after a_9, to y_10 at τ=10.\n\nWe need y_10=9.\n\nNumber of actions: 10.\n\nIn terms of turns: from turn t_1=4 (τ=0) to turn t_1 + H -1, but in the sequence, actions from t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nIn the answer, it should be actions for turns starting from t_1.\n\nIn the problem: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" so for t from 0 to H-1, actions at time t_1 + t.\n\nAnd after H actions, at turn t_1 + H -1, position should be (0,9)? Let's see.\n\n\"reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1\"\n\nFrom the problem: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1\"\n\nYes.\n\nSo at turn T = t_1 + H -1, position is (0,9).\n\nNow, at time T, we are at y_T=9.\n\nIn terms of our τ, τ = t - t_1, so at τ = H-1, y=9.\n\nIn our case, at τ=10, y=9, so H-1=10, thus H=11.\n\nτ=H-1, y=9.\n\nIn our path, at τ=10, y=9, so H-1=10, H=11.\n\nActions from τ=0 to τ=9, that's H=10 actions? Let's see.\n\nSequence: actions at times t_1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nAfter these H actions, we are at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nFor example, after 0 actions, at turn t_1, position initial.\n\nAfter 1 action, at turn t_1 +1 -1 = t_1, position after first action? I think I have confusion.\n\nStandard: let’s say at the beginning of turn T, we are at position y_T.\n\nThen we choose action a_T, which sets y_{T+1} for the next turn.\n\nAfter choosing a_T, we move to y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nCollision at turn T is based on y_T.\n\nIn this notation, for turn T, position y_T.\n\nThen action a_T sets y_{T+1}.\n\nWe start at turn t_1, position given.\n\nWe perform actions at turn t_1, t_1+1, ..., up to some turn.\n\nWe need to be at (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nThat means, at turn t_1 + H -1, y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nAnd we have performed H actions: at turns t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nAfter H actions, we have executed a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1}, and at turn t_1 + H -1, we are at position y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nIn terms of τ: set τ such that turn = t_1 + τ.\n\nAt τ=0, turn t_1, position y=3.\n\nAfter action at τ=0, we set y for τ=1, and so on.\n\nAt turn τ, we perform action a_τ, setting y_{τ+1}.\n\nBut the position at time τ is y_τ.\n\nWe need y_τ =9 at τ = H-1.\n\nBecause at turn t_1 + (H-1), position should be 9.\n\nIn our earlier path, at τ=10, y=9, so H-1=10, H=11.\n\nAnd we have actions from τ=0 to τ=9 (10 actions) to reach y_10=9.\n\nYes.\n\nBut in that path, we used 10 actions to go from y=3 to y=9 with net +6, but we had two downs, so total moves: 2 down + 8 up = 10 actions, net +6.\n\nNow, can we do with fewer?\n\nPerhaps by not going down, or by timing.\n\nAnother idea: at τ=2, instead of being at y=1, can we be at y=8 or 9? But not possible.\n\nPerhaps we can be on y=7 or 8 at τ=4 or 5, but since they are occupied, we need to avoid them at those times.\n\nFor example, if we can reach y=6 by τ=4, then at τ=4, be on y=6, safe, then at τ=5, go to y=7, but row 7 occupied at τ=5, so if at τ=5 we are on y=7, unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, if at τ=4 on y=7, unsafe.\n\nSo at τ=4 and τ=5, we must not be on y=7 or 8.\n\nPossible to be on y=6 or y=9, etc.\n\nIn our current path, we are on y=3 and y=4 at τ=4 and 5, which is fine.\n\nBut we can be higher.\n\nFor example, from y=1 at τ=2, we can go up faster? But each step takes a turn.\n\nAt τ=2, y=1\n\nDo U to y=2 at τ=3\n\nDo U to y=3 at τ=4\n\nNow at τ=4, y=3\n\nInstead of U to y=4, we can do nothing, but that delays.\n\nDo U to y=4 at τ=5\n\nAt τ=5, y=4\n\nThen U to y=5 at τ=6, etc, same as before.\n\nBut at τ=4, if we do U, y_5=4, so at τ=5 y=4.\n\nIf we do S at τ=4, y_5=3, then at τ=5 y=3, then U to y=4 at τ=6, worse.\n\nSo no benefit.\n\nFrom τ=3, y=2, we do U to y=3 at τ=4.\n\nBut at τ=3, we can do double? No.\n\nPerhaps we can reach y=5 or 6 at τ=4.\n\nBut from y=1 at τ=2, to y=5 at τ=4: need +4 in 2 steps, impossible, max +2.\n\ny=4 at τ=4: possible, but in our path, at τ=4 y=3, to y=4 at τ=5.\n\nTo have y=4 at τ=4: from y=1 at τ=2, do U to y=2 at τ=3, then at τ=3 do U to y=3 at τ=4? y_4=3.\n\nTo have y=4 at τ=4, we need to be at y=4 at time τ=4.\n\nFrom y=1 at τ=2, after first action to y=2 at τ=3, after second action to y=3 at τ=4, cannot reach y=4.\n\nSo at τ=4, we are at y=3 in the fastest path.\n\nSimilarly, at τ=5, y=4.\n\nThen proceed.\n\nNow, after that, we go to y=5 at τ=6, y=6 at τ=7, y=7 at τ=8, y=8 at τ=9, y=9 at τ=10.\n\nAt τ=7, y=6, row 6 safe.\n\nAt τ=8, y=7, row 7: at τ=8, which is >=6, safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut row 7 safe for τ<=3 or τ>=6.\n\nτ=8>=6, safe.\n\nSimilarly row 8.\n\nNow, is there a way to reach y=9 earlier?\n\nFor example, if we can be on y=8 at τ=5, but y=8 occupied at τ=5, cannot.\n\nOr at τ=6, we can be on y=8? Not from below.\n\nSuppose at τ=2 we are at y=1, but instead of going directly up, we go to a row that allows faster ascent later, but all rows are similar.\n\nPerhaps we can go to y=9 directly, but no.\n\nAnother thought: since rows 7 and 8 are safe before τ=4, we can be on them earlier.\n\nFor example, at τ=3, row 7 is safe (since τ=3<=3).\n\nSimilarly, row 8 safe at τ=3.\n\nBut to be on row 7 at τ=3, we need y=7 at τ=3.\n\nBut from y=1 at τ=2, we can only go to y=2 at τ=3.\n\nCannot reach y=7.\n\nFrom start, if we could be higher at τ=2, but we can't.\n\nSo I think the path we have is optimal in terms of time, with H=11.\n\nBut let's confirm the number.\n\nIn the path:\n\nActions:\n\nAt τ=0 (turn t_1): D (to y=2)\n\nAt τ=1: D (to y=1)\n\nAt τ=2: U (to y=2)\n\nAt τ=3: U (to y=3)\n\nAt τ=4: U (to y=4)\n\nAt τ=5: U (to y=5)\n\nAt τ=6: U (to y=6)\n\nAt τ=7: U (to y=7)\n\nAt τ=8: U (to y=8)\n\nAt τ=9: U (to y=9)\n\nNow, positions:\n\nAt τ=0: y=3 (before any action, but after action a_0, y for τ=1 is set)\n\nAfter a_0 (D), y_1=2\n\nAt τ=1: y=2, after a_1 (D), y_2=1\n\nAt τ=2: y=1, after a_2 (U), y_3=2\n\nAt τ=3: y=2, after a_3 (U), y_4=3\n\nAt τ=4: y=3, after a_4 (U), y_5=4\n\nAt τ=5: y=4, after a_5 (U), y_6=5\n\nAt τ=6: y=5, after a_6 (U), y_7=6\n\nAt τ=7: y=6, after a_7 (U), y_8=7\n\nAt τ=8: y=7, after a_8 (U), y_9=8\n\nAt τ=9: y=8, after a_9 (U), y_10=9\n\nAt τ=10: y=9\n\nAnd we reach y=9 at τ=10, which is H-1=10, so H=11.\n\nNow, is there a shorter path?\n\nSuppose we go down to y=0 at τ=2.\n\nAt τ=0: D to y=2\n\nτ=1: D to y=1? Or to y=0.\n\nAt τ=0: D, y_1=2\n\nτ=1: y=2, if D, y_2=1, same as before.\n\nIf at τ=1, do D again, y_2=1.\n\nTo y=0: at τ=1, y=2, do D to y_1? a_1=D, y_2=1, not to 0.\n\nTo reach y=0 at τ=2: from y=2 at τ=1, do D to y_2=1, then at τ=2 y=1, then do D to y_3=0, but at τ=3 y=0, later.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo y=1 at τ=2 is best.\n\nPerhaps we can avoid the down by waiting, but at τ=0, if we stay, at τ=1 y=3, then at τ=2 forced down or something, but we have to go to safe row.\n\nAnother idea: go up to y=6 at τ=1.\n\nAt τ=0: U to y=4? a_0=U, y_1=4\n\nAt τ=1: y=4, which is safe.\n\nThen at τ=1, if we do U, to y=5 at τ=2, unsafe.\n\nIf we do D, to y=3 at τ=2, unsafe.\n\nS, y=4 at τ=2, unsafe.\n\nNo.\n\nUnless at τ=1, from y=4, we do nothing, but then at τ=2 y=4 unsafe.\n\nSo no.\n\nThus, going down to y=1 is necessary to avoid τ=2.\n\nThen from there, the path to y=9 takes 8 up actions, but we have 2 down actions, total 10 actions to reach y=9 from y=3 with net +6.\n\nMin possible is 6 if direct, but not possible due to obstacles.\n\nSo H=11 seems minimal.\n\nBut let's see if we can reduce by combining with the row 7,8 issue.\n\nFor example, since at τ=4 and 5, rows 7 and 8 unsafe, but if we can be on y=6 at τ=4, safe, then at τ=5, if we go to y=7, but row 7 unsafe at τ=5, so collision.\n\nIf we stay at y=6 at τ=5, row 6 safe.\n\nThen at τ=6, go to y=7, safe since τ=6>=6.\n\nBut to be at y=6 at τ=4.\n\nFrom where?\n\nAt τ=2, we are at y=1.\n\nTo reach y=6 at τ=4: need +5 in 2 steps, impossible.\n\nMax y=3 at τ=4 from y=1 at τ=2: y_3=2 at τ=3, y_4=3 at τ=4.\n\nSo cannot.\n\nThus, no better.\n\nPerhaps start by going up immediately after τ=2.\n\nBut I think H=11 is the minimal.\n\nNow, in the sequence, we have to output the actions.\n\nBut in the path, we go down twice, then up all the way.\n\nBut at the beginning, we are at y=3, and we go down to y=2 then to y=1.\n\nNow, for the answer, we need to list actions starting from turn t_1=4.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 4: a_{t_1} = a_0 = D\n\nIn terms of t, turn t_1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nH=11, so t from 0 to 10.\n\nActions at turn 4 to 14? t_1=4.\n\nActions: a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to 10.\n\nThat is, from turn 4 to turn 14.\n\nAnd at turn t_1 + H -1 = 4 + 11 -1 = 14, position (0,9).\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nTurn 4: D (as above a_0=D)\n\nTurn 5: D (a_1=D)\n\nTurn 6: U (a_2=U)\n\nTurn 7: U (a_3=U)\n\nTurn 8: U (a_4=U)\n\nTurn 9: U (a_5=U)\n\nTurn 10: U (a_6=U)\n\nTurn 11: U (a_7=U)\n\nTurn 12: U (a_8=U)\n\nTurn 13: U (a_9=U)\n\nAfter a_9 at τ=9, we go to y_10=9 at τ=10.\n\nτ=10 corresponds to turn t_1 + 10 = 4 + 10 = 14.\n\nAnd at turn 14, position y=9.\n\nActions from turn 4 to 13? Let's list:\n\nt = 0: turn t_1 + 0 = 4, action a_0 = D\n\nt = 1: turn 5, action a_1 = D\n\nt = 2: turn 6, action a_2 = U\n\nt = 3: turn 7, action a_3 = U\n\nt = 4: turn 8, action a_4 = U\n\nt = 5: turn 9, action a_5 = U\n\nt = 6: turn 10, action a_6 = U\n\nt = 7: turn 11, action a_7 = U\n\nt = 8: turn 12, action a_8 = U\n\nt = 9: turn 13, action a_9 = U\n\nH=11, so t from 0 to 10, that's 11 actions.\n\nt from 0 to 10 inclusive, 11 values.\n\nAfter these 11 actions, we are at turn t_1 + H -1 = 4 + 11 -1 = 14.\n\nIn the sequence above, actions from turn 4 to turn 13, that's turns 4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13: 10 turns? Turns from 4 to 13 inclusive is 10 actions.\n\n4 to 13: 13-4+1=10 actions.\n\nBut H=11, so need 11 actions.\n\nt from 0 to 10, actions at turn t_1 + t = 4 + t, for t=0 to 10.\n\nSo turn 4+0=4, 4+1=5, 4+2=6, ..., 4+10=14.\n\nActions at turn 4 to 14? But turn 14 is the turn where we reach after action.\n\nIn the sequence, last action at turn t_1 + (H-1) = 4 + 10 = 14? t from 0 to H-1=10, so turns 4 to 14.\n\nBut turn 14: after action at turn 14, we go to position at turn 15?\n\nI think I have confusion in indexing.\n\nLet me define:\n\nLet T be the turn number.\n\nAt turn T, we are at position y_T.\n\nThen we choose action a_T, which sets y_{T+1}.\n\nCollision at turn T based on y_T.\n\nStart at turn T = t_1 = 4, y_4 = 3.\n\nWe perform actions at turns T=4,5,6,..., up to turn T=4 + K, say.\n\nAfter action at turn T, we set y_{T+1}.\n\nWe need that at some turn, say S, y_S =9.\n\nAnd S = t_1 + H -1.\n\nAfter H actions, we have executed actions at turns t_1 to t_1 + H -1, and at turn t_1 + H -1, y=9.\n\nFor example, after 0 actions, at turn t_1, y=3.\n\nAfter 1 action (at turn t_1), we set y_{t_1 +1}, so at turn t_1 +1, position y_{t_1 +1}.\n\nBut we need at turn t_1 + H -1, y=9.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t_1 + H -1, y=9.\n\nAnd actions were taken at turns t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nIn our case, t_1=4.\n\nWe need to find min H such that we can have y_{4 + H -1} =9.\n\nWith actions from turn 4 to turn 4 + H -1.\n\nIn the path, we have y at turn 14 =9, so 4 + H -1 =14, so H-1=10, H=11.\n\nActions at turns 4 to 14? Turns from 4 to 14 inclusive.\n\nNumber of actions: turns 4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14: that's 11 turns.\n\nAction at turn T sets y_{T+1}.\n\nAt turn 14, after action a_14, we set y_15, but we need y at turn 14 to be 9.\n\nAt turn 14, we are at position y_14.\n\nThen we choose a_14, which sets y_15.\n\nBut we need y_14 =9, so that at turn 14, position is 9.\n\nThen we don't need to act further, but in the sequence, we include the action that gets us there, but since at turn 14 we are already at y=9, we might not need an action, but the action is chosen to stay or something, but we can choose S.\n\nIn this case, at turn 14, we are at y_14=9, so we can choose a_14=S to stay, but it's not necessary for reaching, but we need to specify the sequence up to when we reach.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from turn t_1 to t_1 + H -1, and at turn t_1 + H -1, we reach.\n\nIn the path, at turn 14, y_14=9.\n\nHow did we get there? From previous action.\n\nIn the sequence I had:\n\nAt turn 4: action D, so y_5=2\n\nTurn 5: action D, y_6=1\n\nTurn 6: action U, y_7=2\n\nTurn 7: action U, y_8=3\n\nTurn 8: action U, y_9=4\n\nTurn 9: action U, y_10=5\n\nTurn 10: action U, y_11=6\n\nTurn 11: action U, y_12=7\n\nTurn 12: action U, y_13=8\n\nTurn 13: action U, y_14=9\n\nAt turn 14: position y_14=9, which is the target.\n\nNow, we have performed actions from turn 4 to 13, that's 10 actions.\n\nTurns 4 to 13 inclusive: 13-4+1=10 actions.\n\nAfter 10 actions, at turn 4 + 10 -1 = 13? Let's see.\n\nAfter k actions, at turn t_1 + k -1? After first action (at turn 4), at turn 5, position set.\n\nAfter actions at turns 4 to m, we have set positions up to y_{m+1}.\n\nAfter actions at turns 4 to 13, we have set y_5 to y_14.\n\ny_14 is set by action at turn 13.\n\nAt turn 14, position y_14=9.\n\nAnd we have performed actions at turns 4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13: that's 10 actions.\n\nNow, the turn when we reach is turn 14, which is t_1 + H -1 =4 + H -1.\n\nSet equal to 14, so 4 + H -1 =14, thus H-1=10, H=11.\n\nBut we have only 10 actions? Contradiction.\n\nI see the mistake.\n\nThe number of actions is H, from turn t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nFor example, if H=1, actions at turn t_1 only, and at turn t_1 +1 -1 = t_1, position should be 9, but we start at y=3, not 9, so H>1.\n\nIn general, after H actions at turns t_1 to t_1+H-1, position at turn t_1 + H -1 is 9.\n\nIn this case, with 10 actions at turns 4 to 13, position at turn 13 is y_13.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 13, action U sets y_14=9, so at turn 14, y=9.\n\nBut turn 14 is t_1 + 10, since 4+10=14.\n\nt_1 + H -1 should be the turn where we are at 9.\n\nHere, at turn 14, we are at 9, so t_1 + H -1 =14.\n\nt_1=4, so 4 + H -1 =14, thus H-1=10, H=11.\n\nBut with 10 actions, we reach at turn 14, which is after 10 actions.\n\nNumber of actions H=10, then t_1 + H -1 =4+10-1=13, but at turn 13, in the sequence, y_13=8, not 9.\n\nAt turn 13, position y_13=8, then action a_13=U sets y_14=9.\n\nSo at turn 14, y_14=9.\n\nTo have y at turn t_1 + H -1 =9.\n\nIf we want at turn 13 y_13=9, but in this path, at turn 13 y_13=8.\n\nTo reach earlier, we need to be at y=9 at an earlier turn.\n\nFor example, if we can be at y=9 at turn 10 or something.\n\nBut in our case, with the obstacles, it takes time.\n\nMinimal H: since we have to avoid τ=2, and go down, it takes extra turns.\n\nSuppose we go down only once, but to where?\n\nAt τ=0, y=3, do D to y=2 at τ=1.\n\nThen at τ=1, y=2, now at τ=2, we need to be safe, so do D to y=1 at τ=2, as before.\n\nIf at τ=1, y=2, we do U to y=3 at τ=2, unsafe.\n\nS, unsafe.\n\nD to y=1, safe.\n\nNo other choice.\n\nSo I think H=11 is minimal.\n\nWith 11 actions, we can have a shorter path? No.\n\nPerhaps at the end, we can reach faster.\n\nAnother idea: since row 1 is occupied at τ=12-15, but in our path, we are not there, so fine.\n\nBut to save, suppose from y=1 at τ=2, we go up, but at some point we can jump, but no.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nSo minimal H is 11.\n\nNow for the sequence:\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 4: D\n\nTurn 5: D\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nWith this, at turn 13, y_13=8 (since from turn 12 action U set y_13=8? Let's list positions.\n\nTurn 4: position y_4=3, action a_4=D, set y_5=2\n\nTurn 5: position y_5=2, action a_5=D, set y_6=1\n\nTurn 6: position y_6=1, action a_6=U, set y_7=2\n\nTurn 7: position y_7=2, action a_7=U, set y_8=3\n\nTurn 8: position y_8=3, action a_8=U, set y_9=4\n\nTurn 9: position y_9=4, action a_9=U, set y_10=5\n\nTurn 10: position y_10=5, action a_10=U, set y_11=6\n\nTurn 11: position y_11=6, action a_11=U, set y_12=7\n\nTurn 12: position y_12=7, action a_12=U, set y_13=8\n\nTurn 13: position y_13=8, action a_13=U, set y_14=9\n\nAt turn 14, position y_14=9.\n\nWe need to reach at turn t_1 + H -1 =14, so H-1=10, H=11.\n\nActions from turn 4 to 13, that's 10 actions, but H=11, so we need one more action or something.\n\nTo reach at turn 13, for example.\n\nBut at turn 13, y_13=8, not 9.\n\nIf we want y_13=9, we need to be at y=9 earlier.\n\nFor example, if no obstacles, from y=3 at turn 4, after 6 U, at turn 10, y_10=9.\n\nBut with obstacles, we have delays.\n\nIn this case, we reached at turn 14.\n\nPerhaps we can have a different path that reaches earlier.\n\nFor example, after being at y=1 at τ=2, we go up faster, but impossible.\n\nOr, we can go to y=0 at τ=2, but worse.\n\nSo I think turn 14 is the earliest.\n\nThus, with H=11, actions as above.\n\nBut in the sequence for H=11, actions at turn 4 to 4+10=14? t from 0 to 10, turns 4+0 to 4+10=14.\n\nAction at turn 14: but at turn 14, if we are at y_14=9, we can set a_14=S to stay, but it's not necessary, but to have H actions.\n\nIn the sequence, we can include the action at turn 14 to stay, but since we already reached, it might be redundant, but to minimize H, we can stop when we reach.\n\nBut in the problem, we need to specify the sequence until we reach.\n\nIn this case, with 10 actions to turn 13, we set y_14=9, so at turn 14 we are at 9.\n\nTo have the position at turn 14 be 9, we need action at turn 13 setting it.\n\nBut for the sequence, with actions at turns 4 to 13 (10 actions), we reach at turn 14.\n\nH such that t_1 + H -1 =14, 4 + H -1=14, H=11.\n\nBut number of actions is 10, which is H-1? Inconsistency.\n\nI think there's a confusion in the definition.\n\nLet's read the problem carefully.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1\"\n\nAnd \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" so there are H actions.\n\nAfter these H actions, at turn t_1 + H -1, position is (0,9).\n\nIn the action sequence, a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, so turns from t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nAfter action at turn t_1 + H -1, the position for the next turn is set, but we need the position at turn t_1 + H -1 to be (0,9).\n\nAt turn T, position y_T, after action a_T, y_{T+1} is set.\n\nWe need y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nFor example, if H=1, actions at turn t_1, and y_{t_1} =9, but we start at 3, not 9.\n\nSo H>1.\n\nIn general, with actions at turns T= t_1 to t_1 + H -1, we determine y_{t_1 +1} to y_{t_1 + H}, but we need y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nSo for turn S = t_1 + H -1, y_S =9.\n\nIn terms of the actions, the last action a_{S} determines y_{S+1}, but we need y_S.\n\ny_S is determined by previous actions.\n\nSpecifically, y_S depends on a_{S-1} and y_{S-1}, etc.\n\nIn our case, to have y_14=9, with t_1=4, S=14, so 4 + H -1 =14, H=11.\n\nActions at turns 4 to 4+11-1=14? Turns from t_1 to t_1+H-1, so for H=11, turns 4 to 4+10=14.\n\nAction at turn 14: but at turn 14, we are at y_14, which should be 9, so we don't need to act, but we must specify an action, or we can choose S to stay.\n\nBut in the sequence, for turn 14, if y_14=9, we can set a_14=S.\n\nBut in our path, with actions up to turn 13, we have y_14=9, so at turn 14, y_14=9, so for the sequence, we can include a_14=S, but it's not necessary, but to have H=11 actions.\n\nSince at turn 14, position is already 9, the action can be anything, but to stay, we set S.\n\nBut in terms of reaching, the action at turn 14 doesn't change the position at turn 14.\n\nTo be consistent, let's include it.\n\nIn the sequence I have 10 actions to turns 13, setting y_14=9.\n\nFor H=11, we need 11 actions, so include action at turn 14.\n\nAt turn 14, position y_14=9, action a_14=S, set y_15=9, but we don't care.\n\nSo the sequence can be:\n\nTurn 4: D\n\nTurn 5: D\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: S\n\nThen at turn 14, position y_14=9, reached.\n\nWith H=11 actions.\n\nIf we don't include the last S, but the problem requires the sequence until we reach, so with 10 actions we reach at turn 14, but the action at turn 13 is the last to set it.\n\nBut to match the definition, with H actions, we reach at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nHere with 11 actions, reach at turn 4+11-1=14.\n\nYes.\n\nNow for the output.\n\nBut in the sequence, all actions are specified.\n\nNow, back to the car at row 1 occupied at τ=12-15, but in this path, at τ=12, global time, τ=12, turn t=4+12=16, but in our path, at τ=12, we are at y=7 or something, not row 1, so fine.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think this is the minimal.\n\nPerhaps we can have a path with H=10, reaching at turn 13.\n\nFor example, if we can be at y=9 at turn 13.\n\nFrom start, min without obstacles: from y=3 at turn 4, to y=9 at turn 10, with 6 ups.\n\nBut with obstacles, we have to go down to y=1 at turn 6 (τ=2), turn 6 is τ=2? τ=0 at turn 4, so turn 6 is τ=2.\n\nAt turn 6, y=1.\n\nThen from there, to y=9 at turn 13: need 8 steps, from turn 6 to turn 13 is 8 turns? From turn 6 to turn 13, positions: at turn 6 y=1, after action U at turn 6, y_7=2 at turn 7, ..., after U at turn 12, y_13=8, after U at turn 13, y_14=9, so at turn 13 y=8, turn 14 y=9.\n\nTo have y_13=9, we need to be at y=9 at turn 13.\n\nFrom y=1 at turn 6, to y=9 at turn 13: 7 steps, min y_13=8 if start from y_6=1, y_7=2, ..., y_13=8.\n\nCannot reach y=9 at turn 13 from there.\n\nIf we start from higher, but we can't.\n\nSo impossible to reach before turn 14.\n\nThus minimal H=11.\n\nNow for the answer.\n\nThe sequence is:\n\nTurn 4: D\n\nTurn 5: D\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: S\n\nBut at turn 14, action S, but we already at y=9, so S is fine.\n\nIn the sequence, the last U at turn 13 sets y_14=9.\n\nThen at turn 14, we can have S.\n\nBut to be precise.\n\nIn the output format, we list the actions.\n\nNow, I think this is correct.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 3)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 4\\), while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), is \\(H = 11\\).

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 6, and the player is at (0,0). The goal is to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on freeways y=1 to 8.\n\n The car update rules: \n   For a left-moving car (d = left): \n        At time t, the car's span is [h, tau] (with h>tau because moving left, so h decreases over time).\n        Then at time T, the span becomes [h - s*(T-t), tau - s*(T-t)].\n\n   For a right-moving car (d = right):\n        The car's span at time t is given as (head, tail) = (h, tau). But note: in the right-moving case, the head is the front (so h>tau) and the car moves to the right.\n        So at time T, the span becomes [tau + s*(T-t), h + s*(T-t)]? Actually, the problem states:\n          Right-moving: [tau, h] becomes [tau + s*(T-t), h + s*(T-t)]? But wait, the initial span is given as (head, tail) and for right-moving the head is the front so the tail is behind. \n\n However, note the example for right-moving: \n        \"Span(t1) = [tau, h] -> Span(T) = [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\"\n\n But in the table, for a right-moving car, the head is given as the larger number? Actually, the problem says:\n        For a right-moving car, the head is the front (so it's the larger coordinate) and the tail is the back (smaller). So the initial span is [tail, head]? \n\n But look at the table: \n        Freeway 1: (-48, -59, right, 3) -> head=-48, tail=-59 -> so the head is larger than tail? Yes, -48 > -59. So the car spans from -59 to -48? \n        Actually, the car is moving right, so at time t1=6, the car occupies [tail, head] = [-59, -48]? \n\n However, the problem states for right-moving: \n        \"Span(t1) = [tau, h]\" and then moves to the right. \n\n So we'll use: \n        For a right-moving car: \n            at time t, the car occupies [tau, h] (with tau < h) and at time T, it occupies [tau + s*(T-t), h + s*(T-t)].\n\n        For a left-moving car (not present in this problem? all are right-moving?): \n            at time t, the car occupies [h, tau] (with h>tau) and at time T, it occupies [h - s*(T-t), tau - s*(T-t)].\n\n But note: the table only has right-moving cars.\n\n Important: Collision occurs at turn T only if the player is on freeway k (i.e., y_T = k) and the car on that freeway has a span that covers 0 at time T.\n\n Also note: the player is only on a freeway at the exact turn when moving. Specifically, if at turn T the player is at position (0, y_T), then we check the cars on freeway y_T at time T.\n\n However, note the rule: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} != y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T\". So at turn T, the player is only on the row y_T.\n\n Steps:\n   We are at turn 6 at (0,0). We can take actions: U (up), D (down), or S (stay). But note: y must be in [0,9]. Since we are at 0, D is not allowed (would go to -1, but it's clamped to 0? Actually, the update says: y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta, and y_{t+1} must be in [0,9]. So if we try to go down from 0, it will stay at 0? Or is it that the move is invalid? Actually, the problem says \"y_{t+1} in [0,9]\", so if we try to go below 0, it would be clamped to 0? But note: the action D from 0: y_{t+1}=0-1=-1 -> but then clamped to 0? The problem doesn't specify clamping. However, the problem says \"y_{t+1} in [0,9]\", so we assume that if the move would take it outside, then it remains at the boundary? But note: the update rule does not specify clamping. However, the condition \"y_{t+1} in [0,9]\" must hold. So we must choose actions that keep it in [0,9]. Therefore, from 0, D is not allowed? Or it would be clamped? \n\n Let me re-read: \"y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t, where ... and y_{t+1} in [0,9]\". This suggests that the move is only valid if the result is in [0,9]. Therefore, from y=0, we cannot do D because that would lead to -1 which is not in [0,9]. Similarly, from y=9, we cannot do U.\n\n Therefore, at y=0, possible actions: U (go to 1) or S (stay at 0).\n\n We are to go from (0,0) at turn 6 to (0,9) as fast as possible.\n\n The obstacles are the cars on freeways 1 to 8 at the time when we are on that freeway.\n\n We note that the cars are moving at constant speeds and we know their positions at turn 6.\n\n We need to compute for each freeway k (from 1 to 8) and for each future turn T (>=6) whether at turn T, if the player is on freeway k, then the car(s) on freeway k (if any) have a span that includes 0 at time T.\n\n Since the cars are moving, we can compute their positions at any future turn.\n\n Let's list the cars:\n\n Freeway 1: one car: (head, tail, direction, speed) = (-48, -59, right, 3)\n   At time t1=6: \n        tail = -59, head = -48 -> the car occupies [ -59, -48 ] at time 6.\n   At time T (>=6): \n        The car moves right at speed 3, so at time T, the car occupies:\n            [ -59 + 3*(T-6), -48 + 3*(T-6) ]\n\n   We need to check when 0 is in [ -59+3*(T-6), -48+3*(T-6) ].\n\n        Solve: -59 + 3*(T-6) <= 0 <= -48 + 3*(T-6)\n\n        => 3*(T-6) >= 59   and 3*(T-6) <= 48? -> but 59>48 so no solution? \n\n        Actually, we have:\n            Lower bound = -59 + 3*(T-6)\n            Upper bound = -48 + 3*(T-6)\n\n        We require: lower_bound <= 0 <= upper_bound.\n\n        So: \n            -59 + 3*(T-6) <= 0   => 3*(T-6) <= 59 -> T-6 <= 59/3 ≈ 19.666 -> T <= 25.666\n            and \n            0 <= -48 + 3*(T-6)   => 3*(T-6) >= 48  => T-6 >= 16 -> T>=22\n\n        So for T in [22, 25] (since T integer: T=22,23,24,25) the car covers 0.\n\n        Therefore, if the player is on freeway 1 at turns 22,23,24,25, then collision.\n\n Freeway 2: (48,37,right,12) -> note: head=48, tail=37? But the problem says for right-moving: the head is the front? So the car spans [37,48] at time 6? \n        At time T: [37+12*(T-6), 48+12*(T-6)]\n\n        Check: 37+12*(T-6) <= 0 <= 48+12*(T-6)\n\n        But note: 37+12*(T-6) is increasing and at T=6: 37>0, so the entire car is to the right of 0? \n        So 0 is never in the interval? \n\n        Actually, the interval is [37+12*(T-6), 48+12*(T-6)] and since 37+12*(T-6) >= 37 (for T>=6) which is >0, so 0 is never in the interval.\n\n        Therefore, freeway 2 is always safe? \n\n Freeway 3: same as freeway 2: (48,37,right,12) -> same analysis: safe.\n\n Freeway 4: same as freeway 2: safe.\n\n Freeway 5: same as freeway 2: safe.\n\n Freeway 6: two cars: \n        Car1: (48,37,right,12) -> same as above: safe.\n        Car2: (0,-11,right,12) -> at time 6: tail=-11, head=0 -> so the car spans [-11,0] at time 6? \n             But note: at time T: [-11+12*(T-6), 0+12*(T-6)] = [-11+12*(T-6), 12*(T-6)]\n\n        We need to check if 0 is in this interval at time T.\n\n            Lower bound: -11+12*(T-6) <= 0 -> 12*(T-6) <= 11 -> T-6 <= 11/12 < 1 -> T<=6.9 -> so only at T=6? \n\n        At T=6: the car spans [-11,0] -> so 0 is included? \n\n        However, note: the player is at (0,0) at turn 6? But the player is on freeway 0 at turn 6? The freeways are from 1 to 8. The player is at y=0 at turn 6, and the freeways are at y=1 to 8. So freeway 6 is at y=6. The player is at y=0, so not on freeway 6 at turn 6. \n\n        Therefore, for freeway 6, the second car at turn 6: the car is at [-11,0] at time 6. But if the player is on freeway 6 at turn T, then we check the cars on freeway 6 at time T.\n\n        For T>6: \n            The car moves: at time T, the car is at [ -11+12*(T-6), 12*(T-6) ]\n\n            We require: -11+12*(T-6) <= 0 <= 12*(T-6)\n\n            The right part: 0 <= 12*(T-6) -> T>=6, which is true.\n\n            The left part: -11+12*(T-6) <= 0 -> 12*(T-6) <= 11 -> T-6 <= 11/12 < 1 -> T <= 6.9 -> so only T=6? \n\n        Therefore, for T>=7, the car is entirely to the right of 0? \n\n        But let's check T=7: \n            [ -11+12*1, 12*1] = [1, 12] -> 0 not in [1,12] -> safe.\n\n        So freeway 6 is safe for T>=7.\n\n Freeway 7: two cars:\n        Car1: (-48,-59,right,6) -> tail=-59, head=-48? \n            At time T: [ -59+6*(T-6), -48+6*(T-6) ]\n\n            We need: -59+6*(T-6) <= 0 <= -48+6*(T-6)\n\n            => 6*(T-6) >= 59   -> T-6 >= ceil(59/6) = ceil(9.833) = 10 -> T>=16\n            and 6*(T-6) <= 48   -> T-6 <= 8 -> T<=14\n\n            But 16>14 -> no solution. So this car never covers 0.\n\n        Car2: (0,-11,right,6) -> at time T: [ -11+6*(T-6), 0+6*(T-6) ] = [ -11+6*(T-6), 6*(T-6) ]\n\n            We need: -11+6*(T-6) <= 0 and 0 <= 6*(T-6)\n\n            The second inequality: T>=6 -> true for T>=6.\n            The first: 6*(T-6) <= 11 -> T-6 <= 11/6 ≈ 1.833 -> T<=7.833 -> so T=6,7.\n\n            At T=6: the car is at [-11,0] -> 0 is included? But note: at turn 6, the player is at y=0, not y=7. So if we are on freeway 7 at turn 6, we would check? But we are at y=0 at turn 6, so not on freeway 7.\n\n            At T=7: [ -11+6, 6] = [-5,6] -> 0 is in [-5,6] -> so if we are on freeway 7 at turn 7, we collide.\n\n            Therefore, freeway 7 is dangerous at turn 7? and also at T=6? but T=6 we are not on it.\n\n            So only at T=7: if we are on freeway 7 at turn 7, we collide.\n\n        Therefore, freeway 7: we must avoid being there at turn 7.\n\n Freeway 8: two cars, same as freeway 7? \n        Car1: (-48,-59,right,6) -> same as above: never covers 0.\n        Car2: (0,-11,right,6) -> same as above: dangerous at T=6 and T=7? \n            At T=6: car is at [-11,0] -> 0 is included -> but we are at y=0 at turn 6, not y=8? so safe for freeway 8 at turn 6? \n            At T=7: car is at [-5,6] -> 0 is included -> so if we are on freeway 8 at turn 7, we collide.\n\n        Therefore, freeway 8: dangerous at turn 7.\n\n Summary of dangerous times for each freeway:\n\n  Freeway 1: T in [22,25] (22,23,24,25) -> avoid being on freeway 1 at these turns.\n  Freeway 2: always safe.\n  Freeway 3: always safe.\n  Freeway 4: always safe.\n  Freeway 5: always safe.\n  Freeway 6: at T=6: dangerous? but we are not on freeway 6 at T=6. For T>=7: safe.\n  Freeway 7: dangerous at T=7 (only turn 7? because at T=8: [ -11+6*2, 12] = [1,12] -> 0 not in [1,12] -> safe for T>=8) \n        So only T=7 is dangerous for freeway 7.\n  Freeway 8: dangerous at T=7 (same as freeway 7: at T=8: [1,12] -> safe) -> only T=7.\n\n Additionally, note that we start at (0,0) at turn 6.\n\n We want to go to (0,9) as fast as possible. The minimal number of moves? \n   Without obstacles, we could go up 9 times: 9 moves. But we have to avoid the dangerous freeways at dangerous times.\n\n Let H be the number of turns (so we start at t=6, then after H-1 moves we are at turn 6+H-1 and we want to be at y=9 at that turn).\n\n We are to output the actions from turn 6 to turn 6+H-1.\n\n We must avoid:\n   On freeway 1: at turns 22,23,24,25 -> if we are on freeway 1 at any of these turns, we crash.\n   On freeway 7: at turn 7 -> we crash if we are on freeway 7 at turn 7.\n   On freeway 8: at turn 7 -> we crash if we are on freeway 8 at turn 7.\n\n Since we start at turn 6 at y=0, and we can only move up (U) or stay (S) at the beginning.\n\n How to get to y=9 as fast as possible? We need at least 9 moves (if we always go up). But we might have to wait sometimes to avoid collisions.\n\n Let me denote the state at turn t (>=6) by (y_t, t). We start at (0,6).\n\n We wish to find the minimal H such that we can be at (9, 6+H-1) without any collision.\n\n Since the grid is small (y in 0..9) and the dangerous events are only at specific turns, we can do a BFS in the state (y,t) or (y, turn) and avoid states that are dangerous.\n\n However, note that the turn can be large? But the dangerous events are bounded: freeway1 only dangerous from 22 to 25, and freeways 7 and 8 only at 7. So we can bound the time.\n\n We are going to simulate the next moves.\n\n We note that we can move at most 1 per turn. So to get from 0 to 9, we need at least 9 moves (turns: 6 to 14? because at turn 6: start at 0, then at turn 7: y1, ..., turn 14: y8? and then at turn 15: y9? but wait: \n\n   Turn 6: y=0 (start)\n   After 1 move (turn 7): y1\n   ...\n   After 9 moves (turn 15): y9.\n\n So minimal H=9 moves? then the sequence would be 9 U's.\n\n But we must avoid being on freeway 7 and 8 at turn 7.\n\n What is freeway 7 and 8? They are y=7 and y=8.\n\n So if we go up without stopping:\n\n   Turn 6: y=0 -> safe (we are at y=0, not freeway 7 or 8)\n   Turn 7: we are at y=1 (because we did U at turn6) -> safe? \n        freeway 7 is y=7, so we are at y=1 -> not on freeway 7 -> safe.\n\n   But wait: at turn 7, we are at y=1 -> we check freeway 1? \n        freeway1 is dangerous at turns 22-25? turn7 is safe.\n\n   Then:\n        turn8: y=2 -> safe\n        turn9: y=3 -> safe\n        turn10: y=4 -> safe\n        turn11: y=5 -> safe\n        turn12: y=6 -> safe (freeway6 is safe for turn12? we saw freeway6 is safe for T>=7, and 12>=7 -> safe)\n        turn13: y=7 -> freeway7: but dangerous only at turn7? turn13 is safe for freeway7? \n        turn14: y=8 -> freeway8: dangerous only at turn7? so safe.\n        turn15: y=9 -> goal.\n\n However, we must check the entire path for collisions:\n\n   We are only on freeway k at turn T if we are at y=k at turn T.\n\n   So for the above path:\n\n        Turn6: y=0 -> no freeway to check (since freeways are 1-8) -> safe.\n        Turn7: y=1 -> check freeway1: \n                freeway1 at turn7: \n                    car: [ -59+3*(7-6), -48+3*(7-6) ] = [ -59+3, -48+3] = [-56, -45] -> 0 not in this -> safe.\n        Turn8: y=2 -> freeway2: \n                car: [37+12*(8-6), 48+12*(8-6)] = [37+24, 48+24] = [61,72] -> safe.\n        Turn9: y=3 -> freeway3: same as freeway2: [37+12*(9-6)=37+36=73, 48+36=84] -> safe.\n        Turn10: y=4 -> freeway4: same -> safe.\n        Turn11: y=5 -> freeway5: same -> safe.\n        Turn12: y=6 -> freeway6: \n                car1: same as freeway2 -> safe? \n                car2: at turn12: [ -11+12*(12-6), 12*(12-6)] = [-11+72, 72] = [61,72] -> safe.\n        Turn13: y=7 -> freeway7: \n                car1: (-48,-59,right,6) at turn13: [ -59+6*(13-6), -48+6*(13-6)] = [-59+42, -48+42] = [-17,-6] -> 0 not in this -> safe.\n                car2: (0,-11,right,6) at turn13: [ -11+6*7, 6*7] = [-11+42,42] = [31,42] -> safe.\n        Turn14: y=8 -> freeway8: \n                car1: same as freeway7 car1: [-59+6*(14-6), -48+6*8] = [-59+48, -48+48] = [-11,0] -> wait, 0 is included? \n                    at T=14: [ -59+6*(14-6) = -59+48 = -11, -48+48=0] -> so the car covers from -11 to 0 -> so 0 is included? \n\n                Therefore, at turn14, if we are on freeway8, we collide.\n\n        So the above naive path fails at turn14 at y=8.\n\n How to avoid? We must not be on freeway8 at turn14? \n\n But note: the dangerous time for freeway8 was only turn7? but that was for the second car? Actually, we have two cars on freeway8: \n        Car1: (-48,-59,right,6) -> we just computed: at turn14: [-11,0] -> covers 0 -> so it is dangerous at turn14? \n\n        We did not analyze freeway8 for turn14? We only analyzed for turn7? \n\n        We must re-analyze freeway8 for any turn T:\n\n        Freeway8 has two cars:\n          Car1: (-48,-59,right,6) -> \n                At time T: [ -59+6*(T-6), -48+6*(T-6) ]\n                We need: -59+6*(T-6) <= 0 <= -48+6*(T-6)\n\n                => 6*(T-6) >= 59 -> T-6 >= ceil(59/6)=10 -> T>=16\n                and 6*(T-6) <= 48 -> T-6<=8 -> T<=14\n\n                So no solution? but wait, at T=14: \n                    lower bound: -59+6*8 = -59+48 = -11\n                    upper bound: -48+48=0\n                    So 0 is in [-11,0]? -> yes, but note the interval is inclusive? \n\n                So actually, we require the car to cover 0 at T=14? \n\n                But the condition: \n                    -11 <= 0 <= 0 -> true.\n\n                So freeway8 is dangerous at T=14? \n\n          Car2: (0,-11,right,6) -> \n                At T=14: [ -11+6*(14-6), 6*(14-6)] = [-11+48, 48] = [37,48] -> 0 not in there.\n\n          So only car1 causes danger at T=14.\n\n        Therefore, we must avoid freeway8 at turn14.\n\n        Also, we already knew that at turn7, freeway8 is dangerous because of car2? \n                At T=7: car2: [ -11+6, 6] = [-5,6] -> covers 0? \n                But note: the car2 at freeway8: at T=7: \n                    [ -11+6*(7-6), 6*(7-6)] = [-11+6, 6] = [-5,6] -> 0 is in [-5,6] -> so dangerous.\n\n        So freeway8 is dangerous at T=7 and T=14.\n\n        Similarly, freeway7: \n          We already knew T=7 was dangerous because of car2? \n          Now check T=14 for freeway7: \n            Car1: [ -59+6*(14-6), -48+6*8] = [-59+48, -48+48] = [-11,0] -> dangerous? \n            Car2: [ -11+6*8, 48] = [37,48] -> safe.\n\n          So freeway7 is dangerous at T=7 and T=14.\n\n        Therefore, we must avoid:\n          Freeway1: T in {22,23,24,25}\n          Freeway7: T in {7,14}\n          Freeway8: T in {7,14}\n\n        And freeway6: we thought it was safe, but let me check T=14 for freeway6:\n          Car1: (48,37,right,12) at T=14: [37+12*(14-6), 48+12*8] = [37+96,48+96]=[133,144] -> safe.\n          Car2: (0,-11,right,12) at T=14: [-11+12*8, 96] = [85,96] -> safe.\n\n        So freeway6 is safe at T=14.\n\n        Also, freeway2,3,4,5: safe at all times.\n\n        Now, what about freeway7 and 8 at other times? \n          For freeway7, car1: we computed that it never covers 0 for T in [16,14]? Actually, we had no solution for the condition? \n          But at T=14: we see it covers [ -11,0] -> so it does cover 0. \n\n          We need to recompute for freeway7 car1: \n                Condition: -59+6*(T-6) <= 0 <= -48+6*(T-6)\n                => 6*(T-6) >= 59 -> T>= ceil(59/6)+6 = 10+6? but 59/6=9.833 -> T>=16? \n                and 6*(T-6) <= 48 -> T<=14.\n\n                So no T in [16,14]? That's impossible. \n\n          Actually, the condition we wrote was for the car covering 0 in the interior? but the car covers 0 at T=14 because the upper bound is 0? \n\n          So the condition should be: \n                lower_bound <= 0 <= upper_bound\n\n          At T=14: \n                lower_bound = -59+6*8 = -11 <=0, and 0<=0 -> true.\n\n          So we must include T=14.\n\n          How to compute the exact times for freeway7 car1? \n                We have: \n                    -59 + 6*(T-6) <= 0   -> 6*(T-6) <= 59 -> T-6 <= 59/6 ≈9.833 -> T<=15.833 -> so T<=15 (integer)\n                    and \n                    0 <= -48+6*(T-6) -> 6*(T-6)>=48 -> T-6>=8 -> T>=14\n\n                So T in [14,15] -> T=14,15.\n\n          Similarly, for freeway8 car1: same -> T=14,15.\n\n          Now freeway7 car2: \n                We had: \n                    [ -11+6*(T-6), 6*(T-6) ]\n                    Condition: -11+6*(T-6) <= 0 <= 6*(T-6)\n                    => 0<=6*(T-6) -> T>=6 (true)\n                    and 6*(T-6)<=11 -> T-6<=11/6≈1.833 -> T<=7.833 -> T=6,7.\n\n          So freeway7: \n                dangerous at T=6? but we start at T=6 at y=0 -> not on freeway7.\n                T=7: dangerous (from car2)\n                T=14: dangerous (from car1)\n                T=15: dangerous (from car1)\n\n          Similarly, freeway8:\n                car1: dangerous at T=14,15\n                car2: dangerous at T=6,7\n                So dangerous at T=6 (but we are not at freeway8 at T=6), T=7,14,15.\n\n        Therefore, update:\n\n          Freeway1: T in [22,25] -> T=22,23,24,25\n          Freeway7: T in {7,14,15}\n          Freeway8: T in {7,14,15}\n\n        And freeway6: safe for T>=7.\n\n Now, let's try to plan:\n\n   We want to go from y=0 at T=6 to y=9 at T=6+H-1.\n\n   Minimal H: 9 moves -> T=6 to 14 (because after 9 moves we are at T=15: \n        T6: move0: start at 0\n        T7: move1: y=?\n        ...\n        T15: move9: y=?\n\n        So at T=15, we are at y=9.\n\n        But note: at T=15, we are at freeway9? There is no freeway9? The freeways are 1-8. So when we are at y=9, we don't check any freeway? -> safe.\n\n        So the goal is safe.\n\n   However, we must avoid being on freeway7 and 8 at T=7,14,15 and freeway1 at T=22,23,24,25.\n\n   Since T=15 is our goal time, we are at y=9 -> safe.\n\n   The problem: at T=14, we must not be on freeway7 or 8? \n\n        In the naive path: at T=14 we are at y=8 -> freeway8 -> dangerous.\n\n        So we must avoid being at y=8 at T=14.\n\n        How can we adjust?\n\n        Option 1: slow down so that we are at y=8 at a different time? \n        Option 2: skip T=14 at freeway8 by being at a different y at T=14.\n\n        Since we are at T=13: we are at y=7 in the naive path? \n          At T=13: y=7 -> freeway7: \n                Check freeway7 at T=13: \n                  car1: [-59+6*(13-6), -48+6*7] = [-59+42, -48+42] = [-17,-6] -> safe.\n                  car2: [-11+6*7,42] = [31,42] -> safe.\n                So safe.\n\n          Then at T=14: we would go from y=7 to y=8 -> but then at T=14 we are at y=8 -> dangerous.\n\n        So we must avoid moving up from y=7 to y=8 at T=14? \n\n        Instead, we can stay at y=7 at T=14? \n          Then at T=14: y=7 -> freeway7: dangerous? because T=14 is dangerous for freeway7 -> so we cannot stay at y=7 at T=14.\n\n        Then we can go down? but from y=7 we can go down to y=6? \n          Then at T=14: y=6 -> freeway6: safe (as we computed).\n\n          Then at T=15: we can go from y=6 to y=7? \n                But at T=15: y=7 -> freeway7: dangerous (T=15 is dangerous) -> so we cannot go to y=7 at T=15.\n\n        Alternatively, from T=14 at y=6, we can go up to y=7 at T=15? but then we are at y=7 at T=15 -> dangerous.\n\n        Or we can go up to y=8 at T=15? \n                At T=15: y=8 -> freeway8: dangerous (T=15) -> also dangerous.\n\n        So that doesn't work.\n\n        We must avoid being at freeway7 and 8 at T=14 and T=15? \n\n        What if we slow down earlier? \n\n        We are at T=12: y=6 (safe) -> at T=13: we could stay at y=6? \n                Then T=13: y=6 -> safe.\n                T=14: we can still stay at y=6? \n                Then T=14: y=6 -> safe.\n                T=15: then we need to go to y=9? but that's 3 moves: \n                        15: y=6 -> 7\n                        16: y=8\n                        17: y=9 -> then we are at y=9 at T=17? which is after 11 moves.\n\n        That is H=11? which is not minimal.\n\n        Alternatively, at T=13: we go to y=7 (safe at T=13) and then at T=14 we cannot stay at y=7 (dangerous) and cannot go to y=8 (dangerous) -> so we must go down to y=6 at T=14? \n                Then T=14: y=6 -> safe.\n                Then T=15: we can go up: to y=7? -> but T=15: freeway7 is dangerous -> not allowed.\n\n        So we are stuck.\n\n        What if we are at T=12: not at y=6? \n\n        We need to be at y=9 at T=15. \n\n        Let me denote the positions at each turn:\n\n          T6: y=0\n          T7: y=?\n          T8: y=?\n          ...\n          T15: y=9\n\n        We must have the total moves up = 9 - (any moves down) = 9? because we start at 0 and end at 9? Actually, any down move must be compensated by an up move? so the net is 9.\n\n        The minimal number of moves is 9, but we might have to wait (stay) or even go down? so the total moves might be more than 9? \n\n        We are allowed to take more than 9 moves.\n\n        How about:\n\n          We want to avoid being at y=7 or 8 at T=14 and T=15.\n\n          So at T=14 and T=15, we must be at y<=6 or y=9? \n\n          But note: we are at T=15 at the goal y=9, so we are safe at T=15 (since y=9 not a freeway).\n\n          So we only worry about T=14: we must be at y not in {7,8} at T=14.\n\n          We can be at y=6 at T=14? and then at T=15 we go to y=7, then T=16 to y=8, T=17 to y=9? -> total moves: 11 moves.\n\n          But we might be able to be at y=9 at T=15? if we can avoid y=8 at T=14? \n\n          How? \n\n          We are at T=13: we must be at y=7? because to get to y=9 at T=15, we need two moves: \n                T14: y=8, T15: y=9 -> but then at T=14 we are at y=8 -> dangerous.\n\n          So we must be at T=13 at y=8? \n                Then T14: y=9 -> but then we are at y=9 at T=14 -> safe (since no freeway at y=9) -> then we are done at T=14? \n\n          But that would be 8 moves: \n                T6:0 -> T7:1 -> ... -> T13:7? and then T14:8? but wait, to be at y=8 at T=13: \n                from T6 to T13: that's 7 moves, so we must have moved up 7 times? then y=7 at T13? \n\n          Actually: \n                T6:0\n                T7:1 (after 1 move)\n                T8:2\n                T9:3\n                T10:4\n                T11:5\n                T12:6\n                T13:7 -> so at T13 we are at y=7.\n\n          Then to be at y=8 at T=13: we must have started at y=7 at T=12 and then moved up at T=12? \n\n          But at T=12: we were at y=6 (from T6 to T12: 6 moves -> y=6) then at T=12: we move up to y=7? -> T13: we are at y=7.\n\n          How to be at y=8 at T=13? we would have to be at y=7 at T=12 and then move up at T=12 to y=8 at T=13? -> then T13: y=8.\n\n          So the path:\n\n            T6:0 -> U: T7:1\n            T7:1 -> U: T8:2\n            T8:2 -> U: T9:3\n            T9:3 -> U: T10:4\n            T10:4 -> U: T11:5\n            T11:5 -> U: T12:6 -> then at T12: we are at y=6. Then we do U: T13:7 -> then U: T14:8 -> dangerous at T14.\n\n          Alternatively, at T12: we do U -> T13:7, then at T13: we do U -> T14:8 -> dangerous.\n\n          How to be at y=8 at T=13? we would have to have been at y=7 at T=12, then U at T12 -> y=8 at T13.\n\n          So at T12: we are at y=7? \n\n          How to be at y=7 at T=12? \n                T6:0 -> T7:1 -> T8:2 -> T9:3 -> T10:4 -> T11:5 -> T12:6 -> then we need to get to y=7 at T12? impossible because at T12 we are at y=6.\n\n          We must have moved faster? but we can only move one per turn.\n\n        Therefore, we cannot be at y=8 at T=13. The earliest we can be at y=8 is T14: starting from T6, 8 moves: \n                T6:0\n                T7:1\n                T8:2\n                T9:3\n                T10:4\n                T11:5\n                T12:6\n                T13:7\n                T14:8\n\n        And then T15:9.\n\n        So we must avoid being at y=8 at T=14? \n\n        The only way is to not be at y=8 at T=14. So we have to be at y<8 at T=14? then we are behind schedule.\n\n        Then we need extra moves.\n\n        So minimal H might be 10? then we finish at T=15: y=9 (safe) and we avoid the dangerous T=14 at y=8.\n\n        How? \n\n          We can be at y=7 at T=14? -> but freeway7 at T=14 is dangerous -> not allowed.\n\n          Or y=6 at T=14? safe.\n\n          Then at T=15: we go from y=6 to y=7 -> but freeway7 at T=15 is dangerous -> not allowed.\n\n          Or from y=6 at T=14: \n                T15: U to y=7 -> dangerous (freeway7 at T=15)\n                T15: UU? no, only one move per turn.\n\n          So we must wait at y=6 for two turns? \n                T14: y=6\n                T15: y=6 (by staying) -> then at T=15: freeway6? \n                        freeway6 at T=15: \n                          car1: [37+12*(15-6)=37+108=145, 48+108=156] -> safe.\n                          car2: [-11+12*9= -11+108=97, 108] -> safe.\n\n                Then T16: U to y=7 -> but freeway7 at T=16: \n                          car1: [-59+6*10, -48+60] = [1,12] -> safe? \n                          car2: [-11+6*10,60] = [49,60] -> safe.\n                T17: U to y=8 -> freeway8 at T=17: \n                          car1: [-59+6*11, -48+66] = [7,18] -> safe? \n                          car2: [-11+6*11,66] = [55,66] -> safe.\n                T18: U to y=9 -> goal.\n\n          So that takes 12 moves? \n\n        Alternatively, we might find a path that avoids the dangerous freeways at dangerous times by waiting at safe freeways.\n\n        Let me try to avoid freeway8 at T=14 by being at a safe freeway at T=14, and then catch up.\n\n        We are at T=13: we can be at y=7? (safe at T=13) -> then at T=14 we must not be at y=7 or 8? -> so we can only go to y=6 or stay? but staying is dangerous.\n\n        So go down to y=6 at T=14: safe.\n\n        Then at T=15: we want to go up? but we cannot go to y=7 (dangerous at T=15). \n\n        So we must wait at y=6 for T=15: safe.\n\n        Then at T=16: \n                go to y=7: freeway7 at T=16: \n                    car1: [-59+6*10=1, -48+60=12] -> safe.\n                    car2: [-11+60=49,60] -> safe.\n                T17: go to y=8: freeway8 at T=17: \n                    car1: [-59+6*11= -59+66=7, -48+66=18] -> safe.\n                    car2: [-11+66=55,66] -> safe.\n                T18: go to y=9.\n\n        Total moves: 12 moves (from T6 to T18, but note we are counting the actions: 12 actions? \n                T6: move0 -> T7: y1\n                ...\n                T18: y12? \n\n        We start at T6 at y0.\n        After 12 moves: we are at T6+12 = T18, and y=9.\n\n        So H=12.\n\n        But can we do better?\n\n        What if we are at y=5 at T=13? \n          Then at T=14: we can go to y=6 (safe) or y=5 (stay) or y=4 (down)? \n          Then at T=15: from y=6 we can only stay (since going up to 7 is dangerous) -> so we are stuck.\n\n        Alternatively, we might try to be at y=9 earlier by taking a different route? \n\n        But we must avoid freeway1 at T=22-25? and we are finishing at T=18 (if we take 12 moves) which is before 22, so freeway1 is not an issue.\n\n        However, we are currently only worried about freeway7 and 8 at T=14,15.\n\n        Can we finish in 10 moves? (so at T=15: y=9)\n\n          How? \n            T6:0\n            T7:1\n            T8:2\n            T9:3\n            T10:4\n            T11:5\n            T12:6\n            T13:7 -> safe? (freeway7 at T=13: safe as computed)\n            T14:8 -> dangerous (freeway8 at T=14: car1 covers 0) -> not allowed.\n\n        Can we be at y=9 at T=14? \n          That requires: from T6 to T14: 8 moves, so we need to move up 9 in 8 moves? impossible.\n\n        So minimal moves might be 12? \n\n        But let me see if we can do it in 11 moves:\n\n          We want to be at y=9 at T=16 (because 6+11-1=16).\n\n          Then the path:\n\n            T6:0\n            T7:1\n            T8:2\n            T9:3\n            T10:4\n            T11:5\n            T12:6\n            T13:7 -> safe\n            T14: ? \n\n          At T14: we cannot be at y=7 or 8 -> so we must be at y=6 or below? \n\n          But we are at T13: y=7. So at T13 we must move down to y=6 at T14? -> safe.\n          T15: we cannot go to y=7 (dangerous) -> so we must stay at y=6? or move down? \n          T15: if we stay at y=6: safe.\n          T16: then we move: \n                T16: y=7 (safe? freeway7 at T=16: safe) \n                then we need to be at y=9 at T=16? -> we can only do one move: to y=8? \n                then at T=16: we are at y=8? freeway8 at T=16: \n                    car1: [-59+6*10=1, -48+60=12] -> safe? \n                    car2: [-11+60=49,60] -> safe.\n                but we are at y=8, not y=9.\n\n          So we need T17: to y=9.\n\n          That would be 11 moves: \n                moves: 11 actions -> from T6 to T16: 11 moves? \n                T6: move0 -> T7\n                ...\n                T16: move10 -> then we are at T16, and we need one more move at T16 to get to T17? \n\n          Actually, after k moves, we are at turn 6+k.\n\n          We want to be at y=9 at turn 6+H-1, and we have H moves.\n\n          So if H=11, then we are at turn 6+11-1 = 16.\n\n          But at T16, we are at y=8 (from above) -> not goal.\n\n          Then we need an extra move: H=12.\n\n        Therefore, minimal H=12.\n\n        The plan:\n\n          T6 (move0): start at y=0 -> action: U (to y=1) [we could also do S, but we want to move up]\n          T7: y=1 -> U (to y=2)\n          T8: y=2 -> U (to y=3)\n          T9: y=3 -> U (to y=4)\n          T10: y=4 -> U (to y=5)\n          T11: y=5 -> U (to y=6)\n          T12: y=6 -> U (to y=7) -> at T12: freeway7? but T12 is not dangerous (dangerous at 7,14,15) -> safe.\n          T13: y=7 -> D (down to y=6) [because we don't want to be at y=7 or 8 at T14] \n          T14: y=6 -> S (stay) [because we cannot go to y=7 at T14: dangerous, and we don't want to go down? but we can stay]\n          T15: y=6 -> S (stay) [because at T15, freeway7 and 8 are dangerous, but we are at freeway6 -> safe, and we cannot go up to 7 because dangerous]\n          T16: y=6 -> U (to y=7) [freeway7 at T16: safe]\n          T17: y=7 -> U (to y=8) [freeway8 at T17: safe]\n          T18: y=8 -> U (to y=9) [goal]\n\n        But note: at T18 we are at y=9, and the turn is 6+12 = 18? \n\n        How many moves? \n          moves: T6 to T18: 12 moves? \n          We start at T6 and make 12 moves: \n            T6: action0 -> T7: y1\n            T7: action1 -> T8: y2\n            ...\n            T17: action11 -> T18: y9\n\n          So we have 12 actions.\n\n        But is there a way to do it in fewer? \n\n        What if at T13: we go down to y=6 (as above) then at T14: we go down to y=5? \n          Then T15: we can go up? \n                T15: from y=5 to y=6: safe (freeway6 at T15: safe)\n                T16: y=6 to y=7: safe (freeway7 at T16: safe)\n                T17: y=7 to y=8: safe\n                T18: y=8 to y=9: safe.\n\n          That is also 12 moves.\n\n        Or if we go down more? doesn't help.\n\n        What if we wait earlier? \n\n          For example, at T7: we stay at y=0? \n          But then we are behind.\n\n          We might avoid freeway8 at T=14 by being at y=8 at a different time? but we are constrained to move one per turn.\n\n        Therefore, we go with 12 moves.\n\n        Now, we must check every step for collisions:\n\n          T6: (0,0) -> safe (not on freeway)\n          T7: (0,1) -> freeway1: \n                  car: at T7: [-59+3, -48+3] = [-56,-45] -> safe.\n          T8: (0,2) -> freeway2: [37+12*2,48+24]=[61,72] -> safe.\n          T9: (0,3) -> freeway3: same as freeway2 -> safe.\n          T10: (0,4) -> freeway4: same -> safe.\n          T11: (0,5) -> freeway5: same -> safe.\n          T12: (0,6) -> freeway6: \n                  car1: [37+12*6,48+72]=[37+72,120]=[109,120] -> safe.\n                  car2: [-11+12*6,72]=[-11+72,72]=[61,72] -> safe.\n          T13: (0,7) -> freeway7: \n                  car1: [-59+6*7, -48+42]=[-59+42, -6]=[-17,-6] -> safe.\n                  car2: [-11+6*7,42]=[-11+42,42]=[31,42] -> safe.\n          T14: (0,6) -> freeway6: \n                  T14: freeway6: \n                    car1: [37+12*8,48+96]=[37+96,144]=[133,144] -> safe.\n                    car2: [-11+12*8,96]=[-11+96,96]=[85,96] -> safe.\n          T15: (0,6) -> freeway6: same as T14?

We take actions: \n                a_{t1} -> then at turn t1+1: we are at y1.\n                a_{t1+1} -> then at turn t1+2: y2.\n                ...\n                a_{t1+H-1} -> then at turn t1+H: we are at y_H.\n\n          But we want at turn t1+H-1: we are at (0,9). \n\n          That means that at turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9), and we haven't taken the last action? \n\n          This is confusing.\n\n          Let me re-read: \n                \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" \n                and we start at turn t1.\n\n          So the actions are taken at turns: t1+0, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\n          The state at the beginning of turn t1 is (0,0). \n          Then we take action a_{t1} and move to state (0, y_{t1+1}) at the beginning of turn t1+1? \n\n          But the problem says: \n                \"y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t\"\n\n          So after action at turn t, the next state is at turn t+1.\n\n          Therefore, after the last action at turn t1+H-1, we are at state (0, y_{t1+H}) at turn t1+H.\n\n          But we want to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1? \n\n          That would be the state at the beginning of turn t1+H-1.\n\n          How do we get there? \n                We start at turn t1: (0,0)\n                After action a_{t1}: we are at turn t1+1: y1.\n                ...\n                After action a_{t1+H-2}: we are at turn t1+H-1: y_{H-1}.\n\n          So we want y_{H-1} = 9 at turn t1+H-1.\n\n          Therefore, the last action is taken at turn t1+H-2? \n\n          But the sequence of actions is from t1 to t1+H-1: that would be H actions? \n\n          This doesn't match.\n\n          Let me see the answer format: \n                Turn t1: a_{t1}\n                Turn t1+1: a_{t1+1}\n                ...\n                Turn t1+H-1: a_{t1+H-1}\n\n          and then at turn t1+H-1 we take the last action, and then we are at turn t1+H.\n\n          But the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\" meaning at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 we are at (0,9)? \n\n          That would be before taking any action at turn t1+H-1.\n\n          How do we get to (0,9) at the beginning of turn t1+H-1? \n                We start at turn t1: (0,0) [beginning of turn t1]\n                Then we take action a_{t1}: and move to (0,y1) at turn t1+1.\n\n          So to be at (0,9) at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we need to have taken H-2 actions? \n\n          I think there is a confusion in the indexing.\n\n          The problem states: \n                \"Find a sequence of actions ... such that ... at turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9)\"\n\n          and the actions are taken at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1? \n\n          But if we take an action at turn t, it affects the next state at turn t+1.\n\n          Therefore, to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1, we must have gotten there by the action at turn t1+H-2? \n\n          And then we take an extra action at turn t1+H-1? which we don't care about? \n\n          But the problem says we are to reach at turn t1+H-1, so we don't need to take an action at turn t1+H-1? \n\n          This is not matching.\n\n          Let me read carefully: \n                \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\"\n\n          So the sequence has H actions, indexed from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\n          The state after the entire sequence is at turn t1+H? \n\n          But we want to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1.\n\n          How can we achieve that? \n                We start at turn t1: (0,0)\n                After action a_{t1}: at turn t1+1: y1\n                ...\n                After action a_{t1+H-2}: at turn t1+H-1: y_{H-1}\n\n          We want y_{H-1}=9.\n\n          So the last action that matters is at turn t1+H-2.\n\n          But the sequence includes an extra action at turn t1+H-1? \n\n          The problem says the sequence has H actions, so we output H actions? \n\n          And then we are at turn t1+H, but we only care about being at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1.\n\n          But note: at turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9), and then we take an action a_{t1+H-1} which may move us away? \n\n          The problem doesn't say we stop. It says \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\". \n\n          So we must be at (0,9) at the beginning of turn t1+H-1? \n                Then we take an action a_{t1+H-1} at that turn, and then we move to y_{t1+H} which might not be 9.\n\n          But the goal is only to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1, not necessarily to stay.\n\n          So we can have a_{t1+H-1} be any action? \n\n          However, the minimal H should be the minimal such that we can be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1, and then we output H actions.\n\n          But note: if we are at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1, then we have taken H-1 actions? \n                actions: at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-2: total H-1 actions.\n\n          But the problem says the sequence has H actions: t=0 to H-1, so t1 to t1+H-1.\n\n          This implies that we output one extra action.\n\n          This is confusing.\n\n          Let me try with a small example: \n                Suppose we start at (0,0) at turn 6, and we want to be at (0,0) at turn 6 (with H=1?).\n\n          Then the sequence: \n                {a_{6+0}} -> one action at turn 6.\n                and then at turn 6+1-1 = 6, we are at (0,0) -> so we haven't moved.\n\n          How? \n                We start at turn 6: (0,0). \n                We take action a_6: if we do S, then at turn 7: we are at (0,0)? \n                But we want to be at (0,0) at turn 6.\n\n          So it seems that the state at the beginning of turn 6 is (0,0). We haven't taken any action yet.\n\n          Then we take actions at turn 6,7,..., and we want that at the beginning of turn 6+H-1, we are at (0,9).\n\n          Therefore, we need to take actions at turns 6,7,...,6+H-2 to get to (0,9) at the beginning of turn 6+H-1.\n\n          And then we take one more action at turn 6+H-1? \n\n          But the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\" (which is 6+H-1) and we are to output H actions.\n\n          So the first action is at turn 6, and the last at turn 6+H-1.\n\n          And the effect: after the action at turn 6, we are at turn 7: y1.\n          ... \n          after the action at turn 6+H-2, we are at turn 6+H-1: y_{H-1} = 9.\n          then we take an action at turn 6+H-1: which moves us to y_{H} at turn 6+H.\n\n          But we don't care about that.\n\n          So in our plan, we want to be at y=9 at turn 6+H-1.\n\n          How many actions have been taken when we are at turn 6+H-1? \n                We took actions at turns: 6,7,...,6+H-2 -> that's H-1 actions.\n\n          But the sequence requires H actions? \n\n          This is a discrepancy.\n\n          I think there is a off-by-one.\n\n          Let me read the problem again: \n                \"minimal number of turns H\" and \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\"\n\n          and the actions are for turns t1 to t1+H-1.\n\n          So to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1, we need to have taken actions at turns t1 to t1+H-2? \n\n          But the sequence includes an action at turn t1+H-1.\n\n          And the minimal H is the minimal number such that we can be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1 by taking actions at turns t1 to t1+H-2, and then we have to take an extra action at turn t1+H-1.\n\n          But the problem doesn't say we have to take that extra action to be at 9, only that we output H actions.\n\n          So in our case, we want to be at (0,9) at turn 6+H-1.\n\n          How many moves does it take to get from 0 to 9? at least 9 moves (actions) -> then H-1 = 9 -> H=10.\n\n          But then we output 10 actions: the first 9 actions are to get to 9, and the 10th action can be arbitrary? \n\n          However, the problem says \"avoid collisions\", and at turn 6+H-1 we are at (0,9) and then we take an action at turn 6+H-1, which will move us to either y=8,9, or 10 (but clamped to 9) or stay at 9.\n\n          But if we are at 9 at turn 6+H-1, and then we take action U, we try to go to 10, which is clamped to 9? so we stay at 9.\n\n          Or if we take D, we go to 8.\n\n          Or S, we stay.\n\n          But the goal is only to be at 9 at turn 6+H-1, not to stay.\n\n          So the extra action doesn't affect the condition.\n\n          However, we must avoid collisions at turn 6+H-1 when we are at (0,9) and then take the action? \n\n          But at (0,9), there is no freeway (since freeways are 1-8), so safe.\n\n          Then the action at turn 6+H-1: after the action, we move to a new state at turn 6+H, but we don't care.\n\n          Therefore, we can choose any action for the last one.\n\n          So minimal H: we need at least 9 actions to move from 0 to 9? so H-1>=9 -> H>=10.\n\n          But in our earlier plan with 12 actions, we are at 9 at turn 6+12-1 = 6+11=17? -> turn 17.\n\n          How many actions? 12 actions.\n\n          And we are at 9 at turn 17, which is t1+H-1=6+12-1=17.\n\n          So that matches.\n\n          But can we do it in 10 actions? \n                We want to be at 9 at turn 6+10-1 = 15.\n                How? \n                  We start at turn6:0\n                  We take 9 actions of U: \n                          turn6: U -> turn7:1\n                          ...\n                          turn14: U -> turn15:9\n\n                So at turn15 (which is 6+10-1=15), we are at 9.\n\n                But we must avoid collisions.\n\n                Check the path:\n\n                  T6:0 -> safe.\n                  T7:1 -> freeway1: safe (car at [-56,-45])\n                  T8:2 -> freeway2: safe\n                  T9:3 -> freeway3: safe\n                  T10:4 -> freeway4: safe\n                  T11:5 -> freeway5: safe\n                  T12:6 -> freeway6: safe\n                  T13:7 -> freeway7: safe (at T13: [-17,-6] and [31,42])\n                  T14:8 -> freeway8: at T14: car1: [-11,0] -> covers 0?

then we would be at y=8 at turn15? \n                        turn15: y=8 -> freeway8: dangerous at T15? \n                        freeway8 at T15: \n                            car1: [-59+6*9, -48+54] = [-59+54, 6] = [-5,6] -> covers 0?

\n                                We are at turn15: we must be at y=7 or 8 or 9? \n                                To be at y=8 at turn16, we must have been at y=7 or 8 or 9 at turn15.\n\n                        But we want to be at y=9 at turn15? \n\n                So we cannot be at y=9 at turn15 with 10 actions because we are at y=8 at turn14 and that is dangerous.\n\n                Therefore, 10 actions won't work.\n\n                Next, try H=11: \n                        turn at which we are at 9: 6+11-1=16.\n                        Actions: 11 actions, then at turn16: y=9.\n                        We need to be at y=9 at turn16.\n\n                        How to get there without being in danger?

-> freeway8 at T16: safe, then to y=9 at T17? -> but we need to be at y=9 at T16.\n\n                        Alternatively, from T14: if we are at y=6, then T15: we go to y=7 (dangerous) or y=6 (safe) or y=5 (safe).\n                        Then T16: from y=6: we can go to y=7 (safe at T16) but then we are at y=7 at T16, not 9.\n\n                        So we cannot reach y=9 at T16 with only two moves from T14 to T16 if we are at y=6 at T14.\n\n                Therefore, we need to be at least at y=7 at T14 to have a chance to be at y=9 at T16: \n                         T14: y=7 (dangerous) -> not allowed.\n\n                So H=11 also doesn't work.\n\n                Then H=12: \n                        goal at turn 6+12-1=17.\n                        We have a plan that gets to y=9 at turn17.\n\n                And we already have a plan for 12 actions.\n\n        So minimal H=12.\n\n        The actions for turns 6 to 17 (12 actions):\n\n          turn6: U\n          turn7: U\n          turn8: U\n          turn9: U\n          turn10: U\n          turn11: U\n          turn12: U\n          turn13: D\n          turn14: S\n          turn15: S\n          turn16: U\n          turn17: U\n\n        But wait, at turn17: we are at y=8 (from turn16: y=7, then U to y=8 at turn17) and then we need to be at y=9 at turn17? \n                We are at turn17: state (0,8) at the beginning of turn17.\n                Then we take action a_{17} (which is the 12th action) -> then at turn18: we will be at y=9.\n\n        But we want to be at y=9 at turn17 (the beginning) -> we are not.\n\n        In our plan above, we are at y=8 at turn17.\n\n        How to be at y=9 at turn17? \n                We must have been at y=8 or 9 or 10 at turn16, and then moved to y=9 at turn17? \n                But from y=8: U -> y=9.\n                So if at turn16 we are at y=8, then at turn16 we do U -> turn17: y=9.\n\n        In our plan, at turn16 we are at y=7 -> then we do U at turn16 to become y=8 at turn17.\n\n        So to be at y=9 at turn17, we need to be at y=8 at turn16.\n\n        How to be at y=8 at turn16? \n                turn16: freeway8 at turn16: \n                  car1: [1,12] -> safe.\n                so we can be at y=8 at turn16.\n\n        Then we do U at turn16: to y=9 at turn17.\n\n        So let's adjust the plan to be at y=8 at turn16:\n\n          We start:\n            T6:0 -> U: T7:1\n            T7:1 -> U: T8:2\n            T8:2 -> U: T9:3\n            T9:3 -> U: T10:4\n            T10:4 -> U: T11:5\n            T11:5 -> U: T12:6\n            T12:6 -> U: T13:7\n            T13:7 -> D: T14:6   [to avoid being at y=7 or 8 at T14]\n            T14:6 -> S: T15:6\n            T15:6 -> U: T16:7   [at T15: safe at freeway6; at T16: freeway7: safe]\n            But we want to be at y=8 at turn16? so we need one more move.\n\n          How to get to y=8 at turn16? \n                From T15: y=6, we can go U to y=7 at T16, but not to 8.\n\n          So we need to leave earlier.\n\n          What if at T14: we do not stay at y=6, but go up to y=7? \n                T14: from y=6 to y=7 -> then at T14: we are at y=7 -> freeway7: dangerous at T14 -> not allowed.\n\n          Or at T15: we go U twice? no, one move per turn.\n\n        Alternatively, we can be at y=8 at turn16 by:\n\n          T6:0->1\n          T7:1->2\n          T8:2->3\n          T9:3->4\n          T10:4->5\n          T11:5->6\n          T12:6->7\n          T13:7->6  (D)\n          T14:6->7  (U)  [at T14: freeway7: dangerous -> not allowed]\n\n        Or:\n\n          T13:7->6\n          T14:6->7 (not allowed)\n          T15:7->8 (not allowed because freeway7 at T15 is dangerous and freeway8 at T15 is dangerous)\n\n        How about:\n\n          T13: we do not go down, but stay at 7? \n                T13:7->7 (S) -> then at T13: we are at y=7 (safe) and at T14: we are still at y=7 -> dangerous.\n\n        Or go up to 8 at T13? \n                T13:7->8: then at T13: freeway7: safe, then at T14: we are at y=8 -> freeway8: dangerous at T14.\n\n        So we cannot be at y=8 at T16 without going through a dangerous state.\n\n        Therefore, we must use two moves from T16 and T17 to get from y=7 to y=9? \n\n        But then we are at y=9 at T18, not T17.\n\n        So to be at y=9 at T17, we must be at y=8 at T16.\n\n        And to be at y=8 at T16, we must have been at y=7 at T15 and then moved up at T15 to y=8 at T16? \n                But at T15: freeway7 is dangerous -> we cannot be at y=7 at T15.\n\n        Or at y=8 at T15 and then stay? \n                T15: y=8 -> freeway8: dangerous at T15.\n\n        So it's impossible to be at y=8 at T16 without being in a dangerous state at T15 or earlier.\n\n        Therefore, we cannot achieve being at y=9 at T17 with 12 actions.\n\n        We must be at y=9 at T18.\n\n        In our plan, we are at y=8 at T17 and then we do U at T17 to get to y=9 at T18.\n\n        And we want to be at y=9 at turn t1+H-1 = 6+H-1.\n\n        So 6+H-1 = 18 -> H=13.\n\n        But we only took 12 actions? \n\n        Let me count the turns:\n\n          Actions at turns: 6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17 -> 12 actions -> H=12.\n          Then the turn at which we are at the goal is turn 6+12 = 18? \n          But the problem says we want to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1 = 6+12-1 = 17.\n\n        This off-by-one is very confusing.\n\n        Let me redefine:\n\n          Let t be the turn index.\n          At the beginning of turn t, we are at state (0, y_t).\n\n          We then choose an action a_t.\n          This updates the state: y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta(a_t).\n\n          So after the action at turn t, the next state is at turn t+1.\n\n          We start at turn t1=6: state (0,0).\n\n          We take actions at turns: 6, 6+1, 6+2, ..., 6+H-1.\n\n          Then the state at the beginning of turn 6+H is y_{6+H} = ... \n\n          But we want the state at the beginning of turn 6+H-1 to be (0,9).\n\n          So we require: after actions at turns 6,7,...,6+H-2, we have that at turn 6+H-1 we are at (0,9).\n\n          Then we take an action at turn 6+H-1, and then we are at turn 6+H: which is not the goal turn.\n\n          Therefore, the number of actions to reach the goal is (H-1) actions? \n                actions: turns 6 to 6+H-2: that's (6+H-2) - 6 + 1 = H-1 actions.\n\n          But the problem says the sequence has H actions.\n\n          So we must output H actions, but only the first H-1 are needed to reach the goal at turn 6+H-1, and the last action is taken at turn 6+H-1 after we are already at the goal.\n\n          So in our case, we need to reach (0,9) at turn 6+H-1.\n\n          How many actions are required to move from 0 to 9? at least 9 actions (H-1>=9 -> H>=10).\n\n          In our adjusted plan, we want to be at (0,9) at turn 17: \n                6+H-1 = 17 -> H=12.\n\n          So we need 12 actions, and we will be at (0,9) at the beginning of turn 17.\n\n          How? \n                We take actions at turns 6 to 17 (12 actions).\n\n          But then the state at turn17 is after 12 actions? \n                action0 at turn6 -> turn7: state1\n                ...\n                action11 at turn17 -> turn18: state12.\n\n          So at the beginning of turn17, we haven't taken the 11th action? \n\n          Let me index the state at the beginning of the turn:\n\n                turn6: state0 = 0\n                after action0 at turn6: state1 at turn7.\n                after action1 at turn7: state2 at turn8.\n                ...\n                after action11 at turn17: state12 at turn18.\n\n          We want state at the beginning of turn17 to be 9.\n\n          That is, before taking any action at turn17, we are at 9.\n\n          How many actions have been taken to get to that state? \n                actions at turns6 to turn16: that's 11 actions.\n\n          So we need 11 actions to get to (0,9) at turn17.\n\n          Then we take one more action at turn17 (which is the 12th action) -> and then we are at turn18.\n\n          Therefore, H=12.\n\n          The actions for turns6 to turn16 (11 actions) should get us to (0,9) at turn17.\n\n          In our plan, at turn16 we are at y=7, and then we take an action at turn16: which is the 11th action? \n                action10: turn16: from y=7 we do U -> then at turn17: y=8.\n\n          So we are not at 9.\n\n          We need to be at y=9 at turn17.\n\n          To achieve that, we must have been at y=8 or 9 or 10 at turn16, and then at turn16 we do an action that leaves us at 9 at turn17: \n                if at turn16: y=8, then U -> 9.\n                if y=9, then any action leaves us at 9 (clamping) or S -> 9.\n                if y=10: but then we are at state that we shouldn't be.\n\n          So easiest: at turn16: we are at y=8, then do U.\n\n          How to be at y=8 at turn16? \n                turn16: freeway8: \n                  car1: [1,12] -> safe.\n                so allowed.\n\n          How to get to y=8 at turn16 (which is the state at the beginning of turn16)?\n\n          We need to have taken 10 actions to get to that state.\n\n          The plan for the first 10 actions (turns6 to turn15) should get us to y=8 at turn16.\n\n          How? \n                net +8.\n\n          But we might have to avoid the dangerous turns.\n\n          Specifically, we must not be at freeway7 or 8 at turns7,14,15 and freeway1 at 22-25 (not reached).\n\n          We also must not be at freeway7 or 8 at turn14 and turn15.\n\n          Let me plan for 10 actions to get to y=8 at turn16:\n\n            state at turn6:0\n            turn6: action0: U -> state7:1\n            turn7: action1: U -> state8:2\n            turn8: action2: U -> state9:3\n            turn9: action3: U -> state10:4\n            turn10: action4: U -> state11:5\n            turn11: action5: U -> state12:6\n            turn12: action6: U -> state13:7  [at turn13: freeway7: safe]\n            turn13: action7: we cannot stay at 7 (because then state14:7, dangerous) \n                     we cannot go to 8 (state14:8, dangerous)\n                     so we go down to 6: state14:6.\n            turn14: action8: we cannot go to 7 (state15:7, dangerous at turn15) \n                     so we can only go to 5,6 or stay at 6.\n                     say, stay: state15:6.\n            turn15: action9: from 6, we can go to 7? \n                     then state16:7. -> but we want state16:8.\n                     or to 5: state16:5.\n                     or to 6: state16:6.\n            None gets to 8.\n\n          Alternatively, at turn14: from 6, can we go to 7? \n                     state15:7 -> dangerous (freeway7 at turn15: dangerous) -> not allowed.\n\n          So we are stuck.\n\n          Therefore, we must be at y=8 at turn16 by taking a different route.\n\n          What if we are at y=7 at turn15? \n                state15:7 -> dangerous.\n          or y=8 at turn15? \n                state15:8 -> dangerous.\n\n          So we cannot be at y>=7 at turn15.\n\n          Therefore, we cannot reach y=8 at turn16.\n\n        Given the complexity, let's fall back to our working plan that gets to y=9 at turn18, and then we set H=13: \n                turn6+H-1 = 6+13-1 = 18.\n                So we want to be at (0,9) at turn18.\n\n                Actions: 13 actions: turns6 to 18.\n\n                In our plan, we have 12 actions that get us to y=8 at turn18? \n                        state18:8.\n\n                Then we need one more action at turn18: U, to get to y=9 at turn19.\n\n                But we want to be at y=9 at turn18.\n\n        Alternatively, we can modify the plan to be at y=9 at turn18 by:\n\n          actions0 to action11: as before, gets us to state18:8.\n          then action12: not taken yet.\n\n        But we want state18:9.\n\n        So if at turn18: we are at state18:8, and then we do U, we become state19:9.\n\n        But we want state18:9.\n\n        state18:9 means that at the beginning of turn18, we are at 9.\n\n        So we must have gotten to 9 by the action at turn17.\n\n        Therefore, the first 12 actions (turns6 to 17) should get us to state18:9.\n\n        How many state changes? \n                actions0 to action11: 12 actions, advance the state from state6 to state18.\n\n                state6:0\n                state18:9\n\n                net change: +9, which is exactly 12 actions can achieve if we have 9 U's and 3 non-U's (like S or D).\n\n        In our earlier plan with 12 actions (which were: 7U, 1D, 2S, 2U), we have: \n                U: 7+2 = 9\n                D: 1\n                S: 2\n                -> 9U, 1D, 2S: net +8.\n\n        We are at state18:0+9-1=8.\n\n        To net +9, we need one more U or one less D.\n\n        How about at the last step, we do an extra U and remove a S or D?\n\n        We can try to remove the D at turn13: instead go up at turn13.\n\n        But then at turn14: we would be at y=8, dangerous.\n\n        Or remove a S: but we have to wait.\n\n        Alternatively, we can do an extra U somewhere safe.\n\n        For example, after turn12: we are at y=7.\n          turn13: if we do U: to y=8 at turn14: dangerous.\n\n        before turn12: we are at turn12: state12:6.\n          turn12: we can do U: state13:7.\n          turn13: we have to leave: D to state14:6.\n          turn14: S: state15:6.\n          turn15: S: state16:6.\n          turn16: U: state17:7.\n          turn17: U: state18:8.\n          then we need one more U: but that would be action12 at turn18: to state19:9.\n\n        So we are at state18:8, not 9.\n\n        How about we do an extra U earlier? \n\n        For example, at turn somewhere safe, do an extra U and remove a S.\n\n        We have two S's at turn14 and turn15.\n\n        Remove one S: \n          turn6:U7:1\n          turn7:U8:2\n          turn8:U9:3\n          turn9:U10:4\n          turn10:U11:5\n          turn11:U12:6\n          turn12:U13:7\n          turn13:D14:6\n          turn14: we do U (instead of S) -> state15:7 -> dangerous at turn15.\n\n        not allowed.\n\n        Remove the D? then we would have net 10 U's and 2 S's: net +10, which would go to 10, clamped to 9.\n\n        But let's see:\n\n          turn6:U->1\n          turn7:U->2\n          turn8:U->3\n          turn9:U->4\n          turn10:U->5\n          turn11:U->6\n          turn12:U->7\n          turn13: we do not do D, but we have to avoid being at 7 at turn14? -> so we must move.\n                if we do U: to 8 at turn14: dangerous.\n                if we do S: to 7 at turn14: dangerous.\n                if we do D: to 6 at turn14: safe.\n          then turn14: we can try to do U to 7 at turn15: dangerous.\n\n        so it doesn't work.\n\n        Therefore, we need to have 9 net up moves.\n\n        Our plan has 9U - 1D = net 8.\n\n        To net 9, we need either 10U - 1D = net 9, or 9U = net9.\n\n        How to net 9U without any D? \n                then we would be at state 9 at turn 6+9 = 15.\n\n                but at turn15: we are at y=9, which is safe.\n\n                actions: turns6 to 14: 9 actions of U.\n\n                then we are at state15:9.\n\n                and we want to be at state18:9 for turn18? -> but we are at state15:9.\n\n                then for turns15,16,17: we can do anything, say SSS.\n\n                so the plan: 9 U's and then 3 S's.\n\n                check safety:\n\n                  state at turn7:1 -> freeway1: safe.\n                  turn8:2 -> safe.\n                  turn9:3 -> safe.\n                  turn10:4 -> safe.\n                  turn11:5 -> safe.\n                  turn12:6 -> safe.\n                  turn13:7 -> safe.\n                  turn14:8 -> freeway8: dangerous at turn14: car1: [ -59+6*8, -48+48] = [-11,0] -> covers 0 -> dangerous.\n\n                so at turn14: we are at state14:8, and freeway8 is dangerous -> collide.\n\n        So we must avoid that.\n\n        The only way to net 9 without being in danger is to avoid being at y=8 at turn14 and y=7 at turn15 and y=8 at turn15.\n\n        We can try to insert a wait before the last up move.\n\n        For example, at some safe spot, do a S instead of U, and then do an extra U later.\n\n        But then we net the same.\n\n        Given the complexity, let's output the plan we have for 12 actions that gets us to y=8 at turn18, and then we do an extra U at turn18 to get to y=9 at turn19, but that would be for H=13.\n\n        But we want to be at y=9 at turn18 ( for H=13: turn6+13-1=18) \n\n        So we need to be at y=9 at the beginning of turn18.\n\n        Therefore, we must have gotten to y=9 by the action at turn17.\n\n        So the first 12 actions ( turns6 to 17) should get us to state18:9.\n\n        net +9 in 12 actions: means we must have 9 up's and 3 non-up's that net 0.\n\n        non-up's: S or D -> net 0 if we have only S's, or D's that are compensated.\n\n        In our earlier plan with 7U, 1D, 2S, then 2U: total 9U, 1D, 2S -> net 8.\n\n        to net 9, we need to remove one non-up move.\n\n        So remove one S: then net 9.\n\n        Plan:\n\n          turn6: U  // state7:1\n          turn7: U  // state8:2\n          turn8: U  // state9:3\n          turn9: U  // state10:4\n          turn10: U // state11:5\n          turn11: U // state12:6\n          turn12: U // state13:7\n          turn13: D // state14:6\n          turn14: S // state15:6\n          // removed one S: so turn15: we do U // state16:7\n          turn16: U // state17:8\n          turn17: U // state18:9\n\n        Then we have 12 actions, and at the beginning of turn18, we are at state18:9.\n\n        Now check safety for the new plan:\n\n          state7:1 -> safe.\n          state8:2 -> safe.\n          state9:3 -> safe.\n          state10:4 -> safe.\n          state11:5 -> safe.\n          state12:6 -> safe.\n          state13:7 -> safe.\n          state14:6 -> safe.\n          state15:6 -> safe.\n          state16:7 -> freeway7 at turn16: [ -59+6*(16-6), -48+60 ] = [1,12] -> safe.\n          state17:8 -> freeway8 at turn17: [ -59+6*(17-6), -48+66 ] = [7,18] -> safe.\n          state18:9 -> goal.\n\n        So it works.\n\n        Therefore, the actions for turns6 to turn17 (12 actions) are:\n\n          turn6: U\n          turn7: U\n          turn8: U\n          turn9: U\n          turn10: U\n          turn11: U\n          turn12: U\n          turn13: D\n          turn14: S\n          turn15: U  // instead of S\n          turn16: U\n          turn17: U\n\n        And this gets us to (0,9) at the beginning of turn18.\n\n        So H=12.\n\n        The sequence:\n\n          Turn 6: U\n          Turn 7: U\n          Turn 8: U\n          Turn 9: U\n          Turn 10: U\n          Turn 11: U\n          Turn 12: U\n          Turn 13: D\n          Turn 14: S\n          Turn 15: U\n          Turn 16: U\n          Turn 17: U\n\n        We output for turns 6 to 17.\n\n        Note: at turn15 we do U from y=6 to y=7, and it is safe because at turn16 freeway7 is safe.\n\n        This meets the condition.\n\n        So the answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 6\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\) is 12. The sequence of actions from turn 6 to turn 17 ensures the player reaches \\((0, 9)\\) at turn 18 (which is \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 6 + 12 - 1 = 17\\) is the last action turn, and the state at turn 18 is \\((0, 9)\\)).\n\nThe actions are determined to avoid dangerous freeway-time combinations:\n- Freeway 1 is dangerous at turns 22, 23, 24, 25.\n- Freeway 7 is dangerous at turns 7, 14, 15.\n- Freeway 8 is dangerous at turns 7, 14, 15.\n\nThe path avoids these by:\n- Moving up quickly to freeway 6 by turn 12.\n- Moving down to freeway 6 at turn 13 to avoid being on freeway 7 or 8 at turn 14.\n- Staying at freeway 6 at turn 14 to avoid danger.\n- Moving up to freeway 7 at turn 15, which is safe at turn 16.\n- Moving up to freeway 8 at turn 16, safe at turn 17.\n- Moving up to freeway 9 at turn 17, reaching the goal at turn 18.\n\nThe sequence of actions is:\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn } 6: \\ U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 7: \\ U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 8: \\ U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 9: \\ U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 10: \\ U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 11: \\ U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 12: \\ U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 13: \\ D \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 14: \\ S \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 15: \\ U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 16: \\ U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 17: \\ U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at position (0, 2) on turn t_1, which is given as t_0 = 8. I think t_1 is 8, since it says \"current turn is {t_1}\" and then \"Current Turn: t_0 = 8\", so t_1 = 8. Player is at (0, 2), meaning y=2 initially.\n\nThe goal is to reach (0, 9) in minimal turns H, by moving up (U), down (D), or stay (S), with y changing by +1, -1, or 0 respectively, and y must stay between 0 and 9 inclusive.\n\nThere are cars on freeways y=1 to y=8, and I need to avoid collisions. Collision happens only if at turn T, the player is on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there is a car where 0 is in its span at that turn T.\n\nThe car spans move over time. For left-moving cars, span is [h, τ] and it moves left with speed s, so at time T, it's [h - s(T - t_1), τ - s(T - t_1)]. For right-moving, it's [τ, h] and moves right, so [τ + s(T - t_1), h + s(T - t_1)].\n\nIn the car state, for each freeway, there are cars listed with (head, tail, direction, speed). I need to parse this.\n\nFirst, let's list all cars per freeway:\n\n- Freeway 1: one car: (-42, -53, right, 3)\n\nDirection is right, so it's moving right. Head and tail: for right-moving, span is [tail, head], I think. From the update: for right-moving, \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h]\" and then at T, [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT]. So here, τ is tail, h is head.\n\nIn the table, it says \"Cars (head h, tail τ, ...)\", so for this car on freeway 1: head h = -42, tail τ = -53, direction right, speed 3.\n\nSince direction is right, span at t_1 is [τ, h] = [-53, -42], because tail to head, with head being larger since moving right.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, it would be [h, τ] with h larger, moving left.\n\nBut in this case, all cars seem to be right-moving except I need to check.\n\nLet's list all:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: head=-42, tail=-53, dir=right, speed=3 → span at t_1: [τ, h] = [-53, -42]\n\nFreeway 2: one car: head=-48, tail=-59, dir=right, speed=12 → span: [-59, -48]\n\nFreeway 3: same as 2? Head=-48, tail=-59, right, 12 → [-59, -48]\n\nFreeway 4: same, head=-48, tail=-59, right, 12 → [-59, -48]\n\nFreeway 5: same, head=-48, tail=-59, right, 12 → [-59, -48]\n\nFreeway 6: two cars: first (-48, -59, right, 12) → [-59, -48], and second (24, 13, right, 12)? Head=24, tail=13, dir=right, speed=12.\n\nTail=13, head=24, since moving right, span should be [tail, head] = [13, 24]? But at t_1.\n\nt_1 is current turn, 8.\n\nFor the second car: tail=13, head=24, so span at t_1: [τ, h] = [13, 24]\n\nSimilarly, first car on freeway 6: [-59, -48]\n\nFreeway 7: two cars: first (-36, -47, right, 6) → tail=-47, head=-36, so span [-47, -36]\n\nSecond: (12, 1, right, 6) → tail=1, head=12, span [1,12]\n\nFreeway 8: same as 7? First (-36, -47, right, 6) → [-47, -36], second (12, 1, right, 6) → [1,12]\n\nNow, the player needs to move from y=2 to y=9, so that's moving up 7 positions. But since we can move down or stay, and there are cars, we might need to wait or move down to avoid collisions, but moving down might not help since we need to go up to 9, and y=0 is bottom, but we can go to y=0 if needed, but probably not necessary.\n\ny from 0 to 9, player can be at y=0 or y=9.\n\nBut goal is (0,9), so y=9.\n\nNow, collision happens only if at turn T, player is on freeway k=y_T, and for that freeway, there is a car where 0 is in its span at that exact turn T.\n\nAlso, important: when you move, at turn T, you are on y_T, and you choose action to go to y_{T+1}, but at turn T, you are on y_T, so you check collision for freeway y_T at turn T.\n\nAnd when you move to y_{T+1}, you are not on y_{T+1} at turn T, only at turn T+1.\n\nSo, for example, if at turn T you are on y, and you move to y+1, then at turn T, you are on y, so check cars on freeway y at turn T. Then at turn T+1, you are on y+1, check cars on freeway y+1 at turn T+1.\n\nNow, the cars are moving, so I need to find when 0 is in the span for each car on each freeway at different times.\n\nSince the player moves one step at a time, and we need min H, probably the minimal time is at least the vertical distance, which is 7, since from y=2 to y=9, difference 7, so min H=7 if we can go straight up without colliding.\n\nBut we need to check if that's possible with the cars.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway and each turn after t_1, when 0 is occupied by a car.\n\nt_1 = 8, so let Δt = T - t_1, so at time T, Δt = T - 8.\n\nFor a car, span at T is:\n\nIf right-moving: [τ + s * Δt, h + s * Δt]\n\nIf left-moving, [h - s * Δt, τ - s * Δt]\n\nBut in this case, all cars are right-moving, I think? From the table, all directions are \"right\", so no left-moving cars. Let me confirm.\n\nFreeway 1: right\n\n2: right\n\n3: right\n\n4: right\n\n5: right\n\n6: both right\n\n7: both right\n\n8: both right\n\nYes, all cars are right-moving.\n\nSo for any car, span at time T (turn T) is [τ + s * (T - 8), h + s * (T - 8)]\n\nSince direction right.\n\nNow, collision on freeway k at turn T if there is a car on k such that 0 is in [τ + s*(T-8), h + s*(T-8)]\n\nWhich means τ + s*(T-8) ≤ 0 ≤ h + s*(T-8)\n\nSince for right-moving, τ ≤ h, so the span is from lower to higher.\n\nτ is tail, h is head, so τ ≤ h, so [low, high] with low = τ + s*Δt, high = h + s*Δt.\n\nSo 0 is in [low, high] iff low ≤ 0 ≤ high.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but none here.\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need to find for which turns T, the freeway has a car with 0 in span.\n\nBut since multiple cars per freeway, I need to see for each T, if any car on that freeway has 0 in span at T.\n\nPlayer is on freeway k at turn T, so if k has collision at T, player can't be on k at T.\n\nNow, let's list for each freeway the cars and when 0 is covered.\n\nStart with freeway 1: only one car: τ = -53, h = -42, s = 3\n\nSo low at T: -53 + 3*(T-8)\n\nHigh: -42 + 3*(T-8)\n\n0 in span if -53 + 3*(T-8) ≤ 0 ≤ -42 + 3*(T-8)\n\nFirst inequality: -53 + 3*(T-8) ≤ 0 → 3*(T-8) ≤ 53 → T-8 ≤ 53/3 ≈ 17.666, so T-8 ≤ 17 since T integer\n\nSecond inequality: 0 ≤ -42 + 3*(T-8) → 42 ≤ 3*(T-8) → 14 ≤ T-8 → T ≥ 22\n\nNow, T-8 ≤ 17 and T ≥ 22? 17 < 22, impossible. So no solution? Let me calculate.\n\n-53 + 3Δt ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ -42 + 3Δt\n\nSo 3Δt ≤ 53 and 3Δt ≥ 42\n\nSo Δt ≤ floor(53/3) = 17 since 53/3=17.666, so Δt ≤ 17\n\nAnd Δt ≥ ceil(42/3) = 14 since 42/3=14 exactly, so Δt ≥ 14\n\nSo for Δt from 14 to 17 inclusive.\n\nΔt = T-8, so for T from 22 to 25? Let's see:\n\nΔt=14: T=8+14=22\n\nlow = -53 + 3*14 = -53 + 42 = -11 ≤ 0? -11 ≤ 0 true\n\nhigh = -42 + 42 = 0 ≤ 0? 0 ≤ 0 true, so 0 is included since closed interval, I assume.\n\nSimilarly, Δt=15: low = -53+45= -8 ≤0, high=-42+45=3 ≥0, 0 in.\n\nΔt=16: low=-53+48= -5≤0, high=-42+48=6≥0\n\nΔt=17: low=-53+51= -2≤0, high=-42+51=9≥0\n\nΔt=18: low=-53+54=1>0? 1≤0 false, so low=1 >0, not ≤0, so 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, Δt=13: low=-53+39= -14≤0, high=-42+39= -3 <0? 0 ≤ -3 false, so not.\n\nSo for freeway 1, collision at T=22,23,24,25 (since T=22 to 25, Δt=14 to17)\n\nT=22: Δt=14, yes; T=23: Δt=15; T=24: Δt=16; T=25: Δt=17.\n\nNow freeway 2: car: τ=-59, h=-48, s=12\n\nlow = -59 + 12*(T-8)\n\nhigh = -48 + 12*(T-8)\n\n0 in [low, high] iff -59 +12Δt ≤ 0 ≤ -48 +12Δt\n\nFirst: -59 +12Δt ≤0 → 12Δt ≤59 → Δt ≤ floor(59/12)=4 since 12*4=48<59, 12*5=60>59? 59/12=4.916, so Δt ≤4? 12Δt ≤59, Δt ≤ 59/12 ≈4.916, so since Δt integer, Δt ≤4\n\nBut let's keep inequality.\n\n-59 +12Δt ≤0 → 12Δt ≤59 → Δt ≤ floor(59/12)=4? 12*4=48≤59, 48<59, so -59+48=-11≤0 true, but need both inequalities.\n\nSecond inequality: 0 ≤ -48 +12Δt → 48 ≤12Δt → Δt ≥ 48/12=4\n\nSo Δt ≥4 and Δt ≤ floor(59/12)=4? 12Δt ≤59, Δt ≤ 59/12=4.916, so Δt ≤4 since integer? Δt=4: 12*4=48≤59, true; Δt=5: 12*5=60>59, so -59+60=1>0, not ≤0.\n\nFirst inequality: -59 +12Δt ≤0\n\nFor Δt=4: -59+48= -11 ≤0 true\n\nFor Δt=5: -59+60=1 >0, false\n\nSecond inequality: 0 ≤ -48 +12Δt → for Δt=4: -48+48=0≤0 true\n\nFor Δt=3: -48+36= -12 <0, 0≤ -12 false\n\nSo only when Δt=4: both true.\n\nThus for freeway 2, collision only at T=8+4=12\n\nT=12.\n\nBut t_1=8, so T=12.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same car as freeway 2? Head=-48, tail=-59, right,12, same as freeway 2.\n\nFreeway 3: car (-48,-59,right,12), same as freeway 2, so collision only at T=12.\n\nSimilarly freeway 4: same, collision at T=12.\n\nFreeway 5: same, collision at T=12.\n\nNow freeway 6: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (-48,-59,right,12), same as above, so at T=12, it has collision, but we need for each freeway separately.\n\nFor freeway 6, first car: same as freeway 2, so at T=12, low=-59+12*4= -59+48=-11, high=-48+48=0, so 0 in [-11,0], yes.\n\nBut also second car: (24,13,right,12)? Head=24, tail=13, dir=right, speed=12.\n\nSpan at t_1: [τ, h] = [13,24]\n\nAt time T, [τ + sΔt, h + sΔt] = [13 +12Δt, 24 +12Δt]\n\n0 in span if 13+12Δt ≤ 0 ≤ 24+12Δt\n\nBut 13+12Δt ≥13 >0 for all Δt≥0, since Δt≥0, so 13+12Δt >0, so low >0, thus 0 < low ≤ high, so 0 not in [low,high] since low>0.\n\nThus for second car, 0 is never in span because the car is at positive positions moving right, so from 13 up, never at 0.\n\nSo for freeway 6, only the first car matters, and collision at T=12 only.\n\nNow freeway 7: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (-36,-47,right,6) → τ=-47, h=-36, s=6\n\nlow = -47 + 6*(T-8)\n\nhigh = -36 + 6*(T-8)\n\n0 in [low,high] iff -47 +6Δt ≤0 ≤ -36 +6Δt\n\nFirst: -47+6Δt ≤0 → 6Δt ≤47 → Δt ≤ floor(47/6)=7 since 6*7=42<47, 6*8=48>47? 47/6≈7.833, so Δt ≤7\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -36 +6Δt → 36 ≤6Δt → Δt ≥6\n\nSo Δt ≥6 and Δt ≤7\n\nΔt=6: low=-47+36= -11≤0, high=-36+36=0≤0 true\n\nΔt=7: low=-47+42= -5≤0, high=-36+42=6≥0 true\n\nΔt=8: low=-47+48=1>0? not ≤0\n\nΔt=5: low=-47+30= -17≤0, high=-36+30= -6<0, 0≤ -6 false\n\nSo collision at T=8+6=14 and T=8+7=15\n\nNow second car on freeway 7: (12,1,right,6) → τ=1, h=12, s=6\n\nlow = τ + sΔt = 1 + 6Δt\n\nhigh = h + sΔt = 12 + 6Δt\n\n0 in [low,high] iff 1+6Δt ≤ 0 ≤ 12+6Δt\n\nBut 1+6Δt ≥1 >0 for Δt≥0, so low >0, thus 0 not in [low,high] for any t. So no collision from this car.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 8.\n\nFreeway 8: first car same as freeway 7 first car: (-36,-47,right,6) → collision at T=14,15\n\nSecond car: (12,1,right,6) → same as above, no collision.\n\nSo summary of collision times per freeway:\n\n- Freeway 1: collision at T=22,23,24,25\n\n- Freeway 2: collision at T=12\n\n- Freeway 3: collision at T=12\n\n- Freeway 4: collision at T=12\n\n- Freeway 5: collision at T=12\n\n- Freeway 6: collision at T=12 (from first car)\n\n- Freeway 7: collision at T=14,15 (from first car)\n\n- Freeway 8: collision at T=14,15 (from first car)\n\nNow, player starts at y=2 at turn t=8.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nPlayer must not be on a freeway when it has collision at that turn.\n\nFor example, at turn 12, freeways 2,3,4,5,6 have collision, so if player is on y=2,3,4,5,6 at turn 12, collision.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 14 and 15, freeways 7 and 8 have collision, so if on y=7 or 8 at turn 14 or 15, collision.\n\nAlso, at turn 22-25, freeway 1 has collision, but since we start from y=2 and go to y=9, and min time is 7 turns, we probably won't be at turn 22, which is far in future, since from t=8, to t=22 is 14 turns later, but to reach y=9 from y=2 in min 7 turns, so by t=15 or so, we should be done, so freeway 1 collision at t=22-25 is not relevant, as player won't be there at that time.\n\nSimilarly, other collisions are at t=12,14,15.\n\nt=12 is only 4 turns after t=8, and we are at y=2, we might be affected.\n\nNow, player position: at turn T, y_T.\n\nWe start at T=8, y=2.\n\nWe choose actions for T=8,9,10,... up to when we reach y=9.\n\nH is the number of turns including the start or not? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence is from t= t_1 to t_1 + H-1, and at turn t_1 + H -1, y=9.\n\nSo at turn t_1 + H -1, position is (0,9).\n\nFor example, if H=1, but at t_1, y=2, not 9, so H at least 7.\n\nAt turn T, we perform action a_T, then y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy.\n\nAfter H turns, from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, we have H actions, and at turn t_1 + H -1, y is set to 9.\n\nLet's clarify the turns.\n\nAt turn t_1 (T=8), player is at y_{t_1} =2.\n\nThen we choose action a_{t_1}, which determines y_{t_1 +1} = y_9.\n\nSimilarly, at turn t_1 +1 =9, choose a_9, determines y_10, and so on, until at some turn T, y_T =9.\n\nThe turn when we reach y=9 is turn T, and H is such that T = t_1 + H -1, so H = T - t_1 +1.\n\nFor example, if we reach at turn 8, H=1, but y=2≠9.\n\nIf we reach at turn 9, H=2, meaning actions from t_1 to t_1+1-1=t_1, only one action at t_1.\n\nBut we need multiple actions.\n\nMinimal H: since from y=2 to y=9, we need at least 7 up moves, so minimal T to reach is turn 8+7=15 if we go up every turn, but we might need to stay or move down to avoid, so H min 7, but T min 15.\n\nT: at turn 8, y=2.\n\nAfter first action at T=8, y_9 = y8 + Δy, so at turn 9, y= y8 + Δy.\n\nSimilarly, at turn T, y_T.\n\nTo have y_T =9 for some T.\n\nThe earliest T is 15, if we go up each turn from T=8 to T=14, 7 actions: a8 to a14, then at turn 14, y=2+7=9? Let's see:\n\nTurn 8: y8=2, action a8, then y9 = y8 + Δy\n\nIf a8=U, y9=3\n\nTurn 9: y9=3, a9=U, y10=4\n\n...\n\nIf all U from turn 8 to 14: a8 to a14, that's 7 actions: turn 8,9,10,11,12,13,14.\n\nAfter a14, y15 is set, and at turn 15, y= y14 + Δy.\n\nIf a14=U, and y14=8 (since from turn8 y=2, after 6 ups to turn14, y14=2+6=8), then a14=U, y15=9.\n\nSo at turn 15, y=9.\n\nH: sequence from t_1 to t_1 + H-1, here t_1=8, actions a8 to a14, that's t_1 +0 to t_1 +6, so H=7 turns.\n\nT=15 = t_1 +7, but H=7, t_1 + H -1 =8+7-1=14, which is the turn we take the last action, but y is set for the next turn.\n\nAt turn t_1 + H -1, we take action, and after that, y_{t_1 + H} is set, but the position at turn t_1 + H -1 is before the action.\n\nThe question: \"reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1\"\n\n\"at turn t_1 + H -1, y_{t_1 + H -1} =9\"\n\nAnd actions from t= t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nSo at turn t_1 + H -1, y is 9, and we have performed H actions: from t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nFor example, to reach at turn 15, which is t_1 +7, so t_1 + H -1 =15, t_1=8, so 8 + H -1=15, H=8? Let's solve:\n\nt_1 + H -1 = T, where y_T=9.\n\nT = t_1 + H -1, so H = T - t_1 +1\n\nIf T=15, H=15-8+1=8 actions from turn 8 to 15? Turn 8 to 15 inclusive is 8 turns.\n\nBut at turn 15, y=9, which was set by action at turn 14.\n\nStandard: at turn T, we are at position y_T, then we choose action a_T, which sets y_{T+1}.\n\nSo to have y_T =9 at turn T.\n\nFor T=15, y15=9.\n\ny15 is set by action at turn 14.\n\ny15 = y14 + Δy14.\n\nIf y14=8 and a14=U, then y15=9.\n\nAt turn 15, position is (0,9), so we have reached.\n\nThe actions are from turn t_1 to the turn before reaching, or including?\n\nThe sequence is {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, so at time t_1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nThen at turn t_1 + H -1, we have y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nSo for example, if we reach at turn T, then t_1 + H -1 = T, so H = T - t_1 +1\n\nActions at turns: t_1, t_1+1, ..., t_1 + H -1\n\nWhich is from t_1 to T, since T = t_1 + H -1.\n\nAnd at turn T, y_T=9.\n\nIn terms of when y is set: y_T is determined by previous actions.\n\nBut for collision, at each turn, we care about y at that turn.\n\nBack to min H.\n\nMinimal T to reach y=9 from y=2 is T=15 with 7 up moves, but we may have to stay or move down to avoid collisions, so T could be larger, H larger.\n\nBut we want min H, so min time, so we should try to reach as soon as possible.\n\nNow, collisions at certain turns.\n\nPlayer must avoid being on a freeway when it has collision at that turn.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- At turn 12, freeways 2,3,4,5,6 have collision, so player cannot be on y=2,3,4,5,6 at turn 12.\n\n- At turn 14, freeways 7 and 8 have collision, so cannot be on y=7 or 8 at turn 14.\n\n- At turn 15, freeways 7 and 8 have collision, so cannot be on y=7 or 8 at turn 15.\n\n- Also, freeway 1 collision at 22-25, but too late, irrelevant.\n\nNow, at turn 8, y=2, which is freeway 2, but turn 8 is current, and we are given position, so I assume no collision at turn 8, since we start there.\n\nThe car state is given at t_1=8, so at turn 8, for freeway 2, let's check if 0 is in span.\n\nFreeway 2 car: at t_1, span [-59,-48], 0 not in, so no collision at turn 8.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, we need to plan actions from turn 8 onwards.\n\nLet me denote the turns: T=8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,...\n\nAt T=8, y=2.\n\nWe need y to be 9 at some T.\n\nMin T is 15.\n\nBut at T=12, if we are on y=2,3,4,5,6, collision, so we must not be on these at T=12.\n\nSimilarly, at T=14 and 15, cannot be on y=7 or 8.\n\ny=7 and 8 are freeways 7 and 8.\n\nNow, to reach y=9, we need to be at y=8 or 9 and move up, or at y=9 directly.\n\nBut since we start from below, we will reach y=8 at some point.\n\nPossible to reach y=9 by T=15.\n\nBut at T=14 and 15, if we are on y=7 or 8, collision, but at T=15, if we are on y=9, that is fine, since y=9 is not a freeway, freeways are y=1 to 8, y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, so no cars, no collision.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nOnly y=1 to 8 have cars.\n\nSo at turn T, if y_T=0 or 9, no collision possible.\n\nIf y_T between 1 and 8, then we need to check if freeway y_T has collision at T.\n\nFor T=15, if we can be at y=9, then no issue.\n\nSimilarly for other turns.\n\nTo reach y=9 by T=15, we need to be at y=8 at T=14, then move up to y=9 at T=15.\n\nBut at T=14, if we are at y=8, but freeway 8 has collision at T=14, so if we are on y=8 at T=14, collision.\n\nSimilarly, if we are on y=7 at T=14, collision on freeway 7.\n\nAt T=15, if we are on y=8, collision on freeway 8, but if on y=9, no problem.\n\nSo to reach at T=15 with y=9, we need at T=14 to be at y=8 and move up.\n\nBut at T=14, being on y=8 causes collision.\n\nSimilarly, being on y=7 at T=14 causes collision.\n\nSo we cannot be on y=7 or 8 at T=14.\n\nTherefore, we cannot reach y=9 at T=15 with the direct path, because at T=14 we need to be on y=8, but collision at T=14 on y=8.\n\nWe could be on y=9 at T=14, but to be on y=9 at T=14, we need to have moved faster, but from y=2 at T=8, to y=9 at T=14, that requires 7 moves in 6 turns? From T=8 to T=14 is 6 turns: actions at T=8 to T=13, 6 actions, to go from y=2 to y=9, need 7 steps, impossible in 6 actions, since each action changes y by at most 1.\n\nAfter k actions, y can increase by at most k, so to y=9 from y=2, need at least 7 actions, so earliest at T=15.\n\nThus, we cannot be at y=9 before T=15.\n\nSimilarly, at T=15, we can be at y=9 only if at T=14 we are at y=8 and move up.\n\nBut at T=14, we cannot be on y=8 because of collision on freeway 8.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to reach y=9 at T=15.\n\nWe must reach later, with H>7.\n\nNow, we need to avoid the collision times.\n\nSpecifically, at T=12, we cannot be on y=2,3,4,5,6.\n\nAt T=14 and T=15, we cannot be on y=7 or 8.\n\nAlso, T=15 has collision on y=7 and 8, but if we are on y=9, it's fine.\n\nBut to be on y=9, we need to have moved up from y=8 at some turn.\n\nNow, since we cannot be on y=8 at T=14 or T=15, we need to be on y=8 at another time when no collision.\n\nSimilarly for other positions.\n\nNow, let's list the forbidden (y,T) pairs:\n\n- At T=12, y=2,3,4,5,6 forbidden\n\n- At T=14, y=7,8 forbidden\n\n- At T=15, y=7,8 forbidden\n\nFor other y and T, it should be ok, as long as no other collisions.\n\nFor example, freeway 1 collision at T=22-25, but we won't be there.\n\nNow, we start at T=8, y=2.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nOne way is to stay or move down at some points to avoid being at forbidden positions.\n\nFor example, at T=12, we need to not be on y=2-6.\n\nSince we are at y=2 at T=8, in 4 turns to T=12, we can move to various y.\n\nFrom T=8 to T=12, that's actions at T=8,9,10,11, which affect y at T=9,10,11,12.\n\ny at T=12 depends on actions from T=8 to T=11.\n\nSimilarly, y at T=14 and T=15.\n\nSince we need to reach y=9, and min time, we should try to go up as much as possible, except when we need to avoid.\n\nFirst, let's handle T=12.\n\nAt T=12, we must not be on y=2,3,4,5,6. So we must be on y=0,1,7,8, or 9.\n\nBut y=0 or 1 is low, and we need to go up, so possible, but might not be efficient.\n\ny=7 or 8 at T=12 might be possible.\n\nSimilarly, at T=14, must not be on y=7 or 8, so must be on y=0-6 or 9.\n\nBut y=9 is goal, good.\n\nNow, let's plan a path.\n\nStart at T=8, y=2.\n\nWe can choose actions.\n\nSuppose we go up as much as possible, but avoid forbidden.\n\nAt T=12, we need to be at y<=1 or y>=7.\n\ny=7 or 8 at T=12 is possible if we move up fast.\n\nFrom T=8 to T=12, 4 actions: we can increase y by up to 4, so y at T=12 can be from 2-4= -2? but y min 0, so y from 0 to 6.\n\ny at T=8: 2\n\nAfter action at T=8, y9 = 2 + Δy, so y9 can be 1,2,3\n\nSimilarly, after T=9 action, y10, and so on.\n\ny at T=12: after 4 actions (T=8 to T=11), y12 can be from max(0,2-4)=0 to min(9,2+4)=6.\n\nSo possible y at T=12: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6.\n\nBut forbidden: 2,3,4,5,6, so only allowed y=0 or 1 at T=12.\n\nSimilarly, if we move down, we can be at y=0 or 1.\n\nAt T=12, must be at y=0 or 1 to avoid collision.\n\nThen, from there, we need to go to y=9.\n\nAt T=14 and T=15, must not be on y=7 or 8.\n\nNow, let's find the earliest time to reach y=9.\n\nSince we must be at low y at T=12, we can be at y=0 or 1.\n\nSuppose we aim to be at y=1 at T=12.\n\nThen from T=8 to T=12, we need to go from y=2 to y=1, so net down one, or stay, but with actions.\n\nIn 4 actions, to decrease by 1, we can have various ways.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9 later.\n\nAfter T=12, we have T=13,14,15,...\n\nAt T=14, must not be on y=7 or 8, so y<=6 or y=9.\n\nSimilarly at T=15, y<=6 or y=9.\n\nBut to reach y=9, if we can be at y=9 at T=14, but impossible as before, min T=15.\n\nSo at T=15, if y=9, good, no problem.\n\nBut to be at y=9 at T=15, we need at T=14 to be at y=8 and move up, but at T=14, we cannot be on y=8 because collision.\n\nIf at T=14 we are at y=9, impossible.\n\nSo we must reach y=9 after T=15.\n\nEarliest possible at T=16.\n\nAt T=16, y=9.\n\nThen t_1 + H -1 =16, t_1=8, so 8 + H -1=16, H=9.\n\nActions from T=8 to T=15? T = t_1 + H -1 =16, so actions at t=8 to 15, 8 actions.\n\ny at T=16=9.\n\nTo have y16=9, we need at T=15 to be at y=8 or 9 and move accordingly.\n\nBut at T=15, if we are at y=8, and freeway 8 has collision at T=15, so we cannot be on y=8 at T=15.\n\nIf we are at y=9 at T=15, then we can stay or move, but y=9 is safe.\n\nBut to reach y=9 at T=16, we need to be at y=8 at T=15 and move up.\n\nBut at T=15, cannot be on y=8.\n\nContradiction.\n\nIf at T=15 we are at y=9, then we have reached at T=15, but we cannot reach at T=15 as earlier.\n\nAt T=15, if y=9, reached.\n\nBut to have y=9 at T=15, we need at T=14 to be at y=8 and move up, but at T=14, cannot be on y=8.\n\nIf at T=14 we are at y=9, impossible.\n\nSo indeed, cannot reach at T=15.\n\nNow for T=16: y16=9.\n\nThen we need at T=15 to be at y=8 or 9.\n\nIf at T=15, y=9, then reached at T=15, but we are considering T=16.\n\nIf y16=9, then at T=15, we were at some y, and we moved to y=9.\n\nSo possible: at T=15, y=8, a15=U, then y16=9.\n\nOr at T=15, y=9, a15=S or D or U, but y stays or changes, but if y=9, it is already reached.\n\nBut for reaching at T=16, we can have y15=8, a15=U, y16=9.\n\nOr y15=9, a15=S, y16=9, but that means reached at T=15.\n\nSimilarly, other cases.\n\nBut min time, we want to reach as soon as possible, so if possible at T=16.\n\nNow, at T=15, if we are at y=8, but freeway 8 has collision at T=15, so we cannot be on y=8 at T=15.\n\nSimilarly, if at T=15, y=9, no collision, but we cannot be at y=9 at T=15 as per above.\n\nSo for T=15, y cannot be 8, and cannot be 9, so y must be 0-7, but y=7 at T=15 has collision on freeway 7.\n\nFreeway 7 collision at T=15, so y=7 forbidden.\n\nSimilarly y=8 forbidden.\n\nSo at T=15, possible y: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,9.\n\nBut y=9 not possible to reach.\n\nSo y=0 to 6 at T=15.\n\nThen for T=16, we can be at y=8 or 9.\n\nIf at T=15, y=8, a15=U, y16=9.\n\nBut at T=15, y=8 not allowed.\n\nIf at T=15, y=9, not possible.\n\nSo only way to y16=9 is from y15=8 with U, but y15=8 forbidden.\n\nThus, we cannot reach at T=16 either, because to reach y=9 at T=16, we need to be at y=8 at T=15, which is forbidden.\n\nSimilarly, at T=17: y17=9.\n\nThen at T=16, we need to be at y=8 or 9.\n\nIf y16=8, a16=U, y17=9.\n\nOr y16=9, a16=U, y17=10>9 not allowed, y max 9, so if y16=9, a16=S or D, y17=9 or 8.\n\nBut to have y17=9, from y16=9 with S or from y16=8 with U.\n\nNow, at T=16, what is the collision situation?\n\nWe have car collisions only at specific times: T=12,14,15 for the relevant freeways.\n\nAt T=16, no collisions mentioned, so all freeways are safe at T=16.\n\nSimilarly, for other T not 12,14,15.\n\nSo at T=16, we can be on any y, no collision.\n\nSimilarly, T=13,11, etc.\n\nSo for T=17, y17=9, we can have:\n\n- At T=16, y=8, a16=U, y17=9\n\n- Or at T=16, y=9, a16=S, y17=9\n\nBut if y16=9, it is reached earlier.\n\nTo reach at T=17, we can start from y16=8.\n\nAt T=16, y=8 is possible since no collision at T=16.\n\nSimilarly, we can be at y=9 at T=16 if possible.\n\nBut let's first see if we can reach by T=17.\n\nT=17 is t_1 + 9? t_1=8, T=17, H such that t_1 + H -1 =17, 8+H-1=17, H=10.\n\nActions from T=8 to T=16, 9 actions? t=8 to 16 inclusive is 9 turns.\n\nt_1 + t for t=0 to H-1, so at t=0: T=8, t=1: T=9, ..., t=H-1: T= t_1 + H -1.\n\nSo for T= t_1 + H -1 =17, so 8 + H -1=17, H=10.\n\nActions at T=8 to T=17? No: actions at t_1 to t_1 + H -1, which is T=8 to 17, but T=17 is the turn we reach, so actions up to T=16, and at T=17, y=9.\n\nActions at T=8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16 for H=10 actions, and at turn T=17, y=9.\n\nNow, we also have the constraint at T=12 to be at y=0 or 1.\n\nAnd at T=14 and T=15, not on y=7 or 8.\n\nSince we reach at T=17, we have more time.\n\nFirst, let's plan the path to satisfy the constraints.\n\nStart: T=8, y=2.\n\nWe need at T=12, y=0 or 1.\n\nFrom T=8 to T=12, 4 actions: T=8,9,10,11 actions affect y at T=9,10,11,12.\n\ny at T=12 depends on actions at T=8 to T=11.\n\nTo have y12 <=1.\n\nSince y8=2, we need to decrease or stay low.\n\nFor example, we can go down to y=1 or 0.\n\nBut y=0 might be ok, but let's aim for y=1 at T=12.\n\nNow, after T=12, we need to go up to y=9.\n\nBut at T=14 and T=15, we cannot be on y=7 or 8.\n\nSo we need to avoid y=7 and 8 at T=14 and T=15.\n\nNow, from T=12, y=1 (say), we have actions to go up.\n\nT=12, y=1.\n\nThen action at T=12, y13 = y12 + Δy\n\nT=13, y14 = y13 + Δy\n\nT=14, y15 = y14 + Δy\n\nT=15, y16 = y15 + Δy\n\nT=16, y17 = y16 + Δy\n\nWe want y17=9.\n\nAlso, at T=14, y14 cannot be 7 or 8.\n\nAt T=15, y15 cannot be 7 or 8.\n\ny14 and y15 must be <=6 or =9.\n\nBut y=9 at T=14 or 15 is unlikely since we are low at T=12.\n\ny12=1, so at T=14, after 2 actions (T=12 and T=13), y14 can be from 1-2= -1, min 0, to 1+2=3, so y14 <=3, which is <=6, so automatically not 7 or 8, so no problem at T=14, since y14 <=3 <7.\n\nSimilarly, at T=15, y15: after action at T=14, y15 = y14 + Δy.\n\ny14 <=3, so y15 <=4 or 5 max, less than 7, so y15 <=5 <7, so not 7 or 8, so no issue at T=15.\n\nThen we can continue to go up.\n\nAt T=16, we can be at y=8 or something, then to y=9 at T=17.\n\nBut let's compute the y values.\n\nFirst, from T=8 to T=12, need y12=0 or 1.\n\nStart y8=2.\n\nTo have y12=1, for example.\n\nWe can have various sequences.\n\nFor instance, all stay: but y12=2, not <=1.\n\nNeed to decrease.\n\nFor example: at T=8, action D, then y9=2-1=1\n\nThen at T=9, action S, y10=1\n\nT=10, S, y11=1\n\nT=11, S, y12=1\n\nThen at T=12, y=1.\n\nNow, from here, we need to go up to y=9 in 5 actions to T=16 for y17=9? From T=12 to T=16.\n\ny at T=12:1\n\nAfter action at T=12, y13\n\nT=13, y14\n\nT=14, y15\n\nT=15, y16\n\nT=16, y17\n\nWe want y17=9.\n\nWith 5 actions, we can increase by up to 5, so y17 <=1+5=6 <9, not enough.\n\ny12=1, after 5 actions (T=12 to T=16), y17 can be from 1-5= -4, min 0, to 1+5=6.\n\nMax y17=6 <9, cannot reach y=9.\n\nProblem.\n\nIf y12=0, even worse.\n\ny12=0, max y17=5<9.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9, so with y12=1, we can only get to y=6 at T=17, not 9.\n\nT=17 y17=9, but from y12=1, after 5 actions, max increase 5, so y17<=6.\n\nTo reach y=9, we need higher y earlier.\n\nBut at T=12, we must be at low y, 0 or 1.\n\nThen from there, to y=9, we need at least 8 more actions? y from 1 to 9, need 8 steps, so min 8 actions after T=12.\n\nFor example, at T=12, y=1, then after 8 actions, at T=20, y=9.\n\nBut H would be large.\n\nBut we can be at higher y at T=12 if possible, but at T=12, we can only be at y=0 or 1, not higher, because higher y are forbidden.\n\ny=2 to 6 forbidden, so only 0 or 1.\n\nSo we are stuck at low y at T=12.\n\nThen from y=1 at T=12, to y=9, need 8 up moves, so min at T=12 + 8 = 20 for y=9? Turn T=20.\n\ny at T=12:1\n\nAfter action T=12, y13\n\n...\n\nTo have y20=9, for example.\n\nThen H: t_1 + H -1 =20, 8+H-1=20, H=13.\n\nBut we can reach earlier if we go up faster after T=12.\n\nBut from T=12, we have to take actions to increase y.\n\nEach U increases y by 1, so from y=1 to y=9, need exactly 8 U moves, in 8 actions, so min turn to reach is T=20 if we start from T=12 y=1 with all U.\n\nActions at T=12 to T=19, 8 actions, all U, then y20=1+8=9.\n\nAt turn T=20, y=9.\n\nH=13? t_1 + H -1=20, 8+H-1=20, H=13.\n\nBut is there a way to be higher at T=12? No, because we must be at y=0 or 1.\n\nAt T=8, y=2, we can move up before T=12 to higher y, but at T=12, we must be at y=0 or 1, so we have to move down or stay to be low at T=12.\n\nFor example, from T=8 to T=11, we can go to y=6, but at T=12, if y=6, collision, so we cannot be high at T=12; we have to be low.\n\nSo we are forced to be low at T=12, then from there, it takes at least 8 turns to reach y=9.\n\nBut we have the constraints at T=14 and 15, but since we are low, it was automatically satisfied.\n\nBut let's confirm if we can reach faster.\n\nAnother idea: at T=12, we are at y=1, but we can be at y=1 earlier, and start going up before T=12.\n\nFor example, at T=8, y=2, we can go down to y=1 at T=9, then stay or something, but at T=12 we need to be at y=1, so we can be at y=1 from T=9 to T=12, for example.\n\nBut from T=9 to T=12, if we are at y=1, we can go up, but at T=12, we are at y=1, so we can only start going up from T=12 action.\n\nSo the position at T=12 is fixed to 0 or 1, then we go up from there.\n\nSo min turns from T=12 to reach y=9 is 8, at T=20.\n\nBut T=20 is late, and we have freeway 1 collision at T=22-25, but y=1 at that time, not on freeway 1, so ok.\n\nBut can we avoid being low for so long?\n\nPerhaps we can be at y=0 or 1 at T=12, but then move up quickly, but still need 8 steps.\n\nUnless we can be at higher y at some point before, but at T=12 we are low.\n\nAnother thought: at T=14 and T=15, we have constraints, but since we are below y=7, it's fine.\n\nBut to reach faster, we need to be higher before T=12.\n\nBut we can't because at T=12 we must be low.\n\nFor example, from T=8 to T=11, we can go up to y=6, but at T=12, if y=6, collision, so we must not be at y=6 at T=12, so we have to move down at T=11 or something.\n\nBut let's list the y over time.\n\nDenote the action at each turn.\n\nSet T=8, y=2\n\nWe need y12 =0 or 1.\n\nSuppose we want to reach as soon as possible, so we go down immediately to be low early, then go up.\n\nFor example:\n\nT=8: action D, y9 = 2-1 =1\n\nT=9: action S, y10=1\n\nT=10: action S, y11=1\n\nT=11: action S, y12=1\n\nNow at T=12, y=1\n\nThen from here, we go up as fast as possible:\n\nT=12: action U, y13=1+1=2\n\nT=13: U, y14=3\n\nT=14: U, y15=4\n\nT=15: U, y16=5\n\nT=16: U, y17=6\n\nT=17: U, y18=7\n\nT=18: U, y19=8\n\nT=19: U, y20=9\n\nSo at T=20, y=9.\n\nH: t_1 + H -1 =20, 8+H-1=20, H=13.\n\nBut at T=14, y14=3, which is freeway 3, but at T=14, freeway 3 has no collision, only at T=12, so ok.\n\nSimilarly, y15=4, freeway 4, no collision at T=15, only at T=12.\n\nT=15 collision only for y=7 and 8.\n\ny=4 is fine.\n\nBut we reached at T=20.\n\nCan we reach earlier?\n\nSuppose at T=12, we are at y=0, but that might be worse.\n\nOr we can go down faster.\n\nFor example, T=8: D, y9=1\n\nT=9: D, y10=0\n\nT=10: S, y11=0\n\nT=11: S, y12=0\n\nThen T=12: U, y13=1\n\nT=13: U, y14=2\n\n... up to T=19: U, y20=8? y13=1, y14=2, y15=3, y16=4, y17=5, y18=6, y19=7, y20=8, then need another U at T=20 for y21=9, later.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo better to be at y=1 at T=12.\n\nBut still T=20.\n\nBut we have the collision at T=14 and 15 for y=7,8, but in this path, at T=14 y=3, T=15 y=4, not 7 or 8, so ok.\n\nBut can we start going up earlier?\n\nFor example, after being at low y, but at T=12 we must be low.\n\nSuppose we are at y=1 at T=9, then from T=9 to T=12, we can stay at y=1, but we can also go up, but at T=12 we need to be at y=0 or 1, so if we go up to y=2 at T=10, for example, then at T=12, if we are at y=2, collision, so we must move down before T=12.\n\nFor example:\n\nT=8: S, y9=2\n\nBut at T=9, y=2, freeway 2, no collision.\n\nT=9: S, y10=2\n\nT=10: U, y11=3\n\nBut at T=12, we need y12=0 or 1, so at T=11, y11=3, then action at T=11 must be D to go to y12=2, but y12=2 is forbidden, or D to y12=2? y11=3, a11=D, y12=2, but y12=2 forbidden at T=12.\n\na11=D, y12=2, collision.\n\na11=U, y12=4, worse.\n\na11=S, y12=3, forbidden.\n\nSo to have y12<=1, from y11, we need y11 <=1, because if y11=2, a11=D, y12=1; a11=S, y12=2 forbidden; a11=U, y12=3 forbidden. So only if y11=2 and a11=D, y12=1, which is allowed.\n\nSimilarly, if y11=1, a11 any, y12=0,1,2; but y12=2 forbidden, so a11 must be S or D to have y12=0 or 1.\n\nIf a11=U, y12=2 forbidden.\n\nSimilarly, if y11=0, a11 any, y12= -1 not allowed, min 0, so a11=U or S, y12=1 or 0; a11=D, y12= -1 invalid, so a11 cannot be D if y11=0.\n\ny min 0.\n\nSo to have y12=0 or 1, we need y11 <=1, and if y11=2, only possible with a11=D to y12=1.\n\nBut y11=2 at T=11, freeway 2, is there collision? T=11, not 12, so no collision, ok.\n\nSimilarly, y11=1 or 0.\n\nBut in general, we can have higher y before T=12, but at T=12 must be low.\n\nFor example, we can be at y=6 at T=11, then a11=D, y12=5, but y12=5 forbidden at T=12.\n\ny12=5 not allowed.\n\nOnly y12=0 or 1 allowed.\n\nSo from y11, to have y12=0 or 1, y11 must be 0,1, or 2 with a11=D to y12=1.\n\nIf y11=3, a11=D, y12=2 forbidden; a11=S, y12=3 forbidden; a11=U, y12=4 forbidden. No way to y12=0 or 1 from y11=3.\n\nSimilarly, if y11=4, impossible to reach y12<=1.\n\nSo y11 must be 0,1, or 2.\n\nAnd if y11=2, must a11=D to y12=1.\n\nIf y11=1, a11 can be S or D to y12=1 or 0, or U to y12=2 forbidden, so a11 must be S or D.\n\nIf y11=0, a11 must be S or U to y12=0 or 1.\n\nSo essentially, to have y12=0 or 1, we need y11 <=2, and specific actions.\n\nBut y11 <=2.\n\nSimilarly, we can go up to y=6 at T=10, for example, but then at T=11, we need to be at y<=2, so we have to move down.\n\nFor instance:\n\nT=8: U, y9=3\n\nT=9: U, y10=4\n\nT=10: U, y11=5? But y11=5, then to have y12<=1, impossible, as above.\n\ny11 must be <=2 to have a chance for y12<=1.\n\nSo at T=11, y11 <=2.\n\nSimilarly, at T=10, y10 can be up to 6, but to have y11<=2, we need to move down.\n\nFor example:\n\nT=8: U, y9=3\n\nT=9: U, y10=4\n\nT=10: D, y11=3  (but y11=3>2, not <=2)\n\ny11=3, then as above, cannot reach y12<=1.\n\nT=10 action: from y10=4, a10=D, y11=3; a10=S, y11=4; a10=U, y11=5; all >=3, so y11>=3, then cannot have y12<=1.\n\nSo to have y11<=2, we need y10 <=3, and a10=D or S to reduce.\n\nFor example, y10=3, a10=D, y11=2; or y10=2, a10=D or S, y11=1 or 2; etc.\n\nBut it's messy, and we are spending actions to go up and then down, which may not save time.\n\nFor instance, to be at high y at T=10, say y10=4, but then to have y11<=2, impossible, so we cannot be at y=4 at T=10 if we want y12<=1.\n\nMax we can be at T=10 is y10=3, then a10=D, y11=2, then a11=D, y12=1.\n\nOr y10=2, a10=D, y11=1, a11=S, y12=1, etc.\n\nBut compared to being low from the beginning, we don't gain vertical position; we are still at y=1 at T=12, same as before.\n\nFor example:\n\nT=8: U, y9=3\n\nT=9: U, y10=4? y10=4, then cannot have y11<=2.\n\nT=8: U, y9=3\n\nT=9: S, y10=3\n\nT=10: D, y11=2\n\nT=11: D, y12=1\n\nThen at T=12, y=1, same as first sequence.\n\nThen from here, we need to go to y=9, which takes 8 up moves, at T=20.\n\nIf we do less up, but we have to reach y=9.\n\nSo it seems we cannot reach before T=20.\n\nBut at T=20, we are at y=9.\n\nNow, in this sequence, we have to check for other collisions.\n\nFor example, at T=14, y=3 or something, freeway 3, no collision.\n\nAt T=15, y=4, freeway 4, no collision.\n\nOnly at specific turns.\n\nFreeway 1 collision at T=22-25, but T=20 is before, so ok.\n\nSo H=13 actions.\n\nBut let's list the actions.\n\nFrom above:\n\nActions:\n\nT=8: U  (y9=3)\n\nT=9: S  (y10=3)\n\nT=10: D (y11=2)\n\nT=11: D (y12=1)\n\nT=12: U (y13=2)\n\nT=13: U (y14=3)\n\nT=14: U (y15=4)\n\nT=15: U (y16=5)\n\nT=16: U (y17=6)\n\nT=17: U (y18=7)\n\nT=18: U (y19=8)\n\nT=19: U (y20=9)\n\nAt T=19, action U, y20=9.\n\nTurn t_1 + H -1 =20, so T=20 is the turn we reach, actions from T=8 to T=19, which is 12 actions? T=8 to 19 inclusive is 12 turns.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =20, t_1=8, so 8 + H -1 =20, H=13.\n\nActions at t=8 to t=8+12=20? No.\n\nt from 0 to H-1, action at t_1 + t.\n\nFor t=0: T=8\n\nt=1: T=9\n\n...\n\nt=H-1: T= t_1 + H -1 =20\n\nSo actions at T=8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20? 13 actions.\n\nBut at T=20, we take action a20, but at turn T=20, y20=9, so we have reached, and a20 can be S or something, but we don't need to act, but the sequence includes actions up to the turn before or including?\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t=0 to H-1, at turns t_1 to t_1+H-1, and at turn t_1+H-1, y=9.\n\nSo at turn T=20, y=9, and we have action a20.\n\nIf y20=9, we can have a20=S to stay, or whatever.\n\nIn the above, at T=19, y19=8, a19=U, y20=9.\n\nThen at T=20, y20=9, and we can have a20, but since we reached, it can be S.\n\nBut for the sequence, we need to specify actions until we reach.\n\nIn this case, with a20, but H=13, actions from T=8 to T=20.\n\nBut at T=20, we are already at y=9, so a20 is not necessary for reaching, but we can include it.\n\nTo save actions, we can reach at T=20 with a19=U, and no a20 needed, but the turn we reach is T=20, so action at T=19 sets y20=9.\n\nThen at T=20, we are at y=9, so for the sequence, we include a19, and at turn t_1+H-1=20, y=9.\n\nActions from T=8 to T=19 for 12 actions? Let's count.\n\nT=8 to T=19 inclusive: 8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19: that's 12 actions.\n\nH= number of actions, from t=0 to H-1.\n\nIf actions at T=8 to T=19, that's 12 turns, so t from 0 to 11, H=12.\n\nThen t_1 + H -1 =8 +12 -1=19, but we have y at turn 19 is 8, not 9.\n\nMistake.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn t_1 + H -1, y must be 9.\n\nIn the actions, after H actions, at turn t_1 + H -1, y is 9.\n\nFor example, if H=1, action at t_1, then at turn t_1, y should be 9, but it may not be.\n\nAfter actions from t_1 to t_1+H-1, at turn t_1+H-1, y is set to 9.\n\nIn this case, with actions from T=8 to T=19, H=12, turn t_1+H-1=8+12-1=19, y19 should be 9.\n\nBut in the sequence above, at T=19, y19=8, not 9.\n\nTo have y19=9, we need to be at y=8 at T=18 with U, or something.\n\nLet's set the turn when y=9.\n\nSuppose we reach at turn T, then H = T - t_1 +1\n\nActions from T=8 to T.\n\nFor T=20, H=20-8+1=13, actions at T=8 to T=20? T=8 to T=20 inclusive is 13 actions.\n\nAt T=20, y20=9, so action at T=19 must be from y19=8 with U.\n\ny19=8.\n\nIn the path, from T=12 y=1, after 7 U moves: T=12 U y13=2, T=13 U y14=3, T=14 U y15=4, T=15 U y16=5, T=16 U y17=6, T=17 U y18=7, T=18 U y19=8, then T=19 U y20=9.\n\nSo actions include T=19 U.\n\nThen at T=20, y=9.\n\nActions from T=8 to T=19 for the moves, but T=19 action sets y20.\n\nFor the sequence, actions from t_1 to t_1+H-1, with t_1+H-1=20.\n\nSo actions at T=8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19.\n\nThat's 12 actions for H=12? T=8 to 19 is 12 turns.\n\nList: T=8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19: 12 actions.\n\nThen t_1 + H -1 =8 + H -1 =19, so 7+H=19, H=12.\n\n8+H-1=19, H=12.\n\nThen at turn 19, y19 should be 9, but in this case, with action at T=19, y20=9, so at turn 19, y19=8, not 9.\n\nTo have y at turn T=19 be 9, we need to reach at T=19.\n\nBut from y12=1, to y19=9, need 8 steps, so with actions from T=12 to T=18, 7 actions, y19 <=1+7=8, so y19=8 at best, then at T=19 action U, y20=9, so we reach at T=20.\n\nSo to have y19=9, we need to be at y=9 at T=19, which requires being at y=8 at T=18 with U, but from y12=1 to y18=8 in 6 actions? y12=1, after 6 actions (T=12 to T=17), y18 <=1+6=7, so y18=7, then T=18 U y19=8, T=19 U y20=9, reach at T=20.\n\nCannot reach before T=20 from y12=1.\n\nSimilarly, if we are at y=0 at T=12, worse.\n\nSo min reach at T=20 with H=12 for actions to T=19, but at turn 19 y=8, not 9.\n\nH=13 for T=20.\n\nActions at T=8 to T=19 for the moves to set y20, but the action at T=19 is included, and at turn T=20 y=9.\n\nNumber of actions: from T=8 to T=19 inclusive is 12 actions, but T=19 is the last action, for H actions, turns from t_1 to t_1+H-1.\n\nFor H actions, turns: t_1, t_1+1, ..., t_1+H-1.\n\nSo for t_1=8, actions at 8,9,10, ..., up to 8+H-1.\n\nThen at turn 8+H-1, y=9.\n\nFor turn 8+H-1 =20, so 8+H-1=20, H=13.\n\nActions at T=8 to T=20? T=8 to T=20 is 13 actions.\n\nAt T=20, y20=9, so action at T=19 must be from y19=8 with U.\n\nBut at T=20, we also have action a20, which can be S, for example.\n\nBut it's included.\n\nTo avoid the last action, we can reach at T=19 with y19=9, but we can't from low start.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps we can be at y=1 at T=12, but then move up faster, but impossible.\n\nOr, we can avoid the constraint at T=12 by being at y=7 or 8 at T=12, which is allowed since only y=2-6 forbidden.\n\nAt T=12, we can be on y=7 or 8, since no collision for those freeways at T=12.\n\nFreeway 7 and 8 have collision at T=14 and 15, not at T=12.\n\nAt T=12, freeway 7 and 8 are safe.\n\nOnly freeways 2-6 have collision at T=12.\n\nSo at T=12, we can be on y=7 or 8.\n\nSimilarly, y=0,1,9.\n\nSo we can be at high y at T=12.\n\nFor example, from T=8 y=2, in 4 actions, we can reach y=6.\n\ny at T=12: after actions T=8 to T=11, y12 can be up to 6.\n\ny12=6 is forbidden, but y12=7 not possible because max y12=6.\n\ny8=2, after 4 actions, y12 <=2+4=6, so y12=6 max.\n\nBut y=6 forbidden at T=12, so we cannot be at y=6.\n\ny=5,4,3,2 also forbidden.\n\nOnly y=0,1 allowed, as before.\n\ny=7 not possible to achieve at T=12.\n\nSo no, we must be at y=0 or 1 at T=12.\n\nNo choice.\n\nThus, the minimal H is 13, with reach at T=20.\n\nBut let's confirm the answer format.\n\nPerhaps we can reach at T=19 if we are at y=9, but from y=2 at T=8, to y=9 at T=19, that requires 7 increases in 11 actions, so possible with some stays or down, but we have to be at y=0 or 1 at T=12, which forces us to have net down or stay, so we cannot have net increase by T=12.\n\nFor example, if we are at y=1 at T=12, then to y=9 at T=19, need 8 increases in 7 actions from T=12 to T=18, impossible, 7 actions can increase by at most 7, to y=8 at T=19, then need T=19 U to y20=9.\n\nSo must be T=20.\n\nThus, minimal H is 13.\n\nNow for the sequence, we need to output the actions from T=8 onwards.\n\nBut in the sequence, we can choose how to get to y=1 at T=12.\n\nFor example, one simple way: all stay or down to be at y=1 at T=12 with few down moves.\n\nSince we want min H, but H is fixed at 13 for this path, we can choose the actions.\n\nTo save actions, but we have to take 13 actions anyway.\n\nIn the sequence, we can have the player move up immediately after T=12.\n\nFor example:\n\nTurn 8: D (to y9=1)\n\nTurn 9: S (y10=1)\n\nTurn 10: S (y11=1)\n\nTurn 11: S (y12=1)\n\nTurn 12: U (y13=2)\n\nTurn 13: U (y14=3)\n\nTurn 14: U (y15=4)\n\nTurn 15: U (y16=5)\n\nTurn 16: U (y17=6)\n\nTurn 17: U (y18=7)\n\nTurn 18: U (y19=8)\n\nTurn 19: U (y20=9)\n\nThen at T=20, y=9.\n\nActions from T=8 to T=19, that's 12 actions, but for H, we have turn t_1+H-1=20, so actions up to T=19, but at turn 19, y19=8, not 9.\n\nProblem.\n\nIn this sequence, after action at T=19, y20=9, so at turn 20, y=9.\n\nBut the action at T=19 is the last one in the sequence for H=12? Let's set H.\n\nIf actions at T=8 to T=19, 12 actions, then t_1+H-1=8+12-1=19, so at turn 19, y should be 9, but it is 8.\n\nTo have y at turn T=19 be 9, we need to reach at T=19.\n\nBut from start, with the constraint, we can't.\n\nWith this path, we reach at T=20, so we need to include action at T=19, and at turn 20, y=9, so t_1+H-1=20, H=13, actions at T=8 to T=20.\n\nAt T=20, we need to specify action, but y20=9, so a20 can be S.\n\nSo sequence:\n\nTurn 8: D\n\nTurn 9: S\n\nTurn 10: S\n\nTurn 11: S\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: U  (y20=9)\n\nTurn 20: S  (y21=9, but y20=9, a20=S, y21=9)\n\nBut at turn 20, y=9, so for the sequence, we have action at T=20, which is fine.\n\nTo avoid the extra action, we can reach at T=19, but not possible.\n\nSo with H=13.\n\nBut in the output, we list the actions.\n\nNow, in this sequence, at T=14, y14=3, freeway 3, no collision.\n\nT=15, y15=4, freeway 4, no collision.\n\nT=16, y16=5, etc, all safe.\n\nAlso, at T=12, y12=1, freeway 1, but at T=12, freeway 1 has no collision, only at T=22-25, so ok.\n\nFreeway 1 collision at T=22, etc, not 12.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nPerhaps we can start going up earlier but still be at y=1 at T=12.\n\nFor example:\n\nT=8: S (y9=2)\n\nT=9: D (y10=1)\n\nT=10: S (y11=1)\n\nT=11: S (y12=1)\n\nThen same as above.\n\nOr other variations, but same number of actions.\n\nSo for min H, H=13.\n\nBut let's see if we can reach with less by being at y=9 at T=15 or 16, but we saw it's impossible due to collisions.\n\nSo I think H=13 is minimal.\n\nNow for the answer.\n\nThe actions from turn t_1=8.\n\nSo sequence:\n\nTurn 8: D\n\nTurn 9: S\n\nTurn 10: S\n\nTurn 11: S\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nAnd for turn 20, we need a20, but since we reached, we can set S.\n\nBut in the sequence, it should be included.\n\nTo have only necessary actions, but we need to specify until the reach turn.\n\nIn the format, it should be fine.\n\nPerhaps we can have a shorter sequence by moving down less.\n\nFor example, to be at y=1 at T=12, we can do:\n\nT=8: S (y9=2)\n\nT=9: S (y10=2)\n\nT=10: D (y11=1)\n\nT=11: S (y12=1)\n\nThen T=12: U (y13=2)\n\n...\n\nUp to T=19: U (y20=9)\n\nThen actions T=8 to T=19, 12 actions, but again, at turn t_1+H-1=19, y19=8 if T=19 action, not 9.\n\nTo have y19=9, from above, y12=1, after 7 actions, y19=1+7=8, so at T=19, y19=8, then a19=U, y20=9.\n\nSo we need the action at T=19 to reach at T=20.\n\nThus H=13.\n\nI think it's correct.\n\nSo for the output.\n\nThe sequence of actions for turns from 8 to 20.\n\nBut turn 20 is t_1 + H -1 =20, with H=13.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 8: D\n\nTurn 9: S\n\nTurn 10: S\n\nTurn 11: S\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nTurn 20: S  (to stay at 9)\n\nBut at turn 20, y=9, so action can be S.\n\nIn the sequence, we can omit the last S if not necessary, but the format requires actions until the reach turn.\n\nThe reach turn is T=20, so action at T=20 is included.\n\nTo save an action, but we can't.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps at T=14 and 15, since we are not on y=7 or 8, and we can be at higher y faster if we don't have the T=12 constraint, but we do.\n\nI think H=13 is the best.\n\nSo for the answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 2)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 8\\) is 13. This sequence avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by ensuring the player is not on a colliding freeway at the specified collision times.\n\n### Collision Summary:\n- At turn 12, freeways 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 have collisions, so the player must not be on \\(y = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\).\n- At turns 14 and 15, freeways 7 and 8 have collisions, so the player must not be on \\(y = 7, 8\\).\n- The player must be at \\(y = 0\\) or \\(y = 1\\) at turn 12 to avoid collision, and the path ensures that at turns 14 and 15, the player is below \\(y = 7\\), avoiding those collisions.\n\n### Sequence of Actions:\nThe sequence starts at turn 8 and ends at turn 20, with \\(y = 9\\) reached at turn 20. The actions are chosen to:\n- Move down to \\(y = 1\\) by turn 9 and stay there until turn 12 to satisfy the turn 12 constraint.\n- Move up consistently from turn 12 onwards to reach \\(y = 9\\) as quickly as possible after the constraints.\n\nThe actions are as follows:\n\n- **Turn 8: D** (move down to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 9)  \n- **Turn 9: S** (stay at \\(y = 1\\) at turn 10)  \n- **Turn 10: S** (stay at \\(y = 1\\) at turn 11)  \n- **Turn 11: S** (stay at \\(y = 1\\) at turn 12)  \n- **Turn 12: U** (move up to \\(y = 2\\) at turn 13)  \n- **Turn 13: U** (move up to \\(y = 3\\) at turn 14)  \n- **Turn 14: U** (move up to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 15)  \n- **Turn 15: U** (move up to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 16)  \n- **Turn 16: U** (move up to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 17)  \n- **Turn 17: U** (move up to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 18)  \n- **Turn 18: U** (move up to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 19)  \n- **Turn 19: U** (move up to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 20)  \n- **Turn 20: S** (stay at \\(y = 9\\), as the goal is reached)\n\n### Verification:\n- **At turn 12**: Player is at \\(y = 1\\), which is safe (not colliding).\n- **At turn 14**: Player is at \\(y = 3\\), which is below \\(y = 7\\), so no collision.\n- **At turn 15**: Player is at \\(y = 4\\), which is below \\(y = 7\\), so no collision.\n- The player reaches \\(y = 9\\) at turn 20 with no collisions at any turn.\n\nThis sequence achieves the goal in the minimal \\(H = 13\\) turns.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 8: \\text{D} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: \\text{S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: \\text{S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: \\text{S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: \\text{U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: \\text{U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 14: \\text{U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 15: \\text{U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 16: \\text{U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 17: \\text{U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 18: \\text{U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 19: \\text{U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 20: \\text{S} \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at (0,3) at turn t_1 = 10. The goal is to reach (0,9) in the minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing y by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars are moving on the freeways. For each freeway, there are cars with positions that change over time based on their speed and direction. Collision happens if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T and for some car on that freeway, 0 is within its span at that turn.\n\nImportant point: if the player moves to a new y at turn T, they are not on that new y until the next turn. So at turn T, when they take action, they are still on the current y, and they move to the new position at turn T+1. The collision check is at the turn when they are on the freeway.\n\nFrom the note: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\" And \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nSo, at turn T, the player is on y_T. They choose an action a_T which determines y_{T+1}. The collision is checked at turn T based on y_T and the car spans at T for that freeway. When they move, at T+1, they are on y_{T+1}, and collision is checked based on y_{T+1} and spans at T+1.\n\nNow, the car spans are given at turn t_1=10, and I need to find where they are at future turns.\n\nLet me list all the cars at t_1=10.\n\nFreeway 1: one car, head -36, tail -47, direction right, speed 3. Since it's right-moving, head is greater than tail? The notation says for right-moving: Span(t_1) = [τ, h], so τ is tail, h is head, and since it's moving right, positions increase.\n\nFor left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] with h > τ, I assume, since it's decreasing.\n\nIn this case, all cars seem to be right-moving, except I need to check.\n\nFreeway 1: (-36, -47, right, 3). But for right-moving, it should be [τ, h], so here it's given as (head, tail, dir, speed), but head and tail might be confused.\n\nLook: \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nAnd for right-moving: \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h]\" so τ is the left end, h is the right end.\n\nBut in the input, for freeway 1: head h = -36, tail τ = -47, direction right.\n\nSince it's right-moving, [τ, h] should be such that τ ≤ h, but here τ = -47, h = -36, so -47 to -36, which makes sense, τ is smaller, h is larger, so [τ, h] = [-47, -36].\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, it would be [h, τ] with h > τ.\n\nIn this case, all cars are right-moving except I need to see.\n\nFreeway 6 has two cars, both right.\n\nFreeway 7 and 8 also.\n\nAll cars are right-moving.\n\nNow, for each car, at turn T, the span is [τ + s(T - t_1), h + s(T - t_1)] for right-moving cars.\n\nSince direction right, and speed s, so position increases by s per turn.\n\nt_1 = 10.\n\nLet me denote Δt = T - t_1, so for turn T, Δt = T - 10.\n\nThen for a right-moving car, span at T is [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt]\n\nSimilarly for left, but no left here.\n\nNow, collision occurs at turn T if player is on freeway y_T, and for some car on that freeway, 0 is in [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] at that T.\n\nSince y_T is the row, and we care about the x-position 0.\n\nPlayer starts at y=3 at t=10.\n\nGoal is to reach y=9.\n\ny from 0 to 9, freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars, I assume. The freeways are only y=1 to 8 for cars, so y=0 and y=9 should be safe positions where no collision can happen.\n\nThe player can be at y=0 or y=9 without issue.\n\nNow, we need to move from y=3 to y=9, so we need to go up through y=4,5,6,7,8 to reach y=9.\n\nBut we might need to stay or move down to avoid cars.\n\nMinimal moves: since we need to increase y from 3 to 9, that's 6 steps up, but we might have to wait or detour due to cars.\n\nH is the number of turns, including the actions.\n\nWe start at t=10, position y=3.\n\nAfter H turns, meaning after actions from t=10 to t=10+H-1, we reach y=9 at turn t=10+H-1.\n\nLet me set t_abs = turn number.\n\nt_start = t_1 = 10.\n\nPlayer at (0,3) at t=10.\n\nWe perform actions a_{10}, a_{11}, ..., up to some t, such that at that turn, y=9.\n\nThe position after action determines the next state.\n\nAt turn t, player is at y_t.\n\nThen they choose a_t, which sets y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, with Δy based on a_t.\n\nThen at turn t+1, they are at y_{t+1}.\n\nCollision is checked at each turn t based on y_t and the car spans on freeway y_t at time t.\n\nFor freeway y_t, if there is a car such that 0 is in its span at time t, collision occurs.\n\nWe need no collision at all turns from t=10 to when we reach y=9.\n\nAt t=10, we are at y=3, so we need to check if at t=10, on y=3, if there is a car with 0 in span.\n\nBut y=3 is a freeway, freeway k=3.\n\nFreeways: k=1 to 8 correspond to y=1 to 8, I assume? The freeway index is k, which should be the y-coordinate.\n\nIn the table, freeway k, so for y=k, I think.\n\nFreeway 1 is y=1, freeway 2 is y=2, and so on up to freeway 8 is y=8.\n\nAt t=10, player at y=3, so on freeway 3.\n\nNow, for freeway 3, cars: from table, freeway 3 has: (-24, -35, right, 12)\n\nOne car: head h=-24, tail τ=-35, direction right, speed 12.\n\nAt t=10, span: for right-moving, [τ, h] = [-35, -24]\n\nNow, is 0 in [-35, -24]? -35 to -24, all negative, so 0 not in there, so no collision at t=10. Good.\n\nWe need to get to y=9. Since y=9 is safe, we can be there.\n\nBut to reach y=9, we need to pass through the freeways.\n\nNow, let's list the car configurations for each freeway at t=10.\n\nFreeway k=1: cars: (-36, -47, right, 3) → span [τ, h] = [-47, -36] since right-moving.\n\nFreeway k=2: (-24, -35, right, 12) → span [-35, -24]\n\nFreeway k=3: same as k=2, (-24, -35, right, 12) → [-35, -24]\n\nFreeway k=4: same, (-24, -35, right, 12) → [-35, -24]\n\nFreeway k=5: same, (-24, -35, right, 12) → [-35, -24]\n\nFreeway k=6: two cars: first (-24, -35, right, 12) → [-35, -24], and second (48, 37, right, 12)? Head 48, tail 37? For right-moving, it should be [τ, h], so if head=48, tail=37, then [37,48]? But tail should be left, head right.\n\nIn the input, it says (head h, tail τ), so for right, τ is left, h is right.\n\nHere, first car: h=-24, τ=-35, so [τ, h] = [-35,-24]\n\nSecond car: (48,37,right,12), so h=48, τ=37, so [τ, h] = [37,48]\n\nBoth on freeway 6.\n\nFreeway k=7: two cars: first (-24, -35, right, 6) → [τ, h] = [-35,-24], and second (24,13,right,6) → [13,24]\n\nSpeed 6 for both.\n\nFreeway k=8: same as k=7: (-24,-35,right,6) → [-35,-24], and (24,13,right,6) → [13,24]\n\nNow, for each freeway, at time t, the span of each car is [τ + s*(t-10), h + s*(t-10)] for right-moving cars.\n\nWe need to find when 0 is covered for each freeway.\n\nThat is, for a given freeway k and time t, if there is a car such that min_span <= 0 <= max_span, where min_span and max_span depend on the car and t.\n\nSince all cars are right-moving, for each car, the span is [left(t), right(t)] = [τ + s(t-10), h + s(t-10)]\n\nThen 0 is covered if left(t) <= 0 <= right(t)\n\nWhich is equivalent to left(t) <= 0 and right(t) >= 0.\n\nNow, for each freeway, I can find the times when 0 is covered, i.e., unsafe times.\n\nThen the player must not be on that freeway at those times.\n\nSince we need to go from y=3 to y=9, and we can move up, down, or stay, we need to find a path through time and row.\n\ny from 0 to 9, but y=0 and y=9 are safe always, no cars.\n\nFreeways y=1 to 8 have cars.\n\nAt any time, if player is on y=1 to 8, we need to ensure that at that time, for that y, 0 is not covered by any car.\n\nOtherwise safe.\n\nNow, let's find for each y, the set of times when it is unsafe.\n\nStart with y=1 (freeway 1).\n\nCars: only one car: τ=-47, h=-36, s=3\n\nleft(t) = -47 + 3(t-10)\n\nright(t) = -36 + 3(t-10)\n\n0 covered if left(t) <= 0 <= right(t)\n\nSo -47 + 3(t-10) <= 0 and -36 + 3(t-10) >= 0\n\nFirst inequality: -47 + 3(t-10) <= 0 => 3(t-10) <= 47 => t-10 <= 47/3 ≈ 15.666, so t <= 10 + 15.666 = 25.666, so t <= 25 since integer?\n\nt is integer turn, I assume.\n\nt-10 integer.\n\nSimilarly, second inequality: -36 + 3(t-10) >= 0 => 3(t-10) >= 36 => t-10 >= 12 => t >= 22\n\nNow, left(t) <= 0 for t <= 25.666, so since t integer, t <= 25\n\nright(t) >= 0 for t >= 22\n\nSo 0 covered when both, so t >=22 and t<=25, so t=22,23,24,25\n\nFor t=22: left(22) = -47 + 3(12) = -47 + 36 = -11 <=0, right(22)= -36 + 36 =0 >=0, so yes, 0 covered.\n\nt=23: left= -47+3(13)= -47+39= -8 <=0, right=-36+39=3>=0\n\nt=24: left=-47+42= -5<=0, right=-36+42=6>=0\n\nt=25: left=-47+45= -2<=0, right=-36+45=9>=0\n\nt=26: left=-47+48=1 >0? left=1>0, so 0 not <= left, so not covered.\n\nSimilarly, t=21: left=-47+3(11)= -47+33= -14 <=0, right=-36+33= -3 <0, so 0 not >= right, not covered.\n\nSo unsafe for y=1 at t=22,23,24,25\n\nNow y=2: freeway 2, car: τ=-35, h=-24, s=12\n\nleft(t) = -35 + 12(t-10)\n\nright(t) = -24 + 12(t-10)\n\n0 covered if left <=0 and right>=0\n\nleft <=0: -35 +12(t-10) <=0 => 12(t-10) <=35 => t-10 <= 35/12 ≈ 2.916, so t <= 10 + 2 = 12? 35/12=2.916, so t-10 <= 2.916, t <= 12.916, so t <=12\n\nt integer, t-10 <= floor(35/12)=2? 12*2=24, 35-24=11, so 35/12=2 + 11/12, so t-10 <= 2.916, so for integer, t-10 <=2, since 3>2.916? t-10 <= floor(2.916)=2? Let's see:\n\n-35 +12(Δt) <=0 => 12(Δt) <=35 => Δt <= 35/12 ≈ 2.916, so Δt <=2 since Δt integer? Δt = t-10\n\nΔt <=2.916, so for Δt=0,1,2: left <=0\n\nΔt=0: left=-35<=0, right=-24<=0? right=-24<0, so not covered.\n\nWe need both left<=0 and right>=0.\n\nleft <=0: Δt <= 35/12 ≈2.916, so Δt <=2\n\nright >=0: -24 +12(Δt) >=0 => 12(Δt) >=24 => Δt >=2\n\nSo Δt >=2 and Δt <=2, so Δt=2\n\nThus t-10=2, t=12\n\nAt t=12, left= -35 +12(2)= -35+24= -11 <=0, right= -24 +24=0 >=0, so 0 covered.\n\nOther times not.\n\nFor example Δt=1: left=-35+12= -23<=0, right=-24+12= -12<0, not covered.\n\nΔt=3: left=-35+36=1>0, not <=0.\n\nSo only unsafe at t=12 for y=2.\n\nNow y=3: similar to y=2, same car: τ=-35,h=-24,s=12\n\nSo same as above, only unsafe at t=12.\n\ny=4: same, one car like y=2, unsafe only at t=12.\n\ny=5: same, unsafe only at t=12.\n\nNow y=6: freeway 6, two cars.\n\nFirst car: τ=-35,h=-24,s=12, same as before, so unsafe when? For this car, left<=0 and right>=0 only at t=12, as above.\n\nBut there is another car: (48,37,right,12), head=48, tail=37, so τ=37, h=48, s=12\n\nThen left(t) = 37 + 12(t-10)\n\nright(t) = 48 + 12(t-10)\n\nNow, 0 covered if left <=0 and right >=0.\n\nBut left(t) = 37 + 12(Δt) , since Δt >=0, left(t) >=37 >0, so left(t) >0 always, never <=0, so 0 never covered by this car because it starts at 37 and moves right, so always positive, 0 not in span.\n\nSimilarly, right(t) >=48>0 always.\n\nSo this car never covers 0.\n\nTherefore, for y=6, only the first car matters, which is unsafe only at t=12.\n\nSo same as others.\n\nNow y=7: freeway 7, two cars.\n\nFirst car: (-24,-35,right,6) → τ=-35, h=-24, s=6\n\nSecond car: (24,13,right,6) → τ=13, h=24, s=6\n\nFirst car: left(t) = -35 + 6(t-10)\n\nright(t) = -24 + 6(t-10)\n\n0 covered if left<=0 and right>=0\n\nleft<=0: -35 +6(Δt) <=0 => 6(Δt) <=35 => Δt <= 35/6 ≈ 5.833, so Δt <=5\n\nright>=0: -24 +6(Δt) >=0 => 6(Δt) >=24 => Δt >=4\n\nSo Δt >=4 and Δt <=5, so Δt=4,5\n\nt-10=4 or 5, so t=14 or 15\n\nFor Δt=4: left= -35 +24= -11 <=0, right= -24+24=0 >=0\n\nΔt=5: left= -35+30= -5 <=0, right= -24+30=6 >=0\n\nNow second car: τ=13, h=24, s=6\n\nleft(t)=13 +6(Δt) >=13>0 always, so never <=0, so 0 never covered by this car.\n\nThus for y=7, unsafe at t=14 and t=15.\n\nNow y=8: same as y=7, because cars are identical: (-24,-35,right,6) and (24,13,right,6), same as y=7.\n\nSo unsafe at t=14 and 15.\n\nSummary of unsafe times for each y:\n\ny=1: unsafe at t=22,23,24,25\n\ny=2: unsafe at t=12\n\ny=3: unsafe at t=12\n\ny=4: unsafe at t=12\n\ny=5: unsafe at t=12\n\ny=6: unsafe at t=12 (only from first car)\n\ny=7: unsafe at t=14,15\n\ny=8: unsafe at t=14,15\n\nAnd y=0 and y=9 always safe.\n\nPlayer starts at t=10, y=3.\n\nAt t=10, y=3 is safe, as we saw earlier.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nMinimal H: since we need to go from y=3 to y=9, the minimum steps without obstacles is 6 up moves, so H=6 turns: actions at t=10 to t=15, positions at t=10:y=3, t=11:y=4, ..., t=15:y=8? Let's see the timeline.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t.\n\nt=10: y=3\n\nAfter action a_10, y_11 = y_10 + Δy\n\nThen at t=11, position y_11, and so on.\n\nAfter H actions, from t=10 to t=10+H-1, we have y at t=10+H-1.\n\nWe want y_{t} =9 for some t.\n\nSpecifically, when we first reach y=9, we can stop, I assume, but we need to be at (0,9), so as long as we are there, it's fine.\n\nBut in the sequence, we need to reach and stop, I think.\n\nThe goal is to have y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nStarting at t=10, after H turns, meaning H actions, we end at turn t=10 + H -1 with y=9.\n\nFor example, if we move up each turn, at t=10: y=3, a10=U, then t=11: y=4, a11=U, t=12:y=5, ..., up to t=15:y=6? t=10:y=3, after U, t=11:y=4, U, t=12:y=5, U, t=13:y=6, U, t=14:y=7, U, t=15:y=8, U, t=16:y=9. So to reach y=9 at t=16, which is after 6 actions: from t=10 to t=15, H=6, t=10+H-1=10+6-1=15? t=10 to t=15 is 6 actions, but at t=15, after action, y=9? Let's index.\n\nAt time t, before action, position is y_t.\n\nAfter choosing a_t, y_{t+1} is set.\n\nSo at t=10, position y_10=3.\n\nAfter a_10, y_11 = y_10 + Δy.\n\nAt t=11, position y_11, and so on.\n\nTo have y_t =9 for some t.\n\nThe turn when we are at y=9.\n\nIn the sequence, we perform actions until we reach y=9.\n\nIn the minimal path, we might reach at t=10 + H -1.\n\nWith all U, from y=3 to y=9, it takes 6 moves: after 6 U actions, we go to y=9 at t=16.\n\nt=10: start y=3\n\na10=U → y11=4\n\na11=U → y12=5\n\na12=U → y13=6\n\na13=U → y14=7\n\na14=U → y15=8\n\na15=U → y16=9\n\nSo at t=16, y=9, and H=6 actions from t=10 to t=15.\n\nt=10 to t=15 inclusive is 6 actions.\n\nBut we need to check for collisions during the path.\n\nNow, in this path, we are on:\n\nt=10: y=3, safe as we saw\n\nt=11: y=4, now at t=11, y=4 is freeway 4, which is unsafe at t=12? We need to check at each t, the y_t and if unsafe at that t.\n\nt=11: y=4\n\nFreeway y=4, unsafe only at t=12, as per earlier.\n\nAt t=11, Δt = t-10=1\n\nFor y=4 car: τ=-35,h=-24,s=12\n\nleft(t) = -35 +12(1) = -23\n\nright(t) = -24 +12(1) = -12\n\nBoth negative, 0 not covered, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, t=12: y=5? In the path above, at t=12, y=5 (since from t=11 y=4, U to y=5 at t=12)\n\ny=5 at t=12.\n\nBut y=5 is unsafe at t=12, exactly.\n\nAt t=12, for y=5, car has left=-35+12(2)= -35+24= -11, right=-24+24=0, so 0 covered, collision!\n\nOh, so in the straight up path, at t=12, we are on y=5, which is unsafe, collision.\n\nSo we need to avoid that.\n\nWe could stay or move down to avoid being on y=2,3,4,5,6 at t=12.\n\ny=2,3,4,5,6 all unsafe at t=12.\n\ny=1 is unsafe later, y=7 and 8 unsafe at t=14,15.\n\nWe need to not be on rows 2-6 at t=12.\n\nSimilarly, not on rows 7-8 at t=14 and 15.\n\nPlayer at t=10: y=3\n\nWe need to choose actions so that at t=12, we are not on y=2,3,4,5,6.\n\nSince we start at y=3, t=10.\n\nt=10: y=3\n\nAfter a10, y11 = y10 + da, where da = -1,0,1 for D,S,U.\n\nThen at t=11, y11.\n\nThen after a11, y12, and so on.\n\nWe need y12 not in {2,3,4,5,6}, because all these are unsafe at t=12.\n\ny=1 is safe at t=12, y=7 and 8 safe at t=12, but y=7 and 8 unsafe later.\n\nAt t=12, y=1 is safe because unsafe only at t=22-25.\n\ny=7: unsafe at t=14,15, so at t=12, safe.\n\nSimilarly y=8 safe at t=12.\n\ny=0 and y=9 always safe.\n\nSo at t=12, we can be on y=0,1,7,8,9.\n\nBut we are at y=3 at t=10.\n\nFrom t=10 to t=12, we have two actions: a10 and a11.\n\nAfter a10, we set y11.\n\nAfter a11, we set y12.\n\nWe need y12 to be in {0,1,7,8,9}, but since y=9 might be far, or y=0.\n\ny11 can be anything, but we need to avoid collision at t=11 as well.\n\nFirst, at t=10: y=3, safe.\n\nNow t=11: whatever y11 we are on, must be safe at t=11.\n\nFor y=1 at t=11: Δt=1, left=-47+3(1)= -44, right=-36+3= -33, both <0, 0 not covered, safe.\n\ny=2 at t=11: Δt=1, left=-35+12= -23, right=-24+12= -12, both <0, safe.\n\nSimilarly y=3: same, safe at t=11.\n\ny=4: safe at t=11, as above.\n\ny=5: safe.\n\ny=6: safe at t=11.\n\ny=7: at t=11, Δt=1, first car left=-35+6= -29, right=-24+6= -18, both <0, safe; second car left=13+6=19>0, safe.\n\ny=8: similar, safe.\n\ny=0 and y=9 safe.\n\nSo at t=11, all y are safe, since for rows 1-8, at t=11, no car covers 0, as per the unsafe times.\n\nFor example, y=1 unsafe only t=22-25, t=11 early.\n\ny=2 only t=12, etc.\n\nSo t=11, all freeways are safe.\n\nSimilarly, t=10 safe.\n\nNow t=12 critical.\n\nWe need y12 not in {2,3,4,5,6}.\n\ny12 must be 0,1,7,8,9.\n\nBut from y10=3, after two actions, possible y12.\n\ny12 = y10 + da10 + da11, where each da is -1,0,1.\n\nSo y12 = 3 + Δy10 + Δy11\n\nSince we start at t=10, after a10, y11 = 3 + da10\n\nThen after a11, y12 = y11 + da11 = (3 + da10) + da11\n\nSo y12 = 3 + da10 + da11\n\nda10 and da11 each in {-1,0,1}\n\nSo y12 can be from 3-1-1=1 to 3+1+1=5.\n\nMin y12: if both D, y12=3-1-1=1\n\nMax: both U, y12=3+1+1=5\n\nSo possible y12: 1,2,3,4,5\n\nBut we need y12 in {0,1,7,8,9}, but from above, y12 can only be between 1 and 5, so only y=1 is possible in the safe set for t=12.\n\ny=1 is safe at t=12, as we said.\n\ny=0 not reachable since min y12=1.\n\ny=7,8,9 not reachable in two steps from y=3, max to y=5.\n\nSo only possibility is to have y12=1.\n\nThus, we must go down to y=1 at t=12.\n\nWith two actions, from y=3 to y=1.\n\ny12=1.\n\nNow, y12=1, which is safe at t=12.\n\nNow, how to get there.\n\ny11 = y10 + da10\n\nThen y12 = y11 + da11\n\ny12=1, y10=3.\n\nSo 1 = 3 + da10 + da11\n\nThus da10 + da11 = -2\n\nSince each da <=0, must be da10 = -1 (D), da11 = -1 (D)\n\nThen y11 = y10 + da10 = 3 -1 =2\n\ny12 = y11 + da11 = 2 -1 =1\n\nNow, at t=11, y=2, which is safe, as we said.\n\nAt t=12, y=1, safe.\n\nNow, we are at t=12, y=1.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nBut y=1 is safe for now, but unsafe later at t=22-25, but that's far, we can leave before.\n\nNow, from here, we need to go up.\n\nBut we have to avoid the unsafe times for other rows.\n\nSpecifically, y=7 and 8 unsafe at t=14 and 15.\n\nNow, t=12, y=1.\n\nWe can start moving up.\n\nBut to reach y=9, we need to go through y=2,3,4,5,6,7,8.\n\ny=2 to 6 are only unsafe at t=12, which has passed, so they are safe at other times.\n\nSimilarly, y=1 unsafe only at t=22-25, which is later.\n\ny=7 and 8 unsafe at t=14 and 15.\n\nSo we need to not be on y=7 or 8 at t=14 or t=15.\n\nNow, let's plan the path from t=12, y=1.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nMinimal moves: from y=1 to y=9, need 8 up moves, but we can do with stays or something.\n\nBut we have time constraints.\n\nSince y=7 and 8 are unsafe at t=14 and 15, we should avoid being on them at those times.\n\nWe can be on them before or after.\n\nt=12: y=1\n\nt=13: after action, y13\n\nt=14: y14\n\nt=15: y15\n\netc.\n\nWe need to ensure that if y14=7 or 8, it might be unsafe if at that time.\n\nSimilarly for y15.\n\nNow, unsafe times: for y=7 and 8, unsafe at t=14 and t=15.\n\nSo if we are on y=7 or 8 at t=14 or t=15, collision.\n\nTherefore, we must not be on y=7 or 8 at t=14 and not at t=15.\n\nThat means, at t=14, y14 should not be 7 or 8, so y14 <=6 or y14=9? y=9 safe, but y=9 is above.\n\ny=0-6 or 9 at t=14.\n\nSimilarly at t=15, y15 not 7 or 8, so y15 <=6 or y15=9.\n\nBut we want to reach y=9, so ideally we go up.\n\nNow from t=12, y=1.\n\nWe can go up as fast as possible, but need to check the times.\n\nLet me list possible actions.\n\nSet t=12: position y=1\n\nNow, we want to minimize turns to reach y=9.\n\nBut with constraints.\n\nFirst, without constraints, from y=1 to y=9, min 8 U moves.\n\nBut we might need to wait.\n\nNow, t=12: y=1\n\nAfter a12, y13 = y12 + da12\n\nThen a13, y14\n\na14, y15\n\netc.\n\nWe need to avoid y14 and y15 being 7 or 8.\n\nBecause if y14=7 or 8, and t=14, collision.\n\nSimilarly for t=15.\n\nNow, also, for other rows, no problem except y=1 unsafe at t=22-25, but t=22 is later, we can reach y=9 before that.\n\nt=12 to t=22 is 10 turns, plenty of time to go up 8 rows.\n\nBut we have the t=14,15 issue.\n\nNow, let's see possible y at t=14 and t=15.\n\nt=12: y=1\n\nAfter one action a12, t=13: y13 = y12 + da12 = 1 + da12, so y13 can be 0,1,2\n\nAfter a13, t=14: y14 = y13 + da13\n\nAfter a14, t=15: y15 = y14 + da14\n\nWe need y14 not 7 or 8, but y14 can only be from y13 + da13, and y13 is at most 2, so y14 <= 2 +1 =3, since da <=1.\n\nSimilarly, min y14= y13 -1, but y13 min 0, so y14 >= -1, but y>=0, so y14=0,1,2,3.\n\nSimilarly, y15 from y14 + da14, so y15 between 0 and 4.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9, which is higher, so we must go up eventually.\n\nBut at t=14 and t=15, we are stuck in low y, because from t=12 y=1, by t=15, we can be at most y=1 +3 =4 if all U, but let's see:\n\nt=12: y=1\n\na12=U → y13=2\n\na13=U → y14=3\n\na14=U → y15=4\n\ny15=4\n\nBut we need y=9, far away.\n\nWe are only at y=4 at t=15.\n\nBut y=7 and 8 unsafe at t=14 and 15, but since we are below, no problem for now.\n\nBut we need to go up to y=9.\n\nFrom here, we can continue up.\n\nBut at t=15, y=4, safe.\n\nThen a15=U → y16=5\n\na16=U → y17=6\n\na17=U → y18=7\n\nBut at t=18, y=7, now we need to check if safe.\n\nt=18, for y=7.\n\nEarlier, y=7 unsafe at t=14 and 15.\n\nAt t=18, Δt=18-10=8\n\nFor y=7, first car: left(t)= -35 +6(8)= -35+48=13, right= -24+48=24\n\n13 to 24, both positive, 0 not covered.\n\nSecond car: left=13+6(8)=13+48=61, right=24+48=72, both >0, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=8 same.\n\nAnd y=1 unsafe only t=22-25, so at t=18, safe.\n\nSo we can go up freely.\n\nFrom t=15 y=4:\n\na15=U → y16=5\n\na16=U → y17=6\n\na17=U → y18=7\n\na18=U → y19=8\n\na19=U → y20=9\n\nSo reach y=9 at t=20.\n\nH actions: from t=10 to t=19? Let's list all.\n\nWe started from t=10.\n\nt=10: y=3, a10=D → y11=2 (since we go down)\n\nEarlier: to avoid t=12, we did a10=D, a11=D, to y12=1.\n\nt=10: y=3, a10=D → y11=2\n\nt=11: y=2, a11=D → y12=1\n\nt=12: y=1, now from here.\n\na12=U → y13=2\n\nt=13: y=2, a13=U → y14=3\n\nt=14: y=3, a14=U → y15=4\n\nt=15: y=4, a15=U → y16=5\n\nt=16: y=5, a16=U → y17=6\n\nt=17: y=6, a17=U → y18=7\n\nt=18: y=7, a18=U → y19=8\n\nt=19: y=8, a19=U → y20=9\n\nSo at t=20, y=9.\n\nNumber of actions: from t=10 to t=19, that's 10 actions? t=10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19: 10 actions.\n\nH is the number of turns, so actions at t=10 to t=10+H-1.\n\nWe reach at t=20 = 10 + H -1, so 10 + H -1 =20, so H=11.\n\nBut we can do better? This seems slow.\n\nWe were at y=1 at t=12, and we took many steps to go up.\n\nBut we could go up faster later, but still.\n\nPerhaps we can avoid going down to y=1.\n\nEarlier I thought we must have y12=1, but is there another way?\n\nAt t=12, we must not be on y=2,3,4,5,6.\n\nFrom y=3 at t=10, with two actions, y12 can only be 1,2,3,4,5.\n\ny=1 is the only safe one at t=12.\n\nBut y=0 is also safe, but we cannot reach y=0 from y=3 in two steps? Min y12=1, as above, cannot go below y=0? y cannot be negative, so from y=3, with two down, y=1, cannot go to 0.\n\ny=0: if we go down twice, from y=3, a10=D, y11=2, a11=D, y12=1, cannot go below.\n\nUnless we go down once and stay, but y12=3 + da10 + da11, min with da=-1,0, so if da10=-1, da11=0, y11=2, y12=2; or da10=0, da11=-1, y11=3, y12=2; or both -1, y12=1. Cannot get y=0.\n\nSimilarly, y=9 not reachable.\n\nSo indeed, only y=1 possible at t=12.\n\nBut at t=12, y=1 is safe.\n\nNow, from there, to reach y=9 faster, we need to go up, but we have the issue with y=7 and 8 at t=14,15.\n\nIn the above path, we were at low y at t=14 and t=15, so no problem, but we reached slowly.\n\nSince y=7 and 8 are unsafe only at t=14 and 15, we can be on them before or after.\n\nFor example, we can be on y=7 at t=13 or t=16, etc.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nSo from t=12 y=1, we can go up faster to higher y earlier or later.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9.\n\nLet me find a way to reach y=9 earlier.\n\nMinimal time: from t=12 y=1, to y=9, need at least 8 up moves, so at least 8 actions after t=12.\n\nAfter a12 to a19, y20=9, as above.\n\nBut we started from t=10.\n\nt=10 to t=12 we used two actions to go down.\n\nTotal actions: from t=10 to t=19, 10 actions, reach at t=20.\n\nBut perhaps we can reduce by going up immediately after t=12.\n\nFor example, if we go all up from t=12: a12=U, y13=2; a13=U, y14=3; a14=U, y15=4; ... but y15=4, then to y16=5, y17=6, y18=7, y19=8, y20=9, same as before.\n\nBut at t=14, y14=3, safe; t=15, y15=4, safe, no issue.\n\nBut we need to pass through y=7 and 8, which we do at t=18 and t=19, which are after t=15, so safe.\n\nt=18>15, so safe.\n\nBut can we reach earlier?\n\nFrom y=1 at t=12, after k actions, we can be at y=1 + sum da, but to reach y=9, need sum of 8 U, so minimum 8 actions, so at t=12 + 8 = t=20, y=9.\n\nt=12: position, after a12, y13; ... after a19, y20.\n\nSo earliest at t=20.\n\nWith the initial two down actions, we reach y=9 at t=20.\n\nBut is there a way to reach before t=20?\n\nAt t=10, y=3, if we don't go down, but we have to avoid t=12 on y=2-6.\n\nBut we cannot, as we must be at y=1 at t=12.\n\nPerhaps we can go to y=7 or 8 before t=14.\n\nBut from t=10 y=3, to reach y=7 quickly.\n\nFor example, all up: a10=U, y11=4; a11=U, y12=5; but at t=12, y=5, unsafe! Collision.\n\nNot possible.\n\na10=S, y11=3; a11=S, y12=3; but y=3 unsafe at t=12.\n\na10=U, y11=4; a11=S, y12=4, unsafe.\n\na10=D, y11=2; a11=S, y12=2, unsafe.\n\na10=S, y11=3; a11=D, y12=2, unsafe.\n\nThe only safe is to go to y=1 at t=12, as before.\n\nSo we must do that.\n\nNow from y=1 at t=12, we need to reach y=9.\n\nBut with y=7 and 8 unsafe at t=14 and 15.\n\nt=14 and 15 are soon after t=12.\n\nAt t=12, y=1.\n\nIf we go up as fast as possible: a12=U, y13=2; a13=U, y14=3; a14=U, y15=4; etc.\n\nAt t=14, y14=3; t=15, y15=4; both below 7, so safe.\n\nThen we continue to y=9 at t=20.\n\nBut at t=14, y=3, which is fine.\n\nBut we could go up slower to be at higher y later, but that might not help.\n\nSince y=7 and 8 are safe before t=14 and after t=15, we can aim to be on them at t=13 or t=16, etc.\n\nFor example, at t=13, y= something.\n\nBut from t=12 y=1, to be at y=7 at t=13? Impossible, since one action, y13 <= y12 +1 =2.\n\nSimilarly, y=8 not possible.\n\nTo be at y=7 at t=16: from t=12 y=1, need to increase by 6 in 4 actions? From t=12 to t=16, that's actions a12,a13,a14,a15, setting y13,y14,y15,y16.\n\ny16 = y12 + da12 + da13 + da14 + da15 = 1 + sum da, each da <=1, so max y16=1+4=5, cannot reach y=7.\n\ny17=1 + max 5=6, y18=7, etc.\n\nSo cannot be on y=7 before t=18, as in previous path.\n\nt=18 is after t=15, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, no way to be on y=7 earlier.\n\nSo the path we have is necessary.\n\nBut let's confirm the time to reach.\n\nt=10: y=3, a10=D → y11=2\n\nt=11: y=2, a11=D → y12=1\n\nt=12: y=1, a12=U → y13=2\n\nt=13: y=2, a13=U → y14=3\n\nt=14: y=3, a14=U → y15=4\n\nt=15: y=4, a15=U → y16=5\n\nt=16: y=5, a16=U → y17=6\n\nt=17: y=6, a17=U → y18=7\n\nt=18: y=7, a18=U → y19=8\n\nt=19: y=8, a19=U → y20=9\n\nAt t=20, y=9.\n\nNumber of actions: from t=10 to t=19, that's 10 actions.\n\nH=10.\n\nReach at turn t=20 = t_1 + H -1 = 10 + H -1, so 10 + H -1 =20, H=11? Let's see.\n\nt_1 =10, we perform actions for t=10 to t=10+H-1.\n\nAfter H actions, we are at turn t=10+H-1 with y=9.\n\nHere, at t=20, y=9, and t=20 =10 + H -1, so 10 + H -1 =20, thus H=11.\n\nActions at t=10 to t=19, that's 10 actions? t=10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19: 10 actions.\n\nt=10 to t=19 inclusive is 10 turns? Number of actions: from first to last, number is last - first +1.\n\nt=10 to t=19: 19-10+1=10 actions.\n\nThen at turn t=20, position is after last action.\n\nIn terms of turns, at turn t=20, we are at y=9, which is the state after action a19.\n\nThe sequence is from t=10 to t=19, H=10 actions.\n\nt=10+H-1=19? Then at t=19, we set y20, but at turn t=19, we are at y19, then after a19, y20 is set.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t.\n\nAfter a_t, y_{t+1} is determined.\n\nAt turn t=19, position y19=8 (from above), then a19=U, so y20=9.\n\nThen at turn t=20, position y20=9.\n\nSo we reach position (0,9) at turn t=20.\n\nAnd we performed actions from t=10 to t=19.\n\nSo H=10.\n\nNow, is there a shorter way?\n\nPerhaps we can reach y=9 faster by not going down, but we have to avoid the collision at t=12.\n\nAnother idea: we could stay at y=3 until after t=12, but at t=12, y=3 is unsafe, so we cannot be there.\n\nWe must leave before or after, but since we start at t=10, and t=12 is only two steps away, we can only go to y=1,2,4,5, but y=2,4,5 all unsafe at t=12, only y=1 safe.\n\ny=3 unsafe.\n\nSo no choice.\n\nPerhaps go up to y=6 or something, but y=6 also unsafe at t=12.\n\nAll y=2-6 unsafe.\n\nSo only y=1 possible at t=12.\n\nNow, from y=1, we need to go up, but we can go faster if we don't have the y=7,8 constraint, but in this case, since we are slow, we avoid the unsafe times for y=7,8 automatically.\n\nBut to save time, perhaps we can reach a safe row faster.\n\nAnother thought: after t=12, since y=2-6 are safe after t=12, we can go up quickly.\n\nBut from y=1 to y=9, min 8 steps, so at least t=20.\n\nBut let's see if we can reach before t=20.\n\nFor example, from t=12 y=1, if we could go up multiple steps, but we can only change by 1 per turn.\n\nUnless we stay, but staying doesn't help to go up.\n\nSo no, 8 steps needed.\n\nBut at t=10, we are at y=3, which is closer to 9 than y=1.\n\nBut due to the t=12 constraint, we go down, so we are farther.\n\nBut we have to.\n\nPerhaps we can go to y=0 or something, but y=0 not reachable, and not necessary.\n\nSo I think H=10 is minimal.\n\nBut let's confirm if we can reach earlier with different path.\n\nSuppose at t=10, we go up: a10=U, y11=4\n\nBut at t=11, y=4 is safe, as we said.\n\nThen at t=11, if we go down, a11=D, y12=3, but y=3 unsafe at t=12? At t=12, y=3, unsafe.\n\nIf a11=S, y12=4, unsafe.\n\nIf a11=U, y12=5, unsafe.\n\nAll unsafe at t=12.\n\nSo we must not be on y=4 at t=12 if we are there, but we are forced to be on one of them.\n\nUnless we go down at t=10.\n\na10=D, y11=2\n\nThen at t=11, y=2, safe.\n\nThen a11: if U, y12=3, unsafe; if S, y12=2, unsafe; if D, y12=1, safe.\n\nSo only D is safe.\n\nThus, the only safe path is to go down twice to y=1 at t=12.\n\nThen go up step by step to y=9 at t=20.\n\nNow, about y=7 and 8 unsafe at t=14,15, but in this path, we are not on them until t=18,19, which is after, so fine.\n\nNow, the sequence:\n\nStart t=10: position y=3, action a10 = D (down) to go to y=2\n\nt=11: y=2, action a11 = D to go to y=1\n\nt=12: y=1, action a12 = U to go to y=2\n\nt=13: y=2, action a13 = U to go to y=3\n\nt=14: y=3, action a14 = U to go to y=4\n\nt=15: y=4, action a15 = U to go to y=5\n\nt=16: y=5, action a16 = U to go to y=6\n\nt=17: y=6, action a17 = U to go to y=7\n\nt=18: y=7, action a18 = U to go to y=8\n\nt=19: y=8, action a19 = U to go to y=9\n\nAt t=20, y=9.\n\nNow, we reach y=9 at t=20, after 10 actions from t=10 to t=19.\n\nH=10.\n\nBut is there a way to save one turn?\n\nFor example, at some point, we can skip a step.\n\nBut from y=1 to y=9, must increase by 8, so 8 actions, plus the two down, 10 total.\n\nPerhaps after t=12, we can go directly, but no.\n\nAnother idea: at t=12, we are at y=1, which is safe until t=22, but we go up slowly.\n\nBut we could go up faster, but we are constrained by the speed.\n\nUnless we can be at higher y earlier, but from t=12 y=1, we can only reach y=2 at t=13, etc.\n\nPerhaps we can stay at some row to time the passage, but in this case, since no other constraints, going up as fast as possible is best.\n\nBut here, going up fast brings us to y=7 at t=18, which is fine.\n\nIf we go slower, we might be later.\n\nSo I think this is minimal.\n\nBut let's check the unsafe times for y=1: unsafe at t=22,23,24,25.\n\nIn this path, we leave y=1 at t=12, and at t=13 we are at y=2, so no problem.\n\nWe never back to low y.\n\nSo all good.\n\nNow, the answer should be the sequence of actions.\n\nCurrent turn t_1=10.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 10: D\n\nTurn 11: D\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nAnd we reach at turn 20.\n\nIn the sequence, up to turn 19.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be from t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nt_1=10, H=10, so actions at t=10 to t=19.\n\nNow, in the box.\n\nBut let's write the actions.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 10: a_{10} = D\n\nTurn 11: a_{11} = D\n\nTurn 12: a_{12} = U\n\n...\n\nUp to turn 19: a_{19} = U\n\nThen at turn 20, position y=9.\n\nNow, but in the freeway, for example, at t=18, y=7, which is freeway 7, and we need to ensure no collision.\n\nt=18, Δt=18-10=8\n\nFor y=7, cars: first car, left= -35 +6*8 = -35+48=13, right=-24+48=24, span [13,24], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSecond car, left=13+48=61, right=24+48=72, safe.\n\nSimilarly t=19, y=8: similar, Δt=9, left first car: -35 +54=19, right=-24+54=30; second car left=13+54=67, etc, all positive, safe.\n\nt=20, y=9, safe.\n\nNo issues.\n\nPerhaps we can have a shorter path by not going down to y=1, but I think not.\n\nAnother thought: at t=10, y=3, we could go up to y=4 or something, but then at t=12 we are stuck in unsafe row.\n\nUnless we can be at y=7 or 8 at t=12, but impossible from y=3 in two steps.\n\nSo no.\n\nThus, minimal H is 10.\n\nBut let's see if we can reach y=9 in fewer than 10 actions.\n\nFor example, if we go all up except for the down, but we have to go down twice, which adds two extra steps, so from min 6 up, we have 6 + 2 down = 8, but we go from y=3 to y=9, min 6 up, but we add 2 down, so we need 2 down and then 8 up? From y=3 to y=1, that's two down, then from y=1 to y=9, 8 up, total 10 actions.\n\nIf we could go directly with 6 up, but we cannot because of t=12.\n\nSo H=10 is minimal.\n\nThus, the sequence is as above.\n\nNow, for the answer.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 12, we go U, to y=2, but y=2 is safe at that time? At t=13, y=2.\n\nt=13, for y=2: Δt=3, left= -35 +12*3= -35+36=1, right=-24+36=12, both positive? 1 to 12, 0 not in, since 1>0, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, all other times, no car covers 0 except the unsafe times we listed.\n\nSo fine.\n\nNow, write the actions.\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} = D\n\nTurn t_1 +1: a_{t_1 +1} = D\n\nTurn t_1 +2: U\n\n...\n\nUp to Turn t_1 +9: U\n\nt_1=10, H=10, actions from t=10 to t=19, which is t_1 to t_1 +9.\n\nt_1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nIn the sequence, t from 0 to H-1, but in the action, it's for each turn.\n\nIn the answer format: Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 +1}\n\n...\n\nTurn t_1 + H -1: a_{t_1 + H -1}\n\nHere t_1=10, H=10, so up to Turn 10 + 9 =19.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 10: D\n\nTurn 11: D\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nIn the sequence, from turn 12 to 19, we have 8 U actions, which take us from y=1 to y=9.\n\nYes.\n\nTo write in the box.\n\nBut in the freeway, for example, at turn 17, y=6, which is freeway 6.\n\nAt t=17, Δt=7.\n\nFor y=6, cars: first car, τ=-35,h=-24,s=12, left=-35+12*7=-35+84=49, right=-24+84=60, both >0, safe.\n\nSecond car, τ=37,h=48,s=12, left=37+84=121, right=48+84=132, safe.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nAll good.\n\nSo I think this is correct.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 3)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 10\\) is 10. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by ensuring the player is not on an unsafe freeway at the times when cars cover position \\(x = 0\\).\n\n### Key Constraints:\n- At turn \\(t = 12\\), freeways \\(y = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\) are unsafe due to cars covering \\(x = 0\\). Thus, the player must not be on these rows at \\(t = 12\\).\n- At turns \\(t = 14\\) and \\(t = 15\\), freeways \\(y = 7\\) and \\(y = 8\\) are unsafe. Thus, the player must not be on these rows at these times.\n- Freeways \\(y = 0\\) and \\(y = 9\\) are always safe.\n\n### Strategy:\n1. **Avoid \\(t = 12\\) on unsafe rows (\\(y = 2-6\\))**: From \\(y = 3\\) at \\(t = 10\\), the only safe position at \\(t = 12\\) is \\(y = 1\\) (as \\(y = 0\\) is unreachable in two steps). Thus, move down twice to reach \\(y = 1\\) at \\(t = 12\\).\n2. **Reach \\(y = 9\\) efficiently**: After \\(t = 12\\), all rows \\(y = 2-6\\) are safe except at \\(t = 12\\) (which is avoided), and \\(y = 7-8\\) are unsafe only at \\(t = 14-15\\). Since the player is at low \\(y\\) at \\(t = 14-15\\) (specifically \\(y = 3\\) and \\(y = 4\\)), these unsafe times are avoided. Then, move up continuously to reach \\(y = 9\\).\n\n### Action Sequence:\n- **Turn 10 (\\(t_1\\))**: Action \\(D\\) (down) to move from \\(y = 3\\) to \\(y = 2\\). (Safe: \\(y = 3\\) at \\(t = 10\\) has no collision.)\n- **Turn 11 (\\(t_1 + 1\\))**: Action \\(D\\) (down) to move from \\(y = 2\\) to \\(y = 1\\). (Safe: \\(y = 2\\) at \\(t = 11\\) has no collision.)\n- **Turn 12 (\\(t_1 + 2\\))**: Action \\(U\\) (up) to move from \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 2\\). (Safe: \\(y = 1\\) at \\(t = 12\\) has no collision, and \\(y = 2\\) is unsafe only at \\(t = 12\\), but the move occurs after the collision check.)\n- **Turn 13 (\\(t_1 + 3\\))**: Action \\(U\\) (up) to move from \\(y = 2\\) to \\(y = 3\\). (Safe: \\(y = 2\\) at \\(t = 13\\) has no collision.)\n- **Turn 14 (\\(t_1 + 4\\))**: Action \\(U\\) (up) to move from \\(y = 3\\) to \\(y = 4\\). (Safe: \\(y = 3\\) at \\(t = 14\\) has no collision, and \\(y = 7-8\\) are unsafe but player is not on them.)\n- **Turn 15 (\\(t_1 + 5\\))**: Action \\(U\\) (up) to move from \\(y = 4\\) to \\(y = 5\\). (Safe: \\(y = 4\\) at \\(t = 15\\) has no collision, and \\(y = 7-8\\) are unsafe but player is not on them.)\n- **Turn 16 (\\(t_1 + 6\\))**: Action \\(U\\) (up) to move from \\(y = 5\\) to \\(y = 6\\). (Safe: \\(y = 5\\) at \\(t = 16\\) has no collision.)\n- **Turn 17 (\\(t_1 + 7\\))**: Action \\(U\\) (up) to move from \\(y = 6\\) to \\(y = 7\\). (Safe: \\(y = 6\\) at \\(t = 17\\) has no collision, and \\(y = 7\\) is unsafe only at \\(t = 14-15\\), which have passed.)\n- **Turn 18 (\\(t_1 + 8\\))**: Action \\(U\\) (up) to move from \\(y = 7\\) to \\(y = 8\\). (Safe: \\(y = 7\\) at \\(t = 18\\) has no collision, and \\(y = 8\\) is unsafe only at \\(t = 14-15\\), which have passed.)\n- **Turn 19 (\\(t_1 + 9\\))**: Action \\(U\\) (up) to move from \\(y = 8\\) to \\(y = 9\\). (Safe: \\(y = 8\\) at \\(t = 19\\) has no collision.)\n\nAfter the action at turn 19, the player reaches \\(y = 9\\) at turn 20. The total number of actions \\(H = 10\\) is minimal, as fewer actions would either cause a collision at \\(t = 12\\) or fail to reach \\(y = 9\\) in time.\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 10: D \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: D \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 14: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 15: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 16: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 17: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 18: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 19: U }",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to get the player from (0,2) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t_1 = 11, and the player is at y=2.\n\nThe actions are U (up, y increases by 1), D (down, y decreases by 1), or S (stay, y stays the same). y must stay between 0 and 9, inclusive.\n\nCollision happens only if at some turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there's a car such that 0 is in its span at that exact turn. The span changes over time based on the car's direction and speed.\n\nImportant note: when you move to a new y at turn T, you are not on that new y until the next turn. So at turn T, you are on y_T, and if you move, at turn T+1 you are on y_{T+1}. So for collision, at turn T, we only care about the freeway y_T at that turn.\n\nThe car spans are given at turn t_1=11. For future turns, I need to compute the span based on the direction and speed.\n\nLet me list all the cars at t_1=11:\n\nFor freeway 1: one car, head -33, tail -44, direction right, speed 3. Since direction is right, the span is [tail, head] = [-44, -33]? No, let's see the car update rule.\n\nIt says: for left-moving, span(t) = [h, τ] and for right-moving, span(t) = [τ, h]. In the table, it's given as (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s).\n\nIn the freeway 1 row: \"(-33, -44, right, 3)\"\n\nI think this might be a bit confusing. Let me parse the notation.\n\nIt says: \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nFor freeway 1: (-33, -44, right, 3)\n\nBut for right-moving cars, the span should be [τ, h] according to the update rule. But here head is -33 and tail is -44, so if tail is -44 and head is -33, since it's right-moving, the span should be from τ to h, which is from -44 to -33? But -44 is less than -33, so [ -44, -33 ] would be from left to right? Let's think coordinates.\n\nI am considering the x-axis. The player is at (0,y), so x=0 is the point we care about for collision.\n\nCars are on the freeway, moving left or right.\n\nFor a right-moving car, at time t, span is [τ, h] with τ < h, I assume? But in this case for freeway 1, h = -33, τ = -44, so τ = -44 < h = -33, so since it's right-moving, the span is [τ, h] = [-44, -33].\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, it would be [h, τ] with h > τ, I think.\n\nBut in the update, for right-moving: span(T) = [τ + s(T-t), h + s(T-t)]\n\nFor left-moving: [h - s(T-t), τ - s(T-t)]\n\nAnd collision if 0 is in the span at turn T for the freeway y_T.\n\nNow, at turn T, for a given freeway, if there is a car such that 0 is between the start and end of the span.\n\nAlso, multiple cars per freeway, like freeway 6,7,8 have two cars.\n\nFreeway 6 has two: (-12,-23,right,12) and (60,49,right,12)? (60,49,right,12) — head 60, tail 49? But tail should be less than head for right-moving? 49 < 60, so [49,60] for the second car.\n\nSimilarly, first car: head -12, tail -23, so τ = -23? No, the notation is (head h, tail τ), so for first car: h = -12, τ = -23, so since right, span is [τ, h] = [-23, -12].\n\nLet's clarify the notation.\n\nIn the car state table:\n\nIt says \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nFor freeway 1: (-33, -44, right, 3) so h = -33, τ = -44\n\nSince direction is right, the span at time t is [τ, h] = [-44, -33]\n\nThen at time T, span = [τ + s(T-t), h + s(T-t)] for right-moving.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, span at t is [h, τ] and at T, [h - s(T-t), τ - s(T-t)]\n\nIn this case, all cars here are right-moving, I think. Let's check.\n\nFreeway 1: right\n\nFreeway 2: right\n\nFreeway 3: right\n\nFreeway 4: right\n\nFreeway 5: right\n\nFreeway 6: both right\n\nFreeway 7: both right\n\nFreeway 8: both right\n\nAll cars are right-moving. So for all, span at t is [τ, h] with τ < h? But in freeway 1, τ=-44, h=-33, so τ < h, yes.\n\nIn freeway 6, first car: h=-12, τ=-23, so τ=-23 < h=-12, span [-23,-12]\n\nSecond car: h=60, τ=49? (60,49,right,12) so h=60, τ=49, τ=49 < h=60, span [49,60]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 7: first car (-18,-29,right,6) so h=-18, τ=-29, span [-29,-18]\n\nSecond car (30,19,right,6) h=30, τ=19, span [19,30]\n\nFreeway 8 same as 7? (-18,-29,right,6) and (30,19,right,6)\n\nNow, t_1 = 11 is the current turn.\n\nPlayer at y=2.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\ny from 0 to 9, freeways are y=1 to 8, so we need to cross freeways 2,3,4,5,6,7,8 to reach y=9.\n\ny=9 is not a freeway, it's the top, so no car there.\n\nCollision only on freeways y=1 to 8.\n\nSince we start at y=2 at turn t=11, and we need to reach y=9.\n\nEach action changes y by +1, -1, or 0, but since we want to go up, probably U or S, but S keeps us in place, which might be useful to avoid cars.\n\nThe minimal number of turns H should be at least the difference in y, which is 7, from 2 to 9, so at least 7 actions if we go up every time, but we might need to wait or something to avoid cars.\n\nH is the number of turns, so from turn t_1 to t_1 + H - 1, we have H actions, and after H actions, we are at y=9.\n\nLet t be the turn index starting from t_1.\n\nAt time t (relative to t_1, so t=0 is t_1), y_{t_1 + t} = position at that turn.\n\nSet τ = t - t_1, so at τ=0, y=2.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn τ=H-1, y should be 9? Let's see the sequence.\n\nThe sequence is actions from t=0 to H-1, meaning:\n\nAfter action at t=0, position at t=1? No.\n\nThe player update: at turn T, action a_T determines Δy_T, so y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy_T.\n\nThe sequence is given as actions {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nSo at time index T = t_1 + t, for t from 0 to H-1.\n\nThen y_{t_1} is given, initial.\n\nAfter action a_{t_1} at turn t_1, we get y_{t_1 +1} = y_{t_1} + Δy\n\nThen at turn t_1 +1, we are at y_{t_1 +1}, and so on.\n\nAfter H actions, the last action is at turn t_1 + H -1, and after that, at turn t_1 + H, we are at position y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nWe want y_{t_1 + H} = 9? No.\n\nThe position is at the turn, I think.\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\n\"reach (0,9)\" means that at some turn, the position is (0,9).\n\nBut the sequence is actions from t=0 to H-1, so after H actions, the position is y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nBecause y_{t_1} is initial, a_{t_1} applied to get y_{t_1 +1}, ..., a_{t_1 + H -1} applied to get y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nSo we want y_{t_1 + H} = 9.\n\nAnd H is the number of actions, so the number of turns from start to finish is H, with H actions.\n\nMinimal H.\n\nSince we start at y=2, end at y=9, the minimum possible H is 7, if we go up each time.\n\nBut we need to check if we can do that without colliding with cars on the freeways we pass through.\n\nWe might need to wait or go down sometimes, but that would increase H, so for minimal H, we should avoid unnecessary moves, so probably go up as fast as possible, but avoid collisions.\n\nFirst, let's list the freeways we need to be on: from y=2, we will be on y=2, then to y=3, etc., up to y=9.\n\nBut at each turn, we are on a specific y.\n\nStart at turn t_1=11, y=2.\n\nAfter action a_{11}, we go to y_{12} = y_{11} + Δy\n\nThen at turn 12, we are on y= y_{12}, and so on.\n\nFor collision, at each turn T >= t_1, when we are on y_T, which is between 1 and 8, we need that for that freeway, no car has 0 in its span at turn T.\n\nNow, for each freeway, and for each car, we can compute when 0 is in the span.\n\nSince all cars are right-moving, the span at turn T is [τ + s(T - t_1), h + s(T - t_1)] for each car, with t_1=11.\n\nt_1 is fixed at 11.\n\nSet t_rel = T - t_1, so relative turn from 0.\n\nAt relative time τ (τ = T - t_1), the position y_{t_1 + τ}.\n\nFor collision at relative time τ, if y_{t_1 + τ} is between 1 and 8, and for freeway k = y_{t_1 + τ}, there is a car with 0 in [τ + s*τ, h + s*τ]? Let's see.\n\nT = t_1 + τ, so T - t_1 = τ.\n\nFor a car on freeway k, at time T, span is [τ_car + s * (T - t_1), h_car + s * (T - t_1)] = [τ + s τ, h + s τ] where τ and h are at t_1.\n\nFor a given car, at t_1, we have τ_t1 and h_t1.\n\nThen at time T, span = [τ_t1 + s*(T - t_1), h_t1 + s*(T - t_1)]\n\nCollision if 0 is in [start, end] for some car on that freeway at that time.\n\n0 in [A, B] means A <= 0 <= B.\n\nSince the car is moving right, the span is increasing.\n\nFor each freeway, we can find the times when there is a car covering x=0.\n\nThen, for each possible path, we need that at each turn, when we are on a freeway y, it is not a collision time for that freeway.\n\nNow, we start at τ=0, y=2.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at some τ, with minimal H such that after H actions, y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nSince each U increases y by 1, from 2 to 9, we need exactly 7 U actions to increase by 7, but we might have S or D, which would require more U to compensate, so to minimize H, we should avoid S or D, because they don't progress, or D regresses.\n\nIf we use S, we stay, so H increases but y doesn't change, so to go from 2 to 9, we need at least 7 U, and any S or D will require more actions, so H >7.\n\nSimilarly, D decreases y, so we need extra U to compensate, so H increases.\n\nTherefore, for minimal H, we should use only U actions, no S or D, so H=7, and we go from y=2 to y=3,4,5,6,7,8,9 in 7 steps.\n\nBut we need to check if we can do this without collision.\n\nThat is, at turns τ=0,1,2,3,4,5,6, we are on y=2,3,4,5,6,7,8 respectively? Let's see the timeline.\n\nAt relative τ=0, turn t_1 +0 =11, position y=2.\n\nAfter action a_{11} (which is U for up), at τ=1, turn 12, position y=3.\n\nSimilarly, action a_{12} at turn 12, to position at turn 13, y=4.\n\n...\n\nAfter action a_{11+6} at turn 17, position at turn 18, y=9.\n\nSequence:\n\nτ (relative) | turn absolute | action at this turn | position after action, i.e., at next turn\n\nBetter to list the position at each turn.\n\nAt turn T: position y_T.\n\nT = t_1 + τ for τ=0,1,2,...\n\nAt T=11, y=2\n\nAction a_T determines y_{T+1}\n\nWe want y_{11+H} =9, with H actions from T=11 to T=11+H-1.\n\nSo after H actions, at turn T=11+H, y=9.\n\nFor minimal H, let's assume H=7, so we go from y=2 to y=9 in 7 steps: positions at T=11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18.\n\nT=11: y=2\n\nT=12: y=3\n\nT=13: y=4\n\nT=14: y=5\n\nT=15: y=6\n\nT=16: y=7\n\nT=17: y=8\n\nT=18: y=9\n\nAt each turn T from 11 to 17, we are on a freeway y_T from 2 to 8, and we need no collision at that turn.\n\nAt T=18, y=9, not a freeway, so no collision possible.\n\nNow, for each T and each freeway y, check if there is a car collision at x=0.\n\nSince the freeway has cars only if y between 1 and 8.\n\nNow, for each freeway, compute when 0 is in the span of any car.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: only one car: at t_1=11, τ=-44, h=-33, s=3, right.\n\nSpan at time T: [ -44 + 3(T-11), -33 + 3(T-11) ]\n\nSet Δt = T - 11, so at relative time τ = Δt.\n\nSpan: [ -44 + 3τ, -33 + 3τ ]\n\n0 in span if -44 + 3τ <= 0 <= -33 + 3τ\n\nSo -44 + 3τ <= 0 and 0 <= -33 + 3τ\n\nFirst inequality: -44 + 3τ <= 0 => 3τ <= 44 => τ <= 44/3 ≈ 14.666, so τ <= 14 since τ integer\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= -33 + 3τ => 33 <= 3τ => τ >= 11\n\nSo for τ from 11 to 14 inclusive, 0 in span? Let's check:\n\nAt τ=11: -44 + 33 = -11, -33 + 33=0, so [ -11, 0], 0 is included, yes.\n\nAt τ=12: -44+36= -8, -33+36=3, [ -8,3], 0 in.\n\nAt τ=13: -44+39= -5, -33+39=6, [-5,6], 0 in.\n\nAt τ=14: -44+42= -2, -33+42=9, [-2,9], 0 in.\n\nAt τ=15: -44+45=1, -33+45=12, [1,12], 0 not >=1, so not in.\n\nSimilarly, τ=10: -44+30= -14, -33+30= -3, [-14,-3], 0 not <= -3? 0 > -3, not in.\n\nSo for freeway 1, collision when τ between 11 and 14 inclusive.\n\nτ relative to t_1=11, so absolute T from 22 to 25? T = t_1 + τ =11 + τ.\n\nSo at T=22,23,24,25: τ=11,12,13,14.\n\nBut we are considering turns from T=11 onwards, which is τ=0 to, say, for H=7, up to T=17 or 18.\n\nT=11 is τ=0.\n\nAt τ=0, T=11, freeway 1: span [-44 +0, -33+0] = [-44,-33], 0 not in, so no collision at T=11 for freeway 1.\n\nBut we care about freeway y at that turn.\n\nFor freeway 1, collision times: τ=11,12,13,14, i.e., T=22,23,24,25.\n\nIn our path for H=7, we are only at T=11 to 17, all before 22, so for freeway 1, at T=11 to 17, τ=0 to 6, span: τ=0: [-44,-33], not contain 0; τ=1: [-41,-30], no; ... up to τ=6: -44+18= -26, -33+18= -15, [-26,-15], no 0. So freeway 1 is safe for T=11 to 17.\n\nBut we are on freeway 1 only if y=1 at that turn. In our path, at T=11, y=2, not 1; we never on y=1, so freeway 1 irrelevant for us.\n\nSimilarly, we start from y=2, go to y=3,4,5,6,7,8, so freeways 2,3,4,5,6,7,8 are relevant.\n\nFreeway 1 is y=1, we don't go there.\n\nNow freeway 2: cars: only one car (-12,-23,right,12) so h=-12, τ=-23, s=12, right.\n\nAt t_1=11, span [τ, h] = [-23, -12]\n\nAt T, span [ -23 + 12(T-11), -12 + 12(T-11) ]\n\nSet τ = T-11, span [ -23 + 12τ, -12 + 12τ ]\n\n0 in span if -23 +12τ <= 0 <= -12 +12τ\n\nFirst: -23 +12τ <=0 => 12τ <=23 => τ <= 23/12 ≈1.916, so τ <=1\n\nSecond: 0 <= -12 +12τ => 12τ >=12 => τ >=1\n\nSo τ=1\n\nAt τ=1, -23+12= -11, -12+12=0, [ -11, 0], 0 included.\n\nAt other times, no.\n\nSo collision at τ=1, T=12.\n\nNow, in our path, at T=12, we are on y=3? Positions:\n\nT=11: y=2\n\nT=12: y=3\n\nT=13: y=4\n\netc.\n\nAt T=12, we are on freeway y=3, not y=2. Freeway 2 is for y=2.\n\nAt T=12, position y=3, so we are on freeway 3, not 2.\n\nSimilarly, at T=11, y=2, on freeway 2.\n\nAt T=11, τ=0, freeway 2: span [-23 +0, -12+0] = [-23,-12], 0 not in, so no collision at T=11 for freeway 2.\n\nAt T=12, we are on y=3, freeway 3.\n\nBut for freeway 2, collision at T=12, but we are not on freeway 2 at T=12, so no problem.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: cars: same as freeway 2? Freeway 3 has (-12,-23,right,12), identical to freeway 2.\n\nCars for freeway 3: (-12,-23,right,12), same as freeway 2.\n\nSo for freeway 3, span at τ: [ -23 +12τ, -12 +12τ ]\n\n0 in when τ=1, same as above.\n\nCollision at T=12.\n\nAt T=12, in our path, we are on y=3, which is freeway 3, so at T=12, on freeway 3, and collision occurs at T=12 for freeway 3.\n\nExactly.\n\nAt T=12, y=3, freeway 3 has a car with 0 in span: at τ=1, [ -23+12, -12+12] = [-11,0], yes 0 included.\n\nSo if we are on y=3 at T=12, we collide.\n\nBut in our direct path, we are on y=3 at T=12, so collision.\n\nTherefore, we cannot go directly up at that time.\n\nFor H=7 with all U, we have collision at T=12.\n\nSo we need to avoid that.\n\nPerhaps wait or something.\n\nBut with H=7, we have to go up each time, no choice, so impossible with H=7.\n\nThus minimal H might be more.\n\nWe need to delay or change the time we are on certain freeways.\n\nFor example, at freeway 3, collision at T=12 only.\n\nLet's list for each freeway the collision times.\n\nFirst, freeway 2: one car (-12,-23,right,12)\n\nCollision at τ=1, T=12 only.\n\nFreeway 3: same, one car (-12,-23,right,12), collision at τ=1, T=12 only.\n\nFreeway 4: same, (-12,-23,right,12), collision at T=12.\n\nFreeway 5: same, (-12,-23,right,12), collision at T=12.\n\nNow freeway 6: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (-12,-23,right,12), same as above.\n\nSecond car: (60,49,right,12), so h=60, τ=49, s=12.\n\nSpan at τ: [49 +12τ, 60 +12τ]\n\n0 in span? 49+12τ <=0 <=60+12τ? But 49+12τ >=49>0 for τ>=0, so 0 <= 49+12τ is false since left is 0, right at least 49, so 0 < 49+12τ always, but the inequality is start <=0<= end.\n\nHere start =49+12τ >=49>0, so 0 < start, so 0 not >= start, so not in span. Similarly for all τ, since min start is 49 at τ=0.\n\nSo second car never covers x=0.\n\nThus for freeway 6, only the first car matters, collision at T=12, same as others.\n\nFreeway 7: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (-18,-29,right,6), so h=-18, τ=-29, s=6\n\nSpan at τ: [ -29 +6τ, -18 +6τ ]\n\n0 in if -29 +6τ <=0 <= -18 +6τ\n\nFirst: -29+6τ <=0 => 6τ <=29 => τ <= 29/6 ≈4.833, τ<=4\n\nSecond: 0 <= -18+6τ => 6τ >=18 => τ >=3\n\nSo τ=3 or 4? τ integer.\n\nτ=3: -29+18= -11, -18+18=0, [ -11, 0], 0 in.\n\nτ=4: -29+24= -5, -18+24=6, [ -5,6], 0 in.\n\nτ=2: -29+12= -17, -18+12= -6, [ -17,-6], 0 not in.\n\nτ=5: -29+30=1, -18+30=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo collision at τ=3 and 4, T=14 and 15.\n\nSecond car on freeway 7: (30,19,right,6), h=30, τ=19, s=6\n\nSpan [19+6τ, 30+6τ]\n\n0 in? 19+6τ <=0 <=30+6τ? Left 19+6τ >=19>0, so 0 < start, not in span. Never.\n\nSo freeway 7 collision at T=14 and 15.\n\nFreeway 8: similar to 7, two cars (-18,-29,right,6) and (30,19,right,6)\n\nFirst car same as freeway 7 first car, collision at T=14,15.\n\nSecond car never.\n\nSo freeway 8 collision at T=14,15.\n\nNow, freeway 1 we don't care.\n\nIn our direct path:\n\nT=11: y=2, freeway 2, no collision at T=11 (since collision only at T=12)\n\nT=12: y=3, freeway 3, collision at T=12, problem.\n\nT=13: y=4, freeway 4, collision? Freeway 4 collision at T=12 only? At T=13, τ=2, freeway 4 car: [ -23 +12*2, -12+12*2] = [-23+24, -12+24] = [1,12], 1>0, 0 not <=1? 0 <1, not in [1,12], so no collision at T=13 for freeway 4.\n\nSimilarly, T=14: y=5, freeway 5, at τ=3, [ -23+36, -12+36] = [13,24], 0 not in.\n\nT=15: y=6, freeway 6, at τ=4, first car [ -23+48, -12+48] = [25,36], no; second car [49+48,60+48]=[97,108], no.\n\nT=16: y=7, freeway 7, at τ=5, freeway 7 collision at τ=3,4 only, τ=5: first car [ -29+30, -18+30] = [1,12], 0 not in; second car [19+30,30+30]=[49,60], no.\n\nBut freeway 7 collision at T=14,15, which is τ=3,4.\n\nT=16 is τ=5, no collision.\n\nT=17: y=8, freeway 8, τ=6, freeway 8 collision at τ=3,4, τ=6: first car [ -29+36, -18+36]=[7,18], no; second car [19+36,30+36]=[55,66], no.\n\nSo only problem at T=12, y=3.\n\nTo avoid, we need to not be on y=3 at T=12.\n\nSince we start at T=11, y=2.\n\nIf at T=11, instead of going up, we stay or go down.\n\nBut if we go down, to y=1, but y=1 is freeway, and we might collide or not, but also it delays progress.\n\nSimilarly, stay at y=2.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9.\n\nMinimal H, so we should minimize extra actions.\n\nSince only T=12 is problematic for y=3, we can be on y=3 at a different time.\n\nFor example, at T=11, instead of U, we do S, so stay at y=2.\n\nThen at T=12, y=2 still.\n\nThen we can go U to y=3 at T=13? Action at T=12 to go to y=3 at T=13.\n\nTimeline:\n\nT=11: y=2, action S, so y_{12} = y_{11} +0 =2\n\nThen at T=12: position y=2, action U, so y_{13} =2+1=3\n\nThen action at T=13: U, y_{14}=4, and so on.\n\nNow, check collisions.\n\nT=11: y=2, freeway 2, τ=0, span [-23,-12], 0 not in, ok.\n\nT=12: y=2, freeway 2, τ=1, but freeway 2 collision at τ=1, T=12.\n\nAt T=12, y=2, freeway 2, and collision at T=12 for freeway 2.\n\nBecause at τ=1, [ -23+12, -12+12] = [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nSo if we are on y=2 at T=12, we collide.\n\nProblem.\n\nAt T=11, if we go down to y=1.\n\nAction D at T=11, so y_{12} = y_{11} -1 =2-1=1\n\nThen at T=12: y=1, which is freeway 1.\n\nFreeway 1: at τ=1, T=12, span [ -44 +3(1), -33 +3(1) ] = [-41,-30], 0 not in, so ok.\n\nThen at T=12, we can go U to y=2 at T=13?

But freeway 7 collision at τ=3,4 only, so ok.\n\nT=19: y=8? Action at T=17 U, y_{18}=7\n\nT=18: y=7, action U, y_{19}=8\n\nT=19: y=8, freeway 8, τ=8, first car [ -29 +48, -18+48] = [19,30], no; second car [19+48,30+48]=[67,78], no. Collision only at τ=3,4.\n\nT=20: y=9? Action at T=18 U, y_{19}=8\n\nT=19: y=8, action U, y_{20}=9\n\nThen at T=20, y=9, done.\n\nBut we started at T=11, y=2, ended at T=20, y=9, so H actions from T=11 to T=19? Let's see.\n\nActions: from t=0 to H-1 relative, but absolute.\n\nActions at turns: T=11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19: that's 9 actions.\n\nPositions: after actions.\n\nAt T=11: action D, to y_{12}=1\n\nT=12: action U, to y_{13}=2\n\nT=13: action U, to y_{14}=3\n\nT=14: action U, to y_{15}=4\n\nT=15: action U, to y_{16}=5\n\nT=16: action U, to y_{17}=6\n\nT=17: action U, to y_{18}=7\n\nT=18: action U, to y_{19}=8\n\nT=19: action U, to y_{20}=9\n\nSo y_{20}=9, with actions from T=11 to T=19, 9 actions, H=9.\n\nBut earlier we had a collision at T=12 if we go directly, now we avoided by going down to y=1 first.\n\nBut H=9, which is larger than 7.\n\nCan we do with less?\n\nFor example, instead of going down, stay at some point.\n\nBut at T=11, if we stay S, then at T=12, y=2, but at T=12, freeway 2 has collision, as we saw.\n\nIf we go up at T=11 to y=3 at T=12, collision.\n\nSo we must not be on y=2 or y=3 at T=12? At T=12, freeway 2 and freeway 3 both have collision? Freeway 2 collision at T=12, freeway 3 also at T=12.\n\nBut y=1 at T=12 is safe, as we used.\n\nPerhaps we can be on y=4 or something, but we start from y=2, we can only change by 1 per turn.\n\nAt T=11, from y=2, we can only go to y=1,2,3 at T=12.\n\ny=1: safe at T=12\n\ny=2: collision\n\ny=3: collision\n\nSo only y=1 is safe at T=12.\n\nThus, we must go to y=1 at T=12 to avoid collision.\n\nThen from there, we need to go up.\n\nBut after that, we can go directly up, but we have extra steps.\n\nIn the path above, we used one D and then U all the way, but from y=1 to y=9, we need 8 U, but we started at y=2, went to y=1, then to y=2,3,...,9.\n\nFrom T=12 y=1 to T=20 y=9, that's 8 steps up, but we have action at T=11 D to go down, then from T=12 to T=19 actions to go up.\n\nTotal actions: T=11 to T=19, 9 actions.\n\nBut we can minimize by not going all the way.\n\nNotice that after T=12, the collision times are only at specific points.\n\nFor example, freeway 7 and 8 have collisions at T=14 and 15.\n\nIn our current path, when do we hit those?\n\nIn the path above: at T=14: y=3? Let's see:\n\nAfter T=12: y=1\n\nT=13: y=2 (after U at T=12)\n\nT=14: y=3 (after U at T=13)\n\nT=15: y=4 (U at T=14)\n\nT=16: y=5\n\nT=17: y=6\n\nT=18: y=7\n\nT=19: y=8\n\nT=20: y=9\n\nAt T=14: y=3, freeway 3, τ=3, [13,24] no collision.\n\nT=15: y=4, freeway 4, τ=4, [25,36] no.\n\nBut freeway 7 collision at T=14 and 15, but we are on y=3 and 4 at those times, not y=7.\n\nWhen we reach y=7, at T=18, τ=7, no collision.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nBut H=9.\n\nCan we reach faster?\n\nFor example, after avoiding T=12, we can go up faster or skip some waiting.\n\nBut since we had to go down to y=1, we lost one step.\n\nPerhaps we can stay at y=2 longer, but at T=12, we cannot be at y=2 or y=3.\n\nAt T=11, if we do nothing, S, then at T=12 y=2, collision.\n\nIf we go U, to y=3, collision.\n\nSo only D to y=1 is safe at T=12.\n\nThen from there, we need to go up.\n\nBut to save time, perhaps after going to y=1, we can go directly to higher y, but we can only change by 1 per turn.\n\nAnother idea: go down at T=11 to y=1, then at T=12, since y=1 is safe, we can go up to y=2 at T=13? No, action at T=12 determines y_{13}.\n\nAt T=12, from y=1, we can go to y=0,1,2.\n\ny=0 is not a freeway, so no collision possible, since collision only on y=1 to 8.\n\ny=0 is safe, no cars.\n\nSimilarly, y=9 safe.\n\nIn this case, at T=12, y=1, we can go to y=0, but that might be worse.\n\nOr stay, or up.\n\nIf we go up to y=2 at T=13.\n\nBut at T=13, we can be on y=2, which is freeway 2, τ=2, [1,12] no collision, as before.\n\nThen continue.\n\nBut still, from y=1 to y=9, 8 steps, plus the initial D, 9 actions.\n\nPerhaps we can be at y=3 at a different time.\n\nFor example, if we can delay being at y=3 until after T=12.\n\nSince collision at T=12 only for y=3.\n\nIn the direct path, we are at y=3 at T=12.\n\nIf we start by staying at y=2 for one turn.\n\nBut at T=11, if S, then at T=12 y=2, but collision at T=12 for y=2.\n\nCannot.\n\nGo down to y=1 at T=12, then at T=12, from y=1, if we go up immediately to y=2 at T=13, then to y=3 at T=14.\n\nAt T=14, y=3, freeway 3, τ=3, [13,24] no collision, good.\n\nThen from there, we can go up to y=4,5,6,7,8,9.\n\nBut we need to check freeway 7 and 8 collisions at T=14,15.\n\nIn this path:\n\nT=11: action D, to y_{12}=1\n\nT=12: action U, to y_{13}=2\n\nT=13: action U, to y_{14}=3\n\nT=14: action U, to y_{15}=4\n\nT=15: action U, to y_{16}=5\n\nT=16: action U, to y_{17}=6\n\nT=17: action U, to y_{18}=7\n\nT=18: action U, to y_{19}=8\n\nT=19: action U, to y_{20}=9\n\nSame as before, H=9 actions.\n\nAt T=14, y=3, which is fine, no collision.\n\nBut at T=14, freeway 7 has collision, but we are on y=3, not 7.\n\nSimilarly T=15, y=4, not 7.\n\nNow, when we reach y=7, at T=18, τ=7, no collision.\n\nSo same.\n\nBut can we save a turn?\n\nFor example, after going to y=1, at T=12, instead of going up, we go to y=0 or something, but that might not help.\n\nPerhaps we don't need to go down; maybe we can go up later.\n\nBut at T=11, we must take an action that avoids being on y=2 or y=3 at T=12.\n\nOnly by going to y=1.\n\nUnless we can be on a different y at T=12.\n\nBut from y=2, only y=1,2,3 possible at T=12.\n\ny=2 and y=3 both collide at T=12, y=1 safe.\n\nSo no choice.\n\nThus, minimal H must be at least 8? From y=2 to y=9, min 7 actions, but we need one extra action to go down, so 8 actions might be possible?\n\nWith 8 actions: we start at y=2, end at y_{11+8}=y_{19}=9.\n\nAfter 8 actions, y_{19}=9.\n\nInitial y_{11}=2.\n\nSo we need to increase y by 7 in 8 actions, so we must have 7 U and 1 other action, either S or D.\n\nIf S, we stay once, y increases by 7 in 8 steps.\n\nIf D, we decrease once, so we need 8 U to increase by 8, but since we decreased, net +7, but let's see.\n\nIf we use one D, we go down once, then to compensate, we need two extra U, so 7 U + D + U, but net from 2, down to 1, then up to 9, which is 8 up from 1, but we start at 2, so 9 actions as before.\n\nWith 8 actions: let the number of U be u, D be d, S be s, u + d + s =8, and y change: u - d =7, since from 2 to 9, delta +7.\n\nAlso, y must stay in [0,9].\n\nSo u - d =7, u + d + s =8.\n\nThen from u - d =7, u + d + s =8, add them: 2u + s =15, subtract: 2d + s =1.\n\nSince u,d,s >=0 integers.\n\n2d + s =1, so possible d=0, s=1; or d=1, s=-1 impossible; so d=0, s=1, then u=7.\n\nSo only possibility: 7 U and 1 S, no D.\n\nWe must have exactly 7 U and 1 S, in some order.\n\nNow, we need to place the S such that we avoid the collision at T=12 for y=3.\n\nIn the direct path, collision at T=12 when y=3.\n\nNow, with one S, we can stay at some point to shift the times.\n\nFor example, if we stay at y=2 at some turn.\n\nStart at T=11, y=2.\n\nIf we do S at T=11, then y_{12}=2, but at T=12, y=2, freeway 2, collision at T=12, as before.\n\nNot good.\n\nIf we do U at T=11, to y_{12}=3, but at T=12, y=3, collision.\n\nAlso bad.\n\nNow, suppose we do U at T=11 to y_{12}=3, but collide.\n\nPerhaps do U later.\n\nSequence with one S.\n\nFor example, at T=11, do U to y_{12}=3, but collision at T=12.\n\nNot avoidable.\n\nAt T=11, do S, y_{12}=2, collision at T=12.\n\nStill.\n\nThen, perhaps do U at T=11 to y_{12}=3, collide, or not.\n\nOnly other possibility: at some point, do S when we are not at risk.\n\nBut at the beginning, we have to pass through y=2 and y=3.\n\nLet's list the positions over time.\n\nDenote the action at each turn.\n\nWe need y_{19}=9.\n\ny_{11}=2.\n\nSo positions: y_{11}, y_{12}, ..., y_{19}=9.\n\nEach step, y changes by -1,0,+1.\n\nAnd y_{t} for t=11 to 18 must not have collision when on freeway.\n\nSince y_{19}=9, not freeway.\n\nNow, with u=7, s=1, d=0, so one stay, seven up.\n\nThe stay must be at some turn.\n\nSuppose we do the stay at T=11: action S, so y_{12}=2\n\nThen at T=12, y=2, but collision, since freeway 2 at T=12 has car covering 0.\n\nNot good.\n\nDo action U at T=11, y_{12}=3, but at T=12, y=3, freeway 3 collision.\n\nNot good.\n\nDo action at later turn.\n\nFor example, at T=12, do S or something.\n\nBut at T=12, we are already at y_{12}, which depends on previous.\n\nStart: T=11, y=2.\n\nAction at T=11: suppose we do U, so y_{12}=3, but then at T=12, y=3, collision. Invalid.\n\nIf we do S at T=11, y_{12}=2, at T=12, y=2, collision. Invalid.\n\nIf we do D at T=11, y_{12}=1, then at T=12, y=1, freeway 1, τ=1, span [-44+3,-33+3]=[-41,-30], 0 not in, safe.\n\nThen action at T=12: we can do U, to y_{13}=2; or S to y_{13}=1; or D to y_{13}=0.\n\nNow, if we do U, y_{13}=2, then at T=13, y=2, freeway 2, τ=2, span [-23+24,-12+24]=[1,12], 0 not in, safe.\n\nThen we need to go to y=9 at T=19.\n\nFrom y_{13}=2, to y_{19}=9, need to increase by 7 in 6 actions? T=13 to T=19 is 6 turns: actions at T=13 to T=18, positions y_{14} to y_{19}.\n\ny_{13}=2, y_{19}=9, so in 6 actions, we need to increase by 7, which requires at least 7 up, but only 6 actions, impossible.\n\ny_{13} to y_{19}: actions at T=13,14,15,16,17,18 determine y_{14} to y_{19}.\n\ny_{14} to y_{19} must go from some value to 9.\n\ny_{13} is fixed at 2 after action at T=12.\n\nAfter action at T=12, we have y_{13}.\n\nThen actions at T=13 to T=18 for 6 actions, to reach y_{19}=9.\n\ny_{13} to y_{19}, delta y = +6? y_{19} = y_{13} + sum of Δy from t=13 to 18.\n\nEach Δy from action at t.\n\ny_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\n\nSo y_{19} = y_{13} + Δy_{13} + Δy_{14} + ... + Δy_{18}\n\nNow, y_{19} =9, y_{13} = ? Suppose y_{13}=2, then 9 = 2 + sum_{t=13}^{18} Δy_t\n\nsum from t=13 to 18 of Δy_t must be 7.\n\nBut there are only 6 actions (t=13 to 18), each Δy <=1, so sum <=6, cannot be 7. Impossible.\n\nIf y_{13}=1, then 9=1 + sum, sum=8, with 6 actions, impossible.\n\nIf at T=12, we do S, y_{13}=1, then y_{13}=1, then to y_{19}=9, need sum Δy =8 in 6 actions, max sum 6, impossible.\n\nIf at T=12 we do D, y_{13}=0, then 9=0 + sum, sum=9 in 6 actions, impossible.\n\nTherefore, with H=8 actions, from T=11 to T=18, we have y_{19} determined by actions up to T=18.\n\ny_{19} = y_{11} + sum_{t=11}^{18} Δy_t = 2 + sum of 8 Δy.\n\ny_{19} =9, so 2 + sum =9, sum=7.\n\nWith 8 Δy, each -1,0,1, sum=7, so we need exactly 7 U and 1 S, as before.\n\nNow, the positions y_t for t=12 to 18 must be safe (t=11 is start, no action before, but position at t=11 is given, and we are on y=2 at T=11, which is safe).\n\nAt T=11, y=2, freeway 2, τ=0, no collision, as earlier.\n\nNow, y_{12} depends on action at T=11.\n\nIf action at T=11 is U, y_{12}=3\n\nThen at T=12, y=3, must be safe, but collision, not safe.\n\nIf action at T=11 is S, y_{12}=2, at T=12, y=2, collision, not safe.\n\nIf action at T=11 is D, y_{12}=1, at T=12, y=1, safe, as before.\n\nBut then with 8 actions, we have only one S, but if we do D at T=11, that is a down, not stay or up, so in the actions, we have one D, but we need only U and S, no D for H=8 with sum=7.\n\nIn this case, if we do D at T=11, Δy = -1, then we need more up.\n\nBut with H=8 actions, if we have one D, then to have net +7, we need 8 U and one D, but 8+1=9 actions, too many.\n\nSpecifically: actions: let num U, D, S.\n\nu + d + s =8\n\nu - d =7\n\nThen u - d =7, u + d + s =8, add: 2u + s =15, subtract: 2d + s =1.\n\nSince s >=0, 2d + s =1, so d=0, s=1, u=7; or d=1, s=-1 impossible; so only possibility d=0, s=1, u=7.\n\nCannot have D; must have exactly one S and seven U.\n\nTherefore, we cannot use D; only S and U.\n\nBut with that, at the beginning, we cannot avoid the collision at T=12 without going down, which we cannot do with only S and U.\n\nSpecifically, at T=11, actions:\n\n- U: y_{12}=3, collide at T=12\n\n- S: y_{12}=2, collide at T=12\n\n- D: but D not allowed, since we must have only U and S.\n\nSo no valid action at T=11 that avoids collision at T=12 with only S or U.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible with H=8.\n\nThus minimal H is 9, with one D and eight U.\n\nIn the path we have earlier: actions D at T=11, then U at T=12 to T=19.\n\nT=11: D\n\nT=12: U\n\nT=13: U\n\n...\n\nT=19: U\n\nBut T=19 is the last action? H actions from t=0 to H-1.\n\nRelative: τ from 0 to H-1.\n\nAbsolute turns: t_1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nt_1=11.\n\nSo actions at T=11,12,13,...,11+H-1.\n\nAfter that, position at T=11+H.\n\nSet to 9.\n\nIn our case, with H=9, actions at T=11 to 19? T=11 + t for t=0 to 8, since t=0 to H-1, H=9, t=0 to 8, T=11 to 19.\n\nThen position at T=20, y=9.\n\nActions: a_{11} = D, a_{12} = U, a_{13}=U, a_{14}=U, a_{15}=U, a_{16}=U, a_{17}=U, a_{18}=U, a_{19}=U\n\nNow, positions:\n\nT=11: y=2 (start)\n\nAfter a_{11}=D, y_{12}=1\n\nT=12: y=1, after a_{12}=U, y_{13}=2\n\nT=13: y=2, after a_{13}=U, y_{14}=3\n\nT=14: y=3, after a_{14}=U, y_{15}=4\n\nT=15: y=4, after a_{15}=U, y_{16}=5\n\nT=16: y=5, after a_{16}=U, y_{17}=6\n\nT=17: y=6, after a_{17}=U, y_{18}=7\n\nT=18: y=7, after a_{18}=U, y_{19}=8\n\nT=19: y=8, after a_{19}=U, y_{20}=9\n\nNow, check collisions at each T from 11 to 19.\n\nT=11: y=2, freeway 2, τ=0, span [-23,-12], 0 not in, ok.\n\nT=12: y=1, freeway 1, τ=1, span [-44+3, -33+3]=[-41,-30], 0 not in, ok.\n\nT=13: y=2, freeway 2, τ=2, span [-23+24, -12+24]=[1,12], 0 not in, ok.\n\nT=14: y=3, freeway 3, τ=3, span [-23+36, -12+36]=[13,24], 0 not in, ok.\n\nT=15: y=4, freeway 4, τ=4, span [-23+48, -12+48]=[25,36], no, ok.\n\nT=16: y=5, freeway 5, τ=5, span [-23+60, -12+60]=[37,48], no, ok.\n\nT=17: y=6, freeway 6, τ=6, first car [-23+72,-12+72]=[49,60], no; second car [49+72,60+72]=[121,132]? τ=6, s=12, [49+12*6,60+12*6]=[49+72,60+72]=[121,132], no 0, ok.\n\nT=18: y=7, freeway 7, τ=7, first car [-29+42, -18+42]=[13,24]? s=6, τ=7, [ -29 +6*7, -18+42]=[-29+42, -18+42]=[13,24], 0 not in; second car [19+42,30+42]=[61,72], no.

We saw it impossible because we must use D to avoid, but with H=8, we cannot have D.\n\nPerhaps with different timing.\n\nFor example, if we can be on y=3 at T=13 or later, but to do that from start, we need to delay.\n\nBut at T=11, if we do S, we are stuck at y=2 at T=12 with collision.\n\nNo other choice.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 9.\n\nNow, for the sequence.\n\nIn the sequence above, we have actions from T=11 to T=19.\n\nBut in the answer, it should be for turns starting from t_1.\n\nt_1=11.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 11: D\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nBut after action at turn 19, position at turn 20 is y=9.\n\nAnd H=9.\n\nWe need to reach (0,9), which we do at turn 20.\n\nIn the sequence, the last action is at turn 19, which is t_1 + 8? t_1=11, H=9, actions from t=0 to 8 relative, absolute 11 to 19.\n\nYes.\n\nPerhaps we can have the stay action later, but we cannot with H=8.\n\nAnother idea: since freeway 7 and 8 have collisions at T=14 and 15, but in our path, we are not on them at that time, so no issue.\n\nBut we don't need to worry about them since we pass later.\n\nSo the sequence is as above.\n\nIn the sequence, from turn 13 to 19, we have U all, but we have one D at the beginning.\n\nTo write the answer.\n\nBut in the sequence, after the first D, all U.\n\nBut we need to specify for each turn.\n\nNow, the answer format.\n\nAlso, we need to confirm if we can reach faster by not going down immediately, but I think not.\n\nSuppose at T=11, we go up to y=3, but collide at T=12, unavoidable.\n\nOr, perhaps go to y=3 later, but from y=2, we have to go through y=3 at some point, but the collision is only at T=12, so if we are on y=3 at other times, it might be safe.\n\nFor example, if we can be on y=3 at T=13 or T=14.\n\nBut to be on y=3 at T=13, we need to be at y=2 or 3 or 4 at T=12.\n\nBut at T=12, if we are at y=2, collision; y=3 collision; y=4 might be safe, but from T=11 y=2, we can only be at y=1,2,3 at T=12.\n\nCannot reach y=4 at T=12.\n\nSimilarly, to be at y=3 at T=14, we need to be at y=2,3,4 at T=13.\n\nBut at T=13, y=2 is safe, as we saw.\n\nFor example: start at T=11, y=2.\n\nAction at T=11: let's say we do D to y_{12}=1 (to avoid T=12 collision)\n\nThen at T=12, y=1, action U to y_{13}=2\n\nThen at T=13, y=2, action U to y_{14}=3\n\nThen we are at y=3 at T=14? Position at T=14 is y=3.\n\nT=14, y=3.\n\nτ=3, freeway 3, span [13,24] no collision, good.\n\nThen we can go up to y=4 at T=15, etc.\n\nBut to reach y=9 at T=19, we need y_{19}=9.\n\nFrom y_{14}=3, to y_{19}=9, need +6 in 5 actions? Actions from T=14 to T=18 determine y_{15} to y_{19}.\n\ny_{15} to y_{19} must go to 9.\n\ny_{14}=3, y_{19}=9, so y_{19} = y_{14} + Δy_{14} + ... + Δy_{18}\n\n9 = 3 + sum_{t=14}^{18} Δy_t, so sum =6 with 5 actions, each <=1, possible only if all U, sum=5<6, impossible. 5 actions, max increase 5, from 3 to 8, not 9.\n\ny_{19} = y_{14} + Δy_{14} + Δy_{15} + Δy_{16} + Δy_{17} + Δy_{18}\n\ny_{14}=3, y_{19}=9, so 9 = 3 + (Δy_{14} to Δy_{18}), so sum of 5 Δy must be 6, impossible since each <=1.\n\nThus, we must reach y=9 at a later turn, like T=20 with more actions.\n\nSo H=9 is indeed minimal.\n\nThus, the sequence is as above.\n\nNow, to write the answer.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 11: D\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nIn the sequence, after turn 19 U, position at turn 20 is y=9.\n\nAnd H=9.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let's confirm the turns.\n\nCurrent turn t_1=11.\n\nSequence of actions: a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nt=0: a_{11} = D\n\nt=1: a_{12} = U\n\nt=2: a_{13} = U\n\n...\n\nt=8: a_{19} = U\n\nH=9.\n\nIn the answer format:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 11: D \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 14: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 15: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 16: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 17: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 18: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 19: U \\end{array} }\n\nBut in the text, it should be written.\n\nSince all from turn 12 to 19 are U, but we have to list.\n\nPerhaps we can say, but I think list all.\n\nIn the collision, we didn't have issue with other freeways because we passed them after the critical times.\n\nFor example, freeway 7 and 8 collisions at T=14,15, but we were at lower y then.\n\nIn our path, at T=14, we are at y=3, not 7.\n\nSo fine.\n\nTherefore, this should be the minimal.\n</think>\nTo reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 2) at turn \\(t_1 = 11\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 9. This requires one downward action (D) to avoid a collision at turn 12, followed by eight upward actions (U) to reach \\(y = 9\\) by turn 20.\n\nThe collision at turn 12 occurs because both freeway 2 (at \\(y = 2\\)) and freeway 3 (at \\(y = 3\\)) have cars covering \\(x = 0\\) at that turn. Specifically:\n- For freeway 2, the car with initial span \\([-23, -12]\\) at turn 11 moves right at speed 12, covering \\(x = 0\\) at turn 12 (relative time \\(\\tau = 1\\).\n- For freeway 3, the car with the same properties also covers \\(x = 0\\) at turn 12.\n\nBy moving down to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 12, the player avoids these collisions, as freeway 1 is safe at turn 12 (span \\([-41, -30]\\) does not cover \\(x = 0\\)). Subsequent upward moves are timed to avoid other collision points:\n- Freeways 7 and 8 have collisions at turns 14 and 15, but the player is at lower \\(y\\)-values (e.g., \\(y = 3\\) at turn 14, \\(y = 4\\) at turn 15) and thus not on these freeways during collisions.\n\nThe sequence of actions minimizes \\(H\\) by using only necessary deviations (one D) and progressing upward efficiently.\n\n**Action Sequence (for turns \\(t_1 + t\\) where \\(t = 0\\) to \\(H-1\\)):**\n\n- At turn 11 (\\(t = 0\\)): Move down (D) to avoid collision at turn 12, resulting in position \\(y = 1\\) at turn 12.\n- At turns 12 to 19 (\\(t = 1\\) to \\(8\\)): Move up (U) each turn to increase \\(y\\) by 1 per turn, reaching \\(y = 9\\) at turn 20.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 11: D \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 14: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 15: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 16: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 17: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 18: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 19: U \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to get the player from (0,1) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t_1 = 12, and the player is at y=1.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing y by +1, -1, or 0 each turn, and y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars move left or right on their freeways. For each car, I have its position at turn t_1=12, and I need to find where it is at future turns to avoid collisions.\n\nA collision happens at turn T if the player is on a freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there's a car where 0 is in its span at that turn. The span changes linearly with time based on speed and direction.\n\nImportant point: if the player moves to a new y at turn T, they are not considered on that new y until the next turn. So, at turn T, the player is on y_T, and if they move, at turn T+1 they'll be on y_{T+1}. But for collision, at turn T, we care about the car on y_T at that turn.\n\nAlso, if the player moves away from a freeway, they won't be collided if the car is there only at that turn or something. But let's read carefully.\n\n\"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T\", which makes sense; at turn T, you are on y_T, so you only check cars on y_T at turn T.\n\nNow, the goal is to reach (0,9), which is the top, I think y=9 is the destination. y=0 to y=9, so y=9 is the top row.\n\nPlayer starts at y=1, needs to go to y=9, so must move up 8 times, but since they can stay or move down, it might take more turns, but we want minimal H, so probably mostly moving up, but avoiding cars.\n\nEach action changes y, so to go from 1 to 9, minimum moves would be 8 up actions, but if there are obstacles, we might need to wait or detour.\n\nBut in this case, since freeways are horizontal and cars are moving, we might need to time when it's safe to be on a certain y.\n\nAlso, y=0 and y=9 might be safe? y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, I think. Freeways are y=1 to y=8, as per \"avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1,…,8\". So y=0 and y=9 have no cars, so they are always safe.\n\nThe player position is (0,y), so x=0 is fixed, I think? The grid is 2D, but player only moves vertically? From the update, y changes, x is not mentioned, so I think player is always at x=0, and moves up/down in y-direction.\n\nCars are on horizontal freeways, each at a fixed y, and they move left-right, so their span in x-direction changes.\n\nCollision when player is at (0,y) and at that turn, for the car on that y, 0 is within the span, meaning a car is covering x=0.\n\nSo, for each freeway y from 1 to 8, I need to know when x=0 is covered by a car on that y.\n\nThen, the player must not be on that y at a turn when x=0 is covered for that y.\n\nNow, given the car states at t=12.\n\nFirst, list all cars for each freeway:\n\nFreeway k=1: cars: (-30, -41, right, 3)\n\nDirection right, so it's moving right, meaning head is at the right end? From the update rule:\n\nFor left-moving: span is [h, τ] with h and τ, and it moves left, so h decreases.\n\nLet's clarify the span notation.\n\nFor left-moving car: at time t, span is [h, τ], and at time T, span is [h - s(T-t), τ - s(T-t)]\n\nSince moving left, positions decrease.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving: span is [τ, h]? Let's see.\n\n\"Right-moving: [Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s (T-t_1), h + s (T-t_1)]\"\n\nIn the table, for each car, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed)\n\nFor freeway 1: (-30, -41, right, 3)\n\nDirection right, so according to the update, for right-moving, span at t_1 is [τ, h], so τ is tail, h is head? But here head is -30, tail is -41, which is less, so if right-moving, span should be [τ, h] with τ < h? -41 < -30, so τ = -41, h = -30, so [τ, h] = [-41, -30], which is increasing, and moving right, so positions increase.\n\nAt time T, span is [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)] = [-41 + 3(T-12), -30 + 3(T-12)]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, collision at turn T for freeway k if player is on y=k at turn T, and for some car on k, 0 is in the span at T.\n\nSo for each freeway, I need to find the times when x=0 is covered.\n\nSince multiple cars per freeway, I need for each freeway, the set of times when it's unsafe, i.e., when some car covers x=0.\n\nThen the player must avoid being on that y at those times.\n\nPlayer starts at turn 12, position y=1.\n\nNow, let's compute for each freeway the times when it's unsafe.\n\nFirst, define t_1 = 12.\n\nFor freeway y=1:\n\nCars: only one car: head=-30, tail=-41, dir=right, speed=3\n\nSo span at time T: [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)] = [-41 + 3(T-12), -30 + 3(T-12)]\n\nx=0 in span if -41 + 3(T-12) ≤ 0 ≤ -30 + 3(T-12)\n\nSet L(T) = -41 + 3(T-12)\n\nH(T) = -30 + 3(T-12)\n\n0 in [L(T), H(T)] if L(T) ≤ 0 ≤ H(T)\n\nSince L(T) ≤ H(T) always.\n\nSo L(T) ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ H(T)\n\nL(T) = -41 + 3(T-12) ≤ 0 ⇒ 3(T-12) ≤ 41 ⇒ T-12 ≤ 41/3 ≈ 13.666 ⇒ T ≤ 12 + 13.666 = 25.666, so T ≤ 25 since T integer? Turns are discrete, I assume integer turns.\n\nSimilarly, 0 ≤ H(T) = -30 + 3(T-12) ⇒ 3(T-12) ≥ 30 ⇒ T-12 ≥ 10 ⇒ T ≥ 22\n\nSo for T from 22 to 25 inclusive, x=0 is covered on y=1.\n\nL(T) ≤ 0: -41 + 3(T-12) ≤ 0 ⇒ 3(T-12) ≤ 41 ⇒ T-12 ≤ 13.666 ⇒ T ≤ 25.666, so T ≤ 25\n\nH(T) ≥ 0: -30 + 3(T-12) ≥ 0 ⇒ 3(T-12) ≥ 30 ⇒ T-12 ≥ 10 ⇒ T ≥ 22\n\nSo unsafe for T=22,23,24,25.\n\nNow, freeway y=2:\n\nCars: (0, -11, right, 12)\n\nOne car: head=0, tail=-11, dir=right, speed=12\n\nSpan at T: [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)] = [-11 + 12(T-12), 0 + 12(T-12)]\n\nSince dir=right, [τ, h] at t_1, so τ=-11, h=0, so [τ, h] = [-11, 0]\n\nAt T: [ -11 + 12(T-12), 0 + 12(T-12) ] = [ -11 + 12(T-12), 12(T-12) ]\n\nx=0 in span if L(T) ≤ 0 ≤ H(T)\n\nL(T) = -11 + 12(T-12)\n\nH(T) = 12(T-12)\n\nL(T) ≤ 0: -11 + 12(T-12) ≤ 0 ⇒ 12(T-12) ≤ 11 ⇒ T-12 ≤ 11/12 ≈ 0.916 ⇒ T ≤ 12.916, so T ≤ 12\n\nBut T ≥ t_1 =12, so at T=12, L(12) = -11 +12(0) = -11 ≤0, H(12) = 0, so 0 ≤ 0 is true, so at T=12, 0 is covered.\n\nFor T>12, L(T) = -11 +12(T-12), at T=12, L= -11, H=0\n\nAs T increases, L and H increase since speed positive.\n\nL(T) ≤ 0: -11 +12(T-12) ≤ 0 ⇒ 12(T-12) ≤ 11 ⇒ T-12 ≤ 11/12 <1, so only for T=12, since T integer.\n\nT-12 ≤ 11/12 ≈0.916, so T-12 <=0 since integer? T-12 is integer, so T-12 <=0, so T<=12.\n\nSimilarly, H(T) >=0: 12(T-12) >=0 always for T>=12.\n\nBut L(T) <=0 only when T=12, because for T=13, L(13) = -11 +12(1) =1 >0, so L(T) >0 for T>12.\n\nAt T=12, L= -11 <=0, H=0 <=0? 0<=0 is true, so 0 is in [L,H].\n\nFor T=13, L= -11+12=1, H=12, so span [1,12], 0 not in [1,12].\n\nSimilarly, for T>13, span moves right, so x=0 not covered except at T=12.\n\nSo on y=2, unsafe only at T=12.\n\nBut player is at y=1 at T=12, not on y=2, so for now, but later if player goes to y=2.\n\nNow freeway y=3: same as y=2? Cars: (0, -11, right, 12)\n\nExactly the same: head=0, tail=-11, dir=right, speed=12\n\nSo similarly, unsafe only at T=12.\n\nFreeway y=4: (0, -11, right, 12) same, unsafe only T=12.\n\nFreeway y=5: (0, -11, right, 12) same, unsafe only T=12.\n\nFreeway y=6: two cars: (0, -11, right, 12) and (-48, -59, right, 12)\n\nFirst car: same as above, (0, -11, right, 12), unsafe only at T=12.\n\nSecond car: head=-48, tail=-59, dir=right, speed=12\n\nSpan at t_1: since right, [τ, h] = [-59, -48]? head=-48, tail=-59, so if dir right, [τ, h] with τ=-59, h=-48, so [-59, -48]\n\nAt T: [ -59 + 12(T-12), -48 + 12(T-12) ]\n\nx=0 in span if L(T) <=0 <= H(T)\n\nL(T) = -59 +12(T-12)\n\nH(T) = -48 +12(T-12)\n\nL(T) <=0: -59 +12(T-12) <=0 => 12(T-12) <=59 => T-12 <= 59/12 ≈4.916 => T <= 16.916, so T<=16\n\nH(T) >=0: -48 +12(T-12) >=0 => 12(T-12) >=48 => T-12 >=4 => T>=16\n\nSo for T=16, L= -59+12(4)= -59+48= -11 <=0, H= -48+48=0 >=0, so 0 in span.\n\nFor T=17, L= -59+12(5)= -59+60=1>0, H= -48+60=12>0, span [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo second car unsafe only at T=16.\n\nBut for freeway y=6, there are two cars, so unsafe if either car covers x=0 at that turn.\n\nFirst car covers at T=12, second at T=16.\n\nSo y=6 unsafe at T=12 and T=16.\n\nNow freeway y=7: cars: (-12, -23, right, 6) and (36, 25, right, 6)? (36, 25, right, 6)\n\nHead and tail: for first car: head=-12, tail=-23, dir=right, speed=6\n\nSecond car: head=36, tail=25? 36>25, but if dir right, span should be [τ, h] with τ < h, so if head=36, tail=25, then τ=25, h=36? But given as (head, tail), so for second car, head=36, tail=25, but 36>25, so if dir right, τ=25, h=36, so [25,36] at t_1.\n\nSimilarly, first car head=-12, tail=-23, so τ=-23, h=-12, [-23,-12] at t_1.\n\nNow, both dir right, speed 6.\n\nFirst car: span at T: [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)] = [-23 + 6(T-12), -12 + 6(T-12)]\n\nx=0 in span if L(T) <=0 <= H(T)\n\nL(T) = -23 +6(T-12)\n\nH(T) = -12 +6(T-12)\n\nL(T) <=0: -23 +6(T-12) <=0 => 6(T-12) <=23 => T-12 <= 23/6 ≈3.833 => T <= 15.833, so T<=15\n\nH(T) >=0: -12 +6(T-12) >=0 => 6(T-12) >=12 => T-12 >=2 => T>=14\n\nSo for T=14,15: at T=14, L= -23+6(2)= -23+12= -11<=0, H= -12+12=0>=0\n\nT=15, L= -23+18= -5<=0? -5 <=0 true, H= -12+18=6>=0, span [-5,6], 0 in it.\n\nT=16, L= -23+24=1>0, H= -12+24=12>0, not include 0.\n\nSo first car unsafe at T=14 and T=15.\n\nNow second car on y=7: head=36, tail=25, dir=right, speed=6\n\nSpan at t_1: [τ, h] = [25, 36] since τ=25, h=36\n\nAt T: [25 + 6(T-12), 36 + 6(T-12)]\n\nL(T) =25 +6(T-12) which for T>=12 is at least 25>0, so L(T) >0 always for T>=12, so 0 never <= L(T), so x=0 never covered by this car. Since min position is 25 at t=12, moving right, so always x>25, so x=0 not covered.\n\nSimilarly, H(T) >0 always.\n\nSo only the first car matters for y=7, unsafe at T=14 and T=15.\n\nNow freeway y=8: cars: (-12, -23, right, 6) and (36, 25, right, 6) same as y=7.\n\nSo similarly, unsafe at T=14 and T=15.\n\nNow summarize unsafe times for each freeway:\n\ny=1: unsafe T=22,23,24,25\n\ny=2: unsafe T=12\n\ny=3: unsafe T=12\n\ny=4: unsafe T=12\n\ny=5: unsafe T=12\n\ny=6: unsafe T=12 and T=16\n\ny=7: unsafe T=14,15\n\ny=8: unsafe T=14,15\n\ny=0 and y=9 have no cars, always safe.\n\nPlayer starts at turn 12, y=1.\n\nAt turn 12, y=1: is it safe? y=1 unsafe at T=22-25, not at T=12, so at T=12, y=1 is safe.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nMinimal turns: since from y=1 to y=9, need to increase by 8, so at least 8 turns if all up moves. But might need to wait or avoid.\n\nBut with obstacles, might take more.\n\nSince we can stay or move down, but moving down might not help since we need to go up, but to avoid being at a y when unsafe.\n\nNow, let's list the unsafe periods:\n\nFor y=2,3,4,5,6: unsafe only at T=12, so after T=12, they are safe except y=6 also unsafe at T=16.\n\ny=1 unsafe later, y=7 and 8 unsafe at T=14,15.\n\nPlayer at T=12, y=1, which is safe.\n\nNow, we need to go up to y=9.\n\nPossible to go directly up, but need to check when each y is unsafe.\n\nSince y=2,3,4,5 are only unsafe at T=12, and T=12 is now, player is not on them, so for future turns, y=2,3,4,5 are always safe after T=12, since no other unsafe times.\n\ny=2 unsafe only T=12, so for T>12, y=2 is safe.\n\nSimilarly y=3,4,5 same.\n\ny=6 unsafe at T=12 and T=16, so for T>12 except T=16, it is safe? T=16 unsafe, other times safe.\n\ny=7 unsafe at T=14 and 15, so safe at other times.\n\ny=8 same as y=7.\n\ny=1 unsafe at T=22-25, so for T not in 22-25, safe, but since we start at T=12, and need to reach quickly, probably we don't care about later times if we can reach before.\n\nNow, player at T=12, y=1.\n\nWe can move up to y=2 at some point.\n\nTo minimize turns, we should move up as much as possible, but avoid being on a y when it is unsafe.\n\nSince from y=1 to y=9, we need to pass through y=2 to y=8.\n\nBut we can stay or move down to avoid unsafe times.\n\nBut moving down might delay, so probably not helpful unless necessary.\n\nNow, let's think about the unsafe times relative to the path.\n\nSince y=2,3,4,5 are safe for all T>12, we can be on them anytime except T=12, but T=12 is past, so fine.\n\ny=6 is safe except at T=16.\n\ny=7 safe except T=14,15.\n\ny=8 same.\n\ny=1 is safe except T=22-25, but if we move up quickly, we might not be affected.\n\nNow, we start at T=12, y=1, safe.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 by some turn H.\n\nEach move, we can change y by -1,0,+1.\n\nTo go from 1 to 9, net +8, so minimum 8 moves up.\n\nIf we move up every turn, we reach y=9 at turn 12 + 8 = turn 20? Let's see.\n\nAt turn T, y_T.\n\nStart: T=12, y=1\n\nIf action U at T=12, then at T=13, y=2\n\nU at T=13, T=14, y=3\n\nU at T=14, T=15, y=4\n\nU at T=15, T=16, y=5\n\nU at T=16, T=17, y=6\n\nU at T=17, T=18, y=7\n\nU at T=18, T=19, y=8\n\nU at T=19, T=20, y=9\n\nNow, we need to check for each turn, when player is on y=2 to y=8, if it is safe at that turn.\n\nIn this sequence:\n\nAt T=13, y=2: y=2 unsafe only T=12, not 13, so safe.\n\nT=14, y=3: y=3 unsafe only T=12, not 14, safe.\n\nT=15, y=4: similarly safe.\n\nT=16, y=5: y=5 unsafe only T=12, not 16, safe.\n\nT=17, y=6: y=6 unsafe at T=16, not 17? T=16 unsafe, but at T=17, y=6.\n\ny=6 unsafe times: T=12 and T=16.\n\nAt T=17, not unsafe, so should be safe.\n\nThen T=18, y=7: y=7 unsafe at T=14 and 15, not 18, so safe.\n\nT=19, y=8: unsafe at T=14,15, not 19, safe.\n\nT=20, y=9, safe, no cars.\n\nBut at T=17, y=6 is safe? y=6 unsafe only at T=12 and T=16, so at T=17, it is safe.\n\nIn the sequence above, at T=16, player is at y=5? Let's list the turn and y:\n\n- T=12: y=1 (safe)\n\nAction U at T=12, so at T=13, y=2\n\n- T=13: y=2 (safe)\n\nAction U at T=13, T=14, y=3\n\n- T=14: y=3 (safe? y=3 unsafe only T=12, so at T=14, safe)\n\nBut at T=14, player is on y=3, which is safe.\n\nIn the sequence, at T=14, y=3.\n\ny=3 is freeway, but unsafe only at T=12, so at T=14, safe.\n\nSimilarly, T=15: y=4 (safe)\n\nT=16: y=5 (safe)\n\nT=17: y=6 (safe, since not T=16)\n\nT=18: y=7 (y=7 unsafe at T=14,15, not 18, safe)\n\nT=19: y=8 (safe)\n\nT=20: y=9 (safe)\n\nAnd we reached at turn 20.\n\nBut is there any problem?\n\nWhat about y=7 and y=8 being unsafe at T=14 and 15.\n\nIn this path, player is not on y=7 or y=8 at T=14 or 15; at T=14, y=3; T=15, y=4.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nSimilarly, y=6 unsafe at T=16, but at T=16, player is on y=5, not y=6.\n\nSo all safe.\n\nAnd H=8 turns, from T=12 to T=19 actions? Let's see the actions.\n\nActions from t_1 to t_1 + H-1, with H turns.\n\nStart at turn t_1=12.\n\nAfter H turns, at turn t_1 + H -1? Let's clarify.\n\nThe sequence of actions: {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1\n\nAfter applying a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H-1}, the position at turn t_1 + H should be (0,9)? Not sure.\n\nDefine:\n\nAt turn T, position y_T.\n\nAction a_T is applied at turn T, to determine y_{T+1}.\n\nFrom the player update:\n\ny_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with Δy_t based on a_t.\n\nSo, at turn t, we choose a_t, which affects y_{t+1}.\n\nThe position at turn t is y_t.\n\nTo reach (0,9), I think we need y_T = 9 for some T.\n\nThe task says: \"reach (0,9)\", and \"y_{t_1 + H -1} = 9\"\n\nIn the task: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} which minimizes H such that y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\ny_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9.\n\nNow, t_1 =12.\n\nSo after actions from a_{12} to a_{12 + H -1}, the position at turn (12 + H -1) is y=9.\n\nThe actions are for t from 0 to H-1, so a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, so a_{12} to a_{12 + H -1}, total H actions.\n\nAfter these actions, at turn (12 + H -1), y=9.\n\nFor example, if H=1, actions a_{12}, then at turn 12 +1 -1 =12, y=9, but start at y=1, so impossible.\n\nMinimal H: since from y=1 to y=9, need to increase by 8, so at least 8 actions if all up, but with actions, each up move increases y by 1, so after k up moves, y increases by k.\n\nBut we can have stay or down, which don't increase or decrease.\n\nTo reach y=9 from y=1, the minimal number of actions is 8, all up, if no obstacles.\n\nWith obstacles, might need more if we have to wait.\n\nIn this case, with the sequence above, we can do 8 up moves.\n\nIn the sequence I thought:\n\nStart T=12, y=1\n\na_{12} = U, then T=13, y=2\n\na_{13} = U, T=14, y=3\n\na_{14} = U, T=15, y=4\n\na_{15} = U, T=16, y=5\n\na_{16} = U, T=17, y=6\n\na_{17} = U, T=18, y=7\n\na_{18} = U, T=19, y=8\n\na_{19} = U, T=20, y=9\n\nNow, at turn t_1 + H -1 = 12 + H -1 should be 20 when y=9.\n\nSo 12 + H -1 =20 ⇒ 11 + H =20 ⇒ H=9\n\nActions from t=0 to H-1, so for H=9, actions a_{12} to a_{20}, but a_{20} would affect y_{21}, we don't care.\n\ny_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{12 + H -1} =9\n\nIn above, at turn 20, y=9, so 12 + H -1 =20 ⇒ H-1=8 ⇒ H=9\n\nThe position at turn 20 is after action at turn 19.\n\nActions: a_{12} to a_{19}, that's 8 actions? Indices.\n\nSet k = t_1 + t, t from 0 to H-1, so k from t_1 to t_1 + H -1\n\nAfter applying a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1}, the state at turn (t_1 + H -1) has y=9.\n\nIn terms of turns: at turn T, before action, position y_T.\n\nAfter choosing a_T, y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy_T.\n\nSo to have y_T =9 at some T.\n\nSpecifically, y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nIn the sequence above, at turn 20, y=9, so t_1 + H -1 =20, t_1=12, so 12 + H -1 =20 ⇒ H-1=8 ⇒ H=9.\n\nActions: a_{12}, a_{13}, ..., a_{19}, that is 8 actions? From a_{12} to a_{19}, that's 8 actions, but H=9? t from 0 to H-1, so for H=9, t=0 to 8, actions a_{12+0}=a_{12} to a_{12+8}=a_{20}, but a_{20} would be applied, affecting y_{21}, but we only care up to y_{20}=9.\n\nIn the sequence, we have actions up to a_{19} to reach y_{20}=9.\n\nSo for y_{20}=9, we need to have applied actions from a_{12} to a_{19}, that's 8 actions.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =20, t_1=12, so 12 + H -1 =20 ⇒ 11 + H =20 ⇒ H=9.\n\nBut with H=9, actions from t=0 to 8, a_{12} to a_{19}, yes, 9 actions: t=0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 → a_{12} to a_{19}? t=0: a_{12}, t=1: a_{13}, ..., t=8: a_{20}, but a_{20} is not needed.\n\nInconsistency.\n\nDefine: the actions are a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nAfter applying these, y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nFor example, if H=1, actions a_{t_1}, which affects y_{t_1 +1}, but we want y_{t_1 +1 -1} = y_{t_1} =9, which may not be.\n\nGenerally, after applying a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1}, we get y_{t_1 + H} from a_{t_1 + H -1}, but the position at turn t_1 + H -1 is before action a_{t_1 + H -1}, I think.\n\nI'm confused.\n\nRead carefully:\n\n\"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\", and \"y_{t_1 + H -1} =9\"\n\nThe actions are applied at turns t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nAt turn T, we apply a_T, which sets y_{T+1}.\n\nSo the position y_T is at the beginning of turn T.\n\nAfter applying a_T, we have y_{T+1}.\n\nTo have y_K =9 for some K.\n\nHere K = t_1 + H -1.\n\nFor K = t_1 + H -1, y_K =9.\n\nIn terms of actions, to achieve y_K=9, we need the actions from t_1 to K-1 or something.\n\nSince we start at t_1 with y_{t_1} given.\n\nThen after actions a_{t_1} to a_{K-1}, we get y_K.\n\nFor y_K =9, with K = t_1 + H -1.\n\nSo the actions needed are from a_{t_1} to a_{K-1}.\n\nSince K = t_1 + H -1, then K - t_1 = H -1.\n\nSo actions from a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + (H-1) -1}? Let's index.\n\nThe actions are for t=0 to H-1: a_{t_1 + t}\n\nWhen we apply a_{t_1 + t} at turn t_1 + t, it affects y_{t_1 + t +1}\n\nAfter all actions, y_{t_1 + H} is set, but we want y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\ny_{t_1 + H -1} is the position at turn t_1 + H -1, before action a_{t_1 + H -1}.\n\nTo have y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, it must be that we reach y=9 at that turn, and no action is applied if we are already there, but since we start from y=1, we need to move.\n\nFor example, at turn t_1 + H -1, y=9, which is achieved by previous actions.\n\nThe last action that affected it is a_{t_1 + H -2}, which sets y_{t_1 + H -1}.\n\ny_{t_1 + H -1} is set by a_{t_1 + H -2}.\n\nSimilarly, y_{t_1} is given, set by previous, but at start.\n\nTo have y_K =9 with K = t_1 + H -1.\n\nThe actions from a_{t_1} to a_{K-1} determine y_K.\n\nSince K = t_1 + H -1, so K-1 = t_1 + H -2.\n\nActions from a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -2} are applied, setting y_{t_1 +1} to y_{t_1 + H -1}.\n\ny_{t_1} is given.\n\nAfter a_{t_1}, y_{t_1 +1} set.\n\n...\n\nAfter a_{t_1 + H -2}, y_{t_1 + H -1} set.\n\nSo to have y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, we need actions from a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -2}, which are H-1 actions.\n\nBut the sequence is from t=0 to H-1 for a_{t_1 + t}, which includes a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1}.\n\nFor y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, the action a_{t_1 + H -1} is not used to set it, because a_{t_1 + H -1} sets y_{t_1 + H}, which is after.\n\nSo in the sequence, a_{t_1 + H -1} is applied, but it affects the next turn, which is not of interest since we stop when we reach.\n\nBut in the condition, we only care that at turn t_1 + H -1, y=9, and the actions up to a_{t_1 + H -1} are given, but a_{t_1 + H -1} might be irrelevant or could be S or something.\n\nTo minimize H, we should have the actions such that we reach as soon as possible.\n\nIn the direct path I thought, we reach y=9 at turn 20.\n\nAt turn 20, y=9, so K=20.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =20, t_1=12, so 12 + H -1 =20, H-1=8, H=9.\n\nActions from t=0 to 8: a_{12} to a_{19}? t=0: a_{12}, t=1: a_{13}, ..., t=8: a_{20}, but a_{20} is for turn 20, which sets y_{21}, but we don't care about y_{21}.\n\nBut in the sequence, for H=9, actions a_{12} to a_{20}, but a_{20} is not needed since we are already at y=9 at turn 20.\n\nHowever, the condition is y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, which is y_{20} for H=9, and we have it.\n\nBut the action a_{20} is specified, but it doesn't affect the position at turn 20, since y_{20} is before a_{20}.\n\nSo we can set a_{20} to S or U or D, it doesn't matter, but probably we should set it to S or something, but since we reached, it's fine.\n\nTo save actions, we might not need the last action if we reach earlier, but in this case, with 8 up moves, we reach at turn 20 from turn 12.\n\nFrom turn 12 to turn 20, that's 8 turns later, but turns are discrete.\n\nAt turn 12, position.\n\nAfter first action a_{12}, at turn 13, new position.\n\n...\n\nAfter a_{19}, at turn 20, position.\n\nSo from turn 12 to turn 20, we have 8 actions: a_{12} to a_{19}, setting y_{13} to y_{20}.\n\nAt turn 20, y=9.\n\nNow, for y_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{12 + H -1} =9.\n\nSet 12 + H -1 =20, so H-1=8, H=9.\n\nWith H=9, actions a_{12} to a_{20}, but a_{20} is for turn 20, which sets y_{21}, not needed.\n\nBut in the sequence, we include a_{20}, which can be arbitrary since it doesn't affect reaching at turn 20.\n\nTo have minimal H, we can have H such that we reach at turn t_1 + H -1 with fewer actions if we move faster, but we can't move faster than 1 per turn.\n\nMinimal H is 9 for reaching at turn 20.\n\nIf we can reach earlier, but from y=1, to y=9, earliest at turn 20 with 8 up moves.\n\nStart turn 12 y=1, after a_{12}=U, turn 13 y=2, ..., after a_{19}=U, turn 20 y=9.\n\nSo turn 20 is the earliest possible to be at y=9.\n\nAnd in this path, as I checked earlier, all positions are safe at the times.\n\nBut let's confirm the safety during the path.\n\nPlayer position at each turn:\n\nTurn T | y_T | Freeway | Unsafe? | Safe?\n\nT=12: y=1, freeway y=1, unsafe at T=22-25, not 12, so safe.\n\nT=13: y=2, freeway y=2, unsafe only T=12, not 13, safe.\n\nT=14: y=3, freeway y=3, unsafe only T=12, not 14, safe.\n\nT=15: y=4, freeway y=4, unsafe only T=12, not 15, safe.\n\nT=16: y=5, freeway y=5, unsafe only T=12, not 16, safe.\n\nT=17: y=6, freeway y=6, unsafe at T=12 and T=16, not 17, so safe.\n\nT=18: y=7, freeway y=7, unsafe at T=14 and 15, not 18, safe.\n\nT=19: y=8, freeway y=8, unsafe at T=14 and 15, not 19, safe.\n\nT=20: y=9, not a freeway, safe.\n\nSo all good.\n\nBut at T=14 and T=15, y=7 and y=8 are unsafe, but player is not on them; player is on y=3 and y=4 at those times.\n\nSimilarly, at T=16, y=6 unsafe, but player on y=5.\n\nSo no collision.\n\nTherefore, with H=9, we can reach at turn 20 with actions all U from a_{12} to a_{19}, and a_{20} for the sequence, but in the action sequence for H=9, we need a_{20}, which can be S, for example.\n\nBut in the answer, we list actions from turn t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nSo for H=9, actions a_{12} to a_{20}.\n\na_{12} to a_{19} are U, a_{20} can be S, since we are at y=9, and if we stay, y_{21}=9 still.\n\nBut since we only care up to turn t_1 + H -1 =20, action a_{20} is specified but not necessary, but we have to include it.\n\nTo be precise.\n\nBut in this case, with all U, we can reach.\n\nBut is there a way with fewer turns? H smaller?\n\nMinimal H: since we need to go from y=1 to y=9, minimum 8 steps, but in terms of H, with H actions, the position at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nIf we start at turn t_1 with y_t1, after H-1 actions, we can be at y_{t1 + H -1}.\n\nWith k up moves, y increases by k.\n\nTo have y_{t1 + H -1} =9, from y_t1=1, so we need exactly H-1 up moves if no other actions, but we can have stays or down, but that would require more actions or same.\n\nWith S or D, we might reach later, so minimal H is when we have H-1 up moves and no S or D, so y_{t1 + H -1} =1 + (H-1) *1 if all U, so 1 + H -1 = H, set to 9, so H=9.\n\ny_{t1 + H -1} = y_t1 + sum of Δy from t=t1 to t1 + H -2.\n\nActions from a_t1 to a_{t1 + H -2} affect y_{t1+1} to y_{t1 + H -1}.\n\ny_{t1 + H -1} is set by a_{t1 + H -2}.\n\nTo have y_{t1 + H -1} =9, with y_t1=1, so the net change from actions a_t1 to a_{t1 + H -2} must be +8.\n\nEach U contributes +1, D contributes -1, S contributes 0.\n\nSo number of U minus number of D must be 8.\n\nWith H-1 actions (from a_t1 to a_{t1 + H -2}), but the sequence has H actions: a_t1 to a_{t1 + H -1}.\n\nFor the position at t1 + H -1, the action a_{t1 + H -1} doesn't affect it; it affects future.\n\nSo to achieve y_{t1 + H -1} =9, we need the actions before it to have brought y to 9.\n\nWith minimal H, we can have exactly 8 U moves in the first H-1 actions or something.\n\nBut to minimize H, we should have no S or D, all U in the actions that increase y.\n\nThe earliest turn to be at y=9 is turn 20, with y_{20}=9.\n\nt1 + H -1 =20, H=9.\n\nIf we reach earlier, impossible because from y=1 at turn 12, after one action at turn 12, y_{13} <=2, ..., at turn 19, y_{19} <=8 if we move up each time, at turn 20 y=9.\n\nSo turn 20 is earliest.\n\nThus H=9 is minimal.\n\nAnd with the all-up path, it works with no collisions.\n\nBut in the sequence, for freeway y=6, it is unsafe at T=16, and at T=16, in the path, player is at y=5, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nBut let's double-check if there are any other constraints.\n\nPerhaps we can reach faster, but no.\n\nAnother thing: at turn 12, player is at y=1, and we move up immediately.\n\nBut y=1 is safe at T=12.\n\nIn the car list, for y=6, there is a car at T=16, but we are not there.\n\nPerhaps we need to output the sequence.\n\nBut the problem is to find minimal H and the sequence.\n\nWith H=9, actions: a_{12} = U, a_{13} = U, a_{14} = U, a_{15} = U, a_{16} = U, a_{17} = U, a_{18} = U, a_{19} = U, and for a_{20}, since we need to include, and y_{20}=9, we can set a_{20}=S, for example.\n\nIn the sequence, it should be fine.\n\nBut let's see if we can avoid a_{20}, but H=9 requires it.\n\nPerhaps with H=8.\n\nIf H=8, then t1 + H -1 =12+8-1=19, so y_{19} should be 9.\n\nBut at turn 19, if we start from y_12=1, with actions a12 to a18 (since for y19, set by a18), we have 7 actions from a12 to a18, each can change y.\n\nMax y at turn 19: if all U, y13=2, y14=3, ..., y19=8.\n\ny19=8, not 9.\n\nTo have y19=9, we need to be at y=8 at turn 18, and a18=U, then y19=9.\n\nBut at turn 18, y=8, which is possible, but y19=9.\n\nFor H=8, y_{12+8-1}=y_{19}=9.\n\nNow, with actions from a12 to a17? Actions a_t for t=12 to 12+H-1=12+7=19? H=8, t from 0 to 7, actions a12 to a19.\n\ny_{t1 + H -1} = y_{19} =9.\n\ny19 is set by a18.\n\na18 applied at turn 18 sets y19.\n\nSo with a18=U, and at turn 18, y18=8.\n\nNow, to have y18=8, from y12=1, we need net +7 in 6 actions (a12 to a17).\n\nWith a12 to a17: 6 actions, to increase y from 1 to 8, net +7, possible with 7 U and one S, but 6 actions, min net increase: 6 U would give y18=1+6=7, not 8.\n\ny12=1\n\nAfter a12, y13 = y12 + Δy12\n\n...\n\nAfter a17, y18 = y17 + Δy17\n\ny18 is position at turn 18.\n\nTo have y18=8, with y12=1, need the changes from a12 to a17 to sum to +7.\n\nBut a12 to a17: 6 actions, each +1,0,-1, so max sum +6, so y18 <=1+6=7, cannot be 8.\n\nThus impossible to have y18=8 or y19=9 with H=8? y19=9.\n\ny19 set by a18.\n\na18 applied at turn 18, sets y19.\n\nTo have y19=9, need that at turn 18, y18 + Δy18 =9.\n\nSince y18 <=8 (from previous), if y18=8 and a18=U, then y19=9.\n\nBut y18 <=7 with actions from a12 to a17.\n\ny12=1\n\nAfter a12, y13 <=2\n\n...\n\nAfter a17, y18 <=1 + 6 =7 (since 6 actions a12 to a17)\n\nThen y18 <=7, so y19 <=8 if a18=U, cannot be 9.\n\nIf a18=D, y19<8, worse.\n\nSo indeed, impossible to reach y=9 before turn 20.\n\nThus minimal H is 9, reaching at turn 20.\n\nNow, in the sequence, with all U, it works.\n\nBut in the actions, for H=9, we have a12 to a20.\n\na12 to a19 should be U, a20 can be S.\n\nIn the path, at turn 20, y=9, so a20 can be S to stay.\n\nNow, but let's confirm if at any point we might have issue.\n\nAnother thing: when moving, the collision is only at the position at that turn.\n\nIn this case, all safe.\n\nPerhaps we can start with stay or something, but that would delay, not necessary.\n\nSo this should be fine.\n\nNow, the answer format.\n\nBut in the car for freeway 7 and 8, there is a second car, but I think I handled it.\n\nFor y=7, second car (36,25,right,6), which I said never covers x=0, which is correct.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo I think it's ok.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=9, with actions all U except last action S or something.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nTurn 20: S  (since at y=9, stay)\n\nBut action at turn 20 sets y21, but we don't care.\n\nIn the sequence, for turn 20, we can put S.\n\nSince we reached at turn 20, and action at turn 20 is for after, but we have to specify.\n\nIn the answer, it should be fine.\n\nTo save, but H is fixed.\n\nAnother point: at turn 16, when we are at y=5, and y=6 is unsafe, but we are not on it.\n\nSimilarly, no problem.\n\nPerhaps we need to avoid being on y=7 or 8 at T=14,15, but we are not.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n\nBut let's see the initial position: player at (0,1) at turn 12.\n\nAnd we move up each turn.\n\nIn the action sequence, for H=9.\n\nNow, write in the box.\n\nBut the answer should be the sequence of actions.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nTurn 20: S\n\nBut for turn 20, since y=9, and we stay, but action S is fine.\n\nWe could put U, but y=9, if U, y21=10, but y max 9? y in [0,9], so if at y=9, U might not be allowed? The update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with y_{t+1} in [0,9], so if y_t=9, a_t=U, then y_{t+1} =10, which is invalid, so probably not allowed, or it clamps, but not specified.\n\nFrom the update: \"y_{t+1} \\in [0,9]\", so it must be within bounds.\n\nSo if y_t=9, a_t=U, y_{t+1}=10 not in [0,9], so invalid action, probably not allowed.\n\nSimilarly, if y_t=0, a_t=D, y_{t+1}=-1 invalid.\n\nSo actions must be such that y remains in [0,9].\n\nIn this case, at turn 20, y=9, so a_{20} cannot be U, must be S or D, but D would go to 8, not desired, so should be S.\n\nSimilarly, in the sequence, at turn 19, y=8, a_{19}=U, y_{20}=9.\n\nThen at turn 20, y=9, a_{20} must be S or D, but since we are at destination, probably S.\n\nSo in the action list, a_{20}=S.\n\nNow, for the sequence.\n\nBut in the answer, we need to list from turn 12 to turn 20.\n\nNow, but H=9, and it works.\n\nBut is there a shorter path? No.\n\nPerhaps we can reach with H=9 but different actions if needed, but here all U is fine.\n\nAnother thing: at turn 14 and 15, y=7 and y=8 are unsafe, but if we were to be on them, we need to avoid, but in this path we are not.\n\nSuppose we go up slower, but that would take more turns.\n\nFor example, if we stay at some point, then we reach later, H larger.\n\nSo minimal is this.\n\nThus, the sequence is as above.\n\nNow, to write in the box.\n\nBut let's confirm the car on y=1.\n\ny=1 unsafe at T=22-25, which is later, not issue.\n\nAlso, for y=6 at T=16, unsafe, but at T=16, we are at y=5.\n\nIn the sequence, at T=16, y=5.\n\ny=5 is freeway, but unsafe only at T=12, not 16, so safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nSo minimal H=9.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nTurn 20: S\n\nNow, in the answer format.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 1) at turn \\(t_1 = 12\\) and needs to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\). The unsafe times for each freeway, derived from the car states at turn 12, are as follows:\n\n- Freeway \\(y = 1\\): unsafe at turns 22, 23, 24, 25\n- Freeway \\(y = 2\\): unsafe only at turn 12\n- Freeway \\(y = 3\\): unsafe only at turn 12\n- Freeway \\(y = 4\\): unsafe only at turn 12\n- Freeway \\(y = 5\\): unsafe only at turn 12\n- Freeway \\(y = 6\\): unsafe at turns 12 and 16\n- Freeway \\(y = 7\\): unsafe at turns 14 and 15\n- Freeway \\(y = 8\\): unsafe at turns 14 and 15\n\nThe minimal \\(H\\) to reach \\(y = 9\\) from \\(y = 1\\) is 9, as it requires at least 8 upward moves to increase the y-coordinate by 8, and the earliest possible turn to reach \\(y = 9\\) is turn 20 (since starting at turn 12, after 8 up moves, the player reaches \\(y = 9\\) at turn 20). Thus, \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 20\\) with \\(t_1 = 12\\) gives \\(H = 9\\).\n\nThe sequence of actions to achieve this with no collisions is:\n- Always move up (U) from turn 12 to turn 19 to reach \\(y = 9\\) by turn 20.\n- At turn 20, since the player is at \\(y = 9\\) (the destination and a safe row with no cars), the action is stay (S) to remain within bounds.\n\nThe player's position at each turn is:\n- Turn 12: \\(y = 1\\) (safe, as \\(y = 1\\) is unsafe only at turns 22-25)\n- Turn 13: \\(y = 2\\) (safe, as \\(y = 2\\) is unsafe only at turn 12)\n- Turn 14: \\(y = 3\\) (safe, as \\(y = 3\\) is unsafe only at turn 12)\n- Turn 15: \\(y = 4\\) (safe, as \\(y = 4\\) is unsafe only at turn 12)\n- Turn 16: \\(y = 5\\) (safe, as \\(y = 5\\) is unsafe only at turn 12)\n- Turn 17: \\(y = 6\\) (safe, as \\(y = 6\\) is unsafe at turns 12 and 16, but not at 17)\n- Turn 18: \\(y = 7\\) (safe, as \\(y = 7\\) is unsafe at turns 14-15, but not at 18)\n- Turn 19: \\(y = 8\\) (safe, as \\(y = 8\\) is unsafe at turns 14-15, but not at 19)\n- Turn 20: \\(y = 9\\) (safe, no cars)\n\nThis path avoids all unsafe times, and \\(H = 9\\) is minimal.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 12: U \\\\\nTurn 13: U \\\\\nTurn 14: U \\\\\nTurn 15: U \\\\\nTurn 16: U \\\\\nTurn 17: U \\\\\nTurn 18: U \\\\\nTurn 19: U \\\\\nTurn 20: S\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to get the player from (0,2) at turn t1=13 to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The player moves vertically with actions U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), or S (stay, y no change), and y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars move horizontally on their freeways. For each car, I have its position at turn t1, and I need to compute where it will be at future turns to avoid the player being on the same freeway when the car's span includes x=0.\n\nThe collision rule says: collision occurs at turn T if the player is on freeway y_T and for some car on that freeway, 0 is in the car's span at turn T.\n\nAlso, importantly, if the player moves to a different freeway at turn T, they are not on that freeway until turn T+1. So, at turn T, they are on y_T, and if they move, at T+1 they are on y_{T+1}.\n\nLet me denote the current turn as t = 13, and the player is at y=2.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nThe minimal number of turns would be at least the vertical distance: from y=2 to y=9, that's 7 steps up, so H >= 7 if I go directly up. But I might need to wait or go down to avoid cars, so H could be more than 7.\n\nBut I should try to go up directly if possible, avoiding collisions.\n\nFirst, I need to model where the cars are at each future turn.\n\nThe car positions are given at turn t1=13.\n\nFor each car, the span is given as (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nDirection: right or left. In the table, for freeway k, it has cars with (h, τ, d, s).\n\nFor right-moving cars: the span is [τ, h] with τ < h, I assume, since it's moving right. Similarly for left-moving, [h, τ] with h < τ? Let's see the notation.\n\nFrom the update rule:\n\n- Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → at T, [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]\n\nSince it's moving left, decreasing x.\n\nIn the span [h, τ], if it's left-moving, h should be the head, so for left-moving, head at h, tail at τ, and since moving left, h < τ? But in the notation, it says for left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ], and then at T, [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT], so if moving left, h and τ decrease.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h]? It says: for right-moving, \"Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT]\", so τ is the left end, h is the right end for right-moving cars.\n\nIn the car state table, for each car, it's given as (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s).\n\nBut in the span definition, for right-moving, it uses [τ, h], and for left-moving, [h, τ].\n\nI think there might be inconsistency in what \"head\" means.\n\nLet me read carefully.\n\nFor left-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, τ]\" and it moves to [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT], so if moving left, h is the right end? That might be confusing.\n\nPerhaps \"head\" is always the front of the car.\n\nFor a left-moving car, the front is at smaller x, so head h is smaller than tail τ, so [h, τ] with h < τ.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving, head h is larger than tail τ, so [τ, h] with τ < h.\n\nIn the notation: for freeway 1: (-27, -38, right, 3)\n\nDirection right, so it should be [τ, h] with τ < h.\n\nHere h = -27, τ = -38? -27 > -38, so if direction right, and [τ, h] = [-38, -27], since τ = -38, h = -27, so tail at -38, head at -27, moving right.\n\nAt T, span [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT]\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but in this case, all cars seem to be right-moving except possibly some, but let's see.\n\nIn the car state:\n\nFreeway 1: (-27, -38, right, 3) so [τ, h] = [-38, -27] at t1=13.\n\nFreeway 2: (12, 1, right, 12) so [τ, h] = [1,12]? h=12, τ=1, so [1,12]\n\nSimilarly for 3,4,5 same as 2? Freeway 3: (12,1,right,12) same as 2.\n\nFreeway 4: same.\n\nFreeway 5: same.\n\nFreeway 6: (12,1,right,12), (-36,-47,right,12) two cars.\n\nFirst car [1,12], second car [-47,-36]? τ=-47, h=-36, so [-47,-36]\n\nFreeway 7: (-6,-17,right,6), (42,31,right,6) let's see: first car, h=-6, τ=-17, direction right, so [τ, h] = [-17,-6]? τ=-17, h=-6, so [-17,-6]\n\nBut direction right, moving right, so at T, [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT]\n\nSecond car: (42,31,right,6) h=42, τ=31, so [31,42]\n\nSimilarly freeway 8: same as 7.\n\nNow, collision occurs at turn T if player is on freeway k at turn T, and for some car on freeway k, 0 is in the span at T.\n\nPlayer is at (0, y_t), so x=0 always, we care about when y_t = k, and 0 in car's span on that k.\n\nAlso, at turn T, when player takes action, they move to y_{T+1} for the next position, but for collision at T, it depends on y_T and the car at T.\n\nLet me define ΔT = T - t1 = T - 13 for future turns.\n\nAt turn T, car positions are computed based on ΔT.\n\nPlayer starts at turn 13, y=2.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\nThe freeways are y=1 to 8, each with cars.\n\ny=0 and y=9 have no cars, I assume, since freeways are y=1 to 8. Player starts at y=2, which is freeway 2? No, freeways are the rows where cars are, y=1 to 8 are the freeway levels. Player position y_t indicates which row they are on at time t.\n\nAt time t, if y_t = k for k=1 to 8, they are on freeway k, and must avoid cars on that freeway at time t.\n\nFor y=0 and y=9, no cars, so safe.\n\nThe goal is to reach (0,9), which is safe.\n\nNow, to minimize H, the number of turns from t1, so actions from t=13 to t=13+H-1, and at turn t=13+H-1, y=9.\n\nH is the number of actions, so from turn 13 to 13+H-1, that's H turns? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence is for t from t1 to t1+H-1, so at turn t1, we take action a_{t1}, which determines y_{t1+1}, but y_{t1} is given.\n\nAt turn t, we take action a_t, which affects y_{t+1}.\n\nPlayer update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, where Δy_t depends on a_t.\n\nSo at time t, position y_t is known, we choose a_t, then y_{t+1} is set.\n\nCollision at time t depends on y_t and cars at time t.\n\nFor time t, if y_t = k for k=1-8, and there is a car on k such that 0 in span at t, collision.\n\nOtherwise, safe.\n\nAlso, if y_t =0 or 9, no cars, safe.\n\nNow, start at t=13, y=2.\n\nI need to find a sequence of actions a_{13}, a_{14}, ..., up to when y=9.\n\nFirst, let's compute the car positions at various times for each freeway.\n\nSet t1=13, so for turn T, ΔT = T - 13.\n\nFor each freeway, list the cars and when 0 is in their span.\n\nFor a car, 0 in span at T if min_span <= 0 <= max_span.\n\nFor right-moving car, span at T: [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT], so 0 in span if τ + sΔT <= 0 <= h + sΔT.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but all cars here are right-moving, from the table.\n\nIn freeway 1: direction right, freeway 2 to 5 all right, freeway 6 both right, 7 and 8 both right. So all cars are right-moving. No left-moving cars.\n\nSo for all cars, at time T, span: [τ + s(ΔT), h + s(ΔT)] with τ < h.\n\n0 in span if τ + s(ΔT) <= 0 <= h + s(ΔT)\n\nSince τ < h, the inequality must hold.\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need to find for which ΔT, there is a car with 0 in span, meaning that at that time, if player is on that freeway, collision occurs.\n\nFor freeway k, the dangerous times are when for some car on k, τ + sΔT <= 0 <= h + sΔT.\n\nΔT = T - 13.\n\nBut T is the absolute turn, but we care about ΔT.\n\nLet me compute for each freeway the set of ΔT where it is dangerous, i.e., some car covers x=0.\n\nStart with freeway 1: only one car: (h,τ,d,s) = (-27,-38,right,3)\n\nSo τ = -38, h = -27, s=3\n\nSpan at ΔT: [ -38 + 3ΔT, -27 + 3ΔT ]\n\n0 in span if -38 + 3ΔT <= 0 <= -27 + 3ΔT\n\nSolve:\n\n-38 + 3ΔT <= 0 => 3ΔT <= 38 => ΔT <= 38/3 ≈ 12.666, so ΔT <= 12 since ΔT integer? Turns are discrete, I assume ΔT integer.\n\nSimilarly, 0 <= -27 + 3ΔT => 3ΔT >= 27 => ΔT >= 9\n\nSo for ΔT from 9 to 12 inclusive, 0 in span.\n\nΔT >=9 and ΔT <=12, so ΔT=9,10,11,12.\n\nAt ΔT=9: -38 + 27 = -11, -27+27=0, so [ -11, 0], 0 included.\n\nΔT=10: -38+30=-8, -27+30=3, [ -8,3], 0 in.\n\nΔT=11: -38+33=-5, -27+33=6, [-5,6], 0 in.\n\nΔT=12: -38+36=-2, -27+36=9, [-2,9], 0 in.\n\nΔT=13: -38+39=1, -27+39=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo dangerous ΔT: 9,10,11,12\n\nNow freeway 2: one car (12,1,right,12)\n\nh=12, τ=1, s=12\n\nSpan: [1 + 12ΔT, 12 + 12ΔT]\n\n0 in span if 1 + 12ΔT <= 0 <= 12 + 12ΔT\n\n1 + 12ΔT <= 0 => 12ΔT <= -1 => ΔT <= -1/12, impossible since ΔT >=0\n\n0 <= 12 + 12ΔT always true for ΔT>=0.\n\nBut 1 + 12ΔT <= 0 only if ΔT negative, which not possible. So 0 never in span for this car? Because min is 1 +12ΔT >=1 >0 for ΔT>=0, so min span >0, so 0 never covered. Similarly for other similar cars.\n\nτ=1, h=12, s=12, so at ΔT=0, [1,12], min=1>0, so for all ΔT>=0, min >=1>0, so 0 not in span. So freeway 2 is always safe? But there might be cars that cover 0.\n\nFor freeway 2, only this car, so never dangerous.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same car (12,1,right,12), same as above, always min span >=1, so never covers 0.\n\nFreeway 4: same, always safe.\n\nFreeway 5: same, always safe.\n\nNow freeway 6: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (12,1,right,12) same as above, never covers 0.\n\nSecond car: (-36,-47,right,12) h=-36, τ=-47, s=12\n\nSpan: [ -47 + 12ΔT, -36 + 12ΔT ]\n\n0 in span if -47 + 12ΔT <= 0 <= -36 + 12ΔT\n\nFirst: -47 +12ΔT <=0 => 12ΔT <=47 => ΔT <= 47/12 ≈ 3.916, so ΔT <=3\n\nSecond: 0 <= -36 +12ΔT => 12ΔT >=36 => ΔT >=3\n\nSo ΔT >=3 and ΔT <=3, so only at ΔT=3.\n\nAt ΔT=3: -47 + 36 = -11, -36 + 36=0, so [ -11, 0], 0 included.\n\nOther ΔT not.\n\nSo for freeway 6, dangerous only at ΔT=3, because of the second car. First car never dangerous.\n\nNow freeway 7: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (-6,-17,right,6) h=-6, τ=-17, s=6\n\nSpan: [ -17 + 6ΔT, -6 + 6ΔT ]\n\n0 in span if -17 +6ΔT <=0 <= -6 +6ΔT\n\nFirst: -17 +6ΔT <=0 => 6ΔT <=17 => ΔT <= 17/6 ≈2.833, so ΔT <=2\n\nSecond: 0 <= -6 +6ΔT => 6ΔT >=6 => ΔT >=1\n\nSo ΔT >=1 and ΔT <=2, so ΔT=1 or 2.\n\nAt ΔT=1: -17+6=-11, -6+6=0, [-11,0], 0 in.\n\nΔT=2: -17+12=-5, -6+12=6, [-5,6], 0 in.\n\nΔT=0: span [-17,-6], min=-17<0, max=-6<0, so 0 not in.\n\nΔT=3: -17+18=1, -6+18=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car on freeway 7: (42,31,right,6) h=42, τ=31, s=6\n\nSpan: [31 +6ΔT, 42 +6ΔT]\n\nMin at least 31>0, so never covers 0. Always safe.\n\nSo for freeway 7, dangerous at ΔT=1 and ΔT=2 due to first car.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8: same as freeway 7, two cars: (-6,-17,right,6) and (42,31,right,6)\n\nFirst car dangerous at ΔT=1,2; second car safe.\n\nSo freeway 8 dangerous at ΔT=1,2.\n\nNow summarize for each freeway, dangerous times (ΔT):\n\n- y=1: dangerous at ΔT=9,10,11,12\n\n- y=2: always safe (no car covers 0)\n\n- y=3: always safe\n\n- y=4: always safe\n\n- y=5: always safe\n\n- y=6: dangerous at ΔT=3\n\n- y=7: dangerous at ΔT=1,2\n\n- y=8: dangerous at ΔT=1,2\n\nAlso, y=0 and y=9 always safe.\n\nPlayer starts at t=13, y=2, which is safe since y=2 always safe.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\nThe path must avoid being on a dangerous freeway at dangerous times.\n\nSince y must change by ±1 or 0 each turn, I need to move up from 2 to 9.\n\nMinimal steps: if I go up every turn, I can reach y=9 in 7 steps: from y=2 to y=9, difference 7, so actions: U,U,U,U,U,U,U? Let's see.\n\nAt turn t=13, y=2.\n\nAfter a_{13}, y_{14} = y_13 + Δy, depending on a_{13}.\n\nIf I do U at t=13, y_{14} = 3\n\nThen U at t=14, y_{15} = 4\n\n...\n\nAfter 7 U actions: at turn t=13+6=19, y_{19} = 2 + 7 = 9? Let's index.\n\nAt time t, y_t.\n\nt=13: y=2\n\na_t at t affects y_{t+1}\n\nSo:\n\n- At t=13, choose a_{13}, then y_{14} = y_{13} + Δy_{13}\n\n- At t=14, choose a_{14}, y_{15} = y_{14} + Δy_{14}\n\n...\n\n- After H actions, at turn t=13+H-1, we have y_{13+H-1}, and we want this to be 9.\n\nSince we start at t=13, after 0 actions, y_{13}=2.\n\nAfter 1 action, at t=14, y_{14} could be 1,2,3.\n\nAfter k actions, at time t=13+k, position y_{13+k}.\n\nWe want for some k, y_{13+k} =9.\n\nThe minimal k is 7, since from y=2 to y=9, need 7 up moves, but we can stay or go down, but to minimize H, we should go up as much as possible.\n\nH is the number of actions, so if we take actions at t=13 to t=13+H-1, then at time t=13+H, position is set, but we want y_{13+H-1} =9? Let's see the sequence.\n\nThe sequence is {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, so t from 0 to H-1, actions at times t1 + t, for t=0,1,2,...,H-1.\n\nSo actions at: t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\nAfter these actions, the position at time t1+H is y_{t1+H}, but we want to reach (0,9) at some turn, but the goal is to reach (0,9), which I think means that at the end of the sequence, y_{t1+H-1} =9? Let's read.\n\n\"reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H - 1\"\n\nFrom the problem: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} which minimizes H such that y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nYes: after actions from t=t1 to t=t1+H-1, at time t=t1+H-1, y_{t1+H-1} =9.\n\nFor example, if H=1, actions at t1 only, and y_{t1} should be 9, but here y_{t1}=2, not 9, so H>1.\n\nGenerally, at time t=t1, y_{t1} is given, we take actions to change y.\n\nAfter H actions (at times t1 to t1+H-1), at time t=t1+H-1, y=9.\n\nThe position at time t is after the action at t-1, but we care about collision at time t for each t.\n\nIn this case, t1=13, y13=2.\n\nWe want y_{13+H-1} =9.\n\nSet k = H-1, so after k steps, at time t=13+k, y_{13+k}=9.\n\nThe number of actions H, and k = H-1, so y_{t1 + (H-1)} =9.\n\nSince y starts at 2, to reach 9, the minimal k is 7, so minimal H-1=7, thus H=8.\n\nWith k=7 up moves, y_{13+7} = y_{20} =2 +7=9.\n\nActions: at t=13,14,15,16,17,18,19: all U, then at t=20, y=9.\n\nBut t=20 is time, and actions up to t=19.\n\nSequence: actions at t=13 to t=19 (7 actions), then at time t=20, y=9, but we need y at turn t_{t1 + H -1} to be 9.\n\nt_{t1 + H -1} = t_{13 + H -1}\n\nFor H=8, t_{13+8-1}=t_{20}, y_{20}=9.\n\nWith 7 actions: if I take 7 U actions at t=13 to 19, then:\n\n- After a13 U, y14=3\n\n- a14 U, y15=4\n\n- a15 U, y16=5\n\n- a16 U, y17=6\n\n- a17 U, y18=7\n\n- a18 U, y19=8\n\n- a19 U, y20=9\n\nSo at time t=20, y=9, which is t_{13 +7}, but H-1=7? H is number of actions.\n\nWith 7 actions, at times t=13 to 19, H=7, then t_{t1 + H -1} = t_{13+7-1}=t_{19}, and at t=19, y=8, not 9.\n\nMistake.\n\nWe want y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nt1=13, so y_{13 + H -1} =9.\n\nAt time 13+H-1, y=9.\n\nAfter H actions, we have y at time 13+H-1.\n\nStart: at time 13, y=2.\n\nAfter first action (at t=13), y14 = y13 + Δy13\n\nAfter second action (at t=14), y15 = y14 + Δy14\n\n...\n\nAfter H-th action (at t=13+H-1), y_{13+H} = y_{13+H-1} + Δy_{13+H-1}\n\nBut we care about y at time 13+H-1.\n\nFor the position to be 9 at time 13+H-1.\n\nThe change: from time 13 to time 13+H-1, there are (H-1) actions affecting the position.\n\nThe net displacement must be +7 to go from 2 to 9.\n\nEach action changes y by -1,0, or +1.\n\nSo minimal number of actions to achieve net +7 with moves U,D,S.\n\nSince we can only change by 1 each step, the minimal number of turns to go from 2 to 9 is 7, but that requires 7 U actions, and after 7 actions, y at time 13+7 =20 would be 9, but we want y at time 13+H-1 to be 9.\n\nSet T = t1 + H -1 =13 + H -1\n\nAt time T, y_T=9.\n\nFrom time 13 to time T, there are (T - 13) steps, and the position changes from y13 to yT.\n\nThe number of actions between time 13 and T is (T - 13).\n\nAt each action, we can change y.\n\nAfter (T-13) actions, we go from y13 to yT.\n\nTo go from 2 to 9, net +7, so we need at least 7 actions, all U, with T-13=7, so T=20, and actions at t=13 to 19, all U, then y20=9.\n\nBut at time T=20, y=9.\n\nBut in terms of H: we have actions from t=13 to t=19, that's 7 actions, so H=7, and t_{t1 + H -1} = t_{13+7-1}=t_{19}, but at t=19, y=8, not 9.\n\nContradiction.\n\nI think I confused the indexing.\n\nLet me define the time.\n\nAt time t, the state is fixed, including y_t and car positions.\n\nAt time t, we choose action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nFor collision, at time t, we check if player on freeway y_t and if cars on that freeway cover x=0 at t.\n\nThen, after choosing a_t, we move to time t+1 with y_{t+1}.\n\nThe sequence: we start at time t1=13, with y13=2.\n\nWe choose a sequence of actions a_{13}, a_{14}, ..., a_{13+H-1} for H actions.\n\nAfter these actions, at time t=13+H, y_{13+H} is set, but we don't care directly.\n\nWe want that at time t=13+H-1, y_{13+H-1} =9.\n\nFor example, to have y at some time be 9, with minimal H.\n\nFrom time 13 to time T, the number of actions taken is (T - 13), from t=13 to t=T-1.\n\nIf we take actions at t=13 to t=T-1, then at time T, y_T is determined.\n\nWe want y_T =9 for some T.\n\nWith T-13 actions, we can reach y_T from y13 with net change.\n\nMinimal T-13 is 7, with T=20, actions at t=13 to 19 all U, y20=9.\n\nThen at time T=20, y=9.\n\nNow, H is the number of actions, from t=13 to t=13+H-1.\n\nFor T=20, we need actions at t=13 to 19, which is 7 actions, so H=7, and t_{t1 + H -1} = t_{13+7-1} =t_{19}, but at t=19, y=8, not 9.\n\nThe condition is y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nWith H=7, t1+H-1=13+6=19, y19=8 if we did U at t=18.\n\nLet's list:\n\nTime t: y_t, action a_t\n\nt=13: y=2, choose a13\n\nt=14: y= y13 + Δy13, based on a13\n\nThen at t=14, choose a14, and so on.\n\nAt time t, we have y_t, then we choose a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nFor collision at time t, it depends on y_t and cars at t.\n\nAfter choosing a_t, we go to t+1.\n\nTo have y at time T be 9, we need to have taken actions from t=13 to t=T-1.\n\nThe position at time T is y_T.\n\nWe want y_T =9 for T = t1 + H -1 =13 + H -1.\n\nFor a given T, the number of actions to reach it from t=13 is (T - 13), actions at t=13 to t=T-1.\n\nThen H = number of actions = T - 13.\n\nThen T = t1 + H -1 =13 + H -1.\n\nBut H = T - 13, so T = 13 + (T -13) -1 = T -1, which is inconsistent unless 0= -1, impossible.\n\nMistake.\n\nFrom H = number of actions = T - 13\n\nAnd T = t1 + H -1 =13 + H -1\n\nSo from first, H = T -13\n\nPlug into second: T = 13 + (T-13) -1 = T -1, so T = T-1, contradiction.\n\nSo the indexing must be different.\n\nLet's read the problem carefully.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9), avoiding collisions\"\n\n\"such that y_{t1 + H - 1} =9\"\n\nAnd \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" so for t from 0 to H-1, actions at times t1 + t.\n\nSo for t=0, action at t1, t=1, action at t1+1, ..., t=H-1, action at t1+H-1.\n\nAfter these actions, the position at time (t1 + H) is set, but we care about position at time t1 + H -1.\n\nAt time t1 + H -1, we have position y_{t1+H-1}, and we want this to be 9.\n\nFor that to happen, the actions from t1 to t1+H-2 affect y up to time t1+H-1.\n\nLet's think of the state at time τ.\n\nAt time τ, y_τ is position.\n\nTo change from y13 to yτ, we need actions from time 13 to τ-1, that's (τ - 13) actions.\n\nThen at time τ, yτ is set.\n\nWe want yτ =9 for τ = t1 + H -1 =13 + H -1.\n\nNumber of actions to reach time τ is (τ - 13).\n\nBut the actions are from t=13 to t=τ-1, number is (τ-1) - 13 +1 = τ -13.\n\nH is the number of actions in the sequence, which is for times t1 to t1+H-1, so to have actions up to time τ-1, we need the last action at τ-1, so t1+H-1 = τ-1.\n\nThen y at time τ is determined.\n\nWe want yτ =9.\n\nFrom t1+H-1 = τ-1, so τ = t1+H-1 +1 = t1+H\n\nThen y_{t1+H} =9\n\nBut the condition is y_{t1+H-1} =9.\n\nConfusion.\n\nLet's set τ = t1 + H -1\n\nWe want y_τ =9.\n\nTo have y_τ =9, we need to have taken actions from time t1 to τ-1.\n\nNumber of actions: from t1 to τ-1 inclusive, that's (τ-1) - t1 +1 = τ - t1.\n\nSince τ = t1 + H -1, so number of actions H = τ - t1.\n\nBut τ = t1 + H -1, so H = (t1 + H -1) - t1 = H -1, so H = H-1, impossible.\n\nI think there's a fundamental issue with the indexing.\n\nPerhaps the actions include the move to reach the position at that time.\n\nLet's look for a small example.\n\nSuppose at t1, y=8, then to reach y=9, I can do U at t1, then at time t1+1, y=9.\n\nSo H should be 1, action at t1, and y at time t1 + H -1 = t1 +1-1 =t1, but y at t1 is 8, not 9.\n\nWith H=1, actions at t1, then y at time t1 + H -1 = t1 +0 =t1, which is 8, not 9.\n\nBut after action U at t1, at time t1+1, y=9.\n\nTo have y at time t1+1 be 9, we need H such that t1 + H -1 = t1+1, so H-1=1, H=2.\n\nActions for t=0 to H-1=1, so actions at t1 and t1+1.\n\nBut at t1+1, we choose a_{t1+1}, which affects y_{t1+2}, but we want y at t1+1.\n\nI think it's messy.\n\nPerhaps the position at time t is before the action.\n\nBut in the problem, at turn t, we choose action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nCollision at turn T depends on y_T.\n\nTo have y_T =9, we need to have arrived at that position by actions before.\n\nFor T = t1 + H -1, we want y_T =9.\n\nWith the actions from t1 to T-1, we can set y_T.\n\nNumber of actions: from t1 to T-1, that's (T-1) - t1 +1 = T - t1 actions.\n\nH is the number of actions, so H = T - t1.\n\nThen T = t1 + H, but we have T = t1 + H -1, so t1 + H -1 = t1 + H, impossible.\n\nThe only way is that the action at time T is not needed for y_T, but for the next.\n\nI think I need to accept the definition as is.\n\nPerhaps for the sequence, when we take action at t, it is for the move to position at t+1.\n\nBut for the final position at t1+H-1, it is set by action at t1+H-2.\n\nLet's assume that at time t, y_t is the position, and we choose a_t to determine y_{t+1}.\n\nThen for the sequence, actions from t1 to t1+H-1 determine y from t1+1 to t1+H.\n\nWe want y at time t1+H-1 to be 9.\n\nWith actions from t1 to t1+H-2, we determine y up to t1+H-1.\n\nActions at t1 to t1+H-2 affect y_{t1+1} to y_{t1+H-1}.\n\nNumber of actions: from t1 to t1+H-2, that's (H-1) actions.\n\nThen y at t1+H-1 is determined.\n\nWe want this to be 9.\n\nH is the number of actions in the sequence, from t1 to t1+H-1, so for the position at t1+H-1, it is determined by actions up to t1+H-2.\n\nSo the sequence includes action at t1+H-1, which affects y_{t1+H}, but we don't care about that for the position at t1+H-1.\n\nTo have y_{t1+H-1} =9, we need actions from t1 to t1+H-2 to move from y13 to y_{t1+H-1} =9.\n\nFrom time 13 to time t1+H-1, the number of steps is (t1+H-1) - 13.\n\ny changes from y13 to y_{t1+H-1} with net change.\n\nMinimal when we go directly up.\n\nLet K = t1+H-1 - 13 = H-1 + t1 -13, t1=13, so K = H-1.\n\nThen from time 13 to time 13+K, there are K actions from t=13 to t=12+K? Let's set T = t1+H-1 =13 + H -1\n\nWe want y_T =9.\n\nFrom time 13 to time T, there are (T - 13) actions, from t=13 to t=T-1, that affect the position from y14 to yT.\n\ny13 is given, so to change to yT, it takes (T-13) actions.\n\nWith those actions, we go from y13 to yT.\n\nNet change yT - y13.\n\nHere y13=2, yT=9, net +7, so minimal T-13 =7, with all U actions at t=13 to 19, then y20=9, so T=20.\n\nThen T-13=7, so 7 actions.\n\nBut T = t1+H-1 =13+H-1\n\nSo 13+H-1 =20, so H-1=7, H=8.\n\nThen actions from t=13 to t=13+8-1=20? t1+H-1=13+8-1=20, but actions at times t1 to t1+H-1=13 to 20.\n\nBut for y at T=20, it is determined by actions up to t=19.\n\nWith actions at t=13 to 19 (7 actions), y20=9.\n\nWith H=8, actions at t=13 to 20, but action at t=20 affects y21, which is not needed.\n\nFor y at t=20 to be 9, we need actions from t=13 to 19, 7 actions.\n\nThen with H=7, actions at t=13 to 19, then y at t1+H-1=13+7-1=19 is y19, which is 8 if we did U at t=18.\n\nTo have y19=9, we need to be at 9 at time 19.\n\nFrom y13=2, to y19=9, net +7 in 6 steps? From time 13 to 19, there are 6 actions: t=13 to 18, affecting y14 to y19.\n\ny at time 19 is affected by action at t=18.\n\nTo go from y13=2 to y19=9, net +7, with 6 actions, so we need to gain 7 in 6 steps, which requires at least one stay or something, but each action changes by at most 1, so from time 13 to time 19, the values are y13, y14, y15, y16, y17, y18, y19, that's 7 positions, from index 13 to 19 inclusive is 7 times.\n\nThe change: from y13 to y14 is one action, to y15 another, up to y19 from y18 by action at t=18.\n\nSo to go from y13 to y19, there are 6 actions (t=13 to 18), resulting in 6 changes, so y19 = y13 + sum of Δy from t=13 to 18.\n\nTo have y19=9, y13=2, so sum Δy = +7, with 6 actions, each Δy = -1,0,1, so impossible to have sum +7 in 6 actions; maximum gain is +6 with 6 U.\n\nSo y19 can be at most 8.\n\nSimilarly, to have y at time T be 9, T must be at least 20, with y20=9 after 7 U actions from t=13 to 19.\n\nBut for T=20, y20=9, then t1+H-1=20, so 13+H-1=20, H-1=7, H=8.\n\nThen actions at t=13 to t=13+8-1=20.\n\nAction at t=20 is not needed for y20, but it is included in the sequence.\n\nPerhaps we can choose S or something for the extra action, but it's wasteful.\n\nTo reach y=9 at time T=20, we need actions from t=13 to 19, 7 actions.\n\nWith H=8, we have an extra action at t=20, which can be S, for example, but then y21 might be 9 or something, but we only care about y at t=20.\n\nBut the sequence includes a20, which is not necessary.\n\nMinimal H should be 7 for T=20.\n\nBut with H=7, t1+H-1=13+6=19, y19=8 if we go up.\n\nSo to have y at t1+H-1=9, we need to be at 9 at that time, so for H=7, t=19, y19=8, not 9.\n\nFor H=8, t=13+7=20, y20=9 possible.\n\nWith H=8, actions at t=13 to 20, and we can have y20=9 with actions U at t=13 to 19, and at t=20, we can choose S, so y21=9, but we don't care.\n\nBut for the position at t=20, it is 9, set by action at t=19.\n\nAction at t=20 doesn't affect y20.\n\nSo in the sequence, for H=8, actions at t=13 to 20, but to have y20=9, we only need actions up to t=19.\n\nThe action at t=20 is redundant for reaching y at t=20.\n\nBut the problem asks for a sequence to reach at turn t1+H-1, so for H=8, t1+H-1=20, and we can have y20=9.\n\nSimilarly, for the collision, we need to ensure that at each time from t=13 to t=20, when on freeway 1-8, no collision.\n\nWith the actions, we control y at each time.\n\nFor minimal H, since we must reach y=9, and from y=2, the earliest time to be at y=9 is t=20 with 7 up moves, so H must be at least 8, with t1+H-1=20.\n\nH=8, t1+H-1=13+7=20.\n\nYes.\n\nWith H=7, t1+H-1=19, y19 can be at most 8, so cannot be 9.\n\nSo minimal H is 8, with y at t=20=9.\n\nActions from t=13 to t=20, but action at t=20 is not needed, but we can include it.\n\nPerhaps we can reach earlier by going faster, but we can only move one step per turn, so no, min time to y=9 is t=20.\n\ny starts at 2 at t=13, after k up moves, at time t=13+k, y=2+k.\n\nSet 2+k=9, k=7, so at time t=13+7=20, y=9.\n\nSo t=20 is the earliest possible.\n\nThus for the sequence, H must be such that t1+H-1=20, so 13+H-1=20, H-1=7, H=8.\n\nActions at times t=13 to t=20.\n\nBut to have y20=9, we need actions at t=13 to 19 to be U, and action at t=20 can be S or U or D, but since y=9, if we do U, y21=10, but y must be in 0-9, so probably not allowed, or it wraps, but the update says y_{t+1} in [0,9], so if at 9 and U, it might stay or error, but the rule says y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t with y_{t+1} in [0,9], so at y=9, U would cause y=10 not allowed, so probably it clamps or something, but to be safe, at y=9, we should do S or D, but since we want to be at 9, S is fine.\n\nBut in this case, for action at t=20, we can do S to stay at 9.\n\nBut for the position at t=20, it is already 9 before the action.\n\nThe action at t=20 affects y21, not y20.\n\nSo for the sequence, to reach y at t=20=9, we need actions that bring us to y=9 at t=20, which requires actions at t=13 to 19 all U, and action at t=20 is separate.\n\nBut in the sequence for H=8, we include a20, which can be chosen arbitrarily, as long as no collision, but at t=20, y20=9, no cars, safe.\n\nSo it's fine.\n\nNow back to the car avoidance.\n\nPlayer starts at t=13, y=2.\n\nWe want to go to y=9 by t=20.\n\nWith actions: ideally all U from t=13 to 19, but we need to check for each time t from 13 to 20, the position y_t, and if on freeway 1-8, whether collision occurs based on cars at t.\n\ny_t for t=13 to 20.\n\nWith all U:\n\nt=13: y=2\n\nt=14: y=3 (after U at t=13)\n\nt=15: y=4\n\nt=16: y=5\n\nt=17: y=6\n\nt=18: y=7\n\nt=19: y=8\n\nt=20: y=9\n\nNow, check collision at each t:\n\nFirst, t=13: y=2, freeway 2.\n\nFreeway 2: always safe, as we saw earlier, no car covers 0 at any time. So safe.\n\nt=14: y=3, freeway 3. Always safe, no issue.\n\nt=15: y=4, freeway 4. Always safe.\n\nt=16: y=5, freeway 5. Always safe.\n\nt=17: y=6, freeway 6.\n\nFreeway 6 dangerous at ΔT=3.\n\nΔT = T - 13, so for T=17, ΔT=4.\n\nDangerous at ΔT=3, which is T=16.\n\nFor T=17, ΔT=4, not dangerous, so safe.\n\nt=18: y=7, freeway 7.\n\nFreeway 7 dangerous at ΔT=1 and 2.\n\nΔT=1: T=14\n\nΔT=2: T=15\n\nFor T=18, ΔT=5, not 1 or 2, so safe.\n\nt=19: y=8, freeway 8.\n\nDangerous at ΔT=1 and 2, T=14 and 15.\n\nT=19, ΔT=6, safe.\n\nt=20: y=9, no freeway, safe.\n\nSo in this path, all positions are safe, no collision.\n\nt=13: y=2 safe\n\nt=14: y=3 safe\n\nt=15: y=4 safe\n\nt=16: y=5 safe\n\nt=17: y=6, at T=17, ΔT=4, freeway 6 dangerous only at ΔT=3, T=16, not T=17, safe.\n\nt=18: y=7, freeway 7 dangerous at T=14,15, not 18, safe.\n\nt=19: y=8, freeway 8 dangerous at T=14,15, not 19, safe.\n\nt=20: safe.\n\nSo with all U actions, we can reach y=9 at t=20 safely.\n\nThen actions: for H=8, actions at t=13 to 20.\n\nAt t=13 to 19: U\n\nAt t=20: since y=9, we need to choose an action, but S is fine, to stay.\n\nNow, the sequence should be:\n\nTurn t1: a_{13} = U\n\nTurn t1+1: a_{14} = U\n\n...\n\nUp to turn t1+6: a_{19} = U\n\nThen turn t1+7: a_{20} = S or something.\n\nt from 0 to H-1=7 for H=8.\n\nAction at t1 + t for t=0 to 7.\n\nt=0: t1+0=13, a13=U\n\nt=1: t1+1=14, a14=U\n\nt=2: 15, U\n\nt=3: 16, U\n\nt=4: 17, U\n\nt=5: 18, U\n\nt=6: 19, U\n\nt=7: 20, a20=?\n\nAt t=20, we choose a20, which affects y21, but since we only care up to y20=9, and no further, we can choose S to stay.\n\nIn the answer, we need to specify the actions.\n\nBut in this case, with all U except last action S, but last action is at t=20, which is after we reached y=9 at t=20.\n\nBut since the sequence includes it, we have to.\n\nMinimal H is 8, and it works with no issue.\n\nBut is there a way with smaller H? H=7 would require y at t=19=9, but from y=2 to y=19, with actions from t=13 to 18, 6 actions, max y=8, cannot be 9, so impossible. So H=8 is minimal.\n\nNow, in this sequence, all is fine, but let's confirm the car positions at the times we are on the freeways.\n\nFor example, at t=17, y=6, freeway 6.\n\nΔT = T-13=17-13=4\n\nFreeway 6 dangerous only at ΔT=3, which is t=16.\n\nAt t=16, we were on y=5, not on freeway 6.\n\nAt t=17, y=6, ΔT=4, cars: first car [1+12*4,12+12*4]=[1+48,12+48]=[49,60] not cover 0.\n\nSecond car: [-47+12*4, -36+12*4]=[-47+48, -36+48]=[1,12], min=1>0, not cover 0. So safe.\n\nAt t=18, y=7, ΔT=5\n\nFreeway 7: cars, first car [-17+6*5, -6+6*5]=[-17+30, -6+30]=[13,24] not cover 0.\n\nSecond car [31+30,42+30]=[61,72] no.\n\nDangerous at ΔT=1,2: t=14,15.\n\nAt t=14, we were on y=3, not 7.\n\nSimilarly, t=18 safe.\n\nSame for t=19, y=8, ΔT=6, freeway 8 cars: [-17+36, -6+36]=[19,30] and [31+36,42+36]=[67,78], no issue.\n\nSo all good.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is all U from t=13 to 19, and S at t=20.\n\nBut t=20 action is part of the sequence.\n\nIn the answer, we need to list for each turn.\n\nNow, the current turn is t1=13.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nTurn 20: S  (or we can do U, but at y=9, U might not be allowed, so S is safe)\n\nThe update rule says y_{t+1} in [0,9], so if at y=9 and U, it should stay or clamp to 9, but to avoid issue, S is fine.\n\nNow, for the sequence, since we reach at turn 20, and action at 20 is specified.\n\nBut in the sequence, for t=20, we do S, but it doesn't affect the position at t=20.\n\nBut it's required for the action sequence of H=8.\n\nPerhaps we can do fewer actions, but H=8 is minimal.\n\nAnother thing: in the beginning, at t=13, we are at y=2, and we do U to go to y=3 at t=14.\n\nBut at t=13, we are on freeway 2, which is safe, as we saw.\n\nIn the car state, freeway 2 has a car at [1,12] at t=13, but min=1>0, so not cover 0, safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think this works.\n\nBut the problem is to output the sequence.\n\nIn the answer format.\n\nAlso, we need to box the answer.\n\nBut is there any reason to not go directly? For example, if at some point we need to wait.\n\nBut in this case, no, all safe.\n\nPerhaps at some turn, if we were on a dangerous freeway at dangerous time, but here we avoided.\n\nFor example, freeway 6 is dangerous at t=16 (ΔT=3), but at t=16, we are on y=5, not on freeway 6.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 7 dangerous at t=14 and 15: at t=14, we are on y=3, not 7; t=15, y=4, not 7.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=8, with sequence all U except last S.\n\nBut the sequence has 8 actions: 7 U and one S.\n\nSpecifically: a13 to a19: U, a20: S.\n\nNow, in the turn: from turn 13 to turn 20.\n\nAnswer:\n\n\\boxed{ Turn 13: U \\\\ Turn 14: U \\\\ Turn 15: U \\\\ Turn 16: U \\\\ Turn 17: U \\\\ Turn 18: U \\\\ Turn 19: U \\\\ Turn 20: S }\n\nBut turn 20 is t1 + 7, since t=0 to 7.\n\nt1=13, turn t1:13, t1+1:14, ..., t1+7:20.\n\nYes.\n\nTo be precise.\n\nSince the player might need to go down or wait, but here not necessary.\n\nAnother thing: in freeway 6, at t=16, dangerous, but we are not there.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nSo I think this is the answer.\n</think>\nTo reach the position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 2)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 13\\) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the sequence of actions must be determined based on the car dynamics and collision rules.\n\n### Analysis\n- The player starts at \\(y = 2\\) at turn \\(13\\).\n- To reach \\(y = 9\\), a net increase of \\(+7\\) in the \\(y\\)-coordinate is required.\n- Each action \\(a_t \\in \\{U, D, S\\}\\) changes \\(y\\) by \\(+1\\), \\(-1\\), or \\(0\\) respectively, with \\(y\\) constrained to \\([0, 9]\\).\n- The minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to achieve \\(y = 9\\) at turn \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 13 + H - 1\\) is determined by the earliest possible arrival time.

We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on the freeways (y=1 to 8).\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if the player is on a freeway k (i.e., y_T = k) and at that turn T, for any car on that freeway k, the x=0 is within the car's span at turn T.\n\nNote: The player's movement:\n  - At turn t, the player is at (0, y_t).\n  - They choose an action a_t (U: up, D: down, S: stay) which affects the next y: \n        y_{t+1} = y_t + { +1 for U, -1 for D, 0 for S } (clamped to [0,9])\n\nImportant: When moving from y_t to y_{t+1} at turn t, the player is only considered to be on freeway y_t at turn t. So when moving from y_t to y_{t+1} (which happens at the end of turn t), at the moment of turn t, the player is still on row y_t. Therefore, we only check the freeway y_t at turn t for collision.\n\nThus, for each turn T (starting from t1=14), we have:\n  - The player is at (0, y_T) at turn T. We must avoid collision on freeway y_T at turn T.\n\nWe are to find the minimal H (number of turns) and a sequence of actions from turn 14 to turn 14+H-1 such that at the last turn (turn 14+H-1) the player is at y=9.\n\nWe start at y=3 at turn 14.\n\nWe must avoid the freeways 1 to 8 when we are on them at the corresponding turn.\n\nLet's list the cars on each freeway at turn 14 (current state) and then we can compute their positions at any future turn T (relative to t0=14, so T = 14, 15, ...).\n\nNote: The car update rules:\n  - For a left-moving car: at turn T, the span is [h - s*(T-t0), τ - s*(T-t0)] \n    But note: the description says for left-moving: initially at t0: span [h, τ] and then becomes [h - s*(T-t0), τ - s*(T-t0)].\n    However, note that in the table, the direction is given as \"right\" or left? The table only has \"right\" in the given data.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nFreeway 1: (-24, -35, right, 3) -> but note: the representation for right-moving cars is given as (head, tail, direction, speed). \n  For right-moving, the update rule: [τ + s*(T-t0), h + s*(T-t0)]? \n  Actually, the rule says:\n    Right-moving: [τ + s*(T-t0), h + s*(T-t0)]\n\nBut wait, the initial state at t0 is given as (head, tail). How is the span defined?\n\nFor a right-moving car, the head is the front (leading part) and the tail is the back. As the car moves right, both head and tail increase.\n\nIn the update rule for right-moving: \n  Initially: [τ, h] at t0? But the table gives (head, tail) = (h, τ). \n\nActually, the problem says for right-moving: \n  \"Span(t1) = [τ, h] -> becomes [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\"\n\nBut in the table, the car is given as (head, tail, direction, speed). \n\nSo for a right-moving car, the head is the front (so the larger x) and the tail is the rear (smaller x). Therefore, the initial span at t0 is [tail, head] = [τ, h]. \n\nExample: Freeway 1: head=-24, tail=-35 -> so the car spans from x=-35 (tail) to x=-24 (head). Then at time T, the car will be at:\n  [ -35 + 3*(T-14), -24 + 3*(T-14) ]\n\nSimilarly, for a left-moving car, the head would be the front (which is the larger x) and tail the rear (smaller x), but then the update subtracts. However, we don't have any left-moving cars in this problem.\n\nSo let me restate the car positions at time T (T>=14) for each car:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (head=-24, tail=-35, right, s=3)\n  At time T: tail_T = -35 + 3*(T-14)\n            head_T = -24 + 3*(T-14)\n\nFreeway 2: one car: (head=24, tail=13, right, s=12)\n  At time T: tail_T = 13 + 12*(T-14)\n            head_T = 24 + 12*(T-14)\n\nFreeway 3: same as freeway 2? head=24, tail=13, right, s=12 -> same car? Actually, it's a different freeway. So same parameters.\n\nFreeway 4: same.\n\nFreeway 5: same.\n\nFreeway 6: two cars: \n  car1: (24,13,right,12) -> same as above\n  car2: (-24,-35,right,12) -> wait, note: head=-24, tail=-35, but moving right? Then at T:\n        tail_T = -35 + 12*(T-14)\n        head_T = -24 + 12*(T-14)\n\nFreeway 7: two cars:\n  car1: (0, -11, right, 6) -> at T: tail_T = -11 + 6*(T-14), head_T = 0 + 6*(T-14)\n  car2: (48,37,right,6) -> at T: tail_T = 37 + 6*(T-14), head_T = 48 + 6*(T-14)\n\nFreeway 8: same as freeway 7.\n\nWe are only concerned with when the player is on a freeway k at turn T, we check if x=0 is in the span of any car on freeway k at turn T.\n\nOur plan: We are going to simulate the player's movement from y=3 at turn 14, and we want to reach y=9 as quickly as possible, avoiding collisions.\n\nWe note that the player can only change row by one per turn (or stay). We are starting at row 3 and need to get to row 9, so at least 6 moves (if we go up every turn). However, we might have to wait (or even go down) to avoid cars.\n\nWe'll consider a BFS (breadth-first search) over states (turn, y) because we want the minimal H (turns). The state is (t, y) where t is the current turn (starting at 14) and y is the current row.\n\nWe simulate from turn 14 onward.\n\nBut note: the turn number increases, and we are only concerned with the relative time.\n\nWe must check for each state (t, y) whether being at row y at turn t is safe.\n\nHow to check safety at (t, y):\n  - If y=0 or y=9, there are no cars (freeways are 1..8) -> safe.\n  - If y is between 1 and 8, then we look at freeway y and check all cars on that freeway at turn t.\n\n    For each car on freeway y:\n        if the car is right-moving: \n            let tail_t = initial_tail + s*(t-14)\n            let head_t = initial_head + s*(t-14)\n            then the span is [tail_t, head_t] (since tail_t <= head_t for right-moving)\n        if left-moving: [head - s*(t-14), tail - s*(t-14)]? But note the representation: for left-moving, the head is the front (at a higher x) and tail at lower? Actually, the problem states for left-moving: \n            initial span [h, τ] -> becomes [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]\n            so the span is [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)] and note that h is the head (so at the right) and τ the tail (left) so h>τ. Then the span is [τ - s*(T-t1), h - s*(T-t1)]? Actually, no: because h is the head (which is the front, so larger x) and τ is the tail (smaller x). But when moving left, the entire car moves left, so the head becomes h - s*(T-t1) and the tail becomes τ - s*(T-t1). And since h>τ, then h - s*(T-t1) > τ - s*(T-t1). So the span is [τ - s*(T-t1), h - s*(T-t1)]? Actually, the problem says the span becomes [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]? \n\n        Let me clarify: \n            \"Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] -> Span(T) = [h - s (T-t1), τ - s (T-t1)]\"\n            But note: if at t1, the car is from τ to h (with h>τ) and then at T, it moves left: so the head (which was at h) moves to h - s*(T-t1) and the tail (which was at τ) moves to τ - s*(T-t1). Since h>τ, then h-s*(T-t1) > τ-s*(T-t1). So the span is [τ - s*(T-t1), h - s*(T-t1)]? \n\n        However, the problem writes: [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)] and then we have to note that h - s*(T-t1) is actually the rightmost point? But in the notation [a, b] with a<=b? \n\n        Actually, the problem states the span as an interval. For the left-moving car at t1, the span is [h, τ]? That would imply h <= τ? But that contradicts if h is the head and τ the tail? \n\n        Let me re-read: \n          \"Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] -> Span(T) = [h - s (T-t1), τ - s (T-t1)]\"\n\n        This notation [h, τ] is ambiguous. But note: in the right-moving case, they write: \n          \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\" \n\n        So for right-moving, they write the tail first and then the head (so the interval is [tail, head]). \n\n        Similarly, for left-moving, they write [h, τ]? But then if the car is from τ to h (with τ < h), then [h, τ] would be backwards? \n\n        This is confusing. However, looking at the example data: we have no left-moving cars. So we can skip.\n\n        But for consistency, note that for a car moving right, the initial span is [tail, head] (with tail <= head). For a left-moving car, the initial span is [head, tail]? That would be [larger, smaller]? That doesn't make sense as an interval.\n\n        Alternatively, perhaps the problem always writes the interval in increasing order? \n\n        Actually, the problem says for left-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, τ]\" and then moves to [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]. If the car is moving left, then the entire car shifts left, so both endpoints decrease. But the interval representation should be [min, max]. \n\n        How about we interpret the span as the set of x-coordinates covered, and we require that 0 is in [min, max] of the span.\n\n        Therefore, for a left-moving car, the span at T is [min, max] = [min(h, τ) - s*(T-t1), max(h, τ) - s*(T-t1)]? \n\n        But the problem writes: [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]. This is an interval that might be decreasing? \n\n        Actually, the problem does not specify the order of the endpoints. Instead, we should check if 0 is between the two endpoints (without assuming which is smaller). \n\n        However, the collision condition is: \"0 in Span(T)\". So if the span is defined as the set of points from the tail to the head, then regardless of the direction, the span is the interval [min(initial_tail, initial_head), max(initial_tail, initial_head)] shifted appropriately.\n\n        But note: the update rule for left-moving subtracts s*(T-t1) from both endpoints. So the relative order of the endpoints remains the same. \n\n        Therefore, for a car (whether left or right) we can compute:\n          endpoint1 = h - (if left) or h + (if right) ? Actually, no: the update is different.\n\n        Instead, let's define:\n\n          For a right-moving car: \n             tail_t = initial_tail + s*(T-14)\n             head_t = initial_head + s*(T-14)\n             and the span is [min(tail_t, head_t), max(tail_t, head_t)]? But note: in the initial state, the tail is the leftmost and head the rightmost, so tail_t <= head_t. And as the car moves right, tail_t and head_t both increase, but tail_t remains <= head_t.\n\n          For a left-moving car:\n             tail_t = initial_tail - s*(T-14)\n             head_t = initial_head - s*(T-14)\n             and the span is [min(tail_t, head_t), max(tail_t, head_t)]? But note: in the initial state, the head is the rightmost and tail the leftmost? Actually, the problem says for left-moving: the head is the front? So when moving left, the head is still the rightmost? Then at any time, head_t >= tail_t.\n\n        Actually, the problem states the initial span for left-moving as [h, τ]? and then becomes [h - s*(T-14), τ - s*(T-14)]. If h is the head (rightmost) and τ the tail (leftmost), then h>=τ. Then the interval [h - s*(T-14), τ - s*(T-14)] is actually [a, b] with a>=b? That doesn't make sense for an interval.\n\n        This is a problem in the problem statement. However, since we don't have any left-moving cars, we can ignore.\n\n        But note: freeway 6 has a car (-24, -35, right, 12): this is right-moving, so we use the right-moving update.\n\n        So for every car in our data, they are right-moving. Therefore, we can simply compute:\n\n          For a car (head, tail, direction, speed) that is right-moving:\n             at turn T: \n                 tail_T = tail + speed*(T-14)\n                 head_T = head + speed*(T-14)\n          and the span is [tail_T, head_T] (since tail_T <= head_T because the car is moving right and initially tail<=head?).\n\n        But wait: freeway 1: head=-24, tail=-35 -> so tail=-35, head=-24 -> tail<=head? yes, -35<=-24.\n\n        Similarly, freeway 2: head=24, tail=13 -> 13<=24 -> true.\n\n        Freeway 6: first car: (24,13) -> 13<=24; second car: (-24,-35) -> -35<=-24 -> true.\n\n        Freeway 7: first car: (0,-11) -> -11<=0 -> true; second car: (48,37) -> 37<=48 -> true.\n\n        So for every car, tail <= head? Yes.\n\n        Therefore, the span at T is [tail + s*(T-14), head + s*(T-14)].\n\n        Collision occurs at (t, y) if y is between 1 and 8 and there exists a car on freeway y such that:\n            tail + s*(t-14) <= 0 <= head + s*(t-14)\n\nNow we can precompute for each freeway (1..8) and for each car on that freeway, the time intervals (if any) when 0 is in the car's span.\n\nBut note: we are going to simulate from t=14 onward. We can compute for a given (t, y) whether it is safe.\n\nWe'll do:\n\n  For state (t, y):\n      if y==0 or y==9: safe.\n      else (y in [1,8]): \n          for each car on freeway y (from the table at turn 14):\n              let tail_T = tail + s*(t-14)\n              let head_T = head + s*(t-14)\n              if tail_T <= 0 <= head_T -> collision -> unsafe.\n          if no car on freeway y causes collision -> safe.\n\nBut note: a freeway might have multiple cars. We need to avoid any collision with any car.\n\nNow, we want the minimal H such that we can get from (14,3) to (t,9) for some t>=14, and the path is safe.\n\nWe'll use BFS (by time). The state: (t, y) where t is the current turn and y is the current row.\n\nActions: U, D, S -> leads to (t+1, y+1), (t+1, y-1), (t+1, y) respectively, but clamped to [0,9].\n\nWe start at (14,3). We want to reach any state (t,9) with minimal t (so minimal H = t - 14 + 1? Actually, the last action is at turn t, and then we are at (t,9). The number of turns H = t - 14? \n\nWait: we start at turn 14 (which is the first turn we take an action). We are to provide a sequence of actions for turns: 14, 15, ... until the turn when we reach 9.\n\nThe problem says: sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} meaning:\n   t=0: a_{14} (turn14)\n   t=1: a_{15}\n   ...\n   t=H-1: a_{14+H-1}\n\nAnd at the end of the last action (turn 14+H-1) we are at 9.\n\nSo the number of actions is H, and the state at the beginning of turn 14 is (0,3). Then we take action a_14 and move to (0, y_{15})? \n\nWait, the update: \n   y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, where Δy_t is determined by a_t.\n\nSo at turn 14:\n   we are at y_14 = 3.\n   we choose a_14 -> then y_15 = 3 + Δy_14.\n\nSo after H actions (at turn 14+H), we are at y_{14+H}. We require y_{14+H} = 9.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning:\n   a_{14+0}, a_{14+1}, ... a_{14+H-1}\n\nThen the last action is at turn 14+H-1, and then the next state (turn 14+H) is 9.\n\nSo we are looking for the minimal H such that we can get from (14,3) to (14+H, 9) in H steps (each step being one turn).\n\nIn the state representation, we are at (t, y) meaning: at turn t, the player is at row y.\n\nThen from state (t, y), we choose an action a_t and then we move to (t+1, y') where y' = y + {+1, -1, 0} (clamped).\n\nWe start at (14,3). We want to reach a state (t,9) for some t>=14. The minimal t-14 is the minimal H? \n\nBut note: the number of actions is the number of turns we take actions. The turn we start is 14, and we take H actions: at turns 14, 15, ... 14+H-1, and then at turn 14+H we are at 9.\n\nSo H = (last turn index - 14) because we take one action per turn from 14 to 14+H-1, so the total turns taken: H, and the final state is at turn 14+H.\n\nTherefore, we are looking for the minimal H such that we can be at (14+H, 9).\n\nWe'll do BFS by time (turn) and row.\n\nWe note that the grid is small (rows 0..9) and time we can bound? The cars move at constant speed, so the collision pattern is periodic? But we can simulate until we reach row 9.\n\nWe'll use a queue: each state (t, y) and we record the previous action to build the path.\n\nWe start: (14, 3) with H0=0 (we haven't taken any action yet, but we are at the start). We want to take H actions and end at (14+H,9).\n\nActually, we start at turn14 and we are at row3. Then we take the first action (at turn14) and move to turn15 at row y15, etc.\n\nSo we can simulate:\n\n   State: (turn, y)\n   We start: (14,3) -> then we are going to take an action at turn14 to go to (15, y15)\n\nBut note: we must check the safety at (14,3): because at turn14, we are on row3. So we check row3 at turn14.\n\nSimilarly, after an action at turn14, we are at (15, y15) and then we are on row y15 at turn15, so we check row y15 at turn15.\n\nWe'll simulate:\n\n   Let dist[t][y] = the minimal number of actions taken to reach (t,y) from (14,3). We want min{ H: (14+H,9) is reached }.\n\n   We initialize: \n        dist[14][3] = 0, and we start at (14,3).\n\n   Then we consider from a state (t,y) we can go to (t+1, y') for y' in {y-1, y, y+1} (if within [0,9]), and we only do so if the state (t+1, y') is safe? \n\n   But note: the state (t,y) is the state at the beginning of turn t. Then we choose an action at turn t, and then we move to (t+1, y').\n\n   However, when we are at (t,y), we are about to take an action. But we must check that being at (t,y) is safe? \n\n   Actually, at turn t, we are at row y. So we must check safety at (t,y). If it is unsafe, we cannot be at (t,y).\n\n   Therefore, we must check the state (t,y) for safety.\n\n   So the algorithm:\n\n      Initialize: \n          queue = deque()\n          We check (14,3): is it safe?\n          If safe, set dist[14][3] = 0, and enqueue (14,3).\n\n      Then while queue not empty:\n          pop (t,y) \n          if y==9 and t>=14: then we have reached the goal at turn t. Then H = t - 14? \n          But note: we started at turn14 and we are at (t,y) and we have taken (t-14) actions? \n\n          Actually, the number of actions taken to get to (t,y) is (t-14). And we are at turn t. We require to be at row9 at some turn t. Then H = t - 14? \n\n          But the problem: we need to output the actions from turn14 to turn (t-1) because at turn t we are at the state without taking an action at turn t? \n\n          Actually, we are modeling: \n             At turn14: we start at (14,3) -> then we take an action at turn14 to move to (15, y15) -> so the state (15,y15) is the result of the first action.\n\n          Then we take an action at turn15 to move to (16,y16), etc.\n\n          Therefore, the state (t,y) is reached after (t-14) actions.\n\n          And we want to be at (t,9) for some t>=14. The minimal t such that we can be at (t,9) is what we want.\n\n          Then H = t - 14? But note the problem: the sequence of actions is for turns: 14, 15, ... up to the last action that gets us to 9. \n\n          How many actions? \n              Actions: at turn14, turn15, ... turn (t-1) -> because after the action at turn (t-1) we are at (t,9). \n\n          Therefore, the number of actions H = t - 14.\n\n          And we output the actions from turn14 to turn (t-1).\n\n          So if we find a state (t,9) with minimal t, then H = t - 14.\n\n      Then from (t,y) we consider next actions: we can go to (t+1, y-1), (t+1, y), (t+1, y+1) (if within bounds). But note: we must check the safety of the state (t,y) at the beginning? Actually, we already have (t,y) and we assume it's safe (because we only enqueue safe states). Then when we move to (t+1, y'), we must check the safety of (t+1, y').\n\n      Steps:\n\n          For each neighbor y' in {y-1, y, y+1} that is in [0,9]:\n              Let next_state = (t+1, y')\n              If we haven't visited (t+1, y') with a lower or equal t? Actually, we are doing BFS by time so we want the minimal t. Therefore, we can break ties by time (and we want the minimal time). So if we have already reached (t+1,y') at the same or earlier time, we skip.\n\n          But note: we might have multiple paths to (t+1,y') and we want the minimal t. So we do:\n\n              if (t+1,y') is safe and we haven't visited it with a smaller or equal t? Actually, we are going by increasing t, so the first time we get to (t+1,y') is the minimal t.\n\n          We can use a visited array per row? But time is unbounded? \n\n          However, note that the cars move with constant speed, so the collision pattern is periodic? But we don't know the period. But the minimal path is at most 20? Because we can go up 6 steps, so without waiting we can do 6. With waiting, we might wait a few turns.\n\n          We can set a time limit: say we go up to 100 turns? But minimal is at least 6.\n\n      Implementation:\n\n          We'll use a 2D array: dist[y][t] ... but t can be large. Instead, we can use a dictionary: visited[t] = set of rows visited at time t? But we are increasing t, so we can do:\n\n          Let best_time_for_row = [ infinity ] * 10   for each row, the minimal time t at which we reached that row? But note: we might wait, so we might have multiple times for the same row? And we want the minimal time to reach row9.\n\n          Actually, we are doing BFS by time (each step increases time by 1). So the first time we reach row9, that's the minimal time.\n\n          But we must avoid states that are unsafe.\n\n          We'll use a queue (BFS by time). We mark visited states (t,y) so that we don't revisit the same (t,y) (which is redundant). But note: we might come to (t,y) by different paths? But if we have been at (t,y) already, we skip.\n\n          Steps:\n\n            Let visited = set() of tuples (t,y)\n\n            Start: (14,3) -> add to visited, and set dist=0.\n\n            Then:\n\n              while queue not empty:\n                 (t,y) = queue.popleft()\n                 if y==9: \n                    we found the solution: H = t - 14, and we break.\n\n                 Check if (t,y) is safe? Actually, we checked when we enqueued? But we enqueued (14,3) after checking. Then we generate neighbors: (t+1, y-1), (t+1,y), (t+1,y+1). For each:\n\n                    if y' in [0,9] and (t+1,y') not visited and (t+1,y') is safe? \n\n                 Then we mark visited (t+1,y') and set the action that led to (t+1,y') from (t,y) (so we can backtrack the path).\n\n          We need to record the path: we can store for each state (t,y) the previous state (t_prev, y_prev) and the action taken at turn t_prev that led to (t,y). \n\n          Alternatively, we can store: \n                parent[t][y] = (action, previous state (t_prev, y_prev))\n\n          But we are using BFS and we are storing the entire path? We can store the parent pointers.\n\n          However, note: we are only storing the immediate parent.\n\n      Steps:\n\n          Let parent = {}  # key: (t,y), value: (prev_t, prev_y, action_taken_at_prev_t)\n\n          We start: parent[(14,3)] = None.\n\n          Then when we generate a state (t+1, y') from (t,y) via action a, we set:\n                parent[(t+1, y')] = (t, y, a)\n\n          Then when we reach (t,9), we backtrack from (t,9) to (14,3) to get the sequence of actions.\n\n          But note: the actions: \n               at turn t_prev (which is the parent state) we took action a, which led to (t_prev+1, y') -> so the action a was taken at turn t_prev.\n\n          Therefore, the actions we output are from turn14 to turn (t-1). \n\n          The sequence: \n                turn14: action1\n                turn15: action2\n                ...\n                turn (t-1): last action\n\n          How many? t - 14.\n\n      But note: the minimal time t for row9 might not be the first time we see row9? Because we are doing BFS by time, the first time we get to row9 is the minimal t.\n\n      However, we must avoid infinite loops: but we are going to row9, and we can only go up, down, or stay. We can set a time limit? Since the minimal steps to go from 3 to 9 is 6, and we might have to wait, but we can set a limit to say 100.\n\nLet me compute the safety at the initial state (14,3):\n\n   We are at freeway 3 at turn14.\n\n   Freeway3: one car: (24,13,right,12) -> at turn14: \n        tail14 = 13 + 12*(14-14)=13\n        head14 = 24 + 12*(14-14)=24\n        span = [13,24] -> 0 is not in [13,24] -> safe.\n\n   So (14,3) is safe.\n\nThen we start.\n\nWe'll simulate:\n\n   We'll create a queue: collections.deque()\n\n   We start: (14,3) -> then we generate:\n\n        t=14, y=3: \n            actions: U -> (15,4)\n                    D -> (15,2)\n                    S -> (15,3)\n\n        Then we check each:\n\n            (15,4): freeway4 at turn15 -> freeway4 has one car: (24,13,right,12)\n                    tail15 = 13 + 12*(15-14)=13+12=25\n                    head15=24+12=36 -> [25,36] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\n            (15,2): freeway2 at turn15 -> car: (24,13,right,12) -> \n                    tail15=13+12=25, head15=24+12=36 -> safe.\n\n            (15,3): freeway3 at turn15 -> car: (24,13,right,12) -> \n                    tail15=13+12=25, head15=24+12=36 -> safe.\n\n        So all three are safe. We enqueue them.\n\n   Then we continue.\n\n   We are looking for the minimal time t such that we are at (t,9). \n\n   The minimal t is at least 14+6 = 20? Because we start at row3 and we need to go up 6 times. Without waiting, we can do:\n\n        t14: start at 3\n        t15: 4 (if we go U)\n        t16: 5\n        t17: 6\n        t18: 7\n        t19: 8\n        t20: 9 -> so we can be at (20,9) by going U every turn.\n\n   But we must check the safety of the intermediate freeways.\n\n   Let's check the path: U every turn from (14,3) to (20,9):\n\n        Turn14: y=3 -> freeway3: safe (as above)\n        Turn15: y=4 -> freeway4: at turn15: car: [13+12=25,24+12=36] -> safe.\n        Turn16: y=5 -> freeway5: same as freeway4: car [13+12*2=37,24+12*2=48] -> safe.\n        Turn17: y=6 -> freeway6: two cars:\n                car1: (24,13,right,12) -> at turn17: 13+12*3=13+36=49, 24+36=60 -> [49,60] -> safe.\n                car2: (-24,-35,right,12) -> at turn17: -35+12*3 = -35+36=1, -24+36=12 -> [1,12] -> 0 is not in [1,12]? -> safe? \n                    But wait: 0 is not in [1,12] -> safe.\n\n        Turn18: y=7 -> freeway7: two cars:\n                car1: (0,-11,right,6) -> at turn18: \n                      tail18 = -11 + 6*(18-14) = -11+6*4 = -11+24=13\n                      head18 = 0+24=24 -> [13,24] -> safe (0 not in)\n                car2: (48,37,right,6) -> 37+24=61, 48+24=72 -> safe.\n\n        Turn19: y=8 -> freeway8: same as freeway7: \n                car1: -11+6*5 = -11+30=19, 0+30=30 -> [19,30] -> safe.\n                car2: 37+30=67, 48+30=78 -> safe.\n\n        Turn20: y=9 -> safe (no freeway for 9).\n\n        So the path of 6 Ups is safe.\n\n        Therefore, minimal H is 6? \n\n        Then the actions: \n             turn14: U\n             turn15: U\n             turn16: U\n             turn17: U\n             turn18: U\n             turn19: U\n\n        Then at turn20 we are at 9.\n\n        So the sequence: \n            Turn 14: U\n            Turn 15: U\n            Turn 16: U\n            Turn 17: U\n            Turn 18: U\n            Turn 19: U\n\n        But note: the last action is at turn19 (the 6th action) and then at turn20 we are at 9.\n\n        Therefore, H=6.\n\n        And the sequence: \n            Turn 14: U\n            Turn 15: U\n            Turn 16: U\n            Turn 17: U\n            Turn 18: U\n            Turn 19: U\n\n        We output:\n\n            Turn 14: U\n            Turn 15: U\n            Turn 16: U\n            Turn 17: U\n            Turn 18: U\n            Turn 19: U\n\n        But let me double-check the freeway at turn17: row6. \n            Freeway6: car2: (-24,-35,right,12) at turn17 (t=17, so t-14=3): \n                tail = -35 + 12*3 = -35+36=1\n                head = -24 + 12*3 = -24+36=12\n                so the car is from 1 to 12. \n                The player is at row6 at turn17? But we are at row6 at turn17: and the car on freeway6 at turn17: we check if 0 is in [1,12]? -> no. So safe.\n\n        However, note: at turn17, the player is at row6. The car on freeway6 at turn17: the car is from 1 to 12. So the car is at x in [1,12] at turn17. The player is at x=0, so no collision.\n\n        Therefore, it is safe.\n\n        But wait: the collision condition: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 in Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T\". \n\n        Since the player is at x=0, and the car is at x in [1,12], then 0 is not in [1,12] -> safe.\n\n        So the path is safe.\n\n        Therefore, the answer is 6 turns of U.\n\n        But let me check if there is a shorter path? H must be at least 6 because we need to go from 3 to 9 (6 steps). So minimal H=6.\n\n        Therefore, we output:\n\n            Turn 14: U\n            Turn 15: U\n            Turn 16: U\n            Turn 17: U\n            Turn 18: U\n            Turn 19: U\n\n        However, note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and we have H=6.\n\n        But wait: the problem says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning t from 0 to 5 (if H=6). So:\n\n            t=0: a14\n            t=1: a15\n            ...\n            t=5: a19\n\n        So 6 actions.\n\n        But in the output, we write:\n\n            Turn 14: U\n            Turn 15: U\n            Turn 16: U\n            Turn 17: U\n            Turn 18: U\n            Turn 19: U\n\n        This matches.\n\n        However, let me check one more thing: at turn17, freeway6: the car is from 1 to 12. What if we had been at freeway6 at turn16? \n\n        Actually, we are going up: \n          turn14: row3\n          turn15: row4\n          turn16: row5\n          turn17: row6\n          turn18: row7\n          turn19: row8\n          turn20: row9\n\n        So we are never on the same freeway at an earlier turn? \n\n        Therefore, the solution is the above.\n\n        But wait: the freeway6 at turn16: \n            car2: (-24,-35,right,12) at turn16 (t=16, t-14=2): \n                tail = -35+12*2 = -35+24=-11\n                head = -24+24=0\n                so the car is from -11 to 0. \n\n            At turn16, we are at row5 (freeway5) -> not freeway6. \n\n            At turn17, we are at row6 (freeway6) and the car is from 1 to 12 -> safe.\n\n        So it is safe.\n\n        But what about freeway7 and 8? \n\n        At turn18: we are at row7 (freeway7) at turn18 (t=18, t-14=4): \n            car1: (0,-11,right,6): \n                tail = -11+6*4 = -11+24=13\n                head = 0+24=24 -> safe.\n\n        At turn19: row8 at turn19 (t=19, t-14=5): \n            car1: (0,-11,right,6): \n                tail = -11+6*5 = -11+30=19\n                head = 0+30=30 -> safe.\n\n        So the entire path is safe.\n\n        Therefore, the answer is 6 consecutive Ups.\n\n        But note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\". We have H=6.\n\n        However, what if there is a path that takes less than 6 turns? Impossible because we need to cover 6 units.\n\n        Therefore, we output the sequence.\n\nBut wait: the problem says \"avoid collisions\", and we have checked the entire path and found it safe.\n\nHowever, let me check freeway6 at turn17 again: the car is from 1 to 12. The player is at (0,6) at turn17: that is safe.\n\nBut what about the other car on freeway6? The first car: (24,13,right,12) at turn17: \n    tail = 13+12*3 = 13+36=49, head=24+36=60 -> safe.\n\nSo yes.\n\nBut note: freeway6 has two cars: the second car we checked.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: U\nTurn 16: U\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\nTurn 19: U\n}\n\nHowever, the problem says: \"Given the initial position (0, y_{t1})\" and t1=14. And we are to output the actions for turns 14, 15, ... until the last action.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning for t from 0 to H-1, so a_{14}, a_{15}, ... a_{14+H-1}. Here H=6, so t from 0 to 5: a14 to a19.\n\nSo the output is as above.\n\nBut wait: the problem says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" and then \"Turn t_1+1: a_{t_1+1}\", etc.\n\nSo:\n\n    Turn 14: U\n    Turn 15: U\n    Turn 16: U\n    Turn 17: U\n    Turn 18: U\n    Turn 19: U\n\nBut note: the last action is at turn19, and then at turn20 we are at 9.\n\nThis matches.\n\nTherefore, we output the above.\n\nHowever, let me be cautious: what if there is a car that we missed?\n\nAt turn17, freeway6: \n   The two cars: \n        car1: (24,13,right,12) -> [13+12*3,24+12*3] = [49,60] -> safe.\n        car2: (-24,-35,right,12) -> [-35+12*3, -24+12*3] = [1,12] -> safe.\n\nAt turn18, freeway7: \n   car1: (0,-11,right,6) -> [-11+6*4,0+6*4] = [13,24] -> safe.\n   car2: (48,37,right,6) -> [37+24,48+24]=[61,72] -> safe.\n\nAt turn19, freeway8: same as freeway7 at turn19? \n   Actually, freeway8 has the same cars? \n        car1: (0,-11,right,6) -> at turn19: [-11+6*5,0+6*5] = [19,30] -> safe.\n        car2: (48,37,right,6) -> [37+30,48+30]=[67,78] -> safe.\n\nSo all safe.\n\nTherefore, the answer is the sequence of 6 Ups.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\" and we have 6.\n\nHowever, what if we can do it in 5 turns? Impossible because we start at 3 and need to get to 9: 6 steps.\n\nTherefore, we output:\n\n    Turn 14: U\n    Turn 15: U\n    Turn 16: U\n    Turn 17: U\n    Turn 18: U\n    Turn 19: U\n\nBut wait: the problem says \"avoid collisions\", and we have to avoid collisions at every turn we are on a freeway. We have done so.\n\nHowever, note that the player might be able to go faster by using D or S? But that would only slow down. So minimal is 6.\n\nTherefore, we output the above.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H\", and we have H=6.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: U\nTurn 16: U\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\nTurn 19: U\n}\n\nBut wait: the problem says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\", so we have 6 actions: t=0 (14), t=1 (15), ... t=5 (19). Correct.\n\nTherefore, we are done.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 3)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 14\\) is 6.

The vertical position is bounded between 0 and 9.\n\nWe note that collision occurs only if at the turn T when the player is on freeway k (i.e., y_T = k), there is a car on that freeway such that 0 (the x-coordinate of the player) is in the car's span at that exact turn T.\n\nImportant: When moving from y_T to y_{T+1} at turn T, the player is considered to be on row y_T during turn T, and then on row y_{T+1} at turn T+1. Therefore, when moving at turn T, we only check the freeway of the current row y_T for collision at turn T. The next row y_{T+1} will be checked at turn T+1.\n\nWe are given the car states at turn t1=15 for freeways 1 to 8.\n\nWe need to compute the car spans at future turns. The car movement:\n\nFor a car at turn t1 (15) with head h, tail tau, direction d, and speed s:\n\n- If the car is left-moving (but note: the given directions are all \"right\", so we assume left-moving would have direction \"left\", but here all are right) -> so we have only right-moving cars.\n\nFor a right-moving car:\n  At turn T (>=15), the span is [tau + s*(T-15), h + s*(T-15)]\n\nBut note: the representation in the table for right-moving cars is given as (head, tail, direction, speed). However, for a right-moving car, the head is the front (which is the larger x-coordinate) and the tail is the rear (smaller x-coordinate). So at turn 15, the car is from tau to h (with tau < h). Then at turn T, it moves so that the entire car is shifted to the right by s*(T-15). So:\n  tail(T) = tau + s*(T-15)\n  head(T) = h + s*(T-15)\n\nThus the span at T is [tau + s*(T-15), h + s*(T-15)].\n\nCollision occurs at turn T on freeway k if the player is at (0, k) and there exists a car on freeway k such that:\n  0 is in [tau + s*(T-15), h + s*(T-15)]\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T\". So we must check every car on the freeway the player is currently on.\n\nWe are to find the minimal H and a sequence of actions from turn 15 to turn 15+H-1 such that the player ends at y=9.\n\nThe initial position is (0,4). We must avoid freeways 1 to 8 when there is a car that covers x=0 at the exact turn we are on that freeway.\n\nWe can plan a path that moves up, down, or stays, but note that we cannot go below 0 or above 9.\n\nWe note that the goal is row 9. Since row 9 is the top and there is no freeway above 8 (the freeways are from 1 to 8), so when we are on row 9, we are safe (no cars on row 9). However, we must get there without being hit on rows 1 to 8.\n\nWe must compute for each freeway and for each future turn T (>=15) whether there is a car that covers x=0 at that turn.\n\nBut note: the cars on a freeway are independent. We'll precompute for each freeway k (1..8) and for each turn T (starting from 15) the condition: is there a car on freeway k at turn T that has 0 in its span?\n\nWe are only concerned with turns from 15 onward until we reach row 9.\n\nSince we want minimal H, we aim for the shortest path: ideally moving up 5 times (from 4 to 9) in 5 turns. But we must avoid collisions.\n\nLet's check each freeway for the critical turns when a car is present at x=0.\n\nWe'll compute for each freeway k the set of turns T (>=15) for which there is at least one car on freeway k such that:\n  0 is in [tau + s*(T-15), h + s*(T-15)]\n\nNote: Since the cars are moving continuously, the condition for a single car is:\n  tau + s*(T-15) <= 0 <= h + s*(T-15)\n\nWe can solve for T:\n\n  T >= 15 + (0 - h)/s   and   T <= 15 + (0 - tau)/s   [but note: for a right-moving car, we have tau < h. However, note that the car is moving to the right, so the entire car is shifting right. The condition for 0 being in the interval is:\n\n  tau + s*(T-15) <= 0 <= h + s*(T-15)\n\nRearranged:\n\n  (0 - h)/s <= T-15 <= (0 - tau)/s\n\nBut note: since s is positive and h and tau are integers, we must be cautious. Also, note that if the car is moving right, then as T increases, the entire car moves to the right. So the interval [tau + s*(T-15), h + s*(T-15)] moves to the right.\n\nHowever, note that h and tau might be negative or positive. The condition for 0 being in the span is:\n\n  tau + s*(T-15) <= 0   and   0 <= h + s*(T-15)\n\nBut wait: for a right-moving car, the span is [tau + s*(T-15), h + s*(T-15)] and since tau < h, the interval is non-empty. So we require:\n\n  tau + s*(T-15) <= 0   ->   T-15 <= -tau / s\n  and\n  h + s*(T-15) >= 0   ->   T-15 >= -h / s\n\nBut note: because tau < h and both are integers, and s is positive, we have:\n\n  T-15 in [ ceil((-h)/s), floor((-tau)/s) ]\n\nBut note: since we are dealing with integers and T is integer, we can compute:\n\n  Let L = ceil( (-h) / s )   [but note: we have T-15 >= (-h)/s, so the smallest integer T-15 that is >= (-h)/s is ceil((-h)/s) if (-h)/s is not integer, but if it is integer then we can use that integer. Similarly, T-15 <= (-tau)/s, so the largest integer T-15 is floor((-tau)/s).]\n\nActually, we can write:\n\n  T-15 must be an integer in the interval [ max( ceil((-h)/s), 0 ), floor((-tau)/s) ]   ??? But note: T-15>=0 because T>=15.\n\nBut actually, the condition is:\n\n  (-h)/s <= T-15 <= (-tau)/s\n\nSince s>0, we can rewrite:\n\n  T-15 >= ceil( (-h)/s )   [because T-15 must be at least the smallest integer >= (-h)/s]? Not exactly: if (-h)/s is not integer, then we need T-15 >= ceil((-h)/s). But if it is integer, then T-15 can be that integer.\n\nSimilarly, T-15 <= floor( (-tau)/s )? Actually, we require T-15 <= (-tau)/s, so the largest integer T-15 that satisfies is floor( (-tau)/s ).\n\nBut note: if (-tau)/s is an integer, then T-15 can be that integer. So:\n\n  Lower bound: L = ceil( (-h) / s )   [if (-h)/s is integer, then ceil is that integer, which is correct]\n  Upper bound: U = floor( (-tau) / s )\n\nThen T-15 must be an integer in [L, U] (if L<=U).\n\nHowever, note: if the car is not present at x=0 at any T, then we don't have to worry.\n\nBut wait: let me test with a simple example.\n\nExample: car on freeway 1: (-21, -32, right, 3) at turn 15.\n\nFor this car at turn T:\n  tail(T) = -32 + 3*(T-15)\n  head(T) = -21 + 3*(T-15)\n\nCondition for 0 in [tail(T), head(T)]:\n  -32 + 3*(T-15) <= 0 <= -21 + 3*(T-15)\n\nSolve:\n  -32 + 3*(T-15) <= 0  => 3*(T-15) <= 32 => T-15 <= 32/3 ≈ 10.666 -> T-15 <= 10 (if we take integer part, but we are using real numbers? Actually, T is integer, so we can use inequalities with integers.)\n\nBut we can do:\n\n  Part 1: -32 + 3*(T-15) <= 0  => 3*(T-15) <= 32 => T-15 <= floor(32/3) = 10 -> so T-15 <= 10.\n  Part 2: 0 <= -21 + 3*(T-15) => 3*(T-15) >= 21 => T-15 >= 7.\n\nSo T-15 in [7,10]. That is, at turns T=15+7=22, 23, 24, 25? But wait: T-15=7 -> T=22, then T-15=10 -> T=25.\n\nBut let's check T=22:\n  tail(22) = -32 + 3*(7) = -32+21 = -11\n  head(22) = -21 + 21 = 0 -> so 0 is included? Actually, the span at T=22 is [-11,0]. So 0 is the head -> included? Yes.\n\nT=23: tail= -32+3*8 = -32+24=-8, head=-21+24=3 -> [ -8, 3] -> 0 included.\nT=24: tail=-32+9*3=-32+27=-5, head=-21+27=6 -> included.\nT=25: tail=-32+10*3=-32+30=-2, head=-21+30=9 -> included.\n\nBut wait, our calculation: T-15=7,8,9,10 -> T=22,23,24,25.\n\nBut note: at T=15, the car is at [-32,-21] -> so x=0 is not covered. Then as the car moves right, it will eventually cover x=0.\n\nSo for freeway 1, the dangerous turns are T=22,23,24,25.\n\nNow, let's do the same for every freeway.\n\nFreeway 1: car (-21, -32, right, 3) -> dangerous at T=22,23,24,25.\n\nFreeway 2: car (36,25,right,12). Note: head=36, tail=25? But wait, for a right-moving car, we expect tail to be less than head. Here tail=25, head=36 -> that's correct.\n\nCondition: \n  25 + 12*(T-15) <= 0 <= 36 + 12*(T-15)\n\nBut note: 25 + 12*(T-15) is increasing. At T=15: 25<=0<=36 -> false. For T>15, the left bound is increasing and becomes positive. So we require:\n\n  25 + 12*(T-15) <= 0  -> 12*(T-15) <= -25 -> T-15 <= -25/12 ≈ -2.08 -> impossible.\n\nSo freeway 2 is safe? But wait: the condition is actually the other way? Let me check:\n\nWe require 0 to be between [25+12*(T-15), 36+12*(T-15)]. Since 25+12*(T-15) is at least 25 (at T=15) and then increases, so it will never be <=0? So no collision on freeway 2.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3,4,5: same car (36,25,right,12) -> safe.\n\nFreeway 6: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (36,25,right,12) -> same as above, safe.\n\nSecond car: (-12,-23,right,12). \n\nCondition for the second car:\n  tail(T) = -23 + 12*(T-15)\n  head(T) = -12 + 12*(T-15)\n\nCondition: \n  -23 + 12*(T-15) <= 0 <= -12 + 12*(T-15)\n\nPart1: -23+12*(T-15)<=0 -> 12*(T-15)<=23 -> T-15<=23/12≈1.916 -> T-15<=1 -> T<=16\nPart2: 0<=-12+12*(T-15) -> 12*(T-15)>=12 -> T-15>=1 -> T>=16\n\nSo T-15=1 -> T=16.\n\nCheck T=16:\n  tail(16)= -23+12= -11\n  head(16)= -12+12=0\n  So the span is [-11,0] -> 0 is included? Yes.\n\nSo freeway 6 is dangerous at T=16 (only) due to the second car.\n\nFreeway 7: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (6, -5, right, 6) -> note: head=6, tail=-5? Actually, for a right-moving car, the tail is the leftmost and head the rightmost? But -5<6, so that's fine.\n\nCondition for first car:\n  -5 + 6*(T-15) <= 0 <= 6 + 6*(T-15)\n\nPart1: -5+6*(T-15)<=0 -> 6*(T-15)<=5 -> T-15<=5/6≈0.833 -> T-15<=0 -> T<=15\nPart2: 0<=6+6*(T-15) -> 6*(T-15)>=-6 -> T-15>=-1 -> always true for T>=15.\n\nSo the only integer T>=15 satisfying is T=15? \n\nAt T=15: \n  tail(15) = -5\n  head(15) = 6\n  So the span is [-5,6] -> 0 is included. So at turn 15, freeway 7 has a car that covers x=0.\n\nBut wait, we are at turn 15 and the player is at (0,4). So we are on freeway 4? Therefore, at turn 15 we are not on freeway 7. So we don't collide at T=15 on freeway 7.\n\nBut if we are on freeway 7 at turn T, then we must avoid T=15? Actually, T=15 is the starting turn and we are not on freeway 7. So we don't care about T=15 for freeway 7? \n\nBut note: the problem says \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T\". At turn 15, the player is on freeway 4, so we only check freeway 4. \n\nSo for freeway 7, we must avoid being on freeway 7 at T=15? But we are not there at T=15. So we are safe at T=15? Actually, we are not on freeway 7 at T=15, so no collision.\n\nBut what about other turns? The condition for the first car:\n\nWe found that the only T in [15, ...) that satisfies the condition is T=15? But at T=16:\n  tail(16)= -5+6=1 -> so the span is [1, 6+6=12] -> 0 is not in [1,12]. So only T=15 is dangerous for the first car? But we don't care about T=15 for freeway 7 because we are not there.\n\nNow the second car on freeway 7: (54,43,right,6)\n\nCondition:\n  43+6*(T-15) <= 0 <= 54+6*(T-15)\n\nBut 43+6*(T-15) is at least 43 at T=15, so it's always positive -> 0 cannot be in the interval. So the second car is never at x=0.\n\nTherefore, freeway 7 is safe for all T>=15? Only the first car was dangerous at T=15, but we are not on freeway 7 at T=15.\n\nBut wait: what if we are on freeway 7 at T=15? We are at (0,4) at T=15, so y=4. So we are not on freeway 7. Therefore, freeway 7 has no dangerous turns for T>=15? \n\nBut let me double-check the first car at T=15: it covers [-5,6] -> so x=0 is covered. But we are not on freeway 7 at T=15, so we are safe. For T>15, the first car moves to the right: at T=16: [1,12] -> 0 not covered. So indeed freeway 7 is safe for T>=16.\n\nFreeway 8: two cars: same as freeway 7? \n  First car: (6, -5, right, 6) -> dangerous only at T=15? But we are not on freeway 8 at T=15 -> safe for T>=15? \n  Second car: (54,43,right,6) -> same as above, never dangerous.\n\nSo freeway 8 is safe.\n\nBut wait, freeway 7 and 8 have the same cars? The table says for freeway 7 and 8 the same set of cars? \n\nSo to summarize the dangerous freeways and turns:\n\nFreeway 1: dangerous at T=22,23,24,25.\nFreeway 6: dangerous at T=16.\n\nWe must avoid being on freeway 1 at turns 22,23,24,25 and on freeway 6 at turn 16.\n\nNow, the player starts at y=4 at turn 15.\n\nGoal: reach y=9 as quickly as possible.\n\nThe minimal number of turns is 5 (if we go straight up: 4->5->6->7->8->9). But we must check the path for collisions.\n\nWe plan the moves:\n\nAt turn 15: we are at y=4. We can choose U, D, or S.\n\nWe must avoid:\n\n- On turn 16: we must not be on freeway 6 (if we are on freeway 6 at turn 16, we crash). \n\nBut note: at turn 15, we are at y=4. Then at turn 15 we choose an action that determines y_16.\n\nPossible actions at turn 15:\n  U: then y16 = 5.\n  S: then y16 = 4.\n  D: then y16 = 3.\n\nIf we go to y=5 at turn 16, then we are on freeway 5 at turn 16? But freeway 5 is safe (we saw that freeway 5 has no dangerous turns). So that's safe.\n\nBut we must also avoid freeway 6 at turn 16. If we are at y=6 at turn 16, we crash. So we must not be at y=6 at turn 16.\n\nSo at turn 16, we can be at y=5 (if we moved up from 4) or y=4 (if we stayed) or y=3 (if we moved down). \n\nWe want to get to 9 as fast as possible, so moving up is preferred.\n\nBut we also have to worry about freeway 1 in the future (turns 22-25). However, if we can get to 9 before turn 22, then we avoid freeway 1 entirely.\n\nThe minimal number of turns is 5, so we would be at turn 15+4 = 19 when we reach 9? \n\nWait: \n  Turn 15: start at 4.\n  Turn 16: at 5 (if we do U at 15)\n  Turn 17: at 6 (if we do U at 16)\n  Turn 18: at 7\n  Turn 19: at 8\n  Turn 20: at 9 -> then we stop at turn 20? \n\nBut note: the sequence of actions: from turn 15 to turn 15+H-1, and we require that at turn 15+H-1 we are at 9.\n\nSo if we do 5 moves: \n  t=15: U -> to 5\n  t=16: U -> to 6\n  t=17: U -> to 7\n  t=18: U -> to 8\n  t=19: U -> to 9\n\nThen at turn 19 (which is 15+4) we are at 9? Actually, the last action is at turn 15+4=19, and then the position becomes 9. So H=5 turns: from turn15 to turn19.\n\nBut note: we must avoid collisions at every turn we are on a freeway (1..8). \n\nIn this plan:\n\nTurn 15: at y=4 -> freeway 4? But freeway 4 has a car (36,25,right,12) -> we computed it's safe (no collision at any turn). So safe.\n\nTurn 16: at y=5 -> freeway 5: same car -> safe.\n\nTurn 17: at y=6 -> freeway 6. But freeway 6 is dangerous at turn 16? But we are at turn 17. \n\nWe must check freeway 6 at turn 17.\n\nFor freeway 6, we have two cars:\n\nFirst car: (36,25,right,12) -> at turn T=17: \n  tail(17)=25+12*(17-15)=25+24=49\n  head(17)=36+24=60 -> [49,60] -> 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: (-12,-23,right,12) -> at turn 17:\n  tail(17)=-23+12*(2)= -23+24=1\n  head(17)=-12+24=12 -> [1,12] -> 0 not in.\n\nSo at turn 17, freeway 6 is safe.\n\nBut note: the dangerous turn for freeway 6 was only 16. So at turn 17 it is safe.\n\nTurn 18: at y=7 -> freeway 7. We computed freeway 7 is safe for T>=16? So safe.\n\nTurn 19: at y=8 -> freeway 8: safe.\n\nThen at turn 19 we move to y=9 -> which is not a freeway, so safe.\n\nTherefore, the plan: 5 moves: U, U, U, U, U.\n\nBut wait: at turn 16 we are at y=5, which is safe. At turn 17 we are at y=6, which we just computed is safe at T=17.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nTurn 15: U -> to 5\nTurn 16: U -> to 6\nTurn 17: U -> to 7\nTurn 18: U -> to 8\nTurn 19: U -> to 9\n\nWe are done at turn 19 (H=5).\n\nBut note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and 5 is the minimal because we have to move 5 steps up.\n\nHowever, we must check if there is any danger at the intermediate freeways at the exact turns we are there.\n\nWe did:\n\nTurn 15: y=4 -> freeway4: car (36,25,right,12) at T=15: \n  span: [25,36] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\nTurn 16: y=5 -> freeway5: same car: [25+12, 36+12]=[37,48] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\nTurn 17: y=6 -> freeway6: \n  first car: [25+12*2=49, 36+24=60] -> safe.\n  second car: [-23+12*2=1, -12+24=12] -> safe (0 not in [1,12]).\n\nTurn 18: y=7 -> freeway7: \n  first car: at T=18: \n      tail = -5 + 6*(18-15) = -5+18=13 -> [13, 6+18=24] -> safe.\n  second car: [43+18=61, 54+18=72] -> safe.\n\nTurn 19: y=8 -> freeway8: same as freeway7? \n  first car: tail=-5+6*(19-15)= -5+24=19 -> [19, 6+24=30] -> safe.\n  second car: [43+24=67, 54+24=78] -> safe.\n\nSo the plan is safe.\n\nBut what about freeway1? We never go to freeway1 and we are done by turn19, which is before turn22. So no problem.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 5 and the sequence is U, U, U, U, U.\n\nBut let me write the actions for turns 15,16,17,18,19.\n\nAnswer:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 15: U\nTurn 16: U\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\nTurn 19: U\n}\n\nHowever, note: the problem says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning for t from 0 to H-1. Here H=5, so t=0,1,2,3,4 corresponding to turns 15,16,17,18,19.\n\nBut the problem says: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence ... to reach (0,9)\".\n\nWe reached at turn19: y=9.\n\nBut wait: is there a possibility to get there faster? For example, by moving faster? But we can only move one step at a time. So 5 moves is the minimum.\n\nAlternatively, could we take a detour? But that would take more moves. So 5 is minimal.\n\nBut what if we had to avoid freeway6 at turn16? In our plan we didn't go to freeway6 at turn16. We went to freeway5 at turn16 and freeway6 at turn17 (which is safe).\n\nSo we are safe.\n\nBut let me check freeway6 at turn16 again: we have a car that covers x=0 at turn16. So if we had gone to freeway6 at turn16, we would crash. But we went to freeway5 at turn16, so safe.\n\nTherefore, the answer is the sequence of 5 U's.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"avoid collisions with cars on freeways y=1,...,8\". And we did.\n\nBut what if we tried to go faster? We cannot.\n\nOne more thing: the freeway 1 danger at turns 22-25. Since we are done at turn19, we avoid that.\n\nSo we output:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 15: U\nTurn 16: U\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\nTurn 19: U\n}\n\nBut let me write it exactly as required.\n\nNote: the current turn is t1=15.\n\nWe write for each turn from 15 to 19.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 15: U\nTurn 16: U\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\nTurn 19: U\n\nBut wait: at turn19, we do U and then we are at 9. Then we stop. So that's the last action.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 5.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\". Here t_1=15, so the actions are for t=0 to 4 (which is 5 actions) at times 15,16,17,18,19.\n\nSo the answer is as above.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 4)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 15\\) is 5. The sequence of actions is five consecutive \"U\" (up) moves, which move the player from \\(y = 4\\) to \\(y = 9\\) in the fewest turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Collision Avoidance Verification:\n- **Freeway 1**: Dangerous at turns 22, 23, 24, 25. The player is not on freeway 1 during these turns (path: turns 15–19).\n- **Freeway 6**: Dangerous at turn 16. The player is at \\(y = 5\\) (freeway 5) at turn 16, not freeway 6.\n- **Other freeways (2–5, 7–8)**: No dangerous turns for \\(T \\geq 15\\) that coincide with the player's path.\n\n### Path Details:\n- **Turn 15**: Start at \\(y = 4\\).

The current turn is t1 = 16, and I start at y=5.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the car movements. Each car has a head, tail, direction, and speed. The span moves left or right based on the direction.\n\nFor left-moving cars, the span is [h, τ] at t1, and at time T, it's [h - s(T - t1), τ - s(T - t1)]. For right-moving, it's [τ, h] at t1, and [τ + s(T - t1), h + s(T - t1)] at T.\n\nCollision happens at turn T if the player is on a freeway y_T and 0 is within the span of any car on that freeway at that turn.\n\nAlso, when moving to a new y, you're not on that y until the next turn, so you only check collision for the y you're currently on.\n\nI start at turn t1=16, position y=5.\n\nI need to go to y=9, so I have to move up, but I have to avoid cars on y=6,7,8 since y=5 is my start, and I might need to pass through other rows.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, I think, since cars are only on y=1 to 8.\n\nThe problem says \"freeways y=1,...,8\", so y=0 and y=9 are the edges, probably no cars there, so safe.\n\nBut I start on y=5 at turn 16, and I need to reach y=9.\n\nThe player update: at each turn, I choose U, D, or S, changing y by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nSince I need to go up, D might not be useful, but I might need to go down to avoid cars, but that seems inefficient. Probably, I should go up as much as possible, but avoid collisions.\n\nFirst, I need to know where the cars are at each future turn relative to x=0.\n\nThe collision is checked only when I'm on a freeway, and only if 0 is in the car's span at that exact turn.\n\nAlso, for the turn when I move to a new y, I'm not on that new y until after the move, so for collision on that y, it's only when I'm staying or arriving? Let's read carefully.\n\n\"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\ny_T is the y-position at turn T.\n\nAt turn T, I am at position (0, y_T), and I am on freeway y_T.\n\nIf I choose an action at turn T, I move to y_{T+1} at the next turn.\n\nThe collision is checked at turn T based on y_T and the car spans at turn T for that freeway.\n\nSpecifically: \"you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T\", so at turn T, you are on y_T, and you check cars on y_T at time T.\n\nThen, after action, you go to y_{T+1} for turn T+1.\n\nSo, for example, at turn T, if I am on y, I check if 0 is in any car span on y at time T. If not, safe. Then I move to new y for next turn.\n\nSimilarly, when I arrive at a new y, say at turn T+1, I am on y_{T+1} at turn T+1, so I check cars on that freeway at time T+1.\n\nThe key point is that when I move from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T I am on y, and I check cars on y at T. At turn T+1, I am on y+1, and I check cars on y+1 at T+1.\n\nI don't check y+1 at turn T because I'm not there yet.\n\nSimilarly, if I stay, I check the same y at that turn.\n\nNow, for the cars, I need to compute their spans at each future turn from t1=16.\n\nLet t be the turn number, with t=16 as the starting point.\n\nSo for a car, at time T, span depends on T - 16.\n\nLet Δt = T - 16, so at time T, Δt = T - 16.\n\nFor each car, given at t=16, head, tail, direction, speed.\n\nFirst, for freeway 1: only one car: (-18, -29, right, 3)\n\nDirection right? But head and tail: it says head h, tail τ.\n\nFor right-moving cars, it says \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\" and for left, [h, τ].\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 1: (-18, -29, right, 3)\n\nSince direction is right, span at t1 is [τ, h] = [-29, -18]? But -29 < -18, so [ -29, -18 ].\n\nThen at time T, span is [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] = [-29 + 3Δt, -18 + 3Δt]\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, but this one is right.\n\nNow, collision if 0 is in the span, meaning min <= 0 <= max of the interval.\n\nSince it's a closed interval, I assume.\n\nNow for freeway 2: (48, 37, right, 12)\n\nDirection right, so span at t1: [τ, h] = [37, 48]\n\nAt T: [37 + 12 Δt, 48 + 12 Δt]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as freeway 2? (48, 37, right, 12) — identical?\n\nFreeway 4: (48, 37, right, 12) same.\n\nFreeway 5: (48, 37, right, 12) same.\n\nAll freeways 2,3,4,5 have the same car: (48,37,right,12)\n\nBut each freeway can have multiple cars? No, for freeway 2, it's one entry, but it says \"Cars\" and lists one tuple, so I think each freeway has one or more cars.\n\nFor freeway 6, it has two: (48,37,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12)\n\nSimilarly, 7 and 8 have two each.\n\nLet's list all cars per freeway.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: h=-18, τ=-29, d=right, s=3\n\nSince right, span at t1: [τ, h] = [-29, -18]\n\nAt T: [ -29 + 3Δt, -18 + 3Δt ]\n\nFreeway 2: one car: (48,37,right,12) so [37,48] at t1, at T: [37 + 12Δt, 48 + 12Δt]\n\nFreeway 3: same as freeway 2: (48,37,right,12) → [37+12Δt, 48+12Δt] at T\n\nFreeway 4: same\n\nFreeway 5: same\n\nFreeway 6: two cars: first (48,37,right,12) same as above, and second (0,-11,right,12)\n\nFor second car: h=0, τ=-11, d=right, s=12\n\nSpan at t1: since right, [τ, h] = [-11, 0]\n\nAt T: [-11 + 12Δt, 0 + 12Δt] = [-11 + 12Δt, 12Δt]\n\nFreeway 7: two cars: (12,1,right,6) and (60,49,right,6)\n\nFirst car: h=12, τ=1, d=right, s=6 → span at t1: [τ,h] = [1,12]\n\nAt T: [1 + 6Δt, 12 + 6Δt]\n\nSecond car: (60,49,right,6) → [49,60] at t1, at T: [49 + 6Δt, 60 + 6Δt]\n\nFreeway 8: same as freeway 7? (12,1,right,6), (60,49,right,6) identical to freeway 7.\n\nNow, I need to be on freeway y at time T only if y between 1 and 8, and I need to avoid 0 being in any car span on that freeway at that time.\n\nSince there might be multiple cars, I need to check all on that row.\n\nNow, I start at y=5 at t=16.\n\ny=5 is a freeway? Freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=5 is freeway 5.\n\nFreeway k corresponds to y=k, I assume.\n\nSo at t=16, I am on y=5, freeway 5.\n\nFreeway 5 has one car: (48,37,right,12) so span at t=16: [37,48]? At T=16, Δt=0, [37,48]\n\nIs 0 in [37,48]? 37 to 48, 0 is not between, so no collision at start. Good.\n\nI need to go to y=9, which is above, so I should move up.\n\nBut I have to go through y=6,7,8.\n\ny=6,7,8 have cars.\n\nAlso, I might stay or move down, but moving down would take me away, so probably not useful.\n\nMinimal turns: since I need to go from y=5 to y=9, that's 4 steps up, so theoretically H=4 turns, if I can go up each time without collision.\n\nBut I need to check if that's possible.\n\nSo, from t=16, I start at y=5.\n\nAt turn T, I choose action, which determines y_{T+1}.\n\nLet me define the turn sequence.\n\nSet t = 0 relative to t1, so let τ = t - 16, so at τ=0, y=5.\n\nI need to reach y=9 at some turn, say at τ=H, so after H actions, I am at y_{16+H}.\n\nI need y_{16+H} =9, and I start at τ=0, y=5.\n\nAfter first action at τ=0 (turn 16), I move to new y at τ=1, and so on.\n\nAt each step τ, I am at position y_τ, for τ=0 to H, with y_0=5.\n\nAt time τ, I am on freeway y_τ (if between 1-8), and I must not have collision, meaning that for the car span on that freeway at time τ, 0 not in span.\n\nTime τ corresponds to turn t = 16 + τ.\n\nFor car spans, at time T = 16 + τ, Δt = τ.\n\nI need to find a sequence of actions for τ=0 to H-1, such that after H actions, y_H =9.\n\ny_τ is after τ actions? Let's clarify.\n\nAt τ=0, before any action, I am at y=5.\n\nAt turn t=16 + τ, I choose action a_{16+τ}, which determines y_{16+τ+1}.\n\nPerhaps better to think in terms of the turn number.\n\nAt turn T (starting from T=16), I am at position y_T.\n\nI choose action a_T, which sets y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy, with Δy based on a_T.\n\nAfter H turns, at turn T=16+H, I am at y_{16+H}, and I want y_{16+H} =9.\n\ny_{16+H} is after H actions from start.\n\nAt start, T=16, y=5.\n\nAfter one action at T=16, y_{17} is set.\n\nI need y_{16+H} =9 for some H.\n\nFor example, if I go up each turn, after 4 up actions: at T=16, y=5; after U at T=16, y_{17}=6; after U at T=17, y_{18}=7; U at T=18, y_{19}=8; U at T=19, y_{20}=9. So at T=20, y=9, so H=4 turns? Turns from T=16 to T=19, that's 4 actions: T=16,17,18,19.\n\nAfter action at T=19, y_{20}=9.\n\ny_{16+H} =9, so if H=4, y_{20}=9, yes.\n\nNow, I need to check for each position and time if there is collision.\n\nCollision at turn T if y_T between 1 and 8, and 0 in car span on freeway y_T at time T.\n\nFor T=16, I am at y=5, freeway 5.\n\nFreeway 5 car: span at T: since Δt = T-16, at T=16, Δt=0, span [37,48], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nIf I go up at T=16, to y=6 at T=17.\n\nBut at T=17, I am on y=6, freeway 6.\n\nNeed to check freeway 6 at time T=17.\n\nFirst, freeway 6 has two cars.\n\nFirst car: (48,37,right,12) span at T: [37 + 12Δt, 48 + 12Δt] with Δt = T-16.\n\nAt T=17, Δt=1, span [37+12=49, 48+12=60], so [49,60], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: (0,-11,right,12) span at T: [-11 + 12Δt, 0 + 12Δt]\n\nAt T=17, Δt=1, [-11+12=1, 0+12=12], so [1,12]\n\nIs 0 in [1,12]? 1 to 12, 0 <1, not included, so 0 not in [1,12]. So safe at T=17 on y=6.\n\nNow, if I go up again at T=17, to y=7 at T=18.\n\nAt T=18, I am on y=7, freeway 7.\n\nFreeway 7 has two cars.\n\nFirst: (12,1,right,6) span at T: [1 + 6Δt, 12 + 6Δt]\n\nSecond: (60,49,right,6) span: [49 + 6Δt, 60 + 6Δt]\n\nAt T=18, Δt=2.\n\nFirst car: [1 + 6*2, 12 + 6*2] = [1+12=13, 12+12=24], [13,24]\n\n0 not in.\n\nSecond car: [49 + 12, 60 + 12] = [61,72], 0 not in. Safe.\n\nNow, up at T=18 to y=8 at T=19.\n\nAt T=19, on y=8, freeway 8.\n\nFreeway 8 same as 7: cars (12,1,right,6) and (60,49,right,6)\n\nAt T=19, Δt=3.\n\nFirst car: [1 + 6*3, 12 + 6*3] = [1+18=19, 12+18=30], [19,30]\n\nSecond car: [49 + 6*3, 60 + 6*3] = [49+18=67, 60+18=78], [67,78]\n\n0 not in either, safe.\n\nThen at T=19, I go up to y=9 at T=20.\n\nAt T=20, I am on y=9, but y=9 is not a freeway, no cars, so no collision. And I reached y=9.\n\nSo in 4 turns, I can go directly up with no collisions?\n\nBut let's confirm the actions.\n\nAt turn T=16: action U, go to y=6 at T=17\n\nT=17: U, to y=7 at T=18\n\nT=18: U, to y=8 at T=19\n\nT=19: U, to y=9 at T=20\n\nAnd at each position, no collision.\n\nAt T=16, I was on y=5, safe.\n\nT=17 on y=6, safe.\n\nT=18 on y=7, safe.\n\nT=19 on y=8, safe.\n\nT=20 on y=9, done.\n\nH=4 turns, actions at T=16,17,18,19.\n\nBut the sequence is for t from t1 to t1+H-1, I think.\n\nThe answer should be actions for turn t1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nt1=16, so turns 16,17,18,19 with actions U,U,U,U.\n\nBut is there any issue?\n\nFreeway 6 at T=17: second car span [1,12], which includes x=0? 1 to 12, x=0 is not included since 1>0, so 0 not in [1,12], correct.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nBut freeway 6 has a car that was at (0,-11) at t=16, so at t=17, it moved to [1,12], so x=0 is not covered now.\n\nAt t=16, it was at [-11,0], so at t=16, on freeway 6, if I were there, but I wasn't.\n\nAt t=17, it's at [1,12], so x=0 is free.\n\nSimilarly, all seem fine.\n\nBut let me check if for y=8 at T=19.\n\nΔt=3, car spans [19,30] and [67,78], both away from 0.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), which I do at T=20.\n\nT=20, y=9, position (0,9).\n\nAnd H=4.\n\nBut is there a faster way? H=4 is the minimum since I need to move up 4 steps.\n\nI could stay or something, but that would take more turns, so H=4 should be minimal.\n\nBut let me double-check if there is any collision I missed.\n\nFreeway 7 at T=18: Δt=2, first car [1+12=13,12+12=24], [13,24], 0 not in.\n\nSecond [49+12=61,60+12=72], [61,72], no.\n\nBut what about freeway 1? I didn't go there, but since I'm not on it, no need.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nFreeway 6 at T=17: [49,60] and [1,12], both not containing 0.\n\n[1,12] from 1 to 12, 0 is less than 1, not included.\n\nUnless the interval is inclusive, but 0 not equal to 1, so not in.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nBut in the car list, for freeway 6, at t=16, there is a car at (0,-11,right,12), so at t=16, span [-11,0], so if I were on y=6 at t=16, collision, but I wasn't.\n\nAt t=17, it moved to [1,12], so safe.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 7, first car at t=16: [1,12], so at t=16, if on y=7, and 0 in span? [1,12], 1 to 12, 0 not in, so safe if I were there, but I'm not.\n\nAt t=17, Δt=1, first car: [1+6=7,12+6=18], [7,18], 0 not in.\n\nIn my plan, I am on y=7 at t=18, which is later.\n\nAt t=18, [13,24], as above.\n\nNow, but there is freeway 8, same.\n\nBut let me see if at any point when I am on a row, 0 is covered.\n\nPerhaps for y=6, at some times it is covered.\n\nFor example, at t=16, on y=6, 0 is in the second car span [-11,0], so if I were on y=6 at t=16, collision.\n\nBut in my path, I am on y=6 at t=17, not t=16.\n\nAt t=17, it's [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, when is 0 covered on y=6?\n\nThe second car span: [-11 + 12Δt, 12Δt]\n\nSet min <= 0 <= max: -11 +12Δt <= 0 <= 12Δt\n\nFrom -11 +12Δt <=0, 12Δt <=11, Δt <= 11/12 <1\n\nSince Δt integer, Δt=0, so only at t=16, Δt=0.\n\nAt Δt=0, -11 <=0<=0, 0=0, so included.\n\nFor Δt>=1, min = -11+12*1=1, max=12, so 1<=x<=12, 0 not included.\n\nSimilarly, for other rows.\n\nFreeway 7: first car span [1 + 6Δt, 12 + 6Δt]\n\nMin =1 +6Δt >=1, so 0 never in since min>=1.\n\nSecond car min=49+6Δt >=49>0, so never.\n\nFreeway 8 same.\n\nFreeway 1: car at [-29 +3Δt, -18 +3Δt]\n\nMin negative, but max negative for small Δt.\n\nSet min <=0<= max: -29 +3Δt <=0 <= -18 +3Δt\n\nFrom 0 <= -18 +3Δt, 3Δt >=18, Δt >=6\n\nAnd -29 +3Δt <=0, 3Δt <=29, Δt <=29/3=9.666, so Δt=6 to 9.\n\nAt Δt=6, min=-29+18=-11, max=-18+18=0, so [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nΔt=7: min=-29+21=-8, max=-18+21=3, [-8,3], 0 in.\n\nΔt=8: min=-29+24=-5, max=-18+24=6, [-5,6], 0 in.\n\nΔt=9: min=-29+27=-2, max=-18+27=9, [-2,9], 0 in.\n\nΔt=10: min=-29+30=1, max=-18+30=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo on freeway 1, collision at Δt=6,7,8,9, i.e., t=22,23,24,25.\n\nBut I'm not going to freeway 1, so irrelevant.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways.\n\nFreeway 2,3,4,5: car [37+12Δt, 48+12Δt], min=37>0, so never contains 0, since min>=37>0.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6: first car same, [37+12Δt,48+12Δt] min>=37>0, never.\n\nSecond car as above, only at Δt=0.\n\nFreeway 7 and 8: min for cars at least 1, so 0 never in.\n\nSo actually, the only time when 0 is covered is on freeway 1 at t=22 to 25, and on freeway 6 at t=16.\n\nBut since I start at y=5, and go up, I don't encounter any collision in the direct path.\n\nTherefore, with H=4, actions U,U,U,U at turns 16,17,18,19.\n\nBut the player reaches y=9 at turn 20.\n\nNow, the answer should be the sequence of actions.\n\nBut let me confirm the format.\n\nAnswer format: Turn t1: a_{t1} etc.\n\nSo for turn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nAnd H=4.\n\nBut the problem says \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence\", and H is the number of turns, I think.\n\nIn the sequence, it should be from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nYes.\n\nBut is there a way with H=3? That would mean moving up 4 steps in 3 turns, but since each action changes y by at most 1, from y=5 to y=9, I need at least 4 actions, so H=4 is minimum.\n\nIf I start by staying or something, but that would increase H, so no.\n\nTherefore, this should be fine.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 6, it has two cars, but I think I handled.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if I need to wait or something, but not necessary.\n\nAnother thing: at turn T, when I move, I am on y_T at time T, and I move to y_{T+1} at next turn.\n\nIn the collision, only when on the freeway at that turn.\n\nIn this case, all clear.\n\nPerhaps for y=8 at t=19, but I already checked.\n\nBut let me see freeway 8 at different times.\n\nFor example, at t=16, on freeway 8: cars [1,12] and [49,60], no 0.\n\nt=17: [7,18] and [55,66], no.\n\nt=18: [13,24] and [61,72], no.\n\nt=19: [19,30] and [67,78], no.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nSo I think it's possible with H=4.\n\nBut the problem might be that for freeway 6, at t=16, it has a car at [ -11,0 ], but I am not there.\n\nAt t=17, when I am there, it's [1,12], so fine.\n\nPerhaps I should output the sequence.\n\nBut the answer should be in a box.\n\nBut let me see if I can reach faster, but no.\n\nPerhaps by moving down, but that would take longer.\n\nFor example, if I go down to y=4 or something, but y=4 is freeway 4, which has a car, but span [37+12Δt,48+12Δt], never near 0, so safe, but going down then up would take more turns.\n\nSimilarly, not needed.\n\nSo minimal H=4.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is:\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nIn the answer format.\n\nBut the player position is given as (0, y_{t1}), and t1=16, y=5.\n\nNow, to write the answer.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 6, it says (48,37,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12), but at t=16, (0,-11) means head at 0, tail at -11, so span [-11,0] for right-moving? Earlier I said [τ,h] = [-11,0].\n\nYes.\n\nAnd for the direction, it says \"direction d\", and for freeway 1, it's right, but head and tail: h=-18, τ=-29, and since right, τ < h? -29 < -18, so [τ,h] = [-29,-18], which is left of zero, moving right, so to increasing x.\n\nSimilarly, all seem consistent.\n\nPerhaps I should compute the span at t=16 for each.\n\nBut I think it's fine.\n\nSo I believe the minimal H is 4 with all U actions.\n</think>\nThe goal is to reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 5) at turn \\(t_1 = 16\\) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\), avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\nThe car spans at each turn are computed relative to \\(t_1 = 16\\), with \\(\\Delta t = T - 16\\) for turn \\(T\\). Collision occurs at turn \\(T\\) only if the player is on a freeway \\(y_T\\) (where \\(1 \\leq y_T \\leq 8\\)) and the position \\(x = 0\\) is within the span of any car on that freeway at turn \\(T\\).\n\nThe direct upward path from \\(y = 5\\) to \\(y = 9\\) requires 4 moves (each increasing \\(y\\) by 1), so the theoretical minimum \\(H = 4\\). The sequence of actions is tested for collisions at each turn:\n\n- **Turn 16 (\\(T = 16\\), \\(\\Delta t = 0\\)):** Player at \\(y = 5\\) (freeway 5).  \n  Freeway 5 car: \\((48, 37, \\text{right}, 12)\\), span at \\(T=16\\): \\([37 + 12 \\cdot 0, 48 + 12 \\cdot 0] = [37, 48]\\). \\(0 \\notin [37, 48]\\), no collision. Action: U, moving to \\(y=6\\) at turn 17.\n\n- **Turn 17 (\\(T = 17\\), \\(\\Delta t = 1\\)):** Player at \\(y = 6\\) (freeway 6).  \n  Freeway 6 cars:  \n  - \\((48, 37, \\text{right}, 12)\\): \\([37 + 12 \\cdot 1, 48 + 12 \\cdot 1] = [49, 60]\\), \\(0 \\notin [49, 60]\\).  \n  - \\((0, -11, \\text{right}, 12)\\): \\([-11 + 12 \\cdot 1, 0 + 12 \\cdot 1] = [1, 12]\\), \\(0 \\notin [1, 12]\\).  \n  No collision. Action: U, moving to \\(y=7\\) at turn 18.\n\n- **Turn 18 (\\(T = 18\\), \\(\\Delta t = 2\\)):** Player at \\(y = 7\\) (freeway 7).  \n  Freeway 7 cars:  \n  - \\((12, 1, \\text{right}, 6)\\): \\([1 + 6 \\cdot 2, 12 + 6 \\cdot 2] = [13, 24]\\), \\(0 \\notin [13, 24]\\).  \n  - \\((60, 49, \\text{right}, 6)\\): \\([49 + 6 \\cdot 2, 60 + 6 \\cdot 2] = [61, 72]\\), \\(0 \\notin [61, 72]\\).  \n  No collision. Action: U, moving to \\(y=8\\) at turn 19.\n\n- **Turn 19 (\\(T = 19\\), \\(\\Delta t = 3\\)):** Player at \\(y = 8\\) (freeway 8).  \n  Freeway 8 cars:  \n  - \\((12, 1, \\text{right}, 6)\\): \\([1 + 6 \\cdot 3, 12 + 6 \\cdot 3] = [19, 30]\\), \\(0 \\notin [19, 30]\\).  \n  - \\((60, 49, \\text{right}, 6)\\): \\([49 + 6 \\cdot 3, 60 + 6 \\cdot 3] = [67, 78]\\), \\(0 \\notin [67, 78]\\).  \n  No collision. Action: U, moving to \\(y=9\\) at turn 20.\n\nAt turn 20, the player reaches \\(y = 9\\). Since \\(y = 9\\) is not a freeway (cars only on \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\)), no collision check is needed, and the position (0, 9) is achieved.\n\nThis path has no collisions and uses \\(H = 4\\) turns, which is minimal because moving from \\(y = 5\\) to \\(y = 9\\) requires at least 4 upward moves. No shorter sequence is possible, and alternative paths (e.g., moving down or staying) would increase \\(H\\).\n\nThe sequence of actions for turns \\(t_1\\) to \\(t_1 + H - 1\\) (i.e., turns 16 to 19) is all U (up).\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 16: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 17: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 18: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 19: \\text{ U} }",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,6) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible without colliding with any cars. The cars are on freeways y=1 to y=8, and I'm starting at y=6. Collision happens only if at turn T, I'm on a freeway y_T and there's a car on that freeway where 0 is in its span at that exact turn.\n\nFirst, I should understand where the cars are at each future turn. The current turn is t1=17. I need to find actions from t=17 onwards.\n\nLet me denote the turns starting from t=17. So at turn t (relative to t1=17), the absolute turn is 17 + t, but since the car movements depend on the difference from t1, I'll work in terms of delta t = t - 17. So for delta t, the turn is 17 + delta t.\n\nThe car positions at time T (absolute) are given by:\n\nFor a car with initial head h, tail tau, direction d, speed s at t1=17:\n\nIf left-moving, span at T is [h - s(T-17), tau - s(T-17)]\n\nBut looking at the car state, all cars seem to be right-moving? Let me check.\n\nFreeway 1: (-15, -26, right, 3) — head -15, tail -26? That seems odd because for right-moving, head should be greater than tail? Let me read the definition.\n\nFor right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [tau, h] -> Span(T) = [tau + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\"\n\nIt says for right-moving, span is [tau, h] with tau < h, I assume, since it's moving right.\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 1: (-15, -26, right, 3)\n\n-15 and -26, with right direction. Since it's right-moving, span should be [tau, h] = [-26, -15]? But -26 < -15, so [tau, h] = [-26, -15], meaning tail at -26, head at -15.\n\nThen at time T, span is [tau + s(T-17), h + s(T-17)] = [-26 + 3(T-17), -15 + 3(T-17)]\n\nSimilarly, for other freeways.\n\nFreeway 6 has two cars: (60,49,right,12) and (12,1,right,12)\n\nFirst car: (60,49,right,12) — span [49,60]? tail=49, head=60? But 49<60, so [tau, h] = [49,60]\n\nAt T, [49 + 12(T-17), 60 + 12(T-17)]\n\nSecond car: (12,1,right,12) — [1,12] at t1, so at T: [1 + 12(T-17), 12 + 12(T-17)]\n\nFreeway 7: (18,7,right,6) and (-48,-59,right,6)\n\nFirst: [7,18] at t1, at T: [7 + 6(T-17), 18 + 6(T-17)]\n\nSecond: [-59,-48] at t1? tail=-59, head=-48, so [tau,h] = [-59,-48], at T: [-59 + 6(T-17), -48 + 6(T-17)]\n\nSimilarly for freeway 8, same as 7? It says: freeway 8: (18,7,right,6), (-48,-59,right,6) — identical to freeway 7? Probably different freeways, but same car configurations.\n\nFreeway 2,3,4,5 all have (60,49,right,12) — single car each.\n\nFreeway 6 has two cars.\n\nNow, collision occurs if at turn T, when I am on freeway y_T, and for some car on that freeway, 0 is in the span at that turn.\n\nAlso, when I move, at turn T, I am on y_T, and I decide action to go to y_{T+1}. But the position change happens at the end of the turn, I think.\n\nFrom the player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t based on a_t.\n\nSo at the start of turn t, position is (0, y_t). Then I choose action a_t, which determines Delta y_t, so at the end of turn t, position is (0, y_{t+1}).\n\nBut for collision, it says: \"collision occurs at turn T only if 0 in Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd y_T is the position at the start of turn T, I think.\n\nLet me read carefully.\n\n\"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd y_T is the vertical position at the start of turn T.\n\nThen, when I am at position (0, y_T) at start of turn T, and if I am on a freeway row (y=1 to 8), and there is a car on that row with 0 in its span at time T, then collision.\n\nNote that if I move to a different row, at turn T I am still on y_T, and I will be on y_{T+1} only at the start of next turn.\n\nThe note says: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nSo, at turn T, you are on y_T, and you only care about cars on y_T at time T.\n\nIf you move, at turn T+1 you are on y_{T+1}, and care about cars on y_{T+1} at time T+1.\n\nNow, I start at t=17, y=6, which is a freeway row.\n\nI need to reach y=9, which is not a freeway, so no cars there. y=9 is safe.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nBut I start at y=6, need to go to y=9.\n\nSince I can only move up, down, or stay, and I'm at y=6, to go to y=9, I need to move up three times, but I have to avoid cars on rows y=6,7,8 during the turns when I am on those rows.\n\ny=6,7,8 are freeways, so I need to be careful when I am on them.\n\nAlso, I can stay or move down, but moving down would take me away from y=9, so probably not useful since I want minimal turns.\n\nMinimal H: since I need to go from 6 to 9, the minimum possible is 3 turns if I move up each time: U,U,U to go to y=7,8,9.\n\nBut I need to check if at any point I collide with cars.\n\nSo let's simulate that.\n\nAt turn t=17, I start at y=6.\n\nI choose action a_17. If I choose U, then at end of turn, y_18 = 7.\n\nBut for collision, at each turn, when I am on a row, I check for that row at that turn.\n\nSo at turn t=17, I am on y=6. I need to check if there is a car on freeway 6 at time t=17 with 0 in span.\n\nFreeway 6 has two cars at t1=17:\n\nFirst car: (60,49,right,12) — span at T=17: [49 + 12(0), 60 + 12(0)] = [49,60], since T-17=0.\n\n0 is not between 49 and 60, so no.\n\nSecond car: (12,1,right,12) — span [1,12] at T=17. 0 is not in [1,12], since 1>0.\n\nSo at t=17, on y=6, no collision if I am there.\n\nNow, if I choose U at t=17, I move to y=7 at start of t=18.\n\nAt t=18, I am on y=7.\n\nNow, check freeway 7 at time T=18.\n\nT=18, delta t = 1.\n\nCars on freeway 7:\n\nFirst car: (18,7,right,6) at t1=17, span at T=17: [7,18]\n\nAt T=18, [7 + 6(1), 18 + 6(1)] = [13,24]\n\n0 not in [13,24].\n\nSecond car: (-48,-59,right,6) at t1=17, span at T=17: [-59,-48]\n\nAt T=18, [-59 + 6(1), -48 + 6(1)] = [-53,-42]\n\n0 not in [-53,-42].\n\nSo at t=18, y=7, no collision.\n\nThen I choose U again at t=18, go to y=8 at start of t=19.\n\nAt t=19, on y=8.\n\nCheck freeway 8 at T=19.\n\nFreeway 8 cars: same as freeway 7, (18,7,right,6) and (-48,-59,right,6)\n\nAt T=19, delta t=2.\n\nFirst car: [7 + 6(2), 18 + 6(2)] = [7+12, 18+12] = [19,30]\n\n0 not in [19,30]\n\nSecond car: [-59 + 6(2), -48 + 6(2)] = [-59+12, -48+12] = [-47,-36]\n\n0 not in [-47,-36]\n\nSo no collision.\n\nThen at t=19, I choose U, go to y=9 at start of t=20.\n\ny=9 has no cars, so I am done.\n\nH=3 turns: actions at t=17,18,19: U,U,U.\n\nBut at turn t=19, I am on y=8, then after action U, I go to y=9 at start of t=20.\n\nBut the position y_t is at start of turn t.\n\nAt start of t=20, y=9, which is the goal.\n\nThe sequence should be until I reach y=9 at some turn.\n\nIn this case, after 3 actions, at turn t=20, y=9.\n\nThe actions are for turns t=17 to t=19.\n\nH is the number of turns, I think the number of actions.\n\n\"sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1\" and y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nIn this case, t1=17, actions at t=17,18,19 (t=0,1,2 relative), and y_{17+3-1} = y_{19}? Let's see.\n\nt from 0 to H-1: actions at t1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nAfter H actions, the position is y_{t1 + H}.\n\nWe start at y_{t1} at start of turn t1.\n\nAfter action a_{t1}, at start of turn t1+1, position y_{t1+1}.\n\n...\n\nAfter action a_{t1 + k}, at start of turn t1 + k +1, position y_{t1 + k +1}.\n\nWe want y_{t1 + H} =9? No.\n\nThe position after H actions: after H actions, we have performed H steps, so at start of turn t1 + H, position y_{t1 + H}.\n\nWe want y_{t1 + H} =9.\n\nIn the minimal path, with U,U,U:\n\nAt start t=17, y=6\n\nAfter a_17=U, at start t=18, y=7\n\nAfter a_18=U, at start t=19, y=8\n\nAfter a_19=U, at start t=20, y=9\n\nSo y_{20} =9, which is t1 + H =17 + H, so H=3.\n\nAnd y_{t1 + H -1} = y_{17+3-1} = y_{19} =8, which is not 9? Contradiction?\n\nI think I misread.\n\nThe problem says: \"reach (0,9)\", and \"y_{t1 + H -1} =9\"\n\nLet me read carefully.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAnd \"y_{t1 + H -1} =9\"\n\ny_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nIn my sequence, at t=19 (which is t1 + 2, since t1=17, t1+2=19), y=8.\n\nThen after action, at t=20, y=9.\n\nBut y_{t1 + H -1} should be 9.\n\nIf H=3, t1 + H -1 =17+3-1=19, y_{19} should be 9.\n\nBut in my case, y_{19}=8.\n\ny_{t} is position at start of turn t.\n\nAt start of turn 19, y=8.\n\nAfter action at turn 19, at start of turn 20, y=9.\n\nSo to have y_{t} =9 at start of turn t, I need to be at y=9 at the beginning of that turn.\n\nIn this case, with U,U,U, at start of turn 20, y=9.\n\nSo y_{20} =9.\n\nt1 + H -1 =17 + H -1 should be the turn when position is 9.\n\nSet 17 + H -1 = T, y_T=9.\n\nThen T=17+H-1, so H=T-16.\n\nFor example, if y_{20}=9, then T=20, so 17+H-1=20, thus H=4? 17+H-1=20, H=20-17+1=4.\n\nLet's solve: t1 + H -1 = T, y_T=9.\n\nt1=17, so 17 + H -1 = T, so T=16+H.\n\ny_T=9.\n\nIn my sequence, y_{20}=9, so T=20, thus 16+H=20, H=4.\n\nBut with three actions, I reach y=9 at turn 20.\n\nThe actions are at turns t=17,18,19.\n\nt from 0 to H-1, so for H=3, t=0,1,2: actions at 17,18,19.\n\nThen y_{t1 + H} = y_{17+3} = y_{20} =9.\n\nBut the condition is y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\ny_{t1 + H -1} = y_{17+3-1} = y_{19} =8 ≠9.\n\nInconsistency.\n\nI think there's a confusion in indexing.\n\nLet me read the problem.\n\n\"sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" so for t from 0 to H-1, actions at times t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\nAfter these H actions, the position is y_{t1 + H}.\n\nWe want to reach (0,9), so y_{t1 + H} =9.\n\nBut the problem says: \"y_{t1 + H -1} =9\"\n\nLet me see: \"such that y_{t1 + H -1} =9\"\n\nPerhaps it's a typo or I misread.\n\nIn the task: \"reach (0,9)\", and \"y_{t1 + H -1} =9\"\n\nBut in the dynamics, after actions, y_{t} is position at start of turn t.\n\nAfter action a_{t}, we get y_{t+1}.\n\nSo with actions from t1 to t1+H-1, we affect y_{t1+1} to y_{t1+H}.\n\nSpecifically, after a_{t1}, y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + Delta y_{t1}\n\nAfter a_{t1+1}, y_{t1+2} = y_{t1+1} + Delta y_{t1+1}\n\n...\n\nAfter a_{t1+H-1}, y_{t1+H} = y_{t1+H-1} + Delta y_{t1+H-1}\n\nWe want y_{t1+H} =9.\n\nBut the problem says y_{t1+H-1} =9.\n\nPerhaps it's a mistake.\n\nLet me read carefully.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\n\" such that y_{t1 + H -1} =9\"\n\ny_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nBut from above, y_{t1 + H -1} is the position before the last action.\n\nFor example, with H actions, y_{t1 + H -1} is at start of turn t1+H-1, and we apply action a_{t1+H-1} to get to y_{t1+H}.\n\nIf we want y_{t1+H-1} =9, that means at start of turn t1+H-1, we are already at 9, so we don't need to move, but we might need to stay or something.\n\nBut the goal is to reach (0,9), which could be at the start of a turn.\n\nIn this case, for y=9, no cars, so it's safe to be there.\n\nBut in my earlier plan, at turn t=19 start, y=8, then I move to y=9.\n\nBut if I want y_{19} =9, I need to be at y=9 at start of turn 19.\n\nBut I start at y=6 at turn 17.\n\nTo be at y=9 at turn 19, that means in two turns, from turn 17 to turn 19.\n\nFrom start turn 17 y=6, after one action, at turn 18 y=7 or 6 or 5, then after second action, at turn 19 y=8,7,6,9,8, or 7 depending on actions.\n\nFrom y=6, after one action, y can be 7 (U), 5 (D), or 6 (S).\n\nThen from there, after second action, to y=9.\n\nIf from y=7, U to 8, D to 6, S to 7, U to 8.\n\nTo reach y=9 from y=7 in one action? No, only if I can jump, but I can only change by +1,0,-1 per action.\n\nSo from y=7, after one action, I can be at y=8,7, or 6, not 9.\n\nSimilarly, from y=6, after two actions, the highest I can be is y=8: U then U, to y=8 at turn 19 start.\n\nOr U then S to y=7, etc.\n\nBut y=9 is not reachable in two actions from y=6.\n\nMinimum three actions to go from 6 to 9: each U increases by 1, so three U's to go to 7,8,9.\n\nAt turn 19 start, y=8, then after action U, at turn 20 start, y=9.\n\nSo y_{20} =9.\n\nTo have y_{19} =9, I would need to be at y=9 at start of turn 19, which requires that at turn 18, I was at y=8 or 9 or 10, but y<=9, so from y=8 at turn 18, U to y=9 at turn 19.\n\nBut at turn 18, I can be at y=8 only if from turn 17 y=6, I did U to y=7 at turn 18, then U to y=8 at turn 19? Let's timeline.\n\nTurn t=17 start: y=6\n\nAfter a_17: y_18 = y_17 + Delta a_17\n\nTurn t=18 start: y_18\n\nAfter a_18: y_19 = y_18 + Delta a_18\n\nTurn t=19 start: y_19\n\nAfter a_19: y_20 = y_19 + Delta a_19\n\nTo have y_19 =9, it must be that at turn 19 start, position is 9.\n\nThat means from turn 18 start, y_18, after action a_18, y_19=9.\n\nSo y_18 must be 8 or 9 or 10, but y=10 not possible, so y_18=8 or 9.\n\nIf y_18=9, then a_18=S or D, but to stay at 9, a_18=S, then y_19=9.\n\nIf y_18=8, a_18=U, y_19=9.\n\nBut y_18=9 at turn 18 start, which means from turn 17, y_17=6, after a_17, y_18=9, but from y=6, I can only go to 5,6,7, not 9 directly. Impossible to reach y=9 in one action from y=6.\n\nSimilarly, y_18=8 only if from y_17=7 or 8 or 9, but y_17=6, so from y_17=6, after a_17, y_18 can be 5,6,7.\n\nNot 8.\n\nSo the earliest I can be at y=9 is at turn 20 start, with three actions: U at t=17 to y_18=7, U at t=18 to y_19=8, U at t=19 to y_20=9.\n\nSo y_20=9.\n\nFor y_{t1 + H -1} =9, with t1=17, so 17 + H -1 = T where y_T=9.\n\nT=20, so 17+H-1=20, thus H=4.\n\nThen with H=4, actions at t=17,18,19,20? t from 0 to 3, actions at 17,18,19,20.\n\nBut after four actions, y_21= something.\n\nIf I do three actions, I reach y_20=9.\n\nWith H=4 actions, I could reach earlier or later, but minimum is three.\n\nBut with three actions, y_{t1 + H} = y_20=9, but the condition is y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nFor H=3, t1+H-1=17+3-1=19, y_19=8≠9.\n\nSo to satisfy y_{t1+H-1}=9, I need to be at 9 at an earlier turn.\n\nBut from above, I can't be at 9 before turn 20.\n\nUnless I start at 9, but I start at 6.\n\nPerhaps I can reach in fewer turns by moving faster, but I can't, only +1 per turn.\n\nOr by being at 9 at turn 19, but impossible.\n\nSo there must be a mistake in the problem statement or my understanding.\n\nPerhaps the \"turns\" include the starting point or something.\n\nAnother possibility: the position y_t is after the action or before.\n\nLet's read the player update: \"y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t\" based on a_t.\n\nSo y_{t+1} is set after action a_t.\n\nAt start of turn t, position y_t, choose a_t, then y_{t+1} is determined.\n\nSo at start of turn t+1, position is y_{t+1}.\n\nFor collision at turn T, we use y_T and Span(T).\n\nTo have y_T =9 for some T.\n\nWith start at t=17, y=6, the earliest T for y_T=9 is T=20, with y_20=9.\n\nThen for that, we need actions at t=17,18,19: a17=U, a18=U, a19=U.\n\nThen y_18=7, y_19=8, y_20=9.\n\nNow, the sequence should be for t from 0 to H-1, actions at t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nWith H=3, actions at 17,18,19, and y_{t1+H} = y_20=9, but the problem says y_{t1+H-1}=9, which is y_19=8, not 9.\n\nSo perhaps it's a typo, and it should be y_{t1+H} =9.\n\nOtherwise, it's impossible to have y_{t1+H-1}=9 with minimal turns.\n\nPerhaps for the goal, when we reach y=9, we don't care about the action, but the position.\n\nBut the condition is specified.\n\nLet's look back at the problem.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\", and \"y_{t1 + H -1} =9\"\n\nBut in this context, \"turns\" might mean the number of actions, and y_{t1+H-1} is the position after H-1 actions or something.\n\nAfter k actions, position is y_{t1+k}.\n\nAfter 0 actions, y_{t1} =6\n\nAfter 1 action, y_{t1+1}\n\nAfter 2 actions, y_{t1+2}\n\nAfter 3 actions, y_{t1+3} =20 for t1=17.\n\nWe want y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nFor example, after H-1 actions, position is 9.\n\nAfter H-1 actions, position y_{t1 + (H-1)} =9.\n\nThen with one more action, but we may not need it.\n\nFor instance, if after H-1 actions, we are at 9, then we can stop, but the sequence has H actions, including possibly S at the end.\n\nBut in this case, for y_{t1 + H -1} =9, that means at turn t1 + H -1, position is 9.\n\nWith t1=17, we need y_T=9 for some T.\n\nT=20 as above.\n\nSo y_20=9, so t1 + H -1 =20, 17 + H -1 =20, so H=4.\n\nThen with H=4, we need to have y_{17+4-1} = y_20=9.\n\nBut with H=4 actions, we can reach y_20=9 with three actions, and the fourth action could be at turn 20, but if we are at y_20=9, and we do a_20, we might move away or stay.\n\nBut to satisfy the sequence, we need to specify a_20.\n\nBut we can do a_20=S to stay at 9.\n\nBut that would be H=4, with one extra turn, not minimal.\n\nMinimal H should be 3 for the actions to reach, but with the condition, we have to set H=4.\n\nBut let's see if it's possible to reach earlier with the cars, but it's not, due to movement constraints.\n\nPerhaps for y=9, since no cars, we can be there at turn 19 if we start from higher, but we start from 6.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps at turn 17, if I do nothing, but I have to move.\n\nI think there might be a mistake in the problem statement or my understanding.\n\nPerhaps the \"turns\" include the initial state.\n\nBut let's assume that for the purpose of this problem, with the car positions given, the direct U,U,U is safe, as I checked earlier for turns 17,18,19 on rows 6,7,8.\n\nAt turn 17, y=6, no collision.\n\nTurn 18, y=7, no collision.\n\nTurn 19, y=8, no collision.\n\nThen at turn 20, y=9, safe.\n\nSo with three actions U,U,U at t=17,18,19.\n\nFor the answer, I should output the actions.\n\nBut to satisfy the format, with H=3.\n\nAnd y_{t1+H-1} = y_19=8, which is not 9, but the position at turn 20 is 9.\n\nPerhaps the problem meant that after H-1 actions, but let's look at the indices.\n\nI think I should proceed with the car avoidance.\n\nIn my initial check, for the direct path, it seems safe, but let's confirm the car positions for freeway 6 at turn 17.\n\nFreeway 6 at T=17:\n\nFirst car: (60,49,right,12), span at T=17: since T-17=0, [49,60], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: (12,1,right,12), span [1,12], 0 not in, 1>0.\n\nAt turn 18, y=7, freeway 7:\n\nCars: (18,7,right,6) at T=18, delta t=1, [7+6*1, 18+6*1] = [13,24], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: (-48,-59,right,6), [-59+6, -48+6] = [-53,-42], 0 not in.\n\nTurn 19, y=8, freeway 8 same as 7, at T=19, delta t=2, first car [7+12,18+12]=[19,30], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car [-59+12, -48+12]=[-47,-36], 0 not in.\n\nSo no issues.\n\nBut freeway 6 has two cars, and at turn 17, both spans away from 0.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut let's list all freeways to be thorough.\n\nFreeway 1: at T, span [-26 +3(T-17), -15 +3(T-17)]\n\n0 in span if -26 +3(dt) <= 0 <= -15 +3(dt) for some dt.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut for the direct path, we only care about the rows we visit at the times we are there.\n\nWe are on y=6 at t=17 only.\n\ny=7 at t=18 only.\n\ny=8 at t=19 only.\n\nAnd for those, as above, no collision.\n\nBut is there a car on freeway 6 that could have 0 at some other time? But we only care at the time we are on the row.\n\nFor example, at turn 17 on row 6, we care only about cars on row 6 at turn 17.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo it seems safe.\n\nBut the problem is to output the sequence.\n\nBut with the H issue.\n\nPerhaps for this case, since we start at y=6, which is freeway, and we need to leave, but in this case it's fine.\n\nBut let's see if I can reach faster, but I can't.\n\nPerhaps I can go directly, but with cars, maybe on some row at some time it is dangerous, but here not.\n\nAnother thing: freeway 6 has a car at (12,1,right,12) at t1=17, span [1,12], so at T=17, 0 not in, but if I were there at T=18, what happens?\n\nBut at T=18, for freeway 6, cars move.\n\nAt T=18, delta t=1, first car [49+12,60+12]=[61,72], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car [1+12,12+12]=[13,24], 0 not in.\n\nSo still safe.\n\nSimilarly, at T=19, [49+24,60+24]=[73,84], [1+24,12+24]=[25,36], no.\n\nBut we are not on row 6 at those times.\n\nSimilarly for other rows.\n\nFreeway 7 at T=17: if I were there, but I am not at T=17.\n\nAt T=17, freeway 7: cars [7,18] and [-59,-48], 0 not in.\n\nBut I am at y=6 at T=17.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 3 with actions U,U,U at t=17,18,19.\n\nFor the answer, I think we should go with that.\n\nPerhaps the y_{t1+H-1} is a mistake, or perhaps in some contexts.\n\nMaybe for the last turn, but I think for the output, we can write the actions.\n\nBut let's see the answer format.\n\nIt should be like:\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nWith H=3.\n\nBut to confirm, let's see if there is any car that might cause issue at these points.\n\nFreeway 8 at T=19: as above, [19,30] and [-47,-36], 0 not in.\n\nBut there is freeway 8 with cars, but at T=19, safe.\n\nAnother thing: freeway 6 has a car at (12,1,right,12), which at some point might have 0.\n\nFor example, when [1 + 12(dt)] <= 0 <= 12 + 12(dt)\n\nSince moving right, at dt when 1 +12dt <=0 and 12+12dt >=0, but 1+12dt <=0 implies dt <= -1/12, impossible since dt>=0, so 1+12dt >=1>0, so 0 never in span for this car.\n\nSimilarly, the other car [49,60] always positive.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 1: [-26,-15] at dt=0, moving right, tau + s dt = -26 +3dt, h + s dt = -15 +3dt.\n\n0 in span if -26 +3dt <=0 <= -15 +3dt.\n\nSo -26 +3dt <=0 => 3dt <=26 => dt <= 26/3 ≈8.666, so dt<=8\n\nAnd 0 <= -15 +3dt => 3dt >=15 => dt>=5.\n\nSo for dt=5 to 8, 0 in span.\n\nAt T=17+5=22 to T=17+8=25, if on freeway 1, collision.\n\nBut we are not on freeway 1, so no issue.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways.\n\nFreeway 2,3,4,5: each has one car (60,49,right,12), span [49+12dt, 60+12dt], min 49>0, so 0 never in span.\n\nFreeway 6: as above, no 0 in span ever.\n\nFreeway 7: cars (18,7,right,6) and (-48,-59,right,6)\n\nFirst car: [7+6dt, 18+6dt], min 7>0, so 0 never in.\n\nSecond car: [-59+6dt, -48+6dt], 0 in if -59+6dt <=0 <= -48+6dt\n\n-59+6dt <=0 => 6dt <=59 => dt <= 59/6≈9.833, dt<=9\n\n0 <= -48+6dt => 6dt >=48 => dt>=8.\n\nSo for dt=8 to 9, T=25 to 26, 0 in span for second car on freeway 7.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 8, same cars, same times.\n\nBut we are not on these rows at those times, so fine.\n\nFor our path, no collision.\n\nTherefore, the minimal sequence is three actions: U at 17, U at 18, U at 19.\n\nSo for the answer.\n\nBut to write in the box.\n\nThe answer should be:\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nWith H=3.\n\nBut to match the format, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc.\n\nt1=17.\n\nSo I think that's it.\n\nBut the problem says \"avoiding collisions\", and in this case, it works.\n\nBut let's see if I can do it in less, but impossible.\n\nOr if I go down, but that would take more turns.\n\nSo minimal H=3.\n\nPerhaps for the output.\n\nAnother thing: at turn 19, when I am on y=8, and I move to y=9, but at turn 19, I am on y=8, and if there is a car at that time, but as above, no.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n</think>\nThe goal is to reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 6) at turn \\(t_1 = 17\\) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\nThe minimal number of turns required to move from \\(y = 6\\) to \\(y = 9\\) is 3, as each \"up\" action (U) increases the vertical position by 1, and the position must change sequentially.\n\n### Collision Check for the Sequence U, U, U:\n- **At turn 17 (start \\(y = 6\\)):**  \n  Freeway 6 has two cars:  \n  - Car 1: \\((60, 49, \\text{right}, 12)\\) → Span at \\(T = 17\\): \\([49, 60]\\) (0 not in span).  \n  - Car 2: \\((12, 1, \\text{right}, 12)\\) → Span at \\(T = 17\\): \\([1, 12]\\) (0 not in span).  \n  No collision. Action \\(a_{17} = U\\) moves to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 18.\n\n- **At turn 18 (start \\(y = 7\\)):**  \n  Freeway 7 has two cars:  \n  - Car 1: \\((18, 7, \\text{right}, 6)\\) → Span at \\(T = 18\\): \\([7 + 6(1), 18 + 6(1)] = [13, 24]\\) (0 not in span).  \n  - Car 2: \\((-48, -59, \\text{right}, 6)\\) → Span at \\(T = 18\\): \\([-59 + 6(1), -48 + 6(1)] = [-53, -42]\\) (0 not in span).  \n  No collision. Action \\(a_{18} = U\\) moves to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 19.\n\n- **At turn 19 (start \\(y = 8\\)):**  \n  Freeway 8 has two cars (identical to freeway 7):  \n  - Car 1: \\((18, 7, \\text{right}, 6)\\) → Span at \\(T = 19\\): \\([7 + 6(2), 18 + 6(2)] = [19, 30]\\) (0 not in span).  \n  - Car 2: \\((-48, -59, \\text{right}, 6)\\) → Span at \\(T = 19\\): \\([-59 + 6(2), -48 + 6(2)] = [-47, -36]\\) (0 not in span).  \n  No collision. Action \\(a_{19} = U\\) moves to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 20.\n\nAt turn 20, \\(y = 9\\), which is the goal and has no cars, so it is safe. The sequence reaches the goal in 3 actions with no collisions.\n\n### Minimal Turns \\(H\\):\n- \\(H = 3\\) (actions at turns 17, 18, and 19).\n- After the actions, \\(y_{t_1 + H} = y_{20} = 9\\), satisfying the reach condition. The requirement \\(y_{t_1 + H - 1} = y_{19} = 8\\) is not 9, but this is consistent with the movement dynamics, as \\(y_{20} = 9\\) is the position after the third action. The indexing in the problem likely intends for the position after \\(H\\) actions to be 9, so \\(H = 3\\) is minimal and correct.\n\nThe sequence of actions is:\n- Turn 17: U\n- Turn 18: U\n- Turn 19: U\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 17: \\text{ } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 18: \\text{ } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 19: \\text{ } U \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at position (0, 7) on turn t_1 = 18. The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the fewest turns possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing the y-position by +1, -1, or 0, respectively, and y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCollision occurs only if at some turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T where there's a car such that 0 is in its span at that exact turn. Importantly, when moving to a new row, you're not on that row until the next turn, so you don't collide with cars on the row you're moving to until you arrive.\n\nNow, let's look at the car states. For each freeway, there are cars with their positions and speeds. I need to compute where these cars are at future turns relative to t_1=18.\n\nThe car positions are given at turn t_1=18. For any future turn T, the span changes based on the direction and speed.\n\nSince the cars are moving, their positions shift over time.\n\nLet me denote Δt = T - t_1, so for turn T, Δt is the number of turns after t_1.\n\nFor a left-moving car (but in the table, direction is given as \"right\" or \"left\"? Let's see:\n\nIn the car state, it says \"direction d\", and in the examples, it's like \"right\" or \"left\". But in the update rules:\n\n- Left-moving: span moves left, so head decreases.\n\n- Right-moving: span moves right, so head increases.\n\nIn the car list:\n\nFor freeway 1: (-12, -23, right, 3) — so head h=-12, tail τ=-23, direction right, speed s=3.\n\nBut for right-moving, the span is [τ, h] because as it moves right, τ is left end, h is right end? Let's read carefully.\n\nThe update rule says:\n\n- Left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - sΔt, τ - sΔt]\n\n- Right-moving: Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + sΔt, h + sΔt]\n\nIn the notation, for right-moving, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed), but in the span definition for right-moving, it says Span(t_1) = [τ, h], so τ is the left end, h is the right end.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, Span(t_1) = [h, τ], so h is left end, τ is right end? I'm a bit confused.\n\nLet's clarify the notation.\n\nFrom the update rules:\n\nFor a left-moving car: at t_1, span is [h, τ], meaning from h to τ, and since it's moving left, both decrease.\n\nFor right-moving: at t_1, span is [τ, h], meaning from τ to h, and both increase when moving right.\n\nIn the car state table, it's listed as (head h, tail τ, direction, speed).\n\nFor example, freeway 1: (-12, -23, right, 3)\n\nSince direction is right, the span should be [τ, h] = [-23, -12], because τ is left end, h is right end for right-moving cars.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, if there was one, it would be [h, τ] with h left, τ right.\n\nBut in this case, all cars seem to be right-moving based on the data.\n\nLet's list all cars:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: h=-12, τ=-23, d=right, s=3 → so span at t_1: [τ, h] = [-23, -12]\n\nFreeway 2: (-48, -59, right, 12) → span at t_1: [-59, -48]\n\nFreeway 3: same as 2? (-48, -59, right, 12) → [-59, -48]\n\nFreeway 4: same (-48, -59, right, 12) → [-59, -48]\n\nFreeway 5: same (-48, -59, right, 12) → [-59, -48]\n\nFreeway 6: two cars: (-48, -59, right, 12) and (24, 13, right, 12)\n\nFirst car: [-59, -48], second car: for (24,13,right,12), span [τ,h] = [13,24]\n\nFreeway 7: (24,13,right,6) and (-42,-53,right,6)\n\nFirst: [13,24]? τ=13, h=24, so [13,24]\n\nSecond: τ=-53, h=-42, so [-53,-42]\n\nFreeway 8: same as 7: (24,13,right,6) → [13,24] and (-42,-53,right,6) → [-53,-42]\n\nNow, for collision: at turn T, if player is on freeway k, and for any car on that freeway, 0 is in the span at turn T.\n\nThat is, for some car, min(span) <= 0 <= max(span) at turn T.\n\nSince spans are intervals, 0 is in [left, right] if left <= 0 <= right.\n\nNow, for right-moving cars, span at T: [τ + sΔt, h + sΔt]\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but here all are right-moving, so only this case.\n\nΔt = T - t_1 = T - 18\n\nWe need to find when 0 is in the span for each car on each row.\n\nBut since player might be on different rows, we only care about the row the player is on at turn T.\n\nPlayer starts at y=7 at t=18.\n\nWe need to go to y=9, so we need to move up twice, from 7 to 8, then to 9.\n\nBut we can also move down or stay to avoid cars.\n\nSince we want minimal turns, probably we want to go up as fast as possible, but we have to avoid being on a row when a car is at x=0.\n\nNow, let's find for each row, at which turns a car is present at x=0.\n\nThat is, for each freeway k, and for each car on it, find the times when 0 is in its span.\n\nThen, for the player, when on row k at turn T, it collides if any car on row k has 0 in span at T.\n\nOtherwise safe.\n\nAlso, when moving, if at turn T you are on row k and move to row k', at turn T you are still on k, so you can be hit only by cars on k at T, and at T+1 you are on k', so hit by cars on k' at T+1.\n\nIn the note: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nThat means at the moment of moving, during the turn, you are on the starting row, and you arrive at the new row at the end of the turn or something? I think the turn update is discrete.\n\nLet me read the player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, so at turn t, you choose action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nSo, at the beginning of turn t, you are at y_t, you choose a_t, then at the beginning of turn t+1, you are at y_{t+1}.\n\nCollision is checked at turn T, meaning when you are at position y_T, and if on that row, a car is at x=0 at that same turn T.\n\nSo, for turn T, you are at y_T, and collision if for row y_T, there is a car with 0 in span at turn T.\n\nWhen you move, at turn T, you are at y_T, you choose action, which sets y_{T+1}, but during turn T, you are on row y_T, so collision depends only on row y_T at time T.\n\nThe note says that if you move to a different row at turn T, you are not on the new row until turn T+1, so you don't care about cars on the new row at turn T, only at turn T+1 if you are there.\n\nIn this case, since at turn T you are on y_T, you only check row y_T at time T for collision.\n\nSimilarly, at turn T+1, you are on y_{T+1}, check that row at T+1.\n\nNow, back to the cars.\n\nPlayer starts at t=18, y=7.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nSo possible actions: U, D, S.\n\nSince we want minimal H, we should try to go up as much as possible, but avoid rows when cars are at x=0.\n\nFirst, let's find for each row, the times when it is occupied, i.e., when there is a car at x=0.\n\nSince multiple cars per row, we need when at least one car has 0 in span.\n\nFor each car, find the interval of Δt where 0 is in span.\n\nThen for the row, it's occupied if any car is present at x=0 for that Δt.\n\nΔt = T - 18, T >=18.\n\nFor a right-moving car, span at T: [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt]\n\n0 in span if τ + s Δt <= 0 <= h + s Δt\n\nWhich is equivalent to:\n\n- τ + s Δt <= 0 => Δt <= -τ/s  (since s>0)\n\n- and 0 <= h + s Δt => Δt >= -h/s\n\nFrom τ + s Δt <= 0 <= h + s Δt\n\nSo:\n\nτ + s Δt <= 0 => s Δt <= -τ => Δt <= -τ/s\n\nand\n\n0 <= h + s Δt => -h/s <= Δt  (since s>0)\n\nSo Δt >= -h/s and Δt <= -τ/s\n\nSince for right-moving, τ is left end, h is right end, so τ < h usually, so -h/s < -τ/s, so the interval is [ -h/s , -τ/s ]\n\nSimilarly, if it were left-moving, but here all right.\n\nNow, τ and h are given, s given.\n\nFor example, freeway 1: car with τ=-23, h=-12, s=3\n\nSo Δt >= -(-12)/3 = 12/3 = 4\n\nΔt <= -(-23)/3 = 23/3 ≈ 7.666\n\nSince Δt integer, Δt from 4 to 7 inclusive? Let's see.\n\nΔt >= ceil(-h/s) and Δt <= floor(-τ/s)? Better to compute numerically.\n\n- h/s = -(-12)/3 = 12/3 = 4\n\n- τ/s = -(-23)/3 = 23/3 ≈ 7.666\n\nSo 0 in span when Δt >= 4 and Δt <= 7.666, so since Δt integer, Δt = 4,5,6,7\n\nBecause at Δt=4: τ + s Δt = -23 + 3*4 = -23+12= -11, h + s Δt = -12 +12=0, so [ -11, 0], 0 is included.\n\nAt Δt=5: -23+15= -8, -12+15=3, [ -8,3], 0 in\n\nAt Δt=6: -23+18= -5, -12+18=6, [-5,6], 0 in\n\nAt Δt=7: -23+21= -2, -12+21=9, [-2,9], 0 in\n\nAt Δt=8: -23+24=1, -12+24=12, [1,12], 0 not in\n\nAt Δt=3: -23+9= -14, -12+9= -3, [-14,-3], 0 not in\n\nSo Δt=4,5,6,7 for freeway 1 car.\n\nBut freeway 1 has only one car, so occupied when Δt=4,5,6,7.\n\nNow freeway 2: car (-48,-59,right,12), so τ=-59, h=-48, s=12\n\n- h/s = -(-48)/12 = 48/12 =4\n\n- τ/s = -(-59)/12 = 59/12 ≈4.916\n\nSo Δt >=4 and Δt <=4.916, so Δt=4? Since integer.\n\nΔt=4: τ + s Δt = -59 + 12*4 = -59+48= -11, h + s Δt = -48 + 48=0, so [-11,0], 0 in\n\nΔt=5: -59 +60=1, -48+60=12, [1,12], 0 not in\n\nΔt=3: -59+36= -23, -48+36= -12, [-23,-12], 0 not in\n\nSo only at Δt=4 for freeway 2.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same car, same as freeway 2, so only Δt=4 occupied.\n\nFreeway 4: same, only Δt=4.\n\nFreeway 5: same, only Δt=4.\n\nNow freeway 6: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (-48,-59,right,12) same as above, occupied at Δt=4\n\nSecond car: (24,13,right,12), h=24, τ=13, s=12\n\nFor this, τ=13, h=24, s=12\n\n- h/s = -24/12 = -2\n\n- τ/s = -13/12 ≈ -1.083\n\nSo Δt >= -h/s = -(-24)/12? Wait no.\n\nGeneral: Δt >= -h/s and Δt <= -τ/s\n\nh=24, so -h/s = -24/12 = -2\n\nτ=13, -τ/s = -13/12 ≈ -1.083\n\nSo Δt >= -2 and Δt <= -1.083\n\nSince Δt >=0, Δt >= -2 is always true for Δt>=0, and Δt <= -1.083, but -1.083 is negative, so no Δt satisfies? Let's see.\n\nΔt >= -h/s = -24/12 = -2\n\nΔt <= -τ/s = -13/12 ≈ -1.083\n\nBut Δt <= -1.083 and Δt >= -2, but Δt is integer >=0, so no non-negative Δt satisfies because -1.083 is negative.\n\nCheck when 0 in span.\n\nSpan at T: [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] = [13 + 12 Δt, 24 + 12 Δt]\n\nSince both positive and increasing, min is 13 +12Δt >0 for Δt>=0, so 0 not in span for any Δt>=0.\n\nSimilarly, at Δt=0: [13,24], 0 not in.\n\nSo this car never has 0 in span for T>=18.\n\nTherefore for freeway 6, only the first car matters, occupied at Δt=4.\n\nNow freeway 7: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (24,13,right,6) — h=24, τ=13, s=6\n\nτ=13, h=24, s=6\n\n- h/s = -24/6 = -4\n\n- τ/s = -13/6 ≈ -2.166\n\nΔt >= -4 and Δt <= -2.166\n\nAgain, Δt <= -2.166 <0, impossible, so never occupied.\n\nSpan: [13+6Δt, 24+6Δt] >0 for Δt>=0.\n\nSecond car: (-42,-53,right,6) τ=-53, h=-42, s=6\n\n- h/s = -(-42)/6 = 42/6 =7\n\n- τ/s = -(-53)/6 = 53/6 ≈8.833\n\nSo Δt >=7 and Δt <=8.833\n\nThus Δt=7,8\n\nAt Δt=7: τ + s Δt = -53 +42= -11? -53 +6*7= -53+42= -11\n\nh + s Δt= -42 +42=0, so [-11,0], 0 in\n\nΔt=8: -53+48= -5, -42+48=6, [-5,6], 0 in\n\nΔt=9: -53+54=1, -42+54=12, [1,12], 0 not in\n\nSo for second car, occupied at Δt=7 and 8.\n\nFirst car never, so freeway 7 occupied at Δt=7 and 8.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8: same cars as freeway 7, so also occupied at Δt=7 and 8.\n\nNow, freeway 1: occupied Δt=4,5,6,7\n\nFreeway 2: occupied Δt=4\n\nFreeway 3: Δt=4\n\nFreeway 4: Δt=4\n\nFreeway 5: Δt=4\n\nFreeway 6: Δt=4\n\nFreeway 7: Δt=7,8\n\nFreeway 8: Δt=7,8\n\nPlayer starts at y=7 at t=18, Δt=0.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\ny=9 is the goal, but freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=9 should be safe, no cars.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 might be safe, but we start at y=7.\n\nMinimal turns: from y=7 to y=9, need at least 2 turns if we go up twice.\n\nBut we have to avoid being on a row when it is occupied.\n\nAt turn t=18, Δt=0, player at y=7.\n\nIs y=7 occupied at Δt=0?\n\nFreeway 7: at Δt=0, cars: first car [13,24], not at 0; second car [-53,-42], not at 0. So no car at x=0, so safe to be at y=7 at t=18.\n\nNow, we need to reach y=9.\n\nPossible to go up to y=8 at next turn, or stay, or down.\n\nBut down might not help, since we need to go up eventually.\n\nSimilarly, staying might be needed to avoid.\n\nFirst, let's list the occupation times:\n\nFor each row, the Δt when it is occupied (i.e., car at x=0)\n\ny=1: occupied at Δt=4,5,6,7\n\ny=2: at Δt=4\n\ny=3: at Δt=4\n\ny=4: at Δt=4\n\ny=5: at Δt=4\n\ny=6: at Δt=4\n\ny=7: at Δt=7,8\n\ny=8: at Δt=7,8\n\ny=0 and y=9: no cars, always safe.\n\nPlayer at t=18 (Δt=0), y=7, safe.\n\nWe need to be at y=9 at some turn.\n\nSince we start at y=7, we can go to y=8, then to y=9.\n\nBut we need to be safe at each position.\n\nAt turn T, when we are at y_T, it must not be occupied.\n\nAlso, when we move, the action is chosen at turn T to go to y_{T+1}.\n\nLet's consider moving up immediately.\n\nOption 1: At t=18, action U, so y_{19} = 7 +1 =8\n\nThen at turn t=19, we are at y=8.\n\nNow t=19, Δt =19-18=1\n\nAt Δt=1, is y=8 occupied?\n\ny=8 occupied at Δt=7,8, not at Δt=1, since Δt=1 not in {7,8}, so safe.\n\nThen at t=19, we can choose action U to go to y=9.\n\ny_{20} =8+1=9\n\nAt turn t=20, we are at y=9, which is safe, no cars.\n\nNow, check if at any point collision.\n\nAt t=18: y=7, Δt=0, not occupied (as above)\n\nAt t=19: y=8, Δt=1, not occupied (y=8 occupied only at 7,8)\n\nAt t=20: y=9, safe.\n\nSo we reach y=9 at turn t=20, with H=2 turns? From t=18 to t=20, actions at t=18 and t=19.\n\nt_1=18, we need sequence from t=18 to t=18+H-1, and at t=18+H-1, y=9.\n\nIn this case, at t=18: action U, go to y=8 at t=19\n\nAt t=19: action U, go to y=9 at t=20\n\nSo at turn t=20, y=9, so H-1 = 20 -18? Let's see.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =20, t_1=18, so 18 + H -1 =20, thus H-1=2, H=3.\n\nTurns: t=18,19,20; three turns, actions at t=18,19,20? No.\n\nThe sequence is actions from t=18 to t=18+H-1, and after H actions, we are at y=9 at time t=18+H.\n\nDefine:\n\nAt time t, before action, position y_t.\n\nAfter action a_t, y_{t+1} = y_t + delta.\n\nWe start at t=18, y_18=7.\n\nAfter H actions, at time t=18+H, y_{18+H} should be 9.\n\nThe actions are from t=18 to t=18+H-1.\n\nAt turn t=18+H-1, we perform the last action to set y_{18+H} =9.\n\nIn the answer, we list actions for turn t_1 to t_1 + H-1.\n\nIn this case, with two actions: at t=18: U, then y_19=8\n\nAt t=19: U, then y_20=9\n\nSo at t=20, y=9, so H=2, actions at t=18 and t=19.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =19, so for H=2, t_1 + H -1 =18+2-1=19.\n\nYes, actions at t=18 and t=19.\n\nAnd at t=20, position is (0,9).\n\nIn this path, we were at:\n\nt=18: y=7, safe\n\nt=19: y=8, safe as above\n\nNo collision.\n\nIs this minimal? H=2, which is the minimum possible since we need to increase y by 2.\n\nBut is y=8 safe at Δt=1?\n\nΔt = T - 18, at T=19, Δt=1.\n\ny=8 occupied only at Δt=7 and 8, which are T=25 and 26, not at T=19.\n\nSimilarly, y=7 at T=18, Δt=0, not occupied.\n\nSo yes.\n\nBut let's confirm freeway 7 and 8 at Δt=1.\n\nFreeway 7 at Δt=1: cars? First car: [13+6*1, 24+6*1] = [19,30], not at 0.\n\nSecond car: [-53 +6*1, -42 +6*1] = [-47,-36], not at 0. So safe.\n\nFreeway 8 same.\n\nSo this should work.\n\nBut the player starts at y=7, and we go directly to y=8 and y=9.\n\nBut in freeway 6, there was a car at Δt=4, but we are not on y=6.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nBut H=2 seems possible.\n\nBut let me see if there is any issue.\n\nThe car on freeway 6 at Δt=4, but that's at T=22, we are at y=9 by then.\n\nSimilarly, y=7 occupied at Δt=7,8, T=25,26.\n\nNo problem.\n\nSo with actions: at turn 18: U, then at turn 19: U.\n\nBut at turn 19, we are at y=8, and we go to y=9.\n\nIn the sequence, we need to list actions.\n\nBut the answer should be minimal H, which is 2.\n\nBut let me see the car states again.\n\nFreeway 6 has two cars, but one is never at 0, so only Δt=4.\n\nBut at Δt=4, T=22, we are fine.\n\nPerhaps I should list for all rows to be sure.\n\ny=1: occupied Δt=4,5,6,7 → T=22,23,24,25\n\ny=2: Δt=4 → T=22\n\ny=3: T=22\n\ny=4: T=22\n\ny=5: T=22\n\ny=6: T=22\n\ny=7: Δt=7,8 → T=25,26\n\ny=8: T=25,26\n\nAt T=18, Δt=0: all rows safe except possibly, but y=7 is safe, as above.\n\nT=19, Δt=1: all rows should be safe since no occupation at Δt=1 for any.\n\ny=1 at Δt=1: not occupied, since occupied starting at 4.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nSo yes.\n\nBut the player is only on y=7 at T=18 and y=8 at T=19, both safe.\n\nThen at T=20, y=9, safe.\n\nSo H=2.\n\nBut is there a reason to take more turns? Probably not, since we can go directly.\n\nPerhaps I misread the car on freeway 7 and 8.\n\nFreeway 7: cars at Δt=7,8 occupied, but at Δt=1, not.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nAnother thing: the second car on freeway 6 is (24,13,right,12), which I thought never at 0, but let's confirm.\n\nAt Δt=0: [13,24], 0 not in.\n\nAs Δt increases, both ends increase, so min is 13>0, so indeed never at 0.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 7 first car (24,13,right,6), same, [13+6Δt,24+6Δt] >0.\n\nSecond car (-42,-53,right,6), only at Δt=7,8.\n\nSo I think H=2 is possible.\n\nBut let's see the initial position: player at (0,7), and we move up.\n\nBut in the action sequence, only two actions.\n\nBut perhaps I should consider if we need to wait or something, but not necessary.\n\nMaybe for y=8, at some point, but at T=19, it's fine.\n\nPerhaps the minimal H is 2.\n\nBut let me see the answer format.\n\nWe need to output the sequence.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\"\n\nIn this case, H=2, actions: turn 18: U, turn 19: U.\n\nBut turn 19 is t_1 +1.\n\nt_1=18.\n\nSequence: turn t_1: U, turn t_1+1: U.\n\nThen at turn t_1+1 =19, after action, y=9? At turn t=19, we perform action, which sets y for t+1=20.\n\nAfter action at t=19, y_20=9.\n\nSo at time t=20, we are at (0,9).\n\nThe turn when we reach is t=20, but the last action is at t=19.\n\nIn terms of number of actions, H=2.\n\nPerhaps we can reach in one action? From y=7 to y=9? But actions only change by +1,0,-1, so impossible to jump, must take at least two actions to go from 7 to 9.\n\nSo H=2 is minimal.\n\nAnd we have a sequence that works.\n\nBut is there any car that might hit us during the move? But since collision is only at the position at the start of the turn, and we are not on intermediate positions, it should be fine.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if at T=19, when we are on y=8, it is safe, which it is.\n\nAnother thing: in freeway 6, there is a car at (24,13,right,12), but since it's right-moving, and we are at x=0, only when the span includes 0.\n\nBut at no time, as we said.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps for y=7, at Δt=0, is it safe? Cars on y=7: at T=18, Δt=0, first car position: since direction right, span [τ, h] = [13,24] for first car? Freeway 7: cars (24,13,right,6) and (-42,-53,right,6)\n\nFor (24,13,right,6): τ=13, h=24, so span [13,24]\n\nAt T=18, Δt=0, [13,24], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: τ=-53, h=-42, span [-53,-42], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, at T=19, Δt=1: [13+6,24+6]=[19,30] and [-53+6,-42+6]=[-47,-36], both not contain 0.\n\nSo safe.\n\nSimilarly for y=8 same cars.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nBut the problem has freeway 6 with two cars, but one is irrelevant.\n\nFreeway 8 same as 7.\n\nSo I think we can go directly.\n\nPerhaps the answer is H=2 with U,U.\n\nBut let me see if there is a constraint I missed.\n\nThe player position is (0,y), and cars are on the freeways, but when we are at y=9, no freeway, so safe.\n\ny=0 also safe, but we don't go there.\n\nSo I think it's ok.\n\nPerhaps at turn t=18, we could stay, but that would take more turns, not minimal.\n\nOr move down, worse.\n\nSo minimal is to go up twice.\n\nTherefore, the sequence should be:\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nWith H=2.\n\nBut in the sequence, for turn t_1 + t for t=0 to H-1, so t from 0 to 1, so turn 18 and 19.\n\nActions a_{18} and a_{19}.\n\nNow, in the answer format.\n\nBut let me write the boxed answer.\n\nBut I feel like maybe I missed something because the cars on other rows have occupations, but we are not there.\n\nPerhaps for y=8, at Δt=1, but it's not occupied.\n\nAnother point: the car on freeway 1 at Δt=4, but that's later.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nPerhaps the player must avoid being on a row when a car is passing, but in this case, no issue.\n\nSo I believe H=2 is achievable.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 7) at turn \\(t_1 = 18\\) and needs to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis:\n- The player must increase their \\(y\\)-coordinate from 7 to 9, requiring at least two \"U\" (up) actions, as each \"U\" increases \\(y\\) by 1.\n- Collision occurs only if, at turn \\(T\\), the player is on a freeway \\(y_T\\) and there exists a car on that freeway such that \\(0\\) is within its span at turn \\(T\\).\n- The car spans and their occupation times (when \\(0\\) is in the span) relative to \\(\\Delta t = T - 18\\) are:\n  - **Freeway 1**: Occupied at \\(\\Delta t = 4, 5, 6, 7\\) (turns 22, 23, 24, 25).\n  - **Freeway 2**: Occupied at \\(\\Delta t = 4\\) (turn 22).\n  - **Freeway 3**: Occupied at \\(\\Delta t = 4\\) (turn 22).\n  - **Freeway 4**: Occupied at \\(\\Delta t = 4\\) (turn 22).\n  - **Freeway 5**: Occupied at \\(\\Delta t = 4\\) (turn 22).\n  - **Freeway 6**: Occupied at \\(\\Delta t = 4\\) (turn 22) (only the first car matters; the second car never has 0 in its span).\n  - **Freeway 7**: Occupied at \\(\\Delta t = 7, 8\\) (turns 25, 26).\n  - **Freeway 8**: Occupied at \\(\\Delta t = 7, 8\\) (turns 25, 26).\n- Freeways \\(y = 0\\) and \\(y = 9\\) have no cars and are always safe.\n\n### Path to Reach (0, 9) in Minimal Turns:\n- At turn 18 (\\(\\Delta t = 0\\)): Player is at \\(y = 7\\).  \n  - Freeway 7 is not occupied (cars at [13, 24] and [-53, -42], neither contains 0).  \n  - Action: \"U\" to move to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 19.\n- At turn 19 (\\(\\Delta t = 1\\)): Player is at \\(y = 8\\).  \n  - Freeway 8 is not occupied (cars at [19, 30] and [-47, -36], neither contains 0).  \n  - Action: \"U\" to move to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 20.\n- At turn 20: Player is at \\(y = 9\\), which is safe (no cars).\n\nThis sequence uses \\(H = 2\\) actions (at turns 18 and 19) and reaches (0, 9) at turn 20.

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at position (0, 8) at turn t₁ = 19. The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nThe player moves vertically: U for up (y increases by 1), D for down (y decreases by 1), or S for stay (y stays the same). y must be between 0 and 9 inclusive.\n\nCars move horizontally on their freeways. For each car, given its position at turn t₁, I need to find where it is at future turns to avoid collisions.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if the player is on freeway y_T at that turn, and for that freeway, there's a car such that 0 (the x-coordinate) is within the car's span at that turn.\n\nImportant note: when you move to a new y at turn T, you are not on that new y until turn T+1. So at turn T, you are on y_T, and if you move, you change to y_{T+1} for the next turn. But for collision, at turn T, you are on y_T, so we only care about cars on y_T at that exact turn.\n\nThe car positions are given at turn t₁=19. For future turns, I need to compute their spans based on their movement.\n\nLet me list all the cars and their states at t₁=19.\n\nFor freeway y=1: one car, head h=-9, tail τ=-20, direction right, speed s=3.\n\nSince it's right-moving, the span is [τ, h] = [-20, -9] at t₁=19.\n\nDirection: right means it's moving to the right, so as time increases, the span shifts to higher x-values.\n\nThe update: for right-moving, span at T is [τ + s*(T-t₁), h + s*(T-t₁)]\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, it would be [h - s*(T-t₁), τ - s*(T-t₁)], but in this case, all cars seem to be right-moving? Let me check.\n\nLooking at the car state:\n\ny=1: (-9, -20, right, 3) — head and tail, so since direction right, head is at -9, tail at -20? But typically for right-moving, head might be the front, so if moving right, head should be at higher x, but here head=-9, tail=-20, and -9 > -20, so head is at x=-9, tail at x=-20, so the car extends from x=-20 to x=-9? But that might be inconsistent with the span definition.\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\nFor car k on freeway i, at turn t₁, head at h, tail at τ.\n\nThen for direction: left-moving or right-moving.\n\nIn the update:\n\nLeft-moving: span(t₁) = [h, τ] → span(T) = [h - s*(T-t₁), τ - s*(T-t₁)]\n\nRight-moving: span(t₁) = [τ, h] → span(T) = [τ + s*(T-t₁), h + s*(T-t₁)]\n\nIn the right-moving case, span(t₁) = [τ, h], so τ is the left end, h is the right end, so for right-moving, the car is from τ to h with τ < h, and it moves right, so positions increase.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, span(t₁) = [h, τ], which might imply h is left, τ is right or something? Let's see the notation.\n\nIn the left-moving update: span(t₁) = [h, τ] → [h - s*dt, τ - s*dt]\n\nSince it's moving left, x decreases.\n\nBut the order [h, τ] might not specify which is min or max, but from the context, for collision, we care if 0 is in the interval, so we need the min and max x of the car.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving, [τ, h] with τ and h, and from the values, for y=1, h=-9, τ=-20, and since right-moving, span is [τ, h] = [-20, -9] at t₁=19.\n\n-20 to -9, so min x = -20, max x = -9.\n\nAs it moves right, at time T, min x = τ + s*(T-19) = -20 + 3*(T-19)\n\nMax x = h + s*(T-19) = -9 + 3*(T-19)\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, y=2: (-36, -47, right, 12)\n\nRight-moving, so span at t₁: [τ, h] = [-47, -36]\n\nMin x = -47, max x = -36\n\nAt T, min x = -47 + 12*(T-19), max x = -36 + 12*(T-19)\n\ny=3: same as y=2? (-36, -47, right, 12) identical to y=2.\n\ny=4: same, (-36, -47, right, 12)\n\ny=5: same, (-36, -47, right, 12)\n\ny=6: two cars: (-36, -47, right, 12) and (36, 25, right, 12)\n\nFirst car: same as above, min x = -47, max x = -36 at t=19\n\nSecond car: (36, 25, right, 12), so head h=36, tail τ=25, right-moving, so span [τ, h] = [25, 36] at t=19? [25,36] min=25, max=36.\n\nBut direction right, so moving right.\n\nAt T, min x = 25 + 12*(T-19), max x = 36 + 12*(T-19)\n\ny=7: (30, 19, right, 6) and (-36, -47, right, 6)\n\nFirst car: (30,19,right,6), span [19,30] at t=19, min=19, max=30\n\nAt T, min x = 19 + 6*(T-19), max x = 30 + 6*(T-19)\n\nSecond car: (-36,-47,right,6), span [-47,-36] at t=19, min=-47, max=-36\n\nAt T, min x = -47 + 6*(T-19), max x = -36 + 6*(T-19)\n\ny=8: (30,19,right,6) and (-36,-47,right,6) same as y=7.\n\nNow, the player is at y=8 at turn t=19.\n\nGoal is to reach y=9, which is not a freeway, so no cars there. So once at y=9, no collision possible.\n\ny=9 is safe, no cars.\n\nBut we need to get to (0,9), so position (0,9).\n\nNow, since we start at y=8, and we need to go to y=9, which is one up.\n\nBut we might need to move to avoid cars on y=8 or other freeways if we don't go directly.\n\nBut since we're at y=8, and we want to go to y=9, we can just go up, but we need to check if at the time we are on y=8, whether there is a collision.\n\nMoreover, we might stay or move down to avoid, but since we want to minimize turns, probably going up directly is best, but let's see the car positions.\n\nFirst, at turn t=19, player is on y=8.\n\nOn y=8, there are two cars: one with min x=19, max x=30 at t=19, and one with min x=-47, max x=-36 at t=19.\n\nFor collision on y=8 at turn T, we need 0 to be in the span of some car on y=8.\n\nFirst car: min x = 19 + 6*(T-19), max x = 30 + 6*(T-19)\n\nSet min x <= 0 <= max x\n\n19 + 6dt <= 0 <= 30 + 6dt where dt = T-19\n\nSimilarly, second car: min x = -47 + 6dt, max x = -36 + 6dt\n\n-47 + 6dt <= 0 <= -36 + 6dt\n\nNow, for first car: 19 + 6dt <= 0 <= 30 + 6dt\n\nBut 19 + 6dt <=0 implies 6dt <= -19, dt <= -19/6 ≈ -3.166, but dt >=0 since T>=19, so 19 + 6dt >=19 >0, so min x >0 for all dt>=0, so 0 <= min x is false, since min x >=19 >0, so 0 cannot be <= max x when min x >0? Let's see the inequality.\n\n0 <= max x is true since max x >=30>0, but min x <=0 must hold for 0 to be in [min,max].\n\nmin x =19 +6dt >=19>0 for all dt>=0, so min x >0, thus 0 < min x, so 0 not in [min,max] for first car. No collision possible with first car on y=8.\n\nSecond car on y=8: min x = -47 +6dt, max x = -36 +6dt\n\n0 in [min x, max x] iff min x <=0 and max x >=0.\n\nmin x <=0: -47 +6dt <=0 => 6dt <=47 => dt <= 47/6 ≈ 7.833\n\nmax x >=0: -36 +6dt >=0 => 6dt >=36 => dt >=6\n\nSo for dt from 6 to 7.833, so T from 19+6=25 to 19+7=26? dt=6: T=25, dt=7: T=26\n\ndt=6: min x = -47 +6*6 = -47+36= -11, max x= -36+36=0? -36 + 6*6 = -36+36=0\n\nAt T=25, min x = -47 +6*(25-19) = -47 +6*6 = -47+36= -11\n\nmax x = -36 +6*6 = -36+36=0\n\nSo span [-11, 0] at T=25? min x <=0 and max x=0, so 0 is included since it's a closed interval, I assume.\n\nSimilarly, at T=26, dt=7, min x= -47 +42= -5, max x= -36+42=6, so [ -5,6] includes 0.\n\nAt T=27, dt=8, min x= -47+48=1, max x= -36+48=12, min x=1>0, so 0 not in [1,12].\n\nSo on y=8, collision possible at T=25 and T=26 for the second car.\n\nNow, player is at y=8 at turn t=19. If player stays on y=8 for turns, they might be at risk at T=25 and 26.\n\nBut at turn T, player is on y_T, so for collision at T on y=8, player must be on y=8 at that turn.\n\nNow, player can move to other y.\n\nBut we start at y=8, and want to go to y=9.\n\ny=9 is safe, no cars.\n\nSo the minimal might be to go up immediately.\n\nLet's see the actions.\n\nTurn t=19: player is at (0,8), on y=8.\n\nNow, to reach (0,9), we need to be at y=9 at some turn.\n\nSince we can move one step per turn, the minimal H should be 1, if we go up at turn 19 to reach y=9 at turn 20.\n\nBut at turn 19, we are on y=8, so we perform action at turn 19 to determine y_{20}.\n\nIf we do U at turn 19, then y_{20} = y_{19} +1 = 8+1=9.\n\nThen at turn 20, we are at (0,9), goal reached.\n\nNow, is there a collision during this?\n\nAt turn 19: player is on y=8.\n\nOn y=8 at t=19: cars spans.\n\nFirst car: min x=19, max x=30, both >0, 0 not in [19,30]\n\nSecond car: min x=-47, max x=-36, both <0, since -47 to -36, all negative, 0 not in [-47,-36], so no collision at t=19.\n\nThen at turn 20, player is at y=9, no cars, so no collision.\n\nSo with H=1, action at t=19: U, we reach (0,9) at turn 20.\n\nBut the sequence should be for t from t₁ to t₁+H-1, and we reach at turn t₁+H.\n\nt₁=19, H minimal turns, so actions from t=19 to t=19+H-1, and at turn t=19+H, we are at (0,9).\n\nIn this case, with one action: at t=19, do U, then at t=20, y=9.\n\nSo H=1.\n\nBut is there any issue? The car at y=8 might be a problem, but at t=19, no collision, and at t=20, we are on y=9, so no car there.\n\nBut let me confirm the car positions at t=19 for y=8.\n\ny=8 cars: (30,19,right,6) and (-36,-47,right,6)\n\nFirst: span [19,30], 0 not in.\n\nSecond: span [-47,-36], 0 not in.\n\nSo safe.\n\nPerhaps for other freeways, but since we move directly to y=9 in one step, we don't go through other y, so we only care about y=8 at t=19, which is safe.\n\nBut the player is at (0,8) at t=19, which is on y=8, and we act to go to y=9.\n\nIn the movement, when we move, at turn T, we are on y_T, and after action, we go to y_{T+1}.\n\nSo for collision, only at the turns we are on a freeway.\n\nHere, only at t=19 on y=8, and it's safe.\n\nThen at t=20 on y=9, safe.\n\nSo minimal H=1, action: U at t=19.\n\nBut the problem says \"reach (0,9)\", and we do at turn 20.\n\nBut let me make sure about the car on y=8 for future turns, but we don't stay, so it should be fine.\n\nPerhaps I should check if we can stay or something, but going up directly seems fastest.\n\nBut why is there a need for minimal H? If we can go up now, why not?\n\nBut let me see the other freeways, maybe for completeness.\n\ny=8 has cars that could be at 0 later, but we leave immediately.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways might have cars, but we don't go there.\n\nFor example, if we had to go through other y, but here we start at y=8, adjacent to y=9.\n\ny=8 and y=9, we can go up.\n\nBut y=9 is not a freeway, so no cars, safe.\n\nPerhaps the issue is that at turn 19, we are at y=8, and if we go up, we are fine.\n\nBut let me see the car state for other y, to see if there is any reason to not go directly.\n\nFor example, y=7 has cars.\n\nBut we don't go to y=7.\n\nSimilarly, y=6, etc.\n\nBut since we start at y=8 and go to y=9, no need.\n\nBut the player is at (0,8), and we need to reach (0,9), so vertical move.\n\nPerhaps I misread the position.\n\nThe grid is 2D, but player only moves vertically, and cars are on horizontal freeways, so x=0 is the position we care for collision.\n\nPlayer x is always 0, I think, since it says position (0, y_t), so x=0 fixed, only y changes.\n\nYes.\n\nSo for y=8 at t=19, safe to be there.\n\nAction U at t=19 to go to y=9 at t=20.\n\nBut let me confirm the turn numbering.\n\nTurn t=19: player at (0,8)\n\nAfter action a_{19}, y_{20} is set.\n\nThen at turn t=20, position (0,9), done.\n\nNow, is there a car on y=8 at t=19 that covers 0? No, as above.\n\nPerhaps for y=9, but no cars.\n\nBut let me see if at turn 19, if we do nothing, but we can go up.\n\nAnother thing: the car on y=8 might be moving, but at t=19, it doesn't cover 0.\n\nAnd since we leave, no issue.\n\nBut what about the sequence? The answer should be for turn t_1=19, action a_{19}.\n\nBut the problem says \"sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\", so for H=1, t from 0 to 0, so only a_{t_1 +0} = a_{19}\n\nThen at turn t_1 + H = 19+1=20, we are at (0,9).\n\nYes.\n\nBut let me double-check the car on y=8 for t=19.\n\ny=8 cars: one with [19,30], 19 to 30, 0 not in.\n\nOther with [-47,-36], all negative, 0 not in.\n\nYes.\n\nBut at t=19, for the second car, min x=-47, max x=-36, both <0, so 0 not in span.\n\nSimilarly, first car min=19>0.\n\nSo safe.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if we need to wait, but no need, since we can go up.\n\nBut let me see the other freeways quickly, to be thorough.\n\nFor example, y=7: cars at t=19: (30,19,right,6) so [19,30], and (-36,-47,right,6) so [-47,-36], neither contains 0.\n\nSimilarly, y=6: first car (-36,-47,right,12) so [-47,-36], and second (36,25,right,12) so [25,36], both not containing 0.\n\ny=5 to y=1 similar, all cars far away at t=19.\n\nBut since we don't go there, irrelevant.\n\nSo I think going up immediately is fine.\n\nBut the player is at y=8, and we go to y=9.\n\nBut y=8 is freeway, y=9 is not, so no issue.\n\nPerhaps the minimal H is 1.\n\nBut let me see the answer format.\n\nIt should be: Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\n\nIn this case, Turn 19: U\n\nBut H=1, so only one action.\n\nBut perhaps I need to output the sequence.\n\nBut for H=1, it's just one line.\n\nBut let me make sure about the collision rule.\n\nAnother point: the note says: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 in span(T) but not in span(T+1)\"\n\nBut in this case, at turn T, we are on y_T, and we move to y_{T+1}, so at turn T, we are only on y_T, not on y_{T+1}.\n\nIn our case, at t=19, we are on y=8, and we move to y=9, so at t=19, on y=8, no collision.\n\nAt t=20, on y=9, no cars.\n\nSo fine.\n\nPerhaps for y=9, but it's not a freeway, so no cars defined.\n\nI think it's correct.\n\nBut why are there multiple cars and freeways? Maybe for other starting positions, but here start at y=8.\n\nPerhaps I misread the position.\n\n\"Player Position: (0, 8)\" at turn t_1=19.\n\nYes.\n\nMaybe at turn 19, y=8 is safe, but if we stay, it might be dangerous later, but we don't stay.\n\nAnother thing: to reach (0,9), we need to be at y=9 at some turn.\n\nWith one up move, we get there at t=20.\n\nIf we do nothing, S, we stay at y=8 at t=20, then not at 9.\n\nOr down to y=7, which might be worse.\n\nSo up is best.\n\nBut let me check if y=9 is reachable directly.\n\ny=8 to y=9 with U.\n\nPerhaps the grid has y=0 to 9, so y=9 is valid.\n\nI think H=1 is possible.\n\nBut let me see the car on y=8 for t=19.\n\nThe second car is at [-47,-36], but speed 6, so it moves right.\n\nAt t=19, min x=-47, max x=-36.\n\nAs time increases, min x increases.\n\nAt dt=0, min=-47, max=-36\n\ndt=1, min=-41, max=-30\n\n...\n\nUntil around dt=6, min=-47+36=-11, max=-36+36=0\n\nAt dt=6, T=25, max x=0, so if player at y=8 and x=0 at T=25, collision.\n\nBut we are not there at that time.\n\nSimilarly, at t=19, we are safe.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nPerhaps for this specific setup, but I think going up now is safe and minimal.\n\nBut let me see if there is any constraint I missed.\n\nThe player must avoid collisions on freeways when on them.\n\nAt turn 19, on y=8, no collision.\n\nAction U, move to y=9 at turn 20.\n\nNo issue.\n\nPerhaps the answer is simply U at t=19.\n\nBut let me confirm the freeway indices.\n\nFreeways y=1 to 8 have cars, y=0 and y=9 no cars.\n\nPlayer at y=8, which has cars, but at t=19, safe.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n\nPerhaps I need to output the sequence.\n\nSo for H=1: Turn 19: U\n\nBut in the answer format, it should be \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" and so on.\n\nSince H=1, only one action.\n\nBut let me see the sequence index.\n\nThe actions are from t=0 to H-1 of the offset, so for t from t_1 to t_1+H-1.\n\nHere t_1=19, H=1, so only a_{19}\n\nThen at turn t_1 + H = 20, position.\n\nYes.\n\nBut the problem says \"reach (0,9)\", and with this, we do.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if we can reach faster, but H=1 is minimal possible, since we need to increase y by 1.\n\nUnless we are already at y=9, but we are at y=8.\n\nSo minimal H=1.\n\nSo I think the answer is to go up at turn 19.\n\nBut let me write it.\n\nSo the minimal number of turns H=1, and action: a_{19} = U\n\nSequence: Turn 19: U\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut the format says: Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\n\nSo for this case.\n\nBut I feel like it might be too straightforward, and perhaps I missed something with the cars.\n\nAnother thought: at turn 19, when we are at (0,8), and we do U, we move to (0,9) at turn 20.\n\nBut during the move, is there any intermediate position? No, the position is discrete per turn.\n\nCollision only checked at integer turns when on freeway.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nPerhaps for y=9, but no freeway.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nBut let me check y=7 and y=6, but we don't go there.\n\nFor example, if we were to go down, but that would take more turns to reach y=9.\n\nSimilarly, staying takes more turns.\n\nSo U is best.\n\nTherefore, the action is U at turn 19.\n\nSo the answer should be:\n\n\\boxed{ Turn 19: U }\n\nBut in the format, it might be with the turn specified.\n\nSince t_1 is given as 19.\n\nIn the answer, it should be \"Turn 19: a_{19}\" but since it's U, we write U.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nI think that's it.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 8) at turn \\(t_1 = 19\\). The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\), avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\nAt turn 19, the player is on freeway \\(y = 8\\). The cars on \\(y = 8\\) at turn 19 are:\n- Car 1: Span at turn 19 is \\([19, 30]\\). Since \\(0 \\notin [19, 30]\\), no collision occurs.\n- Car 2: Span at turn 19 is \\([-47, -36]\\). Since \\(0 \\notin [-47, -36]\\), no collision occurs.\n\nThe player can move up to \\(y = 9\\) by taking action \\(U\\) at turn 19. After this action:\n- At turn 20, the player position is \\(y_{20} = y_{19} + \\Delta y_{19} = 8 + 1 = 9\\), reaching (0, 9).\n- Since \\(y = 9\\) is not a freeway (no cars), there is no collision risk at turn 20.\n\nThis achieves the goal in \\(H = 1\\) turn, with the sequence consisting of one action: \\(a_{19} = U\\).\n\nNo shorter sequence is possible, as the player must increase \\(y\\) from 8 to 9, requiring at least one action. Moving down or staying would increase \\(H\\) and is unnecessary.\n\nThus, the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 1, and the action sequence is:\n\n\\boxed{ Turn 19: U }",
