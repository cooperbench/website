Move Left (L)\n- New head position: (3-1, 3) = (2,3).\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: (2,3) is not a wall (internal or border).\n  - Body: Snake has only one segment, so no body collision.\n- Food at (2,3): \n  - Value: +10 (positive food).\n  - Life span: 1 (will disappear after this turn if not eaten).\n  - Eating it: \n    - Since the snake is only the head, eating it will increase length to 2.\n    - New tail will be at (3,3), head at (2,3).\n    - No immediate collision since the tail moves away as the head moves onto the food.\n    - However, need to check \"Tail Reward Danger\":\n      - After eating, the head is at (2,3), tail at (3,3).\n      - Adjacent cells to head (2,3): (1,3), (3,3), (2,2), (2,4).\n      - Tail is at (3,3), which is adjacent.\n      - Is there positive food at the tail? No, the tail is at (3,3), and no food is listed there.\n      - So no danger here.\n- Conclusion: Safe move with +10 reward.\n\n#### 2. Move Up (U)\n- New head position: (3,3+1) = (3,4).\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: (3,4) is an internal obstacle → collision → death.\n- Conclusion: Not safe.\n\n#### 3. Move Down (D)\n- New head position: (3,3-1) = (3,2).\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: (3,2) is not a wall.\n  - Body: No body segments other than head.\n- Food: No food at (3,2).\n- Conclusion: Safe but no immediate reward.\n\n### Comparing Options\n\n- **Left (L)**: +10 reward, safe.\n- **Up (U)**: Death.\n- **Down (D)**: Safe but no reward.\n\n### Additional Considerations\n\n- **Food Life Span**: All foods have life_span=1, meaning they will disappear after this turn if not eaten.\n  - (1,2), (2,3), (2,5) will disappear next turn.\n- **Prioritization**: Since (2,3) is directly accessible via Left and gives +10, it's the best immediate option.\n- **Future Moves**: After moving Left to (2,3), the snake's length will be 2. Next moves would need to consider the tail position.\n\n### Verifying Tail Reward Danger for Left Move\n\nAfter moving Left:\n- Head: (2,3), Tail: (3,3).\nAdjacent to head:\n- (1,3): Wall (internal obstacle) → cannot move there next turn.\n- (3,3): Tail.\n- (2,2): Safe, no food.\n- (2,4): Internal obstacle → wall.\n\nNext possible moves from (2,3):\n- Current direction would be Left (since we moved Left).\n- Possible next moves: U, D, L (cannot move R).\n  - U: (2,4) → wall → death.\n  - D: (2,2) → safe.\n  - L: (1,3) → wall → death.\n  \nSo, the only safe move after Left would be Down to (2,2). But since we're only deciding the immediate move, this is acceptable.\n\n### Alternative: Move Down (D)\n\nIf we choose Down to (3,2):\n- No immediate reward.\n- Next turn, all food disappears.\n- Then the snake is at (3,2) with no food on the grid (assuming no new food spawns, but the problem doesn't specify spawning rules).\n- This seems less optimal than getting the +10 now.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe best immediate action is to move Left to (2,3) to eat the +10 food, as it's safe and provides the highest reward among available options.\n\n\\boxed{L}",

However, there are constraints:\n\n1. **No Instant Reverse**: Since the current direction is Left (L), the snake cannot immediately move Right (R) in the next turn.\n   - So, possible moves are U, D, L.\n\n2. **Avoid Walls and Body Collisions**:\n   - Let's check each possible move:\n     - **Up (U)**: (x, y+1) → (2, 4)\n       - Check for walls: (2,4) is an internal obstacle (from the list). So, cannot move Up.\n     - **Down (D)**: (x, y-1) → (2, 2)\n       - Check for walls: (2,2) is not a wall (not in border or internal obstacles).\n       - Check for body collision: The body is at (3,3), so no collision.\n     - **Left (L)**: (x-1, y) → (1, 3)\n       - Check for walls: (1,3) is an internal obstacle. Cannot move Left.\n   \n   - So, the only possible move is Down (D).\n\n### Checking for Food\n\nNow, let's see if moving Down leads to eating any food:\n\n- Moving Down to (2,2):\n  - Is there food at (2,2)? No, the food positions are (1,2), (2,5), (2,6).\n  \nSo, moving Down doesn't eat any food, but it's the only safe move available.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger Check\n\nEven though we're not eating any food in this move, let's understand this rule for future reference:\n\n- **Tail Reward Danger**: If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake.\n  - Currently, the tail is at (3,3).\n  - Adjacent cells to tail: (2,3), (3,2), (4,3), (3,4).\n    - Head is at (2,3), which is adjacent to tail.\n    - But the tail is at (3,3), which doesn't have food (food is at other positions).\n  - So, no danger here.\n\n### Verifying Other Possibilities\n\nIs there any other move that might be possible that I missed?\n\n- **Right (R)**: Not allowed because it's the reverse of Left.\n- **Up (U) and Left (L)**: Both lead to walls.\n  \nSo, Down is indeed the only viable move.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter evaluating all possible moves:\n\n- **Only possible and safe move**: Down (D).\n\n\\boxed{D}",

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State\n\nFirst, let's break down the given information to understand the current state of the game.\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions and Walls**:\n   - The grid is 8x8 (since x and y range from 0 to 7).\n   - Border walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So, the snake cannot move to any cell where x or y is 0 or 7.\n   - Internal obstacles (walls) are at: (1,6), (1,4), (3,4), (1,3), (2,4), (6,3), (5,5), (5,6). These are additional cells the snake cannot move into.\n\n2. **Snake Information**:\n   - Positions: Head at (2,2), body segment at (2,3). So, the snake is two segments long.\n   - Current direction: Down (D). This means the snake was moving downward in the previous move (from (2,1) to (2,2), but since the body is at (2,3), it seems there might be a confusion here. Wait, if the head is at (2,2) and body at (2,3), and direction is D (down), this implies the head moved from (2,3) to (2,2), which is actually moving up (since y decreases). This seems contradictory because moving down would increase y. Maybe the direction is the direction the head is facing now, meaning the next move would be in that direction. Let me clarify:\n     - If direction is D, then the next move would be to (x, y-1), i.e., decreasing y.\n     - Given head at (2,2), next move would be to (2,1).\n     - But the body is at (2,3), meaning the previous head was at (2,3), moved to (2,2), so direction is actually U (up). There might be a mistake in the given direction. Assuming the direction is correct as D, then the next move is (2,1).\n\n   For now, I'll proceed with the given direction D, meaning next move is (2,1).\n\n3. **Food Information**:\n   - Three food items:\n     - (1,2): value=8, life_span=1\n     - (2,5): value=8, life_span=1\n     - (2,6): value=9, life_span=1\n   - All foods have positive value (+1 score and +1 length when eaten).\n   - Life span is 1 for all, meaning they will disappear after this turn if not eaten (since countdown decreases this turn).\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nGiven the current direction is D (down), the possible moves are:\n- Continue Down (D): (2,1)\n- Turn Left (L): (1,2)\n- Turn Right (R): (3,2)\n\nCannot move Up (U) because that would be the opposite of current direction D (instant reverse is not allowed).\n\nNow, let's evaluate each possible move:\n\n1. **Move Down (D) to (2,1)**:\n   - Check if (2,1) is valid:\n     - Not a wall: borders are at y=0, so y=1 is valid.\n     - Internal walls: (2,1) is not in the internal walls list.\n     - Not body: body is at (2,3), so no collision.\n   - Food at (2,1)? No food listed there.\n   - Outcome: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n2. **Move Left (L) to (1,2)**:\n   - Check (1,2):\n     - Not a border wall (x=1 is between 0 and 7, y=2 is between 0 and 7).\n     - Internal walls: (1,6), (1,4), (1,3) are walls, but (1,2) is not.\n     - Not body: body is at (2,3).\n   - Food at (1,2): Yes, value=8, life_span=1.\n     - Eating this food: +1 score, length increases to 3.\n     - Tail is at (2,3), which will move to (2,2) (previous head position).\n     - New head at (1,2), new body segments at (2,2), (2,3).\n     - Check for Tail Reward Danger: Is the head adjacent to the tail after eating?\n       - After move: head at (1,2), tail at (2,3).\n       - Adjacent means sharing an edge (not diagonal), so (1,2) and (2,3) are diagonally adjacent (x differs by 1, y differs by 1), which is not considered adjacent in snake movement rules (usually adjacent means up/down/left/right). So no danger.\n   - Outcome: Eat positive food, safe.\n\n3. **Move Right (R) to (3,2)**:\n   - Check (3,2):\n     - Not border walls.\n     - Internal walls: (3,4) is a wall, but (3,2) is not.\n     - Not body.\n   - Food at (3,2)? No food listed there.\n   - Outcome: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n### Evaluating Best Move\n\nWe have three options:\n1. D: Safe, no food.\n2. L: Safe, eat positive food.\n3. R: Safe, no food.\n\nThe goal is to maximize score by eating positive food while avoiding risks. Here, moving Left allows eating a positive food safely, which is better than moving Down or Right where no food is eaten.\n\nNow, check if the food at (1,2) will disappear after this turn:\n- Life span is 1, and countdown decreases this turn, so if not eaten now, it disappears. So we should eat it now if possible.\n\nAlso, check other foods:\n- (2,5) and (2,6) are not reachable in this move (distance is more than 1), so they are irrelevant for this decision.\n\n### Verifying Tail Reward Danger\n\nJust to be thorough, let's confirm that eating (1,2) does not cause Tail Reward Danger:\n- Current head at (2,2), body at (2,3).\n- Move head to (1,2), body moves to (2,2).\n- New positions: head (1,2), body (2,2), (2,3).\n- Tail is at (2,3).\n- Is head adjacent to tail? (1,2) and (2,3): diagonally adjacent, not edge-adjacent, so no danger.\n\n### Checking Other Constraints\n\n- No instant reverse: Current direction is D, so cannot move U (which is opposite), but we're not considering U.\n- Wall collisions: Already checked for each move.\n- Body collision: Only possible if head moves into body, but body is at (2,3), and possible moves are to (2,1), (1,2), (3,2), none of which are (2,3).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe best immediate action is to move Left (L) to eat the positive food at (1,2), which is safe and maximizes the score.\n\n\\boxed{L}",

But U and L are invalid due to walls, leaving only Down (D).\n\nWait, but the current direction is Left, so the last move was from (2,2) to (1,2). The possible next moves are U, D, L (cannot go R, which would be back to (2,2)).\n\nBut U is to (1,3), which is a wall. L is to (0,2), which is a wall. So only D is valid.\n\nBut let's check if moving Down to (1,1) causes any collisions:\n\n- Snake body segments: (2,2) and (2,3). \n- Moving to (1,1): Does (1,1) coincide with any body segment? No.\n  \nAlso, no food at (1,1), so no growth.\n\n### Checking for Food Opportunities\n\nCurrent food positions:\n\n1. (2,5): To reach this, possible paths would need to be considered, but from (1,2), immediate moves are limited.\n   - From (1,2), cannot reach (2,5) in one move.\n2. (2,6): Similarly, cannot reach in one move.\n\nGiven that, the immediate goal is to avoid death and position for future food.\n\n### Potential Moves\n\nFrom (1,2), with current direction Left, possible moves:\n\n1. **Up (U)**: (1,3) → Wall. Invalid.\n2. **Down (D)**: (1,1) → Valid.\n   - Not a wall.\n   - Not a body segment.\n   - No food there, so no growth.\n3. **Left (L)**: (0,2) → Wall. Invalid.\n   \nOnly valid move is Down (D).\n\n### Verifying Tail Reward Danger\n\nIs the tail adjacent to the head with positive food?\n\n- Tail is at (2,3).\n- Adjacent cells to head (1,2): \n  - (0,2), (2,2), (1,1), (1,3)\n  - Tail is at (2,3), which is not adjacent to (1,2) (adjacent would be same x or y differing by 1; (2,3) is x+1, y+1, which is diagonal, not adjacent in this context).\n  \nSo no tail reward danger.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe only safe and valid move is Down (D).\n\n\\boxed{D}",

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Problem\n\nFirst, I need to understand the current state of the Snake game based on the provided information:\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The game is played on an 8x8 grid (since x and y range from 0 to 7).\n2. **Walls**:\n   - **Border Walls**: Located at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So, the snake cannot move outside these boundaries.\n   - **Internal Obstacles**: Specific cells like (1,6), (1,4), etc., are blocked.\n3. **Snake**:\n   - **Positions**: Head at (1,1), followed by body segments at (1,2) and tail at (2,2).\n   - **Current Direction**: The snake is moving Down (D).\n4. **Food**:\n   - Three pieces of food are present:\n     - (2,5): value=1, life_span=6\n     - (2,6): value=1, life_span=7\n     - (4,3): value=1, life_span=10\n\n### Movement Constraints\n\n- **No Instant Reverse**: Since the snake is moving Down (D), the next move cannot be Up (U).\n- **Possible Moves**: Left (L), Right (R), or continue Down (D).\n\n### Evaluating Possible Moves\n\n#### Option 1: Continue Down (D)\n- **New Head Position**: (1,0) because current head is at (1,1) and D decreases y by 1.\n- **Check for Walls**: y=0 is a border wall → **Invalid** (collision with wall).\n\n#### Option 2: Left (L)\n- **New Head Position**: (0,1) because current head is at (1,1) and L decreases x by 1.\n- **Check for Walls**: x=0 is a border wall → **Invalid** (collision with wall).\n\n#### Option 3: Right (R)\n- **New Head Position**: (2,1) because current head is at (1,1) and R increases x by 1.\n- **Check for Body Collision**: The body segments are at (1,2) and (2,2). The new head position (2,1) does not coincide with any body segment → **Valid**.\n- **Check for Obstacles**: No internal obstacles at (2,1) → **Valid**.\n- **Check for Food**: No food at (2,1) → No immediate reward, but safe.\n\n### Considering Food and Future Moves\n\nSince the immediate move Right (R) is safe, but doesn't lead to any food, I might want to consider if any food is reachable in subsequent moves.\n\n- **Food at (2,5)** and **(2,6)**:\n  - To reach (2,5), the snake would need to move up from (2,1) to (2,2), but (2,2) is the current tail.\n  - However, moving to (2,2) is the tail, which is safe because the tail will move away as the snake progresses.\n  - But, the current direction is D, and the next move after R would need to be U to reach (2,2). But U is the reverse of D, which is not allowed immediately but might be allowed in the next turn if the current move changes the direction.\n\n### Potential Path to Food\n\n1. **First Move (R)**: Move to (2,1).\n   - New direction becomes R.\n2. **Second Move (U)**: From (2,1), move to (2,2).\n   - Now, the tail is at (2,2), but it's the last segment. The tail will move to (1,2) if the head moves to (2,2).\n   - **Tail Reward Danger**: If there's food at (2,2), but in this case, there isn't any.\n3. **Third Move (U)**: From (2,2), move to (2,3).\n   - Continue upwards towards (2,5) or (2,6).\n\nHowever, the problem specifies that I must decide the immediate action for the current turn \\( t_0 \\). The only valid immediate move is Right (R), as the other options lead to walls or are invalid due to the no-reverse rule.\n\n### Verifying Tail Reward Danger\n\nThe problem mentions a special case: **Tail Reward Danger**. If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake. \n\n- Current tail is at (2,2).\n- Adjacent cells to the tail: (1,2), (3,2), (2,1), (2,3).\n- Current head is at (1,1). Adjacent to head: (0,1), (2,1), (1,0), (1,2).\n- The tail is at (2,2), which is adjacent to the head via (1,2). But (1,2) is a body segment, not the tail.\n- **Conclusion**: No immediate danger of Tail Reward Danger in the current state.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nGiven the constraints and the current state:\n- **Down (D)**: Leads to a wall → Invalid.\n- **Left (L)**: Leads to a wall → Invalid.\n- **Right (R)**: Safe and valid.\n\nSince Right is the only viable option, I must choose it.\n\n\\boxed{R}",

        "thinking": "Alright, let's tackle this Snake game scenario step by step. I'm going to analyze the current state of the game and decide the best immediate action to take at Turn 5. Here's how I'll approach it:\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n1. **Grid Layout**:\n   - The grid is 8x8 (since borders are at x=0/x=7 and y=0/y=7).\n   - Internal obstacles are at: (1,6), (1,4), (3,4), (1,3), (2,4), (6,3), (5,5), (5,6).\n\n2. **Snake**:\n   - Positions: Head at (2,1), then (1,1), then (1,2). So the snake is 3 segments long.\n   - Current direction: Right (R).\n\n3. **Food**:\n   - (2,5): value=1, life_span=5\n   - (2,6): value=1, life_span=6\n   - (4,3): value=1, life_span=9\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (2,1) moving right (R), the possible next moves are:\n- Up (U): (2,2)\n- Down (D): (2,0)\n- Left (L): (1,1) — but this is the body segment right after the head, so moving left would cause a collision.\n- Right (R): (3,1)\n\nBut since the current direction is R, we cannot instantly reverse to L (opposite of R). So, possible moves are U, D, R.\n\n### Evaluating Each Possible Move\n\n1. **Move Right (R) to (3,1)**:\n   - Check if (3,1) is valid:\n     - Not a wall: x=3 is not 0 or 7, y=1 is not 0 or 7.\n     - Not an internal obstacle: (3,1) is not in the list.\n     - Not a body segment: Snake body is at (1,1), (1,2). (3,1) is clear.\n   - No food at (3,1).\n   - Outcome: Move to (3,1), no score change, snake length same.\n\n2. **Move Up (U) to (2,2)**:\n   - Check (2,2):\n     - Not a wall.\n     - Not an obstacle.\n     - Not a body segment.\n   - No food at (2,2).\n   - Outcome: Move to (2,2), no score change, snake length same.\n\n3. **Move Down (D) to (2,0)**:\n   - Check (2,0):\n     - y=0 is a border wall.\n     - So, this is a wall collision → death.\n   - Not a valid move.\n\n### Considering Food\n\nCurrently, the foods are at:\n- (2,5): life_span=5, so disappears after turn 5+5=10.\n- (2,6): disappears after turn 5+6=11.\n- (4,3): disappears after turn 5+9=14.\n\nNone of these are immediately adjacent to the head (which is at (2,1)). The closest is (4,3), which is two moves right and two moves up from (2,1).\n\n### Tail Reward Danger\n\nThe tail is at (1,2). Is there positive food adjacent to the head that's also at the tail?\n- Head is at (2,1), tail at (1,2).\n- Adjacent cells to head: (1,1), (3,1), (2,0), (2,2).\n- Tail is at (1,2), which is diagonally adjacent, not directly adjacent (unless diagonal counts, but typically adjacency is up/down/left/right).\n- So no immediate tail reward danger.\n\n### Best Immediate Action\n\nFrom the possible moves:\n- Right (R) to (3,1): safe, no immediate benefit.\n- Up (U) to (2,2): safe, no immediate benefit.\n- Down (D): invalid (wall).\n\nBetween R and U, both are safe with no immediate benefit. But moving right seems to be continuing the current direction, which might be preferable unless there's a reason to turn.\n\nLooking ahead, moving right to (3,1) could be a step towards the food at (4,3), whereas moving up to (2,2) doesn't seem to lead towards any food directly.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Food Under Snake\n\nIs there food under the snake's body that could be eaten if we move away?\n- Snake body segments: (1,1), (1,2).\n- Foods are at (2,5), (2,6), (4,3) — none under the body.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe safest and most straightforward move is to continue moving right to (3,1), as it doesn't lead to any immediate danger and keeps options open for future moves towards food.\n\n\\boxed{R}",

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State\n\nFirst, let's break down the current state of the game to understand all the components:\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The game is played on an 8x8 grid (since x and y range from 0 to 7).\n   \n2. **Walls**:\n   - **Border Walls**: All cells where x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7 are walls. This means the snake cannot move outside the grid; it's bounded by these borders.\n   - **Internal Obstacles**: There are specific cells that are also walls:\n     - (1,6), (1,4), (3,4), (1,3), (2,4), (6,3), (5,5), (5,6)\n\n3. **Snake**:\n   - **Positions**: The snake's body is composed of three segments:\n     - Head at (3,1)\n     - Next segment at (2,1)\n     - Tail at (1,1)\n   - **Direction**: The head is currently moving to the Right (R).\n\n4. **Food**:\n   - There are three pieces of food on the grid:\n     - (2,5): value = 1, life_span = 4\n     - (2,6): value = 1, life_span = 5\n     - (4,3): value = 1, life_span = 8\n\n### Visualizing the Grid\n\nTo better understand the positions, let's visualize the grid with the snake and food positions:\n\n- **Snake**:\n  - Head (H) at (3,1)\n  - Body (B) at (2,1)\n  - Tail (T) at (1,1)\n  \n- **Food**:\n  - F1 at (2,5)\n  - F2 at (2,6)\n  - F3 at (4,3)\n\n- **Walls**:\n  - Borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7\n  - Internal: (1,6), (1,4), (3,4), (1,3), (2,4), (6,3), (5,5), (5,6)\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However, since the current direction is Right (R), the snake cannot instantly reverse to Left (L) in the next move (no instant reverse rule). So, possible immediate moves are U, D, R.\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n1. **Right (R)**: Move to (4,1)\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: (4,1) is not a wall (x=4 is not a border, and (4,1) is not in the internal obstacles list).\n     - Body: The snake's body is at (2,1) and (1,1), so (4,1) is safe.\n   - Check for food: No food at (4,1).\n   - After moving:\n     - Head moves to (4,1), body follows to (3,1), tail moves to (2,1), and the tail at (1,1) is removed.\n\n2. **Up (U)**: Move to (3,2)\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: (3,2) is not a wall.\n     - Body: The body is at (2,1) and (1,1), so (3,2) is safe.\n   - Check for food: No food at (3,2).\n   - After moving:\n     - Head at (3,2), body at (3,1), tail at (2,1).\n\n3. **Down (D)**: Move to (3,0)\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: y=0 is a border wall, so (3,0) is a wall → collision! This move is invalid.\n\nSo, valid immediate moves are R and U.\n\n### Evaluating Food\n\nNow, let's see if moving towards food is beneficial:\n\n1. **Food at (2,5)**:\n   - Current distance from head (3,1):\n     - Manhattan distance: |3-2| + |1-5| = 1 + 4 = 5\n   - To reach it, the snake would need to move upwards and leftwards, but currently moving right.\n   - Not immediately accessible; would require multiple turns.\n\n2. **Food at (2,6)**:\n   - Distance: |3-2| + |1-6| = 1 + 5 = 6\n   - Similarly, not immediately accessible.\n\n3. **Food at (4,3)**:\n   - Distance: |3-4| + |1-3| = 1 + 2 = 3\n   - To reach (4,3) from (3,1):\n     - One right to (4,1), then two up to (4,3).\n   - This seems reachable in a few moves.\n\n### Potential Path to Food at (4,3)\n\nLet's plan a path to (4,3):\n\n1. **Turn 6 (Current)**: Move R to (4,1)\n   - Snake: [(4,1), (3,1), (2,1)]\n2. **Turn 7**: Move U to (4,2)\n   - Snake: [(4,2), (4,1), (3,1)]\n   - Check for food: No food at (4,2).\n3. **Turn 8**: Move U to (4,3)\n   - Snake: [(4,3), (4,2), (4,1)]\n   - Eat food at (4,3): +1 score, length increases to 4.\n   - New tail is at (3,1), but since we ate food, tail stays at (4,1), and new segment is added where the tail was (so new tail is at (3,1)).\n\nThis seems like a viable plan to reach the food at (4,3) in two moves from now.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Food Under Snake\n\nThe rules mention that food can be under the snake's body but can only be eaten if:\n1. The body moves away, and\n2. The head moves onto the food cell.\n\nCurrently, the snake's body is at:\n- (2,1)\n- (1,1)\n\nLooking at the food positions:\n- (2,5), (2,6), (4,3) — none are under the snake's body.\n\nSo, no immediate food under the body to consider.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger\n\nThe rule states that if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nCurrently:\n- Tail is at (1,1)\n- Adjacent cells to tail:\n  - (0,1) — wall (x=0)\n  - (2,1) — body\n  - (1,0) — wall (y=0)\n  - (1,2) — possible\n- Head is at (3,1), which is not adjacent to tail (distance is 2).\n- No food at tail (1,1), so no danger here.\n\n### Comparing Moves R and U\n\nFrom the current position (3,1), moving:\n\n- **Right (R) to (4,1)**:\n  - Moves towards food at (4,3).\n  - Next move can be U to (4,2), then U to (4,3) to eat food.\n  \n- **Up (U) to (3,2)**:\n  - Moves away from the food at (4,3).\n  - Next moves would need to be R to (4,2), then U to (4,3), which is the same number of moves but starts with a detour.\n\nMoving R seems more direct towards the food.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Benefits\n\nIs there any immediate benefit to moving U?\n\n- Moving U to (3,2):\n  - No food there.\n  - Doesn't block any future paths.\n  - Doesn't provide any immediate advantage over moving R.\n\nMoving R:\n- Gets us closer to the food at (4,3).\n- No immediate risks.\n\n### Potential Risks with Moving R\n\nAre there any risks with moving R to (4,1)?\n\n- Next position after R: head at (4,1), body at (3,1), tail at (2,1).\n- Possible moves from (4,1):\n  - U to (4,2)\n  - D to (4,0) — wall (y=0), invalid.\n  - R to (5,1) — need to check:\n    - (5,1): not a wall, not body (body is at (3,1) and (2,1)).\n    - But moving R again may not be optimal unless there's food that way (no food at (5,1)).\n\nNo immediate risks seen with moving R.\n\n### Alternative Considerations\n\nIs there any food that might appear or disappear soon based on life_span?\n\nCurrent turn is 6.\n\nFood life_spans:\n- (2,5): life_span = 4 → disappears at turn 6 + 4 = turn 10.\n- (2,6): life_span = 5 → disappears at turn 11.\n- (4,3): life_span = 8 → disappears at turn 14.\n\nAll foods will persist for several more turns, so no urgency based on life_span.\n\n### Decision\n\nGiven the above analysis, the best immediate move is to move Right (R) towards the food at (4,3), as it sets up a clear path to eat the food in two moves without any immediate risks.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{R}",

        "thinking": "Alright, let's tackle this Snake game scenario step by step. I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action to take at turn \\( t_0 = 7 \\).\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**1. Snake Information:**\n- **Positions**: The snake's body is at [(4, 1), (3, 1), (2, 1)]. \n  - Head is at (4, 1).\n  - Next segment is at (3, 1), then (2, 1).\n- **Current Direction**: The head is moving Right (R). This means the last move was to the right (from (3,1) to (4,1)).\n\n**2. Walls and Obstacles:**\n- **Border Walls**: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid is from (0,0) to (7,7), and anything on these borders is a wall.\n- **Internal Obstacles**: \n  - (1,6), (1,4), (3,4), (1,3), (2,4), (6,3), (5,5), (5,6)\n\n**3. Food Items**: \nEach food is given as (x, y, life_span, value).\n- (2, 5, 3, 1): Positive food at (2,5), life span 3, value +1.\n- (2, 6, 4, 1): Positive food at (2,6), life span 4, value +1.\n- (4, 3, 7, 1): Positive food at (4,3), life span 7, value +1.\n- (3, 5, 10, 1): Positive food at (3,5), life span 10, value +1.\n\nAll foods are positive (+1), none are negative.\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (4,1) moving Right (R), the possible next moves are:\n- **Up (U)**: (4, 1) → (4, 2)\n- **Down (D)**: (4, 1) → (4, 0) → but y=0 is a wall, so invalid.\n- **Left (L)**: (4, 1) → (3, 1) → but this is the current body segment (reverse move), which is invalid (no instant reverse).\n- **Right (R)**: (4, 1) → (5, 1)\n\nSo, valid moves are U and R.\n\n### Evaluating Moves\n\n**Option 1: Move Up (U) to (4,2)**\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Body: Next segments are at (3,1) and (2,1). (4,2) is not in these, so no body collision.\n  - Walls: (4,2) is not a wall (not in border or internal obstacles).\n- Food at (4,2): No food listed there.\n- Next positions:\n  - Head moves to (4,2).\n  - Body segments follow: new body is [(4,2), (4,1), (3,1)].\n- Potential future moves from (4,2):\n  - Can reach (4,3) where there's food (4,3,7,1) next turn.\n\n**Option 2: Move Right (R) to (5,1)**\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Body: (5,1) is not in [(3,1), (2,1)], no collision.\n  - Walls: (5,1) is not a wall.\n- Food at (5,1): No food listed.\n- Next positions:\n  - Head at (5,1), body [(5,1), (4,1), (3,1)].\n- Potential future moves from (5,1):\n  - Can move U to (5,2), D to (5,0) (wall), L to (4,1) (body), R to (6,1).\n  - So possible moves: U or R.\n\n### Comparing Options\n\n**Move Up (U):**\n- No immediate food.\n- Next turn can go to (4,3) with food.\n- Current path seems safe.\n\n**Move Right (R):**\n- No immediate food.\n- Next moves are U or R, but no immediate food in sight.\n- Moving right may lead us towards the right wall (x=7), limiting options later.\n\n**Food Considerations:**\n- Closest food is at (4,3), which is reachable by moving U now and then U again next turn.\n- Other foods are at (2,5), (2,6), (3,5) which are further away and may require more turns to reach.\n\n**Safety:**\n- Both U and R are safe immediate moves.\n- Moving U seems to lead towards food more directly.\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nFrom the rules:\n- If head is adjacent to the tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake.\nCurrent tail is at (2,1).\nAdjacent to head (4,1): adjacent cells are (3,1), (5,1), (4,0), (4,2).\nTail is at (2,1), which is not adjacent to head (distance is 2 in x), so no danger here.\n\n### Decision\n\nBetween U and R:\n- U leads towards food at (4,3) in the next move.\n- R doesn't lead directly to food and may corner us.\n\nTherefore, the best immediate action is to move Up.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{U}",

        "thinking": "Alright, let's tackle this Snake game scenario step by step. I'm going to analyze the current state of the game and decide the best immediate action to take at turn \\( t_0 = 8 \\).\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**1. Grid Dimensions and Walls:**\n- The grid is 8x8 (since borders are at x=0/x=7 and y=0/y=7).\n- **Border walls**: Cannot move to x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.\n- **Internal obstacles**: \n  - (1,6), (1,4), (3,4), (1,3), (2,4), (6,3), (5,5), (5,6)\n\n**2. Snake:**\n- **Positions**: [(4,2), (4,1), (3,1)] \n  - Head at (4,2), body at (4,1), tail at (3,1).\n- **Current direction**: U (Up, which is (x, y+1)).\n\n**3. Food Items:**\nEach food is represented as (x, y, life_span, value). All foods have value=1 (positive), so we want to eat them unless it's dangerous.\n- (2,5,2,1)\n- (2,6,3,1)\n- (4,3,6,1)\n- (3,5,9,1)\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (4,2) and direction U, the possible moves are:\n- **Up (U)**: (4,3)\n- **Down (D)**: (4,1) — but this is the body segment, and moving into the body is deadly unless it's the tail that will move away.\n- **Left (L)**: (3,2)\n- **Right (R)**: (5,2)\n\nBut we cannot reverse direction instantly. Current direction is U, so we cannot choose D (Down) next. So possible moves are U, L, R.\n\n### Evaluating Each Possible Move\n\n**1. Up (U) - (4,3):**\n- Check if (4,3) is valid:\n  - Not a wall: x=4 is not 0 or 7; y=3 is not 0 or 7.\n  - Not an internal obstacle: (4,3) is not in the internal obstacles list.\n  - Not a body segment: Snake body is at (4,1) and (3,1), so (4,3) is safe.\n- Food at (4,3): Yes, there's food (4,3,6,1).\n  - Eating it: \n    - New head at (4,3), body grows to include old head (4,2), then (4,1), (3,1).\n    - Check for tail reward danger: \n      - Tail is at (3,1). Adjacent to head (4,3)? \n      - Adjacent means same x and y differs by 1 or same y and x differs by 1.\n      - (4,3) and (3,1): x differs by 1, y differs by 2 → not adjacent.\n      - So no tail reward danger.\n  - Safe to eat.\n\n**2. Left (L) - (3,2):**\n- Check if (3,2) is valid:\n  - Not a wall.\n  - Not an internal obstacle.\n  - Not a body segment.\n- Food at (3,2): No food there.\n- Just moving to an empty cell is safe but doesn't give points.\n\n**3. Right (R) - (5,2):**\n- Check if (5,2) is valid:\n  - Not a wall.\n  - Not an internal obstacle.\n  - Not a body segment.\n- Food at (5,2): No food there.\n- Safe but no points.\n\n### Comparing Moves\n\n- **Up (U)**: Eats food at (4,3), gains +1, length increases.\n- **Left (L)**: Safe but no gain.\n- **Right (R)**: Safe but no gain.\n\nEating food is preferable unless it's dangerous. Here, eating (4,3) is safe and beneficial.\n\n### Checking Other Foods for Future Planning\n\nJust to be thorough, let's see where other foods are:\n- (2,5), (2,6), (3,5) are above the current head.\n- After moving U to (4,3), next moves could aim towards these, but for now, immediate gain is at (4,3).\n\n### Potential Risks\n\nIs there any immediate risk if we don't eat the food now?\n- Food at (4,3) has life_span=6, so it will disappear at turn 8 + 6 = turn 14. We have time.\nBut no immediate risk in eating it now.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe best immediate action is to move Up (U) to eat the food at (4,3), gaining +1 point safely.\n\n\\boxed{U}",

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State\n\nFirst, let's break down the current state of the game to understand where everything is positioned.\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The grid is 8x8 (from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7). The borders (x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7) are walls that the snake cannot pass through.\n   \n2. **Internal Obstacles**: There are additional walls at the following coordinates:\n   - (1, 6), (1, 4), (3, 4), (1, 3), (2, 4), (6, 3), (5, 5), (5, 6)\n   These are like barriers within the grid that the snake must avoid.\n\n3. **Snake Position**: The snake's body is represented as a list of coordinates starting from the head:\n   - Head: (4, 3)\n   - Next segment: (4, 2)\n   - Next segment: (4, 1)\n   - Tail: (3, 1)\n   The snake's current direction is \"U\" (Up), meaning it was moving upwards in the previous turn.\n\n4. **Food Items**: There are three pieces of food with their positions, values, and remaining life spans:\n   - (2, 5): value = 1, life_span = 1\n   - (2, 6): value = 2, life_span = 1\n   - (3, 5): value = 8, life_span = 1\n   All foods have a life_span of 1, meaning they will disappear after this turn if not eaten.\n\n### Visualizing the Grid\n\nTo better understand, let's visualize the grid with the snake and food positions. Here's a simplified representation (with 'S' for snake, 'F' for food, 'W' for walls, and '.' for empty spaces):\n\n```\ny=7: W W W W W W W W\ny=6: W . W . . . W W\ny=5: W . F . F . W W\ny=4: W W W W W . W W\ny=3: W W S . . . W W\ny=2: W . S . . . W W\ny=1: W . S S . . W W\ny=0: W W W W W W W W\nx=  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n```\n\n- Snake head is at (4,3), moving Up (from (4,2) to (4,3)).\n- Food at (2,5), (2,6), (3,5).\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However, it cannot reverse its direction instantly. Since the current direction is Up, the opposite direction is Down, so Down is not an option this turn.\n\n**Available moves**: U, L, R\n\nNow, let's evaluate each possible move:\n\n1. **Up (U)**: Move from (4,3) to (4,4)\n   - Check if (4,4) is valid:\n     - Not a wall: Walls are at borders and internal obstacles. (4,4) is not listed as a wall.\n     - Not part of the snake's body: Snake body is at (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1). (4,4) is not in this list.\n   - Is there food at (4,4)? No, the foods are at (2,5), (2,6), (3,5).\n   - Outcome: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n2. **Left (L)**: Move from (4,3) to (3,3)\n   - Check if (3,3) is valid:\n     - Not a wall: (3,3) is not listed as a wall.\n     - Not part of the snake's body: (3,1) is the tail, but (3,3) is not in the body list.\n   - Is there food at (3,3)? No.\n   - Outcome: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n3. **Right (R)**: Move from (4,3) to (5,3)\n   - Check if (5,3) is valid:\n     - Not a wall: (5,3) is not listed as a wall.\n     - Not part of the snake's body: (5,3) is not in the body list.\n   - Is there food at (5,3)? No.\n   - Outcome: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n### Evaluating Food\n\nAll foods have a life_span of 1, meaning they will disappear after this turn. Therefore, if we want to eat any food, we must do so this turn.\n\nLet's see if any food is adjacent to the head (one move away):\n\n- (2,5): Distance from (4,3) is |4-2| + |3-5| = 2 + 2 = 4 (not adjacent)\n- (2,6): Distance from (4,3) is |4-2| + |3-6| = 2 + 3 = 5 (not adjacent)\n- (3,5): Distance from (4,3) is |4-3| + |3-5| = 1 + 2 = 3 (not adjacent)\n\nNone of the foods are adjacent to the head, meaning we cannot reach any food in one move. Therefore, we cannot eat any food this turn, and all foods will disappear after this turn.\n\n### Avoiding Future Collisions\n\nEven though we can't eat food this turn, we should choose a move that doesn't lead us into a dead end or immediate danger next turn.\n\nLet's consider each possible move's implications for the next turn:\n\n1. **Up (U) to (4,4)**:\n   - Next position: (4,4)\n   - Possible next moves (cannot go Down):\n     - Up to (4,5): Check if valid:\n       - (4,5): Not a wall, not in current body (but body will move)\n       - Current body will move: tail at (3,1) moves to (4,1), so new body: [(4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1)]\n       - (4,5) is not in new body, safe.\n     - Left to (3,4): \n       - (3,4) is a wall (from internal obstacles list), so cannot go left.\n     - Right to (5,4):\n       - (5,4): Not a wall, not in new body, safe.\n   - So from (4,4), possible next moves: Up or Right.\n\n2. **Left (L) to (3,3)**:\n   - Next position: (3,3)\n   - Possible next moves (cannot go Right):\n     - Up to (3,4): (3,4) is a wall, cannot go.\n     - Down to (3,2):\n       - (3,2): Not a wall, not in new body [(3,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1)], safe.\n     - Left to (2,3):\n       - (2,3): Not a wall, not in new body, safe.\n   - So from (3,3), possible next moves: Down or Left.\n\n3. **Right (R) to (5,3)**:\n   - Next position: (5,3)\n   - Possible next moves (cannot go Left):\n     - Up to (5,4):\n       - (5,4): Not a wall, not in new body [(5,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1)], safe.\n     - Down to (5,2):\n       - (5,2): Not a wall, not in new body, safe.\n     - Right to (6,3):\n       - (6,3) is a wall (internal obstacle), cannot go.\n   - So from (5,3), possible next moves: Up or Down.\n\nAll immediate moves seem safe, but let's see which one gives us more options or better positioning for potential future food.\n\n### Choosing the Best Move\n\nSince we can't eat any food this turn, our primary goal is to stay alive and position ourselves for potential future food spawns.\n\n- Moving Up to (4,4):\n  - Next turn options: Up or Right.\n  - Moving towards the center might be safer as it gives more options in future turns.\n\n- Moving Left to (3,3):\n  - Next turn options: Down or Left.\n  - Moving left might corner us near the wall at (3,4) and (2,4).\n\n- Moving Right to (5,3):\n  - Next turn options: Up or Down.\n  - Moving right also seems safe, but we have walls at (5,5) and (5,6) above, so moving up might be limited soon.\n\n**Best Choice**: Moving Up to (4,4) seems the safest as it keeps us more central and offers two options next turn (Up or Right).\n\n### Verifying Tail Reward Danger\n\nOne special rule is the \"Tail Reward Danger\": if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nIn our case:\n- Current tail is at (3,1).\n- Adjacent cells to head (4,3) are:\n  - Up: (4,4)\n  - Down: (4,2) - part of body\n  - Left: (3,3)\n  - Right: (5,3)\n- Tail is at (3,1), which is not adjacent to head (distance is |4-3| + |3-1| = 1 + 2 = 3).\n- So no tail reward danger here.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter evaluating all options, moving **Up (U)** is the safest choice that maintains flexibility for future moves without risking immediate danger.\n\n\\boxed{U}",

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State\n\nFirst, let's break down the current state to understand the scenario:\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The grid is 8x8 (from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7).\n2. **Walls**:\n   - **Border Walls**: All cells where x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7 are walls.\n   - **Internal Obstacles**: Specific cells that are walls: (1,6), (1,4), (3,4), (1,3), (2,4), (6,3), (5,5), (5,6).\n3. **Snake**:\n   - **Positions**: Head at (4,4), followed by body segments at (4,3), (4,2), and tail at (4,1).\n   - **Direction**: The snake is currently moving **Up (U)**, meaning its head is at (4,4) and was at (4,3) in the previous move.\n4. **Food Items**:\n   - (2,6): value=2, life_span=1\n   - (3,5): value=7, life_span=1\n   - (3,1): value=10, life_span=1\n\n### Possible Moves from Current Position\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However, due to movement constraints:\n\n1. **No Instant Reverse**: Since the snake is moving Up (U), it cannot move Down (D) in the next turn.\n   - **Allowed Moves**: U, L, R\n\nNow, let's evaluate each possible move:\n\n#### 1. Move Up (U) to (4,5)\n   - **Check for Walls**:\n     - (4,5) is not listed as a wall (border walls are at y=7, so y=5 is safe).\n     - Internal walls don't include (4,5).\n   - **Check for Body Collision**:\n     - Current body segments: (4,3), (4,2), (4,1). (4,5) is not part of the body.\n   - **Food Check**:\n     - No food at (4,5).\n   - **Conclusion**: Safe move, but no immediate reward.\n\n#### 2. Move Left (L) to (3,4)\n   - **Check for Walls**:\n     - (3,4) is listed as an internal obstacle (wall).\n   - **Conclusion**: Invalid move (would collide with wall).\n\n#### 3. Move Right (R) to (5,4)\n   - **Check for Walls**:\n     - (5,4) is not listed as a wall.\n     - Border walls are at x=7, so x=5 is safe.\n   - **Check for Body Collision**:\n     - Body segments: (4,3), (4,2), (4,1). (5,4) is not part of the body.\n   - **Food Check**:\n     - No food at (5,4).\n   - **Conclusion**: Safe move, but no immediate reward.\n\n### Evaluating Food Options\n\nGiven that moving Up or Right are safe but don't lead to food, let's see if we can plan to reach food in subsequent moves:\n\n1. **Food at (3,5)**:\n   - Current head at (4,4). To reach (3,5):\n     - Next move: Left to (3,4) → but (3,4) is a wall. Cannot go left.\n     - Alternative path: Up to (4,5), then Left to (3,5).\n       - But food at (3,5) has life_span=1. After this turn, it will disappear (since countdown decreases every turn including current).\n       - So, cannot reach it in time.\n\n2. **Food at (2,6)**:\n   - Current head at (4,4). To reach (2,6):\n     - Path: Left to (3,4) → wall, cannot.\n     - Up to (4,5), then Left to (3,5), then Left to (2,5), then Up to (2,6).\n       - Life_span=1, will disappear after this turn. Cannot reach in time.\n\n3. **Food at (3,1)**:\n   - Current head at (4,4). To reach (3,1):\n     - Path: Down to (4,3) → but cannot reverse direction (current direction is Up, cannot go Down).\n     - Left to (3,4) → wall.\n     - Right to (5,4), then Down to (5,3), then Left to (4,3), then Down to (4,2), then Left to (3,2), then Down to (3,1).\n       - Life_span=1, will disappear after this turn. Cannot reach in time.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger Check\n\nEven though there's no immediate food to eat, we should check if moving in a certain direction could lead to a future \"Tail Reward Danger\":\n\n- The tail is at (4,1). For tail reward danger, the head must be adjacent to the tail, and the tail cell has positive food.\n- Currently, head is at (4,4), tail at (4,1). They are not adjacent (distance is 3 in y-coordinate).\n- So, no immediate danger from this.\n\n### Decision Between Safe Moves\n\nFrom the above, the safe moves are:\n- Up (U) to (4,5)\n- Right (R) to (5,4)\n\nBoth are safe with no immediate reward. We need to choose one that might lead to better opportunities in future turns.\n\n**Option 1: Up to (4,5)**\n- Next possible moves from (4,5):\n  - Continue Up to (4,6) (but then limited by walls and obstacles).\n  - Left to (3,5) (but (3,5) is not a wall, but food there will be gone).\n  - Right to (5,5) (but (5,5) is a wall).\n\n**Option 2: Right to (5,4)**\n- Next possible moves from (5,4):\n  - Up to (5,5) → wall.\n  - Down to (5,3) → check if (5,3) is safe:\n    - Not a wall (internal walls include (6,3), not (5,3)).\n    - Not part of body (body will have moved to (4,4), (4,3), (4,2)).\n    - No food at (5,3).\n  - Left to (4,4) → would collide with body (new body after move: (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2)).\n\nSo, moving Right seems slightly better because from (5,4), we can move Down to (5,3), opening more options.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nBetween the two safe moves (Up and Right), moving Right seems to offer a slightly better path for future moves without immediate risks.\n\n\\boxed{R}",

        "thinking": "Alright, let's tackle this Snake game scenario step by step. I'm going to analyze the current state of the game and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding any risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**Current Turn**: 11  \n**Walls**:\n- Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (so the playable area is from x=1 to x=6 and y=1 to y=6).\n- Internal obstacles: (1,6), (1,4), (3,4), (1,3), (2,4), (6,3), (5,5), (5,6)\n\n**Snake Positions**: [(5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2)]  \n- Head is at (5,4), direction is Right (R).\n- Body segments: (4,4), (4,3), (4,2) (tail is at (4,2)).\n\n**Food Items**:\n1. (2,6): value=1, life_span=1\n2. (3,5): value=6, life_span=1\n3. (3,1): value=9, life_span=1\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (5,4) with direction R, the possible moves are:\n- **Right (R)**: (6,4)\n- **Up (U)**: (5,5)\n- **Down (D)**: (5,3)\n  \nCannot move Left (L) because that's the opposite of the current direction (R), which is not allowed.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each possible move:\n\n#### 1. Move Right (R) to (6,4)\n- Check for walls: x=7 is a wall, but (6,4) is within bounds.\n- Internal obstacles: (6,3) is an obstacle, but (6,4) is not listed as an obstacle.\n- Check for body collision: Snake body is at (4,4), (4,3), (4,2). (6,4) is not in the body.\n- Food at (6,4)? No food listed there.\n  \nThis move is safe but doesn't get any food.\n\n#### 2. Move Up (U) to (5,5)\n- Check for walls: y=7 is the upper wall, (5,5) is within bounds.\n- Internal obstacles: (5,5) is listed as an obstacle! So cannot move here.\n  \nThis move is invalid due to obstacle.\n\n#### 3. Move Down (D) to (5,3)\n- Check for walls: y=0 is the lower wall, (5,3) is within bounds.\n- Internal obstacles: (6,3) is an obstacle, but (5,3) is not listed as an obstacle.\n- Check for body collision: Snake body is at (4,4), (4,3), (4,2). (5,3) is not in the body.\n- Food at (5,3)? No food listed there.\n  \nThis move is safe but doesn't get any food.\n\n### Evaluating Food Options\n\nCurrently, none of the immediate moves lead to food. But let's see where the food is and if we can plan to reach it:\n\n1. (2,6): value=1, life_span=1\n   - Current turn is 11, so it will disappear at turn 12.\n   - Distance from head (5,4) to (2,6): \n     - x: 5 to 2 (3 left)\n     - y: 4 to 6 (2 up)\n     - Total moves needed: at least 3 (since can't move diagonally).\n   - But life_span is 1, so it will disappear next turn. Can't reach it in time.\n\n2. (3,5): value=6, life_span=1\n   - Disappears at turn 12.\n   - Distance from (5,4) to (3,5):\n     - x: 5 to 3 (2 left)\n     - y: 4 to 5 (1 up)\n     - Minimum moves: 2.\n   - Can't reach in one move.\n\n3. (3,1): value=9, life_span=1\n   - Disappears at turn 12.\n   - Distance from (5,4) to (3,1):\n     - x: 5 to 3 (2 left)\n     - y: 4 to 1 (3 down)\n     - Minimum moves: 3.\n   - Can't reach in one move.\n\nSo, none of the food can be eaten this turn. \n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nThe rule mentions that if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nCurrent tail is at (4,2). Is the head adjacent to the tail?\n- Head at (5,4), tail at (4,2).\n- Adjacent means one move away: (5,4) to (4,2) is x-1 and y-2, which is not adjacent (needs x or y to differ by 1, not both).\n  \nWait, adjacent means one coordinate differs by 1, other is same, or both differ by 1 (like diagonally). But in Snake, usually adjacent is up, down, left, right (not diagonally).\n\nSo adjacent to (5,4):\n- (5,5), (5,3), (6,4), (4,4)\nTail is at (4,2), which is not adjacent.\n\nSo no tail reward danger here.\n\n### Deciding the Move\n\nSince none of the food can be eaten this turn, and all possible moves are safe (R to (6,4) and D to (5,3)), we can choose either. \n\nBetween R and D:\n- Moving R: heads towards the right wall (x=7), but currently at x=5, so still space.\n- Moving D: heads towards y=0, currently at y=4, moving to y=3.\n\nNo immediate advantage to either, but moving R keeps the direction consistent (current direction is R), which might be simpler unless we have a reason to turn.\n\nAlternatively, moving D could be preparing to go towards the food at (3,1) next turn, but since that food disappears next turn, it's not reachable.\n\nGiven that, moving R seems fine to keep options open.\n\nBut wait, moving R to (6,4):\nNext turn, from (6,4), direction R:\nPossible moves:\n- R: (7,4) - x=7 is wall, so can't.\n- U: (6,5)\n- D: (6,3) - obstacle at (6,3), so can't.\nSo only U is possible next turn if we go R now.\n\nMoving D to (5,3):\nNext turn, from (5,3), direction D:\nPossible moves:\n- D: (5,2) - y=0 is wall, but y=2 is fine.\n- L: (4,3) - body is at (4,3) next turn? Let's see:\nCurrent body: [(5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2)]\nAfter move D to (5,3), new body: [(5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3)] - tail (4,2) is gone.\nSo (4,3) is now part of body, so can't move L to (4,3).\n- R: (6,3) - obstacle.\nSo only D is possible next turn if we go D now.\n\nHmm, both moves lead to being forced into a single direction next turn.\n\nGiven that, moving R now allows moving U next turn, which might open more options later.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter considering all possibilities, the safest move is to continue in the current direction since it doesn't lead to any immediate danger and keeps the snake moving without colliding.\n\n**Action**: R\n\n\\boxed{R}",

So, the snake cannot move to these coordinates.\n   - **Internal Obstacles**: \n     - (1,6), (1,4), (3,4), (1,3), (2,4), (6,3), (5,5), (5,6)\n     - These are like blocks the snake cannot pass through.\n\n3. **Snake**:\n   - **Positions**: [(6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3)]\n     - Head is at (6,4), next segment at (5,4), then (4,4), and tail at (4,3).\n   - **Current Direction**: R (Right). This means the snake was moving to the right in the previous move.\n\n4. **Food**:\n   - (3,5,6,1): At position (3,5), life span 6, value +1 (positive food).\n   - (3,1,8,1): At position (3,1), life span 8, value +1 (positive food).\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However, there are constraints:\n\n- **No Instant Reverse**: Since the current direction is R (Right), the snake cannot immediately go Left (L) in the next move. So, possible moves are U, D, R.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each possible move from the head's current position (6,4):\n\n1. **Right (R)**: (6,4) → (7,4)\n   - Check if (7,4) is valid:\n     - x=7 is a border wall → Invalid (collision with wall).\n   - **Cannot move Right**.\n\n2. **Up (U)**: (6,4) → (6,5)\n   - Check if (6,5) is valid:\n     - Not a border wall (x=6, y=5 are within bounds).\n     - Not in internal obstacles: Internal obstacles are at (1,6), (1,4), etc. — (6,5) is not listed.\n     - Not part of the snake's body: Snake body is at (5,4), (4,4), (4,3) — (6,5) is not here.\n   - **Valid move**.\n   - Is there food at (6,5)? No, food is at (3,5) and (3,1).\n   - So, moving Up is safe but doesn't eat food.\n\n3. **Down (D)**: (6,4) → (6,3)\n   - Check if (6,3) is valid:\n     - Not a border wall.\n     - Internal obstacles: (6,3) is listed as an internal obstacle → Invalid (collision with obstacle).\n   - **Cannot move Down**.\n\n4. **Left (L)**: (6,4) → (5,4)\n   - But current direction is R, so moving L is reverse → Not allowed.\n   - **Cannot move Left**.\n\n### Available Moves\n\nFrom the above, the only possible move is **Up (U)** to (6,5).\n\nBut let's double-check if there's any other consideration, especially regarding food.\n\n### Food Considerations\n\nThe two foods are at (3,5) and (3,1), both with value +1.\n\n- (3,5): Life span 6, value +1.\n- (3,1): Life span 8, value +1.\n\nCurrently, the snake is at positions [(6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3)].\n\nIs there any way to reach the food in one move? \n\n- From (6,4), the food at (3,5) is 3 units left and 1 unit up. Can't reach in one move.\n- Food at (3,1) is 3 units left and 3 units down. Also can't reach in one move.\n\nSo, no food can be eaten in the immediate next move. Therefore, the priority is to move safely without colliding.\n\n### Checking for Future Moves\n\nEven though we can't eat food now, moving Up to (6,5) might open paths to reach food in future moves. \n\nAfter moving to (6,5), possible next moves would be from there, considering the new direction would be U.\n\nAlternatively, is there any danger in moving Up?\n\n- **Tail Reward Danger**: Is the head adjacent to the tail, and is there positive food on the tail cell?\n  - Tail is at (4,3).\n  - Head is at (6,4). Adjacent cells to head are (6,5), (6,3), (5,4), (7,4).\n  - Tail is at (4,3), which is not adjacent to head (distance is more than 1).\n  - So, no tail reward danger here.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe only safe and allowed move is **Up (U)** to (6,5). Moving Right hits a wall, Down hits an obstacle, and Left is a reverse move which is not allowed.\n\n\\boxed{U}",

(6,6) is not in these.\n   - Food at (6,6)? No food listed there.\n   - Valid move, but no immediate reward.\n\n2. **Move Left (L)**: (6,5) → (5,5)\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: x=0 is a wall, but (5,5) is not a border wall.\n     - Internal obstacles: (5,5) is an internal obstacle! So this is a wall.\n   - Cannot move here; it's a wall.\n\n3. **Move Right (R)**: (6,5) → (7,5)\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: x=7 is a border wall.\n   - Cannot move here; it's a wall.\n\n### Re-evaluating Possible Moves\n\nFrom the above, moving U is the only valid immediate move. However, moving U to (6,6) doesn't lead to eating any food. \n\nBut let's check if there's any food that can be targeted in the next moves:\n\n- Food at (3,5): To reach this, we'd need to move left from (6,5), but left is blocked by (5,5) being a wall.\n- Food at (3,1): Far away, not immediately reachable.\n- Food at (5,3): To reach this, we'd need to move down from (6,5), but current direction is U, and moving D is an instant reverse, which is not allowed.\n\n### Checking for Food Under Snake's Body\n\nThe rules mention that food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if:\n1. The body moves away, and\n2. The head moves onto the food cell.\n\nLooking at the snake's body positions:\n- (6,4), (5,4), (4,4)\n- Food positions: (3,5), (3,1), (5,3)\nNone of the food is currently under the snake's body.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger\n\nCheck if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food:\n- Tail is at (4,4).\n- Adjacent cells to head (6,5): (6,6), (5,5), (7,5), (6,4). (4,4) is not adjacent to (6,5).\n- So no danger from tail reward.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe only valid move is Up (U), even though it doesn't lead to eating food immediately. The other moves are either into walls or are instant reverses.\n\n\\boxed{U}",

(6,7) is y=7 which is a wall, so no.\nCan we go Right? (7,6) is x=7, wall, no.\nCan we go Down? That would be reversing direction from Up to Down, which is not allowed immediately.\nSo only Left is possible.\n\nBut let's check if (5,6) is safe:\n- Snake body: (6,5), (6,4), (5,4) — (5,6) is not part of the body.\n- Walls: (5,6) is an internal obstacle? Checking the list: (5,6) is listed as an internal obstacle. So cannot move to (5,6).\n\nHmm, so Left to (5,6) is blocked by an obstacle.\n\nWait, is (5,6) an obstacle? Yes, it's in the internal obstacles list.\n\nSo, no valid moves from current position? That can't be right. Maybe I missed something.\n\nWait, the snake's current direction is Up, meaning it came from (6,5) to (6,6). Next moves cannot be Down (reverse), but can be Up, Left, or Right.\n\nUp: (6,7) — wall.\nRight: (7,6) — wall.\nLeft: (5,6) — obstacle.\n\nSo all possible moves are blocked? That would mean the snake is trapped and has no valid moves, which would imply game over.\n\nBut let me double-check the snake's body positions to ensure I didn't miss anything.\n\nSnake positions: [(6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4)]\nSo body segments are at (6,5), (6,4), (5,4).\n\nMoving Left to (5,6):\n- (5,6) is not part of the body, but it is an obstacle.\nSo cannot move there.\n\nIs there any other move? Wait, is Down allowed? Normally, you cannot reverse direction immediately, but if all other moves are blocked, is Down allowed?\n\nThe rules say: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\"\n\nCurrent direction is Up, so Down is opposite, so cannot move Down.\n\nSo seems like no valid moves. Maybe the snake is indeed trapped.\n\nBut let me check if there's any other interpretation.\n\nMaybe the snake can stay in place? But the rules say it must move 1 cell per turn.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the internal obstacles are only the listed ones, and (5,6) is not in the list? Wait, the internal obstacles are:\n\n(1,6), (1,4), (3,4), (1,3), (2,4), (6,3), (5,5), (5,6)\n\nYes, (5,6) is in the list. So cannot move there.\n\nSo seems like no possible moves. Maybe the initial assumption about direction is wrong.\n\nWait, the snake's head is at (6,6), previous at (6,5), so direction is Up (from (6,5) to (6,6)).\n\nIs there any other way to interpret the direction? Maybe the direction is the direction the head is pointing, not the direction it came from?\n\nBut the snake's movement is such that the head moves in the current direction, and the body follows.\n\nGiven that, if direction is Up, then next move can be Up, Left, or Right, but not Down.\n\nBut all three are blocked:\n- Up: wall\n- Left: obstacle\n- Right: wall\n\nSo seems like no valid moves. Maybe the snake is supposed to die here.\n\nBut that seems odd for a puzzle. Maybe I missed that the tail is moving, so some body parts might free up.\n\nCurrent snake: [(6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4)]\nIf we move Left to (5,6), which is obstacle, can't.\nIf we move Up to (6,7), wall.\nRight to (7,6), wall.\nDown is reverse, not allowed.\n\nSo no moves. Maybe the initial direction is given as the direction the head is facing, meaning the next move would be in that direction unless changed.\n\nBut even then, next move would be Up to (6,7), which is wall.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the direction is the direction the head is moving next, not the direction it came from.\n\nBut the description says \"Snake Head Direction\", which is likely the direction it's currently moving in.\n\nGiven that, and all possible moves are blocked, the only conclusion is that the snake has no valid moves and thus dies.\n\nBut since the task is to choose an action, and all possible actions lead to death, maybe the answer is to choose any, but since all are invalid, perhaps the answer is that no move is possible.\n\nBut the format requires an action, so maybe we have to choose one even if it leads to death.\n\nGiven that, the only possible action is Left (even though it's into an obstacle), since the others are walls or reverse.\n\nBut moving into an obstacle is deadly, same as wall.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the direction can be changed even if the move is invalid, but the snake would die.\n\nGiven that, the answer would be to choose one of the possible direction changes, even if it's invalid.\n\nSo, possible direction changes from Up are Left or Right (cannot go Down).\n\nLeft is into obstacle, Right is into wall.\n\nBetween these, both are deadly, but the format requires an answer, so:\n\n\\boxed{L} \n\n(Left, even though it's into an obstacle, as it's the only non-reverse direction that isn't a wall, but still deadly.)\n\nBut let me think again: maybe the snake can move Down, even though it's reverse, if no other moves are possible. But the rules say \"no instant reverse\", implying it's never allowed, not even as a last resort.\n\nSo seems like no valid moves, hence the snake is trapped and must die. The answer would be to choose one of the invalid moves, and Left seems as good as any.\n\nFinal answer: \\boxed{L} \n\n(Note: This seems like a trap scenario where the snake has no valid moves and must collide. If there's a misinterpretation, please clarify the rules, especially regarding direction and obstacle definitions.)\n\n### Re-evaluating Possible Moves\n\nWait a minute, let me re-examine the snake's body positions to ensure that moving Left to (5,6) is indeed into an obstacle.\n\nSnake body: [(6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4)]\nObstacles: (1,6), (1,4), (3,4), (1,3), (2,4), (6,3), (5,5), (5,6)\n\nSo (5,6) is an obstacle, so cannot move there.\n\nSimilarly, (6,7) is wall, (7,6) is wall.\n\nDown is reverse, not allowed.\n\nSo truly no valid moves. Hence, the snake is trapped.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter carefully analyzing all possible moves from the current position and direction, the snake has no valid moves that don't result in a collision with a wall, obstacle, or its own body (considering the no-reverse rule). Therefore, the snake is forced into a collision no matter what. \n\nGiven the requirement to provide an action, and considering that moving Left is the only non-reverse direction that isn't directly into a wall (though it's into an obstacle), the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{L}",
