        "thinking": "### Understanding the Problem\n\nFirst, I need to understand the current state of the Snake game based on the provided information:\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, indicating an 8x8 grid (since coordinates start at 0 and go up to 7).\n   \n2. **Internal Obstacles**: There are five internal walls at positions (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), and (2,6). These are cells the snake cannot move into.\n\n3. **Snake Position**: The snake is currently just a single segment at (3,3), meaning it's only the head with no body segments yet. The head is facing left (\"L\").\n\n4. **Food Items**: There are three pieces of food:\n   - (4,2): value=1, life_span=10\n   - (1,3): value=1, life_span=10\n   - (2,4): value=1, life_span=10\n   All foods are positive (+1 reward) and have the same life span.\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nSince the snake is facing left (\"L\"), its current direction is left. The possible moves are Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), and Right (R). However, there's a rule against instant reverse: you cannot move in the opposite direction of the current one in the next turn. \n\n- Current direction: Left (L)\n- Opposite direction: Right (R)\n  \nSo, the snake cannot move Right (R) next. Valid immediate moves are U, D, or L.\n\n### Evaluating Each Possible Move\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move to see which is the best:\n\n1. **Move Left (L)**:\n   - Current head: (3,3)\n   - New head position: (3-1,3) = (2,3)\n   - Check for walls or obstacles:\n     - x=2 is not a border wall.\n     - y=3 is not a border wall.\n     - (2,3) is not in the internal obstacles list.\n   - Check for food at (2,3): No, the foods are at (4,2), (1,3), (2,4).\n   - So, this move just moves the head to (2,3) with no food eaten.\n   - Since the snake has no body segments yet, no risk of collision.\n\n2. **Move Up (U)**:\n   - New head position: (3,3+1) = (3,4)\n   - Check walls/obstacles:\n     - y=4 is not a border.\n     - (3,4) is not an obstacle.\n   - Check food at (3,4): No.\n   - Safe move, no food.\n\n3. **Move Down (D)**:\n   - New head position: (3,3-1) = (3,2)\n   - Check walls/obstacles:\n     - y=2 is not a border.\n     - (3,2) is not an obstacle.\n   - Check food at (3,2): No.\n   - Safe move, no food.\n\n### Considering Food Positions\n\nNow, let's see which move brings us closer to food for future turns:\n\n1. **Food at (4,2)**:\n   - Current head: (3,3)\n   - Distance: |4-3| + |2-3| = 1 + 1 = 2\n   - To reach (4,2), possible path: Right then Down, but Right is not allowed now (instant reverse). So, Down then Right could work next turn.\n\n2. **Food at (1,3)**:\n   - Distance: |1-3| + |3-3| = 2 + 0 = 2\n   - Path: Left twice.\n\n3. **Food at (2,4)**:\n   - Distance: |2-3| + |4-3| = 1 + 1 = 2\n   - Path: Up then Left, or Left then Up.\n\n### Optimal Move\n\nGiven that all foods are equally valuable and have the same life span, and all moves are safe, we can choose the move that gets us closer to any food without immediate reward but setting up for future rewards.\n\n- Moving Left to (2,3):\n  - Next turn, can move Up to (2,4) to eat food there.\n  \n- Moving Up to (3,4):\n  - Next turn, can move Left to (2,4) to eat food there.\n  \n- Moving Down to (3,2):\n  - Next turn, can move Right to (4,2) to eat food there (but Right is allowed next turn since current direction would be Down, not Left).\n\nAll seem reasonable. Since the snake is currently facing Left, continuing Left maintains direction and sets up to reach (2,4) or (1,3) in subsequent moves. \n\nHowever, moving Left now to (2,3) allows moving Up next to (2,4) to eat the food there. Alternatively, moving Up now to (3,4) allows moving Left next to (2,4). Both sequences reach the food in two moves.\n\nGiven that, moving Left seems slightly better because it keeps the snake aligned towards the left side where two foods are located ((1,3) and (2,4)), whereas moving Down only aligns towards one food ((4,2)).\n\n### Checking for Immediate Food\n\nNone of the immediate moves lead to food, so the choice is about setting up future moves. \n\n### Avoiding Future Collisions\n\nSince the snake is length 1, no body collision is possible now. \n\n### Decision\n\nAfter considering all options, moving Left seems like a reasonable choice to position the snake closer to two food items without any immediate risk.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{L}",

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Problem\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario presented:\n\n1. **Game Grid**: It's a 2D grid with borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. There are also internal obstacles at specific coordinates.\n2. **Snake**: \n   - Current position: Only the head at (2, 3).\n   - Direction: Currently moving Left (L).\n3. **Food**: Four pieces of food with their positions, life spans, and values:\n   - (4, 2): value=9, life_span=1\n   - (1, 3): value=9, life_span=1\n   - (2, 4): value=9, life_span=1\n   - (6, 5): value=10, life_span=1\n\n### Initial Observations\n\n- The snake is just a head at (2, 3) moving left. Since it's only the head, there's no body to collide with yet.\n- The goal is to maximize the score by eating positive food while avoiding risks.\n- The food values are all positive (9 or 10), but they have a life span of 1, meaning they'll disappear after this turn if not eaten.\n\n### Possible Actions\n\nGiven the current direction is Left (L), the possible moves are:\n1. **Continue Left (L)**: Move to (1, 3).\n2. **Turn Up (U)**: Move to (2, 4).\n3. **Turn Down (D)**: Move to (2, 2).\n\n**Note**: Since the current direction is Left, the opposite direction is Right (R). According to the rules, we cannot make an instant reverse, so Right is not an option.\n\n### Evaluating Each Move\n\n#### 1. Move Left (L) to (1, 3)\n- **New Position**: (1, 3)\n- **Food Check**: There's food at (1, 3) with value=9.\n  - **Eating**: Yes, since the head moves onto the food.\n  - **Tail Reward Danger**: No, because the snake has no tail yet.\n- **Wall/Obstacle Check**: \n  - Borders: x=1 is within 0-7, y=3 is within 0-7.\n  - Internal Obstacles: (1, 2) and (1, 5) are obstacles, but (1, 3) is not listed as an obstacle.\n- **Outcome**: Safe move, and we eat the food, gaining +9 points.\n\n#### 2. Move Up (U) to (2, 4)\n- **New Position**: (2, 4)\n- **Food Check**: There's food at (2, 4) with value=9.\n  - **Eating**: Yes.\n  - **Tail Reward Danger**: No tail yet.\n- **Wall/Obstacle Check**: \n  - Borders: x=2 is within 0-7, y=4 is within 0-7.\n  - Internal Obstacles: (2, 6) is an obstacle, but (2, 4) is not.\n- **Outcome**: Safe move, and we eat the food, gaining +9 points.\n\n#### 3. Move Down (D) to (2, 2)\n- **New Position**: (2, 2)\n- **Food Check**: No food at (2, 2).\n- **Wall/Obstacle Check**: \n  - Borders: x=2 is within 0-7, y=2 is within 0-7.\n  - Internal Obstacles: (1, 2) is an obstacle, but (2, 2) is not.\n- **Outcome**: Safe move, but no food is eaten. Score remains unchanged.\n\n### Comparing Options\n\n- **Left (L)**: +9 points, safe.\n- **Up (U)**: +9 points, safe.\n- **Down (D)**: No points, safe.\n\nBoth Left and Up offer the same immediate reward. Now, I need to consider future implications.\n\n### Future Considerations\n\n1. **Left (L) to (1, 3)**:\n   - After moving left, the snake's head is at (1, 3).\n   - Possible next moves: Up (U), Down (D), or continue Left (L) (but x=0 is a wall, so Left is not possible next turn).\n   - Nearby food: (1, 3) is eaten, so next turn's food positions depend on new spawns.\n\n2. **Up (U) to (2, 4)**:\n   - After moving up, the snake's head is at (2, 4).\n   - Possible next moves: Left (L), Right (R), or continue Up (U).\n   - Nearby food: (2, 4) is eaten, so next turn's food positions depend on new spawns.\n\nBoth options seem equivalent in terms of immediate reward and future flexibility. However, moving Left keeps the snake closer to the center, which might be advantageous for future food collection.\n\n### Checking for Special Cases\n\n- **Food under body**: Not applicable here since the snake is just a head.\n- **Tail Reward Danger**: Not applicable here.\n\n### Decision\n\nSince both Left and Up offer the same immediate reward and similar future flexibility, I can choose either. For simplicity, I'll choose Left since it's the current direction, and changing direction isn't necessary unless it offers a better reward.\n\nHowever, looking again, the food at (1, 3) is directly in the path of moving Left, which is the current direction. Moving Left is the most straightforward choice.\n\n### Verifying No Immediate Reverse\n\nCurrent direction is Left (L). The opposite is Right (R), which is not allowed. But we're not considering Right, so it's fine.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nAfter careful consideration, the best immediate action is to continue moving Left to eat the food at (1, 3).\n\n\\boxed{L}",

So, the snake cannot move outside these bounds.\n   - **Internal Obstacles**: There are five internal walls at (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), and (2,6). The snake cannot move into these cells.\n3. **Snake**:\n   - **Positions**: The snake has two segments: head at (1,3) and body at (2,3).\n   - **Direction**: The head is currently moving Left (L).\n4. **Food**:\n   - Three pieces of food are present:\n     - (4,2): value=8, life_span=1\n     - (2,4): value=8, life_span=1\n     - (6,5): value=9, life_span=1\n   - All foods have a positive value (+1) since their values are positive (8,8,9), but the actual reward is +1 regardless of the value displayed (as per the rules).\n\n### Movement Constraints\n\n1. **Current Direction**: The snake is moving Left (L), so its head is at (1,3) and the next segment is at (2,3).\n2. **No Instant Reverse**: Since the current direction is Left, the snake cannot move Right (R) in the next turn.\n   - Allowed moves: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L).\n3. **Possible Moves**:\n   - **Left (L)**: (x-1, y) → (0,3)\n     - Check for walls: x=0 is a border wall → Invalid (collision).\n   - **Up (U)**: (x, y+1) → (1,4)\n     - Check for walls: (1,4) is not a wall → Valid.\n     - Check for body collision: Snake body is at (2,3) → No collision.\n   - **Down (D)**: (x, y-1) → (1,2)\n     - Check for walls: (1,2) is an internal obstacle → Invalid (collision).\n\n### Food Considerations\n\nNow, let's look at the food positions relative to the possible moves:\n\n1. **Up (U) to (1,4)**:\n   - Is there food at (1,4)? No.\n   - Closest food: (2,4) is adjacent to (1,4).\n     - Moving Up doesn't directly eat food but positions the snake closer to (2,4).\n2. **Left (L)**: Invalid due to wall collision.\n3. **Down (D)**: Invalid due to wall collision.\n\nSince only Up is a valid move, the decision seems straightforward. However, I need to ensure that moving Up doesn't lead to any immediate dangers.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger Check\n\nThe rules mention a special case where if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake. \n\n- Current tail is at (2,3).\n- Adjacent cells to tail: (1,3), (3,3), (2,2), (2,4).\n- Head is at (1,3), which is adjacent to the tail (2,3).\n- Is there food at the tail (2,3)? No, food is at (2,4), (4,2), (6,5).\n- Therefore, no danger from tail reward.\n\n### Future Considerations\n\nSince the snake is short (length=2), it's flexible. Moving Up to (1,4) is safe and positions the head closer to the food at (2,4). Next turn, the snake could move Right to (2,4) to eat the food.\n\n### Verifying Other Options\n\nAre there any other considerations?\n\n- Food lifespan: All foods have a life_span of 1, meaning they will disappear after this turn if not eaten. However, the countdown decreases every turn, including the current one. So, at turn t0=2, the life_span is 1, meaning they will disappear after this turn.\n  - But the rule says \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n  - So, if life_span is 1 at t0=2, it will be 0 at t0=3, meaning it disappears at t0=3.\n  - Therefore, the food is still available to be eaten in the current turn (t0=2).\n\nBut since the food is not directly under the head, the snake cannot eat it immediately. It needs to move towards it.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe only valid move is Up (U). It's safe and positions the snake closer to the food at (2,4), which can be eaten in the next turn if the snake moves Right.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter evaluating all possible moves and considering the constraints, the best immediate action is to move Up.\n\n\\boxed{U}",

Moving here would cause a collision.\n   - Invalid move.\n\n4. **Right (R) to (3,4)**:\n   - Check for walls: x=7 is the right wall, (3,4) is not a wall.\n   - Check for obstacles: (3,4) is not in the internal obstacles list.\n   - Check for body: No body segments at (3,4).\n   - Valid move.\n\n### Considering Food\n\nNow, let's see if any food is adjacent to the head (2,4):\n\nAdjacent cells to (2,4):\n- Up: (2,5) — no food.\n- Down: (2,3) — no food.\n- Left: (1,4) — body, no food.\n- Right: (3,4) — no food.\n\nThe closest foods are:\n- (4,2): distance of |4-2| + |2-4| = 2 + 2 = 4.\n- (6,5): distance of |6-2| + |5-4| = 4 + 1 = 5.\n- (2,2): distance of |2-2| + |2-4| = 0 + 2 = 2.\n\nThe closest is (2,2), which is directly below the head at (2,4). To reach (2,2), we'd need to move down twice:\n- First move: Down to (2,3).\n- Second move: Down to (2,2).\n\nBut we can only decide the immediate next move. Moving down now to (2,3) is a step towards (2,2).\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nAt (2,2), there's positive food. The tail is at (1,3). After moving down to (2,3), the next move down to (2,2) would eat the food, increasing the snake's length. The new tail would be at (1,4) (since the snake grows by one, the tail doesn't move). \n\nNow, after eating at (2,2), the snake would be:\n- Head at (2,2), body at (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), tail at (1,3).\n\nIs the head adjacent to the tail after this? \n- Head at (2,2), tail at (1,3): distance is |2-1| + |2-3| = 1 + 1 = 2, not adjacent (adjacent means distance 1).\nWait, adjacent means sharing a side, so (2,2) is adjacent to (1,2), (3,2), (2,1), (2,3). (1,3) is diagonally adjacent, which may or may not count as adjacent in this context. Assuming \"adjacent\" means Manhattan distance of 1 (up, down, left, right), then (1,3) is not adjacent to (2,2).\n\nBut the rule says: \"If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake.\" Here, the tail is at (1,3), and we're eating at (2,2), not at the tail. So this doesn't apply.\n\n### Evaluating Other Moves\n\nAlternative to moving towards (2,2), we could move right to (3,4), which is away from food but safe. However, moving right doesn't bring us closer to any food immediately.\n\nMoving up to (2,5) is safe but doesn't approach any food directly.\n\n### Decision\n\nThe most promising move seems to be Down (D) towards the closest food at (2,2). It's safe, doesn't cause immediate collision, and moves towards food.\n\n### Verifying Immediate Collision\n\nAfter moving Down to (2,3):\n- New head: (2,3)\n- Body: (2,4), (1,4)\n- Tail: (1,3)\nNo collision with body or walls.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter considering all options, the best immediate action is to move Down (D) towards the closest food at (2,2).\n\n\\boxed{D}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n1. **Current Turn**: 5\n2. **Walls**:\n   - Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (so the grid is 8x8 from (0,0) to (7,7))\n   - Internal obstacles: (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6)\n3. **Snake Positions**:\n   - Head: (2,3)\n   - Body: [(2,4), (1,4)]\n   - So the snake is three segments long: head at (2,3), then (2,4), then (1,4)\n4. **Snake Head Direction**: Currently moving Down (D)\n5. **Food Items**:\n   - (4,2): value=1, life_span=5\n   - (6,5): value=1, life_span=6\n   - (2,2): value=1, life_span=9\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (2,3) and moving Down (D), the possible next moves are:\n- **Left (L)**: (1,3)\n- **Right (R)**: (3,3)\n- **Down (D)**: (2,2)\n  \nWe cannot move Up (U) because that would be the opposite of the current direction (D), which is not allowed (\"No instant reverse\").\n\n### Evaluating Each Possible Move\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move for safety and potential to eat food.\n\n#### 1. Move Left (L) to (1,3)\n- **Check for collisions**:\n  - Walls: (1,3) is not a wall (internal obstacles are at (1,2) and (1,5), borders are at x=0,7 and y=0,7)\n  - Body: Snake body is at (2,4) and (1,4). (1,3) is not part of the body.\n- **Food**: \n  - No food at (1,3)\n- **Safety**: Safe move, no immediate risks.\n- **Future considerations**: Moving left might not be towards any food, but it's safe.\n\n#### 2. Move Right (R) to (3,3)\n- **Check for collisions**:\n  - Walls: (3,3) is not a wall.\n  - Body: Not part of the body.\n- **Food**: \n  - No food at (3,3)\n- **Safety**: Safe move.\n- **Future considerations**: Moves towards the center, but not directly towards any food.\n\n#### 3. Move Down (D) to (2,2)\n- **Check for collisions**:\n  - Walls: (2,2) is not a wall.\n  - Body: Snake body is at (2,4) and (1,4). (2,2) is not part of the body.\n- **Food**: \n  - There is food at (2,2) with value=1, life_span=9.\n- **Eating the food**:\n  - The food is positive (+1 score, length +1).\n  - Check for \"Tail Reward Danger\":\n    - Tail is at (1,4). Is (1,4) adjacent to head (2,3)? \n      - Adjacent means sharing an edge (up, down, left, right). (1,4) is left of (2,4), but head is at (2,3), so (1,4) is not adjacent to (2,3) (it's diagonally up-left).\n      - Actually, adjacency is up, down, left, right. Distance from (2,3) to (1,4) is sqrt(1 + 1) = sqrt(2), not 1, so not adjacent.\n    - So no tail reward danger.\n- **Safety**: Safe to eat the food.\n- **Future considerations**: Eating food increases length, which could make future movements more constrained, but currently safe.\n\n### Comparing Moves\n\n- Moving Down (D) to (2,2) allows eating positive food without any immediate danger.\n- Moving Left (L) or Right (R) are safe but don't provide any immediate benefit (no food).\n  \nGiven that the goal is to maximize score by eating positive food while avoiding risks, the best immediate action is to move Down to eat the food at (2,2).\n\n### Verifying Tail Reward Danger Again\n\nJust to be thorough, let's confirm the tail reward danger:\n- After eating the food at (2,2), the snake will grow by 1 segment.\n  - Current length: 3 (head at (2,3), then (2,4), then (1,4))\n  - After eating: length 4\n  - New tail will be where the current tail was, but since the tail moves forward, the new tail would be at (1,4) only if the tail didn't move, but actually, the tail moves forward when the head moves, so:\n    - Original: [(2,3), (2,4), (1,4)]\n    - Move D to (2,2): new head at (2,2), then (2,3), (2,4), tail (1,4) is removed (since length was 3, now 4, so tail stays and new segment is added at head's previous position?)\n    - Wait, snake movement: head moves to (2,2), then each segment follows the previous one.\n      - New positions: [(2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4)] (length 4)\n      - Tail is at (1,4)\n    - Next turn, if we move, the tail (1,4) will move to where (2,4) was, but since we're adding a segment, the tail stays, and the new segment is added where the head was.\n    - So no immediate collision from growing.\n- The key is that the tail is not adjacent to the head when eating the food at (2,2), so no danger.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter evaluating all possible moves, the best immediate action is to move Down (D) to eat the positive food at (2,2).\n\n\\boxed{D}",

        "thinking": "Alright, let's tackle this Snake game scenario step by step. I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**Current Turn**: 6  \n**Walls**:\n- Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (so the grid is from (1,1) to (6,6) excluding internal obstacles)\n- Internal obstacles: (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6)\n\n**Snake Positions**: \n- Head: (2,2)\n- Body: [(2,3), (2,4), (1,4)]\n  \nSo, the snake's body segments are at:\n- (2,3) - directly above the head (since head is at (2,2) and direction is D (down))\n- (2,4) - above (2,3)\n- (1,4) - to the left of (2,4)\n\n**Snake Head Direction**: D (down)  \nThis means the snake was moving downward in the previous move. The \"no instant reverse\" rule means we can't move upward (U) next, as that would be the opposite direction.\n\n**Food**:\n1. (4,2): value = 4, life_span = 1\n   - This means it's positive food (+1 score, +1 length), and it will disappear after this turn if not eaten.\n2. (6,5): value = 5, life_span = 1\n   - Similarly, positive food, disappears after this turn.\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the head at (2,2), current direction is D (down), so last move was down. Possible moves now are:\n- Left (L): (1,2)\n- Right (R): (3,2)\n- Down (D): (2,1) \n  \nCannot go Up (U) because that would be reversing the direction from D to U, which is not allowed.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each possible move:\n\n#### 1. Move Left (L) to (1,2)\n- Check for walls: (1,2) is an internal obstacle → cannot move here.  \nSo, L is invalid.\n\n#### 2. Move Right (R) to (3,2)\n- Check walls: (3,2) is not listed as a wall or obstacle.\n- Check body collision:\n  - Snake body is at (2,3), (2,4), (1,4) — none of these are (3,2).\n- Check if food is at (3,2): No, food is at (4,2) and (6,5).\n  \nThis move is safe. No immediate reward, but safe.\n\n#### 3. Move Down (D) to (2,1)\n- Check walls: y=0 is a border, but (2,1) is y=1, which is within bounds.\n- Check internal obstacles: (2,1) is not listed.\n- Check body collision: Snake body is at (2,3), (2,4), (1,4) — none at (2,1).\n- Check food: No food at (2,1).\n  \nThis move is also safe.\n\n### Considering Food\n\nNow, let's see if we can reach any food this turn.\n\n**Food at (4,2)**:\n- Current head: (2,2)\n- To reach (4,2), need to move right twice (from (2,2) to (3,2) to (4,2)).\n- But we can only move once per turn. So cannot reach it this turn.\n- However, its life_span is 1, so it will disappear after this turn. So next turn it won't be there.\n\n**Food at (6,5)**:\n- Current head: (2,2)\n- Distance is 4 in x and 3 in y. Cannot reach in one move.\n- Life_span is 1, so will disappear after this turn.\n\nSo, no food can be eaten this turn regardless of move.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger\n\nCheck if the tail has positive food that could be dangerous:\n- Tail is at (1,4). Is there food at (1,4)?\n  - Food positions are (4,2) and (6,5), so no.\n- Also, the head is at (2,2), tail at (1,4). They are not adjacent (distance is sqrt((2-1)^2 + (2-4)^2) = sqrt(1 + 4) = sqrt(5) > 1), so no adjacency danger.\n\n### Future Moves Consideration\n\nSince no food can be eaten this turn, the main goal is to position the snake favorably for future moves.\n\nCurrent possible safe moves: R to (3,2) or D to (2,1).\n\nLet's see which is better for future food access:\n\n- Moving R to (3,2):\n  - Next turn, from (3,2), possible moves:\n    - U (to (3,3)) — but current direction is D, so U would be reverse, not allowed.\n    - L (to (2,2)) — but that's where the body is at (2,3) is adjacent to (2,2), but the body will move forward, so (2,2) will be empty next turn (since tail is at (1,4), and body moves from (2,3)->(2,2), (2,4)->(2,3), (1,4)->(2,4), so (1,4) is new tail).\n    - D (to (3,1))\n    - R (to (4,2)) — where food is, but food will be gone by then.\n  \n  So, moving R now doesn't seem to lead to immediate food next turn.\n\n- Moving D to (2,1):\n  - Next turn, from (2,1), possible moves:\n    - L (to (1,1)) — but (1,2) is an obstacle, (1,1) is border? Wait, borders are x=0/x=7, y=0/y=7, so (1,1) is valid unless internal obstacle. It's not listed, so valid.\n    - R (to (3,1))\n    - D (to (2,0)) — y=0 is wall, so invalid.\n  \n  Current direction is D, so cannot go U (to (2,2)) as reverse.\n  \n  Moving D now seems to keep options open for next turn, but no immediate advantage.\n\n### Avoiding Dead Ends\n\nWe should also avoid moving into positions that might trap the snake soon.\n\nCurrently, the snake is in the lower left area. Moving D to (2,1) is near the border, which might limit future moves. Moving R to (3,2) seems more central, giving more options next turn.\n\n### Decision\n\nBetween R and D, both are safe this turn. R seems slightly better as it keeps the snake more central, avoiding being too close to the border.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{R}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**Current Turn**: 7  \n**Walls**:\n- Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (so the grid is 8x8 from (0,0) to (7,7))\n- Internal obstacles: (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6)\n\n**Snake Positions**: [(3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4)]\n- Head is at (3,2), direction is Right (R)\n- Body segments: (2,2), (2,3), (2,4)\n\n**Food**:\n1. (4,2): value=3, life_span=1\n2. (6,5): value=4, 1\n3. (6,2): value=10, 1\n\n### Visualizing the Snake and Food\n\nLet's visualize the snake's position and the food:\n\n- Snake:\n  - Head: (3,2) facing Right\n  - Body: (2,2), (2,3), (2,4)\n  \n  So the snake's body is mostly going upwards from (2,2) to (2,4).\n\n- Food:\n  - (4,2): Right in front of the head (since head is at (3,2) facing Right)\n  - (6,5): Further right and up\n  - (6,2): Further right on the same row as the head\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However:\n- Current direction is Right (R), so we cannot instantly reverse to Left (L) next turn.\n- So possible moves: U, D, R\n\nNow, let's evaluate each possible move:\n\n1. **Right (R)**:\n   - New head position: (3+1, 2) = (4,2)\n   - (4,2) is a food position with value=3, life_span=1\n   - Check if eating this food is safe:\n     - After eating, the snake grows by 1, so new tail will be where the current tail is (2,4) doesn't move, but since we're adding a segment, the new tail will be the old last segment (2,4), and the segment before that (2,3) becomes the new tail.\n     - The head moves to (4,2), body becomes [(4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3)]\n     - Is the head adjacent to the new tail (2,3)? Distance between (4,2) and (2,3):\n       - |4-2|=2, |2-3|=1, so total distance is 3 (not adjacent, since adjacent is distance of 1)\n     - So no immediate collision.\n     - Also, (4,2) is not a wall or obstacle.\n   - Seems safe to eat this food.\n\n2. **Up (U)**:\n   - New head position: (3, 2+1) = (3,3)\n   - Check if (3,3) is safe:\n     - Not a body segment: body is at (2,2), (2,3), (2,4) — (3,3) is not in body.\n     - Not a wall: walls are at borders and internal obstacles — (3,3) is not listed.\n     - No food at (3,3).\n   - Safe move, but doesn't eat food.\n\n3. **Down (D)**:\n   - New head position: (3, 2-1) = (3,1)\n   - Check safety:\n     - Not in body.\n     - Not a wall: y=0 is a wall, but (3,1) is not.\n     - No food at (3,1).\n   - Safe move, but no food.\n\n### Comparing Moves\n\n- Right (R):\n  - Eats food at (4,2) with value=3, life_span=1 (will disappear next turn if not eaten now)\n  - Safe to eat, no collision risks.\n  \n- Up (U) and Down (D):\n  - Safe but no immediate benefit.\n\nOther food:\n- (6,5) and (6,2) are further away. Moving towards them would require multiple moves, and their life spans are 4 and 10 respectively, so they'll last longer.\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nThe \"Tail Reward Danger\" rule states that if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nIn our case:\n- Current tail is at (2,4)\n- Food is at (4,2), not at the tail.\n- So no danger from this rule here.\n\n### Decision\n\nThe best immediate action is to move Right (R) to eat the food at (4,2) with value=3, which is about to disappear next turn (life_span=1). This is safe and maximizes the immediate score gain.\n\nOther moves are safe but don't provide immediate benefits. The other foods are further away and have longer life spans, so we can consider them in future turns.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{R}",

However:\n\n- **No instant reverse**: Since the current direction is R, the opposite direction L is not allowed in the next move.\n  \nSo, allowed moves: U, D, R\n\nLet's evaluate each:\n\n#### 1. Move Right (R) to (5, 2)\n\n- New head position: (5, 2)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: x=7 is the right border, so (5,2) is not a wall.\n  - Internal obstacles: (5,2) is not in the list [(4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6)].\n  - Body collision: Snake body is at [(3, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4)]. (5,2) is not in this list.\n  \n- Food at (5,2): There is no food at (5,2), so no eating.\n  \n- Tail movement: The tail is at (2,4). After moving, the new tail will be at (2,3), so no immediate collision with the new head.\n\nThis move is safe but doesn't eat food.\n\n#### 2. Move Up (U) to (4, 3)\n\n- New head position: (4, 3)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: y=7 is the top border, (4,3) is safe.\n  - Internal obstacles: (4,3) is not in the list.\n  - Body collision: (4,3) is not in [(3, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4)].\n  \n- Food at (4,3): No food here.\n  \n- Tail movement: Tail moves to (2,3), so no collision.\n\nThis move is safe but doesn't eat food.\n\n#### 3. Move Down (D) to (4, 1)\n\n- New head position: (4, 1)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: y=0 is the bottom border, but (4,1) is y=1, so safe.\n  - Internal obstacles: (4,1) is in the list [(4,1)], so this is a wall. **Collision!**\n  \nThis move is invalid due to wall collision.\n\n### Considering Food\n\nNow, let's see if any food can be eaten safely in the next move.\n\n1. **Food at (6,5)**:\n   - Distance from head (4,2): Δx=2, Δy=3. Cannot reach in one move.\n   \n2. **Food at (6,2)**:\n   - Distance from head (4,2): Δx=2, Δy=0. Can reach in two moves right (R twice).\n   - Next move R to (5,2), then R to (6,2).\n   - Need to check if eating (6,2) is safe:\n     - Current tail is at (2,4). After two moves:\n       - Move 1: Head to (5,2), tail to (2,3)\n       - Move 2: Head to (6,2), tail to (2,2)\n     - After eating, snake grows by 1, so new tail is at (2,3).\n     - New head at (6,2), body: [(5,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3)]\n     - Check adjacency to tail: Tail is at (2,3), head at (6,2). Not adjacent (distance is 4 horizontally and 1 vertically), so no immediate collision.\n     - Also, (6,2) is not under the snake's body currently, so no special case applies.\n   \n   However, we can only decide the immediate next move, not plan two moves ahead. So, moving towards (6,2) is a potential goal, but we must choose the immediate move that's safe and progresses towards it.\n\n### Evaluating Immediate Moves Towards Food\n\nFrom (4,2), to reach (6,2), the immediate move is R to (5,2).\n\n- As evaluated earlier, R to (5,2) is safe.\n- Next move could be R to (6,2) to eat the food, provided nothing changes.\n\nAlternative is U or D, but they don't progress towards food.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Food Under Head\n\nIs there any food under the snake's body that could be eaten by moving away and then back?\n\n- Current head is at (4,2). Is there food at (4,2)? No.\n- Other body parts: (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4). Food is at (6,5) and (6,2), none under body.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger\n\nIs the head adjacent to the tail, and is there positive food at the tail?\n\n- Tail is at (2,4).\n- Head is at (4,2). Distance: Δx=2, Δy=2. Not adjacent (adjacent means Δx + Δy = 1).\n- So no danger from this rule.\n\n### Life Span of Food\n\n- (6,5): life_span=3, current turn=8. Will disappear at turn=8+3=11.\n- (6,2): life_span=9, disappears at turn=17.\n  \nBoth foods will persist after this move, so no urgency based on life span.\n\n### Decision\n\nGiven the above:\n\n- Move R to (5,2) is safe and progresses towards the food at (6,2).\n- Move U is safe but doesn't progress towards food.\n- Move D is invalid.\n  \nBest immediate action is to move Right (R) towards the food at (6,2).\n\n\\boxed{R}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding any risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**Current Turn**: 9  \n**Walls**:\n- Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (so the grid is from x=1 to x=6 and y=1 to y=6, but wait, no: the borders are at x=0 and x=7, meaning the playable area is x=1 to x=6, y=1 to y=6).\n- Internal obstacles: (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6)\n\n**Snake Positions**: [(5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3)]  \n- Head is at (5,2), direction is R (right).\n- Body segments: (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3) (tail is at (2,3)).\n\n**Food**:\n1. (6,5): value=2, life_span=1\n2. (6,2): value=8, life_span=1\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nThe snake's current direction is R (right). From the head at (5,2), possible moves are:\n- Right (R): (6,2)\n- Up (U): (5,3)\n- Down (D): (5,1)\n- Left (L): (4,2) — but this is the opposite of current direction (R), so it's not allowed (no instant reverse).\n\nSo, allowed moves: R, U, D.\n\n### Evaluating Each Move\n\n**1. Move Right (R) to (6,2)**:\n- New head position: (6,2)\n- Check for food: (6,2) has food with value=8, life_span=1.\n  - Eating this food: +8 to score, length increases by 1.\n  - Check for Tail Reward Danger: The tail is at (2,3), which is not adjacent to (6,2), so no danger.\n  - After eating, the new tail would be the old tail (since length increases by 1), but the tail moves forward from (2,3) to (2,2) (as the body moves).\n  - No collision with body or walls: (6,2) is not a wall (border is x=7), and not in body segments.\n- However, the food at (6,2) has life_span=1, meaning it will disappear after this turn if not eaten now. High value (8) makes this very attractive.\n\n**2. Move Up (U) to (5,3)**:\n- New head position: (5,3)\n- Check for food: no food here.\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: (5,3) is not a wall.\n  - Body: Check if (5,3) is in body segments: [(4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3)] — no, so safe.\n- But no immediate reward, and we're missing the high-value food.\n\n**3. Move Down (D) to (5,1)**:\n- New head position: (5,1)\n- Check for food: no food here.\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: y=0 is a wall, but (5,1) is y=1, so not a wall.\n  - Body: (5,1) is not in body segments.\n- No reward, and not moving towards any food.\n\n### Considering Food Lifespans\n\n- (6,5): life_span=1 — will disappear after this turn if not eaten now.\n- (6,2): life_span=1 — same.\n\nBut (6,2) is directly reachable by moving right, and it's high value (8). (6,5) is at (6,5), which is two moves away (right then up), but we can't reach it in time since its life_span is 1.\n\n### Potential Risks\n\nMoving right to (6,2):\n- Next turn, the snake's head is at (6,2), body will be [(6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2)] (tail was (2,3), moves to (2,2)).\n- Possible next moves from (6,2):\n  - Right: (7,2) — x=7 is a wall, so invalid.\n  - Up: (6,3)\n  - Down: (6,1)\n  - Left: (5,2) — but this is the body segment (5,2), which would collide unless the tail moves away. Wait, the body after moving right is [(6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2)], so (5,2) is the next segment. Moving left to (5,2) would collide with the body immediately, so left is invalid next turn.\n  \nSo after moving right, next turn the only options are up or down, which are safe as long as we don't hit walls or body.\n\n### Alternative Consideration\n\nIs there a reason not to go for the high-value food at (6,2)?\n- It's safe to eat now (no tail reward danger).\n- The only downside is that after eating, the snake is longer, which might make future movements more constrained, but the immediate +8 is very tempting.\n\nOther moves (U or D) don't give any points, and the other food at (6,5) is too far to reach before it disappears.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Collisions\n\nCurrent body segments: [(4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3)]\n- Moving to (6,2): not in body, not a wall — safe.\n- Moving to (5,3): not in body, not a wall — safe but no reward.\n- Moving to (5,1): not in body, not a wall — safe but no reward.\n\n### Decision\n\nThe best immediate action is to move right to (6,2) to eat the high-value food (+8) before it disappears, and it's safe to do so now.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{R}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**Grid Dimensions and Walls:**\n- The grid is 8x8 (since x and y range from 0 to 7).\n- Border walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So, the snake cannot move beyond these coordinates.\n- Internal obstacles (walls) are at: (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6). These are additional cells the snake cannot move into.\n\n**Snake:**\n- Positions (head first): [(6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3)]\n  - Head is at (6,2).\n  - The body segments follow: (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), and the tail is at (2,3).\n- Current direction: Right (R). This means the snake was moving to the right in the previous move.\n\n**Food:**\n1. (6,5): value = 1 (positive), life_span = 1.\n   - This means it will disappear after this turn if not eaten now.\n2. (5,4): value = 1 (positive), life_span = 10.\n   - It will stay for 10 more turns after this one.\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (6,2) and current direction R, the possible moves are:\n- **Right (R)**: (7,2) → x=7 is a border wall → collision → invalid.\n- **Up (U)**: (6,3) → need to check if this is safe.\n- **Down (D)**: (6,1) → need to check if this is safe.\n- **Left (L)**: (5,2) → this is the body segment immediately after the head → collision → invalid (unless it's the tail, but here it's not; the tail is at (2,3)).\n\nSo, possible valid moves are U and D.\n\n### Checking Move Up (U) to (6,3)\n\n- Is (6,3) a wall? Border walls are at y=0 and y=7, so no.\n- Internal obstacles: check the list — (6,3) is not there.\n- Is (6,3) part of the snake's body? Snake positions are:\n  - (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3) → (6,3) is not in this list → safe.\n  \nNow, is there food at (6,3)? Food is at (6,5) and (5,4) → no food at (6,3) → no eating, just moving.\n\nAfter moving up:\n- New head: (6,3).\n- Body segments shift: (6,2) becomes first body, (5,2) next, etc., and the tail (2,3) moves away (since the snake moves forward, the tail segment at (2,3) would be removed unless the snake eats and grows).\n  \nThis move seems safe with no immediate reward.\n\n### Checking Move Down (D) to (6,1)\n\n- Is (6,1) a wall? y=1 is not a border wall (y=0 is).\n- Internal obstacles: (4,1) is one, but (6,1) is not listed → safe.\n- Is (6,1) part of the snake's body? Checking the list → no → safe.\n  \nIs there food at (6,1)? No food listed there → no eating.\n\nAfter moving down:\n- New head: (6,1).\n- Body shifts similarly to the up move.\n\nThis is also safe with no immediate reward.\n\n### Considering Food\n\nNow, let's look at the food positions to see if we can aim for them:\n\n1. (6,5): value=1, life_span=1 (will disappear after this turn if not eaten now).\n   - Current head is at (6,2). To reach (6,5) in one move is impossible (need to move up 3 steps).\n   - So, cannot eat this food this turn → it will disappear after this turn regardless.\n\n2. (5,4): value=1, life_span=10.\n   - Current head is at (6,2). To reach (5,4):\n     - Need to go left to (5,2), then up to (5,3), then up to (5,4) — but that's two moves away.\n     - Cannot reach in one move.\n   - So, cannot eat this food this turn either.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger Check\n\nThe rule states: if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nCurrent tail is at (2,3). Adjacent cells to tail:\n- (1,3), (3,3), (2,2), (2,4).\nHead is at (6,2) — not adjacent to tail (distance is |6-2| + |2-3| = 4 + 1 = 5, not adjacent).\nSo, no danger from this rule in current position.\n\n### Evaluating Moves U and D\n\nBoth U and D are safe with no immediate food to eat. Which is better?\n\nLooking at future possibilities:\n\n- Moving Up to (6,3):\n  - Next moves could be towards (5,4) food: from (6,3), can go left to (5,3), then up to (5,4).\n  \n- Moving Down to (6,1):\n  - Next moves: could go left to (5,1), but (5,4) is above, would take longer to reach.\n  \nSeems moving up keeps us closer to the (5,4) food, which is the only remaining food after this turn (since (6,5) disappears).\n\n### Checking for Immediate Dangers After Move\n\nAfter moving up to (6,3):\n- Next turn, direction is U (if we choose U now).\n- Possible moves then: cannot reverse to D (no instant reverse), so can go U, L, R.\n  \nAfter moving down to (6,1):\n- Next turn, direction is D.\n- Possible moves: cannot go U, so D, L, R.\n\nBoth seem safe, but up seems more promising for future food.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nBetween U and D, both are safe, but U seems slightly better for future food access. Also, moving down to (6,1) is closer to the bottom wall (y=0), which might limit future movements more than moving up.\n\n### Verifying No Immediate Reverse\n\nCurrent direction is R. Possible moves are U, D, L, R.\n- R is invalid (wall).\n- L is into body (invalid unless tail, but it's not).\nSo, only U and D are valid, neither is opposite to R (opposite would be L), so both are allowed.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe best immediate action is to move **Up (U)**.\n\n\\boxed{U}",

        "thinking": "Alright, let's tackle this Snake game scenario step by step. I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The grid is 8x8 (from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7).\n2. **Walls**:\n   - Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (so the snake can't go beyond these).\n   - Internal obstacles at: (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6).\n3. **Snake**:\n   - Positions: Head at (6,3), then (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2).\n   - Current direction: Up (U).\n4. **Food**:\n   - Only one piece at (5,4) with value=1 (positive), life_span=10.\n\n### Visualizing the Snake and Food\n\nLet me sketch the snake's position to understand better:\n\n- Head: (6,3)\n- Body: (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2)\n\nThe snake is moving upwards (from (6,2) to (6,3)), so its previous move was from (6,2) to (6,3).\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (6,3), moving Up (U) would go to (6,4). But since the current direction is U, moving Up is allowed, but moving Down (opposite) is not allowed (no instant reverse).\n\nSo possible moves:\n- Up (U): (6,4)\n- Left (L): (5,3)\n- Right (R): (7,3)\n\nDown is not allowed because it's the opposite of current direction (U).\n\n### Checking Each Possible Move\n\n1. **Move Up (U) to (6,4)**:\n   - Check walls: (6,4) is within borders, no internal obstacle there.\n   - Check snake body: The body segments are at (6,2), (5,2), etc. (6,4) is not in the body.\n   - Food: (5,4) is not at (6,4), so no food eaten.\n   - Safe move.\n\n2. **Move Left (L) to (5,3)**:\n   - Walls: (5,3) is clear.\n   - Body: Not in body.\n   - Food: (5,4) is not at (5,3), no food.\n   - Safe move.\n\n3. **Move Right (R) to (7,3)**:\n   - Walls: x=7 is a border wall, so (7,3) is a wall. Can't move there.\n   - Invalid move.\n\n### Considering Food\n\nThere's positive food at (5,4). Let's see if we can reach it:\n\n- From (6,3), to reach (5,4):\n   - First move Left to (5,3), then next turn could move Up to (5,4).\n   - But we're only deciding the immediate action now.\n\nAlternatively, if we move Up to (6,4), then next turn from (6,4) we could move Left to (5,4) to eat the food.\n\nBut the food's life_span is 10, and current turn is 11. Assuming it spawned at turn 1, it would disappear at turn 11, meaning it's still there this turn (since countdown includes current turn). So we can eat it this turn if possible.\n\nBut from (6,3), we can't reach (5,4) in one move. So can't eat it this turn.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger\n\nCheck if the tail is adjacent to the head and has positive food:\n- Tail is at (2,2).\n- Head is at (6,3).\n- Distance: |6-2| + |3-2| = 4 + 1 = 5, not adjacent (adjacent would be distance 1).\n- So no danger from tail food.\n\n### Deciding the Best Move\n\nOptions:\n- Up (U): (6,4) - safe, moves towards center.\n- Left (L): (5,3) - safe, moves towards food (next turn can go up to (5,4)).\n\nMoving Left seems better because it positions us to potentially eat the food next turn.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Dangers\n\nIs there any immediate danger in moving Left to (5,3)?\n- Next turn, from (5,3), possible moves:\n   - Up to (5,4) - to eat food.\n   - Left to (4,3) - but (4,3) is not a wall or body.\n   - Right to (6,3) - but that's the previous head position, which is now body at (6,2), but (6,3) is not body (body is (6,2), etc., and tail moves away).\n   - Down to (5,2) - but (5,2) is body, so can't go there.\n\nSo next turn from (5,3), best would be Up to (5,4) to eat food.\n\n### Verifying Food Eating Safety\n\nIf we eat at (5,4):\n- Current length is 6 (from positions list).\n- Eating adds +1 length, so new length 7.\n- New tail would be where the current tail was at (2,2), but since we're adding a segment, the tail moves to (5,2) (as the body extends).\n- Head at (5,4), new body segments: (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2) - but wait, original body is (6,2), (5,2), etc., so after moving head to (5,3), then to (5,4), the body would be (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), and new tail is (2,2) is lost, new tail is (3,2).\n- No immediate collision after eating.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBest immediate action is to move Left (L) to (5,3), setting up to eat the positive food at (5,4) next turn.\n\n\\boxed{L}",

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Problem\n\nFirst, I need to understand the current state of the Snake game based on the provided information. Here's what I gather:\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The game is played on an 8x8 grid (since x and y range from 0 to 7).\n2. **Walls**: \n   - **Border walls**: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. These are the edges of the grid.\n   - **Internal obstacles**: (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6). These are additional walls inside the grid.\n3. **Snake**:\n   - **Positions**: The snake's body segments are listed from head to tail: [(5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2)].\n     - Head is at (5,3).\n     - Tail is at (3,2).\n   - **Direction**: The head is currently moving Left (L).\n4. **Food**:\n   - There's one piece of food at (5,4) with a value of +1 and a life span of 9 turns.\n\n### Visualizing the Snake and Food\n\nTo better understand, I'll sketch a simple representation of the grid with the snake and food:\n\n```\ny=7: -----------------\n...\ny=4: |   |   |   | F |   |   |   |   |  (F at (5,4))\ny=3: |   |   |   | H | B |   |   |   |  (H at (5,3), B at (6,3))\ny=2: |   | W |   | T | B | B | W |   |  (W at (1,2) and (2,6), T at (3,2), B at (4,2), (5,2), (6,2))\ny=1: |   | W |   |   | W |   |   |   |  (W at (1,5) and (4,1))\ny=0: -----------------\nx:   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n```\n\n(Note: This is a rough sketch; H=head, B=body, T=tail, W=wall, F=food.)\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However, since the current direction is Left (L), the snake cannot instantly reverse to Right (R) (rule: \"No instant reverse\").\n\nSo, possible moves are: U, D, L.\n\nNow, let's check each possible move for safety and potential to eat food.\n\n#### 1. Move Left (L) - Current Direction\n- New head position: (5,3) + (-1,0) = (4,3)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - **Walls**: \n    - x=4 is not a border wall (x=0 and x=7 are borders).\n    - Internal walls at (4,6) and (4,1) - not (4,3).\n  - **Body**: \n    - Snake body segments: (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2).\n    - (4,3) is not in the body.\n- **Food**: \n  - Food is at (5,4). Moving Left doesn't reach it.\n- **Conclusion**: Safe move, but doesn't eat food.\n\n#### 2. Move Up (U)\n- New head position: (5,3) + (0,1) = (5,4)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - **Walls**: \n    - y=4 is not a border wall (y=0 and y=7 are borders).\n    - No internal walls at (5,4).\n  - **Body**: \n    - (5,4) is not in the body.\n  - **Food**: \n    - Food is at (5,4). \n    - Check \"Tail Reward Danger\": \n      - Tail is at (3,2). Adjacent cells to tail are (2,2), (4,2), (3,1), (3,3).\n      - Head is moving to (5,4), which is not adjacent to tail (distance is more than 1).\n      - So, no danger from tail reward.\n    - Eating food: \n      - Value is +1, so it's positive food.\n      - Snake length increases by 1.\n      - New head at (5,4), body extends to include old head (5,3), etc.\n- **Conclusion**: Safe move, eats positive food, increases score.\n\n#### 3. Move Down (D)\n- New head position: (5,3) + (0,-1) = (5,2)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - **Walls**: \n    - y=2 is not a border wall.\n    - Internal walls: (5,2) is not listed as a wall.\n  - **Body**: \n    - Snake body segments: (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2).\n    - (5,2) is already occupied by the snake's body (third segment).\n    - **Collision**: Moving here would make the head hit the body.\n- **Conclusion**: Deadly move, avoid.\n\n### Evaluating Best Move\n\nFrom the above:\n- Left (L): Safe, no food.\n- Up (U): Safe, eats positive food.\n- Down (D): Deadly.\n\nBetween L and U, U is better because it allows eating the positive food, increasing the score and length.\n\n### Verifying Food Mechanics\n\nThe food at (5,4):\n- It's positive (+1).\n- Life span is 9, countdown decreases every turn (including current turn 12). So it will disappear after turn 20.\n- Since we're at turn 12, it's safe to eat now.\n- No special cases apply (not under body, no tail reward danger).\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe best immediate action is to move Up (U) to eat the positive food at (5,4).\n\n\\boxed{U}",

The possible moves are Up, Left, or Right (cannot move Down as it's the opposite of current direction).\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n1. **Up (U)**: From (5,4) to (5,5)\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: (5,5) is not a wall (y=5 is not a border, and no internal wall at (5,5)).\n     - Body: Snake body is at (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2). (5,5) is not in these.\n   - Safe to move.\n   - After moving, the new head is at (5,5), tail moves away from (3,2), so new body is [(5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2)].\n   - No food at (5,5), so no score change.\n\n2. **Left (L)**: From (5,4) to (4,4)\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: (4,4) is not a wall.\n     - Body: (4,4) is not in body segments.\n   - Safe to move.\n   - After moving, new head at (4,4), body is [(4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2)].\n   - No food at (4,4), no score change.\n\n3. **Right (R)**: From (5,4) to (6,4)\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: (6,4) is not a wall.\n     - Body: (6,4) is not in body segments.\n   - Safe to move.\n   - After moving, new head at (6,4), body is [(6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2)].\n   - No food at (6,4), no score change.\n\n### Evaluating Food\n\nThe only food is at (3,5), which is positive (value=1). Currently, the head is at (5,4). \n\nDistance to food:\n- Manhattan distance from (5,4) to (3,5) is |5-3| + |4-5| = 2 + 1 = 3.\n\nPossible paths to reach the food:\n- One possible path: Left to (4,4), then Left to (3,4), then Up to (3,5).\n  - But need to ensure that moving Left twice is possible (no instant reverse after first Left).\n\nAlternatively:\n- Up to (5,5), then Left to (4,5), then Left to (3,5).\n  - But (4,5) is safe (no walls or body), (3,5) is food.\n\nHowever, since we're only deciding the immediate next move, we should choose a move that starts moving towards the food if possible.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Food Access\n\nCan we reach the food in one move? Current head is at (5,4), food at (3,5). Not adjacent (distance is 3), so no.\n\n### Choosing the Best Immediate Move\n\nAll three possible moves (U, L, R) are safe. We should choose the one that moves us closer to the food.\n\n- Up (U) to (5,5): Distance to food becomes |5-3| + |5-5| = 2.\n- Left (L) to (4,4): Distance to food becomes |4-3| + |4-5| = 1 + 1 = 2.\n- Right (R) to (6,4): Distance to food becomes |6-3| + |4-5| = 3 + 1 = 4.\n\nLeft and Up both reduce the distance equally. Between these, Left seems better because:\n- After Left to (4,4), next move could be Left to (3,4) (distance to food 1), then Up to (3,5).\n- After Up to (5,5), next move could be Left to (4,5), then Left to (3,5).\n\nBoth sequences take two more moves after the first, but Left first may be slightly more direct.\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nWe also need to ensure that moving Left doesn't put us in a position where the tail has positive food that could kill us next turn. Currently, the tail is at (3,2). There's no food there, so no danger.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter evaluating all options, moving **Left (L)** seems like the best immediate action to start moving towards the food while being safe.\n\n\\boxed{L}",

Here's a rough sketch focusing on the snake and food:\n\n```\ny=7: -----------------\n...\ny=5: |   |   | F |   | ... (F at (3,5))\ny=4: |   | H | B |   | ... (H at (4,4), B at (5,4))\ny=3: |   |   | B |   | ... (B at (5,3), (6,3))\ny=2: |   | B | B | T | ... (B at (6,2), (5,2), T at (4,2))\ny=1: |   |   |   |   | ...\ny=0: -----------------\n     x=0 x=1 x=2 x=3 x=4 x=5 x=6 x=7\n```\n\n(Note: This is a simplified representation; internal obstacles are not shown here for clarity.)\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nThe snake is currently moving Left (L). The possible moves are:\n- **Left (L)**: (x-1,y) → (3,4)\n- **Up (U)**: (x,y+1) → (4,5)\n- **Down (D)**: (x,y-1) → (4,3)\n\nCannot move Right (R) because that's the opposite of the current direction (L), which is not allowed.\n\n#### Checking Each Move:\n\n1. **Left (L) to (3,4)**:\n   - Check for walls: (3,4) is not a border wall or internal obstacle.\n   - Check for body collision:\n     - Snake body segments: (5,4), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2)\n     - (3,4) is not in the body, so safe.\n   - Food: No food at (3,4).\n   - **Safe move**, but doesn't eat food.\n\n2. **Up (U) to (4,5)**:\n   - Check walls: (4,5) is not a wall.\n   - Body collision: (4,5) is not in the body.\n   - Food: Food is at (3,5), not (4,5).\n   - **Safe move**, but doesn't eat food.\n\n3. **Down (D) to (4,3)**:\n   - Check walls: (4,3) is not a wall.\n   - Body collision:\n     - Body segments: (5,4), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2)\n     - (5,3) and (6,3) are at y=3, but x is different.\n     - (4,3) is not in the body.\n   - Food: No food at (4,3).\n   - **Safe move**, but doesn't eat food.\n\n### Evaluating Food Consumption\n\nThe only food is at (3,5) with value=1 (positive). To eat it:\n- Need to move the head to (3,5).\n- Current head is at (4,4). Possible paths:\n  - From (4,4), can go Left to (3,4), then Up to (3,5).\n  - Or Up to (4,5), then Left to (3,5).\n\nBut we can only decide the immediate next move at t=14.\n\nIs there a way to head towards the food now?\n\n- Moving Up to (4,5) gets us closer to the food's y-coordinate.\n- Then next turn, could move Left to (3,5) to eat the food.\n\nBut we must ensure that moving Up now doesn't lead to a dead end or collision later.\n\n### Checking Tail Reward Danger\n\nThe food is at (3,5), which is not adjacent to the tail (tail is at (4,2)), so no immediate danger from tail reward.\n\n### Obstacles and Path Safety\n\nLet's see if moving Up leads to any immediate dangers:\n- After moving to (4,5), next possible moves:\n  - Left to (3,5) to eat food.\n  - Right to (5,5) - but (5,5) is safe (no body or walls).\n  - Up to (4,6) - but (4,6) is an internal obstacle (from the list). So cannot go Up next.\n  - Down to (4,4) - but (4,4) is where the head was, now occupied by the neck (5,4) after moving up, so it's part of the body. Would collide if we go down next.\n\nSo if we go Up now, next turn must go Left to eat food or Right to avoid collision.\n\nGoing Left now to (3,4) is safe but doesn't progress towards food.\n\nGoing Down to (4,3):\n- Then next moves could be Left to (3,3) or Right to (5,3) (but (5,3) is body), or Down to (4,2) (tail), which is safe because tail moves.\n- But this seems to move away from food.\n\n### Decision\n\nThe food is at (3,5), and moving Up to (4,5) is a step towards it without immediate danger. Next turn, can move Left to eat the food.\n\nOther moves don't help in reaching the food soon.\n\n### Verifying No Better Immediate Food Consumption\n\nIs there any food under the snake's body that can be eaten now?\n- Food is only at (3,5), which is not under the snake's body.\n- So no immediate food to eat by moving away.\n\n### Final Choice\n\nAt t=14, the best immediate action is to move Up to position (4,5), setting up to eat the food at (3,5) next turn if possible.\n\n\\boxed{U}",

So, the snake cannot move outside these boundaries.\n   - **Internal Obstacles**: There are five internal walls at (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6).\n3. **Snake**:\n   - **Positions**: The snake's body is represented as a list from head to tail: [(4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2)].\n   - **Direction**: The head is currently moving \"Up\" (U).\n4. **Food**:\n   - Only one food item is present at (3,5) with a value of 1 (positive food) and a life span of 8 turns.\n\n### Visualizing the Snake and Food\n\nTo better understand, I'll visualize the snake and food positions:\n\n- **Head**: (4,5)\n- **Body**: (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2)\n- **Food**: (3,5)\n\n### Possible Actions and Constraints\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However, there are constraints:\n\n1. **No Instant Reverse**: Since the current direction is U, the snake cannot move D in the next turn.\n2. **Collision Avoidance**:\n   - **Body Collision**: The snake cannot move into any part of its body except the tail, because the tail moves forward.\n   - **Wall Collision**: The snake cannot move into any wall or obstacle.\n\n### Evaluating Possible Moves\n\nGiven the head is at (4,5) and direction is U, let's evaluate the possible moves:\n\n1. **Up (U)**: Move to (4,6)\n   - Check for walls: (4,6) is an internal obstacle → **Invalid**.\n2. **Down (D)**: Move to (4,4)\n   - Check for reverse: Current direction is U → D is reverse → **Invalid**.\n3. **Left (L)**: Move to (3,5)\n   - Check for walls: No wall at (3,5).\n   - Check for body collision: (3,5) is not in the snake's body.\n   - Check for food: (3,5) has food → **Valid**.\n4. **Right (R)**: Move to (5,5)\n   - Check for walls: No wall at (5,5).\n   - Check for body collision: (5,5) is not in the snake's body → **Valid**.\n\n### Considering Food Consumption\n\nThe food at (3,5) is positive (value=1). Moving L would allow the snake to eat it. However, we need to consider the implications:\n\n1. **Eating the Food**:\n   - **Reward**: +1 score, length increases by 1.\n   - **New Tail Position**: The tail remains at (5,2) because the snake grows by adding a new head position but the tail doesn't move.\n\nBut, we must check for **Tail Reward Danger**:\n   - **Condition**: If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food.\n   - **Current State**: Tail is at (5,2). Head is at (4,5). The distance between (4,5) and (5,2) is not adjacent (they are more than one cell apart).\n   - **Conclusion**: No danger here.\n\n### Comparing L and R\n\nBoth L and R are valid moves. But L leads to food, which is beneficial. However, we should also consider the future implications:\n\n1. **Moving Left (L)**:\n   - New head at (3,5).\n   - New body: [(3,5), (4,5), (4,4), ...].\n   - Food is eaten → snake length increases to 8.\n\n2. **Moving Right (R)**:\n   - New head at (5,5).\n   - New body: [(5,5), (4,5), (4,4), ...].\n   - No food eaten → snake length remains 7.\n\n### Potential Future Moves After L\n\nAfter moving L:\n- Next turn, head is at (3,5).\n- Possible moves: U, D, L, R (but need to avoid reverse, which would be R).\n- U: (3,6) → Check walls: y=6 is not a wall, but need to check internal obstacles. (3,6) is not listed → Valid.\n- D: (3,4) → Not reverse → Valid.\n- L: (2,5) → Not reverse → Valid.\n- R: (4,5) → Reverse of L → Invalid.\n\n### Potential Future Moves After R\n\nAfter moving R:\n- Next turn, head is at (5,5).\n- Possible moves: U, D, L, R (avoid reverse, which is L).\n- U: (5,6) → Check walls: (5,6) is not listed → Valid.\n- D: (5,4) → Not reverse → But (5,4) is part of the body → Invalid.\n- L: (4,5) → Reverse of R → Invalid.\n- R: (6,5) → Not reverse → Valid.\n\n### Decision Making\n\n- **Left (L)**:\n  - Immediate reward: +1 score.\n  - Future options: U, D, L.\n  - Risk: None identified.\n\n- **Right (R)**:\n  - No immediate reward.\n  - Future options: U, R.\n  - Risk: Limited options next turn.\n\nGiven that L provides an immediate reward and doesn't pose any immediate danger, it's the better choice.\n\n### Verifying Tail Reward Danger Again\n\nJust to be sure, let's re-examine the Tail Reward Danger condition:\n- **Head**: (4,5)\n- **Tail**: (5,2)\n- **Adjacent**: For (4,5) and (5,2), the Manhattan distance is |4-5| + |5-2| = 1 + 3 = 4, which is greater than 1 → Not adjacent.\n- **Food at Tail**: There's no food at (5,2) → No danger.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter careful consideration, moving Left (L) is the optimal choice because:\n1. It allows the snake to eat positive food.\n2. It doesn't lead to any immediate collision or danger.\n3. It provides more flexibility for future moves compared to moving Right.\n\n\\boxed{L}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The grid is 8x8 (from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7).\n2. **Walls**:\n   - Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.\n   - Internal obstacles: (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6).\n3. **Snake**:\n   - Positions (head first): [(3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2)].\n   - Current head direction: Left (L).\n4. **Food**:\n   - Only one food item: (6, 3) with value = 1 and life_span = 10.\n\n### Snake's Current Position and Direction\n\n- **Head**: (3,5), moving Left (L).\n- **Body Segments**: \n  - Next segment: (4,5), then (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2).\n  \nFrom the head's current position (3,5), moving Left would take it to (2,5). \n\n### Possible Moves\n\nGiven the current direction is Left (L), the possible moves are:\n- Continue Left (L): (2,5)\n- Turn Up (U): (3,6)\n- Turn Down (D): (3,4)\n  \nCannot move Right (R) because that's the opposite of Left, which is not allowed (no instant reverse).\n\n### Checking Each Possible Move\n\n1. **Move Left (L) to (2,5)**:\n   - Check for walls: \n     - x=2 is not a border wall (borders are x=0,7).\n     - Internal obstacles: (1,2), (1,5), (2,6) — (2,5) is not an obstacle.\n   - Check for body collision:\n     - Snake body segments: (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2).\n     - (2,5) is not in the body segments.\n   - Food at (6,3): Not at (2,5), so no food eaten.\n   - Safe move.\n\n2. **Move Up (U) to (3,6)**:\n   - Check walls:\n     - y=6: Not a border wall (borders are y=0,7).\n     - Internal obstacles: (4,6) — (3,6) is not an obstacle.\n   - Body collision:\n     - (3,6) not in body segments.\n   - Food: Not at (3,6).\n   - Safe move.\n\n3. **Move Down (D) to (3,4)**:\n   - Check walls:\n     - y=4: Not a border wall.\n     - Internal obstacles: (4,1) — (3,4) is not an obstacle.\n   - Body collision:\n     - Body segments: (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2).\n     - (3,4) is not in the body.\n   - Food: Not at (3,4).\n   - Safe move.\n\n### Considering the Food\n\nThere's food at (6,3):\n- Current value: 1 (positive).\n- Life span: 10 (so it will disappear after 10 more turns, including this one).\n- The food is at (6,3), which is currently occupied by the snake's body (specifically, the 6th segment counting from the head: (6,3)).\n\n**Special Case for Food Under Body**:\n- To eat food under the body:\n  1. The body must move away from the food cell.\n  2. Then, the head must move onto the food cell.\n\nCurrently, (6,3) is occupied by the snake's body. The tail is at (5,2). \n\nTo eat the food at (6,3):\n- The body must first move away from (6,3), meaning the tail must move forward, which would free up (6,3) in future moves.\n- Then, the head would need to navigate to (6,3) to eat it.\n\nHowever, currently, the head is at (3,5), and the food is at (6,3). That's a distance of |3-6| + |5-3| = 3 + 2 = 5 cells away. It would take several moves to reach there, and by then, the food might disappear (life span is 10, but we're at turn 16, and it's unclear when it spawned; assuming it's been there for a few turns already, it might not last long enough).\n\n**Tail Reward Danger**:\n- If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n- Currently, the tail is at (5,2), and the head is at (3,5). Distance is |3-5| + |5-2| = 2 + 3 = 5, not adjacent (adjacent means distance of 1). So this isn't a concern now.\n\n### Deciding the Best Move\n\nAll three possible moves (L, U, D) are safe in terms of not hitting walls or the body. None of them immediately lead to food. \n\nGiven that the food is at (6,3) and the head is at (3,5), moving towards the food would generally be beneficial, but we need to consider the path:\n\nFrom (3,5):\n- To reach (6,3), we'd need to move right and down.\n- Current direction is Left, so moving Right is not allowed (opposite direction).\n- So immediate options are Up or Down to change direction.\n\nMoving Down to (3,4) seems better because:\n- From (3,4), next move could be Right to (4,4), then down to (4,3), etc., getting closer to (6,3).\n- Moving Up to (3,6) takes us further from the food.\n\nMoving Left to (2,5) is safe but doesn't help in getting closer to the food.\n\n**Potential Path to Food**:\n1. Current: (3,5) - L\n2. Move D: (3,4) - now can move R\n3. Move R: (4,4) - then D\n4. Move D: (4,3) - then R\n5. Move R: (5,3) - then D\n6. Move D: (5,2) - then R\n7. Move R: (6,2) - then U\n8. Move U: (6,3) - eat food\n\nBut this is many moves, and the food might disappear by then. \n\nAlternatively, maybe another path is shorter, but given the obstacles, it's complex.\n\nGiven that, and since all immediate moves are safe, moving Down seems slightly better to start maneuvering towards the food, even if we might not reach it in time.\n\n### Checking Immediate Safety Again\n\nLet me double-check moving Down to (3,4):\n- Next segment is (4,5), then (4,4), etc.\n- (3,4) is not in the body.\n- No walls at (3,4).\n- Safe.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nSince moving Down is safe and starts a potential path towards the food, and the other safe moves don't offer immediate benefits, I'll choose Down.\n\n\\boxed{D}",

The possible moves are U, D, L, R, but we must consider:\n- **No instant reverse**: Since the current direction is D, we cannot move U next.\n- So, possible moves: D, L, R.\n\nLet's evaluate each:\n\n#### 1. Move Down (D):\n   - New head position: (3,4) + D = (3,3).\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: y=0 is at y=0, so y=3 is safe. x=3 is not a wall.\n     - Internal obstacles: (3,3) is not in the list [(4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6)].\n     - Body collision: Check if (3,3) is in snake positions.\n       - Snake positions: [(3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2)].\n       - (3,3) is not in the list.\n   - Safe move.\n   - Food at (6,3): Not eating any food here.\n   - New tail: The tail is at (6,2), which moves to (6,3) (since the head moves to (3,3), the segment at (6,2) is the tail and will move forward).\n     - But (6,3) is where the food is. However, since the head is not moving to (6,3), this doesn't affect eating the food.\n\n#### 2. Move Left (L):\n   - New head position: (3,4) + L = (2,4).\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: x=0 is at x=0, so x=2 is safe. y=4 is not a wall.\n     - Internal obstacles: (2,4) is not in the list.\n     - Body collision: (2,4) is not in snake positions.\n   - Safe move.\n   - Not eating any food.\n   - Tail moves similarly as above.\n\n#### 3. Move Right (R):\n   - New head position: (3,4) + R = (4,4).\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: x=7 is at x=7, so x=4 is safe. y=4 is not a wall.\n     - Internal obstacles: (4,4) is not in the list.\n     - Body collision: (4,4) is in snake positions (4th segment).\n       - But is this a collision? Normally, moving into a body segment is deadly unless it's the tail.\n       - The tail is at (6,2), which will move to (6,3) next, so (4,4) is not the tail.\n       - Therefore, moving into (4,4) would collide with the body.\n   - **Deadly move**: Collision with body at (4,4).\n\nSo, R is not safe. Only D and L are safe.\n\n### Considering the Food\n\nThere's positive food at (6,3) with life span 1 (will disappear after this turn if not eaten).\n\nCan we eat it this turn?\n- Current head is at (3,4). To reach (6,3) in one move is impossible (would require moving 3 right and 1 down in one step, but moves are only one cell).\n- So, cannot eat the food this turn directly.\n\nHowever, the food is at (6,3), which is currently occupied by the snake's body (7th segment: (6,3)).\n- According to the rules, food under the body can only be eaten if:\n  1. The body moves away, and\n  2. The head moves onto the food cell.\n- Currently, the segment at (6,3) is not the tail (tail is at (6,2)), so moving the snake will cause the segment at (6,3) to move to (6,2) (as the tail moves forward), thus the food at (6,3) will be uncovered.\n- But the head cannot reach (6,3) in one move from (3,4), so we cannot eat it this turn.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger\n\nThere's a rule about \"Tail Reward Danger\":\n- If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n- Current tail is at (6,2).\n- Adjacent cells to tail: (5,2), (7,2), (6,1), (6,3).\n- Head is at (3,4), which is not adjacent to (6,2), so no danger here.\n\n### Best Move\n\nSince we cannot eat the food this turn, and both D and L are safe, we should choose the move that potentially positions us better for future moves.\n\nLooking at the grid:\n- Moving D to (3,3):\n  - Next moves could be L to (2,3), R to (4,3), or D to (3,2).\n- Moving L to (2,4):\n  - Next moves could be D to (2,3), L to (1,4), or R to (3,4) (but R would be reverse from L, which is not allowed unless we're not in L direction yet).\n\nGiven that the food is at (6,3), which is to the right and down from the head, moving D might be better to start heading towards that direction, but it's not immediately helpful.\n\nAlternatively, moving L might open up more space, but it's moving away from the food.\n\nSince the food will disappear after this turn, and we can't reach it, the choice between D and L doesn't affect the food. Both are safe, so either is fine. \n\nBut moving D keeps us moving downward, which might be more consistent with the current direction.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter considering all options, the safe moves are D and L. Since moving D maintains the current direction and is safe, I'll choose D.\n\n\\boxed{D}",

(2,3) is not an obstacle.\n   - Check body collision: (2,3) is not in the body segments.\n   - Safe move.\n\n3. **Right (R) to (4,3)**:\n   - Check walls: x=7 is a wall, but (4,3) is not a wall.\n   - Check obstacles: (4,3) is not listed as an obstacle.\n   - Check body collision: (4,3) is not in the body segments.\n   - Safe move.\n\nAll three possible moves are safe in terms of not hitting walls or the body.\n\n### Considering Food\n\nThe food is at (6,3), which is currently under the snake's tail. \n\n**Special Case for Eating Food Under Body**:\n- The food can only be eaten if:\n  1. The body moves away (tail moves from (6,3)), and\n  2. The head moves onto the food cell (head moves to (6,3)).\n\nCurrently, the head is at (3,3), and the tail is at (6,3). To eat this food:\n- The head would need to move towards (6,3), and the tail would move away in the next turn.\n- However, the head is quite far from the food, and moving towards it would take several turns, during which the food's lifespan may expire (current lifespan=8, turn=18).\n\nGiven that, it's unlikely we can reach the food in time to eat it, especially since the snake is long (length=8), making movement slow.\n\nMoreover, even if we could reach it, there's a **Tail Reward Danger**:\n- If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n- Currently, the head is not adjacent to the tail (distance is more than 1), but if we move towards the tail, this could become a risk.\n\nGiven these factors, trying to eat the food at (6,3) seems risky and impractical. It's better to ignore this food for now.\n\n### Evaluating Moves Without Food Consideration\n\nSince the food is not a viable target, we should choose a move that:\n1. Keeps the snake safe (no collisions).\n2. Maximizes future options (avoids getting trapped).\n\nPossible moves: D, L, R.\n\nLet's see where each move leads:\n\n1. **Down (D) to (3,2)**:\n   - Next possible moves from (3,2): Cannot go Up (reverse of D), so can go D, L, R.\n   - D: (3,1) - safe (not wall or body).\n   - L: (2,2) - safe.\n   - R: (4,2) - safe.\n   - Seems to open up space.\n\n2. **Left (L) to (2,3)**:\n   - Next possible moves from (2,3): Cannot go R (reverse of L), so can go U, D, L.\n   - U: (2,4) - check body: (3,4) is body, but (2,4) is safe.\n   - D: (2,2) - safe.\n   - L: (1,3) - check walls/obstacles: x=0 is wall, but (1,3) is not a wall or obstacle.\n   - Also opens up space.\n\n3. **Right (R) to (4,3)**:\n   - Next possible moves from (4,3): Cannot go L (reverse of R), so can go U, D, R.\n   - U: (4,4) - body segment at (4,4) - collision! So cannot go U next.\n   - D: (4,2) - safe.\n   - R: (5,3) - body segment at (5,3) - collision! So cannot go R next.\n   - So only D is possible next move, which limits options.\n\nThus, moving Right (R) to (4,3) limits future moves significantly, as the next turn would only allow moving Down (D). This could lead to getting trapped.\n\nBetween Down (D) and Left (L), both seem safe and keep options open. \n\nLooking at the snake's body:\n- Moving Down (D) to (3,2) moves away from the body segments above (3,4), (3,5).\n- Moving Left (L) to (2,3) moves towards the left side where there's more open space (no immediate obstacles).\n\nGiven that the snake is currently near the right side (head at x=3, body extends to x=6), moving Left might be better to explore more open areas where new food could spawn.\n\n### Potential Future Food Spawns\n\nAlthough not given, moving towards less crowded areas increases chances of encountering new food. The left side (x=0 to x=3) seems less occupied by the snake's body compared to the right.\n\n### Decision\n\nBetween Down (D) and Left (L), both are safe, but Left seems slightly better for exploring open space. Right (R) is too restrictive for future moves.\n\n### Verifying Tail Movement\n\nAfter moving Left to (2,3), the tail (6,3) will move forward, meaning the segment before it (5,3) becomes the new tail. The food at (6,3) will no longer be under the snake after this move, but as discussed, it's not reachable in time.\n\n### Final Choice\n\nAfter considering all factors, the best immediate action is to move **Left (L)**.\n\n\\boxed{L}",

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State\n\nFirst, let's break down the current state to visualize the scenario:\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The game is played on an 8x8 grid (from (0,0) to (7,7)), with walls at the borders (x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7) and some internal obstacles at specific coordinates.\n\n2. **Snake Position and Direction**:\n   - **Head**: At (2, 3), moving Left (L).\n   - **Body Segments**: [(3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5), (4, 4), (5, 4), (5, 3)].\n   - **Length**: 8 segments (including the head).\n\n3. **Food Items**:\n   - **First Food**: At (6, 3), value = +1, life_span = 7.\n   - **Second Food**: At (4, 4), value = +1, life_span = 10.\n     - Note: (4,4) is currently occupied by the snake's body (6th segment from the head).\n\n4. **Current Direction**: The snake is moving Left (L), so the previous move was from (3,3) to (2,3). The opposite direction is Right (R), which is not allowed in the next move to prevent instant reversal.\n\n### Possible Moves from Current Position (2,3)\n\nGiven the current direction is Left (L), the possible moves without instant reversal are:\n\n- **Left (L)**: (1, 3)\n- **Up (U)**: (2, 4)\n- **Down (D)**: (2, 2)\n\nRight (R) is opposite to Left, so it's not allowed.\n\n### Evaluating Each Possible Move\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move for safety (no collisions) and potential to eat food.\n\n#### 1. Move Left (L) to (1, 3)\n\n- **Check for Collisions**:\n  - **Walls**: x=0 is a wall, but (1,3) is not a wall.\n  - **Body**: Check if (1,3) is in the snake's body segments.\n    - Current body segments: (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3).\n    - (1,3) is not in the body, so safe.\n  \n- **Food Availability**:\n  - No food at (1,3).\n  \n- **Conclusion**: Safe move, but no immediate reward.\n\n#### 2. Move Up (U) to (2, 4)\n\n- **Check for Collisions**:\n  - **Walls**: y=7 is the upper wall, (2,4) is not a wall.\n  - **Body**: Check if (2,4) is in the body.\n    - Not present in current body segments.\n  \n- **Food Availability**:\n  - No food at (2,4).\n  \n- **Conclusion**: Safe move, no immediate reward.\n\n#### 3. Move Down (D) to (2, 2)\n\n- **Check for Collisions**:\n  - **Walls**: y=0 is the lower wall, (2,2) is not a wall.\n  - **Body**: Check if (2,2) is in the body.\n    - Not present in current body segments.\n  \n- **Food Availability**:\n  - No food at (2,2).\n  \n- **Conclusion**: Safe move, no immediate reward.\n\n### Considering Food Items\n\nNow, let's look at the food items:\n\n1. **Food at (6, 3)**:\n   - Value: +1\n   - Life_span: 7\n   - Distance from head (2,3): |6-2| + |3-3| = 4 (Manhattan distance).\n   - To reach it, the snake would need to move Right (opposite current direction, not allowed), then possibly Up/Down to navigate around obstacles.\n   - Not immediately accessible in the next move.\n\n2. **Food at (4, 4)**:\n   - Value: +1\n   - Life_span: 10\n   - Currently under the snake's body at (4,4).\n   - To eat this:\n     - The body must move away from (4,4), and then the head must move onto it.\n     - Currently, the segment at (4,4) is the 6th segment from the head.\n     - The tail is at (5,3), which will move to (5,4) if the head moves away, but this doesn't immediately free up (4,4).\n     - It's not possible to eat this food in the next move because the head cannot reach (4,4) from (2,3) in one move, and the body isn't moving away in a way that would free (4,4) immediately.\n\n### Special Consideration: Tail Reward Danger\n\nThe \"Tail Reward Danger\" rule states that if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\n- Current tail position: (5,3).\n- Adjacent to head (2,3)? \n  - Distance: |5-2| + |3-3| = 3 (not adjacent; adjacent means distance of 1).\n- So, no immediate danger from this rule.\n\n### Potential Future Moves\n\nSince none of the immediate moves lead to food, we should choose a move that keeps the snake safe and possibly positions it to reach food in future turns.\n\n- Moving Left (L) to (1,3):\n  - Next possible moves from (1,3): L (to (0,3) - wall, so invalid), U (to (1,4)), D (to (1,2)).\n  - Internal obstacle at (1,2) and (1,5), but (1,4) is clear.\n  \n- Moving Up (U) to (2,4):\n  - Next possible moves: L (to (1,4)), R (to (3,4)), U (to (2,5)), D (to (2,3)).\n  - (3,4) is in the body, so R is unsafe unless the body moves.\n  - (2,3) is the previous head position, now occupied by the neck, so D is unsafe.\n  \n- Moving Down (D) to (2,2):\n  - Next possible moves: L (to (1,2) - obstacle), R (to (3,2)), U (to (2,3)), D (to (2,1)).\n  - (1,2) is an obstacle, so L is invalid.\n  - (2,3) is the neck, so U is unsafe.\n  \nGiven these, moving Left seems safer as it doesn't immediately box the snake in, whereas Up and Down have more restricted next moves.\n\n### Decision\n\nGiven that all immediate moves are safe but none lead to food, and considering future mobility:\n\n- **Left (L)**: Leads to (1,3), from where the snake can move Up to (1,4) next, keeping options open.\n- **Up (U)**: Leads to (2,4), with limited next moves (only Left to (1,4) is safe).\n- **Down (D)**: Leads to (2,2), with limited next moves (only Right to (3,2) is safe).\n\nMoving Left seems the most flexible option to maintain maneuverability.\n\nHowever, looking at the snake's body, moving Left takes the head to (1,3), and the tail is at (5,3). The body will shift, making (3,3) the new neck, and so on. \n\nBut let's check if moving Left could lead to a dead end:\n\nFrom (1,3):\n- Next move Up to (1,4):\n  - Then possible moves: L (to (0,4) - wall), R (to (2,4)), U (to (1,5) - obstacle), D (to (1,3) - neck).\n  - Only R to (2,4) is safe, but then from (2,4), options are limited.\n\nAlternatively, from (1,3), move Down to (1,2) - but that's an obstacle.\n\nSo moving Left might lead to a corner. \n\nMoving Up to (2,4):\n- Next move Left to (1,4):\n  - Then can move Up/Down if possible, but (1,5) is obstacle, so only Down to (1,3), but that's the previous position.\n\nThis also seems restrictive.\n\nMoving Down to (2,2):\n- Next move Right to (3,2):\n  - Then can move U (to (3,3) - body), D (to (3,1)), L (to (2,2) - neck), R (to (4,2)).\n  - Only D or R are safe.\n  \nThis seems slightly better than the other options.\n\nGiven that, moving Down might be the better choice to avoid getting boxed in immediately.\n\n### Re-evaluating Immediate Safety\n\nWait, let's confirm that moving Down to (2,2) is safe:\n\n- (2,2) is not a wall (y=0 is at y=0, not y=2).\n- (2,2) is not in the current body segments: [(3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3)].\n- No obstacles at (2,2).\n\nSo it is safe.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter considering all options, moving Down seems to offer slightly better future mobility compared to Left or Up, which might lead to quicker confinement.\n\nTherefore, the best immediate action is:\n\n\\boxed{D}",

(6,3): value = 6, life_span = 1\n   - Positive food (+1 score, increases length by 1)\n   - Will disappear after this turn (since life_span decreases this turn to 0)\n2. (4,4): value = 9, life_span = 1\n   - Positive food (+1 score, increases length by 1)\n   - Will disappear after this turn\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (2,2) moving Down (D), the possible next moves are:\n- **Up (U)**: (2,3) \n  - But this is the opposite of current direction (D), which is not allowed (no instant reverse).\n- **Down (D)**: (2,1)\n- **Left (L)**: (1,2)\n- **Right (R)**: (3,2)\n\nSo, possible actions: D, L, R.\n\n### Evaluating Each Possible Move\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move for safety (no collisions) and potential to eat food.\n\n#### 1. Move Down (D) to (2,1)\n- Check for walls: \n  - y=0 is a wall, (2,1) is y=1, so not a wall.\n- Check for body collisions:\n  - Snake body positions: (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4)\n  - (2,1) is not in this list → safe.\n- Food at (2,1)? No food listed there.\n- Conclusion: Safe move, no food.\n\n#### 2. Move Left (L) to (1,2)\n- Check for walls:\n  - Internal obstacles: (1,2) is an internal wall → cannot move here.\n- Conclusion: Invalid move (wall collision).\n\n#### 3. Move Right (R) to (3,2)\n- Check for walls:\n  - No walls at (3,2).\n- Check for body collisions:\n  - (3,2) is not in the body list → safe.\n- Food at (3,2)? No food listed there.\n- Conclusion: Safe move, no food.\n\n### Considering Food\n\nNow, let's see if any food is reachable or poses a danger.\n\n**Food at (6,3)**:\n- Distance from head (2,2): \n  - Manhattan distance: |6-2| + |3-2| = 4 + 1 = 5\n  - Cannot reach in one move.\n  \n**Food at (4,4)**:\n- Currently under the snake's body (part of the body at (4,4)).\n- To eat it:\n  - Body must move away, then head moves onto it.\n  - Currently, the body segment at (4,4) is part of the snake.\n  - The tail is at (5,4), next is (4,4), which is the 7th segment (from head: 0-head, 1-(2,3), ..., 7-(4,4)).\n  - If the snake moves such that (4,4) is no longer occupied by the body, then next turn head can move to (4,4).\n  - But the food disappears after this turn (life_span=1), so cannot eat it next turn.\n  - Hence, cannot eat (4,4) this turn.\n\n**Tail Reward Danger**:\n- Is the head adjacent to the tail, and tail has positive food?\n  - Tail is at (5,4).\n  - Head is at (2,2). Distance: |5-2| + |4-2| = 3 + 2 = 5 → not adjacent.\n  - So no danger here.\n\n### Best Move Options\n\nFrom the possible moves:\n- Down (D): (2,1) - safe, no food.\n- Right (R): (3,2) - safe, no food.\nLeft is invalid.\n\nBoth D and R are safe but don't lead to food. Since both foods will disappear after this turn, we can't reach them in time.\n\nBetween D and R:\n- Current direction is D, so moving D maintains direction.\n- Moving R changes direction to right.\n\nIn Snake, sometimes maintaining direction is safer unless there's a reason to turn. Here, both options seem equally safe in terms of immediate collision.\n\nLooking ahead slightly:\n- After D to (2,1), next moves could be L to (1,1) or R to (3,1) or D to (2,0) (wall).\n- After R to (3,2), next moves could be U to (3,3) (body at (3,3) - collision), D to (3,1), or R to (4,2).\n\nMoving D seems slightly better because:\n- After R to (3,2), next move U is into body, D is okay, R is okay.\n- After D to (2,1), next move L is (1,1) (no wall), R is (3,1), D is wall.\n\nBoth have similar future options, but moving D keeps the snake moving downward, which might be slightly better for future flexibility.\n\nHowever, looking at the snake's body, moving R to (3,2) might open up more space in the future compared to moving D into the lower part where walls are closer.\n\nGiven that, both are equally safe, but perhaps moving R is slightly better to explore more space.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nBoth moves are safe, and neither reaches food this turn. Moving Right might offer slightly better future movement options.\n\n\\boxed{R}",

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Problem\n\nFirst, I need to understand the current state of the Snake game based on the provided information. Here's what I gather:\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The game is played on an 8x8 grid (since x and y range from 0 to 7).\n2. **Walls**:\n   - **Border Walls**: The perimeter of the grid (x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7) is walls.\n   - **Internal Obstacles**: There are five internal walls at positions (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), and (2,6).\n3. **Snake**:\n   - **Positions**: The snake's body segments are at [(3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4)]. The head is at (3,2), and the tail is at (4,4).\n   - **Direction**: The snake's head is currently moving to the Right (R).\n4. **Food**:\n   - Two pieces of food:\n     - (6,3): value = +1, life_span = 5 turns remaining.\n     - (4,4): value = +1, life_span = 8 turns remaining.\n\n### Visualizing the Snake and Food\n\nTo better understand, I'll sketch a simplified version of the grid:\n\n```\ny=7 ---------------------\n... |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\ny=6 |   |   | X |   | X |   |   |   |\ny=5 |   | X |   |   |   |   |   |   |\ny=4 |   |   |   | S | S | S |   |   |\ny=3 |   | X | S | S |   |   | F |   |\ny=2 |   |   | H | S |   |   |   |   |\ny=1 |   | X |   |   | X |   |   |   |\ny=0 ---------------------\n     x=0 x=1 x=2 x=3 x=4 x=5 x=6 x=7\n```\n\n- `H`: Snake head at (3,2)\n- `S`: Snake body segments\n- `F`: Food at (6,3)\n- `X`: Internal walls\n\nThe other food is at (4,4), which is currently occupied by the snake's tail.\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However:\n\n1. **Current Direction**: The snake is moving Right (R), so the immediate opposite direction is Left (L), which is not allowed (no instant reverse).\n   - Thus, cannot move Left.\n\nSo, possible moves: U, D, R.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each possible move:\n\n#### 1. Move Right (R) to (4,2)\n\n- **New Head Position**: (4,2)\n- **Check for Collisions**:\n  - **Walls**: x=7 is a wall, but (4,2) is not a wall.\n  - **Body**: Check if (4,2) is in the snake's body segments.\n    - Current body: [(2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4)]\n    - (4,2) is not in the body.\n- **Food**: \n  - No food at (4,2).\n- **Outcome**: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n#### 2. Move Up (U) to (3,3)\n\n- **New Head Position**: (3,3)\n- **Check for Collisions**:\n  - **Walls**: (3,3) is not a wall.\n  - **Body**: (3,3) is the 4th segment of the snake [(3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), ...].\n    - Moving to (3,3) would mean the head collides with the body.\n- **Outcome**: Collision with body → Death. Invalid move.\n\n#### 3. Move Down (D) to (3,1)\n\n- **New Head Position**: (3,1)\n- **Check for Collisions**:\n  - **Walls**: \n    - Internal walls include (4,1), but (3,1) is not listed as a wall.\n    - Border walls: y=0 is a wall, but (3,1) is y=1, so safe.\n  - **Body**: Check if (3,1) is in the snake's body.\n    - Current body: [(2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4)]\n    - (3,1) is not in the body.\n- **Food**: \n  - No food at (3,1).\n- **Outcome**: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n### Evaluating Food\n\nNow, let's consider the food positions:\n\n1. **Food at (6,3)**:\n   - Distance from head (3,2): Δx = 3, Δy = 1.\n   - To reach it, the snake needs to move right and up.\n   - Current move options don't directly reach it, but moving right (R) gets closer.\n\n2. **Food at (4,4)**:\n   - Currently under the tail at (4,4).\n   - **Special Rule**: Can only eat if:\n     1. Body moves away (tail moves when snake moves forward).\n     2. Head moves onto the food cell.\n   - Currently, the tail is at (4,4), and the segment before it is at (4,5).\n   - If the snake moves right (R) to (4,2):\n     - New head: (4,2)\n     - Body shifts: new tail is at (4,5), so (4,4) is now free.\n     - But head is not moving to (4,4), so cannot eat.\n   - If the snake moves down (D) to (3,1):\n     - New head: (3,1)\n     - Body shifts: new tail is at (2,3), so (4,4) is now free.\n     - Still, head not moving to (4,4), so cannot eat.\n   - **Tail Reward Danger**: If head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills the snake.\n     - Currently, head at (3,2), tail at (4,4). Not adjacent (distance is √(1² + 2²) = √5 > 1), so no danger even if we could eat.\n\n### Decision Making\n\nGiven the immediate options:\n\n- **Right (R)**: Safe, moves towards food at (6,3).\n- **Down (D)**: Safe, but moves away from both foods.\n- **Up (U)**: Leads to collision, invalid.\n\nBetween R and D, R is better because it moves towards the food at (6,3), which is positive and has a limited lifespan (5 turns left).\n\n### Verifying Tail Movement\n\nJust to ensure, let's see how the snake's body moves if we choose R:\n\n- Current body: [(3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4)]\n- Move R to (4,2):\n  - New head: (4,2)\n  - New body: [(4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)]\n  - Tail was at (4,4), now at (4,5). So (4,4) is free, but head is not there, so no eating.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Food\n\nIs there any food adjacent to the head that can be eaten now?\n\n- Current head at (3,2).\n- Adjacent cells:\n  - Right (R): (4,2) - no food.\n  - Up (U): (3,3) - body segment, cannot eat.\n  - Down (D): (3,1) - no food.\n  - Left (L): (2,2) - body segment, cannot eat and also illegal move.\n\nNo immediate food to eat, so the goal is to move towards the food at (6,3).\n\n### Potential Future Moves\n\nAfter moving R to (4,2), next possible moves would be:\n\n- From (4,2), direction R:\n  - Can't reverse to L.\n  - U to (4,3): check walls/body.\n    - (4,3) is not a wall or body (current body after move: [(4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)]).\n  - D to (4,1): \n    - (4,1) is an internal wall → invalid.\n  - R to (5,2): \n    - Not a wall or body → valid.\n  \nSo, moving R now sets up to move towards (6,3) in future steps.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe best immediate action is to move Right (R), as it is safe and moves towards the positive food at (6,3).\n\n\\boxed{R}",

(5,6) - value: 1, life_span: 10\n\nAll foods are positive (+1 reward, +1 length).\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (4,2), the snake can move:\n- Up (U): (4,3)\n- Down (D): (4,1)\n- Left (L): (3,2)\n- Right (R): (5,2)\n\nBut we have to consider:\n1. **No instant reverse**: Last move was R, so cannot move L (opposite of R).\n   - So, cannot move Left to (3,2).\n   \n2. **Wall collisions**:\n   - Moving Right to (5,2): x=5 is within 0-7, y=2 is within 0-7, no wall there.\n   - Moving Up to (4,3): x=4 is within 0-7, y=3 is within 0-7, no wall there.\n   - Moving Down to (4,1): x=4 is within 0-7, y=1 is within 0-7, but check internal obstacles: (4,1) is an obstacle! So cannot move Down.\n\nSo, possible moves after considering walls and no reverse: Right (R) and Up (U).\n\n### Checking for Collisions with Body\n\nNow, let's see where the snake's body is to avoid collisions.\n\nCurrent body segments (excluding head):\n- (3,2)\n- (2,2)\n- (2,3)\n- (3,3)\n- (3,4)\n- (3,5)\n- (4,5)\n\n**Move Right to (5,2)**:\n- Is (5,2) in body segments? No.\n- So, safe.\n\n**Move Up to (4,3)**:\n- Is (4,3) in body segments? Let's see:\n  - (3,3) is in body, but not (4,3).\n  - Wait, no (4,3) in the list. So, safe.\n\nBoth moves seem safe from body collision.\n\n### Checking Food Positions\n\nNow, let's see if moving in any direction can eat food.\n\nFood positions:\n1. (6,3)\n2. (4,4)\n3. (5,6)\n\n**Move Right to (5,2)**:\n- Next head position: (5,2)\n- Is there food at (5,2)? No.\n- So, no food eaten.\n\n**Move Up to (4,3)**:\n- Next head position: (4,3)\n- Is there food at (4,3)? No.\n- So, no food eaten.\n\nHmm, neither move directly eats food. But let's think ahead: maybe moving towards food is better.\n\n### Planning Ahead\n\nLet's see where the foods are relative to the head (4,2):\n\n1. (6,3): To the right and up.\n   - To reach (6,3), could go Right then Up, or Up then Right.\n2. (4,4): Directly above.\n   - To reach (4,4), can go Up to (4,3), then Up to (4,4).\n3. (5,6): To the right and up.\n   - Far away, life_span is 10, so no rush.\n\n**Option 1: Move Right to (5,2)**:\n- Next head: (5,2)\n- Then possible moves from there (assuming direction is R):\n  - Can't go Left (reverse), so can go U, D, R.\n  - From (5,2), moving Up to (5,3) gets closer to (6,3).\n\n**Option 2: Move Up to (4,3)**:\n- Next head: (4,3)\n- Then can move towards (4,4) next.\n\nBetween (6,3) and (4,4), (4,4) is closer (distance 2 vs distance 3 from head).\n\nAlso, (4,4) has life_span 7, (6,3) has 4. So (6,3) will disappear sooner, but still have time.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger\n\nThere's a special rule: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the new tail would collide with the head.\n\nCurrent tail is the last segment: (4,5).\n\nIs head adjacent to tail? Head is (4,2), tail is (4,5). Adjacent means distance of 1 in x or y, not both.\n- Distance in y: |5-2| = 3, x is same, so not adjacent.\n\nSo, no danger from this rule currently.\n\n### Checking if Food is Under Snake's Body\n\nFood can spawn under body but can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves onto it.\n\nCurrent food positions:\n- (6,3): not under body.\n- (4,4): is (4,4) under body? Let's see body segments:\n  - (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)\n  - No (4,4), so not under body.\n- (5,6): is (5,6) under body? No.\n\nSo, no food under body to consider.\n\n### Deciding the Move\n\nBetween moving Right and Up:\n- Moving Right (to (5,2)) doesn't eat food but positions towards (6,3).\n- Moving Up (to (4,3)) doesn't eat food but positions towards (4,4).\n\n(4,4) is closer and has longer life_span, so maybe better to go towards it.\n\nFrom (4,3), next move could be Up to (4,4) to eat it.\n\nAlternatively, moving Right to (5,2), then Up to (5,3), then Right to (6,3) to eat that.\n\nBut (6,3) has shorter life_span (4), current turn is 22, so disappears at turn 26. We have 4 turns to reach it.\n\nFrom (4,2):\n- Right to (5,2) (turn 22)\n- Up to (5,3) (turn 23)\n- Right to (6,3) (turn 24) - eats it at turn 24, before it disappears at 26.\n\nSo, possible to reach (6,3) in time.\n\nBut (4,4) is reachable in 2 moves:\n- Up to (4,3) (turn 22)\n- Up to (4,4) (turn 23) - eats it.\n\nBoth foods are reachable in time. Which is better?\n\n(4,4) is closer, so less risk, and longer life_span means more flexibility.\n\nAlso, moving Right now might lead to being stuck near the right wall later.\n\n### Checking for Potential Traps\n\nAfter moving Right to (5,2):\n- Then Up to (5,3)\n- Then Right to (6,3) (eat)\n- Then where? From (6,3), possible moves:\n  - Left (but snake is long, might be risky)\n  - Up to (6,4)\n  - Down to (6,2)\n  \nFrom (6,3), moving Left would go back towards body, which is growing, so could be risky.\n\nAlternatively, after eating (6,3), could go Up to (6,4), but then what?\n\nLooking at the snake's body after eating (6,3):\nCurrent length is 8 (positions), eating adds one, so new tail is where? Original tail was (4,5), after moves:\n- Original body: [(4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)]\n- Move R: head to (5,2), tail moves from (4,5) to (3,5)\n- Move U: head to (5,3), tail to (2,2)\n- Move R: head to (6,3), eat, so tail stays at (2,3)\nNew body: [(6,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5)] (length 10)\nFrom (6,3), moving Left to (5,3) - but (5,3) is in body (second segment), so collision.\nMoving Up to (6,4) - check if safe:\n- (6,4) is not in body, no walls.\nMoving Down to (6,2) - (6,2) is not in body, no walls.\nSo after eating (6,3), can go Up or Down, but not Left.\n\nBut seems risky to go towards the right edge.\n\nAlternatively, going towards (4,4):\n- Move U to (4,3)\n- Move U to (4,4) - eat\nThen snake grows, new tail is where?\nOriginal tail is (4,5)\nAfter first move U to (4,3), tail moves to (3,5)\nAfter second move U to (4,4), eat, so tail stays at (3,5)\nNew body: [(4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5)] (length 9)\nFrom (4,4), possible moves:\n- U to (4,5) - but (4,5) is current tail, which will move to (3,4), so safe.\n- D to (4,3) - but (4,3) is in body (second segment), so collision.\n- L to (3,4) - (3,4) is in body (eighth segment), collision.\n- R to (5,4) - check if wall or body: no wall, not in body.\nSo after eating (4,4), can go U or R.\n\nGoing U to (4,5) - then next move options from (4,5):\n- U to (4,6) - but (4,6) is an internal obstacle, so can't.\n- D to (4,4) - in body.\n- L to (3,5) - in body.\n- R to (5,5) - possible.\nSo only R is possible after U to (4,5).\n\nAlternatively, after eating (4,4), go R to (5,4), then can go U to (5,5), etc.\n\nSeems more flexible than going towards (6,3).\n\n### Final Decision\n\nGiven that moving Up towards (4,4) seems to offer more flexibility and less risk of getting trapped near the wall, and both foods are equally valuable, I'll choose to move Up to position myself to eat (4,4) next turn.\n\n\\boxed{U}",

        "thinking": "Alright, let's tackle this Snake game scenario step by step. I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding any risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**Current Turn**: 23  \n**Walls**:\n- Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (so the grid is from (1,1) to (6,6) excluding walls)\n- Internal obstacles: (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6)\n\n**Snake Positions**: \nHead at (4,3), then [(4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5)]  \nSo the tail is at (3,5).\n\n**Snake Head Direction**: Currently moving Up (\"U\").\n\n**Food**:\n1. (6,3) - value: 1, life_span: 3\n2. (4,4) - value: 1, life_span: 6\n3. (5,6) - value: 1, life_span: 9\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (4,3) moving Up (\"U\"), the possible next moves are:\n- Continue Up (U): (4,4)\n- Turn Left (L): (3,3)\n- Turn Right (R): (5,3)\n- Cannot move Down (D) because that's the opposite of current direction (U).\n\nNow, let's evaluate each possible move:\n\n1. **Move Up (U) to (4,4)**:\n   - Check if (4,4) is valid:\n     - Not a wall: Yes, within grid and not in internal obstacles.\n     - Not colliding with body: Snake body segments are (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5). (4,4) is not in this list.\n     - Food at (4,4): Yes, positive food with value 1.\n     - Check Tail Reward Danger: Tail is at (3,5). Is (4,4) adjacent to tail? Distance from (4,4) to (3,5) is sqrt((4-3)^2 + (4-5)^2) = sqrt(1 + 1) = sqrt(2) ~ 1.41, so they are diagonally adjacent but not directly adjacent (direct adjacency is up, down, left, right). So no danger here.\n   - Outcome: Eat positive food, length increases by 1, score +1.\n\n2. **Move Left (L) to (3,3)**:\n   - Check if (3,3) is valid:\n     - Not a wall: Yes.\n     - Not colliding with body: (3,3) is in the body segments (specifically, it's the 6th segment from the head). So this would be a collision.\n   - Outcome: Collision with body → death. Not valid.\n\n3. **Move Right (R) to (5,3)**:\n   - Check if (5,3) is valid:\n     - Not a wall: Yes.\n     - Not colliding with body: (5,3) is not in the body segments.\n     - Food at (5,3): No food listed there.\n   - Outcome: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n### Comparing Valid Moves\n\nWe have two valid immediate moves:\n1. Up (U) to (4,4): Eat positive food, score +1, length increases.\n2. Right (R) to (5,3): Safe move, no food.\n\nNow, let's consider the implications:\n\n- Moving Up to eat the food at (4,4):\n  - Pros: Immediate score gain, longer snake (which can be good for future opportunities).\n  - Cons: After eating, the snake grows, so its tail doesn't move next turn. Need to ensure that future moves don't lead to collisions due to increased length.\n  \n- Moving Right to (5,3):\n  - Pros: Safe, keeps options open.\n  - Cons: Misses immediate food, but other foods are still available (like (6,3) and (5,6)).\n\nLooking at the food:\n- (6,3): life_span 3, so it will disappear in 3 turns (including current turn). From (5,3), can reach (6,3) in one move next turn.\n- (4,4): life_span 6, so it will stay for a while.\n- (5,6): life_span 9, so it's not urgent.\n\nIf we move Right now to (5,3), next turn we can move Right again to (6,3) to eat that food before it disappears. This seems like a good plan to maximize food collection.\n\nAlternatively, if we move Up now to (4,4), next turn from (4,4) we can consider moves based on the new snake length. But we might miss the (6,3) food if we don't act quickly.\n\nGiven that (6,3) will disappear soon (in 3 turns), it's better to prioritize eating it. Moving Right now sets us up to eat (6,3) next turn.\n\n### Potential Risks\n\nIs there any immediate danger in moving Right to (5,3)?\n- Next turn from (5,3), moving Right to (6,3) is safe:\n  - (6,3) is not a wall, not in body (current body will have moved, tail at (3,5) will move to (3,4), etc.).\n  - No tail reward danger at (6,3).\n\nMoving Up now to (4,4) is also safe, but may delay getting to (6,3).\n\n### Decision\n\nGiven the urgency of the (6,3) food (life_span 3), it's better to prioritize reaching it. Therefore, the best immediate action is to move Right to (5,3), setting up to move Right again next turn to (6,3).\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{R}",

        "thinking": "Alright, let's tackle this Snake game scenario step by step. I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action to take at Turn 24. Here's how I'll approach it:\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions and Walls**:\n   - The grid is 8x8 (from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7).\n   - Border walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (meaning we can't move outside these bounds).\n   - Internal obstacles (walls) at: (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6). These are cells the snake cannot move into.\n\n2. **Snake Position and Direction**:\n   - Snake positions (head first): [(5,3), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4)].\n     - Head is at (5,3).\n     - Tail is at (3,4).\n   - Current direction: R (right). This means the snake was moving right to reach (5,3) from (4,3).\n\n3. **Food Items**:\n   - (6,3): value=1, life_span=2 (positive food, disappears after 2 more turns).\n   - (4,4): value=1, life_span=5 (positive food).\n   - (5,6): value=1, life_span=8 (positive food).\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the head at (5,3), the possible moves are:\n- **Up (U)**: (5,4)\n- **Down (D)**: (5,2)\n- **Left (L)**: (4,3)\n- **Right (R)**: (6,3)\n\nBut we must consider:\n- **No instant reverse**: Current direction is R, so we can't move L (left) next, as that would be opposite to R.\n- **Wall collisions**: \n  - Up to (5,4): Not a wall.\n  - Down to (5,2): Not a wall.\n  - Right to (6,3): Not a wall (x=7 is wall, but 6 is okay).\n- **Body collisions**:\n  - Moving right to (6,3): Check if (6,3) is in snake body. Snake body is from (4,3) to (3,4). (6,3) is not in the body.\n  - Moving up to (5,4): Check if (5,4) is in body. No.\n  - Moving down to (5,2): Check if (5,2) is in body. No.\n  \nSo possible moves: U, D, R.\n\n### Evaluating Each Move\n\n1. **Right (R) to (6,3)**:\n   - This is where the food (6,3,2,1) is located.\n   - Eating this food:\n     - Value: +1, length increases by 1.\n     - Check \"Tail Reward Danger\":\n       - Tail is at (3,4). Is (6,3) adjacent to (3,4)? \n         - Adjacent means same x and y differs by 1 or same y and x differs by 1.\n         - (6,3) and (3,4): x diff is 3, y diff is 1. Not adjacent (must have one coordinate same and other diff by 1).\n       - So no danger here.\n   - After eating, new head is at (6,3), new tail is where? Normally tail moves forward, but since length increases, tail stays where it is (but the last segment before tail is added). So new body would be [(6,3), (5,3), (4,3), ..., (3,4)].\n   - Then next move, head is at (6,3), direction R, can't move L (but R would go to (7,3) which is wall, so next move would have to be U or D.\n   - Seems safe for now.\n\n2. **Up (U) to (5,4)**:\n   - No food here.\n   - Next head position: (5,4).\n   - Then possible moves: U (to (5,5)), D (can't, reverse), L (to (4,4)), R (to (6,4)).\n   - (4,4) has food, but not immediately beneficial unless we plan to go there next.\n\n3. **Down (D) to (5,2)**:\n   - No food here.\n   - Next head position: (5,2).\n   - Then possible moves: U (can't, reverse), D (to (5,1)), L (to (4,2)), R (to (6,2)).\n   - Not immediately beneficial.\n\n### Considering Food\n\n- (6,3): life_span=2, so disappears after this turn (since countdown decreases this turn, then next turn it's gone).\n- (4,4): life_span=5, so has more time.\n- (5,6): life_span=8, plenty of time.\n\nBest to prioritize (6,3) as it's about to disappear, and it's safe to eat now.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Dangers\n\nMoving R to (6,3):\n- Next turn, head at (6,3), direction R.\n- Then possible moves: U (to (6,4)), D (to (6,2)), R is wall.\n- Body would be [(6,3), (5,3), (4,3), ..., (3,4)].\n- No immediate collision risks in next moves.\n\n### Alternative Considerations\n\nIf we don't eat (6,3), it disappears next turn, and we have other foods, but they're not urgent.\nBut eating (6,3) gives +1 score and grows snake safely.\n\n### Decision\n\nBest immediate action is to move **Right (R)** to eat the food at (6,3).\n\n\\boxed{R}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding any risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**Current Turn**: 25  \n**Walls**:\n- Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (so the grid is 8x8 from (0,0) to (7,7))\n- Internal obstacles: (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6)\n\n**Snake Positions**: \nHead at (6,3), then body segments in order: (5,3), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4)\n\n**Snake Head Direction**: R (Right, meaning it was moving towards increasing x, so from (5,3) to (6,3))\n\n**Food Items**:\n1. (4,4) - value: 1, life_span: 4\n2. (5,6) - value: 1, life_span: 7\n3. (3,4) - value: 1, life_span: 10\n\n### Visualizing the Snake and Food\n\nLet me try to visualize the snake's body to understand possible moves.\n\nSnake body segments:\n1. Head: (6,3)\n2. (5,3)\n3. (4,3)\n4. (4,2)\n5. (3,2)\n6. (2,2)\n7. (2,3)\n8. (3,3)\n9. (3,4)\n\nThe tail is at (3,4).\n\nFood positions:\n- (4,4)\n- (5,6)\n- (3,4) - This is interesting because the tail is at (3,4), and there's food there.\n\n### Possible Moves from Current Position (6,3), Direction R\n\nFrom direction R, the possible moves are:\n- U (Up): (6,4)\n- D (Down): (6,2)\n- R (Right): (7,3) - but x=7 is a wall, so invalid\n- L (Left): (5,3) - but this is the immediate body segment, so collision\n\nWait, the rule says:\n- Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn. Current direction is R, so opposite is L. So L is not allowed because it's the reverse of R.\n  \nSo possible moves are U, D, R. But R leads to wall, so only U and D.\n\n### Checking Moves:\n\n1. **Move U (Up) to (6,4)**:\n   - Check if (6,4) is valid:\n     - Not a wall: y=4 is not a border (y=0 and y=7 are borders), and no internal obstacles at (6,4).\n     - Not part of the body: \n       - Body segments: (5,3), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4)\n       - (6,4) is not in this list.\n   - Safe move.\n   - Is there food at (6,4)? No.\n   - So just move without eating.\n\n2. **Move D (Down) to (6,2)**:\n   - Check if (6,2) is valid:\n     - Not a wall: y=2 is not a border, no internal obstacles at (6,2).\n     - Not part of the body: \n       - (6,2) is not in body segments.\n   - Safe move.\n   - Is there food at (6,2)? No.\n   - Just move without eating.\n\n### Considering Food:\n\nThere's food at:\n- (4,4): Not reachable in one move from (6,3).\n- (5,6): Not reachable in one move.\n- (3,4): The tail is at (3,4), and food is there. \n\nSpecial rule: \n- If head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n- Is head adjacent to tail? Head at (6,3), tail at (3,4). \n  - Adjacent means one step away in any direction (including diagonally? Usually in Snake, adjacent is up, down, left, right, not diagonally).\n  - Distance: |6-3|=3, |3-4|=1, so not adjacent (needs dx + dy = 1 for adjacency).\n  - So not adjacent, so no danger from eating tail food.\n\nBut can we eat the food at (3,4)? \n- Currently, the tail is at (3,4) with food. To eat it:\n  - The body must move away from (3,4), and then head moves onto it.\n  - Currently, the segment before tail is (3,3), so tail is at (3,4).\n  - Next move, if we don't move towards tail, tail will move to (3,3), and new tail will be at (3,3), but the food is at (3,4), so head can't reach it in one move from (6,3).\n  - So we can't eat (3,4) now.\n\n### Other Considerations:\n\nIs there any immediate danger in next moves?\n- Current head at (6,3), moving U to (6,4):\n  - Next turn, direction is U, cannot move D (reverse).\n  - From (6,4), possible moves: U (6,5), L (5,4), R (7,4) - R is wall, so U or L.\n- Moving D to (6,2):\n  - Next turn, direction is D, cannot move U.\n  - From (6,2), possible moves: D (6,1), L (5,2), R (7,2) - R is wall, so D or L.\n\nBoth U and D seem safe now, but which is better for future?\n\nLooking at food:\n- (4,4): to reach, need to go left and up.\n- (5,6): need to go up and left.\n- (3,4): need to go left.\n\nMoving U seems to go towards (5,6) and (4,4), while D goes away from food.\n\n### Checking if moving U can lead to future food:\n\nFrom (6,4):\n- Next move could be L to (5,4), then L to (4,4) to eat food at (4,4).\n- Or U to (6,5), then L to (5,5), then U to (5,6) to eat food at (5,6).\n\nMoving D to (6,2):\n- Moves away from food, not helpful.\n\n### Potential Danger in Moving U:\n\nIs there any immediate danger if we move U to (6,4)?\n- Next possible moves from (6,4): U to (6,5) or L to (5,4).\n- From (6,5): can go U to (6,6) - but (6,6) is not a wall, but (6,7) is, so (6,6) is safe unless body is there.\n  - Body will be: new head at (6,4), then (6,3), (5,3), etc. (6,6) is not in body.\n- From (5,4): can go towards (4,4) for food.\n\nSeems safe.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nBest immediate move is Up (U) to (6,4), as it moves towards available food without immediate danger and avoids moving into walls or body.\n\n\\boxed{U}",

So, possible moves are U, L.\n\nNow, let's evaluate U and L:\n\n#### Move Up (U) to (6,5):\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Is (6,5) a wall? No (x=6 is not a border, and (6,5) is not an internal obstacle).\n  - Is (6,5) a body segment? Let's see the body segments:\n    - (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3)\n    - (6,5) is not in this list; safe.\n- Check for food:\n  - (6,5) is not a food position (foods are at (4,4), (5,6), (3,4)).\n  - No food to eat here.\n- After moving, the new head is (6,5), and the tail (3,3) moves away, so the new body is [(6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3)].\n\n#### Move Left (L) to (5,4):\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Is (5,4) a wall? No.\n  - Is (5,4) a body segment? Checking the list: no.\n- Check for food:\n  - (5,4) is not a food position.\n- After moving, new head is (5,4), tail moves away, new body: [(5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3)].\n\n### Evaluating Food Opportunities:\nNow, let's see if moving towards any food is possible or beneficial.\n\n1. **Food at (4,4)**:\n   - Current head at (6,4). To reach (4,4), need to move left twice: first to (5,4), then to (4,4).\n   - After first move to (5,4), next move could be L to (4,4).\n   - (4,4) is not under any body segment currently (body is at (6,4), (6,3), etc., not at (4,4)).\n   - Eating (4,4) would increase length by 1, score by 1.\n   - Need to ensure that after eating, the new tail doesn't cause a collision. Current tail is at (3,3). After eating, the tail would be at (2,3), and the new segment would be at (4,4). No immediate collision risk.\n\n2. **Food at (5,6)**:\n   - From (6,4), path could be U to (6,5), then U to (6,6), then L to (5,6).\n   - But (6,6) is not a wall, but (5,6) is not under body, so possible.\n   - However, this is a longer path, and other foods might be better.\n\n3. **Food at (3,4)**:\n   - From (6,4), path: L to (5,4), L to (4,4), L to (3,4).\n   - Three moves, but (4,4) is also food, so might eat that first.\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger:\nThis is when the head is adjacent to the tail, and the tail cell has positive food. Eating it would kill the snake because the head and newly grown tail would collide.\n- Current tail is at (3,3).\n- Adjacent to tail: (2,3), (4,3), (3,2), (3,4).\n- Head is at (6,4), not adjacent to tail (3,3). So no immediate danger here.\n\n### Life Span of Foods:\n- (4,4): life_span=3 (will disappear after 3 turns, including current)\n- (5,6): life_span=6\n- (3,4): life_span=9\nGiven that, (4,4) is the most urgent to eat if possible.\n\n### Deciding the Move:\nFrom current position (6,4), moving L to (5,4) is safe and is the first step towards (4,4). Moving U to (6,5) doesn't help in getting closer to any food immediately.\n\n### Verifying Safety After Move to (5,4):\nAfter moving to (5,4), next possible moves would be from direction L (since we moved L). Opposite is R, so cannot move R next. Possible would be U, D, L.\n- To reach (4,4), next move would be L to (4,4), which is allowed (not opposite of L).\n- Then can eat (4,4).\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe best immediate action is to move Left (L) towards the food at (4,4), which is about to disappear soon (life_span=3).\n\n\\boxed{L}",

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State\n\nFirst, let's break down the given information to understand the current state of the Snake game.\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions and Walls**:\n   - The grid is 8x8 (since x and y range from 0 to 7).\n   - Border walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So, the snake cannot move outside these bounds.\n   - Internal obstacles (walls) are at: (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6). These are cells the snake cannot move into.\n\n2. **Snake Position and Direction**:\n   - Snake positions (head first): [(5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3)].\n     - Head is at (5,4).\n     - Tail is at (2,3).\n   - Current head direction: Left (L). This means the snake was moving left in the previous turn.\n\n3. **Food Information**:\n   - Three food items:\n     - (4,4): value=2, life_span=1\n     - (5,6): value=5, life_span=1\n     - (3,4): value=8, life_span=1\n   - All foods have a life_span of 1, meaning they will disappear after the current turn if not eaten.\n\n### Possible Moves and Constraints\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However, there are constraints:\n\n1. **No Instant Reverse**: Since the current direction is Left (L), the snake cannot move Right (R) in the next move.\n   - Allowed moves: U, D, L.\n\n2. **Wall and Obstacle Collision**: The snake cannot move into a cell that is a wall or an obstacle.\n   - Current head position: (5,4).\n   - Possible moves from (5,4):\n     - U (Up): (5,5) - Check if this is a wall or obstacle.\n       - y=5: Not a border wall.\n       - Internal obstacles: (1,5) is at x=1, y=5; (5,5) is not in the list. So, (5,5) is free.\n     - D (Down): (5,3) - Check:\n       - y=3: Not a border wall.\n       - Snake body: (6,3), (5,3), etc. (5,3) is part of the body (third segment). Moving here would cause a collision unless it's the tail.\n       - Tail is at (2,3), so (5,3) is not the tail. Hence, moving down would collide with body.\n     - L (Left): (4,4) - Check:\n       - x=4: Not a border wall.\n       - Internal obstacles: (4,6), (4,1) - (4,4) is not listed. So, it's free.\n       - Snake body: Check if (4,4) is part of the body. Current body positions: from (6,4) to (2,3). (4,4) is not in the list. So, it's free.\n     - R (Right): Not allowed due to no instant reverse.\n\nSo, possible moves without immediate collision: U, L.\n\n### Checking for Food\n\nNow, let's see if moving U or L leads to food:\n\n1. **Move U to (5,5)**:\n   - Is there food at (5,5)? Checking food positions:\n     - (4,4), (5,6), (3,4) - No, no food at (5,5).\n   - So, moving U doesn't eat any food.\n\n2. **Move L to (4,4)**:\n   - Is there food at (4,4)? Yes, value=2, life_span=1.\n   - Can we eat it? \n     - The food is under the snake's body if any segment is at (4,4). Current body segments: (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,2), etc. (4,4) is not part of the body, so it's not under the snake.\n     - So, we can eat it directly by moving to (4,4).\n\nBut we must also check for **Tail Reward Danger**:\n- After eating, the snake grows by 1 segment (since it's positive food).\n- Current tail is at (2,3). After growth, the new tail will be at (2,3) (since the tail doesn't move when eating).\n- Is the head adjacent to the tail after moving to (4,4)?\n  - New head: (4,4), tail: (2,3).\n  - Adjacent means Manhattan distance of 1: |4-2| + |4-3| = 2 + 1 = 3, which is not 1. So, not adjacent.\n  - Therefore, no tail reward danger.\n\n### Other Considerations\n\n- **Life Span of Foods**: All foods have life_span=1, so they will disappear after this turn if not eaten.\n  - (4,4) is the only one we can reach this turn.\n  - (5,6) and (3,4) are out of reach in one move.\n\n- **Future Moves**: While not directly relevant for the immediate action, considering that (5,6) is above and (3,4) is to the left, moving left now to (4,4) might position us better to reach (3,4) next turn, which has a higher value (8).\n\n### Evaluating Moves\n\n1. **Move U to (5,5)**:\n   - No food eaten.\n   - Safe move, but doesn't increase score.\n   - Next turn, we could consider moving towards other foods, but they disappear after this turn.\n\n2. **Move L to (4,4)**:\n   - Eat food with value=2.\n   - Safe move (no collision, no tail reward danger).\n   - Positions us closer to (3,4) which has higher value, but it will disappear after this turn, so not reachable next turn.\n\nGiven that (5,6) is at (5,6), which is two moves away (first U to (5,5), then U to (5,6)), but it will disappear after this turn, so we can't reach it in time.\n\nSimilarly, (3,4) is at (3,4), which is two moves away from (5,4): L to (4,4), then L to (3,4), but again, it will disappear after this turn.\n\nTherefore, the only food we can eat this turn is at (4,4).\n\n### Decision\n\nBetween U and L:\n- U: No immediate benefit (no food), but safe.\n- L: Eat food (+2), safe, and no better options this turn.\n\nGiven that the other foods will disappear and we can't reach them in time, the best immediate action is to eat the available food at (4,4).\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{L}",

        "thinking": "Alright, let's tackle this Snake game scenario step by step. I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**Current Turn**: 28  \n**Walls**:\n- Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (so the grid is from (0,0) to (7,7))\n- Internal obstacles: (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6)\n\n**Snake Positions**: \nHead at (4,4), followed by:\n- (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3)\n\n**Snake Head Direction**: L (Left, meaning the last move was to the left, from (5,4) to (4,4))\n\n**Food Items**:\n1. (5,6): value=4, life_span=1\n2. (3,4): value=7, life_span=1\n3. (4,5): value=10, life_span=1\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (4,4) and last direction L (Left), the possible moves are:\n- U (Up): (4,5)\n- D (Down): (4,3)\n- L (Left): (3,4)\n- R (Right): (5,4)\n\nBut we cannot reverse the direction instantly, so we cannot go R (Right) because that would be opposite to L (Left). So valid moves: U, D, L.\n\n### Evaluating Each Move\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n1. **U (Up) to (4,5)**:\n   - Check for walls: (4,5) is not a wall (no internal obstacle at (4,5) and within borders.\n   - Check for body collision: The snake's body segments are at (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3). (4,5) is not in this list.\n   - Food at (4,5): Yes, value=10, life_span=1.\n     - Eating this would increase length by 1 and score by 10.\n     - Check for Tail Reward Danger: The tail is at (2,3). Is (2,3) adjacent to head (4,5)? \n       - Adjacent means same x and y differs by 1 or same y and x differs by 1.\n       - (4,5) and (2,3): x diff=2, y diff=2 → not adjacent. So no danger.\n   - So this move is safe and gets a high-value food.\n\n2. **D (Down) to (4,3)**:\n   - (4,3) is part of the snake's body (6th segment). Moving here would collide with the body → deadly.\n   - So this move is invalid.\n\n3. **L (Left) to (3,4)**:\n   - Check for walls: (3,4) is not a wall.\n   - Check for body collision: (3,4) is not in the body segments.\n   - Food at (3,4): Yes, value=7, life_span=1.\n     - Eating this would increase length by 1 and score by 7.\n     - Tail is at (2,3). Is (2,3) adjacent to (3,4)?\n       - x diff=1, y diff=1 → diagonally adjacent, but adjacency is only up/down/left/right, not diagonal. So no.\n     - So safe to eat.\n   - But compared to moving Up to (4,5) which gives 10, this gives less.\n\n### Comparing Moves\n\n- U (Up): score +10, safe.\n- L (Left): score +7, safe.\n- D (Down): deadly.\n\nBetween U and L, U gives a higher score, so it's better.\n\n### Checking for Other Considerations\n\nAre there any other risks or considerations?\n\n- The food at (4,5) has life_span=1, meaning it will disappear after this turn if not eaten now. So we should prioritize it.\n- The other foods:\n  - (5,6): life_span=1, but moving there would require multiple steps and may not be reachable before it disappears.\n  - (3,4): life_span=1, but lower value than (4,5).\n\n### Potential Future Moves\n\nIf we go U to (4,5), next turn the head is at (4,5), direction U. Possible moves then would be U, L, R (not D, reverse of U). Then we can plan to go towards other foods if they're still there.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe best immediate action is to move Up to (4,5) to eat the high-value food there safely.\n\n\\boxed{U}",

Move Up (U) to (4,6)\n- **Check for Walls**:\n  - (4,6) is an internal obstacle (from the list). So, it's a wall. **Invalid move** (would collide with wall).\n\n#### 2. Move Left (L) to (3,5)\n- **Check for Walls**:\n  - Border walls: x=3 is not 0 or 7; y=5 is not 0 or 7. Not a border wall.\n  - Internal obstacles: (3,5) is not in the list. **Valid**.\n- **Check for Body Collision**:\n  - Snake body segments: (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3).\n  - (3,5) is not in this list. **No collision**.\n- **Check for Food**:\n  - Food at (5,6) and (3,4). (3,5) has no food. **No food**.\n- **Safety**:\n  - Next moves from (3,5): Can go U, L, or R (not D, opposite of L).\n  - Need to ensure future moves are safe, but immediate move is safe.\n\n#### 3. Move Right (R) to (5,5)\n- **Check for Walls**:\n  - Border walls: x=5 is not 0 or 7; y=5 is not 0 or 7. Not a border wall.\n  - Internal obstacles: (5,5) is not in the list. **Valid**.\n- **Check for Body Collision**:\n  - Snake body segments: (5,5) is not in the list. **No collision**.\n- **Check for Food**:\n  - Food at (5,6) and (3,4).

Now, let's consider future possibilities:\n\n- **Move Left (L) to (3,5)**:\n  - Next possible moves from (3,5):\n    - U to (3,6): \n      - Check walls: (3,6) is not a border or internal wall. \n      - Check body: (3,6) is not in body segments. \n      - Food at (3,4) is not here. Safe.\n    - L to (2,5):\n      - Check walls: (2,5) is not a border or internal wall.\n      - Check body: (2,5) is not in body segments.\n      - Food at (3,4) is not here. Safe.\n    - R to (4,5):\n      - Current head is at (4,5), but after moving to (3,5), the body will be [(3,5), (4,5), (4,4), ...].\n      - Moving R to (4,5) would collide with the body segment (4,5). **Invalid**.\n  - So from (3,5), U and L are safe next moves.\n\n- **Move Right (R) to (5,5)**:\n  - Next possible moves from (5,5):\n    - U to (5,6):\n      - Food at (5,6) with value=3, life_span=1.\n      - Check walls: (5,6) is not a border or internal wall.\n      - Check body: (5,6) is not in body segments.\n      - Eating food: \n        - Current tail is at (2,3). After eating, new tail would be at (2,2) (since length increases by 1).\n        - Check Tail Reward Danger: Is head adjacent to tail after eating?\n          - New head at (5,6), new tail at (2,2). Not adjacent (distance is |5-2| + |6-2| = 3 + 4 = 7 > 1). Safe.\n      - So U to (5,6) is safe and gets +3 score.\n    - L to (4,5):\n      - Current body after moving to (5,5) is [(5,5), (4,5), (4,4), ...].\n      - Moving L to (4,5) would collide with body segment (4,5). **Invalid**.\n    - R to (6,5):\n      - Check walls: (6,5) is not a border or internal wall.\n      - Check body: (6,5) is not in body segments.\n      - No food. Safe.\n  - So from (5,5), U and R are safe next moves, with U leading to food.\n\n### Decision\n\nMoving Right (R) to (5,5) opens up the possibility to eat the high-value food at (5,6) in the next move (value=3), whereas moving Left (L) doesn't immediately lead to food. Both moves are safe now, but R offers a better immediate future opportunity.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Food\n\nIs there any food adjacent to the current head (4,5)?\n\n- Adjacent cells:\n  - U: (4,6) - wall.\n  - D: (4,4) - body segment.\n  - L: (3,5) - no food.\n  - R: (5,5) - no food.\n\nNo immediate food to eat, so the choice is based on future opportunities.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nGiven that moving Right (R) to (5,5) allows for potentially eating the high-value food at (5,6) next turn, and both L and R are safe now, R is the better choice.\n\n\\boxed{R}",

        "thinking": "Alright, let's tackle this Snake game scenario step by step. I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action to take at Turn 30. Here's how I'll approach it:\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n1. **Grid Layout**:\n   - The grid is bounded by walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So, the playable area is from x=1 to x=6 and y=1 to y=6.\n   - There are internal obstacles at: (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6). These are like additional walls the snake cannot pass through.\n\n2. **Snake Position and Direction**:\n   - Snake's head is at (5,5), moving Right (R).\n   - The body segments follow in this order: (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2).\n   - The tail is at (2,2).\n\n3. **Food Items**:\n   - (5,6): value=2, life_span=1\n   - (3,4): value=5, life_span=1\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (5,5) moving Right (R), the possible next moves are:\n- **Up (U)**: (5,6)\n- **Down (D)**: (5,4)\n- **Left (L)**: (4,5)\n- **Right (R)**: (6,5)\n\nBut we cannot move opposite to the current direction immediately. Current direction is R, so opposite is L. So, Left (L) is not allowed next.\n\nSo, allowed moves: U, D, R.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each:\n\n#### 1. Move Up (U) to (5,6)\n- Check if (5,6) is valid:\n  - Not a wall: x=5 is within bounds, y=6 is the upper border (y=7 is wall, y=6 is playable).\n  - Not an internal obstacle: (4,6) is an obstacle, but (5,6) is not listed.\n  - Not part of the snake's body: Let's check the snake positions:\n    - Snake segments: (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2)\n    - (5,6) is not in this list.\n  - So, (5,6) is a valid move.\n  \n- Food at (5,6):\n  - There is food at (5,6) with value=2, life_span=1.\n  - Eating it gives +2 score and increases length by 1.\n  - Need to check \"Tail Reward Danger\":\n    - Tail is at (2,2). Is (5,6) adjacent to tail? Adjacent means one cell apart horizontally or vertically.\n    - Distance from (5,6) to (2,2): |5-2|=3, |6-2|=4. Not adjacent (would need at least one of the differences to be 1).\n    - So, no danger from tail.\n\n- After moving to (5,6):\n  - New head: (5,6)\n  - Body: (5,5), (4,5), ..., (3,2), (2,2)\n  - Tail (2,2) moves away, so no collision with new head.\n\n- Is there any immediate collision after this move?\n  - New head at (5,6), which is not in the new body segments (since tail moves away).\n  \n- So, moving Up is safe and gets us +2 score.\n\n#### 2. Move Down (D) to (5,4)\n- Check if (5,4) is valid:\n  - Not a wall.\n  - Not an internal obstacle.\n  - Is it part of the body?\n    - Current body segments include (4,4), (5,4), etc.\n    - (5,4) is the 4th segment in the body.\n    - Moving here would mean the head collides with the body (since the tail moves away, but (5,4) is still in the body).\n    - Wait, let's see:\n      - Current body after head: (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), ...\n      - After moving down, new body is (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), ...\n      - New head is (5,4), which is already in the new body (the old (5,4) is now at position 4 in the body).\n      - So, head would collide with body at (5,4).\n    - Hence, moving Down is a collision and deadly.\n\n- So, Down is not safe.\n\n#### 3. Move Right (R) to (6,5)\n- Check if (6,5) is valid:\n  - Not a wall (x=6 is playable, x=7 is wall).\n  - Not an internal obstacle.\n  - Not in current body segments:\n    - Current body: (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), etc.\n    - (6,5) is not in the list.\n  \n- Food at (6,5)? No food listed there.\n  \n- After moving:\n  - New head: (6,5)\n  - Body: (5,5), (4,5), ..., (2,2)\n  - No collision with body or walls.\n  \n- So, Right is safe but doesn't get us food.\n\n### Comparing Moves\n\n- **Up (U)**: Safe, gets +2 score, increases length.\n- **Right (R)**: Safe, no score.\n- **Down (D)**: Deadly.\n\nBetween U and R, U is better because it gets us food.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Dangers\n\nIs there any immediate danger after moving Up?\n- New head at (5,6). Next possible moves from there:\n  - Current direction would be U (since we moved U).\n  - Next turn, cannot move D (opposite).\n  - Possible moves: U (5,7) - but y=7 is wall, so invalid.\n  - L (4,6) - internal obstacle.\n  - R (6,6) - valid.\n  - So, only R is possible next turn, which is safe (no immediate collision).\n  \nNo immediate danger after moving Up.\n\n### Food Lifespan\n\nFood at (5,6) has life_span=1, meaning it will disappear after this turn if not eaten now. So, this is our only chance to eat it.\n\nFood at (3,4) also has life_span=1, but it's not reachable in one move from (5,5). So, we can't get it this turn.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe best immediate action is to move Up to (5,6) to eat the positive food there, gaining +2 score and increasing the snake's length safely.\n\n\\boxed{U}",

The snake cannot continue in the current direction.\n\n### Possible Moves and Restrictions\n\nFrom the head at (5,6), possible moves are U, D, L, R, but with restrictions:\n\n1. **No Instant Reverse**: Current direction is U, so cannot move D (opposite direction) next.\n   - Even if (5,5) wasn't a body segment, moving D would be invalid due to this rule.\n\n2. **Blocked Directions**:\n   - U: (5,7) - wall → invalid.\n   - D: (5,5) - body segment → collision → invalid.\n   - L: (4,6) - wall → invalid.\n   - R: (6,6) - need to check if it's free.\n\nOnly possible move is R to (6,6).\n\nBut let's verify (6,6):\n\n- Is (6,6) a wall? Border walls are x=0,7 and y=0,7. (6,6) is not on the border.\n- Is (6,6) an internal obstacle? The internal obstacles are (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6). (6,6) is not listed.\n- Is (6,6) occupied by the snake's body? The body segments are from (5,5) to (2,2). (6,6) is not in this list.\n\nThus, (6,6) is free to move into.\n\n### Checking for Food\n\nNow, let's see if moving R to (6,6) leads to any food:\n\n- Food positions: (3,4) and (4,3). Neither is at (6,6), so no food is eaten by moving R.\n\n### Alternative Considerations\n\nIs there any other possible move? Currently, only R seems valid, but let's double-check:\n\n- U: wall.\n- D: body segment + reverse direction.\n- L: wall.\n- R: free.\n\nNo other options. So, R is the only valid move.\n\nBut wait, is there any food under the snake's body that could be eaten by moving away?\n\nLooking at food positions:\n\n1. (3,4): Is this under the snake's body? Snake body positions:\n   - (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2)\n   - (3,4) is not in this list, so not under the body.\n\n2. (4,3): \n   - (4,3) is part of the snake's body (8th segment from head).\n   - To eat this, the head would need to move onto (4,3) after the body moves away.\n   - Currently, the head is at (5,6), and (4,3) is several segments away; not adjacent.\n   - To reach (4,3), the snake would have to maneuver around, which isn't possible in one move.\n\nThus, no food can be eaten in the immediate next move by moving onto a cell where food is under the body.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger\n\nIs there any positive food adjacent to the tail that could cause a collision if eaten?\n\nTail is at (2,2). Adjacent cells to tail:\n\n- U: (2,3)\n- D: (2,1) - y=0 is wall, y=1 is not listed as wall, but internal obstacles are at (4,1), so (2,1) is free.\n- L: (1,2) - internal obstacle (wall).\n- R: (3,2) - part of the snake's body.\n\nFood at (3,4) and (4,3). Neither is adjacent to the tail (2,2). So no danger here.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter evaluating all possible moves:\n\n- Only valid move is R to (6,6).\n- No food is eaten by this move.\n- No immediate dangers or collisions by moving R.\n\nThus, the action to take is:\n\n\\boxed{R}",

Move Right (R) to (7,6)\n- **Wall Check**: x=7 is a border wall → **collision with wall** → **deadly**.\n- **Conclusion**: Not a valid move.\n\n#### 2. Move Up (U) to (6,7)\n- **Wall Check**: y=7 is a border wall → **collision with wall** → **deadly**.\n- **Conclusion**: Not a valid move.\n\n#### 3. Move Down (D) to (6,5)\n- **Wall Check**: (6,5) is not a wall (not listed in borders or internal obstacles).\n- **Body Collision Check**: The snake's body segments are at:\n  - (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2)\n  - (6,5) is not in this list → no body collision.\n- **Food Check**: No food at (6,5).\n- **Safety**: Safe move, no immediate reward.\n- **Future Considerations**: After moving down, the next head position is (6,5), and the tail moves forward, so the segment at (3,2) is removed. The new possible directions would depend on the next state.\n\n### Considering Food\n\nThere are two pieces of food:\n\n1. **(3,4)**: value=3, life_span=1\n   - Distance from head (6,6): Manhattan distance = |6-3| + |6-4| = 3 + 2 = 5.\n   - Life span is 1, so it will disappear next turn. Cannot reach it in one move.\n   \n2. **(4,3)**: value=9, life_span=1\n   - Currently under the snake's body at segment (4,3).\n   - To eat it:\n     - The body must move away from (4,3).\n     - The head must move onto (4,3) in the same turn.\n   - Currently, the head is at (6,6), and the segment at (4,3) is the 10th segment (counting from 0: head is 0, next is 1, ..., (4,3) is 9).\n   - The tail is at (3,2), so the segment at (4,3) is not the tail; it's part of the body.\n   - **Cannot eat it now** because the body is on it, and the head cannot reach it in one move without colliding with other body parts.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger\n\nThere's a mention of \"Tail Reward Danger\": if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\n- Current tail is at (3,2).\n- Adjacent to tail: (2,2), (4,2), (3,1), (3,3).\n- Head is at (6,6), not adjacent to tail → no immediate danger here.\n\n### Available Options\n\nFrom the possible moves:\n- Right (R): deadly (wall).\n- Up (U): deadly (wall).\n- Down (D): safe, no reward.\n\nNo other moves are possible (Left is opposite direction, invalid).\n\n### Decision\n\nSince the only safe move is Down (D), and there's no immediate reward from it, but it avoids death, the best action is to move Down.\n\n### Verifying Down Move\n\nAfter moving Down to (6,5):\n- New head: (6,5).\n- Body segments shift: (6,6) becomes the first body segment, and the tail (3,2) is removed.\n- New snake positions: [(6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (5,5), ..., (4,2)].\n\nThis is safe, and we can plan future moves from there.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe only viable and safe move at this turn is to move Down (D).\n\n\\boxed{D}",

        "score": 10,
        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State\n\nFirst, let's break down the current state to understand the scenario:\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The grid is 8x8 (from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7), with borders at these edges.\n2. **Internal Obstacles**: There are five internal walls at positions (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), and (2,6). These are cells the snake cannot move into.\n3. **Snake Position**: The snake's body is a list of coordinates starting from the head at (6,5) and ending at the tail at (4,2). The direction of the head is \"D\" (Down), meaning the snake was moving downward in the previous turn.\n4. **Food Items**:\n   - At (3,4): value = 2, life_span = 1\n   - At (4,3): value = 8, life_span = 1\n\n### Visualizing the Snake and Food\n\nLet's visualize the snake's body to understand its shape and possible movements:\n\n- Head: (6,5)\n- Next segments: (6,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,2)\n\nFrom the head at (6,5), moving Down (D) implies the previous position was above it, which is (6,6). The snake is moving downward, so the next segment is to the left at (5,6), then down to (5,5), and so on, forming a winding path.\n\n### Possible Moves from Current Head Position (6,5)\n\nGiven the current direction is Down (D), the possible moves are:\n\n1. **Continue Down (D)**: (6,5) → (6,4)\n   - Check (6,4): Currently occupied by the snake's body (from the list: (6,4) is the 8th segment). However, since the tail is at (4,2), and the snake moves by advancing the head and removing the tail, moving into (6,4) would mean the tail moves away from (4,2), and the new tail would be (4,3). \n   - But (6,4) is already occupied by the snake's body before the tail moves, so this would cause a collision unless the tail is moving away from that position at the same time. \n   - Specifically, the segment at (6,4) is followed by (6,3), so after moving, the segment at (6,4) would move to (6,3), and the head would be at (6,4). This means the head would be at (6,4) and the next segment would be at (6,5), which is the previous head position. So no immediate collision unless the head moves into a body segment that isn't the tail.\n   - However, (6,4) is part of the body, and unless it's the tail (which it's not), moving into it would cause a collision. So moving Down is invalid.\n\n2. **Turn Left (L)**: (6,5) → (5,5)\n   - Check (5,5): From the snake's body, (5,5) is the 4th segment. Similar to above, unless it's the tail, moving into it causes a collision.\n   - The tail is at (4,2), so (5,5) is not the tail. Hence, moving Left would collide with the body.\n\n3. **Turn Right (R)**: (6,5) → (7,5)\n   - Check (7,5): \n     - x=7 is a border wall, so this is an invalid move (wall collision).\n\n4. **Reverse Up (U)**: (6,5) → (6,6)\n   - Normally, reversing direction is not allowed (since the current direction is Down, Up is the reverse). \n   - However, the rules state: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\" \n   - Since the current direction is Down, moving Up is the opposite, so this is invalid.\n\n### Re-evaluating Possible Moves\n\nFrom the above, all immediate moves seem to lead to collisions or are invalid due to walls or reversing. This suggests that the snake is in a position where all immediate moves are deadly, which would imply the snake is trapped. However, let's double-check the body segments to ensure we're not missing something.\n\nThe snake's body is:\n\n1. Head: (6,5)\n2. (6,6)\n3. (5,6)\n4. (5,5)\n5. (4,5)\n6. (4,4)\n7. (5,4)\n8. (6,4)\n9. (6,3)\n10. (5,3)\n11. (4,3)\n12. Tail: (4,2)\n\nNow, let's re-examine moving Down to (6,4):\n\n- Current position of (6,4) is the 8th segment.\n- After moving Down:\n  - New head: (6,4)\n  - New body: (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3)\n  - Tail was at (4,2), which is removed.\n- Now, check if (6,4) is in the new body: It is the new head, and also appears later as the 8th segment (original (6,4) is now the 9th position after adding the new head). This would mean the head is overlapping with a body segment, causing a collision.\n\nSimilarly, moving Left to (5,5):\n\n- (5,5) is the 4th segment.\n- After moving:\n  - New head: (5,5)\n  - New body: (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3)\n  - (5,5) is now both the head and the 4th segment → collision.\n\nRight is a wall, Up is reverse. So indeed, all moves seem invalid.\n\n### Checking Food Positions\n\nHowever, the rules mention that food can be under the snake's body, but can only be eaten if:\n1. The body moves away, and\n2. The head moves onto the food cell.\n\nLooking at the food positions:\n1. (3,4): value=2, life=1\n   - Is (3,4) under the snake's body? From the list, no, it's not part of the snake's current body segments.\n2. (4,3): value=8, life=1\n   - (4,3) is the 11th segment (from head to tail counting starts at 0: head is 0, tail is 11).\n   - So, (4,3) is under the snake's body (specifically, the segment before the tail).\n\nThe rule says that food under the body can only be eaten if the body moves away and the head moves onto it. \n\nCurrently, the tail is at (4,2), and the segment before it is at (4,3). If the snake moves such that the tail moves away from (4,2), then the segment at (4,3) would become the new tail, and the food at (4,3) would be exposed if the head can move onto it.\n\nBut to have the head move onto (4,3), the head would need to go from (6,5) to (4,3) in one move, which is impossible (can only move one cell at a time). \n\nAlternatively, if the snake moves in a way that the body moves away from (4,3), but given the current position, this seems impossible in one move.\n\n### Re-examizing Possible Moves with Food\n\nGiven that all immediate moves seem to lead to death, perhaps the only option is to choose the move that delays death the longest or has the least immediate collision. But all seem equally fatal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a misinterpretation of the body segments. Let me list the coordinates in order:\n\nHead: (6,5)\nNext: (6,6) - above head (since head is moving Down, this makes sense)\nThen: (5,6) - left from (6,6)\nThen: (5,5) - down from (5,6)\nThen: (4,5) - left from (5,5)\nThen: (4,4) - down from (4,5)\nThen: (5,4) - right from (4,4)\nThen: (6,4) - right from (5,4)\nThen: (6,3) - down from (6,4)\nThen: (5,3) - left from (6,3)\nThen: (4,3) - left from (5,3)\nTail: (4,2) - down from (4,3)\n\nGiven this, the only possible move that might not immediately collide is Down to (6,4), but (6,4) is already occupied by the body. However, since the tail is moving away from (4,2), the segment at (6,4) would shift to (6,3), and the head would be at (6,4), which would then be adjacent to (6,5), but not overlapping unless the body wraps around in a way that causes collision.\n\nGiven the complexity, and since all moves seem to lead to collision, the snake is trapped and cannot make a safe move. However, since the rules require an action, perhaps the least harmful is to move Down, accepting the collision.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter carefully evaluating all possible moves:\n\n- Up: Reverse direction, invalid.\n- Down: Leads to collision with body at (6,4).\n- Left: Leads to collision with body at (5,5).\n- Right: Wall collision at x=7.\n\nSince all moves are fatal, but the rules require an action, the least harmful is to move Down, accepting the collision.\n\n\\boxed{D}",
