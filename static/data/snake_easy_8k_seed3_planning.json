        "thinking": "<think>First, I'm the AI playing Snake. I need to maximize my score by eating positive food while avoiding risks. I must think at least 5 turns ahead and prioritize long-term survival over immediate rewards.\n\nThe current state is at turn t1 = 0.\n\n**Grid Size**: From the walls, it's an 8x8 grid? Border cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7, that's 8 units each, so 8x8 grid. Internal obstacle at (3,1).\n\n**Snake Position**: Only one segment at (3,3). So the snake is just the head, no body yet. That means when it eats food, it will grow.\n\n**Snake Head Direction**: Currently moving Left (L). So from (3,3), moving left would be to (2,3).\n\n**Food**:\n\n- (3,4) with value 1, life span 10\n\n- (5,2) with value 1, life span 10\n\n- (2,5) with value 1, life span 10\n\nAll food is positive since value is 1, and life span is 10, so they'll disappear after 10 turns, including the current turn, so countdown starts now.\n\nSince the snake has only one segment, the head, there are no body segments to worry about. Also, no tail yet, so the \"Tail Reward Danger\" doesn't apply because there's no tail.\n\nI need to plan moves for the next 5+ turns. Answer should be in the format with actions for turn 0, turn 1, etc., up to at least turn 5 or more.\n\nSince t1=0, I need actions starting from turn 0.\n\nCurrent head position: (3,3), direction L.\n\nPossible moves: I can go Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). But since current direction is L, I cannot instantly reverse to Right (R) on the next turn? No, the rule says: \"No instant reverse\": Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\n\nSo from current direction L, I cannot move Right immediately. I can move Up, Down, or continue Left.\n\nSo for turn 0, possible actions: U, D, L. Not R.\n\nNow, let's see the grid. Walls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, so I can't go there. Also internal obstacle at (3,1).\n\nCurrent position (3,3). If I go Left to (2,3), that should be fine, no wall there. (2,3) is within bounds, x=2, y=3, min x=0, max x=7, so x=2 is ok.\n\nSimilarly, Up to (3,4): y=4, max y=7, min y=0, so y=4 is ok. And (3,4) has food! Food at (3,4) with value 1.\n\nDown to (3,2): y=2, should be ok, but let's check if it's a wall or something. (3,2) is not listed as wall, so ok.\n\nBut internal obstacle is at (3,1), which is below, but (3,2) is fine.\n\nRight is not possible due to no reverse.\n\nNow, eating food: if I go to (3,4), I eat the food there, since it's positive, I gain +1 score, and snake length increases by 1. Since current length is 1, after eating, I'll have two segments: head and tail at (3,3)? When I move to (3,4), the head moves there, and since I ate food, the tail doesn't move, so new positions: head at (3,4), and tail at (3,3). So now snake has two segments.\n\nBut food at (3,4) is eaten, so it disappears.\n\nSimilarly, if I go to other places.\n\nBut I need to think long-term.\n\nFood positions:\n\n- (3,4) - close, directly above\n\n- (5,2) - to the right and down\n\n- (2,5) - left and up\n\nSince I'm at (3,3), and direction L, so moving left would be towards (2,3), which is closer to (2,5).\n\n(2,5) is at (2,5), so from (3,3), left to (2,3), then need to go up to (2,4), then (2,5).\n\nSimilarly, (3,4) is directly above, so if I go up now, I eat it immediately.\n\n(5,2) is down-right, but since I can't go right now, I'd have to go down or something first.\n\nBut let's think about risks. Currently, no body, so no collision risk except walls or obstacles.\n\nWalls are borders and (3,1).\n\nAlso, food life span: all have life span 10, so they last 10 turns from now. Since t=0, they disappear after t=10, meaning on turn 10 they are gone? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 0, life span 10, after turn 0, it becomes 9, and so on, until 0, then disappears.\n\nBut since life span is 10, and we start at turn 0, it should be there until turn 9, and disappear at turn 10? Let's clarify.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo at turn t, with life_span L, it decreases to L-1 at turn t+1, and when it reaches 0, it disappears.\n\nFor example, food with life span 10 at turn 0: at turn 0, it exists, countdown 10; after turn 0 (before turn 1), countdown decreases to 9? The rule says \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", but it doesn't specify when.\n\nI think it's better to interpret: at the start of turn, food has countdown C. During the turn, if snake moves to it, it can be eaten. At the end of the turn, countdown decreases by 1. If countdown reaches 0 after decrease, it disappears.\n\nBut for eating, it happens when head moves onto it during the turn.\n\nIn this case, at turn 0, all food has life span 10, so they have 10 turns left, meaning they will be there for turns 0 to 9, and disappear at turn 10.\n\nCountdown starts at 10 at turn 0, decreases to 9 at turn 1, to 8 at turn 2, ..., to 0 at turn 10, and when it decreases to 0, it disappears, so not available on turn 10.\n\nSo available from turn 0 to turn 9.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut since life span is 10, and we're at turn 0, plenty of time.\n\nNow back to decision.\n\nIf I go up to (3,4) at turn 0, I eat the food immediately. Snake grows to length 2, positions: head at (3,4), tail at (3,3). Direction after move: since I moved up, new direction is U.\n\nThen, for next turn, I can move U, D, L, R, but cannot reverse down immediately? Current new direction U, so cannot move D on next turn.\n\nPossible moves from (3,4): U to (3,5), D to (3,3), L to (2,4), R to (4,4).\n\nBut D to (3,3) is where the tail is, but since tail will move when I don't eat, but if I move to (3,3), which has tail, but when I move, the tail also moves, so it might be ok.\n\nRule: \"But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo moving to tail position is safe because the tail moves away.\n\nIn this case, after eating at (3,4), snake is head (3,4) and tail (3,3). If I move down to (3,3), I would be moving to tail position. Since tail is there, but when I move, the head moves to (3,3), and since I don't eat food (no food there), the tail moves away, to where? The tail was at (3,3), but head moves to (3,3), and no food eaten, so the tail should move to... in snake movement, when head moves to a new cell, and no food, the tail segment is removed, so the snake shortens? No.\n\nStandard snake: when head moves to a new cell:\n\n- If no food, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, so tail is removed from its position.\n\n- If food, head moves to new cell, new body segment added at the previous tail position, so tail stays, and snake grows.\n\nIn this case, after eating at (3,4), positions: [ (3,4), (3,3) ] with (3,4) head.\n\nIf I move down to (3,3), that cell has the tail. But when I move head to (3,3), since (3,3) has no food (food was eaten or not present), so no food eaten, so head moves to (3,3), and the tail is removed. But since the tail was at (3,3), and head moves to (3,3), it's the same cell. But at the start, before move, head at (3,4), tail at (3,3). After move: head moves to (3,3), which was tail position. Since no food, the tail should be removed, but it's being occupied by head now, so effectively, the snake now has only one segment at (3,3). Because the body segment is gone.\n\nLet's think: positions before move: index 0: head (3,4), index 1: tail (3,3)\n\nAfter moving down to (3,3): head moves to (3,3). Since (3,3) had no food (assuming no food there), so no growth, thus the tail segment is removed. But the tail segment was at (3,3), which is now head, so positions become: head at (3,3), and no body, so length 1.\n\nBut in terms of collision, moving to tail position is allowed and safe because the tail moves away simultaneously.\n\nIn this case, no problem.\n\nIf there was food at (3,3), but there isn't.\n\nBack to point.\n\nIf I eat at (3,4) on turn 0, I get +1, snake length 2.\n\nThen at turn 1, I can move U, L, R, or D but cannot reverse down since direction U? After moving up, direction is U, so for next move, I cannot move down (reverse).\n\nSo possible: U to (3,5), L to (2,4), R to (4,4), D not allowed.\n\nNow, other food: (5,2) at (5,2), (2,5) at (2,5).\n\n(2,5) is close, from (3,4), if I go L to (2,4), then U to (2,5), I can eat (2,5) on turn 2 if I go that way.\n\nSimilarly, (5,2) is farther.\n\nBut let's think long-term.\n\nI need to avoid risks. With length 2, the only risk is the tail, but since I can move to tail position safely, it's ok, but I need to be careful not to trap myself.\n\nAlso, walls and obstacles.\n\nInternal obstacle at (3,1), which is below.\n\nSince I have to think 5 turns ahead, I should simulate possible paths.\n\nFirst option: go up to (3,4) at turn 0, eat food.\n\nTurn 0: action U to (3,4), eat food, score +1, snake now [ (3,4), (3,3) ], direction U.\n\nTurn 1: from (3,4), direction U, possible moves: U to (3,5), L to (2,4), R to (4,4). Cannot D.\n\nNow, to reach (2,5), which is food at (2,5), I can go L to (2,4) first.\n\n(2,4) is empty, I think.\n\nThen from (2,4), I can go U to (2,5) to eat it.\n\n(2,5) has food, so if I go to (2,5) on turn 2, I eat it.\n\nSimilarly, from (3,4), I could go to other places.\n\nBut let's plan.\n\nTurn 1: move L to (2,4). No food there, so snake moves: head to (2,4), tail moves to... positions were [ (3,4), (3,3) ], head moves to (2,4), no food, so tail is removed from (3,3), and new positions: head at (2,4), tail at (3,4)? Standard movement: when head moves to new cell, body segments follow.\n\nAfter turn 0: segments: index 0: (3,4), index 1: (3,3)\n\nTurn 1: move head to (2,4). Since no food, the head moves to (2,4), and the body segment (index 1) moves to previous head position (3,4). So new positions: head (2,4), body (3,4). Since length 2, no other segments.\n\nThen direction is L.\n\nNow at (2,4), food at (2,5) is above, so I can go U to (2,5) to eat it.\n\nTurn 2: move U to (2,5). Eat food, so snake grows. New head at (2,5), and new tail added, so positions: head (2,5), body (2,4), and the previous body (3,4) becomes the tail? When eating, the tail doesn't move, a new segment is added at the tail position.\n\nAfter turn 1: positions [ (2,4), (3,4) ] with (2,4) head.\n\nMove U to (2,5): head moves to (2,5), and since food eaten, a new segment is added at the current tail position (3,4). So new positions: head (2,5), then body (2,4), then tail (3,4). So length 3.\n\nDirection U.\n\nNow, I have eaten two foods, score +2.\n\nBut I need to think further.\n\nOther food at (5,2), which is at (5,2).\n\nFrom (2,5), I need to go to (5,2), which is down-right.\n\nPossible moves: from (2,5), direction U, so can go U, L, R, not D reverse? Direction U, so cannot move D immediately.\n\nU to (2,6), L to (1,5), R to (3,5).\n\n(5,2) is at (5,2), so I need to move right and down.\n\nBut I have to avoid the body: positions head (2,5), body (2,4), tail (3,4).\n\nSo cells occupied: (2,5), (2,4), (3,4).\n\nMoving to (2,6) up: (2,6) is empty, should be fine.\n\n(1,5) left: x=1, y=5, should be within bounds, no wall.\n\n(3,5) right: (3,5) empty.\n\nBut to go to (5,2), I need to go right and down.\n\nFor example, go R to (3,5) on turn 3.\n\nThen from (3,5), direction R (since moved right), can go U, D, R, not L.\n\nThen D to (3,4), but (3,4) is the tail.\n\nAt turn 2, after eating at (2,5), positions: head (2,5), body (2,4), tail (3,4)\n\nTurn 3: move to (3,5)? From (2,5), if I move R to (3,5), that's right, so new head at (3,5), direction R.\n\nNo food at (3,5), so no growth, tail moves: head to (3,5), body (2,4) moves to previous head (2,5), and tail (3,4) moves to previous body (2,4)? Positions: let's list indices.\n\nAfter turn 2: segment 0: (2,5), seg1: (2,4), seg2: (3,4)\n\nMove head to (3,5): new position seg0: (3,5)\n\nThen seg1 moves to previous seg0 position (2,5)\n\nSeg2 moves to previous seg1 position (2,4)\n\nSo new positions: head (3,5), body (2,5), tail (2,4)\n\nNow, (3,4) is empty.\n\nNow, from (3,5), direction R, can move U to (3,6), D to (3,4), R to (4,5), L not allowed.\n\n(3,4) is now empty, so I can move D to (3,4).\n\nThen from there, I can go to (4,4), etc., towards (5,2).\n\n(5,2) is at (5,2), so from (3,4), go R to (4,4), then R to (5,4), then D to (5,3), D to (5,2), but (5,3) and (5,2) need to be checked.\n\nBut there might be risks with body or walls.\n\nSince I have time, I can go directly.\n\nBut let's not get ahead; I need to consider if I don't eat the first food.\n\nBack to turn 0 decision.\n\nIf I don't go up, I could go left or down.\n\nIf I go left to (2,3) at turn 0.\n\nCurrent position (3,3), direction L, move L to (2,3).\n\nNo food at (2,3), so snake remains length 1, head now at (2,3), direction L.\n\nThen, I can go to (2,5) which is food.\n\nFrom (2,3), move U to (2,4), then U to (2,5) to eat on turn 2.\n\nSimilarly, I could go down to (2,2), but no food there.\n\nIf I go down to (3,2) at turn 0.\n\n(3,2) is empty, no food, so head to (3,2), direction D.\n\nThen from there, I can go to (5,2) or other.\n\nBut (5,2) is at (5,2), from (3,2), I can go R to (4,2), then R to (5,2) to eat on turn 2 if I go that way.\n\nFrom (3,3), down to (3,2), turn 0.\n\nThen turn 1, from (3,2), direction D, can move L, R, D, not U reverse.\n\nL to (2,2), R to (4,2), D to (3,1) but (3,1) is obstacle! Internal obstacle at (3,1), so cannot go there.\n\nD to (3,1) is invalid, wall.\n\nSo from (3,2), possible moves: L to (2,2), R to (4,2), or U but U is reverse? Direction D, so cannot move U, only L, R, D but D to (3,1) wall, so only L or R.\n\nSay move R to (4,2), no food, head to (4,2), direction R.\n\nThen turn 2, move R to (5,2) to eat food at (5,2).\n\nSo eating on turn 2.\n\nCompared to if I go up first, I eat on turn 0, then another on turn 2.\n\nIf I go left first, eat on turn 2 at (2,5).\n\nBut if I eat immediately on turn 0, I get the point earlier, and I can plan for others.\n\nBut there is a risk with \"Tail Reward Danger\" but since initially no tail, it's fine.\n\nAfter eating, with body, I need to be careful.\n\nBut in this case, with only one body segment, it's manageable.\n\nNow, another thing: the food at (3,4) is very close, and if I don't eat it now, someone else might, but it's single player, so no, only me. So I can eat it later, but it has life span, but 10 turns, plenty.\n\nBut since it's positive and close, eating it early might be good to grow and have more flexibility.\n\nBut with longer snake, it might be harder to maneuver, but initially growing is good.\n\nPrioritize survival, but no immediate danger.\n\nLet's list all food: (3,4), (5,2), (2,5). All +1.\n\nI should consider the grid layout.\n\nGrid: 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7). Walls: borders, so I can't go to x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7? Border cells are walls, so for example, x=0 is wall, so I can't go to x=0.\n\nSimilarly, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls.\n\nAlso internal obstacle at (3,1).\n\nNow, snake at (3,3).\n\nFood at (3,4) - above, (5,2) - down-right, (2,5) - up-left.\n\nIf I go to (3,4) now, I eat it, and I'm at (3,4) with body at (3,3).\n\nThen I can go to (2,5) as I thought.\n\n(2,5) is at (2,5), which is near the corner? x=2, y=5.\n\nFrom (3,4) to (2,4) to (2,5).\n\n(2,5) is not border, x=2>0, y=5<7, so ok.\n\nThen after eating (2,5), I'm at (2,5) with body segments.\n\nThen I need to go to (5,2).\n\n(5,2) is at (5,2), which is bottom-right.\n\nFrom (2,5) to (5,2), I can go right and down.\n\nBut there is obstacle at (3,1), which might be in the way if I go low.\n\n(3,1) is below, so if I stay high, it might be fine.\n\nFor example, from (2,5), go to (3,5), then (4,5), (5,5), then down to (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), but (5,2) is at y=2, so from (5,5) to (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), that's three moves down.\n\nBut I have to avoid walls.\n\ny=0 is wall, but y=2 is fine.\n\nSimilarly, borders are walls, but (5,2) is not border, x=5<7, y=2>0.\n\nNow, with snake length, when I move, I need to not collide with body.\n\nBut if I plan carefully, it should be ok.\n\nIf I don't eat the first food, I can go directly to (2,5) or (5,2).\n\nFor example, if I go left to (2,3) at turn 0, then up to (2,4), then to (2,5) on turn 2, eat.\n\nSimilarly, for (5,2), go down to (3,2) at turn 0, but (3,2) no food, then right to (4,2) turn 1, then to (5,2) turn 2 eat.\n\nBut in both cases, I eat on turn 2, whereas if I eat (3,4) on turn 0, I have +1 earlier.\n\nAlso, after eating (3,4), I have a body, which might block some paths, but initially, it's not bad.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (3,4) might be under the snake if I grow, but since I eat it when head moves there, it's fine.\n\nBut in this case, at turn 0, snake is only at (3,3), so (3,4) is free.\n\nI think eating (3,4) on turn 0 is a good immediate reward, and I can then go for (2,5).\n\nThen for (5,2), it might take more turns.\n\nBut let's estimate turns.\n\nIf I eat (3,4) on turn 0:\n\n- Turn 0: U to (3,4), eat, snake length 2, positions (3,4) head, (3,3) tail\n\n- Turn 1: L to (2,4), no eat, positions: head (2,4), body (3,4)? After move: head to (2,4), tail moves to previous head (3,4)? Earlier: positions before move: [ (3,4), (3,3) ]\n\nMove head to (2,4): no food, so head at (2,4), and the body segment moves to previous head position (3,4). Since only one body, tail was at (3,3), but when head moves, the segment that was at (3,3) moves to where the head was, but it's a chain.\n\nStandard: the segment behind moves to the position of the segment ahead.\n\nSo seg1 (tail) was at (3,3), it moves to where seg0 was, which is (3,4). So new seg1 at (3,4).\n\nHead at (2,4). So positions: (2,4), (3,4)\n\n- Turn 2: U to (2,5), eat food at (2,5), so head to (2,5), new segment added at current tail position (3,4), so positions: head (2,5), body (2,4), tail (3,4)\n\nNow, to go to (5,2):\n\nFrom (2,5), I can go R to (3,5) on turn 3.\n\nTurn 3: move R to (3,5), no food, positions: head (3,5), body (2,5) moved from (2,4)? Positions before: seg0 (2,5), seg1 (2,4), seg2 (3,4)\n\nMove head to (3,5): new seg0 (3,5)\n\nSeg1 moves to previous seg0 (2,5)\n\nSeg2 moves to previous seg1 (2,4)\n\nSo positions: head (3,5), body (2,5), tail (2,4)\n\nNow from (3,5), direction R, can move R to (4,5), U to (3,6), D to (3,4), etc.\n\n(3,4) is now empty.\n\nMove R to (4,5) turn 4.\n\nTurn 4: R to (4,5), no food, positions: head (4,5), body (3,5), tail (2,5)? Before move: seg0 (3,5), seg1 (2,5), seg2 (2,4)\n\nMove head to (4,5): new seg0 (4,5)\n\nSeg1 moves to (3,5)\n\nSeg2 moves to (2,5)\n\nPositions: head (4,5), body (3,5), tail (2,5)\n\nThen turn 5: move R to (5,5), no food, positions: head (5,5), body (4,5), tail (3,5)\n\nThen from (5,5), I need to go down to (5,4), (5,3), (5,2).\n\nBut (5,2) has food.\n\nTurn 6: move D to (5,4), no food, positions: head (5,4), body (5,5), tail (4,5)\n\nDirection D.\n\nTurn 7: move D to (5,3), no food, positions: head (5,3), body (5,4), tail (5,5)\n\nTurn 8: move D to (5,2), eat food, head to (5,2), new segment added, positions: head (5,2), body (5,3), tail (5,4), and new tail? After eating, new segment at previous tail position.\n\nBefore move: seg0 (5,3)? Let's list.\n\nBefore turn 8: positions from turn 7: head (5,3), body (5,4), tail (5,5)\n\nMove head to (5,2): eat food, so head at (5,2), new segment added at current tail position (5,5), so positions: head (5,2), then body (5,3), then body (5,4), then tail (5,5)? Segments: seg0 head (5,2), seg1 (5,3), seg2 (5,4), seg3 tail (5,5)\n\nBut (5,5) is tail.\n\nNow, I have eaten all three foods by turn 8.\n\nBut I need to think only 5 turns ahead for now, but I have to provide actions for multiple turns.\n\nIn the answer, I need to output actions for turn 0,1,2,... probably at least 5.\n\nBut for turn 0, I need to decide.\n\nIf I don't eat (3,4) first, I can go directly to (2,5) or (5,2).\n\nFor example, go left to (2,3) at turn 0.\n\nTurn 0: L to (2,3), no eat, head at (2,3), direction L.\n\nTurn 1: U to (2,4), no eat, head at (2,4), body at (2,3)? After turn 0: head at (2,3), no body.\n\nTurn 0 move: from (3,3) to (2,3), no eat, so head at (2,3), no body.\n\nThen turn 1: move U to (2,4), no food at (2,4)? Food is at (2,5), not (2,4), so no eat, head to (2,4), still no body.\n\nThen turn 2: U to (2,5), eat food, head at (2,5), tail added at (2,4)? After move: since ate, new segment at previous position, so head at (2,5), tail at (2,4).\n\nSimilarly, I can then go to (3,4) or (5,2).\n\n(3,4) is at (3,4), from (2,5), I can go R to (3,5) or D to (2,4) but (2,4) is tail, but can move there.\n\nGo R to (3,5) first.\n\nBut (3,4) is below (3,5).\n\nFrom (2,5), direction U, move R to (3,5) turn 3, no eat, positions head (3,5), body (2,5)\n\nThen turn 4, move D to (3,4), but (3,4) has food, so eat, positions head (3,4), body (3,5), tail added at (2,5)? Before move: head (3,5), body (2,5)\n\nMove to (3,4): eat, so head to (3,4), new segment at tail position (2,5), so positions: head (3,4), body (3,5), tail (2,5)\n\nThen go to (5,2) similarly.\n\nBut it takes more turns to eat the first food.\n\nIn first approach, I eat on turn 0 and turn 2.\n\nIn this, I eat on turn 2 and turn 4.\n\nSo better to eat close food first.\n\n(5,2) is also an option, but from (3,3), going to (5,2) directly: turn 0 down to (3,2), then turn 1 right to (4,2), turn 2 right to (5,2) eat.\n\nOn turn 2, eat (5,2), then I can go to (2,5) or (3,4).\n\nBut (3,4) is above, (2,5) left-up.\n\nFrom (5,2), to (2,5) is farther.\n\nSo eating (3,4) first seems efficient.\n\nMoreover, if I don't eat (3,4) now, and go elsewhere, the food might expire, but life span 10, so I have time, but why delay.\n\nAnother risk: if I go to (2,5) first, from (3,3) left to (2,3), then up to (2,4), then to (2,5), but on the way, (2,4) might be fine, but no issue.\n\nBut with internal obstacle at (3,1), it doesn't affect this path.\n\nI think going up to eat (3,4) on turn 0 is good.\n\nThen, for the next moves, I can go towards (2,5).\n\nIn the answer, I need to provide actions for several turns.\n\nAlso, since I think 5+ turns ahead, I should plan a sequence.\n\nBut for turn 0, action U.\n\nThen turn 1, from (3,4), I can go L to (2,4) to approach (2,5).\n\nThen turn 2, U to (2,5) to eat.\n\nThen for turn 3, from (2,5), I need to go towards (5,2).\n\nAs before, I can go R to (3,5).\n\nThen turn 4, R to (4,5), turn 5 R to (5,5), etc.\n\nBut to reach (5,2), I need to go down.\n\nFrom (5,5), down to (5,4), (5,3), (5,2).\n\nBut that might be beyond 5 turns.\n\nFor the answer, I need to output up to turn 5 or so.\n\nCurrent turn t1=0, so actions for turn 0,1,2,3,4,5.\n\nAfter turn 2, I'm at (2,5) with body.\n\nThen turn 3, move to (3,5)\n\nTurn 4, move to (4,5)\n\nTurn 5, move to (5,5)\n\nThen later to (5,4), etc.\n\nBut at turn 5, I'm at (5,5), not eating yet.\n\nI could go directly down earlier.\n\nFor example, from (2,5) after eating, instead of going right, I could go down, but from (2,5), direction U, cannot go down immediately, only U, L, R.\n\nU to (2,6), L to (1,5), R to (3,5).\n\n(2,6) is closer to border, y=6, border y=7, so not bad.\n\nBut (5,2) is low, so going down might be better, but I can't go down directly.\n\nI have to go sideways first.\n\nFrom (2,5) to (3,5), then from (3,5) I can go down to (3,4), but (3,4) might be occupied or not.\n\nIn the first sequence, after eating (2,5), positions at (2,5), (2,4), (3,4)\n\nThen from (2,5), go R to (3,5), positions head (3,5), body (2,5), tail (2,4)\n\nThen from (3,5), I can go D to (3,4), but (3,4) is where tail was, but now empty? In positions, tail is at (2,4), so (3,4) is empty.\n\nMove D to (3,4) on turn 3? Turn 3 from (3,5) to (3,4).\n\nDirection after move R to (3,5) is R, so from (3,5) direction R, can move D to (3,4).\n\n(3,4) has food? Food at (3,4) was eaten on turn 0, so no, it's gone.\n\nFood eaten disappears.\n\nSo (3,4) empty.\n\nMove D to (3,4), no eat, positions head (3,4), body (3,5), tail (2,5)? Before move: head (3,5), body (2,5), tail (2,4)\n\nMove head to (3,4): no food, so head (3,4), body moves to (3,5), tail moves to (2,5)\n\nPositions: head (3,4), body (3,5), tail (2,5)\n\nThen from (3,4), direction D, can move L to (2,4), R to (4,4), D to (3,3) or U but U reverse not allowed.\n\nD to (3,3) might be ok, but (3,3) could be something.\n\nGo R to (4,4) towards (5,2).\n\nTurn 4: R to (4,4), etc.\n\nBut it's similar.\n\nI think for now, eating (3,4) and then (2,5) is fine.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to provide actions.\n\nBut the \"Tail Reward Danger\" might be an issue later, but not now.\n\nAnother thing: food can spawn under body, but in this case, no.\n\nI think for turn 0, action U.\n\nThen turn 1, action L to (2,4)\n\nTurn 2, action U to (2,5) eat\n\nThen turn 3, action R to (3,5)\n\nTurn 4, action R to (4,5)\n\nTurn 5, action R to (5,5)\n\nThen I can continue to go down.\n\nBut at turn 5, I'm at (5,5), and (5,2) is below, I can go down on turn 6.\n\nBut for the answer, since it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", I need to provide actions for 5 turns or more.\n\nThe format is to list actions from turn t1=0 onwards.\n\nProbably for 5 steps.\n\nSince after turn 2 I have a body, I need to be careful not to hit it.\n\nIn this sequence, no problem.\n\nIf I go to (5,2) first, but it's farther, and (3,4) is very close.\n\nDistance: from (3,3) to (3,4) is 1 step, to (2,5) is |dx|+|dy| =1+2=3 steps, to (5,2) is 2+1=3 steps.\n\nSo (3,4) is closest.\n\nEat it first.\n\nThen (2,5) and (5,2) are both 3 steps from (3,4), but (2,5) is left-up, (5,2) is right-down.\n\nFrom (3,4), to (2,5) is |3-2| + |4-5| =1+1=2 steps: L then U or U then L, but in grid, Manhattan distance.\n\nSimilarly to (5,2) from (3,4) is |5-3| + |2-4| =2+2=4 steps.\n\nSo (2,5) is closer from (3,4).\n\nThus, after eating (3,4), go to (2,5) next.\n\nThen to (5,2).\n\nNow for the actions:\n\nTurn 0: U (to (3,4), eat food\n\nThen turn 1: since direction U, and I want to go left, so L to (2,4)\n\nAt turn 1, from (3,4), I could go U to (3,5) or L or R, but L to (2,4) is towards (2,5).\n\n(2,4) to (2,5) is up, so from (2,4), I need to go U.\n\nAfter moving L to (2,4), direction L.\n\nThen turn 2, move U to (2,5), which is not reverse? Current direction L, moving U is not opposite, so ok.\n\nOpposite of L is R, U is perpendicular.\n\nSo fine.\n\nThen after moving U to (2,5), direction U.\n\nThen turn 3, move R to (3,5), not reverse.\n\nDirection U, moving R is ok.\n\nThen turn 4, from (3,5), direction R (since moved R), move R to (4,5)\n\nThen turn 5, from (4,5), direction R, move R to (5,5)\n\nNow at turn 5, position (5,5), and (5,2) is below, so I can go down next turns.\n\nBut for the answer, I need to output up to turn 5.\n\nSince I have to think ahead, but output the sequence.\n\nNow, is there any risk? For example, when I move to (2,4) on turn 1, no issue.\n\nAt turn 2, to (2,5), eat.\n\nThen at turn 3, to (3,5), fine.\n\nBut (3,5) might be near, but no walls.\n\ny=5, x=3, not border.\n\nInternal obstacle at (3,1), not relevant.\n\nAlso, borders: x=0,7 walls, y=0,7 walls.\n\n(5,5) is x=5,y=5, not border.\n\nNow, after turn 5, to eat (5,2), I need to go down, but from (5,5), direction R, I can move D to (5,4), etc., but that's later.\n\nI think this is a safe plan.\n\nIf I want to go to (5,2) earlier, but from start, it takes at least 3 turns to eat, same as (2,5), but (3,4) is faster.\n\nSo I think U on turn 0 is best.\n\nNow, for the answer format:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 0: U\nTurn 1: L\nTurn 2: U\nTurn 3: R\nTurn 4: R\nTurn 5: R\n}\n\nBut turn 3,4,5 all R to (4,5), (5,5), which is fine, but I could vary.\n\nBut in this case, it's straightforward.\n\nSince I need to maximize score, and I eat two foods by turn 2, and the third by turn 8 or so, it's good.\n\nBut for the sequence, I think it's ok.\n\nPerhaps I should include more turns to show I think ahead.\n\nBut the format says \"Turn t1: action ...\" for multiple turns.\n\nProbably 5 turns are sufficient.\n\nNow, to confirm the actions:\n\n- Turn 0: U to (3,4) - eat positive food, score +1, snake length 2, positions [(3,4), (3,3)], direction U\n\n- Turn 1: L to (2,4) - no food, positions [(2,4), (3,4)], direction L (since moved left)\n\n- Turn 2: U to (2,5) - eat food at (2,5), positions [(2,5), (2,4), (3,4)]? After eating: head to (2,5), new segment at tail position (3,4), so positions: head (2,5), body (2,4), tail (3,4), direction U\n\n- Turn 3: R to (3,5) - no food, positions: head (3,5), body (2,5), tail (2,4) (since body moves), direction R\n\n- Turn 4: R to (4,5) - no food, positions: head (4,5), body (3,5), tail (2,5), direction R\n\n- Turn 5: R to (5,5) - no food, positions: head (5,5), body (4,5), tail (3,5), direction R\n\nAll safe, no collisions.\n\nThen I can continue to (5,4), (5,3), (5,2) to eat.\n\nBut for now, this should be fine.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while prioritizing long-term survival, I have planned a sequence of moves for at least 5 turns ahead. The strategy is to eat the positive food at (3,4) immediately on turn 0, as it is the closest and provides an early score increase with minimal risk. This also allows the snake to grow, which can be beneficial for future flexibility. After that, I prioritize eating the food at (2,5) on turn 2, as it is the next closest and avoids the internal obstacle at (3,1). Finally, I head towards the food at (5,2) by moving right across the top of the grid, ensuring no collisions with walls, obstacles, or the snake's body.\n\n### Key Considerations:\n- **Initial State**: Snake is at [(3,3)] (length 1), direction Left. Walls include borders (x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7) and internal obstacle at (3,1). Food: (3,4,1,10), (5,2,1,10), (2,5,1,10).\n- **Turn 0 (t=0)**: Move Up (U) to (3,4) to eat the positive food (+1 score, snake grows to length 2). No immediate risks as no body exists yet.\n- **Turn 1 (t=1)**: From (3,4) with direction Up, move Left (L) to (2,4) to approach (2,5). No food eaten, so snake moves and tail follows. Direction changes to Left.\n- **Turn 2 (t=2)**: From (2,4) with direction Left, move Up (U) to (2,5) to eat the positive food (+1 score, snake grows to length 3). Direction changes to Up.\n- **Turn 3 (t=3)**: From (2,5) with direction Up, move Right (R) to (3,5) to begin heading towards (5,2). No food, so snake moves safely. Direction changes to Right.\n- **Turn 4 (t=4)**: From (3,5) with direction Right, move Right (R) to (4,5). No food, but progress towards (5,2). Direction remains Right.\n- **Turn 5 (t=5)**: From (4,5) with direction Right, move Right (R) to (5,5). Positions now [(5,5), (4,5), (3,5)]. No food, but sets up for descent to (5,2) in future turns.\n\n### Why this sequence?\n- **Score Maximization**: Eats two foods by turn 2 (score +2), with a clear path to the third food (5,2) by approximately turn 8. This is efficient given the distances.\n- **Risk Avoidance**: \n  - No wall or obstacle collisions: Path avoids x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 and (3,1).\n  - No body collisions: Moving to the tail position (e.g., on turn 1 to (2,4) when tail is at (3,4)) is safe because the tail moves away. With the snake's length growing, movements are planned to keep the body segments trailing without overlap.\n  - \"Tail Reward Danger\" is irrelevant until the snake is longer, but this sequence avoids it by not targeting food adjacent to the tail.\n- **Long-Term Survival (5+ turns)**: \n  - By turn 5, the snake is at (5,5) with a clear, open path down to (5,2) (e.g., D to (5,4) on turn 6, D to (5,3) on turn 7, D to (5,2) on turn 8 for +1 score). \n  - The grid has ample space to maneuver after eating (5,2), and all food has sufficient life span (10 turns) to be eaten safely.\n- **Efficiency**: Prioritizing (3,4) and (2,5) first minimizes travel time compared to other paths (e.g., going to (5,2) first would delay the first eat until turn 2 and risk missing closer foods).\n\n### Action Sequence\nThe planned moves for turns 0 to 5 are:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 0: U\nTurn 1: L\nTurn 2: U\nTurn 3: R\nTurn 4: R\nTurn 5: R\n}",
