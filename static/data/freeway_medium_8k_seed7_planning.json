We start at y=0 and want to reach y=9.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if the player is on a freeway y (which must be between 1 and 8) and at that turn T, the player's x-coordinate is 0 and lies within the span of any car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nImportant note: When the player moves from y_T to y_{T+1} at turn T, they are considered to be on y_T at turn T (and hence check for collision on freeway y_T) and then move to y_{T+1} for the next turn. So at the next turn (T+1), they will be on freeway y_{T+1} (if between 1 and 8) and check for collision there.\n\nWe are given the car states at turn t1=2.\n\nWe need to compute the car positions at future turns. The formula:\n\nFor a car at turn t1 (which is 2) with head h, tail tau, direction d, speed s:\n\n- If left-moving: the car moves left, so the span at turn T (>= t1) is [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\n- If right-moving: the car moves right, so the span at turn T is [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut note: the table gives the cars at t1=2.\n\nLooking at the car data:\n\nFreeway 1: \n  (48, 37, right, 6) -> at t1=2: head=48, tail=37? But note the representation: for right-moving, the head is the front (so larger x) and tail is the back (smaller x). However, the update for right-moving: \n      Span(T) = [tau + s*(T-2), h + s*(T-2)]\n  But wait: the table says (head, tail, direction, speed). So for right-moving, the head should be the front (so at the right) and tail at the left? Then the span at time T would be [tail + s*(T-2), head + s*(T-2)].\n\nSimilarly, for the first car on freeway 1: (48,37,right,6) -> so at T=2: the car spans from 37 to 48? Actually, the representation says: for right-moving, the head is the front (so 48) and tail is the back (37). So at time T, the car will be at [37 + 6*(T-2), 48 + 6*(T-2)].\n\nBut note: the second car on freeway 1: (12,1,right,6) -> at T=2: from 1 to 12, then at T: [1+6*(T-2), 12+6*(T-2)].\n\nAnd the third: (-24,-35,right,6) -> at T: [-35+6*(T-2), -24+6*(T-2)].\n\nFreeway 2: only one car: (-48,-83,right,36) -> so at T: [-83+36*(T-2), -48+36*(T-2)].\n\nFreeways 3 to 8: each has two cars: \n  (-48,-59,right,6) -> at T: [-59+6*(T-2), -48+6*(T-2)]\n  (0,-11,right,6) -> at T: [-11+6*(T-2), 0+6*(T-2)] = [6*(T-2)-11, 6*(T-2)]\n\nWe note that the player is at x=0 at every turn. So we must check at each turn T (from t1=2 onward) if the player is on a freeway y (i.e., y between 1 and 8) and if 0 lies in the span of any car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nThe player's y-position at turn T is determined by the actions we take.\n\nWe start at turn 2: y=0. We are not on any freeway (since freeways are y=1..8) so no collision at turn 2.\n\nWe need to plan a sequence of actions (U, D, S) to get from y=0 to y=9 in minimal H (number of turns, including the starting turn? But note: the sequence is from t=0 to H-1 relative to t1, meaning from turn t1 to turn t1+H-1. And we require that at turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9). So we start at turn t1 (which is 2) and then take H actions? Actually, the sequence has H actions: from t1 to t1+H-1? But note the index: the actions are for turns t1+t for t from 0 to H-1. So:\n\nAt turn t1 (t=0): we take action a_{t1} = a_2\nAt turn t1+1 (t=1): a_3\n...\nAt turn t1+H-1 (t=H-1): a_{t1+H-1}\n\nAnd the state after the last action (at turn t1+H-1) is y_{t1+H-1} = 9.\n\nWe must avoid collisions at every turn from t1 (turn 2) to t1+H-1 (the turn when we are at y=9). Note that at the turn when we are at y=9, we are on freeway? No, because freeways are 1 to 8. So when we are at y=9, we are safe (no car check). Similarly, when we are at y=0, we are safe.\n\nSo we only check for collisions when the player is at y in {1,2,...,8} at a given turn.\n\nWe are to minimize H.\n\nWe can model this as a state-space search: state = (turn, y) and we want to go from (2,0) to some (T,9) with minimal T (which is the turn number). The total turns H = T - t1 + 1? Actually, note: we start at turn 2 (t1=2) and we take H actions so we end at turn 2+H-1 = H+1. We require that at turn H+1 (if we start at turn 2 and take H actions) we are at 9? Actually, the last action is at turn t1+H-1 = 2+H-1 = H+1? That doesn't match. Let me clarify:\n\nThe actions are taken at turns: \n  t1 (turn 2): first action -> leads to state at turn 3? But note the update: \n      At turn t, we are at y_t. Then we choose a_t, and then y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t.\n\nSo at turn t1 (turn 2), we are at y=0. Then we choose a_2, and then at turn 3, we are at y_3 = y_2 + Delta y_2.\n\nTherefore, the state at the beginning of turn t is y_t. We take action a_t at turn t, and then we are at turn t+1 with y_{t+1}.\n\nWe require that at the beginning of turn t1+H, we are at y=9? But note: the sequence of actions is from turn t1 to turn t1+H-1, so H actions. Then the state after the last action is at turn t1+H. We require y_{t1+H} = 9.\n\nBut the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning for t from 0 to H-1: so a_{t1+0}, a_{t1+1}, ... a_{t1+H-1}. Then after taking these H actions, the player will be at y_{t1+H} = 9.\n\nSo we start at turn t1 (2) at y=0, then we take H actions (at turns 2,3,...,2+H-1) and then at turn 2+H, we are at y=9.\n\nTherefore, the total number of turns (including the starting turn) is H+1? But the problem asks for minimal H (the number of actions) and then we end at turn t1+H.\n\nWe must avoid collisions at every turn from 2 to 2+H-1? Actually, during the action execution: at each turn t (from t1 to t1+H-1), we are at y_t and then we choose an action. But the collision check at turn t: we are at y_t. So we must check for every turn t in [t1, t1+H-1] (i.e., from 2 to 2+H-1) that if y_t is in [1,8] then 0 must not be in the span of any car on freeway y_t at turn t.\n\nNote: at the final turn t1+H, we are at y=9 and we don't check because we are not on a freeway. And at the start turn t1 (turn 2) we are at y=0 (safe).\n\nSo we need to simulate from turn=2, y=0, and we take H actions and end at y=9 at turn=2+H, and we avoid collisions on turns 2,3,...,2+H-1.\n\nWe want minimal H.\n\nSince the grid is small (only 10 vertical positions) and time can be simulated until we reach the goal, we can do a BFS in state (turn, y) but note: turn can be large? However, the cars move at constant speeds and eventually the cars will leave the x=0 position? But we have cars that might cycle? Actually, the freeway is infinite? But the car positions are linear in time. We can compute for a given turn T and freeway k, whether there is a car at x=0.\n\nBut note: the problem asks for the minimal H. Since we can only move one step at a time (or stay) and we have to go from 0 to 9, the minimal H without any cars would be 9 (if we always go up). But with cars, we might have to wait (stay) or even go down to avoid collisions, so H might be larger.\n\nWe can try to compute the safe times for each freeway. For each freeway k (1 to 8) and for each turn T, we can compute if there is a car at x=0 on that freeway at turn T.\n\nWe note that the player's path is a sequence of y-positions: y2, y3, y4, ... up to y_{2+H}=9, and we require that for every turn t from 2 to 2+H-1, if y_t is in [1,8] then the freeway k=y_t must be safe at turn t.\n\nWe are going to simulate the car positions for the required freeways.\n\nLet's precompute for each freeway k and for each turn T (starting from 2) the safety: safe[k][T] = True if at turn T, there is no car on freeway k that covers x=0.\n\nWe have to compute for T from 2 until we find a path to y=9.\n\nBut note: we don't know H in advance, so we might have to compute until we find a solution.\n\nHowever, we can compute the car positions for each freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: \n  Cars: \n    car1: (48,37,right,6) -> at turn T: [37 + 6*(T-2), 48 + 6*(T-2)]\n    car2: (12,1,right,6) -> [1+6*(T-2), 12+6*(T-2)]\n    car3: (-24,-35,right,6) -> [-35+6*(T-2), -24+6*(T-2)]\n\n  We need to check if 0 is in any of these intervals at turn T.\n\n  For car1: 0 in [37+6*(T-2), 48+6*(T-2)]?\n      => 37+6*(T-2) <= 0 <= 48+6*(T-2)\n      => 6*(T-2) in [-48, -37] -> but 6*(T-2) is integer and -48 to -37: no integer T in this range? Actually, we can solve:\n\n      37 + 6*(T-2) <= 0 <= 48 + 6*(T-2)\n\n      Left: 6*(T-2) <= -37 -> T-2 <= -37/6 ~ -6.16 -> T <= -4.16 -> no T>=2 satisfies.\n\n  For car2: 1+6*(T-2) <= 0 <= 12+6*(T-2)\n      Left: 1+6*(T-2) <= 0 -> 6*(T-2) <= -1 -> T-2 <= -1/6 -> T <= 2 - 1/6 -> T<=1.83 -> no T>=2.\n\n  For car3: -35+6*(T-2) <= 0 <= -24+6*(T-2)\n      Left: -35+6*(T-2) <=0 -> 6*(T-2) <=35 -> T-2 <= 35/6 ~5.83 -> T<=7.83 -> so T from 2 to 7?\n      Right: 0 <= -24+6*(T-2) -> 24 <= 6*(T-2) -> T-2 >=4 -> T>=6.\n\n      So T=6 and 7.\n\n      At T=6: [ -35+6*(4)= -35+24=-11, -24+24=0 ] -> so [ -11, 0] -> 0 is included? Actually, the interval is [a,b] inclusive? The problem says \"span\", and collision if 0 in the span. So yes, at T=6: 0 is the right endpoint? -> included.\n\n      T=7: [ -35+6*5 = -35+30=-5, -24+30=6] -> 0 is in [-5,6] -> included.\n\n      So freeway 1 is unsafe at T=6 and T=7.\n\n  Therefore, for freeway 1: safe at all T except T=6,7.\n\nFreeway 2:\n  Car: (-48,-83,right,36) -> span at T: [-83+36*(T-2), -48+36*(T-2)]\n\n  Check: -83+36*(T-2) <= 0 <= -48+36*(T-2)\n\n  Left: -83+36*(T-2) <=0 -> 36*(T-2)<=83 -> T-2<=83/36≈2.305 -> T<=4.305 -> T=2,3,4.\n\n  Right: 0<=-48+36*(T-2) -> 48<=36*(T-2) -> T-2>=48/36≈1.33 -> T>=3.33 -> so T>=4? But T must be integer: T>=4.\n\n  So for T=4: \n      left: -83+36*(2) = -83+72 = -11\n      right: -48+72=24\n      0 in [-11,24] -> unsafe.\n\n  T=3: \n      left: -83+36*(1) = -47\n      right: -48+36= -12\n      Then 0 is not in [-47, -12] -> safe.\n\n  T=2: \n      left: -83+0=-83, right=-48 -> 0 not in [-83,-48] -> safe.\n\n  T=5: \n      left: -83+36*3 = -83+108=25 -> then 0<25 -> not in [25, ...] -> safe? \n      Actually, the interval at T=5: [ -83+36*3, -48+36*3] = [25, 60] -> 0 not in.\n\n  So only T=4 is unsafe for freeway2.\n\nFreeway 3 to 8: each has two cars:\n\n  carA: (-48,-59,right,6) -> span: [-59+6*(T-2), -48+6*(T-2)]\n  carB: (0,-11,right,6) -> span: [-11+6*(T-2), 0+6*(T-2)] = [6*(T-2)-11, 6*(T-2)]\n\n  Check carA: \n      -59+6*(T-2) <= 0 <= -48+6*(T-2)\n      Left: -59+6*(T-2)<=0 -> 6*(T-2)<=59 -> T-2<=59/6≈9.83 -> T<=11.83 -> T=2 to 11.\n      Right: 0<=-48+6*(T-2) -> 48<=6*(T-2) -> T-2>=8 -> T>=10.\n\n      So T=10,11: unsafe.\n\n      For T=10: [ -59+6*8 = -59+48=-11, -48+48=0] -> 0 in [-11,0] -> unsafe.\n      T=11: [ -59+6*9=-59+54=-5, -48+54=6] -> 0 in [-5,6] -> unsafe.\n\n  Check carB:\n      [6*(T-2)-11, 6*(T-2)]\n      We need: 6*(T-2)-11 <= 0 <= 6*(T-2)\n      Right: 0<=6*(T-2) -> T-2>=0 -> T>=2 (always true for our T>=2)\n      Left: 6*(T-2)-11<=0 -> 6*(T-2)<=11 -> T-2<=11/6≈1.83 -> T<=3.83 -> T=2,3.\n\n      So T=2: [6*0-11, 0] = [-11,0] -> 0 in the interval? The interval is closed? yes -> unsafe at T=2? \n          But note: at T=2, the car is at [-11,0]. So 0 is the right endpoint -> included.\n\n      T=3: [6*1-11,6] = [-5,6] -> 0 in? yes.\n\n      T=4: [6*2-11,12] = [1,12] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\n      So carB is unsafe at T=2 and T=3.\n\n  Therefore, for freeway k (3 to 8): \n      Unsafe at T=2 (from carB), T=3 (from carB), T=10 (from carA), T=11 (from carA).\n\n  So for freeways 3-8: unsafe at T=2,3,10,11.\n\nNow, we summarize the unsafe freeways by turn:\n\nTurn T | Unsafe freeways (k)\nT=2: freeways 3-8 (because of carB) -> k in {3,4,5,6,7,8}\nT=3: freeways 3-8 (carB) -> k in {3,4,5,6,7,8}\nT=4: freeway 2 (only) and freeways 3-8 are safe? But wait: at T=4, freeway2 is unsafe, and freeways 3-8: \n      For freeways 3-8: at T=4, carA: [ -59+6*2 = -59+12=-47, -48+12=-36] -> 0 not in.\n               carB: [6*2-11=1, 12] -> 0 not in -> so safe.\n      So only freeway2 is unsafe at T=4.\n\nT=5: freeways 3-8: safe? \n      carA: [-59+18=-41, -48+18=-30] -> safe\n      carB: [6*3-11=7, 18] -> safe.\n      freeway2: safe (as we saw at T=5 the car is at [25,60] -> safe).\n      freeway1: safe (only unsafe at 6,7).\n      So no unsafe freeway? Actually, we have to check freeway1 and freeway2? But freeway1 is safe at T=5? yes.\n\nT=6: freeway1 unsafe, and freeways 3-8: safe? \n      For freeways 3-8: carA: [-59+24=-35, -48+24=-24] -> safe (0 not in)\n               carB: [6*4-11=13,24] -> safe.\n      freeway2: safe (as we saw at T=6: [ -83+36*4 = -83+144=61, -48+144=96] -> safe? yes, 0 not in [61,96])\n      So only freeway1 unsafe at T=6.\n\nT=7: freeway1 unsafe, freeways 3-8: \n      carA: [-59+30=-29, -48+30=-18] -> safe\n      carB: [6*5-11=19,30] -> safe.\n      freeway2: safe? at T=7: [ -83+36*5= -83+180=97, ...] -> safe.\n      So only freeway1 unsafe at T=7.\n\nT=8: \n      freeway1: safe? \n          car1: [37+6*6=37+36=73, 48+36=84] -> safe\n          car2: [1+36=37,12+36=48] -> safe\n          car3: [-35+36=1, -24+36=12] -> 0 not in [1,12] -> safe.\n      freeway2: safe.\n      freeways3-8: \n          carA: [-59+6*6=-59+36=-23, -48+36=-12] -> safe\n          carB: [6*6-11=25,36] -> safe.\n\nT=9: \n      freeway1: safe (car3: [ -35+6*7 = -35+42=7, -24+42=18] -> safe)\n      freeway2: safe.\n      freeways3-8: \n          carA: [-59+42=-17, -48+42=-6] -> safe? 0 not in [-17,-6] -> safe\n          carB: [6*7-11=31,42] -> safe.\n\nT=10: \n      freeway1: safe? \n          car3: [ -35+6*8=13, -24+48=24] -> safe.\n      freeway2: safe? \n          at T=10: [ -83+36*8 = -83+288=205, -48+288=240] -> safe.\n      freeways3-8: unsafe (carA: at T=10: [-59+6*8=-59+48=-11, -48+48=0] -> 0 in the interval? yes) -> unsafe for k=3..8.\n\nT=11: \n      freeway1: safe? \n          car3: [ -35+6*9=19, -24+54=30] -> safe.\n      freeway2: safe.\n      freeways3-8: unsafe (carA: [-59+54=-5, -48+54=6] -> 0 in [-5,6] -> unsafe)\n\nT=12: \n      freeway1: safe.\n      freeway2: safe.\n      freeways3-8: \n          carA: [-59+60=1, -48+60=12] -> 0 not in [1,12] -> safe.\n          carB: [6*10-11=49,60] -> safe.\n\nSo the unsafe freeways by turn:\n\nT=2: freeways 3,4,5,6,7,8\nT=3: freeways 3,4,5,6,7,8\nT=4: freeway 2\nT=6: freeway 1\nT=7: freeway 1\nT=10: freeways 3,4,5,6,7,8\nT=11: freeways 3,4,5,6,7,8\n\nNow, we plan a path from y=0 at turn 2 to y=9 at turn 2+H, with actions taken at turns 2,3,...,2+H-1 (H actions) and we avoid being on an unsafe freeway at each turn t (from 2 to 2+H-1).\n\nWe start at turn 2: y=0 (safe, because y=0 is not a freeway).\n\nWe can move: U (to y=1), D (invalid because y=0 -> y would become -1 -> not allowed, so D is invalid at y=0), or S (stay at y=0). So at turn 2, we can only do U or S.\n\nBut note: if we do S at turn 2, then at turn 3 we are still at y=0. Then we can do U at turn 3? But we are at turn 3: we are at y=0? Then again safe. But we need to eventually go up.\n\nWe want minimal H. The minimal H without obstacles is 9 (if we go up 9 times). But we have to avoid unsafe freeways at the turns we are on them.\n\nLet me try to go up as fast as possible:\n\nWe are at turn 2: y=0 -> action U -> at turn 3: y=1.\n\nAt turn 3: we are at y=1. But at turn 3, freeway1 is safe? According to our table, at T=3, unsafe freeways are only 3-8. So freeway1 is safe. Then we can do U again: at turn 4: y=2.\n\nAt turn 4: we are at y=2. At T=4, freeway2 is unsafe. So we cannot be on freeway2 (y=2) at turn 4? -> collision.\n\nSo we must avoid being at y=2 at turn 4.\n\nTherefore, at turn 3 (when we are at y=1) we cannot go to y=2 at turn 4? Actually, the collision check is at the turn we are at a freeway. At turn 3 we are at y=1 (freeway1) and it is safe. Then we choose an action at turn 3: if we choose U, then at turn 4 we will be at y=2. But at turn 4, we are at y=2 (freeway2) and at turn 4 freeway2 is unsafe -> collision.\n\nSo we must not choose U at turn 3? Then what? We can choose S or D.\n\nIf we choose D at turn 3: then at turn 4 we go to y=0. But then we are at y=0 (safe) but we have lost progress.\n\nIf we choose S: then at turn 4 we are at y=1. But at turn 4, freeway1 is safe? Yes, because unsafe freeways at T=4: only freeway2. So we can stay at y=1 at turn 4.\n\nThen at turn 4: we are at y=1 (freeway1) and it's safe. Then we can choose an action at turn 4: we want to go up eventually.\n\nBut if we choose U at turn 4: then at turn 5 we go to y=2. Now at turn 5: we are at y=2 (freeway2). And at T=5, freeway2 is safe? Yes, because unsafe freeways at T=5: none. So that's safe.\n\nThen we can continue:\n\nTurn 5: at y=2 -> we can do U to y=3 at turn 6.\n\nAt turn 6: we are at y=3 (freeway3). But at T=6, unsafe freeways: only freeway1. So freeway3 is safe? Yes. Then we can do U: to y=4 at turn 7.\n\nAt turn 7: y=4 -> freeway4. At T=7, unsafe: freeway1 -> safe for freeway4. Then U to y=5 at turn 8.\n\nTurn 8: y=5 -> safe? T=8: no unsafe freeway. Then U to y=6 at turn 9.\n\nTurn 9: y=6 -> safe? T=9: no unsafe. Then U to y=7 at turn 10.\n\nNow, at turn 10: we are at y=7 (freeway7). But at T=10, freeways 3-8 are unsafe! So collision.\n\nSo we must avoid being at any freeway 3-8 at turn 10.\n\nTherefore, we cannot be at y in {3,4,5,6,7,8} at turn 10.\n\nWe are at turn 9: at y=6. We want to avoid being at freeway 3-8 at turn 10. So at turn 9, if we are at y=6, we cannot go up to 7 (which would be at turn 10) because then we are at freeway7 at turn 10 -> unsafe.\n\nWe could stay at y=6 at turn 9? Then at turn 10 we are at y=6 -> freeway6 -> unsafe.\n\nOr go down to y=5 at turn 10? Then at turn 10 we are at freeway5 -> unsafe.\n\nSo we must be at a safe freeway at turn 10: but the only safe freeways at turn 10 are freeway1 and freeway2? But we are at y=6 at turn 9, so we cannot get to freeway1 or 2 in one move? We can only move to y=5,6,7 at turn 10.\n\nBut freeway1 is y=1, freeway2 is y=2. So we cannot reach them from y=6 in one move.\n\nTherefore, we must avoid being at freeway 3-8 at turn 10 and 11. How?\n\nWe need to be at y=0,1,2, or 9 at turn 10 and 11? But note: we are trying to get to 9, so if we can get to 9 at turn 10, that would be safe (because y=9 is not a freeway). Similarly, if we are at y=0 or 1 or 2 at turn 10, then:\n\n- y=0: safe\n- y=1: freeway1 -> at T=10: freeway1 is safe? Yes, because unsafe freeways at T=10 are only 3-8. So freeway1 is safe.\n- y=2: freeway2 -> at T=10: freeway2 is safe? Yes.\n\nSo we can be at y=0,1,2, or 9 at turn 10.\n\nSimilarly at turn 11: we can be at y=0,1,2,9.\n\nSo we need to adjust the path so that at turn 10 we are not at y>=3.\n\nWe are at turn 9 at y=6. How can we get to y<=2 at turn 10? We have to move down 4 steps? But we can only move down one step per turn. So from y=6 at turn 9, we can only get to y=5,6,7 at turn 10.\n\nTherefore, we must not be at y=6 at turn 9? Then we have to plan an alternative.\n\nWe must be at a lower y at turn 9 so that we can get to y<=2 at turn 10? Or we can wait at a safe place until after turn 11.\n\nLet me backtrack and try a different route.\n\nWe know that we have to avoid being at freeway2 at turn4 and freeway1 at turn6,7 and freeways3-8 at turn10,11.\n\nWe start:\n\nTurn2: y=0 -> we can do U to y=1 at turn3, or S to stay at y=0 at turn3.\n\nOption 1: U at turn2 -> y=1 at turn3.\n\nAt turn3: y=1 -> safe (freeway1 is safe at T=3). Now we cannot go to y=2 at turn4 (because unsafe). So we must do S or D.\n\nIf we do S: then at turn4: y=1 -> safe (freeway1 safe at T=4). Then at turn4: we are at y=1. Then we can do U to y=2 at turn5 -> safe (freeway2 safe at T=5). Then:\n\nTurn5: y=2 -> safe. Then we can go up: \n  turn5: U -> turn6: y=3 -> but at turn6: freeway3 -> safe? At T=6, unsafe freeways: only freeway1 -> so freeway3 is safe? Yes. Then we can proceed.\n\nBut then we have to avoid turn10 and turn11 at freeways3-8.\n\nSo from turn5: y=2, we do U at turn5: then turn6: y=3.\n\nThen we have 4 more moves to turn10? Actually, we are at turn6. We have until turn10: that's 4 turns (turns 6,7,8,9) to cover from y=3 to y=9? That requires 6 steps? So we cannot get to y=9 by turn9? We would be at y=3+4=7 at turn10? But then at turn10 we are at y=7 (freeway7) -> unsafe.\n\nSo we need to slow down.\n\nWe can try to wait at a safe freeway until after turn11. But the safe freeways at turns 10 and 11 are only freeway1 and freeway2? So we can stay at freeway1 or freeway2 during turns 10 and 11.\n\nBut we are at y=3 at turn6. How to get to freeway1 (y=1) or freeway2 (y=2) at turn10? That would require moving down.\n\nBut we are at y=3 at turn6. We have 4 moves (turns 6,7,8,9) to get to y=1 or 2 at turn10? Actually, at turn10 we are at the position after the action at turn9. So:\n\nAt turn6: we are at y=3.\n\nThen we can do:\n\nTurn6: D -> y=2 at turn7.\nTurn7: D -> y=1 at turn8.\nTurn8: S -> y=1 at turn9.\nTurn9: S -> y=1 at turn10.\n\nThen at turn10: we are at y=1 (freeway1) and safe? Yes, because unsafe freeways at T=10: 3-8 only.\n\nThen we can start going up again.\n\nBut note: at turn7: we are at y=2 (freeway2) at T=7 -> safe? Yes, because unsafe at T=7: only freeway1.\n\nTurn8: at y=1 (freeway1) at T=8 -> safe? Yes (no unsafe freeway at T=8).\n\nTurn9: at y=1 (freeway1) at T=9 -> safe? Yes.\n\nTurn10: at y=1 -> safe.\n\nThen we can go up:\n\nTurn10: U -> y=2 at turn11.\nAt turn11: we are at y=2 (freeway2) -> safe? At T=11, unsafe freeways: 3-8 -> freeway2 safe.\n\nThen turn11: U -> y=3 at turn12.\nTurn12: U -> y=4 at turn13.\nTurn13: U -> y=5 at turn14.\nTurn14: U -> y=6 at turn15.\nTurn15: U -> y=7 at turn16.\nTurn16: U -> y=8 at turn17.\nTurn17: U -> y=9 at turn18.\n\nBut we want minimal H. This took 17 actions? H=17? But we started at turn2 and ended at turn2+17=19? And we did 17 actions: from turn2 to turn18? Then H=17.\n\nBut we can do better? Maybe we don't have to go all the way down to y=1. We can wait at y=2? But at turn10 and 11, we can be at y=2 as well.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to be at y=0 at turn10 and 11? Then we are safe.\n\nBut let me try to optimize.\n\nAfter turn5: we are at y=2 (safe) at turn5. Then we have 5 moves until turn10? Actually, from turn5 to turn10: we have turns 5,6,7,8,9 (5 actions) to determine the state at turn10.\n\nWe need to be at y in {0,1,2,9} at turn10. But we start at y=2 at turn5. We can move up or down.\n\nBut if we move up, we might get stuck at freeways3-8 at turn10. So we have to move down? \n\nIf we move down from y=2 at turn5:\n\nTurn5: D -> turn6: y=1 -> safe (T=6: unsafe only freeway1? but we are at freeway1? wait, at T=6, freeway1 is unsafe! -> collision.\n\nOh no! At turn6: if we are at y=1 (freeway1) and T=6, then freeway1 is unsafe -> collision.\n\nSo we cannot be at freeway1 at turn6.\n\nSimilarly, we cannot be at freeway1 at turn7.\n\nSo if we are at y=1 at turn6 or turn7: collision.\n\nTherefore, we must avoid freeway1 at turns6 and7.\n\nSo from turn5 (y=2) we cannot go down to y=1 at turn6 (because unsafe at turn6).\n\nWe can stay at y=2 at turn6? Then at turn6: we are at freeway2 -> safe? At T=6, unsafe freeways: only freeway1 -> so freeway2 is safe.\n\nThen at turn6: we are at y=2. Then we can do:\n\nTurn6: D -> y=1 at turn7 -> but at turn7: freeway1 is unsafe -> collision.\n\nTurn6: S -> y=2 at turn7 -> safe? T=7: unsafe freeways: freeway1 -> freeway2 safe.\n\nTurn6: U -> y=3 at turn7 -> safe? T=7: unsafe only freeway1 -> freeway3 safe.\n\nBut then we are at y=3 at turn7. Then we have to avoid freeways3-8 at turn10 and 11.\n\nFrom turn7: y=3, we have 3 moves (turns7,8,9) to get to a safe y at turn10.\n\nWe can go down: \n  Turn7: D -> turn8: y=2\n  Turn8: D -> turn9: y=1 -> but at turn9: freeway1 safe? T=9: safe. Then turn9: we can do S: then turn10: y=1 -> safe? T=10: freeway1 safe.\n\nBut wait: at turn9: we are at y=1 (freeway1) -> safe. Then at turn9 we can choose to stay: then turn10: y=1 -> safe.\n\nThen we can proceed:\n\nTurn10: U -> y=2 at turn11 -> safe (freeway2 at T=11: safe).\nTurn11: U -> y=3 at turn12 -> safe? T=12: no unsafe freeways? Then we can go up to 9.\n\nSo the path:\n\nTurn2: U -> y=1 at turn3 (safe: T=3, freeway1 safe)\nTurn3: S -> y=1 at turn4 (safe: T=4, freeway1 safe? yes, unsafe only freeway2)\nTurn4: U -> y=2 at turn5 (safe: T=5, freeway2 safe)\nTurn5: S -> y=2 at turn6 (safe: T=6, freeway2 safe? yes, unsafe only freeway1)\nTurn6: S -> y=2 at turn7 (safe: T=7, freeway2 safe? yes, unsafe only freeway1)\nTurn7: D -> y=1 at turn8? But wait: at turn8: T=8, freeway1: safe? yes. But we have to get to turn10 at a safe state.\n\nBut we are at turn7: y=2. Then we do:\n\nTurn7: D -> y=1 at turn8 (safe: T=8, freeway1 safe)\nTurn8: S -> y=1 at turn9 (safe: T=9, freeway1 safe)\nTurn9: S -> y=1 at turn10 (safe: T=10, freeway1 safe)\nTurn10: U -> y=2 at turn11 (safe: T=11, freeway2 safe)\nTurn11: U -> y=3 at turn12 (safe: T=12, freeway3 safe? yes, because unsafe freeways at T=12: none)\nTurn12: U -> y=4 at turn13\nTurn13: U -> y=5 at turn14\nTurn14: U -> y=6 at turn15\nTurn15: U -> y=7 at turn16\nTurn16: U -> y=8 at turn17\nTurn17: U -> y=9 at turn18\n\nSo we reached y=9 at turn18. Then H=17 actions (from turn2 to turn18-1=17? Actually, the actions are at turns: 2,3,...,17 (16 actions?) -> no, 17 actions: from turn2 to turn18-1? Let me count:\n\nWe take an action at each turn from 2 to 17 (inclusive) -> 16 turns? But we did 17 actions? Actually:\n\nActions: \n  turn2: action1\n  turn3: action2\n  ...\n  turn17: action16? -> then we would be at turn18: y=9.\n\nBut we have 16 actions? But we need 17? Let me count the actions we listed:\n\n1. turn2: U\n2. turn3: S\n3. turn4: U\n4. turn5: S\n5. turn6: S\n6. turn7: D\n7. turn8: S\n8. turn9: S\n9. turn10: U\n10. turn11: U\n11. turn12: U\n12. turn13: U\n13. turn14: U\n14. turn15: U\n15. turn16: U\n16. turn17: U\n\nThat's 16 actions. Then at turn18: we are at y=9.\n\nBut we started at turn2: y=0.\nAfter action1 (turn2): at turn3: y=1.\nAfter action2 (turn3): at turn4: y=1? (S) -> wait, no: at turn3 we are at y=1, then we do S -> at turn4: y=1.\n\nThen action3 (turn4): U -> at turn5: y=2.\n\nThen action4 (turn5): S -> at turn6: y=2.\n\nThen action5 (turn6): S -> at turn7: y=2.\n\nThen action6 (turn7): D -> at turn8: y=1.\n\nThen action7 (turn8): S -> at turn9: y=1.\n\nThen action8 (turn9): S -> at turn10: y=1.\n\nThen action9 (turn10): U -> at turn11: y=2.\n\nThen action10 (turn11): U -> at turn12: y=3.\n\nThen action11 (turn12): U -> at turn13: y=4.\n\n... until action16 (turn17): U -> at turn18: y=9.\n\nSo H=16? But we have 16 actions. Then the answer would be 16.\n\nBut is there a shorter path?\n\nWe could try to go up faster and then wait at a safe freeway? But we have to avoid turn10 and turn11 at freeways3-8.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to be at y=0 at turn10 and 11? Then we can avoid freeways altogether.\n\nWe start at turn2: y=0.\n\nWe can do:\n\nTurn2: U -> turn3: y=1 (safe)\nTurn3: U -> but we cannot at turn4 be at y=2? So we must avoid. \n\nTurn3: S -> turn4: y=1 (safe)\nTurn4: U -> turn5: y=2 (safe)\nThen we have 5 moves to get to y=0 at turn10? \n\nFrom turn5: y=2, we can move down:\n\nTurn5: D -> turn6: y=1 -> but at turn6: freeway1 unsafe -> collision.\n\nSo we cannot go down at turn5.\n\nTurn5: S -> turn6: y=2 (safe)\nTurn6: D -> turn7: y=1 -> unsafe at turn7 (freeway1 unsafe) -> collision.\n\nTurn6: S -> turn7: y=2 (safe)\nTurn7: D -> turn8: y=1 (safe? T=8: freeway1 safe) \nTurn8: D -> but we are at y=1 at turn8, then D would go to y=0 at turn9 -> safe (y=0)\nTurn9: S -> turn10: y=0 (safe)\n\nThen we can start going up from turn10:\n\nTurn10: U -> turn11: y=1 (safe: T=11, freeway1 safe? yes, unsafe only 3-8)\nTurn11: U -> turn12: y=2 (safe)\nThen U all the way: \n  turn12: U->y3, turn13:U->y4, ... turn17:U->y8, turn18:U->y9.\n\nSo we end at turn18: y=9.\n\nActions: \n  turn2: U\n  turn3: S\n  turn4: U\n  turn5: S\n  turn6: S\n  turn7: D\n  turn8: D\n  turn9: S\n  turn10: U\n  turn11: U\n  turn12: U\n  turn13: U\n  turn14: U\n  turn15: U\n  turn16: U\n  turn17: U\n\nThat's 16 actions as well.\n\nCan we do it in 15?\n\nThe minimal without obstacles is 9. But with obstacles, we have to wait.\n\nWe have to avoid turn4 at y=2, turn6 and7 at y=1, and turn10 and11 at y>=3.\n\nWe are forced to spend extra turns.\n\nBut note: we might be able to be at y=9 at an earlier turn? \n\nWe see that the earliest we can be at y=9 is after 9 actions? But we have to avoid obstacles so we take detours.\n\nIn both paths we have 16 actions.\n\nBut let me see if we can skip some waiting.\n\nAlternative: after turn5 we are at y=2. Then we go up to y=3 at turn6 (safe: T=6, freeway3 safe). Then we have to avoid turn10 and11 at freeways3-8. So we can go up to y=9 quickly? But we are at y=3 at turn6. We need 6 moves to get to y=9: so at turn12 we would be at y=9. But we have to be at freeways at turns7,8,9,10,11? \n\nSpecifically, at turn10: we would be at y=3+ (10-6)= 3+4=7? Because from turn6 to turn10: 4 actions -> 4 moves? So at turn10: y=3 + (number of U moves - D moves) over 4 actions. To maximize progress, we do 4 U: y=7 at turn10 -> unsafe.\n\nWe can do only 3 U and 1 S? Then at turn10: y=6 -> unsafe.\n\nWe can do 2 U and 2 D? Then we might be at y=3 at turn10? But that's unsafe.\n\nSo we cannot avoid being at a freeway3-8 at turn10 if we are at y>=3 at turn6.\n\nTherefore, we must be at y<=2 at turn10.\n\nSo we have to spend some moves going down.\n\nBut we can try to be at y=2 at turn10 by:\n\nAt turn6: we are at y=2 (we did not go up to y=3). Then we can stay at y=2 until turn10? \n\nFrom turn5: y=2, we did:\n  turn5: S -> turn6: y=2\n  turn6: S -> turn7: y=2\n  turn7: S -> turn8: y=2\n  turn8: S -> turn9: y=2\n  turn9: S -> turn10: y=2 -> safe.\n\nThen we can go up:\n\nTurn10: U -> y3 at turn11 -> but at turn11: freeway3 unsafe? T=11: unsafe freeways: 3-8 -> unsafe.\n\nSo we cannot go up at turn10? We must wait until turn12 to be at freeway3? \n\nAt turn10: y=2 -> safe.\nTurn10: we can do U -> turn11: y=3 -> unsafe at turn11 (freeway3 at T=11: unsafe).\n\nSo we have to stay at y<=2 at turn11 as well.\n\nAt turn10: we can do S: then turn11: y=2 -> safe (freeway2 at T=11: safe).\nThen turn11: U -> turn12: y=3 -> safe (T=12: safe).\n\nThen we can go up: turn12:U,13:U,...,17:U -> y=9 at turn18.\n\nBut then we have:\n\nActions:\n  turn2: U\n  turn3: S\n  turn4: U -> turn5: y=2\n  turn5: S -> turn6: y=2\n  turn6: S -> turn7: y=2\n  turn7: S -> turn8: y=2\n  turn8: S -> turn9: y=2\n  turn9: S -> turn10: y=2\n  turn10: S -> turn11: y=2\n  turn11: U -> turn12: y=3\n  turn12: U -> y4\n  ...\n  turn17: U -> y9 at turn18.\n\nThat's 16 actions: from turn2 to turn17: 16 actions.\n\nBut we have more actions? 16 actions: turn2 to turn17 -> 16 actions, and then at turn18: y=9.\n\nBut we did 16 actions? The count:\n\n1. turn2: U\n2. turn3: S\n3. turn4: U\n4. turn5: S\n5. turn6: S\n6. turn7: S\n7. turn8: S\n8. turn9: S\n9. turn10: S\n10. turn11: U\n11. turn12: U\n12. turn13: U\n13. turn14: U\n14. turn15: U\n15. turn16: U\n16. turn17: U\n\n16 actions. Then we end at turn18.\n\nBut is there a way to do 15 actions? Then we would end at turn17: y=9.\n\nWe need to be at y=9 at turn17.\n\nThat means we must be at y=8 at turn16.\n\nWe have to avoid the obstacles.\n\nWe know we have to be at y<=2 at turn10 and turn11.\n\nSo at turn10: y<=2, and at turn11: y<=2.\n\nThen from turn11 to turn16: 5 actions to go from y<=2 to y=8 at turn16.\n\nThe maximum we can go: 5 ups: y=2+5=7 at turn16? Not 8.\n\nWe need to be at y=8 at turn16. So we must have been at y=3 at turn11? But then at turn11: y=3 -> freeway3 -> unsafe.\n\nSo we cannot be at y>=3 at turn11.\n\nTherefore, we must be at y<=2 at turn11.\n\nThen from turn11 to turn16: 5 actions -> maximum y=2+5=7 at turn16. Then we need one more move to y=8 at turn17? But then we would need 17 actions to get to y=9 at turn18.\n\nSo it seems 16 actions is minimal.\n\nBut wait: we might be able to be at y=9 at an earlier turn if we take a different route? For example, by going down to y=0 earlier and then going up faster? But we still have to avoid the obstacles.\n\nWe start at turn2: y=0.\n\nWe can do:\n\nTurn2: S -> turn3: y=0 (safe)\nTurn3: U -> turn4: y=1 (safe: T=4, freeway1 safe)\nTurn4: U -> but at turn5: y=2 -> safe? T=5: safe.\nThen same as before.\n\nBut then we are at y=2 at turn5, and we have to avoid freeway1 at turn6 and7, and then avoid freeways3-8 at turn10,11.\n\nSo we still need to wait.\n\nAlternatively, we can go up to y=3 at some point and then come down to y=0 at turn10? But then we have to go from y=0 to y=9 in 7 moves? That would take 7 actions: from turn10 to turn17: \n  turn10: y=0\n  turn11: U->y1\n  turn12: U->y2\n  turn13: U->y3\n  turn14: U->y4\n  turn15: U->y5\n  turn16: U->y6\n  turn17: U->y7 -> not 9.\n\nWe need 9 moves from y=0 to y=9, so at least 9 actions. But we start at turn10: so we would be at y=9 at turn19? That would be 17 actions? Worse.\n\nTherefore, 16 actions seems minimal.\n\nNow, we have two paths that take 16 actions. We can choose the first one we found.\n\nBut note: we have to output the actions.\n\nWe'll choose the first path we found that goes down to y=1 and then back up.\n\nBut the second path that goes down to y=0 might be equivalent.\n\nBut in the first path, we did:\n\n  turn2: U\n  turn3: S\n  turn4: U\n  turn5: S\n  turn6: S\n  turn7: D\n  turn8: S\n  turn9: S\n  turn10: U\n  turn11: U\n  turn12: U\n  turn13: U\n  turn14: U\n  turn15: U\n  turn16: U\n  turn17: U\n\nBut wait: at turn7 we did D: from y=2 to y=1 at turn8? Actually, at turn7 we are at y=2, then we do D -> at turn8: y=1.\n\nThen at turn8: we do S -> at turn9: y=1.\n\nThen at turn9: we do S -> at turn10: y=1.\n\nThen we go up.\n\nBut we could do:\n\n  turn7: D -> turn8: y=1\n  turn8: D -> turn9: y=0\n  turn9: S -> turn10: y=0\n\nThen we are at y=0 at turn10.\n\nThen we can go up:\n\n  turn10: U -> turn11: y=1 (safe: T=11, freeway1 safe)\n  turn11: U -> turn12: y2\n  turn12: U -> y3\n  ... \n  turn17: U -> y8\n  turn18: U -> y9\n\nBut that would be 17 actions? Because we have to add one more U at turn18.\n\nBut we already have 16 actions? Let me list:\n\n1. turn2: U\n2. turn3: S\n3. turn4: U\n4. turn5: S\n5. turn6: S\n6. turn7: D\n7. turn8: D\n8. turn9: S\n9. turn10: U\n10. turn11: U\n11. turn12: U\n12. turn13: U\n13. turn14: U\n14. turn15: U\n15. turn16: U\n16. turn17: U -> then at turn18: y=9? But we did 16 actions, so we end at turn18: y=9.\n\nBut at turn17: we are at y=8? Then after action16 (at turn17): we go to y=9 at turn18.\n\nYes.\n\nBut we have 16 actions. So both are 16.\n\nWe can choose any.\n\nI'll choose the first one that doesn't go to y=0:\n\nPath:\n  turn2: U\n  turn3: S\n  turn4: U\n  turn5: S\n  turn6: S\n  turn7: D\n  turn8: S\n  turn9: S\n  turn10: U\n  turn11: U\n  turn12: U\n  turn13: U\n  turn14: U\n  turn15: U\n  turn16: U\n  turn17: U\n\nBut wait, at turn7: we do D: from y=2 to y=1 at turn8? Actually, at the beginning of turn7, we are at y=2. We do D: then at turn8, we are at y=1.\n\nThen at turn8: we do S: stay at y=1 at turn9.\nThen at turn9: S: stay at y=1 at turn10.\n\nThen at turn10: U: to y=2 at turn11.\nThen U to y=3 at turn12, etc.\n\nBut we have to ensure that at turn8 and turn9 we are safe: \n  turn8: T=8, freeway1: safe? (yes, no unsafe freeways at T=8)\n  turn9: T=9, freeway1: safe? (yes)\n\nAnd turn10: T=10, freeway1: safe? (yes, because unsafe are 3-8)\n\nSo it's safe.\n\nNow, write the answer.\n\nThe minimal H is 16.\n\nAnswer:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 2: U\nTurn 3: S\nTurn 4: U\nTurn 5: S\nTurn 6: S\nTurn 7: D\nTurn 8: S\nTurn 9: S\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: U\nTurn 16: U\nTurn 17: U\n}\n\nBut note: the actions are for turns from t1=2 to t1+H-1=2+16-1=17. So the last action is at turn17.\n\nWe have 16 actions: turns 2 to 17 inclusive -> 16 turns? But we need H=16 actions.\n\nYes.\n\nWe can double-check the y at each turn:\n\nTurn2: y=0 (safe) -> action U -> turn3: y=1.\nTurn3: y=1 (freeway1) -> safe (T=3: freeway1 safe) -> action S -> turn4: y=1.\nTurn4: y=1 (freeway1) -> safe (T=4: freeway1 safe) -> action U -> turn5: y=2.\nTurn5: y=2 (freeway2) -> safe (T=5: safe) -> action S -> turn6: y=2.\nTurn6: y=2 (freeway2) -> safe (T=6: freeway2 safe) -> action S -> turn7: y=2.\nTurn7: y=2 (freeway2) -> safe (T=7: freeway2 safe) -> action D -> turn8: y=1.\nTurn8: y=1 (freeway1) -> safe (T=8: safe) -> action S -> turn9: y=1.\nTurn9: y=1 (freeway1) -> safe (T=9: safe) -> action S -> turn10: y=1.\nTurn10: y=1 (freeway1) -> safe (T=10: safe) -> action U -> turn11: y=2.\nTurn11: y=2 (freeway2) -> safe (T=11: safe) -> action U -> turn12: y=3.\nTurn12: y=3 (freeway3) -> safe (T=12: safe) -> action U -> turn13: y=4.\nTurn13: y=4 -> safe -> action U -> turn14: y=5.\nTurn14: y=5 -> safe -> action U -> turn15: y=6.\nTurn15: y=6 -> safe -> action U -> turn16: y=7.\nTurn16: y=7 -> safe -> action U -> turn17: y=8.\nTurn17: y=8 (freeway8) -> safe? T=17: we did not compute beyond 12? \n\nWe must check T=17 for freeway8.\n\nWe have freeways 3-8: \n  carA: (-48,-59,right,6) -> at T=17: [ -59+6*(17-2)= -59+6*15=-59+90=31, -48+90=42] -> 0 not in [31,42] -> safe.\n  carB: [ -11+6*15= -11+90=79, 6*15=90] -> safe.\n\nFreeway1 and 2: we don't care because we are on freeway8.\n\nSo safe.\n\nThen action U at turn17: leads to turn18: y=9 -> goal.\n\nPerfect.\n\nSo this path is safe and has 16 actions.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 16.\n\nWe output the actions.\n</think>\nTo reach the position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 0) at turn \\(t_1 = 2\\) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the following sequence of actions is determined to be optimal, requiring 16 turns (actions). The sequence ensures that at each turn from 2 to 17, the player's position avoids collisions based on the car movement rules and unsafe freeway conditions derived from the car states at turn 2.\n\nThe unsafe freeways by turn, calculated from the car update rules, are:\n- Turn 2: Freeways 3–8 unsafe\n- Turn 3: Freeways 3–8 unsafe\n- Turn 4: Freeway 2 unsafe\n- Turn 6: Freeway 1 unsafe\n- Turn 7: Freeway 1 unsafe\n- Turn 10: Freeways 3–8 unsafe\n- Turn 11: Freeways 3–8 unsafe\n\nThe path is designed to:\n- Avoid freeway 2 at turn 4 by staying at \\(y = 1\\).\n- Avoid freeway 1 at turns 6 and 7 by staying at \\(y = 2\\).\n- Avoid freeways 3–8 at turns 10 and 11 by being at \\(y = 1\\) or \\(y = 2\\).\n- Proceed upward efficiently after turn 11 when all freeways are safe.\n\nThe sequence of actions and resulting positions are:\n\n- **Turn 2 (position \\(y = 0\\))**: Action `U` → Turn 3: \\(y = 1\\) (safe, freeway 1 safe at turn 3).\n- **Turn 3 (position \\(y = 1\\))**: Action `S` → Turn 4: \\(y = 1\\) (safe, freeway 1 safe at turn 4, freeway 2 unsafe avoided).\n- **Turn 4 (position \\(y = 1\\))**: Action `U` → Turn 5: \\(y = 2\\) (safe, freeway 2 safe at turn 5).\n- **Turn 5 (position \\(y = 2\\))**: Action `S` → Turn 6: \\(y = 2\\) (safe, freeway 2 safe at turn 6, freeway 1 unsafe avoided).\n- **Turn 6 (position \\(y = 2\\))**: Action `S` → Turn 7: \\(y = 2\\) (safe, freeway 2 safe at turn 7, freeway 1 unsafe avoided).\n- **Turn 7 (position \\(y = 2\\))**: Action `D` → Turn 8: \\(y = 1\\) (safe, freeway 1 safe at turn 8).\n- **Turn 8 (position \\(y = 1\\))**: Action `S` → Turn 9: \\(y = 1\\) (safe, freeway 1 safe at turn 9).\n- **Turn 9 (position \\(y = 1\\))**: Action `S` → Turn 10: \\(y = 1\\) (safe, freeway 1 safe at turn 10, freeways 3–8 unsafe avoided).\n- **Turn 10 (position \\(y = 1\\))**: Action `U` → Turn 11: \\(y = 2\\) (safe, freeway 2 safe at turn 11, freeways 3–8 unsafe avoided).\n- **Turn 11 (position \\(y = 2\\))**: Action `U` → Turn 12: \\(y = 3\\) (safe, freeway 3 safe at turn 12).\n- **Turn 12 (position \\(y = 3\\))**: Action `U` → Turn 13: \\(y = 4\\) (safe).\n- **Turn 13 (position \\(y = 4\\))**: Action `U` → Turn 14: \\(y = 5\\) (safe).\n- **Turn 14 (position \\(y = 5\\))**: Action `U` → Turn 15: \\(y = 6\\) (safe).\n- **Turn 15 (position \\(y = 6\\))**: Action `U` → Turn 16: \\(y = 7\\) (safe).\n- **Turn 16 (position \\(y = 7\\))**: Action `U` → Turn 17: \\(y = 8\\) (safe, freeway 8 safe at turn 16).\n- **Turn 17 (position \\(y = 8\\))**: Action `U` → Turn 18: \\(y = 9\\) (goal reached).\n\nThis path achieves \\(y = 9\\) at turn 18 (after 16 actions from turn 2 to turn 17) and is collision-free.

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 4, and the player is at (0,1). The goal is to reach (0,9) in the minimal number of turns without colliding with cars on the freeways (y=1 to y=8).\n\nImportant: Collision occurs at turn T if the player is on a freeway y (from 1 to 8) and at that turn, the car on that freeway has a span that includes 0 (the x-coordinate of the player).\n\nNote: When moving, the player is on a freeway at the turn when they are on that row. Specifically, at turn T, the player is at (0, y_T). If the player moves at turn T (by U, D, or S), then at turn T+1, they are at (0, y_{T+1}).\n\nCrucial: The problem states that if at turn T you move to a new row (so y_{T+1} != y_T), then at turn T you are still on row y_T and at turn T+1 you are on row y_{T+1}. Therefore, at turn T, you only check the car on row y_T, and at turn T+1, you check the car on row y_{T+1}.\n\nWe need to plan a sequence of actions (U, D, S) from turn 4 (t1) to turn 4+H-1 such that at turn 4+H-1, the player is at y=9.\n\nThe player starts at y=1 at turn 4.\n\nWe have car information for freeways 1 to 8. Note that freeway 1 is y=1, freeway 2 is y=2, etc.\n\nLet me write down the car state at turn 4 (current turn) for each freeway:\n\nFreeway 1 (y=1):\n  - (60,49,right,6) -> but note: for right-moving, the head is the larger number? Actually, the representation is (head, tail, direction, speed). For right-moving: the car moves to the right. So at time t, the car spans from tail to head? But note the update rule:\n\nFor right-moving: \n  Span(t1) = [tau, h] -> becomes [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)] at time T.\n\nBut in the table, we have for freeway 1: (60,49,right,6). Since it's right-moving, the head (h) is the front, which is at 60, and the tail (tau) is at 49? But then the span at t1=4 is [49,60]? However, the update rule for right-moving says:\n  Span(t1) = [tau, h] -> so they write the tail first? But in the table, it's written as (head, tail, ...). Let me check the example:\n\nThe problem says for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [tau, h]\". But the table entry is (head, tail, ...). So in the table, the first number is head, the second is tail.\n\nTherefore, for a right-moving car, the span at t1 is [tail, head] = [49,60] for the first car on freeway1? But wait, 49 to 60? That's 12 units? But the update rule for right-moving: \n  [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nSimilarly, left-moving: [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\n\nSo for freeway1 at turn4:\n  Car1: (60,49,right,6) -> span at turn4: [49,60] (because for right, we use [tail, head]? But note the problem says: for right-moving, Span(t1) = [tau, h] -> so tau=49, h=60 -> [49,60]. \n  Car2: (24,13,right,6) -> [13,24]\n  Car3: (-12,-23,right,6) -> [-23,-12]\n\nBut note: the collision condition is that at turn T, if the player is on freeway i, then we require that 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway? Then collision.\n\nSo at turn4, the player is at (0,1). We must check freeway1 (y=1) at turn4: \n  Car1: [49,60] -> 0 is not in [49,60] -> safe.\n  Car2: [13,24] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n  Car3: [-23,-12] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\nSimilarly, we need to check for future turns.\n\nOur goal: get to y=9. The minimal number of moves? Since we are at y=1 and need to get to y=9, the minimal moves without any obstacles would be 8 moves of U (because each U increases y by 1). But we have to avoid cars.\n\nWe have to consider the movement of cars. The cars are moving at constant speed.\n\nLet me write the car positions at a future turn T (relative to t1=4: so T = 4 + t, where t>=0) for each freeway.\n\nFreeway 1 (y=1): three cars, all right-moving, speed 6.\n  Car1: at T, span = [49 + 6*(T-4), 60 + 6*(T-4)]\n  Car2: [13 + 6*(T-4), 24 + 6*(T-4)]\n  Car3: [-23 + 6*(T-4), -12 + 6*(T-4)]\n\nFreeway 2 (y=2): one car: (24, -11, right, 36) -> so at turn4: span = [-11,24] (since right: [tail, head] = [-11,24])\n  At turn T: [-11 + 36*(T-4), 24 + 36*(T-4)]\n\nFreeway 3 to 8: each has two cars: \n  (-36,-47,right,6) and (12,1,right,6)\n\nFor freeway 3 (y=3):\n  Car1: (-36,-47,right,6) -> span at turn4: [-47, -36] -> at T: [-47 + 6*(T-4), -36 + 6*(T-4)]\n  Car2: (12,1,right,6) -> [1,12] -> at T: [1 + 6*(T-4), 12 + 6*(T-4)]\n\nSimilarly for freeway 4,5,6,7,8: same as freeway3.\n\nNow, note that the player must avoid being on a freeway row when a car on that row has a span that includes 0.\n\nWe are at turn4 at y=1. We can choose to stay (S), move up (U) to y=2, or move down (D) to y=0? But note: y must be in [0,9]. If we move down from y=1, we go to y=0. But the goal is y=9, so going down is not helpful. We might have to go down temporarily to avoid a car? But let's see.\n\nThe minimal path is to go up 8 times. But we must check if at each step (each turn) when we are on a freeway row (1 to 8) that 0 is not in the span of any car on that row at that turn.\n\nWe plan the sequence of actions and the turns at which we are on each row.\n\nWe start at turn4 at y=1.\n\nWe need to simulate the future turns and check for collisions.\n\nLet me denote the turn relative to t1: let t=0 corresponds to turn4 (current turn). Then at time t (relative), the absolute turn is 4+t.\n\nPlayer position at relative time t: y_t (starting at t=0: y0=1)\n\nWe are to find a sequence of actions a_0, a_1, ... a_{H-1} (each at relative time t=0,1,...,H-1) such that at the end of the sequence (after H steps) we are at y=9.\n\nThe minimal H is at least 8 (if we go up 8 times). But we might need to wait (S) sometimes to avoid cars, so H might be more.\n\nWe'll try to achieve H=8 if possible, then if not, try H=9, etc.\n\nBut note: we might also go down to avoid a car and then up again, but that would take more steps. So minimal H might be 8 or 9 or more.\n\nWe'll try to simulate step by step.\n\nStep 0 (absolute turn4, relative t=0): we are at y=1. We choose an action a0.\n\nBut note: we have to choose an action for turn4 (current turn). Then we move to the next state.\n\nWe must avoid being on a row when 0 is in the car span on that row at the same turn.\n\nAt turn4 (t=0) at y=1: \n  Check freeway1: cars at [49,60], [13,24], [-23,-12] -> 0 not in any -> safe.\n\nWe can choose to go up (U) to y=2 at the next turn (turn5) or stay (S) at y=1 for turn5, or down (D) to y=0 at turn5.\n\nBut note: if we choose U at turn4 (t=0), then at the next state (turn5, t=1) we will be at y=2. And at turn5, we must check freeway2 (because at turn5 we are on y=2).\n\nSimilarly, if we choose S at turn4, then at turn5 we are still at y=1 and then we check freeway1 at turn5.\n\nWe want to minimize H, so we prefer going up.\n\nLet me compute the car positions at future turns.\n\nFirst, for freeway1 (y=1) at turn T (absolute) = 4 + t:\n  Car1: [49 + 6t, 60 + 6t]\n  Car2: [13 + 6t, 24 + 6t]\n  Car3: [-23 + 6t, -12 + 6t]\n\nWhen is 0 in one of these? \n  Car1: 49+6t <= 0 <= 60+6t -> but 49+6t is at least 49>0 for t>=0 -> no.\n  Car2: 13+6t <=0<=24+6t -> but 13+6t>=13>0 -> no.\n  Car3: -23+6t <=0<=-12+6t -> \n        -23+6t <=0 -> 6t<=23 -> t<=3.83 -> so t=0,1,2,3 -> but note:\n        Also 0<=-12+6t -> 6t>=12 -> t>=2.\n        So for t=2,3: \n          t=2: [-23+12, -12+12] = [-11,0] -> 0 is included? [a,b] includes a and b? Since it's a closed interval? The problem says \"0 in the span\", so if the span is [a,b] then if a<=0<=b, then yes.\n\n        At t=2: [-11,0] -> 0 is included -> collision if we are on freeway1 at t=2 (absolute turn6).\n        t=3: [-23+18, -12+18] = [-5,6] -> 0 is in [-5,6] -> collision.\n\n        t=4: [-23+24, -12+24] = [1,12] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\nSo freeway1 is dangerous at absolute turns: \n  t=2 (relative) -> absolute turn4+2=6 -> collision at turn6 if on freeway1.\n  t=3 (relative) -> absolute turn7 -> collision.\n\nBut note: we are at turn4 (t=0) on freeway1 and safe. We are going to leave freeway1 at some turn.\n\nNow, freeway2 (y=2): one car: at T=4+t: span = [-11 + 36t, 24 + 36t]\n\nWhen is 0 in this interval?\n  -11+36t <= 0 <= 24+36t\n\n  The left inequality: -11+36t<=0 -> 36t<=11 -> t<=0.305 -> so only t=0? \n    t=0: [-11,24] -> 0 is in [-11,24] -> so at turn4 (t=0) on freeway2? But at turn4 we are not on freeway2 (we are on y=1). \n\n  But if we are on freeway2 at turn T (absolute turn 4+t) then:\n    t=0: [ -11, 24] -> 0 in -> collision.\n    t=1: [ -11+36, 24+36] = [25,60] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n    t=2: [ -11+72, 24+72] = [61,96] -> safe.\n\n  So freeway2 is dangerous only at t=0 (absolute turn4) and then becomes safe.\n\nBut we are at turn4 at y=1, so if we move to y=2 at turn4 (by U at turn4) then at turn5 we are at y=2? Let me clarify:\n\nAt turn4 (current turn): we are at y=1. We choose an action at turn4: \n  If we choose U, then at turn5 we will be at y=2.\n\nBut note: the action at turn4 determines the move that happens at the end of turn4 to the beginning of turn5. So at turn4, we are still at y=1. Then we move to y=2 at the start of turn5.\n\nTherefore, we are on freeway2 at turn5? Yes, at turn5 the player is at (0,2). Then we check freeway2 at turn5: which is t=1 relative to our base? But note: our base time t: \n  At absolute turn4: t=0\n  At absolute turn5: t=1\n\nSo at turn5 (t=1) for freeway2: [ -11+36*1, 24+36*1] = [25,60] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\nTherefore, if we go up at turn4, we will be at y=2 at turn5 and that is safe.\n\nBut wait: what about freeway2 at turn4? We never were on freeway2 at turn4. We were on freeway1 at turn4.\n\nNow, if we stay at turn4 (S) then at turn5 we are still at y=1. Then we check freeway1 at turn5: which is t=1 relative.\n\nAt t=1 for freeway1:\n  Car3: [-23+6*1, -12+6*1] = [-17,-6] -> 0 not in -> safe? But we know that at t=2 and t=3 (absolute turns6 and7) freeway1 is dangerous.\n\nBut at t=1 (absolute turn5) freeway1 is safe.\n\nNow, freeway3 to freeway8: each has two cars.\n\nLet's take freeway3 (y=3) as an example at absolute turn T=4+t:\n  Car1: [-47+6t, -36+6t]\n  Car2: [1+6t, 12+6t]\n\nCheck when 0 is in Car1: \n  -47+6t <= 0 <= -36+6t\n  => 6t <=47 -> t<=7.83\n      and 0<=-36+6t -> 6t>=36 -> t>=6\n  So for t=6,7: \n      t=6: [-47+36, -36+36] = [-11,0] -> 0 included? [a,b] with a<=0<=b -> yes.\n      t=7: [-47+42, -36+42] = [-5,6] -> 0 in.\n\n  t=8: [-47+48, -36+48] = [1,12] -> safe.\n\nCar2: [1+6t, 12+6t] -> 1+6t>0 for t>=0 -> so 0 is never in.\n\nTherefore, freeway3 is dangerous at t=6 and t=7 (absolute turns 10 and 11).\n\nSimilarly, for freeway4: same as freeway3? Yes, the car data is the same. So freeway4 is dangerous at t=6 and t=7 (absolute turns 10 and 11).\n\nSimilarly, freeway5,6,7,8: same danger at t=6 and t=7.\n\nBut note: freeway2 only had danger at t=0 (turn4) which we avoided by not being there at turn4.\n\nNow, we are at turn4 (y=1). We want to go up to y=9.\n\nWe must avoid:\n\n- On freeway1 (y=1) at absolute turns 6 and 7 (relative t=2,3) -> because of car3.\n\n- On freeway3 to freeway8 (y=3 to y=8) at absolute turns 10 and 11 (relative t=6,7) -> because of the first car (the one that was at (-36,-47)).\n\nBut note: we might be able to pass a freeway before the dangerous time or after.\n\nWe start at y=1 at turn4 (t=0).\n\nWe want to go up. Let's try to go up as fast as possible and see if we can avoid the dangerous times.\n\nPlan: \n  Turn4 (t=0): U -> to y=2 at turn5 (t=1)\n  Turn5 (t=1): U -> to y=3 at turn6 (t=2)\n  Turn6 (t=2): U -> to y=4 at turn7 (t=3)\n  Turn7 (t=3): U -> to y=5 at turn8 (t=4)\n  Turn8 (t=4): U -> to y=6 at turn9 (t=5)\n  Turn9 (t=5): U -> to y=7 at turn10 (t=6)\n  Turn10 (t=6): U -> to y=8 at turn11 (t=7)\n  Turn11 (t=7): U -> to y=9 at turn12 (t=8)\n\nBut we must check the freeways we are on at each turn:\n\nAt turn5 (t=1): y=2 -> freeway2: at t=1 (relative) -> [25,60] -> safe.\nAt turn6 (t=2): y=3 -> freeway3: at t=2: \n      Car1: [-47+6*2, -36+6*2] = [-47+12, -36+12] = [-35,-24] -> 0 not in -> safe? \n      Car2: [1+12,12+12] = [13,24] -> safe.\nAt turn7 (t=3): y=4 -> freeway4: at t=3: \n      Car1: [-47+18, -36+18] = [-29,-18] -> safe.\n      Car2: [1+18,12+18] = [19,30] -> safe.\nAt turn8 (t=4): y=5 -> freeway5: at t=4:\n      Car1: [-47+24, -36+24] = [-23,-12] -> 0 not in -> safe? (since -23<=0<=-12? -> 0 is not in [-23,-12] because -23<=0 is true but 0<=-12 is false. So 0 is not in the interval? \n        Actually, the interval is [a,b] and we require a<=x<=b. Here a=-23, b=-12, and 0 is not between -23 and -12? It's above -12? So no. \n        But wait: the car is moving right, so at t=4, it's from -23 to -12 -> which is left of 0 -> so safe.\nAt turn9 (t=5): y=6 -> freeway6: at t=5:\n      Car1: [-47+30, -36+30] = [-17,-6] -> 0 not in -> safe.\nAt turn10 (t=6): y=7 -> freeway7: at t=6: \n      Car1: [-47+36, -36+36] = [-11,0] -> 0 is included -> collision! \n      We are on freeway7 at turn10 (absolute) and the car spans [-11,0] -> 0 is in the span -> collision.\n\nSo we cannot be on freeway7 at turn10 (t=6 relative). Similarly, we cannot be on freeway3 to freeway8 at t=6 or t=7.\n\nIn the above plan, we are on freeway7 at t=6 (relative) which is dangerous.\n\nWe must avoid being on any of the freeways 3 to 8 at t=6 or t=7.\n\nIn the above plan, we are at:\n  turn10 (t=6): y=7 -> freeway7 -> dangerous.\n\nWe need to adjust.\n\nPossible solutions:\n\n1. Delay our arrival at freeways 3-8 so that we pass them either before t=6 or after t=7.\n\n2. Or, wait on a safe freeway during the dangerous times.\n\nBut note: we are at y=1 at turn4. We have to go up to y=9.\n\nThe dangerous freeways are 3 to 8, and the dangerous times are t=6 and t=7 (absolute turns 10 and 11).\n\nWe need to plan so that when we are on freeway3, we are not there at t=6 or t=7. Similarly for freeways 4,5,6,7,8.\n\nBut note: we can control the time we spend on each row by staying (S) on a row.\n\nWe can also go down, but that would take extra steps.\n\nWe are currently at y=1 at turn4. We can try to move up as quickly as possible until we get to a safe row and then wait until the dangerous time passes.\n\nBut the dangerous time is at t=6 and t=7 (absolute turns 10 and 11). \n\nWe want to be above the dangerous freeways (i.e., at y=9) by turn10? But we are starting at turn4. We have 6 turns to get from y=1 to y=9? That would require 8 steps of up, which is 8 turns. So we cannot be at y=9 by turn10 (which is 6 turns from turn4: turn4,5,6,7,8,9,10 -> 7 turns?).\n\nLet me count the turns:\n\nTurn4: we start at y=1.\n\nAfter k actions (k turns), we are at turn4+k.\n\nWe want to avoid being on freeways 3-8 at turn10 (absolute) and turn11 (absolute).\n\nAbsolute turns: \n  turn10: 4+6 -> so relative t=6\n  turn11: 4+7 -> relative t=7\n\nWe can try to be on a row that is not dangerous at those times. The only non-dangerous rows at turn10 and turn11 are:\n  y=0, y=9: but y=0 and y=9 are not freeways? Actually, the freeways are y=1 to y=8. So if we are at y=0 or y=9, we don't check any cars. But we cannot be at y=9 until the end.\n\nAlso, note that at turn10 and turn11, freeway1 and freeway2 are safe? Let's check:\n\nFreeway1 at t=6 (relative): \n  Car3: [-23+6*6, -12+6*6] = [-23+36, -12+36] = [13,24] -> safe? 0 not in -> safe.\n  But earlier we saw freeway1 is dangerous at t=2,3 (relative) which are turns6 and7 (absolute) -> so at t=6 (relative) it's safe.\n\nFreeway2 at t=6: [ -11+36*6, 24+36*6] = [ -11+216, 24+216] = [205,240] -> safe.\n\nSo freeway1 and freeway2 are safe at t=6 and t=7.\n\nTherefore, we can be on freeway1 or freeway2 during the dangerous times (t=6 and t=7) without collision.\n\nSo one plan: \n  We move up quickly to freeway2 (y=2) and then stay there for a few turns until the dangerous time (t=6 and t=7) passes, then move up quickly to y=9.\n\nBut note: we start at y=1 at turn4. We can go to y=2 at turn5 (by U at turn4). Then we can stay at y=2 for several turns.\n\nWe need to avoid the dangerous freeways (3-8) during turns10 and11 (absolute). \n\nWe can stay at y=2 until after turn11? Then we can move up.\n\nBut how many turns do we need to wait? The dangerous period is turn10 and turn11. So we must not be on freeways3-8 at turn10 and turn11.\n\nTherefore, we can leave y=2 at turn12 (absolute) and then go up.\n\nBut note: we are at y=2 at turn5 (if we go U at turn4). Then we can stay at y=2 for turns5,6,7,8,9,10,11? Then at turn12 we leave.\n\nBut we want to minimize H. We don't want to wait that long.\n\nWe can leave earlier as long as we don't hit the dangerous freeways at the dangerous times.\n\nWe are going to move from y=2 to y=9. That requires 7 moves of U. So 7 turns.\n\nWe want to time it so that when we are on freeways3-8, we are not at relative time t=6 or t=7 (absolute turns10 and11).\n\nLet me denote the time when we leave y=2: suppose at relative time t_start (we start moving up from y=2 at relative time t_start, and we do 7 consecutive U moves.\n\nThen we would be:\n  At relative time t_start: at y=2 (we do U to go to y=3 at the next turn)\n  Then:\n      t_start: action U -> at the end of t_start, we move to y=3 at the next turn (relative time t_start+1) we are at y=3.\n      t_start+1: at y=3 -> and we do U -> at t_start+2: y=4.\n      t_start+2: y=4\n      t_start+3: y=5\n      t_start+4: y=6\n      t_start+5: y=7\n      t_start+6: y=8\n      t_start+7: y=9\n\nWe are at y=9 at relative time t_start+7.\n\nWe must avoid being on freeways3-8 at relative times that correspond to absolute turns10 and11.\n\nNote: relative time t corresponds to absolute turn = 4 + t.\n\nWe are on:\n  y=3 at absolute turn: 4 + (t_start+1)\n  y=4 at absolute turn: 4 + (t_start+2)\n  y=5 at absolute turn: 4 + (t_start+3)\n  y=6 at absolute turn: 4 + (t_start+4)\n  y=7 at absolute turn: 4 + (t_start+5)\n  y=8 at absolute turn: 4 + (t_start+6)\n\nWe require that for each of these absolute turns, if it equals 10 or 11, then we must not be on that freeway? But we are on the freeway at that turn.\n\nSo we require that for each row in {3,4,5,6,7,8} and for the absolute turn when we are on that row, that turn is not 10 or 11.\n\nThat is, we require:\n  4 + (t_start+1) != 10 and !=11  -> for y=3\n  4 + (t_start+2) !=10 and !=11 -> for y=4\n  ... \n\nBut note: we are on each row for exactly one turn.\n\nSo we require that the absolute turn for being on row i is not 10 and not 11.\n\nTherefore, we must have:\n  For y=3: 4 + t_start + 1 = t_start+5 !=10 and !=11 -> so t_start+5 !=10 and t_start+5 !=11 -> t_start !=5 and t_start !=6.\n  For y=4: t_start+6 !=10 and !=11 -> t_start !=4 and t_start !=5.\n  For y=5: t_start+7 !=10 and !=11 -> t_start !=3 and t_start !=4.\n  For y=6: t_start+8 !=10 and !=11 -> t_start !=2 and t_start !=3.\n  For y=7: t_start+9 !=10 and !=11 -> t_start !=1 and t_start !=2.\n  For y=8: t_start+10 !=10 and !=11 -> t_start !=0 and t_start !=1.\n\nTherefore, we must have:\n  t_start !=0,1,2,3,4,5,6\n\nBut that's impossible? \n\nWe must avoid t_start being any of these? \n\nWait, let's list the constraints:\n\n1. t_start+5 not in {10,11} -> t_start not in {5,6}\n2. t_start+6 not in {10,11} -> t_start not in {4,5}\n3. t_start+7 not in {10,11} -> t_start not in {3,4}\n4. t_start+8 not in {10,11} -> t_start not in {2,3}\n5. t_start+9 not in {10,11} -> t_start not in {1,2}\n6. t_start+10 not in {10,11} -> t_start not in {0,1}\n\nSo t_start cannot be 0,1,2,3,4,5,6.\n\nBut t_start is the relative time when we start the 7-move sequence. We are currently at y=2 at turn5 (absolute) which is relative t=1 (because turn4 is t=0, turn5 is t=1).\n\nSo we are at y=2 at t=1. We can start the sequence at any t_start >=1.\n\nWe require t_start>=7? Then the absolute turn for being on y=3 is 4+t_start+1 = 5+t_start. \n  We require 5+t_start !=10 and !=11 -> so if t_start>=7, then 5+t_start>=12, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly, the other rows will be at even later times.\n\nSo if we start the sequence at t_start>=7, then we avoid the dangerous times.\n\nBut how many turns do we have to wait at y=2? \n\nWe are at y=2 at relative time t=1 (absolute turn5). We start the sequence at relative time t_start=7 (absolute turn4+7=11). \n\nSo we wait at y=2 for: from t=1 to t=6 (inclusive) -> that's 6 turns: actions at t=1,2,3,4,5,6: all S? \n\nThen at t=7 (relative) we do U to go to y=3 at the next turn (absolute turn11+1? Let me map:\n\nRelative time: \n  t=0: turn4 -> we are at y=1 -> we do U -> then at t=1 (turn5) we are at y=2.\n  Then we do S for the next 6 actions (at t=1 to t=6? but note: the action at a relative time t is taken at absolute turn4+t.\n\n  So:\n    At relative t=1 (absolute turn5): we are at y=2 -> we choose S -> then at turn6 (absolute) we are still at y=2.\n    At t=2 (turn6): S -> at turn7: y=2.\n    At t=3 (turn7): S -> at turn8: y=2.\n    At t=4 (turn8): S -> at turn9: y=2.\n    At t=5 (turn9): S -> at turn10: y=2.\n    At t=6 (turn10): S -> at turn11: y=2.\n\n  Then at t=7 (relative) which is absolute turn11: we are at y=2 -> we choose U -> then at the next turn (absolute turn12) we are at y=3.\n\nThen the sequence for the 7 moves:\n  At t=7 (turn11): U -> to y=3 at turn12.\n  At t=8 (turn12): U -> to y=4 at turn13.\n  At t=9 (turn13): U -> to y=5 at turn14.\n  At t=10 (turn14): U -> to y=6 at turn15.\n  At t=11 (turn15): U -> to y=7 at turn16.\n  At t=12 (turn16): U -> to y=8 at turn17.\n  At t=13 (turn17): U -> to y=9 at turn18.\n\nThen we stop at turn18 (absolute) and we are at y=9. The number of actions is from t=0 to t=13 -> 14 actions? But we started at t=0 (turn4) and did 14 actions, so H=14? \n\nBut we can do better.\n\nWe don't need to wait until t_start=7. We can start earlier as long as we avoid the dangerous absolute turns 10 and 11.\n\nWe require that the absolute turn for being on freeway3 is not 10 or 11: that is 4 + (t_start+1) = t_start+5 not in {10,11} -> so t_start not in {5,6}.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway4: t_start+6 not in {10,11} -> t_start not in {4,5}.\nfreeway5: t_start+7 not in {10,11} -> t_start not in {3,4}\nfreeway6: t_start+8 not in {10,11} -> t_start not in {2,3}\nfreeway7: t_start+9 not in {10,11} -> t_start not in {1,2}\nfreeway8: t_start+10 not in {10,11} -> t_start not in {0,1}\n\nWe are at y=2 at relative time t=1 (so we cannot start before t=1). \n\nWe want the smallest t_start>=1 that satisfies all these.\n\nLet's check t_start=7: we did that.\n\nBut what about t_start=7? \n  Then freeway3: t_start+5=12 -> safe.\n  freeway4: 13 -> safe.\n  etc.\n\nBut we want minimal H. We can try t_start=2? \n\nCheck t_start=2:\n  freeway3: 2+5=7 -> absolute turn7? But dangerous times are 10 and 11 -> safe.\n  freeway4: 2+6=8 -> safe.\n  freeway5: 2+7=9 -> safe.\n  freeway6: 2+8=10 -> dangerous! (absolute turn10) -> we are on freeway6 at turn10 -> collision.\n\nSo not safe.\n\nt_start=3:\n  freeway3: 3+5=8 -> safe.\n  freeway4: 3+6=9 -> safe.\n  freeway5: 3+7=10 -> dangerous! (freeway5 at turn10) -> collision.\n\nt_start=4:\n  freeway3: 4+5=9 -> safe.\n  freeway4: 4+6=10 -> dangerous! (freeway4 at turn10) -> collision.\n\nt_start=5:\n  freeway3: 5+5=10 -> dangerous! (freeway3 at turn10) -> collision.\n\nt_start=6:\n  freeway3: 6+5=11 -> dangerous! (freeway3 at turn11) -> collision.\n\nt_start=7: safe, as above.\n\nSo the earliest we can start the upward move from y=2 is at relative time t=7 (absolute turn11).\n\nTherefore, we must wait at y=2 from relative time t=1 to t=6 (6 turns: actions at t=1 to t=6 are S) and then start moving up at t=7.\n\nBut note: we start at t=0 at y=1. Then:\n\n  t=0 (absolute turn4): at y=1 -> choose U -> then at turn5: y=2.\n  t=1 (turn5): at y=2 -> choose S -> then at turn6: y=2.\n  t=2 (turn6): at y=2 -> S -> turn7: y=2.\n  t=3 (turn7): at y=2 -> S -> turn8: y=2.\n  t=4 (turn8): at y=2 -> S -> turn9: y=2.\n  t=5 (turn9): at y=2 -> S -> turn10: y=2.\n  t=6 (turn10): at y=2 -> S -> turn11: y=2.\n  t=7 (turn11): at y=2 -> choose U -> then at turn12: y=3.\n  t=8 (turn12): at y=3 -> U -> turn13: y=4.\n  t=9 (turn13): at y=4 -> U -> turn14: y=5.\n  t=10 (turn14): at y=5 -> U -> turn15: y=6.\n  t=11 (turn15): at y=6 -> U -> turn16: y=7.\n  t=12 (turn16): at y=7 -> U -> turn17: y=8.\n  t=13 (turn17): at y=8 -> U -> turn18: y=9.\n\nThen we are done at turn18. So H=14 (from t=0 to t=13, 14 actions).\n\nBut is there a faster way?\n\nAlternative: we might not go straight to y=2 and wait. We could go up to a higher safe freeway and wait there? But the only safe freeways during the dangerous times (turns10 and11) are freeway1 and freeway2.\n\nWe are currently at y=1. We can stay at y=1 for a while? But freeway1 is dangerous at turns6 and7 (absolute) which are relative t=2 and t=3.\n\nWe are at y=1 at turn4 (t=0). If we stay at y=1, then:\n  At turn5 (t=1): we are at y=1 -> check freeway1 at t=1: car3: [-17,-6] -> safe.\n  At turn6 (t=2): freeway1: car3: [-11,0] -> collision! \n\nSo we cannot stay at y=1 beyond turn5 (absolute). We must leave y=1 by turn5 at the latest? Actually, at turn5 we are safe? But at turn6 we are not.\n\nWe are at turn5: if we are at y=1 at turn5 (by having stayed at turn4) then at turn5 we are still at y=1 -> but then at turn5 (t=1) we are safe. Then we can move at turn5 to y=2.\n\nBut then at turn6 we are at y=2 -> which is safe (freeway2 at t=2: [ -11+36*2, 24+36*2] = [61,96] -> safe).\n\nBut then we are at y=2 at turn6 (t=2). Then we can wait at y=2 until t=7 (relative) and then move up? \n\nBut we still have to avoid being on freeways3-8 at turns10 and11.\n\nWe would start the upward sequence from y=2 at a time t_start>=7 as before? \n\nBut note: we are at y=2 at turn6 (absolute) which is relative t=2.\n\nThen we wait at y=2 from t=2 to t=6 (5 turns: actions at t=2,3,4,5,6: S) and then at t=7 (absolute turn11) we start moving up.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\n  t=0 (turn4): at y=1 -> choose S? -> then at turn5: y=1.\n  t=1 (turn5): at y=1 -> choose U? -> then at turn6: y=2.\n  t=2 (turn6): at y=2 -> S -> turn7: y=2.\n  t=3 (turn7): at y2 -> S -> turn8: y2.\n  t=4 (turn8): y2 -> S -> turn9: y2.\n  t=5 (turn9): y2 -> S -> turn10: y2.\n  t=6 (turn10): y2 -> S -> turn11: y2.\n  t=7 (turn11): y2 -> U -> turn12: y3.\n  ... same as before until turn18: y9.\n\nThis is 14 actions as well.\n\nBut we saved one action? No: in the first plan we had 14 actions (from t=0 to t=13). In this plan, we also have from t=0 to t=13? \n\nLet me count the actions:\n\nPlan1 (go to y2 at turn5 and wait until turn11 to start moving up):\n  Actions: \n    turn4 (t0): U\n    turn5 (t1): S\n    turn6 (t2): S\n    turn7 (t3): S\n    turn8 (t4): S\n    turn9 (t5): S\n    turn10 (t6): S\n    turn11 (t7): U\n    turn12 (t8): U\n    turn13 (t9): U\n    turn14 (t10): U\n    turn15 (t11): U\n    turn16 (t12): U\n    turn17 (t13): U\n\nSo 14 actions, and at turn17 (absolute) we are at y9? \n  At turn17: we do U -> then at the next turn (turn18) we are at y9? \n  But we need to be at y9 at the last action turn? \n\nThe problem: we do an action at turn t, and then we are at a new position at turn t+1. \n\nWe want at the last action turn, after the action, to be at y9? \n\nBut note: the player update: \n  y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t.\n\nWe do an action at turn t, and then the next state is turn t+1.\n\nWe are to reach (0,9) at the turn after the last action? \n\nThe problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} such that y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nLet me parse: \n  The sequence is from t=0 to H-1 (relative). \n  The time index for the actions: \n      t=0: action at t1 (absolute turn4)\n      t=1: action at t1+1 (turn5)\n      ...\n      t=H-1: action at t1 + H -1.\n\nThen the position after the last action: at turn (t1 + H) we are at y_{t1+H}? \n  But the problem says: we want y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9.\n\nNote: the action at time t (relative) is a_t, and it determines y_{t+1} (the next state).\n\nBut the state at the beginning of turn t1 is given: (0, y_{t1}) = (0,1).\n\nThen:\n  After action a_{t1} (at turn t1), we get y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + Delta y_{t1}.\n\nSo at the next turn (t1+1) we are at y_{t1+1}.\n\nThe sequence of actions is for turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\nAfter the last action (at turn t1+H-1), we have y_{t1+H} = y_{t1+H-1} + Delta y_{t1+H-1}.\n\nBut the problem says: we want y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9? \n\nWait, the problem states: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H - 1\"\n\nBut note: the player position at turn t is (0, y_t). \n\nWe start at turn t1: (0, y_{t1}) = (0,1).\n\nWe want at the end of the sequence (after H actions) to be at (0,9) at turn t1 + H - 1.\n\nBut the last action is taken at turn t1+H-1, and then the position at that same turn? \n\nNo, the position is updated at the next turn. \n\nActually, the problem says: \"y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t\" and the action a_t is taken at turn t. So at turn t, we are at y_t, then we choose a_t, and then at turn t+1 we are at y_{t+1}.\n\nTherefore, at the turn when we take the last action (turn t1+H-1), we are at y_{t1+H-1}. Then after the action, we are at y_{t1+H} at turn t1+H.\n\nBut the problem says: we want to be at (0,9) at turn t1 + H - 1? \n\nLet me read: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H - 1\"\n\nBut in the problem statement: \n  \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions ... to reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H - 1\"\n\nThis is a bit ambiguous. It says \"at turn t1 + H - 1\", meaning the turn index is t1+H-1.\n\nBut at turn t1+H-1, we are at position y_{t1+H-1}. And we want that to be 9.\n\nSo we require y_{t1+H-1} = 9.\n\nBut how do we achieve that? \n\nWe start at turn t1: y_{t1}=1.\n\nWe do an action at turn t1: then at turn t1+1 we are at y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + Delta.\n\nWe do an action at turn t1+1: then at turn t1+2 we are at y_{t1+2} = y_{t1+1} + Delta.\n\n...\n\nWe do an action at turn t1+H-1: then at turn t1+H we are at y_{t1+H} = y_{t1+H-1} + Delta.\n\nBut we want at turn t1+H-1 (before the last action?) to be at 9? \n\nNo, at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at y_{t1+H-1}. Then we choose an action. We do not require that the last action moves us to 9? \n\nBut the problem says: we want to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1.\n\nSo we require that at the start of turn t1+H-1, we are at y=9. Then we take an action at that turn? But that action might move us away? \n\nBut the goal is to be at (0,9) at that turn. So we don't care what we do after? \n\nBut the sequence of actions includes the action at turn t1+H-1. \n\nHowever, the problem states: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning we take actions at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\nAnd we require that at turn t1+H-1, the player is at (0,9).\n\nBut at turn t1+H-1, after we take the action a_{t1+H-1}, we move to y_{t1+H}. But the problem says we want to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1.\n\nSo we require that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at y=9? And then we take an action? But if we take an action, we might leave? \n\nBut the problem does not say we have to stay there. It only says to reach at that turn.\n\nSo we can be at y=9 at the start of turn t1+H-1, and then we take any action (it doesn't matter as long as we are there at the start).\n\nBut note: if we are at y=9 at the start of turn t1+H-1, then we have reached the goal. The action we take at that turn is part of the sequence, but it doesn't affect the fact that we are already at (0,9) at the beginning of that turn.\n\nSo we don't require to be at y=9 after the action? \n\nBut the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H - 1\". \n\nAnd at turn t1+H-1, the position is (0, y_{t1+H-1}). So we require y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nTherefore, we do not require that the last action moves us to 9; we can be at 9 at the beginning of the turn and then take an action that might move us away? But that would be odd. \n\nHowever, the problem does not specify that we must remain at 9. It only requires to reach at turn t1+H-1.\n\nBut note: the goal is (0,9) and the freeways are only 1-8, so once we are at y=9, we are safe (no cars). Even if we move down, we still were at y=9 at that turn.\n\nBut to minimize H, we want to be at y=9 at the earliest turn.\n\nSo in our first plan, we were at y=9 at turn18 (absolute). But we want to be at y=9 at the start of turn t1+H-1.\n\nIn the first plan, we had:\n\n  We are at y=9 at turn18 (absolute) at the beginning? \n\n  How did we get there? \n      At turn17 (absolute): we are at y=8. Then we choose U at turn17 -> then at turn18 we are at y=9.\n  So at the beginning of turn18, we are at y=9.\n\n  Therefore, we want turn18 to be the turn t1+H-1.\n\n  We have t1=4, so 4 + H - 1 = 18 -> H-1=14 -> H=15? \n\n  But we took actions from turn4 to turn17? That's 14 actions: turns4,5,...,17 -> 14 turns? \n\n  The actions are at turns: 4,5,6,...,17 -> that's 14 actions.\n\n  And we are at turn18 (which is 4+14) at the beginning? \n\n  The turn index for the last action is turn17 = 4 + 13? \n\n  We have: \n      t1 = 4\n      H = number of actions = 14.\n      Then the last action is at turn t1 + H - 1 = 4 + 13 = 17.\n\n  And at the beginning of turn17, we are at y=8? Then we do U and at turn18 we are at y=9. \n\n  But we require to be at y=9 at turn17 (the beginning of turn17) -> but we are not.\n\n  We are at y=9 at turn18.\n\n  Therefore, we must be at y=9 at the beginning of turn17 (if we want the last action to be at turn17).\n\n  So we must arrive at y=9 at the start of turn17.\n\n  In the plan, we arrive at turn18.\n\n  To fix: we need to be at y=9 at the start of turn17.\n\n  How? We must have been at y=9 at the start of turn17.\n\n  That means we must have moved to y=9 at turn16? \n\n  Let me re-simulate:\n\n  We are at y=8 at the start of turn16. Then we choose U at turn16 -> then at turn17 we are at y=9.\n\n  But we want to be at y=9 at the start of turn17? \n\n  So we require that at the start of turn17, we are at y=9. That means we must have gotten there at turn16 by some action.\n\n  Therefore, we must have been at y=8 at the start of turn16 and chosen U at turn16, then at turn17 we are at y=9.\n\n  But then the last action is at turn16? \n\n  We want to be at y=9 at turn17 (the start), so the action that got us there is at turn16.\n\n  Therefore, the last action in the sequence is at turn16, and then at turn17 we are at y=9.\n\n  So the turn when we are at y=9 is turn17 = t1 + H - 1.\n\n  Then 4 + H - 1 = 17 -> H-1 = 13 -> H=14.\n\n  And the actions are from turn4 to turn16 (inclusive) -> 13 actions? \n\n  But we have 14 actions in our plan? \n\n  Let me count: \n      Actions at turns: 4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16 -> 13 actions? \n\n  But our plan had 14 actions: from turn4 to turn17.\n\n  We need to adjust the plan to have 13 actions.\n\n  In our plan, we are at y=9 at turn18. We want to be at y=9 at turn17.\n\n  So we need to arrive one turn earlier.\n\n  How? We must start the upward move earlier? But we cannot because of the danger.\n\n  Alternatively, we might take a shorter path? But we are going from y=1 to y=9: 8 steps up. We also have to wait 6 turns at y=2. Total turns: 6 (wait) + 7 (up from y=2 to y=9) = 13 actions? \n\n  But note: the wait at y=2 is 6 turns, but we also have the first move to y=2.\n\n  Total actions: \n      Move from y=1 to y=2: 1 action (U at turn4).\n      Wait at y=2: 6 actions (S from turn5 to turn10) -> 6 actions.\n      Move up from y=2 to y=9: 7 actions (U from turn11 to turn17).\n\n  Total: 1+6+7 = 14 actions.\n\n  The last action is at turn17? Then we are at y=9 at turn18. But we want to be at y=9 at turn17.\n\n  So we must be at y=9 at the beginning of turn17.\n\n  That means we must have arrived at y=9 by turn16? \n\n  Therefore, we need to finish the upward moves by turn16.\n\n  How? We need to start the upward move earlier? But we cannot because of the danger at turns10 and11.\n\n  We start the upward move at turn11 (absolute) and then:\n\n      turn11: U -> turn12: y3\n      turn12: U -> turn13: y4\n      turn13: U -> turn14: y5\n      turn14: U -> turn15: y6\n      turn15: U -> turn16: y7\n      turn16: U -> turn17: y8\n      turn17: U -> turn18: y9\n\n  We are at y9 at turn18.\n\n  But we want to be at y9 at turn17.\n\n  So we need to be at y8 at turn16 and then do U at turn16 to be at y9 at turn17.\n\n  That means we need to be at y8 at the start of turn16.\n\n  Currently in the upward move, we are at y8 at turn17 (start).\n\n  To be at y8 at turn16, we need to start the upward move at turn10? \n\n  But turn10 is dangerous for freeways3-8.\n\n  If we start at turn10 (relative t=6) from y2 to y3:\n\n      turn10: U -> turn11: y3.\n      Then we are on freeway3 at turn11: absolute turn11, which is dangerous (t=7 relative) -> freeway3 at turn11: \n          Car1: [-47+6*7, -36+6*7] = [-47+42, -36+42] = [-5,6] -> includes 0 -> collision.\n\n  So we cannot.\n\n  What if we start at turn9? \n      turn9: U -> turn10: y3 -> then freeway3 at turn10: t=6 relative: \n          Car1: [-47+6*6, -36+6*6] = [-47+36, -36+36] = [-11,0] -> collision.\n\n  So we must start at turn11 or later.\n\n  Therefore, we cannot arrive at y9 before turn18.\n\n  But then how can we have y_{t1+H-1} = 9 at turn17? \n\n  We need to be at y9 at turn17. That means we must have taken an action at turn16 that moved us from y8 to y9.\n\n  So we must be at y8 at the start of turn16.\n\n  To be at y8 at turn16, we must have been at y7 at turn15 and done U at turn15, etc.\n\n  The earliest we can be at y8 is at the start of turn17 if we start at turn11.\n\n  Therefore, we cannot be at y9 until turn18.\n\n  But then we must have the last action at turn17 to move to y9 at turn18.\n\n  And then at turn17, we are at y8, not y9.\n\n  So the only way to be at y9 at turn17 is to have been at y9 at the start of turn17, which means we must have arrived by turn16.\n\n  This seems impossible with the danger constraint.\n\n  Perhaps we can use down moves? \n\n  Another idea: we go up to y=0 or y=9, but y=0 is not helpful.\n\n  Or, we go up to freeway2 and then during the danger period (turns10 and11) we are at freeway2 (safe), and then we go up as quickly as possible.\n\n  But we still need 7 steps to go from y2 to y9.\n\n  We must start the upward move at turn11 at the earliest.\n\n  So we are at:\n      turn11: at y2 -> U -> turn12: y3.\n      turn12: U -> turn13: y4.\n      turn13: U -> turn14: y5.\n      turn14: U -> turn15: y6.\n      turn15: U -> turn16: y7.\n      turn16: U -> turn17: y8.\n      turn17: U -> turn18: y9.\n\n  To be at y9 at turn17, we would need to be at y9 at the start of turn17, which means we must have gotten there by turn16.\n\n  How? If we are at y8 at turn16, then we can do U at turn16 to get to y9 at turn17.\n\n  But in the above, we are at y8 at turn17 (start) -> then we do U and at turn18 we are at y9.\n\n  To be at y8 at turn16, we need to start the upward move earlier.\n\n  But we cannot start before turn11 because of the danger.\n\n  Unless we can be at a higher freeway before turn11.\n\n  For example, if we move up quickly to y=3 before turn10, then wait at y=3? But freeway3 is dangerous at turns10 and11.\n\n  We cannot wait at freeway3 during turns10 and11.\n\n  What if we move up to freeway8 and wait there? But freeway8 is dangerous at turns10 and11.\n\n  So the only safe freeways during turns10 and11 are y=1 and y=2.\n\n  Therefore, we must be on either y=1 or y=2 at turns10 and11.\n\n  But y=1 is freeway1, which is safe at turns10 and11 ( as we checked earlier: at t=6 and7 for freeway1, it's safe).\n\n  So we could also wait at y=1 during turns10 and11.\n\n  How about this:\n\n      We are at y=1 at turn4.\n      We can move up to y=2 at some point, but then move back to y=1 to wait during the danger period.\n\n  For example:\n\n      turn4: U -> turn5: y2.\n      turn5: D -> turn6: y1.\n      turn6: S -> turn7: y1.\n      ... until turn11: then move up.\n\n  But then we save one action? No, because we did an extra down move.\n\n  Let's count the actions to get to y=2 and back to y=1: that's two actions, and then we wait at y=1 for 6 turns? \n\n  We want to be at a safe freeway during turns10 and11.\n\n  We can be at y=1 or y=2 at those turns.\n\n  We are at y=1 at turn4.\n\n  We can choose to stay at y=1 until turn5? But turn5 is safe for y=1.\n\n  turn4: S -> turn5: y1.\n  turn5: S -> turn6: y1.  -> but at turn6: freeway1: car3: [-11,0] -> collision.\n\n  So we cannot be at y=1 at turn6.\n\n  Therefore, we must leave y=1 by turn5.\n\n  turn4: U -> turn5: y2.\n  Then at turn5: we are at y2.\n\n  Then we can do at turn5: D -> turn6: y1.\n  At turn6: freeway1: collision! -> not allowed.\n\n  So we cannot be at y=1 at turn6 either.\n\n  Therefore, the only safe option is to be at y=2 during turns6 and onward until after the danger period.\n\n  So we must be at y=2 from turn5 (at least) and then wait until turn11 to start moving up.\n\n  Therefore, the only plan is the one we have.\n\n  But then we cannot be at y=9 until turn18.\n\n  And we want to be at y=9 at turn17? \n\n  So we have a contradiction.\n\n  Let me re-read the problem: \"at turn t1 + H - 1\"\n\n  We have t1=4, and we want to be at y=9 at turn (4 + H - 1).\n\n  We can be at y=9 at turn18, so 4 + H - 1 = 18 -> H-1=14 -> H=15.\n\n  Then the actions are for turns: 4,5,...,18 -> 15 actions? \n\n  But our plan has actions from turn4 to turn17 -> 14 actions, and then at turn18 we are at y=9, but we are not taking an action at turn18? \n\n  The sequence is up to turn17 (14 actions), and then at turn18 we are at y=9, but the turn18 is not part of the action sequence? \n\n  The problem: the last action is at turn t1+H-1 = 4+14-1=17.\n\n  And we want at turn17 to be at (0,9)? \n\n  In our plan, at turn17 we are at y=8, not 9.\n\n  We are at y=9 at turn18.\n\n  Therefore, we need to extend the sequence to turn18.\n\n  But then we would do an action at turn18? but the problem only requires to reach at turn t1+H-1, which would be turn17.\n\n  This is confusing.\n\n  Let me read the problem again: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9), \"\n\n  and \" at turn t1+H-1\"\n\n  So the turn when we reach is t1+H-1.\n\n  In our plan, we reach at turn18, so 4+H-1=18 -> H=15.\n\n  Then the actions are from t=0 to t=14 (H=15 actions), and the last action is at turn4+14=18? -> then turn4+H-1 = 4+15-1=18.\n\n  But then at turn18, we are at the beginning of the turn at y=9? \n\n  How do we achieve that? \n\n  In our plan, we are at y=8 at turn17 (beginning). Then we do U at turn17 -> then at turn18 we are at y=9.\n\n  So at the beginning of turn18, we are at y=9.\n\n  Therefore, we set H=15, and the actions include an action at turn18? \n\n  But turn18 = 4+14 = t1+14, and H-1=14, so the last action is at t1+14=18.\n\n  But then at turn18, we are at the beginning at y=9, and then we take an action? but we are already at the goal.\n\n  The action at turn18 can be anything, because the goal is to be at turn18 at the beginning.\n\n  So we can choose S at turn18.\n\n  Therefore, the plan is:\n\n      turn4: U\n      turn5: S\n      turn6: S\n      turn7: S\n      turn8: S\n      turn9: S\n      turn10: S\n      turn11: U\n      turn12: U\n      turn13: U\n      turn14: U\n      turn15: U\n      turn16: U\n      turn17: U   -> at turn18 we are at y=9.\n      turn18: S   -> to satisfy the action at turn18, but we are already at y=9 at the beginning of turn18.\n\n  Then the last action is at turn18, and at the beginning of turn18 we are at y=9.\n\n  This meets the requirement.\n\n  So the sequence has 15 actions.\n\n  But is there a shorter sequence? \n\n  We wait 6 turns at y=2 and then 7 turns to move up: total 13 actions, but then we have the first move to y=2 and the last action at turn18: \n      actions: 1 (initial U) + 6 (wait) + 7 (up) + 1 (final S) = 15 actions.\n\n  Alternatively, we might not need the final S if we are at y=9 at the beginning of turn18 and we don't require an action that turn? \n\n  But the problem requires a sequence of H actions, and the last action is at turn t1+H-1, and at that turn (before the action) we are at y=9.\n\n  In this case, at turn18 ( which is t1+H-1 = 4+15-1=18), we are at y=9 at the beginning, and then we do an action (e.g., S) at turn18.\n\n  So it's 15 actions.\n\n  Can we be at y=9 earlier? \n\n  For example, if we start the upward move sooner, but we can't because of the danger.\n\n  Or, if we use a different path, like going to y=0 and then up, but that would take more actions.\n\n  Therefore, the minimal H is 15.\n\n  Now, let's verify the entire plan for collisions.\n\n  We are at:\n    turn4: y=1 -> action U -> then at turn5: y=2.\n    turn5: y=2 -> action S -> turn6: y=2.\n    turn6: y=2 -> S -> turn7: y=2.\n    turn7: y=2 -> S -> turn8: y2.\n    turn8: y2 -> S -> turn9: y2.\n    turn9: y2 -> S -> turn10: y2.\n    turn10: y2 -> S -> turn11: y2.\n    turn11: y2 -> action U -> turn12: y3.\n    turn12: y3 -> U -> turn13: y4.\n    turn13: y4 -> U -> turn14: y5.\n    turn14: y5 -> U -> turn15: y6.\n    turn15: y6 -> U -> turn16: y7.\n    turn16: y7 -> U -> turn17: y8.\n    turn17: y8 -> U -> turn18: y9.\n    turn18: y9 -> action S -> turn19: y9. (but we don care)\n\n  Now, check collisions:\n\n    turn4: y=1 -> cars on freeway1: \n          Car1: [49,60] -> safe.\n          Car2: [13,24] -> safe.\n          Car3: [-23,-12] -> safe.\n\n    turn5: y=2 -> freeway2: \n          span: [-11+36*(5-4), 24+36*1] = [25,60] -> safe.\n\n    turn6: y=2 -> freeway2: [ -11+36*2, 24+36*2] = [61,96] -> safe.\n    turn7: y=2 -> [ -11+36*3, 24+36*3] = [97,132] -> safe.\n    turn8: [ -11+36*4, 24+36*4] = [133,168] -> safe.\n    turn9: [ -11+36*5, 24+36*5] = [169,204] -> safe.\n    turn10: [ -11+36*6, 24+36*6] = [205,240] -> safe.\n    turn11: y=2 -> [ -11+36*7, 24+36*7] = [241,276] -> safe.\n\n    turn12: y=3 -> freeway3:\n        Car1: [-47+6*(12-4), -36+6*8] = [-47+48, -36+48] = [1,12] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n        Car2: [1+48,12+48] = [49,60] -> safe.\n\n    turn13: y=4 -> freeway4:\n        Car1: [-47+6*(13-4), -36+6*9] = [-47+54, -36+54] = [7,18] -> safe.\n        Car2: [1+54,12+54] = [55,66] -> safe.\n\n    turn14: y=5 -> freeway5:\n        Car1: [-47+6*10, -36+60] = [13,24] -> safe.\n        Car2: [1+60,12+60] = [61,72] -> safe.\n\n    turn15: y=6 -> freeway6:\n        Car1: [-47+6*11, -36+66] = [19,30] -> safe.\n        Car2: [1+66,12+66] = [67,78] -> safe.\n\n    turn16: y=7 -> freeway7:\n        Car1: [-47+6*12, -36+72] = [25,36] -> safe.\n        Car2: [1+72,12+72] = [73,84] -> safe.\n\n    turn17: y=8 -> freeway8:\n        Car1: [-47+6*13, -36+78] = [31,42] -> safe.\n        Car2: [1+78,12+78] = [79,90] -> safe.\n\n    turn18: y=9 -> no freeway, safe.\n\n  So the plan is safe.\n\n  Therefore, the minimal H is 15.\n\n  The sequence of actions for turns 4 to 18 (absolute) is:\n\n      turn4: U\n      turn5: S\n      turn6: S\n      turn7: S\n      turn8: S\n      turn9: S\n      turn10: S\n      turn11: U\n      turn12: U\n      turn13: U\n      turn14: U\n      turn15: U\n      turn16: U\n      turn17: U\n      turn18: S   [or any action, since we are already at y=9 at the beginning of turn18]\n\n  But note: at turn18, we are at y=9 at the beginning, and we are required to provide an action. We can choose S to stay.\n\n  So the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 4: U\nTurn 5: S\nTurn 6: S\nTurn 7: S\nTurn 8: S\nTurn 9: S\nTurn 10: S\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: U\nTurn 16: U\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: S\n}\n\nBut wait, the absolute turn for the last action is 18, which is t1+H-1 = 4+15-1=18, correct.\n\nAnd the player is at (0,9) at the beginning of turn18.\n\nThis meets the requirement.\n\nBut is there a shorter sequence? For example, can we reduce the waiting time at y=2?\n\nWe had to wait from turn5 to turn11 (6 turns) because the danger is at turns10 and11, and we start moving at turn11.\n\nAt turn11 we are still at y=2, and then we move.\n\nCould we move up one step sooner? \n\nFor example, if we move at turn10 to y=3, then at turn11 we would be at y=3, and then freeway3 at turn11 is dangerous.\n\nIf we move at turn10 to y=3: then at turn10: we are at y=2 (safe) -> then action U at turn10 -> then at turn11: y=3. \n  At turn11: freeway3: car1: [-47+6*(11-4), -36+6*7] = [-47+42, -36+42] = [-5,6] -> 0 in -> collision.\n\nSo no.\n\nTherefore, the above plan is minimal in terms of waiting.\n\nThus, the minimal H is 15.\n\nFinal answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) is 15, with the sequence of actions starting at turn \\(t_1 = 4\\) as follows:\n\n- At turn 4, move up (U) to position \\((0, 2)\\) at turn 5.\n- From turns 5 to 10, stay (S) at \\(y = 2\\) to avoid collisions during the dangerous periods on freeways \\(y = 3\\) to \\(y = 8\\) at turns 10 and 11 (absolute turns 14 and 15). Freeway 2 is safe during this time.\n- Starting at turn 11, move up (U) consecutively for 7 turns to reach \\(y = 9\\) at turn 18.\n- At turn 18, the player is at \\((0, 9)\\) at the beginning of the turn, so any action (e.g., S) can be taken, but staying (S) is chosen for simplicity.\n\nThe sequence ensures no collisions:\n- Turns 4 to 11: Player is on safe freeways (1 or 2) with no car spans containing 0.\n- Turns 12 to 17: Player moves through freeways 3 to 8 after the dangerous periods (turns 10 and 11), so car spans do not contain 0.\n- Turn 18: Player is at \\(y = 9\\), with no freeway to check.\n\nThe actions are:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 4: U \\\\\nTurn 5: S \\\\\nTurn 6: S \\\\\nTurn 7: S \\\\\nTurn 8: S \\\\\nTurn 9: S \\\\\nTurn 10: S \\\\\nTurn 11: U \\\\\nTurn 12: U \\\\\nTurn 13: U \\\\\nTurn 14: U \\\\\nTurn 15: U \\\\\nTurn 16: U \\\\\nTurn 17: U \\\\\nTurn 18: S\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible without colliding with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t1=64, and I start at y=0. I can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing my y-position by +1, -1, or 0 each turn, staying within 0 to 9.\n\nCollision happens if at some turn T, I'm on a freeway y_T and there's a car on that freeway such that 0 is in its span at that turn. The car positions move over time based on their direction and speed.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the car movements. All cars are moving right, according to the table. Let me list out the cars for each freeway:\n\n- Freeway 1: three cars: (48,37,right,6), (12,1,right,6), (-24,-35,right,6)\n\nFor right-moving cars, the span at time T is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)], where t1=64 is the current turn.\n\nIn the span, for right-moving, it's [tail + s*Δt, head + s*Δt], and since head is greater than tail for right-moving? In the update, for right-moving: Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 1, (48,37,right,6), so head=48, tail=37? But 48>37, so for right-moving, head should be the front, so [τ, h] with h > τ? In the first car, h=48, τ=37, so span at t1 is [37,48]? But in the update rule, it says for right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving it was [h,τ] but all are right here.\n\nIn freeway 1, (48,37,right,6), so at t1, span is [τ, h] = [37,48]? But τ=37, h=48, so [37,48].\n\nSimilarly, (12,1,right,6) at t1: [1,12]\n\nAnd (-24,-35,right,6): [-35,-24]? Tail and head, so τ=-35, h=-24, so span [-35,-24]\n\nBut we care about when 0 is in the span, meaning the car covers position 0.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways have cars.\n\nFreeway 2: only one car (-48,-83,right,36)\n\nSo at t1, span [-83,-48] since τ=-83, h=-48, so [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nFreeway 3 to 8: each has two cars: (-48,-59,right,6) and (0,-11,right,6)\n\nFor (-48,-59,right,6), τ=-59, h=-48, so span at t1: [-59,-48]\n\n(0,-11,right,6), τ=-11, h=0, so span at t1: [-11,0]\n\nh=0, τ=-11, so [ -11, 0 ], which includes 0 at t1, but since I'm at y=0 at t1, and freeway is y=3 for this, but I'm not on freeway 3, I'm at (0,0), which is not on any freeway, freeways are y=1 to 8, so at y=0, no cars, so I'm safe at start.\n\nNow, I need to move to y=9, which is above freeway 8, I think y=9 is the goal, not a freeway.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nThe collision only on freeways y=1 to 8 when I'm on that y at turn T.\n\nAlso, when I move, at turn T, I am on y_T, and I decide action to go to y_{T+1}. But when I move, at the turn I move, I leave the current y before arriving at new y? From the note: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 in span at T but not at T+1.\"\n\nLet me read carefully.\n\n\"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd the note: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_{T} at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nThis is a bit ambiguous. Let me parse.\n\nAt turn T, you are on position y_T. You perform action a_T, which determines y_{T+1}.\n\nThe collision is checked at each turn T based on y_T and the cars on freeway y_T.\n\nIf at turn T, y_T is a freeway (1-8), and there is a car on that freeway with 0 in its span at time T, collision.\n\nNow, the note says: if you move to a different y at turn T, meaning a_T is U or D, so y_{T+1} ≠ y_T, then at turn T, you are not on y_{T+1}, so even if cars on y_{T+1} have 0 in span at T, it doesn't affect you because you are not on that freeway at turn T.\n\nBut at turn T, you are on y_T, so for y_T, if it's a freeway, you check cars on y_T.\n\nThe note is about the freeway you are moving to, not the one you are on.\n\nIt says: \"you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T\", which is obvious, since you are on y_T at turn T.\n\nAnd \"thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nMeaning, if at the moment you arrive, but since you are not on it at T, the only collision check is at the turn you are on that row.\n\nWhen you are on a freeway row at turn T, you check the cars for that row at that exact turn.\n\nIf you move to a row at turn T+1, you will be on that row at turn T+1, so you check at T+1.\n\nThe note emphasizes that even if the car on the row you are moving to has 0 in span at T, but not at T+1, you are fine because you are not on that row at T, and at T+1 it's not there.\n\nSimilarly, if you stay, you are on the same row.\n\nBut in this case, since we start at y=0, which is safe, and we need to go to y=9, safe.\n\nNow, I need to minimize the number of turns to reach y=9 from y=0, so ideally, I want to go up as fast as possible, but I have to avoid the freeways when cars are at position 0.\n\nSince the grid is only vertical, and horizontal position is always 0 for player, but cars move horizontally.\n\nThe player is at x=0 always, and cars have spans that cover certain positions.\n\nCollision if at turn T, player is on freeway k (y_T = k), and for that freeway, there is a car with 0 in its span at time T.\n\nSpan is the set of positions covered by the car, and 0 is the x-coordinate where player is.\n\nSo, for each freeway, I need to find when position 0 is occupied by a car on that row.\n\nThen, to avoid collision, when I am on that freeway at turn T, it must not be occupied at T.\n\nNow, since I start at t1=64, y=0.\n\nI need to find a sequence of actions to reach y=9.\n\ny changes by at most 1 per turn, so minimum turns is 9, if I go up every turn, but I might hit a car on some freeway.\n\nSo I need to check for each freeway k, when 0 is in the span for cars on k.\n\nLet me denote Δt = T - t1, so at time T = t1 + Δt.\n\nFor each car, the span at T is [τ + s * Δt, h + s * Δt] for right-moving cars.\n\n0 is in [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] if τ + s Δt ≤ 0 ≤ h + s Δt.\n\nSince h and τ are integers, I assume, and s, Δt integers.\n\nSimilarly for left, but all are right here.\n\nSo condition: τ + s Δt ≤ 0 ≤ h + s Δt\n\nWhich is equivalent to: -h / s ≤ Δt ≤ -τ / s? Let's solve.\n\nτ + s Δt ≤ 0 ⇒ s Δt ≤ -τ ⇒ Δt ≤ -τ / s\n\n0 ≤ h + s Δt ⇒ s Δt ≥ -h ⇒ Δt ≥ -h / s\n\nSince s > 0.\n\nSo Δt ≥ ceil( -h / s )? No, inequalities.\n\nFrom τ + s Δt ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ h + s Δt.\n\nSince Δt integer, we can find for each car the range of Δt where 0 is covered.\n\nBut τ and h may be negative or positive.\n\nLet's list all cars and find for each freeway the times when position 0 is occupied.\n\nStart with freeway 1:\n\nCars:\n\n1. (h=48, τ=37, s=6, right) so at Δt, span [37 + 6Δt, 48 + 6Δt]\n\n0 in span: 37 + 6Δt ≤ 0 ≤ 48 + 6Δt\n\nBut 37 + 6Δt ≤ 0 ⇒ 6Δt ≤ -37 ⇒ Δt ≤ -37/6 ≈ -6.166, so Δt ≤ -7 since Δt integer? No.\n\n37 + 6Δt ≤ 0 ⇒ 6Δt ≤ -37 ⇒ Δt ≤ -37/6 = -6.166, so since Δt integer, Δt ≤ -7? Let's see:\n\nIf Δt = -7, 37 + 6*(-7) = 37 - 42 = -5 ≤ 0, true\n\n0 ≤ 48 + 6*(-7) = 48 - 42 = 6, true, so 0 in [-5,6]? Span [37+6Δt, 48+6Δt], at Δt=-7: [37-42, 48-42] = [-5,6], and 0 in between, yes.\n\nAt Δt=-6: 37+6*(-6)=37-36=1, 48-36=12, [1,12], 0 not in [1,12], since 0<1.\n\n0 ≤ 1? 0 ≤ h + s Δt, at Δt=-6, h + s Δt =48 -36=12, 0≤12 true, but τ + s Δt =37-36=1 ≤0? 1≤0 false, so not satisfied.\n\nSimilarly, τ + s Δt ≤0: at Δt=-7, -5≤0 true; at Δt=-6, 1≤0 false.\n\nAnd 0 ≤ h + s Δt: at Δt=-7, 0≤6 true; at Δt=-6, 0≤12 true.\n\nBut for Δt=-6, τ + s Δt =1 >0, so 0 not ≤ τ + s Δt? The inequality is τ + s Δt ≤ 0 ≤ h + s Δt.\n\nSo both must hold.\n\nAt Δt=-7: τ + s Δt =37 -42 = -5 ≤0, and 0≤6, true.\n\nAt Δt=-6: τ + s Δt=1 ≤0? 1≤0 false, so not.\n\nNow for larger Δt: as Δt increases, τ + s Δt increases, so for Δt > -6.166, τ + s Δt >0, so τ + s Δt ≤0 false. Similarly, h + s Δt increases, but lower bound not satisfied.\n\nWhat about smaller Δt? Δt = -8: τ + s Δt =37 +6*(-8)=37-48= -11 ≤0 true, h + s Δt=48-48=0, 0≤0 true, so 0 in [-11,0], yes.\n\nSpan [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] = [-11,0] at Δt=-8.\n\n0 in it.\n\nΔt=-9: τ + s Δt=37-54= -17, h + s Δt=48-54= -6, span [-17,-6], 0 not in, since -6<0.\n\nSo for this car, 0 in span when Δt ≤ -7? Δt=-8: span [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nΔt=-7: [-5,6], 0 included.\n\nΔt=-6: [1,12], 0 not included.\n\nSo Δt from -infinity to -7? But at Δt=-8 and -7.\n\n-7 and -8.\n\nΔt = -8 and Δt = -7.\n\nBut t1=64, T = t1 + Δt, so for Δt negative, T < t1, past turns, but we are at t1 now, so for future, Δt >=0.\n\nSince we care about future turns, Δt >=0.\n\nAt Δt=0, which is T=t1=64, for this car, span [37,48], 37 to 48, 0 not in, since 0<37.\n\nSimilarly, for Δt>0, span larger, but since min is 37>0, 0 never covered for Δt>=0.\n\nSimilarly, second car on freeway 1: (h=12, τ=1, s=6, right)\n\nSpan at Δt: [1 + 6Δt, 12 + 6Δt]\n\n0 in span: 1 + 6Δt ≤ 0 ≤ 12 + 6Δt\n\n1 + 6Δt ≤ 0 ⇒ 6Δt ≤ -1 ⇒ Δt ≤ -1/6 ≈ -0.166, so Δt ≤ -1\n\nAnd 0 ≤ 12 + 6Δt, which for Δt >=0 is always true since 12>0.\n\nBut at Δt=0: [1,12], 0 not <=1? 1 +6*0=1 ≤0? 1≤0 false.\n\nΔt=-1: τ + s Δt=1 +6*(-1)=1-6=-5 ≤0 true, h + s Δt=12-6=6, 0≤6 true, span [-5,6], 0 in.\n\nΔt=-2: [1-12,12-12]= [-11,0], 0 in.\n\nΔt=0: not.\n\nSo for Δt <= -1, but future Δt>=0, so not covered.\n\nThird car on freeway 1: (h=-24, τ=-35, s=6, right)\n\nSpan: [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] = [-35 + 6Δt, -24 + 6Δt]\n\n0 in span: -35 + 6Δt ≤ 0 ≤ -24 + 6Δt\n\nFirst, -35 + 6Δt ≤ 0 ⇒ 6Δt ≤ 35 ⇒ Δt ≤ 35/6 ≈ 5.833, so Δt <=5\n\nSecond, 0 ≤ -24 + 6Δt ⇒ 6Δt >=24 ⇒ Δt >=4\n\nSo for Δt=4,5\n\nAt Δt=4: span [-35+24, -24+24] = [-11,0], 0 in\n\nΔt=5: [-35+30, -24+30] = [-5,6], 0 in\n\nΔt=6: [-35+36, -24+36] = [1,12], 0 not in [1,12]\n\nSo for freeway 1, the dangerous times are when any car has 0 covered.\n\nFrom above, for Δt>=0, only the third car covers at Δt=4 and 5.\n\nFirst and second car no cover for Δt>=0.\n\nSo freeway 1 has danger at T = t1 +4 and t1+5, i.e., turn 68 and 69.\n\nt1=64, Δt=4, T=68; Δt=5, T=69.\n\nNow freeway 2: only one car (-48,-83,right,36)\n\nh=-48? Car is (head, tail, dir, speed) = (-48, -83, right, 36)\n\nFor right-moving, span at t1: [τ, h] = [-83, -48]? τ=-83, h=-48, so [τ, h] = [-83,-48]\n\nThen at T, span [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] = [-83 + 36 Δt, -48 + 36 Δt]\n\n0 in span: -83 + 36 Δt ≤ 0 ≤ -48 + 36 Δt\n\nFirst inequality: -83 + 36 Δt ≤ 0 ⇒ 36 Δt ≤ 83 ⇒ Δt ≤ 83/36 ≈ 2.305, so Δt <=2\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -48 + 36 Δt ⇒ 36 Δt >=48 ⇒ Δt >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈1.333, so Δt >=2 since integer.\n\nΔt >= ceil(48/36) = ceil(4/3) = ceil(1.333) = 2\n\nAnd Δt <= floor(83/36) = floor(2.305) = 2? 83/36=2.305, floor is 2.\n\nSo Δt=2\n\nAt Δt=2: -83 + 72 = -11? -83 + 36*2 = -83 + 72 = -11 ≤0 true\n\n-48 + 72 = 24, 0 <=24 true, span [-11,24], 0 in.\n\nAt Δt=1: -83 +36= -47 <=0 true, -48+36= -12, 0 <= -12?

At Δt=0, 0<=0 true.\n\nBut first inequality at Δt=0: -11 +0 = -11 <=0 true, so 0 in span at Δt=0.\n\nAt Δt=0: span [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nAt Δt=1: -11+6= -5 <=0 true, 0<=6 true, span [-5,6], 0 in\n\nAt Δt=2: -11+12=1 <=0? 1<=0 false, not.\n\nSo for this car, 0 in span at Δt=0 and Δt=1.\n\nNow for freeway k=3 to 8, at each, both cars are present.\n\nSo dangerous when either car has 0 covered.\n\nFirst car covers at Δt=8,9\n\nSecond car covers at Δt=0,1\n\nSo overall for freeway k, dangerous at Δt=0,1,8,9\n\nThat is, turns T= t1 + Δt = 64,65,72,73\n\nt1=64, Δt=0: T=64, Δt=1:65, Δt=8:72, Δt=9:73\n\nNow, but at T=64, if I am on freeway k, it is dangerous, but at t1=64, I am at y=0, not on freeway, so for turn 64, y=0 safe.\n\nSimilarly, for other turns.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=0 to y=9.\n\ny must be integer, and I change by -1,0,+1 each turn.\n\nStart at turn t1=64, y=0.\n\nI perform actions at each turn to change y.\n\nLet me denote the turn sequence.\n\nLet t be the turn number, starting from t=64.\n\nAt each turn t, I am at position y_t, and I choose action a_t, which determines y_{t+1} = y_t + delta, with delta based on a_t.\n\nThen at turn t, collision check based on y_t and cars at t.\n\nTo reach y=9, I need to be at y=9 at some turn.\n\nSince I move step by step, the minimal H is at least 9 turns if I go up each time, but I might need to wait or detour.\n\nBut since I can only move vertically, and no horizontal, the only way is to go through the freeways.\n\ny=0 to y=9, so I must pass through y=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 at some points.\n\nFor each freeway row, I need to be on it at a time when it is not dangerous.\n\nThat is, for row k, when I am on it at turn t, t must not be in the dangerous times for k.\n\nNow, dangerous times for each row:\n\nFirst, freeway 1 (y=1): dangerous at t=68,69 (from earlier)\n\nt1=64, Δt=4 and 5, t=64+4=68, 64+5=69.\n\nFreeway 2 (y=2): dangerous only at t=66 (Δt=2, t=66)\n\nFreeway 3 to 8 (y=3 to 8): each dangerous at t=64,65,72,73\n\nBut t=64 and 65 are past or current? At t=64, we are at y=0, so for freeways, at t=64, if I were on y=k, it would be dangerous, but I am not, so ok.\n\nSimilarly t=65, if on y=k, dangerous.\n\nNow, I need to plan the path.\n\nI start at t=64, y=0.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nThe minimal steps: if I go up every turn, I reach y=9 at t=73? Let's see:\n\nAt t=64, y=0\n\nAfter action a_64, y_65 = y_64 + delta\n\nPosition at turn t is y_t.\n\nAt turn t=64, y_64=0\n\nI choose a_64, which sets y_65.\n\nThen at turn t=65, y_65, and so on.\n\nTo be at y=9 at turn T, for some T.\n\nMinimal T is when I go up as fast as possible.\n\nStart: t=64, y=0\n\nAfter one up: t=65, y=1\n\nt=66, y=2\n\n...\n\nIf I go up each turn:\n\nt=64, y=0\n\na_t: U, then t=65, y=1\n\na65: U, t=66, y=2\n\na66: U, t=67, y=3\n\na67: U, t=68\n</think>\n",

I have to output a sequence of actions starting from turn 65.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the car movements. All cars are moving right with various speeds. For each car, given its position at turn 65, I can find where it will be at any future turn T.\n\nThe collision condition is that at turn T, if the player is on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, if there's a car such that 0 is in its span at that turn, then collision occurs. Importantly, when you move, you're not on the new row until the next turn. So if you move from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T you're still on y, and at turn T+1 you're on y+1.\n\nThe player starts at y=1 at turn 65. I need to reach y=9.\n\ny=9 is the goal, and it's not a freeway with cars; cars are on y=1 to 8. So once I'm on y=9, I'm safe, I think. The grid has y from 0 to 9, with cars on 1 to 8. y=0 and y=9 might be safe, but the goal is to reach (0,9), so I need to be at y=9.\n\nNow, the car states are given for turn 65.\n\nLet me list all the cars for each freeway.\n\nFreeway 1: three cars:\n\n1. (h=54, τ=43, d=right, s=6) Since direction is right, for right-moving, span at T is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nThe update rule:\n\nLeft-moving: span at T = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nRight-moving: span at T = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nAnd t1=65.\n\nAlso, collision if 0 is in span(T) for the freeway y_T.\n\nAll cars here are right-moving, since d=right.\n\nFreeway 1:\n\nCar1: h=54, τ=43, d=right, s=6\n\nAt time T, span = [τ + s(T-65), h + s(T-65)] = [43 + 6(T-65), 54 + 6(T-65)]\n\nSimilarly, car2: h=18, τ=7, d=right, s=6\n\nSpan at T: [7 + 6(T-65), 18 + 6(T-65)]\n\nCar3: h=-18, τ=-29, d=right, s=6\n\nSpan at T: [-29 + 6(T-65), -18 + 6(T-65)]\n\nNow freeway 2: only one car: (-12, -47, right, 36)\n\nh=-12? Head and tail, for right-moving, head is larger, tail smaller? In the span, for right-moving, it's [τ, h] with τ < h.\n\nIn the table, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed)\n\nFor freeway 1, first car: head=54, tail=43, so since direction right, head is the front, tail is back, so τ < h.\n\nSimilarly, car2: head=18, tail=7, so τ=7, h=18.\n\nCar3: head=-18, tail=-29, so τ=-29, h=-18.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFreeway 2: car: head=-12, tail=-47? That can't be right. Head -12, tail -47, but -47 < -12, so τ=-47, h=-12? But in the tuple it's (head, tail), so for right-moving, head should be greater than tail, I think.\n\nIn car3 on freeway1, head=-18, tail=-29, -29 < -18, so tail is smaller.\n\nSimilarly here, freeway2: head=-12, tail=-47, so τ=-47, h=-12, d=right, s=36.\n\nSpan at T: [τ + s(T-65), h + s(T-65)] = [-47 + 36(T-65), -12 + 36(T-65)]\n\nNow freeway 3 to 8 all have the same cars: two cars each, (-42,-53,right,6) and (6,-5,right,6)\n\nFirst car: head=-42, tail=-53, so τ=-53, h=-42, s=6\n\nSpan at T: [-53 + 6(T-65), -42 + 6(T-65)]\n\nSecond car: head=6, tail=-5, so τ=-5, h=6, s=6? Tail -5, head 6, so τ=-5, h=6.\n\nIn the tuple it's (head, tail) = (6, -5), so since direction right, τ=-5, h=6.\n\nSimilarly for all freeways 3 to 8.\n\nNow, the player starts at y=1 at turn 65.\n\nI need to go to y=9, so I need to move up 8 rows, but I can move diagonally? No, each action changes y by +1, -1, or 0, so to go from y=1 to y=9, I need at least 8 moves up, but since I can stay or move down, the minimal turns might be more if I have to wait.\n\nBut I want minimal H, so probably I should go up as fast as possible, but I need to avoid collisions.\n\nNow, collision occurs only if at turn T, I am on a freeway y between 1 and 8, and for that freeway, there is a car with 0 in its span at that turn.\n\nSince I start at y=1, and I need to be at y=9.\n\ny=9 has no cars, so once I reach y=9, I'm done, and no collision there.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 might be safe, but I start at y=1, and need to go up, so probably not going down.\n\nNow, let me find for each freeway, when 0 is covered by a car, meaning when 0 is in the span of some car on that freeway.\n\nFor a given freeway, at time T, if there exists a car on that row such that min_span <= 0 <= max_span.\n\nThen collision if I'm on that row at that time.\n\nSince I can choose when to move, I need to avoid being on a row when 0 is occupied.\n\nNow, for each row, I can find the times when it is safe to be there, i.e., when no car has 0 in span.\n\nSince the cars move, the occupancy changes with time.\n\nLet me denote T = turn number, and t = T - 65, so t is the offset from current turn.\n\nSo at time T = 65 + t, for t >= 0.\n\nNow, for each freeway k, find for which t, the freeway k has no car with 0 in span at time 65+t.\n\nThat is, for all cars on row k, 0 is not in [min, max] of the span.\n\nSince the span moves with time.\n\nFirst, let's handle freeway 1.\n\nFreeway 1 has three cars.\n\nCar A: span at T: [43 + 6t, 54 + 6t] where t = T-65\n\n0 in span if 43 + 6t <= 0 <= 54 + 6t\n\nBut 43+6t <=0 and 0<=54+6t, since 54+6t is always positive for t>=0, because 54+6*0=54>0, so 0<=54+6t always true. Then 43+6t <=0 implies t <= -43/6 ≈ -7.166, but t>=0, so never true. So car A never has 0 in span for t>=0.\n\nSimilarly, car B: [7 + 6t, 18 + 6t]\n\n0 in span if 7+6t <=0 <=18+6t\n\n7+6t <=0 implies t <= -7/6 ≈ -1.166, not possible for t>=0.\n\n18+6t >0 always, so car B never has 0 in span.\n\nCar C: [-29 + 6t, -18 + 6t]\n\n0 in span if -29 + 6t <= 0 <= -18 + 6t\n\nWhich is -29 + 6t <= 0 and 0 <= -18 + 6t\n\nFirst inequality: -29 + 6t <=0 => 6t <=29 => t <= 29/6 ≈ 4.833\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= -18 + 6t => 6t >=18 => t >=3\n\nSo for t in [3, 4.833], approximately, but t integer since turns are integer, so t=3,4\n\nAt t=3: -29+18= -11 <=0? -11 <=0 true, 0<= -18+18=0, true, 0<=0.\n\nAt t=4: -29+24= -5 <=0 true, 0<= -18+24=6 true.\n\nAt t=5: -29+30=1 <=0? 1<=0 false, so not.\n\nSimilarly, t=2: 0 <= -18+12= -6? 0<= -6 false.\n\nSo for car C, 0 in span at t=3 and t=4.\n\nNow, are there other cars? Only these three on row 1.\n\nCar A and B never cover 0, only car C covers 0 at t=3 and t=4.\n\nSo for freeway 1, it is unsafe at t=3 and t=4 (i.e., turns 68 and 69), and safe otherwise for all t.\n\nt=3: T=68, t=4: T=69.\n\nNow freeway 2: only one car: [τ + s t, h + s t] with τ=-47, h=-12, s=36\n\nSpan: [-47 + 36t, -12 + 36t]\n\n0 in span if -47 +36t <=0 <= -12 +36t\n\nWhich is -47 +36t <=0 and 0 <= -12 +36t\n\nFirst: -47 +36t <=0 => 36t <=47 => t <= 47/36 ≈ 1.305\n\nSecond: 0 <= -12 +36t => 36t >=12 => t >= 12/36 = 1/3 ≈0.333\n\nSo for t in [0.333, 1.305], so t=1 since t integer.\n\nt=1: -47+36= -11 <=0 true, 0<= -12+36=24 true.\n\nt=0: -47 <=0 true? But 0 <= -12? 0 <= -12 false, so not at t=0.\n\nt=1: both true.\n\nt=2: -47+72=25 <=0? 25<=0 false.\n\nSo only at t=1, T=66.\n\nThus freeway 2 unsafe only at t=1 (turn 66), safe otherwise.\n\nNow freeway 3: same as 4 to 8.\n\nCars: first car: head=-42, tail=-53, d=right, s=6 → span: [-53 + 6t, -42 + 6t]\n\nSecond car: head=6, tail=-5, d=right, s=6 → span: [-5 + 6t, 6 + 6t]\n\nFor first car: 0 in span if -53+6t <=0 <= -42+6t\n\n-53+6t <=0 => 6t <=53 => t <= 53/6 ≈8.833\n\n0 <= -42+6t => 6t >=42 => t >=7\n\nSo t from 7 to 8.833, so t=7,8\n\nAt t=7: -53+42= -11 <=0 true, 0 <= -42+42=0 true.\n\nt=8: -53+48= -5 <=0 true, 0 <= -42+48=6 true.\n\nt=9: -53+54=1 <=0 false.\n\nt=6: 0 <= -42+36= -6 false.\n\nSecond car: span [-5+6t, 6+6t]\n\n0 in span if -5+6t <=0 <=6+6t\n\n-5+6t <=0 => 6t <=5 => t <= 5/6 ≈0.833\n\n0 <=6+6t always true for t>=0.\n\nSo t <=0.833, so for t=0: -5+0= -5 <=0 true, 0 <=6 true, so at t=0.\n\nt=1: -5+6=1 <=0? 1<=0 false, so not.\n\nSo second car has 0 in span only at t=0.\n\nNow for freeway 3, at time T=65+t:\n\n- At t=0 (T=65), second car has 0 in span, so unsafe.\n\n- At t=7 and t=8 (T=72,73), first car has 0 in span, unsafe.\n\n- Other times, safe? But need to check both cars.\n\nAt t=0, second car covers 0, so unsafe.\n\nAt t=1 to 6: for example t=1, first car: -53+6= -47 <=0, 0 <= -42+6= -36? 0 <= -36 false, so not covered. Second car: -5+6=1 <=0 false, so not covered. So safe.\n\nSimilarly t=2 to 6: min and max not around 0.\n\nt=7: first car covers 0, unsafe.\n\nt=8: same.\n\nt=9: first car -53+54=1, not <=0; second car -5+54=49, not, so safe.\n\nBut t=0 is unsafe.\n\nNow freeways 4 to 8 are identical to freeway 3, since same cars.\n\nIn the table, freeway 3,4,5,6,7,8 all have the same two cars: (-42,-53,right,6) and (6,-5,right,6)\n\nSo for each of these rows, the safety is the same: unsafe at t=0 (T=65), and unsafe at t=7 and t=8 (T=72,73), and safe otherwise.\n\nt=0: unsafe because of second car.\n\nt=7,8: unsafe because of first car.\n\nNow, player starts at turn 65, position y=1.\n\nAt turn 65, t=0, y=1.\n\nNow, freeway 1 is at y=1.\n\nAt t=0, is freeway 1 safe? We saw for freeway 1, only unsafe at t=3,4, so at t=0, it is safe, because only car C might cover, but at t=0, car C span [-29, -18], -29 to -18, 0 not in between, since -18<0? -18 is less than 0, so min=-29, max=-18, both negative, so 0 > max, not in span. Similarly car A and B not cover. So freeway 1 safe at t=0.\n\nBut player is on y=1 at turn 65, which is safe.\n\nNow, for other rows, at t=0, freeway 1 is safe, but freeway 2: we have unsafe at t=1 only? Freeway 2 unsafe at t=1.\n\nAt t=0, freeway 2: the car span [-47, -12], both negative, 0 not in, so safe at t=0.\n\nSimilarly, freeways 3-8: unsafe at t=0 because of second car.\n\nSpecifically, for freeways 3-8, at t=0, second car span: τ=-5, h=6, so span [-5,6], and -5 <=0<=6, yes, 0 is included, since -5 <=0 and 0<=6.\n\nSimilarly, first car at t=0: [-53,-42], not cover 0.\n\nSo for freeways 3-8, at t=0, unsafe because second car covers 0.\n\nBut player is on y=1 at t=0, which is safe.\n\nNow, I need to move to y=9.\n\nEach move, I can go up, down, or stay.\n\nSince I need to go up, and minimal turns, I should go up as much as possible, but avoid unsafe times on the rows.\n\nThe path: I start at y=1, t=0.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nThe sequence of y positions depends on actions.\n\nLet me denote the turn sequence.\n\nSet t as offset, starting from t=0: turn 65+t.\n\nPlayer y at time 65+t.\n\ny_{65} = 1.\n\nAfter action, y_{65+t} for t>=0.\n\nNow, collision at turn T if y_T is between 1 and 8, and the freeway y_T has a car with 0 in span at time T.\n\nSince cars are only on 1-8, y=0 or y=9 should be safe, but y=0 might not be reachable or necessary.\n\ny=0 is allowed, but since I start at y=1 and need to go to y=9, probably not needed.\n\nNow, to go from y=1 to y=9, with min steps, ideally I can go up every turn, so in 8 moves: at turn 65+8, y=9.\n\nBut I need to check if all intermediate positions are safe.\n\nThe position at each turn must be safe for that row at that time.\n\nSo for turn 65+t, y_{65+t} must be such that if y between 1-8, it is safe at that time.\n\nNow, let's list for each t, which rows are safe.\n\nt from 0 onwards.\n\nFirst, freeway 1 (y=1): unsafe only at t=3,4 (T=68,69)\n\nOther times safe.\n\nFreeway 2 (y=2): unsafe only at t=1 (T=66)\n\nOther times safe.\n\nFreeway 3 to 8: unsafe at t=0, and t=7,8\n\nAt t=0: unsafe\n\nt=7: unsafe\n\nt=8: unsafe\n\nOther times safe.\n\nFor example, t=1: safe for all? y=1 safe except t=3,4; y=2 unsafe only t=1; y=3-8 unsafe only t=0,7,8.\n\nAt t=1: y=1: safe (not 3 or 4)\n\ny=2: unsafe at t=1, so not safe\n\ny=3-8: unsafe only at t=0,7,8, so at t=1, safe.\n\nSimilarly, t=2: all rows safe except possibly, y=1 safe, y=2 safe (not t=1), y=3-8 safe (not t=0,7,8)\n\nt=3: y=1 unsafe, y=2 safe, y=3-8 safe (t=3 not 0,7,8)\n\nt=4: same as t=3\n\nt=5: all safe\n\nt=6: all safe\n\nt=7: y=1 safe, y=2 safe, y=3-8 unsafe\n\nt=8: same\n\nt=9: y=1 safe, y=2 safe, y=3-8 safe (t=9 not 0,7,8)\n\netc.\n\nNow, player starts at t=0, y=1.\n\nAt t=0, y=1 is safe, as we said.\n\nI need to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\ny=9 is always safe, no cars.\n\nThe minimal time might not be 8 if I have to avoid some rows at certain times.\n\nBut since I can stay or move down, I might need to wait.\n\nBut to minimize H, I should avoid waiting if possible.\n\nI need to go from y=1 to y=9 in H turns, meaning after H actions, at turn 65+H-1, I am at y=9? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence: at turn 65, before action, y=1.\n\nI take action a_{65}, then y_{66} = y_{65} + Δy, and so on.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn 65+H, y_{65+H} is set.\n\nBut the position at turn 65+H should be (0,9).\n\nThe turns: turn 65: position y=1, I take action a_{65}, which affects y_{66}\n\nThen at turn 66, I am at y_{66}, take a_{66}, and so on.\n\nAfter H actions, from t=65 to 65+H-1, I take a_{65} to a_{65+H-1}, and at turn 65+H, I am at y_{65+H}.\n\nAnd I need y_{65+H} = 9.\n\nAlso, for each turn from 65 to 65+H-1, when I am at that position, it must be safe, but at turn T, I am at y_T, and that must not collide, meaning for y_T between 1-8, it must be safe at time T.\n\nAt turn 65+H, I am at y=9, which is safe, no issue.\n\nThe collisions are checked at each turn T when I am on the grid.\n\nSo for T from 65 to 65+H-1, y_T must be safe at time T.\n\nAt T=65+H, y_T=9, safe.\n\nNow, y_T depends on previous actions.\n\nStart at T=65, y=1.\n\nAfter action a_T, y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy.\n\nTo reach y=9 from y=1, I need net +8 in y, so at least 8 up moves.\n\nThe minimal H such that after H actions, y_{65+H} =9.\n\nSince each up move increases y by 1, I need exactly 8 up moves, and possibly some stay or down moves, but down moves would require more up moves, so to minimize H, I should not use down moves, and minimize stay moves.\n\nSo ideally, 8 up moves in 8 turns: from T=65 to T=72, with y increasing each time.\n\nBut need to check if all positions are safe during the path.\n\nStart at T=65, t=0, y=1: safe, as we said.\n\nThen if I go up to y=2 at T=66.\n\nT=66, t=1, y=2: but freeway 2 is unsafe at t=1, so collision if I am on y=2 at T=66.\n\nNot good.\n\nIf I stay at y=1 at T=66.\n\nT=66, t=1, y=1: freeway 1 is safe at t=1 (only unsafe at t=3,4), so y=1 at T=66 is safe.\n\nThen I can go up later.\n\nBut I need to reach y=9 quickly.\n\nSince y=2 is unsafe at T=66, I cannot be on y=2 at that time.\n\nSimilarly, other constraints.\n\nNow, let me list the safe times for each row.\n\nFor y=1: safe for all t except t=3,4\n\nFor y=2: safe for all t except t=1\n\nFor y=3 to 8: safe for all t except t=0, t=7, t=8\n\nNow, t=0 is turn 65, t=1 turn 66, etc.\n\nI need to have a sequence of y positions from T=65 to T=65+H, with y_{65} =1, y_{65+H}=9, and for each T from 65 to 65+H-1, y_T is safe at time T.\n\nThe actions are between, but y_T is the position at turn T.\n\nNow, since y changes only when I move, but at each turn, y_T is defined.\n\nNow, to have y increase to 9.\n\nSince I start at y=1, and end at y=9, and I can only change by -1,0,+1 each step, the path must go through intermediate y.\n\nThe minimal H is at least 8, but may be more.\n\nFirst, can I do it in 8 turns? That is, from T=65 to T=72, y from 1 to 9.\n\nT=65: y=1, t=0, safe\n\nT=66: if I go to y=2, but t=1, y=2 unsafe, not possible.\n\nIf I stay at y=1 at T=66, then T=66: y=1, t=1, safe.\n\nThen T=67: I can go to y=2? T=67, t=2.\n\ny=2 at t=2: safe, since y=2 unsafe only at t=1.\n\nThen T=68: if I go to y=3, T=68, t=3.\n\ny=3 at t=3: freeway 3-8 unsafe only at t=0,7,8, so t=3 is safe for y=3.\n\nSimilarly, I can continue up.\n\nBut let's list:\n\nTurn T | t | y desired | safe?\n\nBut y depends on actions.\n\nAssume I go up as soon as possible.\n\nT=65: y=1, must be, safe.\n\nAction a_{65}: if I go up, y_{66}=2, but at T=66, y=2, t=1, unsafe.\n\nIf I stay, y_{66}=1.\n\nThen at T=66, y=1, t=1, safe.\n\nThen action a_{66}: go up to y=2? Then y_{67}=2.\n\nAt T=67, t=2, y=2: safe, since t=2 not 1.\n\nThen a_{67}: go up to y=3.\n\ny_{68}=3.\n\nAt T=68, t=3, y=3: now y=3 is freeway 3, which is unsafe at t=0,7,8? t=3 not 0,7,8, so safe.\n\nThen a_{68}: go up to y=4.\n\ny_{69}=4.\n\nT=69, t=4, y=4: safe, t=4 not 0,7,8.\n\na_{69}: go up to y=5.\n\ny_{70}=5.\n\nT=70, t=5, y=5: safe.\n\na_{70}: go up to y=6.\n\ny_{71}=6.\n\nT=71, t=6, y=6: safe.\n\na_{71}: go up to y=7.\n\ny_{72}=7.\n\nT=72, t=7, y=7: now freeway 7, which is unsafe at t=7 (since y=3-8 unsafe at t=7), so collision.\n\nNot good.\n\nAt T=71, if I don't go up, but stay or something.\n\nLet's see the sequence so far:\n\nT=65: y=1, safe\n\na_{65}: S (stay), so y_{66}=1\n\nT=66: y=1, safe (t=1)\n\na_{66}: U, y_{67}=2\n\nT=67: y=2, safe (t=2)\n\na_{67}: U, y_{68}=3\n\nT=68: y=3, safe (t=3)\n\na_{68}: U, y_{69}=4\n\nT=69: y=4, safe (t=4)\n\na_{69}: U, y_{70}=5\n\nT=70: y=5, safe (t=5)\n\na_{70}: U, y_{71}=6\n\nT=71: y=6, safe (t=6)\n\na_{71}: U, y_{72}=7\n\nT=72: y=7, t=7, unsafe for y=7\n\nProblem at T=72.\n\nIf at T=71, I stay instead of going up.\n\nThen a_{71}: S, y_{72}=6 (if I was at y=6)\n\nT=71: y=6, safe\n\na_{71}: S, so y_{72}=6\n\nThen T=72: y=6, t=7, y=6 is freeway 6, which is unsafe at t=7, so still collision.\n\nIf I go down, but that might not help.\n\nAt T=71, if I am at y=6, and I go down to y=5, but y=5 at T=72 might be unsafe? T=72, t=7, y=5, freeway 5, unsafe at t=7.\n\nAll y=3-8 unsafe at t=7.\n\nSo at T=72, any y from 3 to 8 is unsafe.\n\nSimilarly at T=73, t=8, same.\n\nBut at T=72, if I can be on y=1 or 2 or 9.\n\ny=9 not yet.\n\ny=1 at T=72: t=7, y=1 safe? y=1 unsafe only at t=3,4, so t=7 safe.\n\nSimilarly y=2 safe.\n\nBut I need to be going up, not down.\n\nIn the sequence above, at T=71, I am at y=6, which is safe.\n\nBut at T=72, if I go up to y=7, unsafe; stay y=6, unsafe; down to y=5, unsafe.\n\nSo I cannot be on y=3-8 at T=72 or T=73.\n\nT=72 and T=73 are both unsafe for y=3-8.\n\nAt T=74, t=9, safe for all.\n\nSo I need to avoid being on rows 3-8 during t=7 and t=8, i.e., turns 72 and 73.\n\nIn the path to y=9, I should be above or below during those turns.\n\nSince I start low, I might need to be below before and jump over, but rows are sequential.\n\nI could stay on y=1 or 2 during T=72 and T=73, then go up.\n\nBut I need to reach y=9.\n\nAlso, at the beginning, at T=65, y=1 safe, but if I go up to y=2 at T=66, unsafe, so I had to stay or something.\n\nIn the earlier sequence, I stayed at T=65 to avoid going to y=2 at T=66.\n\nBut I was stuck at T=72.\n\nNow, to avoid the unsafe times.\n\nThe unsafe times for the rows:\n\n- For y=1: unsafe at T=68,69 (t=3,4)\n\n- For y=2: unsafe at T=66 (t=1)\n\n- For y=3-8: unsafe at T=65 (t=0), and T=72,73 (t=7,8)\n\nT=65 is t=0.\n\nNow, at T=65, y=1 is safe, as we are.\n\nI need to plan a path where at each turn, the y position is safe.\n\nStart: T=65, y=1, safe.\n\nNow, for T=66: I cannot be on y=2, because unsafe.\n\nSo I must either be on y=1 or y=3 or lower, but y=1 is possible, or go down to y=0.\n\ny=0 is safe, no cars.\n\nSimilarly, y=9 safe.\n\nBut y=0 at T=66: if I go down from y=1 at T=65.\n\na_{65}: D, then y_{66} = 1 -1 =0.\n\nThen at T=66, y=0, which is not between 1-8, so no collision, safe.\n\nThen I can go up later.\n\nBut going down might increase the number of turns.\n\nSimilarly, I could stay at y=1 at T=66.\n\nThen at T=66, y=1, safe.\n\nThen T=67: I can go to y=2, since at T=67, t=2, y=2 safe.\n\ny_{67}=2.\n\nThen T=67: y=2, safe.\n\nNow, I need to go up to y=3, but at T=68, if I go to y=3, T=68, t=3, y=3 safe? t=3, y=3, freeway 3-8 unsafe only at t=0,7,8, so t=3 safe, yes.\n\nBut earlier at T=68, if I am on y=3, safe.\n\nThen T=69: go to y=4, safe.\n\nT=70: y=5, safe.\n\nT=71: y=6, safe.\n\nT=72: now problem, y=6 or whatever, unsafe if between 3-8.\n\nAt T=72, I must not be on y=3-8.\n\nSo possible to be on y=1,2, or 9.\n\nBut if at T=71, I am at y=6, I can go down to y=5, but y=5 at T=72 unsafe.\n\nOr stay, same.\n\nOr go up to y=7, worse.\n\nSo I need to be on y=1 or 2 before T=72.\n\nFor example, at T=71, if I am at y=2, then at T=72, I can be on y=2 or go to y=1 or y=3.\n\nBut at T=72, y=2 is safe, since y=2 unsafe only at T=66.\n\nSimilarly y=1 safe.\n\nBut y=3 unsafe at T=72.\n\nSo if at T=71, I am at y=2, then at T=72, I can stay at y=2 or go to y=1 or to y=3.\n\nBut y=3 unsafe, so I can stay or go down.\n\nThen at T=72, y=1 or 2, safe.\n\nThen after T=72, I can go up.\n\nBut I need to reach y=9.\n\nAlso, at T=73, same issue, unsafe for y=3-8.\n\nT=73, t=8, unsafe for y=3-8.\n\nAt T=74, t=9, safe.\n\nSo I need to be below y=3 during T=72 and T=73.\n\nThat is, at turn T=72 and T=73, y <=2 or y=9.\n\nBut y=9 not yet.\n\nSo y<=2.\n\nThen after that, go up.\n\nNow, back to the beginning.\n\nI need to reach a low row by T=71 or something.\n\nLet's think about the timing.\n\nI want to minimize H, so reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nThe first opportunity to be at y=9 is after 8 up moves, but we saw it conflicts.\n\nNext is at T=73, but T=73 is unsafe for y=3-8, so if I am at y=9 at T=73, it is safe, but to be at y=9 at T=73, I need to have taken actions so that y_{73}=9.\n\nSimilarly, at T=74, etc.\n\nBut let's find the earliest possible.\n\nFirst, I need to avoid the unsafe spots.\n\nSpecifically, at T=66, I cannot be on y=2.\n\nAt T=68,69, I cannot be on y=1? T=68,69 y=1 unsafe, but I might not be on it.\n\nAt T=72,73, I cannot be on y=3-8.\n\nAlso, at T=65, if I were on y=3-8, unsafe, but I start at y=1.\n\nNow, let's list possible safe positions over time.\n\nFor each turn T, the safe y positions.\n\nT=65 (t=0): y=1 safe, y=2 safe (since unsafe only at t=1? t=0 for y=2: safe, as earlier), y=3-8 unsafe (because t=0), y=0 safe, y=9 safe.\n\nBut player at y=1.\n\nSafe y: 0,1,2,9? y=9 not possible yet.\n\ny=0,1,2 are safe at T=65.\n\ny=3-8 unsafe.\n\nT=66 (t=1): y=1 safe, y=2 unsafe, y=3-8 safe (since t=1 not 0,7,8), y=0 safe, y=9 safe.\n\ny=3-8 safe at t=1? Yes, for example y=3, t=1, not unsafe time.\n\nUnsafe times for y=3-8 are t=0,7,8, so t=1 safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=1 safe except t=3,4.\n\nAt T=66, t=1:\n\n- y=1: safe\n\n- y=2: unsafe\n\n- y=3-8: safe\n\n- y=0: safe\n\n- y=9: safe\n\nT=67 (t=2): all y safe except? y=1 safe, y=2 safe, y=3-8 safe, etc. All safe at t=2.\n\nT=68 (t=3): y=1 unsafe, y=2 safe, y=3-8 safe (t=3 not 0,7,8), y=0 safe, y=9 safe.\n\nT=69 (t=4): same as T=68, y=1 unsafe, y=2 safe, y=3-8 safe, etc.\n\nT=70 (t=5): all safe\n\nT=71 (t=6): all safe\n\nT=72 (t=7): y=1 safe, y=2 safe, y=3-8 unsafe, y=0 safe, y=9 safe\n\nT=73 (t=8): same as T=72, y=1,2,0,9 safe, y=3-8 unsafe\n\nT=74 (t=9): all safe, since t=9 not unsafe for any.\n\netc.\n\nNow, I need y_{65} =1, and y_{65+H} =9 for some H.\n\nAnd for each T from 65 to 65+H-1, y_T must be safe.\n\ny_T is the position at the start of turn T, before action.\n\nIn terms of path: at T=65, y=1.\n\nI need to choose actions so that at each step, when I am at y_T, it is safe.\n\nThen I move to y_{T+1} based on action.\n\nThe position y_{T+1} will be checked at turn T+1.\n\nTo reach y=9 quickly.\n\nSince at T=72 and T=73, I cannot be on y=3-8, I must be on y=0,1,2 or 9 during those turns.\n\nBut to be on y=9, I need to have arrived earlier or at that time.\n\nSimilarly, at T=66, I cannot be on y=2.\n\nAlso, at T=68 and 69, I cannot be on y=1.\n\nBut I might not be on y=1 at that time.\n\nNow, let's find a sequence.\n\nStart T=65, y=1, safe.\n\nI need to choose a_{65}.\n\nIf I go up, y_{66}=2, but at T=66, y=2 is unsafe, so I cannot do that.\n\nIf I go down, y_{66}=0, then at T=66, y=0 safe.\n\nBut y=0 is low, I need to go up later, so it might take more turns.\n\nIf I stay, y_{66}=1, then at T=66, y=1 safe.\n\nSo probably better to stay at first.\n\nSet a_{65} = S, so y_{66} =1.\n\nT=66: y=1, safe.\n\nNow at T=66, I need to choose a_{66}.\n\nI can go up, to y=2, but at T=67, y=2 will be the position.\n\nAfter action a_{66}, y_{67} is set.\n\nAt T=66, I take action, which sets y_{67}.\n\nThen at turn T=67, I am at y_{67}, which must be safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nAt T=66, y=1.\n\na_{66}: if U, then y_{67}=2.\n\nThen at T=67, y=2, which is safe (t=2).\n\nIf D, y_{67}=0, safe but low.\n\nIf S, y_{67}=1.\n\nNow, to go up, better to go U.\n\nSo a_{66} = U, y_{67}=2.\n\nT=67: y=2, safe.\n\nNow a_{67}: I can go U to y=3.\n\nThen y_{68}=3.\n\nAt T=68, y=3, t=3, which is safe for y=3 (since not unsafe time).\n\ny=3 safe at t=3.\n\nSimilarly, a_{68}: U to y=4, y_{69}=4.\n\nT=69: y=4, t=4, safe.\n\na_{69}: U to y=5, y_{70}=5.\n\nT=70: y=5, t=5, safe.\n\na_{70}: U to y=6, y_{71}=6.\n\nT=71: y=6, t=6, safe.\n\nNow at T=71, I am at y=6.\n\nI need to choose a_{71}.\n\nIf I go U to y=7, then y_{72}=7, but at T=72, y=7 unsafe.\n\nIf I stay, y_{72}=6, at T=72 unsafe.\n\nIf I go D to y=5, y_{72}=5, at T=72 unsafe.\n\nAll bad.\n\nSo I need to not be on y=3-8 at T=71? At T=71, y=6 is safe, but the problem is at T=72.\n\nI need to be at y=2 or less by T=71, so that at T=72 I can be on y=1 or 2.\n\nBut at T=71, I am at y=6, which is high.\n\nI need to go down earlier.\n\nFor example, after reaching a certain point, go down to y=1 or 2 before T=72.\n\nBut let's see the time.\n\nT=71 is turn 71, t=6.\n\nI need to be at y<=2 by T=71.\n\nBut at T=71, if I am at y=2, then at T=72, I can stay at y=2 or go to y=1 or y=3, but y=3 unsafe, so stay or down.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut how to be at low y at T=71.\n\nFrom the beginning, I can go slower.\n\nFor example, at some point, I can stay or go down to waste time, but that increases H.\n\nSince at T=72 and T=73 are bad for middle rows, I should be on low rows during that time.\n\nBut I need to cross the middle rows at safe times.\n\nThe middle rows y=3-8 are unsafe only at T=65,72,73.\n\nT=65 is the start, I am not on them.\n\nThen safe from T=66 to T=71, and after T=73.\n\nT=66 to T=71 are safe for y=3-8.\n\nT=66: t=1, safe for y=3-8.\n\nT=67: t=2, safe.\n\nT=68: t=3, safe.\n\nT=69: t=4, safe.\n\nT=70: t=5, safe.\n\nT=71: t=6, safe.\n\nT=72: t=7, unsafe.\n\nT=73: t=8, unsafe.\n\nT=74: t=9, safe.\n\nSo the window to cross y=3-8 safely is from T=66 to T=71.\n\nAfter that, I need to be below before T=72.\n\nNow, at T=65, I am at y=1.\n\nI can go up to y=2 at T=67, as before.\n\nThen from T=67, y=2, I can go up to y=3 at T=68, etc., up to y=6 at T=71, but then stuck.\n\nFrom y=6 at T=71, I cannot go up because at T=72 I would be on y=7 unsafe, or if I stay, on y=6 unsafe.\n\nSo I need to be at a lower row by T=71.\n\nFor example, at T=71, I should be at y=2 or less.\n\nThen at T=72, I can be at y=2 or y=1, safe.\n\nSimilarly at T=73, same.\n\nThen at T=74, I can start going up again.\n\nBut I need to reach y=9.\n\nSo let's plan.\n\nFirst, from T=65 to T=71, I can go up to some point, but not too high, so that I can go down to y=2 by T=71.\n\nFor example, suppose I want to be at y=2 at T=71.\n\nThen from T=65, y=1, to T=71, y=2, net increase of 1 in 6 turns (from T=65 to T=71 is 6 turns? Let's see.\n\nT=65: start\n\nT=66: after one action\n\n...\n\nT=71: after 6 actions, y_{71} is set.\n\nNumber of actions from T=65 to set y_{71} is 6 actions (a65 to a70).\n\ny_{71} = y_{65} + sum of Δy from t=0 to 5? Actions a65 to a70 affect y66 to y71.\n\ny_{65} =1\n\nAfter a65, y66\n\nAfter a66, y67\n\n...\nAfter a70, y71\n\nSo after 6 actions, I have y71.\n\nI need y71 =2, for example.\n\nThen from y1 to y2 in 6 turns, which means I must have more down or stay moves.\n\nBut I can have some up moves to be higher and come down.\n\nBut to minimize time, I should not go up too much.\n\nSince I need to reach y9 eventually, going down might not be efficient.\n\nAnother idea: go up quickly during the safe window, but to a point where I can stay or something.\n\nBut at T=71, if I am at y=2, then I can stay at y=2 for T=72 and T=73.\n\nThen after that, go up to y9.\n\nLet's calculate the turns.\n\nFirst, at T=65: y=1\n\nI need to reach y=2 at T=71.\n\nT=71 is after 6 actions.\n\ny71 = y65 + sum_{i=0 to 5} Δy for a_{65+i}\n\ny65=1\n\ny71 =1 + sum of 6 actions.\n\nEach action Δy: U: +1, D: -1, S:0\n\nI want y71=2, so 1 + sum =2, so sum= +1, so net +1 over 6 actions.\n\nThat means, for example, 1 up and 5 stays, or 2 up 1 down 3 stays, etc., but to minimize time, I should have as many stays as possible, but I need to reach y9 later, so I should have more up moves earlier if possible.\n\nBut here, to be at y2 at T=71, I can do it with few up moves.\n\nBut let's see the path.\n\nSince the middle rows are safe from T=66 to T=71, I should cross them during that period.\n\nThe distance from y1 to y8 is 7 rows, but I start at y1.\n\nTo go from y1 to y8, I need to increase by 7.\n\nFrom T=66 to T=71, that's 6 turns: T=66 to T=71, positions at those turns.\n\nAt T=66, I can be at y something.\n\nLet's list the turns where I can be on each row.\n\nPerhaps I can go directly from y1 to y3 or something, but no, I can only change by 1 each step.\n\nSo the sequence must be consecutive.\n\nFor example, to be at y8 at some point.\n\nBut at T=72 and 73, I cannot be on y3-8, so I cannot be on y8 at those times.\n\nThe earliest I can be at y8 is at T=71, for example.\n\nT=71, t=6, y=8 safe.\n\nThen at T=72, if I go up to y9, then at T=72, y9 safe.\n\nBut I am at y8 at T=71, which is safe.\n\nThen a71: U, y72=9.\n\nThen at T=72, y=9, safe.\n\nBut at T=72, if I am on y9, it is safe, no problem.\n\nSimilarly, at T=73, I am not on the grid or something, but if I reach y9 at T=72, then for T=72, I am at y9, safe, and I don't need to do more actions, but H is the number of actions to reach.\n\nLet's see.\n\nIf at T=71, I am at y8, then a71: U, so y72=9.\n\nThen at turn T=72, I am at y9, which is the goal.\n\nAnd for turns from 65 to 71, I must have been safe.\n\nNow, at T=72, y=9, safe, so no issue for collision.\n\nThe turns to check are from 65 to 71 inclusive, since at T=72, I have reached and it is safe.\n\nThe sequence: actions from a65 to a71, 7 actions, and at T=72, y=9.\n\nH=7? From t1=65, actions a65 to a_{65+H-1}, and y_{65+H} =9.\n\nHere H=7 actions: a65 to a71, y72=9.\n\nNow, need to be at y8 at T=71.\n\ny71=8.\n\nNow, from y65=1 to y71=8, in 6 actions? y71 is set after 6 actions: a65 to a70 affect y66 to y71.\n\ny65=1\n\nAfter a65, y66\n\n...\n\nAfter a70, y71\n\nSo to have y71=8, from y65=1, net increase of 7 in 6 actions.\n\nBut each action can increase by at most 1, so maximum y71 =1 +6 =7 if all up moves, but I need y71=8, impossible.\n\ny65=1\n\nAfter 0 actions, y65=1\n\nAfter 1 action, y66 <=2\n\nAfter 2 actions, y67 <=3\n\n...\n\nAfter 6 actions, y71 <=1+6=7\n\nSo y71 <=7, cannot be 8.\n\nThus, I cannot be at y8 at T=71.\n\nThe highest I can be at T=71 is y=7.\n\nSimilarly, at T=70, y70 <=1+5=6, etc.\n\nNow, at T=71, y<=7.\n\nIf y71=7, then a71: U, y72=8.\n\nBut at T=72, y=8, which is unsafe because t=7, y=3-8 unsafe.\n\nNot good.\n\nIf y71=7, a71: S, y72=7, unsafe at T=72.\n\nOr a71: D, y72=6, unsafe.\n\nNo.\n\nSo I cannot be on y=7 at T=71 if I want to go up immediately, but I have to wait until T=74 to go up.\n\nAt T=71, if I am at y=2, for example, then I can stay at T=72 and T=73 on y=2, safe.\n\nThen at T=74, go up to y9.\n\nBut from y2 to y9, need 7 up moves, from T=74 onwards.\n\nLet's calculate.\n\nFirst, be at low row by T=71.\n\nFor example, at T=71, y=2.\n\nThen a71: S, y72=2\n\nT=72: y=2, safe\n\na72: S, y73=2\n\nT=73: y=2, safe\n\na73: U, y74=3\n\nT=74: y=3, t=9, safe\n\na74: U, y75=4\n\n...\n\nup to a80: U, y81=9\n\nBut this takes many turns.\n\nSince from T=74, I can go up continuously.\n\nTo reach y=9 from y=2, need 7 up moves, so at T=74, y=2, then after 7 actions, y_{81}=9, so H=7 actions from a73 to a79? Let's index.\n\nAt T=73, y=2.\n\nThen a73: U, y74=3\n\na74: U, y75=4\n\na75: U, y76=5\n\na76: U, y77=6\n\na77: U, y78=7\n\na78: U, y79=8\n\na79: U, y80=9\n\nThen at T=80, y=9.\n\nActions from a73 to a79, 7 actions.\n\nBut I need actions from a65 onwards.\n\nFirst, I need to be at y=2 at T=71.\n\nT=71 is after 6 actions from start.\n\ny71 = y65 + sum of Δy from a65 to a70, 6 actions.\n\ny65=1\n\ny71=2\n\nSo 1 + sum =2, sum= +1, so net +1 over 6 actions.\n\nFor example, I can have one U and five S, or two U, one D, three S, etc.\n\nTo minimize time, I should have as many S as possible, but since I need to reach the position, I can do it with one U and five S, but the U can be at any time.\n\nBut I need to ensure that at each turn, the position is safe.\n\nFor example, at T=65, y=1\n\nI can do S at a65, y66=1\n\nT=66: y=1, safe\n\nThen I can do U at a66, y67=2\n\nBut at T=67, y=2, safe\n\nThen I need to be at y=2 for T=68,69,70,71 with S actions.\n\nT=67: y=2\n\na67: S, y68=2\n\nT=68: y=2, safe (t=3, y=2 safe)\n\na68: S, y69=2\n\nT=69: y=2, safe\n\na69: S, y70=2\n\nT=70: y=2, safe\n\na70: S, y71=2\n\nT=71: y=2, safe\n\nThen as above, at T=71, y=2\n\nThen a71: S, y72=2 (T=72 safe)\n\na72: S, y73=2 (T=73 safe)\n\na73: U, y74=3\n\netc to y80=9.\n\nBut this is slow, H is large.\n\nFrom T=65 to T=71, I can go up to a higher row and come down, but that might not help.\n\nFor example, I can go up to y=3 or 4 during the safe window and then come down to y=2 by T=71.\n\nBut that requires extra moves, so net same or worse.\n\nFor instance, suppose at T=67, I go to y=3, then later come down.\n\nBut let's see if I can reach y=9 earlier.\n\nAnother idea: since at T=72 and T=73, I can be on y=1 or 2, and at T=74, I can go up, but if I can be at a high row at T=71, say y=7, then after T=73, I can go up to y=9 quickly.\n\nBut at T=71, y=7, then at T=72, I must not be on y=7, so I have to move, but moving to y=6 or 8 is unsafe, so I need to go down to y=2 before T=72, but from y=7 to y=2 in one step? Impossible, I can only change by 1.\n\nSo from T=71 at y=7, I can go down to y=6 at T=72, but y=6 unsafe at T=72.\n\nNot possible.\n\nSo the only way is to be at y=1 or 2 at T=71 and T=72, etc.\n\nThen the earliest to reach y=9 is after T=73.\n\nFor example, at T=73, I can be at y=2, then start going up.\n\nT=73: y=2\n\na73: U, y74=3\n\na74: U, y75=4\n\na75: U, y76=5\n\na76: U, y77=6\n\na77: U, y78=7\n\na78: U, y79=8\n\na79: U, y80=9\n\nSo at T=80, y=9.\n\nActions from a73 to a79, but I need actions from a65.\n\nFirst, from T=65 to T=73, I need to be at y=2 at T=73.\n\nT=73 is after 8 actions: a65 to a72 affect y66 to y73.\n\ny65=1\n\ny73 = y65 + sum of Δy from a65 to a72, 8 actions.\n\nI want y73=2, so 1 + sum =2, sum= +1 over 8 actions.\n\nSo I can have one U and seven S, for example.\n\nBut I need to be at y=2 at T=73, but I can be earlier.\n\nTo save time, I can be at y=2 earlier and stay.\n\nBut the reaching time is determined by the up moves to y9.\n\nFrom y=2, I need 7 up moves, each taking one turn, so from the time I start from y=2, it takes 7 actions to reach y=9.\n\nThe start from y=2 can be as early as possible, but I have to avoid the unsafe times.\n\nThe earliest I can be at y=2 and start going up continuously is after T=73, since during T=72 and T=73, I am on low row.\n\nAt T=73, I am at y=2, then start going up at T=74.\n\nBut I can be at y=2 earlier and stay, but when I go up, I need to cross the middle rows when safe.\n\nAfter T=73, all times are safe for middle rows, so I can go up continuously from T=74.\n\nBut the point is that from the position at T=73, I start going up.\n\nIf at T=73, I am at y=2, then I go up 7 times to y=9 at T=80.\n\nIf I can be at a higher row at T=73, I can reach faster.\n\nAt T=73, what is the highest I can be?\n\ny73 <= y65 + 8 =1+8=9, but with constraints.\n\ny65=1\n\nAfter 8 actions, y73 <=9.\n\nBut I need to be on safe positions at each turn.\n\nAt T=73, t=8, safe y are y=0,1,2,9.\n\ny=9 is possible if I reached earlier, but let's see.\n\nFor example, if I can be at y=9 at T=73, then I am done.\n\nBut to reach y=9 from y=1 in 8 actions, net +8, so all actions U, y73=9.\n\nBut need to check if all intermediate positions are safe.\n\ny65=1, safe\n\na65: U, y66=2\n\nBut at T=66, y=2, t=1, unsafe! Collision.\n\nNot possible.\n\nIf I stay at first, a65: S, y66=1\n\nT=66: y=1, safe\n\na66: U, y67=2\n\nT=67: y=2, safe\n\na67: U, y68=3\n\nT=68: y=3, t=3, safe\n\na68: U, y69=4\n\nT=69: y=4, safe\n\na69: U, y70=5\n\nT=70: y=5, safe\n\na70: U, y71=6\n\nT=71: y=6, safe\n\na71: U, y72=7\n\nT=72: y=7, t=7, unsafe for y=7\n\nCollision.\n\na71: S, y72=6, unsafe at T=72.\n\na71: D, y72=5, unsafe.\n\nSo cannot.\n\nTo avoid T=72, I need to not be on middle row at T=72.\n\nSo for example, at T=71, be at y=2, then a71: S, y72=2, safe at T=72.\n\nBut y71=2, from above, at T=71, if I am at y=2, then I can do that.\n\nIn the sequence, how to be at y=2 at T=71.\n\nFor example:\n\nT=65: y=1, safe\n\na65: S, y66=1\n\nT=66: y=1, safe\n\na66: U, y67=2\n\nT=67: y=2, safe\n\na67: S, y68=2\n\nT=68: y=2, safe (t=3)\n\na68: S, y69=2\n\nT=69: y=2, safe\n\na69: S, y70=2\n\nT=70: y=2, safe\n\na70: S, y71=2\n\nT=71: y=2, safe\n\na71: S, y72=2\n\nT=72: y=2, safe\n\na72: S, y73=2\n\nT=73: y=2, safe\n\nThen a73: U, y74=3\n\n...\n\nup to a79: U, y80=9\n\nSo at T=80, y=9.\n\nH = number of actions from a65 to a79, that's 15 actions? a65 to a79 is 15 actions, but let's count.\n\nActions: a65 to a79 inclusive is 15 actions, y from y66 to y80.\n\ny80=9.\n\nBut H is the number, so from t1=65, actions a65 to a_{65+H-1}, and y_{65+H} =9.\n\nHere y80=9, so 65+H =80, H=15.\n\nBut earlier I thought of being at y2 at T=71 with less actions.\n\nIn the above, from T=65 to T=71, I used 6 actions to go from y1 to y2 with one U and five S.\n\nBut I can have more U moves during the safe window to be higher, but then I have to come down, which takes time.\n\nFor example, suppose I go up to y=6 at T=70, then go down to y=2 at T=71.\n\nT=70: after 5 actions, y70.\n\ny65=1\n\nAfter 5 actions, y70 <=6.\n\nSet y70=6.\n\nThen from T=70 to T=71, I can go down to y=5, but at T=71, y=5, then I need to go down more to y=2 by T=71, impossible in one step.\n\nT=70: position y70\n\na70 action sets y71.\n\nIf y70=6, a70: D, y71=5\n\nThen at T=71, y=5, which is not 2, and I need to be at low row for T=72, but at T=71, y=5, then for T=72, if I go down to y=4, unsafe, etc.\n\nNot good.\n\nIf at T=70, y=3, then a70: D, y71=2.\n\nThen T=71: y=2, good.\n\nBut how to be at y=3 at T=70.\n\ny70=3.\n\nFrom y65=1, to y70=3 in 5 actions, net +2, possible.\n\nFor example:\n\nT=65: y=1\n\na65: U, but if a65: U, y66=2, but at T=66, y=2 unsafe, not possible.\n\na65: S, y66=1\n\nT=66: y=1, safe\n\na66: U, y67=2\n\nT=67: y=2, safe\n\na67: U, y68=3\n\nT=68: y=3, safe\n\na68: U, y69=4\n\nT=69: y=4, safe\n\na69: D, y70=3? If I want y70=3.\n\na69: D from y69=4, y70=3\n\nT=70: y=3, safe\n\nThen a70: D, y71=2\n\nT=71: y=2, safe\n\nThen a71: S, y72=2\n\netc.\n\nBut at T=69, I was at y=4, which is safe, then I went down to y=3 at T=70, but why.\n\nThen at T=71, y=2.\n\nThen I can stay at y=2 for T=72 and T=73.\n\nThen at T=74, go up.\n\nBut from T=70 to T=71, I went down to y=2, but I could have stayed at y=3 or something, but I need to be low for T=72.\n\nIn this case, at T=71, y=2, good.\n\nThen for going up, from T=73 at y=2, a73: U, y74=3, etc to y80=9.\n\nSame as before.\n\nTo reach y=9 faster, if I can be at a higher row at T=73.\n\nAt T=73, safe y are 0,1,2,9.\n\nIf I can be at y=9 at T=73, but as before, it's hard to reach without collision.\n\nFor example, to reach y=9 in 8 actions from start, but with collision at T=66 or T=72.\n\nIf I start later, but I have to start from T=65.\n\nAnother point: at T=65, I am at y=1, but I can go to y=0 at T=66, then from there.\n\nBut similar.\n\nPerhaps I can cross the middle rows between T=66 and T=71, and be at y=7 at T=71, then at T=74, go to y=8 and y=9.\n\nBut at T=71, y=7, then for T=72 and T=73, I need to be on low row, but I can only move to y=6 or 8, both unsafe at T=72.\n\nSo impossible to stay on middle rows during T=72,73.\n\nSo the only safe places are y=0,1,2.\n\nSo I must be on y=0,1, or 2 at T=72 and T=73.\n\nThen at T=74, I can be at y=2, for example, and go up.\n\nThe earliest I can reach y=9 is T=80, as above.\n\nBut let's see if I can be at y=2 at an earlier turn and start going up after T=73.\n\nFor example, if I am at y=2 at T=67, I can stay there until T=73, then go up at T=74.\n\nBut staying doesn't help to reach earlier.\n\nThe reaching time is when I do the last up move to y=9.\n\nSince I need 7 up moves from y=2, and each up move takes a turn, the fastest is to start from y=2 at T=73, then after 7 actions, at T=80, y=9.\n\nIf I start from y=2 earlier, I can do the up moves earlier, but during T=72 and T=73, if I am on middle rows, unsafe, so I cannot be going up during T=72 and T=73.\n\nFor example, if at T=70, I am at y=2, and I go up to y=3 at T=71.\n\nT=71: y=3, safe (t=6)\n\nThen at T=72, if I go up to y=4, but T=72, y=4 unsafe.\n\nIf I stay, y=3 unsafe.\n\nIf I go down, y=2, then at T=72, y=2 safe.\n\nSo I can go down to y=2 at T=72.\n\nBut then I waste moves.\n\nFor example:\n\nAt T=70: y=2\n\na70: U, y71=3\n\nT=71: y=3, safe\n\na71: D, y72=2  (to avoid unsafe)\n\nT=72: y=2, safe\n\na72: S, y73=2\n\nT=73: y=2, safe\n\na73: U, y74=3\n\netc.\n\nBut I used two actions to go up and down, net no progress, so worse.\n\nBetter to stay at y=2 from T=71 to T=73.\n\nIn the first plan, with being at y=2 at T=71, and staying through T=72 and T=73, then going up from T=74.\n\nNow, to be at y=2 at T=71 with minimal actions.\n\nFrom y=1 at T=65 to y=2 at T=71 in 6 actions with net +1.\n\nI can do it with one U and five S, for example.\n\nBut the U should be at a time when I can move up.\n\nFor example:\n\na65: S, y66=1  (T=66 y=1 safe)\n\na66: U, y67=2  (T=67 y=2 safe)\n\nThen a67 to a70: all S, so y68=2, y69=2, y70=2, y71=2\n\nAll safe, as before.\n\nThen a71: S, y72=2\n\na72: S, y73=2\n\na73: U, y74=3\n\na74: U, y75=4\n\na75: U, y76=5\n\na76: U, y77=6\n\na77: U, y78=7\n\na78: U, y79=8\n\na79: U, y80=9\n\nSo actions from a65 to a79, 15 actions.\n\nH=15.\n\nBut is there a way with less?\n\nSuppose I go up faster at the beginning.\n\nFor example, at T=65, I cannot go up because y=2 at T=66 unsafe, so I must stay or go down.\n\nGo down to y=0.\n\na65: D, y66=0\n\nT=66: y=0, safe\n\nThen a66: U, y67=1\n\nT=67: y=1, safe\n\na67: U, y68=2\n\nT=68: y=2, safe (t=3)\n\nBut at T=68, y=1 is unsafe, but I am at y=2, safe.\n\nThen I can go up to y=3 at T=69.\n\na68: U, y69=3\n\nT=69: y=3, safe\n\na69: U, y70=4\n\nT=70: y=4, safe\n\na70: U, y71=5\n\nT=71: y=5, safe\n\nBut now at T=71, y=5, which is not low.\n\nThen for T=72, I need to go down or something, but as before, cannot avoid collision.\n\nFrom here, at T=71, y=5, I can go down to y=4 at T=72, but unsafe.\n\nNot possible.\n\nSo I think the only way is to be at y=1 or 2 before T=72 and stay there.\n\nIn the sequence above with 15 actions, it works.\n\nBut let's confirm the car states for y=1 at later times.\n\nFor example, at T=68, y=1 is unsafe, but in the sequence, I am not on y=1 at that time.\n\nIn the first sequence, I am on y=2 at T=68, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly, no problem.\n\nPerhaps I can reach y=9 at T=74 if I am at y=7 at T=73, but at T=73, y=7 is unsafe, so I cannot be on it.\n\nAt T=73, I can only be on y=0,1,2,9.\n\nIf I can be at y=9 at T=73, that would be best, but as before, difficult.\n\nFor example, to be at y=9 at T=73, after 8 actions.\n\ny65=1, y73=9, net +8 in 8 actions, so all U.\n\nBut:\n\na65: U, y66=2, T=66 y=2 unsafe.\n\nNot possible.\n\na65: S, y66=1\n\na66: U, y67=2\n\na67: U, y68=3\n\na68: U, y69=4\n\na69: U, y70=5\n\na70: U, y71=6\n\na71: U, y72=7\n\nT=72 y=7 unsafe.\n\nCollision.\n\na71: S, but y72=6, unsafe.\n\nNo.\n\nSo cannot reach y=9 before T=80 in this setup.\n\nPerhaps at T=74, I can be at y=9.\n\ny74=9.\n\nAfter 9 actions, y74 = y65 + sum of 9 actions.\n\nNet +8, so 8 U and 1 S or something.\n\nBut with the constraints.\n\nFor example:\n\nStart T=65 y=1\n\na65: S, y66=1 (safe)\n\na66: U, y67=2 (safe)\n\na67: U, y68=3 (safe)\n\na68: U, y69=4 (safe)\n\na69: U, y70=5 (safe)\n\na70: U, y71=6 (safe)\n\na71: U, y72=7 but at T=72 y=7 unsafe, cannot.\n\nIf at a71 I do S, y72=6, unsafe at T=72.\n\nIf I do D, y72=5, unsafe.\n\nSo I cannot be on y=3-8 at T=72.\n\nSo for T=72, I must be on y=0,1,2.\n\nIn the action at T=71, if I am at y=6, I can go down to y=5, but y=5 at T=72 unsafe.\n\nUnless I go down to y=2 at T=72, but from y=6 to y=2 in one step impossible.\n\nSo I need to be at y=2 at T=71, for example.\n\nThen a71: S, y72=2, safe.\n\nThen a72: S, y73=2, safe.\n\nThen a73: U, y74=3\n\nBut to reach y=9, I need to go up from here.\n\nAt T=74, y=3, then after 6 more U moves, y80=9.\n\nSame as before.\n\nFrom T=73, if I am at y=2, a73: U, y74=3, etc.\n\nTo have y74=9, I need to be at y=9 at T=74, so from y=2 at T=73, I need to go up 7 times, but at T=74 I am at y=3, not 9.\n\nSo earliest y=9 at T=80.\n\nPerhaps I can be at y=3 at T=73, but at T=73, y=3 is unsafe, so I cannot be on it.\n\nAt T=73, only y=0,1,2,9 are safe.\n\nSo I must be on one of them.\n\nIf not y=9, then y=0,1,2.\n\nSo the highest I can be at T=73 is y=2.\n\nThen from there, it takes 7 turns to y=9.\n\nSo minimal H is 15, with the sequence as above.\n\nBut let's write the actions.\n\nFrom the beginning:\n\nTurn 65: action S (stay), so y66=1\n\nTurn 66: action U (up), y67=2\n\nTurn 67: action S, y68=2\n\nTurn 68: action S, y69=2\n\nTurn 69: action S, y70=2\n\nTurn 70: action S, y71=2\n\nTurn 71: action S, y72=2\n\nTurn 72: action S, y73=2\n\nTurn 73: action U, y74=3\n\nTurn 74: action U, y75=4\n\nTurn 75: action U, y76=5\n\nTurn 76: action U, y77=6\n\nTurn 77: action U, y78=7\n\nTurn 78: action U, y79=8\n\nTurn 79: action U, y80=9\n\nNow, at turn 80, y=9, so H=15 actions from a65 to a79.\n\nThe sequence is for turns from 65 to 79.\n\nIn the answer, it should be actions from turn 65 to turn 79, but turn 79 is a_{79}, and y_{80}=9.\n\nThe number of turns H=15.\n\nBut is there a shorter way?\n\nSuppose I go to y=0 at some point to save time, but unlikely.\n\nAnother idea: at T=65, I go down to y=0.\n\na65: D, y66=0\n\nT=66: y=0, safe\n\na66: U, y67=1\n\nT=67: y=1, safe\n\na67: U, y68=2\n\nT=68: y=2, safe\n\nThen same as before, I can go up to y=3 at T=69, but then I am at y=3 at T=69, and I need to come down for T=72, but from T=69 to T=71, I can be at higher, but then coming down takes time.\n\nFor example, at T=69, y=3, I can stay or go down.\n\nBut to be at y=2 at T=71, I can do:\n\nFrom T=69 y=3, a69: D, y70=2\n\nT=70: y=2, safe\n\na70: S, y71=2\n\nT=71: y=2\n\nThen same as before.\n\nBut I used a down move, so net less progress.\n\nIn this case, from start to T=71, I have y=2, but with more actions or same.\n\nIn the first sequence, I reached y=2 at T=67 with fewer actions, but I stayed until T=71.\n\nIn terms of reaching y=9, it's the same.\n\nI think 15 is the minimal.\n\nPerhaps I can start going up later.\n\nFor example, at T=65, stay.\n\nT=66, stay at y=1.\n\nThen at T=67, go to y=2.\n\nBut same.\n\nOr at T=65, go down to y=0, then up to y=1 at T=67, etc., slower.\n\nSo I think the sequence above is fine.\n\nNow, about the car on freeway 1 at t=3,4, but in the sequence, I am not on y=1 at that time.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nSo for the answer, the actions are:\n\nTurn 65: S\n\nTurn 66: U\n\nTurn 67: S\n\nTurn 68: S\n\nTurn 69: S\n\nTurn 70: S\n\nTurn 71: S\n\nTurn 72: S\n\nTurn 73: U\n\nTurn 74: U\n\nTurn 75: U\n\nTurn 76: U\n\nTurn 77: U\n\nTurn 78: U\n\nTurn 79: U\n\nAnd at turn 80, y=9.\n\nBut the sequence should be until the action before reaching, but here a79 is the last action.\n\nIn the box, list the actions from turn 65 to turn 79.\n\nH=15.\n\nBut let's confirm the turn numbers.\n\nCurrent turn t1=65.\n\nActions from a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H -1}\n\nHere a65 to a79, so t1 + H -1 =79, 65 + H -1 =79, so H-1=14, H=15.\n\ny_{t1 + H} = y_{80} =9.\n\nYes.\n\nPerhaps I can reduce by one.\n\nSuppose at T=73, I am at y=2, but if I could be at y=3, but cannot because unsafe.\n\nOr at T=74, if I am at y=3, but to reach y=9 faster, I need to be higher.\n\nBut at T=74, I can be at y=3, then go up to y=9 at T=80.\n\nSame.\n\nIf at T=73, I am at y=2, and at T=74 I go to y=3, etc.\n\nNo shorter.\n\nSo I think it's minimal.\n\nSo the sequence is as above.\n</think>\nTo reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 1) at turn \\(t_1 = 65\\) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the player must navigate around unsafe times for each freeway. The car movements and collision conditions dictate that:\n\n- Freeway \\(y = 1\\) is unsafe at turns 68 and 69 (\\(t = 3, 4\\)).\n- Freeway \\(y = 2\\) is unsafe at turn 66 (\\(t = 1\\)).\n- Freeways \\(y = 3\\) to \\(y = 8\\) are unsafe at turns 65 (\\(t = 0\\)), 72 (\\(t = 7\\)), and 73 (\\(t = 8\\)).\n\nThe player starts at \\(y = 1\\) at turn 65, which is safe. To minimize the number of turns \\(H\\), the player should:\n- Stay at \\(y = 1\\) or \\(y = 2\\) during unsafe times for middle freeways (turns 72 and 73).\n- Cross the middle freeways (\\(y = 3\\) to \\(y = 8\\)) only during safe windows (turns 66 to 71).\n- Reach \\(y = 9\\) as quickly as possible after turn 73.\n\nThe minimal sequence involves:\n1. Staying at \\(y = 1\\) on turn 65 to avoid moving to \\(y = 2\\) on turn 66 (unsafe).\n2. Moving to \\(y = 2\\) on turn 67 and staying there until turn 73 to avoid the unsafe middle freeways at turns 72 and 73.\n3. Moving up continuously from \\(y = 2\\) to \\(y = 9\\) starting from turn 74, as all freeways are safe after turn 73.\n\nThis requires 15 actions (turns 65 to 79) to reach \\(y = 9\\) at turn 80. The sequence of actions is:\n\n- Turn 65: Stay (S) to remain at \\(y = 1\\), safe at turn 65.\n- Turn 66: Up (U) to move to \\(y = 2\\) for turn 67, avoiding \\(y = 2\\) at turn 66 (unsafe).\n- Turns 67 to 72: Stay (S) to remain at \\(y = 2\\), safe during these turns.\n- Turn 73: Stay (S) to remain at \\(y = 2\\), safe at turn 73.\n- Turns 74 to 79: Up (U) to move from \\(y = 3\\) to \\(y = 9\\), with all positions safe during these turns.\n\nAt turn 80, the player reaches \\(y = 9\\), which is safe and the goal. No shorter sequence is possible due to the constraints and unsafe times.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 65: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 66: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 67: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 68: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 69: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 70: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 71: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 72: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 73: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 74: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 75: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 76: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 77: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 78: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 79: U \\\\ \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>We are starting at turn 68, at position (0,0). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on the freeways y=1 to 8.\n\nPlayer movement:\n  U: y += 1\n  D: y -= 1\n  S: y stays\n\nCollision condition:\n  At turn T, if the player is at y_T (which is the freeway row) and at that same turn T, there is a car on that freeway such that 0 (the x-coordinate of the player) is in the car's span at turn T.\n\nImportant: When moving from y_T to y_{T+1} at turn T, note that at turn T the player is still on row y_T. So we check for collision on row y_T at turn T. Then at turn T+1, the player is on row y_{T+1} and we check for collision on row y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nCar update:\n  For a car given at turn t1 (which is 68) with (head, tail, direction, speed):\n    For left-moving: the car moves left (negative x direction). But note: all cars in this state are right-moving (d = 'right')! So we only have right-moving cars.\n\n  Right-moving car: \n      At time t1: span = [tau, head] (since head is the front, and for right-moving, head > tail). But note the representation: \n          In the table, for freeway 1: (-42, -53, right, 6) -> but -42 > -53? Actually, if it's right-moving, the head should be greater than the tail. Here, -42 is greater than -53, so the span at t1 is [-53, -42]? \n\n      Actually, the problem states for right-moving: \n          Span(t1) = [tau, h]   -> meaning from tail to head? But note the example: (head, tail) = (36,25) for a right-moving car? That doesn't make sense because 36>25, so the car would be from 25 to 36? \n\n      But wait: the representation is (head, tail, direction, speed). For right-moving, the head is the front (rightmost) and tail is the leftmost. So the span is [tail, head]. \n\n      Therefore, for a right-moving car at turn t1: \n          span = [tail, head]\n\n      Then at turn T (>= t1), the car moves right by s*(T-t1). So:\n          new_tail = tail + s*(T-t1)\n          new_head = head + s*(T-t1)\n          span(T) = [tail + s*(T-t1), head + s*(T-t1)]\n\n  Similarly, for left-moving, but we don't have any.\n\nSo for each car on a freeway, we can compute its span at any future turn T.\n\nWe are starting at turn 68 (t1=68) at (0,0). We want to go to (0,9). We must avoid being on a freeway row (y from 1 to 8) at a turn T when 0 is in the span of any car on that row at that same turn T.\n\nNote: At turn T, we are at row y_T. We only check the cars on row y_T at turn T.\n\nWe can only move one step per turn (or stay). We start at y=0 (which is safe because there are no cars on y=0) and we need to end at y=9 (which is also safe, no cars above y=8). The danger is in rows 1 to 8.\n\nWe are to find the minimal H and a sequence of actions from turn 68 to turn 68+H-1 such that at the last turn (turn 68+H-1) we are at y=9.\n\nWe can use BFS (breadth-first search) over the state (turn, y) but note that the turn can be large? However, we are minimizing H so we can do BFS in terms of the number of steps (H). Also note that the car positions are linear in time so we can compute for each freeway and each future turn whether the car spans cover 0.\n\nBut note: the state (turn, y) might have the same y at different turns and the car positions change so the safety condition changes.\n\nAlternatively, we can precompute for each freeway k (1..8) and for each turn T (>=68) whether there is a car on freeway k at turn T such that 0 is in its span. Let danger[k][T] = True if at turn T, freeway k has a car that covers 0.\n\nThen our state is (t, y) where t is the current turn (starting at 68) and y in [0,9]. We start at (68,0) and we want to reach (t,9) for some t (minimizing t-68+1? Actually H is the number of turns, so from t0=68, we do H actions: from t=68 to t=68+H-1. So we end at turn 68+H-1).\n\nBut note: we are at (0,0) at turn 68. Then we choose an action at turn 68, which leads to turn 69 and a new y. Then at turn 69, we are at y_69 and we check danger for row y_69 at turn 69.\n\nWe can do BFS by the number of steps (which is H). We want the minimal H.\n\nHowever, since we can also move down, we might loop. But we are minimizing H, so we are looking for the shortest path. We can use BFS in the state (turn, y). The turn will increase indefinitely, but we can bound the turn: because we are going from y=0 to y=9, the minimal H without obstacles would be 9 (if we go up every turn). But with obstacles, we might have to wait (by staying or moving down) so H might be more. We can set a bound: say H_max = 100? But let's see the car speeds: the cars are moving at speeds 6 and 36. The one with speed 36 is on freeway 2. We must avoid being on freeway 2 when the car covers 0.\n\nLet's precompute the danger for each freeway and for a range of turns. Since we are starting at turn 68 and we are going to at most 68 + 100 (if we set H_max=100), we can compute for T from 68 to 168.\n\nBut note: the car positions are linear. We can compute for each car the exact intervals of turns when it covers 0.\n\nFor a car on freeway k, with (head, tail, d, s) at turn 68:\n\n  Since all are right-moving, we have:\n      tail_T = tail + s*(T-68)\n      head_T = head + s*(T-68)\n\n  The car covers 0 at turn T if:\n      tail_T <= 0 <= head_T\n\n  => tail + s*(T-68) <= 0 <= head + s*(T-68)\n\n  Solve for T:\n\n      T_min = ceil( ( -head ) / s + 68 )? Actually:\n\n      tail + s*(T-68) <= 0  => T >= ( -tail ) / s + 68   [if s>0, inequality direction remains]\n      and \n      0 <= head + s*(T-68)  => T >= ( -head ) / s + 68? Actually:\n\n        head + s*(T-68) >= 0  => T >= ( -head ) / s + 68   [if s>0]\n\n      But note: we have two conditions:\n\n        tail + s*(T-68) <= 0   -> T >= ceil( ( -tail ) / s ) + 68? Actually:\n\n          s*(T-68) <= -tail   -> T-68 >= ceil( (-tail) / s )? Not exactly: because if we have real numbers, but we have integers? The positions are integers, and s is integer, and T is integer.\n\n      Actually, we can write:\n\n        Let dT = T - 68 (nonnegative integer)\n\n        Condition: \n          tail + s * dT <= 0 <= head + s * dT\n\n        => \n          -head <= s * dT <= -tail\n\n        But note: for a right-moving car, tail < head? Actually, in the data:\n\n          Freeway 1: \n            car1: head=-42, tail=-53 -> then -head=42, -tail=53 -> condition: 42 <= s*dT <= 53 -> s=6 -> 42<=6*dT<=53 -> dT >= ceil(42/6)=7, and dT <= floor(53/6)=8 -> so dT=7,8? \n            Let me check: \n              dT=7: tail + 6*7 = -53+42 = -11, head +42 = -42+42=0 -> then 0 is in [-11,0]? Actually the span is [tail, head] = [-11,0] -> so 0 is included? -> yes, so at T=68+7=75, the car covers 0.\n              dT=8: tail=-53+48=-5, head=-42+48=6 -> [ -5, 6] -> 0 is in it.\n\n            So for car1 on freeway1: dangerous at T=75,76.\n\n          car2: (36,25,right,6): \n              Condition: -36 <= 6*dT <= -25 -> but -36 is negative and dT>=0, so the left condition is always true? Actually:\n\n                tail + s*dT <= 0 -> 25+6*dT <=0 -> dT >= ceil(-25/6)? But -25/6 is about -4.16, so ceil(-25/6) = -4? But dT>=0 -> condition 25+6*dT<=0 has no solution? Because 25+6*dT>=25>0. \n                So this car never covers 0? \n\n          car3: (0,-11,right,6): \n              Condition: tail=-11, head=0 -> \n                  Condition: -0 <= 6*dT <= 11 -> 0<=6*dT<=11 -> dT=0,1? \n                  dT=0: tail=-11, head=0 -> [ -11,0] -> 0 is in? -> at T=68, dangerous.\n                  dT=1: tail=-11+6=-5, head=0+6=6 -> [ -5,6] -> 0 in -> dangerous at T=69.\n\n          So freeway1 is dangerous at T=68,69 (from car3) and T=75,76 (from car1).\n\nNow freeway2: only one car: (-48, -83, right, 36) -> note: head=-48, tail=-83? \n      Condition: \n          tail + 36*dT <= 0 <= head + 36*dT\n          => -83+36*dT <=0 and 0<=-48+36*dT\n          => 36*dT <= 83 -> dT <= 83/36 = 2.305 -> dT<=2\n          and 36*dT >=48 -> dT>= ceil(48/36)= ceil(4/3)=2\n\n          So dT=2: \n              T=68+2=70\n              tail = -83+36*2 = -83+72 = -11\n              head = -48+72=24\n              span = [-11,24] -> 0 in -> dangerous at T=70.\n\n          Also, check dT=1: \n              tail=-83+36=-47, head=-48+36=-12 -> [-47,-12] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n          dT=0: tail=-83, head=-48 -> [-83,-48] -> 0 not in.\n\n          So freeway2 is dangerous only at T=70.\n\nFreeway3 to 8: each has two cars: \n  car1: (-24,-35,right,6)\n  car2: (24,13,right,6)\n\nFor car1 (freeway3, car1): \n      Condition: \n          -(-24) <= 6*dT <= -(-35)  -> 24<=6*dT<=35 -> dT>= ceil(24/6)=4, dT<=floor(35/6)=5 -> so dT=4,5 -> T=72,73.\n\n      Check dT=4: \n          tail=-35+24 = -11, head=-24+24=0 -> [-11,0] -> 0 in -> dangerous at T=72.\n      dT=5: tail=-35+30=-5, head=-24+30=6 -> [-5,6] -> 0 in -> dangerous at T=73.\n\nFor car2 (freeway3, car2): \n      Condition: \n          -24 <= 6*dT <= -13 -> but 6*dT>=0, and -24<=0 is always true, so we only require 6*dT<=-13? -> but 6*dT>=0 and <=-13 -> impossible? \n      Actually: \n          Condition: tail=13+6*dT <=0 -> 13+6*dT<=0 -> dT>= ceil(-13/6)=ceil(-2.166) = -2? -> no nonnegative solution? \n          and head=24+6*dT>=0 -> always true for dT>=0.\n\n      So no danger from car2.\n\nSimilarly, freeways 4 to 8 are identical to freeway3? So each freeway 3 to 8 has danger at T=72 and 73 from the first car.\n\nBut note: the cars are per freeway. So freeway3 has two cars, but we computed the first car causes danger at T=72,73. The second car doesn't cause any danger. Similarly for freeways 4,5,6,7,8: same pattern.\n\nSo we can summarize the danger for each freeway and for turns from 68 to, say, 80:\n\nFreeway 1: dangerous at T=68,69,75,76\nFreeway 2: dangerous at T=70\nFreeway 3: dangerous at T=72,73\nFreeway 4: dangerous at T=72,73\nFreeway 5: dangerous at T=72,73\nFreeway 6: dangerous at T=72,73\nFreeway 7: dangerous at T=72,73\nFreeway 8: dangerous at T=72,73\n\nNow, we are at (68,0). We want to get to y=9. We can move up, down, or stay.\n\nWe must avoid being on a freeway row at a turn when that freeway is dangerous at that turn.\n\nFor example, if at turn 68 we are at y=0 (safe) and we choose to go up (U), then at turn 69 we will be at y=1. But at turn 69, freeway1 is dangerous -> so if we are at y=1 at turn 69, we are on freeway1 and it is dangerous -> collision.\n\nTherefore, we cannot go up at turn 68? Then we must wait? But how? We can stay at y=0 at turn 68 (which is safe) and then at turn 69, we are still at y=0. Then we can try to go up at turn 69? But at turn 69, if we go up to y=1, then at turn 69 we are still at y=0 (safe) and then at turn 70 we move to y=1? But at turn 70, we are on freeway1? Then we check freeway1 at turn 70: is it dangerous? From above, freeway1 is dangerous at 68,69,75,76 -> so turn 70 is safe? Then we can be at y=1 at turn 70? \n\nBut note: when we move at turn 69: \n  At turn 69, we are at y=0 (safe). We choose action U. Then at turn 69, we are still at y=0. Then at turn 70, we update: y70 = y69 + 1 = 1. So at turn 70, we are at y=1. \n\nNow, at turn 70, we are at freeway1? Then we check freeway1 at turn70: is it dangerous? We computed freeway1 is dangerous only at 68,69,75,76 -> so 70 is safe. So that move is okay.\n\nBut then we are at y=1 at turn70. Now we want to go to y=2? Then at turn70 we choose U -> then at turn71 we will be at y=2. But at turn71, we are on freeway2? Then check freeway2 at turn71: is it dangerous? We computed freeway2 only at turn70 -> so turn71 is safe? \n\nBut note: at turn70, we are at y=1 and we choose U -> so at turn71 we are at y=2. Then at turn71, we are on freeway2? Then check freeway2 at turn71: we have only one car and we computed it dangerous only at turn70 -> so safe.\n\nThen we can go to y=2 at turn71. Then we can go to y=3 at turn72? But at turn72, we are at freeway3? And freeway3 is dangerous at turn72 -> so if we are at y=3 at turn72, we collide.\n\nTherefore, we cannot be at freeway3 at turn72. So we must avoid being at freeway3 at turn72.\n\nSimilarly, we cannot be at freeway4 at turn72, etc. until freeway8 at turn72 and 73.\n\nWe must plan to skip the dangerous turns on the freeways we step on.\n\nWe are at turn70: at y=1 (safe). \nThen turn71: we go to y=2 (safe, because freeway2 at turn71 is safe).\n\nThen at turn71 we are at y=2. Now we want to go to y=3. But if we go U at turn71, then at turn72 we are at y=3 -> and freeway3 is dangerous at turn72 -> collision.\n\nSo we must avoid being at y=3 at turn72. How? We can wait at y=2 for one turn? Then:\n  At turn71: we are at y=2. Instead of going up, we stay (S) at turn71. Then at turn72, we are still at y=2. Now at turn72, freeway2? But freeway2 is at y=2? Then we check freeway2 at turn72: safe? Yes, because freeway2 is only dangerous at turn70. So safe.\n\n  Then at turn72, we are at y=2. Now we can go up at turn72? Then at turn73 we are at y=3. But at turn73, freeway3 is dangerous? So we collide at freeway3 at turn73.\n\nAlternatively, at turn72 we stay at y=2 again? Then at turn73 we are still at y=2 -> safe? Then at turn73, we go up to y=3? Then at turn74 we are at y=3. Now at turn74, freeway3: we computed dangerous only at 72,73 -> so turn74 is safe. \n\nSo that works: \n  turn71: at y=2 -> choose S (stay)\n  turn72: still at y=2 -> choose S again? Then at the end of turn72 we are at y=2. Then at turn73: we choose U -> then at turn74 we are at y=3.\n\nBut we can also move up at turn72? Then at turn73 we are at y=3 -> but freeway3 at turn73 is dangerous -> so we must avoid that.\n\nSo we have to wait at y=2 until turn73? Then at turn73 we go up to y=3 and at turn74 we are at y=3 (safe).\n\nBut note: we are at turn71: y=2. Then we do two stays: at turn71: S (so we are at y=2 at turn72) and then at turn72: S again (so we are at y=2 at turn73). Then at turn73: we choose U -> then at turn74 we are at y=3.\n\nBut is there a way to go faster? We are at y=2 at turn71. If we go up at turn71, we get to y=3 at turn72 -> which is dangerous. So we must wait at least one turn? Actually, we must avoid freeway3 at turn72 and turn73. So we can be at y=3 only at turn74 or later.\n\nBut note: we are at y=2 at turn71. The next freeway is y=3. We can only go to y=3 at turn72 if we choose U at turn71 -> but that is dangerous. So we must wait at y=2 until turn73? Then at turn73 we choose U -> then at turn74 we are at y=3.\n\nSo the minimal waiting: we skip turn72 and turn73? Actually, we can leave y=2 at turn73 (by going up) and then at turn74 we are at y=3.\n\nBut what about the next freeways? freeway4 to freeway8 are all dangerous at turn72 and 73. So we have the same problem: we must avoid being on freeway4 at turn72 and turn73, similarly for 5,6,7,8.\n\nSo we must wait at each freeway? But note: we can move through multiple freeways? Actually, we move one row per turn. So we will be on freeway3 at one turn, then freeway4 at the next, etc.\n\nBut the dangerous turns for all freeways 3-8 are the same: 72 and 73. So if we can avoid being on any of these freeways at turns 72 and 73, then we can proceed.\n\nHow? \n\nWe are at y=2 at turn71. We can go up at turn71? -> then at turn72 we are at y=3 -> dangerous (freeway3 at turn72). So we must not go up at turn71.\n\nWe can stay at y=2 for two turns? Then at turn72: we are at y=2 (safe) and at turn73: we are still at y=2 (safe). Then at turn73 we go up: at turn74 we are at y=3 (freeway3 at turn74: safe). Then at turn74 we go up: at turn75 we are at y=4 (freeway4 at turn75: safe? because freeway4 is dangerous only at 72,73 -> turn75 is safe). Similarly, we can go up to y=5 at turn76, y=6 at turn77, y=7 at turn78, y=8 at turn79, and then y=9 at turn80.\n\nBut wait: at turn75, freeway1 is dangerous? But we are at y=4 at turn75 -> so we don't care about freeway1? We only care about the freeway we are on.\n\nBut note: freeway1 is at y=1. We are at y=4 at turn75 -> safe.\n\nHowever, when we are at y=1 at turn70, we were safe. Then we went to y=2 at turn71. Then we stayed at y=2 for two turns (turn71 and turn72) and then at turn73 we went to y=3 at turn74? Actually, the movement:\n\n  turn68: start at y0=0 -> choose S? But we want to minimize H. Alternatively, we can go up at turn68? But then at turn69 we are at y=1 -> and freeway1 at turn69 is dangerous -> so we cannot.\n\n  So we must wait at y=0 for at least one turn? \n\n  Let me try:\n\n      turn68: at y=0 -> choose S -> then at turn69: still at y=0 -> safe? Then at turn69: choose U -> then at turn70: y=1 -> and freeway1 at turn70: safe (because danger only at 68,69,75,76 -> turn70 is safe).\n\n      Then turn70: at y=1 -> choose U -> then at turn71: y=2 -> safe (freeway2 at turn71: safe, because danger only at turn70).\n\n      Then turn71: at y=2 -> we must avoid going to y=3 at turn72 (because freeway3 at turn72: dangerous). So we choose S at turn71 -> then at turn72: y=2 -> safe (freeway2 at turn72: safe? because freeway2 only dangerous at turn70 -> yes).\n\n      Then turn72: we are at y=2 -> we choose S again? Then at turn73: still at y=2 -> safe.\n\n      Then turn73: we choose U -> then at turn74: y=3 -> safe (freeway3 at turn74: not dangerous, because dangerous only at 72,73).\n\n      Then we can go up every turn until we reach y=9.\n\n      The moves:\n\n        turn68: S\n        turn69: U\n        turn70: U\n        turn71: S\n        turn72: S\n        turn73: U\n        turn74: U -> y=4\n        turn75: U -> y=5\n        turn76: U -> y=6\n        turn77: U -> y=7\n        turn78: U -> y=8\n        turn79: U -> y=9 -> done.\n\n      So H = 12? Because from turn68 to turn79: 12 turns? Actually:\n\n        turn68: step0 -> we are at y0=0 (start) and we choose an action for turn68.\n        Then we do 12 actions: from turn68 to turn79.\n\n        The last action is at turn79: U -> then at turn80? we are at y=9? \n\n        Actually, the update: \n          at turn68: action -> then at turn69 we have y69 = y68 + delta.\n          We start at turn68: y68=0.\n\n          turn68: S -> y69=0\n          turn69: U -> y70=1\n          turn70: U -> y71=2\n          turn71: S -> y72=2\n          turn72: S -> y73=2\n          turn73: U -> y74=3\n          turn74: U -> y75=4\n          turn75: U -> y76=5\n          turn76: U -> y77=6\n          turn77: U -> y78=7\n          turn78: U -> y79=8\n          turn79: U -> y80=9\n\n        So we reach y=9 at turn80. The number of actions is 12 (from turn68 to turn79, inclusive: 12 turns). H=12.\n\n        But note: we start at turn68 and we do H actions: the last action is at turn68+H-1. We want y_{68+H-1}=9.\n\n        Here, 68+12-1 = 79 -> but at turn79 we are at y79=8? Then at turn80 we are at y80=9, but turn80 is not the result of an action at turn79? \n\n        Actually, the state at turn t is after the action of turn t-1? \n\n        Let me reexamine:\n\n          At turn t1 (68), we are at (0,0). Then we choose an action a_{68} for turn68. Then we update to turn69: \n              y_{69} = y_{68} + Delta(a_{68})\n\n          So after the first action (at turn68) we get y69.\n\n          Then at turn69 we choose a_{69}, and we get y70.\n\n          We want to be at y=9 at turn T. The last action is at turn T-1, which gives y_T.\n\n          We want y_{t1 + H} = 9? \n\n          Actually, the problem says: we have a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}. Then the position after H actions is:\n\n            y_{t1+H} = y_{t1} + sum_{t=0}^{H-1} Delta(a_{t1+t})\n\n          We start at t1: y_{t1}=0.\n\n          We want y_{t1+H} = 9.\n\n          So the number of actions is H, and we end at turn t1+H.\n\n          In our sequence:\n\n            H=12: then we end at turn68+12=80. And we want y80=9.\n\n          How do we get y80=9? \n\n          We have:\n            turn68: action -> leads to y69\n            ...\n            turn79: action -> leads to y80.\n\n          So we need 12 actions: from turn68 to turn79.\n\n        Therefore, the sequence:\n\n          Turn68: S\n          Turn69: U\n          Turn70: U\n          Turn71: S\n          Turn72: S\n          Turn73: U\n          Turn74: U\n          Turn75: U\n          Turn76: U\n          Turn77: U\n          Turn78: U\n          Turn79: U\n\n        Then at turn80 we are at y=9.\n\n        But let me check the collisions:\n\n          turn68: at y=0 -> safe (no car check)\n          turn69: at y=0 -> safe (we did S at turn68, so at turn69 we are at y=0 -> not on freeway? freeways are 1..8 -> so safe)\n\n          turn70: we are at y=1 -> freeway1 at turn70: safe (danger only at 68,69,75,76) -> safe.\n\n          turn71: we are at y=2 -> freeway2 at turn71: safe (danger only at 70) -> safe.\n\n          turn72: we are at y=2 -> freeway2 at turn72: safe -> safe.\n\n          turn73: we are at y=2 -> freeway2 at turn73: safe -> safe.\n\n          turn74: we are at y=3 -> freeway3 at turn74: safe (danger only at 72,73) -> safe.\n\n          turn75: y=4 -> freeway4 at turn75: safe (danger only 72,73) -> safe.\n\n          turn76: y=5 -> freeway5 at turn76: safe -> safe.\n\n          turn77: y=6 -> freeway6 at turn77: safe.\n\n          turn78: y=7 -> freeway7 at turn78: safe.\n\n          turn79: y=8 -> freeway8 at turn79: safe (danger only 72,73) -> safe.\n\n          turn80: y=9 -> safe.\n\n        So this sequence works.\n\n        But is there a faster way? \n\n        We started at turn68 at y=0. We ended at turn80 at y=9. Total turns: 12.\n\n        Minimal without obstacles: 9 moves (all U). But we had to wait 3 times: at turn68 (S), at turn71 (S), and at turn72 (S) -> 3 extra turns.\n\n        Can we avoid one of these waits?\n\n        We had to avoid being at freeway1 at turn69 -> so we had to wait at y=0 at turn68 (by staying) so that we go to y=1 at turn70 (safe). Then we had to avoid freeway3 at turn72 and 73 -> so we waited at y=2 at turn71 and turn72. \n\n        But note: we could have gone down at some point? \n\n        Alternatively, at turn68 we go down? But we are at y=0 -> if we go down, we stay at y=0 (because the grid bounds) -> same as staying.\n\n        Or, at turn71: instead of staying, we could go down? Then we go to y=1 at turn72. But at turn72, freeway1: is it dangerous? At turn72, freeway1: we computed dangerous at 68,69,75,76 -> so turn72 is safe. Then at turn72 we are at y=1. Then at turn73 we can go up to y=2 -> then at turn74 we are at y=3? \n\n        Then the moves:\n\n          turn68: S (wait at y=0) -> y69=0.\n          turn69: U -> y70=1.\n          turn70: U -> y71=2.\n          turn71: D -> then y72=1.\n          turn72: U -> y73=2.\n          turn73: U -> y74=3.\n          then same as before: U every turn until y=9 at turn81? \n\n        That takes 13 actions: from turn68 to turn80 -> then at turn81 we are at y=9? \n\n        So that is worse.\n\n        Alternatively, after turn71: we stay at y=2 at turn71 (so we do S) and then at turn72 we go down to y=1? Then at turn73 we are at y=1 -> then we can go up? \n\n          turn68: S -> y69=0\n          turn69: U -> y70=1\n          turn70: U -> y71=2\n          turn71: S -> y72=2\n          turn72: D -> y73=1\n          turn73: U -> y74=2\n          turn74: U -> y75=3 -> then freeway3 at turn75: safe? yes, because danger only 72,73 -> so safe.\n          then U every turn: \n            turn75: U -> y76=4\n            ... until turn81: U -> y82=9? \n\n        That is 14 actions.\n\n        So our original 12-action sequence is better.\n\n        But can we avoid the wait at turn68? \n\n        We cannot go up at turn68 because then at turn69 we are at y=1 -> and freeway1 at turn69 is dangerous.\n\n        So we must not be at y=1 at turn69. Therefore, we must not move up at turn68.\n\n        Similarly, we must avoid being at freeway3 at turn72 and 73. We are at y=2 at turn71. The next move at turn71: if we go up, we are at y=3 at turn72 -> dangerous. So we must not go up at turn71. \n\n        Then we have to do something else: either stay or go down. If we stay at turn71, we are at y=2 at turn72. Then at turn72 we cannot go up because then we are at y=3 at turn73 -> and freeway3 is dangerous at turn73? But wait: at turn73, freeway3 is dangerous -> so we must not be at y=3 at turn73. \n\n        But if we go up at turn72, we are at y=3 at turn73 -> dangerous. So we must not go up at turn72 either. Then we have to wait at turn72 (by staying or going down). \n\n        Then at turn72 we stay at y=2 -> then at turn73 we are at y=2. Then we can go up at turn73 to y=3 at turn74 -> safe.\n\n        So we must have two waits at y=2: turn71 and turn72.\n\n        Therefore, the minimal H is 12.\n\n        But note: we have freeway1 at turn75 and 76: dangerous. But we are at y=4 at turn75 and y=5 at turn76 -> so not on freeway1 -> safe.\n\n        So the sequence we have is valid.\n\n        Therefore, we output:\n\n          Turn68: S\n          Turn69: U\n          Turn70: U\n          Turn71: S\n          Turn72: S\n          Turn73: U\n          Turn74: U\n          Turn75: U\n          Turn76: U\n          Turn77: U\n          Turn78: U\n          Turn79: U\n\n        But note: after turn79:U, we get y80=9. And we are done.\n\n        However, we must make sure that we don't collide at any step.\n\n        We already checked the freeways we are on at each turn:\n\n          turn68: y68=0 -> safe (we are at turn68, but we are not on any freeway? Actually, freeways are for y=1..8. At y=0, we don't check cars -> safe.\n          turn69: y69=0 -> safe.\n          turn70: y70=1 -> freeway1: danger at 68,69,75,76 -> turn70 safe.\n          turn71: y71=2 -> freeway2: danger only at 70 -> turn71 safe.\n          turn72: y72=2 -> freeway2: safe.\n          turn73: y73=2 -> freeway2: safe.\n          turn74: y74=3 -> freeway3: danger at 72,73 -> turn74 safe.\n          turn75: y75=4 -> freeway4: danger at 72,73 -> turn75 safe.\n          turn76: y76=5 -> freeway5: safe (danger only 72,73) -> safe.\n          turn77: y77=6 -> freeway6: safe.\n          turn78: y78=7 -> freeway7: safe.\n          turn79: y79=8 -> freeway8: safe (danger only 72,73) -> safe.\n\n        And turn80: we are at y=9 -> safe.\n\n        So it works.\n\n        Therefore, the answer is:\n\n          Turn68: S\n          Turn69: U\n          Turn70: U\n          Turn71: S\n          Turn72: S\n          Turn73: U\n          Turn74: U\n          Turn75: U\n          Turn76: U\n          Turn77: U\n          Turn78: U\n          Turn79: U\n\n        H=12.\n\n        But note: the problem says to output the actions from turn68 to turn68+H-1, which is turn79.\n\n        So we output:\n\n          Turn 68: S\n          Turn 69: U\n          Turn 70: U\n          Turn 71: S\n          Turn 72: S\n          Turn 73: U\n          Turn 74: U\n          Turn 75: U\n          Turn 76: U\n          Turn 77: U\n          Turn 78: U\n          Turn 79: U\n\n        But let me check if we can do it in 11? \n\n        Minimal without obstacles: 9. But we have to avoid two dangerous periods: \n          - freeway1 at turn69: we have to delay the move to freeway1 by one turn (so we started at turn68 and we had to do S at turn68, then U at turn69 -> so we arrive at freeway1 at turn70: that is one extra turn).\n          - freeway3 at turn72: we are at freeway2 at turn71. We cannot move to freeway3 at turn72 (because then we are there at turn72) -> so we have to wait until turn73 to move? But then we move at turn73: then we are at freeway3 at turn74. That is two extra turns? \n\n        Actually, we had to wait two turns at freeway2 (turns71 and 72) to skip the dangerous turns 72 and 73 for freeway3.\n\n        But note: the dangerous period for freeway3 is two consecutive turns. We must avoid being at freeway3 at either turn. So we must skip both. We can only leave freeway2 at turn73 (to freeway3 at turn74) -> that is two turns of waiting at freeway2.\n\n        Therefore, total extra turns: 1 (for freeway1) + 2 (for freeways3-8) = 3, so 9+3=12.\n\n        Is there a way to combine the waits? \n\n        For example, if we could have waited at y=0 for two turns, then we might avoid the freeway1 danger and then have a faster path? But the freeway1 danger at turn69 is only one turn? And we avoided it by one wait. The freeway3 danger is two turns and we avoided it by two waits. \n\n        Alternatively, we might go faster through the freeways? But we can only move one row per turn.\n\n        Therefore, 12 is minimal.\n\n        So we output the sequence.\n\n        But note: the car on freeway2: we are at freeway2 at turn71 and turn72 and turn73. We are safe because freeway2 is only dangerous at turn70. \n\n        And for freeway1: we are at freeway1 only at turn70 -> safe.\n\n        For freeway3: we are there at turn74 -> safe.\n\n        So we are good.\n\n        Write the answer in the boxed format.\n\n        Note: the current turn is t1=68.\n\n        So:\n\n          Turn 68: S\n          Turn 69: U\n          Turn 70: U\n          Turn 71: S\n          Turn 72: S\n          Turn 73: U\n          Turn 74: U\n          Turn 75: U\n          Turn 76: U\n          Turn 77: U\n          Turn 78: U\n          Turn 79: U\n\n        But wait: we have to go from y=3 at turn74 to y=9: that's 6 moves: 74:3->4, 75:4->5, 76:5->6, 77:6->7, 78:7->8, 79:8->9 -> yes, 6 moves. And we did 12 actions.\n\n        So we are done.\n\n        However, note that at turn75 we are at y=4 -> freeway4, and we have to check if freeway4 is dangerous at turn75? We computed that freeway4 is dangerous only at 72 and 73 -> so turn75 is safe. Similarly for others.\n\n        Therefore, we output the above sequence.\n\n        But note: the problem says \"avoid collisions with cars on freeways y=1,...,8\". And we have checked.\n\n        However, let me double-check freeway1 at turn75: if we were at freeway1 at turn75, we would be in danger, but we are at freeway4 -> so we don't care.\n\n        So the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 68: S\nTurn 69: U\nTurn 70: U\nTurn 71: S\nTurn 72: S\nTurn 73: U\nTurn 74: U\nTurn 75: U\nTurn 76: U\nTurn 77: U\nTurn 78: U\nTurn 79: U\n}\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" and so on. So we start at Turn68.\n\nHowever, the user wrote: \"current turn is \\{t_1\\}\" and in the problem t1=68.\n\nSo we output the actions for turns 68 to 79.\n\nOne more thing: the car on freeway1 has three cars. We only considered the ones that cover 0 at some turn. We did not consider the car (36,25,right,6) because it never covers 0. Similarly for the others.\n\nTherefore, the above sequence is safe.\n\nFinal answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from \\((0, 0)\\) at turn 68, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\), is 12. The sequence of actions is determined by avoiding dangerous turns on each freeway:\n\n- Freeway 1 is dangerous at turns 68, 69, 75, 76 (due to cars covering position 0).\n- Freeway 2 is dangerous at turn 70.\n- Freeways 3 to 8 are dangerous at turns 72, 73.\n\nThe strategy involves:\n- Waiting at \\(y = 0\\) for one turn (turn 68: S) to avoid being on freeway 1 at turn 69.\n- Moving up to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 70 (safe, as freeway 1 is not dangerous at turn 70) and to \\(y = 2\\) at turn 71 (safe, as freeway 2 is not dangerous at turn 71).\n- Waiting at \\(y = 2\\) for two turns (turns 71: S, 72: S) to avoid being on freeways 3-8 at turns 72 and 73.\n- Moving up consistently from turn 73 to turn 79, reaching \\(y = 9\\) at turn 80.\n\nThe sequence ensures the player is never on a freeway row at a dangerous turn:\n- Turn 68: \\(y = 0\\) (safe).\n- Turn 69: \\(y = 0\\) (safe).\n- Turn 70: \\(y = 1\\) (freeway 1 safe at turn 70).\n- Turn 71: \\(y = 2\\) (freeway 2 safe at turn 71).\n- Turn 72: \\(y = 2\\) (freeway 2 safe at turn 72).\n- Turn 73: \\(y = 2\\) (freeway 2 safe at turn 73).\n- Turn 74: \\(y = 3\\) (freeway 3 safe at turn 74).\n- Turn 75: \\(y = 4\\) (freeway 4 safe at turn 75).\n- Turn 76: \\(y = 5\\) (freeway 5 safe at turn 76).\n- Turn 77: \\(y = 6\\) (freeway 6 safe at turn 77).\n- Turn 78: \\(y = 7\\) (freeway 7 safe at turn 78).\n- Turn 79: \\(y = 8\\) (freeway 8 safe at turn 79).\n- Turn 80: \\(y = 9\\) (goal, safe).\n\nThe actions for turns 68 to 79 are:\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn } 68: \\text{ S} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 69: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 70: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 71: \\text{ S} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 72: \\text{ S} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 73: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 74: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 75: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 76: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 77: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 78: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 79: \\text{ U}\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 70, and the player is at (0,1). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns, avoiding collisions.\n\nImportant: The grid has y from 0 to 9. The freeways are from y=1 to y=8. The player starts at y=1 (which is freeway 1) and must end at y=9 (which is above freeway 8, so no car there).\n\nPlayer moves: U (up: y+1), D (down: y-1), S (stay: y same). Note that y must stay in [0,9]. We start at y=1 and want to get to y=9, so we need to go up.\n\nCollision: At turn T, if the player is at y_T (which is a freeway, i.e., between 1 and 8) and at that turn T, there is a car on that freeway such that 0 (the x-coordinate of the player) is in the span of the car at turn T.\n\nNote: When the player moves from y to y' at turn T, then at turn T the player is still on y (so we check the freeway y at turn T). Then at turn T+1, the player is on y' (so we check freeway y' at turn T+1).\n\nWe are given the state of the cars at turn t1=70.\n\nFor each freeway k (1 to 8) we have a list of cars. Each car is given by (head, tail, direction, speed). Note the representation:\n\n- For a right-moving car: the head is the larger x-coordinate? Actually, the description says:\n  - Right-moving: Span(t1) = [tau, h] meaning from tail to head, so head is the front (larger x) and tail is the rear (smaller x). Then at time T, it becomes [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n- Left-moving: [h, tau] -> becomes [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)].\n\nBut note: in the given data, all cars are right-moving? Let me check:\n\nFreeway 1: \n  (-30, -41, right, 6): This is a right-moving car. At t1=70, the span is [tail, head] = [-41, -30]? \n  But wait: the representation in the table is (head, tail, direction, speed). So for the first car on freeway1: head=-30, tail=-41, direction=right.\n\nBut for a right-moving car, we expect head > tail? Here head=-30, tail=-41 -> -30 > -41, so that's okay. The span is [tail, head] = [-41, -30]. Then at time T, the car moves right so the span becomes [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)] = [-41 + 6*(T-70), -30 + 6*(T-70)].\n\nSimilarly, the second car on freeway1: (48,37,right,6): head=48, tail=37 -> span [37,48]. Then at T: [37+6*(T-70), 48+6*(T-70)].\n\nThird car on freeway1: (12,1,right,6): head=12, tail=1 -> span [1,12]. At T: [1+6*(T-70), 12+6*(T-70)].\n\nFreeway2: (24,-11,right,36): head=24, tail=-11 -> span [-11,24]. Then at T: [-11+36*(T-70), 24+36*(T-70)].\n\nFreeways 3 to 8: each has two cars: \n  (-12,-23,right,6): head=-12, tail=-23 -> span [-23,-12]. At T: [-23+6*(T-70), -12+6*(T-70)].\n  (36,25,right,6): head=36, tail=25 -> span [25,36]. At T: [25+6*(T-70), 36+6*(T-70)].\n\nWe need to simulate the player's movement from turn 70 (current) until they reach y=9.\n\nSince we want minimal H, we should try to move up as much as possible. However, we must avoid collisions.\n\nWe start at y=1 at turn 70.\n\nAt each turn, we choose an action (U, D, S) and then update the player's y. Then we must check for the next turn which freeway we are on and whether at that turn the car spans on that freeway cover x=0.\n\nNote: At turn T, the player is at position (0, y_T). Then we check the freeway y_T (if y_T is between 1 and 8) at turn T: if any car on that freeway at turn T has a span that contains 0, then collision.\n\nImportant: When we move from y to y' at turn T, then at turn T we are still on y, so we check freeway y at turn T. Then at turn T+1, we are on y', so we check freeway y' at turn T+1.\n\nWe start at turn 70 at y=1. We are about to take an action at turn 70 (which will determine y71) and so on.\n\nWe need to find a sequence of actions that gets us to y=9 in minimal turns.\n\nLet me denote the time (in turns from t1=70) as t = 0,1,2,... meaning:\n  At step t=0: we are at turn 70, and we take action a_{70} which will lead to y_{71}.\n  We start at y_70 = 1.\n\nWe want to find H (the number of turns we take actions) such that after H actions (at turn 70+H) we have y_{70+H} = 9.\n\nSo we take actions at turns 70, 71, ..., 70+H-1, and then at turn 70+H we are at y=9.\n\nWe need to minimize H.\n\nSince we start at y=1 and need to get to y=9, the minimal number of moves without any obstacles is 8 moves (all U). But we have obstacles.\n\nWe must avoid being at a freeway (y from 1 to 8) at a turn T when there is a car on that freeway at T that covers x=0.\n\nWe can also stay or even go down to avoid a collision? But note that going down might lead to being stuck and increasing H, so we should avoid unless necessary.\n\nLet's analyze the cars on each freeway at the times we might be on them.\n\nFirst, note that the cars move continuously. We are going to compute the car spans at arbitrary turns T (T>=70).\n\nWe'll write a function to compute, for a given freeway k and turn T, whether x=0 is covered by any car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nIf it is covered, then if the player is on freeway k at turn T, they collide.\n\nWe'll compute the car positions for freeways 1 to 8.\n\nWe note that the cars on freeways 3 to 8 are identical: two cars each: \n  carA: [-23 + 6*(T-70), -12 + 6*(T-70)]\n  carB: [25 + 6*(T-70), 36 + 6*(T-70)]\n\nSimilarly, freeway1 has three cars, freeway2 has one.\n\nLet me compute for each freeway:\n\nFreeway 1 at turn T:\n  Car1: [ -41 + 6*(T-70), -30 + 6*(T-70) ]\n  Car2: [ 37 + 6*(T-70), 48 + 6*(T-70) ]\n  Car3: [ 1 + 6*(T-70), 12 + 6*(T-70) ]\n\nFreeway 2 at turn T:\n  Car1: [ -11 + 36*(T-70), 24 + 36*(T-70) ]\n\nFreeway 3 to 8 at turn T:\n  CarA: [ -23 + 6*(T-70), -12 + 6*(T-70) ]\n  CarB: [ 25 + 6*(T-70), 36 + 6*(T-70) ]\n\nWe need to check for a given T and k, if 0 is in any of the intervals for that freeway.\n\nNote: the intervals are continuous, so we can check by:\n\nFor an interval [a, b] (with a<=b), 0 is in [a,b] if a<=0<=b.\n\nNow, we are going to simulate the player's movement.\n\nWe start at turn70: y=1.\n\nWe are at freeway1 at turn70. We must check if at turn70, freeway1 has a car at x=0.\n\nCheck freeway1 at T=70:\n\n  Car1: [-41 + 0, -30+0] = [-41, -30] -> 0 not in [-41,-30]\n  Car2: [37,48] -> 0 not in [37,48]\n  Car3: [1,12] -> 0 not in [1,12]? 0 is less than 1 -> no.\n\nSo at turn70, freeway1 is safe.\n\nWe can choose an action: U, D, or S.\n\nWe want to go up, so let's try U: then at turn71, we will be at y=2.\n\nBut first, at turn70 we are at y=1, and we take action U. Then at turn71, we move to y=2.\n\nNow, we must check at turn71: \n  We were at y=1 at turn70 -> we checked and it was safe.\n  Then we move to y=2 at turn71 -> so at turn71 we are on freeway2? and we must check freeway2 at turn71.\n\nBut note: at turn70, we are on freeway1 and we moved to y=2 at turn71. Then at turn71, we are on freeway2.\n\nSo for turn71: check freeway2 at T=71.\n\nFreeway2 at T=71: \n  Car1: [ -11 + 36*(71-70), 24 + 36*(1) ] = [ -11+36, 24+36] = [25, 60] -> 0 is not in [25,60]. Safe.\n\nThen we can choose again: we are at y=2 at turn71. We can go U again to y=3 at turn72.\n\nNow at turn72, we are on freeway3 (if we moved to y=3 at turn72). So check freeway3 at T=72.\n\nFreeway3 at T=72 (which is 2 turns after 70):\n  CarA: [ -23 + 6*2, -12 + 12 ] = [-23+12, -12+12] = [-11, 0]\n  CarB: [25+12, 36+12] = [37,48]\n\nCheck CarA: [-11,0] -> 0 is included? Yes, because the interval is [a,b] inclusive? The problem doesn't specify, but typically in such problems, the span is inclusive. So 0 is in [-11,0] -> collision.\n\nTherefore, if we go U from turn70 and then U from turn71, then at turn72 we are on freeway3 and we collide.\n\nSo we cannot do two U's in a row? We must avoid freeway3 at turn72.\n\nWhat are our options?\n\nAt turn71 we are at y=2. Instead of going U, we could:\n\nOption 1: Stay (S) at turn71: then at turn71 we are at y=2 (freeway2) and we already know that at turn71, freeway2 is safe (as above). Then at turn72, we are still at y=2? Then we check freeway2 at turn72.\n\nFreeway2 at T=72: [ -11 + 36*(72-70), 24+36*2] = [-11+72, 24+72] = [61, 96] -> 0 not in. Safe.\n\nBut then we are still at y=2. We need to eventually go up.\n\nOption 2: Go down to y=1? Then at turn71 we are at y=1? But then at turn71 we are on freeway1. Check freeway1 at T=71.\n\nFreeway1 at T=71:\n  Car1: [-41+6, -30+6] = [-35,-24]\n  Car2: [37+6,48+6]=[43,54]\n  Car3: [1+6,12+6]=[7,18] -> none contains 0. Safe.\n\nBut then we are back at y=1, which is not making progress.\n\nSo we need to find a way to pass freeway3 at a safe time.\n\nLet me compute the car positions on freeway3 for a few turns:\n\nWe are at T relative to 70: let t = T-70.\n\nAt t=0: \n  CarA: [-23, -12] -> does not contain 0? because -23<=0<=-12? 0 is not <= -12 -> no.\n  CarB: [25,36] -> no.\n\nAt t=1:\n  CarA: [-23+6, -12+6] = [-17,-6] -> 0 not in [-17,-6] -> safe.\n  CarB: [31,42] -> safe.\n\nAt t=2: as above, CarA: [-11,0] -> collision if we are on freeway3 at t=2 (i.e., T=72).\n\nAt t=3:\n  CarA: [-23+18, -12+18] = [-5,6] -> 0 is in [-5,6] -> collision.\n\nAt t=4:\n  CarA: [-23+24, -12+24] = [1,12] -> 0 not in [1,12] -> safe.\n  CarB: [25+24,36+24]=[49,60] -> safe.\n\nAt t=5:\n  CarA: [-23+30, -12+30] = [7,18] -> safe.\n  CarB: [55,66] -> safe.\n\nAt t=6:\n  CarA: [13,24] -> safe.\n  CarB: [61,72] -> safe.\n\nSo freeway3 is unsafe at t=2 and t=3.\n\nWe must avoid being on freeway3 at T=72 (t=2) and T=73 (t=3).\n\nSimilarly, freeways 4 to 8 are identical to freeway3? Yes, the same car setup. So they have the same unsafe times? Actually, the problem states that each freeway has the same two cars? But note: the cars on freeway3 and freeway4 are the same? But they are independent. However, the update rule is the same, so the spans at any time T are the same for freeways 3 to 8.\n\nTherefore, for any freeway from 3 to 8, at time T (relative to 70) the cars are at:\n  CarA: [-23+6t, -12+6t]\n  CarB: [25+6t,36+6t]\n\nAnd we see that freeways 3-8 are unsafe at t=2 and t=3.\n\nNow, what about freeway1 and freeway2?\n\nFreeway1:\n\nAt time t (T-70):\n  Car1: [-41+6t, -30+6t]\n  Car2: [37+6t,48+6t]\n  Car3: [1+6t,12+6t]\n\nWe need to check when 0 is in any of these intervals.\n\nCar1: [-41+6t, -30+6t] contains 0?\n  => -41+6t <= 0 <= -30+6t\n  => 6t <= 41 and 6t>=30 -> t>=5 and t<=41/6≈6.83 -> so t=6? \n      t=5: [-41+30, -30+30] = [-11,0] -> 0 is included? yes.\n      t=6: [-41+36, -30+36] = [-5,6] -> 0 is included? yes.\n      t=7: [1,12] -> no, because 0<1.\n\nBut wait, at t=5: [-11,0] includes 0? Yes. Similarly t=6: [-5,6] includes 0.\n\nCar2: [37+6t,48+6t] -> always positive for t>=0, so never contains 0.\n\nCar3: [1+6t,12+6t] -> for t>=0, the smallest is at t=0: [1,12] -> doesn't include 0. So never.\n\nSo freeway1 is unsafe at t=5 and t=6 (i.e., T=75 and T=76).\n\nFreeway2:\n\nOnly one car: [ -11 + 36t, 24+36t ]\n\nWhen does this contain 0?\n  -11+36t <= 0 <= 24+36t\n  The right inequality is always true for t>=0 because 24+36t>=24>0.\n  The left: -11+36t<=0 -> 36t<=11 -> t<=11/36≈0.305 -> so only at t=0? \n      t=0: [-11,24] -> 0 is in [-11,24]? yes.\n      t=1: [25,60] -> no.\n      t=2: [61,96] -> no.\n\nBut wait, we were at freeway2 at turn71 (t=1) and we saw [25,60] -> safe.\n\nAt turn70 (t=0): we started at freeway1, so we didn't check freeway2 at turn70.\n\nBut if we were on freeway2 at turn70, it would be unsafe? But we weren't.\n\nSo freeway2 is unsafe only at t=0? And safe for t>=1.\n\nNow, our plan:\n\nWe start at y=1 (freeway1) at turn70 (t=0). We are safe (as computed).\n\nWe want to get to y=9. We must pass through freeways 1 to 8? Actually, we start at freeway1 (y=1) and then we go to freeway2 (y=2), then freeway3 (y=3), etc.\n\nBut we must avoid being on freeway3 at t=2 and t=3 (i.e., turn72 and turn73) and also avoid freeway1 at t=5 and t=6 (turn75 and turn76). Also, note that freeways 4 to 8 are the same as freeway3: unsafe at t=2 and t=3.\n\nBut wait: if we are on freeway4 at t=2, that would be unsafe? Yes. Similarly for freeway5, etc.\n\nBut note: we don't have to be on each freeway at the same relative time. We can be on freeway3 at a different time.\n\nOur goal: we must traverse from y=1 to y=9. The minimal time is 8 moves (each U). That would be:\n\nTurn70: U -> y=2 at turn71\nTurn71: U -> y=3 at turn72 -> but freeway3 at turn72 (t=2) is unsafe.\n\nSo we need to delay.\n\nHow about we wait at y=2 for two turns? Then:\n\nTurn70: U -> y=2 at turn71 (t=1) [freeway2 at turn71: safe]\nTurn71: S -> y=2 at turn72 (t=2) [freeway2 at turn72: safe? at t=2: freeway2 car: [-11+36*2,24+72]=[61,96] -> safe]\nTurn72: U -> y=3 at turn73 (t=3) [freeway3 at turn73: t=3 -> unsafe (CarA: [-5,6] includes 0). So collision at turn73.\n\nNot good.\n\nWait at y=2 for one turn and then go to y=3 at turn72? Then at turn72 we are on freeway3 at t=2 -> unsafe.\n\nSo we must avoid being on freeway3 at t=2 and t=3. Therefore, we must be on freeway3 at t<2 or t>=4.\n\nBut we start at t=0 at y=1. If we go up without waiting, we get to y=3 at t=2 -> unsafe.\n\nIf we wait at y=1 for one turn:\n\nTurn70: S -> y=1 at turn71 (t=1) [freeway1 at t=1: safe? \n  t=1: freeway1: \n    Car1: [-35,-24] -> safe\n    Car2: [43,54] -> safe\n    Car3: [7,18] -> safe.\n  Then turn71: U -> y=2 at turn72 (t=2) [freeway2 at t=2: safe? [61,96] -> safe]\n  Then turn72: U -> y=3 at turn73 (t=3) [freeway3 at t=3: unsafe] -> collision.\n\nWait at y=1 for two turns:\n\nTurn70: S -> y=1 at turn71 (t=1: safe)\nTurn71: S -> y=1 at turn72 (t=2) [freeway1 at t=2: \n    Car1: [-41+12, -30+12] = [-29,-18] -> safe\n    Car2: [49,60] -> safe\n    Car3: [13,24] -> safe]\nTurn72: U -> y=2 at turn73 (t=3) [freeway2 at t=3: \n    car: [-11+36*3, 24+36*3] = [-11+108, 24+108] = [97,132] -> safe]\nTurn73: U -> y=3 at turn74 (t=4) [freeway3 at t=4: safe (as above: t=4: CarA: [1,12] -> 0 not in; CarB: [49,60]) -> safe]\n\nThen we can continue up.\n\nBut we are at y=3 at turn74 (t=4). Then:\n\nTurn73: U -> y=4 at turn74? Actually, at turn73 we are at y=3 (after moving from y=2 at turn73 to y=3 at turn74? Let me clarify:\n\nAt turn72: we are at y=2 (after S at turn71 and then U at turn72: so at turn72 we were at y=2 and we took U -> then at turn73 we are at y=3? \nBut note: the movement: at turn72 (action U) -> y_{73} = y_{72} + 1 = 2+1=3.\n\nThen at turn73, we are at y=3 -> so we check freeway3 at turn73? But wait, we just computed that at turn73 (t=3) freeway3 is unsafe.\n\nBut in the above, we moved to y=3 at turn73? Then we are on freeway3 at turn73 (t=3) -> unsafe.\n\nMistake in the timeline:\n\nWe must be careful: the turn when we are at a freeway is the turn at which we check.\n\nLet me write the timeline:\n\nTurn70: start at y=1 (freeway1). Action S -> so at turn71, we are still at y=1? \n  Actually: \n    At turn70: we take action S -> so y_{71} = y_{70} + 0 = 1.\n    Then at turn71, we are at y=1.\n\nThen turn71: action S -> y_{72}=1.\n\nThen turn72: action U -> then y_{73} = 1 + 1 = 2? \n  But we want to go to y=3? \n\nI think I messed up.\n\nLet me define:\n\nAt the beginning of turn t, the player is at y_t. Then we choose action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nAt turn70: y70=1. We take action a70: \n  if S: then y71=1.\n  if U: then y71=2.\n  if D: then y71=0? but we are at y=1, D would go to 0.\n\nNow, when we are at a turn T, we check the freeway y_T at time T.\n\nSo:\n\nAt turn70: we are at y70=1 -> check freeway1 at T=70: safe.\n\nThen we take an action at turn70, which leads to y71.\n\nAt turn71: we are at y71 -> check freeway y71 at T=71.\n\nSo in the waiting plan:\n\nPlan: wait at y=1 for two turns.\n\nTurn70: action S -> y71=1.\n  Then at turn71: we are at y71=1 -> check freeway1 at T=71: safe (as above).\n\nTurn71: action S -> y72=1.\n  Then at turn72: we are at y72=1 -> check freeway1 at T=72: \n      Car1: [-29,-18] -> safe\n      Car2: [49,60] -> safe\n      Car3: [13,24] -> safe.\n\nTurn72: action U -> then y73 = 1+1 = 2.\n  Then at turn73: we are at y73=2 -> check freeway2 at T=73 (t=3): \n        [ -11+36*(73-70)= -11+36*3 = -11+108=97, 24+108=132] -> safe.\n\nTurn73: action U -> then y74 = 2+1=3.\n  Then at turn74: we are at y74=3 -> check freeway3 at T=74 (t=4): \n        CarA: [-23+6*4, -12+24] = [-23+24, -12+24] = [1,12] -> safe (0 not in)\n        CarB: [25+24,36+24]=[49,60] -> safe.\n\nThen we can continue:\n\nTurn74: U -> y75=4 -> at turn75: check freeway4 at T=75 (t=5): \n        CarA: [-23+30, -12+30]=[7,18] -> safe\n        CarB: [55,66] -> safe.\n\nTurn75: U -> y76=5 -> at turn76: freeway5 at T=76 (t=6): \n        CarA: [13,24] -> safe\n        CarB: [61,72] -> safe.\n\nTurn76: U -> y77=6 -> at turn77: freeway6 at T=77 (t=7): \n        CarA: [-23+42, -12+42]=[19,30] -> safe\n        CarB: [25+42,36+42]=[67,78] -> safe.\n\nTurn77: U -> y78=7 -> at turn78: freeway7 at T=78 (t=8): \n        CarA: [-23+48, -12+48]=[25,36] -> safe\n        CarB: [25+48,36+48]=[73,84] -> safe.\n\nTurn78: U -> y79=8 -> at turn79: freeway8 at T=79 (t=9): \n        CarA: [-23+54, -12+54]=[31,42] -> safe\n        CarB: [25+54,36+54]=[79,90] -> safe.\n\nTurn79: U -> y80=9 -> at turn80: we are at y=9 -> goal (no freeway at y=9, so no check).\n\nSo we reach at turn80, which is 10 moves? We started at turn70 and we took 10 actions: from turn70 to turn79 (10 actions) and then at turn80 we are at y=9.\n\nH = number of actions = 10.\n\nBut we started at turn70 and we took actions at turns 70,71,...,79 -> 10 actions, then at turn80 we are at y=9.\n\nBut can we do better?\n\nNote: we avoided freeway3 at t=2 and t=3 by waiting two turns at y=1. Then we went up without stopping.\n\nBut we also have to worry about freeway1 at t=5 and t=6 (T=75 and T=76). In our path, we left freeway1 at turn73 (when we moved to y=2) and then we never went back. So we are not on freeway1 at T=75 or T=76.\n\nBut what if we try to go faster?\n\nWe must avoid freeway3 at t=2 and t=3. We were at y=1 at t=0,1,2. Then we moved to y=2 at t=3? Actually in the above we moved to y=2 at turn73 (which is t=3) and then to y=3 at turn74 (t=4). \n\nIs there a way to be on freeway3 at t>=4 without waiting so long?\n\nWe started at t=0 at y=1. If we don't wait, we get to y=3 at t=2 -> unsafe.\n\nIf we wait only one turn at y=1:\n\nTurn70: S -> y71=1 (t=1: safe at freeway1)\nTurn71: U -> y72=2 (t=2: at turn72 we are at y=2 -> freeway2 at T=72: safe? [61,96] -> safe)\nThen at turn72: we are at y=2. Now we want to go to y=3 at turn73? \n  Then at turn73 we are at y=3 (t=3) -> unsafe.\n\nBut what if we don't go to y=3 at turn72? We could wait at y=2 for one turn?\n\nTurn72: S -> y73=2 (t=3: freeway2 at T=73: [97,132] -> safe)\nTurn73: U -> y74=3 (t=4: freeway3 at T=74: safe as above)\n\nThen we can continue:\n\nTurn74: U -> y75=4 (t=5: freeway4 at T=75: safe? [7,18] -> safe)\nTurn75: U -> y76=5 (t=6: freeway5 at T=76: [13,24] -> safe)\nTurn76: U -> y77=6 (t=7: freeway6: [19,30] -> safe)\nTurn77: U -> y78=7 (t=8: freeway7: [25,36] -> safe)\nTurn78: U -> y79=8 (t=9: freeway8: [31,42] -> safe)\nTurn79: U -> y80=9 -> goal.\n\nSo again 10 moves? Same as before.\n\nBut note: we took one wait at y=1 and one wait at y=2. Total moves: 10.\n\nBut we can try to minimize the waiting.\n\nWhat if we go up to y=2 quickly and then wait at y=2 for two turns? Then we avoid freeway3 at t=2 and t=3 by being at y=2 until t>=4.\n\nPlan:\n\nTurn70: U -> y71=2 (t=1: freeway2 at T=71: [25,60] -> safe? Actually at T=71: \n        freeway2: [-11+36*1,24+36]=[25,60] -> safe)\nTurn71: S -> y72=2 (t=2: freeway2 at T=72: [61,96] -> safe)\nTurn72: S -> y73=2 (t=3: freeway2 at T=73: [97,132] -> safe)\nTurn73: U -> y74=3 (t=4: freeway3 safe)\nThen same as above: \nTurn74: U -> y75=4\nTurn75: U -> y76=5\nTurn76: U -> y77=6\nTurn77: U -> y78=7\nTurn78: U -> y79=8\nTurn79: U -> y80=9\n\nThat's 10 moves again.\n\nBut we started by moving up at turn70, then waited two turns at y=2.\n\nTotal moves: 10.\n\nCan we do it in 9 moves?\n\nWe need to get from y=1 to y=9 in 8 moves? But we have to avoid the unsafe times.\n\nThe unsafe freeways:\n\nfreeway3-8: unsafe at t=2,3.\n\nfreeway1: unsafe at t=5,6.\n\nWe start at t=0 at y=1.\n\nWe must be at y=9 at some turn. The minimal number of moves is 8, meaning we would be at:\n\nturn70: y=1 -> t=0\nturn71: y=2 -> t=1\nturn72: y=3 -> t=2 -> unsafe (freeway3 at t=2)\nturn73: y=4 -> t=3 -> unsafe (freeway4 at t=3)\nturn74: y=5 -> t=4 -> safe (freeway5: t=4: safe? freeway5 same as freeway3: t=4 safe)\nturn75: y=6 -> t=5 -> safe (freeway6: t=5: safe? [7,18] -> safe)\nturn76: y=7 -> t=6 -> safe (freeway7: t=6: [13,24] -> safe)\nturn77: y=8 -> t=7 -> safe (freeway8: t=7: [19,30] -> safe)\nturn78: y=9 -> goal.\n\nBut we crash at turn72 and turn73.\n\nSo we must avoid being on freeway3 at t=2 and freeway4 at t=3? \n\nBut note: at turn72 we are on freeway3 (y=3) at t=2 -> unsafe.\nAt turn73 we are on freeway4 (y=4) at t=3 -> unsafe.\n\nSo we must avoid both.\n\nWe might try to wait at some point.\n\nWhat if we wait at y=2 for one turn? Then:\n\nturn70: U -> y71=2 (t=1: safe at freeway2)\nturn71: S -> y72=2 (t=2: safe at freeway2)\nturn72: U -> y73=3 (t=3: freeway3 at t=3 -> unsafe)\n\nSo we crash at turn73.\n\nWait at y=2 for two turns? Then:\n\nturn70: U -> y71=2 (t=1: safe)\nturn71: S -> y72=2 (t=2: safe)\nturn72: S -> y73=2 (t=3: safe at freeway2)\nturn73: U -> y74=3 (t=4: safe at freeway3)\nturn74: U -> y75=4 (t=5: freeway4 at t=5: safe? [7,18] -> safe)\nturn75: U -> y76=5 (t=6: freeway5: [13,24] -> safe)\nturn76: U -> y77=6 (t=7: freeway6: [19,30] -> safe)\nturn77: U -> y78=7 (t=8: freeway7: [25,36] -> safe)\nturn78: U -> y79=8 (t=9: freeway8: [31,42] -> safe)\nturn79: U -> y80=9 -> goal.\n\nStill 10 moves.\n\nBut we started at y=1 and we did one U and then two S, then U all the way: total moves 10.\n\nTo save a move, we need to avoid one wait.\n\nWhat if we go down? But going down would make us go back and then we have to come up again, which would take more moves.\n\nAnother idea: can we be on freeway1 at a time that is not unsafe? We are at freeway1 at t=0 (safe) and then we left. But what if we leave freeway1 later and then get stuck because of the unsafe times at freeway1 at t=5,6?\n\nBut in our current path we avoid freeway1 after t=0 or t=1 or t=2.\n\nBut note: we are going up, so we don't go back to freeway1.\n\nNow, what about freeway2? It's safe for t>=1.\n\nBut we must go through freeway3 to 8, which are unsafe at t=2,3.\n\nThe problem is that we have to traverse 8 freeways (from y=1 to y=8) and then to y=9. The minimal time is 8 moves, but we have to avoid two specific times (t=2 and t=3) for the freeways from 3 to 8.\n\nIf we start at t=0 at y=1, then at t=1 we are at y=2, at t=2 we would be at y=3 -> unsafe. So we must be at a freeway that is not 3 to 8 at t=2 and t=3? But the only other freeways are 1 and 2.\n\nSo we can be at freeway1 or freeway2 at t=2 and t=3.\n\nBut we cannot be at freeway1 at t=5 and t=6? But we don't have to be there.\n\nSo we can plan to be at freeway2 at t=2 and t=3, then at t=4 we go to freeway3, then freeway4 at t=5, etc.\n\nBut then we are at:\n\nt=0: y=1\nt=1: y=2\nt=2: y=2 (we stay at turn71 and turn72? \nt=3: y=2\nt=4: y=3\nt=5: y=4\nt=6: y=5\nt=7: y=6\nt=8: y=7\nt=9: y=8\nt=10: y=9\n\nBut that would take 10 moves: actions at turn70 to turn79 (10 actions) to reach y=9 at turn80.\n\nSame as before.\n\nBut note: we can try to go faster after t=4.\n\nThe moves:\n\nturn70: U -> y71=2 (t=1)\nturn71: S -> y72=2 (t=2)\nturn72: S -> y73=2 (t=3)\nturn73: U -> y74=3 (t=4)\nturn74: U -> y75=4 (t=5)\nturn75: U -> y76=5 (t=6)\nturn76: U -> y77=6 (t=7)\nturn77: U -> y78=7 (t=8)\nturn78: U -> y79=8 (t=9)\nturn79: U -> y80=9\n\n10 moves.\n\nBut is there a way to do it in 9 moves?\n\nWe need to be at y=9 at turn79. That means we take 9 actions: from turn70 to turn78, and at turn79 we are at y=9.\n\nThe sequence of y positions:\n\ny70=1\ny71: after a70\n...\ny79: after a78\n\nWe want y79=9.\n\nThe net movement: we need to go from 1 to 9, which is +8. Each U is +1, D is -1, S is 0. So the number of U moves must be 8 more than the number of D moves. Let U_count - D_count = 8.\n\nTotal moves: 9.\n\nSo U_count + D_count + S_count = 9\nU_count - D_count = 8\n\nAdding: 2*U_count + S_count = 17 -> U_count = (17 - S_count)/2.\n\nSo S_count must be odd? and U_count must be at least 8.\n\nPossible: \n  If S_count=1, then U_count=(17-1)/2=8, then D_count=0.\n  If S_count=3, then U_count=(17-3)/2=7 -> but then U_count - D_count = 7 - D_count =8 -> D_count=-1? impossible.\n  So only possibility: S_count=1, U_count=8, D_count=0.\n\nSo we must have 8 U and 1 S in 9 moves.\n\nNow, the y positions:\n\ny70=1\ny71: 1 or 2? \n...\ny79=9\n\nWe have 8 U and 1 S, so the y will increase by 8 in total.\n\nThe positions:\n\nAt turn70: y=1\nAfter 9 moves, we have done 8 U and 1 S: so we end at 1+8=9.\n\nNow, we must assign the S to one of the turns.\n\nWe must avoid collisions.\n\nThe times: turn70: t=0\n         turn71: t=1\n         ...\n         turn78: t=8\n         turn79: we are at y=9, so no check.\n\nWe are on a freeway at turns 70 to 78 if y_t is between 1 and 8.\n\nWe must avoid:\n\n- On freeway1 at t=5 or 6 (T=75 or 76)\n- On freeway2: only unsafe at t=0, but we are not on freeway2 at t=0 (we start at freeway1 at t=0). And freeway2 is safe for t>=1.\n- On freeways 3-8 at t=2 or 3 (T=72,73)\n\nWe are at:\n\nt=0: y70=1 (freeway1) -> safe (as we know)\nt=1: y71: either 1 (if we did S at turn70) or 2 (if we did U at turn70)\n\nWe have to have one S and eight U's.\n\nLet me try to put the S at different positions.\n\nOption A: S at turn70.\n\nThen:\nturn70: S -> y71=1\nthen we must do U at every other turn to get 8 U's.\n\nThen:\nturn71: U -> y72=2\nturn72: U -> y73=3 -> at turn73: t=3, freeway3 -> unsafe (t=3) -> crash.\n\nOption B: S at turn71.\n\nThen:\nturn70: U -> y71=2 (t=1: freeway2 safe)\nturn71: S -> y72=2 (t=2: freeway2 safe)\nturn72: U -> y73=3 (t=3: freeway3 unsafe) -> crash.\n\nOption C: S at turn72.\n\nThen:\nturn70: U -> y71=2 (t=1: safe)\nturn71: U -> y72=3 (t=2: freeway3 unsafe) -> already crash at turn72.\n\nOption D: S at turn73.\n\nThen:\nturn70: U -> y71=2 (t=1: safe)\nturn71: U -> y72=3 (t=2: unsafe) -> crash.\n\nOption E: S at turn74.\n\nThen:\nturn70: U -> y71=2 (t=1: safe)\nturn71: U -> y72=3 (t=2: unsafe) -> crash.\n\nSimilarly, if we put the S later, we crash at turn72.\n\nWhat if we put the S at turn75 or later?\n\nBut then we are forced to do U at turn70,71,72,73,74: then we would be:\n\ny70=1\ny71=2 (after U70)\ny72=3 (after U71) -> unsafe at turn72 (t=2)\ncrash.\n\nSo we always crash at turn72 if we do two U's in the beginning.\n\nTherefore, it's impossible to do in 9 moves.\n\nSo minimal H is 10.\n\nNow, we have two plans that take 10 moves.\n\nPlan 1: wait two turns at y=1 then go up.\n\nPlan 2: go to y=2 at turn70, then wait two turns at y=2, then go up.\n\nBut note: in the first plan (wait two at y=1), we were at freeway1 at t=0,1,2. And freeway1 is safe at t=0,1,2 (only unsafe at t=5,6).\n\nIn the second plan, we are at freeway2 at t=1,2,3, which is safe.\n\nBoth are valid.\n\nBut we must output one.\n\nWe can choose either.\n\nLet me write the first plan:\n\nActions:\n\nTurn70: S\nTurn71: S\nTurn72: U\nTurn73: U\nTurn74: U\nTurn75: U\nTurn76: U\nTurn77: U\nTurn78: U\nTurn79: U\n\nBut we start at y70=1.\n\nAfter Turn70 (S): y71=1\nAfter Turn71 (S): y72=1\nAfter Turn72 (U): y73=2\nAfter Turn73 (U): y74=3\nAfter Turn74 (U): y75=4\nAfter Turn75 (U): y76=5\nAfter Turn76 (U): y77=6\nAfter Turn77 (U): y78=7\nAfter Turn78 (U): y79=8\nAfter Turn79 (U): y80=9\n\nSo we reach at turn80.\n\nBut the problem: the answer format should list the actions for turn70 to turn70+H-1. H=10, so turns 70 to 79.\n\nWe need to check if we avoid collisions at every turn.\n\nWe check:\n\nTurn70: y70=1 -> freeway1 at T=70: safe (as before)\nTurn71: y71=1 -> freeway1 at T=71: safe\nTurn72: y72=1 -> freeway1 at T=72: safe (t=2: [-29,-18], [49,60], [13,24] -> no 0)\nTurn73: y73=2 -> freeway2 at T=73: [97,132] -> safe\nTurn74: y74=3 -> freeway3 at T=74: [1,12] and [49,60] -> no 0 -> safe\nTurn75: y75=4 -> freeway4 at T=75: [7,18] and [55,66] -> safe\nTurn76: y76=5 -> freeway5 at T=76: [13,24] and [61,72] -> safe\nTurn77: y77=6 -> freeway6 at T=77: [19,30] and [67,78] -> safe\nTurn78: y78=7 -> freeway7 at T=78: [25,36] and [73,84] -> safe\nTurn79: y79=8 -> freeway8 at T=79: [31,42] and [79,90] -> safe\n\nAll safe.\n\nNow, the second plan:\n\nTurn70: U -> y71=2\nTurn71: S -> y72=2\nTurn72: S -> y73=2\nTurn73: U -> y74=3\nTurn74: U -> y75=4\nTurn75: U -> y76=5\nTurn76: U -> y77=6\nTurn77: U -> y78=7\nTurn78: U -> y79=8\nTurn79: U -> y80=9\n\nCheck collisions:\n\nTurn70: y70=1 -> freeway1 at T=70: safe\nTurn71: y71=2 -> freeway2 at T=71: [25,60] -> safe\nTurn72: y72=2 -> freeway2 at T=72: [61,96] -> safe\nTurn73: y73=2 -> freeway2 at T=73: [97,132] -> safe\nTurn74: y74=3 -> freeway3 at T=74: [1,12] and [49,60] -> safe\nTurn75: y75=4 -> freeway4 at T=75: [7,18] and [55,66] -> safe\nTurn76: y76=5 -> freeway5 at T=76: [13,24] and [61,72] -> safe\nTurn77: y77=6 -> freeway6 at T=77: [19,30] and [67,78] -> safe\nTurn78: y78=7 -> freeway7 at T=78: [25,36] and [73,84] -> safe\nTurn79: y79=8 -> freeway8 at T=79: [31,42] and [79,90] -> safe\n\nAlso safe.\n\nBoth take 10 moves.\n\nWe can choose either. I'll choose the first one.\n\nBut note: in the first plan we are at freeway1 for three turns (t0, t1, t2) and then we move. In the second plan, we leave freeway1 immediately and wait at freeway2.\n\nBut both are minimal.\n\nI think we can output the first plan.\n\nBut the problem: we start at (0,1) and we are at y=1 for three turns? Then we go up. It's acceptable.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nTurn70: S\nTurn71: S\nTurn72: U\nTurn73: U\nTurn74: U\nTurn75: U\nTurn76: U\nTurn77: U\nTurn78: U\nTurn79: U\n\nBut wait, we have 10 actions: turns 70 to 79.\n\nWe end at y80=9.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and H is the minimal number of turns.\n\nSo H=10.\n\nNow, write the answer.\n\nBut note: the current turn is t1=70, and we are about to take the first action at turn70.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 70: S\nTurn 71: S\nTurn 72: U\nTurn 73: U\nTurn 74: U\nTurn 75: U\nTurn 76: U\nTurn 77: U\nTurn 78: U\nTurn 79: U\n\nBut we are at y=1 for the first three states? Then we go up.\n\nBut in the sequence above, after two S we do U at turn72, which moves us to y=2 at turn73? \n\nLet me verify the positions:\n\nAt turn70: we start at (0,1). We take action S: so at turn71, we are at (0,1).\nAt turn71: action S: at turn72, we are at (0,1).\nAt turn72: action U: at turn73, we are at (0,2).\nAt turn73: action U: at turn74, we are at (0,3).\n...\nAt turn79: action U: at turn80, we are at (0,9).\n\nYes.\n\nBut in the answer, we list the actions for the current turn and the next 9.\n\nSo the answer:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 70: S\nTurn 71: S\nTurn 72: U\nTurn 73: U\nTurn 74: U\nTurn 75: U\nTurn 76: U\nTurn 77: U\nTurn 78: U\nTurn 79: U\n}\n\nBut wait, we have 10 actions? From turn70 to turn79, that's 10 turns.\n\nBut the problem: we are at turn70 and we take actions until we reach at turn80? But the last action is at turn79, and then at turn80 we are at y=9.\n\nSo H=10.\n\nWe can also try to see if we can do it in 10 moves with a different sequence, but we already saw that 9 is impossible.\n\nAnother idea: what if we go down to y=0? But that might take extra moves.\n\nFor example, if we go down at some point, then we have to come back up, which would take at least two extra moves (down and then up) so total at least 10 moves? But we already have a 10 move solution.\n\nSo we'll go with the above.\n\nBut note: in the first two turns we are at y=1, which is freeway1, and we checked that it is safe at t=0,1,2.\n\nBut what about the car on freeway1 at t=0,1,2? We have:\n\nAt t=0: safe.\nAt t=1: safe.\nAt t=2: safe.\n\nBut we must also check that we are not colliding at the moment we are at that freeway.\n\nSo we are safe.\n\nTherefore, the answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 1)\\) at turn 70 is 10. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by waiting at \\(y = 1\\) for two turns to avoid unsafe times on higher freeways, then moving up continuously.\n\n- **Collision Avoidance**:\n  - Freeways 3 to 8 are unsafe at turns 72 and 73 (relative times \\(t = 2\\) and \\(t = 3\\)) due to cars covering \\(x = 0\\).\n  - Freeway 1 is unsafe at turns 75 and 76 (relative times \\(t = 5\\) and \\(t = 6\\)), but the sequence avoids being on freeway 1 at these times.\n  - Freeway 2 is safe for all turns after 70.\n  - By staying at \\(y = 1\\) for turns 70, 71, and 72, the player avoids freeways 3-8 during unsafe turns 72 and 73. The subsequent upward moves traverse freeways 3-8 at safe times (turns 74 to 79).\n\n**Action Sequence**:\n- Turn 70: Stay (S) to remain at \\(y = 1\\) (safe, as no car covers \\(x = 0\\) at turn 70).\n- Turn 71: Stay (S) to remain at \\(y = 1\\) (safe at turn 71).\n- Turn 72: Move up (U) to \\(y = 2\\) at turn 73 (safe at turn 73, freeway 2 car span [97, 132] does not cover 0).\n- Turn 73: Move up (U) to \\(y = 3\\) at turn 74 (safe at turn 74, freeway 3 car spans [1, 12] and [49, 60] do not cover 0).\n- Turn 74: Move up (U) to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 75 (safe at turn 75, freeway 4 car spans [7, 18] and [55, 66] do not cover 0).\n- Turn 75: Move up (U) to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 76 (safe at turn 76, freeway 5 car spans [13, 24] and [61, 72] do not cover 0).\n- Turn 76: Move up (U) to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 77 (safe at turn 77, freeway 6 car spans [19, 30] and [67, 78] do not cover 0).\n- Turn 77: Move up (U) to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 78 (safe at turn 78, freeway 7 car spans [25, 36] and [73, 84] do not cover 0).\n- Turn 78: Move up (U) to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 79 (safe at turn 79, freeway 8 car spans [31, 42] and [79, 90] do not cover 0).\n- Turn 79: Move up (U) to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 80 (goal reached, no freeway at \\(y = 9\\)).\n\nThis sequence ensures the player reaches \\((0, 9)\\) in 10 turns (actions from turn 70 to turn 79) without collisions.\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn } 70: \\text{S} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 71: \\text{S} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 72: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 73: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 74: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 75: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 76: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 77: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 78: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 79: \\text{U}\n}",

The actions change the y-coordinate as per the rules.\n\nImportant note: The grid has y from 0 to 9. The freeways (with cars) are from y=1 to y=8. The player starts at y=0 and must end at y=9. We must avoid collisions: at turn T, if the player is at y_T (which is between 1 and 8) then we check the cars on that freeway (row) at that exact turn T. The collision occurs if the player's x-coordinate (which is always 0) falls within the span of any car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nCar update: \n  - For a car at freeway k (which is fixed), its position at turn T (relative to turn t1=95) is determined by:\n    Let delta_t = T - 95.\n    For a left-moving car: the span becomes [h - s*delta_t, tau - s*delta_t] (note: the head is initially at h, and it moves left so it decreases)\n    But wait: the problem says:\n      Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, tau] -> Span(T) = [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\n      However, note that the example cars are all right-moving? Actually, the table shows direction as \"right\" for all.\n\n    For right-moving: \n      Span(t1) = [tau, h] -> becomes [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut note: the table representation for right-moving: at t1, the car is from tau to h (with tau <= h) and then it moves right so both endpoints increase.\n\nHowever, looking at the data:\n\nFreeway 1: \n  (48,37,right,6) -> this doesn't make sense because 48>37? So if it's right-moving, then the head should be the larger one? But the representation says (head, tail, direction, speed). \n\nBut the problem states for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [tau, h]\" meaning that the tail is at tau and head at h, with tau <= h? But in the data, we have (48,37,right,6): here head=48, tail=37? Then the span at t1 is [37,48]? Then at time T, the span becomes [37 + s*(T-t1), 48 + s*(T-t1)].\n\nSimilarly, the other cars.\n\nAlso note: collision occurs only when the player is at a freeway (y from 1 to 8) and at the same time the car's span at that turn T contains 0.\n\nImportant: when the player moves from y to y' at turn T, at turn T the player is still at y (not y'). So when we are at turn T, we are at y_T and we check the freeway y_T. Then after the action, we move to y_{T+1} and then at turn T+1 we check freeway y_{T+1}.\n\nWe start at turn 95 at y=0. We are not on a freeway at turn 95 (since freeways are 1..8). So we don't check any car at turn 95.\n\nWe must plan a sequence of actions that takes us from y0=0 to y=9 without ever being on a freeway row (1..8) at a turn T when a car on that row has a span that includes 0.\n\nWe want the minimal number of turns.\n\nSince we can only change y by at most 1 per turn, we need at least 9 moves to go from 0 to 9 (if we always go up). But we might have to wait (stay) sometimes to avoid cars.\n\nSo the minimal H without any obstacles would be 9. But we have to check if we can go up every turn without colliding.\n\nWe'll simulate the path from turn 95 onward. We are at turn 95: y=0.\n\nAt each turn T (starting at 95), we choose an action (U, D, S) that leads to the next y.\n\nWe need to check at every turn T (for T>=95) until we reach y=9, that if y_T (the position at the beginning of turn T) is between 1 and 8, then we must avoid the cars on that freeway at turn T.\n\nNote: at the turn when we arrive at 9, we don't check because 9 is not a freeway? The freeways are y=1 to 8. So when we are at y=9, we are safe.\n\nSo our goal is to get to y=9 as quickly as possible without being hit on rows 1-8.\n\nWe'll try to go up as much as possible, but we have to check the car positions at the time we are on each row.\n\nLet's denote:\n  T: the turn (starting at 95)\n\nWe need to compute for each freeway k (1 to 8) and for each car on that freeway, the span at turn T (relative to t1=95) as:\n  delta_t = T - 95\n  For a right-moving car (with initial head h, tail tau, speed s): \n      the span at T is [tau + s*delta_t, h + s*delta_t]\n\nWe are only concerned when the player is on row k at turn T, and then we check if 0 is in the span of any car on row k at that turn.\n\nNow, let's list the cars for each freeway:\n\nFreeway 1:\n  Car1: (h=48, tau=37, d=right, s=6) -> span at T: [37 + 6*(T-95), 48 + 6*(T-95)]\n  Car2: (12,1,right,6) -> [1+6*(T-95), 12+6*(T-95)]\n  Car3: (-24,-35,right,6) -> [-35+6*(T-95), -24+6*(T-95)]\n\nFreeway 2:\n  Car: (-48,-83,right,36) -> [-83+36*(T-95), -48+36*(T-95)]\n\nFreeway 3 to 8: \n  Each has two cars:\n      Car1: (-48,-59,right,6) -> [-59+6*(T-95), -48+6*(T-95)]\n      Car2: (0,-11,right,6) -> [-11+6*(T-95), 0+6*(T-95)]\n\nNote: For freeway 3 to 8, the second car at turn T: \n  [-11 + 6*(T-95), 0 + 6*(T-95)] = [6*(T-95)-11, 6*(T-95)]\n\nWe must avoid being at freeway k at turn T if 0 is in any of the car spans on that freeway.\n\nLet's analyze the critical times for each freeway:\n\nWe are going to simulate the journey. We start at y=0 at turn 95.\n\nWe need to get to y=9. The minimal time is 9 turns (if we go up 9 times). But we have to check each freeway we step on.\n\nWe will step on:\n  turn 95: y=0 (safe, not on freeway)\n  turn 96: if we go up, then we are at y=1 -> then we check freeway 1 at turn 96.\n  turn 97: y=2 -> check freeway 2 at turn 97.\n  turn 98: y=3 -> freeway 3 at turn 98.\n  ... until turn 104: we are at y=8 (freeway 8) at turn 104, and then at turn 105 we go to y=9 (and we are done at turn 105).\n\nBut we have to check each of these turns (96 to 104) for collisions.\n\nLet's compute the car spans for the required turns.\n\nFirst, for freeway 1 at turn 96 (delta_t=1):\n  Car1: [37+6*1, 48+6*1] = [43,54] -> 0 not in [43,54]\n  Car2: [1+6, 12+6] = [7,18] -> 0 not in [7,18]\n  Car3: [-35+6, -24+6] = [-29,-18] -> 0 not in [-29,-18]\n  So freeway 1 at turn 96 is safe.\n\nFreeway 2 at turn 97 (delta_t=2):\n  Only car: [-83+36*2, -48+36*2] = [-83+72, -48+72] = [-11,24] -> 0 is in [-11,24]? Yes, because -11<=0<=24.\n\nSo if we are on freeway 2 at turn 97, we would collide.\n\nTherefore, we cannot be on freeway 2 at turn 97.\n\nSo the naive plan (always going up) fails at turn 97.\n\nWe must adjust. We can either:\n  - Delay arriving at freeway 2 so that we are not there at turn 97, or\n  - Arrive earlier? But we start at turn 95 at y=0. We can't be at freeway 2 earlier than turn 97 (if we go up two steps: turn 96: y=1, turn97: y=2).\n\nSo we must avoid being at freeway 2 at turn 97.\n\nHow? We can wait at some row for one turn so that we skip that dangerous turn.\n\nFor example:\n  We could go up to y=1 at turn96 (safe), then at turn97 instead of going up to y=2 (which would put us on freeway2 at turn97 and cause collision), we can stay at y=1 (so at turn97 we are still on freeway1) or go down to y=0? But going down to y=0 at turn97 would avoid freeway2, but then we have to come back.\n\nBut note: we are at freeway1 at turn97? Then we must check freeway1 at turn97.\n\nCheck freeway1 at turn97 (delta_t=2):\n  Car1: [37+12, 48+12] = [49,60] -> safe\n  Car2: [1+12,12+12]=[13,24] -> safe\n  Car3: [-35+12, -24+12]=[-23,-12] -> safe\nSo freeway1 at turn97 is safe.\n\nSo plan:\n  turn95: U -> y=1 at turn96? Actually, at the end of turn95 we move to y=1? \n  But note: the update: at turn t, we choose a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t.\n\n  So at turn95 (current turn): we choose an action. Then at the next state (turn96) we are at y1 = y95 + Delta.\n\n  Therefore:\n    Turn95: we start at y=0. We choose an action. If we choose U, then at turn96 we are at y=1.\n\n  Now, at turn96: we are at y=1 (freeway1) and we must check freeway1 at turn96 -> we did: safe.\n\n  Then at turn96: we choose an action. If we choose S (stay), then at turn97 we remain at y=1.\n\n  Then at turn97: we are at y=1 (freeway1) and we check freeway1 at turn97 -> safe.\n\n  Then at turn97: we can choose U to go to y=2 at turn98.\n\nBut now we are at freeway2 at turn98? Then we check freeway2 at turn98 (delta_t=3):\n  Car on freeway2: [-83+36*3, -48+36*3] = [-83+108, -48+108] = [25,60] -> 0 not in [25,60] -> safe.\n\nSo then we can continue.\n\nBut we lost one turn: we stayed at y=1 for one extra turn.\n\nSo the sequence so far:\n  Turn95: U -> to y=1 at turn96\n  Turn96: S -> stay at y=1 at turn97\n  Turn97: U -> to y=2 at turn98\n\nNow we are at y=2 (freeway2) at turn98 -> safe.\n\nThen we need to go to y=3 at turn99? Then we check freeway3 at turn99.\n\nFreeway3 at turn99 (delta_t=4):\n  Car1: [-59+6*4, -48+6*4] = [-59+24, -48+24] = [-35,-24] -> safe (0 not in)\n  Car2: [-11+6*4, 0+6*4] = [-11+24, 0+24] = [13,24] -> safe.\n\nThen freeway4 at turn100 (delta_t=5):\n  Car1: [-59+30, -48+30] = [-29,-18] -> safe\n  Car2: [-11+30, 0+30] = [19,30] -> safe.\n\nFreeway5 at turn101 (delta_t=6):\n  Car1: [-59+36, -48+36] = [-23,-12] -> safe\n  Car2: [-11+36, 0+36] = [25,36] -> safe.\n\nFreeway6 at turn102 (delta_t=7):\n  Car1: [-59+42, -48+42] = [-17,-6] -> 0 is not in? But -17<=0<=-6? No, because 0 is greater than -6? Actually, the interval is [-17, -6] meaning from -17 to -6, and 0 is not in that interval -> safe.\n  Car2: [-11+42, 0+42] = [31,42] -> safe.\n\nFreeway7 at turn103 (delta_t=8):\n  Car1: [-59+48, -48+48] = [-11,0] -> 0 is in [-11,0]? Yes, because -11<=0<=0. So collision.\n\nSo we cannot be on freeway7 at turn103.\n\nTherefore, we must avoid being at freeway7 at turn103.\n\nWe are currently planning to be at freeway7 at turn103. How can we avoid that?\n\nWe can adjust the plan from the point we are at. Currently we are at turn98 at y=2. We have to go up to y=3 at turn99, then y=4 at turn100, y=5 at turn101, y=6 at turn102, and then we would go to y=7 at turn103 (which is dangerous).\n\nWe can try to insert a wait somewhere between y=2 and y=7. For example, we can wait at one of the safe rows for an extra turn.\n\nBut note: we must also check that when we wait, we are at a safe row at that turn.\n\nLet's see the next steps:\n\nAt turn98: we are at y=2 (freeway2) and safe.\n\nWe can choose at turn98: \n  Option1: U -> then at turn99 we are at y=3 (freeway3) -> we check at turn99: we did above -> safe.\n  Option2: S -> then at turn99 we are still at y=2 (freeway2). Then we check freeway2 at turn99 (delta_t=4): \n        car: [-83+36*4, -48+36*4] = [-83+144, -48+144] = [61,96] -> safe (0 not in)\n\n  Option3: D -> then at turn99 we go to y=1 (freeway1). Then we check freeway1 at turn99 (delta_t=4):\n        Car1: [37+24,48+24]=[61,72] -> safe\n        Car2: [1+24,12+24]=[25,36] -> safe\n        Car3: [-35+24,-24+24]=[-11,0] -> 0 is in [-11,0]? Yes! So collision.\n\nSo we cannot go down to y=1 at turn99.\n\nSo at turn98, we can only go up or stay.\n\nBut if we stay at turn98 (so remain at y=2 at turn99), then we avoid the problem at freeway7 at turn103? Because then we would be one turn behind.\n\nThen:\n  turn98: S -> stay at y=2 at turn99.\n  turn99: U -> then at turn100 we are at y=3 (freeway3 at turn100) -> check freeway3 at turn100 (delta_t=5):\n        Car1: [-59+30, -48+30] = [-29,-18] -> safe\n        Car2: [-11+30, 0+30] = [19,30] -> safe.\n\n  turn100: U -> to y=4 at turn101 (freeway4 at turn101, delta_t=6):\n        Car1: [-59+36, -48+36] = [-23,-12] -> safe\n        Car2: [-11+36,0+36]=[25,36] -> safe.\n\n  turn101: U -> to y=5 at turn102 (freeway5 at turn102, delta_t=7):\n        Car1: [-59+42, -48+42] = [-17,-6] -> safe\n        Car2: [-11+42,0+42]=[31,42] -> safe.\n\n  turn102: U -> to y=6 at turn103 (freeway6 at turn103, delta_t=8):\n        Car1: [-59+48, -48+48] = [-11,0] -> 0 is in [-11,0] -> collision? \n        But wait: freeway6 at turn103: \n          Car1: [-59+48, -48+48] = [-11,0] -> 0 is in? Yes.\n          Car2: [-11+48,0+48] = [37,48] -> safe.\n\n        So collision on car1 at freeway6 at turn103.\n\nSo we have a collision at freeway6 at turn103? But we are going to be at freeway6 at turn103? Then we have a problem.\n\nBut wait: we are at freeway6 at turn103? We are going from y=5 at turn102 to y=6 at turn103. So at turn103 we are at freeway6.\n\nBut freeway6 at turn103 (delta_t=8) has car1: [-59+48, -48+48] = [-11,0] -> contains 0. So we collide.\n\nTherefore, we cannot be at freeway6 at turn103.\n\nSo we have two problems: freeway7 at turn103 (if we were on schedule) and now freeway6 at turn103 (if we are one turn behind). Actually, we are now behind by one turn.\n\nBut note: if we had not waited at turn96, we would have been at freeway6 at turn102? Then at turn102 (delta_t=7) for freeway6:\n  Car1: [-59+42, -48+42] = [-17,-6] -> safe (0 not in)\n  Car2: [31,42] -> safe.\n\nSo if we are at freeway6 at turn102, it is safe.\n\nBut then we go to freeway7 at turn103 (which we already saw is dangerous: car1 at freeway7 at turn103 (delta_t=8) is [-11,0] -> collision).\n\nSo both schedules have problems at freeway6 and freeway7 at turn103 and turn102? Actually:\n\n- If we are on schedule (without the first wait): \n    turn102: freeway6 -> safe (turn102: delta_t=7 -> freeway6: car1: [-17,-6] safe, car2: [31,42] safe)\n    turn103: freeway7 -> unsafe (car1: [-11,0] at freeway7 at turn103: delta_t=8 -> [-59+48, -48+48] = [-11,0] -> unsafe)\n\n- If we wait one turn at the beginning (at y=1) then we are one turn behind:\n    turn102: freeway5 -> safe (turn102: delta_t=7 -> freeway5: car1: [-17,-6]? Actually, freeway5 at turn102: \n        car1: [-59+42, -48+42] = [-17,-6] -> safe\n        car2: [31,42] -> safe\n    turn103: freeway6 -> unsafe (car1: [-11,0] at freeway6 at turn103: delta_t=8 -> [-59+48, -48+48] = [-11,0] -> unsafe)\n\nBut wait, we have the same problem at freeway6 at turn103? Actually, freeway6 at turn103 is unsafe because of car1.\n\nBut note: the freeways 3 to 8 have the same car configurations? Yes, according to the table.\n\nSo freeway6 at turn103 has the same car1 as freeway7 at turn103? Actually, no: each freeway has its own cars. But they are identical: \n  freeway3: car1: (-48,-59,right,6) -> same as freeway4,5,6,7,8? \n\nBut the problem says for freeway3 to 8: \n  | 3 | (-48,-59,right,6), (0,-11,right,6) |\n  ... same for 4 to 8.\n\nSo the cars on freeway6 at turn103: \n  car1: [-59+6*(103-95), -48+6*8] = [-59+48, -48+48] = [-11,0] -> unsafe.\n\nAnd freeway7 at turn103: same car1? \n  car1: same calculation -> [-11,0] -> unsafe.\n\nSo both freeway6 and freeway7 have a car that covers 0 at turn103? \n\nBut note: the second car on freeway6 at turn103: [ -11+6*8, 0+6*8] = [37,48] -> safe.\n\nSo the problem is car1 on freeway6 and freeway7 at turn103: they both are at [-11,0] at turn103? \n\nActually, no: the car on freeway6 is independent from the car on freeway7. But they are identical and moving at the same speed, so at the same relative time they are at the same positions relative to their starting point? \n\nBut the starting point is at turn95. So at turn103 (delta_t=8), every freeway from 3 to 8 has car1 at [-11,0] and car2 at [37,48]. \n\nTherefore, at turn103, if we are on any freeway from 3 to 8 (i.e., y=3 to y=8) we are unsafe? \n\nBut wait: freeway3 at turn103: \n  car1: [-11,0] -> unsafe\n  car2: [37,48] -> safe.\n\nSo we cannot be on freeway3,4,5,6,7,8 at turn103? \n\nBut we have to pass through these rows. How?\n\nWe must avoid being on any of these freeways at turn103.\n\nSo we must adjust the timing so that we are not on rows 3 to 8 at turn103.\n\nBut note: we are at row 2 at turn98 (if we did the first wait) and we need to get to row 9. We have to go through rows 3 to 8.\n\nWe can try to speed up or slow down.\n\nAlternatively, we can see if there is a safe time to be on these rows.\n\nLet me check the car patterns for freeways 3-8.\n\nFor a freeway k (3<=k<=8), the cars are:\n  car1: span at T: [ -59 + 6*(T-95), -48 + 6*(T-95) ]\n  car2: [ -11 + 6*(T-95), 6*(T-95) ]\n\nWe want 0 to be not in the span of any car at the turn when we are on that freeway.\n\nFor car1: \n  0 is in [ -59+6*delta_t, -48+6*delta_t ] \n    <=> -59+6*delta_t <= 0 <= -48+6*delta_t\n    <=> 6*delta_t >= 59? and 6*delta_t <= 48? -> impossible because 59>48 -> actually, we have:\n        lower bound: -59+6*delta_t <= 0  => 6*delta_t <= 59 -> delta_t <= 59/6 ≈ 9.83 -> delta_t <= 9\n        upper bound: 0 <= -48+6*delta_t => 6*delta_t >=48 => delta_t>=8.\n\nSo for car1: 0 is in the span when 8<= delta_t <=9.\n\nSimilarly, for car2:\n  0 is in [ -11+6*delta_t, 6*delta_t ]\n    <=> -11+6*delta_t <= 0 <= 6*delta_t\n    The second inequality: 0<=6*delta_t -> always true for delta_t>=0.\n    The first: -11+6*delta_t<=0 -> 6*delta_t<=11 -> delta_t<=11/6≈1.83 -> delta_t<=1.\n\nSo car2 is dangerous only when delta_t<=1.\n\nTherefore, for freeways 3-8, the dangerous times for car1 are at delta_t = 8 and 9, and for car2 at delta_t=0 and 1.\n\nBut note: we are starting at delta_t=0 (turn95). We are not on freeways 3-8 at delta_t=0 or 1 because we start at y=0 and move up.\n\nSo car2 is not a problem for us because by the time we get to freeway3, delta_t is at least 3.\n\nBut car1 is dangerous at delta_t=8 and 9.\n\nSo we must avoid being on freeways 3-8 at turns 95+8=103 and 95+9=104.\n\nTherefore, we cannot be on any of the freeways 3-8 at turns 103 and 104.\n\nNow, what about freeway2? We already saw it was dangerous at turn97 (delta_t=2) but safe at turn98 (delta_t=3) and beyond.\n\nFreeway1: we saw it was safe at turn96 and turn97 (and also at turn98? Let me check freeway1 at turn98 (delta_t=3):\n  Car1: [37+18,48+18]=[55,66] -> safe\n  Car2: [1+18,12+18]=[19,30] -> safe\n  Car3: [-35+18,-24+18]=[-17,-6] -> safe.\n\nSo freeway1 is safe for delta_t>=2? Actually, car3: \n  It is dangerous when 0 is in [-35+6*delta_t, -24+6*delta_t]\n    => -35+6*delta_t<=0<=-24+6*delta_t\n    => 6*delta_t>=35 and 6*delta_t>=24 -> the binding constraint: \n        6*delta_t>=35 -> delta_t>=35/6≈5.83 -> so delta_t>=6\n        and 0<=-24+6*delta_t -> 6*delta_t>=24 -> delta_t>=4.\n    So for delta_t>=6, the car3 becomes dangerous? \n\nCheck at delta_t=6: \n  car3: [-35+36, -24+36] = [1,12] -> 0 not in [1,12] -> safe.\nAt delta_t=5: [-35+30, -24+30] = [-5,6] -> 0 in [-5,6] -> dangerous.\n\nSo freeway1 at delta_t=5 (turn100) is dangerous because of car3.\n\nBut we are not planning to be on freeway1 at turn100? We are going up and then we are beyond freeway1.\n\nSimilarly, freeway2: we saw at delta_t=2 (turn97) was dangerous, but at delta_t=3 (turn98) was safe. What about later?\n  The car on freeway2: [-83+36*delta_t, -48+36*delta_t]\n  We want 0 to be in that interval?\n    -83+36*delta_t <= 0 <= -48+36*delta_t\n    The second: 0<=-48+36*delta_t -> 36*delta_t>=48 -> delta_t>=48/36=4/3≈1.33 -> so for delta_t>=2.\n    The first: -83+36*delta_t<=0 -> 36*delta_t<=83 -> delta_t<=83/36≈2.305 -> so for delta_t<=2.\n    Therefore, dangerous only at delta_t=2.\n\nSo freeway2 is dangerous only at turn97 (delta_t=2).\n\nNow, to avoid the danger at freeways 3-8 at turns103 and104, we must not be on any freeway from 3 to 8 at those turns.\n\nWe have two options: \n  Option A: Pass through freeways 3-8 before turn103 or after turn104.\n  Option B: Be on a freeway that is not 3-8? But no, because 3-8 are the only freeways in that range.\n\nWe must schedule so that we are on freeway3 at a turn that is not 103 or 104, similarly for 4,5,6,7,8.\n\nBut note: we can only move one row per turn (unless we do multiple waits, but that would increase H).\n\nWe need to traverse from row2 to row9. That requires 7 steps (rows 3,4,5,6,7,8,9). But note: when we step on row9, we are done and not on a freeway.\n\nSo we need 7 turns to go from row2 to row9.\n\nWe must start from row2 at some turn T, then we will be:\n  T: row2\n  T+1: row3\n  T+2: row4\n  T+3: row5\n  T+4: row6\n  T+5: row7\n  T+6: row8\n  T+7: row9 -> done.\n\nWe must avoid having T+1, T+2, T+3, T+4, T+5, T+6 being 103 or 104? Actually, we must avoid any of the turns in the interval [T+1, T+6] being 103 or 104.\n\nBut note: if T+1=103, then we are at row3 at turn103 -> unsafe.\nIf T+1=104, then row3 at turn104 -> unsafe (because at turn104, delta_t=9, and car1 on freeway3 is at [-59+54, -48+54]=[-5,6] -> and 0 in [-5,6]? \n  Actually, at delta_t=9: car1: [-59+54, -48+54] = [-5,6] -> 0 is in [-5,6] -> unsafe.\n\nSo we cannot be on any row from 3 to 8 at turns 103 and 104.\n\nTherefore, the entire interval [T+1, T+6] must not include 103 or 104.\n\nWe can set T such that T+1 > 104 or T+6 < 103.\n\nBut T+6 < 103 -> T < 97.\nBut we are currently at row2 at turn98 (if we did the first wait). So T=98, then T+6=104 -> which includes 103 and 104? \n  T+1=99 (row3), T+2=100, T+3=101, T+4=102, T+5=103 (row7 -> unsafe), T+6=104 (row8 -> unsafe).\n\nSo we cannot start at T=98.\n\nWe must start earlier or later.\n\nBut we started at turn95 at row0. We are now at row2 at turn98. How can we start earlier? We can't because we had to avoid freeway2 at turn97.\n\nAlternatively, we can wait longer at row2? Then we start the ascent later.\n\nLet T be the turn when we are at row2 and then we start going up.\n\nWe want the entire ascent (from row2 to row9) to avoid turns 103 and 104.\n\nThat means the turns for rows 3 to 8 must be not in {103,104}.\n\nThe ascent takes 6 turns (from row2 to row8) and then the next turn we go to row9 and are done.\n\nWe require:\n  The turn for row3: T+1 not in {103,104}\n  row4: T+2 not in {103,104}\n  ...\n  row8: T+6 not in {103,104}\n\nSo T+1, T+2, ..., T+6 must be not 103 and not 104.\n\nWe can set T such that T+6 < 103 -> T<97, but we are at row2 at turn98 -> T=98 -> too late.\n\nOr T+1 > 104 -> T>=104.\n\nSo we can start the ascent at turn104 or later.\n\nThat means we would be at row2 until turn104 (or later) and then start going up.\n\nBut we are at row2 at turn98. How do we get to row2 and stay until turn104?\n\nWe can stay at row2 for several turns, but we must check that row2 is safe at every turn we are there.\n\nRow2 has only one car: (-48,-83,right,36). We are safe at row2 if 0 is not in the span of that car at that turn.\n\nThe car: [ -83+36*delta_t, -48+36*delta_t ]\n\nWe are at row2 at turn T, so we require:\n  not ( -83+36*(T-95) <= 0 <= -48+36*(T-95) )\n\nWe know it's dangerous only at T=97 (delta_t=2). For other turns? \n\nCheck:\n  At T=98: delta_t=3 -> [ -83+108, -48+108] = [25,60] -> safe.\n  T=99: delta_t=4 -> [ -83+144, -48+144] = [61,96] -> safe.\n  T=100: delta_t=5 -> [ -83+180, -48+180] = [97,132] -> safe.\n  T=101: delta_t=6 -> [ -83+216, -48+216] = [133,168] -> safe.\n  T=102: delta_t=7 -> [ -83+252, -48+252] = [169,204] -> safe.\n  T=103: delta_t=8 -> [ -83+288, -48+288] = [205,240] -> safe.\n  T=104: delta_t=9 -> [ -83+324, -48+324] = [241,276] -> safe.\n\nSo row2 is safe for all turns from 98 onward.\n\nTherefore, we can stay at row2 until we are ready to start the ascent.\n\nWe plan to start the ascent at turn104.\n\nAt turn104, we are at row2. Then:\n\n  turn104: U -> to row3 at turn105 -> check freeway3 at turn105: delta_t=10.\n      car1: [-59+60, -48+60] = [1,12] -> safe (0 not in)\n      car2: [-11+60,0+60]=[49,60] -> safe.\n\n  turn105: U -> to row4 at turn106: freeway4 at turn106, delta_t=11:\n      car1: [-59+66, -48+66] = [7,18] -> safe.\n      car2: [-11+66,0+66]=[55,66] -> safe.\n\n  turn106: U -> to row5 at turn107: freeway5, delta_t=12:\n      car1: [-59+72, -48+72]=[13,24] -> safe.\n      car2: [-11+72,0+72]=[61,72] -> safe.\n\n  turn107: U -> to row6 at turn108: freeway6, delta_t=13:\n      car1: [-59+78, -48+78]=[19,30] -> safe.\n      car2: [-11+78,0+78]=[67,78] -> safe.\n\n  turn108: U -> to row7 at turn109: freeway7, delta_t=14:\n      car1: [-59+84, -48+84]=[25,36] -> safe.\n      car2: [-11+84,0+84]=[73,84] -> safe.\n\n  turn109: U -> to row8 at turn110: freeway8, delta_t=15:\n      car1: [-59+90, -48+90]=[31,42] -> safe.\n      car2: [-11+90,0+90]=[79,90] -> safe.\n\n  turn110: U -> to row9 at turn111 -> done.\n\nBut wait, we are done at turn111? We are at row9 at turn111.\n\nBut is that minimal? We are using many turns.\n\nWe started at turn95 at row0.\nWe went:\n  turn95: U -> row1 at turn96\n  turn96: S -> row1 at turn97\n  turn97: U -> row2 at turn98\n  then we stay at row2 from turn98 to turn104? That's 6 turns (from turn98 to turn103) staying at row2? \n\nActually, from turn98 to turn104: we are at row2 at turn98, and we want to stay until turn104? That means we stay for 6 more turns (turns98,99,100,101,102,103) at row2? \n\nThen at turn104: we start moving up.\n\nSo the actions from turn98 to turn103 are all S (stay). Then turn104: U, and so on.\n\nBut we are at row2 at turn98. We need to stay for turns98,99,100,101,102,103: that's 6 turns. Then at turn104 we go to row3.\n\nSo the total turns from turn95 to turn111 is 111-95+1? Actually, we are counting the turns we take actions:\n\n  We take actions from turn95 to turn110 (16 turns) and then at turn111 we are at row9.\n\nBut note: at turn95 we take an action to move to row1 at turn96.\nAt turn110 we take an action to move to row9 at turn111.\n\nSo we need 16 actions? \n\nBut let's list the actions:\n\n  turn95: U\n  turn96: S\n  turn97: U\n  turn98: S\n  turn99: S\n  turn100: S\n  turn101: S\n  turn102: S\n  turn103: S   (staying at row2 for 6 turns: turns98 to turn103 inclusive? Actually, we are at row2 at turn98. Then we choose actions at turn98,99,100,101,102,103 to stay. Then at turn104 we go up.)\n\n  Then:\n  turn104: U\n  turn105: U\n  turn106: U\n  turn107: U\n  turn108: U\n  turn109: U\n  turn110: U\n\nThat's 7 actions for the ascent.\n\nTotal actions: \n  turn95: U\n  turn96: S\n  turn97: U\n  then 6 S (turns98-103)\n  then 7 U (turns104-110)\n\nTotal: 1+1+1+6+7 = 16 turns.\n\nBut is there a shorter path?\n\nWe could try to start the ascent earlier if we can avoid the dangerous turns by waiting at an intermediate row.\n\nFor example, we could go up to row3 earlier and then wait at row3 until after turn104? But row3 at turn103: dangerous (car1: [-11,0]) -> so we cannot wait at row3 during turn103.\n\nSimilarly, any freeway from 3 to 8 is dangerous at turn103 and turn104.\n\nSo we cannot be on any of them during those turns.\n\nAlternatively, we could go up to row9 without waiting so long, but we have to skip the dangerous turns.\n\nThe minimal time would be if we can be at row2 until turn102, then start the ascent at turn102? Then:\n\n  turn102: at row2 -> safe (as we saw, row2 at turn102 is safe)\n  turn102: U -> to row3 at turn103 -> but turn103 is dangerous for row3 -> collision.\n\nIf we start at turn104, then row3 at turn105 is safe.\n\nBut we are at row2 from turn98 to turn103: that's 6 turns of waiting.\n\nIs there a way to not wait that long?\n\nWe could go up to row1 and wait there for some turns? But we are already at row2 at turn98.\n\nAlternatively, we could have taken a different initial path.\n\nWhat if we didn't wait at the beginning? Then we would be at row2 at turn97 -> which is dangerous for freeway2.\n\nSo we had to wait at row1 for one turn.\n\nBut could we have waited longer at row1? \n\nFor example:\n\n  turn95: U -> row1 at turn96 (safe)\n  turn96: S -> row1 at turn97 (safe)\n  turn97: S -> row1 at turn98 (freeway1 at turn98: safe, as we computed)\n  turn98: U -> row2 at turn99 (freeway2 at turn99: safe, because at delta_t=4: [61,96] -> safe)\n  turn99: U -> row3 at turn100 (freeway3 at turn100: safe? at delta_t=5: car1: [-29,-18] safe, car2: [19,30] safe)\n\n  then continue:\n  turn100: U -> row4 at turn101: freeway4 at turn101 (delta_t=6): safe? car1: [-23,-12] safe, car2: [25,36] safe.\n  turn101: U -> row5 at turn102: freeway5 at turn102 (delta_t=7): safe? car1: [-17,-6] safe, car2: [31,42] safe.\n  turn102: U -> row6 at turn103: freeway6 at turn103: unsafe (car1: [-11,0]) -> collision.\n\nSo we still hit at turn103.\n\nWe could then wait at row5 at turn102? But then we are at row5 at turn102 (safe) and then at turn102 we stay? Then at turn103 we are at row5 (freeway5) at turn103: \n  freeway5 at turn103 (delta_t=8): car1: [-11,0] -> unsafe.\n\nSo we cannot be at row5 at turn103 either.\n\nWe must avoid any freeway from 3 to 8 at turn103 and turn104.\n\nSo the only safe option is to be at row2 until at least turn104.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 16 turns? But note: we start at turn95 and take actions for turns95,96,...,110 (16 actions) and then at turn111 we are at row9.\n\nBut is there a way to do it in fewer turns?\n\nWhat if we start the ascent earlier but skip one row by going down and then up? But that would cost extra turns.\n\nAlternatively, we could go down to row0 and wait there? But row0 is not a freeway, so it's safe. But then we have to go up again.\n\nFor example:\n\n  We are at row2 at turn98.\n  We could go down to row1 at turn99? But freeway1 at turn99: we saw car3 at turn99 (delta_t=4) is safe? \n      At turn99: delta_t=4: \n        car1: [37+24,48+24]=[61,72] safe\n        car2: [1+24,12+24]=[25,36] safe\n        car3: [-35+24,-24+24]=[-11,0] -> 0 is in [-11,0] -> unsafe.\n\n  So we cannot go to row1 at turn99.\n\n  We could go down to row0 at turn99: then at turn99 we are at row0 (safe, not freeway). Then we can wait at row0 for several turns.\n\n  But then we have to go up again: \n      turn99: D -> to row1 at turn100? \n          At turn100, we are at row1: freeway1 at turn100 (delta_t=5): \n              car3: [-35+30, -24+30] = [-5,6] -> 0 is in [-5,6] -> unsafe.\n\n  So we cannot be at row1 at turn100 either.\n\n  How long is row1 dangerous? \n      car3: dangerous when 4<=delta_t<=5? \n          delta_t=4: [-11,0] -> unsafe\n          delta_t=5: [-5,6] -> unsafe\n          delta_t=6: [1,12] -> safe.\n\n  So we can be at row1 at turn101 (delta_t=6) or later.\n\n  So we could:\n      turn98: at row2\n      turn98: D -> to row1 at turn99 -> unsafe (row1 at turn99: delta_t=4 -> unsafe)\n      so we cannot do that.\n\n  Alternatively, we could go down to row0 at turn98: \n        turn98: D -> to row1? No, we are at row2 at turn98. If we choose D at turn98, we go to row1 at turn99 -> unsafe.\n\n  We must avoid row1 at turn98 and turn99? But we are already at row2.\n\n  So the only safe place to wait is row2 or row0? But row0 is safe, but we have to get there safely.\n\n  How to get to row0 from row2?\n      We are at row2 at turn98 (safe).\n      turn98: D -> to row1 at turn99 -> unsafe (row1 at turn99 is unsafe).\n      turn98: DD? We can't do two actions in one turn.\n\n  So we cannot get to row0 from row2 without going through row1 at a dangerous time.\n\nTherefore, the only safe place to wait is row2.\n\nSo we must wait at row2 until turn104.\n\nThus, the minimal number of turns is 16.\n\nNow, let's write the actions:\n\n  Turn95: U\n  Turn96: S\n  Turn97: U\n  Turn98: S\n  Turn99: S\n  Turn100: S\n  Turn101: S\n  Turn102: S\n  Turn103: S\n  Turn104: U\n  Turn105: U\n  Turn106: U\n  Turn107: U\n  Turn108: U\n  Turn109: U\n  Turn110: U\n\nBut note: after turn110: we are at row9 at turn111.\n\nBut the problem asks for the sequence of actions from turn95 to the turn that we reach row9. The last action is at turn110 which moves us to row9 at turn111.\n\nSo we need 16 actions.\n\nBut let me count the turns: \n  We take actions at turns: 95,96,97,98,99,100,101,102,103,104,105,106,107,108,109,110 -> 16 turns.\n\nWe start at turn95 at (0,0). After 16 actions, we are at (0,9) at turn111.\n\nBut the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\". And the sequence is from t=0 to H-1? \n\nThe problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning that we take actions at t1, t1+1, ... t1+H-1, and then at the next turn we are at (0,9).\n\nSo H is the number of actions.\n\nWe have 16 actions.\n\nBut is there a way with fewer?\n\nNote: we must go from 0 to 9: at least 9 moves of 'U'. And we have to avoid the dangerous times. We have 16 actions, which includes 9 U's and 7 non-U's (S or D). But we used 1 D? No, we didn't use any D. We used 2 U's initially and then 7 U's at the end, and the rest are S.\n\nTotal U: 2 (at 95 and 97) and then 7 (from 104 to 110) -> 9 U's.\nTotal S: 1 (at96) and 6 (98-103) -> 7 S's.\n\nTotal 16.\n\nBut can we reduce the waiting time? \n\nWe have to avoid being on freeways 3-8 at turns103 and104. The next safe time for these freeways is at turn105 (delta_t=10) and beyond.\n\nWe are at row2 at turn98. We need to start the ascent at turn104 (so that we are at row3 at turn105). That means we wait at row2 from turn98 to turn103: 6 turns.\n\nBut what if we can start the ascent earlier by not going to row2 until later? But we are already at row2 at turn98.\n\nAlternatively, we could have taken more initial waiting.\n\nFor example, at the beginning we could have waited at row0? \n\nWe start at row0 at turn95 (safe). \n  turn95: S -> remain at row0 at turn96 (safe)\n  turn96: U -> row1 at turn97 (freeway1 at turn97: safe, as before)\n  turn97: S -> row1 at turn98 (freeway1 at turn98: safe)\n  turn98: U -> row2 at turn99 (freeway2 at turn99: safe)\n  then we are at row2 at turn99.\n\nBut then we still have to wait at row2 until turn104? That would be from turn99 to turn103: 5 turns of waiting, so total turns would be the same? \n\nActually, we used one extra initial wait (at turn95: S) so we are one turn behind.\n\nThen we start the ascent at turn104 (from row2) and we need 7 U's -> we finish at turn110 (last action) and then at turn111 we are at row9.\n\nBut the number of actions is 17: \n  turn95: S\n  turn96: U\n  turn97: S\n  turn98: U\n  then 5 S at row2 (turns99-103)\n  then 7 U (turns104-110)\n\nTotal: 1+1+1+1+5+7 = 16? \n  Actually: \n      turn95: S\n      turn96: U\n      turn97: S\n      turn98: U -> to row2 at turn99\n      turn99: S\n      turn100: S\n      turn101: S\n      turn102: S\n      turn103: S\n      turn104: U\n      ... until turn110: U -> then at turn111: row9.\n\n  So 16 actions? But we started one turn later.\n\n  The sequence is the same length? Because we replaced the first U (at95) with S, and then we did U at96 and then we did U at98 (which was the same as U at97 in the original) and then we had one less wait at row2 (because we started at row2 one turn later). \n\n  In the original we had 6 waits at row2 (turns98-103: 6 actions of S) and in this new we have 5 waits (turns99-103: 5 actions of S). But we added one S at turn95.\n\n  So total: \n      Original: 9 U's and 7 S's -> 16\n      New: 9 U's and 6 S's? \n          Actions: \n            turn95: S\n            turn96: U\n            turn97: S\n            turn98: U\n            turns99-103: S (5 times)\n            turns104-110: U (7 times)\n          Total: 2+5+7 = 14? No: \n            S: 1 (95) + 1 (97) + 5 (99-103) = 7 S's\n            U: 1 (96) + 1 (98) + 7 (104-110) = 9 U's\n          Total 16.\n\n  So same.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 16.\n\nSo we'll output the sequence we first planned:\n\nTurn95: U\nTurn96: S\nTurn97: U\nTurn98: S\nTurn99: S\nTurn100: S\nTurn101: S\nTurn102: S\nTurn103: S\nTurn104: U\nTurn105: U\nTurn106: U\nTurn107: U\nTurn108: U\nTurn109: U\nTurn110: U\n\nBut wait, we have to check the entire path for collisions.\n\nLet me verify:\n\nTurn95: action U -> at turn96: y=1 (freeway1). Check freeway1 at turn96 (delta_t=1):\n  Car1: [37+6,48+6]=[43,54] safe\n  Car2: [1+6,12+6]=[7,18] safe\n  Car3: [-35+6,-24+6]=[-29,-18] safe.\n\nTurn96: action S -> at turn97: y=1 (freeway1). Check freeway1 at turn97 (delta_t=2):\n  Car1: [37+12,48+12]=[49,60] safe\n  Car2: [1+12,12+12]=[13,24] safe\n  Car3: [-35+12,-24+12]=[-23,-12] safe.\n\nTurn97: action U -> at turn98: y=2 (freeway2). Check freeway2 at turn98 (delta_t=3):\n  Car: [-83+108, -48+108]=[25,60] safe.\n\nThen from turn98 to turn103: we do S each time -> remain at y=2.\n  We already checked freeway2 at turns98 to 104: all safe.\n\nTurn104: action U -> at turn105: y=3 (freeway3). Check at turn105 (delta_t=10):\n  Car1: [-59+60, -48+60]=[1,12] safe\n  Car2: [-11+60,0+60]=[49,60] safe.\n\nTurn105: U -> at106: y=4 (freeway4) at delta_t=11:\n  Car1: [-59+66, -48+66]=[7,18] safe\n  Car2: [-11+66,0+66]=[55,66] safe.\n\nTurn106: U -> at107: y=5 (freeway5) at delta_t=12:\n  Car1: [-59+72, -48+72]=[13,24] safe\n  Car2: [-11+72,0+72]=[61,72] safe.\n\nTurn107: U -> at108: y=6 (freeway6) at delta_t=13:\n  Car1: [-59+78, -48+78]=[19,30] safe\n  Car2: [-11+78,0+78]=[67,78] safe.\n\nTurn108: U -> at109: y=7 (freeway7) at delta_t=14:\n  Car1: [-59+84, -48+84]=[25,36] safe\n  Car2: [-11+84,0+84]=[73,84] safe.\n\nTurn109: U -> at110: y=8 (freeway8) at delta_t=15:\n  Car1: [-59+90, -48+90]=[31,42] safe\n  Car2: [-11+90,0+90]=[79,90] safe.\n\nTurn110: U -> at111: y=9 -> done.\n\nSo no collisions.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 16, and the sequence is as above.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\". Is there a sequence with H=15? \n\nSuppose we try to reduce by one wait. That means we start the ascent at turn103 instead of turn104.\n\nThen we would be at row3 at turn104? But turn104 is dangerous for row3? \n  freeway3 at turn104 (delta_t=9): car1: [-59+54, -48+54] = [-5,6] -> 0 in [-5,6] -> unsafe.\n\nSo we cannot.\n\nIf we start at turn103: then at turn103 we go to row3 -> unsafe.\n\nIf we start at turn102: then at turn102 we go to row3 at turn103 -> unsafe.\n\nSo we must start at turn104.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 16.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 95: U\nTurn 96: S\nTurn 97: U\nTurn 98: S\nTurn 99: S\nTurn 100: S\nTurn 101: S\nTurn 102: S\nTurn 103: S\nTurn 104: U\nTurn 105: U\nTurn 106: U\nTurn 107: U\nTurn 108: U\nTurn 109: U\nTurn 110: U\n}\n\nNote: the turn numbers are given as t_1 (which is 95) and then the subsequent turns.\n\nWe write the actions for turns 95 to 110.\n</think>\nThe minimal sequence of actions to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn 95, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), requires 16 turns. The sequence is as follows:\n\n- At turn 95, move up to \\(y = 1\\) (safe, as freeway 1 at turn 96 is collision-free).\n- At turn 96, stay at \\(y = 1\\) (safe, as freeway 1 at turn 97 is collision-free).\n- At turn 97, move up to \\(y = 2\\) (safe, as freeway 2 at turn 98 is collision-free).\n- From turns 98 to 103, stay at \\(y = 2\\) (safe, as freeway 2 remains collision-free for these turns).\n- From turns 104 to 110, move up consecutively to reach \\(y = 9\\) by turn 111 (safe, as freeways 3 to 8 are collision-free at the respective turns due to the time shift avoiding dangerous intervals).\n\nThe sequence ensures no collisions:\n- Freeway 1 at turns 96 and 97 is safe (cars do not cover \\(x = 0\\)).\n- Freeway 2 at turns 98 to 103 is safe (car does not cover \\(x = 0\\)).\n- Freeways 3 to 8 at turns 105 to 110 are safe (cars do not cover \\(x = 0\\) at \\(\\Delta t = 10\\) to \\(15\\)).\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn } 95: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 96: \\text{ S} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 97: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 98: \\text{ S} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 99: \\text{ S} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 100: \\text{ S} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 101: \\text{ S} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 102: \\text{ S} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 103: \\text{ S} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 104: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 105: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 106: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 107: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 108: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 109: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 110: \\text{ U}\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at position (0, 1) at turn t_1 = 97. The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimum number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. Each action U, D, or S changes the y-position by +1, -1, or 0, respectively, and y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nThe collision rule is important: collision occurs at turn T only if the player is on a freeway y_T (between 1 and 8) and at that turn, for the car on that freeway, 0 is in the span of the car. The span is given for each car, and it moves left or right based on direction and speed.\n\nAlso, note that when moving to a new y, you're not on that new y until the next turn. So if you move from y to y+1 at turn T, you're still on y at turn T, and you arrive at y+1 at turn T+1. So for collision check at turn T, you only care about the freeway you're currently on at that turn.\n\nThe car states are given for turn t_1=97. For each freeway k from 1 to 8, there are cars listed with head, tail, direction, and speed.\n\nI need to find a sequence of actions starting from t_1 to reach y=9 as quickly as possible, avoiding any collision on the way.\n\nSince y starts at 1 and needs to go to 9, the minimum number of moves without any obstacles would be 8 Up moves, so H=8 turns. But with cars, it might take longer if we have to wait or detour.\n\nBut in this case, we can only move up, down, or stay, so we might need to stay or move down to avoid cars, but since we need to go up, moving down might not be efficient, but it could be necessary to avoid a collision.\n\nFirst, let's understand the car movements. All cars are moving right, according to the data. Direction is \"right\" for all cars listed.\n\nFor right-moving cars, the span moves to the right over time. The span at time T is [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)] for right-moving, as per the update rule.\n\nIn the update: for right-moving, span at T is [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nSimilarly for left, but all are right here.\n\nt_1 is 97.\n\nNow, collision occurs at turn T if player is on freeway k, and 0 is in the span of a car on that freeway at that turn.\n\n0 is the x-position, since we're at (0, y), so x=0 always for player.\n\nSo for a given freeway k and turn T, if there is a car on k such that 0 is between τ + s(T-t_1) and h + s(T-t_1) inclusive? The span is [min, max], so if 0 >= min and 0 <= max, I think.\n\nIn the span definition, for right-moving, it's [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT], and since τ is tail and h is head, and right-moving, I assume τ <= h, so the span is from smaller to larger: [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT], so min is τ + sΔT, max is h + sΔT.\n\nThen 0 is in span if τ + sΔT <= 0 <= h + sΔT.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but all are right here.\n\nΔT = T - t_1.\n\nt_1 = 97.\n\nNow, let's list all cars for each freeway.\n\nFrom the table:\n\nFreeway 1: cars: (60,49,right,6), (24,13,right,6), (-12,-23,right,6)\n\nBut head and tail: for the first car, head=60, tail=49? That seems odd because for right-moving, head should be greater than tail if it's moving right. 60>49, so head=60, tail=49, so the car is from 49 to 60? But usually tail is behind, but in terms of position, if moving right, tail is left, head is right.\n\nIn the span definition, for right-moving, initial span [τ, h] with τ <= h, I think.\n\nIn freeway 1, first car (60,49,right,6): h=60, τ=49, so τ=49 < h=60, so span at t_1: [49,60]\n\nThen at T, [49 + 6(T-97), 60 + 6(T-97)]\n\nSimilarly, second car (24,13,right,6): τ=13, h=24, span [13,24] at t_1, at T: [13+6(T-97), 24+6(T-97)]\n\nThird car (-12,-23,right,6): τ=-23, h=-12, span [-23,-12] at t_1, at T: [-23+6(T-97), -12+6(T-97)]\n\nNow freeway 2: only one car (24,-11,right,36)\n\nτ=-11, h=24, so span [-11,24] at t_1, at T: [-11 + 36(T-97), 24 + 36(T-97)]\n\nFreeway 3: cars (-36,-47,right,6) and (12,1,right,6)\n\nFirst car: τ=-47, h=-36, span [-47,-36] at t_1\n\nAt T: [-47+6(T-97), -36+6(T-97)]\n\nSecond car: τ=1, h=12, span [1,12] at t_1, at T: [1+6(T-97), 12+6(T-97)]\n\nFreeway 4 to 8: all have the same cars: (-36,-47,right,6) and (12,1,right,6)\n\nIn the table, for freeway 4,5,6,7,8, it's identical to freeway 3.\n\nFreeway 3: (-36,-47,right,6), (12,1,right,6)\n\nAnd same for 4,5,6,7,8.\n\nBut freeway 1 and 2 are different.\n\nFreeway 1 has three cars, freeway 2 has one, freeways 3-8 have two each, all right-moving.\n\nNow, player starts at y=1 at turn t_1=97.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nThe freeways are y=1 to y=8, each must be crossed or occupied when moving.\n\nSince player moves vertically, when on a freeway, we need to ensure that at that turn, for that y, 0 is not in any car span on that freeway.\n\nNow, to minimize turns, we want to move up as much as possible, but avoid collisions.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway and for each future turn, when 0 is occupied by a car.\n\nThat is, for each k and T, if there is a car on k such that τ + s(T-97) <= 0 <= h + s(T-97)\n\nSince s and ΔT, we can solve for when 0 is in the interval.\n\nLet ΔT = T - 97.\n\nFor a car with τ, h, s, 0 is in span at T if τ + s ΔT <= 0 <= h + s ΔT\n\nWhich is equivalent to: -h/s <= ΔT <= -τ/s ? Let's see.\n\nτ + s ΔT <= 0 <= h + s ΔT\n\nFrom left: τ + s ΔT <= 0 => s ΔT <= -τ => ΔT <= -τ/s (since s>0)\n\nFrom right: 0 <= h + s ΔT => s ΔT >= -h => ΔT >= -h/s\n\nAnd since h > τ usually, -h/s < -τ/s, so the condition is ΔT >= -h/s and ΔT <= -τ/s\n\nΔT >= ceil(-h/s) and ΔT <= floor(-τ/s) ? But since positions are integers, and time is integer, we need to handle the inequalities.\n\nSince the span is inclusive, and positions are integers, we can find integer ΔT where the inequality holds.\n\nFor example, for a car, the times when 0 is covered.\n\nBut for each freeway, there might be multiple cars, so we need the union of times when some car covers 0.\n\nThen, for that freeway, at times when no car covers 0, it is safe to be on that freeway.\n\nOtherwise, unsafe.\n\nThen for the player, when moving to a freeway, we need to be on it only when it is safe.\n\nNow, since we start at y=1 at turn 97, and we need to reach y=9, which is not a freeway, I think. Freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\ny=0 is the bottom, y=9 is the top, no cars there, so only when on y=1 to 8, we need to worry.\n\nPlayer starts at (0,1), so at turn 97, on freeway y=1.\n\nSimilarly, at turn when we reach y=9, we are done, no issue.\n\nNow, let's compute for each freeway the set of turns T where it is unsafe, i.e., some car covers x=0.\n\nFirst, freeway y=1.\n\nCars:\n\n1. (h=60, τ=49, s=6)\n\nSo ΔT >= -h/s = -60/6 = -10\n\nΔT <= -τ/s = -49/6 ≈ -8.166, so since ΔT integer, ΔT <= -9? Let's compute.\n\nΔT >= ceil(-h/s) and ΔT <= floor(-τ/s)? Better to compute the bounds.\n\n0 in span if τ + s ΔT <= 0 <= h + s ΔT\n\nSo for car 1: 49 + 6 ΔT <= 0 <= 60 + 6 ΔT\n\nFirst inequality: 49 + 6ΔT <= 0 => 6ΔT <= -49 => ΔT <= -49/6 ≈ -8.166, so ΔT <= -9 since ΔT integer? -49/6 = -8.166, so 6ΔT <= -49, since -49 not divisible by 6, ΔT <= floor(-49/6) = floor(-8.166) = -9? Let's calculate:\n\n6ΔT <= -49, so ΔT <= -49/6 ≈ -8.166, so for integer ΔT, ΔT <= -9? For example, ΔT=-9, 6*(-9)= -54 <= -49? -54 < -49, yes -54 <= -49 is true since -54 is smaller.\n\n-54 <= -49 is true because -54 is less than -49.\n\nSimilarly, 0 <= 60 + 6ΔT: 0 <= 60 + 6ΔT => 6ΔT >= -60 => ΔT >= -10\n\nSo for car 1, 0 in span when ΔT >= -10 and ΔT <= -9? Let's list:\n\nΔT >= -10: from 6ΔT >= -60\n\nΔT <= -9: from 6ΔT <= -49, since 6*(-9) = -54 <= -49, true; 6*(-8) = -48 > -49? -48 > -49, so -48 <= -49 is false, so only for ΔT <= -9.\n\nΔT <= -9 means ΔT = ..., -11, -10, -9\n\nFor ΔT = -9: 6*(-9) = -54, so τ + sΔT = 49 + (-54) = -5 <=0, and h + sΔT =60 -54=6 >=0, so 0 between -5 and 6, yes.\n\nFor ΔT = -10: 49 + 6*(-10) = 49-60= -11 <=0, 60-60=0 <=0, so 0 is included.\n\nFor ΔT = -11: 49-66= -17 <=0, 60-66= -6 <=0, 0 >= -6? 0 <= h+sΔT is 0 <= -6? False, because -6 <0.\n\n0 <= h + sΔT: for ΔT=-11, h+sΔT=60-66=-6 <0, so 0 <= -6 is false.\n\nSimilarly, τ + sΔT =49-66=-17 <=0 true, but 0 <= -6 false, so not in span.\n\nΔT <= -9 means ΔT = -9, -10, -11, ... but for ΔT=-10: sΔT=6*(-10)=-60, τ+sΔT=49-60=-11 <=0, h+sΔT=60-60=0, so 0 <=0 true.\n\nΔT=-9: τ+sΔT=49-54=-5<=0, h+sΔT=60-54=6>=0, 0<=6 true.\n\nΔT=-8: τ+sΔT=49-48=1>0? 1 <=0? False, because τ+sΔT=1 >0, so not <=0.\n\nSimilarly, h+sΔT=60-48=12>0.\n\nSo for car 1, 0 in span only for ΔT <= -9 and ΔT >= -10, so ΔT = -10 and ΔT = -9.\n\nΔT = T - 97, so for T=97 + ΔT.\n\nWhen ΔT = -10, T=97-10=87\n\nΔT = -9, T=97-9=88\n\nSo at turns 87 and 88, car 1 covers x=0 on freeway 1.\n\nBut we are at turn 97, which is later, so for future turns, ΔT >=0, so for ΔT=0 and above, this car does not cover 0.\n\nSimilarly, second car on y=1: (h=24, τ=13, s=6)\n\n0 in span if 13 + 6ΔT <= 0 <= 24 + 6ΔT\n\nFirst: 13 + 6ΔT <= 0 => 6ΔT <= -13 => ΔT <= -13/6 ≈ -2.166, so ΔT <= -3? Let's see.\n\n6ΔT <= -13, so ΔT <= ceil(-13/6) or floor? -13/6 = -2.166, so ΔT <= -3? For ΔT=-3, 6*(-3)= -18 <= -13 true; ΔT=-2, 6*(-2)= -12 > -13? -12 > -13, so -12 <= -13 false, so ΔT <= -3.\n\nSecond: 0 <= 24 + 6ΔT => 6ΔT >= -24 => ΔT >= -4\n\nSo ΔT >= -4 and ΔT <= -3\n\nΔT = -4, -3\n\nFor ΔT=-4: τ+sΔT=13-24= -11 <=0, h+sΔT=24-24=0 <=0 true.\n\nΔT=-3: 13-18= -5<=0, 24-18=6>=0.\n\nΔT=-2: 13-12=1>0, not <=0.\n\nSo at turns T=97 + (-4) =93 and T=97 + (-3)=94, unsafe.\n\nBut again, past turns, not relevant for future.\n\nThird car on y=1: (h=-12, τ=-23, s=6)\n\n0 in span: τ + sΔT <= 0 <= h + sΔT\n\n-23 + 6ΔT <= 0 <= -12 + 6ΔT\n\nFirst: -23 + 6ΔT <= 0 => 6ΔT <= 23 => ΔT <= 23/6 ≈ 3.833, so ΔT <= 3\n\nSecond: 0 <= -12 + 6ΔT => 6ΔT >= 12 => ΔT >= 2\n\nSo ΔT >=2 and ΔT <=3\n\nThus for ΔT=2,3\n\nT=97+2=99 and T=97+3=100\n\nSo at turns 99 and 100, this car covers x=0 on freeway 1.\n\nNow for future, from t=97 onwards, ΔT=0,1,2,3,...\n\nAt ΔT=0, T=97: for this car, τ + sΔT = -23 + 0 = -23 <=0, h + sΔT = -12 +0 = -12 <=0? 0 <= -12? False, since -12<0. So not covered at T=97.\n\nSimilarly, ΔT=1: -23+6= -17 <=0, -12+6= -6 <=0, 0 <= -6 false.\n\nΔT=2: -23+12= -11 <=0, -12+12=0 <=0 true, covered.\n\nΔT=3: -23+18= -5 <=0, -12+18=6 >=0, 0<=6 true.\n\nΔT=4: -23+24=1 >0, not <=0, so not covered.\n\nSo on freeway 1, unsafe at T=99 and 100 from this car.\n\nOther cars don't cover for ΔT>=0, so freeway 1 is unsafe only at T=99 and 100 for future turns starting from 97.\n\nAt T=97, ΔT=0: let's check all cars on y=1.\n\nCar1: at ΔT=0, span [49,60], 0 not in.\n\nCar2: [13,24], 0 not in.\n\nCar3: [-23,-12], -23 to -12, 0 not in since all negative.\n\nSo safe at T=97.\n\nSimilarly, T=98, ΔT=1: car1 span [49+6,60+6]=[55,66], 0 not in\n\nCar2 [13+6,24+6]=[19,30], 0 not in\n\nCar3 [-23+6,-12+6]=[-17,-6], 0 not in\n\nT=99, ΔT=2: car1 [49+12,60+12]=[61,72], no\n\nCar2 [13+12,24+12]=[25,36], no\n\nCar3 [-23+12,-12+12]=[-11,0], so min=-11, max=0, so 0 <=0 true, covered.\n\nSimilarly T=100, car3 [-23+18,-12+18]=[-5,6], 0 in.\n\nT=101, car3 [-23+24,-12+24]=[1,12], 1>0, not covered.\n\nSo freeway 1 unsafe at T=99 and T=100.\n\nNow freeway y=2.\n\nOnly one car: (h=24, τ=-11, s=36)\n\nRight-moving, span at T: [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] = [-11 + 36ΔT, 24 + 36ΔT]\n\n0 in span if -11 + 36ΔT <= 0 <= 24 + 36ΔT\n\nFirst: -11 + 36ΔT <= 0 => 36ΔT <= 11 => ΔT <= 11/36 ≈ 0.305, so since ΔT integer, ΔT <= 0\n\nSecond: 0 <= 24 + 36ΔT always true for ΔT >=0 since 24+36ΔT >=24>0.\n\n0 <= 24 + 36ΔT is true for all ΔT >=0.\n\nNow first inequality: -11 + 36ΔT <= 0 => 36ΔT <= 11 => ΔT <= 11/36 < 1, so for integer ΔT, ΔT <=0.\n\nFor ΔT=0: -11 +0 = -11 <=0 true, and 0 <=24 true, so covered.\n\nΔT=1: -11 +36=25 >0? -11+36=25, which is >0, so -11+36ΔT <=0 is 25 <=0? False.\n\nSo only at ΔT=0, covered.\n\nThus at T=97, on freeway 2, unsafe.\n\nFor other ΔT, not covered.\n\nSo freeway 2 unsafe only at T=97 for future? But at T=97, we are not on y=2 yet, but if we are on y=2 at turn T.\n\nFor T=97, unsafe.\n\nT=98, ΔT=1: span [-11+36, 24+36]=[25,60], 0 not in.\n\nT=99, [ -11+72, 24+72]= [61,96], no, etc.\n\nSo freeway 2 unsafe only at T=97.\n\nNow freeways 3 to 8 are identical, each with two cars: (-36,-47,right,6) and (12,1,right,6)\n\nFirst car: h=-36, τ=-47, s=6\n\n0 in span: τ + sΔT <= 0 <= h + sΔT\n\n-47 + 6ΔT <= 0 <= -36 + 6ΔT\n\nFirst: -47 + 6ΔT <= 0 => 6ΔT <= 47 => ΔT <= 47/6 ≈ 7.833, so ΔT <= 7\n\nSecond: 0 <= -36 + 6ΔT => 6ΔT >= 36 => ΔT >= 6\n\nSo ΔT >=6 and ΔT <=7\n\nThus for ΔT=6,7\n\nT=97+6=103, T=97+7=104\n\nSecond car: h=12, τ=1, s=6\n\n0 in span: 1 + 6ΔT <= 0 <= 12 + 6ΔT\n\nFirst: 1 + 6ΔT <= 0 => 6ΔT <= -1 => ΔT <= -1/6 ≈ -0.166, so ΔT <= -1\n\nSecond: 0 <= 12 + 6ΔT always true for ΔT >=0\n\nBut ΔT <= -1, and ΔT >=0 impossible, so never for ΔT >=0.\n\nFor example, at ΔT=0, 1+0=1>0, not <=0.\n\nSo only the first car matters for future unsafe times.\n\nThus for each freeway 3 to 8, unsafe at T=103 and 104.\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway, the unsafe turns for future (T>=97):\n\n- y=1: unsafe at T=99,100\n\n- y=2: unsafe only at T=97\n\n- y=3: unsafe at T=103,104\n\n- y=4: same as y=3, unsafe at T=103,104\n\n- y=5: same, T=103,104\n\n- y=6: same, T=103,104\n\n- y=7: same, T=103,104\n\n- y=8: same, T=103,104\n\ny=2 unsafe only at T=97, which is now, but at T=97, we are on y=1, not y=2, so if we go to y=2 later, it is safe except at T=97.\n\nNow, player starts at turn 97, y=1.\n\nAt turn 97, y=1 is safe, as we saw.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nThe minimal moves: from y=1 to y=9, need 8 steps up, but may need to wait or move down to avoid unsafe times.\n\nSince we can only change y by -1,0,+1 each turn, we need a sequence of actions.\n\nLet me denote the turn and y position.\n\nStart: turn 97, y=1\n\nWe need to be at y=9 at some turn.\n\nNow, the constraints:\n\n- When on y=1, must not be at T=99 or 100\n\n- When on y=2, must not be at T=97, but since T=97 is now, and we are not on y=2 now, so for y=2, it is always safe except T=97, which has passed, so for T>97, y=2 is always safe.\n\n- For y=3 to 8, must not be at T=103 or 104\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe always.\n\nNow, to minimize H, the number of turns from start to end.\n\nSince we start at y=1, and need to go to y=9, the direct path would be to go up each turn: actions U,U,U,... but we may hit unsafe times.\n\nSpecifically, if we go up directly:\n\nTurn 97: start y=1, safe\n\nAction U, to y=2 at turn 98\n\nTurn 98: at y=2, which is safe since only unsafe at T=97.\n\nThen action U to y=3 at turn 99\n\nTurn 99: at y=3, but y=3 unsafe only at T=103,104, so at T=99, safe? y=3 unsafe at T=103,104, not at 99.\n\nFreeway y=3 unsafe at T=103,104, so at T=99, it should be safe.\n\nSimilarly, continue.\n\nBut at turn 99, if we are on y=3, but y=1 is unsafe at T=99, but we are not on y=1.\n\nLet's simulate:\n\nTurn 97: y=1, safe (as at T=97)\n\nAction U: y becomes 2 at next turn.\n\nTurn 98: position y=2, since moved at turn 97 to y=2 at turn 98.\n\nAt turn 98, on freeway y=2.\n\ny=2 is safe at T=98, as we saw.\n\nAction U: to y=3 at turn 99.\n\nTurn 99: on y=3.\n\nNow, y=3 unsafe only at T=103,104, so at T=99, safe.\n\nAction U to y=4 at turn 100.\n\nTurn 100: on y=4, safe since unsafe only at T=103,104.\n\nSimilarly, action U to y=5 at turn 101.\n\nTurn 101: on y=5, safe.\n\nU to y=6 at 102.\n\nTurn 102: on y=6, safe.\n\nU to y=7 at 103.\n\nTurn 103: on y=7, but y=7 is unsafe at T=103! Because for y=3 to 8, unsafe at T=103.\n\ny=7 is one of them, so at T=103, on y=7, collision.\n\nProblem.\n\nSimilarly, if we continue U to y=8 at 104, but at T=104, on y=8, unsafe.\n\nSo we need to avoid being on y=3 to 8 at T=103 or 104.\n\nIn the direct path, at turn 103, we are on y=7 if we went up every turn.\n\nTimeline:\n\nStart turn 97: y=1\n\nAfter action at 97: to y=2 at turn 98\n\nTurn 98: y=2, action U to y=3 at turn 99\n\nTurn 99: y=3, action U to y=4 at turn 100\n\nTurn 100: y=4, action U to y=5 at turn 101\n\nTurn 101: y=5, action U to y=6 at turn 102\n\nTurn 102: y=6, action U to y=7 at turn 103\n\nTurn 103: y=7, unsafe\n\nYes.\n\nTo avoid, we need to not be on y=3 to 8 at turns 103 and 104.\n\nSimilarly, for y=1, we have unsafe at 99 and 100, but in this path, we are not on y=1 at those times.\n\nAt turn 99, we are on y=3, which is safe.\n\nTurn 100, on y=4, safe.\n\nOnly problem at 103 and 104.\n\nNow, since we need to reach y=9, and y=9 is safe.\n\nThe unsafe period is only at T=103,104 for y=3-8.\n\nOne way is to delay the movement so that we are not on those y at those times.\n\nFor example, if we stay at lower y longer.\n\nBut we start from y=1.\n\nSince y=2 is always safe after T=97, and y=1 has unsafe at 99,100, so we might want to leave y=1 before 99.\n\nAt turn 97, we are at y=1, safe.\n\nIf we stay at turn 97: action S, then at turn 98, still y=1? Action S: y_{t+1} = y_t +0, so at turn 98, y=1.\n\nBut at turn 98, y=1 is safe, as we saw earlier.\n\nThen at turn 99, if we are still on y=1, it is unsafe.\n\nSo we must not be on y=1 at turn 99 and 100.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 100, unsafe on y=1.\n\nSo we need to be off y=1 by turn 99.\n\nThat is, at turn 99, we should not be on y=1.\n\nSimilarly, not on y=1 at turn 100.\n\nSince we start at turn 97 y=1, we can move up or down at turn 97.\n\nIf we move up at turn 97, to y=2 at turn 98, which is safe.\n\nThen at turn 98, we are on y=2.\n\nFrom there, we can go up.\n\nBut the issue is later with y=3-8 at 103,104.\n\nNow, to handle that, we need to be below y=3 or above y=8 at turns 103 and 104.\n\nBut y=8 is a freeway, unsafe at 103,104, so we need to be y<=2 or y>=9 at T=103,104.\n\ny=0,1,2 or y=9.\n\ny=9 is the goal.\n\nNow, since we need to reach y=9 eventually, and to avoid, we can either stay low until after 104 or go fast to y=9 before 103 if possible, but let's see the timing.\n\nFirst, minimal time to reach y=9 from y=1 is 8 turns: U each turn.\n\nStart turn 97 y=1\n\nAfter 1 U: turn 98 y=2\n\n2 U: turn 99 y=3\n\n3 U: turn 100 y=4\n\n4 U: turn 101 y=5\n\n5 U: turn 102 y=6\n\n6 U: turn 103 y=7\n\n7 U: turn 104 y=8\n\n8 U: turn 105 y=9\n\nAt turn 103, y=7, unsafe\n\nAt turn 104, y=8, unsafe\n\nAnd we reach y=9 at turn 105.\n\nBut collisions at 103 and 104.\n\nWe need to avoid that.\n\nOne option: go slower, stay at safe positions.\n\nFor example, at turn 103 and 104, be at y<=2 or y=9.\n\ny=9 is the target.\n\nSince we start at y=1, we can go down to y=0 and stay, but y=0 is safe, but we need to go up eventually.\n\nBut going down might waste turns.\n\nTo reach y=9 faster, better to go up but avoid the unsafe times.\n\nAnother idea: since the unsafe turns are 103 and 104, we can be at y=2 at those times, for example.\n\ny=2 is always safe after T=97.\n\nSimilarly, y=1 is safe except 99 and 100, so after 100, y=1 is safe.\n\ny=1 unsafe only at 99 and 100, so at T=101 and later, y=1 is safe if no other cars, but for y=1, we have cars, but from earlier, for ΔT>=4, no cars cover 0, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=2 safe always after 97.\n\nNow, back to the plan.\n\nWe need to be at y<=2 or y=9 at T=103 and 104.\n\nBut y=9 might not be reachable by 103 with minimal moves.\n\nFrom start, to reach y=9 in H turns.\n\nAt turn t, y_t.\n\nStart t=97, y=1\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t=97+H, y=9? The position after H actions.\n\nAfter t actions from start, at turn 97+t, y position.\n\nWe reach y=9 at some turn T, and T-97 is the number of turns taken.\n\nBut we need the sequence.\n\nSince the only hazards are:\n\n- Must leave y=1 by turn 98, so not on y=1 at 99 or 100. Since at turn 98, if we are at y=1, then at turn 99 we are still on y=1 if we stay, but we can move.\n\nAt turn T, position y_T.\n\nFor T=99 and 100, y_T should not be 1.\n\nSimilarly, for T=103 and 104, y_T should not be in {3,4,5,6,7,8}.\n\nNow, y_T is the position at turn T.\n\nWe start at T=97, y=1.\n\nWe can choose actions.\n\nTo minimize H, we want to go up fast, but avoid being at forbidden positions at forbidden times.\n\nOne way is to go up directly but pause or something.\n\nSince y=2 is safe, we can go to y=2 quickly and stay there during 103-104.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9.\n\nLet's list the turns from 97 onwards.\n\nTurn | y before action | action | y after action (which is position at next turn)\n\nAt turn t, we are at position y_t, then choose action a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, with Δy based on a_t.\n\nAnd at turn t, we are on y_t, so must be safe for y_t at time t.\n\nFor t=97: y=1, safe, as established.\n\nWe need to choose a_{97}, which determines y_{98}.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, constraints:\n\n- For t=99: y_{99} != 1\n\n- For t=100: y_{100} != 1\n\n- For t=103: y_{103} not in {3,4,5,6,7,8}\n\n- For t=104: y_{104} not in {3,4,5,6,7,8}\n\nAlso, y must be between 0 and 9.\n\nTo reach y=9 asap.\n\nThe direct path has H=8 to reach y=9 at turn 105, but with collisions at 103 and 104.\n\nWe need to add delay or change path.\n\nSince we have to avoid y=1 at t=99,100, which is easy: just move up from y=1 by t=99.\n\nAt t=97, we can go U or S or D.\n\nIf we go U at t=97, then y_{98} = y_{97} +1 = 2\n\nThen at t=98, y=2\n\nThen we can go U to y=3 at t=99, etc.\n\nBut then we hit y=7 at t=103.\n\nTo avoid being at y=3-8 at t=103,104, we can be at y=2 at those times.\n\nFor example, if we are at y=2 at t=103 and t=104.\n\nThen after that, go up to y=9.\n\nBut we need to reach y=2 early and stay or something.\n\nStart: t=97, y=1\n\nAction U: to y=2 at t=98\n\nt=98, y=2, now we need to be at y=2 at t=103 and 104? But we can go up slowly.\n\nFrom t=98, y=2, if we stay at y=2 until after t=104, but that would take many turns, not minimal.\n\nWe can go up to some point, then come down to y=2 for t=103,104, but that wastes turns.\n\nBetter to go up after t=104.\n\nBut let's see how fast we can go.\n\nFirst, we must leave y=1 by t=98? Not necessarily.\n\nAt t=97, if we do S, then y_{98}=1, then at t=98, y=1, which is safe (t=98 safe for y=1), but then at t=99, if we are still y=1, unsafe, so we must move at t=98 to not be at y=1 at t=99.\n\nSo at t=98, we must not end up with y_{99}=1, so from y_{98}, if we do S, y_{99}=y_{98}, so if y_{98}=1, y_{99}=1, bad. If we do U or D, y changes.\n\nSimilarly for t=100.\n\nBut since t=99 and t=100 both must not have y=1, we need to ensure that by t=99, we are not at y=1, and similarly for t=100.\n\nEasily, we can go to y=2 by t=98 or earlier.\n\nNow for the later part.\n\nThe critical turns are 103 and 104.\n\nWe need to be at y<=2 or y=9 at those turns.\n\ny=9 is better, but can we reach y=9 by t=103?\n\nFrom start t=97 y=1, to y=9 at turn T.\n\nMinimal T: with all U, we reach y=9 at turn 105, as above.\n\nt=97: y=1\n\nt=98: y=2\n\n...\n\nt=105: y=9\n\nSo at t=103, y=7, t=104 y=8, not 9.\n\nTo reach y=9 by t=103, we need to be at y=9 at turn 103.\n\nThat means from y=1 at t=97 to y=9 at t=103, in 6 turns? From t=97 to t=103 is 6 turns later.\n\nAt turn 97, before action, y=1.\n\nAfter 1st action (t=97), y at t=98\n\nAfter 2nd action (t=98), y at t=99\n\n...\n\nAfter k actions, y at t=97+k\n\nSet t=97+k =103, so k=6, y at t=103 = y after 6 actions.\n\nStart y=1, after 6 actions, to reach y=9, need +8 in y, but each action at most +1, so maximum y after 6 actions is 1+6=7, so y=7 at t=103, cannot be y=9.\n\nSimilarly, at t=104, after 7 actions, max y=1+7=8, not 9.\n\nAt t=105, after 8 actions, y=9 possible.\n\nSo we cannot reach y=9 before t=105.\n\nTherefore, at t=103 and t=104, we cannot be at y=9; the best we can be is y=8 at t=104, but y=8 is unsafe at t=104.\n\ny=7 at t=103 unsafe.\n\nSo we must be at y<=2 at t=103 and t=104.\n\nSince y=0,1,2 are safe at those times.\n\ny=1 and y=2 are safe after t=100, as unsafe only at 99,100.\n\nFor t=103,104, y=1 and y=2 are safe.\n\ny=0 always safe.\n\nNow, to minimize time, we can go up to y=2 quickly and stay there until after t=104, then go up to y=9.\n\nBut staying will add turns.\n\nWe can go up slowly, but let's find the minimal H.\n\nSince we need to be at y<=2 at t=103 and 104, and reach y=9 later.\n\nThe earliest we can be at y=9 is t=105, as before.\n\nBut at t=105, we can reach y=9.\n\nNow, from start to t=103, we have from t=97 to t=103, 7 turns (t=97,98,99,100,101,102,103), but positions.\n\nAt t=97: y=1\n\nWe need at t=103: y<=2\n\nSimilarly at t=104: y<=2\n\nThen from there, go up to y=9.\n\nTo reach y=9 fast, we want to be as high as possible when we start going up, but constrained to be low at t=103.\n\nt=103 is turn 103.\n\nNow, let's list the sequence.\n\nFirst, handle the early constraint: avoid y=1 at t=99 and t=100.\n\nSo at t=99, y !=1, at t=100, y!=1.\n\nSince at t=97, y=1, we can:\n\n- At t=97, action U: then y_{98}=2\n\nThen at t=98, y=2\n\nNow at t=98, we can choose action.\n\ny at t=99: if we do S, y_{99}=2, not 1, good.\n\nIf U, y_{99}=3, etc.\n\nSimilarly, at t=100, as long as not 1.\n\nBut we also need to be low at t=103.\n\nt=103 is later.\n\nNow, the turns from t=97 to t=103: 7 turns, from y=1 to y<=2.\n\nThe net change in y is small, so we may need to move down or stay to not go too high.\n\nMinimal actions to be at y<=2 at t=103 with start y=1.\n\nWe need the position at t=103 to be <=2.\n\nThe sum of Δy from t=97 to t=102 determines y_{103}, since y_{103} = y_{102} + Δy_{102}, but y_{103} is after action at t=102.\n\ny_t is position at turn t.\n\ny_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\n\nSo y_{103} = y_{102} + Δy_{102}\n\nBut y_{102} depends on previous.\n\nFrom y_{97} =1\n\ny_{103} <=2\n\nThe actions from t=97 to t=102 inclusive affect y_{103}, since y_{103} = y_{97} + sum_{i=97}^{102} Δy_i\n\ny_{103} = y_{97} + Δy_{97} + Δy_{98} + ... + Δy_{102}\n\nBecause y_{98} = y_{97} + Δy_{97}\n\ny_{99} = y_{98} + Δy_{98} = y_{97} + Δy_{97} + Δy_{98}\n\n...\n\ny_{103} = y_{97} + Δy_{97} + Δy_{98} + Δy_{99} + Δy_{100} + Δy_{101} + Δy_{102}\n\nYes, 6 terms? From t=97 to t=102 is 6 actions: i=97 to 102.\n\nt=97 to t=102 inclusive: 6 turns, but actions at t=97 to t=102 affect y_{103}.\n\nNumber of actions from t=97 to t=102: 6 actions (t=97,98,99,100,101,102), which set y_{103}.\n\ny_{103} = y_{97} + sum_{k=0}^{5} Δy_{97+k} = 1 + sum of 6 Δy\n\nEach Δy in {-1,0,1}\n\ny_{103} <=2, so 1 + sum_{i=1}^6 Δy_i <=2, so sum Δy from 97 to 102 <=1\n\nSimilarly, we need y_{104} <=2, but y_{104} = y_{103} + Δy_{103}\n\nFirst, let's focus on y_{103} <=2.\n\nSimilarly, for y_{104} <=2, but since we can choose action at t=103, we can keep it low.\n\nBut also, we need to reach y=9 later.\n\nNow, back to early turns.\n\nWe need to not be at y=1 at t=99 and t=100.\n\ny_{99} !=1, y_{100} !=1.\n\ny_{99} = y_{97} + Δy_{97} + Δy_{98}\n\ny_{100} = y_{97} + Δy_{97} + Δy_{98} + Δy_{99}\n\ny_{97} =1\n\nSo y_{99} = 1 + Δy_{97} + Δy_{98} !=1, so Δy_{97} + Δy_{98} !=0\n\nSimilarly, y_{100} =1 + Δy_{97} + Δy_{98} + Δy_{99} !=1, so Δy_{97} + Δy_{98} + Δy_{99} !=0\n\nNow, for minimal time, we want to go up as much as possible, but with constraints.\n\nSince we need to be low at t=103, we can go up slowly or even go down.\n\nBut going down might not be efficient.\n\nLet's think of a plan where we are at y=2 at t=103 and t=104.\n\nThen after t=104, we can go up to y=9.\n\nFrom y=2 to y=9, need 7 Up moves, so 7 turns.\n\nIf we are at y=2 at t=104, then at t=105 y=3, t=106 y=4, ..., t=111 y=9, so at turn 111, y=9.\n\nBut we can be higher at t=104 if possible, but we need y<=2 at t=104.\n\nt=104 y<=2.\n\nNow, what is the earliest we can be at y=2 or less at t=103.\n\nBut we start at y=1, we can be at y=2 early.\n\nBut we need to stay around.\n\nTo minimize total turns, we should not stay unnecessarily; only stay to waste time until after unsafe period.\n\nThe unsafe period for high y is only at t=103,104, so we need to be low at those exact turns.\n\nBefore that, we can be higher, but we have to come down or something, which costs extra actions.\n\nFor example, if we go up to y=8 before t=103, then come down to y=2 for t=103, that would take many down actions, inefficient.\n\nBetter to not go high before t=103.\n\nSo, from start, go up slowly to y=2 and stay there until t=104, then go up.\n\nBut we have the early constraint for y=1.\n\nStart at t=97 y=1\n\nTo avoid being at y=1 at t=99,100, we can move up at t=97.\n\nAction at t=97: U, then y_{98}=2\n\nNow at t=98, y=2\n\nWe can stay at y=2 for several turns.\n\ny=2 is safe at all times except t=97, but t=97 passed.\n\nNow, we need to be at y<=2 at t=103 and t=104.\n\nSince we are at y=2 at t=98, we can stay there by doing S actions.\n\nThen at t=103, y=2, t=104 y=2, both safe.\n\nThen at t=104, we can start going up.\n\nAction at t=104: U, to y=3 at t=105\n\nBut at t=105, we are on y=3, which is safe now since unsafe only at 103,104 passed.\n\nSimilarly, we can go up each turn to y=9 at t=112.\n\nt=104: y=2 (position at turn 104)\n\nAfter action at t=104: U, y_{105}=3\n\nt=105: y=3, action U, y_{106}=4\n\nt=106: y=4, U, y_{107}=5\n\nt=107: y=5, U, y_{108}=6\n\nt=108: y=6, U, y_{109}=7\n\nt=109: y=7, U, y_{110}=8\n\nt=110: y=8, U, y_{111}=9\n\nSo reach y=9 at turn 111.\n\nH = number of actions from t=97 to t=110, so 14 actions? Let's see turns.\n\nStart turn t=97, after H actions, at turn t=97+H, we have y=9.\n\nIn this case, at turn 111, y=9, so t=97+H=111, H=14.\n\nBut we can do better.\n\nWe don't need to stay at y=2 from t=98 to t=104; we can go up a bit, as long as we come back to y<=2 at t=103.\n\nFor example, from t=98, y=2, we can go up to y=3, then y=4, but then we need to come down to y=2 by t=103.\n\nBut coming down costs extra actions.\n\nFor instance, suppose at t=98, y=2, we do U, to y=3 at t=99\n\nt=99: y=3, safe\n\nWe can do U to y=4 at t=100\n\nt=100: y=4, safe\n\nThen we need to be y<=2 at t=103.\n\nAt t=100, y=4\n\ny_{103} = y_{100} + Δy_{100} + Δy_{101} + Δy_{102}\n\ny_{103} <=2, y_{100}=4, so 4 + sum Δy <=2, so sum Δy from t=100 to t=102 <= -2\n\nSo we need at least two down actions between t=100,101,102.\n\nFor example, at t=100, action D, y_{101}=3\n\nt=101, action D, y_{102}=2\n\nt=102, action S, y_{103}=2\n\nThen at t=103, y=2 <=2, safe.\n\nThen at t=103, we need to stay or go down to keep y<=2 for t=104.\n\ny_{104} = y_{103} + Δy_{103} <=2\n\nSince y_{103}=2, so Δy_{103} <=0, so S or D.\n\nIf S, y_{104}=2, good.\n\nThen at t=104, y=2, now we can go up.\n\nBut at t=104, we are on y=2, safe.\n\nThen action at t=104: U to y=3 at t=105\n\nThen U each to y=9 at t=111 as before.\n\nBut we reached y=2 at t=102, earlier than before.\n\nt=102 y=2, then t=103 y=2, t=104 y=2, then t=105 y=3, ..., t=111 y=9.\n\nSame as before.\n\nIn this case, from t=98 to t=100 we went up to y=4, then down to y=2, so we wasted some actions going up and down.\n\nIn terms of time to reach y=9, it's the same or worse.\n\nIf we stay at y=2 from beginning, we reach y=9 later.\n\nBut we can go up to y=2 and stay, but we need to handle the early part.\n\nAnother idea: since y=1 is safe after t=100, we can stay at y=1 until t=100, but we cannot because at t=99 and t=100, y=1 is unsafe.\n\nAt t=97, y=1, if we do S, y_{98}=1\n\nThen at t=98, y=1, safe, but we must not be at y=1 at t=99, so at t=98, we must do action to change y, so U or D.\n\nIf U, y_{99}=2\n\nOr D, y_{99}=0\n\nThen at t=99, if y=2 or 0, not 1, good.\n\nSimilarly for t=100.\n\nBut if we go down to y=0, it might take longer to go up.\n\nNot efficient.\n\nSo best to go up to y=2 quickly.\n\nAt t=97: action U, to y=2 at t=98\n\nThen at t=98: we can choose to stay or go up.\n\nIf we go up, we might go too high and need to come down for t=103.\n\nBut coming down costs.\n\nIf we stay at y=2 from t=98 to t=102, for example, then at t=103 y=2, etc.\n\nBut let's count the turns.\n\nFrom start, to be at y=2 at t=103 with minimal actions, but since we start at y=1, we can be at y=2 with one up, but then stay.\n\nThe number of actions to reach y=9 depends on when we start going up.\n\nDefine the turn when we leave y<=2 to go up.\n\nSuppose we stay at y=2 until turn T_s, then from there go up to y=9 in 7 turns.\n\nReach y=9 at turn T_s + 7.\n\nT_s must be at least 104 or later, so that at t=103 and 104, we are at y=2.\n\nAt t=104, we are at y=2, so T_s >=104.\n\nIf at t=104 we are at y=2, then we can start going up from there.\n\nAction at t=104: U, to y=3 at t=105, etc., to y=9 at t=111.\n\nT_s =104, reach y=9 at 111.\n\nCan we start earlier? But at t=103, we need to be at y<=2, so at t=104, if we are at y<=2, we can start.\n\nBut to start going up at turn T, we need to be at some y<9 at turn T.\n\nThe earliest T to start going up is 104, at y=2, reach y=9 at 111.\n\nBut at t=103, if we are at y=2, and at t=104 we go U to y=3, but at t=104 we are on y=3? Position at turn t=104 is before action.\n\nAt turn t=104, position y_{104}, then we choose action a_{104}, which determines y_{105}.\n\nTo reach y=9 at turn T, with T as small as possible.\n\nIf we are at y=2 at t=104, then after actions: at t=105 y=3, t=106 y=4, ..., t=111 y=9.\n\nSo T=111.\n\nBut we can be at a higher y at t=104, but we need y_{104} <=2, so cannot be higher.\n\nUnless we are at y=9 earlier, but we can't before t=105.\n\nAnother way: perhaps we can be at y=2 at t=103, and at t=103 we go up, but y_{104} = y_{103} + Δy_{103}\n\nIf at t=103, y=2, and we do U, then y_{104}=3\n\nBut at t=104, we are on y=3, which is unsafe because t=104, y=3 in {3,4,5,6,7,8}, collision.\n\nSo we cannot be on y=3 to 8 at t=104.\n\nTherefore, at t=104, we must be at y<=2 or y=9.\n\nBut y=9 impossible at t=104, so must be y<=2.\n\nSimilarly at t=103, must be y<=2.\n\nSo at both t=103 and t=104, y<=2.\n\nThen at t=104, we are at y<=2, say y=2, then we can go up to y=3 at t=105, but at t=105, we are on y=3, safe, and so on.\n\nReach y=9 at t=111 as above.\n\nBut can we reduce this?\n\nSuppose at t=104, we are at y=2, but if we were at a higher y earlier, we could have saved time, but we had to come down.\n\nFor example, suppose by t=102, we are at y=8, then we need to be y<=2 at t=103, so at t=102, action D, y_{103}=7, but y=7 at t=103 unsafe, not good.\n\ny_{103} must be <=2.\n\nIf at t=102, y=8, to have y_{103} <=2, we need Δy_{102} <= -6, impossible since |Δy|<=1.\n\nSo we cannot be high at t=102; we must be low already.\n\nThe position at t=102 must be such that y_{103} = y_{102} + Δy_{102} <=2, so y_{102} <=3, since if y_{102}=3, we can do D to y_{103}=2; if y_{102}=2, S or D to y_{103}<=2; etc.\n\nSimilarly, for y_{104} <=2.\n\nBut also, we have the early constraints.\n\nTo minimize time, we should be as high as possible at t=102, but y_{102} <=3, so that we can go down to y=2 at t=103.\n\nFor example, at t=102, y=3, then action D at t=102, y_{103}=2\n\nThen at t=103, y=2, safe.\n\nThen at t=103, we need to keep y_{104} <=2, so action S or D, say S, y_{104}=2\n\nThen at t=104, y=2, safe.\n\nThen go up from there.\n\nNow, we need to reach y=3 at t=102.\n\nFrom start, y=1 at t=97.\n\ny_{102} = y_{97} + Δy_{97} + Δy_{98} + Δy_{99} + Δy_{100} + Δy_{101}\n\ny_{102} = 1 + sum_{i=97}^{101} Δy_i\n\nWe want y_{102} =3, for example.\n\nSo 1 + sum of 5 Δy =3, so sum Δy from t=97 to t=101 =2\n\nThat means net +2 in 5 actions, so possible with e.g., three U, two S; or two U, three S, etc., but to be high, more U.\n\nAlso, we have constraints at t=99 and t=100.\n\ny_{99} !=1, y_{100} !=1.\n\ny_{99} =1 + Δy_{97} + Δy_{98} !=1, so Δy_{97} + Δy_{98} !=0\n\ny_{100} =1 + Δy_{97} + Δy_{98} + Δy_{99} !=1, so Δy_{97} + Δy_{98} + Δy_{99} !=0\n\nNow, to have sum_{97 to 101} Δy =2\n\nAnd y_{102} =3\n\nThen at t=102, action D, y_{103}=2\n\nThen at t=103, action S, y_{104}=2\n\nThen at t=104, action U, y_{105}=3\n\nThen U each: t=105 y=3, t=106 y=4, ..., t=111 y=9? t=105 y=3, t=106 y=4, t=107 y=5, t=108 y=6, t=109 y=7, t=110 y=8, t=111 y=9.\n\nSame as before.\n\nBut we reached y=3 at t=102, which is higher, but we had to do a down action at t=102 to go to y=2 for t=103.\n\nSo net, we used an extra down action, so the position at t=104 is still y=2, same as if we stayed at y=2.\n\nNo gain.\n\nIf we can reach y=3 at t=102 without extra cost, but from y=1 to y=3 in 5 actions (from t=97 to t=101 actions set y_{102}).\n\ny_{102} = y after actions at t=97 to t=101.\n\nActions at t=97,98,99,100,101 affect y_{102}.\n\n5 actions.\n\nStart y=1, after 5 actions, to y=3, net +2, so possible with e.g., U,U,S,S,S or other, but with constraints.\n\nBut in the stay-low strategy, we were at y=2 at t=102 with fewer up actions, but we stayed.\n\nIn terms of time to y=9, it's the same.\n\nThe minimal H is 14, reaching y=9 at turn 111.\n\nBut let's confirm if we can reach earlier.\n\nSuppose we go up directly but at some point stay or move to avoid the unsafe turns.\n\nFor example, at t=102, in direct path, y=6, action U to y=7 at t=103, but unsafe.\n\nInstead, at t=102, y=6, we can do S, so y_{103}=6, but y=6 at t=103 unsafe.\n\nOr do D, y_{103}=5, still unsafe since y=5 in 3-8.\n\nOr do nothing, still on y=6 at t=103 unsafe.\n\nSo we must not be on y=3-8 at t=103.\n\nSimilarly at t=102, if we are on y=3-8, we need to be off or low, but we can't to y<=2 in one step from y=6.\n\nSo the only way is to be low before t=103.\n\nTherefore, the minimal way is to be at y=2 at t=103 and t=104, then go up.\n\nNow, to have y=2 at t=103, we can arrive earlier and stay.\n\nWith the early constraint, we go to y=2 at t=98.\n\nThen stay there from t=98 to t=104.\n\nAt t=98, y=2\n\nAction S at t=98, y_{99}=2\n\nt=99, action S, y_{100}=2\n\nt=100, action S, y_{101}=2\n\nt=101, action S, y_{102}=2\n\nt=102, action S, y_{103}=2\n\nt=103, action S, y_{104}=2\n\nThen t=104, action U, y_{105}=3\n\nt=105, U, y_{106}=4\n\nt=106, U, y_{107}=5\n\nt=107, U, y_{108}=6\n\nt=108, U, y_{109}=7\n\nt=109, U, y_{110}=8\n\nt=110, U, y_{111}=9\n\nReach at turn 111.\n\nBut at t=99 and t=100, we are at y=2, not 1, so safe.\n\nAnd at t=103,104, y=2, safe.\n\nNow, can we reduce the number of stay actions?\n\nFor example, if we can be at y=2 at t=103 without staying all the time.\n\nBut from start, to be at y=2 at t=103 with fewer actions, but we need to be there at that time, not earlier.\n\nSince we have to be low at t=103,104, and we start low, staying is fine.\n\nBut we can go up to y=3 or something and come down, but that would require more actions, not fewer.\n\nFor example, suppose at t=98, y=2, we go U to y=3 at t=99\n\nThen at t=99, y=3, safe\n\nThen we can go U to y=4 at t=100\n\nt=100, y=4, safe\n\nThen we need to be y<=2 at t=103.\n\nAt t=100, y=4\n\ny_{103} = y_{100} + Δy_{100} + Δy_{101} + Δy_{102} <=2\n\nSince y_{100}=4, so Δy_{100} + Δy_{101} + Δy_{102} <= -2\n\nSo we need at least two down actions in t=100,101,102.\n\nSay, at t=100, action D, y_{101}=3\n\nt=101, action D, y_{102}=2\n\nt=102, action S, y_{103}=2\n\nThen at t=103, action S, y_{104}=2\n\nThen go up as before.\n\nBut we used two down actions, whereas in the stay case, we used no down actions, so we saved no time; in fact, we used extra actions to go up and down.\n\nIn this case, from t=98 to t=100, we went to y=4, then down to y=2, so net from t=98 to t=102, we have y=2, same as staying, but we used more actions to move.\n\nNo benefit.\n\nTherefore, the most efficient is to go to y=2 quickly and stay until after t=104.\n\nNow, with the early constraint, we go to y=2 at t=98.\n\nThen stay from t=98 to t=104, at y=2.\n\nAt t=104, go up.\n\nNow, the sequence of actions.\n\nStart at t=97, y=1\n\nAction at t=97: U, so a_{97} = U\n\nThen y_{98} = 1 +1 =2\n\nTurn t=98: position y=2\n\nAction at t=98: S, to stay at y=2 for t=99\n\nSimilarly, t=99: action S, y_{100}=2\n\nt=100: action S, y_{101}=2\n\nt=101: action S, y_{102}=2\n\nt=102: action S, y_{103}=2\n\nt=103: action S, y_{104}=2\n\nNow at turn t=104, position y=2\n\nAction at t=104: U, so y_{105} = 2+1=3\n\nt=105: y=3, action U, y_{106}=4\n\nt=106: y=4, action U, y_{107}=5\n\nt=107: y=5, action U, y_{108}=6\n\nt=108: y=6, action U, y_{109}=7\n\nt=109: y=7, action U, y_{110}=8\n\nt=110: y=8, action U, y_{111}=9\n\nSo at turn 111, y=9.\n\nH is the number of actions to reach, so from t=97 to t=110, 14 actions, reach at turn 111.\n\nBut H is the number of turns, I think from start to the turn before reaching, but the sequence includes actions from t=97 to t=110, and after H actions, at turn t=97+H, y=9.\n\nHere t=97 to t=110 is 14 turns? t=97,98,...,110 is 14 turns, but after 14 actions, at turn 111, y=9.\n\nYes.\n\nBut can we start going up earlier?\n\nAt t=104, we are at y=2, but if we can be at y=2 at t=104 with fewer stays, but we need to be there at that time.\n\nSince we have to be low at t=103 and 104, and t=104 is when we start going up, but we can't start before because if we go up earlier, we might be high at t=103 or 104.\n\nUnless we go up to y=9 before, but impossible.\n\nAnother idea: go down to y=0 and stay, but that would take longer to go up.\n\nWorse.\n\nPerhaps for freeways 3-8, the unsafe times are t=103,104, but if we can be on a different y at that time.\n\nBut we have to be on y<=2.\n\nI think 14 is minimal.\n\nBut let's check if we can reach in less than 14 actions.\n\nSuppose we are at y=2 at t=103, but we start going up at t=103.\n\nAt t=103, if y=2, action U, y_{104}=3\n\nBut at t=104, we are on y=3, which is unsafe, collision.\n\nSo we cannot do that.\n\nMust be at y<=2 at t=104.\n\nSo the earliest to start going up is t=104 from y<=2.\n\nThen 7 up moves to y=9 at t=111.\n\nFrom start to t=104, we need to be at y<=2.\n\nWith start at y=1 t=97, to y=2 at t=98, then stay to t=104, that's 7 actions to stay? From t=98 to t=103, we do S actions to keep y=2.\n\nActions at t=97 to t=103: t=97 U, t=98 S, t=99 S, t=100 S, t=101 S, t=102 S, t=103 S, then at t=104, y=2, then U at t=104 to t=110 U.\n\nSequence:\n\nt=97: U  // to y=2 at t=98\n\nt=98: S  // y=2 at t=99\n\nt=99: S  // y=2 at t=100\n\nt=100: S  // y=2 at t=101\n\nt=101: S  // y=2 at t=102\n\nt=102: S  // y=2 at t=103\n\nt=103: S  // y=2 at t=104\n\nt=104: U  // y=3 at t=105\n\nt=105: U  // y=4 at t=106\n\nt=106: U  // y=5 at t=107\n\nt=107: U  // y=6 at t=108\n\nt=108: U  // y=7 at t=109\n\nt=109: U  // y=8 at t=110\n\nt=110: U  // y=9 at t=111\n\nNow, H=14 actions, from t=97 to t=110.\n\nBut in the sequence, we have actions from t=97 to t=110.\n\nThe player reaches (0,9) at turn t=111.\n\nBut the minimal number of turns H should be the number of actions taken until reaching, but in the sequence, we need to specify actions until we reach.\n\nIn the answer, we need the sequence until the last action before reaching.\n\nAfter action at t=110, we reach y=9 at t=111.\n\nSo actions from t=97 to t=110.\n\nNow, but we have 14 actions.\n\nBut let's see if we can reduce by one.\n\nSuppose at t=103, instead of S, we do nothing, but S is stay.\n\nIf we can be at y=2 at t=104 with one less action.\n\nBut from start, to be at y=2 at t=104.\n\ny_{104} = y_{97} + sum_{i=97}^{103} Δy_i = 1 + sum of 7 Δy\n\nSet to 2, so sum Δy =1.\n\nWith constraints.\n\nFor example, we can have more U actions earlier, but then we might be higher and need to come down, but coming down requires D actions, which decrease y, so to have sum Δy=1, if we go up and down, it might not help.\n\nFor instance, at t=97 U, y_{98}=2\n\nt=98 U, y_{99}=3\n\nt=99 S, y_{100}=3? But at t=99, y=3, but we need y_{99} !=1, which is true, and y_{100} !=1, true.\n\nBut y_{100}=3\n\nThen we need to come down for t=103.\n\ny_{104} must be <=2.\n\nBut y_{104} = y_{100} + Δy_{100} + Δy_{101} + Δy_{102} + Δy_{103} =3 + sum of 4 Δy <=2, so sum <= -1, so need at least one down.\n\nBut also y_{103} <=2.\n\ny_{103} = y_{100} + Δy_{100} + Δy_{101} + Δy_{102} =3 + sum of 3 Δy <=2, so sum <= -1, need at least one down in t=100,101,102.\n\nThen for y_{104} <=2, similar.\n\nBut we end up with more actions or same.\n\nI think 14 is the minimal.\n\nBut in the sequence above, at t=99 and t=100, we are at y=3 and y=3 or something, which is fine, but we still need to come down, so no gain.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 14, with the sequence as above.\n\nBut in the sequence, we have actions from t=97 to t=110.\n\nNow, to write the answer.\n\nFirst, current turn t_1=97.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 97: U\n\nTurn 98: S\n\nTurn 99: S\n\nTurn 100: S\n\nTurn 101: S\n\nTurn 102: S\n\nTurn 103: S\n\nTurn 104: U\n\nTurn 105: U\n\nTurn 106: U\n\nTurn 107: U\n\nTurn 108: U\n\nTurn 109: U\n\nTurn 110: U\n\nAfter action at t=110, y=9 at t=111.\n\nBut the sequence should be until we reach, I think.\n\nIn the answer format, it says {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}, so for t from 0 to H-1.\n\nt_1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nHere t_1=97, so actions a_{97} to a_{97 + H-1}\n\nAfter H actions, we reach at turn t_1 + H.\n\nIn this case, after 14 actions, from t=97 to t=110 (t=97 + 13? Let's index.\n\nSet t_1 =97.\n\nThen actions a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t_1 + H, position should be (0,9).\n\nHere, at turn 97 + H, y=9.\n\nIn our case, at turn 111, y=9, so 97 + H =111, H=14.\n\nActions: for t=0 to 13: a_{97+0} to a_{97+13} = a_{97} to a_{110}\n\nAs above.\n\nNow, but we can check if for freeway y=8 or others, but I think it's fine.\n\nPerhaps we can start going up at t=104 from y=2, but if we can be at y=1 at some point, but y=1 is safe after t=100.\n\nFor example, after t=100, we can go to y=1, but since we need to go up, not useful.\n\nIn the sequence above, we stay at y=2 from t=98 to t=104, which is fine.\n\nTo save one turn, but I don't think so.\n\nAnother thought: at t=103, if we do D to y=1 at t=104, but y=1 is safe at t=104, then from y=1 go up, but it takes more moves to reach y=9.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo I think H=14 is minimal.\n\nBut let's confirm the car on freeway 2.\n\nFreeway y=2 has only unsafe at t=97, which is past, so for t>97, always safe, as we have.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nIn the sequence, at t=98 to t=104, we are at y=2, which is safe.\n\nThen from t=105 to t=110, we are on y=3 to y=8, but at those times, only unsafe at t=103,104 for y=3-8, but t=105>104, so safe.\n\nFor example, y=3 at t=105: unsafe only at t=103,104, so safe.\n\nSimilarly all.\n\nAnd we reach y=9 at t=111.\n\nNow, the answer should be the sequence.\n\nBut in the sequence, from t=97 to t=103, except t=97 U, all S until t=103, then U from t=104 to t=110.\n\nt=97: U\n\nt=98 to t=103: S (6 times)\n\nt=104 to t=110: U (7 times)\n\nt=104 U, t=105 U, ..., t=110 U, that's 7 U.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, for the box.\n\nBut the initial position is (0,1), and we need to reach (0,9).\n\nAlso, for freeway y=1, we avoided being there at t=99,100.\n\nIn this sequence, at t=99, we are at y=2, not 1.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nI think it's correct.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 1)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 97\\) is 14, with the sequence of actions starting from turn 97 and ending at turn 110.
