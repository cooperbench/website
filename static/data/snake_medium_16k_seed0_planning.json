        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 0, and the grid is 8x8 because the walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think? Let me confirm the coordinates.\n\nThe walls are defined as border cells: x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7, so the grid is from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7, but the walls are at the borders, so cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Therefore, the snake can only be on cells where 1 ≤ x ≤ 6 and 1 ≤ y ≤ 6? Not necessarily, because the snake positions are given as (3,3), which should be within bounds.\n\nSnake positions: [(3,3)] – that's just the head, so the snake is only one cell long at this point. Since it's the starting position, and head direction is L (left).\n\nFood positions:\n\n- (3,5) with value 1, life span 10\n\n- (2,2) with value 1, life span 10\n\n- (4,3) with value 1, life span 10\n\nAll food is positive since value is +1.\n\nInternal obstacles: [(5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3)]\n\nSo, cells that are blocked: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3)\n\nNow, since the snake is only one cell, there's no body to worry about, and tail collision isn't an issue yet. Also, because it's just the head, moving onto a food cell should be fine, as long as it doesn't cause immediate collision.\n\nHead direction is L, which is left, so current facing direction is left.\n\nMovement constraints: I can move U, D, L, R, but no instant reverse. Since current direction is L, reverse would be R (right), so I cannot move right on the next turn. But since this is turn 0, and I'm choosing the action for turn 0, I need to choose a direction.\n\nThe answer should include actions for multiple turns. Think 5+ turns ahead, so I need to plan a sequence of actions for turns 0,1,2,3,4,5, etc.\n\nBut I have to output for each turn starting from t1=0.\n\nAlso, food life span decreases each turn, so I need to consider that.\n\nFirst, let's map out the grid.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls at borders, so invalid cells: all where x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.\n\nPlayable area: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? x=1,2,3,4,5,6 and y=1,2,3,4,5,6.\n\nBut there are internal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3)\n\nAnd food at: (3,5), (2,2), (4,3)\n\nSnake at (3,3)\n\nCurrent head direction: L, so facing left.\n\nPossible moves from (3,3):\n\n- Up (U): to (3,4)\n\n- Down (D): to (3,2)\n\n- Left (L): to (2,3)\n\n- Right (R): to (4,3)\n\nBut right is reverse direction? Current direction is L, so reverse is R. No instant reverse means I cannot move opposite to current direction on the next turn. Since I'm choosing action for turn 0, and current direction is given, I think I can choose any direction except the reverse if it were the next turn, but for the first move, I can choose any.\n\nThe rule: \"Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\" But \"next turn\" refers to the turn after the current one? Let me read carefully.\n\n\"**No instant reverse**: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\"\n\nIt says \"on next turn\", meaning when executing the action for turn t, I cannot choose the opposite of the current direction for that action.\n\nFor example, at turn t, with current direction D, I cannot choose U for turn t action.\n\nSimilarly here, current direction L, so for turn 0 action, I cannot choose R, because R is opposite to L.\n\nOpposite directions: U and D are opposites, L and R are opposites.\n\nSo current direction L, so I cannot move R for turn 0.\n\nTherefore, possible actions for turn 0: U, D, or L.\n\nNow, let's see what each move leads to.\n\nFirst, move U to (3,4): is this cell free? Snake is at (3,3), no body, so (3,4) should be free unless obstacle or wall.\n\n(3,4): x=3, y=4. Walls are only at borders, so y=4 is not border. Internal obstacles: (1,4), (2,4), (4,4) are obstacles, but (3,4) is not listed, so it should be free. Food? Food at (3,5), (2,2), (4,3), not (3,4), so empty cell.\n\nSimilarly, move D to (3,2): y=2, not border, no obstacle listed, no food, so empty.\n\nMove L to (2,3): x=2,y=3, not border, obstacles: (1,4), (2,4), (4,4), (5,6), (6,3) — (2,3) not listed, so free. Food? (2,2) is food, but (2,3) is not, so empty.\n\nMove R is invalid because opposite direction.\n\nNow, (4,3) has food, but I cannot move there directly because R is not allowed. But (4,3) is a food cell.\n\nSince I can only move U, D, or L for turn 0.\n\nI need to think ahead to maximize score and survive.\n\nFood at (4,3) is very close, but I cannot go there immediately because I can't move right.\n\nI could move in a way to approach it later.\n\nAlso, there's food at (3,5) and (2,2).\n\nLife span: all have life span 10, so they will disappear after 10 turns, but since we start at turn 0, and each turn decreases life span, so after 10 turns from now, they vanish. But we might not need to worry immediately.\n\nSince snake is length 1, eating any food will increase length to 2.\n\nWhen snake eats food, it grows, so after eating, the tail stays or something? Standard snake: when you eat, you grow, so the next move, the tail doesn't move, so length increases.\n\nIn this case, since it's only head, after eating, it becomes head and tail at the same position? But positions are a list.\n\nLet's see the food mechanics: \"Length of snake +1\" for positive food, and it says when eaten, the snake grows.\n\nBut for the tail reward danger, it mentions when head is adjacent to tail, etc.\n\nInitially, no tail, so no issue.\n\nAfter eating, the snake will have a body.\n\nNow, let's list all cells:\n\nI should sketch a grid.\n\nSet up a grid with x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6 for simplicity, since walls are outside.\n\nx: 1 to 6, y: 1 to6.\n\nObstacles:\n\n(5,6) — x=5,y=6\n\n(1,4) — x=1,y=4\n\n(4,4) — x=4,y=4\n\n(2,4) — x=2,y=4\n\n(6,3) — x=6,y=3\n\nFood:\n\n(3,5) — x=3,y=5\n\n(2,2) — x=2,y=2\n\n(4,3) — x=4,y=3\n\nSnake: (3,3)\n\nNow, possible moves from (3,3) at turn 0:\n\n- U: to (3,4)\n\n- D: to (3,2)\n\n- L: to (2,3)\n\n(4,3) is food, but I can't go there directly.\n\nIf I move U to (3,4): cell (3,4) is empty. After moving, snake position becomes [(3,4)] since it was length 1, no growth.\n\nThen head direction becomes U.\n\nFood remains, life span decreases by 1, to 9 for all? Turn 0 action, after move, if not eaten, no change.\n\nTurn sequence: at turn t, I choose action, then move, then if head on food, eat it, then food life decrease, etc.\n\nFor turn 0: I choose action, move to new cell, if that cell has food, I eat it, snake grows, and that food is removed.\n\nIf no food, snake moves, no growth.\n\nSince length 1, moving to empty cell, snake is now at new position, still length 1.\n\nThen for next turn.\n\nSimilarly, if I move to food, I eat, snake becomes length 2, with head at food position and tail at previous position? Let's see.\n\nSnake positions list: initially [(3,3)], head at (3,3).\n\nIf I move to a cell with food, say (4,3), but I can't, but suppose I could.\n\nAfter eating, the snake grows, so positions should be [new head, old head] or something.\n\nTypically, when snake moves and eats, the head moves to new cell, and the tail doesn't move, so positions become [new position] + old positions, so length increases by one.\n\nFor example, from (3,3), move to (4,3) and eat, then snake becomes [(4,3), (3,3)] — head at (4,3), tail at (3,3).\n\nThen next move, if I move, say, up to (4,4), but (4,4) is obstacle? (4,4) is internal obstacle, so cannot move there.\n\nIn this case, if I eat (4,3), but I can't because I can't move right now.\n\nBut let's not digress.\n\nBack to turn 0 actions.\n\nOption 1: Move U to (3,4)\n\nThen snake at (3,4), head direction U.\n\nNo food eaten, so length still 1.\n\nFood life span: all decrease to 9? Turn 0, after action, life span decreases.\n\nThe rule: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo at turn t, after action, all food life span decrease by 1.\n\nIf life span reaches 0, food disappears.\n\nHere all have life span 10 at turn 0, so after turn 0 action, they go to 9.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nOption 2: Move D to (3,2)\n\nThen snake at (3,2), head direction D.\n\n(3,2) is empty, no food.\n\nOption 3: Move L to (2,3)\n\nThen snake at (2,3), head direction L.\n\n(2,3) empty, no food.\n\nNow, from there, I need to plan ahead to eat food.\n\nFood at (4,3) is close, but I can't go directly. I can go around.\n\n(4,3) is at x=4,y=3, which is right of (3,3), but I can't move right.\n\nIf I move up to (3,4), then from there, I can move right to (4,4), but (4,4) is obstacle! (4,4) is internal obstacle, so I can't go to (4,4).\n\nSimilarly, if I move down to (3,2), then from (3,2), I can move right to (4,2), then up to (4,3), but (4,2) is free? Let's see.\n\n(4,2): x=4,y=2, not border, not in obstacles, not food, so free.\n\nThen from (4,2) to (4,3) is up, and (4,3) is food.\n\nSimilarly, if I move left to (2,3), then from (2,3) I can move down to (2,2), which is food.\n\n(2,2) has food.\n\nOr I can go other ways.\n\nI need to think about the path to food and risks.\n\nSince all food is positive, I should try to eat one soon to grow, because with length 1, I have more flexibility, but growing might help me reach other food, but also increases collision risk, but now no body.\n\nAfter eating, I have a tail.\n\nLet's consider the options for turn 0.\n\nFirst, if I move U to (3,4):\n\n- Turn 0: move U to (3,4), no eat, snake at [(3,4)], dir U.\n\nThen turn 1: from (3,4), head dir U, so possible moves: U, D, L, R? But no instant reverse, current dir U, so cannot move D (down).\n\nSo can move U to (3,5), L to (2,4), R to (4,4)\n\nBut (3,5) has food, (2,4) is obstacle, (4,4) is obstacle.\n\n(2,4) is internal obstacle, so invalid. Similarly (4,4) obstacle.\n\nSo only possible move is U to (3,5), which has food.\n\nSo if I move U at turn 0, then at turn 1, I must move U to (3,5) and eat the food.\n\nThen snake grows to length 2: positions [(3,5), (3,4)] — head at (3,5), tail at (3,4).\n\nHead direction U.\n\nThen food (3,5) is eaten, so removed.\n\nOther food: (2,2) and (4,3) remain, life span now 9 after turn 0, then after turn 1, decrease to 8.\n\nNow, from (3,5), dir U, possible moves: U to (3,6), D to (3,4), L to (2,5), R to (4,5)\n\nBut (3,4) is tail, but since the tail will move when I move, I can move to (3,4) only if the tail moves away, but at this point, positions are head (3,5) and tail (3,4).\n\nIf I move down to (3,4), which is where the tail is, but in snake games, moving to the tail cell is usually allowed because the tail moves forward, so head and tail swap, no collision.\n\nThe collision rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo moving to tail cell is safe.\n\nSimilarly, moving to other body cells is deadly.\n\nHere, body segments: only tail at (3,4), so moving to (3,4) is safe.\n\nAlso, U to (3,6): y=6, but y=6 is not wall? Walls at y=0 and y=7, so y=6 is playable, but y=7 is wall. y=6 is within 1 to 6, I think. Grid y from 0 to 7, walls y=0 and y=7, so y=6 is not wall.\n\nx from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? y=1 to y=6, since y=0 and y=7 walls.\n\nSimilarly x.\n\n(3,6): x=3,y=6, not border, obstacles: (5,6) is obstacle, but (3,6) not listed, so should be free.\n\nFood? No food at (3,6), so empty.\n\nL to (2,5): x=2,y=5, not border, not obstacle, not food, empty.\n\nR to (4,5): similarly, free.\n\nD to (3,4): tail, safe.\n\nNow, if I go to (3,5) at turn 1, I ate food, so now I need to move from there.\n\nBut let's not get ahead; I'm considering the turn 0 move.\n\nIf I move U at turn 0, then I must move U at turn 1 to (3,5) and eat, growing to length 2.\n\nThen at turn 2, I have options.\n\nBut let's see other turn 0 options.\n\nSecond option for turn 0: move D to (3,2)\n\nThen snake at (3,2), dir D.\n\nNo eat.\n\nThen turn 1: from (3,2), dir D, cannot move U (up), so possible moves: D to (3,1), L to (2,2), R to (4,2)\n\n(3,1): y=1, not wall (y=0 wall), so playable. Not obstacle, not food, empty.\n\n(2,2) has food.\n\n(4,2) empty.\n\nSo I can move to (2,2) and eat, or to (3,1) or (4,2).\n\nIf I move L to (2,2), eat food, grow to [(2,2), (3,2)] head (2,2), tail (3,2), dir L? After moving to (2,2), head direction L.\n\nThen similar.\n\nThird option for turn 0: move L to (2,3)\n\nSnake at (2,3), dir L.\n\nNo eat.\n\nTurn 1: from (2,3), dir L, cannot move R (right), so possible: U to (2,4), D to (2,2), L to (1,3)\n\nBut (2,4) is obstacle! Internal obstacle (2,4), so cannot move there.\n\n(2,2) has food.\n\n(1,3): x=1,y=3, not border (x=0 border), so playable. Not obstacle? Obstacles: (1,4) is obstacle, but (1,3) not listed, so free. No food.\n\nSo possible moves: D to (2,2) or L to (1,3), cannot U to (2,4) obstacle.\n\nIf I move D to (2,2), eat food, grow to [(2,2), (2,3)] head (2,2), tail (2,3), dir D.\n\nNow, back to turn 0 choices.\n\nI need to think which one allows me to get more food or safer.\n\nThe food at (4,3) is still there, and I might be able to get it later.\n\nAlso, after eating one, I have a tail, so I need to be careful.\n\nMoreover, tail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail cell has food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nBut for now, no issue.\n\nLet's think about the (4,3) food. It's at (4,3), and I'm at (3,3), but I can't go directly right.\n\nIf I don't go for it soon, it might be harder later, but life span 10, so I have time.\n\nBut other food too.\n\nPerhaps I can go for (2,2) first.\n\nLet's list the distances or paths.\n\nFrom current (3,3), to (2,2): I can move L to (2,3), then D to (2,2) — 2 moves.\n\nOr move D to (3,2), then L to (2,2) — 2 moves.\n\nSimilarly to (3,5): move U to (3,4), then U to (3,5) — 2 moves.\n\nTo (4,3): directly, but can't. So I need to go around.\n\nFor example, move D to (3,2), then R to (4,2), then U to (4,3) — 3 moves.\n\nOr move U to (3,4), then I can't go right because (4,4) obstacle, so from (3,4) I could go left to (2,4), but (2,4) obstacle, or right to (4,4) obstacle, or up to (3,5). So only up to (3,5) is possible from (3,4), as we saw.\n\nFrom (3,4), only (3,5) is possible move, since (2,4) and (4,4) are obstacles.\n\nIn that case, if I go to (3,4), I must go to (3,5) next and eat it.\n\nThen I'm at (3,5) with tail at (3,4).\n\nNow from (3,5), I can go to other places.\n\nBut the food at (4,3) is still there.\n\nHow to get to (4,3) from (3,5)?\n\n(3,5) to (4,3): need to go right and down.\n\nPossible: from (3,5), move R to (4,5), then from (4,5), I can move D to (4,4), but (4,4) is obstacle! Cannot.\n\nFrom (4,5), move D to (4,4) not possible.\n\nMove L to (2,5)? But (2,5) is free.\n\nThen from (2,5) to where? To get to (4,3), I need to go down and right, but obstacles at (2,4) and (4,4), so it might be messy.\n\nFrom (3,5), move D to (3,4), but (3,4) is tail, and if I move down, to (3,4), which is tail, but since tail moves, it should be safe.\n\nAfter moving to (3,4), the tail was at (3,4), but when head moves to (3,4), since it's the tail, and tail moves away? Let's think.\n\nAt positions: head (3,5), tail (3,4)\n\nI move down to (3,4). After move, the head is at (3,4), and the tail was at (3,4), but when head moves to tail, the tail moves forward? No.\n\nStandard snake movement: when snake moves, head goes to new cell, and each segment moves to the next position, so tail cell becomes empty if no growth.\n\nBut when eating, tail doesn't move.\n\nHere, if I move and don't eat, head moves to new cell, and tail is removed.\n\nSo from head (3,5) and tail (3,4), if I move down to (3,4), which is the tail position.\n\nAfter moving, the head is now at (3,4), and since I didn't eat, the tail (which was at (3,4)) is removed, so the new positions are just [(3,4)]? No.\n\nPositions: before move: [ (3,5), (3,4) ] head at (3,5), body at (3,4).\n\nI move down to (3,4). The new head position is (3,4). Since I moved to a cell without food (assuming), no growth, so the tail is removed. The tail was at (3,4), but the head is moving to (3,4), which is the same cell.\n\nWhen head moves to a cell, if it's the tail cell, and no growth, then after move, the head is at that cell, and the tail is gone, so snake length decreases? That doesn't make sense.\n\nI think I have a confusion.\n\nIn snake games, when the head moves to a new cell:\n\n- If the new cell has food, the snake grows: head is at new cell, and the tail remains, so positions: [new head] + [all previous positions], length increases.\n\n- If no food, the snake moves: head to new cell, and the tail is removed, so positions: [new head] + [all previous positions except the last one], so length same.\n\nThe key point is that the tail segment is removed only if no growth.\n\nBut when moving to the tail cell, it's a special case.\n\nSuppose positions: [A, B] where A is head, B is tail.\n\nI move to a cell C.\n\nIf C is not B and not food, then new positions: [C, A] , so tail is A now, B is removed.\n\nIf C is food and not B, then new positions: [C, A, B] , head C, tail B.\n\nIf C is B and no food, then moving to tail: C = B, so new head at B, and since no growth, the tail (B) is removed, but B is the cell, so positions become [B], which is just the head, meaning the snake shrinks to length 1.\n\nBut that might not be intended.\n\nThe rule says: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo in this case, when head moves to tail cell, the tail moves away, so it's safe, and no collision.\n\nFor example, from [A, B], move to B (tail cell).\n\nAfter move: head is at B, and since tail was at B, but it moves forward? The tail segment is removed because no growth, so the new positions should be [B], with only head, and the body is gone.\n\nBut that means the snake shortens, which is odd.\n\nPerhaps the tail moves first or something.\n\nI think there's a misunderstanding.\n\nLet me read the collision rule again.\n\n\"**But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.**\"\n\nIt implies that when you move to the tail cell, the tail moves away at the same time, so the cell is free when head arrives, but since it's the same cell, it's confusing.\n\nIn standard implementation, moving to the tail cell is allowed because after the move, the tail is no longer there, so the head can occupy it without collision, and the snake length remains the same if no growth.\n\nFor example, positions [ (3,5), (3,4) ], head (3,5), tail (3,4).\n\nMove down to (3,4). The new head position is (3,4). Since no food at (3,4), no growth, so the tail is removed. The tail was at (3,4), so it is removed, and the new positions are [ (3,4) ], with only the head, length 1.\n\nBut that means the snake shortens, which is not typical. Usually, the body moves, so the tail moves to the previous position of the next segment, but here only two segments.\n\nWhen moving, the head moves to new cell, and each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n\nSo for snake of length 2: segments S0 (head) and S1 (tail).\n\nMove head to new position P.\n\nThen S1 moves to where S0 was.\n\nSo new positions: head at P, tail at old S0 position.\n\nIf P is the old tail position, say S1 was at T, and I move to T.\n\nThen new head at T, new tail at old S0 position.\n\nSo for example, old positions: S0 at (3,5), S1 at (3,4)\n\nMove to (3,4) which is S1 position.\n\nNew head position: (3,4)\n\nThen S1 moves to old S0 position, which is (3,5)\n\nSo new positions: [ (3,4), (3,5) ] with head at (3,4), tail at (3,5)\n\nAnd since no food, no growth.\n\nSo the snake has moved, and now head is at (3,4), tail at (3,5).\n\nIt's like the snake reversed direction.\n\nSimilarly, if I had moved to a different cell.\n\nIn this case, moving to tail cell is safe, and the tail moves to the previous head position.\n\nNo shortening.\n\nSimilarly, if I move to a cell with food, then no tail movement, so positions grow.\n\nBack to the case.\n\nIn the turn 0 move U option, if I go to (3,4), then to (3,5) eat food, then at (3,5) with tail at (3,4).\n\nThen from there, I can move to (3,4) down, which is tail, so after move, head at (3,4), tail at (3,5), so positions [(3,4), (3,5)] head down or something.\n\nBut let's not complicate.\n\nPerhaps for turn 0, moving U is good because I can eat (3,5) quickly in two turns.\n\nSimilarly, moving D to (3,2), then I can eat (2,2) or go to (4,2) then to (4,3).\n\nMoving L to (2,3), then I can eat (2,2) quickly.\n\nBut (4,3) is also close, but I can't access it directly.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (4,3) is on the same row, but with obstacle at (4,4), so from below or above.\n\nLet's list all possible paths.\n\nI am considering the value of each food, all same +1, so no preference.\n\nBut I need to avoid dead ends.\n\nFor example, if I go to (3,4), I am forced to go to (3,5) next, then I have to move away, and the area might be constrained.\n\nAfter eating (3,5), I am at (3,5) with tail at (3,4).\n\nThen I can move:\n\n- U to (3,6): free, then from there\n\n- D to (3,4): tail, safe, move to (3,4), tail to (3,5), so head at (3,4), tail at (3,5)\n\n- L to (2,5): free\n\n- R to (4,5): free\n\n(3,6) is free, (2,5) free, (4,5) free.\n\nThen from there, I can go to (4,3) for example.\n\nFrom (4,5), I can move D to (4,4), but (4,4) obstacle, cannot.\n\nMove L to (3,5), but (3,5) is tail? Not necessarily.\n\nFrom (4,5), I can move D? (4,4) obstacle, so cannot move down from (4,5).\n\nOnly left to (3,5), or right to (5,5), or up to (4,6), or down not possible.\n\n(4,6): y=6, not wall, obstacles: (5,6) is obstacle, (4,6) not listed, so free.\n\nSimilarly, (5,5): free.\n\nBut I need to get to (4,3).\n\nFrom (4,5), I can move L to (3,5), but (3,5) is where the tail is or was.\n\nAfter moving from (3,5) to say (4,5), positions head (4,5), tail (3,5) if no grow.\n\nThen from (4,5), move L to (3,5), which is tail, so safe, head to (3,5), tail to (4,5), etc.\n\nBut to reach (4,3), I need to go down.\n\nBut (4,4) is blocked, so I have to go around.\n\nFor example, from (4,5) move to (5,5), then (5,4), but (5,4) free? Then to (5,3), then left to (4,3).\n\n(5,4): x=5,y=4, not obstacle, not wall, free.\n\n(5,3): similarly free.\n\nThen to (4,3).\n\nBut it's longer.\n\nFrom the south, from (3,2) or something.\n\nBut let's compare the turn 0 options.\n\nPerhaps moving towards (2,2) or (4,3) is better because the area is less constrained.\n\nLet's consider moving D at turn 0.\n\nTurn 0: move D to (3,2), dir D, no eat.\n\nThen turn 1: from (3,2), dir D, cannot move U, so moves: D to (3,1), L to (2,2), R to (4,2)\n\n(3,1): y=1, not wall, free, no food.\n\n(2,2): food.\n\n(4,2): free.\n\nIf I move L to (2,2), eat food, grow to [(2,2), (3,2)] head (2,2), tail (3,2), dir L.\n\nThen I can move to (4,3) from there.\n\nFrom (2,2), head dir L, possible moves: U to (2,3), D to (2,1), L to (1,2), R not allowed (reverse).\n\n(2,3) is free, (2,1) free, (1,2) free.\n\n(2,3) was empty, no food.\n\nI can move U to (2,3), then from (2,3), I can move R to (3,3), but (3,3) might be free now, or to (2,4) but obstacle, so only U, D, L, but dir from (2,2) to (2,3) is U, so head dir U.\n\nThen from (2,3), move to (3,3) R, or to (1,3) L, or U to (2,4) obstacle, D to (2,2) tail or something.\n\nBut to get to (4,3), from (2,2), I can move R to (3,2) but that's tail, or not directly.\n\nFrom (2,2), move U to (2,3), then from (2,3) move R to (3,3), then from (3,3) move R to (4,3) but at that point, dir from (3,3) to (4,3) is R, but current dir when at (3,3) would be R if I came from left.\n\nBut let's sequence.\n\nAfter eating at (2,2), positions [(2,2), (3,2)] head (2,2) dir L.\n\nTurn 1: moved to (2,2), so after turn 1, snake at [(2,2), (3,2)], food eaten, etc.\n\nThen turn 2: from (2,2), dir L (since moved left to here? From (3,2) to (2,2) is left, so dir L.\n\nPossible moves: U (up) to (2,3), D (down) to (2,1), L (left) to (1,2), R (right) to (3,2) but (3,2) is tail.\n\nR to (3,2) is possible since tail.\n\nIf I move U to (2,3), then new head (2,3), tail moves to (2,2), so positions [(2,3), (2,2)] head U.\n\nThen turn 3: from (2,3), dir U, can move U to (2,4) but obstacle, cannot; D to (2,2) tail; L to (1,3); R to (3,3)\n\nSo move R to (3,3), which is free, then positions [(3,3), (2,3)] head R.\n\nThen turn 4: from (3,3), dir R, can move R to (4,3) which has food, so eat, grow to [(4,3), (3,3), (2,3)] head (4,3), tail (2,3), length 3.\n\nSo I can reach (4,3) in 4 turns from start if I go this way.\n\nFrom turn 0: turn 0 move D to (3,2), turn 1 move L to (2,2) eat, turn 2 move U to (2,3), turn 3 move R to (3,3), turn 4 move R to (4,3) eat.\n\nBut at turn 4, move to (4,3) and eat.\n\nSimilarly, if I go directly from (3,2) to (4,2) then to (4,3).\n\nTurn 0 move D to (3,2), turn 1 move R to (4,2), no eat, then turn 2 move U to (4,3) eat.\n\nQuicker to (4,3).\n\nTurn 0: move D to (3,2)\n\nTurn 1: from (3,2) dir D, move R to (4,2), so head to (4,2), no food ( (4,2) no food), so snake moves to [(4,2), (3,2)] head (4,2) dir R.\n\nThen turn 2: from (4,2), dir R, possible moves: U to (4,3), D to (4,1), L to (3,2), R to (5,2)\n\n(4,3) has food, so move U to (4,3) eat, grow to [(4,3), (4,2), (3,2)] head (4,3) dir U.\n\nSo I eat (4,3) at turn 2.\n\nThen I have snake of length 3.\n\nSimilarly, I could have eaten (2,2) first.\n\nBut in this case, by moving D at turn 0, I can eat (4,3) by turn 2.\n\nIf I move L at turn 0 to (2,3), then turn 1 move D to (2,2) eat, then from (2,2) I can go to (4,3) but it takes more turns as above.\n\nOr from (2,3) turn 1 move to (1,3) or something, but not direct.\n\nSo moving D to (3,2) seems better for reaching (4,3).\n\nIf I move U at turn 0 to (3,4), then turn 1 must move U to (3,5) eat, then at turn 2 I am at (3,5) with tail (3,4), and I need to go to (4,3), which is harder because of the obstacle at (4,4).\n\nFor example, from (3,5) I can move R to (4,5), then from (4,5) I can move to (5,5) or (4,6) or (3,5), but not down.\n\nThen to (5,5), then (5,4), then (5,3), then (4,3), but (5,3) to (4,3) is left, so several turns.\n\nAt least 4 turns from (3,5) to (4,3): e.g., (3,5) to (4,5), to (5,5), to (5,4), to (5,3), to (4,3) — 5 moves, but since I need to move the snake, each turn.\n\nFrom turn 2 position (3,5), to (4,3) in min 4 moves: e.g., move R to (4,5), then D not possible, so move to (5,5), then to (5,4), then to (5,3), then to (4,3). That's 4 moves, so at turn 6 I reach (4,3).\n\nBut food life span: at turn 0, life 10, after turn 0, 9; turn 1, 8; turn 2, 7; ... so by turn 6, life would be 10-6=4, still ok, but it takes longer.\n\nWhereas if I go for (4,3) directly via south, I can eat by turn 2.\n\nSimilarly, for (2,2), I can eat it easily from other paths.\n\nBut (2,2) is also accessible.\n\nNow, the food at (3,5) can be eaten early if I go north, but then (4,3) might be harder.\n\nSince all food same value, and I need to survive, perhaps eating (4,3) first is better because it's in a more open area.\n\n(4,3) has obstacle at (4,4) above, but below is free.\n\nSimilarly, (2,2) has obstacles at (2,4), (1,4) above, but below free.\n\n(3,5) has obstacles around.\n\nBut with internal obstacles, the north area might be more constrained.\n\nFor example, from (3,5), to go south, I can move to (3,4), which is tail, but then I can go to (3,3), etc.\n\nBut it might be fine.\n\nBut to maximize, I should go for the closest food I can reach safely.\n\n(4,3) is close, but I can't reach directly from (3,3) due to direction constraint.\n\nFrom (3,3), I can reach (4,3) in two moves via south: down to (3,2), then right to (4,2), then up to (4,3), but from (4,2) to (4,3) is up.\n\nIn terms of turns: turn 0 move D to (3,2), turn 1 move R to (4,2), turn 2 move U to (4,3) eat.\n\n3 turns including eating at turn 2.\n\nIf I go north to (3,5), turn 0 move U to (3,4), turn 1 move U to (3,5) eat, 2 turns to eat (3,5).\n\nBut after that, (4,3) is farther.\n\nSimilarly, to eat (2,2): from (3,3), move L to (2,3) turn 0, then turn 1 move D to (2,2) eat, 2 turns.\n\nOr move D to (3,2) turn 0, then turn 1 move L to (2,2) eat, also 2 turns.\n\nSo (2,2) and (3,5) can be eaten in 2 turns, (4,3) in 3 turns from start.\n\nBut since (4,3) takes one more turn, but all have life 10, it's fine.\n\nAfter eating one, I can eat others.\n\nBut the area around (3,5) has obstacles, so it might be risky to be there with longer snake.\n\nFor example, after eating (3,5), I am at (3,5), with tail (3,4), and I need to move.\n\nPossible moves: to (3,6), (2,5), (4,5), or (3,4).\n\nIf I move to (3,4), then positions head (3,4), tail (3,5), so I can then move to (3,3), etc.\n\nBut to reach (4,3), I need to go through (4,2) or something.\n\nFrom (3,4), I can move R to (4,4), but (4,4) obstacle, cannot.\n\nL to (2,4) obstacle, cannot.\n\nU to (3,5) tail or not.\n\nD to (3,3) free.\n\nSo only U or D, but U to (3,5) is tail, or D to (3,3).\n\nSo from (3,4), only down to (3,3) or up to (3,5).\n\nIf I move down to (3,3), then from (3,3) I can go to (4,3) but direction: from (3,4) to (3,3) is down, so dir D, then from (3,3) dir D, can move L, R, D, not U.\n\nThen move R to (4,3) eat.\n\nBut from (3,5) to (3,4) to (3,3) to (4,3), three moves to eat (4,3) from (3,5).\n\nAt turn 2 I am at (3,5), turn 3 move D to (3,4), turn 4 move D to (3,3), turn 5 move R to (4,3) eat.\n\nSo eat at turn 5.\n\nWhereas if I eat (4,3) first, at turn 2, as above.\n\nSimilarly, (2,2) can be eaten at turn 1 or 2.\n\nSo for long-term, eating (4,3) first might be better because it's in a less constrained area, and I can then go to other food.\n\nAlso, after eating (4,3), I am at (4,3) with tail, and I can go to (2,2) or (3,5).\n\n(2,2) is at (2,2), I can move left or down, etc.\n\nBut let's see the internal obstacles: (2,4), (1,4), (4,4), (5,6), (6,3)\n\n(6,3) is obstacle, so at x=6,y=3, which is near (4,3).\n\nFrom (4,3), after eating, positions say [(4,3), (4,2), (3,2)] or something, head at (4,3).\n\nThen I can move U, but (4,4) obstacle, cannot; D to (4,2) if tail, or not; L to (3,3); R to (5,3) but (6,3) obstacle, but (5,3) is free? x=5,y=3, not border, not obstacle, free.\n\nSo possible.\n\nSimilarly, down to (4,2), etc.\n\nBut no immediate danger.\n\nWhereas at (3,5), with (4,4) and (2,4) obstacles, it might be easier to get stuck.\n\nFor example, from (3,5), the only free moves are to (3,6), (2,5), (4,5), and (3,4) which might be body.\n\nBut (3,6) is free, (2,5) free, (4,5) free.\n\nThen from (2,5), I can move to (2,6), (1,5), (3,5), etc.\n\nBut to go south, I have to go through (3,4) or something, which might be occupied.\n\nBut with planning, it should be ok.\n\nBut to be safe, perhaps start with eating (4,3) via moving south.\n\nSo for turn 0, move D to (3,2).\n\nThen turn 1, move R to (4,2).\n\nThen turn 2, move U to (4,3) to eat.\n\nBut I need to output actions for multiple turns, think 5+ ahead.\n\nAlso, after that, I can go for other food.\n\nFor example, after eating (4,3), at turn 2, snake positions: let's say from turn 1, after move to (4,2), positions [(4,2), (3,2)] head (4,2) dir R.\n\nThen turn 2 move U to (4,3) eat, so grow, positions [(4,3), (4,2), (3,2)] head (4,3) dir U.\n\nThen turn 3: from (4,3), dir U, but U to (4,4) obstacle, cannot; so possible moves: D to (4,2), L to (3,3), R to (5,3)\n\n(4,2) is body, (3,2) is tail, (4,2) is the second segment.\n\nPositions: head (4,3), body (4,2), tail (3,2).\n\nSo moving to (4,2) would be body collision, since it's not tail.\n\nTail is at (3,2).\n\nMoving to (4,2) is deadly, because head touches body segment.\n\nOnly tail cell is safe to move into.\n\nSo from (4,3), possible moves:\n\n- D to (4,2): but (4,2) is occupied by body, not tail, so collision.\n\n- L to (3,3): free cell? (3,3) is empty now, no obstacle, no food, so safe.\n\n- R to (5,3): free, as above.\n\n- U not possible.\n\nSo I can move L to (3,3) or R to (5,3).\n\nSay I move L to (3,3), then new head (3,3), tail moves to (4,2)? Movement: head to (3,3), no eat, so tail removed, body moves: the segment at (4,2) moves to old head position (4,3)? Standard: when head moves to new cell, each segment moves to previous position of the segment before it.\n\nPositions: S0: (4,3), S1: (4,2), S2: (3,2)\n\nMove head to (3,3), no food, so new S0: (3,3)\n\nS1 moves to where S0 was, (4,3)\n\nS2 moves to where S1 was, (4,2)\n\nBut S2 is tail, so new positions: [ (3,3), (4,3), (4,2) ] head at (3,3), tail at (4,2)\n\nThen from there, I can go to (2,2) or other.\n\nBut (2,2) has food, life span decreasing.\n\nSimilarly, if I move R to (5,3), etc.\n\nBut let's plan the sequence.\n\nTo maximize, I should eat (4,3) first, then (2,2), then (3,5) if possible.\n\n(3,5) might expire, but life span 10, turns pass.\n\nSince I need to output for 5+ turns, I can plan a sequence.\n\nStart with turn 0: move D to (3,2)\n\nThen turn 1: from (3,2) dir D, move R to (4,2) — since I want to go to (4,3)\n\nAt turn 1, I could move to (2,2) but (4,3) is my target.\n\nSo move R to (4,2), no eat.\n\nSnake: [(4,2), (3,2)] head (4,2) dir R\n\nTurn 2: move U to (4,3) eat, so grow, positions [(4,3), (4,2), (3,2)] head (4,3) dir U\n\nNow, from here, as above, can move L to (3,3) or R to (5,3)\n\nI need to go to (2,2), so move L to (3,3)\n\nThen new positions: head to (3,3), no eat ( (3,3) no food), so new positions: [ (3,3), (4,3), (4,2) ] head (3,3) dir L (since moved left)\n\nNow, from (3,3), dir L, possible moves: U to (3,4), D to (3,2), L to (2,3), R not allowed (reverse)\n\n(3,2) is body? Positions: S0 (3,3), S1 (4,3), S2 (4,2)\n\n(3,2) is free, not occupied.\n\n(3,4) free, (2,3) free.\n\n(3,2) is empty, yes.\n\nSo I can move D to (3,2), or U to (3,4), or L to (2,3)\n\nI want to go to (2,2), so move L to (2,3)\n\nThen move to (2,3), no eat, new positions: head (2,3), S1 to (3,3), S2 to (4,3), so [ (2,3), (3,3), (4,3) ] head (2,3) dir L\n\nThen from (2,3), dir L, can move U to (2,4) obstacle, cannot; D to (2,2) food; L to (1,3); or R to (3,3) body.\n\nR to (3,3) is body, collision, deadly.\n\nL to (1,3) free.\n\nD to (2,2) has food.\n\nSo move D to (2,2) eat, grow, positions: head to (2,2), no tail move, so [ (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3) ] head (2,2) dir D\n\nNow, I have eaten two food, length 4.\n\nThen I can go to (3,5).\n\nBut (3,5) is at (3,5), life span: start 10, after turn 0:9, turn1:8, turn2:7, turn3:6 (after turn 3 action? Let's track turns.\n\nTurn 0: action move D, life decrease to 9 for all\n\nTurn 1: move R to (4,2), life decrease to 8\n\nTurn 2: move U to (4,3) eat, life decrease to 7 for remaining food\n\nTurn 3: move L to (3,3), life decrease to 6\n\nTurn 4: move L to (2,3), life decrease to 5\n\nTurn 5: move D to (2,2) eat, life decrease to 4 for (3,5)\n\nNow at turn 5, snake at [(2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3)] head (2,2) dir D\n\nNow from here, to go to (3,5).\n\n(3,5) is at y=5, x=3.\n\nFrom (2,2), I can move, but head dir D, so can move D to (2,1), L to (1,2), U not allowed (reverse), R to (3,2)\n\n(3,2) is free? Not occupied now.\n\nPositions: head (2,2), body (2,3), (3,3), (4,3)\n\nSo (3,2) empty.\n\nAlso (2,1) empty, (1,2) empty.\n\nI can move R to (3,2), then to (3,3) but (3,3) is body, collision.\n\nMove to (3,2), then from there.\n\nTurn 5: after move to (2,2), positions as above.\n\nTurn 6: from (2,2) dir D, move R to (3,2) — since I want to go up.\n\n(3,2) empty, no food, so move to (3,2), new head (3,2), tail moves: S1 to (2,2), S2 to (2,3), S3 to (3,3), tail (4,3) removed? Movement: head to (3,2), no eat, so new positions: [ (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3) ]? Segments: old S0 to (3,2), S1 to old S0 (2,2), S2 to old S1 (2,3), S3 to old S2 (3,3), and tail S3 was (4,3), removed.\n\nSo new positions: [ (3,2), (2,2), (2,3) ]? Length 4, so [ (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3) ] head (3,2), tail (3,3)\n\nThen head dir R (since moved right from (2,2)).\n\nThen from (3,2), dir R, can move U to (3,3), D to (3,1), L to (2,2), R to (4,2)\n\n(3,3) is tail, safe; (3,1) free; (2,2) body, collision; (4,2) free.\n\nMove U to (3,3), which is tail, so head to (3,3), tail to (3,2)? New positions: head (3,3), S1 to (3,2), S2 to (2,2), S3 to (2,3), so [ (3,3), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3) ] head (3,3) dir U\n\nThen from (3,3), dir U, can move U to (3,4), D not allowed, L to (2,3), R to (4,3)\n\n(2,3) is body, collision; (4,3) is body? Positions: S0 (3,3), S1 (3,2), S2 (2,2), S3 (2,3) — (4,3) not here.\n\n(4,3) was removed earlier.\n\n(3,4) free, (4,3) free now? Not occupied.\n\n(4,3) was eaten, not there.\n\nSo (3,4) free, (4,3) free.\n\nMove U to (3,4), no eat, then to (3,5) but (3,5) has food.\n\nFrom (3,3) move U to (3,4), then from (3,4) move U to (3,5) eat.\n\nBut at (3,4), it might be free.\n\nIn this path, it takes many turns to reach (3,5).\n\nFrom turn 5 position at (2,2), I could move directly but constrained.\n\nSince I have internal obstacles, and to reach (3,5), I need to go via (3,4) or other.\n\nBut (3,4) might be available.\n\nLife span of (3,5) at turn 6: after turn 5 action, life was 4, decrease to 3 at turn 6, etc.\n\nBy turn 8 or so I can eat it.\n\nBut it's possible.\n\nTo save time, for the initial choice, moving D at turn 0 allows me to eat (4,3) early and then (2,2), and (3,5) later.\n\nIf I move U at turn 0, I eat (3,5) early, but then (4,3) takes longer to reach.\n\nSince the grid has obstacles, the south and west might be easier to navigate.\n\nAnother point: the food at (4,3) is at (4,3), and there is an obstacle at (6,3), but not immediate issue.\n\nAlso, for the answer, I need to output actions for multiple turns, say 5 or 6 turns.\n\nBut the state is turn 0, so I should output from turn 0 to turn 5 or so.\n\nThe answer format is Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, etc.\n\nt1=0.\n\nSo for example, with moving D at turn 0.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 0: D (to (3,2))\n\nThen turn 1: R (to (4,2))\n\nTurn 2: U (to (4,3) eat)\n\nThen from there, as above, at turn 2 after eat, positions [(4,3),(4,2),(3,2)] head (4,3) dir U\n\nTurn 3: move L to (3,3) (as I planned earlier)\n\nAfter move to (3,3), no eat, positions [(3,3),(4,3),(4,2)] head (3,3) dir L\n\nTurn 4: move L to (2,3) (to go towards (2,2))\n\nTo (2,3), no eat, positions [(2,3),(3,3),(4,3)] head (2,3) dir L\n\nTurn 5: move D to (2,2) eat (since (2,2) food)\n\nThen positions after eat: [(2,2),(2,3),(3,3),(4,3)] head (2,2) dir D\n\nNow for turn 6, I can move R to (3,2) or something, but I need to think ahead.\n\nSince the instruction is to think 5+ turns ahead, I can output up to turn 5.\n\nAt turn 5, I have eaten (2,2), so I can stop or continue.\n\nBut I should plan the next moves.\n\nFrom turn 5 position, to go to (3,5), I can move, as before.\n\nBut for the answer, I can output turns 0 to 5.\n\nIn this sequence, at turn 5 I move to (2,2) and eat, so it's included.\n\nActions: turn 0 to turn 5.\n\nTurn 0: D\n\nTurn 1: R\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: L (to (3,3))\n\nTurn 4: L (to (2,3))\n\nTurn 5: D (to (2,2))\n\nAt turn 4, I moved to (2,3), which is fine.\n\nAt turn 5, move D to (2,2) eat.\n\nNow, is this safe? No immediate risk.\n\nIf I moved L at turn 0 to (2,3), then turn 1 move D to (2,2) eat, then I can go to (4,3), but it might take more turns.\n\nFor example, turn 0: L to (2,3)\n\nTurn 1: D to (2,2) eat, positions [(2,2),(2,3)] head (2,2) dir D\n\nThen turn 2: move U to (2,3) but (2,3) is tail, so safe, head to (2,3), tail to (2,2), positions [(2,3),(2,2)] head U? Moved up, dir U.\n\nThen turn 3: from (2,3) dir U, can move U to (2,4) obstacle, cannot; D to (2,2) tail; L to (1,3); R to (3,3)\n\nMove R to (3,3), positions [(3,3),(2,3)] head R\n\nThen turn 4: move R to (4,3) but (4,3) is not adjacent? (3,3) to (4,3) is right, so move R to (4,3) eat, positions [(4,3),(3,3),(2,3)] head (4,3) dir R\n\nThen turn 5: from (4,3) dir R, move to (5,3) or other.\n\nBut I ate (4,3) at turn 4, later than in the previous sequence.\n\nIn first sequence, ate (4,3) at turn 2.\n\nSimilarly, (3,5) can be eaten later.\n\nSo the first sequence seems more efficient.\n\nI could eat (3,5) first if I move U at turn 0.\n\nTurn 0: U to (3,4)\n\nTurn 1: U to (3,5) eat\n\nThen at turn 1, positions [(3,5),(3,4)] head U\n\nTurn 2: move D to (3,4) tail, safe, positions head (3,4), tail (3,5), dir D\n\nThen turn 3: move D to (3,3), positions [(3,3),(3,4)] head D\n\nTurn 4: move R to (4,3) eat, but (4,3) has food, so eat, positions [(4,3),(3,3),(3,4)] head R\n\nAte (4,3) at turn 4.\n\nThen turn 5: from (4,3) dir R, move to (5,3) or L to (3,3) but body, etc.\n\nAte (4,3) at turn 4, later than turn 2 in south approach.\n\nAnd (2,2) not eaten yet.\n\nSo for maximizing early score, the south approach is better.\n\nAlso, with obstacles, south might be safer.\n\nSo I think for turn 0, move D is best.\n\nThen for the sequence, I can output:\n\nTurn 0: D\n\nTurn 1: R\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nThen for turn 3, I need to choose.\n\nIn my first plan, I moved L to (3,3), but at turn 2 after eating (4,3), positions [(4,3),(4,2),(3,2)] head (4,3) dir U\n\nTurn 3: I can move L to (3,3) or R to (5,3)\n\n(3,3) is towards (2,2), so move L to (3,3)\n\nThen turn 4: from (3,3) dir L, move L to (2,3)\n\nThen turn 5: from (2,3) dir L, move D to (2,2) eat\n\nBut at turn 5, I eat (2,2), so it's good.\n\nI could move directly after turn 2.\n\nAnother option: at turn 2, after eating (4,3), instead of moving L, I could move R to (5,3), but that might lead away from (2,2).\n\nNot efficient.\n\nSo the sequence is fine.\n\nNow for the answer, I need to output actions for several turns.\n\nSince t1=0, output Turn 0, Turn 1, ..., up to say Turn 5.\n\nAt Turn 5, I move to (2,2) and eat.\n\nNow, to think ahead, after that, I can go to (3,5), but not necessary for output.\n\nAlso, life span of (3,5) is still ok.\n\nIn this sequence, I eat two food by turn 5.\n\nIf I go north, I eat one by turn 1, but the second later.\n\nSo better.\n\nThus, actions:\n\nTurn 0: D\n\nTurn 1: R\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: L (to (3,3))\n\nTurn 4: L (to (2,3))\n\nTurn 5: D (to (2,2))\n\nIn turn 4, moving to (2,3), and turn 5 to (2,2).\n\nAt turn 3, I am at (3,3) with dir L, then move L to (2,3), yes.\n\nNow, is there any risk? For example, at turn 2, when I move U to (4,3), it might be that the food is under body, but at that point, no, because positions are [(4,3),(4,2),(3,2)], and I move to (4,3) which is head now.\n\nNo issue.\n\nSimilarly, other moves.\n\nSo I think this is good.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score and ensure long-term survival, the AI must plan multiple turns ahead, considering food locations, life spans, obstacles, and movement constraints. The current state (turn \\(t_1 = 0\\)) has the snake at position (3,3) with head direction left (L). Food is available at (3,5), (2,2), and (4,3), all with value +1 and life span 10. Internal obstacles are at (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), and (6,3), and walls border the grid at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.\n\n### Key Considerations for Planning:\n- **Immediate Moves (Turn 0)**: The snake can move up (U), down (D), or left (L) from (3,3), but not right (R) due to the no-instant-reverse rule (current direction L). Moving down (D) to (3,2) is chosen to enable a path to the food at (4,3) while avoiding the obstacle-rich north area near (3,5).\n- **Food Prioritization**: The food at (4,3) is reachable in fewer turns via the south, allowing an early score increase. Eating (4,3) by turn 2 sets up access to (2,2) by turn 5. The food at (3,5) is deferred as it is in a constrained area with obstacles, making it riskier with a longer snake.\n- **Risk Avoidance**: Moving south initially avoids potential dead ends near (3,5) (e.g., obstacles at (2,4) and (4,4) limit movement). After eating, the snake must avoid body collisions and leverage tail movement rules for safe navigation.\n- **Life Span Management**: All food has life span 10 at turn 0, decreasing each turn. By eating (4,3) at turn 2 (life span 7 remaining) and (2,2) at turn 5 (life span 5 remaining), both are consumed well before expiration. (3,5) can be targeted after turn 5 with life span still sufficient.\n- **5+ Turn Plan**: The sequence below eats two food items, increasing length to 4 by turn 5, and positions the snake to safely pursue (3,5) or other food later. Paths are chosen to minimize risk and maximize open space movement.\n\n### Planned Action Sequence (Turns 0 to 5):\n- **Turn 0**: Move down (D) to (3,2).  \n  - Reason: Avoids reverse move, starts path to (4,3). Position: [(3,2)], head direction D. Food life spans decrease to 9.\n- **Turn 1**: Move right (R) to (4,2).  \n  - Reason: Continues toward (4,3). Current direction D, so R is allowed (not reverse). Position: [(4,2), (3,2)], head direction R. Food life spans decrease to 8.\n- **Turn 2**: Move up (U) to (4,3) and eat the food (+1 score, length increases to 3).  \n  - Reason: Eats (4,3) efficiently. Position: [(4,3), (4,2), (3,2)], head direction U. Food at (4,3) removed; life spans of remaining food decrease to 7.\n- **Turn 3**: Move left (L) to (3,3).  \n  - Reason: Heads toward (2,2) in open space. Current direction U, so L is allowed. Position: [(3,3), (4,3), (4,2)], head direction L. Food life spans decrease to 6.\n- **Turn 4**: Move left (L) to (2,3).  \n  - Reason: Approaches (2,2). Current direction L, so L is allowed. Position: [(2,3), (3,3), (4,3)], head direction L. Food life spans decrease to 5.\n- **Turn 5**: Move down (D) to (2,2) and eat the food (+1 score, length increases to 4).  \n  - Reason: Eats (2,2) safely. Current direction L, so D is allowed (not reverse). Position: [(2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3)], head direction D. Food at (2,2) removed; life span of (3,5) decreases to 4.\n\n### Long-Term Outlook (Beyond Turn 5):\n- The snake is at (2,2) with head direction down (D). (3,5) is still available (life span 4 at turn 5 end) and can be reached via a safe path (e.g., move right to (3,2) at turn 6, then navigate up while avoiding obstacles). The sequence achieves two food eats by turn 5 with minimal risk, prioritizing open areas and efficient movement. Survival is ensured by avoiding constrained regions and leveraging the grid's southern and western areas, which have fewer obstacles.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 0\\text{: D} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 1\\text{: R} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 2\\text{: U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 3\\text{: L} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 4\\text{: L} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 5\\text{: D} \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I'm the AI playing Snake. I need to maximize my score by eating positive food while avoiding risks. I must think at least 5 turns ahead and prioritize long-term survival over immediate rewards.\n\nCurrent state at turn 1:\n\n- **Walls**: Border cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid is from (0,0) to (7,7), and borders are walls. Also, internal obstacles at (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3).\n\n- **Snake Positions**: Only one segment at (3,2). That means the snake is just the head right now, no body. So length is 1.\n\n- **Snake Head Direction**: Down (D). So it's moving down.\n\n- **Food**: \n  - (3,5) with value 1, life span 9\n  - (2,2) with value 1, life span 9\n  - (4,3) with value 1, life span 9\n  - (6,4) with value 1, life span 10\n\nAll food has positive value, +1 each. No negative food mentioned here. Life spans are long: 9 and 10 turns, so they'll disappear after turn 9 or 10, but since we're at turn 1, we have time.\n\nSince the snake has only one segment, the head, there's no body to worry about collisions except walls and obstacles. Also, tail collision isn't an issue yet because there's no tail.\n\nCurrent head position: (3,2), direction Down. So moving down would go to (3,1), but y=0 is a wall, so moving down to (3,1) might be invalid? Let's check the grid.\n\nGrid is from (0,0) to (7,7). y=0 is the bottom wall, y=7 is top? Typically in grids, (0,0) might be bottom-left or top-left. But in this context, since head is at (3,2) and moving down, probably y decreases as we go down, so (3,2) to (3,1) would be down, and (3,0) would be the wall.\n\ny=0 is a wall, so moving to (3,1) is possible? y=0 is wall, but (3,1) has y=1, which is above y=0, so it should be free unless occupied.\n\nLet's list all wall cells:\n\n- Border: x=0, x=7 for all y? No, it says \"x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7\", so cells where x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. So for example, (0,0), (0,1), ..., (0,7), (7,0), (7,1), ..., (7,7), and similarly for y=0 and y=7, but since y=0 and y=7 are covered.\n\nAlso internal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3)\n\nNow, snake head at (3,2), moving down. Down means decreasing y, so from (3,2) to (3,1). (3,1): is it a wall? y=1 is not 0, so not border wall. Internal obstacles: none at (3,1), so it should be free.\n\nBut (3,1) has y=1, which is greater than 0, so not wall. Similarly, (3,0) is wall, but (3,1) is fine.\n\nFood locations: (3,5), (2,2), (4,3), (6,4)\n\n(2,2) is right where the head is? Head is at (3,2), food at (2,2), so different cell.\n\nHead at (3,2), food at (2,2) is left, (4,3) is right and up, (3,5) is down? y=5 is above y=2? Let's clarify coordinates.\n\nAssume (0,0) is bottom-left, so y increases up, or top-left? Typically in such games, (0,0) might be top-left with y increasing down, or bottom-left with y increasing up.\n\nThe direction: head direction is Down, and moving down to (x,y-1) or what? The movement: U (x,y+1), D (x,y-1), L (x-1,y), R (x+1,y)\n\nSo for U, y increases, so probably y=0 at bottom, y increasing up. So (3,2) moving down D to (3,1), which is down, y decreases.\n\nSimilarly, U to (3,3), y increases, up.\n\nFood at (3,5): x=3,y=5, which is above (3,2) since y=5 > y=2.\n\n(2,2): x=2,y=2, left of head.\n\n(4,3): x=4,y=3, right and up a bit.\n\n(6,4): x=6,y=4.\n\nNow, since snake has only head, moving to a cell with food will eat it, growing to length 2.\n\nBut I need to think ahead.\n\nFirst, possible moves from (3,2) with current direction Down.\n\nI can move U, D, L, R, but no instant reverse. Current direction is Down, so I cannot move Up immediately, because Up is opposite to Down.\n\nDirections: U and D are opposites, L and R are opposites.\n\nSo from Down, I cannot move Up next. So forbidden moves: Up.\n\nAllowed: Down, Left, Right.\n\nNow, check each option:\n\n- Down (D) to (3,1): is it safe? (3,1) is not wall, no obstacle, no body (since no body), so safe. No food there, so no eat.\n\n- Left (L) to (2,2): (2,2) has food! Value +1, life span 9. So if I move to (2,2), I eat the food, snake grows to length 2, head now at (2,2), and a tail at previous position (3,2).\n\n- Right (R) to (4,2): (4,2) no food, I think? Food at (4,3), not (4,2). So empty, move to (4,2), no eat.\n\nBut (4,2) is safe? Let's confirm coordinates.\n\nHead at (3,2), R to (4,2). (4,2) not wall, no obstacle, should be fine.\n\nNow, I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n\nAlso, food life spans: all have 9 or 10, so they'll be there for a while.\n\nBut (2,2) is right next to me, and I can eat it by moving left.\n\nHowever, after eating, snake becomes length 2, head at (2,2), tail at (3,2).\n\nThen I need to move from there.\n\nBut let's consider the risks.\n\nThere's a food at (2,2), which is adjacent. But also, since snake is short, tail collision isn't an issue yet because the tail moves away when I move.\n\nRule: after eating, when I eat, I grow immediately, so after moving to food, the snake adds a segment, so the tail is the previous position.\n\nThen when I move next, the tail moves, so unless I move back into the tail, it might not collide immediately.\n\nBut with length 2, if head moves to where tail was, it might collide if tail hasn't moved, but in snake, when you move, head goes new position, tail follows or stays if growing.\n\nStandard snake: when you eat, you grow, so after eating, the tail doesn't move on the next turn; the new position becomes part of the body.\n\nLet's clarify the movement.\n\nFrom the rules: when head moves to a cell with food, it eats, length increases by 1 for positive food.\n\nThen, on the next move, the snake moves: head to new cell, and each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, so the tail segment moves away from its position.\n\nBut when you eat, on the turn you eat, the head moves to food cell, and a new tail segment is added at the previous tail position or something? I need to read.\n\nThe rules don't specify the exact movement mechanics, but from common snake behavior: when you eat, the head moves to the food, and the tail does not advance, so the snake grows by one segment.\n\nFor example, if snake is [head, body, tail], and head moves to food, then snake becomes [new head, head, body, tail], so the tail stays, and a new segment is added where the head was before eating? No.\n\nStandard: positions are a list. When head moves to a new cell without eating, the head goes to new cell, and the tail cell is removed. If eating, the head goes to food cell, and the tail is not removed, so the snake grows by one cell; the new segment is added at the position where the tail was or something? I think I'm confusing.\n\nFrom the rule: \"Length of snake +1\" when eating positive food.\n\nAnd snake positions are given as a list from head to tail.\n\nInitially, snake positions: [(3,2)] so only head.\n\nIf I move to (2,2) and eat food, then new positions: head is now (2,2), and since I ate, I add a segment, so the body should be the previous head position, so positions become [(2,2), (3,2)].\n\nThen on next move, if I move, say, left to (1,2), then head to (1,2), and the tail (3,2) moves to the previous body position? No, the body segments follow: the segment that was at (3,2) moves to where the head was, but since head moved to (1,2), the body segment at (3,2) would move to (2,2), but (2,2) is now the head position? Messy.\n\nBetter to think of the positions list.\n\nBefore move: positions [A] where A=(3,2)\n\nMove head to new position B. If B has food, then new positions [B, A] (since grew by one).\n\nIf no food, new positions [B] but since length was 1, moving to empty cell, it should still be length 1, so [B].\n\nThen next move from [B], etc.\n\nSimilarly, if from [B,A], head moves to C. If C has food, new positions [C, B, A], else [C, B] and A is removed.\n\nSo in this case, from (3,2), move to (2,2) with food: new positions [(2,2), (3,2)]\n\nThen from there, head at (2,2), I can move.\n\nNow, possible moves from (2,2): U, D, L, R, but current direction: after moving left, the new direction is Left, so I cannot move Right (opposite).\n\nLet's keep track of direction.\n\nAt turn 1, head at (3,2), direction Down.\n\nI move, say, Left to (2,2). After moving, head is at (2,2), and the direction is now Left, because I moved left.\n\nSimilarly, if I move Down, direction becomes Down, etc.\n\nNo instant reverse means I cannot move opposite to the current direction at the time of move.\n\nSo from (3,2) dir Down, I can move D, L, or R.\n\nCase 1: Move Down to (3,1)\n\n- Position: (3,1), no food, so snake still length 1, positions [(3,1)], direction Down.\n\nThen turn 2: from (3,1), dir Down.\n\nPossible moves: Down to (3,0), but y=0 is wall, so invalid, collision.\n\nLeft to (2,1)\n\nRight to (4,1)\n\nUp to (3,2), but Up is opposite to current Down, so cannot, reverse forbidden.\n\nSo allowed: Left to (2,1), Right to (4,1)\n\nNow, (2,1) and (4,1) are empty, no food.\n\nBut food at (4,3) and (3,5), etc.\n\nIf I go to (3,1), I'm near the bottom, y=1, and below is wall, so I have to go left or right.\n\nBut from (3,1), moving left or right doesn't get me directly to food.\n\nFood at (2,2) is at (2,2), which is above and left of (3,1)? (3,1) to (2,2) would be left and up, but not adjacent directly; I need to move to (2,1) or (3,2) first, but (3,2) is previous position, but now empty.\n\nNot efficient.\n\nSimilarly, moving right to (4,1), then I can go to (4,2), etc.\n\nBut there's food at (4,3).\n\nBut let's not dive deep yet.\n\nCase 2: Move Left to (2,2) and eat food.\n\nSo at turn 1, move L to (2,2), eat food, value +1, snake now length 2, positions [(2,2), (3,2)], direction now Left (since moved left).\n\nNow turn 2: from (2,2), dir Left.\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L, R but cannot move Right (opposite to Left).\n\nAlso, cannot move to body: body is at (3,2), which is to the right, so moving right would go to (3,2), which is occupied by body, so collision.\n\nPositions: head at (2,2), body at (3,2).\n\nIf I move right to (3,2), it's the body segment, so head touches body, collision, dead.\n\nSimilarly, moving up to (2,3), down to (2,1), left to (1,2), those might be free.\n\n(2,3): y=3, not wall, no obstacle? Internal obstacles: (1,4), (2,4), (4,4), (5,6), (6,3). (2,3) not listed, so should be free.\n\nSimilarly, (2,1): y=1, not border wall, no obstacle, free.\n\n(1,2): x=1,y=2, not border, obstacles at (1,4) but (1,2) different, so free.\n\nSo from (2,2), with dir Left, I can move U to (2,3), D to (2,1), L to (1,2). Cannot move R to (3,2) body.\n\nNow, if I move, say, U to (2,3), no food there, I think. Food at (3,5), (4,3), etc., not at (2,3).\n\nSo move to (2,3), no eat, snake moves: head to (2,3), tail moves to (2,2)? Positions: before move [(2,2), (3,2)]\n\nHead moves to (2,3), no food, so new positions: head at (2,3), and body at (2,2), since tail advances to previous body position. So [(2,3), (2,2)]\n\nThen direction now Up.\n\nSimilarly, if move D to (2,1), new positions [(2,1), (2,2)] if no food, dir Down.\n\nOr move L to (1,2), new positions [(1,2), (2,2)] if no food, dir Left.\n\nNow, at (2,2), there is no food, because I ate it at turn 1, so it's gone? Food life span, but I ate it, so it should be removed.\n\nFood positions are given, and when eaten, they disappear.\n\nBut in this case, after eating at turn 1, food at (2,2) is gone.\n\nOther food still there.\n\nCase 3: Move Right to (4,2) at turn 1.\n\nFrom (3,2), move R to (4,2), no food there, so snake still length 1, positions [(4,2)], direction Right.\n\nThen turn 2: from (4,2), dir Right, can move U, D, R, cannot L (opposite).\n\nU to (4,3): (4,3) has food! Value +1, life span 9.\n\nD to (4,1)\n\nR to (5,2)\n\nL not allowed.\n\n(4,3) has food, so if I go U, I eat it.\n\nNow, back to turn 1 choices.\n\nI need to think which move is better for long-term.\n\nAlso, there's a food at (3,5), which is north, and (6,4) east.\n\nBut let's plan ahead.\n\nFirst, if I move Left to (2,2) at turn 1, I eat immediately, score +1, snake length 2.\n\nThen at turn 2, I need to move from (2,2) with body at (3,2).\n\nAs above, I can go U, D, or L.\n\nIf I go U to (2,3), then positions [(2,3), (2,2)], dir Up.\n\nThen from (2,3), I can go U to (2,4), but (2,4) is an internal obstacle! Walls include (2,4), so cannot go there.\n\nInternal obstacles: (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (5,6), (6,3). (2,4) is wall.\n\nSo from (2,3), if I go U to (2,4), wall, collision.\n\nD to (2,2), but (2,2) is now body position? Positions: head at (2,3), body at (2,2). If I move down to (2,2), it's the body, collision.\n\nL to (1,3), or R to (3,3).\n\n(1,3) and (3,3) should be free, no walls.\n\n(1,3): x=1,y=3, not border, obstacles: (1,4) but y=3 different, so free.\n\nSimilarly (3,3).\n\nAnd dir after moving U to (2,3) is Up, so from (2,3) dir Up, can move U, D, L, R but cannot D (opposite), and U to (2,4) wall, so only L to (1,3) or R to (3,3).\n\nIf I go R to (3,3), for example.\n\nBut let's not get too deep.\n\nFrom turn 2 at (2,2) after eating, if I go D to (2,1), then positions [(2,1), (2,2)], dir Down.\n\nThen from (2,1), I can go L to (1,1), D to (2,0) but y=0 wall, or R to (3,1), U to (2,2) but (2,2) is body, collision if I go up.\n\nSo possible L or R.\n\nSimilarly, if I go L from (2,2) to (1,2), positions [(1,2), (2,2)], dir Left.\n\nThen from (1,2), I can go U to (1,3), D to (1,1), L to (0,2) but x=0 wall, so cannot, or R to (2,2) body, collision. So possible U or D.\n\nU to (1,3) or D to (1,1).\n\n(1,3) is free, (1,1) free.\n\nNow, food at (3,5) is at y=5, which is up, and (4,3) at (4,3), (6,4) at (6,4).\n\nSince I'm at (2,2) after turn 1, going to (1,2) or (2,1) might not be towards food.\n\nIf I had moved right at turn 1 to (4,2), then at turn 2 I can go up to (4,3) and eat the food there.\n\n(4,3) has food, value 1.\n\nSo move to (4,3), eat, snake grows to length 2, positions [(4,3), (4,2)]? From (4,2) move U to (4,3), eat, so new positions [(4,3), (4,2)].\n\nThen direction Up.\n\nNow, compare: if I move left at turn 1, I eat (2,2) immediately, but then I'm at (2,2) with body at (3,2), which blocks my right move, and I'm near the left edge.\n\nIf I move right at turn 1 to (4,2), no eat, but then I can eat (4,3) at turn 2.\n\nDown at turn 1 to (3,1) seems worse, as it's cornered.\n\nBut let's think about the food at (3,5). It's at (3,5), which is up from start.\n\nFrom (3,2), moving up is forbidden since current dir down.\n\nBut I can move left or right, then up later.\n\nFor example, if I move left to (2,2), eat, then I can move up to (2,3), but from (2,2) I can move U to (2,3), as above.\n\nThen from (2,3), I can move R to (3,3) or L to (1,3).\n\nSay to (3,3), then from (3,3), I can move U to (3,4), etc., towards (3,5).\n\nSimilarly, from (4,2) after moving right, then U to (4,3) eat, then from (4,3) I can move U to (4,4), but (4,4) is wall! Internal obstacle at (4,4), so cannot.\n\nSo from (4,3), positions [(4,3), (4,2)], dir Up.\n\nMove U to (4,4) wall, collision.\n\nMove D to (4,2) but (4,2) is body, collision.\n\nMove L to (3,3) or R to (5,3).\n\n(5,3) might be ok, but obstacles: (5,6) and (6,3), (5,3) not listed, so free.\n\n(3,3) free.\n\nSo I can move L to (3,3) or R to (5,3).\n\nThen from there.\n\nBut (3,5) is at (3,5), so from (3,3) I can go U to (3,4), then to (3,5) if possible.\n\n(3,4) is not wall? Internal obstacles: (1,4), (2,4), (4,4), so (3,4) is free? Let's see: obstacles are (1,4), (2,4), (4,4), so (3,4) is not listed, so should be free.\n\ny=4, x=3.\n\nSimilarly, (3,5) no obstacle.\n\nBut (2,4) is wall, (4,4) wall, so (3,4) is free.\n\nThen (3,5) free.\n\nSimilarly, (6,4) food at (6,4).\n\nNow, also, after eating (4,3), I'm at (4,3), and (4,4) wall, so I cannot go up, must go left or right.\n\nIf I go left to (3,3), then I can go up to (3,4), then to (3,5).\n\nIf I go right to (5,3), then from (5,3), I can go U to (5,4), etc.\n\nBut (6,4) is food at (6,4), so from (5,3) I can go R to (6,3), but (6,3) is internal obstacle! Walls include (6,3), so cannot go to (6,3).\n\n(6,3) is wall, so from (5,3), I cannot go R to (6,3) wall.\n\nU to (5,4), D to (5,2), L to (4,3) but (4,3) is body if I just left, etc.\n\nLet's not complicate.\n\nPerhaps moving to eat (2,2) first is not bad, but let's see the \"Tail Reward Danger\" rule.\n\nThe rule says: \"If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because head and newly grown tail collide.\"\n\nBut in this case, at turn 1, snake has only head, no tail. So when I eat (2,2), there is no tail, so no issue. The food is at (2,2), not under tail or anything.\n\nThe rule about food under body: but here, at (2,2), it's free, not under snake.\n\nSo eating (2,2) is fine.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, to maximize score, I should plan to eat multiple foods.\n\nFoods: (2,2), (4,3), (3,5), (6,4)\n\n(2,2) is close, (4,3) is also close if I go right.\n\n(3,5) is north, (6,4) east.\n\nAlso, life spans are long, so no urgency.\n\nBut I need to avoid dead ends.\n\nFor example, if I go down to (3,1), I might get stuck near bottom.\n\nMoving left to (2,2) eats immediately, but then I'm near left with body at (3,2), so I have to go up or down.\n\nMoving right to (4,2) doesn't eat, but allows me to eat (4,3) next.\n\nLet's simulate a few turns for each option.\n\nOption A: Turn 1 move L to (2,2), eat, score +1, snake [(2,2), (3,2)], dir Left.\n\nTurn 2: from (2,2), cannot R, so move U to (2,3) (assume), no food, positions [(2,3), (2,2)], dir Up.\n\nTurn 3: from (2,3), dir Up, cannot D, U to (2,4) wall, so move L to (1,3) or R to (3,3).\n\nSay move R to (3,3), no food, positions [(3,3), (2,3)], dir Right? Moved from (2,3) to (3,3), which is right, so dir Right.\n\nTurn 4: from (3,3), dir Right, can move U to (3,4), D to (3,2), L to (2,3) but (2,3) is body, R to (4,3) but (4,3) has food, but let's see.\n\nPositions: head (3,3), body (2,3). (2,3) is at left, (3,2) is below.\n\nMove U to (3,4): (3,4) is free, no food, so positions [(3,4), (3,3)], dir Up.\n\nThen turn 5: from (3,4), dir Up, can move U to (3,5) which has food! So move U, eat (3,5), score +1, snake grows to [(3,5), (3,4), (3,3)], length 3.\n\nThen continue.\n\nBut at turn 4, I could have moved directly to (4,3) from (3,3) by moving right, but (4,3) has food, so if I move R to (4,3), I eat it, score +1, positions [(4,3), (3,3)], but (3,3) was head, now body.\n\nThen from there, as before, I can go left or right, since up is wall.\n\nBut (3,5) is still there.\n\nIn this path, I ate (2,2) and then (3,5), score 2 by turn 5.\n\nOption B: Turn 1 move R to (4,2), no eat, positions [(4,2)], dir Right.\n\nTurn 2: move U to (4,3), eat, score +1, positions [(4,3), (4,2)], dir Up.\n\nTurn 3: from (4,3), dir Up, cannot D, U to (4,4) wall, so move L to (3,3) or R to (5,3).\n\nSay move L to (3,3), no food, positions [(3,3), (4,3)], dir Left.\n\nTurn 4: from (3,3), dir Left, can move U to (3,4), D to (3,2), L to (2,3), R to (4,3) but (4,3) is body, collision if R.\n\nSo U, D, or L.\n\nMove U to (3,4), no food, positions [(3,4), (3,3)], dir Up.\n\nTurn 5: move U to (3,5), eat, score +1, positions [(3,5), (3,4), (3,3)].\n\nScore 2 by turn 5, same as option A.\n\nIf at turn 3 from (4,3) I move R to (5,3), then positions [(5,3), (4,3)], dir Right.\n\nThen turn 4: from (5,3), dir Right, can move U to (5,4), D to (5,2), L to (4,3) body, R to (6,3) wall (since (6,3) obstacle), so only U or D.\n\nMove U to (5,4), no food, positions [(5,4), (5,3)], dir Up.\n\nThen turn 5: from (5,4), can move U to (5,5), D to (5,3) body, L to (4,4) wall, R to (6,4) but (6,4) has food, and (6,4) is not wall? (6,4) is food position, not listed as wall, so free.\n\nBut obstacles: (6,3) is wall, but (6,4) different y, so should be free.\n\nx=6, y=4, border walls x=0,x=7,y=0,y=7, so x=6 not border, y=4 not border, internal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3). (6,3) is wall, but (6,4) not listed, so free.\n\nSo from (5,4), move R to (6,4), eat food, score +1, positions [(6,4), (5,4), (5,3)].\n\nBut at turn 5, I ate (6,4), and previously ate (4,3), so score 2 by turn 5.\n\nIn option A, I ate (2,2) and (3,5).\n\nAll good.\n\nBut in turn 1, moving down to (3,1) is worse.\n\nTurn 1 move D to (3,1), positions [(3,1)], dir Down.\n\nTurn 2: from (3,1), dir Down, cannot U, D to (3,0) wall, so move L to (2,1) or R to (4,1).\n\nSay move L to (2,1), no food, positions [(2,1)], dir Left.\n\nThen need to go up to (2,2) but (2,2) had food, but if I didn't eat it, it might be there, but at turn 2, food at (2,2) is still there since life span 9, turn 1 to 2.\n\nBut from (2,1), I can move U to (2,2), which has food, so eat, score +1, positions [(2,2), (2,1)], dir Up? Moved up from (2,1) to (2,2), so dir Up.\n\nBut this is later, and I missed the opportunity to eat (4,3) or something.\n\nBut I can still eat (2,2) at turn 3 or so, but delayed.\n\nSimilarly, (3,5) might be eaten later, but not efficient.\n\nSo moving down first is suboptimal.\n\nNow, between moving left or right at turn 1.\n\nMoving left eats immediately, moving right allows eating (4,3) next turn.\n\nBut both lead to score 2 by turn 5.\n\nBut I need to think beyond turn 5 for long-term.\n\nAlso, there is food at (6,4), which I can eat in option B by going right.\n\nIn option A, after eating (3,5), I can go towards (6,4).\n\nBut let's see the grid with obstacles.\n\nInternal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3)\n\n(2,4) and (4,4) walls, so row y=4 has walls at x=1,2,4, so gaps at x=3,5,6,7? x=3,5,6.\n\nx=3,y=4 free, x=5,y=4 free, x=6,y=4 free, x=7,y=4 but x=7 border wall, so not free.\n\nSimilarly, (6,3) wall, so (6,4) is free but surrounded? (6,4) has food.\n\nTo reach (6,4), from left, I need to go through (5,4) or (6,5) etc.\n\nBut (6,3) below is wall, so from (6,4), I can go up, down, left, right except down to (6,3) wall.\n\nBut not an issue now.\n\nBack to turn 1 decision.\n\nPerhaps moving right to (4,2) then to (4,3) is better because (4,3) is closer to other foods like (6,4) or (3,5).\n\n(3,5) is at (3,5), from (4,3) I can go to (3,3) then (3,4) then (3,5).\n\nSimilarly, from (2,2) I can also go to (3,3) etc.\n\nBut after eating (4,3), I am at (4,3), and (4,4) wall, so I have to move left or right, then up.\n\nWhereas after eating (2,2), I can move directly up towards (3,5).\n\nBut (3,5) is at y=5, x=3.\n\nAlso, the food at (6,4) has life span 10, so I have time.\n\nBut to maximize, I should eat as many as possible.\n\nAnother thing: the snake is short, so no body collision issues yet.\n\nBut later, when longer, need to avoid self-collision.\n\nFor now, all options seem ok.\n\nBut let's consider the \"Tail Reward Danger\" for future, but not applicable now.\n\nAlso, food can spawn under body, but here no food under body.\n\nIn this state, all food is on free cells.\n\nNow, I need to output actions for multiple turns, at least 5 turns ahead? The answer format is to list actions for turns starting from t1.\n\nIt says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but the output should be a sequence of actions for several turns.\n\nThe answer format: \\boxed{ Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ... }\n\nAnd it should be for how many turns? It doesn't specify, but since it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", I should plan for at least 5 turns.\n\nBut the sequence can be for as many as I want, but to be practical, I'll plan 5 turns.\n\nStart from turn 1.\n\nCurrent head (3,2) dir D.\n\nI think moving right to (4,2) then up to (4,3) to eat is a good start, as it positions me to go towards (3,5) or (6,4).\n\nSimilarly, moving left to eat (2,2) is also good, but then I'm on the left side.\n\nBut the grid has obstacles on the left, like (1,4), (2,4) walls.\n\nFor example, from (2,2) after eating, if I go up to (2,3), then I can go to (3,3), then to (3,4), (3,5), all free.\n\nFrom (4,3) after eating, I can go to (3,3), then same path.\n\nBut from (4,3), I can also go to (5,3) then to (5,4), then to (6,4), which might be faster for (6,4).\n\n(6,4) is at (6,4), from (4,3) to (5,3) to (5,4) to (6,4), three moves if I eat on the way.\n\nFrom (4,3) to (5,3) no eat, then to (5,4) no eat, then to (6,4) eat.\n\nOr from (4,3) I can go directly to (3,3) then up.\n\nBut (3,5) is at (3,5), from (3,3) to (3,4) to (3,5), two moves to eat.\n\nSimilarly, from (4,3) to (3,3) to (3,4) to (3,5), three moves including to (3,3) no eat.\n\nBut in terms of distance, both foods are reachable.\n\nSince I need to think long-term survival, the bottom area near y=1 might be riskier with walls.\n\nFor example, if I go down, I might get trapped.\n\nBut in the upper area, more space.\n\nAlso, with obstacles, the left has (1,4) and (2,4) walls, so around (1,2) to (1,3) might be ok, but limited space.\n\nRight side has (6,3) wall, but (6,4) free, and (5,6) high up.\n\nSo perhaps the center and right are better.\n\nTherefore, moving right at turn 1 might be better to access (4,3) and then (6,4) or (3,5).\n\nI can go for (3,5) first since it's closer to x=3.\n\nLet's decide on a sequence.\n\nTurn 1: from (3,2) dir D, move R to (4,2), no eat, snake still [(4,2)], dir R.\n\nTurn 2: from (4,2) dir R, move U to (4,3), eat food, score +1, snake [(4,3), (4,2)], dir U.\n\nTurn 3: from (4,3) dir U, cannot D, U to (4,4) wall, so move L to (3,3) or R to (5,3).\n\nNow, to go towards (3,5), move L to (3,3), no food, positions [(3,3), (4,3)], dir L (since left from (4,3) to (3,3)).\n\nTurn 4: from (3,3) dir L, can move U to (3,4), D to (3,2), L to (2,3), R to (4,3) body.\n\n(3,4) is free, so move U to (3,4), no food, positions [(3,4), (3,3)], dir U.\n\nTurn 5: from (3,4) dir U, move U to (3,5), eat food, score +1, snake [(3,5), (3,4), (3,3)], dir U.\n\nThen I can continue, but for the sequence, up to turn 5.\n\nActions: turn 1 R, turn 2 U, turn 3 L, turn 4 U, turn 5 U.\n\nIn turn 3, I moved L to (3,3), but I could have moved R to (5,3) to go towards (6,4).\n\nBut (3,5) is closer in this path.\n\nFrom turn 3 at (4,3), if I move R to (5,3), no food, positions [(5,3), (4,3)], dir R.\n\nTurn 4: from (5,3) dir R, can move U to (5,4), D to (5,2), L to (4,3) body, R to (6,3) wall, so move U to (5,4) or D to (5,2).\n\nMove U to (5,4), no food, positions [(5,4), (5,3)], dir U.\n\nTurn 5: from (5,4) dir U, can move U to (5,5), D to (5,3) body, L to (4,4) wall, R to (6,4) which has food, so move R to (6,4), eat, score +1, positions [(6,4), (5,4), (5,3)], dir R.\n\nSo in this case, I ate (4,3) at turn 2 and (6,4) at turn 5, score 2.\n\nSimilarly good.\n\nBut in the first sub-option, I ate (3,5) at turn 5.\n\nNow, for long-term, after eating (3,5), I have a snake of length 3 at (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), and I can move to other areas.\n\nSimilarly, after (6,4), I can go to other foods.\n\nBut there might be more food later, but for now, only these four.\n\nI need to consider if all foods are eaten or not.\n\nBut to start, I think moving right is fine.\n\nIf I move left at turn 1, eat (2,2), then turn 2 move U to (2,3), turn 3 move R to (3,3), turn 4 U to (3,4), turn 5 U to (3,5) eat, same as before but ate (2,2) earlier.\n\nIn that case, at turn 1 ate (2,2), turn 5 ate (3,5), score 2.\n\nSimilar.\n\nBut in the right move, I ate (4,3) at turn 2.\n\nNo big difference.\n\nHowever, by moving right, I avoid the left side which has obstacles at y=4, like (1,4) and (2,4), so the path to (3,5) might be clearer from the right.\n\nBut from left, I can go through (3,3) etc., same.\n\nI think both are ok, but let's choose one.\n\nSince the head direction is down, and moving right is perpendicular, it might be better for exploration.\n\nAlso, the food at (6,4) has life span 10, while others 9, but all long, so no issue.\n\nI'll go with moving right first.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 1: Move R to (4,2)\n\nTurn 2: Move U to (4,3) and eat\n\nNow turn 3: from (4,3) dir U, move L to (3,3) to go towards (3,5)\n\nOr move R to (5,3) to go towards (6,4)\n\n(3,5) has life span 9, so it disappears after turn 9, we are at turn 3, so 6 turns left, plenty.\n\nSimilarly (6,4) life span 10, disappears after turn 10.\n\nBut to eat both, I need a path.\n\nFrom (4,3), moving left to (3,3) then up to (3,4), (3,5) is efficient.\n\nIf I go right to (5,3), then to (5,4), (6,4), I eat (6,4) but (3,5) might not be eaten if I don't go back.\n\nBut I can eat (3,5) later if time, but it might be risky to leave it.\n\nSince (3,5) is at (3,5), and (6,4) at (6,4), I can eat (3,5) first since it's closer to current position at turn 3.\n\nAt turn 3, after eating (4,3), I am at (4,3).\n\n(3,5) is at (3,5), which is distance |dx|=1, |dy|=2, so Manhattan distance 3.\n\n(6,4) is at (6,4), |dx|=2, |dy|=1, distance 3.\n\nSame distance.\n\nBut to eat (3,5), I can go to (3,3) then (3,4) then (3,5), but (3,3) is at (3,3), from (4,3) to (3,3) is one move left, then to (3,4) up, then to (3,5) up, so two moves to reach (3,5) from (4,3): first to (3,3) no eat, then to (3,4) no eat, then to (3,5) eat on third move.\n\nSimilarly, to (6,4): from (4,3) to (5,3) no eat, to (5,4) no eat, to (6,4) eat, also three moves.\n\nBut (3,5) has life span 9, disappears after turn 9. At turn 3, I have until turn 9 to eat, so 6 turns, ok.\n\nSimilarly for (6,4).\n\nBut if I go to (3,5) first, I can then go to (6,4) later.\n\nAfter eating (3,5), I am at (3,5) with body at (3,4) and (3,3), so I can move right to (4,5) or something, then to (5,5), (6,4), but (6,4) is at y=4, so I need to go down.\n\nFor example, from (3,5) move R to (4,5), then to (5,5), then to (6,5), then down to (6,4), but (6,4) is food, so I can go directly if possible.\n\nFrom (3,5), positions [(3,5), (3,4), (3,3)], dir U (since last move up).\n\nCan move U, D, L, R but cannot D (opposite), L to (2,5), R to (4,5), U to (3,6).\n\n(3,6) y=6, not wall, obstacles: (5,6) but (3,6) free? (5,6) is obstacle, but (3,6) different, so free.\n\nBut to go to (6,4), moving right to (4,5), then (5,5), then (6,5), then D to (6,4), but (6,4) has food, so when I move to it, I eat.\n\nBut from (6,5) to (6,4) down.\n\nBut (6,5) is at y=5, x=6.\n\nFirst, from (3,5) to (4,5) to (5,5) to (6,5) to (6,4), four moves, and eat at (6,4).\n\nBut life span 10, so if I eat at turn 5 (3,5), then turn 6 to (4,5), turn 7 to (5,5), turn 8 to (6,5), turn 9 to (6,4) eat, before turn 10, ok.\n\nIf I eat (6,4) first, then go to (3,5), from (6,4) to (6,5) to (5,5) to (4,5) to (3,5), but (3,5) might disappear at turn 9, and if I start from turn 5 at (6,4), turn 6 to (6,5), turn 7 to (5,5), turn 8 to (4,5), turn 9 to (3,5) eat, just in time.\n\nBut (3,5) disappears after turn 9, meaning if I move to it on turn 9, I can eat before it disappears? Life span decreases every turn, including current.\n\nLife span: at turn when food appears, life span N, decreases each turn, when life span 0, disappears.\n\nIn state, food at turn 1: (3,5) life span 9, so it will disappear after 9 turns, meaning on turn 10 it's gone? Let's see.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n\nSo at turn t, for a food with life span L, after turn t, L decreases by 1, and when L=0, it disappears before the next turn.\n\nExample: food at turn 1 with life span 9. After turn 1, life span 8. After turn 2, 7, ..., after turn 9, life span 0, disappears, so not available on turn 10.\n\nTo eat it, I must move to it on or before turn 9.\n\nSimilarly, (6,4) life span 10, disappear after turn 10, so eat by turn 10.\n\nNow, back to sequence.\n\nIn my earlier plan, if I go to (3,5) first, I eat at turn 5, then can go to (6,4) by turn 9.\n\nSimilarly, if I go to (6,4) first, eat by turn 5 or 6, then to (3,5) by turn 9.\n\nBut since both are possible, I'll stick with going to (3,5) first.\n\nSo for the action sequence:\n\nTurn 1: Move R (from (3,2) to (4,2))\n\nTurn 2: Move U (to (4,3) and eat)\n\nTurn 3: Move L (to (3,3))\n\nTurn 4: Move U (to (3,4))\n\nTurn 5: Move U (to (3,5) and eat)\n\nThen beyond, but for the answer, I need to output these turns.\n\nThe current turn is t1=1, so output for turn 1 to, say, turn 5.\n\nI could include turn 6, but 5 turns ahead means from turn 1 to turn 6? Think 5+ turns ahead, but output the actions.\n\nThe answer format should list actions starting from turn 1.\n\nAnd since it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", I should output at least 5 actions, for turn 1 to turn 5 or more.\n\nIn the format, it shows \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" so I can do for multiple turns.\n\nBut to be safe, I'll output for 5 turns: turn 1 to turn 5.\n\nIn turn 5, I eat (3,5), so good.\n\nIf I want to eat (6,4) as well, I need more turns, but for the sequence, I can stop at turn 5.\n\nNow, in turn 3, I moved L to (3,3), but is there a reason to move R instead? Not necessary.\n\nAlso, need to avoid risks.\n\nFor example, at turn 4, from (3,3) to (3,4), (3,4) is free.\n\nThen to (3,5).\n\nNo immediate risks.\n\nIf I had moved differently, but this seems fine.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 1: R\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: L\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nNow, in the output, it should be in the boxed format.\n\nAlso, directions: U, D, L, R.\n\nNow, about the food at (2,2): if I don't eat it, it will be there, but I can eat it later if possible, but in this path, I didn't go to it, so it might expire, but life span 9, so by turn 9 or 10, but I might not reach it.\n\nBut since I'm going to (3,5) and (6,4), (2,2) is out of way, so I might not eat it, but it's ok, I can eat others.\n\nTo maximize, I should eat all, but it might not be efficient with obstacles.\n\nFor example, to eat (2,2) from current, I need to go left, but I chose right, so it might be left uneaten, but that's fine.\n\nSimilarly, in the left path, I eat (2,2) but might not eat (6,4) easily.\n\nSo I think moving right is better for overall access.\n\nTherefore, I'll go with this sequence.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while prioritizing long-term survival, I will plan a sequence of moves for at least 5 turns ahead. The current state (turn 1) has the snake head at (3,2) moving down. Key goals are to eat positive food (all available food has value +1) and avoid collisions with walls, obstacles, or the snake's body. The grid has borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and internal obstacles at (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), and (6,3). Food locations are (3,5), (2,2), (4,3), and (6,4), all with sufficient life spans (9 or 10 turns), so there is no immediate urgency.\n\n### Strategy for Turn 1 to Turn 5:\n- **Immediate move (Turn 1)**: From (3,2) with direction down, moving right (R) to (4,2) avoids the reverse move (up is forbidden) and positions the snake to eat the food at (4,3) on the next turn. Moving left to eat (2,2) is possible but places the snake near the left edge with obstacles (e.g., (1,4) and (2,4)), limiting future mobility. Moving down to (3,1) risks cornering the snake near the bottom wall (y=0). Thus, right is optimal for accessing central and right-side food.\n- **Turn 2**: From (4,2) with direction right, move up (U) to (4,3) to eat the food there (+1 score, snake length 2). This is safe and efficient, as (4,3) is adjacent and free.\n- **Turn 3**: From (4,3) with direction up, move left (L) to (3,3). Moving up to (4,4) is blocked by a wall, and moving right to (5,3) would delay access to (3,5). Moving left to (3,3) starts a path toward (3,5), which is closer than (6,4) and must be eaten by turn 9.\n- **Turn 4**: From (3,3) with direction left (from the previous move), move up (U) to (3,4). This continues toward (3,5) and avoids risks (e.g., down to (3,2) is safe but less efficient, left to (2,3) or right to (4,3) may lead to dead ends or collisions later).\n- **Turn 5**: From (3,4) with direction up, move up (U) to (3,5) to eat the food (+1 score, snake length 3). This achieves a second food eat by turn 5 and positions the snake for further exploration (e.g., toward (6,4)).\n\n### Long-term Considerations (Beyond Turn 5):\n- By turn 5, the snake has eaten two foods (at (4,3) and (3,5)) for a score of 2, with positions [(3,5), (3,4), (3,3)] and direction up. Next moves could target (6,4) (e.g., via (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), then down to (6,4) by turn 9) or other foods if spawned. (2,2) may be skipped due to inefficiency, but its life span (disappears after turn 9) allows flexibility.\n- Risks are minimized: no body collisions (snake is short), and the path avoids walls and obstacles. After turn 5, prioritize open areas (e.g., right side) for survival.\n\n### Action Sequence:\nThe sequence for turns 1 to 5 is as follows:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 1: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 2: U (up) \\\\\nTurn 3: L (left) \\\\\nTurn 4: U (up) \\\\\nTurn 5: U (up)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 2, and the snake is at position (4,2) with direction right. Since it's a single segment, it's just the head, no body yet. That means when it eats food, it will grow.\n\nThe walls are defined: border cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7). Internal obstacles are at (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3).\n\nFood positions:\n\n- (3,5) with life span 8, value +1 (positive food)\n\n- (2,2) with life span 8, value +1\n\n- (4,3) with life span 8, value +1\n\n- (6,4) with life span 9, value +1\n\nAll food is positive, no negative food mentioned. Life span is given, and for (4,3), it's at (4,3) with life 8, value 1.\n\nSnake head is at (4,2), direction right. Since it's only one segment, moving right would take it to (5,2), but I need to check if that's safe.\n\nPossible moves: U (up to (4,3)), D (down to (4,1)), L (left to (3,2)), R (right to (5,2)).\n\nBut current direction is R, so I can't instantly reverse to L. Since it's moving right, opposite would be left, so L is not allowed next turn. But since there's no body, reverse might not be an issue, but the rule says \"no instant reverse\", so from direction R, I cannot choose L on the next turn.\n\nAlso, walls: borders are deadly, so x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. Internal obstacles at (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3).\n\nNow, (4,3) has food, and it's directly above the head at (4,2). So moving U to (4,3) would eat that food immediately.\n\nBut I need to think 5+ turns ahead and prioritize long-term survival.\n\nFirst, let's list the grid:\n\nLet me sketch a grid. Rows y from 0 to 7, columns x from 0 to 7.\n\ny=0 bottom, y=7 top? Typically in such grids, y=0 might be top or bottom, but since directions are given, U is (x,y+1), so increasing y is up, so probably y=0 is bottom, y=7 top? Let's confirm.\n\nThe head is at (4,2), and U would be to (4,3), which is up, so higher y is north/up. So y=0 is south, y=7 north? In coordinates, often (0,0) is bottom-left or top-left. But in this case, since U is (x,y+1), that means y increases upward, so (0,0) is bottom-left, (7,7) top-right? x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nBorder walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So if y=0 is bottom, then y=0 is south wall, y=7 north wall, x=0 west, x=7 east.\n\nInternal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3)\n\nFood: (3,5), (2,2), (4,3), (6,4)\n\nSnake: head at (4,2), direction R.\n\nSince snake has only one segment, no body to collide with. Also, tail is the same as head, so no issue with tail reward danger.\n\nIf I eat food, snake grows to two segments.\n\nNow, possible moves:\n\n- U: to (4,3) - this has food, so I eat it, snake grows to length 2, new position head at (4,3), tail at (4,2) or something? When snake moves, if it eats, the tail doesn't move, so after eating, snake becomes [(4,3), (4,2)] with head at (4,3), and direction would be U.\n\nBut let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, on turn 2, I need to choose action for turn 2.\n\nThen for future turns, but I need to output actions for multiple turns, but only up to 5 or so, but the answer format says to output for turn t1, t1+1, etc., but it doesn't specify how many. I think I need to plan a sequence for at least 5 turns or until a decision point.\n\nBut since the state changes, I need to simulate based on actions.\n\nThe instruction is to think 5+ turns ahead and output the actions for the current and next few turns.\n\nAlso, food life span decreases each turn.\n\nCurrent turn t1=2.\n\nFood life spans: all have 8 or 9, so (3,5) life 8, (2,2) life 8, (4,3) life 8, (6,4) life 9. Since life span decreases every turn including current, after turn 2, all life spans decrease by 1? Life span is the number of turns it remains, including the current turn? Let's see the rule.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n\nSo for food at turn t with life span L, it will disappear after t + L - 1 turns or something? Let's clarify.\n\n\"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" so at turn t, if life span is L, then at turn t, countdown is L, at turn t+1, it becomes L-1, and so on, until 0, then disappears.\n\nFor example, at turn 2, food has life span 8, so it will be there for 8 turns starting from turn 2, so it disappears after turn 9? Countdown decreases every turn including current.\n\nAt the beginning of turn t, food is present with countdown C. After the turn, C decreases by 1. When C=0, it disappears after that turn.\n\nRule: \"Disappears after N turns\" meaning after N turns from now.\n\n\"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" – I think it's a bit ambiguous.\n\nLet's read carefully: \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n\nI think it means that when food is spawned, it has a life span N, and for each turn, including the turn it is spawned, the countdown decreases. So after N turns, it disappears.\n\nFor example, if at turn T, food is present with life span L, then on turn T, countdown is L; on turn T+1, countdown is L-1; ... on turn T+L-1, countdown is 1; after turn T+L-1, it disappears, so not present on turn T+L.\n\nIn this case, all food is given at turn 2 with life span 8 or 9, so for (3,5): life span 8, so it will be present from turn 2 to turn 9 (countdown from 8 to 1), disappears after turn 9.\n\nSimilarly, (2,2) life 8, same.\n\n(4,3) life 8, same.\n\n(6,4) life 9, so from turn 2 to 10 (countdown 9 to 1), disappears after turn 10.\n\nNow, back to actions.\n\nCurrent position: head at (4,2), direction R.\n\nPossible actions: U, D, L, R.\n\nBut no instant reverse: current direction R, so cannot go L (left).\n\nSo allowed moves: U (up), D (down), R (right).\n\nL is not allowed.\n\nNow, check each move:\n\n- R: to (5,2). Is this safe? (5,2) is within bounds? x=5, y=2, x from 0-7, y from 0-7, so yes. Walls: border only at edges, internal obstacles at (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3), none at (5,2), so safe. No food there, so no eat, snake stays length 1.\n\n- U: to (4,3). (4,3) has food, so eat it, snake grows to length 2. Position: head moves to (4,3), tail remains at (4,2) for now? When snake moves and eats, the head moves to new cell, and if it eats, the tail doesn't move, so snake grows. So after moving U and eating, snake positions: [(4,3), (4,2)] with head at (4,3), direction U.\n\n- D: to (4,1). (4,1) is within bounds, no wall, no food? Food at (2,2), (3,5), (4,3), (6,4), not at (4,1), so no eat, snake still length 1, head at (4,1), direction D.\n\nNow, I need to think ahead.\n\nFirst, if I go U to (4,3), I eat food immediately, score +1, snake length 2.\n\nThen position: head at (4,3), direction U.\n\nFrom there, possible moves: U, D, L, R, but no reverse. Direction U, so cannot go D (down).\n\nCurrent direction U, so cannot instantly reverse to D.\n\nSo allowed: U (to (4,4)), L (to (3,3)), R (to (5,3)).\n\nNow, (4,4) is an internal obstacle! Walls include (4,4), so cannot go there.\n\nL to (3,3): is there wall? (3,3) not listed as wall, so safe. Food? Food at (3,5), (2,2), etc., not at (3,3), so no food.\n\nR to (5,3): (5,3) not wall? Internal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3). (6,3) is wall, but (5,3) not listed, so should be safe. Food? Not at (5,3).\n\nBut (6,3) is wall, but (5,3) is fine.\n\nNow, if I go U to (4,3), I eat, so food at (4,3) is consumed, removed.\n\nThen from (4,3), I can go U, but (4,4) is wall, dead, cannot.\n\nGo L to (3,3) or R to (5,3).\n\nSay I go L to (3,3), then head at (3,3), direction L.\n\nThen from there, possible moves, etc.\n\nBut I need to plan multiple turns.\n\nSince I must think 5+ turns ahead, I should consider different paths.\n\nFirst, what are the goals? Maximize score, so eat food, but avoid risks.\n\nCurrently, food at (4,3) is very close, but after eating, I might be in a tricky position because (4,4) is wall above.\n\nSimilarly, other food: (2,2) is below left, (3,5) up left, (6,4) up right.\n\n(2,2) is at (2,2), which is left and down from (4,2).\n\n(3,5) is up and left.\n\n(6,4) is right and up.\n\nNow, if I don't eat (4,3) now, I could go elsewhere.\n\nFor example, go R to (5,2).\n\nThen head at (5,2), direction R.\n\nThen from there, possible moves: U to (5,3), D to (5,1), L to (4,2), R to (6,2).\n\nBut direction R, so cannot reverse to L? Reverse opposite: current direction R, opposite is L, so cannot go L.\n\nSo allowed: U, D, R.\n\nNow, (5,3): is it safe? (5,3) not wall, but (6,3) is wall, but (5,3) is fine. No food.\n\n(5,1): safe, no food.\n\nR to (6,2): (6,2) within bounds? x=6,y=2, x=7 is border, but x=6 is not wall, border at x=0 and x=7, so x=6 is fine. y=2 fine. Internal walls: (6,3) is wall, but (6,2) not listed, so safe. Food? (6,4) is food, but (6,2) not.\n\nIf I go R to (6,2), then from there, I can go to (6,4) or something.\n\nBut (6,4) has food.\n\nSimilarly, I could go D to (4,1), then to (2,2) or something.\n\nBut let's think about the (4,3) food. If I don't eat it now, it might disappear later, but life span 8, so it will be there for several turns.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nBut I need to avoid dead ends.\n\nAlso, with snake growing, I need space.\n\nCurrently, grid has obstacles.\n\nList all wall cells:\n\nBorders: all x=0, x=7 for y=0 to 7; all y=0, y=7 for x=0 to 7. So cells like (0,0) to (0,7), (7,0) to (7,7), (0,0) to (7,0), (0,7) to (7,7) are walls.\n\nInternal: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3)\n\nSo wall cells: let's list coordinates to avoid.\n\nFor movement, a cell is deadly if it has wall or body.\n\nBut body only after growth.\n\nNow, back to decision.\n\nOption 1: Go U to (4,3), eat food, snake now length 2: positions [(4,3), (4,2)], head dir U.\n\nThen on next turn, from (4,3), I cannot go U to (4,4) because wall.\n\nSo only L to (3,3) or R to (5,3).\n\nSay I go L to (3,3), then head at (3,3), body at (4,3), tail at (4,2)? Positions: after moving to (3,3), if no eat, tail moves, so snake becomes [(3,3), (4,3)] since length 2, head to (3,3), tail from (4,2) to? When moving, if not eating, tail moves forward, so from [(4,3), (4,2)], move head to new position, tail removed.\n\nStandard snake: when moving, head moves to new cell, if not eating, tail is removed, so snake shortens? No, in snake game, when not eating, head moves to new cell, tail is removed, so length same. When eating, head moves to new cell (with food), tail not removed, so length increases.\n\nIn this case, after eating at (4,3), snake is [(4,3), (4,2)].\n\nNow, on next move, say I go L to (3,3). Since no food at (3,3), not eating, so head moves to (3,3), tail is removed, so snake becomes [(3,3)], only head? No: positions: from [(4,3), (4,2)], head moves to (3,3), so the body segment at (4,3) becomes the new tail or what? The segments: the head was at (4,3), it moves to (3,3), so new head at (3,3). The body segment at (4,2) is the tail. Since not eating, the tail is removed, so the snake now has only one segment at (3,3). Length back to 1?\n\nThat can't be right. I think I have a mistake.\n\nStandard snake mechanics: the snake has a body. When the head moves to a new cell:\n\n- If the cell has food, the snake grows: the head occupies the new cell, and the tail stays, so the body extends.\n\n- If no food, the head moves to new cell, and the tail end is removed, so the body moves forward, length constant.\n\nIn this case, after eating at (4,3), snake has two segments: head at (4,3), and tail at (4,2).\n\nNow, when moving to a new cell, say (3,3), which has no food, so not eating. Therefore, head moves to (3,3), and the tail is removed, so the new snake is just [(3,3)], with head at (3,3), no body. So length 1 again.\n\nBut that seems odd because we ate food to grow, but then we moved and since no food, the tail is removed, so back to length 1.\n\nBut in snake, when you eat, you grow, so the length increases permanently until you die.\n\nI think I confused myself.\n\nLet's clarify the growth mechanic.\n\nFrom the rules: \"Positive Food: Reward Value = +1 | Length of snake +1\"\n\nAnd \"when eating, the head moves onto the food cell, and the snake grows, so length increases by 1.\"\n\nThen, when moving without eating, the head moves to new cell, and the tail moves forward, so the length remains the same; only when eating, the tail doesn't move, so length increases.\n\nIn the case above: start at turn 2, snake at [(4,2)], length 1.\n\nMove U to (4,3), which has food, so eat, snake now length 2, positions: head at (4,3), and the previous position (4,2) is now the tail. So snake segments: [(4,3), (4,2)].\n\nNow, on next turn, move to (3,3). (3,3) has no food, so not eating. Therefore, head moves to (3,3), and the tail is removed, so the segment at (4,2) is removed, and the body at (4,3) becomes the new tail? No.\n\nThe snake body: the segments are ordered. After eating, segments: index 0: head at (4,3), index 1: tail at (4,2).\n\nWhen moving, the head moves to new position, here (3,3). Since no food, the tail end is removed. So the new segments are: head at (3,3), and the previous head (4,3) is now the body, and the tail (4,2) is removed. So new snake: [(3,3), (4,3)] with head at (3,3), tail at (4,3).\n\nLength still 2, but the tail moved from (4,2) to (4,3)? When head moves from (4,3) to (3,3), the body segment at (4,3) is still there, but it becomes the new tail, and the old tail at (4,2) is removed. So the new positions are: new head at (3,3), and the previous head position (4,3) is now the tail. So snake is [(3,3), (4,3)].\n\nYes, length 2, tail at (4,3).\n\nThen from there, I can move, etc.\n\nBut in this case, when I moved to (3,3), the tail was at (4,2), removed, so (4,2) is now empty.\n\nSimilarly, if I had moved to a cell with food, the tail would not be removed.\n\nBack to the decision.\n\nIf at turn 2, I move U to (4,3), eat food, snake becomes [(4,3), (4,2)], head dir U.\n\nThen turn 3, from (4,3), I can go L to (3,3) or R to (5,3), since U to (4,4) is wall, D is reverse, not allowed.\n\nSay I go L to (3,3), no food, so snake becomes [(3,3), (4,3)], head at (3,3), dir L.\n\nThen turn 4, from (3,3), possible moves: U to (3,4), D to (3,2), L to (2,3), R to (4,3) but (4,3) is now body, so collision if I go R.\n\nPositions: head at (3,3), body at (4,3), so cells occupied: (3,3) and (4,3).\n\nIf I move R to (4,3), that's where the body is, so head touches body, collision, dead.\n\nSimilarly, moving to a cell with body is deadly.\n\nSo from (3,3), I can go U, D, L, but not R.\n\nDirection is L (since last move was L to (3,3), so current direction L.\n\nCannot instantly reverse to R.\n\nSo allowed moves: U (to (3,4)), D (to (3,2)), L (to (2,3)).\n\nNow, (3,4): is it safe? No wall, not body, so ok. Food? No.\n\n(3,2): safe, no food.\n\n(2,3): safe, no food.\n\nSay I go U to (3,4), then head at (3,4), body at (3,3), tail at (4,3)? After moving, if no eat, tail removed, so from [(3,3), (4,3)], head to (3,4), not eating, so tail at (4,3) removed, new snake [(3,4), (3,3)].\n\nHead at (3,4), dir U.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBut this path might not be efficient for eating other food.\n\nIf from (4,3) I go R to (5,3) on turn 3.\n\n(5,3) is safe, no food, so snake becomes [(5,3), (4,3)], head at (5,3), dir R.\n\nThen from there, I can go to (6,3), but (6,3) is wall! Internal obstacle at (6,3), so cannot go there.\n\nOr U to (5,4), D to (5,2), L to (4,3) but (4,3) is body, collision.\n\nSo from (5,3), allowed moves: U to (5,4), D to (5,2), since direction R, cannot reverse L.\n\n(5,4) safe, (5,2) safe.\n\nBut (6,4) has food above, at (6,4).\n\nFrom (5,3), I can go U to (5,4), then to (6,4) or something.\n\nBut let's think long-term.\n\nPerhaps eating the (4,3) food now is not the best because it puts me near a wall at (4,4), limiting movement.\n\nAlternative: on turn 2, go R to (5,2).\n\nThen head at (5,2), dir R.\n\nNo eat, snake still length 1, position [(5,2)].\n\nThen turn 3, from (5,2), possible moves: U to (5,3), D to (5,1), R to (6,2).\n\nCannot go L, since dir R, opposite L not allowed.\n\n(5,3) safe, no food.\n\n(5,1) safe, no food.\n\n(6,2) safe, no food.\n\nSay I go U to (5,3), then head at (5,3), no eat, snake still [(5,3)].\n\nThen from there, I can go to (6,4) or other food.\n\n(6,4) is at (6,4), which is above and right.\n\nFrom (5,3), go R to (6,3), but (6,3) is wall, cannot.\n\nGo U to (5,4), then to (6,4).\n\n(5,4) safe? No wall, yes.\n\nFrom (5,3) go U to (5,4), no food, snake still length 1, head at (5,4).\n\nThen from (5,4), go R to (6,4), which has food, so eat, grow to length 2.\n\nHead at (6,4), tail at (5,4)? After eating, positions: head to (6,4), previous position (5,4) becomes tail, so [(6,4), (5,4)].\n\nDirection R.\n\nThen from there, possible moves: U to (6,5), D to (6,3), L to (5,4), R to (7,4).\n\nBut (6,3) is wall, cannot.\n\nL to (5,4) is body, collision.\n\nR to (7,4): x=7 is border wall, collision.\n\nU to (6,5): (6,5) within bounds, no wall? Internal walls: (6,3) is wall, but (6,5) not listed, so safe. Food? No.\n\nSo only possible move U to (6,5), no food, so snake moves, head to (6,5), tail removed, so new snake [(6,5)], length 1, since no eat.\n\nThen I'm at (6,5) with few options.\n\n(6,5) to U (6,6), D (6,4) but (6,4) is previous, but not body now, since tail removed, but (6,4) might be empty.\n\nAfter moving to (6,5), snake is only at (6,5), so (6,4) is empty.\n\nFrom (6,5), I can go U to (6,6), D to (6,4), L to (5,5), R to (7,5) but x=7 wall.\n\nR not possible.\n\nL to (5,5), U to (6,6), D to (6,4).\n\nBut (6,4) has no food now, eaten.\n\nFood at (3,5) and (2,2) still.\n\nBut I'm at (6,5), far from them.\n\nNot good.\n\nFrom (5,2) on turn 2, instead of U, I could go D to (5,1) or R to (6,2).\n\nGo R to (6,2) on turn 2.\n\nHead at (6,2), dir R.\n\nThen turn 3, from (6,2), possible moves: U to (6,3), but (6,3) wall, cannot.\n\nD to (6,1), L to (5,2), R to (7,2) wall.\n\nBut direction R, so cannot reverse to L.\n\nAllowed: U, D, R.\n\nU to (6,3) wall, dead if I go, but I can avoid.\n\nD to (6,1), or R to (7,2) wall.\n\nSo only possible D to (6,1), since U and R are walls or out of bound.\n\n(6,1) is within bounds, no wall, so go D to (6,1), no food, snake still length 1.\n\nHead at (6,1), dir D.\n\nThen from there, I can go L to (5,1), D to (6,0) but y=0 wall, cannot, U to (6,2), but direction D, U is reverse, not allowed? Current direction D, so cannot go U.\n\nAllowed: L to (5,1), R to (7,1) wall, D to (6,0) wall.\n\nSo only L to (5,1).\n\nGo to (5,1), no food, etc.\n\nThen I'm stuck in bottom right, far from food.\n\nNot good.\n\nSo going right might not be best.\n\nAnother option on turn 2: go D to (4,1).\n\nHead at (4,1), dir D.\n\nThen from there, I can go to (2,2) for food.\n\n(2,2) has food.\n\nFrom (4,1), possible moves: L to (3,1), R to (5,1), U to (4,2), D to (4,0) wall.\n\nDirection D, so cannot reverse to U.\n\nSo allowed: L, R, D but D to (4,0) wall, cannot.\n\nSo L to (3,1) or R to (5,1).\n\nSay go L to (3,1), no food, head at (3,1), dir L.\n\nThen turn 3, from (3,1), go to (2,1) or (3,2) or (3,0) wall, etc.\n\n(2,2) is above at y=2.\n\nFrom (3,1), I can go U to (3,2), then to (2,2).\n\nU to (3,2): (3,2) safe, no food, so snake still length 1, head at (3,2).\n\nThen from (3,2), go L to (2,2), which has food, eat, grow to length 2, head at (2,2), tail at (3,2).\n\nDirection L.\n\nThen from (2,2), possible moves: U to (2,3), D to (2,1), L to (1,2), R to (3,2) but (3,2) is body, collision.\n\nCannot go R.\n\nDirection L, so cannot reverse R.\n\nAllowed: U, D, L.\n\n(2,3): safe?

In the sequence, at turn 6 head at (2,5), turn 7 to (1,5), turn 8 to (1,6), turn 9 to (2,6), etc.\n\nIt's complicated, and I might not reach (2,2) easily due to wall at (2,4).\n\nSimilarly, (6,4) is far.\n\nSo eating (4,3) and (3,5) is good, and (2,2) might be hard to get, but it's worth +1, but with risk.\n\nSince the snake is longer, it might be riskier.\n\nBut in this grid, with obstacles, shorter snake is easier to maneuv  r.\n\nPerhaps on turn 2, I should not eat, but move to a position where I can eat multiple food.\n\nFor example, go R to (5,2), then to (5,3), then U to (5,4), then to (6,4) to eat, but as before, after eating (6,4), I have to go to (6,5), then I can go L to (5,5), then down to (5,1), etc., but then to (2,2) is far.\n\nAnd (3,5) might be eaten on the way.\n\nBut let's see the time.\n\n turn 2: go R to (5,2)\n turn 3: go U to (5,3)\n turn 4: go U to (5,4)\n turn 5: go R to (6,4) eat, grow to length 2, head at (6,4), tail at (5,4)\n turn 6: go U to (6,5) no eat, snake to [(6,5)] only, since tail removed.\n turn 7: from (6,5), go L to (5,5), no eat, head at (5,5)\n turn 8: go L to (5,4) but (5,4) was tail, but not now, so safe, no food, head at (5,4)\n turn 9: go D to (5,3), no food, etc.\n\nThen I can go to (4,3) but at turn 9, (4,3) disappears after turn 9, so on turn 9, if I am at (5,3), I can go L to (4,3) to eat if it's there, but on turn 9, countdown 1, so it is there, I can eat on turn 9 if I reach.\n\nBut from (5,3) at turn 9, go L to (4,3), if food there, eat.\n\nIn this path, at turn 9, head at (5,3), go L to (4,3), eat, grow.\n\nBut from turn 6 to 8, I was moving with length 1, so I could have eaten other food, but (2,2) is far.\n\n (3,5) at (3,5), from (5,3), I can go to (4,3), but (4,3) is food, but on turn 9.\n\nLet's not complicate.\n\nI think the safest and highest reward short-term is to eat the close food at (4,3) on turn 2, then move left to eat (3,5) by turn 5, and forget about (2,2) and (6,4) for now, as they are riskier or far.\n\nSince all food is +1, eating two is good, and I can survive long.\n\nFor the answer, I need to output actions for turn 2 and a few next turns.\n\nThe format is to output for turn t1, t1+1, etc., but since state changes, I need to specify based on the initial state.\n\nBut the actions depend on what happens, so I need to assume no other changes, and food life span decreases.\n\nAlso, no new food spawns, I assume, as not mentioned.\n\nSo based on current food.\n\nSo for turn 2: I think go U to (4,3) to eat the food.\n\nThen turn 3: from there, go L to (3,3) to avoid the wall at (4,4) and move towards (3,5).\n\nThen turn 4: from (3,3), go U to (3,4)\n\nThen turn 5: from (3,4), go U to (3,5) to eat.\n\nThen for turn 6, from (3,5), I can go U to (3,6) or other, but I need to output only a few turns, say up to turn 5 or 6.\n\nThe answer format says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but output for current and next, but not specified how many.\n\nProbably output for 5 turns or so.\n\nSince t1=2, output for turn 2,3,4,5,6.\n\nAfter turn 5, I am at (3,5), and I can decide later.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: L (from (4,3) to (3,3))\n\nTurn 4: U (from (3,3) to (3,4))\n\nTurn 5: U (from (3,4) to (3,5) eat)\n\nThen for turn 6, from (3,5), I can go U to (3,6) or L to (2,5) or R to (4,5), say go U to (3,6) for safety.\n\nBut I need to output.\n\nPerhaps output only the necessary, but I think for 5 turns.\n\nSince head direction changes, I need to keep track.\n\nIn turn 3, after moving L to (3,3), direction is L.\n\nTurn 4, move U to (3,4), direction U.\n\nTurn 5, move U to (3,5), direction U.\n\nTurn 6, from (3,5), direction U, so can go U, L, R.\n\nU to (3,6), L to (2,5), R to (4,5).\n\nAll safe, say U to (3,6).\n\nBut (3,6) has no issue.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: L\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nFor turn 6, it's optional.\n\nBut in the sequence, at turn 4, (3,4) has no food, so not eat, snake length after turn 5 is 2 or 3? Let's see:\n\nTurn 2: move U to (4,3) eat, snake length 2: [(4,3), (4,2)]\n\nTurn 3: move L to (3,3) no eat, so snake: head to (3,3), tail removed, so [(3,3), (4,3)] length 2\n\nTurn 4: move U to (3,4) no eat, snake: head to (3,4), tail removed, so [(3,4), (3,3)] length 2\n\nTurn 5: move U to (3,5) eat, so head to (3,5), tail not removed, so snake: [(3,5), (3,4), (3,3)] length 3\n\nTurn 6: move U to (3,6) no eat, snake: head to (3,6), tail removed, so [(3,6), (3,5), (3,4)] length 3\n\nEtc.\n\nNow, about the food at (2,2) and (6,4), I can try to get them later if possible, but for the plan, this seems reasonable.\n\nTo maximize, I could include (2,2), but it might not be feasible with the wall at (2,4).\n\nFor example, from (3,3) on turn 4, instead of U to (3,4), I could go D to (3,2), but (3,2) has no food, then to (2,2), but from (3,2) go L to (2,2) eat.\n\nBut let's see:\n\nTurn 2: U to (4,3) eat, snake [(4,3),(4,2)]\n\nTurn 3: L to (3,3) no eat, snake [(3,3),(4,3)]\n\nTurn 4: D to (3,2) no eat, snake: head to (3,2), tail removed, so [(3,2),(3,3)]? Positions: from [(3,3),(4,3)] move head to (3,2), not eating, so tail at (4,3) removed, body at (3,3) becomes tail, so [(3,2),(3,3)]\n\nHead at (3,2), dir D (since moved down).\n\nThen turn 5: move L to (2,2) eat, so head to (2,2), tail not removed, snake [(2,2),(3,2),(3,3)] length 3.\n\nThen from (2,2), as before, can go U to (2,3) or D to (2,1) or L to (1,2), but not R.\n\nThen to (2,3), then stuck because (2,4) wall.\n\nSo I can go to (1,2) or (2,1), but then hard to reach (3,5).\n\nWhereas in the first plan, I go to (3,5) directly.\n\nSo the first plan is better for eating (3,5).\n\nAlso, (3,5) is at y=5, higher, so going up is good.\n\nSo I think for turn 2 to 6: U, L, U, U, U\n\nBut turn 6 U is to (3,6), which is fine.\n\nTo be precise, I'll output for 5 turns: turn 2 to 6.\n\nBut turn 6 is t1+4, since t1=2, t1+1=3, t1+2=4, t1+3=5, t1+4=6.\n\nSo 5 actions.\n\nAnswer format: Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, etc.\n\nSo for this case.\n\nBut in the food, there is also (2,2) with value 1, but I think it's acceptable to miss it for now.\n\nPerhaps I can eat (2,2) first.\n\nTurn 2: go D to (4,1)\n\nThen turn 3: go L to (3,1)\n\nTurn 4: go U to (3,2)\n\nTurn 5: go L to (2,2) eat\n\nThen turn 6: from (2,2), go U to (2,3)\n\nBut then at (2,3), I can only go L or R or U, but U to (2,4) wall, so go R to (3,3) or L to (1,3)\n\nSay go R to (3,3)\n\nThen turn 7: go U to (3,4)\n\nTurn 8: go U to (3,5) eat\n\nBut at turn 8, (3,5) life span, at turn 2 life 8, turn 8 countdown 1, so present, can eat.\n\nBut I ate (2,2) on turn 5, (3,5) on turn 8, and missed (4,3) which disappears after turn 9, but at turn 8, I am at (3,5), (4,3) is at (4,3), I can go R to (4,5) or something, but not directly.\n\nFrom (3,5) at turn 8, go R to (4,5), no food, then turn 9: go D to (4,4) but (4,4) wall, cannot; go to (4,3) but (4,3) has food, but from (4,5), go L to (3,5) body or D to (4,4) wall, or R to (5,5), or U to (4,6).\n\nSay go R to (5,5), then to (5,4), but (5,4) might be empty, but (4,3) is at (4,3), I need to go to (4,4) but wall, so cannot reach (4,3) from above or left.\n\n(4,3) is surrounded? From (4,2), (5,3), (4,4) wall, (3,3), etc.\n\nAt turn 9, from (4,5), I can go D to (4,4) wall, or L to (3,5), or R to (5,5), or U to (4,6).\n\nNone lead to (4,3).\n\nFrom (3,3) earlier, I could go to (4,3), but at turn 7, from (3,3) after turn 6 at (3,3), I could go to (4,3) if I want.\n\nIn this path, at turn 6: at (2,3), go R to (3,3), no eat, snake to [(3,3),(2,3)] or something.\n\nAssume snake after turn 5: at (2,2) after eating, length 2: [(2,2),(3,2)]? When eat at (2,2), head to (2,2), tail at (3,2), so [(2,2),(3,2)]\n\nThen turn 6: move U to (2,3), no food, so head to (2,3), tail removed, new snake [(2,3),(2,2)] head at (2,3), dir U.\n\nThen turn 7: move R to (3,3), no food, head to (3,3), tail removed, new snake [(3,3),(2,3)] head at (3,3), dir R.\n\nThen turn 8: move U to (3,4), no food, head to (3,4), tail removed, new snake [(3,4),(3,3)] head at (3,4), dir U.\n\nTurn 9: move U to (3,5), eat, grow to [(3,5),(3,4),(3,3)]\n\nNow (4,3) is at (4,3), but I am at (3,5), and to go to (4,3), I need to go down to (3,4) but body, or to (4,5) then (4,4) wall, so impossible to reach (4,3) from here, and it disappears after turn 9, so I miss it.\n\nIn the first plan, I eat (4,3) and (3,5), so better to eat the close one.\n\nTherefore, I think going U on turn 2 to eat (4,3) is the best start.\n\nThen proceed as planned.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while ensuring long-term survival, the AI must prioritize eating positive food and avoiding collisions with walls, obstacles, and its own body. Given the current state at turn \\(t_1 = 2\\):\n\n- **Snake state**: Single segment at (4,2), direction R (right). No body exists yet, so no collision risk internally. Eating food will grow the snake.\n- **Walls**: Borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Internal obstacles at (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3). These cells are deadly.\n- **Food**: All food is positive (+1 value). Positions and remaining life spans:\n  - (3,5): life span 8 (disappears after turn 9)\n  - (2,2): life span 8 (disappears after turn 9)\n  - (4,3): life span 8 (disappears after turn 9)\n  - (6,4): life span 9 (disappears after turn 10)\n- **Movement constraints**: Current direction is R, so instant reverse to L is not allowed. Allowed moves from (4,2) are U, D, R.\n\n### Strategic Analysis (5+ turns ahead)\n- **Immediate opportunity**: Food at (4,3) is adjacent and can be eaten on turn 2 by moving U. This scores +1 and grows the snake to length 2, providing more flexibility for future moves.\n- **Risks**: \n  - After eating (4,3), the snake head moves to (4,3) with direction U. From there, moving U to (4,4) is impossible due to the wall, so only L (to (3,3)) or R (to (5,3)) are safe.\n  - Food at (3,5) is reachable in 3 moves (e.g., via (3,3) and (3,4)), with life span allowing consumption by turn 5.\n  - Food at (2,2) is riskier due to the wall at (2,4), which creates a dead end. It is less accessible and may not be worth pursuing immediately.\n  - Food at (6,4) is near obstacles (e.g., (6,3) wall) and borders, increasing collision risk. It has a longer life span, so it can be targeted later if possible.\n- **Long-term survival focus**: \n  - Eating (4,3) on turn 2 and (3,5) by turn 5 secures +2 score early. The path (4,2) → (4,3) → (3,3) → (3,4) → (3,5) avoids walls/obstacles and minimizes body collision risk as the snake grows.\n  - After turn 5, the snake can navigate to open areas (e.g., (3,6)) to avoid dead ends. Missing (2,2) and (6,4) is acceptable for now, as they are lower priority due to risks and distance.\n  - With the snake growing to length 3 by turn 5, future moves must avoid the body, but the planned path keeps the body in non-restrictive positions.\n- **Alternative paths considered but rejected**:\n  - Moving R to (5,2) on turn 2 avoids immediate eating but delays growth and makes reaching (3,5) or (2,2) slower. It also risks being cornered near (6,4) with obstacles.\n  - Moving D to (4,1) on turn 2 targets (2,2) but takes more turns and risks the wall at (2,4), potentially trapping the snake after eating.\n  - Not eating (4,3) risks missing it later due to life span, and it is the easiest +1 with no immediate downside.\n\n### Action Sequence (Turns 2 to 6)\nThe sequence below eats (4,3) on turn 2 and (3,5) on turn 5, scoring +2 by turn 5. It ensures survival by avoiding all walls, obstacles, and body collisions. Directions are chosen to align with movement constraints (no instant reverse). After turn 5, the snake moves to (3,6) on turn 6 for safety and to position for future food opportunities.\n\n- **Turn 2 (t1)**: Move U (up) to (4,3) – eats food at (4,3), score +1, snake grows to length 2: positions [(4,3), (4,2)], head direction U.\n- **Turn 3 (t1+1)**: Move L (left) to (3,3) – no food, snake moves: head to (3,3), tail removed, positions [(3,3), (4,3)], head direction L.\n- **Turn 4 (t1+2)**: Move U (up) to (3,4) – no food, snake moves: head to (3,4), tail removed, positions [(3,4), (3,3)], head direction U.\n- **Turn 5 (t1+3)**: Move U (up) to (3,5) – eats food at (3,5), score +1 (total +2), snake grows to length 3: positions [(3,5), (3,4), (3,3)], head direction U.\n- **Turn 6 (t1+4)**: Move U (up) to (3,6) – no food, snake moves: head to (3,6), tail removed, positions [(3,6), (3,5), (3,4)], head direction U. This move avoids the body and walls, positioning the snake for potential future moves northward.\n\n### Validation\n- **Turn 2 (U)**: From (4,2) to (4,3) – eats food, valid move (no reverse from R).\n- **Turn 3 (L)**: From (4,3) to (3,3) – no food, direction L valid (not reverse of U).\n- **Turn 4 (U)**: From (3,3) to (3,4) – no food, direction U valid (not reverse of L).\n- **Turn 5 (U)**: From (3,4) to (3,5) – eats food, direction U valid.\n- **Turn 6 (U)**: From (3,5) to (3,6) – no food, direction U valid (not reverse).\n- **Collision checks**: \n  - No wall or obstacle in the path: (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6) are all free of walls/obstacles.\n  - Body collision: After growth, the body is avoided (e.g., on turn 3, moving to (3,3) from (4,3) leaves body at (4,3), no overlap). On turn 6, moving to (3,6) from (3,5) avoids body at (3,4) and (3,5).\n- **Food life spans**: (4,3) eaten on turn 2, (3,5) eaten on turn 5 – both within life spans (8 at turn 2). (2,2) and (6,4) not eaten but can be considered later if reachable without risk.\n\nThis plan scores +2 in 5 turns, prioritizes survival by avoiding high-risk areas, and positions the snake for flexibility. Beyond turn 6, the AI can target (6,4) or other food if spawned, but the output is limited to 5 actions as per typical planning depth.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 2\\text{: U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 3\\text{: L} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 4\\text{: U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 5\\text{: U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6\\text{: U} \\end{array} }",

The grid is 8x8 since borders are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so coordinates from (0,0) to (7,7).\n\nWalls: Border cells are all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So, I can't move to any of those cells. Also, internal obstacles at (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3). So these are blocked too.\n\nSnake positions: Head at (4,3), and only one body segment at (4,2). So the snake is 2 cells long. Head direction is Up, meaning it moved up to (4,3) from (4,2) I assume. Since direction is U, and positions are [(4,3), (4,2)], so from turn 2 to turn 3, it moved up to (4,3).\n\nNow, food:\n\n- (3,5) with life span 7, value 1 (positive)\n\n- (2,2) with life span 7, value 1 (positive)\n\n- (6,4) with life span 8, value 1 (positive)\n\nAll food is positive, no negative food mentioned. Value is 1 for all, and life span given; for (3,5) it's 7, meaning it will disappear after 7 turns, but since it's turn 3, it will disappear after turn 10? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 3, life span 7 means it has 7 turns left including turn 3. So after turn 3, it has 6 left, and so on, until life span 0, it disappears.\n\nBut for planning, I need to think about how long it will last.\n\nSimilarly, (2,2) has life span 7, so same as above.\n\n(6,4) has life span 8, so one more turn.\n\nNow, snake head is at (4,3), direction U.\n\nPossible moves: Since head direction is U, I can move U, L, or R, but not D because that would be instant reverse. Rules say: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\" So current direction is U, so I cannot move D on the next turn. But for the action on turn t1=3, I can choose U, L, or R.\n\nDirections: U: (x,y+1), D: (x,y-1), L: (x-1,y), R: (x+1,y)\n\nHead at (4,3), moving U would be to (4,4), but (4,4) is an obstacle! Internal obstacle at (4,4), so I cannot move there.\n\nSimilarly, moving L: (3,3)\n\nMoving R: (5,3)\n\nMoving D: but cannot, because opposite direction, and also, even if I could, (4,2) is the current tail, but since tail will move, it might be ok, but direction constraint prevents D.\n\nSo possible actions from (4,3):\n\n- U: to (4,4) — but (4,4) is obstacle, so invalid.\n\n- D: to (4,2) — but (4,2) is current tail, and also, moving opposite to current direction U, so invalid.\n\n- L: to (3,3) — is this free? Let me check walls and obstacles.\n\nWalls: borders x=0,7 y=0,7, so (3,3) is within 1-6? x=3, y=3, min x=0 to 7, so x=3 is between 1 and 6? No, x=0 and x=7 are borders, so cells from x=1 to x=6, y=1 to y=6 are inside, except obstacles.\n\nCoordinates: x from 0 to 7, but x=0 and x=7 are walls, similarly y=0 and y=7 walls. So playable area is x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? x=0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7 but x=0 and x=7 are walls, so cells with x=1 to x=6 and y=1 to y=6 are free except obstacles.\n\ny=0 and y=7 are walls, so y from 1 to 6.\n\nIn this case, (3,3): x=3, y=3, which should be free, not border, and not in internal obstacles list: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3). (6,3) is obstacle, but (3,3) not listed, so should be free.\n\nSimilarly, R: to (5,3) — (5,3) not in obstacles, and not border, so should be free.\n\nBut (6,3) is obstacle, but (5,3) is different.\n\nNow, moving to (3,3) or (5,3).\n\nAlso, I need to consider the tail. Snake is only two cells: head at (4,3), tail at (4,2). After I move, the tail will move forward, so the cell (4,2) will be free, unless I eat food.\n\nCurrently, no food at (4,2) or anything, I think.\n\nFood is at (3,5), (2,2), (6,4).\n\n(2,2) is the tail position? Tail is at (4,2), not (2,2). (2,2) is different.\n\nSo from (4,3), moving L to (3,3) or R to (5,3).\n\nI need to think multiple turns ahead, at least 5 turns.\n\nAlso, consider the food positions and their life spans.\n\nFirst, let's list all possible moves for turn 3:\n\n- L: to (3,3)\n\n- R: to (5,3)\n\nU is invalid, D is invalid.\n\nSo only two choices: L or R.\n\nNow, after moving, on turn 4, the snake will have new head position, and the tail will move, so the body will be the previous head position.\n\nCurrent: positions [(4,3), (4,2)]\n\nAfter action on turn 3:\n\nIf I move L to (3,3), new positions: head (3,3), body (4,3), tail (4,2) was there, but since no food eaten, tail moves, so new body is (4,3), and tail was (4,2), but since no growth, tail moves to where? The snake moves: head to new position, each segment moves to the next position.\n\nSince not eating, length same, so new head at (3,3), and the body segment that was at (4,3) moves to where the tail was? No.\n\nSnake movement: when moving, the head goes to the new cell, and each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment. So for a snake of length 2: head moves to new position, the tail segment moves to where the head was, I think? Let's see.\n\nInitial positions: segment 0: head (4,3), segment 1: body (4,2)\n\nAfter moving head to (3,3): new head is (3,3), then the body segment moves to where the head was, which is (4,3). So new positions: [(3,3), (4,3)]\n\nSimilarly, if move R to (5,3): new positions [(5,3), (4,3)]\n\nNow, direction: if I move L, new head direction is L; if move R, new direction is R.\n\nNow, for turn 4, I need to consider possible actions from there.\n\nBut I need to think about the food.\n\nFood at (3,5), (2,2), (6,4).\n\n(3,5) is above, (2,2) is down-left, (6,4) is right and up.\n\nLife spans: at turn 3, (3,5) has life span 7, so it will disappear after turn 3 + 7 - 1 = turn 9? Let's clarify life span.\n\nLife span: \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nSo for food at (3,5) with life span 7 at turn 3, it means:\n\n- Turn 3: life span 7\n\n- Turn 4: life span 6\n\n- ...\n\n- Turn 9: life span 1\n\n- Turn 10: life span 0, disappears, so not available on turn 10.\n\nSimilarly, (2,2) life span 7 at turn 3, same as above.\n\n(6,4) life span 8 at turn 3:\n\n- Turn 3: 8\n\n- Turn 4: 7\n\n- ...\n\n- Turn 10: 1\n\n- Turn 11: 0, disappears.\n\nNow, since I need to maximize score, I should eat positive food when possible, but avoid risks, especially the tail reward danger.\n\nTail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nIn this case, snake is short, only length 2, so tail is close.\n\nBut currently, no food at tail position.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the two choices for turn 3: L or R.\n\nFirst, option 1: Move L to (3,3) on turn 3.\n\nNew positions: head (3,3), body (4,3)\n\nNew direction: L (since moved left)\n\nNow, on turn 4, from (3,3), possible moves:\n\nCurrent direction L, so cannot move R (opposite).\n\nPossible: U, D, L? Directions: from (3,3)\n\n- U: (3,4) — is this free? y=4, x=3. Check obstacles: internal obstacles at (1,4), (2,4), (4,4), (5,6), (6,3). (3,4) not listed, and not border, so should be free.\n\n- D: (3,2) — y=2, x=3, not obstacle, not border.\n\n- L: (2,3) — x=2,y=3, not obstacle? Obstacles: (2,4) is obstacle, but (2,3) is different, so should be free.\n\n- R: (4,3) — but (4,3) is now the body position, and since body is there, moving to it would be collision. Also, direction: moving R would be opposite to current L? Current direction is L, so moving R is opposite, which is invalid anyway.\n\nCannot move opposite, so R invalid.\n\nAlso, moving to (4,3) is body collision immediately.\n\nSo possible moves from (3,3) on turn 4: U, D, L.\n\nNow, similarly, if I had moved R on turn 3 to (5,3), new head (5,3), body (4,3), direction R.\n\nThen turn 4, from (5,3), possible moves:\n\nCurrent direction R, so cannot move L (opposite).\n\n- U: (5,4) — free? Obstacles: (4,4) is obstacle, (5,4) not listed, should be free.\n\n- D: (5,2) — free, not obstacle.\n\n- R: (6,3) — but (6,3) is internal obstacle, so invalid.\n\n- L: (4,3) — body position, collision, and opposite direction invalid.\n\nSo only U or D possible from (5,3).\n\nNow, back to planning.\n\nI need to think about getting to the food.\n\nFood at (3,5): from (3,3), I can go U to (3,4), then U to (3,5) to eat it, but need to see if safe.\n\nSimilarly, (2,2) from (3,3), I can go L to (2,3), then D to (2,2)? But (2,2) is food, but let's see.\n\n(6,4) from (5,3), I can go U to (5,4), then R to (6,4)? But (6,4) is food, and (6,3) is obstacle, so from (5,4), moving R to (6,4) should be possible, since (6,4) not obstacle.\n\n(6,4) is food position, not obstacle.\n\nInternal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3). So (6,4) is not obstacle.\n\nSimilarly, walls only borders.\n\nNow, life spans: all food have high life span, (3,5) and (2,2) disappear after turn 9, (6,4) after turn 10, so plenty of time, since it's turn 3.\n\nBut I need to avoid risks.\n\nAlso, tail reward danger: since snake is short, moving to tail position might be dangerous if food is there, but no food at tail now.\n\nLet's consider the path to each food.\n\nFirst, from current position (4,3), if I move L to (3,3), I can then go to (3,5) in two moves: turn 4 U to (3,4), turn 5 U to (3,5). But on turn 5, when I move to (3,5), I eat food, so snake grows, length becomes 3.\n\nPositions: turn 3: move L to (3,3), positions [(3,3), (4,3)]\n\nTurn 4: move U to (3,4), new head (3,4), body moves to (3,3), so positions [(3,4), (3,3)]\n\nTurn 5: move U to (3,5), eat food, so head to (3,5), and since ate food, tail does not move, so new segment added, positions: head (3,5), then previous head (3,4) becomes body, and (3,3) remains, so [(3,5), (3,4), (3,3)]\n\nLength 3.\n\nNow, is there any risk? On turn 5, when I eat at (3,5), the tail is at (3,3), which is not adjacent to head (3,5), since (3,5) and (3,3) are two apart, so no tail reward danger.\n\nAfter that, I need to continue.\n\nBut I have to think multiple turns.\n\nSimilarly, from (3,3), I could go to (2,2).\n\nTo (2,2): from (3,3), move L to (2,3) on turn 4, then D to (2,2) on turn 5.\n\nOn turn 5, move to (2,2), eat food, grow to length 3.\n\nPositions: turn 4: from (3,3) move L to (2,3), positions [(2,3), (3,3)]\n\nTurn 5: move D to (2,2), eat, so head (2,2), body (2,3), and tail (3,3) stays, so [(2,2), (2,3), (3,3)]\n\nNow, (2,2) is food, and tail is at (3,3), which is adjacent? Head at (2,2), tail at (3,3), distance: |dx=1, dy=1|, so adjacent diagonally? But in grid, adjacent means sharing edge, so up, down, left, right, not diagonal.\n\nRules: \"adjacent\" probably means Manhattan adjacent, sharing a side.\n\nSo (2,2) and (3,3) are not adjacent; they are diagonal, so not directly connected.\n\nAdjacent cells for (2,2) would be (2,3), (2,1), (1,2), (3,2). (3,3) is not adjacent; it's diagonal.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTail is at (3,3), not adjacent to (2,2).\n\nNow, if I move R on turn 3 to (5,3).\n\nThen from (5,3), on turn 4, I can move U to (5,4), then on turn 5 move R to (6,4) to eat.\n\nTurn 3: move R to (5,3), positions [(5,3), (4,3)]\n\nTurn 4: move U to (5,4), positions [(5,4), (5,3)]\n\nTurn 5: move R to (6,4), eat, grow to length 3: positions [(6,4), (5,4), (5,3)]\n\nNow, (6,4) and tail at (5,3), which is adjacent? (6,4) and (5,3): dx=1, dy=1, diagonal, not adjacent, so ok.\n\nAll seem possible.\n\nBut I need to avoid risks and think long term.\n\nAlso, after eating, the snake is longer, and I need to survive.\n\nMoreover, there might be other considerations.\n\nAnother thing: food can spawn under body, but here, no food under body currently.\n\nAlso, tail reward danger only if head adjacent to tail and tail cell has food.\n\nBut in this case, when eating, tail doesn't have food.\n\nNow, let's think about the grid and obstacles.\n\nInternal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3)\n\n(4,4) is obstacle, which is above the head, so I cannot go up from (4,3).\n\nNow, from the food positions:\n\n(3,5): I can reach it in 2 moves if I go left first.\n\n(2,2): can reach in 2 moves if go left then down, but from (3,3) to (2,3) to (2,2).\n\n(6,4): can reach in 2 moves if I go right first, then up then right.\n\nBut from (5,3) to (5,4) to (6,4).\n\nNow, all food are positive, so I should try to eat them.\n\nBut I need to prioritize which one to go for, considering the path and future moves.\n\nSince I need to think 5+ turns ahead, let's simulate both options.\n\nFirst, if I go left on turn 3 to (3,3).\n\nThen on turn 4, I have choices: U, D, L.\n\nIf I go U to (3,4), then on turn 5, I can go U to (3,5) to eat.\n\nAfter eating at (3,5), positions: [(3,5), (3,4), (3,3)]\n\nNow, direction: I moved U to (3,5), so direction U.\n\nNow on turn 6, from (3,5), possible moves.\n\nCurrent direction U, so cannot D.\n\n- U: (3,6) — y=6, is this border? y=7 is wall, y=6 is not border, but y=6 is within 1-6? y=0 and y=7 walls, so y=1 to 6 free, but y=6 is ok.\n\n(3,6): not obstacle, should be free.\n\n- D: (3,4) — but (3,4) is body, collision, and opposite direction, invalid.\n\n- L: (2,5) — free? obstacles: (1,4), (2,4), etc. (2,5) not listed, should be free.\n\n- R: (4,5) — free? (4,4) obstacle, but (4,5) not, should be free.\n\nBut (4,4) is obstacle at (4,4), so (4,5) is above it.\n\n(4,5) not in obstacles list, so free.\n\nSo on turn 6, I can go U, L, or R.\n\nIf I go U to (3,6), then I'm near top, y=6, which is close to wall y=7, but not wall yet.\n\nBut I might not have food there.\n\nI could go to other food.\n\n(2,2) is still there, but I'm at (3,5), which is far from (2,2).\n\nFrom (3,5), I could go down or something.\n\nBut let's see the other food.\n\n(6,4) is another food.\n\nBut from (3,5) to (6,4) is a bit far.\n\nAfter eating at (3,5), I need to find a way to survive and eat more.\n\nSimilarly, if from (3,3) on turn 4, I go L to (2,3), then turn 5 to (2,2) eat.\n\nThen positions after turn 5: [(2,2), (2,3), (3,3)]\n\nDirection: moved D to (2,2), so direction D? From (2,3) to (2,2), so down.\n\nOn turn 6, from (2,2), possible moves.\n\nCurrent direction D, so cannot U.\n\n- U: (2,3) — body position, collision, invalid.\n\n- D: (2,1) — y=1, not border? y=0 wall, y=1 free, not obstacle.\n\n- L: (1,2) — x=1, not border? x=0 wall, x=1 free. Obstacles? (1,4) is obstacle, but (1,2) not, so free.\n\n- R: (3,2) — free, not obstacle.\n\nBut cannot U, so D, L, or R.\n\n(2,1) or (1,2) or (3,2).\n\nNow, (2,1) is near bottom, etc.\n\nBut I need to consider the whole path.\n\nNow, back to turn 3 choice.\n\nIf I go right on turn 3 to (5,3).\n\nThen turn 4, from (5,3), I can go U or D.\n\nIf go U to (5,4), then turn 5 to (6,4) eat.\n\nPositions after turn 5: [(6,4), (5,4), (5,3)]\n\nDirection: moved R to (6,4), so direction R.\n\nOn turn 6, from (6,4), possible moves.\n\nCurrent direction R, cannot L.\n\n- L: (5,4) — body position, collision, invalid.\n\n- R: (7,4) — but x=7 is border wall, so invalid.\n\n- U: (6,5) — free? Obstacles: (5,6), (6,5) not listed, should be free.\n\n- D: (6,3) — but (6,3) is obstacle! Internal obstacle at (6,3), so invalid.\n\nSo only possible move is U to (6,5).\n\nBecause L invalid (body), R invalid (wall), D invalid (obstacle), so only U.\n\nMust go up.\n\nMove U to (6,5).\n\nThen positions: head (6,5), body (6,4), tail (5,4)? After move: head to (6,5), body moves to (6,4), tail to (5,4)? Positions: before move, [(6,4), (5,4), (5,3)]\n\nAfter moving head to (6,5), the body segments move: the first body segment moves to where head was, (6,4), and the tail segment moves to where the first body was, (5,4). So new positions: [(6,5), (6,4), (5,4)]\n\nLength 3.\n\nDirection: moved U, so direction U.\n\nOn turn 7, from (6,5), possible moves.\n\nCurrent direction U, cannot D.\n\n- U: (6,6) — y=6, free? Not border, not obstacle.\n\n- D: (6,4) — body, collision, invalid.\n\n- L: (5,5) — free? Not obstacle.\n\n- R: (7,5) — x=7 wall, invalid.\n\nSo can go U or L.\n\nIf go U to (6,6), near top.\n\nBut no food there, and I need to survive.\n\n(6,6) is not food, and y=6, close to wall.\n\nBut I can move later.\n\nNow, compare to if I had gone left.\n\nIn the case where I go to (6,4), after eating, I am forced to go up to (6,5), and then I have choices, but I'm near the edge.\n\nWhereas if I go to (3,5), from (3,5) I have more options: U to (3,6), L to (2,5), R to (4,5), etc.\n\n(4,5) is free, as I thought.\n\nAlso, (2,2) is still available, but it's at bottom.\n\nNow, another point: (2,2) has the same life span, but (6,4) has one more turn.\n\nBut since I can reach both, it might not matter.\n\nBut let's think about risk.\n\nIn the right path, when I go to (6,4), then to (6,5), I am at (6,5), which has only two moves: U or L.\n\nIf I go U to (6,6), then on turn 8, from (6,6), direction U, can go U? (6,7) is y=7 wall, invalid. D to (6,5) body, invalid. L to (5,6) but (5,6) is obstacle! Internal obstacle at (5,6), so invalid. R to (7,6) wall invalid. So from (6,6), if I go there, I would be trapped! No moves.\n\nFrom (6,6):\n\n- U: (6,7) wall, invalid\n\n- D: (6,5) — if body is there, collision, but let's see positions.\n\nIf on turn 7 I go U to (6,6), positions: head (6,6), body (6,5), tail (6,4) or something.\n\nBefore: at turn 6, positions [(6,5), (6,4), (5,4)]\n\nTurn 7: move U to (6,6), new head (6,6), body to (6,5), tail to (6,4)? Tail was (5,4), moves to where the first body was? Segments: head moves to (6,6), segment 1 moves to (6,5) (previous head), segment 2 moves to (6,4) (previous segment 1 position).\n\nPrevious positions: index 0: (6,5), index 1: (6,4), index 2: (5,4)\n\nAfter move: head to (6,6), then index 1 moves to (6,5), index 2 moves to (6,4). So new positions: [(6,6), (6,5), (6,4)]\n\nNow, on turn 8, from (6,6):\n\n- U: (6,7) wall, invalid\n\n- D: (6,5) — but (6,5) is body position, collision, invalid\n\n- L: (5,6) — but (5,6) is internal obstacle, invalid\n\n- R: (7,6) wall, invalid\n\nNo possible moves! Snake dies.\n\nTherefore, if I go to (6,6), I die on turn 8.\n\nBut on turn 7 from (6,5), I could go L to (5,5) instead of U.\n\nFrom (6,5) on turn 7, I can go L to (5,5).\n\nThen positions: head to (5,5), body to (6,5), tail to (6,4)? Previous positions: [(6,5), (6,4), (5,4)]\n\nAfter moving head to (5,5), body moves: segment 1 to (6,5), segment 2 to (6,4). So [(5,5), (6,5), (6,4)]\n\nDirection: moved L, so direction L.\n\nNow, (5,5) is free, I assume.\n\nOn turn 8, from (5,5), possible moves.\n\nCurrent direction L, cannot R.\n\n- R: (6,5) body, invalid, and opposite? Current L, R opposite, invalid.\n\n- L: (4,5) — free? Not obstacle.\n\n- U: (5,6) — but (5,6) obstacle, invalid.\n\n- D: (5,4) — but (5,4) is not body? Current body at (6,5) and (6,4), (5,4) is where tail was? In positions, tail is at (6,4), so (5,4) is empty? Let's see: positions before move turn 8: [(5,5), (6,5), (6,4)]\n\nSo (5,4) is not occupied, but is it free? (5,4) not in obstacles, but (4,4) is obstacle, (5,4) different.\n\n(5,4): not listed in obstacles, so free.\n\nD to (5,4) should be possible.\n\nMoves:\n\n- U: (5,6) obstacle, invalid\n\n- D: (5,4) — free? (5,4) not obstacle, not wall, so should be ok.\n\n- L: (4,5) — free\n\n- R: (6,5) body, invalid\n\nSo can go D or L.\n\nIf go D to (5,4), but (5,4) is adjacent to tail? Tail is at (6,4), which is right of (5,4)? (5,4) and (6,4) are adjacent horizontally.\n\nIf I move to (5,4), head to (5,4), and tail is at (6,4), which is adjacent, but is there food at tail? Tail position is (6,4), which had food, but I ate it on turn 5, so no food there now. The cell (6,4) had food which I ate, so it's empty now.\n\nAfter eating, the food is consumed, so cell is empty.\n\nSo moving to (5,4), tail at (6,4), adjacent, but no food at (6,4), so no tail reward danger. Tail reward danger only if the tail cell has food and I eat it while adjacent.\n\nHere, no food, so moving to (5,4) is ok, but (5,4) is the cell, and I move to it.\n\nIf I move D to (5,4), positions: head to (5,4), body to (5,5), tail to (6,5)? Previous: [(5,5), (6,5), (6,4)]\n\nAfter move: head (5,4), body moves: segment 1 to (5,5), segment 2 to (6,5). So [(5,4), (5,5), (6,5)]\n\nNow, tail at (6,5), head at (5,4), not adjacent.\n\nThen I can continue.\n\nBut I have no food, need to find more.\n\nBut in this path, when I was at (6,5) on turn 7, going U leads to death, going L to (5,5) is possible.\n\nBut (5,5) is near (5,6) obstacle.\n\nBack to the left path.\n\nIf on turn 3 I go L to (3,3).\n\nThen turn 4, I can go U to (3,4), turn 5 U to (3,5) eat.\n\nThen positions [(3,5), (3,4), (3,3)]\n\nTurn 6, from (3,5), I can go U to (3,6), L to (2,5), or R to (4,5).\n\nIf I go R to (4,5), for example.\n\n(4,5) is free, as established.\n\nMove R to (4,5), direction R.\n\nPositions: head (4,5), body (3,5), tail (3,4)? Previous: [(3,5), (3,4), (3,3)]\n\nAfter move: head (4,5), body to (3,5), tail to (3,4). So [(4,5), (3,5), (3,4)]\n\nNow, on turn 7, from (4,5), possible moves.\n\nCurrent direction R, cannot L.\n\n- L: (3,5) body, invalid\n\n- R: (5,5) — free? (5,5) not obstacle\n\n- U: (4,6) — y=6, free\n\n- D: (4,4) — but (4,4) obstacle, invalid\n\nSo can go R or U.\n\nIf go R to (5,5), then similar to before.\n\nBut I can go to other food.\n\n(2,2) is still available, but I'm at (4,5), (2,2) is at bottom left.\n\nFrom (3,5) on turn 6, I could go L to (2,5) instead.\n\n(2,5) free.\n\nMove L to (2,5), direction L.\n\nPositions: head (2,5), body (3,5), tail (3,4)\n\nThen on turn 7, from (2,5), possible moves.\n\nCurrent direction L, cannot R.\n\n- R: (3,5) body, invalid\n\n- L: (1,5) — free? x=1, y=5, not border, not obstacle ( (1,4) obstacle but different y)\n\n- U: (2,6) — free\n\n- D: (2,4) — but (2,4) obstacle, invalid\n\nSo can go L or U.\n\n(1,5) or (2,6).\n\nThen I can go down towards (2,2), but (2,4) is obstacle, so I need to go around.\n\nFor example, from (2,5), go L to (1,5), then D to (1,4) but (1,4) obstacle, invalid.\n\n(1,4) is obstacle, so from (1,5), cannot go down.\n\nGo U to (1,6), etc.\n\nBut (2,2) is at (2,2), so to reach it, from (2,5), I can go down? But (2,4) obstacle, so I cannot go directly down. I need to go left or right then down.\n\nFor example, from (2,5), go L to (1,5), then? (1,5) to (1,4) obstacle, cannot. U to (1,6), but then away.\n\nGo from (2,5) to (2,6) first, but (2,6) free, then I can go? From (2,6), U to (2,7) wall, D to (2,5) body, L to (1,6), R to (3,6), etc.\n\nNot efficient to (2,2).\n\nFrom (3,3) on turn 4, instead of going U, I could go directly to (2,2) via L then D.\n\nTurn 4: from (3,3) move L to (2,3)\n\nTurn 5: move D to (2,2) eat.\n\nThen at (2,2), with positions [(2,2), (2,3), (3,3)]\n\nOn turn 6, from (2,2), can go D to (2,1), L to (1,2), or R to (3,2).\n\nSay go R to (3,2), then I can go up or something.\n\nBut (3,5) is still there.\n\nTo eat (3,5), from (2,2) to (3,2) to (3,3) to (3,4) to (3,5), but (3,3) might be occupied? On turn 6, if I go to (3,2), positions: from [(2,2), (2,3), (3,3)] move R to (3,2), new head (3,2), body (2,2), tail (2,3)? Previous positions: index 0 (2,2), index 1 (2,3), index 2 (3,3)\n\nAfter move head to (3,2), body: index 1 to (2,2), index 2 to (2,3). So [(3,2), (2,2), (2,3)]\n\nThen on turn 7, from (3,2), can go U to (3,3), but (3,3) is not body, but where is it? Positions have (2,3) and (3,2), (2,2), so (3,3) free? Yes, not occupied.\n\nMove U to (3,3), then positions [(3,3), (3,2), (2,2)]\n\nThen turn 8, from (3,3) to (3,4), etc.\n\nBut (3,4) might be free, turn 9 to (3,5) eat.\n\nBut (3,5) disappears after turn 9, so on turn 9 it has life span 1, can be eaten, but after eaten, disappears.\n\nAt turn 3, life span 7, so on turn 9: life span 1, can be eaten on turn 9, then on turn 10 gone.\n\nSimilarly, I can reach on turn 9.\n\nBut it takes many turns.\n\nIf I go for (3,5) first, I eat on turn 5, which is earlier.\n\nSimilarly, for (6,4), if I go right, I eat on turn 5.\n\nBut in the right path, after eating at (6,4), I have the risk of getting trapped if I go up, but I can go left to (5,5) to avoid.\n\nBut (5,5) is near obstacles.\n\nNow, another point: the food at (2,2) might be harder to reach later because of the obstacle at (2,4) and (1,4), blocking the area.\n\nSimilarly, (3,5) is easier to reach from left.\n\n(6,4) is on the right.\n\nSince I am at (4,3), and going left allows me to eat (3,5) quickly with less risk, while going right to (6,4) has a potential trap if I'm not careful.\n\nBut I can avoid the trap by not going up to (6,6).\n\nIn the left path, after eating (3,5), I have more space to move.\n\nAlso, I can consider eating multiple food.\n\nFor example, after eating (3,5), I can go to (2,2) or (6,4), but (6,4) might disappear later.\n\n(6,4) life span 8 at turn 3, so until turn 10.\n\nTurn 3: life span 8, so on turn 10: life span 1, can be eaten on turn 10.\n\nSimilarly, (3,5) on turn 9.\n\n(2,2) on turn 9.\n\nSo I have time.\n\nBut to maximize score, I should eat as many as possible.\n\nNow, from the current position, going left to (3,3) allows me to reach (3,5) in two moves, eating on turn 5.\n\nGoing right to (5,3) allows me to reach (6,4) in two moves, eating on turn 5.\n\nBut going to (6,4) has the issue with the obstacle at (6,3) and (5,6), limiting movement.\n\nWhereas (3,5) area has fewer obstacles; only (4,4) is obstacle, but I can go around.\n\nAlso, (2,2) is there, but with obstacles nearby.\n\nMoreover, in the answer, I need to output actions for multiple turns, but the format says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but answer format is to list actions for turns starting from t1.\n\n\"Answer Format: Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\"\n\nBut it doesn't specify how many turns to list. Probably I need to list until I have a plan for a few turns.\n\nSince it's to maximize score, and I need to survive, I should choose a path that allows me to eat one food safely and then have options for more.\n\nGoing left seems better because:\n\n- I can eat (3,5) quickly on turn 5.\n\n- After that, I have open space to move, e.g., to (4,5) or (2,5), etc.\n\n- Whereas going right, after eating (6,4), I am in a corner with obstacles, and might be forced into a risky position.\n\nAlso, if I go to (6,4), on turn 5, when I move to (6,4), the tail is at (5,3), which is not adjacent, but later when I move, it might be tight.\n\nBut in the left case, no such issue.\n\nMoreover, I can also consider going to (2,2) from left, but it might take longer.\n\nFor now, on turn 3, I should go left to (3,3).\n\nThen on turn 4, from (3,3), I can go up to (3,4) to approach (3,5).\n\nThen turn 5 to (3,5) eat.\n\nAfter that, I need to decide where to go.\n\nBut for the answer, I need to list actions for several turns.\n\nThe state is at turn 3, so I need action for turn 3, turn 4, etc.\n\nSince I think going left is better, let's plan the moves.\n\nTurn 3: move L to (3,3)\n\nThen turn 4: move U to (3,4) — to go towards (3,5)\n\nTurn 5: move U to (3,5) eat.\n\nNow after turn 5, positions [(3,5), (3,4), (3,3)]\n\nNow on turn 6, from (3,5), I need to move. I can go R to (4,5) for example, to explore or go towards (6,4).\n\n(4,5) is free.\n\nMove R to (4,5), direction R.\n\nPositions: [(4,5), (3,5), (3,4)]\n\nTurn 7, from (4,5), I can go R to (5,5) or U to (4,6), D is obstacle.\n\nGo R to (5,5), positions [(5,5), (4,5), (3,5)]\n\nThen turn 8, from (5,5), can go R to (6,5) or U to (5,6) but (5,6) obstacle, or D to (5,4) but (5,4) might be free? (5,4) not obstacle.\n\n(5,4) free.\n\nBut I want to go to (6,4), which is below.\n\n(6,4) is at (6,4), from (5,5), I can go D to (5,4), then R to (6,4) if possible.\n\nOn turn 8, from (5,5), move D to (5,4), positions: head (5,4), body (5,5), tail (4,5)? Previous: [(5,5), (4,5), (3,5)]\n\nAfter move: head (5,4), body to (5,5), tail to (4,5). So [(5,4), (5,5), (4,5)]\n\nDirection D.\n\nThen turn 9, from (5,4), can go R to (6,4) to eat, if food still there.\n\n(6,4) life span: at turn 3, life span 8, so on turn 9: turn 3:8, turn4:7, turn5:6, turn6:5, turn7:4, turn8:3, turn9:2, so on turn9 life span 2, can be eaten.\n\nMove to (6,4) on turn 9.\n\nBut (6,4) and tail: tail is at (4,5), not adjacent, so ok.\n\nEat, grow.\n\nBut this is one possible path.\n\nI could go directly from (3,5) to other places.\n\nBut since I need to output, for now, I can list turns 3 to, say, 6 or 7.\n\nBut the answer should start from turn 3 action.\n\nAlso, I need to confirm if going left is indeed better.\n\nAnother thing: on turn 4, from (3,3), if I go to (3,4), it's fine, but I could go to (2,3) instead to go to (2,2).\n\nBut (2,2) eating on turn 5, then I am at bottom, and (3,5) is up, with obstacle at (2,4), so harder to reach (3,5).\n\nWhereas if I eat (3,5) first, I can later go down to (2,2) by going around.\n\nFor example, from (3,5) go to (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), etc., but (4,3) might be occupied or not.\n\nBut it takes time.\n\nSince (2,2) and (3,5) both disappear after turn 9, I need to eat before that.\n\nBut with planning, I can eat both.\n\nBut for immediate action, going to (3,5) seems more straightforward.\n\nAlso, the food at (2,2) is near obstacles, which might be riskier.\n\nFor example, to reach (2,2), I need to go to (2,3) then (2,2), but (2,4) is obstacle above, so if I go to (2,3), I can only go down to (2,2) or left to (1,3), etc., but after eating at (2,2), I might be constrained.\n\nWhereas (3,5) has more freedom.\n\nSimilarly, (6,4) is near the obstacle (6,3) and wall.\n\nSo overall, I think going left to eat (3,5) is the best first move.\n\nTherefore, for turn 3, action: L\n\nThen turn 4, to go towards (3,5), move U to (3,4)\n\nThen turn 5, move U to (3,5) eat.\n\nNow for turn 6, I need to move away. I can go R to (4,5) as I thought.\n\nThen for the answer, I can list up to turn 6 or 7.\n\nBut the format might expect a sequence.\n\nSince it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but output the actions starting from t1.\n\nI think I should output a few actions.\n\nPerhaps 5 turns: from turn 3 to turn 7.\n\nt1=3, so turns 3,4,5,6,7.\n\nIn my plan:\n\nTurn 3: L\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nNow turn 6: from (3,5), I can choose to go R to (4,5)\n\nThen turn 7: from (4,5), I can go R to (5,5) or U to (4,6), etc.\n\nBut to be specific, say go R to (5,5) on turn 7? But I need to list.\n\nSince after turn 5, I have choices, but for the sequence, I can define a path.\n\nTo avoid being verbose, I can list until the first food is eaten and a safe move.\n\nBut I think for this, I'll go with L on turn 3.\n\nBut earlier I thought only two choices, L or R, and L seems better.\n\nWhat about moving down or something? On turn 3, from (4,3), I can only L or R, U and D invalid.\n\nU obstacle, D invalid direction.\n\nSo only L or R.\n\nI think L is better.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 3: L\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nNow for turn 6, let's say move R to (4,5)\n\nThen turn 7: move R to (5,5)\n\nBut (5,5) is near (5,6) obstacle, but ok.\n\nI can go to (4,6) or something, but let's not complicate.\n\nFor the answer, I'll list turns 3 to 6.\n\nThe format says \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" so I can list multiple.\n\nPerhaps 4 actions: turns 3,4,5,6.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 3: L\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: R\n\nBut on turn 6, moving R to (4,5) is from (3,5), yes.\n\nThen I can stop or continue.\n\nSince it's to show the plan.\n\nI think this is fine.\n</think>\nTo maximize the snake's score and ensure long-term survival, I evaluated possible moves 5+ turns ahead, considering food locations, life spans, obstacles, and movement constraints. The snake is currently at position (4,3) with direction Up, and the grid has borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, with internal obstacles at (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), and (6,3). All food is positive: (3,5) with life span 7 (disappears after turn 9), (2,2) with life span 7 (disappears after turn 9), and (6,4) with life span 8 (disappears after turn 10).\n\n### Key Considerations:\n- **Immediate Moves (Turn 3)**: From (4,3), moving Up to (4,4) is blocked by an obstacle, and moving Down is invalid due to the \"no instant reverse\" rule (current direction Up). Thus, only Left to (3,3) or Right to (5,3) are possible.\n- **Food Prioritization**: \n  - (3,5) can be reached safely in 2 moves (e.g., via (3,3) and (3,4)) and eaten on turn 5, providing +1 score and growth.\n  - (6,4) can be reached in 2 moves via (5,3) and (5,4), but the area near (6,4) has risks (e.g., obstacle at (6,3) and potential dead ends). Eating here on turn 5 is possible, but future mobility is limited.\n  - (2,2) is reachable but requires navigating near obstacles (e.g., (2,4)) and may take longer, increasing risk with a shorter snake.\n- **Risk Assessment**: \n  - Moving Right to (5,3) and then to (6,4) risks trapping the snake later (e.g., at (6,5) or (6,6)) due to walls and obstacles, reducing survival chances.\n  - Moving Left to (3,3) allows quick access to (3,5) with fewer obstacles, better mobility after eating, and opportunities to reach other food later (e.g., (6,4) or (2,2)).\n- **Long-Term Survival**: After eating (3,5), the snake grows to length 3, and positions like (4,5) or (2,5) provide open space for evasion and future food collection. (3,5) has a life span that allows eating on turn 5 (before it disappears on turn 10), and (6,4) can be targeted later with its longer life span.\n- **5-Turn Plan**: The sequence below ensures eating (3,5) on turn 5, avoids all collisions, and sets up for further food collection:\n  - **Turn 3**: Move Left to (3,3) to avoid obstacles and position for (3,5).\n  - **Turn 4**: Move Up to (3,4) to approach (3,5) directly.\n  - **Turn 5**: Move Up to (3,5) to eat the food (+1 score, snake length increases to 3).\n  - **Turn 6**: Move Right to (4,5) to leave the congested area and head toward open space for future options (e.g., approaching (6,4)).\n  - **Turn 7+**: Beyond turn 6, the snake can be maneuvered toward (6,4) (e.g., via (5,5) and (5,4)) or other safe paths, but this sequence focuses on the critical first 4 actions for immediate safety and scoring.\n\n### Action Sequence (Turns 3 to 6):\n- Turn 3: Left (to (3,3))\n- Turn 4: Up (to (3,4))\n- Turn 5: Up (to (3,5), eat food)\n- Turn 6: Right (to (4,5))\n\nThis plan avoids all walls, obstacles, and body collisions. After turn 6, the snake is at (4,5) with direction Right, enabling moves to (5,5) or (4,6) for continued survival and food pursuit.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 3: L \\\\\nTurn 4: U \\\\\nTurn 5: U \\\\\nTurn 6: R\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 4, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since the borders are x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7. So the grid is from (0,0) to (7,7).\n\nWalls: Border cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Also, internal obstacles at (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3). So I must avoid these cells.\n\nSnake positions: Head at (3,3), and one body segment at (4,3). Since it's only two segments, the tail is at (4,3). Snake head direction is left, meaning it was moving left to get to (3,3) from (4,3). So current direction is L.\n\nFood items:\n- (3,5) with life span 6, value +1\n- (2,2) with life span 6, value +1\n- (6,4) with life span 7, value +1\n- (6,6) with life span 10, value +1\n\nAll food is positive, value +1, so no negative food here. Life span decreases each turn, so I need to consider how many turns they have left.\n\nCurrent turn is 4, so for (3,5): life span 6, will disappear after turn 4 + 6 = turn 10? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 4, it has 6 turns left, meaning it disappears after turn 9? Let's clarify.\n\nLife span: disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current. So at turn t, if life span is L, it will be there until turn t + L - 1? For example, at turn t, countdown is L. After turn t, countdown becomes L-1, and so on, until countdown 0, then it disappears at the end of that turn? The rule says: \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nI think it's better to think in terms of remaining life. At turn t, food has life_span L, meaning it will disappear after L more turns, so it is present on turns t, t+1, ..., t+L-1, and gone at turn t+L.\n\nFor (3,5): at turn 4, life span 6, so present on turns 4,5,6,7,8,9 (6 turns), gone at turn 10.\n\nSimilarly, (2,2): life span 6, present turns 4-9.\n\n(6,4): life span 7, present turns 4-10.\n\n(6,6): life span 10, present turns 4-13.\n\nNow, snake is at [(3,3), (4,3)], head at (3,3), tail at (4,3). Direction left.\n\nI need to choose actions for multiple turns ahead, at least 5 turns. But the answer should start from turn 4 action, then turn 5, etc.\n\nSince I need to think 5+ turns ahead, I should simulate possible moves.\n\nFirst, possible actions from current position (3,3) with direction L.\n\nCurrent head direction is L, so I can move L (left), U (up), or D (down), but not R (right) because that would be instant reverse, which is not allowed. Rule: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\"\n\nCurrent direction is L, so opposite is R. So I cannot move R on this turn. So possible moves: L, U, D.\n\nNow, grid bounds: x=0 to 7, y=0 to 7, but walls include borders, so moving to x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 is wall collision, deadly.\n\nAlso internal obstacles.\n\nCurrent position: (3,3)\n\nMove left (L): to (2,3)\n\nIs (2,3) valid? Check walls: borders x=0, y=0, etc. (2,3) is within 1-6? x=2, y=3, x from 0-7, but x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x=2 is fine, y=3 fine. Internal obstacles: (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (5,6), (6,3). (2,3) not in that list, so should be safe, but need to check if it's occupied by snake or food.\n\nSnake positions: head at (3,3), body at (4,3), so (2,3) is empty. Food not at (2,3), so moving to (2,3) should be fine for now.\n\nBut after moving, the snake will grow only if it eats food, else tail moves.\n\nMove up (U): to (3,4)\n\n(3,4): not border, not internal obstacle? Internal obstacles: (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (5,6), (6,3). (3,4) not listed, so ok.\n\nMove down (D): to (3,2)\n\n(3,2): not border, not internal obstacle, ok.\n\nNow, I need to consider the food positions.\n\nFood at: (3,5), (2,2), (6,4), (6,6)\n\n(3,5) is above (3,4), so if I move up to (3,4), I can consider going to (3,5) later.\n\nSimilarly, (2,2) is below and left, etc.\n\nBut I have to think long-term, not just immediate.\n\nAlso, tail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it kills. But currently, tail is at (4,3), head at (3,3), so adjacent? Adjacent cells: (3,3) has neighbors (2,3), (4,3), (3,2), (3,4). Tail is at (4,3), which is adjacent to head. But is there food on tail? Tail is at (4,3), but food is at (3,5),(2,2),(6,4),(6,6), none at (4,3), so no food on tail. So no immediate danger.\n\nBut after moving, things change.\n\nNow, I need to plan multiple turns.\n\nSince snake is short, only 2 segments, I can grow safely if I eat food.\n\nBut I must avoid colliding with walls, obstacles, or myself.\n\nAlso, when I eat food, snake grows, so body gets longer, which might block paths later.\n\nBut now, with only one body segment, it's easy.\n\nLet me list possible actions for turn 4.\n\nPossible moves: L to (2,3), U to (3,4), D to (3,2)\n\nNow, from there, I need to think ahead.\n\nFirst, let's consider moving towards food.\n\nClosest food: (3,5) is at distance |3-3| + |5-3| = 0 + 2 = 2 Manhattan, but y-diff is 2, so two moves up.\n\n(2,2) is |3-2| + |3-2| = 1 + 1 = 2, so two moves: left and down, or down and left.\n\n(6,4) is |3-6| + |3-4| = 3 + 1 = 4\n\n(6,6) is |3-6| + |3-6| = 3 + 3 = 6\n\nSo (3,5) and (2,2) are closest.\n\n(3,5) requires moving up, but from (3,3), if I move U to (3,4), then next turn to (3,5) to eat.\n\nSimilarly, (2,2) requires moving left and down.\n\nBut I can't do both immediately.\n\nAlso, life spans: all have plenty of time, min 6 turns, so I can reach any within a few turns.\n\nBut I need to avoid risks.\n\nNow, let's think about the grid with obstacles.\n\nInternal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3)\n\n(2,4) is an obstacle, which might affect moving to (2,2) or (3,5).\n\n(4,4) is obstacle, near (3,3).\n\n(6,3) is obstacle, which might affect (6,4).\n\nNow, from (3,3), if I move U to (3,4), then (3,4) is free, but (4,4) is obstacle, so I can't go right, but I can go up to (3,5) or left to (2,4), but (2,4) is obstacle, so from (3,4), possible moves: U to (3,5), D to (3,3) but (3,3) is where body is or will be? After moving to (3,4), the snake positions will be head at (3,4), body at (3,3). Tail was at (4,3), but since no food eaten, tail moves away? When snake moves without eating, the tail moves forward, so from [(3,3),(4,3)], if move to (3,4), new positions: head to (3,4), and body from (4,3) to (3,3), so snake becomes [(3,4),(3,3)].\n\nThen tail is at (3,3), head at (3,4).\n\nThen I can move U to (3,5) to eat the food there.\n\nIf I move U to (3,5) from (3,4), then since I eat food, snake grows, so new head at (3,5), and body at (3,4), and tail stays, so snake becomes [(3,5),(3,4),(3,3)].\n\nThen length 3.\n\nSimilarly, if I move L to (2,3) from (3,3), new positions: head (2,3), body (3,3), tail gone? Without eating, tail moves: from [(3,3),(4,3)] move L to (2,3), new head (2,3), body from (4,3) to (3,3), so [(2,3),(3,3)].\n\nThen from there, I can move D to (2,2) to eat, since (2,2) is food.\n\n(2,2) is food, so move to (2,2) would eat it.\n\nBut is it safe? After moving to (2,3), snake is [(2,3),(3,3)], then move D to (2,2), eat food, so new head (2,2), body (2,3), and tail (3,3) stays? When eating, the tail doesn't move, so snake grows: head to (2,2), body segments: previous head (2,3) becomes body, and previous body (3,3) remains, so [(2,2),(2,3),(3,3)].\n\nThen length 3.\n\nNow, moving D from (3,3) to (3,2): new positions [(3,2),(3,3)].\n\nThen from there, (2,2) is at (2,2), so I could move L to (2,2)? From (3,2), move L to (2,2) to eat, but (2,2) is food.\n\nAfter move to (3,2), snake [(3,2),(3,3)], then move L to (2,2), eat, so new snake [(2,2),(3,2),(3,3)].\n\nAlso possible.\n\nBut (3,5) is up, so moving U might be better if I want to get it fast.\n\nBut I need to think long-term.\n\nAlso, there is tail reward danger to consider later.\n\nFirst, let's evaluate the options for turn 4.\n\nOption 1: Move U to (3,4)\n\nThen on turn 5, from (3,4), I can move U to (3,5) to eat the food.\n\nAfter turn 4 move U: snake positions: head (3,4), body (3,3)\n\nDirection: after moving U, head direction is U, so on turn 5, I can move U, L, R, but not D (down, opposite).\n\nFrom (3,4), possible moves:\n\nU to (3,5) - which has food\n\nL to (2,4) - but (2,4) is internal obstacle! Cannot move there.\n\nR to (4,4) - (4,4) is internal obstacle, cannot.\n\nD to (3,3) - but (3,3) is the body segment. After turn 4, snake is [(3,4),(3,3)], so (3,3) is occupied by body. If I move D to (3,3), head touches body, collision, death. So cannot move down.\n\nThe only possible move from (3,4) is U to (3,5), since L and R are obstacles, D is body.\n\nIs that right?\n\nGrid: (3,4) neighbors:\n\nUp: (3,5) - free, has food\n\nDown: (3,3) - occupied by body\n\nLeft: (2,4) - obstacle\n\nRight: (4,4) - obstacle\n\nSo yes, only possible move is U to (3,5).\n\nSo if I move U on turn 4, then on turn 5 I must move U to (3,5) to eat the food.\n\nThen after eating, snake becomes [(3,5),(3,4),(3,3)] with head direction U.\n\nNow, on turn 6, from (3,5), head at (3,5), direction U.\n\nPossible moves: U, L, R, not D (opposite).\n\nU to (3,6): y=6, not border? Borders y=0 and y=7, so y=6 is fine, no obstacle mentioned.\n\nInternal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3) — (3,6) not there, so should be free.\n\nBut is there food? Food at (2,2), (6,4), (6,6). (3,6) no food.\n\nL to (2,5): (2,5) not border, not obstacle? Obstacles: (2,4) is obstacle, but (2,5) is different cell. Not listed, so should be free.\n\nR to (4,5): similarly, (4,4) obstacle, but (4,5) not listed, should be free.\n\nD to (3,4) — but (3,4) is body segment, occupied, cannot move there.\n\nSo from (3,5), possible moves: U, L, R.\n\nNow, I need to think further.\n\nBut let's come back to turn 4 choices.\n\nIf I move U on turn 4, I am forced to move to (3,5) on turn 5 and eat it. Then I have a longer snake.\n\nBut is this good? I get +1 score, but now snake is longer, might be harder to maneuver.\n\nBut at turn 6, I can choose where to go.\n\nNow, other options for turn 4.\n\nMove L to (2,3) on turn 4.\n\nAfter move: snake [(2,3),(3,3)] with head direction L.\n\nThen on turn 5, from (2,3), possible moves: L, U, D, not R (opposite).\n\nL to (1,3): (1,3) — borders x=0, but x=1>0, not border. Internal obstacles: (1,4) is obstacle, but (1,3) not listed, should be free.\n\nU to (2,4) — but (2,4) is internal obstacle! Cannot.\n\nD to (2,2) — (2,2) has food, and is free? (2,2) not border, not obstacle, so yes.\n\nR to (3,3) — (3,3) is body segment, occupied, cannot.\n\nSo possible moves from (2,3): L to (1,3), D to (2,2), not U or R.\n\nU is to (2,4) obstacle, R to (3,3) body.\n\nSo can move L or D.\n\nIf I move D to (2,2), I eat the food, snake grows to [(2,2),(2,3),(3,3)].\n\nIf I move L to (1,3), then no eat, snake moves to [(1,3),(2,3)], tail gone, so [(1,3),(2,3)].\n\nBut moving to (2,2) might be better to eat food.\n\nSimilarly, move D on turn 4 to (3,2).\n\nAfter move: snake [(3,2),(3,3)] head direction D.\n\nThen turn 5, from (3,2), possible moves: D, L, R, not U (opposite).\n\nD to (3,1): not border, y=1>0, no obstacle, free.\n\nL to (2,2): (2,2) has food, free.\n\nR to (4,2): (4,2) not border, not obstacle (obstacles at y=4 or specific points, (4,4) but not (4,2)), so free.\n\nU to (3,3) — body, cannot.\n\nSo can move D, L, or R.\n\nIf move L to (2,2), eat food.\n\nNow, comparing the three choices:\n\n- Move U on turn 4: leads to eating (3,5) on turn 5, score +1, snake length 3.\n\n- Move L on turn 4: can eat (2,2) on turn 5 by moving D, or move L to (1,3) but no immediate food.\n\n- Move D on turn 4: can eat (2,2) on turn 5 by moving L.\n\nBut eating (2,2) might be similar to eating (3,5).\n\nNow, for long-term, I need to see which one allows better survival and more food access.\n\nAlso, after eating, the body might block paths.\n\nFirst, let's consider moving U on turn 4.\n\nTurn 4: move U to (3,4)\n\nTurn 5: move U to (3,5) eat food, snake now [(3,5),(3,4),(3,3)] head U.\n\nTurn 6: from (3,5), I can move U, L, or R.\n\nIf I move U to (3,6), then snake [(3,6),(3,5),(3,4)] , tail at (3,4)? Positions: head (3,6), body (3,5), body (3,4), so tail (3,4).\n\nNo food eaten, so tail moves? When no eat, tail moves away. After move to (3,6), previous positions: before move, snake was [(3,5),(3,4),(3,3)], after move U to (3,6), head to (3,6), body segments: (3,5) becomes body, (3,4) becomes next body, and (3,3) is tail, which moves away? When snake moves without eating, the head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to previous position of the segment ahead, and the tail is removed.\n\nStandard snake movement: when no eat, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so tail cell is vacated.\n\nIn this case, before move: segments: 0:head (3,5), 1:body (3,4), 2:tail (3,3)\n\nAfter move U to (3,6): new head (3,6), segment 1 moves to previous head position (3,5), segment 2 moves to previous segment 1 position (3,4), and tail (3,3) is removed, so new positions: [(3,6),(3,5),(3,4)]\n\nTail is now (3,4).\n\nIf I move L from (3,5) to (2,5), similarly.\n\nOr R to (4,5).\n\nNow, food available: (2,2), (6,4), (6,6)\n\n(2,2) is at (2,2), which is down and left.\n\n(6,4) is right and down, (6,6) up and right.\n\nFrom (3,5), moving to (3,6) might not be towards food.\n\n(3,6) has no food, and I need to go to other food.\n\nPerhaps move R to (4,5) to go towards (6,4) or (6,6).\n\nBut (4,4) is obstacle, so from (4,5), I can move R to (5,5), etc.\n\nBut let's think about the path.\n\nI should consider moving towards (2,2) first, since it has shorter life? All have similar life, but (2,2) might be easier to reach from here.\n\nFrom (3,5), to reach (2,2), I need to go left and down.\n\nBut from (3,5), if I move L to (2,5), then from (2,5), I can move D to (2,4), but (2,4) is obstacle! Cannot.\n\n(2,4) is internal obstacle, so from (2,5), I cannot move down to (2,4).\n\nFrom (2,5), possible moves: U to (2,6), D to (2,4) obstacle, L to (1,5), R to (3,5) which is body? After moving to (2,5), snake positions.\n\nIf on turn 6 I move L from (3,5) to (2,5), then new positions: head (2,5), body (3,5), body (3,4) — since after eating on turn 5, snake is [(3,5),(3,4),(3,3)], move L to (2,5), no eat, so new head (2,5), body to (3,5), and the tail (3,3) moves to (3,4)? Segments: before move: 0:(3,5), 1:(3,4), 2:(3,3)\n\nAfter move L to (2,5): new head (2,5), segment 1 moves to (3,5), segment 2 moves to (3,4), tail (3,3) removed, so snake [(2,5),(3,5),(3,4)]\n\nNow from (2,5), head at (2,5), direction L (since moved left).\n\nPossible moves: L, U, D, not R.\n\nL to (1,5): free, I assume.\n\nU to (2,6): free.\n\nD to (2,4): obstacle, cannot.\n\nR to (3,5): body, occupied, cannot.\n\nSo only L or U.\n\nIf I go L to (1,5), then I can go down later, but (2,4) blocked, so to reach (2,2), I need to go around, like to (1,5) to (1,4) or something, but (1,4) is obstacle? Internal obstacles: (1,4) is listed, so (1,4) is obstacle, cannot move there.\n\nSo from (1,5), I can move U to (1,6), D to (1,4) obstacle, L to (0,5) but x=0 is border wall, cannot, R to (2,5) body, cannot.\n\nSo only U to (1,6), dead end or something.\n\nNot good.\n\nIf from (2,5) I move U to (2,6), then from (2,6) I can move to (2,7) but y=7 is border wall, or to (1,6) or (3,6), but (1,6) might be free, etc., but not towards food.\n\nSo from (3,5), moving L to (2,5) seems to lead to a trap because I cannot go down to (2,4) due to obstacle.\n\nTherefore, it might be better to move R or U from (3,5).\n\nMove U to (3,6): then from (3,6), I can move to other places.\n\nBut (3,6) is near top, y=6, borders at y=7.\n\nFood at (6,4) and (6,6) are on the right.\n\nMove R from (3,5) to (4,5).\n\n(4,5) is free? Not obstacle, not border.\n\nThen from (4,5), head direction R.\n\nPossible moves: R, U, D, not L (opposite).\n\nR to (5,5): free.\n\nU to (4,6): free.\n\nD to (4,4): but (4,4) is internal obstacle! Cannot.\n\nL to (3,5): body, cannot.\n\nSo only R or U.\n\nMove R to (5,5), then to (6,5) or something.\n\nBut (6,4) is food at (6,4), so from (5,5) I can move D to (5,4), then to (6,4).\n\nBut let's not get too deep.\n\nBack to turn 4 choice.\n\nIf I move U on turn 4, I eat (3,5) on turn 5, but then I might be stuck in the upper left with obstacles, and it's hard to reach the right side where other food is.\n\nFor example, from (3,5), to go to (6,4), I need to go right, but there is obstacle at (4,4) and (2,4), so I have to go up or down to avoid.\n\nFrom (3,5), I can move R to (4,5), then from (4,5) move R to (5,5), then from (5,5) move D to (5,4), then to (6,4).\n\n(5,4) free? No obstacle listed, (6,3) obstacle but (5,4) different.\n\nThen from (5,4) to (6,4) eat food.\n\nSimilarly, from (5,5) I can go to (5,6) but (5,6) is obstacle, so cannot.\n\n(5,6) is internal obstacle.\n\nSo from (5,5), move D to (5,4) is possible.\n\nBut it takes several turns.\n\nNow, alternative: if I don't move U on turn 4, I can go for (2,2) first.\n\nFor example, move L on turn 4 to (2,3).\n\nThen turn 5, from (2,3), I can move D to (2,2) to eat food.\n\nAfter turn 4 move L: snake [(2,3),(3,3)]\n\nTurn 5 move D to (2,2) eat, snake grows to [(2,2),(2,3),(3,3)] head direction D (since moved down).\n\nThen turn 6, from (2,2), head at (2,2), direction D.\n\nPossible moves: D, L, R, not U.\n\nD to (2,1): not border, free.\n\nL to (1,2): free.\n\nR to (3,2): free? (3,2) not occupied, no obstacle.\n\nU to (2,3) body, cannot.\n\nNow, food at (3,5), (6,4), (6,6).\n\n(3,5) is up, but to go there, I need to go to (3,3) or something, but (3,3) is body.\n\nFrom (2,2), I can move R to (3,2), then U to (3,3) but (3,3) is body, cannot.\n\nAfter turn 5, snake is [(2,2),(2,3),(3,3)], so (3,3) is tail.\n\nOn turn 6, if I move R to (3,2), then new positions: head (3,2), body (2,2), body (2,3), and tail (3,3) removed? Move to (3,2) no eat, so head to (3,2), segment 1 to (2,2), segment 2 to (2,3), tail (3,3) removed, so snake [(3,2),(2,2),(2,3)]\n\nTail at (2,3).\n\nThen from (3,2), I can move U to (3,3), but (3,3) was just removed, so it's free now? When tail moves, the cell is vacated, so (3,3) is empty.\n\nMove U to (3,3) from (3,2).\n\n(3,3) is free, no problem.\n\nThen I can go to (3,4) etc. to reach (3,5).\n\nBut (3,5) is food, life span 6, at turn 4, present until turn 9, so on turn 6, it has 4 turns left? Turn 4,5,6,7,8,9 present, at turn 6, it has 4 turns left including current? Remaining life at turn t: for (3,5) life span 6 at turn 4, so at turn 6, it has been 2 turns, so 4 turns left, present until turn 9.\n\nSimilarly, others have more time.\n\n(6,6) life span 10, until turn 13.\n\nSo time to reach (3,5) from here.\n\nFrom (2,2), if I move R to (3,2) on turn 6, then turn 7 move U to (3,3), then turn 8 move U to (3,4), turn 9 move U to (3,5) to eat on turn 9, just before it disappears.\n\nBut on turn 9, it is still present, yes.\n\nBut is (3,4) free? After moving to (3,3) on turn 7, snake positions.\n\nLet's simulate.\n\nTurn 6: from (2,2) move R to (3,2), snake becomes [(3,2),(2,2),(2,3)] head direction R.\n\nTurn 7: from (3,2) move U to (3,3), no eat, snake: head (3,3), body (3,2), body (2,2), tail (2,3) removed, so [(3,3),(3,2),(2,2)]\n\nHead direction U.\n\nTurn 8: move U to (3,4), no eat, snake: head (3,4), body (3,3), body (3,2), tail (2,2) removed, so [(3,4),(3,3),(3,2)]\n\nTurn 9: move U to (3,5) eat food, snake grows to [(3,5),(3,4),(3,3),(3,2)]\n\nSo I can eat it on turn 9.\n\nSimilarly, from other positions.\n\nBut this is if I go for (2,2) first.\n\nNow, back to turn 4, if I move D to (3,2), similar to moving L but down.\n\nMove D on turn 4 to (3,2), then turn 5 move L to (2,2) eat, same as above, snake [(2,2),(3,2),(3,3)] etc.\n\nThen same as above.\n\nBut when I move D on turn 4, from (3,2) on turn 5, I can also move R or D instead of L to (2,2).\n\nFor example, move R to (4,2) or D to (3,1), but that might delay eating.\n\nSince (2,2) is close, it's better to eat it soon.\n\nNow, compare to moving U first: if I move U on turn 4, I eat (3,5) on turn 5, then on turn 6 I can start moving towards other food.\n\nFor example, from (3,5) on turn 6, move R to (4,5), then turn 7 move R to (5,5), turn 8 move D to (5,4), turn 9 move R to (6,4) to eat (6,4) on turn 9.\n\n(6,4) life span 7 at turn 4, present until turn 10, so on turn 9 ok.\n\nThen I have eaten two food.\n\nIf I go for (2,2) first, I eat on turn 5, then go to (3,5) eat on turn 9, and (6,4) might be eaten later.\n\nBut (6,4) is farther.\n\nAlso, there is (6,6) with longer life.\n\nBut I need to avoid risks.\n\nAnother thing: the internal obstacle at (6,3), which might affect moving to (6,4).\n\n(6,4) is food, and (6,3) is obstacle, so to reach (6,4), I can come from left, up, or down, but not from (6,3).\n\nSimilarly, (6,6) is above.\n\nNow, let's think about the tail reward danger for the future.\n\nCurrently, snake is short, no issue.\n\nBut after eating, when snake is longer, I need to be careful not to have head adjacent to tail with food on tail.\n\nBut food can spawn under body, but here food positions are given, no food under snake now.\n\nSnake is at (3,3) and (4,3), food not there.\n\nNow, for long-term survival, since the grid has obstacles, I need to keep space to move.\n\nThe upper left has obstacles at (1,4), (2,4), (4,4), so the area around (3,3) to (3,5) might be a bit constrained.\n\nLower left has (2,2) free.\n\nRight side has (6,3) obstacle, but (6,4) and (6,6) are food.\n\nPerhaps it's better to go for (2,2) first, then I can have more freedom to move down or right.\n\nIf I go up to (3,5), I might be cornered.\n\nFor example, from (3,5), after eating, the only ways out are left or right, but left to (2,5) is dead end because of (2,4) obstacle and (1,4) obstacle, so I can only go right to (4,5), etc., as I thought.\n\nFrom (2,2), after eating, I can go down to (2,1) or left to (1,2) or right to (3,2), etc., more options.\n\nAlso, (6,4) and (6,6) are on the right, so from the bottom, I can go right and up.\n\nMoreover, if I move U on turn 4, I am forced to eat (3,5) on turn 5, but then I have a longer snake immediately, which might make it harder to navigate through narrow spaces.\n\nWith length 3, it's still short, but the body at (3,4) and (3,3) blocks the column.\n\nWhereas if I eat (2,2), the snake is at (2,2),(2,3),(3,3), which is L-shaped, might be better for movement.\n\nBut both are possible.\n\nAnother point: the food at (6,6) has long life, so I can get it later.\n\nBut I need to maximize score, so I should eat as many as possible.\n\nLet's list the food and their \"expiration\" turns:\n\n- (3,5): present turns 4 to 9, disappear turn 10\n\n- (2,2): present turns 4 to 9, disappear turn 10\n\n- (6,4): present turns 4 to 10, disappear turn 11\n\n- (6,6): present turns 4 to 13, disappear turn 14\n\nCurrent turn 4.\n\nIf I go for (2,2) first:\n\nTurn 4: move L to (2,3)  // or D, but let's say L\n\nThen turn 5: move D to (2,2) eat, score +1, snake [(2,2),(2,3),(3,3)] head D\n\nTurn 6: from (2,2), move R to (3,2)  // to go towards (3,5)\n\nAfter move: snake [(3,2),(2,2),(2,3)]\n\nTurn 7: move U to (3,3)  // (3,3) is free now? After turn 6, positions [(3,2),(2,2),(2,3)], so (3,3) empty.\n\nMove U to (3,3), no eat, snake [(3,3),(3,2),(2,2)] head U\n\nTurn 8: move U to (3,4), no eat, snake [(3,4),(3,3),(3,2)]\n\nTurn 9: move U to (3,5) eat, score +1, snake [(3,5),(3,4),(3,3),(3,2)]\n\nNow I have eaten two food, length 4.\n\nThen I can go for (6,4) or (6,6).\n\nFrom (3,5), I can move R to (4,5) on turn 10, but (3,5) is eaten on turn 9, so on turn 10 from (3,5), move R to (4,5), no eat, snake [(4,5),(3,5),(3,4),(3,3)]  // tail (3,3) removed? Move to (4,5) no eat, so head (4,5), body (3,5), body (3,4), body (3,3), tail (3,2) removed, so [(4,5),(3,5),(3,4),(3,3)]\n\nTurn 11: move R to (5,5), no eat, snake [(5,5),(4,5),(3,5),(3,4)]\n\nTurn 12: move D to (5,4), no eat, snake [(5,4),(5,5),(4,5),(3,5)]\n\nTurn 13: move R to (6,4) eat, but (6,4) disappears at turn 11? (6,4) life span 7 at turn 4, present turns 4 to 10, gone at turn 11.\n\nAt turn 13, it is gone, so I cannot eat it.\n\nLife span: at turn 4, life span 7, so it is present for 7 turns: turns 4,5,6,7,8,9,10, gone after turn 10, so on turn 11, not present.\n\nTurn 13 is too late.\n\nSimilarly, (6,4) can be eaten until turn 10.\n\nIn the above, I reach (6,4) on turn 13, but it's gone.\n\nFrom (3,5) on turn 9, I can go directly to (6,4) but it's far.\n\nFrom (3,5) turn 9, to (6,4), minimum 3 moves: right, right, down, but with obstacles.\n\nFor example, turn 9: from (3,5) move R to (4,5)\n\nTurn 10: from (4,5) move R to (5,5)\n\nTurn 11: from (5,5) move D to (5,4)  // but (6,4) is gone at turn 11, so on turn 11, (6,4) not there.\n\nTurn 10 is the last turn to eat (6,4).\n\nFrom (3,5) on turn 9, I can move to (4,5) on turn 9? Turn 9 I am at (3,5), move R to (4,5) on turn 9, but that's the move after eating, on turn 9 I just moved to (3,5) and ate, so the move is for turn 9 action, but after eating, the position is set.\n\nLet's clarify turn timing.\n\nOn turn 5 I ate (3,5), so on turn 9, I am at (3,5) only if I stayed, but I moved.\n\nIn the sequence where I ate (2,2) first, on turn 9 I am moving to (3,5) to eat it.\n\nThen on turn 10, I can be at (3,5), and move towards (6,4).\n\nBut (6,4) disappears after turn 10, so on turn 10, it is still present? Disappears after N turns, so at turn t, food with life span L is present until turn t + L - 1.\n\nAt turn 4, life span 7, present turns 4 to 10? Turn t + L - 1 = 4+7-1=10, so present on turn 10, gone at turn 11.\n\nSimilarly, on turn 10, (6,4) is present.\n\nFrom (3,5) on turn 10, I can move R to (4,5), but (6,4) is at (6,4), which is two steps right and one down from (4,5), but from (4,5) to (6,4) requires (5,5) to (6,4) or something, but (5,4) to (6,4).\n\nFrom (3,5) turn 10: move to (4,5)\n\nThen turn 11: but on turn 11, (6,4) is gone, so I can't eat it.\n\nTo eat (6,4) on turn 10, I need to be at (6,4) on turn 10.\n\nBut from (3,5) on turn 9, after eating, I am at (3,5) at end of turn 9.\n\nOn turn 10, I can move directly to a cell adjacent to (6,4) but not to (6,4) in one move from (3,5).\n\nMinimum distance: (3,5) to (6,4) is |3-6| + |5-4| = 3+1=4 moves.\n\nI need to be at (6,4) by turn 10.\n\nTurn 10 is the last turn.\n\nFrom turn 9 position (3,5), I can move on turn 10 to (4,5), but not to (6,4).\n\nSo impossible to eat (6,4) from there on turn 10.\n\nTherefore, if I eat (3,5) late, I might miss (6,4).\n\nSimilarly, if I eat (3,5) early, I can reach (6,4) on time.\n\nLet's go back to the first option: move U on turn 4 to (3,4), then turn 5 move U to (3,5) eat.\n\nSnake at turn 5: [(3,5),(3,4),(3,3)]\n\nTurn 6: from (3,5), move R to (4,5)  // to go towards (6,4)\n\nAfter move: no eat, snake [(4,5),(3,5),(3,4)]  // tail (3,3) removed\n\nTurn 7: move R to (5,5), snake [(5,5),(4,5),(3,5)]\n\nTurn 8: move D to (5,4), snake [(5,4),(5,5),(4,5)]\n\nTurn 9: move R to (6,4) eat, score +1, snake [(6,4),(5,4),(5,5),(4,5)]\n\n(6,4) is present on turn 9, yes.\n\nThen I have eaten two food.\n\nNow, I can go for (6,6) or (2,2), but (2,2) disappears on turn 10, so from (6,4) on turn 9, to (2,2) is far, |6-2| + |4-2| = 4+2=6 moves, not possible by turn 10.\n\n(2,2) present until turn 9, gone turn 10.\n\nTurn 9 I am at (6,4), (2,2) is at (2,2), cannot reach in one move.\n\nSo (2,2) will be missed if I go this route.\n\nSimilarly, (6,6) is still available.\n\nFrom (6,4) on turn 9, I can move U to (6,5) or something to go to (6,6).\n\n(6,6) is at (6,6), from (6,4) I can move U to (6,5) turn 10, then U to (6,6) turn 11 to eat.\n\n(6,6) present until turn 13, so ok.\n\nBut I missed (2,2).\n\nIf I go for (2,2) first, I can eat (2,2) and (3,5), but miss (6,4) because I eat (3,5) on turn 9 and (6,4) gone on turn 11, but from (3,5) on turn 9, I can't reach (6,4) by turn 10.\n\nIn the sequence where I eat (2,2) first, on turn 9 I eat (3,5), so on turn 9 I am at (3,5), and (6,4) is present on turn 9 and 10.\n\nFrom (3,5) on turn 9, I can move towards (6,4), but as before, I can reach (6,4) in 4 moves, but turn 10 is the last chance.\n\nOn turn 9: at (3,5), move to (4,5)\n\nOn turn 10: at (4,5), move to (5,5) or to (5,4), but (6,4) is adjacent to (5,4) or (6,5), etc.\n\nFrom (4,5) on turn 10, I can move to (5,5), but not to (6,4) directly.\n\n(5,4) is adjacent to (6,4), but from (4,5) to (5,4) is diagonal? No, moves are U/D/L/R.\n\nFrom (4,5), I can move D to (4,4) but (4,4) obstacle, cannot.\n\nMove R to (5,5), then from (5,5) move D to (5,4), but on turn 11, (6,4) gone.\n\nSo on turn 10, from (4,5), I cannot reach (6,4) in one move; it's two moves away.\n\nThus, I cannot eat (6,4) if I eat (3,5) on turn 9.\n\nTherefore, to eat both (3,5) and (6,4), I need to eat (3,5) early and then go to (6,4).\n\nSimilarly, (2,2) can be eaten separately.\n\nBut (2,2) and (3,5) are both in the left, but with obstacles, it's hard to eat both if I delay.\n\nIf I eat (3,5) on turn 5, then I can eat (6,4) on turn 9, as in the first sequence.\n\nThen (2,2) is available until turn 9, but from (6,4) on turn 9, I can't reach (2,2) by turn 9 or 10.\n\nDistance too far.\n\nSo I can only eat two of the three short-life foods.\n\n(6,6) has long life, so I can get it later.\n\nBut I need to choose which two to eat.\n\nNow, the food at (6,6) is also there.\n\nBut let's see the map.\n\nPerhaps I can eat (2,2) and then (6,4), but (6,4) expires later.\n\n(2,2) expires turn 10, (6,4) turn 11.\n\nIf I eat (2,2) early, then go to (6,4).\n\nFor example, move L on turn 4 to (2,3), turn 5 move D to (2,2) eat.\n\nSnake at (2,2) on turn 5.\n\nThen from there, go to (6,4).\n\nBut (6,4) at (6,4), from (2,2) to (6,4) is |2-6| + |2-4| = 4+2=6 moves.\n\nOn turn 5, I am at (2,2), (6,4) present until turn 10.\n\nSo I have from turn 6 to turn 10 to reach it, 5 turns for 6 moves? Minimum 6 moves, but I can do it in 6 moves.\n\nTurn 6: from (2,2) move R to (3,2)  // as before\n\nTurn 7: move R to (4,2)  // (4,2) free\n\nTurn 8: move R to (5,2)  // free\n\nTurn 9: move U to (5,3)  // but (6,3) is obstacle, so not to (6,3)\n\nFrom (5,2) move U to (5,3), then turn 10 move R to (6,3) but (6,3) obstacle, cannot.\n\nMove to (5,3) then to (5,4), then to (6,4).\n\nTurn 9: from (5,2) move U to (5,3)\n\nTurn 10: from (5,3) move U to (5,4)  // (5,4) free\n\nBut (6,4) is at (6,4), from (5,4) I can move R to (6,4) on turn 11, but turn 11 (6,4) gone.\n\nOn turn 10, I am at (5,4), I can move R to (6,4) on turn 10 to eat, since (6,4) present on turn 10.\n\nYes!\n\nFrom (5,4) to (6,4) is adjacent.\n\nSo sequence:\n\nTurn 5: at (2,2) after eating\n\nTurn 6: move R to (3,2)  // snake [(3,2),(2,2),(2,3)]  // after move, positions\n\nAfter turn 5: snake [(2,2),(2,3),(3,3)]\n\nTurn 6 move R to (3,2): head to (3,2), body to (2,2), body to (2,3), tail (3,3) removed, so [(3,2),(2,2),(2,3)]\n\nTurn 7: move R to (4,2), no eat, snake [(4,2),(3,2),(2,2)]  // tail (2,3) removed\n\nTurn 8: move R to (5,2), snake [(5,2),(4,2),(3,2)]\n\nTurn 9: move U to (5,3), snake [(5,3),(5,2),(4,2)]\n\nTurn 10: move R to (6,4)? From (5,3) to (6,4) is not adjacent; (6,4) is right and up, but moves are only orthogonal.\n\nFrom (5,3), I can move R to (6,3) but (6,3) obstacle, cannot.\n\nMove U to (5,4), then from (5,4) to (6,4).\n\nBut on turn 10, I need to be at (6,4).\n\nFrom (5,3) on turn 9, I move U to (5,4) on turn 9? Turn 9 action.\n\nTurn 9: from position at turn 9 start.\n\nAfter turn 8, at (5,2), head (5,2), direction R.\n\nTurn 9: move U to (5,3) or other.\n\nIf move U to (5,3), then on turn 10, from (5,3), move U to (5,4), then on turn 10 I am at (5,4), not (6,4).\n\nThen move R to (6,4) on turn 11, but (6,4) gone.\n\nIf on turn 9 from (5,2) I move directly to (5,4)? No, only one move per turn.\n\nFrom (5,2) to (5,4) is two moves: U to (5,3), then U to (5,4).\n\nBut (5,3) to (5,4) is move U.\n\nBut on turn 10, I can be at (5,4), then move to (6,4) on turn 11 too late.\n\nTo reach (6,4) by turn 10, I need to be at a cell adjacent to (6,4) on turn 9, then move to it on turn 10.\n\nAdjacent cells to (6,4): (6,5), (6,3), (5,4), (7,4)\n\nBut (6,3) obstacle, (7,4) x=7 border wall, not valid.\n\n(6,5) and (5,4) are possible.\n\nSo I need to be at (6,5) or (5,4) on turn 9 to move to (6,4) on turn 10.\n\nFrom (2,2) on turn 5, to (5,4) or (6,5) on turn 9.\n\nFor example, to (5,4): from (2,2) to (5,4) is |2-5| + |2-4| = 3+2=5 moves.\n\nTurn 6,7,8,9,10.\n\nOn turn 10 I move to (6,4), but I need to be at (5,4) on turn 9.\n\nTurn 6: move from (2,2) to (3,2) or (2,1) etc.\n\nLet's find a path.\n\nTurn 6: from (2,2) move R to (3,2)  // as before\n\nTurn 7: move R to (4,2)\n\nTurn 8: move U to (4,3)  // (4,3) free? Not obstacle, but snake body? At turn 8, snake positions depend.\n\nAfter turn 7: from turn 6 [(3,2),(2,2),(2,3)]? Let's track.\n\nTurn 5: after eating (2,2), snake [(2,2),(2,3),(3,3)]\n\nTurn 6: move R to (3,2), no eat, head to (3,2), body to (2,2), body to (2,3), tail (3,3) removed, so [(3,2),(2,2),(2,3)]\n\nTurn 7: move R to (4,2), head to (4,2), body to (3,2), body to (2,2), tail (2,3) removed, so [(4,2),(3,2),(2,2)]\n\nTurn 8: move U to (4,3), head to (4,3), body to (4,2), body to (3,2), tail (2,2) removed, so [(4,3),(4,2),(3,2)]\n\nTurn 9: move U to (4,4) but (4,4) obstacle, cannot.\n\nMove R to (5,3) from (4,3)? (5,3) not adjacent; from (4,3), move R to (5,3)? (4,3) to (5,3) is R, yes, x+1.\n\n(5,3) free? No obstacle, (6,3) obstacle but (5,3) different.\n\nSo move R to (5,3) on turn 9.\n\nThen snake [(5,3),(4,3),(4,2)]\n\nTurn 10: move U to (5,4) or to (6,4)? From (5,3) to (6,4) not adjacent.\n\nMove U to (5,4), then on turn 10 I am at (5,4), can move R to (6,4) on turn 11, late.\n\nFrom (5,3) on turn 9, I can move U to (5,4) on turn 9? Turn 9 action from (4,3) to (5,3), so on turn 9 end at (5,3).\n\nThen turn 10 move U to (5,4), then not at (6,4).\n\nTo reach (5,4) by turn 9.\n\nFrom (2,2) on turn 5, to (5,4) in 4 moves: for example, turn 6: move R to (3,2), turn 7: move R to (4,2), turn 8: move U to (4,3), turn 9: move U to (4,4) but (4,4) obstacle.\n\nCannot go directly.\n\nMove turn 6: move D to (2,1), then turn 7 move R to (3,1), etc., but longer.\n\nIt seems difficult to reach (6,4) by turn 10 from (2,2) on turn 5 with the obstacles.\n\nThe path is blocked by obstacles.\n\nFor example, from (4,2), I can go to (4,3), then to (5,3), then to (5,4), then to (6,4), but that takes to turn 10 for (5,4), then turn 11 for (6,4).\n\nMinimum 5 moves from (2,2) to (6,4): e.g. (2,2)->(3,2)->(4,2)->(5,2)->(5,3)->(5,4)->(6,4) 6 moves, or (2,2)->(3,2)->(4,2)->(4,3)->(5,3)->(5,4)->(6,4) also 6 moves.\n\nFrom turn 5 to turn 10 is 5 moves (turns 6,7,8,9,10), so 5 moves, I can be at (5,4) on turn 10, but not at (6,4).\n\nOn turn 10, I can move to (6,4) from (5,4), but only if I am at (5,4) on turn 9.\n\nBut to be at (5,4) on turn 9, I need to start from (2,2) on turn 5, arrive at (5,4) on turn 9, which is 4 moves: turns 6,7,8,9.\n\n4 moves: for example, (2,2) -> (3,2) turn 6, (4,2) turn 7, (5,2) turn 8, (5,3) turn 9, not (5,4).\n\n(2,2) -> (2,1) turn 6, (3,1) turn 7, (4,1) turn 8, (5,1) turn 9, then to (5,2) etc, not better.\n\nSo I cannot reach (5,4) by turn 9 from (2,2) in 4 moves; it's at least 5 moves to (5,4), so on turn 10 at (5,4), then turn 11 to (6,4) late.\n\nTherefore, it's not possible to eat both (2,2) and (6,4) because of the distance and obstacles.\n\nSimilarly, eating (3,5) and (6,4) is possible, as in the first sequence, but missing (2,2).\n\nEating (2,2) and (3,5) is possible, missing (6,4).\n\nOr eating only one and the others, but better to eat two.\n\n(6,6) is still there with long life.\n\nBut for now, I think the best is to eat (3,5) and (6,4), as they are on the way to each other.\n\nThen I can go for (6,6) later.\n\nMoreover, in the beginning, moving U on turn 4 allows me to eat (3,5) quickly and then head east.\n\nIf I move L or D, I eat (2,2) but then I might not reach (6,4).\n\nSo I think moving U on turn 4 is better.\n\nThen for turn 5, I must move U to (3,5).\n\nThen for turn 6, I should move R to (4,5) to go towards (6,4).\n\nThen continue.\n\nBut I need to output actions for multiple turns, at least 5 turns ahead.\n\nThe answer format should be actions from turn 4 onwards.\n\nSo let's plan the sequence.\n\nTurn 4: move U to (3,4)\n\nTurn 5: move U to (3,5) eat food\n\nTurn 6: move R to (4,5)\n\nTurn 7: move R to (5,5)\n\nTurn 8: move D to (5,4)\n\nTurn 9: move R to (6,4) eat food\n\nNow, on turn 9, I eat (6,4), so snake grows.\n\nThen for turn 10, from (6,4), I can move U to (6,5) to go towards (6,6).\n\n(6,6) is at (6,6), from (6,4) move U to (6,5) turn 10, then U to (6,6) turn 11 eat.\n\n(6,6) present until turn 13, so ok.\n\nBut I need to think about the direction and no reverse.\n\nAfter turn 9, head at (6,4), direction R (since moved right).\n\nTurn 10: move U to (6,5), not opposite, so ok.\n\nThen turn 11: move U to (6,6) eat.\n\nBut after that, I need to survive, but no more food, so I can wander.\n\nBut the grid has obstacles, so I need to avoid dead ends.\n\nFor example, after (6,6), I can move L or D, but (6,5) might be body, etc.\n\nBut let's not plan too far; I think 5 turns is enough for now, but since I need to specify actions, I can do up to turn 9 or so.\n\nThe think 5+ turns ahead, but output can be for a few turns.\n\nBut in the answer, it should start from turn 4 action.\n\nAlso, for turn 4, moving U seems good.\n\nBut earlier I considered moving L or D, but with the time constraints, U is better to catch (3,5) and then (6,4).\n\nIf I move D on turn 4, I can eat (2,2) on turn 5, but then I miss (6,4), and (3,5) I can eat on turn 9, but alone.\n\nWith U, I eat two food.\n\nSimilarly, (2,2) is symmetric, but (6,4) is on the right, so from left, it's farther.\n\nSo I think U is the choice.\n\nNow, about the tail reward danger: in this sequence, no issue, since no food on tail.\n\nAlso, the food at (6,6) I can get later.\n\nSo for the answer, I'll go with moving U on turn 4.\n\nThen actions:\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: U (to eat (3,5))\n\nTurn 6: R (to (4,5))\n\nTurn 7: R (to (5,5))\n\nTurn 8: D (to (5,4))\n\nTurn 9: R (to (6,4) eat)\n\nBut I need to output for turn 4,5,6,... probably at least 5 actions.\n\nSince turn 4 to turn 8 or 9.\n\nBut let's see the direction.\n\nOn turn 6, from (3,5) moving R to (4,5), direction R.\n\nTurn 7, from (4,5) moving R to (5,5), direction R.\n\nTurn 8, from (5,5) moving D to (5,4), not opposite, so ok.\n\nTurn 9, from (5,4) moving R to (6,4), direction R.\n\nAll good.\n\nAfter that, I can continue to (6,6).\n\nBut for the answer, I think 5 actions are sufficient.\n\nThe core is to decide turn 4 action.\n\nPerhaps I should consider moving D or L to avoid potential risk, but in this case, moving U seems fine.\n\nAnother point: when I move to (3,4) on turn 4, the cell (3,4) is free, no issue.\n\nSimilarly, no food there.\n\nSo I think it's safe.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while prioritizing long-term survival, I analyzed the current state and planned moves 5+ turns ahead. The key considerations include:\n- Eating positive food (+1 score, snake growth) while avoiding collisions with walls, obstacles, or the snake's body.\n- Accounting for food life spans: (3,5) disappears after turn 9, (2,2) after turn 9, (6,4) after turn 10, and (6,6) after turn 13. All food must be eaten before their expiration.\n- Avoiding the forced path after moving up on turn 4, which allows efficient access to (3,5) and then (6,4), missing (2,2) due to distance but securing two foods.\n- Ensuring no tail reward danger (no food under the tail) and no instant reverse moves.\n- Navigating around internal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3).\n\nThe chosen path:\n- **Turn 4 (current turn)**: Move up (U) to (3,4). This positions the snake to eat (3,5) next turn and avoids dead ends. Moving left (L) or down (D) would lead to eating (2,2) but risk missing (6,4) due to distance and obstacles.\n- **Turn 5**: Move up (U) to (3,5) to eat the food (life span 6, eaten on turn 5 before expiration). Snake grows to length 3.\n- **Turn 6**: Move right (R) to (4,5) to begin heading toward (6,4). This avoids the obstacle at (4,4) and opens a path east.\n- **Turn 7**: Move right (R) to (5,5), continuing toward (6,4) while staying clear of obstacles.\n- **Turn 8**: Move down (D) to (5,4) to approach (6,4) from above, avoiding the obstacle at (6,3).\n- **Turn 9**: Move right (R) to (6,4) to eat the food (life span 7, eaten on turn 9 before expiration). Snake grows to length 4.\n\nThis sequence eats two foods ((3,5) and (6,4)) by turn 9. (2,2) is missed but is less accessible without compromising (6,4). (6,6) can be targeted after turn 9 (e.g., move up twice) due to its longer life span. Survival is ensured by avoiding collisions and maintaining maneuverability.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 4: U\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: R\nTurn 7: R\nTurn 8: D\nTurn 9: R\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 5, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think? Let me confirm the coordinates.\n\nWalls: Border cells x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So that means the grid goes from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7, but the walls occupy those, so the snake can only be on cells from (1,1) to (6,6). But let's list the internal obstacles too: [(5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3)].\n\nSnake positions: head at (3,4), then body at (3,3). So the snake is only 2 segments long right now. Head direction is Up, meaning it moved to (3,4) from below, so previous position was (3,3), and it moved up to (3,4).\n\nFood:\n\n- (3,5) with value 1, life span 5\n\n- (2,2) with value 1, life span 5\n\n- (6,4) with value 1, life span 6\n\n- (6,6) with value 1, life span 9\n\nAll food has value +1, so all positive food, no negative food mentioned. Value 1 for all, and life span decreasing each turn.\n\nLife span: for (3,5), life span 5, so it disappears after 5 turns, including current turn? The rule says: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) | Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo at turn t, if life span is L, it will disappear after L turns, meaning it can be eaten from turn t to t+L-1? Let's think.\n\nIf life span is N at turn t, it decreases each turn, so after N turns, it disappears. That means it exists for N turns starting from now.\n\nFor example, at turn 5, life span 5: it will be there for turns 5,6,7,8,9, and disappear at turn 10? Or at turn 5 it has 5 turns left, so it decreases to 4 at turn 6, to 3 at turn 7, ..., to 0 at turn 10, and disappears when it reaches 0? The rule says \"disappears after N turns\", so probably after N turns from now, it's gone.\n\nSimilarly, for (2,2) life span 5 at turn 5, same thing.\n\n(6,4) life span 6, so until turn 10? Turn 5: life 6, turn 6: life 5, ..., turn 10: life 1, turn 11: gone? Let's calculate.\n\nAt turn t, food with life span L:\n\n- It can be eaten on turns t, t+1, ..., t+L-1\n\n- It disappears at the start of turn t+L or something. But for planning, we care when it's available.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- Food at (3,5): life span 5 at turn 5, so available turns 5,6,7,8,9 (5 turns)\n\n- (2,2): life span 5, available turns 5 to 9\n\n- (6,4): life span 6, available turns 5 to 10\n\n- (6,6): life span 9, available turns 5 to 13\n\nNow, snake head at (3,4), direction Up. So from (3,3) to (3,4), so it moved up.\n\nPossible moves: Up, Down, Left, Right, but cannot reverse instantly. Since head direction is Up, reverse would be Down, so I cannot move Down next. Allowed moves: Up, Left, Right. Down is not allowed because it would be opposite to current direction.\n\nRule: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\"\n\nCurrent head direction is Up, so next move cannot be Down. So possible actions: U (up), L (left), R (right). D (down) is forbidden.\n\nNow, grid: let's sketch the grid mentally.\n\nx from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, so snake can only be on x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6.\n\nInternal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3)\n\n(2,4) is an obstacle, and snake body is at (3,3) and head (3,4). (3,4) is head, (3,3) is tail.\n\nFood at (3,5), (2,2), (6,4), (6,6)\n\n(3,5) is directly above head, since head at (3,4), up would be (3,5).\n\nBut (3,5) has food, and if I move up, I go to (3,5), which has food.\n\nBut I need to check if it's safe to eat.\n\nFirst, possible moves from (3,4):\n\n- Up: to (3,5)\n\n- Left: to (2,4)\n\n- Right: to (4,4)\n\nNow, (2,4) is an internal obstacle? Internal obstacles are given: [(5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3)]\n\n(2,4) is listed, so (2,4) is a wall, cannot move there.\n\nSimilarly, (4,4) is also an internal obstacle, wall.\n\nAnd (6,3) and (5,6), (1,4).\n\nSo from (3,4), moving left to (2,4) is impossible, it's a wall.\n\nMoving right to (4,4) is also impossible, wall.\n\nMoving up to (3,5): is that free? (3,5) has food, but no obstacle mentioned, so it should be free except for the food.\n\nBut food can be eaten when head moves there.\n\nAlso, walls include internal obstacles, so cells to avoid: walls and snake body.\n\nSnake body: positions [(3,4), (3,3)], so head is (3,4), body is (3,3), so when moving, if I move to (3,5), it's not body, but food.\n\nNow, moving left to (2,4) is wall, not possible.\n\nMoving right to (4,4) is wall, not possible.\n\nMoving down: but down is opposite to current direction (Up), so not allowed.\n\nSo only possible move is Up to (3,5).\n\nIs that right?\n\nCurrent head direction is U, meaning it just moved up to (3,4), so from (3,3) to (3,4), direction Up.\n\nNext move, I cannot move down because that would be reverse.\n\nBut moving left or right should be possible, but in this case, left to (2,4) is wall, right to (4,4) is wall, so indeed, only up is possible.\n\nBut let's confirm the positions.\n\nx increases right, y increases up, I assume, since U is (x,y+1).\n\nStandard: U: y+1, D: y-1, L: x-1, R: x+1.\n\nSo head at (3,4), U to (3,5), which is available.\n\n(2,4): internal obstacle, wall.\n\n(4,4): internal obstacle, wall.\n\n(3,3) is snake body, but I'm not moving to it; moving down to (3,3) would be reverse and to body, but not allowed anyway.\n\nSo only choice is to move Up to (3,5).\n\nAt (3,5) there is food with value +1, life span 5.\n\nIf I eat it, snake grows: since positive food, length increases by one, so snake will have positions: new head at (3,5), previous head (3,4) becomes body, and tail (3,3) remains until next move? When snake eats, it grows after moving.\n\nRule: when head moves to a food cell, it eats it, and the snake grows immediately, so the tail doesn't move that turn.\n\nStandard snake: when you eat food, you grow, so the tail stays in place, so the new segment is added where the head was, but since head moves to food, the previous head position becomes the new body segment, and tail doesn't move.\n\nIn terms of positions: before move, snake positions: [(3,4), (3,3)] head at (3,4), tail at (3,3)\n\nAfter moving up to (3,5) and eating food: head moves to (3,5), and since it ate, the tail doesn't move, so new positions: [(3,5), (3,4), (3,3)] so now three segments.\n\nIf no food, tail would move to the next position, but here since food, tail stays.\n\nIn this case, after move to (3,5) with food, snake becomes [(3,5), (3,4), (3,3)]\n\nNow, I need to think ahead 5+ turns.\n\nBut for turn 5, I must move, and only possible move is Up, so I have to do that.\n\nThen for future turns, I need to plan.\n\nBut the answer should be for multiple turns, starting from turn 5.\n\nAnswer format: Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, etc.\n\nt1=5, so Turn 5: action, Turn 6: action, and so on.\n\nBut since I have to choose actions for several turns, I need to simulate.\n\nFirst, for turn 5, only possible action is U (up) to (3,5), eating the food there.\n\nSo snake grows to length 3: positions [(3,5), (3,4), (3,3)]\n\nHead direction now is Up, since it moved up.\n\nNow, turn 6.\n\nHead at (3,5), direction Up.\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L, R, but no reverse: cannot move down, since current direction is Up.\n\nSo can move U, L, R.\n\nNow, what are the adjacent cells:\n\n- U: (3,6)\n\n- L: (2,5)\n\n- R: (4,5)\n\nNow, check for walls and body.\n\nWalls: borders x=0,7 y=0,7, so (3,6): y=6, which is not y=7, so y=6 is within 1-6? y from 1 to 6, since walls at y=0 and y=7, so y=1 to 6 are free, but y=6 is adjacent to wall, but not wall itself.\n\nx=1 to 6, y=1 to 6.\n\n(3,6): x=3, y=6, which is on the top row, but not wall, since wall is y=7.\n\nSimilarly, (2,5): x=2,y=5, should be free.\n\n(4,5): x=4,y=5, free.\n\nInternal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3)\n\n(2,4) is obstacle, but (2,5) is not listed, so should be free.\n\nSimilarly, (4,4) is obstacle, (4,5) not listed.\n\n(3,6) not listed.\n\nNow, snake body: positions [(3,5), (3,4), (3,3)], so (3,5) is head, (3,4) and (3,3) are body.\n\nIf I move up to (3,6), it's empty, no body or wall.\n\nIf I move left to (2,5), empty.\n\nRight to (4,5), empty.\n\nAlso, food: current food:\n\n(3,5) was eaten, so removed? When food is eaten, it disappears.\n\nAt turn 5, we ate (3,5), so it should be gone.\n\nRemaining food:\n\n(2,2), life span 5, but at turn 6, life span decreases to 4? Life span at turn 5 was 5 for (2,2), so at turn 6, it should be life span 4, still available.\n\nSimilarly, (6,4) life span 6 at turn 5, turn 6 life span 5.\n\n(6,6) life span 9 at turn 5, turn 6 life span 8.\n\nAnd (2,2) at (2,2), value 1.\n\nNow, for turn 6, I can move U, L, or R from (3,5).\n\nI need to think long-term.\n\nFood locations: (2,2) at bottom-left, (6,4) right-middle, (6,6) top-right.\n\nSnake at (3,5), which is top-middle.\n\nAlso, obstacles: (1,4), (2,4), (4,4) are walls, so around (3,4) it's blocked except up.\n\n(2,4) and (4,4) are walls, so from (3,5), moving left to (2,5) is possible, but (2,4) below is wall, but (2,5) is free.\n\nSimilarly, right to (4,5) free.\n\nUp to (3,6) free.\n\nBut (3,6) is y=6, which is the top row, one below wall y=7.\n\nNow, I should aim for other food.\n\n(2,2) is at (2,2), which is far, life span 5 at turn 5, so available until turn 9.\n\nSimilarly, (6,4) at (6,4), life span 6 at turn 5, available until turn 10.\n\n(6,6) at (6,6), life span 9, available longer.\n\nAlso, tail is at (3,3), which is below.\n\nNow, if I move up to (3,6), that's towards the top, but no food there directly.\n\n(6,6) is at top-right.\n\nIf I move left to (2,5), that's towards (2,2), but (2,5) to (2,2) is down, but there might be obstacles.\n\nSimilarly, right to (4,5) towards (6,4) or (6,6).\n\nBut (6,4) is at y=4, x=6.\n\nAlso, internal obstacles: (5,6) is wall, (6,3) is wall, etc.\n\nLet me list all blocked cells:\n\nWalls:\n\n- Borders: all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7\n\n- Internal: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3)\n\nSo free cells: x=1-6, y=1-6 except those internal obstacles.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- (1,4) wall\n\n- (2,4) wall\n\n- (4,4) wall\n\n- (5,6) wall\n\n- (6,3) wall\n\nAnd borders impassable.\n\nNow, from (3,5), moves:\n\n- U to (3,6): free, no food\n\n- L to (2,5): free, no food\n\n- R to (4,5): free, no food\n\nAll adjacent cells are free but no food.\n\nNow, I need to plan a path to other food.\n\nFirst, (2,2) at (2,2): to reach it, I need to go down and left.\n\nBut from (3,5), if I go left to (2,5), then from there, possible moves.\n\n(2,5) to where? From (2,5), head direction would be left, so cannot move right (reverse).\n\nPossible: U, D, L.\n\nBut U to (2,6), D to (2,4), but (2,4) is wall, so cannot move down to (2,4).\n\nL to (1,5), but x=1, y=5, x=1 is not wall? Borders: walls are x=0 and x=7, so x=1 is free, but adjacent to x=0 wall.\n\nx=1 to 6 are free, except internal obstacles.\n\n(1,5): not listed as obstacle, so should be free.\n\nSimilarly, (2,6) free.\n\nSo from (2,5), possible moves: U to (2,6), L to (1,5), D not possible (wall or not, (2,4) is wall, so cannot move down).\n\nSimilarly, if I go right from (3,5) to (4,5), then from (4,5), direction right, so cannot move left.\n\nPossible: U, D, R.\n\nD to (4,4) but (4,4) is wall, so cannot move down.\n\nU to (4,6), R to (5,5).\n\n(4,6) and (5,5) should be free, except (5,6) is wall, but (4,6) is different.\n\n(4,6) x=4,y=6, not obstacle.\n\n(5,5) x=5,y=5, not obstacle.\n\nBut (5,6) is wall, so (5,5) is free.\n\nNow, back to turn 6.\n\nI have to choose U, L, or R.\n\nBut I need to think about the tail and potential dangers.\n\nSnake is now [(3,5), (3,4), (3,3)], all in a vertical line.\n\nTail is at (3,3).\n\nIf I move, for example, to (3,6), then snake moves, no food, so tail moves to (3,4)? When no food eaten, tail moves.\n\nAfter moving to (3,6), no food there, so head at (3,6), body: previous head (3,5) becomes body, and tail (3,3) is removed? Positions: before move, [(3,5), (3,4), (3,3)]\n\nAfter moving U to (3,6), no food, so snake becomes [(3,6), (3,5), (3,4)] and tail (3,3) is left, so positions: head (3,6), body (3,5), (3,4), tail (3,4)? Let's see: the segment that was tail (3,3) is removed, and head moves to new position, so body segments stay, tail is gone.\n\nSo new positions: [(3,6), (3,5), (3,4)] with head at (3,6), tail at (3,4).\n\nSimilarly, if I move left to (2,5), then head to (2,5), no food, so positions: [(2,5), (3,5), (3,4)] tail at (3,4).\n\n(3,5) was head, now body, (3,4) body, tail (3,3) removed.\n\nOriginal: positions list head to tail: [(3,5), (3,4), (3,3)]\n\nAfter move to (2,5) no food: head moves to (2,5), the body segments remain, but the tail is removed, so body becomes (3,5) and (3,4), but (3,4) was second, now it should be the new tail? Positions: the first segment is new head, then the previous head becomes the neck, and so on, tail is removed if no growth.\n\nSo new positions: [new head, previous head, previous body...] but since no growth, the list has one less segment? No.\n\nSnake has segments: when no food, head moves to new cell, and tail is removed from the list.\n\nSo positions: before move, N segments.\n\nAfter move to empty cell, head moves to new position, and the tail position is removed, so N-1 segments? No, the snake length doesn't change, only when eating.\n\nLength remains the same when not eating.\n\nFor example, from [(3,5), (3,4), (3,3)] move to (2,5) no food: head moves to (2,5), so the body is now from (3,5) to (3,4), and tail was (3,3) is removed, so new positions: head (2,5), then the previous head (3,5) becomes the first body segment, and (3,4) becomes the tail, so [(2,5), (3,5), (3,4)]\n\nSimilarly, if I had moved up to (3,6) no food: [(3,6), (3,5), (3,4)]\n\nTail at (3,4).\n\nIn both cases, tail is at (3,4) after move.\n\nOriginal tail was (3,3), after move, it's removed.\n\nNow for turn 6, I need to choose.\n\nBut I also have to consider the food life spans.\n\n(2,2) available until turn 9, (6,4) until turn 10, (6,6) until turn 13.\n\nTurn 6 is early, so I have time.\n\nBut the snake is at (3,5), and (2,2) is at (2,2), which is 3 steps away in Manhattan distance, but with obstacles.\n\nFrom (3,5) to (2,2): possible path, but need to go left and down.\n\nBut from (3,5), if I go left to (2,5), then from (2,5), I can go down? But (2,4) is wall, so I cannot go down from (2,5) because (2,4) is wall.\n\nFrom (2,5), I can go left to (1,5) or up to (2,6), or down not possible.\n\nTo go down, I need to go to (2,3) or something, but (2,4) is blocked, so I cannot go directly down from (2,5).\n\nFrom (2,5), I can go to (1,5), then from (1,5) to (1,4)? (1,4) is internal obstacle, wall, so cannot go down to (1,4).\n\nFrom (1,5), I can go down? U, D, L, R.\n\nFrom (1,5), direction left (if I came from right), so cannot move right.\n\nPossible: U to (1,6), D to (1,4), but (1,4) wall, L to (0,5) but x=0 wall, so only U to (1,6) or other? D not possible, L not possible, so only U to (1,6) or if I can move right, but cannot reverse, so if I moved left to (1,5), direction left, so can move U, D, or L, but D and L not possible, so only U to (1,6).\n\nThen from (1,6), similar issue.\n\nThis seems stuck.\n\nFrom (2,5), I can go to (2,6), then from (2,6) to where? To go to (2,2), I need to go down, but (2,4) wall, so I have to go around.\n\nFor example, from (2,6) to (3,6) or (1,6), etc.\n\nBut (2,2) is at y=2, and (2,4) blocked, so to reach (2,2), I need to go to (2,3) or (1,2), etc., but (2,3) is free? Let's see what cells are free around.\n\ny=2: cells (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2) should be free, except no obstacles listed, so all free.\n\nBut to access (2,2), from above, (2,3) is above (2,2), and (2,3) should be free, since no obstacle.\n\n(2,4) is wall, but (2,3) is not wall.\n\nSimilarly, (1,3), etc.\n\nFrom (2,5), I can go to (2,6) or (1,5), but not down.\n\nFrom (2,6), I can go down to (2,5)? No, if I move to (2,6), direction up, then from there I can move D, L, R.\n\nD to (2,5), which is back, but possible, or L to (1,6), R to (3,6), etc.\n\nBut to reach lower y, I need to go to x=3 or something.\n\nFor example, from (2,5) I can go to (3,5) but that's back, or to (2,6), then to (3,6), then to (3,5) or (3,4), but (3,4) is body or what.\n\nAt turn 6, if I go left to (2,5), then positions: [(2,5), (3,5), (3,4)] tail at (3,4).\n\nThen from (2,5), I can move to (2,6) or (1,5).\n\nIf I move to (2,6), then positions: [(2,6), (2,5), (3,5)] tail at (3,5).\n\nThen from (2,6), I can move down to (2,5), but (2,5) is now body, so collision, cannot.\n\nOr left to (1,6), or right to (3,6).\n\nSay move to (3,6), then positions: [(3,6), (2,6), (2,5)] etc.\n\nBut to reach (2,2), I need to get to y=2.\n\nFrom (3,6), I can move down to (3,5), but (3,5) might be body or not.\n\nThis is getting messy. Perhaps it's easier to go right instead.\n\nLet's look at (6,4) and (6,6).\n\n(6,4) is at (6,4), which is near the right wall.\n\n(6,6) at top-right.\n\nFrom (3,5), if I go right to (4,5), then from (4,5), I can go to (4,6) or (5,5) or (4,4) but (4,4) wall, so cannot down.\n\nSo U to (4,6), R to (5,5), or D not possible.\n\n(4,6) is free, (5,5) free.\n\nThen from there, to (6,4) or (6,6).\n\n(6,4) is at (6,4), which has an obstacle at (6,3), but (6,4) itself is not obstacle, so it can be accessed.\n\nFor example, from (5,4) or (6,5), etc.\n\n(6,5) should be free.\n\nSimilarly, (6,6) from (6,5) or (5,6), but (5,6) is obstacle, so only from (6,5) or (7,6) but x=7 wall, so from (6,5).\n\nNow, back to turn 6 decision.\n\nI also have to consider the tail reward danger.\n\nRule: \"Tail Reward Danger: If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n\nBut in this case, at turn 6, tail is at (3,4), and head at (3,5), so they are adjacent vertically.\n\nBut the tail cell is (3,4), which has no food; food was at (3,5) but eaten, so (3,4) is empty.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nFor now, no immediate danger.\n\nBut I need to plan for multiple turns.\n\nSince (2,2) is harder to reach due to obstacles, and life span only until turn 9, it might not be worth it, or I can go for it later.\n\nSimilarly, (6,4) and (6,6) are easier to reach.\n\n(6,6) has longer life span.\n\nAt turn 6, from (3,5), I can move up to (3,6) to go towards (6,6), or right to (4,5) to go towards (6,4) or (6,6).\n\nMoving left to (2,5) might lead to dead end for reaching (2,2), but let's see if (2,2) can be reached.\n\nFrom (2,5), I can go to (1,5), then to (1,6), then to (1,7) but y=7 wall, so only to (1,6), then from (1,6) I can go to (1,5) or (2,6) or (0,6) wall, so only (2,6) or (1,5), but (1,5) is previous.\n\nTo go down, I need to go to (2,3) or (3,2), etc.\n\nFrom (1,6), I can go to (2,6), then to (3,6), then to (3,5), but (3,5) might be occupied.\n\nAt turn 6, if I go left to (2,5), then positions: [(2,5), (3,5), (3,4)]\n\nThen from (2,5), I can move to (1,5) (left), or (2,6) (up), or down not possible.\n\nSay I move to (1,5), then positions: [(1,5), (2,5), (3,5)] tail at (3,5)\n\nThen from (1,5), direction left, so can move U, D, L.\n\nU to (1,6), D to (1,4) wall, L to (0,5) wall, so only U to (1,6)\n\nThen positions: [(1,6), (1,5), (2,5)] tail at (2,5)\n\nThen from (1,6), can move U to (1,7) wall, D to (1,5) body, L to (0,6) wall, R to (2,6)\n\nSo only R to (2,6)\n\nPositions: [(2,6), (1,6), (1,5)] tail at (1,5)\n\nThen from (2,6), can move U to (2,7) wall, D to (2,5) body (since (1,5) is tail but not adjacent), positions: head (2,6), body (1,6), tail (1,5), so (2,5) is free? (2,5) is not occupied now.\n\nAt this point, snake is at (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), so cells occupied: (2,6), (1,6), (1,5)\n\n(2,5) is free.\n\nSo from (2,6), possible moves: D to (2,5), R to (3,6), L to (1,6) body, U wall, so can move D or R.\n\nIf move D to (2,5), then positions: [(2,5), (2,6), (1,6)] tail at (1,6)\n\nThen from (2,5), I can move D to (2,4) wall, not possible; L to (1,5) body; R to (3,5) free; U to (2,6) body.\n\nSo only R to (3,5)\n\nBut (3,5) might be free, but I'm back to (3,5), which is where I was, but now snake is different.\n\nThis is inefficient and I'm not getting closer to (2,2).\n\nFrom (2,6), if I move R to (3,6), then positions: [(3,6), (2,6), (1,6)] tail at (1,6)\n\nThen from (3,6), I can move to (3,5), (3,7) wall, (4,6), (2,6) body.\n\n(4,6) is free? (4,6) not obstacle, but (5,6) is wall, but (4,6) free.\n\n(3,5) free.\n\nSo I can move to (3,5) or (4,6).\n\nBut (3,5) is down, so I can start going down.\n\nBut to reach (2,2), I need to go to (2,3) or (3,2).\n\n(2,3) is at x=2,y=3, which is free, and (2,4) is wall, but (2,3) is below.\n\nFrom (3,6), if I move to (3,5), then positions: [(3,5), (3,6), (2,6)] tail at (2,6)\n\nThen from (3,5), I can move to (3,4), but (3,4) is now free? Previous tail at (1,6), so (3,4) free.\n\n(3,4) is free, no obstacle.\n\nMove to (3,4), then to (3,3), etc., but (2,2) is at (2,2), so from (3,4) I can move left to (2,4) but (2,4) wall, not possible.\n\nFrom (3,4), I can move down to (3,3), then to (3,2), then to (2,2) or (4,2), etc.\n\nFrom (3,2), I can move left to (2,2) if possible.\n\n(2,2) is food, so I can go there.\n\nBut from (3,5), after some moves, I can go down to (3,4), then to (3,3), then to (3,2), then to (2,2) by moving left, but from (3,2) to (2,2), is it possible? (2,2) is adjacent left, and no wall, so yes.\n\nBut to get from (3,5) to (3,2), I need to move down three times, but with obstacles.\n\n(3,4) is free now, since snake moved away.\n\nIn the path above, when I was at (3,5) with snake [(3,5), (3,6), (2,6)], I can move down to (3,4), assuming (3,4) free.\n\nThen to (3,3), then to (3,2), then to (2,2).\n\nEach move down, and at (3,2) move left to (2,2).\n\nBut from (3,2) to (2,2) is left, so direction changes.\n\nBut it's possible, but it takes several turns, and (2,2) life span 5 at turn 5, so at turn 6, life 4, turn 7 life 3, etc., so available until turn 9.\n\nTurn 6: if I start from (3,5) at turn 6, move to (3,4) at turn 7, to (3,3) at turn 8, to (3,2) at turn 9, to (2,2) at turn 10.\n\nBut (2,2) disappears after turn 9, so at turn 10 it's gone. Life span 5 at turn 5, available turns 5,6,7,8,9. Disappears at turn 10.\n\nSo to eat at turn 10 is too late; must eat by turn 9.\n\nAt turn 9, I need to be at (2,2).\n\nIf at turn 6 I am at (3,5), I can move to (3,4) at turn 7, to (3,3) at turn 8, then at turn 9 I can move to (2,2) directly from (3,2)? At turn 8, if I am at (3,3), I can move to (3,2) or (2,3) or (4,3), etc.\n\nFrom (3,3) to (2,2) is not adjacent; it's diagonal, not possible. Moves are only orthogonal.\n\nFrom (3,3), I can move to (3,2), (3,4), (2,3), (4,3).\n\n(2,2) is not adjacent to (3,3); it's at (2,2), so from (3,3) to (2,2) is not possible directly.\n\nI need to be at (2,3) or (3,2) or (2,1) etc. to reach (2,2).\n\nFrom (3,3), I can move to (2,3) or (3,2).\n\nIf to (2,3), then from (2,3) to (2,2) down.\n\nSimilarly, if to (3,2), then to (2,2) left.\n\nBut from (3,3), at turn 8, move to (2,3) or (3,2), then at turn 9 move to (2,2).\n\nSo if I can be at (3,3) by turn 8, then at turn 9 I can eat (2,2).\n\nNow, at turn 6, I am at (3,5).\n\nIf I move down to (3,4) at turn 6, then to (3,3) at turn 7, then to (3,2) or (2,3) at turn 8, then to (2,2) at turn 9.\n\nLet's see the sequence.\n\nTurn 6: from (3,5) move D to (3,4)\n\nBut current head direction at turn 6 is Up, since I moved up to (3,5) at turn 5.\n\nAt turn 5, I moved U to (3,5), so head direction is U.\n\nAt turn 6, I want to move D to (3,4), but D is opposite to U, so instant reverse, not allowed.\n\nI cannot move down because it's reverse.\n\nFrom (3,5) direction U, I can only move U, L, or R, not D.\n\nSo I cannot move down directly.\n\nTo go down, I need to change direction.\n\nFor example, move left or right first.\n\nSay at turn 6, from (3,5) move L to (2,5)\n\nThen at turn 7, from (2,5) I can move D? But (2,4) wall, not possible, so move to (2,6) or (1,5), say (2,6)\n\nThen at turn 8, from (2,6) move to (2,5) or (3,6), say (3,6)\n\nThen at turn 9, from (3,6) move to (3,5), etc., not getting down.\n\nFrom (2,6) move D to (2,5) at turn 8, but (2,5) may be body.\n\nEarlier sequence with move to (2,5) at turn 6.\n\nTurn 6: move L to (2,5), positions: [(2,5), (3,5), (3,4)]\n\nHead direction now Left.\n\nTurn 7: from (2,5), cannot move right (reverse), cannot move down (wall), so move U to (2,6) or L to (1,5)\n\nSay move U to (2,6), positions: [(2,6), (2,5), (3,5)] direction Up.\n\nTurn 8: from (2,6), can move D to (2,5) but (2,5) is body, collision; L to (1,6), R to (3,6)\n\nSay move R to (3,6), positions: [(3,6), (2,6), (2,5)] direction Right.\n\nTurn 9: from (3,6), can move U to (3,7) wall, D to (3,5), L to (2,6) body, R to (4,6)\n\n(4,6) free, or D to (3,5)\n\n(3,5) is free now? Positions have (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), so (3,5) free.\n\nMove D to (3,5), positions: [(3,5), (3,6), (2,6)] tail at (2,6)\n\nThen at turn 10, from (3,5) move to (3,4), etc.\n\nBut I'm not at (2,2) by turn 9; I'm at (3,5) at turn 9, and (2,2) is gone.\n\nSo it's impossible to reach (2,2) by turn 9 from here with the obstacles, because the path is blocked and it takes too many turns.\n\nTherefore, I should not pursue (2,2); it's not reachable in time.\n\nFocus on (6,4) and (6,6).\n\n(6,4) at (6,4), life span 6 at turn 5, so available turns 5 to 10.\n\n(6,6) available turns 5 to 13.\n\nAt turn 6, snake at (3,5).\n\nI can move right to (4,5) to start heading east.\n\nOr up to (3,6) north, or left but left is not useful.\n\nSo let's go right to (4,5).\n\nTurn 6: move R to (4,5)\n\nPositions: [(4,5), (3,5), (3,4)] head direction Right.\n\nNow, (4,5) is free, no food.\n\nTurn 7: from (4,5), direction R, so cannot move left (reverse).\n\nPossible moves: U to (4,6), D to (4,4), but (4,4) is wall, so cannot move down.\n\nR to (5,5), U to (4,6)\n\nSo U or R.\n\n(5,5) free, (4,6) free.\n\nI can go to (5,5) to be closer to (6,4).\n\n(6,4) is at (6,4), so from (5,5) I can go down to (5,4) then to (6,4), or directly if possible.\n\n(5,4) should be free.\n\nSimilarly, (6,5) free.\n\nBut obstacle at (6,3), but (6,4) is food.\n\nAlso, (6,6) is at (6,6).\n\nNow, at turn 7, from (4,5), move R to (5,5)\n\nPositions: [(5,5), (4,5), (3,5)] tail at (3,5)\n\nDirection Right.\n\nTurn 8: from (5,5), direction R, so cannot move left.\n\nPossible: U to (5,6), but (5,6) is internal obstacle, wall, so cannot move up.\n\nD to (5,4), R to (6,5)\n\n(5,4) free, (6,5) free.\n\nSo can move D to (5,4) or R to (6,5)\n\n(6,4) is at (6,4), so moving to (5,4) then to (6,4) or to (6,5) then down to (6,4).\n\nMove to (5,4) first.\n\nTurn 8: move D to (5,4)\n\nPositions: [(5,4), (5,5), (4,5)] direction Down.\n\nNow, (5,4) has no food.\n\nTurn 9: from (5,4), direction D, so cannot move up.\n\nPossible moves: D to (5,3), L to (4,4) but (4,4) wall, R to (6,4), U not possible.\n\nD to (5,3), R to (6,4)\n\n(5,3) should be free, (6,4) has food.\n\n(6,4) is food, so I can move directly to (6,4) if possible.\n\n(6,4) is adjacent right, so move R to (6,4)\n\nThen eat the food.\n\nLife span: at turn 5, life span 6, so available at turn 9? Turns available: 5,6,7,8,9,10. Turn 9 is within.\n\nAt turn 9, move to (6,4), eat food, grow.\n\nPositions: before move, snake [(5,4), (5,5), (4,5)]\n\nAfter move R to (6,4), with food, so head to (6,4), body: previous head (5,4) becomes body, tail does not move, so new positions: [(6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5)] length 4.\n\nHead direction now Right.\n\nNow, what about the tail? Tail is at (4,5), head at (6,4), not adjacent.\n\nNow, after eating, I have to continue.\n\nBut for the sequence, I need to output actions for several turns.\n\nAlso, there is (6,6) food with longer life.\n\nBut let's complete the path to (6,4).\n\nIn the sequence above, at turn 9 I can eat (6,4).\n\nNow, from turn 6 to turn 9.\n\nTurn 6: move R to (4,5)\n\nTurn 7: move R to (5,5)\n\nTurn 8: move D to (5,4)  // since I moved down, but at turn 8 from (5,5) to (5,4)\n\nIn turn 8, from (5,5), I could move directly to (6,5) instead of (5,4).\n\nBut (6,5) has no food, then to (6,4) later.\n\nBut moving to (5,4) is fine.\n\nThen turn 9: move R to (6,4) eat.\n\nBut at turn 9, from (5,4), direction down, move right to (6,4), which is not reverse, so ok.\n\nNow, what about turn 5? I have to start from turn 5.\n\nTurn 5: only possible move U to (3,5)\n\nThen turn 6: move R to (4,5)\n\nTurn 7: move R to (5,5)\n\nTurn 8: move D to (5,4)\n\nBut at turn 8, from (5,5), I can move to (6,5) instead.\n\nIf I move to (6,5) at turn 8.\n\nTurn 8: from (5,5) move R to (6,5)\n\nPositions: [(6,5), (5,5), (4,5)] direction Right.\n\nThen turn 9: from (6,5), direction R, so cannot move left.\n\nPossible moves: U to (6,6), D to (6,4), L not possible, R to (7,5) wall.\n\n(6,6) has food, (6,4) has food.\n\nBoth are adjacent.\n\nI can move to (6,4) or to (6,6).\n\n(6,4) life span available until turn 10, (6,6) until turn 13.\n\nAt turn 9, I can eat either.\n\nIf I eat (6,4), positions: move to (6,4), eat, grow: head (6,4), body (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), tail at (4,5)\n\nThen head at (6,4), tail at (4,5), not adjacent.\n\nIf I eat (6,6), move U to (6,6), eat, grow: head (6,6), body (6,5), (5,5), (4,5)\n\nNow, I need to think about the future.\n\nAfter eating, I have to avoid walls and body.\n\nAlso, there might be tail reward danger later.\n\nBut for now, since I have to output actions, and for turn 5 to, say, turn 9.\n\nBut the answer should be for multiple turns, but I don't know how many; the user didn't specify, but I think I should provide a sequence for the next few turns.\n\nPerhaps 5 turns ahead, but from turn 5 to turn 10 or something.\n\nSince at turn 5 I have to move U, then I can plan the subsequent moves.\n\nIn the sequence above, to reach (6,4) by turn 9.\n\nI could go for (6,6) instead.\n\n(6,6) at (6,6), which is corner.\n\nAt turn 6, from (3,5), instead of right, I could move up to (3,6) first.\n\nThen to (4,6), etc.\n\nBut (4,6) free, then to (5,6) but (5,6) wall, not possible.\n\nFrom (3,6) to (4,6), then from (4,6) to (4,5) or (5,6) wall, or (3,6) back, or (4,7) wall.\n\nSo from (4,6), can move to (4,5) or to (5,6) not, so down to (4,5) or left to (3,6), etc.\n\nThen to (5,5), etc., similar path.\n\nBut to (6,6), from (6,5) or something.\n\nIn the first path, by going right then down, I can reach (6,4) or (6,5) easily.\n\nNow, back to the tail danger: at some point, if head is adjacent to tail and tail has food, but in this case, no food on tail cells yet.\n\nFood can spawn under body, but here no such thing mentioned.\n\nFor turn 5, I must move U.\n\nThen for turn 6, I need to choose.\n\nIf I move R to (4,5), as above.\n\nI could move U to (3,6), but then I might not reach food in time for (6,4), but (6,4) available until turn 10.\n\nAt turn 6: if move U to (3,6), positions: [(3,6), (3,5), (3,4)] direction Up.\n\nTurn 7: from (3,6), direction U, cannot move D.\n\nPossible: U to (3,7) wall, L to (2,6), R to (4,6)\n\nSo move L or R.\n\nSay move R to (4,6), positions: [(4,6), (3,6), (3,5)] direction Right.\n\nTurn 8: from (4,6), direction R, cannot move L.\n\nPossible: U to (4,7) wall, D to (4,5), R to (5,6) wall.\n\nSo only D to (4,5)\n\nPositions: [(4,5), (4,6), (3,6)] direction Down.\n\nTurn 9: from (4,5), direction D, cannot move U.\n\nPossible: D to (4,4) wall, L to (3,5), R to (5,5)\n\n(3,5) may be free, (5,5) free.\n\nMove R to (5,5), positions: [(5,5), (4,5), (4,6)]\n\nThen turn 10: from (5,5) to (5,4) or (6,5), then to (6,4) at turn 10 or 11.\n\n(6,4) available until turn 10, so at turn 10 I can eat if I move to it.\n\nBut at turn 10, if I am at (5,5), I can move to (5,4) or (6,5).\n\nIf to (6,5), then to (6,4) at turn 11, too late.\n\nIf to (5,4) at turn 10, then to (6,4) at turn 11, still late.\n\nFrom (5,5) at turn 10, I can move directly to (6,4) if adjacent, but (6,4) is at (6,4), (5,5) to (6,4) is diagonal, not adjacent; only orthogonal moves.\n\nSo I need to be at (6,5) or (5,4) first.\n\n(5,4) to (6,4) is right, adjacent.\n\nBut at turn 10, if I move to (5,4) or (6,5), then at turn 11 to (6,4), but (6,4) disappears at turn 11? Life span 6 at turn 5, available turns 5 to 10, so turn 11 gone. Cannot eat at turn 11.\n\nTherefore, to eat (6,4), I must be on an adjacent cell at turn 10 or earlier.\n\nIn this path, at turn 10 I am at (5,5), which is not adjacent to (6,4), so I cannot eat it in time if I go via (3,6).\n\nWhereas in the first path, I can eat at turn 9.\n\nTherefore, better to go directly right from turn 6.\n\nMoreover, (6,6) is still available later.\n\nSo for turn 6, move R to (4,5).\n\nThen as before.\n\nNow for the sequence.\n\nAlso, at turn 5, I have to move U.\n\nNow, after eating (6,4) at turn 9, I can go for (6,6) or other.\n\nBut let's output the actions.\n\nFirst, turn 5: U\n\nThen turn 6: R (to (4,5))\n\nThen turn 7: from (4,5) move to (5,5), so R\n\nThen turn 8: from (5,5) move to (5,4), so D\n\nThen turn 9: from (5,4) move to (6,4), so R\n\nBut at turn 9, after moving to (6,4), I eat and grow.\n\nNow, I need to think about turn 10 and beyond.\n\nBut perhaps for the answer, I can provide up to turn 9 or 10.\n\nSince the instruction says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", and from turn 5, 5 turns ahead to turn 10.\n\nBut at turn 10, I need to be careful.\n\nAfter turn 9: snake at [(6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5)] head direction Right (since moved right to (6,4))\n\nNow, possible moves: from (6,4), direction R, cannot move left (reverse).\n\nPossible: U to (6,5), D to (6,3), but (6,3) is internal obstacle, wall, so cannot move down.\n\nR to (7,4) wall, so only U to (6,5)\n\n(6,5) should be free, no food mentioned.\n\nMove U to (6,5)\n\nThen positions: [(6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5)] no food, so tail moves? When no eat, tail moves.\n\nBefore move, positions: head (6,4), body (5,4), (5,5), tail (4,5)\n\nAfter move to (6,5) no food, head moves to (6,5), tail (4,5) removed, so body: (6,4) becomes neck, (5,4), (5,5) becomes tail? Positions: [ (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5) ]? Order: head first, then previous head, then body.\n\nAfter eating at turn 9: positions [(6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5)]\n\nAfter turn 10 move to (6,5) no food: head to (6,5), so new head (6,5), then the segments: (6,4), (5,4), (5,5), and tail (4,5) is removed, so positions: [(6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5)] with tail at (5,5)\n\n(5,5) is tail.\n\nNow head at (6,5), direction Up (since moved up from (6,4)).\n\nPossible moves: U to (6,6), which has food.\n\nD to (6,4) but (6,4) is body, collision.\n\nL to (5,5) body, collision.\n\nR to (7,5) wall.\n\nSo only possible move is U to (6,6)\n\n(6,6) has food with value 1, life span 9 at turn 5, so at turn 10, life span 9 - (10-5) = 4? At turn 5 life 9, turn 6:8, ..., turn 10:4, still available.\n\nMove to (6,6), eat food.\n\nThen snake grows: head to (6,6), body: previous head (6,5) becomes body, tail does not move, so positions: [(6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5)] length 5.\n\nHead direction Up.\n\nNow, from here, I need to find a way out, but it might be tight.\n\nPossible moves: from (6,6), direction U, cannot move D.\n\nPossible: U to (6,7) wall, L to (5,6) but (5,6) is wall, internal obstacle, R to (7,6) wall, so no possible moves! Stuck.\n\n(6,6) is top-right corner.\n\nU: (6,7) wall\n\nL: (5,6) wall\n\nR: (7,6) wall\n\nD: (6,5) but body, collision.\n\nNo possible moves, snake dies.\n\nProblem.\n\nAfter eating at (6,6), I am trapped.\n\nTherefore, I should not eat (6,6) immediately; instead, at turn 10, from (6,5), I should not move up to (6,6), but I have no choice, as other moves are blocked.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 10, from (6,5), only move U to (6,6), which leads to death.\n\nTherefore, the path to (6,4) is dangerous because it forces me to (6,5) then to (6,6) with no escape.\n\nI need a different plan.\n\nPerhaps at turn 8, instead of moving to (5,4), move to (6,5).\n\nLet's go back.\n\nAt turn 5: U to (3,5)\n\nTurn 6: R to (4,5)\n\nTurn 7: R to (5,5)\n\nNow turn 8: from (5,5), instead of D to (5,4), move R to (6,5)\n\nPositions: [(6,5), (5,5), (4,5)] direction Right.\n\nNow, at turn 8, I am at (6,5), no food.\n\n(6,4) is below, (6,6) above.\n\nTurn 9: from (6,5), direction R, cannot move L.\n\nPossible: U to (6,6), D to (6,4), R to (7,5) wall.\n\nSo I can move to (6,6) or (6,4).\n\nIf I move to (6,4), eat food, grow: positions [(6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5)]\n\nHead direction Down (since moved down).\n\nThen turn 10: from (6,4), direction D, cannot move U.\n\nPossible: D to (6,3) but (6,3) wall, L to (5,4), R to (7,4) wall.\n\nSo only L to (5,4)\n\n(5,4) should be free, no food.\n\nMove to (5,4), positions: [(5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5)] tail at (5,5)\n\nThen I can continue, for example to (5,3) or (4,4) but (4,4) wall, so to (5,3) down, or left to (4,4) not, etc.\n\nBut not trapped.\n\nIf at turn 9 I move to (6,6) instead, eat, grow: positions [(6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5)] head direction Up.\n\nThen turn 10: from (6,6), only possible move D to (6,5) but body, collision, or other walls, so stuck and die.\n\nTherefore, at turn 9 from (6,5), I should move D to (6,4) to eat and not go to (6,6).\n\nThen as above, I can move left to (5,4) at turn 10.\n\nNow, to include in the sequence.\n\nFor the answer, I need to provide actions from turn 5 onwards.\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: R\n\nTurn 7: R (to (5,5))\n\nTurn 8: R (to (6,5))\n\nTurn 9: D (to (6,4) eat)\n\nThen turn 10: L (to (5,4))\n\nBut at turn 10, from (6,4) move L to (5,4), as above.\n\nNow, head direction after turn 9 move to (6,4) is Down, so at turn 10 move L to (5,4), which is left, not reverse, so ok.\n\nThen positions: [(5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5)] head direction Left.\n\nThen I can move from there.\n\nBut for the answer, since the user didn't specify how many turns, and to think 5+ ahead, I can provide up to turn 10 or so.\n\nPerhaps start with turn 5 to turn 9 or 10.\n\nAnother thing: at turn 5, I have to move U, but for future turns, I need to specify.\n\nIn the sequence above, I have actions.\n\nBut at turn 8, moving to (6,5) is fine.\n\nNow, to write the answer.\n\nBut let's confirm all.\n\nAlso, the tail danger: when I eat at (6,4) at turn 9, tail is at (4,5), head at (6,4), not adjacent, so no issue.\n\nSimilarly, no food on tail.\n\nSo sequence:\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: R\n\nTurn 7: R\n\nTurn 8: R (to (6,5))\n\nTurn 9: D (to (6,4) eat)\n\nFor turn 10, if I include, L to (5,4)\n\nBut since the answer format might expect a few turns, I think 5 turns: from turn 5 to turn 9.\n\nTurn 5,6,7,8,9: that's 5 actions.\n\nYes.\n\nAt turn 9 I eat, so score increases.\n\nAnd I avoided the trap.\n\nI could go for (6,6) later, but it might be risky.\n\nFor example, from (5,4) at turn 10, I can go to (5,3) or other cells.\n\nBut I don't need to specify further.\n\nSo the actions should be:\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: R\n\nTurn 7: R\n\nTurn 8: R\n\nTurn 9: D\n\nBut at turn 8, moving to (6,5), and turn 9 to (6,4).\n\nYes.\n\nIn the initial, I have only these moves.\n\nTo be thorough, at turn 5, only U possible.\n\nAt turn 6, from (3,5), I could move U or L, but L leads to dead end, U delays, so R is best to reach food quickly.\n\nSo I think this is fine.\n</think>\n### Analysis and Plan for Snake Game\n\n**Current State (Turn 5):**\n- **Snake Position**: Head at (3,4), body at (3,3). Snake length is 2.\n- **Head Direction**: Up (U).\n- **Walls**: Border walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Internal obstacles at (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3).\n- **Food**:\n  - (3,5): Value +1, life span 5 (available turns 5–9).\n  - (2,2): Value +1, life span 5 (available turns 5–9).\n  - (6,4): Value +1, life span 6 (available turns 5–10).\n  - (6,6): Value +1, life span 9 (available turns 5–13).\n- **Constraints**: \n  - From head position (3,4), only move Up (U) to (3,5) is possible due to walls at (2,4) and (4,4), and reverse move (Down) not allowed.\n  - After moving to (3,5) on turn 5, the snake eats the food and grows to length 3: positions [(3,5), (3,4), (3,3)].\n\n**Long-Term Strategy (5+ Turns Ahead):**\n- **Prioritize Survival and Food Access**: \n  - (2,2) is difficult to reach by turn 9 due to obstacles (e.g., (2,4) wall blocks direct path) and requires at least 4 turns from (3,5), making it risky to pursue. It is abandoned to avoid timeouts and dead ends.\n  - (6,4) is prioritized as it is reachable by turn 9 with a safe path, providing +1 score and extending the snake. Life span allows until turn 10.\n  - (6,6) has a longer life span but risks trapping the snake in the top-right corner after eating. It is deferred; if accessible later, it can be eaten.\n- **Path to (6,4):** \n  - Turn 6: From (3,5), move Right (R) to (4,5) to start heading east toward (6,4).\n  - Turn 7: From (4,5), move Right (R) to (5,5), continuing toward (6,4).\n  - Turn 8: From (5,5), move Right (R) to (6,5), positioning adjacent to (6,4).\n  - Turn 9: From (6,5), move Down (D) to (6,4), eating the food. Snake grows to length 4.\n- **Avoid Traps**: \n  - Moving directly to (6,6) on turn 9 or 10 risks immediate death due to walls and body collisions. Instead, after eating (6,4), future moves (e.g., Left to (5,4) on turn 10) open the board for survival and potential to reach (6,6) later if safe.\n- **Risk Assessment**: \n  - Tail Reward Danger: At no point is the head adjacent to the tail with food on the tail cell, so this risk is avoided.\n  - Collision Risks: Path avoids walls, obstacles, and body segments. After turn 9, the snake can safely navigate away from the corner.\n- **Turn-by-Turn Actions for Turns 5–9**: \n  - Turns 5–9 cover 5 moves, aligning with the 5+ turns ahead requirement. This sequence maximizes score by eating (3,5) and (6,4) while ensuring long-term survival.\n\n**Action Sequence:**\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 5: U \\\\\nTurn 6: R \\\\\nTurn 7: R \\\\\nTurn 8: R \\\\\nTurn 9: D\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 6. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the grid is from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are at those edges, meaning I can't go to those cells. Also, internal obstacles at (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3). So I must avoid those.\n\nSnake positions: head at (3,5), then body at (3,4), and tail at (3,3). Head direction is U, which is up, so currently moving upwards.\n\nFood:\n\n- (2,2) with life span 4, value +1 (positive food)\n\n- (6,4) with life span 5, value +1\n\n- (6,6) with life span 8, value +1\n\nAll food is positive, no negative food here.\n\nI need to plan actions for the next few turns, thinking at least 5 turns ahead. Prioritize long-term survival over immediate rewards.\n\nSince the head is at (3,5) moving up, possible moves are U, L, R. Can't move down because that's opposite direction (D), and no instant reverse. Current direction is U, so I can't go D next. So choices: U (up), L (left), R (right).\n\nIf I go U, to (3,6). Is that valid? y=6 is not y=7, so not wall. Walls are at y=0 and y=7, so y=6 is fine. Check obstacles: internal obstacles are (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3). (3,6) is not in that list, so should be safe.\n\nBut (3,6): is it occupied? Snake is at (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), so (3,6) is empty now. But food might be there? Food is at (2,2), (6,4), (6,6), not at (3,6). So moving U to (3,6) should be fine, no collision.\n\nSimilarly, L: left to (2,5). Is (2,5) valid? x=2, y=5. Walls: x=0 and x=7 are borders, so x=2 is fine. Obstacles: (1,4), (2,4), etc., but (2,5) not listed. Snake: (2,5) not occupied. Food not there. So L should be possible.\n\nR: right to (4,5). Similarly, should be fine.\n\nNow, I need to think ahead multiple turns.\n\nFirst, let's list the grid to visualize.\n\nGrid size: from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls at borders, so playable area is x=1 to 6? x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x from 1 to 6? Let's confirm.\n\n\"Border Cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7\" so cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. So the grid has walls on the outer rim. Internal cells are from x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, but y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y from 1 to 6.\n\nFor example, (1,1) to (6,6) might be playable, but need to check obstacles.\n\nInternal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3)\n\n(5,6): x=5,y=6\n\n(1,4): x=1,y=4\n\n(4,4): x=4,y=4\n\n(2,4): x=2,y=4\n\n(6,3): x=6,y=3\n\nSnake: head (3,5), body (3,4), tail (3,3) — all on x=3, y=5,4,3.\n\nFood: (2,2), (6,4), (6,6)\n\nLife spans: (2,2) has life span 4, meaning it disappears after 4 turns from now? \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n\nCurrent turn is t1=6, so for (2,2), life span 4, it will disappear at turn 6 + 4 - 1? Countdown decreases every turn including current.\n\n\"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" so at turn t, if life span is L, it decreases by 1 each turn, so it will be gone after L turns, meaning it exists for L more turns including current.\n\nFor example, at turn t, if life span L, then after turn t, it has L-1 left, and so on, until L=0, it disappears. So it can be eaten on turns when countdown >0.\n\n(2,2) life span 4 at turn 6: so on turn 6, countdown=4, turn 7:3, turn8:2, turn9:1, turn10:0 gone. So can be eaten until turn 9.\n\nSimilarly, (6,4) life span 5: turn6:5, turn7:4, ..., turn10:1, turn11:0 gone.\n\n(6,6) life span 8: turn6:8, ..., up to turn13:1, turn14:0 gone.\n\nNow, snake is short, length 3, so eating positive food increases length by 1.\n\nI need to plan moves to eat food while avoiding risks.\n\nFirst, possible moves from (3,5) with dir U:\n\n- U: to (3,6)\n\n- L: to (2,5)\n\n- R: to (4,5)\n\nCan't D.\n\nNow, after moving, the snake body moves: the tail moves forward, so new positions depend on direction.\n\nIf I move U to (3,6), new head (3,6), body: previous head (3,5) becomes body, then (3,4) becomes body, tail (3,3) is gone? Standard snake: when not eating, tail moves away, so positions: new head (3,6), then (3,5), (3,4). Length same since no food eaten.\n\nSimilarly, if move L to (2,5), new head (2,5), body (3,5), (3,4). Tail (3,3) is left.\n\nMove R to (4,5), head (4,5), body (3,5), (3,4).\n\nNow, I need to think about food.\n\nFood at (2,2), which is left and down, but snake is at (3,5), moving up, so (2,2) is not adjacent.\n\nSimilarly, (6,4) is right and down, (6,6) is right and up.\n\n(6,6) is at (6,6), which might be reachable.\n\nAlso, (6,4) is at (6,4).\n\nBut there are obstacles.\n\nLet me sketch the grid.\n\nY from 0 to 7, walls at y=0 and y=7, so y=1 to 6 are playable? y=0 and y=7 are walls, so cells with y=0 or y=7 are invalid. Similarly x=0 or x=7 invalid.\n\nSo valid cells: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? For example, (1,1) to (6,6).\n\n(1,1) is x=1,y=1, not border since borders are x=0,x=7,y=0,y=7, so (1,1) is playable, (1,6), (6,1), etc.\n\nInternal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3)\n\n(5,6): x=5,y=6\n\ny=6 is not wall, but (5,6) is obstacle.\n\nSimilarly, (1,4): x=1,y=4\n\n(4,4): x=4,y=4\n\n(2,4): x=2,y=4\n\n(6,3): x=6,y=3\n\nSnake: (3,5), (3,4), (3,3)\n\nFood: (2,2), (6,4), (6,6)\n\n(6,6) is at x=6,y=6, which is not wall, but is there obstacle? (5,6) is obstacle, but (6,6) is not listed as obstacle, so it should be free, but food is there.\n\n(6,6) has food, and no obstacle, so it's accessible.\n\nSimilarly, (6,4) has food, but (6,3) is obstacle, so (6,4) might be ok, but need to approach.\n\nNow, head at (3,5), moving U.\n\nIf I go U to (3,6), that's y=6, which is not wall. (3,6) is empty? Snake is at y=5,4,3, so (3,6) free. No food there.\n\nThen after moving, snake at (3,6), (3,5), (3,4). Head at (3,6), dir U if I went U.\n\nThen from there, possible moves U, L, R. U to (3,7) but y=7 is wall, so can't go U. So from (3,6), can go L to (2,6) or R to (4,6), or D to (3,5), but (3,5) is now body, so if go D, head to (3,5) which is body, collision. So cannot go D.\n\nSimilarly, L and R possible.\n\nBut (3,6) is at top row, y=6, so only L or R possible, or D but D is into body.\n\nSo from (3,6), only L or R.\n\nIf I go L to (2,6), or R to (4,6).\n\nBut I need to think about food.\n\n(6,6) is at (6,6), which is on the right, so moving right might be good.\n\nBut let's see the path.\n\nAlso, there's food at (6,4) and (2,2).\n\n(2,2) has shorter life span, only 4 turns left, so I might want to eat it soon.\n\nLife span 4 at turn 6, so must eat by turn 9.\n\nSimilarly, (6,4) life span 5, by turn 10.\n\n(6,6) life span 8, plenty of time.\n\nBut snake is at (3,5), (2,2) is at (2,2), which is left and down.\n\nFrom (3,5), if I go L to (2,5), then head at (2,5), dir L.\n\nThen from (2,5), I can go L, U, D. L to (1,5)? x=1 is not wall, since walls x=0 and x=7, so x=1 is playable. But obstacle at (1,4), but (1,5) not obstacle, so can go L to (1,5).\n\nU to (2,6), D to (2,4).\n\n(2,4) is obstacle? Internal obstacles include (2,4), so (2,4) is blocked, cannot go there.\n\nSo from (2,5), possible moves: L to (1,5), U to (2,6), D to (2,4) but (2,4) obstacle, so cannot. Also, R to (3,5) but that's body, collision, so cannot. So only L or U.\n\nIf I go U to (2,6), or L to (1,5).\n\nThen from there, to reach (2,2), I need to go down, but from (2,5) or (2,6), going down might be tricky.\n\nFrom (2,5), if I go L to (1,5), then from (1,5), I can go L? x=0 wall, cannot. U to (1,6), D to (1,4), but (1,4) is obstacle, so cannot. R to (2,5), body, no. So from (1,5), possible U to (1,6) or D to (1,4) but D not possible due to obstacle, so only U to (1,6)? But (1,4) is obstacle, so D not possible, so only U to (1,6) or... what about left? x=0 invalid. Right to (2,5) body. Down to (1,4) obstacle. So only up to (1,6).\n\n(1,6) is y=6, which is not wall, but y=7 is wall, so (1,6) is playable.\n\nThen from (1,6), only down or right, since U to (1,7) wall, L to (0,6) wall. So D to (1,5) or R to (2,6).\n\nBut (1,5) was previous position if I came from there, but not necessarily body now.\n\nThis seems messy for reaching (2,2).\n\nFrom (2,5), if I go U to (2,6), then from (2,6), can go L to (1,6), R to (3,6), D to (2,5) body, so L or R.\n\nThen to go down to (2,2), I need to go through (2,5) or something, but (2,4) is obstacle, so I cannot go directly down from (2,5) or (2,6) to (2,4) because obstacle at (2,4). So the column x=2 is blocked at y=4.\n\nSimilarly, (1,4) obstacle, so to reach (2,2), I need to go around.\n\nFor example, from (3,5), if I go L to (2,5), then I can go down? But (2,4) obstacle, so I must go left or up.\n\nThen from (1,5) or (2,6), I can go to (1,6) or (2,6), then from there, to reach (2,2), I need to go to left or down, but x=1,y=6, I can go down to (1,5), but then stuck because (1,4) obstacle, and (2,4) obstacle, so I cannot go below y=5 in columns x=1 or x=2? y=4 is blocked for x=1 and x=2.\n\n(2,2) is at y=2, so I need to approach from the side.\n\nFor example, from (3,3) or something, but snake is at (3,5) now.\n\nThe open cells around (2,2): (2,2) itself, (1,2), (2,1), (3,2), (2,3) etc.\n\n(2,3): is it obstacle? No, obstacles are (1,4),(2,4),(4,4),(5,6),(6,3), so (2,3) is free.\n\nSimilarly, (3,2), (1,2), etc.\n\nBut to reach (2,2), from current position, I might go down to (3,4), but (3,4) is body now, so I need to move away first.\n\nPerhaps I should consider moving right or up to access other areas.\n\nLet's think about (6,4) or (6,6).\n\nFirst, (6,6) is at top right.\n\nFrom (3,5), if I go R to (4,5), then head at (4,5), dir R.\n\nFrom (4,5), I can go U to (4,6), R to (5,5), D to (4,4), but (4,4) is obstacle, so cannot D. L to (3,5) body, no. So possible U or R.\n\nIf U to (4,6), then from (4,6), can go U to (4,7) wall, no; L to (3,6), R to (5,6), but (5,6) is obstacle, so cannot R. D to (4,5) body. So only L to (3,6).\n\nIf from (4,5) I go R to (5,5), then from (5,5), I can go U to (5,6), but (5,6) obstacle, so cannot. D to (5,4), R to (6,5), L to (4,5) body. So only D or R.\n\nD to (5,4), or R to (6,5).\n\n(6,5) is not obstacle, not wall.\n\nThen from (6,5), I can go to (6,6) or (6,4), etc.\n\n(6,4) has food, and (6,6) also.\n\nBut (6,3) is obstacle, so (6,4) might be accessible.\n\nSimilarly, (6,6) is accessible.\n\nNow, for (2,2), with short life span, I might prioritize it.\n\nBut to reach (2,2) from (3,5), I need to go left and down.\n\nBut as before, direct down is blocked by body and obstacle.\n\nAfter moving, the body moves.\n\nFor example, on turn 6, I move from (3,5) to a new position.\n\nIf I move L to (2,5), then new snake: head (2,5), body (3,5), (3,4). Tail (3,3) gone.\n\nThen at (2,5), as before, I can go L to (1,5) or U to (2,6).\n\nIf I go U to (2,6), then snake: head (2,6), body (2,5), (3,5)\n\nThen from (2,6), I can go L to (1,6) or R to (3,6).\n\nIf I go L to (1,6), head (1,6), body (2,6), (2,5)\n\nThen from (1,6), only D to (1,5) or R to (2,6) body, so D to (1,5)\n\nThen head (1,5), body (1,6), (2,6)\n\nBut (1,5) is at y=5, and I need to go down, but (1,4) is obstacle, so I cannot go down from here. I can only go up, but y=6 is max, so stuck? From (1,5), I can go U to (1,6) but that's body now, or R to (2,5), which might be free now? After moving to (1,5), the body is (1,6) and (2,6), so (2,5) is free.\n\nPositions: after moving to (1,5), snake is (1,5), (1,6), (2,6)\n\nSo (2,5) is empty.\n\nSo from (1,5), I can go R to (2,5)? (2,5) is empty, yes.\n\nGo to (2,5), then head (2,5), body (1,5), (1,6)\n\nThen from (2,5), I can go U to (2,6) but (2,6) is body, collision, or D to (2,4) obstacle, or L to (1,5) body, or R to (3,5) which might be free.\n\n(3,5) is not occupied now, so I can go R to (3,5).\n\nThen head (3,5), body (2,5), (1,5)\n\nBut I'm back to similar position, not closer to (2,2).\n\nThis is inefficient and I'm wasting turns.\n\nTo reach (2,2), I need to go to (3,4) or (3,3) but those are body, so I must move in a way that the body moves away.\n\nFor example, if I move down from (3,5), but I can't because no instant reverse; current direction U, so can't go D.\n\nSo I need to change direction.\n\nSuppose on turn 6, I go R to (4,5).\n\nThen snake: head (4,5), body (3,5), (3,4)  // tail (3,3) gone\n\nHead dir R.\n\nThen from (4,5), I can go U to (4,6) or R to (5,5)  (since D to (4,4) obstacle, L to (3,5) body)\n\nSay I go R to (5,5), then head (5,5), body (4,5), (3,5)\n\nDir R.\n\nFrom (5,5), can go D to (5,4) or R to (6,5)  (U to (5,6) obstacle, L to (4,5) body)\n\nIf I go R to (6,5), head (6,5), body (5,5), (4,5)\n\nThen from (6,5), I can go U to (6,6), D to (6,4), or L to (5,5) body. R to (7,5) wall, no. So U or D.\n\n(6,6) has food, (6,4) has food.\n\nIf I go U to (6,6), eat food, length increases to 4.\n\nThen new head (6,6), body (6,5), (5,5), (4,5)  // since ate food, tail doesn't move, so positions: new head at food, then previous head, then body.\n\nAfter eating, the new segment is added at head, so snake grows.\n\nPositions after eating at (6,6): head (6,6), then previous head (6,5), then (5,5), then (4,5). Length 4.\n\nDir U.\n\nThen from (6,6), can go D to (6,5) but (6,5) is body, collision. L to (5,6) but (5,6) obstacle. U to (6,7) wall. R to (7,6) wall. So no moves? Stuck!\n\nThat's bad. If I go to (6,6) and eat, then I have no escape because surrounded.\n\n(6,6) is cornered.\n\nU: (6,7) wall\n\nD: (6,5) body\n\nL: (5,6) obstacle\n\nR: (7,6) wall\n\nNo possible move, so death on next turn.\n\nSo I should not eat (6,6) if it leads to trap.\n\nBut in this case, from (6,5), if I go to (6,6), I die immediately after.\n\nSo better to go D to (6,4) instead.\n\nFrom (6,5), go D to (6,4).\n\n(6,4) has food, so eat it, length +1.\n\nNew head (6,4), body (6,5), (5,5), (4,5)\n\nDir D.\n\nThen from (6,4), can go U to (6,5) body, no; D to (6,3) but (6,3) obstacle, cannot; L to (5,4), R to (7,4) wall. So only possible L to (5,4).\n\n(5,4) is not obstacle, not wall.\n\nSo go L to (5,4).\n\nThen head (5,4), body (6,4), (6,5), (5,5)  // positions: new head (5,4), then previous head (6,4), then (6,5), then (5,5)\n\nDir L.\n\nFrom (5,4), can go U to (5,5) but (5,5) is body? (5,5) is part of body, so collision if go U. D to (5,3), L to (4,4) but (4,4) obstacle, cannot. R to (6,4) body, no. So only D to (5,3) if possible.\n\n(5,3) is not listed as obstacle, not wall, so should be ok.\n\nGo D to (5,3).\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBut this is one path.\n\nBack to turn 6.\n\nI need to consider the food at (2,2) with short life span.\n\nLife span 4 at turn 6, so must eat by turn 9.\n\nTurn 6,7,8,9 it exists.\n\nAfter turn 9, gone.\n\nSo I have 4 turns to eat it.\n\nFrom (3,5), (2,2) is 3 steps away in Manhattan distance, but with obstacles and body, it might take more turns.\n\nFor example, to go from (3,5) to (2,2), I need to go left and down, but down is blocked.\n\nI can go left to (2,5), then I need to go down, but (2,4) obstacle, so I must go to (1,5) or (2,6), then from there to (1,6), then down to (1,5), but then stuck.\n\nFrom (2,5), if I go to (1,5), then to (1,6), then to (2,6), then to (3,6), etc, but not down.\n\nTo go down, I need to go to x=3 or x=4.\n\nFor example, from (3,5), if I go R to (4,5), then I can go down to (4,4) but (4,4) obstacle, so cannot.\n\nFrom (4,5), go R to (5,5), then D to (5,4), then to (5,3), etc.\n\nBut (2,2) is far.\n\nPerhaps I can go to (3,3) but it's tail now.\n\nOn turn 6, if I move, the tail moves, so (3,3) is no longer there after move.\n\nAfter any move, the snake moves, so (3,3) is free after turn 6.\n\nFor example, on turn 6, if I move U to (3,6), then snake at (3,6), (3,5), (3,4). (3,3) is free.\n\nThen on turn 7, from (3,6), I can go L to (2,6) or R to (4,6).\n\nSay go L to (2,6), then snake (2,6), (3,6), (3,5)\n\nThen turn 8, from (2,6), go L to (1,6), snake (1,6), (2,6), (3,6)\n\nThen turn 9, from (1,6), go D to (1,5), snake (1,5), (1,6), (2,6)\n\nNow, (1,5) is head, and (2,2) is at (2,2), I need to go down, but (1,4) obstacle, so I can go R to (2,5) which is free.\n\nTurn 10, go R to (2,5), snake (2,5), (1,5), (1,6)\n\nBut (2,2) is at y=2, x=2, and at turn 10, but life span of (2,2) is only until turn 9, so on turn 10 it's gone. Turn 6: countdown 4, turn 7:3, turn8:2, turn9:1, turn10:0 gone. So on turn 9, it can be eaten, but on turn 9, I am at (1,5), and (2,2) is at (2,2), not adjacent. I can't reach it in time.\n\nFrom (1,5) on turn 9, I can go to (2,5), but (2,5) to (2,2) is not direct because of (2,4) obstacle.\n\nFrom (2,5), I can go to (3,5) or (2,6), but not down.\n\nSo I cannot reach (2,2) by turn 9 from this path.\n\nIf from (3,5) on turn 6, I go L to (2,5), then turn 6: head (2,5), body (3,5), (3,4)\n\nTurn 7, from (2,5), go U to (2,6), head (2,6), body (2,5), (3,5)\n\nTurn 8, from (2,6), go L to (1,6), head (1,6), body (2,6), (2,5)\n\nTurn 9, from (1,6), go D to (1,5), head (1,5), body (1,6), (2,6)\n\nAgain, at (1,5) on turn 9, (2,2) is not reachable.\n\nIf on turn 7 from (2,5), I go L to (1,5), then turn 7: head (1,5), body (2,5), (3,5)\n\nTurn 8, from (1,5), go U to (1,6), head (1,6), body (1,5), (2,5)\n\nTurn 9, from (1,6), go D to (1,5) body, or R to (2,6), head (2,6), body (1,6), (1,5)\n\nStill at (2,6) on turn 9, (2,2) not adjacent.\n\nSo it seems impossible to reach (2,2) by turn 9 with the current position and obstacles. The path is blocked by the obstacle at (2,4), and I can't go directly down from (2,5) or (2,6).\n\nPerhaps I can go down via other columns.\n\nFor example, from (3,5), go R to (4,5) on turn 6.\n\nThen turn 6: head (4,5), body (3,5), (3,4)\n\nTurn 7, from (4,5), go R to (5,5), head (5,5), body (4,5), (3,5)\n\nTurn 8, from (5,5), go D to (5,4), head (5,4), body (5,5), (4,5)\n\nTurn 9, from (5,4), go L to (4,4) but (4,4) obstacle, cannot; D to (5,3), or R to (6,4), etc.\n\nBut (2,2) is still far, at least 3 steps away in Manhattan, but with obstacles, more.\n\nFrom (5,4) to (2,2) is |5-2| + |4-2| = 3+2=5, too far for turn 9.\n\nSimilarly, other paths seem long.\n\nSo probably I cannot eat (2,2) before it disappears. Life span too short, and path blocked.\n\nSo I should give up on (2,2) and focus on other food.\n\nThen the other food: (6,4) and (6,6).\n\n(6,4) life span 5, so until turn 10 (turn6:5,7:4,8:3,9:2,10:1,11:0 gone)\n\n(6,6) life span 8, until turn 13.\n\nBoth accessible, but (6,6) is at corner, which might be risky.\n\nAs I saw earlier, if I go to (6,6), I might get trapped.\n\n(6,4) is better.\n\nAlso, there is a risk of tail reward danger, but here no food on tail.\n\nTail is at (3,3), no food there.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nNow, for long-term survival, I need to avoid dead ends.\n\nFrom current position (3,5), if I go U to (3,6), I am at top row, and only L or R possible, which might lead to corners.\n\nFor example, if I go U to (3,6), then turn 7, I can go L to (2,6) or R to (4,6).\n\nSay go R to (4,6), then head (4,6), body (3,6), (3,5)\n\nThen from (4,6), only L to (3,6) body or D to (4,5) or R to (5,6) but (5,6) obstacle, so only D to (4,5).\n\nGo D to (4,5), head (4,5), body (4,6), (3,6)\n\nThen from (4,5), as before, U to (4,6) body, D to (4,4) obstacle, L to (3,5) which might be free, or R to (5,5).\n\n(3,5) is free now, so go L to (3,5) or R to (5,5).\n\nBut this is not efficient.\n\nIf from (3,6) I go L to (2,6), similar.\n\nBut to reach (6,4) or (6,6), it's better to go right initially.\n\nSo on turn 6, go R to (4,5).\n\nThen as I thought earlier.\n\nLet's plan a sequence to eat (6,4).\n\nTurn 6: from (3,5) dir U, go R to (4,5). New head (4,5), dir R. Snake: (4,5), (3,5), (3,4)\n\nTurn 7: from (4,5), possible moves: U to (4,6), R to (5,5) (D and L not possible as before). Now, (4,6) is free, (5,5) is free.\n\nIf I go U to (4,6), then I am at top, might get stuck.\n\nBetter to go R to (5,5) to get closer to (6,4).\n\nGo R to (5,5). New head (5,5), dir R. Snake: (5,5), (4,5), (3,5)\n\nTurn 8: from (5,5), possible moves: D to (5,4), R to (6,5) (U and L not possible). (5,4) is free, (6,5) is free.\n\n(6,4) is below (6,5), so go D to (5,4) or R to (6,5).\n\nIf I go R to (6,5), then head (6,5), dir R. Snake: (6,5), (5,5), (4,5)\n\nTurn 9: from (6,5), can go U to (6,6) or D to (6,4).\n\nIf I go D to (6,4), eat food, since (6,4) has food. New length 4. Head (6,4), body (6,5), (5,5), (4,5) dir D.\n\nThen as before, from (6,4), only L to (5,4) possible.\n\nGo L to (5,4). Head (5,4), dir L. Snake: (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5)\n\nTurn 10: from (5,4), can go U to (5,5) but (5,5) is body, collision; D to (5,3); L to (4,4) obstacle; R to (6,4) body. So only D to (5,3).\n\nGo D to (5,3). Head (5,3), dir D. Snake: (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5)\n\n(5,5) is gone.\n\nThen from (5,3), I can go U to (5,4) body, no; D to (5,2); L to (4,3); R to (6,3) but (6,3) obstacle, cannot. So D or L.\n\nGo D to (5,2) or L to (4,3), etc.\n\nNow, there is food at (6,6) which is still available.\n\nBut (6,6) is at (6,6), from (5,3), it's far.\n\nI could have eaten (6,6) instead, but it's risky.\n\nOn turn 9 at (6,5), I could go U to (6,6) to eat it.\n\nBut as before, if I go to (6,6), I eat, grow to length 4, head (6,6), body (6,5), (5,5), (4,5)\n\nThen no move possible, die.\n\nSo I should not eat (6,6) because it's a dead end.\n\nTherefore, better to eat (6,4) as above.\n\nNow, back to turn 8: at (5,5), I could go D to (5,4) instead of R to (6,5).\n\nTurn 8: from (5,5) go D to (5,4). Head (5,4), dir D. Snake: (5,4), (5,5), (4,5)\n\n(3,5) gone? After move, positions: new head (5,4), then previous head (5,5), then (4,5), so body (5,5), (4,5)\n\nThen turn 9: from (5,4), can go D to (5,3), L to (4,4) obstacle, R to (6,4), U to (5,5) body. So D or R.\n\n(6,4) has food, so go R to (6,4) to eat.\n\nGo R to (6,4), eat, new head (6,4), dir R? Moved right, so dir R. Snake: (6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5) length 4.\n\nThen from (6,4), as before, only L to (5,4) but (5,4) is body, collision! Oh no.\n\nAfter eating at (6,4), positions: head at (6,4), then previous head (5,4), then (5,5), then (4,5).\n\nSo (5,4) is body now.\n\nFrom (6,4), possible moves:\n\nU to (6,5) - is it free? In this sequence, on turn 9, when I move to (6,4), the body is (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), so (6,5) is free? Not occupied.\n\nIn turn 9: before move, snake is at (5,4), (5,5), (4,5)\n\nI move R to (6,4), which has food, so new head (6,4), and since ate, tail doesn't move, so new positions: (6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5)\n\n(4,5) is the last body segment.\n\nNow, from (6,4), adjacent cells:\n\nU: (6,5) - not occupied, not wall, not obstacle? (6,5) should be free. Walls: x=7 wall, but (6,5) x=6<7. Obstacles: (6,3) obstacle, not (6,5). So (6,5) free.\n\nD: (6,3) obstacle, cannot\n\nL: (5,4) but (5,4) is body, collision, cannot\n\nR: (7,4) wall, cannot\n\nSo only U to (6,5) possible.\n\nGo U to (6,5).\n\nThen head (6,5), dir U. Snake: (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5)\n\n(4,5) gone? After move, new head (6,5), then previous head (6,4), then (5,4), then (5,5). Length 4.\n\nNow, from (6,5), can go U to (6,6), D to (6,4) body, L to (5,5) body, R to (7,5) wall. So only U to (6,6) if I want.\n\n(6,6) has food, but if I go there, I might get stuck.\n\nGo U to (6,6), eat, new head (6,6), body (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5) length 5.\n\nThen from (6,6), no moves, as before, die.\n\nSo better not to go to (6,6).\n\nFrom (6,5), after moving up, I can only go to (6,6) or nowhere, but (6,6) is food, but dangerous.\n\nIn this position, from (6,5), I have to go U to (6,6), then die.\n\nBut in this sequence, I ended up at (6,5) with no choice but to go up to death.\n\nThat's bad.\n\nIn the first sequence, when I went to (6,5) on turn 8, then to (6,4) on turn 9, then to (5,4) on turn 10, etc., it was better.\n\nLet's compare the sequences.\n\nFirst sequence (go to (6,5) early):\n\nTurn 6: R to (4,5)\n\nTurn 7: R to (5,5)\n\nTurn 8: R to (6,5)  // at (6,5)\n\nTurn 9: D to (6,4) eat, then head (6,4), body (6,5), (5,5), (4,5)\n\nThen only L to (5,4) possible? From (6,4), U to (6,5) body, D to (6,3) obstacle, L to (5,4), R wall. (5,4) is free? Positions: body is (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), so (5,4) is free.\n\nGo L to (5,4). Head (5,4), body (6,4), (6,5), (5,5)\n\nThen from (5,4), can go D to (5,3) or U to (5,5) body, L to (4,4) obstacle, R to (6,4) body. So only D to (5,3).\n\nThen to (5,3), etc.\n\nNo immediate death.\n\nSecond sequence, when I went to (5,4) on turn 8, then to (6,4) on turn 9, I got stuck at (6,4) with only U to (6,5), then forced to (6,6).\n\nSo the first sequence is safer.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to output actions for multiple turns, at least 5 turns ahead.\n\nCurrent turn t1=6.\n\nPlan actions for turn 6,7,8,9,10,...\n\nBut since I don't know beyond, I should plan a sequence.\n\nAlso, there is (6,6) food, which I can eat later if possible, but it's risky.\n\nPerhaps avoid it for now.\n\nAnother idea: since (2,2) is not reachable, and (6,4) is good, but after eating, I need to go to open space.\n\nThe bottom left might be open.\n\nFor example, after eating (6,4), I can go to (5,3), (5,2), etc.\n\n(6,6) can be eaten later, but I need to approach from the side or something, but it's cornered.\n\nUnless I don't eat it, but it has value, so if possible.\n\nBut with the obstacles, it might be hard.\n\nPerhaps for now, focus on (6,4).\n\nSo let's plan to eat (6,4) safely.\n\nFrom turn 6: start at (3,5) dir U.\n\nAction turn 6: R to (4,5)  // now head (4,5) dir R\n\nTurn 7: from (4,5), go R to (5,5)  // head (5,5) dir R\n\nTurn 8: from (5,5), go R to (6,5)  // head (6,5) dir R\n\nNow at (6,5), (6,4) is below, but I need to go down.\n\nBut on turn 9, I can go D to (6,4) to eat.\n\nBut after eating, from (6,4), I can go L to (5,4) as before.\n\nBut (5,4) might be occupied or not.\n\nIn turn 8, snake is at (6,5), (5,5), (4,5)\n\n(5,4) is free.\n\nTurn 9: go D to (6,4) eat. New head (6,4), body (6,5), (5,5), (4,5)  // length 4\n\nNow, from (6,4), possible moves: U to (6,5) body, D to (6,3) obstacle, L to (5,4), R wall. Only L to (5,4).\n\nGo L to (5,4). Head (5,4), dir L. Snake: (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5)  // body (6,4), (6,5), (5,5)\n\n(4,5) gone? After move, new head (5,4), then previous head (6,4), then (6,5), then (5,5). So positions (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5)\n\n(5,5) is the tail.\n\nTurn 10: from (5,4), can go U to (5,5) but (5,5) is body, collision; D to (5,3); L to (4,4) obstacle; R to (6,4) body. So only D to (5,3).\n\nGo D to (5,3). Head (5,3), dir D. Snake: (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5)\n\nThen turn 11: from (5,3), can go U to (5,4) body, D to (5,2), L to (4,3), R to (6,3) obstacle. So D or L.\n\nSay go D to (5,2) to go down.\n\nAnd so on.\n\n(6,6) is still there, but I can decide later if to go for it.\n\nSince life span is long, I might avoid it if dangerous.\n\nNow for the answer, I need to output actions for turn 6 to, say, turn 10 or more.\n\nBut the state might change, but since I have to plan, I'll output a sequence.\n\nAlso, on turn 6, I could go U or L, but going R seems best to reach food.\n\nIf I go L, I might go to left, but no food there, and (2,2) unreachable, so not good.\n\nGo U to (3,6), then I am at top, limited moves.\n\nFor example, turn 6: U to (3,6)\n\nTurn 7: from (3,6), go R to (4,6)  // for example\n\nThen similar to before, but not closer to food.\n\nSo R is better.\n\nThus, I think for turn 6, action R.\n\nThen for subsequent turns.\n\nIn the sequence above, turn 6: R\n\nTurn 7: from (4,5) go R to (5,5)\n\nTurn 8: from (5,5) go R to (6,5)\n\nTurn 9: from (6,5) go D to (6,4) eat\n\nTurn 10: from (6,4) go L to (5,4)\n\nBut on turn 10, from (6,4) to (5,4), as above.\n\nThen turn 11: from (5,4) go D to (5,3), etc.\n\nBut for the answer, I need to specify up to a certain point.\n\nThe core rules say \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", so at least 5 turns.\n\nCurrent turn 6, so plan for turns 6 to 10 or 11.\n\nAlso, in the output format, it should be like:\n\nTurn 6: action\n\nTurn 7: action\n\n...\n\nIn the sequence, turn 9 I eat food, which is good.\n\nBut on turn 10, I go to (5,4), which is fine.\n\nNow, to confirm the grid.\n\nAnother thing: on turn 8, at (5,5), I go to (6,5), but (6,5) is adjacent to (6,4) food, but I don't eat it yet, I eat on turn 9.\n\nAlso, is there any risk?\n\nTail reward danger: but no food on tail, so ok.\n\nNow, the food at (6,6) is still there, but I can ignore it for now.\n\nPerhaps later I can go for it if possible, but it might not be necessary.\n\nFor long-term, after turn 10, I can explore other areas.\n\nBut for the plan, I think the sequence is ok.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 6: R (right)\n\nTurn 7: R (right) to (5,5)\n\nTurn 8: R (right) to (6,5)\n\nTurn 9: D (down) to (6,4) eat\n\nTurn 10: L (left) to (5,4)\n\nBut after turn 10, I go to (5,4), but in the snake position, after turn 10: head at (5,4), with body.\n\nThen turn 11: from (5,4), I can go D to (5,3), as I said.\n\nBut for the answer, since it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I should provide at least 5 actions, so up to turn 10 or 11.\n\nTurn 6 to 10 is 5 actions: turn 6,7,8,9,10.\n\nThat should be fine.\n\nIn turn 10 action, I have L to (5,4), which is valid.\n\nTo be precise.\n\nIn the output, I need to specify the direction.\n\nAlso, the head direction changes.\n\nBut in the action, I just need to output the move.\n\nSo for turn 6: R\n\nTurn 7: R\n\nTurn 8: R\n\nTurn 9: D\n\nTurn 10: L\n\nThen beyond, I can add turn 11: D, for example.\n\nBut perhaps 5 actions are enough.\n\nSince turn 9 I eat, and turn 10 I move to safety.\n\nNow, about the life span: (6,4) eaten on turn 9, life span was 5 at turn 6, so on turn 9, countdown should be 2? Turn 6: life span 5, so countdown 5.\n\nAfter each turn, countdown decreases.\n\nTurn 6: countdown=5 for (6,4)\n\nTurn 7: countdown=4\n\nTurn 8: countdown=3\n\nTurn 9: countdown=2, so still exists, I eat it.\n\nYes.\n\nSimilarly, (6,6) still there.\n\nBut I don't plan to eat it.\n\nSo I think this is a good plan.\n\nIf on turn 6 I go U, it might not be better.\n\nFor example, turn 6: U to (3,6)\n\nThen turn 7: from (3,6) go R to (4,6)\n\nTurn 8: from (4,6) go D to (4,5)  // only choice\n\nTurn 9: from (4,5) go R to (5,5)\n\nThen at (5,5), similar to before, but later.\n\nThen to reach (6,4), I need more turns.\n\nNot efficient.\n\nSo R is better.\n\nTherefore, I'll go with the sequence.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score and ensure long-term survival, the plan prioritizes eating the positive food at (6,4) due to its moderate life span (5 turns remaining) and safer accessibility compared to (6,6), which poses a high risk of trapping the snake in a dead end. The food at (2,2) is ignored because its short life span (4 turns) and obstacles (e.g., at (2,4)) make it unreachable within the time frame. The snake starts at (3,5) moving upward, and the sequence focuses on moving rightward to approach (6,4) efficiently while avoiding walls, obstacles, and collisions.\n\nAfter eating (6,4) on turn 9, the sequence continues to move the snake away from the risky top-right corner toward the safer bottom area. This plan considers at least 5 turns ahead (turns 6 to 11) to ensure survival beyond immediate rewards.\n\n### Detailed Plan:\n- **Turn 6 (current)**: Move right (R) to (4,5). This avoids moving up into the constrained top row and begins the approach toward the food at (6,4). The new head position is (4,5), direction right. Snake positions: [(4,5), (3,5), (3,4)].\n- **Turn 7**: Move right (R) to (5,5). This continues the rightward path, getting closer to (6,4). The new head position is (5,5), direction right. Snake positions: [(5,5), (4,5), (3,5)].\n- **Turn 8**: Move right (R) to (6,5). This positions the snake adjacent to (6,4), setting up the food consumption on the next turn. The new head position is (6,5), direction right. Snake positions: [(6,5), (5,5), (4,5)].\n- **Turn 9**: Move down (D) to (6,4) to eat the positive food. This increases the snake length to 4. The new head position is (6,4), direction down. Snake positions: [(6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5)].\n- **Turn 10**: Move left (L) to (5,4). This escapes the potential trap near (6,6) and moves toward open space. The new head position is (5,4), direction left. Snake positions: [(5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5)].\n- **Turn 11**: Move down (D) to (5,3). This continues into the safer bottom area, avoiding obstacles and walls. The new head position is (5,3), direction down. Snake positions: [(5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5)].\n\n### Why this plan?\n- **Food prioritization**: (6,4) is eaten on turn 9 (countdown: turn 6=5, turn 7=4, turn 8=3, turn 9=2), utilizing its life span efficiently. (6,6) is avoided due to the risk of immediate death after eating (e.g., no escape from (6,6)). (2,2) is unreachable by turn 9 due to obstacles and Manhattan distance.\n- **Risk avoidance**: Moving right initially avoids the top row and left-side obstacles. After eating, moving left and down prevents corner traps and body collisions. The path ensures the snake remains in open areas for future turns.\n- **Long-term survival**: By turn 11, the snake is in the bottom-middle (e.g., (5,3)), with access to open cells like (5,2), (4,3), or (6,3) (if not an obstacle), allowing further exploration. No food is eaten recklessly (e.g., (6,6) is skipped).\n- **Collision safety**: All moves respect movement constraints (no instant reverse) and avoid walls, obstacles, and body segments. Tail reward danger is irrelevant here as no food is on the tail.\n\nThis sequence scores +1 (from (6,4)) and sets up potential for more points while minimizing risk.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 6: R (right)\nTurn 7: R (right)\nTurn 8: R (right)\nTurn 9: D (down)\nTurn 10: L (left)\nTurn 11: D (down)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 7, and I'm playing Snake on a grid. The walls are at the borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the grid is from (0,0) to (7,7), and walls are on those borders. Also, there are internal obstacles at: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3). So I must avoid those.\n\nThe snake positions are: head at (4,5), then body at (3,5), and tail at (3,4). So the snake has three segments. Head direction is right, meaning it was moving right to get to (4,5) from (3,5), I assume.\n\nFood items:\n\n- (2,2) with life span 3, value +1\n\n- (6,4) with life span 4, value +1\n\n- (6,6) with life span 7, value +1\n\n- (1,5) with life span 10, value +1\n\nAll food is positive, value +1, so no negative food here. But I need to be careful with life spans; they decrease each turn, including this one.\n\nLife span: for (2,2), life span 3, meaning it disappears after 3 turns, starting from now? The input says \"life_span\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so for (2,2), at turn 7, life span 3, so it will disappear after turn 9 (since turn 7,8,9, gone after turn 9). Let's clarify:\n\n- Turn 7: life span 3\n\n- After turn 7, it decreases to 2\n\n- After turn 8, to 1\n\n- After turn 9, to 0, so it disappears before turn 10? I think \"disappears after N turns\" means after N turns from now, it's gone. So for (2,2) with life span 3 at turn 7, it will be there on turns 7,8,9, and disappear before turn 10.\n\nSimilarly:\n\n- (6,4): life span 4 at turn 7, so present on turns 7,8,9,10, disappear before 11.\n\n- (6,6): life span 7, present on turns 7 to 13, disappear before 14.\n\n- (1,5): life span 10, present on turns 7 to 16, disappear before 17.\n\nNow, snake head at (4,5), direction right. So from (4,5), possible moves: up, down, left, right? But no instant reverse: since it's moving right, it cannot move left immediately, because that would be opposite direction. Current direction is R, so cannot move L next.\n\nAllowed moves: U, D, R (since L is opposite).\n\nNow, grid is 8x8? x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7, so 8 cells each, but walls on borders, so playable area is x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? No, walls are at x=0,x=7,y=0,y=7, so cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls, so snake can be on x=1 to 6, y=1 to6? Let's confirm.\n\n\"Border Cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7.\" So any cell with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 is a wall, so the playable grid is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think, but internal obstacles also.\n\nInternal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3)\n\nSo, cells to avoid: walls and obstacles.\n\nNow, snake positions: head (4,5), body (3,5), tail (3,4). So the body segments occupy (3,5) and (3,4).\n\nFood at (2,2), (6,4), (6,6), (1,5)\n\nI need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score, prioritizing long-term survival.\n\nFirst, let's list possible moves from current position (4,5):\n\n- Up (U): (4,6) - is this valid? y=6, but y=7 is wall, y=6 is not border? Borders are y=0 and y=7, so y=6 is within 1 to 6, I think. Playable area: since walls at y=0 and y=7, cells y=1 to y=6 are free, except obstacles. Similarly x=1 to x=6.\n\nSo (4,6): is it occupied or wall? (4,6) not listed in obstacles, and y=6 <7, so should be free? But let's check obstacles: obstacles are (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3). (4,6) not among them, so free.\n\nBut is there a body part? Snake is at (4,5), (3,5), (3,4). (4,6) is not occupied by snake.\n\n- Down (D): (4,4) - but (4,4) is an obstacle! Internal obstacle at (4,4), so cannot move there.\n\n- Left (L): (3,5) - but (3,5) is the body segment. Can I move there? Movement constraints: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nHere, (3,5) is the second segment, not the tail. Tail is at (3,4). So moving to (3,5) would be head touching body, which is collision, deadly.\n\nSimilarly, moving to a body segment other than tail is collision.\n\nOnly if moving to the tail cell, and tail moves away, it might be ok.\n\nHere, (3,5) is the body, not tail. Tail is (3,4). So moving left to (3,5) would collide with body.\n\n- Right (R): (5,5) - is this free? (5,5) not in obstacles, not wall, and not occupied by snake. Snake is at (4,5), (3,5), (3,4). So (5,5) should be free.\n\nAlso, direction is R, so moving right is allowed.\n\nSo possible moves: U to (4,6), R to (5,5), and D is to (4,4) which is obstacle, so invalid. L to (3,5) is body collision, invalid. So only U or R possible.\n\nNow, need to think ahead.\n\nFirst, let's map the grid for clarity.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, but walls at x=0,7 and y=0,7, so cells (x,y) with 1<=x<=6, 1<=y<=6 are playable, except obstacles.\n\nObstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3)\n\nSnake: head (4,5), body (3,5), tail (3,4)\n\nFood: (2,2), (6,4), (6,6), (1,5)\n\n(1,5) is at x=1,y=5. Is this accessible? y=5, x=1, which is not border, and not listed as obstacle? Obstacles are (1,4), but (1,5) is different, so should be free.\n\nSimilarly, (6,4) at x=6,y=4, but obstacle at (6,3), not (6,4), so free? (6,4) not obstacle.\n\n(6,4) is a food position, not obstacle.\n\nNow, life spans: food at (2,2) disappears after turn 9, so only 3 turns left (t7,t8,t9)\n\n(6,4) disappears after turn 10 (life span 4 at t7, so t7,t8,t9,t10)\n\n(6,6) after turn 13\n\n(1,5) after turn 16\n\nSince snake has 3 segments, eating food will increase length by 1, so to +4 segments.\n\nNow, I need to plan moves for multiple turns.\n\nCurrent turn t=7, I need to output actions for turn 7,8,9,... but how many? The answer format says \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" but it doesn't specify how many turns to output. Since it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I should output at least 5 actions? But the state might change, and food might disappear, so I need to simulate.\n\nThe instruction is to think ahead, but output the actions starting from t1.\n\nAlso, since I'm to maximize score, I should aim to eat food safely.\n\nFirst, let's consider immediate options at t7.\n\nFrom (4,5), I can go U to (4,6) or R to (5,5).\n\nIf I go U to (4,6):\n\n- Then head at (4,6). Snake becomes [(4,6), (4,5), (3,5)] and tail moves away from (3,4), so (3,4) is now free? After move, positions: head to (4,6), then previous head (4,5) becomes body, and tail (3,4) is removed? No, when moving, the tail moves only if no food eaten.\n\nIf I don't eat food, snake moves to new head, and tail is removed.\n\nHere, at (4,6), is there food? Food positions: (2,2), (6,4), (6,6), (1,5) — (4,6) not listed, so no food. So after moving to (4,6), snake is [(4,6), (4,5), (3,5)] and (3,4) is free now.\n\nThen, from (4,6), possible moves: U, D, L, R, but no reverse? What is the new direction? After moving U, head direction is U, so cannot move D next.\n\nSimilarly, if I move R to (5,5), no food there, so snake becomes [(5,5), (4,5), (3,5)], and (3,4) free.\n\nDirection R.\n\nNow, let's think about food access.\n\nFood at (1,5) is close, at (1,5). From (4,5), to reach (1,5), I need to go left, but left is blocked by body at (3,5), and I can't move left now.\n\nSimilarly, (2,2) is at bottom-left, (6,4) and (6,6) are top-right.\n\n(6,4) is at x=6,y=4, (6,6) at x=6,y=6.\n\nAlso, (1,5) at x=1,y=5.\n\nNow, life span of (2,2) is short, only 3 turns, so it might disappear soon.\n\nBut (2,2) is far from current position. From (4,5) to (2,2) is distance |4-2| + |5-2| = 2+3=5 moves, but with obstacles, it might be longer.\n\nSimilarly, (6,4) is closer: from (4,5) to (6,4) is |4-6| + |5-4| = 2+1=3 moves? But need to check path.\n\n(6,4) is at (6,4), which is near the right border.\n\nBut there is an obstacle at (6,3), but (6,4) is free.\n\nAlso, (6,6) is at (6,6), and obstacle at (5,6), which is adjacent.\n\n(5,6) is obstacle, so (6,6) might be tricky to reach.\n\n(1,5) is at (1,5), and obstacle at (1,4), but (1,5) is free.\n\nNow, let's consider the two choices at t7.\n\nOption 1: Move U to (4,6)\n\nThen at t7, snake at [(4,6), (4,5), (3,5)]\n\nDirection U.\n\nNow t8, from (4,6), possible moves: U, D, L, R, but cannot D (reverse), so U, L, R.\n\nU to (4,7): but y=7 is wall, cannot move there. So invalid.\n\nD: cannot, reverse.\n\nL to (3,6)\n\nR to (5,6)\n\n(5,6) is an obstacle! Internal obstacle at (5,6), so cannot move there.\n\nSo from (4,6), only possible move is L to (3,6), since U and R are invalid or blocked.\n\nU to (4,7) wall, R to (5,6) obstacle, D not allowed, so only L to (3,6).\n\n(3,6) should be free? Not wall, not obstacle, not occupied.\n\nAfter t7 move, snake is at (4,6), (4,5), (3,5), so (3,6) free.\n\nSo at t8, must move L to (3,6).\n\nThen snake head to (3,6), body (4,6), (4,5), tail (3,5) removed? No food at (3,6), so snake becomes [(3,6), (4,6), (4,5)]\n\nDirection L.\n\nNow t9, from (3,6), possible moves: U, D, L, R, but cannot R (reverse), so U, D, L.\n\nU to (3,7): y=7 wall, invalid.\n\nD to (3,5): but (3,5) is now a body segment? Current positions: head (3,6), body (4,6), (4,5). (3,5) is free now, since tail moved.\n\nAfter t8 move, positions: head (3,6), then previous head (4,6) becomes body, and (4,5) is body, and (3,5) was removed when moving to (3,6) since no food.\n\nAt t8 start: positions [(4,6), (4,5), (3,5)]\n\nMove to (3,6), so new head (3,6), then body (4,6), and (4,5), and (3,5) is removed. So snake now [(3,6), (4,6), (4,5)]\n\n(3,5) is free.\n\nNow from (3,6), moves:\n\nU to (3,7): wall, invalid.\n\nD to (3,5): (3,5) is free, so can move? But is it safe? Moving to (3,5), which is not occupied, so ok.\n\nBut direction: after moving L to (3,6), direction is L, so moving D or U or L is allowed, not R.\n\nD to (3,5): possible.\n\nL to (2,6): possible.\n\nR to (4,6): but (4,6) is body segment, so collision if move there.\n\n(4,6) is the first body segment, so head moving to (4,6) would touch body, deadly.\n\nSo cannot R.\n\nThus possible: D to (3,5) or L to (2,6).\n\nIf move D to (3,5): then at (3,5), no food, snake becomes [(3,5), (3,6), (4,6)] and (4,5) free.\n\nThen from there, etc. But I need to see if I can reach food.\n\nThis path seems to be going to the left-top, but food is not there except (1,5) which is at (1,5), y=5.\n\n(1,5) is at bottom, y=5, x=1.\n\nFrom (3,6), if I move L to (2,6), then to (1,6), but (1,6) might be free, but food is at (1,5), not (1,6).\n\nAnd (2,2) is low.\n\nBut let's not get ahead; this is one option.\n\nFirst, back to t7, if I move U, I end up at (3,6) at t8, then I have to move to (3,5) or (2,6) at t9.\n\nBut (3,5) is where the body was, but it's free now.\n\nFood at (1,5) is close, at (1,5), from (3,5) I can go left to (2,5) then (1,5), but need to check obstacles.\n\n(2,5): is it free? Obstacles at (1,4), (2,4), (4,4), etc. (2,5) not listed, so should be free.\n\nSimilarly, (1,5) is food, not obstacle.\n\nBut at t7, if I go U, I might not be able to reach (1,5) soon.\n\nLet's consider the other option at t7: move R to (5,5)\n\nAt t7, move R to (5,5), no food, so snake becomes [(5,5), (4,5), (3,5)], and (3,4) free. Direction R.\n\nNow t8, from (5,5), direction R, so possible moves: U, D, R (cannot L, reverse).\n\nU to (5,6): but (5,6) is obstacle! Internal obstacle at (5,6), so cannot move there.\n\nD to (5,4): (5,4) should be free? Not wall, not obstacle (obstacles are (5,6),(1,4),(4,4),(2,4),(6,3)), so (5,4) free.\n\nR to (6,5): (6,5) should be free, x=6<7, y=5, not border, not obstacle (obstacle at (6,3), not (6,5)).\n\nSo possible moves: D to (5,4) or R to (6,5).\n\nCannot U to (5,6) obstacle.\n\nNow, food at (6,4) is close; (6,4) is at (6,4), which is down from (5,5)? (5,5) to (6,4) is not direct, it's diagonal, but moves are horizontal/vertical.\n\nFrom (5,5), to reach (6,4), I can go R to (6,5), then D to (6,4), or D to (5,4), then R to (6,4).\n\n(6,4) has food with life span 4, so at t7, it has until t10.\n\nSimilarly, (6,6) is at (6,6), which is up, but (5,6) is obstacle, so from (5,5), I cannot go U to (5,6), so I need to go around.\n\n(6,6) can be reached from (6,5) or (5,6), but (5,6) blocked, so from (6,5) to (6,6).\n\nBut (6,6) has longer life span.\n\nAlso, (1,5) is on the left, but far.\n\nNow, at t8, from (5,5), if I move R to (6,5), then head at (6,5), snake [(6,5), (5,5), (4,5)], direction R.\n\nThen at t9, from (6,5), direction R, possible moves: U, D, L (cannot R, since x=6, R would be x=7 wall, but even if not, cannot reverse? Direction R, so cannot L? Reverse of R is L.\n\nCurrent direction after moving R to (6,5) is R.\n\nSo at t9, from (6,5), cannot move L (opposite), so can move U, D, R.\n\nR to (7,5): but x=7 wall, invalid.\n\nU to (6,6): (6,6) is food position, so possible.\n\nD to (6,4): (6,4) is food position.\n\nBoth U and D are possible.\n\nIf U to (6,6), eat food, snake grows to length 4: head to (6,6), body (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), so positions [(6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5)]\n\nThen direction U.\n\nSimilarly, if D to (6,4), eat food, grow to [(6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5)], direction D.\n\nBut at (6,5), moving U or D.\n\nIf I move D to (6,4) at t9, I eat food.\n\nLife span of (6,4) is 4 at t7, so at t8, life span 3, t9 life span 2, so still there at t9.\n\nSimilarly, (6,6) life span 7, at t9 still there.\n\nNow, back to t8 choice.\n\nIf at t8 from (5,5) I move D to (5,4) instead.\n\nThen at t8, head to (5,4), no food there, snake [(5,4), (5,5), (4,5)], direction D.\n\nThen at t9, from (5,4), direction D, possible moves: L, R, D (cannot U, reverse).\n\nD to (5,3): (5,3) should be free? Not wall, not obstacle (obstacle at (6,3), not (5,3)).\n\nL to (4,4): but (4,4) is obstacle! Cannot.\n\nR to (6,4): (6,4) is food, so possible.\n\nSo from (5,4), can move D to (5,3) or R to (6,4).\n\nIf R to (6,4), eat food, grow to [(6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5)] or something.\n\nLet's sequence: after move to (5,4) at t8, positions [(5,4), (5,5), (4,5)]\n\nMove R to (6,4) at t9, new head (6,4), which has food, so snake grows: head (6,4), then body (5,4), (5,5), and since food eaten, tail not removed, so add new segment, positions [(6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5)]\n\nLength now 4.\n\nDirection R.\n\nNow, comparing the two paths from t7 move R.\n\nIf at t7 move R to (5,5), then at t8 if move R to (6,5), then at t9 I can go to (6,6) or (6,4) to eat.\n\nIf at t8 move D to (5,4), then at t9 move R to (6,4) to eat.\n\nBoth can lead to eating (6,4) or (6,6) soon.\n\nBut (6,4) and (6,6) are both accessible.\n\nNow, what about the other food? (2,2) is at (2,2), with short life span. At t7, life span 3, so after t7, it will be there for t8 and t9, disappear before t10.\n\nFrom current position, to reach (2,2), it's at least 5 moves: from (4,5) to (2,2) is |4-2| + |5-2| = 2+3=5, but with obstacles, might be longer.\n\nFor example, to go to (2,2), I need to go left and down.\n\nBut at t7, I can only go U or R, not down or left directly.\n\nIf I go U, as in first option, I went to (4,6), then to (3,6), etc, which is away from (2,2).\n\nIf I go R to (5,5), then to (6,5) or (5,4), also away.\n\nSo from (4,5), (2,2) is not reachable in 2 turns; at best, from (4,5) to (3,5) but cannot, or to (4,4) obstacle, or down not possible.\n\nSo at t7, I cannot go directly towards (2,2).\n\nThe shortest path: from (4,5), I need to go to (3,5) but blocked, or to (4,4) obstacle, so I have to go around.\n\nFor example, go R to (5,5), then D to (5,4), then L to (4,4) but obstacle, cannot.\n\n(4,4) obstacle, so from (5,4), I can go L to (4,4) invalid, or D to (5,3), etc, but to reach (2,2), it might take many turns.\n\nSimilarly, from (4,6) or (3,6), it's even farther.\n\nSo (2,2) might not be reachable before it disappears, given the constraints. Life span 3 at t7, so only t7,t8,t9 it exists. At t7 I can't reach it, at t8 I might be at (5,5) or (4,6), still far, at t9 even if I move towards, but from (5,5) to (2,2) is at least 3+3=6 moves? |5-2| + |5-2| =3+3=6, but with obstacles, impossible to reach in 2 turns from t8 position.\n\nSimilarly from (4,6), |4-2| + |6-2| =2+4=6 moves, not possible in t8 and t9.\n\nSo (2,2) cannot be eaten; it will disappear without being eaten. So I should ignore it for now.\n\nSimilarly, (1,5) is at (1,5), life span 10, plenty of time.\n\nBut from current position, to reach (1,5), I need to go left, but immediate left is blocked.\n\nIf I go U to (4,6), then to (3,6), then to (2,6) or (3,5), etc.\n\nFrom (3,5), I can go to (2,5) then (1,5).\n\n(2,5) and (1,5) should be free.\n\nBut obstacles at (1,4) and (2,4), but (1,5) and (2,5) are different cells.\n\n(1,5) is food, so not obstacle.\n\nSimilarly, (2,5) free.\n\nNow, from (4,5) at t7, if I go U to (4,6), t8 must go L to (3,6), then at t9 I can go D to (3,5) or L to (2,6).\n\nIf go D to (3,5), then at (3,5), no food, snake positions: let's say at t9, after move to (3,5), from (3,6) to (3,5), direction D, snake [(3,5), (3,6), (4,6)] or something.\n\nt8: after move to (3,6), positions [(3,6), (4,6), (4,5)]\n\nt9 move D to (3,5): head (3,5), body (3,6), (4,6), and (4,5) removed? No food, so snake [(3,5), (3,6), (4,6)]\n\nThen from (3,5), I can go L to (2,5), then to (1,5) at t10 or t11.\n\n(1,5) has life span 10, so at t10 it will be there (since t7:10, t8:9, t9:8, t10:7, etc., still there).\n\nBut if I go to (2,5) at t10, then (1,5) at t11, eat.\n\nBut at (1,5), when I eat, I need to be careful if tail is adjacent or something, but probably not immediate issue.\n\nIf at t9 from (3,6) I go L to (2,6), then to (1,6) or down, but (1,5) is at y=5, so I need to go down from (2,6) to (2,5) then (1,5).\n\nSimilar.\n\nBut going towards (1,5) via the left path.\n\nNow, back to the right path: if at t7 I go R to (5,5), then I can reach (6,4) or (6,6) quickly.\n\n(6,4) at (6,4), from (5,5) I can go to (6,5) then (6,4), or (5,4) then (6,4).\n\n(6,4) life span 4 at t7, so at t9 it will be life span 2, still there.\n\nSimilarly, (6,6) life span 7, no problem.\n\nAlso, after eating, I need to survive.\n\nBut there is a danger: \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nBut in this case, when I eat food, the tail doesn't move, so the snake grows, and the new tail is the old tail, but when I move to a food cell, I eat it, so the tail doesn't move that turn, so the segment before tail becomes new tail or something.\n\nStandard snake: when you eat, you grow, so the tail stays, and a new segment is added at head.\n\nSo positions: after eating, head moves to food cell, and body extends, so tail remains.\n\nThen next move, tail moves only if no food eaten.\n\nIn terms of collision, when I move to a food cell, if that cell was adjacent to the tail, and I eat, then the head is now on that cell, and the tail is still there, but since I grow, the tail doesn't move, so head and tail are on different cells unless they were the same, but usually not adjacent except in small snake.\n\nThe danger is: if the head is adjacent to the tail, and the tail cell has food, but the food is on the tail cell, not on head cell.\n\n\"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because after eating, the head moves to food cell, and since you grow, the tail doesn't move, but the food was on tail cell, so when you eat it, the head moves to where the food was, which is the tail cell, so head and tail are on same cell, collision immediately.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo if the head is adjacent to the tail, and the tail cell has food, and I move to that cell to eat, then head moves to tail cell, but tail is still there, so they occupy same cell, collision.\n\nTherefore, I should not eat food that is on the tail cell if the head is adjacent to tail.\n\nIn this state, snake positions: head (4,5), body (3,5), tail (3,4)\n\nTail is at (3,4), and head at (4,5), are they adjacent? (4,5) and (3,4): difference in x and y, not adjacent horizontally or vertically; diagonal, so not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing side, so up/down/left/right.\n\n(4,5) and (3,5) are adjacent horizontally, but (3,5) is body, not tail.\n\nTail is (3,4), which is down from head? (4,5) to (3,4) is diagonal, not adjacent. So not adjacent.\n\nSimilarly, the cells adjacent to tail (3,4) are (3,3), (3,5), (2,4), (4,4) but (4,4) obstacle, (3,5) is body, (2,4) obstacle, (3,3) might be free.\n\nBut food is not on tail cell; tail cell is (3,4), no food there.\n\nFood at (2,2), (6,4), etc., not on tail.\n\nSo no immediate danger.\n\nNow, for long-term, I should aim to eat (6,4) or (6,6) since they are closer and can be eaten soon if I go right.\n\n(1,5) is also close but blocked left, so I need to go around.\n\nLet's compare the paths.\n\nFirst, if I go U at t7: to (4,6)\n\nThen t8: must go L to (3,6) (only choice)\n\nThen t9: from (3,6), I can go D to (3,5) or L to (2,6)\n\nIf go D to (3,5): then at (3,5), no food, snake [(3,5), (3,6), (4,6)]\n\nThen t10: from (3,5), direction D (since moved D to (3,5)? After moving to (3,5) from (3,6), direction is D, so at t10, cannot U, so can L, R, D.\n\nL to (2,5), R to (4,5), D to (3,4)\n\n(4,5) might be free, but let's see.\n\nPositions: at t9, snake [(3,5), (3,6), (4,6)]\n\nt10 move L to (2,5): head (2,5), body (3,5), (3,6), and (4,6) removed? No food at (2,5)? (2,5) not food, so snake [(2,5), (3,5), (3,6)]\n\nThen from (2,5), I can go to (1,5) at t11 if move L.\n\n(1,5) has food, so at t11 move L to (1,5), eat, grow to length 4.\n\nBut life span of (1,5) is long, no issue.\n\nIf at t9 from (3,6) I go L to (2,6), then t9: head (2,6), snake [(2,6), (3,6), (4,6)]\n\nThen t10: from (2,6), direction L, so can U, D, L (cannot R).\n\nU to (2,7) wall invalid.\n\nD to (2,5): possible.\n\nL to (1,6): possible.\n\nThen to (2,5) then (1,5) at t11, same as above.\n\nBut (1,6) to (1,5) is down, but (1,5) is at y=5, so from (1,6) D to (1,5).\n\nEat at t11 or t12.\n\nNow, if at t7 I go R to (5,5)\n\nThen t8: I can go R to (6,5) or D to (5,4)\n\nSuppose t8 go R to (6,5): snake [(6,5), (5,5), (4,5)]\n\nDirection R.\n\nt9: from (6,5), can U to (6,6) or D to (6,4), both food.\n\nIf U to (6,6), eat, grow to [(6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5)]\n\nDirection U.\n\nThen from (6,6), I need to move, but U to (6,7) wall, invalid; D to (6,5) but (6,5) is body, collision; L to (5,6) but (5,6) obstacle; R to (7,6) wall invalid. So from (6,6), after eating, I have no safe move! All directions blocked or invalid.\n\nU: (6,7) wall\n\nD: (6,5) is body segment, collision\n\nL: (5,6) obstacle\n\nR: (7,6) wall\n\nSo dead end, snake dies.\n\nIf at t9 I move D to (6,4) instead.\n\nFrom (6,5), move D to (6,4), eat food, grow to [(6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5)]\n\nDirection D.\n\nThen from (6,4), possible moves: U, D, L, R, but direction D, so cannot U (reverse).\n\nU to (6,5): (6,5) is body, collision.\n\nD to (6,3): but (6,3) is obstacle! Internal obstacle at (6,3), so cannot.\n\nL to (5,4): (5,4) should be free? At this point, positions: after move, body is (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), so (5,4) not occupied, and not obstacle, so can move L to (5,4).\n\nR to (7,4) wall invalid.\n\nSo only possible move L to (5,4).\n\nThen at t10, move L to (5,4), no food, snake becomes [(5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5)]? After eating at (6,4), positions [(6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5)]\n\nMove to (5,4), new head (5,4), body (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), and (4,5) removed? No food at (5,4), so tail removed, snake [(5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5)]? Segments: head to (5,4), then previous head (6,4) becomes body, then (6,5), (5,5), and (4,5) is tail, removed. So positions [(5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5)]\n\nBut (5,5) is now the tail? List: index 0: head (5,4), 1: (6,4), 2: (6,5), 3: tail (5,5)\n\n(5,5) and (5,4) are adjacent vertically? (5,4) and (5,5) differ in y, so if I move from (5,4), etc.\n\nBut snake is alive.\n\nThen I can continue.\n\nBut at t9, if I eat (6,4), I have a safe move to (5,4).\n\nIf I eat (6,6), I was stuck.\n\nSo better to eat (6,4) at (6,4) from (6,5).\n\nNow, back to t8, if from (5,5) I move D to (5,4) at t8.\n\nThen at t8, head (5,4), no food, snake [(5,4), (5,5), (4,5)]\n\nDirection D.\n\nt9: from (5,4), can move D to (5,3) or R to (6,4) (since L to (4,4) obstacle, cannot U).\n\nIf R to (6,4), eat food, grow to [(6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5)]\n\nThen same as before, from (6,4) I can move L to (5,4) but (5,4) is now body? After growth, positions: head (6,4), body (5,4), (5,5), (4,5)\n\nSo (5,4) is body segment.\n\nFrom (6,4), move L to (5,4) would be collision with body.\n\nMove U to (6,5): (6,5) might be free, but not sure.\n\nAt t9 after move to (6,4), positions [(6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5)]\n\nNow, from (6,4), direction R (since moved from (5,4) to (6,4), direction R? From (5,4) to (6,4) is right, so direction R.\n\nAt t10, from (6,4), direction R, cannot move L (opposite).\n\nCan move U, D, R.\n\nU to (6,5): (6,5) should be free? Not occupied, not wall, not obstacle, so possible.\n\nD to (6,3): obstacle, invalid.\n\nR to (7,4): wall, invalid.\n\nSo only possible move U to (6,5).\n\nThen to (6,5), no food, snake [(6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5)] and (4,5) removed? After move, head to (6,5), body (6,4), (5,4), (5,5), tail (4,5) removed.\n\nPositions: [(6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5)]\n\n(5,5) is tail? Head (6,5), then (6,4), (5,4), tail (5,5)\n\nNow, (5,5) and (6,5) are adjacent, but not issue unless moving into it.\n\nThen I can move from there.\n\nBut in this case, I ate (6,4) at t9.\n\nCompared to eating at t9 when coming from (6,5).\n\nNow, for the left path, eating (1,5) at t11 or so.\n\nBut (6,4) has shorter life span, but I can eat it by t9, while (1,5) later.\n\nAlso, score is same, +1 each.\n\nBut by eating sooner, I grow longer, which might help with survival or accessing other food.\n\nBut longer snake might be harder to maneuver.\n\nNow, another thing: at (1,5), when I approach, I need to ensure no tail reward danger, but tail might be elsewhere.\n\nBut for now, since (6,4) can be eaten soon, and it might disappear sooner relatively, but life span to t10, so eating at t9 is fine.\n\nSimilarly, (6,6) I can eat, but from (6,5) if I go U, I get stuck, so better not to go to (6,6) directly.\n\n(6,6) can be accessed later if I go around.\n\nBut for now, the right path seems better to get food quickly.\n\nMoreover, in the left path, after going to (4,6), I have only one choice to (3,6), then to (3,5) or (2,6), which might lead to dead ends or limited space.\n\nFor example, from (3,5), I can go to (2,5), but (2,4) is obstacle, so from (2,5), possible moves: U to (2,6), D to (2,4) obstacle invalid, L to (1,5), R to (3,5) body or not.\n\nSimilarly, constrained.\n\nWhereas on the right, more open space.\n\nAlso, food (6,6) is there, which I can eat later.\n\nBut let's think 5 turns ahead.\n\nCurrent turn t7.\n\nI need to output actions for t7, t8, t9, t10, t11, etc., but perhaps 5 turns.\n\nSince state changes, I should decide the first move and think ahead.\n\nBut for answer, I need to output a sequence.\n\nPerhaps I can plan a path.\n\nSince (2,2) is not reachable, and (1,5) is reachable later, I should go for (6,4) now.\n\nAt t7, move R to (5,5)\n\nThen at t8, I can choose to go R to (6,5) or D to (5,4)\n\nIf I go R to (6,5), then at t9 I can eat (6,4) by moving D.\n\nIf I go D to (5,4), then at t9 I can eat (6,4) by moving R.\n\nEither way, I can eat (6,4) at t9.\n\nBut if I go to (6,5) first, then to (6,4), I have a safe exit to (5,4) after eating.\n\nIf I go to (5,4) first, then to (6,4), I can go to (6,5) after.\n\nBut similar.\n\nGoing to (6,5) first might be better because from (6,5) I have choice to eat (6,4) or (6,6), but (6,6) is dangerous to eat, as we saw.\n\nSo better to eat (6,4).\n\nSo plan: t7: R to (5,5)\n\nt8: R to (6,5)  // to set up for (6,4)\n\nt9: D to (6,4)  // eat food\n\nThen at t9, after eating, snake at [(6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5)] direction D\n\nt10: from (6,4), direction D, cannot U. Possible moves: L to (5,4), D to (6,3) obstacle invalid, R invalid, U invalid? Direction D, so cannot U, but U is to (6,5), which is body.\n\nCan move L to (5,4) or, only L? D and R invalid, U invalid because reverse or body.\n\nU: (6,5) is body, collision.\n\nD: (6,3) obstacle.\n\nR: (7,4) wall.\n\nSo only L to (5,4)\n\n(5,4) should be free; at t9, positions: head (6,4), body (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), so (5,4) not occupied.\n\nNot obstacle, so move L to (5,4)\n\nThen at t10, move to (5,4), no food, snake becomes [(5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5)] and (4,5) removed? After move, new head (5,4), body (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), tail (4,5) removed. So [(5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5)]\n\nDirection L (since moved left from (6,4))\n\nt11: from (5,4), direction L, cannot R. Possible moves: U, D, L.\n\nU to (5,5): but (5,5) is body segment, collision.\n\nD to (5,3): (5,3) should be free? Not wall, not obstacle (obstacle at (6,3), not (5,3)), so possible.\n\nL to (4,4): but (4,4) obstacle, invalid.\n\nSo only D to (5,3)\n\nThen move to (5,3), no food, snake [(5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5)] and (5,5) removed? Positions: head (5,3), body (5,4), (6,4), tail (6,5)? List: after move, head (5,3), then (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), and (5,5) was removed.\n\n(5,5) was the tail before, removed.\n\nThen I can continue, but no immediate food.\n\nI have (6,6) food, which I can reach later.\n\nFrom (5,3), I can go to (5,2) or (4,3), etc., but (6,6) is up.\n\nBut obstacles, might be tricky.\n\nIf at t8 from (5,5) I move D to (5,4) instead.\n\nt7: R to (5,5)\n\nt8: D to (5,4)  // no food\n\nThen t9: R to (6,4)  // eat food\n\nThen snake grows: [(6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5)] direction R\n\nt10: from (6,4), direction R, cannot L. Possible: U, D, R.\n\nU to (6,5): (6,5) should be free? At this point, positions: head (6,4), body (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), so (6,5) free.\n\nMove U to (6,5)\n\nThen snake [(6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5)] and (4,5) removed.\n\nDirection U.\n\nThen t11: from (6,5), direction U, cannot D. Possible: L, R, U.\n\nU to (6,6): eat (6,6) food? (6,6) has food, so move U to (6,6), eat, grow to length 5: [(6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5)]\n\nBut now from (6,6), as before, no safe moves: U wall, D to (6,5) body, L obstacle, R wall. Stuck, dead.\n\nIf at t11 from (6,5) I don't go U, but L or R.\n\nR to (7,5) wall invalid.\n\nL to (5,5) but (5,5) is body, collision.\n\nSo only U or, but U is to (6,6) which has food, but after eating I die.\n\nIf I don't go to (6,6), from (6,5) I have no other moves? U to (6,6) or, but if I don't move U, but must move.\n\nAt t11, from (6,5), only possible moves: U to (6,6) or, but L and R invalid as above, so only U to (6,6), then die.\n\nSo this path leads to death if I eat (6,6) later.\n\nTherefore, it's better not to be in a position where I have to eat (6,6) when surrounded.\n\nIn the first subpath, when I ate (6,4) from (6,5), I went to (5,4) and down, avoiding (6,6) for now.\n\n(6,6) can be eaten later if I approach from a different angle.\n\nFor example, from below or left.\n\nBut with obstacles, hard.\n\nSince (6,6) has long life, I can leave it for later.\n\nNow, for the left food (1,5), it has long life, so I can go for it after.\n\nBut in the right path, I can eat (6,4) quickly.\n\nCompared to going left, I eat later at t11 or so.\n\nBut by eating sooner, I have a longer snake, which might be useful, or might not.\n\nBut since all food is +1, eating one sooner is better for score, but I need to survive to eat more.\n\nIn the left path, I might eat (1,5) at t11, but with smaller snake.\n\nIn right path, I eat at t9.\n\nBut in right path after eating, I go to (5,4) and down, no food, so I need to find other food.\n\n(6,6) is there, but dangerous to eat now.\n\nI could go towards (1,5) from the right, but it's far.\n\nAnother food is (2,2), but unreachable.\n\nSo perhaps after eating (6,4), I can head towards (1,5).\n\nFor example, from t10 position after eating (6,4) and moving to (5,4), snake at [(5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5)] or something.\n\nIn the first sequence: after t9 eat (6,4), t10 move L to (5,4), snake [(5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5)] with (5,5) tail.\n\nThen t11 move D to (5,3), snake [(5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5)] tail (5,5) removed? After move to (5,3), head (5,3), body (5,4), (6,4), tail (6,5)\n\nThen from (5,3), I can go L to (4,3), D to (5,2), etc., towards left-bottom.\n\nBut (1,5) is at top-left, y=5.\n\nFrom (5,3), to (1,5), need to go up and left.\n\nBut obstacles at (2,4), (1,4), etc.\n\nMight be possible but takes time.\n\nIf I go left at t7, I can reach (1,5) by t11 with snake length 3 or 4.\n\nBut let's estimate.\n\nAt t7 move U to (4,6)\n\nt8 move L to (3,6)\n\nt9 move D to (3,5)  // assume\n\nt10 move L to (2,5)  // to (2,5)\n\nt11 move L to (1,5)  // eat at (1,5)\n\nAt t11, eat (1,5), grow to length 4.\n\nFrom start, at t7, length 3, after eating at t11, length 4.\n\nIn right path, eat at t9, so at t9 length 4, then no more food eaten soon, so length stays 4.\n\nIn left path, at t11 length 4.\n\nBut in right path, I ate at t9, so I have the score earlier, but same number.\n\nBut in left path, I might be able to eat other food later, but (2,2) gone, (6,4) might be gone by t11 if not eaten.\n\n(6,4) disappears after turn 10, so at t11 it is gone.\n\nSimilarly, (6,6) is there.\n\nBut with snake longer, harder to move.\n\nPerhaps it's better to eat (6,4) now since it will disappear soon.\n\n(6,4) life span 4 at t7, so at t10 it is last turn, disappear before t11.\n\nSo to eat it, I must be on it at t10 or before.\n\nAt t9 I can eat it.\n\nIn the left path, I cannot reach it by t9 or t10.\n\nSo if I go left, I miss (6,4).\n\nWhereas (1,5) can be eaten later.\n\nSo for score, eating (6,4) gives +1 now, and I can try for (1,5) later or (6,6).\n\n(6,6) is harder to eat safely.\n\nSo I think going right to eat (6,4) is better.\n\nThus at t7, move R to (5,5)\n\nThen t8, I can move R to (6,5) to set up for (6,4)\n\nt9 move D to (6,4) to eat\n\nThen t10 move L to (5,4)\n\nThen from there, I can plan to go towards (1,5) or other.\n\nBut for answer, I need to output actions for several turns.\n\nSince the state changes, I should output the sequence based on current knowledge.\n\nBut food life span decreases, so I need to simulate.\n\nPerhaps output 5 turns: t7 to t11.\n\nIn the sequence above: t7: R, t8: R, t9: D, t10: L (to (5,4))\n\nThen at t10, after move to (5,4), as above, positions [(5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5)] direction L\n\nt11: from (5,4), direction L, cannot R. Possible moves: U, D, L.\n\nU to (5,5): but (5,5) is body, collision.\n\nD to (5,3): possible, as before.\n\nL to (4,4): obstacle, invalid.\n\nSo only D to (5,3)\n\nThus t11: D\n\nThen snake to (5,3), and so on.\n\nBut I don't have food positions beyond, so I can stop here.\n\nTo maximize, after t10, I can go left towards (1,5), but it will take time.\n\nFor the answer, I'll output the actions.\n\nBut in the left option, if I go U at t7, I might not get food soon.\n\nSo I think R is better.\n\nTherefore, for turn 7: R\n\nThen for subsequent turns.\n\nIn the sequence, at t8, if I move D to (5,4), I can still eat at t9 by moving R to (6,4), and then at t10 move U to (6,5), but as before, then at t11 I might be forced to eat (6,6) and die.\n\nWhereas if I go to (6,5) first at t8, I can eat (6,4) and move away safely.\n\nSo the sequence with t8 R to (6,5) is safer.\n\nThus:\n\nTurn 7: R (right)\n\nTurn 8: R (to (6,5))\n\nTurn 9: D (down to (6,4), eat)\n\nThen turn 10: L (left to (5,4))\n\nThen turn 11: D (down to (5,3))\n\nNow, for turn 12, I could go left, but not necessary to output.\n\nSince the answer format might expect a sequence, I'll do 5 turns: t7 to t11.\n\nBut t11 is the 5th action? t7, t8, t9, t10, t11: that's 5 actions.\n\nt7: action for turn 7, etc.\n\nNow, to write in boxed.\n\nBut in the sequence, at turn 9, I eat, good.\n\nNow, I should confirm if at (6,4) there is food, yes.\n\nAnd no tail danger.\n\nSimilarly, all moves safe.\n\nIf I had gone left, I might not eat until later and miss (6,4).\n\nSo I think this is better.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score and ensure long-term survival, I analyzed the current state and planned 5 turns ahead (turns 7 to 11). The key considerations are:\n\n- **Food Prioritization**: The food at (6,4) has a life span of 4 (disappears after turn 10), making it urgent to eat soon. The food at (1,5) has a long life span (10 turns) and can be targeted later. The food at (2,2) is unreachable before it disappears (life span 3, gone after turn 9), and (6,6) is risky to eat due to potential trapping.\n- **Movement Safety**: Avoid walls, obstacles, and body collisions. The snake head direction is right at turn 7, so left (reverse) is invalid. After eating, ensure escape routes exist (e.g., eating (6,4) is safe only if followed by moving left to (5,4)).\n- **Path Selection**: Moving right at turn 7 allows quick access to (6,4) by turn 9. Moving up at turn 7 leads to dead ends and misses (6,4). After eating (6,4), the path moves down to (5,3) to avoid the dangerous (6,6) area and position for future food like (1,5).\n\n**Planned Sequence (turns 7-11):**\n- **Turn 7 (t=7)**: Move right (R) to (5,5). This avoids the up move, which forces a dead-end path, and positions the snake toward (6,4).\n- **Turn 8 (t=8)**: Move right (R) to (6,5). This sets up to eat (6,4) next turn. Down to (5,4) is possible but delays eating and risks being forced toward (6,6).\n- **Turn 9 (t=9)**: Move down (D) to (6,4) to eat the food (+1 score, length increases to 4). Life span of (6,4) is 4 at turn 7, so it is still present (countdown: turn 7=4, turn 8=3, turn 9=2). No tail reward danger (head not adjacent to tail).\n- **Turn 10 (t=10)**: Move left (L) to (5,4). After eating, this is the only safe move (up to (6,5) causes collision, down to (6,3) is obstacle, right is wall). No food at (5,4), so tail moves.\n- **Turn 11 (t=11)**: Move down (D) to (5,3). From (5,4), up to (5,5) causes collision, left to (4,4) is obstacle, so down is the only safe move. This positions the snake to later navigate toward (1,5) or other areas.\n\n**Simulated Snake Positions (for verification):**\n- Turn 7 start: Snake = [(4,5), (3,5), (3,4)], head dir = R\n- Turn 7 (R): Move to (5,5). Snake = [(5,5), (4,5), (3,5)], head dir = R (tail (3,4) removed)\n- Turn 8 (R): Move to (6,5). Snake = [(6,5), (5,5), (4,5)], head dir = R\n- Turn 9 (D): Move to (6,4), eat food. Snake = [(6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5)] (length +1), head dir = D\n- Turn 10 (L): Move to (5,4). Snake = [(5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5)], head dir = L (tail (4,5) removed)\n- Turn 11 (D): Move to (5,3). Snake = [(5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5)], head dir = D (tail (5,5) removed)\n\nThis sequence eats one food safely by turn 9, avoids all risks, and keeps the snake alive for future opportunities. Beyond turn 11, the snake can target (1,5) by moving left/down or consider (6,6) with caution.\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn } 7\\text{: R} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 8\\text{: R} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 9\\text{: D} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 10\\text{: L} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 11\\text{: D}\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I'm playing Snake on a 2D grid. The grid has walls and obstacles. From the state, the borders are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid since coordinates go from 0 to 7 inclusive. There are also internal obstacles at (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), and (6,3).\n\nSnake positions: head at (5,5), then (4,5), (3,5). So the snake is horizontal, moving right, since head direction is R. Current length is 3 segments.\n\nFood items:\n\n- (2,2) with life span 2 and value +1 (positive food)\n\n- (6,4) with life span 3 and value +1\n\n- (6,6) with life span 6 and value +1\n\n- (1,5) with life span 9 and value +1\n\nAll food is positive; no negative food mentioned. Value is +1 for all, and life span decreases each turn.\n\nCurrent turn is t1 = 8.\n\nI need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks. Prioritize long-term survival.\n\nFirst, let's map the grid for clarity. I'll sketch an 8x8 grid.\n\nRows y from 0 to 7, columns x from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are all walls. So any move to x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 is death.\n\nInternal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3). These are also deadly to move into.\n\nSnake: head at (5,5), body at (4,5), tail at (3,5). So positions: (5,5), (4,5), (3,5). All at y=5, x from 3 to 5.\n\nHead direction is R, so last move was right, meaning from (4,5) to (5,5). So I cannot move left instantly, because that would be reverse to current direction.\n\nPossible moves from (5,5): Up, Down, Left, Right? But left is opposite to current direction R, so cannot move left. Also, need to check walls and obstacles.\n\nCurrent position: (5,5)\n\n- Up: (5,6) – is this safe? (5,6) is an internal obstacle! (5,6) is listed as an obstacle, so moving up to (5,6) is death.\n\n- Down: (5,4) – y=4, x=5. Is this a wall or obstacle? Borders are y=0 and y=7, so y=4 is fine. Obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3). (5,4) is not listed, so it should be empty. But let's confirm: obstacles are (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3). (5,4) is not there, so it's free.\n\n- Left: (4,5) – but this is the body segment. Moving left to (4,5) would be moving into the body. But (4,5) is the segment right behind the head. Since the snake will move, when head moves, the body follows, so moving to (4,5) would cause the head to collide with the body segment that is about to move? Let's think carefully.\n\nRule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nIn this case, (4,5) is not the tail; the tail is at (3,5). Positions: head (5,5), then (4,5), then tail (3,5). So (4,5) is the first body segment.\n\nIf I move left to (4,5), that cell is currently occupied by the body. After the move, the head would be at (4,5), and since the body moves, the segment that was at (4,5) moves to where? Let's simulate.\n\nBefore move: head (5,5), segment1 (4,5), segment2 (3,5)\n\nIf head moves left to (4,5):\n\n- New head position: (4,5)\n\nBut (4,5) was occupied by segment1. After head moves, segment1 must move to the previous head position? No.\n\nStandard snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment in front of it.\n\nSo, if head moves to (4,5), which is where segment1 was, then:\n\n- Head is now at (4,5)\n\n- Segment1 (which was at (4,5)) needs to move to where? It should move to the next position. But the position it was at is now occupied by head, so segment1 moves to (5,5)? That doesn't make sense.\n\nI think I'm confusing myself.\n\nBetter to think: the snake moves one cell in the direction, so the head goes to the new position, and each body segment shifts to the position of the segment ahead of it.\n\nSo, current positions:\n\n- Head: (5,5)\n\n- Body: (4,5)  // segment 1\n\n- Tail: (3,5)   // segment 2\n\nIf head moves left to (4,5):\n\n- New head: (4,5)\n\n- Then body segment 1 (was at (4,5)) moves to where the head was, (5,5)? No.\n\nThe new position for segment1 is the old position of the head, which is (5,5).\n\nBut (5,5) is now empty because head moved.\n\nSo:\n\n- Head moves to (4,5)\n\n- Segment1 moves to (5,5)  // old head position\n\n- Segment2 (tail) moves to (4,5)  // old position of segment1? No.\n\nAfter head moves, the body segments follow: segment1 moves to the previous position of the head, which is (5,5).\n\nThen segment2 moves to the previous position of segment1, which was (4,5), but (4,5) is now the new head position? This is messy.\n\nStandard way: when the head moves, it occupies a new cell. Then, the first body segment moves to the cell where the head was, and so on, down to the tail.\n\nSo in this case:\n\n- Head moves to new position, say (4,5)\n\n- But (4,5) was occupied by segment1. So after head moves to (4,5), segment1 is still there? Collision.\n\nAh, yes: moving to a cell occupied by a body segment causes collision, except for the tail if it's about to move.\n\nThe rule says: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nBut here, (4,5) is not the tail; it's the segment behind the head. The tail is at (3,5).\n\nSo moving to (4,5) would be head colliding with a body segment, which is deadly.\n\nSimilarly, moving to any body segment except the tail is deadly.\n\nIn this case, possible moves:\n\n- Up: (5,6) – but (5,6) is an obstacle, so death.\n\n- Down: (5,4) – empty? Let's check: y=4, x=5. Not a border, not in obstacles: obstacles are (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3). (5,4) is not listed, so should be free.\n\n- Left: (4,5) – this is occupied by body segment, not tail, so collision.\n\n- Right: (6,5) – x=6, y=5. Borders x=0 and x=7, so x=6<7, ok. Obstacles: (6,3) is at y=3, so (6,5) should be free.\n\nNow, what about (6,5)? Is it occupied? Snake is at (5,5),(4,5),(3,5), so (6,5) is empty.\n\nFood at (6,4), (6,6), etc., but (6,5) no food mentioned, so empty.\n\nSo possible moves: Down to (5,4) or Right to (6,5). Up is blocked by obstacle, left is blocked by body.\n\nCannot move up or left.\n\nSo choices: D or R.\n\nNow, I need to think ahead multiple turns.\n\nAlso, food life spans: current turn t1=8.\n\nFood:\n\n- (2,2): life span 2, so disappears after 2 turns? Life span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn t=8, life span=2, meaning it will disappear after turn 9? Let's clarify.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n\nSo for (2,2): life span 2 at turn 8. After turn 8, life span becomes 1 (if not eaten). After turn 9, life span becomes 0, and it disappears. So it can be eaten on turn 8 or 9, but not after.\n\nSimilarly, (6,4): life span 3 at turn 8, so disappears after turn 10? After turn 8, span=2; turn 9, span=1; turn 10, span=0 and disappear. So available until turn 10.\n\nTurn numbers: let's say after each move, turn increases.\n\nCurrent turn is 8, we choose action for turn 8, then after that, turn 9, and so on.\n\nFood life span decreases after each turn, including after the action is taken? The rule says \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", but current turn is before action?\n\nI think it's better to think: at the start of turn, life span is as given. After the turn, when we move, life span decreases.\n\nBut the rule: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nPerhaps at the end of the turn, after the move, life span decreases.\n\nTo be precise: for a food with life span L at turn t, if not eaten during turn t, after turn t, life span becomes L-1, and so on, until 0, when it disappears.\n\nSo for (2,2) at turn 8: life span 2, so if not eaten on turn 8, after turn 8, span=1; if not eaten on turn 9, after turn 9, span=0 and disappear.\n\nSimilarly, (6,4): span=3 at turn 8, so available turns 8,9,10; disappear after turn 10.\n\n(6,6): span=6, available turns 8 to 13.\n\n(1,5): span=9, available turns 8 to 16.\n\nNow, back to moves.\n\nFrom (5,5), I can move Down to (5,4) or Right to (6,5).\n\nI need to evaluate both options with future considerations.\n\nFirst, let's list all possible moves for the next few turns.\n\nAlso, the snake is small, only length 3, so growing is good, but avoid risks.\n\nNow, special rule: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because head and newly grown tail collide.\n\nBut in this case, tail is at (3,5), and head is at (5,5), not adjacent; they are two cells apart. Adjacent means next to, so (4,5) is between them, so head not adjacent to tail.\n\nNow, let's consider moving Down to (5,4).\n\nAfter move Down: head to (5,4), body: segment1 moves to old head (5,5), segment2 (tail) moves to old segment1 position (4,5). So new positions: head (5,4), body (5,5), tail (4,5).\n\nHead direction now D (down).\n\nNow, from here, possible moves: U, D, L, R, but cannot reverse, so since head moved down, cannot move up instantly.\n\nReverse to current direction: current direction after move is down, so cannot move up.\n\nPossible moves from (5,4):\n\n- Up: (5,5) – but that's occupied by body segment. (5,5) is now the body segment, not tail. Tail is at (4,5). So moving to (5,5) would be collision with body.\n\n- Down: (5,3) – y=3, x=5. Borders y=0 and y=7, y=3>0. Obstacles: (6,3) is an obstacle, but (5,3) not listed, so should be free. Check: obstacles (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3). (5,3) not there, so free.\n\n- Left: (4,4) – (4,4) is an internal obstacle! Yes, (4,4) is in the list, so moving left to (4,4) is death.\n\n- Right: (6,4) – (6,4) has food! And it's not a wall or obstacle. (6,4) is a food position, value +1.\n\nIs (6,4) occupied? Currently, snake is at (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), so (6,4) is empty.\n\nBut moving right to (6,4) would eat the food, since head moves there.\n\nNow, if I eat food, snake grows, so after eating, new tail added, so positions: head at (6,4), then the body segments: segment1 at (5,4), segment2 at (5,5), and new tail? When eating, the tail doesn't move, so the snake grows by one.\n\nStandard: when head eats food, it moves to the food cell, and a new segment is added at the tail position, so the tail doesn't move.\n\nIn this case, before move: positions (5,4), (5,5), (4,5)\n\nHead moves to (6,4) and eats food there. Since food is eaten, snake grows, so new positions: head at (6,4), then segment1 at (5,4), segment2 at (5,5), and new segment at (4,5), so tail at (4,5) or (5,5)? Let's list:\n\n- Head moves to (6,4)\n\n- Body segments: since food eaten, the tail stays, so segment1 moves to old head (5,4), segment2 moves to old segment1 position (5,5)? No.\n\nAfter head moves and eats food, the new head is at food cell, and the body segments shift, but since food eaten, the tail doesn't move, so a new segment is added at the end.\n\nSo: head at (6,4)\n\nThen the previous head position is now the first body segment: so (5,4) becomes body segment 1\n\nThen (5,5) was body segment 1, now becomes body segment 2\n\nThen (4,5) was tail, now since growth, it remains and a new segment is added? No: the tail position stays, and a new segment is added after the tail.\n\nTypically, the tail doesn't move when growing.\n\nSo positions after eating:\n\n- Head: (6,4)\n\n- Body segment 1: (5,4)  // previous head\n\n- Body segment 2: (5,5)  // previous segment1\n\n- Tail: (4,5)  // previous tail, no change, but since grown, it's now body segment, and new tail added? I think I have it.\n\nStandard: snake length increases by one, so after eating, the tail remains where it was, and the new position is added at the head.\n\nBefore move: positions: A (head), B, C (tail)\n\nAfter move without eating: head to new, B to A, C to B, so tail moves to B.\n\nAfter move with eating: head to new, B to A, C stays, so new tail is C, and length increases.\n\nIn this case:\n\nBefore move: head (5,4), body (5,5), tail (4,5)\n\nMove head to (6,4) and eat.\n\nNew: head (6,4)\n\nBody: (5,4)  // old head\n\nTail: (5,5)  // old body, but since ate, tail stays? Old tail was (4,5), it doesn't move.\n\nSo positions: head (6,4), body segment 1 (5,4), body segment 2 (5,5), tail (4,5)  // (4,5) is still there.\n\nSo snake now at (6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5)\n\nLength 4.\n\nNow, back to possible moves from (5,4) after moving down.\n\nFrom (5,4), I can:\n\n- Up: (5,5) - occupied by body, collision\n\n- Down: (5,3) - free\n\n- Left: (4,4) - obstacle, death\n\n- Right: (6,4) - food, eat and grow\n\nSo only Down or Right are possible from (5,4) if I go there.\n\nRight leads to eating food immediately.\n\nBut I need to think long-term.\n\nFirst, let's consider the other initial move: Right to (6,5)\n\nFrom (5,5), move Right to (6,5)\n\n(6,5) is empty, no food, so no eat.\n\nNew positions: head (6,5), body (5,5), tail (4,5)\n\nHead direction now R (right).\n\nNow from (6,5), possible moves:\n\nCannot reverse, so since moved right, cannot move left.\n\n- Up: (6,6) - (6,6) has food! And life span 6.\n\nIs (6,6) safe? Not wall or obstacle. Borders y=7, y=6<7. Obstacles: (6,3) at y=3, so (6,6) free.\n\n- Down: (6,4) - (6,4) has food! Also free.\n\n- Left: (5,5) - occupied by body, collision (since body at (5,5))\n\n- Right: (7,5) - x=7 is border wall, death.\n\nSo possible moves: Up to (6,6) or Down to (6,4), both have food.\n\nIf move Up to (6,6), eat food, grow.\n\nIf move Down to (6,4), eat food, grow.\n\nNow, I need to plan multiple turns.\n\nAlso, there is food at (2,2) with short life span, only until turn 9, so I might want to go there if possible.\n\n(2,2) is far, at turn 8, life span 2, so I can eat it on turn 9 at latest.\n\nFrom current position (5,5), to (2,2), it's distance |5-2| + |5-2| = 3+3=6 cells, so minimum 6 moves, but I can't go directly in 6 moves because of obstacles and snake body.\n\nFor example, to go to (2,2) from (5,5), I need to go left and down.\n\nBut directly left is blocked by body, so I have to go down or right first.\n\nIf I go down to (5,4), then from there, I can go down to (5,3), but (5,3) might be free, then to (5,2), but (5,2) to (2,2) left, but there might be obstacles.\n\nObstacles at (2,4), (4,4), etc.\n\nLet's map the grid with obstacles.\n\nGrid 8x8, x 0 to 7, y 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.\n\nInternal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3)\n\nSnake: (5,5), (4,5), (3,5)\n\nFood: (2,2), (6,4), (6,6), (1,5)\n\n(1,5) is at x=1,y=5, which is near the snake's tail.\n\nCurrent tail at (3,5), so (1,5) is left of that.\n\nBut (1,5) has life span 9, plenty of time.\n\n(2,2) is urgent.\n\nNow, from current, if I move right to (6,5), then I can eat (6,6) or (6,4) on the next turn.\n\nBut (6,4) has life span 3, so I can eat it later, but since I'm there, I might eat it.\n\nSimilarly, (6,6) has long life.\n\nBut if I eat one, I grow, which might help with survival, but also makes the snake longer, harder to maneuver.\n\nCurrently length 3, so growing is good for score.\n\nBut I need to avoid dead ends.\n\nAlso, after eating, the tail stays, which might block paths.\n\nLet's simulate both initial options.\n\nFirst option: move Down at turn 8 to (5,4)\n\nThen from (5,4), I can move Right to (6,4) to eat food, or Down to (5,3).\n\nIf I move Right to (6,4), I eat food, grow to length 4, positions: head (6,4), body (5,4), (5,5), tail (4,5)\n\nHead direction now R (right) or D? Moved from (5,4) to (6,4), so direction right.\n\nThen from (6,4), possible moves:\n\nCannot reverse left, since just moved right.\n\n- Up: (6,5) - is this free? Currently, after move, positions: head (6,4), body (5,4), (5,5), tail (4,5). So (6,5) is empty? No food mentioned, obstacles: (6,3) is obstacle, but (6,5) not, so free.\n\n- Down: (6,3) - (6,3) is an obstacle! Death.\n\n- Left: (5,4) - occupied by body, collision.\n\n- Right: (7,4) - x=7 wall, death.\n\nSo only possible move is Up to (6,5).\n\n(6,5) is empty, no food.\n\nMove to (6,5): no eat, new positions: head (6,5), body (6,4), (5,4), tail (5,5)? Let's see: head moves to (6,5), body segment1 moves to old head (6,4), segment2 moves to old segment1 (5,4), tail moves to old segment2 (5,5)? Positions: after previous, head (6,4), seg1 (5,4), seg2 (5,5), tail (4,5)\n\nAfter head moves to (6,5) without eating: head (6,5), seg1 moves to (6,4), seg2 moves to (5,4), tail moves to (5,5)? Old seg2 was (5,5), so tail moves to (5,5), but (5,5) was seg2, now tail is at (5,5), and (4,5) is abandoned.\n\nNew positions: head (6,5), body (6,4), body (5,4), tail (5,5)\n\n(5,5) was body, now tail.\n\nNow head at (6,5), direction U? Moved up from (6,4) to (6,5), so direction up.\n\nThen from (6,5), possible moves:\n\nCannot reverse down.\n\n- Up: (6,6) - has food! Can eat.\n\n- Down: (6,4) - occupied by body, collision.\n\n- Left: (5,5) - occupied by tail? Tail is at (5,5). Now, moving to tail: since it's the tail, and it will move, can I move there?\n\nRule: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo moving to (5,5) should be safe, because tail will move away.\n\n- Right: (7,5) - wall, death.\n\nSo possible moves: Up to (6,6) or Left to (5,5).\n\nIf move Up to (6,6), eat food, grow.\n\nIf move Left to (5,5), no eat, but safe.\n\n(6,6) has food, so I might eat it.\n\nBut let's see the other path.\n\nFrom (6,5), if I move Left to (5,5), which is tail.\n\nMove to (5,5): since it's tail, head moves to (5,5), tail was there, but tail moves forward? After move, head at (5,5), which was tail position.\n\nThen the body: seg1 at (6,5)? Current before move: head (6,5), body (6,4), body (5,4), tail (5,5)\n\nHead moves to (5,5), which is tail position.\n\nSince moving to tail, no collision.\n\nAfter move: head at (5,5), then seg1 moves to old head (6,5), seg2 moves to old seg1 (6,4), and tail moves to old seg2 (5,4)? Old seg2 was (5,4), so tail moves to (5,4).\n\nNew positions: head (5,5), body (6,5), body (6,4), tail (5,4)\n\nThen I can continue.\n\nBut this might not be efficient.\n\nBack to the decision.\n\nIf from (5,4) I had moved down to (5,3) instead of right.\n\nFrom (5,4), move down to (5,3).\n\n(5,3) free, no food.\n\nNew positions: head (5,3), body (5,4), tail (5,5)? Before: head (5,4), body (5,5), tail (4,5)\n\nAfter move down to (5,3): head (5,3), seg1 to (5,4), seg2 to (5,5), tail to (4,5)? Seg2 was (5,5), tail to (5,5), but (4,5) abandoned.\n\nPositions: head (5,3), body (5,4), body (5,5), tail (4,5) no: seg1 moves to old head (5,4), seg2 moves to old seg1 (5,5), tail moves to old seg2 (4,5)? Old seg2 was the tail at (4,5), so tail moves to (4,5), but since no eat, tail moves.\n\nNew positions: head (5,3), body (5,4), body (5,5), tail (4,5)\n\nHead direction down.\n\nThen from (5,3), possible moves:\n\nCannot reverse up.\n\n- Up: (5,4) - occupied by body, collision\n\n- Down: (5,2) - free? y=2, not border, not obstacle, obstacles include (6,3) but not (5,2), so free.\n\n- Left: (4,3) - free? x=4,y=3, not border, not in obstacles: (4,4) is obstacle, but (4,3) not, so free.\n\n- Right: (6,3) - obstacle, death.\n\nSo possible moves: Down to (5,2) or Left to (4,3).\n\n(5,2) has no food, (4,3) no food.\n\nThen I can go towards (2,2), for example.\n\nBut (2,2) life span 2, at turn 8, so must be eaten by turn 9.\n\nTurn 8: I move to (5,3) or from here.\n\nAt turn 8, I move from (5,5) to (5,4) or (6,5).\n\nIf I move to (5,4) at turn 8, then at turn 9, I need to move.\n\nTo reach (2,2) by turn 9, it's impossible from (5,4) in one move, since |5-2| + |4-2| = 3+2=5 cells, min 5 moves, but turn 9 is one move from turn 8 position.\n\nAfter turn 8 move, at start of turn 9, positions depend.\n\nIf at turn 8 I move to (5,4), then at turn 9, head at (5,4), to (2,2) is |5-2| + |4-2| = 3+2=5 cells away, cannot reach in one move. Similarly, from (6,5) to (2,2) |6-2| + |5-2| =4+3=7, farther.\n\nSo (2,2) cannot be eaten on turn 8 or 9 from current position; it must be eaten on turn 9 at latest, but from (5,5) at turn 8, after one move, I'm at (5,4) or (6,5), both more than 1 cell from (2,2), so I can't eat it on turn 9. Distance to (2,2) from (5,5) is |5-2| + |5-2| =6 cells, so min 6 moves. But life span 2 at turn 8, so after turn 8, if not eaten, span=1; after turn 9, if not eaten, span=0 and disappear. So it can only be eaten on turn 8 or turn 9.\n\nBut on turn 8, I'm at (5,5), (2,2) is not adjacent, so I can't eat it on turn 8.\n\nOn turn 9, wherever I am, I need to be at (2,2) to eat it.\n\nBut from turn 8 position, after move, at turn 9 start, I could be at (5,4) or (6,5), both at least distance 5 or 7 from (2,2), so I can't reach in one move. Therefore, it's impossible to eat (2,2); it will disappear after turn 9 without being eaten.\n\nSo I should ignore (2,2) and focus on other food.\n\n(2,2) is not reachable in time, so it will expire.\n\nNow, other food: (6,4) life span 3, so available turns 8,9,10; (6,6) span 6, available long; (1,5) span 9.\n\n(1,5) is at (1,5), which is near the snake's tail at (3,5), so I could go left to eat it.\n\nFor example, from current (5,5), if I could move left, but I can't because of body and no reverse.\n\nBut later, if I move, the tail moves, so (1,5) might be accessible.\n\nFor example, if I move down to (5,4), then tail moves to (4,5), so (3,5) is free, but (1,5) is still there.\n\nBut let's first decide the initial move.\n\nI have two choices: D to (5,4) or R to (6,5).\n\nIf I move R to (6,5) at turn 8, then at turn 9, I can move U to (6,6) or D to (6,4), both have food.\n\nEating either is good.\n\nSimilarly, if I move D to (5,4) at turn 8, then at turn 9, I can move R to (6,4) to eat or D to (5,3).\n\nMoving to (6,4) immediately might be good, but then I'm at (6,4), and only can move up to (6,5), then from there I can go to (6,6) or left.\n\nBut let's think about the grid with obstacles.\n\nThe area around (6,4) and (6,5) might be a bit constrained.\n\nFor example, from (6,4), only up to (6,5) is safe, then from (6,5), I can go up to (6,6) or left to (5,5).\n\nIf I go to (6,6), I eat another food, grow more.\n\nBut then I might be trapped.\n\nLet's list all cells around.\n\nPerhaps I should consider going towards (1,5) which is closer.\n\n(1,5) at (1,5), current head at (5,5), distance |5-1| + |5-5| =4, so min 4 moves.\n\nLife span 9, plenty of time.\n\nBut there are obstacles at (2,4) and (1,4), (4,4), which are below.\n\nTo go to (1,5) from (5,5), I need to go left, but currently blocked.\n\nAfter moving, the body moves, so paths open.\n\nFor example, if I move down to (5,4) at turn 8, then positions: head (5,4), body (5,5), tail (4,5)\n\nThen at turn 9, I can move down to (5,3) or right to (6,4).\n\nIf I move right to (6,4), eat food, grow to length 4, positions as before.\n\nThen at turn 10, from (6,4), only up to (6,5).\n\nMove to (6,5), no eat, positions: head (6,5), body (6,4), (5,4), tail (5,5)  // assuming tail at (5,5)\n\nThen at turn 11, from (6,5), I can move up to (6,6) to eat food or left to (5,5).\n\nIf I move up to (6,6), eat, grow to length 5, positions: head (6,6), body (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), tail (5,5)  // after eating, tail stays, so head (6,6), body (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), tail (5,5)\n\nNow from (6,6), possible moves:\n\nHead direction up.\n\nCannot reverse down.\n\n- Up: (6,7) - y=7 is border wall, death.\n\n- Down: (6,5) - occupied by body, collision.\n\n- Left: (5,6) - but (5,6) is obstacle! Death.\n\n- Right: (7,6) - x=7 wall, death.\n\nAll moves deadly! Trapped at (6,6) after eating.\n\nOh no! So if I go this path, after eating at (6,6), I have no safe moves, game over.\n\nTherefore, moving to (6,6) is dangerous because it's a corner with walls and obstacles.\n\nSpecifically, (6,6): up is wall, down is body or could be, left is obstacle, right is wall.\n\nSo indeed, dead end.\n\nTherefore, I should not go to (6,6) at all, or only if I have a way out.\n\nIn this case, from (6,5), if I move left to (5,5) instead of up.\n\nFrom (6,5), move left to (5,5), which is tail.\n\nHead moves to (5,5), which was tail, no collision.\n\nPositions before: head (6,5), body (6,4), body (5,4), tail (5,5)\n\nHead moves to (5,5): new head (5,5), seg1 to (6,5), seg2 to (6,4), tail to (5,4)? Old tail was (5,5), but head moves there, so seg1 moves to old head (6,5), seg2 moves to old seg1 (6,4), tail moves to old seg2 (5,4).\n\nNew positions: head (5,5), body (6,5), body (6,4), tail (5,4)\n\nNow head at (5,5), direction L (left).\n\nThen from here, I can move, for example, down or up, but left is reverse? Current direction left, so cannot move right.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- Up: (5,6) - obstacle, death\n\n- Down: (5,4) - occupied by tail? Tail is at (5,4). Moving to tail cell: since it's tail, can move there.\n\n- Left: (4,5) - free? (4,5) is empty now, no obstacle.\n\n- Right: (6,5) - occupied by body, collision, and cannot reverse anyway.\n\nSo possible: Down to (5,4) or Left to (4,5).\n\nIf move down to (5,4), which is tail, so safe.\n\nMove to (5,4): head to (5,4), tail was there, but tail moves to (5,4)? After move, head at (5,4), which was tail position.\n\nThen seg1 moves to old head (5,5), seg2 moves to old seg1 (6,5), tail moves to old seg2 (6,4).\n\nNew positions: head (5,4), body (5,5), body (6,5), tail (6,4)\n\nThen I can continue, but it's messy.\n\nFrom (5,5), move left to (4,5).\n\n(4,5) is free, no food.\n\nMove to (4,5): head (4,5), seg1 to (5,5), seg2 to (6,5), tail to (6,4)? Old tail at (5,4), so tail moves to (5,4)? Positions before move: head (5,5), body (6,5), body (6,4), tail (5,4)\n\nHead moves to (4,5): new head (4,5), seg1 to (5,5), seg2 to (6,5), tail to (6,4)\n\nNew positions: head (4,5), body (5,5), body (6,5), tail (6,4)\n\nHead direction left.\n\nThen from here, I can go towards (1,5) or other.\n\nBut let's go back to the initial choice.\n\nIf I move right to (6,5) at turn 8, then at turn 9, I can move down to (6,4) to eat, or up to (6,6).\n\nBut moving up to (6,6) is dangerous as we saw, so I should move down to (6,4).\n\nMove to (6,4) at turn 9, eat food, grow.\n\nPositions: before turn 9, head at (6,5), body (5,5), tail (4,5) for simplicity? After turn 8 move to (6,5), positions: head (6,5), body (5,5), tail (4,5)\n\nThen move down to (6,4): head to (6,4), eat food, so grow: head (6,4), body (6,5), body (5,5), tail (4,5)  // tail stays\n\nLength 4.\n\nHead direction down.\n\nThen from (6,4), at turn 10, possible moves:\n\nCannot reverse up.\n\n- Up: (6,5) - occupied by body, collision\n\n- Down: (6,3) - obstacle, death\n\n- Left: (5,4) - free? (5,4) not occupied, no obstacle.\n\n- Right: (7,4) - wall, death\n\nSo only left to (5,4).\n\nMove to (5,4), no food.\n\nPositions: head (5,4), body (6,4), body (6,5), tail (5,5)? Before: head (6,4), body (6,5), body (5,5), tail (4,5)\n\nHead moves to (5,4): new head (5,4), seg1 to (6,4), seg2 to (6,5), tail to (5,5)? Old tail at (4,5), so tail moves to (4,5)? Seg2 was (5,5), so tail moves to (5,5).\n\nNew positions: head (5,4), body (6,4), body (6,5), tail (5,5)\n\nHead direction L (left).\n\nThen from (5,4), turn 11, possible moves:\n\nCannot reverse right.\n\n- Up: (5,5) - occupied by tail? Tail at (5,5). Moving to tail cell, should be safe.\n\n- Down: (5,3) - free\n\n- Left: (4,4) - obstacle, death\n\n- Right: (6,4) - occupied by body, collision\n\nSo possible: Up to (5,5) or Down to (5,3).\n\nIf move up to (5,5), tail, safe.\n\nThen positions: head to (5,5), seg1 to (5,4), seg2 to (6,4), tail to (6,5)? Old tail at (5,5), head moves there, so seg1 to (5,4), but (5,4) was head, now body, seg2 to (6,4), tail to (6,5)\n\nNew: head (5,5), body (5,4), body (6,4), tail (6,5)\n\nThen from here, I can move, for example, left to (4,5) or down, but up is obstacle.\n\n(4,5) might be free.\n\nBut it's getting complicated.\n\nTo avoid the trap, from the beginning, moving right to (6,5) and then down to (6,4) is better than going to (6,6).\n\nBut after eating (6,4), I have to go left to (5,4), then I can go down to (5,3) or up to (5,5).\n\nNow, there is food at (1,5) I can target.\n\nAlso, the snake is longer, but I need to survive.\n\nAnother option: at turn 8, move down to (5,4), then at turn 9, instead of going right to (6,4), go down to (5,3) to avoid the corner.\n\nFrom (5,4) at turn 9, move down to (5,3).\n\nThen positions: head (5,3), body (5,4), body (5,5), tail (4,5)  // after move from (5,4) to (5,3), no eat, head (5,3), seg1 to (5,4), seg2 to (5,5), tail to (4,5)\n\nThen from (5,3), I can move down to (5,2) or left to (4,3), as earlier.\n\n(5,2) is free, then I can go to (4,2), (3,2), etc., towards (2,2) but it's gone, so to other areas.\n\nOr to (1,5).\n\n(1,5) is at y=5, x=1.\n\nFrom (5,3), I can go left to (4,3), then up to (4,4), but (4,4) is obstacle, so cannot.\n\nFrom (4,3), I can go up to (4,4) no, obstacle, or left to (3,3), etc.\n\nTo reach (1,5), I need to go up to y=5.\n\nFor example, from (5,3), go left to (4,3), then left to (3,3), then up to (3,4), but (3,4) is not obstacle? Obstacles: (2,4) is obstacle, but (3,4) not listed, so free.\n\nThen from (3,4) to (2,4) is obstacle, cannot, so to (3,5), then to (2,5), but (2,5) not obstacle, then to (1,5).\n\nBut (2,4) is obstacle, so I can go to (2,5) from (3,5).\n\nLet's plan a path to (1,5).\n\nFrom current, at turn 8, move down to (5,4).\n\nThen turn 9, move down to (5,3).\n\nThen turn 10, move left to (4,3).\n\nThen turn 11, move left to (3,3).\n\nThen turn 12, move up to (3,4).\n\nThen turn 13, move up to (3,5).\n\nBut (3,5) was the initial tail position, but now it might be free.\n\nThen from (3,5), move left to (2,5).\n\nThen to (1,5).\n\nBut (1,5) has food, and life span 9, so at turn 8, it can be eaten until turn 16, so plenty of time.\n\nTurn 13 to (3,5), turn 14 to (2,5), turn 15 to (1,5), eat.\n\nBut during this, I might eat other food or avoid risks.\n\nBut there is food at (6,4) and (6,6) that I might miss.\n\n(6,4) life span 3, so only available until turn 10.\n\nIf I go down and left, I won't eat it.\n\nSimilarly, (6,6) has longer life.\n\nBut (6,6) is dangerous to eat because of the trap.\n\nSo perhaps better to go for (1,5) which is safer.\n\nNow, the other initial move: at turn 8, move right to (6,5).\n\nThen at turn 9, move down to (6,4) to eat.\n\nThen at turn 10, move left to (5,4).\n\nThen from (5,4), at turn 11, I can move down to (5,3) or up to (5,5).\n\nIf I move down to (5,3), then I can go left to (4,3), etc., as above, to reach (1,5).\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut by eating (6,4), I have score +1, and longer snake.\n\nIf I go directly for (1,5) without eating (6,4), I miss that food.\n\nBut (6,4) might not be necessary.\n\nSince I need to maximize score, eating food is good, but survival first.\n\nAlso, the area around (1,5) might have fewer obstacles.\n\nLet's see the obstacles: at y=4, (1,4), (2,4), (4,4) are obstacles, so row y=4 has obstacles, but (1,5) is at y=5, which is clear except for the snake.\n\nAt turn 8, snake at (5,5),(4,5),(3,5), so (1,5) is free.\n\nTo reach (1,5), I need to go left from (3,5) or something.\n\nBut initially, I can't go left.\n\nAfter moving down or right, the tail moves.\n\nFor example, if I move down to (5,4) at turn 8, then tail moves to (4,5), so (3,5) is free.\n\nThen at turn 9, from (5,4), I can move down to (5,3) or right to (6,4).\n\nIf I move down to (5,3), then positions: head (5,3), body (5,4), body (5,5), tail (4,5)\n\nThen at turn 10, move left to (4,3).\n\n(4,3) free.\n\nHead to (4,3), body to (5,3), body to (5,4), tail to (5,5)\n\nThen at turn 11, move left to (3,3).\n\n(3,3) free.\n\nHead to (3,3), body to (4,3), body to (5,3), tail to (5,4)\n\nThen at turn 12, move up to (3,4).\n\n(3,4) free, no obstacle.\n\nHead to (3,4), body to (3,3), body to (4,3), tail to (5,3)\n\nThen at turn 13, move up to (3,5).\n\n(3,5) free, no snake or obstacle.\n\nHead to (3,5), body to (3,4), body to (3,3), tail to (4,3)\n\nThen at turn 14, move left to (2,5).\n\n(2,5) free.\n\nHead to (2,5), body to (3,5), body to (3,4), tail to (3,3)\n\nThen at turn 15, move left to (1,5), eat food.\n\nAt turn 15, life span of (1,5) was 9 at turn 8, so at turn 8 span=9, turn 9 span=8, ..., turn 15 span=9-7=2? Let's calculate.\n\nAt turn t, life span L.\n\nAfter each turn, span decreases.\n\nAt turn 8, L=9.\n\nAfter turn 8 (action taken), span decreases to 8.\n\nAfter turn 9, to 7, ..., after turn 14, to 2, after turn 15 action, if eaten, good, else after turn 15, span=1, still there for turn 16.\n\nAt turn 15, span=2 before action? Let's define.\n\nAt the start of turn t, food has life span S.\n\nIf eaten during turn t, it's consumed.\n\nAfter the turn, if not eaten, S decreases by 1.\n\nIf S=0 after decrease, it disappears.\n\nFor (1,5) at turn 8, S=9.\n\nStart turn 8: S=9, if not eaten, after turn 8, S=8.\n\nStart turn 9: S=8, if not eaten, after turn 9, S=7.\n\n...\n\nStart turn 15: S=9 - (15-8) = 9-7=2, if not eaten, after turn 15, S=1.\n\nStart turn 16: S=1, if not eaten, after turn 16, S=0, disappear.\n\nSo at turn 15, it can be eaten with S=2>0.\n\nIn the path, at turn 15, I move to (1,5) and eat it.\n\nSimilarly, during this path, I didn't eat other food, but I survived and ate (1,5).\n\nI could have eaten (6,4) but it expired.\n\n(6,4) S=3 at turn 8, start turn 8 S=3, if not eaten by turn 10, after turn 10 S=0 disappear.\n\nTurn 10: start S=3-2=1? Turn 8 S=3, after turn 8 S=2, turn 9 S=2, after turn 9 S=1, turn 10 S=1, after turn 10 S=0 disappear. So can be eaten until turn 10.\n\nIn the path above, I was at (5,3) or (4,3) on turn 10, not near (6,4), so I missed it.\n\nSimilarly, (6,6) S=6, available longer.\n\nBut (6,6) is risky.\n\nNow, if I move right at turn 8 to (6,5), then at turn 9 move down to (6,4) to eat, then at turn 10 move left to (5,4), then at turn 11 move down to (5,3), then continue to (4,3), etc., to reach (1,5) by turn 15 or earlier.\n\nWith eating (6,4), so score +1 earlier.\n\nThen eat (1,5) later.\n\nAlso, (6,6) is there, but I can avoid it.\n\nTo maximize, I could eat both (6,4) and (1,5).\n\nBut (6,6) might not be worth the risk.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to output actions for multiple turns, but the instruction is to think 5+ turns ahead, but output actions starting from turn t1.\n\nThe answer format is to output actions for turns t1, t1+1, etc., but it doesn't specify how many, but since it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I should output at least 5 turns of actions.\n\nBut the state is at turn t1=8, so output actions for turn 8,9,10,11,12, etc.\n\nBut I need to decide based on long-term.\n\nSince the grid is small, I can plan a sequence.\n\nPrioritize survival and eating available food.\n\n(6,4) can be eaten easily if I go right then down.\n\n(1,5) can be eaten later.\n\nAlso, there might be other food, but only these.\n\n(2,2) is expired.\n\nSo let's go for eating (6,4) and then to (1,5).\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 8: move R to (6,5)  // from (5,5)\n\nTurn 9: move D to (6,4)  // eat food, grow to length 4\n\nTurn 10: move L to (5,4)  // only choice\n\nNow at (5,4), head direction L.\n\nTurn 11: move D to (5,3)  // can move down or up, but up to (5,5) is possible, but down to (5,3) is better for going left.\n\nMove down to (5,3)\n\nThen Turn 12: move L to (4,3)\n\nTurn 13: move L to (3,3)\n\nTurn 14: move U to (3,4)\n\nTurn 15: move U to (3,5)\n\nTurn 16: move L to (2,5)\n\nTurn 17: move L to (1,5) eat food\n\nBut at turn 17, (1,5) life span: at turn 8 S=9, after 8 turns, at turn 16 start, S=9-8=1? Let's calculate turns.\n\nTurn 8: start, S=9 for (1,5)\n\nAfter turn 8: S=8\n\nTurn 9: start S=8, after turn 9: S=7\n\n...\n\nAfter turn 16: S=9-9=0? Number of decreases.\n\nFrom turn 8 to turn 16, 9 turns? Turn 8 to 16 is 9 actions? Turns: turn 8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16: that's 9 turns.\n\nAt start turn 8: S=9\n\nAfter turn 8 action: if not eaten, S decreases to 8\n\nAfter turn 9: S=7\n\n...\n\nAfter turn 15: S=9 - 8 =1 (decreased 8 times from turn 8 to after turn 15)\n\nList:\n\n- After turn 8: S=8\n\n- After turn 9: S=7\n\n- After turn 10: S=6\n\n- After turn 11: S=5\n\n- After turn 12: S=4\n\n- After turn 13: S=3\n\n- After turn 14: S=2\n\n- After turn 15: S=1\n\n- After turn 16: S=0, disappear\n\nSo at turn 16 start, S=1, can be eaten on turn 16.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 16, I move to (2,5), not to (1,5) yet.\n\nAt turn 17, move to (1,5), but after turn 16, S=0, so disappeared, cannot eat.\n\nMistake.\n\nAt turn 16 start, S=1 for (1,5), so if I eat on turn 16, it's ok.\n\nBut in the sequence, at turn 16, I am at (3,5), moving to (2,5), not to (1,5).\n\nTo eat on turn 16, I need to be at (1,5) on turn 16.\n\nFrom the path, at turn 15, I am at (3,5), to (1,5) is |3-1| + |5-5| =2 cells, so min 2 moves, cannot reach in one turn.\n\nAt turn 14, I am at (3,4), to (1,5) is |3-1| + |4-5| =2+1=3 cells, min 3 moves.\n\nAt turn 13, at (3,3), to (1,5) |3-1| + |3-5| =2+2=4 cells.\n\nSo to reach (1,5) by turn 16, I need to be there on turn 16.\n\nFrom current, at turn 8, head at (5,5), to (1,5) distance 4 left, but blocked.\n\nAfter moving, it takes time.\n\nShortest path: for example, turn 8: move down to (5,4) -- then tail moves, (3,5) free.\n\nTurn 9: move left? From (5,4), can move left? (4,4) is obstacle, cannot move left. Only down or right.\n\nIf move down to (5,3), then turn 10: move left to (4,3), turn 11: move left to (3,3), turn 12: move up to (3,4), turn 13: move up to (3,5), turn 14: move left to (2,5), turn 15: move left to (1,5) -- at turn 15, eat.\n\nAt turn 15 start, for (1,5), S=9 - (15-8) =9-7=2, so can eat.\n\nSimilarly, with initial move right, similar.\n\nBut with initial move right, I ate (6,4), so I can reach (1,5) later but not by turn 15 if I take detour.\n\nIn the sequence with move right: turn 8 R to (6,5), turn 9 D to (6,4) eat, turn 10 L to (5,4), turn 11 D to (5,3), turn 12 L to (4,3), turn 13 L to (3,3), turn 14 U to (3,4), turn 15 U to (3,5), turn 16 L to (2,5), turn 17 L to (1,5) but S=0 after turn 16, so cannot eat on turn 17.\n\nAt turn 15, at (3,5), to (1,5) is 2 cells left, but I move to (3,5) on turn 15, then on turn 16 I can move to (2,5), but (1,5) is not adjacent, so cannot eat on turn 16.\n\nOnly on turn 15 if I am at (2,5) or (1,4) or (1,6), but (1,4) is obstacle, (1,6) may be out of bound or not, but (1,5) only adjacent are (1,4) obstacle, (1,6) y=6, (0,5) x=0 wall, (2,5).\n\nSo to eat (1,5), I need to move to it from (2,5) or (1,6) or (0,5) but (0,5) wall, (1,6) if exist, but y=6, not wall, but not adjacent vertically? Adjacent cells: (x±1,y), (x,y±1).\n\nSo for (1,5): (0,5) wall, (2,5), (1,4) obstacle, (1,6) -- y=6, not wall, is it free? No obstacle listed, so free.\n\n(1,6) is not listed as obstacle, so should be free.\n\nSo I can approach from (2,5) or (1,6).\n\nFor example, from (3,5), I can go to (2,5) then to (1,5), or to (3,6) then to (2,6) then to (1,6) then to (1,5), but longer.\n\nShortest to (1,5) from current.\n\nBut to eat by turn 15 or 16.\n\nWith initial move down to (5,4) at turn 8.\n\nTurn 9: move down to (5,3)\n\nTurn 10: move left to (4,3)\n\nTurn 11: move left to (3,3)\n\nTurn 12: move up to (3,4)\n\nTurn 13: move up to (3,5)  // at (3,5)\n\nTurn 14: move left to (2,5)\n\nTurn 15: move left to (1,5) eat  // turn 15, S=2 for (1,5), can eat.\n\nNo other food eaten, score +1.\n\nWith initial move right to (6,5) at turn 8.\n\nTurn 9: move down to (6,4) eat  // score +1\n\nTurn 10: move left to (5,4)\n\nTurn 11: move down to (5,3)\n\nTurn 12: move left to (4,3)\n\nTurn 13: move left to (3,3)\n\nTurn 14: move up to (3,4)\n\nTurn 15: move up to (3,5)\n\nNow at turn 15 at (3,5), (1,5) is two cells away.\n\nTurn 16: move left to (2,5)\n\nTurn 17: move left to (1,5) but after turn 16, S=0 for (1,5), so on turn 17 it's gone.\n\nCannot eat.\n\nTo eat on turn 16, from (3,5) at turn 15, I need to be at (1,5) on turn 16, impossible.\n\nFrom turn 14 at (3,4), I can move to (2,4) but (2,4) is obstacle, cannot.\n\nMove to (3,5) on turn 14? In the sequence, at turn 14 I am at (3,4), move up to (3,5) on turn 14? Turn 14 action.\n\nIn the sequence above, at turn 14 I move to (3,4)? Let's correct.\n\nWith move right initial:\n\nTurn 8: R to (6,5)\n\nTurn 9: D to (6,4) eat\n\nTurn 10: L to (5,4)\n\nTurn 11: D to (5,3)\n\nTurn 12: L to (4,3)\n\nTurn 13: L to (3,3)\n\nTurn 14: U to (3,4)\n\nTurn 15: U to (3,5)  // now at (3,5) turn 15\n\nFrom (3,5), at turn 16, I can move left to (2,5), but not to (1,5).\n\nOr, at turn 15 from (3,4), instead of up to (3,5), move left to (2,4) but (2,4) obstacle, cannot.\n\nOr move to (4,4) but (4,4) obstacle.\n\nNo, from (3,4), possible moves: U to (3,5), D to (3,3) but (3,3) is body or not, L to (2,4) obstacle, R to (4,4) obstacle.\n\nSo only U or D.\n\nD to (3,3) is possible, but not helpful.\n\nSo must go to (3,5) on turn 15.\n\nThen turn 16 to (2,5), turn 17 to (1,5) but too late.\n\nSo with this path, I cannot eat (1,5) because of the detour to eat (6,4).\n\nWhereas with initial move down, I can eat (1,5) on turn 15 without eating (6,4).\n\nBut (6,4) gives +1, and (1,5) gives +1, so same score, but with move right I ate one extra.\n\nBut in move right case, I ate (6,4) but missed (1,5), so only one food.\n\nIn move down case, I eat (1,5) but not (6,4), so one food.\n\n(6,4) expires at turn 10, so in move down path, I don't eat it.\n\nBut there is (6,6) with longer life, but dangerous.\n\nSo perhaps both options give one food, but move right allows eating (6,4) quickly.\n\nBut I miss (1,5).\n\nUnless I can eat both.\n\nFor example, after eating (6,4), I go directly to (1,5), but it takes more turns.\n\nFrom (5,4) after turn 10, instead of down, I can go up to (5,5), then left.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nTurn 8: R to (6,5)\n\nTurn 9: D to (6,4) eat\n\nTurn 10: L to (5,4)\n\nNow at (5,4), turn 11: move U to (5,5)  // tail, safe\n\nPositions: before, head (5,4), body (6,4), body (6,5), tail (5,5)? Earlier positions: after turn 10, head (5,4), body (6,4), body (6,5), tail (5,5) for simplicity? From turn 10 move to (5,4): head (5,4), body (6,4), body (6,5), tail (5,5)\n\nMove U to (5,5): head to (5,5), which is tail, so safe.\n\nNew head (5,5), seg1 to (5,4), seg2 to (6,4), tail to (6,5)\n\nThen from (5,5), turn 12, possible moves: U to (5,6) obstacle death, D to (5,4) occupied, L to (4,5) free, R to (6,5) occupied.\n\nSo only L to (4,5)\n\nMove to (4,5), no food.\n\nHead to (4,5), body to (5,5), body to (5,4), tail to (6,4)\n\nThen turn 13: from (4,5), move L to (3,5) or U or D, but U (4,6) may be free, D (4,4) obstacle.\n\nL to (3,5), R to (5,5) occupied.\n\nSo L to (3,5)\n\nThen turn 14: from (3,5), move L to (2,5)\n\nTurn 15: move L to (1,5) eat\n\nAt turn 15, eat (1,5), S=2, ok.\n\nAnd I ate (6,4) at turn 9.\n\nSo score +2.\n\nWith this, I can eat both foods.\n\nIn this sequence:\n\nTurn 8: R to (6,5)\n\nTurn 9: D to (6,4) eat\n\nTurn 10: L to (5,4)\n\nTurn 11: U to (5,5)  // move to tail\n\nTurn 12: L to (4,5)\n\nTurn 13: L to (3,5)\n\nTurn 14: L to (2,5)\n\nTurn 15: L to (1,5) eat\n\nAll safe moves.\n\nAnd I avoid (6,6).\n\nFor the answer, I need to output actions for several turns.\n\nSince I thought ahead, I can output for turn 8 to 12 or so.\n\nBut the format is to output in a box.\n\nAlso, for turn 8, I have two choices, but with move R I can eat both, with move D only one.\n\nSo better to move R at turn 8.\n\nThen the actions.\n\nBut in the sequence, at turn 11, I move U to (5,5), which is safe.\n\nThen L to (4,5), etc.\n\nNow, to confirm the grid: (4,5) is free, no obstacle.\n\n(3,5) free, (2,5) free, (1,5) free.\n\nNo issues.\n\nI think this is good.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 8: R (right)\n\nTurn 9: D (down)\n\nTurn 10: L (left)\n\nTurn 11: U (up)\n\nTurn 12: L (left)\n\nAnd so on, but for the answer, perhaps 5 turns or more.\n\nSince the instruction says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I can output for 5 turns.\n\nBut in the sequence, after turn 12, I go to (4,5), then to (3,5), etc.\n\nFor the box, output from turn 8.\n\nAlso, head direction: at turn 8, after move R, direction R.\n\nTurn 9 move D, direction D.\n\nTurn 10 move L, direction L.\n\nTurn 11 move U, direction U.\n\nTurn 12 move L, but from U, moving L is not reverse, since reverse would be D, so ok.\n\nReverse only to current direction.\n\nCurrent direction before move.\n\nFor example, at turn 11, before move, head at (5,4), last move was L (from turn 10, moved L to (5,4), so direction L.\n\nThen move U, not reverse, so ok.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo for answer:\n\n\\boxed{ Turn 8: R (right) Turn 9: D (down) Turn 10: L (left) Turn 11: U (up) Turn 12: L (left) }\n\nBut to be precise, I can add more turns, but 5 turns should be fine, as per thinking ahead.\n\nTurn 13: L to (3,5), etc.\n\nBut for the format, I think up to turn 12 is 5 actions: turn 8 to 12 inclusive is 5 turns.\n\nTurn 8,9,10,11,12: five actions.\n\nYes.\n</think>\n### Analysis and Plan\n\n**Current State (Turn 8):**\n- **Grid Size:** 8x8 (borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7).\n- **Internal Obstacles:** (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3).\n- **Snake Positions:** Head at (5,5), body at (4,5), tail at (3,5). Length = 3.\n- **Head Direction:** Right (R).\n- **Food:**\n  - (2,2): Value +1, Life span 2 (disappears after turn 9).\n  - (6,4): Value +1, Life span 3 (disappears after turn 10).\n  - (6,6): Value +1, Life span 6 (disappears after turn 13).\n  - (1,5): Value +1, Life span 9 (disappears after turn 16).\n\n**Immediate Constraints and Risks:**\n- **Turn 8 Moves from (5,5):** \n  - Up (U) to (5,6): Blocked by obstacle (5,6), deadly.\n  - Down (D) to (5,4): Safe, empty cell.\n  - Left (L) to (4,5): Occupied by body segment (not tail), collision deadly.\n  - Right (R) to (6,5): Safe, empty cell.\n- **Valid Moves for Turn 8:** Down (D) or Right (R).\n- **Food Availability:**\n  - (2,2): Cannot be eaten (distance too far; min 6 moves from (5,5), but life span only until turn 9). Ignore.\n  - (6,4) and (6,6): Reachable but (6,6) is high-risk (dead end due to walls/obstacles). Prioritize (6,4) for immediate score with lower risk.\n  - (1,5): Safe and reachable by turn 15 with a planned path.\n\n**Long-Term Strategy (5+ Turns Ahead):**\n- **Survival First:** Avoid (6,6) due to trap risk (no escape after eating). Target (6,4) for +1 score now, then path to (1,5) for another +1.\n- **Path to (1,5):** Requires moving left, but initially blocked. After initial moves, the tail moves, freeing (3,5). Plan a safe route via (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), to (1,5).\n- **Sequence for Maximum Score:** \n  - Turn 8: Move R to (6,5) to position for (6,4).\n  - Turn 9: Move D to (6,4) to eat (+1 score, length 4).\n  - Turn 10: Move L to (5,4) (only safe move).\n  - Turn 11: Move U to (5,5) (safe, tail cell).\n  - Turn 12: Move L to (4,5) (begin path to (1,5)).\n  - Continue to (1,5) by turn 15 for +1 score (life span allows).\n- **Risk Avoidance:** \n  - Bypass (6,6) entirely (dead end: walls at (6,7), (7,6); obstacle at (5,6)).\n  - No negative food present.\n  - All moves avoid walls, obstacles, and body collisions.\n\n**Planned Actions (Turns 8-12):**\n- **Turn 8:** Move R to (6,5) — positions snake to eat (6,4) next turn.\n- **Turn 9:** Move D to (6,4) — eats food (+1 score), snake grows to length 4.\n- **Turn 10:** Move L to (5,4) — only safe move; avoids dead end.\n- **Turn 11:** Move U to (5,5) — safe move to tail cell; enables leftward path.\n- **Turn 12:** Move L to (4,5) — progresses toward (1,5); cell is free after tail movement.\n\n**Beyond Turn 12 (for completion):**\n- Turn 13: Move L to (3,5) — continue to (1,5).\n- Turn 14: Move L to (2,5) — approach (1,5).\n- Turn 15: Move L to (1,5) — eats food (+1 score), snake grows to length 5.\n\nThis plan yields +2 score (from (6,4) and (1,5)) with minimal risk, prioritizing long-term survival over immediate gains.\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn 8: R (right)} \\\\ \\text{Turn 9: D (down)} \\\\ \\text{Turn 10: L (left)} \\\\ \\text{Turn 11: U (up)} \\\\ \\text{Turn 12: L (left)} }",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 10, and I have to plan my moves for the next few turns to maximize score while avoiding risks. I should think at least 5 turns ahead.\n\nThe grid is 8x8 since borders are x=0, x=7 and y=0, y=7, so coordinates from (0,0) to (7,7). Walls include borders and internal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3).\n\nSnake positions: head at (6,4), then body segments at (6,5), (5,5), (4,5). So the snake is 4 segments long. Head direction is down, which is D. That means the snake was moving down to (6,4) from (6,5)? Let's see: positions are head first, so from head to tail: (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5). Since head direction is D, it was moving down to (6,4), so from (6,5) to (6,4) is down, yes.\n\nNow, food:\n\n- (6,6) with life span 5, value +1 (positive food)\n\n- (1,5) with life span 7, value +1\n\n- (3,2) with life span 10, value +1\n\nAll food is positive, no negative food here. But I need to be careful about the tail reward danger.\n\nLife span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 10:\n\n- Food at (6,6) has life span 5, so it will disappear after 5 more turns? Life span is how many turns it will last, including current turn. So if life span is N at turn t, it disappears at the end of turn t + N - 1? Let's clarify.\n\nThe rule says: \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nSo at turn t, if life span is N, then after this turn, life span becomes N-1, and it disappears when life span reaches 0. So if life span is N at turn t, it will be present for turns t, t+1, ..., t+N-1, and disappear at turn t+N.\n\nFor food at (6,6): life span 5 at turn 10, so it will be there until turn 14 (turns 10,11,12,13,14), disappears at turn 15.\n\nSimilarly, (1,5) life span 7 at turn 10: turns 10 to 16, disappears turn 17.\n\n(3,2) life span 10: turns 10 to 19, disappears turn 20.\n\nNow, snake head at (6,4), direction down. Possible moves: U, D, L, R. But cannot move opposite to current direction, so since head direction is D (down), I cannot move up (U) next, because that would be instant reverse.\n\nCurrent head direction is D, meaning it just moved down to (6,4), so from (6,5) to (6,4). So next move, I cannot move up to (6,5) because that's opposite direction. So forbidden moves: U (up).\n\nAllowed moves: D (down), L (left), R (right). But I have to consider walls and collisions.\n\nFirst, grid boundaries: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Moving outside is wall collision.\n\nAlso internal walls: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3)\n\nNow, head at (6,4). Possible moves:\n\n- D (down): to (6,3). But (6,3) is a wall! (6,3) is an internal obstacle, so I cannot move there. Wall collision.\n\n- L (left): to (5,4). Is this a wall? Internal obstacles: (5,6) is one, but (5,4) is not listed, so it should be free. Walls are only the specified ones.\n\n- R (right): to (7,4). x=7 is border wall, since x=0 and x=7 are walls. \"Border cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7\" so yes, x=7 and y=7 are walls. y=0 and y=7? y=0/y=7, so all cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls.\n\nIn the state: \"Border Cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7.\" So cells where x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls.\n\nAlso internal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3)\n\nSo for head at (6,4):\n\n- D (down) to (6,3): (6,3) is an internal obstacle, so wall, cannot move.\n\n- U (up) to (6,5): but (6,5) is the body segment. Snake positions: (6,4) head, then (6,5), (5,5), (4,5). So (6,5) is the first body segment. If I move up to (6,5), that's a body collision, which is deadly. Also, since I cannot move opposite direction anyway, U is forbidden.\n\nCannot move U because of no instant reverse.\n\n- R (right) to (7,4): x=7 is border wall, cannot move.\n\n- L (left) to (5,4): now, is (5,4) occupied? Snake body: (6,4) head, (6,5), (5,5), (4,5). (5,4) is not in snake positions. Walls: internal obstacles include (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3). (4,4) is a wall? (4,4) is listed as internal obstacle. So (4,4) is wall. But (5,4) is not listed, so it should be free.\n\nInternal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3). So (5,4) is not an obstacle, not border, so it should be movable.\n\nBut is it occupied by snake? Snake positions: (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5). So (5,4) is not occupied. So moving left to (5,4) should be possible.\n\nBut when I move, the snake will move: head to new position, body follows, so the tail will move away from (4,5) to (5,5) or something? Let's think about the movement.\n\nWhen I move, the head moves to a new cell, and each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead. So the tail segment is removed unless I eat food.\n\nIn this case, no food eaten yet, so if I move to (5,4), head goes to (5,4), then the body: second segment moves to where head was, (6,4), third to (6,5), fourth to (5,5), and tail was at (4,5), which is now gone since no growth.\n\nSnake positions after move left to (5,4):\n\n- New head: (5,4)\n\n- Then body: (6,4) - previous head\n\n- Then (6,5) - previous second segment\n\n- Then (5,5) - previous third segment, and tail was (4,5) is left behind.\n\nSo new positions: [(5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5)]\n\nTail is now (5,5), which was previously (5,5) in body.\n\nNow, (5,4) is free, so moving left should be safe.\n\nBut is there any immediate danger? Also, I need to check for collisions.\n\nAfter moving to (5,4), the head is at (5,4), body at (6,4), (6,5), (5,5). So (5,4) is head, and (6,4) is adjacent, but not overlapping, so no collision. Then (6,5) and (5,5) are not adjacent to head? Head at (5,4), adjacent cells: (5,5) is above, which is part of body, but (5,5) is the tail in new position? New positions: head (5,4), then (6,4), (6,5), (5,5). So (5,5) is the tail.\n\nHead at (5,4), tail at (5,5), which is directly above, so they are adjacent vertically.\n\nBut is that a problem? Not immediately, unless I try to eat food there or something.\n\nNow, food locations: (6,6), (1,5), (3,2)\n\n(6,6) is above the snake's current position. Snake head was at (6,4), body at (6,5), so (6,6) is directly above (6,5).\n\nFood at (6,6), which is adjacent to body segment (6,5).\n\nBut to eat it, I need to move to it when it's free. Currently, (6,5) is occupied by body, so I need to move away from it first.\n\nAlso, tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it kills.\n\nBut here, no food on tail yet.\n\nNow, for turn 10, I can only move left to (5,4), because other moves are invalid:\n\n- U: opposite direction, forbidden\n\n- D: to (6,3) wall\n\n- R: to (7,4) border wall\n\n- L: to (5,4) seems possible.\n\nIs there any other option? I think not, so for turn 10, I must move left to (5,4).\n\nBut let's confirm the grid.\n\nGrid: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 cells.\n\nInternal: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3)\n\n(4,4) is wall, so (4,4) cannot be moved to.\n\nNow, from (6,4):\n\n- Left: (5,4) - not wall, not occupied? Occupied by snake? Snake has (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5). (5,4) not in list, so free.\n\nAfter move to (5,4), positions as above.\n\nNow, for future turns, I need to plan ahead.\n\nCurrent turn is 10, I need to output actions for turn 10, 11, 12, etc., but the answer format says \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" but it doesn't specify how many turns to output. Probably a few turns, but since it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I should plan for at least 5 moves.\n\nBut in output, I need to list the actions starting from turn 10.\n\nFor turn 10, action must be L, to (5,4).\n\nThen, after that, head at (5,4), direction is now left, since I moved left.\n\nHead direction changes based on move.\n\nSo after moving left, new head direction is L (left).\n\nNow, from (5,4), possible moves for next turn.\n\nBut let's list the state after turn 10 move.\n\nAfter moving to (5,4) on turn 10:\n\n- New snake positions: head (5,4), then (6,4), (6,5), (5,5)  // tail at (5,5)\n\n- Head direction: L (left)\n\n- Food: same, but life span decreases? The rule says \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so at turn 10, before move, food life span is as given, but after the turn, it decreases.\n\nThe state is given at turn 10, before action.\n\nI take action at turn 10, then after action, state updates.\n\nFor food life span, it decreases after each turn, including turn 10.\n\nSimilarly, for turn 10, after my action, the turn is completed, so life span decreases.\n\nBut in planning, I need to consider the state after each move.\n\nLet me denote the turns.\n\nAt start of turn 10:\n\n- Food life spans: (6,6):5, (1,5):7, (3,2):10\n\nI choose action: L to (5,4)\n\nAfter move:\n\n- Snake: [(5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5)]\n\n- Head direction: L\n\n- Food: since turn 10 completed, life spans decrease by 1.\n\nSo food at turn 11: (6,6):4, (1,5):6, (3,2):9\n\nNow, for turn 11, head at (5,4), direction L.\n\nPossible moves: since direction L, I cannot move right (opposite).\n\nAllowed: U, D, L.\n\nNow, check cells:\n\n- U (up): to (5,5). But (5,5) is the current tail position. After move, positions are [(5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5)], so (5,5) is occupied by tail.\n\nIf I move up to (5,5), I would collide with tail.\n\nBut when I move, the tail moves away, but only after I move.\n\nLet's think carefully.\n\nWhen I move to a cell, if that cell is occupied by the tail, and I eat food, it might be a problem, but here no food.\n\nGeneral rule: moving into tail cell is safe only if the tail moves away at the same time, so no collision.\n\nThe rule says: \"But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo it is safe to move to the tail cell, because the tail moves away.\n\nIn this case, if I move to (5,5), which is tail, it should be safe, because tail will move to where the previous segment was.\n\nCurrent positions: head (5,4), body (6,4), (6,5), tail (5,5)\n\nIf I move up to (5,5):\n\n- New head: (5,5)\n\n- Then body segments move: second segment to (5,4) (previous head), third to (6,4) (previous second), fourth to (6,5) (previous third), and tail was (5,5), but now head is there, and tail moves to (6,5), but (6,5) is now occupied by the fourth segment? Let's list:\n\nPrevious positions: index 0: (5,4) head, 1: (6,4), 2: (6,5), 3: (5,5) tail\n\nAfter move up to (5,5):\n\n- New head: (5,5)\n\n- New body: segment 1 moves to where head was: (5,4)\n\n- Segment 2 moves to where segment 1 was: (6,4)\n\n- Segment 3 moves to where segment 2 was: (6,5)\n\n- Tail segment 3 was at (5,5), but now head is there, and since no growth, tail is removed? No, the tail moves to the previous position of segment 2, which is (6,5).\n\nNew positions: head (5,5), then body (5,4), (6,4), (6,5)\n\nTail is now (6,5)\n\nHead is at (5,5), which was the old tail position, but since tail moved, no collision.\n\nAnd (5,5) is now head, and body at (5,4), (6,4), (6,5).\n\nNo collision because the cell was vacated.\n\nSimilarly, if I move to a body cell that is not tail, it would collide, but tail is ok.\n\nIn this case, moving to (5,5) should be safe.\n\nBut is there food? (5,5) has no food, so no eating, just moving.\n\nAfter move, positions: [(5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5)]\n\nNow, other moves:\n\n- D (down): to (5,3). Is (5,3) wall or free? Walls: border y=0 is wall, but y=3>0, x=5 not border. Internal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3). (5,3) not listed, so free. Not occupied by snake? Current positions before move: (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), so (5,3) free. So D to (5,3) possible.\n\n- L (left): to (4,4). But (4,4) is an internal obstacle wall! (4,4) is listed, so cannot move there.\n\n- R (right): to (6,4). But (6,4) is currently a body segment (the second one). If I move right to (6,4), that is occupied by body, not tail, so collision would occur.\n\n(6,4) is the second segment, not tail. Tail is (5,5).\n\nMoving to a non-tail body cell causes collision.\n\nSo for turn 11, from (5,4), possible moves:\n\n- U to (5,5): possible, as above\n\n- D to (5,3): possible\n\n- L to (4,4): wall, impossible\n\n- R to (6,4): body collision, impossible\n\nSo only U or D.\n\nNow, I need to think about food and long-term.\n\nFood locations:\n\n- (6,6): at (6,6), life span 4 at turn 11? After turn 10, life span decreased, so at start of turn 11, (6,6) life span 4.\n\n- (1,5) life span 6\n\n- (3,2) life span 9\n\n(6,6) is close, at (6,6). Current head after turn 10 is at (5,4), so to reach (6,6), I need to go right and up, but from (5,4), (6,6) is at (x+1,y+2), so not adjacent.\n\nAlso, (6,6) is currently occupied? Snake has (6,5) and (6,4), but (6,6) is food, not occupied. But to eat it, I need head to move to (6,6) when it's free.\n\nBut currently, at turn 10 end, positions: (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), so (6,6) is free.\n\nBut if I want to eat (6,6), I need to move to it.\n\nFrom (5,4), I can move U to (5,5), but (5,5) is not food.\n\nOr D to (5,3).\n\nThen from there, to reach (6,6), I need to go to (6,5) first or something.\n\n(6,5) is currently occupied by body at turn 10 end.\n\nAfter turn 11, if I move, body changes.\n\nLet's plan path to food.\n\nFirst, (6,6) is nearby, life span 4, so it will disappear at turn 14 (since at turn 10 span 5, after turn 10 span 4, so present until turn 14, disappear turn 15).\n\nSimilarly, (1,5) is far, at (1,5), which is near the wall, with obstacles.\n\n(3,2) is also far.\n\nBut I should prioritize eating (6,6) if possible, since it's close.\n\nBut to eat (6,6), I need to move to it.\n\nFrom current head at (5,4) after turn 10 move.\n\nI can move U to (5,5) or D to (5,3).\n\nIf I move U to (5,5) on turn 11:\n\nThen positions: head (5,5), body (5,4), (6,4), (6,5)\n\nHead direction U (since moved up).\n\nThen from (5,5), I can move to adjacent cells.\n\n(5,5) can move U to (5,6), but (5,6) is an internal obstacle wall! (5,6) is listed, so cannot.\n\nD to (5,4): but (5,4) is now body, and moving down from (5,5) to (5,4) is opposite to current direction? After moving up to (5,5), head direction is U, so moving down would be opposite, forbidden.\n\nL to (4,5): (4,5) is not wall? Internal obstacles: (4,4) is wall, but (4,5) not listed. But (4,5) was the old tail, but now it's free? After turn 10 move, positions are (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), so (4,5) is free. And not wall, so possible.\n\nR to (6,5): (6,5) is body segment, not tail, so moving to it would cause collision.\n\nAfter turn 11 if I moved U to (5,5), positions: (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5)\n\nSo (6,5) is the tail now? Segments: head (5,5), then (5,4), (6,4), (6,5) tail.\n\nSo (6,5) is tail.\n\nIf I move right to (6,5), since it's tail, it should be safe, because tail moves away.\n\nSimilarly, moving to other cells.\n\nBut let's not get ahead.\n\nBack to turn 11 choices from (5,4):\n\nOption 1: move U to (5,5)\n\nThen head at (5,5), direction U.\n\nFrom there, for turn 12, possible moves:\n\n- U to (5,6): wall, impossible\n\n- D to (5,4): but (5,4) is body, and moving down from U direction is opposite, forbidden\n\n- L to (4,5): possible, since (4,5) free and not wall\n\n- R to (6,5): possible, since (6,5) is tail, and moving to tail is safe.\n\nIf I move R to (6,5), new head (6,5), body (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), tail moves to (6,4)? Previous positions: head (5,5), body (5,4), (6,4), tail (6,5)\n\nMove to (6,5): new head (6,5), body moves to (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), so new tail (6,4)\n\nNo collision.\n\nThen from (6,5), I can move to (6,6) to eat food, but (6,6) is food.\n\nIf on turn 12 I move to (6,6) from (6,5), which is up.\n\nBut head direction after moving to (6,5) would be R (right), so moving up is allowed.\n\nMove to (6,6): eat food, since (6,6) has food, positive, so snake grows, new tail added.\n\nBut I need to check if it's safe.\n\nFirst, back to turn 11.\n\nIf on turn 11 I move U to (5,5), then on turn 12 I can move R to (6,5), then on turn 13 I can move U to (6,6) to eat.\n\nBut let's see the positions.\n\nAfter turn 11 U to (5,5): positions (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5)\n\nTurn 12, from (5,5) move R to (6,5): now, (6,5) is tail, so move to it, new head (6,5), body (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), tail was (6,5) but now head, so new positions: head (6,5), then (5,5), (5,4), (6,4)  // tail (6,4)\n\nNo growth, since no food eaten.\n\nThen turn 13, from (6,5) move U to (6,6): (6,6) has food, so eat it, snake grows.\n\nNew positions: head to (6,6), then body: previous head (6,5) becomes second, then (5,5), (5,4), and new tail added, so tail is (6,4)? When eating, the tail doesn't move, so new segment added where tail was.\n\nAfter move to (6,6), head (6,6), body segments: previous head (6,5) becomes first body, then (5,5), (5,4), and since ate food, add new tail at previous tail position, which was (6,4), so new positions: [(6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4)]\n\nNow, head at (6,6), body at (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4)\n\nIs there collision? Head at (6,6), adjacent to (6,5), which is body, but not overlapping, so ok.\n\nBut (6,6) is also near the border? x=6, y=6, not border, but internal? No walls at (6,6), but (6,3) is wall, but (6,6) is fine.\n\nLife span of (6,6) at turn 13: started at turn 10 with span 5, after turn 10 span 4, turn 11 span 3, turn 12 span 2, turn 13 span 1, so at turn 13, it has span 1, I eat it, then after turn, span decreases to 0, disappears, but I ate it.\n\nNow, but I need to think if this path is possible.\n\nFrom turn 11, if I move U to (5,5), then turn 12 move R to (6,5), turn 13 move U to (6,6) to eat.\n\nBut on turn 13, when I move to (6,6), is it safe? Head at (6,6), body at (6,5), which is directly below, so adjacent, but no collision.\n\nThen after eating, snake longer.\n\nBut let's see the other option for turn 11.\n\nIf on turn 11, from (5,4) I move D to (5,3) instead.\n\nThen to reach (6,6), it might take longer.\n\n(5,3) to (6,6) is farther.\n\nAlso, (5,3) is at y=3, and walls below, but y=0 wall, so moving down might be risky.\n\nFirst, if I move D to (5,3) on turn 11:\n\nFrom (5,4) move D to (5,3), new head (5,3), direction D.\n\nBody: (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5)? After turn 10 move, positions (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5)\n\nMove D to (5,3): new head (5,3), body moves to (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), tail was (5,5) moves to (6,5)? New positions: head (5,3), then (5,4), (6,4), (6,5)  // tail (6,5)\n\nNow, from (5,3), for next moves, I can try to go to (6,6), but from (5,3) to (6,6) is (x+1,y+3), so multiple moves, and (6,6) life span only 4 at turn 11, so by turn 13 or 14 it might be gone.\n\nAt turn 11, span 4, so after turn 11: span 3, turn 12: span 2, turn 13: span 1, turn 14: span 0, disappear. So I need to eat by turn 13.\n\nFrom (5,3) at turn 11 end, to (6,6): I need to move right and up.\n\nBut from (5,3), possible moves for turn 12: head at (5,3), direction D.\n\nCan move: U, D, L, R? Cannot move U, opposite to D.\n\nDirection D, so cannot move U.\n\nAllowed: D, L, R.\n\nNow, cells:\n\n- D to (5,2): y=2>0, not border, not wall? Internal walls: (5,6), (1,4), etc., not (5,2), so free. Not occupied? Positions: (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), so (5,2) free.\n\n- L to (4,3): not wall, free.\n\n- R to (6,3): but (6,3) is internal obstacle wall! Cannot.\n\nSo only D or L.\n\nIf I move D to (5,2), or L to (4,3).\n\nThen to reach (6,6), I need to go right, but from (5,2) or (4,3), it might take time, and (6,6) disappears after turn 14, so by turn 13 I need to be at (6,6) to eat.\n\nFrom turn 11: head (5,3)\n\nTurn 12: say move R not possible, only D or L.\n\nIf move D to (5,2), then turn 13, head at (5,2), direction D.\n\nThen can move: D to (5,1), L to (4,2), R to (6,2)? R to (6,2): (6,2) not wall, free? But to go up to (6,6), from (5,2) I can move R to (6,2) if possible.\n\nOn turn 12 from (5,3), if I move L to (4,3), even worse.\n\nBut let's not digress, since (6,6) is only available until turn 13 to eat (since turn 14 it has span 1, I can eat on turn 14? At turn 14, if span 1, I can eat on turn 14, then after turn it disappears.\n\nLife span: at turn t, if span N, I can eat on turn t if I move to it, and after turn, span decreases to N-1.\n\nFor (6,6): at turn 10, span 5; turn 11, span 4; turn 12, span 3; turn 13, span 2; turn 14, span 1; turn 15, span 0 disappear.\n\nSo I can eat on turn 14, with span 1.\n\nSimilarly, on turn 13 with span 2, etc.\n\nBut to be safe, I should aim to eat as soon as possible.\n\nBack to turn 11 choice.\n\nIf I move U to (5,5) on turn 11, I can reach (6,6) by turn 13.\n\nIf I move D to (5,3), I might not reach in time.\n\nFor example, from (5,3) turn 11, move D to (5,2) turn 12, then turn 13 move R to (6,2), then turn 14 move U to (6,3), but (6,3) is wall! Cannot.\n\nFrom (6,2) move U to (6,3) not possible.\n\nFrom (5,2) turn 12, move U to (5,3) but (5,3) is previous position, but after turn 12 move to (5,2), positions: head (5,2), body (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), tail (6,5)? Let's not.\n\nTo go to (6,6), from (5,2), I need to go to (6,2), then (6,3) not possible, so to (6,1) or something, but y=1, then up to (6,2), (6,3) wall, stuck.\n\n(6,3) is wall, so I cannot go to y=3 at x=6.\n\nThe only way to (6,6) is from left or below, but below is y=6, and (5,6) is wall, so from (6,5) or (7,6) but x=7 wall.\n\nSo access to (6,6) is only from (6,5) or (5,6) or (7,6) or (6,7), but (5,6) wall, (7,6) wall, (6,7) border wall, so only from (6,5).\n\n(6,6) can be reached from (6,5), (6,7), (5,6), (7,6).\n\nBut (6,7) y=7 border wall, (5,6) internal wall, (7,6) x=7 border wall, so indeed, only from (6,5).\n\nTherefore, to eat (6,6), I must be at (6,5) and move up to (6,6).\n\nAnd (6,5) must be free to move from.\n\nIn the earlier path, if I go to (5,5) on turn 11, then to (6,5) on turn 12, then to (6,6) on turn 13.\n\nOn turn 12, when I move to (6,5), it was tail, so safe.\n\nThen on turn 13 to (6,6), eat.\n\nNow, if I go down to (5,3) on turn 11, I cannot reach (6,5) easily because of the wall at (6,3) and obstacles.\n\nFor example, from (5,3), I can move L to (4,3) or D to (5,2), but to get to (6,5), I need to go right, but (6,3) is wall, so I have to go around, but time is short.\n\n(6,5) is occupied until I move away.\n\nIn the state after turn 10, (6,5) is body, but after moves, it might be free.\n\nBut with only 2 turns left to position, it might be tight.\n\nSince I can eat on turn 14, from (5,3) on turn 11, move to (4,3) or (5,2), then to (4,4) but (4,4) wall, not possible, to (3,3) etc., hard to reach (6,5) by turn 14.\n\nFor instance, turn 11: (5,3) after move D\n\nTurn 12: say move L to (4,3)\n\nThen turn 13: from (4,3) can move U to (4,4) but wall, or D to (4,2), or L to (3,3), or R to (5,3) which is body.\n\nNot easy to get to (6,5).\n\nSo safer to go for (6,6) via the up path.\n\nMoreover, there is tail reward danger to consider, but not immediate.\n\nAnother food is (1,5), at (1,5), with obstacles like (1,4), (2,4) walls, so (1,5) might be hard to reach, and life span longer.\n\n(3,2) also.\n\nBut (6,6) is easiest.\n\nNow, back to turn 10, I must move L to (5,4), as established.\n\nThen for turn 11, I should move U to (5,5) to set up for (6,6).\n\nBut when I move to (5,5) on turn 11, is there any issue?\n\nAfter moving to (5,5), positions: (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5)\n\nHead at (5,5), and (5,4) is directly below, adjacent.\n\nBut no problem.\n\nThen turn 12, I move R to (6,5), as planned.\n\n(6,5) is tail, so safe.\n\nNew positions: head (6,5), body (5,5), (5,4), (6,4)\n\nTail at (6,4)\n\nNow, head at (6,5), direction R (since moved right).\n\nThen turn 13, move U to (6,6) to eat.\n\n(6,6) has food, so eat, snake grows to length 5.\n\nNew positions: head (6,6), then (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), and new tail at (6,4), so [(6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4)]\n\nNow, after this, I need to think about future moves.\n\nBut for now, I have actions for turn 10,11,12,13.\n\nTurn 10: move L to (5,4)\n\nTurn 11: move U to (5,5)\n\nTurn 12: move R to (6,5)\n\nTurn 13: move U to (6,6) eat\n\nNow, what about turn 14 and beyond? Since I need to think ahead.\n\nAfter eating, head at (6,6), direction U.\n\nNow, possible moves: U to (6,7), but y=7 border wall, cannot.\n\nD to (6,5): but (6,5) is body, and moving down from U direction is opposite? Head direction U, so moving D opposite, forbidden.\n\nL to (5,6): (5,6) is internal obstacle wall, cannot.\n\nR to (7,6): x=7 border wall, cannot.\n\nOh no! Dead end! All moves blocked?\n\nU: wall, D: opposite and body, but D to (6,5) is body, and moving opposite forbidden anyway.\n\nL: wall, R: wall.\n\nSo after moving to (6,6), I am stuck, cannot move anywhere, death on next turn.\n\nBut I have to move, so I would die.\n\nBut I ate the food, but then immediately stuck.\n\nThis is a problem.\n\nIn this path, after eating (6,6), I have no escape because I am surrounded.\n\nSpecifically, after positions: head (6,6), body at (6,5) below, (5,5) left-down, (5,4) left, (6,4) left-down? Positions: (6,6) head, then (6,5) directly below, then (5,5) left, then (5,4) down, then (6,4) right? List: [(6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4)]\n\nSo cells around (6,6):\n\n- U (6,7): y=7 wall\n\n- D (6,5): occupied by body\n\n- L (5,6): wall\n\n- R (7,6): x=7 wall\n\nAll blocked, and since I cannot move to body except tail, but (6,5) is not tail, tail is (6,4), which is not adjacent.\n\n(6,4) is at (6,4), which is down-left from (6,6)? (6,6) to (6,5) is down, (6,5) to (5,5) is left, etc.\n\nAdjacent cells to (6,6): (6,7) U, (6,5) D, (5,6) L, (7,6) R.\n\nAll unavailable: U wall, D body, L wall, R wall.\n\nSo indeed, no possible move, snake dies.\n\nTherefore, eating (6,6) leads to death, so I should avoid it.\n\nBut the food is positive, but if it kills me, not worth it.\n\nI need to choose a different path.\n\nFor turn 11, instead of moving U to (5,5), I should move D to (5,3) to avoid going to (6,6).\n\nThen I can go for other food.\n\nBut (6,6) is the only close food, but it's a trap.\n\nPerhaps I can eat it but have a way out, but in this case, no.\n\nUnless I don't go directly, but I have to be at (6,5) to access it.\n\nFrom other directions, but as we saw, only accessible from (6,5), and after eating, I am stuck.\n\nSo better not to eat (6,6) at all.\n\nThen I should ignore (6,6) and go for other food.\n\nNow, other food: (1,5) and (3,2)\n\n(1,5) is at (1,5), with walls at (1,4), (2,4), so (1,5) might be accessible from above or sides.\n\n(1,5): adjacent cells (1,6), (1,4), (0,5), (2,5)\n\n(1,4) is wall, (0,5) x=0 wall, (2,5) might be free, (1,6) y=6, border? y=7 is border, y=6 not, so (1,6) free if no wall.\n\nInternal walls: (5,6), etc., not (1,6), so (1,6) free.\n\nSimilarly, (2,5) free, not listed wall.\n\nBut (2,4) is wall, so (2,5) should be free.\n\nTo eat (1,5), I can come from (1,6), (2,5), or (0,5) wall, not possible.\n\nSimilarly, (3,2) at (3,2), no nearby walls, should be accessible.\n\nBut both are far from current position.\n\nCurrent after turn 10: head at (5,4)\n\nIf I move D to (5,3) on turn 11, then I can head towards (3,2) or (1,5).\n\nBut (1,5) has shorter life span? (1,5) life span 7 at turn 10, so after decrease, turn 11 span 6, disappear at turn 16.\n\n(3,2) span 10, disappear turn 19.\n\nSo (1,5) sooner.\n\nBut let's plan a safe path.\n\nFirst, for turn 10, must move L to (5,4).\n\nThen turn 11, move D to (5,3) to avoid the trap.\n\nAfter move to (5,3), positions: head (5,3), body (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), tail (5,5)? After turn 10: positions (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5)\n\nMove D to (5,3): new head (5,3), body (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), tail (5,5) moves to (6,5)? New positions: head (5,3), then (5,4), (6,4), (6,5)  // tail (6,5)\n\nHead direction D.\n\nNow, from (5,3), for turn 12, I can move.\n\nPossible moves: direction D, so cannot move U.\n\n- D to (5,2): possible, not wall, free\n\n- L to (4,3): possible\n\n- R to (6,3): wall, impossible\n\nSo D or L.\n\nI should go towards (3,2) or (1,5).\n\n(3,2) is at (3,2), so I need to go left and down.\n\n(1,5) is left and up.\n\nBut with obstacles.\n\nFirst, let's go for (3,2).\n\nFrom (5,3), move L to (4,3) on turn 12.\n\nThen head at (4,3), direction L (since moved left).\n\nThen turn 13, from (4,3), possible moves: direction L, so cannot move R.\n\n- U to (4,4): but (4,4) is internal obstacle wall! Cannot.\n\n- D to (4,2): possible, not wall\n\n- L to (3,3): possible\n\n- R to (5,3): body, and moving right opposite, forbidden anyway.\n\nSo only D or L.\n\nIf move L to (3,3), then to (3,2) next.\n\n(3,3) to (3,2) is down.\n\nBut (3,2) is food.\n\nSo turn 12: from (5,3) move L to (4,3)\n\nTurn 13: from (4,3) move L to (3,3) or D to (4,2)\n\nIf move L to (3,3), head at (3,3), direction L.\n\nThen turn 14, move D to (3,2) to eat.\n\n(3,2) has food, value +1.\n\nLife span at turn 14: started turn 10 span 10, turn 11 span 9, turn 12 span 8, turn 13 span 7, turn 14 span 6, so still available.\n\nAfter eating, snake grows.\n\nBut need to see if safe.\n\nFirst, let's list the moves.\n\nBut for turn 10 and 11, I have:\n\nTurn 10: L\n\nTurn 11: D (to (5,3))\n\nThen turn 12: L to (4,3)\n\nTurn 13: L to (3,3)\n\nTurn 14: D to (3,2) eat\n\nNow, from (3,3) to (3,2), move down.\n\nAfter eating, head at (3,2), body: previous head (3,3) becomes body, then (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), and new tail at (6,5)? Let's trace positions.\n\nStart after turn 10: positions [(5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5)] but after turn 10 move to (5,4), etc.\n\nAfter turn 10: snake [(5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5)] head (5,4)\n\nTurn 11: move D to (5,3), new positions: head (5,3), then (5,4), (6,4), (6,5)  // tail (6,5)\n\nTurn 12: move L to (4,3), new head (4,3), body (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), tail (6,5) moves to (6,4)? New positions: head (4,3), then (5,3), (5,4), (6,4)  // tail (6,4)\n\nTurn 13: move L to (3,3), new head (3,3), body (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), tail (6,4) moves to (5,4)? New positions: head (3,3), then (4,3), (5,3), (5,4)  // tail (5,4)\n\nTurn 14: move D to (3,2), (3,2) has food, so eat, new head (3,2), body (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), and since ate, add new tail at previous tail position, which was (5,4), so new positions: [(3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4)]\n\nNow, head at (3,2), direction D.\n\nPossible moves for next turn: U, D, L, R? Direction D, so cannot move U.\n\n- U to (3,3): body, and opposite direction, forbidden\n\n- D to (3,1): possible, not wall (y=1>0)\n\n- L to (2,2): possible\n\n- R to (4,2): possible\n\n(2,2) and (4,2) should be free.\n\nSo I can move, for example, D to (3,1) or L to (2,2), etc.\n\nNo immediate trap.\n\nSimilarly, I could go for (1,5) but it might be harder with obstacles.\n\n(1,5) has walls at (1,4) and (2,4), so from above or right.\n\nBut since I am at (3,2), I can go up later.\n\nBut for now, this seems safer than the (6,6) trap.\n\nEarlier with (6,6), I died immediately after eating.\n\nSo better to avoid that.\n\nTherefore, for the actions:\n\nTurn 10: move L (to (5,4))\n\nTurn 11: move D (to (5,3))\n\nThen I need to output multiple turns, but I can output up to turn 14 or so.\n\nBut in the plan, turn 12: L to (4,3)\n\nTurn 13: L to (3,3)\n\nTurn 14: D to (3,2) eat\n\nBut after that, I need to think ahead, but for answer, I can list these.\n\nSince the format says to list actions starting from turn 10.\n\nAlso, for turn 10, only one choice, L.\n\nTurn 11, I chose D, but I could have chosen U, but that leads to death, so D is better.\n\nNow, to confirm, is there another food or something.\n\n(1,5) is still there, life span longer.\n\nBut I can go for it after, but not necessary for now.\n\nSo I think this plan is ok.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to output in the boxed format.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 10: L\n\nTurn 11: D\n\nTurn 12: L\n\nTurn 13: L\n\nTurn 14: D\n\nBut turn 14 is D to (3,2) to eat, but in the action, it's just the direction.\n\nI could add more turns, but since thinking 5+ turns ahead, 5 moves from turn 10 to 14.\n\nTurn 10 to turn 14 is 5 turns: 10,11,12,13,14.\n\nYes.\n\nTo be precise.\n\nIn the state, snake head direction is given as D at turn 10, but after moves, it changes.\n\nBut for output, I just need the actions.\n\nSo for turn 10: action L\n\nTurn 11: action D\n\nTurn 12: action L (to (4,3))\n\nTurn 13: action L (to (3,3))\n\nTurn 14: action D (to (3,2))\n\nIn turn 13, when I move to (3,3), it is not food, so no eat, just move.\n\nThen turn 14 move to (3,2) eat.\n\nBut in actions, I don't specify eat, just move.\n\nNow, is there any risk in this path?\n\nFor example, on turn 12, from (5,3) move L to (4,3), but (4,3) is free, no issue.\n\nTurn 13, from (4,3) move L to (3,3), free.\n\nTurn 14, move D to (3,2), eat.\n\nAfter that, I can continue, but not needed for output.\n\nI could consider going for (1,5) instead, but it might be riskier with obstacles.\n\nFor example, from (5,3) after turn 11, instead of moving L, I could move D to (5,2), but then to go to (1,5), I need to go left and up, but with walls.\n\n(1,5) is at y=5, x=1, walls at (1,4) and (2,4), so I need to be at (1,6) or (2,5) to access.\n\nFrom (5,2), moving to (4,2), (3,2) but (3,2) is food, if I go directly, but in this case, I might eat (3,2) first.\n\nBut in my previous plan, I eat (3,2) on turn 14.\n\nIf I go down first, I might eat later, but (3,2) life span long, ok.\n\nBut I think the plan is fine.\n\nSo I'll go with that.\n</think>\n### Analysis and Plan\n\n**Current State (Turn 10):**\n- **Snake Position**: Head at (6,4), body segments at (6,5), (5,5), (4,5). Snake length is 4.\n- **Head Direction**: Down (D). Cannot move up (U) next due to no instant reverse.\n- **Walls**: \n  - Borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (grid is 8x8, coordinates (0,0) to (7,7)).\n  - Internal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3).\n- **Food**:\n  - (6,6): Value +1, life span 5 (disappears after turn 14).\n  - (1,5): Value +1, life span 7 (disappears after turn 16).\n  - (3,2): Value +1, life span 10 (disappears after turn 19).\n\n**Constraints and Risks:**\n- **Turn 10 Moves**: \n  - U (up) to (6,5): Forbidden (opposite direction to current D).\n  - D (down) to (6,3): Wall (internal obstacle), deadly.\n  - R (right) to (7,4): Wall (border), deadly.\n  - L (left) to (5,4): Safe (not wall, not occupied). **Only valid move for turn 10.**\n- **Food at (6,6) is a Trap**: Eating it requires moving from (6,5) to (6,6). After eating, the snake grows to length 5, but the head at (6,6) is surrounded by walls ((5,6) and (7,6)) and body ((6,5)), leaving no escape. **Must avoid this food to survive long-term.**\n- **Other Food**: \n  - (1,5): Risky due to nearby walls ((1,4), (2,4)) and shorter life span (disappears sooner). Path is complex with obstacles.\n  - (3,2): Safer target with longer life span. Accessible via a clear path left/down from (5,4).\n\n**5+ Turn Plan (Prioritize Survival and Scoring):**\n- **Turn 10**: Move L to (5,4) (only safe option).\n- **Turn 11**: From (5,4), move D to (5,3) to avoid the (6,6) trap and head toward (3,2). Moving U to (5,5) leads to the (6,6) death trap, so D is safer.\n- **Turn 12**: From (5,3), move L to (4,3) to continue toward (3,2). Moving R to (6,3) is a wall, and D to (5,2) delays reaching food.\n- **Turn 13**: From (4,3), move L to (3,3) to position for eating (3,2). Moving U to (4,4) is a wall, and D to (4,2) is less direct.\n- **Turn 14**: From (3,3), move D to (3,2) to eat the positive food (+1 score, snake grows to length 5). This is safe, with escape routes (e.g., D to (3,1) or L to (2,2) next).\n- **Beyond Turn 14**: After eating (3,2), head to (1,5) or other areas, but focus on immediate 5-turn plan.\n\n**Actions for Turns 10-14:**\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 10: L (left) \\\\\nTurn 11: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 12: L (left) \\\\\nTurn 13: L (left) \\\\\nTurn 14: D (down)\n}",
