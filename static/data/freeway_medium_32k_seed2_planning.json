        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at position (0, 0) at turn t_1, which is given as t_0 = 0. So t_1 = 0. The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nThe player moves vertically: up (U) increases y by 1, down (D) decreases y by 1, or stay (S) keeps y the same. y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCollisions happen only if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T where y_T is between 1 and 8, and for some car on that freeway, 0 is in its span at that turn. The span is the set of positions the car occupies, and it moves left or right based on direction.\n\nImportant point: if you move to a different y at turn T, you are not on that new y until the next turn. So at turn T, you are on y_T, and you choose an action to go to y_{T+1}. But for collision, it's based on where you are at turn T, so y_T must not have a car where 0 is in span at T.\n\nThe car spans are given at turn t_1 = 0. For future turns T, the span changes based on speed and direction.\n\nLet me denote the current turn as t = 0 for simplicity.\n\nPlayer position: y_0 = 0.\n\nNow, for each freeway, cars are listed with (head, tail, direction, speed). I need to understand the span.\n\nFor a car, the span is given as (head, tail). For left-moving, head is the front, so if moving left, head decreases. Similarly for right-moving, head increases.\n\nIn the car update:\n\n- Left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nSince it's moving left, positions decrease.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving: [τ, h] → [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nIn the right-moving case, they have Span(t_1) = [τ, h], which might imply τ is left and h is right, so [τ, h] with τ < h, I assume.\n\nSimilarly for left, [h, τ] with h > τ, I think.\n\nLet me check the values.\n\nFor example, freeway 1: (-48, -95, right, 48)\n\nDirection right, so at t_1=0, span is [τ, h] = [-48, -95]? That can't be right because -48 is greater than -95, so [τ, h] should have τ < h.\n\n-48 > -95, so if τ = -48 and h = -95, but -48 > -95, so [τ, h] would be from -48 to -95, which is decreasing, but for a car, span should be continuous positions.\n\nI think there might be a confusion in notation.\n\nIn the car update rule:\n\nFor right-moving: \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\"\n\nIt says [τ, h], and then it moves to [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT], so τ and h are both positions, and for right-moving, since it increases, τ should be the left end and h the right end.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving: [h, τ] → [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT], so h should be the right end and τ the left end when moving left.\n\nIn the state, for freeway 1: (-48, -95, right, 48)\n\nSince it's right-moving, Span should be [τ, h], so τ = ? and h = ?\n\nGiven as (-48, -95), but -48 and -95, -48 > -95, so if τ is tail and h is head, for right-moving, tail should be left, head right, so τ < h.\n\nBut here, -48 > -95, so -48 is larger than -95, meaning -48 is to the right of -95? Positions on x-axis, I assume.\n\nLet me assume x-axis, smaller x left, larger x right.\n\nSo, for a car, at position x.\n\nFor right-moving car, it moves to increasing x.\n\nSo, at t=0, span is from some left position to right position.\n\nIn the state, for freeway 1: (-48, -95, right, 48)\n\nBut -48 and -95, since -48 > -95, -48 is to the right of -95? No:\n\n-95 is smaller, so -95 is left, -48 is right, since -95 < -48.\n\nx: smaller x is left, larger x is right.\n\nSo -95 < -48, so -95 is left, -48 is right.\n\nBut for right-moving, the span should be [left, right] or [tail, head]?\n\nIn the update rule, for right-moving: Span(t_1) = [τ, h], and it becomes [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT], so τ is the left end (tail), h is the right end (head).\n\nSimilarly for left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ], becomes [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT], so h is the right end, τ is the left end.\n\nIn freeway 1: (-48, -95, right, 48)\n\nSince right-moving, Span = [τ, h] = [-48, -95]? But -48 > -95, so if [τ, h] with τ = -48, h = -95, but -48 > -95, so this would be from -48 to -95, which is from right to left, but that doesn't make sense for a car span; it should be from left to right.\n\nI think there's a mistake in the notation or my understanding.\n\nPerhaps the numbers are positions, and for right-moving, (head, tail) is given, but in the state it says \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nLook: \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nIn the table: for freeway 1: (-48, -95, right, 48) so head h = -48, tail τ = -95.\n\nBut for right-moving, head should be the front, which is right end, tail is left end.\n\nSo h = -48, τ = -95.\n\nSince -48 > -95, h is at -48 (right), τ at -95 (left), so span is from τ to h, i.e., from -95 to -48.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, head is front, left end, tail is right end.\n\nIn the update rule, it's consistent.\n\nFor right-moving at t_1: span is [τ, h] with τ left, h right.\n\nFor freeway 1: τ = -95, h = -48, so span [ -95, -48 ] at t=0.\n\nThen at time T, span [ -95 + 48(T-0), -48 + 48(T-0) ] = [ -95 + 48T, -48 + 48T ]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, collision occurs at turn T if the player is on freeway y_T, and 0 is in the span of some car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nPlayer is on y_T at turn T.\n\nFor the player to be on a freeway, y_T must be between 1 and 8 inclusive.\n\nAt y=0 and y=9, there are no cars, so no collision possible there.\n\nThe goal is to reach (0,9), so at some turn H, y_H = 9, and since y=9 has no cars, it's safe.\n\nBut we need to reach it, and the position is (0,9), but the x-position is always 0 for the player, I assume, since it's not moving horizontally, only vertically. The grid is 2D, but player only moves vertically, at x=0.\n\nCars are on the freeways, which are horizontal lanes at different y-levels, and they move horizontally, so their position is in x.\n\nPlayer is at x=0, so collision when player at (0, y) and y between 1-8, and at that turn, for some car on that y, 0 is in its span, meaning the car covers x=0.\n\nSo, for each freeway and each turn, I need to know if there is a car such that 0 is in [left, right] of its span at that turn.\n\nSince multiple cars per freeway, but we care if any car has 0 in span.\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need to find when it is safe to be at y=k for k=1 to 8, i.e., when no car on that freeway has 0 in its span at that turn.\n\nThen the player needs to move from y=0 to y=9, changing y by at most 1 per turn, avoiding being on unsafe (y,t) positions.\n\ny starts at 0, and we go to 9, so minimum turns if no cars is 9 turns: from y=0 to y=9 in 9 steps, each U, but since we start at turn 0, position at turn t is y_t.\n\nAt turn 0, y=0.\n\nAfter first action, at turn 1, y=1 if U, or 0 if S, etc.\n\nTo reach y=9, since we start at y=0, we need to increase y by 9, so minimum 9 actions, each U, but we might need to wait or go down to avoid collisions, so H could be more than 9.\n\nBut we want minimal H.\n\nNow, for each freeway, let's find for which turns it is unsafe, i.e., when 0 is covered by some car.\n\nDefine for each freeway k, the set of times T when it is unsafe to be on k, meaning some car has 0 in span at T.\n\nSince t_1=0, T is turn number.\n\nStart with freeway 1: y=1\n\nCars: only one car: (head h, tail τ) = (-48, -95), direction right, speed 48.\n\nSo at t=0, span [τ, h] = [-95, -48]\n\nSince right-moving, span at time T: [ -95 + 48T, -48 + 48T ]\n\n0 in span if -95 + 48T <= 0 <= -48 + 48T\n\nSo, -95 + 48T <= 0 and 0 <= -48 + 48T\n\nFirst inequality: -95 + 48T <= 0 => 48T <= 95 => T <= 95/48 ≈ 1.979, so T <= 1 since T integer? T is turn, discrete.\n\nT is turn number, integer, I assume.\n\nIn the game, turns are discrete, so T integer.\n\nSo -95 + 48T <= 0 => 48T <= 95 => T <= floor(95/48) = 1 since 48*1=48<95, 48*2=96>95, so T <=1? 48T <=95, T<=1.979, so for T=0,1, 48*0=0<95? -95 +0 = -95 <=0 true, T=1: -95+48= -47 <=0 true, T=2: -95+96=1 >0? Let's compute.\n\n-95 + 48T <= 0\n\nFor T=0: -95 <=0 true\n\nT=1: -95+48= -47 <=0 true\n\nT=2: -95+96=1 <=0? 1 <=0 false\n\nSimilarly, second inequality: 0 <= -48 + 48T => 48 <= 48T => T >=1\n\n0 <= -48 + 48T => 48T >=48 => T>=1\n\nSo both: -95 +48T <=0 and 0 <= -48 +48T\n\nFrom above, T<=1 from first? From -95+48T <=0: T <= 95/48 ≈1.979, so T<=1 since T integer? T=0: -95<=0 true, T=1: -47<=0 true, T=2:1<=0 false, so T<=1\n\nBut T<=1 means T=0,1\n\nT>=1 from second inequality.\n\nSo for T=1: -95+48(1)= -47 <=0 true, and 0 <= -48+48=0 true, 0<=0 true.\n\nFor T=0: -95 <=0 true, but 0 <= -48 +0? 0 <= -48 false, so not for T=0.\n\nOnly when both inequalities hold.\n\nSo for T=1: -47 <=0 and 0<=0, true.\n\nT=0: -95<=0 true but 0<= -48 false, so no.\n\nT=2: 1<=0 false, no.\n\nSo only at T=1, 0 is in span.\n\nFor other T, not.\n\nSo freeway 1 is unsafe only at turn T=1.\n\nNow freeway 2: y=2\n\nCars: three cars: (48,37,right,4), (12,1,right,4), (-24,-35,right,4)\n\nAll right-moving, speed 4.\n\nFirst car: head=48, tail=37? But 48>37, so tail=37, head=48? Positions.\n\nGiven as (head, tail), so for first car: head=48, tail=37, but 48>37, so if right-moving, head should be right, tail left, but 48>37, so tail=37 (left), head=48 (right), so span [37,48] at t=0.\n\nSimilarly, second car: (12,1,right,4), head=12, tail=1, so span [1,12]\n\nThird car: (-24,-35,right,4), head=-24, tail=-35, so span [-35,-24]\n\nAll right-moving, speed 4.\n\nSpan at T: for each, [τ + 4T, h + 4T]\n\nFirst car: τ=37, h=48, so [37 +4T, 48+4T]\n\n0 in span: 37+4T <=0 <=48+4T\n\nBut 37+4T >=37>0 for T>=0, so 37+4T >0, so 0 <= 37+4T is false since left end >0, so 0 not in [37+4T,48+4T] for any T, since min position 37>0.\n\nSimilarly, second car: τ=1, h=12, span [1+4T, 12+4T]\n\n1+4T >=1>0, so always greater than 0, 0 not in span.\n\nThird car: τ=-35, h=-24, span [-35+4T, -24+4T]\n\n0 in span if -35+4T <=0 <= -24+4T\n\nFirst: -35+4T <=0 => 4T <=35 => T<=8.75, so T<=8\n\nSecond: 0 <= -24+4T => 4T >=24 => T>=6\n\nSo both: T>=6 and T<=8\n\nT=6: -35+24= -11 <=0 true, 0 <= -24+24=0 true\n\nT=7: -35+28= -7 <=0 true, 0 <= -24+28=4 true\n\nT=8: -35+32= -3 <=0 true, 0 <= -24+32=8 true\n\nT=9: -35+36=1 <=0 false, no\n\nSo for third car, unsafe at T=6,7,8\n\nFirst and second cars never have 0 in span, so overall for freeway 2, unsafe when the third car covers 0, at T=6,7,8.\n\nNow freeway 3: y=3\n\nCars: (48,37,right,12), (0,-11,right,12)\n\nBoth right-moving, speed 12.\n\nFirst car: head=48, tail=37, span [37,48] at t=0\n\nAt T: [37+12T, 48+12T]\n\n37+12T >=37>0, so 0 not in span for any T.\n\nSecond car: head=0, tail=-11? (0,-11,right,12)\n\nHead=0, tail=-11, so span [τ, h] = [-11, 0] at t=0? τ = tail = -11, h = head = 0.\n\nSince right-moving, span [τ, h] = [-11, 0] at t=0.\n\nAt T: [ -11 + 12T, 0 + 12T ] = [ -11 + 12T, 12T ]\n\n0 in span if -11+12T <= 0 <= 12T\n\nFirst: -11+12T <=0 => 12T <=11 => T <= 11/12 ≈ 0.916, so T <=0 since T integer? T=0: -11 <=0 true, T=1: -11+12=1>0? -11+12=1 <=0? 1<=0 false.\n\n-11+12T <=0\n\nT=0: -11<=0 true\n\nT=1: 1<=0 false? -11+12=1, 1<=0 false.\n\nSimilarly, second inequality: 0 <= 12T, which for T>=0 always true except T=0? 0 <= 12T, for T=0, 0<=0 true, T>0 true.\n\nBut for 0 <= 12T, at T=0, 0<=0 true.\n\nNow, both: -11+12T <=0 and 0 <=12T\n\nAt T=0: -11 <=0 true and 0<=0 true, so 0 in span.\n\nAt T=1: -11+12=1 <=0 false, so not.\n\nSo only at T=0, for this car.\n\nFirst car never, so freeway 3 unsafe only at T=0.\n\nBut at T=0, player is at y=0, not on freeway 3, so for when player is on y=3, it might be safe except at T=0, but T=0 player not there.\n\nFor freeway 3, unsafe only at T=0, but since player might be at y=3 at other times, it is safe for T>0.\n\nNow freeway 4: y=4\n\nCars: (48,37,right,12), (0,-11,right,12) same as freeway 3.\n\nIdentical to freeway 3.\n\nSo unsafe only at T=0.\n\nSimilarly, safe for T>0.\n\nFreeway 5: y=5\n\nCars: (-48,-59,right,6), (0,-11,right,6)\n\nBoth right-moving, speed 6.\n\nFirst car: head=-48, tail=-59? (head, tail) = (-48,-59)\n\nSince right-moving, head=-48, tail=-59, so τ = -59 (left), h = -48 (right), span [-59, -48] at t=0.\n\nAt T: [-59 +6T, -48 +6T]\n\n0 in span: -59+6T <=0 <= -48+6T\n\nFirst: -59+6T <=0 => 6T <=59 => T<=59/6≈9.833, so T<=9\n\nSecond: 0 <= -48+6T => 6T >=48 => T>=8\n\nSo both: T>=8 and T<=9\n\nT=8: -59+48= -11 <=0 true, 0 <= -48+48=0 true\n\nT=9: -59+54= -5 <=0 true, 0 <= -48+54=6 true\n\nT=10: -59+60=1 <=0 false, no\n\nSecond car: (0,-11,right,6) head=0, tail=-11, span [-11,0] at t=0? τ = -11, h=0, so [-11,0]\n\nAt T: [-11+6T, 0+6T] = [-11+6T, 6T]\n\n0 in span: -11+6T <=0 <=6T\n\nFirst: -11+6T <=0 => 6T <=11 => T<=11/6≈1.833, so T<=1\n\nSecond: 0 <=6T, always for T>=0\n\nSo at T=0: -11<=0 true, 0<=0 true\n\nT=1: -11+6= -5 <=0 true, 0 <=6 true\n\nT=2: -11+12=1 <=0 false, no\n\nSo second car unsafe at T=0 and T=1\n\nNow for freeway 5, unsafe if either car has 0 in span.\n\nFirst car at T=8,9\n\nSecond car at T=0,1\n\nSo overall, unsafe at T=0,1,8,9\n\nFreeway 6: y=6\n\nCars: (48,71,left,24)\n\nDirection left, so moving left.\n\nHead and tail: (head, tail) = (48,71)\n\nFor left-moving, head is front, which is left end? In the update, for left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT]\n\nAnd it says [h, τ], so for left-moving, h is the right end, τ is the left end? Let's see.\n\nIn the rule: \"Left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\"\n\nSince it moves left, positions decrease, so at t_1, [h, τ] with h and τ, and after moving left, both decrease.\n\nFor left-moving, the head is the front when moving left, so if moving left, head should be at higher x initially? Let's think.\n\nSuppose at t_1, the car is moving left, so its head (front) is at position, say, h, and tail at τ, with h < τ? I think I have confusion.\n\nStandard: for a car moving left, as time increases, all positions decrease.\n\nThe span is given as a set.\n\nIn the update, for left-moving: from [h, τ] to [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT]\n\nSince both decrease, and the span moves left.\n\nThe values: h and τ, but which is left/right.\n\nFor freeway 6: (48,71,left,24)\n\nh=48, τ=71, but 48<71, so if [h, τ] = [48,71], which from 48 to 71, so left end 48, right end 71.\n\nBut it is moving left, so at later time, both positions decrease.\n\nAt T, span [48 - 24T, 71 - 24T]\n\n0 in span if 48 - 24T <= 0 <= 71 - 24T\n\nFirst inequality: 48 - 24T <=0 => 48 <=24T => T>=2\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <=71 -24T => 24T <=71 => T<=71/24≈2.958, so T<=2\n\nT>=2 and T<=2, so only T=2.\n\nAt T=2: 48-48=0 <=0 true, 0 <=71-48=23 true? 0<=23 true.\n\nAnd 48-24(2)=48-48=0, 71-48=23, so [0,23], 0 included.\n\nAt T=3: 48-72= -24 <=0 true, but 0 <=71-72= -1? 0 <= -1 false, so not.\n\nSo only at T=2.\n\nThus freeway 6 unsafe only at T=2.\n\nFreeway 7: y=7\n\nCars: (48,71,left,24) same as freeway 6.\n\nIdentical, so unsafe only at T=2.\n\nFreeway 8: y=8\n\nCars: (48,83,left,36)\n\nLeft-moving, head=48, tail=83, so span [h, τ] = [48,83] at t=0\n\nAt T: [48 - 36T, 83 - 36T]\n\n0 in span: 48-36T <=0 <=83-36T\n\nFirst: 48-36T <=0 => 48<=36T => T>=48/36=4/3≈1.333, so T>=2\n\nSecond: 0 <=83-36T => 36T <=83 => T<=83/36≈2.305, so T<=2\n\nT>=2 and T<=2, so only T=2.\n\nAt T=2: 48-72= -24 <=0 true, 0 <=83-72=11 true? 0<=11 true.\n\n48-36(2)=48-72= -24, 83-72=11, so [-24,11], 0 in it.\n\nAt T=1: 48-36=12 <=0 false? 12 <=0 false, so not.\n\nAt T=3: 48-108= -60 <=0 true, 0 <=83-108= -25 false.\n\nSo only T=2.\n\nNow, summarize unsafe times for each freeway:\n\ny=1: unsafe at T=1\n\ny=2: unsafe at T=6,7,8\n\ny=3: unsafe at T=0\n\ny=4: unsafe at T=0\n\ny=5: unsafe at T=0,1,8,9\n\ny=6: unsafe at T=2\n\ny=7: unsafe at T=2\n\ny=8: unsafe at T=2\n\nNote that for y=3 and y=4, unsafe only at T=0, but at T=0, player is at y=0, not on these freeways, so effectively, for player moving, y=3 and y=4 are always safe for T>=1.\n\nSimilarly, for y=5, unsafe at T=0,1,8,9. But T=0 and T=1 might be relevant if player is there early.\n\nPlayer starts at T=0, y=0.\n\nWe need to go from y=0 to y=9 over turns.\n\nLet me denote the turn when player is at y position.\n\nLet t be the turn number.\n\nAt turn t, player has position y_t, and must not be on unsafe (y,t) for y=1 to 8.\n\ny_t changes based on actions.\n\nStart at t=0, y=0.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at some turn H, with y_H=9.\n\nSince y=9 safe always.\n\nMinimal H: at least 9, since from 0 to 9, 9 steps.\n\nBut with waits or downs, might be more.\n\nNow, unsafe times:\n\n- y=1: unsafe only at t=1\n\n- y=2: unsafe at t=6,7,8\n\n- y=3: unsafe at t=0, but t=0 player not there, so safe for t>=1\n\n- y=4: similarly, safe for t>=1\n\n- y=5: unsafe at t=0,1,8,9\n\n- y=6: unsafe at t=2\n\n- y=7: unsafe at t=2\n\n- y=8: unsafe at t=2\n\nAlso, for y=5, unsafe at t=8,9.\n\nNow, player must avoid these.\n\nWe need a sequence of actions to go from y=0 to y=9.\n\nEach action: U, D, S, changing y by +1, -1, 0.\n\ny must be in 0 to 9.\n\nStart: t=0, y=0.\n\nAt t=0, we choose action for y_{1}.\n\nThe action at turn t determines y_{t+1}.\n\nAt turn t, we choose a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, with Δy based on a_t.\n\nThen at turn t+1, position is (0, y_{t+1}), and we check if on freeway, i.e., if y_{t+1} between 1-8, and if unsafe at that turn.\n\nCollision at turn T if at that turn, y_T between 1-8 and unsafe for that y at T.\n\nFor turn T, we are at position y_T, and we check for that y_T and T.\n\nIn terms of when we are on a freeway.\n\nNow, to reach y=9 quickly.\n\nIdeal: go up every turn, but check if any collision.\n\nIf we go up each turn, starting from t=0 y=0.\n\nAfter action at t=0: if U, y_1=1\n\nAt t=1, y=1, which is freeway 1, and unsafe at t=1, so collision if we are at y=1 at t=1.\n\nSo cannot go directly to y=1 at t=1.\n\nIf at t=0 we do S, then y_1=0, still at start.\n\nThen at t=1, if we go U to y=1, but y=1 unsafe only at t=1, so at t=1, if y=1, collision.\n\nSo we cannot be at y=1 at turn t=1.\n\nSimilarly, cannot be at y=1 at t=1.\n\nSo must avoid being at y=1 at turn 1.\n\nTherefore, we need to either stay at y=0 longer or go to y=2 directly but we can only change by 1 per turn, so cannot skip levels.\n\nMust pass through each y sequentially, but can stay or move down.\n\nAt t=0, y=0.\n\nOptions: U, D, or S.\n\nD: down to y=-1, but y must be >=0, so y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, and y in [0,9], so if y=0 and D, y= -1 not allowed, I assume the position is clipped or invalid?\n\nThe player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, and y_{t+1} must be in [0,9], so if y_t=0 and D, y_{t+1} = -1 not in [0,9], so probably not allowed, or we must choose action such that y remains in bounds.\n\nSimilarly, at y=9, cannot go up.\n\nSo actions must be chosen so that y stays within 0 to 9.\n\nAt y=0, possible actions: U or S (since D would go below)\n\nSimilarly, at y=9, D or S.\n\nAt y=0, we can do S or U.\n\nIf U at t=0, y_1=1 at t=1, but y=1 unsafe at t=1, collision.\n\nIf S at t=0, y_1=0 at t=1.\n\nThen at t=1, y=0.\n\nNow at t=1, we can choose action for y_2.\n\nIf U, y_2=1 at t=2.\n\nNow at t=2, y=1, is it safe? y=1 unsafe only at t=1, so at t=2, it should be safe.\n\nSimilarly, if we go to y=1 at t=2, no car, safe.\n\nThen from there, we can go up.\n\nBut we have to check other levels.\n\nAlso, y=6,7,8 unsafe at t=2.\n\nLet's plan the path.\n\nWe need to avoid:\n\n- Being at y=1 at t=1\n\n- Being at y=2 at t=6,7,8\n\n- Being at y=5 at t=0,1,8,9 → but t=0,1 player at y=0, so for y=5, avoid at t=8,9\n\n- Being at y=6 at t=2\n\n- Being at y=7 at t=2\n\n- Being at y=8 at t=2\n\ny=3 and y=4 safe at all times except t=0, but t=0 not relevant.\n\nNow, since we start at t=0 y=0, and want to reach y=9.\n\nMinimal H: if no obstacles, 9 turns to go from 0 to 9.\n\nBut with obstacles, we need to delay or adjust timing.\n\nSpecifically, for y=1, we cannot be there at t=1, but can at other times.\n\nSimilarly, for y=6,7,8, we cannot be there at t=2, but can at other times.\n\nFor y=2, cannot be at t=6,7,8.\n\nFor y=5, cannot be at t=8,9.\n\nNow, let's see possible times to be at each level.\n\nSince we must go through each y from 0 to 9, but we can stay or move down to waste time.\n\nTo minimize turns, we should avoid unnecessary waits.\n\nNow, the critical points: we need to pass y=6,7,8 not at t=2.\n\nSimilarly, pass y=1 not at t=1.\n\nPass y=5 not at t=8,9.\n\nPass y=2 not at t=6,7,8.\n\nNow, t=2 is bad for y=6,7,8.\n\nIf we go directly, at t=0: y=0\n\nt=1: if U, y=1 but unsafe, not possible.\n\nSo must not go to y=1 at t=1.\n\nThus, at t=0, we cannot do U; must do S, so y_1=0 at t=1.\n\nAt t=1, y=0.\n\nNow, we can do U at t=1 to go to y=1 at t=2.\n\nAt t=2, y=1, which is safe, since unsafe only at t=1.\n\nThen at t=2, we are at y=1.\n\nNow, we want to go to y=2.\n\nBut y=2 is unsafe at t=6,7,8, but t=2 is not in that, so we can go to y=2 at t=3, for example.\n\nLet's sequence.\n\nAt t=2, y=1.\n\nWe can do U to go to y=2 at t=3.\n\nAt t=3, y=2, which is safe since t=3 not 6,7,8.\n\nThen from here, we can continue up.\n\nBut we have to reach y=9, but need to avoid being at y=6,7,8 at t=2, but t=2 is past.\n\nt=2 was when we were at y=1.\n\nNow, from y=2 at t=3, we can go to y=3 at t=4, and so on.\n\nBut let's see the timing.\n\nSuppose we go up each turn from now:\n\nt=0: y=0, action S? At t=0, we do action, which affects y_{t+1}.\n\nTurn t: at beginning, position y_t, then choose action a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy\n\nThen at turn t+1, position y_{t+1}, and we check collision based on y_{t+1} and turn t+1.\n\nIn terms of collision: at turn T, position y_T, so for each turn T, we have y_T.\n\nFor T=0: y_0=0, not on freeway, safe.\n\nAction a_0: if U, then y_1=1 at T=1, which is unsafe for y=1.\n\nIf S, y_1=0 at T=1.\n\nWe did S at t=0, so y_1=0 at turn 1.\n\nNow at turn 1, position y_1=0, safe (not freeway).\n\nAction a_1: if U, then y_2=1 at turn 2.\n\nAt turn 2, y_2=1, which is freeway 1, and unsafe only at t=1, not t=2, so safe.\n\nIf we do U at t=1, y_2=1 at t=2, safe.\n\nThen at turn 2, position y_2=1.\n\nAction a_2: if U, then y_3=2 at turn 3.\n\nAt turn 3, y_3=2, which is freeway 2, and unsafe at t=6,7,8, t=3 not, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, continue: a_2=U, y_3=2 at t=3.\n\nAt t=3, y=2, action a_3=U, y_4=3 at t=4.\n\ny=3 at t=4: safe, as y=3 unsafe only at t=0.\n\na_4=U, y_5=4 at t=5.\n\ny=4 at t=5: safe.\n\na_5=U, y_6=5 at t=6.\n\ny=5 at t=6: is it safe? y=5 unsafe at t=0,1,8,9. t=6 not, so safe? t=6 not in {0,1,8,9}, so yes safe.\n\nBut t=6 is unsafe for y=2, but here y=5, different.\n\ny=5 at t=6: not unsafe time, so safe.\n\nThen a_6=U, y_7=6 at t=7.\n\ny=6 at t=7: is it safe? y=6 unsafe at t=2, not t=7, so should be safe.\n\nSimilarly, a_7=U, y_8=7 at t=8.\n\ny=7 at t=8: unsafe? y=7 unsafe at t=2, not t=8, so safe.\n\nBut y=7 unsafe only at t=2, so t=8 safe.\n\na_8=U, y_9=8 at t=9.\n\ny=8 at t=9: unsafe? y=8 unsafe at t=2, not t=9, so safe.\n\nThen a_9=U, y_10=9 at t=10.\n\nNow, at t=10, y=9, reached.\n\nBut H is the number of turns? We started from t=0 to t=10, with actions from t=0 to t=9? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence: we have actions from t=0 to t=9, H=10 actions? Turns from 0 to 9, 10 turns? No.\n\nt=0: position y_0=0\n\nAfter H actions, we reach at turn t_1 + H -1? Let's see the definition.\n\nThe sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, so t from 0 to H-1.\n\nAfter all actions, position at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nSet t_1 =0.\n\nActions a_t for t=0 to H-1, then position at turn t=H-1? Let's see.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t.\n\nAfter action at turn t, we go to turn t+1 with y_{t+1}.\n\nSo after H actions, we have performed actions at turns t=0 to t=H-1, and position is at turn H.\n\nFor example, start turn 0, after 0 actions, position at turn 0.\n\nAfter 1 action (at t=0), position at turn 1.\n\nAfter H actions (at t=0 to H-1), position at turn H.\n\nWe want position at turn t_final to be (0,9), and t_final = t_1 + H -1? Since t_1=0, t_final = H-1? Inconsistency.\n\nRead carefully.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1\"\n\nYes: the actions are applied from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, and we reach at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nWith t_1=0, actions from turn 0 to turn H-1, reach at turn H-1? No.\n\nSequence {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, so a_t for t from t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nThen position at turn (t_1 + H -1) is (0,9).\n\nFor t_1=0, actions a_t for t=0 to H-1, reach at turn t=H-1.\n\nStart at turn 0, position (0,0).\n\nAfter actions a_0 to a_{H-1}, we have positions from y_0 to y_H, but at turn k, position y_k.\n\nAfter action at turn k, we have y_{k+1}.\n\nAt turn 0, before any action, position y_0.\n\nAfter choosing a_0, we move to y_1 at turn 1.\n\nSimilarly, after a_{k}, we move to y_{k+1} at turn k+1.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t.\n\nWe reach (0,9) at turn T, for some T.\n\nThe actions are chosen from turn 0 to turn T-1, since at turn T-1, we choose a_{T-1} to go to y_T=9.\n\nThen H is the number of actions, which is T, since from turn 0 to T-1, T actions.\n\nReach at turn T, with T actions from 0 to T-1.\n\nIn the sequence, actions {a_t} for t=0 to H-1, reach at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nWith t_1=0, reach at turn H-1.\n\nFor example, if H=1, actions a_0, reach at turn 0? But at turn 0 we start, if we do nothing, but we must perform actions.\n\nIf we do an action at turn 0, we reach turn 1.\n\nMinimal to reach y=9: from y=0, need at least 9 actions to increase to 9, reach at turn 9.\n\nWith actions a_0 to a_8, reach y_9=9 at turn 9.\n\nH=9 actions, reach at turn 8? Let's clarify.\n\nSet t_1=0.\n\nWe need to reach at turn t_1 + H -1 = H-1.\n\nPosition at turn H-1 is (0,9).\n\nAt turn 0, position (0,0).\n\nThe actions are from t=0 to t=H-2? No.\n\nSequence {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, so a_0, a_1, ..., a_{H-1}\n\nThen after these actions, at turn t_1 + H -1 = H-1, position (0,9).\n\nAt turn 0, position is given, before actions.\n\nAfter action a_0, at turn 1, position y_1.\n\nAfter action a_{H-1}, at turn H, position y_H, but we want at turn H-1 position (0,9).\n\nInconsistency.\n\nI think I have a confusion.\n\nRead: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1\"\n\nAt turn t_1 + H -1, position is (0,9).\n\nThe actions are applied at turns t_1, t_1+1, ..., t_1+H-1.\n\nFor example, at turn t_1, we apply a_{t_1}, which determines y_{t_1 +1}.\n\nSimilarly, at turn t_1 + k, apply a_{t_1 + k}, go to y_{t_1 + k +1}.\n\nThen at turn t_1 + H -1, we apply a_{t_1 + H -1}, which should set y_{t_1 + H} =9? No.\n\nAt turn t_1 + H -1, position is y_{t_1 + H -1}, and we want this to be 9.\n\nAfter applying a_{t_1 + H -1}, we go to y_{t_1 + H}, but we don't care about that.\n\nFor turn t_1 + H -1, position is before action or after?\n\nLet's see the player update.\n\n\"Player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\"\n\nAt turn t, we are at y_t, then choose a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy.\n\nSo at turn t, position y_t is given, then we choose a_t, then move to y_{t+1} for turn t+1.\n\nFor collision at turn t: based on y_t and t.\n\nWe want at some turn T, y_T =9.\n\nT = t_1 + H -1.\n\nActions from turn t_1 to t_1 + H -1: a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1}, which affect y_{t_1 +1} to y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nBut y_{t_1 + H} is not the position at turn T, since T = t_1 + H -1.\n\nPosition at turn T = t_1 + H -1 is y_{t_1 + H -1}, which is determined by actions up to a_{t_1 + H -2}, not a_{t_1 + H -1}.\n\nFor example, t_1=0.\n\nPosition at turn 0: y_0.\n\nAction a_0 at turn 0, sets y_1.\n\nAction a_1 at turn 1, sets y_2.\n\n...\n\nAction a_{H-1} at turn H-1, sets y_H.\n\nPosition at turn k is y_k.\n\nWe want y_T =9 with T = t_1 + H -1 = H-1.\n\nSo y_{H-1} =9.\n\ny_{H-1} is set by action a_{H-2} at turn H-2, to go from y_{H-2} to y_{H-1} =9.\n\nThen at turn H-1, position is y_{H-1}=9, and we apply a_{H-1}, which sets y_H, but we don't care about y_H, as long as at turn H-1 we are at 9.\n\nThe actions include a_{H-1} at turn H-1, but it doesn't affect the position at turn H-1, only future.\n\nFor the purpose, we can choose a_{H-1} arbitrarily, since we already reached.\n\nBut in the sequence, we need to specify actions up to a_{H-1}.\n\nNow back to the path.\n\nIn my earlier plan, I had:\n\nt=0: y=0, we did S, so a_0=S, then y_1=0 at turn 1.\n\nt=1: y=0, we do U, a_1=U, then y_2=1 at turn 2.\n\nt=2: y=1, we do U, a_2=U, then y_3=2 at turn 3.\n\nt=3: y=2, do U, a_3=U, y_4=3 at turn 4.\n\nt=4: y=3, do U, a_4=U, y_5=4 at turn 5.\n\nt=5: y=4, do U, a_5=U, y_6=5 at turn 6.\n\nt=6: y=5, do U, a_6=U, y_7=6 at turn 7.\n\nt=7: y=6, do U, a_7=U, y_8=7 at turn 8.\n\nt=8: y=7, do U, a_8=U, y_9=8 at turn 9.\n\nt=9: y=8, do U, a_9=U, y_10=9 at turn 10.\n\nBut we reach at turn 10, y_10=9, but we want to reach at some turn T with y_T=9.\n\nIn this case, at turn 9, y_9=8, not 9.\n\nWe reach y=9 at turn 10.\n\nNow, for H, T = t_1 + H -1 = H-1 since t_1=0.\n\nWe want y_{H-1} =9.\n\nHere, if we reach at turn 10, y_10=9, so T=10, so H-1=10, H=11.\n\nActions from t=0 to t=10? a_0 to a_{10}, but that's 11 actions, reach at turn 11? Messy.\n\nSet T such that y_T=9.\n\nThen actions from turn 0 to turn T-1, a_0 to a_{T-1}, to set y_1 to y_T.\n\ny_T=9.\n\nNumber of actions H = T.\n\nSince actions from 0 to T-1, T actions.\n\nThen T = t_1 + H -1, but t_1=0, so T = H -1, so H = T+1.\n\nFor example, if we reach at turn 1 with y_1=9, then actions: at turn 0, a_0 such that y_1=9, but from y_0=0, impossible in one step, so min T=9, y_9=9.\n\nThen actions a_0 to a_8, 9 actions.\n\nH=9 actions, reach at turn t_1 + H -1 = 0 +9 -1 =8? But turn 8, y_8 should be 9.\n\nIf y_9=9, it is at turn 9.\n\nt_1 + H -1 = 0 +9 -1=8, but we want position at turn 8 to be 9, but in min time, at turn 8 y_8=8 if we go up, not 9.\n\nTo have y_8=9, we need to reach earlier, but from 0 to 9 in 8 steps? 9 levels, min 8 actions to go from 0 to 9? Start y0=0, after first action y1, after k actions y_k.\n\nAfter 8 actions, y8, which can be 8 if all U, or less.\n\nTo have y8=9, we need to have increased by 9 in 8 steps, impossible since max increase 1 per step, so y8 <=8.\n\nThus, earliest to reach y=9 is at turn 9, with y9=9.\n\nThen T=9, so t_1 + H -1 =9, t_1=0, so H-1=9, H=10.\n\nActions from t=0 to t=9, a0 to a9, 10 actions, reach at turn 9.\n\nSimilarly, in general, to reach at turn T, need H = T+1 actions from 0 to T.\n\nWith t_1=0, reach at turn T, actions from 0 to T, H=T+1.\n\nThen T = t_1 + H -1 = H-1.\n\nSo for T=9, H=10.\n\nIn my sequence, I have y9=8 at turn 9, then a9=U to y10=9 at turn 10, so T=10, H=11.\n\nBut we can reach faster.\n\nIn the sequence above, at t=5, y5=4, then a5=U, y6=5 at t=6.\n\nBut we can go faster from the beginning.\n\nSince we wasted one turn at start.\n\nAt t=0, instead of S, we could do something else, but we cannot do U because of collision at t=1 y=1.\n\nSo must start with S or D, but D not possible, so S.\n\nThen at t=1, y=0, do U to y=1 at t=2.\n\nBut at t=2, we could go directly to y=2, but we can only change by 1, so at t=2, from y=1, we can go to y=2 at t=3.\n\nNo way to skip.\n\nAnother idea: go down at some point to waste time, but that might take more turns.\n\nFor example, to avoid y=6,7,8 at t=2, but in the above, we are at y=6 at t=7, which is fine.\n\nBut we have a problem with y=5 at t=8 or 9.\n\nIn the sequence, at t=6, y6=5 at turn 6, which is safe.\n\nThen a6=U, y7=6 at t=7.\n\nt=7 y=6, safe.\n\na7=U, y8=7 at t=8.\n\ny=7 at t=8, safe? y=7 unsafe only at t=2, so t=8 safe, yes.\n\na8=U, y9=8 at t=9.\n\ny=8 at t=9, safe? y=8 unsafe at t=2, not t=9, safe.\n\nThen a9=U, y10=9 at t=10.\n\nBut at turn 9, y9=8, not 9.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 earlier or later.\n\nBut min at turn 9.\n\nTo reach at turn 9, y9=9.\n\nFrom y0=0, we need to increase by 9 in 9 steps, so all U, but we cannot because of collision at t=1.\n\nSpecifically, to have y9=9, we must have done U each turn from some point, but from t=0 to t=8, actions a0 to a8, setting y1 to y9.\n\ny1 = y0 + Δy0, etc.\n\nTo have y9=9, since y0=0, we need sum of Δy from t=0 to 8 to be +9, each Δy <=1, so must be all U, so y1=1, y2=2, ..., y9=9.\n\nBut then at t=1, y1=1, which is unsafe, collision.\n\nImpossible to reach at turn 9 with y9=9 directly because of that.\n\nMust take at least 10 turns to reach, so T=10, y10=9.\n\nThen H=11 actions? Reach at turn T=10, so t_1 + H -1 =10, t_1=0, H-1=10, H=11.\n\nActions from 0 to 10.\n\nIn the sequence I have, with one S at start, we reach at turn 10.\n\nBut we can reach at turn 10 with y10=9.\n\nNow, in that sequence, we have y=5 at t=6, which is fine, but we also have to avoid y=5 at t=8,9, but in the sequence, y5 is at t=5? Let's list positions:\n\nt=0: y=0\n\nt=1: y=0 (after a0=S)\n\nt=2: y=1 (after a1=U)\n\nt=3: y=2 (a2=U)\n\nt=4: y=3 (a3=U)\n\nt=5: y=4 (a4=U)\n\nt=6: y=5 (a5=U)\n\nt=7: y=6 (a6=U)\n\nt=8: y=7 (a7=U)\n\nt=9: y=8 (a8=U)\n\nt=10: y=9 (a9=U)\n\nNow, check collisions:\n\nAt t=1: y=0, not freeway, safe.\n\nt=2: y=1, freeway 1, unsafe at t=1 only, not t=2, safe.\n\nt=3: y=2, freeway 2, unsafe at t=6,7,8, t=3 not, safe.\n\nt=4: y=3, freeway 3, unsafe only at t=0, not t=4, safe.\n\nt=5: y=4, freeway 4, similar, safe.\n\nt=6: y=5, freeway 5, unsafe at t=0,1,8,9. t=6 not, safe.\n\nt=7: y=6, freeway 6, unsafe at t=2, not t=7, safe.\n\nt=8: y=7, freeway 7, unsafe at t=2, not t=8, safe.\n\nt=9: y=8, freeway 8, unsafe at t=2, not t=9, safe.\n\nt=10: y=9, no freeway, safe.\n\nAll safe, and we reached at turn 10.\n\nBut is this minimal H? H=11 actions? Actions from t=0 to t=10, 11 actions, reach at turn 10.\n\nSince we must take at least 9 steps up, and we have one stay, so 10 actions to reach turn 10, but number of actions is 10 for a0 to a9? t=0 to t=9, 10 actions, reach at turn 10.\n\nH=10 actions.\n\nReach at turn t_1 + H -1 = 0 +10 -1=9? Turn 9.\n\nBut in this case, at turn 9, y9=8, not 9.\n\nI think I need to accept that with the collision constraint, we cannot reach before turn 10.\n\nPerhaps we can reach at turn 10 with fewer actions, but we have to take 9 up actions and at least one extra action to avoid the collision, so min 10 actions to reach turn 10 with y10=9.\n\nWith 10 actions, we can reach at turn 10.\n\nIn the sequence above, with actions: a0=S, a1=U, a2=U, ..., a9=U, so 10 actions, y10=9.\n\nBut a0 to a9 is 10 actions, turn from 0 to 9.\n\nAfter a9 at turn 9, y10=9 at turn 10.\n\nPosition at turn 10 is y10=9.\n\nNow, t_1 + H -1 = 0 +10 -1=9, but we are at turn 10, which is not turn 9.\n\nInconsistency with the definition.\n\nTo resolve: we want position at turn T=10 to be 9.\n\nThen T = t_1 + H -1 = H-1, so H-1=10, H=11.\n\nActions a_t for t=0 to 10, a0 to a10.\n\nBut a10 at turn 10 sets y11, not needed.\n\nBut in the sequence, we can set a10 arbitrarily, say S.\n\nThen actions: a0 to a10.\n\nBut for the path, a0 to a9 as above, then a10=S or something.\n\nBut position at turn 10 is set before a10.\n\nAt turn 10, position y10, then we choose a10.\n\nWe want y10=9.\n\nSo with a0 to a9 as above, y10=9.\n\nThen at turn 10, y10=9, we can choose a10, say S, to stay.\n\nThen actions from t=0 to t=10, H=11 actions, reach at turn 10 = t_1 + H -1 =0+11-1=10.\n\nYes.\n\nH=11.\n\nBut in the sequence, we have one stay at t=0, and 9 up, total 10 actions to reach, but with 10 actions a0 to a9, we reach y10=9 at turn 10, then we need to include a10 for the action at turn 10.\n\nSince the action at turn 10 doesn't affect position at turn 10, we can add it.\n\nTo minimize H, but H is the number of turns for actions, but since we reach at turn 10, and actions up to turn 10, H=11.\n\nPerhaps we can reach earlier with different path.\n\nFor example, avoid the stay at start by going down, but not possible.\n\nOr, for later times, to avoid y=5 at t=8 or 9.\n\nIn the current path, we are not at y=5 at t=8 or 9; at t=8 y=7, t=9 y=8.\n\ny=5 at t=6, safe.\n\nBut we have to pass y=2 at some point, and y=2 unsafe at t=6,7,8.\n\nIn current path, at t=3, y=2, which is not 6,7,8, safe.\n\nIs there a way to reach faster?\n\nSuppose we do not stay at start, but we must, because of y=1 at t=1.\n\nPerhaps we can stay later or something, but that might take more time.\n\nFor example, to avoid y=2 at t=6,7,8, but in min path, we pass y=2 early.\n\nAnother constraint: y=6,7,8 unsafe at t=2, but we pass them late.\n\nBut in this case, we reached in 10 turns from start position to y=9.\n\nTurn 0 to turn 10, 11 turns? Positions from turn 0 to turn 10, but turns are 11 points.\n\nNumber of turns from start to end.\n\nSince we start at turn 0, end at turn 10, it took 10 steps.\n\nBut with H actions, we cover H steps.\n\nI think H=10 is minimal for this path.\n\nBut let's confirm if we can reach at turn 9.\n\nAs before, impossible because y1=1 must be at t=1 which is unsafe, and we cannot be at y=1 at t=1, but to reach y9=9 at turn 9, we must have y1=1 at t=1, collision.\n\nSo indeed, min turn to reach is 10.\n\nWith y10=9.\n\nH=11 actions from t=0 to t=10.\n\nBut for the sequence, we need actions for t=0 to H-1.\n\nIn the answer format, we list actions starting from turn t_1.\n\nNow, back to the car on y=2, at t=6,7,8 unsafe, but in our path, we are not there.\n\ny=5 at t=8,9 unsafe, but we are at y=7 and 8, not y=5.\n\nIn t=8, y=7, which is safe.\n\nBut is there any other issue?\n\nFreeway 2 has cars, but we are at y=2 at t=3, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nBut we have a car on freeway 5 that is unsafe at t=8,9, but we are not on y=5 at that time.\n\nIn the sequence, at t=6, y=5, but t=6 not unsafe.\n\nt=8,9 unsafe for y=5, but y=5 not at t=8,9.\n\nIn t=8, y=7, etc.\n\nSo the path seems safe.\n\nCan we save a turn?\n\nFor example, if we could go faster, but we have to avoid the collision at t=1.\n\nSuppose at t=0, we do U, but then at t=1 y=1, collision, not possible.\n\nOr, do D, but y cannot go below 0, so invalid.\n\nSo must do S at t=0.\n\nThen proceed up.\n\nPerhaps at some point we can move faster, but we are going up each turn after.\n\nBut we have to pass through all y, so no.\n\nAnother idea: since y=3 and y=4 are always safe after t=0, and y=5 safe except t=0,1,8,9, we could stay at y=4 or something to avoid later issues, but in this case, no need, since we don't have issues.\n\nFor example, if we were to be at y=5 at t=8, we need to avoid, but in min time, we pass early.\n\nSo current path should be minimal, with H=11 actions? Let's count.\n\nActions: from t=0 to t=10, 11 actions.\n\nBut to reach at turn 10, with y10=9, we need 10 actions: a0 to a9, with a0=S, a1 to a9=U.\n\nThen y1=0, y2=1, y3=2, ..., y10=9.\n\nPositions: t=0: y=0, t=1: y=0, t=2: y=1, t=3: y=2, t=4: y=3, t=5: y=4, t=6: y=5, t=7: y=6, t=8: y=7, t=9: y=8, t=10: y=9.\n\nNow, for actions, we have a0 to a9.\n\nH should be such that actions from t=0 to H-1, and reach at turn H-1.\n\nBut here with a0 to a9, 10 actions, reach at turn 10, but turn 10 = H-1? 10 = H-1, H=11.\n\nThen actions from t=0 to 10, a0 to a10.\n\nBut a10 is at turn 10, which sets y11, but y10 is already 9, so we need to include an action for turn 10.\n\nFor example, set a10=S.\n\nThen the sequence has 11 actions.\n\nBut in practice, since we reach at turn 10, and action at turn 10 doesn't matter, but we have to specify.\n\nIn the answer, we list actions for each turn starting from t_1.\n\nNow for the car on freeway 3 and 4, at t=0 unsafe, but we not there.\n\nIn this path, at t=6, y=5, and freeway 5 has cars, but at t=6, is it safe?\n\nFreeway 5: unsafe at t=0,1,8,9.\n\nt=6 not, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, all others.\n\nBut freeway 2: at t=3, y=2.\n\nFreeway 2 unsafe at t=6,7,8.\n\nt=3 not, so safe.\n\nThe car on y=2 at t=6,7,8: the third car covers x=0.\n\nBut at t=3, not covered.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo this should work.\n\nNow, minimal H: since we have one wait, min actions 10 to reach y=9 from start, but with 10 actions a0 to a9, we reach turn 10, so H=10 for actions, but reach at turn 10, while t_1 + H -1 =0+10-1=9, not 10.\n\nTo have reach at turn 10, we need t_1 + H -1 =10, so H-1=10, H=11.\n\nThus, actions from t=0 to 10.\n\nSequence: a0=S, a1=U, a2=U, a3=U, a4=U, a5=U, a6=U, a7=U, a8=U, a9=U, a10=S (or anything).\n\nBut a10 can be S, to stay at y=9.\n\nIn the action sequence for t=0 to H-1.\n\nH=11.\n\nBut let's see if we can have fewer actions by reaching earlier, but cannot.\n\nPerhaps we can reach at turn 10 with only 10 actions, but the definition requires actions up to the reach turn.\n\nAnother point: in the beginning, at turn t=0, position is given, we don't need an action to be there, but we choose action to move to next.\n\nSimilarly, at the end, when we reach, we may have extra action.\n\nBut in min H, since we must have the actions to move, min H is 10 for this path.\n\nBut to satisfy the reach turn, we set H=11.\n\nPerhaps for y=5, at t=8,9 unsafe, but in our path we avoid.\n\nBut is there a need to adjust for other things?\n\nFreeway 6,7,8 unsafe at t=2, but we pass at t=7,8,9, which is late.\n\nBut no problem.\n\nPerhaps we can go faster by not staying at t=0, but impossible.\n\nOr, go down to y=0 and wait more, but that would take more turns, worse.\n\nSo this seems minimal.\n\nBut let's list the actions:\n\nTurn 0: S\n\nThen position at t=1: y=0\n\nTurn 1: U\n\nt=2: y=1\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nt=3: y=2\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nt=4: y=3\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nt=5: y=4\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nt=6: y=5\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nt=7: y=6\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nt=8: y=7\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nt=9: y=8\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nt=10: y=9\n\nNow, we are at t=10, y=9.\n\nFor actions, from turn 0 to turn 9, we have specified a0 to a9.\n\nAt turn 10, we need to specify a10 for the sequence if H=11.\n\nSince the position at turn 10 is already 9, we can choose any action, say S.\n\nSo the sequence of actions: for t from 0 to 10.\n\nIn the answer, we list for turn t_1, t_1+1, ..., up to the actions.\n\nNow, for the car state, I think we covered all.\n\nBut in freeway 2, there is a car at (12,1,right,4), but we are at y=2 at t=3, not at unsafe times.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think this is correct.\n\nMinimal H=11.\n\nBut H is the number of turns, meaning number of actions.\n\nIn the sequence, 11 actions.\n\nTo write the answer.\n\nBut in the initial, t_1 is given as current turn, which is 0.\n\nSo actions from turn 0 to turn 10.\n\nBut turn 10 is t_1 + 10.\n\nt_1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nH=11, t from 0 to 10.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 0: S\n\nTurn 1: U\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: S\n\nBut for turn 10, action can be S, since we are at y=9.\n\nIn the sequence, the last action is at turn 10, which sets y11, but we don't care.\n\nNow, to confirm, at turn 10, position is y10=9, which is reached.\n\nPerhaps we can stop at turn 9 with y9=9, but impossible as established.\n\nSo I think this is minimal.\n\nBut in the sequence, we have 11 actions, but the first action is at turn 0, and we reach at turn 10.\n\nNow, for the answer format.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 0: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 1: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 2: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 3: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 4: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 5: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: S \\end{array} }\n\nBut for turn 10, S is fine.\n\nSince the action at turn 10 doesn't affect reaching (0,9) at turn 10, we can choose U or D, but y=9, if U, y11=10>9 not allowed, so must do S or D, but D to y=8 not good, so S is safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nI think this works.\n\nBut let's make sure about the car on freeway 5.\n\nAt t=6, y=5.\n\nFreeway 5 cars: first car (-48,-59,right,6), at T, span [-59+6T, -48+6T]\n\nAt t=6: -59+36= -23, -48+36= -12, so [-23,-12], not cover 0.\n\nSecond car (0,-11,right,6), at T, span [-11+6T, 6T]\n\nAt t=6: -11+36=25, 36, so [25,36], not cover 0.\n\nSo safe.\n\nOther turns similar.\n\nSo yes.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=11, and the sequence as above.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 0\\) is 11. This sequence avoids collisions with all cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) based on the given car states and game dynamics.\n\nThe actions are chosen as follows:\n- At turn 0, the player stays (S) to avoid moving to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 1, where freeway \\(y = 1\\) is unsafe due to a car collision.\n- From turn 1 to turn 9, the player moves up (U) each turn to incrementally increase the \\(y\\)-position from 0 to 9.\n- At turn 10, the player stays (S) to remain at \\(y = 9\\), as the goal is reached at turn 10.\n\nThe sequence ensures that the player is never on an unsafe freeway at an unsafe turn:\n- \\(y = 1\\) is unsafe only at turn 1; the player is at \\(y = 1\\) at turn 2, which is safe.\n- \\(y = 2\\) is unsafe at turns 6, 7, 8; the player is at \\(y = 2\\) at turn 3, which is safe.\n- \\(y = 3\\) is unsafe only at turn 0; the player is at \\(y = 3\\) at turn 4, which is safe.\n- \\(y = 4\\) is unsafe only at turn 0; the player is at \\(y = 4\\) at turn 5, which is safe.\n- \\(y = 5\\) is unsafe at turns 0, 1, 8, 9; the player is at \\(y = 5\\) at turn 6, which is safe.\n- \\(y = 6\\) is unsafe only at turn 2; the player is at \\(y = 6\\) at turn 7, which is safe.\n- \\(y = 7\\) is unsafe only at turn 2; the player is at \\(y = 7\\) at turn 8, which is safe.\n- \\(y = 8\\) is unsafe only at turn 2; the player is at \\(y = 8\\) at turn 9, which is safe.\n\nThe position \\((0, 9)\\) is reached at turn 10, and no collisions occur during the sequence.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 0: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 1: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 2: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 3: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 4: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 5: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: S \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at (0, 0) at turn t_1 = 1. The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. The player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing the y-position by +1, -1, or 0, respectively, but y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if the player is on a freeway y_T and for that freeway, there's a car such that 0 is in its span at that turn. The span changes over time based on the car's direction and speed.\n\nI need to find a sequence of actions from turn 1 to some turn H where y_H = 9, and no collision happens at any turn.\n\nThe car states are given for turn t_1=1. For each freeway, there are cars with their positions and movements.\n\nLet me list out the cars for each freeway at turn 1:\n\n- Freeway 1: one car, head at 0, tail at -47, direction right, speed 48. Since it's right-moving, the span is [τ, h] = [-47, 0]. Direction right means it's moving to the right, so span increases.\n\nCar update: for right-moving, span at time T is [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nSimilarly for left-moving: [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nIn the collision rule, it says: collision if 0 ∈ Span(T) for the freeway y_T.\n\nAnd note: when you move to a new y, you are not on that freeway until the next turn. So if at turn T, you are on y_T, and you move to y_{T+1} at turn T, you are not on y_{T+1} until turn T+1, so you don't check collision for y_{T+1} at turn T.\n\nNow, the player starts at y=0, which is not a freeway; freeways are y=1 to 8. y=0 and y=9 are safe, I think, since no cars there. The grid has y from 0 to 9, and freeways with cars are y=1 to 8.\n\nAt turn 1, player is at (0,0). Since y=0 is not a freeway, no collision possible there. Similarly, y=9 is the goal, no cars.\n\nThe player needs to move up through the freeways to reach y=9.\n\nSince we start at y=0 and end at y=9, and we need to go up, but we can also move down or stay, but to minimize turns, we probably want to go up as much as possible, but we have to avoid the cars.\n\nEach action changes y by at most 1, so from y=0 to y=9, minimum H is 9 turns if we go up every time, but we might need to wait or something to avoid cars.\n\nH is the number of turns, so from turn t to t+H-1, actions from t to t+H-2? Let's see the sequence.\n\nThe sequence is {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1}, so actions at times t_1, t_1+1, ..., t_1+H-1.\n\nAfter H actions, at time t_1 + H, the position is y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nStart at turn t_1: position (0, y_{t_1}) = (0,0)\n\nAfter action a_{t_1}, at turn t_1+1, position is (0, y_{t_1+1})\n\n...\n\nAfter action a_{t_1+H-1}, at turn t_1+H, position is (0, y_{t_1+H})\n\nWe want y_{t_1+H} = 9.\n\nAnd for each turn T from t_1 to t_1+H, we need no collision at that turn.\n\nAt turn T, collision depends on y_T and the cars on that row at that time.\n\ny_T is the position at the beginning of turn T, I think.\n\nLet's clarify the timing.\n\nAt the start of turn T, player is at (0, y_T).\n\nThen, during turn T, player chooses action a_T, which determines y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy_T.\n\nThen, at the end of the turn or something? The collision is checked at turn T for position y_T.\n\nFrom the game dynamics:\n\n\"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd y_T is the position at turn T.\n\nAlso, the note says: if you move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you are not on y_{T+1} at turn T, so no collision check for y_{T+1} at turn T.\n\nSo, at turn T, you are on freeway y_T, and you check if there is a car on that freeway such that 0 is in its span at time T.\n\nThen you take action, move to y_{T+1}, and at turn T+1, you are on y_{T+1}, check for that.\n\nNow, for the cars, the span at time T is given based on t_1 and T.\n\nt_1 is given as 1, current turn.\n\nSo for any turn T, we can compute the span for each car.\n\nFirst, let's list all cars and their spans at time T.\n\nSince collision only matters for the row we are on, we only care about cars on the row we are at during that turn.\n\nWe start at turn 1, y=0. Since y=0 is not a freeway, no cars, so no collision possible at turn 1. We can take any action, but probably we want to move up.\n\nSimilarly, when we reach y=9, no cars, so no issue.\n\nNow, the freeways are y=1 to 8, each with cars.\n\nLet me list the cars for each freeway at turn t_1=1.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: head h=0, tail τ=-47, direction right, speed s=48.\n\nSince right-moving, span at time t is [τ + s(t - t_1), h + s(t - t_1)] = [-47 + 48(t-1), 0 + 48(t-1)] for t >=1.\n\nt is the turn number.\n\nt_1=1, so for turn T, span = [-47 + 48(T-1), 48(T-1)] because h + s(T-1) = 0 + 48(T-1)\n\nSimilarly, τ + s(T-1) = -47 + 48(T-1)\n\nSo span = [ -47 + 48(T-1) , 48(T-1) ]\n\nNow, collision if 0 is in this interval, i.e., -47 +48(T-1) <= 0 <= 48(T-1)\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFreeway 2: three cars.\n\nFirst car: (52, 41, right, 4) — head=52, tail=41? But for right-moving, it should be [τ, h], so if head is 52, tail is 41, that means τ=41, h=52? The notation says \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nAnd for right-moving, span is [τ, h] at t_1, and moves to [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nSimilarly for left-moving.\n\nIn freeway 2, all cars are right-moving.\n\nFirst car: h=52, τ=41, d=right, s=4\n\nSo at T, span = [41 + 4(T-1), 52 + 4(T-1)]\n\nSecond car: (16, 5, right, 4) so h=16, τ=5, d=right, s=4\n\nSpan at T: [5 + 4(T-1), 16 + 4(T-1)]\n\nThird car: (-20, -31, right, 4) h=-20, τ=-31, d=right, s=4\n\nSpan at T: [-31 + 4(T-1), -20 + 4(T-1)]\n\nFreeway 3: two cars, both right, s=12\n\nFirst: (60,49,right,12) h=60, τ=49? Head 60, tail 49, so [τ,h] = [49,60] at t_1\n\nAt T: [49 +12(T-1), 60+12(T-1)]\n\nSecond: (12,1,right,12) h=12, τ=1, span at T: [1+12(T-1), 12+12(T-1)]\n\nFreeway 4: same as freeway 3? \" (60,49,right,12), (12,1,right,12) \" identical to freeway 3.\n\nFreeway 5: two cars, both right, s=6\n\nFirst: (-42,-53,right,6) h=-42, τ=-53, span at T: [-53 +6(T-1), -42+6(T-1)]\n\nSecond: (6,-5,right,6) h=6, τ=-5, span at T: [-5 +6(T-1), 6+6(T-1)]\n\nFreeway 6: one car: (24,47,left,24) direction left, so for left-moving, span at t_1 is [h, τ] = [24,47]? Head h=24, tail τ=47, and left-moving, so span is [h, τ] and moves left.\n\nFrom car update: left-moving, span at T: [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nSo here h=24, τ=47, s=24, t_1=1\n\nAt T: [24 - 24(T-1), 47 - 24(T-1)]\n\nFreeway 7: similarly, (24,47,left,24) same as freeway 6.\n\nFreeway 8: (12,47,left,36) h=12, τ=47, d=left, s=36\n\nAt T: [12 - 36(T-1), 47 - 36(T-1)]\n\nNow, the player needs to go from y=0 to y=9.\n\nAt turn 1, y=0, no collision.\n\nWe take action a_1, which affects y_2.\n\nThen at turn 2, y_2, if y_2 between 1 and 8, check collision on that freeway.\n\nSimilarly for subsequent turns.\n\nTo reach y=9 in minimal turns, we want to go up as fast as possible, but avoid being on a freeway when 0 is in a car's span.\n\nSince we can stay or move down, but moving down might not help to reach faster, so probably only move up or stay, but moving down could be used to avoid, but since we need to go up, staying or moving down might increase turns, so for minimal H, we should avoid moving down unless necessary to avoid collision.\n\nSimilarly, staying might be needed to wait.\n\nBut let's see if we can find a path with no waiting.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway and each turn, whether 0 is covered by some car.\n\nBut we need to know when we are on that row.\n\nSince the player moves one step at a time, we can simulate the path.\n\nStart at turn 1, y=0.\n\nAction a1: we can choose U, D, or S.\n\nIf U, y2=1\n\nIf S, y2=0\n\nIf D, y2=0? y=0, if D, y= max(0, y + Δy) = max(0, -1) =0, so y stays 0.\n\nSimilarly, at y=9, U would stay 9.\n\nBut we start at 0, so D or S keeps us at 0, which doesn't help, so we should move up to y=1 as soon as possible.\n\nSimilarly, to reach 9, we need to go through the freeways.\n\nMinimal turns: if no cars, we can go up 9 times in 9 turns: actions U,U,U,...U from t=1 to t=9, then at t=10, y=9.\n\nBut with cars, we might need to delay or something.\n\nSince we can stay, we might need to stay on a row if it's safe, or move to avoid.\n\nBut let's check each freeway for safety at different times.\n\nFirst, freeway y=1.\n\nAt turn T, if player is on y=1, collision if 0 in span of the car on y=1.\n\ny=1 has one car: head 0, tail -47, right, speed 48.\n\nSpan at T: [ -47 + 48(T-1) , 48(T-1) ]\n\n0 in span if -47 +48(T-1) <= 0 <= 48(T-1)\n\nSince 48(T-1) >=0 for T>=1, so 0 <= 48(T-1) always true for T>=1? 48(T-1) >=0 for T>=1, equal at T=1.\n\nAt T=1, span [ -47 +0, 0 ] = [-47,0], so 0 <=0 is true, so 0 is in [ -47,0], yes, closed interval I assume.\n\nSimilarly, 0 <= 48(T-1) is true for T>=1.\n\nNow left inequality: -47 +48(T-1) <=0\n\nSo 48(T-1) <=47\n\nT-1 <= 47/48 <1, so T-1 <=0 since T integer, T-1=0, T=1.\n\nFor T=1, -47 +0 = -47 <=0, true.\n\nFor T>1, -47 +48(T-1) > -47 +48(1) =1? At T=2, -47+48(1)=1>0, so -47+48(T-1) >0 for T>=2, so 0 < lower bound, so 0 not in [lower, upper] since lower >0.\n\nFor T=1: lower = -47 <=0, upper=0, so 0 in [ -47,0]\n\nFor T=2: lower = -47 +48(1) =1, upper=48(1)=48, span [1,48], 0 not in it.\n\nT=3: lower= -47+96=49, upper=96, [49,96], 0 not in.\n\nSo for y=1, collision only at T=1 when on the freeway.\n\nAt T=1, if player is on y=1, but at turn 1, player is at y=0, not on y=1, so no collision at T=1 for y=1.\n\nBut when we move to y=1, we are on y=1 at turn 2 if we go up at turn 1.\n\nLet's see.\n\nAt turn 1: y=0, not freeway, safe. Take action a1.\n\nSuppose a1 = U, then y2 = 0 +1 =1.\n\nNow at turn 2, y=1, which is freeway 1.\n\nNow check collision: at turn 2, for freeway y=1, car span at T=2: as above, [1,48], 0 not in it, so no collision.\n\nSimilarly, for any T>=2, 0 not in span, so y=1 is always safe except at T=1, but T=1 we are not on it.\n\nSo for y=1, it is safe to be on at any turn except possibly T=1, but we can't be on it at T=1 since we start at 0.\n\nSo after turn 1, we can be on y=1 safely.\n\nNow, freeway y=2.\n\ny=2 has three cars.\n\nWe need to see when 0 is in any of their spans at turn T.\n\nFirst car: (52,41,right,4) span at T: [41 +4(T-1), 52+4(T-1)]\n\n0 in this? 41+4(T-1) <=0 <=52+4(T-1)\n\nBut 41+4(T-1) >=41>0 for T>=1, so 0 < lower bound, not possible.\n\nSimilarly, upper bound larger, but lower >0, so 0 not in [lower,upper] since lower >=41>0.\n\nSecond car: (16,5,right,4) span [5+4(T-1), 16+4(T-1)]\n\n0 in this? 5+4(T-1) <=0 <=16+4(T-1)\n\n5+4(T-1) >=5>0 for all T, so always lower >0, 0 not in interval.\n\nThird car: (-20,-31,right,4) span [-31 +4(T-1), -20+4(T-1)]\n\n0 in this: -31+4(T-1) <=0 <= -20+4(T-1)\n\nFirst, 0 <= -20+4(T-1) implies 4(T-1) >=20, T-1 >=5, T>=6\n\nSecond, -31+4(T-1) <=0 implies 4(T-1) <=31, T-1 <=31/4=7.75, so T-1<=7 since integer, T<=8\n\nSo for T=6,7,8\n\nAt T=6: lower = -31+4(5) = -31+20= -11, upper= -20+20=0, so span [-11,0], 0 in it? 0<=0 yes, -11<=0 yes.\n\nAt T=7: lower=-31+24= -7, upper=-20+24=4, span [-7,4], 0 in it.\n\nT=8: lower=-31+28= -3, upper=-20+28=8, span [-3,8], 0 in it.\n\nT=9: lower=-31+32=1, upper=12, span [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo for third car, 0 in span at T=6,7,8.\n\nTherefore, on freeway 2, collision if at turn T, 0 is in any car's span.\n\nFirst two cars never cover 0, only third car covers 0 at T=6,7,8.\n\nSo for y=2, unsafe at T=6,7,8; safe otherwise.\n\nNow freeway y=3.\n\nTwo cars, both right, s=12.\n\nFirst car: (60,49,right,12) span at T: [49+12(T-1), 60+12(T-1)]\n\n49+12(T-1) >=49>0, so 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: (12,1,right,12) span [1+12(T-1), 12+12(T-1)]\n\n1+12(T-1) >=1>0, so always lower >0, 0 not in interval.\n\nSo for y=3, no car covers 0 at any time, so always safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway y=4: same as y=3, cars (60,49,right,12) and (12,1,right,12), both spans have min >=1>0, so 0 never covered, always safe.\n\nNow freeway y=5.\n\nTwo cars, both right, s=6.\n\nFirst car: (-42,-53,right,6) span at T: [-53+6(T-1), -42+6(T-1)]\n\n0 in this: -53+6(T-1) <=0 <= -42+6(T-1)\n\nFirst, 0 <= -42+6(T-1) => 6(T-1) >=42 => T-1>=7 => T>=8\n\nSecond, -53+6(T-1) <=0 => 6(T-1) <=53 => T-1 <=53/6≈8.833, so T-1<=8, T<=9\n\nSo for T=8,9\n\nAt T=8: lower=-53+6(7)= -53+42= -11, upper=-42+42=0, span [-11,0], 0 in it.\n\nT=9: lower=-53+48= -5, upper=-42+48=6, span [-5,6], 0 in it.\n\nT=10: lower=-53+54=1, upper=12, span [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: (6,-5,right,6) span [-5+6(T-1), 6+6(T-1)]\n\n0 in this: -5+6(T-1) <=0 <= 6+6(T-1)\n\n0 <=6+6(T-1) always true for T>=1\n\n-5+6(T-1) <=0 => 6(T-1) <=5 => T-1 <=5/6<1, so T-1=0, T=1\n\nAt T=1: lower=-5+0= -5, upper=6, span [-5,6], 0 in it.\n\nFor T>1, lower = -5+6(T-1) >= -5+6(1)=1>0 at T=2? T=2: lower=-5+6(1)=1, upper=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo for second car, only at T=1, 0 in span.\n\nBut at T=1, we are not on y=5, so when we are on y=5, only the first car matters at T=8,9.\n\nFirst car unsafe at T=8,9; second car unsafe only at T=1, but irrelevant since we can't be on y=5 at T=1.\n\nSo for y=5, unsafe at T=8,9; safe otherwise.\n\nNow freeway y=6.\n\nOne car: (24,47,left,24) left-moving.\n\nSpan at T: [h - s(T-1), τ - s(T-1)] = [24 - 24(T-1), 47 - 24(T-1)]\n\n0 in this: 24 - 24(T-1) <= 0 <= 47 - 24(T-1)\n\nFirst, 0 <= 47 - 24(T-1) => 24(T-1) <=47 => T-1 <=47/24≈1.958, so T-1<=1, T<=2\n\nSecond, 24 - 24(T-1) <=0 => 24 <= 24(T-1) => 1 <= T-1 => T>=2\n\nSo from T>=2 and T<=2, so only at T=2.\n\nAt T=2: lower=24-24(1)=0, upper=47-24(1)=23, span [0,23], 0 in it? 0<=0 yes.\n\nAt T=1: lower=24-0=24, upper=47, [24,47], 0 not in.\n\nT=3: lower=24-48= -24, upper=47-48= -1, span [-24,-1], 0 not in since negative.\n\nSo only at T=2, 0 in span for y=6.\n\nThus, on freeway 6, collision only at T=2.\n\nFreeway y=7: same as y=6, car (24,47,left,24), so identical, unsafe only at T=2.\n\nFreeway y=8: car (12,47,left,36) left-moving.\n\nSpan at T: [12 - 36(T-1), 47 - 36(T-1)]\n\n0 in this: 12 - 36(T-1) <= 0 <= 47 - 36(T-1)\n\nFirst, 0 <= 47 - 36(T-1) => 36(T-1) <=47 => T-1 <=47/36≈1.305, so T-1<=1, T<=2\n\nSecond, 12 - 36(T-1) <=0 => 12 <= 36(T-1) => 1/3 <= T-1 => T-1 >=1 since integer? T-1 >= ceil(1/3)=1, so T>=2\n\nThus T>=2 and T<=2, so only at T=2.\n\nAt T=2: lower=12-36(1)=12-36= -24, upper=47-36=11, span [-24,11], 0 in it.\n\nAt T=1: lower=12-0=12, upper=47, [12,47], 0 not in.\n\nT=3: lower=12-72= -60, upper=47-72= -25, [-60,-25], 0 not in.\n\nSo y=8 also unsafe only at T=2.\n\nSummary of unsafe times:\n\n- y=1: always safe (since only unsafe at T=1, but not on)\n\n- y=2: unsafe at T=6,7,8\n\n- y=3: always safe\n\n- y=4: always safe\n\n- y=5: unsafe at T=8,9\n\n- y=6: unsafe at T=2\n\n- y=7: unsafe at T=2\n\n- y=8: unsafe at T=2\n\nNow, player starts at turn 1, y=0.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nMinimal H: we need to go from y=0 to y=9, 9 steps up.\n\nBut with constraints on when we can be on certain rows.\n\nThe path: we start at turn 1, y=0.\n\nAfter each action, we move to next y.\n\nThe turn when we are on a row matters.\n\nDefine the sequence.\n\nLet t be the turn number.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t.\n\ny_1 = 0 (given)\n\nAfter action a_t, y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\n\nWe want y_{t} for t from 1 to some H, but y_H =9.\n\ny_t is the position at turn t, and we want for some T, y_T =9, but since we reach at turn T, we need to be at y=9 at that turn.\n\ny_T =9 means at turn T, we are at (0,9), which is safe, no freeway.\n\nThen the last action was at turn T-1, which set y_T=9.\n\nBut in the sequence, actions from t=1 to t=H-1, and y_H=9.\n\nSet.\n\nStart: turn 1, y1=0\n\nAction a1: y2 = y1 + Δy1\n\nAction a2: y3 = y2 + Δy2\n\n...\n\nAction a_{k}: y_{k+1} = y_k + Δy_k\n\nWe want y_{H} =9 for some H.\n\nAnd for each turn t from 1 to H, no collision, meaning if 1<= y_t <=8, then for freeway y_t, 0 not in any car span at time t.\n\ny_t between 1 and 8 inclusive.\n\nNow, to minimize H, the number of turns from start to end.\n\nSince we start at y=0, and need to be at y=9, the minimal number of up moves is 9, so minimal H is 10: from t=1 to t=10, y10=9, with 9 up actions.\n\nBut we might need to stay or move down, which increases H.\n\nSo we should try to achieve with H=10 if possible.\n\nWith H=10, we have 9 actions from t=1 to t=9, setting y2 to y10.\n\ny1=0, after 9 ups, y10=9.\n\nBut we need to check for t=2 to t=9, since y1=0 safe, y10=9 safe.\n\ny_t for t=2 to 9 must be between 1 and 8, and we need no collision at those turns.\n\nIn the sequence, y_t is set at turn t, based on previous action.\n\ny1=0 at t=1\n\na1 at t=1: determines y2\n\nThen at t=2, y2 is position, check collision if y2 in 1-8.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nFor H=10, we have y1=0, y2, y3, ..., y10=9.\n\nWith y10=9, meaning after 9 up actions.\n\ny2 = y1 + Δy1, since y1=0, if a1=U, y2=1, etc.\n\nTo have y10=9, we need exactly 9 up actions and no down or stay, because each down or stay would require an extra up to compensate, increasing H.\n\nFor example, if we stay once, we need 10 up actions to reach y=9 from y=0, so H=11.\n\nSimilarly, if we move down once, we need to go up more.\n\nSo for minimal H, we should have no down or stay; all actions should be U, except possibly when we need to avoid being on a row at unsafe time.\n\nBut with only U, we go through each row sequentially.\n\nSequence with all U:\n\nt=1: y1=0, safe (not freeway)\n\na1=U: y2=1\n\nt=2: y2=1, freeway 1. At t=2, as we saw, safe, since not unsafe at t=2.\n\ny=1 unsafe only at t=1, which we avoided.\n\na2=U: y3=2\n\nt=3: y3=2, freeway 2. Now at t=3, is y=2 safe? From earlier, y=2 unsafe at t=6,7,8; t=3 is before, so should be safe.\n\nCheck: at t=3, for y=2, cars: we need 0 not in any span.\n\nAt t=3, T=3.\n\nFirst car: [41+4(3-1)=41+8=49, 52+8=60] [49,60], 0 not in\n\nSecond: [5+4(2)=5+8=13, 16+8=24] [13,24], 0 not in\n\nThird: [-31+4(2)= -31+8= -23, -20+8= -12] [-23,-12], 0 not in (since negative)\n\nSo yes, safe at t=3.\n\na3=U: y4=3\n\nt=4: y4=3, freeway 3. Always safe, as established.\n\na4=U: y5=4\n\nt=5: y5=4, freeway 4, always safe.\n\na5=U: y6=5\n\nt=6: y6=5, freeway 5. Now at t=6, is it safe?\n\ny=5 unsafe at t=8,9; t=6 is before, should be safe.\n\nCheck: at t=6, T=6.\n\nFirst car: span [-53+6(5)= -53+30= -23, -42+30= -12] [-23,-12], 0 not in\n\nSecond car: span [-5+6(5)= -5+30=25, 6+30=36] [25,36], 0 not in\n\nSo safe.\n\na6=U: y7=6\n\nt=7: y7=6, freeway 6. But y=6 unsafe at t=2, and t=7>2, so should be safe? At t=7, T=7.\n\nCar on y=6: left-moving, span [24 -24(7-1), 47-24(6)] = [24 -24*6, 47-144] = [24-144, 47-144] = [-120, -97], all negative, 0 not in, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=7 at t=7: car same, span [-120,-97], safe.\n\nBut in sequence, we are at y=6 at t=7.\n\na7=U: y8=7\n\nt=8: y8=7, freeway 7. At t=8, car span [24 -24(7), 47-24*7] = [24-168, 47-168] = [-144, -121], 0 not in, safe.\n\na8=U: y9=8\n\nt=9: y9=8, freeway 8. At t=9, T=9.\n\nCar: left-moving, s=36, span [12 -36(8), 47-36*8] = [12-288, 47-288] = [-276, -241], 0 not in, safe.\n\na9=U: y10=9\n\nt=10: y10=9, safe, goal.\n\nNow, check for collision at each turn:\n\nt=1: y1=0, not freeway, safe\n\nt=2: y2=1, freeway 1, span at t=2: [ -47+48(1)=1, 48(1)=48] [1,48], 0 not in, safe\n\nt=3: y3=2, freeway 2, as above, at t=3, all spans not cover 0, safe\n\nt=4: y4=3, freeway 3, always safe\n\nt=5: y5=4, freeway 4, always safe\n\nt=6: y6=5, freeway 5, at t=6: first car [-53+30= -23, -42+30= -12] no; second car [-5+30=25, 36] no, safe\n\nt=7: y7=6, freeway 6, span at t=7: [24-24*6=24-144=-120, 47-144=-97] [-120,-97], 0 not in, safe\n\nt=8: y8=7, freeway 7, similarly [24-168=-144, 47-168=-121] [-144,-121], safe\n\nt=9: y9=8, freeway 8, at t=9: [12-36*8=12-288=-276, 47-288=-241] [-276,-241], safe\n\nt=10: y10=9, safe.\n\nAll safe, and we reached in 10 turns.\n\nBut H is the number of turns? y10=9 at turn 10, so we started at turn 1, ended at turn 10, so 10 turns? But the sequence has actions from t=1 to t=9, 9 actions.\n\nIn the problem, the minimal number of turns H, and sequence of actions from t=0 to H-1? No.\n\nIn the task: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\"\n\nt_1 is given as 1.\n\nSo actions for t from t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nIn this case, t_1=1, actions at t=1,2,3,..., up to t=1+H-1 = H.\n\nThen after these actions, at time t_1 + H, position is y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nWe want y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nIn my sequence, with actions at t=1 to t=9 (9 actions), y_{10} =9.\n\nSo H should be the number of actions? Or the number of turns including start?\n\nThe problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\" and \"reach (0,9)\".\n\nIn the sequence, {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}, so t from 0 to H-1, so H actions.\n\nThen after H actions, at time t_1 + H, position is set.\n\nStart at time t_1, position given.\n\nAfter action a_{t_1}, at time t_1+1, position y_{t_1+1}\n\n...\n\nAfter action a_{t_1 + H -1}, at time t_1 + H, position y_{t_1 + H}\n\nWe want y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nAnd for each time from t_1 to t_1 + H -1? Collision is checked at each turn T for y_T.\n\nT from t_1 to t_1 + H -1? Let's see.\n\nAt time T, for T from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, we have position y_T, and we check collision if y_T in 1-8.\n\nAt time t_1 + H, we have y_{t_1 + H} =9, which is safe, no check needed.\n\nIn the sequence, times involved: from t_1 to t_1 + H.\n\nCollision checked at T for T from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, since at T=t_1 + H, if y=9, no issue.\n\nIn my earlier, t_1=1, H=9 actions? Let's define.\n\nSuppose H is the number of actions.\n\nThen actions at times: t_1, t_1+1, ..., t_1 + H -1\n\nAfter actions, at time t_1 + H, position y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nCollision checked at times T from t_1 to t_1 + H -1 for y_T.\n\nIn the path: time t_1: position y_{t_1}, check collision if applicable\n\nAfter action a_{t_1}, position y_{t_1 +1} at time t_1+1, check, and so on, up to time t_1 + H -1: position y_{t_1 + H -1}, check.\n\nAt time t_1 + H, position y_{t_1 + H} =9, no check.\n\nIn my all-up sequence:\n\nt_1=1\n\ny1=0 at time 1, no collision (y=0)\n\na1=U: y2=1 at time 2\n\ny2=1, check at time 2: safe\n\na2=U: y3=2 at time 3\n\ny3=2, check at time 3: safe\n\na3=U: y4=3 at time 4\n\ny4=3, check: safe\n\na4=U: y5=4 at time 5\n\ny5=4, check: safe\n\na5=U: y6=5 at time 6\n\ny6=5, check: safe\n\na6=U: y7=6 at time 7\n\ny7=6, check: safe\n\na7=U: y8=7 at time 8\n\ny8=7, check: safe\n\na8=U: y9=8 at time 9\n\ny9=8, check: safe\n\na9=U: y10=9 at time 10\n\nNow, collision checked at times 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9, all safe as above.\n\nWe have 9 actions, from t=1 to t=9.\n\nH=9, actions at t_1 + t for t=0 to H-1, so t from 0 to 8? Let's see.\n\nt_1 + t for t=0 to H-1: when t=0, time t_1; t=1, time t_1+1; ... t=H-1, time t_1 + H -1.\n\nSo in this case, H=9, actions at times 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9.\n\nAfter that, at time 10, y=9.\n\nYes.\n\nAnd we reached in minimal turns, since no extra moves.\n\nBut earlier I thought about unsafe times, but in this path, we avoided all unsafe times naturally.\n\nFor example, y=2 at t=3, which is before unsafe t=6,7,8.\n\ny=5 at t=6, which is before unsafe t=8,9.\n\ny=6 at t=7, which is after unsafe t=2, so safe.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nSo it works with all U actions.\n\nBut the problem is to output the sequence.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be like:\n\nTurn 1: U\n\nTurn 2: U\n\n...\n\nUp to Turn 9: U\n\nBut let's confirm the car on y=6,7,8 at later times.\n\nAt t=7, y=6, span as above negative, safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps I should list the actions.\n\nBut in the car state, freeway 6 and 7 have cars, but at t=7, they are far left, not covering 0.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo minimal H is 9, with all U actions.\n\nBut is there a shorter path? From y=0 to y=9, we need at least 9 up moves, so minimum 9 actions, H=9.\n\nIf we could move faster, but no, only one step per turn.\n\nSo H=9 is minimal.\n\nAnd we achieved it.\n\nBut in the initial thought, I had unsafe times, but in this sequence, we didn't hit them.\n\nFor example, if we were on y=2 at t=6, it would be unsafe, but we are there at t=3.\n\nSimilarly, y=5 at t=8 would be unsafe, but we are at t=6.\n\ny=6 at t=2 unsafe, but we are at t=7.\n\nSo all good.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is all U from turn 1 to turn 9.\n\nBut let's write it in the format.\n\nAnswer should be:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 1: U\nTurn 2: U\nTurn 3: U\nTurn 4: U\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\n}\n\nWith H=9.\n\nBut H is the minimal number of turns, which is 9.\n\nIn the box, it should be the actions.\n\nThe problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\", but in the answer format, it only shows the sequence, so probably H is implied or not needed in box.\n\nThe box contains the action sequence.\n\nSo for this, it should be fine.\n\nBut let me double-check if at any point it might be unsafe.\n\nAt turn 2: y=1, freeway 1, car span at t=2: [ -47 +48(1) =1, 48(1)=48] so [1,48], 0 not in, safe.\n\nTurn 3: y=2, freeway 2, at t=3: cars spans: [41+8=49,52+8=60], [5+8=13,16+8=24], [-31+8=-23,-20+8=-12], all not cover 0, safe.\n\nTurn 4: y=3, freeway 3, cars at t=4: [49+12(3)=49+36=85,60+36=96]? At T=4, t-1=3, [49+12(3)=49+36=85,60+36=96], [1+12(3)=1+36=37,12+36=48], both min>0, safe.\n\nSimilarly, turn 5: y=4, same as y=3, safe.\n\nTurn 6: y=5, freeway 5, at t=6: first car [-53+6(5)= -53+30= -23, -42+30= -12], [-23,-12], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car [-5+6(5)= -5+30=25, 6+30=36], [25,36], 0 not in. Safe.\n\nTurn 7: y=6, freeway 6, car at t=7: [24 -24(6) =24-144= -120, 47-144= -97], [-120,-97], 0 not in. Safe.\n\nTurn 8: y=7, freeway 7, same car, at t=8: [24-24(7)=24-168=-144,47-168=-121], [-144,-121], safe.\n\nTurn 9: y=8, freeway 8, car at t=9: [12 -36(8)=12-288=-276, 47-288=-241], [-276,-241], safe.\n\nThen after turn 9 action U, y10=9.\n\nAll good.\n\nPerhaps we can start later, but no need, this is minimal.\n\nOr with stays, but that would increase H.\n\nSo I think this is correct.\n\nBut in the car state, freeway 2 has a car that at t=1, but we not on y=2 at t=1.\n\nSimilarly, all fine.\n\nSo the sequence is all U for 9 turns.\n\nBut to write in the answer.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 0) at turn \\(t_1 = 1\\) and needs to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 9, achieved by moving up (U) at every turn from turn 1 to turn 9. This sequence ensures the player reaches \\(y = 9\\) at turn 10 without any collisions, as verified below:\n\n- **Turn 1**: Player at (0, 0) (not a freeway, safe). Action \\(U\\) moves to (0, 1) at turn 2.\n- **Turn 2**: Player at (0, 1) (freeway 1). Car span at turn 2: \\([-47 + 48(2-1), 48(2-1)] = [1, 48]\\), 0 not in span, safe.

Action \\(U\\) moves to (0, 9) at turn 10.\n\nAt turn 10, the player is at (0, 9), which is the goal and not a freeway, so no collision check is needed.

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to get the player from (0,1) at turn t1=2 to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing the y-position by +1, -1, or 0 respectively, and y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCollision happens only if at some turn T, the player is on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there's a car where 0 is in its span at that turn. The note says that if you move to a different y at turn T, you're not considered on that new y until the next turn, so you only check the car on your current y at turn T.\n\nThe car positions are given at turn t1=2, and they move with constant speed. For left-moving cars, the span moves left, and for right-moving, it moves right. The span is defined with head and tail, so for left-moving, head is larger, tail smaller, and it decreases; for right-moving, head is smaller, tail larger, and it increases.\n\nI should compute where the cars will be at future turns relative to x=0 for each freeway.\n\nLet me list all the cars for each freeway at turn t1=2:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (h=48, τ=1, d=right, s=48)\n\nSince d=right, and it's moving right, so at turn T, span is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] = [1 + 48(T-2), 48 + 48(T-2)]\n\nBut collision is when 0 is in the span, so we need to see for which T, 0 is between 1 + 48(T-2) and 48 + 48(T-2).\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFreeway 2 has three cars: (56,45,right,4), (20,9,right,4), (-16,-27,right,4)\n\nFreeway 3: two cars: (-48,-59,right,12), (24,13,right,12)\n\nFreeway 4: same as freeway 3? It says: (-48,-59,right,12), (24,13,right,12) — identical to freeway 3. Is that a typo or intentional? I'll assume it's correct, so freeway 4 has the same cars as freeway 3.\n\nFreeway 5: (-36,-47,right,6), (12,1,right,6)\n\nFreeway 6: (0,23,left,24) — d=left, so moving left.\n\nFreeway 7: (0,23,left,24) — same as freeway 6.\n\nFreeway 8: (-24,11,left,36) — d=left.\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need to find when a car covers x=0 at turn T.\n\nSince collision is when 0 is in the span for that freeway at turn T.\n\nLet me define Δt = T - t1 = T - 2, so for a given Δt, position at turn T=2 + Δt.\n\nFor freeway k, I need the set of Δt where 0 is covered by some car on that freeway.\n\nThen, for the player, at each turn, if they are on y, and at that turn, y has a car covering 0, collision.\n\nBut since the player moves at the same time, I need to simulate the path.\n\nFirst, let's compute for each freeway the times when it's blocked, i.e., when 0 is covered.\n\nStart with freeway 1:\n\nCar: d=right, s=48, h=48, τ=1 at T=2.\n\nSpan at T: [1 + 48(Δt), 48 + 48(Δt)] for Δt >=0\n\n0 is in [1 + 48Δt, 48 + 48Δt] if 1 + 48Δt <= 0 <= 48 + 48Δt\n\nBut 1 + 48Δt <=0 implies 48Δt <= -1, so Δt <= -1/48, not possible since Δt >=0.\n\n0 <= 48 + 48Δt always true for Δt>=0.\n\nBut 1 + 48Δt <=0 is false for Δt>=0, so 0 is never in the interval because the left end is at least 1 when Δt=0, and increases, so always >1, so 0 is never covered. Thus freeway 1 is never blocked? But let's see.\n\nAt Δt=0, span [1,48], 0 not in it.\n\nAs Δt increases, left end increases, so 0 always left of span, so never covered. So freeway 1 is safe at all times. Is that right?\n\nd=right, moving right, so at T=2, it's from 1 to 48, all positive, and moving right, so x=0 is never reached. Yes, so freeway 1 has no collision at any time.\n\nBut the player starts on y=1 at t=2, and freeway 1 has no car at x=0 ever, so it should be safe to be there at t=2.\n\nNow freeway 2: three cars, all right-moving, s=4.\n\nFirst car: (56,45,right,4) — head=56, tail=45? But for right-moving, the span should be [tail, head] or [head, tail]? The notation says: for right-moving, span at t1 is [τ, h], and it moves to [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nIn the car update, for right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nHere for this car, τ=45, h=56? τ is tail, h is head? But in the list, it's given as (head, tail, dir, speed), I think.\n\nLook at the table: \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nFor freeway 2: (56,45,right,4) so h=56, τ=45, d=right, s=4.\n\nFor right-moving, Span(t1) = [τ, h] = [45,56] at T=2.\n\nThen at T, Span = [45 + 4Δt, 56 + 4Δt]\n\n0 in [45+4Δt, 56+4Δt]? Since 45+4Δt >=45 >0 for Δt>=0, so always positive, never covers 0. Similarly, left end min is 45, so 0 never in it.\n\nSecond car on freeway 2: (20,9,right,4) so h=20, τ=9, d=right.\n\nSpan at T: [9 + 4Δt, 20 + 4Δt]\n\n0 in [9+4Δt,20+4Δt]? 9+4Δt >=9>0, so never.\n\nThird car: (-16,-27,right,4) h=-16, τ=-27? τ=-27, h=-16.\n\nSpan at T: [τ + sΔt, h + sΔt] = [-27 + 4Δt, -16 + 4Δt]\n\n0 in [-27+4Δt, -16+4Δt] if -27+4Δt <= 0 <= -16+4Δt\n\nSo 0 <= -16+4Δt implies 4Δt >=16, Δt >=4\n\nAnd -27+4Δt <=0 implies 4Δt <=27, Δt <= 27/4 = 6.75\n\nSo for Δt from 4 to 6.75, but since turns are integer, Δt integer, so at Δt=4,5,6,7? Let's see:\n\nAt Δt=4: [-27+16, -16+16] = [-11,0], so [ -11, 0 ], 0 is included, since it's <= or >=? The span is inclusive, I assume, so if 0 is endpoint, it should be collision.\n\nSimilarly, Δt=5: [-27+20, -16+20] = [-7,4], 0 in [-7,4], yes.\n\nΔt=6: [-27+24, -16+24] = [-3,8], 0 in it.\n\nΔt=7: [-27+28, -16+28] = [1,12], 0 not in [1,12]\n\nSo for Δt=4,5,6, 0 is covered by this car on freeway 2.\n\nBut freeway 2 has multiple cars, but this one covers at those times.\n\nThe other cars don't cover 0, so freeway 2 is blocked at Δt=4,5,6 (T=6,7,8)\n\nΔt= T-2, so T=6,7,8.\n\nNow freeway 3: cars (-48,-59,right,12) and (24,13,right,12)\n\nFirst car: h=-48, τ=-59, d=right? Span at T: [τ + sΔt, h + sΔt] = [-59 + 12Δt, -48 + 12Δt]\n\n0 in [-59+12Δt, -48+12Δt] if -59+12Δt <=0 <= -48+12Δt\n\nSo 0 <= -48+12Δt => 12Δt >=48 => Δt >=4\n\nAnd -59+12Δt <=0 => 12Δt <=59 => Δt <= 59/12 ≈4.916, so for integer Δt, Δt=4 and 5? At Δt=4: [-59+48, -48+48] = [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nΔt=5: [-59+60, -48+60] = [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo only at Δt=4, T=6.\n\nBut let's confirm: at Δt=4, [-11,0], yes 0 in it.\n\nSecond car: (24,13,right,12) h=24, τ=13, span [13+12Δt, 24+12Δt], min 13>0, never covers 0.\n\nSo freeway 3 blocked only at Δt=4 (T=6)\n\nSimilarly, freeway 4 is same as freeway 3, so also blocked at Δt=4 (T=6)\n\nNow freeway 5: cars (-36,-47,right,6) and (12,1,right,6)\n\nFirst car: h=-36, τ=-47, d=right, span [τ + sΔt, h + sΔt] = [-47 + 6Δt, -36 + 6Δt]\n\n0 in [-47+6Δt, -36+6Δt] if -47+6Δt <=0 <= -36+6Δt\n\nSo 0 <= -36+6Δt => 6Δt >=36 => Δt >=6\n\nAnd -47+6Δt <=0 => 6Δt <=47 => Δt <= 47/6 ≈7.833\n\nSo for Δt=6,7,8? Δt=6: [-47+36, -36+36] = [-11,0], 0 in\n\nΔt=7: [-47+42, -36+42] = [-5,6], 0 in\n\nΔt=8: [-47+48, -36+48] = [1,12], 0 not in\n\nSo Δt=6,7 (T=8,9)\n\nSecond car: (12,1,right,6) span [1+6Δt, 12+6Δt], min 1>0, never covers 0.\n\nSo freeway 5 blocked at Δt=6,7 (T=8,9)\n\nNow freeway 6: car (0,23,left,24)\n\nd=left, so for left-moving, Span(t1) = [h, τ] → [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nHere h=0, τ=23? But for left-moving, head is larger, tail smaller? In the update: left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s Δt, τ - s Δt]\n\nAnd since it's left-moving, h should be the right end, τ left end? At t1, given as (head, tail), so for left-moving, head is at position, and since moving left, head decreases.\n\nIn this case, at t1=2, h=0, τ=23, d=left, s=24.\n\nSpan at T: [h - s Δt, τ - s Δt] = [0 - 24Δt, 23 - 24Δt]\n\nNow, 0 in [ -24Δt, 23 - 24Δt ] ?\n\nSince moving left, the span is [left, right] with left decreasing.\n\n0 in [ -24Δt, 23 - 24Δt ] if min <=0<= max.\n\nNow, -24Δt <= 0 always for Δt>=0, and 0 <= 23 - 24Δt only if 23 - 24Δt >=0, so 24Δt <=23, Δt <=23/24 <1, so for integer Δt>=0, only possible if Δt=0.\n\nAt Δt=0, T=2, span [0, 23], so 0 in [0,23], yes, covered.\n\nFor Δt>0, 23-24Δt <0 for Δt>=1, so span like [-24, -1] for Δt=1, all negative, 0 not in.\n\nSo freeway 6 blocked only at Δt=0 (T=2)\n\nSimilarly, freeway 7 same as freeway 6, so blocked only at T=2.\n\nNow freeway 8: car (-24,11,left,36)\n\nd=left, h=-24, τ=11? Span at T: [h - s Δt, τ - s Δt] = [-24 - 36Δt, 11 - 36Δt]\n\n0 in [ -24 -36Δt, 11 -36Δt ] ?\n\n-24 -36Δt <=0 always, and 0 <= 11 -36Δt only if 11-36Δt >=0, so 36Δt <=11, Δt <=11/36 <1, so only Δt=0 possible.\n\nAt Δt=0, T=2, span [-24,11], 0 in [-24,11], yes.\n\nFor Δt>0, e.g. Δt=1, [-24-36, 11-36] = [-60,-25], all negative, 0 not in.\n\nSo freeway 8 blocked only at T=2.\n\nNow, summarize blocked times for each freeway:\n\ny=1: never blocked (from earlier)\n\ny=2: blocked at T=6,7,8 (Δt=4,5,6)\n\ny=3: blocked at T=6 (Δt=4)\n\ny=4: same as y=3, blocked at T=6\n\ny=5: blocked at T=8,9 (Δt=6,7)\n\ny=6: blocked only at T=2\n\ny=7: blocked only at T=2\n\ny=8: blocked only at T=2\n\nPlayer starts at t=2 on y=1.\n\nAt t=2, for y=1: not blocked, so safe.\n\nBut y=6,7,8 are blocked at t=2, but player is on y=1, so not affected.\n\nNow, player needs to go to y=9. y=9 is the goal, and there are no cars on y=9, I assume, since freeways are y=1 to 8.\n\nThe vertical axis is y=0 to 9, and freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nPlayer starts at (0,1) at t=2.\n\nGoal is to reach (0,9), so y=9.\n\nMinimal turns: since from y=1 to y=9, difference is 8, so at least 8 moves up, but can stay or move down, but to minimize turns, probably go up as much as possible.\n\nBut need to avoid collisions.\n\nNow, the path: at each turn, player chooses action, moves to new y at next turn.\n\nImportant: collision is checked at the beginning of the turn, before action? Let's see the dynamics.\n\nFrom the player update: at turn t, player is at (0, y_t), then chooses action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if at that turn, y_T is such that for freeway y_T, 0 is in some car's span at T.\n\nSo when player is at position at turn T, we check the cars on that y at that same turn T.\n\nFor example, at turn T, player is on y_T, we check if y_T freeway has a car covering x=0 at time T.\n\nIf yes, collision.\n\nNow, when player moves: suppose at turn T, player is on y, and moves to y' at turn T+1.\n\nAt turn T, they are on y, so check cars on y at T.\n\nAt turn T+1, they are on y', check cars on y' at T+1.\n\nThe action a_t is chosen at turn t, affecting y_{t+1}.\n\nIn the sequence, for turn t, action a_t determines y_{t+1}.\n\nBut collision is based on the position at turn t and the cars at turn t.\n\nIn this case, t1=2, player at (0,1), so at turn 2, position y=1.\n\nWe need to find actions from a_{2}, a_{3}, ..., up to some H where at turn t1 + H -1, y=9? Let's see the turn indexing.\n\nThe player position is given at turn t1=2 as (0,1).\n\nThen actions a_t for t = t1 to t1 + H -1? The sequence is {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}, so a_{t1 + t} for t from 0 to H-1.\n\nt=0: a_{t1 +0} = a_{t1} = a_2\n\nt=1: a_{t1+1} = a_3\n\n...\n\nt=H-1: a_{t1 + H-1} = a_{2 + H -1}\n\nAfter action a_{2 + H -1}, the position is y_{2 + H -1 +1} = y_{2 + H}\n\nThe position after action at turn t is y_{t+1}.\n\nAt turn t, after action a_t, y_{t+1} is set.\n\nThe goal is to reach (0,9), so y_{t} =9 for some t.\n\nSpecifically, the minimal H such that after H actions, we are at y=9.\n\nStart at turn t1=2, position y_2 =1.\n\nAfter action a_2, y_3 = y_2 + Δy_2, and so on.\n\nAfter H actions, we have y_{2+H}, and we want y_{2+H} =9.\n\nThe sequence of actions is from a_2 to a_{2+H-1}, so H actions, to reach y_{2+H} =9.\n\nCollision: at each turn T, when we are at y_T, we must not have collision on freeway y_T at time T.\n\nFor turn T, position y_T, check if freeway y_T is blocked at T.\n\nNow, we start at T=2, y_2=1.\n\nAt T=2, y=1, freeway 1 not blocked, so safe.\n\nThen we choose a_2, which determines y_3.\n\nSimilarly, at T=3, we are at y_3, check collision, and so on.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\ny from 1 to 9, so we need to increase y by 8, but can stay or go down, but to minimize H, we should go up as much as possible, avoiding blocked times.\n\nH is the number of turns from t1, so minimal H means we want to reach as soon as possible.\n\nSince we start at y=1, target y=9, difference 8, so if we go up every turn, we reach in 8 moves: after 8 actions, y_{10} =1 +8 =9, at turn 10.\n\nBut we need to check if we can do that without collision.\n\nThe path would be: at T=2, y=1, safe as above.\n\nAction a_2: let's say U, then y_3 = y_2 +1 =2\n\nAt T=3, y=2, now check freeway 2 at T=3.\n\nFreeway 2 blocked at T=6,7,8, not at T=3.\n\nAt T=3, Δt= T-2=1, for freeway 2.\n\nEarlier, freeway 2 blocked at Δt=4,5,6, so T=6,7,8.\n\nAt T=3, Δt=1, not blocked, so safe.\n\nThen a_3: U, y_4=3\n\nAt T=4, y=3, freeway 3 blocked only at T=6, not at T=4. T=4, Δt=2, freeway 3 blocked at Δt=4, T=6, so at T=4, not blocked. Safe.\n\na_4: U, y_5=4\n\nAt T=5, y=4, freeway 4 blocked at T=6, not at T=5. Safe.\n\na_5: U, y_6=5\n\nAt T=6, y=5, freeway 5 blocked at T=8,9, not at T=6. T=6, Δt=4, freeway 5 blocked at Δt=6,7, T=8,9. So at T=6, not blocked. Safe.\n\na_6: U, y_7=6\n\nAt T=7, y=6, freeway 6 blocked only at T=2, not at T=7. Safe.\n\na_7: U, y_8=7\n\nAt T=8, y=7, freeway 7 blocked only at T=2, not at T=8. Safe.\n\na_8: U, y_9=8\n\nAt T=9, y=8, freeway 8 blocked only at T=2, not at T=9. Safe.\n\nThen a_9: U, y_10=9, reached.\n\nBut at T=10, we are at y=9, but y=9 has no freeway, so no car, safe. The goal is to be at (0,9), which is achieved at turn 10.\n\nNow, H: we have actions from a2 to a9, that's 8 actions: t from 2 to 9, actions a2 to a9, 8 actions, reaching y10=9.\n\nThe sequence: actions at turn 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9.\n\nIn terms of the sequence: {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}, with H=8.\n\nt=0: a2, t=1: a3, ..., t=7: a9, so H=8.\n\nIs this safe? In the above, at each turn, when on a freeway, it wasn't blocked.\n\nBut let's confirm the blocked times:\n\nAt T=2: y=1, freeway1 never blocked, safe.\n\nT=3: y=2, freeway2 blocked at T=6,7,8; T=3 not, safe.\n\nT=4: y=3, freeway3 blocked at T=6; T=4 not, safe.\n\nT=5: y=4, freeway4 blocked at T=6; T=5 not, safe.\n\nT=6: y=5, freeway5 blocked at T=8,9; T=6 not, safe.\n\nT=7: y=6, freeway6 blocked only at T=2, T=7 not, safe.\n\nT=8: y=7, freeway7 blocked only at T=2, T=8 not, safe.\n\nT=9: y=8, freeway8 blocked only at T=2, T=9 not, safe.\n\nThen at T=10, y=9, no freeway, safe.\n\nSo with all U actions, we reach in 8 turns, no collision.\n\nBut is there a shorter path? y from 1 to 9, minimum 8 moves up, so H=8 is minimum possible, since each U increases y by 1, and we need to go from 1 to 9, so at least 8 U actions. If we do S or D, it takes more turns, so H would be larger. Thus minimal H is 8, and we have a sequence.\n\nBut in the sequence, we start at t=2, after 8 actions, at t=10, y=9.\n\nBut the player position is at turn t, so at turn 10, position (0,9).\n\nIn the action sequence, we need to specify actions from a2 to a9.\n\nBut let's write it.\n\nThe answer should be actions for turns starting from t1=2.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nThen at turn 10, y=9.\n\nBut the sequence has H=8 actions.\n\nIn the boxed format.\n\nBut is there any issue?\n\nEarlier for freeway 2, it is blocked at T=6,7,8, but in this path, we are on y=2 at T=3, not at T=6,7,8.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nBut let me double-check freeway 5.\n\nFreeway 5 blocked at T=8,9.\n\nAt T=8, we are on y=7, not y=5.\n\nAt T=9, on y=8, not y=5.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nBut the player could go faster? No, 8 steps is minimum.\n\nPerhaps start by staying or something, but that would increase H.\n\nFor example, if at some point we need to avoid, but in this case, no need.\n\nBut at the beginning, at T=2, we are on y=1, which is safe, but freeway y=6,7,8 are blocked at T=2, but we are not on them.\n\nNow, in the sequence, after a2=U, we go to y=2 at T=3.\n\nCould we go down? But y=0 might be safe, but going down would take us away from target, increasing H.\n\nSimilarly, staying would not help.\n\nSo all U is fine.\n\nBut let me confirm if at any point we might be forced to avoid.\n\nFor example, when we are on y=5 at T=6, freeway 5 is not blocked at T=6, only at T=8,9.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nBut in freeway 2, there is a car that covers at T=6,7,8, but we are not on y=2 at those times.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nAnother thing: the car on freeway 6,7,8 are blocked only at T=2, so after that, they are safe.\n\nIn this path, we pass y=6 at T=7, which is fine.\n\nBut is there a shorter path? No, because from y=1 to y=9, need 8 increments.\n\nUnless we can jump, but no, only +1 per U.\n\nSo H=8 is minimum.\n\nBut in the sequence, actions from a2 to a9, 8 actions.\n\nNow, the turn when we reach: after a9 at turn 9, we go to y10=9.\n\nThe position at turn 10 is (0,9).\n\nThe minimal H is 8.\n\nBut let me see the answer format.\n\nWe need to output the sequence.\n\nBut in the problem, it says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\"\n\nIn the answer, it should be the actions.\n\nBut in this case, all U.\n\nBut perhaps I missed something.\n\nAt T=2, if we do S, we stay at y=1, but then we need more actions to reach y=9, so H larger.\n\nSimilarly, D to y=0, then need to go up, more steps.\n\nSo no benefit.\n\nPerhaps for some freeways, we need to avoid at certain times.\n\nBut in this path, no issue.\n\nAnother point: freeway 4 is same as 3, but we pass y=4 at T=5, which is not blocked.\n\nBlocked at T=6.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut let me list the blocked times again to be thorough.\n\nFreeway y=1: never blocked\n\ny=2: blocked T=6,7,8\n\ny=3: blocked T=6\n\ny=4: blocked T=6\n\ny=5: blocked T=8,9\n\ny=6: blocked only T=2\n\ny=7: blocked only T=2\n\ny=8: blocked only T=2\n\nIn the path: T=2: y=1, safe\n\nT=3: y=2, not blocked (blocked at 6,7,8)\n\nT=4: y=3, not blocked (blocked at 6)\n\nT=5: y=4, not blocked (blocked at 6)\n\nT=6: y=5, not blocked (blocked at 8,9)\n\nT=7: y=6, not blocked (blocked only at 2)\n\nT=8: y=7, not blocked (blocked only at 2)\n\nT=9: y=8, not blocked (blocked only at 2)\n\nT=10: y=9, safe\n\nAll good.\n\nPerhaps we can reach earlier, but no, since start at y=1, need to be at y=9, at least 8 steps.\n\nUnless we start moving earlier, but t starts at 2.\n\nMinimal H is 8.\n\nSo the sequence should be all U for 8 turns.\n\nBut let's write the actions.\n\nActions: a2=U, a3=U, a4=U, a5=U, a6=U, a7=U, a8=U, a9=U\n\nIn the answer, for each turn.\n\nNow, the player position is at (0,1) at turn t1=2.\n\nAfter a2=U, at turn 3, position (0,2)\n\nAfter a3=U, turn 4, (0,3)\n\n...\n\nAfter a8=U, turn 9, (0,8)\n\nAfter a9=U, turn 10, (0,9)\n\nReached.\n\nThe sequence is from turn 2 to turn 9, actions.\n\nIn the boxed format:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 2: U\nTurn 3: U\nTurn 4: U\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\n}\n\nBut H is 8, and we have 8 actions.\n\nThe turn labels: Turn 2, Turn 3, ..., Turn 9.\n\nIn the sequence, it should be clear.\n\nPerhaps we need to specify until the action before reaching, but since we reach after the last action.\n\nIn the sequence, after a9 at turn 9, we reach at turn 10.\n\nBut the action at turn 9 is included.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nTo confirm, suppose H=7 actions: then after 7 actions, y_{2+7} = y9, which could be at most 1+7=8 if all U, or less, so y9=8, not 9. To reach y=9, need at least 8 U actions, so H=8 is minimum.\n\nIf we do some S, then y increases slower, so H larger.\n\nThus minimal H is 8 with all U.\n\nBut in the car states, for freeway 2, there was a car that covers at T=6,7,8, but we are not on y=2 at those times.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nPerhaps at T=2, we are on y=1, but if we do nothing, but we must move to reach.\n\nI think it's correct.\n\nSo the answer should be the sequence above.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 1)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 2\\) is 8. The sequence of actions consists of moving up (U) at every turn from turn 2 to turn 9, resulting in the player reaching y=9 at turn 10.\n\n### Verification of Collision Avoidance:\n- At each turn, the player's position and the car positions are checked for collision. Collision occurs only if the player is on a freeway (y=1 to 8) and x=0 is within the span of any car on that freeway at the same turn.\n- The car block times for each freeway are:\n  - y=1: Never blocked.\n  - y=2: Blocked at turns 6, 7, 8.\n  - y=3: Blocked at turn 6.\n  - y=4: Blocked at turn 6 (same as y=3).\n  - y=5: Blocked at turns 8, 9.\n  - y=6: Blocked only at turn 2.\n  - y=7: Blocked only at turn 2.\n  - y=8: Blocked only at turn 2.\n- Path verification:\n  - Turn 2: Player at y=1 (freeway 1, not blocked; safe).\n  - Turn 3: Player at y=2 (freeway 2, not blocked at turn 3; safe).\n  - Turn 4: Player at y=3 (freeway 3, not blocked at turn 4; safe).\n  - Turn 5: Player at y=4 (freeway 4, not blocked at turn 5; safe).\n  - Turn 6: Player at y=5 (freeway 5, not blocked at turn 6; safe).\n  - Turn 7: Player at y=6 (freeway 6, not blocked at turn 7; safe).\n  - Turn 8: Player at y=7 (freeway 7, not blocked at turn 8; safe).\n  - Turn 9: Player at y=8 (freeway 8, not blocked at turn 9; safe).\n  - Turn 10: Player at y=9 (no freeway; safe and goal reached).\n\n### Action Sequence:\nThe sequence of actions from turn 2 to turn 9 (8 actions) is all U (up), as this directly moves the player upward with no unnecessary delays, achieving the goal in the minimal turns.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 2: U \\\\\nTurn 3: U \\\\\nTurn 4: U \\\\\nTurn 5: U \\\\\nTurn 6: U \\\\\nTurn 7: U \\\\\nTurn 8: U \\\\\nTurn 9: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to get from position (0,2) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t_1 = 3, but since we're starting from turn t_1, I should think of this as time t=0 for simplicity in the sequence. The actions will be from turn t_1 onwards.\n\nThe player position is updated based on actions: U for up (y increases by 1), D for down (y decreases by 1), S for stay (y stays the same). y must stay between 0 and 9, inclusive.\n\nCars move on their freeways. For each car, I need to know where it is at any given turn to avoid being on that y-level when the car's span includes 0.\n\nCollision occurs only if at turn T, the player is on freeway y_T, and there is a car on that freeway whose span includes 0 at that exact turn. Importantly, if you move to a new y-level at turn T, you are not considered on that new level until the next turn. So at turn T, you are on y_T, and after action, you move to y_{T+1} for turn T+1.\n\nThe key point: when you perform an action at turn T, you move to y_{T+1}, but for collision, at turn T, you are on y_T, and you check cars on y_T at that turn. Then, after moving, at turn T+1, you are on y_{T+1}, and check cars there.\n\nFrom the note: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 in Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\" And \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 in Span(T) but not Span(T+1).\"\n\nSo, at turn T, you are on y_T, and collision depends on cars on y_T at turn T. Only after the action do you change y for the next turn.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=2 to y=9. Since y increases upward, and 9 is the top, I probably need to move up most of the time. But I have to avoid the cars on y=1 to 8 when they are dangerous.\n\nFirst, let's list all the cars and their movements. The current turn is t_1 = 3, so let's set t=0 as the starting point for simplicity in calculation. But the actions are for turns starting from t_1=3, so in the sequence, it will be turn t_1, t_1+1, etc.\n\nI should keep time relative to t_1. So let τ = t - t_1, so at τ=0, turn t_1, position (0,2).\n\nAt turn T = t_1 + τ, for τ >=0.\n\nBut to make it easier, I'll define time steps starting from step 0: at step k, it corresponds to turn t_1 + k.\n\nSo for k=0, turn t_1, position y=2.\n\nAfter action a_k, we move to y_{k+1} for step k+1.\n\nThe target is to reach y=9 at some step H, so after H steps, y_H =9.\n\nMinimal H.\n\nNow, cars: for each freeway, we have cars with their positions at t_1.\n\nFor a car, at turn T = t_1 + τ, the span changes based on speed and direction.\n\nSince the span must include 0 for collision, I need to find when for each freeway, at what times τ, there is a car whose span includes 0.\n\nThen, for the player, at step k (which is turn t_1 + k), we are on y_k, and we need that for y_k, at that turn, no car on that freeway has span including 0.\n\ny_k is the freeway level at turn t_1 + k.\n\nLet me list all freeways: y=1 to 8.\n\nFor each, the cars:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (96,49, right, 48)\n\nDirection right, so it's moving right, meaning increasing x? But since we're only concerned with x=0, and the span, I think x is the horizontal axis, but we're at (0,y), so only care about when the car covers x=0.\n\nThe span is given as [head, tail] or [tail, head] depending on direction.\n\nFor right-moving, head is the front, so for right-moving, span is [tail, head] with tail < head, and it moves right, so positions increase.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, head is front, tail is back, and since moving left, positions decrease.\n\nIn the car update:\n\nLeft-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s (T-t1), τ - s (T-t1)]\n\nSince moving left, decreasing x.\n\nAnd for collision, we care about whether 0 is in [h - s τ, τ - s τ] for τ = T - t1.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: y=1\n\nCars: (96,49, right, 48)\n\nSince right-moving, at time τ after t1, span is [τ + s τ, h + s τ]? Let's see.\n\nGeneral: for right-moving, Span(T) = [τ + s (T-t1), h + s (T-t1)] because it says: for right, Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s (T-t1), h + s (T-t1)]\n\nIn the table: for freeway 1, it says (96,49, right, 48). I think the head and tail are given.\n\nIn the car state: \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nSo for freeway 1: head=96, tail=49, direction=right, speed=48.\n\nSince right-moving, at t1, span is [tail, head] = [49,96]\n\nThen at T, Span(T) = [49 + s (T-t1), 96 + s (T-t1)] with s=48.\n\nWe need 0 in [49 + 48 τ, 96 + 48 τ] for some τ.\n\nSince 49 + 48τ <= 96 + 48τ, and both increase, 0 in this interval only if 49 + 48τ <= 0 and 96 + 48τ >=0? No.\n\n0 in [a,b] means a <= 0 <= b.\n\nSo here a = 49 + 48τ, b=96 + 48τ.\n\na = 49 + 48τ >0 for all τ >=0, since min at τ=0 is 49>0. So a >0, so 0 < a <= b, so 0 not in [a,b] since a>0. Thus for freeway 1, the car never covers x=0 for any T >= t1, because the span starts at 49 and moves right, so it's always positive and increasing, never reaches 0.\n\nSimilarly, since only one car, and it's always away, so freeway 1 is always safe. No collision possible on y=1.\n\nIs that right? At τ=0, [49,96], 49>0, so 0 not included. As τ increases, it moves away, so yes, freeway 1 is safe at all times.\n\nNow freeway 2: y=2\n\nCars: (60,49, right, 4), (24,13, right, 4), (-12,-23, right, 4)\n\nAll right-moving, speed 4.\n\nFirst car: head=60, tail=49, right, s=4\n\nAt τ, span: [49 + 4τ, 60 + 4τ]\n\na=49+4τ >0 for τ>=0, so 0 not in [49+4τ,60+4τ]\n\nSecond car: head=24, tail=13, right, s=4\n\nSpan: [13+4τ, 24+4τ]\n\nAt τ=0, [13,24], 13>0, so 0 not in. Always positive, increasing, so never covers 0.\n\nThird car: head=-12? tail=-23, right, s=4\n\nHead is -12, tail is -23? But for right-moving, tail should be less than head, but -23 < -12, yes.\n\nSpan: [τ + s τ, h + s τ] = [-23 + 4τ, -12 + 4τ]\n\nNow, 0 in [-23+4τ, -12+4τ] when -23+4τ <= 0 and -12+4τ >=0.\n\nSo -23+4τ <=0 => 4τ <=23 => τ <= 23/4 = 5.75\n\nAnd -12+4τ >=0 => 4τ >=12 => τ >=3\n\nSo for τ between 3 and 5.75, inclusive? τ integer? Turns are discrete, so τ integer.\n\nτ >=0 integer.\n\nSo τ=3,4,5\n\nAt τ=3: [-23+12, -12+12] = [-11,0], 0 is included? -11 <=0 <=0, yes, 0 is in [-11,0].\n\n[ -11, 0 ], since it includes endpoints, yes 0 is included.\n\nAt τ=4: [-23+16, -12+16] = [-7,4], -7<=0<=4, yes.\n\nAt τ=5: [-23+20, -12+20] = [-3,8], yes.\n\nAt τ=6: [-23+24, -12+24] = [1,12], 1>0, so 0 not <=1? 0 <1, not in [1,12], since 1>0.\n\nSimilarly, τ=2: [-23+8, -12+8] = [-15,-4], both negative, 0 not in.\n\nSo for freeway 2, collision when τ=3,4,5, i.e., at turns t1+3, t1+4, t1+5, there is a car covering x=0.\n\nBut freeway 2 has multiple cars, but only this third one can cover 0.\n\nThe first and second are always away.\n\nSo on freeway 2, unsafe at τ=3,4,5.\n\nSafe otherwise.\n\nNow, at step k=0, which is τ=0, turn t1, position y=2, which is freeway 2.\n\nAt τ=0, is freeway 2 safe? From above, for third car, at τ=0, span [-23,-12], 0 not in, and other cars not covering, so safe at τ=0.\n\nBut for the player, at step k, we are at turn t1+k, so time τ=k.\n\nPosition y_k.\n\nAt turn t1+k, we are on y_k.\n\nFor freeway 2, unsafe when k=3,4,5.\n\nNow freeway 3: y=3\n\nCars: (-36,-47, right, 12), (36,25, right, 12)\n\nBoth right-moving, s=12.\n\nFirst car: head=-36, tail=-47? tail=-47, head=-36, since right, tail < head, -47 < -36.\n\nSpan: [τ + s τ, h + s τ] = [-47 + 12k, -36 + 12k] for k=τ.\n\n0 in [-47+12k, -36+12k] when -47+12k <=0 and -36+12k >=0.\n\n-47+12k <=0 => 12k <=47 => k <= 47/12 ≈ 3.916, so k<=3 since integer? k<=3\n\n12*3=36, 47-36=11, so -47+36= -11? Let's compute:\n\n-47 +12k <=0 => 12k <=47 => k <= 47/12 = 3.916, so k<=3\n\nBut k integer, so for k<=3: at k=3, -47+36= -11, -36+36=0, so [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nk=3: [-47+36, -36+36] = [-11,0], yes 0 in.\n\nk=4: [-47+48, -36+48] = [1,12], 1>0, not include 0.\n\nNow lower bound: -47+12k <=0, for k=3, -11<=0 true, k=4,1>0 false.\n\nUpper bound: -36+12k >=0 => 12k >=36 => k>=3.\n\nSo for k=3, both: -47+36=-11<=0, -36+36=0>=0, so yes.\n\nFor k=2: -47+24= -23 <=0, -36+24= -12 <0? -12 >=0? No, -12 <0, so upper bound negative, so 0 not in [-23,-12].\n\nSimilarly k=1: worse.\n\nk=0: [-47,-36], both neg.\n\nSo only at k=3, 0 in span for first car.\n\nNow second car: head=36, tail=25, right, s=12\n\nSpan: [25+12k, 36+12k]\n\n25+12k >=25>0, so never <=0, always positive, so 0 not in, safe.\n\nThus on freeway 3, only unsafe at k=3, when first car covers 0.\n\nk=τ=3.\n\nNow freeway 4: y=4\n\nCars: (-36,-47, right, 12), (36,25, right, 12) — same as freeway 3?\n\nIn table: freeway 4 same as freeway 3: (-36,-47, right, 12), (36,25, right, 12)\n\nIdentical to freeway 3.\n\nSo similarly, unsafe only at k=3.\n\nFreeway 5: y=5\n\nCars: (-30,-41, right, 6), (18,7, right, 6)\n\nFirst car: head=-30, tail=-41, right, s=6\n\nSpan: [-41 +6k, -30 +6k]\n\n0 in [-41+6k, -30+6k] when -41+6k <=0 and -30+6k >=0\n\n-41+6k <=0 => 6k <=41 => k <= 41/6 ≈6.833, so k<=6\n\n-30+6k >=0 => 6k >=30 => k>=5\n\nSo for k=5,6\n\nAt k=5: [-41+30, -30+30] = [-11,0], 0 in\n\nk=6: [-41+36, -30+36] = [-5,6], 0 in\n\nk=7: [-41+42, -30+42] = [1,12], not\n\nSecond car: head=18, tail=7, right, s=6\n\nSpan: [7+6k, 18+6k] >0 always, safe.\n\nSo freeway 5 unsafe at k=5,6.\n\nNow freeway 6: y=6\n\nCars: (-24,-1, left, 24) — only one car? head=-24, tail=-1? But direction left.\n\nFor left-moving, how is span defined.\n\nCar update: left-moving, Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s (T-t1), τ - s (T-t1)]\n\nIn the state, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed)\n\nFor left-moving, at t1, span is [head, tail], but since moving left, head should be greater than tail? Let's see.\n\nExample: for left-moving, Span(t1) = [h, τ], and it moves left, so positions decrease.\n\nIn this case, freeway 6: head=-24, tail=-1, left, s=24.\n\nBut head=-24, tail=-1, so if head is front, and moving left, front should be at higher x if x increases right? I think there might be confusion in coordinates.\n\nPerhaps head and tail are positions, with head being the front.\n\nFor left-moving, front is at higher x, back at lower x, so if moving left, head > tail.\n\nHere head=-24, tail=-1, but -24 < -1, so tail=-1 is greater than head=-24? That doesn't make sense.\n\n-1 > -24, so if tail=-1, head=-24, then tail > head, which for left-moving should have head > tail.\n\nInconsistency.\n\nLook at the update rule.\n\nFor left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] and then Span(T) = [h - s τ, τ - s τ] with τ=T-t1.\n\nNow, if h and τ are positions, for left-moving, h should be the position of head, τ position of tail, and since moving left, h decreases, τ decreases.\n\nBut in the span [h, τ], it could be that h and τ are not ordered, but the interval might be from min to max or something? But in the notation, it says \"head h, tail τ\", and for left-moving, Span(t1) = [h, τ], which might not be sorted.\n\nIn the car update, for left-moving, it says Span(T) = [h - s (T-t1), τ - s (T-t1)], which is a set, but for the interval, we need to know min and max.\n\nActually, since it's a span, it should be the continuous interval, so [min, max] or something.\n\nBut in the collision, we care if 0 is in the interval, so we need the actual min and max positions.\n\nFor left-moving, if the car is moving left, the head is at higher x, tail at lower x, so at t1, positions from tail to head with tail < head.\n\nThen Span(t1) = [tail, head]? But the update says for left-moving, Span(t1) = [h, τ], which might be [head, tail], but if head is higher, it could be [tail, head] if tail< head.\n\nI think there's ambiguity.\n\nLet's look at the update rule carefully.\n\nFor left-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s (T-t1), τ - s (T-t1)]\"\n\nNow, since it's moving left, both positions decrease.\n\nThe span is from min to max of these two points.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving.\n\nIn the case of freeway 6: head=-24, tail=-1, left, s=24.\n\nNow, at t1, positions: head at -24, tail at -1.\n\nSince moving left, head is the front, so at higher x? -24 is less than -1, so if x increases to the right, -24 is left of -1, so if moving left, decreasing x, front should be at higher x, but here head=-24 < tail=-1, so head is left of tail, which is inconsistent if tail is the back.\n\nPerhaps \"tail\" means the end of the car, but not specified which end.\n\nTo avoid confusion, let's use the span directly.\n\nAt t1, for this car, positions given as head=-24, tail=-1, but since left-moving, and head is front, it should be that at t1, front at -1, back at -24? But the values are given as (head, tail), so head=-24, tail=-1.\n\nBut numerically, -24 < -1, so the left end is -24, right end is -1.\n\nSince moving left, the car is facing left, so front is at the left end? I think I need to clarify the coordinate system.\n\nAssume x-axis with positive to the right.\n\nIf a car is moving left, its front (head) is at a higher x position, and back (tail) at lower x.\n\nFor example, if head at 10, tail at 5, moving left, then span [5,10] at t1, then at T, [5 - sτ, 10 - sτ], so min decreases, max decreases.\n\nBut in freeway 6, head=-24, tail=-1, so head=-24, tail=-1, so since head < tail, it means the head is at lower x, which is inconsistent for left-moving.\n\nPerhaps the values are positions, and for left-moving, head is at the position given, tail at position given, and the span is from min to max.\n\nIn this case, at t1, positions -24 and -1, so min is -24, max is -1, so span [-24,-1].\n\nThen moving left, so both decrease, so Span(T) = [-24 - sτ, -1 - sτ] with s=24.\n\nSimilarly, for collision, 0 in this interval.\n\nSo for freeway 6 car: head=-24, tail=-1, left, s=24\n\nAt τ, Span(T) = [ -24 -24τ, -1 -24τ ]\n\nSince moving left, positions decrease.\n\nMin position: min of head and tail, but head and tail are both decreasing, but the span is between the two points.\n\nSince -24 < -1, the left end is -24, right end is -1, so as it moves left, both decrease, so the span is [ -24 -24τ, -1 -24τ ]\n\n0 in [ -24-24τ, -1-24τ ]\n\nThis is a decreasing interval.\n\n0 in it when -24-24τ <= 0 and -1-24τ >= 0? No.\n\nThe interval [L, R] with L = -24-24τ, R = -1-24τ\n\nL <= R since -24-24τ < -1-24τ for all τ.\n\n0 in [L,R] if L <= 0 <= R.\n\nSo L <=0 and R >=0.\n\nL = -24-24τ <=0 => -24-24τ <=0 => -24τ <=24 => multiply by -1, reverse inequality, 24τ >= -24? Better: -24 -24τ <=0 => -24τ <=24 => divide by -24, reverse: τ >= -1, but τ>=0, so always true? -24 -24τ <=0 for all τ>=0? At τ=0, -24<=0 true; τ large, more negative, true.\n\nL = -24-24τ, which is always <= -24 <0, so L <=0 always true for τ>=0.\n\nR = -1-24τ >=0? -1-24τ >=0 => -24τ >=1 => τ <= -1/24, impossible since τ>=0.\n\nR = -1-24τ <= -1 <0 for all τ>=0, so R <0 always.\n\nThus 0 > R, so 0 not in [L,R] since R<0 and L< R<0, so entire interval negative, 0 not in.\n\nSo this car never covers x=0.\n\nBut there's only one car on freeway 6? In the table: \"(-24,-1, left, 24)\" for freeway 6.\n\nAnd similarly for freeway 7.\n\nBut let's confirm freeway 6.\n\nFreeway 6: cars: (-24,-1, left, 24)\n\nAs above, span always negative, so never covers 0. So freeway 6 is always safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 7: y=7\n\nCars: (-24,-1, left, 24) — same as above, so always safe.\n\nNow freeway 8: y=8\n\nCars: (-60,-25, left, 36)\n\nHead=-60, tail=-25, left, s=36\n\nAt t1, positions: min=-60, max=-25, span [-60,-25]\n\nMoving left, Span(T) = [ -60 -36τ, -25 -36τ ]\n\nL = -60-36τ <= -60 <0 always\n\nR = -25-36τ <= -25 <0 always\n\nSo always negative, never covers 0. Safe always.\n\nBut freeway 8 has this car, but never at 0.\n\nNow, summarize safety per freeway over time k (τ):\n\n- y=1: always safe (no car covers 0)\n\n- y=2: unsafe at k=3,4,5\n\n- y=3: unsafe at k=3\n\n- y=4: unsafe at k=3 (same as y=3)\n\n- y=5: unsafe at k=5,6\n\n- y=6: always safe\n\n- y=7: always safe\n\n- y=8: always safe\n\ny=9 is the target, no cars, always safe.\n\nNow, player starts at y=2 at k=0.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nActions: U (up +1), D (down -1), S (stay).\n\ny must be in 0 to 9.\n\nMinimal H to reach y=9.\n\nSince we start at y=2, need to go up to y=9, difference 7, so minimum 7 steps if we always go up, but we have to avoid the unsafe times on certain levels.\n\nAt k=0, y=2, which is safe since at τ=0, y=2 safe as per above.\n\nNow, unsafe times:\n\ny=2 unsafe at k=3,4,5\n\ny=3 unsafe at k=3\n\ny=4 unsafe at k=3\n\ny=5 unsafe at k=5,6\n\ny=6,7,8 always safe.\n\ny=1 also safe, but we might not need to go down.\n\nNow, to minimize H, we should go up as fast as possible, but avoid being on unsafe levels at unsafe times.\n\nStart at k=0, y=2.\n\nWe need to plan the sequence.\n\nSince y=6,7,8 are always safe, if we can reach y=6 quickly, then we can go up fast to 9.\n\nBut we have to pass through y=3,4,5 which have unsafe times.\n\nSpecifically, y=3 and y=4 are unsafe only at k=3, and y=5 unsafe at k=5,6.\n\ny=2 unsafe at k=3,4,5.\n\nNow, at k=0, y=2, safe.\n\nWe can choose action: U, D, or S.\n\nIf we go up to y=3 at k=1.\n\nAt k=1, turn t1+1, position y=3.\n\nNow, at time k=1, τ=1, is y=3 safe?\n\nFrom above, y=3 unsafe only at k=3, so at k=1, it should be safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=4 unsafe only at k=3.\n\ny=5 unsafe at k=5,6.\n\nBut let's list for each k, which y are unsafe.\n\nFor k=0: τ=0\n\ny=2: safe (as earlier)\n\ny=3: safe (only unsafe at k=3)\n\ny=4: safe\n\ny=5: safe (unsafe at k=5,6)\n\ny=6: safe\n\netc.\n\nk=1: τ=1\n\ny=2: at k=1, τ=1, for y=2, unsafe only at k=3,4,5, so k=1 safe.\n\ny=3: unsafe only k=3, so safe.\n\nSimilarly all safe except possibly, but y=2 unsafe starts k=3.\n\nk=2: similar, all safe.\n\nk=3: τ=3\n\ny=2: unsafe (k=3)\n\ny=3: unsafe (k=3)\n\ny=4: unsafe (k=3)\n\ny=5: safe (unsafe k=5,6)\n\ny=6: safe\n\netc.\n\nk=4: τ=4\n\ny=2: unsafe (k=4)\n\ny=3: safe (only unsafe k=3)\n\ny=4: safe\n\ny=5: safe\n\nBut y=2 unsafe k=4.\n\nk=5: τ=5\n\ny=2: unsafe (k=5)\n\ny=3: safe\n\ny=4: safe\n\ny=5: unsafe (k=5)\n\ny=6: safe\n\nk=6: τ=6\n\ny=2: unsafe? y=2 unsafe at k=3,4,5, so k=6 safe? k=3,4,5 unsafe for y=2.\n\nAt k=6, τ=6, for y=2, the car that causes issue is only at k=3,4,5, so at k=6, safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=5 unsafe at k=5,6, so at k=6 unsafe.\n\ny=5 unsafe k=5 and 6.\n\nNow, back to the player.\n\nStart: k=0, y=2, safe.\n\nWe want to reach y=9 quickly.\n\nIf we go up every step, we can reach y=9 in 7 steps: from y=2 to y=9, delta=7, so after 7 actions, y=9 at step 7.\n\nBut we need to check if during the path, we are safe at each step.\n\nSequence with all U:\n\nk=0: y=2, action U, to y=3\n\nAt k=0, position y=2, safe.\n\nAfter action U, at k=1, position y=3.\n\nk=1: position y=3, is it safe? At time k=1, τ=1, y=3 safe (only unsafe k=3)\n\nAction U, to y=4\n\nk=2: position y=4, time k=2, safe (y=4 unsafe only k=3)\n\nAction U, to y=5\n\nk=3: position y=5, time k=3.\n\ny=5 at k=3: from above, y=5 unsafe only at k=5,6, so at k=3, y=5 is safe.\n\nBut at k=3, we are on y=5.\n\ny=5 unsafe at k=5,6, so at k=3, it is safe.\n\nAction U, to y=6\n\nk=4: position y=6, time k=4. y=6 always safe. Action U, to y=7\n\nk=5: position y=7, time k=5. y=7 always safe. Action U, to y=8\n\nk=6: position y=8, time k=6. safe. Action U, to y=9\n\nk=7: position y=9, reached.\n\nNow, at each step, was it safe?\n\nk=0: y=2, safe\n\nk=1: y=3, safe (since unsafe only k=3)\n\nk=2: y=4, safe (unsafe only k=3)\n\nk=3: y=5, safe (unsafe k=5,6)\n\nk=4: y=6, safe\n\nk=5: y=7, safe\n\nk=6: y=8, safe\n\nk=7: y=9, safe\n\nAll good, and H=7.\n\nBut is this minimal? We start from y=2, to y=9, minimum 7 steps if always up.\n\nBut perhaps we can do in less? If we stay or something, but that would take more steps, so 7 is minimum possible.\n\nBut in this case, with all U, we avoided the unsafe times.\n\nFor example, at k=3, we were on y=5, which is safe, while y=2,3,4 are unsafe at k=3.\n\nSimilarly, at k=5, we were on y=7, safe, while y=5 is unsafe.\n\nSo it works.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), and we did in 7 steps.\n\nBut let me confirm the actions.\n\nAt turn t1 (k=0), position (0,2), action a_{t1} = U\n\nThen at k=1, position (0,3), action U\n\nk=2, (0,4), action U\n\nk=3, (0,5), action U\n\nk=4, (0,6), action U\n\nk=5, (0,7), action U\n\nk=6, (0,8), action U\n\nk=7, (0,9), done.\n\nH=7 turns? From k=0 to k=7, that's 8 positions, but actions from k=0 to k=6, 7 actions, and after 7 actions, at step k=7, y=9.\n\nThe sequence of actions is for t from t1 to t1+H-1, so H actions.\n\nIn this case, actions at turns: t1, t1+1, ..., t1+6, total 7 actions, reach at turn t1+7 position y=9? Let's clarify.\n\nAt turn T, before action, position is y_T.\n\nAfter action a_T, position becomes y_{T+1}.\n\nWe start at turn t1, position y_{t1} = 2.\n\nAfter action a_{t1}, position y_{t1+1}.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t1+H, position y_{t1+H}.\n\nWe want y_{t1+H} = 9.\n\nIn terms of steps: let s be the number of actions.\n\nAfter s actions, we are at turn t1+s, position y_{t1+s}.\n\nSet y_{t1+s} =9.\n\nMinimal s.\n\ns=7 possible as above.\n\nIn the sequence above, after 7 actions, at turn t1+7, y=9.\n\nNow, during the turns t1 to t1+6, we are at positions:\n\nAt turn t1 (before action), position y=2.\n\nAfter action U, at turn t1+1, position y=3.\n\nSimilarly:\n\nTurn t1+1: position y=3 (after action at t1)\n\nBetter to list for each turn, the position and the action.\n\nTurn T | position at T | action a_T | position after action (for next turn)\n\nBut collision depends on position at turn T, before action.\n\nAt turn T, position y_T, then we perform action a_T, then move to y_{T+1}.\n\nCollision at turn T if on freeway y_T, and car there has 0 in span at turn T.\n\nIn our case, for turn t1+k, position y_k.\n\nIn the all U plan:\n\nAt turn t1+0: position y=2, safe, action U → position y=3 for next turn.\n\nAt turn t1+1: position y=3, safe (since k=1, not unsafe time), action U → y=4\n\nAt turn t1+2: position y=4, safe (k=2), action U → y=5\n\nAt turn t1+3: position y=5, now k=3, turn t1+3, position y=5. Is it safe? y=5 unsafe at k=5 and k=6, not k=3, so safe. Action U → y=6\n\nAt turn t1+4: position y=6, safe, action U → y=7\n\nAt turn t1+5: position y=7, safe, action U → y=8\n\nAt turn t1+6: position y=8, safe, action U → y=9\n\nNow at turn t1+7: position y=9, which is the target, but we don't need an action here; we reach after the last action.\n\nThe sequence has actions from t1 to t1+6, 7 actions.\n\nAt turn t1+7, position is 9, no action needed.\n\nIn the answer, we list actions from turn t1 to t1+H-1, with H=7.\n\nBut is there a way with H=6? Then from y=2 to y=9 in 6 steps, but with moves, maximum we can go up 6 steps, to y=8, not 9. Since each U only +1, from 2 to 9 is 7 steps minimum. If we can go faster, but the moves are only ±1 or 0, so no, minimum 7 actions.\n\nSo H=7 is minimal.\n\nBut in this sequence, it seems fine, but let me double-check if at any point we are unsafe.\n\nSpecifically, at turn t1+3: k=3, position y=5.\n\ny=5 is unsafe only at k=5 and k=6, so at k=3, safe.\n\nSimilarly, other points safe.\n\nBut at k=5, we are on y=7, which is safe, while y=5 is unsafe, but we are not on it.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nBut earlier I thought y=2 unsafe at k=3,4,5, but in this path, at k=3, we are on y=5, not y=2.\n\nSimilarly, at k=4, y=6, safe.\n\nk=5, y=7, safe.\n\nSo all good.\n\nBut the player starts at (0,2) at turn t1=3.\n\nIn the car states, at turn t1, we have the positions.\n\nIn the sequence, we reached in 7 actions.\n\nBut let me confirm the freeway 5 at k=3.\n\nFreeway 5: unsafe at k=5,6, so at k=3, safe, yes.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if we can reach faster, but impossible.\n\nMaybe by staying or down, but that would only take more turns, so no benefit.\n\nFor example, if at some point we have to avoid, but in this case, not necessary.\n\nBut just to be thorough, suppose we try to go down to y=1 or something, but y=1 is safe, but it's lower, so it would take more steps to go up, so worse.\n\nSimilarly, staying would delay.\n\nSo the all U sequence should work.\n\nBut in the car for freeway 2, at k=3,4,5 unsafe, but we leave y=2 early.\n\nAt k=0, we are on y=2, safe, and we go up immediately.\n\nNow, the answer should be the sequence of actions.\n\nH=7, actions: all U for 7 steps.\n\nBut let's write in the format.\n\nTurn t_1: U\n\nTurn t_1 +1: U\n\n...\n\nUp to Turn t_1 +6: U\n\nSince t_1=3, but we don't need the value, just the relative.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut is there any mistake?\n\nFreeway 4: we passed y=4 at k=2, which is safe.\n\ny=4 unsafe only at k=3.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut freeway 4 has cars same as y=3, unsafe at k=3.\n\nAt k=2, we are on y=4, safe.\n\nPerhaps I should list the unsafe times again.\n\nTimes k (relative to t1):\n\n- k=3: unsafe y=2,3,4\n\n- k=4: unsafe y=2\n\n- k=5: unsafe y=2 and y=5\n\n- k=6: unsafe y=5\n\nIn our path:\n\nAt k=0: y=2 safe\n\nk=1: y=3 safe\n\nk=2: y=4 safe\n\nk=3: y=5 safe (since not unsafe at k=3)\n\nk=4: y=6 safe\n\nk=5: y=7 safe\n\nk=6: y=8 safe\n\nThen after action, at k=7, y=9.\n\nAll safe.\n\nPerhaps we can start with S or D, but that would not help, since we need to go up.\n\nFor example, if at k=0, we do S, then at k=1 still y=2, but at k=1, y=2 safe, but we wasted a turn.\n\nSimilarly, D to y=1, then need more steps.\n\nSo worse.\n\nThus minimal is 7 with all U.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\", but in this case H=7.\n\nBut let me check if at turn t1+3, position y=5 is indeed safe.\n\nFreeway 5: cars at t1: (-30,-41, right,6) and (18,7,right,6)\n\nAt turn T= t1 + k, with k=3.\n\nT = t1 +3.\n\nFor first car, right-moving, head=-30, tail=-41? tail=-41, head=-30.\n\nSpan at T: [tail + s k, head + s k] = [-41 +6*3, -30 +6*3] = [-41+18, -30+18] = [-23, -12]\n\nNow, 0 in [-23,-12]? -23 <=0 <= -12? 0 >= -12 false, -12 <=0? -12 <0, and 0 > -12, but since -12 <=0 is false, 0 not <= -12? The interval [-23,-12], so min=-23, max=-12, both negative, so 0 not in, since 0 > -12.\n\nSimilarly, second car [7+18,18+18]? [7+6*3,18+6*3]=[7+18,18+18]=[25,36] not include 0.\n\nSo safe.\n\nAt k=5, if we were on y=5, unsafe, but we are not.\n\nIn our path, at k=5, we are on y=7.\n\ny=7 has cars? Freeway 7: (-24,-1,left,24), which we saw never covers 0, so safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo all good.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is all U for 7 actions.\n\nBut the answer should be in the box.\n\nBut H=7, and actions from turn t1 to t1+6.\n\nNow, since t1=3, but we don't need to specify, just the actions.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn t_1: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 2: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 3: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 4: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 5: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 6: U\n\nAnd that's it.\n\nBut the player reaches (0,9) at turn t_1 +7, after the last action.\n\nBut the sequence has H=7 actions.\n\nIn the problem: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" so t from 0 to H-1.\n\nIn the answer format, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc.\n\nSo for H=7, actions at t_1, t_1+1, ..., t_1+6.\n\nNow, I think that's fine.\n\nBut just to be thorough, is there a sequence with H=6? Impossible, since from y=2 to y=9, min 7 steps.\n\nUnless we can move faster, but no, only +1 per up.\n\nSo H=7 is minimal.\n\nPerhaps by using down or stay to avoid something, but in this case, not necessary, and would increase H.\n\nSo I think this is correct.\n</think>\nThe goal is to reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 2) at turn \\(t_1 = 3\\) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\), avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\). Collision occurs only if, at turn \\(T\\), the player is on freeway \\(y_T\\) and a car on that freeway has a span that includes \\(x = 0\\).\n\n### Analysis of Car Movements and Safe Freeways\nThe safety of each freeway over time (relative to \\(t_1\\)) is determined by whether any car covers \\(x = 0\\) at turn \\(t_1 + k\\) for \\(k \\geq 0\\):\n- **Freeway 1 (y=1)**: Always safe (no car covers \\(x=0\\)).\n- **Freeway 2 (y=2)**: Unsafe at \\(k=3,4,5\\) (due to a car covering \\(x=0\\)).\n- **Freeway 3 (y=3)**: Unsafe at \\(k=3\\) (due to a car covering \\(x=0\\)).\n- **Freeway 4 (y=4)**: Unsafe at \\(k=3\\) (due to a car covering \\(x=0\\)).\n- **Freeway 5 (y=5)**: Unsafe at \\(k=5,6\\) (due to a car covering \\(x=0\\)).\n- **Freeway 6 (y=6)**: Always safe (no car covers \\(x=0\\)).\n- **Freeway 7 (y=7)**: Always safe (no car covers \\(x=0\\)).\n- **Freeway 8 (y=8)**: Always safe (no car covers \\(x=0\\)).\n- **Freeway 9 (y=9)**: Always safe (no cars).\n\nThe player starts at \\(y=2\\) at \\(k=0\\) (turn \\(t_1\\)). To reach \\(y=9\\), a minimum of 7 actions are required since each \"U\" action increases \\(y\\) by 1, and \\(9 - 2 = 7\\).\n\n### Optimal Sequence\nThe sequence of all \"U\" (up) actions achieves the goal in \\(H=7\\) turns without collisions:\n- At each turn, the player moves up, increasing \\(y\\) by 1.\n- The path avoids unsafe freeways at unsafe times:\n  - At \\(k=3\\) (turn \\(t_1 + 3\\)), the player is at \\(y=5\\), which is safe (freeway 5 is unsafe only at \\(k=5,6\\)).\n  - At \\(k=5\\) and \\(k=6\\), the player is at \\(y=7\\) and \\(y=8\\), which are always safe, avoiding the unsafe freeway 5.\n- All other positions are safe at their respective times.\n\nThe sequence of actions is:\n- Turn \\(t_1\\): U (move to \\(y=3\\))\n- Turn \\(t_1 + 1\\): U (move to \\(y=4\\))\n- Turn \\(t_1 + 2\\): U (move to \\(y=5\\))\n- Turn \\(t_1 + 3\\): U (move to \\(y=6\\))\n- Turn \\(t_1 + 4\\): U (move to \\(y=7\\))\n- Turn \\(t_1 + 5\\): U (move to \\(y=8\\))\n- Turn \\(t_1 + 6\\): U (move to \\(y=9\\))\n\nAfter 7 actions, at turn \\(t_1 + 7\\), the player reaches \\((0, 9)\\). No shorter sequence is possible due to the stepwise movement constraint.\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } t_1: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 1: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 2: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 3: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 4: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 5: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 6: U }",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 4, and the player is at (0,3). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on freeways 1 to 8.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S). The movement is in the y-direction only, and the x-coordinate is always 0. The collision occurs at turn T if the player is on a freeway y (which is between 1 and 8) and at that turn, the car on that freeway has a span that includes x=0.\n\nImportant: When the player moves from y_T to y_{T+1} at turn T, they are considered to be on freeway y_T during the entire turn T. Therefore, they only check for collision on freeway y_T at turn T. When they move, at the next turn (T+1) they will be on freeway y_{T+1}, so they check for collision on that freeway at turn T+1.\n\nWe are to output a sequence of actions starting from turn t1 (which is 4) for H turns until we reach y=9.\n\nWe note that the grid for y is from 0 to 9. The starting y is 3, and the goal is 9. So we need to go up at least 6 steps. However, we might have to wait (using S or even D) to avoid cars.\n\nThe cars are given for each freeway (y=1 to 8). Each car is defined by (head, tail, direction, speed). Note that for left-moving cars (d='left'), the car moves to the left, meaning that as time increases, the entire span shifts left (so the head and tail decrease by s*(T-t1) at time T). For right-moving, they shift right (so head and tail increase by s*(T-t1)).\n\nCollision on freeway k at turn T: if the player is on freeway k (i.e., the player's y-coordinate at turn T is k) and the x=0 is within the span of any car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nWe note that the player's position at turn T is (0, y_T). The turn T is relative to the starting turn t1=4. So at the current turn (T=4), we are at y=3.\n\nWe need to simulate from T=4 onward.\n\nWe are to find the minimal H and the sequence of actions.\n\nSince we need minimal H, we want to go up as fast as possible, but we must avoid collisions.\n\nWe note that we can only change by -1,0,1 per turn, and we start at y=3 and need to get to y=9. The minimal steps without any obstacles would be 6 steps of U. But we have obstacles on freeways 1 to 8, and we are currently at freeway 3? Actually, note that the freeways are at y=1,2,...,8. The player is at y=3, which is freeway 3? But note: the collision is checked only when the player is on a freeway. The starting position is at y=3, which is freeway 3. We must avoid being on freeway k (for k=1..8) at a turn when a car on that freeway covers x=0.\n\nWe note that the starting position is (0,3) at turn 4. We are on freeway 3 at turn 4, so we must check the cars on freeway 3 at turn 4.\n\nLet me compute the car positions at turn 4 (current turn) for each freeway that we might traverse.\n\nBut note: we are going to plan a path. We can simulate the car movements as a function of time (in turns) from t1=4.\n\nWe are going to simulate the state for each turn T (starting at T=4) and for each possible y position, but note that we want minimal turns so we can use BFS in terms of (turn, y) but note that the turn is increasing and we are only moving one step per turn.\n\nAlternatively, we can simulate step by step and check for safe moves.\n\nWe must avoid:\n\n- Being on freeway y (1<=y<=8) at turn T if at that turn T, any car on freeway y has a span that includes 0.\n\nWe are given:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (-48, -95, right, 48)\nAt turn 4: \n  head = -48 + 48*(4-4) = -48? But note: the update rule for right-moving: \n  [tau, h] -> [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\nBut the representation is given as (head, tail, direction, speed). For right-moving, the head is the larger coordinate? Actually, note the update rule:\n\nFor right-moving: \n  initial span at t1: [tau, h] meaning from tau to h (with tau < h) and then at T: [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut in the input for freeway 1: (-48, -95, right, 48) -> wait, -48 and -95? and direction right? But note: if the car is moving right, then the tail should be less than the head? Here, -95 is less than -48? Actually, -95 < -48, so the car spans from -95 to -48? Then at T, the span is [ -95 + 48*(T-4), -48 + 48*(T-4) ]\n\nAt T=4: [ -95, -48] -> does this include 0? No, because -95<=x<=-48, which is negative.\n\nFreeway 2: \n  three cars: \n    (-48, -59, right, 4) -> wait, -48 and -59? and direction right? Then the tail is -59 and head is -48? But -59 < -48, so the span is [-59, -48] at T=4? \n  Then at T: [ -59 + 4*(T-4), -48 + 4*(T-4) ]\n\n  Also: (28, 17, right, 4) -> 28 and 17? But 17<28, so the span is [17,28] at T=4? \n  And (-8, -19, right, 4) -> -19 and -8? so [-19, -8] at T=4.\n\nFreeway 3: \n  (-24, -35, right, 12) -> [-35, -24] at T=4? \n  (48, 37, right, 12) -> wait, 48 and 37? but 37<48, so [37,48] at T=4.\n\nBut note: the representation in the input is given as (head, tail, direction, speed). However, the update rule for right-moving says: the span at T is [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]. So we must interpret the given numbers: for a right-moving car, the tail is the smaller coordinate and the head is the larger. But in the input, the first number is called \"head\", but in the example of freeway 2, we have (-48, -59, right, 4): if head is -48 and tail is -59, then indeed tail < head. Similarly, (28,17,right,4): head=28, tail=17 -> tail<head. So we can assume that for right-moving cars, the tail (second number) is the leftmost (smaller) and head (first number) is the rightmost (larger). \n\nSimilarly, for left-moving cars, the update rule: [h, tau] -> [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]. In the input, we have for freeway 6: (-48, -25, left, 24). For left-moving, the head is the leftmost? Actually, the update rule says: at t1, the span is [h, tau] meaning from h to tau? and then moves left. But note: if the car is moving left, then the head (leading part) is on the left? So the head should be the smaller coordinate? \n\nBut in the example: (-48, -25, left, 24): if head=-48 and tail=-25, then at t1: [h, tau] = [-48, -25]? But then the car spans from -48 to -25? and as time increases, the entire span shifts left (decreases). \n\nAt T=4: the car is at [-48, -25]. Then at T: [ -48 - 24*(T-4), -25 -24*(T-4) ]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 7: same as 6? \nFreeway 8: (48,83,left,36): head=48, tail=83 -> but then the car would be from 48 to 83? and moving left? Then at T=4: [48,83]? Then at T: [48 -36*(T-4), 83 -36*(T-4)]\n\nNow, we are at turn 4, and we are on freeway 3. We must check if at turn 4, freeway 3 has a car that covers 0.\n\nFreeway 3 cars:\n  Car1: [-35, -24] -> doesn't cover 0 (since -35 to -24 is negative)\n  Car2: [37,48] -> positive, doesn't cover 0.\n\nSo at turn 4, freeway 3 is safe.\n\nNow, we plan the actions. We start at y=3 at turn 4. We want to get to y=9.\n\nWe can use a BFS-like state: (time, y) where time is the current turn (starting at 4) and y in [0,9]. We want to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nWe'll simulate for each turn, and for each state (time, y), we consider the three actions: U, D, S. Then the next state is (time+1, y') where y' = y + dy (clamped to [0,9]).\n\nBut note: when we are at (time, y), we must check if we are on a freeway (i.e., if y is between 1 and 8) then we check the cars on freeway y at time 'time'. If there is a car that covers 0 at that time, then we cannot be there -> so that state is invalid.\n\nAlso, we start at (4,3) and we know that at turn 4, freeway 3 is safe.\n\nWe will simulate until we get to y=9.\n\nWe must compute for each freeway and for each car the span at any future turn T (>=4).\n\nWe can precompute for each freeway k and for each car on k, the span at turn T: [L(T), R(T)] (for right-moving: L(T) = tail0 + s*(T-4), R(T)=head0+s*(T-4); for left-moving: L(T)= head0 - s*(T-4), R(T)= tail0 - s*(T-4) ? Actually, no: for left-moving, the update rule: [h, tau] -> [h - s*(T-4), tau - s*(T-4)] and note that h < tau? or h>tau? \n\nWait, the update rule for left-moving says: at T, the span is [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]. But the initial representation: for freeway 6: head=-48, tail=-25. Then at T=4: [h, tau] = [-48, -25] -> meaning the car spans from -48 to -25? Then at T, it becomes [ -48 -24*(T-4), -25 -24*(T-4) ]. Since the car moves left, both endpoints decrease. And the span is [L, R] where L is the left end and R is the right end? But note: the car is continuous, so the span is from min(L,R) to max(L,R). Actually, the update rule doesn't change the order? \n\nIn the update rule for left-moving: the span at T is [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]. But if initially h < tau, then after subtracting, we still have h - s*(T-t1) < tau - s*(T-t1). So the span is from h - s*(T-t1) to tau - s*(T-t1). \n\nSimilarly, for right-moving: [tau + s*(T-t1), head + s*(T-t1)] and since tau < head, then the span is from tau+s*(T-t1) to head+s*(T-t1).\n\nSo we can define for each car a function that returns the span at time T: [low, high] where low <= high.\n\nThen, at time T, for freeway k, we check if 0 is in the union of the spans of the cars on freeway k.\n\nBut note: the cars on the same freeway might overlap, but we only care if 0 is covered by at least one.\n\nWe'll precompute for each freeway k and for each car on k, the function of T that gives the span.\n\nHowever, T will be from 4 to ... we don't know how far, but we can compute as we go.\n\nWe are going to simulate turn by turn. Since we want minimal H, we can use BFS (actually Dijkstra, but all steps cost 1) in the state (turn, y). The state space: turn can go up to ... at most 4+ (max steps to go up 6, but might have to wait) so let's say 20 turns? and y in 10 states -> 200 states max.\n\nBut we can do a BFS level by level (by turn).\n\nWe start at (4,3). We mark that as safe (since we are at freeway 3 and we checked it's safe at turn 4).\n\nThen at turn 4, we can choose action: U, D, S.\n\nIf we choose U: then next y = 4 -> at turn 5, we will be at y=4? Actually, at turn 4 we are at y=3. Then we take action U: so at the next turn (turn 5) we will be at y=4. But during turn 4, we are at y=3 (so we only check freeway 3 at turn 4, which we know is safe). Then at turn 5, we will be at y=4, so we must check freeway 4 at turn 5.\n\nSimilarly, if we choose S: at turn 5 we are still at y=3 -> then we check freeway 3 at turn 5.\n\nIf we choose D: at turn 5 we are at y=2 -> then check freeway 2 at turn 5.\n\nWe must compute for each freeway and each turn T (>=4) the car spans.\n\nLet me precompute the car spans for each freeway for a range of turns, say from T=4 to T=20 (since minimal steps is 6, and we might have to wait 14 steps? probably not that long, but we can extend if needed).\n\nBut note: the cars move continuously. The spans are linear functions of T.\n\nWe can write a function for each car that returns the interval [a*T+b, c*T+d] (but actually linear). But note: for each car, we can compute:\n\nFor a right-moving car: \n   low(T) = tail0 + s*(T-4)\n   high(T) = head0 + s*(T-4)\n\nFor a left-moving car:\n   low(T) = head0 - s*(T-4)\n   high(T) = tail0 - s*(T-4)\n\nThen for a given T, we can check if 0 is in [low(T), high(T)] for any car.\n\nBut note: the representation for the car on freeway 1: (-48, -95, right, 48) -> \n  head0 = -48, tail0 = -95? \n  Then for right-moving: \n      low(T) = -95 + 48*(T-4)\n      high(T) = -48 + 48*(T-4)\n\nWe can compute for each freeway k, for each car, and for each T, whether 0 is in the interval.\n\nBut note: we don't need to precompute for all T, we can compute on the fly.\n\nNow, we'll do BFS:\n\nLet's define a queue: each element is (turn, y, path_actions) where path_actions is the sequence of actions taken from turn 4 to this state.\n\nWe start: (4, 3, [])\n\nThen we expand:\n\nAt state (turn, y), we consider actions for the current turn. The actions are taken at the current turn, and then we move to the next state at turn+1 and y' = y + delta.\n\nBut note: when we are in state (turn, y), we are at turn 'turn', so we must check if y is in [1,8] (freeway) then check the cars on freeway y at turn 'turn'. If it is safe, then we can stay and choose an action. If not safe, then we cannot be at (turn, y) at all.\n\nIn our BFS, we only enqueue safe states.\n\nWe start at (4,3): we check freeway 3 at turn4 -> safe, so we enqueue.\n\nThen from (4,3), we can do:\n\n  Action U: then next state: turn=5, y=4. Then we check at turn=5, if y=4 is safe? That is, if freeway 4 at turn5 has no car covering 0.\n\n  Action S: next state: turn=5, y=3 -> check freeway3 at turn5.\n\n  Action D: next state: turn=5, y=2 -> check freeway2 at turn5.\n\nWe compute:\n\nFreeway 4 at turn5: \n  Cars: two cars (same as freeway3? no, freeway4: \n      (-24, -35, right, 12) -> so tail0=-35, head0=-24? \n        low(5) = -35 + 12*(5-4) = -35+12 = -23\n        high(5) = -24 + 12 = -12 -> so [-23,-12] -> doesn't cover 0.\n\n      (48,37,right,12) -> head0=48, tail0=37? \n        low(5)=37+12=49, high(5)=48+12=60 -> [49,60] -> doesn't cover 0.\n\n  So freeway4 at turn5 is safe.\n\nFreeway3 at turn5:\n  Cars: \n      (-24,-35,right,12): \n          low(5)= -35+12=-23, high(5)=-24+12=-12 -> [-23,-12] -> safe.\n      (48,37,right,12): \n          low(5)=37+12=49, high(5)=48+12=60 -> safe.\n  So freeway3 at turn5 is safe.\n\nFreeway2 at turn5:\n  Cars: \n      (-48,-59,right,4): \n          low(5)= -59 + 4*(1) = -55, high(5)= -48+4=-44 -> [-55,-44] -> safe.\n      (28,17,right,4): \n          low(5)=17+4=21, high(5)=28+4=32 -> [21,32] -> safe.\n      (-8,-19,right,4): \n          low(5)= -19+4=-15, high(5)=-8+4=-4 -> [-15,-4] -> safe.\n  So freeway2 at turn5 is safe.\n\nTherefore, from (4,3) we can go to (5,4), (5,3), (5,2) all safe.\n\nNow, we mark (5,4), (5,3), (5,2) as visited? But we might come back to the same y at a later turn? But we are minimizing the turn, so if we get to the same y at an earlier turn, that's better. However, if we get to the same y at the same turn, we don't need to revisit. So we can use a visited set: (turn, y). We want the minimal turn to reach y=9.\n\nWe'll do a BFS by increasing turn.\n\nWe'll keep a queue of (turn, y, path) and a visited set for (turn,y) to avoid duplicates.\n\nBut note: we might have the same (turn,y) from different paths? But if we have the same (turn,y) and we are doing BFS, we only need to consider one path because we are looking for minimal steps. And at the same turn and y, the future is the same.\n\nSo we mark visited states as (turn, y).\n\nWe proceed:\n\nLevel 0: (4,3) -> path = []\n\nLevel 1 (turn=5): \n   states: (5,4), (5,3), (5,2)\n\nFrom each of these, we generate next states for turn=6.\n\nBut note: we are at turn=5 and we are at y=4,3, or 2. We must check that at turn=5, the state is safe? Actually, we already did that when we generated them.\n\nNow, for each state at turn=5, we consider actions.\n\nWe'll simulate:\n\nState (5,4): \n   Actions: U -> y=5 -> next state (6,5)\n            S -> y=4 -> (6,4)\n            D -> y=3 -> (6,3)\n\n   We must check at turn=5, we are at freeway4? -> already checked at generation: we know it's safe? Actually, when we generated (5,4) we checked freeway4 at turn5? Yes, we did: freeway4 at turn5 is safe. So we can take actions.\n\n   Then for the next state at turn=6, we must check the freeway at turn6 for the next y.\n\n   For (6,5): check freeway5 at turn6.\n   For (6,4): check freeway4 at turn6.\n   For (6,3): check freeway3 at turn6.\n\nSimilarly for (5,3) and (5,2).\n\nBut note: we are generating next states at turn=6, so we must check the freeway condition at turn=6 for the next y.\n\nWe must compute:\n\nFreeway5 at turn6:\n   Cars: \n        (-24, -35, right, 6) -> wait, freeway5 has two cars: \n            (-24, -35, right, 6) -> tail0=-35, head0=-24 -> \n                low(6)= -35 + 6*(6-4)= -35+12 = -23\n                high(6)= -24+12 = -12 -> safe.\n            (24,13,right,6) -> tail0=13, head0=24? \n                low(6)=13+6*2=25, high(6)=24+12=36 -> safe.\n\nFreeway4 at turn6:\n   Cars: \n        (-24,-35,right,12): \n            low(6)= -35+12*2 = -35+24=-11, high(6)=-24+24=0 -> [ -11, 0 ] -> does it cover 0? yes, because high(6)=0 -> so 0 is included? \n            But note: the car spans from -11 to 0, so 0 is included? \n            However, the update rule: the car spans from low to high, inclusive? The problem says: collision occurs if 0 is in the span. So 0 is in [-11,0] -> so freeway4 at turn6 is unsafe.\n\n        (48,37,right,12): \n            low(6)=37+24=61, high(6)=48+24=72 -> safe.\n\n   Therefore, freeway4 at turn6 is unsafe.\n\nFreeway3 at turn6:\n   Cars: \n        (-24,-35,right,12): \n            low(6)= -35+24=-11, high(6)=-24+24=0 -> again [ -11, 0 ] -> unsafe.\n        (48,37,right,12): \n            low(6)=37+24=61, safe.\n   So unsafe.\n\nSo from state (5,4) we cannot go to (6,4) or (6,3) because freeway4 and freeway3 at turn6 are unsafe. But we can go to (6,5) because freeway5 at turn6 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, for state (5,3) at turn5: \n   We are at freeway3 at turn5 -> already checked safe at generation.\n   Then actions:\n        U: (6,4) -> but freeway4 at turn6 unsafe -> discard.\n        S: (6,3) -> freeway3 at turn6 unsafe -> discard.\n        D: (6,2) -> check freeway2 at turn6.\n\nFreeway2 at turn6:\n   Cars: \n        (-48,-59,right,4): \n            low(6)= -59+4*(6-4)= -59+8=-51, high(6)=-48+8=-40 -> safe.\n        (28,17,right,4): \n            low(6)=17+8=25, high(6)=28+8=36 -> safe.\n        (-8,-19,right,4): \n            low(6)= -19+8=-11, high(6)=-8+8=0 -> [-11,0] -> covers 0 -> unsafe.\n\n   So freeway2 at turn6 is unsafe because of the third car.\n\nThus, from (5,3) we cannot go to (6,2) because unsafe.\n\nSo from (5,3) we have no safe moves? \n\nBut wait, we can also consider moving to y=3? But we tried S: to (6,3) -> unsafe. U: (6,4) -> unsafe. D: (6,2) -> unsafe. So (5,3) leads to no next state.\n\nSimilarly, state (5,2) at turn5: \n   We are at freeway2 at turn5 -> we checked at generation: safe.\n   Actions:\n        U: (6,3) -> freeway3 at turn6 unsafe -> discard.\n        S: (6,2) -> freeway2 at turn6 unsafe -> discard.\n        D: (6,1) -> check freeway1 at turn6.\n\nFreeway1: \n   Car: (-48,-95,right,48)\n        low(6)= -95 + 48*(2) = -95+96=1, high(6)= -48+96=48 -> [1,48] -> doesn't cover 0? 0 is not in [1,48] -> safe.\n\n   So (6,1) is safe.\n\nTherefore, from (5,2) we can go to (6,1) by D.\n\nNow, we have at level 2 (turn=6): \n   (6,5) from (5,4) by U\n   (6,1) from (5,2) by D\n\nNow, we continue.\n\nWe also note that we might have other paths? But we are doing BFS by turn, so we are covering all states at turn=6.\n\nNow, at (6,5): \n   Actions: U -> (7,6)\n            S -> (7,5)\n            D -> (7,4) -> but freeway4 at turn7? We must compute.\n\nBut we have to check freeway5 at turn6: we are at (6,5) so we must check freeway5 at turn6? Actually, we did that when we generated (6,5): we checked freeway5 at turn6 and it was safe. So we can take actions.\n\nNow, we compute the next states for (6,5):\n\n   U: (7,6) -> check freeway6 at turn7.\n   S: (7,5) -> check freeway5 at turn7.\n   D: (7,4) -> check freeway4 at turn7.\n\nWe must compute:\n\nFreeway6 at turn7: \n   Car: (-48,-25,left,24) -> \n        low(7)= head0 - 24*(7-4)= -48 - 24*3 = -48-72 = -120\n        high(7)= tail0 - 24*3 = -25 -72 = -97 -> so [-120, -97] -> safe.\n\nFreeway5 at turn7:\n   Cars: \n        (-24,-35,right,6): \n            low(7)= -35 + 6*(3)= -35+18=-17\n            high(7)= -24+18=-6 -> safe.\n        (24,13,right,6): \n            low(7)=13+18=31, high(7)=24+18=42 -> safe.\n\nFreeway4 at turn7:\n   Cars: \n        (-24,-35,right,12): \n            low(7)= -35 + 12*3 = -35+36=1, high(7)= -24+36=12 -> [1,12] -> safe (0 not included).\n        (48,37,right,12): \n            low(7)=37+36=73, safe.\n\n   So freeway4 at turn7 is safe.\n\nTherefore, from (6,5) we can go to (7,6), (7,5), (7,4) all safe.\n\nNow, at (6,1): \n   Actions: U -> (7,2)\n            S -> (7,1)\n            D -> (7,0) -> but y=0 is not a freeway, so no collision check? Only freeways 1-8 require check. So y=0 is always safe? and y=9 is the goal, so when we reach y=9 we stop.\n\n   For (7,2): check freeway2 at turn7.\n   For (7,1): check freeway1 at turn7.\n   For (7,0): safe (no freeway).\n\nWe compute:\n\nFreeway2 at turn7:\n   Cars: \n        (-48,-59,right,4): \n            low(7)= -59+4*3=-59+12=-47, high(7)=-48+12=-36 -> safe.\n        (28,17,right,4): \n            low(7)=17+12=29, safe.\n        (-8,-19,right,4): \n            low(7)= -19+12=-7, high(7)=-8+12=4 -> [-7,4] -> covers 0? yes, because -7<=0<=4 -> unsafe.\n\n   So freeway2 at turn7 is unsafe.\n\nFreeway1 at turn7:\n   Car: (-48,-95,right,48)\n        low(7)= -95+48*3 = -95+144=49, high(7)= -48+144=96 -> [49,96] -> safe.\n\nSo from (6,1):\n   U: (7,2) -> unsafe (freeway2 at turn7)\n   S: (7,1) -> safe (freeway1 at turn7 safe)\n   D: (7,0) -> safe.\n\nTherefore, from (6,1) we can go to (7,1) and (7,0).\n\nNow, at level 2 (turn=6) we have two states: (6,5) and (6,1). Then at turn=7 we have:\n\nFrom (6,5): (7,6), (7,5), (7,4)\nFrom (6,1): (7,1), (7,0)\n\nWe continue.\n\nWe note that we are building the path. We want to reach (turn,9) as soon as possible.\n\nWe'll check at each state if we reached y=9.\n\nAt turn=7, we have states: (7,6), (7,5), (7,4), (7,1), (7,0). None is 9.\n\nNow, we expand each:\n\nFirst, (7,6): \n   We are at freeway6 at turn7 -> we already checked at generation? Actually, when we generated (7,6) we didn't check because we generated it from (6,5) by U and then we computed freeway6 at turn7 and it was safe.

We haven't reached y=9.\n\nWe expand each state at turn=8.\n\nFirst, (8,7): \n   Actions: \n        U: (9,8) -> check freeway8 at turn9.\n        S: (9,7) -> check freeway7 at turn9.\n        D: (9,6) -> check freeway6 at turn9.\n\nCompute:\n\nFreeway8 at turn9:\n   Car: (48,83,left,36) -> \n        low(9)= head0 - 36*(9-4)= 48 - 36*5 = 48-180 = -132\n        high(9)= tail0 - 36*5 = 83-180 = -97 -> safe.\n\nFreeway7 at turn9:\n   Car: (-48,-25,left,24) -> \n        low(9)= -48 -24*5 = -48-120=-168\n        high(9)= -25-120=-145 -> safe.\n\nFreeway6 at turn9:\n   Car: (-48,-25,left,24) -> \n        low(9)= -48-120=-168, high(9)=-25-120=-145 -> safe.\n\nSo all moves from (8,7) are safe: (9,8), (9,7), (9,6).\n\nNow, (8,6): \n   Actions: \n        U: (9,7) -> safe (freeway7 at turn9 safe)\n        S: (9,6) -> safe (freeway6 at turn9 safe)\n        D: (9,5) -> check freeway5 at turn9.\n\nFreeway5 at turn9:\n   Cars: \n        (-24,-35,right,6): \n            low(9)= -35+6*(5)= -35+30=-5, high(9)=-24+30=6 -> [-5,6] -> covers 0 -> unsafe.\n        (24,13,right,6): \n            low(9)=13+30=43, safe.\n\n   So unsafe.\n\nTherefore, from (8,6): we can go to (9,7) and (9,6), but not (9,5).\n\nNow, (8,4): \n   Actions: \n        U: (9,5) -> unsafe (freeway5 at turn9)\n        S: (9,4) -> check freeway4 at turn9.\n        D: (9,3) -> check freeway3 at turn9.\n\nFreeway4 at turn9:\n   Cars: \n        (-24,-35,right,12): \n            low(9)= -35+12*5= -35+60=25, safe.\n        (48,37,right,12): \n            low(9)=37+60=97, safe.\n   So safe.\n\nFreeway3 at turn9:\n   Cars: \n        (-24,-35,right,12): \n            low(9)= -35+60=25, safe.\n        (48,37,right,12): \n            low(9)=37+60=97, safe.\n   So safe.\n\nTherefore, from (8,4): we can go to (9,4) and (9,3).\n\nNow, (8,3): \n   Actions: \n        U: (9,4) -> safe (freeway4 at turn9 safe)\n        S: (9,3) -> safe (freeway3 at turn9 safe)\n        D: (9,2) -> check freeway2 at turn9.\n\nFreeway2 at turn9:\n   Cars: \n        (-48,-59,right,4): \n            low(9)= -59+4*5=-59+20=-39, safe.\n        (28,17,right,4): \n            low(9)=17+20=37, safe.\n        (-8,-19,right,4): \n            low(9)= -19+20=1, high(9)=-8+20=12 -> [1,12] -> safe (0 not included).\n   So safe.\n\nTherefore, from (8,3): we can go to (9,4), (9,3), (9,2).\n\nNow, (8,1): \n   Actions: \n        U: (9,2) -> safe (freeway2 at turn9 safe, as above)\n        S: (9,1) -> check freeway1 at turn9.\n        D: (9,0) -> safe.\n\nFreeway1 at turn9:\n   Car: (-48,-95,right,48): \n        low(9)= -95+48*5= -95+240=145, safe.\n\n   So safe.\n\nTherefore, (8,1): (9,2), (9,1), (9,0).\n\nNow, (8,0): \n   Actions: \n        U: (9,1) -> safe (freeway1 at turn9 safe)\n        S: (9,0) -> safe\n        D: (9,0) -> same as S.\n\n   So (9,1) and (9,0).\n\nNow, at turn=9, we have:\n\nFrom (8,7): (9,8), (9,7), (9,6)\nFrom (8,6): (9,7), (9,6)\nFrom (8,4): (9,4), (9,3)\nFrom (8,3): (9,4), (9,3), (9,2)\nFrom (8,1): (9,2), (9,1), (9,0)\nFrom (8,0): (9,1), (9,0)\n\nWe see that we have (9,8) from (8,7) by U. And y=8 is not the goal (goal is 9). But we are at turn9, and we can then move to 9 at turn10.\n\nBut note: we want to reach (0,9) at some turn. We are at (0,8) at turn9. Then we can do U at turn9 to get to (0,9) at turn10.\n\nBut wait: we are required to output the actions until the turn we reach y=9. So we need to get to y=9 at the last action.\n\nWe haven't reached y=9 at turn9. We need to continue.\n\nWe note that we are at turn9, and we have states with y from 0 to 8. We must continue until we get to y=9.\n\nWe expand each state at turn9.\n\nBut note: we are at turn9, and we want to get to y=9 as soon as possible. The minimal additional steps: if we are at y=8, then one U. If at y=7, then two U, etc.\n\nBut we must avoid collisions.\n\nFirst, we check the states at turn9: we must check if they are safe.\n\nFor example, (9,8): we are at freeway8 at turn9 -> we must check freeway8 at turn9: \n   Car: (48,83,left,36) -> \n        low(9)=48-36*5=48-180=-132, high(9)=83-180=-97 -> safe.\n\nSo (9,8) is safe.\n\nSimilarly, we must check all:\n\n(9,7): freeway7 at turn9: \n   Car: (-48,-25,left,24) -> \n        low(9)=-48-24*5=-168, high(9)=-25-120=-145 -> safe.\n\n(9,6): freeway6: same as above -> safe.\n\n(9,5): we don't have? Actually, we didn't generate (9,5) because from (8,6) we avoided D, and from (8,7) we did generate (9,6) and (9,7) and (9,8), but not (9,5). But wait, from (8,6) we generated (9,7) and (9,6) and from (8,7) we generated (9,8), (9,7), (9,6). So we have (9,5) missing? Actually, we don't have a state at (9,5) at this level.\n\nSimilarly, (9,4): freeway4 at turn9: safe (as computed earlier for freeway4 at turn9: safe).\n\n(9,3): freeway3 at turn9: safe.\n\n(9,2): freeway2 at turn9: safe (as above).\n\n(9,1): freeway1 at turn9: safe.\n\n(9,0): safe.\n\nNow, from each state at turn9, we can move:\n\nWe are looking for the quickest way to 9. The state that is at (9,8) can do U at turn9 to get to (10,9). Similarly, (9,7) can do U twice? but that would take two turns.\n\nBut we want minimal total H. We started at turn4, and we are at turn9 now, so 5 turns so far. Then if we go from (9,8) at turn9: one more turn (U) to turn10: then total turns from start: 10-4 = 6? But wait, we started at turn4 and we are at turn9 (so we have taken 5 actions: at turns 4,5,6,7,8). Then at turn9 we take an action (6th action) to get to turn10 at y=9.\n\nBut note: the sequence of actions: from turn4 to turn9: that's 6 actions? Actually, the number of actions is the number of turns we simulate. At turn4 we are at the start, then we take actions at turn4,5,6,7,8,9: that's 6 actions to get to turn10.\n\nBut we note: at turn T, we take an action a_T, and then we become at position at turn T+1.\n\nSo to get to turn10, we take 6 actions (from turn4 to turn9).\n\nBut we can check if we can get to 9 at an earlier turn? We haven't reached 9 at turn9, so the earliest is turn10.\n\nNow, we must check: if we are at (9,8) at turn9, and we do U, then at turn10 we are at y=9. We must check: at turn10, we are at y=9. Since y=9 is the goal and not a freeway, no collision check? So it's always safe.\n\nTherefore, we can reach at turn10.\n\nSimilarly, if we are at (9,9) we are done? But we are not at (9,9) at turn9.\n\nSo the minimal H is 6? But wait: we started at turn4 and we take actions at turns: 4,5,6,7,8,9 -> 6 actions, and then at turn10 we are at (0,9).\n\nBut we need to output the sequence of actions from turn4 to turn9.\n\nBut note: there are multiple paths. We want the minimal H, and then any sequence that achieves it.\n\nWe see that we have a state at (9,8) at turn9. How did we get there? It came from (8,7) by U.\n\nAnd (8,7) came from (7,6) by U.\n\nAnd (7,6) came from (6,5) by U.\n\nAnd (6,5) came from (5,4) by U.\n\nAnd (5,4) came from (4,3) by U.\n\nSo the path: \n   turn4: U -> to (5,4)\n   turn5: U -> to (6,5)\n   turn6: U -> to (7,6)\n   turn7: U -> to (8,7)\n   turn8: U -> to (9,8)\n   turn9: U -> to (10,9)\n\nBut we are at turn10 at position (0,9). So we stop at turn9 with the last action.\n\nBut note: the problem says: a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} such that at the end we are at (0,9). And H is the number of actions.\n\nSo in this case, H=6.\n\nBut we must check if this path is safe.\n\nWe have:\n\nTurn4: at (0,3) -> action U -> then at turn5 we are at (0,4)\n   Check turn4: freeway3: safe (we did)\n   Then at turn5: freeway4: safe (we did)\n\nTurn5: action U -> turn6 at (0,5)\n   Check turn5: freeway4: safe? Actually, at turn5 we are at freeway4: we computed freeway4 at turn5: \n        cars: [-23,-12] and [49,60] -> safe.\n\nTurn6: action U -> turn7 at (0,6)\n   Check turn6: freeway5: \n        freeway5 at turn6: we computed: [-23,-12] and [25,36] -> safe.\n\nTurn7: action U -> turn8 at (0,7)\n   Check turn7: freeway6: \n        freeway6 at turn7: [-120,-97] -> safe.\n\nTurn8: action U -> turn9 at (0,8)\n   Check turn8: freeway7: \n        freeway7 at turn8: [-144,-121] -> safe.\n\nTurn9: action U -> turn10 at (0,9) -> goal.\n\nBut we must check at each turn the freeway we are on:\n\nAt turn4: we are at y=3 -> freeway3: safe.\nAt turn5: we are at y=4 -> freeway4: safe.\nAt turn6: we are at y=5 -> freeway5: safe (as computed: [-23,-12] and [25,36] -> no 0)\nAt turn7: we are at y=6 -> freeway6: \n        car: [-48,-25,left,24] at turn7: \n            [ -48-24*3, -25-24*3] = [-48-72, -25-72] = [-120, -97] -> safe.\nAt turn8: we are at y=7 -> freeway7: \n        car: same as freeway6? freeway7 has the same car: (-48,-25,left,24) -> \n        at turn8: [-48-24*4, -25-24*4] = [-48-96, -25-96] = [-144, -121] -> safe.\nAt turn9: we are at y=8 -> freeway8: \n        car: (48,83,left,36) at turn9: \n            [48-36*5, 83-36*5] = [48-180, 83-180] = [-132, -97] -> safe.\n\nSo the entire path is safe.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 6, and the actions are: U, U, U, U, U, U.\n\nBut wait, we started at y=3, and we did 6 U: 3->4,4->5,5->6,6->7,7->8,8->9 -> that's 6 steps.\n\nBut note: there might be a shorter path? We started at 3, and goal is 9: difference 6, so minimal steps is 6. And we found a path in 6 actions.\n\nBut we must check if we can do it in fewer? 6 is the minimal possible because we need 6 steps up.\n\nSo we have a solution.\n\nHowever, we note that there are other paths that might be safe and also 6 steps? For example, going up then down then up? But that would be more than 6 steps. So the minimal is 6.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nTurn t_1 (4): U\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\n\nBut the output format: the turn labels.\n\nWe are at turn t1 = 4.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 4: a_{4} = U\nTurn 5: a_{5} = U\nTurn 6: a_{6} = U\nTurn 7: a_{7} = U\nTurn 8: a_{8} = U\nTurn 9: a_{9} = U\n\nWe output:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 4: a_{4}\nTurn 5: a_{5}\nTurn 6: a_{6}\nTurn 7: a_{7}\nTurn 8: a_{8}\nTurn 9: a_{9}\n}\n\nBut we need to fill the actions.\n\nAlternatively, we can write:\n\nTurn 4: U\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\n\nBut note the format: it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" and so on.\n\nSo:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 4: U\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\n}\n\nBut wait, in the problem, the sequence is for t from 0 to H-1. Here H=6, so t=0 to 5: \n  t=0: turn4\n  t=1: turn5\n  ...\n  t=5: turn9\n\nSo the last action is at turn9, and then at turn10 we are at (0,9).\n\nThis matches.\n\nBut we must be cautious: is there any car that we hit in this path? We checked each freeway at the turn we are on, and they are safe.\n\nTherefore, this is a solution.\n\nBut note: at turn6 we are at freeway5: we computed freeway5 at turn6: \n   car1: [-35, -24] -> becomes at turn6: -35+12*2=-11, -24+12*2=0 -> [ -11, 0 ] -> but wait, this is the freeway5 car? \n\nWait, no: freeway5 cars are:\n   (-24, -35, right, 6) -> tail0=-35, head0=-24 -> \n        at turn6: tail0 + 6*(6-4) = -35 + 12 = -23, head0+12 = -24+12=-12 -> [-23,-12] -> does not cover 0.\n\n   and (24,13,right,6): \n        tail0=13, head0=24 -> at turn6: 13+12=25, 24+12=36 -> [25,36]\n\nSo indeed safe.\n\nBut what about freeway4 at turn6? We don't care because we are on freeway5 at turn6.\n\nSo the path is safe.\n\nThus, the minimal sequence is 6 U's.\n\nBut let me confirm if there is a path with 6 actions that is not all U's?

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to get the player from (0,4) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t_1 = 5, and I have to output a sequence of actions starting from turn 5.\n\nThe player moves vertically: U for up (y increases by 1), D for down (y decreases by 1), S for stay (y stays the same). y must stay between 0 and 9 inclusive.\n\nCars move horizontally on their freeways. For each car, I'm given its position at turn t_1=5, with head and tail, direction, and speed. I need to compute where the car will be at future turns to avoid the player being on the same freeway when the car's span includes x=0.\n\nCollision happens at turn T only if the player is on freeway y_T at that turn, and for that freeway, there's a car whose span includes x=0 at exactly turn T. Importantly, when the player moves to a new y, they are not on that new y until the next turn. So if I move from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T I'm still on y, and at turn T+1 I'm on y+1.\n\nThe goal is to reach y=9 as quickly as possible.\n\nCurrent player position: y=4 at turn 5.\n\nI need to go to y=9, so I have to move up 5 times, but I might need to wait or adjust because of the cars.\n\nSince moving down or staying might be necessary to avoid collisions, but since I need to go up, moving down might not be efficient unless it's to avoid something. But in this case, since I start at 4 and need to go to 9, I should probably go up as much as possible, but I have to check the car positions.\n\nFirst, let's list all the cars and their positions at turn 5, and then I can compute for future turns when they are at x=0.\n\nFor each freeway, I have multiple cars. I need to know for each turn and each freeway if there is a car covering x=0 at that turn.\n\nCollision occurs only if at turn T, the player is on y_T, and for that y_T, at turn T, x=0 is covered by a car on that freeway.\n\nSo I need to find, for each freeway and each future turn, whether x=0 is occupied by a car.\n\nSince the cars move at constant speed, I can find the times when a car covers x=0.\n\nLet me denote the current turn as t=5.\n\nFor each car, given its head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s at t=5.\n\nThe span is [h, τ] for left-moving? No, let's see the update:\n\nFor left-moving: direction left, I assume d indicates direction.\n\nIn the car state, it says \"direction d\", and in the update:\n\nLeft-moving: span(t_1) = [h, τ] → span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nRight-moving: span(t_1) = [τ, h] → span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nIn the right-moving case, at t_1, span is [τ, h], which might be confusing because usually head is the front.\n\nBut to avoid confusion, I should think in terms of the position.\n\nFor a car, the span is the set of x-coordinates it occupies.\n\nAt time T, the span is:\n\nIf left-moving (d = left), then x(T) = x(t_1) - s (T - t_1) for each point, so the left end and right end both decrease.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving, both increase.\n\nIn the description:\n\nLeft-moving: span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nSince it's moving left, the head is at h, which is the right end? I think there might be inconsistency in head/tail definition.\n\nLet's look at the values.\n\nFor example, freeway 1: (0, -47, right, 48)\n\nDirection right, so at t_1=5, span is [τ, h] = [-47, 0]? It says (head h, tail τ), so for this car, h=0, τ=-47, d=right, s=48.\n\nSince d=right, the span at t_1 is [τ, h] = [-47, 0], meaning from x=-47 to x=0.\n\nThen at time T, span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)] = [-47 + 48(T-5), 0 + 48(T-5)]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nx=0 is covered when the span includes 0.\n\nFor a car, at time T, x=0 is covered if min_span(T) <= 0 <= max_span(T)\n\nFor left-moving car, span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nSince it's moving left, if we assume head is the front, for left-moving, front is smaller x? I need to define.\n\nTo simplify, let's not worry about head/tail, just use the span at T.\n\nFor a car with direction d, speed s, at t_1, let L be the left end, R be the right end at t_1.\n\nFrom the update:\n\nFor left-moving: d=left, at t_1, span is [h, τ], and since moving left, h should be the right end, τ left end? In the example, freeway 1 is right-moving, [τ,h] = [-47,0], so τ is left, h is right.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, it might be consistent.\n\nIn freeway 6: (-72, -49, left, 24), so h=-72, τ=-49, d=left.\n\nFor left-moving, span(t_1) = [h, τ] = [-72, -49], which from -72 to -49, so left end -72, right end -49.\n\nThen at T, span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)] = [-72 -24(T-5), -49 -24(T-5)]\n\nSince moving left, both decrease.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving, both increase.\n\nNow, x=0 is covered at T if for the span [A,B] at T, A <= 0 <= B.\n\nFor right-moving, [A,B] = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nFor left-moving, [A,B] = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nIn terms of inequality.\n\nI can compute for each car the times when it covers x=0.\n\nx=0 covered when min_span <= 0 <= max_span.\n\nFor a car, the position changes linearly with time.\n\nLet Δt = T - t_1 = T - 5\n\nFor each car, I can find if and when 0 is in the span.\n\nThe span at T has length |h - τ|, which is constant.\n\nFor x=0 to be covered, it depends on the direction.\n\nLet me list all cars per freeway.\n\nFreeway y=1: one car: (h=0, τ=-47, d=right, s=48)\n\nAt t=5, span [τ, h] = [-47, 0]\n\nAt T, span = [-47 + 48(Δt), 0 + 48(Δt)] = [-47 + 48Δt, 48Δt] where Δt = T-5\n\n0 covered when -47 + 48Δt <= 0 <= 48Δt\n\nSince 48Δt >=0 for Δt>=0, so 0 <= 48Δt always true for Δt>=0? 48Δt >=0, so 0 <= 48Δt is true for all Δt >=0, since Δt integer, T>=5.\n\nBut -47 +48Δt <=0 must hold.\n\n-47 +48Δt <=0 => 48Δt <=47 => Δt <= 47/48 <1, so Δt=0, T=5\n\nAt T=5, -47 +0 = -47 <=0, and 0<=0, so covered.\n\nFor T>5, -47 +48Δt > -47 +48*(1) =1 >0 for Δt=1, T=6, min span = -47+48=1, max=48, so [1,48], 0 not in [1,48], so only at T=5, x=0 covered on freeway 1.\n\nBut at T=5, player is at y=4, not on y=1, so no collision. For future, freeway 1 is safe after t=5.\n\nFreeway 2: three cars\n\nFirst car: (-44, -55, right, 4) so h? head h=-44? tail τ=-55? d=right\n\nAt t=5, span [τ, h] = [-55, -44]\n\nd=right, so [τ, h] = [-55, -44]\n\nAt T, span = [τ + sΔt, h + sΔt] = [-55 +4Δt, -44 +4Δt]\n\n0 covered when -55 +4Δt <= 0 <= -44 +4Δt\n\nSo -55 +4Δt <=0 and 0 <= -44 +4Δt\n\nFirst: -55 +4Δt <=0 => 4Δt <=55 => Δt <=55/4=13.75, so Δt<=13\n\nSecond: 0 <= -44 +4Δt => 4Δt >=44 => Δt >=11\n\nSo for Δt from 11 to 13 inclusive, T=16 to 18.\n\nΔt=11,12,13; T=16,17,18\n\nSecond car on freeway 2: (32, 21, right, 4) h=32, τ=21, d=right\n\nSpan at t=5: [τ, h] = [21,32]\n\nAt T: [21 +4Δt, 32 +4Δt]\n\n0 covered? 21 +4Δt <=0 <=32 +4Δt?\n\nBut 21 +4Δt >=21 >0 for all Δt>=0, so min >=21>0, so 0 never <= min, so never covered.\n\nSimilarly, 0 <=32+4Δt always true, but min >0, so no.\n\nThird car on freeway 2: (-4, -15, right, 4) h=-4, τ=-15, d=right\n\nSpan at t=5: [τ, h] = [-15, -4]\n\nAt T: [-15 +4Δt, -4 +4Δt]\n\n0 covered when -15 +4Δt <=0 <= -4 +4Δt\n\nFirst: -15+4Δt <=0 => 4Δt<=15 => Δt<=15/4=3.75, Δt<=3\n\nSecond: 0 <= -4 +4Δt => 4Δt >=4 => Δt >=1\n\nSo Δt=1,2,3; T=6,7,8\n\nNow freeway 2 has multiple cars, so x=0 covered if any car covers it.\n\nSo for freeway 2, x=0 covered at:\n\nFrom first car: T=16,17,18\n\nFrom second car: never\n\nFrom third car: T=6,7,8\n\nSo overall for freeway 2, covered at T=6,7,8,16,17,18\n\nT=6,7,8 from third car, and T=16,17,18 from first car.\n\nNow freeway 3: two cars\n\nFirst car: (-12, -23, right, 12) h=-12, τ=-23, d=right\n\nSpan at t=5: [τ, h] = [-23, -12]\n\nAt T: [-23 +12Δt, -12 +12Δt]\n\n0 covered: -23+12Δt <=0 <= -12+12Δt\n\n-23+12Δt <=0 => 12Δt <=23 => Δt <=23/12≈1.916, so Δt<=1\n\n0 <= -12+12Δt => 12Δt >=12 => Δt >=1\n\nSo only at Δt=1, T=6\n\nSecond car: (60, 49, right, 12) h=60, τ=49, d=right\n\nSpan at t=5: [τ, h] = [49,60]\n\nAt T: [49+12Δt, 60+12Δt] min>49>0, so never covers 0.\n\nSo freeway 3 covered only at T=6.\n\nFreeway 4: same as freeway 3? \"(-12, -23, right, 12), (60, 49, right, 12)\" identical to freeway 3.\n\nIn the table, freeway 4 has same cars as freeway 3: (-12, -23, right, 12) and (60, 49, right, 12)\n\nSo same as freeway 3, covered only at T=6.\n\nBut freeway 4 is different row, but same car positions? Probably a copy or something, but we treat separately.\n\nFreeway 4 has cars at same positions, so also covered only at T=6.\n\nFreeway 5: two cars\n\nFirst car: (-18, -29, right, 6) h=-18, τ=-29, d=right\n\nSpan at t=5: [τ, h] = [-29, -18]\n\nAt T: [-29 +6Δt, -18 +6Δt]\n\n0 covered: -29+6Δt <=0 <= -18+6Δt\n\n-29+6Δt <=0 => 6Δt <=29 => Δt <=29/6≈4.833, Δt<=4\n\n0 <= -18+6Δt => 6Δt >=18 => Δt >=3\n\nSo Δt=3,4; T=8,9\n\nSecond car: (30, 19, right, 6) h=30, τ=19, d=right\n\nSpan: [19,30] at t=5, min>19>0, never covers 0.\n\nSo freeway 5 covered at T=8,9\n\nFreeway 6: one car: (-72, -49, left, 24) h=-72, τ=-49, d=left\n\nFor left-moving, span at t_1: [h, τ] = [-72, -49]? In the update: for left-moving, span(t_1) = [h, τ], and at T, [h - sΔt, τ - sΔt]\n\nSo here h=-72, τ=-49, so left end h=-72, right end τ=-49? Since moving left, left end should be smaller.\n\nAt t_1, [h, τ] = [-72, -49], so from x=-72 to x=-49.\n\nAt T, span = [h - sΔt, τ - sΔt] = [-72 -24Δt, -49 -24Δt]\n\n0 covered when -72 -24Δt <= 0 <= -49 -24Δt\n\nNow, -72 -24Δt <=0 is always true since negative, but 0 <= -49 -24Δt?\n\n-49 -24Δt is always negative for Δt>=0, since -49 -24Δt <= -49 <0, so 0 <= negative number? False.\n\n0 <= -49 -24Δt? Left is 0, right is negative, so 0 <= negative is false.\n\nThus, never covered. For all T, min_span <= -49 -24Δt <= -49 <0, max_span = -72 -24Δt <0, so span entirely left of 0, never covers x=0.\n\nSo freeway 6 always safe.\n\nFreeway 7: same as freeway 6? \"(-72, -49, left, 24)\" identical, so also always safe.\n\nFreeway 8: (12, 47, left, 36) h=12, τ=47, d=left\n\nFor left-moving, span at t_1: [h, τ] = [12, 47]? But moving left, so if h=12, τ=47, that might be inconsistent.\n\nIn the description, for left-moving, [h, τ] at t_1, but in this case h=12, τ=47, both positive, and moving left.\n\nAt t_1, span [12,47], so from x=12 to x=47.\n\nThen at T, span [h - sΔt, τ - sΔt] = [12 -36Δt, 47 -36Δt]\n\n0 covered when 12 -36Δt <= 0 <= 47 -36Δt\n\nFirst inequality: 12 -36Δt <=0 => -36Δt <= -12 => 36Δt >=12 => Δt >= 12/36 = 1/3, so for Δt >=1 since integer.\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= 47 -36Δt => 47 -36Δt >=0 => 36Δt <=47 => Δt <=47/36≈1.305, so Δt<=1\n\nThus, Δt=1, T=6\n\nAt Δt=1, min=12-36= -24 <=0, max=47-36=11 >=0, so yes 0 in [-24,11]\n\nFor other times, not.\n\nSo freeway 8 covered at T=6 only.\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway, times when x=0 is occupied (collision if player on that freeway at that turn):\n\ny=1: only at T=5 (but player not on it)\n\ny=2: occupied at T=6,7,8,16,17,18\n\ny=3: occupied at T=6\n\ny=4: occupied at T=6 (same as y=3)\n\ny=5: occupied at T=8,9\n\ny=6: never occupied\n\ny=7: never occupied\n\ny=8: occupied at T=6\n\ny=9: no cars, always safe, I assume.\n\nPlayer needs to reach y=9.\n\nCurrent at t=5, y=4.\n\nI need to move from y=4 to y=9.\n\nEach action changes y by +1, -1, or 0.\n\nMinimal moves: if no cars, I could go up 5 times in 5 turns: from t=5 to t=9, y=4,5,6,7,8,9.\n\nBut I have to avoid being on a freeway when it's occupied at that turn.\n\nNow, let's see the occupied times.\n\nFirst, at t=5, player is on y=4. Is y=4 occupied at t=5? From above, y=4 occupied at T=6, not at T=5. At T=5, only y=1 occupied, but y=4 not. So at t=5, player on y=4 is safe.\n\nNow, I need to plan actions from t=5 onwards.\n\nLet me denote the turn and y position.\n\nStart: t=5, y=4\n\nI need to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nPossible actions: U, D, S.\n\nBut D or S might delay, so I should use U mostly.\n\nNow, the dangerous times: from above, the occupied events:\n\n- At t=6: y=2,3,4,8 are occupied. y=2,3,4,8 all have occupation at t=6.\n\ny=2,3,4,8 all covered at t=6.\n\ny=4 is occupied at t=6, and player is currently on y=4 at t=5.\n\nIf I stay at y=4 at t=5, I am on y=4 at t=5 (safe), then at turn t=6, if I am still on y=4, I collide because occupied.\n\nIf I move to y=5 at t=6? Let's think carefully.\n\nAt turn t, I choose action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nThe position is updated after the action.\n\nAt the beginning of turn t, player is at y_t.\n\nThen I choose a_t, which sets y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nThen at turn t, the player is on freeway y_t for collision check.\n\nCollision at turn T depends on y_T and the car at y_T at time T.\n\nFor turn t=5: y_5 = 4, and at t=5, y=4 is not occupied (only at t=6), so safe.\n\nNow I choose a_5 for turn t=5.\n\na_5 can be U, D, S.\n\nIf a_5 = U, then y_6 = y_5 +1 = 5\n\nIf a_5 = S, y_6 = y_5 = 4\n\nIf a_5 = D, y_6 = 3\n\nNow, at turn t=6, I need to be on a freeway that is not occupied at t=6.\n\nAt t=6, occupied freeways: y=2,3,4,8\n\nSo unsafe: y=2,3,4,8\n\nSafe: y=0,1,5,6,7,9? y=0 and y=9 are also freeways? y=0 is the bottom, but cars are on y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 should be safe, no cars.\n\nSimilarly, y=6 and y=7 are always safe.\n\nSo at t=6, safe y: 0,1,5,6,7,9\n\nNow, back to a_5.\n\nIf I choose a_5 = U, then y_6 = 5\n\ny=5 at t=6: is it safe? y=5 occupied at t=8,9, not at t=6, so yes safe.\n\nIf I choose a_5 = S, y_6 =4, but at t=6, y=4 is occupied, so collision.\n\nIf I choose a_5 = D, y_6=3, at t=6, y=3 occupied, collision.\n\nSo only possible safe action at t=5 is U, to go to y=5 at t=6.\n\ny_6=5, which is safe at t=6.\n\nNow, at t=6, player at y=5.\n\nNow choose a_6 for turn t=6.\n\na_6 can be U, D, S.\n\nIf a_6 = U, y_7 =6\n\nIf a_6 = S, y_7 =5\n\nIf a_6 = D, y_7 =4\n\nNow, at turn t=7, what is occupied?\n\nFrom above summary:\n\ny=2 occupied at t=7 (since t=6,7,8)\n\ny=3 not occupied except t=6\n\ny=4 not except t=6\n\ny=5 occupied at t=8,9\n\ny=6 never\n\ny=7 never\n\ny=8 only t=6\n\nSo at t=7, occupied: only y=2? From above: y=2 at t=6,7,8; others not at t=7.\n\ny=3 only t=6, y=4 only t=6, y=5 at t=8,9, etc.\n\nSo at t=7, only y=2 is occupied.\n\nThus safe y: all except y=2.\n\nNow, at t=6, player at y=5.\n\nIf a_6 = U, y_7=6\n\ny=6 at t=7: safe, since only y=2 occupied.\n\nIf a_6 = S, y_7=5, at t=7 y=5 not occupied (only at t=8,9), so safe.\n\nIf a_6 = D, y_7=4, at t=7 y=4 not occupied (only at t=6), so safe.\n\nBut I want to go up, so probably U is best.\n\ny_7=6 is fine.\n\nNow, from y=5, if I go up to y=6 at t=7.\n\nNow, at t=7, player at y=6 (if I chose U at t=6).\n\nNow choose a_7 for turn t=7.\n\na_7: U, D, S\n\ny_8 = ?\n\nAt turn t=8, occupied:\n\ny=2 at t=8 (occupied)\n\ny=5 at t=8 (occupied)\n\ny= others not at t=8 except these.\n\ny=2,5 occupied at t=8.\n\nAlso y=3,4 not, y=6,7 safe, y=8 not at t=8.\n\nSo at t=8, occupied: y=2 and y=5.\n\nSafe: y=0,1,3,4,6,7,8,9\n\nNow, if at t=7, y=6, and I choose a_7.\n\nIf a_7 = U, y_8=7\n\ny=7 at t=8: safe.\n\nIf a_7 = S, y_8=6, safe.\n\nIf a_7 = D, y_8=5, but at t=8, y=5 occupied, collision.\n\nSo D is bad.\n\nU or S are safe.\n\nBut I want to go up, so U to y_8=7.\n\nNow, at t=8, player at y=7.\n\nNow choose a_8 for turn t=8.\n\na_8: U, D, S\n\ny_9 = ?\n\nAt turn t=9, occupied:\n\ny=2 at t=9? y=2 occupied at t=6,7,8, but not t=9? Earlier: y=2 occupied at T=6,7,8,16,17,18. So at t=9, not occupied.\n\ny=5 occupied at t=8,9\n\ny= others not.\n\nSo at t=9, occupied: y=5 only? y=2 not at t=9, y=5 at t=9.\n\nAlso y=3,4 not, etc.\n\nSo occupied at t=9: y=5\n\nSafe: all except y=5.\n\nNow, at t=8, y=7.\n\nIf a_8 = U, y_9=8\n\ny=8 at t=9: is it occupied? y=8 occupied only at t=6, not at t=9, so safe.\n\nIf a_8 = S, y_9=7, safe.\n\nIf a_8 = D, y_9=6, safe.\n\nBut U is good.\n\ny_9=8.\n\nNow, at t=9, player at y=8.\n\nNow choose a_9 for turn t=9.\n\na_9: U, D, S\n\ny_10 = ?\n\nAt turn t=10, what occupied?\n\nFrom above, no occupations at t=10 except later like t=16, but for now, y=2 at t=16,17,18, but t=10 is early.\n\ny=5 occupied at t=8,9, not t=10.\n\nOthers not.\n\nSo at t=10, no occupations? All freeways safe except possibly, but y=1 to 8, but at t=10, all should be safe.\n\nSpecifically:\n\ny=2: occupied t=6,7,8,16,17,18 not t=10\n\ny=3: only t=6\n\ny=4: only t=6\n\ny=5: t=8,9 not t=10\n\ny=6: never\n\ny=7: never\n\ny=8: only t=6\n\nSo at t=10, no freeway occupied, all safe.\n\nSimilarly for later.\n\nNow, at t=9, y=8.\n\nIf a_9 = U, y_10=9, which is the goal.\n\nAnd at turn t=10, if y_10=9, but we reach at turn when y=9, but the turn is when we are at position.\n\nThe player reaches (0,9) at turn T when y_T =9.\n\nIn the sequence, we need y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nt_1=5, so at some turn T, y_T=9.\n\nIn this case, if I go up at t=9, y_10=9.\n\nBut let's see the sequence.\n\nFrom above:\n\nt=5: start y=4\n\na_5: U, y_6=5\n\nt=6: y=5\n\na_6: U, y_7=6\n\nt=7: y=6\n\na_7: U, y_8=7\n\nt=8: y=7\n\na_8: U, y_9=8\n\nt=9: y=8\n\na_9: U, y_10=9\n\nAt t=10, y=9, reached.\n\nNow, check for collisions.\n\nAt each turn, position and occupation.\n\nt=5: y=4, not occupied at t=5, safe.\n\nt=6: y=5, occupied? y=5 occupied at t=8,9, not t=6, so safe.\n\nt=7: y=6, not occupied at t=7 (only y=2 occupied), safe.\n\nt=8: y=7, at t=8 occupied y=2 and y=5, y=7 not occupied, safe.\n\nt=9: y=8, at t=9 occupied y=5, y=8 not, safe.\n\nt=10: y=9, no cars, safe.\n\nSo this seems to work in 5 turns? From t=5 to t=10, but turns: actions from t=5 to t=9, H=5 actions, reach at t=10.\n\nt_1=5, actions for t=5,6,7,8,9, that's 5 actions, y at t=6,7,8,9,10.\n\ny_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{5+5-1} = y_9? Let's see the index.\n\nThe sequence of actions: {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nt_1 + t, t from 0 to H-1.\n\nSo for t=0, action at t_1, which is t=5.\n\nt=1, action at t_1+1=6, etc.\n\nAfter H actions, the position is at turn t_1 + H.\n\nBecause after action at t, position at t+1.\n\nStart at turn t, position y_t.\n\nAfter action a_t, position at turn t+1 is y_{t+1}.\n\nTo have y_{t_1 + H} = 9? No.\n\nThe minimal H such that y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nFrom the problem:\n\n\"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9), meaning y_{t_1 + H -1} =9\"\n\nAfter actions from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, the position at turn t_1 + H -1 should be 9.\n\nIn terms of turns:\n\n- At turn t_1, position y_{t_1}\n\n- After action a_{t_1}, position at turn t_1 +1 is y_{t_1 +1}\n\n- ...\n\n- After action a_{t_1 + k}, position at turn t_1 + k +1\n\nSo after H actions (from t_1 to t_1 + H -1), position at turn (t_1 + H) is y_{t_1 + H}\n\nBut we want y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\ny_{t_1 + H -1} is the position at turn t_1 + H -1, before any action at that turn.\n\nI think I confused.\n\nLet me read the problem.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAnd \"such that y_{t_1 + H -1} =9\"\n\nAt turn t_1 + H -1, the player is at (0,9).\n\nThe actions are applied from turn t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nFor example, at turn t_1, player is at initial position. Then we apply a_{t_1}, which moves to position at turn t_1 +1.\n\nThen apply a_{t_1 +1}, move to position at turn t_1 +2, and so on, up to apply a_{t_1 + H -1}, then position at turn t_1 + H should be... but we want at turn t_1 + H -1 to be at (0,9).\n\nInconsistency.\n\nStandard: at time t, position y_t.\n\nAction a_t chosen at time t, determines y_{t+1}.\n\nSo after choosing a_t, we have y_{t+1}.\n\nThe sequence: actions at times t_1, t_1+1, ..., t_1 + H -1, resulting in positions y_{t_1 +1}, y_{t_1 +2}, ..., y_{t_1 + H}\n\nBut we want that at some turn T, y_T =9, with T = t_1 + H -1.\n\nSo for T = t_1 + H -1, y_T =9.\n\nThat means that after H-1 actions? Let's see.\n\nSuppose H=1: one action at t_1, then y_{t_1 +1} should be 9? But T = t_1 + H -1 = t_1 +1 -1 = t_1, so we want y_{t_1} =9, but initially it is not, so H at least 1 or more.\n\nIn this case, start at t_1=5, y_5=4, not 9.\n\nAfter first action at t_5, y_6 is set.\n\nWe want y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nFor example, if H=1, y_{t_1 +1 -1} = y_{t_1} =9, but it is 4, not.\n\nH=2: y_{t_1 +2-1} = y_{t_1 +1} =9\n\nSo after one action, at turn t_1+1, y=9.\n\nSimilarly, H=3: y_{t_1 +2} =9, after two actions.\n\nIn general, to have y_K =9 for K = t_1 + H -1.\n\nSo the number of actions is H, and we reach at turn K = t_1 + H -1.\n\nIn terms of turns, from start turn t_1 to reach turn K = t_1 + H -1.\n\nWith H actions at t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nBack to the plan.\n\nIn my earlier plan, I can reach y=9 at t=10.\n\nt_1=5, so K = t_1 + H -1 =10\n\nSo 5 + H -1 =10, thus H-1=5, H=6.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =10, t_1=5, so 5 + H -1 =10, H-1=5, H=6 actions.\n\nBut in the sequence, I have actions at t=5,6,7,8,9, that's 5 actions, to reach y_{10}=9, but we want y_K=9 with K= t_1 + H -1.\n\nIf H=5, K=5+5-1=9, y_9=9.\n\nBut in my sequence, at t=9, y=8, not 9.\n\nI need y_9=9.\n\nIn my actions: at t=5: U, y6=5\n\nt=6: U, y7=6\n\nt=7: U, y8=7\n\nt=8: U, y9=8\n\nThen at t=9, I need to set y10, but to have y9=9, I need at turn 9, y9=9.\n\ny9 is set by action at t=8.\n\nFrom y8, action at t=8 determines y9.\n\nIn the sequence above, at t=8, y8=7, I did U, so y9=8.\n\nBut I need y9=9.\n\nSo I need to reach y=9 earlier.\n\nMinimal H.\n\nSince I start at y=4, need to increase by 5, so minimal H=5 actions to go up 5 times, but with possible waits.\n\nIn this case, with the cars, I might need to wait somewhere.\n\nIn my sequence, at t=9, y=8, so I need one more action to go to y=9 at t=10.\n\nBut to have y9=9, I need to be at y=8 at t=8 or something.\n\nLet's list the turns I need to avoid.\n\nI need to be at y=9 at some turn K.\n\nK must be such that at that turn, y=9 is safe, which it is.\n\nBut during the path, I need to avoid being on occupied freeways at wrong times.\n\nNow, the constraints:\n\nAt t=6, y=2,3,4,8 are occupied, so I cannot be on these at t=6.\n\nSimilarly, at t=7, y=2 occupied\n\nAt t=8, y=2 and y=5 occupied\n\nAt t=9, y=5 occupied\n\nAlso later t=16,17,18 y=2 occupied, but that's far, I can reach before.\n\nI need to reach by t=9 or earlier if possible.\n\nCan I reach y=9 by t=9?\n\nThat means y9=9.\n\ny9=9 means that at turn 9, position is 9.\n\nNow, to get from y5=4 to y9=9 in 4 steps? From t=5 to t=9, that's 4 actions: at t=5,6,7,8.\n\nEach action can increase y by at most 1, so to go from 4 to 9, need +5, so minimum 5 actions, cannot in 4 actions.\n\nFrom y5=4 to y9=9, the change happens over turns.\n\ny at t=5:4\n\nAfter a5, y6\n\nAfter a6, y7\n\nAfter a7, y8\n\nAfter a8, y9\n\nSo from y5 to y9, it takes 4 actions: a5 to a8.\n\ny5 to y6 (one action), y6 to y7 (second), y7 to y8 (third), y8 to y9 (fourth). So 4 actions to go from state at t=5 to state at t=9.\n\nBut to increase y by 5, from 4 to 9, with each action max +1, so minimum 5 increases, so impossible in 4 actions; it must take at least 5 actions to gain 5 in y.\n\nFor example, if all U, y6=5, y7=6, y8=7, y9=8, still only 8, need one more to 9.\n\nTo have y9=9, I need y8=8 or y8=9 with S, but if y8=9, then earlier.\n\ny9=9 can be achieved if y8=9 and a8=S, or y8=8 and a8=U, or y8=10 but y<=9, so not.\n\nSo y8 must be 8 or 9.\n\nIf y8=9, then at t=8, position is 9.\n\nBut I start at y5=4, to y8=9 in 3 actions? a5,a6,a7 determine y6,y7,y8.\n\ny5=4 to y8=9, need +5 in 3 steps, impossible since max +3.\n\nSimilarly, y7=9: from y5=4 to y7=9 in 2 actions, max +2, impossible.\n\ny6=9: in one action from y5=4, impossible.\n\nSo the earliest possible to reach y=9 is at t=10, with y10=9, after 5 up actions starting from t=5.\n\ny5=4\n\na5=U: y6=5\n\na6=U: y7=6\n\na7=U: y8=7\n\na8=U: y9=8\n\na9=U: y10=9\n\nSo at t=10, y=9.\n\nWith H actions, we reach at turn t_1 + H.\n\nt_1 + H =10, t_1=5, so H=5.\n\nThen K = t_1 + H -1? Earlier I thought y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nIn this case, t_1 + H -1 =5 +5 -1=9, but y9=8, not 9.\n\ny_{t_1 + H -1} = y9=8.\n\nBut we want it to be 9.\n\nAfter H actions, position is at t_1 + H.\n\nBut the condition is y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nSo for y_{t_1 + H -1} to be 9, we need to have reached by that turn.\n\nFor example, to have y9=9, we need actions from t=5 to t=8 (4 actions), but as above, impossible to reach y=9 from y=4 in 4 actions.\n\nWith 4 actions, max y9=4+4=8 if all U.\n\nMinimal to reach y=9 is at least t=10 with 5 up actions.\n\nBut at t=10, y10=9, which is turn t_1 +5.\n\nNow, t_1 + H -1 =10 if H=6? t_1 + H -1 =5 + H -1.\n\nSet equal to 10: 4 + H =10, H=6.\n\nThen y_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{5+6-1} = y10=9.\n\nYes.\n\nWith H=5, y_{5+5-1}=y9, which is 8, not 9.\n\nSo we need H=6 to have y10=9 with y_{10} = y_{t_1 + H} if actions from t=5 to t=9? Actions at t=5 to t=9, that's 5 actions, H=5, positions from y6 to y10.\n\ny_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{5+5-1} = y9.\n\nBut y9 is after action a8? Let's clarify the turn numbering.\n\nDefine:\n\n- Turn t: player at position y_t\n\n- Choose action a_t\n\n- Then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t based on a_t\n\n- At turn t, collision check based on y_t and cars at t.\n\nFor reaching: we want y_T =9 for some T.\n\nThe sequence of actions from t_1 to t_1 + H -1 should result in y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nThat means at turn t_1 + H -1, y=9.\n\nIn the action sequence, we apply a_{t_1}, a_{t_1+1}, ..., a_{t_1 + H -2}, a_{t_1 + H -1}\n\nAfter applying a_{t_1}, we have y_{t_1 +1}\n\nAfter applying a_{t_1 + H -1}, we have y_{t_1 + H}\n\nBut we want y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, which is before applying a_{t_1 + H -1}, but y_{t_1 + H -1} is determined by previous actions.\n\nFor turn S = t_1 + H -1, we want y_S =9.\n\ny_S is determined by actions from t_1 to S-1.\n\nSpecifically, actions at t_1 to S-1 determine y_S.\n\nSince S = t_1 + H -1, so actions from t_1 to (t_1 + H -1) -1 = t_1 + H -2.\n\nNumber of actions: from t_1 to t_1 + H -2, that's (H-1) actions.\n\nBut we have H actions in the sequence? I'm confusing myself.\n\nFrom the problem: the sequence is {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1}, so actions at times t_1, t_1+1, ..., t_1 + H -1.\n\nAfter applying these H actions, the position at turn t_1 + H is y_{t_1 + H}\n\nBut we want that at turn t_1 + H -1, y=9.\n\nSo for turn t_1 + H -1, before any action, y_{t_1 + H -1} should be 9.\n\nBut y_{t_1 + H -1} is fixed at the start of that turn, determined by previous actions.\n\nIn the sequence, when we apply the actions, the first action a_{t_1} changes y from t_1 to t_1+1.\n\nSo at turn t_1, y is initial.\n\nAfter a_{t_1}, y_{t_1+1} set.\n\n...\n\nAfter a_{t_1 + H -1}, y_{t_1 + H} set.\n\nBut we want y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, which means that at the start of turn t_1 + H -1, it is already 9, so no action needed at that turn? But the sequence includes action at t_1 + H -1.\n\nIf y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, then at turn t_1 + H -1, we can choose an action, but since we are already at 9, we might do S or something, but the position is already 9 at that turn.\n\nIn this case, for the player to be at (0,9) at turn T, it means at that turn, position is 9.\n\nIn the action sequence, for turns before T, we move to reach y_T=9.\n\nFor example, to have y9=9, we need to arrive at turn 9 with y=9.\n\nSo actions at t=5 to t=8 determine y9.\n\nActions at t=5,6,7,8 set y6,y7,y8,y9.\n\nWith 4 actions, from y5=4, we can get y9=8 max, or if we do D or S, less, so y9<=8, cannot be 9.\n\nSimilarly, to have y10=9, we need actions at t=5 to t=9, 5 actions, setting y6 to y10.\n\ny10=9.\n\nThen for y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, with t_1=5, y_K=9 for K= t_1 + H -1.\n\nSet K=10, then 5 + H -1 =10, so H=6.\n\nThen y_{10} = y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nAnd the actions are from t=5 to t=10? t_1 to t_1 + H -1 =5 to 5+6-1=10.\n\nActions at t=5,6,7,8,9,10? But at t=10, if we are at y10=9, we might not need to act, but the sequence includes a_{10}.\n\nIn the sequence, for H=6, actions at t=5,6,7,8,9,10.\n\nBut after a_{10}, y11 is set, but we don't care.\n\nAnd at turn t=10, y10=9, which is what we want for K=10.\n\nIn terms of the turn when we are at 9, it is turn 10.\n\nWith 5 actions, we can be at y10=9, but for H=5, K=t_1 + H -1=5+5-1=9, y9 should be 9, but it is 8.\n\nSo for H=5, we cannot have y9=9.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 6, with y10=9.\n\nAnd actions include up to t=10.\n\nIn the output, we need to specify actions from t=5 onwards.\n\nBack to the path.\n\nIn my initial plan, with all U, I can reach y10=9, but I need to check if it's possible with the cars.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nt=5: y5=4, choose a5=U, then y6=5\n\nt=6: y6=5, choose a6=U, then y7=6\n\nt=7: y7=6, choose a7=U, then y8=7\n\nt=8: y8=7, choose a8=U, then y9=8\n\nt=9: y9=8, choose a9=U, then y10=9\n\nNow, collision checks:\n\nAt each turn T, check y_T and if occupied.\n\nt=5: y5=4, occupied at t=5? No, only t=6 for y=4, but t=5 not, so safe.\n\nt=6: y6=5, occupied at t=6? y=5 occupied at t=8,9, not t=6, so safe.\n\nt=7: y7=6, occupied at t=7? y=6 never occupied, safe.\n\nt=8: y8=7, occupied at t=8? y=7 never occupied, safe.\n\nt=9: y9=8, occupied at t=9? y=8 occupied only at t=6, not t=9, so safe.\n\nt=10: y10=9, no cars, safe.\n\nSo all good, and it takes 5 actions? But for H, we need 6 actions to have y_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{5+6-1}=y10=9.\n\nWith actions at t=5 to t=10.\n\nBut at t=10, we are already at y10=9, so action a10 can be S, for example.\n\nIn the sequence, we have to specify actions from t=5 to t=10, 6 actions.\n\nBut with the moves, from t=5 to t=9, 5 actions of U, we reach y10=9, then at t=10, we can do S or U, but y=9, U would go to 10, but y<=9, so probably not allowed, or stay.\n\ny must be in [0,9], so from y=9, U is invalid? Or does it stay?\n\nIn the update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with y in [0,9], so if y=9 and U, it might stay or error, but the problem says y_{t+1} \\in [0,9], so probably it clamps, but to be safe, from y=9, we should do S.\n\nSimilarly for y=0 and D.\n\nIn this case, at t=10, y10=9, we can do a10=S to stay.\n\nBut in the sequence, for the last action, since we are already at 9, S is fine.\n\nBut we need to include it for the sequence to have H actions.\n\nSince we reach at t=10, and we need to be at 9 at t=10, with actions from t=5 to t=10.\n\nBut for t=10, action is chosen, but position is already 9.\n\nNow, is there a way to reach earlier? As we saw, no, because y9 cannot be 9.\n\nPerhaps with different path, but I need to go up, so minimal turns to increase y.\n\nSince I have to avoid some positions, I might need to stay or go down, but that would take more turns, so the all-up path seems efficient and safe in this case.\n\nBut earlier at t=6, I could have chosen to stay or something, but no need.\n\nIn this path, it works.\n\nBut let me confirm if at any point I am on occupied freeway.\n\nt=6: y=5, not occupied.\n\nt=7: y=6, not occupied.\n\nt=8: y=7, not occupied.\n\nt=9: y=8, not occupied at t=9.\n\nAll good.\n\nBut in the beginning, at t=5, only U is possible, as S or D would go to y=4 or 3 at t=6, which are occupied.\n\nBut in this case, with U, it's fine.\n\nNow, for the sequence, with H=6.\n\nActions:\n\nAt t=5: U\n\nt=6: U\n\nt=7: U\n\nt=8: U\n\nt=9: U\n\nt=10: S (since y=9)\n\nBut at t=9, after a9=U, y10=9, then at t=10, we do a10=S, but y10 is already 9, and we stay, but the position at t=10 is 9.\n\nIn the sequence, we need actions for turns starting from t_1=5.\n\nThe minimal H should be the number of actions to reach, but here with 5 actions we can be at y10=9, but for the output, we need to include up to the action that sets the position or something.\n\nAccording to the problem, we need y_{t_1 + H -1} =9 with the actions.\n\nWith H=5, y_{5+5-1}=y9=8 ≠9\n\nWith H=6, y_{5+6-1}=y10=9, and actions from t=5 to t=10.\n\nAt t=10, action a10 is needed, but since we are at y10=9, we can do S.\n\nPerhaps we can reach at t=9 with y9=9, but impossible from start.\n\nAnother idea: can I be at y=9 earlier by going down or something? No, because y=4 to y=9, need +5, so earliest at t=10.\n\nUnless I start from higher, but I start at 4.\n\nSo minimal reach at t=10.\n\nThus H=6 with y10=9.\n\nIn the action sequence, I have 5 U and one S at the end.\n\nBut the S at t=10 is to stay, but it doesn't change position.\n\nSince the position is already 9 at t=10, and we need to specify action for that turn, we can do S.\n\nTo save an action, but we cannot, because H must be such that we reach at t_1 + H -1.\n\nPerhaps I can have y9=9 with H smaller, but impossible.\n\nSo I think H=6 is minimal.\n\nBut let me see if I can reach with H=5 by being at y=9 at t=9.\n\nBut from y5=4, after 4 actions, y9 <= 4+4=8, so y9=8 max, cannot be 9.\n\nSo impossible.\n\nThus, minimal H=6.\n\nNow, in the sequence, actions at t=5,6,7,8,9: all U, but that sets y10=9, so for turn t=10, we need to include an action, and since y10=9, we do S.\n\nIn the output, we specify actions from t=5 to t=10.\n\nBut for t=10, action a10.\n\nNow, for the freeway, at t=10, no issue.\n\nPerhaps I can do the last U at t=9 to set y10=9, and for t=10, since we are done, but we have to specify action.\n\nIn the sequence, it should be fine.\n\nBut in this case, with all U from t=5 to t=9, and S at t=10.\n\nBut t=9 action is U, setting y10=9.\n\nThen at t=10, we do S, which keeps y11=9, but we don't care.\n\nNow, but in the path, is there any constraint that forces me to wait?\n\nFor example, at t=8, if I were on y=5, it would be occupied, but in my path I am on y=7.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nBut earlier I thought y=4 is occupied at t=6, but I moved away.\n\nIn this sequence, I never stay on a dangerous spot.\n\nBut let me see if I can go faster, but no.\n\nPerhaps I can reach y=9 with fewer actions if I don't go directly, but since going down or staying adds turns, it would be slower.\n\nFor example, if at some point I stay, it delays.\n\nSo the all-up path is fastest.\n\nNow, but in the output, for turn t=10, I need to specify action.\n\nSince y=9, U is invalid or clamped, so S is safe.\n\nD would go down to 8, not good.\n\nSo S.\n\nNow, the sequence:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} for t_1=5\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: S\n\nH=6.\n\nBut in the action sequence, t from 0 to H-1=5, so actions at t_1 +0 to t_1 +5, i.e., t=5 to 10.\n\nNow, but let me confirm the collision at other points.\n\nAnother thing: when I move, at the turn I leave, I am still on that y.\n\nBut in this case, no issue.\n\nFor example, at t=6, I am on y=5, safe.\n\nIf I were to go to y=6 at t=6, but I move at turn t, so at turn t, I am on y_t, then I choose to move, so at turn t, position is y_t.\n\nIn this case, all fine.\n\nPerhaps I can start later, but no.\n\nAnother path: suppose at t=5, I do U to y=5 at t=6.\n\nThen at t=6, instead of U, I do S, y7=5.\n\nBut at t=7, y=5 is safe, since occupied at t=8,9.\n\nThen at t=7, I can go U to y=6 at t=8.\n\nAt t=8, y=6, safe.\n\nThen U to y=7 at t=9.\n\nThen U to y=8 at t=10.\n\nThen U to y=9 at t=11.\n\nBut this takes more turns, to t=11, worse.\n\nSo not better.\n\nSimilarly, any deviation adds turns.\n\nSo the direct path is best.\n\nTherefore, the sequence should be actions: U, U, U, U, U, S for turns 5 to 10.\n\nBut for turn 10, S.\n\nNow, in the answer format.\n\nBut let me write the turns.\n\nCurrent turn t_1=5.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: S\n\nH=6.\n\nBut is turn 10 included? t_1 + H -1 =5+6-1=10, and y10=9.\n\nYes.\n\nPerhaps I can have a sequence with H=5 but y9=9, impossible.\n\nSo I think this is minimal.\n\nBut in the car state, there is y=2 occupied at t=16,17,18, but I reach before, so no issue.\n\nNow, for the output.\n\nIn the sequence, for turn 10, action S.\n\nBut since the player is at (0,9) at turn 10, and we do S, it stays.\n\nBut the action is required.\n\nPerhaps the problem allows not specifying action after reaching, but according to the format, we need to specify the sequence until the turn we reach.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nSo minimal H=6.\n\nBut let me double-check if I can reach with H=5.\n\nSuppose I start at y5=4.\n\nWith one action: a5, y6 can be 3,4,5.\n\ny6=5 is best.\n\nThen a6, y7=4,5,6.\n\nIf y7=6, good.\n\na7, y8=5,6,7.\n\nIf y8=7, good.\n\na8, y9=6,7,8.\n\ny9=8 max.\n\nThen to have y9=9, impossible.\n\nIf I do more ups, but I can't.\n\nSo no.\n\nThus, H=6 is minimal.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is:\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: S\n\nNow, for the boxed answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 4)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 5\\) is 6. The sequence of actions is designed to avoid collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) based on their movement and occupancy at each turn.\n\n### Collision Avoidance and Path:\n- At turn 5, the player is at \\(y = 4\\). Freeway \\(y = 4\\) is occupied only at turn 6, so moving up to \\(y = 5\\) is safe.\n- At turn 6, \\(y = 5\\) is not occupied (occupation at turns 8 and 9 only), so moving up to \\(y = 6\\) is safe.\n- At turn 7, \\(y = 6\\) is never occupied, so moving up to \\(y = 7\\) is safe.\n- At turn 8, \\(y = 7\\) is never occupied, so moving up to \\(y = 8\\) is safe.\n- At turn 9, \\(y = 8\\) is occupied only at turn 6, so moving up to \\(y = 9\\) is safe.\n- At turn 10, the player reaches \\(y = 9\\). Since \\(y = 9\\) has no cars and is safe, the action is stay (S) to remain at the goal.\n\n### Action Sequence:\nThe actions are applied from turn \\(t_1 = 5\\) to turn \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 10\\), with \\(H = 6\\):\n- Turn 5: Move up (U) to \\(y = 5\\).\n- Turn 6: Move up (U) to \\(y = 6\\).\n- Turn 7: Move up (U) to \\(y = 7\\).\n- Turn 8: Move up (U) to \\(y = 8\\).\n- Turn 9: Move up (U) to \\(y = 9\\).\n- Turn 10: Stay (S) to remain at \\(y = 9\\).\n\nThis sequence reaches \\((0, 9)\\) at turn 10 with the minimal \\(H = 6\\), avoiding all car collisions.\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 5: \\ U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: \\ U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: \\ U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: \\ U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: \\ U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: \\ S }",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 6, and the player is at (0,5). The goal is to reach (0,9) in minimal turns H, avoiding collisions.\n\nWe note that the grid has y from 0 to 9. The freeways (where cars are) are from y=1 to y=8. The player starts at y=5 and must go to y=9, so we need to move upward.\n\nThe player can move up (U: +1), down (D: -1), or stay (S: 0). The player must not be on a freeway (y from 1 to 8) at a turn T if there is a car on that freeway at turn T that has 0 in its span at that turn.\n\nImportant: At turn T, if the player moves to a new freeway at T+1, then at turn T they are still on the old freeway (if any) and at T+1 they are on the new one. So the collision check at turn T is only for the freeway they are on at that turn.\n\nWe are given the state of the cars at turn t1=6. For each car, we are given (head, tail, direction, speed). Note the representation:\n\n- For right-moving cars: the tail is less than the head, and the car moves to the right (positive direction). So at time t, the span is [tail + s*(t-t1), head + s*(t-t1)]? Actually, the update rule is:\n\n  Right-moving: [τ, h] becomes [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)] at time T.\n\n- For left-moving: [h, τ] becomes [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)].\n\nBut note the representation in the table:\n\nExample: \n  Freeway 1: (48, 1, right, 48) -> at t1=6, the car is from 1 to 48? But wait, the description says for right-moving: span(t1)=[τ, h] = [1,48]. Then at time T, it becomes [1 + 48*(T-6), 48 + 48*(T-6)].\n\nBut note: the collision condition is that the player is on freeway y at time T, and the car on that freeway at time T has 0 in its span? Actually, the collision occurs if \"0 is in Span(T)\" for any car on the freeway y_T (the freeway the player is on at turn T).\n\nHowever, note that the player is at x=0 always? The problem states the player's position as (0, y). So we are only concerned with whether the car spans at time T cover x=0.\n\nSo for a car on the same freeway as the player at time T, if the car's span at time T includes 0, then the player collides.\n\nWe are to compute for each freeway and each future turn whether there is a car that covers x=0 at that turn.\n\nWe are at turn 6. We need to plan from turn 6 onward.\n\nWe are to output the sequence of actions starting at turn 6 (t=0 in the sequence) until we reach y=9.\n\nWe need to avoid being on a freeway (y=1 to 8) at a turn T if any car on that freeway at that turn has a span that includes 0.\n\nNote: at turn T, if the player is at y=0 or y=9, there are no cars (since cars are only on freeways 1 to 8). So we are safe at y=0 and y=9.\n\nThe goal is to get to (0,9). Once we are at (0,9), we are safe.\n\nWe start at (0,5) at turn 6.\n\nWe need to minimize H, the number of turns. So we want to get to y=9 as fast as possible.\n\nThe minimal number of moves without cars would be 4 (because 5->6->7->8->9: 4 moves). But we have to avoid the cars.\n\nWe have to check for each freeway (y=5,6,7,8) and for each turn when we are on that freeway, whether there is a car that covers x=0 at that turn.\n\nWe are going to simulate the car positions for future turns.\n\nLet me denote the current turn as t0 = 6.\n\nFor a car, at time T (>=6), the position is:\n\n  if right-moving: tail_T = τ + s*(T-6), head_T = h + s*(T-6)\n  if left-moving: head_T = h - s*(T-6), tail_T = τ - s*(T-6)\n\nBut note: the representation in the table for a right-moving car is given as (h, τ, d, s). However, in the table, for freeway 1: (48, 1, right, 48). So h=48, τ=1? Then the span at time 6 is [1,48]. Then at time T: [1+48*(T-6), 48+48*(T-6)].\n\nSimilarly, for a left-moving car, for example freeway 6: (48, 71, left, 24). Then at time 6: head=48, tail=71? But that would be [48,71] and then at T: [48-24*(T-6), 71-24*(T-6)].\n\nBut wait, the problem says for left-moving: the span at t1 is [h, τ] and then becomes [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]. So the head is the front? And for left-moving, the head is at the left? Actually, the representation might be consistent: the head is the leading part. For left-moving, the head is the leftmost? Actually, the update rule for left-moving: the head moves left (decreases) and the tail also moves left (decreases). So the head should be the larger coordinate? But the problem says for left-moving: [h, τ] -> [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]. So if h > τ, then the span is [h, τ] meaning from h down to τ? That doesn't make sense because then the head is at h and the tail at τ (with h>τ) and when moving left, both decrease. But then the span is from τ to h? Actually, the problem states the span as an interval. For left-moving, the head is the rightmost and the tail the leftmost? But then the span would be [tail, head]? But the problem says for left-moving: span(t1)=[h, τ] and then [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]. This suggests that the head h is the rightmost (so at time t1, the car is from h to τ, but if h>τ then the car is from τ to h? Or if h<τ, then the car is from h to τ? The representation in the table has for left-moving: (48,71,left,24) -> so h=48, τ=71. Then at time 6, the car is from 48 to 71? But then when moving left, the entire car moves left, so the leftmost becomes 48-24*(T-6) and the rightmost becomes 71-24*(T-6). But then the car would be from a lower coordinate to a higher? Actually, 48<71, so the car is from 48 to 71? Then when moving left, the car shifts left. So the span at time T is [48-24*(T-6), 71-24*(T-6)].\n\nBut note: the condition for collision is that 0 is in the interval [min, max]. For the left-moving car on freeway 6: [48-24*(T-6), 71-24*(T-6)] is the span. Since 48-24*(T-6) <= 71-24*(T-6), 0 is in the interval if:\n\n  48-24*(T-6) <= 0 <= 71-24*(T-6)\n\nSimilarly for right-moving: [1+48*(T-6), 48+48*(T-6)] and 0 is in the interval if:\n\n  1+48*(T-6) <= 0 <= 48+48*(T-6)\n\nBut note: at T=6, for freeway1: [1,48] -> 0 is not in [1,48] -> safe.\n\nWe are going to compute for each freeway and for each turn T (>=6) whether there is a car that covers 0 at that turn.\n\nWe note that each freeway has multiple cars. We only need to know if at least one car on that freeway at turn T has a span that includes 0.\n\nWe are going to precompute for each freeway k (1 to 8) and for each turn T (from 6 to, say, 6+20? because we expect H to be small) whether the freeway is safe (i.e., no car at that turn has 0 in its span).\n\nBut note: the player might be on the freeway at turn T, and we need to avoid when the freeway is unsafe.\n\nLet me list the cars per freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: \n  Car: (h=48, τ=1, d=right, s=48) -> at T: [1+48*(T-6), 48+48*(T-6)]\n  We need: 1+48*(T-6) <= 0 <= 48+48*(T-6)\n  Solve: \n    Lower bound <=0: 1+48*(T-6) <=0 -> 48*(T-6) <= -1 -> T-6 <= -1/48 -> T-6 is negative? -> only T=6? but T>=6 -> no solution? \n    Actually, at T=6: [1,48] -> 0 not in [1,48]. For T<6 it might be, but we start at T=6 and go forward. So for all T>=6, the lower bound is at least 1 (since T-6>=0) so the interval is [1+48*(T-6), ...] which is at least 1. So 0 is never in the interval. So freeway 1 is always safe? \n\nBut wait, what about T=6? [1,48] -> 0 not in [1,48]. Then T=7: [1+48, 48+48] = [49,96] -> 0 not in. So safe.\n\nFreeway 2: \n  Three cars:\n  Car1: (-40, -51, right, 4) -> wait, the table says: (-40, -51, right, 4). \n    For right-moving: [τ, h] = [-51, -40]? But the representation is (head, tail, ...). The problem says the state is given as (head, tail, direction, speed). \n    How do we interpret? The update rule for right-moving: [τ, h] becomes [τ+s*(T-t1), h+s*(T-t1)]. \n    But in the table, the car is given as (h, τ, ...) = (head, tail, ...). So for this car: head=-40, tail=-51, right. Then at time 6: the span is [τ, h] = [-51, -40]. Then at T: [-51+4*(T-6), -40+4*(T-6)].\n    We need 0 in this interval: \n        -51+4*(T-6) <= 0 <= -40+4*(T-6)\n    Solve for T>=6:\n        Lower bound: -51+4*(T-6) <= 0 -> 4*(T-6) <=51 -> T-6 <=51/4=12.75 -> T<=18.75 -> so T from 6 to 18.\n        Upper bound: 0 <= -40+4*(T-6) -> 40 <=4*(T-6) -> T-6>=10 -> T>=16.\n        So T in [16,18]? But T is integer? So T=16,17,18.\n\n        Check T=16: [-51+4*10, -40+4*10] = [-51+40, -40+40] = [-11,0] -> 0 is included? Actually, the interval is [-11,0] so 0 is included? But note: the interval is inclusive? The problem says \"0 is in Span(T)\", so yes. So at T=16,17,18: unsafe.\n\n        T=16: [-11,0] -> 0 in.\n        T=17: [-51+4*11, -40+4*11] = [-51+44, -40+44] = [-7,4] -> 0 in.\n        T=18: [-51+48, -40+48] = [-3,8] -> 0 in.\n\n        So unsafe at T=16,17,18.\n\n  Car2: (36,25,right,4) -> head=36, tail=25 -> so [25,36] at time 6. Then at T: [25+4*(T-6), 36+4*(T-6)]. \n        We need 25+4*(T-6)<=0<=36+4*(T-6). \n        Lower bound: 25+4*(T-6) <=0 -> 4*(T-6)<=-25 -> T-6<=-6.25 -> no solution for T>=6. So safe.\n\n  Car3: (0,-11,right,4) -> head=0, tail=-11 -> [ -11, 0] at time 6. Then at T: [-11+4*(T-6), 0+4*(T-6)] = [ -11+4*(T-6), 4*(T-6)].\n        We need: -11+4*(T-6) <=0<=4*(T-6)\n        The second condition: 0<=4*(T-6) -> T>=6. The first condition: -11+4*(T-6)<=0 -> 4*(T-6)<=11 -> T-6<=11/4=2.75 -> T<=8.75 -> T=6,7,8.\n        At T=6: [-11,0] -> 0 is included -> unsafe at T=6.\n        T=7: [-11+4,4] = [-7,4] -> unsafe (0 in)\n        T=8: [-11+8,8] = [-3,8] -> unsafe.\n\n        So unsafe for T=6,7,8.\n\n  Therefore, freeway 2 is unsafe at T=6,7,8 (from car3) and T=16,17,18 (from car1). For other T, safe? But note: at a given T, if any car has 0 in its span, then unsafe. So freeway 2 is unsafe at T=6,7,8,16,17,18.\n\nFreeway 3:\n  Car1: (0,-11,right,12) -> at time6: [-11,0] -> then at T: [-11+12*(T-6), 12*(T-6)]\n        We need: -11+12*(T-6)<=0<=12*(T-6)\n        The second condition: 0<=12*(T-6) -> T>=6.\n        First condition: -11+12*(T-6)<=0 -> 12*(T-6)<=11 -> T-6<=11/12≈0.916 -> T<=6.916 -> only T=6.\n        At T=6: [-11,0] -> unsafe (0 included).\n        T=7: [-11+12,12] = [1,12] -> safe.\n\n        So unsafe only at T=6.\n\n  Car2: (-48,-59,right,12) -> at time6: [-59,-48] -> at T: [-59+12*(T-6), -48+12*(T-6)]\n        We need: -59+12*(T-6)<=0<=-48+12*(T-6)\n        Lower bound: -59+12*(T-6)<=0 -> 12*(T-6)<=59 -> T-6<=59/12≈4.916 -> T<=10.916 -> T from 6 to 10.\n        Upper bound: 0<=-48+12*(T-6) -> 48<=12*(T-6) -> T-6>=4 -> T>=10.\n        So T=10: at T=10: [-59+12*4, -48+12*4] = [-59+48, -48+48] = [-11,0] -> unsafe? 0 is included? yes.\n        T=11: [-59+60, -48+60] = [1,12] -> safe.\n\n        So unsafe at T=10.\n\n  Therefore, freeway 3 is unsafe at T=6 and T=10.\n\nFreeway 4:\n  Same as freeway 3? \n  Car1: (0,-11,right,12) -> same as freeway3 car1 -> unsafe at T=6.\n  Car2: (-48,-59,right,12) -> same as freeway3 car2 -> unsafe at T=10.\n  So unsafe at T=6 and T=10.\n\nFreeway 5:\n  Car1: (-12,-23,right,6) -> at time6: [-23,-12] -> at T: [-23+6*(T-6), -12+6*(T-6)]\n        We need: -23+6*(T-6)<=0<=-12+6*(T-6)\n        Lower: -23+6*(T-6)<=0 -> 6*(T-6)<=23 -> T-6<=23/6≈3.833 -> T<=9.833 -> T=6,7,8,9\n        Upper: 0<=-12+6*(T-6) -> 12<=6*(T-6) -> T-6>=2 -> T>=8\n        So T in [8,9]: T=8,9.\n\n        T=8: [-23+12, -12+12] = [-11,0] -> unsafe.\n        T=9: [-23+18, -12+18] = [-5,6] -> unsafe (0 in).\n\n        So unsafe at T=8,9.\n\n  Car2: (36,25,right,6) -> head=36, tail=25 -> [25,36] at time6 -> at T: [25+6*(T-6), 36+6*(T-6)] -> for T>=6, the smallest is 25 at T=6, so 0 not in. Safe.\n\n  Therefore, freeway 5 unsafe at T=8,9.\n\nFreeway 6:\n  Car: (48,71,left,24) -> at time6: [48,71] -> at T: [48-24*(T-6), 71-24*(T-6)]\n        We need: 48-24*(T-6) <=0<=71-24*(T-6)\n        First inequality: 48-24*(T-6)<=0 -> 24*(T-6)>=48 -> T-6>=2 -> T>=8.\n        Second: 0<=71-24*(T-6) -> 24*(T-6)<=71 -> T-6<=71/24≈2.958 -> T<=8.958 -> T=8.\n        So only T=8: [48-24*2, 71-24*2] = [48-48,71-48] = [0,23] -> 0 is included -> unsafe.\n\n        T=9: [48-24*3, 71-24*3] = [48-72,71-72] = [-24,-1] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\n        So unsafe only at T=8.\n\nFreeway 7:\n  Same as freeway6: (48,71,left,24) -> same calculation: unsafe only at T=8.\n\nFreeway 8:\n  Car: (-24,11,left,36) -> head=-24, tail=11? But for left-moving: at time6: [h, τ] = [-24,11]? Then at T: [-24-36*(T-6), 11-36*(T-6)].\n        But note: the head is -24 and tail is 11? Then the car is from -24 to 11? Then moving left: so the entire car shifts left.\n\n        We need: -24-36*(T-6) <=0<=11-36*(T-6)\n\n        First inequality: -24-36*(T-6)<=0 -> -36*(T-6)<=24 -> multiply by -1 (reverse inequality): 36*(T-6)>=-24 -> T-6>=-24/36=-2/3 -> always true for T>=6.\n\n        Second: 0<=11-36*(T-6) -> 36*(T-6)<=11 -> T-6<=11/36≈0.305 -> T<=6.305 -> only T=6.\n\n        At T=6: [-24,11] -> 0 is in? yes, because -24<=0<=11. So unsafe at T=6.\n\n        T=7: [-24-36, 11-36] = [-60,-25] -> safe.\n\n        So unsafe only at T=6.\n\nSummary of unsafe freeways and turns:\n\nFreeway 1: always safe.\nFreeway 2: unsafe at T=6,7,8,16,17,18 -> but we are planning for the next few turns (we hope to finish in 4-10 turns) so we care about T=6 to about T=12.\nFreeway 3: unsafe at T=6,10.\nFreeway 4: unsafe at T=6,10.\nFreeway 5: unsafe at T=8,9.\nFreeway 6: unsafe at T=8.\nFreeway 7: unsafe at T=8.\nFreeway 8: unsafe at T=6.\n\nWe start at turn 6, at y=5.\n\nWe need to get to y=9. The minimal moves would be 4 moves: U,U,U,U.\n\nBut let's check if we can go:\n\nTurn 6: at y=5 -> we are on freeway 5 at turn 6? But freeway 5 is safe at T=6? (from above: freeway5 unsafe at T=8,9 -> safe at T=6). So we can be at freeway5 at T=6.\n\nBut note: we are at T=6, and we are already at y=5? So we must check: at T=6, we are on freeway5 -> is freeway5 safe at T=6? We computed freeway5 unsafe only at T=8,9 -> so safe at T=6.\n\nBut wait: the problem says that at turn T, we are on the freeway corresponding to y_T. So at the start of turn 6, we are at y=5 -> freeway5? Actually, the freeways are y=1 to 8, and y=5 corresponds to freeway5.\n\nSo at T=6, we are at freeway5 -> safe.\n\nNow, we need to choose an action at turn 6: U, D, or S.\n\nWe want to go up. Let's try to go up.\n\nIf we go up at turn6, then at turn7 we are at y=6.\n\nBut at turn7, we are at freeway6. And freeway6 is unsafe at T=8? but we are at T=7 -> safe? Because freeway6 unsafe only at T=8. So at T=7, freeway6 is safe.\n\nBut wait, we computed for freeway6: unsafe at T=8. So at T=7, safe.\n\nThen at turn7, we can go up again: to y=7 at turn8.\n\nBut at turn8, we are at freeway7. And freeway7 is unsafe at T=8? yes! So at T=8, freeway7 is unsafe. So we cannot be at freeway7 at T=8.\n\nTherefore, if we do U at turn6 and then U at turn7, we get to y=7 at turn8 -> collision.\n\nWe could do at turn7: S or D? But we want to go up.\n\nAlternatively, we might wait at some freeways.\n\nWe must avoid:\n\n- At T=6: \n    freeway2: unsafe (so we cannot be at freeway2 at T=6? but we are not there)\n    freeway3: unsafe -> so we cannot be at freeway3 at T=6? we are at freeway5 -> safe.\n    freeway4: unsafe -> but we are not there.\n    freeway8: unsafe -> we are not at freeway8.\n\n- At T=7: \n    We need to check freeway2: unsafe at T=7? yes -> so if we are at freeway2 at T=7, unsafe.\n    freeway3: safe? because unsafe at T=6 and T=10 -> so T=7 safe? yes.\n    freeway4: safe at T=7? yes.\n    freeway5: safe at T=7? (we computed unsafe at T=8,9 -> so safe at T=7).\n    freeway6: safe at T=7? (unsafe only at T=8 -> safe).\n    freeway7: safe at T=7? (unsafe at T=8 -> safe at T=7).\n    freeway8: safe at T=7? (unsafe only at T=6 -> safe).\n\n    So at T=7, only freeway2 is unsafe? and we are not going to freeway2.\n\n- At T=8:\n    freeway2: unsafe -> avoid freeway2.\n    freeway5: unsafe -> avoid freeway5.\n    freeway6: unsafe -> avoid freeway6.\n    freeway7: unsafe -> avoid freeway7.\n    freeway3,4: safe? because unsafe at T=6,10 -> so safe at T=8.\n    freeway1: always safe -> safe.\n    freeway8: safe? because unsafe only at T=6 -> safe.\n\n    So at T=8, we must not be on freeways 2,5,6,7.\n\n- At T=9:\n    freeway2: safe? (because unsafe at T=6,7,8,16,17,18 -> so at T=9 safe? yes) -> actually, we computed unsafe at T=6,7,8,16,17,18 -> so T=9 safe.\n    freeway5: unsafe at T=9 -> avoid.\n    freeway3,4: safe at T=9? (unsafe at T=6,10 -> safe at T=9).\n    freeway6: safe at T=9? (unsafe at T=8 -> safe at T=9).\n    freeway7: safe at T=9? (unsafe at T=8 -> safe at T=9).\n    freeway1,8: safe.\n\n    So at T=9, avoid freeway5.\n\n- At T=10:\n    freeway3: unsafe -> avoid.\n    freeway4: unsafe -> avoid.\n    freeway2: unsafe? at T=10? we computed unsafe at T=6,7,8,16,17,18 -> so T=10 safe.\n    others: safe.\n\n    So avoid freeway3 and 4 at T=10.\n\nWe want to get to y=9 as fast as possible.\n\nWe start at T=6, y=5.\n\nWe must avoid being at freeway5 at T=8 and T=9? because freeway5 is unsafe at T=8,9.\n\nBut at T=6, we are at freeway5. We can move or stay.\n\nOption 1: go up as fast as possible, but we saw that going up at T6 and T7 leads to y=7 at T8 -> freeway7 at T8: unsafe.\n\nSo we must not be at freeway7 at T8.\n\nWe could:\n\n- At T6: S -> stay at y=5 at T7 -> then at T7, we are at freeway5. But freeway5 is unsafe at T8? but at T7 we are safe? and then at T8 we are still at freeway5? which is unsafe at T8 -> so we must not be at freeway5 at T8.\n\nSo if we do S at T6, then at T7 we are at freeway5. Then at T7, we must leave freeway5? We can go up to freeway6 or down to freeway4.\n\nIf we go up at T7: then at T8 we are at freeway6 -> unsafe at T8? freeway6 unsafe at T8 -> so not allowed.\n\nIf we go down at T7: then at T8 we are at freeway4. Freeway4 at T8 is safe? (because unsafe at T6 and T10 -> safe at T8). So that is safe.\n\nThen at T8, we are at freeway4. Then we can go up at T8: to freeway5 at T9 -> but freeway5 is unsafe at T9 -> not allowed.\n\nOr stay at freeway4 at T9: safe? because freeway4 unsafe only at T6,10 -> safe at T9.\n\nBut then we are at freeway4 at T9, and we are at y=4? Then we have to go up: to freeway5 at T10? but freeway5 at T10: we computed unsafe at T8,9 -> safe at T10? yes. But freeway5 unsafe at T8,9 -> so at T10 safe? but we are going to freeway5 at T10: so we are at freeway5 at T10 -> safe? yes.\n\nBut note: we are at freeway4 at T9 -> safe. Then at T9 we can go up to freeway5 at T10 -> safe.\n\nThen at T10 we are at freeway5 -> safe? because unsafe at T8,9 -> safe at T10.\n\nThen at T10 we can go up to freeway6 at T11 -> freeway6 at T11: safe? (unsafe only at T8 -> safe). Then freeway7 at T12: safe? (unsafe only at T8 -> safe). Then freeway8 at T13: safe? (unsafe only at T6 -> safe). Then to y=9 at T14? \n\nBut that is 8 moves? too long.\n\nAlternatively, we might do:\n\nT6: U -> to y=6 at T7 (freeway6 at T7: safe). \nThen at T7, we cannot go up to freeway7 at T8 because freeway7 unsafe at T8.\nSo we must avoid being at freeway7 at T8.\n\nOption at T7: \n  S -> stay at freeway6 at T8 -> unsafe at T8? freeway6 unsafe at T8 -> not allowed.\n  D -> go down to freeway5 at T8 -> unsafe at T8? freeway5 unsafe at T8 -> not allowed.\n\nSo we cannot stay or go down at T7? Then we must go up? but that leads to freeway7 at T8 -> unsafe.\n\nSo we must not go up at T6? \n\nThen let's try going down at T6.\n\nT6: D -> to y=4 at T7 -> freeway4 at T7: safe? (because unsafe at T6,10 -> safe at T7). \nThen at T7, we can go up to freeway5 at T8 -> unsafe? freeway5 unsafe at T8 -> not allowed.\nOr stay at freeway4 at T8: safe? yes (because unsafe only at T6,10 -> safe at T8). \nThen at T8, we are at freeway4. Then we can go up at T8: to freeway5 at T9 -> unsafe? freeway5 unsafe at T9 -> not allowed.\nOr stay: then at T9, we are at freeway4 -> safe? yes. Then at T9, go up to freeway5 at T10 -> safe? yes (freeway5 safe at T10). \nThen we can go up: T10: U -> to freeway6 at T11 -> safe. Then T11: U -> freeway7 at T12 -> safe. Then T12: U -> freeway8 at T13 -> safe. Then T13: U -> y=9 at T14. That's 8 moves.\n\nBut we want minimal H.\n\nWe must avoid the unsafe times. Notice that we must pass freeway7 and freeway8. Freeway7 is unsafe only at T=8, freeway8 unsafe only at T=6. So we can be at freeway7 at any time except 8, and freeway8 at any time except 6.\n\nSimilarly, freeway5 is unsafe at T=8,9 -> so we must not be at freeway5 at T=8,9.\n\nWe start at T=6 at freeway5. We must leave freeway5 by T=8? because we cannot be there at T=8.\n\nWe can go up to freeway6 at T=7, but then we are at freeway6 at T=7 -> safe. Then at T=7, if we go up to freeway7 at T=8 -> unsafe. So we cannot do that.\n\nAlternatively, at T=7, we could go down? from freeway6 to freeway5? but freeway5 at T=8 is unsafe -> we would be at freeway5 at T=8 -> unsafe.\n\nSo we must avoid freeway5 at T=8 and T=9.\n\nWe can go down at T=6: to freeway4 at T=7 -> safe. Then we are at freeway4 at T=7. Then we can stay at freeway4 at T=8? safe. Then at T=8, we are at freeway4. Then at T=9, we can go up to freeway5? but freeway5 is unsafe at T=9 -> not allowed.\n\nSo we have to wait at freeway4 until T=10? \n\nAt T=9, we are at freeway4 -> safe. Then at T=9, we can go up to freeway5 at T=10 -> safe (freeway5 safe at T=10). Then we can go up.\n\nBut that is:\n\nT6: D -> y=4\nT7: S -> y=4\nT8: S -> y=4\nT9: U -> y=5 at T10\nT10: U -> y=6 at T11\nT11: U -> y=7 at T12\nT12: U -> y=8 at T13\nT13: U -> y=9 at T14 -> 8 moves.\n\nBut we can try to go faster by going to other freeways? \n\nWhat if we go down to freeway3? \n\nBut freeway3 is unsafe at T=6 and T=10. We start at T=6 at freeway5 -> we go down to freeway4 at T7 (safe), then down to freeway3 at T8? freeway3 at T8: safe? (because unsafe at T6 and T10 -> safe at T8). Then we can go up from there.\n\nBut freeway3 at T8: safe. Then at T8, we are at freeway3. Then at T8, we can go up to freeway4 at T9 -> freeway4 at T9: safe? (unsafe only at T6,10 -> safe). Then at T9, go up to freeway5 at T10 -> freeway5 at T10: safe? (unsafe at T8,9 -> safe at T10). Then continue up.\n\nBut that is:\n\nT6: D -> y=4 (freeway4) at T7\nT7: D -> y=3 (freeway3) at T8\nT8: U -> y=4 (freeway4) at T9\nT9: U -> y=5 (freeway5) at T10\nT10: U -> y=6 (freeway6) at T11\nT11: U -> y=7 (freeway7) at T12\nT12: U -> y=8 (freeway8) at T13\nT13: U -> y=9 at T14 -> 8 moves.\n\nSame as before.\n\nWe could go down to freeway2? But freeway2 is unsafe at T=6,7,8. We are at T=6: we are at freeway5, not freeway2. If we go down at T6: to freeway4. Then at T7, if we go down to freeway3? then freeway3 at T7: safe. Then at T8, we could go down to freeway2? but freeway2 is unsafe at T8 -> not allowed. So we avoid freeway2.\n\nWhat if we go up to freeway6 at T7, and then at T7 we wait? But we cannot stay at freeway6 at T8 -> unsafe.\n\nUnless we can skip freeway7 at T8 by being at freeway7 at a different time.\n\nBut we can only move one step at a time.\n\nAnother idea: go up to freeway6 at T7, then at T7 go up to freeway7 at T8 -> unsafe. But what if we could wait at freeway6 for one turn? but we can't at T8.\n\nOr: at T7, we go down to freeway5 at T8 -> unsafe.\n\nSo that doesn't work.\n\nMaybe we can go up to freeway6 at T7, then at T7 go down to freeway5 at T8 -> unsafe.\n\nSo we must leave freeway6 before T8? But at T7, we are at freeway6, and we have to move at T7 to avoid being at freeway6 at T8? But if we move at T7, we are at freeway5 or freeway7 at T8? both unsafe.\n\nSo we must not be at freeway6 at T7? \n\nBut we start at freeway5 at T6. If we don't go up at T6, then we go down or stay.\n\nBut if we stay at freeway5 at T7, then at T7 we are at freeway5. Then at T7, we must move to avoid freeway5 at T8. We can go up to freeway6 at T8 -> unsafe. Or down to freeway4 at T8 -> safe.\n\nThen we are at freeway4 at T8. Then we can go up at T8 to freeway5 at T9 -> unsafe. So we cannot.\n\nOr we can go down to freeway3 at T8: safe. Then at T8, we are at freeway3. Then at T8, we can go up to freeway4 at T9: safe. Then to freeway5 at T10: safe. Then up.\n\nThat's 5 moves to get to freeway5 at T10: \nT6: S -> y=5 at T7\nT7: D -> y=4 at T8\nT8: D -> y=3 at T9? wait, no:\n\nActually:\nT6: at T6 we start at y=5, then we do action at T6: S -> at T7: y=5.\nT7: action: D -> at T8: y=4 (freeway4)\nT8: action: D -> at T9: y=3 (freeway3)\nT9: action: U -> at T10: y=4 (freeway4)\nT10: action: U -> at T11: y=5 (freeway5) -> but we want to go up, and freeway5 at T11 is safe.\n\nBut then we are at y=5 at T11, then we need to go to y=9: 4 more moves -> total 8 moves.\n\nBut we can optimize: from freeway3 at T9, we can go up twice to freeway5 at T11? \n\nAt T9: at freeway3, then T9: U -> freeway4 at T10 (safe) -> then T10: U -> freeway5 at T11 (safe). So that's two moves to get from freeway3 to freeway5.\n\nBut then at T11, we are at freeway5 -> safe. Then T11: U -> freeway6 at T12, then T12: U -> freeway7 at T13, then T13: U -> freeway8 at T14, then T14: U -> y=9 at T15? no, at T14 we would be at freeway8? then T14: U to y=9.\n\nBut that's 9 moves? \n\nLet me count the turns:\n\nWe start at turn6.\n\nAfter 0 moves: turn6: y=5.\nAfter 1 move: turn7: y=?\n...\n\nWe are to output actions for turn6, turn7, ... until the last action that lands us at y=9.\n\nThe turn when we are at y=9 is the turn after the last action.\n\nLet H be the number of actions. Then at turn6+H, we are at y=9.\n\nWe start at turn6: y=5.\n\nWe want to minimize H.\n\nWe must avoid being at a freeway that is unsafe at that turn.\n\nLet me try a different approach: try to go up as fast as possible, but avoid the unsafe turns by waiting at safe freeways.\n\nWe must pass freeway5,6,7,8.\n\nWe are at freeway5 at T6.\n\nWe cannot be at freeway5 at T8 and T9.\n\nWe cannot be at freeway6 at T8.\n\nWe cannot be at freeway7 at T8.\n\nWe cannot be at freeway8 at T6.\n\nSo we must leave freeway5 by T7? Because if we are at freeway5 at T7, then we can move at T7 to freeway4 or freeway6 at T8. But freeway6 at T8 is unsafe, and freeway4 at T8 is safe. But then at T8 we are at freeway4. Then at T8, we can go up to freeway5 at T9 -> unsafe. Or down to freeway3 at T8 -> safe. But then we are behind.\n\nAlternatively, we can leave freeway5 at T6: either up or down.\n\nIf we go up at T6: to freeway6 at T7. Then at T7, we are at freeway6. We cannot be at freeway6 at T8, so at T7 we must move to freeway5 or freeway7 at T8. But freeway5 at T8 is unsafe, freeway7 at T8 is unsafe -> no move.\n\nSo we must not go up at T6.\n\nIf we go down at T6: to freeway4 at T7. Then at T7, we are at freeway4. Then at T7, we can move to freeway3, freeway4 (stay), or freeway5.\n\nIf we go to freeway5 at T8: unsafe.\n\nIf we go to freeway3 at T8: safe.\n\nIf we stay at freeway4 at T8: safe.\n\nThen at T8, if we are at freeway4, we can move at T8 to freeway3, freeway4, or freeway5.\n\nIf we go to freeway5 at T9: unsafe.\n\nSo we must go down or stay.\n\nIf we go down to freeway3 at T9: safe.\n\nThen at T9, we are at freeway3. Then we can go up to freeway4 at T10: safe. Then to freeway5 at T11: safe. Then we can go up.\n\nSo the earliest we can be at freeway5 is T11.\n\nThen from freeway5 at T11, we can go to freeway6 at T12, freeway7 at T13, freeway8 at T14, and then to y=9 at T15.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nT6: D -> to y=4 at T7\nT7: D -> to y=3 at T8  [or could we go down only once?]\nT8: we are at freeway3. Then we can go up at T8: to freeway4 at T9.\nT9: U -> to freeway4 at T9? no, at T9 we are at freeway4. Then T9: U -> to freeway5 at T10? but freeway5 unsafe at T10? no, freeway5 unsafe at T8,9 -> safe at T10. So yes.\nBut wait: at T8 we are at freeway3. Then T8: U -> to freeway4 at T9.\nThen T9: U -> to freeway5 at T10.\n\nThen T10: U -> to freeway6 at T11.\nT11: U -> to freeway7 at T12.\nT12: U -> to freeway8 at T13.\nT13: U -> to y=9 at T14.\n\nSo the actions:\n\nTurn6: D\nTurn7: D\nTurn8: U\nTurn9: U\nTurn10: U\nTurn11: U\nTurn12: U\nTurn13: U\n\nThat's 8 actions.\n\nBut we can try to be at freeway5 earlier by not going down so far.\n\nAfter T6: D to y=4 at T7.\n\nThen at T7, instead of going down, we could stay at freeway4 for a few turns.\n\nAt T7: S -> y=4 at T8 (freeway4 at T8: safe)\nAt T8: S -> y=4 at T9 (freeway4 at T9: safe)\nAt T9: U -> y=5 at T10 (freeway5 at T10: safe)\nThen T10: U to y=6 at T11\nT11: U to y=7 at T12\nT12: U to y=8 at T13\nT13: U to y=9 at T14\n\nSo actions: 8 actions: D, S, S, U, U, U, U, U.\n\nSame number.\n\nBut can we do better?\n\nWhat if we go down to freeway4 at T7, then at T7 we go down to freeway3 at T8 (safe), then at T8 we go up to freeway4 at T9 (safe), then at T9 we go up to freeway5 at T10 (safe), then up as before. That's also 8.\n\nBut notice that we are spending turns to avoid the unsafe times. The unsafe times for freeway5 are T8 and T9, so we must be at freeway5 at a turn not in {8,9}. Similarly for others.\n\nThe earliest we can be at freeway5 is T6 (already there), T7, then T10, T11, etc.\n\nWe are there at T6, but then we have to leave and come back at T10.\n\nThe minimal time to leave and come back: \n  T6: leave (go down to freeway4) at T7.\n  Then we can come back to freeway5 at T10: that's 4 turns later (from T7 to T10: 3 actions: but we are at freeway4 at T7, then we need to wait until T10 to be at freeway5? But at T9 we can be at freeway4, then at T9 we go up to freeway5 at T10.\n\n  So from T6 to T10: 4 turns? But at T10 we are at freeway5.\n\n  Then from freeway5, it takes 4 moves to get to y=9: so total turns from start: \n      T6: start at y=5.\n      T6: action D -> T7: y=4\n      T7: action S -> T8: y=4\n      T8: action S -> T9: y=4\n      T9: action U -> T10: y=5\n      T10: action U -> T11: y=6\n      T11: action U -> T12: y=7\n      T12: action U -> T13: y=8\n      T13: action U -> T14: y=9\n\n  So actions: 8 actions (from T6 to T13).\n\n  But the last action at T13 lands us at y=9 at T14.\n\n  We count H=8.\n\nCan we do it in 7 actions? \n\nWe need to be at y=9 at turn 6+7 = 13.\n\nWe start at y=5 at T6.\n\nWe need to increase by 4.\n\nBut we have to avoid the unsafe turns.\n\nSuppose we do:\n\nT6: U to y=6 at T7.\nThen we are at freeway6 at T7 (safe).\nNow, we cannot be at freeway6 at T8, so at T7, we must move away. The only safe freeway to move to at T8 is freeway4 or freeway3 or freeway1? but we are at freeway6, so we can only go to freeway5 or freeway7 at T8. Both are unsafe at T8.\n\nSo no.\n\nT6: D to y=4 at T7 (safe).\nThen at T7, we go U back to y=5 at T8? but freeway5 at T8: unsafe -> not allowed.\n\nOr at T7, we go S to y=4 at T8 (safe).\nThen at T8, we go U to y=5 at T9: unsafe.\n\nOr at T7, we go D to y=3 at T8 (safe).\nThen at T8, we go U to y=4 at T9 (safe).\nThen at T9, we go U to y=5 at T10 (safe).\nThen at T10, we go U to y=6 at T11.\nT11: U to y=7 at T12.\nT12: U to y=8 at T13.\nT13: U to y=9 at T14 -> still 8 actions.\n\nBut can we from freeway3 at T8 go directly to freeway5 in two moves? \n\nAt T8: at freeway3.\nT8: U to freeway4 at T9.\nT9: U to freeway5 at T10 -> that's two moves, so we are at freeway5 at T10.\n\nThen as above.\n\nWhat if at T8 we are at freeway3, and we want to go up two in one move? not possible.\n\nAnother idea: use the safe freeways to wait only one turn and then move faster.\n\nFor example, after we are at freeway4 at T7 (from T6: D), then at T7, we go down to freeway3 at T8 (safe).\nThen at T8, we are at freeway3. Then at T8, we can go up to freeway4 at T9.\nThen at T9, we can go up to freeway5 at T10.\nThen at T10, we are at freeway5 -> safe.\nThen we go up: T10: U to y=6 at T11.\nT11: U to y=7 at T12.\nT12: U to y=8 at T13.\nT13: U to y=9 at T14.\n\nStill 8.\n\nBut notice that from freeway3 at T8, if we could go up twice at T8 and T9, we can only reach freeway5 at T10.\n\nUnless we can move faster? we can only move one step per turn.\n\nWe must not be at freeway5 at T8 and T9, and freeway6,7 at T8.\n\n freeway8 is safe after T6.\n\nWhat if we go up to freeway6 at T7, then at T7, we go down to freeway5 at T8 -> unsafe.\n\nOr, at T6, we stay at freeway5 at T7 (safe, because freeway5 safe at T7).\nThen at T7, we go down to freeway4 at T8 (safe).\nThen at T8, we are at freeway4. Then at T8, we go down to freeway3 at T9 (safe).\nThen at T9, we are at freeway3. Then at T9, we go up to freeway4 at T10.\nT10: U to freeway5 at T11.\nT11: U to freeway6 at T12.\n etc -> even more.\n\nSo not better.\n\nLet's try to be at freeway7 at T7? \n\nTo be at freeway7 at T7, we would have to be at freeway6 at T6 and go up at T6. But we are at freeway5 at T6. So we would need to be at freeway6 at T6, which we are not.\n\nAnother idea: go up to freeway6 at T6: but then at T6, if we go up, we are at freeway6 at T7, not at T6. We are at a freeway at the turn when we are there. So at the start of turn6, we are at freeway5. Then at turn6, we choose an action that determines y at turn7.\n\nSo we cannot be at freeway6 until turn7.\n\nSimilarly, freeway7 at turn8.\n\nWe have to pass freeway7 at some turn not 8.\n\nSimilarly, freeway5 at some turn not 8 or 9.\n\nThe only safe turns for freeway5 are T6, T7, T10, T11, ... \n\nWe are at freeway5 at T6. We can stay at T7 (safe), but then we have to leave for T8 and T9.\n\nThen we can return at T10.\n\nThe earliest we can return to freeway5 is T10.\n\nThen from freeway5 at T10, it takes 4 moves to get to y=9: \n  T10: U -> y=6 at T11\n  T11: U -> y=7 at T12\n  T12: U -> y=8 at T13\n  T13: U -> y=9 at T14\n\n  and then we are done.\n\nBut how to get from freeway5 at T7 to freeway5 at T10 without being there at T8 and T9.\n\nWe have to be at a lower freeway for turns T8 and T9.\n\nFor example, at T7: we are at freeway5. Then at T7, we go down to freeway4 at T8.\nThen at T8, we are at freeway4. Then at T8, we can go down to freeway3 at T9.\nThen at T9, we are at freeway3. Then at T9, we go up to freeway4 at T10.\nBut then at T10, we are at freeway4, not freeway5.\n\nTo get to freeway5 at T10, we would have to be at freeway4 at T9 and then go up at T9 to freeway5 at T10.\n\nSo:\n\nT6: we are at freeway5.\nT6: S or U or D? \n  If we do nothing, we are at freeway5 at T7.\n  Then T7: D -> to freeway4 at T8.\n  Then T8: D -> to freeway3 at T9.\n  Then T9: U -> to freeway4 at T10.  -> not freeway5.\n\nWe need to be at freeway4 at T9 and then go up at T9 to freeway5 at T10.\n\nSo at T9, we must be at freeway4.\n\nHow to be at freeway4 at T9.\n\nFrom freeway5 at T7, we go down to freeway4 at T8.\nThen at T8, we can stay at freeway4 at T9? yes, by doing S at T8.\nThen at T9, we are at freeway4, then U to freeway5 at T10.\n\nSo the actions:\n\nT6: S  -> at T7: y=5 (freeway5) [safe because T7 is safe for freeway5]\nT7: D  -> at T8: y=4 (freeway4) [safe]\nT8: S  -> at T9: y=4 (freeway4) [safe]\nT9: U  -> at T10: y=5 (freeway5) [safe]\nT10: U -> at T11: y=6 (freeway6) [safe]\nT11: U -> at T12: y=7 (freeway7) [safe]\nT12: U -> at T13: y=8 (freeway8) [safe]\nT13: U -> at T14: y=9\n\nThat's 8 actions: from T6 to T13.\n\nCan we save a move? \n\nNotice that after we are at freeway5 at T10, we need 4 moves to get to y=9. Is there a way to be at freeway5 before T10? \n\nThe only safe turns for freeway5 before T10 are T6 and T7. We are at T6 and T7, but then we have to leave and come back at T10.\n\nThe minimal number of moves from freeway5 at T7 to freeway5 at T10 is 3 moves: \n  T7: from freeway5, we move down to freeway4 at T8 (1 move)\n  Then we have to wait at freeway4 for one turn: T8 to T9 (stay: 1 move) \n  Then T9: up to freeway5 at T10 (1 move) -> 3 moves.\n\nThen from freeway5 at T10, 4 moves to y=9 -> total 7 moves? But wait, the moves are:\n\n  T6: we start at freeway5.\n  We already used T6 to do an action? \n\n  At T6: we are at freeway5. We can do an action that determines y at T7.\n\n  To be at freeway5 at T7, we do S at T6: then at T7, freeway5.\n\n  Then we do:\n      T7: D -> to freeway4 at T8\n      T8: S -> to freeway4 at T9\n      T9: U -> to freeway5 at T10\n      T10: U -> to freeway6 at T11\n      T11: U -> to freeway7 at T12\n      T12: U -> to freeway8 at T13\n      T13: U -> to y=9 at T14\n\n  That's 7 actions: T6 to T12? Let's list the actions and the state after the action.\n\n  Turn6: action S -> at the end of turn6, we are still at y=5? No, the player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t.\n  At the beginning of turn6, y=5.\n  After action S, at turn7, y=5.\n\n  Then turn7: action D -> at turn8, y=4.\n  turn8: action S -> at turn9, y=4.\n  turn9: action U -> at turn10, y=5.\n  turn10: action U -> at turn11, y=6.\n  turn11: action U -> at turn12, y=7.\n  turn12: action U -> at turn13, y=8.\n  turn13: action U -> at turn14, y=9.\n\n  So we need an action at turn13 to get to y=9 at turn14.\n\n  That's 8 actions: turn6 to turn13.\n\n  The sequence has 8 actions.\n\n  The last action is at turn13, and then at turn14 we are at y=9.\n\n  So H=8.\n\n  But we can try to combine the last moves.\n\n  Is there a way to be at freeway5 at T10 with fewer than 3 actions from T7? No, because we have to go down, then wait, then up.\n\n  unless we can go down two levels and then up, but that would be more actions.\n\n  or if we can be at freeway5 at T10 without waiting, but we have to avoid T8 and T9.\n\n  so the waiting is necessary.\n\n  Another idea: after freeway5 at T7, we go down to freeway4 at T8, then at T8, we go down to freeway3 at T9, then at T9, we go up to freeway4 at T10, then at T10, we go up to freeway5 at T11. That's more actions.\n\n  So the fastest is 8 actions.\n\n  But let me double-check if we can do it in 7 actions.\n\n  Suppose we do:\n\n  T6: U to y=6 at T7  [ freeway6 at T7: safe]\n  T7: we have to leave freeway6 because at T8 it is unsafe. We can only go to freeway5 or freeway7 at T8, both unsafe.\n  -> not possible.\n\n  T6: D to y=4 at T7  [freeway4 at T7: safe]\n  T7: U to y=5 at T8  [freeway5 at T8: unsafe] -> not allowed.\n\n  T6: D to y=4 at T7\n  T7: D to y=3 at T8  [freeway3 at T8: safe]\n  T8: U to y=4 at T9  [freeway4 at T9: safe]\n  T9: U to y=5 at T10  [freeway5 at T10: safe]\n  T10: U to y=6 at T11\n  T11: U to y=7 at T12\n  T12: U to y=8 at T13\n  T13: U to y=9 at T14\n\n  actions: 8 actions.\n\n  But wait, can we from freeway3 at T8 go directly to freeway5 in two actions? \n      T8: at freeway3.\n      T8: U to freeway4 at T9.\n      T9: U to freeway5 at T10.\n      -> two actions.\n\n  So we are at freeway5 at T10.\n\n  Then we need 4 actions to get to y=9: \n      T10: U to y=6\n      T11: U to y=7\n      T12: U to y=8\n      T13: U to y=9\n\n  actions at T6, T7, T8, T9, T10, T11, T12, T13 -> 8 actions.\n\n  Can we skip one action by being at a higher freeway earlier?\n\n  What if we do:\n\n  T6: D to y=4 at T7.\n  T7: S to y=4 at T8.\n  T8: we are at freeway4. Then at T8, can we go to freeway6 in one move? no.\n  or, at T8, we go U to y=5 at T9: unsafe.\n\n  not possible.\n\n  or, at T7, after we are at freeway4, we could go U to freeway5 at T8: unsafe.\n\n  so no.\n\n  or, start with a different move.\n\n  T6: S to y=5 at T7.\n  T7: D to y=4 at T8.\n  T8: S to y=4 at T9.\n  T9: U to y=5 at T10.\n  then same as above.\n\n  still 8.\n\n  So it seems 8 is the minimum.\n\n  But let me try to see if we can be at freeway7 at T7? impossible.\n\n  or freeway8 at T7? impossible.\n\n  So the minimal number of actions is 8.\n\n  Now, we need to output the sequence.\n\n  We have several options. One option is:\n\n      Turn6: S\n      Turn7: D\n      Turn8: S\n      Turn9: U\n      Turn10: U\n      Turn11: U\n      Turn12: U\n      Turn13: U\n\n  This means:\n\n      T6: S -> stay at y=5 at T7.\n      T7: D -> down to y=4 at T8.\n      T8: S -> stay at y=4 at T9.\n      T9: U -> up to y=5 at T10.\n      T10: U -> to y=6 at T11.\n      T11: U -> to y=7 at T12.\n      T12: U -> to y=8 at T13.\n      T13: U -> to y=9 at T14.\n\n  Check the freeways and turns:\n\n      T6: y=5 -> freeway5: safe (unsafe only at T8,9 -> safe at T6)\n      T7: y=5 -> freeway5: safe at T7.\n      T8: y=4 -> freeway4: safe at T8 (unsafe only at T6,10 -> safe)\n      T9: y=4 -> freeway4: safe at T9.\n      T10: y=5 -> freeway5: safe at T10.\n      T11: y=6 -> freeway6: safe (unsafe only at T8 -> safe)\n      T12: y=7 -> freeway7: safe (unsafe only at T8 -> safe)\n      T13: y=8 -> freeway8: safe (unsafe only at T6 -> safe)\n      T14: y=9 -> goal, no freeway.\n\n  So no collision.\n\n  Another option is:\n\n      Turn6: D\n      Turn7: S\n      Turn8: S\n      Turn9: U\n      Turn10: U\n      Turn11: U\n      Turn12: U\n      Turn13: U\n\n  This means:\n\n      T6: D -> to y=4 at T7.\n      T7: S -> to y=4 at T8.\n      T8: S -> to y=4 at T9.\n      T9: U -> to y=5 at T10.\n      then same.\n\n  Check:\n\n      T6: y=5 -> freeway5: safe.\n      T7: y=4 -> freeway4: safe.\n      T8: y=4 -> freeway4: safe.\n      T9: y=4 -> freeway4: safe.\n      T10: y=5 -> freeway5: safe.\n      ... as above.\n\n  Also valid.\n\n  Or:\n\n      Turn6: D\n      Turn7: D\n      Turn8: U\n      Turn9: U\n      Turn10: U\n      Turn11: U\n      Turn12: U\n      Turn13: U\n\n  This means:\n\n      T6: D -> to y=4 at T7.\n      T7: D -> to y=3 at T8.\n      T8: U -> to y=4 at T9.\n      T9: U -> to y=5 at T10.\n      then same.\n\n  Check:\n\n      T6: y=5 -> freeway5: safe.\n      T7: y=4 -> freeway4: safe.\n      T8: y=3 -> freeway3: safe at T8.\n      T9: y=4 -> freeway4: safe.\n      T10: y=5 -> freeway5: safe.\n      ... \n\n  Also valid.\n\n  Any of these 8-action sequences is valid.\n\n  But the problem asks for the minimal number of turns H, and we have H=8.\n\n  Is there a sequence with H=7? We couldn't find one.\n\n  Let me try to see if we can reach in 7 actions (land at y=9 at turn13).\n\n  The player would have to be at y=9 at turn6+7 = turn13.\n\n  The net move is +4 (from y=5 to y=9).\n\n  The actions are 7 actions, each in {U, D, S}, and the sum of the changes must be +4.\n\n  Let u be the number of U, d the number of D, s the number of S.\n  Then u - d = 4, and u + d + s = 7.\n\n  So u = d + 4, then (d+4) + d + s = 7 -> 2d + s = 3.\n\n  Possible: \n      d=0, s=3 -> u=4: then actions: 4U and 3S.\n      d=1, s=1 -> u=5: 5U, 1D, 1S.\n      d=2, s=-1 -> invalid.\n\n  So possible sequences: either 4U and 3S, or 5U, 1D, 1S.\n\n  But we must avoid collisions.\n\n  We start at y=5 at T6.\n\n  Try the first type: 4U and 3S.\n\n  We must end at y=9 at T13.\n\n  We need to distribute the 3S and 4U over the turns.\n\n  The moves must be such that we are never at an unsafe freeway at that turn.\n\n  We must be at freeway5 at some turns, freeway6,7,8.\n\n  The constraints on the freeways:\n\n      freeway5: avoid T8, T9.\n      freeway6: avoid T8.\n      freeway7: avoid T8.\n      freeway8: avoid T6.\n\n  and freeway2,3,4 as needed.\n\n  We will be at freeway5,6,7,8 at some turns.\n\n  The turns are T6 to T12 (because at T13 we are at y=9, so not on a freeway).\n\n  We have to be at freeway8 at some turn: to be at freeway8, we must be at y=8 at that turn.\n\n  Similarly, freeway7 at some turn for y=7, etc.\n\n  The earliest we can be at freeway8 is T7: because to get to y=8 from y=5 in one move is impossible. In two moves: \n        T6: U to y=6 at T7\n        T7: U to y=7 at T8\n        T8: U to y=8 at T9\n  so at the earliest at T9.\n\n  Similarly, to be at freeway7 at the earliest at T8 (from: T6: U to y=6 at T7; T7: U to y=7 at T8).\n\n  But freeway7 is unsafe at T8 -> so we cannot be at freeway7 at T8.\n\n  We must be at freeway7 at a turn not T8. The next available is T9 or later.\n\n  Similarly, freeway6 must not be at T8.\n\n  freeway5 must not be at T8 or T9.\n\n  Suppose we try to be at freeway7 at T9.\n\n  To be at freeway7 (y=7) at T9, then we were at y=6 or y=7 or y=8 at T8.\n\n  But if we are at y=7 at T8, then we are at freeway7 at T8: unsafe.\n\n  if we are at y=6 at T8, then at T8 we are at freeway6: unsafe at T8.\n\n  if we are at y=8 at T8, then we are at freeway8 at T8: safe? freeway8 unsafe only at T6 -> safe at T8. \n\n  So one possibility: be at y=8 at T8.\n\n  How to be at y=8 at T8 from y=5 at T6? \n      T6: action must take us to y= something at T7.\n      T7: action to y= something at T8.\n\n      To be at y=8 at T8, we need to increase by 3 in two actions.\n      So actions: U,U: then \n          T6: U -> y=6 at T7\n          T7: U -> y=7 at T8 -> not 8.\n      U and then? or D or S? cannot.\n\n      We need three ups: but only two actions: impossible.\n\n  So we cannot be at y=8 at T8.\n\n  Therefore, we cannot avoid being at freeway6 or freeway7 at T8 if we want to be at freeway7 at T9.\n\n  But freeway6 and freeway7 are both unsafe at T8.\n\n  Therefore, we cannot be at freeway7 at T9? because to be there, we would have to be at freeway6 or freeway7 or freeway8 at T8, and freeway6 and 7 are unsafe, and freeway8 is safe but we cannot reach it in two moves.\n\n  So we must be at freeway7 at a turn later than T9.\n\n  Similarly, freeway6 must be at a turn not T8.\n\n  The earliest we can be at freeway7 is T9, but we just saw it's not possible without being at an unsafe freeway at T8.\n\n  What about T10 for freeway7? \n      To be at freeway7 (y=7) at T10, then at T9 we were at y=6,7, or 8.\n      If at T9 we are at y=6, then we are at freeway6 at T9: safe? (unsafe only at T8 -> safe).\n      If at T9 we are at y=7, then freeway7 at T9: safe (unsafe only at T8 -> safe).\n      If at T9 we are at y=8, then freeway8 at T9: safe.\n\n  So we can be at freeway7 at T10.\n\n  Then the path might be:\n\n      T6: start at y=5.\n      We want to be at freeway7 at T10 (y=7 at T10).\n\n      Then from y=5 to y=7 in 4 actions (from T6 to T9: because at T10 we are at y=7).\n\n      Net change: +2.\n\n      We have 4 actions: T6, T7, T8, T9.\n\n      Let the actions be a6, a7, a8, a9.\n\n      Then the changes: a6+a7+a8+a9 = +2, where each in { -1,0,1 }.\n\n      Then we go to freeway7 at T10, then from there to y=9 in 2 moves: \n          T10: U to y=8 at T11\n          T11: U to y=9 at T12\n      so two more actions.\n\n      Total actions: 6 actions? but wait, we have to account for the moves to avoid the unsafe freeways.\n\n      But we are not done: we have to be at freeway8 at some turn? to be at y=8.\n\n      In this plan, we are at y=8 at T11.\n\n      So we are at freeway8 at T11: safe.\n\n      So the actions would be for turns T6 to T11: 6 actions.\n\n      But is that possible? \n\n      We need to go from y=5 at T6 to y=7 at T10 (which is after 4 actions: T6, T7, T8, T9).\n\n      The net change from T6 to T10 in y is +2.\n\n      With 4 actions, we can do for example: U, U, S, S -> \n          T6: U -> y=6 at T7\n          T7: U -> y=7 at T8  -> but at T8, we are at freeway7: unsafe! -> not allowed.\n      or U, S, U, S ->\n          T6: U -> y=6 at T7\n          T7: S -> y=6 at T8  -> freeway6 at T8: unsafe -> not allowed.\n      or D, U, U, U -> \n          T6: D -> y=4 at T7\n          T7: U -> y=5 at T8  -> freeway5 at T8: unsafe -> not allowed.\n      or S, U, U, S ->\n          T6: S -> y=5 at T7\n          T7: U -> y=6 at T8  -> freeway6 at T8: unsafe.\n\n      How about: \n          T6: S -> y=5 at T7  [freeway5: safe]\n          T7: S -> y=5 at T8  [freeway5: unsafe at T8] -> not allowed.\n\n      or:\n          T6: D -> y=4 at T7  [freeway4: safe]\n          T7: S -> y=4 at T8  [freeway4: safe]\n          T8: U -> y=5 at T9  [freeway5: unsafe at T9] -> not allowed.\n          T9: U -> y=6 at T10  [freeway6: safe]\n\n      But then at T10 we are at y=6, not y=7.\n\n      To be at y=7 at T10, we need to have more ups.\n\n      For example: \n          T6: D -> to y=4 at T7  [safe]\n          T7: U -> to y=5 at T8  [unsafe] -> not allowed.\n\n      or:\n          T6: D -> y=4 at T7\n          T7: D -> y=3 at T8  [freeway3: safe]\n          T8: U -> y=4 at T9  [freeway4: safe]\n          T9: U -> y=5 at T10  [freeway5: safe at T10] -> but we wanted y=7 at T10, this is only y=5.\n\n      So to get to y=7 at T10, we would need to do more than two ups in the last two turns? impossible.\n\n      We need at least three ups in the four actions.\n\n      But then we will be at a higher freeway earlier and might hit an unsafe turn.\n\n      For example: \n        actions: U, U, U, D (net +2)\n        T6: U -> y=6 at T7  [freeway6: safe at T7]\n        T7: U -> y=7 at T8  [freeway7: unsafe at T8] -> not allowed.\n\n      or: U, U, D, U: \n        T6: U -> y=6 at T7\n        T7: U -> y=7 at T8  [unsafe]\n\n      or: U, D, U, U:\n        T6: U -> y=6 at T7\n        T7: D -> y=5 at T8  [freeway5: unsafe at T8]\n\n      or: D, U, U, U:\n        T6: D -> y=4 at T7\n        T7: U -> y=5 at T8  [unsafe]\n\n      or: S, U, U, U:\n        T6: S -> y=5 at T7\n        T7: U -> y=6 at T8  [freeway6: unsafe]\n\n      So every way to get to y=7 at T10 in 4 actions seems to require being at an unsafe freeway at T8 or T9.\n\n  Therefore, it is not possible in 7 actions.\n\n  Hence, the minimal H is 8.\n\n  We can choose any of the 8-action sequences that work.\n\n  Let's choose the first one I thought of:\n\n      Turn6: S\n      Turn7: D\n      Turn8: S\n      Turn9: U\n      Turn10: U\n      Turn11: U\n      Turn12: U\n      Turn13: U\n\n  But wait, at the last moves, from T9 to T10: U from y=4 to y=5.\n  Then T10: U to y=6\n  T11: U to y=7\n  T12: U to y=8\n  T13: U to y=9\n\n  So the actions from T9 to T13 are 5 U's? That's 5 U's, but we only need 5 to go from y=4 to y=9? \n\n  From y=4 to y=9 requires 5 U's.\n\n  But in our sequence, we are at T9: y=4, then after 5 U's, we are at y=9 at T14.\n\n  And we have actions at T9, T10, T11, T12, T13 -> 5 actions, plus the first three: T6, T7, T8 -> total 8 actions.\n\n  But the net from start (y=5) to end (y=9) is +4, and we did: \n      T6: S -> 0\n      T7: D -> -1\n      T8: S -> 0\n      then T9 to T13: 5U -> +5\n      total: 0 -1 +0 +5 = +4 -> correct.\n\n  And the safety we already checked.\n\n  Alternatively, to have only 4 U's at the end, we would have to be at y=5 at T9, but we cannot because freeway5 is unsafe at T9.\n\n  In this sequence, we are at y=5 at T10, which is safe.\n\n  So it's fine.\n\n  We output:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 6: S\nTurn 7: D\nTurn 8: S\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\n}\n\n  But note: the current turn is t1=6, so the actions are for turns 6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13.\n\n  And after the action at turn13, at turn14, we are at (0,9).\n\n  So H=8.\n\n  Let me write it in the format.\n\n  Note: the sequence is for t=0 to H-1, which is 8 actions.\n\n  So the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 6: S\nTurn 7: D\nTurn 8: S\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\n}\n\n  But to be safe, let me verify the positions and freeways at each turn:\n\n  Turn6 (before action): y=5.\n  Action at Turn6: S -> at Turn7: y=5.  [freeway5 at turn7: safe? turn7: not in {8,9} -> safe]\n  Turn7: action D -> at Turn8: y=4.  [freeway4 at turn8: unsafe at turn8? we have freeway4 unsafe at T6,10 -> safe at T8]\n  Turn8: action S -> at Turn9: y=4.  [freeway4 at turn9: safe (unsafe only at T6,10)]\n  Turn9: action U -> at Turn10: y=5.  [freeway5 at turn10: safe (unsafe at T8,9 -> safe at T10)]\n  Turn10: action U -> at Turn11: y=6.  [freeway6 at turn11: safe (unsafe only at T8)]\n  Turn11: action U -> at Turn12: y=7.  [freeway7 at turn12: safe (unsafe only at T8)]\n  Turn12: action U -> at Turn13: y=8.  [freeway8 at turn13: safe (unsafe only at T6)]\n  Turn13: action U -> at Turn14: y=9.  [goal]\n\n  And no turn from 6 to 13 has the player on an unsafe freeway.\n\n  So it is correct.\n\n  We can also output the sequence that moves down twice then up, but this one is also fine.\n\n  Therefore, the answer is as above.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns to reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 5) at turn 6, while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways, is 8 turns. The sequence of actions ensures the player moves safely by avoiding freeways when they are unsafe (i.e., when a car's span includes x=0 at that turn).\n\n- At turn 6, the player starts at y=5 (freeway 5). Freeway 5 is safe at turn 6 (unsafe only at turns 8 and 9).\n- Action at turn 6 is S (stay), so at turn 7, y=5 (still freeway 5). Freeway 5 is safe at turn 7.\n- Action at turn 7 is D (down), so at turn 8, y=4 (freeway 4). Freeway 4 is safe at turn 8 (unsafe only at turns 6 and 10).\n- Action at turn 8 is S (stay), so at turn 9, y=4 (freeway 4). Freeway 4 is safe at turn 9.\n- Action at turn 9 is U (up), so at turn 10, y=5 (freeway 5). Freeway 5 is safe at turn 10 (unsafe only at turns 8 and 9).\n- Action at turn 10 is U (up), so at turn 11, y=6 (freeway 6). Freeway 6 is safe at turn 11 (unsafe only at turn 8).\n- Action at turn 11 is U (up), so at turn 12, y=7 (freeway 7). Freeway 7 is safe at turn 12 (unsafe only at turn 8).\n- Action at turn 12 is U (up), so at turn 13, y=8 (freeway 8). Freeway 8 is safe at turn 13 (unsafe only at turn 6).\n- Action at turn 13 is U (up), so at turn 14, y=9, reaching the goal.\n\nThis sequence avoids all unsafe freeways at critical turns and minimizes the number of actions to 8.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 6: S\nTurn 7: D\nTurn 8: S\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get the player from (0,5) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t_1 = 7, but since we're starting from this turn, I'll just think of it as time t=0 for simplicity, so the player starts at y=5 at time t=0, and I need to reach y=9 at some time T with no collisions along the way.\n\nThe actions are U (up, increasing y by 1), D (down, decreasing y by 1), or S (stay, y unchanged). y must stay between 0 and 9 inclusive.\n\nNow, the cars: for each freeway, there are cars moving left or right with given positions and speeds. Collision occurs only if at time T, the player is on a freeway y, and for that y, there is a car such that 0 is in its span at time T. Importantly, when you move to a new freeway, you are not on that freeway until the next turn. So if you move from y to y+1 at time T, you are on y at time T, and on y+1 at time T+1. So you only check the car on your current y at each time.\n\nLet me denote the time elapsed from now. At time t (relative to now, so absolute time is t_1 + t), the player is at some y_t.\n\nI need to find a sequence of actions that gets me to y=9 quickly without any collision.\n\nFirst, I should understand where the cars are at each future time to know when it's safe to be on each freeway.\n\nThe car positions are given at time t_1 = 7, but since we're starting from there, I'll set t=0 as the current time for simplicity. So at t=0, the cars are as given.\n\nFor each freeway k (1 to 8), and for each car on it, I have the head, tail, direction, and speed.\n\nDirection: right means moving right, so position increases; left means moving left, position decreases.\n\nThe span is given as (head, tail). For right-moving cars, head is the front, so if it's moving right, head is larger than tail? Let's see the update.\n\nFrom the update rule:\n\nFor left-moving car: span at t=0 is [h, τ], and at time T, it becomes [h - s*T, τ - s*T]\n\nSince it's moving left, decreasing position.\n\nFor right-moving: span at t=0 is [τ, h]? It says: Span(t_1) = [τ, h] for right-moving? No.\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\nFor left-moving: \"Span(t_1) = [h, τ]\" and then at T, [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nBut in the notation, h and τ are positions, I assume.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving: \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h]\" → at T, [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nIn the right-moving case, it says Span(t_1) = [τ, h], so τ is the tail, h is head, so for right-moving, head is larger, tail smaller.\n\nIn the left-moving, Span(t_1) = [h, τ], so h is head, but since moving left, head might be smaller? It's inconsistent.\n\nLet's see the values.\n\nFor example, freeway 1: (96,49, right, 48) so head=96, tail=49, direction right, speed 48.\n\nSpan at t_1: for right-moving, it says [τ, h] = [49,96]? But in the table it's given as (head, tail), so (96,49) meaning head=96, tail=49? But in the direction, it's right, so moving right, head should be the front.\n\nIn the update, for right-moving, Span(t_1) = [τ, h] = [49,96], and at time T, [49 + 48(T-t_1), 96 + 48(T-t_1)]\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, freeway 8: (-60, -25, left, 36), Span(t_1) = [h, τ] = [-60, -25], and at T, [-60 -36(T-t_1), -25 -36(T-t_1)]\n\nNow, collision occurs if at time T, for the freeway y_T, there is a car such that 0 is in the span at that time.\n\nThat is, for some car on freeway y_T, min_span <= 0 <= max_span at time T.\n\nSince the span is an interval, 0 must be between the left and right endpoints.\n\nFor a car, at time T, the span is [L(T), R(T)] where for left-moving: L(T) = h - s(T-t_1), R(T) = τ - s(T-t_1)\n\nFor right-moving: L(T) = τ + s(T-t_1), R(T) = h + s(T-t_1)\n\nAnd collision if y_T = k and for some car on k, L(T) <= 0 <= R(T)\n\nNow, t_1 = 7, but since we're setting t=0 relative, let me define τ = T - t_1, so time from now.\n\nSet t = 0 at current turn.\n\nSo at time t >= 0, for a car with initial head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s.\n\nIf d = left, position at time t: L(t) = h - s*t, R(t) = τ - s*t? No.\n\nAt time t (elapsed), the span is:\n\nFor left-moving: [h - s t, τ - s t] but since h and τ are positions at t=0, and moving left, if h is the head at t=0, then at time t, head is at h - s t, tail at τ - s t.\n\nBut in the left-moving case, if head is at left, then at t=0, [h, τ] with h < τ? In freeway 8, (-60, -25, left), so h=-60, τ=-25, so h < τ, so the car is from -60 to -25, with head at -25? I'm confused.\n\nPerhaps the head is always the front.\n\nFor left-moving car, moving left, so front is smaller x.\n\nIn freeway 8, head = -60, tail = -25, direction left, so at t=0, the car spans from x= -60 to x= -25, with front at x= -60 (most left), so as it moves left, x decreases.\n\nAt time t, front at -60 - s t, back at -25 - s t, so span [ -60 -36t, -25 -36t ]\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving, freeway 1: head=96, tail=49, direction right, so at t=0, front at 96, back at 49, span [49,96]? But in the update, it says for right-moving, Span(t_1) = [τ, h] = [49,96], so L=49, R=96.\n\nAt time t, L(t) = 49 + 48t, R(t) = 96 + 48t.\n\nSo in general, for any car, the span at time t is [L(t), R(t)] where:\n\n- If right-moving: L(t) = tail + s t, R(t) = head + s t\n\n- If left-moving: L(t) = head - s t, R(t) = tail - s t\n\nAnd collision if at time t, player on freeway y, and for some car on that freeway, L(t) <= 0 <= R(t)\n\nNow, since the player starts at y=5 at t=0, and needs to reach y=9.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, I think, since no cars on them. Freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 should be safe, no cars to collide with.\n\nThe vertical axis is y=0,1,2,...,9, and cars are on freeways y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, so no cars, so safe.\n\nPlayer can be at y=0 or y=9 without collision.\n\nNow, to reach (0,9), so y=9.\n\nNow, the player can move up, down, or stay.\n\nMinimal turns to reach y=9 from y=5, but with obstacles, so it might not be straight up.\n\nSince we can only change y by at most 1 per turn, the minimum time is at least 4 turns (from 5 to 6,7,8,9), but might be more if we have to avoid cars.\n\nBut we might need to stay or go down sometimes to avoid collision.\n\nNow, I need to simulate the car positions over time to see when each freeway is safe at position x=0.\n\nSince the player is always at x=0, we only care about whether at time t, for each freeway k, if the player is on k, is 0 in the span of any car on k at that time.\n\nSo for each freeway k, and each car on k, we can find the times when 0 is in its span.\n\nThen, the freeway k is unsafe at time t if for any car on k, 0 is in its span at t. Otherwise, it's safe.\n\nBut there might be multiple cars, so we need the union over cars.\n\nSince the collision is per car, but for the freeway, it's unsafe if at least one car causes collision.\n\nSo let's list all cars and when they cover x=0.\n\nFirst, for each freeway, list the cars.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: right-moving, tail=49, head=96, speed=48\n\nL(t) = 49 + 48t, R(t) = 96 + 48t\n\n0 in span when L(t) <= 0 <= R(t)\n\n49 + 48t <= 0 and 0 <= 96 + 48t\n\nSince 96 + 48t >0 for all t>=0, always true.\n\n49 + 48t <=0 ⇒ 48t <= -49 ⇒ t <= -49/48 <0, impossible since t>=0.\n\nSo for all t>=0, L(t) =49+48t >=49>0, so 0 < L(t) <= R(t), so 0 not in [L,R], so this car never covers x=0. Safe for freeway 1 at all times.\n\nL(t) =49+48t >=49>0, so min is >0, so 0 never covered. Yes.\n\nFreeway 1 has only one car, so freeway 1 is always safe.\n\nNow freeway 2: three cars, all right-moving, speed=4.\n\nFirst car: tail=-36, head=-47? The table says: (-36, -47, right, 4)\n\nIt says (head, tail), so head=-36, tail=-47? But for right-moving, head should be larger.\n\nPerhaps I misread.\n\nIn the table: \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nFor freeway 2: \"(-36, -47, right, 4)\" so head=-36, tail=-47? But -36 > -47, so if right-moving, head at -36, tail at -47, so span from -47 to -36? Then at t=0, L= τ = -47, R= h = -36.\n\nThen L(t) = τ + s t = -47 + 4t, R(t) = h + s t = -36 + 4t\n\n0 in span when -47 +4t <=0 and 0 <= -36 +4t? 0 <= -36 +4t ⇒ 4t >=36 ⇒ t>=9\n\nAnd -47+4t <=0 ⇒ 4t <=47 ⇒ t<=11.75\n\nSo for t from 9 to 11 inclusive? t integer? Turns are discrete, I assume t integer.\n\nt is turn number, so integer.\n\nt>=0 integer.\n\nSo at t=9: L(9) = -47 + 36 = -11, R(9) = -36 + 36 =0\n\n0 <= R(9) =0, and L(9)= -11 <=0, so 0 in span.\n\nAt t=10: L= -47+40= -7, R= -36+40=4, both <=0 and >=0? -7<=0, 4>=0, 0 in between.\n\nAt t=11: L= -47+44= -3, R= -36+44=8, 0 in.\n\nAt t=12: L= -47+48=1, R= -36+48=12, L=1>0, so 0 not in [1,12]\n\nSimilarly, t=8: L= -47+32= -15, R= -36+32= -4, both negative, R=-4<0, so 0 not in.\n\nSo car 1 on freeway 2 covers x=0 from t=9 to t=11 inclusive.\n\nNow second car on freeway 2: (40, 29, right, 4) head=40, tail=29\n\nL(t) =29 +4t, R(t)=40+4t\n\n0 in span? 29+4t <=0 and 0<=40+4t\n\n0<=40+4t always true for t>=0.\n\n29+4t <=0 ⇒ 4t <= -29 ⇒ t <= -7.25, impossible. So never covers x=0.\n\nThird car: (4, -7, right, 4) head=4, tail=-7\n\nL(t) = -7 +4t, R(t)=4+4t\n\n0 in span when -7+4t <=0 and 0<=4+4t\n\n0<=4+4t always true.\n\n-7+4t <=0 ⇒ 4t <=7 ⇒ t<=1.75\n\nSince t integer, t<=1\n\nAlso, R(t)=4+4t >0 for t>=0, so only need L(t)<=0.\n\nL(t)<=0 when -7+4t <=0, t<=7/4=1.75, so t=0,1\n\nAt t=0: L= -7, R=4, -7<=0<=4, yes\n\nt=1: L= -7+4= -3, R=4+4=8, -3<=0<=8, yes\n\nt=2: L= -7+8=1, R=8, 1>0, not covered.\n\nSo car 3 covers x=0 at t=0 and t=1.\n\nNow for freeway 2, unsafe if any car covers x=0 at that time.\n\nCar 3 at t=0 and t=1\n\nCar 1 at t=9,10,11\n\nCar 2 never.\n\nSo at t=0: car 3 covers, unsafe\n\nt=1: car 3 covers, unsafe\n\nt=2 to 8: no car covers? Car 1 at t=9-11, car 3 only at 0,1, so t=2 to 8, all cars not covering, so safe?\n\nt=2: car 3 not, car 1 not yet, car 2 never, so safe.\n\nSimilarly t=3 to 8 safe.\n\nt=9,10,11 unsafe due to car 1.\n\nt=12 and later: car 1 not, others not, safe.\n\nBut car 1 at t=9,10,11.\n\nt=9,10,11 unsafe.\n\nNow freeway 3: two cars, both right-moving, speed 12.\n\nFirst car: (12, 1, right, 12) head=12, tail=1\n\nL(t)=1 +12t, R(t)=12+12t\n\n0 in span: 1+12t <=0? 1+12t >0 for all t>=0, so never <=0, so 0 not in, since L>0.\n\nSimilarly, second car: (-36, -47, right, 12) head=-36, tail=-47\n\nL(t)= -47 +12t, R(t)= -36 +12t\n\n0 in span: -47+12t <=0 and 0<= -36+12t\n\nFirst, 0<= -36+12t ⇒ 12t >=36 ⇒ t>=3\n\nAnd -47+12t <=0 ⇒ 12t <=47 ⇒ t<=47/12=3.916, so t<=3 since integer? t>=3 and t<=3.916, so t=3,4? Let's see.\n\nt=3: L= -47+36= -11, R= -36+36=0, so -11<=0<=0? 0<=0 true, so yes.\n\nt=4: L= -47+48=1, R= -36+48=12, L=1>0, not covered.\n\n0<= R(t) at t=3: R=0, 0<=0 true.\n\nAt t=4, R=12>0, but L=1>0, not covered.\n\nAlso, for t=3: L=-11<=0, R=0>=0, so 0 in.\n\nt=4: L=1>0, not.\n\nt=2: L= -47+24= -23, R= -36+24= -12, both <0, R=-12<0, so 0 not in.\n\nSo only at t=3.\n\nt=3: covered.\n\nNow, first car never covers.\n\nSo freeway 3 unsafe only at t=3.\n\nFreeway 4: same as freeway 3? Cars: (12,1,right,12) and (-36,-47,right,12)\n\nExactly the same as freeway 3.\n\nSo unsafe only at t=3.\n\nNow freeway 5: two cars, both right-moving, speed 6.\n\nFirst car: (-6,-17,right,6) head=-6, tail=-17\n\nL(t)= -17 +6t, R(t)= -6 +6t\n\n0 in span: -17+6t <=0 and 0<= -6+6t\n\n0<= -6+6t ⇒ 6t >=6 ⇒ t>=1\n\n-17+6t <=0 ⇒ 6t <=17 ⇒ t<=17/6≈2.833, so t<=2\n\nt>=1 and t<=2, so t=1,2\n\nAt t=1: L= -17+6= -11, R= -6+6=0, -11<=0<=0, yes\n\nt=2: L= -17+12= -5, R= -6+12=6, -5<=0<=6, yes\n\nt=3: L= -17+18=1, R= -6+18=12, L=1>0, not\n\nSecond car: (42,31,right,6) head=42, tail=31\n\nL(t)=31+6t, R(t)=42+6t, both >0 for t>=0, never covers x=0.\n\nSo freeway 5 unsafe at t=1 and t=2.\n\nFreeway 6: one car, left-moving: (24,47,left,24) head=24, tail=47? Direction left.\n\nSpan at t=0: [h, τ] = [24,47]? But moving left, so L(t) = h - s t =24 -24t, R(t) = τ - s t =47 -24t\n\n0 in span when 24-24t <=0 and 0<=47-24t\n\nFirst, 24-24t <=0 ⇒ 24t >=24 ⇒ t>=1\n\nSecond, 0<=47-24t ⇒ 24t <=47 ⇒ t<=47/24≈1.958, so t<=1\n\nt>=1 and t<=1, so t=1\n\nAt t=1: L=24-24=0, R=47-24=23, 0<=0<=23, yes.\n\nAt t=0: L=24>0, R=47>0, not covered.\n\nt=2: L=24-48= -24, R=47-48= -1, both negative, not covered.\n\nSo unsafe only at t=1.\n\nFreeway 7: same as freeway 6? (24,47,left,24) same, so unsafe only at t=1.\n\nFreeway 8: one car, left-moving: (-60,-25,left,36) head=-60, tail=-25\n\nL(t) = h - s t = -60 -36t, R(t) = τ - s t = -25 -36t\n\n0 in span: -60-36t <=0 and 0<= -25-36t\n\nFirst, -60-36t <=0 always true since negative.\n\nSecond, 0<= -25-36t ⇒ -36t >=25 ⇒ t <= -25/36 <0, impossible.\n\nSo 0 not in span for all t, since R(t) = -25-36t <0 for all t>=0.\n\nSo freeway 8 always safe.\n\nNow summarize safety per freeway over time.\n\ny=1: always safe\n\ny=2: unsafe at t=0,1,9,10,11; safe at t=2-8, t>=12\n\ny=3: unsafe at t=3; safe otherwise\n\ny=4: same as y=3, unsafe at t=3, safe otherwise\n\ny=5: unsafe at t=1,2; safe otherwise\n\ny=6: unsafe at t=1; safe otherwise\n\ny=7: unsafe at t=1; safe otherwise\n\ny=8: always safe\n\ny=0 and y=9: always safe, no cars.\n\nPlayer starts at y=5 at t=0.\n\nAt t=0, y=5 is unsafe because freeway 5 is unsafe at t=0? Freeway 5 unsafe at t=1 and 2, but at t=0?\n\nFor freeway 5, we have unsafe at t=1 and 2.\n\nAt t=0: for freeway 5, first car: L(t)= -17+6t, at t=0, L= -17, R= -6, both negative, so 0 not covered? Earlier I said unsafe only t=1,2.\n\nAt t=0: L= -17, R= -6, min=-17, max=-6, both <0, so 0 not in [-17,-6], so safe.\n\nSimilarly, second car not cover.\n\nSo freeway 5 safe at t=0.\n\nBut at t=0, player is on y=5, and freeway 5 safe at t=0.\n\nNow, unsafe times:\n\ny=2: unsafe t=0,1,9,10,11\n\nt=0: unsafe\n\nt=1: unsafe\n\nt=9-11: unsafe\n\ny=3: unsafe only t=3\n\ny=4: unsafe only t=3\n\ny=5: unsafe t=1,2\n\ny=6: unsafe t=1\n\ny=7: unsafe t=1\n\ny=1: safe all t\n\ny=8: safe all t\n\ny=0 and y=9 safe.\n\nPlayer at t=0, y=5, which is safe.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nMinimum time: from y=5 to y=9, difference 4, so at least 4 turns: t=0 to t=4, for example.\n\nBut at each step, we need to be safe.\n\nLet me list the y position over time.\n\nAt t=0: y=5, safe.\n\nNow, we need to choose actions: U, D, S.\n\nGoal: minimize H, the number of turns to reach y=9.\n\nH is the number of actions, and after H-1 turns, we reach y=9? Let's see.\n\nSequence of actions from t=0 to H-1, so at time t, after action, position at time t+1? I need to clarify the timing.\n\nDefine the state.\n\nAt time t (after t actions, or before?)\n\nFrom the player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, where Δy_t depends on a_t.\n\nAnd a_t is action at turn t_1 + t, I think.\n\nIn the problem: \"sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\"\n\nAnd y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t with a_t.\n\nSo at turn t_1 + t, we apply a_t, then y_{t+1} is the new position.\n\nBut for collision, at turn T, which is t_1 + t, the position y_T is used to check collision with cars at that turn.\n\nLet's read.\n\n\"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd \"turn T\" is the time.\n\nAlso, \"when you decide to move to y_{T+1} != y_T at turn T, you are not on y_{T+1} at turn T, so not collided by cars on y_{T+1} if they cover at T but not at T+1.\"\n\nBut in this case, at turn T, you are on y_T, so you only care about cars on y_T at time T.\n\nIn the sequence, at each turn t (relative), time t, position y_t, we are on freeway y_t at time t, and check collision based on that.\n\nThen we apply action a_t, move to y_{t+1}.\n\nWe start at t=0, y_0 = 5.\n\nWe need to find a sequence such that for some H, at time H-1? After H actions? Let's see the indices.\n\nThe sequence {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nAfter applying a_{t_1 + H-1}, we reach position at turn t_1 + H.\n\nThe position at turn t_1 + t is y_{t_1 + t}, for t=0 to H.\n\nAt turn t_1 + t, position y_{t_1 + t}.\n\nWe start at t=0: turn t_1, position y_{t_1} =5.\n\nAfter action a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, we have positions up to y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nWe want y_{t_1 + H} =9? Or at the turn when we reach.\n\nThe task: \"reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H - 1\" or something?\n\nLet's read: \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence {a_{t_1 + t}_{t=0}^{H-1} such that y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\ny_{t_1 + H - 1} =9.\n\nAnd the actions are from t=0 to H-1, so we apply H actions.\n\nAt time t_1 + t for t=0, we apply a_{t_1 + 0} to go from y_{t_1} to y_{t_1 +1}, I think.\n\nStandard: at turn T, we are at position y_T, then we apply action a_T, then we move to y_{T+1}.\n\nSo for turn sequence: turn T: position y_T, apply a_T, go to y_{T+1}.\n\nCollision checked at turn T based on y_T and cars at T.\n\nWe start at turn t_1, y_{t_1} =5.\n\nWe apply actions a_{t_1}, a_{t_1+1}, ..., up to a_{t_1 + H-1}, and after that, we are at position y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nBut we want y_{t_1 + H - 1} =9.\n\ny_{t_1 + H - 1} =9 means that at turn t_1 + H -1, we are at position 9.\n\nThen we apply a_{t_1 + H-1} but since we are already at 9, if we apply S, we stay, or U/D, but y must be in [0,9], so if at 9, U is invalid? But the position is clipped, I think.\n\nIn the update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, but clipped to [0,9], so if at y_t=9, a_t=U, then y_{t+1} = min(9+1,9)=9, similarly for D at 0.\n\nSo it stays.\n\nBut for reaching, y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, so at turn t_1 + H-1, we are at 9.\n\nThen the last action might be to stay or move, but since we are at 9, moving up does nothing.\n\nIn terms of turns, H is the number of turns from start to reach, including the start or not?\n\ny_{t_1 + H -1} =9, so at time t_1 + H -1, we are at 9.\n\nSince we start at t_1, time from start: let τ = 0 at t_1, so at time τ, position y_τ.\n\nWe have y_0 =5.\n\nWe apply actions a_0 to a_{H-1}, and y_{H-1} =9? Indices.\n\nSet τ from 0.\n\nAt time τ (relative), position y_τ.\n\nFor τ=0, y_0=5.\n\nWe apply a_τ at time τ, to determine y_{τ+1}.\n\nThen after applying a_{H-1} at time H-1, we have y_H.\n\nBut we want y_{H-1} =9? Confusing.\n\nFrom the problem: we want y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nWith t_1 + H -1 being the turn when we are at 9.\n\nAt that turn, we apply an action, but the position is already 9 before action? No.\n\nAt turn T, we are at y_T, then apply a_T, go to y_{T+1}.\n\nSo at turn T, position y_T is given, then we do action.\n\nThe condition is that at each turn T, when we are at y_T, it is safe, no collision.\n\nThen we want for some T, y_T =9.\n\nAnd T = t_1 + H -1 for some H.\n\nSince t_1 is fixed, let's work with relative time.\n\nLet t be the time index from start, t=0,1,2,...\n\nAt time t, position y_t.\n\nAt time t=0, y_0 =5.\n\nAfter action at time t, we go to y_{t+1}.\n\nWe want y_t =9 for some t, with minimal t.\n\nSince from y=5 to y=9, min t=4, but with obstacles, might be later.\n\nt is the time when we are at position.\n\nAt time t=0, y=5.\n\nWe want y_t=9 for some t.\n\nThe sequence of actions is from time t=0 to t=H-1, where after H actions, we have positions up to y_H, but we want y_{H-1} or something.\n\nSet T as the time when y_T=9.\n\nThen T must be at least 4, since y_0=5, y_1, y_2, y_3, y_4 at earliest 9.\n\ny_0=5, after 4 actions, y_4=9 at earliest.\n\nBut y_t = y_0 + sum of Δy up to t-1? Let's define.\n\nAt time t, before action, position y_t.\n\nThen apply action a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nBut for collision, at time t, when we are at y_t, we check if collision occurs based on cars at time t.\n\nThen we apply a_t to move to y_{t+1} for time t+1.\n\nWe start at t=0, y_0 given.\n\nWe want y_T =9 for some T.\n\nThe actions are a_0 to a_{T-1}, since to go from y_0 to y_T, we need T actions? From t=0 to t=T, we have T+1 positions, but actions from 0 to T-1.\n\ny_0 to y_1 with a_0, y_1 to y_2 with a_1, ..., y_{T-1} to y_T with a_{T-1}.\n\nSo to reach y_T, we apply actions at t=0 to t=T-1.\n\nThe number of turns to reach is T, since we are at position at time T.\n\nThe minimal H such that y_{H-1} =9 with t_1 + H-1, but in relative, let's say we want min T such that y_T=9, with T>=0.\n\nT=0, y_0=5≠9.\n\nT=1, y_1 could be 4,5,6.\n\n...\n\nMin T=4 if possible.\n\nThe sequence of actions has length T, from a_0 to a_{T-1}.\n\nFor the output, it's the actions from turn t_1 to t_1 + T-1.\n\nBut in the answer, it's for turns starting from t_1.\n\nBut we can think in relative time.\n\nI am considering t from 0.\n\nWe need to find a path from t=0, y=5 to some t, y=9, with min t, and at each step, when at (t,y_t), it is safe, meaning no collision on freeway y_t at time t.\n\nThen action a_t determines Δy to go to y_{t+1}.\n\ny_t in [0,9].\n\nNow, from safety, per time t, which y are safe.\n\nAt each t, safe y:\n\nt=0:\n\ny=0: safe\n\ny=1: safe\n\ny=2: unsafe (from earlier)\n\ny=3: safe (unsafe only at t=3)\n\ny=4: safe (unsafe at t=3)\n\ny=5: safe (unsafe at t=1,2)\n\ny=6: unsafe (at t=1, but t=0 safe? y=6 unsafe at t=1, but at t=0?\n\nFreeway 6 unsafe only at t=1, so at t=0, safe.\n\nSimilarly y=7 unsafe at t=1, so t=0 safe.\n\ny=8 safe.\n\ny=9 safe.\n\nAt t=0, y=2 is unsafe, others safe.\n\nPlayer at y=5, safe.\n\nNow t=1:\n\ny=0: safe\n\ny=1: safe\n\ny=2: unsafe (t=1 unsafe)\n\ny=3: safe (unsafe at t=3)\n\ny=4: safe\n\ny=5: unsafe (t=1 unsafe)\n\ny=6: unsafe (t=1 unsafe)\n\ny=7: unsafe (t=1 unsafe)\n\ny=8: safe\n\ny=9: safe\n\nSo at t=1, safe y: 0,1,3,4,8,9\n\ny=2,5,6,7 unsafe.\n\nt=2:\n\ny=0 safe\n\ny=1 safe\n\ny=2 safe? y=2 unsafe at t=0,1,9,10,11; t=2 to8 safe, so at t=2, safe.\n\ny=3 safe (unsafe only t=3)\n\ny=4 safe\n\ny=5 unsafe (t=2 unsafe)\n\ny=6 safe (unsafe only t=1)\n\ny=7 safe (unsafe only t=1)\n\ny=8 safe\n\ny=9 safe\n\nSo safe at t=2: y=0,1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9; only y=5 unsafe.\n\ny=5 unsafe at t=1 and 2.\n\nt=3:\n\ny=0 safe\n\ny=1 safe\n\ny=2 safe (t=3 not unsafe time)\n\ny=3 unsafe (t=3 unsafe)\n\ny=4 unsafe (t=3 unsafe)\n\ny=5 safe (unsafe t=1,2, not t=3)\n\ny=6 safe\n\ny=7 safe\n\ny=8 safe\n\ny=9 safe\n\nSo at t=3, unsafe y=3 and 4.\n\nSafe: 0,1,2,5,6,7,8,9\n\nt=4:\n\ny=0 safe\n\ny=1 safe\n\ny=2 safe (t=4 not 0,1,9-11)\n\ny=3 safe (unsafe only t=3)\n\ny=4 safe\n\ny=5 safe\n\ny=6 safe\n\ny=7 safe\n\ny=8 safe\n\ny=9 safe\n\nAll safe except possibly, but at t=4, no unsafe freeways.\n\ny=2 unsafe only at t=0,1,9,10,11; t=4 not, so safe.\n\nOthers safe.\n\nSimilarly t=5 to8 all should be safe, since no unsafe times except specific.\n\nt=5:\n\ny=2 safe, etc.\n\nNow t=9:\n\ny=2 unsafe\n\nothers? y=1 safe, y=3 safe, etc., only y=2 unsafe at t=9,10,11.\n\nBut we might not care about later times if we reach early.\n\nNow, player starts at t=0, y=5.\n\nWe want to reach y=9 asap.\n\nPossible actions: U, D, S.\n\nFrom y=5 at t=0, safe.\n\nAt t=1, we need to be at a safe y for t=1.\n\nSafe y at t=1: 0,1,3,4,8,9\n\nBut from y=5, possible moves:\n\n- U: to y=6\n\nBut y=6 at t=1 is unsafe, collision.\n\n- D: to y=4\n\ny=4 at t=1 is safe? At t=1, y=4 is safe, yes.\n\n- S: to y=5\n\nBut y=5 at t=1 is unsafe.\n\nSo from y=5 at t=0, if we go U to y=6 at t=1, unsafe.\n\nIf go D to y=4 at t=1, safe.\n\nIf go S to y=5 at t=1, unsafe.\n\nSo only possible action at t=0 is D, to y=4 at t=1.\n\nThen at t=1, y=4, which is safe.\n\nNow from y=4 at t=1, we can choose action for t=1 to go to t=2.\n\nAt t=2, safe y: 0,1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9; only y=5 unsafe.\n\nSo from y=4, possible:\n\n- U to y=5, but y=5 at t=2 unsafe.\n\n- D to y=3, y=3 at t=2 safe.\n\n- S to y=4, y=4 at t=2 safe.\n\nNow, we want to go to y=9, so U might be desired, but y=5 unsafe at t=2, so cannot go to y=5.\n\nSo options: D to y=3 or S to y=4.\n\nIf S to y=4, at t=2 y=4.\n\nThen from there, we need to reach y=9.\n\nBut let's see if we can go up later.\n\nIf D to y=3 at t=2.\n\ny=3 at t=2 is safe.\n\nNow at t=2, y=3 or y=4, both safe.\n\nNow t=3: at t=3, safe y: 0,1,2,5,6,7,8,9; y=3 and 4 unsafe.\n\nSo if at t=2 we are at y=3, then at t=3, y=3 is unsafe, so we cannot stay at y=3 or go to y=4? We need to be at a safe y at t=3.\n\nFrom y=3 at t=2, actions:\n\n- U to y=4, but y=4 at t=3 unsafe\n\n- D to y=2, y=2 at t=3 safe\n\n- S to y=3, unsafe\n\nSo only possible D to y=2 at t=3.\n\nSimilarly, if at t=2 we are at y=4, then at t=3, y=4 unsafe, so:\n\n- U to y=5, y=5 at t=3 safe? Yes, y=5 safe at t=3.\n\n- D to y=3, unsafe\n\n- S to y=4, unsafe\n\nSo only possible U to y=5 at t=3.\n\nNow, let's trace.\n\nFirst case: at t=0, we did D to y=4 at t=1.\n\nThen at t=1, we have choices.\n\nOption A: at t=1, S to y=4 at t=2.\n\nThen at t=2, y=4, must go U to y=5 at t=3 (since other options unsafe).\n\nThen at t=3, y=5, safe.\n\nNow from y=5 at t=3, we can go to t=4.\n\nAt t=4, all y safe, as earlier.\n\nWe can go U to y=6, or whatever.\n\nBut we need to go to y=9.\n\ny=5 to y=9, need 4 steps, but at t=3, y=5.\n\nt=3: position y=5\n\nt=4: after action, y could be 4,5,6.\n\nBut we want to reach y=9 soon.\n\nSince all safe from t=4 on, we can go up directly.\n\nFrom t=3, y=5:\n\n- U to y=6 at t=4\n\n- then U to y=7 at t=5\n\n- U to y=8 at t=6\n\n- U to y=9 at t=7\n\nSo at t=7, y=9.\n\nNow, actions: at t=3 (time 3), a_t = U to y=6 at t=4? Let's list times.\n\nTime t: position y_t, then action a_t to y_{t+1}\n\nt=0: y=5, a_0 = D (to y=4)\n\nt=1: y=4, a_1 = S (to y=4) in this option? Earlier I said at t=1, S to y=4 at t=2.\n\nIn option A: at t=1, y=4, we choose S, so a_1 = S, then y_2 =4 at t=2.\n\nThen at t=2, y=4, we must go U, a_2 = U, to y_3=5 at t=3.\n\nThen at t=3, y=5, a_3 = U, to y_4=6 at t=4\n\nt=4: y=6, a_4 = U, to y_5=7 at t=5\n\nt=5: y=7, a_5 = U, to y_6=8 at t=6\n\nt=6: y=8, a_6 = U, to y_7=9 at t=7\n\nSo at t=7, y=7? y_7=9.\n\nt=7, position 9.\n\nWe reached at t=7.\n\nBut min possible is 4, but due to obstacles, we had to go down first.\n\nIn this path, we used 7 turns.\n\nBut we might do better.\n\nEarlier at t=1, from y=4, we could go D to y=3 instead of S.\n\nOption B: at t=0, a_0 = D, to y=4 at t=1\n\nThen at t=1, y=4, instead of S, we do D to y=3 at t=2? a_1 = D, to y_2=3\n\nThen at t=2, y=3, as before, must do D to y=2, a_2 = D, to y_3=2 at t=3\n\nThen at t=3, y=2, which is safe (since y=2 safe at t=3)\n\nNow from y=2 at t=3, we can go U to y=3 at t=4, but t=4 all safe, so to y=3\n\nThen to y=4,5,6,7,8,9, but that would take more time, to t=9 or something, worse than previous.\n\nFrom y=2 at t=3, we can go directly to higher if possible, but we need to move step by step.\n\ny=2 to y=9, min 7 steps from there, but we are at t=3, so t=10 to reach, worse.\n\nSo option B is worse.\n\nBack to option A, we reach at t=7.\n\nBut can we reach faster?\n\nAt t=0, we had to go down to y=4.\n\nIs there another way?\n\nAt t=0, only possible action is D to y=4, since U to y=6 unsafe at t=1, S to y=5 unsafe at t=1.\n\nSo must go to y=4 at t=1.\n\nThen at t=1, y=4, we can choose to go to y=3, y=4, or if we go U? U to y=5, but y=5 at t=2 unsafe? At t=2, y=5 unsafe, so cannot go to y=5 at t=2.\n\nFrom y=4 at t=1:\n\n- U to y=5 at t=2: but y=5 at t=2 unsafe, collision, not allowed.\n\n- D to y=3 at t=2: safe\n\n- S to y=4 at t=2: safe\n\nSo only D or S, not U.\n\nThen as before.\n\nBut in option A, we go to y=4 at t=2, then to y=5 at t=3, which is safe.\n\nt=3 y=5 safe.\n\nThen we can go up.\n\nBut from t=3 y=5, we go to t=4 y=6, etc., to t=7 y=9.\n\nBut at t=4, we are at y=6, but we could go directly to y=9 faster? No, step by step.\n\nSince at t=4, all safe, we can go up as fast as possible.\n\nBut from y=5 at t=3 to y=9, it takes 4 steps: to t=4 y=6, t=5 y=7, t=6 y=8, t=7 y=9.\n\nCan we reach earlier?\n\nt=3 y=5, but if we could be at higher y at t=3.\n\nBut at t=2, we were at y=4 or y=3, not higher.\n\nAt t=1, we are at y=4, which is low.\n\nBut we couldn't go up at t=1 because y=5 at t=2 unsafe.\n\nPerhaps go to y=8 or 9 directly, but from y=4, to y=8, need 4 steps, but at t=1 y=4, to y=8 at t=5, but at t=5 all safe, so possible, but then to y=9 at t=6? Let's see.\n\nIn previous path, we reach at t=7.\n\nIf we go faster: from t=1 y=4, instead of staying, we go up, but we cannot because y=5 at t=2 unsafe.\n\nUnless we go to another y.\n\nBut at t=1, from y=4, we can only go to y=3,4 (since D or S), not to y=5.\n\ny=3 at t=2 is safe, but then we have to go down to y=2 at t=3, which is farther.\n\nNot better.\n\nPerhaps at t=0, is there a way to go to y=1 or something.\n\nBut at t=0, y=5, if we go D to y=4, that's the only choice.\n\nUnless we go to y=6, but unsafe.\n\nOr stay, unsafe.\n\nSo must go down.\n\nThen at t=1 y=4, we can go S to y=4 at t=2, then U to y=5 at t=3.\n\nThen from y=5 at t=3, we need to go to y=9.\n\nBut y=5 to y=9, 4 steps, to t=7.\n\nSince at t=4 all safe, we could go from y=5 to y=6 at t=4, etc.\n\nBut can we be at y=9 earlier? t=4 would be min, but at t=0 y=5, t=1 y=4 (lower), t=2 y=4, t=3 y=5, all not high, so t=4 at best y=6, t=5 y=7, t=6 y=8, t=7 y=9.\n\nUnless we can jump, but no.\n\nPerhaps at t=1, go to y=3, but worse.\n\nAnother idea: go to y=8 or y=9 directly if possible.\n\nBut at t=1, we are at y=4, and y=8 at t=1 is safe, but to reach y=8 from y=4 at t=1, we need to be at y=8 at some later time.\n\nFor example, at t=1 y=4, go U, but cannot to y=5 at t=2 unsafe.\n\nGo D to y=3 at t=2, then from there, at t=2 y=3, can go U to y=4? But at t=3 y=4 unsafe, so cannot.\n\nMust go D to y=2 at t=3.\n\nThen at t=3 y=2, safe, then go U to y=3 at t=4, then to y=4 at t=5, etc., much slower.\n\nSo the fastest is to stay at y=4 until t=3? No.\n\nIn the first path: t=0 y=5 D to y=4\n\nt=1 y=4 S to y=4 (a_1=S)\n\nt=2 y=4 U to y=5 (a_2=U)\n\nt=3 y=5 U to y=6 (a_3=U)\n\nt=4 y=6 U to y=7 (a_4=U)\n\nt=5 y=7 U to y=8 (a_5=U)\n\nt=6 y=8 U to y=9 (a_6=U)\n\nThen at t=6, y=9? t=6 position y=9.\n\nt=0: y=5\n\nt=1: y=4\n\nt=2: y=4? No:\n\nAfter actions:\n\nTime t: position y_t, then action a_t, then y_{t+1}\n\nt=0: y_0=5, a_0=D, so y_1=4\n\nt=1: y_1=4, a_1=S, so y_2=4\n\nt=2: y_2=4, a_2=U, so y_3=5\n\nt=3: y_3=5, a_3=U, so y_4=6\n\nt=4: y_4=6, a_4=U, so y_5=7\n\nt=5: y_5=7, a_5=U, so y_6=8\n\nt=6: y_6=8, a_6=U, so y_7=9\n\nSo at time t=7, y_7=9.\n\nWe are at position at time t=7.\n\nBut y_t=9 at t=7.\n\nThe sequence has actions from a_0 to a_6, 7 actions, to reach at t=7.\n\nMinimal H: since we start at t=0, reach at t=7, so T=7.\n\nBut we can reach earlier?\n\nAt t=1, y=4, instead of S, we could go U to y=5, but y=5 at t=2 unsafe, not possible.\n\nGo to y=3, but worse.\n\nPerhaps from y=4 at t=1, go to y=4 at t=2, then at t=2, instead of U to y=5, we could go directly to higher, but no, must go step by step.\n\nAt t=2, y=4, we can go U to y=5, but only if safe at t=3 for y=5, which it is, but we do it.\n\ny=5 at t=3 safe.\n\nBut we could go to y=6 from y=4? No, only to y=3,4,5.\n\nFrom y=4, actions: U to y=5, D to y=3, S to y=4.\n\nCannot go directly to y=6.\n\nSo no.\n\nPerhaps at some point go down to avoid, but in this case, we don't need.\n\nAnother thing: at t=3, y=5, we go up, but we could go to y=8 or 9 faster if possible, but no.\n\nSince y=8 and y=9 are always safe, but we need to reach there.\n\nBut from y=5, it takes time.\n\nUnless we can be at y=9 at t=4, but impossible since from t=0 y=5, max y=9 at t=4, but at t=1 we are at y=4, lower, so at t=2 max y=5 or 6? From y=4 at t=1, to y=5 at t=2 but unsafe, so we are at y=4 at t=2, then to y=5 at t=3, so at t=3 y=5, t=4 y=6, etc., cannot be higher.\n\nSo t=7 seems minimal.\n\nBut let's confirm if there is another path.\n\nWhat if at t=0 we go down to y=4.\n\nAt t=1 y=4, we go down to y=3.\n\nThen t=2 y=3, must go down to y=2 at t=3.\n\nt=3 y=2, safe.\n\nThen from there, at t=4, all safe, we can go up: to y=3 at t=4, y=4 at t=5, y=5 at t=6, y=6 at t=7, y=7 at t=8, y=8 at t=9, y=9 at t=10. Worse.\n\nSo not better.\n\nGo to y=1 or something, but lower, worse.\n\nSo the first path seems best.\n\nIn the first path, at t=2, we are at y=4, and we go U to y=5 at t=3.\n\nBut at t=2, y=4 is safe, and we could go to other y, but why? We need to go up.\n\nFor example, go to y=6 from y=4? No.\n\nOr stay, but then at t=3 y=4 unsafe, so must go U to y=5 at t=3.\n\nNo choice.\n\nSo path is fixed: must go down at first, then stay, then up step by step.\n\nNow, we reach at t=7.\n\nBut in the sequence, actions: a_0 = D, a_1 = S, a_2 = U, a_3 = U, a_4 = U, a_5 = U, a_6 = U.\n\na_2 = U to y=5 at t=3.\n\nThen a_3=U to y=6 at t=4, etc.\n\nIn terms of the output, we need to list the actions for turns starting from t_1.\n\nt_1 =7.\n\nSo actions from turn t_1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nHere H=7, since we have 7 actions to reach at t=7.\n\ny_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{7 + 7 -1} = y_{13} =9? Let's see.\n\nAbsolute turn.\n\nStart at turn T = t_1 =7, position y=5.\n\nApply action a_{t_1} = a_7, then to y at turn 8.\n\nTurn sequence:\n\nLet T be absolute turn.\n\nAt turn T: position y_T, apply a_T, then to y_{T+1}.\n\nStart: at turn 7, y_7 =5.\n\nWe apply a_7, a_8, ..., up to a_{7+H-1}, and y_{7+H-1} =9.\n\nIn the sequence, we have actions from a_7 to a_{7+H-1}, and y_{7+H-1}=9.\n\nIn relative, we reached at t=7, which is absolute turn 7+7=14? Set relative t.\n\nSet relative time: at relative time 0, absolute turn t_1=7, y=5.\n\nAfter k actions, at relative time k, absolute turn t_1 + k, position y_k.\n\nWe want for some K, y_K =9.\n\nK=7 in our case.\n\nThen actions are a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to K-1? t from 0 to K-1, actions at relative time t, which is absolute turn t_1 + t.\n\nAfter K actions, we have position at relative time K, which is absolute turn t_1 + K.\n\nBut we want y at absolute turn t_1 + K to be 9? No.\n\nIn the position: at relative time 0, absolute turn t_1, position y=5.\n\nAfter action a_{t_1 + 0} at absolute turn t_1, we go to position at absolute turn t_1 +1.\n\nSimilarly, after action at absolute turn T, position at turn T+1.\n\nWe want position at some absolute turn to be 9.\n\nSpecifically, y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nSet S = t_1 + H -1, so at turn S, y_S=9.\n\nThen H-1 is the number of actions to reach from turn t_1 to turn S.\n\nFrom turn t_1 to turn S, there are S - t_1 actions? From turn t_1 to turn S, the positions are from y_{t_1} to y_S, and actions from a_{t_1} to a_{S-1}.\n\nNumber of actions: from a_{t_1} to a_{S-1}, that is S - t_1 actions.\n\nThen y_S =9.\n\nIn the problem, H is the minimal number such that y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nSo let T = t_1 + H -1, then y_T=9, and H-1 = T - t_1, so H = (T - t_1) +1.\n\nIn our case, relative, we reach at relative time 7, so absolute turn t_1 + 7.\n\nSet T_abs = turn when y=9.\n\nT_abs = t_1 + K, with K=7.\n\nThen y_{T_abs} =9.\n\nThen y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, so t_1 + H -1 = t_1 + K, so H-1 = K, H = K+1.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t=0 to H-1, which is to K.\n\nIn our case, K=7, so H=8? I think I confused.\n\nLet's clarify.\n\nDefine: we start at turn t_1, position y_{t_1}.\n\nApply action a_{t_1}, to position at turn t_1 +1.\n\nApply a_{t_1+1}, to position at turn t_1+2.\n\n...\n\nApply a_{t_1 + M}, to position at turn t_1 + M +1.\n\nWe want position at some turn to be 9, say at turn T, y_T=9.\n\nThen the actions are from a_{t_1} to a_{T-1}, if T > t_1.\n\nNumber of actions: T - t_1.\n\nThen y_T=9.\n\nThe problem says: minimal H such that y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nSo let U = t_1 + H -1, then y_U=9.\n\nThen the actions are from a_{t_1} to a_{U-1}, since to go from y_{t_1} to y_U, actions a_{t_1} to a_{U-1}, number of actions: U - t_1.\n\nBut U = t_1 + H -1, so U - t_1 = H -1.\n\nNumber of actions is H-1.\n\nIn the sequence {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1}, that is H actions.\n\nBut to reach y_U at turn U, with U = t_1 + H -1, we need actions from a_{t_1} to a_{U-1}, which is from t=0 to (U-1 - t_1) = ( (t_1 + H -1) - t_1 ) -1? Messy.\n\nSet U = t_1 + H -1, y_U=9.\n\nThen the actions needed are a_{t_1}, a_{t_1+1}, ..., a_{U-1}, which is H-1 actions.\n\nBut the sequence given is for t=0 to H-1, which would be a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1}.\n\nBut a_{t_1 + H -1} is applied at turn t_1 + H -1, which is turn U, to go to y_{U+1}, but we don't care, since we reached at U.\n\nIn the output, we list actions from a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1}, but for reaching y_U=9 at turn U, we only need actions up to a_{U-1}, so a_{t_1 + H -1} is extra if H-1 actions are needed.\n\nI think there is inconsistency.\n\nFrom the problem: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and \"y_{t_1 + H -1} =9\"\n\ny_{t_1 + H -1} =9 means at turn t_1 + H -1, position is 9.\n\nThen, to achieve that, we apply actions from turn t_1 to turn t_1 + H - 2? Let's think.\n\nAt turn t_1, position y_{t_1}, apply a_{t_1}, to y_{t_1 +1}\n\n...\n\nAt turn t_1 + K, position y_{t_1 + K}, apply a_{t_1 + K}, to y_{t_1 + K +1}\n\nWe want y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nSo the position at turn t_1 + H -1 is 9.\n\nThis position is before applying action at that turn.\n\nAfter applying action at turn t_1 + H -1, we go to y_{t_1 + H}, but we don't care.\n\nTo have y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, we need to have arrived there by actions from turn t_1 to turn t_1 + H - 2.\n\nThe actions a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H - 2} determine y_{t_1 + H -1}.\n\nFor example, with one action: H=1, then y_{t_1 + 1 -1} = y_{t_1} =9, so if start at 9, no action needed, but H=1, sequence for t=0 to 0, one action? But if already at 9, we might need no action, but H min.\n\nIn this case, start at y=5≠9, so H>1.\n\nIn general, to reach at turn U = t_1 + H -1, we need actions from a_{t_1} to a_{U-1} = a_{t_1 + H -2}\n\nNumber of actions: (U-1) - t_1 +1 = U - t_1 = (t_1 + H -1) - t_1 = H-1\n\nBut the sequence has H actions, from t=0 to H-1, so a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1}\n\nBut a_{t_1 + H -1} is applied at turn t_1 + H -1, to go to y_{t_1 + H}, which is after we have reached.\n\nSo for the reaching point, we don't need the action at that turn.\n\nBut in the output, we list it, but since we are at y=9, we can choose any action, but it doesn't affect reaching.\n\nIn this case, since we reach at turn U, y_U=9, we apply a_U to go to y_{U+1}, but since we care only about reaching, we can set a_U to S or something.\n\nIn the sequence, it includes a_{t_1 + H -1}, which is applied when we are at 9.\n\nIn our path, we reach at absolute turn t_1 + 7, since relative t=7.\n\nt_1=7, so at absolute turn 14, y=9.\n\nSet U = t_1 + H -1 =7 + H -1 =6 + H\n\nWe want U=14, so 6 + H =14, H=8.\n\ny_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{7 + H -1} = y_{6 + H}\n\nSet equal to 9.\n\nIn relative, y_K=9 at K=7, absolute turn t_1 + K =7+7=14.\n\nSo y_{14} =9.\n\nThen y_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{7 + H -1} =9, so 7 + H -1 =14, thus H-1=7, H=8.\n\nThen the sequence is actions from a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to 7 (since H-1=7, t=0 to 7? t from 0 to H-1, H=8, so t=0 to 7, 8 actions.\n\nBut in the path, we have actions from relative t=0 to t=6, 7 actions, to reach at t=7.\n\nActions: a_0 to a_6, 7 actions, applied at absolute turn 7 to 13, to reach position at turn 14.\n\nAt turn 14, position y=9.\n\nNow, y_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{7 + H -1} = y_{6 + H} =9, so 6+H=14, H=8.\n\nThen actions from t=0 to 7: a_{t_1} to a_{t_1+7}\n\nBut a_{t_1+7} is applied at turn t_1+7=14, to go to y_{15}, but we don't care.\n\nSince we are at y=9 at turn 14, we can apply S or whatever.\n\nIn the sequence, for t=0 to 6, we have the actions to reach, and for t=7, we can add an action, but since we reached, it might be extra.\n\nBut to match the format, we need to output H actions.\n\nIn this case, with H=8, we have 8 actions, but only 7 are needed to reach at turn 14.\n\nThe 8th action is after reaching.\n\nBut the position is reached at turn t_1 + H -1 =7+8-1=14, y=9.\n\nNow, the actions include a_{t_1 +7} at turn 14, which we can set to S, for example.\n\nSimilarly, in the sequence up to a_{t_1+6} for turns 13, to go to y_{14}=9.\n\nThen a_{t_1+7} at turn 14 to stay or move, but since at y=9, moving up does nothing.\n\nFor minimal H, we have to include that.\n\nIn our case, to reach at turn 14, we need actions from a_7 to a_{13}, 7 actions.\n\nThen for H=8, we output actions from a_7 to a_{14}, but a_{14} is extra.\n\nBut let's list.\n\nAbsolute turn: start turn 7, y=5.\n\nApply a_7: D, to y=4 at turn 8\n\nTurn 8: y=4, apply a_8: S, to y=4 at turn 9\n\nTurn 9: y=4, apply a_9: U, to y=5 at turn 10\n\nTurn 10: y=5, apply a_10: U, to y=6 at turn 11\n\nTurn 11: y=6, apply a_11: U, to y=7 at turn 12\n\nTurn 12: y=7, apply a_12: U, to y=8 at turn 13\n\nTurn 13: y=8, apply a_13: U, to y=9 at turn 14\n\nNow at turn 14, y=9, we reached.\n\ny_{14} =9.\n\nNow y_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{7 + H -1} =9, so 7+H-1=14, H-1=7, H=8.\n\nThen the sequence is actions for turns t_1 to t_1 + H -1 =7 to 7+7=14? t_1 + H -1 =7+8-1=14, so actions from a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1} = a_7 to a_{14}.\n\nBut a_{14} is at turn 14, when we are at y=9, so we apply a_{14} to go to y_{15}.\n\nSince we don't care, we can set a_{14} to S.\n\nSimilarly, in the output, we list actions for turn 7 to turn 14.\n\nBut for turn 14, since we are at 9, action S is fine.\n\nNow, in terms of the minimal H, we reached at turn 14 with 7 actions from turn 7 to 13.\n\nBut with H=8, we include an extra action.\n\nBut H is the number of turns, but the sequence has H actions.\n\nPerhaps for this case, since we reach at turn 14, and H=8, it includes the action at the reaching turn.\n\nBut in the collision, at the reaching turn, we are at y=9, safe, so no issue.\n\nTo confirm, is there a way to reach earlier?\n\nFor example, at turn 10, can we be at y=9?\n\nAt turn 7, y=5\n\nTurn 8: after action, y<=6\n\nTurn 9: y<=7\n\nTurn 10: y<=8, cannot be 9 at turn 10.\n\nSimilarly, turn 11: y<=9, but at turn 11, from above, to be at y=9 at turn 11, we need to be at y=8 at turn 10, etc.\n\nBut at turn 8, we are at y=4, so turn 9 max y=5, turn 10 max y=6, turn 11 max y=7, turn 12 max y=8, turn 13 max y=9.\n\nSo at turn 13, we can be at y=9.\n\nHow?\n\nStart turn 7, y=5, a_7=D, to y=4 turn 8\n\nThen at turn 8, y=4, instead of S, we go U, but to y=5 at turn 9, but at turn 9, y=5: is it safe?\n\nTurn 9 absolute, but in relative, turn 9 absolute is t_1 +2? t_1=7, absolute turn 9 is relative t=2.\n\nAt relative t=2, which is absolute turn 9? Absolute turn: t_1=7, so absolute turn T, relative tau = T - t_1.\n\nAt absolute turn 8, relative t=1, y=4\n\nAbsolute turn 9, relative t=2, position y?\n\nIf at abs turn 8, y=4, apply action, to y at turn 9.\n\nIf apply U, to y=5 at turn 9.\n\nNow at turn 9, relative t=2, y=5.\n\nIs y=5 safe at t=2? Relative t=2.\n\nFrom earlier, freeway 5 unsafe at relative t=1 and 2.\n\nRelative t=2 is time from start, so at relative t=2, freeway 5 unsafe.\n\nThus at absolute turn 9, if y=5, and relative t=2, unsafe, collision.\n\nCannot go to y=5 at relative t=2.\n\nTherefore, cannot be at higher y earlier.\n\nThus, the earliest to reach y=9 is at absolute turn 14.\n\nWith H=8.\n\nActions: for turn 7: D\n\nTurn 8: S (or in the path, at turn 8 y=4, we applied S to stay at y=4 for turn 9)\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nTurn 7: a_7 = D\n\nThen turn 8: position y=4, a_8 = S\n\nTurn 9: y=4, a_9 = U\n\nTurn 10: y=5, a_10 = U\n\nTurn 11: y=6, a_11 = U\n\nTurn 12: y=7, a_12 = U\n\nTurn 13: y=8, a_13 = U\n\nNow at turn 13, after a_13=U, to y=9 at turn 14.\n\nSo at turn 14, y=9.\n\nNow for the sequence to include a_{14}, we need to specify.\n\nSince we reached at turn 14, and we need y_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{14} =9, so t_1 + H -1 =14, 7 + H -1=14, H=8.\n\nThen actions from turn 7 to turn 14: a_7 to a_{14}\n\na_7 to a_{13} as above, and a_{14} can be S, since at y=9.\n\nIn the output, we list:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} = a_7\n\nTurn t_1 +1: a_{8}\n\n...\n\nUp to turn t_1 + H -1 = turn 14.\n\nH=8, t_1 + H -1 =7+7=14? t_1 + H -1 =7 +8 -1=14.\n\nYes.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 7: D\n\nTurn 8: S\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: ? we need to specify, but at turn 14, we are at y=9, and we apply action, to go to y_{15}, but since the goal is to reach (0,9), we can set a_{14} to S.\n\nSimilarly, in the sequence.\n\nBut to minimize H, H=8 is used.\n\nIs there a way with smaller H?\n\nSuppose H=7, then y_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{7+7-1} = y_{13} =9.\n\nBut can we be at y=9 at turn 13?\n\nFrom above, at turn 13, we are at y=8, going to y=9 at turn 14.\n\nCan we be at y=9 earlier?\n\nAt turn 13, y=9, so at turn 12, we need to be at y=8 or 9.\n\nBut at turn 12, from where?\n\nStart turn 7 y=5.\n\nAfter 5 actions, at turn 12 position.\n\nActions from turn 7 to 11 determine y_{12}.\n\ny_{12} could be up to 9, but with obstacles.\n\nAt turn 7, y=5, must go D to y=4 turn 8.\n\nTurn 8 y=4, must go S or D, to y=4 or 3 at turn 9.\n\nIf to y=4 turn 9, then at turn 9 y=4, can go U to y=5 turn 10.\n\nBut at turn 10, relative t=3, y=5 safe.\n\nThen from turn 10 y=5, go U to y=6 turn 11.\n\nTurn 11 y=6, go U to y=7 turn 12.\n\nTurn 12 y=7, then to y=8 turn 13.\n\nCannot be at y=9 at turn 13.\n\nIf at turn 8, go D to y=3 turn 9.\n\nThen turn 9 y=3, must go D to y=2 turn 10 (since at turn 10, relative t=3, y=3 unsafe, so must go D to y=2)\n\nTurn 10 y=2, then go U to y=3 turn 11, etc., slower.\n\nSo impossible to reach y=9 before turn 14.\n\nThus minimal H=8.\n\nNow for the action at turn 14, we set to S.\n\nIn the output, the sequence should be for turns 7 to 14.\n\nBut let's list the actions:\n\nFor turn 7: a_{t_1} = a_7 = D\n\nTurn 8: a_8 = S\n\nTurn 9: a_9 = U\n\nTurn 10: a_10 = U\n\nTurn 11: a_11 = U\n\nTurn 12: a_12 = U\n\nTurn 13: a_13 = U\n\nTurn 14: a_14 = S  (since at y=9, stay)\n\nIn the sequence, a_10 to a_13 are all U, from y=5 to 6,7,8,9? a_10 at turn 10, from y=5 to y=6, etc.\n\nIn terms of the answer format.\n\nWe need to output the actions.\n\nIn the car state, freeway 2 has cars that are unsafe at t=9,10,11 relative, but since we are done by t=7 relative, no issue.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nSo I think this is the minimal.\n\nPerhaps we can go directly to y=8 or something, but not possible.\n\nAnother thing: at t=1 relative, y=4, we could go to y=3, but then to go up, it takes time to go through y=2, etc., worse.\n\nSo yes.\n\nThus, the sequence.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 5) at turn \\(t_1 = 7\\). The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis of Car Movements and Safe Freeways\nThe safety of each freeway at each relative time \\(t\\) (from the starting turn \\(t_1 = 7\\)) is determined based on car positions and their movement. A freeway \\(y\\) is unsafe at time \\(t\\) if any car on that freeway covers position \\(x = 0\\) at that time. The safety per freeway over time is:\n\n- **Freeway 1**: Always safe.\n- **Freeway 2**: Unsafe at \\(t = 0, 1, 9, 10, 11\\); safe otherwise.\n- **Freeway 3**: Unsafe at \\(t = 3\\); safe otherwise.\n- **Freeway 4**: Unsafe at \\(t = 3\\); safe otherwise.\n- **Freeway 5**: Unsafe at \\(t = 1, 2\\); safe otherwise.\n- **Freeway 6**: Unsafe at \\(t = 1\\); safe otherwise.\n- **Freeway 7**: Unsafe at \\(t = 1\\); safe otherwise.\n- **Freeway 8**: Always safe.\n- **y = 0 and y = 9**: Always safe (no cars).\n\n### Path to Reach (0, 9) Minimally\nThe player must move from \\(y = 5\\) at \\(t = 0\\) (absolute turn 7) to \\(y = 9\\) as quickly as possible, avoiding unsafe positions at each turn. The minimal path is achieved as follows:\n\n- At \\(t = 0\\) (turn 7), \\(y = 5\\) is safe. Moving up to \\(y = 6\\) or staying at \\(y = 5\\) leads to unsafe positions at \\(t = 1\\). Thus, the only safe action is down to \\(y = 4\\).\n- At \\(t = 1\\) (turn 8), \\(y = 4\\) is safe. Moving up to \\(y = 5\\) is unsafe at \\(t = 2\\), so staying at \\(y = 4\\) is chosen to prepare for an upward move later.\n- At \\(t = 2\\) (turn 9), \\(y = 4\\) is safe. Moving up to \\(y = 5\\) is safe at \\(t = 3\\), so up is chosen.\n- At \\(t = 3\\) (turn 10), \\(y = 5\\) is safe. From here, all freeways are safe for \\(t \\geq 4\\), so moving up directly to \\(y = 9\\) is possible.\n  - Move up to \\(y = 6\\) at \\(t = 4\\) (turn 11).\n  - Move up to \\(y = 7\\) at \\(t = 5\\) (turn 12).\n  - Move up to \\(y = 8\\) at \\(t = 6\\) (turn 13).\n  - Move up to \\(y = 9\\) at \\(t = 7\\) (turn 14).\n- At \\(t = 7\\) (turn 14), \\(y = 9\\) is reached. An action must still be specified for this turn; staying (S) is chosen since the position is already at the goal.\n\nThis path reaches \\(y = 9\\) at absolute turn 14, which is \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 7 + H - 1\\). Solving \\(7 + H - 1 = 14\\) gives \\(H = 8\\). The sequence of actions from turn 7 to turn 14 achieves the goal in 8 turns.\n\n### Action Sequence\nThe actions are:\n- Turn 7: D (down to \\(y = 4\\))\n- Turn 8: S (stay at \\(y = 4\\))\n- Turn 9: U (up to \\(y = 5\\))\n- Turn 10: U (up to \\(y = 6\\))\n- Turn 11: U (up to \\(y = 7\\))\n- Turn 12: U (up to \\(y = 8\\))\n- Turn 13: U (up to \\(y = 9\\))\n- Turn 14: S (stay at \\(y = 9\\), goal reached)\n\nThis sequence ensures no collisions and reaches (0, 9) in the minimal \\(H = 8\\) turns.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 7: \\text{D} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: \\text{S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: \\text{U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: \\text{U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: \\text{U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: \\text{U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: \\text{U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 14: \\text{S} \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at position (0, 4) on turn t_1 = 8. The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing the y-position by +1, -1, or 0 respectively, but y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCollision occurs only if at some turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there is a car such that 0 (the x-position) is in the car's span at that turn T.\n\nThe key point is that when you move, you are not on the new freeway until the next turn. Specifically, if you move to y_{T+1} at turn T, you are not considered on y_{T+1} until turn T+1. So, at turn T, you are still on y_T, and you only check for collisions on y_T at that turn.\n\nThe collision condition is: at turn T, for the freeway y_T, if there is a car where 0 is in its span at time T.\n\nThe span updates based on the car's direction and speed. For left-moving cars, the span shifts left (decreasing x), for right-moving, it shifts right (increasing x).\n\nI need to find the minimal H and a sequence of actions from turn 8 to turn 8+H-1 such that y_{8+H-1} = 9.\n\nStart at y=4 on turn 8.\n\nI need to get to y=9. Since moving up increases y, I probably want to move up as much as possible, but I have to avoid the cars on freeways 1 to 8.\n\nFreeway y=1 to y=8 are the ones with cars; y=0 and y=9 are safe, I assume, since no cars are mentioned there. y=9 is the goal, so no cars there, and y=0 might be the start or something, but we're at (0,4), so y=4 has cars? No, the freeways are the rows; the player is on a specific row at each turn.\n\nThe player position is (x,y), but x is always 0, I think, since we're moving vertically? The player moves vertically between rows y=0 to y=9, and horizontally, x is fixed at 0? From the player update, only y changes, x is not mentioned, so I think the player is always at x=0, and we move up and down in y.\n\nCars are on the freeways, which are horizontal lanes at each y-level from 1 to 8, and they move left or right, so their spans are horizontal positions.\n\nCollision when player is at (0,y) and for that y, at that turn, 0 is within some car's span on that freeway.\n\nNow, the car states are given for turn t_1=8.\n\nI need to model where the cars are at future turns.\n\nFirst, let's list all cars for each freeway.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: head -48, tail -95, direction right, speed 48. Since direction is right, and head and tail: it says (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s).\n\nFor right-moving, span is [τ, h] and it moves right, so at time T, span is [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, [h, τ] moves to [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nIn this case, freeway 1: one car, h=-48, τ=-95, d=right, s=48.\n\nSince d=right, and for right-moving, span is from τ to h, but τ=-95, h=-48, so τ < h since -95 < -48, so span is from -95 to -48 at t_1=8.\n\nThen at time T, position: since moving right, span is [τ + s(T-8), h + s(T-8)] = [-95 + 48(T-8), -48 + 48(T-8)]\n\nNow, collision if 0 is in this interval for some T when player is on freeway 1.\n\nBut freeway 1 is y=1, player might be on it at some turn.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFreeway 2 has three cars: (-32,-43,right,4), (44,33,right,4), (8,-3,right,4)\n\nLet's parse: (head, tail, dir, speed)\n\nFor right-moving, span should be [tail, head] if tail < head.\n\nFirst car: h=-32, τ=-43, d=right, s=4. Since τ=-43, h=-32, τ < h, so span [ -43, -32 ] at t_1=8? No.\n\nThe notation says: for right-moving, span is [τ, h], but in the car update, for right-moving, span at t_1 is [τ, h], and it moves to [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT]\n\nIn the description: \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\" for right-moving.\n\nBut for the car on freeway 2, first one: (h,τ) = (-32,-43), d=right.\n\nτ = -43, h = -32, so τ < h, so [τ, h] = [-43, -32] at t_1.\n\nSimilarly, second car: (44,33,right,4), h=44, τ=33, so [33,44] at t_1.\n\nThird car: (8,-3,right,4), h=8, τ=-3, so [-3,8] at t_1.\n\nh=8, τ=-3, so τ to h is from -3 to 8, which includes 0? -3 to 8, yes, 0 is between -3 and 8.\n\nAt t_1=8, for freeway 2, the third car has span [-3,8], so 0 is in it, so if player is on y=2 at turn 8, collision? But player starts at y=4, not on y=2 at turn 8.\n\nBut for future turns, we need to see when 0 is in span for each freeway at each turn.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways.\n\nFreeway 3: two cars: (24,13,right,12) and (-24,-35,right,12)\n\nFirst car: h=24, τ=13, so [13,24] at t_1\n\nSecond car: h=-24, τ=-35, so [-35,-24] at t_1\n\nFreeway 4: same as freeway 3? (24,13,right,12) and (-24,-35,right,12), identical to freeway 3.\n\nFreeway 5: (0,-11,right,6) and (48,37,right,6)\n\nFirst car: h=0, τ=-11, so [-11,0] at t_1, which includes 0? τ=-11, h=0, so span [-11,0], so at t_1, 0 is the head, so 0 is included, I think. Since it's a closed interval probably, so if 0 is endpoint, it is included.\n\nSimilarly, second car: h=48, τ=37, [37,48]\n\nFreeway 6: (0,23,left,24)\n\nDirection left, so for left-moving, span at t_1 is [h, τ] = [0,23]? h=0, τ=23, and direction left.\n\nIn the update, for left-moving, span(t_1) = [h, τ] → [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT]\n\nAnd since left-moving, h should be the head, which is left, so if moving left, head should be larger x or smaller? Typically, left means decreasing x, so head has higher x if it's the front.\n\nIn the description: \"Left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s (T-t_1), τ - s (T-t_1)]\"\n\nAnd it says \"head is at h, tail is at τ\", so for left-moving, h is the head position at t_1, which should be the right end if moving left? I need to clarify.\n\nAssume x-axis: left is negative, right is positive, or absolute positions.\n\nIn the car on freeway 6: (0,23,left,24), h=0, τ=23, d=left.\n\nIf moving left, and h=0, τ=23, but 0 and 23, if moving left, from where? h=0, τ=23, so if moving left, the head is at 0, tail at 23? But tail should be behind, so if moving left, head at smaller x? Let's think.\n\nSuppose at t_1, positions: if h=0 and τ=23, and moving left, then as time increases, both decrease, so at T>t_1, h - sΔT and τ - sΔT.\n\nSince moving left, the head is at the left end, so if h=0 and τ=23, h < τ, so head at 0, tail at 23, which means the car extends from 0 to 23, so if moving left, the head is at smaller x, tail at larger x, but when moving left, the front is decreasing, so head should have smaller x than tail? I'm confused.\n\nLet's look back at the update rule.\n\nFor left-moving: \"Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s (T-t_1), τ - s (T-t_1)]\"\n\nAnd it says \"head is at h, tail is at τ\".\n\nIn the example for freeway 6, h=0, τ=23, d=left.\n\nAt t_1, span is [0,23].\n\nIf moving left, at later time, it shifts left, so [0 - sΔT, 23 - sΔT].\n\nFor example, at t_1, if s=24, but we'll calculate.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 7: (0,23,left,24) same as freeway 6.\n\nFreeway 8: (48,83,left,36) h=48, τ=83, d=left, so at t_1, span [48,83], then [48 - 36ΔT, 83 - 36ΔT]\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need to find when 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway for turns T >= t_1.\n\nThat is, for each y from 1 to 8, and for each turn T, whether position x=0 is occupied by a car on that row at that turn.\n\nThen, the player must not be on a freeway y at turn T if 0 is occupied at that turn on y.\n\nSince player is at (0,y_T) at turn T, and collision if 0 in some car span on y_T at T.\n\nTo reach y=9, which has no cars, so once there, it's safe.\n\ny=0 might be safe, but we start at y=4, need to go to y=9, so probably moving up.\n\nMinimal H: since from y=4 to y=9, need to increase y by 5, so at least 5 turns if we move up every turn, but may need to wait or detour to avoid cars.\n\nH is the number of turns, so actions from t=0 to H-1 relative to start, but in terms of turns, from turn 8 to turn 8+H-1, after H actions, we reach y=9.\n\nStart at turn t_1=8, position y=4.\n\nAfter first action at turn 8, we go to y_{9}, but the action a_t is applied at turn t to get y_{t+1}, I think.\n\nPlayer update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, where Δy_t depends on a_t.\n\nSo at turn t, we choose a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nThe state at turn t is y_t.\n\nThen we choose a_t, which sets y_{t+1}.\n\nFor collision, at turn T, we are at position (0, y_T), and we check if for freeway y_T, 0 is in some car span at time T.\n\nThe note says: if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will not be considered on y_{T+1} at turn T, so only check y_T at turn T.\n\nAt turn T, you are on y_T, and you choose a_T to go to y_{T+1}.\n\nThen at turn T, collision depends on y_T and the cars on y_T at time T.\n\nAt turn T+1, you are on y_{T+1}, and check cars on y_{T+1} at time T+1.\n\nSo, to avoid collision, for each turn T when we are on y between 1 and 8, we need that for that y and T, 0 is not in any car span on that freeway.\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need to find the times when 0 is occupied.\n\nLet t_1 = 8, so ΔT = T - 8 for T >=8.\n\nI'll compute for each freeway the set of T where 0 is covered by a car.\n\nFirst, freeway y=1:\n\nOne car: right-moving, span at T: [τ + s(T-8), h + s(T-8)] = [-95 + 48(T-8), -48 + 48(T-8)]\n\nSet 0 in this interval:\n\n-95 + 48(ΔT) <= 0 <= -48 + 48(ΔT)  where ΔT = T-8\n\nSo -95 + 48ΔT <= 0 and 0 <= -48 + 48ΔT\n\nFirst inequality: -95 + 48ΔT <= 0 => 48ΔT <= 95 => ΔT <= 95/48 ≈ 1.979, so ΔT <= 1 since integer? T is turn, so integer, ΔT integer.\n\nΔT = T-8, integer >=0.\n\n48ΔT <= 95, ΔT <= floor(95/48) = 1, since 48*1=48<95, 48*2=96>95.\n\nSimilarly, second inequality: 0 <= -48 + 48ΔT => 48 <= 48ΔT => ΔT >=1\n\nSo ΔT >=1 and ΔT <=1, so only when ΔT=1.\n\nThus for freeway 1, 0 is occupied only at T=8+1=9.\n\nΔT=1, T=9.\n\nNow, freeway y=2:\n\nThree cars.\n\nFirst car: (-32,-43,right,4), span at T: [-43 + 4(ΔT), -32 + 4(ΔT)]\n\n0 in [-43+4ΔT, -32+4ΔT]\n\nSo -43+4ΔT <=0 and 0 <= -32+4ΔT\n\nFirst: -43+4ΔT <=0 => 4ΔT <=43 => ΔT <= 10.75, so ΔT <=10\n\nSecond: 0 <= -32+4ΔT => 32 <=4ΔT => ΔT >=8\n\nSo for ΔT from 8 to 10 inclusive, T=16,17,18? ΔT=T-8, so T=16,17,18? Let's see:\n\nΔT >=8 and <=10, so T=8+8=16 to 8+10=18.\n\nT=16,17,18.\n\nBut at T=16, ΔT=8: span [-43+4*8, -32+4*8] = [-43+32, -32+32] = [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nT=17: [-43+36, -32+36] = [-7,4], 0 in.\n\nT=18: [-43+40, -32+40] = [-3,8], 0 in.\n\nT=19: [-43+44, -32+44] = [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, second car: (44,33,right,4), span [33 +4ΔT, 44+4ΔT]\n\n33+4ΔT >0 for ΔT>=0, and min is 33>0, so 0 not in for any T.\n\nThird car: (8,-3,right,4), h=8, τ=-3, so span [-3 +4ΔT, 8 +4ΔT]\n\n0 in [-3+4ΔT, 8+4ΔT]\n\n-3+4ΔT <=0 always for small ΔT, but:\n\n-3+4ΔT <=0 => 4ΔT <=3 => ΔT <=0.75, so ΔT <=0\n\n0 <= 8+4ΔT always true for ΔT>=0\n\nSo ΔT <=0, so only for ΔT=0, T=8.\n\nAt T=8, span [-3,8], 0 in it.\n\nFor freeway 2, occupied when:\n\n- From third car at T=8\n\n- From first car at T=16,17,18\n\nSecond car never covers 0.\n\nSo freeway 2 occupied at T=8,16,17,18.\n\nNow freeway y=3: two cars, both right, s=12.\n\nFirst car: (24,13,right,12), span [13 +12ΔT, 24+12ΔT]\n\n13+12ΔT >=13>0, so 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: (-24,-35,right,12), span [-35 +12ΔT, -24 +12ΔT]\n\n0 in [-35+12ΔT, -24+12ΔT]\n\n-35+12ΔT <=0 => 12ΔT <=35 => ΔT <= 35/12 ≈2.916, so ΔT <=2\n\n0 <= -24+12ΔT => 24 <=12ΔT => ΔT >=2\n\nSo ΔT >=2 and <=2, so only ΔT=2, T=10.\n\nAt T=10, span [-35+24, -24+24] = [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nSo freeway 3 occupied only at T=10.\n\nFreeway y=4: same as freeway 3, since cars identical, so occupied only at T=10.\n\nFreeway y=5: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (0,-11,right,6), span [-11 +6ΔT, 0 +6ΔT] = [-11+6ΔT, 6ΔT]\n\n0 in this: since upper bound 6ΔT, lower bound -11+6ΔT.\n\n-11+6ΔT <=0 always if 6ΔT <=11, but:\n\n0 <= 6ΔT always for ΔT>=0? 0 <= 6ΔT implies ΔT >=0, always true since ΔT>=0.\n\n-11+6ΔT <=0 => 6ΔT <=11 => ΔT <= 11/6 ≈1.833, so ΔT <=1\n\nSo for ΔT=0 and ΔT=1, 0 is in span.\n\nAt ΔT=0, T=8: span [-11,0], 0 in.\n\nAt ΔT=1, T=9: [-11+6, 0+6] = [-5,6], 0 in.\n\nAt ΔT=2, T=10: [-11+12,12] = [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: (48,37,right,6), span [37+6ΔT, 48+6ΔT] >=37>0, so 0 not in.\n\nSo freeway 5 occupied at T=8 and T=9.\n\nNow freeway y=6: one car, left-moving, (0,23,left,24)\n\nSpan at T: [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT] = [0 - 24ΔT, 23 - 24ΔT]\n\n0 in [ -24ΔT, 23 - 24ΔT ]\n\nSince moving left, x decreasing.\n\n-24ΔT <= 0 <= 23 - 24ΔT\n\nFirst inequality: -24ΔT <=0 always true for ΔT>=0.\n\nSecond: 0 <= 23 - 24ΔT => 24ΔT <=23 => ΔT <= 23/24 <1, so ΔT <=0\n\nThus only for ΔT=0, T=8.\n\nAt T=8, span [0,23], 0 included.\n\nSo freeway 6 occupied only at T=8.\n\nFreeway y=7: same as y=6, (0,23,left,24), so occupied only at T=8.\n\nFreeway y=8: (48,83,left,36), span [48 - 36ΔT, 83 - 36ΔT]\n\n0 in [48-36ΔT, 83-36ΔT]\n\n48-36ΔT <=0 and 0 <= 83-36ΔT\n\nFirst: 48-36ΔT <=0 => 36ΔT >=48 => ΔT >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈1.333, so ΔT >= 2 since integer? ΔT integer.\n\n36ΔT >=48, ΔT >= 48/36 = 4/3, so ceil(4/3)=2? 36*1=36<48, 36*2=72>48, so ΔT >=2\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= 83-36ΔT => 36ΔT <=83 => ΔT <= 83/36 ≈2.305, so ΔT <=2\n\nThus ΔT >=2 and ΔT <=2, so only ΔT=2, T=10.\n\nAt T=10, span [48-72, 83-72] = [-24,11], 0 in.\n\nSo freeway 8 occupied at T=10.\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway, times when 0 is occupied (collision if player there):\n\ny=1: occupied at T=9\n\ny=2: occupied at T=8,16,17,18\n\ny=3: occupied at T=10\n\ny=4: occupied at T=10\n\ny=5: occupied at T=8,9\n\ny=6: occupied at T=8\n\ny=7: occupied at T=8\n\ny=8: occupied at T=10\n\nAnd at other times, these freeways are safe, meaning no car at x=0.\n\nNow, player starts at turn t=8, y=4.\n\nAt turn 8, y=4, which is freeway y=4? Freeways are y=1 to 8, but y=4 is one of them.\n\nAt turn 8, player is on y=4.\n\nBut at T=8, for y=4, is it occupied? From above, y=4 occupied at T=10, not at T=8.\n\ny=4: occupied at T=10, so at T=8, not occupied.\n\nSimilarly, for y=5 occupied at T=8 and T=9.\n\nBut player is at y=4 at T=8.\n\nCheck collision at turn 8: player on y=4, freeway y=4 at T=8 is not occupied, since only at T=10. So no collision at start.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\ny=9 is safe, no cars.\n\nPossible to move directly up, but need to check the path.\n\nSince we start at y=4, and need to go to y=9, we can only move up or stay, moving down might not help since we need to go up.\n\nMinimal turns: if no cars, we can go up 5 times to y=9 in 5 turns.\n\nBut with cars, we might need to wait or avoid.\n\nNow, let's see the danger times.\n\nAt turn 8:\n\n- If on y=2, occupied\n\n- y=5, occupied\n\n- y=6, occupied\n\n- y=7, occupied\n\n- y=4 not occupied, y=3 not, etc.\n\nPlayer at y=4 at T=8, safe.\n\nNow, we choose action at turn 8 to set y for turn 9.\n\nPossible actions: U (up to y=5), D (down to y=3), S (stay at y=4).\n\nIf we go up to y=5 at turn 9, but at turn 9, y=5 is occupied? At T=9, freeway y=5 is occupied, as per above.\n\nAt turn 9, if player is on y=5, collision because y=5 occupied at T=9.\n\nIf we stay at turn 8, action S, then y_{9} = y_8 =4, so at turn 9, player on y=4.\n\nAt turn 9, y=4 not occupied (only at T=10), so safe.\n\nThen from there, we can move.\n\nBut staying might not be efficient.\n\nIf we go down to y=3 at turn 9.\n\nAt turn 9, if on y=3, is it occupied? y=3 occupied at T=10, not at T=9, so safe at T=9.\n\nBut we need to go up, so going down might delay.\n\nSimilarly, other options.\n\nSince y=5 is occupied at T=8 and T=9, we cannot be on y=5 at turn 8 or 9.\n\nSimilarly, y=6 and y=7 occupied at T=8, so cannot be there at turn 8.\n\nBut at later turns, they might be safe.\n\nNow, to go to y=9, we need to pass through y=5,6,7,8 or go directly.\n\nBut y=5 is dangerous at T=8 and T=9, but safe after? At T=10, y=5 not occupied, as per above.\n\ny=5 occupied only at T=8 and T=9.\n\nSimilarly, y=6 and y=7 only at T=8, safe after.\n\ny=8 occupied at T=10.\n\nNow, let's list the safe times for each y.\n\nFor y=1: safe except T=9\n\ny=2: safe except T=8,16,17,18 — but T=16-18 are later, might not be relevant if we finish early.\n\nSince we want minimal H, probably we can finish before T=16.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\ny=3: safe except T=10\n\ny=4: safe except T=10\n\ny=5: safe except T=8,9\n\ny=6: safe except T=8\n\ny=7: safe except T=8\n\ny=8: safe except T=10\n\nNow, player at T=8, y=4, safe.\n\nWe need to get to y=9 by some turn.\n\nThe target is to have y_{t} =9 for some t.\n\nSince we start at T=8, y=4.\n\nAfter each action, y changes.\n\nLet me denote the turn sequence starting from t=8.\n\nAt turn t, we are at y_t, then choose a_t to set y_{t+1}.\n\nFor minimal turns to increase y by 5.\n\nBut with constraints.\n\nSince y=5,6,7 are safe after T=8 except specific times.\n\ny=5 unsafe at T=8 and T=9, but at T=10 and later, safe.\n\ny=6 unsafe only at T=8, so for T>8, safe.\n\nSimilarly y=7 unsafe only at T=8, so for T>8, safe.\n\ny=8 unsafe at T=10, but safe at other times.\n\ny=4 unsafe at T=10.\n\nNow, at T=8, we are at y=4.\n\nOptions:\n\n- Move up to y=5 at turn 9: but at turn 9, if y=5, collision because y=5 occupied at T=9. Not possible.\n\n- Move down to y=3 at turn 9: then at turn 9, on y=3. At T=9, y=3 is safe (only unsafe at T=10). So possible, but we go down, which might not be efficient.\n\n- Stay at y=4: then at turn 9, on y=4. At T=9, y=4 is safe (unsafe at T=10). Then from there.\n\nIf we stay at turn 8, a_8 = S, then at turn 9, y=4, safe.\n\nThen at turn 9, we can choose action.\n\nFrom y=4 at turn 9, we can:\n\n- Move up to y=5 at turn 10: but at turn 10, if we are on y=5? Action at turn 9 sets y_{10}.\n\nAt turn 9, we are at y=4, choose a_9.\n\nIf a_9 = U, then y_{10} = 5.\n\nThen at turn 10, we are on y=5.\n\nBut at T=10, y=5 is safe? y=5 unsafe at T=8 and T=9, but at T=10, not occupied, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, if a_9 = S, y_{10}=4, but at T=10, y=4 is occupied? y=4 unsafe at T=10.\n\nAt T=10, if on y=4, collision.\n\nIf a_9 = D, to y=3, then at turn 10, on y=3, and at T=10, y=3 occupied, collision.\n\nSo from turn 9 at y=4:\n\n- If a_9 = U: to y=5 at turn 10, safe since y=5 safe at T=10\n\n- If a_9 = S: to y=4 at turn 10, but T=10 y=4 unsafe, collision\n\n- If a_9 = D: to y=3 at turn 10, T=10 y=3 unsafe, collision\n\nSo only possible to move up to y=5 at turn 10.\n\nThen at turn 10, we are at y=5, safe.\n\nNow, from there, we can move up to y=6 or etc.\n\nBut y=6 is safe for T>8, so at T=10>8, safe.\n\nSimilarly y=7 safe.\n\ny=8 unsafe at T=10.\n\nNow at turn 10, we are at y=5.\n\nWe choose a_{10} to set y_{11}.\n\nPossible:\n\n- U to y=6 at turn 11\n\n- S to y=5 at turn 11\n\n- D to y=4 at turn 11, but y=4 might be unsafe, but at T=11, y=4 not occupied (only T=10), so safe, but we want to go up.\n\nIf we go up to y=6 at turn 11.\n\nThen at turn 11, on y=6, which is safe since T=11>8.\n\nSimilarly, we can continue.\n\nBut let's see the goal.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\ny=8 has a danger at T=10.\n\nAt turn 10, we are at y=5, safe.\n\nIf we move up to y=6 at turn 11, then at turn 11 on y=6, safe.\n\nThen from turn 11, we can move to y=7 at turn 12, etc.\n\nBut at turn 10, we could stay at y=5, but no need.\n\nNow, about y=8: unsafe at T=10, but at later times safe.\n\nAt turn 10, we are not on y=8 yet.\n\nLet's list a sequence.\n\nStart: T=8, y=4\n\nAction a_8: we must avoid going to y=5 at T=9, so cannot U. If D or S.\n\nEarlier I considered S.\n\nIf we do S at T=8, then T=9, y=4\n\nThen a_9 must be U, to y=5 at T=10\n\nThen T=10, y=5\n\nNow, from here, we can go U to y=6 at T=11\n\nThen T=11, y=6\n\nThen U to y=7 at T=12\n\nT=12, y=7\n\nThen U to y=8 at T=13\n\nAt T=13, on y=8. Is y=8 safe at T=13? y=8 unsafe only at T=10, so at T=13 safe.\n\nThen from y=8, U to y=9 at T=14\n\nT=14, y=9, reached.\n\nNow, turns: from start turn 8 to turn 14, that's 6 turns? Let's see the sequence.\n\nAt turn 8: start y=4\n\nAfter a_8, y_9 set.\n\nActions: a_8, a_9, a_10, a_11, a_12, a_13\n\nAfter a_13, y_14=9.\n\nNumber of actions: from t=8 to t=13, that's 6 actions? Turns: at turn t, we are at y_t.\n\nAfter H actions, we reach y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nt_1=8, after H actions, at turn t_1 + H, y=9.\n\nStart at turn t_1, y_{t_1} =4.\n\nAfter first action a_{t_1}, we have y_{t_1 +1}\n\nAfter second action a_{t_1 +1}, y_{t_1 +2}, and so on.\n\nAfter k actions, at turn t_1 + k, we have y_{t_1 + k}\n\nWe want y_{t_1 + H} =9 for some H.\n\nStart y_8 =4.\n\nAfter H actions, y_{8+H} =9.\n\nIn the sequence above:\n\nWith a_8 = S: y_9 =4\n\na_9 = U: y_10 =5\n\na_10 = U: y_11 =6\n\na_11 = U: y_12 =7\n\na_12 = U: y_13 =8\n\na_13 = U: y_14 =9\n\nSo after 6 actions, at turn 14, y=9.\n\nH=6.\n\nBut is this minimal? We started at y=4, need to go to y=9, delta y=5, so minimal 5 actions if we can go up directly.\n\nBut can we do it in 5?\n\nFor example, at turn 8, if we could go directly, but we cannot go to y=5 at turn 9 because occupied.\n\nAt turn 8, if we go down to y=3 at turn 9.\n\nThen at turn 9, y=3, safe (T=9, y=3 safe).\n\nThen from there, we can go up.\n\nBut going down first might take more turns.\n\nFor example: a_8 = D: to y=3 at T=9\n\nThen at T=9, y=3, safe.\n\nNow, we can go up to y=4 at T=10: a_9 = U\n\nBut at T=10, if on y=4, occupied, collision.\n\nCannot.\n\na_9 = S: stay at y=3, then at T=10, on y=3, but T=10 y=3 occupied, collision.\n\na_9 = D: to y=2 at T=10, but at T=10, y=2 safe? y=2 unsafe at T=8,16,17,18, so at T=10, safe.\n\nThen at T=10, on y=2, safe.\n\nThen from there, we need to go up to y=9, which will take more turns, not minimal.\n\nFor example, from y=2 at T=10, go up to y=3 at T=11, but y=3 safe at T=11 (only unsafe at T=10), then to y=4 at T=12, etc., but longer.\n\nSo not better.\n\nThus, going down is not efficient.\n\nBack to the sequence with one stay.\n\nIn the sequence with a_8=S, we have 6 actions to reach y=9 at turn 14.\n\nBut can we avoid staying?\n\nAnother idea: at turn 8, instead of staying, can we go to another y?\n\nWe are at y=4, if we go down to y=3 at turn 9.\n\nAs above, at turn 9, y=3 safe.\n\nBut then at turn 9, if we go up to y=4 at turn 10, but T=10 y=4 unsafe.\n\nIf we go directly to y=5 at turn 10? From y=3, a_9=U to y=4? y_{10} = y_9 + a_9 action.\n\nAt turn 9, y=3, choose a_9.\n\nIf a_9=U, y_{10}=4\n\nBut at T=10, if on y=4, collision.\n\nIf a_9=S, y_{10}=3, at T=10, on y=3, collision.\n\nIf a_9=D, y_{10}=2, at T=10, on y=2, safe, as above.\n\nThen we are at y=2 at turn 10, which is low, need to climb up.\n\nFor example: a_9=D to y=2 at T=10\n\nThen at T=10, y=2, safe.\n\nThen a_10=U to y=3 at T=11\n\nT=11, y=3, safe (since only unsafe at T=10)\n\na_11=U to y=4 at T=12\n\nT=12, y=4, safe (only unsafe at T=10)\n\na_12=U to y=5 at T=13\n\nT=13, y=5, safe\n\na_13=U to y=6 at T=14\n\nT=14, y=6, safe\n\na_14=U to y=7 at T=15\n\nT=15, y=7, safe\n\na_15=U to y=8 at T=16\n\nBut at T=16, y=2 is unsafe? y=2 unsafe at T=16,17,18.\n\nAt T=16, if on y=8, y=8 is safe except T=10, so at T=16 safe.\n\nThen a_16=U to y=9 at T=17\n\nBut this takes many turns, not minimal.\n\nFrom y=2 at T=10, we can move up faster, but y=5,6,7 are safe after T=9, so we can go directly.\n\nBut from y=2 to y=5, need to pass through.\n\nIn the sequence: after a_9=D to y=2 at T=10\n\nThen a_10=U to y=3 at T=11\n\na_11=U to y=4 at T=12\n\na_12=U to y=5 at T=13\n\nThen from y=5 at T=13, we can go to y=9 in 4 more actions: to y=6,7,8,9.\n\nBut from T=13 y=5 to y=9 at T=17? Let's count.\n\nT=10: y=2\n\na_10=U: y_{11}=3\n\na_11=U: y_{12}=4\n\na_12=U: y_{13}=5\n\na_13=U: y_{14}=6\n\na_14=U: y_{15}=7\n\na_15=U: y_{16}=8\n\na_16=U: y_{17}=9\n\nSo 7 actions from turn 10, but since we started from turn 8, with a_8=D to y=3 at T=9, and a_9=D to y=2 at T=10, so actions: a_8, a_9, a_10 to a_16, that's 9 actions to reach turn 17, worse than before.\n\nNot good.\n\nThus, the initial sequence with one stay is better.\n\nBut in the first sequence, we used 6 actions: from turn 8 to 13, actions at t=8 to t=13, reaching y=9 at turn 14.\n\nH=6.\n\nBut can we do with 5?\n\nSuppose we can reach y=9 by turn 13, meaning after 5 actions.\n\nStart y_8=4\n\nAfter 5 actions, y_{13}=9.\n\nSo we need to increase y by 5 in 5 turns, so all actions U, except possibly if we go down, but that would require more up, so not possible with down; must have 5 U actions.\n\nBut with U only: a_8=U: to y=5 at T=9, but at T=9, y=5 occupied, collision. Not possible.\n\nIf we delay one U, but with 5 actions, if we have one S or D, we don't reach y=9 in 5 steps.\n\nFor example, if a_8=S, then y_9=4\n\nThen to reach y_13=9, we need to increase by 5 from y_9=4 to y_13=9, so in 4 steps, must all U, but y_13=9 after 4 actions from t=9.\n\nActions at t=9,10,11,12 to set y_{10} to y_{13}.\n\ny_9=4\n\na_9=U: y_{10}=5\n\nBut at T=10, if on y=5, is it occupied? y=5 unsafe at T=8 and T=9, not at T=10, so at T=10, y=5 is safe.\n\nThen a_10=U: y_{11}=6\n\na_11=U: y_{12}=7\n\na_12=U: y_{13}=8\n\nBut y_{13}=8, not 9. Need one more to y_{14}=9.\n\nSo after 4 actions from t=9, we have y_{13}=8, then need a_13=U to y_{14}=9.\n\nBut y_{13}=8, not 9.\n\nTo reach y_{13}=9, we need y_{13}=9, so from y_9=4, we need to go to y_{13}=9, which is +5 in 4 steps, impossible because each action increases by at most 1.\n\nMaximum y after k steps from y start is y_start + k.\n\nFrom y_9=4, after 4 actions (t=9 to t=12), y_{13} <= 4+4=8.\n\ny_{13} is set after a_{12}, so y_{13} = y_{12} + a_{12} action.\n\nAfter actions at t=9,10,11,12, we have y_{10}, y_{11}, y_{12}, y_{13}.\n\ny_{10} <= y_9 +1 =5, y_{11}<=6, y_{12}<=7, y_{13}<=8.\n\nCannot reach y=9 by turn 13 with only 5 actions if we start from y=4 at t=8.\n\nWith 5 actions from t=8: actions at t=8,9,10,11,12, setting y_{9} to y_{13}.\n\ny_{13} =9.\n\nBut y_{13} <= y_8 + 5 = 4+5=9, so possible only if all actions U.\n\nBut all U: y_9=5, but at T=9, on y=5, collision.\n\nNot possible.\n\nIf we have one S, then y_{13} <= 4+4=8<9, cannot reach 9.\n\nSimilarly, if down, worse.\n\nThus impossible to reach in 5 actions.\n\nMinimal H=6.\n\nNow, in the sequence, we have one with a_8=S, then all U.\n\nBut in that sequence, we go through y=8 at T=13, which is safe.\n\nBut we can go faster in some parts.\n\nFor example, after reaching y=5 at T=10, we can go directly to y=9, but we need to pass through the rows.\n\nSince y=6 and y=7 are safe all time except T=8, which is past, we can move up quickly.\n\nIn the sequence: T=10, y=5\n\na_10=U: y_{11}=6\n\na_11=U: y_{12}=7\n\na_12=U: y_{13}=8\n\na_13=U: y_{14}=9\n\nBut at T=13, y=8, which is fine.\n\nCan we reach earlier? Turn 14 is the earliest with H=6.\n\nPerhaps from start, if we go to y=3 or something, but as before, not faster.\n\nAnother idea: at turn 8, instead of staying, can we go to y=1 or something, but y=1 is low.\n\nFor example, a_8=D to y=3 at T=9 (since y=3 safe at T=9)\n\nThen at T=9, y=3\n\nBut then at turn 9, if we go up to y=4 at T=10, collision at T=10.\n\nIf we go to y=2 at T=10: a_9=D, to y=2 at T=10\n\nThen at T=10, y=2 safe.\n\nThen we can go up, but as before, takes more turns.\n\nNot better.\n\nSo the sequence with a_8=S is efficient.\n\nBut in that sequence, we have to avoid y=4 at T=10, which we did by being at y=5 at T=10.\n\nIn the sequence, at T=10, we are at y=5, not y=4.\n\nNow, another point: freeway y=1 has a danger at T=9, but we don't go there, so irrelevant.\n\nSimilarly, y=2 dangers at T=16-18, not relevant.\n\nSo with H=6, it works.\n\nBut let's confirm the actions.\n\nTurn t_1 =8.\n\nAction sequence:\n\nTurn 8: S (stay, so y_9=4)\n\nTurn 9: U (up, to y_10=5)\n\nTurn 10: U (to y_11=6)\n\nTurn 11: U (to y_12=7)\n\nTurn 12: U (to y_13=8)\n\nTurn 13: U (to y_14=9)\n\nAfter action at turn 13, y_{14}=9, reached at turn 14.\n\nH=6 actions.\n\nBut the answer should be the actions from t_1 to t_1 + H-1.\n\nt_1=8, actions for t=8 to t=13, that is 6 actions.\n\nIn the sequence above, turn 8: S, turn 9: U, turn 10: U, turn 11: U, turn 12: U, turn 13: U.\n\nAnd we reach y=9 at turn 14.\n\nNow, but in the sequence, at turn 10, we are on y=5, which is safe.\n\nAt turn 11, y=6 safe, etc.\n\nBut y=8 at turn 13 is safe.\n\nIs there a way with H=6 but reaching earlier? Turn 14 is the earliest possible since with 5 actions we can only reach y=9 at turn 13 if all U, but not possible.\n\ny_{13} <= y_8 +5 =9, but only if all U, which causes collision at turn 9.\n\nSo no.\n\nPerhaps we can skip some rows, but we have to move sequentially, since each action changes y by at most 1.\n\nSo I think H=6 is minimal.\n\nNow, the actions:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} = S (for turn 8)\n\nIn the answer, it should be for each turn.\n\nBut let's write in the format.\n\nAlso, the car on freeway 4 is same as freeway 3, but we didn't go there at dangerous time.\n\nIn this path, we go through y=4 at turn 8 and 9, both safe; y=5 at turn 10 and 11? At turn 10, y=5; then turn 11, y=6, etc.\n\nAt turn 10, we are at y=5; we don't stay, we move up.\n\nBut all fine.\n\nTo be thorough, let's list the position at each turn.\n\nTurn T=8: y=4, freeway y=4, not occupied, safe.\n\nAction a_8=S, so y_{9}=4\n\nTurn T=9: y=4, freeway y=4, not occupied (only at T=10), safe.\n\nAction a_9=U, so y_{10}=5\n\nTurn T=10: y=5, freeway y=5, not occupied (only at T=8,9), so safe.\n\nAction a_10=U, y_{11}=6\n\nTurn T=11: y=6, freeway y=6, not occupied (only at T=8), safe.\n\nAction a_11=U, y_{12}=7\n\nTurn T=12: y=7, freeway y=7, not occupied, safe.\n\nAction a_12=U, y_{13}=8\n\nTurn T=13: y=8, freeway y=8, not occupied (only at T=10), safe.\n\nAction a_13=U, y_{14}=9\n\nTurn T=14: y=9, reached, no cars, safe.\n\nPerfect.\n\nAnd H=6.\n\nNow, is there another sequence with H=6?\n\nFor example, at some point we could move faster, but no, we moved up as soon as possible except the initial stay.\n\nAfter y=5 at T=10, we moved up each turn.\n\nWe could have stayed at some point, but that would make H larger.\n\nFor example, if we stay at y=5 at some turn, but not necessary.\n\nSo this should be minimal.\n\nAnother possibility: at turn 8, go down to y=3, but then we need more steps.\n\nNot better.\n\nSo I think this is fine.\n\nNow, the answer format.\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 +1}\n\n...\n\nUp to turn t_1 + H -1\n\nHere t_1=8, H=6, so actions from turn 8 to turn 13.\n\nt_1 + H -1 = 8 + 6 -1 =13.\n\nYes.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 8: S\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nIn the sequence, turn 9 is t_1 +1, etc.\n\nt_1=8, so:\n\nTurn 8: S\n\nTurn 9: U  (which is t_1 +1)\n\nTurn 10: U  (t_1 +2)\n\n...\n\nTurn 13: U  (t_1 +5)\n\nSince H=6, turns from t_1 to t_1+5.\n\nt_1 to t_1 + H -1 = t_1 to t_1 +5.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, in the box.\n\nBut let's make sure about the car on freeway 2 at T=8, but we didn't go there.\n\nAll good.\n\nPerhaps we can go to y=6 directly, but we have to go through y=5.\n\nNo.\n\nAnother thing: at turn 10, if we are at y=5, we could go to y=6 immediately, which we did.\n\ny=6 is safe at T=11, etc.\n\nI think it's correct.\n\nSo the minimal H is 6, with the sequence above.\n</think>\nThe goal is to reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 4) at turn \\(t_1 = 8\\) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\), avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis:\n- The player starts at \\(y = 4\\) on turn 8.\n- To reach \\(y = 9\\), the player must increase \\(y\\) by 5, requiring at least 5 turns if moving up (U) every turn.

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at position (0,4) at turn t1 = 9. The goal is to reach (0,9) in the minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. Each turn, the player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing the y-position by +1, -1, or 0, respectively, and y must stay within 0 to 9.\n\nCollision occurs only if at some turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T where for that freeway, there's a car such that 0 is in its span at that exact turn T. The note says that when you move, you're not on the new row until the next turn. So at turn T, if you're on y_T, and you move to y_{T+1}, at turn T you're still on y_T, so you only check cars on y_T for collision at turn T.\n\nThe car positions are given at turn t1=9, and we need to compute their positions at future turns based on their direction and speed.\n\nLet me list all the cars for each freeway at t1=9:\n\n- Freeway 1 (y=1): one car: head=0, tail=-47, direction=right, speed=48. Since it's right-moving, the span is [τ, h] which is [-47, 0]. Direction right means it's moving to the right, so positions increase. Head is at 0, tail at -47, so at t1, span is [tail, head] = [-47, 0] for right-moving? Let me check the update rule.\n\nFrom the car update:\n\n- Left-moving: span at t1 is [h, τ] → at T, [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\n- Right-moving: span at t1 is [τ, h] → at T, [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nFor freeway 1: direction right, so at t1, span is [τ, h] = [-47, 0]. Speed s=48.\n\nAt turn T, span is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] = [-47 + 48(T-9), 0 + 48(T-9)]\n\nCollision at turn T if player is on this freeway and 0 is in the span at T, meaning min(span) ≤ 0 ≤ max(span).\n\nFor right-moving, span at T is [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] where ΔT = T - t1.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving.\n\nNow, player is on freeway y at turn T only when y_T = y.\n\nBut for collision, it's only when player is on that freeway at that turn.\n\nAlso, player starts at y=4 at t1=9.\n\nGoal is to reach y=9.\n\nNow, I need to find a sequence of actions to go from y=4 to y=9 in min turns, avoiding being on a freeway when 0 is covered by a car on that freeway at that turn.\n\nSince we need min turns, and y increases only when we go up, probably we want to go up as much as possible, but we have to avoid the cars.\n\ny from 4 to 9, difference is 5, so min turns if no obstacles is 5 turns, all U. But with cars, we might need to wait or something.\n\nBut we can only move one step per turn, so min H is at least 5.\n\nNow, let's compute for each freeway, when 0 is covered by a car, so that we know when it's unsafe to be on that row.\n\nSince the player moves vertically, and cars move horizontally, the rows are independent in terms of when 0 is occupied.\n\nFor each row y=1 to 8, and for each car on that row, we can find the times T when 0 is in the car's span at that T.\n\nThen, for that row, the unsafe times are when any car on that row has 0 in span.\n\nThen, to be safe on row y at turn T, we need that at that T, for row y, 0 is not in any car's span.\n\nSince the cars on a row are fixed, we can find for each row the set of T where it's unsafe.\n\nT is discrete, turns.\n\nt1=9, so T=9,10,11,... etc.\n\nFirst, let's list all cars per row.\n\nFrom the table:\n\nFreeway 1 (y=1): one car: (head=0, tail=-47, dir=right, speed=48)\n\nSince dir right, at t1=9, span [τ, h] = [-47, 0]\n\nAt T, span [ -47 + 48(ΔT), 0 + 48(ΔT) ] where ΔT = T - 9\n\n0 is in span if min <= 0 <= max, i.e., -47 + 48(ΔT) <= 0 <= 48(ΔT)\n\nSince max is 48(ΔT), min is -47 + 48(ΔT)\n\n0 <= 48(ΔT) is always true for ΔT >=0, since 48(ΔT) >=0.\n\n-47 + 48(ΔT) <= 0 implies 48(ΔT) <= 47, so ΔT <= 47/48 < 1, so ΔT <=0 since ΔT integer.\n\nΔT = T-9, integer >=0.\n\n-47 + 48(ΔT) <= 0 ⇒ 48(ΔT) <= 47 ⇒ ΔT <= 47/48 < 1, so ΔT <=0.\n\nAnd 0 <= 48(ΔT) always for ΔT >=0.\n\nSo for ΔT >=1, min = -47 + 48(ΔT) >= -47 +48(1) =1 >0, so min >0, thus 0 not in [min,max] since min>0.\n\nFor ΔT=0, min = -47 +0 = -47 <=0, max=0 <=0? max=48(0)=0, so [ -47, 0], so 0 is included since max=0.\n\nAt T=t1=9, ΔT=0, span=[-47,0], so 0 is in it.\n\nFor ΔT=0, min=-47 <=0, max=0, so 0 <= max is 0<=0 true, min<=0 true, so yes.\n\nFor ΔT=1, min=-47+48=1, max=48, so [1,48], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly for higher.\n\nSo for freeway 1, unsafe only at T=9.\n\nAt T=9, if player on y=1, collision, but at T=9, player is on y=4, not y=1, so no issue at start.\n\nBut for future, if player goes to y=1 at some T>9, it might be unsafe only if T=9, but T=9 is past, so for T>9, always safe on y=1? From above, for T>9, ΔT>=1, min>=1>0, so 0 not in span, so safe.\n\nBut let's confirm: at T=10, ΔT=1, span [ -47+48=1, 0+48=48] = [1,48], 0 not in, yes.\n\nSimilarly, no other cars on y=1.\n\nSo for freeway 1, unsafe only at T=9, but since T=9 is current and player not on it, for future turns, y=1 is always safe to be on.\n\nNow freeway 2 (y=2): three cars:\n\nFirst: (-28, -39, right, 4)  head and tail? The notation is (head, tail, dir, speed)\n\nFor right-moving, head should be larger? Let's see: (-28, -39, right, 4)\n\nIn the update, for right-moving, span at t1 is [τ, h], so τ is tail, h is head.\n\nHere given as (head, tail)? No, the table says \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nLook: \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nThen for direction, it specifies how span is given.\n\nFor right-moving, the span at t1 is [τ, h], meaning from tail to head.\n\nBut in the input, it's listed as (head, tail, ...), which might be confusing.\n\nFor example, freeway 2, first car: head h= -28? tail τ= -39? and dir right.\n\nBut for right-moving, if head is at -28, tail at -39, that means tail is left of head, so if moving right, positions increasing.\n\nAt t1, span [τ, h] = [-39, -28]? τ is tail, h is head.\n\nGiven: (head h, tail τ, dir, speed) = (-28, -39, right, 4)\n\nSo head = -28, tail = -39.\n\nSince dir right, at t1, the span is [τ, h] = [-39, -28]\n\nThen at T, [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] = [-39 + 4ΔT, -28 + 4ΔT]\n\n0 in span if min <= 0 <= max, i.e., -39 + 4ΔT <= 0 <= -28 + 4ΔT\n\nNow, 0 <= -28 + 4ΔT ⇒ 4ΔT >= 28 ⇒ ΔT >= 7\n\nAnd -39 + 4ΔT <= 0 ⇒ 4ΔT <= 39 ⇒ ΔT <= 9.75, so ΔT <=9 since integer.\n\nSo for ΔT from 7 to 9 inclusive, 0 in span.\n\nΔT = T-9, so T=9+7=16 to T=9+9=18.\n\nSimilarly, second car on y=2: (48, 37, right, 4) head=48, tail=37, dir right.\n\nAt t1, span [τ, h] = [37,48]\n\nAt T, [37 + 4ΔT, 48 + 4ΔT]\n\n0 in span? min=37+4ΔT >=37>0 for ΔT>=0, so min>0, 0 not in span, always safe for this car.\n\nThird car on y=2: (12, 1, right, 4) head=12, tail=1, dir right.\n\nAt t1, span [τ, h] = [1,12]\n\nAt T, [1 + 4ΔT, 12 + 4ΔT]\n\nmin=1+4ΔT >=1>0 for ΔT>=0, so always min>0, 0 not in span.\n\nSo for y=2, only the first car can have 0 in span, from T=16 to T=18.\n\nUnsafe times for y=2: T=16,17,18.\n\nNow freeway 3 (y=3): two cars.\n\nFirst: (36, 25, right, 12) head=36, tail=25, dir right.\n\nAt t1, span [τ, h] = [25,36]\n\nAt T, [25 + 12ΔT, 36 + 12ΔT]\n\nmin=25+12ΔT>0, always safe.\n\nSecond: (-12, -23, right, 12) head=-12, tail=-23, dir right.\n\nAt t1, span [τ, h] = [-23, -12]\n\nAt T, [-23 + 12ΔT, -12 + 12ΔT]\n\n0 in span if -23 +12ΔT <= 0 <= -12 +12ΔT\n\nLeft: -23 +12ΔT <=0 ⇒ 12ΔT <=23 ⇒ ΔT <= 23/12 ≈ 1.916, so ΔT <=1\n\nRight: 0 <= -12 +12ΔT ⇒ 12ΔT >=12 ⇒ ΔT >=1\n\nSo for ΔT=1, both: -23+12= -11 <=0, and 0 <= -12+12=0, so 0<=0 true, min<=0 true.\n\nFor ΔT=0: min=-23 <=0, max=-12, 0 <= -12? 0 <= -12 false, so not.\n\nΔT=1: min=-23+12= -11 <=0, max=-12+12=0, so 0 in [ -11, 0], yes.\n\nΔT=2: min=-23+24=1, max=-12+24=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo only at ΔT=1, T=10.\n\nUnsafe for this car only at T=10.\n\nFirst car always safe, so for y=3, unsafe only at T=10.\n\nNow freeway 4 (y=4): same as y=3? \"4 | (36, 25, right, 12), (-12, -23, right, 12) |\" identical to y=3.\n\nSo similarly, unsafe only at T=10.\n\nBut at T=10, for y=4, the second car: at T, with ΔT=1, span [-23+12(1), -12+12(1)] = [-11, 0], so 0 in span, yes.\n\nFirst car safe.\n\nSo y=4 unsafe at T=10.\n\nNow, player starts at y=4 at T=9.\n\nAt T=9, for y=4, is it unsafe?\n\nAt T=9, ΔT=0, for the second car: span at t1 is [τ,h] for right? dir right, span [τ,h] = [-23,-12] at t1=9.\n\n0 in [-23,-12]? -23 <=0<= -12? 0 <= -12 false, so 0 not in span at T=9.\n\nSimilarly, first car [25,36], 0 not in.\n\nSo at T=9, y=4 is safe.\n\nBut at T=10, unsafe.\n\nPlayer is at y=4 at T=9, so if player stays at y=4 at T=10, collision? At turn T, if player is on y_T and 0 in span for that row.\n\nAt turn T=10, if player is on y=4, then check cars on y=4 at T=10.\n\nAt T=10, ΔT=1, for second car: [-11,0], 0 in it, so collision.\n\nSo player cannot be on y=4 at T=10.\n\nSimilarly, for other rows.\n\nNow freeway 5 (y=5): two cars.\n\nFirst: (6, -5, right, 6) head=6, tail=-5, dir right.\n\nAt t1, span [τ, h] = [-5,6]\n\nAt T, [-5 +6ΔT, 6 +6ΔT]\n\n0 in span if -5 +6ΔT <=0 <=6 +6ΔT\n\nRight: 0 <=6+6ΔT always true since min is negative or small.\n\nLeft: -5+6ΔT <=0 ⇒ 6ΔT <=5 ⇒ ΔT <=5/6<1, so ΔT<=0\n\nFor ΔT=0: min=-5<=0, max=6, 0 in [-5,6], yes.\n\nΔT=1: min=1, max=12, 0 not in.\n\nSo only at ΔT=0, T=9.\n\nSecond car: (54,43,right,6) head=54, tail=43, span [43,54], min>0, always safe.\n\nSo for y=5, unsafe only at T=9.\n\nAt T=9, if on y=5, collision.\n\nBut player starts at y=4, not on y=5.\n\nFor future, if player goes to y=5 at T>9, it should be safe since only unsafe at T=9.\n\nAt T=10, ΔT=1, min= -5+6=1>0, so safe.\n\nNow freeway 6 (y=6): one car: (-24, -1, left, 24)\n\nDirection left, so for left-moving, span at t1 is [h, τ] = [head, tail]\n\nGiven head=-24, tail=-1, dir left.\n\nBut head and tail: typically for left-moving, head is left, tail right? Let's see the update.\n\nFor left-moving: span at t1 is [h, τ], and at T, [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT]\n\nHere, head h=-24, tail τ=-1.\n\nSince left-moving, positions decrease.\n\nAt t1, span [h, τ] = [-24, -1]  // from head to tail, so min h, max τ? [-24, -1], min=-24, max=-1.\n\nThen at T, [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT] = [-24 -24ΔT, -1 -24ΔT]\n\n0 in span if min <=0<=max, i.e., -24 -24ΔT <=0 <= -1 -24ΔT\n\nRight: 0 <= -1 -24ΔT? But -1 -24ΔT <= -1 <0, so 0 <= negative number false, so never true.\n\nLeft: -24-24ΔT <=0 always true since negative.\n\nBut right inequality false, so 0 never in span for this car.\n\nBecause the car is at negative positions and moving left, so positions more negative, never reach 0.\n\nSo for y=6, always safe, no car covers 0 at any time.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 7 (y=7): same as y=6? \"7 | (-24, -1, left, 24) |\" identical.\n\nSo similarly, always safe.\n\nNow freeway 8 (y=8): one car: (12, 47, left, 36)\n\nHead=12, tail=47, dir left.\n\nFor left-moving, span at t1 [h, τ] = [12,47]\n\nAt T, [12 -36ΔT, 47 -36ΔT]\n\n0 in span if 12 -36ΔT <=0 <=47 -36ΔT\n\nLeft: 12-36ΔT <=0 ⇒ -36ΔT <= -12 ⇒ ΔT >= 12/36 = 1/3, so ΔT >=1\n\nRight: 0 <=47 -36ΔT ⇒ 36ΔT <=47 ⇒ ΔT <=47/36≈1.305, so ΔT <=1\n\nSo for ΔT=1, left: 12-36= -24 <=0 true, right: 0 <=47-36=11 true, so 0 in [-24,11], yes.\n\nFor ΔT=0: min=12, max=47, 12>0, 0 not <= min? 0 <= min false since min=12>0.\n\nΔT=2: min=12-72= -60, max=47-72= -25, both negative, 0 not <= max? max=-25<0, so 0 <= max false.\n\nSo only at ΔT=1, T=10.\n\nUnsafe at T=10 for y=8.\n\nNow, summarize for each row y=1 to 8, unsafe times:\n\ny=1: unsafe only at T=9, so for T>=10, safe.\n\ny=2: unsafe at T=16,17,18\n\ny=3: unsafe at T=10\n\ny=4: unsafe at T=10\n\ny=5: unsafe only at T=9, so for T>=10, safe.\n\ny=6: always safe\n\ny=7: always safe\n\ny=8: unsafe at T=10\n\nPlayer starts at T=9, y=4.\n\nAt T=9, y=4 is safe, as we saw.\n\nGoal: reach y=9.\n\ny=9 is the top, no cars, always safe.\n\nNow, player can move U, D, S each turn.\n\nWe need to go from y=4 to y=9 in min turns.\n\nPossible actions: each move changes y by at most 1, so min 5 turns if all up.\n\nBut we have to avoid unsafe times on the rows.\n\nSince y=6 and y=7 are always safe, we can stay there if needed.\n\ny=1 is safe after T=9, but since we start at y=4 and go up, probably not needed to go down.\n\nSimilarly, y=5 is safe after T=9.\n\nNow, the unsafe times:\n\nAt T=10, y=3, y=4, y=8 are unsafe.\n\ny=3,4,8 unsafe at T=10.\n\nOther rows safe at T=10.\n\ny=1 safe after T=9, y=2 safe except T=16-18, which are later, y=5 safe after T=9, y=6,7 always safe.\n\nPlayer at T=9: y=4, safe.\n\nNow T=10: we need to choose action for turn T=10.\n\nAt turn T=10, player position y_{10} depends on action at T=9? Let's see the timing.\n\nDefine turns: at turn t, player has position y_t, then chooses action a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy based on a_t.\n\nAnd at each turn t, we check if on row y_t, 0 is in car span for that row at time t.\n\nFor turn t=9: y=4, which is safe as above.\n\nNow, we choose action a_{9}, which determines y_{10}.\n\nThen at turn t=10, we have y_{10}, and we check for collision at t=10.\n\nSimilarly for future turns.\n\nWe need to reach y_t =9 for some t, min t.\n\nStart at t=9, y=4.\n\nWe want to increase y to 9.\n\nBut at t=10, y=3,4,8 are unsafe.\n\nSo at t=10, we cannot be on y=3, y=4, or y=8.\n\nPossible y_{10} after action at t=9.\n\nFrom y=4 at t=9, possible actions:\n\n- U: then y_{10} = 4 +1 =5\n\n- D: y_{10} =4 -1=3\n\n- S: y_{10} =4\n\nBut at t=10, y=3,4,5? y=5 is safe at t=10? y=5 unsafe only at t=9, so at t=10, safe.\n\ny=3 unsafe at t=10, y=4 unsafe at t=10, y=5 safe at t=10.\n\nIf we go U at t=9, y_{10}=5, which is safe at t=10.\n\nIf S, y_{10}=4, unsafe at t=10, collision.\n\nIf D, y_{10}=3, unsafe at t=10, collision.\n\nSo only possible action at t=9 is U, to y_{10}=5.\n\nThen at t=10, y=5, safe.\n\nNow, from here, we need to go to y=9.\n\nPossible to go up.\n\nAt t=10, y=5.\n\nNow, action for t=10: we can choose U, D, or S.\n\nIf U, y_{11} =6\n\nIf S, y_{11}=5\n\nIf D, y_{11}=4\n\nNow, at t=11, what is unsafe?\n\nWe need to check for each row at t=11.\n\nFirst, list unsafe times again, but we have for specific times.\n\nGenerally, for t=11, ΔT = t -9.\n\nFor y=1: safe for t>9\n\ny=2: unsafe at t=16,17,18, so at t=11, safe\n\ny=3: unsafe only at t=10, so at t=11, safe\n\ny=4: unsafe only at t=10, so at t=11, safe\n\ny=5: unsafe only at t=9, so at t=11, safe\n\ny=6: always safe\n\ny=7: always safe\n\ny=8: unsafe only at t=10, so at t=11, safe\n\nSo at t=11, all rows are safe.\n\nSimilarly, for future, until t=16, y=2 might be unsafe, but we may not need to go there.\n\nNow, at t=10, y=5, safe.\n\nWe can go up to y=6,7,8,9.\n\nBut y=8 is safe at t=11? At t=11, y=8 safe, as above.\n\nNow, to reach y=9, we need to be at y=8 first or go directly.\n\nSince we can move one step.\n\nNow, min turns: from y=5 at t=10, to y=9.\n\ny=9 is 4 steps up, so min 4 more turns, reach at t=14.\n\nBut we need to check if possible without collision.\n\nSince all rows are safe at least until t=16 except y=2 at t=16-18, but we are going up, so y=6 and y=7 are always safe, so we can go directly up.\n\nAt t=10, y=5.\n\nAction a_{10}: if U, y_{11}=6\n\nThen at t=11, on y=6, which is safe (always).\n\nThen a_{11}: U, y_{12}=7\n\nt=12, y=7 safe.\n\na_{12}: U, y_{13}=8\n\nNow at t=13, on y=8.\n\nIs y=8 safe at t=13?\n\ny=8 unsafe only at t=10, so at t=13, safe.\n\nThen a_{13}: U, y_{14}=9\n\nt=14, y=9, goal reached.\n\nNow, need to check if during this, any collision.\n\nt=10: y=5, safe\n\nt=11: y=6, safe\n\nt=12: y=7, safe\n\nt=13: y=8, safe\n\nt=14: y=9, safe\n\nAll good.\n\nBut at t=13, y=8 is safe, yes.\n\nWe could go faster? From t=10, y=5, to y=9 in fewer than 4 turns? No, because each move changes by 1, so from y=5 to y=9, need 4 steps, so min at t=14.\n\nStart at t=9, y=4, after action to t=10 y=5, then to t=14 y=9, so turns from t=9 to t=14, actions at t=9 to t=13? Let's see the sequence.\n\nPlayer position:\n\nt=9: y=4 (after action? No)\n\nAt turn t, before action, position is y_t.\n\nThen after action, position for next turn.\n\nDefine:\n\nAt the start of turn t, player is at position y_t.\n\nThen chooses action a_t, which determines y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy(a_t)\n\nThen at turn t, we check collision based on y_t and cars at time t.\n\nFor turn t, position y_t is used to check against cars on row y_t at time t.\n\nIn this case:\n\nt=9: y_9=4, safe, as before.\n\nAction a_9: we must choose U, so y_{10} = 4 +1 =5\n\nt=10: y_{10}=5, and we check at t=10: y=5 is safe? At t=10, y=5: unsafe only at t=9, but t=10, so safe. Yes.\n\nThen action a_{10}: we can choose, say U, then y_{11}=6\n\nt=11: y_{11}=6, safe.\n\na_{11}: U, y_{12}=7\n\nt=12: y=7, safe.\n\na_{12}: U, y_{13}=8\n\nt=13: y=8, safe? At t=13, y=8: unsafe only at t=10, so yes safe.\n\na_{13}: U, y_{14}=9\n\nt=14: y=9, reached.\n\nNow, H is the number of turns? The sequence of actions from t_1 to t_1 + H-1, and at turn t_1 + H -1, position is (0,9).\n\nt_1 =9.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t_1 + H, position y_{t_1 + H}\n\nBut we need y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nLet's see:\n\nStart: at turn t_1=9, position (0,y_{t_1}) = (0,4)\n\nAfter actions {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1}, so actions at times t_1, t_1+1, ..., t_1 + H-1\n\nThen after these actions, the position at turn t_1 + H should be such that at turn t_1 + H -1, position is (0,9)? I think I confused.\n\nThe player update: after action at turn t, position for turn t+1 is set.\n\nAt turn T, position y_T is before action.\n\nAfter action a_T, y_{T+1} is set.\n\nWe need that at some turn, say T, y_T =9.\n\nIn the sequence, after H actions, from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, so actions at t_1, t_1+1, ..., t_1 + H -1.\n\nAfter action at t_1 + H -1, y_{t_1 + H} is set.\n\nBut we need that at turn t_1 + H -1, position is (0,9).\n\nThe problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1\"\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1\"\n\nIn the task: \"such that y_{t_1 + H -1} =9\"\n\nAnd \"reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1\"\n\nIn the answer, we output actions from turn t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nIn this case, for us, with H=5, actions at t=9,10,11,12,13, and at turn t=13 (which is t_1 + H -1 =9+5-1=13), y_{13}=9? Let's see:\n\nt=9: y_9=4\n\nAfter a_9=U, y_{10}=5\n\nt=10: y_{10}=5\n\nAfter a_{10}=U, y_{11}=6\n\nt=11: y_{11}=6\n\nAfter a_{11}=U, y_{12}=7\n\nt=12: y_{12}=7\n\nAfter a_{12}=U, y_{13}=8\n\nt=13: y_{13}=8\n\nAfter a_{13}=U, y_{14}=9\n\nSo at turn t=13, y=8, not 9.\n\nWe need y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =13, y_{13}=8, not 9.\n\nProblem: we reach y=9 at t=14, so at turn t=14, y=9.\n\nt=14 = t_1 + 5, since t_1=9, 9+5=14.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =14? Then H-1=5, H=6.\n\nSet T = t_1 + H -1, we need y_T=9.\n\nT = t_1 + H -1.\n\nStart at t_1=9, y=4.\n\nAfter k actions, we are at turn t_1 + k, position y_{t_1 + k}\n\nAfter 0 actions, at turn t_1, y_{t_1}\n\nAfter 1 action, at turn t_1 +1, y_{t_1 +1}\n\n...\n\nAfter m actions, at turn t_1 + m, y_{t_1 + m}\n\nWe need y_{t_1 + m} =9 for some m, and m min.\n\nThen H, the number of turns, should be such that at turn t_1 + H -1, y=9.\n\nSo if we reach at turn T, with T = t_1 + m, then y_T=9, and m is the number of actions? Actions from t_1 to T-1.\n\nFor example, to be at y=9 at turn T, we need actions from t_1 to T-1 to move there.\n\nStart at t_1=9, y=4.\n\nIf we do nothing, stay at y=4, but we need to go to 9.\n\nMin T to reach y=9.\n\nFrom y=4 to y=9, need at least 5 steps up, so min T=14, with y_14=9.\n\nThen at turn T=14, y=9.\n\nT = t_1 + H -1 =14\n\nt_1=9, so 9 + H -1 =14, so H-1=5, H=6.\n\nThe sequence of actions: from turn t_1 to t_1 + H -2? Actions at times t_1 to t_1 + H -1, for H actions.\n\n{ a_{t_1 + t} }_{t=0}^{H-1} so t from 0 to H-1, so actions at t_1, t_1+1, ..., t_1 + H -1.\n\nAnd after these actions, at turn t_1 + H, position is set, but we need at turn t_1 + H -1, position is (0,9).\n\nIn the sequence above, with actions at t=9 to t=13 (5 actions: t=9,10,11,12,13), then at turn t=14, y=9.\n\nBut we need at turn t_1 + H -1 =9 + H -1 to be 9.\n\nSet 9 + H -1 =14, so H-1=5, H=6.\n\nThen actions at t_1 to t_1 +5, i.e., t=9 to 14? t from 0 to H-1=5, so t_1 +0 to t_1 +5, t=9 to 14.\n\nBut at turn t=14, we are performing action? No.\n\nThe action is chosen at the turn.\n\nAt turn T, we choose a_T, then y_{T+1} is set based on a_T.\n\nWe need y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nFor T = t_1 + H -1, y_T=9.\n\nIn our plan, we can have y_{14}=9.\n\nSo T=14.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =14\n\n9 + H -1 =14, so H-1=5, H=6.\n\nThen actions for t from 0 to H-1=5, so actions at times t_1 + t for t=0 to 5, i.e., t=9,10,11,12,13,14.\n\nBut at turn t=14, if we set action, it affects y_{15}, but we don't care since we already at y_{14}=9.\n\nIn the sequence, we need to specify actions from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, which includes the turn when we reach.\n\nBut at the turn when y_T=9, we don't need to move, we can stay or whatever, but since we reached, action doesn't matter, but we have to specify.\n\nIn this case, with H=6, actions at t=9 to t=14.\n\nBut at t=14, we are at y=9, so action could be S, but it doesn't change position.\n\nNow, back to the sequence.\n\nWith the actions I had: from t=9 to t=13, actions U,U,U,U,U to go from y=4 to y=9 in 5 steps, reaching y=9 at t=14.\n\nBut with H=6, we need to include action at t=14.\n\nSince we are already at y=9 at t=14, we can set a_{14}=S, for example.\n\nBut we need to output actions from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, which is t=9 to t=14 for H=6.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =9+6-1=14, yes.\n\nActions: a9, a10, a11, a12, a13, a14.\n\nIn the sequence: at t=9: U to y10=5\n\nt=10: U to y11=6\n\n...\n\nt=13: U to y14=9\n\nt=14: at this turn, y14=9, we need to specify action, but since we reached at this turn, we can do S, for example.\n\nBut the action at t=14 doesn't affect position since we stay or move, but y15 would be set, but we don't care.\n\nNow, in this sequence, all safe as before.\n\nBut is there a way to reach earlier?\n\nMin T to y=9: from y=4, need to increase by 5, so min T=14.\n\nWith H=6, since t_1 + H -1=14.\n\nH=6 turns.\n\nBut earlier I thought with actions from t=9 to t=13 (5 actions) reach at t=14, but the turn when we reach is t=14, which is t_1 +5.\n\nt_1 + m =14, m=5, but H is number of turns in sequence.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =14, H=6.\n\nYes.\n\nPerhaps we can reach faster by going down and up, but that would take more turns, not fewer.\n\nFor example, from y=4 at t=9, if we go down to y=3 or something, but at t=10, y=3 is unsafe, so we cannot.\n\nOnly choice is to go up to y=5 at t=10.\n\nThen from there, we can go directly up as I did.\n\nBut at t=10, y=5, we could stay or go down, but going down would delay, so not better.\n\nSo min is to go up each time.\n\nBut in my sequence, from t=10 y=5 to t=11 y=6, etc.\n\nBut at t=13, y=8, then to y=9 at t=14.\n\nNow, but y=8 at t=13 is safe, as we said.\n\nIs there a way to be at y=9 earlier? No, because at t=10, we are at y=5, earliest to y=9 is t=14.\n\nUnless we can skip some, but no, one step per turn.\n\nSo min H=6, with actions U,U,U,U,U and then at t=14 S or something.\n\nBut in the sequence, actions at t=9 to t=13 are U, and at t=14, since we reached, we can set S.\n\nBut we need to output for each turn from t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nt_1=9, H=6, so turns 9 to 14.\n\nActions: turn 9: U\n\nturn 10: U\n\nturn 11: U\n\nturn 12: U\n\nturn 13: U\n\nturn 14: S  (or U, but no need)\n\nAt turn 14, if we set U, y15=10, but y=10 invalid, since y=0 to9, so y_{t+1} must be in [0,9], so if at y=9, U would be invalid? The player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, with y_{t+1} in [0,9], so if at y=9, cannot go U, similarly at y=0 cannot go D.\n\nIn this case, at t=14, y=9, so action a_{14} cannot be U, because y_{15} =9+1=10>9, invalid. Similarly, D to 8, but we are at 9, but we need to be at 9, so should stay.\n\nSo a_{14} must be S.\n\nSimilarly, in the sequence.\n\nNow, but in my earlier, at t=13, y=8, a_{13}=U, y_{14}=9.\n\nThen at t=14, y=9, a_{14}=S, y_{15}=9, but we don't care.\n\nAnd at turn t=14, we are at (0,9).\n\nNow, but we need to confirm if at any point collision.\n\nt=9: y=4, safe\n\na9=U\n\nt=10: y=5, safe? At t=10, y=5: unsafe only at t=9, so t=10 safe. Yes.\n\na10=U\n\nt=11: y=6, safe (always)\n\na11=U\n\nt=12: y=7, safe (always)\n\na12=U\n\nt=13: y=8, safe? At t=13, y=8: unsafe only at t=10, so t=13 safe. Yes.\n\na13=U\n\nt=14: y=9, safe, and reached.\n\na14=S, but not necessary for reaching, but we have to specify.\n\nNow, H=6.\n\nBut is there a shorter sequence? H min.\n\nSuppose we can reach at t=13.\n\nIs it possible to be at y=9 at t=13?\n\nt=13 = t_1 +4, since t_1=9, 13=9+4.\n\ny at t=13=9.\n\nStart at t=9, y=4.\n\nAfter 4 actions, to y=9.\n\nBut from y=4 to y=9, need +5, so impossible in 4 steps, min 5 steps, so y at t=14 is earliest.\n\nThus min H=6.\n\nWith actions as above.\n\nBut in the sequence, for t=14, action S.\n\nNow, but we need to output the actions.\n\nIn the answer format.\n\nBut let's write the actions.\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} = U (since at t=9, we go U)\n\nIn the sequence, turn t_1: a_{t_1} , which is action at turn t_1.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: S\n\nBut for turn 14, it is turn t_1 + H -1 =9+6-1=14, yes.\n\nIn the sequence, we have 6 actions.\n\nPerhaps we don't need action at turn 14 if we reached at turn 13, but we can't.\n\nAnother thing: at t=10, when we are at y=5, instead of going up immediately, we could stay or something, but that would delay, so not better.\n\nFor example, if at t=10, y=5, we stay, y_{11}=5, then later go up, but we reach later, say t=15 or something, worse.\n\nSo min is to go up each time.\n\nBut we have to ensure that y=8 is safe at t=13.\n\ny=8 unsafe only at t=10, so t=13 safe.\n\nSimilarly, all intermediate rows safe at those times.\n\ny=6 and y=7 always safe.\n\ny=5 at t=10 safe.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nBut earlier I thought about y=2 unsafe at t=16-18, but we don't go there.\n\nSo should be fine.\n\nPerhaps we can go faster by using other rows, but no need.\n\nSo minimal H=6.\n\nBut let's confirm the answer format.\n\nThe sequence should be for turns from t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nt_1=9, H=6, so turns 9 to 14.\n\nActions: U, U, U, U, U, S\n\nBut at turn 14, action S.\n\nIn the output:\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: S\n\nBut turn 14 is t_1 + 5, since t_1 + H -1 =14, H=6, t_1 +5=14? t_1=9, 9+5=14, yes.\n\nt from 0 to 5, t_1 + t.\n\nNow, but in the car state, for freeway 4 and 3, they have cars, but we didn't go there except at start.\n\nAnother point: at t=10, y=4 is unsafe, but we are not there.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nI think it's correct.\n\nBut let's see if we can reach in H=5.\n\nH=5, then t_1 + H -1 =9+5-1=13.\n\nWe need y_{13}=9.\n\nBut from y_9=4, to y_{13}=9 in 4 steps? From turn 10 to 13, positions y10 to y13.\n\ny10 after action at t=9.\n\ny9=4, after a9, y10=?\n\nTo reach y13=9, need to increase by 5 in 4 steps? From y10 to y13, that's 3 positions: y10, y11, y12, then after a12, y13.\n\nThe values: at t=9, y9=4\n\nAfter a9, y10\n\nAt t=10, y10\n\nAfter a10, y11\n\n...\n\nAfter a12, y13\n\nAt t=13, y13\n\nTo have y13=9, and y9=4, difference 5, but we have actions at t=9,10,11,12, four actions.\n\nEach action can change y by at most 1, so max increase 4, from 4 to 8, cannot reach 9 in four actions.\n\ny10 = y9 + Δa9 <=5\n\ny11 <= y10 +1 <=6\n\ny12 <=7\n\ny13 <=8 <9\n\nSo impossible to reach y13=9 from y9=4 with four actions.\n\nThus min at y14=9 with five actions, H=6.\n\nSo yes.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is actions at t=9 to t=14: U,U,U,U,U,S\n\nBut at t=14, S is fine.\n\nNow, in the output, we need to write for each turn.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 2, it has unsafe at t=16-18, but not relevant.\n\nAlso, for freeway 1, unsafe only at t=9, etc.\n\nSo I think it's ok.\n\nSo minimal H=6.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: S\n\nNow, in the box.\n\nBut the answer should be in the format.\n\nAlso, the player position: at (0,4) turn 9.\n\nAfter U, to (0,5) turn 10.\n\nThen U to (0,6) turn 11, etc., to (0,9) turn 14.\n\nAnd no collision.\n\nSo I think that's the answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 4)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 9\\) is 6. The sequence of actions is designed to avoid collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by moving upward consistently, as all intermediate positions are safe at the respective turns.\n\n- At turn 9, the player is at \\((0, 4)\\).

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,5) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible without colliding with any cars. The vertical position y ranges from 0 to 9, and I start at y=5. The cars are on freeways y=1 to y=8, and each freeway has one or more cars moving left or right with given speeds.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the car movements. The cars move continuously, and I collide only if at some turn T, I'm on a freeway y_T and 0 is within the span of a car on that freeway at that turn.\n\nThe player position updates at each turn based on the action: U for up (y increases by 1), D for down (y decreases by 1), S for stay (y stays the same). y must stay between 0 and 9, so I can't go below 0 or above 9.\n\nThe goal is to reach y=9.\n\nCurrent turn is t_1 = 10, and I'm at (0,5).\n\nNow, let's list all the cars and their positions at turn t=10.\n\nFor each car, the span is given as (head, tail, direction, speed). Direction: right means it's moving right, so as time increases, the position increases. Left means moving left, position decreases.\n\nThe update rule: for left-moving cars, span at time T is [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]? Let's read carefully.\n\nIt says:\n\nLeft-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nBut for left-moving, if it's moving left, head and tail should both decrease.\n\nSimilarly, right-moving: [Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]? That seems inconsistent.\n\nLook: for right-moving, it says Span(t_1) = [τ, h], which might be a typo? Probably it should be [head, tail] for both, but direction indicates how it moves.\n\nIn the input, for each car, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nFor example, freeway 1: (48, 1, right, 48)\n\nSince direction is right, and it's moving right, so head and tail both increase with time.\n\nIn the span notation, for right-moving, it says Span(t_1) = [τ, h], which might be a mistake or perhaps it's listed as (tail, head) or something? No, it says (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nLet's read the car state table:\n\nFor freeway 1: Cars: (48, 1, right, 48)\n\nSo head=48, tail=1, direction=right, speed=48.\n\nFor right-moving cars, the span at time T is [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]? But τ and h are given.\n\nFrom the update rule:\n\nRight-moving: Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nBut in the input, it's given as (head, tail), so for right-moving, Span(t_1) is [tail, head] or [head, tail]?\n\nThere's inconsistency in notation.\n\nLook: in the update rule, for right-moving, it says \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h]\" but in input, it's (head, tail), so probably τ is tail, h is head.\n\nSo for a car, head and tail are given, with head being the front if moving, I think.\n\nFor direction right, the car is moving to the right, so at time t_1, head is at position, say, and tail at lower position.\n\nSimilarly for left.\n\nIn the span, it's a interval on the x-axis, I assume, but since we're only concerned with x=0, we care when the span includes 0.\n\nFor collision, at turn T, if y_T = k, and for some car on freeway k, 0 is in Span(T).\n\nSpan(T) is the interval at time T.\n\nNow for the update:\n\nFor left-moving car: at t_1, span is [h, τ]? But it says Span(t_1) = [h, τ] for left-moving.\n\nFrom text: \"Left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\"\n\nSo for left-moving, at t_1, the span is from h to τ, and since moving left, both decrease.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving: \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\"\n\nSo for right-moving, at t_1, span is from τ to h, with τ < h, I assume, and both increase.\n\nIn the input, for each car, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nSo for right-moving, head is the front, so at t_1, position of head is higher than tail, so span is [tail, head].\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, head is front, so if moving left, head is at left or right? If moving left, the front is towards left, so at t_1, head position is less than tail position? This is confusing.\n\nLet's define clearly.\n\nAssume that for a car, the head is the front in the direction of motion.\n\nSo for a car moving right, head is at the right end, tail at left, so at t_1, head position > tail position, span is [tail, head].\n\nFor a car moving left, head is at the left end, tail at right, so at t_1, head position < tail position, span is [head, tail] but since head < tail, the interval is from min to max, but in the span, it's the occupied positions.\n\nIn the update rule, for left-moving, it says Span(t_1) = [h, τ], and h and τ are positions, with h and τ, and for left-moving, since moving left, h decreases, τ decreases.\n\nBut in the input, for left-moving cars, what are head and tail?\n\nLook at the data.\n\nFor example, freeway 6: (-48, -25, left, 24)\n\nDirection left, so head should be the left end.\n\nAt t_1, head = -48, tail = -25, so since moving left, head is smaller, tail is larger, so span is from head to tail, [ -48, -25 ].\n\nThen at time T, since moving left, both positions decrease, so Span(T) = [ -48 - s(T-t_1), -25 - s(T-t_1) ]\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving, freeway 2: (-24, -35, right, 4)\n\nDirection right, so head should be the right end? But -24 > -35, so if moving right, head at -24, tail at -35, so span from tail to head, [-35, -24]? But in the update rule, for right-moving, Span(t_1) = [τ, h], so τ is tail, h is head.\n\nIn this case, tail = -35, head = -24, so Span(t_1) = [-35, -24], and at T, [ -35 + s(T-t_1), -24 + s(T-t_1) ]\n\nSimilarly, another car on freeway 2: (52, 41, right, 4), so tail=41, head=52? 41 to 52, tail=41, head=52, so [41,52] at t_1.\n\nAnd (16,5,right,4), tail=5, head=16, span [5,16].\n\nFor left-moving, like freeway 6: (-48,-25,left,24), head=-48, tail=-25, span [ -48, -25] at t_1.\n\nFreeway 8: (-24,11,left,36), head=-24, tail=11, so span [ -24,11] at t_1, but since moving left, head decreases, tail decreases.\n\nNow, we care about when 0 is in the span for a given freeway at a given time.\n\nThe player is at (0, y_t), so at turn t, y_t is the row, and we check if for that row, at time t, 0 is in some car's span.\n\nNow, the note says: if at turn T, I move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T, then at turn T, I am on y_T, so I only check for cars on y_T at time T. When I move, at the end of the turn, I update position, so during the turn, I am on the starting freeway.\n\nThe note: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_{T} at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nSo at turn T, after action, I am at y_{T+1}, but for collision at turn T, I am on y_T during the turn, so we check cars on y_T at time T.\n\nSimilarly, at turn T, when I am about to act, I am at y_T, and after action, I go to y_{T+1}, but the collision is checked based on where I am during the turn, which is y_T for the entire turn, I think.\n\nThe collision occurs at turn T only if at that turn, I am on a freeway and 0 is in the car span for that freeway at that exact turn.\n\nSo for each turn, we need to ensure that for the y_t I am on, no car on that row has 0 in its span at time t.\n\nNow time t is discrete, turns.\n\nt_1 = 10 is the current turn, and I start at turn t_1, position y_{t_1} = 5.\n\nAfter action a_{t_1}, I go to y_{t_1 +1}, and so on.\n\nThe sequence of actions from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, so after H actions, at time t_1 + H, I am at y_{t_1 + H}, and we want y_{t_1 + H} = 9, but the position after H actions is at time t_1 + H.\n\nLet's see: we have actions for t from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, so after k actions, at time t_1 + k.\n\nWe start at time t_1, position given.\n\nAfter action a_{t_1}, at time t_1 +1, position y_{t_1 +1}, and so on, up to after action a_{t_1 + H -1}, at time t_1 + H, position y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nAnd we need min H such that we reach y=9 at time t_1 + H.\n\nAnd for each time from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, when we are at y_t, it must be safe, meaning no collision on that freeway at that time.\n\nAt time t, before action, we are at y_t, and we perform action to go to y_{t+1}, but for collision at time t, we are on y_t.\n\nSimilarly at time t_1 + H, we are at y=9, and since we reached, we don't care about collision at that time if we don't stay, but we only care during the journey up to when we arrive.\n\nThe collision is checked at each turn t from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, because at those turns, we are on some y_t and might collide.\n\nAt time t_1 + H, we have reached, so no action, no collision check needed, I think.\n\nThe problem says: \"reach (0,9)\", and \"collision occurs at turn T only if...\", so during the turns when we are moving, from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, we need to avoid collision at each of those turns.\n\nAt time t_1 + H, we are at y=9, and if we stop, no issue, but we don't perform an action at t_1 + H, since actions up to t_1 + H -1.\n\nThe sequence is actions for t = t_1 to t_1 + H -1, so at time t_1 + H, position is set, but no action, so no collision check for time t_1 + H, I believe. Only for times when we are present during the turn with action.\n\nLet's see the definition.\n\n\"Collision occurs at turn T\" — turn T is when we perform action or are present.\n\nFrom the note, it seems that at each turn T, we are on a freeway and we check for that turn.\n\nBut when we reach at time t_1 + H, we are at y=9, and if there is a car at that time, it might collide, but since we don't have an action for that turn, perhaps we don't care, or do we?\n\nThe problem says: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions to reach (0,9)\", and \"collision occurs at turn T only if 0 in Span(T) for car on freeway y_T\".\n\nNow, for the arrival turn, if at time t_1 + H, y_{t_1 + H} =9, and there is a car on freeway 9 at that time with 0 in span, do we collide? But freeway 9 is not a thing, freeways are y=1 to 8, y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, so no cars there, so it's always safe at y=0 and y=9.\n\nLet's confirm: \"freeways y=1,…,8\", so y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, no cars, so we are safe when on y=0 or y=9.\n\nTherefore, to reach (0,9), once we are at y=9, we are safe, no collision possible.\n\nSimilarly at y=0.\n\nSo we only need to worry about y=1 to 8 during the journey.\n\nNow, we start at y=5 at time t_1=10.\n\nWe need to go to y=9, which is 4 steps up, but we can go down or stay, but to minimize turns, we should go up as much as possible, but we have to avoid the cars.\n\nFirst, let's list for each freeway and each future time, whether x=0 is occupied by a car at that time.\n\nTime is in turns, starting from t=10.\n\nFor a given freeway k and time T (relative to t_1=10, so T=0 for t=10, T=1 for t=11, etc., but let's use absolute time.\n\nSet t_1=10 as reference.\n\nFor time t >=10.\n\nFor each freeway, and for each car on it, we can compute when 0 is in Span(t).\n\nThen for freeway k, at time t, it is occupied at x=0 if for some car, 0 in [min, max] of the span at that time.\n\nThen for player, at time t, if on freeway k, it must not be occupied at that time.\n\nNow, let's list all cars.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: only one car: (48,1,right,48)\n\nAt t_1=10, span [τ, h] = [1,48] since right-moving, tail=1, head=48.\n\nGeneral: for right-moving car, at time t, span [τ + s(t-10), h + s(t-10)]\n\nHere tail τ=1, head h=48, speed s=48.\n\nSo span at time t: [1 + 48(t-10), 48 + 48(t-10)]\n\n0 is in this span if 1 + 48(t-10) <= 0 <= 48 + 48(t-10)\n\nSince the car is moving right, and at t=10, span [1,48], which is all positive, so 0 not in.\n\nAs t increases, the left end increases, so 0 never in span for t>=10, since min position is 1 at t=10 and increasing.\n\nSimilarly, for left end: at t=10, left=1, increasing, so always >0, so 0 never occupied for freeway 1.\n\nSo freeway 1 is always safe at x=0 for t>=10.\n\nNow freeway 2: three cars.\n\nFirst car: (-24,-35,right,4)\n\nRight-moving, so at t_1=10, span [τ, h] = [-35,-24]? tail τ=-35, head h=-24.\n\nSpeed s=4.\n\nSpan at time t: [τ + s(t-10), h + s(t-10)] = [-35 + 4(t-10), -24 + 4(t-10)]\n\n0 in span if -35 + 4(t-10) <= 0 <= -24 + 4(t-10)\n\nLet u = t-10, time offset.\n\nSo -35 + 4u <= 0 and 0 <= -24 + 4u\n\nFirst inequality: -35 + 4u <= 0 => 4u <= 35 => u <= 35/4 = 8.75\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= -24 + 4u => 4u >= 24 => u >= 6\n\nSo for u=6 to u=8, since u integer, t=16,17,18? u= t-10, so t=16,17,18.\n\nu=6: t=16, span [-35+24, -24+24] = [-11,0], so 0 <= 0 is true, and -11 <=0, so 0 in span.\n\nu=7: t=17, [-35+28, -24+28] = [-7,4], 0 in.\n\nu=8: t=18, [-35+32, -24+32] = [-3,8], 0 in.\n\nu=8.75, but u integer, t=16,17,18.\n\nu=6,7,8: t=16,17,18.\n\nNow second car on freeway 2: (52,41,right,4)\n\nHead=52, tail=41, direction right, so span at t_1=10: [41,52]\n\nAt time t: [41 + 4(t-10), 52 + 4(t-10)]\n\nMin at t=10 is 41>0, increasing, so 0 never in span.\n\nThird car: (16,5,right,4)\n\nHead=16, tail=5, so [5,16] at t=10, [5+4u,16+4u] with u=t-10, all positive, min 5>0, so 0 never in.\n\nSo for freeway 2, occupied only when t=16,17,18.\n\nNow freeway 3: two cars.\n\nFirst: (48,37,right,12)\n\nRight-moving, head=48, tail=37, so [37,48] at t=10, [37+12u,48+12u], min 37>0, increasing, 0 never in.\n\nSecond car: (0,-11,right,12)\n\nHead=0, tail=-11, direction right.\n\nSpan at t_1=10: [τ, h] = [-11,0]\n\nAt time t: [-11 + 12(t-10), 0 + 12(t-10)] = [-11 +12u, 12u] with u=t-10\n\n0 in span if -11 +12u <= 0 <= 12u\n\nFirst: -11+12u <=0 => 12u <=11 => u <= 11/12 <1, so u=0 only? u=0: t=10, -11 <=0<=0, 0<=0 true, so 0 in span.\n\nu=0: t=10, span [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nu=1: t=11, span [-11+12,12] = [1,12], 0 not in, since min=1>0.\n\nSo only at t=10, occupied.\n\nNow freeway 4: same as freeway 3? Cars: (48,37,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12)\n\nIdentical to freeway 3.\n\nSo for freeway 4, occupied at t=10 only, by the second car.\n\nt=10, span [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nNow freeway 5: two cars.\n\nFirst: (12,1,right,6)\n\nHead=12, tail=1, right, so [1,12] at t=10, [1+6u,12+6u], min=1>0 at u=0, increasing, 0 never in.\n\nSecond: (60,49,right,6)\n\n[49,60] at t=10, [49+6u,60+6u], min=49>0, 0 never in.\n\nSo freeway 5 always safe.\n\nNow freeway 6: one car: (-48,-25,left,24)\n\nLeft-moving, direction left.\n\nFor left-moving, at t_1=10, span [h, τ] = [-48,-25], head=-48, tail=-25.\n\nSpeed s=24.\n\nAt time t: [h - s(t-10), τ - s(t-10)] = [-48 -24u, -25 -24u] with u=t-10\n\n0 in span if -48 -24u <= 0 <= -25 -24u\n\nSince the car is moving left, positions decreasing.\n\nFirst inequality: -48 -24u <= 0 => -24u <= 48 => u >= -2, but u>=0, always true for u>=0? -48 -24u <=0, so -24u <=48, divide by -24, reverse inequality, u >= -2, since u>=0, true.\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= -25 -24u => 0 <= -25 -24u, which is -25 -24u >=0? 0 <= -25 -24u implies -25 -24u >=0, so -24u >=25, u <= -25/24, negative, impossible.\n\n0 <= -25 -24u? Since -25-24u is negative for u>=0, 0 <= negative is false.\n\nSo never true. 0 is not >= -25-24u because right side is negative.\n\n0 in [min,max] requires min <= 0 <= max.\n\nHere min = -48-24u, max = -25-24u.\n\nFor u>=0, min <= -48 <0, max <= -25<0, so both negative, 0 > max, so 0 not <= max, so 0 not in span.\n\nThus freeway 6 never occupied at x=0.\n\nBut let's confirm: at u=0, span [-48,-25], 0 not in. As u increases, both decrease, more negative, so 0 never in.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 7: same as freeway 6? Cars: (-48,-25,left,24) identical, so same, never occupied.\n\nNow freeway 8: one car: (-24,11,left,36)\n\nDirection left, head=-24, tail=11.\n\nAt t_1=10, span [h, τ] = [-24,11]\n\nAt time t: [h - s(t-10), τ - s(t-10)] = [-24 -36u, 11 -36u] with u=t-10\n\n0 in span if -24 -36u <= 0 <= 11 -36u\n\nFirst inequality: -24 -36u <= 0 => -36u <= 24 => u >= -24/36 = -2/3, true for u>=0.\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= 11 -36u => 36u <= 11 => u <= 11/36 ≈ 0.305\n\nu integer, so u=0 only.\n\nu=0: t=10, 0 <= 11 true, and -24 <=0, so 0 in span.\n\nFor u=0, min=-24<=0, max=11>=0, so yes.\n\nu=1: t=11, min=-24-36=-60, max=11-36=-25, both negative, 0 not in.\n\nSo only at t=10, occupied.\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway, times when x=0 is occupied (unsafe):\n\ny=1: always safe (no car covers 0)\n\ny=2: unsafe at t=16,17,18\n\ny=3: unsafe at t=10\n\ny=4: unsafe at t=10\n\ny=5: always safe\n\ny=6: always safe (freeway 6, no)\n\ny=7: always safe\n\ny=8: unsafe at t=10\n\ny=5 is freeway 5, which we said always safe.\n\ny=6 freeway 6, always safe.\n\ny=7 same.\n\ny=8 unsafe at t=10.\n\nNow, player starts at t=10, y=5.\n\nAt t=10, y=5 is safe, as per above.\n\nBut we need to move from here.\n\nThe goal is to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nSince we start at y=5, need to go to y=9, which is 4 steps up.\n\nBut we can move slower or faster, and avoid unsafe times.\n\nMinimal H: if we go directly up, actions U,U,U,U, then at time t=10, we are at y=5, safe.\n\nAfter first U, at t=11, y=6, safe.\n\nAfter second U, t=12, y=7, safe.\n\nAfter third U, t=13, y=8.\n\nNow at t=13, y=8.\n\nBut y=8 is unsafe only at t=10, which is past, so at t=13, should be safe.\n\nAfter fourth U, t=14, y=9, reached.\n\nNow, check for collision during the moves.\n\nAt t=10: y=5, freeway 5, safe, as established.\n\nAction a_{10} = U\n\nAt t=11: position y=6, freeway 6, which is always safe, no issue.\n\nAction a_{11} = U\n\nAt t=12: y=7, freeway 7, always safe.\n\nAction a_{12} = U\n\nAt t=13: y=8, freeway 8. Now, at t=13, is freeway 8 occupied?\n\nFreeway 8 unsafe only at t=10, at t=13, u=3, span min=-24-36*3=-24-108=-132, max=11-108=-97, both negative, not covering 0, so safe.\n\nAction a_{13} = U\n\nAt t=14: y=9, reached, no freeway, safe.\n\nSo we reach at t=14, with H=4 actions: U,U,U,U from t=10 to t=13.\n\nBut is t=14 the time? Let's see.\n\nStart: t=10, y=5\n\nAfter a_{10}=U, t=11, y=6\n\nAfter a_{11}=U, t=12, y=7\n\nAfter a_{12}=U, t=13, y=8\n\nAfter a_{13}=U, t=14, y=9\n\nYes, at t=14, y=9.\n\nNumber of actions: from t=10 to t=13, 4 actions, H=4.\n\nBut is there any problem?\n\ny=2 has unsafe times at t=16,17,18, but we don't go to y=2, so no issue.\n\ny=3 and y=4 unsafe at t=10, but we are not on them at t=10.\n\nIn this path, we only touch y=5,6,7,8, all safe at the times we are on them.\n\nSpecifically, at t=10, y=5 safe; t=11, y=6 safe; t=12, y=7 safe; t=13, y=8 safe.\n\nThen at t=14, y=9.\n\nSo seems fine.\n\nBut the car on y=8 at t=10 is unsafe, but we are on y=8 at t=13, which is fine.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nBut is there a reason to go slower? No, since we can go fast.\n\nBut let's confirm the car positions.\n\nFor example, freeway 8 at t=13: u=3, span [-24-108,11-108] = [-132,-97], not cover 0.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), and we do in 4 turns.\n\nBut perhaps I missed something.\n\nAnother thing: on freeway 2, it is unsafe at t=16,17,18, but we don't use it.\n\nBut in this case, we go directly up from 5 to 6 to 7 to 8 to 9.\n\ny=5 to 9, with steps.\n\nBut y=8 is a freeway, and we are on it at t=13.\n\nBut it is safe.\n\nPerhaps we can go faster? But we start at y=5, need to reach y=9, so min 4 steps up, so H=4 seems minimal.\n\nCan we reach in less? For example, if we could jump, but no, only +1, -1, 0 per turn.\n\nSo min H=4.\n\nBut in the actions, we have four actions.\n\nBut let's see if at some point it is blocked.\n\nAnother thing: when we move, for example, at t=10, we are on y=5, safe, we move up to y=6 at t=11.\n\nAt t=11, we are on y=6, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly all.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's list the unsafe times for each row:\n\ny=1: always safe\n\ny=2: unsafe t=16,17,18\n\ny=3: unsafe t=10\n\ny=4: unsafe t=10\n\ny=5: always safe\n\ny=6: always safe\n\ny=7: always safe\n\ny=8: unsafe t=10\n\nNow, we need to be on some y from 1 to 8 during turns, but since we start at y=5 and go up, we avoid the unsafe times.\n\nFor example, if we were to go to y=3 or y=4, we need to avoid t=10, but t=10 is the start, so at t=10, if we were on y=3 or y=4, it would be unsafe, but we start at y=5.\n\nSimilarly, y=8 unsafe at t=10, but we are on it later.\n\nIn our path, no issue.\n\nPerhaps we can go even faster, but we can't, since min 4 steps.\n\nUnless we start from y=5, but we need to reach y=9.\n\nAnother thought: we can go down, but that would take more turns, not minimal.\n\nFor example, if we go down to y=4, but at t=10 y=4 is unsafe, so we cannot be on y=4 at t=10, and later y=4 might be safe, but going down and up would take more turns.\n\nSimilarly, not necessary.\n\nSo H=4 seems achievable.\n\nBut in the answer, we need to output the actions.\n\nBut let's confirm the times.\n\nCurrent turn t_1=10.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{10} = U\n\nThen at t=11, y=6\n\nTurn t_1+1: a_{11} = U? t_1+1 is t=11.\n\nThe sequence: actions from t=10 to t=13 for H=4.\n\nIn the answer format: Turn t_1: a_{t_1}, which is a_{10}\n\nTurn t_1 +1: a_{11}\n\n...\n\nUp to Turn t_1 + H-1: a_{t_1 + H-1}\n\nHere H=4, so actions at t=10,11,12,13.\n\nAfter that, at t=14, position y=9.\n\nSo actions: all U.\n\nBut is there a problem with freeway 3 or something? No.\n\nPerhaps I misread the car on freeway 3.\n\nFreeway 3 at t=10: car (0,-11,right,12), span [-11,0] at t=10, so 0 included, so if on y=3 at t=10, collide, but we are not.\n\nSimilarly for y=4.\n\nIn our case, fine.\n\nBut let's see if we can reach faster? No.\n\nPerhaps we can reach in H=3? But from y=5 to y=9, min 4 steps, impossible in 3, since each action changes y by at most 1.\n\nSo H=4 is minimal.\n\nTherefore, the sequence should be four U actions.\n\nBut the player position: we start at (0,5) at turn t_1=10.\n\nAfter action U at t=10, position at t=11 is (0,6)\n\nAfter U at t=11, at t=12 (0,7)\n\nAfter U at t=12, at t=13 (0,8)\n\nAfter U at t=13, at t=14 (0,9)\n\nAnd all safe.\n\nBut just to be sure, let's check freeway 8 at t=13.\n\nFreeway 8 car: (-24,11,left,36)\n\nAt t=13, u=3, span: [-24 -36*3, 11 -36*3] = [-24-108, 11-108] = [-132, -97], not include 0.\n\nSimilarly, no other cars on y=8.\n\nAnd y=5,6,7 always safe.\n\nSo should be fine.\n\nBut in the car list, freeway 2 has cars, but we don't go there.\n\nAnother thing: on freeway 5, it has cars, but we said always safe, since no car covers 0.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n\nBut the problem says \"avoid collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to 8\", and we are on y=5,6,7,8 at times when they are safe.\n\nPerhaps output the actions.\n\nBut in the answer, it should be for turns starting from t_1.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nAnd that's it.\n\nBut H=4, and we reach at t=14.\n\nNow, the answer format: we need to box it.\n\nBut let's see if there is any constraint I missed.\n\nThe note about moving: when we move, at turn T, we are on y_T during the turn, and we move to y_{T+1} after.\n\nBut in this case, no issue.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 8, at t=10 it is unsafe, but we are not on it until t=13, which is fine.\n\nAnother point: the car on freeway 3 and 4 at t=10, but we are on y=5.\n\nSo I think it's okay.\n\nPerhaps we need to consider if we stay or something, but no need.\n\nSo minimal H is 4.\n\nBut let's list the unsafe times again to confirm.\n\nFreeway 1: safe all t\n\nFreeway 2: unsafe t=16,17,18\n\nFreeway 3: unsafe t=10\n\nFreeway 4: unsafe t=10\n\nFreeway 5: safe all t\n\nFreeway 6: safe all t\n\nFreeway 7: safe all t\n\nFreeway 8: unsafe t=10\n\nNow, our path:\n\nt=10: y=5, safe\n\nt=11: y=6, safe\n\nt=12: y=7, safe\n\nt=13: y=8, safe (since unsafe only at t=10)\n\nt=14: y=9, safe\n\nAll good.\n\nIf we tried to go through y=4, for example, at t=10 y=4 unsafe, so we cannot be on y=4 at t=10. If we go to y=4 later, say at t=11, but y=4: is it safe at t=11?\n\nFor freeway 4, cars: (48,37,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12)\n\nAt t=11, u=1, first car [37+12,48+12]=[49,60], not cover 0.\n\nSecond car: [-11+12, 0+12] = [1,12], not cover 0.\n\nSimilarly, at all t>10, freeway 4 safe, since at t=10 only unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3 same.\n\nBut in our case, no need, since we can go directly.\n\nIf we start by staying or down, it would take more turns.\n\nFor example, if at t=10 we do S, then at t=11 still y=5, but then we need to go up, so more turns.\n\nSimilarly, not minimal.\n\nSo H=4 with all U is best.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is:\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nIn the answer, it should be in the box.\n\nBut the turn is t_1=10, so:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} = U\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1} = U\n\nTurn t_1 + 2: a_{t_1 + 2} = U\n\nTurn t_1 + 3: a_{t_1 + 3} = U\n\nAnd H=4.\n\nNow, to write in the format.\n\nSo the minimal number of turns H is 4, and the actions as above.\n\nBut in the output, it says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\", but in the answer format, it only shows the actions, not H explicitly, I think.\n\nThe answer format is:\n\n\\boxed{ Turn t_1: a_{t_1} Turn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1} ... }\n\nWith the actions.\n\nAnd since H is the number of actions, it is implied by the sequence.\n\nSo for this, four lines.\n\nNow, I think that's it.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's check freeway 2 at t=16,17,18 unsafe, but since we are not on y=2, no issue.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nPerhaps the player can go to other rows, but not necessary.\n\nSo I think correct.\n</think>\nThe goal is to reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 5) at turn \\(t_1 = 10\\) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis of Car Occupancy at \\(x = 0\\)\n- **Freeway 1**: Always safe (no car covers \\(x = 0\\) for \\(t \\geq 10\\)).\n- **Freeway 2**: Unsafe at \\(t = 16, 17, 18\\) due to the car \\((-24, -35, \\text{right}, 4)\\).\n- **Freeway 3**: Unsafe at \\(t = 10\\) due to the car \\((0, -11, \\text{right}, 12)\\); safe for \\(t > 10\\).\n- **Freeway 4**: Unsafe at \\(t = 10\\) due to the car \\((0, -11, \\text{right}, 12)\\); safe for \\(t > 10\\).\n- **Freeway 5**: Always safe (no car covers \\(x = 0\\) for \\(t \\geq 10\\)).\n- **Freeway 6**: Always safe (no car covers \\(x = 0\\) for \\(t \\geq 10\\)).\n- **Freeway 7**: Always safe (no car covers \\(x = 0\\) for \\(t \\geq 10\\)).\n- **Freeway 8**: Unsafe at \\(t = 10\\) due to the car \\((-24, 11, \\text{left}, 36)\\); safe for \\(t > 10\\).\n\n### Path to Reach \\(y = 9\\) Minimally\n- The player starts at \\(y = 5\\) at \\(t = 10\\).\n- To reach \\(y = 9\\), a minimum of 4 upward moves (U) are required, as each action changes \\(y\\) by at most \\(\\pm 1\\).\n- The direct upward path through \\(y = 6, 7, 8\\) to \\(y = 9\\) is feasible and avoids all unsafe times:\n  - At \\(t = 10\\), \\(y = 5\\) (safe, as freeway 5 is always safe).\n  - At \\(t = 11\\), \\(y = 6\\) (safe, as freeway 6 is always safe).\n  - At \\(t = 12\\), \\(y = 7\\) (safe, as freeway 7 is always safe).\n  - At \\(t = 13\\), \\(y = 8\\) (safe, as freeway 8 is unsafe only at \\(t = 10\\), so safe at \\(t = 13\\)).\n  - At \\(t = 14\\), \\(y = 9\\) (reached, and \\(y = 9\\) has no freeway, so safe).\n- This path uses \\(H = 4\\) actions (turns \\(t = 10\\) to \\(t = 13\\)) and reaches \\(y = 9\\) at \\(t = 14\\).\n- No shorter path is possible, as \\(H = 4\\) is the minimum number of actions to increase \\(y\\) from 5 to 9.\n\n### Action Sequence\n- Actions are all U (up) to move directly upward without delay.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 10: U \\\\\nTurn 11: U \\\\\nTurn 12: U \\\\\nTurn 13: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to get from (0,6) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t1 = 11, and I start at y=6.\n\nThe player moves up, down, or stays each turn, changing y by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9. So I can only move to adjacent rows or stay put.\n\nCollisions happen only if at turn T, I'm on a freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there's a car where 0 is in its span at that exact turn. Importantly, when I move to a new row, I'm not on that row until the next turn. So if I move from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T I'm still on y, and at T+1 I'm on y+1. So I don't check for collisions on the new row until I'm there.\n\nThe goal is to reach (0,9), so y=9.\n\nNow, let's list all the cars and their positions at turn t1=11.\n\nFor each car, given head h, tail τ, direction d, and speed s, the span at time t is:\n\n- If left-moving (d=left), span(T) = [h - s*(T - t1), τ - s*(T - t1)]\n\n- If right-moving (d=right), span(T) = [τ + s*(T - t1), h + s*(T - t1)]\n\nSince t1=11, for any future turn T, Δt = T - t1 = T - 11.\n\nCollision if y_T = k and for some car on freeway k, 0 ∈ span(T).\n\ny_T is the row I'm on at turn T.\n\nI need to find a sequence of actions to go from y=6 at t=11 to y=9 at some turn H later.\n\nMinimize H, the number of turns, so I want to do it as fast as possible, probably by moving up as much as I can, but I have to avoid the cars.\n\nFirst, let's compute the car positions for each freeway at t=11, and then for future turns.\n\nt1=11.\n\nFreeway 1: cars: (96,49,right,48)\n\nSince right-moving, at T, span = [τ + s*(T-11), h + s*(T-11)] = [49 + 48*(T-11), 96 + 48*(T-11)]\n\nBut we care about when 0 is in this span.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: three cars.\n\nFirst car: (-20,-31,right,4) so span(T) = [-31 + 4*(T-11), -20 + 4*(T-11)]\n\nSecond car: (56,45,right,4) span(T) = [45 + 4*(T-11), 56 + 4*(T-11)]\n\nThird car: (20,9,right,4) span(T) = [9 + 4*(T-11), 20 + 4*(T-11)]\n\nFreeway 3: (60,49,right,12) and (12,1,right,12)\n\nFirst: [49 + 12*(T-11), 60 + 12*(T-11)]\n\nSecond: [1 + 12*(T-11), 12 + 12*(T-11)]\n\nFreeway 4: same as freeway 3? It says (60,49,right,12) and (12,1,right,12), identical to freeway 3. But different freeway, so separate.\n\nFreeway 5: (18,7,right,6) and (-48,-59,right,6)\n\nFirst: [7 + 6*(T-11), 18 + 6*(T-11)]\n\nSecond: [-59 + 6*(T-11), -48 + 6*(T-11)]\n\nFreeway 6: (-72,-49,left,24)\n\nLeft-moving, so span(T) = [h - s*(T-11), τ - s*(T-11)] = [-72 - 24*(T-11), -49 - 24*(T-11)]\n\nFreeway 7: same as 6? (-72,-49,left,24) identical.\n\nFreeway 8: (-60,-25,left,36) so span(T) = [-60 - 36*(T-11), -25 - 36*(T-11)]\n\nNow, for collision, we need 0 in the span for that freeway at turn T.\n\nSince I start at y=6, and want to go to y=9, I need to move up to y=7, then y=8, then y=9.\n\nBut y=7 and y=8 have cars, so I need to be careful when I'm on those rows.\n\nI also might need to stay or move down to avoid, but moving down might not help since I need to go up eventually.\n\nSince H is minimized, I should move up as soon as possible unless blocked.\n\nBut let's find when each freeway has a car at position 0.\n\nFor a given freeway k, at turn T, if there is a car with 0 in its span, then if I'm on k at turn T, I collide.\n\nOtherwise, no collision.\n\nSo for each freeway, I need to find for which T, 0 is in some car's span on that row.\n\nThen, when I plan to be on a row at turn T, it must not be a collision time for that row.\n\nSince I move one step per turn, I can only change row by one each turn.\n\nStart at t=11, y=6.\n\nAt t=11, I'm on y=6. Is there a collision at t=11 on y=6?\n\nFreeway 6 is y=6? Freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=6 is freeway 6.\n\nFreeway k is at row k, I think.\n\nThe freeway is the row, so freeway 1 is y=1, freeway 2 is y=2, ..., freeway 8 is y=8.\n\nPlayer on (0, y_t), so y_t is the row.\n\nAt turn T, if y_T = k, and for freeway k, 0 in span at T, then collision.\n\nNow, at t=11, y=6, so on freeway 6.\n\nFreeway 6 has one car: (-72,-49,left,24)\n\nAt T=11, Δt=0, span = [-72 -0, -49 -0] = [-72, -49], which is all negative, 0 not in [-72,-49], so no collision at t=11 on y=6.\n\nGood.\n\nNow, I need to go to y=9.\n\ny=9 is not a freeway, freeways are 1 to 8, so y=9 has no cars, so once I reach y=9, no collision possible. But I need to be on y=9 at some turn.\n\nThe goal is to reach (0,9), so when y_t =9 for some t, and I'm at (0,9).\n\nBut at that turn, if y_t=9, no freeway, so no collision. So as soon as I'm on y=9, I'm safe.\n\nBut I need to get there from y=6, passing through y=7 and y=8, which have freeways.\n\ny=7 is freeway 7, y=8 is freeway 8.\n\nI start at y=6, t=11.\n\nI can choose to move up (U), down (D), or stay (S) each turn.\n\nIf I move up, next turn y=7; if stay, y=6; if down, y=5, but y=5 is freeway 5, which might have cars, and going down might not help since I need to go up, so probably not down, unless necessary to avoid something.\n\nSimilarly, staying might be needed to wait.\n\nBut to minimize H, I should avoid unnecessary stays or downs.\n\nH is the number of turns from start to when I reach y=9.\n\nSuppose I move up at every turn: from t=11, y=6, if U, then t=12, y=7; t=13, y=8; t=14, y=9. So H=3 turns, actions at t=11,12,13.\n\nBut I need to check if I collide on y=7 or y=8 during these turns.\n\nAt t=12, if I'm on y=7, need to check freeway 7 at t=12.\n\nAt t=13, on y=8, check freeway 8 at t=13.\n\nAlso, at t=11, I'm on y=6, which we saw no collision.\n\nNow, freeway 7: one car (-72,-49,left,24)\n\nAt turn T, span = [h - s*(T-11), τ - s*(T-11)] = [-72 -24*(T-11), -49 -24*(T-11)]\n\n0 in span when -72 -24*(T-11) <= 0 <= -49 -24*(T-11)\n\nSince left-moving, the span is decreasing.\n\nSet L(T) = -72 -24*(T-11)\n\nU(T) = -49 -24*(T-11)  // upper and lower bounds\n\n0 in [L(T), U(T)] if L(T) <= 0 <= U(T)\n\nBut L(T) = -72 -24Δt\n\nU(T) = -49 -24Δt, with Δt = T-11\n\nSince both are negative and decreasing, U(T) < L(T) < 0 for all T, because -49 > -72, so U(T) > L(T), but both negative.\n\nL(T) = -72 -24Δt <= -72 < 0\n\nU(T) = -49 -24Δt <= -49 < 0\n\nSo for all T, L(T) <= U(T) < 0, so 0 > U(T) >= L(T), so 0 not <= U(T), thus 0 never in [L(T), U(T)] for any T.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 6, at t=11, L= -72, U= -49, both neg.\n\nAt other T, more negative.\n\nSo for freeway 7, the car span is always negative, never reaches 0, so no collision possible on freeway 7 at any time.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6: same car? Freeway 6 has (-72,-49,left,24), same as freeway 7? No, freeway 6 has one car, freeway 7 has another identical car? From the table:\n\nFreeway 6: (-72,-49,left,24)\n\nFreeway 7: (-72,-49,left,24) same parameters, but different freeway, so separate.\n\nBut for each, since span always negative, no collision on y=6 or y=7 ever, because the cars are far left and moving left, so position decreasing from negative, never to 0.\n\ny=6 and y=7 are safe at all times.\n\nNow freeway 8: y=8, car (-60,-25,left,36)\n\nLeft-moving, so span(T) = [h - s*(T-11), τ - s*(T-11)] = [-60 -36*(T-11), -25 -36*(T-11)]\n\nSet L(T) = -60 -36*Δt\n\nU(T) = -25 -36*Δt, Δt = T-11\n\n0 in [L(T), U(T)] if L(T) <= 0 <= U(T)\n\nL(T) <= 0 <= U(T)\n\nSince U(T) = -25 -36*Δt < 0 for all Δt >=0, because -25 <0 and subtracting more.\n\nSimilarly L(T) <0.\n\nU(T) is always negative, so 0 <= U(T) is false for all T, since U(T) <0.\n\nTherefore, 0 never in the span, so no collision on freeway 8 at any time.\n\nIs that right?\n\nU(T) = -25 -36*Δt <= -25 <0, so yes, U(T) <0 for all T, so 0 > U(T), so 0 not <= U(T), thus never in span.\n\nSimilarly for other freeways with negative positions.\n\nBut let's check freeway 2, for example, which has cars that might be near 0.\n\nFreeway 2 has three cars.\n\nFirst car: (-20,-31,right,4) so at T, span = [ -31 +4*(T-11), -20 +4*(T-11) ]\n\nSet Δt = T-11\n\nSpan low: -31 +4Δt\n\nSpan high: -20 +4Δt\n\n0 in span if -31 +4Δt <= 0 <= -20 +4Δt\n\nWhich means 4Δt <= 31 and 4Δt >=20? Let's solve inequalities.\n\nFirst inequality: -31 +4Δt <= 0 => 4Δt <= 31 => Δt <= 31/4 = 7.75\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= -20 +4Δt => 4Δt >=20 => Δt >=5\n\nSo for Δt between 5 and 7.75, inclusive? Δt integer, since turns.\n\nΔt = T-11, T integer.\n\nSo Δt >=5 and Δt <=7\n\nΔt=5: low = -31 +20 = -11, high= -20+20=0, so [ -11, 0], 0 is included, since <= high.\n\n0 <= high, and low <=0.\n\nAt high=0, 0 <=0 is true.\n\nSimilarly, Δt=6: low=-31+24= -7, high=-20+24=4, [ -7,4], 0 in.\n\nΔt=7: low=-31+28= -3, high=-20+28=8, [ -3,8], 0 in.\n\nΔt=8: low=-31+32=1, high=-20+32=12, [1,12], 0 not in, since 1>0.\n\nΔt=4: low=-31+16= -15, high=-20+16= -4, [-15,-4], both neg, 0 not in.\n\nSo for first car on freeway 2, collision when Δt=5,6,7, i.e., T=16,17,18.\n\nT=11 + Δt, so T=16,17,18.\n\nNow second car on freeway 2: (56,45,right,4) span = [45+4Δt, 56+4Δt]\n\nBoth positive for Δt>=0, since min 45>0, so 0 not in [45+4Δt,56+4Δt], always positive.\n\nThird car: (20,9,right,4) span = [9+4Δt, 20+4Δt], always positive for Δt>=0, so 0 never in span.\n\nSo only the first car on freeway 2 causes collision at T=16,17,18.\n\nThat is, at turn 16,17,18, if on freeway 2, collision possible only from first car.\n\nBut freeway 2 is y=2, so only if I'm on y=2 at those turns.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways.\n\nBut I'm starting from y=6, going to y=9, so y=2 is not on my path, probably irrelevant.\n\nSimilarly, let's check freeway 1.\n\nFreeway 1: (96,49,right,48) span = [49+48Δt, 96+48Δt], always positive, so no collision ever on y=1.\n\nFreeway 3: two cars.\n\nFirst: (60,49,right,12) span = [49+12Δt, 60+12Δt] always positive.\n\nSecond: (12,1,right,12) span = [1+12Δt, 12+12Δt] always positive for Δt>=0, since min 1>0? At Δt=0, [1,12], 0 not in; Δt>0, larger, so no collision on y=3.\n\nSimilarly freeway 4: same as 3, no collision.\n\nFreeway 5: two cars.\n\nFirst: (18,7,right,6) span = [7+6Δt, 18+6Δt] always positive, min 7>0.\n\nSecond: (-48,-59,right,6) span = [-59+6Δt, -48+6Δt]\n\n0 in span if -59+6Δt <=0 <= -48+6Δt\n\nFirst: -59+6Δt <=0 => 6Δt <=59 => Δt <= 59/6 ≈9.833\n\nSecond: 0 <= -48+6Δt => 6Δt >=48 => Δt >=8\n\nSo Δt from 8 to 9 inclusive.\n\nΔt=8: low= -59+48= -11, high= -48+48=0, [ -11,0], 0 in.\n\nΔt=9: low= -59+54= -5, high= -48+54=6, [ -5,6], 0 in.\n\nΔt=10: low= -59+60=1, high= -48+60=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo collision on freeway 5 at T=11+8=19 and T=11+9=20, i.e., turn 19 and 20.\n\nBut only if on y=5 at that time.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6,7,8 we saw no collision ever.\n\nFreeway 6 and 7 have cars far left, always negative, no issue.\n\nFreeway 8 also always negative.\n\nNow, the only possible collisions are on y=2 at T=16,17,18 and on y=5 at T=19,20.\n\nBut I'm at y=6, going to y=9, so y=2 and y=5 are below, I don't need to go there, so I can avoid those rows entirely.\n\nSince I'm starting at y=6, and y=6,7,8 are all safe at all times, as we established.\n\ny=6: freeway 6, no collision ever.\n\ny=7: freeway 7, no collision ever.\n\ny=8: freeway 8, no collision ever.\n\nAnd y=9 no freeway.\n\nSo I can just move up directly: at t=11, move U to y=7 at t=12.\n\nAt t=12, on y=7, no collision.\n\nThen at t=12, move U to y=8 at t=13.\n\nAt t=13, on y=8, no collision.\n\nThen at t=13, move U to y=9 at t=14.\n\nAt t=14, on y=9, goal reached.\n\nH=3 turns: actions at t=11,12,13.\n\nBut let's confirm the turns.\n\nStart at t=11, y=6.\n\nAfter action at t=11, y_{t+1} depends on a_t.\n\nThe player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with Δy_t based on a_t.\n\nAt turn t, I choose a_t, then y_{t+1} is set.\n\nPosition at turn t is given before action, I think.\n\nThe position at turn t is (0, y_t), then I choose a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nIn the collision, at turn T, I am at y_T, and if on freeway k=y_T, and 0 in span at T.\n\nFor example, at t=11, I am at y=6, before any action.\n\nI choose a_{t1} = a_{11}, which affects y_{12}.\n\nThen at t=12, I am at y_{12}, which is set based on a_{11}.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nIn this case, to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nIf I move up at each turn:\n\nt=11: choose a_{11}, say U, then y_{12} = 6 +1 =7\n\nAt t=12, I am on y=7. Since freeway 7 has no car at 0 ever, no collision.\n\nThen at t=12, choose a_{12}=U, then y_{13} =7+1=8\n\nAt t=13, on y=8, freeway 8 no issue.\n\nThen at t=13, choose a_{13}=U, then y_{14}=8+1=9\n\nAt t=14, on y=9, no freeway, done.\n\nSo in 3 turns, I reach y=9 at t=14.\n\nH is the number of turns, from t=11 to t=11+H-1, I think.\n\nThe sequence is actions from t=0 to H-1 relative to t1, so t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nIn this case, actions at t=11,12,13 for H=3.\n\nAnd I reach at t=14.\n\nBut at t=14, y=9, which is the goal.\n\nNow, is there any reason I cannot do this? y=7 and y=8 are safe at all times, including t=12 and t=13.\n\nSimilarly, at t=11, y=6 safe.\n\nSo this should be fine.\n\nBut let me double-check if for y=7 or y=8, there is any car that could be at 0.\n\nFreeway 7: car at (-72,-49,left,24), at T, position span [ -72 -24Δt, -49 -24Δt], for Δt= T-11.\n\nAt T=12, Δt=1, span [ -72-24, -49-24] = [-96,-73], all neg.\n\nT=13, [-120,-97], etc., never 0.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8: (-60,-25,left,36), at T=12, Δt=1, [ -60-36, -25-36] = [-96,-61]\n\nT=13, [-132,-97], all neg, no 0.\n\nFreeway 6 same.\n\nAnd other freeways not relevant.\n\nBut freeway 5 has collisions at T=19,20, but I'm not on y=5.\n\nSimilarly y=2 at T=16-18, not on it.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 3, with actions U, U, U.\n\nBut the answer should be in the format.\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} etc.\n\nt1=11.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nAnd I reach y=9 at turn 14.\n\nBut let me confirm the turn numbering.\n\nAt turn t=11, position (0,6)\n\nAfter a_{11}=U, y_{12} = 7\n\nAt turn t=12, position (0,7)\n\nAfter a_{12}=U, y_{13}=8\n\nAt turn t=13, position (0,8)\n\nAfter a_{13}=U, y_{14}=9\n\nAt turn t=14, position (0,9), done.\n\nCollisions: at each turn, when on freeway, but as above, no collisions.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if I need to stay or something, but no need.\n\nMaybe for y=8, but it's safe.\n\nAnother thing: the car update, but since no cars on y=7,8 ever have 0 in span, it's fine.\n\nPerhaps I misread freeway 8.\n\nFreeway 8: (-60,-25,left,36)\n\nDirection left, so head is at -60, tail at -25? Head and tail.\n\nIn the span, for left-moving, head is left, I think.\n\nIn the car update:\n\nLeft-moving: span(t1) = [h, τ] then span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nAnd since moving left, h is the leftmost? Not necessarily.\n\nIn the initial: for left-moving, at t1, head h, tail τ, with h and τ, but which is left?\n\nIn the example, freeway 6: (-72,-49,left,24), and span at t1 is [h, τ] = [-72, -49], so since left-moving, and -72 < -49, so head is at -72, which is left, tail at -49 right.\n\nThen moving left, both decrease.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving, span at t1 is [τ, h], so for freeway 2 first car: (-20,-31,right,4), but span at t1 is [τ, h] = [-31, -20], so τ is tail, h is head, so for right-moving, tail left, head right.\n\nIn this case, τ=-31, h=-20, so tail at -31, head at -20.\n\nThen moving right, both increase.\n\nBut in any case, for freeway 8, left-moving, h=-60, τ=-25, so at t1, span [ -60, -25], since h=-60 < τ=-25? -60 < -25, so left is -60, right is -25.\n\nThen moving left, positions decrease.\n\nAt T, span [ -60 -36Δt, -25 -36Δt], which for Δt>=0, all values less than or equal to -25, so negative, never 0.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo yes.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 3 with actions U,U,U.\n\nBut the problem says \"avoid collisions with cars on freeways y=1,...,8\", and since y=6,7,8 are freeways but no collision possible, it's fine.\n\nPerhaps I should output the sequence.\n\nSo for t1=11.\n\nAnswer:\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nIn the format.\n\nBut let me see if H can be less? From y=6 to y=9, minimum 3 moves up, so H=3 is minimum possible, since each move changes y by at most 1.\n\nIf I could jump, but no, only ±1 or 0, so min 3 actions.\n\nAnd since no obstacles, I can do it.\n\nBut is y=9 reachable directly? No, must go through 7 and 8.\n\nBut they are safe.\n\nPerhaps at the exact turns, but no issue.\n\nAnother thing: when I move to a new row, I am not on that row until next turn, but in this case, since I check collision at the current turn position, and I move to new position only after.\n\nIn this path, at t=11, y=6, safe.\n\na11=U, go to y=7 at t=12.\n\nAt t=12, y=7, safe.\n\na12=U, go to y=8 at t=13.\n\nAt t=13, y=8, safe.\n\na13=U, go to y=9 at t=14.\n\nAt t=14, y=9, no freeway, done.\n\nNo collision at any point.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 5 or others, but I'm not on them.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nBut in the car state, freeway 4 is same as 3, but not relevant.\n\nFreeway 5 has cars, but I'm not on y=5.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo the minimal H is 3.\n\nBut the problem is to box the answer.\n\nSo actions: at turn 11: U, turn 12: U, turn 13: U.\n\nIn the sequence.\n\nPerhaps I need to specify until I reach.\n\nBut H=3, actions at t=11,12,13.\n\nIn the answer format.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 11: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: U \\end{array} } or something.\n\nBut let me write it as text.\n\nSince it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nBut in the box.\n\nPerhaps I should confirm if at t=13, when I am on y=8, is there any issue, but no.\n\nAnother thought: the car on freeway 8, but it's not at 0.\n\nPerhaps I misread the direction.\n\nFreeway 8: (-60,-25,left,36)\n\nleft, so moving left, away from 0.\n\nSimilarly, all cars on y=6,7,8 are moving away or static but not near 0.\n\ny=6 and 7 have cars moving left, decreasing.\n\nSo no.\n\nTherefore, it should be straightforward.\n\nSo the minimal number of turns is 3, with the sequence above.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 6) at turn \\(t_1 = 11\\) and aims to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis:\n- The freeways \\(y = 6\\), \\(y = 7\\), and \\(y = 8\\) (corresponding to freeways 6, 7, and 8) have no collisions at any turn because the car spans on these freeways are always negative or positive but never contain 0:\n  - Freeway 6: Car at (-72, -49, left, 24) has span \\([-72 - 24\\Delta t, -49 - 24\\Delta t]\\) for \\(\\Delta t = T - 11\\). Since both bounds are negative for all \\(T\\), 0 is never in the span.\n  - Freeway 7: Car at (-72, -49, left, 24) has the same span as freeway 6, so 0 is never in the span.\n  - Freeway 8: Car at (-60, -25, left, 36) has span \\([-60 - 36\\Delta t, -25 - 36\\Delta t]\\). The upper bound is always negative, so 0 is never in the span.\n- Freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 5\\) have potential collisions at specific turns, but since the player starts at \\(y = 6\\) and moves upward to \\(y = 9\\), these freeways are not visited and thus irrelevant.\n- The minimum number of turns to move from \\(y = 6\\) to \\(y = 9\\) is 3, as each move changes \\(y\\) by at most 1.\n- The sequence of actions to move directly upward is feasible without collisions:\n  - At turn 11, move up to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 12. At turn 12, \\(y = 7\\) is collision-free.\n  - At turn 12, move up to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 13. At turn 13, \\(y = 8\\) is collision-free.\n  - At turn 13, move up to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 14. \\(y = 9\\) has no freeway, so no collision is possible.\n\n### Solution:\n- Minimal \\(H = 3\\) turns (actions at turns 11, 12, and 13).\n- Sequence of actions:\n  - Turn 11: Move up (\\(U\\)) to reach \\(y = 7\\) at turn 12.\n  - Turn 12: Move up (\\(U\\)) to reach \\(y = 8\\) at turn 13.\n  - Turn 13: Move up (\\(U\\)) to reach \\(y = 9\\) at turn 14.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 11: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: \\, U \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,7) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible without colliding with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The player moves up, down, or stays, changing y by +1, -1, or 0 each turn, and y must stay between 0 and 9. Collision happens only if at some turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T and for that freeway, there's a car where 0 is in its span at that exact turn.\n\nThe car spans move left or right based on their direction and speed. Left-moving cars decrease their position over time, right-moving increase.\n\nCurrent turn is t_1 = 12. Player at y=7.\n\nI need to go from y=7 to y=9, so I need to move up twice. But I have to avoid the freeways when cars are at position 0.\n\nThe freeways are y=1 to 8, and I start at y=7, which is a freeway. y=9 is not a freeway; it's the goal, so no cars there.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, I think, since no freeways there. The freeways are only from 1 to 8.\n\nNow, the cars: for each freeway, there are cars with head, tail, direction, speed.\n\nI need to find when each car has 0 in its span at turn T for T >= t_1 = 12.\n\nLet me denote the current turn as t=12.\n\nFor each car, the span at time T is:\n\nFor right-moving: span(T) = [tau + s*(T-12), h + s*(T-12)] since at T=12, span is [tau, h], and it moves right, so positions increase.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving: at T=12, span is [h, tau], but since it's left-moving, positions decrease, so span(T) = [h - s*(T-12), tau - s*(T-12)]\n\nAnd collision if 0 is in [low, high] for that car at time T.\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need to find for which T, 0 is in the span of some car on that freeway.\n\nBut since multiple cars per freeway, I need to check all cars on a row for when 0 is occupied at time T.\n\nAlso, since the player is on y at turn T, and if y is a freeway (1-8), and if at that turn, 0 is occupied, collision.\n\nBut if the player moves to a different y, they are not on the new y until the next turn? Let me read carefully.\n\n\"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd y_T is the player's position at turn T.\n\nAlso, from the note: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_{T} at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nSo at turn T, you are only on y_T, so only check cars on y_T for that turn.\n\nWhen you move, during the turn you are on the starting y, and after the move, you are on the new y for the next turn.\n\nSo for collision at turn T, it's based on y_T, the position at the start of turn T, and we check cars on that row y_T at time T.\n\nThen after action, y_{T+1} is set.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=7 at t=12 to y=9 at some turn.\n\nSince I need to reach (0,9), and y=9 is safe, no cars, so once I'm on y=9, I'm done, I don't need to do anything else, but I have to be at y=9 at the end of some turn.\n\nThe sequence should end when y_{t1+H-1} =9, so at turn t1+H-1, position is 9.\n\nNow, minimal H, so probably move up as fast as possible, but avoid collisions.\n\nCurrent y=7, need to go to y=8 or y=9? From 7, I can go to 8, then to 9.\n\nBut y=8 is a freeway, so I need to be on y=8 only when no car has 0 in span at that turn.\n\nSimilarly for y=7, I start on it at t=12, so I need to ensure that at t=12, on y=7, no collision. I assume the initial position is safe, or do I need to check?\n\nThe problem says \"avoid collisions\", so I think I need to make sure that at t=12, if on freeway, it's safe. But since it's given as current state, probably it's safe at start, but let me confirm.\n\nIt says \"current turn is t1\", and player position, so I think at t1, it's given, and we start from there, so no collision at t1, I assume.\n\nSimilarly, for other times, we need to avoid.\n\nBut to be safe, I should check if at t=12, on y=7, is there a car with 0 in span.\n\nLet me list all cars and when 0 is occupied for each freeway.\n\nFirst, let's list all freeways with cars.\n\nFreeway k=1: y=1, one car: (-48, -95, right, 48)\n\nDirection right, so at time T, span = [tau + s*(T-12), h + s*(T-12)]\n\ntau = -95, h = -48, s=48? Head and tail: for right-moving, head is the front, so at t=12, span [tau, h] = [-95, -48], I think.\n\nThe notation: \"Cars (head h, tail tau, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nAnd for right-moving, span at t1 is [tau, h], and it moves right.\n\nSimilarly for left, span at t1 is [h, tau], moves left.\n\nSo for freeway 1, car: head h=-48, tail tau=-95, d=right, s=48.\n\nSo at t=12, span = [tau, h] = [-95, -48]\n\nAt time T, span = [tau + s*(T-12), h + s*(T-12)] = [-95 + 48*(T-12), -48 + 48*(T-12)]\n\n0 is in span if low <= 0 <= high, so -95 + 48*(T-12) <= 0 <= -48 + 48*(T-12)\n\nSet delta = T-12, so for delta >=0.\n\n-95 + 48 delta <= 0 <= -48 + 48 delta\n\nFirst inequality: -95 + 48 delta <= 0 => 48 delta <= 95 => delta <= 95/48 ≈ 1.979\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= -48 + 48 delta => 48 delta >= 48 => delta >=1\n\nSo for delta >=1 and delta <= 1.979, so delta=1, since delta integer, T-12=1, T=13.\n\ndelta=1: -95 +48= -47 <=0? -47 <=0 true, 0 <= -48+48=0, 0<=0 true, so yes.\n\ndelta=2: -95 +96=1 <=0? 1<=0 false, and 0<= -48+96=48, true but first false, so not.\n\ndelta=0: -95 +0 = -95 <=0 true, 0 <= -48 +0 = -48? 0 <= -48 false.\n\nSo only at T=13, 0 is in span for freeway 1.\n\nBut freeway 1 is y=1, we are on y=7, so not relevant for now, but good to know.\n\nNow freeway 2: y=2, three cars.\n\nFirst car: (-16, -27, right, 4)\n\nAt T, span = [tau + s delta, h + s delta] = [-27 + 4 delta, -16 + 4 delta]\n\n0 in span if -27 +4 delta <=0 <= -16 +4 delta\n\nFirst: -27 +4d <=0 => 4d <=27 => d <= 27/4=6.75\n\nSecond: 0 <= -16 +4d => 4d >=16 => d>=4\n\nSo d from 4 to 6, inclusive? d=4,5,6.\n\nd=4: low=-27+16= -11 <=0, high=-16+16=0, 0<=0 true.\n\nd=5: low=-27+20=-7<=0, high=-16+20=4, 0<=4 true.\n\nd=6: low=-27+24=-3<=0, high=-16+24=8, 0<=8 true.\n\nd=3: low=-27+12=-15<=0 true, high=-16+12=-4, 0<= -4 false.\n\nd=7: low=-27+28=1<=0 false.\n\nSo T=12+d, so T=16,17,18? d=4,5,6 → T=16,17,18.\n\nT=12 + delta, delta=T-12.\n\ndelta=4, T=16; delta=5,T=17; delta=6,T=18.\n\nBut this is for first car.\n\nNow second car on y=2: (60,49, right,4)\n\nHead h=60, tail tau=49? For right-moving, span at t1 is [tau, h] = [49,60]\n\nDirection right, speed 4.\n\nAt T, [49 +4 delta, 60 +4 delta]\n\n0 in span? 49 +4d <=0 <=60+4d? But 49+4d >=49>0 for d>=0, so low >=49>0, so 0 cannot be <= low, so never occupied. 0 < 49 <= low, so not in span. Similarly, always positive, so no issue.\n\nThird car: (24,13, right,4)\n\nSpan at t1: [13,24]? [tau, h] = [13,24]\n\nAt T: [13+4 delta, 24+4 delta] >=13>0, so never 0, no collision.\n\nSo for freeway 2, only the first car matters, and it occupies 0 at T=16,17,18.\n\nT=16,17,18.\n\nNow freeway 3: y=3\n\nCars: (-48, -59, right, 12) and (24,13, right,12)\n\nFirst car: head h=-48, tail tau=-59, right, s=12\n\nSpan at t1: [tau, h] = [-59, -48]\n\nAt T: [-59 +12 delta, -48 +12 delta]\n\n0 in span: -59 +12d <=0 <= -48 +12d\n\nFirst: -59+12d <=0 => 12d <=59 => d <= 59/12≈4.916\n\nSecond: 0 <= -48+12d => 12d >=48 => d>=4\n\nSo d=4,5? d=4: low=-59+48= -11<=0, high=-48+48=0, 0<=0 true\n\nd=5: low=-59+60=1<=0? 1<=0 false, high=-48+60=12>0, but low=1>0, so 0 not <= low? low=1, 0<1, so 0 not >= low? span is [low,high], so for 0 to be in, low <=0<=high.\n\nd=5: low=1 <=0? false, so not.\n\nd=4: low=-11<=0, high=0<=0 true.\n\nd=3: low=-59+36=-23<=0, high=-48+36=-12, 0<= -12 false.\n\nSo only at d=4, T=12+4=16.\n\nSecond car: (24,13, right,12), span [13,24] at t1, at T [13+12d,24+12d] >0, never 0.\n\nSo freeway 3 occupied only at T=16.\n\nNow freeway 4: y=4\n\nCars: (-48, -59, right, 12) and (24,13, right,12) same as freeway 3? Exactly the same?\n\nFirst car: (-48, -59, right,12) same as above, so at T=16, occupied.\n\nSecond car: (24,13,right,12) never 0.\n\nSo freeway 4 occupied at T=16.\n\nNow freeway 5: y=5\n\nCars: (24,13, right,6) and (-42,-53, right,6)\n\nFirst car: (24,13, right,6) head h=24, tail tau=13? [tau,h]=[13,24] at t1.\n\nAt T: [13+6d,24+6d] >0, never 0.\n\nSecond car: (-42,-53, right,6) head h=-42, tail tau=-53, d=right.\n\nSpan at t1: [tau,h] = [-53,-42]\n\nAt T: [-53 +6d, -42 +6d]\n\n0 in span: -53+6d <=0 <= -42+6d\n\nFirst: -53+6d <=0 => 6d <=53 => d <= 53/6 ≈8.833\n\nSecond: 0 <= -42+6d => 6d >=42 => d>=7\n\nSo d=7,8\n\nd=7: low=-53+42= -11<=0, high=-42+42=0, 0<=0 true\n\nd=8: low=-53+48= -5<=0, high=-42+48=6, 0<=6 true\n\nd=6: low=-53+36= -17<=0 true, high=-42+36= -6, 0<= -6 false\n\nd=9: low=-53+54=1<=0 false\n\nSo T=12+7=19 and T=12+8=20.\n\nT=19 and 20.\n\nNow freeway 6: y=6\n\nCar: (48,71, left,24) direction left.\n\nFor left-moving, span at t1 is [h, tau]? Head h=48, tail tau=71? But left-moving, so head is left? The notation: for left-moving, \"Span(t1) = [h, tau]\" and it moves left.\n\nIn the car update: \"Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, tau] → Span(T) = [h - s (T-t1), tau - s (T-t1)]\"\n\nSo here h=48, tau=71, s=24, left-moving.\n\nAt t1, span [48,71]\n\nAt T, [48 - 24 delta, 71 - 24 delta]\n\n0 in span: 48 -24d <=0 <=71 -24d\n\nFirst inequality: 48 -24d <=0 => -24d <= -48 => d >=2 (since divide by negative)\n\n48 -24d <=0 => 24d >=48 => d>=2\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <=71 -24d => 24d <=71 => d <= 71/24 ≈2.958\n\nSo d>=2 and d<=2.958, so d=2, since integer.\n\nd=2: low=48-48=0 <=0, high=71-48=23, 0<=23 true.\n\nd=3: low=48-72=-24<=0 true, high=71-72=-1, 0<= -1 false.\n\nd=1: low=48-24=24<=0? false.\n\nSo only at d=2, T=14.\n\nT=12+2=14.\n\nNow freeway 7: y=7, we are on it at t=12.\n\nCars: (48,71, left,24) same as above? Head 48, tail 71, left, s=24, same as freeway 6.\n\nSo for y=7, car: (48,71, left,24)\n\nSimilarly, at T, span [48 -24 delta, 71 -24 delta]\n\n0 in span: same as above, only at d=2, T=14.\n\nBut at T=14, 0 is occupied on y=7.\n\nNow, we are at y=7 at t=12, and we need to check if at t=12, it is safe.\n\nAt t=12, delta=0, span [48,71], 0 not in [48,71], since 48>0, so safe.\n\nAt t=13, delta=1, span [48-24=24, 71-24=47], both >0, 0 not in.\n\nAt t=14, delta=2, span [0,23], 0 in, so occupied.\n\nSo at turn T=14, if player is on y=7, collision.\n\nBut we start at t=12 on y=7, safe.\n\nNow freeway 8: y=8\n\nCar: (48,83, left,36) head 48, tail 83, left, s=36.\n\nAt T, span [48 -36 delta, 83 -36 delta]\n\n0 in span: 48-36d <=0 <=83-36d\n\nFirst: 48-36d <=0 => 36d >=48 => d >= 48/36=4/3≈1.333, so d>=2 since integer? d>=2.\n\n36d >=48, d>=48/36=4/3=1.333, so d>=2.\n\nSecond: 0 <=83-36d => 36d <=83 => d <= 83/36≈2.305\n\nSo d=2 only.\n\nd=2: low=48-72= -24? 48 - 36*2 = 48-72= -24 <=0 true, high=83-72=11, 0<=11 true.\n\nd=3: low=48-108= -60<=0, high=83-108= -25, 0<= -25 false.\n\nd=1: low=48-36=12<=0? false.\n\nSo only at T=12+2=14, occupied.\n\nT=14.\n\nNow, also, for y=6, we have at T=14 occupied.\n\ny=7 at T=14 occupied.\n\ny=8 at T=14 occupied.\n\ny=8 also at T=14.\n\nNow, other times? Let's summarize the dangerous times for each freeway.\n\ny=1: occupied at T=13\n\ny=2: occupied at T=16,17,18\n\ny=3: occupied at T=16\n\ny=4: occupied at T=16\n\ny=5: occupied at T=19,20\n\ny=6: occupied at T=14\n\ny=7: occupied at T=14\n\ny=8: occupied at T=14\n\nAnd y=0 and y=9 safe always.\n\nWe start at t=12, y=7, safe.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\ny=9 is safe, but to get there, we need to pass through y=8 at some point.\n\nPossible actions: U, D, S.\n\nSince we need to go up, and minimal turns, probably we want to go up as much as possible.\n\nBut we have to avoid being on freeways when occupied.\n\nSpecifically, for y=7, it is occupied only at T=14, so at t=14, if we are on y=7, collision.\n\nSimilarly, y=8 occupied at t=14.\n\ny=6 also occupied at t=14.\n\nNow, at t=12, we are on y=7.\n\nWe need to choose actions for t=12, t=13, etc.\n\nLet me denote the turn and position.\n\nAt turn T, position y_T.\n\nStart: T=12, y=7.\n\nNow, for T=12, we are safe.\n\nNow, we can choose action a_{12}: U, D, or S.\n\nIf U, then y_{13} = 8\n\nIf D, y_{13}=6\n\nIf S, y_{13}=7\n\nBut we need to go to 9, so D is down, which is away, probably not helpful, but might be to avoid, but since we need min turns, likely not necessary.\n\nSimilarly, S stays, which delays.\n\nSo probably U is best, but let's see.\n\nFirst, if we go up at t=12: a_{12}=U, then y_{13}=8\n\nAt T=13, we are on y=8.\n\nNow, is y=8 safe at T=13?\n\nFrom above, y=8 occupied only at T=14, not at T=13.\n\nAt T=13, for y=8: delta=T-12=1\n\nCar: span [48 -36*1, 83-36*1] = [12, 47], all positive, 0 not in, so safe.\n\nThen at T=13, we are on y=8, safe.\n\nNow, we can choose action a_{13}.\n\nIf we go U, y_{14}=9, done in two turns? T=13 to y=9.\n\nBut at T=14, we would be on y=9, but y=9 is not freeway, so no collision, and we are at (0,9).\n\nSequence: t=12: U to y=8\n\nt=13: U to y=9\n\nThen at turn t=13, we are at y=9? Let's see the turns.\n\nAt start of turn t=12, y=7.\n\nAfter action a_{12}, at start of turn t=13, y_{13} is set.\n\nSimilarly, after a_{13}, at start of turn t=14, y_{14} is set.\n\nWe want y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nt1=12, so at some turn T, y_T=9.\n\nIn this case, if we do a_{12}=U, then y_{13}=8\n\nThen a_{13}=U, then y_{14}=9\n\nSo at turn t=14, y=9, so we reached at T=14, which is t1 + 2, since 12+2=14, H=2? Turns: t=12 and t=13 actions, H=2 turns.\n\nt from t1 to t1+H-1, so for H=2, turns t=12 and t=13, and y_{13} after action, but position at start of turn.\n\nAt start of turn t=12: y=7\n\nAfter a_{12}, position for t=13 is y=8\n\nAt start of turn t=13: y=8\n\nAfter a_{13}, position for t=14 is y=9\n\nAt start of turn t=14: y=9, which is the goal.\n\nAnd we need to check for each turn when we are on freeway, no collision.\n\nAt t=12: y=7, freeway, but as we saw, safe.\n\nAt t=13: y=8, freeway, at T=13, we checked, safe.\n\nAt t=14: y=9, not freeway, so no issue.\n\nNow, is there any problem? But at t=14, on y=9, not freeway, fine.\n\nBut what about the action sequence: for turn t=12, action U; turn t=13, action U.\n\nThen we reach at t=14.\n\nBut H is the number of turns, so sequence from t=12 to t=12+H-1.\n\nFor H=2, actions at t=12 and t=13.\n\nBut at t=13, we take action to go to y=9, so at t=14 start, y=9.\n\nIn the sequence, we have actions for t=12 and t=13.\n\nBut let's confirm if at t=13 on y=8 is safe.\n\nT=13, delta=1, y=8 car: as above, span [48-36, 83-36] = [12,47], 0 not in, yes.\n\nSimilarly, no other issues.\n\nBut y=7 is occupied at t=14, but we are not on it at t=14.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nSo with two moves, we can reach.\n\nBut is there a reason we cannot? For example, if we had to avoid something.\n\nAt t=13, we are on y=8, which is safe.\n\nThen to y=9.\n\nBut y=9 not freeway.\n\nPerhaps we need to consider if moving to y=9 at t=13 action, but at t=13 we are on y=8, and action U to y=9.\n\nThen at t=14, we are on y=9.\n\nAll seems fine.\n\nBut let's see if there is any constraint I missed.\n\nThe player can only move to adjacent y or stay, so from 8 to 9 is fine.\n\nPerhaps for other freeways, but since we are not on them, no issue.\n\nBut what about y=7 at t=14 occupied, but we are not there.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut let me list all dangerous times again.\n\ny=1: T=13\n\ny=2: T=16,17,18\n\ny=3: T=16\n\ny=4: T=16\n\ny=5: T=19,20\n\ny=6: T=14\n\ny=7: T=14\n\ny=8: T=14\n\nAt T=13, y=1 is occupied, but we are not on y=1.\n\nAt T=14, y=6,7,8 are all occupied, so we must not be on them at T=14.\n\nIn our plan, at T=14, we are on y=9, safe.\n\nAt T=13, we are on y=8, which is safe as above.\n\nAt T=12, y=7 safe.\n\nSo it seems fine with two moves: a12=U, a13=U.\n\nBut is y=8 safe at T=13?\n\ny=8 car: at T=13, delta=1, span [48-36,83-36]=[12,47], 12 to 47, all positive, 0 not in, yes.\n\nSimilarly, no other cars on y=8.\n\nSo should be ok.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), which we do at T=14.\n\nBut let's see if we can do in one move? From y=7 to y=9? But we can only change by +1,0,-1, so cannot jump directly. So min two moves: first to y=8, then to y=9.\n\nWith S or D, it would take more turns.\n\nSo H=2 should be minimal.\n\nBut is there a problem at T=13 on y=8?\n\nPerhaps I should check if at T=13, for y=8, is there any car?\n\nOnly one car, which we have.\n\nBut let me confirm the car positions.\n\nFreeway 8: car (48,83, left,36)\n\nAt T=13, delta=1, position: since left-moving, span [h - s delta, tau - s delta] = [48 - 36*1, 83 - 36*1] = [12, 47]\n\nYes, 12 to 47, min 12>0, so 0 not in [12,47], safe.\n\nSimilarly, if we do S at t=12, stay at y=7, then at t=13, y=7, which is safe? At T=13, y=7 car: delta=1, span [48-24,71-24]=[24,47], 24 to 47, 0 not in, safe.\n\nBut then at t=13, if we go U, to y=8, but at T=14, if we are on y=8, but y=8 occupied at T=14.\n\nProblem: if we stay at t=12, S, then at t=13, y=7, then at t=13 action U, then y_{14}=8.\n\nBut at start of turn t=14, y=8, and T=14, which is occupied for y=8, collision.\n\nIf we go U at t=12 to y=8 at t=13, then at t=13 action U to y=9 at t=14, so at t=14 we are on y=9, not on freeway.\n\nBut if we delay, we might be on y=8 at t=14, which is bad.\n\nIn our first plan, we avoid being on freeways at t=14.\n\nAnother option: go down to y=6? But that would take more turns.\n\nFor example, at t=12, D to y=6 at t=13.\n\nAt t=13, y=6, which is freeway, need to check safety.\n\nAt T=13, y=6 car: delta=1, span [48-24,71-24]=[24,47], 0 not in, safe.\n\nThen at t=13, if U, to y=7 at t=14.\n\nBut at t=14, y=7, which is occupied, collision.\n\nIf S at t=13, stay y=6, but at t=14, y=6 occupied, collision.\n\nIf D to y=5 at t=14, but y=5 might be safe at t=14? y=5 occupied at T=19,20, not at t=14.\n\nAt T=14, delta=2, y=5 cars.\n\nFirst car: (24,13,right,6) never occupied.\n\nSecond car: (-42,-53,right,6) at T=14, delta=2, span [-53+12, -42+12]=[-41,-30]? [-53 +6*2, -42+6*2]= [-53+12, -42+12]= [-41,-30], both negative, 0 not in.\n\nSo y=5 safe at T=14.\n\nBut if we go to y=5 at t=14, we are farther from goal.\n\nThen need to come back up, which takes more turns.\n\nNot efficient.\n\nSimilarly, other paths.\n\nSo the direct up-up seems best.\n\nBut in our case, with a12=U, a13=U, we are at y=8 at t=13 and y=9 at t=14.\n\nAt t=13 on y=8, safe; at t=14 on y=9, safe.\n\nNo collision.\n\nPerhaps we can do it in one action? But cannot, since from 7 to 9 not possible directly.\n\nSo H=2.\n\nBut the answer should be the sequence.\n\nBut let me see the car on freeway 2 or others, but not relevant.\n\nPerhaps at t=13, y=1 is occupied, but we are not on it.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nBut in the car list, for freeway 2, at T=16,17,18 occupied, but we are done by then.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo minimal H=2, actions: turn t_12: U, turn t_13: U\n\nIn the answer format.\n\nBut the sequence is for t from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nt1=12, H=2, so turns t=12 and t=13.\n\nActions: a_{t1} = a_{12} = U, a_{t1+1} = a_{13} = U\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let me write.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\"\n\nIn this case, H=2.\n\nBut is there a way with H=1? No, because from y=7, cannot reach y=9 in one action.\n\nAction changes y by at most 1.\n\nSo min H=2.\n\nPerhaps with stay or down, but that would be H>2.\n\nSo yes.\n\nBut just to be thorough, suppose we do S at t=12, then at t=13 y=7, then we need to go to y=8 or something.\n\nBut at t=13, y=7 is safe, as span [24,47] for delta=1.\n\nThen if U at t=13, y_{14}=8, but at t=14 y=8 occupied, collision.\n\nIf S at t=13, stay y=7, then at t=14 y=7 occupied, collision.\n\nIf D at t=13 to y=6, but at t=14 y=6 occupied, collision.\n\nSo only if we can avoid being on freeways at t=14.\n\nFor example, from t=13 y=7, if we go U, we go to y=8 at t=14, which is bad.\n\nIf we go D to y=6 at t=14, bad.\n\nBut if we go to y=5 at t=14, which is safe, as we saw.\n\nThen from y=5 at t=14, we can go up later.\n\nBut that takes more turns.\n\nFor instance: t=12: S, then at t=13 y=7\n\nThen t=13: D? To y=6 at t=14? But y=6 occupied at t=14.\n\nTo go to y=5 at t=14, from y=7 at t=13, action D, then y_{14}=6? Action at t=13: if D, y_{14} = y_{13} -1 = 7-1=6.\n\nBut y=6 at t=14 occupied.\n\nTo go to y=5, from y=7, we need to go down twice? But at t=13, from y=7, if we go D, we go to y=6 at t=14, which is occupied.\n\nWe cannot go directly to y=5.\n\nSo at t=13, from y=7, actions: U to y=8, D to y=6, S to y=7.\n\nAll lead to being on freeway at t=14: y=8,6,7 all occupied at t=14.\n\nSo if we are at y=7 at t=13, we cannot avoid collision at t=14 if we take any action, because next position will be on a freeway occupied.\n\nBut in our initial plan, we are not at y=7 at t=13; we are at y=8.\n\nAt t=13, we are at y=8, which is safe, and we go to y=9.\n\nIf we start with D at t=12 to y=6 at t=13.\n\nThen at t=13, y=6, which at T=13 is safe, span [24,47] for delta=1.\n\nThen at t=13, we need to choose action.\n\nIf U, to y=7 at t=14, but y=7 occupied.\n\nIf D, to y=5 at t=14, y=5 is safe at t=14, as we saw.\n\nThen at t=14, y=5, safe.\n\nThen from there, we need to go up to y=9, which takes at least 4 more actions: to y=6,7,8,9.\n\nBut we have to avoid dangerous times.\n\nFor example, y=6 occupied at t=14, but we are not on it at t=14; we are on y=5.\n\nThen at t=14, we can go U to y=6 at t=15.\n\nBut at t=15, y=6, is it safe?\n\ny=6 car: at T=15, delta=3, span [48-72,71-72]=[-24,-1], all negative, 0 not in, so safe? [h - s delta, tau - s delta] = [48-24*3, 71-24*3] = [48-72,71-72]= [-24,-1], -24 to -1, 0 not in, since -1<0, so safe.\n\nThen from y=6 at t=15, we can go U to y=7 at t=16.\n\nBut at t=16, y=7, is it safe?\n\ny=7 car: at T=16, delta=4, span [48-96,71-96]=[-48,-25], negative, 0 not in, safe.\n\nBut also, at t=16, other freeways might be occupied, but y=7 is safe.\n\ny=7 occupied only at t=14, not at t=16.\n\nSimilarly, then go to y=8 at t=17.\n\ny=8 at t=17: delta=5, span [48-180,83-180]? s=36, delta=5, [48-36*5,83-36*5]=[48-180,83-180]=[-132,-97], negative, safe.\n\nThen to y=9 at t=18.\n\nBut this takes many more turns: from t=12 to t=18, with actions.\n\nBut compared to H=2 in first plan.\n\nSo indeed, the direct up-up is fastest.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=2, with actions U at t=12 and U at t=13.\n\nSo the sequence should be:\n\nTurn t_12: U\n\nTurn t_13: U\n\nIn the answer format.\n\nBut let's write it properly.\n\nThe boxed answer.\n\nAlso, H=2, but I think the sequence implies H.\n\nThe problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\", but in the answer format, it only shows the sequence, so probably H is clear from sequence.\n\nIn the format, it says:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1}\n...\n}\n\nSo for t1=12, H=2, so two lines.\n\nNow, I think that's it.\n\nBut just to be paranoid, is there any car that might affect at t=13 on y=8?\n\nFor example, freeway 8 only has that one car, which we checked.\n\nNo other cars.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nPerhaps the player position is x=0 always, but cars move, but we only care when 0 is in span for the row we are on.\n\nSo I think fine.\n\nSo the answer should be:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\n}\n\nIn the format, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc., so with t_1=12.\n\nIn the box, it might be written with the variable.\n\nBut since t1 given, we can use numbers.\n\nIn the example, it might be.\n\nI think it's clear.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 7) at turn \\(t_1 = 12\\) and aims to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\nThe dangerous times for each freeway, when a car occupies position 0, are:\n- \\(y = 1\\) at turn 13\n- \\(y = 2\\) at turns 16, 17, 18\n- \\(y = 3\\) at turn 16\n- \\(y = 4\\) at turn 16\n- \\(y = 5\\) at turns 19, 20\n- \\(y = 6\\) at turn 14\n- \\(y = 7\\) at turn 14\n- \\(y = 8\\) at turn 14\n\nAt turn 12, the player is at \\(y = 7\\), which is safe since no car occupies position 0 on freeway 7 at this turn.\n\nTo reach \\(y = 9\\) in minimal turns, moving up twice is optimal:\n- At turn 12, action \\(U\\) moves the player to \\(y = 8\\) at the start of turn 13.\n- At turn 13, \\(y = 8\\) is safe because position 0 is not occupied on freeway 8 (span is [12, 47]).\n- Action \\(U\\) at turn 13 moves the player to \\(y = 9\\) at the start of turn 14.\n- At turn 14, \\(y = 9\\) is not a freeway, so no collision is possible, and the goal is reached.\n\nThis sequence takes \\(H = 2\\) turns, which is minimal since moving from \\(y = 7\\) to \\(y = 9\\) requires at least two up moves.\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn } 12: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 13: \\text{ U}\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at position (0, 8) at turn t_1 = 13. The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. Since the player is at y=8, and needs to go to y=9, which is probably the top row, and y=0 to y=9, so y=9 is the target.\n\nThe movement: actions U (up) increases y by 1, D (down) decreases by 1, S (stay) keeps y same. But y is from 0 to 9, so if at y=9, U might not be allowed, but since we're going to y=9, we don't need to go higher. Similarly, at y=0, D might not be allowed.\n\nIn this case, start at y=8, target y=9, so we need to go up once, but we have to avoid cars on the freeways when we are on them.\n\nCollision occurs only if at turn T, the player is on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there is a car where 0 is in its span at that turn. The span is the positions it occupies.\n\nThe car positions are given for turn t_1=13, and we need to find where they are at future turns based on their speed and direction.\n\nAlso, note that when you move to a new y, you are not on that freeway until the next turn. The note says: if you move to y_{T+1} at turn T, you are not on y_{T+1} at turn T, so you don't collide with cars on y_{T+1} at turn T, only at turn T+1 when you are there.\n\nSimilarly, when you leave a freeway, you might avoid collisions.\n\nNow, the player is at (0,8) at turn 13. I need to get to (0,9) as soon as possible.\n\nSince y=9 is the target, and it's not a freeway (freeways are y=1 to 8), so no cars on y=9 or y=0. So once at y=9, no collision possible.\n\nTo reach y=9, from y=8, I need to go up. But when I go up, I move to y=9 at some turn.\n\nLet me denote the turns starting from t=13.\n\nAt turn T, the player position y_T.\n\nStart: T=13, y=8.\n\nI need y_H = 9 for some H, with minimal H.\n\nSince I start at y=8, if I go up immediately at T=13, then y_14 = 9, and I reach at turn 14? Let's see the sequence.\n\nAt turn T, I take action a_T, which determines y_{T+1}.\n\nThe position is updated as y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t based on a_t.\n\nSo at time t, after action a_t, position becomes y_{t+1}.\n\nIn the state, at turn t_1, position is given, so that's before any action.\n\nSo at turn 13, position is (0,8), meaning y_13 = 8.\n\nThen I take action a_13, which sets y_14.\n\nThen a_14 sets y_15, and so on, until y_{13+H} = 9 for some H, where H is the number of turns, so the sequence of actions from t=13 to t=13+H-1, and y_{13+H} = 9.\n\nMinimal H means reaching as soon as possible.\n\nThe smallest possible H is 1: if I go up at turn 13, then y_14 = 8 + 1 = 9, so at turn 14, I'm at y=9.\n\nBut I need to check if at any point I collide with cars.\n\nWhen do collisions happen?\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if the player is on a freeway y_T (between 1 and 8), and for that freeway, at turn T, there is a car with 0 in its span.\n\nThe player is at (0, y_T), so x=0 always, so we care about whether at x=0, there is a car on row y at time T.\n\nSpecifically, for freeway k=y_T, at turn T, if 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway.\n\nNow, at turn 13, y_13 = 8, which is a freeway, so I need to check if at turn 13, on freeway 8, there is a car with 0 in its span.\n\nSimilarly, if I stay or move, I might be on other freeways.\n\nBut for H=1: I take a_13 = U, so y_14 = 9.\n\nAt turn 13, I am at y=8, so I need to check for collision at turn 13 on freeway 8.\n\nIf no collision at turn 13, then I take action, and at turn 14 I am at y=9, not a freeway, so no collision possible.\n\nSo, is there a collision at turn 13 on freeway 8?\n\nFreeway 8: cars: (12, 47, left, 36)\n\nDirection left, so moving left.\n\nAt turn T, the car span: since left-moving, span at time T is [h - s(T - t_1), τ - s(T - t_1)]\n\nt_1 = 13, so for any turn T, the span is based on T - 13.\n\nAt turn T, span for left-moving car: [h - s(T - 13), τ - s(T - 13)]\n\nFor right-moving: [τ + s(T - 13), h + s(T - 13)]\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 8: one car: head h=12, tail τ=47? That seems odd.\n\nTypically, for a left-moving car, head is at the left, tail at right, so as it moves left, head decreases.\n\nBut here, (12, 47, left, 36), but 12 < 47, so if head is 12 and tail 47, and moving left, head should be smaller, but 12 is smaller than 47? I think I need to interpret the coordinates.\n\nThe span: for left-moving, it says Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nAt t_1, [h, τ], and since moving left, both decrease.\n\nIn this case, for freeway 8, at t_1=13, car is (12, 47, left, 36), so Span(13) = [12, 47]? But [12,47] means from 12 to 47, which is increasing, but moving left, so positions should be decreasing? I think there might be confusion in head and tail.\n\nLook at the direction: for left-moving, it says Span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)], so at T, the left end is h - sΔT, and right end is τ - sΔT.\n\nBut if at t_1, [h, τ], and moving left, if h is the head (front), then for left-moving, head is left, so smaller x, tail is right, larger x.\n\nIn the notation, for left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ], with h and τ, and since moving left, both decrease.\n\nIn freeway 8, (12, 47, left, 36), so at t_1=13, span is [12,47], meaning positions from 12 to 47 inclusive? But it's a car, so it occupies integer positions.\n\nThen at time T, span is [12 - 36(T-13), 47 - 36(T-13)]\n\nSimilarly for other directions.\n\nNow, collision at turn T on freeway k if 0 is in the span of any car on k at that T.\n\nFor freeway 8 at turn 13: span [12,47], 0 is not in [12,47], since 12 to 47, all positive, 0 not included. So no collision at turn 13 on freeway 8.\n\nTherefore, if I take a_13 = U, then at turn 13, no collision (since 0 not in [12,47]), then I move to y=9 at turn 14, no freeway, so done in H=1 turn? H is the number of actions, from t=13 to t=13+H-1.\n\nSequence: one action at t=13, then position at t=14 is y=9.\n\nH=1, actions from t=13 to t=13+1-1 = t=13, one action.\n\nBut let's confirm the time.\n\nAt turn 13, position y=8.\n\nAfter action a_13, y_14 = y_13 + Δy.\n\nIf a_13 = U, y_14 = 9.\n\nAt turn 13, I am at y=8, and since no collision, I can take action.\n\nThen at turn 14, I am at y=9, which is not a freeway, so no collision.\n\nSo in one step, I reach y=9.\n\nBut is that possible? I need to make sure that during the move, no issue.\n\nThe collision is only checked when I am on the freeway at a given turn.\n\nWhen I am at y=8 at turn 13, and I take U, I move to y=9 at turn 14.\n\nI am never on y=9 at a turn where it might have cars, but y=9 has no cars.\n\ny=9 is not a freeway, so no cars.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 13, on y=8, no car at x=0.\n\nSo it seems fine.\n\nBut let me check other freeways, but I am only on y=8 at turn 13, so only need to check that.\n\nPerhaps I should verify if for H=1 it works.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), and I can do it in one action.\n\nBut maybe I misread. The player is at (0,8), freeway y=8 has cars, but at x=0, is it occupied?\n\nAt turn 13, freeway 8: car span [12,47], x=0 not in, so no.\n\nPerhaps I need to see if at the moment of moving, but the note says: if you move to y_{T+1} at turn T, you are not on y_{T+1} at turn T, so for collision at turn T, only y_T matters.\n\nSo yes, for turn T=13, y_T=8, and on freeway 8, no car at x=0.\n\nSo a_13=U should work, H=1.\n\nBut that seems too easy, and probably I missed something. Let me see the car on freeway 8.\n\nSpeed is 36, left-moving. At turn 13, [12,47], so at x=0, which is left of 12, so as time passes, the car moves left, so it might reach x=0 at some point.\n\nBut at turn 13, it's not at x=0, and since I am only at turn 13 on y=8, and I leave immediately, so for that instant, no collision.\n\nIf I stayed, it might hit later, but I don't stay.\n\nSimilarly, for other actions.\n\nBut let me confirm with the car positions.\n\nPerhaps for y=8, the car is moving left at speed 36, so at turn T, position left end: 12 - 36(T-13), right end 47 - 36(T-13)\n\nAt T=13, left=12, right=47\n\nAt T=14, left=12-36= -24, right=47-36=11\n\nAt T=15, left=12-72= -60, right=47-72= -25, and so on.\n\nBut at T=13, x=0 not in [12,47], so no issue.\n\nNow, but I need to reach y=9, which is not a freeway, so no problem.\n\nPerhaps the target is (0,9), and I need to be there at some turn, but since no cars, it's fine.\n\nBut why is there information about other freeways? Maybe if I had to go through them, but in this case, I start at y=8, can go directly to y=9.\n\nBut y=8 to y=9, only one step.\n\nUnless at turn 13, on y=8, there is a car at x=0, but there isn't.\n\nLet me double-check the car state for freeway 8: (12,47,left,36), at T=13, [12,47], 0 not in, yes.\n\nPerhaps I misread the car notation.\n\nAnother thing: the player is at x=0, and cars on freeways, so for collision, we care about x=0.\n\nBut in the span, if the car covers x=0.\n\nHere, [12,47] at T=13, min 12>0, so no.\n\nBut let me see if for other H, but H=1 should work.\n\nBut perhaps I need to consider that when I go to y=9, but y=9 is safe.\n\nMaybe the vertical axis is y=0 to 9, and freeways y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nStart at y=8, which is freeway, but I can leave immediately.\n\nBut let me see the other freeways; perhaps if I had to move down or something, but no need.\n\nPerhaps for y=8, the car is such that at the turn I am there, it's safe, but if I delay, it might not be.\n\nBut since I can go immediately, it should be fine.\n\nBut let's look at the car list; there are cars on other freeways, but since I don't visit them, I don't care.\n\nFor example, if I were at y=0, I need to go up, but here I'm at y=8.\n\nAnother thing: the player update, y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with y between 0 and 9, so at y=8, I can go U to 9, D to 7, or S stay.\n\nBut to reach 9, U is direct.\n\nPerhaps there is a reason I cannot go U immediately, but I don't see.\n\nUnless at turn 13, on freeway 8, there is a car at x=0, but there isn't.\n\nLet me calculate the span at T=13 for freeway 8.\n\nCar: head h=12, tail τ=47, direction left, speed 36.\n\nSpan at T: [h - s(T-13), τ - s(T-13)] = [12 - 36(T-13), 47 - 36(T-13)]\n\nAt T=13: [12 - 0, 47 - 0] = [12,47]\n\n0 not in [12,47], so no collision.\n\nSimilarly, for other times, but I am only at y=8 at T=13.\n\nSo action a_13 = U should work.\n\nBut the problem is to output the sequence, and H=1.\n\nBut let me see the answer format, it should be Turn t_1: a_{t_1}, etc.\n\nFor H=1, it would be Turn 13: U\n\nThen at turn 14, position is (0,9), reached.\n\nBut is turn 14 the turn when I reach? The position is after the action.\n\nAt turn 13, position (0,8), take action U, then at turn 14, position (0,9).\n\nAnd turn 14 is when I am at y=9, which is the target.\n\nThe target is to reach (0,9), so at some turn, y_t =9.\n\nHere at t=14, y=9.\n\nMinimal turns: H=1 action.\n\nBut perhaps I need to consider if y=9 is reached at the turn, but at turn 13 I am at 8, so after action, turn 14 at 9.\n\nThe number of turns H from t_1, meaning the actions taken from t_1 to t_1+H-1, so for H=1, one action at t_1.\n\nPerhaps the player is considered to have reached at the turn when y_t=9, so at t=14.\n\nBut with one action.\n\nBut let me check if there is any constraint that prevents this.\n\nAnother thing: the car on freeway 8 is moving left fast, but at T=13, it's not at 0, so ok.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 9, but there is no freeway 9.\n\nOr maybe when I am at y=8, and I go U, but during the move, but the note says that when you move, you are not on the new freeway until the next turn, so no issue.\n\nSo I think H=1 is possible.\n\nBut that seems suspicious because the problem provides many cars, suggesting that it might not be straightforward.\n\nPerhaps I misread the initial position.\n\nCurrent turn t_1=13, player position (0,8), so y=8.\n\nTarget (0,9).\n\nFreeway y=8 has car (12,47,left,36), at T=13, [12,47], 0 not in.\n\nBut let me check if at T=13, for other freeways, but I am not on them.\n\nUnless the player must be on freeways when moving, but no, only if on freeway at that turn.\n\nPerhaps for y=9, but no.\n\nAnother idea: when I go to y=9, is it possible that at that turn, but y=9 has no cars, so no collision possible.\n\nSo I think it should be fine.\n\nBut let me simulate for one step.\n\nTurn 13: player at (0,8), on freeway 8. Check cars on freeway 8 at T=13: span [12,47], x=0 not in, so no collision. Take action U. Then player moves to (0,9) for turn 14.\n\nAt turn 14, player at (0,9), not a freeway, so no collision check, and target reached.\n\nSo done.\n\nBut perhaps the car on freeway 8 at T=13 is not at 0, but let's see if at T=14, but I am not on y=8 at T=14.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nMaybe for freeway 9, but there is no freeway 9.\n\nOr perhaps the vertical axis: y=0 to 9, freeways 1 to 8, so y=9 is safe.\n\nSo I think H=1 is correct.\n\nBut let's look at the car list for other freeways; for example, freeway 6 and 7 have cars moving left at speed 24, but I don't visit them.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 1 has a car, but I am at y=8.\n\nSo no.\n\nPerhaps the player needs to be at (0,9) at a turn when it is safe, but since no cars, always safe.\n\nSo I think it's possible.\n\nBut maybe I misread the car on freeway 8.\n\nFreeway 8: (12,47,left,36)\n\nBut head 12, tail 47, and moving left, so at T=13, it occupies x=12 to x=47.\n\nx=0 is not occupied.\n\nPerhaps the coordinates are such that 0 is included later, but not at T=13.\n\nSo for this turn, safe.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 1, with action U at turn 13.\n\nBut let's confirm the answer format.\n\nThe sequence is only one action: Turn 13: U\n\nAnd H=1.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\", so for H=1.\n\nBut perhaps I need to output the sequence.\n\nBut in the box, it should be Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\n\nSo for this case, Turn 13: U\n\nBut let me see if there is a reason why I cannot do that.\n\nAnother thing: the car on freeway 8 is (12,47,left,36), but 47 to 12, that's a long car, but still, at x=0 not covered.\n\nPerhaps the span includes the endpoints, so [12,47] means positions 12,13,...,47, all greater than 0.\n\nYes.\n\nMaybe for freeway 2, there are cars, but I am not there.\n\nI think I am overcomplicating; it should be fine.\n\nBut let's assume that for some reason it's not possible, but I don't see why.\n\nPerhaps at turn 13, on y=8, there is another car, but only one car listed.\n\nOr perhaps I misread the car state.\n\nFreeway 8: only one car: (12,47,left,36)\n\nYes.\n\nPerhaps the direction: left-moving, so positions decreasing.\n\nBut at T=13, x=12 to 47.\n\nx=0 is left, so not covered.\n\nSo I think it's safe.\n\nTherefore, the action is U at turn 13.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), and with one action, done.\n\nBut let's see the initial turn is t_1=13, so output should be Turn 13: U\n\nBut in the sequence, for t from 0 to H-1, but here H=1, so only t=13.\n\nThe answer format: \\{a_{t_1 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{H-1}, so for H=1, t=0, a_{t_1 +0} = a_13\n\nSo Turn 13: U\n\nThen box that.\n\nBut I feel like this might be wrong because of the other cars, but I think it's correct.\n\nPerhaps for y=8, when I am there at T=13, it is safe, but if I take S or D, it might be unsafe later, but I don't need to.\n\nOr perhaps to reach y=9, but y=9 might be considered, but no.\n\nAnother thought: the player position is at integer y, and when I take U, I move to y+1, but during the move, is there a moment when I am between, but the game is discrete, so no, it's per turn.\n\nThe collision is checked at the turn based on the position at that turn.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nPerhaps the car on freeway 8 at T=13 is not at 0, but let's calculate for other turns to see.\n\nFor example, at T=14, if I were on y=8, span would be [12-36, 47-36] = [-24,11], which includes x=0, since -24 to 11, 0 is in between.\n\nSo if I stayed at y=8 at T=14, I would collide.\n\nBut I don't stay; I leave at T=13.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nSimilarly, for other freeways.\n\nSo I think H=1 is possible.\n\nBut let's see the car for freeway 6 and 7, but I don't visit.\n\nFreeway 6: (24,47,left,24), at T=13, [24,47], 0 not in.\n\nFreeway 7: same, (24,47,left,24), same.\n\nFreeway 5: etc.\n\nBut I am at y=8, so not relevant.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 1, with action U at turn 13.\n\nSo the sequence is just one action.\n\nFor the answer:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 13: U\n}\n\nBut let's write it properly.\n\nThe format should be:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\n\nSo Turn 13: U\n\nAnd that's it.\n\nBut since H=1, no other turns.\n\nPerhaps I need to specify the number of turns, but the answer format is only the sequence.\n\nThe box contains the sequence of actions.\n\nSo for this case, only one line.\n\nBut let me make sure that at turn 13, on freeway 8, no other cars.\n\nFreeway 8 has only one car listed.\n\nIn the table, for freeway 8: (12,47,left,36)\n\nYes.\n\nPerhaps the tail and head are switched for direction, but in the update rule, for left-moving, it's [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT], with [h,τ] at t_1, so it's consistent.\n\nFor example, at t_1, [12,47], moving left, so h=12 is the left end, I assume.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving.\n\nIn freeway 2, there is a car with (28,17,right,4), let's see: head 28, tail 17, but for right-moving, if head is at front, moving right, head should be larger, but 28>17, so [28,17]? But 28>17, so the span might be from min to max.\n\nIn the update, for right-moving: Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nAt t_1, Span= [τ, h]\n\nFor freeway 2, car: (-12,-23,right,4), so τ=-12, h=-23? That seems odd, because -12 > -23, so [τ, h] = [-12, -23], which is from -12 to -23, but that's decreasing, but positions should be increasing for right-moving.\n\nI think there might be a confusion in the notation.\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\nFor car k on freeway i, at turn t_1, it has head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s.\n\nThen for left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nFor right-moving: Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nIn the case of right-moving, at t_1, Span= [τ, h], and since it's moving right, τ and h, with τ being the left end, h the right end? But in the notation, for right-moving, it says Span(t_1) = [τ, h], and then Span(T) = [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT], so at T, the left end is τ + sΔT, right end h + sΔT, so at t_1, left end τ, right end h.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, at t_1, left end h, right end τ, then at T, left end h - sΔT, right end τ - sΔT.\n\nIn the car state, for example, freeway 2: cars (-12,-23,right,4), so for this car, d=right, so at t_1, Span= [τ, h] = [-12, -23], but -12 to -23, that's from -12 to -23, which is left to right? No, numerically -12 > -23, so it's from higher to lower number, but in terms of position, x=-23 is left of x=-12, so if moving right, the car should have left end at min x, right end at max x.\n\nI think there is an inconsistency.\n\nFor this car, τ=-12, h=-23, but -12 > -23, so [τ, h] = [-12, -23], which implies from x=-12 to x=-23, but x=-12 is right of x=-23, so it's from right to left, but direction is right, which is confusing.\n\nPerhaps the span is always given as [min, max] or something.\n\nLet's see the values.\n\nFor freeway 2, first car: (-12,-23,right,4)\n\nAt t_1, Span= [τ, h] = [-12, -23], but since -23 < -12, it should be from -23 to -12, but the notation says [τ, h] with τ and h, so for this case, τ=-12, h=-23, so [ -12, -23], which is decreasing, but in terms of positions, it occupies from min to max.\n\nBut in the set, 0 is in the span if min <= 0 <= max.\n\nSimilarly for all.\n\nFor this car, at t_1, min x = min(-12, -23) = -23, max x = max(-12, -23) = -12, so span from -23 to -12, which includes positions like -23,-22,...,-12.\n\nThen 0 not in, since -23 to -12, all negative.\n\nSimilarly, for the car (28,17,right,4) on freeway 2, at t_1, [τ, h] = [28,17]? τ=28, h=17, so [28,17], min=17, max=28, so [17,28], and moving right.\n\nIn general, for collision, we care if 0 is between the min and max of the span at that turn.\n\nFor freeway 8 at T=13, car (12,47,left,36), at t_1, for left-moving, [h,τ] = [12,47], min=12, max=47, so [12,47], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly for other.\n\nSo back to the point, for H=1, it should work.\n\nPerhaps the player is at (0,8), and to go to (0,9), but (0,9) is the position, and at turn 14, it is reached.\n\nI think I should conclude that H=1 with U.\n\nBut since the problem has many cars, maybe for this position, it is safe, but let's assume that.\n\nPerhaps for y=8, there is a car at some other x, but not at 0.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nTherefore, the minimal number of turns is 1, with action U at turn 13.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 8) at turn \\(t_1 = 13\\). The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\nAt turn 13, the player is on freeway \\(y = 8\\). The car on freeway 8 has state \\((12, 47, \\text{left}, 36)\\). The span of this car at turn \\(T\\) is given by:\n\\[\n\\text{Span}(T) = [12 - 36(T - 13), 47 - 36(T - 13)]\n\\]\nAt turn \\(T = 13\\):\n\\[\n\\text{Span}(13) = [12 - 36(0), 47 - 36(0)] = [12, 47]\n\\]\nThe position \\(x = 0\\) is not in \\([12, 47]\\), so no collision occurs at turn 13.\n\nTaking action \\(a_{13} = U\\) (up) moves the player to \\(y_{14} = 8 + 1 = 9\\) at turn 14. The position (0, 9) is not on a freeway (freeways are only \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\)), so no collision check is needed at turn 14 or beyond. The target (0, 9) is reached at turn 14.\n\nThis sequence requires only one action (\\(H = 1\\)), which is minimal since the player starts at \\(y = 8\\) and must reach \\(y = 9\\), requiring at least one up action.\n\nNo other freeways are visited, so the cars on other freeways do not affect this sequence.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 13: U\n}",
