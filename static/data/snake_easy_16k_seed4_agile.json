It's turn 0, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since the borders are from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7. There's an internal obstacle at (3,6), so I must avoid that.\n> \n> The snake starts at position [(3,3)] with head direction left (L). Since it's a single segment, it's just the head, so no body to worry about yet. When it eats food, it will grow.\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (3,5): value +1, life span 10\n> \n> - (6,6): value +1, life span 10\n> \n> - (2,3): value +1, life span 10\n> \n> All food is positive, no negative food here. Life span 10 means they disappear after 10 turns, including this one, so I have 10 turns to eat them before they vanish.\n> \n> Since the snake is only one segment, I don't have to worry about body collisions yet. But I need to think about future growth and potential collisions.\n> \n> Current head position: (3,3), direction L. Possible moves: I can move Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), or Right (R). But since the head direction is L, I cannot instantly reverse to R on this turn. The rule says: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\" Since this is turn 0, and I'm choosing the action for turn 0, I can choose any direction except the opposite of current direction. Current direction is L, so opposite is R. Therefore, I cannot move Right on this turn. I can move U, D, or L.\n> \n> Available moves from (3,3):\n> \n> - Up: (3,4)\n> \n> - Down: (3,2)\n> \n> - Left: (2,3)\n> \n> - Right: (4,3) but I can't move right because it's opposite to current direction L.\n> \n> I need to confirm the grid. Borders: x=0 and x=7 are walls, y=0 and y=7 are walls. So:\n> \n> - Up to (3,4): y=4 is within 0 to 7, no wall.\n> \n> - Down to (3,2): y=2 within range.\n> \n> - Left to (2,3): x=2 within range.\n> \n> - Right to (4,3): x=4 within range, but I can't move right because of no instant reverse.\n> \n> Also, internal obstacle at (3,6), but that's not relevant for immediate moves since I'm at (3,3).\n> \n> Now, food at (3,5), (6,6), (2,3).\n> \n> (2,3) is directly left of me, at (2,3).

After eating, the new segment will be added, but since it's the first food, the tail will be at (3,3) initially, I think.\n> \n> Snake growth: when you eat food, the tail doesn't move that turn, so the snake grows by one segment.\n> \n> Currently, snake is [(3,3)], after moving to (2,3) and eating, the snake becomes [(2,3), (3,3)] with head at (2,3) and tail at (3,3).\n> \n> Then on next turn, when I move, the tail will move to follow, so if I move from (2,3), the tail might stay or move depending on direction.\n> \n> But for now, let's think about immediate actions.\n> \n> I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score and avoid risks.\n> \n> First, let's list all food:\n> \n> - Food A: (3,5), value +1, life 10\n> \n> - Food B: (6,6), value +1, life 10\n> \n> - Food C: (2,3), value +1, life 10\n> \n> Food C is at (2,3), which is adjacent left.\n> \n> If I move left to (2,3), I eat it immediately on turn 0.\n> \n> Then snake grows to length 2: positions [(2,3), (3,3)]\n> \n> Head direction: since I moved left, new direction is L.\n> \n> Now, after eating, the food at (2,3) is gone, so only (3,5) and (6,6) left.\n> \n> But life span decreases each turn, so after turn 0, life span becomes 9 for all, since it decreases including current turn? Let's see the rule: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> For food, at turn t, when it's present, life span decreases by 1 each turn, including the turn it's on.\n> \n> So at turn 0, food has life span 10. After turn 0 is executed, life span becomes 9, and so on, until it reaches 0, then it disappears.\n> \n> In this case, since I'm at turn 0, before moving, food has life span 10. If I eat it on this turn, it's consumed before life span decreases, I think.\n> \n> The life span decrease happens every turn, including when the food is eaten or not.\n> \n> But if eaten, it's removed.\n> \n> Now, back to the move.\n> \n> Option 1: Move left to (2,3), eat food C, grow to length 2.\n> \n> Then positions: head (2,3), tail (3,3)\n> \n> Head direction: L (since I moved left)\n> \n> Now, from (2,3), possible moves: U, D, L, R.\n> \n> But current direction L, so cannot move right (opposite).\n> \n> Available: U to (2,4), D to (2,2), L to (1,3), R to (3,3) but cannot because opposite to L.\n> \n> R to (3,3) is right, which is opposite to left, so cannot.\n> \n> Also, (3,3) is currently the tail, but since the snake will move, when I move the head, the tail will also move, so I can move to where the tail is, because the tail will vacate the spot.\n> \n> Rule: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So from (2,3), moving to (3,3) is possible because the tail is there, but after moving, head goes to (3,3), tail moves... let's see.\n> \n> If head is at (2,3), tail at (3,3), and I move head to (3,3), since the tail is at (3,3), but when head moves to (3,3), at the same time, the tail moves away?

No.\n> \n> Sequence: at start of turn, snake positions: head at A, tail at B.\n> \n> I move head to C.\n> \n> If C is not food, then tail moves to the next segment position, which would be A, so snake becomes head at C, tail at A.\n> \n> If C is food, tail stays, so snake becomes head at C, tail at B, and a new segment is added, so positions [C, A, B]? No.\n> \n> Let's think carefully.\n> \n> Initial: segments [P0] (head)\n> \n> After moving to new cell Q:\n> \n> If Q has food, eat it, snake grows: new segments [Q, P0]\n> \n> If no food, snake moves: segments [Q], but since length 1, it's just [Q], no tail move.\n> \n> For length 1: moving to new cell, if eat food, snake becomes [new_pos, old_pos], length 2.\n> \n> If no food, snake moves to [new_pos], still length 1.\n> \n> In this case, if I move from (3,3) to (2,3) and eat, snake is [(2,3), (3,3)].\n> \n> Then from (2,3), if I move to (3,3), which is the tail position.\n> \n> Now, (3,3) does not have food (since we ate it or it's empty), so no food eaten.\n> \n> Therefore, when I move head to (3,3), the tail moves to the previous head position, which is (2,3).\n> \n> So new positions: head at (3,3), tail at (2,3)?

After move, head is at new pos, body is only (2,3), so (3,3) is free.\n> \n> But moving to (3,3) is moving right, which is opposite to current direction L, so it's not allowed anyway. So I don't have that option.\n> \n> For the available moves: (1,3), (2,4), (2,2), none of these are occupied by body after move. (1,3) was empty, (2,4) empty, (2,2) empty. Body will be at (2,3), which is not the new head position.\n> \n> So all moves are safe from collision this turn.\n> \n> Now, I need to think about food and future turns.\n> \n> Food locations:\n> \n> (3,5): this is above, at y=5, x=3.\n> \n> (6,6): bottom-right, x=6,y=6\n> \n> (6,4): x=6,y=4\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (3,6), which is above (3,5).\n> \n> Life spans: all have high life span, 9,9,10, so they won't disappear soon.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan a sequence of actions for multiple turns.\n> \n> The answer should include an action sequence for turn 1, turn 2, etc., up to at least turn 5 or more, but it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", so I should plan for 5 turns or so.\n> \n> Also, in the sequence, I need to specify actions starting from turn 1.\n> \n> But turn 1 is the current turn.\n> \n> Now, to maximize score, I should aim to eat the positive food, but avoid risks.\n> \n> First, let's see which food is reachable.\n> \n> From head at (2,3), food at (3,5) is at distance |3-2| + |5-3| = 1+2=3, so 3 moves away if I go directly.\n> \n> But I need to consider the path.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,4) is |6-2| + |4-3| =4+1=5 moves away.\n> \n> (6,6) is |6-2| + |6-3| =4+3=7 moves away.\n> \n> But with obstacles and snake body, it might be longer.\n> \n> Also, the food at (3,5) is close, but there's an obstacle at (3,6), which might affect movement.\n> \n> (3,6) is a wall cell, so I cannot move there.\n> \n> Now, to get to (3,5), from (2,3), I could go up to (2,4), then (2,5), then to (3,5)? (2,5) to (3,5) is right, but from (2,5) moving to (3,5) is possible.\n> \n> From (2,3), if I go up to (2,4), then up to (2,5), then right to (3,5). That's three moves: U, U, R.\n> \n> I could go left to (1,3), but that might not help for (3,5).\n> \n> (1,3) is away from most food.\n> \n> Down to (2,2) is also away.\n> \n> So probably moving up is better to reach (3,5).\n> \n> But I need to think about after eating, where to go next.\n> \n> Also, there is a risk: \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> But in this case, the tail is at (3,3), and no food there, so not an issue now.\n> \n> Food is at (3,5), not on tail.\n> \n> Now, let's simulate possible paths.\n> \n> First, if I move up to (2,4) on turn 1.\n> \n> Then head at (2,4), body at (2,3).

After head moves to (2,5), body becomes (2,4), and tail moves to previous body position? Tail is (2,3), but since no growth, the segment that was tail moves to where the body was, but it's simpler: the tail moves to the position that the body just left.\n> \n> After move: head new: (2,5), body: previous head (2,4), and the old body (2,3) is vacated.\n> \n> Since no growth, tail is removed, so only head and body.\n> \n> New positions: head (2,5), body (2,4).\n> \n> (2,3) empty.\n> \n> Now turn 3: from (2,5), I can move R to (3,5).

Since we add a segment, the tail stays.\n> \n> Standard growth: when you eat, head moves to food, food is consumed, and a new segment is added at the tail position, so the tail doesn't move; it stays, and the segment before it becomes part of body.\n> \n> So positions: after eating, the head is at the new position, and the body includes all previous positions, with the tail fixed.\n> \n> In this case, before move to (3,5): snake positions [ (2,5), (2,4) ] head (2,5), tail (2,4)\n> \n> After moving to (3,5) and eating: head at (3,5), then the previous head (2,5) becomes first body segment, and the tail (2,4) remains tail, but since growth, a new segment is added? No.\n> \n> When you eat, the tail doesn't move; instead, the snake gains a segment, so the length increases by one.\n> \n> So new positions: head at (3,5), then the previous segments remain, so [ (3,5), (2,5), (2,4) ] head at (3,5), body (2,5), tail (2,4).\n> \n> Yes.\n> \n> Now, at this point, I have eaten one food, score +1.\n> \n> But now, the snake is longer, at positions (3,5), (2,5), (2,4).\n> \n> Tail at (2,4).\n> \n> Now, from here, I need to move to other food.\n> \n> Other food: (6,4) and (6,6).\n> \n> (6,4) is at (6,4), which is to the right and down?

But in this case, when head moves to (2,3), which was tail, but tail was at (2,3), and after move, tail is at (2,4), so (2,3) is now head, but it was just vacated?

It's turn 3, and the grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think? Let me confirm: walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the grid cells are from x=1 to x=6 and y=1 to y=6? No, typically in such grids, walls are boundaries, so coordinates might be from (0,0) to (7,7), but (0,0) to (7,7) with walls on the borders means cells (0,y) and (7,y) for all y, and (x,0), (x,7) for all x are walls. But the border cells are given as walls, so moving to those is deadly.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (3,4), body at (2,4). So the snake has two segments: head and one body part, which is also the tail. Head direction is R, right, so it's moving east.\n> \n> Food:\n> \n> - (3,5) with life span 7, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (6,6) with life span 7, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (6,4) with life span 8, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> All food is positive, no negative food here.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (3,6).\n> \n> I need to plan an action sequence for at least 5 turns ahead, starting from turn 3.\n> \n> Current turn t1=3.\n> \n> Snake head at (3,4), direction R, so it just moved right to (3,4) from, say, (2,4) at turn 2? Positions: [(3,4), (2,4)], so head is (3,4), tail is (2,4). Since it moved right, previous position was left of head, which is (2,4), so yes.\n> \n> Now, possible moves: since head direction is R, I can move U, D, or R, but not L because L would be opposite direction, which is not allowed. Reverse is not allowed, so from R, I cannot go L (left). So options: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), R (right, x+1).\n> \n> Let's list possible actions for turn 3:\n> \n> - U: to (3,5)\n> \n> - D: to (3,3)\n> \n> - R: to (4,4)\n> \n> Now, check for collisions or dangers.\n> \n> First, walls: borders are x=0,7 and y=0,7. So for (3,5): x=3, y=5, which is within 1 to 6? Coordinates: since walls at x=0 and x=7, y=0 and y=7, the playable area should be x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? Let's see: snake is at (3,4) and (2,4), which are both within, I assume x=2 and x=3 are fine. Similarly, food at (3,5), (6,6), (6,4), all seem valid.\n> \n> (3,5): x=3, y=5. If walls are at y=0 and y=7, then y=1 to y=6 should be playable? y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y from 1 to 6 inclusive? But food at (6,6), x=6, y=6. If y=6 is not wall? Walls are y=0 and y=7, so y=1 to y=6 are free, similarly x=1 to x=6.\n> \n> But internal obstacle at (3,6), which is x=3, y=6.\n> \n> y=6 is not wall, since walls are y=0 and y=7, so y=6 is playable except for obstacles.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,6) is playable unless obstacle, but no obstacle there.\n> \n> Now, for move to (3,5): what is there? (3,5) has food with value 1, life span 7.\n> \n> But also, is it safe? No walls, and no body collision? Snake body is at (2,4), which is not (3,5), so moving to (3,5) is safe.\n> \n> If I move to (3,5), I eat the food there, since head moves onto food cell. Then snake grows, so after eating, snake becomes [(3,5), (3,4), (2,4)]? Positions: head moves to (3,5), and since it eats, tail doesn't move? No.\n> \n> When snake eats food, it grows, so the tail stays in place, meaning that after move, head is at new position, body segments follow, but since it eats, a new segment is added, so length increases.\n> \n> Standard snake: when you eat, you move head to food, add a new segment, so the tail doesn't move that turn.\n> \n> But here, positions: current positions [(3,4), (2,4)]. If head moves to (3,5), and eats food there, then new positions: head at (3,5), then the previous head (3,4) becomes body, and (2,4) remains, but since it ate, a new segment is added? No.\n> \n> I think I need to clarify the movement.\n> \n> Typically: at each turn, snake moves one cell in direction, head to new cell. If new cell has food, snake grows, so tail doesn't move, and length increases by one. If no food, tail moves forward, so length same.\n> \n> In terms of positions: before move, positions [H, B1, B2, ..., T]\n> \n> After move: if no eat, new positions [new_H, H, B1, ..., B_{n-1}] so tail T is removed.\n> \n> If eat, new positions [new_H, H, B1, ..., T] so T stays, and new segment added, so positions increase.\n> \n> In this case, snake has only two segments: head and tail. So positions: [H, T] = [(3,4), (2,4)]\n> \n> If head moves to new cell and eats: new head at new cell, then H becomes body, T stays, so positions: [new_head, H, T] so three segments.\n> \n> If no eat, new positions: [new_head, H] and T is removed, so only one body segment? No: after move, if no eat, head to new, then the segment that was head is now body, and tail moves off, so since only two segments, after move no eat: new head at new_pos, and the tail moves to where head was? Let's think.\n> \n> Standard: the body segments follow the head. So for a snake of length L, when it moves, head goes to new cell, each segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> So for two segments: positions P0 (head), P1 (tail).\n> \n> After move to new cell N:\n> \n> - If no eat: new head at N, new body at P0, and P1 is removed, so positions [N, P0]\n> \n> - If eat: new head at N, new body at P0, and P1 stays, so positions [N, P0, P1]\n> \n> In this case, P0 is (3,4), P1 is (2,4).\n> \n> If move to (3,5) and eat, new positions: head (3,5), body (3,4), tail (2,4)\n> \n> Length becomes 3.\n> \n> If move to (3,5) but no food, which there is food, but hypothetically, if no food, move to (3,5), no eat, then positions: head (3,5), body (3,4), and (2,4) is removed? But (2,4) was tail, it moves off, so snake is [ (3,5), (3,4) ]\n> \n> But (3,4) was head, now body.\n> \n> Back to turn 3.\n> \n> Option: move U to (3,5)\n> \n> (3,5) has food, value 1, so if I move there, I eat it, snake grows to length 3: positions [(3,5), (3,4), (2,4)]\n> \n> Head direction: after move, new head direction is U, since I moved up.\n> \n> Then for next turn, I can move from there.\n> \n> But there's a special case: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n> \n> Here, current tail is at (2,4). Is head adjacent to tail? Head at (3,4), tail at (2,4), which are adjacent horizontally.\n> \n> Tail cell has food? The tail is at (2,4), but is there food at (2,4)? In the food positions, only (3,5), (6,6), (6,4) are listed, so no food at (2,4). So no issue.\n> \n> The danger is when tail cell has food and head is adjacent, then if you eat that food, since tail stays, and head moves to where tail was, but tail stays, so they collide immediately.\n> \n> But here, no food at tail, so safe.\n> \n> Move to (3,5) seems good.\n> \n> Option D: to (3,3). (3,3) has no food listed, so no eat. Then snake moves: head to (3,3), body to (3,4), tail (2,4) removed, so positions [(3,3), (3,4)]\n> \n> Length remains 2.\n> \n> Then head direction D.\n> \n> Option R: to (4,4). (4,4) has no food, so no eat, positions [(4,4), (3,4)], tail (2,4) removed.\n> \n> Head direction R.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead. So plan a sequence.\n> \n> Also, food life span: each turn, life span decreases, so food disappears after N turns from now? Life span is given, and decreases every turn including current, so at turn 3, life span 7 means it will disappear after 7 more turns? Or including turn 3?\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So at turn t, food has life span L, it will disappear at turn t + L? For example, at turn 3, life span 7, so it disappears after 7 turns, meaning at turn 10? Countdown decreases every turn including current.\n> \n> Let's read: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So when we are at turn t, and food has life span L, after turn t, countdown becomes L-1, and so on, until 0, then disappears.\n> \n> So at turn t, with life span L, it will be present for L more turns, including turn t, so it disappears at turn t + L.\n> \n> For food at (3,5): life span 7 at turn 3, so it will be there until turn 3 + 7 - 1? Let's clarify.\n> \n> If at turn t, life span is L, and countdown decreases every turn including current, so at turn t, after processing, countdown is L, then at turn t+1, it decreases to L-1, ..., at turn t + L -1, it decreases to 1, then at turn t + L, it decreases to 0 and disappears? Or at turn t + L, after decrease, it disappears.\n> \n> The rule says: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> I think it's safer to assume that at turn t, with life span L, it will disappear at the start of turn t + L, meaning it is present for turns t to t+L-1.\n> \n> For example, at turn 3, life span 7, it is present on turn 3,4,5,6,7,8,9, and disappears before turn 10? Turn t+L is when it disappears.\n> \n> Standard: if countdown starts at L at turn t, decreases each turn, after k turns, countdown is L-k, so when countdown reaches 0, it disappears.\n> \n> At turn t, countdown is L, so after turn t, it decreases to L-1 at start of turn t+1? Or during turn t.\n> \n> The rule says: \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" but it doesn't specify when.\n> \n> For simplicity, I'll assume that at the beginning of each turn, before the snake moves, the countdown decreases, and if 0, food disappears.\n> \n> But the rule says \"including current\", which might mean that on the turn it is spawned, it decreases.\n> \n> But in this state, it's given at turn 3, so for food, life span 7 means it has 7 turns left including turn 3.\n> \n> So after turn 3, it has 6 left, and so on.\n> \n> To be precise: at the start of turn t, for each food, if life span >0, it is present, then after snake move or whatever, at the end of the turn, life span decreases by 1.\n> \n> But for planning, I can think that food will disappear after L turns from now, meaning at turn t + L it is gone.\n> \n> For (3,5) at turn 3, life span 7, so it disappears at turn 3+7=10, so present from turn 3 to 9.\n> \n> Similarly for others.\n> \n> (6,6) life span 7, same, disappears at turn 10.\n> \n> (6,4) life span 8, disappears at turn 11.\n> \n> All have long life, so no immediate decay.\n> \n> Now, back to planning.\n> \n> I need to maximize score, so eat food, but avoid risks.\n> \n> Also, think long-term survival.\n> \n> Current options for turn 3:\n> \n> - U to (3,5): eat food, grow to length 3, positions: [(3,5), (3,4), (2,4)]\n> \n> Head direction U.\n> \n> Then for turn 4, from (3,5), direction U, so can move U, L, R, but not D (reverse).\n> \n> Possible moves: U to (3,6), but (3,6) is an internal obstacle, wall, so cannot move there.\n> \n> L to (2,5), R to (4,5), D to (3,4) but D is reverse, not allowed, since current direction U.\n> \n> So only L or R.\n> \n> (2,5) or (4,5).\n> \n> (2,5): is it safe? No walls, no body, but body will be at (3,4) and (2,4), so (2,5) is empty, I think.\n> \n> Similarly (4,5) empty.\n> \n> Food at (2,5)? No, food only at (6,6), (6,4), and (3,5) will be eaten.\n> \n> After eating (3,5), it's gone.\n> \n> So turn 4, from (3,5), if I go L to (2,5), no food, so snake moves: head to (2,5), body to (3,5), tail to (3,4)? Positions: current after eat: [(3,5), (3,4), (2,4)]\n> \n> After move to (2,5) no eat: head to (2,5), body to (3,5), and tail (3,4) moves to where? The segments: head moves to new, each segment moves to previous position.\n> \n> So from [A,B,C] = [(3,5), (3,4), (2,4)]\n> \n> After move to (2,5) no eat: new head (2,5), then body at (3,5), and body at (3,4), but C was (2,4), which is removed since no eat? Let's index.\n> \n> Positions: index 0: head (3,5), index 1: body (3,4), index 2: tail (2,4)\n> \n> After move to new cell N with no eat: new head at N, new body at position of old head, new tail at position of old body, and old tail is removed.\n> \n> So if move to (2,5), no eat: new positions: head (2,5), body (3,5), and since no eat, the tail (2,4) is removed, so only two segments: [(2,5), (3,5)]\n> \n> Similarly, if I had moved R to (4,5), positions [(4,5), (3,5)]\n> \n> But in this case, from turn 4, after moving to (2,5) or (4,5), length is 2 again? No, after eating at turn 3, snake is length 3, then at turn 4, if no eat, it moves and length stays 3, but since it didn't eat, the tail moves, so positions: for move to (2,5), new head (2,5), new body (3,5), and new tail is the old body (3,4)? Old positions: head (3,5), body (3,4), tail (2,4)\n> \n> After move to (2,5) no eat: head to (2,5), body to (3,5) (old head), and body to (3,4) (old body), and old tail (2,4) is removed. Since no eat, the snake shortens? No, in snake game, when no eat, the tail moves off, so the length decreases only if it was grown, but standard is that length remains the same unless you eat.\n> \n> Clarify the rules.\n> \n> From the problem: \"Length of snake +1\" when eating positive food, and \"unchanged\" for negative or no eat.\n> \n> So when you eat, length increases by 1, when you don't, length stays the same.\n> \n> In terms of positions, when you don't eat, the tail cell is vacated, but the snake has the same number of segments, but since head moves to new cell, and tail moves to the previous position of the second last segment.\n> \n> For a snake of length L, it has L segments.\n> \n> When it moves without eating: head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment in the list, so the last segment (tail) leaves its position, and the new positions have the same length.\n> \n> When eating: head moves to new cell (with food), each body segment moves to previous position, but the tail stays, so a new segment is added at the tail position, length increases.\n> \n> In this case, after eating at (3,5) at turn 3, positions: [(3,5), (3,4), (2,4)] length 3.\n> \n> At turn 4, if I move to (2,5) no eat, then new positions: head to (2,5), body to (3,5) (old head), body to (3,4) (old body), and the old tail (2,4) is removed, so positions [(2,5), (3,5), (3,4)] length 3, same as before.\n> \n> Old body (3,4) moves to where? The segments: the new body segments are the old head and old body, but the old tail is gone.\n> \n> Positions: new head at (2,5), new body at old head position (3,5), new body at old body position (3,4), and the old tail (2,4) is not part of snake anymore.

Since (3,6) is blocked, moving to (3,5) might be risky if I need to go up from there, but not necessarily.\n> \n> First, at turn 4, I must choose action: U, D, or R.\n> \n> If I move U to (4,5): then head at (4,5), body at (4,4), tail at (3,4) but when I move, tail moves?

Directions: U is up, D down, L left, R right.\n> \n> Opposite of U is D, opposite of L is R, etc.\n> \n> After moving U, head direction is U, so I cannot move D next.\n> \n> But moving L is not opposite to U, so it's allowed.\n> \n> Similarly, from (4,5), I can move to (3,5) by moving L.\n> \n> (3,5) has food, so at turn 5, if I go to (3,5), I eat it.\n> \n> But let's see if it's safe.\n> \n> First, option 1: go for (6,4)\n> \n> At turn 4, move R to (5,4). Since no food, snake moves to [ (5,4), (4,4) ], head at (5,4), direction R.\n> \n> Then at turn 5, move R to (6,4). (6,4) has food, so eat it, snake grows: head to (6,4), body at (5,4) and (4,4)? Positions: before move, snake [ (5,4), (4,4) ], move to (6,4) with food, so new head (6,4), body segments: previous head (5,4) and previous body (4,4), so snake is [ (6,4), (5,4), (4,4) ], length 3.\n> \n> Now, (6,4) is at x=6, y=4. Borders: x=7 is wall, so (6,4) is not wall, but x=6 is within 1 to 6, so safe.\n> \n> After that, I need to move away. Possible moves from (6,4): U to (6,5), D to (6,3), L to (5,4), but (5,4) is the body, so moving there would cause collision? At turn 5, after eating, positions [ (6,4), (5,4), (4,4) ]\n> \n> If I move L to (5,4), (5,4) is occupied by body, so head touches body, collision, dead.\n> \n> Similarly, moving D to (6,3) or U to (6,5) should be safe, assuming no other issues.\n> \n> (6,3) y=3, not border, no obstacle mentioned.\n> \n> (6,5) similarly.\n> \n> But direction: after moving to (6,4), head direction is R (since I moved right to get there).\n> \n> Then at turn 6, I can move U, D, or L, but not R (opposite).\n> \n> L to (5,4) is body, so must not do that.\n> \n> So I must move U or D.\n> \n> Say, move U to (6,5).\n> \n> Then positions: head to (6,5), no food there, so tail moves, snake: [ (6,5), (6,4) ]? Let's see: previous positions [ (6,4), (5,4), (4,4) ], head moves to (6,5), no food, so tail (4,4) is removed, new positions [ (6,5), (6,4) ], since (6,4) was head, now body, and (5,4) is still there? Standard: when moving without eating, head moves to new cell, each segment moves to previous position of the segment ahead.\n> \n> So from [head, body1, tail] positions.\n> \n> After move to (6,5) without eating, head moves to (6,5), body1 (which was (6,4)) moves to where head was? No.\n> \n> Positions list: index 0: head, index 1: body segment after head, etc.\n> \n> At turn 5 after eating: positions [ (6,4), (5,4), (4,4) ] so head at (6,4), body at (5,4), tail at (4,4).\n> \n> Now move to new cell: if no food, head moves to new position, body segments shift: the first body segment moves to previous head position, second to previous first body position, etc., tail is removed.\n> \n> So if move to (6,5) no food: new head at (6,5), then body at previous head (6,4), and tail at previous body (5,4)? Since only two segments now? Length is 3, so three positions.\n> \n> After move to (6,5) no food: new head (6,5), then the segment that was body is now at previous head (6,4), and the segment that was tail is now at previous body (5,4), so positions [ (6,5), (6,4), (5,4) ]\n> \n> Then tail (5,4) will move next time.\n> \n> Similarly, if I move D to (6,3), similar.\n> \n> But at (6,4), I am at the right edge, x=6, so moving left is blocked by body, must go up or down.\n> \n> Now, from there, I can go to other food.\n> \n> But let's see the other option.\n> \n> Option 2: go for (3,5)\n> \n> At turn 4, move U to (4,5). No food, so snake moves to [ (4,5), (4,4) ], head at (4,5), direction U.\n> \n> Then at turn 5, move L to (3,5). (3,5) has food, so eat it, snake grows to length 3: positions [ (3,5), (4,5), (4,4) ]\n> \n> Now, (3,5) is at x=3, y=5.

Possible: U, D, R.\n- **Food**:\n  - (3, 5): +1, lifespan 5 (available until turn 9).\n  - (6, 6): +1, lifespan 5 (available until turn 9).\n  - (6, 4): +1, lifespan 6 (available until turn 10).\n  - (3, 2): +1, lifespan 9 (available until turn 13).\n\n### Immediate Options:\n1. **Move Right (R) to (6, 4)**:\n   - Eat food at (6, 4): +1 score, length increases to 3.\n   - Next moves: From (6, 4), can only move U or D (R is wall, L is reverse).\n   - Path: Can then move U to (6, 5), then U to (6, 6) to eat another food (+1).\n   - Total score: 2 (from (6, 4) and (6, 6)), but miss (3, 5).\n\n2. **Move Up (U) to (5, 5)**:\n   - No food eaten. Length remains 2.\n   - Next moves: From (5, 5), can move L to (4, 5), then L to (3, 5) to eat (+1).\n   - Path: Then can move down to (3, 4), (3, 3), (3, 2) to eat (+1).\n   - Total score: 2 (from (3, 5) and (3, 2)), but miss (6, 6).\n\n3. **Move Down (D) to (5, 3)**:\n   - No food eaten. Length remains 2.\n   - Next moves: Can move towards (3, 2) but it's less urgent (lifespan 9).\n   - Not optimal for maximizing score quickly.\n\n### Decision:\n- Moving **Right (R)** allows eating (6, 4) immediately and potentially (6, 6) soon after, totaling +2 score.\n- Moving **Up (U)** allows eating (3, 5) and (3, 2), also totaling +2 score, but (3, 2) can be eaten later.\n- Moving **Right (R)** is more efficient for immediate score and sets up a path to eat (6, 6) next.\n\n### Risks:\n- After eating (6, 4), the snake is at (6, 4) with limited moves (U/D), but this is manageable.\n- No immediate collision risks.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe best immediate action is to **move Right (R)** to eat the food at (6, 4) and set up for eating (6, 6) next.\n\n\\boxed{R}",

So, the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls block movement.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (5,4), body at (4,4). So, the snake is only two segments long right now.

Value is +1 for all, and they all increase length when eaten.\n> \n> Life span: for (3,5), life span 5 at turn 5, so it disappears after 5 turns, meaning if not eaten by turn 10, it's gone. Similarly, (6,6) life span 5, disappears at turn 10; (6,4) life span 6, disappears at turn 11; (3,2) life span 9, disappears at turn 14.\n> \n> Current turn is 5, so:\n> \n> - (3,5): disappears at turn 5 + 5 = turn 10? Life span is the number of turns it remains, including the current turn. So if life span is N at turn t, it disappears at the end of turn t + N - 1? Let's clarify.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So at turn t, life span N means it will disappear after N more turns, so it's available from turn t to turn t + N - 1 inclusive? For example, if N=1 at turn t, it disappears after this turn, so it can be eaten only on turn t if head is on it this turn.\n> \n> Standard way: if life span is N at turn t, it decreases by 1 each turn, so at turn t, countdown is N; turn t+1, countdown N-1; ... turn t + N -1, countdown 1; then at turn t + N, it disappears. So it can be eaten from turn t to turn t + N -1.\n> \n> For (3,5) at turn 5: life span 5, so available from turn 5 to turn 9 (since 5 + 5 -1 =9).\n> \n> Similarly:\n> \n> - (3,5): available turns 5 to 9\n> \n> - (6,6): life span 5, available turns 5 to 9\n> \n> - (6,4): life span 6, available turns 5 to 10 (5 + 6 -1 =10)\n> \n> - (3,2): life span 9, available turns 5 to 13 (5 + 9 -1 =13)\n> \n> Now, snake is at [(5,4), (4,4)], head at (5,4), moving right. So possible moves from here: U, D, L, R, but with constraints.\n> \n> Current direction is R, so I cannot move left (opposite direction) on the next turn. So from (5,4), possible moves:\n> \n> - Up: to (5,5)\n> \n> - Down: to (5,3)\n> \n> - Right: to (6,4)\n> \n> - Left: to (4,4), but (4,4) is the body, and since snake is only two segments, moving left to (4,4) might be okay because the tail will move away? Let's see.\n> \n> Rule: \"No instant reverse\": Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn. Current direction is R, so moving L is reverse, not allowed. So I cannot move left.\n> \n> Also, collisions: moving into a wall or body kills, except that moving into the tail cell is okay if the tail moves away. Since snake has only two segments, head at (5,4), tail at (4,4). If I move left to (4,4), that would be where the tail is. But since the tail will move forward when the head moves, it should be okay. Rule says: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So for a two-segment snake, moving to the tail position is safe because the tail moves, so no collision.\n> \n> But in this case, moving left is reverse, which is not allowed because of the no instant reverse rule. So I cannot move left.\n> \n> Therefore, possible actions: U, D, R.\n> \n> Now, let's see what each move leads to.\n> \n> First, move right to (6,4): (6,4) has food! Food at (6,4) with value +1, life span 6.\n> \n> If I move right to (6,4), I eat the food there, since head moves onto it. Then snake grows, so new positions: head at (6,4), body at (5,4), and tail was (4,4) but since it grows, segments become [(6,4), (5,4), (4,4)]? When snake eats, it grows after moving, so:\n> \n> - Before move: positions [(5,4), (4,4)]\n> \n> - Move head to (6,4), which has food, so eat it. Then tail doesn't move, so new positions: head at (6,4), and body segments: (5,4) and (4,4) stays, so [(6,4), (5,4), (4,4)]\n> \n> Yes.\n> \n> But (6,4) is the new head, and it's on the food cell.\n> \n> Now, is there any danger? Tail is at (4,4), not adjacent to head yet.\n> \n> Head at (6,4), tail at (4,4), not adjacent.\n> \n> Also, walls: border walls at x=0,7 y=0,7, so (6,4) is within bounds, x=6<7, y=4 between 0 and 7.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (3,6), not relevant.\n> \n> So moving right seems safe and gets food immediately.\n> \n> But I need to think 5+ turns ahead. Also, there might be risks or better options.\n> \n> Other moves: Up to (5,5). (5,5) is empty? No food there, I think. Food positions are (3,5), (6,6), (6,4), (3,2). So (5,5) no food. Moving up: to (5,5), no eat, so snake moves: head to (5,5), tail moves from (4,4) to? When no eat, head moves to new position, tail moves forward, so positions become [(5,5), (5,4)] since tail was at (4,4), but after head moves to (5,5), the body segment (4,4) becomes the new tail position? Snake positions: before move, head (5,4), body (4,4). After move to (5,5) no eat: head moves to (5,5), the body segment that was at (5,4) is now part of body, and tail at (4,4) is left, so new positions: [(5,5), (5,4)] because the segment that was head is now body at (5,4), and the previous body at (4,4) is gone since tail moves away.\n> \n> Standard snake: when no eat, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, tail is removed.\n> \n> So from [(5,4), (4,4)]:\n> \n> - Move to (5,5): head to (5,5), then the body segment that was at (5,4) is still there but now it's the body, and the tail at (4,4) is removed. So new positions: [(5,5), (5,4)]\n> \n> Similarly, move down to (5,3): no food, so [(5,3), (5,4)]\n> \n> Move right to (6,4): with eat, so [(6,4), (5,4), (4,4)]\n> \n> Now, back to choices.\n> \n> If I move right, I get food at (6,4), snake grows to length 3.\n> \n> But let's see the future.\n> \n> I need to maximize score and survive.\n> \n> Food at (6,4) has life span 6, available until turn 10, but if I eat it now at turn 5, it's gone.\n> \n> Similarly, other food.\n> \n> Also, I should consider the tail reward danger, but not applicable yet.\n> \n> Now, let's list all food:\n> \n> - (3,5): at (3,5), which is left and up from current (5,4)\n> \n> - (6,6): at (6,6), up and right from (5,4)\n> \n> - (6,4): at (6,4), right from (5,4)\n> \n> - (3,2): at (3,2), left and down\n> \n> Since head is at (5,4), and direction R.\n> \n> If I move right to (6,4), I eat it immediately.\n> \n> Then at turn 6, head at (6,4), with body at (5,4) and (4,4).\n> \n> Direction: since I moved right, new head direction is R.\n> \n> Possible moves from (6,4): U to (6,5), D to (6,3), L to (5,4), but (5,4) is body? Positions: head (6,4), body (5,4) and (4,4). So (5,4) is occupied by body.\n> \n> If I move left to (5,4), it's the body segment, which is not the tail; the tail is at (4,4). Moving to (5,4) would cause collision because it's a body segment, not tail.\n> \n> Rule: body collision if head touches any body segment except the tail cell if it moves away.\n> \n> Here, (5,4) is the segment just behind head, so moving left to (5,4) would collide with body.\n> \n> Also, moving left is reverse? Current direction after move to (6,4) is R, so moving L is reverse, not allowed anyway.\n> \n> So from (6,4), direction R, cannot move L (reverse).\n> \n> Possible: U to (6,5), D to (6,3), R to (7,4) but x=7 is wall! Border wall x=7, so (7,4) is out of bounds, wall, cannot move there.\n> \n> y=0 and y=7 also walls, but (6,4) to (6,5) or (6,3) should be fine, y=5 and y=3 within 0 to 7.\n> \n> But R to (7,4) is wall, not possible.\n> \n> So from (6,4), possible moves: U to (6,5), D to (6,3), or L to (5,4) but L is reverse and also body collision, so not possible.\n> \n> Only U or D.\n> \n> Now, if I go U to (6,5), no food there, so snake moves: head to (6,5), body: (6,4) and (5,4), tail at (4,4) moves?

It's turn 5, and the grid has walls. Border walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Also, an internal obstacle at (3,6). So, the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls block movement.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (5,4), body at (4,4). So, the snake is only two segments long right now. Head direction is right, meaning it was moving to the right to get to (5,4) from (4,4). Since it's moving right, the current direction is R.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (3,5) with life span 5, value +1 (positive food)\n> \n> - (6,6) with life span 5, value +1\n> \n> - (6,4) with life span 6, value +1\n> \n> - (3,2) with life span 9, value +1\n> \n> All food is positive, no negative food mentioned. Value is +1 for all, and they all increase length when eaten.\n> \n> Life span: for (3,5), life span 5 at turn 5, so it disappears after 5 turns, meaning if not eaten by turn 10, it's gone. Similarly, (6,6) life span 5, disappears at turn 10; (6,4) life span 6, disappears at turn 11; (3,2) life span 9, disappears at turn 14.\n> \n> Current turn is 5, so:\n> \n> - (3,5): disappears at turn 5 + 5 = turn 10? Life span is the number of turns it remains, including the current turn. So if life span is N at turn t, it disappears at the end of turn t + N - 1? Let's clarify.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So at turn t, life span N means it will disappear after N more turns, so it's available from turn t to turn t + N - 1 inclusive? For example, if N=1 at turn t, it disappears after this turn, so it can be eaten only on turn t if head is on it this turn.\n> \n> Standard way: if life span is N at turn t, it decreases by 1 each turn, so at turn t, countdown is N; turn t+1, countdown N-1; ... turn t + N -1, countdown 1; then at turn t + N, it disappears. So it can be eaten from turn t to turn t + N -1.\n> \n> For (3,5) at turn 5: life span 5, so available from turn 5 to turn 9 (since 5 + 5 -1 =9).\n> \n> Similarly:\n> \n> - (3,5): available turns 5 to 9\n> \n> - (6,6): life span 5, available turns 5 to 9\n> \n> - (6,4): life span 6, available turns 5 to 10 (5 + 6 -1 =10)\n> \n> - (3,2): life span 9, available turns 5 to 13 (5 + 9 -1 =13)\n> \n> Now, snake is at [(5,4), (4,4)], head at (5,4), moving right. So possible moves from here: U, D, L, R, but with constraints.\n> \n> Current direction is R, so I cannot move left (opposite direction) on the next turn. So from (5,4), possible moves:\n> \n> - Up: to (5,5)\n> \n> - Down: to (5,3)\n> \n> - Right: to (6,4)\n> \n> - Left: to (4,4), but (4,4) is the body, and since snake is only two segments, moving left to (4,4) might be okay because the tail will move away? Let's see.\n> \n> Rule: \"No instant reverse\": Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn. Current direction is R, so moving L is reverse, not allowed. So I cannot move left.\n> \n> Also, collisions: moving into a wall or body kills, except that moving into the tail cell is okay if the tail moves away. Since snake has only two segments, head at (5,4), tail at (4,4). If I move left to (4,4), that would be where the tail is. But since the tail will move forward when the head moves, it should be okay. Rule says: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So for a two-segment snake, moving to the tail position is safe because the tail moves, so no collision.\n> \n> But in this case, moving left is reverse, which is not allowed because of the no instant reverse rule. So I cannot move left.\n> \n> Therefore, possible actions: U, D, R.\n> \n> Now, let's see what each move leads to.\n> \n> First, move right to (6,4): (6,4) has food! Food at (6,4) with value +1, life span 6.\n> \n> If I move right to (6,4), I eat the food there, since head moves onto it. Then snake grows, so new positions: head at (6,4), body at (5,4), and tail was (4,4) but since it grows, segments become [(6,4), (5,4), (4,4)]? When snake eats, it grows after moving, so:\n> \n> - Before move: positions [(5,4), (4,4)]\n> \n> - Move head to (6,4), which has food, so eat it. Then tail doesn't move, so new positions: head at (6,4), and body segments: (5,4) and (4,4) stays, so [(6,4), (5,4), (4,4)]\n> \n> Yes.\n> \n> But (6,4) is the new head, and it's on the food cell.\n> \n> Now, is there any danger? Tail is at (4,4), not adjacent to head yet.\n> \n> Head at (6,4), tail at (4,4), not adjacent.\n> \n> Also, walls: border walls at x=0,7 y=0,7, so (6,4) is within bounds, x=6<7, y=4 between 0 and 7.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (3,6), not relevant.\n> \n> So moving right seems safe and gets food immediately.\n> \n> But I need to think 5+ turns ahead. Also, there might be risks or better options.\n> \n> Other moves: Up to (5,5). (5,5) is empty? No food there, I think. Food positions are (3,5), (6,6), (6,4), (3,2). So (5,5) no food. Moving up: to (5,5), no eat, so snake moves: head to (5,5), tail moves from (4,4) to? When no eat, head moves to new position, tail moves forward, so positions become [(5,5), (5,4)] since tail was at (4,4), but after head moves to (5,5), the body segment (4,4) becomes the new tail position? Snake positions: before move, head (5,4), body (4,4). After move to (5,5) no eat: head moves to (5,5), the body segment that was at (5,4) is now part of body, and tail at (4,4) is left, so new positions: [(5,5), (5,4)] because the segment that was head is now body at (5,4), and the previous body at (4,4) is gone since tail moves away.\n> \n> Standard snake: when no eat, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, tail is removed.\n> \n> So from [(5,4), (4,4)]:\n> \n> - Move to (5,5): head to (5,5), then the body segment that was at (5,4) is still there but now it's the body, and the tail at (4,4) is removed. So new positions: [(5,5), (5,4)]\n> \n> Similarly, move down to (5,3): no food, so [(5,3), (5,4)]\n> \n> Move right to (6,4): with eat, so [(6,4), (5,4), (4,4)]\n> \n> Now, back to choices.\n> \n> If I move right, I get food at (6,4), snake grows to length 3.\n> \n> But let's see the future.\n> \n> I need to maximize score and survive.\n> \n> Food at (6,4) has life span 6, available until turn 10, but if I eat it now at turn 5, it's gone.\n> \n> Similarly, other food.\n> \n> Also, I should consider the tail reward danger, but not applicable yet.\n> \n> Now, let's list all food:\n> \n> - (3,5): at (3,5), which is left and up from current (5,4)\n> \n> - (6,6): at (6,6), up and right from (5,4)\n> \n> - (6,4): at (6,4), right from (5,4)\n> \n> - (3,2): at (3,2), left and down\n> \n> Since head is at (5,4), and direction R.\n> \n> If I move right to (6,4), I eat it immediately.\n> \n> Then at turn 6, head at (6,4), with body at (5,4) and (4,4).\n> \n> Direction: since I moved right, new head direction is R.\n> \n> Possible moves from (6,4): U to (6,5), D to (6,3), L to (5,4), but (5,4) is body? Positions: head (6,4), body (5,4) and (4,4). So (5,4) is occupied by body.\n> \n> If I move left to (5,4), it's the body segment, which is not the tail; the tail is at (4,4). Moving to (5,4) would cause collision because it's a body segment, not tail.\n> \n> Rule: body collision if head touches any body segment except the tail cell if it moves away.\n> \n> Here, (5,4) is the segment just behind head, so moving left to (5,4) would collide with body.\n> \n> Also, moving left is reverse?

It's turn 7. The grid has walls at the borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. There's also an internal obstacle at (3,6). So, the playable area is from x=1 to x=6 and y=1 to y=6, except where blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (6,5), then body at (6,4), and tail at (5,4). So the snake is three segments long.

Life span decreases each turn, including the current one. So for (3,5), life span 3 means it disappears after turn 7 + 3 - 1? Let me clarify life span.\n> \n> The problem says: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So at turn t, if life_span is L, it will disappear after L turns, meaning it will be gone at the start of turn t + L. For example, at turn 7, life span 3 means it will disappear after 3 turns, so after turn 9, it's gone at turn 10. But since countdown decreases every turn, at turn 7, it has 3 turns left; at turn 8, 2 left; at turn 9, 1 left; gone at turn 10. Similarly for others.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan an action sequence for at least 5 turns ahead.

But since direction is U, I cannot move D (down) immediately because of no instant reverse. So forbidden move is D. Allowed: U, L, R.\n> \n> Now, the grid: walls at borders, so x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6. Obstacle at (3,6). (3,6) is on the top row since y=6 is the top border? y=0 and y=7 are borders, so y=1 to y=6 is inside. y=0 and y=7 are walls, so cells with y=1 to 6 are playable, but y=6 is the top row, adjacent to wall at y=7? No: walls are at coordinates where x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7, so for example, (0,y) for any y, (7,y) for any y, (x,0) for any x, (x,7) for any x. And internal obstacle at (3,6).\n> \n> (3,6): x=3, y=6.

Then snake grows, so new positions: head at (6,6), then the body: since I ate food, the tail doesn't move, so new segments: head (6,6), then previous head (6,5) becomes body, and (6,4) becomes body, and tail (5,4) stays, so snake becomes [(6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4)]. Length 4.\n> \n> - But need to check if (6,6) is safe. Currently, no body there, and not wall, so ok.\n> \n> - However, there's a risk: \"Tail Reward Danger\". If head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills. But here, tail is at (5,4), head at (6,5), not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing an edge, so (6,5) and (5,4) are not adjacent; they are diagonal? Coordinates: (6,5) and (5,4): delta x=1, delta y=1, so diagonal, not adjacent. Adjacent would be same x or y, differ by 1.\n> \n> - Head (6,5), tail (5,4): not adjacent. After moving to (6,6), head (6,6), tail (5,4), not adjacent. So no immediate danger.\n> \n> - But (6,6) is at corner? x=6, y=6, so only two moves possible: down or left? Let's see.\n> \n> From (6,6), possible moves: U to (6,7), but y=7 is wall, invalid. D to (6,5), which will be body after move. L to (5,6), R to (7,6) invalid. So only possible moves: D or L.\n> \n> D to (6,5): but after eating, (6,5) is body, so moving there would cause collision, since body segment is there.\n> \n> After turn 7, if I move U to (6,6), snake positions: head (6,6), body (6,5), body (6,4), tail (5,4).\n> \n> So at turn 8, from (6,6), I can move:\n> \n> - U: (6,7) wall, invalid.\n> \n> - D: (6,5) but (6,5) is occupied by body, so collision.\n> \n> - L: (5,6)\n> \n> - R: (7,6) wall, invalid.\n> \n> So only possible move is L to (5,6).\n> \n> (5,6) is empty? Currently, no food or obstacle there. Obstacle is only (3,6), so (5,6) should be free.\n> \n> So if I move U at turn 7, I must move L at turn 8 to (5,6).\n> \n> - Then at turn 9, head at (5,6), etc.\n> \n> - But I ate food, so I grew, which is good, but now I'm in a position where I had only one choice at turn 8, which might be risky later.\n> \n> 2. L: move left to (5,5)\n> \n> - (5,5) is not a food position? Foods are at (3,5), (6,6), (3,2), (5,1). (5,5) has no food mentioned, so empty.\n> \n> - Move to (5,5), no food eaten, so snake moves: head to (5,5), then body to previous head (6,5), tail to (6,4)? Standard snake movement: when no food, head moves to new position, each segment moves to the next, tail moves away.\n> \n> Positions: current [(6,5), (6,4), (5,4)]\n> \n> After move L to (5,5): head to (5,5), then the body: the first body segment moves to where head was, (6,5), but since head was at (6,5), and it moves to (5,5), so body segments follow: the segment that was at (6,4) moves to (6,5)? Let's index.\n> \n> Snake segments: index 0: head (6,5), index 1: body (6,4), index 2: tail (5,4)\n> \n> After moving head to (5,5), the new head is (5,5), then the body segments: segment 1 moves to where head was, (6,5), but (6,5) is now empty? No: when head moves, the body follows, so segment 1 moves to the previous position of segment 0, which is (6,5). But (6,5) is now the new position for segment 1? I think I'm confusing.\n> \n> Standard: after move without eating, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so segment 1 moves to old position of segment 0, segment 2 moves to old position of segment 1, and the tail cell is vacated.\n> \n> So: new positions: head (5,5), segment 1 at old head (6,5), segment 2 at old segment 1 (6,4).

Also, food life spans: (3,5) has life span 3 at turn 7, so it will disappear after 3 turns, meaning gone at turn 10? Let's calculate.\n> \n> At turn 7, life span 3: countdown starts from 3, decreases each turn. After turn 7, it has 2 left?

Value is +1 for all.\n> \n> Life_span: for (3,5) and (6,6), life_span 2, meaning they disappear after 2 turns, including current turn. Since current turn is t=8, after turn 8, life_span decreases to 1, then after turn 9, it disappears. So (3,5) and (6,6) will disappear after turn 9 if not eaten.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,2) life_span 6, so disappears after turn 13, and (5,1) after turn 16.\n> \n> I need to plan actions for at least 5 turns ahead, from turn 8 onwards.\n> \n> Current head position: (5,5)\n> \n> Possible moves: U (up, to (5,6)), D (down, to (5,4)), L (left, to (4,5)), R (right, to (6,5))\n> \n> But I have to consider movement constraints. Head direction is L, so I cannot move right (R) immediately because that would be opposite direction. Rule: \"No instant reverse\": Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn. So from direction L, I cannot move R. So possible moves: U, D, L.\n> \n> Now, check for collisions or walls.\n> \n> First, let's list all possible cells:\n> \n> - U: (5,6) – is this a wall? Border walls: y=7 is top, y=0 bottom, x=0 left, x=7 right. (5,6): x=5, y=6. y=6 is not 0 or 7, so not border wall. Internal obstacle at (3,6), not (5,6). So (5,6) is free? But is it occupied by snake?\n> \n> Snake positions: (5,5) head, (6,5) body, (6,4) tail. So (5,6) is not occupied by snake. Is it a wall? No, walls are only at borders and (3,6). So (5,6) should be free.\n> \n> Similarly, D: (5,4) – not border wall, not (3,6), and snake? (5,4) is not in positions, positions are (5,5),(6,5),(6,4). (6,4) is tail, but (5,4) is empty. So free.\n> \n> L: (4,5) – similarly, free.\n> \n> R: (6,5) – but (6,5) is the body segment. If I move right, head to (6,5), which is currently occupied by the body. But rule says: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> Here, (6,5) is not the tail; it's the second segment. Tail is (6,4). So moving to (6,5) would cause collision with body, death.\n> \n> Also, since head direction is L, moving R is opposite, so not allowed anyway.\n> \n> So possible moves from (5,5): U, D, L.\n> \n> Now, U: (5,6)\n> \n> D: (5,4)\n> \n> L: (4,5)\n> \n> I need to think ahead multiple turns.\n> \n> First, let's see the food locations.\n> \n> Food at:\n> \n> - (3,5): value 1, life_span 2. So must be eaten by turn 9, or it disappears.\n> \n> - (6,6): value 1, life_span 2, same.\n> \n> - (3,2): value 1, life_span 6, plenty of time.\n> \n> - (5,1): value 1, life_span 9, plenty of time.\n> \n> But (3,5) is close, at (3,5), which is left of current head (5,5). (5,5) to (3,5) is two steps left: (5,5) to (4,5) to (3,5).\n> \n> Similarly, (6,6) is at (6,6), which is up-right from head. Head at (5,5), (6,6) is one right and one up, but since we can only move one step, it would take at least two moves: e.g., right then up, but right is not possible now because of direction and body.\n> \n> Head direction L, so moving right not possible. To reach (6,6), from (5,5), I could go up to (5,6), then right to (6,6). But (6,6) has food, and life_span 2, so it can be eaten on turn 9 at latest.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,5) can be eaten on turn 9 or 10? Turn 8: current, if I move left to (4,5) on turn 8, then to (3,5) on turn 9, that would eat it on turn 9, before it disappears after turn 9.\n> \n> Life_span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 8, life_span 2, after turn 8, it becomes 1, after turn 9, it becomes 0 and disappears. So to eat it, head must be on the food cell on turn 8 or 9.\n> \n> Similarly for (6,6).\n> \n> Now, also, the tail is at (6,4), and if I eat food, snake grows, so tail doesn't move, but since all food is positive, eating increases length.\n> \n> But there's a danger: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> Currently, tail is at (6,4). Head is at (5,5), which is not adjacent to (6,4). Adjacent means sharing a side, so (5,5) and (6,4) are diagonal, not adjacent. Adjacent would be same x or same y, differ by 1 in one coordinate.\n> \n> (5,5) and (6,5) are adjacent horizontally, but (6,5) is body, not tail. Tail is (6,4).\n> \n> (5,5) and (6,4): x differs by 1, y differs by 1, so diagonal, not adjacent. Therefore, no immediate tail danger.\n> \n> Now, to plan sequence: I need to choose actions for turn 8,9,10,... at least 5 turns, but since the answer format says \"action sequence\" for multiple turns, I should specify a sequence.\n> \n> But I have to think 5+ turns ahead, so plan for several moves.\n> \n> First, options for turn 8:\n> \n> - Move U to (5,6)\n> \n> - Move D to (5,4)\n> \n> - Move L to (4,5)\n> \n> If I move L to (4,5), that gets me closer to (3,5) food. From (4,5), I could go to (3,5) on turn 9 to eat it.\n> \n> But let's see the grid and obstacles.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (3,6), which is above (3,5).\n> \n> (3,6) is wall, so cannot go there.\n> \n> Now, if I go to (4,5) on turn 8, then turn 9, from (4,5), possible moves: U to (4,6), D to (4,4), L to (3,5), R to (5,5). But R to (5,5) is where the body was, but on turn 9, the snake has moved.\n> \n> Let's simulate snake movement.\n> \n> Current turn 8: snake positions [(5,5), (6,5), (6,4)]\n> \n> After move, depending on action.\n> \n> If I move L to (4,5) on turn 8:\n> \n> New head position: (4,5)\n> \n> Then the body: since head moved, the body follows: the first body segment moves to where head was, so (6,5) moves to (5,5), and (6,4) moves to where (6,5) was? Standard snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> So positions: after move, new head at (4,5), then the segment that was head becomes body, so (5,5) is now first body segment, then (6,5) is second body, and tail (6,4) moves to where the last body was? Let's think.\n> \n> Initial positions: index 0: head (5,5), index 1: body (6,5), index 2: tail (6,4)\n> \n> After moving head to new position, say new_head.\n> \n> Then new positions: new_head, then position of old head (5,5), then position of old body (6,5). The tail (6,4) is not moved unless we eat food; if no food eaten, tail is removed, but since we eat food only when head on food, and we don't eat on move, but when head moves to a cell with food, it eats it, and then the tail doesn't move, so snake grows.\n> \n> In this case, for turn 8, if I move to (4,5), which has no food? Food positions: (3,5), (6,6), (3,2), (5,1). (4,5) has no food, so if I move to (4,5), no food eaten, so snake moves: head to (4,5), body segments: the first body segment moves to where head was, (5,5), and the tail segment moves to where the first body was, (6,5). But since there are three segments, after head moves to (4,5), the new body is at (5,5) (old head), and the tail moves to (6,5) (old body position). Old tail (6,4) is no longer part of snake; it moves away.\n> \n> So after turn 8 move L to (4,5):\n> \n> - Head: (4,5)\n> \n> - Body: (5,5)  // old head\n> \n> - Tail: (6,5)  // old body, since tail moved to where body was\n> \n> Old tail (6,4) is now free.\n> \n> Similarly, if I move U to (5,6):\n> \n> Head to (5,6), body to (5,5), tail to (6,5)\n> \n> Or D to (5,4): head to (5,4), body to (5,5), tail to (6,5)\n> \n> Back to turn 8 choice.\n> \n> If I move L to (4,5) on turn 8, no food eaten.\n> \n> Then turn 9: from (4,5), possible moves: U, D, L, R? But current head position (4,5), head direction: since I moved left to (4,5), new direction is L.\n> \n> Possible moves: U to (4,6), D to (4,4), L to (3,5), R to (5,5)\n> \n> Now, (3,5) has food, and life_span 2 at turn 8, after turn 8 it becomes life_span 1, so on turn 9, if I move to (3,5), I can eat it.\n> \n> If I move L to (3,5) on turn 9, I eat the food, so snake grows: head to (3,5), and since food eaten, tail does not move, so new positions: head (3,5), body (4,5), body (5,5), and tail remains, but since we ate, length increases, so the old tail stays.\n> \n> Before move: positions [(4,5), (5,5), (6,5)] after turn 8.\n> \n> Turn 9: move head to (3,5), which has food, so eat it. New head: (3,5), then body segments: old head (4,5) becomes first body, old body (5,5) becomes second body, and since food eaten, we add a new segment at the tail position, so tail stays at (6,5)? No.\n> \n> When food eaten, the tail does not move, so the snake gains a segment. So after move, head at new position, body segments same as before, but tail doesn't advance, so we have an extra segment.\n> \n> Initial before move: segments: A (head), B, C (tail)\n> \n> After move without eating: new head at new, B moves to A's position, C moves to B's position, C old position free.\n> \n> After move with eating: new head at new, B moves to A's position, C stays where it is, and we add a new segment at C's position? No.\n> \n> Typically in snake, when you eat, the tail doesn't move, so the new tail is the old tail, and a new segment is added where the tail was or something. I think I have confusion.\n> \n> Standard: when head moves to a cell without food, tail moves forward, so snake same length.\n> \n> When head moves to food, tail does not move, so snake grows by one, with the new tail being the old tail, and the segment before it now connects.\n> \n> In terms of positions: suppose before move: positions [H, B1, B2, ..., T]\n> \n> After move to empty cell: new positions [new_H, H, B1, B2, ...] and T is removed, so [new_H, H, B1, B2, ...] up to the second last, so length same.\n> \n> After move to food: new positions [new_H, H, B1, B2, ..., T] so T is still there, and new segment added, so positions [new_H, H, B1, B2, ..., T] which is one longer.\n> \n> In this case, for turn 9: if I move to (3,5) and eat food.\n> \n> Before turn 9 move: positions [(4,5), (5,5), (6,5)] with head at (4,5)\n> \n> Move to (3,5): eat food, so new head (3,5), then old head (4,5) becomes body, old body (5,5) becomes next body, and since food eaten, tail (6,5) does not move, so it remains. So new positions: [(3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5)] length 4.\n> \n> Similarly, if no food, after move, it would be [(3,5), (4,5), (5,5)] and (6,5) free.\n> \n> But here with food, it grows.\n> \n> Back to turn 8.\n> \n> If I move L to (4,5) on turn 8, no food.\n> \n> Then turn 9, I can move L to (3,5) to eat food.\n> \n> But is (3,5) safe? (3,5) is not wall, and after moving, the body will be at (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), so head at (3,5), no collision.\n> \n> But (3,5) has wall above at (3,6), but that's fine.\n> \n> After eating, snake is longer.\n> \n> Now, another food at (6,6), which is close but not reachable immediately.\n> \n> Life_span 2, so must be eaten by turn 9.\n> \n> If I go to (4,5) on turn 8, on turn 9 I go to (3,5), I eat that food, but I don't eat (6,6), which might disappear.\n> \n> (6,6) can be eaten on turn 9 if I can get there.\n> \n> But from current position (5,5), to reach (6,6), I need to go up or right, but right not possible.\n> \n> If on turn 8 I move U to (5,6), then (5,6) has no food, so after move: head (5,6), body (5,5), tail (6,5)\n> \n> Then turn 9, from (5,6), I can move R to (6,6), which has food, so eat it.\n> \n> Similarly, life_span 2, eat on turn 9.\n> \n> If I move D to (5,4) on turn 8, then I go away from both foods.\n> \n> (5,4) no food, after move: head (5,4), body (5,5), tail (6,5)\n> \n> Then I can go to other places, but (3,5) and (6,6) might disappear soon.\n> \n> So for immediate food, I have two options:\n> \n> - Go left to get (3,5) on turn 9\n> \n> - Go up to get (6,6) on turn 9\n> \n> Both are possible and can be eaten before they expire.\n> \n> But I need to think long-term, survival and other foods.\n> \n> Also, there is food at (3,2) and (5,1), which have longer life, but I should consider the grid.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (3,6), which is above (3,5).\n> \n> After eating one food, snake is longer, which might make it harder to maneuver.\n> \n> But currently snake is short, length 3.\n> \n> Also, walls around.\n> \n> Now, let's consider the sequence.\n> \n> First, if I go for (3,5):\n> \n> Turn 8: move L to (4,5)\n> \n> Turn 9: move L to (3,5), eat food.

Let's see.\n> \n> Standard snake: when you eat, the head moves to the food cell, and a new segment is added at the end, so tail grows.\n> \n> So from [(4,5), (5,5), (6,5)], if head moves to (3,5), then new head at (3,5), and tail stays, so body is (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), so positions: [(3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5)].\n> \n> Length was 3, now 4.\n> \n> Now, but (3,5) is at x=3,y=5.

Walls are y=0 and y=7, so y=1 to y=6 are playable, y=6 is the top row, but not wall, since walls are at y=0 and y=7.\n> \n> Similarly, x=1 to x=6.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (3,6), which is different.\n> \n> So (4,6) is free? Is there food? Food is at (3,5), (6,6), (3,2), (5,1).

No.\n> \n> When snake moves, the head moves to new position, then each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead. So tail is removed if no food eaten.\n> \n> Specifically: if head moves to a cell with food, length increases, so tail doesn't move, new head position added. If no food, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so tail is removed.\n> \n> In this case, at turn 10, snake positions: head (3,5), body (4,5), (5,5), tail (6,5).\n> \n> After move, say to (2,5) if L, and if no food at (2,5), then new positions: head (2,5), body: (3,5) from old head, (4,5) from old body, (5,5) from old body, and tail (6,5) is gone. So new snake: [(2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5)]\n> \n> Similarly, if move D to (3,4), no food, then new snake: [(3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5)] and tail (6,5) gone.\n> \n> Now, back to reaching (2,6).\n> \n> (2,6) is at turn 10, life span 10, so disappears at turn 20.\n> \n> If I go to (2,5) at turn 10, then at turn 11, I can move to (2,6) since U from (2,5) to (2,6).\n> \n> (2,6) is not occupied by body, and not wall, so I can move there and eat the food.\n> \n> But I need to check if there's tail reward danger.\n> \n> Tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> In this case, when I eat food at (2,6), the tail doesn't grow immediately? When I eat food, the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move; a new segment is added at head.\n> \n> Let's clarify.\n> \n> When head moves to a food cell:\n> \n> - If it's positive food, value +1, length increases by 1. So head moves to food, new head position, and the tail stays where it is, so the snake grows by one segment.\n> \n> Then in the next move, the tail will move as usual if no food eaten.\n> \n> Tail reward danger: suppose the head is adjacent to the tail, and on the tail cell there is food. If the head moves to the tail cell to eat the food, but since the tail is there, moving head to tail cell would cause collision, because the tail is a body part.\n> \n> But the rule says: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\" But that's when not eating food; when moving to a cell without food, you can move to tail position because tail moves away.\n> \n> But when eating food, if the food is on the tail cell, and head moves there, then:\n> \n> - Head moves to tail cell.\n> \n> - Since food is eaten, the snake grows, so the tail does not move; it stays, and a new segment is added at head. But the tail is still there, so now head and tail are at the same position? That would be collision.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n> \n> Specifically: when you eat the food on the tail cell, the tail doesn't move, so after eating, head is at the food cell (which was tail), and the tail is still there, but since snake grows, the old tail position becomes part of body, and head is on it, so collision.\n> \n> Moreover, since head and body are at same cell, instant death.\n> \n> So, in this case, for (2,6), if I move to it, and it's not the tail, it should be fine.\n> \n> Currently, tail is at (6,5), not at (2,6), so no issue.\n> \n> Now, if I go to (2,5) at turn 10, then at turn 11 move U to (2,6), I eat the food at (2,6).\n> \n> Then snake grows: new head at (2,6), and body includes the previous positions. Previous positions at turn 10 after move to (2,5): snake [(2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5)] head (2,5), body (3,5), (4,5), tail (5,5)? After moving to (2,5) at turn 10, no food eaten, so snake is [(2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5)] with head (2,5), tail (5,5).\n> \n> Then at turn 11, move U to (2,6), which has food, so eat it, snake grows: new positions: head (2,6), then body: (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5) so snake length 5 now: [(2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5)]\n> \n> Tail at (5,5).\n> \n> Now, this is fine, no collision.\n> \n> But (2,6) has life span 10, at turn 10, so at turn 11 it's still there, life span decreases to 9 at turn 11? Life span decreases every turn including current, but when we say \"at turn t\", life span is given, so at turn 10, life span 10, meaning it has 10 turns left including turn 10, so after turn 10, at start of turn 11, life span is 9, and so on, disappearing when life span 0.\n> \n> But since I eat it at turn 11, it's fine.\n> \n> Now, if I do this, I eat (2,6) at turn 11.\n> \n> But I need to think about other food.\n> \n> (3,2) has life span 5, so it will disappear at turn 15, meaning I have until turn 14 to eat it, since at turn 15 it's gone.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,1) life span 7, disappear at turn 17.\n> \n> Now, after eating (2,6), snake is at [(2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5)]\n> \n> Head at (2,6), direction U (since moved up).\n> \n> Then I need to go down for other food.\n> \n> But there is obstacle at (3,6), which is adjacent to (2,6) and (3,5)? (3,6) is east of (2,6) and north of (3,5).\n> \n> From (2,6), possible moves: U, D, L, R? Direction is U, so cannot move D (reverse), can move U, L, R.\n> \n> U to (2,7): but y=7 is wall, so invalid.\n> \n> D to (2,5): but (2,5) is the body segment, since snake is at (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), etc. (2,5) is the second segment, so moving to (2,5) would be body collision, deadly.\n> \n> L to (1,6): x=1, y=6, not border? Borders are x=0,x=7,y=0,y=7, so x=1 is ok, but need to check if free. Currently, no snake there, not wall, so possible.\n> \n> R to (3,6): but (3,6) is internal obstacle, wall, so invalid.\n> \n> So from (2,6) after eating, only possible move is L to (1,6), since U and R invalid, D to body.\n> \n> So must move L to (1,6).\n> \n> Then at turn 12, head to (1,6), direction L.\n> \n> Then snake: if no food at (1,6), which there isn't, so move head to (1,6), body: (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), tail (5,5) gone? After eating at turn 11, snake length 5: positions [(2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5)]\n> \n> At turn 12, move to (1,6), no food, so head to (1,6), then body segments move: segment behind head was (2,6) moves to (1,6)? No.\n> \n> Positions: after move, head at (1,6), then the first body segment moves to previous head position (2,6), second body to previous first body position (2,5), third to (3,5), and tail (5,5) is not moved, so removed. Snake becomes [(1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5)] length 4? Original length after growth was 5, but since no food eaten, tail is removed, so length back to 4? No.\n> \n> At turn 11 after eating, length 5: positions index 0: head (2,6), 1: (2,5), 2: (3,5), 3: (4,5), 4: tail (5,5)\n> \n> At turn 12, head moves to (1,6), no food, so new head (1,6), then body segment 1 moves to previous head position (2,6), body segment 2 moves to previous position of segment 1, which was (2,5), body segment 3 moves to previous position of segment 2, which was (3,5), and tail segment 4 was at (5,5), but since no growth, it is removed, not moved. So new positions: head (1,6), body (2,6), (2,5), (3,5) — so snake [(1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5)] length 4, tail at (3,5).\n> \n> Now, from (1,6), direction L, so can move L, U, D, not R.\n> \n> Possible moves: L to (0,6): x=0 is wall, invalid.\n> \n> U to (1,7): y=7 wall, invalid.\n> \n> D to (1,5): is (1,5) free? Not occupied, not wall, so possible.\n> \n> R to (2,6): but (2,6) is now a body segment, so collision if move there.\n> \n> So only possible move is D to (1,5).\n> \n> Then at turn 13, move D to (1,5), head (1,5), direction D.\n> \n> Then and so on.\n> \n> But this path seems to be going left and down, away from other food like (3,2) and (5,1), which have shorter life span.\n> \n> (3,2) disappears at turn 15, so I need to eat it by turn 14.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,1) by turn 16.\n> \n> After going to (1,5), I might be able to go down, but it's getting tight.\n> \n> Moreover, from (1,5), I can move to (1,4), (1,3), etc to go down, but it might take time.\n> \n> Turn 10 to turn 14 is 4 turns, but from (1,5) to (3,2) is not direct.\n> \n> Perhaps moving down directly is better.\n> \n> Alternative: at turn 10, move D to (3,4).\n> \n> Then head at (3,4), direction D.\n> \n> Then I can go down towards (3,2).\n> \n> From (3,4), possible moves: D (down), L (left), R (right), not U (reverse).\n> \n> D to (3,3): free, not occupied.\n> \n> L to (2,4): free.\n> \n> R to (4,4): free.\n> \n> (3,2) is at (3,2), so I can go directly down: D to (3,3) at turn 11, then D to (3,2) at turn 12 to eat it.\n> \n> But at turn 12, (3,2) life span: at turn 10, life span 5, so at turn 11, life span 4, at turn 12, life span 3, so it's still there. I can eat at turn 12.\n> \n> Let's see.\n> \n> Turn 10: move D to (3,4). Snake now: head (3,4), body (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), tail (6,5) gone? After move, no food, so snake [(3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5)]\n> \n> Tail at (5,5).\n> \n> Turn 11: move D to (3,3). (3,3) no food, so snake: head (3,3), body (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), tail (5,5) gone? Positions: head to (3,3), body segment 1 to (3,4), segment 2 to (3,5), segment 3 to (4,5), tail removed, so [(3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)]? Length: original after turn 10 move was length 4: head, and three body segments including tail? At turn 10 after move to (3,4), snake positions: (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5) — that's four segments, head and three body, but (5,5) is tail.\n> \n> At turn 11, move to (3,3), no food, head (3,3), body: first body to (3,4), second body to (3,5), third body to (4,5), and tail (5,5) removed. So new snake: [(3,3), (3,4), (3,5)]? Segments: head (3,3), then body at previous head position (3,4), then body at previous position of first body, which was (3,5), and the second body was at (4,5), but since tail removed, we have only three segments? Let's list indices.\n> \n> After turn 10: positions: 0: head (3,4), 1: (3,5), 2: (4,5), 3: tail (5,5)\n> \n> At turn 11, move head to (3,3), no food. New head (3,3). Then segment 1 moves to position of old head, (3,4). Segment 2 moves to position of old segment 1, (3,5). Segment 3 (tail) moves to position of old segment 2, (4,5). Since no food, no growth, so tail is not removed until after move, but the last segment is moved to the position of the previous last segment's position? Standard snake movement: when head moves to new cell, each subsequent segment moves to the position of the segment before it.\n> \n> So for segment i, it moves to the position where segment i-1 was.\n> \n> In this case: new position for segment 0 (head): (3,3)\n> \n> Segment 1 moves to where segment 0 was, which is (3,4)\n> \n> Segment 2 moves to where segment 1 was, which is (3,5)\n> \n> Segment 3 moves to where segment 2 was, which is (4,5)\n> \n> But segment 3 was tail, and since no food, after moving, the tail position is vacated, but in positions, segment 3 is now at (4,5), so snake positions: (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5) — head at (3,3), tail at (4,5).\n> \n> Length 4.\n> \n> Then turn 12: move D to (3,2), which has food. So eat it, snake grows. New head (3,2), and body: (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), so new tail at (4,5). Length 5.\n> \n> Good, I ate (3,2) at turn 12.\n> \n> Now, (3,2) life span was 5 at turn 10, so at turn 12, it has life span 3? At turn 10: life span 5, so after turn 10, life span 4 at turn 11, after turn 11, life span 3 at turn 12, so I eat it on turn 12 with life span 3, fine.\n> \n> Now, I have (5,1) to eat, which is at (5,1), life span 7 at turn 10, so disappear at turn 17.\n> \n> From (3,2) after eating, head at (3,2), direction D (since moved down).\n> \n> Snake positions: [(3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)]\n> \n> Now, (5,1) is at x=5,y=1, so I need to go right and down.\n> \n> From (3,2), possible moves: D, L, R, not U (reverse).\n> \n> D to (3,1): y=1, not wall, should be free.\n> \n> L to (2,2): free.\n> \n> R to (4,2): free.\n> \n> (3,1) is down, then I can go to (4,1), (5,1), etc.\n> \n> But (5,1) is at y=1, x=5.\n> \n> I can go R to (4,2), then D to (4,1), then R to (5,1).\n> \n> Or directly if possible.\n> \n> First, at turn 12, after eating at (3,2), head (3,2), direction D.\n> \n> Turn 13: move R to (4,2)? Direction changed, but possible, since not reverse.\n> \n> Move to (4,2), no food there, so snake moves: head to (4,2), body: segment 1 to (3,2), segment 2 to (3,3), segment 3 to (3,4), segment 4 to (3,5), and tail (4,5) moves to where? Positions: after turn 12: head (3,2), body (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), tail (4,5)\n> \n> At turn 13, move head to (4,2), no food, so new head (4,2), segment 1 to (3,2), segment 2 to (3,3), segment 3 to (3,4), segment 4 to (3,5), and tail (4,5) is not moved; since no growth, it is removed. So new snake: [(4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)] and (3,5) is now part of body? Segment 4 moves to (3,5), but since tail was (4,5), and it's removed, the last segment is at (3,5).\n> \n> Positions: head (4,2), body: (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5) — tail at (3,5).\n> \n> Now head at (4,2), direction R (since moved right from (3,2)).\n> \n> Turn 14: move R to (5,2). (5,2) no food, so head to (5,2), body: (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), tail (3,5) moves to (3,4)? New head (5,2), segment 1 to (4,2), segment 2 to (3,2), segment 3 to (3,3), segment 4 to (3,4), tail removed, so snake: [(5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3)] tail at (3,3).\n> \n> (3,4) is gone.\n> \n> Now, (5,1) is at (5,1), below (5,2).\n> \n> Turn 15: move D to (5,1). (5,1) has food, so eat it. Head to (5,1), snake grows: new positions head (5,1), body (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), so length 5, tail at (3,3).\n> \n> Ate (5,1) at turn 15.\n> \n> Life span of (5,1): at turn 10, life span 7, so at turn 15, life span 2?

So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), but the borders are walls, so the snake can only be in the inner area from (1,1) to (6,6). Also, there's an internal obstacle at (3,6).\n> \n> Internal Obstacles: [(3,6)], so (3,6) is blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (3,4), then (3,5), (4,5), (5,5). So the snake has 4 segments: head at (3,4), body at (3,5), then (4,5), then tail at (5,5).\n> \n> Head direction is D, which is down, meaning the snake was moving down to get to (3,4) from... since positions are given head first, and direction is current head direction, which is D. So from the positions, the head is at (3,4), and it was moving down to get there, I assume. Direction D means it was moving down, so from (3,5) to (3,4)? Positions: [(3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5)]. If head is at (3,4) and direction is D, that means it moved down to (3,4), so previous head was at (3,5) or something? Let's think.\n> \n> Snake positions: index 0 is head, so head at (3,4). Direction is D, meaning it is facing down, so it came from above, from (3,5)? But (3,5) is the second segment, which is the body. The sequence is: position 0: (3,4) head, position 1: (3,5), position 2: (4,5), position 3: (5,5) tail.\n> \n> Since direction is D, and head is at (3,4), it must have moved down from (3,5) to (3,4) on the last move. But (3,5) is now the body, so when it moved down, the head went to (3,4), and the tail was at (5,5), but since it didn't eat, the tail should move, but in this case, the snake has 4 segments, so when it moves, the head moves to a new position, and the tail is removed unless it eats food.\n> \n> But in the positions, after moving down to (3,4), the body segments follow. So from previous state: head was at (3,5), then it moved down to (3,4), so now head is (3,4), and the previous head (3,5) becomes body, and so on. Tail was (5,5), and since no food eaten, tail moves off, but in positions, we have (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5). (4,5) and (5,5) are from before.\n> \n> I should not worry about past; just current state.\n> \n> Head direction D means the last move was down, so from (3,5) to (3,4).\n> \n> Now, food:\n> \n> - (3,2) with value 1, life span 4\n> \n> - (5,1) with value 1, life span 6\n> \n> - (2,6) with value 1, life span 9\n> \n> All food has value 1, so all positive food? Value is given as 1, which is positive since penalty is -1. In the food list: ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 ), so for (3,2,4,1) I think it's (x,y, life_span, value), but in the state it says: (3, 2, 4, 1) – probably (x=3, y=2, life_span=4, value=1)\n> \n> Similarly, (5,1,6,1) : x=5,y=1, life_span=6, value=1\n> \n> (2,6,9,1) : x=2,y=6, life_span=9, value=1\n> \n> All value 1, so all positive food, no negative food here.\n> \n> Life span: for (3,2) it's 4, meaning it will disappear after 4 turns, including current turn? \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so at turn 11, life_span=4, so it will be there for turns 11,12,13,14, and disappear after turn 14, meaning not available on turn 15. Similarly, (5,1) life_span=6, so from turn 11 to 16, disappear after 16. (2,6) life_span=9, turn 11 to 19.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan actions for at least 5 turns ahead, starting from turn 11.\n> \n> Current head position: (3,4)\n> \n> Possible moves: U (up, to (3,5)?), D (down, to (3,3)?), L (left, to (2,4)?), R (right, to (4,4)?)\n> \n> But head direction is D, down, so I cannot move opposite, which is U, up, because \"no instant reverse\". So cannot move U on next turn.\n> \n> Also, need to check for collisions and walls.\n> \n> First, walls: borders are walls, so x=0,7 and y=0,7 are walls. Also internal obstacle at (3,6).\n> \n> So playable grid: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except (3,6) is blocked.\n> \n> (3,6) is an obstacle, so cannot go there.\n> \n> Now, snake body positions: (3,4) head, (3,5), (4,5), (5,5)\n> \n> If I move:\n> \n> - U: to (3,5) – but (3,5) is currently occupied by the body segment. But is that a collision?\n> \n> Rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> (3,5) is the second segment, not the tail. The tail is at (5,5). So if I move to (3,5), it's a body segment, so it would be a collision, because the head touches the body before the tail moves.\n> \n> When the snake moves, the head moves first to a new cell, then if it doesn't eat, the tail moves off. But at the moment of movement, if the head moves to a cell occupied by a body segment, it collides, except if it's the tail and the tail moves away.\n> \n> Specifically: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> But for other body segments, it's a collision.\n> \n> In this case, (3,5) is the neck, not the tail. Tail is (5,5). So moving to (3,5) would cause collision with body.\n> \n> Similarly, moving to other cells.\n> \n> Possible moves from (3,4):\n> \n> - U: (3,5) - occupied by body, collision\n> \n> - D: (3,3) - empty? Need to check\n> \n> - L: (2,4) - empty?\n> \n> - R: (4,4) - empty?\n> \n> Also, cannot move U because it's opposite to current direction D? No, the no instant reverse is only for the next move direction. Current direction is D, so I cannot move U (up) because that would be reverse.\n> \n> \" Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\"\n> \n> Current direction is D, so opposite is U, so I cannot move U. So U is invalid for two reasons: collision and reverse.\n> \n> D: down to (3,3) - is this within bounds? y=3, x=3, grid from 1 to 6, so (3,3) is valid, no wall, and not occupied? Positions: head (3,4), body (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), so (3,3) should be empty.\n> \n> L: left to (2,4) - x=2, y=4, within 1-6, no obstacle, not occupied.\n> \n> R: right to (4,4) - similarly, should be empty.\n> \n> Now, food locations: (3,2), (5,1), (2,6)\n> \n> (3,2) is below, at y=2, x=3.\n> \n> (5,1) is at x=5,y=1, bottom right.\n> \n> (2,6) is x=2,y=6, top left, but y=6 is row 6, and since y=0 is bottom? Usually in grids, y=0 is bottom or top? The problem doesn't specify, but in the positions, snake is at (3,4), (3,5), etc., and direction D is down, so probably y increases up or down?\n> \n> In standard coordinates, often y=0 is top or bottom. But here, walls at y=0 and y=7, and snake at y=4 and 5, with head at (3,4) moving down to... if moving down, and from (3,5) to (3,4), so y=5 to y=4, so if y decreases down, then down is decreasing y.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (3,2), which is below (3,4) if y decreases down.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,1) is lower, (2,6) is higher y.\n> \n> So let's assume y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top, so down decreases y, up increases y.\n> \n> In the movement: U (x,y+1), D (x,y-1), L (x-1,y), R (x+1,y)\n> \n> So U: y+1, up; D: y-1, down; so y increases up, decreases down. So y=0 is bottom, y=7 top.\n> \n> In positions, (3,4) to (3,3) is down, y decreases.\n> \n> Food: (3,2) at y=2, so below (3,4); (5,1) at y=1, bottom; (2,6) at y=6, top.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (3,6), which is near top.\n> \n> Now, back to moves.\n> \n> At turn 11, from (3,4), possible actions: D, L, R. (U not possible due to reverse and collision)\n> \n> D: to (3,3)\n> \n> L: to (2,4)\n> \n> R: to (4,4)\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead, prioritize survival, maximize score.\n> \n> Food: (3,2) is close, at (3,2), life span 4, so it will disappear after turn 14.

Let's sequence.\n> \n> Turn 11: move from (3,4) to (3,3). After move, snake positions: head at (3,3), body at (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), tail at (5,5)? When head moves to (3,3), the segment that was at (3,5) becomes part, but the tail at (5,5) moves? Since no food eaten, tail moves off.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to previous position, tail is removed.\n> \n> So after turn 11 move to (3,3):\n> \n> - Head to (3,3)\n> \n> - The body segment that was at (3,5) moves to where?

No.\n> \n> When head moves, each body segment shifts to the position of the previous segment in front.\n> \n> So: segment 1 (neck) moves to where head was, (3,4)\n> \n> Segment 2 moves to where segment 1 was, (3,5)\n> \n> Segment 3 (tail) moves to where segment 2 was, (4,5)\n> \n> And the old tail position (5,5) is vacated.\n> \n> So new positions: head (3,3), body (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)\n> \n> (4,5) is the new tail.\n> \n> Now, turn 12: from (3,3), head direction is D (since moved down).\n> \n> Possible moves: U (up to (3,4)), D (down to (3,2)), L (left to (2,3)), R (right to (4,3))\n> \n> But (3,4) is occupied by body, so moving U to (3,4) would cause collision.\n> \n> Also, cannot move U because current direction is D, opposite?

It's turn 12, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since the walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. That means the grid goes from (0,0) to (7,7), but since walls occupy those borders, I can't move to cells where x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (3,6).\n> \n> Snake positions: Head is at (3,3), then body segments at (3,4), (3,5), and tail at (4,5). So the snake is moving downward, since head direction is D.\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (3,2) with life span 3 and value +1 (positive food)\n> \n> - (5,1) with life span 5 and value +1\n> \n> - (2,6) with life span 8 and value +1\n> \n> All food is positive, no negative food mentioned. Value is 1 for all, so they all increase length by 1 when eaten.\n> \n> Life span: For (3,2), life span 3, meaning it disappears after 3 turns including the current turn. Since current turn is 12, it will disappear after turn 14? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so:\n> \n> - At turn 12, life span 3: will disappear after turn 14? Let's clarify.\n> \n> The life span decreases every turn, including the current one. So if life span is N at turn t, it will be present for turns t, t+1, ..., t+N-1, and disappear at turn t+N.\n> \n> For food at (3,2) with life span 3 at turn 12:\n> \n> - Turn 12: life span 3\n> \n> - Turn 13: life span 2\n> \n> - Turn 14: life span 1\n> \n> - Turn 15: life span 0, disappears. So it can be eaten up to turn 14.\n> \n> Similarly for others.\n> \n> (5,1): life span 5 at turn 12, so disappears after turn 16.\n> \n> (2,6): life span 8 at turn 12, disappears after turn 19.\n> \n> Now, snake head is at (3,3), direction down. Possible moves: I can move U (up), D (down), L (left), R (right), but need to avoid walls, obstacles, and body collisions. Also, no instant reverse, so since current direction is D, I cannot move U (up) next, because that would be reverse.\n> \n> Current direction is D, so opposite is U. So I cannot move U on this turn. Allowed moves: D, L, R.\n> \n> Now, let's see the grid to visualize.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? Walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so movable cells are x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? Let's confirm.\n> \n> x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x from 1 to 6 inclusive? Similarly for y.\n> \n> For example, (1,1) to (6,6) should be movable, I think. But walls are at the borders, so cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls, so the playable area is x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? Let's see the coordinates.\n> \n> Snake positions: (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5). (3,5) is y=5, which should be within bounds if y from 1 to 6.\n> \n> y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=1 to 6 are free, similarly x=1 to 6.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (3,6). (3,6) – y=6, which is the top row? y=0 bottom, y=7 top? Typically in grids, y=0 might be bottom or top, but in coordinates, it's given as positions.\n> \n> The walls: border cells x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7. So for example, (0,0) to (0,7), (7,0) to (7,7), (0,0) to (7,0), (0,7) to (7,7) are all walls. So the inner grid is x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6.\n> \n> (3,6) is at y=6, which is adjacent to y=7 wall, but it's a cell, and there's an internal obstacle at (3,6), so that cell is blocked.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (3,2), (5,1), (2,6).\n> \n> (2,6) is y=6, x=2.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (3,3). Current direction D, so moving down.\n> \n> Possible moves from (3,3):\n> \n> - U: up to (3,4) – but (3,4) is occupied by the snake's body segment. Is that a collision?\n> \n> Rule: body collision if head touches any body segment. But there's an exception: you can move into the tail cell because the tail moves away.\n> \n> Snake positions: head (3,3), then (3,4), (3,5), tail (4,5).\n> \n> If I move up to (3,4), that is the position of the first body segment. Since the body will move, but when I move, the head moves to a new position, and each segment moves to the next position.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, the tail end moves away or stays if food eaten.\n> \n> But for collision: head cannot move to a cell occupied by any body segment except that it can move to the tail cell if the tail is moving away.\n> \n> Rule says: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> Also, \"the head and newly grown tail will collide\" in the tail reward danger case.\n> \n> So, for a move to (3,4): (3,4) is currently occupied by the first body segment, not the tail. Tail is at (4,5).\n> \n> So moving to (3,4) would cause collision with body, since it's not the tail.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,3) to (3,4) is up, but (3,4) is body, so invalid.\n> \n> Directions: U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1)? Let's see the definition.\n> \n> \"U(x,y+1), D(x,y-1), L(x-1,y), R(x+1,y)\"\n> \n> But which way is y increasing? Typically in such grids, y=0 might be bottom or top. But in positions, snake is at (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), so as y increases, it's going up? (3,3) to (3,4) to (3,5), so y=5 is above y=4, etc.\n> \n> Head direction is D, down, so from (3,5) it was moving to (3,4)? Positions: [(3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)] head first.\n> \n> Head is at (3,3), which is below (3,4) and (3,5), so if head is at (3,3) and direction is D, meaning it just moved down to (3,3) from previous position.\n> \n> Previous head position must have been (3,4), and it moved down to (3,3). But (3,4) is now the first body segment.\n> \n> Let's list positions in order: index 0: head (3,3), index 1: (3,4), index 2: (3,5), index 3: tail (4,5).\n> \n> Since head direction is D, it was moving down, so from (3,4) to (3,3) at last move.\n> \n> Now, from current head (3,3), possible moves:\n> \n> - U: to (3,4) - but (3,4) is occupied by body segment at index 1. This is not the tail, so moving here would cause collision. Invalid.\n> \n> - D: to (3,2) - what is there? (3,2) has food, but let's see if it's free.\n> \n> (3,2) is a cell, and food is present, but the cell might be free or occupied. Food can be on a cell, and the snake can move there to eat it, but if the cell is occupied by body, it might be blocked.\n> \n> The cell (3,2): is it occupied? Snake positions are (3,3),(3,4),(3,5),(4,5), so (3,2) is not occupied by snake. Also, no wall or obstacle mentioned except borders and (3,6). (3,2) is within bounds: x=3, y=2, x from 1-6, y from 1-6, so y=2 is fine.\n> \n> Internal obstacles only (3,6), so (3,2) is free except for food.\n> \n> But food doesn't occupy the cell; it's just an item on the cell. The cell can be moved to.\n> \n> - L: left to (2,3) - x=2,y=3, should be within bounds, no snake or obstacle? Snake at (3,3) etc., not (2,3). Walls: x=0 and x=7 walls, so x=2 is fine. Internal obstacles only (3,6), so (2,3) should be free.\n> \n> - R: right to (4,3) - similarly, (4,3) not occupied, free.\n> \n> Now, also, D to (3,2): (3,2) has food, but it's free to move to.\n> \n> But we have to consider if moving there causes any issue.\n> \n> First, let's list possible moves:\n> \n> - U: to (3,4) - occupied by body, collision, invalid\n> \n> - D: to (3,2) - free, and has food\n> \n> - L: to (2,3) - free\n> \n> - R: to (4,3) - free\n> \n> But current direction is D, so reverse is U, which is invalid anyway. So allowed moves are D, L, R.\n> \n> Now, D to (3,2) is possible and has food.\n> \n> But we need to think multiple turns ahead.\n> \n> Also, there's a rule about tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> Currently, tail is at (4,5), head at (3,3). Are they adjacent? Adjacent means sharing an edge, so (3,3) and (4,5) are not adjacent; they are diagonal, so not adjacent. Distance: |dx| + |dy| = |1| + |2| = 3, so not adjacent. Adjacent would be |dx| + |dy| =1.\n> \n> So no issue with tail reward danger now.\n> \n> Now, food at (3,2) has life span 3, meaning it can be eaten up to turn 14 (since turn 12,13,14 it exists, disappears turn 15).\n> \n> Similarly, (5,1) life span 5, up to turn 16, and (2,6) up to turn 19.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan a sequence of moves for at least 5 turns ahead to maximize score, prioritizing long-term survival.\n> \n> First, immediate choice: I can move D to (3,2) to eat the food there. But is that safe?\n> \n> If I move D to (3,2), I eat the food, so snake grows. After eating, the tail doesn't move, so new positions: head moves to (3,2), then body: the current head (3,3) becomes new segment 1, then (3,4), (3,5), and tail (4,5) stays because we ate food, so length increases by one.\n> \n> Snake grows after eating: when head moves to food cell, it eats, so the tail doesn't move that turn, so new segments added at head, tail stays.\n> \n> Standard: when you eat food, the head moves to the food cell, and a new segment is added at the tail position, but since tail doesn't move, it extends.\n> \n> Positions: after move to food, head is at food cell, and the previous tail remains, so the body has one more segment.\n> \n> For example, current positions: [(3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)] length 4.\n> \n> Move D to (3,2) eat food: new head at (3,2), then the previous positions: (3,3) becomes segment 1, (3,4) segment 2, (3,5) segment 3, and (4,5) segment 4, but since we ate, we add a new segment, so tail stays at (4,5), and a new segment is added? No.\n> \n> When you eat, the head moves to the new position, and the tail does not move, so the snake grows by one cell at the tail end.\n> \n> So positions become: head (3,2), then body: (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), and tail (4,5) — but (4,5) is still there, so the segments are now: [(3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)] length 5.\n> \n> (3,5) and (4,5) are both part of the body.\n> \n> Now, direction: after moving D, head direction becomes D, I think, but we track direction for the next move.\n> \n> After moving, the head is at (3,2), and we just moved D, so for next turn, direction is D.\n> \n> But (3,2) is at the bottom? y=2, and walls at y=0, so moving down further might be dangerous.\n> \n> y=1 is above y=0? Let's clarify y-direction.\n> \n> U: (x,y+1) so y increases up? D: (x,y-1) y decreases down.\n> \n> So y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top.\n> \n> In positions, (3,3) to (3,2) is down, towards lower y.\n> \n> (3,2) is at y=2, which is one above y=1, and y=0 is wall, so (3,2) to (3,1) is possible, but (3,1) to (3,0) is wall, invalid.\n> \n> Similarly, x=0 and x=7 walls.\n> \n> Back to move: if I move D to (3,2), I eat the food, grow to length 5.\n> \n> Then, from (3,2), possible moves: U, D, L, R.\n> \n> But no instant reverse: since I just moved D, I cannot move U (up) next turn.\n> \n> So allowed: D, L, R.\n> \n> D to (3,1): y=1, which is free? No snake or obstacle, but y=1 is within bounds, walls at y=0, so (3,1) is playable.\n> \n> L to (2,2), R to (4,2), both should be free.\n> \n> But if I move D to (3,1), then from there, I might be cornered if I go further down.\n> \n> y=1, then if I move D to (3,0), but y=0 is wall, invalid. So from (3,1), I cannot move D, only U, L, R.\n> \n> But let's not get ahead yet.\n> \n> Another option: move L or R instead of D.\n> \n> For example, move L to (2,3).\n> \n> Then head to (2,3), no food there, so no growth, snake moves: head to (2,3), then body to (3,3), (3,4), tail to (3,5)? Positions: after moving, head to (2,3), segment 1 to previous head (3,3), segment 2 to (3,4), segment 3 to (4,5)? Let's see the order.\n> \n> Current: positions list: head (3,3), seg1 (3,4), seg2 (3,5), tail (4,5)\n> \n> After move L to (2,3): head moves to (2,3), then each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment in front.\n> \n> So seg1 moves to where head was, (3,3), seg2 moves to where seg1 was, (3,4), seg3 (tail) moves to where seg2 was, (3,5). Since no food eaten, tail moves to (3,5), and (4,5) is vacated.\n> \n> New positions: [(2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5)] length 4, tail at (3,5).\n> \n> Similarly, if move R to (4,3): [(4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5)] or [(4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (4,5)]? seg2 was (3,5), which moves to where seg1 was (3,4)? Positions: index: head (3,3), index1 (3,4), index2 (3,5), index3 (4,5)\n> \n> After head to (4,3): new head (4,3), then index1 moves to old head (3,3), index2 moves to old index1 (3,4), index3 moves to old index2 (3,5). So new positions: [(4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5)]\n> \n> Tail at (3,5).\n> \n> Now, from there, I can plan further.\n> \n> But let's think about the food.

It's turn 13. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and an internal obstacle at (3,6). So, the playable area is from x=1 to x=6 and y=1 to y=6, except for (3,6) which is blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (3,2), then body segments at (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), and tail at (4,5). So the snake is 5 segments long. Head direction is down, which is D. That means last move was down, so from (3,2) to (3,3) or something? Positions are given with head first: (3,2) is head, then (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5). Since head direction is D, it must have moved down to (3,2) from above, but let's see the sequence.\n> \n> If head is at (3,2) and direction is D, that means it moved down to get there, so previous position was (3,1) or something? But positions are listed as [(3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)]. (3,2) to (3,3) would be down if y increases up? No, let's clarify coordinates.\n> \n> In the movement, U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), so y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top? But walls are y=0 and y=7, so y=0 is bottom wall, y=7 is top wall. Similarly, x=0 left, x=7 right.\n> \n> In positions, (x,y): (3,2) to (3,3) to (3,4) to (3,5) to (4,5). Since head direction is D, meaning down, decreasing y. But from (3,3) to (3,2) would be down if y decreases down. Let's think.\n> \n> If U is (x,y+1), that means y increases upwards, so U is up, D is down (y decreases). So point (x,y) with y=0 at bottom, y=7 at top.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (3,2), then (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5). (3,3) has higher y than (3,2), so (3,3) is above (3,2). But head is at (3,2), and next segment is (3,3), which is above it, so the snake is going upwards? But head direction is given as D, down. Contradiction?\n> \n> Head direction: \"Snake Head Direction: D\" and positions: head (3,2), then (3,3). Since (3,3) has y=3 > y=2 of head, so (3,3) is above head. But if head moved to (3,2) from previous position, and direction is D (down), that means it came from a higher y. But the body segment is at (3,3), which is above, so when the snake moves down to (3,2), the body was at (3,3) before, but after move, head is at (3,2), and the segment that was head is now at (3,3), I think I'm confusing myself.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when snake moves, head goes to new position, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> So positions at turn t: [head, segment1, segment2, ..., tail]\n> \n> After move in direction, new head is head + direction, then new body is old head, then old segment1, etc., and tail is removed if no food eaten, or kept if food eaten.\n> \n> In this case, positions: [(3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)] with head direction D.\n> \n> Since head direction is D, that means the snake just moved down to (3,2). So before the move, head was at (3,3), and it moved down to (3,2). After move, new positions: head at (3,2), then old head (3,3) becomes segment1, then (3,4) segment2, (3,5) segment3, and (4,5) tail. That makes sense because from (3,3) to (3,2) is down, decreasing y.\n> \n> And (3,3) is now the first body segment.\n> \n> Similarly, before that, it might have been at (3,4) or something.\n> \n> Anyway, for current state, head at (3,2), direction just moved D, so possible moves: since last move was D, I cannot move U (up) immediately, because no instant reverse. So possible actions: D (down), L (left), R (right). Not U.\n> \n> Now food positions:\n> \n> - (5,1) with life span 4, value +1\n> \n> - (2,6) with life span 7, value +1\n> \n> - (4,1) with life span 10, value +1\n> \n> All food is positive, value +1, no negative food mentioned. And life span decreases each turn, including current.\n> \n> Current turn is t1=13, so for food at (5,1): life span 4, so it will disappear after 4 more turns? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn t, if life span is N, it will disappear after N turns, meaning it can be eaten for N more turns including current.\n> \n> The rule: \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So for a food with life span L at turn t, it will be there for turns t, t+1, ..., t+L-1, and disappear at turn t+L.

This ensures we don't miss the expiring food while keeping options open for (2,6) and (4,1) later.\n- Moving D to (4,1) immediately would eat (4,1) but might make it harder to reach (5,1) in time (though it's still possible via R to (5,1) on turn 15).\n- Moving U to (4,3) delays eating any food and risks missing (5,1).\n\n### Decision:\nMove **R to (5,2)** to set up eating (5,1) next turn while keeping the path flexible for future moves.\n\n\\boxed{R}",

The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and an internal obstacle at (3,6). So, the playable area is from x=1 to x=6 and y=1 to y=6, except where blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (4,2), then body segments at (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), and tail at (3,5). The head is moving right (R), so from (4,2), moving right would go to (5,2).\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (5,1) with life span 3 and value +1 (positive food)\n> \n> - (2,6) with life span 6 and value +1 (positive food)\n> \n> - (4,1) with life span 9 and value +1 (positive food)\n> \n> All food is positive; no negative food here.\n> \n> Current turn is t=14. I need to think at least 5 turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n> \n> First, let's map out the grid for clarity. Grid size: x from 0 to 7, but walls at x=0,x=7,y=0,y=7, so valid cells are (1,1) to (6,6), except (3,6) is an obstacle.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (3,6), so (3,6) is blocked.\n> \n> Snake: head (4,2), body (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5). So the snake is mostly vertical from (3,2) to (3,5), with head at (4,2). Since head is at (4,2) and direction is R, it just moved from (3,2) to (4,2), I assume.\n> \n> Snake positions are given in order: index 0 is head, then body. So positions: [(4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5)]. So the head is at (4,2), and it's moving right. The previous position was (3,2), so it came from left to (4,2).\n> \n> Now, possible moves from current position (4,2) with direction R.\n> \n> Since direction is R, I can move U, D, R, but not L because L would be opposite to R, and no instant reverse is allowed. So cannot move left immediately.\n> \n> Available moves: U (up, to (4,3)? Let's see coordinates.\n> \n> Assuming y increases upwards? Typically in grids, y=0 is bottom, but here it says U (x,y+1), D (x,y-1), so y increases as we go up? Let's confirm.\n> \n> From the movement: U (x,y+1), D (x,y-1), L (x-1,y), R (x+1,y). So for a point (x,y), U increases y by 1, so y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top? But walls are at y=0 and y=7, so y=0 is bottom wall, y=7 is top wall. Similarly, x=0 left, x=7 right.\n> \n> So for head at (4,2):\n> \n> - U: (4, 2+1) = (4,3)\n> \n> - D: (4, 2-1) = (4,1)\n> \n> - R: (4+1,2) = (5,2)\n> \n> - L: (4-1,2) = (3,2) but (3,2) is occupied by the body, and since it's the second segment, but we need to check if it's safe.\n> \n> Also, cannot move L because it's opposite to current direction R? No instant reverse rule: cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\n> \n> Current direction is R, so moving left would be opposite, so not allowed. So L is invalid.\n> \n> Therefore, from (4,2), possible moves: U to (4,3), D to (4,1), R to (5,2).\n> \n> Now, check for collisions:\n> \n> - (4,3): is this a wall? Walls: x=0,x=7,y=0,y=7, and internal (3,6). (4,3) is within 1-6 for both x and y, not (3,6), so not wall. Is it occupied by snake? Snake positions: (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5). (4,3) is not in this list, so free. So U to (4,3) is safe.\n> \n> - (4,1): similarly, x=4,y=1, not wall, not snake position? (4,1) is not listed, so free. But there is food at (4,1)? Food: (5,1), (2,6), (4,1). Yes, (4,1) has food with life span 9. But we're just moving, not necessarily eating yet.\n> \n> Moving to (4,1) would eat the food if head moves there, but let's think step by step.\n> \n> - (5,2): x=5,y=2, not wall, not snake? Snake has (4,2), (3,2), etc., no (5,2), so free. Also, food at (5,1) nearby.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead. So plan a sequence of moves for the next few turns.\n> \n> First, let's list all food:\n> \n> - Food at (5,1): life span 3, so disappears after 3 turns, including current turn? Life span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn t=14, life span 3, so it will disappear after turn 16? Let's see.\n> \n> Life span: decreases every turn, including the current turn. So if life span is N at turn t, it disappears at the end of turn t + N - 1? Standard way: if life span is L at turn t, it decreases by 1 each turn, so it exists for L turns, disappearing after turn t + L - 1.\n> \n> For example, at turn t, life span L, then at turn t+1, life span L-1, ..., at turn t + L - 1, life span 1, then after that turn, it disappears. So it can be eaten from turn t to turn t + L - 1.\n> \n> Here, at turn 14:\n> \n> - Food (5,1): life span 3, so can be eaten on turn 14,15,16. Disappears after turn 16.\n> \n> - Food (2,6): life span 6, so can be eaten on turn 14 to 19.\n> \n> - Food (4,1): life span 9, so can be eaten on turn 14 to 22.\n> \n> All have value +1.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (4,2), direction R.\n> \n> I need to maximize score, but prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> First, let's consider immediate moves.\n> \n> If I move D to (4,1), I eat the food at (4,1). Since it's positive food, I gain +1 score, and snake length increases by 1. So after eating, the snake will have a new segment added, so positions will be: head at (4,1), then the old head (4,2) becomes body, and so on, tail at (3,5). So new length 6.\n> \n> But I need to think about future moves.\n> \n> Moving to (4,1) might be risky if I get trapped or something.\n> \n> Similarly, moving U to (4,3) or R to (5,2).\n> \n> Now, let's think about the food at (5,1) with short life span. It disappears soon, so I might want to eat it before it's gone.\n> \n> (5,1) life span 3, so I have until turn 16 to eat it.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,6) has longer life, and (4,1) has very long life.\n> \n> But (4,1) is directly below me at (4,2), so moving D eats it immediately.\n> \n> But let's see the risks.\n> \n> After moving to (4,1), head at (4,1).

So we added a new segment at the end.\n> \n> Yes, so the tail position remains, and it's part of the body.\n> \n> In this case, from [ (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4) ]\n> \n> If move down to (5,1) and eat food: new head at (5,1), then previous head (5,2) is first body, then (4,2), then (3,2), then (3,3), then (3,4) tail, and since food eaten, we add a new segment at (3,4), so tail is now at (3,4) with two segments? No.\n> \n> The new segment is added at the current tail position before move.\n> \n> Before move, tail is at (3,4).\n> \n> After head moves to (5,1), the segments: head (5,1), then (5,2) (was head), then (4,2) (was first body), then (3,2) (was second body), then (3,3) (was third body), then (3,4) (was tail, now second last), and since food eaten, a new segment is added at (3,4), so positions become: [(5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)] with (3,4) as tail? But (3,4) is listed twice?

Seg2 was at (3,2), so moving to seg2's position would be (3,2), but that's the same? No.\n> \n> The segments are moved in order.\n> \n> Typically, the body segments follow the head.

Currently, (4,2) is occupied by body, so I can't eat it directly. As per rules, food can be under body, but can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves onto it later.\n> \n> So (4,1) has food, but it's under the snake body? Snake positions: (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), etc. (4,2) is a body segment, and food is at (4,1), which is different cell, so not under the body. \"under the snake's body\" means same cell, I think.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: the body moves away, and the head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> So for (4,1), it is not under the body; it's a free cell with food.

This decision aligns with the strategy of securing immediate rewards while maintaining a safe path for future moves. \n\nHere’s the reasoning distilled:\n1. **Immediate Reward**: Moving left to (4,1) allows the snake to eat positive food (+1 score, +1 length) without collision risks.\n2. **Forced Continuation**: After eating (4,1), the only safe move is left again to (3,1) (another positive food), further increasing score and length.\n3. **Long-Term Safety**: Subsequent moves (left to (2,1), then upward) guide the snake toward open space, avoiding collisions and expired food.\n4. **Constraints**: The snake cannot reverse (no \"U\" from current direction \"D\") or move into walls/body segments.

It's turn 16, and I'm the AI controlling the snake. The grid has walls: border cells at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and one internal obstacle at (3,6). So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), with walls on the borders and an obstacle at (3,6).\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (5,1), then body segments at (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4).

Since positions are given with head first, and it moved to (5,1), and head direction is D, that means it came from above, so previous head was at (5,0) or something, but (5,2) is the first body segment, so the snake was moving down to (5,1) from (5,0), but (5,0) is y=0, which is a wall, so that might be a problem? Let's see the positions: [(5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)]. Head at (5,1), then (5,2) is directly above it? y=2 is above y=1 if y increases upwards? No, typically in grids, y=0 is bottom or top? I need to clarify the coordinate system.\n> \n> The movement: U is (x,y+1), so y+1 is up, meaning y increases as we go up. So (0,0) is bottom-left? But walls are given: border cells x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7. So y=0 is bottom, y=7 top, x=0 left, x=7 right.\n> \n> So head at (5,1): x=5, y=1. Head direction D, which is down, so to (x,y-1), so it was moving to lower y. Previous position must have been (5,2) or something? Snake positions: head (5,1), then next is (5,2). (5,2) has higher y, so it's above (5,1). So the snake was moving down from (5,2) to (5,1), so head direction D makes sense.\n> \n> Now, food positions:\n> \n> - (2,6) with life span 4, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (4,1) with life span 7, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (3,1) with life span 10, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> All food is positive, no negative food mentioned. Value 1 for all, so all give +1 score and increase length when eaten.\n> \n> Life span: for (2,6), life span 4, meaning it disappears after 4 turns, including current turn? \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so on turn 16, life span is 4, so it will disappear after turn 19? Let's see: life span N, disappears after N turns. Countdown decreases every turn including current.\n> \n> So for food at (2,6), life span 4 on turn 16. After turn 16, life span becomes 3, then turn 17: 2, turn 18: 1, turn 19: 0, so it disappears before turn 20? Or after the turn when countdown reaches 0?\n> \n> \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> I think it's better to think: on turn t, if life span is L, then after L more turns it disappears. So after turn t + L - 1? Let's clarify.\n> \n> Suppose on turn t, life span is L. After turn t, countdown becomes L-1. After turn t+1, L-2, ..., after turn t + L - 1, countdown becomes 0, so it disappears before turn t + L? Or at the start of turn t + L?\n> \n> The rule says: \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> I think \"after N turns\" means after N full turns have passed. So if on turn t, life span is N, then after turn t, it decreases to N-1, and so on, until after turn t + N - 1, it decreases to 0, and disappears before turn t + N? To be precise, let's assume that at the beginning of turn t, the life span is checked, and if it's 0, it disappears. But the countdown decreases at the end of the turn or during the turn?\n> \n> The rule: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> I think it's safer to assume that at the start of each turn, before the snake moves, the life span is updated? Or after the move?\n> \n> The state is given at the start of turn t1, so for food, it has life span L at turn t1. After the snake moves on turn t1, the life span decreases by 1 for all food, and if any reaches 0, it disappears before the next turn.\n> \n> Similarly for subsequent turns.\n> \n> But for planning, I need to know when food will disappear.\n> \n> For (2,6): life span 4 on turn 16. After turn 16, it becomes 3; after turn 17, 2; after turn 18, 1; after turn 19, 0, so it disappears before turn 20. So it can be eaten on turns 16,17,18,19.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,1) life span 7: can be eaten from turn 16 to 22.\n> \n> (3,1) life span 10: turns 16 to 25.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan my moves for at least 5 turns ahead, prioritizing long-term survival over immediate rewards.\n> \n> Current snake head position: (5,1)\n> \n> Head direction: D (down)\n> \n> From (5,1), possible moves: U, D, L, R, but with constraints.\n> \n> Since head direction is D, I cannot do instant reverse, so I cannot move U (up) on the next turn because U is opposite to D.\n> \n> D is down, so opposite is U. So I cannot move U on turn 16.\n> \n> Possible actions: D (down), L (left), R (right)\n> \n> Now, let's see the grid.\n> \n> Walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Also internal obstacle at (3,6).\n> \n> Snake body: positions: (5,1) head, (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)\n> \n> So body segments at (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)\n> \n> Now, food at (4,1), (3,1), (2,6)\n> \n> (4,1) is at x=4,y=1, which is left of head? Head at (5,1), so (4,1) is adjacent left.\n> \n> (3,1) is at x=3,y=1, which is two left of head, but not adjacent; adjacent cells are one step.\n> \n> (2,6) is at x=2,y=6, which is far.\n> \n> First, let's see what moves are possible from (5,1) on turn 16.\n> \n> Possible moves:\n> \n> - D: down to (5,0). But y=0 is a wall, so collision, death. Not possible.\n> \n> - L: left to (4,1). (4,1) is a food position. Also, is it occupied? Snake body: (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4). (4,1) is not in the body, and it's not a wall except borders, but (4,1) is x=4,y=1, y=1>0, not wall. Walls are y=0, so (4,0) would be wall, but (4,1) is fine. Also, internal obstacle at (3,6), not here. So (4,1) is free and has food.\n> \n> - R: right to (6,1). (6,1): x=6<7, y=1>0, not wall, and not in snake body, so free.\n> \n> - U: up to (5,2). But (5,2) is the first body segment. Now, can I move there?\n> \n> Rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> (5,2) is not the tail; tail is at (3,4).

The head direction is left, which means it was moving left last turn.\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - One at (2,6) with value 1 and life span 3. Since life span decreases every turn, including current, that means on turn 17, life span is 3, so it will disappear after turn 19 (since it decreases each turn: turn 17: life=3, turn 18: life=2, turn 19: life=1, turn 20: gone? Wait, let's clarify life span.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".

So it will last until turn 25 or so, but since we're on turn 17, life=9, it decreases each turn, so it disappears after turn 25 (17 + 9 - 1 = 25? Let's see: turn 17:9, 18:8, ..., 25:1, 26:0 gone. So can be eaten from turn 17 to 25.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead. So I should plan for turns 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, etc.\n> \n> First, let's map out the grid. It's an 8x8 grid? x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7, so 8x8 cells, but borders are walls, so playable area is x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? No, borders are x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7, so cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls.

Positions are given as list, so index 0 is head, index 1 to 6 are body, with index 6 being the tail.\n> \n> Snake has 7 segments: positions from (4,1) to (3,4).\n> \n> Now, head direction is L, so last move was left to (4,1).\n> \n> I need to choose an action for turn 17: U, D, L, or R. But no instant reverse, so since head direction is L, I cannot move right (opposite) on this turn. So possible moves: U, D, or L? Direction is the current head direction, meaning the direction it was moving when it arrived at the head position.\n> \n> Rule: \"Snake Head Direction: L\" and \"Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\"\n> \n> So current direction is L, so for turn 17, I cannot move R (right), because that would be opposite.

Snake positions: (4,2) is the third segment? Positions: [(4,1), (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), ...] so (4,2) is the fourth position, which is a body segment.\n> \n> In terms of movement: when the snake moves, the head moves to a new cell, and the tail moves forward, so the cell that was tail is vacated, but other body cells remain occupied.\n> \n> For collision: head cannot move to a cell occupied by any body segment except the tail, because when head moves, tail also moves, so if head moves to the current tail position, it's ok, but after move, the tail is gone, so no collision.\n> \n> Rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment).

What index? Positions: index 0: (4,1), index 1: (5,1), index 2: (5,2), index 3: (4,2), so (4,2) is the body segment at index 3, which is not the tail. Tail is (3,4). So (4,2) is a middle body segment, so moving to (4,2) would cause collision with body, invalid.\n> \n> - Down to (4,0): y=0, wall, invalid.\n> \n> - Left to (3,1): is (3,1) occupied? Snake positions: (3,2), (3,3), (3,4) are body, but (3,1) is not listed. Let's list all occupied cells: from snake: (4,1), (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4). So (3,1) is not occupied. Also, not a wall. Walls are borders and (3,6). (3,1) is within bounds: x=3, y=1, min x=1? x from 1 to 6? x=0 and x=7 walls, so x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6 are playable, except internal obstacles.\n> \n> Internal obstacle: (3,6), so (3,1) is clear.\n> \n> - Right: (5,1), but (5,1) is the first body segment, index 1, not tail.

Tail is still (3,4), but since I ate food, the tail doesn't move, so the new tail is (3,4)? When you eat food, the tail stays, so length increases.\n> \n> After eating, the snake: head moves to (3,1), and a new segment is added where the head was, so positions: new head (3,1), then previous head (4,1) becomes body, then (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4). So now 8 segments: (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4).

Also, moving right would be opposite to current direction? Current head direction is now L, after moving left.

Since no food, tail moves, so new head (2,1), body: (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3). Tail was (3,4), but since tail moves, it is removed, so (3,3) is now tail?

Let me confirm the coordinates.\n> \n> The grid goes from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7, but since these are walls, the actual cells we can move to are from (1,1) to (6,6). For example, x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x from 1 to 6; similarly y from 1 to 6. So it's a 6x6 grid? No: x from 0 to 7 inclusive is 8 cells, but x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x=1 to x=6 are playable, similarly y=1 to y=6. So yes, 6x6 grid.\n> \n> But let's list the snake positions: [(3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)]. So head is at (3,1), and it's moving left, since head direction is L.\n> \n> Current turn is t=18.\n> \n> Food: only one food given: (2,6) with value 1 and life span 2. Life span 2 means it disappears after 2 turns, including current turn? Life span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 18, life span is 2, so it will disappear after turn 19? Let's see: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So at turn t, if life span is N, it decreases to N-1 at turn t+1, and disappears when countdown reaches 0.\n> \n> For food at (2,6): position (2,6), value 1, life span 2 at turn 18.\n> \n> At turn 18, life span=2, so:\n> \n> - After turn 18, life span becomes 1?

Let me read carefully.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> I think it means that when the food is spawned, it has a life span N. At each turn, including the turn it is spawned, the countdown decreases by one. So if it appears at turn t with life span N, at the start of turn t, life span is N. After the turn, it decreases to N-1, and so on, until it reaches 0, and it disappears after that turn.\n> \n> But in the input, it's given at turn 18 with life span 2.

Distance: x from 3 to 2 is 1 left, y from 1 to 6 is 5 up, so not close.\n> \n> Now, snake positions: let's list them in order:\n> \n> Head: (3,1) - index 0\n> \n> Then (4,1) - index 1\n> \n> (5,1) - index 2\n> \n> (5,2) - index 3\n> \n> (4,2) - index 4\n> \n> (3,2) - index 5\n> \n> (3,3) - index 6\n> \n> (3,4) - index 7\n> \n> So tail is (3,4).\n> \n> The snake is moving left, head at (3,1), direction L, so next move could be L, U, or D, but not R because that would be reverse, which is not allowed.

Positions: (3,2) is index 5, which is a body segment.

But when we move, if we go to (3,2), and since the tail is at (3,4), and we're not eating food, the snake moves: head to (3,2), then the body segments shift, so the segment that was at (3,2) moves to where?

It's turn 19, and the grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So coordinates from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are the borders, so playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6) I think? No, walls occupy x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the grid is 8x8, but the snake can only be on cells where x from 1 to 6 and y from 1 to 6? Let me confirm.\n> \n> The walls are border cells: x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7. So any cell with x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7 is a wall and cannot be moved to. Internal obstacles are given as (3,6). So cells (3,6) is also a wall.\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (2,1), then (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3). So the snake has 8 segments. Head direction is L, which is left, so currently moving left.\n> \n> Food: two pieces.\n> \n> - (2,6) with value 1 and life span 1. Life span 1 means it disappears after this turn? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 19, life span 1, it will disappear after this turn, meaning if not eaten on turn 19, it's gone.\n> \n> Life span: disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current. So for food at (2,6), life span 1 at turn 19. That means it will disappear after turn 19, so it must be eaten on turn 19 to be consumed. If not eaten now, it vanishes.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (6,1) with value 1 and life span 10, so it has 10 turns left including this one.\n> \n> Both foods have value +1, so positive food.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan an action sequence for at least 5 turns ahead, prioritizing long-term survival over immediate rewards.\n> \n> Current head position: (2,1), direction L (left). So from (2,1), moving left would go to (1,1), but let's see what's around.\n> \n> Possible moves: U (up), D (down), L (left), R (right). But current direction is L, so I cannot instantly reverse to R on the next turn. Reverse of L is R, so I cannot move right immediately. So possible moves from current position (2,1) with head dir L: U, D, L. R is not allowed because it's instant reverse.\n> \n> No instant reverse: cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn. So from L, opposite is R, so cannot move R. So options: U, D, L.\n> \n> Now, let's list the snake positions to understand the body.\n> \n> Snake: [(2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3)]\n> \n> Head at (2,1), then body: (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), tail at (3,3).\n> \n> I should sketch this grid mentally.\n> \n> Grid: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls: all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 cells are walls. Also internal obstacle at (3,6).\n> \n> Playable area: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, except where snake or obstacles.\n> \n> Obstacles: (3,6) is wall, so cannot go there.\n> \n> Food at (2,6) and (6,1).\n> \n> (2,6): x=2,y=6. Is this within playable? y=6 is not wall, walls are y=0 and y=7, so y=6 is playable. Similarly, (6,1) x=6,y=1, playable.\n> \n> Now, (2,6) has life span 1, so only available this turn.\n> \n> Current head at (2,1). Can I reach (2,6) this turn? From (2,1) to (2,6) is not adjacent; it's 5 cells away vertically, so impossible to reach in one move. So (2,6) cannot be eaten this turn because head is not adjacent to it.\n> \n> To eat food, head must move onto the food cell when it's present.\n> \n> (2,6) is at distance, so I can't eat it on turn 19. Since life span 1, it disappears after this turn, so it's gone forever. I can ignore this food; it's not reachable in time.\n> \n> Confirming: turn 19, food at (2,6) with life span 1. Countdown decreases every turn including current, so after turn 19, it disappears. To eat it, head must be on (2,6) during turn 19. But head is at (2,1), which is not (2,6), and moving, say, up to (2,2) doesn't help; it's still far. So yes, impossible to eat (2,6) on turn 19, so it vanishes. Only food left is (6,1) with life span 10.\n> \n> Now, (6,1) has value +1, life span 10, so plenty of time.\n> \n> But I need to think about survival and long-term.\n> \n> First, let's see the current possible moves from (2,1) with dir L: U, D, L.\n> \n> - U: up to (2,2)\n> \n> - D: down to (2,0), but y=0 is wall, so (2,0) is wall, cannot move there. Walls are y=0, so (x,0) for any x is wall. So D to (2,0) is invalid, collision with wall.\n> \n> - L: left to (1,1)\n> \n> - R: right to (3,1), but (3,1) is occupied by the snake body. Snake positions: (2,1) head, then (3,1) is the first body segment. So moving right to (3,1) would cause collision with body, since (3,1) is part of the snake and not the tail in a way that allows moving there? Let's see collision rules.\n> \n> Deadly collisions: body collision (head touches any body segment). But note: you can move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will move forward.\n> \n> In this case, moving to (3,1): is (3,1) the tail? No, tail is at (3,3). Snake segments: index 0: (2,1) head, index 1: (3,1), index 2: (4,1), etc., up to index 7: (3,3) tail.\n> \n> So (3,1) is a body segment, not tail. If head moves to (3,1), it would collide with the body segment there, since it's not the tail, and tail is elsewhere.\n> \n> The rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, only if moving to the current tail position, it might be safe if the tail moves away.\n> \n> Here, (3,1) is not the tail; it's the second segment. Tail is at (3,3). So moving to (3,1) would be collision with body.\n> \n> Similarly, moving to any cell occupied by body except the tail is collision.\n> \n> Also, walls: (2,0) is wall.\n> \n> So from (2,1), possible moves:\n> \n> - U: to (2,2). Is (2,2) occupied? Snake positions: let's list all: (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3). So (2,2) is not in the list, so empty? x=2,y=2, not in positions, so should be free.\n> \n> - D: to (2,0), but y=0 wall, invalid.\n> \n> - L: to (1,1). x=1,y=1. Walls: x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x=1 is not wall, y=1 not wall. Is (1,1) occupied? Not in snake positions, so free.\n> \n> - R: to (3,1). But (3,1) is occupied by snake body, and it's not the tail, so collision, invalid.\n> \n> So only valid moves: U or L.\n> \n> U to (2,2) or L to (1,1).\n> \n> Now, current direction is L, so after moving, the head direction will change.\n> \n> I need to plan multiple turns.\n> \n> Also, food at (6,1) which is available.\n> \n> But (6,1) is at (6,1), which is on the bottom row, y=1.\n> \n> Head is at (2,1), so same y=1 row.\n> \n> Now, let's think about the snake body. The snake is coiled; from (2,1) to (3,1) to (4,1) to (5,1) to (5,2) to (4,2) to (3,2) to (3,3).

However, moving into the tail is safe because the tail will move away when the snake advances.\n\n**Cannot move Down (D)**: This would be the opposite of the current direction U, which is not allowed.\n\n### Evaluating the Options\n\n**Option 1: Move Up (U) to (2,3)**\n- **Pros**:\n  - Moves the snake into open space, potentially allowing more room to maneuver.\n  - Avoids immediate proximity to the body segments.\n- **Cons**:\n  - Moves away from the food at (6,1), potentially making it harder to reach within the food's lifespan.\n  \n**Option 2: Move Left (L) to (1,2)**\n- **Pros**:\n  - Also moves into open space.\n- **Cons**:\n  - Moves away from the food, increasing the distance to reach it.\n  - The path to the food from (1,2) would be longer and more convoluted.\n\n**Option 3: Move Right (R) to (3,2)**\n- **Pros**:\n  - Moves towards the food at (6,1).\n  - (3,2) is the tail, so moving here is safe as the tail will move away.\n  - Initiates a path that can efficiently reach the food within a few moves.\n- **Cons**:\n  - Moves closer to the body segments, but careful planning can avoid collisions.\n\n### Planning the Path to the Food\n\nIf we choose to move right (R) to (3,2), here's how the subsequent moves can lead us to the food:\n\n1. **Turn 20 (Current)**: R to (3,2)\n   - New head: (3,2)\n   - Body segments shift: tail moves from (3,2) to (4,2)\n   - Direction after move: R\n\n2. **Turn 21**: R to (4,2)\n   - (4,2) is the new tail position, so safe to move here.\n   - New head: (4,2)\n   - Tail moves to (5,2)\n   - Direction: R\n\n3. **Turn 22**: R to (5,2)\n   - (5,2) is the tail, safe to move here.\n   - New head: (5,2)\n   - Tail moves to (5,1)\n   - Direction: R\n\n4. **Turn 23**: D to (5,1)\n   - (5,1) is the tail, safe to move here.\n   - New head: (5,1)\n   - Tail moves to (5,2)\n   - Direction: D\n\n5. **Turn 24**: R to (6,1)\n   - (6,1) is the food location, and it's unoccupied.\n   - Eating the food increases the snake's length by 1.\n   - New head: (6,1)\n   - Tail does not move (since the snake grows), so the new segment is added where the tail was (5,2).\n   - Direction: R\n\nThis sequence allows the snake to reach and eat the food by turn 24, well within the food's lifespan (which lasts until turn 29).\n\n### Post-Eating Movement\n\nAfter eating at (6,1), the snake's head is at (6,1), and its direction is R (from the last move). Possible moves from here:\n\n- **U to (6,2)**: Free space.\n- **D to (6,0)**: Wall (y=0), not allowed.\n- **L to (5,1)**: Occupied by the body segment (previous head position).\n- **R to (7,1)**: Wall (x=7), not allowed.\n\nThus, the only possible move is U to (6,2), which is safe and moves the snake into open space.\n\n### Verifying Safety\n\nThroughout the sequence:\n\n- Moving into the tail is safe because the tail moves away when the snake advances.\n- No moves result in the head colliding with any body segment except the tail, which is permissible.\n- All moves are within the grid boundaries and avoid walls.\n\n### Alternative Paths\n\nAlternative paths, such as moving up initially, would take longer to reach the food and might not guarantee reaching it within the lifespan. For example:\n\n1. **Turn 20**: U to (2,3)\n2. **Turn 21**: R to (3,3)\n3. **Turn 22**: R to (4,3)\n4. **Turn 23**: R to (5,3)\n5. **Turn 24**: D to (5,2)\n   - (5,2) might be occupied by the body by this time, depending on how the snake's body shifts.\n6. Further moves would be needed to reach (6,1), increasing the risk of not reaching the food in time.\n\nThis path is less efficient and more risky compared to the direct path via moving right initially.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe most efficient and safe sequence to eat the food at (6,1) within its lifespan is to move right initially, followed by a series of right and down moves to reach the food by turn 24, then move up to open space afterward.\n\n### Final Action Sequence\n\n\\boxed{R} (for the immediate turn 20)\n\n*Subsequent moves (for completeness, though the question asks for immediate action at t0=20):*\n- Turn 21: R\n- Turn 22: R\n- Turn 23: D\n- Turn 24: R (eat food)\n- Turn 25: U",

It's turn 20, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since the walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid goes from (0,0) to (7,7), with walls on the borders. There's also an internal obstacle at (3,6).\n> \n> The snake's positions are: head at (2,2), then body segments at (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2). So let's list them in order:\n> \n> - Head: (2,2)\n> \n> - Segment 1: (2,1)\n> \n> - Segment 2: (3,1)\n> \n> - Segment 3: (4,1)\n> \n> - Segment 4: (5,1)\n> \n> - Segment 5: (5,2)\n> \n> - Segment 6: (4,2)\n> \n> - Segment 7: (3,2)  // this should be the tail, I think.\n> \n> Positions: [(2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2)]\n> \n> So from head to tail: (2,2) -> (2,1) -> (3,1) -> (4,1) -> (5,1) -> (5,2) -> (4,2) -> (3,2)\n> \n> The head direction is U, which is up. So currently moving upwards.\n> \n> Food: only one piece given: at (6,1) with value 1 and life span 10. Value 1 means it's positive food, since penalty would be -1. Life span 10, and it decreases every turn, including this one. So after turn 20, it will have 9 turns left, and so on.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks. Prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> First, let's visualize the grid. I'll sketch a mental grid.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n> \n> Walls: borders and internal obstacle at (3,6).\n> \n> Snake positions:\n> \n> - (2,2): head\n> \n> - (2,1)\n> \n> - (3,1)\n> \n> - (4,1)\n> \n> - (5,1)\n> \n> - (5,2)\n> \n> - (4,2)\n> \n> - (3,2): tail\n> \n> So the snake is kind of looped around. Let's plot this.\n> \n> For y=2: cells (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2) are occupied, but (2,2) is head, (3,2) is tail, (4,2) and (5,2) are body.\n> \n> Actually, positions: (2,2) head, (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2) tail.\n> \n> So at y=1: (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1) — that's a row from x=2 to x=5 at y=1.\n> \n> Then at y=2: (2,2) head, (5,2), (4,2), (3,2) tail. (3,2) is tail, but it's at the same y as head? Head is at (2,2), tail at (3,2).\n> \n> Also, (5,2) is between (5,1) and (4,2) or something. Let's list coordinates:\n> \n> - Head: (2,2)\n> \n> - Next: (2,1)  // down from head? Head at (2,2), then (2,1) is directly below, since y decreases down? In grid coordinates, usually y=0 is bottom or top? The problem says U is (x,y+1), so y increases up, I assume. Standard: U (up) increases y, D (down) decreases y.\n> \n> Head direction is U, so moving up to (2,2) from previous? Current head at (2,2), direction U, meaning it just moved up to (2,2) or is about to move? The state is at turn 20, before the move, I think. I need to clarify when actions are taken.\n> \n> The action sequence is for turns starting from t1=20. So at turn 20, I choose an action to move from current position.\n> \n> Current head position: (2,2), direction U, meaning that on the previous turn, it moved up to (2,2), so from (2,1) to (2,2)? Positions: head at (2,2), then (2,1) is the first body segment. So yes, it moved from (2,1) to (2,2) on turn 19 or something, but we don't have history, just current positions and direction.\n> \n> Direction U means the head is facing up, so it can move U, L, R, but not D instantly, since no reverse.\n> \n> Movement constraints: cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn. Current direction is U, so cannot move D on turn 20.\n> \n> Possible moves from (2,2): U, L, R.\n> \n> - U: (2,3)\n> \n> - D: not allowed, opposite to U\n> \n> - L: (1,2)\n> \n> - R: (3,2)\n> \n> But (3,2) is occupied by the tail? Tail is at (3,2), but since the tail will move when the snake moves, it might be ok to move into the tail's current position, as long as it's not a body segment that doesn't move.\n> \n> Collision rules: head touches any body segment except that it can move to the tail's cell because the tail moves away.\n> \n> \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, moving to (3,2) should be safe because (3,2) is the tail, and when the snake moves, the tail will move to the previous position of the second-last segment, which is (4,2) or something.\n> \n> Let's see the snake positions: indices: let's say segment 0: head (2,2), segment 1: (2,1), segment 2: (3,1), segment 3: (4,1), segment 4: (5,1), segment 5: (5,2), segment 6: (4,2), segment 7: tail (3,2)\n> \n> When the snake moves, if head moves to a new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment before it. So tail segment 7 (current (3,2)) will move to where segment 6 was, which is (4,2), but segment 6 will move to segment 5, and so on.\n> \n> Specifically, after a move, the new positions: head goes to new position, segment 1 goes to old head position, segment 2 to old segment 1 position, ..., segment 7 to old segment 6 position.\n> \n> So if head moves to (x,y), then new positions: head at (x,y), segment 1 at old head (2,2), segment 2 at old seg1 (2,1), segment 3 at old seg2 (3,1), segment 4 at old seg3 (4,1), segment 5 at old seg4 (5,1), segment 6 at old seg5 (5,2), segment 7 at old seg6 (4,2). Old segment 6 is (4,2), so tail moves to (4,2).\n> \n> Therefore, the cell (3,2) will be vacated when the snake moves, so moving head to (3,2) should be safe, as it becomes the new position, and tail moves away.\n> \n> Similarly, if head moves to (3,2), which is current tail, after move, head is at (3,2), body: segment 1 at (2,2), segment 2 at (2,1), segment 3 at (3,1), segment 4 at (4,1), segment 5 at (5,1), segment 6 at (5,2), segment 7 at (4,2). So no collision.\n> \n> Now, back to possible moves from (2,2):\n> \n> - U: to (2,3)\n> \n> - L: to (1,2)\n> \n> - R: to (3,2)  // which is safe as above\n> \n> Now, what about walls? Walls at borders, so x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. (1,2) is within bounds, x=1>0, x=1<7, y=2>0, y=2<7, so no wall. Similarly (2,3) and (3,2) are within bounds.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (3,6), which is not relevant for immediate moves since we're at y=2.\n> \n> Food at (6,1) with value 1, life span 10.\n> \n> Life span 10 at turn 20, so it will disappear after 10 turns, meaning it will be there until turn 30? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 20, life span 10, after turn 20, it becomes 9, and so on, until life span 0, then disappears. So it can be eaten from turn 20 to turn 29, I think? Turn 20: life span 10, after turn 20 action, if not eaten, life span decreases to 9 for turn 21, and so on, down to 0 on turn 30, meaning it disappears before turn 30 or after? Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> \"Disappears after N turns\" might be ambiguous. Countdown decreases every turn, including current.\n> \n> So at turn t, food has life span L, it can be eaten on turn t, then on turn t+1, if not eaten, life span becomes L-1, and so on, until life span 0, it disappears and cannot be eaten.\n> \n> For this food, at turn 20, life span 10, so it can be eaten on turns 20 to 29? When life span decreases to 0, it disappears.\n> \n> After turn t, if not eaten, life span decreases by 1 at the end of turn or beginning?\n> \n> The problem says: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> And \"disappears after N turns\" – I think it means that after being on the grid for N turns, it disappears.\n> \n> But countdown decreases every turn including current, so at turn t when it spawns, life span N, after turn t, it has N-1 left, etc.\n> \n> For this food, at turn 20, life span 10, meaning it has 10 turns left including turn 20. So it will be present for 10 turns, from turn 20 to turn 29, and after turn 29, it disappears, so on turn 30 it's gone.\n> \n> It can be eaten on any turn from 20 to 29.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan actions for at least 5 turns ahead, but since food life span is long, I can take time to get it.\n> \n> First, let's find a path to the food at (6,1).\n> \n> Current head at (2,2), food at (6,1).\n> \n> So need to move right and down, but carefully.\n> \n> Also, the snake body is around, so I need to avoid colliding with body or walls.\n> \n> Current possible moves:\n> \n> - U to (2,3): what is there? Currently, from positions, (2,3) is not occupied, and not wall, so free.\n> \n> - L to (1,2): free, not occupied.\n> \n> - R to (3,2): currently occupied by tail, but as we said, it will move, so safe to move there.\n> \n> If I move R to (3,2), as above, new head at (3,2), tail at (4,2), etc.\n> \n> But (3,2) was tail, now head moves there, so it's fine.\n> \n> Now, I need to think about the food at (6,1).

Tail is now at (4,2).\n> \n> From (3,2), I can then move to eat the food.\n> \n> Food at (6,1), so from (3,2), I can move D to (3,1), but (3,1) is currently occupied by segment 3, but after the move, when I move to (3,1), let's see.\n> \n> At turn 20, after moving to (3,2), positions as above.\n> \n> Then at turn 21, head at (3,2), I can move D to (3,1).\n> \n> But (3,1) is currently occupied by segment 3, which is at (3,1) in the new positions?

This approach ensures the food is secured by turn 24 (well within its 10-turn lifespan) while maintaining maneuverability in the less congested upper-right area.\n",

It's turn 21, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid (since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so grid from (0,0) to (7,7)).\n> \n> Walls: Border cells are all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, meaning I can't move outside this grid. There's also an internal obstacle at (3,6).\n> \n> Snake positions: Head is at (3,2), then body segments at (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (5,2), (4,2). So the snake is 8 segments long. Head direction is R (right), so it's moving to the right.\n> \n> Food: There's one food at (6,1) with value 1 and life span 9. Since it's value 1, it's positive food. Life span 9 means it will disappear after 9 turns, including the current turn, so it has 8 more turns left after this one? Let me confirm: life span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 21, life span is 9, meaning it will disappear after turn 29 (21 + 8 = 29? Turn 21: life span 9, after turn 21 it becomes 8, so it disappears when life span reaches 0, which would be after 9 turns from now. Turn 21: life span 9, turn 22: life span 8, ..., turn 29: life span 0, so it disappears at the start of turn 30 or something? But the rule says \"disappears after N turns\", and countdown decreases every turn including current. So for food at turn t with life span N, it will be there for N more turns, including turn t. So at turn t, life span N, it will be present until turn t + N - 1, and disappear at turn t + N. Let's see: at turn t, life span N, after turn t, life span becomes N-1, and so on, until life span 1 at turn t + N - 1, then after that turn, it disappears, so not present at turn t + N. So for turn 21, life span 9, food is present from turn 21 to turn 29, and disappears at turn 30.\n> \n> But for now, I need to plan my moves.\n> \n> The food is at (6,1).

After eating, moving left on turn 25 avoids body collision and opens space for future movement, balancing immediate reward with long-term survival by starting to navigate away from the corner.\n",

It's turn 23. The grid has walls: border cells where x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7, and there's an internal obstacle at (3,6). So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls block those cells.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (4,3), then body segments: (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1). So the snake is 8 segments long. Head direction is Up, meaning it was moving upwards to reach (4,3).\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (6,1) with life span 7 and value 1 (positive food)\n> \n> - (5,4) with life span 9 and value 1 (positive food)\n> \n> Both foods are positive, no negative food mentioned.\n> \n> I need to plan an action sequence for the next few turns, thinking at least 5 turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n> \n> Key constraints:\n> \n> - Can't move opposite to current direction instantly. Since head direction is U (up), I can't move D (down) on the next turn. Possible moves: U, L, R. D is not allowed because it's opposite.\n> \n> - Collisions: walls or body segments. But moving into tail is okay if tail moves away, except for the tail reward danger case.\n> \n> - Tail Reward Danger: If head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide. In this case, the tail is at (5,1), and food is at (6,1) and (5,4), neither is on the tail currently. Tail is (5,1), food at (6,1) is adjacent, but not on tail. (5,4) is elsewhere.\n> \n> Food at (6,1) is at x=6,y=1, tail is at (5,1), so adjacent horizontally. But the food is on a cell, not on the tail. The tail reward danger only applies if the food is on the tail cell and head is adjacent to it, then eating it causes collision.\n> \n> From the rules: \"Tail Reward Danger: If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake...\"\n> \n> So, for this to happen, two conditions:\n> \n> 1. Head is adjacent to the tail segment.\n> \n> 2. The tail cell has positive food on it.\n> \n> Currently, tail is at (5,1). Is there food on (5,1)? Food positions are (6,1) and (5,4), so no food on (5,1). So no immediate danger.\n> \n> Now, I need to consider the food life spans. Food at (6,1) has life span 7, meaning it disappears after 7 turns, including current turn. So at turn 23, life span 7, it will disappear after turn 29 (since countdown decreases every turn, including current).\n> \n> Life span N: disappears after N turns, so if life span is L at turn t, it will be gone at turn t + L.\n> \n> At turn 23, food at (6,1) has life span 7, so it disappears after turn 23 + 7 = 30? Let's see: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so at turn 23, life span is 7, meaning after this turn, it will be 6, then 5, etc., down to 0 when it disappears.\n> \n> So, if life span is S at turn t, it will disappear at the start of turn t + S? Or end of turn?\n> \n> Typically, it decreases each turn, so after S turns, it reaches 0 and disappears. So for food at (6,1), life span 7 at turn 23, it will disappear after 7 turns, so at the start of turn 30, or end of turn 29? I need to be precise.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So at turn t, with life span N, after this turn, countdown is N-1, and so on, until countdown 0, it disappears.\n> \n> So, after turn t + N - 1, it disappears? Let's think.\n> \n> At turn t, countdown starts at N. After turn t, countdown becomes N-1. After turn t+1, countdown N-2, ..., after turn t + (N-1), countdown becomes 0, and it disappears at that point? Or after the turn when countdown reaches 0, it is removed.\n> \n> I think it's common to have the food disappear when countdown reaches 0, which would be after N turns from now.\n> \n> For example, at turn 23, life span 7. After turn 23, countdown 6. After turn 24, countdown 5. ... After turn 29, countdown 0, so it disappears at the end of turn 29 or start of turn 30? But the rule says \"disappears after N turns\", so likely at turn t + N, it is gone.\n> \n> Similarly for the other food.\n> \n> To simplify, for planning, I can think that food at (6,1) must be eaten by turn 29, and food at (5,4) by turn 31, since life span 9 at turn 23, disappears after 9 turns, so by turn 32? Turn 23 + 9 = 32, but let's calculate.\n> \n> At turn 23, life span 7 for (6,1): after 7 decreases, it will be gone after turn 23 + 6? No.\n> \n> Start: turn 23, life span 7.\n> \n> After turn 23 (i.e., after processing turn 23), life span decreases to 6.\n> \n> After turn 24, decreases to 5.\n> \n> ...\n> \n> After turn 29, decreases to 0, and then it disappears. So it is present during turns 23 to 29, and gone at turn 30.\n> \n> Similarly, for (5,4), life span 9 at turn 23: present during turns 23 to 31, gone at turn 32.\n> \n> Turn 23: life span 9\n> \n> After turn 23: 8\n> \n> After turn 24: 7\n> \n> ...\n> \n> After turn 31: 0, gone at turn 32.\n> \n> So (6,1) must be eaten by turn 29, (5,4) by turn 31.\n> \n> Now, current snake head at (4,3), direction U.\n> \n> Possible moves: since direction U, cannot move D.

Current positions: (4,4) is head, (4,3) is neck, etc. (4,5) is not in the list, so it should be empty.\n> \n> Similarly, L to (3,4): not in positions, so empty.\n> \n> R to (5,4): not in positions, empty.\n> \n> Also, since the tail might move, but when I move, the head goes to a new position, and the tail end is removed, so unless I eat food, length stays the same.\n> \n> Food: (6,1) and (5,4). (5,4) is directly to the right of head at (4,4), so if I move R to (5,4), I can eat the food there, since it's positive, value=1, and life_span=8.\n> \n> (6,1) is farther away.\n> \n> But I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n> \n> Also, life_span: for (6,1), life_span=6, which means it will disappear after 6 turns, including current turn. So at turn 24, life_span=6, so it will disappear after turn 29? Let's see: life_span decreases every turn, including current.\n> \n> At turn t, food has life_span L, it will disappear after L turns, meaning it's gone at turn t + L.\n> \n> For (6,1): life_span=6 at turn 24, so it will be there until turn 24 + 6 - 1? Or turn 24 + 6?\n> \n> The rule says: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So, at turn t, with life_span N, it decreases to N-1 at turn t+1, and so on, until N=0, then it disappears.\n> \n> Typically, if life_span is N at turn t, it will be present for N more turns, including turn t. So it disappears at the start of turn t + N, or something. I need to clarify.\n> \n> Let's assume that at the beginning of turn t, food is present with life_span L. After the turn, life_span decreases by 1. When life_span reaches 0, it disappears before the next turn.\n> \n> The rule: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> It might be ambiguous. I think it's better to think that during turn t, the food is present with current life_span, and after the turn, life_span decreases.\n> \n> But for planning, since we act on turn t, the food is there if life_span > 0 at the start of turn.\n> \n> Similarly, when we move, we eat if head moves to food cell.\n> \n> For (6,1) at turn 24, life_span=6, so it will last until turn 29? Let's calculate:\n> \n> - Turn 24: life_span=6\n> \n> - After turn 24, life_span decreases to 5\n> \n> - Turn 25: life_span=5\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - Turn 29: life_span=1\n> \n> - After turn 29, life_span decreases to 0, so it disappears before turn 30.\n> \n> So food is available from turn 24 to turn 29 inclusive. 6 turns: 24,25,26,27,28,29.\n> \n> Similarly for (5,4): life_span=8 at turn 24, so available until turn 31 (turns 24 to 31 inclusive, 8 turns).\n> \n> Now, back to moves.\n> \n> If I move R to (5,4), I eat the food immediately. Since it's positive, snake length increases by 1, so after eating, the tail doesn't move, so new positions: head at (5,4), then previous head (4,4) becomes body, and so on, tail stays at (4,1)? Let's see.\n> \n> Current snake: positions list is head to tail: [(4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1)]\n> \n> If I move R to (5,4) and eat food, then new head is (5,4), and the body segments: previous head (4,4) is now first body, then (4,3), (4,2), etc., and since I eat, I add a new segment, so tail becomes (4,1) still, but the new tail is added, so length increases.\n> \n> Standard Snake: when you eat, head moves to food, new head is food cell, previous head becomes neck, and tail doesn't move, so the snake grows by one cell.\n> \n> So after moving R and eating: new positions: head (5,4), then (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1) — and since I ate, I add a new segment at the end, but where? When you eat, the tail doesn't advance, so the last segment stays, and a new segment is added in the direction, but actually, in terms of positions, the tail position remains for this turn, and next turn when I move, the tail might stay or move depending.\n> \n> I need to clarify the movement.\n> \n> When the snake moves:\n> \n> - Head moves to new cell.\n> \n> - If new cell has food, eat it: snake grows, so the tail does not move; the new head position is added, and tail stays, so length increases by one.\n> \n> - If no food, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, and the tail segment is removed, so length same.\n> \n> In terms of positions list:\n> \n> - After move without eating: new head at new position, body segments shift: the old head becomes first body, and so on, last body segment is removed.\n> \n> - After move with eating: new head at new position, body segments: old head to second last remain, and the tail segment stays, so new positions include all old positions plus new head, minus nothing, so length +1.\n> \n> For example, current positions: [H, B1, B2, ..., T] with length L.\n> \n> Move to new cell:\n> \n> - If no food: new positions = [new_head, H, B1, B2, ..., up to second last], so tail T is removed.\n> \n> - If food: new positions = [new_head, H, B1, B2, ..., T], so all segments kept, and new head added, so length L+1.\n> \n> In the list, indices: head is index 0, tail is index L-1.\n> \n> After move to new_cell:\n> \n> - If not eat: new positions = [new_cell] + positions[:-1]  # head and all but last body\n> \n> - If eat: new positions = [new_cell] + positions  # head and all previous segments\n> \n> Yes.\n> \n> In this case, if I move R to (5,4) and eat the food, new positions: [ (5,4) ] + [ (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1) ] so head (5,4), then (4,4), (4,3), ..., down to (4,1), and since I ate, the tail (4,1) is still there, and length is 9 now.\n> \n> Now, what about the food at (5,4)?

Internal obstacle at (3,6), not here. So (6,4) should be free.\n> \n> - L: (4,4) but (4,4) is the first body segment, so if I move L to (4,4), that would be collision with body, since (4,4) is occupied by the neck.\n> \n> So from (5,4), moving L to (4,4) is invalid, collision.\n> \n> But I cannot move L anyway because it would be reverse if direction is R, but direction is R, so L is reverse, not allowed.

Let's list the positions in order:\n> \n> - (5,4) head\n> \n> - (4,4)\n> \n> - (4,3)\n> \n> - (4,2)\n> \n> - (3,2)\n> \n> - (2,2)\n> \n> - (2,1)\n> \n> - (3,1)\n> \n> - (4,1) tail\n> \n> Now, head direction is right, so it came from left, since previous position was (4,4), and moved right to (5,4).\n> \n> Possible moves from head (5,4):\n> \n> - Up: (5,5)\n> \n> - Down: (5,3)\n> \n> - Left: (4,4) but (4,4) is the second segment, which is the neck. Since head direction is right, moving left would be opposite direction, but I need to check the no instant reverse rule.\n> \n> No instant reverse: cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn. Current direction is right, so I cannot move left immediately. So left is invalid.\n> \n> Valid moves: U, D, R? Right to (6,4)? Let's see.\n> \n> From (5,4):\n> \n> - U: (5,5)\n> \n> - D: (5,3)\n> \n> - L: (4,4) but (4,4) is occupied by body? No, (4,4) is the first body segment, but when we move, the snake moves, so the head moves to a new cell, and the tail moves forward, so we can move to cells that are not occupied by body except possibly the tail.\n> \n> Collision rules: body collision if head touches any body segment except the tail, because the tail will move away. So we can move into the tail cell since the tail will leave that cell.\n> \n> In this case, from (5,4), possible moves:\n> \n> - Up: (5,5) - is this free? Let's check if it's occupied or wall.\n> \n> First, walls: borders, so x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. (5,5): x=5, y=5, not border, not (3,6), so should be free? But is it occupied by snake?\n> \n> Snake positions: (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1). So (5,5) is not in this list, so it's empty.\n> \n> Similarly, down to (5,3): not in snake positions, not wall.\n> \n> Right to (6,4): x=6, y=4, not border (since x=7 is border, x=6 is ok), not obstacle, not in snake positions? Snake has (5,4), (4,4), etc., but (6,4) is not listed, so should be free.\n> \n> Left to (4,4): but (4,4) is occupied by the first body segment. Since it's not the tail, moving there would cause collision because the body segment doesn't move immediately? No.\n> \n> When the head moves to a cell, if that cell is occupied by a body segment other than the tail, it's a collision. But if it's the tail, it's ok because the tail moves.\n> \n> Here, (4,4) is the second segment, not the tail. The tail is (4,1). So (4,4) is a body segment that will still be there after the move, so moving left to (4,4) would cause head to collide with body.\n> \n> Moreover, moving left is opposite to current direction right, so it's invalid due to no instant reverse.\n> \n> So valid moves from (5,4) are:\n> \n> - U: (5,5)\n> \n> - D: (5,3)\n> \n> - R: (6,4)\n> \n> Now, I need to think about the food. Food at (6,1) and (1,3).\n> \n> (6,1) is at x=6,y=1. Currently, the snake has segments around there? (2,1), (3,1), (4,1) are at y=1, but x=2,3,4. (6,1) is further right.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,3) is at x=1,y=3.\n> \n> Life span: (6,1) can be eaten until turn 29, disappears turn 30. Current turn 25, so we have 5 turns to eat it.\n> \n> (1,3) has life span 10, so until turn 34, plenty of time.\n> \n> But we need to maximize score, so eating food is good, but avoid risks.\n> \n> Also, there's a special case: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it can be dangerous if it causes collision.\n> \n> First, let's see where the tail is. Tail is at (4,1), and there's no food on it currently? Food is at (6,1) and (1,3), not on (4,1), so no issue now.\n> \n> But (6,1) has food, and tail is at (4,1), which is two cells left, but not adjacent directly? Adjacent means sharing a side, so (4,1) and (6,1) are not adjacent; they are separated by (5,1), which is empty I think.\n> \n> Grid: at y=1, x from 0 to 7. Walls at x=0 and x=7. Snake has (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), so (1,1), (5,1), (6,1) might be empty.\n> \n> (6,1) has food, so it's occupied by food, not snake.\n> \n> Now, to eat (6,1), we need to get the head there when it's free.\n> \n> Similarly for (1,3).\n> \n> But (1,3) is on the left, far from current position.\n> \n> Current head at (5,4), food at (6,1) and (1,3).\n> \n> (6,1) is closer, only 3 steps away if we go directly: from (5,4) to (5,3) to (5,2) to (5,1), then right to (6,1)? But (5,1) might be occupied or not.\n> \n> Let's find a path.\n> \n> First, I need to think about the snake's body and possible traps.\n> \n> The snake body: from head (5,4), then down to (4,4), which is left, then down to (4,3), then down to (4,2), then left to (3,2), then left to (2,2), then down to (2,1), then right to (3,1), then right to (4,1) tail.\n> \n> So it's like a path: from (5,4) to (4,4) to (4,3) to (4,2) to (3,2) to (2,2) to (2,1) to (3,1) to (4,1).\n> \n> The area around (4,1) to (2,1) and (2,2) to (3,2) is occupied.\n> \n> Now, empty cells: for example, (5,5), (5,3), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (5,2), (4,5), (3,5), etc., but some might be walls or obstacles.\n> \n> Walls: borders, so y=0 and y=7 are walls. x=0 and x=7.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (3,6), which is x=3,y=6.\n> \n> So (3,6) is blocked.\n> \n> Now, food at (6,1): we need to go there before turn 30.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,3) later.\n> \n> But (1,3) is at (1,3), which is near (2,2) and (2,1), but (2,2) is body, (2,1) is body, so (1,3) might be accessible from above or left, but left is wall.\n> \n> x=0 is wall, so (1,3) is at the left border.\n> \n> To eat (1,3), we need to approach from right, down, or up, but not left since wall.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,1) at right, x=6, y=1, not border yet.\n> \n> Since (6,1) has short life span, only 5 turns, we should prioritize eating it if possible.\n> \n> But we need to see if we can get there safely.\n> \n> First, from current position (5,4), possible moves: U to (5,5), D to (5,3), R to (6,4).\n> \n> If we go R to (6,4), that gets us closer to (6,1), but (6,1) is down and left from there.\n> \n> (6,4) to (6,3) to (6,2) to (6,1) is a direct path down.\n> \n> But we need to check if those cells are free.\n> \n> Currently: (6,4) is free? Snake positions: no, so yes.\n> \n> (6,3): not in snake, should be free.\n> \n> (6,2): free.\n> \n> (6,1): has food, so occupied by food, but when we move there, we can eat it.\n> \n> But are there any body segments there? No.\n> \n> However, when we move to (6,1), we need to consider if the tail is adjacent or something for the tail reward danger.\n> \n> Tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because after eating, the tail grows and occupies the previous tail position, so if head was adjacent, it might collide.\n> \n> But in this case, tail is at (4,1), which is not adjacent to (6,1). (4,1) and (6,1) are separated by (5,1), so distance is 2, not adjacent.\n> \n> Adjacent would be like (4,1) and (5,1) or (4,1) and (4,2), etc.\n> \n> So (6,1) is not adjacent to tail, so no danger.\n> \n> Similarly, if we go down to (5,3), we can go to (5,2), (5,1), then to (6,1).\n> \n> (5,1) is currently empty? Let's see: at y=1, x=5: not in snake positions, snake has (2,1),(3,1),(4,1), so (5,1) is free.\n> \n> (5,2) should be free, (5,3) free.\n> \n> But going to (5,3) first might not be as direct.\n> \n> From (5,4), R to (6,4) seems good to start towards (6,1).\n> \n> But we have to think multiple turns ahead.\n> \n> Also, after eating, the snake grows, so we need space to move.\n> \n> Let's simulate the path to (6,1).\n> \n> Suppose we go R to (6,4) on turn 25.\n> \n> Then head at (6,4), direction right? After moving, the head direction changes to the move direction.\n> \n> When we move, the head direction becomes the new direction.\n> \n> So if we move R to (6,4), head direction becomes R.\n> \n> Then from (6,4), we can go U, D, L, or R?

After moving to (6,4), the snake positions: head (6,4), then (5,4) which was head, now body, then (4,4), (4,3), etc., and tail (4,1) moves? When head moves, the tail moves forward only if no food eaten; if food eaten, tail stays, so length increases.\n> \n> But we haven't eaten food yet.\n> \n> So on turn 25, if we move R to (6,4), no food there, so snake moves: head to (6,4), body: (5,4) becomes second segment, then (4,4) third, and so on, down to (3,1) becomes the new tail, since tail was (4,1), and it moves to where? The tail moves to the next position in the direction of movement, but since the snake moves, each segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so the last segment (tail) is removed.\n> \n> So after moving to (6,4) without eating, new positions: head (6,4), then (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1) — and (4,1) is gone, so tail is (3,1).\n> \n> Original: positions: [ (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1) ]\n> \n> After move R to (6,4): head to (6,4), then the body segments: the first body segment moves to where head was (5,4), second to where first was (4,4), and so on, down to the eighth segment moves to where the seventh was, which is (3,1), and the tail (ninth segment) is removed.\n> \n> List indices: head index 0, body 1 to 8.\n> \n> After move, new head at (6,4), new body[1] at old head (5,4), new body[2] at old body[1] (4,4), new body[3] at old body[2] (4,3), ..., new body[8] at old body[7] (3,1), and old body[8] (4,1) is removed.\n> \n> So new positions: [ (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1) ] and tail is (3,1).\n> \n> (3,1) is tail.\n> \n> Now, from (6,4), we want to go to (6,1) to eat the food.\n> \n> So we can go down: D to (6,3).\n> \n> Then from (6,3), D to (6,2).\n> \n> Then from (6,2), D to (6,1), which has food, so we eat it on turn, say, if we start at turn 25 move to (6,4), turn 26 to (6,3), turn 27 to (6,2), turn 28 to (6,1) and eat.\n> \n> Turn 25: move to (6,4), no eat.\n> \n> Turn 26: from (6,4) to (6,3), no eat yet.\n> \n> Turn 27: from (6,3) to (6,2), no eat.\n> \n> Turn 28: from (6,2) to (6,1), now at (6,1), which has food, so eat it, snake grows, so tail doesn't move, length increases by one.\n> \n> When we eat, the head moves to the food cell, and we add a new segment, so the tail stays where it is.\n> \n> In this case, on turn 28, move to (6,1), eat food, so new head position (6,1), and the body: the previous segments, but since we eat, we add a segment, so the positions: head at (6,1), then the previous head position becomes the new body segment.\n> \n> Before move on turn 28, head is at (6,2), positions: let's track.\n> \n> After turn 25: positions [ (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1) ]\n> \n> After turn 26: move D to (6,3), no eat, so head to (6,3), body[1] to (6,4), body[2] to (5,4), ..., body[8] to (2,1), and (3,1) removed.

It's turn 27. The grid has walls at the borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are at the edges, meaning we can't go to x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (3,6).\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (6,3), then body segments: (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,1). So the snake has 9 segments. Head direction is down, which is D, meaning moving towards decreasing y, so from (6,3) to (6,4) would be up? Let's clarify coordinates.\n> \n> Typically in grids, (0,0) is bottom-left or top-left? The head direction is given as D, and positions are listed head first. Snake positions: [(6,3), (6,4), ...]. From (6,3) to (6,4), if y increases upwards, then moving from (6,3) to (6,4) is up, but head direction is D? That might be inconsistent.\n> \n> Head direction: \"Snake Head Direction: D\" and D is defined as (x,y-1), so decreasing y. But in the positions, head is at (6,3), and next is (6,4). If y=4 is higher than y=3, then moving to (6,4) is increasing y, which would be up, but direction is given as D? That can't be right.\n> \n> Perhaps the coordinates have y=0 at the top? Let me check the movement definitions.\n> \n> Movement: U (x,y+1), D (x,y-1), L (x-1,y), R (x+1,y). So if U is y+1, that might mean y increases downward, or upward? Convention varies, but often in such games, y=0 is top, so U (y+1) would be down? That might be confusing.\n> \n> To avoid confusion, let's look at the positions. Snake positions: head (6,3), then (6,4), (5,4), etc. Since head direction is D, and D is (x,y-1), meaning if the head moves down, it should go to a lower y. But from (6,3), if it moves down to (6,2), but in the list, the next segment is (6,4), which has higher y, so if y increases downward, then (6,4) is below (6,3), so moving to (6,4) is down? I think that's the case.\n> \n> Assume that y increases as we go down, like in a matrix where row 0 is top, row 7 is bottom. So U (y+1) would be down?

But in positions, from head (6,3) to next (6,4), so if y=4 > y=3, and y increases downward, then (6,4) is below (6,3), so moving from (6,3) to (6,4) is down, so direction should be D.\n> \n> But movement definition: D is (x,y-1), which would decrease y, meaning up? Conflict.\n> \n> I think there might be a mistake in the movement definition or my understanding.\n> \n> Look back: \"U`(x,y+1)`, D`(x,y-1)`, L`(x-1,y)`, R`(x+1,y)`\"\n> \n> But in standard, U is usually up, which is decreasing y if y=0 top.\n> \n> But here, U is defined as (x,y+1), which if y=0 top, y+1 is down, so U would be down?

Head direction is the direction the head is currently facing, which is the direction it moved to get to current position.\n> \n> The state says: \"Snake Positions\": [(6,3), (6,4), (5,4), ...] so head is at (6,3), and the second position is (6,4), meaning the head was at (6,4) previous turn and moved to (6,3)? No.\n> \n> Snake positions are given in order: head first, then body. So at current turn, head is at (6,3), and the segment behind it is at (6,4), which means the snake was previously at (6,4) and moved down to (6,3), so direction is down, which is D.\n> \n> But if it moved from (6,4) to (6,3), that means y decreased, so D is (x,y-1), which matches decreasing y.\n> \n> So in this coordinate system, y decreases as we go down? That's unusual.\n> \n> Perhaps y=0 is bottom, so (6,4) is above (6,3) if y increases upward.\n> \n> Let's assume that y=0 is the bottom row, so y increases upward.

If y=4 is higher than y=3, so (6,4) is above (6,3), so the head moved down from (6,4) to (6,3), so direction is down, D, which is consistent with D being (x,y-1), decreasing y.\n> \n> Yes, that makes sense. So coordinate system: (x,y) with y=0 bottom, y=7 top? But walls at y=0 and y=7, so y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top, so as y increases, we go up.\n> \n> So:\n> \n> - U: (x,y+1) - up, to higher y\n> \n> - D: (x,y-1) - down, to lower y\n> \n> - L: (x-1,y) - left\n> \n> - R: (x+1,y) - right\n> \n> For example, from (6,4) to (6,3) is down, y decreased from 4 to 3.\n> \n> Head direction is D, down.\n> \n> Now, food: two items:\n> \n> - (6,1,3,1) - this means (x,y, life_span, value) so position (6,1), life span 3, value 1 (positive food)\n> \n> - (1,3,8,1) - position (1,3), life span 8, value 1 (positive food)\n> \n> Both are positive food, value +1.\n> \n> Life span: for (6,1) it's 3, meaning it disappears after 3 turns, including current turn? \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so at turn 27, life span 3, so it will disappear after turn 29 (since turns 27,28,29, gone at turn 30).\n> \n> Similarly, (1,3) life span 8, so disappears after turn 34.\n> \n> Now, snake body: let's list all positions to understand the shape.\n> \n> Snake positions: [(6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,1)]\n> \n> So plotting this:\n> \n> - Head: (6,3)\n> \n> - Then: (6,4) - above head, since y=4 > y=3, so north\n> \n> - Then (5,4) - west of (6,4)\n> \n> - Then (4,4) - west of (5,4)\n> \n> - Then (4,3) - south of (4,4), y=3 < y=4\n> \n> - Then (4,2) - south of (4,3)\n> \n> - Then (3,2) - west of (4,2)\n> \n> - Then (2,2) - west of (3,2)\n> \n> - Tail: (2,1) - south of (2,2)\n> \n> So the snake is like: head at (6,3), body going north to (6,4), then west to (5,4), (4,4), then south to (4,3), (4,2), then west to (3,2), (2,2), then south to tail at (2,1).\n> \n> Current head direction is down (D), so last move was down to (6,3).\n> \n> Available moves: from head at (6,3), possible moves:\n> \n> - U: (x,y+1) = (6,4) - but (6,4) is occupied by the body, so collision if move there.\n> \n> - D: (x,y-1) = (6,2) - is this valid? y=2, which is within bounds, but need to check if wall or body.\n> \n> Walls: borders x=0,7 y=0,7, so (6,2) is not wall.\n> \n> Body positions: (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,1).

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State\n\nFirst, let's summarize the current state of the game at Turn \\( t_0 = 28 \\):\n\n- **Grid Dimensions**: The playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6). Walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and there's an internal obstacle at (3,6).\n  \n- **Snake**:\n  - Positions: [(5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2)] (head first)\n  - Head Direction: Left (L)\n\n- **Food**:\n  - (6,1): value = +1, life_span = 2 (disappears after Turn 29)\n  - (1,3): value = +1, life_span = 7 (disappears after Turn 34)\n  - (4,6): value = +1, life_span = 10 (disappears after Turn 37)\n\n### Possible Moves from Current Position (5,3) with Direction L\n\nFrom the head at (5,3) moving left (L), the possible immediate moves are:\n\n1. **Left (L)**: (4,3)\n   - Check: (4,3) is part of the snake's body (segment 5). Moving here would cause a collision. **Invalid**.\n   \n2. **Up (U)**: (5,4)\n   - Check: (5,4) is part of the snake's body (segment 3). Collision. **Invalid**.\n   \n3. **Down (D)**: (5,2)\n   - Check: \n     - Not a wall: x=5 (1-6), y=2 (1-6), not (3,6).\n     - Not occupied by snake: (5,2) is not in the snake's current positions.\n   - **Valid**.\n   \n4. **Right (R)**: (6,3)\n   - Check: \n     - Opposite of current direction (L). Instant reverse is not allowed. **Invalid**.\n\n**Conclusion**: The only valid immediate move is **Down (D)** to (5,2).\n\n### Verifying the Down Move\n\nAfter moving Down to (5,2):\n\n- **New Snake Positions**:\n  - Head moves to (5,2).\n  - Body segments shift: (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2).\n  - Tail (2,2) is removed (length remains the same since no food is eaten).\n\n- **New Head Direction**: Down (D) since we moved Down.\n\n### Checking Food Accessibility After Moving Down\n\n1. **Food at (6,1)**:\n   - Life_span = 2 at Turn 28 → Available at Turns 28, 29; disappears at Turn 30.\n   - To eat at Turn 29, must be at (6,1) at Turn 29.\n   - From (5,2) at Turn 29, adjacent cells: (5,1), (5,3) [occupied], (4,2) [occupied], (6,2).\n     - (6,1) is not adjacent to (5,2); cannot reach it in one move.\n   - **Cannot eat (6,1)** before it disappears.\n\n2. **Food at (1,3)**:\n   - Life_span = 7 at Turn 28 → Available until Turn 34.\n   - Distance from (5,2) to (1,3): |5-1| + |2-3| = 5.\n   - Due to body blocks, requires at least 6 moves (e.g., (5,2)→(5,1)→(4,1)→(3,1)→(2,1)→(1,1)→(1,2)→(1,3)).\n   - Earliest arrival at (1,3) is Turn 35, but food disappears after Turn 34.\n   - **Cannot eat (1,3)** before it disappears.\n\n3. **Food at (4,6)**:\n   - Life_span = 10 at Turn 28 → Available until Turn 37.\n   - Plenty of time to reach it, but current path is moving away from it.\n   - Need to plan a path to (4,6) after initial moves.\n\n### Planning Future Moves After Moving Down\n\nFrom (5,2) at Turn 29, possible moves:\n\n- **Down (D)**: (5,1)\n  - Valid: Not a wall, not occupied.\n  \n- **Right (R)**: (6,2)\n  - Valid: Not a wall, not occupied.\n  \n- **Up (U)**: (5,3) [occupied], **Invalid**.\n- **Left (L)**: (4,2) [occupied], **Invalid**.\n\n**Options**: Down to (5,1) or Right to (6,2).\n\n#### Option 1: Down to (5,1)\n\n- **Turn 29**: (5,2) → (5,1)\n- Then, from (5,1), can move Left to (4,1) or Right to (6,1) [no food], or Up to (5,2) [occupied].\n- This path leads away from (4,6).\n\n#### Option 2: Right to (6,2)\n\n- **Turn 29**: (5,2) → (6,2)\n- Then, from (6,2), only Down to (6,1) is valid (others are walls or occupied).\n- This also leads away from (4,6).\n\nGiven that both immediate paths after moving Down don't lead to food quickly, and the other foods are unreachable before they disappear, the primary goal is to **avoid collisions and stay alive**.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAt Turn 28, the only safe move is **Down (D)** to (5,2). This avoids immediate collision and keeps the snake alive, even though it doesn't lead to eating food immediately. \n\n\\boxed{D}",

Let's see the snake positions: [(5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2)]. All these coordinates are between 1 and 6, except... (5,3) to (2,2) all x and y from 2 to 6, so grid is 1 to 6 in both x and y? But walls are at x=0,7 and y=0,7, so cells (0,0) to (7,7) exist, but (0,y) and (7,y) for all y, and (x,0), (x,7) for all x are walls. Also, internal obstacle at (3,6).\n> \n> So playable cells are where both x and y are between 1 and 6 inclusive, except the obstacle at (3,6).\n> \n> Now, snake positions: head at (5,3), direction is L, which is left.

So if at turn t, life span is L, then it disappears at turn t + L - 1? No.\n> \n> The description: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\", and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So for food at (6,1) with life span 2 at turn 28:\n> \n> - Turn 28: life span 2, can be eaten\n> \n> - Turn 29: if not eaten, life span decreases to 1\n> \n> - Turn 30: if not eaten, life span decreases to 0 and disappears?

So last available turn is t + N - 1.\n> \n> Turn t: available, life span N\n> \n> Turn t+1: available, life span N-1\n> \n> ...\n> \n> Turn t + N - 1: available, life span 1\n> \n> After that, gone.\n> \n> So for (1,3): life span 7 at turn 28, so available until turn 28 + 7 - 1 = 34.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,6): life span 10, available until turn 28 + 10 - 1 = 37.\n> \n> All food have value 1, so all positive food? The value is given as 1 for all, and it says \"value\" and \"life span\", so for (6,1) it's (x,y, life_span, value), but value is 1 for all, so all are positive food. No negative food in this state.\n> \n> Food positions: (6,1,2,1) so (x,y, life_span, value), and value=1 for all, so all positive food.\n> \n> Now, snake: head at (5,3), direction L, so moving left. Positions: [(5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2)]\n> \n> So let's list the body segments:\n> \n> - Head: (5,3)\n> \n> - Segment 1: (6,3) — this is the neck? Since head is moving left from (5,3), but previous position.\n> \n> Snake positions are head first: so head is (5,3), then the next segment is where the head was before, and so on.\n> \n> Current direction is L, so head was at (6,3) before moving to (5,3)? Positions: index 0: head (5,3), index 1: (6,3), which is to the right, so yes, head moved from (6,3) to (5,3) by going left.\n> \n> Then (6,4) is the next segment? Let's plot the positions:\n> \n> - (5,3) head\n> \n> - (6,3) — directly right\n> \n> - (6,4) — above (6,3)\n> \n> - (5,4) — left of (6,4)\n> \n> - (4,4) — left of (5,4)\n> \n> - (4,3) — below (4,4)\n> \n> - (4,2) — below (4,3)\n> \n> - (3,2) — left of (4,2)\n> \n> - (2,2) — left of (3,2)\n> \n> So the snake body: from head to tail: (5,3) -> (6,3) -> (6,4) -> (5,4) -> (4,4) -> (4,3) -> (4,2) -> (3,2) -> (2,2)\n> \n> Tail is at (2,2).\n> \n> Now, the head is at (5,3) and moving left, so possible moves: since direction is L, I can move L (left), U (up), D (down), but not R (right) because no instant reverse. Current direction is L, so I cannot move R on the next turn.\n> \n> Possible actions from (5,3): adjacent cells are:\n> \n> - Left: (4,3) — but (4,3) is occupied by the body? Positions: (4,3) is the 6th segment? Let's list indices:\n> \n> 0: (5,3) head\n> \n> 1: (6,3)\n> \n> 2: (6,4)\n> \n> 3: (5,4)\n> \n> 4: (4,4)\n> \n> 5: (4,3)\n> \n> 6: (4,2)\n> \n> 7: (3,2)\n> \n> 8: (2,2) tail\n> \n> So (4,3) is position 5, which is a body segment, not the tail.\n> \n> If I move left to (4,3), it's occupied by body segment, so collision, death.\n> \n> Similarly, up: (5,4) — but (5,4) is position 3, body segment.\n> \n> Down: (5,2) — is this free? Let's see what cells are occupied.\n> \n> Occupied cells: all snake positions: (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2)\n> \n> Also, walls: borders x=0,7 y=0,7, so (5,2) is within bounds? x=5 between 1-6, y=2 between 1-6, no wall except borders, and internal obstacle at (3,6), which is not (5,2).\n> \n> (5,2) is not in snake positions, so it should be free.\n> \n> But is it a wall? Walls are x=0,7 and y=0,7, so (x,y) with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. For (5,2), x=5 not 0 or 7, y=2 not 0 or 7, so not wall. Internal obstacle only at (3,6), so (5,2) is empty.\n> \n> Similarly, right: (6,3) but that's the neck, moving right would be reverse, but since current direction is L, moving R is opposite, so not allowed? No instant reverse: cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\n> \n> Current direction is L, so I cannot move R (right) to (6,3), which is directly behind.\n> \n> Also, (6,3) is occupied, so even if I could, it would be collision.\n> \n> But since no reverse, I cannot choose R anyway.\n> \n> Possible moves from (5,3):\n> \n> - U: (5,4) — occupied by body, segment 3, collision\n> \n> - D: (5,2) — empty, as above\n> \n> - L: (4,3) — occupied by body, segment 5, collision\n> \n> - R: (6,3) — occupied and reverse, not allowed\n> \n> So only possible move is D, down to (5,2).\n> \n> Is that right? U to (5,4): (5,4) is in positions, yes, occupied.\n> \n> L to (4,3): (4,3) is position 5, occupied.\n> \n> R to (6,3): position 1, occupied and reverse not allowed.\n> \n> D to (5,2): not occupied, not wall, so only choice is D.\n> \n> But if I move down, to (5,2), then the snake moves: head to (5,2), and the tail moves forward, so the segment at (2,2) moves away, but since I didn't eat, length same.\n> \n> Now, after moving, the new positions: head at (5,2), then the body: previous head (5,3) becomes segment 1, then (6,3) segment 2, (6,4) segment 3, (5,4) segment 4, (4,4) segment 5, (4,3) segment 6, (4,2) segment 7, (3,2) segment 8, and tail (2,2) is removed? When snake moves without eating, the head moves to new cell, each segment moves to the next position, and the tail cell is vacated.\n> \n> So new positions: head (5,2), then (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2) — and (2,2) is no longer part of snake.\n> \n> Tail was (2,2), now it's gone, so snake positions: [(5,2), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2)] — length still 9.\n> \n> Now, I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n> \n> Food available:\n> \n> - (6,1): life span 2, so at turn 28, if not eaten, at turn 29 life span 1, turn 30 gone.\n> \n> - (1,3): life span 7, available until turn 34\n> \n> - (4,6): life span 10, available until turn 37\n> \n> All positive.\n> \n> But I have to avoid collisions and plan for survival.\n> \n> Currently, from (5,3), only move is down to (5,2), as above.\n> \n> Then at turn 29, head at (5,2), direction is down? After moving down, the new direction is D.\n> \n> Now from (5,2), possible moves:\n> \n> - U: (5,3) — but that's now the segment right behind the head? New positions: head (5,2), body: (5,3), (6,3), etc.\n> \n> (5,3) is adjacent and occupied, so moving U to (5,3) would be collision.\n> \n> - D: (5,1) — y=1, not wall? Walls y=0 and y=7, so y=1 is not wall, should be free. Is it occupied? Snake positions: (5,2), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2) — no (5,1), so free.\n> \n> - L: (4,2) — (4,2) is position 7 in new list? Positions: index 0: (5,2) head, 1: (5,3), 2: (6,3), 3: (6,4), 4: (5,4), 5: (4,4), 6: (4,3), 7: (4,2), 8: (3,2) — so (4,2) is segment 7, occupied.\n> \n> - R: (6,2) — not occupied, not wall.\n> \n> So from (5,2), possible moves: D to (5,1) or R to (6,2).\n> \n> Cannot U to (5,3) occupied, L to (4,2) occupied.\n> \n> Now, food at (6,1) is nearby.\n> \n> (6,1) is at bottom right.\n> \n> From (5,2), if I go R to (6,2), then next I can go down to (6,1) to eat the food, since life span is short.\n> \n> Life span: at turn 28, food at (6,1) has life span 2, so if not eaten on turn 28, on turn 29 it still exists with life span 1.\n> \n> Turn 29: if I move to (6,2) or (5,1), I can then on turn 30 go to (6,1) if possible.\n> \n> But (6,1) life span: at turn 28, life span 2, so turn 29: life span 1, turn 30: gone. So must be eaten by turn 29.\n> \n> On turn 28, I have to move down to (5,2) as only choice.\n> \n> Then turn 29: from (5,2), I can move to (6,2) or (5,1).\n> \n> If I move to (6,2) on turn 29, then I can move down to (6,1) on turn 30 to eat it, but on turn 30, food might be gone? Turn 30 is when it disappears.\n> \n> At turn 29, if I am at (6,2), and food at (6,1) is still there with life span 1, then on turn 30, I move down to (6,1) to eat it.\n> \n> But turn 30 is the last chance; if I don't eat on turn 29 or 30, it's gone.\n> \n> On turn 29, if I move directly to (6,1) from (5,2)? From (5,2) to (6,1) is not adjacent; adjacent cells are U,D,L,R, so diagonals not allowed. From (5,2), I can only go to (5,1), (5,3), (4,2), (6,2). (6,1) is not directly accessible; I have to go via (6,2) or (5,1).\n> \n> So to reach (6,1) from (5,2), I need two moves: e.g., to (6,2) then to (6,1), or to (5,1) then to (6,1) if possible.\n> \n> But (6,1) must be eaten by turn 29 or turn 30? Turn 29: if eaten on turn 29, it's fine. Turn 30: if life span was 1 on turn 29, and I eat on turn 30, is it still there?\n> \n> Life span: at turn t, if life span L, it is present during turn t.\n> \n> If not eaten, at turn t+1, life span L-1, and so on.\n> \n> So for (6,1) at turn 28: life span 2, present on turn 28.\n> \n> Turn 29: if not eaten on turn 28, life span 1, present on turn 29.\n> \n> Turn 30: if not eaten on turn 29, life span 0, not present on turn 30.\n> \n> So it can be eaten on turn 28 or 29. On turn 30, it is gone.\n> \n> Since on turn 28, I cannot reach it, only on turn 29 or later, but turn 30 gone, so only turn 29 possible to eat it.\n> \n> On turn 28, I move to (5,2).\n> \n> On turn 29, I need to be at (6,1) to eat it.\n> \n> From (5,2), I can move to (6,2) or (5,1) on turn 29.\n> \n> If I move to (6,2) on turn 29, I am at (6,2), not at (6,1), so I don't eat it on turn 29.\n> \n> To eat on turn 29, I need to move directly to (6,1) from (5,2), but I cannot, since not adjacent diagonally.\n> \n> So I cannot eat (6,1) on turn 29 from (5,2); the only way is to be at (6,1) on turn 29, but from (5,2) I can only go to adjacent cells, none is (6,1).\n> \n> Therefore, I cannot eat the food at (6,1) at all, because it requires being on that cell on turn 29, but from current position, I can only be at (5,2) on turn 29 if I move down on turn 28, but from (5,2) to (6,1) is not a possible move; it's not adjacent.\n> \n> Therefore, the food at (6,1) is unreachable for eating; I cannot get to it by turn 29.\n> \n> So I should ignore it and focus on other food.\n> \n> Now, back to turn 28: I must move down to (5,2) as only choice.\n> \n> Then on turn 29, at (5,2), I can move down to (5,1) or right to (6,2).\n> \n> Now, other food: (1,3) and (4,6).\n> \n> (1,3) is at left, near the tail or something.\n> \n> Snake tail is at (3,2) after move, but let's see positions after turn 28 move.\n> \n> After turn 28: head at (5,2), body: (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2)\n> \n> Tail at (3,2).\n> \n> Food at (1,3): value 1, life span 7, so plenty of time.\n> \n> (4,6): value 1, life span 10, also time.\n> \n> But (4,6) is above, but there's an obstacle at (3,6), which might block.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (3,6), so cell (3,6) is wall.\n> \n> Now, from (5,2) on turn 29, I can go to (5,1) or (6,2).\n> \n> I need to think about the board state and possible paths.\n> \n> Also, I must avoid collisions and plan for long-term survival.\n> \n> Current head position after turn 28: (5,2)\n> \n> Possible moves:\n> \n> - Down to (5,1)\n> \n> - Right to (6,2)\n> \n> If I go down to (5,1), then from there, I can go left to (4,1) or right to (6,1), but (6,1) has food, but it will be gone by turn 30, so on turn 29, if I go to (5,1), (6,1) is adjacent, but on turn 29, (6,1) has life span 1, so I can eat it on turn 29 by moving right to (6,1) from (5,1).\n> \n> Let's see:\n> \n> Turn 28: move down to (5,2) — head to (5,2)\n> \n> Turn 29: from (5,2), if I move down to (5,1), then head to (5,1), and (6,1) is adjacent.

It's turn 28, and I'm playing Snake on a 7x7 grid since the borders are x=0/x=7 and y=0/y=7, so the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think. Let me confirm the grid size.\n> \n> The walls are defined by border cells: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid is 8x8, but the snake can only be on cells from (1,1) to (6,6), I assume. Let's see the snake positions: [(5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2)]. All these coordinates are between 1 and 6, except... (5,3) to (2,2) all x and y from 2 to 6, so grid is 1 to 6 in both x and y? But walls are at x=0,7 and y=0,7, so cells (0,0) to (7,7) exist, but (0,y) and (7,y) for all y, and (x,0), (x,7) for all x are walls. Also, internal obstacle at (3,6).\n> \n> So playable cells are where both x and y are between 1 and 6 inclusive, except the obstacle at (3,6).\n> \n> Now, snake positions: head at (5,3), direction is L, which is left. So moving left.\n> \n> Food:\n> \n> - (6,1) with value 1, life span 2 (so disappears after 2 turns, including current turn? Life span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 28, life span 2 means it will disappear at turn 30? Let's see: life span N, disappears after N turns. Countdown decreases every turn, including current. So if at turn t, life span is L, then it disappears at turn t + L - 1? No.\n> \n> The description: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\", and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So for food at (6,1) with life span 2 at turn 28:\n> \n> - Turn 28: life span 2, can be eaten\n> \n> - Turn 29: if not eaten, life span decreases to 1\n> \n> - Turn 30: if not eaten, life span decreases to 0 and disappears? But it says \"disappears after N turns\", which might mean after N turns from now.\n> \n> Let's read carefully: \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> I think it's better to interpret: at turn t, with life span L, it will be present for L more turns, including turn t. So it disappears at the end of turn t + L - 1? Example:\n> \n> - At turn t, life span L: available on turn t.\n> \n> - After turn t, life span becomes L-1.\n> \n> - If L-1 > 0, available on turn t+1, and so on.\n> \n> - When life span reaches 0, it disappears.\n> \n> So for food at (6,1): life span 2 at turn 28.\n> \n> - Turn 28: available, life span 2\n> \n> - Turn 29: available, life span 1 (if not eaten)\n> \n> - Turn 30: not available, disappeared (life span 0)\n> \n> Similarly, other food:\n> \n> (1,3) value 1, life span 7: available from turn 28 to turn 28+6=34? Turn 28: life span 7, so available for 7 turns: turns 28,29,30,31,32,33,34. Disappears after turn 34.\n> \n> Life span N at turn t means it disappears after N turns, so available for N turns including t. So last available turn is t + N - 1.\n> \n> Turn t: available, life span N\n> \n> Turn t+1: available, life span N-1\n> \n> ...\n> \n> Turn t + N - 1: available, life span 1\n> \n> After that, gone.\n> \n> So for (1,3): life span 7 at turn 28, so available until turn 28 + 7 - 1 = 34.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,6): life span 10, available until turn 28 + 10 - 1 = 37.\n> \n> All food have value 1, so all positive food? The value is given as 1 for all, and it says \"value\" and \"life span\", so for (6,1) it's (x,y, life_span, value), but value is 1 for all, so all are positive food. No negative food in this state.\n> \n> Food positions: (6,1,2,1) so (x,y, life_span, value), and value=1 for all, so all positive food.\n> \n> Now, snake: head at (5,3), direction L, so moving left.

It's turn 30, and the grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So coordinates range from (0,0) to (7,7), but (0,0) is a wall corner, so playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6)? Let me check.\n> \n> Walls: border cells x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So any cell with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 is a wall. That means the playable grid is from x=1 to x=6 and y=1 to y=6? No, let's see: for example, x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x from 1 to 6 are free, similarly y from 1 to 6. But y=0 and y=7 are walls, so yes, playable area is (1,1) to (6,6).\n> \n> Internal obstacle: (3,6). So (3,6) is a wall cell.\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (6,2), and direction is R, which is right, so moving east.\n> \n> Snake body: [(6,2), (5,2), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2)] So head at (6,2), then to (5,2), which is left, so the snake is moving left? But head direction is R, which is right. That seems inconsistent.\n> \n> List the positions:\n> \n> Index 0: (6,2) head\n> \n> Index 1: (5,2) — this is left of head, x decreased\n> \n> Index 2: (5,3) — same x, y increased, so up\n> \n> Index 3: (6,3) — x increased, y same, so right\n> \n> Index 4: (6,4) — same x, y increased, up\n> \n> Index 5: (5,4) — x decreased, y same, left\n> \n> Index 6: (4,4) — x decreased, y same, left\n> \n> Index 7: (4,3) — same x, y decreased, down\n> \n> Index 8: (4,2) — same x, y decreased, down\n> \n> But the head direction is given as R, which is right. From (6,2), moving right would be to (7,2), but x=7 is a wall, so it can't move right. But the direction is the current heading, I think it means the snake was moving right to reach (6,2), but since (7,2) is wall, it must have changed direction? No, the direction is the current head direction, meaning from which direction it came or where it's facing?\n> \n> In the input, it says \"Snake Head Direction: R\", and in the rules, it says \"Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\", so it's the direction the head is currently facing, and you can't reverse it immediately.\n> \n> But at (6,2), if direction is R, that means it was moving right to get to (6,2), so the previous position was (5,2)? But in the positions, (5,2) is the second segment, so head at (6,2), previous was (5,2), which is left, so it moved from (5,2) to (6,2), so it moved right. Yes, so current direction is right, meaning it just moved right to (6,2).\n> \n> Now, from (6,2), possible moves: U (up to (6,3)), D (down to (6,1)), L (left to (5,2)), R (right to (7,2)).\n> \n> But (7,2) is wall, x=7, so cannot move right. Also, L to (5,2) is the body segment, but (5,2) is the second segment, so if it moves left to (5,2), that would be colliding with body? But rules say: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> Tail segment is the last one, which is (4,2). So moving to (5,2) is not tail, it's the neck or something.\n> \n> Body collision: head touches any body segment except that it can move to the tail cell because tail moves away.\n> \n> Specifically: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, the tail segment is (4,2). If head moves to a cell that will be vacated by the tail, it's ok, but only if it's the tail cell.\n> \n> In this case, from (6,2), moving L to (5,2): (5,2) is occupied by the second segment, which is not the tail. So moving to (5,2) would cause collision because the body is there and it won't move away immediately; only the tail moves when the head moves.\n> \n> When the snake moves, the head goes to a new cell, and the tail leaves its cell, so the cell that was tail becomes empty, but other body cells stay until the snake moves.\n> \n> So, if head moves to a cell that is currently occupied by a body segment, it's collision unless it's the tail cell, because tail will move, so that cell becomes free.\n> \n> Here, positions: index 0: head (6,2), index 1: (5,2), index 2: (5,3), ..., index 8: tail (4,2)\n> \n> So, cells occupied: (6,2), (5,2), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2)\n> \n> Now, from head at (6,2), possible moves:\n> \n> - U: to (6,3) — but (6,3) is occupied by index 3, which is a body segment, not tail. So collision.\n> \n> - D: to (6,1) — y=1, is that wall? Walls: y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=1 is not wall, should be free? But let's see if occupied.\n> \n> Current occupied cells: above list, no (6,1), so (6,1) might be free, but need to check walls and obstacles.\n> \n> Walls: border x=0,x=7,y=0,y=7, and internal (3,6).\n> \n> So (6,1): x=6, y=1. x=6 is not 0 or 7, y=1 not 0 or 7, and not (3,6), so not wall. Also not in snake positions, so should be free.\n> \n> - L: to (5,2) — but (5,2) is occupied by index 1, body segment. Not tail, so collision.\n> \n> - R: to (7,2) — x=7, wall, cannot.\n> \n> So only possible move is D, down to (6,1)? But U to (6,3) is occupied, L to (5,2) occupied, R wall, so only D is possible? But (6,1) is y=1, which is not wall, and not occupied, so yes.\n> \n> But is (6,1) within bounds? x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? y=1 is not wall, walls are y=0 and y=7, so y=1 is playable, similarly x=6 is playable.\n> \n> Playable area: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, since walls at x=0,7 and y=0,7.\n> \n> (6,1) is x=6, y=1, so yes, valid.\n> \n> But let's confirm the snake can move there.\n> \n> Also, direction: current direction is R (right), and moving D (down) is not opposite, opposite of R is L, which is left. So moving D is allowed.\n> \n> So from (6,2), only possible move without dying is D to (6,1).\n> \n> But that seems dire. Let me list all adjacent cells:\n> \n> - Up: (6,3) - occupied by body\n> \n> - Down: (6,1) - free, not wall\n> \n> - Left: (5,2) - occupied by body\n> \n> - Right: (7,2) - wall\n> \n> Yes, only down is safe.\n> \n> But the snake has to move, so it must go down to (6,1).\n> \n> Then on next turn, it can move from there.\n> \n> But we need to think multiple turns ahead and consider food.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> Food: (1,3,6,1) — I think this is (x,y, life_span, value)\n> \n> In input: \"( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 )\" so for first food: (1,3) with value 1 and life_span 6\n> \n> Second food: (4,6) with value 1 and life_span 8\n> \n> Both are positive food, since value +1.\n> \n> Life_span: for (1,3) is 6, meaning it disappears after 6 turns, including current turn? Countdown decreases every turn, including current.\n> \n> Current turn is t=30.\n> \n> So for food at (1,3): life_span 6, so it will disappear after turn 30 + 6 - 1? Let's see.\n> \n> \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) | Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So at turn t, if life_span is L, it will be present for L more turns, including turn t. So after turn t + L - 1, it disappears? Let's think.\n> \n> If countdown decreases every turn including current, then at turn t, countdown is L, meaning it has L turns left, including the current turn. So after L turns, it's gone. For example, if L=1, it disappears after this turn, so you can eat it only this turn.\n> \n> If L=2, it can be eaten this turn or next, but not after that.\n> \n> Similarly here, food at (1,3): life_span 6 at turn 30, so it can be eaten from turn 30 to turn 35 (since turns 30,31,32,33,34,35; 6 turns), and disappears after turn 35? Countdown: at turn 30, countdown=6, decreases to 5 at turn 31, ..., to 0 at turn 35, so after turn 35, it's gone. So last chance to eat is turn 35.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (4,6): life_span 8, so from turn 30 to turn 37.\n> \n> Now, positions: (1,3) is at x=1,y=3, which is playable.\n> \n> (4,6) is x=4,y=6. But y=6 is not wall? Walls y=0 and y=7, so y=6 is playable, but internal obstacle at (3,6), so (4,6) is not obstacle, should be free.\n> \n> Internal obstacle: (3,6), so (4,6) is different cell.\n> \n> Now, snake is at (6,2) head, and must move to (6,1) to survive this turn.\n> \n> But (6,1) might not have food, so no score, but survival first.\n> \n> After moving to (6,1), what next?\n> \n> Let me sketch the grid.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, but walls at x=0,7 and y=0,7, so playable cells: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6.\n> \n> Obstacle at (3,6), so (3,6) is wall.\n> \n> Snake positions: head (6,2), then (5,2), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2) tail.\n> \n> So let's list coordinates:\n> \n> - (6,2) head\n> \n> - (5,2)\n> \n> - (5,3)\n> \n> - (6,3)\n> \n> - (6,4)\n> \n> - (5,4)\n> \n> - (4,4)\n> \n> - (4,3)\n> \n> - (4,2) tail\n> \n> Now, after moving down to (6,1), new head position: (6,1)\n> \n> Then tail moves?

Subsequent moves are constrained until turn 33, where moving up (U) begins a direct path to the positive food at (4,6). The food at (1,3) is ignored because it is unreachable within its remaining lifespan (must be eaten by turn 35). Moving directly up from turn 33 to turn 37 allows the snake to reach and eat the food at (4,6) on turn 37, gaining +1 score while avoiding risks. The sequence is as follows:\n> \n> \\boxed{\n> Turn 30: D\n> Turn 31: L\n> Turn 32: L\n> Turn 33: U\n> Turn 34: U\n> Turn 35: U\n> Turn 36: U\n> Turn 37: U\n> }\n> \n> ### Main Thinking Conclusion\n> We prioritized immediate survival by moving down and left when no other safe options existed, then targeted the reachable food at (4,6) by moving directly upwards, as the food at (1,3) was too distant to eat before it expired. This strategy ensures long-term survival and scores +1 with minimal risk.\n",

There's an internal obstacle at (3,6), so that cell is blocked.\n> \n> Current turn is 31. Snake positions: head at (6,1), then (6,2), (5,2), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3). So the snake has 9 segments. Head direction is Down, meaning it was moving down last turn, so from (6,2) to (6,1)? Positions are listed head first: [(6,1), (6,2), ...]. If head is at (6,1) and direction is D (down), but down would decrease y, so from where? Let's think about movement.\n> \n> Direction is given as \"Snake Head Direction: D\", which I think means the direction it moved to get to the current head position. So, since head is at (6,1) and direction is D, it must have come from (6,2) because moving down to (6,1) from (6,2) – in standard coordinates, y increases up or down? The movement says U: (x,y+1), D: (x,y-1), so y=0 is bottom or top? It says U: (x,y+1), D: (x,y-1), and walls at y=0 and y=7. Typically in grids, y=0 might be bottom or top, but since U is y+1, and walls at y=0 and y=7, probably y=0 is the bottom, y=7 is top, so moving up increases y, down decreases y.\n> \n> But in the snake positions, head is at (6,1), which is near bottom if y=0 is bottom. Direction D means it moved down to (6,1), so from (6,2) to (6,1), since down decreases y.\n> \n> Snake positions: [(6,1), (6,2), ...] so head is (6,1), next is (6,2), which is above it if y increases upwards. Positions are listed from head to tail. So head at (6,1), then body at (6,2), which has higher y, so if y increases up, (6,2) is above (6,1), but direction is D, down, meaning the head moved from (6,2) to (6,1), decreasing y, so towards lower y, which might be south if we think north-up.\n> \n> But for movement, we need to know possible actions. Current head direction is D, so last move was down. Now, I can move U, D, L, R, but cannot do instant reverse, so I cannot move U (up) because that would be opposite to D (down). So possible moves: D (down), L (left), R (right). Not U.\n> \n> Now, head at (6,1). Walls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so (6,1) is at x=6, y=1. Moving down to (6,0) would hit wall y=0, so D is invalid. Moving left to (5,1), right to (7,1) but x=7 is wall, so R invalid. Only possible move is L to (5,1)? Let's see:\n> \n> - U: (6,1) to (6,2) – but reverse of D? Direction is D, so moving U is opposite, so instant reverse not allowed. So U not possible.\n> \n> - D: (6,1) to (6,0) – but y=0 is wall, so invalid.\n> \n> - L: (6,1) to (5,1) – x=5,y=1, within bounds? Playable area x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? Walls x=0 and x=7, so x=1 to 6 inclusive? Similarly y=1 to 6? But walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so cells with x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6 are playable, I think.\n> \n> x=0/x=7 means x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x from 1 to 6. Similarly y=1 to 6. So (6,1) to (5,1) is valid? x=5,y=1.\n> \n> R: (6,1) to (7,1) but x=7 is wall, invalid.\n> \n> D: (6,1) to (6,0) y=0 wall, invalid.\n> \n> U: (6,1) to (6,2) – but is this possible? Direction is D, so moving U is opposite, so instant reverse not allowed. Therefore, U is invalid because of no instant reverse rule.\n> \n> So only possible move is L to (5,1). Is that right?\n> \n> Let me confirm the positions. Snake: head (6,1), then (6,2), which is directly above if y increases up. But moving to (6,2) would be U, which is reverse of D, so not allowed. Yes.\n> \n> Moving to (5,1) is L, which is not reverse, so allowed.\n> \n> But (5,1) is not occupied by body? Body segments: (6,2), (5,2), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3). (5,1) is not in this list, so it's empty? But we have to consider food and obstacles.\n> \n> Obstacles: internal at (3,6), so (5,1) should be free.\n> \n> But let's list all occupied cells: snake positions: (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3). So (5,1) is not occupied, and not wall, so moving L to (5,1) should be possible.\n> \n> But is there food there? Food positions: (1,3,5,1) – this is probably (x,y, life_span, value) or (x,y, value, life_span)? The input says: ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 ) so for first food: (1,3) value 5, life span 1? That can't be right because value is 1 or -1, I think.\n> \n> Look: \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span: - (1, 3, 5, 1)\" – it says \" ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 ) \" but here it's written as (1,3,5,1), which might be (x,y, value, life_span) or (x,y, life_span, value)? I think it's a bit messy.\n> \n> From input: \" - (1, 3, 5, 1) \" and \" - (4, 6, 7, 1) \" etc.\n> \n> But the format says: ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 ) so for first one, it should be ((1,3), 5, 1) or something. But it's written as (1,3,5,1), which might be (x,y, value, life_span) or (x,y, life_span, value)?\n> \n> I think there's inconsistency. Let me read: \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value: - (1, 3, 5, 1)\" and earlier it says \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span\" so the order might be (x,y, value, life_span) or what?\n> \n> Look: \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span: - (1, 3, 5, 1)\" – probably it's (x,y, value, life_span), so (1,3) with value 5? But value should be +1 or -1 for food, no, it says \"Positive Food: Reward Value = +1\", but here it says value 5, that can't be.\n> \n> Perhaps I misread. \"Positive Food: Reward Value = +1\" but in the state, it might be different? No, the core rules say Positive Food has value +1, Negative has -1, but in this state, it's given as (1,3,5,1), which might mean x=1,y=3, value=5, life_span=1? But value 5 is not +1 or -1, so it must be that the value is the reward value, but it can be different? The core rules say for positive food, value is +1, but here it's 5, so perhaps in this game, food can have different values? But the core rules don't say that; it says \"Reward Value = +1\" for positive, \"-1\" for negative.\n> \n> But in the state, it's given as (1,3,5,1), so for this food at (1,3), value is 5, life span 1? But that contradicts the core rules. Perhaps I need to interpret it as per input.\n> \n> The input says: \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span: - (1, 3, 5, 1) - (4, 6, 7, 1) - (4, 4, 10, 1)\"\n> \n> And core rules say food has value and life span, but for positive food, value is +1, etc. Here values are 5,7,10, which are not 1, so perhaps in this game, food can have different values? But the core rules specify \"Reward Value = +1\" for positive, so I think there might be a mistake.\n> \n> Perhaps the \"5\" is the life span, and \"1\" is the value? Let's see the format: \" ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 ) \" but in the text, it's written without parentheses for the coordinate, so (1,3,5,1) might be x=1,y=3, value=5, life_span=1 or x=1,y=3, life_span=5, value=1?\n> \n> I think it's ambiguous, but the core rules say value is +1 or -1 for food, so it must be that the number after y is value, and last is life span, but 5 is not +1 or -1, so perhaps for this game, food can have values other than 1, or it's a mistake.\n> \n> Another possibility: \"value\" here might be the life span, and the reward is implied by sign? But the core rules say \"Positive Food: Reward Value = +1\", \"Negative Food: Penalty Value = -1\", so value is the reward.\n> \n> But in this state, it's given as numbers like 5,7,10, which are positive, so perhaps all food here is positive with different values? But the core rules don't specify that; it says for positive food, value is +1. So I think there's confusion.\n> \n> Perhaps the \"5\" is the life span, and \"1\" is the value. Let's look at the input: \" - (1, 3, 5, 1)\" and \" - (4, 6, 7, 1)\" so for first, if (x,y, life_span, value), then (1,3) life_span 5, value 1; (4,6) life_span 7, value 1; (4,4) life_span 10, value 1. And value 1 means positive food, since +1.\n> \n> That makes sense because all have value 1, and life span 5,7,10 respectively.\n> \n> Similarly, in the core rules, value is +1 for positive, so here all food are positive with value +1, and life span as given.\n> \n> Yes, that resolves it. So food at (1,3) with life span 5, value +1; (4,6) life span 7, value +1; (4,4) life span 10, value +1.\n> \n> But (4,4) is also a snake position? Snake positions include (4,4), which is the 8th segment from head: positions: (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3). So (4,4) is occupied by the snake body.\n> \n> Food at (4,4) is listed, but it's under the snake body. According to rules, food can spawn under body, but can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves onto it later.\n> \n> Similarly, other food: (1,3) and (4,6).\n> \n> Life span: for (1,3), life span 5, current turn 31, so it disappears after 5 turns, meaning on turn 36 or when? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 31, life span 5, after turn 31 it becomes 4, and so on, until 0, then disappears.\n> \n> Similarly for others.\n> \n> Now, back to movement: at turn 31, head at (6,1), direction D, possible moves:\n> \n> - U: to (6,2) but that is where the next body segment is, (6,2), so moving there would cause collision with body, since head touches body segment immediately.\n> \n> Also, U is opposite to D, so instant reverse not allowed.

No food at (5,1), so moving L to (5,1) is possible.\n> \n> But I need to think ahead for multiple turns.\n> \n> Also, there is food at (4,4) which is under the snake body, but we can eat it later if body moves away.\n> \n> Now, the snake is long, 9 segments, so moving will take time to reach food.\n> \n> Let me sketch the grid.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n> \n> Walls: borders and internal obstacle at (3,6).\n> \n> Snake positions:\n> \n> Head: (6,1)\n> \n> Body: (6,2), (5,2), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3)\n> \n> So the tail is at (4,3).\n> \n> Food:\n> \n> - (1,3): value +1, life span 5, so disappears at turn 31+5 = turn 36? Life span decreases each turn, so at turn 31, life span 5, after turn 31 it is 4, after turn 32 it is 3, ..., after turn 35 it is 1, after turn 36 it is 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten until turn 35 inclusive, I think. When head moves onto it on turn when life span >0.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,6): life span 7, so until turn 31+6=37?

The tail (4,3) is removed, since no growth.\n> \n> So new positions: [(5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4)]\n> \n> Tail is now at (4,4), which had food, but since tail moved away, the food at (4,4) is now exposed?

Let's read carefully.\n> \n> \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n> \n> So, when head moves onto the tail cell to eat the food, but the tail cell has food, and head moves there, eats it, then the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move, but since head is now on the cell where tail was, and tail is still there? Confusion.\n> \n> Suppose tail is at position T, with food on it. Head is adjacent to T, so head moves to T to eat the food. When head moves to T, it eats the food, so the snake grows: new head at T, and a new tail segment is added, but since it's growth, the tail position doesn't change immediately; the new segment is added at the end, so tail remains at T, but head is now also at T, so head and tail on same cell, collision, death.\n> \n> Yes, that makes sense.\n> \n> In this case, if head moves to a cell with food that is the current tail position, and head was adjacent, then after moving, head and tail on same cell, collision.\n> \n> To avoid, either head not adjacent, or food not on tail.\n> \n> In our case, for (4,4), it is the tail position at some point, but when we want to eat it, if tail is still there and head adjacent, it's dangerous.\n> \n> But in the earlier sequence, at turn 33, if head at (4,3), tail is at (5,4), which is adjacent to (4,4)? (4,4) and (5,4) are adjacent, but (4,4) is the food cell, which was tail but now vacated? In turn 32, when we moved to (4,1), tail moved from (4,4) to (5,4), so (4,4) is vacated and food is exposed. Tail is at (5,4).\n> \n> At turn 33, head at (4,2), if we move U to (4,3), then from (4,3), we can move U to (4,4) to eat.\n> \n> Now, at that point, tail is at (5,4), which is adjacent to (4,4) (left or right? (4,4) and (5,4) are horizontally adjacent).\n> \n> Head at (4,3) is below (4,4), so moving U to (4,4).\n> \n> Tail at (5,4) is to the right of (4,4), so adjacent.\n> \n> If head moves to (4,4), eats food, then new head at (4,4), and since food eaten, tail does not move, so tail still at (5,4). Now, head at (4,4) and tail at (5,4) are different cells, no collision. The danger only if the food is on the tail cell at the moment of eating, but here when we move to (4,4), it is not the tail cell; tail is at (5,4), so (4,4) is free with food, so eating is safe.\n> \n> The danger is when the food is on the current tail position, and head moves there from adjacent, then head and tail on same cell after growth.\n> \n> But here, (4,4) is not tail; tail is elsewhere, so eating at (4,4) is fine.\n> \n> Similarly, in general, as long as the food cell is not the current tail position when eating, it's ok.\n> \n> Back to planning.\n> \n> I need to maximize score, so eat food, but avoid risks.\n> \n> First, for turn 31, only choice is L to (5,1).\n> \n> Then turn 32, from (5,1), only choice is L to (4,1), as U to (5,2) is occupied.\n> \n> Then turn 33, from (4,1), I can move U to (4,2) or L to (3,1).\n> \n> Now, food at (1,3) is short-lived, only until turn 35.

Head direction is left, meaning it was moving left to (5,1) from previous position, but since positions are listed head first, previous head was probably at (6,1) or something. Let's trace the positions: from head to tail: (5,1) <- head, then (6,1), which is to the right, so if head is at (5,1) and next is (6,1), that means the head moved left to (5,1), so previous position was (6,1) but now (6,1) is the first body segment.

New positions: after move, positions are (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4)\n> \n> So (4,2) is not in list, so empty? x=4,y=2, not occupied, no wall.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,1) should be empty, no wall.\n> \n> Walls: borders x=0,7 y=0,7, and internal (3,6), so (3,1) is fine.\n> \n> So from (4,1), possible moves:\n> \n> - L to (3,1)\n> \n> - U to (4,2)\n> \n> - R to (5,1) occupied, invalid\n> \n> - D to (4,0) wall, invalid\n> \n> Also, no reverse issue since direction is L, moving L is same, U or D are perpendicular, R is reverse but invalid anyway.\n> \n> Now, we need to think about getting food.\n> \n> Food at (1,3) life span 4, so available turns 32,33,34,35. After turn 35 it disappears.\n> \n> Turn 32: we moved to (4,1), no food eaten.\n> \n> Turn 33: from (4,1), we can go to (3,1) or (4,2).\n> \n> (1,3) is at x=1,y=3. From current (4,1), we need to go up and left.\n> \n> Also, food at (4,6) and (4,4).\n> \n> (4,4) has food, and it's now free since tail moved away. But head is at (4,1), not adjacent.\n> \n> To eat (4,4), we need head to move there when it's free, which it is now.\n> \n> But (4,4) is at y=4, x=4, we are at (4,1), so we need to go up.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,6) is at y=6,x=4.\n> \n> But (4,6) is near the obstacle; (3,6) is wall, so (4,6) is accessible? (4,6) is x=4,y=6, and walls at y=6? y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=6 is the top row, not wall. Walls are x=0,x=7,y=0,y=7, so cells from (1,1) to (6,6) are playable, except (3,6) is specifically blocked, so (4,6) should be free.\n> \n> Internal obstacle (3,6), so (4,6) is not blocked.\n> \n> Now, life spans: (1,3) disappears after turn 35, so we have turns 33,34,35 to eat it if we can reach.\n> \n> (4,6) life span 6, so until turn 37.\n> \n> (4,4) life span 9, until turn 40.\n> \n> Now, (4,4) is close, at same x, y=4 vs y=1.\n> \n> From (4,1), if we go up to (4,2), then we can continue up.\n> \n> But let's plan multiple turns.\n> \n> Also, the snake body is long, 9 segments, so we need to avoid colliding with ourselves.\n> \n> Current positions after turn 32 move: head (4,1), body: (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4)\n> \n> So the area around (4,1): (4,2) is free, (3,1) is free, (5,1) occupied, (4,0) wall.\n> \n> For turn 33, if we move U to (4,2), then head to (4,2), body moves: new head (4,2), then (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4) and tail moves to (5,4)? Old tail was (5,4), segment 8 moves to old segment 7 position, which is (6,4), so new tail at (6,4).\n> \n> Positions: after moving U to (4,2):\n> \n> - Head: (4,2)\n> \n> - Body: old head (4,1) now segment 1\n> \n> - Then old segment 1 (5,1) now segment 2\n> \n> - Old segment 2 (6,1) now segment 3\n> \n> - Old segment 3 (6,2) now segment 4?

When snake moves without eating, tail moves off, so the last segment is removed, but the positions shift.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when moving to a new cell without food, head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, and the tail position is abandoned.\n> \n> So new positions: head at new position, then the previous positions from head to one before tail.\n> \n> After moving to (4,2) from (4,1), the new body starts from the old head position (4,1), then old segment 1 (5,1), old segment 2 (6,1), old segment 3 (6,2), old segment 4 (5,2), old segment 5 (5,3), old segment 6 (6,3), old segment 7 (6,4), and the old tail (5,4) is removed, so new tail is at (6,4).\n> \n> So new positions: (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4)\n> \n> Tail at (6,4).\n> \n> Food at (4,4) is still there, uneaten.\n> \n> If we move L to (3,1) on turn 33.\n> \n> From (4,1), move L to (3,1):\n> \n> New head (3,1)\n> \n> New body: (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4)  tail at (6,4) again, since old tail (5,4) removed.\n> \n> Old positions: head (4,1), then (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4)\n> \n> After move L to (3,1):\n> \n> New head (3,1)\n> \n> New segment 1: (4,1)\n> \n> New segment 2: (5,1)\n> \n> New segment 3: (6,1)\n> \n> New segment 4: (6,2)\n> \n> New segment 5: (5,2)\n> \n> New segment 6: (5,3)\n> \n> New segment 7: (6,3)\n> \n> New segment 8: (6,4)  // old segment 7\n> \n> Tail: old segment 8 (5,4) removed, so new tail at (6,4)\n> \n> Now, to reach (1,3), which is at (1,3), we need to go left from current position.\n> \n> From (4,1), if we go to (3,1) on turn 33, then from (3,1) we can go to (2,1) or (3,2), etc.\n> \n> (1,3) is at y=3, so we need to go up eventually.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,4) is at (4,4), which is above.\n> \n> But (4,4) has food, and we can eat it soon.\n> \n> Let's consider priorities.

Let's not get bogged down.\n> \n> Point is, from (4,3) on turn 35, (4,4) is a possible move, but (4,4) has food, but we're trying to reach (1,3).\n> \n> (4,3) to (1,3) is not close; |4-1|=3, |3-3=0, distance 3, so not reachable in one move.\n> \n> Similarly, from (3,2) on turn 34, to (1,3) not adjacent.\n> \n> So it seems impossible to reach (1,3) by turn 35 with the current position. From (4,1) on turn 33, the closest we can be to (1,3) on turn 34 is like (3,2) or (4,3), both not adjacent to (1,3). On turn 35, we can be at (2,2) or (3,3) or (4,4), etc., but (1,3) is only adjacent to (1,2), (1,4), (2,3), (0,3 invalid).\n> \n> To be at (2,3) on turn 35, for example, we need to reach it on turn 35 action.\n> \n> But from current, it's at least 3 moves away: e.g., (4,1) to (4,2) to (4,3) to (3,3) or (4,4), not (2,3).\n> \n> (4,1) to (3,1) to (3,2) to (3,3) or (2,2), not (2,3).\n> \n> (2,3) can be reached from (2,2), (2,4), (1,3), (3,3).\n> \n> From (4,1), to (3,1) turn 33, then (3,2) turn 34, then (2,2) or (3,3) turn 35, not (2,3).\n> \n> If from (4,1) turn 33 go U to (4,2), then U to (4,3) turn 34, then L to (3,3) turn 35 or U to (4,4), not (2,3).\n> \n> So to reach (2,3) by turn 35, we need to be at a neighbor on turn 34, like (2,2), (2,4), (1,3), (3,3).\n> \n> (1,3) is the food, (2,4) or (2,2) or (3,3).\n> \n> From turn 33 position, if at (3,1), we can go to (3,2) on turn 34, then to (3,3) on turn 35.\n> \n> Or from (4,2) on turn 33, to (3,2) on turn 34, then to (3,3) or (2,2) on turn 35.\n> \n> None of these are (2,3), and (2,3) is not directly reachable in time.\n> \n> Perhaps it's impossible to eat (1,3) because it's too far and we have only 3 turns. Manhattan distance from (4,1) to (1,3) is 3+2=5, and in 3 moves, we can cover at most 3 units, but since we have to avoid obstacles, it might not be reachable in 3 moves. The shortest path is 5 moves, so we can't reach it in 3 turns from here. On turn 33,34,35 we make moves, so after 3 moves, we are at a cell within distance 3, but (1,3) is distance 5 from (4,1), so indeed impossible to reach by turn 35.\n> \n> For example, after one move to (3,1) or (4,2), distance 4 or 4; after two moves, to e.g. (2,1) dist 3, or (3,2) dist 3, or (4,3) dist 2; after three moves, to (1,1) dist 2, or (2,2) dist 2, or (3,3) dist 2, or (4,4) dist 1, all still at least distance 1 from (1,3), and not adjacent, so can't reach on turn 35.\n> \n> Therefore, it's impossible to eat (1,3) before it disappears.

Now, if I move right to (5,1), since (5,1) is not the tail, and after movement, the body segment at (5,1) will move to where the head was, but at the moment of movement, the head is moving to (5,1), which is currently occupied, so it would be a collision because the body segment is still there until it moves.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, moving to a body segment is only safe if it is the tail segment, because the tail moves away, so the cell is vacated.\n> \n> Here, (5,1) is not the tail; it's the second segment.

So on the next turn, I cannot move right, because that would be opposite.\n> \n> But I can move up, down, or left, but down is invalid, so only up or left are possible and safe.\n> \n> Left is the same direction, so okay. Up is perpendicular, so okay.\n> \n> Cannot move right because it's opposite and also unsafe.\n> \n> So actions for turn 33: possible moves U or L.\n> \n> Now, I need to think multiple turns ahead to maximize score and survival.\n> \n> Food available:\n> \n> - (1,3): value 1, life span 3, so must be eaten by turn 35 (since life span decreases each turn, including current; turn 33: life span 3, so after turn 33, it has 2 turns left?

It's turn 34. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and an internal obstacle at (3,6).

So after turn t+L-1, it should be gone? Let's think.\n> \n> \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" – so at the start of turn t, if life_span is L, then during turn t, the countdown is L, and after turn t, it decreases to L-1.

Let's see an example.\n> \n> Suppose at turn t, food with life_span N is present.\n> \n> After turn t, countdown decreases to N-1.\n> \n> After turn t+1, countdown decreases to N-2, ..., after turn t + N -1, countdown decreases to 0, and then it disappears, so it is not present at turn t + N.\n> \n> Therefore, the food is available from turn t to turn t + N - 1.\n> \n> For (1,3) at turn 34, life_span=2, so it is available on turns 34 and 35, and disappears after turn 35, so not on turn 36.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,6) life_span=4, available turns 34,35,36,37.\n> \n> (4,4) life_span=7, available turns 34 to 40.\n> \n> (6,5) life_span=10, available turns 34 to 43.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (4,2), direction U (up).

Let's list the coordinates:\n> \n> - Head: (4,2)\n> \n> - Segment 1: (4,1)  // directly below head\n> \n> - Segment 2: (5,1)  // to the right\n> \n> - Segment 3: (6,1)  // right\n> \n> - Segment 4: (6,2)  // up\n> \n> - Segment 5: (5,2)  // left\n> \n> - Segment 6: (5,3)  // up\n> \n> - Segment 7: (6,3)  // right\n> \n> - Segment 8: (6,4)  // up\n> \n> Segment 8 is tail at (6,4).\n> \n> Now, grid size: walls at borders, so x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except internal wall at (3,6), so (3,6) is blocked.\n> \n> Playable cells: x=1,2,3,4,5,6; y=1,2,3,4,5,6; but (3,6) is wall, so not accessible.\n> \n> Also, snake occupies: (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4)\n> \n> Food at: (1,3), (4,6), (4,4), (6,5)\n> \n> (6,5) is food, but snake has segment at (6,4), so (6,5) might be adjacent.\n> \n> I need to plan actions for multiple turns ahead, at least 5 turns.\n> \n> Current turn t=34.\n> \n> Possible moves from head (4,2): since direction is U, I can move U, L, R, but not D because reverse is not allowed? Movement constraints: \"No instant reverse\": Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\n> \n> Current head direction is U, so last move was to (4,2) from (4,1), which is U, so moving down to (4,1) would be reverse, which is not allowed.\n> \n> So from (4,2), possible moves:\n> \n> - U: to (4,3)\n> \n> - D: to (4,1) but (4,1) is occupied by body segment, and also reverse direction? Reverse means moving directly opposite to current direction.\n> \n> Current direction is U, so opposite is D. Moving D would be reverse, which is not allowed. So cannot move D.\n> \n> - L: to (3,2)\n> \n> - R: to (5,2)\n> \n> But (5,2) is occupied by body segment? Let's see the positions: snake has (5,2) as segment 5, I think. Positions: head (4,2), then (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), ... (5,2) is a body segment at position (5,2), which is directly to the right of head (4,2)? (4,2) to (5,2) is east, right.\n> \n> (5,2) is occupied by the snake body, so moving to (5,2) would cause collision, unless it's the tail and tail moves away, but let's see.\n> \n> General rule: moving to a cell occupied by body is deadly, except if it's the tail and the tail moves away at the same time.\n> \n> In this case, (5,2) is not the tail; tail is (6,4). (5,2) is a body segment, so if head moves to (5,2), it collides with body, death.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,1) is occupied and also reverse direction, not allowed.\n> \n> Now, what about (4,3)? Is it free? (4,3) not in snake positions, not wall, so should be free.\n> \n> (3,2): not in snake positions, not wall, should be free.\n> \n> (5,2) is occupied, as above.\n> \n> Also, walls: x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls, so (4,3) is y=3, x=4, within 1-6, no wall.\n> \n> Similarly (3,2) x=3,y=2, not (3,6), so ok.\n> \n> (5,2) is occupied, so not possible.\n> \n> So possible moves from (4,2): U to (4,3) or L to (3,2).\n> \n> Now, I need to think ahead for multiple turns.\n> \n> Also, food: (1,3) is at (1,3), which is near top-left, but y=3, x=1.\n> \n> (4,6) at (4,6), which is top row, but internal wall at (3,6), so (4,6) might be accessible? x=4,y=6, not wall, since walls are borders only at y=0 and y=7? Borders are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so y=6 is not border, it's within 1-6? Grid: y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=1 to y=6 are playable. Similarly x=1 to x=6.\n> \n> (4,6) is at top row, y=6.\n> \n> But internal obstacle at (3,6), which is different.\n> \n> (4,6) is free, I think.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,4) at (4,4), and (6,5) at (6,5).\n> \n> Now, (6,5) is food, and snake tail is at (6,4), so if head moves to (6,5), it might be possible, but let's see the path.\n> \n> First, I need to choose an action for turn 34.\n> \n> Options: U to (4,3) or L to (3,2).\n> \n> If I go U to (4,3), then from there, I can go U to (4,4), but (4,4) has food, but it's not adjacent to tail or something? (4,4) food, if I eat it, snake grows, so new head at (4,4), and tail stays or moves? When you eat food, snake grows, so the tail doesn't move that turn.\n> \n> Rule: when eating positive food, length increases by one, so the new segment is added, but the tail doesn't move; the head moves to food, and a new segment is added at the tail position or something? Standard snake: when you eat, you move, head goes to food, and a new segment is added, so the tail doesn't move, length increases.\n> \n> In terms of positions: if head moves to food, and food is eaten, then the snake grows: the head is at the food cell, and a new tail segment is added where the tail was, so tail position stays the same for that turn, and next turn when you move, tail moves.\n> \n> But in collision, if head moves to a cell adjacent to tail and that cell has food, eating it might cause collision because the new tail grows and head is there? Let's see the special case.\n> \n> \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n> \n> In this case, for (4,4), is the head adjacent to tail? Tail is at (6,4), head is at (4,2), not adjacent; (4,2) to (6,4) is not adjacent, distance more than 1. Adjacent means sharing edge, so up, down, left, right.\n> \n> (4,2) to (6,4): Δx=2, Δy=2, not adjacent. So no issue.\n> \n> Similarly, other food.\n> \n> (6,5) is at (6,5), tail at (6,4), which is directly below, so adjacent vertically.\n> \n> If head is at (6,4) and moves to (6,5), but head is not at (6,4) now; head is at (4,2).\n> \n> But if head were to move to (6,5) when tail is at (6,4), since tail is adjacent, and (6,5) has food, eating it would be dangerous because: after eating, head is at (6,5), and since food eaten, snake grows, so a new segment is added at the current tail position (6,4), so now the snake has head at (6,5) and a segment at (6,4), but (6,4) is now a body segment, and if head is at (6,5), which is adjacent, but not colliding yet. The collision happens because the new tail grows at (6,4), and head is at (6,5), which are adjacent, but not overlapping. Collision is when head touches body, including itself.\n> \n> After eating, positions: head moves to food, say from previous head to new position, and a new segment is added at the tail end, so the tail position remains, and a new segment is there, so the tail doesn't move.\n> \n> For example, if snake is moving and head moves to food, the body follows, but since food eaten, the tail stays put, so the snake grows by one.\n> \n> So in this case, if head moves to a cell that was occupied by tail, but tail is moving away? The rule says: food can be under body, but only eaten if body moves away and head moves on.\n> \n> But for tail specifically, if head moves to food at tail position, and tail is moving away, it might be ok, but the \"Tail Reward Danger\" specifies when head is adjacent and moves to the food on tail cell.\n> \n> Let's read: \"If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake\"\n> \n> The tail cell has food, meaning the cell where the tail is located has food on it.\n> \n> So, if the cell occupied by the tail has food, and the head is adjacent to that cell, and head moves onto it to eat, then it kills the snake because after eating, head is at that cell, and a new tail segment is grown at that position? No.\n> \n> When you eat food at the tail position: suppose tail is at position P, and P has food. Head moves to P to eat it. Since P was occupied by tail, but when head moves to P, the tail is still there? At the same turn, head moves to P, which is the tail position.\n> \n> In snake movement, when head moves, the tail also moves if not eating, but if eating, tail doesn't move.\n> \n> Standard: in a turn, if no food eaten, head moves to new cell, each segment moves to the next position, so tail cell is vacated.\n> \n> If food eaten, head moves to food cell, new segment is added at the previous tail position, so tail doesn't move; the cell where tail was remains occupied.\n> \n> But if the food is on the tail cell, and head moves to it, then: head moves to the tail cell, which now has food. Since food is eaten, the snake grows, so the head is now at that cell, and a new segment is added at the current tail position, which is that same cell? Confusion.\n> \n> Let's clarify with positions.\n> \n> Suppose at turn t, tail is at T, and T has food. Head is at H, adjacent to T.\n> \n> At turn t, head moves to T to eat the food.\n> \n> After move: head is now at T. Since food eaten, a new segment is added. The new segment is added where? Typically, it's added to the tail end, so at the position where the tail was before moving, but since no moving for tail, the tail position T now has the head and the new segment? Inconsistency.\n> \n> I think there's a misunderstanding.\n> \n> In standard snake mechanics:\n> \n> - When no food eaten: head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the next position, so the tail cell is vacated.\n> \n> - When food eaten: head moves to new cell (the food cell), each body segment moves to the next position, but since food eaten, a new segment is added at the previous tail position, so the tail doesn't move; the cell that was tail remains occupied, and a new segment is there.\n> \n> But if the food is on the tail position, then when head moves to that position, it is moving to a cell that was occupied by the tail. But at the moment of move, the tail is still there, so moving to a body cell causes collision, unless it's the tail and tail moves away.\n> \n> But in the case of eating, if the food is under the tail, and head moves to it, since the tail is moving away (if no eat) or staying (if eat), it's messy.\n> \n> The rule specifies: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> Also, \"Tail Reward Danger\" is a special case.\n> \n> For the tail cell: if the tail cell has food, and the head is adjacent, then eating it kills the snake because after the move, the head is at that cell, and a new tail segment is grown at that cell, so it's like the head and body are on the same cell, collision.\n> \n> Let's see the text: \"because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n> \n> After eating, head is at the food cell, and a new segment is added at the position where the tail was, so for that turn, the head is at the food cell, and the new segment is at the same cell? That doesn't make sense; it must be that the new segment is added separately.\n> \n> I think I have a confusion in snake growth.\n> \n> Typically in snake, when food is eaten, the head moves to the food cell, and the body follows, but the last segment (tail) does not move, so the snake grows by one cell at the tail end. So the new segment is added at the position that was the tail before the move, but since the tail didn't move, it's the same position.\n> \n> Positions: suppose at turn t, snake positions: [H, B1, B2, ..., T] where T is tail.\n> \n> If no food eaten, move: new head at new position, then [new head, H, B1, B2, ...] and the last position is removed, so new tail is B2 or whatever.\n> \n> If food eaten, new head at food position, then [new head, H, B1, B2, ..., T] and the tail T stays, so new positions are [food, H, B1, B2, ..., T], so the new segment is added at T, but T was already there, so it's like the tail segment is duplicated? No, in the list, T is still there, and we add a new segment at the end, so positions become: [food, H, B1, B2, ..., T, T] but that can't be, same cell occupied twice.\n> \n> I think I have it wrong.\n> \n> Standard way: the snake is a list of segments. When moving without eating, the head moves to a new cell, and each segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so the tail position is vacated.\n> \n> When eating, the head moves to the food cell, each segment moves to the previous position, but instead of removing the tail, we keep it, so the new tail is the old tail position, and a new segment is added at that position, so the snake length increases by one.\n> \n> For example: positions [A,B,C] with C tail.\n> \n> Head at A, tail at C.\n> \n> Move to new cell D, no eat: new positions [D,A,B], tail B.\n> \n> If eat at D: new positions [D,A,B,C], so C is still there, new tail C, length increased.\n> \n> The cell that was tail C is now occupied by the new segment, but it's the same cell.\n> \n> If the food was on the tail cell, say C has food, and head moves to C.\n> \n> But C is occupied by tail, so moving to it would be collision.\n> \n> However, since the tail is moving away (if not eating) or staying (if eating), it's allowed only if the tail moves away.\n> \n> But for eating, it's specific.\n> \n> The rule says: \"the body moves away\" for food under body.\n> \n> For tail, if food on tail cell, and head moves to it, if we are not eating, it would be collision, but we are eating, so it's different.\n> \n> But the \"Tail Reward Danger\" addresses this: if head is adjacent to tail and the tail cell has food, eating it causes death because after move, head is at that cell, and a new tail segment is grown there, so they occupy the same cell, collision.\n> \n> Similarly, if not adjacent, it might be ok.\n> \n> In this state, for (6,5) food, tail is at (6,4), so the tail cell is (6,4), which has no food; food is at (6,5), which is different cell.\n> \n> So for (6,5), it's not on the tail cell, so no danger.\n> \n> Tail cell is (6,4), no food there. Food is at (6,5), so if head moves to (6,5), it can eat it safely, as long as it's not adjacent to tail in a way that causes issue, but (6,5) is not the tail cell.\n> \n> The danger is only when eating the food that is on the tail cell itself.\n> \n> In this case, no food on tail cell, so no problem.\n> \n> Back to planning.\n> \n> Current head at (4,2), possible moves: U to (4,3) or L to (3,2).\n> \n> If I go U to (4,3), then from (4,3), I can go U to (4,4), which has food with life span 7, so I can eat it on turn 35 or later.\n> \n> From (4,3), I can also go L to (3,3) or R to (5,3).\n> \n> (5,3) is occupied by snake body?

If after decrease, S-1 = 0, it disappears at the end of the turn. Or something.\n> \n> Let's clarify with an example. Suppose food has life span 1 at turn t.

So new head (4,6), body: seg1 at (4,5), seg2 at (4,4), ..., up to seg9 at (5,3), and a new segment is added at the old tail position, which is (5,3)? When eating, the tail doesn't move, so the last position remains, and a new segment is added there? No.\n> \n> After moving to food: head moves to food cell, the body segments move as normal, but since tail doesn't move, the segment that was the tail stays, and the snake grows.\n> \n> So positions: new head at (4,6), then the previous head (4,5) becomes body, so seg1 at (4,5), then seg2 at old seg1 (4,4), seg3 at old seg2 (4,3), ..., and so on, down to seg9 at old seg8 (5,2)? Before move, positions were: head (4,5), seg1 (4,4), seg2 (4,3), seg3 (4,2), seg4 (4,1), seg5 (5,1), seg6 (6,1), seg7 (6,2), seg8 (5,2), seg9 (5,3) tail.\n> \n> After moving head to (4,6) and eating food: new head (4,6), then new seg1 at previous head position (4,5), new seg2 at previous seg1 (4,4), new seg3 at previous seg2 (4,3), new seg4 at previous seg3 (4,2), new seg5 at previous seg4 (4,1), new seg6 at previous seg5 (5,1), new seg7 at previous seg6 (6,1), new seg8 at previous seg7 (6,2), new seg9 at previous seg8 (5,2), and since food eaten, the previous tail (5,3) does not move, so it becomes a new segment, say new seg10 at (5,3). So now snake has 11 segments, tail at (5,3).\n> \n> And (5,3) was previously occupied, so no new free cell.\n> \n> Now, after eating at (4,6), I am at (4,6), with direction U.\n> \n> From there, possible moves: U, but y=6, y=7 is wall, so U to (4,7) is invalid, wall.\n> \n> D to (4,5), but (4,5) is now body, occupied.\n> \n> L to (3,6), but (3,6) is internal obstacle, wall, cannot move.\n> \n> R to (5,6).\n> \n> (5,6) should be free, I think.

So the snake has 10 segments. Head direction is Up, meaning it just moved to (4,5) from (4,4), so last move was Up.\n> \n> **Food Items:**\n> - (4,6) with value 1, life_span 2. So it disappears after turn 37 + 2 = turn 39? Life_span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 37, life_span=2 means it has 2 turns left: after turn 37, it will have 1 turn left, and after turn 38, it disappears. So it can be eaten on turn 37 or 38.\n> - (6,5) with value 1, life_span 7. So it will last until turn 37 + 7 - 1? Let's clarify: life_span N means it disappears after N turns from now, including the current turn. So if eaten on turn t, it must be before it disappears. For (4,6): life_span=2 at turn 37, so:\n> - Turn 37: life_span=2 (can be eaten)\n> - Turn 38: life_span=1 (can be eaten)\n> - Turn 39: life_span=0, disappears, cannot be eaten.\n> - Similarly, (6,5): life_span=7, so it will be available until turn 37 + 6 = turn 43? Turn 37: life_span=7, turn 38:6, ..., turn 43: life_span=1, turn 44:0, disappears.

Let's list in order: indices: 0:head (4,5), 1: (4,4), 2: (4,3), 3: (4,2), 4: (4,1), 5: (5,1), 6: (6,1), 7: (6,2), 8: (5,2), 9: (5,3) — so tail is (5,3).\n> \n> Food at:\n> - (4,6) — above head? (4,5) to (4,6) is Up, but y=6 is not wall? Walls at y=0 and y=7, so y=6 is within bounds, but there's an internal obstacle at (3,6), but (4,6) is not (3,6), so it should be free? (4,6) is a different cell.\n> \n> (4,6) is at x=4,y=6. Walls: border y=7 is wall, but y=6 is fine. Internal obstacle (3,6), which is left of (4,6), so (4,6) should be accessible unless specified otherwise.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,5) at x=6,y=5, and (1,6) at x=1,y=6.\n> \n> Now, for turn 37, head at (4,5), direction U, so possible moves:\n> - Up: to (4,6) — but (4,6) has food! And it's directly above.\n> - Left: to (3,5)\n> - Right: to (5,5)\n> - Down: to (4,4) — but (4,4) is the body segment, and it's not the tail? Moving to body segment would cause collision, except if it's the tail and the tail moves away.\n> \n> Collision rules: head touches any body segment except the tail, but if head moves to tail position, it's ok because tail will move, but only if the tail is not staying, meaning that after movement, the head and tail positions are updated.\n> \n> Standard snake: when head moves to a cell, if that cell is occupied by body, it dies, except if it's the current tail cell, because the tail will move forward, so that cell becomes free.\n> \n> In this case, for a move to (x,y), if (x,y) is part of the body and not the tail position at that moment, it collides. If it is the tail position, then after moving, the head is there and tail moves, so no collision.\n> \n> Here, possible moves from (4,5):\n> - Up to (4,6): what is at (4,6)? It has food, and is it occupied by snake? Snake positions: (4,5), (4,4), etc., no (4,6), so it's free, but has food. Food can be eaten if head moves there.\n> - Left to (3,5): is (3,5) occupied? Snake: (4,5), (4,4), ..., no (3,5), so should be free? But walls: internal obstacle at (3,6), but (3,5) is below it, not wall unless specified. Walls are only borders and (3,6), so (3,5) should be free.\n> - Right to (5,5): similarly, (5,5) not in snake positions, so free.\n> - Down to (4,4): (4,4) is the body segment at index 1. Since it's not the tail, moving there would cause collision because head touches body.\n> \n> Tail is at (5,3), so (4,4) is not tail, so moving down to (4,4) is invalid, collision.\n> \n> Also, cannot move down because of instant reverse? Direction is U, so moving down is opposite, so invalid for that reason too. But even if it were allowed, it would be collision.\n> \n> So valid moves: Up, Left, Right.\n> \n> Now, Up to (4,6): (4,6) has food with value +1, life_span 2. If I move there, I eat it, snake grows by one segment, so length becomes 11.\n> \n> But there's a special case: Tail Reward Danger. If head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake. Here, head is at (4,5), tail is at (5,3). Are they adjacent? (4,5) and (5,3): difference in x is 1, y is 2, so not adjacent; adjacent means sharing a side, so up, down, left, right. (4,5) and (5,3) are diagonal? x differs by 1, y by 2, so not adjacent. Adjacent cells would be like (4,5) and (4,6), (4,4), (3,5), (5,5). Tail at (5,3) is not adjacent to head; it's two cells away.\n> \n> So no tail reward danger here.\n> \n> Therefore, moving Up to (4,6) seems good, I eat food immediately.\n> \n> But I need to think long-term. Life_span of (4,6) is 2, meaning it disappears after turn 39, so it can be eaten on turn 37 or 38. If I don't eat it now, I might eat it later, but it's risky because it might not be accessible or I might die.\n> \n> Other food: (6,5) with life_span 7, so plenty of time, and (1,6) with life_span 10.\n> \n> Also, I need to avoid risks. Let's see the grid layout.\n> \n> Snake body: from head (4,5) down to (4,1), then right to (5,1), right to (6,1), up to (6,2), left to (5,2), up to (5,3). So the tail is at (5,3), and (5,2) is above it, etc.\n> \n> After moving, the tail will move depending on the path.\n> \n> Now, for long-term survival, I should consider paths to other food and potential dead ends.\n> \n> First, if I move Up to (4,6) on turn 37:\n> - Head moves to (4,6), eats food, so new head position (4,6), and snake grows, so new body: head (4,6), then previous head (4,5), then (4,4), ..., up to (5,3), and a new segment, so length 11. Tail is still (5,3) for now, but after next move, it will move.\n> \n> When snake eats, it grows, so after eating, the tail doesn't move immediately; the growth happens at the next move or something? I need to clarify the movement.\n> \n> Standard snake mechanics: when the head moves to a food cell, it eats it, and the snake grows, meaning that the tail does not move on that turn, so the length increases by one. Then on subsequent turns, when no food is eaten, tail moves.\n> \n> In this case, on turn 37, if head moves to (4,6) and eats food, then the snake positions become: new head (4,6), then the previous positions: (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), and since it grows, the tail stays at (5,3), but (5,3) was tail, now it's part of body, and no new tail movement, so positions: [(4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (5,3)] — 11 segments, tail at (5,3).\n> \n> Then, for next move, tail will move away.\n> \n> Head direction after moving Up would be Up.\n> \n> Now, from (4,6), possible moves: Up, Down, Left, Right.\n> \n> But (4,6): y=6, Up to (4,7) — but y=7 is wall, since border y=7, so cannot go Up.\n> \n> Left to (3,6) — but (3,6) is internal obstacle, wall, so cannot go Left.\n> \n> Right to (5,6) — is that free? y=6, x=5, should be free unless wall or snake. Walls: no walls there, snake positions: after move, snake has (4,6) to (5,3), no (5,6), so should be free.\n> \n> Down to (4,5) — but (4,5) is the body segment now, index 1, not tail, so collision if move down.\n> \n> So from (4,6), only possible moves are Right to (5,6) or Down to (4,5) but Down is body, so only Right to (5,6) is valid?

No:\n> \n> x=0 and x=7 are walls, meaning columns x=0 and x=7 are walls. Similarly, y=0 and y=7 are walls. So the grid has walls on the outer edges, so cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are inaccessible. Playable area: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? Let's see the snake positions: (4,6) is head, y=6 is the top row? Since y=7 is wall, so y=6 is the highest y before wall.\n> \n> Similarly, x=1 to x=6 should be playable, but x=0 and x=7 walls.\n> \n> Also, internal obstacle at (3,6), so (3,6) is blocked.\n> \n> Now, snake: head at (4,6), direction Up. But (4,6) is at y=6, and moving Up would go to y=7, which is a wall! That can't be right.\n> \n> y=7 is a wall, so if head is at (4,6) and moving Up, to (4,7), but y=7 is wall, so it would collide. But the head direction is given as U, so it must be possible? Perhaps I have the coordinate system wrong.\n> \n> Let's clarify the coordinate system. Typically in such grids, (0,0) is bottom-left or top-left? But here, walls at y=0 and y=7, so let's assume y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top, so moving Up increases y.\n> \n> Head at (4,6), moving Up to (4,7), but y=7 is wall, so that should be invalid. But the state says head direction is U, and it's at (4,6), so maybe (4,6) is not at the top? y=6 is one below y=7 wall.\n> \n> y=7 is wall, so moving to y=7 is death. Similarly, y=0 is wall at bottom.\n> \n> In the snake positions, we have (4,1), (4,2), etc., y=1 is above y=0 wall, so playable y from 1 to 6, since y=0 and y=7 walls.\n> \n> Similarly, x from 1 to 6.\n> \n> Head at (4,6), which is the top row, since y=6 is max playable y. Moving Up to (4,7) would hit wall, so it must not be moving Up now? But direction is given as U, meaning it was moving Up to get to (4,6), but from where? Snake positions: head (4,6), then (4,5), so it came from (4,5) to (4,6) by moving Up. (4,5) to (4,6) is Up, and (4,6) is at y=6, so next move Up to (4,7) is impossible because wall. Therefore, the snake cannot move Up; it must choose a different direction.\n> \n> The head direction is the current moving direction, but for the next move, I need to choose a new action, considering I cannot move opposite instantly.\n> \n> Current head direction is U, meaning last move was Up to (4,6). Now, for turn 38, I need to choose an action: U, D, L, or R.\n> \n> But U is towards wall, so moving U would kill the snake by wall collision. So I must not choose U.\n> \n> Possible moves: D (down, to (4,5)), L (left, to (3,6)), or R (right, to (5,6)).\n> \n> But (3,6) has an internal obstacle? Internal obstacle at (3,6), so (3,6) is wall, cannot move there.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: [(3,6)], so (3,6) is blocked.\n> \n> Therefore, from (4,6), possible moves:\n> \n> - U: to (4,7) - wall, death\n> \n> - D: to (4,5) - but (4,5) is part of the snake body? Snake positions: [(4,6), (4,5), ...] so (4,5) is the second segment, which is the body. Moving to (4,5) would cause body collision because head touches body segment.\n> \n> The snake positions list: head (4,6), then (4,5), (4,4), etc. So (4,5) is the immediate body segment. If I move down to (4,5), head touches (4,5), which is a body segment, so collision, death.\n> \n> Similarly, L to (3,6): but (3,6) is internal obstacle, wall, so collision.\n> \n> R to (5,6): is (5,6) free? Let's see what's at (5,6).\n> \n> First, list all occupied cells.\n> \n> Snake positions: (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (5,3)\n> \n> So body segments: (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (5,3)\n> \n> (5,3) is the tail? Positions: head (4,6), then (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (5,3). So tail is (5,3).\n> \n> Now, for (5,6): is it occupied? Not in snake positions, and not a wall, except borders. Walls are x=0,x=7,y=0,y=7, and internal (3,6). So (5,6) should be free, since x=5, y=6, within 1-6, and not obstacle.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,6) is head, so moving R to (5,6) should be possible, as long as no collision.\n> \n> But (5,6) is empty, I think.\n> \n> Also, food positions: (6,5) and (1,6), so not at (5,6).\n> \n> So from (4,6), possible actions:\n> \n> - U: to (4,7) - wall, invalid\n> \n> - D: to (4,5) - body segment, collision, invalid\n> \n> - L: to (3,6) - internal obstacle, wall, invalid\n> \n> - R: to (5,6) - seems free, no wall, no body? Body positions: all have y<=5 or x with y<=2, except head. (5,6) not in list, so yes, free.\n> \n> Therefore, only possible move is R to (5,6).\n> \n> Is that right? L is to (3,6) which is wall, so invalid. U wall, D body, so only R is valid.\n> \n> But let's confirm the body collision rule. When moving, if head moves to a cell with body, it dies. But exception: if it's the tail, and tail moves, it might be ok, but here (4,5) is not tail, it's the second segment, so moving to (4,5) would cause collision because the body is still there when head moves.\n> \n> The rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> Here, (4,5) is not the tail; tail is (5,3). So (4,5) is a body segment, and if head moves to (4,5), it collides with body.\n> \n> Similarly, moving to tail cell might be ok if tail moves away.\n> \n> But here, only R to (5,6) is possible.\n> \n> So for turn 38, I must move R to (5,6).\n> \n> Now, after moving, the snake will have new head at (5,6), and the body follows: since it moves, the tail will move to... let's think about the movement.\n> \n> When snake moves, head goes to new position, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, so the tail segment is removed, but if it eats food, tail doesn't remove, it grows.\n> \n> Currently no food at (5,6), so moving to (5,6) doesn't eat food, so snake moves, head to (5,6), then the segment that was at head (4,6) becomes body at (4,6)? No.\n> \n> Standard snake: when moving without eating, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so the last segment (tail) is removed.\n> \n> Positions: before move: [H: (4,6), B1: (4,5), B2: (4,4), ..., up to tail (5,3)]\n> \n> After moving right to (5,6): new head at (5,6), then B1 moves to old head position? No.\n> \n> The segments: after move, head is at new position (5,6), and the body segments follow the path: so the first body segment goes to where head was, which is (4,6), but (4,6) was head, now it's the position for the first body segment.\n> \n> Let's list the positions in order.\n> \n> Current positions: index 0: head (4,6), 1: (4,5), 2: (4,4), 3: (4,3), 4: (4,2), 5: (4,1), 6: (5,1), 7: (6,1), 8: (6,2), 9: (5,2), 10: tail (5,3)\n> \n> After moving right, head moves to (5,6). Then, each subsequent segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> So segment 1 (which was at (4,5)) moves to where segment 0 was, which is (4,6). But segment 0 is now at (5,6), so segment 1 moves to (4,6).\n> \n> Then segment 2 moves to where segment 1 was, (4,5)? No.\n> \n> The new position of segment i is the old position of segment i-1 for i>0.\n> \n> Old positions: seg0: (4,6), seg1: (4,5), seg2: (4,4), ..., seg10: (5,3)\n> \n> After move: new seg0 (head) at (5,6)\n> \n> new seg1 at old seg0 position: (4,6)\n> \n> new seg2 at old seg1 position: (4,5)\n> \n> new seg3 at old seg2 position: (4,4)\n> \n> ...\n> \n> new seg5 at old seg4 position?

It's turn 38, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so coordinates from (0,0) to (7,7), with walls on the borders. There's also an internal obstacle at (3,6).\n> \n> Snake positions: Head is at (4,6), and body segments follow: (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (5,3). The head direction is Up, which makes sense since it's at (4,6) and previous was (4,5), so moving up.\n> \n> Food positions: There are two food items:\n> \n> - (6,5) with value 1 and life span 6\n> \n> - (1,6) with value 1 and life span 9\n> \n> Life span decreases each turn, including the current one, so for (6,5), life span 6 means it will disappear after 6 turns from now, including turn 38. Similarly, (1,6) has life span 9.\n> \n> I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score and prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> First, let's map out the grid to visualize.\n> \n> Grid size: 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7). Walls on all borders, so the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think? Let's confirm:\n> \n> Border cells: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. So yes, playable cells are x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? No:\n> \n> x=0 and x=7 are walls, meaning columns x=0 and x=7 are walls. Similarly, y=0 and y=7 are walls. So the grid has walls on the outer edges, so cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are inaccessible. Playable area: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? Let's see the snake positions: (4,6) is head, y=6 is the top row? Since y=7 is wall, so y=6 is the highest y before wall.\n> \n> Similarly, x=1 to x=6 should be playable, but x=0 and x=7 walls.\n> \n> Also, internal obstacle at (3,6), so (3,6) is blocked.\n> \n> Now, snake: head at (4,6), direction Up. But (4,6) is at y=6, and moving Up would go to y=7, which is a wall! That can't be right.\n> \n> y=7 is a wall, so if head is at (4,6) and moving Up, to (4,7), but y=7 is wall, so it would collide. But the head direction is given as U, so it must be possible? Perhaps I have the coordinate system wrong.\n> \n> Let's clarify the coordinate system. Typically in such grids, (0,0) is bottom-left or top-left? But here, walls at y=0 and y=7, so let's assume y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top, so moving Up increases y.\n> \n> Head at (4,6), moving Up to (4,7), but y=7 is wall, so that should be invalid. But the state says head direction is U, and it's at (4,6), so maybe (4,6) is not at the top? y=6 is one below y=7 wall.\n> \n> y=7 is wall, so moving to y=7 is death. Similarly, y=0 is wall at bottom.\n> \n> In the snake positions, we have (4,1), (4,2), etc., y=1 is above y=0 wall, so playable y from 1 to 6, since y=0 and y=7 walls.\n> \n> Similarly, x from 1 to 6.\n> \n> Head at (4,6), which is the top row, since y=6 is max playable y. Moving Up to (4,7) would hit wall, so it must not be moving Up now? But direction is given as U, meaning it was moving Up to get to (4,6), but from where? Snake positions: head (4,6), then (4,5), so it came from (4,5) to (4,6) by moving Up. (4,5) to (4,6) is Up, and (4,6) is at y=6, so next move Up to (4,7) is impossible because wall. Therefore, the snake cannot move Up; it must choose a different direction.\n> \n> The head direction is the current moving direction, but for the next move, I need to choose a new action, considering I cannot move opposite instantly.\n> \n> Current head direction is U, meaning last move was Up to (4,6). Now, for turn 38, I need to choose an action: U, D, L, or R.\n> \n> But U is towards wall, so moving U would kill the snake by wall collision. So I must not choose U.\n> \n> Possible moves: D (down, to (4,5)), L (left, to (3,6)), or R (right, to (5,6)).\n> \n> But (3,6) has an internal obstacle? Internal obstacle at (3,6), so (3,6) is wall, cannot move there.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: [(3,6)], so (3,6) is blocked.\n> \n> Therefore, from (4,6), possible moves:\n> \n> - U: to (4,7) - wall, death\n> \n> - D: to (4,5) - but (4,5) is part of the snake body? Snake positions: [(4,6), (4,5), ...] so (4,5) is the second segment, which is the body. Moving to (4,5) would cause body collision because head touches body segment.\n> \n> The snake positions list: head (4,6), then (4,5), (4,4), etc. So (4,5) is the immediate body segment. If I move down to (4,5), head touches (4,5), which is a body segment, so collision, death.\n> \n> Similarly, L to (3,6): but (3,6) is internal obstacle, wall, so collision.\n> \n> R to (5,6): is (5,6) free? Let's see what's at (5,6).\n> \n> First, list all occupied cells.\n> \n> Snake positions: (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (5,3)\n> \n> So body segments: (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (5,3)\n> \n> (5,3) is the tail? Positions: head (4,6), then (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (5,3). So tail is (5,3).\n> \n> Now, for (5,6): is it occupied? Not in snake positions, and not a wall, except borders. Walls are x=0,x=7,y=0,y=7, and internal (3,6). So (5,6) should be free, since x=5, y=6, within 1-6, and not obstacle.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,6) is head, so moving R to (5,6) should be possible, as long as no collision.\n> \n> But (5,6) is empty, I think.\n> \n> Also, food positions: (6,5) and (1,6), so not at (5,6).\n> \n> So from (4,6), possible actions:\n> \n> - U: to (4,7) - wall, invalid\n> \n> - D: to (4,5) - body segment, collision, invalid\n> \n> - L: to (3,6) - internal obstacle, wall, invalid\n> \n> - R: to (5,6) - seems free, no wall, no body? Body positions: all have y<=5 or x with y<=2, except head. (5,6) not in list, so yes, free.\n> \n> Therefore, only possible move is R to (5,6).\n> \n> Is that right? L is to (3,6) which is wall, so invalid. U wall, D body, so only R is valid.\n> \n> But let's confirm the body collision rule. When moving, if head moves to a cell with body, it dies. But exception: if it's the tail, and tail moves, it might be ok, but here (4,5) is not tail, it's the second segment, so moving to (4,5) would cause collision because the body is still there when head moves.\n> \n> The rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> Here, (4,5) is not the tail; tail is (5,3). So (4,5) is a body segment, and if head moves to (4,5), it collides with body.\n> \n> Similarly, moving to tail cell might be ok if tail moves away.\n> \n> But here, only R to (5,6) is possible.\n> \n> So for turn 38, I must move R to (5,6).\n> \n> Now, after moving, the snake will have new head at (5,6), and the body follows: since it moves, the tail will move to... let's think about the movement.\n> \n> When snake moves, head goes to new position, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, so the tail segment is removed, but if it eats food, tail doesn't remove, it grows.\n> \n> Currently no food at (5,6), so moving to (5,6) doesn't eat food, so snake moves, head to (5,6), then the segment that was at head (4,6) becomes body at (4,6)? No.\n> \n> Standard snake: when moving without eating, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so the last segment (tail) is removed.\n> \n> Positions: before move: [H: (4,6), B1: (4,5), B2: (4,4), ..., up to tail (5,3)]\n> \n> After moving right to (5,6): new head at (5,6), then B1 moves to old head position? No.\n> \n> The segments: after move, head is at new position (5,6), and the body segments follow the path: so the first body segment goes to where head was, which is (4,6), but (4,6) was head, now it's the position for the first body segment.\n> \n> Let's list the positions in order.\n> \n> Current positions: index 0: head (4,6), 1: (4,5), 2: (4,4), 3: (4,3), 4: (4,2), 5: (4,1), 6: (5,1), 7: (6,1), 8: (6,2), 9: (5,2), 10: tail (5,3)\n> \n> After moving right, head moves to (5,6).

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State\n\nFirst, let's summarize the current state of the game at Turn \\( t_0 = 40 \\):\n\n- **Grid**: 8x8 grid with borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Playable area is x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, with an internal obstacle at (3,6).\n- **Snake**:\n  - Positions: [(6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)]\n    - Head at (6,6), tail at (6,2).\n  - Current direction: R (right).\n- **Food**:\n  - (6,5): value +1, life span 4.\n  - (1,6): value +1, life span 7.\n  - (2,4): value +1, life span 10.\n\n### Possible Moves at Turn 40\n\nFrom the head position (6,6) with current direction R, the possible moves are:\n\n1. **Up (U)**: (6,7) → y=7 is a wall → Invalid.\n2. **Down (D)**: (6,5) → Within bounds, not occupied by snake, has food.\n3. **Left (L)**: (5,6) → Occupied by snake's body segment → Collision → Invalid.\n4. **Right (R)**: (7,6) → x=7 is a wall → Invalid.\n\nAdditionally, the \"no instant reverse\" rule means we cannot move in the opposite direction of the current direction (R's opposite is L). However, L is already invalid due to collision, so this doesn't affect our options here.\n\n**Valid Move**: Only Down (D) to (6,5).\n\n### Checking for Safety\n\nBefore moving to (6,5), let's ensure it's safe:\n\n- **Food at (6,5)**: Positive food (+1), so eating it increases length by 1.\n- **Tail Reward Danger**: Head is at (6,6), tail at (6,2). Adjacent to head are (5,6), (7,6), (6,7), (6,5). Tail is at (6,2), not adjacent to head → No danger.\n- **Collision**: (6,5) is not occupied by the snake's body → Safe.\n\n### Consequences of Moving Down to (6,5)\n\n- **New Head Position**: (6,5).\n- **Body Growth**: Since we eat food, the tail doesn't move. The new body will be:\n  - Head: (6,5)\n  - Body: [(6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)]\n    - Total length increases from 11 to 12.\n- **Food Update**: (6,5) is eaten and removed.\n\n### Future Considerations\n\nAfter moving to (6,5), the next moves would involve navigating towards other food items while avoiding collisions. However, since the current task is to decide the immediate action at Turn 40, we don't need to plan further ahead for this decision.\n\n### Verifying Other Options\n\nIs there any other possible move at Turn 40?\n\n- **Up, Left, Right**: All lead to walls or collisions → Invalid.\n- **Down**: Only valid option.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAt Turn 40, the only valid and safe move is **Down (D)** to (6,5), where we can eat the positive food without any immediate risks.\n\n\\boxed{D}",

So moving right from (6,6) to (7,6) is impossible; it's a wall collision.\n> \n> But the snake is at (6,6) with direction R, so on this turn, I need to choose an action that isn't necessarily the same as the direction, but I have to consider movement constraints.\n> \n> The head direction is given as R, meaning it was moving right to get to (6,6). But now, for turn 40, I need to choose a new action: U, D, L, or R.\n> \n> But from (6,6), moving R to (7,6) is invalid because it's a wall. So I cannot choose R.\n> \n> Also, no instant reverse: since current direction is R, I cannot move L (left) on this turn, because that would be opposite direction.\n> \n> So possible moves from (6,6) with current direction R:\n> \n> - U: up to (6,7) but y=7 is wall, so invalid.\n> \n> - D: down to (6,5) – y=5 is within 1 to 6? y from 1 to 6, so (6,5) should be playable.\n> \n> - L: left to (5,6) – but (5,6) is occupied by the snake body, segment 1.\n> \n> - R: right to (7,6) – wall, invalid.\n> \n> Let's list possible moves:\n> \n> - Up: (6,6) to (6,7) – y=7 is wall, so not possible.\n> \n> - Down: (6,6) to (6,5) – let's see if it's occupied or wall. (6,5) is not a wall; walls are only borders and (3,6). (6,5) is within x=1-6, y=1-6, and not (3,6), so it should be free? But there is food at (6,5), but that doesn't block movement; I can move there to eat it.\n> \n> Moving to a cell with food is fine; I eat it and grow.\n> \n> But first, is (6,5) occupied by snake? Snake positions: (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), etc. (6,5) is not in the list, so it's empty or has food.\n> \n> Food is at (6,5), so I can move there.\n> \n> But I need to check if moving to (6,5) is safe.\n> \n> - Left: (6,6) to (5,6) – but (5,6) is occupied by the snake body, segment 1. So if I move left to (5,6), I collide with my own body, which is deadly.\n> \n> - Right: (7,6) – wall, invalid.\n> \n> - Down: (6,5) – seems possible.\n> \n> Up is invalid, left is body collision, right is wall, so only down is possible? But down to (6,5).\n> \n> But let's confirm: (6,5) has food, but moving there should be fine, unless there's a special rule.\n> \n> Also, tail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it kills, but here tail is at (6,2), which is not adjacent to head (6,6). Adjacent means sharing an edge, so (6,6) is adjacent to (5,6), (7,6) wall, (6,7) wall, (6,5). (6,5) is down, and tail is at (6,2), which is not adjacent; it's two away down? (6,6) to (6,5) is adjacent down, but (6,5) is not tail; tail is (6,2), so no issue.\n> \n> (6,5) has food, positive, so if I move down, I eat it and grow.\n> \n> But life span of (6,5) is 4, meaning it disappears after 4 turns including current, so on turn 40, if I move to it, I eat it.\n> \n> Now, but I need to think about future moves.\n> \n> Possible actions: since current direction is R, and I cannot move opposite, which is L, and U and R are invalid, so only D is possible? But let's make sure.\n> \n> Head at (6,6), direction R. Possible moves:\n> \n> - U: (6,7) - y=7 wall, invalid\n> \n> - D: (6,5) - valid cell\n> \n> - L: (5,6) - occupied by body, collision\n> \n> - R: (7,6) - wall, invalid\n> \n> So indeed, only down is possible for this turn. I have to move down to (6,5).\n> \n> Is that right? What about the no instant reverse? Since direction is R, moving L would be reverse, but L is invalid anyway. U and R are invalid, so only D is available.\n> \n> So for turn 40, I must move down to (6,5).\n> \n> But let's confirm the state.\n> \n> Snake positions: head (6,6), then (5,6), which is left, so moving left to (5,6) would collide, yes.\n> \n> (6,5) is below, and it's not occupied, so I can move there.\n> \n> Also, (6,5) has food with value +1 and life span 4.\n> \n> So if I move down, I eat the food, so my length increases by 1.\n> \n> After eating, the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move, I think. Standard snake rules: when you eat food, you grow, so the tail stays in place for that turn, meaning the new segment is added at the head position after moving.\n> \n> Let's clarify the movement.\n> \n> When the snake moves, the head moves to a new cell, and each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead. If no food eaten, the tail segment is removed. If food eaten, the tail segment is not removed, so the snake grows by one segment.\n> \n> In this case, if I move to (6,5) and eat food, then the new head position is (6,5), and the body segments follow: the old head (6,6) becomes new segment 1, then (5,6) becomes segment 2, and so on, but since I ate food, the tail doesn't move, so the last segment (tail) stays, meaning the snake has one more segment.\n> \n> Current positions: let's index them.\n> \n> Before move:\n> \n> - Head: (6,6)\n> \n> - Body: (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)  // 10 body segments, total 11 cells.\n> \n> After moving down to (6,5) and eating food:\n> \n> - New head: (6,5)\n> \n> - New body: the previous head position becomes the first body segment, so (6,6) is now body segment 1\n> \n> - Then the next segments: (5,6) becomes body segment 2, (4,6) becomes segment 3, (4,5) segment 4, and so on, up to (6,1) becomes segment 10, and (6,2) is still tail, but since I ate food, the tail doesn't move, so (6,2) remains, and a new segment is added, so the tail is still (6,2), but now there is an extra segment at the end? Let's think.\n> \n> Typically in snake, when you eat, you add a new segment at the tail, but the tail position doesn't change immediately; instead, when moving, the tail stays in place if food eaten.\n> \n> Sequence: head moves to new cell. If the new cell has food, then the tail does not move, so the snake grows by one cell. The new head is at the food cell, and the previous head becomes the new first body segment, and so on, with the tail remaining.\n> \n> So positions after move:\n> \n> - New head: (6,5)\n> \n> - New segment 1: (6,6)  // previous head\n> \n> - New segment 2: (5,6)  // previous seg1\n> \n> - New segment 3: (4,6)  // previous seg2\n> \n> - New segment 4: (4,5)  // previous seg3\n> \n> - New segment 5: (4,4)  // previous seg4\n> \n> - New segment 6: (4,3)  // previous seg5\n> \n> - New segment 7: (4,2)  // previous seg6\n> \n> - New segment 8: (4,1)  // previous seg7\n> \n> - New segment 9: (5,1)  // previous seg8\n> \n> - New segment 10: (6,1)  // previous seg9\n> \n> - New segment 11: (6,2)  // previous seg10, and since food eaten, tail remains, so (6,2) is still there, and no removal, so now 12 segments.\n> \n> Previous tail was (6,2), and it stays, so positions: head (6,5), then (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2) — 12 positions.\n> \n> Yes.\n> \n> Now, the food at (6,5) is eaten, so it disappears.\n> \n> Other food: (1,6) and (2,4).\n> \n> Life span: (6,5) had life span 4, but eaten, gone.\n> \n> (1,6) life span 7, so after turn 40, it has 6 turns left? Life span decreases every turn including current, so on turn 40, life span 7 means it will disappear after turn 46? Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So for food at turn t with life span L, it will disappear after turn t + L - 1? Example: if at turn t, life span L, then after L turns, it is gone. Since countdown decreases every turn including current, on turn t, countdown = L, after turn t, countdown = L-1, ..., after turn t + L - 1, countdown=1, then after that turn, it disappears, so on turn t + L, it is no longer present.\n> \n> But when we say \"after N turns\", it might be ambiguous.\n> \n> Standard: if countdown decreases on each turn, starting from L at turn t.\n> \n> After turn t (current), countdown becomes L-1.\n> \n> After turn t+1, countdown L-2, ..., after turn t + L - 1, countdown=1, then after turn t + L - 1, when we process the next turn, it disappears before turn t+L.\n> \n> But for movement, when the head moves to a cell on turn T, if food is there, it is eaten.\n> \n> If on turn T, food has life span >0, it can be eaten.\n> \n> After eaten or life span 0, it disappears.\n> \n> In this case, at turn 40:\n> \n> Food (6,5): life span 4, so on turn 40, it can be eaten; if not eaten, after turn 40, life span decreases to 3, and so on, until after turn 43, life span 1, then after turn 43, it disappears, so not present on turn 44.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,6): life span 7, so disappears after turn 46 (since 40 + 7 - 1 = 46? Let's see: after turn 40, life span 7 -> 6; after turn 41, 5; ... after turn 46, life span 0, disappears before turn 47. So present from turn 40 to 46, can be eaten if head moves to it during those turns.\n> \n> Turn t, life span L: can be eaten on turns from t to t + L - 1 inclusive? On turn t, life span L; after turn t, it becomes L-1; on turn t+1, life span L-1, etc.\n> \n> So it exists as long as life span >0. On turn when life span is reduced to 0, it disappears after that turn.\n> \n> But for eating, if head moves to it on a turn when life span >0, it is eaten.\n> \n> For (6,5) at turn 40: life span 4 >0, so can be eaten.\n> \n> If I eat it on turn 40, it's gone.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,6): life span 7, so can be eaten from turn 40 to 46 inclusive.\n> \n> (2,4): life span 10, can be eaten from turn 40 to 49.\n> \n> Back to turn 40 action.\n> \n> As I thought, only possible move is down to (6,5), eating the food.\n> \n> So for turn 40, I must choose D.\n> \n> Then, after that, the snake is at: head (6,5), body: (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)\n> \n> And head direction: since I moved down, the new head direction is D.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan for future turns.\n> \n> Food left: (1,6) and (2,4)\n> \n> (1,6) is at x=1,y=6, which is top-left corner, almost.\n> \n> (2,4) is at x=2,y=4.\n> \n> Snake is now at (6,5), with a long body.\n> \n> I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> First, from (6,5), possible moves: U, D, L, R, but with no instant reverse.\n> \n> Current head direction is now D (down), since I just moved down.\n> \n> So possible moves: cannot move up (opposite of down).\n> \n> Can move down, left, or right.\n> \n> Now, positions:\n> \n> - Down: (6,4) - but what is there? y=4, within bounds.

It's turn 41. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and an internal obstacle at (3,6). So, the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are on the borders, meaning cells like (0,y) for all y, (7,y) for all y, (x,0) for all x, (x,7) for all x, and specifically (3,6) is blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (6,5), then (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2). So the snake has 12 segments. Head direction is down, which is D. That means the snake was moving down to (6,5) from (6,6), I think? Let's see: positions are given head first, so head at (6,5), then body at (6,6), which is above it, so since head is at (6,5) and direction is D, that makes sense; it moved down to (6,5) from (6,6) or something. Positions: [(6,5), (6,6), ...] so head is (6,5), next is (6,6), which is north of head? (6,5) to (6,6) is up, but direction is D, down? Inconsistency here.\n> \n> Let's plot this. Assume (0,0) is bottom-left, so y increases up or down? Typically in grids, y=0 is bottom or top? But here, walls are y=0 and y=7, so let's see the positions.\n> \n> Snake positions: head (6,5), then (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2).\n> \n> If y=0 is bottom, then (4,1) to (4,2) is up, (6,1) to (6,2) up, so y increases as we go up, I think. But head at (6,5), direction D down, which would be decreasing y. But (6,5) to next body (6,6) has y=6 > y=5, so if y increases up, (6,6) is above (6,5). But direction is D, down, meaning the head was previously at a higher y? Let's think about movement.\n> \n> Head direction is D, down, meaning the snake is moving down, so from previous position, it was at a cell with higher y, to lower y. But in positions, head is (6,5), and the next segment is (6,6), which has higher y, so that must be the body, not the previous head position. The positions list includes all segments, with head first. So at turn 41, head is at (6,5), and it just moved there from, say, (6,6) or something. But (6,6) is the second position, so before moving, head was at (6,6), it moved down to (6,5), so now positions: head (6,5), and body includes (6,6) which is where head was.\n> \n> Similarly, tail is at (6,2).\n> \n> Now, direction is D, down, so for next move, since it just moved down, I cannot move up immediately because of no instant reverse. So possible moves from (6,5) with direction D: down to (6,4), left to (5,5), right to (7,5) but x=7 is wall, so right invalid. x=7 is border wall, so (7,5) is wall, cannot go there.\n> \n> Also, down to (6,4): is that within bounds? y=4, x=6, walls at x=0,7 y=0,7, so (6,4) should be ok unless obstacle. Obstacles: internal at (3,6), so (6,4) is clear.\n> \n> Left to (5,5): should be ok.\n> \n> Up to (6,6): but (6,6) is occupied by the body, and it's the second segment. But since the snake will move, when I move, the head moves to a new position, and the tail moves away, so I can go to (6,6) only if it's free after move, but (6,6) is currently occupied, but after I move, if I go up to (6,6), but (6,6) is the next segment, so if I go there, head would collide with body? Let's see collision rules.\n> \n> Collision: head touches any body segment except that if it's the tail, and tail moves, it might be ok. Rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, if I move to a cell that will be the tail position, but after move, the tail moves, so it's safe if I'm moving to where the tail is now, and tail moves away.\n> \n> In this case, if I move up to (6,6), which is currently occupied by the first body segment. After I move, if I go to (6,6), and since the snake moves, the tail will move from (6,2) to wherever, but (6,6) is not the tail; tail is at (6,2). So (6,6) is a body segment that won't move away; it will become the second segment or something.\n> \n> Let's think carefully.\n> \n> Current positions: let's index them: head S0 = (6,5), S1 = (6,6), S2 = (5,6), S3 = (4,6), S4 = (4,5), S5 = (4,4), S6 = (4,3), S7 = (4,2), S8 = (4,1), S9 = (5,1), S10 = (6,1), S11 = (6,2)  // tail\n> \n> After one move, if I move in direction X, head moves to new position, and each segment moves to the previous position of the segment before it. So tail S11 moves away from (6,2).\n> \n> If I move up to (6,6): (6,6) is currently occupied by S1. After I move to (6,6), the new head is at (6,6), and S1 will move to where? The new position: head at (6,6), then S0 moves to (6,6)? No.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, the body follows, so the segment that was at S1 will move to where S0 was, but since head moves to new cell, the first body segment goes to the old head position.\n> \n> In this case: if I move head to new position, say new_head.\n> \n> Then new body: the segment that was S1 will be at old S0, which is (6,5). S2 will be at old S1 (6,6), and so on, down to tail moving from old S11 to new position based on the chain.\n> \n> Specifically, if I move head to (6,6), but (6,6) is currently S1. After move, head is at (6,6), which was S1, and S1 will move to old head (6,5), S2 to old S1 (6,6), but old S1 was (6,6), so S2 moves to (6,6), which is where head is now? Let's simulate.\n> \n> Current positions:\n> \n> - Head: (6,5)\n> \n> - S1: (6,6)\n> \n> - S2: (5,6)\n> \n> - etc.\n> \n> If I move head up to (6,6):\n> \n> - New head: (6,6)\n> \n> - Then S1 (which was at (6,6)) moves to where head was, (6,5)\n> \n> - S2 (which was at (5,6)) moves to where S1 was, (6,6)\n> \n> But where S1 was is (6,6), and new head is at (6,6), so S2 moves to (6,6), but head is already there? So collision at (6,6) between head and S2.\n> \n> Yes, that's a body collision. Because S2 is moving to (6,6) which is now occupied by head.\n> \n> Similarly, the cell (6,6) had a body segment, and after move, it will have multiple segments if I move there.\n> \n> Rule: you can move into the tail cell because tail moves away, but for other body cells, it's a collision.\n> \n> In this case, (6,6) is not the tail; it's the second segment, so moving there would cause collision.\n> \n> Specifically, after move, head is at (6,6), and S2 moves to (6,6), same cell, so collision.\n> \n> Therefore, moving up to (6,6) is invalid, collision.\n> \n> Similarly, moving to any body cell except the tail is collision.\n> \n> Now, what about (5,6)? That's S2, currently occupied. If I move left to (5,5), that's different.\n> \n> Possible moves from (6,5):\n> \n> - Down: to (6,4) - is it free? Currently, no snake there?

It's turn 42, and the grid is 8x8 since borders are x=0, x=7 and y=0, y=7, so coordinates from (0,0) to (7,7). There's an internal obstacle at (3,6).\n> \n> Snake positions: Head at (6,4), then (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1). That's 12 segments. Head direction is down (D), which means the snake is moving downward, so from (6,4) to (6,5) is down, but (6,5) to (6,6) is also down, then (6,6) to (5,6) is left? Let's list the positions in order:\n> \n> - Head: (6,4)\n> \n> - Next: (6,5)  // so from (6,4) to (6,5) is down\n> \n> - Then (6,6)  // down again\n> \n> - Then (5,6)  // left, since x decreased\n> \n> - Then (4,6)  // left\n> \n> - Then (4,5)  // down? y decreased from 6 to 5, so up? y=6 to y=5 is decreasing y, so upward? I need to be careful with coordinates.\n> \n> Typically in grids, y increases upward or downward? The movement: U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), so y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top? Let's see the border: y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=0 is bottom row, y=7 is top row. So increasing y is upward, decreasing y is downward.\n> \n> U: (x, y+1) — upward\n> \n> D: (x, y-1) — downward\n> \n> L: (x-1, y) — left\n> \n> R: (x+1, y) — right\n> \n> Now snake positions:\n> \n> - (6,4) head\n> \n> - (6,5) — so from head to this, y increased, so upward? But head direction is given as D, down. Contradiction?\n> \n> Head direction is the current moving direction. From turn 41 to 42, the snake moved to (6,4) with direction D. Positions are listed as [(x0,y0), (x1,y1), ...] with head first, so (6,4) is head at turn 42, and it moved there from previous position.\n> \n> Previous head position must be (6,3) or something? Positions: (6,4) is head, then (6,5), which is the next segment. Since the snake moves, the head was previously at (6,3) if it moved down to (6,4), but (6,3) is not in the positions? Positions are current positions.\n> \n> Let's read the positions in order: head (6,4), then body segments: (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)\n> \n> If head is at (6,4) and moving down (D), that means on the next move, it will go to (6,3) if it continues down.\n> \n> But the position after head is (6,5), which has higher y, so that's above the head. Since y increases upward, (6,5) is north of (6,4). So the snake body is going upward from head to (6,5), but the head is moving downward? That means the snake just turned or something.\n> \n> Perhaps the positions are listed from head to tail, so the head is at (6,4), and the first body segment is at (6,5), which is directly above it. Then (6,6) above that, then (5,6) left, etc.\n> \n> But the head direction is D, down, meaning that on the previous move, it came from above? Let's think about the movement.\n> \n> At turn 42, head is at (6,4), and it is moving downward, so on turn 41, head was at (6,5) or something?

It's turn 42, and the grid is 8x8 since borders are x=0, x=7 and y=0, y=7, so coordinates from (0,0) to (7,7). There's an internal obstacle at (3,6).\n> \n> Snake positions: Head at (6,4), then (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1). That's 12 segments. Head direction is down (D), which means the snake is moving downward, so from (6,4) to (6,5) is down, but (6,5) to (6,6) is also down, then (6,6) to (5,6) is left? Let's list the positions in order:\n> \n> - Head: (6,4)\n> \n> - Next: (6,5)  // so from (6,4) to (6,5) is down\n> \n> - Then (6,6)  // down again\n> \n> - Then (5,6)  // left, since x decreased\n> \n> - Then (4,6)  // left\n> \n> - Then (4,5)  // down? y decreased from 6 to 5, so up? y=6 to y=5 is decreasing y, so upward? I need to be careful with coordinates.\n> \n> Typically in grids, y increases upward or downward? The movement: U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), so y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top? Let's see the border: y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=0 is bottom row, y=7 is top row. So increasing y is upward, decreasing y is downward.\n> \n> U: (x, y+1) — upward\n> \n> D: (x, y-1) — downward\n> \n> L: (x-1, y) — left\n> \n> R: (x+1, y) — right\n> \n> Now snake positions:\n> \n> - (6,4) head\n> \n> - (6,5) — so from head to this, y increased, so upward? But head direction is given as D, down. Contradiction?\n> \n> Head direction is the current moving direction. From turn 41 to 42, the snake moved to (6,4) with direction D. Positions are listed as [(x0,y0), (x1,y1), ...] with head first, so (6,4) is head at turn 42, and it moved there from previous position.\n> \n> Previous head position must be (6,3) or something? Positions: (6,4) is head, then (6,5), which is the next segment. Since the snake moves, the head was previously at (6,3) if it moved down to (6,4), but (6,3) is not in the positions? Positions are current positions.\n> \n> Let's read the positions in order: head (6,4), then body segments: (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)\n> \n> If head is at (6,4) and moving down (D), that means on the next move, it will go to (6,3) if it continues down.\n> \n> But the position after head is (6,5), which has higher y, so that's above the head. Since y increases upward, (6,5) is north of (6,4). So the snake body is going upward from head to (6,5), but the head is moving downward? That means the snake just turned or something.\n> \n> Perhaps the positions are listed from head to tail, so the head is at (6,4), and the first body segment is at (6,5), which is directly above it. Then (6,6) above that, then (5,6) left, etc.\n> \n> But the head direction is D, down, meaning that on the previous move, it came from above? Let's think about the movement.\n> \n> At turn 42, head is at (6,4), and it is moving downward, so on turn 41, head was at (6,5) or something? Positions include (6,5), which is a body segment now.\n> \n> The snake moves one cell per turn. On turn 41, head was at some position, and it moved to (6,4) on turn 42.\n> \n> Since head direction is D, it must have come from (6,5) to (6,4), because moving down to (6,4) means from (6,5) to (6,4) since y decreases.\n> \n> But (6,5) is now the first body segment, which makes sense: on turn 41, head was at (6,5), it moved down to (6,4) on turn 42, so now (6,5) is the neck, and the rest follows.\n> \n> The body: after (6,5) is (6,6), which was the head on turn 40 or earlier.\n> \n> Similarly, the tail is at (6,1).\n> \n> Now, food positions:\n> \n> - (1,6) with value 1, life span 5\n> \n> - (2,4) with value 1, life span 8\n> \n> Both are positive food since value +1.\n> \n> Life span: disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current. So for (1,6), life span 5 at turn 42, so it will disappear after turn 46 (since turn 42: count 5, turn 43:4, turn 44:3, turn 45:2, turn 46:1, turn 47: gone? Countdown decreases every turn, including current.\n> \n> \"Life-span disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So at turn t when food is present, life span L, it will be there for L more turns, including turn t.

It's turn 44, and the grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, meaning the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think? Let me confirm.\n> \n> Walls: Border cells x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid goes from x=1 to x=6 and y=1 to y=6? No, x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x-coordinates from 1 to 6 are free, similarly y from 1 to 6. But there's an internal obstacle at (3,6), so that cell is blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions: Head at (5,3), then (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1). So the snake is 12 segments long. Head direction is D, meaning down, so last move was down to (5,3).

Let's see: current turn 44, so life span decreases each turn. So for food at (1,6), life span 3, on turn 44, it has 3 turns left, so it disappears after turn 46? I need to clarify.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So, at the start of turn, if life span is L, after the turn, it decreases by 1. When it reaches 0, it disappears before the next turn or after? Typically, it might be that at the beginning of turn t, if life span is 1, it can be eaten on that turn, then disappears.\n> \n> The rule: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" and \"disappears after N turns\".\n> \n> I think it's better to think: when food is spawned, it has a life span of N. At the end of each turn, life span decreases by 1. When life span reaches 0, the food disappears before the next turn starts.\n> \n> But for eating, if the head moves to a food cell during a turn, it is eaten.\n> \n> In this context, for turn 44, food at (1,6) has life span 3, meaning it can be eaten on turns 44, 45, 46, and disappears before turn 47.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,4) life span 6, can be eaten from turn 44 to 49, disappears before turn 50.\n> \n> (6,2) life span 9, eaten from 44 to 52, disappears before 53.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (5,3), direction down. Since last move was down, I cannot move up immediately because of no instant reverse. So possible moves are L (left to (4,3)? (5,3) to left is (4,3), but (4,3) is occupied by the snake body? Let's see snake positions: head (5,3), then (5,4), (6,4), etc. down to (4,1). Positions: [(5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1)]\n> \n> So (4,3) is part of the body, it's the 10th segment or something.

Walls: y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=1 to y=6 are free. y=2 is free, but is there wall? Border walls x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Also internal obstacle (3,6). (5,2) should be free, let's see if occupied.\n> \n> Snake positions: (5,3) head, (5,4), (6,4), etc., no (5,2), so empty? But we need to check if it's a wall or obstacle.\n> \n> Walls: border x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so (5,2) x=5 between 1-6, y=2 between 1-6, not border. Internal obstacles only (3,6), so (5,2) is free.\n> \n> But is it occupied by food?

Border x=0 and x=7, so x=1 to x=6 should be free, but x=7 is wall, so x=6 is not wall. Similarly y=3. Internal obstacle (3,6), not (6,3). Snake positions: no (6,3), so (6,3) should be free.\n> \n> Food: not listed, so empty cell.\n> \n> Also, direction: current head direction D (down), so moving R (right) is not reverse; reverse would be U (up), which is opposite to down.\n> \n> Possible moves without collision:\n> \n> - D: to (5,2) — free, as above.\n> \n> - R: to (6,3) — free.\n> \n> - L: to (4,3) — occupied by body, not tail, so invalid.\n> \n> - U: to (5,4) — occupied by body, not tail, invalid.\n> \n> So only possible moves are D or R.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score, prioritize survival.\n> \n> Food available:\n> \n> (1,6) - life span 3, so must be eaten by turn 46.\n> \n> (2,4) - life span 6, by turn 49.\n> \n> (6,2) - life span 9, by turn 52.\n> \n> Snake is at (5,3), head.\n> \n> Also, there is a special rule about tail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> First, where is the tail? Tail at (4,1). Head at (5,3), not adjacent. Adjacent cells to head (5,3): (5,2), (5,4), (4,3), (6,3). Tail is at (4,1), which is not adjacent; (4,1) is down-left or something, but not adjacent in the four directions. Adjacent means sharing an edge, so (4,1) is at distance, not adjacent to (5,3). So no issue now.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan a sequence of moves for several turns.\n> \n> First, let's sketch the grid.\n> \n> Grid from x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, with wall at (3,6) internal obstacle.\n> \n> y=6 is top?

Head direction is down (D), which means it was moving downward to (5,2) from the previous position. Since head is at (5,2) and direction is D, that means it came from (5,3) or something? Let's list the positions in order:\n> \n> - Head: (5,2)\n> \n> - Then (5,3) → so if head is at (5,2) and moving down, but (5,2) to (5,3) would be up?

So from (5,2), moving down would go to (5,1), but y=0 is wall, so (5,1) is within bounds? y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=0 is bottom?

Walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the playable area is x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? No, walls are at x=0 and x=7, so x=1 to x=6 are free, similarly y=1 to y=6? But y=0 and y=7 are walls, so cells with y=0 or y=7 are walls, similarly x=0 or x=7.\n> \n> In the border cells, it says x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7, so any cell with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 is a wall. So the snake can only be on cells with 1<=x<=6 and 1<=y<=6.\n> \n> Now, snake positions: head (5,2), which is x=5, y=2. y=2 is fine, not wall.\n> \n> Direction down (D) means moving in decreasing y?

Life span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 45, life span is 2, after turn 45 it becomes 1, after turn 46 it becomes 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten on turn 45 or 46.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,4) life span 5, so lasts until turn 49 (45 to 49: 5 turns? Let's calculate.\n> \n> Turn current: t=45, life span N, it disappears after N turns, meaning it will be gone at the start of turn t+N or something? The rule says: \"disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So at turn t, if life span is L, it decreases to L-1 at the end of turn t, and when it reaches 0, it disappears before the next turn or at the start? Typically, it might be that at the beginning of turn, if life span is 0, it is removed before actions.\n> \n> But for eating, we need to see if it's present when head moves onto it.\n> \n> To be safe, I think for food with life span L at turn t, it can be eaten on turns from t to t+L-1, and disappears at turn t+L.\n> \n> Example: at t=45, food (1,6) has life span 2, so it can be eaten on turn 45 or 46, and disappears at turn 47.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,4) life span 5, can be eaten from 45 to 49, disappears at 50.\n> \n> (6,2) life span 8, from 45 to 52.\n> \n> Now, snake positions: let's plot this to visualize.\n> \n> Grid: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, but y=1 bottom?

Since D decreases y, from (5,3) to (5,2) is down, decreasing y, so y=2 is below y=3, so y=1 is bottom, y=6 top.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,4) at y=4, then (6,4) at x=6,y=4, then (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2).\n> \n> (4,2) is tail.\n> \n> Now, head direction is D, so current movement is down.\n> \n> I need to choose actions for multiple turns ahead, at least 5 turns.\n> \n> First, possible moves from current position (5,2):\n> \n> Current head at (5,2), direction D, so I can move U, D, L, R, but no instant reverse.

Is (5,1) free? Walls: y=0 and y=7 walls, so y=1 is not wall. Snake positions: (5,1) not in positions, so it should be free, unless it's a wall or obstacle. Walls are only at borders and internal, internal obstacle at (3,6), so (5,1) should be free. But y=1 is not wall, since walls are y=0 and y=7, so y=1 is playable. Similarly, no snake body there except tail is at (4,2), not (5,1). So moving to (5,1) is safe.\n> \n> - L: left to (4,2). (4,2) is the current tail. Tail will move, so if I move to (4,2), and since I eat no food (no food at (4,2)? Food positions: (1,6), (2,4), (6,2). No food at (4,2), so if I move to (4,2), I don't eat, so tail moves away, and head occupies (4,2), but since tail was there, but after move, tail moves, so no collision. Specifically, when head moves to a cell, if it's food, eat and grow, else just move.\n> \n> If head moves to tail cell and no food, then head moves to that cell, and since tail moves forward, the cell is vacated, so no issue.\n> \n> If head moves to tail cell and there is food, but in this case, no food at (4,2), so safe.\n> \n> - R: right to (6,2). (6,2) has food, value 1, life span 8. So if I move R, I go to (6,2), eat the food, length increases by 1, so tail doesn't move, and a new segment is added at head position after eating.\n> \n> When you eat, the snake grows, so tail stays, and head moves to food cell, adding a segment.\n> \n> Sequence: head moves to new cell, if food, then eat, and snake grows by adding a segment at the new position, so the tail doesn't move that turn. If no food, tail moves, so the last segment is removed.\n> \n> In this case, if I move to (6,2), which has food, so I eat it, head is now at (6,2), and a new segment is added, so the snake body extends, tail remains where it was.\n> \n> Now, after eating, the new tail position depends on the previous state.\n> \n> But for collision, after moving, we need to check if head collides with body.\n> \n> Now, current positions: head at (5,2), body: (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2) tail.\n> \n> If I move R to (6,2), which is food, so I eat it. New head position (6,2), and since I ate, I add a segment, so the body becomes: old head (5,2) becomes new first body segment, then (5,3), (5,4), etc., and tail (4,2) stays because no movement of tail.\n> \n> Snake grows: when head moves to food cell, it stays there, and a new body segment is added at that position, but the tail doesn't move, so the snake increases in length.\n> \n> Positions: after move, head is at new position, and the previous head becomes the first body segment, and all body segments shift, but since tail doesn't move, the last segment remains.\n> \n> Standard snake: when no eat, head moves to new cell, tail moves away from last cell.\n> \n> When eat, head moves to new cell, tail stays, so new segment added.\n> \n> So positions: new head at (6,2), then the previous head (5,2) is now body, then (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), ..., up to (4,2) tail.

P[10] was (4,3), which is now the new tail.\n> \n> P[11] (4,2) is removed, but head moved there, so it's occupied by head now.\n> \n> New positions: [ (4,2)H, (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3)T ] so tail at (4,3).\n> \n> Safe.\n> \n> - R: to (6,2), with food, eat, so grow: new head at (6,2), body: (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2)T  (tail stays, length 13).\n> \n> Now, for long-term, I need to consider getting other food, especially (1,6) with short life span.\n> \n> From current position (5,2), (1,6) is at distance |5-1| + |2-6| = 4 + 4 = 8 moves away, but with life span 2, it must be eaten by turn 46, so in 2 turns including current, but since head at (5,2), it can't reach (1,6) in one or two moves. Minimum moves: from (5,2) to (1,6), need to go left 4, up 4, but not direct path, but at least 4 moves if no obstacles, but 4 moves in 2 turns? Turn 45 and 46, only 2 actions, can move at most 2 steps, so from (5,2), after 2 moves, I can be at most |dx|+|dy|=2 away, but (1,6) is dx=4, dy=4, so impossible to reach in 2 turns.

(4,2) and (4,3) are adjacent vertically. Head is at (4,2), tail at (4,3), so yes, adjacent.\n> \n> Now, is there food on the tail cell? Tail cell is (4,3).

(4,3) is in the positions, it's the tail segment. But when we move, the snake moves, so if I move to (4,3), since it's the tail, it might be okay because the tail will move away, but let's see the rules.\n> \n> Rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment).

So (4,1) should be empty and valid.\n> \n> - Right (R) to (5,2): but (5,2) is occupied by the body segment, which is not the tail. Positions: head at (4,2), then (5,2) is the next segment, so it's a body segment, not tail. Moving to (5,2) would cause head to collide with body, since it's not the tail. Tail is (4,3), so (5,2) is second segment? Let's see: positions: index 0: (4,2) head, index 1: (5,2), which is adjacent to head, but when moving, if head goes to (5,2), which is currently occupied, and since it's not the tail, it would collide. Rule: body collision if head touches any body segment except when it's the tail and tail moves.\n> \n> But (5,2) is not the tail; tail is at end, (4,3). So moving to (5,2) would cause collision, invalid.\n> \n> Also, cannot move opposite direction, but since current direction is L, moving R is opposite, so not allowed anyway.\n> \n> So possible moves: U, D, L.\n> \n> U: to (4,3) which is tail\n> \n> D: to (4,1) empty\n> \n> L: to (3,2) empty\n> \n> Now, need to think about food and survival.\n> \n> Food with short life: (1,6) has life span 1, so it will disappear after this turn if not eaten now. But it's at (1,6), which is far from head at (4,2). Distance: |4-1| + |2-6| = 3 + 4 = 7, so not reachable in one turn, so impossible to eat this turn. Therefore, (1,6) will disappear after this turn; we can ignore it.\n> \n> Life span 1, current turn, so after this turn, it disappears. Since head is not at (1,6), it won't be eaten, so yes, gone.\n> \n> Other food: (2,4) life 4, (6,2) life 7, (6,3) life 10.\n> \n> Now, head at (4,2), so (6,2) is at same y, x=6, so two steps right, but we can only move one step per turn.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,3) is at (6,3), adjacent to (6,2).\n> \n> (2,4) is at (2,4).\n> \n> Also, need to consider the snake body and possible paths.\n> \n> Since we need to think 5+ turns ahead, I should simulate possible moves.\n> \n> First, let's sketch the grid.\n> \n> Grid rows y=1 to 6, columns x=1 to 6.\n> \n> Walls: borders, so cells (x,0), (x,7), (0,y), (7,y) for all x,y, but since we can't go there, focus on 1-6.\n> \n> Internal wall at (3,6).\n> \n> Snake: head (4,2), body: (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3)\n> \n> So the snake is like: from (4,2) left to (5,2)? No: positions: head (4,2), then (5,2) is next, so from (4,2) to (5,2) is right, but head direction is L? Contradiction.\n> \n> Head direction is given as L, but position: from (4,2) to (5,2) is moving right? But direction is left? Inconsistency.\n> \n> Perhaps I misread the positions.\n> \n> Snake positions: [(4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3)]\n> \n> Head at (4,2), next segment (5,2). So the snake is moving from (4,2) to (5,2), which is +x, so right. But head direction is given as \"L\" for left? That can't be right.\n> \n> Current head direction is L, meaning it was moving left to reach (4,2)? But positions show it came from (5,2) to (4,2), which is left, so at turn 46, head is at (4,2), and it arrived from right, so direction is left, meaning it was moving left to get to (4,2).\n> \n> For the next move, from (4,2), with direction L, so it can move U, D, L, not R.\n> \n> But in terms of position, (5,2) is the segment behind the head.\n> \n> When we move, the head moves to a new cell, and the body follows.\n> \n> For move options, from (4,2), moving L to (3,2), U to (4,3), or D to (4,1).\n> \n> Now, (4,3) is the tail, which is safe to move to because the tail will move.\n> \n> (4,1) is empty.\n> \n> (3,2) is empty.\n> \n> Now, let's consider the food.\n> \n> (6,2) is at (6,2), which is currently occupied? No, food is at (6,2), but is it occupied by snake? Snake positions: (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), but not (6,2) or (6,3). (6,2) is food, not occupied. Similarly, (6,3) is food.\n> \n> But snake has segment at (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), so (6,2) and (6,3) are free for now.\n> \n> (2,4) is free.\n> \n> Now, life spans: (2,4) has life 4, so it will disappear after 4 turns, meaning on turn 50 it disappears (since current turn 46, after this turn life decreases, so at the end of turn 46, life decreases by 1, so for (2,4) life 4, after turn 46 it becomes 3, then after 47:2, 48:1, after 49 it becomes 0 and disappears, so must be eaten by turn 49 to get it.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,2) life 7, disappears after turn 52, etc.\n> \n> But we need to eat while avoiding risks.\n> \n> Also, the snake is quite long, 12 segments, so it takes space.\n> \n> Now, let's think about possible actions for turn 46.\n> \n> Option 1: Move L to (3,2)\n> \n> Then head at (3,2), body follows, tail moves, so the new positions: head (3,2), then (4,2), (5,2), ..., but (4,3) is tail, so when head moves to (3,2), the tail (4,3) might move or not? When snake moves, head goes to new cell, each segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead.\n> \n> So, new head position: (3,2) if move L.\n> \n> Then the segment that was at (4,2) moves to where? The body: the first body segment was at (5,2), it moves to (4,2), which was the old head position.\n> \n> Then (5,3) moves to (5,2), (5,4) to (5,3), (6,4) to (5,4), (6,5) to (6,4), (6,6) to (6,5), (5,6) to (6,6), (4,6) to (5,6), (4,5) to (4,6), (4,4) to (4,5), (4,3) to (4,4). And the tail was (4,3), which moves to (4,4), so (4,3) is now free, but since we moved, the cell (4,3) is vacated.\n> \n> Similarly, if move U to (4,3), which is the current tail position.\n> \n> If move U to (4,3), head moves to (4,3), which was tail, so no collision.

So the snake is 12 segments long.\n> \n> Snake head direction is Down, which is D. That means from (4,1), moving down would go to (4,0), but y=0 is a wall, so moving down is impossible because it would hit the bottom border.\n> \n> Current head position is (4,1), direction D. Moving D would be to (4,0), but y=0 is a wall, so that's a collision. Therefore, I cannot move down; I must choose another direction.\n> \n> Possible moves: U (up, to (4,2)), L (left, to (3,1)), or R (right, to (5,1)). Since the head is facing down, moving up would be a reverse, but the rule says \"no instant reverse\", meaning I cannot move opposite to the current direction on the next turn. Current direction is D, so opposite is U. Therefore, I cannot move up to (4,2) because that would be reversing direction instantly.\n> \n> Confirming the rule: \"Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\" Yes, so from direction D, I cannot move U immediately.\n> \n> Therefore, possible actions at turn 47 are L or R: left to (3,1) or right to (5,1).\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead and prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (2,4) with value 1, life span 4 (so it disappears after 4 turns, including current turn?

It's turn 48. The grid has walls at the borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. There's also an internal obstacle at (3,6). The snake positions are: head at (3,1), then (4,1), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5). That's 12 segments.

Life span decreases each turn, so I need to consider how many turns they have left.\n> \n> Current turn is 48, so:\n> \n> - (2,4) life span 3: disappears after turn 48 + 3 - 1? Let's clarify life span. It says \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So for food at turn t, it disappears at the end of turn t + life_span - 1? No.\n> \n> It says: \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So for example, if life span is N at turn t, it will be gone after N more turns, meaning it can be eaten on turns t to t + N - 1, and disappears at turn t + N.\n> \n> Standard interpretation: if life span is N, it starts at N, decreases by 1 each turn, and when it reaches 0, it disappears. But it says \"disappears after N turns\", so at turn t, with life span L, it will disappear after L turns, meaning at turn t + L.\n> \n> But the countdown decreases every turn including current, so at turn t, life span is L, then at turn t+1, it's L-1, and so on, until it reaches 0 at turn t + L - 1? Let's read carefully.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> I think it means: at the start, when spawned, life span is N. Each turn, including the turn it spawns, the countdown decreases by 1. When countdown reaches 0, it disappears after that turn. But \"disappears after N turns\" might be ambiguous.\n> \n> Perhaps \"after N turns\" means after N full turns from now. For example, if N=3 at turn t, it disappears at turn t+3.\n> \n> But countdown decreases every turn, including current, so at turn t, countdown = N, at turn t+1, countdown = N-1, ..., at turn t + N - 1, countdown =1, then after that turn, it disappears, so it can be eaten on turns t to t + N - 1.\n> \n> I think that's standard.\n> \n> In the state, food is given with life span at current turn, so for (2,4) at turn 48, life span 3, so it can be eaten on turns 48, 49, 50? Countdown: turn 48: 3, turn 49: 2, turn 50: 1, turn 51: disappears, so last chance to eat is turn 50.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,2) life span 5: turn 48:5, 49:4, 50:3, 51:2, 52:1, disappears after turn 52, so can be eaten up to turn 52.\n> \n> (6,3) life span 8: can be eaten up to turn 48+8-1=55? Turn 48:8, 49:7, ..., 55:1, disappears after turn 55.\n> \n> Now, snake head is at (3,1), direction L, so it just moved left to (3,1) from (4,1)? Positions: [(3,1), (4,1), ...] and head direction L, meaning it was at (4,1) before and moved left to (3,1).\n> \n> Since direction is L, and no instant reverse, I cannot move right (opposite) on the next turn. So from (3,1), possible moves are U, D, L.

The rules say food can spawn under the body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and then head moves there.\n> \n> Similarly, other foods: (2,4) is at turn 49 with life span 2, so it will disappear after turn 50 if not eaten? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 49, life span 2 means it will disappear after turn 50? Let me clarify.\n> \n> Life span: \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So for food at turn t with life span L, it will be present until turn t + L - 1? For example, at turn t, life span L, after this turn, it becomes L-1, and so on, until L=0, it disappears. So it can be eaten from turn t to turn t + L - 1.\n> \n> At turn t, with life span L, it can be eaten on that turn, and for the next L-1 turns, so it disappears after turn t + L.\n> \n> Standard: if life span is L at turn t, it exists for turns t, t+1, ..., t+L-1, and disappears at turn t+L.\n> \n> But the description says \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> Assume at turn t, food has life span L. After turn t, countdown becomes L-1. After turn t+1, L-2, ..., after turn t+L-1, countdown 0, so it disappears at the start of turn t+L or after turn t+L-1? I think it's better to think that it can be eaten during turns when countdown >0.\n> \n> For (2,4): at turn 49, life span 2, so it can be eaten on turn 49 or turn 50. After turn 50, it disappears (since after turn 50, countdown would be 0).\n> \n> Similarly, (6,2): life span 4 at turn 49, so can be eaten on turns 49,50,51,52.\n> \n> (6,3): life span 7, turns 49 to 55.\n> \n> (5,3): life span 10, turns 49 to 58.\n> \n> But (5,3) is currently occupied by the snake body, so it can't be eaten now. Only if the snake moves away and then back.\n> \n> Now, snake head is at (3,2), direction Up. Possible moves: Up, Down, Left, Right, but with no instant reverse.\n> \n> Current direction is Up, so cannot move Down (opposite). So possible moves: Up, Left, Right.\n> \n> Moving Up: to (3,3)\n> \n> Moving Left: to (2,2)\n> \n> Moving Right: to (4,2)\n> \n> But (4,2) is occupied by the snake body? Snake positions: head (3,2), then (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), etc. So (4,2) is the fourth segment. Since the snake moves, when the head moves, the tail moves, so (4,2) might not be occupied after the move, but we need to simulate.\n> \n> In terms of collision, when moving to a cell, if that cell is occupied by any body segment except the tail, it's a collision. But if it's the tail, it might be ok because the tail moves.\n> \n> General rule: after moving, if head is in a cell with any body segment except that the tail might be leaving that cell, so it's safe only if moving into the tail cell.\n> \n> Specifically: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, when considering a move, the head can move to the tail's current position only if the tail is moving away, which it will if the snake moves forward.\n> \n> In this case, current tail is at (4,6). But let's list all occupied cells after movement.\n> \n> First, for immediate move at turn 49.\n> \n> Head at (3,2). Possible moves:\n> \n> - Up: to (3,3)\n> \n> - Left: to (2,2)\n> \n> - Right: to (4,2)\n> \n> Now, check if these cells are free or occupied.\n> \n> Current snake positions: [(3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6)]\n> \n> After any move, the head moves to new position, and each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead. So the tail (4,6) will be removed, and a new segment added at head position if food is eaten, but for now, no food, so length same.\n> \n> So after move:\n> \n> - If head moves to (3,3), new positions: head (3,3), then body: (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6) — tail is (5,6) now? Let's see:\n> \n> Original: positions index 0: head (3,2), 1: (3,1), 2: (4,1), 3: (4,2), 4: (5,2), 5: (5,3), 6: (5,4), 7: (6,4), 8: (6,5), 9: (6,6), 10: (5,6), 11: (4,6) tail.\n> \n> After move head to (3,3), new head at (3,3), then segment 1 moves to where head was (3,2), segment 2 to (3,1), segment 3 to (4,1), segment 4 to (4,2), segment 5 to (5,2), segment 6 to (5,3), segment 7 to (5,4), segment 8 to (6,4), segment 9 to (6,5), segment 10 to (6,6), segment 11 to (5,6). Then tail is segment 11 at (5,6), and segment 10 was (6,6) to (5,6), but (4,6) is no longer part of snake; it was tail and removed.\n> \n> New positions: head (3,3), then (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6) — so tail at (5,6).\n> \n> Now, for (3,3): is it occupied? In current state, (3,3) is not in snake positions, so it's free. No wall there, walls are borders and (3,6).\n> \n> (3,6) is an obstacle, but (3,3) is fine.\n> \n> Similarly, move Left to (2,2): (2,2) not in snake positions, not wall, so free.\n> \n> Move Right to (4,2): but (4,2) is currently occupied by segment 3. After move, if head goes to (4,2), but in the new positions, when head moves to (4,2), the body segments move, so segment 1 to (3,2), segment 2 to (3,1), segment 3 to (4,1), segment 4 to (5,2)? Let's simulate:\n> \n> Head to (4,2). New head (4,2). Then segment 1 moves to old head (3,2), segment 2 to old seg1 (3,1), segment 3 to old seg2 (4,1), segment 4 to old seg3 (4,2) — but old seg3 is (4,2), which is where head is going? Conflict.\n> \n> When head moves to a new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment before it.\n> \n> So positions: after head move to (4,2), the new position 0: (4,2) head.\n> \n> Position 1: previous position 0, which was (3,2)\n> \n> Position 2: previous position 1, which was (3,1)\n> \n> Position 3: previous position 2, which was (4,1)\n> \n> Position 4: previous position 3, which was (4,2) — but (4,2) is now the head, so position 4 would be (4,2), but that's the same as head, collision.\n> \n> In terms of the list: the cell (4,2) was occupied by segment 3 before move. After move, head moves to (4,2), and segment 3 moves to where? Segment 3 was at (4,2), but head is moving there, so when segment 3 moves to its new position, it goes to where segment 2 was, which is (4,1).\n> \n> Let's index properly.\n> \n> Let S_t be positions at time t before move.\n> \n> S_t: [H = (3,2), B1=(3,1), B2=(4,1), B3=(4,2), B4=(5,2), B5=(5,3), B6=(5,4), B7=(6,4), B8=(6,5), B9=(6,6), B10=(5,6), B11=(4,6)]\n> \n> After move, head moves to new position, say P.\n> \n> Then new positions: [H_new = P, B1_new = H, B2_new = B1, B3_new = B2, ..., B11_new = B10]\n> \n> The tail B11 is removed.\n> \n> For P = (4,2)\n> \n> Then H_new = (4,2)\n> \n> B1_new = H = (3,2)\n> \n> B2_new = B1 = (3,1)\n> \n> B3_new = B2 = (4,1)\n> \n> B4_new = B3 = (4,2) — B3 was (4,2), so B4_new = (4,2)\n> \n> But H_new is also (4,2), so now head and B4 are both at (4,2), collision.\n> \n> Therefore, moving to (4,2) is invalid because it causes collision with body segment.\n> \n> Similarly, if head moves to a cell that is occupied by a body segment that is not the tail, and that segment will not move away, it causes collision.\n> \n> In this case, (4,2) is occupied by B3, which is not the tail, and after move, B3 moves to (4,1), but B4 moves to (4,2), so the cell (4,2) has B4 and head at same time? No: the new positions are assigned sequentially.\n> \n> The cell (4,2) is occupied by B3 at time t. At time t+1, after move, H_new is at (4,2), and B4_new is at B3's old position (4,2), so yes, two segments at same cell, which is collision.\n> \n> But the tail: if head moves to the tail's position, since tail moves away, it might be ok.\n> \n> For example, if head moves to the current tail position, say (4,6).\n> \n> But (4,6) is not adjacent to head; head is at (3,2), tail at (4,6), not adjacent.\n> \n> In this case for (4,2), it's not tail, so moving there causes collision.\n> \n> Therefore, for turn 49, moving Right to (4,2) is invalid, collision.\n> \n> Similarly, moving Up to (3,3): (3,3) is free, no issue.\n> \n> Moving Left to (2,2): (2,2) is free, no issue.\n> \n> Moving Down: but cannot, because opposite direction, current direction Up, so Down is invalid.\n> \n> So possible actions: Up or Left.\n> \n> Now, need to think ahead multiple turns to maximize score and survival.\n> \n> First, list all food and their expiration:\n> \n> - Food A: (2,4), value +1, life span 2 at t=49, so can be eaten on t=49 or t=50.

Then at t=51, I can move Up to (2,4), but t=51 is after t=50, and food disappears after t=50, so on t=51 it's gone. Life span: at t=49, life span 2, so exists t=49 and t=50, disappears at t=51.

It's turn 50, and I'm playing Snake on a grid with walls and food. The grid size isn't specified, but from the walls, it seems like it's 8x8 because borders are x=0/x=7 and y=0/y=7, so coordinates from (0,0) to (7,7).\n> \n> Walls:\n> - Border cells: all cells where x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7. So the grid is enclosed.\n> - Internal obstacle: one at (3,6).\n> \n> Snake positions: The snake is a list of segments, head first. So head is at (2,2), then (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6). That's 12 segments, so the snake is 12 units long.\n> \n> Head direction is L, which is left. So the snake is currently moving left.\n> \n> Food items:\n> - (2,4) with value 1, life span 1\n> - (6,2) with value 1, life span 3\n> - (6,3) with value 1, life span 6\n> - (5,3) with value 1, life span 9\n> \n> All food has value 1, so positive food, but I need to be careful about the tail reward danger.\n> \n> Life span: for (2,4), life span 1, meaning it will disappear after this turn if not eaten? Life span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 50, life span is 1, so after turn 50, it will be gone. I need to eat it on turn 50 or it disappears.\n> \n> Life span N: disappears after N turns. Countdown decreases every turn, including current.\n> \n> For food at (2,4): life span 1 at turn 50. That means it will disappear after turn 50, so it can be eaten on turn 50 only. If not eaten on turn 50, it's gone.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,2) life span 3: it will disappear after 3 turns, so after turn 52? Let's clarify.\n> \n> If life span is N at turn t, it decreases by 1 each turn. So at turn t, life span N; turn t+1, N-1; ... turn t + (N-1), life span 1; after turn t + N, it disappears. So it can be eaten from turn t to turn t + (N-1), inclusive? At turn t + k, for k from 0 to N-1, life span is N - k. When life span reaches 0, it disappears before the next turn.\n> \n> The rule says: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> I think it's better to think: at the start of turn t, food has life span L. If eaten during turn t, it's consumed. Then, after the move, life span decreases for all food. Or something. But for decision, I need to know when it can be eaten.\n> \n> For (2,4) at turn 50: life span 1. That means it can be eaten on turn 50.

So from (2,2), moving left would go to (1,2). But I need to check if that's possible.\n> \n> First, possible moves from (2,2) with current direction L.\n> \n> Since head direction is L, I can move U, D, L, but not R because that would be instant reverse?

It's turn 50, and I'm playing Snake on a grid with walls and food. The grid size isn't specified, but from the walls, it seems like it's 8x8 because borders are x=0/x=7 and y=0/y=7, so coordinates from (0,0) to (7,7).\n> \n> Walls:\n> - Border cells: all cells where x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7. So the grid is enclosed.\n> - Internal obstacle: one at (3,6).\n> \n> Snake positions: The snake is a list of segments, head first. So head is at (2,2), then (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6). That's 12 segments, so the snake is 12 units long.\n> \n> Head direction is L, which is left. So the snake is currently moving left.\n> \n> Food items:\n> - (2,4) with value 1, life span 1\n> - (6,2) with value 1, life span 3\n> - (6,3) with value 1, life span 6\n> - (5,3) with value 1, life span 9\n> \n> All food has value 1, so positive food, but I need to be careful about the tail reward danger.\n> \n> Life span: for (2,4), life span 1, meaning it will disappear after this turn if not eaten? Life span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 50, life span is 1, so after turn 50, it will be gone. I need to eat it on turn 50 or it disappears.\n> \n> Life span N: disappears after N turns. Countdown decreases every turn, including current.\n> \n> For food at (2,4): life span 1 at turn 50. That means it will disappear after turn 50, so it can be eaten on turn 50 only. If not eaten on turn 50, it's gone.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,2) life span 3: it will disappear after 3 turns, so after turn 52? Let's clarify.\n> \n> If life span is N at turn t, it decreases by 1 each turn. So at turn t, life span N; turn t+1, N-1; ... turn t + (N-1), life span 1; after turn t + N, it disappears. So it can be eaten from turn t to turn t + (N-1), inclusive? At turn t + k, for k from 0 to N-1, life span is N - k. When life span reaches 0, it disappears before the next turn.\n> \n> The rule says: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> I think it's better to think: at the start of turn t, food has life span L. If eaten during turn t, it's consumed. Then, after the move, life span decreases for all food. Or something. But for decision, I need to know when it can be eaten.\n> \n> For (2,4) at turn 50: life span 1. That means it can be eaten on turn 50.

So from (2,2), moving left would go to (1,2). But I need to check if that's possible.\n> \n> First, possible moves from (2,2) with current direction L.\n> \n> Since head direction is L, I can move U, D, L, but not R because that would be instant reverse?

But if it's the tail, it's ok because the tail moves away.\n> \n> In this case, the tail is at (5,6). So if head moves to a cell that is not tail and not empty, collision.\n> \n> For move to (1,2): is (1,2) in snake positions?

It will disappear after this turn.\n> \n> (2,4) life span 1 at turn 50, so if not eaten on turn 50, it disappears. Since I can't reach it in one move, I must miss it. So it will be gone.\n> \n> Similarly, other food.\n> \n> Now, let's list all food:\n> \n> - (2,4): value 1, life span 1, disappears after turn 50\n> \n> - (6,2): value 1, life span 3, can be eaten turn 50,51,52\n> \n> - (6,3): value 1, life span 6, turns 50-55\n> \n> - (5,3): value 1, life span 9, turns 50-58\n> \n> (5,3) is also a food, but (5,3) is currently occupied by the snake? Snake positions include (5,3), which is the 7th segment? Let's count: positions: 0:head (2,2), 1:(3,2), 2:(3,1), 3:(4,1), 4:(4,2), 5:(5,2), 6:(5,3), 7:(5,4), etc.\n> \n> So (5,3) is occupied by the snake body, segment index 6.\n> \n> Food at (5,3) is under the snake body.\n> \n> But according to rules, food can spawn under body, but can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves onto it.\n> \n> So for (5,3), since it's occupied by body, I need to move the snake so that the body moves away, then head moves to it.\n> \n> Currently, head is at (2,2), far away.\n> \n> Also, tail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it causes collision.\n> \n> Tail is at (5,6).

None at (5,6), so no issue now.\n> \n> But if I go near tail and eat food there, it might be dangerous.\n> \n> Now, back to action for turn 50.\n> \n> Possible moves: U, D, L from (2,2) with dir L.\n> \n> L to (1,2)\n> \n> U to (2,3)\n> \n> D to (2,1)\n> \n> I need to think ahead to maximize score and survive.\n> \n> Food at (2,4) is expiring, but I can't reach it, so ignore.\n> \n> Other food: (6,2), (6,3), (5,3)\n> \n> (6,2) and (6,3) are near the tail area, but tail is at (5,6), so not directly adjacent.\n> \n> Snake is long, 12 segments.\n> \n> The grid is 8x8, walls on borders, obstacle at (3,6).\n> \n> I should map the grid.\n> \n> Let me sketch a grid:\n> \n> Rows y=0 to 7, bottom to top? Usually in coordinates, y=0 might be bottom or top?

Movement U is (x,y+1), so if y+1, it might be increasing upwards. But in the state, walls y=0 and y=7, so y=0 is bottom or top?

Wait, the format says \"Value and Life Span\", but for (5,3) it says \"7,1\" – I think it's (x,y), life_span, value. So for (6,2): life_span=2, value=1; (6,3): life_span=4, value=1; (5,3): life_span=7, value=1; (1,5): life_span=10, value=1.

Similar to before, old tail (6,5) removed, so new tail at (5,4) or (6,4)? Old index 10 (6,4) moves to old index 9 position (5,4), so new positions: head (3,4), then (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4) — 11 segments, tail at (5,4).\n> \n> Head at (3,4), which is not adjacent to (6,2).\n> \n> From (3,4), on turn 53, I can move to (3,5), (3,3), (2,4), (4,4)\n> \n> (3,3) is body, occupied, so not possible.\n> \n> (2,4) might be free, (3,5), (4,4) free.\n> \n> But (6,2) is far away.\n> \n> So it seems impossible to reach (6,2) by turn 53, because from current position (3,3), I can only move to (3,4) or (4,3), both of which are at least 2 moves away from (6,2), and with only one move left to turn 53, I can't get there.\n> \n> Minimum distance to (6,2): from (3,3) to (6,2) is |3-6| + |3-2| = 3+1=4, so at least 4 moves, but I have only one move to turn 52, then on turn 53 I need to be at (6,2), so I need to be at an adjacent cell on turn 52 after move, but from (3,3), I can't reach an adjacent cell of (6,2) in one move.\n> \n> Therefore, it is impossible to eat the food at (6,2) before it disappears. It will expire after turn 53.\n> \n> So I should not try to go for it, as it's too risky and impossible.\n> \n> Life span 2 at turn 52, so after turn 52, if not eaten, life span 1, after turn 53, gone. But to eat on turn 52 or 53, but turn 52 not possible, turn 53 not possible, so yes, cannot eat it.

L to (3,3) occupied. R to (5,3) occupied.

No, only if food eaten.\n> \n> Moving to tail cell without food: head moves to (5,4), which was tail, then the tail segment is removed or what?\n> \n> When head moves to a cell, if it's not food, the tail is removed.\n> \n> If head moves to a cell occupied by tail, and no food, then the tail moves away, so the head takes that position, and the tail is cut off, so snake length decreases? No.\n> \n> Standard: when head moves to a new cell, if not food, the tail is removed, so snake length same.\n> \n> If head moves to a cell that was tail, it's ok because the tail moves to the previous position, so the cell is vacated.\n> \n> For example, head at (4,4), tail at (5,4).\n> \n> If head moves to (5,4), which is tail position, then new head at (5,4), and the tail was at (5,4), but it moves to the position of the segment before it, which is (5,3) in this case.\n> \n> Positions: before move, head (4,4), tail (5,4), and segment before tail is (5,3), say.\n> \n> After head moves to (5,4), new head (5,4), then the body segments shift, so the segment that was at (5,3) moves to where?

Invalid move.\n\n2. **Up (U) to (4,4)**:\n   - (4,4) is free (no walls or body segments).\n   - No food here.\n   - **Result**: Safe move. Snake moves without growing.\n\n3. **Down (D) to (4,2)**:\n   - (4,2) is occupied by the snake's body (segment 7, not the tail).\n   - Similar to moving right, this would cause a collision.\n   - **Result**: Deadly collision.

No, in snake, when moving, the head moves first, but if it moves to a cell with body, it collides, except for the tail if it moves away.\n> \n> General rule: collision if head moves to a cell occupied by any body segment except the tail, because tail will move.\n> \n> In this case, (5,3) is occupied by segment 9, which is not the tail; tail is (6,4). So if I move to (5,3), it's occupied by body, so I would collide and die.\n> \n> But the rule about food under body: it says the body must move away first.\n> \n> Perhaps the sequence is: when you decide to move, the body segments shift before the head moves? No, typically, the head moves to a new cell, then each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment in front.\n> \n> So for head to move to (5,3), which is currently occupied by segment 9. Since it's not the tail, and the tail is elsewhere, moving head to (5,3) would cause a collision because it's hitting the body.\n> \n> But the food rule says that food under body can be eaten only if the body moves away and head moves on.\n> \n> I think there's a timing issue.\n> \n> Let me interpret the rule carefully.\n> \n> \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if:\n> 1. The body moves away, and\n> 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> So, for the food to be eaten, two conditions must be satisfied: the body must no longer be on that cell when the head moves there.\n> \n> In terms of movement sequence: at the beginning of the turn, the body is on the cell. When the snake moves, the body segments shift to the previous positions, so the cell is vacated, then the head moves to the new cell.\n> \n> If that new cell has food, and it was vacated, then it can be eaten.\n> \n> In this case, for (5,3): before move, body is there. When snake moves, segment 9 will move to where segment 8 was, which is (5,2), so (5,3) is vacated. Then head moves to (5,3), which is now empty and has food, so I can eat it, no collision.\n> \n> Similarly, for the tail, if head moves to tail position, but tail moves away, so it's safe.\n> \n> But in this case, (5,3) is not the tail; it's a body segment.\n> \n> In the shifting, when the head moves, all body segments shift down, so the cell that was occupied by a body segment is vacated if it's not the new position.\n> \n> Specifically, for cell (5,3), it was occupied by segment 9. After shift, segment 9 moves to (5,2), so (5,3) is free. Then head moves to (5,3), so no problem.\n> \n> And since food is there, I eat it.\n> \n> But is there a collision? Only if the head moves to a cell that is occupied after the shift or something.\n> \n> Standard snake: the head moves to a new cell; if that cell is not free (e.g., wall, body, etc.), it dies. But for body, if the cell is occupied by a body segment that is not the tail, or if it is the tail but the tail moves away, it's ok only if eating food or something.\n> \n> I think I need to clarify with the rules given.\n> \n> From the core rules:\n> \n> \"**Deadly Collisions**\n> - Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, moving to a body segment cell is deadly unless it's the tail segment, and the tail will move forward, so it's safe.\n> \n> In this case, (5,3) is a body segment, not the tail, so if I move to (5,3), it should be a collision and I die.\n> \n> But the food rule says that for food under body, it can be eaten if the body moves away and head moves on, implying that it is possible without collision.\n> \n> Perhaps for cells that are vacated by the body move, it's not considered occupied when the head moves there.\n> \n> To resolve this, let's think logically.\n> \n> At the start of turn, positions are fixed.\n> \n> When you choose a move, the head attempts to move to the new cell.\n> \n> If that cell is occupied by a body segment, it collides unless it is the tail segment.\n> \n> For the tail segment, if head moves there, and the tail moves away, it's ok, and if food is there, it can be eaten.\n> \n> For other body segments, if head moves there, it collides because that segment doesn't move away; it stays or moves to another position, but the cell is occupied at the time of move.\n> \n> In this case, for (5,3), it is occupied by segment 9, which is not the tail. If head moves to (5,3), since it's not the tail, and the cell is occupied, it should be a collision.\n> \n> But the food rule suggests that if the body moves away, it can be eaten, so for that to happen, the body must be moving away, meaning that in the movement sequence, the body vacates the cell before the head moves there.\n> \n> I think there's ambiguity.\n> \n> Perhaps in this game, the movement is simultaneous: all segments move at once, so when the head moves to (5,3), the body segment that was there moves to (5,2), so the cell is free at the moment the head moves, so no collision.\n> \n> I think that's the intended behavior, especially with the food rule.\n> \n> Moreover, in the \"Tail Reward Danger\" it specifies for the tail case.\n> \n> So for non-tail body segments, if the head moves to a cell that was occupied by a body segment, but that segment moves away, it should be safe, and if food is there, it can be eaten.\n> \n> Similarly for this case.\n> \n> So for (5,3), if I move head to (5,3), the body at (5,3) moves to (5,2), vacating it, so head can move to (5,3) safely and eat the food.\n> \n> But let's confirm with the positions.\n> \n> Before move:\n> - (5,3) occupied by segment 9\n> \n> After move (head to (5,3)):\n> - Head moves to (5,3)\n> - Segment 9 (which was at (5,3)) moves to where segment 8 was, which is (5,2)\n> - Segment 8 was at (5,2), moves to where segment 7 was, (4,2)\n> - And so on, down to tail.\n> \n> Since segment 9 moves to (5,2), (5,3) is free when head moves there, so no collision, and food can be eaten.\n> \n> Similarly, if I move to a cell that is the tail, it might be different, but here it's not.\n> \n> So for (5,3), moving right should be safe and I can eat the food.\n> \n> But let's also check if it's the tail.

After move, positions: head to (4,4), then segment 1 to (4,3), segment 2 to (3,3), and so on, segment 11 (was (6,4)) moves to (5,4)? Positions:\n> \n> Before move: indices 0:(4,3), 1:(3,3), 2:(2,3), 3:(2,2), 4:(3,2), 5:(3,1), 6:(4,1), 7:(4,2), 8:(5,2), 9:(5,3), 10:(5,4), 11:(6,4)\n> \n> After move U to (4,4):\n> - New head: (4,4)\n> - Segment 1 (old head) to (4,3) -> but (4,3) is now the new position for segment 1\n> - Segment 1 was at (3,3), now moves to where old segment 0 was, (4,3)\n> - Segment 2 was at (2,3), moves to where old segment 1 was, (3,3)\n> - ...\n> - Segment 10 was at (5,4), moves to where old segment 9 was, (5,3)\n> - Segment 11 was at (6,4), moves to where old segment 10 was, (5,4)\n> \n> So tail is now at (5,4), and (6,4) is free.\n> \n> No food eaten, so length same.\n> \n> - D to (4,2): (4,2) has no food, but is occupied by segment 7. If move to (4,2), as before, segment 7 moves to (4,1), so (4,2) vacated, head moves there, no collision, no food, so tail moves: segment 11 moves to (5,4)? After move: head to (4,2), segment 1 to (4,3), segment 2 to (3,3), ..., segment 7 was at (4,2) but moves to where? Segment 7 moves to where old segment 6 was, (4,1)\n> \n> Segment 8 moves to where old segment 7 was, but old segment 7 was at (4,2), which is now head, so segment 8 moves to (4,2)? No.\n> \n> Standard: after head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment before it.\n> \n> So for segment i, it moves to the position that segment i-1 was at before the move.\n> \n> Before move, positions:\n> - 0: (4,3)\n> - 1: (3,3)\n> - 2: (2,3)\n> - 3: (2,2)\n> - 4: (3,2)\n> - 5: (3,1)\n> - 6: (4,1)\n> - 7: (4,2)\n> - 8: (5,2)\n> - 9: (5,3)\n> - 10: (5,4)\n> - 11: (6,4)\n> \n> After move D to (4,2):\n> - New head: (4,2)\n> - Segment 1 moves to position of old segment 0: (4,3)\n> - Segment 2 moves to position of old segment 1: (3,3)\n> - Segment 3 moves to position of old segment 2: (2,3)\n> - Segment 4 moves to position of old segment 3: (2,2)\n> - Segment 5 moves to position of old segment 4: (3,2)\n> - Segment 6 moves to position of old segment 5: (3,1)\n> - Segment 7 moves to position of old segment 6: (4,1)\n> - Segment 8 moves to position of old segment 7: (4,2) but (4,2) is the new head position?

But new head is at (4,2), so collision? No.\n> \n> New segment 8 is at old position of segment 7, which was (4,2), but new head is also at (4,2), so both head and segment 8 are at (4,2), collision.\n> \n> I think I confused.\n> \n> After moving the head, the new positions are:\n> \n> - Head at new cell: (4,2)\n> \n> Then, for the body, new position of segment 1 is the old position of segment 0, which is (4,3)\n> \n> New position of segment 2 is old position of segment 1, (3,3)\n> \n> New position of segment 3 is old position of segment 2, (2,3)\n> \n> New position of segment 4 is old position of segment 3, (2,2)\n> \n> New position of segment 5 is old position of segment 4, (3,2)\n> \n> New position of segment 6 is old position of segment 5, (3,1)\n> \n> New position of segment 7 is old position of segment 6, (4,1)\n> \n> New position of segment 8 is old position of segment 7, (4,2)\n> \n> But new head is at (4,2), and new segment 8 is also at (4,2), so the cell (4,2) has both head and body, collision.\n> \n> Why? Because when moving down to (4,2), which was occupied by segment 7, but after the move, segment 7 moves to (4,1), so (4,2) should be free for the head? I think I have a mistake in the indexing.\n> \n> Let's think differently.\n> \n> When the snake moves, the head moves to a new cell. If that cell is free or has food, it moves there. If it has food, it eats and grows; if not, the tail is removed.\n> \n> For body collision: if the new head position is the same as the position of any body segment after the move, except the tail if it moves, but in this case, for a body segment, after the move, it is at a different position.\n> \n> In the move to (4,2):\n> \n> - Before move, (4,2) is occupied by segment 7.\n> \n> - Head moves to (4,2). At this point, (4,2) is occupied, so collision should occur because it's not the tail.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So for a body segment that is not the tail, if head moves to its cell, it is a collision because that segment doesn't move away fast enough.\n> \n> In this case, for (4,2), it is occupied by segment 7, not tail, so moving to (4,2) should cause collision and death.\n> \n> Similarly, for (5,3), if I move right, (5,3) is occupied by segment 9, not tail, so moving to it should cause collision.\n> \n> But for the food rule, it says the body must move away, which suggests that it is possible.\n> \n> I think there's a conflict.\n> \n> Perhaps the movement is such that the body segments move first, vacating their cells, then the head moves.\n> \n> But in standard snake, it's simultaneous or head first.\n> \n> To avoid confusion, let's assume that for non-tail body segments, moving to their cell is deadly, as per the collision rule.\n> \n> For food under body, it can only be eaten if the body moves away, meaning that in a future turn when that body segment is no longer there or has moved, then head can move to it.\n> \n> For example, for (5,3), if I don't move there now, but later when the body has moved, I can eat it.\n> \n> Similarly, in this case, for turn 53, moving to (5,3) or (4,2) would cause collision because they are occupied by body segments not tail.\n> \n> So from (4,3), possible moves:\n> \n> - R to (5,3): (5,3) occupied by segment 9, not tail, so collision, die.\n> \n> - D to (4,2): (4,2) occupied by segment 7, not tail, so collision, die.\n> \n> - U to (4,4): (4,4) is free, no body, so safe to move there.\n> \n> Also, L to (3,3) is not allowed because it's opposite direction, current direction R, so cannot move L.\n> \n> So only possible move is U to (4,4), to avoid collision.\n> \n> Is that right?\n> \n> (4,4) is free?

They are adjacent, but tail cell (5,4) has no food, so no danger.\n- Moving R to (5,4) is safe.\n\n### Immediate Action:\nThe best immediate move is **Right (R)** to (5,4) to start the path toward eating (6,3).\n\n\\boxed{R}",

It's turn 54. The grid has walls: border cells at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and an internal obstacle at (3,6). So, the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), but with walls on the borders and that one obstacle.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (4,4), then body segments: (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4). Let me list them in order:\n> \n> - Head: (4,4)\n> \n> - Segment 1: (4,3)\n> \n> - Segment 2: (3,3)\n> \n> - Segment 3: (2,3)\n> \n> - Segment 4: (2,2)\n> \n> - Segment 5: (3,2)\n> \n> - Segment 6: (3,1)\n> \n> - Segment 7: (4,1)\n> \n> - Segment 8: (4,2)\n> \n> - Segment 9: (5,2)\n> \n> - Segment 10: (5,3)\n> \n> - Segment 11: (5,4)\n> \n> That's 12 segments? Positions list has 12 elements: [(4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4)]. So snake length is 12.\n> \n> Head direction is U, which is up. So currently moving upwards.\n> \n> Food:\n> \n> - (6,3) with life span 3, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (5,3) with life span 5, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (1,5) with life span 8, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> All food is positive, no negative food mentioned.\n> \n> Life span decreases every turn, including current, so for (6,3), life span 3 means it disappears after 3 turns from now? Life span is given, and it decreases each turn, so at turn 54, life span 3 means it will disappear after turn 56? Let's clarify.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So at turn t, if life span is L, it decreases to L-1 at turn t+1, and when it reaches 0, it disappears. So if life span is L at turn t, it will be gone after turn t + L - 1? No.\n> \n> Example: at turn t, life span L. After turn t, it decreases to L-1. So it exists for L more turns? Let's think.\n> \n> If at turn t, life span is L, then:\n> \n> - At turn t: life span L\n> \n> - Turn t+1: life span L-1\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - Turn t + L - 1: life span 1\n> \n> - Turn t + L: life span 0, disappears before turn t+L+1? But since countdown decreases every turn including current, and disappears after N turns, meaning after N turns from now it's gone.\n> \n> The rule: \"Disappears after N turns\" and N is life_span at current turn.\n> \n> So for food at (6,3): life span 3 at turn 54, so it will disappear after 3 turns, meaning after turn 56? Turn 54: present, turn 55: present with life span 2, turn 56: present with life span 1, turn 57: gone? \"Disappears after N turns\" – after N turns from now.\n> \n> I think it means that it will not be present on turn t + N. So at turn t, life span N, it exists for turns t, t+1, ..., t+N-1, and disappears at turn t+N.\n> \n> Similarly here: at turn 54, life span 3 for (6,3), so it exists on turns 54, 55, 56, and disappears on turn 57.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,3) life span 5 at turn 54, exists until turn 58 (turns 54 to 58 inclusive? Turn 54: life span 5, turn 55:4, ..., turn 58: life span 1, turn 59: gone? After 5 turns from turn 54, so after turn 59 it is gone? Let's define:\n> \n> If at turn t, life span N, then:\n> \n> - Turn t: life span N\n> \n> - Turn t+1: life span N-1\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - Turn t + (N-1): life span 1\n> \n> - Turn t + N: life span 0, disappears, so not present.\n> \n> So for (6,3): life span 3 at turn 54, so present on turns 54,55,56, gone on turn 57.\n> \n> For (5,3): life span 5, present on turns 54,55,56,57,58, gone on turn 59.\n> \n> For (1,5): life span 8, present on turns 54 to 61, gone on turn 62.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (4,4), direction U. Possible moves: U, D, L, R, but cannot reverse instantly. Since direction is U, reverse is D, so cannot move D immediately. So possible moves: U, L, R.\n> \n> Now, adjacent cells:\n> \n> - U: (4,5) – up\n> \n> - D: (4,3) – but (4,3) is occupied by the body, segment 1, and it's not the tail. Tail is at (5,4)? Positions: head (4,4), then (4,3), (3,3), ..., (5,4) is the last, so tail is (5,4).\n> \n> Moving to (4,3) would be body collision, since (4,3) is a body segment and not the tail. Only tail is safe to move into if it moves away.\n> \n> Rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, for a cell occupied by a body segment:\n> \n> - If it's the tail, and tail moves away, it's safe.\n> \n> - Otherwise, collision and death.\n> \n> In this case, (4,3) is the first segment after head, so not tail. Tail is (5,4).\n> \n> Also, walls: borders, so x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Internal obstacle (3,6).\n> \n> Now, let's list possible moves from (4,4):\n> \n> - U: to (4,5). Is this safe? Check if wall or body.\n> \n> (4,5): x=4, y=5. Not on border walls since x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7, so (4,5) is within, not wall. Internal obstacles: (3,6), not (4,5). Body positions: snake positions are all listed, (4,5) not in the list, so empty. So (4,5) is free and safe to move to.\n> \n> - L: to (3,4). (3,4): not wall, not body? Positions: (4,4) head, (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), etc. (3,4) not in list, so free. Also not wall or obstacle. Obstacle is (3,6), not (3,4). So (3,4) free.\n> \n> - R: to (5,4). (5,4): not wall? x=5, y=4, within grid. But (5,4) is the tail of the snake. Positions: (5,4) is the last segment, tail. So moving to (5,4) is moving to tail cell. Since tail will move, it might be safe if we eat food or not? We only eat food if we move head to a food cell. (5,4) has food? Food positions: (6,3), (5,3), (1,5). (5,3) is food, but (5,4) is not food. (5,4) is the tail position, not food.\n> \n> So moving to (5,4) is moving to the tail cell. Since it's the tail, and if we don't eat food there, the tail will move, so it should be safe. But is there food at (5,4)? No, food is at (5,3), which is different. (5,3) is a body segment? Positions: (5,3) is segment 10 or something? Let's see: positions: index 0: (4,4), 1: (4,3), 2: (3,3), 3: (2,3), 4: (2,2), 5: (3,2), 6: (3,1), 7: (4,1), 8: (4,2), 9: (5,2), 10: (5,3), 11: (5,4). So (5,3) is segment 10, body segment, not tail. Tail is (5,4).\n> \n> (5,4) is tail, no food there.\n> \n> So moving R to (5,4): since it's tail, and we move there, but no food, so snake moves, head to (5,4), tail moves away, so no collision.\n> \n> But (5,4) is not food, so no eating.\n> \n> Now, D is not possible because reverse, cannot move opposite to current direction U.\n> \n> So possible actions: U, L, R.\n> \n> Now, U to (4,5), L to (3,4), R to (5,4).\n> \n> I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score, prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> Food available:\n> \n> - (6,3) at (6,3), life span 3, so must be eaten by turn 56, else disappears.\n> \n> - (5,3) at (5,3), life span 5, must be eaten by turn 58.\n> \n> - (1,5) at (1,5), life span 8, must be eaten by turn 61.\n> \n> But (5,3) is currently occupied by a body segment, segment 10 at (5,3). So it's under the body.\n> \n> Rule: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: the body moves away, and the head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> So for (5,3), it's under body, so to eat it, we need the body to move away from (5,3), then head moves to it.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,3) is free, not under body, I think. Positions: (6,3) not in snake positions, so free.\n> \n> (1,5) not in positions, free.\n> \n> Now, (5,3) is occupied, so we need to free that cell first.\n> \n> Current head position (4,4).\n> \n> If I move U to (4,5), then snake moves: head to (4,5), and tail moves away. So body segments shift: the segment at (4,3) moves to where? When snake moves, the head moves to new position, each segment moves to the previous position of the segment before it, and tail is removed unless food eaten.\n> \n> Since no food eaten, length same, tail (5,4) is removed, and new head at (4,5), body: (4,4) becomes segment 1, then (4,3) becomes segment 2, (3,3) segment 3, and so on, down to (5,3) becomes segment 11? Let's list new positions after move U.\n> \n> Current positions: [(4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4)]\n> \n> After move U without eating: head moves to (4,5), then body: the first segment moves to old head position (4,4), second to old first segment (4,3), and so on, so the tail (5,4) is removed.\n> \n> New positions: head (4,5), then (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3)  -- since tail removed, last is (5,3) now? Original 12 segments, after move, no food, so 11 segments? Length decreases only if no food, but since no food eaten, snake shortens by one? No.\n> \n> Rule: when no food eaten, snake moves: head to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so the last segment (tail) is removed, so length decreases by one? But in Snake, when no food eaten, the tail moves, so the snake length stays the same, but it occupies one less cell temporarily? No.\n> \n> Standard Snake: when no food, head moves to new cell, tail is removed, so the snake length remains the same, but the tail position changes.\n> \n> For example, positions: [H, B1, B2, ..., T]\n> \n> After move to new cell without eating: new positions [H_new, H_old, B1_old, ..., T_old except last removed?]\n> \n> Let's index: positions P[0] to P[11] with P[0] head, P[11] tail.\n> \n> After move to new cell, no food: new head at new position, then P[0] becomes segment 1, P[1] becomes segment 2, ..., P[10] becomes segment 11, and P[11] is removed. So new positions: [new_head, P[0], P[1], P[2], ..., P[10]] , so 11 segments, length decreased by one? But that can't be right.\n> \n> I think I have a mistake.\n> \n> In Snake game, the snake length increases only when it eats food; otherwise, when it moves, the head moves to a new cell, and the tail is left, so the snake occupies the same number of cells, but shifted.\n> \n> For example, start: positions [A, B, C] with A head, C tail.\n> \n> Move to new cell D: if no food, new positions [D, A, B], C is no longer part of snake, so tail was C, now B is tail.\n> \n> Length same, but positions changed.\n> \n> Similarly here: from [P0, P1, P2, ..., P11] with P0 head, P11 tail.\n> \n> After move to new cell Q without eating: new positions [Q, P0, P1, P2, ..., P10], and P11 is removed. So new length is 12, same as before? [Q, P0, P1, ..., P10] that's 12 positions: Q, and P0 to P10, that's 11+1=12 positions. P0 to P10 is 11 elements, plus Q, so 12 elements, length same.\n> \n> For example, P0 to P11 is 12 positions.\n> \n> After move: new head at Q, then the old head P0 becomes the new first body segment, P1 becomes second, ..., P10 becomes the 11th body segment, and P11 is gone, so new tail is P10.\n> \n> Positions: new [Q, P0, P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, P6, P7, P8, P9, P10]  that's 12 positions: index 0: Q (head), 1: P0 (was head, now body), 2: P1, 3: P2, ..., 11: P10 (was the 10th segment, now tail).\n> \n> P10 is (5,3) in this case.\n> \n> Similarly, if eat food, new positions [Q, P0, P1, ..., P11], length increased.\n> \n> Back to move.\n> \n> If I move U to (4,5), no food there, so new head at (4,5), body: (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3)  -- and (5,4) is removed, so tail is now (5,3).\n> \n> (5,3) was a body segment, now tail.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (5,3) is under the body, but now after move, (5,3) is the tail position. But the food is there, but since it's under the tail, we can't eat it yet; the body (tail) needs to move away for the food to be accessible.\n> \n> After move U, positions include (5,3) as tail, so food at (5,3) is still under snake, not eatable.\n> \n> Similarly, other moves.\n> \n> I need to plan to eat the foods.\n> \n> First, (6,3) is close, at (6,3), life span 3, so we have until turn 56 to eat it.\n> \n> Current position (4,4).\n> \n> To reach (6,3), we can go right then down, but let's see the path.\n> \n> From (4,4) to (6,3): one way is R to (5,4), then if possible, but (5,4) is tail now, but after move, it might change.\n> \n> Since head direction U, but we can change.\n> \n> Also, there is the tail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills snake because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> But here, tail is at (5,4), no food there.\n> \n> Food at (5,3), which is body.\n> \n> Let's list all food:\n> \n> - (6,3): free, can be eaten if head moves there.\n> \n> - (5,3): under body, need body to move away first.\n> \n> - (1,5): free.\n> \n> Now, life spans short for (6,3), only 3 turns left.\n> \n> So we might want to eat (6,3) soon.\n> \n> But to eat it, we need to move to (6,3).\n> \n> From (4,4), we can move R to (5,4), then from there, possible moves to (6,4) or (5,5) or (5,3), but (5,3) is body, not safe unless tail.\n> \n> After move R to (5,4): head to (5,4), which is current tail, so no collision, since tail moves.\n> \n> After move R: head to (5,4), no food there, so new positions: head (5,4), body: (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3)  -- tail is (5,3).\n> \n> Now, (5,3) is tail and has food?

I'm messing up.\n> \n> Let's clarify with a small example.\n> \n> Suppose snake: head at (1,1), body at (1,2), tail at (1,3). So positions [(1,1), (1,2), (1,3)].\n> \n> Move down to (1,0) where there is food. New head at (1,0), then old head (1,1), then old body (1,2), and since food eaten, tail stays, so new tail is (1,3)? New positions: [ (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3) ] with head (1,0), tail (1,3).\n> \n> The old tail (1,3) is still there as tail.\n> \n> In the cell (1,3), it was tail, and now it's still occupied by the snake.\n> \n> Similarly, in our case, after eating at (5,3), new positions: head at (5,3), then old head (5,4), then old body segments: (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (5,2), and the old tail (5,3) is not included because the new head is at (5,3), and the new tail is the last body segment, which is (5,2).\n> \n> Old positions had 12 segments: index 0 to 11: 0:(5,4) head, 1:(4,4), 2:(4,3), 3:(3,3), 4:(2,3), 5:(2,2), 6:(3,2), 7:(3,1), 8:(4,1), 9:(4,2), 10:(5,2), 11:(5,3) tail.\n> \n> After moving to (5,3) and eating: new head at (5,3), then old head (5,4), then old body 1 to 10: (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (5,2), and since food eaten, we add a new segment at the end, which is the position of the old tail, but the old tail position is (5,3), which is now the head, so we add a new segment at the old tail position, but it's occupied, so instead, the new segment is added at the position where the tail was before the move, but since the tail didn't move, it's the same.\n> \n> In practice, the new positions are: new head at food cell, then the old head position, then the old body positions in order, and the old tail position is included as the new last segment.\n> \n> But in the list, it's [new_head, old_head, old_body1, old_body2, ..., old_bodyk, old_tail] with old_bodyk being the one before tail.\n> \n> In this case, old_body10 is (5,2), old_tail is (5,3).\n> \n> New positions: [ (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3) ] but (5,3) is duplicate, so it's wrong.\n> \n> The correct way: when eating food, the head moves to the food cell, and the tail does not move, so the snake grows by one segment. The new segment is added at the tail position, but since the tail doesn't move, the position is the same, but in the list, it's the same as before but with head moved.\n> \n> New positions: the new head is at the food cell, then the old head position becomes the new first body segment, the old first body becomes second, and so on, up to the old tail position, which remains as the new tail, but since we add a segment, the old tail position is now a body segment, and the new tail is the old tail position? I'm stuck.\n> \n> I think for simplicity, in terms of positions, after eating, the snake has one more segment, with the new head at the food cell, and the body includes all old positions including the old tail, so the old tail is now a body segment, and the new tail is the position that was the second last or something.\n> \n> In the example: old positions: [A, B, C] with A head, C tail.\n> \n> Move to food at D: new positions [D, A, B, C] with D head, C tail.\n> \n> Length increased.\n> \n> Similarly here: before move to (5,3): positions [ (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3) ] with (5,4) head, (5,3) tail.\n> \n> Move to (5,3): eat food, so new positions: [ (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3) ] but (5,3) is at both head and end, so it's [ (5,3) head, then (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (5,2), and (5,3) again? No, the last should be the old tail, but it's the same as head position.\n> \n> The new positions should be: new head at (5,3), then the old head (5,4), then the old body segments from index 1 to 10: (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (5,2), and then the old tail (5,3) is not added because the new head is there, and since we ate food, we add a new segment at the end, which is the position where the tail was, but it's occupied, so the new segment is added at the position that the tail was before the move, but it's the same cell.\n> \n> In practice, the new tail position is the old tail position, and it's occupied, but the snake has grown, so the new positions include the new head and all old positions, with the old tail becoming the new second last segment.\n> \n> For example, new positions: [ (5,3) new head, (5,4) old head, then (4,4) old body1, (4,3) old body2, (3,3) old body3, (2,3) old body4, (2,2) old body5, (3,2) old body6, (3,1) old body7, (4,1) old body8, (4,2) old body9, (5,2) old body10, and then since food eaten, add new segment at position of old tail, which is (5,3), but (5,3) is already head, so we can't.\n> \n> This is confusing.\n> \n> I recall that in Snake, when the head eats food, it moves to the food cell, and the tail does not advance, so the snake grows by one cell at the tail end. So the new positions are the old positions with the new head prepended and the tail not removed.\n> \n> So from [H, B1, B2, ..., Bk, T] to [new_H, H, B1, B2, ..., Bk, T] with new_H at food cell.\n> \n> In this case, new_H at (5,3), then H at (5,4), then B1 at (4,4), B2 at (4,3), ..., B10 at (5,2), and T at (5,3), but T at (5,3) and new_H at (5,3) same cell, so the list has new_H at (5,3), H at (5,4), B1 at (4,4), ..., B10 at (5,2), and T at (5,3), so (5,3) appears twice, which is impossible.\n> \n> The error is that the food cell was occupied by the tail, so when head moves to it, it's eating the food, but the tail was there, so after eating, the tail position is the same as head, but it should be that the head moves to the food cell, and the tail remains, but since the food was under the tail, after eating, the tail is still there, but it's not a new segment; it's the same.\n> \n> Perhaps for food under body, when the body moves away, the food is revealed, and then head can eat it.\n> \n> In this case, at (5,3), it was under body, so when we move the snake, if the segment at (5,3) moves away, then the food is there, and head can move to it.\n> \n> But in the move I described, when we move to (5,4), the segment at (5,3) is now tail, so it's still occupied, but if we move the tail away, then (5,3) becomes free.\n> \n> Let's go back to the current state.\n> \n> At turn 54, head at (4,4), direction U.\n> \n> Food at (5,3) is under body segment.\n> \n> To eat it, we need the body to move away from (5,3), then head moves to it.\n> \n> Currently, (5,3) is occupied

(3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3) -- tail at (5,3), so (5,3) is still occupied by tail, food under it.\n> \n> If we move L to (3,4), let's see.\n> \n> Move L to (3,4): (3,4) is free, no food,

(5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (5,2), and new segment at old tail position, but old tail was at (5,3), which is now head, so instead, the new segment is added at the position where the tail was, but it's occupied, so in practice, the snake grows, but the new head is at (5,3), and the body includes (5,4), (4,4), ..., (5,2), and the new tail is (5,2), with no collision.\n> \n> But the tail reward danger says that if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has food, eating it causes collision because the head and newly grown tail collide.\n> \n> After

not the same cell, so no collision.\n> \n> But the rule says they will collide, so perhaps in the growth, the new tail is added at the old tail position, but it's occupied.\n> \n> I think the danger is when the head and tail are adjacent, and the tail cell has food, if you eat it, the head moves to tail cell, and the new tail is grown at the same position, causing collision, but that doesn't make sense.\n> \n> Perhaps it's a different scenario.\n> \n> Another interpretation: if the head is adjacent to the tail, and the tail cell has food, if you move to it, you eat the food, but then the new head is at the tail position, and the new tail is the old head position, but since they were adjacent, after move, the new head and new tail are not adjacent if you moved diagonally or something, but in this case, from (5,4) to (5,3), both on same row.\n> \n> Before move, head (5,4), tail (5,3), adjacent horizontally.\n> \n> After move and eat, new head at (5,3), new body at (5,4), and new tail at (5,2) or something, so head at (5,3), body at (5,4), which is adjacent, but not collision unless head moves into body later.\n> \n> But immediately, no collision.\n> \n> The rule says \"the head and newly grown tail will collide\" but the newly grown tail is not at the same position.\n> \n> I think there might be a misunderstanding.\n> \n> Perhaps \"newly grown tail\" means that after eating, the tail doesn't move, so the position is the same, but the head is now there, so collision.\n> \n> But in the move, the head moves to the cell, so at that moment, it's occupied, but in the new state, the head is there, and the tail is elsewhere.\n> \n> I think for safety, it's better to avoid such moves when head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has food.\n> \n> The rule says it kills the snake, so we should avoid it.\n> \n> In this case, for (5,3), since head at (4,4) is not adjacent to tail (5,4), distance: (4,4) to (5,4) is adjacent, tail is (5,4), so head at (4,4), tail at (5,4), so they are

It's turn 54. The grid has walls: border cells at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and an internal obstacle at (3,6). So, the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), but with walls on the borders and that one obstacle.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (4,4), then body segments: (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4). Let me list them in order:\n> \n> - Head: (4,4)\n> \n> - Segment 1: (4,3)\n> \n> - Segment 2: (3,3)\n> \n> - Segment 3: (2,3)\n> \n> - Segment 4: (2,2)\n> \n> - Segment 5: (3,2)\n> \n> - Segment 6: (3,1)\n> \n> - Segment 7: (4,1)\n> \n> - Segment 8: (4,2)\n> \n> - Segment 9: (5,2)\n> \n> - Segment 10: (5,3)\n> \n> - Segment 11: (5,4)\n> \n> That's 12 segments?

So currently moving upwards.\n> \n> Food:\n> \n> - (6,3) with life span 3, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (5,3) with life span 5, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (1,5) with life span 8, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> All food is positive, no negative food mentioned.\n> \n> Life span decreases every turn, including current, so for (6,3), life span 3 means it disappears after 3 turns from now? Life span is given, and it decreases each turn, so at turn 54, life span 3 means it will disappear after turn 56? Let's clarify.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So at turn t, if life span is L, it decreases to L-1 at turn t+1, and when it reaches 0, it disappears. So if life span is L at turn t, it will be gone after turn t + L - 1? No.\n> \n> Example: at turn t, life span L. After turn t, it decreases to L-1. So it exists for L more turns? Let's think.\n> \n> If at turn t, life span is L, then:\n> \n> - At turn t: life span L\n> \n> - Turn t+1: life span L-1\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - Turn t + L - 1: life span 1\n> \n> - Turn t + L: life span 0, disappears before turn t+L+1? But since countdown decreases every turn including current, and disappears after N turns, meaning after N turns from now it's gone.\n> \n> The rule: \"Disappears after N turns\" and N is life_span at current turn.\n> \n> So for food at (6,3): life span 3 at turn 54, so it will disappear after 3 turns, meaning after turn 56? Turn 54: present, turn 55: present with life span 2, turn 56: present with life span 1, turn 57: gone? \"Disappears after N turns\" – after N turns from now.\n> \n> I think it means that it will not be present on turn t + N. So at turn t, life span N, it exists for turns t, t+1, ..., t+N-1, and disappears at turn t+N.\n> \n> Similarly here: at turn 54, life span 3 for (6,3), so it exists on turns 54, 55, 56, and disappears on turn 57.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,3) life span 5 at turn 54, exists until turn 58 (turns 54 to 58 inclusive? Turn 54: life span 5, turn 55:4, ..., turn 58: life span 1, turn 59: gone? After 5 turns from turn 54, so after turn 59 it is gone? Let's define:\n> \n> If at turn t, life span N, then:\n> \n> - Turn t: life span N\n> \n> - Turn t+1: life span N-1\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - Turn t + (N-1): life span 1\n> \n> - Turn t + N: life span 0, disappears, so not present.\n> \n> So for (6,3): life span 3 at turn 54, so present on turns 54,55,56, gone on turn 57.\n> \n> For (5,3): life span 5, present on turns 54,55,56,57,58, gone on turn 59.\n> \n> For (1,5): life span 8, present on turns 54 to 61, gone on turn 62.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (4,4), direction U. Possible moves: U, D, L, R, but cannot reverse instantly. Since direction is U, reverse is D, so cannot move D immediately. So possible moves: U, L, R.\n> \n> Now, adjacent cells:\n> \n> - U: (4,5) – up\n> \n> - D: (4,3) – but (4,3) is occupied by the body, segment 1, and it's not the tail. Tail is at (5,4)? Positions: head (4,4), then (4,3), (3,3), ..., (5,4) is the last, so tail is (5,4).\n> \n> Moving to (4,3) would be body collision, since (4,3) is a body segment and not the tail. Only tail is safe to move into if it moves away.\n> \n> Rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, for a cell occupied by a body segment:\n> \n> - If it's the tail, and tail moves away, it's safe.\n> \n> - Otherwise, collision and death.\n> \n> In this case, (4,3) is the first segment after head, so not tail. Tail is (5,4).\n> \n> Also, walls: borders, so x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Internal obstacle (3,6).\n> \n> Now, let's list possible moves from (4,4):\n> \n> - U: to (4,5). Is this safe? Check if wall or body.\n> \n> (4,5): x=4, y=5. Not on border walls since x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7, so (4,5) is within, not wall. Internal obstacles: (3,6), not (4,5). Body positions: snake positions are all listed, (4,5) not in the list, so empty. So (4,5) is free and safe to move to.\n> \n> - L: to (3,4). (3,4): not wall, not body? Positions: (4,4) head, (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), etc. (3,4) not in list, so free. Also not wall or obstacle. Obstacle is (3,6), not (3,4). So (3,4) free.\n> \n> - R: to (5,4). (5,4): not wall? x=5, y=4, within grid. But (5,4) is the tail of the snake. Positions: (5,4) is the last segment, tail. So moving to (5,4) is moving to tail cell. Since tail will move, it might be safe if we eat food or not? We only eat food if we move head to a food cell. (5,4) has food? Food positions: (6,3), (5,3), (1,5). (5,3) is food, but (5,4) is not food. (5,4) is the tail position, not food.\n> \n> So moving to (5,4) is moving to the tail cell. Since it's the tail, and if we don't eat food there, the tail will move, so it should be safe. But is there food at (5,4)? No, food is at (5,3), which is different. (5,3) is a body segment? Positions: (5,3) is segment 10 or something? Let's see: positions: index 0: (4,4), 1: (4,3), 2: (3,3), 3: (2,3), 4: (2,2), 5: (3,2), 6: (3,1), 7: (4,1), 8: (4,2), 9: (5,2), 10: (5,3), 11: (5,4). So (5,3) is segment 10, body segment, not tail. Tail is (5,4).\n> \n> (5,4) is tail, no food there.\n> \n> So moving R to (5,4): since it's tail, and we move there, but no food, so snake moves, head to (5,4), tail moves away, so no collision.\n> \n> But (5,4) is not food, so no eating.\n> \n> Now, D is not possible because reverse, cannot move opposite to current direction U.\n> \n> So possible actions: U, L, R.\n> \n> Now, U to (4,5), L to (3,4), R to (5,4).\n> \n> I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score, prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> Food available:\n> \n> - (6,3) at (6,3), life span 3, so must be eaten by turn 56, else disappears.\n> \n> - (5,3) at (5,3), life span 5, must be eaten by turn 58.\n> \n> - (1,5) at (1,5), life span 8, must be eaten by turn 61.\n> \n> But (5,3) is currently occupied by a body segment, segment 10 at (5,3). So it's under the body.\n> \n> Rule: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: the body moves away, and the head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> So for (5,3), it's under body, so to eat it, we need the body to move away from (5,3), then head moves to it.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,3) is free, not under body, I think. Positions: (6,3) not in snake positions, so free.\n> \n> (1,5) not in positions, free.\n> \n> Now, (5,3) is occupied, so we need to free that cell first.\n> \n> Current head position (4,4).\n> \n> If I move U to (4,5), then snake moves: head to (4,5), and tail moves away. So body segments shift: the segment at (4,3) moves to where? When snake moves, the head moves to new position, each segment moves to the previous position of the segment before it, and tail is removed unless food eaten.\n> \n> Since no food eaten, length same, tail (5,4) is removed, and new head at (4,5), body: (4,4) becomes segment 1, then (4,3) becomes segment 2, (3,3) segment 3, and so on, down to (5,3) becomes segment 11? Let's list new positions after move U.\n> \n> Current positions: [(4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4)]\n> \n> After move U without eating: head moves to (4,5), then body: the first segment moves to old head position (4,4), second to old first segment (4,3), and so on, so the tail (5,4) is removed.\n> \n> New positions: head (4,5), then (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3)  -- since tail removed, last is (5,3) now? Original 12 segments, after move, no food, so 11 segments? Length decreases only if no food, but since no food eaten, snake shortens by one? No.\n> \n> Rule: when no food eaten, snake moves: head to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so the last segment (tail) is removed, so length decreases by one? But in Snake, when no food eaten, the tail moves, so the snake length stays the same, but it occupies one less cell temporarily? No.\n> \n> Standard Snake: when no food, head moves to new cell, tail is removed, so the snake length remains the same, but the tail position changes.\n> \n> For example, positions: [H, B1, B2, ..., T]\n> \n> After move to new cell without eating: new positions [H_new, H_old, B1_old, ..., T_old except last removed?]\n> \n> Let's index: positions P[0] to P[11] with P[0] head, P[11] tail.\n> \n> After move to new cell, no food: new head at new position, then P[0] becomes segment 1, P[1] becomes segment 2, ..., P[10] becomes segment 11, and P[11] is removed. So new positions: [new_head, P[0], P[1], P[2], ..., P[10]] , so 11 segments, length decreased by one? But that can't be right.\n> \n> I think I have a mistake.\n> \n> In Snake game, the snake length increases only when it eats food; otherwise, when it moves, the head moves to a new cell, and the tail is left, so the snake occupies the same number of cells, but shifted.\n> \n> For example, start: positions [A, B, C] with A head, C tail.\n> \n> Move to new cell D: if no food, new positions [D, A, B], C is no longer part of snake, so tail was C, now B is tail.\n> \n> Length same, but positions changed.\n> \n> Similarly here: from [P0, P1, P2, ..., P11] with P0 head, P11 tail.\n> \n> After move to new cell Q without eating: new positions [Q, P0, P1, P2, ..., P10], and P11 is removed.

I'm stuck.\n> \n> I think for simplicity, in terms of positions, after eating, the snake has one more segment, with the new head at the food cell, and the body includes all old positions including the old tail, so the old tail is now a body segment, and the new tail is the position that was the second last or something.\n> \n> In the example: old positions: [A, B, C] with A head, C tail.\n> \n> Move to food at D: new positions [D, A, B, C] with D head, C tail.\n> \n> Length increased.\n> \n> Similarly here: before move to (5,3): positions [ (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3) ] with (5,4) head, (5,3) tail.\n> \n> Move to (5,3): eat food, so new positions: [ (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3) ] but (5,3) is at both head and end, so it's [ (5,3) head, then (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (5,2), and (5,3) again?

(5,4), B1 at (4,4), ..., B10 at (5,2), and T at (5,3), so (5,3) appears twice, which is impossible.\n> \n> The error is that the food cell was occupied by the tail, so when head moves to it, it's eating the food, but the tail was there, so after eating, the tail position is the same as head, but it should be that the head moves to the food cell, and the tail remains, but since the food was under the tail, after eating, the tail is still there, but it's not a new segment; it's the same.\n> \n> Perhaps for food under body, when the body moves away, the food is revealed, and then head can eat it.\n> \n> In this case, at (5,3), it was under body, so when we move the snake, if the segment at (5,3) moves away, then the food is there, and head can move to it.\n> \n> But in the move I

That's 12 segments, so the snake is 12 units long.\n> \n> Head direction is left (L), meaning the snake was moving left to get to (5,5) from (6,5), I assume.

Let's clarify.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".

It's turn 59, and I'm the snake. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and one internal obstacle at (3,6). So the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), but with (3,6) blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (4,5), and the body segments follow: (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1). So the tail is at (3,1).

No negative food here.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan an action sequence for at least 5 turns ahead, but since the food at (5,3) has life span 1, it might be urgent. Life span decreases every turn, including the current one, so at turn 59, if I don't eat it now, it will disappear.\n> \n> Life span: it says \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So for food at (5,3) with life span 1, it means it will disappear after turn 59. If I move to it on turn 59, I can eat it; otherwise, it's gone.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,5) has life span 3, so it will disappear after turn 61? Let's clarify.\n> \n> Turn current is t1=59.\n> \n> For food with life span L, it disappears after t1 + L - 1? I need to think carefully.\n> \n> The rule says: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So at turn t, if life span is L, it will be present for L turns, including turn t. After L turns, it's gone.\n> \n> For example, at turn t, life span L: available on turns t, t+1, ..., t+L-1? Let's see.\n> \n> It says \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so at turn t, countdown is L. After turn t, countdown becomes L-1, and so on, until countdown=0, then it disappears.\n> \n> But when countdown=1, it's still available on that turn, and after that turn, it disappears.\n> \n> Similarly, when placed, at turn placed, countdown=N, decreases each turn.\n> \n> In this case, for food at (5,3): life span 1 at turn 59. So countdown=1, meaning it is available on turn 59. After turn 59, it disappears, so if not eaten by end of turn 59, it's gone.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,5): life span 3 at turn 59, so available on turns 59, 60, 61.

Head at (4,5), direction L, so last move was left to (4,5). Possible moves: since direction is L, I can move L (left), U (up), or D (down), but not R (right) because that would be instant reverse.

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State (Turn 61)\n\nFirst, let's summarize the current state at Turn 61 based on the provided information:\n\n- **Snake Positions**: The snake's body segments are listed from head to tail as follows:\n  - Head: (3, 4)\n  - Body: (3, 5), (4, 5), (5, 5), (6, 5), (6, 4), (5, 4), (4, 4), (4, 3), (3, 3), (2, 3), (2, 2)\n- **Snake Head Direction**: The head is currently moving Down (D).\n- **Food Items**:\n  - (1, 5): Value = +1, Life Span = 2 (will disappear after Turn 62)\n  - (1, 1): Value = +1, Life Span = 4 (will disappear after Turn 64)\n  - (1, 4): Value = +1, Life Span = 7 (will disappear after Turn 67)\n  - (2, 2): Value = +1, Life Span = 10 (will disappear after Turn 70)\n- **Walls and Obstacles**:\n  - Border walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.\n  - Internal obstacle at (3, 6).\n\n### Previous Plan from Turn 60\n\nFrom the previous thinking model at Turn 60, the plan was to:\n\n1. Move Left (L) to (2, 5) at Turn 60.\n2. Move Left (L) to (1, 5) at Turn 61 to eat the food there.\n3. Move Down (D) to (1, 4) at Turn 62 to eat the food there.\n4. Move Right (R) to (2, 4) at Turn 63.\n5. Move Down (D) to (2, 3) at Turn 64.\n\nHowever, we are now at Turn 61, and the snake's head is at (3, 4), moving Down (D). This suggests that the previous plan's first move (L at Turn 60) was not executed as intended, possibly due to a change in the snake's position or direction.\n\n### Determining Possible Moves at Turn 61\n\nGiven the current head position (3, 4) and direction Down (D), the possible moves are:\n\n1. **Up (U)**: (3, 5)\n   - Check: (3, 5) is part of the snake's body (second segment). Moving here would cause a collision. **Invalid**.\n2. **Down (D)**: (3, 3)\n   - Check: (3, 3) is part of the snake's body (ninth segment). Moving here would cause a collision. **Invalid**.\n3. **Left (L)**: (2, 4)\n   - Check: (2, 4) is not occupied by the snake or walls. **Valid**.\n4. **Right (R)**: (4, 4)\n   - Check: (4, 4) is part of the snake's body (seventh segment). Moving here would cause a collision. **Invalid**.\n\nAdditionally, we cannot move in the opposite direction of the current movement (Down's opposite is Up), but Up is already invalid due to collision.\n\nThus, the only valid move at Turn 61 is **Left (L)** to (2, 4).\n\n### Verifying the Move to (2, 4)\n\nMoving Left to (2, 4):\n\n- **New Head Position**: (2, 4)\n- **Direction**: Now moving Left (L).\n- **Food Check**: (2, 4) does not have food, so no eating occurs.\n- **Snake Body Update**:\n  - The head moves to (2, 4).\n  - The tail (originally at (2, 2)) moves away, so the segment at (2, 2) is no longer part of the snake.\n\n### Next Steps After Moving to (2, 4)\n\nAfter moving to (2, 4), at Turn 62, the possible moves would be:\n\n1. **Up (U)**: (2, 5)\n   - Check: (2, 5) is not occupied by the snake or walls. **Valid**.\n2. **Down (D)**: (2, 3)\n   - Check: (2, 3) is part of the snake's body (tenth segment). Moving here would cause a collision. **Invalid**.\n3. **Left (L)**: (1, 4)\n   - Check: (1, 4) has food (+1). **Valid** and can eat.\n4. **Right (R)**: (3, 4)\n   - Check: (3, 4) is the previous head position, now part of the body. Moving here would cause a collision. **Invalid**.\n\nThe opposite direction restriction would prevent moving Right (opposite of Left), but Right is already invalid.\n\n### Deciding the Best Move at Turn 61\n\nGiven that at Turn 61, the only valid move is Left to (2, 4), and considering the previous plan aimed to eat (1, 5) and (1, 4), we should proceed with this move to align with the strategy of consuming available food while avoiding collisions.\n\nHowever, since the snake is now at (3, 4) moving Down, and the only safe move is Left to (2, 4), we must adjust the plan accordingly. The food at (1, 5) is still reachable by moving Left to (2, 4) now, then Left to (1, 4) next (but (1, 5) is at (1,5), not (1,4)). \n\nWait, let's clarify:\n\nFrom (2, 4) at Turn 62:\n- Moving Left to (1, 4) would eat the food there (life span 7).\n- Moving Up to (2, 5) could then allow moving Left to (1, 5) at Turn 63 to eat that food (life span 2, so must be eaten by Turn 62).\n\nBut at Turn 62, (1, 5) can still be eaten (life span 2 at Turn 60 means it's present at Turns 60, 61, 62; disappears at Turn 63). So to eat (1,5), we must be at (1,5) by Turn 62.\n\nFrom (2,4) at Turn 62:\n- Move Left to (1,4) at Turn 62: eats (1,4), but misses (1,5).\n- Move Up to (2,5) at Turn 62: then at Turn 63, can move Left to (1,5) to eat it (but it's Turn 63, and (1,5) disappears after Turn 62). So cannot eat (1,5) this way.\n\nThus, the only way to eat (1,5) is to be at (1,5) by Turn 62, meaning:\n\n- Turn 61: from (3,4), move Left to (2,4).\n- Turn 62: from (2,4), move Left to (1,4) to eat (1,4), but cannot reach (1,5) in time.\n\nAlternatively, if at Turn 61 we could have moved Up to (3,5), but that's invalid due to body collision.\n\nGiven that, the food at (1,5) is unreachable from the current position at Turn 61 because:\n\nFrom (3,4):\n- Only valid move is Left to (2,4).\nFrom (2,4):\n- To reach (1,5), need to go Up to (2,5) then Left to (1,5), but that takes two moves (Turns 62 and 63), and (1,5) disappears after Turn 62.\n\nThus, we cannot eat (1,5) from the current position. The next best is to eat (1,4):\n\n- Turn 61: Left to (2,4).\n- Turn 62: Left to (1,4) to eat.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Dangers\n\nBefore finalizing the move, ensure that moving Left to (2,4) does not lead to immediate danger:\n\n- (2,4) is not adjacent to the tail (tail is at (2,2)), so no tail reward danger.\n- No walls or obstacles at (2,4).\n\n### Final Decision\n\nGiven the above analysis, the best immediate action at Turn 61 is to move Left to (2,4), setting up to eat (1,4) at Turn 62.\n\n\\boxed{L}",

It's turn 60. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and an internal obstacle at (3,6).

That means it disappears after 3 turns, including current turn, so it will be gone by turn 63? Life span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 60, life span is 3, so it will disappear after turn 62? Let me clarify.\n> \n> Life span: \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So for a food with life span N at turn t, it will be present for turns t, t+1, ..., t+N-1, and disappear at turn t+N. For example, at turn 60, life span 3 means it will be gone after turn 62, so it can be eaten on turn 60, 61, or 62.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,1) with value 1, life span 5: can be eaten from turn 60 to 64.\n> \n> (1,4) with value 1, life span 8: can be eaten from turn 60 to 67.\n> \n> All food has value +1, so positive food only, no negative food mentioned.

Eating it increases length by 1.\n   - New head at (2, 2), tail remains at (3, 3).\n   - Next steps: Can move left to (1, 2) on Turn 64, then down to (1, 1) on Turn 65 to eat the other food.\n   - **Pros**: Eats (2, 2) and (1, 1) (total +2).\n   - **Cons**: After eating (1, 1), the snake is stuck at the bottom-left and cannot reach (1, 4) in time.\n\n2. **Left (L) to (1, 3)**:\n   - (1, 3) is empty. No food eaten.\n   - New head at (1, 3), tail moves to (4, 3).\n   - Next steps: Can move up to (1, 4) on Turn 64 to eat the food there.\n   - **Pros**: Eats (1, 4) and can later eat (2, 2) (total +2).\n   - **Cons**: Misses (1, 1) due to time constraints.\n\n3. **Right (R) to (3, 3)**:\n   - (3, 3) is the tail. Safe to move here (tail will move away).\n   - New head at (3, 3), tail moves to (4, 3).\n   - Next steps: Can move down to (3, 2) on Turn 64, but this path doesn't lead to any food quickly.\n   - **Pros**: Keeps options open.\n   - **Cons**: Misses both (1, 1) and (1, 4).\n\n4. **Up (U) to (2, 4)**:\n   - Invalid: (2, 4) is a body segment (collision).\n\n### Decision:\n- The best immediate action is to **move left to (1, 3)**. This sets up the snake to eat (1, 4) on the next turn (Turn 64), and later (2, 2) can be eaten as well. While this misses (1, 1), it avoids getting stuck at the bottom-left and allows for more flexible movement afterward.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{L}",
        "state": "**Current Turn**: \\( t_0 = 63 \\)\n**Cells occupied by walls**:\n\t - Border Cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7.\n\t - Internal Obstacles: [(3, 6)]\n**Snake Positions**:[(2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5), (5, 5), (6, 5), (6, 4), (5, 4), (4, 4), (4, 3), (3, 3)]\n**Snake Head Direction**: D\n**Food Positions, Life Span and Value**:\n\t- (1, 1, 3, 1)\n\t- (1, 4, 5, 1)\n\t- (2, 2, 8, 1)\n> **Guidance from a Previous Thinking Model:** Turn \\( t_1 = 63 \\)\n> <think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 63, and I'm playing Snake on a grid with walls and obstacles. The grid has borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7). There's also an internal obstacle at (3,6).\n> \n> The snake's positions are given: head at (2,3), then body segments: (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3). The head direction is down (D), which means from (2,3), moving down would go to (2,2), but let's confirm the coordinates. Typically, in such grids, y increases upwards or downwards? The movement definitions: U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), so y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top? Let me clarify.\n> \n> The movement: U (x,y+1) – that means y increases as we go up, I think. D (x,y-1) – y decreases as we go down. So (0,0) is bottom-left or top-left? Usually, in such contexts, (0,0) is bottom-left, with y increasing up. But let's see the walls: border cells x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So y=0 is the bottom row, y=7 is the top row. Similarly, x=0 left, x=7 right.\n> \n> So, head at (2,3): x=2, y=3. Since y increases up, (2,3) is row 3, column 2. Moving down (D) would decrease y, so to (2,2). Moving up (U) would increase y to (2,4), but (2,4) is the second body segment, so moving up would hit the body.\n> \n> Current head direction is D, down. So last move was down to (2,3) from... positions: head (2,3), then (2,4), which is above it, so the snake was moving down from (2,4) to (2,3) at some point? Positions: [(2,3), (2,4), ...] so head is first, so at turn 63, head is at (2,3), and next segment is (2,4), which is directly above since y=4 > y=3, so from (2,4) to (2,3) is moving down. Yes, head direction D is consistent.\n> \n> Now, food positions:\n> \n> - (1,1) with life span 3, value +1 (positive food)\n> \n> - (1,4) with life span 5, value +1\n> \n> - (2,2) with life span 8, value +1\n> \n> All food has value +1, so no negative food here. Good.\n> \n> Life span: for (1,1), life span 3, meaning it disappears after 3 turns, including current turn? Countdown decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 63, life span is 3, so it will be gone after turn 65? Let's see: on turn t, life span L, it disappears after L turns, meaning on turn t + L, it's gone. Countdown decreases every turn, so:\n> \n> - On turn t, life span L: it will disappear after L more turns, so it exists from turn t to turn t + L - 1, and gone on turn t + L.\n> \n> The rule says: \"disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So, for example, if life span is N at turn t, then:\n> \n> - Turn t: countdown N\n> \n> - Turn t+1: countdown N-1\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - Turn t + N - 1: countdown 1\n> \n> - Turn t + N: countdown 0, disappears? Or after N turns means it disappears at the end of turn t + N?\n> \n> The rule says: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> I think it's safer to assume that at the start of turn t, food has life span L, it can be eaten during turn t, and at the end of the turn, life span decreases by 1. If life span reaches 0 after decrease, it disappears.\n> \n> But the rule doesn't specify exactly. Let me read: \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> Also, in the context, it says for food spawning under body, etc.\n> \n> For simplicity, I'll assume that when we are at turn t, and food has life span L, it means it has L turns left including this one. So after L turns, it's gone.\n> \n> For (1,1): at turn 63, life span 3, so it will disappear after turn 65 (since 63,64,65, gone at 66? Let's count:\n> \n> - Turn 63: life span 3, exists\n> \n> - Turn 64: life span 2, exists\n> \n> - Turn 65: life span 1, exists\n> \n> - Turn 66: life span 0, disappeared\n> \n> Similarly, (1,4): life span 5 at turn 63, so exists until turn 67 (63+5-1=67? Turn 63: L=5, turn 64: L=4, ..., turn 67: L=1, turn 68: L=0 gone? After N turns means after N full turns.\n> \n> I think it's better to think: disappears after N turns, so from turn t to turn t + N - 1 inclusive, gone on turn t + N.\n> \n> For (1,1): t=63, L=3, exists turns 63,64,65, gone turn 66.\n> \n> (1,4): L=5, exists turns 63 to 67, gone turn 68.\n> \n> (2,2): L=8, exists turns 63 to 70, gone turn 71.\n> \n> Now, the snake: head at (2,3), direction down, so from (2,3), possible moves: down to (2,2), left to (1,3), right to (3,3). But (3,3) is the tail? Positions: head (2,3), then (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3). So (3,3) is the last segment, the tail.\n> \n> If I move right to (3,3), that's the tail. But when the snake moves, the tail moves forward, so if head moves to (3,3), which is current tail, after move, the tail will be somewhere else, so it should be safe, as long as no other body collision.\n> \n> The rule says: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\" So moving to tail position is safe.\n> \n> Also, no instant reverse: current direction is down, so I cannot move up (opposite) on the next turn. But for this turn, since direction is given, I can choose any direction except the opposite? No, the no instant reverse is for the next turn based on current move.\n> \n> Let's read movement constraints: \"In each turn you can choose to move... No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\"\n> \n> It says \"on next turn\", so for the current turn, I can choose any direction, but after moving, the new direction must not be opposite to the new current direction for the next turn.\n> \n> For example, if I move down now, then next turn I cannot move up.\n> \n> But for this turn, since current direction is down, I can move down, left, or right, but not up, because moving up would be reverse? No, the constraint is for the next turn.\n> \n> Current head direction is D, meaning the snake was moving down to reach (2,3). So for this turn, when I choose a move, if I choose to move up, that would be opposite to current direction, but the rule says \"cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\" – it's a bit ambiguous.\n> \n> Let me read carefully: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\"\n> \n> I think it means that in the sequence of moves, from one turn to the next, you cannot do an immediate reverse. For example, if you move down on turn t, you cannot move up on turn t+1.\n> \n> But for the very first move, at turn t, the current direction is given, so when you choose a move for turn t, if you choose the opposite direction, is that allowed? The rule doesn't explicitly forbid it for the current move, only for the next turn relative to the current.\n> \n> But logically, if current direction is down, and you move up, that means you are reversing direction instantly, which might cause collision or something. But in terms of the grid, if you move up to (2,4), but (2,4) is the second segment, so it would collide.\n> \n> In this case, from (2,3), moving up to (2,4) is occupied by the body, so it's invalid and would cause collision.\n> \n> Similarly, moving left to (1,3), is that free? Let's see the grid.\n> \n> First, let's map out the grid.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls at borders, so cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Also internal obstacle at (3,6).\n> \n> So, cells that are walls: all (0,y) for y=0 to 7, all (7,y) for y=0 to7, all (x,0) for x=0 to7, all (x,7) for x=0 to7, and also (3,6).\n> \n> Now, snake positions: let's list the cells occupied by snake:\n> \n> - Head: (2,3)\n> \n> - Body: (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3)\n> \n> (3,3) is tail.\n> \n> Food at: (1,1), (1,4), (2,2)\n> \n> Now, from head (2,3), possible moves:\n> \n> - Down (D) to (2,2): y=2, x=2. Is this a wall? x=2 not 0 or 7, y=2 not 0 or 7, so not border wall. Internal obstacles: (3,6) is not (2,2), so free. But is it occupied by food or body? (2,2) has food, and it's not in snake positions, so it's free. Moving there would eat the food since head moves to food cell.\n> \n> - Left (L) to (1,3): x=1,y=3. Not wall, not obstacle, not snake body? Snake positions: (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), etc. (1,3) not listed, so free. Food? (1,3) not in food positions, so empty cell.\n> \n> - Right (R) to (3,3): (3,3) is the tail. As per rule, moving to tail is safe because tail will move. After move, the tail moves away.\n> \n> - Up (U) to (2,4): but (2,4) is the second segment, so moving there would collide with body. Also, it's opposite direction? Current direction down, moving up is reverse, but even if not, it's occupied.\n> \n> So possible moves from (2,3): D to (2,2), L to (1,3), R to (3,3). U is invalid due to body.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score, prioritizing long-term survival.\n> \n> Food available:\n> \n> - (2,2) at (2,2) with life span 8, so plenty of time.\n> \n> - (1,1) at (1,1) with life span 3, so must be eaten by turn 65.\n> \n> - (1,4) at (1,4) with life span 5, eaten by turn 67.\n> \n> (1,4) is at (1,4), which is above current position.\n> \n> Also, tail at (3,3), which is to the right.\n> \n> Now, if I move to (2,2) now, turn 63, I eat the food at (2,2), snake length increases by 1, so new head at (2,2), and tail stays or moves? When snake eats, it grows, so the tail doesn't move that turn.\n> \n> Rule: when eating positive food, length +1, so after moving to food, the tail remains, so snake gains a segment.\n> \n> Specifically, when head moves to food cell, if it's positive, snake grows: the new head is at the food, and the tail does not move, so the segment that was tail stays, and a new segment is added? No.\n> \n> Standard snake: when snake eats food, it moves forward, head to new position, and the tail does not retract, so length increases by one.\n> \n> In terms of positions, if head moves to a new cell, and it eats food, then the tail stays in place, so the snake extends.\n> \n> Otherwise, if no food, head moves to new cell, and tail moves off the last cell.\n> \n> In this case, positions list: when head moves, if to food, positions grow, else positions shift.\n> \n> But for collision, after move, the new head position should not collide with any body segment except possibly the tail if it moves away.\n> \n> In this case, if I move to (2,2), which has food, so I eat it, new head at (2,2), and the tail (3,3) remains, so the new positions would be: head (2,2), then previous head (2,3) becomes body, and so on, up to tail (3,3) still there, and since I ate, a new segment is added? No, when eating, the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move; so positions: new head (2,2), then the rest of the body: (2,3), (2,4), ..., up to (3,3), and since length increases, (3,3) is still tail, no new segment yet; the body has one more segment because tail didn't move.\n> \n> Initial positions: 12 segments?

It's turn 63, and I'm playing Snake on a grid with walls and obstacles. The grid has borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7). There's also an internal obstacle at (3,6).\n> \n> The snake's positions are given: head at (2,3), then body segments: (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3). The head direction is down (D), which means from (2,3), moving down would go to (2,2), but let's confirm the coordinates. Typically, in such grids, y increases upwards or downwards? The movement definitions: U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), so y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top? Let me clarify.\n> \n> The movement: U (x,y+1) – that means y increases as we go up, I think. D (x,y-1) – y decreases as we go down. So (0,0) is bottom-left or top-left? Usually, in such contexts, (0,0) is bottom-left, with y increasing up. But let's see the walls: border cells x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So y=0 is the bottom row, y=7 is the top row. Similarly, x=0 left, x=7 right.\n> \n> So, head at (2,3): x=2, y=3. Since y increases up, (2,3) is row 3, column 2. Moving down (D) would decrease y, so to (2,2). Moving up (U) would increase y to (2,4), but (2,4) is the second body segment, so moving up would hit the body.\n> \n> Current head direction is D, down. So last move was down to (2,3) from... positions: head (2,3), then (2,4), which is above it, so the snake was moving down from (2,4) to (2,3) at some point? Positions: [(2,3), (2,4), ...] so head is first, so at turn 63, head is at (2,3), and next segment is (2,4), which is directly above since y=4 > y=3, so from (2,4) to (2,3) is moving down. Yes, head direction D is consistent.\n> \n> Now, food positions:\n> \n> - (1,1) with life span 3, value +1 (positive food)\n> \n> - (1,4) with life span 5, value +1\n> \n> - (2,2) with life span 8, value +1\n> \n> All food has value +1, so no negative food here. Good.\n> \n> Life span: for (1,1), life span 3, meaning it disappears after 3 turns, including current turn? Countdown decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 63, life span is 3, so it will be gone after turn 65? Let's see: on turn t, life span L, it disappears after L turns, meaning on turn t + L, it's gone. Countdown decreases every turn, so:\n> \n> - On turn t, life span L: it will disappear after L more turns, so it exists from turn t to turn t + L - 1, and gone on turn t + L.\n> \n> The rule says: \"disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So, for example, if life span is N at turn t, then:\n> \n> - Turn t: countdown N\n> \n> - Turn t+1: countdown N-1\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - Turn t + N - 1: countdown 1\n> \n> - Turn t + N: countdown 0, disappears? Or after N turns means it disappears at the end of turn t + N?\n> \n> The rule says: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> I think it's safer to assume that at the start of turn t, food has life span L, it can be eaten during turn t, and at the end of the turn, life span decreases by 1. If life span reaches 0 after decrease, it disappears.\n> \n> But the rule doesn't specify exactly. Let me read: \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> Also, in the context, it says for food spawning under body, etc.\n> \n> For simplicity, I'll assume that when we are at turn t, and food has life span L, it means it has L turns left including this one. So after L turns, it's gone.\n> \n> For (1,1): at turn 63, life span 3, so it will disappear after turn 65 (since 63,64,65, gone at 66? Let's count:\n> \n> - Turn 63: life span 3, exists\n> \n> - Turn 64: life span 2, exists\n> \n> - Turn 65: life span 1, exists\n> \n> - Turn 66: life span 0, disappeared\n> \n> Similarly, (1,4): life span 5 at turn 63, so exists until turn 67 (63+5-1=67? Turn 63: L=5, turn 64: L=4, ..., turn 67: L=1, turn 68: L=0 gone? After N turns means after N full turns.\n> \n> I think it's better to think: disappears after N turns, so from turn t to turn t + N - 1 inclusive, gone on turn t + N.\n> \n> For (1,1): t=63, L=3, exists turns 63,64,65, gone turn 66.\n> \n> (1,4): L=5, exists turns 63 to 67, gone turn 68.\n> \n> (2,2): L=8, exists turns 63 to 70, gone turn 71.\n> \n> Now, the snake: head at (2,3), direction down, so from (2,3), possible moves: down to (2,2), left to (1,3), right to (3,3). But (3,3) is the tail? Positions: head (2,3), then (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3). So (3,3) is the last segment, the tail.\n> \n> If I move right to (3,3), that's the tail. But when the snake moves, the tail moves forward, so if head moves to (3,3), which is current tail, after move, the tail will be somewhere else, so it should be safe, as long as no other body collision.\n> \n> The rule says: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\" So moving to tail position is safe.\n> \n> Also, no instant reverse: current direction is down, so I cannot move up (opposite) on the next turn. But for this turn, since direction is given, I can choose any direction except the opposite? No, the no instant reverse is for the next turn based on current move.\n> \n> Let's read movement constraints: \"In each turn you can choose to move... No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\"\n> \n> It says \"on next turn\", so for the current turn, I can choose any direction, but after moving, the new direction must not be opposite to the new current direction for the next turn.\n> \n> For example, if I move down now, then next turn I cannot move up.\n> \n> But for this turn, since current direction is down, I can move down, left, or right, but not up, because moving up would be reverse? No, the constraint is for the next turn.\n> \n> Current head direction is D, meaning the snake was moving down to reach (2,3). So for this turn, when I choose a move, if I choose to move up, that would be opposite to current direction, but the rule says \"cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\" – it's a bit ambiguous.\n> \n> Let me read carefully: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\"\n> \n> I think it means that in the sequence of moves, from one turn to the next, you cannot do an immediate reverse. For example, if you move down on turn t, you cannot move up on turn t+1.\n> \n> But for the very first move, at turn t, the current direction is given, so when you choose a move for turn t, if you choose the opposite direction, is that allowed? The rule doesn't explicitly forbid it for the current move, only for the next turn relative to the current.\n> \n> But logically, if current direction is down, and you move up, that means you are reversing direction instantly, which might cause collision or something. But in terms of the grid, if you move up to (2,4), but (2,4) is the second segment, so it would collide.\n> \n> In this case, from (2,3), moving up to (2,4) is occupied by the body, so it's invalid and would cause collision.\n> \n> Similarly, moving left to (1,3), is that free? Let's see the grid.\n> \n> First, let's map out the grid.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls at borders, so cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Also internal obstacle at (3,6).\n> \n> So, cells that are walls: all (0,y) for y=0 to 7, all (7,y) for y=0 to7, all (x,0) for x=0 to7, all (x,7) for x=0 to7, and also (3,6).\n> \n> Now, snake positions: let's list the cells occupied by snake:\n> \n> - Head: (2,3)\n> \n> - Body: (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (4,3), (3,3)\n> \n> (3,3) is tail.\n> \n> Food at: (1,1), (1,4), (2,2)\n> \n> Now, from head (2,3), possible moves:\n> \n> - Down (D) to (2,2): y=2, x=2. Is this a wall? x=2 not 0 or 7, y=2 not 0 or 7, so not border wall. Internal obstacles: (3,6) is not (2,2), so free. But is it occupied by food or body? (2,2) has food, and it's not in snake positions, so it's free. Moving there would eat the food since head moves to food cell.\n> \n> - Left (L) to (1,3): x=1,y=3. Not wall, not obstacle, not snake body? Snake positions: (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), etc. (1,3) not listed, so free. Food? (1,3) not in food positions, so empty cell.\n> \n> - Right (R) to (3,3): (3,3) is the tail. As per rule, moving to tail is safe because tail will move. After move, the tail moves away.\n> \n> - Up (U) to (2,4): but (2,4) is the second segment, so moving there would collide with body. Also, it's opposite direction? Current direction down, moving up is reverse, but even if not, it's occupied.\n> \n> So possible moves from (2,3): D to (2,2), L to (1,3), R to (3,3). U is invalid due to body.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score, prioritizing long-term survival.\n> \n> Food available:\n> \n> - (2,2) at (2,2) with life span 8, so plenty of time.\n> \n> - (1,1) at (1,1) with life span 3, so must be eaten by turn 65.\n> \n> - (1,4) at (1,4) with life span 5, eaten by turn 67.\n> \n> (1,4) is at (1,4), which is above current position.\n> \n> Also, tail at (3,3), which is to the right.\n> \n> Now, if I move to (2,2) now, turn 63, I eat the food at (2,2), snake length increases by 1, so new head at (2,2), and tail stays or moves?

No.\n> \n> Standard snake: when snake eats food, it moves forward, head to new position, and the tail does not retract, so length increases by one.\n> \n> In terms of positions, if head moves to a new cell, and it eats food, then the tail stays in place, so the snake extends.\n> \n> Otherwise, if no food, head moves to new cell, and tail moves off the last cell.\n> \n> In this case, positions list: when head moves, if to food, positions grow, else positions shift.\n> \n> But for collision, after move, the new head position should not collide with any body segment except possibly the tail if it moves away.\n> \n> In this case, if I move to (2,2), which has food, so I eat it, new head at (2,2), and the tail (3,3) remains, so the new positions would be: head (2,2), then previous head (2,3) becomes body, and so on, up to tail (3,3) still there, and since I ate, a new segment is added? No, when eating, the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move; so positions: new head (2,2), then the rest of the body: (2,3), (2,4), ..., up to (3,3), and since length increases, (3,3) is still tail, no new segment yet; the body has one more segment because tail didn't move.\n> \n> Initial positions: 12 segments?

Subsequent moves (right on turns 66-67) avoid body collisions and steer toward open grid areas for long-term survival, accepting the loss of (1,4) due to inaccessibility within its life span after securing (1,1).\n",
