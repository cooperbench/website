So positions: [(3,5), (3,4)]\n> \n> Then, for next moves, when I move, the head moves, and tail follows or stays depending on food.\n> \n> Similarly, if I had moved to food directly, but here (3,3) to (3,5) is not adjacent, so I need two moves.\n> \n> Back to planning.\n> \n> Also, there is a danger with tail reward, but since tail is not near food yet, it might not be immediate issue.\n> \n> Now, another food at (4,5), which is one right and two up from (3,3), but I can't go right directly.\n> \n> I could go left or down first, but that might not be efficient.\n> \n> Let's list all possible actions for turn 0 and evaluate.\n> \n> Possible moves turn 0: U, D, L\n> \n> - Move U to (3,4): then from there, I can go to (3,5) on turn 1 to eat food.\n> \n> - Move D to (3,2): then I'm farther from food, might not be good.\n> \n> - Move L to (2,3): then I'm left, food is mostly up and right.\n> \n> (2,3) to (3,5) is not direct.\n> \n> (6,6) is far.\n> \n> So moving U seems best to go towards food quickly.\n> \n> But I need to think long-term.\n> \n> After eating (3,5), I have snake at [(3,5), (3,4)] with head at (3,5), and direction U (since I moved up to get there).\n> \n> Then I need to move to other food.\n> \n> Next food: (4,5) is adjacent to (3,5) to the right.\n> \n> (4,5) is at (4,5), which is east of (3,5).\n> \n> From (3,5), I can move R to (4,5) to eat that food immediately on turn 2, if I go that path.\n> \n> Sequence:\n> \n> Turn 0: move U to (3,4)  // no food\n> \n> Turn 1: move U to (3,5)  // eat food, now snake: head (3,5), tail (3,4)\n> \n> Direction: last move U, so direction U.\n> \n> Turn 2: from (3,5), I can move U, R, or L?

But in this case, when I eat, the tail is not adjacent in a way that causes issue.\n> \n> For example, when I eat at (3,5), tail is at (3,4), which is adjacent, but I'm eating at (3,5), head moves to (3,5), and tail is at (3,4), which is below, not on the same cell. Tail reward danger is when the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> But here, when I move to (3,5), tail is at (3,4), which is different cell. The food is at (3,5), not on tail.\n> \n> Tail reward danger: \"If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake\"\n> \n> The food must be on the tail cell.\n> \n> In this case, tail cell is (3,4), and there is no food there, so no danger.\n> \n> Similarly later.\n> \n> Now, but in my sequence, I go to (6,6), but there is another food at (6,6), but I have three foods all with life 10, so all can be eaten.\n> \n> But I need to consider if moving L or D first is better, but probably not, since food is up.\n> \n> Move D to (3,2) on turn 0: then I'm at (3,2), farther from all food.

This maximizes score with minimal risk by leveraging the snake's small initial size to navigate freely.\n",

There's an internal obstacle at (1,6). Snake is currently at position [(3,4)] with head direction Up. So the snake is only one segment long right now, meaning it's just the head. That's important because with only one segment, there's no body to collide with except itself, but since it's just the head, moving onto its own position might be an issue, but in this case, since it's moving, it should be fine as long as it doesn't hit a wall or something.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (4,5) with value 1, life span 9\n> \n> - (3,5) with value 1, life span 9\n> \n> - (6,6) with value 1, life span 9\n> \n> - (6,5) with value 1, life span 10\n> \n> All food has value 1 except (6,5) has life span 10, others have 9. But all are positive since value is 1.\n> \n> Current turn is t=1. I need to think 5+ turns ahead, prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> Since the snake is only one segment, eating any food will make it grow. When it eats food, it grows immediately, so after eating, the length increases, and the new segment is added, but movement happens, so when head moves to a food cell, it eats it, and the tail doesn't move that turn, so length increases.\n> \n> But in this case, since there's only head, if it eats food, the tail will be created, but initially no tail.\n> \n> Snake positions: [(3,4)] so head at (3,4), no body, so length 1.\n> \n> Head direction is Up, so moving up would go to (3,5).\n> \n> Possible moves from (3,4):\n> \n> - Up: to (3,5)\n> \n> - Down: to (3,3) but y=3 is within 0-7, but need to check walls.\n> \n> Walls: border x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.

When head moves to food, it eats, so head is at (3,5), and since it ate, a new segment is added, but where? Typically, the tail stays or grows.\n> \n> Standard snake: when you eat, the tail doesn't move that turn, so length increases.\n> \n> But here, since no tail, moving to food will create a body segment.\n> \n> After eating, positions: head at food cell, and previous position becomes body.

I need to consider other food and long-term survival.\n> \n> Since snake is short, growing is good, but I should avoid risks.\n> \n> Now, life span: all food has life span 9 or 10, current turn 1, so they disappear after turn 9 or 10? Life span decreases every turn, including current.\n> \n> Life span N, disappears after N turns, countdown decreases each turn.\n> \n> So for food at (3,5), life span 9, at turn 1, after this turn, if not eaten, life span becomes 8, and so on, until 0, it disappears.\n> \n> But since I can eat it now, life span doesn't matter for immediate.\n> \n> But for other food, if I don't eat now, it might disappear later.\n> \n> But all have high life span, 9 or 10, so plenty of time.\n> \n> Now, grid: 8x8, walls at borders, and obstacle at (1,6).\n> \n> I should plan a path to eat multiple food.\n> \n> First, let's list all possible moves from current position (3,4):\n> \n> - Up: (3,5) - has food, value 1\n> \n> - Left: (2,4) - no food mentioned, probably empty\n> \n> - Right: (4,4) - no food\n> \n> Down not allowed because reverse direction.\n> \n> If I move Up, I eat the food at (3,5), snake becomes length 2, positions [(3,5), (3,4)], head at (3,5), direction Up (since I moved Up).\n> \n> Then from there, I can move U, D, L, R, but cannot reverse to Down? Current head direction is Up, so if I move Down, it would be reverse.\n> \n> After moving to (3,5), head direction is Up.\n> \n> Then next moves: Up to (3,6), Down to (3,4) but (3,4) is the tail, which is about to move, but in snake movement, when you move, head goes to new position, and tail follows, so if I move Down to (3,4), which is the current tail position.\n> \n> But (3,4) is occupied by the body, but since the tail will move away, it might be safe, but need to check collision rules.\n> \n> Collision: body collision if head touches any body segment except the tail, because tail moves.\n> \n> The rules say: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So moving to the tail cell is safe because the tail moves, so head and tail swap or something.\n> \n> Specifically, when head moves to tail cell, since tail moves away, no collision.\n> \n> But in this case, after eating at (3,5), positions [(3,5), (3,4)], head at (3,5).\n> \n> If I move Down to (3,4), which is the tail position. Since tail will move, it should be safe; head moves to (3,4), and tail moves... but tail was at (3,4), and head moves there, so after move: head at (3,4), and since no eat, tail moves off, so body is just [(3,4)], but positions: after moving Down, head to (3,4), and the tail (which was at (3,4)) moves to... but when no eat, tail moves to the next segment, but here only two segments.\n> \n> Initial positions: [(3,5), (3,4)] head at (3,5), tail at (3,4).\n> \n> Move Down: head moves to (3,4). But (3,4) is occupied by tail. Since tail will move, head can move to (3,4), and tail moves to... there is no next segment; the tail was at (3,4), and since head moves to it, and no food eaten, the tail should be removed or something? I think I'm confusing.\n> \n> Standard snake movement:\n> \n> - When no food eaten: head moves to new cell, tail moves off the last cell, so the last cell is vacated.\n> \n> - When food eaten: head moves to food cell, tail does not move, so length increases by one.\n> \n> In this case, after eating at (3,5), positions: head (3,5), body (3,4).\n> \n> Now, if I move Down to (3,4), which is the body cell. Since I move to (3,4), and (3,4) has no food (food was only at (3,5), which we ate), so I don't eat, so head moves to (3,4), and tail moves off (3,4)? But tail is at (3,4), and head moves to same cell? That might be collision.\n> \n> The rule: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> But here, when head moves to the tail cell, since tail moves away at the same time, the cell is vacated by tail just as head enters, so no collision.\n> \n> After move, positions: head at (3,4), and since no eat, the tail segment is removed, so snake is [(3,4)] only, back to length 1? That can't be right.\n> \n> I think I have a mistake.\n> \n> Positions before move: segments: index 0: head (3,5), index 1: tail (3,4)\n> \n> Move Down: head moves to (3,4). Since (3,4) is the tail position, and no food there, so head moves to (3,4), and the tail is removed because it moved off? But in snake, when you move to a cell with no food, head moves to new cell, and tail is removed from its cell, so the new positions are: head at new position, and the body segments shift.\n> \n> Specifically, the new head is at (3,4), and the old head (3,5) becomes body, and the tail (3,4) is... but (3,4) is both the new head and old tail position.\n> \n> When head moves to (3,4), which is occupied by the tail, but since the tail is moving away (in the sense that it is no longer there after move), so head can occupy it.\n> \n> After move: the segment that was head at (3,5) is now body at (3,5)? No.\n> \n> Let's think of the list: positions list [head, body, ..., tail]\n> \n> Before move: [ (3,5), (3,4) ]\n> \n> Move Down: head moves to (3,4). The cell (3,4) was tail, so we are moving to tail cell.\n> \n> Since no food eaten, the tail is removed, and the head takes that position.\n> \n> So new positions: the body segment (3,5) is still there, but now it becomes the tail? The list shifts.\n> \n> After moving head to (3,4), the new head is (3,4), and the previous head (3,5) is now the tail, but (3,5) is a different cell.\n> \n> Positions: before move, index 0: (3,5) head, index 1: (3,4) tail.\n> \n> After moving head to (3,4): the new head is at (3,4), and since we moved to the cell that was tail, the tail is gone, but the body segment at (3,5) is still there? I think I'm messing up.\n> \n> Standard: the positions list is updated by adding the new head position and removing the tail position if no food eaten.\n> \n> So, if no food, new head position = move from current head, then new positions = [new_head] + old_positions[:-1]  or something.\n> \n> Typically: new_head = current_head + move\n> \n> Then if new_head has food, eat, so new_positions = [new_head] + old_positions  (length increases)\n> \n> Else, new_positions = [new_head] + old_positions[:-1]  (tail removed)\n> \n> In this case, before move: positions = [(3,5), (3,4)]  head (3,5), tail (3,4)\n> \n> Move Down to (3,4): new_head = (3,4)\n> \n> Now, (3,4) is the current tail position, and it has no food (since we ate the food at (3,5) earlier, and (3,4) has no food).\n> \n> So no eat, so new_positions = [new_head] + old_positions[:-1] = [(3,4)] + [(3,5)] but old_positions[:-1] is [(3,5)] since positions had two elements, [0] and [1], :-1 is [0], so [(3,5)].\n> \n> So new_positions = [(3,4)] + [(3,5)] = [(3,4), (3,5)]  so head at (3,4), tail at (3,5).\n> \n> So effectively, the snake reversed direction, and now head is at (3,4), tail at (3,5).\n> \n> And (3,4) was the previous tail, but now it's head, and (3,5) is new tail.\n> \n> No collision because when head moved to (3,4), the tail was there but moved away as part of the update.\n> \n> Similarly, in general, moving to tail cell is safe because the tail is removed.\n> \n> But in this case, for my immediate decision.\n> \n> Back to turn 1.\n> \n> At (3,4), head direction Up.\n> \n> Options: Up to (3,5) with food, or Left to (2,4), or Right to (4,4).\n> \n> If I go Up, I eat food at (3,5), snake grows to length 2, positions [(3,5), (3,4)], head direction Up.\n> \n> Then at turn 2, from (3,5), I can move U, D, L, R.\n> \n> But if I move D to (3,4), as above, it would be safe, but I go back to almost start, but with snake longer?

am safe.\n> \n> I could move to (5,6) at some point.\n> \n> Another idea: from (5,5) at turn 3, instead of moving to (6,5), I could move U to (5,6) at turn 4.\n> \n> Then from (5,6), I can move R to (6,6) eat at turn 5.\n> \n> But then at (6,6) with body, and I can move L to (5,6) but body, or D to (6,5) which has food, so eat at turn 5 or 6.\n> \n> Turn 4: from (5,5) move U to (5,6) no eat, positions: after turn 3 at (5,5) with [(5,5), (4,5), (3,5)]\n> \n> Move U to (5,6) no eat, new positions [(5,6), (5,5), (4,5)] tail (4,5)\n> \n> Turn 5: move R to (6,6) eat, positions [(6,6)] + [(5,6), (5,5), (4,5)] = [(6,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5)] length 4\n> \n> Then from (6,6), I can only move L to (5,6) but (5,6) is body, occupied, collision if I move there.\n> \n> Move D to (6,5) which has food, so at turn 6, move D to (6,5) eat.\n> \n> But turn 6 is beyond 5.\n> \n> In the sequence up to turn 5, I end at (6,6) with positions including (5,6) body, so only move is down to (6,5), but for turn 5 action, I moved to (6,6), so at end of turn 5, I am at (6,6) with body around.\n> \n> Then for turn 6, I must move D to (6,5) to eat and grow, or if I don't, but I can.\n> \n> But at turn 5, after move, I am in a position where only down is possible, which is risky if something, but I can do it.\n> \n> To have more flexibility, it's better to eat (6,5) first and not go to (6,6) immediately.\n> \n> So I think the first sequence with moving to (6,5) at turn 4 and (6,4) at turn 5 is better for survival.\n> \n> Then I can eat (6,6) later when I approach from below.\n> \n> But

Prioritized eating the high-value, short-range food at (3,5) and (4,5) immediately to grow the snake for increased survivability, then moved toward the distant food at (6,5) while avoiding the corner

My goal is to maximize score by eating positive food while avoiding risks. I need to think at least 5 turns ahead and prioritize long-term survival over immediate rewards.\n> \n> Current state:\n> \n> - Turn: 2\n> \n> - Walls: Border cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (1,6). So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are at the borders and (1,6) is blocked.\n> \n> - Snake positions: Head at (3,5), body at (3,4). So the snake is only 2 segments long, moving Up. Head direction is U, which is up, so from (3,5) to (3,4) is down? Let me clarify.\n> \n> Snake positions: [(3,5), (3,4)]. Head is first, so head is at (3,5), and tail is at (3,4). Head direction is U, meaning it's moving upwards. But from (3,5) to (3,4), that would be moving down if y increases upwards? I need to define the coordinate system.\n> \n> Typically in grids, y=0 is bottom or top? The movement: U is (x,y+1), which might imply y increases upwards. But let's see the positions: head at (3,5), body at (3,4). Since head is at higher y, and moving U to (x,y+1), that means y=5 is above y=4? So if U is (x,y+1), then increasing y is up, so (3,5) is above (3,4). So moving U from (3,5) would go to (3,6), but current position is (3,5), and body is (3,4), so it was moving down to get to (3,5) from previous? Head direction is U, but positions show head at (3,5) and body at (3,4), so if y increases up, (3,5) is above (3,4), so to have body at (3,4), that means the snake was moving down to reach (3,5)? I'm confused.\n> \n> Perhaps the head direction is the current direction it's facing, but the position might be from the previous move. Head direction is given as U, meaning it's currently moving upwards. So from turn 1 to turn 2, it moved to (3,5) from some previous position, but we don't have that. The positions are current: head at (3,5), tail at (3,4), and head direction U, so it must have come from below, meaning from (3,4) to (3,5) by moving up? But (3,4) is the tail, so at turn 2, head is at (3,5), and it was at (3,4) at turn 1? Let's think.\n> \n> At turn 2, positions: [(3,5), (3,4)] with head direction U. That means at turn 1, head was at some position, and it moved U to (3,5), and the tail was at (3,4) or something. Since it's a snake of length 2, at turn 1, it might have been at [(3,4), something], but we don't have history. For current state, head is at (3,5), and it can move U, D, L, R from there.\n> \n> Head direction U means it's facing up, so it can move U, L, or R, but not D instantly because of no instant reverse. Rule: \"No instant reverse\": Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn. So current direction is U, so I cannot move D (down) on this turn. Possible moves: U, L, R.\n> \n> Now, food positions:\n> \n> - (4,5) with value 1, life span 8\n> \n> - (6,6) with value 1, life span 8\n> \n> - (6,5) with value 1, life span 9\n> \n> All food has value 1, so all positive food? Value is given as 1 for all, and it says \"Value and Life Span\", so (x,y, life_span, value) I think. Let's read:\n> \n> Food: (4,5,8,1) — that's (x,y, life_span, value)\n> \n> Similarly, (6,6,8,1) and (6,5,9,1)\n> \n> So all have value 1, so all are positive food. No negative food here.\n> \n> Life span: for (4,5) is 8, (6,6) is 8, (6,5) is 9. Since current turn is 2, and life span decreases every turn including current, so after turn 2, life span will be 7 for (4,5) and (6,6), and 8 for (6,5)? Life span decreases every turn, starting from current turn.\n> \n> Rule: \"Life-span disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So at turn t, when food is present, its life span is given, and it decreases each turn. So for food at turn 2:\n> \n> - (4,5): life span 8, so it will disappear after 8 more turns? \"after N turns\" meaning it has N turns left including current.\n> \n> Let's read: \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So if at turn t, life span is N, it means it will disappear after turn t + N - 1 or something? I need to clarify.\n> \n> Typically, if life span is N at turn t, it decreases by 1 each turn, so at turn t, countdown is N, at turn t+1 it is N-1, ..., at turn t + N -1 it is 1, and at turn t + N it disappears. But since it decreases including current turn, at the start of turn t, life span is N, and during turn t, it can be eaten; if not, at turn t+1, life span is N-1, etc.\n> \n> But for simplicity, since we act on each turn, we can think that at the beginning of turn, life span is given, and after the turn, if not eaten, it decreases.\n> \n> In this case, turn 2, life span 8 for (4,5) means it has 8 turns left, including turn 2. So it can be eaten from turn 2 to turn 9, disappearing at turn 10 or something. But for planning, we just know how many turns it has left.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,6) life span 8, (6,5) life span 9.\n> \n> Now, grid size: walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so playable area from (1,1) to (6,6)? x from 0 to 7, but x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x from 1 to 6, similarly y from 1 to 6? y=0 and y=7 walls, so y from 1 to 6? Let's see coordinates.\n> \n> x=0 to 7, but x=0 and x=7 are walls, so valid x: 1,2,3,4,5,6\n> \n> y=0 to 7, y=0 and y=7 walls, so valid y: 1,2,3,4,5,6\n> \n> Also, internal obstacle at (1,6), so that cell is blocked.\n> \n> So playable cells: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except (1,6) is obstacle.\n> \n> Now snake: head at (3,5), tail at (3,4), both in playable area.\n> \n> Food: (4,5) which is right next to head, to the right (east), since x increases right, y up.\n> \n> (4,5) is adjacent to (3,5) in the right direction? (3,5) to (4,5) is east.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,6) is far, (6,5) also.\n> \n> Current possible moves from (3,5): U, D, L, R, but cannot move D because of no reverse; current direction U, so cannot move down.\n> \n> Possible: U (up to (3,6)), L (left to (2,5)), R (right to (4,5))\n> \n> D is down to (3,4), but (3,4) is the tail, but since tail will move, it might be safe, but no instant reverse, so cannot move D.\n> \n> Rule: \"Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\" — so since current direction is U, I cannot choose D for the next move.\n> \n> So only U, L, R are possible.\n> \n> Now, let's list the options:\n> \n> - Move U to (3,6): what is (3,6)? Is it valid? y=6, which is within 1 to 6, and not wall, not obstacle. (1,6) is obstacle, but (3,6) is different. x=3,y=6, should be ok. But y=6 is the top row, since y=7 wall, so y=6 is playable.\n> \n> - Move L to (2,5): x=2,y=5, should be ok.\n> \n> - Move R to (4,5): but (4,5) has food! So moving R would eat the food at (4,5).\n> \n> But I need to think multiple steps ahead.\n> \n> Also, there is a special case: Tail Reward Danger. If head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake.\n> \n> Here, head at (3,5), tail at (3,4). Are they adjacent? Yes, vertically, since (3,5) and (3,4) differ only in y.\n> \n> But the food is not on the tail; the food is at (4,5), which is not the tail. Tail is at (3,4), no food there.\n> \n> So moving to (4,5) would eat the food, since it's positive, snake grows to length 3.\n> \n> After eating, positions: head moves to (4,5), and the tail stays or what? When you eat, the tail doesn't move, so new positions: head at (4,5), then the previous head (3,5) becomes body, and tail (3,4) still tail, so snake becomes [(4,5), (3,5), (3,4)].\n> \n> Then next turn, when moving, the tail moves away.\n> \n> But for now, eating at (4,5) seems good, but let's see the life span: it has life span 8, so plenty of time, but it's close, so I could eat it now.\n> \n> But I need to consider other food and long-term.\n> \n> Other food: (6,6) and (6,5), both with high life span.\n> \n> But (4,5) is very close.\n> \n> Now, thinking 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> First, let's sketch the grid:\n> \n> Grid rows y=1 to 6, columns x=1 to 6.\n> \n> Walls: borders x=1 to 6, y=1 to6 except (1,6) obstacle.\n> \n> So cells:\n> \n> Let me list for clarity:\n> \n> y=6: x=1 to6, but (1,6) is wall/obstacle, so (1,6) blocked.\n> \n> Similarly, x=1: y=1 to6, but (1,6) blocked, so (1,1) to (1,5) ok? x=1, y=1 to6, but (1,6) is specifically blocked, so (1,1) to (1,5) are free, (1,6) blocked.\n> \n> Similarly, other borders are walls, so no issue.\n> \n> Internal obstacle only (1,6).\n> \n> Now snake: head (3,5), tail (3,4)\n> \n> Food: (4,5) at east, (6,6) northeast, (6,5) east.\n> \n> (6,5) is at x=6,y=5, (6,6) at x=6,y=6.\n> \n> Current turn t=2.\n> \n> I need to choose action for turn 2.\n> \n> Options:\n> \n> 1. Move R to (4,5): eat food, snake grows to length 3. New head position (4,5), head direction R (since moved right). Then positions: [(4,5), (3,5), (3,4)]\n> \n> After this, on turn 3, head at (4,5), can move U, D, L, R, but cannot move L (opposite of R) if direction is R.\n> \n> After moving R, new direction is R, so for next turn, cannot move L (left).\n> \n> 2. Move U to (3,6): head to (3,6), no food there. Snake doesn't grow, so positions: head to (3,6), tail moves to (3,5)? When no eat, snake moves, head to new position, tail removed, so new positions: [(3,6), (3,5)] since length 2.\n> \n> Then head direction U.\n> \n> 3. Move L to (2,5): head to (2,5), no food, positions [(2,5), (3,5)]? Head moves to (2,5), previous head (3,5) becomes body, tail (3,4) is removed since no growth.

I'm confused.\n> \n> Let's assume that \"after N turns\" means it is present for N turns starting from now.\n> \n> For example, at turn t, with life_span L, it can be eaten on turns t, t+1, ..., t+L-1, and disappears at turn t+L.\n> \n> Similarly, countdown: at turn t, countdown = L, after turn t, countdown = L-1 for turn t+1, ..., at turn t+L-1, countdown=1, after eaten or not, at turn t+L, it disappears.\n> \n> In the state, for (6,6) at turn 3, life_span=7, so countdown=7, meaning it has 7 turns left including turn 3. So it will disappear after turn 9 (since 3 to 9 is 7 turns: turn 3,4,5,6,7,8,9, disappear at start of turn 10 or after turn 9?).\n> \n> \"Disappears after N turns\" – after N turns from now.\n> \n> So from turn 3, after 7 turns, it disappears at turn 10.\n> \n> Similarly for (6,5), life_span=8 at turn 3, disappears after 8 turns, at turn 11.\n> \n> But for planning, I need to know when they expire.\n> \n> Since both have high life, they will be around for a while.\n> \n> Now, back to moves.\n> \n> I need to eat food but avoid risks.\n> \n> First, possible actions at turn 3 (current turn).\n> \n> From (4,5), direction R, so can go U, D, or R.\n> \n> - U to (4,6)\n> \n> - D to (4,4)\n> \n> - R to (5,5)\n> \n> Now, what about the food? (6,5) is at (6,5), which is two steps right: (5,5) then (6,5).\n> \n> (6,6) is at (6,6), which could be reached via (5,5) then (6,5) or (5,6), etc.\n> \n> But I have to consider the snake body.\n> \n> Current snake: positions (4,5), (3,5), (3,4)\n> \n> If I move right to (5,5), then the body will move to (4,5), and tail to (3,5)?

So new snake: [(5,5), (4,5), (3,5)]\n> \n> The cell (3,4) is now empty, since tail moved.\n> \n> Similarly, if I move U to (4,6), new snake: [(4,6), (4,5), (3,5)] and tail (3,4) moves to (3,5)? Positions: head to (4,6), then the first body segment (which was at (3,5)) moves to (4,5), and the tail (which was at (3,4)) moves to (3,5).

Adjacent cells would be (4,5) and (4,4), (4,6), (3,5), (5,5).\n> \n> (3,5) is the body, not tail.

Let's think.\n> \n> Standard snake movement:\n> \n> - When moving without eating: head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, tail moves away from its position.\n> \n> - When eating: head moves to food cell, a new segment is added at the tail position, so the tail doesn't move; the snake grows by one, so the positions are: new head, then all previous segments, with tail unchanged but now part of longer body.\n> \n> For example, here: before move, positions: [ (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5) ]\n> \n> If move to (6,6) and eat, new positions: head (6,6), then (6,5) (which was head), then (5,5), then (4,5), then tail (3,5) — but since we ate, we add a new segment at the tail, so the tail was at (3,5), it stays, and a new segment is added there? No.\n> \n> I think I'm confusing.\n> \n> Typically, when snake eats, the tail doesn't move; the new head position is set, and the body includes all previous positions plus the new head, so the tail remains where it was, but the snake is longer.\n> \n> Positions after eating: new head at food cell, then the previous head, then the previous body segments, and the tail remains.

It's turn 6. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and an internal obstacle at (1,6). So, the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls block those cells.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (6,6), then body segments at (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5). So the snake is 5 units long. Head direction is Up, meaning it was moving upwards to reach (6,6) from (6,5) last turn.\n> \n> Food: only one food item at (2,2) with value 1 and life span 8. Since it's turn 6, and life span decreases every turn including current, so after turn 6, life span becomes 7, then 6, and so on, until it disappears after turn 13 (since 6 + 8 - 1 = 13? Let's calculate: life span starts at 8 on turn 6. After turn 6, it becomes 7; after turn 7, it becomes 6; ... after turn 13, it becomes 0, so it disappears after turn 13, meaning it can be eaten from turn 6 to turn 13 inclusive? Life span decreases every turn, including current. So on turn 6, life span is 8. After turn 6, it becomes 7. It can be eaten as long as life span > 0, I assume. So from turn 6 to turn 13, since on turn 13, life span is 1, after eating or after turn, it decreases? The food can be eaten when head moves onto it, and at that time, life span must be >0. Then after eaten, it's gone. But if not eaten, after N turns it disappears. Here, life span 8 on turn 6, so it will disappear after turn 13 if not eaten. On turn 13, if head moves to (2,2) before life span decrease, it can be eaten, but since life span decreases at the end of turn, I think.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Life-span disappears after N turns\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So for food with life span N at turn t, it will be present until turn t + N - 1, and disappear at the start of turn t + N or something? Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" – so at turn t, countdown is N. After turn t, it becomes N-1. After turn t+1, it becomes N-2, and so on, until it reaches 0, and when it becomes 0, it disappears, meaning it cannot be eaten after that. So for food at (2,2) with life span 8 on turn 6:\n> \n> - Turn 6: life span 8\n> \n> - After turn 6: life span 7\n> \n> - After turn 7: life span 6\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - After turn 12: life span 1\n> \n> - After turn 13: life span 0, disappears\n> \n> So it can be eaten during turns 6 to 13 inclusive, since on turn 13, before life span decrease, it's still 1, so can be eaten if head moves there on turn 13. After turn 13, it's gone.\n> \n> Now, snake head is at (6,6), direction Up. Possible moves: U, D, L, R. But cannot move opposite to current direction. Current direction is U, so opposite is D. So cannot move Down next turn. Also, need to avoid walls and body collision except tail.\n> \n> Walls: borders, so x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Also internal obstacle at (1,6), so (1,6) is blocked.\n> \n> Snake body: head (6,6), body (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5). So the tail is at (3,5).\n> \n> Now, adjacent cells to head (6,6):\n> \n> - Up: (6,7) – but y=7 is border wall, so cannot move there.\n> \n> - Down: (6,5) – but (6,5) is occupied by the body, specifically the second segment. But is it safe? Since the tail will move, but let's see: if snake moves down to (6,5), that cell is currently occupied by the body, but when head moves there, the tail will also move forward, so after move, the body segment at (6,5) will be the new head, and the tail at (3,5) will be removed? No.\n> \n> Standard snake mechanics: when snake moves, head goes to new position, each body segment moves to the previous position of the next segment. If it eats food, a new segment is added at the tail, so length increases.\n> \n> But here, if head moves to a cell occupied by the body, it's collision, except if it's the tail cell and the tail moves away.\n> \n> Rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, moving to a cell that will be vacated by the tail is safe, because tail moves away.\n> \n> In this case, possible moves from (6,6):\n> \n> - Up: (6,7) - wall, invalid\n> \n> - Down: (6,5) - currently occupied by the second segment. Is this the tail? Tail is at (3,5), so (6,5) is not the tail; it's a body segment. So moving to (6,5) would cause collision with body, since head touches the segment there.\n> \n> - Left: (5,6) - what is here? Currently, no snake body or wall? Let's list all occupied cells.\n> \n> Snake positions: (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5)\n> \n> Walls: all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and (1,6)\n> \n> So (5,6): x=5, y=6. Walls: not border, not (1,6), so should be free? Internal obstacles only (1,6), so (5,6) is empty.\n> \n> - Right: (7,6) - x=7 is border wall, so invalid.\n> \n> So possible moves: Left to (5,6) or Down to (6,5), but Down to (6,5) is occupied by body, not tail, so collision. Therefore, only possible move is Left to (5,6).\n> \n> But current direction is Up, and we're moving Left, which is not opposite, so allowed.\n> \n> Opposite of Up is Down, Left is perpendicular, so fine.\n> \n> So on this turn, turn 6, I must move Left to (5,6).\n> \n> But I need to think ahead 5+ turns.\n> \n> First, let's confirm the move for turn 6.\n> \n> Action for turn 6: L (to (5,6))\n> \n> Now, after move, snake positions: head moves to (5,6), then the body: the segment that was at (6,6) becomes the new position for the first body segment?

Borders are x=0,7 and y=0,7, so cells from (1,1) to (6,6) are inside, but x=0,7 and y=0,7 are walls, so valid cells are (1,1) to (6,6)? Let's confirm.\n> \n> x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, since x=0,7 and y=0,7 are walls. Also internal obstacle at (1,6), so (1,6) is wall.\n> \n> So free cells: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, except (1,6) is wall.\n> \n> So (1,6) blocked, but (1,1) to (1,5) should be free? x=1,y=1 to5, and x=2 to6, y=1 to6 except (1,6).\n> \n> y from 1 to 6, since y=0 and y=7 walls.\n> \n> Similarly x.\n> \n> So (2,2) is within bounds.\n> \n> Now, from head at (4,6) on turn 8.\n> \n> If I move Left to (3,6), then I'm closer to x=2.\n> \n> From (3,6), I can then move Left to (2,6), then from (2,6) I can move Down to (2,5), (2,4), etc. to (2,2).\n> \n> (2,6) to (2,2) is clear, no obstacles.\n> \n> If I move Down to (4,5) on turn 8, then from (4,5) I can move Left to (3,5), but (3,5) might be occupied? Not now, but let's see.\n> \n> On turn 8, if I move to (4,5), then positions change.\n> \n> But I need to think multiple steps.\n> \n> Also, the snake body might be in the way later.\n> \n> Moreover, there is a risk with the tail if I eat food when head is adjacent to tail.\n> \n> But for now, no food nearby.\n> \n> First, let's plan a path to (2,2).\n> \n> Minimum steps to (2,2) from (4,6): |4-2| + |6-2| = 2 + 4 = 6 steps, but since snake moves one per turn, at least 6 turns from now.\n> \n> Current turn is 6, after turn 6 move, it's turn 7 start, but we plan actions for future turns.\n> \n> Let's define the turns.\n> \n> At start of turn 6: head at (6,6), we move to (5,6)\n> \n> End of turn 6: positions [ (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5) ], food life span 7 (after decrease)\n> \n> Start of turn 7: head at (5,6), we must move to (4,6) as only choice?

After turn12, life span decreases to 0?

Currently, on turn 8 start, positions have (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), so (2,6) is free. Similarly, (2,5), (2,4), etc. should be free, no obstacles.\n> \n> But what about the body? As I move, the body follows, so the tail moves, and positions change, but since I'm going to a new area, it should be fine.\n> \n> Now, another option: on turn 8, move down to (4,5)\n> \n> Then positions: after move to (4,5), new head (4,5), body: seg1 to (4,6), seg2 to (5,6), seg3 to (6,6), seg4 to (6,5), tail to (5,5)? Let's update.\n> \n> Start turn 8 positions: [ (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (5,5) ]\n> \n> Move Down to (4,5): new head (4,5)\n> \n> New seg1: old head (4,6)\n> \n> New seg2: old seg1 (5,6)\n> \n> New seg3: old seg2 (6,6)\n> \n> New seg4: old seg3 (6,5)\n> \n> Old seg4 at (5,5) removed.\n> \n> New positions: [ (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5) ]\n> \n> Tail at (6,5)\n> \n> Now head at (4,5), direction D (since moved down).\n> \n> Then turn 9: from (4,5), possible moves.\n> \n> - U: (4,6) - occupied by seg1, body, so collision if move there?

So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7). There's also an internal obstacle at (1,6).\n> \n> - Snake positions: Head is at (5,6), then body segments at (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5). So the snake has 5 segments. Head direction is left (L), meaning it was moving left to (5,6) from (6,6) I think? Positions are given as [(5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5)]. Since head is first, and direction is L, that means the head moved left from (6,6) to (5,6) in the previous turn.

Internal obstacle at (1,6).\n> \n> Snake positions:\n> - Head: (5,6)\n> - Body: (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5)\n> \n> So, let's plot this:\n> \n> Row y=7: top\n> y=6: cells from x=0 to x=7. At x=5: head (5,6). x=6: body (6,6). Also, internal wall at (1,6), so (1,6) is blocked.\n> \n> (1,6) is an internal obstacle, so not accessible.\n> \n> y=5: (6,5) body, (5,5) body, (4,5) body.\n> \n> Food at (2,2) and (2,1).\n> \n> (2,1) is at x=2,y=1; (2,2) is x=2,y=2.\n> \n> Current head direction is L, meaning it's facing left.

Rule: cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\n> \n> Current direction is L, so opposite is R. So I cannot move right on this turn. Possible moves: L (left to (4,6)), U (up to (5,7)), or D (down to (5,5)).\n> \n> But (5,5) is occupied by the body! Snake positions include (5,5), which is the fourth segment. Let's see the list: [(5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5)]\n> \n> So (5,5) is a body segment.

(4,6) is not occupied by body or wall? Let's see.\n> \n> (4,6): not in snake positions: snake has (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5). So (4,6) is empty. Walls: x=4,y=6, not border or obstacle. Border walls are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. (4,6) is within bounds. Internal obstacle (1,6), not (4,6). So (4,6) is free.\n> \n> - Move U to (5,7): but y=7 is border wall, so collision, death.\n> \n> - Move D to (5,5): but (5,5) is occupied by body segment, so collision, death.\n> \n> - Move R to (6,6): but (6,6) is the first body segment, and also, instant reverse not allowed since current direction is L, opposite is R, so cannot move right anyway.\n> \n> So, only possible move is L to (4,6). Is that right?\n> \n> But let's confirm: possible actions: U, D, L, R.\n> \n> U: (5,7) - wall, invalid.\n> \n> D: (5,5) - body, invalid.\n> \n> R: (6,6) - body and also instant reverse, invalid.\n> \n> L: (4,6) - seems free.\n> \n> But is (4,6) free? Snake positions: (4,5) is tail, but (4,6) is different cell. No body at (4,6). Walls: not wall. So yes, only L is possible?\n> \n> But that seems like I have no choice but to move left to (4,6). But let's think about the tail.\n> \n> When the snake moves, the head moves to a new position, and the tail moves forward, so the cell that was tail might become free.\n> \n> But for this immediate move, I need to check if the target cell is safe to move into now.\n> \n> (4,6) is currently unoccupied, so moving there should be fine. After move, the snake will have new positions: head at (4,6), then body: (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), and tail (4,5) will move? Let's see.\n> \n> Current snake: positions: index 0: head (5,6), 1: (6,6), 2: (6,5), 3: (5,5), 4: (4,5) tail.\n> \n> After moving left to (4,6): new head is (4,6). Then the body segments follow: the previous head (5,6) becomes the first body segment, so new positions: head (4,6), then (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (5,5). The tail (4,5) is removed because we didn't eat food, so length unchanged. Since we're not eating food, the tail moves away from (4,5), so (4,5) becomes empty.\n> \n> In this case, moving to (4,6) is safe.\n> \n> But is there food at (4,6)? Food is at (2,2) and (2,1), not (4,6), so no food eaten.\n> \n> Now, but I need to plan multiple turns.\n> \n> Also, food life spans: at turn 7, food at (2,2) has life span 7, meaning it will disappear after 7 turns, but since it decreases each turn including current, at turn 7, life span 7, so it will decrease to 6 on turn 8, and so on, until it reaches 0 and disappears. Similarly, (2,1) life span 10, so it has more time.\n> \n> Life span decreases every turn, so at turn t, if life span is N, it will be present for N more turns, including turn t, so it disappears after turn t+N-1? Let's clarify.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So, at a given turn, if life_span is L, it means after this turn, it will have L-1 left, and it disappears when countdown reaches 0.\n> \n> For example, at turn 7, (2,2) has life_span 7, so after turn 7, it has 6 left; after turn 8, 5 left, ..., after turn 13, it has 0 left, so it disappears before turn 14? Let's think carefully.\n> \n> Typically, \"disappears after N turns\" might mean it is present for N turns starting from now.\n> \n> But the rule says: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so at turn t, when we have life_span L, it decreases to L-1 at the end of turn t, and when it reaches 0, it disappears.\n> \n> Standard way: at the beginning of turn, if life_span >0, it is present; after the turn, life_span decreases by 1.\n> \n> So at turn 7, life_span=7 for (2,2), so it is present; after turn 7, life_span becomes 6.\n> \n> Similarly, it will be present until the turn when life_span becomes 0, after which it disappears.\n> \n> For (2,2), life_span=7 at turn 7, so:\n> \n> - Turn 7: present, life_span=7\n> \n> - After turn 7: life_span=6\n> \n> - Turn 8: present, life_span=6\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - Turn 13: present, life_span=1 (after turn 13, it becomes 0)\n> \n> - After turn 13, life_span=0, so not present on turn 14.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,1) life_span=10 at turn 7, so it will be present until after turn 16, disappearing before turn 17.\n> \n> Now, back to the snake. At turn 7, I must move, and only possible move is L to (4,6), as we saw.\n> \n> But let's confirm if there are other options. What about moving down? (5,5) is body, but when I move, the tail moves, so if (5,5) is not the tail, it might still be occupied.\n> \n> In this case, (5,5) is the third segment, not tail. Tail is (4,5). When I move to a new cell, the head moves, and the tail is removed if no food eaten. So the cell (5,5) will still be occupied by the body after move, unless it was the tail.\n> \n> Specifically, after moving to (4,6), the new body will have (5,6) which was head, now first body, then (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), and tail (4,5) is removed? No.\n> \n> Current positions: [head: (5,6), seg1: (6,6), seg2: (6,5), seg3: (5,5), seg4/tail: (4,5)]\n> \n> After moving head to (4,6), new positions: head: (4,6), then the previous head becomes body, so [ (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (5,5) ] and the tail (4,5) is removed because no food eaten, so length remains 5. So the cell (4,5) is now free, but (5,5) is still occupied as body segment.\n> \n> Therefore, if I try to move down to (5,5) at turn 7, (5,5) is currently occupied by body, and after move, it would be even worse, but since it's not the tail, moving into (5,5) would cause collision with body.\n> \n> Similarly, up to (5,7) is wall.\n> \n> Right to (6,6) is body and also reverse not allowed.\n> \n> So indeed, only left to (4,6) is possible.\n> \n> So for turn 7, I must move L.\n> \n> Now, after that, head at (4,6), direction L? After moving left, the new head direction is left, so for next turn, direction is L.\n> \n> Now, turn 8.\n> \n> Head at (4,6), direction L.\n> \n> Possible moves: L to (3,6), U to (4,7), D to (4,5).\n> \n> (4,7): y=7 is wall, so invalid.\n> \n> (4,5): what is at (4,5)?

Wait, no: walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the grid is 7x7? Let's clarify: x=0 and x=7 are walls, meaning x from 0 to 7 inclusive, so cells from x=1 to x=6 are playable? Similarly for y.\n> \n> Walls: border cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So, for example, x=0 is a wall column, x=7 is a wall column, y=0 and y=7 are wall rows. But since it's a grid, the cells (0,y) for y=0 to 7 are walls, and (7,y) for y=0 to 7, similarly (x,0) and (x,7) for x=0 to 7. But the playable area should be x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, I think. Let's confirm with the snake positions.\n> \n> Snake positions: [(4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (5,5)]. So (4,6) is head, (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (5,5) is tail. Now, y=6 is one below y=7, which is a wall, so y=6 is playable, but y=7 is wall. Similarly, x=6 is playable, x=7 wall. Also, internal obstacle at (1,6).\n> \n> Food: (2,2) with life span 6, value 1; and (2,1) with life span 9, value 1. Both positive food since value=1.\n> \n> Current turn: t=8.\n> \n> Snake head direction: L, which is left, since positions: head at (4,6), then (5,6) which is to the right of head? Head is (4,6), next is (5,6), which has higher x, so if head is moving left, from where? Previous position must have been to the right. Since direction is L, current movement is left, so from (5,6) to (4,6)? Positions are given head first: [(4,6), (5,6), ...] so head is at (4,6), and the segment behind is (5,6), which means the snake was moving left to reach (4,6) from (5,6)? Let's think.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (4,6), then body: (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (5,5). Since head is at (4,6) and direction is L (left), that means it just moved to (4,6) from (5,6) by going left. So current head position is (4,6), facing left.\n> \n> Now, possible moves: I can go U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), L (left, x-1), R (right, x+1). But no instant reverse, so since I'm moving left, I cannot go right immediately. So forbidden move is R.\n> \n> So possible actions: U, D, L.\n> \n> Now, grid: let's sketch this.\n> \n> Grid size: walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so playable area x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (1,6).\n> \n> Food at (2,2) and (2,1).\n> \n> Snake: head (4,6), body (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (5,5). So let's list cells:\n> \n> - (4,6): head\n> \n> - (5,6): body\n> \n> - (6,6): body\n> \n> - (6,5): body\n> \n> - (5,5): tail\n> \n> Now, (5,5) is tail, and next move, when snake moves, tail will move forward, so the cell (5,5) will be vacated if no growth.\n> \n> Food life spans: (2,2) life span 6, so disappears after 6 turns, including current turn? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn t=8, it has life span 6, meaning it will disappear after turn t=8+6-1? Let's clarify life span.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So for food with life span N at turn t, it disappears at the end of turn t + N - 1? Example: if life span is 1 at turn t, it disappears after that turn, so only available on turn t.\n> \n> If life span N at turn t, countdown starts at N, decreases each turn. After N decreases, when countdown reaches 0, it disappears.\n> \n> \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" so at turn t, countdown is N, after turn t, it becomes N-1, and so on, until countdown 0, then disappears.\n> \n> So for (2,2): life span 6 at turn 8, so countdown=6. After turn 8, countdown=5; after turn 9, countdown=4; ... after turn 13, countdown=0, so disappears at the end of turn 13? After the turn when countdown reaches 0, it disappears.\n> \n> Typically, at the start of turn t, food is present if countdown >0. After the turn, countdown decreases.\n> \n> But for eating, during the turn, when head moves to food cell.\n> \n> For (2,2): at turn 8, life span=6, so it will be available for turns 8,9,10,11,12,13 (since countdown from 6 to 1), and after turn 13, countdown=0, gone. So available until turn 13 inclusive if we think of turns.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,1) life span=9, available from turn 8 to 16 inclusive? Countdown=9 at turn 8, after turn 8:8, turn9:7, ..., turn16:1, after turn16:0, gone. So available turns 8 to 16.\n> \n> But we need to plan actions.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead, maximize score, avoid risks.\n> \n> Current snake length: 5 segments, so eating positive food increases length by 1, negative decreases but here all food is positive, value=1, so no negative food in this state.\n> \n> Both foods are value 1, so positive.\n> \n> But I need to consider Tail Reward Danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it kills because after eating, tail grows and head collides with new tail.\n> \n> In this case, tail is at (5,5), which has no food, I think.

When snake moves without eating, tail moves forward, so positions: new head (4,5), then previous head (4,6) becomes body, so (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), and tail (5,5) is removed?

Thinking Conclusion\n> I prioritized moving down (D) on turn 8 to avoid the risky top-edge path near the obstacle (1,6) and maintain central flexibility, then executed a left-and-down sequence to

        "thinking": "Based on the detailed analysis provided by the previous thinking model, the immediate action for the current turn (Turn 9) is to move left (L) to position (3,5). This sets the snake on a path to efficiently reach and consume the positive food at (2,2) before it expires, while also positioning itself to potentially consume the food at (2,1) in subsequent turns.\n\n\\boxed{L}",
        "state": "**Current Turn**: \\( t_0 = 9 \\)\n**Cells occupied by walls**:\n\t - Border Cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7.\n\t - Internal Obstacles: [(1, 6)]\n**Snake Positions**:[(4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 6), (6, 5)]\n**Snake Head Direction**: D\n**Food Positions, Life Span and Value**:\n\t- (2, 2, 5, 1)\n\t- (2, 1, 8, 1)\n> **Guidance from a Previous Thinking Model:** Turn \\( t_1 = 9 \\)\n> <think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 9. The grid has borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7). There's an internal obstacle at (1,6).\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (4,5), then body segments at (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5). So the snake has 5 segments. Head direction is down, which is D. Since it's moving down, the previous move was down, so I can't instantly reverse to up on the next turn.\n> \n> Food: There are two positive foods, both with value +1 and life span given. Food at (2,2) with life span 5, and food at (2,1) with life span 8. Since it's turn 9, and life span decreases every turn including current, I need to calculate how many turns left for each food.\n> \n> For (2,2): life span 5, so it will disappear after turn 9 + 5 - 1? Life span decreases every turn, starting from the current turn. So at turn t, food with life span N will disappear after N turns, meaning it's available for N turns including the current one if it's present.\n> \n> The food is given at turn 9 with life span 5, so it was spawned at some turn, but the life span is the remaining life at turn 9. So for (2,2), life span 5 means it will disappear after 5 more turns, so after turn 13 (since turn 9 is the first, turn 10,11,12,13, gone after turn 13). Similarly, (2,1) with life span 8 will disappear after turn 16 (turns 9 to 16, 8 turns).\n> \n> Life span N at turn t means it can be eaten from turn t to turn t + N - 1, and disappears at the start of turn t + N. But for simplicity, I can think of the number of turns it remains: for (2,2), 5 turns including turn 9, so last chance to eat is turn 13. For (2,1), 8 turns, last chance turn 16.\n> \n> Now, snake head is at (4,5), direction down. So possible moves: since direction is down, I can move down, left, or right, but not up (instant reverse).\n> \n> Current position: head (4,5), body: (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5). So the tail is at (6,5).\n> \n> Possible moves from (4,5):\n> \n> - Down: to (4,4) - is this safe? Check walls: y=0 to y=7, so (4,4) is within bounds. Obstacles: only (1,6), not (4,4). Snake body: positions are (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5). (4,4) is not occupied, so safe for now.\n> \n> - Left: to (3,5) - within bounds, no obstacle, not occupied by body, safe.\n> \n> - Right: to (5,5) - similarly, within bounds, no obstacle, not occupied. Body has (5,6) and (6,5), but (5,5) is empty.\n> \n> - Up: to (4,6) - but (4,6) is the first body segment, so moving there would cause collision with body. Also, since head direction is down, moving up is instant reverse, which is not allowed. So up is invalid.\n> \n> So possible actions: D, L, R.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score, prioritizing long-term survival.\n> \n> Food is at (2,2) and (2,1), both positive. (2,1) is above (2,2), since y=1 is above y=2 if y increases upwards? Let's confirm coordinates.\n> \n> The movement: U is (x,y+1), so y increases upwards? Typically in grids, y=0 is bottom or top? The problem says U(x,y+1), D(x,y-1), so y increases as we go up. So (x,y) with U increasing y.\n> \n> For example, from (4,5), U to (4,6), D to (4,4), L to (3,5), R to (5,5).\n> \n> Food at (2,2) and (2,1). Since y=1 is less than y=2, (2,1) is below (2,2) because D decreases y, so lower y is down.\n> \n> y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top? Walls: y=0 and y=7 are borders, so y=0 is the bottom row, y=7 is the top row. U increases y, so from lower y to higher y is up.\n> \n> So (2,1) is at y=1, which is one above bottom, and (2,2) is at y=2, one above that. So (2,1) is below (2,2).\n> \n> Both foods are at x=2, y=1 and y=2.\n> \n> Snake head at (4,5), which is right and up from the foods. (4,5) to (2,2) is left 2, down 3? x from 4 to 2 is left 2, y from 5 to 2 is down 3 (since y decreases down).\n> \n> Distance: Manhattan distance to (2,2) is |4-2| + |5-2| = 2 + 3 = 5.\n> \n> To (2,1) is |4-2| + |5-1| = 2 + 4 = 6.\n> \n> But with obstacles and snake body, path might be longer.\n> \n> I need to plan a sequence to eat one or both foods while avoiding risks.\n> \n> First, let's sketch the grid.\n> \n> Grid: 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7). (0,0) bottom-left? Since y=0 bottom, but coordinates: let's assume (0,0) is bottom-left, so x right, y up.\n> \n> Walls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Internal obstacle at (1,6).\n> \n> Snake: head (4,5), body (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5). So positions: (4,5) head, then up to (4,6), then right to (5,6), right to (6,6), then down to (6,5). So the snake is like a \"U\" shape or something. From head down to (4,5), then up to (4,6), then right to (5,6), (6,6), then down to (6,5). So it's bent.\n> \n> Foods at (2,2) and (2,1).\n> \n> Life span: (2,2) expires soon, in 5 turns, last chance turn 13. (2,1) lasts longer, until turn 16.\n> \n> Turn 9 now.\n> \n> I need to go towards the food, but carefully.\n> \n> Possible moves: D, L, R.\n> \n> If I move down to (4,4), that might be away from food.\n> \n> Left to (3,5) is closer to x=2.\n> \n> Right to (5,5) is away.\n> \n> So left seems better to go towards (2,2) or (2,1).\n> \n> But let's think step by step.\n> \n> First, I should consider the tail and body.\n> \n> The tail is at (6,5). When the snake moves, the tail moves forward, so after one move, the tail will be at the previous position of the second last segment, but since it's a list, when head moves, the tail segment is removed, and a new segment added at head if food eaten, else same length.\n> \n> But no food eaten yet, so length remains 5.\n> \n> After move, head to new position, body follows, so tail moves away from its current position.\n> \n> For example, if I move left to (3,5), new positions: head (3,5), then (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), and tail (6,5) is gone? Let's see: original positions: index 0: head (4,5), 1: (4,6), 2: (5,6), 3: (6,6), 4: tail (6,5).\n> \n> After moving head to (3,5), the new body: head (3,5), then the previous head becomes body, so (4,5) is now segment 1, then (4,6) segment 2, (5,6) segment 3, (6,6) segment 4, and the tail (6,5) is left behind, so it disappears. New tail is (6,6)? Positions: after move to (3,5):\n> \n> - New head: (3,5)\n> \n> - Then body: the previous segments shift, so segment that was at (4,5) is now at position 1, but the position is (4,5), then segment that was at (4,6) is now at position 2, (4,6), then (5,6) at position 3, (5,6), then (6,6) at position 4, (6,6), and the old tail (6,5) is removed.\n> \n> So new snake: [(3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6)]\n> \n> Similarly, if move down to (4,4): head (4,4), then (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), and tail (6,5) gone.\n> \n> If move right to (5,5): head (5,5), then (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), tail (6,5) gone.\n> \n> Now, for food: food at (2,2) and (2,1) can be eaten if head moves there when it's free, but currently not under snake.\n> \n> Also, tail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it kills.

Snake: [(2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6)]\n> \n> (6,6) removed.\n> \n> Now, (2,5) is safe? Walls: x=0 left, x=7 right, y=0 bottom, y=7 top. (2,5) within bounds. Obstacle (1,6), not (2,5). Snake body: (3,5), (4,5), etc., (2,5) not occupied, so ok.\n> \n> Turn 11: from (2,5), move D to (2,4). Head direction was left, now down, allowed. New head (2,4), body: (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6). Snake: [(2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6)]\n> \n> (5,6) gone? Positions: after move, head to (2,4), previous head (2,5) becomes body, then (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), and the last segment (5,6) is removed. So yes, (4,6) is kept, (5,6) gone.\n> \n> Now, (2,4) safe.\n> \n> Turn 12: from (2,4), move D to (2,3). Head direction down, moving down, ok. New head (2,3), body: (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5). (4,6) gone? Snake: [(2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5)]\n> \n> (4,6) removed.\n> \n> (2,3) safe.\n> \n> Turn 13: from (2,3), move D to (2,2). Eat food. Now, since food eaten, snake grows, so new head at (2,2), and the tail doesn't move, so body: (2,3) becomes new segment after head, then (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), and (4,5) is still there? When eating, the head moves to food, and a new segment is added at the tail, so length increases.\n> \n> After move to (2,2) and eat, snake: head (2,2), then previous head (2,3) is now body, then (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), and since food eaten, add a new segment at the previous tail position, which was (4,5). But the previous tail is (4,5), so new snake: [(2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5)]? Let's see the sequence.\n> \n> Before move at turn 13: snake positions [(2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5)] head at (2,3), body (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), tail (4,5).\n> \n> Move head to (2,2), which has food. So new head (2,2), then the body: (2,3) becomes segment 1, (2,4) segment 2, (2,5) segment 3, (3,5) segment 4, and since food eaten, we add a new segment at the end, so the tail is now at (4,5), but (4,5) was the previous tail, so it stays, and we add a copy? Standard snake: when no food, tail moves away; when food eaten, tail stays, so length increases by one.\n> \n> Positions: new head at (2,2), then the previous segments remain, with an additional segment at the previous tail position.\n> \n> So before move: segments: 0: (2,3) head, 1: (2,4), 2: (2,5), 3: (3,5), 4: (4,5) tail.\n> \n> After moving head to (2,2) and eating food: new head (2,2), then segment 0 was (2,3) is now body at (2,3), segment 1 was (2,4) at (2,4), segment 2 was (2,5) at (2,5), segment 3 was (3,5) at (3,5), and segment 4 was (4,5) but since food eaten, we keep (4,5) and add a new segment at (4,5)? No.\n> \n> Typically, the body follows the head, so when head moves to new cell, the first body segment moves to where head was, and so on, and if food not eaten, tail leaves; if food eaten, tail doesn't leave, so the new tail is the same as before, but since a segment is added, the position that was tail remains occupied.\n> \n> After move: head at new position (2,2), then the segment that was at index 0 (head) moves to where head was, so (2,3) is now occupied by the first body segment, then index 1 moves to where index 0 was, so (2,4) occupied by what was index 1, and so on.\n> \n> Specifically:\n> \n> - New head: (2,2)\n> \n> - Then, the previous head position (2,3) is now occupied by the segment that was index 1 ( (2,4) ), but let's index the positions.\n> \n> Before move: positions list: [ (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5) ]\n> \n> After moving head to (2,2):\n> \n> - Head moves to (2,2)\n> \n> - Each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment in the list.\n> \n> So segment that was at (2,4) moves to (2,3) (previous head position)\n> \n> Segment that was at (2,5) moves to (2,4)\n> \n> Segment that was at (3,5) moves to (2,5)\n> \n> Segment that was at (4,5) moves to (3,5)\n> \n> And since food eaten, we add a new segment at the position where the tail was, but the tail moved to (3,5), so we add a new segment at (3,5)? That would be duplicate.\n> \n> I think I have confusion.\n> \n> Standard way: the snake body follows, so when head moves, each body segment takes the place of the previous one.\n> \n> So after head moves to new position, the new body starts from the old head position, then the old body positions shift.\n> \n> After move:\n> \n> - New position 0: (2,2) head\n> \n> - New position 1: old position 0, which is (2,3)\n> \n> - New position 2: old position 1, which is (2,4)\n> \n> - New position 3: old position 2, which is (2,5)\n> \n> - New position 4: old position 3, which is (3,5)\n> \n> - And since food eaten, we add a new segment at the end, which is the old position 4, (4,5). But old position 4 is (4,5), and it was the tail, but now we add a new segment at (4,5), so positions: (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5)\n> \n> But (3,5) was moved to from (3,5) to? In the shift, the segment that was at (3,5) moves to (2,5), and the segment at (4,5) moves to (3,5), then we add a new segment at (4,5).\n> \n> Yes: new segments:\n> \n> - Head: (2,2)\n> \n> - Body 1: old head position (2,3)\n> \n> - Body 2: old body1 position (2,4)\n> \n> - Body 3: old body2 position (2,5)\n> \n> - Body 4: old body3 position (3,5)  // which was (3,5), now at (3,5)? Old body3 was at (3,5), but after move, it moves to the position of old body2, which is (2,5)? Let's list old positions:\n> \n> Old positions before move: index 0: (2,3), 1: (2,4), 2: (2,5), 3: (3,5), 4: (4,5)\n> \n> After head moves to (2,2):\n> \n> - New index 0: (2,2)  // head\n> \n> - New index 1: old index 0 = (2,3)\n> \n> - New index 2: old index 1 = (2,4)\n> \n> - New index 3: old index 2 = (2,5)\n> \n> - New index 4: old index 3 = (3,5)\n> \n> - Since food eaten, add new segment at old index 4 position, which is (4,5)\n> \n> So new snake: [(2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5)]\n> \n> Length 6.\n> \n> And (4,5) is occupied, but it's the tail.\n> \n> Back to the plan.\n> \n> In this path, by moving left at turn 9, I can eat (2,2) at turn 13.\n> \n> What about (2,1)?

positive food at (2,2) before it expires (life span 5, last chance turn 13) by moving left immediately to reduce the x-distance, then descending vertically to avoid risks and ensure consumption by

It's turn 10, and the grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So coordinates from (0,0) to (7,7), but (0,0) to (7,7) inclusive? Walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6)? Let me confirm.\n> \n> Border cells: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. So any cell with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 is a wall. Playable cells are x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? x=0 to x=7 means 8 columns, but x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x from 1 to 6 is playable. Similarly y from 1 to 6. But y=0 and y=7 are walls, so yes, playable grid is 1 to 6 in both x and y.\n> \n> Also, there's an internal obstacle at (1,6). So (1,6) is blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (3,5), then (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6). So the snake is 5 segments long.\n> \n> Head direction is L, which is left, so moving towards decreasing x.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (2,2) with life span 4, value +1 (positive food)\n> \n> - (2,1) with life span 7, value +1\n> \n> - (1,1) with life span 10, value +1\n> \n> All food is positive, no negative food here. Value 1 means +1, so all good.\n> \n> Life span: for (2,2), life span 4, meaning it disappears after 4 turns including current turn? Let's see the rule: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span), Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So at turn t, if life_span is L, it will disappear after L turns, so it exists for turns t, t+1, ..., t+L-1? Countdown decreases every turn, including current.\n> \n> Let's clarify: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" and \"disappears after N turns\".\n> \n> So, for a food with life_span N at turn t, the countdown starts at N and decreases by 1 each turn. When countdown reaches 0, it disappears at the end of that turn? The rule says \"disappears after N turns\", which might be ambiguous.\n> \n> \"Disappears after N turns\" – I think it means it will disappear after N turns from now, so at turn t + N, it is gone.

I think it's better to think of the number of turns it will remain.\n> \n> For example, life_span 4 at turn 10:\n> \n> - Turn 10: present, countdown 4\n> \n> - Turn 11: present, countdown 3\n> \n> - Turn 12: present, countdown 2\n> \n> - Turn 13: present, countdown 1\n> \n> - Turn 14: countdown 0, disappears, so not present on turn 14.\n> \n> Similarly, for (2,1) life_span 7 at turn 10: present until turn 16, gone on turn 17.\n> \n> (1,1) life_span 10: present until turn 19, gone on turn 20.\n> \n> Now, current turn is 10.\n> \n> Snake head at (3,5), direction left, so last move was left to (3,5) from (4,5)?

Possible moves: U (up), D (down), L (left).\n> \n> But L is left, which is same direction, U and D are perpendicular.\n> \n> Now, let's see the grid. Playable area: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except obstacle at (1,6).\n> \n> So cells: (1,1) to (6,6), but (1,6) is obstacle, so not accessible.\n> \n> Snake positions: (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6). So body segments at (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6).\n> \n> Head at (3,5).\n> \n> Now, adjacent cells to head:\n> \n> - Up: (3,6) – is this accessible? y=6, x=3. y=6 is not wall, since walls are y=0 and y=7, so y=6 is playable. x=3, y=6. But is it occupied? Snake body: (4,6) and (5,6) and (6,6), but (3,6) is not in positions, so free? Also, obstacle at (1,6), but (3,6) is not obstacle.\n> \n> Positions: (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6). So (3,6) is not occupied.\n> \n> But (4,6) is occupied, but (3,6) is different cell.\n> \n> Similarly, down: (3,4) – y=4, x=3, should be free.\n> \n> Left: (2,5) – x=2, y=5, should be free.\n> \n> Right: (4,5) – but (4,5) is the second segment, which is the neck. But since the tail will move, moving right to (4,5) might be possible if it becomes free after tail moves.\n> \n> Rule: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, when I move, the head moves to a new cell, and the tail moves away from its current position, so if I move to the current tail position, it should be ok, because after move, tail moves, so no collision.\n> \n> But in this case, the cell occupied by tail is (6,6). Head is at (3,5), so (6,6) is far.\n> \n> But for adjacent cells, let's list possible moves from (3,5):\n> \n> - U (up): to (3,6)\n> \n> - D (down): to (3,4)\n> \n> - L (left): to (2,5)\n> \n> - R (right): to (4,5)\n> \n> But (4,5) is currently occupied by the second segment. Since the snake moves, when I move, the head goes to new position, and each segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, so the tail segment is removed.\n> \n> So, if I move right to (4,5), which is currently occupied, but after the move, the head will be at (4,5), and the body segments shift: the old head (3,5) becomes new second segment, and the tail (6,6) is removed, so the cell (4,5) is now head, and (3,5) is body, etc. Since the tail moves, the cell that was tail is vacated, but here I'm moving to a body cell that is not tail.\n> \n> Specifically, moving to (4,5) which is the immediate next segment. In snake games, moving directly into the neck is a collision, but the rule says: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> It does not say anything about moving into non-tail body segments. So moving to a cell occupied by a body segment other than tail should be a collision.\n> \n> Let me read carefully.\n> \n> \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, only the tail cell is safe to move into because it moves away. Other body segments do not move away immediately; they shift but the cell is still occupied by the body until the move.\n> \n> When you move, the head moves first to a new cell. If that cell is occupied by a body segment, it's a collision, except if it is the tail segment, because after the move, the tail moves, so that cell is empty.\n> \n> But for non-tail segments, if you move to a cell that is, say, the second segment, after move, that cell might be occupied by the new body or something.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: the head moves to a new cell. If that cell is not free (wall, body, etc.), it dies. But if it is the tail cell, since tail moves, it's ok.\n> \n> For other body segments, if head moves there, it collides because that segment is still there.\n> \n> In this case, for move to (4,5): (4,5) is currently the second segment. After moving head to (4,5), the second segment was at (4,5), but it will move to where the head was, (3,5), so the cell (4,5) is now head, and (3,5) is the new second segment position. But at the moment of move, when head moves to (4,5), it is entering a cell that is occupied, so it should be a collision.\n> \n> The rule says \"head touches any body segment\" is collision, but with exception for tail segment.\n> \n> So moving to (4,5) should be invalid because it's a body segment (not tail).\n> \n> Similarly, in this position, the tail is at (6,6), so only moving to (6,6) would be safe, but it's not adjacent.\n> \n> So from (3,5), adjacent cells:\n> \n> - (3,6): above, y=6, x=3. Is it wall? Walls are x=0,7 or y=0,7, so y=6 <7, x=3 between 1-6, so not wall. Obstacle at (1,6), but (3,6) is not (1,6), so free. No food mentioned there, so empty.\n> \n> - (3,4): below, y=4, x=3, not wall, not obstacle, not occupied, empty.\n> \n> - (2,5): left, x=2, y=5, not wall, not obstacle, empty? Food at (2,2), (2,1), (1,1), not (2,5), so empty.\n> \n> - (4,5): right, but occupied by body, so invalid.\n> \n> Also, since direction is L, I cannot move R anyway because of no instant reverse.\n> \n> So possible actions: U, D, L. R is invalid due to reverse and also occupied.\n> \n> L is left, to (2,5).\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score, prioritize survival.\n> \n> Food available: (2,2), (2,1), (1,1) all positive, but different life spans.\n> \n> (2,2) has life span 4, so at turn 10, countdown 4, so it disappears after turn 13? Let's calculate.\n> \n> Turn 10: life_span 4, so present on turn 10,11,12; gone on turn 13? Countdown: at turn 10, countdown=4; turn 11, countdown=3; turn 12, countdown=2; turn 13, countdown=1; turn 14, countdown=0 disappear. Rule: \"disappears after N turns\" and countdown decreases each turn including current.\n> \n> \"Disappears after N turns\" – I think \"after N turns\" means after N turns from now, so at turn t+N it is gone.\n> \n> For example, at turn t, if N=1, it disappears after 1 turn, so gone at turn t+1.\n> \n> If N=1 at turn t, countdown=1, then after turn t, it disappears, so not present on turn t+1.\n> \n> Similarly, N=4 at turn 10: present on turn 10,11,12; after turn 12, countdown=1? Turn 10: countdown=4, present\n> \n> Turn 11: countdown=3, present\n> \n> Turn 12: countdown=2, present\n> \n> Turn 13: countdown=1, present?

So, the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), but with (1,6) blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (3,4), then body segments at (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6). So the snake is 5 segments long. Head direction is down, which is (x,y-1). Since it's moving down, the head is at (3,4), and moving down would go to (3,3), but let's confirm the coordinate system. Typically, in grids, y=0 might be top or bottom, but here it says U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), so y increases upwards? Let's see:\n> \n> - U: (x,y+1) – moving up increases y\n> \n> - D: (x,y-1) – moving down decreases y\n> \n> - L: (x-1,y)\n> \n> - R: (x+1,y)\n> \n> And walls at y=0 and y=7, with y=0 being bottom or top? Since moving down decreases y, and walls at y=0 and y=7, it might be that y=0 is the bottom row, y=7 is the top row? No, let's think carefully.\n> \n> The borders are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid is from (0,0) to (7,7), but x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, so the snake can only be in cells where 1 <= x <= 6 and 1 <= y <= 6, except for obstacles.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (1,6), so that cell is blocked.\n> \n> Now, snake positions: head (3,4), body (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6). Since head is at (3,4) and direction is down, which is decreasing y, so from (3,4) to (3,3) would be down, but (3,5) is above it? y=5 is higher than y=4 if y increases upwards.\n> \n> If U is (x,y+1), that means increasing y moves up, so higher y is north, lower y is south. So head at (3,4), moving down to (3,3) would be south.\n> \n> But the body segments: (3,5) is at y=5, which is north of (3,4), then (4,5) east, (4,6) north, (5,6) east. So the snake is shaped like: from head (3,4) down? Direction is D, so it was moving down to (3,4), but the previous position must have been above, but let's see the positions: positions are given as [(3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6)], so head is first, so at turn 11, head is at (3,4), then the body is (3,5), which is the segment behind the head, so when the snake moves, the head moves to a new cell, and the tail moves forward.\n> \n> Direction is D, meaning it just moved down to (3,4). So before, head was at (3,5) or something? Positions: [(3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6)] with head direction D.\n> \n> Since direction is down, and head is at (3,4), that means it came from (3,5), because moving down from (3,5) to (3,4). But in the list, (3,5) is the second segment, which is the neck. So yes, it was at (3,5) and moved down to (3,4) on this turn or previous? Turn is current turn t1=11, so at the start of turn 11, the snake is at these positions, and I need to choose the next move.\n> \n> So at turn 11, the snake head is at (3,4), and it is facing down, so from (3,4), possible moves are U, D, L, R, but with no instant reverse. Since it's facing down, reverse would be up (U), so I cannot move up on this turn because that would be opposite to current direction.\n> \n> Current head direction is D, so I cannot move U immediately. So possible moves from (3,4) are D (down), L (left), R (right). Moving U is not allowed because it's reverse.\n> \n> Now, food positions:\n> \n> - (2,2) with value 1, life span 3\n> \n> - (2,1) with value 1, life span 6\n> \n> - (1,1) with value 1, life span 9\n> \n> All food has value +1, so all are positive food, no negative food mentioned. Life span decreases each turn, so at turn 11, for (2,2), life span 3, meaning it disappears after 3 more turns? Let's see the rule: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\", and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So at turn t, if life span is L, it will disappear after L turns, meaning at the end of turn t+L, it's gone. And each turn, including turn t, the countdown decreases.\n> \n> For food at (2,2) with life span 3 at turn 11, it will disappear after turn 14 (since turns include current: after 3 turns, turn 11,12,13, gone at turn 14? Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" and \"disappears after N turns\".\n> \n> So at turn t, life span N, it decreases to N-1 at the start of turn t+1? Or at the end of turn t?\n> \n> Typically, it might be: at the beginning of turn t, the food has life span L, and during turn t, if not eaten, at the end of turn, L decreases by 1. If L was 1, it disappears after turn t.\n> \n> But the rule says \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so for a food present at turn t with life span L, after turn t, life span becomes L-1, and so on, until L=0, it disappears.\n> \n> For (2,2): life span 3 at turn 11. After turn 11, life span becomes 2; after turn 12, life span 1; after turn 13, life span 0, so it disappears and is not available on turn 14.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,1): life span 6 at turn 11, so it will disappear after turn 16 (after 6 decreases).\n> \n> (1,1): life span 9, disappear after turn 19.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan moves for turns 11,12,13,14,15 at least, since think 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> Current snake head at (3,4), direction D.\n> \n> Possible moves from (3,4): D (down to (3,3)), L (left to (2,4)), R (right to (4,4)). Cannot move U because reverse.\n> \n> Now, I need to consider the food and avoid collisions.\n> \n> First, let's map the grid.\n> \n> Grid size: walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so cells from (1,1) to (6,6) are playable, except internal obstacle at (1,6), so (1,6) is blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions: (3,4) head, (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6) tail.\n> \n> So let's list occupied cells: (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6). Since the snake moves, when head moves, tail moves, so cells free except these.\n> \n> Food at (2,2), (2,1), (1,1).\n> \n> (2,1) and (1,1) are near the bottom-left corner.\n> \n> Also, (1,1) might be accessible, but (1,6) is blocked, so y=6 row has obstacle at x=1.\n> \n> Now, I need to think about path to food and survival.\n> \n> First, let's consider moving towards the food.\n> \n> The food at (2,2) has only 3 turns left, life span 3 at turn 11, so if not eaten by turn 13, it disappears.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,1) has more time, life span 6.\n> \n> (1,1) has plenty of time.\n> \n> But all are +1, so I should try to eat them if possible without risk.\n> \n> Now, from (3,4), moving down to (3,3) is possible, since (3,3) is free? Let's see free cells.\n> \n> Free cells: all except snake and walls and obstacles.\n> \n> Snake occupies: (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6)\n> \n> Walls: borders and (1,6)\n> \n> So (3,3) is within bounds and not occupied, so free.\n> \n> (2,4) is free? x=2,y=4, not occupied, not wall.\n> \n> (4,4) is free? x=4,y=4, not occupied.\n> \n> Now, moving to (3,3) down: but (3,3) is free, no immediate collision.\n> \n> But I need to think ahead.\n> \n> Also, tail is at (5,6), which will move when the snake moves.\n> \n> Now, about the special case: food under body. But here, food is at (2,2), (2,1), (1,1), all not under snake, so no issue.\n> \n> Tail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it kills. But tail is at (5,6), and there's no food there, so no problem.\n> \n> Now, let's plan a sequence.\n> \n> First, I need to get to the food. The closest food is (2,2), at distance |3-2| + |4-2| = 1 + 2 = 3 Manhattan distance.\n> \n> (2,1) is |3-2| + |4-1| =1 +3=4, (1,1) is |3-1| + |4-1|=2+3=5.\n> \n> (2,2) is closest, but with short life.\n> \n> I should head towards (2,2) if possible.\n> \n> From (3,4), to go to (2,2), I need to go left and down.\n> \n> Possible moves: L to (2,4), then down to (2,3), then down to (2,2).

If I moved left, direction is L, so I can move L, D, U, but not R (reverse).\n> \n> From (2,4), to go to (2,2), I need to move down twice: to (2,3) then (2,2).\n> \n> (2,3) should be free now, but let's simulate snake movement.\n> \n> At turn 11: snake positions: [(3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6)]\n> \n> I move, say, L to (2,4).\n> \n> Then new head position: (2,4)\n> \n> Then the body: since head moved to (2,4), the neck was (3,4) which becomes the new segment 2, but the positions update: the tail moves off (5,6), so new positions: head (2,4), then (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6) — tail was (5,6), which is removed, and new tail is (4,6)? Let's see: when head moves to new cell, the last segment (tail) is removed, so segments: new head at (2,4), then previous head (3,4) becomes segment 2, (3,5) segment 3, (4,5) segment 4, (4,6) segment 5? Positions: before move: index 0: (3,4), 1: (3,5), 2: (4,5), 3: (4,6), 4: (5,6)\n> \n> After moving head to (2,4), the new positions: head (2,4), then segment 1 is previous segment 0 (3,4), segment 2 is previous segment 1 (3,5), segment 3 is previous segment 2 (4,5), segment 4 is previous segment 3 (4,6). The tail (previous segment 4 (5,6)) is removed.

After turn 11, life span 2; after turn 12, life span 1; after turn 13, life span 0, disappears. So on turn 13, when I move to (2,2), it should be there if I act before it disappears.\n> \n> Life span at turn 11: 3, so after turn 11 (i.e., end of turn 11), life span decreases to 2. Then after turn 12, to 1. Then after turn 13, to 0 and disappears. So on turn 13, during the turn, the food is still there with life span 1, so I can eat it on turn 13.\n> \n> If I move to (2,2) on turn 13, I eat it.\n> \n> Now, when I eat food, snake grows, so length increases.\n> \n> If I eat on turn 13, at (2,2), then after eating, the tail doesn't move, so snake grows by one segment.\n> \n> In this case, on turn 13, when head moves to (2,2), which has food, I eat it, so the new positions: head at (2,2), and the tail stays, so segments: head (2,2), then previous head (2,3) becomes segment, and so on, with tail not removed.\n> \n> Before move: positions at start of turn 13: let's trace.\n> \n> Turn 11 start: positions [(3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6)]\n> \n> Turn 11 move L to (2,4): new positions [(2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6)]\n> \n> Turn 12 start: positions as above.\n> \n> Turn 12 move D to (2,3): new positions [(2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)]\n> \n> Tail was (4,6), removed.\n> \n> Turn 13 start: positions [(2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)]\n> \n> Now move D to (2,2).

It's turn 13. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and an internal obstacle at (1,6). So the grid is from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls block those cells.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (2,3), then body segments at (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5). So the snake has 5 segments. Head direction is down, which is (x,y-1). Since direction is D, moving down means decreasing y.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (2,2) with value 1 and life span 1. So it disappears after turn 13 + 1 = 14? Life span is given, and it decreases every turn including current. Turn is 13, life span 1, so after this turn, it will have life span 0, meaning it disappears at the start of turn 14 or something? I need to clarify.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So at turn t, if food has life span L, it will disappear after L turns, meaning it's there for L more turns including this one.\n> \n> For (2,2): value 1, life span 1. At turn 13, life span is 1, so it will disappear after this turn. That means if the snake doesn't eat it on this turn (turn 13), it will be gone forever. Since the snake moves on turn 13, if it moves to (2,2) now, it can eat it.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,1) value 1, life span 4, so it will disappear after 4 turns, meaning it lasts until turn 13 + 4 - 1? Let's think carefully.\n> \n> If life span is L at turn t, it decreases each turn, so:\n> \n> - At turn t: life span L, present\n> \n> - After turn t, life span becomes L-1\n> \n> - When life span reaches 0, it disappears, so it's not present at the start of the next turn.\n> \n> For example, life span 1 at turn t: after turn t, it becomes 0, so it disappears, not available for turn t+1.\n> \n> Similarly, life span 4 at turn 13: after turn 13, life span 3; after turn 14, life span 2; after turn 15, life span 1; after turn 16, life span 0, disappears, not available turn 17.\n> \n> So for (2,2): life span 1 at turn 13. If not eaten on turn 13, it disappears and won't be there for turn 14.\n> \n> (2,1): life span 4, so it will be there for turns 13,14,15,16, and disappear after turn 16.\n> \n> (1,1): value 1, life span 7, so lasts longer.\n> \n> (5,1): value 1, life span 10, also long.\n> \n> All food has value 1, positive, no negative food here. Value is +1 for all, and it increases length if eaten.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (2,3), direction down. From direction D, possible moves: since no instant reverse, cannot go up (U), because U is opposite of D. Opposite directions: U and D are opposites, L and R are opposites.\n> \n> Current direction D, so cannot go U next. Can go D, L, or R.\n> \n> Possible actions for turn 13: D (down), L (left), R (right).\n> \n> Now, let's see the grid.\n> \n> Walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, so cells like (0,y) or (x,0) etc. are invalid.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (1,6), so (1,6) is blocked.\n> \n> Snake body: positions (2,3) head, (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5). So the tail is at (4,5).\n> \n> Food at (2,2), (2,1), (1,1), (5,1).\n> \n> (2,2) is directly below the head? Head at (2,3), down to (2,2) is decreasing y, so (2,2) is one step down.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,1) is two steps down from head, but one step from (2,2).\n> \n> Also, (1,1) is left and down, (5,1) is right and down.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead, maximize score, avoid risks.\n> \n> First, immediate concern: food at (2,2) has life span 1, so if we don't eat it now, it's gone. But is it safe to eat?\n> \n> (2,2) is adjacent to head? Head at (2,3), (2,2) is directly below, so moving down to (2,2) is possible.\n> \n> But is there any danger?\n> \n> First, collision: moving to (2,2). Is (2,2) occupied by body? Snake positions: (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5). So (2,2) is not in the body, so no collision.\n> \n> Walls: (2,2) is within bounds, x=2 between 0 and 7? x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x=2 is fine, y=2, y=0 is wall, so y=2 is fine.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: only (1,6), not (2,2), so clear.\n> \n> But there's a special case: food can be under body, but here (2,2) is not under body, it's empty.\n> \n> Also, tail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it kills. But here, tail is at (4,5), which is not adjacent to head. Head at (2,3), tail at (4,5), distance |2-4| + |3-5| = 2 + 2 = 4, not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing a side, so up, down, left, right.\n> \n> (2,3) to (4,5) is not adjacent; adjacent cells would be like (2,4), (3,3), (1,3), (2,2), etc.\n> \n> (2,2) is adjacent to head, but it's not the tail; the tail is at (4,5), far away.\n> \n> So no issue.\n> \n> Therefore, moving to (2,2) to eat the food seems safe and beneficial. Score +1, length increases by one.\n> \n> But I need to think long-term.\n> \n> If I move down to (2,2), I eat the food, so new head position (2,2), and snake grows to 6 segments: head at (2,2), then the previous head (2,3) becomes body, so positions: [(2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)]\n> \n> Tail is still at (4,5), but after move, tail moves? When snake eats, it grows, so after moving to food, the tail doesn't move; it stays, so length increases.\n> \n> Rule: when eating positive food, length +1, so the tail doesn't advance; a new segment is added where the food was, but since head moves there, it's like the head occupies the food cell, and the body follows, with tail staying put.\n> \n> Standard snake: when you eat, you grow, so next move the tail doesn't move, increasing length.\n> \n> Here: \"Length of snake +1\" for positive food.\n> \n> In movement, when head moves to a new cell, if it's food, it eats and grows, so the body segments remain, and tail doesn't move for that turn. If not food, tail moves forward.\n> \n> But in terms of positions: after eating, the new head is at food position, and the previous positions are all body, with tail unchanged, so length increases by one.\n> \n> For example, here: current positions: [ (2,3)H, (2,4)B, (3,4)B, (3,5)B, (4,5)T ]\n> \n> If move down to (2,2), which has food, eat it, so new positions: [ (2,2)H, (2,3)B, (2,4)B, (3,4)B, (3,5)B, (4,5)T ] so tail still at (4,5), length 6.\n> \n> If no food, move to empty cell, then new head at new position, and tail moves off the last position, so length same.\n> \n> But here, since we eat, length increases.\n> \n> Now, after moving to (2,2), head at (2,2), direction was D, so now moving down to (2,2), new direction is D.\n> \n> Now, possible moves from (2,2): cannot go up (U) because reverse, but current direction is D, so can go D, L, R.\n> \n> D: to (2,1) – is that possible? (2,1) has food, but let's see.\n> \n> First, food at (2,1) is there, life span 4, so not urgent.\n> \n> But from (2,2), moving to (2,1) down.\n> \n> (2,1) is within bounds, not wall, not body currently? Current body: after move, positions include (2,3), (2,4), etc., but (2,1) is free now?

I need to maximize my score by eating positive food while avoiding risks. I must think at least 5 turns ahead and prioritize long-term survival over immediate rewards.

Also, there's an internal obstacle at (1,6). So, I need to avoid that cell.\n> \n> Snake positions: Head is at (1,1), then body segments at (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5). So the snake has 7 segments. Head is at (1,1) and tail is at (3,5).\n> \n> Head direction is Down (D). That means the snake was moving downwards to reach (1,1). Since direction is D, and head is at (1,1), it must have come from above, like from (1,0), but y=0 is a wall, so it couldn't have come from there. Let me check the positions.\n> \n> Snake positions: [(1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5)]\n> \n> Head is (1,1), and the next segment is (1,2). Since head is at (1,1) and body at (1,2), that means the snake is moving upwards? I'm confused.\n> \n> If head is at (1,1) and the next segment is at (1,2), that means the head is below the neck, so it must be moving upwards. But the head direction is given as D, which is down. That doesn't match.\n> \n> Direction is D, down. Down means increasing y? No, in grid coordinates, typically y increases upwards or downwards? I need to clarify the coordinate system.\n> \n> The movement definitions: U (x,y+1), D (x,y-1). So U is up (y increases), D is down (y decreases). But in the state, it says U(x,y+1), D(x,y-1), so:\n> \n> - U: (x, y+1) — up, y increases\n> \n> - D: (x, y-1) — down, y decreases\n> \n> - L: (x-1, y) — left\n> \n> - R: (x+1, y) — right\n> \n> Now, snake positions: head at (1,1), next at (1,2). Since next is (1,2), which has higher y, so it's above head? Let's list the positions in order:\n> \n> Index 0: head (1,1)\n> \n> Index 1: (1,2)  // this is above (1,1) since y=2 > y=1\n> \n> Index 2: (2,2)\n> \n> Index 3: (2,3)  // y=3, higher\n> \n> Index 4: (2,4)  // y=4\n> \n> Index 5: (3,4)\n> \n> Index 6: (3,5)  // tail at (3,5)\n> \n> Head direction is D, down. But if head is at (1,1) and moving down, it should go to (1,0), but y=0 is wall, so it can't. But it is at (1,1) with direction D. How did it get there?\n> \n> Perhaps it moved to (1,1) from above, but above is (1,2), which is the body, so it must have turned or something. Let's see the previous move.\n> \n> Since direction is D, and head is at (1,1), it must have come from (1,2) moving down to (1,1). But (1,2) is occupied by the body, so that makes sense; the head was at (1,2) and moved down to (1,1), so now the body segments follow.\n> \n> After moving, the head is at (1,1), and the body will move, so the segment that was at (1,2) will move to where the head was or something? I need to think about how the snake moves.\n> \n> In Snake, when the head moves to a new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment. So, from positions: before move, head was at some position, let's say the previous head was at (x_prev, y_prev), and it moved to (1,1) with direction D.\n> \n> Since direction is D, and it moved to (1,1), it came from (1,2) because D is (x,y-1), so from (1,2) to (1,1) is down, y decreases.\n> \n> Then, the body: after move, the segment that was at index 1 (1,2) will be replaced by the new head position, but the head moved to (1,1), which was empty or food, I assume.\n> \n> Now the positions are: head at (1,1), then the first body segment is at (1,2), which was the previous head position? No.\n> \n> Let's denote the positions before the move at turn 15 or something. But I don't have that. At turn 16, the positions are given as current, so [(1,1), (1,2), (2,2), ...] means head at (1,1), neck at (1,2), then (2,2), etc.\n> \n> Since the head moved to (1,1) with direction D, it came from (1,2), so before the move, head was at (1,2), and it moved down to (1,1). Then, the body segments: the segment that was at (1,2) is now the neck at (1,2) in the new list? No.\n> \n> When the head moves to a new cell, the tail moves forward, so the body shifts.\n> \n> For example, before move at turn 15, positions might have been: head at (1,2), then (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), and tail at (3,5) or something. But with 7 segments, if head was at (1,2), and it moved down to (1,1), then new positions: head at (1,1), then the previous head position (1,2) becomes the new neck, so positions become [(1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5)] which matches, and the tail was at (3,5) before, and it stays or moves? In this case, since head moved to (1,1), which is not the tail, the tail at (3,5) will be removed or something? No, in Snake, when the head moves to a new cell, the tail end is removed unless food is eaten.\n> \n> But in this state, no food was eaten yet, I think, so the tail should move. Let's see the positions: from before, if positions were [(1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), tail] but tail is (3,5), and after moving down, head to (1,1), so new head (1,1), then the first body segment is the previous head (1,2), then (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), and the last segment (3,5) is removed, so the new tail is (3,4)? But in the list, it's (3,4) and (3,5), no.\n> \n> Positions have 7 segments: indices 0 to 6.\n> \n> After move: head at new position (1,1), then body segments: index 1 is previous head position, which was (1,2), index 2 is previous index 1, which was (2,2), etc., up to index 6 is previous index 5 or something.\n> \n> General: when snake moves without eating, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment in the list, so the last segment (tail) is removed.\n> \n> So for 7 segments, after move, it should have 7 segments only if it ate food; otherwise, it should have the same number, but tail moves.\n> \n> In this case, positions before move: let's say at turn 15, positions were [head, body1, body2, ..., body5, tail] for 7 segments.\n> \n> Head at P0, body at P1, P2, ..., P6.\n> \n> After moving head to new cell Q, the new positions are [Q, P0, P1, P2, ..., P5], so P6 is removed.\n> \n> So for current at turn 16, positions [(1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5)]\n> \n> So new head (1,1), which is Q.\n> \n> Previous head was P0 = (1,2)\n> \n> Then new body: (1,2) is P0, (2,2) is P1, (2,3) is P2, (2,4) is P3, (3,4) is P4, and (3,5) is P5. But P5 was the tail before? Before, there was P6, which is removed.\n> \n> Previous positions: head P0 = (1,2), then P1 = (2,2), P2 = (2,3), P3 = (2,4), P4 = (3,4), P5 = (3,5), and P6 = ? But there are 7 positions now, so before move, there must have been 7 segments, with P6 at some position.\n> \n> After move to (1,1), new positions: [ (1,1), P0, P1, P2, P3, P4, P5 ] = [ (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5) ]\n> \n> So P5 is (3,5), which was the second last, and the last segment P6 was removed. What was P6? It's not given, but from the positions, the tail was at P6 before, say (3,6) or something, but it's not important.\n> \n> Key point: head is at (1,1), direction is D, so it came from (1,2), moving down.\n> \n> Now, food positions:\n> \n> - (2,1) with value 1, life span 1\n> \n> - (5,1) with value 1, life span 7\n> \n> - (5,2) with value 1, life span 10\n> \n> All food have value +1, so all positive food, no negative food mentioned.\n> \n> Life span: (2,1) has life span 1, meaning it disappears after this turn or next? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 16, life span 1, so after this turn, it will be gone. \"Disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So for food at (2,1), life span 1 at turn 16, so at the end of turn 16, life span becomes 0, and it disappears. So if I move to it on turn 16, I can eat it, but since the turn is already 16, and I'm deciding the action for turn 16, I think I can still eat it if I move there.\n> \n> The state is at the start of turn 16, before I move.\n> \n> So for food with life span N at turn t, it will disappear after turn t + N - 1 or something? Let's read carefully.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span).

The grid is 8x8 because walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so coordinates go from (0,0) to (7,7). There's an internal obstacle at (1,6).\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (2,1), then (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5). So the snake has 8 segments. Head direction is right, meaning it's moving towards increasing x.\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (5,1) with life span 6 and value +1 (positive food)\n> \n> - (5,2) with life span 9 and value +1 (also positive food)\n> \n> Life span decreases every turn, including the current one. So at turn 17, life span 6 means it will disappear after 6 more turns, so at turn 23? Let's clarify: life span N means it disappears after N turns, counting from the current turn. So if current turn is t, food with life span L will disappear at turn t + L. For (5,1), L=6, so it disappears at turn 17 + 6 = 23. Similarly, (5,2) with L=9 disappears at turn 17 + 9 = 26.\n> \n> Both foods are positive, so eating them increases length by 1. No negative food here.\n> \n> Now, I need to choose actions for the next few turns, thinking at least 5 turns ahead. Priority is long-term survival over immediate rewards.\n> \n> Current head position: (2,1), direction right.\n> \n> Possible moves: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), L (left, x-1), R (right, x+1). But since head direction is right, I cannot instantly reverse to left. So possible moves are U, D, R.

Also internal obstacle at (1,6).\n> \n> Moving to (2,2): is this safe? (2,2) is part of the snake body? Snake positions: head (2,1), then (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), etc. (2,2) is the fourth segment. If I move to (2,2), the head would be colliding with the body segment at (2,2) before it moves away. But let's think carefully about movement.\n> \n> When the snake moves, the head moves to a new cell, and each body segment moves to the next position. The tail segment leaves its position.\n> \n> At the start of turn, snake is at positions: index 0: head (2,1), 1: (1,1), 2: (1,2), 3: (2,2), 4: (2,3), 5: (2,4), 6: (3,4), 7: (3,5) tail.\n> \n> After a move, say to (3,1) for example, new head is (3,1), then the body segments shift: segment 1 moves to (2,1), segment 2 to (1,1), segment 3 to (1,2), segment 4 to (2,2), segment 5 to (2,3), segment 6 to (2,4), segment 7 to (3,4), and the tail was (3,5), which is now gone? No: when head moves, the body shifts, so the segment that was at position 1 moves to where head was, position 2 moves to where position 1 was, and so on, and the tail position is vacated unless a food is eaten.\n> \n> Specifically, if no food eaten, head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, and the tail position is freed.\n> \n> If food eaten, head moves to food position, body segments move similarly, but a new segment is added at the tail end, so tail doesn't move; the position where tail was remains occupied.\n> \n> But for collision: head moves to a new cell. If that cell is occupied by a body segment or wall, it dies.\n> \n> The only exception is if moving into the tail position, because when head moves there, the tail moves away, so it's safe as long as it's only the tail.\n> \n> In this case, for moving to (2,2): (2,2) is currently occupied by segment 3. If I move head to (2,2), since (2,2) has a body segment, it would collide and die, because that segment is not the tail; it's in the middle.\n> \n> The tail is at (3,5), so (2,2) is not tail. Therefore, moving to (2,2) causes collision with body.\n> \n> Similarly, moving to (3,1): what is at (3,1)? From snake positions, (3,1) is not listed, so it should be empty? Snake positions: (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5). So (3,1) is not occupied, and not a wall. Walls are borders and (1,6). (3,1) is within 1 to 6 in x and y? x=3, y=1, borders x=0,7 y=0,7, so (3,1) is inside, not border.

So moving to (2,1) would collide with body.\n> \n> Therefore, only possible moves are U or R.\n> \n> Now, food: (5,1) with life span 5, value +1, and (5,2) with life span 8, value +1.\n> \n> Life span decreases each turn, including current, so at turn 18, life span 5 means it disappears after 5 more turns, so on turn 23 it's gone? Let's see.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So for food at (5,1), life span 5 at turn 18, so it will be there for turns 18,19,20,21,22, and disappear at turn 23? Countdown decreases every turn including current, so at turn 18, life span is 5, meaning after turn 18, it has 4 left? Or after turn 18, it has 5 turns including turn 18.\n> \n> I think it's better to think: life span N means it will disappear after N turns from now. So at turn t, if life span is L, it will be present for turns t, t+1, ..., t+L-1, and disappear at turn t+L.\n> \n> For example, if L=1 at turn t, it is only present on turn t, disappears after turn t.\n> \n> Similarly, L=5 at turn 18: present on turns 18,19,20,21,22, disappears at turn 23.\n> \n> Similarly for (5,2), L=8 at turn 18: present until turn 25 (turns 18 to 25 inclusive? Turns 18 to 18+7=25, since after 8 turns, disappear at turn 26? Let's calculate.\n> \n> Turn t, life span L: it is present for exactly L turns, starting from turn t. So from turn t to turn t+L-1 inclusive, disappears at turn t+L.\n> \n> So for (5,1): L=5 at t=18, present turns 18,19,20,21,22. Disappears at turn 23.\n> \n> (5,2): L=8 at t=18, present turns 18 to 25 (18+7=25, since 18 to 25 is 8 turns: 18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25), disappears at turn 26.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan a sequence of actions for at least 5 turns, but since food life spans are 5 and 8, I should consider up to turn 23 or so.\n> \n> But 5+ turns ahead, so plan for turns 18 to 22 or beyond.\n> \n> First, let's see the grid layout.\n> \n> Grid: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.

So the snake is coiled around.\n> \n> Path: from head (3,1), to (2,1), to (1,1), then down to (1,2)? (1,1) to (1,2) is down? y increases up? Directions: U is (x,y+1), so y+1 is up, y-1 is down. So (x,y) with y increasing up.\n> \n> Standard grid: usually y=0 bottom, y=7 top, but in coordinates, U is y+1, so higher y is up.\n> \n> In positions: (3,1) head, then (2,1) left, then (1,1) left, then (1,2) up, then (2,2) right, then (2,3) up, then (2,4) up, then (3,4) right. So tail at (3,4).\n> \n> Food at (5,1) and (5,2).\n> \n> (5,1) is to the right of head, since head at (3,1), x=3, (5,1) is x=5,y=1, so two steps right.\n> \n> (5,2) is above it, at (5,2).\n> \n> Head can move U to (3,2) or R to (4,1).\n> \n> If I move right to (4,1), then I'm closer to (5,1), which has short life span, only 5 turns left.\n> \n> But I need to think long-term.\n> \n> Also, there might be risks.\n> \n> First, let's consider moving towards the food.\n> \n> But (5,1) is at (5,1), and head at (3,1), so if I go right, to (4,1) on turn 18, then I can reach (5,1) on turn 19 by moving right again.\n> \n> But can I?

Currently, after turn 18, positions: (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4). So (5,1) not occupied, not wall, so can move R to (5,1).\n> \n> On turn 19, move R to (5,1), eat the food? (5,1) has food, positive, so eating it increases length by 1.\n> \n> When head moves to a cell with food, it eats it, and the snake grows, so tail doesn't move that turn.\n> \n> Food mechanics: when head moves to a food cell, it eats it, length increases by 1, and the tail doesn't move, so the new segment is added at the head position, but since head is there, the body extends.\n> \n> Specifically: if head moves to food, it eats it, snake grows, so the position where food was becomes new head, and the body doesn't shorten; the tail stays, so length increases.\n> \n> In terms of positions: when no food eaten, head moves to new cell, tail moves from old tail, so length same.\n> \n> When food eaten, head moves to new cell, tail does not move, so the new cell is added, and previous tail remains, so length +1.\n> \n> In this case, on turn 19, if head moves to (5,1), which has food, so it eats it, new length 9.\n> \n> New positions: head at (5,1), then the body: previous head (4,1) becomes segment 1, then (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4) -- tail was (2,4), but since food eaten, tail doesn't move, so segment 8 is still (2,4), and new segment 9 is (5,1)? No.\n> \n> Positions: after move to food, head is at food cell, and the previous head position is now part of body, but since tail didn't move, the body has one more segment.\n> \n> Before move: positions at turn 19 start: head (4,1), body (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4)\n> \n> After move: head moves to (5,1), eats food, so new head at (5,1), then the first body segment is at (4,1), then (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), and tail at (2,4) remains, so now snake is [(5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4)] -- 9 segments.\n> \n> Tail at (2,4).\n> \n> Head direction is R.\n> \n> Now, after eating (5,1), that food is gone.\n> \n> But (5,1) had life span 5, but we ate it, so it's consumed.\n> \n> Now, there is still (5,2) with life span 8, but at turn 19, life span decreases? Life span decreases every turn for all food.\n> \n> At turn 19, for (5,2), life span was 8 at turn 18, so at turn 19, it decreases to 7? Since countdown decreases every turn including current, but when we say at a turn, the life span is given.\n> \n> In state input, at turn t, life span is given, and it decreases each turn.\n> \n> So after turn 18, at turn 19, all food life spans decrease by 1.\n> \n> Similarly, when food is eaten, it's removed.\n> \n> But in this case, at turn 19, after eating (5,1), it's gone.\n> \n> Now, snake at (5,1), head, with body behind.\n> \n> Possible moves: from (5,1), direction R.\n> \n> Cannot reverse left, so can go U, D, R.\n> \n> D to (5,0): y=0 wall, invalid.\n> \n> U to (5,2): (5,2) has food, positive, and it's adjacent.\n> \n> R to (6,1): free?

Positions: from (5,2) to (2,4), that's 10 positions. Let's count: index 0: (5,2), 1: (5,1), 2: (4,1), 3: (3,1), 4: (2,1), 5: (1,1), 6: (1,2), 7: (2,2), 8: (2,3), 9: (2,4). Yes, 10 segments.\n> \n> Head direction is U, which is up. So moving up from (5,2) would go to (5,3), but let's see possible moves.\n> \n> Food: only one food mentioned: (5,5) with value 1 and life span 8. Value 1 means positive food, since +1.\n> \n> Life span 8, and it decreases each turn, including current turn, so after turn 21, it will have 7 turns left, and so on.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan actions for at least 5 turns ahead, starting from turn 21.\n> \n> First, what are the possible moves from current position (5,2) with head direction U.\n> \n> Possible directions: U, D, L, R, but cannot do instant reverse. Since current direction is U, reverse is D, so cannot move down immediately. So allowed moves: U, L, R. Not D.\n> \n> Now, let's see what each move leads to:\n> \n> - U: move to (5,3)\n> \n> - L: move to (4,2)\n> \n> - R: move to (6,2)\n> \n> Now, check for collisions or walls.\n> \n> Walls: border walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So grid is 1 to 6 in x and y? Coordinates: x=0 and x=7 are walls, so valid x: 1 to 6? Let's see.\n> \n> x=0 and x=7 are walls, so cells from x=1 to x=6 are free, similarly y=1 to y=6? y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y from 1 to 6 inclusive.\n> \n> For example, snake head is at (5,2), which is within 1 to 6.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (1,6).\n> \n> Now, check each possible move:\n> \n> - U to (5,3): is this a wall? x=5, y=3. Walls are at x=0,7 and y=0,7, so (5,3) is fine. Internal obstacle at (1,6), not here. Now, is it occupied by snake body? Snake positions: (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4). (5,3) is not in this list, so safe for now.\n> \n> - L to (4,2): (4,2) – not a wall. Is it in snake body? Positions: (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), etc. (4,2) not listed, so safe.\n> \n> - R to (6,2): (6,2) – x=6, y=2. x=6 is less than 7, and not 0, so not wall. y=2 fine. Not in snake body positions, so safe.\n> \n> All three moves seem possible without immediate collision.\n> \n> But I need to think ahead for multiple turns.\n> \n> Also, food is at (5,5), which is above, with value 1.\n> \n> Life span 8, so it will disappear after 8 turns from now? Life span decreases each turn, including current. Current turn is 21, food has life span 8, meaning it will disappear after turn 21 + 8 - 1? Let's clarify.\n> \n> Life span N: disappears after N turns. Countdown decreases every turn, including current.\n> \n> So at turn t, if food has life span L, it will be there for L more turns, including turn t. So it disappears after turn t + L - 1? Let's think.\n> \n> For example, if at turn t, life span L, then:\n> \n> - At turn t: life span L, can be eaten\n> \n> - Turn t+1: life span L-1, if L-1>0, still there\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - Turn t + L - 1: life span 1, still there\n> \n> - Turn t + L: not there anymore.\n> \n> So for food at (5,5), turn 21, life span 8, so it will be there from turn 21 to turn 28 inclusive? Turn 21: L=8, turn 22: L=7, ..., turn 28: L=1, turn 29: gone. So available until turn 28.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (5,2), food at (5,5). So same x, different y. Distance is 3 in y-direction.\n> \n> To reach (5,5) from (5,2), I need to move up 3 times.\n> \n> But there might be obstacles or risks.\n> \n> Also, the snake body is currently occupying cells; I need to make sure the path is clear.\n> \n> Current position: head at (5,2), moving up would go to (5,3), then to (5,4), then to (5,5) in three moves.\n> \n> But is (5,3) safe? From above, it's not occupied now.\n> \n> After moving to (5,3), the snake body will move. When snake moves, the head moves to new position, and each segment follows, so the tail moves away.\n> \n> Current snake positions: head (5,2), then (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), tail (2,4).\n> \n> If I move up to (5,3), new head: (5,3), then the body: previous head becomes part of body, so (5,2) now segment 1, (5,1) segment 2, and so on, up to (2,3) segment 9, and (2,4) is tail, but since head moved, tail moves off (2,4), so (2,4) becomes empty? Let's trace.\n> \n> After move U:\n> \n> - New head: (5,3)\n> \n> - Then body: (5,2) [previous head], (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3)  // (2,4) is not part anymore, since tail moved. The tail was (2,4), but when snake moves forward, the tail segment is removed, so cells are freed except the new head position.\n> \n> Positions after move U:\n> \n> - Head: (5,3)\n> \n> - Segment 1: (5,2)  // previous head\n> \n> - Segment 2: (5,1)  // previous segment 1\n> \n> - Segment 3: (4,1)  // previous segment 2\n> \n> - Segment 4: (3,1)  // previous segment 3\n> \n> - Segment 5: (2,1)  // previous segment 4\n> \n> - Segment 6: (1,1)  // previous segment 5\n> \n> - Segment 7: (1,2)  // previous segment 6\n> \n> - Segment 8: (2,2)  // previous segment 7\n> \n> - Segment 9: (2,3)  // previous segment 8, and (2,4) is gone.\n> \n> (2,4) was the tail, so it moves off, so (2,4) is empty now.\n> \n> Similarly, for other moves.\n> \n> Back to reaching food: from (5,2) to (5,5) in three moves up: U, U, U.\n> \n> But after each move, the snake body changes, so I need to ensure that when I move to (5,3), it's safe, then to (5,4), safe, then to (5,5) safe.\n> \n> First, move to (5,3): as above, not occupied.\n> \n> Then from there, if I move U to (5,4): (5,4) – is it occupied? After first move, positions: head (5,3), body (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), ..., (2,3). (5,4) not in list, so safe.\n> \n> Then move U to (5,5): (5,5) has food, but I need to check if it's safe to eat.\n> \n> When head moves to (5,5), it eats the food, so snake grows: head moves to (5,5), and the tail doesn't move, so new segment is added.\n> \n> But is there any collision? (5,5) is not occupied by body at that time.\n> \n> After moving to (5,4), positions: head (5,4), body: (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2)  // and tail is (2,3)? Let's list:\n> \n> After two moves U:\n> \n> Start: turn 21, positions: [(5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4)]\n> \n> After turn 21 move U: head to (5,3), body: (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3)  // (2,4) gone\n> \n> After turn 22, move U again: head to (5,4), body: (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2)  // (2,3) gone\n> \n> Now, (2,3) was tail, gone.\n> \n> Now, move to (5,5) on turn 23: head to (5,5), which has food. Since it's positive food, snake grows: so head moves to (5,5), and tail does not move, so new positions: head (5,5), then (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2)  // and since grown, the tail was (2,2), now it stays, and new segment is added? When snake eats, the tail doesn't move, so the segment that was about to be removed stays.\n> \n> After move to (5,5) and eating:\n> \n> - Head: (5,5)\n> \n> - New segment: the previous tail position is kept, so body: (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2)  // and since grown, (2,2) is still there, and now the snake has 11 segments.\n> \n> Previously before eating, after moving to (5,4), positions were: head (5,4), and body segments down to (2,2), which was the last segment before tail movement. In the list above, after two moves, positions: [(5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2)] — that's 10 segments, with (2,2) as tail.\n> \n> When head moves to (5,5) and eats, the tail doesn't move, so the snake becomes: head (5,5), then (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2) — 11 segments, with (2,2) as tail.\n> \n> Now, is (5,5) safe? At the time of move, before moving, (5,5) is not occupied by body, since body is at (5,4) down to (2,2), all different positions. (5,5) is free, so no collision.\n> \n> Also, no wall, so safe to eat.\n> \n> This would take 3 turns: turn 21 U, turn 22 U, turn 23 U to reach and eat food at (5,5).\n> \n> Food life span 8, from turn 21, available until turn 28, so turn 23 is fine.\n> \n> But I need to think beyond that for survival.\n> \n> Also, there might be risks or better options.\n> \n> First, let's consider the current possible moves and think ahead.\n> \n> Since head direction is U, I can move U, L, or R.\n> \n> Moving U directly towards food seems good, but let's see the board.\n> \n> The snake body is coiled; from (5,2) to (5,1) down, then left to (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), then up to (1,1), (1,2), then right to (2,2), up to (2,3), (2,4). So it's like the snake is in the bottom left area, with head at (5,2).\n> \n> Food at (5,5), so moving up is direct.\n> \n> But moving left or right might be safer or lead to other paths.\n> \n> Also, I need to consider the tail reward danger.\n> \n> In this case, when eating food, is the head adjacent to tail? After eating, tail is at (2,2), head at (5,5), not adjacent, so no issue.\n> \n> Tail reward danger is only if head is adjacent to tail and tail has food, but here tail doesn't have food, so fine.\n> \n> Now, another thing: after eating, the snake is longer, and I need to avoid dead ends.\n> \n> Let me sketch the grid mentally.\n> \n> Grid 8x8, but walls at borders, so playable area 1-6 in x and y? x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (1,6).\n> \n> Current snake positions:\n> \n> - (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4)\n> \n> So occupied cells: bottom row y=1: (5,1),(4,1),(3,1),(2,1),(1,1) — that's x=1 to5 y=1\n> \n> Then (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4) and head (5,2)\n> \n> (5,2) is head.\n> \n> Free cells: for example, (3,2), (4,2), (5,3), (6,2), (6,1) but y=1 has snake at x=1-5, so (6,1) free, etc.\n> \n> Food at (5,5).\n> \n> Now, if I move up three times, I eat the food, as above.\n> \n> But after that, snake is at (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2)\n> \n> With tail at (2,2).\n> \n> Now, from (5,5), I need to find safe moves. Possible directions: after moving U multiple times, head direction would be U, so I can move U, L, R, not D.\n> \n> Moving U to (5,6): but y=6, is it wall? y=7 is wall, y=6 should be free? Walls are at y=0 and y=7, so y=6 is within 1-6, so free. But internal obstacle? (1,6) is obstacle, but (5,6) not, so (5,6) should be free.\n> \n> After eating, positions: head at (5,5), body at (5,4) down to (5,1), then (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2)\n> \n> (5,6) is free, I think.\n> \n> Similarly, L to (4,5), R to (6,5), D to (5,4) but (5,4) is body, so if move D, collision.\n> \n> After head at (5,5), if I move D to (5,4), but (5,4) is the first body segment, so collision, death.\n> \n> Cannot move down.\n> \n> So from (5,5) with direction U, can move U, L, R.\n> \n> U to (5,6): should be free.\n> \n> L to (4,5): let's see if occupied.

(5,5) efficiently, gaining +1 score and increasing length, then moved left and down to avoid the top wall and access open space for better maneuverability and long-term survival.

It's turn 22, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid (since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so cells from (0,0) to (7,7) probably, but walls are at the borders, so playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6)? Let me confirm.\n> \n> Walls: Border cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (1,6). So, the grid is 8x8, but the borders are walls, so the snake can only move within x=1 to x=6 and y=1 to y=6, except where obstacles are.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (1,6), so that cell is blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions: Head is at (5,3), then body: (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3). So the snake has 10 segments. Head direction is Up, meaning it moved to (5,3) from below, since previous position was (5,2), which is down from (5,3)? Let's list the positions in order:\n> \n> - Head: (5,3)\n> \n> - Then (5,2) — directly below\n> \n> - (5,1) — below that\n> \n> - (4,1) — left, since x decreased\n> \n> - (3,1) — left\n> \n> - (2,1) — left\n> \n> - (1,1) — left\n> \n> - (1,2) — up, since y increased\n> \n> - (2,2) — right\n> \n> - Tail: (2,3) — up from (2,2)? (2,2) to (2,3) is up.\n> \n> The positions are given in order: head first to tail last. So from head to tail: (5,3) -> (5,2) -> (5,1) -> (4,1) -> (3,1) -> (2,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (2,2) -> (2,3). So the tail is at (2,3).\n> \n> Now, head direction is U, which means it's facing Up. Last move was to (5,3), and since it came from (5,2), which is below, so moving up to (5,3) makes sense, direction U.\n> \n> Food:\n> \n> - (5,5) with life span 7, value +1 (positive food)\n> \n> - (4,6) with life span 10, value +1 (positive food)\n> \n> Both are positive food, no negative food mentioned.\n> \n> Life span: for (5,5), life span 7, meaning it disappears after 7 turns from now? The countdown decreases every turn including current, so at turn 22, life span 7, so it will be gone by turn 29 if not eaten. Similarly, (4,6) life span 10, gone by turn 32.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan an action sequence for at least 5 turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n> \n> First, let's sketch the grid for clarity.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7, but walls at borders, so playable area: x=1 to 6, y=1 to6, except (1,6) is obstacle.\n> \n> Obstacle at (1,6), so that cell is blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions:\n> \n> - (5,3) head\n> \n> - (5,2)\n> \n> - (5,1)\n> \n> - (4,1)\n> \n> - (3,1)\n> \n> - (2,1)\n> \n> - (1,1)\n> \n> - (1,2)\n> \n> - (2,2)\n> \n> - (2,3) tail\n> \n> Food at (5,5) and (4,6)\n> \n> Head at (5,3), direction U (up).\n> \n> Possible moves: U, D, L, R, but cannot reverse instantly. Since direction is U, reverse would be D, so cannot move down immediately. Also, need to avoid walls, obstacles, and body collisions except for tail under certain conditions.\n> \n> Current possible moves from (5,3):\n> \n> - Up (U): to (5,4)\n> \n> - Down (D): but reverse, not allowed? Direction is U, so moving down would be opposite, so not allowed. Rule: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\"\n> \n> So from current direction U, cannot move D to (5,2), but (5,2) is occupied by body anyway, so it's invalid regardless.\n> \n> - Left (L): to (4,3)\n> \n> - Right (R): to (6,3)\n> \n> Now, check if these are valid:\n> \n> (5,4): is it within bounds? x=5, y=4. y=1 to 6 is playable, since walls at y=0 and y=7. y=4 is between 1 and 6, so ok. No obstacle at (5,4), I think. Obstacles are only border walls and (1,6), so (5,4) should be free.\n> \n> (4,3): similarly, x=4, y=3, within bounds, no obstacle.\n> \n> (6,3): x=6, y=3, x=6 is playable? Walls at x=0 and x=7, so x=1 to 6 should be playable. y=0 and y=7 walls, but y=3 is fine. So (6,3) should be free.\n> \n> Now, are there any body segments at these positions? Let's list all occupied cells by snake:\n> \n> (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3)\n> \n> So (5,4) is not occupied, (4,3) not occupied, (6,3) not occupied. So all three moves are possible in terms of space.\n> \n> But need to think long-term.\n> \n> Food is at (5,5) and (4,6). (5,5) is two steps up from head? Head at (5,3), so up to (5,4), then up to (5,5). (4,6) is at x=4,y=6.\n> \n> y=6 is the top row, since y=7 is wall, so y=6 is playable but adjacent to wall.\n> \n> Similarly, x=4,y=6.\n> \n> Now, life spans: (5,5) life 7, so must be eaten by turn 28? Turn 22 now, life span decreases each turn including current, so after turn 22, life span becomes 6, then 5, etc., down to 0. When life span reaches 0, it disappears. So if life span is S at turn T, it disappears at turn T + S - 1? Let's clarify.\n> \n> Rule: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So at turn t, food has life span L, it means after this turn, L decreases by 1, and it exists as long as L > 0.\n> \n> So for (5,5), life span 7 at turn 22. After turn 22, it becomes 6. After turn 23, 5, ..., after turn 28, it becomes 0, and disappears before turn 29. So it can be eaten from turn 22 to 28 inclusive.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,6) life span 10, from turn 22 to 31 inclusive.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan a sequence of moves for at least 5 turns: turn 22, 23, 24, 25, 26.\n> \n> But since I need to think 5+ turns ahead, I should consider how to get to the food safely.\n> \n> Also, there's a risk with tail: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it might kill because of collision.\n> \n> First, let's see where the tail is. Tail is at (2,3). Is there food on tail? The food positions are (5,5) and (4,6), neither is on tail, so no issue for now. But after moving, tail might move, and if food is eaten, tail grows, etc.\n> \n> Currently, no food on snake body except possibly, but food can spawn under body, but here food is given at (5,5) and (4,6), which are not occupied by snake, I think.\n> \n> Snake occupies: (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3)\n> \n> (5,5) is free, (4,6) is free. So no food under snake.\n> \n> Now, to eat (5,5), I can go up twice: from (5,3) to (5,4), then to (5,5). But need to check if that's safe.\n> \n> First, move from turn 22: from (5,3), I can go U, L, or R.\n> \n> If I go U to (5,4), then on turn 23, from (5,4) direction U, I can go U to (5,5) to eat the food.\n> \n> But when I eat at (5,5), the snake grows, so after eating, the tail doesn't move, so the new segment is added at head, so positions: after moving to (5,5), head is there, and since it ate, length increases, so tail stays, so the body includes all previous positions plus new head.\n> \n> But when moving, the tail moves only if no food eaten.\n> \n> Rule: when eating positive food, length +1, so after moving to food cell, the snake grows, meaning the tail segment doesn't move off, so the new position is added, and tail remains.\n> \n> For example, if head moves to food, it stays there, and the segment that was tail doesn't move, so snake gets longer.\n> \n> In terms of positions, when head moves to a new cell, if it eats food, the tail stays, so positions list gains one cell at head.\n> \n> If no food, tail moves off, so positions: head moves to new, all segments shift, tail removed.\n> \n> In this case, if I go to (5,5) on turn 23, I eat the food, so snake grows to 11 segments.\n> \n> But before that, on turn 22, if I move to (5,4), no food there, so just move.\n> \n> Let's simulate turn by turn.\n> \n> Turn 22: current head (5,3), direction U.\n> \n> Option 1: Move U to (5,4)\n> \n> After move: head at (5,4), direction U (since moved up). Body: (5,3) becomes part of body, and so on, tail at (2,3) moves off? Since no food eaten, the tail moves off.\n> \n> When snake moves without eating, the head moves to new position, and tail is removed.\n> \n> So after turn 22 move U:\n> \n> - New head: (5,4)\n> \n> - Body: (5,3) (now first body segment), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2) — and tail (2,3) is removed? Positions: previous positions were 10 segments. After move, head moves to (5,4), so the list becomes: [(5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2)] — since tail (2,3) is removed, and (2,2) is now the new tail? Let's see the sequence.\n> \n> Original positions: index 0: (5,3) head, 1: (5,2), 2: (5,1), 3: (4,1), 4: (3,1), 5: (2,1), 6: (1,1), 7: (1,2), 8: (2,2), 9: (2,3) tail.\n> \n> After moving head to (5,4) without eating: new head at (5,4), then body: previous head (5,3) becomes first body, so positions: (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2) — and (2,3) is removed, so tail is now (2,2).\n> \n> Yes, 10 segments still.\n> \n> Now direction is U.\n> \n> Turn 23: from (5,4), I can move U to (5,5) to eat the food there.\n> \n> After moving to (5,5), it eats the positive food, so snake grows: head at (5,5), and tail does not move, so positions: (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2) — now 11 segments, tail at (2,2).\n> \n> Direction U.\n> \n> Now, after eating, I have score +1.\n> \n> But I need to think about the future.

It's turn 23. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and an internal obstacle at (1,6).

So the snake is 10 segments long. Head direction is Up (U), meaning it was moving upwards last turn.\n> \n> Food: There are two food items:\n> \n> - At (5,5) with value +1 and life span 6 turns. So it will disappear after turn 23 + 6 = turn 29? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 23, life span is 6, meaning it has 6 turns left including this one. After 6 turns, on turn 29, it should be gone, but let's confirm.\n> \n> Life span: disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current.

When snake eats, it grows, so after moving to food, the tail stays in place, so snake length increases.\n> \n> Standard snake: when you eat food, you move head to food, add a new segment, but tail doesn't move that turn. So positions: new head at food, then previous head, body, and tail remains.\n> \n> In this case, if move U to (5,5), eat food, so snake becomes: [(5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2)] but since we ate, we add a segment? No.\n> \n> When snake eats, after moving head to food, the tail does not move, so the new position is head at food, and the body includes the previous head and all, but tail stays, so length increases by one.\n> \n> Initial positions: 10 segments.\n> \n> After move without eating: head moves to new position, each body segment moves to previous position, tail leaves its position.\n> \n> But when eating: head moves to food, body segments move as usual, but tail does not move, so the cell where tail was is now occupied by the new segment, and a new segment is added at the tail position? I think I'm confusing.\n> \n> Standard: when snake moves to a cell without food, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, tail is removed from its cell.\n> \n> When snake moves to a cell with food, head moves to food, body segments move as usual, but tail does not move, so the snake grows by one, and the tail cell remains occupied.\n> \n> In terms of positions: after eating, the new positions are [new_head] + previous positions, so the list has one more element.\n> \n> For example, here: current snake: positions list, head first.\n> \n> After moving to (5,5) and eating, new snake: head at (5,5), then the previous head (5,4) becomes neck, and so on, down to tail (2,2), and since we ate, we don't remove the tail, so the snake now has 11 segments: (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2).\n> \n> (2,2) is still the tail for now.\n> \n> Then on next move, if we don't eat, tail will move.\n> \n> But in this case, no issue with tail reward danger since head not near tail.\n> \n> Now, back to choices.\n> \n> I could move L to (4,4) or R to (6,4), avoiding the food for now.\n> \n> But I need to think long-term.\n> \n> There's another food at (4,6) with life span 9, so plenty of time.\n> \n> Food at (5,5) has only 6 turns life, including current, so if I don't eat it soon, it might disappear.\n> \n> Life span 6 at turn 23: available until turn 28, since on turn 29 it disappears.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,6) life span 9, available until turn 31.\n> \n> But I should eat (5,5) if possible.\n> \n> But let's see the grid and possible paths.\n> \n> Also, I need to avoid colliding with walls or body.\n> \n> Now, let's simulate possible moves.\n> \n> First, option: move U to (5,5) on turn 23.\n> \n> Then head at (5,5), direction U.\n> \n> Food eaten, so snake grows to 11 segments.\n> \n> Now, for turn 24, head at (5,5), direction U (since we moved U).\n> \n> Possible moves: U, L, R.

Walls are at y=0 and y=7, so y=6 is fine, no wall. Also not snake, not food? Food was at (5,5) eaten, so gone. (4,6) is food, but (5,6) is empty. So U to (5,6) possible.\n> \n> - L: to (4,5).

Snake positions: let's list all: (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2). None at (5,6), so (5,6) is empty and safe to move to? But after moving, the snake will move, so I need to check if moving to (5,6) causes collision.\n> \n> When snake moves, head goes to new position, and each segment moves to the next position, tail moves away, so only if head hits a body segment that is not the tail.\n> \n> Specifically, collision if head moves to a cell occupied by any body segment except the current tail, because the tail will move, so if head moves to tail position, it's ok only if tail moves away, but in the next state, the tail moves, so head can move to where tail was, and it's safe because tail leaves that cell.\n> \n> Rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, moving to tail position is safe because tail moves away.\n> \n> Now, for (5,6): not occupied by any snake body except possibly tail? Tail is at (2,2), not (5,6). Body segments: (5,4) to (2,2), all different positions. So (5,6) is free, so moving U to (5,6) is safe.\n> \n> - Move L to (4,5): what is at (4,5)? Snake positions: head is at (5,5), so (4,5) is not head. Body: (5,4), (5,3), etc., no (4,5) in list, so (4,5) is free? Let's see: positions are (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2). (4,5) is not in this list, so it should be empty. Also, not a wall, so moving L to (4,5) is possible.\n> \n> - Move R to (6,5): similarly, (6,5) not in snake positions, not wall (x=6<7, y=5>0), so free, safe.\n> \n> All three moves seem possible immediately. But I need to think ahead for food and survival.\n> \n> There's food at (4,6) with value +1, life span 8 turns. I should consider going for it, but not immediately if risky.\n> \n> First, where is (4,6)? From (5,5), to reach (4,6), I need to go left and up, but (4,6) is adjacent? (5,5) to (4,6) is not adjacent; adjacent cells are (5,6), (4,5), (6,5), (5,4). (5,4) is behind, cannot go down since direction U, and reverse not allowed.\n> \n> (4,6) is at x=4, y=6. From (5,5), (4,6) is diagonally, not directly adjacent. So I need multiple moves to reach it.\n> \n> Possible paths to (4,6):\n> \n> - If I go U to (5,6), then from there, I can go L to (4,6)? From (5,6), moving L would go to (4,6), which is the food.\n> \n> (5,6) to (4,6) is left, so yes.\n> \n> - From (5,5), if I go L to (4,5), then from (4,5), I can go U to (4,6)? (4,5) to (4,6) is up.\n> \n> So both ways can reach food in two moves.\n> \n> But if I go U first to (5,6), then L to (4,6), eating food on turn 25 or something.\n> \n> Similarly, if I go L first to (4,5), then U to (4,6).\n> \n> Now, I need to see if it's safe and if there are risks.\n> \n> Also, there's a special rule: Tail Reward Danger. If head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> But here, tail is at (2,2), far away, not adjacent to head or food, so no issue.\n> \n> Now, life span is 8, plenty of time, so I don't have to rush.\n> \n> But I should think about the board state.\n> \n> The snake is long, 11 segments, so the board is getting crowded.\n> \n> Playable area: x 1-6, y 1-6, minus (1,6) wall, so total cells: 6x6=36 minus one wall, 35 cells? x from 1 to 6 inclusive, that's 6 cells, y from 1 to 6 inclusive, 6 cells, so 36 cells. Minus internal wall at (1,6), so 35 free cells. Snake occupies 11, so 24 free cells, but with food at (4,6), which is free now.\n> \n> After moving, snake will occupy head new position, and tail may move away.\n> \n> Now, let's simulate possible actions.\n> \n> First, I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> Also, after eating food, snake grows, so length increases, which might make it harder to maneuver.\n> \n> But since food is positive, +1 length.\n> \n> Now, let's consider the sequence.\n> \n> Option 1: Go for food directly.\n> \n> If I move U to (5,6) on turn 24.\n> \n> Then on turn 25, from (5,6), I can move L to (4,6) to eat food.\n> \n> But when I move to (4,6), I eat the food, so snake grows: new head at (4,6), and tail doesn't move, so length increases by one.\n> \n> Sequence:\n> \n> Turn 24: Move U to (5,6)\n> \n> Snake now: head at (5,6), body: (5,5), (5,4), ..., up to tail (2,2). Positions: after moving, head moves to (5,6), then the body segments follow: the segment that was at (5,5) moves to where head was? No.\n> \n> When snake moves, the head goes to the new cell, and each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment. So the segment that was at position i moves to position i-1.\n> \n> Initial positions: index 0: head (5,5), 1: (5,4), 2: (5,3), 3: (5,2), 4: (5,1), 5: (4,1), 6: (3,1), 7: (2,1), 8: (1,1), 9: (1,2), 10: (2,2) tail.\n> \n> After move U: head moves to (5,6), so new head is (5,6). Then segment at index 1 (was (5,4)) moves to where head was, (5,5). Index 2 (was (5,3)) moves to where index 1 was, (5,4), and so on. Index 10 (tail at (2,2)) moves to where index 9 was, (1,2).\n> \n> After move, snake: head (5,6), then (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2). Tail is now at (1,2)? Index 9 was (1,2), so tail moves to (1,2), but index 9 was (1,2), and index 10 moves to that position, so new position 1: (5,6), position 2: (5,5), position 3: (5,4), ..., position 10: (1,1) (was index 8), position 11: (1,2) (was index 9, now tail).\n> \n> List:\n> \n> - Head: (5,6)\n> \n> - Body: segment 1: (5,5)  // previous head\n> \n> - Segment 2: (5,4)  // previous segment 1\n> \n> - Segment 3: (5,3)  // previous segment 2\n> \n> - Segment 4: (5,2)  // previous segment 3\n> \n> - Segment 5: (5,1)  // previous segment 4\n> \n> - Segment 6: (4,1)  // previous segment 5\n> \n> - Segment 7: (3,1)  // previous segment 6\n> \n> - Segment 8: (2,1)  // previous segment 7\n> \n> - Segment 9: (1,1)  // previous segment 8\n> \n> - Segment 10: (1,2)  // previous segment 9, now tail\n> \n> Tail was at (2,2), which is gone, moved to (1,2).\n> \n> Now, on turn 25, from (5,6), I can move L to (4,6).\n> \n> (4,6) has food, so I eat it. When eating, head moves to (4,6), and since it's food, the tail does not move, so snake grows by one segment.\n> \n> New head at (4,6), and the previous body segments stay, with an additional segment at the tail end? No.\n> \n> Standard snake: when you eat food, head moves to food cell, and a new segment is added at the tail position, so tail doesn't move, length increases.\n> \n> So positions: after moving to (4,6) and eating, head is (4,6), then the body is: previous head position (5,6), then (5,5), (5,4), ..., down to (1,1), and tail remains (1,2) because it didn't move? Let's see.\n> \n> Before move: snake positions: (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2)\n> \n> After move L to (4,6): head moves to (4,6). Then, since eating food, tail does not move, so the body segments: segment 1 moves to (5,6) but head was at (5,6), so segment 1 should move to where head was, but head is moving to new position. When head moves to new cell, the first body segment moves to the old head position, and so on, but when eating, the tail doesn't advance, so the last segment stays.\n> \n> So new positions: head at (4,6)\n> \n> Body: the segment that was at position 1 ( (5,5) ) moves to the old head position (5,6)? Positions:\n> \n> - Head new: (4,6)\n> \n> - Body segment 1: old head position (5,6)\n> \n> - Body segment 2: old segment 1 position (5,5)\n> \n> - Body segment 3: old segment 2 position (5,4)\n> \n> - ...\n> - Body segment 10: old segment 9 position (1,1)\n> \n> - Body segment 11: old segment 10 position (1,2)  // this is the tail, and since eating, tail doesn't move, so it stays, and a new segment is added? No, the tail segment stays, and length increases.\n> \n> After eating, the snake has the same segments plus a new one at the tail end.\n> \n> But in terms of positions, after moving head to new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, but for the tail, if not eating, it moves to the previous position of the second last; if eating, it stays put.\n> \n> So here: after moving to (4,6), the body segments move: segment 1 moves to (5,6), segment 2 moves to (5,5), segment 3 to (5,4), ..., segment 10 moves to (1,1) (old position of segment 9), and segment 11 (tail) would normally move to old position of segment 10, but since eating, it doesn't move, so it stays at (1,2), and a new segment is added at the tail, so now there is an additional segment at (1,2), but the tail was already there, it's confusing.\n> \n> Perhaps it's better to think that the tail position remains the same, and a new segment is added there.\n> \n> But in position list, the tail cell is occupied, and when not eating, tail moves away, freeing the cell; when eating, tail stays, so the cell is not freed.\n> \n> In this case, before move, positions include (1,2).\n> \n> After moving head to (4,6), and body shifts: the segment that was at index 1 moves to index 0's old position (5,6), index 2 moves to index 1's old position (5,5), ..., index 10 moves to index 9's old position (1,1), and since eating, the tail (index 10) does not move, so it stays at (1,2), and now there is an additional segment at the end, so the new tail is at (1,2) with the new segment.\n> \n> Positions: head (4,6), then (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), and tail at (1,2). Length 12 now.\n> \n> (1,1) is now a body segment, and (1,2) is tail.\n> \n> But (1,1) was occupied by segment 9 before, now segment 10 moves to it, and tail at (1,2).\n> \n> Anyway, for collision, I need to see if (4,6) is safe to move to.\n> \n> On turn 25, from (5,6), moving L to (4,6).\n> \n> (4,6) is not a wall, and not occupied by any snake body at that time? Before move, snake positions are (5,6), (5,5), etc., as above, no (4,6), so it should be free, and food is there, so I can eat it.\n> \n> But is there any risk? (4,6) is at y=6, which is the top row, since y=7 is wall, so y=6 is playable but border is close.\n> \n> Also, internal obstacle at (1,6), but (4,6) is fine.\n> \n> After eating, snake is at (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), ..., down to (1,1), (1,2).\n> \n> Now, the head is at (4,6), which is cornered a bit; possible moves from there: U, D, L, R, but U to (4,7) is wall, y=7 wall, so cannot move U.\n> \n> D to (4,5), L to (3,6), R to (5,6) but (5,6) is the body segment right behind, so moving R to (5,6) would be collision because (5,6) is occupied by the first body segment.\n> \n> Positions: head at (4,6), body segment 1 at (5,6), segment 2 at (5,5), etc.\n> \n> So if I move R to (5,6), that cell is occupied by segment 1, which is not the tail, so it's a body collision.\n> \n> Similarly, moving U is wall.\n> \n> So only possible moves from (4,6) are D to (4,5) or L to (3,6).\n> \n> L to (3,6): (3,6) is within bounds? x=3>0, y=6<7, not wall, and not occupied? Currently, snake is at (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), etc., no (3,6), so it should be free.\n> \n> Similarly, D to (4,5): (4,5) is free?

Playable cells: (1,1) to (6,6).\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (1,6).\n> \n> Snake body: Let's list all occupied cells:\n> \n> - (6,5) head\n> \n> - (5,5)\n> \n> - (5,4)\n> \n> - (5,3)\n> \n> - (5,2)\n> \n> - (5,1)\n> \n> - (4,1)\n> \n> - (3,1)\n> \n> - (2,1)\n> \n> - (1,1)\n> \n> - (1,2) tail\n> \n> Also, since the snake is moving, the tail will move when we move.\n> \n> Food at (4,6) and (6,3).\n> \n> (4,6) is at x=4, y=6. y=6 is one below the top wall y=7, since y=0 bottom, y=7 top? Let's confirm coordinates.\n> \n> Typically in grids, (0,0) might be bottom-left or top-left. But here, walls are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so probably (0,0) is bottom-left or top-left? The snake positions: head at (6,5), which is near top-right if y increases up.\n> \n> Snake positions: (1,1) to (1,2) to (2,1) etc., and (6,5). Also, (5,1) is bottom, since y=0 is wall, y=1 is playable.\n> \n> Assume y=0 is bottom, y=7 top? But walls are y=0 and y=7, so playable y from 1 to 6? Let's see the walls: \"Border cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7\" so cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. So playable area is x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6. x=1 to x=6, y=1 to y=6.\n> \n> In the snake positions, (5,1) has y=1, which is the bottom row, and (6,5) has y=5, which is higher, so probably y increases upwards, with y=1 bottom, y=6 top? y=6 is top because y=7 is wall.\n> \n> y=7 is wall, so y=6 is the top row, y=1 bottom row.\n> \n> Similarly, x=1 left, x=6 right.\n> \n> Head at (6,5), which is right side, near top.\n> \n> Tail at (1,2), left side.\n> \n> Food at (4,6): x=4, y=6, which is top row, center.\n> \n> Food at (6,3): x=6, y=3, which is right side, middle.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (1,6): x=1, y=6, top-left, but since it's an obstacle, snake can't go there.\n> \n> Now, current head direction is R (right), so from (6,5), moving right would go to (7,5), but x=7 is wall, so I cannot move right; it would be a wall collision.\n> \n> x=7 is wall, so from (6,5), moving right to (7,5) is impossible. Similarly, moving left to (5,5) is occupied by the body, but let's think carefully.\n> \n> Available moves from current position (6,5):\n> \n> - Up (U): (x,y+1) = (6,6)\n> \n> - Down (D): (x,y-1) = (6,4)\n> \n> - Left (L): (x-1,y) = (5,5)\n> \n> - Right (R): (x+1,y) = (7,5) — but x=7 is wall, so invalid.\n> \n> Also, Left to (5,5): (5,5) is occupied by the first body segment. But in snake, when moving, if you move to a cell that will be vacated by the tail, it might be ok, but here (5,5) is not the tail; it's the segment right behind the head.\n> \n> Collision rules: head touches any body segment except the tail, because the tail moves. So moving to (5,5) would be a body collision since (5,5) is occupied and will not be vacated immediately; only the tail moves when we eat food or after moving.\n> \n> Standard snake: when you move, the head moves to a new cell, and the tail moves one cell, so the cell that was tail is vacated. But if the head moves to a cell that is occupied by a body segment that isn't the tail, it collides.\n> \n> In this case, from (6,5), possible moves:\n> \n> - U to (6,6): is this free? (6,6) - let's see if occupied or wall.\n> \n> Walls: x=0,7 or y=0,7. (6,6) has x=6, y=6, both within 1-6, so not wall. Occupied? Snake positions: (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2). No (6,6), so (6,6) is free? But there might be food or something.\n> \n> Food is at (4,6) and (6,3), so (6,6) should be empty.\n> \n> But (6,6) is on the top row, y=6.\n> \n> - D to (6,4): (6,4) - not wall, not in snake positions? Positions: (5,4) is there, but (6,4) not listed, so should be free.\n> \n> (5,4) is occupied, but (6,4) is different cell.\n> \n> - L to (5,5): (5,5) is occupied by the first body segment.\n> \n> - R to (7,5): wall, invalid.\n> \n> So valid moves: U, D, L.\n> \n> But L to (5,5) is occupied, so if I move left to (5,5), since (5,5) is a body segment, and it's not the tail, it would be a collision. The tail is at (1,2), so moving to (5,5) would kill the snake.\n> \n> Similarly, moving to any body cell except the tail is deadly.\n> \n> But in this case, the tail is at (1,2), far away.\n> \n> So from (6,5), moving:\n> \n> - U to (6,6): possible, empty cell.\n> \n> - D to (6,4): possible, empty cell.\n> \n> - L to (5,5): occupied by body, collision, invalid.\n> \n> - R: wall, invalid.\n> \n> So only U and D are possible moves.\n> \n> Also, movement constraints: no instant reverse. Current direction is R (right), so opposite is L (left). Since L is invalid anyway, but even if it were, I couldn't move left immediately after moving right? No, \"no instant reverse\" means on the next turn, I cannot move opposite to current direction.\n> \n> Current direction is the direction the head is facing, which is given as \"R\".\n> \n> So for the next move, turn t1=25, I cannot move opposite to current direction, which is L (left). But since L is invalid anyway, it doesn't matter.\n> \n> Possible actions for turn 25: U or D.\n> \n> Now, I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n> \n> First, let's consider the food.\n> \n> Food at (4,6): value +1, life span 7, so it disappears after turn 25 + 7 - 1? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 25, life span 7, meaning it will disappear after 7 turns, so on turn 32 it will be gone? Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So at turn 25, life span 7, so after this turn (turn 25), countdown becomes 6, then 5, ..., down to 0, and disappears when countdown reaches 0, so it is present on turns where countdown >0.\n> \n> Countdown starts at N at the turn it appears, decreases each turn.\n> \n> For food at (4,6), at turn 25, life span 7, so it will be there until turn 31 (since after turn 31, countdown 0, gone). Turn 25: countdown 7, turn 26:6, ..., turn 31:1, then after turn 31, gone, so last chance to eat is turn 31.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (6,3): life span 10, at turn 25, so present until turn 34 (turn 25:10, 26:9, ..., 34:1, gone after 34).\n> \n> Now, I need to plan a sequence for at least 5 turns, but I should aim to eat food while avoiding risks.\n> \n> Also, special case: food can spawn under body, but here both foods are not under body, I think.\n> \n> (4,6): is it under snake? Snake positions: no (4,6), so free.\n> \n> (6,3): snake has (5,3) and (6,5), etc., no (6,3), so free.\n> \n> Tail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills. But tail is at (1,2), far, not adjacent to head. Head at (6,5), tail at (1,2), not adjacent.\n> \n> Now, current moves: from (6,5), I can go U to (6,6) or D to (6,4).\n> \n> Let's simulate both options.\n> \n> First, if I go U to (6,6) on turn 25.\n> \n> Then head moves to (6,6), and since no food there, snake doesn't grow, so tail moves. Tail is at (1,2), and when we move, tail moves to the next segment or something. Standard snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, and if not eating food, the tail moves one cell towards the head direction, but actually, the tail follows the path.\n> \n> Since positions are a list, after moving head to (6,6), the new positions: head at (6,6), then the body: previous head (6,5) becomes first segment, then (5,5), (5,4), ..., up to (1,1), and tail (1,2) is removed? Let's think.\n> \n> Current positions: index 0: head (6,5), 1: (5,5), 2: (5,4), 3: (5,3), 4: (5,2), 5: (5,1), 6: (4,1), 7: (3,1), 8: (2,1), 9: (1,1), 10: (1,2) tail.\n> \n> After moving head to (6,6), new head at (6,6), then the body segments shift: segment 1 becomes (6,5), segment 2 becomes (5,5), ..., segment 10 becomes (1,1), and tail segment 11 is removed, so tail is now at (1,1)? Positions: new list: [ (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1) ] so tail is at (1,1).\n> \n> Similarly, if I move down to (6,4), new head (6,4), body [ (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1) ], tail at (1,1)? After moving down to (6,4), positions: head (6,4), then (6,5) (previous head), then (5,5), (5,4), ..., but (5,4) is current segment 2, but after shift, it should be: new segment 1: old head (6,5), new segment 2: old segment 1 (5,5), new segment 3: old segment 2 (5,4), and so on, up to old segment 9 (1,1), and old tail (1,2) is removed.

So cells from x=1 to x=6 and y=1 to y=6 are inside, but with an internal obstacle at (1,6). Snake positions start from (6,6) down to (1,1). Head is at (6,6) with direction U, which is up. But up from (6,6) would be y+1, so (6,7), but y=7 is a wall, so moving up is impossible? That can't be right.\n> \n> Snake positions: [(6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1)] Head direction is U. But (6,6) with U would go to (6,7), which is y=7, a wall. So moving up is invalid because it's a wall collision. Similarly, moving left might be possible, or down, but head direction is U, so I need to consider possible moves.\n> \n> Head direction is given as U, but since the snake is at (6,6), moving U to (6,7) is wall. So I must avoid that. Also, no instant reverse, so since head direction is U, I cannot move D (down) immediately, because that would be opposite.\n> \n> Current head direction is U, so possible moves are U, L, R, but not D, because D is opposite to U.

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State\n\nFirst, let's summarize the current state of the game at Turn 27:\n\n- **Grid Dimensions**: The game is played on an 8x8 grid with coordinates ranging from (0,0) to (7,7). The borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, and there's an internal obstacle at (1,6).\n  \n- **Snake Position**: The snake's body is represented as a list starting from the head:\n  - Head: (5,6)\n  - Body: [(6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1)]\n  - Length: 11 segments\n  - Current direction: Left (L), meaning the snake was moving left to reach (5,6) from (6,6).\n\n- **Food**:\n  - (4,6): Value = +1, Life span = 5 (will disappear after Turn 32)\n  - (6,3): Value = +1, Life span = 8 (will disappear after Turn 35)\n\n### Possible Moves at Turn 27\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However, there are constraints:\n\n1. **No Instant Reverse**: Since the current direction is Left (L), the opposite direction Right (R) is not allowed in the next move.\n2. **Wall Collision**: Cannot move into cells that are walls.\n3. **Body Collision**: Cannot move into cells occupied by the snake's body (except the tail, under certain conditions).\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move from the head's current position (5,6):\n\n1. **Up (U)**: (5,6) → (5,7)\n   - (5,7) is at y=7, which is a wall. **Invalid**.\n\n2. **Down (D)**: (5,6) → (5,5)\n   - (5,5) is occupied by the snake's body (4th segment). **Invalid**.\n\n3. **Left (L)**: (5,6) → (4,6)\n   - (4,6) is not a wall and not occupied by the snake's body (only has food). **Valid**.\n\n4. **Right (R)**: (5,6) → (6,6)\n   - (6,6) is occupied by the snake's body (2nd segment). Also, it's the opposite of the current direction. **Invalid**.\n\n**Conclusion**: The only valid move at Turn 27 is **Left (L)** to (4,6).\n\n### Verifying the Move to (4,6)\n\nMoving to (4,6) means the snake will eat the food there because:\n\n- The cell (4,6) contains positive food (+1).\n- The head moves onto the food cell, and the body was not previously on it (since the snake was at (5,6) and (6,6), etc., not (4,6)).\n\nAfter eating:\n- **Score increases by +1**.\n- **Snake length increases by 1** (from 11 to 12).\n- The food at (4,6) is consumed and will disappear.\n\nNew snake positions after move:\n- Head moves to (4,6).\n- The body grows by adding the previous head (5,6) at the start of the body list.\n- The tail does not move because the snake grew (eating food means the tail stays in place).\n\nNew positions:\n[(4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1)]\n\n### Potential Risks After Moving to (4,6)\n\nAfter moving to (4,6), we need to ensure that the next moves don't lead to a collision. Specifically:\n\n- **Tail Reward Danger**: If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it would cause the head and new tail to collide. \n  - Current tail is at (2,1), which is not adjacent to (4,6). No risk here.\n  \n- **Body Collision**: Moving into any body segment other than the tail is deadly.\n  \n- **Wall Collision**: Moving into any wall is deadly.\n\n### Next Possible Moves After Turn 27\n\nAt Turn 28, the snake's head is at (4,6), direction is Left (L). Possible moves:\n\n1. **Up (U)**: (4,6) → (4,7)\n   - (4,7) is a wall (y=7). **Invalid**.\n\n2. **Down (D)**: (4,6) → (4,5)\n   - (4,5) is not occupied by the snake's body (current body: starts with (5,6), etc., (4,5) is free). **Valid**.\n\n3. **Left (L)**: (4,6) → (3,6)\n   - (3,6) is not a wall and not occupied by the snake's body. **Valid**.\n\n4. **Right (R)**: (4,6) → (5,6)\n   - (5,6) is the second segment of the body. Also, opposite of current direction (L). **Invalid**.\n\n**Valid Moves at Turn 28**: Down (D) to (4,5) or Left (L) to (3,6).\n\n### Choosing Between Down (D) and Left (L) at Turn 28\n\nWe need to choose a move that maximizes the chance to reach the other food at (6,3) safely.\n\n**Option 1: Down (D) to (4,5)**\n- New head: (4,5)\n- No food at (4,5), so the tail moves forward (snake does not grow).\n- New positions: head (4,5), then (4,6), (5,6), etc., tail (3,1) moves off, new tail is (4,1).\n\nFrom (4,5), possible next moves would be Down to (4,4) or Left to (3,5), etc.\n\n**Option 2: Left (L) to (3,6)**\n- New head: (3,6)\n- No food at (3,6), tail moves.\n- New positions: head (3,6), then (4,6), (5,6), etc., tail (3,1) moves off, new tail is (4,1).\n\nFrom (3,6), possible next moves would be Down to (3,5) or Left to (2,6).\n\n**Path to (6,3)**:\nTo reach (6,3), we need to move right and down. Starting by moving left seems to take us away from (6,3). Moving down first might be better to start descending towards the food's row (y=3).\n\n**Choosing Down (D) at Turn 28** seems more promising to eventually reach (6,3).\n\n### Subsequent Moves After Turn 28 (D to (4,5))\n\nAt Turn 29, head at (4,5), direction Down (D). Possible moves:\n\n1. **Up (U)**: (4,5) → (4,6)\n   - (4,6) is the second segment. **Invalid**.\n\n2. **Down (D)**: (4,5) → (4,4)\n   - (4,4) is free. **Valid**.\n\n3. **Left (L)**: (4,5) → (3,5)\n   - (3,5) is free. **Valid**.\n\n4. **Right (R)**: (4,5) → (5,5)\n   - (5,5) is occupied by body. **Invalid**.\n\n**Valid Moves at Turn 29**: Down (D) to (4,4) or Left (L) to (3,5).\n\nChoosing **Down (D) to (4,4)** to continue descending towards y=3.\n\n### Continuing the Sequence\n\nFollowing this pattern, a possible sequence is:\n\n- Turn 27: L to (4,6) [Eat food, grow to 12]\n- Turn 28: D to (4,5)\n- Turn 29: D to (4,4)\n- Turn 30: D to (4,3)\n- Turn 31: D to (4,2)\n- Turn 32: D to (4,1) [Assuming (4,1) is free by then]\n  \nHowever, this may not be the most efficient path to (6,3). An alternative is to start moving left after descending a bit to navigate around the body.\n\n### Optimal Immediate Action\n\nGiven that at Turn 27, the only valid move is Left (L) to (4,6), and the previous thinking model also concludes this, the immediate action is clear.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter carefully evaluating all possible moves and their implications, the only valid and safe move at Turn 27 is:\n\n\\boxed{L}",
        "state": "**Current Turn**: \\( t_0 = 27 \\)\n**Cells occupied by walls**:\n\t - Border Cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7.\n\t - Internal Obstacles: [(1, 6)]\n**Snake Positions**:[(5, 6), (6, 6), (6, 5), (5, 5), (5, 4), (5, 3), (5, 2), (5, 1), (4, 1), (3, 1), (2, 1)]\n**Snake Head Direction**: L\n**Food Positions, Life Span and Value**:\n\t- (4, 6, 5, 1)\n\t- (6, 3, 8, 1)\n> **Guidance from a Previous Thinking Model:** Turn \\( t_1 = 27 \\)\n> <think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 27, and I'm playing Snake on a 7x7 grid? The walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7), I think. Let me confirm: x from 0 to 7 inclusive, that's 8 cells, similarly for y. But the grid size isn't specified, so I'll assume coordinates from (0,0) to (7,7), with walls at the borders meaning I can't go to x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (1,6).\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (5,6), then (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1). So the snake is 11 segments long. Head direction is left (L), since it was moving left to get to (5,6) from (6,6)? Positions are given with head first: [(5,6), (6,6), ...], so it moved from (6,6) to (5,6), which is left, so head direction is L, as given.\n> \n> Food: There are two food items:\n> \n> - (4,6) with value 1 and life span 5. So it disappears after 5 turns, including current turn? Life span decreases every turn, including the current one. So at turn 27, life span 5, so it will be gone by turn 32? Let's see: at turn t, life span N, it will disappear after N turns, meaning it's gone at turn t + N. So for (4,6), at turn 27, life span 5, so it will disappear after turn 27 + 5 = 32? But since it decreases every turn including current, after turn 27, life span becomes 4, then turn 28:3, 29:2, 30:1, 31:0? Probably disappears when life span reaches 0. I need to clarify.\n> \n> Typically, if life span is N at turn t, it decreases by 1 each turn, so at turn t, it has N turns left, including turn t. So after N turns, it should be gone. For example, if N=5 at turn 27, then:\n> \n> - Turn 27: life span 5\n> \n> - Turn 28: life span 4\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - Turn 31: life span 1\n> \n> - Turn 32: life span 0, disappears? Or at turn 31 it has life span 1, so it can be eaten on turn 31, and then gone? The rule says: \"disappears after N turns (including current)\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> I think it's safer to assume that at turn t, with life span N, it will exist for N more turns, meaning it can be eaten on turns t to t+N-1, and disappears at turn t+N.\n> \n> Similarly for the other food: (6,3) with value 1 and life span 8. At turn 27, life span 8, so it can be eaten from turn 27 to turn 34, disappears at turn 35? Turn 27 + 8 = 35, but since including current, it might be gone at turn 35.\n> \n> Turn 27: N=8\n> \n> Turn 28: N=7\n> \n> ...\n> \n> Turn 34: N=1\n> \n> Turn 35: N=0, gone.\n> \n> But on turn 34, N=1, it can be eaten.\n> \n> Now, both foods have value 1, so positive food, but I need to be careful about risks.\n> \n> First, let's map out the grid.\n> \n> Grid: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n> \n> Walls: all cells where x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. Also internal obstacle at (1,6).\n> \n> So cells available: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except (1,6) is obstacle, so not accessible.\n> \n> (1,6) is occupied by wall? \"Internal obstacles: [(1,6)]\", and walls include border and internal, so (1,6) is an obstacle cell.\n> \n> Snake positions: let's list the cells occupied by snake.\n> \n> Head: (5,6)\n> \n> Body: (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1)\n> \n> Tail is (2,1)\n> \n> Current head direction is L, so moving left.\n> \n> Possible moves: I can move U, D, L, R, but cannot move opposite to current direction immediately? No instant reverse: cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\n> \n> Current direction is L, so opposite is R. So I cannot move right on this turn? The rule says: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\"\n> \n> \"on next turn\" – let's read carefully.\n> \n> \"Movement Constraints: In each turn you can choose to move 1 cell... No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\"\n> \n> It says \"on next turn\", but I think it means for the immediate next action. Let me parse.\n> \n> It says: \"Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\" – but \"current direction\" is the direction before the move, I think.\n> \n> At turn t, before moving, snake has a current direction. Then I choose a move for turn t. If I choose opposite to current direction, it's invalid? But the rule says \"on next turn\", which might be ambiguous.\n> \n> Let's read: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\"\n> \n> I think it means that when you choose an action for turn t, you cannot choose the opposite of the direction the snake was moving at the start of turn t.\n> \n> For example, at start of turn, head direction is L, so for turn t, I cannot move right (opposite).\n> \n> Similarly, for subsequent turns, I need to consider the new direction after each move.\n> \n> So for turn 27, current head direction is L, so I cannot move R. Possible moves: U, D, L.\n> \n> Now, let's see possible actions.\n> \n> First, head is at (5,6). Possible adjacent cells:\n> \n> - Up: (5,7) but y=7 is wall, so invalid.\n> \n> - Down: (5,5) but (5,5) is occupied by snake body. Is it? Snake positions: (5,6) head, then (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), ... yes, (5,5) is the fourth segment, so it's body, not tail.\n> \n> But can I move to body? Only if it's the tail and I'm not growing, but here (5,5) is not tail, tail is (2,1), so moving to (5,5) would be collision with body, death.\n> \n> Similarly, left: (4,6) – what is (4,6)? It has food, but let's see if it's occupied.\n> \n> (4,6) is a food position, not occupied by snake or wall? Walls are x=0,7 y=0,7 and (1,6) internal obstacle.\n> \n> (4,6): x=4, y=6, not border, not (1,6), so it's empty except for food.\n> \n> But snake is not on it now, head is at (5,6), so (4,6) is adjacent left.\n> \n> Also, right: (6,6) but (6,6) is the second segment, body, so collision if I move there.\n> \n> Down: (5,5) body, collision.\n> \n> Up: (5,7) wall.\n> \n> So only possible move from (5,6) is left to (4,6)? Is that right?\n> \n> Current position: (5,6)\n> \n> - U: (5,7) - y=7, wall, invalid\n> \n> - D: (5,5) - occupied by snake body (fourth segment), so collision, invalid\n> \n> - L: (4,6) - is this occupied? Food is at (4,6), but it's a cell, so I can move there to eat food, but need to check if it's safe.\n> \n> - R: (6,6) - occupied by snake body (second segment), collision, invalid\n> \n> So indeed, only possible move is left to (4,6).\n> \n> But is (4,6) safe? It has food, so if I move there, I eat the food, snake grows to length 12.\n> \n> But then I need to think about future moves.\n> \n> The head direction will change to L, since I moved left.\n> \n> Now, after moving to (4,6), what happens?\n> \n> Snake positions after move: head to (4,6), then body: since I ate food, the tail doesn't move, so new positions: [(4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1)] length 12.\n> \n> Tail is still (2,1).\n> \n> Now, at (4,6), head direction now L.\n> \n> Possible moves from there.\n> \n> But I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> Also, there's another food at (6,3) with life span 8, so plenty of time.\n> \n> But first, I have to move to (4,6) this turn, as it's the only choice?

Let me confirm.\n> \n> Walls: Border cells are x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (1,6). So the grid is from x=1 to x=6 and y=1 to y=6, except where blocked. x=0 and x=7 are walls, y=0 and y=7 are walls, so valid cells are x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.

So the snake is 12 segments long. Head direction is L, which is left, since last move was left to (4,6) from (5,6)?

Since it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I should plan at least 5 moves, but I might need more if necessary for the strategy.\n> \n> Also, I must avoid instant reverse: since head direction is L (left), I cannot move right on the next turn, so for turn 28, possible moves are U, D, L, but not R.\n> \n> Current head at (4,6), direction L.\n> \n> Possible moves from (4,6):\n> \n> - Up: (4,7) but y=7 is wall, so invalid.\n> \n> - Down: (4,5) – is this valid? y=5 is within 1-6, and not wall.\n> \n> - Left: (3,6) – x=3, y=6.\n> \n> - Right: (5,6) but that's the body segment, but let's check.\n> \n> Snake positions: head (4,6), next is (5,6), so (5,6) is the first body segment. If I move right to (5,6), that would be colliding with body, but since the snake moves, when head moves to a cell, if it's occupied by body at that time, it collides, but when the snake moves, the tail also moves, so the cell that was tail is freed, but (5,6) is not tail; tail is (2,1).\n> \n> Let's list all snake positions:\n> \n> Index 0: (4,6) head\n> \n> 1: (5,6)\n> \n> 2: (6,6)\n> \n> 3: (6,5)\n> \n> 4: (5,5)\n> \n> 5: (5,4)\n> \n> 6: (5,3)\n> \n> 7: (5,2)\n> \n> 8: (5,1)\n> \n> 9: (4,1)\n> \n> 10: (3,1)\n> \n> 11: (2,1) tail\n> \n> If I move right to (5,6), which is position index 1, but at the moment of move, (5,6) is occupied by the body, so head would collide with body, which is deadly.

So playable area is x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except (1,6) is blocked.\n> \n> List of playable cells: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, but (1,6) is obstacle, so not playable.\n> \n> Snake positions:\n> \n> - Head: (4,5)\n> \n> - Then: (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1)\n> \n> So the snake body occupies these cells. Head is at (4,5) moving down. Down means decreasing y, so from (4,5) down would be to (4,4), but let's see what's possible.\n> \n> Head direction is D (down), so last move was down. Now, possible moves: since I can't reverse instantly, I cannot move up (U), because that would be opposite to down. So possible moves: D (down), L (left), R (right). But I have to consider the grid and obstacles.\n> \n> Current head position: (4,5)\n> \n> Possible next positions:\n> \n> - Down (D): (4,4) - is this within bounds? y=4 is between 1 and 6, x=4 is between 1 and 6. Also, check if it's occupied or wall.\n> \n> Walls: x=0,7 and y=0,7, so (4,4) is fine. Is it occupied by snake? Snake positions: (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1). So (5,4) is occupied, but (4,4) is not in the list, so it's free. (4,4) is empty? Let's list all snake cells: (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1). Yes, (4,4) is not occupied, so moving down to (4,4) is possible.\n> \n> - Left (L): (3,5) - x=3, y=5. Walls: x=1 to 6, so (3,5) is within bounds. Is it occupied? Snake: (3,1) is tail, (4,5) head, (5,5) is body, no (3,5) in list, so free. So possible.\n> \n> - Right (R): (5,5) - but (5,5) is occupied by snake body. (5,5) is the 6th segment? Positions: index 0: (4,5) head, 1: (4,6), 2: (5,6), 3: (6,6), 4: (6,5), 5: (5,5), so (5,5) is a body segment, not the tail. So moving right to (5,5) would collide with body, deadly. So cannot move right.\n> \n> - Up (U): (4,6) - but up from (4,5) is (4,6), which is occupied by the second segment of the snake. Also, up is opposite to current direction down, so not allowed anyway.\n> \n> Current direction is down, so cannot move up (reverse).\n> \n> So possible moves: Down to (4,4) or Left to (3,5).\n> \n> Now, food locations: (6,3) and (3,4).\n> \n> (6,3) is at x=6,y=3. Snake body has (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), etc. (6,3) is not occupied, I think. Snake positions don't have (6,3), so it should be free.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,4) is at x=3,y=4. Snake has (3,1) and (4,1), but not (3,4), so free.\n> \n> I need to plan a sequence for at least 5 turns, but since food has life spans, I should aim to eat them if possible.\n> \n> First, let's think about getting to the foods.\n> \n> Food at (6,3): from head (4,5), how to get there? One way: down to (4,4), then right to (5,4), but (5,4) is occupied by snake body? Positions: (5,4) is the 7th segment? List: 0: (4,5), 1: (4,6), 2: (5,6), 3: (6,6), 4: (6,5), 5: (5,5), 6: (5,4), 7: (5,3), etc. So (5,4) is occupied by segment 6. So cannot go to (5,4) now.\n> \n> From (4,5), if I go down to (4,4), that's free. Then from (4,4), I can go down to (4,3), or left to (3,4), or right to (5,4) but (5,4) is occupied, so not possible.\n> \n> (5,4) is occupied, so from (4,4), possible moves: down to (4,3), left to (3,4), or right? Right to (5,4) is occupied, so not possible. Up to (4,5) but that's where head was, but after move, tail moves, so (4,5) might be free later, but at turn t+1, when head moves to (4,4), the tail moves away, so the body shifts.\n> \n> Important point: when the snake moves, the head goes to a new cell, and the tail is removed, so cells behind become free, except when eating food, tail grows.\n> \n> In this case, if I move down to (4,4), the head moves to (4,4), and the tail (3,1) is removed. So the new positions: head at (4,4), then (4,5) becomes the neck, and so on, with tail at (4,1) or something.\n> \n> Let's simulate one move.\n> \n> Current positions: [(4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1)]\n> \n> If I move down to (4,4), new head at (4,4), then the body: previous head (4,5) becomes first body segment, then (4,6), (5,6), etc., and tail (3,1) is removed. So new positions: [(4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1)] and (3,1) is gone. Tail is now (4,1).\n> \n> After move, snake is at [(4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1)]\n> \n> Now, (5,4) is still occupied, but it's the 8th segment? Index 0: head (4,4), 1: (4,5), 2: (4,6), 3: (5,6), 4: (6,6), 5: (6,5), 6: (5,5), 7: (5,4), etc. So (5,4) is occupied.\n> \n> Back to possible moves from (4,5) now.\n> \n> I can go down to (4,4) or left to (3,5).\n> \n> If I go left to (3,5), new head at (3,5), body: (4,5) becomes neck, then (4,6), etc., tail removed: (3,1) gone. New positions: [(3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1)]\n> \n> Now, (3,4) is a food location, and it's at (3,4), which is not occupied in this new position.\n> \n> Also, (6,3) is another food.\n> \n> Now, life spans: food at (6,3) disappears at turn 35, current turn 29, so 6 turns left? Life span 6, meaning it disappears after 6 turns from now, including current turn? Let's see the rule: \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So for food at (6,3), life_span=6 at turn 29, so countdown starts at 6, decreases each turn including turn 29, so it will be 5 at turn 30, 4 at 31, ..., 0 at turn 34, so disappears at turn 35? Countdown to 0, then disappears, I think.\n> \n> Rule: \"Disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So at turn t when present, countdown = N.\n> \n> After turn t, countdown = N-1, and so on, until countdown=0, then after that turn, it disappears? Or at countdown=0 it is still there but disappears after the turn?\n> \n> I think it's better to think: at the start of turn t, if food has life_span L, it will disappear after L more turns, meaning it can be eaten during turns t to t+L-1, and at turn t+L, it is gone.\n> \n> For example, at turn 29, life_span=6, so it can be eaten on turns 29,30,31,32,33,34, and disappears after turn 34, so not available on turn 35.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (3,4) life_span=9, available until turn 37 (29+8=37, disappear after 38?).\n> \n> Turn 29: countdown=6, after turn 29, countdown=5 for turn 30, ..., at turn 34, countdown=0, it is still present, can be eaten on turn 34, then after that, disappears, so not on turn 35.\n> \n> Similarly, for (3,4): life_span=9, at turn 29 countdown=9, can be eaten until turn 37 (countdown=0 at turn 37? Turn 29: cd=9, turn 30: cd=8, ..., turn 37: cd=0, eaten on turn 37 if possible, gone on turn 38.\n> \n> But since we start from turn 29, for (6,3), it must be eaten by turn 34.\n> \n> For (3,4), by turn 37.\n> \n> Now back to planning.\n> \n> From current position (4,5), I can move down to (4,4) or left to (3,5).\n> \n> If I move left to (3,5), I get closer to the food at (3,4).\n> \n> (3,4) is one step down from (3,5), since down decreases y.\n> \n> From (3,5), moving down to (3,4) would eat the food, since (3,4) has food.\n> \n> But is it safe? Let's see.\n> \n> If I move to (3,5) now, turn 29, action L.\n> \n> Then at turn 30, from (3,5), I can move down to (3,4) to eat the food.\n> \n> But when I eat food, the snake grows, so tail doesn't move, and I need to check for collisions.\n> \n> Also, there's a rule about tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has food, eating it kills.\n> \n> But here, tail is at (3,1), far from (3,4), so not adjacent, so should be fine.\n> \n> First, turn 29: move left to (3,5).\n> \n> New positions: head at (3,5), body: (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1) — tail is (4,1), since (3,1) removed.\n> \n> Original tail was (3,1), after move, positions: [(3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1)] so tail at (4,1).\n> \n> Now, at turn 30, from (3,5), I can move down to (3,4).\n> \n> (3,4) has food, value +1, so I eat it. Snake grows, so new head at (3,4), and tail stays, so the segment that was tail (4,1) is not removed, and a new segment is added at head.\n> \n> After eating, positions: head at (3,4), then the previous head (3,5) becomes first body, then (4,5), (4,6), etc., and since ate food, tail is not removed, so the last segment (4,1) remains, and we add a new segment at head? No.\n> \n> Standard snake: when moving, head goes to new cell, if no food, tail is removed. If food, tail is not removed, so snake grows by one.\n> \n> So positions: new head at (3,4), then the previous body starts from (3,5), so the list becomes: [(3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1)] — so 13 segments, tail at (4,1).\n> \n> Now, is there collision? Head at (3,4), body segments: (3,5), (4,5), etc. (3,4) is not touching any body except possibly adjacent, but head is on (3,4), body has (3,5) adjacent, but since it's the neck, it's ok, no collision. Other cells not (3,4), so safe.\n> \n> Then, after eating, I have to move on.\n> \n> But let's see the other food at (6,3).\n> \n> (6,3) is at x=6,y=3.

Possible moves:\n1. **U (Up)**: (3,6)\n   - Check: Not a wall, not occupied by snake. Valid.\n2. **D (Down)**: (3,4)\n   - Check: Not a wall, not occupied by snake, has food. Valid.\n3. **L (Left)**: (2,5)\n   - Check: Not a wall, not occupied by snake. Valid.\n4. **R (Right)**: (4,5)\n   - Check: Occupied by snake body (second segment). Invalid.\n\n### Evaluating Moves:\n1. **Move D to (3,4)**:\n   - Eat food at (3,4), grow to length 13.\n   - Future path: After eating, the snake will be longer, making it harder to reach (6,3) due to body blocks. \n   - Risk: May get stuck in a dead end later (as seen in simulations).\n\n2. **Move U to (3,6)**:\n   - Avoid eating now, go to safer area.\n   - Future path: Can loop back to eat (3,4) later (life span allows this).\n   - Downside: (6,3) is unreachable regardless, so no loss.\n\n3. **Move L to (2,5)**:\n   - Avoid eating now, explore left side.\n   - Future path: May not help reach (3,4) or (6,3) efficiently.\n\n### Decision:\n- The food at (6,3) is unreachable within its life span (5 turns), so it can be ignored.\n- The food at (3,4) can be eaten later (life span 8 turns), so no rush.\n- Moving U to (3,6) avoids immediate risks and keeps options open for later.

It's turn 30. The grid has walls at the borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. There's also an internal obstacle at (1,6). The snake positions are: head at (3,5), then (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1). That's 12 segments. The head direction is L, which is left, so moving towards decreasing x.\n> \n> Food positions: one at (6,3) with life span 5 and value +1, and another at (3,4) with life span 8 and value +1. Both are positive food, so eating them increases length by 1.\n> \n> I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks. Prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> Current head position: (3,5). Since direction is L, from (3,5), moving left would go to (2,5). But I need to check possible moves and avoid collisions.\n> \n> Possible moves: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), L (left, x-1), R (right, x+1). But I cannot instantly reverse. Since current direction is L, I cannot move R (right) on the next turn because that would be opposite. So possible moves from L are U, D, L (continue left), but not R.\n> \n> Current direction is L, so cannot move R immediately.\n> \n> Now, let's list all snake positions to avoid body collisions. Snake: (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1).\n> \n> Also, walls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and obstacle at (1,6).\n> \n> Food at (6,3) and (3,4).\n> \n> Life span: food at (6,3) has life span 5, meaning it disappears after 5 turns including this one, so if not eaten by turn 35, it's gone. Similarly, (3,4) has life span 8, so disappears after turn 38.\n> \n> Turn 30 is current, so eating on turn 30 counts for life span decrease.\n> \n> Life span decreases every turn, including current. So for food at (6,3), life span 5 at turn 30, so it will be there for turns 30,31,32,33,34, and disappear after that, so last chance to eat is turn 34? Let's clarify.\n> \n> If life span is N at turn t, it decreases each turn, and disappears when countdown reaches 0. So at turn t, countdown=N, turn t+1, countdown=N-1, ..., until countdown=1 at turn t+N-1, and after that turn, it disappears, so not available on turn t+N.\n> \n> Standard: if life span is N at turn t, it can be eaten on turns t to t+N-1, and gone on turn t+N.\n> \n> For (6,3): life span 5 at turn 30, so can be eaten on turns 30,31,32,33,34. Disappears after turn 34, so not on turn 35.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,4): life span 8 at turn 30, can be eaten turns 30 to 37, gone turn 38.\n> \n> Now, head at (3,5), direction L.\n> \n> Possible moves from (3,5):\n> \n> - U: to (3,6)\n> \n> - D: to (3,4)\n> \n> - L: to (2,5)\n> \n> - R: to (4,5) but (4,5) is the second segment of the snake, which is the body. Moving to (4,5) would cause collision because head touches body segment.\n> \n> Snake positions: head (3,5), then (4,5) is the immediate next, so if I move right to (4,5), that's occupied by the body, so collision.\n> \n> Similarly, moving left to (2,5): is (2,5) occupied? Let's see the positions: (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), etc. (2,5) is not listed, so probably free, but need to check walls and obstacles.\n> \n> Walls: x=0 to 7, y=0 to 7, so (2,5) should be within bounds. Obstacle at (1,6), not (2,5).\n> \n> Moving up to (3,6): (3,6) is not in snake positions? Positions: (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), etc. (3,6) not listed. Walls: y=7 is wall, but (3,6) is y=6, which is less than 7, so should be free? y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=6 is fine. x=3, between 0 and 7.\n> \n> Grid: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7, so (x,y) with x=0 and x=7 walls, y=0 and y=7 walls.\n> \n> So (3,6): x=3, y=6, not wall. Obstacle at (1,6), not (3,6).\n> \n> Moving down to (3,4): (3,4) is not in snake positions? Positions: (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), ... (5,1), (4,1). (3,4) not listed. And food is at (3,4), so it's there.\n> \n> (3,4) has food, and it's not occupied by snake, since snake is at different positions.\n> \n> But is (3,4) a valid cell? Yes, no wall, not snake body.\n> \n> Now, tail is at (4,1), but when snake moves, the tail moves, so positions change.\n> \n> I need to simulate moves.\n> \n> First, for turn 30, possible actions:\n> \n> - U: to (3,6)\n> \n> - D: to (3,4) which has food\n> \n> - L: to (2,5)\n> \n> - R: to (4,5) but (4,5) is occupied by body, so invalid, collision.\n> \n> So only U, D, L are possible, since R is invalid due to body.\n> \n> Also, cannot move R because it's reverse? Current direction is L, so moving R is opposite, which is not allowed anyway, even if not occupied. But here it is occupied, so definitely not.\n> \n> So options: U, D, or L.\n> \n> Now, moving D to (3,4) would eat the food there, since (3,4) has positive food.\n> \n> But I need to think ahead.\n> \n> Also, there's a risk: Tail Reward Danger. If head is adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it kills.\n> \n> Here, tail is at (4,1), head at (3,5), not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing an edge, so (3,5) and (4,1) are not adjacent; different x and y.\n> \n> So no immediate danger.\n> \n> But after eating, snake grows, so I need to be careful.\n> \n> Let's list all cells for clarity.\n> \n> Grid: 8x8? x from 0 to 7, so 8 cells each, but walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so playable area is x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? No.\n> \n> Walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, meaning those cells are walls, so the grid has cells from (0,0) to (7,7), but (0,y) for all y, (7,y) for all y, (x,0) for all x, (x,7) for all x are walls. Also internal obstacle at (1,6).\n> \n> So playable cells are x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except where obstacles.\n> \n> Internal obstacle only (1,6), so cells like (1,1) to (1,5) should be free, but (1,6) is wall.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,6) is obstacle, so not passable.\n> \n> Now, snake head (3,5), possible moves:\n> \n> - U: (3,6) - is this valid? y=6, but y=7 is wall, y=6 is not wall, so (3,6) should be free. Snake positions: (4,6) is occupied, but (3,6) is not listed, so free? Let's see all positions: head (3,5), then (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1). So (3,6) not occupied, no wall, not obstacle, so valid.\n> \n> - D: (3,4) - not occupied, has food, valid.\n> \n> - L: (2,5) - not occupied, no wall, valid. Obstacle at (1,6), not (2,5).\n> \n> - R: (4,5) - occupied by snake body, invalid.\n> \n> So for turn 30, I can choose U, D, or L.\n> \n> If I choose D, I go to (3,4) and eat the food there. Since it's positive food, snake length increases by 1, so after eating, the new head is (3,4), and the tail doesn't move? When you eat, the head moves to food, and the tail doesn't move, so snake grows by one segment.\n> \n> Standard snake: when you eat food, head moves to food cell, and a new segment is added, so tail stays in place for that turn? Or tail moves but new segment added at head.\n> \n> In terms of positions: before move, head at (3,5), body follows.\n> \n> After moving to (3,4), if no food, tail would move, so positions shift: head to (3,4), then (3,5) becomes new second segment, etc., tail moves away.\n> \n> But if I move to a food cell, then head moves to (3,4), and the tail does not move, so the snake grows: the new head is at (3,4), the previous head (3,5) is now part of body, and tail remains, so length increases by one.\n> \n> In this case, positions after eating: head (3,4), then (3,5), then (4,5), (4,6), ..., up to (4,1), but since tail doesn't move, (4,1) is still there, and new segment is added at head, so the body is longer.\n> \n> Specifically: after moving to food, snake positions: new head at (3,4), then previous positions from head to tail, but since tail doesn't move, the segment that was tail stays.\n> \n> Initial positions: index 0: (3,5) head, 1: (4,5), 2: (4,6), 3: (5,6), 4: (6,6), 5: (6,5), 6: (5,5), 7: (5,4), 8: (5,3), 9: (5,2), 10: (5,1), 11: (4,1) tail.\n> \n> After moving down to (3,4) and eating food: head moves to (3,4), and since food eaten, tail remains, so new positions: head (3,4), then (3,5), then (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1). So length 13 now, tail still at (4,1) for now, but on next move, tail will move if no food eaten.\n> \n> Similarly, for other moves.\n> \n> But back to turn 30 decision.\n> \n> If I go D to (3,4), I eat the food, score +1, length increases.\n> \n> But there's another food at (6,3) with shorter life span, only 5 turns left, so I might need to get it soon.\n> \n> (3,4) has life span 8, so more time.\n> \n> But let's think 5 turns ahead.\n> \n> First, I need to plan a sequence for multiple turns.\n> \n> The answer should include an action sequence for turn 30, 31, 32, etc., at least 5 turns, but it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", but the sequence might not be fixed, but for the output, I need to provide a sequence starting from t1.\n> \n> The format is to provide a sequence of actions for several turns.\n> \n> But since future depends on moves, I need to simulate based on choices.\n> \n> Perhaps I should choose a path that allows me to get to (6,3) safely.\n> \n> (6,3) has food, and it's at (6,3).\n> \n> Current head (3,5), food at (6,3) and (3,4).\n> \n> (3,4) is very close, directly below.\n> \n> But if I eat (3,4), I might block myself or something.\n> \n> Let's list the grid with snake and food.\n> \n> Grid cells:\n> \n> x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except walls and obstacles.\n> \n> Walls: all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and (1,6) obstacle.\n> \n> So for y=6, only x=2 to 6 are free, since x=1,y=6 is obstacle.\n> \n> Similarly, other rows.\n> \n> But let's not list all, just relevant.\n> \n> Snake occupies: (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1)\n> \n> So the snake is coiled around, especially in the bottom right.\n> \n> From (3,5) to (4,5) to (4,6) to (5,6) to (6,6) to (6,5) to (5,5) to (5,4) to (5,3) to (5,2) to (5,1) to (4,1).\n> \n> So it's like a path from left to right and down.\n> \n> Food at (3,4) and (6,3).\n> \n> (6,3) is currently occupied by the snake?

(1,6) is at x=1,y=6, so (2,5) is different. Also, no wall there. So (2,5) seems free.\n> \n> - Move L to (1,6): x=1,y=6. But there's an internal obstacle at (1,6), so it's a wall.

This sets up the snake to eat the positive food at (3,4) on the next turn (Turn 34) and then move down again to (3,3) on Turn 35 to avoid congestion and ensure long-term survival.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{D}",

It's turn 33, and the grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So coordinates range from (0,0) to (7,7), with walls on the borders. There's also an internal obstacle at (1,6).\n> \n> The snake positions are: head at (2,5), then (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2). That's 13 segments. Head direction is down, which is decreasing y, since y increases up? No, let's clarify the coordinate system.\n> \n> Typically in such grids, (0,0) is bottom-left, y increases up, x increases right. But movement: U is (x,y+1) which might be up if y increases up, but let's see the definition.\n> \n> From the problem: U`(x,y+1)`, D`(x,y-1)`, so if U is (x,y+1), that means y+1 is up, so higher y is north. Similarly, D is down, y-1.\n> \n> In the snake positions, head is at (2,5), and direction is D, down, so moving to lower y.\n> \n> Now food: two pieces:\n> \n> - (6,3) with value 1 and life span 2. So it disappears after 2 turns, including current turn? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so if life span is 2 at turn 33, it will disappear at the end of turn 34? Let me confirm.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So at turn 33, life span is 2, meaning it has 2 turns left including this one. After turn 33, life span becomes 1, after turn 34 it becomes 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten on turn 33 or 34, but not after.\n> \n> Similarly, the other food at (3,4) with value 1, life span 5. So it has 5 turns left, including turn 33, so it will be around until turn 37.\n> \n> Both foods have value 1, so positive food.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (2,5), direction down. So current possible moves: since direction is D, I can't move up immediately? No instant reverse: cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\n> \n> Current direction is D, so opposite is U. So I cannot move U on this turn. Possible moves: D, L, R? But I have to consider the grid and collisions.\n> \n> From (2,5), moving:\n> \n> - U (up): (2,6) – but that's occupied by the snake body? Snake positions: head (2,5), next is (2,6), so (2,6) is the first body segment. Moving to (2,6) would be a collision with body, which is deadly. So I cannot move up.\n> \n> - D (down): (2,4) – is this within bounds? Walls at y=0 and y=7, so y=4 is between 0 and 7, x=2 between 0 and 7, no wall mentioned at (2,4), and not occupied by snake? Let's list snake positions: (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2). So (2,4) is not in the list, so it should be free.\n> \n> - L (left): (1,5) – x=1, y=5. Walls: borders x=0 and x=7, so x=1 is fine. Obstacles: internal obstacle at (1,6), but (1,5) is different. Snake positions: is (1,5) occupied? Not in the list, so free.\n> \n> - R (right): (3,5) – (3,5) is occupied by snake body; it's the fourth segment. Positions: index 0: (2,5) head, 1: (2,6), 2: (3,6), 3: (3,5), so (3,5) is occupied. Moving right to (3,5) would collide with body.\n> \n> So possible moves from current position:\n> \n> - U: not possible, body collision\n> \n> - D: (2,4) – seems free\n> \n> - L: (1,5) – seems free\n> \n> - R: not possible, body collision\n> \n> Also, cannot move opposite to current direction, which is U, so U is invalid anyway.\n> \n> So only possible moves: D or L.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score and survival.\n> \n> First, let's map out the grid for clarity.\n> \n> Grid 8x8: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n> \n> Walls: borders, so cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls.

The tail was at (5,2), so when I move, the head moves to new position, and the tail moves off if no food eaten. Since no food at (2,4), length remains same, tail moves, so the cell (5,2) is vacated.\n> \n> Then, on next turn, head at (2,4), direction was D, so now I can move from there.\n> \n> Possible moves from (2,4): U, D, L, R, but with direction constraint?

It's turn 34. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and an internal obstacle at (1,6). So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls block movement.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (2,4), then body segments: (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3). That's 13 segments. Head direction is Down, which means it's moving down, so from (2,4) to (2,5) would be down, but since it's moving down, the next position should be south.\n> \n> Head is at (2,4), direction D, so last move was down to (2,4). Current direction is D, so it was moving down to get to (2,4).\n> \n> Now, food:\n> \n> - (6,3) with value 1, life span 1 (so it disappears after this turn if not eaten? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so since life span is 1, after this turn it might disappear if not eaten. Life span 1 means it has 1 turn left, including this turn, so after turn 34, it will be gone if not eaten during turn 34.)\n> \n> Life span: \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So for food at (6,3), life_span=1, meaning after this turn (turn 34), it will disappear. Similarly, (3,4) has life_span=4, so it will disappear after turn 34+4-1? Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So if life_span is given as N, at the start of turn t, it has N turns left. After that turn, if not eaten, countdown decreases by one. When countdown reaches 0, it disappears after the turn it was supposed to be eaten or after the decrease.\n> \n> Example: if food spawns with life_span N, on turn t, it can be eaten on turns t, t+1, ..., t+N-1, and disappears after turn t+N-1? I need to be careful.\n> \n> The problem says: \"life-span: disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> I think it's better to think: at the beginning of a turn, for each food, its life_span is the number of turns it will last, including the current turn. So if life_span is 1, it will disappear after this turn, meaning it can only be eaten this turn. If not eaten this turn, it's gone.\n> \n> Similarly, life_span 4: it can be eaten on this turn or the next 3 turns, disappearing after turn 34+3 = 37? Let's index turns.\n> \n> Turn 34: current turn.\n> \n> For food at (6,3): life_span=1, so it will disappear after turn 34. That means if not eaten during turn 34, it's gone.\n> \n> Food at (3,4): life_span=4, so it will disappear after 4 turns from now. Since countdown includes current turn, after turn 34, life_span decreases to 3, then 2, then 1, then 0 and disappears after turn 37. So it can be eaten on turns 34,35,36,37? Turns when available: turn t to t + life_span - 1.\n> \n> At turn t, with life_span L, it is available from turn t to turn t + L - 1.\n> \n> After turn t + L - 1, it disappears.\n> \n> So for (6,3): L=1, available only on turn 34.\n> \n> (3,4): L=4, available turns 34,35,36,37.\n> \n> (4,1): L=10, available turns 34 to 43.\n> \n> All have value 1, so positive food.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (2,4), direction Down.\n> \n> Possible moves: since direction is Down, I can move Down, Left, or Right, but not Up because that would be reverse, and no instant reverse is allowed. Current direction D, so cannot move U (opposite).\n> \n> So possible actions: D, L, R.\n> \n> Now, coordinates: head (2,4), moving D would go to (2,3), since y decreases when moving down? I need to define the coordinate system.\n> \n> Typically in grids, (0,0) is bottom-left or top-left? The problem doesn't specify, but from the walls: border y=0 and y=7, and snake positions: head (2,4), then (2,5), (2,6). (2,6) has y=6, which is higher, so if y=0 is bottom, then y=6 is near top, so moving down from (2,4) to (2,5) would be increasing y if y=0 bottom, but usually in such games, y=0 is top, so moving down increases y.\n> \n> Let's see the positions: snake positions: [(2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), ...] so from head to tail: (2,4) -> (2,5) -> (2,6) -> (3,6), etc. So y increases from 4 to 5 to 6, so y=0 is probably top, y=7 bottom. So moving down increases y, moving up decreases y.\n> \n> Confirm with walls: y=0 and y=7 are borders. So if y=0 is top row, y=7 bottom row, then moving down from (2,4) to (2,5) is south, increasing y.\n> \n> Similarly, moving up decreases y.\n> \n> Head direction is D, meaning it was moving down to (2,4), so from previous position, it came down to (2,4).\n> \n> Now, possible moves from (2,4):\n> \n> - Down (D): to (2,5)\n> \n> - Left (L): to (1,4)\n> \n> - Right (R): to (3,4)\n> \n> Cannot move Up to (2,3) because reverse not allowed.\n> \n> Now, check if these positions are valid: not walls and not body collision.\n> \n> Walls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and internal obstacle (1,6).\n> \n> (2,5): is it a wall? y=5, not border, and not (1,6), so no wall. But is it occupied by body?\n> \n> Snake positions: (2,4) head, then (2,5), (2,6), etc. So (2,5) is the first body segment. Moving to (2,5) would be colliding with body, which is deadly. So cannot move Down to (2,5).\n> \n> Similarly, (1,4): x=1, y=4. Walls: x=0 is border, so x=1 is not wall. Internal obstacle (1,6), but (1,4) is different, so no wall. Is it body? Snake positions: list is (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3). So (1,4) not in list, so free?

So (1,4) not occupied, so should be safe to move to, unless it's a wall, which it's not.\n> \n> (3,4): x=3,y=4, not wall, not in snake positions, so free.\n> \n> Also, food at (3,4), which is one of the food positions.\n> \n> (3,4) has food with value 1.\n> \n> Now, possible moves:\n> \n> - D: (2,5) is body, collision, invalid.\n> \n> - L: (1,4) is empty, valid.\n> \n> - R: (3,4) has food, and empty except for food, so valid to move there and eat.\n> \n> But we have to think multiple turns ahead.\n> \n> Also, there is food at (6,3) which must be eaten this turn or it disappears, and (4,1) which has time.\n> \n> (6,3) is at turn 34 only.\n> \n> Now, head at (2,4), (6,3) is at x=6,y=3.\n> \n> To reach (6,3) from (2,4), it's 4 steps right and 1 down? x from 2 to 6, delta x=4, y from 4 to 3, delta y=-1, so 4 right and 1 up, but since we can only move one step per turn, minimum 5 moves, but we need to get there this turn to eat it, since life span 1.\n> \n> This turn, turn 34, head is at (2,4), food at (6,3). To eat it this turn, we must move directly to (6,3), but we can only move one cell, so impossible to eat (6,3) this turn because it's not adjacent.\n> \n> Adjacent means sharing an edge, so neighbors: up, down, left, right.\n> \n> (2,4) neighbors: (2,3) up, (2,5) down, (1,4) left, (3,4) right.\n> \n> (6,3) is not adjacent to (2,4); it's at distance |6-2| + |3-4| = 4 + 1 = 5, so not reachable in one move.

It's turn 36, and I'm the snake AI. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and one internal obstacle at (1,6). So, the playable area is from x=1 to x=6 and y=1 to y=6, except where blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions: The head is at (3,3), and the body segments follow: (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4). That's 14 segments, so the snake is quite long.\n> \n> Head direction is down (D), meaning the snake is moving downward, so from (3,3), moving down would go to (3,2), but let's confirm the coordinates. Typically, in grids, y increases upwards, but here, moving down decreases y? Let's see the movement definitions: U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), L is (x-1,y), R is (x+1,y). So y=0 is the bottom, and y=7 is the top? Walls are at y=0 and y=7, so y=0 is bottom row, y=7 is top row. Moving up increases y, moving down decreases y.\n> \n> Head is at (3,3), direction down, so last move was to (3,3) from above, I assume. Positions: head (3,3), then (3,4), which is above (since y=4 > y=3), so yes, the snake was moving down to (3,3) from (3,4). The list is head first: (3,3) is head, then (3,4) is the next segment, which is directly above, so the snake is moving downward.\n> \n> Food: Only one food mentioned: at (4,1) with value 1 and life span 9. Value 1 means positive food, since +1. Life span 9, so it disappears after 9 turns, including the current turn? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 36, life span 9, it will disappear after turn 36 + 9 - 1? Let's clarify.\n> \n> Life span: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So for food at turn t with life span N, it will be available for N turns: on turn t, life span is N, on turn t+1, it becomes N-1, and so on, until it reaches 0, then disappears. So at turn 36 with life span 9, it will disappear after turn 44? On turn 36, life span 9, meaning it has 9 turns left including this one. After 9 turns, on turn 45, it should be gone. But let's confirm:\n> \n> - Turn 36: life span 9\n> \n> - Turn 37: life span 8\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - Turn 44: life span 1\n> \n> - Turn 45: life span 0, disappears before the turn or after? The rule says \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So after N turns from now, it disappears. For example, if spawned at turn t, it disappears after t + N turns, meaning on turn t + N, it's not there anymore.\n> \n> Standard interpretation: at the start of turn t, if food has life span L, it can be eaten during turn t, and at the end of turn, life span decreases by 1. If life span reaches 0, it disappears before the next turn.\n> \n> But for decision making, on turn t, with life span L, it will be there for L more turns (including current if we can move to it).\n> \n> Since we're choosing actions for future turns, we need to know when it will disappear.\n> \n> For food at (4,1) with life span 9 at turn 36:\n> \n> - Available from turn 36 to turn 44 inclusive? On turn 36, life span 9, so after turn 36, it decreases to 8, so it can be eaten on turns 36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44. On turn 45, life span would be 0, so not available.\n> \n> Life span 9 at turn 36 means it has 9 turns of existence left, starting from turn 36. So turns 36 to 44 (9 turns), gone on turn 45.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks. Only one food is present, at (4,1), which is positive.\n> \n> First, let's map the grid. Walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so playable area: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except internal obstacle at (1,6).\n> \n> (1,6) is a wall, so cannot go there.\n> \n> Now, snake positions: let's list all positions to visualize.\n> \n> Head: (3,3)\n> \n> Body: (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4)\n> \n> Since head is at (3,3) and moving down, possible moves from (3,3) are U, D, L, R, but with constraints.\n> \n> Current head direction is D (down), so I cannot instantly reverse to U (up), because no instant reverse rule. So from down, I cannot go up immediately; I can go left, right, or continue down.\n> \n> Possible moves from (3,3):\n> \n> - Down (D): to (3,2) - but y=2, which is within 1 to 6, and not a wall? Walls are y=0 and y=7, so y=2 is fine. But is (3,2) occupied? Snake positions: let's see all occupied cells.\n> \n> List all snake segments: (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4)\n> \n> So (3,2) is not in this list, so it should be free, unless wall. Walls: borders and (1,6), so (3,2) is not wall, so D to (3,2) is possible.\n> \n> - Left (L): to (2,3) - x=2, y=3. Is it occupied? Positions: (2,4), (2,5), (2,6) are there, but (2,3) not listed, so probably free. Walls: x=0, x=7, so x=2 is fine. Not (1,6), which is different. So (2,3) should be free.\n> \n> - Right (R): to (4,3) - (4,3) not in positions, walls not there, so free.\n> \n> - Up (U): to (3,4) - but (3,4) is the second segment, directly above head. Moving up would go to (3,4), which is part of the body, so collision? But according to rules, body collision: head touches any body segment except the tail in some cases? Rule says: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> Important: when moving, if the head moves to a cell that is occupied by a body segment, it's collision, except if that body segment is the tail and it will move away at the same time.\n> \n> In this case, moving to (3,4): (3,4) is the second segment, not the tail. The tail is (5,4), I think. Positions: head (3,3), then (3,4), (2,4), ..., (5,4) is the last one? Let's count: indices from 0: 0:(3,3), 1:(3,4), 2:(2,4), 3:(2,5), 4:(2,6), 5:(3,6), 6:(3,5), 7:(4,5), 8:(4,6), 9:(5,6), 10:(6,6), 11:(6,5), 12:(5,5), 13:(5,4). So 14 segments, tail is (5,4).\n> \n> (3,4) is the first body segment after head, not tail. So if head moves to (3,4), it would collide with body, death.\n> \n> Therefore, moving up to (3,4) is not possible; it would cause collision.\n> \n> Similarly, moving down to (3,2) should be fine, as it's empty.\n> \n> Left to (2,3): empty.\n> \n> Right to (4,3): empty.\n> \n> Also, walls not an issue here.\n> \n> Now, food is at (4,1), which is to the right and down from head. (4,1) vs head at (3,3), so Δx=1, Δy=-2? y=1 is below y=3 since down decreases y.\n> \n> Distance: x-diff: 4-3=1, y-diff: 1-3= -2, so 1 right, 2 down.\n> \n> But I need to think multiple moves ahead.\n> \n> Also, the snake is long, 14 segments, so space might be tight.\n> \n> First, possible actions for turn 36: since head direction is D, I can go D, L, or R. U is reverse and also blocked by body, so not possible. So options: D, L, R.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan a sequence to eat the food at (4,1) if possible, since it's the only food, and it's positive.\n> \n> (4,1) is at y=1, which is one above the bottom wall y=0. So it's on the bottom row of playable area, since y=1 to 6.\n> \n> Similarly, x=4.\n> \n> Now, to reach (4,1) from (3,3), I need to go right and down.\n> \n> Specifically, to (4,1), from (3,3), I can go right to (4,3), then down to (4,2), then down to (4,1). That's two moves down after right.\n> \n> But I need to consider the body and the path.\n> \n> Also, after eating, the snake grows, so I need to avoid trapping myself.\n> \n> Moreover, the tail position: tail is at (5,4), which might move.\n> \n> Since I'm thinking 5+ turns ahead, I should simulate possible paths.\n> \n> First, let's sketch the grid.\n> \n> Grid: 6x6 playable, x=1-6, y=1-6.\n> \n> Walls: border x=0,7; y=0,7; internal (1,6) wall.\n> \n> So cells: let's list rows y=6 to y=1 (top to bottom).\n> \n> y=6: x=1 to 6, but (1,6) is wall, so available: (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6)\n> \n> y=5: all x=1-6 available?

This could lead to a dead end.\n- **Left (L) to (3, 2)**:\n  - No food at (3, 2).\n  - Safe: Not a wall or body collision.\n  - If moved:\n    - Body shifts, and the segment at (2, 4) moves to (3, 4), vacating (2, 4).\n    - Next turn: From (3, 2), can move Left to (2, 2) or Down to (3, 1) to eventually reach (2, 4) for food.\n- **Right (R) to (5, 2)**:\n  - No food at (5, 2).\n  - Safe: Not a wall or body collision.\n  - If moved:\n    - Body shifts, but (2, 4) remains occupied (segment moves from (2, 4) to (3, 4), but (2, 4) is still occupied by another segment).\n    - Next turn: From (5, 2), can move Up to (5, 3) or Right to (6, 2), but this doesn't help reach (2, 4).\n\n### Decision:\n- Moving **Down (D)** to (4, 1) is risky because it leads to a potential dead end with limited future moves.\n- Moving **Right (R)** doesn't help free (2, 4) and doesn't provide a clear path to food.\n- Moving **Left (L)** to (3, 2) is the best choice because:\n  1. It vacates (2, 4) (food location) by shifting the body.\n  2. On the next turn, from (3, 2), we can move Left to (2, 2), then Up to (2, 3), then Up to (2, 4) to safely eat the food at (2, 4).\n\n### Immediate Action:\n\\boxed{L} (Left to (3, 2))",

Also, there's an internal obstacle at (1,6).\n> \n> **Snake Positions**: The snake has 14 segments. Head is at (4,2), and the body follows: (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5). The tail is at (6,5).\n> \n> **Snake Head Direction**: Currently moving Down (D), which is decreasing y since D is (x, y-1). Head at (4,2), moving down would go to (4,1).\n> \n> **Food**:\n> - Food at (4,1) with value 1 and life span 7. Since life span decreases every turn, including current, it will disappear after turn 38 + 7 - 1? Let's clarify life span.\n> \n> Life span: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\" So if life_span is 7 on turn 38, it means:\n> - On turn 38, life_span = 7\n> - Turn 39: life_span = 6\n> - ...\n> - Turn 44: life_span = 1\n> - Turn 45: life_span = 0, disappears. So it can be eaten from turn 38 to 44.\n> \n> Similarly, the other food at (2,4) with value 1, life_span 9, so it lasts until turn 38 + 9 - 1 = 46? Let's calculate:\n> \n> - Turn 38: life_span 9\n> - Decreases each turn, so on turn 38: available, life_span 9\n> - Turn 39: 8\n> - ...\n> - Turn 46: life_span 1\n> - Turn 47: life_span 0, disappears. So it can be eaten up to turn 46.\n> \n> Value is +1 for both, so both are positive food.\n> \n> Now, the snake head is at (4,2), moving Down. If it moves Down to (4,1), that's where the food is. (4,1) has food with value 1.\n> \n> But I need to consider if eating it is safe. There's a rule about \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail collide.\n> \n> First, where is the tail? Snake positions: tail is at (6,5). Head is at (4,2), which is not adjacent to (6,5). Adjacent means sharing an edge, so up, down, left, right.\n> \n> (4,2) to (6,5): delta x=2, delta y=3, not adjacent. So no issue with tail reward danger here.\n> \n> Also, moving to (4,1): is it a wall? Walls are borders: x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7. (4,1) is within bounds, y=1>0, so not a border wall. Internal obstacle at (1,6), not (4,1), so safe.\n> \n> But (4,1) has food. If snake moves down to (4,1), it eats the food, so length increases by 1, and the food is consumed.\n> \n> Now, after moving, the snake body: since it eats food, a new segment is added, so positions become: head at (4,1), then previous head (4,2) becomes body, and so on, tail at (6,5) but since it grows, the tail doesn't move, so new tail is still (6,5)? No.\n> \n> Standard snake mechanics: when snake eats food, it grows, so the head moves to the food cell, and a new segment is added at the tail, so the tail doesn't move that turn.\n> \n> In this case, if head moves to (4,1), which has food, it eats it, so snake grows. New positions: head at (4,1), then previous positions: (4,2) now body, (4,3), (3,3), etc., up to (6,6), and since it grows, the tail (6,5) stays, but the last segment was (6,5), before that (6,6). Positions: the body segments are fixed until the tail moves.\n> \n> Let's list current positions:\n> \n> Index: 0: head (4,2)\n> \n> 1: (4,3)\n> \n> 2: (3,3)\n> \n> 3: (3,4)\n> \n> 4: (2,4) — here's (2,4) which has food, but it's under the body? Food at (2,4) is listed, but in snake positions, (2,4) is the 4th segment, so body, not head.\n> \n> Food can spawn under body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves in.\n> \n> Currently, (2,4) has food, but it's occupied by the snake body, so it can't be eaten now. Only if the snake moves such that the body leaves (2,4) and head enters later.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,1) is empty or has food? (4,1) has food, and it's not occupied by snake, since snake is at (4,2) etc., positions don't include (4,1), so head can move there and eat it.\n> \n> Back to moving to (4,1).\n> \n> If I move Down to (4,1) on turn 38, I eat the food, grow to 15 segments, score +1.\n> \n> But I need to think ahead 5+ turns.\n> \n> Also, current head direction is D, so moving Down is allowed. No instant reverse: since current direction is D, opposite is U, so I can move D, L, or R, but not U.\n> \n> Possible moves from (4,2):\n> \n> - Down (D) to (4,1) — has food\n> \n> - Left (L) to (3,2)\n> \n> - Right (R) to (5,2)\n> \n> Down to (4,1) is available and has food.\n> \n> But is it safe? (4,1) is not a wall, not body, and not adjacent to tail in a dangerous way, as we saw.\n> \n> After moving to (4,1), head is at (4,1), direction is D.\n> \n> Then for next turn, turn 39, possible moves from (4,1):\n> \n> - Down to (4,0) — but y=0 is border wall, so die if move there.\n> \n> - Left to (3,1)\n> \n> - Right to (5,1)\n> \n> - Up to (4,2) — but (4,2) is now body? After moving to (4,1), positions: head (4,1), then (4,2), (4,3), ..., up to tail (6,5). So (4,2) is the second segment, so moving Up to (4,2) would collide with body, die.\n> \n> So from (4,1), cannot move Down (wall), cannot move Up (body), so only Left or Right.\n> \n> Move Left to (3,1) or Right to (5,1).\n> \n> Now, I need to consider the other food at (2,4), which is currently under the body at index 4.\n> \n> (2,4) has food, and it's part of the snake body. To eat it, the snake must move so that the segment at (2,4) moves away, and then head moves to (2,4).\n> \n> Currently, the snake is moving, so positions change each turn.\n> \n> Let me sketch the grid.\n> \n> Grid 8x8, x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n> \n> Walls: borders x=0,x=7,y=0,y=7, and internal obstacle at (1,6).\n> \n> Snake positions: head (4,2), then (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5).

(2,4) life 9, until turn 46.\n> \n> Turn 38 now.\n> \n> If I eat (4,1) on turn 38, then on turn 39, I'm at (4,1) with only Left or Right moves.\n> \n> Say I move Left to (3,1).

When snake grows, the head moves to new position, and a new segment is added at the tail, so the tail position stays the same.\n> \n> Standard: when no eat, head moves to new cell, tail moves from last position, so snake moves forward.\n> \n> When eat, head moves to food, tail does not move, so new segment is added at the previous tail position.\n> \n> In this case, before turn 38, positions: 14 segments, tail at (6,5).\n> \n> Turn 38: move to (4,1), which has food, so head moves to (4,1), and since it ate, tail does not move, so the new positions are: head (4,1), then the previous 14 segments, but the last segment (tail) remains, so 15 segments: (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5).

After moving head to (2,2), the snake moves: head to (2,2), tail (6,6) removed, so body shifts: new positions: head (2,2), then (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), but (2,4) was index 5, now after shift, the segment that was at (2,4) moves to where? Let's see the sequence.\n> \n> Original positions before move: [(3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6)]\n> \n> After moving head to (2,2), not eating, so tail (6,6) removed, new head (2,2), then the next segments: the first body segment was (3,2), now at index 1, but since head moved, the list becomes: head (2,2), then the previous head (3,2) becomes segment 1, then (4,2) segment 2, (4,3) segment 3, (3,3) segment 4, (3,4) segment 5, (2,4) segment 6, (2,5) segment 7, (2,6) segment 8, (3,6) segment 9, (3,5) segment 10, (4,5) segment 11, (4,6) segment 12, (5,6) segment 13. Tail was (6,6) removed, so now snake has 13 segments? Original 14 segments, head moved to new position, not eating, so tail removed, so 13 segments now.\n> \n> Positions: head (2,2), then (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6). (5,6) is now the tail.\n> \n> (4,6) and (5,6) are there, but (6,6) removed.\n> \n> Now, the food at (2,4) is still under the body, at segment 7: (2,4) in new list? Index: head (2,2) index 0, (3,2) index 1, (4,2) index 2, (4,3) index 3, (3,3) index 4, (3,4) index 5, (2,4) index 6, (2,5) index 7, etc. So (2,4) is at index 6, occupied.\n> \n> To free (2,4), the snake needs to move so that this segment moves away. Since the snake moves forward, the segment at (2,4) will move to the next position based on the movement.\n> \n> For example, if from here, I move U to (2,3), then head to (2,3), tail (5,6) removed, body shifts: head (2,3), then (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6). (2,4) is still occupied, now at index 7.\n> \n> (2,4) is not moving yet; it's the segment that was at (2,4) will move when the segment before it moves.\n> \n> The segment at (2,4) will move to where the segment at (2,5) was or something; it's better to think of the body following the head.\n> \n> When the head moves, each segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> So for the cell (2,4), the segment there will leave only if the snake moves in a way that the segment occupying (2,4) moves to a different cell.\n> \n> Currently, at turn 39 after move L, positions include (2,4) at index 6.\n> \n> If I move the head, say to (2,3), then the segment that was at (2,4) will move to the position of the previous segment for that index, but it's messy.\n> \n> The cell (2,4) will be freed when the segment currently there moves away, which depends on the path the snake takes.\n> \n> To free (2,4) quickly, I need to move in a direction that pulls the body away from (2,4).\n> \n> Currently, the body at (2,4) is connected to (3,4) before and (2,5) after in the list, but the list is from head to tail.\n> \n> From the positions, (3,4) to (2,4) to (2,5), so (2,4) is between (3,4) and (2,5).\n> \n> If the head moves in a way that the body moves, the segment at (2,4) will move to where the next segment was or previous; it's the position update.\n> \n> Perhaps I should simulate a few moves.\n> \n> First, let's consider the food at (4,1). It has life span 6, so it will disappear on turn 45, so I have from turn 39 to 44 to eat it, 6 turns including 39.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,4) life span 8, disappear on turn 47, so more time.\n> \n> But (2,4) is under body, so it might take time to free it.\n> \n> (4,1) is easy to eat soon.\n> \n> But I need to think long-term.\n> \n> Also, there is a danger with tail reward: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> But tail is moving, so when you eat food, the tail doesn't move, so if head moves to a cell that was tail, and you eat, the tail stays, so if the food was under tail, and you eat it, the head is where tail was, and tail doesn't move, so they are on same cell? No.\n> \n> Special case: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n> \n> Let's read: \"if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n> \n> So it's when the head moves to a cell that is adjacent to the current tail, and that cell has food, but the food is on the tail cell, I think.\n> \n> The scenario: suppose the tail is at position P, and P has food on it (positive). If the head moves to P, it eats the food, so the snake grows, meaning the tail does not move, so the head is now at P, and the tail is still at P? No, when you eat, the head moves to the food cell, and a new segment is added at the tail, so the tail position doesn't change immediately; it stays for this turn, and next turn when you move, the tail may or may not move.\n> \n> But the collision happens because after eating, the head is at the food cell, which was the tail position, and since you grew, the tail doesn't advance, so head and tail are on the same cell? That would be collision immediately.\n> \n> Let's think: normally, when you eat food, the head moves to the food cell, and the tail does not move, so for that turn, the head is on the food cell, and the tail is still there, but the tail is part of the body, so if head and tail are on same cell, it's collision.\n> \n> But in standard snake, when you eat, you grow, so the tail stays, and head moves to food, but if food is where tail was, then head moves to tail position, and tail is still there, so they occupy the same cell, which is collision.\n> \n> Yes, that's the danger.\n> \n> In this case, for food at (2,4), it's currently under a body segment, not the tail. Tail is at (6,6), far away.\n> \n> So if I eat (2,4), it's not the tail, so no problem; head moves to (2,4), which was body, but when I move there, the body has moved away, so it should be fine, as long as when I move head to (2,4), the segment that was there is gone.\n> \n> Only if it's the tail cell with food and head adjacent, then eating causes problem.\n> \n> For now, (2,4) is not tail, so no issue.\n> \n> Similarly for (4,1), not near tail.\n> \n> Tail is at (6,6), head at (3,2), not adjacent.\n> \n> So no immediate danger.\n> \n> Now, back to planning.\n> \n> I have two food options: (4,1) can be eaten soon, (2,4) needs to be freed.\n> \n> If I eat (4,1) now, snake grows, which might make it harder to maneuver later, but also gives score.\n> \n> But I need to survive.\n> \n> Let's list possible action sequences.\n> \n> First, option: on turn 39, move D to (3,1).\n> \n> Then at (3,1), I can move R to (4,1) to eat the food on turn 40.\n> \n> Or move L to (2,1).\n> \n> If I move R to (4,1) on turn 40, I eat food, so snake grows: head to (4,1), then (3,1), (3,2), etc., and tail not removed, so length 15 now.\n> \n> Direction after moving R, from (3,1) to (4,1), so direction R.\n> \n> Then from (4,1), possible moves: U to (4,2), but (4,2) is body?

The action I choose can be U, D, L, R, but D is not possible, so I must choose another move.\n> \n> The head direction is the current moving direction, but I can change it, except I cannot do an instant reverse. Since direction is D (down), reverse would be U (up). So I cannot move up immediately, because that would be opposite direction.\n> \n> Current head direction is D, so moving up (U) is reverse, which is not allowed. Moving down (D) is into the wall, not possible. So possible moves are left (L) or right (R).\n> \n> Let's list possible moves from (3,1):\n> \n> - U: up to (3,2)\n> \n> - D: down to (3,0) — wall, invalid\n> \n> - L: left to (2,1)\n> \n> - R: right to (4,1)\n> \n> But U is reverse? Current direction is D, so moving U would be opposite, so not allowed. Therefore, from (3,1) with direction D, possible actions are L or R only.\n> \n> Now, (3,2) is occupied by the snake body. Snake positions: head (3,1), then (3,2) is the second segment, which is the body.\n> \n> Moving to (3,2) would be colliding with body, but (3,2) is the next segment after head. Since the tail will move, when the snake moves, the head moves to a new position, and the tail moves forward, so the cell that was the tail is vacated, except when eating food.\n> \n> But for body collision, if head moves to a cell occupied by a body segment that is not the tail, it collides. But the tail is special because it moves.\n> \n> In this case, (3,2) is the segment right after head, so if head moves to (3,2), that would be colliding with its own body immediately, since (3,2) is not the tail; the tail is at (5,6).\n> \n> Snake positions: indices: 0: head (3,1), 1: (3,2), 2: (4,2), 3: (4,3), 4: (3,3), 5: (3,4), 6: (2,4), 7: (2,5), 8: (2,6), 9: (3,6), 10: (3,5), 11: (4,5), 12: (4,6), 13: (5,6) tail.\n> \n> So (3,2) is position 1, which is a body segment. If head moves to (3,2), it would be on the same cell as segment 1 before it moves, so collision.\n> \n> Similarly, moving to (4,1): what is at (4,1)? (4,1) is a food position, but let's see if it's occupied.\n> \n> Food is at (4,1), but is (4,1) occupied by snake? Snake positions: head (3,1), body (3,2), (4,2), etc. (4,1) is not in the list, so it should be empty except for food.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,1) is not listed, so probably empty.\n> \n> But (2,4) has food, and (2,4) is in snake positions? Snake has (2,4) at index 6, which is a body segment.\n> \n> (2,4) is occupied by the snake body, but there is food there? The rule says food can spawn under the body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves onto it later.\n> \n> In this state, (2,4) has food, but it's under the snake body at segment 6.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,1) has food and is not under snake, I think.\n> \n> Let's list all cells:\n> \n> - (4,1): food, not occupied by snake? Snake positions: all positions, (4,1) not listed, so free cell with food.\n> \n> - (2,4): food, but snake has segment at (2,4), so food is under body.\n> \n> - (2,3): food, not in snake positions? Snake: (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), etc. (2,3) is not listed, so free cell with food.\n> \n> Snake positions: indices 4 is (3,3), 5 is (3,4), 6 is (2,4), so (2,3) is not occupied, so food at (2,3) is on a free cell.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,4) is occupied by segment 6, so food is under the body.\n> \n> Now, back to possible moves for head at (3,1) direction D.\n> \n> Possible actions: L or R only, since U is reverse and invalid, D is wall.\n> \n> Action L: to (2,1)\n> \n> Action R: to (4,1)\n> \n> Now, (4,1) has food with value +1 and life span 5.\n> \n> If I move to (4,1), I eat the food, so snake grows: head moves to (4,1), and a new segment is added, so tail doesn't move, length increases.\n> \n> But I need to check if it's safe.\n> \n> After moving, the new head position is (4,1), and the body segments: the old head (3,1) becomes part of body, and the tail stays, but since I ate food, tail doesn't move, so the body now includes (3,1) and all previous except tail stays.\n> \n> Let's simulate the move.\n> \n> Current snake: positions [(3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6)]\n> \n> If I move R to (4,1), and since (4,1) has food, I eat it, so new head is (4,1), and the body: the previous head (3,1) is added to the body, so new positions: head (4,1), then (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), and tail (5,6) stays because we added a segment. Length increases by one.\n> \n> Now, is there any collision? Head at (4,1), which was food, not body, so no collision. Now, the body segments: (3,1) is now a body segment, (3,2) is body, etc. No immediate collision.\n> \n> But I need to think about future moves.\n> \n> If I move L to (2,1), that should be empty, no food there, so head moves to (2,1), tail moves to the next, so the last segment (5,6) is removed, and new positions: head (2,1), then (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6) — tail was (5,6), removed, so body from (3,1) to (4,6), but (5,6) is gone, and head is (2,1).\n> \n> After moving L to (2,1) without eating, head to (2,1), then the body: the segment that was head (3,1) becomes new first body, so positions: [(2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6)] — length same, tail at (4,6).\n> \n> Now, (2,1) should be free, no issue.\n> \n> But (2,1) has no food, so no growth.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead. Also, prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> There is food at (4,1) which is very close, life span 5, so it will disappear at turn 45, but since we're at turn 40, we have until turn 44 to eat it.\n> \n> If I move R now to (4,1), I eat it immediately on turn 40.\n> \n> If I don't, I might not get it later.\n> \n> But moving R might be risky? Let's see the grid.\n> \n> Grid size: walls at x=0,7 and y=0,7, so it's an 8x8 grid? x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7, so 8x8, but borders are walls.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (1,6).\n> \n> Snake is long, 14 segments.\n> \n> After eating (4,1), head at (4,1), and direction would be R (since I moved right).\n> \n> Then from (4,1), possible moves: U, D, L, R, but current direction after move is R, so reverse would be L, not allowed.\n> \n> Possible moves:\n> \n> - U: to (4,2) — but (4,2) is occupied by body?

Head (2,1), then (3,1) seg1, (3,2) seg2, (4,2) seg3, (4,3) seg4, (3,3) seg5, (3,4) seg6, (2,4) seg7, (2,5) seg8, etc.\n> \n> So (2,4) is occupied by seg7.\n> \n> When the snake moves, if head moves, say, up to (2,2), then new head (2,2), seg1 to (2,1), seg2 to (3,1), seg3 to (3,2), seg4 to (4,2), seg5 to (4,3), seg6 to (3,3), seg7 to (3,4), seg8 to (2,4), etc.\n> \n> So seg7 was at (2,4), now moves to (3,4), and seg8 moves to (2,4), so (2,4) is still occupied by seg8 now.\n> \n> The body segment on (2,4) changes from seg7 to seg8, but the cell is still occupied.\n> \n> To free (2,4), I need the segment that is on (2,4) to move away and no segment to move to it, which means that (2,4) must not be the position that the next segment moves to.\n> \n> But since the body segments move to the position of the previous segment, (2,4) will be vacated only if the segment that was there moves to a different position, and the next segment moves to where that segment was, not to (2,4) directly.\n> \n> For example, if the segment on (2,4) is seg k, after move, seg k moves to the position of seg k-1, and seg k+1 moves to the position of seg k.\n> \n> But the position of seg k is (2,4), so seg k+1 moves to (2,4).\n> \n> Therefore, as long as there is a segment after, (2,4) will always be occupied by some body segment until the tail passes.\n> \n> When the tail is on (2,4), and it moves away, then (2,4) is free.\n> \n> For example, when the segment on (2,4) is the tail, and it moves, then (2,4) is vacated.\n> \n> In this case, at some point, if (2,4) is the tail position, and the snake moves, tail moves off, then (2,4) is free, and if food is there, head can move to it later.\n> \n> Currently, tail is at (5,6), so it will take many moves for the tail to reach (2,4).\n> \n> The distance from tail to (2,4) is far, so it might take time, and food life span is 7, so it might disappear before.\n> \n> But life span 7 from turn 40, so it has 7 turns.\n> \n> The tail is at (5,6), (2,4) is at (2,4), Manhattan distance |5-2| + |6-4| = 3+2=5, but since the snake is long, it takes at least 5 moves for the tail to move, but the tail moves one step per turn, so to free (2,4), I need the tail to be at (2,4) and move away.\n> \n> But the tail is not at (2,4) now, and it may not go there directly.\n> \n> The path of the tail depends on the head movement.\n> \n> It might be possible to guide the tail to (2,4), but it's complicated and might not be worth it for one food, especially with the life span constraint.\n> \n> Similarly for other food.\n> \n> For long-term survival, I should focus on accessible food and avoid dead ends.\n> \n> Now, at turn 40, moving R to (4,1) allows me to eat food immediately, but then I'm forced to the right, which might lead to a dead end.\n> \n> Moving L to (2,1) lets me go up to eat (2,3) soon, and (2,3) is easy to eat.\n> \n> Also, after eating (2,3), I can move to (1,3) or other places.\n> \n> Moreover, the left side has more space.\n> \n> Let's see the grid: with internal obstacle at (1,6), but at bottom left, (1,1) is free, etc.\n> \n> Also, walls at borders.\n> \n> Now, to maximize score, eating (4,1) and (2,3) both give +1, but (4,1) is closer in a way, but with the risk of going right.\n> \n> But if I go left, I can eat (2,3) in two moves: turn 40 L to (2,1), turn 41 U to (2,2), turn 42 U to (2,3) eat.\n> \n> Then I have +1.\n> \n> If I go right, turn 40 R to (4,1) eat, +1 immediately, but then turn 41 R to (5,1), no food, turn 42 U to (5,2) or R to (6,1), no food nearby.\n> \n> (2,3) is still there, but I'm at (5,2) or something, far away.\n> \n> To go back to (2,3), it might take many turns, and (2,3) life span 10, so possible, but the snake is long, so maneuvering might be tight.\n> \n> For example, from (5,2), to (2,3), I need to go left to x=2, up to y=3.\n> \n> But the body is in the way, so I need to find a path.\n> \n> It might be easier to eat (2,3) first.\n> \n> Also, there is food at (2,4) under body, but it might be hard to eat, so I can ignore it for now.\n> \n> The tail reward danger is not an issue here.\n> \n> So for long-term survival, going left seems better because it has more space and I can eat (2,3) soon.\n> \n> If I go right, I might be trapped in the bottom right.\n> \n> For example, from (5,1), I can go to (6,1), then (7,1) but x=7 wall, so (6,1) to (6,2) or (6,0) wall, so (6,2), etc., but the grid is small, and snake is long, 14 segments, so it might fill the space.\n> \n> But let's estimate the free space.\n> \n> Grid 8x8, 64 cells, walls: borders, but borders are walls, so the playable area is x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? x=0 and x=7 are walls, y=0 and y=7 walls, so cells from (1,1) to (6,6), 6x6=36 cells? x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to6, that's 6x6=36 cells.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (1,6), so 35 free cells?

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State\n\nFirst, let's summarize the current state at Turn 41:\n\n- **Grid Size**: 8x8 (coordinates from (0,0) to (7,7))\n- **Walls**: Borders (x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7) and an internal obstacle at (1,6)\n- **Snake**:\n  - Head at (4,1)\n  - Body segments: [(4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6)]\n  - Current direction: Right (R)\n- **Food**:\n  - (2,4): value +1, life span 6\n  - (2,3): value +1, life span 9\n\n### Immediate Possible Moves\n\nFrom the head at (4,1), moving Right (R) would take the snake to (5,1). Let's check the validity of this move:\n\n1. **Right (R) to (5,1)**:\n   - Is (5,1) a wall? No (x=5 is not a border, y=1 is not a border, and (1,6) is not (5,1)).\n   - Is (5,1) occupied by the snake's body? Checking the body segments: (5,1) is not in the list, so it's free.\n   - Is moving Right allowed? Current direction is Right, so moving Right is allowed (no instant reverse rule violated).\n\nOther possible moves from (4,1):\n\n2. **Up (U) to (4,2)**:\n   - (4,2) is occupied by the snake's body (it's the 4th segment in the list), so this is invalid (collision).\n   \n3. **Down (D) to (4,0)**:\n   - y=0 is a wall, so invalid.\n   \n4. **Left (L) to (3,1)**:\n   - (3,1) is occupied by the snake's body (2nd segment).\n   - Also, moving Left is opposite to the current direction (Right), which violates the no instant reverse rule.\n   \n**Conclusion**: The only valid move at Turn 41 is **Right (R) to (5,1)**.\n\n### Verifying the Thinking Model's Plan\n\nThe Thinking Model's analysis also concludes that the only possible move at Turn 41 is Right (R) to (5,1). It then proceeds to plan subsequent moves to potentially reach the food at (2,4) or (2,3). However, given the complexity and the time constraints (food at (2,4) disappears by Turn 47), it's challenging to devise a path that safely reaches the food in time without colliding with the body or walls.\n\n### Potential Path to Food\n\nLet's briefly consider if there's a path to reach (2,4) by Turn 46 (since its life span is 6 starting at Turn 41):\n\n- **Turn 41**: Move R to (5,1)\n- **Turn 42**: From (5,1), move U to (5,2)\n- **Turn 43**: From (5,2), move U to (5,3)\n- **Turn 44**: From (5,3), move L to (4,3) → but (4,3) is occupied by the body at this time.\n  \nThis path fails because (4,3) is occupied. Alternative paths also seem blocked by the snake's body, making it impossible to reach (2,4) in time.\n\n### Alternative Strategy: Survive and Seek Other Food\n\nGiven that reaching (2,4) is impractical, the next best option is to:\n\n1. **Avoid Collisions**: Ensure the snake doesn't collide with its body or walls.\n2. **Seek Open Space**: Move towards areas with more free space to allow future flexibility.\n3. **Consider (2,3) Food**: This food has a longer life span (until Turn 50), but reaching it is also non-trivial due to body obstructions.\n\nFrom (5,1), moving Right to (5,1) is the only option. Subsequent moves would involve navigating upwards or further right to avoid immediate collisions, but without a clear path to food, the priority is survival.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nGiven the constraints and the immediate state, the only safe and valid move at Turn 41 is to move **Right (R)** to (5,1).\n\n\\boxed{R}",

Since direction is R, next move should be to (6,1), but let's check if that's valid.\n> \n> Possible moves from head position (5,1):\n> \n> - Up: (5,2)\n> \n> - Down: (5,0) but y=0 is wall, so invalid.\n> \n> - Left: (4,1) but that's the second segment, which is the neck. Since the snake is moving, the tail will move away, so moving left to (4,1) might be possible if the tail moves, but (4,1) is currently occupied by the body, but after the move, the tail will vacate that spot? No.\n> \n> Important: When the snake moves, the head goes to a new cell, and the tail end is removed. So, if I move left to (4,1), which is currently occupied by the second segment, after moving, that cell might be free if the tail moves, but since we're moving the head, the tail only moves if we eat food; otherwise, the tail stays or moves?\n> \n> Standard snake movement: When you move without eating, head moves to new cell, tail is removed from the end. When you eat, head moves to food, tail grows, so no removal.\n> \n> In this case, if I move to a cell that is currently occupied by the body, but it might be vacated by the tail moving.\n> \n> Specifically, for (4,1), it's the second segment. If I move left to (4,1), at that moment, the head would be colliding with the body unless that segment moves away.\n> \n> But in snake, when you move, the body follows, so the segment at (4,1) will move to where the head was or something. Let's think carefully.\n> \n> At turn start, positions: head (5,1), then (4,1), (3,1), etc.\n> \n> If I move left to (4,1), but (4,1) is currently occupied by the body, so if I move there, head would be on the same cell as body, causing collision.\n> \n> But after the move, the body should shift. The sequence is: head moves first to new position, then each segment moves to the previous position of the next segment.\n> \n> So, if head moves to (4,1), but (4,1) is currently occupied by segment 2, so at the moment of movement, before shifting, head and segment 2 are both on (4,1), which is collision.\n> \n> Therefore, moving to a cell that is currently occupied by any body segment except possibly the tail is deadly, because it causes collision.\n> \n> The tail is different: if you move to the current tail position, since the tail will move away (if no growth), it might be safe, but only if it's the very end.\n> \n> In this case, the tail is at (4,6). But from (5,1), moving to tail is not adjacent.\n> \n> From head (5,1), adjacent cells:\n> \n> - Right: (6,1) - but x=7 is wall, so x=6 is border? Walls are x=0 and x=7, so x=6 is not wall, but y=0 and y=7 are walls. Grid is from x=0 to x=7, but walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls, so not accessible.\n> \n> Thus, from (5,1):\n> \n> - Up: (5,2) - is this free? Let's see what's at (5,2).\n> \n> From snake positions: (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6)\n> \n> So positions: let's list all occupied cells:\n> \n> - (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6)\n> \n> (5,2) is not in this list, so it should be free, assuming no food or wall.\n> \n> Food is at (2,4) and (2,3), so (5,2) is empty.\n> \n> - Down: (5,0) - but y=0 is wall, so invalid.\n> \n> - Left: (4,1) - currently occupied by body segment, so moving there would cause collision.\n> \n> - Right: (6,1) - x=6, y=1. x=6 is not wall? Walls: x=0 or x=7 are walls, so x=6 is within 1 to 6, y=1 is within 1 to 6, so (6,1) should be free? Is (6,1) occupied? Not in snake positions, and no food mentioned, so probably free.\n> \n> But y=0 is wall, y=1 is not wall. Walls are y=0 and y=7, so y=1 to y=6 are playable.\n> \n> Similarly, x=1 to x=6 playable, except internal obstacle at (1,6).\n> \n> (1,6) is obstacle, but (6,1) is not near that.\n> \n> So from (5,1), possible moves:\n> \n> - U: (5,2) - free\n> \n> - D: (5,0) - wall, invalid\n> \n> - L: (4,1) - body, collision\n> \n> - R: (6,1) - free\n> \n> Also, no instant reverse: current direction is R, so I cannot move left (L) because that would be opposite. Rule: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\"\n> \n> Current direction is R, so opposite is L, so I cannot move L on this turn. But L is invalid anyway because it's body.\n> \n> So valid moves are U or R.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan a sequence of actions for multiple turns.\n> \n> First, let's understand the food.\n> \n> Food at (2,4): value +1, life span 5. Current turn 42, so if not eaten, disappears after 5 turns, meaning on turn 47 it's gone. Life span decreases each turn, including current, so after turn 42, life span 4 left, then 3,2,1,0 on turn 46? Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So at turn 42, life span is 5, meaning it will be present for 5 more turns? Or including current?\n> \n> \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" so at turn t, with life span L, it decreases to L-1 at turn t+1, and disappears when countdown reaches 0.\n> \n> Typically, if life span is N at turn t, it will disappear after N turns, so available from turn t to turn t + N - 1, and gone on turn t + N.\n> \n> For example, at turn 42, life span 5, so countdown: turn 42: 5, turn 43:4, turn 44:3, turn 45:2, turn 46:1, turn 47:0, gone. So can be eaten on turns 42 to 46 inclusive.\n> \n> Similarly for the other food at (2,3), life span 8, so available from turn 42 to turn 49, gone on turn 50.\n> \n> But (2,4) is currently occupied? Food can spawn under snake body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves onto it.\n> \n> Look at snake positions: (2,4) is part of the snake! It's the 9th segment: positions index 0 is head, so (2,4) is the segment at index 8? Let's list with indices:\n> \n> 0: (5,1) head\n> \n> 1: (4,1)\n> \n> 2: (3,1)\n> \n> 3: (3,2)\n> \n> 4: (4,2)\n> \n> 5: (4,3)\n> \n> 6: (3,3)\n> \n> 7: (3,4)\n> \n> 8: (2,4)\n> \n> 9: (2,5)\n> \n> 10: (2,6)\n> \n> 11: (3,6)\n> \n> 12: (3,5)\n> \n> 13: (4,5)\n> \n> 14: (4,6) tail\n> \n> So (2,4) is occupied by segment 8, which is not the tail. The tail is at (4,6).\n> \n> Food is at (2,4), but it's under the snake body. So to eat it, we need to move the body away from (2,4) and then have the head move there.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (2,3), which is not occupied, I think. (2,3) not in snake positions, so it's free.\n> \n> (2,3) is not listed, so it should be accessible, but we need to go there.\n> \n> First, let's think about immediate action for turn 42.\n> \n> Head at (5,1), direction R.\n> \n> Valid moves: U to (5,2) or R to (6,1).\n> \n> If I move R to (6,1), that's towards the right wall. x=6 is not wall, but x=7 is wall, so (6,1) is playable.\n> \n> Then from there, I could go up or down or left, but not right since x=7 is wall.\n> \n> If I move U to (5,2), which is up.\n> \n> Now, I need to think about getting to the food.\n> \n> Food at (2,3) and (2,4), but (2,4) is under body, so tricky.\n> \n> (2,4) has short life, only 5 turns left, so we might want to eat it soon if possible.\n> \n> But to eat (2,4), we need to vacate that cell first.\n> \n> Currently, (2,4) is occupied by segment 8. When the snake moves, segments shift. The tail is at (4,6), so if we don't eat food, the tail will move, and segments will shift.\n> \n> But (2,4) is not the tail; it's in the middle.\n> \n> To vacate (2,4), we need the snake to move such that segment 8 moves away, but since the snake moves as a whole, (2,4) will only be vacated if the segment that is there moves to the next position, which depends on the path.\n> \n> Perhaps I should simulate the snake movement.\n> \n> First, let's think about the grid layout.\n> \n> Grid size: walls at x=0,7 and y=0,7, so playable area x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, 6x6 grid.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (1,6), so that cell is blocked.\n> \n> So available cells: all (x,y) with 1<=x<=6, 1<=y<=6, except (1,6).\n> \n> Now, snake body occupies 15 cells, so many cells are occupied.\n> \n> Free cells: total cells 36 minus walls/obstacles: walls are borders, but the border cells are walls, so the playable cells are the inner 6x6 minus (1,6), so 36 - 1 = 35 cells? 6x6=36, minus (1,6) obstacle, so 35 cells.\n> \n> Snake occupies 15, so 20 free cells, but food is on two, so 18 empty, but food can be on free cells or under body.\n> \n> Food at (2,4) is under body, food at (2,3) is on free cell, I think.\n> \n> (2,3) is not in snake positions, so it should be free, with food.\n> \n> Now, to eat (2,4), since it's under body, we need to move so that the body leaves (2,4), then head moves there.\n> \n> But when the body leaves, if we move the head there immediately, it might work, but we have to time it.\n> \n> Also, \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> But in this case, the food is not on tail, it's on a body segment.\n> \n> So for (2,4), it's not tail, so if we eat it, the snake grows, so that segment becomes part of body, no issue, I think.\n> \n> The danger is only if food is on tail and head is adjacent.\n> \n> Here, tail is at (4,6), no food there.\n> \n> So for (2,4), we can eat it once it's vacated.\n> \n> But how to vacate it.\n> \n> Let me list the snake positions in order:\n> \n> From head: (5,1) - R\n> \n> 1: (4,1) - L? Direction: head moving R, so from (5,1) to (4,1) would be left, but the positions are given, so the direction is the current head direction, which is R, meaning it just moved to (5,1) from left, I assume.\n> \n> The state says \"Snake Positions\" and \"Snake Head Direction: R\", so at turn 42, head at (5,1), direction R, so it came from (4,1), I think, but in positions, (4,1) is the next segment.\n> \n> The positions list is [head, segment1, segment2, ..., tail], so at turn 42, head is at (5,1), and it moved there from previous position, with direction R, so previous head was at (4,1), moved right to (5,1).\n> \n> Then segment1 is at (4,1), which was previous head, and so on.\n> \n> To vacate (2,4), which is segment8, we need the snake to move so that this segment moves to the next position.\n> \n> But the next position depends on the movement of the previous segments.\n> \n> Since the snake moves by shifting, each segment moves to the position of the next segment in the chain when the head moves.\n> \n> When head moves to a new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the segment closer to the head.\n> \n> For example, when head moves from (5,1) to new position, segment1 moves to (5,1), segment2 moves to where segment1 was, and so on, tail moves to where the second last was, and if no growth, the old tail position is vacated.\n> \n> So for cell (2,4), it is currently occupied by segment8. When the snake moves, segment8 will move to the position that segment9 is at now, which is (2,5), because segment9 is at (2,5).\n> \n> Similarly, segment9 will move to where segment10 is, etc.\n> \n> After one move, segment8 will be at (2,5), and (2,4) will be occupied by segment7, which is at (3,4) now, so (3,4) moves to (2,4) if the head moves in a way that the chain shifts accordingly.\n> \n> Let's simulate one move.\n> \n> Suppose at turn 42, I move the head to a new position.\n> \n> Case 1: Move R to (6,1)\n> \n> Then new positions: head at (6,1)\n> \n> Segment1 moves to old head position (5,1)\n> \n> Segment2 moves to old segment1 position (4,1)\n> \n> Segment3 moves to old segment2 position (3,1)\n> \n> Segment4 moves to old segment3 position (3,2)\n> \n> Segment5 moves to old segment4 position (4,2)\n> \n> Segment6 moves to old segment5 position (4,3)\n> \n> Segment7 moves to old segment6 position (3,3)\n> \n> Segment8 moves to old segment7 position (3,4)  // segment7 was at (3,4), so segment8 moves to (3,4)\n> \n> Segment9 moves to old segment8 position (2,4)  // segment8 was at (2,4), so segment9 moves to (2,4)\n> \n> But segment9 was at (2,5), so it moves to (2,4)\n> \n> Let's list old positions:\n> \n> Index: pos\n> \n> 0: (5,1) head\n> \n> 1: (4,1)\n> \n> 2: (3,1)\n> \n> 3: (3,2)\n> \n> 4: (4,2)\n> \n> 5: (4,3)\n> \n> 6: (3,3)\n> \n> 7: (3,4)\n> \n> 8: (2,4)\n> \n> 9: (2,5)\n> \n> 10: (2,6)\n> \n> 11: (3,6)\n> \n> 12: (3,5)\n> \n> 13: (4,5)\n> \n> 14: (4,6) tail\n> \n> After head moves to (6,1):\n> \n> New head: (6,1)\n> \n> Then:\n> \n> Segment1: moves to old head pos (5,1)\n> \n> Segment2: moves to old seg1 pos (4,1)\n> \n> Segment3: moves to old seg2 pos (3,1)\n> \n> Segment4: moves to old seg3 pos (3,2)\n> \n> Segment5: moves to old seg4 pos (4,2)\n> \n> Segment6: moves to old seg5 pos (4,3)\n> \n> Segment7: moves to old seg6 pos (3,3)\n> \n> Segment8: moves to old seg7 pos (3,4)  // old seg7 is (3,4)\n> \n> Segment9: moves to old seg8 pos (2,4)  // old seg8 is (2,4)\n> \n> Segment10: moves to old seg9 pos (2,5)\n> \n> Segment11: moves to old seg10 pos (2,6)\n> \n> Segment12: moves to old seg11 pos (3,6)\n> \n> Segment13: moves to old seg12 pos (3,5)\n> \n> Segment14: moves to old seg13 pos (4,5)  // tail was seg14 at (4,6), but it moves to old seg13 pos (4,5), and old tail position (4,6) is vacated.\n> \n> The tail segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so seg14 moves to where seg13 was, which is (4,5).\n> \n> And the cell (4,6) is now free, since no one is there.\n> \n> Now, for (2,4): after this move, it is occupied by segment9, who moved there from (2,5).

(2,4) is seg8, tail is seg14, so 7 segments including seg8 to seg14.\n> \n> To make (2,4) the tail, we need to have the snake move without eating for several turns, so that the tail shortens to that point.\n> \n> But when we move without eating, the tail is removed, but the body doesn't shorten from the middle; the tail end is removed each turn, so the segment that was the tail is removed, but the body segments remain until they become tail.\n> \n> For example, after k moves without eating, the first k segments from the tail end are removed, so the tail moves forward in the chain.\n> \n> After one move without eating, the tail is removed, so the new tail is the previous second last segment.\n> \n> In this case, after one move, as above, the new tail is at old seg13 position, which was (4,5) if we moved to (6,1), or similarly.\n> \n> But the cell (2,4) is still occupied.\n> \n> To vacate the cell (2,4), we need the segment that is there to be the tail, and then we move without eating, so that cell is vacated.\n> \n> Currently, the segment at (2,4) is seg8. It will become the tail after 7 moves without eating, because there are 6 segments after it (seg9 to seg14), so after 6 moves, seg14 is removed, seg13 becomes tail, and so on, after 7 moves, seg8 would be the tail.\n> \n> Then on the 8th move without eating, if we move, seg8 (tail) is removed, and (2,4) is vacated.\n> \n> But that would take many turns, and the food at (2,4) has only 5 turns left, so by turn 46 it's gone. Turn 42 now, so we have turns 42,43,44,45,46 to eat it. On turn 46 it can be eaten if life span 1, then on turn 47 it disappears.\n> \n> But to vacate (2,4), we need to make it the tail and then move, which takes at least 7 moves without eating, so by turn 49, but food is gone by 47, so impossible to eat (2,4) because we can't vacate it in time. Is that right?\n> \n> After 7 moves without eating, on turn 49, seg8 would be the tail, then on turn 50, if we move without eating, (2,4) is vacated, but food is gone by turn 47, so on turn 50 it's too late. And on turn 46, when food is still there, (2,4) is occupied, so we can't eat it.\n> \n> Therefore, it's impossible to eat the food at (2,4) because it's under the body and we can't vacate it before it disappears.\n> \n> Is that correct?\n> \n> Perhaps if we eat other food, we grow, so the body extends, and (2,4) might never become tail.\n> \n> For example, if we eat the food at (2,3), we grow, so the tail doesn't move, and (2,4) remains occupied.\n> \n> But we need to vacate (2,4) to eat it, which requires not growing and moving many times.\n> \n> But with only 5 turns, and 7 moves needed, it's not possible.\n> \n> Moreover, the food at (2,4) has life span 5, so last chance to eat is turn 46.\n> \n> But on turn 46, if (2,4) is not vacated, we can't eat it.\n> \n> Since it's occupied and not tail, it won't be vacated by then.\n> \n> Therefore, I think it's impossible to eat the food at (2,4).

avoiding the crowded body cluster on the left, which reduces collision risk and prioritizes long-term survival. Continuing upward explores safer areas while allowing time for the snake body to shift and potentially free up occupied food cells like (4,2) for future consumption.\n",

That means the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), but with an internal obstacle at (1,6).\n> \n> Current turn is 44. Snake positions: head at (6,2), direction is right (R), so last move was to the right. Body segments: (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5).

So at turn 44, life span 3 means it has 3 turns left: after turn 44, it has 2 left; after 45, 1; after 46, gone. Similarly, life span 6: after 44, 5 left; ...; after 49, gone.\n> \n> - (4,2) with value 1, life span 9. Disappears after turn 52 (44 + 9 - 1? Let's calculate properly: if life span is N at turn t, it disappears after t + N - 1 turns? No.\n> \n> The rule: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So for food at turn t with life span L, it will be present for L turns including t. So at turn t, countdown is L; turn t+1, countdown L-1; ... turn t + L - 1, countdown 1; then at turn t + L, it disappears.\n> \n> For (2,4): life span 3 at turn 44.

Priority is long-term survival over immediate rewards.\n> \n> First, let's map the grid. Walls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, so we can only be on x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6. Internal obstacle at (1,6), so that cell is blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (6,2), moving right. But x=7 is wall, so moving right to (7,2) is invalid, collision. So I cannot move right.\n> \n> Current direction is R, but since x=6, moving right to (7,2) is out of bounds, wall. So right is not possible. Also, no instant reverse: since last move was right, I cannot move left immediately, because left would be opposite direction.\n> \n> Directions: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), L (left, x-1), R (right, x+1).\n> \n> Current head at (6,2), direction R. So possible moves: not opposite, so cannot move L (left). Can move U (up to (6,3)), D (down to (6,1)), or R, but R to (7,2) is wall, invalid.\n> \n> So only possible moves from current position: U or D.\n> \n> U: (6,2) to (6,3)\n> \n> D: (6,2) to (6,1)\n> \n> Now, check if these cells are occupied by body or obstacles.\n> \n> First, (6,3): is it in snake positions?

So (6,3) is not in the list, and not wall except borders, x=6,y=3 is within 1-6, and no internal obstacle there. (1,6) is obstacle, but (6,3) is fine.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,1): not in snake positions, not wall.\n> \n> But (6,1) might be close to body? Let's see: body has (5,1), which is adjacent, but moving to (6,1) is not colliding with body because when I move, the body will also move.\n> \n> Collision: head touches any body segment except that it can move to the tail cell because tail moves away.\n> \n> In this case, if I move to (6,1), the current tail is (3,5), so (6,1) is not a body segment except possibly.\n> \n> Current body segments: positions from index 1 to 14: (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5)\n> \n> (6,1) is not in this list. Similarly, (6,3) not in list.\n> \n> Also, walls: (6,1) is y=1, but border walls are x=0,7 or y=0,7, so (6,1) has x=6 (not 0 or 7), y=1 (not 0 or 7), so not border wall. Internal obstacle only at (1,6), so (6,1) is free.\n> \n> Similarly for (6,3).\n> \n> So both U and D are possible moves.\n> \n> Now, food: (2,4), (2,3), (4,2)\n> \n> (2,4) is currently occupied by the snake? Snake positions include (2,4) at index 10: (2,4) is part of the body. But food can be under body, and can be eaten only when body moves away and head moves there.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,2) is also in snake positions?

But if eat food, tail grows, so new tail added.\n> \n> Currently no food eaten, so moving to (6,3): new positions: head (6,3), then body: (6,2), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6) — and (3,5) is gone?

Positions: head (6,3), then (6,2), (5,2), ..., up to (2,6), and (3,6) is the 14th, but old tail was (3,5), which is removed, so the new body has 14 segments? No: the list has 15 positions, after move, new head, and the first 14 of the old body, but since tail is removed, the new snake has the same length, 15 segments? Let's count indices.\n> \n> Old positions: index 0: head (6,2), index 1: (5,2), index 2: (5,1), ..., index 14: (3,5)\n> \n> After move, new head at (6,3), then the segments from index 0 to 13 become the new body positions: so new position 1: old head (6,2), new position 2: old index 1 (5,2), ..., new position 14: old index 13 (3,6), and old index 14 (3,5) is gone.\n> \n> So new snake: head (6,3), body: (6,2), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6)\n> \n> Length still 15, but the tail is now (3,6).\n> \n> Similarly, if I move down to (6,1): new head (6,1), body: (6,2), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6) — tail (3,6).\n> \n> Now, after moving, the food under body might become accessible if the body moves away.\n> \n> For example, (4,2) is food, but in the body, at index 6 in old positions, which is (4,2). After move, if I move U or D, the body shifts, so (4,2) might be occupied or not.\n> \n> In new positions after U move: the cells are (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6)\n> \n> (4,2) is still occupied, at position 7 (since head 0, then 1:(6,2), 2:(5,2), 3:(5,1), 4:(4,1), 5:(3,1), 6:(3,2), 7:(4,2), etc.)\n> \n> Similarly, (2,4) is at position 11: (2,4)\n> \n> So both are still under body.\n> \n> (2,3) is free food.\n> \n> Now, to eat (2,3), I need to get the head there.\n> \n> (2,3) is at (2,3), which is adjacent to (2,4) but (2,4) is body.\n> \n> From current position (6,2), moving U to (6,3) or D to (6,1) doesn't directly help.\n> \n> I need to plan a path to the food.\n> \n> Also, there is a risk with (2,4) food because it's under the body, and if I eat it when head is adjacent to tail, it might cause collision due to tail growth.\n> \n> But currently, tail is at (3,5), head at (6,2), not adjacent.\n> \n> Adjacent means sharing a side, so (6,2) and (3,5) are not adjacent; they are far.\n> \n> But after moves, things change.\n> \n> First, let's consider the two options: U or D.\n> \n> Option 1: Move U to (6,3) at turn 44.\n> \n> Then head at (6,3), direction U (since I moved up).\n> \n> From there, possible moves: not opposite, so cannot move D (down). Can move U (to (6,4)), L (left to (5,3)), or R (right to (7,3) but x=7 wall, invalid).\n> \n> So possible U, L.\n> \n> U: (6,4), L: (5,3)\n> \n> Now, (6,4): not body? New body positions: (6,2), (5,2), etc., (6,4) not in list, not wall.\n> \n> (5,3): not in body positions? Body has (5,2), (4,3), etc., (5,3) not listed, so free.\n> \n> Similarly, if I had moved D to (6,1) at turn 44, head at (6,1), direction D.\n> \n> Then from (6,1), possible moves: not opposite, so cannot move U (up). Can move D (to (6,0) but y=0 wall, invalid), L (left to (5,1)), or R (right to (7,1) wall, invalid).\n> \n> (5,1) is in body? New positions after D move: head (6,1), body (6,2), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), etc. So (5,1) is position 3 in body, so moving to (5,1) would be collision with body.\n> \n> When moving, the head moves to a cell, and if that cell is occupied by a body segment, it's collision, except if it's the tail cell and tail moves away.\n> \n> In this case, for move to (5,1): current positions have (5,1) as a body segment. After the snake moves, the tail moves away, so the cell (5,1) might be free or not.\n> \n> Let's think carefully.\n> \n> At turn 44, before move, positions: head (6,2), body includes (5,1) at index 2.\n> \n> If I move down to (6,1), new head is (6,1). The new body: first segment is old head (6,2), then old index 1 (5,2), then old index 2 (5,1)? No.\n> \n> After move, new positions: new head at (6,1), then new body segments: the old head becomes new position 1: (6,2), old position 1 becomes new position 2: (5,2), old position 2 becomes new position 3: (5,1), and so on, up to old position 13: (3,6), and old position 14: (3,5) is gone.\n> \n> So (5,1) is now at new position 3, which is part of the body.\n> \n> If I want to move to (5,1) from (6,1), but (5,1) is occupied by the body at that time, so moving there would cause collision, because it's not the tail; the tail is now (3,6) or something.\n> \n> New tail is old position 13: (3,6).\n> \n> So (5,1) is not the tail, it's a body segment, so moving to (5,1) would have head collide with body.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,0) is wall, (7,1) wall, so from (6,1) after moving down, the only possible move is left to (5,1), but it's occupied, or down to (6,0) wall, or right wall, so actually, after moving down to (6,1), I have no valid moves? That can't be right.\n> \n> From (6,1), after the move, the cell (5,1) is occupied by the body, but can I move to it?\n> \n> The rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> In this case, (5,1) is not the tail; the tail is (3,6), which is far. So (5,1) is a body segment, so moving to (5,1) would cause collision and death.\n> \n> Therefore, from (6,1), after moving down, the only adjacent cells are (6,0) down (wall), (7,1) right (wall), (5,1) left (body, not tail), (6,2) up, but (6,2) is now the first body segment, so occupied.\n> \n> After moving to (6,1), the new positions have (6,2) as position 1, so (6,2) is occupied, and (5,1) is position 3, occupied.\n> \n> So from head at (6,1), the cells:\n> \n> - Up: (6,2) - occupied by body\n> \n> - Down: (6,0) - wall\n> \n> - Left: (5,1) - occupied by body\n> \n> - Right: (7,1) - wall\n> \n> All possible moves are invalid. If I try to move to (6,2), it's body, collision. Similarly for others.\n> \n> But moving to (6,2) would be reverse, but even if not, it's occupied.\n> \n> So after moving down to (6,1) at turn 44, the snake is trapped and will die on the next turn, as there are no valid moves.\n> \n> Therefore, moving down to (6,1) is suicidal and must be avoided.\n> \n> So only possible move at turn 44 is up to (6,3).\n> \n> I must move up to (6,3) to avoid immediate death.\n> \n> Then at turn 44, action U.\n> \n> Now, turn 44: move U to (6,3)\n> \n> Then new state: head at (6,3), direction U.\n> \n> Body: (6,2), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5) — old tail (3,5) is gone, new tail is (3,6) or what?\n> \n> Old positions: indices 0 to 14.\n> \n> After move U: new head (6,3)\n> \n> New body: old index 0 to 13: (6,2), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6)\n> \n> Old index 14 (3,5) is removed.\n> \n> So new snake: head (6,3), then segments: (6,2), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6) — that's 14 body segments, so 15 in total?

Since current turn is 44, it will be gone by turn 47.\n> \n> - (2,3) with value 1, life span 6. Disappears after turn 49 (44 + 6 - 1? Life span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 44, life span 3 means it has 3 turns left: after turn 44, it has 2 left; after 45, 1; after 46, gone. Similarly, life span 6: after 44, 5 left; ...; after 49, gone.\n> \n> - (4,2) with value 1, life span 9. Disappears after turn 52 (44 + 9 - 1? Let's calculate properly: if life span is N at turn t, it disappears after t + N - 1 turns? No.\n> \n> The rule: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So for food at turn t with life span L, it will be present for L turns including t. So at turn t, countdown is L; turn t+1, countdown L-1; ... turn t + L - 1, countdown 1; then at turn t + L, it disappears.\n> \n> For (2,4): life span 3 at turn 44.

Priority is long-term survival over immediate rewards.\n> \n> First, let's map the grid. Walls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, so we can only be on x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6. Internal obstacle at (1,6), so that cell is blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (6,2), moving right. But x=7 is wall, so moving right to (7,2) is invalid, collision. So I cannot move right.\n> \n> Current direction is R, but since x=6, moving right to (7,2) is out of bounds, wall. So right is not possible. Also, no instant reverse: since last move was right, I cannot move left immediately, because left would be opposite direction.\n> \n> Directions: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), L (left, x-1), R (right, x+1).\n> \n> Current head at (6,2), direction R. So possible moves: not opposite, so cannot move L (left).

Snake: (6,2) head, then (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5). So (6,3) is not in the list, and not wall except borders, x=6,y=3 is within 1-6, and no internal obstacle there. (1,6) is obstacle, but (6,3) is fine.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,1): not in snake positions, not wall.\n> \n> But (6,1) might be close to body? Let's see: body has (5,1), which is adjacent, but moving to (6,1) is not colliding with body because when I move, the body will also move.\n> \n> Collision: head touches any body segment except that it can move to the tail cell because tail moves away.\n> \n> In this case, if I move to (6,1), the current tail is (3,5), so (6,1) is not a body segment except possibly.\n> \n> Current body segments: positions from index 1 to 14: (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5)\n> \n> (6,1) is not in this list. Similarly, (6,3) not in list.\n> \n> Also, walls: (6,1) is y=1, but border walls are x=0,7 or y=0,7, so (6,1) has x=6 (not 0 or 7), y=1 (not 0 or 7), so not border wall. Internal obstacle only at (1,6), so (6,1) is free.\n> \n> Similarly for (6,3).\n> \n> So both U and D are possible moves.\n> \n> Now, food: (2,4), (2,3), (4,2)\n> \n> (2,4) is currently occupied by the snake? Snake positions include (2,4) at index 10: (2,4) is part of the body. But food can be under body, and can be eaten only when body moves away and head moves there.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,2) is also in snake positions? Index 6: (4,2) is a body segment.\n> \n> (4,2) is listed as food, but it's under the snake body.\n> \n> Food positions: (2,4), (2,3), (4,2)\n> \n> (2,4) is occupied by snake at position 10: (2,4)\n> \n> (4,2) is occupied by snake at position 6: (4,2)\n> \n> (2,3) is not in snake positions, so it's free.\n> \n> But (2,3) has food with value 1.\n> \n> Now, for (2,4) and (4,2), since they are under body, I can only eat them if the body moves away and then head moves there.\n> \n> But for now, I need to plan moves.\n> \n> Since I'm at (6,2), with only U and D possible.\n> \n> Let me sketch the grid.\n> \n> Grid from x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6.\n> \n> Walls: borders, and (1,6) obstacle.\n> \n> Snake: head (6,2), body: (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5)\n> \n> So let's list cells:\n> \n> Row y=6: x=1: obstacle? (1,6) is obstacle, but y=6 is top row. Walls include border y=7, but y=7 is above, so y=6 is within, but (1,6) is internal obstacle.\n> \n> y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=1 to 6 are playable, but (1,6) is blocked.\n> \n> Similarly, x=0 and x=7 walls.\n> \n> So for y=6: x=1 blocked, x=2: (2,6) snake, x=3: (3,6) snake, x=4,5,6 free? (4,6) not listed, etc.\n> \n> But I don't need the full grid, just for planning.\n> \n> Food: (2,4) under snake, (2,3) free, (4,2) under snake.\n> \n> (2,3) is at (2,3), which is free and has food.\n> \n> Now, from head (6,2), I can go up to (6,3) or down to (6,1).\n> \n> I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> First, let's consider moving up to (6,3).\n> \n> Then new head position (6,3). Body: the tail (3,5) will move to? When snake moves, head moves to new position, each segment moves to previous position, so tail at (3,5) will be cut off or something? No, when not eating, snake moves, head to new cell, each body segment to previous position, so tail is removed. But if eat food, tail grows, so new tail added.\n> \n> Currently no food eaten, so moving to (6,3): new positions: head (6,3), then body: (6,2), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6) — and (3,5) is gone? Let's see: the snake has 15 segments. When moving without eating, the head moves to new cell, and the tail cell is abandoned.\n> \n> So from positions: [ (6,2), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5) ]\n> \n> After move U to (6,3): new head (6,3), then the first body segment is the old head (6,2), then (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6) — and the last one (3,5) is not included, so tail is now (3,6). Positions: head (6,3), then (6,2), (5,2), ..., up to (2,6), and (3,6) is the 14th, but old tail was (3,5), which is removed, so the new body has 14 segments? No: the list has 15 positions, after move, new head, and the first 14 of the old body, but since tail is removed, the new snake has the same length, 15 segments? Let's count indices.\n> \n> Old positions: index 0: head (6,2), index 1: (5,2), index 2: (5,1), ..., index 14: (3,5)\n> \n> After move, new head at (6,3), then the segments from index 0 to 13 become the new body positions: so new position 1: old head (6,2), new position 2: old index 1 (5,2), ..., new position 14: old index 13 (3,6), and old index 14 (3,5) is gone.\n> \n> So new snake: head (6,3), body: (6,2), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6)\n> \n> Length still 15, but the tail is now (3,6).\n> \n> Similarly, if I move down to (6,1): new head (6,1), body: (6,2), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6) — tail (3,6).\n> \n> Now, after moving, the food under body might become accessible if the body moves away.\n> \n> For example, (4,2) is food, but in the body, at index 6 in old positions, which is (4,2).

But it's under body, and head didn't move to it, so not eaten.\n> \n> Similarly, other food not eaten.\n> \n> But I need to eat food to score.\n> \n> All food has life span 1, so if not eaten this turn, lost forever.\n> \n> But how can I eat them?\n> \n> For example, food at (2,4) is under snake body at position 12. When the snake moves, if that segment moves away, but in this case, when I move, the tail moves from (2,6) to (2,5) or something, but (2,4) is not the tail.\n> \n> In the shift, the segment at (2,4) will move to where? After the move, the body shifts, so the segment that was at index 12 (2,4) will move to the position of index 11 (3,4)? Let's see.\n> \n> After moving head to (5,4), the new segments:\n> \n> Index 0: (5,4) new head\n> \n> Index 1: (5,3) was old head\n> \n> Index 2: (6,3) was index 1\n> \n> Index 3: (6,2) was index 2\n> \n> Index 4: (5,2) was index 3\n> \n> Index 5: (5,1) was index 4\n> \n> Index 6: (4,1) was index 5\n> \n> Index 7: (3,1) was index 6\n> \n> Index 8: (3,2) was index 7\n> \n> Index 9: (4,2) was index 8\n> \n> Index 10: (4,3) was index 9\n> \n> Index 11: (3,3) was index 10\n> \n> Index 12: (3,4) was index 11\n> \n> Index 13: (2,4) was index 12? Index 12 was (2,4), but now it moves to where index 11 was, which is (3,4)? No.\n> \n> The body segments shift forward: the segment that was at position k moves to position k-1 for k>0, but the positions: the segment that was at index 1 moves to where index 0 was, etc.\n> \n> After moving head to new position, the first body segment (index 1) moves to the old head position, index 2 moves to where index 1 was, and so on, up to the tail.\n> \n> So for position (2,4), it was index 12. After move, the segment that was at index 12 will move to where index 11 was, which is (3,4), so the cell (2,4) is vacated, but only if no food is eaten; since no food eaten, tail is removed, so the segment at index 14 (2,6) is removed, and all segments shift.\n> \n> Specifically: after moving to (5,4) without eating, new snake:\n> \n> - Head: (5,4)\n> \n> - Body 1: (5,3)  // old head\n> \n> - Body 2: (6,3)  // was index 1\n> \n> - Body 3: (6,2)  // was index 2\n> \n> - Body 4: (5,2)  // was index 3\n> \n> - Body 5: (5,1)  // was index 4\n> \n> - Body 6: (4,1)  // was index 5\n> \n> - Body 7: (3,1)  // was index 6\n> \n> - Body 8: (3,2)  // was index 7\n> \n> - Body 9: (4,2)  // was index 8\n> \n> - Body 10: (4,3)  // was index 9\n> \n> - Body 11: (3,3)  // was index 10\n> \n> - Body 12: (3,4)  // was index 11\n> \n> - Body 13: (2,4)  // was index 12? Index 12 was (2,4), but after shift, the segment that was at index 12 moves to where index 11 was, which is (3,4), so new index 12 is (3,4) from old index 11.\n> \n> Old positions:\n> 0: (5,3)\n> 1: (6,3)\n> 2: (6,2)\n> 3: (5,2)\n> 4: (5,1)\n> 5: (4,1)\n> 6: (3,1)\n> 7: (3,2)\n> 8: (4,2)\n> 9: (4,3)\n> 10: (3,3)\n> 11: (3,4)\n> 12: (2,4)\n> 13: (2,5)\n> 14: (2,6)\n> \n> After move to (5,4) and no eat, head new at (5,4), then body:\n> - Index 1: old head (5,3)\n> - Index 2: old index 1 (6,3)\n> - Index 3: old index 2 (6,2)\n> - Index 4: old index 3 (5,2)\n> - Index 5: old index 4 (5,1)\n> - Index 6: old index 5 (4,1)\n> - Index 7: old index 6 (3,1)\n> - Index 8: old index 7 (3,2)\n> - Index 9: old index 8 (4,2)\n> - Index 10: old index 9 (4,3)\n> - Index 11: old index 10 (3,3)\n> - Index 12: old index 11 (3,4)\n> - Index 13: old index 12 (2,4)\n> - Index 14: old index 13 (2,5)  // and old index 14 (2,6) is removed\n> \n> So new positions: head (5,4), then (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5)\n> \n> (2,4) is still occupied, by the body at index 13 now.\n> \n> Food at (2,4) was there, but since the body moved away? No, the body is still at (2,4) after the move? In new positions, (2,4) is occupied by index 13, which was old index 12, so it didn't move; the cell (2,4) is still occupied by the snake.\n> \n> The segment that was at (2,4) is now at (3,4)? No.\n> \n> From above: new index 12 is (3,4), new index 13 is (2,4) from old index 12, so (2,4) is still occupied.\n> \n> The cell (2,4) had food, and after the move, it is still occupied by the snake body, so the food cannot be eaten because the body did not move away; it's still there.\n> \n> For the food to be eatable, the body must move away from that cell, but in this case, when the snake moves, if that particular segment moves, the cell is vacated.\n> \n> For example, if the tail is on the food, and the snake moves without eating, the tail moves away, vacating the cell, but the food is still there, and if the head moves to it later, it can be eaten.\n> \n> But here, life span is 1, so only this turn.\n> \n> For (2,4), it is not the tail; the tail is at (2,6). When the snake moves, the segment at (2,4) will move to a new position only if it's not the last segment, but in the shift, each segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> Specifically, for the cell (2,4), it was occupied by a segment. After move, that segment moves to the position of the segment in front of it, so the cell (2,4) is vacated only if no new segment comes in, but in the shift, the segment leaves, and no one comes if it's not the head moving there.\n> \n> In general, when the snake moves to a new head position, the tail cell is vacated (unless eating), and all other body cells are still occupied, but by different segments.\n> \n> For a body cell not the tail, when the snake moves, the segment that was there moves to a new position, and the cell is vacated for a moment, but immediately the segment behind may move in? No, in the new state, the cell is empty after the move if it was not the tail and not the new head position.\n> \n> In this case, for (2,4), it was occupied by a segment. After the snake moves (head to new position, tail removed), the segment that was at (2,4) is now at a different location, so (2,4) is vacated.\n> \n> Similarly, for (4,2), it was occupied, after move, vacated.\n> \n> But for food to be eaten, the head must move onto it.\n> \n> Since life span is 1, only on this turn can it be eaten.\n> \n> But at the current turn, before move, the food is under body, so head cannot move to it because it's occupied.\n> \n> The rule: \"can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> This happens during the move: when the snake moves, the body moves away from the cell, vacating it, and if the head moves to that cell in the same move, it can eat the food.\n> \n> But in terms of the game turn, during the move action, if the head moves to a cell that was occupied by food and is now vacated, it can eat it.\n> \n> Let's read the rule carefully: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> This implies that during the move, when the body moves away, the cell is free, and head can move to it.\n> \n> For example, at turn 46, before move, food at (2,4) is under body. When I choose to move the head, if I move to (2,4), but (2,4) is currently occupied, so I cannot move there because it's occupied.\n> \n> That's the issue: at the time of choosing the move, the cell (2,4) is occupied, so moving to it would cause collision.\n> \n> Similarly for other cells.\n> \n> So, for food under body, it cannot be eaten on the same turn because the cell is occupied, so head cannot move to it.\n> \n> Only when the food is on a free cell or under the tail, when the tail moves away, it becomes free, but for that, the head must move to it immediately.\n> \n> But if it's not the tail, the cell becomes free after the move, but the head is moving to a different cell, so it doesn't move to that cell.\n> \n> For the head to move to the food cell, it must be adjacent and free at decision time.\n> \n> In this case, for (2,4), it is not adjacent to head; head at (5,3), (2,4) is not adjacent.\n> \n> Adjacent means sharing a side, so (5,3) to (2,4) is not adjacent; distance is larger.\n> \n> So for food at (2,4), it is not accessible this turn because it's occupied and not adjacent to head.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (4,2): position (4,2) is occupied by snake body index 8, and it is not adjacent to head at (5,3). Adjacent cells to (5,3) are (5,4), (5,2), (4,3), (6,3).\n> \n> (4,2) is not adjacent; it's diagonal or something. (5,3) to (4,2) is not adjacent; adjacent are up, down, left, right.\n> \n> So (4,2) is not a possible move from (5,3).\n> \n> Similarly, food at (2,3): (2,3) is not occupied? Snake positions: no (2,3), so it might be free.\n> \n> Food at (2,3): value 4, life span 1.\n> \n> Is (2,3) free? Not in snake positions, not wall, so yes.\n> \n> But is it adjacent to head? Head at (5,3), (2,3) is at x=2, y=3, head at x=5,y=3, so same row, but not adjacent; cells in between.\n> \n> So not a possible move this turn.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (3,6): (3,6), not in snake positions, not wall, but head at (5,3), not adjacent.\n> \n> So none of the food is adjacent to the head at (5,3). The only possible moves are to (5,4), (5,2), (4,3), (6,3), but (5,2) and (4,3) and (6,3) are occupied by body, and (6,3) is also reverse not allowed.\n> \n> So only possible move is to (5,4), which is safe, as we said.\n> \n> But if I move to (5,4), no food eaten, all food disappears after this turn, so I lose all food opportunities.\n> \n> But that can't be right; perhaps I missed something.\n> \n> Food at (4,2) is under body, but not adjacent.\n> \n> Another thing: \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because of collision.\n> \n> But here, tail is at (2,6), head at (5,3), not adjacent.\n> \n> So for turn 46, only possible action is to move up to (5,4), and no food eaten.\n> \n> Then all food disappears.\n> \n> After that, I need to think ahead for survival and future food, but there is no food listed for future turns?

Similarly, (4,2) life span 6, disappears after turn 52, and (3,6) life span 9, disappears after turn 55.\n> \n> Current turn is 47, so:\n> \n> - (2,3): must be eaten by turn 50 (t47,48,49,50; life span decreases each turn, so after 4 turns from now, it's gone. Life span 4 means it has 4 turns left including current, so it will be gone after turn 50. Turn 47: life span 4, turn 48: life span 3, turn 49: life span 2, turn 50: life span 1, then after turn 50, it disappears? Life span decreases every turn, and disappears when life span reaches 0.\n> \n> The rule says: \"disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So for food at (2,3) with life span 4 at turn 47:\n> \n> - Turn 47: life span 4\n> \n> - Turn 48: life span 3\n> \n> - Turn 49: life span 2\n> \n> - Turn 50: life span 1\n> \n> - Turn 51: life span 0, disappears. So it can be eaten up to turn 50, since on turn 50 it's still there with life span 1, and eating happens when head moves onto it during a turn.\n> \n> Similarly for others.\n> \n> But for planning, I need to think about when to eat them.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan an action sequence for at least 5 turns ahead, since it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\".\n> \n> Current turn t1=47.\n> \n> I need to output actions for turn 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, and possibly more if needed, but at least 5 turns.\n> \n> The answer format says \"Action Sequence (in order)\" for multiple turns, but it doesn't specify how many, but since it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I should plan for 5 or 6 turns.\n> \n> Also, prioritize long-term survival over immediate rewards.\n> \n> First, let's map the grid to visualize.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n> \n> Walls: borders, so cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls.

(5,5) is x=5,y=5, both between 1 and 6, so not border. Internal obstacle only (1,6), so (5,5) is empty? But snake body? Snake positions: head (5,4), body (5,3), etc. (5,5) is not in positions, so should be free.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,4): x=4,y=4, not border, not (1,6), and not in snake positions? Positions: (3,4) is segment 12, (4,3) is segment 10, (5,4) head, so (4,4) not listed, so free.\n> \n> (6,4): x=6,y=4, x=6 is border? Walls: x=0 or x=7 are borders, x=6 is not 0 or 7, y=4 not 0 or 7, so not wall. Internal obstacle (1,6), so (6,4) should be free. Snake positions: (6,3) is segment 2, (6,2) segment 3, but not (6,4), so free.\n> \n> But (6,4) might be safe, but let's see the grid.\n> \n> x=6 is not border; borders are x=0 and x=7, so x=1 to 6 are playable, similarly y=1 to 6.\n> \n> x=0 and x=7 are walls, so cells with x=0 or x=7 are walls.

So the food is still covered.\n> \n> To free (4,2), I need the snake to move so that no segment is on (4,2).\n> \n> Since the snake is long, (4,2) might be occupied for several moves until the body moves past it.\n> \n> But the food has life span, so I need to time it.\n> \n> Similarly, for (2,3), it's free now, but I need to go there.\n> \n> Also, there's a danger: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> Tail is at (2,5), and food at (2,3) is not on tail, so no issue yet.\n> \n> But if I eat (2,3), the snake grows, so tail doesn't move, but since I eat, length increases, so when I eat, the tail stays in place for that turn, then next turn it moves.\n> \n> Rule: when you eat food, the snake grows, so after moving, the tail doesn't move; instead, a new segment is added at the tail position, so the tail stays, and snake length increases by one.\n> \n> But for collision, when you eat, head moves to food cell, and since it's positive food, length increases, so the tail doesn't move; it remains, and the new segment is added there.\n> \n> But for body collision, if head moves to a cell occupied by body, it dies, but since the body moves, only if it's occupied after the move.\n> \n> Back to planning.\n> \n> I should aim to eat (2,3) soon since it has short life.\n> \n> Current turn 47, it must be eaten by turn 50.\n> \n> Head at (5,4), (2,3) is at left-down.\n> \n> Path: from (5,4) to (2,3), need to go left and down.\n> \n> But down is not allowed immediately since direction is U, cannot go D.\n> \n> So I need to change direction.\n> \n> Possible moves: L to (4,4), or U to (5,5), or R to (6,4).\n> \n> (4,4) is closer to (2,3).\n> \n> From (4,4), I can go L to (3,4), but (3,4) is currently segment 12, but after move, it will change.\n> \n> Let's think step by step.\n> \n> First, for turn 47, I need to choose an action.\n> \n> If I go L to (4,4), that seems good to go left.\n> \n> Then from there, I can go L to (3,4) or D to (4,3) or U to (4,5), etc.\n> \n> (3,4) is currently occupied, but after I move to (4,4), the snake shifts.\n> \n> After moving head to (4,4):\n> \n> - New head: (4,4)\n> \n> - Segment 1: to (5,4) old head\n> \n> - Segment 2: to (5,3) old seg1\n> \n> - Segment 3: to (6,3) old seg2\n> \n> - And so on, similar to before.\n> \n> Specifically, segment 12 was at (3,4), but after move, segment 13 moves to (2,4) old seg13?

Occupied by the snake's body.\n  - (3,6): value +1, life span 8 (disappears after turn 55).

So the snake has 15 segments. Head direction is Up, which means it was moving towards increasing y.\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - At (2,3) with value 1 and life span 3. Since life span decreases every turn, including current, it will disappear after 3 turns, so by turn 51 it should be gone if not eaten.\n> \n> - At (4,2) with value 1 and life span 5.

It's turn 49, and I'm playing as the snake AI. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and one internal obstacle at (1,6). So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), with walls on the edges.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (5,6), then body segments: (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4). That's 15 segments, so the snake length is 15.\n> \n> Head direction is Up, which means it's moving towards increasing y, so from (5,5) to (5,6) was up.\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (2,3) with value 1, life span 2 (so it disappears after 2 turns, including current turn? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 49, life span 2 means it will be gone after turn 50? Let me clarify.\n> \n> Life span: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So for food at (2,3) with life span 2 at turn 49, it will disappear after turn 50. So it can be eaten on turn 49 or 50.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,2) value 1, life span 4: disappears after turn 52.\n> \n> (3,6) value 1, life span 7: disappears after turn 55.\n> \n> (6,4) value 1, life span 10: disappears after turn 58.\n> \n> All food has value 1, so all are positive food? The value is given as 1 for all, and it says \"positive food\" or \"negative food\" based on value. Here all are value 1, so all positive, no negative food in this state.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan actions for at least 5 turns ahead. Think 5+ turns ahead, prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> Current head position: (5,6), direction Up.\n> \n> Possible moves: Up, Down, Left, Right. But cannot reverse instantly. Since head direction is Up, reverse would be Down, so I cannot move Down on the next turn. So possible moves: Up, Left, Right. Down is invalid because of no instant reverse.\n> \n> From (5,6), moving:\n> \n> - Up: (5,7) but y=7 is a wall, so that's invalid. Wall collision.\n> \n> - Down: (5,5) but that's the body segment, and also, it's the reverse direction, which is not allowed anyway. (5,5) is the second segment, so moving down would hit the body immediately, and also reverse is disallowed.\n> \n> - Left: (4,6)\n> \n> - Right: (6,6)\n> \n> But I need to check if these are safe. Also, walls: x=0 and x=7 are walls, so (4,6) and (6,6) are within bounds since x from 1 to 6? Border cells: x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x=1 to x=6 are free, similarly y=0 and y=7 walls, y=1 to 6 free? y=0 and y=7 are walls, so for y, 1 to 6 are free, but (5,6) has y=6, which is not y=7, so (5,7) is y=7, wall. Similarly, (4,6) y=6, not wall, x=4 between 1 and 6.

Let's see: snake positions include (4,2)?

Food at (4,2), and snake has a segment at (4,2), so yes, it's covered. To eat it, the snake must move so that the body moves away from (4,2), then head moves to it.\n> \n> Similarly, other food points.\n> \n> (2,3) is not occupied by snake, I think. Snake positions: (5,3), (6,3), etc., not (2,3), so it's free.\n> \n> (3,6) is not occupied, (6,4) not occupied.\n> \n> (4,2) is occupied by body.\n> \n> Now, for turn 49, I need to choose action: Left to (4,6) or Right to (6,6).\n> \n> I should consider the food and survival.\n> \n> First, let's think about eating (3,6) food at (3,6), which is close to head. (5,6) to (3,6) is two cells left.\n> \n> But I can't go directly, need to move step by step.\n> \n> Also, (3,6) has life span 7, so plenty of time.\n> \n> (2,3) has only life span 2, so it must be eaten soon or lost.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,2) is under body, need to free it.\n> \n> But (4,2) life span 4, so I have until turn 52.\n> \n> Now, tail position: snake tail is the last segment, (3,4) in the list. Positions are head first, so tail is (3,4).\n> \n> When the snake moves, the tail moves, so after moving, the tail will be at the second last position or something.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, and if no food eaten, tail moves away, so the cell that was tail is vacated.\n> \n> If food eaten, tail doesn't move, so snake grows.\n> \n> In this case, for food under body, like (4,2), which is currently occupied, when the snake moves, if that segment moves away, it becomes free, then head can move to it later to eat.\n> \n> But for (4,2), it's a body segment, not the head.\n> \n> Now, let's list the snake segments in order:\n> \n> Index 0: head (5,6)\n> \n> 1: (5,5)\n> \n> 2: (5,4)\n> \n> 3: (5,3)\n> \n> 4: (6,3)\n> \n> 5: (6,2)\n> \n> 6: (5,2)\n> \n> 7: (5,1)\n> \n> 8: (4,1)\n> \n> 9: (3,1)\n> \n> 10: (3,2)\n> \n> 11: (4,2)  // food here\n> \n> 12: (4,3)\n> \n> 13: (3,3)\n> \n> 14: (3,4)  // tail\n> \n> So (4,2) is segment 11.\n> \n> When the snake moves, each segment moves to the position of the previous segment, except head moves to new position.\n> \n> So to free (4,2), the snake needs to move such that segment 11 moves away from (4,2). But segment 11 is currently at (4,2), and it will move to where segment 10 was, but segment 10 is (3,2), so when snake moves, segment 11 moves to (3,2), and (4,2) is vacated, but only if no food eaten, so tail moves.\n> \n> But if in that move, the head eats food, then tail doesn't move, so segments shift but (4,2) might not be vacated immediately.\n> \n> Let's clarify the movement.\n> \n> At each turn:\n> \n> - Head moves to a new cell (adjacent, not wall, not body except tail).\n> \n> - If the new cell has food, then snake grows, so the tail does not move, and the food is eaten.\n> \n> - If no food, tail moves out of its current position (so that cell is vacated).\n> \n> For a cell with food under the body: it can be eaten only if the body moves away (so the cell is vacated), and then later, head moves to it when it's free.\n> \n> In the case of (4,2), it is currently occupied by a body segment. When the snake moves without eating, the tail moves, so the positions shift.\n> \n> For example, if on turn 49, I move the head to a new position with no food, then:\n> \n> - Head moves to new pos, say (4,6)\n> \n> - Each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> So segment 1 (was (5,5)) moves to head old pos (5,6)\n> \n> Segment 2 (was (5,4)) moves to (5,5)\n> \n> ...\n> \n> Segment 10 (was (3,2)) moves to where?

No: when head moves to (5,6), at the same time, B1 moves to (4,6). So the cell (5,6) is entered by head, and B1 leaves it to go to (4,6).

There's an internal obstacle at (1,6).\n> \n> The snake positions are given as a list: head is at (3,6), and the body follows. The snake has 16 segments. Head direction is left (L), meaning it's moving left.\n> \n> Food information:\n> - Food at (4,2) with value 1 and life span 3. That means it will disappear after 3 turns, including the current turn, so it might vanish soon.\n> - Food at (6,4) with value 1 and life span 8, so it has more time.\n> \n> I need to think at least 5 turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks. Prioritize long-term survival over immediate rewards.\n> \n> Key rules:\n> - Positive food: +1 score, snake grows by 1 segment.\n> - Negative food: -1 score, no growth, but there's no negative food mentioned here. Both foods have value 1, so they're positive.\n> - Food can be under the snake's body, but can only be eaten when the body moves away and head moves onto it. In this case, look at the food positions.\n> \n> Food at (4,2): Let's see where (4,2) is relative to the snake. Snake positions: [(3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3)]\n> \n> (4,2) is in the snake positions! It's the 14th segment, counting from head. Head is index 0: (3,6), then (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2) -- (5,2) is index 8? Let's list with indices:\n> \n> Index: 0: (3,6) head\n> \n> 1: (4,6)\n> \n> 2: (5,6)\n> \n> 3: (5,5)\n> \n> 4: (5,4)\n> \n> 5: (5,3)\n> \n> 6: (6,3)\n> \n> 7: (6,2)\n> \n> 8: (5,2)\n> \n> 9: (5,1)\n> \n> 10: (4,1)\n> \n> 11: (3,1)\n> \n> 12: (3,2)\n> \n> 13: (4,2)  <-- food is here? Position (4,2) is at index 13? Snake positions: ... (3,1) index 11, (3,2) index 12, (4,2) index 13, then (4,3) index 14, (3,3) index 15.\n> \n> Food is at (4,2), which is occupied by the snake's body segment at index 13. So yes, food is under the snake's body.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (6,4) is not in the snake positions; let's check: snake has (5,4) at index 4, (6,3) at index 6, but no (6,4), so it's free.\n> \n> Now, for the food at (4,2), since it's under the body, I can only eat it if the body moves away and then the head moves onto it. That means I need to move so that the segment at (4,2) moves, and later head comes to (4,2).\n> \n> But the life span is 3, including current turn, so it might disappear soon. Turn 51: life span 3, so after turn 51, it has 2 turns left? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 51, life span 3 means it will disappear after 3 turns, i.e., at the start of turn 54 or something. Let's clarify.\n> \n> The rule says: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So for food at (4,2) with life_span=3 at turn 51:\n> \n> - Turn 51: countdown 3\n> \n> - Turn 52: countdown 2\n> \n> - Turn 53: countdown 1\n> \n> - Turn 54: countdown 0, disappears before or at turn 54? I think it disappears when countdown reaches 0, so after turn 53, it might be gone for turn 54. Typically, we say it disappears after N turns, meaning it's there for N turns starting from now.\n> \n> Assume that at turn t, with life_span L, it will be present on turns t, t+1, ..., t+L-1, and disappears at turn t+L.\n> \n> So for (4,2): at turn 51, life_span=3, so present on turns 51, 52, 53. Disappears at turn 54.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,4): life_span=8, present on turns 51 to 58.\n> \n> Now, head is at (3,6), direction left. So from (3,6), moving left would be to (2,6), but let's see the grid.\n> \n> First, possible moves from head position (3,6):\n> \n> - Up: (3,7) but y=7 is border wall, so invalid? Walls: border cells x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7. So (3,7) has y=7, which is wall, so cannot move there.\n> \n> - Down: (3,5)\n> \n> - Left: (2,6)\n> \n> - Right: (4,6) but (4,6) is occupied by the snake body at index 1, so moving there would cause collision, death.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (3,6), next is (4,6), so (4,6) is the first body segment. Moving right to (4,6) would make head hit the body, immediate death. Similarly, moving into any body segment except possibly the tail is deadly.\n> \n> But the tail: tail is at (3,3), index 15.\n> \n> Rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, moving to tail is safe only if it's the tail and it moves away.\n> \n> In this case, from (3,6), possible moves:\n> \n> - Up: (3,7) - y=7 is wall, invalid.\n> \n> - Down: (3,5) - is this free? Snake positions: (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), etc. (3,5) not in positions, so should be free, but let's confirm.\n> \n> Positions: (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3)\n> \n> So (3,5) not listed, so empty.\n> \n> - Left: (2,6) - not in snake positions, and x=2, y=6, should be within bounds? x=0 to 7, y=0 to 7, (2,6) is not border or obstacle. Obstacles: internal only (1,6), so (2,6) should be free.\n> \n> - Right: (4,6) - occupied by body segment, so if move there, head collides with body, death.\n> \n> So valid moves: Down to (3,5) or Left to (2,6).\n> \n> Current direction is Left, so moving Left is fine, moving Down is also possible since it's not opposite? No instant reverse: cannot move opposite to current direction.\n> \n> Current direction is L (left), so opposite is R (right), which is invalid anyway. Down is perpendicular, not opposite, so should be allowed.\n> \n> Opposite directions: U and D are opposites, L and R are opposites. Perpendicular moves are allowed.\n> \n> So from Left, I can go U, D, L, but U is wall, so only D or L.\n> \n> Actions: L or D.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5 turns ahead.\n> \n> First, let's consider the food at (4,2) which is under the body. To eat it, I need the body to move away from (4,2), and then head to move there.\n> \n> Currently, (4,2) is occupied by segment at index 13. When the snake moves, the tail moves forward, but since we eat food, the tail doesn't move if we eat, but for now, no food eaten, so each move, tail moves.\n> \n> But (4,2) is not the tail; tail is (3,3).\n> \n> So as the snake moves, segments shift, so (4,2) will be occupied by different segments over time.\n> \n> Specifically, when the snake moves, the head moves to a new position, and each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment. So the segment that was at (4,2) will move to where index 12 was, which is (3,2), and so on.\n> \n> Let's simulate the movement.\n> \n> Also, food at (4,2) can be eaten only when it's free and head moves there.\n> \n> Since it's currently occupied, I need to move so that in some future turn, (4,2) is empty, and I can move head there.\n> \n> But life span is short, only until turn 53.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (6,4) is free, but I need to go there.\n> \n> First, let's think about survival and path.\n> \n> The grid is 8x8, walls at borders and internal obstacle at (1,6).\n> \n> Snake is long, 16 segments, so space might be tight.\n> \n> Available cells: total grid 8x8=64 cells, walls: borders are all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, but borders are lines, so cells where x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls, so corners are walls too.\n> \n> Number of wall cells: top and bottom rows: y=0 and y=7, each has 8 cells, but x from 0 to 7, so 16 cells.\n> \n> Left and right columns: x=0 and x=7, but y from 1 to 6 to avoid double-counting corners? Better to count:\n> \n> - Cells with x=0: y=0 to 7, 8 cells\n> \n> - x=7: y=0 to 7, 8 cells\n> \n> - y=0: x=0 to 7, but x=0 and x=7 already counted, so only x=1 to 6, 6 cells\n> \n> - y=7: similarly, x=1 to 6, 6 cells\n> \n> Plus internal obstacle (1,6), so one more.\n> \n> So total wall cells: 8 (x=0) + 8 (x=7) + 6 (y=0, x1-6) + 6 (y=7, x1-6) + 1 (1,6) = 8+8=16, +6=22, +6=28, +1=29 wall cells.\n> \n> Then free cells: 64 - 29 = 35, but snake occupies 16 cells, so free space: 35 - 16 = 19 cells? But snake is on some cells, including the one with food under it.\n> \n> (4,2) has food but is occupied, so it's not free for movement until snake moves away.\n> \n> At turn 51, cells occupied by snake: 16 cells, including (4,2) with food.\n> \n> Free cells: total cells minus walls minus snake-occupied cells.\n> \n> Total cells: 64\n> \n> Wall cells: as above, 29\n> \n> But walls are separate; cells that are walls cannot be occupied.\n> \n> So available for snake: cells not walls, not occupied by snake body except tail can be moved to under conditions.\n> \n> But for movement, a cell is free if not wall and not occupied by snake body (except tail, but carefully).\n> \n> In terms of grid state:\n> \n> - Walls: cannot move to\n> \n> - Snake body except tail: cannot move to, collision\n> \n> - Tail: can move to, since tail moves away\n> \n> - Empty cells: can move to\n> \n> - Food cells: same, but if empty and food, can eat.\n> \n> In this case, (4,2) is occupied by body, not tail, so cannot move there now.\n> \n> (6,4) is empty, no wall, so can move there if possible.\n> \n> Now, back to moves from (3,6): can go to (3,5) or (2,6).\n> \n> I need to think 5 turns ahead.\n> \n> Also, the tail is at (3,3), and there might be a danger with food.\n> \n> But no food at tail now.\n> \n> First, let's list possible action sequences for 5 turns, but that might be too many. I need to evaluate options.\n> \n> Since head direction is L, and I can go L or D.\n> \n> Option 1: Move Left to (2,6)\n> \n> Then from (2,6), possible moves: U, D, L, R.\n> \n> U: (2,7) y=7 wall, invalid\n> \n> D: (2,5) should be free? Check snake positions: no (2,5), walls: x=2 not border, y=5 not border, internal obstacle (1,6) not (2,5), so free.\n> \n> L: (1,6) but (1,6) is internal obstacle, wall, so invalid.\n> \n> R: (3,6) but (3,6) is where head was, now body segment? After moving left to (2,6), the snake positions: head to (2,6), then body: (3,6) becomes segment 1, (4,6) segment 2, etc. So (3,6) is occupied by body, so moving right to (3,6) would be collision.\n> \n> So from (2,6), possible moves: D to (2,5) or ... U invalid, L invalid, R invalid? Only D?\n> \n> U: (2,7) wall, invalid.\n> \n> D: (2,5) free.\n> \n> L: (1,6) wall, invalid.\n> \n> R: (3,6) occupied by body (since after move, (3,6) is segment 1), so cannot move there.\n> \n> So only possible move down to (2,5).\n> \n> Then from (2,5), and so on. This seems restrictive.\n> \n> Option 2: Move Down to (3,5)\n> \n> From (3,5), possible moves: U, D, L, R.\n> \n> U: (3,6) - after moving down, (3,6) is now segment 1, occupied, so cannot move up.\n> \n> D: (3,4) - is it free? Snake positions: (5,4) index 4, (5,3) index 5, etc. No (3,4), so free.\n> \n> L: (2,5) - free, as above.\n> \n> R: (4,5) - is it free? Snake has (4,6) index 1, but after move, positions: head at (3,5), then (3,6), (4,6), etc. (4,5) not in positions, so should be free.\n> \n> But let's confirm: current positions after move to (3,5): head (3,5), body: (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3)\n> \n> (4,5) not listed, so free.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,5) free, (3,4) free.\n> \n> So from (3,5), possible moves: D to (3,4), L to (2,5), or R to (4,5).

However, the food at (4,2) cannot be eaten immediately because it's under the tail. \n   - To eat it, the head would need to move to (4,2) on turn 53, but this is not feasible because the head cannot reach (4,2) from (3,4) in one move (it's not adjacent diagonally).\n   - This move does not lead to immediate food and may limit future options.\n\n2. **Move L to (2,5)**:\n   - Moves the snake left, away from the food at (6,4).\n   - This move does not seem to lead towards any food and may not be optimal for maximizing score.\n\n3. **Move R to (4,5)**:\n   - Moves the snake closer to the food at (6,4).\n   - From (4,5), the next move could be to (5,5) or (4,4), eventually leading towards (6,4).\n   - This is the most promising move to eventually reach the food at (6,4), which has a longer life_span and is currently free.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe best immediate action is to move **right (R)** to (4,5), as it positions the snake to potentially reach the food at (6,4) in future turns.\n\n\\boxed{R}",

It's turn 52, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think? Let me confirm the grid size.\n> \n> Walls: Border cells x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7. So the grid is 8x8, but cells from (1,1) to (6,6) are playable since x and y from 1 to 6 inclusive? x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x-coordinates from 1 to 6 are valid, similarly y from 1 to 6. Let's see:\n> \n> - x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x can be 1,2,3,4,5,6.\n> \n> - y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y can be 1,2,3,4,5,6.\n> \n> Also, there's an internal obstacle at (1,6).\n> \n> Internal obstacles: [(1,6)]\n> \n> So (1,6) is blocked.\n> \n> Now, snake positions: head is at (3,5), and direction is D (down). The positions are:\n> \n> [(3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3)]\n> \n> Let me list them in order:\n> \n> - Head: (3,5)\n> \n> - Then (3,6) — that's up from head? Head is (3,5), direction down, but next segment is (3,6), which is north, so y=6 is higher, so up. Direction is given as D, but the snake is moving down, I think. Head direction is D, meaning it just moved down to (3,5)? Let's see the positions.\n> \n> Positions: [(3,5), (3,6), ...] so head at (3,5), and the next segment is (3,6), which is directly above since y=6 > y=5, so north. But direction is given as \"Snake Head Direction: D\", which might mean the direction it is facing or the last move direction. I think it's the last move direction, meaning it moved down to (3,5) from previous position.\n> \n> From the list, positions are head first: (3,5) is head, then body: (3,6), then (4,6), etc. So at turn 52, head is at (3,5), and it just moved to there, so previous head was at (3,6) or something? Let's trace.\n> \n> The positions list: index 0: head (3,5), index 1: (3,6), which is the segment behind the head. Since head moved down to (3,5), it must have come from (3,4) or something? I'm confused.\n> \n> Perhaps the positions are listed from head to tail. So head at (3,5), then the next segment is the one it was connected to, which is (3,6). But (3,6) has higher y, so if head is at (3,5) and direction is D (down), that means it moved down to (3,5), so from where? If it moved down to (3,5), previous position should have lower y, like (3,4). But the list shows (3,6) as the second segment, which has higher y.\n> \n> This seems inconsistent. Let me plot the positions.\n> \n> List all positions in order:\n> \n> 1. Head: (3,5)\n> \n> 2. (3,6) — that's north of head? (3,6) has y=6, head y=5, so if head is at (3,5) and direction is D, meaning it moved down, so it came from (3,6) to (3,5)? But (3,6) is listed as the second segment, so it must be the neck.\n> \n> Typically in snake, the head moves, and the body follows. So if head is at (3,5) and direction is D, that means at turn 52, it moved down to (3,5), so at turn 51, head was at (3,4), for example. But the positions list shows the current segments.\n> \n> The positions are the current state: head at (3,5), then the body segments in order. So segment 1 is (3,6), which is adjacent to head at (3,5). Since head is at (3,5) and segment 1 is (3,6), which is directly above (y=6), so the snake has a bend or something.\n> \n> Direction is given as \"Snake Head Direction: D\", which I believe is the direction the head is facing or the last move direction. Since it says \"direction\", and it's D, down.\n> \n> But visually, from (3,6) to (3,5) is south, down, so last move was from (3,6) to (3,5), so direction D is consistent. Then from (3,6) to (4,6) is east, and so on.\n> \n> So the snake body: from head (3,5) down to... positions: (3,5) head, then (3,6) neck, then (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), and that's the tail, I assume.\n> \n> Length: 16 segments?

Format is ( (x,y), value, life_span ), but here it's written as (4,2,2,1), so I think it's (x,y, life_span, value)? Let's see the input: \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value: - (4, 2, 2, 1)\" — it says \"Life Span and Value\", so probably (x,y, life_span, value).\n> \n> Similarly, - (6,4,7,1) and - (3,1,10,1)\n> \n> So:\n> \n> - Food at (4,2): life_span 2, value +1 (since all have value 1, so all positive food?

Let's see: life_span N, disappears after N turns, countdown decreases each turn including current. So at turn t, if life_span is L, it will be gone after t + L - 1? For example, life_span 2 at turn 52: after turn 52, it has one turn left; after turn 53, it disappears. So it can be eaten on turn 52 or 53.\n> \n> Similarly, life_span 7 at turn 52: can be eaten from turn 52 to 58.\n> \n> Life_span 10: turns 52 to 61.\n> \n> Now, the snake head is at (3,5), direction down.\n> \n> Available moves: since direction is down, I can move down, left, or right?

Typically in grids, y=0 at bottom or top? The walls: y=0 and y=7 are walls, and snake positions: for example, (5,1) is near bottom, since y=1 is above y=0 wall? Let's clarify the coordinate system.\n> \n> Walls: y=0 and y=7 are walls. Snake positions: (5,1) is given, and (5,1) has y=1, which is just above y=0 wall, so y=1 is the bottom row, y=6 is the top row? Since y=7 is wall.\n> \n> Similarly, x=0 left wall, x=7 right wall, so x=1 left, x=6 right.\n> \n> So grid: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, with (1,1) bottom-left? y=1 bottom, y=6 top? Not specified, but since y=0 is wall below, y=1 is the lowest row, so y increases upwards? Let's see positions.\n> \n> For example, head at (3,5), and (3,6) is above it, since y=6 > y=5, so y increases as we go up. Similarly, (5,1) is low y, so bottom.\n> \n> So coordinate system: (x,y) with x from 1 to 6 (left to right), y from 1 to 6 (bottom to top? y=1 bottom, y=6 top? y=0 is wall below, so y=1 is the bottom row, meaning low y is bottom, high y is top. So y increases upwards.\n> \n> In movement: U is (x,y+1) — so up, increasing y.\n> \n> D is (x,y-1) — down, decreasing y.\n> \n> L is (x-1,y) — left, decreasing x.\n> \n> R is (x+1,y) — right, increasing x.\n> \n> From head (3,5):\n> \n> Possible moves:\n> \n> - D: (3,4) — down to y=4\n> \n> - L: (2,5) — left to x=2\n> \n> - R: (4,5) — right to x=4\n> \n> Cannot move U, opposite of current direction D.\n> \n> Now, I need to check for collisions or walls.\n> \n> First, walls: border walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so moving to x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6 is safe from walls, except internal obstacle at (1,6).\n> \n> (1,6) is occupied by obstacle, so cannot move there.\n> \n> Now for each move:\n> \n> - D to (3,4): is (3,4) occupied by snake body?

Similarly, (3,1) has food under body.\n> \n> To eat (4,2) food, since life_span 2, it must be eaten soon. On turn 52, it's occupied, so cannot eat. On turn 53, if the snake moves so that (4,2) is free, and head moves to it.\n> \n> But (4,2) is currently occupied by the 14th segment (index 14). When the snake moves, each segment moves to the next position, so the tail moves away, and new head position.\n> \n> When snake moves, the head moves to a new cell, and each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment in front, so the tail segment is left, and a new cell is occupied at head.\n> \n> For food under body, it can be eaten only if that body segment moves away (i.e., when the snake moves, that cell is vacated), and then head moves to it on a subsequent turn.\n> \n> For (4,2), it is currently occupied. When the snake moves on turn 52, if the segment at (4,2) moves to the next position, but it depends on the movement.\n> \n> The segment at (4,2) will move to where the segment in front was going. Segment in front of (4,2) is (3,2) at index 13, which is connected to (4,2).\n> \n> From positions: index 13: (3,2), index 14: (4,2), so from (3,2) to (4,2) is right.\n> \n> When the snake moves, the head moves to a new position, say to (3,4) for example if we move down.\n> \n> Then the new positions: head to (3,4), then the old head (3,5) becomes neck, then (3,6), then (4,6), and so on, up to tail.\n> \n> Specifically, the segment that was at index i moves to the position of index i-1 after move.\n> \n> After move, new head at new position, then new body[0] = old head position, body[1] = old body[0], etc., down to tail.\n> \n> For cell (4,2), it is currently occupied by the segment at index 14. After a move, that segment will move to the position that is currently index 13, which is (3,2).\n> \n> So if we move on turn 52, the snake moves, the segment that was at (4,2) will move to (3,2), so (4,2) is vacated, unless (3,2) is occupied, but (3,2) is a different cell.\n> \n> After move, the cell (4,2) is no longer occupied, because the segment moved to (3,2).\n> \n> Similarly, the tail at (4,3) moves to where the previous segment was, but since it's tail, it leaves the cell.\n> \n> So when the snake moves, all cells except the new head position are shifted, so the tail cell is vacated, and body cells move, so any cell that was occupied only by moving segments will be vacated if not the new position.\n> \n> Specifically for (4,2): after any move on turn 52, since it is not the head and not the new head position, it will be vacated because the segment moves to a different cell.\n> \n> Similarly for (3,1).\n> \n> So after turn 52 move, (4,2) will be free, and food is there with life_span 2, but after turn 52, if not eaten, life_span decreases to 1, so it can be eaten on turn 53.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,1) will be free after move, but life_span 10, so plenty of time.\n> \n> Now for (4,2) food, it can be eaten on turn 53 if head moves to it, since it will be free after turn 52 move.\n> \n> But on turn 52, we move, and after move, (4,2) is free, but head is not there; head is at new position.\n> \n> Then on turn 53, if head moves to (4,2), it can eat it.\n> \n> Life_span: at turn 52, life_span=2, so it exists on turn 52 and 53.

On turn 53, to move to (4,2), head must be at an adjacent cell on turn 52, but all adjacent cells are occupied, so head cannot be there.

Let's see:\n> \n> - x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x can be 1,2,3,4,5,6.\n> \n> - y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y can be 1,2,3,4,5,6.\n> \n> Also, there's an internal obstacle at (1,6).\n> \n> Internal obstacles: [(1,6)]\n> \n> So (1,6) is blocked.\n> \n> Now, snake positions: head is at (3,5), and direction is D (down). The positions are:\n> \n> [(3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3)]\n> \n> Let me list them in order:\n> \n> - Head: (3,5)\n> \n> - Then (3,6) — that's up from head? Head is (3,5), direction down, but next segment is (3,6), which is north, so y=6 is higher, so up. Direction is given as D, but the snake is moving down, I think. Head direction is D, meaning it just moved down to (3,5)? Let's see the positions.\n> \n> Positions: [(3,5), (3,6), ...] so head at (3,5), and the next segment is (3,6), which is directly above since y=6 > y=5, so north. But direction is given as \"Snake Head Direction: D\", which might mean the direction it is facing or the last move direction. I think it's the last move direction, meaning it moved down to (3,5) from previous position.\n> \n> From the list, positions are head first: (3,5) is head, then body: (3,6), then (4,6), etc. So at turn 52, head is at (3,5), and it just moved to there, so previous head was at (3,6) or something? Let's trace.\n> \n> The positions list: index 0: head (3,5), index 1: (3,6), which is the segment behind the head. Since head moved down to (3,5), it must have come from (3,4) or something? I'm confused.\n> \n> Perhaps the positions are listed from head to tail. So head at (3,5), then the next segment is the one it was connected to, which is (3,6). But (3,6) has higher y, so if head is at (3,5) and direction is D (down), that means it moved down to (3,5), so from where? If it moved down to (3,5), previous position should have lower y, like (3,4). But the list shows (3,6) as the second segment, which has higher y.\n> \n> This seems inconsistent. Let me plot the positions.\n> \n> List all positions in order:\n> \n> 1. Head: (3,5)\n> \n> 2. (3,6) — that's north of head? (3,6) has y=6, head y=5, so if head is at (3,5) and direction is D, meaning it moved down, so it came from (3,6) to (3,5)? But (3,6) is listed as the second segment, so it must be the neck.\n> \n> Typically in snake, the head moves, and the body follows. So if head is at (3,5) and direction is D, that means at turn 52, it moved down to (3,5), so at turn 51, head was at (3,4), for example. But the positions list shows the current segments.\n> \n> The positions are the current state: head at (3,5), then the body segments in order. So segment 1 is (3,6), which is adjacent to head at (3,5). Since head is at (3,5) and segment 1 is (3,6), which is directly above (y=6), so the snake has a bend or something.\n> \n> Direction is given as \"Snake Head Direction: D\", which I believe is the direction the head is facing or the last move direction. Since it says \"direction\", and it's D, down.\n> \n> But visually, from (3,6) to (3,5) is south, down, so last move was from (3,6) to (3,5), so direction D is consistent. Then from (3,6) to (4,6) is east, and so on.\n> \n> So the snake body: from head (3,5) down to... positions: (3,5) head, then (3,6) neck, then (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), and that's the tail, I assume.\n> \n> Length: 16 segments? Let's count: positions from index 0 to 15, so 16 cells.\n> \n> Indices: 0: (3,5), 1: (3,6), 2: (4,6), 3: (5,6), 4: (5,5), 5: (5,4), 6: (5,3), 7: (6,3), 8: (6,2), 9: (5,2), 10: (5,1), 11: (4,1), 12: (3,1), 13: (3,2), 14: (4,2), 15: (4,3) — that's 16 positions, so snake length is 16.\n> \n> Tail is at (4,3).\n> \n> Now food positions:\n> \n> - (4,2, 2, 1) — this is (x,y, life_span, value). Format is ( (x,y), value, life_span ), but here it's written as (4,2,2,1), so I think it's (x,y, life_span, value)? Let's see the input: \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value: - (4, 2, 2, 1)\" — it says \"Life Span and Value\", so probably (x,y, life_span, value).\n> \n> Similarly, - (6,4,7,1) and - (3,1,10,1)\n> \n> So:\n> \n> - Food at (4,2): life_span 2, value +1 (since all have value 1, so all positive food? Value 1, and it says value1, value2, all 1, so all are positive food? But it says \"value and life_span\", and value is 1 for all, so all are +1 food, no negative food mentioned. But the core rules include negative food, but here all have value 1, so all positive.\n> \n> Value: for (4,2,2,1), value=1, life_span=2\n> \n> Similarly, (6,4,7,1): value=1, life_span=7\n> \n> (3,1,10,1): value=1, life_span=10\n> \n> All have value 1, so all positive food.\n> \n> Life_span: how many turns left, including current turn, I think. \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so at turn 52, for (4,2) life_span=2, so it disappears after turn 53? Let's see: life_span N, disappears after N turns, countdown decreases each turn including current. So at turn t, if life_span is L, it will be gone after t + L - 1? For example, life_span 2 at turn 52: after turn 52, it has one turn left; after turn 53, it disappears. So it can be eaten on turn 52 or 53.\n> \n> Similarly, life_span 7 at turn 52: can be eaten from turn 52 to 58.\n> \n> Life_span 10: turns 52 to 61.\n> \n> Now, the snake head is at (3,5), direction down.\n> \n> Available moves: since direction is down, I can move down, left, or right? But no instant reverse, so cannot move up (opposite of down).\n> \n> Current direction D, so cannot move U next. Can move D, L, or R.\n> \n> Now, possible moves from (3,5):\n> \n> - Down (D): to (3,4) — y decreases? Coordinates: let's assume y increases up, x increases right? Typically in grids, y=0 at bottom or top? The walls: y=0 and y=7 are walls, and snake positions: for example, (5,1) is near bottom, since y=1 is above y=0 wall? Let's clarify the coordinate system.\n> \n> Walls: y=0 and y=7 are walls. Snake positions: (5,1) is given, and (5,1) has y=1, which is just above y=0 wall, so y=1 is the bottom row, y=6 is the top row? Since y=7 is wall.\n> \n> Similarly, x=0 left wall, x=7 right wall, so x=1 left, x=6 right.\n> \n> So grid: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, with (1,1) bottom-left? y=1 bottom, y=6 top? Not specified, but since y=0 is wall below, y=1 is the lowest row, so y increases upwards? Let's see positions.\n> \n> For example, head at (3,5), and (3,6) is above it, since y=6 > y=5, so y increases as we go up. Similarly, (5,1) is low y, so bottom.\n> \n> So coordinate system: (x,y) with x from 1 to 6 (left to right), y from 1 to 6 (bottom to top? y=1 bottom, y=6 top? y=0 is wall below, so y=1 is the bottom row, meaning low y is bottom, high y is top. So y increases upwards.\n> \n> In movement: U is (x,y+1) — so up, increasing y.\n> \n> D is (x,y-1) — down, decreasing y.\n> \n> L is (x-1,y) — left, decreasing x.\n> \n> R is (x+1,y) — right, increasing x.\n> \n> From head (3,5):\n> \n> Possible moves:\n> \n> - D: (3,4) — down to y=4\n> \n> - L: (2,5) — left to x=2\n> \n> - R: (4,5) — right to x=4\n> \n> Cannot move U, opposite of current direction D.\n> \n> Now, I need to check for collisions or walls.\n> \n> First, walls: border walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so moving to x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6 is safe from walls, except internal obstacle at (1,6).\n> \n> (1,6) is occupied by obstacle, so cannot move there.\n> \n> Now for each move:\n> \n> - D to (3,4): is (3,4) occupied by snake body? Snake positions: let's list all occupied cells.\n> \n> Snake: (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3)\n> \n> So (3,4) is not in this list, so not occupied. Also, not a wall. So safe to move? But need to consider if moving there causes collision later, but for now, the cell is free.\n> \n> - L to (2,5): (2,5) not in snake positions, not wall, so safe.\n> \n> - R to (4,5): (4,5) not in snake positions? Positions: (4,6), (4,3), etc., not (4,5). So free, safe.\n> \n> All three moves are immediately safe.\n> \n> But I need to think ahead 5+ turns, maximize score, avoid risks.\n> \n> Now, food locations:\n> \n> - (4,2) with life_span 2, value +1\n> \n> - (6,4) with life_span 7, value +1\n> \n> - (3,1) with life_span 10, value +1\n> \n> (4,2) is a food cell, but let's see if it's under snake body.\n> \n> Snake positions include (4,2), which is index 14: (4,2) is occupied by the snake body.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,1) is also occupied, index 12: (3,1)\n> \n> And (6,4) is not occupied, free cell.\n> \n> For food under snake body, it can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves onto it later.\n> \n> Specifically, (4,2) has food, but it's currently occupied by snake body at position (4,2), which is part of the snake. Since life_span is 2, it might disappear soon.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,1) has food, occupied by snake at (3,1).\n> \n> (6,4) has food, not occupied.\n> \n> Also, note the tail position: tail is at (4,3), which is adjacent to head? Head at (3,5), tail at (4,3), not adjacent.\n> \n> Adjacent cells to head: (3,4) down, (2,5) left, (4,5) right, and (3,6) up but that's body, not empty.\n> \n> Now, for (4,2) food: it's under the snake, so to eat it, the snake must move so that (4,2) is vacated, then head moves to it.\n> \n> But life_span is only 2, so at turn 52, life_span=2, after this turn, if not eaten, life_span decreases to 1, then after turn 53, it disappears. So it can be eaten only on turn 52 or 53.\n> \n> But on turn 52, (4,2) is occupied, so cannot eat now. Only if the snake moves away and head comes back, but with short life, it might be hard.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,1) has life_span 10, so more time.\n> \n> (6,4) is free, can be eaten if head goes there.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan a sequence of actions for multiple turns, thinking ahead.\n> \n> Since the snake is long, 16 segments, and grid is small, 6x6=36 cells, snake occupies 16, so 20 free cells, but with obstacles, internal (1,6) blocked, so total free cells: 36 - 16 snake - 1 obstacle = 19 free cells? Grid is x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, so 6*6=36 cells.\n> \n> Walls are borders, not cells, so 36 playable cells minus internal obstacle (1,6), so 35 cells minus snake 16, so 19 free cells.\n> \n> But food is placed on some, but not counted in free for movement.\n> \n> Now, to maximize score, I should eat food, but avoid risks.\n> \n> First, let's consider the immediate choices.\n> \n> From (3,5), I can go D, L, or R.\n> \n> If I go D to (3,4), then head at (3,4). From there, I can move to adjacent cells, but need to see body.\n> \n> Similarly for others.\n> \n> But I need to think about getting food.\n> \n> The food at (6,4) is free and has life_span 7, plenty of time.\n> \n> (4,2) is under snake and short life, might not be worth pursuing if risky.\n> \n> (3,1) is under snake, long life, so possible to eat later.\n> \n> Also, there might be a danger with tail: if head adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it kills because tail grows and collides.\n> \n> But here, tail is at (4,3), and it has no food? The food is at (4,2), which is different cell. (4,2) has food, but tail is at (4,3), not the same.\n> \n> So no immediate tail danger.\n> \n> Now, let's sketch the snake shape to understand.\n> \n> List positions:\n> \n> Head: (3,5)\n> \n> Then: (3,6) - up\n> \n> (4,6) - right\n> \n> (5,6) - right\n> \n> (5,5) - down\n> \n> (5,4) - down\n> \n> (5,3) - down\n> \n> (6,3) - right\n> \n> (6,2) - down\n> \n> (5,2) - left\n> \n> (5,1) - down? (5,1) to (5,2) is up? Positions: (6,2) to (5,2) is left, then (5,2) to (5,1) is down? (5,2) to (5,1): y from 2 to 1, decreasing, so down.\n> \n> Then (5,1) to (4,1) - left\n> \n> (4,1) to (3,1) - left\n> \n> (3,1) to (3,2) - up\n> \n> (3,2) to (4,2) - right\n> \n> (4,2) to (4,3) - up\n> \n> Tail at (4,3)\n> \n> The snake has many bends, and the body occupies a lot of space.\n> \n> Food at (4,2): this cell is occupied by the snake body at position (4,2), which is part of the snake, so the food is under the body. Similarly, (3,1) has food under body.\n> \n> To eat (4,2) food, since life_span 2, it must be eaten soon. On turn 52, it's occupied, so cannot eat. On turn 53, if the snake moves so that (4,2) is free, and head moves to it.\n> \n> But (4,2) is currently occupied by the 14th segment (index 14). When the snake moves, each segment moves to the next position, so the tail moves away, and new head position.\n> \n> When snake moves, the head moves to a new cell, and each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment in front, so the tail segment is left, and a new cell is occupied at head.\n> \n> For food under body, it can be eaten only if that body segment moves away (i.e., when the snake moves, that cell is vacated), and then head moves to it on a subsequent turn.\n> \n> For (4,2), it is currently occupied. When the snake moves on turn 52, if the segment at (4,2) moves to the next position, but it depends on the movement.\n> \n> The segment at (4,2) will move to where the segment in front was going. Segment in front of (4,2) is (3,2) at index 13, which is connected to (4,2).\n> \n> From positions: index 13: (3,2), index 14: (4,2), so from (3,2) to (4,2) is right.\n> \n> When the snake moves, the head moves to a new position, say to (3,4) for example if we move down.\n> \n> Then the new positions: head to (3,4), then the old head (3,5) becomes neck, then (3,6), then (4,6), and so on, up to tail.\n> \n> Specifically, the segment that was at index i moves to the position of index i-1 after move.\n> \n> After move, new head at new position, then new body[0] = old head position, body[1] = old body[0], etc., down to tail.\n> \n> For cell (4,2), it is currently occupied by the segment at index 14. After a move, that segment will move to the position that is currently index 13, which is (3,2).\n> \n> So if we move on turn 52, the snake moves, the segment that was at (4,2) will move to (3,2), so (4,2) is vacated, unless (3,2) is occupied, but (3,2) is a different cell.\n> \n> After move, the cell (4,2) is no longer occupied, because the segment moved to (3,2).\n> \n> Similarly, the tail at (4,3) moves to where the previous segment was, but since it's tail, it leaves the cell.\n> \n> So when the snake moves, all cells except the new head position are shifted, so the tail cell is vacated, and body cells move, so any cell that was occupied only by moving segments will be vacated if not the new position.\n> \n> Specifically for (4,2): after any move on turn 52, since it is not the head and not the new head position, it will be vacated because the segment moves to a different cell.\n> \n> Similarly for (3,1).\n> \n> So after turn 52 move, (4,2) will be free, and food is there with life_span 2, but after turn 52, if not eaten, life_span decreases to 1, so it can be eaten on turn 53.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,1) will be free after move, but life_span 10, so plenty of time.\n> \n> Now for (4,2) food, it can be eaten on turn 53 if head moves to it, since it will be free after turn 52 move.\n> \n> But on turn 52, we move, and after move, (4,2) is free, but head is not there; head is at new position.\n> \n> Then on turn 53, if head moves to (4,2), it can eat it.\n> \n> Life_span: at turn 52, life_span=2, so it exists on turn 52 and 53. After turn 53, it disappears.\n> \n> So it can be eaten on turn 52 or 53, but on turn 52 it was occupied, so only possible on turn 53 if head moves to (4,2) and it is free.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,1) can be eaten later.\n> \n> Now, back to current move.\n> \n> From head (3,5), options: D, L, R.\n> \n> If I move D to (3,4), head at (3,4).\n> \n> Then from there, I can go to (3,3), (2,4), (4,4), etc., but direction will be D or whatever.\n> \n> But I want to go to (4,2) on turn 53.\n> \n> (4,2) is at (4,2), which is two moves away.\n> \n> From (3,4), to reach (4,2), I need to go right and down or something.\n> \n> (3,4) to (4,2): delta x=1, delta y=-2, so not adjacent directly.\n> \n> From (3,4), I can go to (4,4) then to (4,3) or (4,2)?

On turn 53, to move to (4,2), head must be at an adjacent cell on turn 52, but all adjacent cells are occupied, so head cannot be there.

        "thinking": "Let's break down the problem and determine the immediate action for the current turn \\( t_0 = 54 \\).\n\n### Current State:\n- **Snake Positions**: Head at (4,4), body segments follow as [(4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2)].\n- **Head Direction**: Down (D).\n- **Food**:\n  - (6,4): Value +1, Life Span 6.\n  - (3,1): Value +1, Life Span 8 (currently under the snake's body at segment 14).\n\n### Possible Actions:\nFrom the current head position (4,4) moving Down (D), the possible actions are:\n1. **Continue Down (D)**: Move to (4,3).\n   - Check: (4,3) is not a wall or occupied by the body. Safe.\n2. **Left (L)**: Move to (3,4).\n   - Check: (3,4) is not a wall or occupied by the body. Safe.\n3. **Right (R)**: Move to (5,4).\n   - Check: (5,4) is occupied by the body (segment 7). Not safe (collision).\n4. **Up (U)**: Reverse direction, not allowed.\n\nThus, the valid immediate actions are **D** or **L**.\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **Food at (6,4)**:\n   - Manhattan distance from (4,4) to (6,4) is 2, but the path is blocked by the body at (5,4).\n   - The food will disappear after turn 59 (life span 6 from turn 54). It's impossible to reach it in time because the blocking body segment (5,4) will only be freed after 7 moves (turn 61), which is too late.\n\n2. **Food at (3,1)**:\n   - Currently under the body (segment 14). It will be freed after 2 moves (on turn 56).\n   - To eat it, the head must be adjacent to (3,1) on turn 56 or later.\n   - A possible sequence:\n     - Turn 54: Move D to (4,3).\n     - Turn 55: Move D to (4,2).\n     - Turn 56: Move L to (3,2) (adjacent to (3,1)).\n     - Turn 57: Move D to (3,1) to eat the food.\n\n### Decision:\nThe best immediate action is to start moving towards the food at (3,1) by choosing **D (Down)** to (4,3). This sets up the sequence to safely eat the food at (3,1) on turn 57.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{D}",

It's turn 54. The grid has walls: border cells at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and an internal obstacle at (1,6). So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), but with walls on the borders and that one obstacle.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (4,4), then body segments: (4,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2). So the snake is 16 segments long. Head direction is down, which is decreasing y, I think? Let's confirm: U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), L is (x-1,y), R is (x+1,y). So head direction D means it's moving down, so y is decreasing.\n> \n> Head at (4,4), moving down, so next position would be (4,3) if it continues down, but we have to choose actions.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (6,4) with value 1 and life span 6. Life span 6 means it disappears after 6 turns, including the current turn, so it has 6 turns left starting from now.\n> \n> - (3,1) with value 1 and life span 8. Value is +1 for both, so both are positive food.\n> \n> (3,1) is also a snake position? Looking at snake positions: (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), etc. (3,1) is the 15th segment in the list? Let's list snake positions in order:\n> \n> Index 0: head (4,4)\n> \n> 1: (4,5)\n> \n> 2: (3,5)\n> \n> 3: (3,6)\n> \n> 4: (4,6)\n> \n> 5: (5,6)\n> \n> 6: (5,5)\n> \n> 7: (5,4) — this is adjacent to head? Head is (4,4), so (5,4) is right, but not same cell.\n> \n> 8: (5,3)\n> \n> 9: (6,3)\n> \n> 10: (6,2)\n> \n> 11: (5,2)\n> \n> 12: (5,1)\n> \n> 13: (4,1)\n> \n> 14: (3,1) — this is a body segment\n> \n> 15: (3,2)\n> \n> So (3,1) is a body segment, and there's food at (3,1) with value 1 and life span 8. But food can spawn under the snake's body, and it can only be eaten if the body moves away and then the head moves onto it.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (6,4) with value 1, life span 6.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead, prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> First, let's map out the grid to visualize.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls at borders and (1,6).\n> \n> Snake positions:\n> \n> - (4,4) head\n> \n> - (4,5) — above head? y=5 is higher y, since U is (x,y+1), so increasing y is up, decreasing y is down. So (4,5) is north of (4,4), since y+1.\n> \n> Coordinates: let's assume (0,0) is bottom-left? But in programming, often (0,0) is top-left. I need to clarify.\n> \n> The movement: U (x,y+1) — if y increases, it might be upward if (0,0) is bottom, or downward if (0,0) is top. But the problem doesn't specify, so I should think in terms of coordinates.\n> \n> Since walls are at y=0 and y=7, and U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), so if y=0 is bottom, then U increases y (up), D decreases y (down). If y=0 is top, U would decrease y? No.\n> \n> Standard: in grid problems, often (0,0) is top-left, y increases downward, or sometimes bottom-left, y increases upward.\n> \n> But the movement definitions: U (x,y+1) — if (0,0) is top-left, then y+1 is down, which is inconsistent with \"U\" for up.\n> \n> I think there's ambiguity. Let me read the movement: \"U(x,y+1), D(x,y-1), L(x-1,y), R(x+1,y)\"\n> \n> Typically, in such games, \"U\" means up, which decreases y if (0,0) is top-left, but here U is (x,y+1), so y+1 for up, which suggests that (0,0) might be bottom-left, so y increases as you go up.\n> \n> To avoid confusion, I should just think in terms of coordinates. Let's list the snake positions and see the head direction.\n> \n> Head at (4,4), direction D, which is (x,y-1), so from (4,4), moving to (4,3) would be down.\n> \n> Current body: (4,5) is at (4,5), which has higher y than head, so if y increases upward, then (4,5) is above (4,4), and head is moving down to (4,3), which has lower y.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,6) has high y, (5,1) has low y.\n> \n> Also, walls at y=0 and y=7, so y=0 is probably bottom or top.\n> \n> Since U is (x,y+1) and it's called \"U\" for up, it implies that y+1 is upward, so (0,0) is likely bottom-left, with y increasing upward.\n> \n> For example, from (4,4), U to (4,5) is up, D to (4,3) is down.\n> \n> Similarly, L to (3,4) left, R to (5,4) right.\n> \n> In the snake positions, (4,5) is directly above (4,4), since same x, y=5 vs y=4.\n> \n> Then (3,5) is left and up from head? Head (4,4), (3,5) is x=3, y=5, so left and up.\n> \n> But head is moving down, so from (4,4) to (4,3) if it continues.\n> \n> Now, food at (6,4): x=6,y=4, which is east of head at (4,4), since x=6 > x=4.\n> \n> Food at (3,1): x=3,y=1, which is west and south of head? Head (4,4), so (3,1) is left and down.\n> \n> But (3,1) is also a body segment, specifically the 14th position, which is near the tail.\n> \n> Tail is at (3,2) and (3,1) is before that? Positions: index 14: (3,1), index 15: (3,2). Since head is first, tail is last, so tail is (3,2), and (3,1) is the second last segment.\n> \n> Now, the food at (3,1) is under the body, so it can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves in.\n> \n> Similarly, for (6,4), it's not under snake, so it can be eaten directly.\n> \n> Life span: food at (6,4) has life 6, so it will disappear after 6 turns, meaning on turn 54+6=60 it will be gone, so it must be eaten by turn 59 or earlier? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 54, life span 6, after turn 54, it has 5 left, after turn 55, 4 left, ..., after turn 59, it has 0 left and disappears, so it can be eaten up to turn 59.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (3,1) life span 8, so it can be eaten up to turn 61.\n> \n> But since it's under the body, it's tricky.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan actions for multiple turns, at least 5 ahead.\n> \n> First, possible moves from current position.\n> \n> Head at (4,4), direction D, so moving down.\n> \n> Possible actions: U, D, L, R, but no instant reverse. Since current direction is D, reverse is U, so cannot move U next. So possible: D (continue down), L (left), R (right).\n> \n> Moving U would be reverse, not allowed.\n> \n> So options: D, L, or R.\n> \n> If move D: to (4,3)\n> \n> If move L: to (3,4)\n> \n> If move R: to (5,4)\n> \n> Now, check for collisions.\n> \n> First, walls: borders x=0,7 y=0,7, so (4,3) is x=4,y=3, which is within 1 to 6? x from 0 to 7, walls at x=0 and x=7, so x=1 to 6 are safe, similarly y=1 to 6 safe? y=0 and y=7 walls, so y=1 to 6 are safe? Let's see: y=0 is wall, y=7 wall, so cells with y=1,2,3,4,5,6 are not walls. Similarly x=1,2,3,4,5,6 not walls, except internal obstacles.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (1,6), which is not in the path.\n> \n> (4,3): x=4, y=3, not wall.\n> \n> Body: snake positions: (4,4) is head, moving to (4,3), which is not in current body positions? Current body: (4,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2)\n> \n> (4,3) is not in this list, so safe.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,4): not in list, and not wall.\n> \n> (5,4): (5,4) is in the list, index 7: (5,4), which is a body segment.\n> \n> If I move to (5,4), it's occupied by body, so collision.\n> \n> But is it the tail? Tail is (3,2), and (5,4) is not tail, it's a body segment, so if head moves to (5,4), it collides with body, death.\n> \n> However, note that if head moves to the tail cell, and tail moves away, it might be ok, but only if it's the current tail position.\n> \n> Rule: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> But for other body segments, not tail, it's collision.\n> \n> Here, (5,4) is index 7, not the tail, tail is (3,2), so moving to (5,4) would cause collision.\n> \n> Therefore, moving R to (5,4) is not possible, death.\n> \n> Similarly, moving to (3,4): is (3,4) occupied? Current positions: (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), etc., no (3,4), so not occupied, and not wall, so safe.\n> \n> Moving to (4,3): not occupied, not wall, safe.\n> \n> Moving U is not allowed because reverse.\n> \n> So possible actions: L to (3,4) or D to (4,3)\n> \n> Now, need to think ahead.\n> \n> Also, food: (6,4) is at (6,4), which is east, and (3,1) at (3,1) with food under body.\n> \n> I should plan a sequence.\n> \n> First, let's think about eating the food at (6,4). It has life span 6, so we have time, but it's close, at (6,4), head at (4,4), so two steps away if we go right, but we can't go directly right to (5,4) because it's occupied.\n> \n> From (4,4), to reach (6,4), we need to go east.\n> \n> But (5,4) is occupied, so we can't go directly.\n> \n> Possible to go around.\n> \n> For example, if we go down to (4,3), then we can go right to (5,3), but (5,3) is occupied? Current positions: (5,3) is index 8.\n> \n> (5,3) is a body segment, so moving to (5,3) would collide, unless it's tail, but tail is (3,2), not (5,3).\n> \n> Similarly, from (4,3), we could go down or left or right, but right to (5,3) is occupied.\n> \n> Let's list free cells around.\n> \n> Head at (4,4)\n> \n> North: (4,5) occupied\n> \n> South: (4,3) free\n> \n> West: (3,4) free\n> \n> East: (5,4) occupied\n> \n> So only south or west possible now.\n> \n> If I go south to (4,3):\n> \n> Then from (4,3), possible moves: U (back to (4,4), but reverse might not be allowed? Current direction after move: if I move D to (4,3), then direction is D, so from (4,3), cannot move U to (4,4) because reverse.\n> \n> Possible moves from (4,3): D to (4,2), L to (3,3), R to (5,3)\n> \n> Now, (4,2) not occupied? Current positions: (6,2), (5,2), etc., (4,2) not in list, so free.\n> \n> (3,3) not in list, free.\n> \n> (5,3) is occupied by body (index 8), so cannot move there.\n> \n> Also walls: (4,2) y=2>0, not wall; (3,3) x=3>0, not wall.\n> \n> So from (4,3), can go D to (4,2) or L to (3,3)\n> \n> If I go L to (3,4) from start:\n> \n> From (4,4) go L to (3,4)\n> \n> Then at (3,4), direction L (since moved left).\n> \n> Possible moves: U to (3,5), D to (3,3), L to (2,4), R to (4,4) but reverse not allowed, so no R.\n> \n> Now, (3,5) occupied? Current positions: (3,5) is index 2, occupied.\n> \n> (3,3) not occupied.\n> \n> (2,4) not occupied, not wall.\n> \n> So from (3,4), can go D to (3,3) or L to (2,4)\n> \n> Now, back to food.\n> \n> Food at (6,4) needs to be eaten. Head at (4,4), food at (6,4), so need to go east.\n> \n> But blocked by body at (5,4) and (5,5), etc.\n> \n> The body will move as the snake moves, so after a few moves, the tail will move, freeing up cells.\n> \n> Currently, tail is at (3,2). When the snake moves, the tail moves, so cells are freed.\n> \n> For example, if we move down to (4,3), the tail (3,2) will move to where? When head moves to new position, the tail segment is removed if no food eaten, but since we don't eat, length same, so tail moves, meaning (3,2) is freed, and the new tail is the previous one.\n> \n> Snake movement: when snake moves without eating, head moves to new cell, each segment moves to the next position, so the last segment (tail) is removed.\n> \n> So after one move, say to (4,3), the new positions: head (4,3), then body: old head (4,4) becomes segment 1, then (4,5), (3,5), etc., up to (3,1) becomes segment 14, and (3,2) is removed, so tail is now (3,1)? Let's see.\n> \n> Initial positions: indices 0 to 15: (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2)\n> \n> After moving head to new position, say (4,3), then new positions: head (4,3), then segment 1: old head (4,4), segment 2: (4,5), segment 3: (3,5), segment 4: (3,6), segment 5: (4,6), segment 6: (5,6), segment 7: (5,5), segment 8: (5,4), segment 9: (5,3), segment 10: (6,3), segment 11: (6,2), segment 12: (5,2), segment 13: (5,1), segment 14: (4,1), segment 15: (3,1) — and (3,2) is gone, so tail is (3,1).\n> \n> Similarly, if we move to (3,4), new head (3,4), body: (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), tail (3,2) gone, new tail (3,1).\n> \n> Now, food at (3,1) is under the body.

It's turn 54. The grid has walls: border cells at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and an internal obstacle at (1,6). So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), but with walls on the borders and that one obstacle.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (4,4), then body segments: (4,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2). So the snake is 16 segments long. Head direction is down, which is decreasing y, I think? Let's confirm: U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), L is (x-1,y), R is (x+1,y). So head direction D means it's moving down, so y is decreasing.\n> \n> Head at (4,4), moving down, so next position would be (4,3) if it continues down, but we have to choose actions.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (6,4) with value 1 and life span 6. Life span 6 means it disappears after 6 turns, including the current turn, so it has 6 turns left starting from now.\n> \n> - (3,1) with value 1 and life span 8. Value is +1 for both, so both are positive food.\n> \n> (3,1) is also a snake position? Looking at snake positions: (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), etc. (3,1) is the 15th segment in the list? Let's list snake positions in order:\n> \n> Index 0: head (4,4)\n> \n> 1: (4,5)\n> \n> 2: (3,5)\n> \n> 3: (3,6)\n> \n> 4: (4,6)\n> \n> 5: (5,6)\n> \n> 6: (5,5)\n> \n> 7: (5,4) — this is adjacent to head?

If y=0 is top, U would decrease y? No.\n> \n> Standard: in grid problems, often (0,0) is top-left, y increases downward, or sometimes bottom-left, y increases upward.\n> \n> But the movement definitions: U (x,y+1) — if (0,0) is top-left, then y+1 is down, which is inconsistent with \"U\" for up.\n> \n> I think there's ambiguity.

Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 54, life span 6, after turn 54, it has 5 left, after turn 55, 4 left, ..., after turn 59, it has 0 left and disappears, so it can be eaten up to turn 59.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (3,1) life span 8, so it can be eaten up to turn 61.\n> \n> But since it's under the body, it's tricky.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan actions for multiple turns, at least 5 ahead.\n> \n> First, possible moves from current position.\n> \n> Head at (4,4), direction D, so moving down.\n> \n> Possible actions: U, D, L, R, but no instant reverse.

Direction is down, meaning it was moving down to (4,2) from (4,1)? No, positions are head first, so from head to tail: (4,2) to (4,1) is the tail part. Let's see the sequence:\n> \n> Index 0: (4,2) head\n> \n> Index 1: (4,3) – but (4,3) is above (4,2) since y increases up? Typically in grids, y=0 is top or bottom? The movement: U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), so y+1 is up or down? Let's clarify the coordinate system.\n> \n> The movement definitions:\n> \n> - U: (x, y+1) – so increasing y is upward.\n> \n> - D: (x, y-1) – decreasing y is downward.\n> \n> - L: (x-1, y)\n> \n> - R: (x+1, y)\n> \n> Also, walls: y=0 and y=7 are borders, so y=0 is bottom?

Let's see snake positions: (6,2) is in the list, index 12: (6,2). But food at (6,2) is listed, so the food is under the snake body at (6,2).\n> \n> Similarly, (3,1) might be near tail or something.\n> \n> First, let's map the grid to visualize.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls: all cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, so playable area is x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? No.\n> \n> Border cells: x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. So cells like (0,0) to (0,7), (7,0) to (7,7), (0,0) to (7,0), (0,7) to (7,7) are walls. Internal: (1,6) is obstacle.\n> \n> So playable cells: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except (1,6) is blocked.\n> \n> x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, but (1,6) is obstacle, so that cell is wall.\n> \n> Now snake positions:\n> \n> List in order:\n> \n> 0: (4,2) head\n> \n> 1: (4,3)  // above head? y=3 > y=2, so since y increases up, (4,3) is north of (4,2)\n> \n> But head direction is D, down. How did it get to (4,2) with direction down? From where?\n> \n> Previous move: since positions are current, and head is at (4,2) with direction D, meaning it moved down to (4,2). From (4,3)? (4,3) is position 1, which is the first body segment.\n> \n> Let's think of the path. The snake was at previous positions. At turn 55, head was at (4,3) or something? Positions are given for turn 56.\n> \n> Snake positions: [(4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1)]\n> \n> So head at (4,2), then (4,3), which is same x, higher y, so north. Then (4,4) north, (4,5) north, then (3,5) west, (3,6) north, (4,6) east, (5,6) east, (5,5) south, (5,4) south, (5,3) south, (6,3) east, (6,2) south, (5,2) west, (5,1) south, (4,1) west.\n> \n> Direction is D, down, meaning it moved down to (4,2) from (4,3)? But (4,3) is the next segment, so yes, it came from (4,3) to (4,2), moving down to (4,2).\n> \n> Now, current head at (4,2), direction D.\n> \n> Possible moves: U, D, L, R. But no instant reverse, so cannot move up (U) because that would be opposite to current direction D. Current direction is D, so reverse is U, so cannot move U. Can move D, L, or R.\n> \n> Now, let's see the grid state.\n> \n> First, food:\n> \n> - (6,4): value 1, life span 4, meaning it disappears after 4 turns, including this one, so after turn 59 it's gone? Life span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 56, life span 4, so if not eaten, it will be there for turns 56,57,58,59, gone on turn 60? Let's clarify.\n> \n> Life span N: disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current. So at turn t, if life span is N, it will be gone after turn t + N - 1? For example, if at turn t, life span N, after turn t, it decreases to N-1 at turn t+1, and so on, until life span 0 at turn t + N, it disappears? The rule says: \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> I think it's: at the start of turn, if life span is K, after this turn it becomes K-1, and when K=0 after the turn, it disappears. But the food is present during the turn when life span >0.\n> \n> For eating, if head moves to food cell during a turn, it is eaten.\n> \n> So for food at (6,4), life span 4 at turn 56. So:\n> \n> - Turn 56: life span 4, present\n> \n> - Turn 57: life span 3, present\n> \n> - Turn 58: life span 2, present\n> \n> - Turn 59: life span 1, present\n> \n> - Turn 60: life span 0, disappears, not present.\n> \n> Similarly for others.\n> \n> Food at (3,1): life span 6 at turn 56, so lasts until turn 61.\n> \n> Food at (6,2): life span 9 at turn 56, lasts longer.\n> \n> But (6,2) has food, and snake body is at (6,2) currently? Position 12 is (6,2), which is a body segment. So food is under the body at (6,2).\n> \n> Similarly, (3,1) is at position 15? Tail is (4,1), and (5,1) is position 14, (4,1) is 15, so (3,1) is not occupied by snake, let's list all snake positions.\n> \n> Snake cells: (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1)\n> \n> So (6,2) is occupied, (3,1) is not in list, so free? (3,1) is a cell, let's see if it's wall or free.\n> \n> x=3,y=1, walls are borders and (1,6), so (3,1) is within 1-6,1-6, not wall, so free, but food is there.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,4) is free? x=6,y=4, not in snake positions, not wall, so free.\n> \n> (6,2) has food but occupied by snake body at (6,2).\n> \n> Now, for food under body, it can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves onto it.\n> \n> Specifically: the body moves away (so that cell becomes free), and then head moves onto it.\n> \n> But for that to happen, the snake must move such that the tail or body segment leaves that cell, and head moves to it.\n> \n> In this case, (6,2) is occupied by a body segment, which is part of the snake.\n> \n> Now, the snake will move, so each turn, the head moves to a new cell, and the tail moves forward, so the last cell is vacated, unless it eats food, then tail doesn't move, length increases.\n> \n> But for body segments, when the snake moves, the body follows, so a cell might be vacated only if it's the tail and no food eaten.\n> \n> For a body cell under which there is food, to eat it, we need that when the snake moves, that body segment moves away, exposing the food, and then later head can move to it.\n> \n> But in this case, (6,2) is position 12 in the snake, not the tail.\n> \n> Tail is at (4,1), index 15.\n> \n> So (6,2) is a middle segment.\n> \n> When the snake moves, if no food eaten, the tail moves, so the segment at (6,2) will move to where the previous segment was, but since it's not tail, it doesn't vacate immediately; the position shifts.\n> \n> For example, on turn 56, head moves to a new cell, say to (4,1) or wherever, but (4,1) is tail, so if head moves to (4,1), it would collide with tail? But rule says: you can move into tail cell because tail will move, so no collision if it's the tail.\n> \n> Collision rules: body collision if head touches any body segment except the tail, because tail moves.\n> \n> Specifically: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So moving to tail cell is safe, as long as it's the current tail.\n> \n> In this case, tail is at (4,1).\n> \n> Now back to food at (6,2): it's under the body at (6,2), which is a middle segment. To eat this food, we need to have that segment move away, which will happen when the snake moves, but since it's not tail, when the head moves, the entire body shifts, so the segment at (6,2) will move to the position of index 11, which is (6,3) currently? Let's see the order.\n> \n> After move, the new positions: head goes to new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment before it.\n> \n> So for example, if head moves to a new cell, then segment 1 moves to old head position, segment 2 to old segment 1 position, and so on, tail moves to old second last position, and if no food eaten, the old tail cell is vacated.\n> \n> But for a middle segment like (6,2), after move, it will be at a different position, so the cell (6,2) is vacated only if that segment was the last one to occupy it and it moves away, but in the shift, the cell (6,2) will be occupied by the next segment or vacated?\n> \n> Suppose at turn t, positions: P0, P1, P2, ..., Pk\n> \n> After move to new head position H, new positions: H, P0, P1, P2, ..., P_{k-1} if no food eaten, or H, P0, P1, ..., Pk if food eaten.\n> \n> In this case, for cell P_i, after move, it is occupied by P_{i-1} if no eat, or still P_i if eat and i not tail, but only if food eaten, the tail stays, so positions after eat: head at new, then P0, P1, ..., P_{k-1}, Pk (tail remains).\n> \n> But for a body cell, when no eat, after move, that cell is no longer occupied because the segment has moved to the previous position.\n> \n> Specifically, for any cell that was occupied by a segment, after a move with no eat, that cell is vacated if it was the tail position, or if it was a body position, it might be reoccupied by the next segment, but since positions shift, the cell that was P_i is now occupied by P_{i-1} for i>0, but P_i and P_{i-1} are different cells usually.\n> \n> In this case, for cell (6,2), which is currently occupied by segment 12.\n> \n> After a move with no food eaten, segment 12 will move to the position of segment 11, which is (6,3), and segment 13 will move to (6,2)?

No, the segment that was at index 12 is now at new position, but the cell (6,2) is now occupied by the segment that was previously at index 11, which is (6,3), so new segment 12 is at (6,3), new segment 13 is at (6,2), so (6,2) is still occupied, by a different segment.\n> \n> In terms of the cell, (6,2) is occupied after the move by new segment 13, which is the segment that was previously at (6,3), but now at (6,2).\n> \n> So the food at (6,2) is still under a body segment, specifically, after the move, it's under the segment that moved to it.\n> \n> To expose the food at (6,2), we need the segment currently there to move away and no other segment to move to it, which only happens if that position is vacated by the tail moving or something.\n> \n> But since it's a middle segment, when the snake moves, the cell is reoccupied immediately by the next segment, so the food is never exposed unless the snake moves in a way that the body leaves that cell empty, which is only possible if it was the tail and no eat, or if the snake turns and the body doesn't cover it.\n> \n> But for a cell with food under body, it can only be eaten if at some point, the body moves away, exposing the food, and then later the head moves to it.\n> \n> In this case, for (6,2), it's currently occupied, so after a move, it might still be occupied, as above.\n> \n> When will (6,2) be vacated?

Contains food (3, 1).\n\n4. **Risks**:\n   - Moving down to (3, 1) eats food but may trap the snake (as seen in the simulation where moving to (4, 1) leads to a dead end).\n   - (6, 4) is too far to reach before it disappears (turn 59).\n   - (6, 2) will be free after this turn (segment moves away), but reaching it requires careful navigation.\n\n### Decision:\n- **Avoid (3, 1) for now**: Eating it risks trapping the snake. The food will remain for 5 turns, so we can revisit it later when safer.\n- **Prioritize (6, 2)**: It will be free next turn (turn 58) and has a long life span (8 turns). We should start moving toward it.\n- **Immediate Move**: From (3, 2), move **left (L)** to (2, 2). This:\n  - Avoids the risky (3, 1) food.\n  - Starts a path toward the right side where (6, 2) is located.\n  - Keeps options open for future turns.\n\n### Next Steps:\nAfter moving left to (2, 2), the snake can begin navigating toward (6, 2) by changing direction upward or downward in subsequent turns.\n\n\\boxed{L}",

Head direction is left (L), so it was moving left to (3,2) from previous position.\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (6,4) with life span 3, value +1 (positive food)\n> \n> - (3,1) with life span 5, value +1\n> \n> - (6,2) with life span 8, value +1. But (6,2) is currently occupied by the snake! Let's check the snake positions: snake has segments at (6,2) and others. Specifically, (6,2) is the 14th segment? Let's list positions:\n> \n> Index 0: head (3,2)\n> \n> 1: (4,2)\n> \n> 2: (4,3)\n> \n> 3: (4,4)\n> \n> 4: (4,5)\n> \n> 5: (3,5)\n> \n> 6: (3,6)\n> \n> 7: (4,6)\n> \n> 8: (5,6)\n> \n> 9: (5,5)\n> \n> 10: (5,4)\n> \n> 11: (5,3)\n> \n> 12: (6,3)\n> \n> 13: (6,2)  <-- this is where food (6,2) is, but it's occupied by snake body.\n> \n> 14: (5,2)\n> \n> 15: (5,1)  <-- tail\n> \n> Food at (6,2) is under the snake body. But according to rules, it can only be eaten if the body moves away and the head moves onto it later. Since it's under the body now, we can't eat it immediately.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (6,4) and (3,1) are free, I think. Let's see if they are occupied.\n> \n> (6,4): is this a snake position? Snake has (5,4) at index 10, (6,3) at 12, (6,2) at 13, not (6,4). So (6,4) is free.\n> \n> (3,1): snake has (3,2) head, (3,5), (3,6), not (3,1). So free.\n> \n> Food (6,2) is on a body segment at (6,2), which is index 13 in the list.\n> \n> Now, head is at (3,2), moving left. Possible moves: since head direction is L, it can move left, up, or down, but not right because of no instant reverse. From (3,2), moving left would be to (2,2), but let's see if that's valid.\n> \n> First, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n> \n> Goal: eat positive food to grow and survive long.\n> \n> Available moves from (3,2):\n> \n> - Left (L): to (2,2)\n> \n> - Up (U): to (3,3)\n> \n> - Down (D): to (3,1)\n> \n> Cannot go right (R) to (4,2) because that's the body segment immediately behind, and also reverse direction not allowed? Head direction is L, so moving right would be opposite, so not allowed. Rules say: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\" So current direction is L, so cannot move R.\n> \n> So possible actions: L, U, D.\n> \n> Now, check for collisions:\n> \n> - Left to (2,2): is this wall or body? Walls: border x=0 to x=7, so x=2 is within, y=2 within. Internal obstacle (1,6), not here. Body: snake positions: (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), etc. (2,2) is not in the list, so should be free? Let's list all positions to verify.\n> \n> Snake positions: (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (5,1)\n> \n> So (2,2) is not occupied, so L to (2,2) is possible.\n> \n> Up to (3,3): (3,3) is not in the positions; positions have (4,3) at index 2, but not (3,3). So free.\n> \n> Down to (3,1): (3,1) is not occupied; tail is at (5,1), head is (3,2), so (3,1) should be free. Also, food is at (3,1) with life span 5.\n> \n> Food at (3,1) is positive and can be eaten if we move down.\n> \n> But we need to think long-term.\n> \n> Also, food at (6,4) and (6,2) but (6,2) is under body now.\n> \n> Life spans: food (6,4) has life span 3, so it will disappear after 3 turns including current? Countdown decreases every turn including current.\n> \n> Turn t=57, life span 3, so it will disappear after turn 59? Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So at turn t, if life span is L, it disappears after turn t + L - 1? For example, at turn t, life span L, after this turn, it decreases to L-1, and so on, until L=0 after L turns? But it says \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> I think it means: when food is spawned, it has life span N. At each turn, including the turn it was spawned, the countdown decreases by 1. When countdown reaches 0, it disappears before the next turn or after? The text says \"disappears after N turns\", meaning it is present for N turns.\n> \n> Standard way: if life span is L at turn t, it will be available until turn t + L - 1, and disappear at turn t + L.\n> \n> But let's see the input: food is given with life span at current turn.\n> \n> For example, food (6,4) has life span 3 at turn 57. So after turn 57, countdown to 2, then after turn 58, to 1, after turn 59, to 0 and disappear. So it can be eaten on turns 57, 58, 59, and gone on turn 60.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,1) life span 5: available turns 57 to 61, disappear turn 62.\n> \n> (6,2) life span 8: available turns 57 to 64, disappear turn 65. But it's under snake body now, so we can't eat it until the body moves away.\n> \n> Now, back to possible moves.\n> \n> From head (3,2), direction L.\n> \n> Options:\n> \n> - L to (2,2)\n> \n> - U to (3,3)\n> \n> - D to (3,1)  <-- this has food, so if we move here, we eat it, snake grows to length 17, tail stays or new segment? Eating positive food: \"Length of snake +1\", so after eating, snake gains a segment, so positions will have new head at (3,1), and tail remains? No, when snake moves, tail moves unless it eats food.\n> \n> Standard snake: when snake moves to a cell without food, it moves head to new cell, tail leaves last cell. If it moves to food, head moves to food, new segment added, so tail doesn't move, snake grows.\n> \n> In this case, if we move to (3,1) which has food, we eat it, so head moves to (3,1), and a new segment is added, so the tail doesn't move, snake becomes longer.\n> \n> But we need to check if it's safe.\n> \n> First, (3,1): is it safe? No walls, no body, as per positions.\n> \n> But there's a special case: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> Here, tail is at (5,1). Head at (3,2), moving to (3,1). Is (3,1) adjacent to tail? Tail is at (5,1), (3,1) is two cells away? Adjacent means neighboring cells, up/down/left/right.\n> \n> (3,1) and (5,1) are not adjacent; they are separated by (4,1), which is empty? (4,1) is not occupied; snake has (4,2), (5,1), etc., but (4,1) is free? Positions: (4,2) is index 1, (5,1) is tail, (5,2) is index 14? List: indices 0: (3,2), 1: (4,2), 14: (5,2), 15: (5,1)\n> \n> So cells: (4,1) is not occupied, so (3,1) is not adjacent to tail (5,1). Distance: x-diff 2, y same, so not adjacent. Adjacent would be (4,1) or (3,2) or (3,0) etc.\n> \n> So moving to (3,1) should be safe, and we eat food, grow to 17 segments.\n> \n> But we need to think long-term. Also, there might be risks.\n> \n> Another option: move left to (2,2) or up to (3,3).\n> \n> Food at (6,4) has only 3 turns left, so we might want to get it soon.\n> \n> But (6,4) is at (6,4), head at (3,2), so it's a bit far.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,1) is close.\n> \n> But let's simulate a few moves.\n> \n> First, I need to plan a sequence for 5+ turns.\n> \n> Since the snake is long, and grid is small, 8x8 with obstacles, space might be tight.\n> \n> Let me sketch the grid.\n> \n> Grid 8x8, x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n> \n> Walls: borders, so cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls? No, \"Cells occupied by walls: Border cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7.\" So all cells where x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. Also internal obstacle at (1,6).\n> \n> So playable area: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x from 1 to 6? x=0 is wall, x=1 to x=6 are free except internal obstacles, but walls are the cells, so cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls, meaning we cannot move there.\n> \n> Similarly, internal obstacle at (1,6), so that cell is blocked.\n> \n> So free cells: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except (1,6) is obstacle.\n> \n> y from 1 to 6? y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y from 1 to 6.\n> \n> x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except (1,6) is blocked.\n> \n> Now snake positions at turn 57:\n> \n> Head: (3,2)\n> \n> Body: (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (5,1)\n> \n> Tail: (5,1)\n> \n> Food: (6,4) life 3, (3,1) life 5, (6,2) life 8 but under body at (6,2)\n> \n> (6,2) is occupied by snake, so food there can't be eaten now.\n> \n> Now, possible actions at t=57:\n> \n> - D: to (3,1) - eat food, grow to 17, new head (3,1), direction down? After moving, head direction changes.\n> \n> After move, head direction is the direction moved.\n> \n> - L: to (2,2) - no food, so move head to (2,2), tail moves from (5,1) to? When no food eaten, snake moves: head to new position, each segment moves to previous position, tail leaves.\n> \n> So if move to (3,1) with food, head to (3,1), new segment, so positions: new head (3,1), then previous head (3,2) becomes body, and so on, tail (5,1) stays, new length 17.\n> \n> If move to (2,2) no food, head to (2,2), body segments move: (3,2) becomes body at (3,2), (4,2) to (4,2)? No: the segment that was at index 1 (4,2) moves to index 0 old position, which is (3,2), and so on, tail (5,1) is removed, new tail is the previous second last, which was (5,2)? Let's think.\n> \n> Standard snake movement:\n> \n> Positions list: [head, segment1, segment2, ..., tail]\n> \n> When moving to empty cell:\n> \n> - New head at new position\n> \n> - Each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment in the list\n> \n> - Last position (tail) is removed\n> \n> So new positions: [new_head, old_head, old_segment1, ..., old_second_last] , so tail removed.\n> \n> If eat food: new positions [new_head, old_head, old_segment1, ..., old_tail], so tail stays, new segment added.\n> \n> In this case, for move to (2,2) no food: new head (2,2), then body: old head (3,2), then (4,2), (4,3), ..., up to (5,2) which was index 14, and tail (5,1) removed. So new positions: [(2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2)]  length 16, tail is (5,2)\n> \n> Similarly for other moves.\n> \n> But for now, at t=57, moving to (3,1) with food: new positions: [(3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (5,1)]  length 17, tail (5,1)\n> \n> (5,1) is still there, but since we ate food, tail doesn't move, so (5,1) remains.\n> \n> Now, back to decision.\n> \n> If we move down to (3,1), we eat food immediately, grow, but then we are at (3,1), which might be cornered or something.\n> \n> Current position (3,2), moving down to (3,1).\n> \n> Then from (3,1), possible moves: L to (2,1), R to (4,1), U to (3,2), but (3,2) is now body, so cannot go there, and D to (3,0) but y=0 is wall, so cannot.\n> \n> y=0 is wall, so from (3,1), possible moves:\n> \n> - L to (2,1)  (if free)\n> \n> - R to (4,1)  (if free)\n> \n> - U to (3,2) but (3,2) is body, occupied, so cannot\n> \n> - D to (3,0) wall, cannot\n> \n> So only left or right.\n> \n> (2,1): is it free?

But (6,2) is still occupied unless the segment moves.\n> \n> If we don't eat food, tail is removed, and each body segment moves to the previous position.\n> \n> So for (6,2) at index 13, it will move to the old position of index 12, which is (6,3), so (6,2) is vacated only if no new segment moves in, but since the segment moves away, the cell is empty.\n> \n> When a segment moves from a cell, that cell is empty, unless the head or another segment moves to it simultaneously, but in snake, only one cell at a time.\n> \n> So when the snake moves, the head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so the cell that was occupied by the tail is vacated, and other cells may be vacated if the body moves to different positions.\n> \n> In this case, for cell (6,2), it is occupied by index 13. When snake moves, index 13 will move to the old position of index 12, which is (6,3). So if (6,3) is not the same as (6,2), which it's not, then (6,2) is vacated after the move.\n> \n> Similarly, the tail position is vacated.\n> \n> But for food to be eaten, the head needs to move to it when it is free.\n> \n> At turn 57, (6,2) has food under it, but it's occupied, so cannot eat. After the snake moves, if the body moves away, (6,2) might be free.\n> \n> Let's simulate a move.\n> \n> Suppose at turn 57, we move down to (3,1) and eat food.\n> \n> Then new positions: head at (3,1), body: (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (5,1)  length 17.\n> \n> (6,2) is still occupied by body.\n> \n> If we move without eating, say move left to (2,2).\n> \n> New positions: head (2,2), then (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2)  tail (5,2), length 16.\n> \n> (6,2) is still occupied, by the segment that was index 13, now at position old index 12?

It will move when the snake moves, to the position of the previous segment, which is index 12 (6,3). So it will move to (6,3) only if the previous segment was at (6,3), but in the move, it moves to the old position of index 12.\n> \n> In the example above, when we moved left, the segment that was at (6,2) moved to the old position of index 12, which is (6,3), so it left (6,2) and went to (6,3), so (6,2) is now free.\n> \n> In the new positions, (6,2) is not occupied; the cell is empty.\n> \n> In the move to (2,2), new positions have head at (2,2), and the body includes new index 13 at old (6,3), new index 14 at old (6,2), but old (6,2) is not in new positions; the positions are new cells.\n> \n> After move, the cell (6,2) is no longer occupied because the segment that was there moved to (6,3) (old position of index 12), so (6,2) is vacated.\n> \n> Similarly, in general, when the snake moves, the cells that were occupied may be vacated if the segments move to new positions.\n> \n> For (6,2), after any move that doesn't have the head moving there, it will be vacated because the segment moves to a different position.\n> \n> In this case, after turn 57 move, (6,2) will be free, and the food there can be eaten if the head moves to it on a subsequent turn.\n> \n> Similarly for other cells.\n> \n> So at turn 58, (6,2) food is available to eat.\n> \n> But we need to go there.\n> \n> First, let's focus on the short-life food at (6,4).\n> \n> (6,4) has life span 3 at turn 57, so available on turns 57,58,59.\n> \n> Turn 57: we can move to it?

It's turn 58, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since the walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. That means the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think? Let me confirm the coordinates.\n> \n> The walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the grid goes from x=1 to x=6 and y=1 to y=6? No, typically in such grids, the borders are at the edges, so cells from (0,0) to (7,7) might be the full grid, but walls occupy x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, meaning you can't go to those cells. So the playable cells are where x from 1 to 6 and y from 1 to 6? Let's see the snake positions: (2,2), (3,2), etc., and food at (6,4), (3,1), etc. (3,1) has y=1, which is not y=0, so y=1 should be playable. Similarly, x=6 is playable since wall is at x=7.\n> \n> Walls: border cells x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7. So cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Therefore, playable area is x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6. That's a 6x6 grid? x=1 to 6 inclusive is 6 cells, similarly y=1 to 6, so 6x6 playable area.\n> \n> Also, there's an internal obstacle at (1,6). (1,6) is within the grid, so it's blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (2,2), and the direction is L, which is left. So current head direction is left.\n> \n> Snake body: [(2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2)]\n> \n> Let me list the positions in order: head (2,2), then (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2).

Let me recall the core rules.\n> \n> Core rules: \"Length of snake +1\" when eating positive food. And \"the tail will also move forward\" unless eating.\n> \n> From movement constraints: \"the snake cannot move to these coordinates\" if wall or body, but can move to tail cell since tail moves.\n> \n> Also, for food under body: \"can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves on.\"\n> \n> In this case, for (1,2), it's not under body, it's free, so moving there eats it.\n> \n> Similarly, other foods.\n> \n> But there's a special case: Tail Reward Danger. If head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> In this state, where is tail? Tail is at (5,2). Head is at (2,2), not adjacent to (5,2). Adjacent means sharing an edge, so (2,2) and (5,2) are not adjacent; distance is 3 in x, same y, so not adjacent.\n> \n> So no issue.\n> \n> Now, let's look at the foods:\n> \n> - (6,4): value 1, life span 2, so must be eaten by turn 60 (since turn 58 current, life span 2: disappears after 2 turns, meaning if not eaten on turn 58 or 59, gone on turn 60? Life span decreases every turn including current.\n> \n> \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn including current\".\n> \n> For food at (6,4) with life span 2 on turn 58:\n> \n> - Turn 58: life span 2\n> \n> - Turn 59: life span 1 (if not eaten)\n> \n> - Turn 60: life span 0, disappears.\n> \n> So it can be eaten on turn 58 or 59.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,1): life span 4, turn 58:4, 59:3, 60:2, 61:1, 62:0, so eat by turn 61.\n> \n> (6,2): life span 7, turn 58:7, so eat by turn 64.\n> \n> (1,2): life span 10, eat by turn 67.\n> \n> (6,2) is currently occupied by snake body at segment 14. So it's under the body. To eat it, the body must move away, and head must move onto it.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (6,2) is on the body, so it can only be eaten when that segment moves away.\n> \n> Now, let's think about the snake's movement.\n> \n> Current head at (2,2), direction L.\n> \n> I need to plan a sequence of actions for at least 5 turns, but probably more to think ahead.\n> \n> First, possible moves from (2,2):\n> \n> - L to (1,2): eats food, since (1,2) has food.

New positions: head at (1,2), then the old head (2,2) becomes body, and so on, but since ate, tail doesn't move, so new tail is the old tail (5,2), and a new segment is added? When eating, the snake grows, so the length increases by one. After moving head to new cell, the tail remains in place, so the body extends.\n> \n> Standard: when you eat, after the move, the tail doesn't advance, so the new position is added at head, and tail stays, so the segment that was tail is still there, and a new segment is added after head moves.\n> \n> But in terms of positions, when head moves to new cell, if not eating, all segments shift, tail moves away.\n> \n> If eating, head moves to new cell, all segments shift except the tail doesn't move, so the tail position remains, and a new segment is created at the head's previous position? I'm confused.\n> \n> Core rules don't specify, but from common snake mechanics: when snake eats, it grows, so on the next move, the tail doesn't move, meaning that after moving head, the body follows, but since growth, the tail stays, so the grid cell that was tail is still occupied, and a new body segment is added where the head was before moving or something.\n> \n> Let's think carefully.\n> \n> Assume at time t, snake positions: head, body segments, tail.\n> \n> When you move to a new cell:\n> \n> - If no food, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, tail moves away from its position, so the old tail cell is free.\n> \n> - If food at new cell, head moves to new cell, eats food, then the body segments move as above, but the tail does not move, so the tail cell remains occupied, and the snake grows by one segment; effectively, the new head position is added, and the tail stays, so the old tail is now part of the body, and a new tail position is the same as old, but since tail doesn't move, the length increases.\n> \n> For example, suppose snake: head A, body B, tail C at positions P1, P2, P3.\n> \n> Move to new cell D.\n> \n> If no food, new positions: head D, body A, tail B. C is free.\n> \n> If food at D, head D, body A, body B, tail C. C remains, so positions D, A, B, C; C is still occupied.\n> \n> In this case, when eating, tail doesn't move, so the cell remains occupied.\n> \n> In our case, for the food at (6,2) on the body, it can only be eaten when that body segment moves away, meaning when the snake moves such that that segment is no longer there, and head moves to that cell later.\n> \n> But for now, back to turn 58.\n> \n> From (2,2), moving to (1,2) eats the food there, since it's free and has food.\n> \n> Then new snake positions: head at (1,2), then the old head (2,2) becomes the first body segment, and since ate, tail (5,2) remains, so the snake has 17 segments: (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2) — tail is still (5,2).\n> \n> Positions: after move to (1,2) and eat, new head (1,2), then the previous segments: the first body is the old head (2,2), then (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), ..., up to (6,2), (5,2). Since ate, tail doesn't move, so (5,2) is still tail, and (6,2) is second last.\n> \n> In the list, (6,2) was 14, (5,2) 15, after move, head to (1,2), so positions: (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2) — so tail at (5,2), and (6,2) is body.\n> \n> Direction is now L.\n> \n> But (1,2) is at the left edge.

That's 16 segments.\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (6,4) with value 1 and life span 1 (so it disappears after this turn if not eaten?)\n> \n> Life span: It says \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So at turn 59, if life span is 1, it will disappear after turn 59, meaning it can be eaten on turn 59 but not after. Similarly for others.\n> \n> Let's read carefully: \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> For food at (6,4): value=1, life_span=1. Since current turn is 59, it has life span 1, so after turn 59, it disappears. That means on turn 59, it can be eaten if the head moves there.\n> \n> Similarly:\n> \n> - (3,1) value=1, life_span=3. So it will disappear after turn 61? Countdown decreases every turn including current.\n> \n> Let's define the countdown. Suppose at turn t, food has life_span L. Then:\n> \n> - At turn t, countdown = L\n> \n> - After turn t, countdown becomes L-1\n> \n> - It disappears when countdown reaches 0 after the turn.\n> \n> But it says \"disappears after N turns\", meaning after N turns from now, it's gone.\n> \n> For food at turn t with life_span N:\n> \n> - It is present on turns t, t+1, ..., t+N-1\n> \n> - Disappears after turn t+N-1, so not available on turn t+N.\n> \n> For example, N=1: present only on turn t, disappears after turn t.\n> \n> N=2: present on turn t and t+1, disappears after turn t+1.\n> \n> In this case:\n> \n> - (6,4): life_span=1, turn 59. So it is only available on turn 59. If not eaten by turn 59, it disappears.\n> \n> - (3,1): life_span=3, turn 59. So available on turns 59, 60, 61. Disappears after turn 61.\n> \n> - (6,2): life_span=6, turn 59. Available on turns 59 to 64. Disappears after turn 64.\n> \n> - (1,2): life_span=9, turn 59. Available on turns 59 to 67. Disappears after turn 67.\n> \n> But (6,2) is also a food position? Snake positions include (6,2), which is the tail.\n> \n> Snake positions: tail is at (6,2), and there's food at (6,2) with value 1 and life span 6.\n> \n> But food can spawn under the snake's body. Rule says: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> So for (6,2), it's under the tail segment. To eat it, the tail must move away first, then the head moves to (6,2). But since the tail is at (6,2), when the snake moves, the tail will move only if the head eats food; otherwise, the tail moves forward.\n> \n> Standard snake mechanics: when the snake moves, if it doesn't eat food, the tail moves to the next position, so the cell is vacated. If it eats food, the tail stays, and snake grows.\n> \n> But here, food is under the body, so we need to move so that the body part leaves, then head can come to eat.\n> \n> Specifically for (6,2): it's occupied by the tail. When the snake moves without eating, the tail moves away, so (6,2) is vacated. Then, if the head moves to (6,2) later, it can eat the food if it's still there.\n> \n> But the food has a life span; it might disappear.\n> \n> Also, there's a special case: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> Now, let's see the current head position and direction.\n> \n> Head at (2,1), direction D (down). So moving down, which is decreasing y? Coordinates: usually (x,y), with U: (x,y+1), D: (x,y-1), L: (x-1,y), R: (x+1,y). But in the state, walls y=0 and y=7, with y=0 probably bottom or top? It doesn't specify, but since D is (x,y-1), that might mean y decreases downward, so y=0 is bottom, y=7 top? Let's see.\n> \n> Snake positions: head (2,1), then (2,2), which is above it since y=2 > y=1, so U is increasing y, D is decreasing y. So y=0 is bottom, y=7 top. x=0 left, x=7 right.\n> \n> Head at (2,1), direction D, so it just moved to (2,1) from (2,2)? Positions list: [(2,1), (2,2), ...] head first, so at turn 59, head is at (2,1), which it just moved to, and previous head was at (2,2) at turn 58, I think. But direction is given as D, meaning current direction is down.\n> \n> From positions, from (2,2) to (2,1), so it moved down to (2,1).\n> \n> Now possible moves from (2,1): since direction is D, it can move L, R, or D, but not U because no instant reverse. Current direction D, so cannot move U (up) next. Possible moves: D (down to (2,0)), L (left to (1,1)), R (right to (3,1)).\n> \n> But (2,0) is y=0, which is a wall, so cannot move there. x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7 are walls, so (2,0) is invalid.\n> \n> Also, internal obstacle at (1,6), but we're at (2,1), so not relevant now.\n> \n> So from (2,1), possible moves:\n> \n> - L: to (1,1)\n> \n> - R: to (3,1)\n> \n> Cannot D to (2,0) because wall, cannot U because reverse not allowed.\n> \n> Now, food locations:\n> \n> - (6,4): value +1, life 1, so must eat now or never.\n> \n> - (3,1): value +1, life 3, available turns 59,60,61\n> \n> - (6,2): value +1, life 6, available turns 59-64\n> \n> - (1,2): value +1, life 9, available turns 59-67\n> \n> But (6,2) is currently occupied by the tail. Snake positions: tail is (6,2), and food is at (6,2). So to eat it, we need the tail to move away first.\n> \n> Similarly, other foods.\n> \n> First, the food at (6,4) has only this turn to be eaten. Can we reach it?\n> \n> Head at (2,1), (6,4) is 4 units away in x and 3 in y, |dx|=4, |dy|=3, so min moves 7, but we can only move one step per turn, so impossible to reach in one turn. Turn 59, we can only move to adjacent cells: (1,1) or (3,1). From there, (6,4) is still far. So we cannot eat (6,4) this turn; it will disappear after this turn. So effectively, we can ignore it, as it's not reachable in time.\n> \n> Now, other foods: (3,1) is adjacent to head? Head at (2,1), so (3,1) is to the right, one move R.\n> \n> (3,1) is empty? Let's see if it's occupied by snake.\n> \n> Snake positions: list is [(2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2)]\n> \n> So (3,1) is not in the list, so it's free. Also, no wall or obstacle there.\n> \n> So from (2,1), moving R to (3,1) would eat the food at (3,1), since it's positive food, value +1, so snake would grow, length increases.\n> \n> But we need to think about the consequences.\n> \n> Similarly, moving L to (1,1), which has no food mentioned, so no eat, snake moves, tail moves.\n> \n> Now, also, (1,2) has food, but (1,2) is currently occupied by the snake? Snake positions: (2,2) is the second segment, which is at (2,2), and (1,2) is not listed, so it should be free, but food is at (1,2), so we can go there later.\n> \n> (1,2) is left and up from head? Head (2,1), (1,2) is x-1, y+1, so not adjacent; adjacent are (1,1), (3,1), (2,2), but (2,2) is body.\n> \n> Possible adjacent cells from (2,1): (1,1), (3,1), (2,0) invalid, (2,2) but (2,2) is occupied by body, so cannot move there.\n> \n> So only (1,1) and (3,1) are possible moves.\n> \n> (3,1) has food, so moving there eats it.\n> \n> (1,1) has no food, so just move.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score and survival.\n> \n> First, if we move to (3,1), we eat the food, so snake grows to 17 segments. New head at (3,1), and since we ate, the tail doesn't move, so tail stays at (6,2).\n> \n> After eating, positions: head to (3,1), then the body: previous head (2,1) becomes new segment 1, then (2,2), etc., up to tail (6,2) still there.\n> \n> Snake grows when it eats, so the tail doesn't advance; a new segment is added at the head position after move.\n> \n> Sequence: when head moves to a cell with food, it eats, so the new position is added as head, and tail remains, so length increases by one.\n> \n> If no food, head moves to new cell, tail moves to next, so length same.\n> \n> In this case, move R to (3,1): eat food, so new positions: head at (3,1), then (2,1), (2,2), ..., up to (6,2), so 17 segments.\n> \n> Direction: since we moved R, new head direction is R.\n> \n> Then possible next moves.\n> \n> If we move L to (1,1): no food, so head moves to (1,1), tail moves from (6,2) to the next, which is? Current tail is (6,2), and the segment before is (6,3)? Positions: ... (5,3), (6,3), (6,2) tail.\n> \n> So when head moves to (1,1), no eat, so tail moves: (6,2) is removed, and the new tail is (6,3)? Let's see the body order.\n> \n> Positions: index 0: head (2,1), 1: (2,2), 2: (3,2), 3: (4,2), 4: (4,3), 5: (4,4), 6: (4,5), 7: (3,5), 8: (3,6), 9: (4,6), 10: (5,6), 11: (5,5), 12: (5,4), 13: (5,3), 14: (6,3), 15: (6,2) tail.\n> \n> So when snake moves without eating, head moves to new position, say (1,1), then new positions: head (1,1), then body [ (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), ..., (5,3), (6,3) ] and tail (6,2) is gone, so new tail is (6,3)? After moving, the segment that was (6,2) is removed, and the new tail is the one that was before it, which is (6,3), but (6,3) is now the last segment.\n> \n> In the list, position 14 is (6,3), position 15 is (6,2). When no eat, head moves to new cell, each segment moves to the next position, so position 1 moves to where head was, position 2 to where position 1 was, etc., and tail (position 15) is removed.\n> \n> So new positions: head at new cell, then body at previous head position, then previous position 1, etc., up to previous position 14, which was (6,3).\n> \n> So new tail is (6,3).\n> \n> Similarly, if we move to (3,1) and eat, then head at (3,1), body includes (2,1), (2,2), ..., up to (6,2), tail (6,2).\n> \n> Now, back to decision.\n> \n> Option 1: Move R to (3,1) - eat food, get +1, grow to 17.\n> \n> Option 2: Move L to (1,1) - no eat, move to (1,1), tail moves to (6,3).\n> \n> Now, we need to think ahead.\n> \n> Also, there's food at (1,2) and (6,2), etc.\n> \n> But (6,2) has food under tail, so we need to access it later.\n> \n> First, let's consider moving to (3,1).\n> \n> After move R to (3,1): head at (3,1), direction R.\n> \n> Then possible moves from there: since direction R, can move U, D, R (not L, reverse not allowed).\n> \n> Adjacent cells: U: (3,2) - but (3,2) is occupied by body? Current positions after move: head (3,1), then (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), ... so (3,2) is the third segment? After move to (3,1) and eat, positions: [ (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), ... (6,2) ] so (3,2) is the fourth position, occupied.\n> \n> So U to (3,2) is invalid, collision.\n> \n> D: (3,0) - but y=0 is wall, invalid.\n> \n> R: (4,1) - is it free? Not in positions, no wall, so possible.\n> \n> L: but cannot, reverse.\n> \n> So only possible move from (3,1) after moving there is R to (4,1).\n> \n> (4,1) is not occupied? Positions have (4,2), (4,3), etc., but not (4,1), so yes, free.\n> \n> No food at (4,1), so move to (4,1), no eat, tail moves? Since we ate at (3,1), snake grew, tail stayed. Now moving to (4,1) no food, so head to (4,1), tail moves: the tail (6,2) is removed, new tail is the previous second last, which was (5,3) or something.\n> \n> After eating at (3,1), positions: head (3,1), body: (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), ..., (6,2) — 17 segments.\n> \n> Now move to (4,1): no food, so new head at (4,1), then body: (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), ..., up to (6,3)?

It's turn 61, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid is from (0,0) to (7,7), but (0,0) to (7,7) inclusive? Walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6)? Let me confirm.\n> \n> Border cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7. So any cell with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 is a wall. Therefore, the playable grid is from (1,1) to (6,6). Also, there's an internal obstacle at (1,6).\n> \n> Snake positions: Head is at (4,1), and direction is R (right). So current head is (4,1), moving right.\n> \n> List of positions: [(4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (6,3)]\n> \n> That's 17 segments. Let me count: 1.(4,1), 2.(3,1), 3.(2,1), 4.(2,2), 5.(3,2), 6.(4,2), 7.(4,3), 8.(4,4), 9.(4,5), 10.(3,5), 11.(3,6), 12.(4,6), 13.(5,6), 14.(5,5), 15.(5,4), 16.(5,3), 17.(6,3). Yes, 17 cells long.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (6,2) with life span 5, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (1,2) with life span 7, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (4,3) with life span 10, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> All food is positive, value 1, so eating any gives +1 score and increases length by 1.\n> \n> Now, head is at (4,1), moving right. So from (4,1), possible moves: U (up to (4,2)), D (down to (4,0) but y=0 is wall, so invalid), L (left to (3,1)), R (right to (5,1)).\n> \n> Current direction is R, so I can't move left (opposite) instantly? No instant reverse rule: cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn. Current direction is R, so opposite is L, so I cannot move L on this turn.

Countdown decreases every turn including current, so at turn 61, life span 5, so it will disappear at turn 61 + 5 - 1? Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span).

Snake positions: (4,2) is position 6, so it's a body segment. But when I move, the snake moves: head to new position, each segment moves to previous position, tail is removed if no food eaten.\n> \n> Since no food is eaten this turn, moving to (4,2) would cause head to collide with body at (4,2), which is deadly.\n> \n> Confirm: if I move to a cell occupied by body, it's collision, except if it's the tail cell, because tail moves away.\n> \n> The tail cell is (6,3). If head moves to tail cell, it's ok because tail moves forward, so no collision.\n> \n> But (4,2) is not the tail; it's a body segment.\n> \n> Positions: head at (4,1), moving to (4,2). (4,2) is currently occupied by the 6th segment, which is not the tail. After move, head goes to (4,2), and the body segment that was at (4,2) will move to where? Let's simulate the move.\n> \n> Current positions: index 0: head (4,1), 1: (3,1), 2: (2,1), 3: (2,2), 4: (3,2), 5: (4,2), 6: (4,3), etc.\n> \n> If I move U to (4,2), new head position (4,2). But (4,2) is currently occupied by segment 5. After the move, the new snake will be: head at (4,2), then segment 1 at old head (4,1), segment 2 at (3,1), and so on, up to tail.\n> \n> Specifically, after moving to (4,2), the cell (4,2) is now the head, but it was previously occupied by segment 5, so when the snake moves, segment 5 is still there until it moves, but since head moves first, it might collide.\n> \n> Rule: body collision if head touches any body segment. At the moment of move, if the new head position is occupied by any body segment except the tail, it's a collision.\n> \n> Here, (4,2) is occupied by segment 5, not tail, so moving to (4,2) would cause head to touch body, collision, death.\n> \n> Therefore, moving U to (4,2) is invalid, deadly.\n> \n> Similarly, moving R to (5,1): (5,1) is free? Let's see what cells are occupied.\n> \n> Occupied cells: all snake positions: (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (6,3)\n> \n> So (5,1) is not in this list, so it should be free. Also, walls: only borders and (1,6), so (5,1) should be empty and safe.\n> \n> Moving R to (5,1) should be safe.\n> \n> D is wall, L is opposite and forbidden.\n> \n> So for turn 61, only possible move is R to (5,1).\n> \n> Is that right?

When snake moves without eating, tail is removed.\n> \n> After move U to (5,2), new head position (5,2), then body: previous head (5,1) becomes new segment 1, then (4,1) becomes segment 2, etc., up to (5,4) becomes segment 15, and tail (5,3) is removed? Let's think.\n> \n> Snake positions after move: new head at (5,2), then the old head (5,1) is now the first body segment, then (4,1) is second, (3,1) third, (2,1) fourth, (2,2) fifth, (3,2) sixth, (4,2) seventh, (4,3) eighth, (4,4) ninth, (4,5) tenth, (3,5) eleventh, (3,6) twelfth, (4,6) thirteenth, (5,6) fourteenth, (5,5) fifteenth, (5,4) sixteenth, and (5,3) is not included because tail moved, so new tail is (5,4)? Positions: the segment that was at index 15 is (5,4), which becomes the new tail? After move, the body segments from index 1 to 16 are the old positions from index 0 to 15, but index 16 was tail, removed.\n> \n> Old positions: index 0: (5,1) head, 1: (4,1), ..., 15: (5,4), 16: (5,3) tail.\n> \n> After moving head to new position without eating, new head at new pos, new body: old head, old body up to second last, tail removed.\n> \n> So new positions: head at (5,2), then body: old head (5,1) at index 1, old index 1 (4,1) at index 2, ..., old index 15 (5,4) at index 16? Let's count indices.\n> \n> Old snake has 17 segments: indices 0 to 16.\n> \n> After move, if no food eaten, new snake has same length, positions: new head at new pos, then old segments from index 0 to 15 become new indices 1 to 16. Old index 16 (tail) is removed.\n> \n> So new positions: head at (5,2), then index 1: old head (5,1), index 2: old index 1 (4,1), index 3: old index 2 (3,1), ..., up to index 16: old index 15 (5,4). Old index 16 (5,3) removed.\n> \n> Similarly, if I move R to (6,1), new head at (6,1), body: old head (5,1), then (4,1), ..., up to (5,4), tail (5,3) removed.\n> \n> Now, back to choices.\n> \n> From (5,1), move U to (5,2) or R to (6,1).\n> \n> If I go R to (6,1), that position has no food, so just move there. Then head at (6,1), direction R.\n> \n> From there, possible moves: U, D, L, R? Current direction R, so cannot move L (left).\n> \n> U to (6,2)? (6,2) has food! Value 1, positive.\n> \n> D to (6,0), but y=0 wall, invalid.\n> \n> R to (7,1), but x=7 wall, invalid.\n> \n> So from (6,1), only possible moves: U to (6,2) or L to (5,1). But L to (5,1) is left, which is opposite of current direction R, so cannot move L. Instant reverse not allowed.\n> \n> Therefore, from (6,1), only possible move is U to (6,2).\n> \n> Because D and R are walls, L is reverse, forbidden.\n> \n> So if I go R to (6,1) now, then next turn I must go U to (6,2), and eat the food there, since (6,2) has food.\n> \n> Then snake grows by one, so after eating, tail doesn't move, new segment added.\n> \n> But let's see the sequence.\n> \n> Turn 62: move R to (6,1) — no food, so snake moves, tail removed.\n> \n> Then turn 63: from (6,1), move U to (6,2) — food at (6,2), so eat it, head moves to (6,2), body: old head (6,1) becomes first body segment, then the previous body positions, and tail stays, so snake grows to 18 segments.\n> \n> Then from (6,2), I can move to adjacent cells.\n> \n> But (6,2) is at right edge, x=6, y=2.\n> \n> Possible moves: U to (6,3), D to (6,1), L to (5,2), R to (7,2) invalid (wall).\n> \n> Current direction after moving U to (6,2) is U (up), so cannot move D (down) next, opposite.\n> \n> So possible: U to (6,3), L to (5,2), or R invalid.\n> \n> D is opposite, forbidden.\n> \n> So U or L.\n> \n> (6,3): is it free?

Old positions had (4,2) as segment 6, but after move, (4,2) is still part of body? New positions: after moving head to (5,2), the body segments are old head (5,1) and old body up to index 15 (5,4).\n> \n> Old index 6 was (4,2), which is now new index 7? Let's not get bogged down.\n> \n> Generally, the cells occupied after move: since we moved to (5,2), and old positions except tail are kept, so occupied cells: (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4)\n> \n> So (4,2) is occupied, (5,3) is free, (6,2) has food but is free.\n> \n> So from (5,2), move U to (5,3): free, no food.\n> \n> L to (4,2): occupied, cannot, collision.\n> \n> R to (6,2): free, has food.\n> \n> So only possible moves from (5,2) after U move: U to (5,3) or R to (6,2).\n> \n> Cannot L to (4,2) because it's occupied.\n> \n> Now, back to planning.\n> \n> I need to think about long-term survival and maximizing score.\n> \n> Food available: (6,2) must be eaten soon, life span 4, so by turn 65.\n> \n> (1,2) life span 6, by turn 67.\n> \n> (4,3) life span 9, longer, but it's under body now.\n> \n> Also, (4,3) is currently occupied, so need to move body away to eat it.\n> \n> Moreover, there's a risk with tail reward danger if head adjacent to tail and tail has food.\n> \n> But tail is at (5,3) now, and no food there, so not immediate issue.\n> \n> First, let's consider the two paths.\n> \n> Option A: Turn 62 move R to (6,1), then turn 63 must move U to (6,2) to eat food.

No, when no food is eaten, the snake length does not increase, so when it moves, the tail is removed, so length decreases by 1 if it was grown, but in standard Snake, when no food, length stays the same, but the tail moves forward, so the number of segments is constant.\n> \n> I think I have a confusion.\n> \n> In Snake game, when the snake moves:\n> - If no food eaten, head moves to new cell, tail cell is left, so the snake occupies the same number of cells, but shifted.\n> - If food eaten, head moves to food cell, tail does not move, so snake grows by one cell.\n> \n> In terms of segments, the number of segments increases only when food is eaten.\n> \n> Otherwise, it remains the same.\n> \n> In this case, at turn 63, after eating food, snake has 18 segments.\n> \n> If on turn 64, no food eaten, then when moving, the head moves to a new cell, the tail cell is vacated, and the new snake has 18 segments: new head, and the previous segments from 0 to 16 (since previous 0 to 17, but 17 is tail, removed, so new body is previous 0 to 16).\n> \n> Previous positions: let's call P[0] to P[17] for 18 segments.\n> \n> After move to new_head no eat, new positions: [new_head] + P[0:17] but P[0:17] is P[0] to P[16], which is 17 segments, then [new_head] + that is 18 segments, with P[17] removed.\n> \n> P[0:17] in Python is from 0 to 16 inclusive.\n> \n> So new positions: new_head, P[0], P[1], ..., P[16] — 18 positions, but P[17] is not included.\n> \n> P[0] to P[16] is 17 positions, plus new_head, 18.\n> \n> P[0] is the old head, which is now body.\n> \n> In the list, for example, after turn 63, P[0] = (6,2), P[1] = (6,1), P[2] = (5,1), ..., P[16] = (5,5), P[17] = (5,4).\n> \n> After move to (5,2) no eat, new positions: new_head (5,2), then P[0] (6,2), P[1] (6,1), P[2] (5,1), ..., up to P[16] (5,5).

Let me count: positions from head to tail.\n> \n> Head: (6,1)\n> \n> Then: (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1) — that's 5 segments in row y=1.\n> \n> Then (2,2) — up to (2,2)\n> \n> (3,2), (4,2) — back to x=4,y=2\n> \n> Then (4,3), (4,4), (4,5) — up in y\n> \n> (3,5) — left to x=3,y=5\n> \n> (3,6) — up to y=6\n> \n> (4,6) — right to x=4,y=6\n> \n> (5,6) — right to x=5,y=6\n> \n> (5,5) — down to y=5\n> \n> (5,4) — down to y=4\n> \n> Tail is (5,4).\n> \n> So the snake is long, 17 segments.\n> \n> Food:\n> \n> - (6,2) with life span 3, value +1 (positive food)\n> \n> - (1,2) with life span 5, value +1\n> \n> - (4,3) with life span 8, value +1? It says \"Value and Life Span\", but in the input it's given as (x,y, life_span, value)? Let me check.\n> \n> It says: \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value: - (6, 2, 3, 1) - (1, 2, 5, 1) - (4, 3, 8, 1)\"\n> \n> So for (6,2): x=6,y=2, life_span=3, value=1\n> \n> Similarly, (1,2): life_span=5, value=1\n> \n> (4,3): life_span=8, value=1\n> \n> All are positive food, value +1.\n> \n> Life span decreases each turn, including current turn. So on turn 63, for (6,2), life_span=3, meaning it will disappear after 3 more turns? Let's see the rule.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So at the time of state, life_span is given. After each turn, it decreases by 1. When it reaches 0, it disappears.\n> \n> For (6,2): life_span=3 on turn 63. So after turn 63, it becomes 2, then after turn 64, it becomes 1, then after turn 65, it becomes 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten until turn 65 inclusive? When is it eaten?\n> \n> The food is eaten when the head moves onto it. So on turn t, if head moves to food cell, it is eaten at that turn.\n> \n> Life span: countdown decreases every turn, including when the snake moves.\n> \n> For food at (6,2) with life_span=3 on turn 63:\n> \n> - On turn 63: life_span=3, available\n> \n> - After turn 63, life_span=2\n> \n> - On turn 64: life_span=2, available\n> \n> - After turn 64, life_span=1\n> \n> - On turn 65: life_span=1, available\n> \n> - After turn 65, life_span=0, disappears, not available on turn 66.\n> \n> Similarly for others.\n> \n> (1,2): life_span=5 on turn 63, so available until turn 67 inclusive? Let's compute:\n> \n> Turn 63: life_span=5\n> \n> After turn 63: 4\n> \n> Turn 64: 4\n> \n> After turn 64: 3\n> \n> Turn 65: 3\n> \n> After turn 65: 2\n> \n> Turn 66: 2\n> \n> After turn 66: 1\n> \n> Turn 67: 1\n> \n> After turn 67: 0, gone on turn 68.\n> \n> Life span N means it disappears after N turns from current, so it exists for N turns including current? The rule says \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> I think it's better to think: at the start of turn, before action, the food is present if life_span > 0. After the turn, life_span decreases by 1.\n> \n> So for a food with life_span L at turn t:\n> \n> - It is present on turn t, and can be eaten on turn t.\n> \n> - After turn t, life_span becomes L-1.\n> \n> - If L-1 > 0, it is present on turn t+1, and so on.\n> \n> - When life_span reaches 0, it disappears before the next turn.\n> \n> For (6,2): L=3 on turn 63, so present on turns 63,64,65. After turn 65, L=0, gone on turn 66.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,2): L=5, present on turns 63,64,65,66,67. After turn 67, L=0, gone on turn 68.\n> \n> (4,3): L=8, present on turns 63 to 70.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (6,1), direction R (right). So moving right, to (7,1)? But x=7 is a wall, since border cells x=7 is wall.\n> \n> Border cells: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. So (7,1) is a wall, cannot move there.\n> \n> Also, internal obstacle at (1,6).\n> \n> Snake head is at (6,1), moving right. But (7,1) is wall, so it cannot move right. That means on this turn, turn 63, the snake must choose a different direction, but it has a current direction of R, but since (7,1) is invalid, it has to turn.\n> \n> The movement constraint: \"In each turn you can choose to move 1 cell in following directions: U, D, L, R\"\n> \n> And \"No instant reverse\": Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\n> \n> Current direction is R, so opposite is L. So it cannot move left immediately, but since moving right is blocked, it must move up or down.\n> \n> Available moves from (6,1):\n> \n> - Up: (6,2)\n> \n> - Down: (6,0) but y=0 is wall, so invalid\n> \n> - Left: (5,1) but (5,1) is the body segment, second position.\n> \n> Snake positions: head (6,1), then (5,1), which is directly left.\n> \n> If it moves left to (5,1), that is the body, but it's the segment that will become the tail? Let's see collision rule.\n> \n> \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So moving to a body segment is deadly unless it's the tail segment.\n> \n> In this case, (5,1) is the second segment, not the tail. Tail is at (5,4).\n> \n> So moving to (5,1) would collide with body, die.\n> \n> Similarly, moving down to (6,0) is wall, die.\n> \n> Moving right to (7,1) is wall, die.\n> \n> Only possible move is up to (6,2).\n> \n> (6,2) is a food position?

I have to move up.\n> \n> So for turn 63, action must be U.\n> \n> Now, after moving to (6,2), the snake eats the food, so length increases by 1. New head position (6,2), and the tail doesn't move yet? When the snake eats food, the head moves to the food cell, and the body follows, but since it eats, the tail stays in place, so new segment is added.\n> \n> Standard snake: when you eat, head moves to food, body follows, tail doesn't move, so length increases.\n> \n> In terms of positions: after moving to (6,2), which has food, so head is now at (6,2), the previous head (6,1) becomes part of body, and tail remains, but since we ate, the tail doesn't advance, so the new positions: head (6,2), then (6,1), then (5,1), ... up to tail (5,4). And since we ate, the tail stays, so positions: [ (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4) ] — now 18 segments, tail still at (5,4).\n> \n> Previous was 17 segments, after eating, 18 segments, tail at (5,4).\n> \n> Food at (6,2) is consumed, so removed.\n> \n> Now, head direction: since I moved U, new direction is U.\n> \n> Current turn 63, I moved U.\n> \n> Now, for next turns, I need to plan 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> First, what about other food?\n> \n> Food left: (1,2) with life_span 5, value +1, and (4,3) with life_span 8, value +1.\n> \n> (4,3) is currently occupied by the snake body! Look at snake positions: (4,3) is the 9th segment or so, it's part of the body.\n> \n> But food is at (4,3), so it's under the body.\n> \n> Rule: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> So (4,3) has food under it, but since body is there, it cannot be eaten until the snake moves away and head comes back.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,2) is free, I think. Is (1,2) occupied? Snake positions: (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), etc., not (1,2), so (1,2) is free, with food.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (1,6), but (1,2) is different.\n> \n> Now, after turn 63, head at (6,2), direction U.\n> \n> Now, available moves from (6,2):\n> \n> - U: (6,3)\n> \n> - D: (6,1) — but (6,1) is now the second segment, body\n> \n> - L: (5,2)\n> \n> - R: (7,2) — but x=7 wall, invalid\n> \n> Now, (6,1) is body, not tail, so moving down to (6,1) would collide, invalid.\n> \n> Moving right to (7,2) wall, invalid.\n> \n> So possible: up to (6,3) or left to (5,2).\n> \n> Now, (5,2): is it free?

Cannot reverse to D.\n\n### Immediate Options:\n1. **Move U (Up) to (6, 3)**:\n   - (6, 3) is free (no wall or body).\n   - Next turn (65), can move L to (5, 3) to eat food at (5, 3).\n   - After eating, must move U to (5, 4) to avoid trapping the snake.\n\n2. **Move L (Left) to (5, 2)**:\n   - (5, 2) is free.\n   - Next turn (65), must move U to (5, 3) to eat food at (5, 3).\n   - After eating, must move U to (5, 4) to avoid trapping the snake.\n\n### Key Observations:\n- Both options lead to eating (5, 3) at turn 65, but moving U first (option 1) is slightly better because it keeps more options open for future moves.\n- The food at (1, 2) is unreachable within its lifespan (4 turns), so it can be ignored.\n- The food at (4, 3) is under the snake's body and cannot be eaten immediately. It requires the body to move away first, which is not feasible in the short term.\n\n### Decision:\n- **Move U (Up) to (6, 3)** at turn 64.

The borders are from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid, I think, since walls are at the edges. x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, so playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6)? Let's confirm.\n> \n> Border cells: x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. So the playable grid is from (1,1) to (6,6), I believe. But let's see the snake positions: head at (6,2), which is x=6, y=2. x=6 is not a wall? x=7 is wall, so x=6 should be playable. Similarly, y=2 is playable. Internal obstacle at (1,6), which is within the grid.\n> \n> Playable area: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except walls and obstacles. Walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so cells with x=1 to 6 and y=1 to 6 are free, except where obstacles are. Internal obstacle at (1,6), so that cell is blocked.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (6,2), direction U, so moving up. Current direction is U, so I can move U, L, or R, but not D, because D is opposite to U. Rule: no instant reverse, so from U, I cannot go D. Possible moves: U (same as current), L (left), R (right).\n> \n> Now, let's see the food positions:\n> \n> - (1,2): value 1, life span 4. So it will disappear after turn 64 + 4 - 1? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 64, life span is 4, so it exists for turns 64, 65, 66, 67, and disappears after that, so not available on turn 68. Life span N means it disappears after N turns, so with N=4, it will be gone after turn 67? Let's clarify.\n> \n> Rule: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So for food at (1,2), life span 4 at turn 64. After turn 64, countdown becomes 3, so on turn 65, it has life span 3, and so on. It disappears after N turns, meaning after turn 64 + N, I think. \"Disappears after N turns\" – let's interpret.\n> \n> Typically, if life span is N at turn t, it will last until turn t + N - 1, and disappear at turn t + N. But the rule says \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn including current\".\n> \n> For example, at turn t, life span N. After turn t, it becomes N-1. If N-1 >0, it stays, else disappears. So it disappears when countdown reaches 0.\n> \n> Rule: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" – this might be ambiguous.\n> \n> Let's read carefully: \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> I think it means: at the start, life span is set to N. Each turn, including the current one, the life span decreases by 1. When life span reaches 0, the food disappears at the end of that turn or something.\n> \n> But in the context, for decision, we need to know when it's gone.\n> \n> In the state, it's given with life span, so for (1,2) at turn 64, life span 4, so it has 4 turns left including current. After 4 turns, it disappears.\n> \n> So, it will be present on turns: 64, 65, 66, 67. After turn 67, it disappears (since life span 4, from 64 to 67, 4 turns).\n> \n> Similarly, (4,3) life span 7, so until turn 64+6=70? Let's calculate.\n> \n> Turn 64: life span 4 for (1,2), so after turn 64, life span 3; after turn 65, life span 2; after turn 66, life span 1; after turn 67, life span 0, so it disappears before turn 68. So available from turn 64 to 67 inclusive.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,3) life span 7: available from turn 64 to 70 inclusive (64+6=70, since 7 turns: 64 to 70 is 7 turns).\n> \n> Turn 64: span 7, turn 65:6, ..., turn 70: span 1, after turn 70, span 0, gone.

That's 18 segments. Let me list them in order:\n> \n> 1. Head: (6,3)\n> \n> 2. (6,2)\n> \n> 3. (6,1)\n> \n> 4. (5,1)\n> \n> 5. (4,1)\n> \n> 6. (3,1)\n> \n> 7. (2,1)\n> \n> 8. (2,2)\n> \n> 9.

No negative food here.\n> \n> Life span: for (1,2), it disappears after 3 turns, including current turn? The problem says: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So at turn 65, life_span is 3, meaning it will disappear after 3 more turns? Let me read carefully.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span).

So it can be eaten on turns 65, 66, or 67.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,3): life_span=6, so it lasts until turn 70 (65+6-1?

But the countdown decreases at the end of the turn, I think.\n> \n> The food is present during the turn when life_span > 0.

But in the core rules, positive food is +1, negative is -1. Here it says value1 for (1,2) is 1, which is positive. For (4,3), it says 4,1 – value=4? But the core rules say positive food is +1, negative is -1. There might be a misunderstanding.\n> \n> Look back: \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span: - ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 )\" but in the input, it's given as (x,y, value, life_span) without the inner parentheses. So for (1,2,1,1), it means x=1,y=2, value=1, life_span=1.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,3,4,1) – x=4,y=3, value=4, life_span=1? But value=4? That doesn't match the core rules which say positive food is +1 and negative is -1. Perhaps I misread the core rules.\n> \n> Core rules: \"Positive Food - Reward Value = +1\" and \"Negative Food - Penalty Value = -1\". But here, for (4,3,4,1), value is 4, which is not +1 or -1.

Value 7?\n> \n> And (5,6,10,1) – x=5,y=6, value=10, life_span=1.\n> \n> But core rules say positive food is +1, so perhaps these values are the life spans or something? No, the format says \"value and life span\", so for (1,2,1,1) it's value=1, life_span=1; for (4,3,4,1) value=4, life_span=1; etc.\n> \n> This contradicts the core rules. Core rules state that positive food has value +1 and negative has -1, but here values are given as 1,4,7,10, all positive but different values. I think there might be a mistake in my reading.\n> \n> Let me read the core rules carefully: \"Positive Food - Reward Value = +1 | Length of snake +1\" and \"Negative Food - Penalty Value = -1 | Length of snake unchanged\". But in the state input, for food, it's given with a value, which could be different.\n> \n> Perhaps the value indicates the reward, not necessarily +1 or -1. But the core rules say \"Reward Value = +1\" for positive, so it should be fixed. But here, values are 1,4,7,10, so maybe it's possible to have different reward values? The core rules don't specify that values can vary; it says \"Reward Value = +1\" explicitly.\n> \n> But in the state, it's given with different values, so I should go by the state. Perhaps for this game, food can have different values.\n> \n> Similarly, life span: for all, life_span is 1 except for (4,3,4,1) life_span=1? (4,3,4,1) – value=4, life_span=1; (5,3,7,1) value=7, life_span=1; (5,6,10,1) value=10, life_span=1; and (1,2,1,1) value=1, life_span=1. All have life_span=1, meaning they disappear after this turn if not eaten.\n> \n> Life span decreases every turn, including current, so if life span is 1, after this turn, it disappears if not eaten.\n> \n> But for (4,3,4,1), value=4, which is higher than 1, so perhaps in this game, food can have different values. I think I should accept the state as given, so there are foods with values 1,4,7,10, all positive since values are positive, and life span 1 for all, so they must be eaten this turn or they vanish.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (6,5), direction U, so moving up would go to (6,6). But y=6 is a border wall, since y=7 is wall, but y=6 is not wall, walls are x=0,x=7,y=0,y=7, so the grid cells are from (1,1) to (6,6), since x=0 and x=7 are walls, y=0 and y=7 are walls, so playable area (1,1) to (6,6).\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (1,6), so (1,6) is blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions: let's list them to understand the shape.\n> \n> Head: (6,5)\n> \n> Then: (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1) — so a vertical line down to (6,1)\n> \n> Then (5,1) — so turns left\n> \n> Then (4,1), (3,1), (2,1) — horizontal left to (2,1)\n> \n> Then (2,2) — up to y=2\n> \n> Then (3,2) — right to x=3\n> \n> Then (4,2) — right to x=4\n> \n> Then (4,3) — up to y=3\n> \n> Then (4,4) — up to y=4\n> \n> Then (4,5) — up to y=5\n> \n> Then (3,5) — left to x=3\n> \n> Then (3,6) — up to y=6\n> \n> Then (4,6) — right to x=4\n> \n> And tail at (4,6)\n> \n> Now, food at:\n> \n> - (1,2): value 1, life span 1\n> \n> - (4,3): value 4, life span 1\n> \n> - (5,3): value 7, life span 1\n> \n> - (5,6): value 10, life span 1\n> \n> All life span 1, so if not eaten this turn, they disappear.\n> \n> Head at (6,5), direction U, so possible moves: U, L, R?

Snake positions: (3,6) and (4,6) are at y=6, but x=3 and 4, not 6. (6,6) is not in snake positions, so should be free? But let's list all snake positions to check.\n> \n> Snake: (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6)\n> \n> So (6,6) is not occupied by snake or wall, and no obstacle, so U to (6,6) is possible.\n> \n> Left (L): (5,5) — x=5,y=5. Is this occupied? Snake has (4,5) at (4,5), (3,5) at (3,5), but not (5,5). Walls: no. So (5,5) should be free.\n> \n> Right (R): but x=6 is current, right would be x=7, which is wall, since x=7 is border. So cannot go R.\n> \n> Down (D): but current direction U, so reverse to D is not allowed, and also, (6,4) is the body segment right behind, so moving down would cause collision immediately, but according to rules, moving into the tail segment might be ok if the tail moves, but let's see.\n> \n> Rules: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\" But in this case, if head moves down to (6,4), which is currently occupied by the first body segment, and after move, the tail moves away, so (6,4) becomes the new head position, and the tail segment moves off, so it might be safe if that cell was only tail and not other body.\n> \n> Specifically, for collision: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, if the head moves to a cell that is currently occupied by the tail segment, and after the move, the tail moves, so that cell is no longer occupied, and head is there, but since tail moved, it's ok. But if it's a body segment other than tail, it will still be there after move, so collision.\n> \n> In this case, head at (6,5), moving down to (6,4). Currently, (6,4) is occupied by the second segment. After move: head moves to (6,4), and the tail moves off its position. But the segment at (6,4) was not the tail; the tail is at (4,6). So when head moves to (6,4), which was occupied by a body segment, after the move, that body segment is still part of the snake, but it has moved? Let's think about how snake moves.\n> \n> When snake moves, the head goes to a new cell, and each segment moves to the next position, so the segment that was at position i moves to position i-1 or something. Standard snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, the tail end is removed, and if food eaten, tail not removed, so snake grows.\n> \n> Specifically, in terms of positions: if no food eaten, head moves to new cell, body segments follow, so the last segment (tail) is removed. If food eaten, head moves to food cell, and tail does not move, so snake grows by one.\n> \n> For collision: during the move, if the new head position is occupied by a body segment, it's collision, except if it's the current tail position and no food is eaten there, because after move, the tail moves away.\n> \n> The rule says: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> But only if that cell is the tail segment. In this case, for move down to (6,4), (6,4) is not the tail; tail is at (4,6). So (6,4) is a body segment, and after move, if no food, the segment that was at (6,4) will move to (6,3) or something, but the cell (6,4) will be occupied by the new head position, but the body segment that was there has moved, so it's not occupied anymore? I'm confusing myself.\n> \n> Let me clarify with positions.\n> \n> Current positions: let's index them. Head: pos[0] = (6,5)\n> \n> pos[1] = (6,4)\n> \n> pos[2] = (6,3)\n> \n> ...\n> \n> up to pos[17] = (4,6) tail.\n> \n> If head moves down to (6,4), and no food eaten at (6,4), then new head position is (6,4), and the body: segment 1 moves to where head was, but since head moved down, the new position for segment 1 is (6,5), and segment 2 moves to (6,4)? No.\n> \n> Standard: after move, the new head is at the new position, then each subsequent segment moves to the previous position of the segment before it. So if head moves to a new cell, say new_head, then position 0 becomes new_head, position 1 becomes old pos[0], position 2 becomes old pos[1], and so on, up to the tail, old pos[n-1] becomes new pos[n], but since no growth, the last position is discarded.\n> \n> Specifically, for a snake of length L, positions P0 to P_{L-1}, P0 head.\n> \n> After moving to a new cell Q:\n> \n> - If no food, new positions: Q, P0, P1, ..., P_{L-2}  (so P_{L-1} is removed)\n> \n> - If food at Q, new positions: Q, P0, P1, ..., P_{L-1}  (snake grows)\n> \n> Collision occurs if Q is a wall, or if Q is occupied by any of the current body segments P1 to P_{L-1}, except that if Q is P_{L-1} (current tail) and no food eaten, then it might be ok because after move, P_{L-1} is removed, so Q is not occupied anymore.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, if Q = P_{L-1}, and no food, then after move, the tail moves, so no collision. If Q = P_{L-1} and food eaten, then since snake grows, tail doesn't move, so head and tail are at same cell, collision.\n> \n> Also, if Q is any other body segment, like P1 to P_{L-2}, it's always collision because after move, that segment is still there or moved, but the cell might be occupied.\n> \n> For example, if head moves to a cell that is currently P_i for i=1 to L-2, after move, that cell will be occupied by the new head or by another segment? After move, the cell that was P_i will be occupied by the segment that was P_{i-1} or something.\n> \n> To avoid confusion, the key point is: before move, if the target cell Q is occupied by any segment except the tail, it's deadly. If it is the tail and no food, it's safe; if tail and food, deadly because of collision after growth.\n> \n> Also, if Q is not occupied now, but after move it might be, but since we move first, it should be fine.\n> \n> In this case, for head at (6,5), moving down to (6,4):\n> \n> Current occupants: (6,4) is pos[1], which is a body segment, not tail. Tail is at (4,6). So since (6,4) is not tail, moving there would cause collision with body segment, even after move, because the segment that was at (6,4) will move to (6,3) or something, but during the move, when head enters (6,4), it is occupied by a body segment, so collision.\n> \n> Similarly, if moving to a cell with food under snake, it can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves there, but in this case, (6,4) has no food, I think.\n> \n> Food positions are (1,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,6); (6,4) has no food, so moving to (6,4) is invalid because it's occupied by body.\n> \n> Therefore, from (6,5), possible moves:\n> \n> - U: to (6,6)\n> \n> - L: to (5,5)\n> \n> - R: to (7,5) but x=7 is wall, impossible\n> \n> - D: to (6,4) but occupied by body, and not tail, so deadly, impossible.\n> \n> So only possible moves this turn: U or L.\n> \n> Now, U to (6,6): is (6,6) safe? (6,6) is within bounds, not wall, and not occupied by snake or obstacle. Snake has (3,6) and (4,6), but not (6,6). So moving U to (6,6) is safe.\n> \n> L to (5,5): (5,5) is free, no snake or wall, so safe.\n> \n> Now, after moving, if we eat food, but no food at (6,6) or (5,5), so snake doesn't grow.\n> \n> Food is at (1,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,6). (5,6) is at x=5,y=6.\n> \n> If we move U to (6,6), no food there. Move L to (5,5), no food.\n> \n> But we need to think ahead for multiple turns.\n> \n> All food has life span 1, so they disappear after this turn if not eaten. So we must eat one of them this turn to get the reward, or lose them.\n> \n> But head is at (6,5), food at (1,2) far away, (4,3) is occupied by snake? (4,3) is in snake positions: from list, (4,3) is a body segment.\n> \n> Food at (4,3) with value 4, but (4,3) is currently occupied by snake body, specifically, it's position 12 in the list: positions are (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6)\n> \n> So (4,3) is the 13th segment? Index from 0: head (6,5)=0, (6,4)=1, (6,3)=2, (6,2)=3, (6,1)=4, (5,1)=5, (4,1)=6, (3,1)=7, (2,1)=8, (2,2)=9, (3,2)=10, (4,2)=11, (4,3)=12, (4,4)=13, (4,5)=14, (3,5)=15, (3,6)=16, (4,6)=17 tail.\n> \n> So (4,3) is occupied by segment 12, not tail.\n> \n> Food at (4,3) can be eaten only if the snake moves so that the body moves away from (4,3) and then head moves onto it. But this turn, since life span is 1, it must be eaten this turn or lost.\n> \n> Similarly for (5,3): food at (5,3), value 7, life span 1. Is (5,3) occupied? Snake positions: not listed, so not occupied, so it can be eaten if head moves there.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,6): (5,6), value 10, not occupied, can be eaten.\n> \n> (1,2): (1,2), value 1, not occupied? Snake has (2,2) at (2,2), and (3,2), but not (1,2), so free.\n> \n> But (1,2) is far from head at (6,5), impossible to reach in one turn.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,3) is occupied, and to eat it, we need to move the body away, but that takes multiple turns.\n> \n> For food under snake body, it can be eaten only when the snake moves such that the body is no longer there and head moves in.\n> \n> But with life span 1, for (4,3), since it's occupied and life span 1, it will disappear after this turn without being eaten, because the body is there and head can't reach it this turn.\n> \n> Similarly for others.\n> \n> Food at (4,3) is on a body segment, so unless that segment moves away this turn, but the segment at (4,3) will move only if the snake moves and that position is vacated, but in one move, only the tail might move if no growth.\n> \n> For example, if snake moves and no food eaten, the tail moves away from its position. But for (4,3), it's not the tail; it's in the middle. So after a move, the segment at (4,3) will move to a new position based on the movement.\n> \n> But the food at (4,3) is on the cell, so if the segment moves away, the food becomes accessible, but only if head can move there immediately, which may not be possible.\n> \n> With life span 1, since after this turn, the food disappears, and currently (4,3) is occupied, so unless this turn we move such that the body leaves (4,3) and head enters it, but that's impossible because the body leaves only if the snake moves, and after move, the head is at a new position, so (4,3) might be vacated or not.\n> \n> Let's simulate.\n> \n> Suppose at turn 67, we make a move. After the move, the food life span decreases, so if not eaten, it vanishes.\n> \n> For cell (4,3), it is occupied by snake, so food there cannot be eaten because head can't move to an occupied cell. Only when the snake moves away, but after move, if the segment leaves (4,3), then (4,3) is free, but head is not there, and food is still there only if life span >0, but with life span 1, after this turn, it decreases to 0 and disappears.\n> \n> Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at the start of turn, life span is given, then after the turn, if not eaten, it decreases.\n> \n> The rule: \"Life-span - Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) - Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So for food with life_span=1, at turn 67, it has life_span=1. After turn 67, if not eaten, life_span becomes 0 and it disappears.\n> \n> During turn 67, if head moves to that cell, it is eaten.\n> \n> But for (4,3), the cell is occupied by body, so head cannot move to it because it's not free. So it cannot be eaten this turn, and after turn, it disappears.\n> \n> Similarly for any food under body with life span 1, it cannot be eaten and will be lost.\n> \n> Therefore, for this state, food at (4,3) cannot be eaten because it's under snake body and life span 1, so it will disappear without being eaten.\n> \n> Food at (1,2) is free but too far.\n> \n> Food at (5,3) is free, at (5,3)\n> \n> Food at (5,6) is free, at (5,6)\n> \n> Head at (6,5), so (5,3) is at (5,3), which is left and down from (6,5)? (6,5) to (5,3): x-1, y-2, so not adjacent.\n> \n> Adjacent cells: (6,5) has neighbors: (6,6) U, (5,5) L, (6,4) D (invalid), (7,5) R (wall)\n> \n> (5,3) is not adjacent; it's two steps away.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,6) is at (5,6), which is adjacent? (6,5) to (5,6): that's diagonal, not adjacent in grid; adjacent means same row or column, differ by 1 in x or y but not both.\n> \n> So (5,6) is left and up: x=5, y=6, while head at (6,5), so |dx|=1, |dy|=1, so not adjacent; it's diagonal, not reachable in one move.\n> \n> From (6,5), possible moves only to (6,6) or (5,5), as we have.\n> \n> (5,5) is one step left to (5,5), then from there, we can go to (5,6) or other places.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,3) is down and left, but not directly accessible.\n> \n> Since all food must be eaten this turn or lost, but the only food we can reach this turn is none, because no food at (6,6) or (5,5), and other food are not adjacent or occupied.\n> \n> (5,3) is at (5,3), not adjacent to head. (5,6) at (5,6), not adjacent. (1,2) far, (4,3) occupied.\n> \n> So, no food can be eaten this turn; all will disappear after this turn.\n> \n> Therefore, for turn 67, we cannot eat any food, so we just need to move safely and plan for future, but since no food now, we need to survive and wait for new food or something.\n> \n> But the game might spawn new food later, but in this state, no information about future food, so we have to assume that food will appear, or we need to explore.\n> \n> But for now, with current food, all disappear after this turn.\n> \n> So for turn 67, we move either U to (6,6) or L to (5,5).\n> \n> Then after that, the board has no food, until new food spawns, but we don't know when.\n> \n> The problem is to maximize score, so we need to eat food when possible.\n> \n> But here, no food can be eaten this turn.\n> \n> Now, we need to think 5+ turns ahead for survival.\n> \n> First, let's list the current snake positions to understand the space.\n> \n> Grid: 6x6, from (1,1) to (6,6), with wall borders and obstacle at (1,6).\n> \n> Snake occupies 18 cells, so free cells: total cells 6x6=36, minus walls?

The body moves away, and 2.

It's turn 69, and the grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So coordinates from (0,0) to (7,7), with (0,0) being bottom-left or top-left? Typically in grids, (0,0) is top-left, but in this case, y=0 is a border, and snake positions have y decreasing, so let's confirm.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (5,6), then (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), down to (3,6). Since y=0 is a wall, and positions like (6,1), (5,1), etc., y values decrease as we go down, so probably (0,0) is bottom-left? But in standard grid notation, it might be top-left. I need to be careful.\n> \n> Looking at the positions: head at (5,6), then (5,5), which is down if y increases up, or up if y increases down. Head direction is U, which is (x,y+1), so U increases y, meaning y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top? Let's see the movement.\n> \n> Snake head direction is U, so moving up. From (5,6) moving U would go to (5,7), but y=7 is a wall, so that would be invalid. But in the positions, (5,6) to (5,5) is down, but direction is U? That doesn't match.\n> \n> Current head position is (5,6), and direction is U. But the previous position is (5,5), so if head was at (5,5) and moved U to (5,6), that makes sense. So from (5,5) to (5,6) is U, so y increases as we go up. So (0,0) is bottom-left, (7,7) top-right? x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n> \n> y=0 is bottom, y=7 top. x=0 left, x=7 right.\n> \n> Walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are borders. Also internal obstacle at (1,6).\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (5,6), body segments: (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (3,6). That's 19 segments? Let's count: positions list has 19 elements, so snake length is 19.\n> \n> Food:\n> \n> - (4,3) with value 1, life_span 3? Food format: (x,y, life_span, value) I think. From input: \"(4, 3, 3, 1)\" and \"(5, 3, 5, 1)\", so (x,y, life_span, value). Value is 1 for both, so positive food. Life span: for (4,3) is 3, meaning it disappears after 3 turns including current, so at turn 72 it will be gone if not eaten. Similarly, (5,3) life span 5, disappears at turn 74.\n> \n> Current turn is 69, so for (4,3): life_span 3, so it will be there for turns 69,70,71, gone at 72.\n> \n> For (5,3): life_span 5, there for turns 69,70,71,72,73, gone at 74.\n> \n> Both have value +1, so positive food.\n> \n> Now, I need to choose a sequence of actions for the next few turns, thinking at least 5 turns ahead.\n> \n> First, where is the snake head?

But when head moves, the tail moves, so the cell that was tail is vacated, but other body segments remain.\n> \n> Specifically, if head moves to a cell occupied by a body segment that is not the tail, it's a collision because that segment doesn't move until the head moves and the snake grows or not.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, if it doesn't eat food, tail moves away, so all body segments shift, so the cell that was body is now vacated except for the new head position.\n> \n> But collision happens if head moves into a cell that is or will be occupied by a body segment at that turn.\n> \n> Rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment).\"\n> \n> And the exception: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, if head moves to the current tail position, it's ok because tail moves away, so no collision.

So moving to (5,5) would collide with body segment there.\n> \n> Similarly, move L: (4,6). Is (4,6) occupied? Snake positions: (5,6), (5,5), (6,5), etc. (4,6) not in list, so probably free? But need to check walls and obstacles.\n> \n> Walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. (4,6) x=4 between 0-7, y=6 between 0-7, not border. Internal obstacles: only (1,6), so (4,6) should be free.\n> \n> But is there food? Food at (4,3) and (5,3), not (4,6).\n> \n> Move R: (6,6). Is (6,6) occupied? Snake: (5,6), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), etc. (6,6) not listed, so free? Walls: x=6<7, y=6<7, not wall. Obstacle at (1,6), not (6,6). So should be free.\n> \n> But move U is invalid because (5,7) is wall.\n> \n> Move D is invalid because (5,5) is body and not tail.\n> \n> So possible moves: L to (4,6) or R to (6,6).\n> \n> Now, head direction is U, so moving L or R is fine, not opposite.\n> \n> I need to think ahead for multiple turns.\n> \n> Food available: (4,3) and (5,3).\n> \n> (4,3) has life_span 3, so must be eaten by turn 71 (since disappears after turn 71?

Snake positions include (4,3)? Positions: ... (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), ... yes, (4,3) is a body segment.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,3) is not in snake positions, so it's free.\n> \n> Food at (4,3) and (5,3).\n> \n> (4,3) is currently under snake body, since it's occupied by a segment.\n> \n> Rule: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1.

So when the snake moves, if it doesn't eat food, the tail moves, but other segments shift forward.\n> \n> Specifically, when the snake moves without eating, the head moves to a new position, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment in front, and the tail is removed.\n> \n> So for (4,3) to be vacated, the segment that was there must move to a new position.\n> \n> Currently, segment 13 is at (4,2), segment 14 at (4,3), segment 15 at (4,4).\n> \n> If the snake moves down or something, segment 14 will move to where segment 13 was or something. Let's simulate movement.\n> \n> Suppose the snake moves in a certain direction, and since no food is eaten, the tail moves away.\n> \n> But to vacate (4,3), we need segment 14 to leave that cell.\n> \n> Segment 14 will move to the position that segment 13 was at before the move, but segment 13 is at (4,2), which is adjacent.\n> \n> Depending on the movement, the body segments shift.\n> \n> For example, if the head moves left to (4,6), then new head at (4,6), segment 1 moves to old head position (5,6), segment 2 to (5,5), and so on, down to segment 14: previously at (4,3), but now it moves to where segment 13 was, which is (4,2)? Segment 13 is at (4,2), but after head moves, segment 13 moves to where segment 12 was? Let's think carefully.\n> \n> After a move without eating:\n> \n> - New head position: where head moved to\n> \n> - Segment 1 (new neck) moves to old head position\n> \n> - Segment 2 moves to old position of segment 1\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - Segment k moves to old position of segment k-1 for k from 1 to len-1, but segment 0 is head, so after move, new segment 1 is old segment 0 position? Standard: positions shift.\n> \n> Better to think of the positions list.\n> \n> Current positions: [ (5,6), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (3,6) ]\n> \n> If head moves left to (4,6):\n> \n> New head at (4,6)\n> \n> Then segment 1 (old (5,5)) moves to old head position (5,6)? No.\n> \n> When head moves to a new cell, and no food eaten, the tail is removed, and each segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> So new positions: head at new position, then the old head position becomes the new segment 1, old segment 1 position becomes new segment 2, ..., up to old segment n-2 becomes new segment n-1, and the tail (old segment n-1) is removed.\n> \n> In this case, snake has 19 segments, indices 0 to 18.\n> \n> After moving without eating:\n> \n> - New segment 0: the new head position, say (4,6)\n> \n> - New segment 1: old segment 0 position, (5,6)\n> \n> - New segment 2: old segment 1 position, (5,5)\n> \n> - New segment 3: old segment 2 position, (6,5)\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - New segment 18: old segment 17 position, (3,5)  since old segment 17 is (3,5), old segment 18 is tail at (3,6) which is removed.\n> \n> Old segment 17 is (3,5), which becomes new segment 18?

When no food, head moves to new cell, tail moves away, so the cell that was tail is vacated, but the snake occupies the new head position and all previous positions except the tail is removed, so net same number of segments.\n> \n> In terms of positions: for a snake of length L, after moving without eating, it has L segments, with new head, and the tail cell is free.\n> \n> Specifically, the new body consists of the old head position, and old positions 1 to L-2, but not the old tail.\n> \n> For example, current positions: H, B1, B2, ..., B_{L-2}, T\n> \n> After move, new head at new cell, new B1 at old H, new B2 at old B1, ..., new T at old B_{L-2}, and old T is removed.\n> \n> In this case, L=19, positions: 0:H, 1:B1, 2:B2, ..., 17:B17, 18:T\n> \n> After move without eating:\n> \n> New 0: new head\n> \n> New 1: old 0 (H)\n> \n> New 2: old 1 (B1)\n> \n> ...\n> \n> New 18: old 17 (B17)\n> \n> Old 18 (T) is removed.\n> \n> So the cell that was T is now free.\n> \n> Other body cells are still occupied, but by different segments.\n> \n> For cell (4,3), it is currently occupied by segment 14 (which is B14 or something).\n> \n> Old position 14: (4,3)\n> \n> After a move, if no change, new position 15 will be old position 14, but let's see.\n> \n> Back to (4,3): to vacate it, the segment that is there must move away, which happens when the snake moves, and that segment shifts to a new position.\n> \n> Specifically, segment at (4,3) is old pos[14].\n> \n> After a move, new pos[15] = old pos[14], so the segment moves to a new cell, thus (4,3) is vacated only if no segment is assigned to it, which happens when the snake moves and that position is not the new position for any segment.\n> \n> In the new positions, new pos[k] = old pos[k-1] for k>=1, so old pos[m] becomes new pos[m+1], which is a different cell if the snake moved.\n> \n> The cell (4,3) is vacated if, after the move, no segment is at (4,3), which means that the segment that was there has moved, and no other segment moves to it.\n> \n> Since new positions are based on old positions shifted, (4,3) will be vacated after any move, because the segment that was there will be at a new position in the new state.\n> \n> For example, if head moves left to (4,6), then new positions:\n> \n> New 0: (4,6)  new head\n> \n> New 1: old 0 = (5,6)\n> \n> New 2: old 1 = (5,5)\n> \n> New 3: old 2 = (6,5)\n> \n> New 4: old 3 = (6,4)\n> \n> New 5: old 4 = (6,3)\n> \n> New 6: old 5 = (6,2)\n> \n> New 7: old 6 = (6,1)\n> \n> New 8: old 7 = (5,1)\n> \n> New 9: old 8 = (4,1)\n> \n> New 10: old 9 = (3,1)\n> \n> New 11: old 10 = (2,1)\n> \n> New 12: old 11 = (2,2)\n> \n> New 13: old 12 = (3,2)\n> \n> New 14: old 13 = (4,2)  // old pos[13] was (4,2)\n> \n> New 15: old 14 = (4,3)  // so new pos[15] is at (4,3), still occupied\n> \n> New 16: old 15 = (4,4)\n> \n> New 17: old 16 = (4,5)\n> \n> New 18: old 17 = (3,5)  // new tail at (3,5), old tail (3,6) removed\n> \n> So after moving to (4,6), the cell (4,3) is still occupied by new segment 15, which is the same segment that was there before.\n> \n> The segment moved, but to a different cell?

Because new pos[15] = old pos[14] = (4,3), so it didn't move; the position is the same.\n> \n> Why? Because the snake moved, but the body segments only shift if the head moves in a way that changes the path, but in this case, since the head moved left, and the body was not moving in that direction, the positions change.\n> \n> In this specific move, the segment at (4,3) was old pos[14], and after move, new pos[15] = old pos[14] = (4,3), so it is still at (4,3). Similarly, for example, old pos[13] was (4,2), new pos[14] = old pos[13] = (4,2), so (4,2) is still occupied.\n> \n> Only the tail changed: old tail at (3,6) removed, new tail at (3,5).\n> \n> But for cells like (5,6), which was head, now occupied by new segment 1.\n> \n> So in this case, (4,3) is still occupied after the move.\n> \n> To vacate (4,3), we need the snake to move in such a way that the segment that is there moves away and no other segment moves to it.\n> \n> For example, if the snake moves down or something, but let's see the configuration.\n> \n> The snake has a bend; from (4,2) to (4,3) to (4,4), so it's a straight vertical segment at x=4, y from 2 to 4 or something.\n> \n> Positions: (4,2), (4,3), (4,4) are consecutive segments, so it's a straight line vertical, so if the head moves, but since it's straight, the segments may not move relative to each other if the movement is perpendicular.\n> \n> To vacate (4,3), we need the snake to turn so that the segment at (4,3) moves to a different cell.\n> \n> For example, if the head moves in a way that causes the body to turn at (4,3).\n> \n> But currently, the head is at (5,6), far away.\n> \n> The food at (4,3) has limited time, life_span 3, so at turn 69, it has 3 turns left, including turn 69.

Also, moving to a body segment is deadly except for the tail, but only if the tail moves away.\n> \n> From (4,6):\n> \n> - U: (4,7) – y=7 is wall, invalid.\n> \n> - D: (4,5) – occupied by snake body at (4,5), which is not the tail; tail is at (3,5). So moving to (4,5) would collide with body.\n> \n> - L: (3,6) – not occupied, not wall, should be valid.\n> \n> - R: (5,6) – occupied by snake body at (5,6), and also R is opposite to L, so invalid due to instant reverse and collision.\n> \n> So only possible move is L to (3,6).\n> \n> But I need to think multiple turns ahead. Also, food is at (4,3), (5,3), (3,2).\n> \n> Life spans: (4,3) has life span 2, meaning it disappears after 2 turns including current, so at turn 71 or 72? Life span decreases every turn, including current turn.\n> \n> Current turn is 70, so for food at (4,3) with life span 2: on turn 70, life span 2; after turn 70, it becomes 1; after turn 71, it becomes 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten on turn 70 or 71, but not after.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,3) life span 4: on turn 70, life=4; turn 71, life=3; turn 72, life=2; turn 73, life=1; turn 74, life=0, disappears. So can be eaten turns 70 to 73.\n> \n> (3,2) life span 10: lasts until turn 79 or so.\n> \n> Now, the snake is at (4,6), moving left to (3,6) seems necessary for this turn since it's the only move.\n> \n> But let's confirm the grid.\n> \n> I should list free cells or something.\n> \n> First, let's find where the snake is not.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n> \n> Walls: all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls.

Position (4,3) is part of snake body, and there is food there? But food can be under the body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves onto it.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,2) has food, and (3,2) is also a body segment? Positions: (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), etc. (3,2) is occupied by snake body.\n> \n> (5,3) has food, is it occupied? (5,3) not in snake positions, so it should be free with food.\n> \n> Let's list food positions:\n> \n> - Food at (4,3): but (4,3) is occupied by snake body segment. From positions: (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), so (4,3) is the 16th segment or something. So food is under the body.\n> \n> - Food at (5,3): (5,3) not in snake positions, so it's free with food.\n> \n> - Food at (3,2): (3,2) is occupied, as it's in positions: (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), so food under body.\n> \n> So only (5,3) is currently accessible, but the snake is far from it.\n> \n> Now, current head at (4,6), moving to (3,6) is the only option this turn.\n> \n> After moving to (3,6), the snake head is at (3,6), and direction is now L, since we moved left.\n> \n> Then on next turn, possible moves from (3,6):\n> \n> - U: (3,7) but y=7 wall, invalid\n> \n> - D: (3,5) – (3,5) is the tail segment. But tail will move when we move, so it might be safe if we move onto tail position.\n> \n> - L: (2,6) – need to check if valid\n> \n> - R: (4,6) – but (4,6) was head, now after move, the body will shift, but let's think carefully.\n> \n> After moving head to (3,6), the new positions: head at (3,6), then the previous head (4,6) becomes body, so positions: [(3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), ... and tail at (3,5) will be removed if no food eaten, but since we didn't eat, length same, so tail moves forward.\n> \n> When snake moves without eating, head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, and the tail is removed.\n> \n> So from current: head (4,6) moves to (3,6), so new head (3,6).\n> \n> Then the first body segment (5,6) moves to where head was, (4,6).\n> \n> Then (5,5) moves to (5,6)? Let's sequence.\n> \n> Old positions: index 0: head (4,6), 1: (5,6), 2: (5,5), 3: (6,5), 4: (6,4), 5: (6,3), 6: (6,2), 7: (6,1), 8: (5,1), 9: (4,1), 10: (3,1), 11: (2,1), 12: (2,2), 13: (3,2), 14: (4,2), 15: (4,3), 16: (4,4), 17: (4,5), 18: tail (3,5)\n> \n> After move left to (3,6):\n> \n> New head: (3,6)\n> \n> Then new body: segment 1 moves to old head (4,6)\n> \n> Segment 2 moves to segment 1's old position (5,6)\n> \n> Segment 3 moves to segment 2's old (5,5)\n> \n> Segment 4 to (6,5)\n> \n> Segment 5 to (6,4)\n> \n> Segment 6 to (6,3)\n> \n> Segment 7 to (6,2)\n> \n> Segment 8 to (6,1)\n> \n> Segment 9 to (5,1)\n> \n> Segment 10 to (4,1)\n> \n> Segment 11 to (3,1)\n> \n> Segment 12 to (2,1)\n> \n> Segment 13 to (2,2)\n> \n> Segment 14 to (3,2)\n> \n> Segment 15 to (4,2)\n> \n> Segment 16 to (4,3)\n> \n> Segment 17 to (4,4)\n> \n> Segment 18 to (4,5)\n> \n> But tail was (3,5), and since no food eaten, the tail is removed, so the last segment is gone. New tail is the previous segment 17, which was at (4,5), now moves to where? Segment 17 was at (4,5), but in the new body, segment 17 is the new segment 17, which was segment 16 old, at (4,3) old, now moved to (4,4)? I'm confusing myself.\n> \n> Better to think: the head moves to new position. Each subsequent segment moves to the position of the previous segment in the list.\n> \n> So new positions:\n> \n> - New head: (3,6)  // moved to left\n> \n> - New pos 1: old head (4,6)\n> \n> - New pos 2: old pos 1 (5,6)\n> \n> - New pos 3: old pos 2 (5,5)\n> \n> - New pos 4: old pos 3 (6,5)\n> \n> - New pos 5: old pos 4 (6,4)\n> \n> - New pos 6: old pos 5 (6,3)\n> \n> - New pos 7: old pos 6 (6,2)\n> \n> - New pos 8: old pos 7 (6,1)\n> \n> - New pos 9: old pos 8 (5,1)\n> \n> - New pos 10: old pos 9 (4,1)\n> \n> - New pos 11: old pos 10 (3,1)\n> \n> - New pos 12: old pos 11 (2,1)\n> \n> - New pos 13: old pos 12 (2,2)\n> \n> - New pos 14: old pos 13 (3,2)\n> \n> - New pos 15: old pos 14 (4,2)\n> \n> - New pos 16: old pos 15 (4,3)\n> \n> - New pos 17: old pos 16 (4,4)\n> \n> - New pos 18: old pos 17 (4,5)  // this is the new tail, since tail was old pos 18 (3,5) and not included.\n> \n> Old tail was (3,5), which is not part of new snake. So new snake has 18 segments? No, length unchanged, so 19 segments but tail removed.\n> \n> Old snake had 19 positions, after move without eating, new snake has head at new position, and body from old head to old second last, so 18 segments? Let's count.\n> \n> Old positions: 19 positions, index 0 to 18.\n> \n> After move: new head at (3,6)\n> \n> Then new body: positions 1 to 18 of old, but each shifted: new position i for i=1 to 18 is old position i-1.\n> \n> Standard: new position 0: head new position\n> \n> New position 1: old position 0\n> \n> New position 2: old position 1\n> \n> ...\n> \n> New position k: old position k-1 for k from 1 to 18\n> \n> But old position 18 was tail, so new snake has positions from new 0 to new 18, but new 18 is old position 17, which was (4,5), and old position 18 is not included.\n> \n> Number of segments: since no food, length same, so new snake has one less segment? No.\n> \n> Initial snake has n segments. When it moves without eating, the head moves to a new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, and the tail position is vacated. So the snake still has n segments, but the tail is now at what was the second last position.\n> \n> For example, simple case: snake at [(1,1), (1,2)] head at (1,1), body at (1,2). Move left to (0,1). New head (0,1), new body at old head (1,1). Tail (1,2) is removed. So new snake [(0,1), (1,1)] with 2 segments.\n> \n> Similarly here, old snake 19 segments. After move, new head (3,6), then new segment 1: old head (4,6), new segment 2: old segment 1 (5,6), ..., up to new segment 18: old segment 17 (4,5), and old segment 18 (3,5) is removed. So new snake has 18 segments? But that can't be right because length should be unchanged unless eating.\n> \n> I think I have a mistake.\n> \n> Snake length: when it doesn't eat, the length remains the same, but the tail moves forward, so the snake occupies the same number of cells, but shifted.\n> \n> In terms of positions, the head moves to a new cell, and the tail cell is abandoned, so the snake occupies a new set of cells with the same count.\n> \n> In the list, the number of positions is the same, but the values change.\n> \n> For this snake: 19 positions. After moving head to (3,6), the new position list is:\n> \n> - Head: (3,6)\n> \n> - Body: the first body segment is the old head position (4,6)\n> \n> - Second body segment is old first body position (5,6)\n> \n> - Third: old second body (5,5)\n> \n> - Fourth: old third body (6,5)\n> \n> - Fifth: old fourth body (6,4)\n> \n> - Sixth: old fifth body (6,3)\n> \n> - Seventh: old sixth body (6,2)\n> \n> - Eighth: old seventh body (6,1)\n> \n> - Ninth: old eighth body (5,1)\n> \n> - Tenth: old ninth body (4,1)\n> \n> - Eleventh: old tenth body (3,1)\n> \n> - Twelfth: old eleventh body (2,1)\n> \n> - Thirteenth: old twelfth body (2,2)\n> \n> - Fourteenth: old thirteenth body (3,2)\n> \n> - Fifteenth: old fourteenth body (4,2)\n> \n> - Sixteenth: old fifteenth body (4,3)\n> \n> - Seventeenth: old sixteenth body (4,4)\n> \n> - Eighteenth: old seventeenth body (4,5)\n> \n> And the old eighteenth position (3,5) is no longer occupied, so it's free now.\n> \n> But the new snake has 19 positions? Head + 18 body segments? No, head is position 0, then body segments 1 to 18, so 19 positions.\n> \n> New positions: index 0: (3,6), 1: (4,6), 2: (5,6), 3: (5,5), 4: (6,5), 5: (6,4), 6: (6,3), 7: (6,2), 8: (6,1), 9: (5,1), 10: (4,1), 11: (3,1), 12: (2,1), 13: (2,2), 14: (3,2), 15: (4,2), 16: (4,3), 17: (4,4), 18: (4,5)\n> \n> So tail is at (4,5).\n> \n> And (3,5) is now free.\n> \n> Food at (4,3) is still under the body, at position 16: (4,3).\n> \n> Similarly, food at (3,2) is at position 14: (3,2).\n> \n> Food at (5,3) is free.\n> \n> Back to turn 70: only move is L to (3,6).\n> \n> Then on turn 71, head at (3,6), direction L (since we moved left).\n> \n> Possible moves:\n> \n> - U: (3,7) y=7 wall, invalid\n> \n> - D: (3,5) – but (3,5) is now free, as we just vacated it.

So can be eaten on turn 70 or 71. But turn 70 we are moving to (3,6), not eating. On turn 71, if we move to a position to eat it, but (4,3) is under the body, so we can only eat it if the body moves away and head moves there.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,3) life span 4: on turn 70 life=4, so after turn 73 it disappears, can be eaten turns 70 to 73.\n> \n> (3,2) life span 10, plenty of time.\n> \n> But (4,3) must be eaten soon or it disappears.\n> \n> To eat (4,3), which is at (4,3), currently occupied by body at position 16.\n> \n> For the head to eat it, the body must move away from (4,3), and then head moves to (4,3).\n> \n> Currently, after turn 70 move, (4,3) is occupied by segment 16.\n> \n> When will it move away?

(3,6) to (4,3) is not adjacent, so impossible to eat on turn 71.

Cannot move U (up) due to no instant reverse.\n- **Food**:\n  - (5,3): value +1, life span 3 (disappears after Turn 74).\n  - (3,2): value +1, life span 8 (disappears after Turn 79). Currently under the snake's body (segment at index 15).\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **Food at (5,3)**:\n   - Cannot be reached by Turn 74 (as calculated, requires at least 4 moves, but only 3 moves possible by Turn 74).\n   - Ignore this food as it's impossible to eat in time.\n\n2. **Food at (3,2)**:\n   - Currently under the snake's body (segment at index 15).\n   - Will become free after Turn 75 (as the tail moves away).\n   - Can be eaten on Turn 76 if the head is adjacent to (3,2) on Turn 75.\n\n3. **Immediate Move (Turn 72)**:\n   - Goal: Position the snake to be near (3,2) by Turn 75.\n   - Move options:\n     - **D (down to (3,4))**: Starts moving towards the lower area where (3,2) is.\n     - **L (left to (2,5))**: Moves away from (3,2), not optimal.\n     - **R (right to (4,5))**: Moves towards the right side, not directly helpful for (3,2).\n\n   - Best immediate move is **D (down to (3,4))**, as it starts the process of positioning the snake to eventually eat the food at (3,2) on Turn 76.\n\n### Verification:\n- After moving D to (3,4) on Turn 72:\n  - On Turn 73, can move D to (3,3).\n  - On Turn 74, can move D to (3,2) but it's still occupied (by tail), so must move elsewhere (e.g., L to (2,3) or R to (4,3)).\n  - On Turn 75, (3,2) becomes free, and head can be adjacent to it (e.g., at (3,3) or (4,2)).\n  - On Turn 76, move to (3,2) to eat the food.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe best immediate action is to move **down (D)** to (3,4) to start positioning the snake to eat the food at (3,2) on Turn 76.\n\n\\boxed{D}",

Let me confirm.\n> \n> Walls: border cells x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So moving to x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 is a wall collision. Internal obstacle at (1,6). So the grid is 8x8, but cells like (1,1) to (6,6) are playable, except where walls or obstacles are.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (1,6) means that cell is blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (3,5), and direction is down (D). So moving down would decrease y, since y=0 is bottom? Typically in grids, y increases upwards, but let's see the movement definitions.\n> \n> Movement: U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), so y increases upwards. So (0,0) is bottom-left or top-left? U is (x,y+1), so y+1 is up, so y=0 is the bottom row, y=7 is top row? Let's see the coordinates.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (3,5), and moving down to, say, (3,4) or something.

Countdown decreases every turn, including current, so on turn 72, life span 3, so it will be there for turns 72,73,74, and disappear after turn 74 or at the end of turn 74? Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So for a food with life span L on turn T, it will be present until turn T + L - 1, and disappear at the start of turn T + L or something.

Look at positions: (4,4) is there, but (3,4) is not in the list. Positions: (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), etc., no (3,4). So (3,4) is free? Let's list all occupied cells:\n> \n> From snake: (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)\n> \n> So (3,4) is not listed, so it should be free. Similarly, (2,5) not listed, (4,5) not listed? (4,5) is not in the list. Positions have (3,5), (5,5), but not (4,5). (4,6) is there, but (4,5) no. So (4,5) is free?

It's turn 72, and the grid is 8x8 because walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so coordinates from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls occupy those borders, so playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6) I think? Let me confirm.\n> \n> Walls: border cells x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So moving to x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 is a wall collision. Internal obstacle at (1,6). So the grid is 8x8, but cells like (1,1) to (6,6) are playable, except where walls or obstacles are.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (1,6) means that cell is blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (3,5), and direction is down (D). So moving down would decrease y, since y=0 is bottom? Typically in grids, y increases upwards, but let's see the movement definitions.\n> \n> Movement: U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), so y increases upwards. So (0,0) is bottom-left or top-left? U is (x,y+1), so y+1 is up, so y=0 is the bottom row, y=7 is top row? Let's see the coordinates.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (3,5), and moving down to, say, (3,4) or something. Let's list all positions.\n> \n> Snake: [(3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)]\n> \n> Head at (3,5), direction D (down, so y decreasing).\n> \n> Food:\n> \n> - (5,3) with life span 3, value 1 (positive food)\n> \n> - (3,2) with life span 8, value 1 (positive food)\n> \n> Both are positive food, no negative food mentioned.\n> \n> Life span: for (5,3), life span 3, meaning it disappears after 3 turns, including current turn? Countdown decreases every turn, including current, so on turn 72, life span 3, so it will be there for turns 72,73,74, and disappear after turn 74 or at the end of turn 74? Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So for a food with life span L on turn T, it will be present until turn T + L - 1, and disappear at the start of turn T + L or something. Need to be careful.\n> \n> \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" so on turn when it's spawned, countdown is L, then next turn L-1, ..., down to 1, and on the turn when countdown is 1, after that turn it disappears? But the rule says \"disappears after N turns\", meaning after N turns from now.\n> \n> Let's read: \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So for food at turn t with life span N, countdown starts at N on turn t, decreases by 1 each turn, so after N turns, at turn t + N, it should be gone. But on turn t, countdown is N; turn t+1, countdown N-1; ... turn t + N - 1, countdown 1; on turn t + N, it disappears, so not present.\n> \n> But for eating, it can be eaten on any turn before it disappears.\n> \n> For (5,3), life span 3 on turn 72, so:\n> \n> - Turn 72: countdown 3\n> \n> - Turn 73: countdown 2\n> \n> - Turn 74: countdown 1\n> \n> - Turn 75: disappears, so not present.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,2) life span 8 on turn 72:\n> \n> - Turn 72: countdown 8\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - Turn 79: countdown 1\n> \n> - Turn 80: disappears.\n> \n> Now, snake head is at (3,5), direction D.\n> \n> Current possible moves: since direction is D, I can move L, R, or D, but not U, because no instant reverse.

Internal obstacle at (1,6), not relevant here.\n> \n> Now, body collision: snake positions: [(3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)]\n> \n> So cells occupied: (3,5) is head, but when I move, head moves to new position, and tail might move.\n> \n> Collision: if head moves to a cell occupied by a body segment, except the tail, because tail will move away.\n> \n> Specifically: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, if head moves to a cell that is currently occupied by the tail, it's ok, because tail moves, so no collision. But if it moves to any other body segment, collision.\n> \n> Also, if the food is under the body, it can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves in.\n> \n> Now, for possible moves from (3,5):\n> \n> - D to (3,4): is (3,4) occupied? Look at positions: (4,4) is there, but (3,4) is not in the list. Positions: (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), etc., no (3,4). So (3,4) is free? Let's list all occupied cells:\n> \n> From snake: (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)\n> \n> So (3,4) is not listed, so it should be free. Similarly, (2,5) not listed, (4,5) not listed? (4,5) is not in the list. Positions have (3,5), (5,5), but not (4,5). (4,6) is there, but (4,5) no. So (4,5) is free? Let's see: indices: head (3,5), then (3,6), which is above? y=6, so (3,6) is north of (3,5) since y+1 is up.\n> \n> y increases up, so (3,5) to (3,6) is up, so head at (3,5), then body at (3,6), which is above it, but since direction is down, that means the snake was moving down to (3,5) from (3,6)? Let's see the positions order: head first, so [(3,5) head, (3,6) next, which is the segment behind head.\n> \n> In snake, positions are listed head first, then the body segments in order to tail.\n> \n> So head: (3,5)\n> \n> Next: (3,6) — this is the first body segment, which is at same x, y+1, so north of head.\n> \n> Then (4,6) — east of (3,6)\n> \n> Then (5,6) — east\n> \n> Then (5,5) — south, since y decreased\n> \n> Then (6,5) — east\n> \n> Then (6,4) — south\n> \n> (6,3) — south\n> \n> (6,2) — south\n> \n> (6,1) — south\n> \n> (5,1) — west\n> \n> (4,1) — west\n> \n> (3,1) — west\n> \n> (2,1) — west\n> \n> (2,2) — north\n> \n> (3,2) — east\n> \n> (4,2) — east\n> \n> (4,3) — north\n> \n> (4,4) — north\n> \n> Tail at (4,4)\n> \n> Now, from head (3,5), possible moves:\n> \n> - Down (D): to (3,4) — is this occupied?

Positions have (4,6), (4,4), (4,3), etc., but not (4,5), so free.\n> \n> (4,5) should be between (4,6) and (4,4) in path? Let's see the snake path: from (4,6) to (5,6) to (5,5), so it went from (4,6) to (5,6) east, then to (5,5) south, so (4,5) was not visited recently. Similarly, (2,5) not visited. (3,4) not visited.\n> \n> Also, walls: (3,4) is x=3,y=4, between 1-6, not wall. (2,5) x=2,y=5, not wall. (4,5) same.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (1,6), not relevant.\n> \n> So all three moves are possible: D to (3,4), L to (2,5), R to (4,5).\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead, prioritize long-term survival, and maximize score by eating positive food.\n> \n> Food available:\n> \n> - (5,3) at turn 72 with life span 3, so must be eaten by turn 74.\n> \n> - (3,2) with life span 8, so must be eaten by turn 79.\n> \n> Also, (3,2) is currently occupied by a body segment? (3,2) is in snake positions: it's the 15th segment?

It's turn 74, and I'm controlling the snake. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and one internal obstacle at (1,6). So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls block those cells.\n> \n> Snake positions: The head is at (3,3), and the direction is down (D). So moving down means increasing y? Let's clarify coordinates. Typically in grids, (0,0) is bottom-left or top-left? The problem doesn't specify, but since head direction is D and positions are given, let's list them:\n> \n> Snake: [(3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2)]\n> \n> Head at (3,3), direction D. If D is down, and y increases, then down would decrease y? I need to define the coordinate system.\n> \n> From the positions: (3,3) to (3,4) to (3,5) to (3,6) – so as we go from head to body, y is increasing. But head direction is D, down. If head is at (3,3) and moving down, it should go to a lower y if y=0 is bottom.\n> \n> Perhaps y=0 is the top? Let's see the positions.\n> \n> (3,3) head, direction D (down). Then next position should be, if moving down, to (3,2) or something, but the list shows (3,4) as the first body segment? No, the list is from head to tail: index 0 is head, index 1 is next, etc.\n> \n> So head is at (3,3), then body segments: (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), so from (3,3) to (3,4), that's increasing y, so if y increases upward, then (3,4) is above (3,3), so moving up? But head direction is D, down.\n> \n> Inconsistency.\n> \n> Perhaps y=0 is the top, so higher y is downward.\n> \n> Standard in many grids: y=0 top, y increases downward.\n> \n> Yes, that makes sense. So in this case, (3,3) to (3,4) is downward, since y increases down.\n> \n> Head at (3,3), moving D (down), so next cell would be (3,4), but the body is at (3,4), so that means the snake just moved down to (3,3)? Let's see the sequence.\n> \n> The positions are listed as [(3,3), (3,4), (3,5), ...] so (3,3) is head, then (3,4) is the first body segment, meaning the head was previously at (3,4) or something.\n> \n> At turn t, head is at position[0], and it moved there from previous position.\n> \n> Head direction is the direction it moved to get to current head position.\n> \n> So head is at (3,3), and direction is D, meaning it moved down to (3,3), so from where? Probably from (3,2) or something, but let's see the positions.\n> \n> The body segments: after head (3,3), we have (3,4), so the segment that was head before is now at (3,4), so if it moved down to (3,3), it must have been at (3,2) before? But (3,2) is in the list later: positions include (6,2), (6,1), etc., and (3,2) is also there.\n> \n> Full list: [(3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2)]\n> \n> So at turn t, head is at (3,3), which it just moved to, and direction D means it came from above, so from (3,2)? But (3,2) is in the body, at index 17: positions[17] is (3,2), which is part of the body.\n> \n> Let's find the previous head position. Before moving, head was at the position that is now positions[1], which is (3,4). So from (3,4) it moved down to (3,3)? But (3,4) to (3,3) is up if y=0 top, y down increasing?

No.\n> \n> At the beginning of turn, head and tail are at positions.\n> \n> If head moves to tail cell, which has food, it eats the food, so the tail cell is occupied by both tail and food, but food is separate.\n> \n> When head moves to a cell with food, it eats it, and the cell is free before head moves? No, the cell may be occupied or not.\n> \n> In this case, if tail is at (T) and food is at (T), same cell.\n> \n> When snake moves, head moves to a new position.\n> \n> If head moves to (T), which is the tail position, and there is food, then it eats the food, and since it eats, the tail does not move, so the snake grows: new head at (T), and the old tail remains, so now head and old tail are at same position? Collision.\n> \n> Yes, that's the danger.\n> \n> So if head moves directly to the tail cell to eat the food, since tail is there, head and tail collide after the move, because tail doesn't move when eating.\n> \n> Therefore, to avoid, head should not be adjacent to tail when tail has food, or if it is, not move directly to it.\n> \n> In this case, for (3,2) food, after turn 74 move, if I move L to (2,3), head at (2,3), tail at (3,2), which are not adjacent, so ok.\n> \n> Then, (3,2) has food, and is tail.\n> \n> To eat it, I can move head to (3,2) from adjacent cell.\n> \n> But head is at (2,3), which is adjacent to (3,2)?

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State\n\nFirst, let's summarize the current state of the game at Turn 75:\n\n- **Grid Dimensions**: The playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), with walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and an internal obstacle at (1,6).\n- **Snake**:\n  - **Head**: At (4,3), moving right (R).\n  - **Body Segments**: 18 segments following the head, ending with the tail at (3,2).\n  - **Length**: 19 segments.\n- **Food**:\n  - (3,2): Value +1, life span 6 (available until turn 80).\n  - (2,6): Value +1, life span 8 (available until turn 82).\n\n### Possible Actions at Turn 75\n\nFrom the head position (4,3) moving right (R), the possible immediate moves are:\n\n1. **Up (U)**: (4,4)\n2. **Down (D)**: (4,2)\n3. **Right (R)**: (5,3)\n   \n   - **Left (L)**: (3,3) is not allowed because it's the opposite of the current direction (R).\n\nNow, let's evaluate each possible move:\n\n#### 1. Move Up (U) to (4,4)\n\n- **Safety Check**: (4,4) is not occupied by the snake's body or walls.\n- **Outcome**: \n  - Moves head to (4,4).\n  - Tail moves from (3,2), making (3,2) free with food.\n- **Next Steps**:\n  - From (4,4), possible moves are U to (4,5), R to (5,4), but D and L are blocked by body segments.\n  - Moving U to (4,5) leads to potential dead ends as adjacent cells might be blocked by the snake's body.\n\n**Conclusion**: Moving U could lead to being trapped, especially since the snake is long (19 segments) and space is limited.\n\n#### 2. Move Down (D) to (4,2)\n\n- **Safety Check**: (4,2) is free.\n- **Outcome**:\n  - Moves head to (4,2).\n  - Tail moves from (3,2), making (3,2) free with food.\n- **Next Steps**:\n  - From (4,2), can move L to (3,2) to eat the food.\n    - (3,2) is now free and adjacent to (4,2).\n    - Eating (3,2) is safe because the head is not adjacent to the tail (head at (4,2), tail at (2,2) after move).\n  - After eating, head is at (3,2), then must move L to (2,2) to avoid collision with body segments.\n  - Then, can move U to (2,3), U to (2,4), etc., towards (2,6) to eat the other food.\n\n**Advantage**: This sequence allows eating both foods efficiently without immediate risks.\n\n#### 3. Move Right (R) to (5,3)\n\n- **Safety Check**: (5,3) is free.\n- **Outcome**:\n  - Moves head to (5,3).\n  - Tail moves from (3,2), making (3,2) free with food.\n- **Next Steps**:\n  - From (5,3), can move U to (5,4) or D to (5,2), but L is blocked by body segment (4,3).\n  - Moving towards (2,6) would require more turns and might miss eating (3,2) in time.\n\n**Disadvantage**: Less efficient in eating both foods quickly.\n\n### Optimal Action Sequence\n\nBased on the above, the most efficient sequence to maximize score by eating both foods while avoiding risks is:\n\n1. **Turn 75: D (Down) to (4,2)**\n   - Frees (3,2) with food.\n2. **Turn 76: L (Left) to (3,2)**\n   - Eats the food at (3,2), increasing length to 20.\n3. **Turn 77: L (Left) to (2,2)**\n   - Necessary to avoid collision; moves towards (2,6).\n4. **Turn 78: U (Up) to (2,3)**\n   - Starts moving up towards (2,6).\n5. **Turn 79: U (Up) to (2,4)**\n   - Continues path to (2,6).\n\nThis sequence ensures:\n- Eating (3,2) by turn 76 (before it disappears at turn 80).\n- Positioning to eat (2,6) by turn 81 (before it disappears at turn 82).\n- Avoiding collisions and dead ends.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{D} (for Turn 75)\n\n**Action Sequence (next turns for context):**\n- Turn 75: D\n- Turn 76: L\n- Turn 77: L\n- Turn 78: U\n- Turn 79: U\n\n**Main Thinking Conclusion:**\nThe immediate action D (Down) is chosen to free the cell (3,2) with positive food, allowing the snake to eat it safely on the next turn (L). This is followed by moving left to (2,2) and then upwards towards the other positive food at (2,6), ensuring both foods are consumed efficiently while avoiding collisions and maximizing the score. This plan leverages the current snake configuration and food positions to optimize movement within the constrained grid.",
        "state": "**Current Turn**: \\( t_0 = 75 \\)\n**Cells occupied by walls**:\n\t - Border Cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7.\n\t - Internal Obstacles: [(1, 6)]\n**Snake Positions**:[(4, 3), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 6), (5, 6), (5, 5), (6, 5), (6, 4), (6, 3), (6, 2), (6, 1), (5, 1), (4, 1), (3, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2)]\n**Snake Head Direction**: R\n**Food Positions, Life Span and Value**:\n\t- (3, 2, 6, 1)\n\t- (2, 6, 8, 1)\n> **Guidance from a Previous Thinking Model:** Turn \\( t_1 = 75 \\)\n> <think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 75, and the grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think? Let me confirm: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? No, walls are at x=0 and x=7, so x from 1 to 6 inclusive? Similarly for y.\n> \n> Walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So cells with x=0 or x=7 are walls, and y=0 or y=7 are walls. Also, internal obstacle at (1,6).\n> \n> Snake positions: Head at (4,3), direction R (right), so moving east. Body segments: (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2). That's 19 segments? Let me count: positions from head to tail: (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2). That's 19 positions. Snake length is 19.\n> \n> Food: Two items:\n> \n> - (3,2) with value 1, life span 6\n> \n> - (2,6) with value 1, life span 8\n> \n> Both are positive food since value is +1.\n> \n> Now, the food at (3,2) is interesting because it's currently under the snake's tail. Snake positions end with (3,2), which is the tail. And food is at (3,2) with life span 6.\n> \n> Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 75, life span 6 means it will disappear after 5 more turns? Life span N: disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current. So at turn t, if life span is L, it will disappear at turn t + L - 1? Let's clarify.\n> \n> If at turn t, life span is N, then:\n> \n> - On turn t, life span decreases to N-1? Or at the start of turn?\n> \n> The rule says: \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> I think it means that when food is spawned, it has life span N, and each turn, including the turn it spawns, the life span decreases by 1, so after N turns, it disappears. For example, if spawned at turn t with life span N, then at turn t, life span is N, at turn t+1, N-1, ..., at turn t + N - 1, life span 1, and after turn t + N - 1, it disappears, so not present on turn t + N.\n> \n> But in the state, it's given at current turn with life span, so for food at (3,2), life span 6 at turn 75. So:\n> \n> - Turn 75: life span 6\n> \n> - Turn 76: life span 5\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - Turn 80: life span 1\n> \n> - Disappears after turn 80, so not on turn 81.\n> \n> Similarly for (2,6): life span 8 at turn 75, so disappears after turn 82.\n> \n> Now, the snake head is at (4,3), moving right (R), so from (4,3), possible moves: U, D, L, R. But cannot move left (L) because that would be opposite to current direction R? No instant reverse: cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\n> \n> Current direction is R, so next move cannot be L (left). Allowed moves: U, D, R. L is not allowed.\n> \n> Also, need to avoid walls and body collisions, but body collision: head touches body segment except that it can move to the tail cell because tail will move away.\n> \n> Now, the food at (3,2) is currently occupied by the tail, so it can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves onto it. But (3,2) is the tail, so when the snake moves, the tail will move if it doesn't eat, so the food might become accessible.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (2,6) is free, I think. Is (2,6) occupied? Snake positions: let's list all snake cells to see where food is.\n> \n> Snake positions: (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2)\n> \n> Food at (3,2) is exactly the tail position, so occupied.\n> \n> Food at (2,6): is (2,6) in snake? Snake has (2,1), (2,2), but not (2,6). (3,6) is snake, (2,6) is not listed. Walls: internal obstacle at (1,6), but (2,6) should be free? Walls are at borders and (1,6), so (2,6) is within bounds, no wall, not snake, so food at (2,6) is accessible.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,2) is occupied by tail, so not directly accessible.\n> \n> Now, to eat (3,2), since it's under tail, we need to move such that the tail moves away, and then head moves to (3,2) when it's free.\n> \n> But there's a danger: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> In this case, food at (3,2) is under tail, so if we eat it, when head moves to (3,2), and since we eat, the tail doesn't move, so the segment that was tail stays, but new segment grows, so the position where head was becomes new body, and tail stays? Standard snake: when you eat, head moves to food, new segment is added, so tail doesn't move. So if head moves to a cell that was tail, it's okay only if that tail was about to move, but since eating, tail stays, so head moves to where tail is, and since tail was there, after move, the cell has head and then the body, but it's the same cell for a moment? I think in terms of collision, when head moves to a cell, if that cell has any body segment except the current tail (which moves away if not eaten), but when eating, tail doesn't move.\n> \n> The rule: \"Tail Reward Danger\": specifically, if head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head moves to tail cell, and since eating, the tail doesn't move, so the head and the new tail (which is the old position) will be adjacent or something? Let's read carefully.\n> \n> \"**Tail Reward Danger**: If the head is *adjacent to the tail* and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n> \n> So, this is a special case. Here, head is not adjacent to tail currently. Head at (4,3), tail at (3,2). Are they adjacent? (4,3) and (3,2): x differs by 1, y differs by 1, so not adjacent; adjacent means same row or column, differ by 1 in one coordinate. (4,3) and (3,2): Δx=1, Δy=1, so diagonal, not adjacent. Adjacent cells share an edge, so same x, |Δy|=1 or same y, |Δx|=1.\n> \n> So (4,3) and (3,2) are not adjacent; they are diagonal. Adjacent cells would be (4,3) to (4,2), (4,4), (3,3), (5,3), etc.\n> \n> Tail is at (3,2), head at (4,3), so not adjacent. Therefore, if we can move head to (3,2) after tail moves away, it might be possible to eat without immediate death.\n> \n> But we need to plan.\n> \n> First, let's map the grid.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, since walls at 0,7.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (1,6).\n> \n> Snake positions: let's plot for clarity.\n> \n> Rows y=6 to y=1 (top to bottom?

It's turn 76, and I'm the snake AI. The grid has walls: border cells at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and an internal obstacle at (1,6). So, the grid is 8x8 from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls block those cells.\n> \n> Snake positions: Head is at (4,2), and the body segments follow: (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2). That's 19 segments, so the snake is quite long.\n> \n> Head direction is Down (D). That means the snake was moving down to (4,2) from (4,3)? Positions are listed head first, so from head to tail: (4,2) is head, then (4,3), which is directly below if we consider y increasing upwards? Let's clarify the coordinate system.\n> \n> Typically in such grids, y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top, or vice versa? The movement: U is (x,y+1), which might mean increasing y is up. But let's see the positions: head at (4,2), direction D (down), so moving down decreases y? I need to confirm.\n> \n> Movement: U (x,y+1) – if y+1 is up, then increasing y is upward. D (x,y-1) decreasing y is down. Similarly, R (x+1,y) right, L (x-1,y) left.\n> \n> In the snake positions, head at (4,2), then next is (4,3). If y increases upwards, (4,3) is above (4,2), but direction is down, which is decreasing y. That doesn't make sense because if head is at (4,2) and moving down to y-1, it should be going to (4,1), but the next position is (4,3), which has higher y, so y must be increasing downward or something.\n> \n> I think there's confusion. Let me list the positions:\n> \n> - Head: (4,2)\n> \n> - Segment 2: (4,3)\n> \n> - Segment 3: (3,3)\n> \n> - Segment 4: (3,4)\n> \n> - Segment 5: (3,5)\n> \n> - Segment 6: (3,6)\n> \n> - Segment 7: (4,6)\n> \n> - Segment 8: (5,6)\n> \n> - Segment 9: (5,5)\n> \n> - Segment 10: (6,5)\n> \n> - Segment 11: (6,4)\n> \n> - Segment 12: (6,3)\n> \n> - Segment 13: (6,2)\n> \n> - Segment 14: (6,1)\n> \n> - Segment 15: (5,1)\n> \n> - Segment 16: (4,1)\n> \n> - Segment 17: (3,1)\n> \n> - Segment 18: (2,1)\n> \n> - Segment 19: (2,2)  // tail\n> \n> Direction is Down. From head at (4,2), moving down to... but the previous position must be where it came from. Since positions are head first, the head was at some position before moving to (4,2). Direction Down means it moved to (4,2) by decreasing y or something.\n> \n> Perhaps y=0 is top, y=7 is bottom? Let's see: if y increases downward, then U (y+1) is down, D (y-1) is up. That might be it.\n> \n> Standard: in many games, y=0 is top row, y increases downward. So U (y-1) up? No, the movement is defined: U (x,y+1) – if y+1, and y increases down, then y+1 is downward, so U is down? That's confusing.\n> \n> Let's read the movement constraints: \"U`(x,y+1)`, D`(x,y-1)`, L`(x-1,y)`, R`(x+1,y)`\"\n> \n> And head direction is D, which is (x,y-1), so decreasing y.\n> \n> In the positions, head at (4,2), and the next segment is (4,3). If y increases downward, (4,3) is below (4,2), so the head moved from (4,3) to (4,2) by decreasing y, which is moving up? But direction is D, which is down, but decreasing y would be up if y increases down.\n> \n> I think I need to define the coordinate system. Let's assume that (0,0) is bottom-left or top-left? Typically in grids, (0,0) is top-left, y increasing downward, x increasing right.\n> \n> So:\n> \n> - U: (x, y-1)  // up, decreasing y\n> \n> - D: (x, y+1)  // down, increasing y\n> \n> - L: (x-1, y)  // left, decreasing x\n> \n> - R: (x+1, y)  // right, increasing x\n> \n> But the movement is defined as U (x,y+1), which if y+1, and y increasing down, U would be down, but that's not standard. The notation says U (x,y+1), but in standard, U should decrease y.\n> \n> Perhaps there's a mistake in the definition. Let's read carefully: \"U`(x,y+1)`\" – this might mean that for U, the new position is (x, y+1), so if y+1, it's moving to higher y, which is downward if y increases down.\n> \n> But direction D is (x,y-1), so decreasing y, upward.\n> \n> In the snake, head at (4,2), direction D, so it came from a cell with higher y? Let's see the positions: head at (4,2), segment 2 at (4,3). If y increases downward, (4,3) is below (4,2), so the head moved from (4,3) to (4,2), which is decreasing y, so moving up, but direction is D, which should be down. Inconsistency.\n> \n> Perhaps the positions are listed with head first, so the snake was previously at (4,3) and moved to (4,2) by moving down? But if y increases down, moving from (4,3) to (4,2) is moving to smaller y, which is up, not down.\n> \n> I think the coordinate system must have y=0 at bottom or top. Let's assume (0,0) is bottom-left for simplicity, so y increases up. But the wall borders are y=0 and y=7, so if y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top, then U (y+1) would be up, D (y-1) down.\n> \n> But the movement is U (x,y+1) – if y+1 and y increases up, U is up. D (x,y-1) down.\n> \n> In positions, head at (4,2), segment 2 at (4,3). If y increases up, (4,3) is above (4,2), so the head moved from (4,3) to (4,2) by moving down to (4,2), which is D, decreasing y, so y decreases when moving down. That means y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top, y increases upward.\n> \n> So: (x,y) with y=0 bottom, y=7 top, so U (x,y+1) moves up (increasing y), D (x,y-1) moves down (decreasing y), L (x-1,y) left, R (x+1,y) right.\n> \n> Head at (4,2), direction D, so it moved down to (4,2) from (4,3) at previous turn, since (4,3) is the next segment.\n> \n> Similarly, tail is at (2,2).\n> \n> Now, food positions:\n> \n> - (3,2) with life span 5, value 1 (positive food)\n> \n> - (2,6) with life span 7, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (4,4) with life span 10, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> All food is positive, no negative food here.\n> \n> Life span: for (3,2), it disappears after 5 turns, including current turn, so it has 5 turns left, including turn 76. Similarly, (2,6) has 7 turns, (4,4) has 10 turns.\n> \n> Current turn is 76, so (3,2) will disappear after turn 80 (since it appears on turn it spawns, and countdown decreases each turn, including current, so with life span N, it disappears after N-1 more turns? Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So for food at turn t with life span L, it will be gone at turn t + L. Countdown starts at L and decreases to 0, at which point it disappears.

The snake's body segments follow the head, ending with the tail at (2, 2).\n- **Walls**: Borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and an internal obstacle at (1, 6).\n- **Food**: \n  - (2, 6) with value +1, life_span 6.\n  - (4, 4) with value +1, life_span 9.\n\n### Possible Moves:\nFrom the current head position (3, 2) and direction L, the possible moves are:\n1. **Left (L)**: Move to (2, 2). \n   - (2, 2) is the current tail position. Since no food is at (2, 2), this is safe (the tail will move away as the snake advances).\n2. **Up (U)**: Move to (3, 3).\n   - (3, 3) is occupied by the snake's body (collision).\n3. **Down (D)**: Move to (3, 1).\n   - (3, 1) is occupied by the snake's body (collision).\n\n### Collision Check:\n- Moving Left to (2, 2): Safe (tail will move away, no food).\n- Moving Up or Down: Both result in immediate collision with the snake's body.\n\n### Immediate Action:\nThe only safe move is **Left (L)** to (2, 2). \n\n### Additional Considerations:\n- The previous thinking model's plan aligns with this immediate action (move L to (2, 2)) and suggests a longer-term strategy to avoid the risky (2, 6) food and aim for the safer (4, 4) food.\n- The snake is long (20 segments), so space is tight, and careful movement is required to avoid trapping itself.\n\n### Final Decision:\nThe immediate action for Turn \\( t_0 = 77 \\) is to move **Left (L)**.\n\n\\boxed{L}",

It's turn 77. The grid has walls at the borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (1,6). The snake is a list of positions starting from the head: head at (3,2), then body segments to (2,2) at the tail. The head is moving left, so direction is L.\n> \n> Food positions are given as (x, y, life_span, value). So:\n> \n> - Food at (2,6) with life_span 6 and value +1 (positive food)\n> \n> - Food at (4,4) with life_span 9 and value +1 (also positive food)\n> \n> Both foods are positive, so eating them increases length by 1 and score by 1. But I need to be careful about the tail reward danger.\n> \n> Snake positions: let's list them to understand the shape.\n> \n> Head: (3,2)\n> \n> Then: (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2)\n> \n> That's 20 segments. So the snake is 20 cells long.\n> \n> Now, the head is at (3,2) and direction is L, so it's moving left. From (3,2), moving left would go to (2,2). But (2,2) is the tail.\n> \n> Current head position: (3,2)\n> \n> Direction: L, so if I move left, head goes to (2,2).\n> \n> But (2,2) is currently occupied by the tail. According to the rules, moving into the tail cell is allowed because the tail will move forward, so it should be safe unless there's a special case.\n> \n> The tail reward danger: if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and new tail collide.\n> \n> But in this case, the tail is at (2,2), and there's no food there currently. The foods are at (2,6) and (4,4), so (2,2) has no food. So moving to (2,2) should be fine; the tail will move away as the snake advances.\n> \n> When the head moves to a cell, if that cell has food, it gets eaten. But (2,2) doesn't have food, so no issue.\n> \n> After moving left to (2,2), the new head position is (2,2), and the tail will move off (2,2) to whatever the next position is, but since we're moving, the snake shifts.\n> \n> Let's simulate one move.\n> \n> Current snake: [(3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2)]\n> \n> After moving left, head moves to (2,2). But (2,2) is the last element, the tail. Since we're moving to it, and it's not food, the tail should move forward, so the new snake will be: new head at (2,2), then the body from (3,2) to (2,1), but (2,1) was the second last.\n> \n> After move: head is new position, and the tail is removed unless food is eaten.\n> \n> Since no food is eaten, when head moves to (2,2), which was the tail position, but since it's not food, the tail segment is removed, and the new snake is: [(2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), ..., up to (2,1)] but without the last element.\n> \n> Original positions: index 0: (3,2) head, then 1: (4,2), 2: (4,3), 3: (3,3), 4: (3,4), 5: (3,5), 6: (3,6), 7: (4,6), 8: (5,6), 9: (5,5), 10: (6,5), 11: (6,4), 12: (6,3), 13: (6,2), 14: (6,1), 15: (5,1), 16: (4,1), 17: (3,1), 18: (2,1), 19: (2,2) tail.\n> \n> After moving left, head moves to (2,2). Since (2,2) was the tail and no food, the new head is at (2,2), and the body is from index 0 to 18: (3,2), (4,2), ..., (2,1). So new snake: [(2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1)]\n> \n> The tail is now (2,1), and head is (2,2).\n> \n> (2,2) is now the head, and (2,1) is the tail.\n> \n> Now, I need to think multiple turns ahead. The goal is to maximize score by eating positive food while avoiding risks.\n> \n> Available moves: from current head (3,2) with direction L.\n> \n> Possible moves: since direction is L, I can move L (left), U (up), D (down), but not R (right) because that's opposite and not allowed instantly.\n> \n> No instant reverse: so from L, I cannot move R.

Borders are y=0 and y=7, so y=1 is within, not wall. Walls are at y=0 and y=7, so cells with y=1 to y=6 are fine, except obstacles.\n> \n> (1,6) is obstacle, but (3,1) is fine.\n> \n> Now, body collision: for (2,2), it is currently the tail, but as we move, it will be vacated, so moving to (2,2) is safe.\n> \n> For (3,3): what is at (3,3)? In snake positions, (3,3) is the fourth segment: positions index 3 is (3,3), so it's a body segment. If I move up to (3,3), head would hit the body, collision.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,1): position index 17 is (3,1), which is also a body segment, so moving down to (3,1) would also cause collision.\n> \n> Current snake positions: head at (3,2), then (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), etc.\n> \n> So adjacent cells:\n> \n> - Left: (2,2) - which is tail, but will move.\n> \n> - Up: (3,3) - which is occupied by body segment at index 3.\n> \n> - Down: (3,1) - occupied by body segment at index 17.\n> \n> - Right: (4,2) - occupied by body segment at index 1, and also opposite direction, not allowed anyway.\n> \n> So the only safe move from (3,2) is Left to (2,2).

No.\n> \n> Let's think carefully.\n> \n> Before move: head at H, tail at T, and T has positive food.\n> \n> Head is adjacent to T, so H is next to T.\n> \n> Then head moves to T.\n> \n> Now, after move, head is at T.\n> \n> Since food eaten, the snake grows: so the tail does not move. That means the segment at T remains, but head is now also at T? Conflict.\n> \n> In terms of positions: before move, positions: [H, ..., P, T] where P is parent of tail.\n> \n> Head moves to T, so new head at T.\n> \n> Since food eaten, we add a new segment, so the new positions are [T, H, ..., P, T] but T is duplicated, which is invalid.\n> \n> Typically, in snake, when you eat, you add a new segment at the tail end, but since head moved to T, and T was tail, now head is at T, and the previous tail T is still there, but it should be part of the body.\n> \n> Standard way: the snake body includes all segments.\n> \n> When no eat: head moves to new cell, tail moves off, so positions shift.\n> \n> When eat: head moves to new cell (with food), tail stays, so positions: new head at food cell, then previous head, and so on, up to tail unchanged, so length increases by one.\n> \n> In the case where head moves to tail cell:\n> \n> Before: positions [H, B1, B2, ..., Bk, T] with H adjacent to T.\n> \n> Head moves to T.\n> \n> After: new head at T.\n> \n> Since ate food, tail does not move, so positions become [T, H, B1, B2, ..., Bk, T] but T is duplicated, and head at T, but T is also the last element, so collision at T.\n> \n> Yes, so it kills the snake because head and tail are on the same cell after growth.\n> \n> The rules say \"head and newly grown tail will collide\" but in this case, it's the old tail that is still there.\n> \n> Anyway, the point is, it's dangerous to eat the food when it is on the tail cell and head is adjacent.\n> \n> In our case, for (2,6), when I plan to eat it on turn 81, I need to ensure that the tail is not adjacent or the cell is not tail.\n> \n> Similarly for other food.\n> \n> Back to the plan.\n> \n> If I go to (2,6) via (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6).\n> \n> On turn 81, I move to (2,6).\n> \n> At that time, where is the tail?\n> \n> Currently on turn 77, tail at (2,2) but after moves, it changes.\n> \n> Let's simulate the tail movement.\n> \n> On turn 77: move L to (2,2), snake as above, tail at (2,1)\n> \n> After turn 77: snake positions with tail at (2,1)\n> \n> Turn 78: move U to (2,3), new head (2,3), remove tail (2,1), so tail is now (3,1) or whatever.\n> \n> After turn 77: snake [(2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1)] tail (2,1)\n> \n> Turn 78: move U to (2,3), no food, so new snake: head (2,3), then (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1) tail at (3,1)\n> \n> Turn 79: move U to (2,4), no food, new snake: head (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1) tail at (4,1)\n> \n> Turn 80: move U to (2,5), no food, new snake: head (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1) tail at (5,1)\n> \n> Turn 81: move U to (2,6), which has food, positive, so eat it.

The description says \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So for food at (2,6,5,1), at turn 78, life span 5, so it will disappear after 5 turns, meaning at the start of turn 83, it should be gone?

So it is present from turn t to turn t+N-1, and disappears at turn t+N.\n> \n> \"Disappears after N turns\" might be ambiguous. But \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" suggests that on the turn it is spawned, countdown is N, and it decreases each turn, so after k turns, countdown is N-k, and when countdown reaches 0, it disappears at the end of that turn or beginning of next? The description doesn't specify, but for eating, as long as it's there when the head moves onto it, it can be eaten.\n> \n> Typically, we can assume that food is present as long as life span >0, and can be eaten on any turn where life span >=1.\n> \n> For simplicity, at turn t, if life span is L, it can be eaten on turns t, t+1, ..., t+L-1, and disappears at turn t+L.\n> \n> Similarly for the other food.\n> \n> Food at (2,6): value 1, life span 5 at turn 78.

It's turn 78, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since the borders are x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7. There's an internal obstacle at (1,6).\n> \n> The snake positions are given: head at (2,2), and it's moving left. The body segments follow: (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1). Let me plot this mentally to understand the shape.\n> \n> Starting from head: (2,2) is head, moving left. Then (3,2), which is east of head? Coordinates: assuming (0,0) is bottom-left or top-left? Typically in such grids, (0,0) might be top-left or bottom-left. But in the food positions, (2,6) and (4,4), and walls at borders, so let's assume (0,0) is top-left for simplicity, but I should confirm.\n> \n> The snake positions: head at (2,2), then (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1). That's 20 segments, so length 20.\n> \n> Now, direction is left, so from (2,2), moving left would go to (1,2) or (2,1)? Head direction is L, meaning left, so decreasing x.\n> \n> Current head position: (2,2), direction left, so previous move was left, but positions show head at (2,2), and next is (3,2), which has higher x, so if head is moving left to (2,2), but (3,2) is to the right, which means the body is behind. Let's list positions in order:\n> \n> Index 0: head (2,2)\n> \n> Index 1: (3,2)  // which is east of head, so if head is moving left to (2,2), then (3,2) is the first body segment, which is to the right.\n> \n> Perhaps the grid has (0,0) as bottom-left? Let me assume standard: x from left to right, y from bottom to top or top to bottom? Food at (2,6) and (4,4), walls at y=0 and y=7, so if y=0 is bottom, y=7 top, then (2,6) is near top.\n> \n> Snake positions: head (2,2), which if y=0 bottom, (2,2) is near bottom. Then (3,2) same y, x+1, so east. Then (4,2), east. Then (4,3), north. Then (3,3), west. Then (3,4), north. Then (3,5), north. Then (3,6), north. Then (4,6), east. Then (5,6), east. Then (5,5), south. Then (6,5), east. Then (6,4), south. Then (6,3), south. Then (6,2), south. Then (6,1), south. Then (5,1), west. Then (4,1), west. Then (3,1), west. Then (2,1), west? (2,1) is west of (3,1), but head is at (2,2), so the tail is at (2,1).\n> \n> From (2,2) to (3,2) to (4,2) to (4,3) to (3,3) to (3,4) to (3,5) to (3,6) to (4,6) to (5,6) to (5,5) to (6,5) to (6,4) to (6,3) to (6,2) to (6,1) to (5,1) to (4,1) to (3,1) to (2,1).\n> \n> So the snake has a lot of turns. Head at (2,2), moving left, so it came from right, since positions show (3,2) then (2,2), so from (3,2) to (2,2) left, so current direction is left.\n> \n> Now, possible moves: since direction is left, I can move left, up, or down, but not right because of no instant reverse. So actions: L (left, same direction), U (up), D (down), but not R.\n> \n> Now, food positions: two foods.\n> \n> - (2,6) with value 1 and life span 5, so it disappears after 5 turns, including current turn? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 78, life span 5, it will disappear after turn 82? Let's see: life span N, disappears after N turns, meaning it will be there for N more turns? The description says \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So for food at (2,6,5,1), at turn 78, life span 5, so it will disappear after 5 turns, meaning at the start of turn 83, it should be gone? Countdown decreases every turn including current, so on turn 78, countdown 5; after turn 78, countdown 4; turn 79, 3; turn 80, 2; turn 81, 1; turn 82, 0 and disappears? Or after how many turns.\n> \n> \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> I think \"after N turns\" means it will be present for N turns, so at turn t, if life span is L, it will disappear at turn t + L.\n> \n> For example, at turn t, life span L, after turn t, it becomes L-1, and so on, until L=0, it disappears.\n> \n> So for turn 78, food at (2,6) has life span 5, so it will disappear after turn 82 (since after 5 turns: turn 79,80,81,82, it disappears at turn 83? Let's clarify.\n> \n> Suppose at turn t, life span N.\n> \n> After turn t, countdown decreases to N-1.\n> \n> After turn t+1, N-2, ..., after turn t+(N-1), countdown 1, after turn t+N, countdown 0 and disappears. So it is present from turn t to turn t+N-1, and disappears at turn t+N.\n> \n> \"Disappears after N turns\" might be ambiguous. But \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" suggests that on the turn it is spawned, countdown is N, and it decreases each turn, so after k turns, countdown is N-k, and when countdown reaches 0, it disappears at the end of that turn or beginning of next? The description doesn't specify, but for eating, as long as it's there when the head moves onto it, it can be eaten.\n> \n> Typically, we can assume that food is present as long as life span >0, and can be eaten on any turn where life span >=1.\n> \n> For simplicity, at turn t, if life span is L, it can be eaten on turns t, t+1, ..., t+L-1, and disappears at turn t+L.\n> \n> Similarly for the other food.\n> \n> Food at (2,6): value 1, life span 5 at turn 78. So it can be eaten from turn 78 to 82, disappears at turn 83.\n> \n> Food at (4,4): value 1, life span 8 at turn 78. So can be eaten from turn 78 to 85, disappears at turn 86.\n> \n> Both are positive food, value +1 each.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score, prioritize survival.\n> \n> First, let's map the grid to avoid walls and obstacles.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Borders are walls, so x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are all walls. Cannot move there.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (1,6), so that cell is blocked.\n> \n> Also, snake body is occupying cells, but since the snake moves, some cells might free up.\n> \n> Current snake positions: from (2,2) to (2,1) as listed.\n> \n> (2,1) is the tail?

So tail is at (2,1).\n> \n> Now, head at (2,2), moving left, so possible moves:\n> \n> - Left (L): to (1,2)\n> \n> - Up (U): to (2,3)\n> \n> - Down (D): to (2,1)\n> \n> But (2,1) is the tail. Since the tail will move when the snake moves, it might be safe to move there, as long as no collision.\n> \n> Rule: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So moving to (2,1) is possible because tail moves away.\n> \n> Now, let's check what cells are safe to move to.\n> \n> First, (1,2): is it wall or obstacle? x=1, y=2. Borders are x=0 and x=7, y=0,y=7, so (1,2) is not border. Internal obstacle at (1,6), which is different, so (1,2) should be empty? But we need to check if it's occupied by body or not.\n> \n> Current snake body: all positions are listed, (1,2) is not in the list, so it should be free, but is it within bounds? x=1, y=2, between 0 and 7, not border, not obstacle, so free.\n> \n> (2,3): not in snake positions, not wall, not obstacle, free.\n> \n> (2,1): occupied by tail, but can move there since tail moves.\n> \n> Now, moving to (2,1) is down, since head is at (2,2), down to (2,1).\n> \n> But (2,1) is tail, and after move, if I eat food or not, the tail moves, so it should be safe.\n> \n> But there is no food at (2,1), so moving there just moves the snake, no growth.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,2) and (2,3) are empty.\n> \n> Now, food locations: (2,6) and (4,4).\n> \n> (2,6) is at x=2,y=6. Is it under snake body? Let's see: in snake positions, (3,6) is a body segment, but (2,6) is not listed, so it should be free, but food is there.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,4) not in snake positions.\n> \n> But (2,6) might be under the snake? Snake has (3,6) at index 7, but (2,6) is not occupied by snake, since not in list, so food is on an empty cell.\n> \n> Similarly for (4,4).\n> \n> Now, I need to plan a sequence of actions for multiple turns.\n> \n> Think 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> First, what is the goal? To eat the positive food while avoiding risks.\n> \n> Food at (2,6) has shorter life, only 5 turns, so I might need to get it soon.\n> \n> But head at (2,2), food at (2,6), same x, different y. If I go up, from (2,2) to (2,3), then I can go up to (2,4), (2,5), (2,6) in 3 moves, but need to check if path is clear.\n> \n> From (2,2) to (2,6) directly up: cells (2,3), (2,4), (2,5) should be free? Current snake positions: (2,3) not occupied, (2,4) not, (2,5) not, (2,6) has food.\n> \n> But (3,4), (3,5), (3,6) are occupied, but not on x=2.\n> \n> So moving up to (2,3) is possible.\n> \n> But after moving, the snake body changes.\n> \n> Also, when I move to a cell, if it has food, I eat it and grow.\n> \n> Now, for (2,6), if I go directly, in 3 moves: turn 78 to (2,3), turn 79 to (2,4), turn 80 to (2,5), turn 81 to (2,6) eating food.\n> \n> But life span: at turn 78, life span 5, so it can be eaten on turn 78,79,80,81,82.\n> \n> Turn 81 is within, so yes.\n> \n> But I need to start from turn 78 action.\n> \n> Current turn 78, head at (2,2), direction left.\n> \n> If I move up to (2,3), that's one action.\n> \n> Then from there, I can continue up.\n> \n> But let's simulate the body movement.\n> \n> When I move, the head moves to new position, and the tail moves only if no food eaten; if food eaten, tail doesn't move, so snake grows.\n> \n> But here, moving to (2,3) no food, so tail moves from (2,1) to... let's see the tail.\n> \n> Snake positions: head (2,2), body: (3,2), (4,2), ..., down to tail (2,1).\n> \n> After moving head to (2,3), the new head is (2,3), and the body segments follow: the old head (2,2) becomes part of body, so new positions: head (2,3), then (2,2), then (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), etc., and tail (2,1) moves to where? Since no food eaten, the tail end is removed, so the last segment (2,1) is removed, and the new tail is the previous second last, which is (3,1)?

Or after?\n> \n> The rule says \"disappears after N turns\", but countdown decreases every turn including current.\n> \n> I think it's safer to assume that at turn t, with life span L, it can be eaten on turns t to t+L-1, and disappears at the start of turn t+L.\n> \n> For example, if L=1, it can be eaten only on turn t, disappears before turn t+1.\n> \n> Similarly, here for (2,6) at t=80, L=3, can be eaten on turn 80,81,82, disappears before turn 83.\n> \n> Similarly for others.\n> \n> (4,4) L=6, can be eaten from t=80 to 85.\n> \n> (1,4) L=9, from t=80 to 88.\n> \n> Now, back to possible moves from (2,4): U to (2,5) or L to (1,4).\n> \n> (1,4) has food, so moving L would eat it immediately.\n> \n> But we need to think long-term.\n> \n> Also, there's a risk: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> First, what is the tail? Snake positions: tail is the last segment, (4,1).\n> \n> Now, head is at (2,4), tail at (4,1), not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing an edge, so (2,4) and (4,1) are not adjacent; distance is |2-4| + |4-1| = 2+3=5, not adjacent.\n> \n> So no immediate danger from that.\n> \n> Now, let's consider the two options for turn 80.\n> \n> Option 1: Move L to (1,4), eat the food there.\n> \n> Then head moves to (1,4), which is food, so snake grows, new position: head at (1,4), and body adds a segment, so the new tail will be... after eating, the snake grows, so positions become: [(1,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1)]?

Let's think carefully.\n> \n> When snake moves: head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment in front.\n> \n> If no food eaten, tail moves away from its position.\n> \n> If food eaten, tail stays, so a new segment is added at the tail position.\n> \n> So in this case, moving to (1,4) and eating:\n> \n> - Head moves to (1,4)\n> \n> - The segment that was head (2,4) becomes body\n> \n> - All other segments shift: (2,3) moves to (2,4)?

It's turn 82. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and an internal obstacle at (1,6). So, the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), but with (1,6) blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions: The head is at (1,3), and the direction is Down. The full snake body is: [(1,3), (1,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1)]. That's 21 segments. Let me list them in order:\n> \n> - Head: (1,3)\n> \n> - Then: (1,4) — since head is at (1,3) and direction is Down, moving down would go to (1,2), but the next position is (1,4), which is up? That doesn't make sense because direction is Down.\n> \n> Snake positions are given as a list: [(x0,y0), (x1,y1), ...] with head first. So (1,3) is head, then (1,4) is the first body segment. But if the head is at (1,3) and moving Down, it should be going to lower y, so (1,2) or something. But here, the next segment is (1,4), which has higher y, meaning up. Direction is given as \"D\" for Down, but the positions suggest that from head (1,3) to (1,4) is moving up? I think I need to interpret the direction correctly.\n> \n> The head direction is the direction the snake is currently facing, which is Down. But in the positions, from (1,3) to (1,4) is an increase in y, which is upward if we consider y increasing upwards. Typically in grids, y=0 is bottom or top? The walls are given with y=0 and y=7 as borders, so let's assume y=0 is the bottom row, y=7 is top? No, walls: \"Border Cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7.\" and internal (1,6). Also, in snake positions, head at (1,3), and (1,4) which has higher y, so if y=0 is bottom, then y=4 is above y=3, so moving up? But direction is Down? Inconsistency.\n> \n> Perhaps the coordinate system: x horizontal, y vertical. Direction Down means decreasing y, so if head is at (1,3) and moving Down, it should go to (1,2). But in the list, after head (1,3), it's (1,4), which has y=4 > y=3, so that would be up, not down. Unless the snake just turned or something.\n> \n> Maybe the head direction is the direction it moved to get to the current head position. Let me read the input.\n> \n> \"Snake Head Direction: D\" and positions: head at (1,3), then segments: (1,4), (2,4), etc.\n> \n> (1,4) has same x, y+1, so if y increases up, that's north or up. But direction is Down, which is south or down.\n> \n> Perhaps the direction is the current facing direction, meaning the snake can turn. But to reach (1,3) from previous, if it came from (1,4), that would be moving down to (1,3), since y decreased from 4 to 3? Let's see the sequence.\n> \n> Positions: head (1,3), then (1,4), then (2,4), so from (1,4) to (1,3) is down (y decrease), so the head moved from (1,4) to (1,3) by moving down. So current head at (1,3), facing down, so it just moved down.\n> \n> Then the body: after head (1,3), next is (1,4), which is the segment that was head before, then (2,4), etc.\n> \n> In the list, positions are [head, segment1, segment2, ...] so segment1 is the neck, which is directly behind the head.\n> \n> So at turn 82, head is at (1,3), and it just moved down to there, so from (1,4) to (1,3), so direction Down is consistent.\n> \n> Now, food:\n> \n> - (2,6) with value 1, life span 1 (so disappears after this turn if not eaten?

So (1,6) is blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions: The head is at (1,2), and the direction is D, which is down.

Life span decreases every turn, so at turn 83, life span 9 means it has 9 turns left, including turn 83. So it will disappear after turn 91? Let's clarify: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so at turn t, if life span is N, it disappears after N-1 more turns? No.\n> \n> The description says: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So, for a food with life span L at turn t, it will disappear at turn t + L - 1? Let's think.\n> \n> If life span is N at turn t, after one turn, at t+1, life span becomes N-1. When life span reaches 0, it disappears. So, it exists for N turns: from turn t to turn t + N - 1, and disappears at turn t + N.\n> \n> For example, at turn t, life span N, it can be eaten on turn t, t+1, ..., up to turn t + N - 1. At turn t + N, it's gone.\n> \n> So for (4,4): at turn 83, life span 4, so it can be eaten on turns 83, 84, 85, 86.

Grid from x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, I think.\n> \n> Border walls: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7, so cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Playable cells: 1≤x≤6, 1≤y≤6.\n> \n> Internal obstacle: (1,6), so (1,6) is blocked.\n> \n> Snake head at (1,2), moving down: down is decreasing y, I assume?

(1,3) has higher y than (1,2), so y=3 > y=2, so y increases upward.

Walls: only border and (1,6), so (1,1) should be free.\n> \n> But y=1 is playable, since walls at y=0.\n> \n> (1,1): x=1,y=1, within 1-6, not a wall, and not in snake positions, so free.\n> \n> - Left: to (0,2) — x=0, wall, invalid.\n> \n> - Right: to (2,2) — (2,2) is occupied by a body segment. Which one? Positions: (2,2) is the 6th segment in the list, index 5 if 0-based. Head is index 0: (1,2), index 1: (1,3), index 2: (1,4), index 3: (2,4), index 4: (2,3), index 5: (2,2), etc.\n> \n> So (2,2) is not the tail; tail is (6,1). So moving to (2,2) would cause head to touch body segment, collision.\n> \n> - Up: to (1,3) — but (1,3) is occupied by the first body segment, index 1. So moving up to (1,3) would also collide.\n> \n> But direction: current head direction is D (down), and no instant reverse: cannot move opposite to current direction.\n> \n> Opposite of down is up, so cannot move up because it would be reverse.\n> \n> Possible moves: since direction is down, I can move down, left, or right, but not up.\n> \n> Left is invalid (wall), right is to (2,2) which is body, collision, down to (1,1) seems possible.\n> \n> Down to (1,1): is (1,1) free? Let's confirm.\n> \n> Grid: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n> \n> Walls: x=0,7; y=0,7; and internal (1,6).\n> \n> So (1,1) is not wall, and not in snake positions: positions start from (1,2) down to (6,1), no (1,1), so (1,1) is empty.\n> \n> Also, food at (4,4) and (1,5), not (1,1).\n> \n> So moving down to (1,1) should be safe.\n> \n> But is there a risk? Let's think about the next moves.\n> \n> I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> Also, foods: (4,4) with life span 4, so must be eaten by turn 86. (1,5) with life span 9, so more time.\n> \n> (1,5) is at (1,5), which is close to head at (1,2).\n> \n> But (1,5) might be under the snake body? Let's see.\n> \n> Snake positions: (1,4) is a segment, and (1,5)? (1,5) is not in positions, but food at (1,5), so it's not under snake, or is it?\n> \n> Food can spawn under body, but in this case, is (1,5) occupied by snake? Positions: (1,4), then (1,3), (1,2), no (1,5). (3,5) is there, but not (1,5). So (1,5) is free, food is there.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,4) is not in positions, so free.\n> \n> Now, head at (1,2), direction down.\n> \n> If I move down to (1,1), then the snake moves: head to (1,1), body follows, so tail (6,1) moves to where?

Let's count: original 21 segments. After move, head to new position, tail removed, so 20 segments? No.\n> \n> Snake has 21 segments. When it moves without eating, head to new cell, tail is removed, so length same, 21 segments but positions shift.\n> \n> After moving down to (1,1): new head (1,1), then the previous head (1,2) becomes neck, and so on, up to the previous second last segment (6,2) becomes tail, and (6,1) is removed.\n> \n> Previous positions: index 0: (1,2) head, 1: (1,3), 2: (1,4), 3: (2,4), 4: (2,3), 5: (2,2), 6: (3,2), 7: (4,2), 8: (4,3), 9: (3,3), 10: (3,4), 11: (3,5), 12: (3,6), 13: (4,6), 14: (5,6), 15: (5,5), 16: (6,5), 17: (6,4), 18: (6,3), 19: (6,2), 20: (6,1) tail.\n> \n> After moving head to (1,1): new head (1,1), then segments 0 to 19 become the body: so (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2).

So from (3,1), possible moves:\n> \n> - Up (U): to (3,2) but (3,2) is a body segment. Positions: (3,2) is in the list, yes, it's part of body. So moving to (3,2) would cause collision with body, death.\n> \n> - Down (D): to (3,0), but y=0 is wall, so collision with wall, death.\n> \n> - Right (R): to (4,1). Is (4,1) occupied? Snake positions: y=1 has (1,1),(2,1),(3,1), not (4,1). Walls: x=7 is wall, but (4,1) is within 1-6, no wall mentioned, so (4,1) should be free.\n> \n> x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, walls only at borders and (1,6).\n> \n> So (4,1) is free.\n> \n> - Left (L): but current direction is R, so L is opposite, not allowed. So only possible safe move is R to (4,1)? What about other directions?\n> \n> U to (3,2): (3,2) is body, collision.\n> \n> D to (3,0): y=0 wall.\n> \n> L to (2,1): (2,1) is body, but is it the tail? Tail is at (6,4). Moving to (2,1) would collide with body since it's not the tail.\n> \n> General rule: head touches any body segment except the tail, because when head moves to a cell, if that cell is occupied by body, it's collision unless it's the tail and the tail moves away.\n> \n> Rules: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, if head moves to tail position, it's safe because tail moves away.\n> \n> In this case, from (3,1), possible moves:\n> \n> - U to (3,2): (3,2) is not tail; tail is (6,4), so it's body, collision.\n> \n> - D to (3,0): wall, collision.\n> \n> - L to (2,1): (2,1) is body, not tail, so collision.\n> \n> - R to (4,1): free, no issue.\n> \n> So only possible move is R to (4,1).\n> \n> But that can't be right? Let me confirm the positions.\n> \n> Snake positions: head (3,1), then (2,1), (1,1), etc.\n> \n> (2,1) is the second segment, not tail. Tail is last: (6,4).\n> \n> So yes, (3,2) is occupied, (2,1) occupied, (3,0) wall, so only (4,1) is free.\n> \n> Therefore, on turn 86, I must move right to (4,1).\n> \n> But the problem is to think ahead, and there might be more.\n> \n> After moving to (4,1), what happens? Snake grows only if it eats food, which it doesn't on this move, so length same, tail moves.\n> \n> When snake moves, if no food eaten, tail moves forward, so the last segment is removed.\n> \n> Current tail is (6,4). When head moves to (4,1), the new head is (4,1), and tail should move? The snake moves: head to new position, each segment moves to the next position.\n> \n> After move, snake will be: new head (4,1), then previous head (3,1) becomes second, then (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (6,5), and tail (6,4) is removed? Positions list has 21 segments.\n> \n> After one move without eating, snake length same, tail moves off.\n> \n> So from positions: head moves to (4,1), so new positions: head (4,1), then (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), and (6,5) is now the last? Let's see: the segment that was at (6,4) is no longer part of snake; instead, the segment that was second last (6,5) becomes tail?

No.\n> \n> New head at (4,1), then the segment that was P0 moves to where P0 was? Standard: the body segment at position i moves to the position that was previously occupied by segment i-1, but it's the positions that change.\n> \n> Perhaps it's easier to simulate.\n> \n> At turn 86: positions: P0=(3,1), P1=(2,1), P2=(1,1), P3=(1,2), P4=(1,3), P5=(1,4), etc.\n> \n> After move to (4,1), new head Q0=(4,1), then Q1 = P0 = (3,1), Q2 = P1 = (2,1), Q3 = P2 = (1,1), Q4 = P3 = (1,2), Q5 = P4 = (1,3), so (1,3) is now Q5, still occupied.\n> \n> After turn 87 move to (5,1), new head R0=(5,1), R1 = Q0 = (4,1), R2 = Q1 = (3,1), R3 = Q2 = (2,1), R4 = Q3 = (1,1), R5 = Q4 = (1,2), R6 = Q5 = (1,3), so (1,3) is R6, still occupied.\n> \n> After turn 88, if move U to (5,2), new head S0=(5,2), S1 = R0 = (5,1), S2 = R1 = (4,1), S3 = R2 = (3,1), S4 = R3 = (2,1), S5 = R4 = (1,1), S6 = R5 = (1,2), S7 = R6 = (1,3), still occupied.\n> \n> And so on. The cell (1,3) will be occupied until the segment that was there is shifted out, but since the head is moving away, the position (1,3) will be occupied for a long time because the body segments are not moving from their cells yet; only when the head movement propagates.\n> \n> The position (1,3) will be vacated when the segment that is there moves to a different cell, which happens when the segment before it moves.\n> \n> For example, when the segment at (1,2) moves, then the segment at (1,3) can move to (1,2).\n> \n> But the segment at (1,2) moves when the segment at (1,1) moves, and so on.\n> \n> The first to move is the head, then the segment behind, with delay.\n> \n> In this case, since the head is moving to (5,2), the segment at (1,1) will eventually move, but it will take many turns.\n> \n> For instance, the distance from head to the segment at (1,3) is about 5 segments, so it will take about 5 moves for the movement to reach it.\n> \n> After 5 moves, the segment that was at (1,3) might be at a different position.\n> \n> But the cell (1,3) might be occupied by a different segment.\n> \n> In the short term, (1,3) remains occupied.\n> \n> Similarly for (1,5), it will be difficult to eat.\n> \n> But for long-term, I should focus on survival and try to eat (1,3) later.\n> \n> At turn 86, I must move right to (4,1).\n> \n> Then turn 87 right to (5,1).\n> \n> Then at turn 88, I can choose to go up or right.\n> \n> Going up might be better to explore the top area.\n> \n> Or going right then up.\n> \n> But since the grid is small, and snake is long, I need to avoid boxing myself in.\n> \n> For example, if I go to (6,1), then to (6,2), then I can go to (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), but (6,5) might be occupied or not.\n> \n> At turn 88, if I go to (6,1), then to (6,2), then at turn 90, head at (6,3), then I can go to (6,4), which is free, then to (6,5), which is free at that time, then to (6,6), but y=6, x=6, not wall, so (6,6) free.\n> \n> Then from (6,6), I can go down or left, but down to (6,5) body, left to (5,6), etc.\n> \n> But let's not simulate too far.\n> \n> For the action sequence, I need to provide moves for turn 86 and a few ahead, but the instruction is to think 5+ turns ahead, but the sequence can be for the next few turns.\n> \n> Answer format: \"Action Sequence (in order): Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\"\n> \n> And \"Main Thinking Conclusion\".\n> \n> For turn 86, only possible action is R.\n> \n> Turn 87, from (4,1), only possible action is R to (5,1).\n> \n> Turn 88, from (5,1), I can go U or R.\n> \n> I think going U is better to go towards the center.\n> \n> Or R to (6,1), then only U to (6,2), which is fine.\n> \n> But let's decide.\n> \n> Since there is food at (1,3) to eat later, going up might allow me to circle back.\n> \n> But with the internal wall at (1,6), it might be tricky.\n> \n> Another thing: the tail reward danger.\n> \n> For example, if head is adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it kills.\n> \n> But currently no food on tail.\n> \n> At turn 86, tail is at (6,4), no food there.\n> \n> After moves, tail moves.\n> \n> But food at (1,3) is under body, not on tail.\n> \n> So no immediate danger.\n> \n> For the sequence, I'll provide:\n> \n> Turn 86: R\n> \n> Turn 87: R\n> \n> Turn 88: U (let's say up to (5,2))\n> \n> Then from there, it depends.\n> \n> But I need to provide a sequence, perhaps for 5 turns.\n> \n> Turn 86 to 90.\n> \n> Turn 86: R to (4,1)\n> \n> Turn 87: R to (5,1)\n> \n> Turn 88: U to (5,2)  -- choose up\n> \n> Turn 89: from (5,2), I can go U to (5,3) or R to (6,2).

It's turn 87. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and one internal obstacle at (1,6). So, the playable area is from x=1 to x=6 and y=1 to y=6, except where blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions: The head is at (4,1), and it's moving right (R). The body segments are listed: [(4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (6,5)]. That's 21 segments, so the snake is quite long.\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (1,5) with value 6 and life span 1? The input says: \"(1, 5, 6, 1)\" – I think this means position (1,5), value 6, life span 1. Similarly, \"(1, 3, 8, 1)\" is position (1,3), value 8, life span 1.\n> \n> But life span 1 means it disappears after this turn or next? The rule says: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\" So for food at turn t with life span L, it will disappear after turn t + L - 1? Let's clarify.\n> \n> If life span is N, and it's present at turn t, then:\n> \n> - At turn t, life span decreases to N-1\n> \n> - After turn t + N - 1, it disappears? The countdown decreases every turn, including current. So if life span is given as L at turn t, after turn t, life span becomes L-1. It exists as long as life span > 0. So with life span 1 at turn 87, after turn 87, it decreases to 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten only on turn 87.\n> \n> Similarly for the other food.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - Food 1: (1,5) with value 6, life span 1.

Let's list all snake positions to see what cells are occupied.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (4,1), then (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (6,5).\n> \n> So (1,3) is occupied by the snake body segment. Specifically, it's the 6th segment in the list, but since head is first, it's not the tail.\n> \n> (1,5) is not in the snake positions, so it might be free, but let's confirm.\n> \n> Snake has: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), but not (1,5). Also, (1,6) is the internal obstacle, so not accessible.\n> \n> So (1,5) is empty?

Snake positions: (4,1) is head, (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), etc. (5,1) is not listed, so it should be free.\n> \n> Similarly, other directions: from (4,1), possible moves: up (U) to (4,2), down (D) to (4,0) but y=0 is wall, so invalid. Left (L) to (3,1), but that's the body segment immediately behind head, so moving left would cause collision? No, because when snake moves, the tail moves, so moving into the cell that was occupied by tail might be ok, but let's see the rules.\n> \n> Rules: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, moving to a cell that will be vacated by the tail is safe, as long as it's not occupied by other body parts.\n> \n> In this case, from head (4,1), moving left to (3,1). (3,1) is the second segment. After move, head moves to (3,1), and the tail moves, so the segment that was at (3,1) moves to where? When snake moves forward, each segment moves to the next position.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment. So if head moves to a new position, the segment that was at position 1 (just behind head) moves to where head was, and so on, and the tail segment moves away.\n> \n> Specifically: current positions: index 0: head (4,1), index 1: (3,1), index 2: (2,1), etc.\n> \n> If head moves left to (3,1), then:\n> \n> - New head position: (3,1)\n> \n> - The segment that was at index 1 (3,1) moves to where head was, (4,1)?

But old pos0 was (4,1), and new head is at (3,1), so the segment from pos1 moves to (4,1)? But (4,1) is now empty? Let's think.\n> \n> Standard: when head moves to a new cell, the body follows: the first body segment moves to where head was, second to where first was, and so on, tail moves away.\n> \n> So if head moves from (4,1) to (3,1), then:\n> \n> - New head: (3,1)\n> \n> - The segment that was at (3,1) (index 1) moves to (4,1)\n> \n> - The segment that was at (2,1) (index 2) moves to (3,1)?

But (3,1) is now head, so conflict.\n> \n> I think I have it wrong.\n> \n> In snake, when the head moves to a new cell, that cell must be free or the tail cell, but in this case, moving to (3,1) which is currently occupied by the first body segment.\n> \n> According to rules, moving into a body segment causes collision, except if it's the tail and it moves away.\n> \n> Here, (3,1) is not the tail; it's the segment right behind head.

Life span decreases every turn including current, so if life span is 5 at turn 88, it will last until turn 92? Let's clarify: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so at turn 88, life span is 5, meaning it has 5 turns left including this one. So it will be gone after turn 92. Turn 88: life=5, turn 89: life=4, turn 90: life=3, turn 91: life=2, turn 92: life=1, and on turn 93 it's gone. But it can be eaten until the turn it disappears, I assume.

List: positions are head first: index 0: (5,1), 1: (4,1), 2: (3,1), etc. So (4,1) is occupied by the body. But when I move, the snake moves, so the tail moves away, but I need to see if I collide.\n> \n> General rule: if head moves to a cell occupied by a body segment that is not the tail, it's collision. But if it moves to the tail cell, it might be ok if the tail moves.\n> \n> In this case, if I move left to (4,1), which is currently occupied by the first body segment. After move, the head goes to (4,1), and the tail moves forward, so the segment that was at (4,1) moves to the next position, but since it's a chain, when head moves left to (4,1), the body segment at (4,1) will move to where the next segment was, but it's messy.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when snake moves, head goes to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment. So if head moves to a new cell, the segment that was at position 1 moves to where head was, position 2 moves to where position 1 was, and so on, and the tail segment is removed if no food eaten, or a new segment is added if food is eaten.\n> \n> But for collision, head collides if it hits a cell that is occupied by any body segment after the move, except that if it hits the current tail cell, and the tail moves, it might not collide, but only if the tail is moving away.\n> \n> Specifically: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, moving into the tail cell is safe because the tail moves away.\n> \n> In this case, current tail is at (5,5). But if I move left to (4,1), that cell is currently occupied by the segment at index 1, which is (4,1). After move, head is at (4,1), and the segment that was at (4,1) moves to (5,1), which was the head position. So the cell (4,1) is now head, but it was previously body, but since the body segment moves away, it should be ok? No.\n> \n> At the moment of move, before the tail moves, if head moves to a cell that has a body segment, it collides, except if that body segment is the tail and it will move.\n> \n> The rule says: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> But in this case, (4,1) is not the tail; it's the second segment. Tail is at (5,5), far away.\n> \n> So if I move to (4,1), which has a body segment that is not tail, it should be collision.\n> \n> Similarly, other cells.\n> \n> So let's list possible moves from (5,1) with direction R:\n> \n> - R: to (6,1). What is at (6,1)? First, is it wall? x=7 is wall, but (6,1) is within 1 to 6, since x=7 is wall, so (6,1) is playable? Grid: walls at x=0 and x=7, so x from 1 to 6? x=0 and x=7 are walls, so cells with x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6 are playable, except internal obstacles.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (1,6), so (1,6) is blocked.\n> \n> (6,1): x=6, y=1, not wall, but is there food? Food at (6,1) is listed, with value 1.\n> \n> Also, is it occupied by snake? Snake positions: let's list all: (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5)\n> \n> So (6,1) is not in this list, so it's empty or has food. Food is at (6,1), so moving R to (6,1) would eat the food.\n> \n> - U: to (5,2). What is at (5,2)? Snake positions: (5,2) is in the list? Positions: (5,1) head, then (4,1), (3,1), etc., (4,2) is there, (3,2), (2,2), but (5,2) is not listed? Let's see: positions are: index 0: (5,1), 1: (4,1), 2: (3,1), 3: (2,1), 4: (1,1), 5: (1,2), 6: (1,3), 7: (1,4), 8: (2,4), 9: (2,3), 10: (2,2), 11: (3,2), 12: (4,2), 13: (4,3), 14: (3,3), 15: (3,4), 16: (3,5), 17: (3,6), 18: (4,6), 19: (5,6), 20: (5,5)\n> \n> So (5,2) is not occupied; it's free. But is there food? Food at (1,5), (1,3), (6,1); not at (5,2). So moving U to (5,2) is safe, no food.\n> \n> - D: to (5,0), but y=0 is wall, so invalid.\n> \n> - L: to (4,1), but (4,1) is occupied by body segment index 1, which is not tail, so collision, invalid.\n> \n> So possible moves: R to (6,1) or U to (5,2).\n> \n> Now, moving R to (6,1) would eat the food there, since it's positive food at (6,1). Value +1, snake length increases by 1.\n> \n> Moving U to (5,2) no food, just move.\n> \n> But I need to think ahead 5+ turns.\n> \n> Also, there is a special case about tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> But currently, tail is at (5,5), head at (5,1), not adjacent. Adjacent would be same row or column, distance 1. (5,1) and (5,5) are 4 apart, not adjacent.\n> \n> Now, let's look at the food:\n> \n> - Food at (1,5): life span 5, so must be eaten by turn 92 or it disappears.\n> \n> - Food at (1,3): life span 7, so by turn 94.\n> \n> - Food at (6,1): life span 10, by turn 97.\n> \n> All have value 1, so equally good.\n> \n> But (6,1) is right in front, I can eat it now by moving right.\n> \n> But if I eat it, snake grows, which might cause issues later.\n> \n> I need to simulate the moves.\n> \n> First, let's consider moving right to (6,1) and eating the food.\n> \n> Turn 88: move R to (6,1). Eat food, so snake grows. New head position (6,1), and a new segment is added at the tail. Since food eaten, after move, head is at (6,1), then the body: previous positions, but with tail extended.\n> \n> After eating, the snake gains a segment, so positions: new head (6,1), then previous head (5,1) becomes body, then (4,1), (3,1), ..., up to (5,5), and a new segment is added where the tail was? No.\n> \n> Standard: when snake moves and eats food, head moves to new cell, and a new segment is added at the previous tail position, so the tail doesn't move.\n> \n> Sequence:\n> \n> - Before move: positions S = [H, B1, B2, ..., T] with H at (5,1), T at (5,5)\n> \n> - Move R: head moves to (6,1), which has food, so food eaten.\n> \n> - Then, the body: B1 moves to where H was, B2 moves to where B1 was, ..., but since food eaten, a new segment is added at the position where T was before the move. So after move, positions: head at (6,1), then body: (5,1) (which was H), then (4,1) (B1), (3,1) (B2), ..., down to (5,5) (T), and new segment at (5,5)? No.\n> \n> The tail segment: before move, tail is at (5,5). When the snake moves, if no food, tail moves away from its position. But if food eaten, tail stays, and a new segment is added at the tail position.\n> \n> So positions after eating: head at new position (6,1), then all previous positions including the tail, so the body segments remain, and a new segment is added at the old tail position.\n> \n> So the snake becomes one segment longer.\n> \n> In this case, before move: 21 segments.\n> \n> After move to (6,1) and eat: head at (6,1), then (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5) and since food eaten, a new segment at (5,5), so the tail is now at (5,5) with an extra segment, but positions: the last segment was (5,5), new segment added at (5,5), so tail is (5,5), but the previous segment to tail was (5,6), which moved? Let's index.\n> \n> Before move: positions: 0: (5,1), 1: (4,1), 2: (3,1), 3: (2,1), 4: (1,1), 5: (1,2), 6: (1,3), 7: (1,4), 8: (2,4), 9: (2,3), 10: (2,2), 11: (3,2), 12: (4,2), 13: (4,3), 14: (3,3), 15: (3,4), 16: (3,5), 17: (3,6), 18: (4,6), 19: (5,6), 20: (5,5)\n> \n> After move right to (6,1) and eat: head moves to (6,1), so new position 0: (6,1).

Since food eaten, a new segment is added at the position where tail was, so position 21: (5,5). But the tail position is now (5,5), but it's the same cell? No, the new tail is at (5,5), but the previous segment is at (5,6), which was position 19.\n> \n> After move: the body segments shift: new segment 1: old head position (5,1), segment 2: old segment 1 position (4,1), segment 3: old segment 2 (3,1), ..., segment 20: old segment 19 position (5,6), and then since food eaten, segment 21: old tail position (5,5).\n> \n> So new positions: head (6,1), then (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5) and new tail at (5,5)?

So, coordinates range from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are at the borders, meaning I can't go to x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7. There's also an internal obstacle at (1,6).\n> \n> Snake positions are given as a list: head is (6,1), then body segments. Let me list them out:\n> \n> - Head: (6,1)\n> \n> - Body: (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5)\n> \n> That's 22 segments.

But (1,3) is also a snake body segment? Let me check the snake positions.\n> \n> Snake positions: (1,3) is in the list. Position 6 is (1,3), which is part of the body. But food can spawn under the snake body, as per the rules. So food at (1,3) is under the snake body, and it can only be eaten if the body moves away and then the head moves onto it.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (1,5) is not in the snake positions, I think. Let me confirm.\n> \n> Snake positions: (1,3) is there, (1,4) is there, (1,5) is not listed, so (1,5) is free. (1,5) is a food cell that's not occupied by snake.\n> \n> Now, (1,3) is occupied by snake body and has food with value 1, life span 6.\n> \n> But for (1,3), since it's under the body, it can only be eaten if the body moves away first.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan a sequence of actions starting from turn 89.\n> \n> First, current head position: (6,1), direction R (right). So from (6,1), moving right would go to (7,1), but x=7 is a wall, so I can't move right because that's a border wall.\n> \n> x=7 is a wall, so moving right to (7,1) is invalid, collision.\n> \n> Similarly, moving left to (5,1) is where the body is, but (5,1) is the first body segment after head. Let's see: head (6,1), next is (5,1). If I move left to (5,1), that's the neck, but in snake, moving into the neck would cause collision only if it's not the tail, but generally, moving into the cell that will be vacated is ok, but here (5,1) is occupied by body.\n> \n> Rules: body collision means head touches any body segment except that you can move into the tail segment's cell because the tail moves.\n> \n> But in this case, (5,1) is not the tail; tail is at (5,5).\n> \n> Let's list all snake positions:\n> \n> Index 0: (6,1) head\n> \n> 1: (5,1)\n> \n> 2: (4,1)\n> \n> 3: (3,1)\n> \n> 4: (2,1)\n> \n> 5: (1,1)\n> \n> 6: (1,2)\n> \n> 7: (1,3)\n> \n> 8: (1,4)\n> \n> 9: (2,4)\n> \n> 10: (2,3)\n> \n> 11: (2,2)\n> \n> 12: (3,2)\n> \n> 13: (4,2)\n> \n> 14: (4,3)\n> \n> 15: (3,3)\n> \n> 16: (3,4)\n> \n> 17: (3,5)\n> \n> 18: (3,6)\n> \n> 19: (4,6)\n> \n> 20: (5,6)\n> \n> 21: (5,5) tail\n> \n> So tail is at (5,5).\n> \n> Now, from head (6,1), possible moves:\n> \n> - Up: (6,2) - is this free?

Snake positions: (6,2) not in list, so free.\n> \n> - Down: (6,0) - but y=0 is wall, so invalid.\n> \n> - Left: (5,1) - occupied by body segment at index 1. Since it's not the tail, moving there would cause collision because head touches body. Only tail is safe to move into, but (5,1) is not tail.\n> \n> - Right: (7,1) - x=7 wall, invalid.\n> \n> So only possible move is Up to (6,2).\n> \n> But direction is R, but I can change direction? Movement constraints: I can choose U, D, L, R, but no instant reverse. Current direction R, so reverse would be L, which is left to (5,1), but that's invalid anyway because occupied.\n> \n> But Up is not reverse; reverse is only opposite direction, so L is reverse of R, which is not allowed? No instant reverse means I cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\n> \n> Current direction is R, so I cannot move L on this turn. But moving L is invalid anyway.\n> \n> Possible actions: U, D, L, R.\n> \n> But L is reverse of R, so not allowed. D is down to (6,0) wall, invalid. R to (7,1) wall, invalid. So only U is possible? But U is not reverse; it's perpendicular.\n> \n> No instant reverse only prevents moving directly opposite, so from R, I can move U or D, but not L.\n> \n> Here, D is invalid, so only U is possible.\n> \n> But let me confirm: from (6,1), moving U to (6,2) seems the only option.\n> \n> But is (6,2) safe? It's free now, but after move, the snake will move.\n> \n> Also, food: there is food at (1,5) and (1,3), but (1,3) is under body.\n> \n> Now, I need to think ahead multiple turns.\n> \n> Since only one move is possible now, I have to go Up to (6,2).\n> \n> But let's make sure.\n> \n> Current head (6,1), direction R. After moving U, the new head direction will be U.\n> \n> Then for next turn, I need to choose from there.\n> \n> But I have to plan a sequence.\n> \n> Perhaps for turn 89, I must move U.\n> \n> But let's see the food life spans.\n> \n> Food at (1,5): life span 4, so disappears after turn 89 + 3? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 89, life span 4, meaning it will be there for 4 more turns including this one? Let's read.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So at turn t, with life_span L, it disappears at turn t + L - 1? For example, if L=1, it disappears at the end of this turn, so can be eaten only this turn.\n> \n> If L=2, present at t and t+1, disappears after t+1.\n> \n> Generally, food is present from turn t to turn t + L - 1, inclusive.\n> \n> For (1,5): at turn 89, life_span 4, so present at turns 89,90,91,92. Disappears after turn 92, so not on turn 93.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,3): life_span 6, so present from 89 to 94 inclusive.\n> \n> Now, (1,3) is currently occupied by body, so to eat it, the body must move away, then head move in.\n> \n> Currently, (1,3) is position index 7.\n> \n> The snake moves: when head moves to a new cell, the tail moves away from the last cell, so each segment moves to the next position.\n> \n> When I move, head goes to new position, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment before it.\n> \n> For example, if I move head to (6,2), then new positions: head (6,2), then (6,1) becomes segment 1, (5,1) segment 2, and so on, tail (5,5) is removed, and a new tail is added, but since no food eaten, length same, so tail moves away.\n> \n> Specifically: if no food eaten, head moves to new cell, each body segment shifts forward, tail is removed.\n> \n> If food eaten, head moves to food cell, tail does not move, so snake grows.\n> \n> Now for (1,3): it's occupied by segment 7. To eat the food there, segment must move away, meaning that in some future turn, when the snake moves, that cell is vacated, then later head can move in.\n> \n> But food has limited life span.\n> \n> Similarly for (1,5), which is free now.\n> \n> But (1,5) is at (1,5), which is near the snake.\n> \n> Now back to current turn: only possible move is U to (6,2).\n> \n> Is that true? Let's list possible moves from (6,1):\n> \n> - U: (6,2) - not wall, not occupied? Snake positions: (6,2) not listed, so free.

Look at snake positions: (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), etc. (6,3) is not in the list, so it's empty. Also, not a wall. So should be safe, but need to consider if any body part is there. From list: positions are all listed, (6,3) not there, so empty.\n> \n> Similarly, move Left to (5,2): is (5,2) occupied? Snake has (5,1), (4,1), etc., but (5,2) is not in the list. Snake positions: (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), ... (5,6) at the end. (5,2) is not mentioned, so should be free.\n> \n> Confirm: the positions are: head (6,2), then (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6). So (5,2) is not in this list, and (4,2) is there, but (5,2) is different. So (5,2) is empty. Similarly, (6,3) empty.\n> \n> Now, also, (5,2) is adjacent to (4,2) which is a body segment, but when we move to (5,2), the snake will advance, head to (5,2), and tail will move from (5,6), so (4,2) will still be there, but since we're moving to (5,2), which is not occupied at that time? I need to think about the state after move.\n> \n> At the time of move, the cell we move to must not be occupied by any body part except possibly the tail, but in this case, for (5,2), it's not occupied at all, so safe.

Current turn is 90, so it has turns 90,91,92; if not eaten by turn 92, it disappears before turn 93? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 90, life span is 3, meaning after this turn, it will be 2, then after turn 91 it will be 1, after turn 92 it will be 0 and disappear. So it can be eaten on turn 90,91, or 92.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (1,3) life span 5, so after turn 90:4, 91:3, 92:2, 93:1, 94:0 disappear.

But food is at (1,3) with value 1.\n> \n> Rule about food under body: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2.

Snake positions: ... (1,4), then (2,4), (2,3), etc. (1,5) is not in the list. Positions: after (1,4) is (2,4), so (1,5) is empty? Let's list y-coordinates at x=1: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), then next is (2,4), so (1,5) is not occupied, and no wall except obstacle at (1,6), but (1,5) is fine.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (1,6), so (1,5) should be free.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,3) has food but is occupied by body.\n> \n> Food at (1,3) is under the snake, so it can be eaten only if the snake moves away from it and head comes back.\n> \n> Now, back to current move: from (6,2), I can move Up to (6,3) or Left to (5,2).\n> \n> I need to plan multiple turns ahead.\n> \n> Also, there's a risk about tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> Tail is at (5,6), which is the last segment.\n> \n> Current tail: (5,6)\n> \n> Head is at (6,2), not adjacent to tail.

The food can spawn under body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves onto it.\n> \n> Special cases: Food can spawn under snake body, but to eat it, the body must move away, then head moves on.\n> \n> Also, tail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> First, I need to plan moves for at least 5 turns ahead.\n> \n> Current head at (6,3), direction U.\n> \n> Possible actions: U, L, R (since D is opposite).\n> \n> If I go U: to (6,4)\n> \n> L: to (5,3)\n> \n> R: to (7,3) but x=7 is wall, so R to (7,3) is invalid, wall collision.\n> \n> Walls: x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are borders. So (7,3) has x=7, so wall, cannot move there.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,3) y=3, not border, but x=7 is wall.\n> \n> So from (6,3), possible moves:\n> \n> - U: (6,4) - is this free? Let's see what is at (6,4). Snake positions: head (6,3), then (6,2), (6,1), etc. No (6,4), so should be free, unless wall or obstacle.\n> \n> Walls: border x=0,7 y=0,7, internal (1,6). So (6,4) is not wall, not occupied by snake? Snake positions don't have (6,4), so yes, free.\n> \n> - L: (5,3) - is (5,3) occupied? Positions: (5,1) at index 3, (4,1), etc. (4,3) at index 16, (3,3) at 17, no (5,3), so should be free.\n> \n> - R: (7,3) x=7 wall, invalid.\n> \n> - D: opposite direction, invalid.\n> \n> So only U and L are possible moves? U to (6,4) or L to (5,3).\n> \n> But I need to think ahead.\n> \n> Also, food: (1,5) at (1,5) with life span 2. After this turn, life span decreases to 1, so if not eaten by turn 92, it disappears.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,3) at (1,3) with life span 4, decreases to 3 after this turn, must be eaten by turn 94.\n> \n> (5,4) at (5,4) with life span 10, plenty of time.\n> \n> Now, (1,3) is currently under snake body at position (1,3), which is index 9 in snake positions.\n> \n> To eat it, the body must move away, then head moves on.\n> \n> Similarly, tail reward danger: tail is at (4,6), since last position is (4,6), index 21.\n> \n> Snake positions: head (6,3), then body down to (6,1), left to (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), up to (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), then to (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6) tail.\n> \n> The tail is at (4,6).\n> \n> Head is at (6,3), not adjacent to tail. Tail at (4,6), head at (6,3), distance |6-4|=2 in x, |3-6|=3 in y, not adjacent. Adjacent would be one cell away horizontally or vertically.\n> \n> So no immediate danger.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan a sequence of moves.\n> \n> First, let's consider the food at (1,5) which has short life span. Life span 2, so after this turn (t=91), it will have life span 1, meaning it disappears after turn 92 if not eaten. So to eat it, I need to be on (1,5) on turn 91 or 92.\n> \n> But turn 91: I'm at (6,3), (1,5) is at x=1,y=5, which is far. Distance: |6-1|=5 in x, |3-5|=2 in y, min moves 7, but with obstacles, more. So impossible to reach in one turn. On turn 92, I need to be there.\n> \n> But from (6,3) to (1,5) in one move? Not possible, since max move one cell. So I cannot eat it on turn 91 or 92? On turn 91, I move to a new position, then on turn 92, I could be at (1,5) if I move towards it.\n> \n> But from (6,3), even if I go directly, it takes at least 5 moves to x and 2 to y, so 7 moves, but I have only one move for turn 91, then on turn 92 I can be closer but not at (1,5) in two moves from now.\n> \n> After turn 91 move, I am at new position on turn 92, then I can move again.\n> \n> Let's clarify the turn timing.\n> \n> Current turn is t=91. I choose an action for turn 91, which moves the head to a new cell. Then the state updates for turn 92.\n> \n> Food life span decreases at each turn, including current, so at turn 91, before I move, the food is present with life span 2. After I move (if I eat it, but I'm not on it), then after the move, life span decreases by 1, so for (1,5), after turn 91, if not eaten, life span becomes 1. Then on turn 92, if not eaten, after turn 92, it disappears.\n> \n> So to eat (1,5), I must be on (1,5) on turn 91 or turn 92.\n> \n> On turn 91: I'm at (6,3), not (1,5), so I can't eat it now.\n> \n> On turn 92: I need to move to (1,5) on turn 92 action.\n> \n> But from where? After turn 91 action, I am at some position, say P, then on turn 92, I move from P to (1,5).\n> \n> P must be adjacent to (1,5) for that.\n> \n> Adjacent cells to (1,5): (1,4), (1,6), (0,5), (2,5).\n> \n> But (0,5) x=0 wall, invalid.\n> \n> (1,6) is internal obstacle? Walls: internal obstacles (1,6), so (1,6) is wall, cannot move there.\n> \n> (1,4) is occupied by snake body? Snake positions: (1,4) is index 10, occupied.\n> \n> (2,5) is not in positions, so might be free.\n> \n> (1,4) is occupied, so not accessible.\n> \n> So adjacent cells: (1,4) snake, (1,6) wall, (0,5) wall, (2,5) free? Let's see what is at (2,5).\n> \n> Snake positions: (2,4) at 11, (2,3) at 12, (2,2) at 13, no (2,5), so (2,5) should be free.\n> \n> Also, (1,5) itself: if I were on (1,5) on turn 92, but to be on it, I need to move to it on turn 92 action.\n> \n> But for that, on turn 92, I must be on an adjacent cell and move to (1,5).\n> \n> But on turn 92, after turn 91 move.\n> \n> Currently, on turn 91, head at (6,3).\n> \n> To reach (1,5) on turn 92, I need to be at an adjacent cell on turn 92 after turn 91 move, but turn 92 position is after turn 91 move.\n> \n> Let's sequence:\n> \n> - At start of turn 91, head at (6,3), food (1,5) life span 2.\n> \n> - I choose action for turn 91, move to new head position, say H91.\n> \n> - After move, if H91 is food, eat it.

Walls: x=0,7 or y=0,7 borders, internal (1,6). So (2,5) is not wall.\n> \n> Snake occupied: positions have (2,4), (2,3), etc., no (2,5), so (2,5) is free.\n> \n> So only possible adjacent cell is (2,5).\n> \n> Therefore, to eat (1,5) on turn 92, I must be at (2,5) on turn 92 start, and move to (1,5) on turn 92 action.\n> \n> But on turn 92 start, head is at H91, which must be (2,5) for that.\n> \n> So I need to move to (2,5) on turn 91 action.\n> \n> But on turn 91, I am at (6,3), and I need to go to (2,5) in one move? Impossible, since (2,5) is not adjacent to (6,3). |6-2|=4, |3-5|=2, not adjacent.\n> \n> Therefore, it is impossible to eat (1,5) at all, because I can't reach it on turn 91 or 92 from current position.\n> \n> Since the only adjacent cell (2,5) is free, but I can't get to (2,5) in one move from (6,3).\n> \n> From (6,3), I can only go to (6,4) or (5,3), neither is (2,5).\n> \n> Even if I go to (5,3), then from there, on turn 92, I can go to (5,4), (4,3), etc., but not to (2,5) directly.\n> \n> (2,5) is two moves away min from (5,3), but turn 92 is only one move after.\n> \n> So indeed, I cannot reach (1,5) before it disappears.

After moving to (6,4), the new positions: head at (6,4), then previous head (6,3) becomes body, and tail moves, but since no food eaten, tail moves away.\n> \n> When I move without eating, the head moves to new cell, tail is removed, so the snake slides.\n> \n> Similarly, if I eat, head moves, tail stays, so length increases.\n> \n> But for now, no eat.\n> \n> So if I go U to (6,4) on turn 91, then positions: new head (6,4), body: (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), ..., and tail (4,6) is removed? Let's see the full movement.\n> \n> Current positions: [ (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6) ] 22 segments.\n> \n> If I move U to (6,4), new head (6,4), then body: (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6) and (4,6) is removed since no eat.\n> \n> After move, positions: head (6,4), then (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), ..., up to (3,6), but (4,6) was last, so it's removed, so the body is from (6,3) to (3,6) minus (4,6)? Positions: the segments from index 1 to 21 become body, but when head moves, new head added, tail removed.\n> \n> Standard snake: when moving without eating, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the next position, tail is removed.\n> \n> So from positions list, after moving to (6,4), new positions: head (6,4), then the previous positions from index 0 to 20 become the new body, so [ (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6) ] and (4,6) is gone.\n> \n> (4,6) was index 21, so removed. (3,6) is now the tail at index 20 of new list? New list: head (6,4), then (6,3) index1, (6,2) index2, ..., up to (3,6) which was index 20, now index 21 of new list?

No: new head, plus original 0 to 20, that's 22 positions, but since no eat, length should decrease? I think I'm confusing.\n> \n> Standard snake: when you move without eating, the head moves to a new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, and the tail cell is vacated.

The segment at (1,3) is index 11, so there are 12 segments after it to the tail? From head to tail: 23 segments, head index 0, tail index 22.\n> \n> Index 11 is (1,3), so to have the tail at (1,3), it would take many moves, and the food has life span only 3 turns.\n> \n> Life span 3 at turn 93, so it disappears after turn 95. We have turns 93,94,95 to eat it, but it's occupied.\n> \n> To eat it, the head must be able to move to (1,3) when it is free.\n> \n> But from the shifting, (1,3) is always occupied by some body segment until the tail passes it.\n> \n> The tail is at (3,6), which is not close to (1,3). The path from tail to (1,3) is long.\n> \n> For example, the segment at (1,3) will only be vacated when it becomes the tail and moves away.\n> \n> But index 11 is not the tail; tail is index 22.\n> \n> So the number of moves for index 11 to become the tail is when all segments after it are gone, but since we don't eat food, length doesn't change, so it takes 11 moves for that segment to become the tail? Let's see.\n> \n> Each time the snake moves, the positions shift, so the segment that was at index k will be at index k-1 after a move, but the indices change.\n> \n> After one move, the old segment 0 is gone (head moved), old segment 1 is now at position 0, old segment 2 at position 1, ..., old segment 22 at position 21, and new tail is old segment 22.\n> \n> The segment at a particular cell changes.\n> \n> For cell (1,3), it is currently occupied by segment index 11.\n> \n> After one move, as above, segment 11 moves to (1,2), and segment 12 moves to (1,3).\n> \n> After another move, segment 12 will move to the new position based on the head move, but generally, the occupant of (1,3) changes to the next segment each move.\n> \n> Specifically, after each move, the segment that was at position i moves to position i-1, so for a fixed cell, it is occupied by a sequence of segments.\n> \n> But to vacate (1,3), it needs to be the tail position, and the tail moves away.\n> \n> Currently, the tail is at (3,6). The distance from (3,6) to (1,3) is |3-1| + |6-3| = 2+3=5, but since the snake is long, it will take many moves for the tail to reach (1,3).\n> \n> The tail will only be at (1,3) when the segment that is now at (1,3) becomes the tail, which takes 11 moves because there are 11 segments after it (index 12 to 22, that's 11 segments).\n> \n> After 11 moves, the current segment at index 11 will be at the tail position.\n> \n> But after 11 moves, the food will be long gone, since life span is only 3 turns.\n> \n> Therefore, it is impossible to eat the food at (1,3) because it is under the body and will not be free before it disappears.\n> \n> Is that correct?\n> \n> Life span 3 at turn 93, so after turn 93,94,95, it's gone. Turn 93 is current, we can move on turn 93.\n> \n> But on turn 93, (1,3) is occupied, so head can't move there.\n> \n> On turn 94, after one move, (1,3) is still occupied, as we saw.\n> \n> Similarly on turn 95, same thing.\n> \n> Unless the head moves to (1,3) immediately, but it can't because it's occupied.\n> \n> The only way is if on some turn, the body moves away and head moves in, but from the shifting, when the head moves, the body shifts, so if the head moves towards (1,3), it might take multiple turns.\n> \n> For example, if I start moving left towards (1,3), but the body is in the way.\n> \n> Let's see the current position.\n> \n> Head at (5,4), food at (1,3), so to reach (1,3), I need to move left and down or something.\n> \n> From (5,4) to (1,3): delta x = -4, delta y = -1, so mostly left.\n> \n> But there are body segments in between.\n> \n> For instance, the cell to the left (4,4) is free, as we saw.\n> \n> Then from there, to (3,4), but (3,4) is occupied by index 20: (3,4) is in the list.\n> \n> List: (3,4) is position 20.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,3) is position 18, (3,3) position 19, etc.\n> \n> So the area around (1,3) is densely occupied.\n> \n> Specifically, to reach (1,3) from (5,4), I need to go through cells like (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (1,3) or something.\n> \n> But (4,4) is free, (3,4) is occupied, (2,4) occupied, (2,3) occupied, etc.\n> \n> Moreover, even if I could reach, (1,3) is occupied until the tail moves, which won't happen in time.\n> \n> Therefore, it is not feasible to eat this food. I should ignore it and focus on other things, but there is no other food listed. Only one food is given: (1,3,3,1).\n> \n> But the grid might have no other food at the moment, or perhaps I need to explore.\n> \n> The state only shows this one food, so for now, that's all.\n> \n> But life span is 3, and it's under body, so I can't eat it. So I should avoid it and plan for survival and future food.\n> \n> But no other food is mentioned, so I need to move safely to avoid dying, and wait for new food to spawn, but the problem doesn't say when new food spawns; I think we have to work with the given state.\n> \n> The input has only this food, so for now, I should just survive and not die.\n> \n> Since I can't eat this food, I need to move in a way that I don't get trapped.\n> \n> Also, there is the tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because of collision.\n> \n> But tail is at (3,6), no food there.\n> \n> So no issue.\n> \n> Now, let's think about the board.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to7, walls at borders, so playable area is x=1 to6, y=1 to6? x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x=1 to6, y=1 to6 for movement? x=0 and x=7 are walls, so we can't be at x=0 or x=7, similarly y=0 or y=7.\n> \n> So valid cells: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6?

Let's see, snake positions don't have (5,6), and no food, so yes, (5,6) is empty.\n> \n> Moving Left from (5,5) would be to (4,5). (4,5) has food! Food at (4,5), so moving left would eat it.\n> \n> Moving Right from (5,5) to (6,5). (6,5) should be empty? Snake positions: (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), but not (6,5), so yes.\n> \n> Moving Up to (5,6).\n> \n> Now, if I move Left to (4,5), I eat the food there. Since it's positive food, value +1, length increases.\n> \n> But I need to think long-term. Also, there's the food at (1,3) with short life span, only 2 turns left.\n> \n> Life span 2 at turn 94, so it will disappear after turn 95, meaning on turn 96 it's gone. So if I want to eat it, I need to do so on turn 94 or 95.\n> \n> But currently, (1,3) is occupied by snake body, so I need to move the body away first.\n> \n> The segment at (1,3) is index 12. When the snake moves, the tail moves forward, so segments shift.\n> \n> To free up (1,3), I need the snake to move so that the segment that was at (1,3) moves away.\n> \n> Since the snake moves one step each turn, the body segments follow the head.\n> \n> After one move, the head moves to a new position, and each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment in front, so the tail moves away from its current position.\n> \n> In this case, tail is at (3,5). After one move, the tail will be at (3,4) or wherever the second last segment was, but it depends.\n> \n> Specifically, for (1,3), which is occupied now, after one move, if the snake moves, the segment at (1,3) will move to where the next segment is going, but since it's a body segment, it moves to the position of the segment ahead of it when the head moves.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, the tail segment is removed if no food eaten, or if food eaten, tail stays and new segment added at head.\n> \n> But for body positions, each segment moves to the position of the previous segment in the chain.\n> \n> For example, current head at (5,5). If I move Up to (5,6), then new head (5,6), segment 1 moves to (5,5), segment 2 moves to (5,4), ..., and so on, down to the tail.\n> \n> The segment that was at position i moves to position i-1's old position? Let's think indices.\n> \n> Positions: index 0: head, 1: body, 2: body, ..., 22: tail.\n> \n> After move, new head at new position, then new position 1 is old position 0, new position 2 is old position 1, ..., new position k is old position k-1 for k=1 to len-1, and if no food eaten, the last position (old tail) is removed; if food eaten, the last position is kept and a new segment added at head position, so length increases.\n> \n> In terms of freeing a cell, if a body segment is on a cell, it will move away when the snake moves, unless it's the tail and food is eaten, but here (1,3) is not tail, it's index 12.\n> \n> So when snake moves, all body segments shift, so the cell that was occupied by a body segment might be freed if that segment moves and nothing else moves there immediately.\n> \n> Specifically for (1,3): it is currently occupied by segment 12. After one move, segment 12 will move to where segment 11 was, or to the new position based on the chain.\n> \n> Segment 11 is at (1,2), old position.\n> \n> After head moves, new position 1 is old pos 0, new pos 2 is old pos 1, ..., new pos 12 is old pos 11, which is (1,2), so segment 12 moves to (1,2), and the cell (1,3) is now empty, unless the head or something moves there, but head is elsewhere.\n> \n> Then, the food at (1,3) is now exposed and can be eaten if head moves to it.\n> \n> But only if the head moves to it after the body has moved away.\n> \n> In this case, after one move, (1,3) should be free if no one is there.\n> \n> Let's simulate one move.\n> \n> Current positions: let's list coordinates with indices for clarity.\n> \n> Index: 0: (5,5) head\n> \n> 1: (5,4)\n> \n> 2: (5,3)\n> \n> 3: (6,3)\n> \n> 4: (6,2)\n> \n> 5: (6,1)\n> \n> 6: (5,1)\n> \n> 7: (4,1)\n> \n> 8: (3,1)\n> \n> 9: (2,1)\n> \n> 10: (1,1)\n> \n> 11: (1,2)\n> \n> 12: (1,3)\n> \n> 13: (1,4)\n> \n> 14: (2,4)\n> \n> 15: (2,3)  // (2,3) is index 15\n> \n> Positions: 15 is (2,3), 16 is (2,2), etc.\n> \n> After one move, say head moves to some direction.\n> \n> Suppose head moves to (5,6) Up.\n> \n> Then new head: (5,6)\n> \n> New position 1: old head (5,5)\n> \n> New position 2: old pos 1 (5,4)\n> \n> New position 3: old pos 2 (5,3)\n> \n> New position 4: old pos 3 (6,3)\n> \n> New position 5: old pos 4 (6,2)\n> \n> New position 6: old pos 5 (6,1)\n> \n> New position 7: old pos 6 (5,1)\n> \n> New position 8: old pos 7 (4,1)\n> \n> New position 9: old pos 8 (3,1)\n> \n> New position 10: old pos 9 (2,1)\n> \n> New position 11: old pos 10 (1,1)\n> \n> New position 12: old pos 11 (1,2)  // segment 12 was at (1,3), now at (1,2)\n> \n> New position 13: old pos 12 (1,3)?

It's turn 95, and the grid is 8x8 since borders are x=0/x=7 and y=0/y=7, so cells from (0,0) to (7,7). There's an internal obstacle at (1,6).\n> \n> The snake positions are given as a list: head is at (4,5), and the body follows. The snake has 24 segments, so it's quite long. The head direction is L, which means it's moving left. Last move was left, so from (5,5) to (4,5), I assume. Positions are head first: (4,5) is head, then (5,5), (5,4), and so on.\n> \n> Food information: there's one food at (1,3) with value 1 and life span 1. That means it will disappear after this turn if not eaten now. Since life span decreases every turn including current, and it's turn 95, after this turn, if not eaten, it will be gone.\n> \n> Life span is 1, so on turn 95, it exists, and after turn 95, it disappears. So to eat it, the snake must move to (1,3) on this turn, turn 95.\n> \n> Now, the snake head is at (4,5), moving left. Current direction is L, so it came from right, meaning it can move U, D, or L, but not R because no instant reverse.

Check if (4,6) is occupied: snake positions are given, let's list all snake cells.\n> \n> Snake positions: [(4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5)]\n> \n> (3,5) is the tail?

So if not eaten on turn 95, it's gone.\n> \n> Can we eat it on turn 95? Head is at (4,5), (1,3) is not adjacent; it's several cells away. So impossible to move to (1,3) in one move from (4,5). So we cannot eat it this turn. Therefore, since life span is 1, it will disappear and not be available next turn. So we should ignore this food; it's not eatable.\n> \n> Is that right? Let me confirm.\n> \n> Head at (4,5), food at (1,3). Distance is |4-1| + |5-3| = 3 + 2 = 5 cells away, so no, cannot reach in one move. And since life span 1, after this turn, it's gone. So we cannot eat it. So no point considering it.\n> \n> Now, are there other foods? The food list only shows one: (1,3,1,1). So only this one food, and it's not eatable.\n> \n> But the snake needs to survive and eat positive food when possible.

Internal obstacle at (1,6), not (4,6). So (4,6) is empty? Is it occupied by snake? Look at snake positions: (4,6) not in list, so free.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,4): not in snake positions, not wall, so free.\n> \n> (3,5): is in snake positions, it's the tail.\n> \n> But according to rules, moving into tail is allowed if the tail moves away. Since when head moves to a cell, the tail also moves, so if head moves to tail position, and tail moves forward, it should be ok, as long as no other collision.\n> \n> Rule: \"But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So moving to (3,5) is possible, because tail will move away.\n> \n> Now, (5,5) is not allowed because reverse direction.\n> \n> So possible actions: U, D, L.\n> \n> Now, for each, need to think about future moves.\n> \n> But we need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> Also, there might be no food now, but new food could spawn? The state doesn't say anything about new food spawning; it only gives current food. But in the rules, it doesn't specify if food spawns dynamically or not. I think we have to assume that only the given food exists, and we don't know about future foods. So we should plan based on current knowledge.\n> \n> The food at (1,3) will disappear after this turn, so effectively no food.\n> \n> We need to maximize score, but with no food, we just need to survive and not die.\n> \n> But perhaps we can explore to find future food, but since no food is given, and we don't know about spawning, I think we should focus on survival and positioning for potential food.\n> \n> The problem says \"maximize score by eating positive food\", but if no food, just avoid death.\n> \n> Also, long-term survival.\n> \n> Now, let's see the current situation.\n> \n> Snake is long, 24 segments, in a 8x8 grid, which has 64 cells, so snake occupies 24, walls: borders take, let's calculate free cells.\n> \n> Grid 8x8 = 64 cells.\n> \n> Borders: x=0 and x=7 are walls, each has 8 cells, so 16 cells. Similarly y=0 and y=7, but corners are shared, so total border walls: top and bottom rows y=0 and y=7, each 8 cells, left and right columns x=0 and x=7, minus corners counted twice, so 2*8 + 2*8 - 4 = 16 + 16 - 4 = 28? No.\n> \n> Cells: for x=0, all y from 0 to 7, that's 8 cells.\n> \n> x=7, all y from 0 to 7, 8 cells.\n> \n> y=0, all x from 0 to 7, but x=0 and x=7 already included, so for y=0, it's the bottom row, but x=0,y=0 and x=7,y=0 are corners, already in x=0 and x=7.\n> \n> Better: the four corners: (0,0), (0,7), (7,0), (7,7)\n> \n> Then edges: top row y=7, x=1 to 6: 6 cells\n> \n> Bottom row y=0, x=1 to 6: 6 cells\n> \n> Left column x=0, y=1 to 6: 6 cells (y=0 and y=7 corners)\n> \n> Right column x=7, y=1 to 6: 6 cells\n> \n> Plus internal obstacle at (1,6)\n> \n> So total wall cells: corners 4 + top edge 6 + bottom edge 6 + left edge 6 + right edge 6 + internal (1,6) = 4+6+6+6+6+1 = let's add: 4+1=5, 6*4=24, total 29 walls.\n> \n> Grid 64 cells, walls 29, snake 24 segments, but snake segments include the cells they occupy, so free cells: 64 - 29 walls - 24 snake?

No.\n> \n> In snake game, when no food eaten, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position, so the last segment (tail) is removed, so length decreases? No, I think I have confusion.\n> \n> Core rule: when snake moves without eating food, it moves forward, so head to new cell, each body segment to the position of the previous segment, and the tail cell is vacated. So the snake length remains the same, but the tail moves.\n> \n> For example, positions [A,B,C,D] with A head, D tail.\n> \n> Move head to new E, then new positions [E,A,B,C], D is removed, so length same, but tail was D, now C is tail.\n> \n> In this case, snake has 24 segments.

The previous plan at Turn 95 was to move **U (Up)** to (4,6), and the next action in the sequence at Turn 96 is **R (Right)** to (5,6). \n\nHere’s the reasoning:\n1. **Current State**: The snake's head is at (4,6) (after moving U at Turn 95), and the direction is now **U (Up)**. The only valid moves from (4,6) are **L (Left)** to (3,6) or **R (Right)** to (5,6), as moving **U** would hit the wall at (4,7) and **D** would reverse direction (invalid).\n2. **Plan Continuation**: The previous plan aimed to move right to (5,6) to explore the open area at y=6 for survival. This avoids immediate collisions and aligns with the long-term strategy of maximizing space.\n3. **No Food Considerations**: The food at (1,3) has expired (lifespan 1, now Turn 96), and no other food is present. The focus is purely on survival.\n\n### Action for Turn \\( t_0 = 96 \\):\n\\boxed{R}  \n\n### Additional Notes:\n- The next actions in the sequence (Turns 97–99) would be **R**, **D**, **D** to continue navigating the open area, but these are not required for the current turn's output.\n- Moving **R** to (5,6) is safe: (5,6) is not occupied by the snake or walls, and the tail will move forward, preventing collisions.",

There's an internal obstacle at (1,6).\n> \n> The snake positions are given as a list: head is at (4,5), and the body follows. The snake has 24 segments, so it's quite long. The head direction is L, which means it's moving left. Last move was left, so from (5,5) to (4,5), I assume. Positions are head first: (4,5) is head, then (5,5), (5,4), and so on.\n> \n> Food information: there's one food at (1,3) with value 1 and life span 1.

Here, no food to eat immediately.\n> \n> But we need to think 5+ turns ahead for long-term survival.\n> \n> First, let's map the grid to visualize.\n> \n> Grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7). Walls: borders, so x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Also internal obstacle at (1,6).\n> \n> Snake positions: let's plot them.\n> \n> I should list all occupied cells by snake.\n> \n> From the list:\n> \n> (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5)\n> \n> Now, let's see the shape.

Internal obstacle at (1,6), not (4,6). So (4,6) is empty? Is it occupied by snake? Look at snake positions: (4,6) not in list, so free.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,4): not in snake positions, not wall, so free.\n> \n> (3,5): is in snake positions, it's the tail.\n> \n> But according to rules, moving into tail is allowed if the tail moves away.

The state doesn't say anything about new food spawning; it only gives current food. But in the rules, it doesn't specify if food spawns dynamically or not. I think we have to assume that only the given food exists, and we don't know about future foods. So we should plan based on current knowledge.\n> \n> The food at (1,3) will disappear after this turn, so effectively no food.\n> \n> We need to maximize score, but with no food, we just need to survive and not die.\n> \n> But perhaps we can explore to find future food, but since no food is given, and we don't know about spawning, I think we should focus on survival and positioning for potential food.\n> \n> The problem says \"maximize score by eating positive food\", but if no food, just avoid death.\n> \n> Also, long-term survival.\n> \n> Now, let's see the current situation.\n> \n> Snake is long, 24 segments, in a 8x8 grid, which has 64 cells, so snake occupies 24, walls: borders take, let's calculate free cells.\n> \n> Grid 8x8 = 64 cells.\n> \n> Borders: x=0 and x=7 are walls, each has 8 cells, so 16 cells. Similarly y=0 and y=7, but corners are shared, so total border walls: top and bottom rows y=0 and y=7, each 8 cells, left and right columns x=0 and x=7, minus corners counted twice, so 2*8 + 2*8 - 4 = 16 + 16 - 4 = 28? No.\n> \n> Cells: for x=0, all y from 0 to 7, that's 8 cells.\n> \n> x=7, all y from 0 to 7, 8 cells.\n> \n> y=0, all x from 0 to 7, but x=0 and x=7 already included, so for y=0, it's the bottom row, but x=0,y=0 and x=7,y=0 are corners, already in x=0 and x=7.\n> \n> Better: the four corners: (0,0), (0,7), (7,0), (7,7)\n> \n> Then edges: top row y=7, x=1 to 6: 6 cells\n> \n> Bottom row y=0, x=1 to 6: 6 cells\n> \n> Left column x=0, y=1 to 6: 6 cells (y=0 and y=7 corners)\n> \n> Right column x=7, y=1 to 6: 6 cells\n> \n> Plus internal obstacle at (1,6)\n> \n> So total wall cells: corners 4 + top edge 6 + bottom edge 6 + left edge 6 + right edge 6 + internal (1,6) = 4+6+6+6+6+1 = let's add: 4+1=5, 6*4=24, total 29 walls.\n> \n> Grid 64 cells, walls 29, snake 24 segments, but snake segments include the cells they occupy, so free cells: 64 - 29 walls - 24 snake? But walls and snake are separate, but walls are not occupied by snake, so total free cells: 64 - 29 - 24 = 64 - 53 = 11 free cells.\n> \n> 64 - 29 = 35, minus 24 snake = 11 free cells. Yes.\n> \n> Among these, one is food at (1,3), but it's under snake, so not free for movement, but it will disappear.\n> \n> Free cells are those not wall and not snake.\n> \n> List free cells.\n> \n> Grid rows y=0 to 7, columns x=0 to 7.\n> \n> y=0: all wall\n> \n> y=7: all wall\n> \n> x=0: all wall\n> \n> x=7: all wall\n> \n> For y=1 to 6, x=1 to 6 are possible, except walls.\n> \n> Internal walls only at borders except the internal obstacle.\n> \n> Borders are full rows/columns.\n> \n> So for y=1 to 6, x=1 to 6: 6x6=36 cells possible, but minus walls.\n> \n> Walls: borders are not in this, borders are outside or on edge.\n> \n> The playable area is x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6?

Standard snake movement: when head moves to new cell, all body segments move forward, so the tail cell is vacated.\n> \n> So new positions: [ (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4) ] and the tail (3,5) is gone, so the snake has 24 segments, after moving without eating, length same, tail removed.\n> \n> Positions: originally 24 segments. After move, head to new position, and tail is removed, so new snake has 23 segments? No.\n> \n> In snake game, when no food eaten, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position, so the last segment (tail) is removed, so length decreases? No, I think I have confusion.\n> \n> Core rule: when snake moves without eating food, it moves forward, so head to new cell, each body segment to the position of the previous segment, and the tail cell is vacated. So the snake length remains the same, but the tail moves.\n> \n> For example, positions [A,B,C,D] with A head, D tail.\n> \n> Move head to new E, then new positions [E,A,B,C], D is removed, so length same, but tail was D, now C is tail.\n> \n> In this case, snake has 24 segments.

Snake positions update: new head (6,6), then the body: previous head (5,6) becomes body, so positions: [(6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3)] and tail (3,3) is gone? Positions: after move, the snake moves: head to new position, each segment moves to previous position of the one before, so tail is removed unless eating.\n> \n> Since not eating, tail (3,3) is removed, and new positions are: head (6,6), then (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3) — (4,3) was before (3,3)?

Previous seg22 was (4,3), and prev seg23 (3,3) is gone, so the new snake has 24 segments? No.\n> \n> Original snake had 24 positions. After moving, head moves to new cell, tail is removed, so new snake has same length, 24 segments? Let's see: new head at (6,6), and the last segment is the one that was second last, but since tail is removed, the new tail is the previous position of the second last segment.\n> \n> Standard: when snake moves without eating, head to new position, each body segment moves to previous position of the segment before it, so the tail position is vacated.\n> \n> Number of segments remains the same unless eating.\n> \n> In this case, not eating, so still 24 segments.\n> \n> Original positions: 24 cells.\n> \n> After move: new head (6,6), then the body: position 1 becomes (5,6) (old head), position 2 becomes (4,6) (old position 1), ..., up to position 23 becomes (4,3) (old position 22), and old position 23 (3,3) is no longer part of snake, so new positions are from (6,6) down to (4,3), with (4,3) as tail.\n> \n> The list has indices 0 to 23, 24 positions.\n> \n> After move, new index 0: (6,6), index 1: old index 0 (5,6), index 2: old index 1 (4,6), index 3: old index 2 (4,5), index 4: old index 3 (5,5), ..., index 22: old index 21 (4,2), index 23: old index 22 (4,3).

It's turn 99. The grid has walls at the borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and an internal obstacle at (1,6). So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are on the borders, meaning cells like (0,y) for all y, (7,y) for all y, (x,0) for all x, and (x,7) for all x. Also, (1,6) is blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions: Head at (6,5), with direction D (down). The positions are given as a list: [(6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2)]. Let me plot this to visualize.\n> \n> Head: (6,5) direction down. So moving down would go to (6,4), but let's see the direction.\n> \n> Current head direction is D, so from (6,5), moving D would be to (6,4).\n> \n> But let's list all positions in order:\n> \n> Index 0: head (6,5)\n> \n> Index 1: (6,6) – this is above, so since head is at (6,5) and direction is D, (6,6) must be the body segment behind. Direction D means down, so if head is moving down, the next segment should be where it came from, which is up. From (6,5) to (6,6) is up, but direction is down? Inconsistency.\n> \n> Snake positions: [(6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), ...]\n> \n> If head is at (6,5) and moving down, but the next position is (6,6), which is north, so that means the snake was moving up to get to (6,5), but the head direction is given as D. Head direction is the current moving direction.\n> \n> Perhaps I need to interpret the positions. The list is head first, so position 0 is head, position 1 is the first body segment, and so on, to the tail.\n> \n> At turn t, snake is at positions S[0] to S[23], with S[0] being head.\n> \n> Head direction is D, meaning it is currently moving downward. So from the previous state, it must have moved down to reach (6,5).\n> \n> But in the positions, S[1] is (6,6), which is directly above (6,5), so that makes sense; the head moved down to (6,5), so the segment behind is at (6,6).\n> \n> Then S[2] is (5,6), which is left of (6,6), so from (6,6) to (5,6) is left.\n> \n> S[3] is (4,6), left again.\n> \n> S[4] is (4,5), down from (4,6).\n> \n> S[5] is (5,5), right from (4,5)? (4,5) to (5,5) is right.\n> \n> S[6] is (5,4), down from (5,5).\n> \n> S[7] is (5,3), down again.\n> \n> S[8] is (6,3), right from (5,3).\n> \n> S[9] is (6,2), down from (6,3)? (6,3) to (6,2) is down.\n> \n> y=2 is south if y increases up? Typically in grids, y=0 is bottom or top? I need to define coordinates.\n> \n> The walls: border cells x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7. And internal obstacle (1,6).\n> \n> In the food, it's given as (3,5,8,1), which I think is (x,y, life_span, value), so (3,5) with life_span 8, value 1 (positive food).\n> \n> Value 1 means +1, positive food.\n> \n> Life_span 8, so it disappears after 8 turns, including current turn? Countdown decreases every turn, including current.\n> \n> Current turn t=99, so food at (3,5) has life_span 8, so it will disappear at turn 99 + 8 - 1? Let's see: life_span N, disappears after N turns, countdown decreases each turn including current.\n> \n> So at turn t, if life_span is L, after L turns it will be gone. So for example, at turn t, countdown = L, at turn t+1, countdown L-1, ..., at turn t + L - 1, countdown 1, at turn t + L, it disappears, so it can be eaten only on turns t to t+L-1.\n> \n> Here, turn 99, life_span 8, so countdown 8, can be eaten on turns 99 to 106 (since after 8 turns, on turn 107 it disappears).\n> \n> Turn 99: countdown 8\n> \n> Turn 100: countdown 7\n> \n> ...\n> \n> Turn 106: countdown 1\n> \n> Turn 107: gone, not eatable.\n> \n> But we're at turn 99, so we can eat it from turn 99 to 106.\n> \n> Now, back to snake positions.

The only safe immediate move is down to (6,4), as:\n> - Moving up (U) is opposite to current direction and disallowed.\n> - Moving left (L) to (5,5) causes body collision (segment at index 5).\n> - Moving right (R) to (7,5) causes wall collision (x=7 border).\n> - **After Move to (6,4)**:\n> - Head moves to (6,4) with direction D.\n> - Snake body shifts, occupying cells around (6,4): (6,5) above (segment 1), (6,3) below (segment 9), and (5,4) left (segment 7). All adjacent cells are blocked, and moving in any direction at turn 100 causes collision or is invalid (U opposite, D/L occupied, R wall).\n> - **Consequence**: Moving down at turn 99 leads to inevitable death at turn 100 due to no escape. The food at (3,5) (value +1, life span 8, eatable until turn 106) is inaccessible from this position, as the snake is trapped and cannot reach it in time.\n> - **Long-Term Consideration**: Thinking 5+ turns ahead (turns 100-104+) is impossible here, as the snake dies at turn 100. No sequence can access the food or avoid death. Survival is prioritized, but no safe long-term path exists.\n> \n> ### Action Sequence\n> \\boxed{\n> Turn 99: D\n> }\n> \n> ### Main Thinking Conclusion\n> The only safe immediate move is down to avoid collision, but it traps the snake with no escape on the next turn, demonstrating a critical positional disadvantage where long-term survival and food access are impossible.\n",
