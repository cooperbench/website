        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn t1 = 0.\n\nThe grid has walls: border cells meaning x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are all walls. So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), but the borders are walls, so the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think? Let me confirm.\n\nBorder cells: x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7. So yes, the outer edges are walls. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (4,6).\n\nSnake positions: only one segment at (3,3). That means the snake is of length 1, just the head. Since head direction is given as L (left), but with only one segment, direction might not matter much yet, but it affects the no instant reverse rule.\n\nFood positions:\n\n- (1,2) with value 1, life span 10\n\n- (3,5) with value 1, life span 10\n\n- (2,2) with value 1, life span 10\n\nAll food is positive, value 1, and life span 10. Since it's turn 0, life span decreases each turn, so they'll disappear after 10 turns if not eaten.\n\nNow, since the snake is only one segment, there's no body to collide with, except walls. Also, tail reward danger isn't an issue yet because there's no tail.\n\nI need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score, prioritizing long-term survival.\n\nFirst, let's sketch the grid. Playable area: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, but with obstacle at (4,6).\n\n(4,6) is within 1 to 6 in both, so it's an internal wall.\n\nCurrent snake head at (3,3), facing left.\n\nPossible moves: U (up, to (3,4)), D (down, to (3,2)), L (left, to (2,3)) or R (right, to (4,3)).\n\nSince head direction is L, moving left is fine, moving right would be instant reverse, which is not allowed. No instant reverse means I can't move in the opposite direction immediately. Current direction is L, so opposite is R. So I cannot move right on this turn.\n\nAllowed moves: U, D, L. Not R.\n\nNow, food locations: (1,2), (2,2), (3,5)\n\n(1,2) is left and down from (3,3), (2,2) is left and down, (3,5) is up from (3,3).\n\nSince snake is length 1, eating food will increase length to 2, so after eating, there will be a body segment.\n\nI need to plan a path to eat food while avoiding dead ends or traps.\n\nFirst, let's consider the food at (2,2). It's close: from (3,3), moving left to (2,3) then down to (2,2)? From (3,3), I can move directly down to (3,2), but (3,2) has no food. (2,2) is at (2,2), so from (3,3), to reach (2,2), I need to go left then down, or down then left, but not directly adjacent in one move unless diagonal, but moves are only orthogonal.\n\n(2,2) is adjacent? Let's see distances:\n\nFrom (3,3) to (2,2): Δx = -1, Δy = -1, so not adjacent; it's diagonal. Adjacent means sharing a side, so only horizontal or vertical neighbors.\n\nSo (3,3) has neighbors: (3,4) up, (3,2) down, (2,3) left, (4,3) right.\n\n(2,2) is not directly adjacent to (3,3); it's at (2,2), which is adjacent to (2,3), (2,1), (1,2), (3,2), etc.\n\nSimilarly, (1,2) is at (1,2), adjacent to (1,1), (1,3), (0,2) but (0,2) is wall, (2,2).\n\n(3,5) is at (3,5), which is adjacent to (3,4), (3,6), (2,5), (4,5).\n\n(3,6) might be out? y=6 is border? Border walls at y=0 and y=7, so y=6 is playable? y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y from 1 to 6 are playable, since y=0 and y=7 are walls.\n\nSimilarly x from 1 to 6.\n\nSo (3,5) is at (3,5), neighbors: (3,4) down, (3,6) up, (2,5) left, (4,5) right.\n\nBut (3,6) is playable? y=6, since y=7 is wall, y=6 should be playable. But there's an internal obstacle at (4,6), which is different.\n\n(4,6) is a wall cell, so (4,6) is blocked.\n\n(3,6) should be free, unless it's wall, but walls are only borders and internal obstacles specified. Borders are x=0,x=7,y=0,y=7, and internal obstacle (4,6).\n\nSo (3,6) is free.\n\nBack to food.\n\nFood at (1,2): position (1,2), value 1\n\n(2,2): (2,2), value 1\n\n(3,5): (3,5), value 1\n\nAll with life span 10.\n\nNow, to eat (2,2), I need to be at (2,2). From current position (3,3), I can move to (2,3) first, then from there to (2,2). (2,3) to (2,2) is down.\n\nSimilarly, to eat (1,2), from (2,2) or from (1,1) or (1,3), but (1,3) might be possible.\n\nTo eat (3,5), from (3,4), (3,6), (2,5), or (4,5).\n\nSince I need to think ahead, let's consider options for this turn.\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L (since R is reverse and not allowed)\n\nMove U (up) to (3,4): then at (3,4), which has no food. From there, I can go to (3,5) to eat the food, but (3,5) is food, so moving to (3,5) would eat it.\n\n(3,4) to (3,5) is up, to (3,5).\n\nSimilarly, move D (down) to (3,2): no food there.\n\nMove L (left) to (2,3): no food there.\n\nIf I move U to (3,4), then next turn I can move U to (3,5) to eat the food at (3,5).\n\nSimilarly, if I move L to (2,3), then I can move D to (2,2) to eat food at (2,2).\n\n(2,2) is food, so moving to (2,2) eats it.\n\nNow, eating food increases length by 1, so after eating, snake has two segments: head and tail.\n\nFor example, if I eat at (3,5), from (3,4) moving to (3,5), then new head at (3,5), tail at previous head, which was (3,4), so positions: [(3,5), (3,4)]\n\nSimilarly, if I eat at (2,2) from (2,3) moving down to (2,2), positions: [(2,2), (2,3)]\n\nNow, after eating, I need to avoid colliding with body or walls.\n\nAlso, tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it kills. But since food is only on the grid, not on the snake, and when you eat, the food disappears and snake grows, so the tail segment doesn't have food; food is separate.\n\nTail reward danger is when the food is on the tail cell, and head moves to it. But in this case, after eating, the tail is just body, no food.\n\nThe rule: \"If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake\"\n\nBut the food is on the grid cell, not on the snake. So if there is food on the tail cell, and head moves to it, it might cause collision because after eating, the tail doesn't move away, and new tail is added, so head and tail collide.\n\nBut in this initial state, no food on snake cells.\n\nCurrently, all food is free.\n\nNow, for long-term, I should consider which food to go for first.\n\n(3,5) is directly above, and I can reach it in two moves: this turn move U to (3,4), next turn move U to (3,5) to eat.\n\nSimilarly, (2,2) can be reached in two moves: this turn move L to (2,3), next turn move D to (2,2) to eat.\n\n(1,2) is farther; from (3,3), it would take more moves.\n\n(1,2) can be reached via (2,2) or directly.\n\nBut (1,2) is near the border, x=1, y=2, so x=1 is not wall, but adjacent to x=0 wall, so it's a bit constrained.\n\nSimilarly, (3,5) is at y=5, near y=6, but y=6 is playable.\n\nAlso, internal obstacle at (4,6), which might affect paths.\n\nSince life span is 10, all food has time, so I can go for the closest or plan a route to get multiple.\n\nBut snake is short now, so low risk.\n\nAnother thing: after eating, the snake grows, so I need to be careful not to trap myself.\n\nFor example, if I go to (3,5) and eat, I'm at (3,5) with tail at (3,4). Then I need to move somewhere.\n\nPossible moves from (3,5): U to (3,6), D to (3,4) but (3,4) is body, so cannot move there, collision; L to (2,5), R to (4,5).\n\n(3,4) is body, so moving down to (3,4) would collide with body.\n\nSo from (3,5), after eating, positions: head (3,5), body (3,4)\n\nThen moves: U to (3,6), L to (2,5), R to (4,5). Down to (3,4) is invalid.\n\nNow, (3,6) is free, (2,5) free, (4,5) free.\n\nBut (4,5) is near the obstacle? Obstacle at (4,6), so (4,5) is free.\n\nSimilarly, if I go to (2,2) and eat, head at (2,2), tail at (2,3).\n\nMoves from (2,2): U to (2,3) but (2,3) is body, cannot; D to (2,1), L to (1,2) which has food, R to (3,2).\n\n(2,3) is body, so up is invalid.\n\nDown to (2,1), left to (1,2) which is food, right to (3,2).\n\nNow, back to turn 0.\n\nOption 1: Move U to (3,4)\n\nThen turn 1: at (3,4), can move U to (3,5) to eat food.\n\nAfter eating, at turn 2, head (3,5), body (3,4), direction U (since moved up).\n\nThen possible moves: U to (3,6), L to (2,5), R to (4,5)\n\nNow, no food at (3,6) or (2,5) or (4,5), but there is food at (1,2) and (2,2).\n\n(2,2) is at (2,2), which is down and left.\n\nFrom (3,5), I can go left to (2,5), then down to (2,4), etc., towards (2,2).\n\nSimilarly, (1,2) is farther.\n\nAfter eating (3,5), the food is gone, so only (1,2) and (2,2) left.\n\nLife span decreases, but 10 turns, plenty.\n\nOption 2: Move L to (2,3)\n\nThen turn 1: at (2,3), can move D to (2,2) to eat food at (2,2).\n\nAfter eating, head (2,2), body (2,3), direction D (down).\n\nThen moves: D to (2,1), L to (1,2) which has food, R to (3,2)\n\nCannot go up to (2,3) body.\n\nNow, if I go to (1,2), I can eat it immediately if I move left.\n\nBut (1,2) has food, so moving to (1,2) eats it.\n\nThen snake grows to length 3.\n\nBut let's think long-term.\n\nAlso, there is tail reward danger potential.\n\nFor example, after eating (2,2), head at (2,2), tail at (2,3), and (2,3) has no food, but if there were food on (2,3), but it doesn't, food is at (1,2) and (3,5).\n\n(1,2) is adjacent to (2,2)? (2,2) and (1,2) are adjacent horizontally.\n\nSo from (2,2), moving left to (1,2) would eat the food at (1,2).\n\nThen new head at (1,2), new tail... positions: before move, head (2,2), body (2,3)\n\nAfter moving left to (1,2), head moves to (1,2), eats food, so snake grows, so the body includes the previous head and tail.\n\nSo new positions: head (1,2), then body segments: (2,2) and (2,3). So length 3.\n\nNow, the tail is at (2,3).\n\nIs there any danger? Head at (1,2), tail at (2,3). They are adjacent? (1,2) and (2,3) are not adjacent; adjacent would be same row or column, adjacent cells.\n\n(1,2) neighbors: (1,1), (1,3), (0,2) wall, (2,2)\n\n(2,2) is a body segment now, since head is at (1,2), body at (2,2) and (2,3).\n\nSo from (1,2), possible moves: down to (1,1), up to (1,3), left to (0,2) wall—invalid, right to (2,2) but (2,2) is body, collision.\n\nSo only moves: D to (1,1) or U to (1,3).\n\n(1,1) is bottom-left corner, might be risky.\n\n(1,3) is up.\n\nBut no food left except (3,5), which is far.\n\nFood at (3,5) is still there.\n\nIn this path, if I eat (2,2) and then (1,2), I have a snake of length 3 in the corner, which might be hard to get out to reach (3,5).\n\nSimilarly, if I go for (3,5) first, I'm near the top.\n\nNow, compare the food values: all same, +1.\n\nBut (3,5) might be better because it's not near border, and I can access more area.\n\n(2,2) is near border and corner.\n\nAlso, internal obstacle at (4,6), which might affect movement in that area.\n\nLet's list all free cells to see available space.\n\nGrid: x 1-6, y 1-6, minus walls.\n\nWalls: borders x=0,7 y=0,7, and internal (4,6).\n\nSo free cells: all (x,y) with 1≤x≤6, 1≤y≤6 except (4,6) is wall.\n\n(4,6) is occupied by wall, so not accessible.\n\nNow, snake at (3,3).\n\nFood at (1,2), (2,2), (3,5).\n\n(2,2) and (1,2) are both at y=2, x=1 and 2.\n\n(3,5) at x=3,y=5.\n\nIf I go for (3,5) first: move U to (3,4) at turn 0.\n\nTurn 1: move U to (3,5) eat, now positions: [(3,5), (3,4)] head at (3,5), direction U.\n\nTurn 2: I need to move, say to (3,6) or (2,5) or (4,5).\n\n(3,6) is at y=6, which is near top border y=7 wall.\n\n(2,5) or (4,5).\n\nFood left: (1,2) and (2,2).\n\nI can go towards them, say move L to (2,5) at turn 2.\n\nThen at (2,5), direction L.\n\nPossible moves: U to (2,6), D to (2,4), L to (1,5), R to (3,5) but (3,5) is body? Positions: head was at (3,5), moved to (2,5), so new head (2,5), body (3,5) and (3,4).\n\n(3,5) is body, so moving right to (3,5) would collide.\n\nSimilarly, from (2,5), moves: U (2,6), D (2,4), L (1,5), R (3,5) but invalid, so only U, D, L.\n\n(2,6) is top row, (2,4) down, (1,5) left.\n\nFood at (1,2) and (2,2) are south-west.\n\nSo I can move D to (2,4), for example.\n\nThen from (2,4), to (2,3), then to (2,2) to eat.\n\n(2,2) has food, so yes.\n\nBut (2,2) will be eaten when I reach it.\n\nSimilarly, (1,2) is there.\n\nBut let's see if I can get both.\n\nAfter eating (3,5), if I go to (2,5) then (2,4) then (2,3), then at (2,3), I can move to (2,2) to eat.\n\nBut (2,3) is not food, so move to (2,2) to eat at turn, say, turn 4 or something.\n\nTurn 0: move U to (3,4)\n\nTurn 1: move U to (3,5) eat, length 2\n\nTurn 2: move L to (2,5)  // from (3,5) to (2,5)\n\nTurn 3: move D to (2,4)\n\nTurn 4: move D to (2,3)  // (2,4) to (2,3)\n\nTurn 5: move D to (2,2) eat, now length 3\n\nThen at (2,2), with body at (2,3) and (2,4)? Positions: before move to (2,2), head at (2,3), body (2,4) and (2,5)? Let's track.\n\nAfter turn 4: at turn 4, head moved to (2,3), so positions: head (2,3), body (2,4) and (2,5)? No.\n\nStart: after turn 1: head (3,5), body (3,4)\n\nTurn 2: move L to (2,5), new head (2,5), body: previous head (3,5) and since ate at turn 1, body was (3,4), but when moving, the tail moves forward? No.\n\nSnake movement: when moving, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, and if food eaten, a new segment is added at the tail position.\n\nStandard snake: when no food eaten, head moves, tail moves forward, so length same. When food eaten, head moves to food, tail doesn't move, new segment added at tail, so length increases.\n\nIn this case, when eating, tail doesn't move.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nTurn 0: start at (3,3), move U to (3,4) — no food, so positions: now [(3,4)] since length 1, just head moves.\n\nSnake positions: initially [(3,3)], after move U to (3,4), new position [(3,4)].\n\nTurn 1: move U to (3,5), which has food, so eat: head moves to (3,5), and since food eaten, tail doesn't move, new segment added, so positions: head (3,5), body (3,4) — so [(3,5), (3,4)]\n\nTurn 2: move L to (2,5), no food at (2,5), so head moves to (2,5), body moves: the segment at (3,4) moves to previous head position (3,5)? No.\n\nBody segments follow: the body segment that was at (3,4) moves to where the head was, which is (3,5). But head is moving to (2,5), so the body segment at (3,4) moves to (3,5), and since no food, tail is removed? No.\n\nWhen no food eaten, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment ahead of it, and the tail segment is removed, but since we have only one body segment, it moves to the previous head position.\n\nStandard: positions list: [head, segment1, segment2, ..., tail]\n\nWhen moving to a new cell without food: new head at new position, segment1 moves to old head position, segment2 to old segment1, ..., tail is removed from the end.\n\nBut since we add a new head, and shift, the last position is abandoned.\n\nWith food eaten, no tail removal, new head added, and positions shift, new tail added at the end.\n\nEasier with list.\n\nAfter turn 1: positions [(3,5), (3,4)]  head (3,5), tail (3,4)\n\nTurn 2: move to (2,5), no food. So head moves to (2,5), the body segment (3,4) moves to where the head was, (3,5), so new positions: [(2,5), (3,5)]  head (2,5), tail (3,5)\n\n(3,4) is gone.\n\nThen turn 3: move D to (2,4), no food. Head to (2,4), body (3,5) moves to previous head (2,5), so positions [(2,4), (2,5)] head (2,4), tail (2,5)\n\nTurn 4: move D to (2,3), no food. Head to (2,3), body (2,5) moves to (2,4), so positions [(2,3), (2,4)] head (2,3), tail (2,4)\n\nTurn 5: move D to (2,2), food there, so eat: head to (2,2), body doesn't move, new segment added at tail position, so positions: head (2,2), body (2,3) and (2,4) -- [(2,2), (2,3), (2,4)] length 3.\n\nThen I can go for (1,2), but (1,2) is adjacent, move left to (1,2) to eat.\n\nBut as before, after that, I'm at (1,2) with body at (2,2) and (2,3), and only moves down or up, not right or left to wall.\n\nDown to (1,1), which is corner, then from there, I can go right or up, but (1,1) neighbors: (1,2) body, (2,1), (1,0) wall, so only to (2,1).\n\nThen from (2,1), etc., but it might be tight to get to (3,5) which is far, and (3,5) might disappear if life span low, but life span 10, turn 5, still 5 left, but I need to go from (1,1) to (3,5), which is across the grid.\n\nPath might be long, and with snake length 3, it might block itself.\n\nFor example, from (1,1), move to (2,1), then to (3,1), then to (3,2), etc., but (3,2) has no food, and I need to go to (3,5), but food at (3,5) might be eaten or not.\n\nBut in this scenario, I ate (2,2) at turn 5, then if I eat (1,2) at turn 6, I'm at (1,2) at turn 6, then to (1,1) or (1,3), say (1,3), then to (1,4), etc., it takes many turns to reach y=5.\n\nFrom (1,2) at turn 6, move U to (1,3) turn 6, then U to (1,4) turn 7, U to (1,5) turn 8, then L? (1,5) to (2,5) or something, but (2,5) might be occupied or not.\n\nBut by turn 8, (3,5) life span: started at turn 0 with life 10, each turn decrease, so at turn 10 it disappears, so on turn 8, life span 2 left, so if I reach on turn 9 or 10, I can eat.\n\nBut from (1,5) at turn 8, I can go to (2,5) turn 9, then to (3,5) turn 10 to eat if still there.\n\nTurn 10: if I move to (3,5) on turn 10, and life span was 10 at turn 0, so at turn 10, it decreases to 0 and disappears, but when does it disappear? \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nSo at turn t, food has life_span, at turn t+1, life_span decreases.\n\nFood at turn 0: life_span 10.\n\nAfter turn 0, at start of turn 1, life_span 9.\n\nGenerally, at the beginning of turn t, food has remaining life.\n\nBut when eaten, it's during the move.\n\nRule: \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) | Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\n\"including current\" might be ambiguous.\n\nAssume: when food is spawned, it has life_span L. At each turn, including the turn it is spawned, the countdown decreases by 1. So after L turns, it disappears, meaning at the start of turn L+1, it's gone.\n\nFor example, food at turn 0 with life_span 10: present on turn 0 to turn 10, disappears at turn 11.\n\nCountdown: at turn 0, countdown 10, after turn 0, countdown 9, ..., after turn 9, countdown 0, so on turn 10, countdown 0, still present? Or disappears after N turns.\n\n\"Disappears after N turns\" – let's read.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) | Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\n\"after N turns\" from when? Probably from spawn turn.\n\nAssume food spawned at turn T with life_span L: it is present from turn T to turn T + L - 1, and disappears at turn T + L.\n\nBecause \"after N turns\" means after N turns have passed, so at turn T + N, it disappears.\n\nCountdown decreases every turn including current: at turn T, countdown L, after turn T, countdown L-1, ..., at turn T + L - 1, countdown 1, after that turn, countdown 0, disappears for turn T + L.\n\nSo for food at turn 0, life_span 10: present on turns 0 to 9, disappears at turn 10.\n\nSimilarly, if eaten on turn t, it is consumed.\n\nIn this case, food with life_span 10 at turn 0: can be eaten from turn 0 to 9.\n\nIn the earlier path, for (3,5), if I eat on turn 1, fine.\n\nIf I go for (2,2) first, I eat on turn 1 or 2.\n\nTurn 0: move L to (2,3)\n\nTurn 1: move D to (2,2) eat, so eaten on turn 1.\n\nThen at turn 1, positions: [(2,2), (2,3)] head (2,2), tail (2,3)\n\nThen I can move to (1,2) to eat on turn 2.\n\nMove L to (1,2) eat, positions: head (1,2), body (2,2) and (2,3) -- [(1,2), (2,2), (2,3)]\n\nThen at (1,2), moves: only D to (1,1) or U to (1,3), since L wall, R body.\n\nSay move U to (1,3) turn 2.\n\nThen at (1,3), moves: U to (1,4), D to (1,2) body, L wall, R to (2,3) body, so only U to (1,4)\n\nTurn 3: move U to (1,4)\n\nThen at (1,4), moves: U to (1,5), D to (1,3) body? Positions: head at (1,4), body (1,3) and (2,2)? Let's track positions.\n\nAfter turn 2: after eating (1,2), positions: [(1,2), (2,2), (2,3)] head (1,2), body (2,2) and tail (2,3)\n\nTurn 3: move U to (1,3), no food, so head to (1,3), body segments move: (2,2) moves to previous head (1,2), (2,3) moves to previous body position (2,2)? List: positions before move: [ (1,2), (2,2), (2,3) ]\n\nAfter moving head to (1,3): new head (1,3), then the first body segment (2,2) moves to old head position (1,2), the second body segment (2,3) moves to old first body position (2,2), so new positions: [ (1,3), (1,2), (2,2) ] head (1,3), body (1,2) and tail (2,2)\n\nThen turn 4: move U to (1,4), no food, head to (1,4), body: (1,2) moves to (1,3), (2,2) moves to (1,2), so positions [ (1,4), (1,3), (1,2) ]\n\nTurn 5: move U to (1,5), no food, positions [ (1,5), (1,4), (1,3) ]\n\nTurn 6: move to (1,6), but y=6, playable, no food, positions [ (1,6), (1,5), (1,4) ]\n\nThen at (1,6), moves: U to (1,7) but y=7 wall, invalid; D to (1,5) body; L wall; R to (2,6)\n\nSo only R to (2,6)\n\nTurn 7: move R to (2,6), positions [ (2,6), (1,6), (1,5) ]\n\nThen from (2,6), can move to (2,5), (3,6), etc., but (3,5) is at (3,5), I can go down.\n\nBut to reach (3,5), from (2,6) turn 7, move D to (2,5) turn 8, then to (3,5) turn 9.\n\n(2,5) to (3,5) is right, but (3,5) is food, so on turn 9, if I move to (3,5), I can eat.\n\nLife span: at turn 0, life span 10, present until turn 9, disappears at turn 10. So on turn 9, I can eat it.\n\nTurn 9: move to (3,5) eat, positions grow to length 4.\n\nBut it's possible, but tight.\n\nIf I go for (3,5) first, I can eat it early and have more room.\n\nAlso, after eating (3,5), I'm at (3,5) with tail at (3,4), and I can move to (2,5) or (4,5) or (3,6), and then go down to get (2,2) and (1,2).\n\nFor example, after eating (3,5) at turn 1, positions [(3,5),(3,4)]\n\nTurn 2: move L to (2,5), no food, positions [(2,5),(3,5)] head (2,5), tail (3,5)\n\nTurn 3: move D to (2,4), positions [(2,4),(2,5)] \n\nTurn 4: move D to (2,3), positions [(2,3),(2,4)]\n\nTurn 5: move D to (2,2) eat, positions [(2,2),(2,3),(2,4)] length 3\n\nThen I can move L to (1,2) to eat on turn 6.\n\nThen at (1,2), with body (2,2) and (2,3), then move U to (1,3) and so on, but I have eaten all food by turn 6.\n\nThen I need to survive, but no more food, so I can just move around.\n\nBut the game might continue with new food spawning? The problem doesn't say; it only mentions the given food, I think. The state has food positions, so probably only these food, and I need to eat as many as possible.\n\nThe goal is to maximize score by eating positive food, so with three food, max score 3.\n\nIn both paths, I can eat all three, but in the first path going for (3,5) first, I eat (3,5) on turn 1, (2,2) on turn 5, (1,2) on turn 6.\n\nIn the second path going for (2,2) first, I eat (2,2) on turn 1, (1,2) on turn 2, then (3,5) on turn 9, just before it disappears.\n\nBut in the second path, I have a long snake in the corner for many turns, which might be risky if there were negative food or something, but here all food positive.\n\nAlso, with internal obstacle, but not affecting.\n\nAnother thing: when I go to (3,6) or something.\n\nBut in the (3,5) first approach, after eating, I can choose to go to (4,5) instead of (2,5) to explore more.\n\nBut (4,5) is near (4,6) wall.\n\nFor example, from (3,5) after eating, move R to (4,5) turn 2.\n\nThen at (4,5), moves: U to (4,6) but (4,6) is wall, invalid; D to (4,4), L to (3,5) body, R to (5,5)\n\nSo only D or R.\n\nSay move D to (4,4) turn 2.\n\nThen from (4,4), I can go to (4,3), etc., but food is at (1,2) and (2,2), so I need to go west.\n\nBut from (4,4), to (3,4) or something, but (3,4) might be body or not.\n\nIn turn 2, positions after move to (4,5): head (4,5), tail (3,5)  [(4,5),(3,5)]\n\nMove D to (4,4) turn 2, no food, positions [(4,4),(4,5)]\n\nThen I need to go to (3,4) or (2,4), but (3,4) was earlier position, not occupied now.\n\nMove L to (3,4) turn 3, positions [(3,4),(4,4)]\n\nThen D to (3,3) but (3,3) might be free, turn 4, positions [(3,3),(3,4)]\n\nThen to (3,2) or (2,3), etc. to reach (2,2).\n\nBut it takes more turns, and (1,2) and (2,2) might have low life span, but still, I can reach.\n\nBut going left directly from (2,5) is shorter.\n\nBack to decision.\n\nFor turn 0, moving L to (2,3) allows me to eat (2,2) quickly, but then I might get stuck in corner with long snake.\n\nMoving U to (3,4) allows me to eat (3,5) quickly and stay in center.\n\nMoreover, (3,5) is at y=5, near the top, but with internal obstacle at (4,6), which might not affect immediately.\n\nThere is another food at (1,2) and (2,2), but (2,2) is also close.\n\nBoth are similar, but let's see the grid.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the area.\n\nThe bottom-left has fewer cells: x=1-2, y=1-2, only 4 cells, but with walls.\n\nCells near (1,2): (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), etc.\n\nBut (1,1) is corner, only two exits.\n\nWhereas (3,5) is more open: can go to (3,6), (2,5), (4,5), (3,4), etc.\n\nAlso, after eating (3,5), I can go to (3,6) which is top row, but still, I can move left or right from there.\n\nFor example, from (3,5) move U to (3,6) turn 2.\n\nThen at (3,6), moves: U to (3,7) wall invalid; D to (3,5) body; L to (2,6), R to (4,6) wall, so only L to (2,6)\n\nTurn 3: move L to (2,6), positions [(2,6),(3,6)] (assuming no food)\n\nThen from (2,6), can move to (2,5), etc.\n\nBut to get to (2,2), I need to go down.\n\nSimilar to before.\n\nBut in all cases, I can reach the food.\n\nBut to maximize survival, staying central might be better.\n\nSince I need to output actions for multiple turns, but the instruction is to output actions for the next turns, but it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" and \"Answer Format: Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\"\n\nBut how many turns to output? It doesn't specify, but since the food has life span, and I need to eat, probably until I eat or something.\n\nBut for now, I need to decide the first move.\n\nPerhaps I should plan a sequence to eat all food efficiently.\n\nFirst, eat (3,5) since it's directly accessible and not near border.\n\nThen from there, go to (2,2) and (1,2).\n\nFrom (3,5), after eating, move L to (2,5) turn 2.\n\nThen D to (2,4) turn 3.\n\nD to (2,3) turn 4.\n\nD to (2,2) eat turn 5.\n\nThen from (2,2), I can move L to (1,2) eat turn 6.\n\nThen all eaten by turn 6.\n\nIf I go for (2,2) first: turn 0 move L to (2,3), turn 1 move D to (2,2) eat, then turn 2 move L to (1,2) eat, then I need to go to (3,5), which is at (3,5).\n\nFrom (1,2) after eating, positions [(1,2),(2,2),(2,3)] at turn 2.\n\nThen move U to (1,3) turn 2? Turn 2: after eating (1,2), positions [(1,2),(2,2),(2,3)] head (1,2)\n\nMove U to (1,3) turn 3, positions [(1,3),(1,2),(2,2)] as before.\n\nThen U to (1,4) turn 4, U to (1,5) turn 5, U to (1,6) turn 6, then R to (2,6) turn 7, then D to (2,5) turn 8, then R to (3,5) turn 9 to eat.\n\nSo I eat (3,5) on turn 9, later than in the first approach.\n\nAnd I use more turns, but same score.\n\nBut in the first approach, I eat all by turn 6, so less risk, and I can survive longer if needed, but no more food.\n\nSo for efficiency, going to (3,5) first is better.\n\nMoreover, with the snake growing in the corner, it might be easier to trap oneself, but in this grid, it's possible to get out.\n\nBut to be safe, central first.\n\nAnother point: the food at (2,2) and (1,2) are close, so I can get both quickly if I go there, but then the last food is far.\n\nWhereas (3,5) is alone, so better to get it first.\n\nAlso, life span same for all.\n\nSo I think moving up to (3,4) first is better.\n\nThen next move to (3,5) to eat.\n\nThen from there, go left and down.\n\nBut for the answer, I need to output multiple turns.\n\nThe format is to output actions for turn t1, t1+1, etc.\n\nBut how many? Until I eat or for a few turns.\n\nSince I need to think ahead, but output the sequence.\n\nPerhaps for 5 turns or so.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nFirst action: move U to (3,4)\n\nThen turn 1: move U to (3,5) eat\n\nThen turn 2: move L to (2,5)  // to go towards (2,2)\n\nThen turn 3: move D to (2,4)\n\nThen turn 4: move D to (2,3)\n\nThen turn 5: move D to (2,2) eat\n\nThen turn 6: move L to (1,2) eat\n\nBut I need to output from turn 0.\n\nAlso, at turn 5, when I move to (2,2), I eat, so on turn 6, I can move to (1,2).\n\nBut for the sequence, I can output up to turn 5 or so.\n\nSince the snake is short at first, no risk.\n\nAnother thing: the internal obstacle at (4,6) doesn't affect this path.\n\nSo I think this is fine.\n\nIf I move D or L first, it might lead to corner faster.\n\nSo for turn 0, move U.\n\nThen for subsequent turns, as above.\n\nBut in the sequence, after turn 1, I eat, so the food is gone.\n\nBut I need to specify actions.\n\nAlso, the head direction changes.\n\nAfter move U, direction becomes U.\n\nThen after move U again, still U.\n\nThen move L, direction L, etc.\n\nNo instant reverse issue since I'm not reversing immediately.\n\nFor example, from (3,5) facing U, moving L to (2,5) is left, not reverse.\n\nSimilarly, from (2,5) facing L, moving D is down, not reverse.\n\nEtc.\n\nSo all good.\n\nI think this is a solid plan.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score and ensure long-term survival, I will prioritize eating the positive food while avoiding dead ends and risky positions. The current state (turn \\(t_1 = 0\\)) has the snake at position (3,3) with a head direction of left (L), and three positive food items at (1,2), (2,2), and (3,5), each with a value of +1 and a life span of 10 turns. The grid has walls at the borders (x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7) and an internal obstacle at (4,6). The snake is currently length 1, so body collisions are not a concern yet, but after eating, growth must be managed to avoid future collisions.\n\n### Key Considerations for the Plan:\n- **Immediate Moves (Turn 0)**: The snake can move up (U), down (D), or left (L), but not right (R) due to the no-instant-reverse rule (current direction is L).\n- **Food Prioritization**: \n  - (3,5) is directly accessible in 2 turns and is centrally located, allowing better maneuverability for future moves. Eating it first avoids the risk of getting trapped in the bottom-left corner near (1,2) and (2,2).\n  - (2,2) and (1,2) are close to each other but near the border; they can be eaten sequentially after (3,5) with minimal risk.\n- **Life Span Management**: All food has a life span of 10, disappearing after turn 10 (i.e., not available on turn 10). Eating (3,5) by turn 1, (2,2) by turn 5, and (1,2) by turn 6 ensures all are consumed with ample time (life spans: 10, 9, and 4 turns remaining respectively at consumption).\n- **5+ Turn Lookahead**: \n  - After eating (3,5), the snake grows to length 2. Moving left to (2,5) and then down toward (2,2) avoids walls and the internal obstacle, keeping the path open.\n  - After eating (2,2), moving left to (1,2) is safe as the tail will move away, preventing collision.\n  - By turn 6, all food is eaten (score = 3), and the snake can navigate openly for survival (e.g., moving up from (1,2) to explore).\n- **Risk Avoidance**: \n  - Starting with (3,5) keeps the snake central, reducing border risks. \n  - The path avoids the internal obstacle at (4,6) entirely.\n  - Tail reward danger is irrelevant here, as no food is on the tail cells during the plan.\n\n### Action Plan (Turns 0 to 6):\n- **Turn 0**: Move U (up) to (3,4) – Positions snake to reach (3,5) next turn. Avoids left/down which lead toward the constricting corner. Direction becomes U.\n- **Turn 1**: Move U (up) to (3,5) – Eats food at (3,5). Snake grows to length 2 (positions: head (3,5), tail (3,4)). Score +1. Direction remains U.\n- **Turn 2**: Move L (left) to (2,5) – Moves toward (2,2) without risk (no food or walls). Positions: head (2,5), tail (3,5). Direction becomes L.\n- **Turn 3**: Move D (down) to (2,4) – Continues path to (2,2). Safe, as (2,4) is open. Positions: head (2,4), tail (2,5). Direction becomes D.\n- **Turn 4**: Move D (down) to (2,3) – Approaches (2,2). Positions: head (2,3), tail (2,4). Direction remains D.\n- **Turn 5**: Move D (down) to (2,2) – Eats food at (2,2). Snake grows to length 3 (positions: head (2,2), body (2,3), tail (2,4)). Score +1 (total 2). Direction remains D.\n- **Turn 6**: Move L (left) to (1,2) – Eats food at (1,2). Snake grows to length 4 (positions: head (1,2), body (2,2), (2,3), tail (2,4)). Score +1 (total 3). Direction becomes L.\n\n### Why This Plan?\n- **Efficiency**: All food eaten by turn 6 with no wasted moves. (3,5) is eaten on turn 1, (2,2) on turn 5, and (1,2) on turn 6, all within life spans.\n- **Survival Focus**: The snake stays in open areas early, avoiding corners until necessary. After turn 6, the snake can move up (e.g., to (1,3)) to explore safely.\n- **Risk Mitigation**: No wall or body collisions occur. The internal obstacle is irrelevant to this path. Direction changes respect no-instant-reverse.\n\nThis sequence maximizes score (3) and ensures long-term survival by completing all food consumption early and maintaining flexibility.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 0: U \\\\\nTurn 1: U \\\\\nTurn 2: L \\\\\nTurn 3: D \\\\\nTurn 4: D \\\\\nTurn 5: D \\\\\nTurn 6: L\n}",
