        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 through y=8. The player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing the y-position by +1, -1, or 0 each turn, staying within 0 to 9.\n\nCars move left or right on their freeways. For right-moving cars, the span increases with time: [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] for turn T. Similarly for left-moving, but all cars here seem to be right-moving based on the direction given.\n\nIn the car state, all are \"right\" direction, so they're moving right, meaning their positions increase over time.\n\nCollision occurs only if at turn T, the player is on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there's a car where 0 is in its span at that turn. The note says that when you move to a new y, you're not on that new y until the next turn, so you only check collision for the freeway you're currently on at the start of the turn.\n\nLet me denote the current turn as t1 = 0 for simplicity, since t0=0 is given.\n\nSo at turn T, player position y_T, and we check if for freeway k = y_T, 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nThe span is defined for each car, and we need to see if 0 is in the span for any car on row y_T at time T.\n\nNow, the cars are given at time t1=0 with their head, tail, direction, speed.\n\nSince all are right-moving, direction right.\n\nFor a right-moving car, at time t, span is [τ + s(t - t1), h + s(t - t1)] where (h, τ) are at t1.\n\nIn the table, for freeway 1, cars: (-48,-59,right,4), (-12,-23,right,4), (24,13,right,4)\n\nBut for a right-moving car, head should be greater than tail? If it's moving right, head is the front, so for a car moving right, head > tail, I assume.\n\nIn the first car, h=-48, τ=-59, since -48 > -59, yes, head is larger.\n\nSimilarly, second car: h=-12, τ=-23, -12 > -23.\n\nThird: h=24, τ=13, 24>13.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, the span at time t is [τ + s(t - t1), h + s(t - t1)] for right-moving.\n\nAnd collision if 0 is in that interval for some car on the row y_t at time t.\n\nSince the player moves vertically, and cars are on horizontal freeways, we only care about the x=0 position at each turn.\n\nThe player is always at x=0, I think? The position is (0, y_t), so x=0 fixed, y changes.\n\nYes.\n\nSo for each freeway row, we need to know when a car covers x=0.\n\nThat is, when τ + s(t - t1) <= 0 <= h + s(t - t1) for some car on that row.\n\nSince h > τ for right-moving cars, the span is from left to right: from τ + sΔt to h + sΔt.\n\nSo 0 is covered when min(τ + sΔt, h + sΔt) <= 0 <= max(τ + sΔt, h + sΔt), but since s>0 and h>τ, it's always τ + sΔt <= h + sΔt, so the condition is τ + sΔt <= 0 <= h + sΔt.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but here all right.\n\nSo for a car, at time t, it covers x=0 if τ + s(t) <= 0 <= h + s(t), where t is time since t1=0, so Δt = t.\n\nSet t1=0, so time t=0,1,2,...\n\nAt time t, for a car with initial τ, h, s, it covers x=0 if:\n\nτ + s*t <= 0 <= h + s*t\n\nBecause Δt = t.\n\nt is absolute turn number, but since t1=0, t=0,1,2,... is fine.\n\nNow, the player at turn t is at y_t, and we need no collision, so for row k, if y_t = k, then for all cars on row k, none should satisfy τ + s*t <= 0 <= h + s*t.\n\nThat is, for that row, at time t, x=0 should not be covered by any car.\n\nNow, the player starts at y=0 at t=0.\n\ny=0 is not a freeway, it's the start, I think. Freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nThe problem says: avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1, ..., 8. And reach (0,9), so y=0 and y=9 have no cars, so safe.\n\nAt t=0, player at (0,0), y=0, no car, so safe.\n\nWe need to reach (0,9), which is also safe.\n\nNow, to minimize H, the number of turns, so we want to go up as fast as possible, but avoid the rows when cars are at x=0.\n\nSince we can only move one step per turn, minimum H is 9, if we go up every turn: U,U,U,U,U,U,U,U,U to from y=0 to y=9 in 9 turns.\n\nBut we need to avoid collisions on y=1 to 8 during those turns.\n\nSo we need to check for each row and time when it is unsafe.\n\nFirst, let's list all the cars per freeway row.\n\nFreeway 1: cars with (h, τ, d, s) = (-48,-59,right,4), (-12,-23,right,4), (24,13,right,4)\n\nSince all same speed, and direction, we can find the times when x=0 is covered.\n\nFor a car, the time when it covers x=0: solve τ + s t <= 0 <= h + s t\n\nSo for each inequality:\n\n0 <= h + s t ⇒ t >= -h/s\n\nand τ + s t <= 0 ⇒ t <= -τ/s\n\nSince s>0.\n\nAlso, since h and τ could be negative or positive.\n\nThe condition τ + s t <= 0 <= h + s t implies that t must satisfy max( ceil( (-h)/s ) , something ) let's think carefully.\n\nτ + s t <= 0 <= h + s t\n\nSince h > τ, the interval for t is from t_low to t_high where:\n\nt <= -τ/s\n\nt >= -h/s\n\nAnd since h > τ, -h/s < -τ/s, so t must be in [ ceil(-h/s) , floor(-τ/s) ]? But t integer, so we need to find integer t where the inequalities hold.\n\nLet's compute for each car the range of t where it covers x=0.\n\nFirst car on row1: h=-48, τ=-59, s=4\n\nτ + s t <= 0 <= h + s t\n\n-59 + 4t <= 0 <= -48 + 4t\n\nSo -59 + 4t <= 0 ⇒ 4t <= 59 ⇒ t <= 59/4 = 14.75, so t <= 14 since t integer\n\n0 <= -48 + 4t ⇒ 48 <= 4t ⇒ t >= 12\n\nSo t from 12 to 14 inclusive.\n\nSimilarly, second car on row1: h=-12, τ=-23, s=4\n\n-23 + 4t <= 0 <= -12 + 4t\n\n-23 + 4t <= 0 ⇒ 4t <= 23 ⇒ t <= 5.75, t <= 5\n\n0 <= -12 + 4t ⇒ 12 <= 4t ⇒ t >= 3\n\nSo t=3,4,5\n\nThird car on row1: h=24, τ=13, s=4\n\n13 + 4t <= 0 <= 24 + 4t\n\n13 + 4t <= 0 ⇒ 4t <= -13 ⇒ t <= -13/4 = -3.25, so t <= -4? But t>=0, so this inequality never true for t>=0.\n\n0 <= 24 + 4t, which is always true for t>=0.\n\nBut since left inequality 13+4t <=0 not possible for t>=0, so this car never covers x=0 for t>=0.\n\nSimilarly, for other rows.\n\nNow row2: same as row1? Freeway 2 has same cars: (-48,-59,right,4), (-12,-23,right,4), (24,13,right,4)\n\nSo identical to row1, so unsafe at same times: from car1 t=12,13,14; car2 t=3,4,5; car3 never.\n\nSo for row2, unsafe at t=3,4,5 and t=12,13,14.\n\nNow row3: cars (48,37,right,6), (12,1,right,6), (-24,-35,right,6)\n\nFirst car: h=48, τ=37, s=6\n\nτ + s t <=0 <= h + s t\n\n37 + 6t <=0 <=48 + 6t\n\n37+6t <=0 ⇒ 6t <= -37 ⇒ t <= -37/6 ≈ -6.166, impossible for t>=0\n\n0 <=48+6t always true, but left not, so never covers x=0.\n\nSecond car: h=12, τ=1, s=6\n\n1 + 6t <=0 <=12 + 6t\n\n1+6t <=0 ⇒ 6t <= -1, impossible\n\n0<=12+6t always, so never covers x=0.\n\nThird car: h=-24, τ=-35, s=6\n\n-35 + 6t <=0 <= -24 + 6t\n\n-35+6t <=0 ⇒ 6t <=35 ⇒ t <= 35/6 ≈5.833, t<=5\n\n0 <= -24 + 6t ⇒ 24 <=6t ⇒ t>=4\n\nSo t=4,5\n\nThus for row3, unsafe at t=4,5\n\nNow row4: same as row3? Cars (48,37,right,6), (12,1,right,6), (-24,-35,right,6)\n\nSo same as row3, unsafe at t=4,5\n\nNow row5: cars (48,37,right,12), (12,1,right,12), (-24,-35,right,12)\n\ns=12\n\nFirst car: h=48, τ=37, s=12\n\n37+12t <=0 <=48+12t\n\n37+12t <=0 ⇒ 12t <= -37, impossible\n\n0<=48+12t always, never.\n\nSecond car: h=12, τ=1, s=12\n\n1+12t <=0 <=12+12t\n\n1+12t <=0 ⇒ 12t <= -1, impossible, never.\n\nThird car: h=-24, τ=-35, s=12\n\n-35 +12t <=0 <= -24 +12t\n\n-35+12t <=0 ⇒ 12t <=35 ⇒ t <= 35/12 ≈2.916, t<=2\n\n0 <= -24 +12t ⇒ 24 <=12t ⇒ t>=2\n\nSo t=2\n\nThus for row5, unsafe only at t=2\n\nNow row6: only one car (48,37,right,3)\n\nh=48, τ=37, s=3\n\n37 +3t <=0 <=48+3t\n\n37+3t <=0 ⇒ 3t <= -37, impossible\n\n0<=48+3t always, never covers x=0.\n\nSo row6 always safe.\n\nNow row7: car (-48,-71,right,24)\n\nh=-48, τ=-71, s=24\n\n-71 +24t <=0 <= -48 +24t\n\n-71+24t <=0 ⇒ 24t <=71 ⇒ t <= 71/24 ≈2.958, t<=2\n\n0 <= -48 +24t ⇒ 48 <=24t ⇒ t>=2\n\nSo t=2\n\nThus row7 unsafe at t=2\n\nRow8: same car? (-48,-71,right,24), so same as row7, unsafe at t=2\n\nNow, summarize for each row and time when unsafe:\n\ny=1: unsafe t=3,4,5 and t=12,13,14\n\ny=2: same as y=1, t=3,4,5,12,13,14\n\ny=3: unsafe t=4,5\n\ny=4: unsafe t=4,5\n\ny=5: unsafe t=2\n\ny=6: always safe\n\ny=7: unsafe t=2\n\ny=8: unsafe t=2\n\ny=6 always safe.\n\nPlayer starts at y=0 at t=0.\n\nWe need to reach y=9, and we can move U, D, S.\n\nTo minimize turns, we want to go up as much as possible, but avoid being on unsafe row at unsafe time.\n\nSince y=6 is always safe, we might use that.\n\nBut let's list the unsafe times per row:\n\nRow: unsafe times\n\n1: {3,4,5,12,13,14}\n\n2: {3,4,5,12,13,14}\n\n3: {4,5}\n\n4: {4,5}\n\n5: {2}\n\n6: none\n\n7: {2}\n\n8: {2}\n\nNow, player at t=0, y=0, safe.\n\nWe need to be at y=9 at some turn H, with actions from t=0 to t=H-1, I think.\n\nThe sequence is for t from 0 to H-1, and at turn H, position is (0,9).\n\nThe actions {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, so at time t, action a_t, then position at t+1 is y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy.\n\nLet me define the time.\n\nAt the beginning of turn t, position is y_t.\n\nAfter action a_t, position becomes y_{t+1} for the next turn.\n\nCollision check at turn t: when we are at position y_t, we check for freeway y_t (if between 1 and 8) if 0 covered.\n\nThen we perform action a_t, move to y_{t+1}, and so on.\n\nWe start at t=0, y=0.\n\nAfter H actions, at time H, we have y_H = 9.\n\nAnd we need y_H = 9, which is safe.\n\nNow, to minimize H, so we want y_t to increase to 9 quickly.\n\nBut with constraints that for each t, if y_t in 1-8, it must be safe at that time.\n\ny_t is the row we are on during turn t.\n\nFor example, at t=0, y_0=0, not a freeway, safe.\n\nWe perform a_0, go to y_1.\n\nThen at t=1, we are at y_1, which could be 0 or 1, if y_1=1, then we check row1 at time t=1.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nThe collision is checked at the start of each turn, based on current y_t.\n\nNow, to reach y=9, minimum steps: if no obstacles, from y=0 to y=9, need 9 steps: U each time, so at t=9, y_9=9.\n\nBut we need to avoid being on unsafe rows at unsafe times.\n\nSo let's see for each time, what rows are safe.\n\nTime t: safe rows\n\nt=0: all rows except freeways? At t=0, player at y=0, which is not a freeway, so safe. But if player were on freeway, we check.\n\nFor the grid, rows 1-8 are freeways, row 0 and 9 are not.\n\nSo at any time, if y_t = k for k=1-8, then unsafe if t in unsafe times for k.\n\nIf y_t=0 or 9, always safe.\n\nNow, for each t, the possible y positions that are safe.\n\nBut we care about the path.\n\nSince we start at t=0, y=0.\n\nWe need to be at y=9 at some T.\n\nTo minimize T, the arrival time.\n\nSince each action changes y by at most 1, T >=9.\n\nCan we achieve T=9? That is, reach y=9 at t=9.\n\nThat means we must go up every turn from t=0 to t=8, so y_t = t for t=0 to 9.\n\ny_t = t.\n\nNow, check for each t from 1 to 8, since y_t = t for t=1 to 8, we need row t to be safe at time t.\n\nSo for t=1: y=1 at time t=1\n\nRow1 unsafe at t=3,4,5,12,13,14. t=1 not in, so safe? Unsafe times are 3,4,5,etc, t=1 not unsafe, so safe.\n\nSimilarly t=2: y=2 at time t=2\n\nRow2 unsafe at t=3,4,5,12,13,14, t=2 not in, safe.\n\nt=3: y=3 at time t=3\n\nRow3 unsafe at t=4,5, t=3 not in, so safe? Row3 unsafe only at t=4,5? Earlier we have for row3, unsafe at t=4,5.\n\nAt t=3, y=3, row3 safe? Yes, since unsafe only at 4,5.\n\nSimilarly, t=4: y=4 at time t=4\n\nBut row4 unsafe at t=4,5, so at t=4, row4 unsafe.\n\ny=4 at t=4, row4 unsafe at t=4, so collision if we are there.\n\nIn the path y_t=t, at t=4, y=4, which is row4, and t=4 is unsafe time for row4, so collision.\n\nThus cannot be on row4 at t=4.\n\nSimilarly, t=5: y=5 at t=5, row5 unsafe at t=2, not t=5, so safe? Row5 unsafe only at t=2.\n\nt=5: y=5, row5 unsafe times {2}, t=5 not 2, so safe.\n\nBut at t=4, problem.\n\nt=4: y=4, row4 unsafe at t=4 and t=5.\n\nSo at t=4, unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, t=5: y=5, row5 safe since t=5 not unsafe time.\n\nt=6: y=6, row6 always safe.\n\nt=7: y=7, row7 unsafe at t=2, not t=7, safe.\n\nt=8: y=8, row8 unsafe at t=2, not t=8, safe.\n\nt=9: y=9, safe.\n\nSo only issue at t=4 with y=4.\n\nBut we must avoid being on row4 at t=4.\n\nIn the direct path, we are on row4 at t=4 and it's unsafe.\n\nSo we need to adjust.\n\nPerhaps delay or something.\n\nSince T=9 might not be possible, we need more turns.\n\nBut let's see if we can still reach at t=9 by not going straight up.\n\nFor example, at some point, we stay or move down to avoid the unsafe time.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9, so moving down might not help.\n\nWe can stay at a safe row until the unsafe time passes.\n\nBut we need to minimize H, so delay might increase H.\n\nFirst, let's list the unsafe times for each row again:\n\nRow 1: unsafe t=3,4,5,12,13,14\n\nRow 2: same t=3,4,5,12,13,14\n\nRow 3: unsafe t=4,5\n\nRow 4: unsafe t=4,5\n\nRow 5: unsafe t=2\n\nRow 6: always safe\n\nRow 7: unsafe t=2\n\nRow 8: unsafe t=2\n\nNow, the critical times are around t=2,4,5.\n\nSpecifically, at t=2, rows 5,7,8 are unsafe.\n\nAt t=4 and t=5, rows 1,2,3,4 are unsafe.\n\nRows 3 and 4 unsafe at t=4,5; rows 1 and 2 also unsafe at t=4,5? Rows 1 and 2 unsafe at t=3,4,5, etc.\n\nBut for t=4 and t=5, multiple rows unsafe.\n\nNow, back to reaching y=9 at t=9.\n\nIf we go directly up, we have problem at t=4.\n\nSo perhaps we can be at a different row at t=4.\n\nFor example, at t=4, if we are not on row4.\n\nBut in the sequence, if we go up slower.\n\nStart t=0, y=0.\n\nAfter a_0, y_1 = something.\n\nWe need to define the actions.\n\nLet me denote the position at time t.\n\nt=0: y=0, safe.\n\nWe apply action a_0, go to y_1.\n\nThen at t=1, we are at y_1, must be safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nTo reach y=9 at t=9, we need y_9=9.\n\nSince each step changes by at most 1, y_t must be between 0 and 9.\n\nThe net displacement must be +9 in 9 steps, so we must have exactly 9 Up moves, no Down or Stay, because if we have S or D, we need more steps to compensate, so H>9.\n\nFor example, if we do one Stay, then to go from 0 to 9, we need at least 10 actions: 9U and 1S, so y_10=9.\n\nSimilarly, if Down, even worse.\n\nSo to achieve H=9, we must have all actions U, no S or D.\n\nThen y_t = t for t=0 to 9.\n\nBut as above, at t=4, y=4, row4 unsafe at t=4.\n\nAnd we cannot avoid it with all U.\n\nTherefore, it's impossible to reach at t=9.\n\nThus minimum H is at least 10.\n\nNow, with H=10, we can have 9U and 1S or 8U and 2S, etc., but since we need to avoid collision, we might insert a Stay or Down at some point.\n\nBut Down might not help, as we need to go up eventually.\n\nProbably Stay is better to delay.\n\nNow, we need to reach y=9 at t=10, for example.\n\ny_10=9.\n\nThen we have 10 actions, from a_0 to a_9.\n\ny_0=0\n\ny_1 = y_0 + a_0, etc.\n\nAfter 10 actions, y_10=9.\n\nNet +9 in 10 steps, so number of U minus number of D must be 9, and let S be number of Stay.\n\nLet U be number of Up, D down, S stay.\n\nU + D + S = 10 (number of actions)\n\ny_10 - y_0 = U - D = 9\n\nAlso, y_t between 0 and 9 for all t.\n\nFrom U - D =9, and U + D + S =10, so (U - D) + (U + D + S) = 9 + 10 =19, so 2U + S =19.\n\nSimilarly, U - D =9.\n\nSince U and D integers, possible (U,D,S): for example, U=9, D=0, S=1; or U=10, D=1, S=0? U=10, D=1, U-D=9, but U+D+S=10+1+0=11>10, no.\n\nNumber of actions is 10, so U + D + S =10.\n\nU - D =9.\n\nThen from U - D =9, U + D + S =10, subtract: (U+D+S) - (U-D) =10-9 => 2D + S =1.\n\nSo 2D + S =1.\n\nSince D and S non-negative integers, possible cases:\n\nD=0, S=1; or D=1, S=-1 impossible; so only D=0, S=1.\n\nThus U=9, D=0, S=1.\n\nSo we must have 9 Up, 1 Stay, and no Down.\n\nExactly one Stay action.\n\nNow, we need to choose when to Stay to avoid the unsafe positions.\n\nThe path: we start at y=0, after actions, end at y=10=9? y at time t.\n\nt=0: y=0\n\nAfter a_0, y1\n\n...\n\nAfter a9, y10=9\n\ny_t for t=0 to 10.\n\nWe need y_t for t=1 to 9 to be safe when on freeway.\n\ny_t=0 or 9 are always safe.\n\nNow, with one Stay, the y_t sequence increases by 1 except one time it stays same.\n\nSo the values: since we start at 0, end at 9, with 10 steps, one Stay, so y_t must go from 0 to 9, with one plateau, meaning for some t, y_t = y_{t+1}.\n\nSince S means y_{t+1} = y_t.\n\nIn the sequence, for one t, y_t = y_{t+1}, and for others, y_{t+1} = y_t +1.\n\nNow, we need to avoid that at unsafe times, we are on unsafe row.\n\nUnsafe times:\n\nAt t=2, rows 5,7,8 unsafe.\n\nAt t=4, rows 1,2,3,4 unsafe (since row1,2 unsafe t=4; row3,4 unsafe t=4)\n\nAt t=5, rows 1,2,3,4 unsafe.\n\nAlso t=3, rows 1,2 unsafe.\n\nBut t=3,4,5 are problematic for rows 1-4.\n\nSpecifically, for the direct path, t=4 was issue.\n\nNow with extra step, we can stay at some point.\n\nWe need to choose where to stay.\n\nSince row6 is always safe, we might stay on row6.\n\nBut let's list the times and safe rows.\n\nFor each t, the rows that are safe:\n\nt=0: y=0 safe, or if on freeway, but at t=0 player at y=0.\n\nBut for the path, at time t, y_t must be such that if y_t in 1-8, it must be safe at t.\n\nSo for t=1: safe rows: all except row1 if t=1 unsafe? Row1 unsafe at t=3,4,5,12,13,14, so at t=1, row1 is safe. Similarly row2 safe at t=1.\n\nRow3 safe at t=1, etc.\n\nOnly specific times unsafe.\n\nSo for t=1: all rows safe, since no row unsafe at t=1 except? t=1 not unsafe for any row.\n\nRow1 unsafe starts t=3, row3 at t=4, row5 at t=2, etc.\n\nSo t=1: all rows 1-8 safe.\n\nt=2: unsafe rows: 5,7,8. So safe rows: 1,2,3,4,6\n\nt=3: unsafe rows: 1,2 (since unsafe at t=3,4,5). Row1 and row2 unsafe at t=3. Row3 unsafe at t=4,5, so at t=3 row3 safe. Similarly row4 safe at t=3. Row5 unsafe only t=2, so safe at t=3. Row6 safe, row7 unsafe t=2, safe at t=3, row8 unsafe t=2, safe at t=3.\n\nSo t=3: unsafe rows 1 and 2; safe rows 3,4,5,6,7,8\n\nt=4: unsafe rows: 1,2,3,4 (row1,2 unsafe; row3,4 unsafe at t=4,5; row5 safe; row6 safe; row7 safe; row8 safe)\n\nSo safe rows at t=4: only 5,6,7,8\n\nt=5: similar, unsafe rows 1,2,3,4; safe rows 5,6,7,8\n\nt=6: row1 unsafe at t=3,4,5,12,13,14, t=6 not, so row1 safe. Similarly all rows safe except? Row1 safe, row2 safe, row3 unsafe t=4,5, t=6 safe, row4 safe, row5 safe, row6 safe, row7 safe, row8 safe. All safe at t=6.\n\nSimilarly t=7 to t=11, all safe except later times, but since we want to reach early, t=6 to t=10 should be fine.\n\nt=12,13,14 some unsafe, but if we reach by t=10, no problem.\n\nNow back to path with H=10, so t from 0 to 10, y_t.\n\ny_0=0\n\ny_10=9\n\nWith one Stay, so y_t increases 9 times and stays once.\n\nThe position y_t must be safe for each t=1 to 9 (since at t=10, y=9 safe, but t=10, if on freeway, but y=9 not freeway, so only t=1 to 9 need to be safe if y_t in 1-8.\n\ny_t=0 or 9 safe, so only when y_t between 1 and 8 inclusive, need to be safe at time t.\n\nNow, to avoid the problem at t=4.\n\nIn direct path, at t=4, y=4, which is unsafe.\n\nWith extra step, we can, for example, stay at y=3 for one turn, or at y=4 later, but we need to see.\n\nSince at t=4, the only safe rows are 5,6,7,8.\n\nSimilarly at t=5, safe rows 5,6,7,8.\n\nAt t=2, safe rows 1,2,3,4,6.\n\nNow, let's try to have a path that at t=4, we are on a safe row, i.e., y_4 >=5.\n\nSimilarly, since we start from low, we need to be higher earlier.\n\ny_0=0\n\nAfter t=0, action a_0, to y_1.\n\nSuppose we go up as much as possible until we need to avoid.\n\nFor example, at t=1, we can be at y=1, safe.\n\nAt t=2, we need to be at safe row for t=2, which are 1,2,3,4,6.\n\nIf we are at y=2 at t=2, row2 is safe at t=2? Row2 unsafe at t=3,4,5, not t=2, so yes safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=1,2,3,4,6 all safe at t=2.\n\nBut at t=2, row5,7,8 unsafe, so y=5,7,8 unsafe at t=2.\n\nNow, at t=3, safe rows 3,4,5,6,7,8; unsafe rows 1,2.\n\nSo at t=3, we cannot be on y=1 or 2.\n\nAt t=4, safe rows 5,6,7,8; unsafe rows 1,2,3,4.\n\nSo at t=4, we must be on y=5,6,7, or 8.\n\nSimilarly at t=5, same, must be on y=5,6,7,8.\n\nNow, we need to reach y=9 by t=10.\n\nStart from t=0, y=0.\n\nt=1: after a_0, y_1. Can be 0 or 1.\n\nIf we go to y=1 at t=1, safe.\n\nt=2: from y_1, action a_1, to y_2.\n\ny_2 must be safe at t=2, so y_2 in {1,2,3,4,6}\n\ny_2 cannot be 5,7,8.\n\nNow, at t=3: from y_2, action a_2, to y_3.\n\ny_3 must be safe at t=3, so y_3 in {3,4,5,6,7,8}, not 1 or 2.\n\nAt t=4: y_4 must be in {5,6,7,8}\n\nAt t=5: y_5 must be in {5,6,7,8}\n\nThen from t=6 to t=9, all rows safe, so we can go up freely.\n\nt=10, y=9.\n\nNow, we need to have y_10=9, with 10 steps from y_0=0.\n\nSince we have one Stay, the y_t sequence has one time where it stays, so the values increase slower.\n\nFor example, suppose we go up to y=3 or something.\n\nList y_t:\n\nt=0: y=0\n\nt=1: y=1 (if U)\n\nt=2: y_2 must be in {1,2,3,4,6}\n\nIf we go to y=2, for example.\n\nThen t=2: y=2, safe.\n\nt=3: from y=2, we can go to y=3 (U), or y=2 (S), or y=1 (D), but y=1 at t=3 is unsafe, so cannot go to y=1.\n\ny=3 at t=3 is safe.\n\ny=2 at t=3: but at t=3, row2 is unsafe, so if y_3=2, unsafe.\n\ny_3 must be in {3,4,5,6,7,8}, not 1 or 2.\n\nSo from y_2, if y_2=2, then to y_3, we can go U to 3, or S to 2, or D to 1.\n\nBut y_3=1 or 2 unsafe, so we must go to y_3=3 (U) or stay at y_3=2 (S), but y_3=2 is unsafe at t=3, so we cannot stay or go down; must go up to y=3.\n\nSimilarly, if y_2=3, we can go to 4, or stay 3, or down to 2, but down to 2 unsafe, so only to 4 or stay 3.\n\ny_3=3 at t=3: row3 safe at t=3, since unsafe only t=4,5.\n\nSo y_3=3 is safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut we need to reach y=4 or higher by t=4.\n\nt=4: y_4 must be >=5, since {5,6,7,8}\n\nSimilarly t=5: y_5 >=5.\n\nNow, at t=3, y_3 must be in {3,4,5,6,7,8}\n\nBut y_4 = y_3 + a_3, so if y_3 <=4, to reach y_4 >=5, we need to go up, so a_3=U, y_4 = y_3 +1.\n\nIf y_3 >=5, we can stay or go up.\n\nBut y_4 must be >=5.\n\nSimilarly for y_5.\n\nNow, since we have to be high at t=4, we need to be at least y=3 at t=3 to reach y=4 or more? y_3 min 3 to have y_4=4 if U, but y_4 must be at least 5, so if y_3=3, y_4=4 if U, but 4 not >=5, contradiction.\n\ny_4 must be 5,6,7,8.\n\nIf y_3=3, then even if we go up, y_4=4, but 4 not in {5,6,7,8}, unsafe.\n\nIf y_3=4, go up to y_4=5, which is ok.\n\nIf y_3=5, go up to 6 or stay at 5, both ok for y_4.\n\nSimilarly, if y_3=6, etc.\n\nSo to have y_4 >=5, we need y_3 >=4, because:\n\n- If y_3=3, y_4 <=4 (since max change +1), so y_4=3 or 4, both <5, not in safe set.\n\n- If y_3=4, then y_4 can be 4 (S), 5 (U), or 3 (D). But y_4 must be >=5, so must go U to y_4=5.\n\n- If y_3=5, y_4 can be 4,5,6; must be >=5, so not 4, so S or U to 5 or 6.\n\nSimilarly for higher.\n\nThus, to have y_4 >=5, we must have y_3 >=4.\n\nSpecifically, y_3 must be at least 4.\n\nBut y_3 must be in {3,4,5,6,7,8}, so y_3 >=3.\n\nBut from above, if y_3=3, cannot reach y_4>=5.\n\nThus y_3 must be at least 4.\n\nSimilarly, for y_5, but y_5 must be >=5, but easier.\n\nNow, back to earlier.\n\nAt t=2, y_2 in {1,2,3,4,6}\n\nThen from y_2, to y_3.\n\ny_3 must be in {3,4,5,6,7,8} and y_3 >=4 as above.\n\nNow, y_3 = y_2 + a_2, where a_2 is U, D, or S.\n\nIf y_2 <=3, to have y_3 >=4, need a_2=U and y_2 >=3? y_3 = y_2 + delta, delta = -1,0,1.\n\nSo if y_2 <=3, y_3 <=4 if U, or less.\n\nBut y_3 must be >=4, so:\n\n- If y_2 <=2, then y_3 <=3 if U, or less, but y_3 must be >=4, impossible.\n\ny_3 <= y_2 +1.\n\nIf y_2 <=2, y_3 <=3 <4, cannot have y_3 >=4.\n\nIf y_2=3, y_3 can be 2,3,4; to have y_3>=4, must be y_3=4, so a_2=U.\n\nIf y_2=4, y_3 can be 3,4,5; must be y_3=4 or 5, so a_2=S or U, not D.\n\nIf y_2=6, y_3 can be 5,6,7; all >=4 and in set, ok.\n\nBut y_2 cannot be 5 or 7,8 because at t=2, y=5,7,8 unsafe.\n\ny_2 in {1,2,3,4,6}\n\nNow:\n\n- If y_2=1, then y_3 <=2, but y_3 must >=4, impossible. Contradiction.\n\n- If y_2=2, y_3 <=3 <4, impossible.\n\n- If y_2=3, then y_3 must be 4 (since >=4 and <=4? y_3=2,3,4 possible, but must be >=4, so y_3=4, thus a_2=U.\n\n- If y_2=4, y_3 must be >=4, so y_3=4 or 5; both possible with S or U.\n\n- If y_2=6, y_3=5,6,7; all >=4, ok.\n\nNow, also y_3 must be in {3,4,5,6,7,8}, which for y_3=4,5,6,7 all fine.\n\ny_3=3 not possible since we need y_3>=4.\n\nFrom above, y_2 cannot be 1 or 2, because cannot reach y_3>=4.\n\nSo y_2 must be 3,4, or 6.\n\nNow, t=1: y_1.\n\ny_1 can be 0 or 1 (since from y_0=0, a_0: S to 0, or U to 1).\n\nIf y_1=0, then to y_2: from y_1=0, a_1: S to 0, U to 1, D invalid? y cannot below 0, so a_1 can be S or U, to y_2=0 or 1.\n\nBut y_2 must be 3,4, or 6.\n\ny_2=0 or 1, not 3,4,6. Impossible.\n\nThus, y_1 cannot be 0; must be y_1=1.\n\nSo a_0 must be U, to y_1=1.\n\nThen at t=1, y=1, row1 safe at t=1, since unsafe starts t=3.\n\nNow from y_1=1, to y_2.\n\ny_2 must be 3,4, or 6.\n\nBut from y_1=1, possible y_2: a_1: U to 2, S to 1, D to 0.\n\nBut y_2 must be 3,4,6.\n\nNone of 2,1,0 is 3,4,6. Impossible.\n\ny_2=2,1,0 possible from y_1=1, but we need y_2=3,4,6.\n\nCannot reach directly.\n\nFor example, to y_2=3: from y_1=1, even with U, y_2=2, not 3.\n\nCannot jump.\n\nSo impossible to have y_2=3,4, or 6 from y_1=1.\n\ny_1=1, y_2 can be at most 2.\n\nBut we need y_2=3,4, or 6, all >=3, but max y_2=2, contradiction.\n\nThus, with H=10, it seems impossible because we cannot reach a high enough y_2 to then have y_3>=4.\n\nSpecifically, from start, at t=1, y=1.\n\nAt t=2, y<=2.\n\nBut we need y_2 to be 3,4, or 6 to have a chance for y_3>=4.\n\nBut y_2<=2, so cannot.\n\nIf we stay at t=1, y_1=0, then y_2<=1, even worse.\n\nSo indeed, with H=10, we cannot satisfy the condition for t=4.\n\nTherefore, H=10 is impossible.\n\nMinimum H must be 11.\n\nNow with H=11, we reach y_11=9.\n\nNumber of actions: 11 actions.\n\ny_11 - y_0 =9, so U - D =9.\n\nU + D + S =11.\n\nThen U - D =9, U + D + S=11, subtract: (U+D+S) - (U-D) =11-9 => 2D + S =2.\n\nSo 2D + S =2.\n\nPossible cases:\n\nD=0, S=2; or D=1, S=0; or D=0, S=2; or D=1, S=0.\n\nCases:\n\n- D=0, S=2: then U=9\n\n- D=1, S=0: U=10\n\n- D=1, S=0: U=10, but U - D =10-1=9, U+D+S=10+1+0=11.\n\n- D=0, S=2: U=9, U+D+S=9+0+2=11.\n\n- D=1, S=0: U=10.\n\n- D=2, S=-2 impossible.\n\nSo possible: (U,D,S) = (9,0,2) or (10,1,0)\n\nNow, (10,1,0) means 10U and 1D, so net +9, but with one down, we go down once, so we might be lower, which could be worse for reaching high early.\n\n(9,0,2) with two stays, we can delay.\n\nProbably easier with two stays.\n\nWe might use row6 which is always safe.\n\nNow, H=11, t from 0 to 11, y_11=9.\n\ny_t for t=1 to 10 need to be safe when on freeway.\n\nNow, at t=4 and t=5, we need to be on y=5,6,7,8.\n\nSimilarly, at t=2, need to avoid y=5,7,8.\n\nLet's plan the path.\n\nStart t=0, y=0.\n\nt=1: we can go to y=1 (U) or stay y=0 (S).\n\nIf we go to y=1 at t=1, safe.\n\nt=2: from y=1, we can go to y=2 (U), or stay y=1 (S), or down to y=0 (D).\n\nAt t=2, safe rows 1,2,3,4,6.\n\ny=1 or 2 are safe.\n\ny=0 also safe.\n\nBut we need to get higher later.\n\nt=3: from y_2, to y_3.\n\nAt t=3, safe rows 3,4,5,6,7,8; not 1,2.\n\nSo y_3 must be in {3,4,5,6,7,8}\n\nIf y_2=1, then to y_3, we can go U to 2, but y=2 unsafe at t=3, or S to 1, unsafe, or D to 0, safe but low.\n\nSo from y_2=1, to reach safe y_3, we must go to y=0? y=0 safe, but then y_3=0.\n\nBut y_3=0 is safe, but we need to get to high for t=4.\n\nIf y_2=2, then to y_3, U to 3, or S to 2 (unsafe), D to 1 (unsafe), so must go U to y_3=3.\n\nSimilarly, if y_2=0, from t=2 y_2=0, to y_3: U to 1, but y=1 unsafe at t=3, or S to 0, safe, or D invalid. So must go to y_3=0 or 1, but y=1 unsafe, so only S to y_3=0.\n\nThen y_3=0.\n\nBut then at t=4, we need y_4 >=5, but from y_3=0, y_4 <=1, impossible.\n\nSo to avoid this, at t=2, we must have y_2 such that we can reach y_3 in safe set.\n\nSpecifically, if y_2 <=2, then to y_3, we can only reach up to 3 if y_2=2 and U, but y=3 safe at t=3.\n\nBut from above, if y_2=1, we can only go to y_3=0,1,2 but all unsafe or low.\n\nIf y_2=1, actions:\n\na_2: U to y_3=2, but y=2 unsafe at t=3\n\nS to y_3=1, unsafe\n\nD to y_3=0, safe\n\nBut y_3=0, then hard to reach high.\n\nSimilarly, if y_2=0, similarly, y_3=0 or 1, both unsafe or low.\n\nSo to have a chance, at t=2, we should be at y_2=2 or higher, but y_2 cannot be 3,4 directly from t=1.\n\nFrom t=1, y_1.\n\nIf y_1=1, then y_2 can be 1 or 2 (S or U).\n\nIf y_1=0, y_2=0 or 1.\n\nBest to have y_2=2.\n\nSo let's set y_1=1 (a_0=U)\n\nThen at t=1, y=1, safe.\n\nThen a_1: U to y_2=2, or S to y_2=1.\n\nIf we go to y_2=2, then at t=2, y=2, safe.\n\nThen for t=3, from y_2=2, we must go U to y_3=3, since S or D unsafe.\n\ny_3=3 at t=3, row3 safe, yes.\n\nThen t=3, y=3.\n\nNow t=4: y_4 must be in {5,6,7,8}\n\nFrom y_3=3, we can go U to y_4=4, but y=4 at t=4 unsafe, or S to 3, unsafe, or D to 2, unsafe.\n\nAll options lead to unsafe or not in safe set.\n\ny_4=4 not in {5,6,7,8}, and unsafe.\n\nSo impossible from here.\n\nIf at t=2, we stay at y=1? But y_2=1 at t=2.\n\nt=2, y=1, row1 safe at t=2? Row1 unsafe at t=3,4,5, not t=2, so safe.\n\nThen at t=2, y=1.\n\nThen for t=3, from y_2=1, to y_3.\n\nAs above, we can only go to y_3=0 (D) or other unsafe, so must go D to y_3=0.\n\nThen y_3=0 at t=3, safe.\n\nBut then t=4, y_4 must be in {5,6,7,8}, but from y_3=0, y_4 <=1, impossible.\n\nStuck.\n\nSo to avoid this, we need to be higher earlier.\n\nBut how? We can stay at t=0 or t=1 to delay, but that makes us lower.\n\nFor example, at t=0, action S, stay at y=0 for t=1.\n\nt=1, y=0, safe.\n\nThen from here, to y_2, a_1: U to y_2=1, or S to y_2=0.\n\nIf U to y_2=1, then same as above, problem at t=3.\n\nIf S to y_2=0, then t=2, y=0, safe.\n\nThen to y_3, a_2: U to y_3=1, but at t=3, y=1 unsafe, or S to y_3=0, safe, or D invalid.\n\nSo only S to y_3=0 or U to y_3=1 unsafe, so must S to y_3=0.\n\nThen y_3=0, same problem for t=4.\n\nSo we need to reach a higher row by t=3.\n\nBut from start, by t=3, with 3 actions, we can be at most y=3, if U,U,U.\n\ny_0=0, a0 U to y1=1, a1 U to y2=2, a2 U to y3=3.\n\nThen at t=3, y=3, safe.\n\nBut at t=4, from y3=3, we need to be at y4=5 or higher, but we can only reach y4=4 at best, which is not safe.\n\nWith H=11, we have more actions, so we can be at y=4 at t=4 by staying earlier or something.\n\nLet's list the times.\n\nWe need at t=4, y4 >=5.\n\nSince we start from 0, to reach y4=5 at t=4, we need 5 steps up in 4 actions, impossible.\n\nMaximum y4=4 with 4 U from t=0.\n\ny0=0, after 4 actions, y4 <=4.\n\nWith S or D, lower.\n\nSo y4 <=4 for all paths.\n\nBut at t=4, we need y4 >=5, impossible.\n\ny4 is position at time t=4, after 4 actions from t=0.\n\ny4 <=4, since each action increases at most 1.\n\nBut at t=4, we must be on y=5,6,7,8 to be safe, but y4 <=4, so it's impossible to be on y>=5 at t=4.\n\nSimilarly at t=5, we need y5 >=5.\n\ny5 at time t=5, after 5 actions, y5 <=5.\n\nSo y5 <=5.\n\nAt t=5, safe rows 5,6,7,8, so y5 must be >=5, so y5=5 is possible.\n\ny5=5,6,7,8.\n\nSince y5 <=5, so y5=5 is possible and safe.\n\nSimilarly at t=4, y4 <=4, but we need y4 >=5, impossible, so we cannot be on freeway at t=4 at all? But y4 must be between 0 and 9, and if y4=0,1,2,3,4, all are either freeway and unsafe or y=0 safe but not freeway.\n\ny=0 is safe, but at t=4, if we are on y=0, it is safe, but then we are low.\n\nBut the requirement for t=4 is only that if we are on freeway, it must be safe, but if we are on y=0 or y=9, always safe.\n\nSo at t=4, we can be on y=0, which is safe, or on freeway 5,6,7,8 safe, but since y4 <=4, we cannot be on 5,6,7,8, so we must be on y=0,1,2,3,4.\n\nBut y=1,2,3,4 are all unsafe at t=4, since rows 1-4 unsafe.\n\ny=0 is safe.\n\nSo at t=4, the only safe position is y=0.\n\nSimilarly at t=5, we can be on y=5,6,7,8 or y=0 or y=9.\n\ny=5 is safe at t=5, since row5 unsafe only at t=2.\n\netc.\n\nSo for t=4, to be safe, we must be at y=0.\n\nSimilarly, at t=5, to be safe, we can be on y=5,6,7,8 or y=0,9, etc., but not on 1,2,3,4.\n\nBut since we need to go up, probably not y=0.\n\nNow, back to path.\n\nWith H=11, we can be at y=0 at t=4.\n\nThen from there, go up.\n\nBut let's outline.\n\nStart t=0, y=0.\n\nWe need to be at y=0 at t=4.\n\nAt t=4, y=0.\n\nThen from t=4, we can go up.\n\nBut at t=5, we need to be on safe position, which for freeway, y=5,6,7,8 safe, or y=0,9.\n\nBut y=0 at t=5 is safe, but low.\n\nTo reach y=9 by t=11.\n\nFrom t=4, y=0, to t=11, y=9, need +9 in 7 steps, so possible with 9U and some S or D, but net +9 in 7 steps, so U - D =9, U + D + S =7, impossible since U - D =9 >7.\n\nNumber of actions from t=4 to t=10 for y_11.\n\ny at t=4 is 0.\n\nThen actions a_4 to a_10, 7 actions, to y_11=9.\n\ny_11 = y_4 + sum of actions from t=4 to 10.\n\n7 actions, net change +9, impossible since max change +7.\n\ny_11 - y_4 =9, with 7 actions, each change at most +1, so y_11 <= y_4 +7 =0+7=7 <9, impossible.\n\nMistake.\n\ny_4 at t=4.\n\nThen after a_4, y_5; ... after a_10, y_11.\n\nSo from a_4 to a_10, 7 actions, determine y_5 to y_11.\n\ny_11 = y_4 + (U - D) for those actions.\n\nBut y_4=0, y_11=9, so U - D =9 with 7 actions, impossible.\n\nThus, we cannot have y_4=0.\n\nWe must not be on freeway at t=4, but we can be on y=0, but if we are on y=0 at t=4, we cannot reach y=9 by t=11 with only 7 actions.\n\nSimilarly, if we are on y=1 at t=4, y_11=9, need +8 in 7 actions, U-D=8, possible only if 8U and 1D or something, but U+D+S=7, U-D=8, then 2U+S=15, U-D=8, so U=8, D=0, S= -1 impossible; or U=9, D=1, S= -3 impossible. No, U-D=8, U+D+S=7, subtract: 2D+S = -1 impossible.\n\nSo impossible to have y_4 <=1 and reach y_11=9.\n\nSimilarly, if y_4=2, need +7 in 7 actions, U-D=7, U+D+S=7, so U=7, D=0, S=0.\n\nSimilarly, y_4=3, need +6 in 7 actions, possible with U=6, D=0, S=1 or U=7,D=1,S=0 etc.\n\nBut at t=4, we must be at y=0 to be safe, but y=0 requires y_4=0, which cannot reach y=9 at t=11.\n\nContradiction.\n\nWhat's wrong?\n\nAt t=4, if we are on y=0, it is safe, but then we are behind schedule.\n\nWith H=11, we have more time, so we can be lower at t=4.\n\nFor example, at t=4, y=0, then from t=4 to t=11, 7 actions, to go from y=0 to y=9, need net +9, but only 7 actions, impossible.\n\nMinimum actions to go from y=0 to y=9 is 9 actions, so from t=4 to t=11, only 7 actions, so at t=11, y_11 <= y_4 +7.\n\nIf y_4=0, y_11<=7<9, cannot reach 9.\n\nIf y_4=1, y_11<=8<9.\n\nIf y_4=2, y_11<=9, so possible only if y_4=2 and all U from there, y_11=9.\n\nSimilarly, if y_4=3, y_11<=10, but y=9 at t=11, so can be.\n\nBut at t=4, we must be at y=0 to be safe, but y=0 not possible, as above.\n\nWe can be on other safe positions, but at t=4, safe positions are y=0 or y=5,6,7,8.\n\nBut y=5,6,7,8 require y_4 >=5, but y_4 <=4, impossible.\n\nSo only possible safe position at t=4 is y=0.\n\nBut y=0 at t=4 requires that we can reach y=9 at t=11 only if y_4=2 or higher, but y=0<2, impossible.\n\nThus, for any path, at t=4, y_4 <=4, and to be safe, must have y_4=0, but then cannot reach y=9 by t=11 with only 7 actions.\n\nWith H=11, t=11 is after 11 actions from t=0, so from t=0 to t=11, 11 steps.\n\ny_4 at t=4, after 4 actions, y_4 <=4.\n\ny_11 at t=11, after 11 actions, y_11=9.\n\nFrom t=4 to t=11, there are 7 actions (a_4 to a_10) determining y_5 to y_11.\n\ny_11 = y_4 + net change from actions a_4 to a_10.\n\nNet change <= +7.\n\nSo y_11 <= y_4 +7.\n\nSince y_11=9, so 9 <= y_4 +7, thus y_4 >=2.\n\nSimilarly, y_4 <=4.\n\nSo y_4 must be 2,3, or 4.\n\nBut at t=4, to be safe, since y=2,3,4 are all on freeway and unsafe at t=4, and y=0 is safe but y_4>=2, so y_4 cannot be 0, so must be 2,3, or 4, all unsafe at t=4.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to be safe at t=4 for any path with H=11.\n\nBut this can't be right; there must be a way.\n\nPerhaps I missed that at t=4, if we are not on freeway, but y=4 is freeway.\n\nOr perhaps we can be on row6, but y=6 requires y_4=6>4, impossible.\n\nSo indeed, at t=4, for any position, if y_4 in 1-4, it is unsafe, and y_4=0 is safe but not achievable with y_4>=2 for reaching y=9 at t=11.\n\ny_4>=2 from above, so y_4 in 2,3,4, all unsafe.\n\nSo collision at t=4 inevitable?\n\nBut that can't be; we can avoid by being on a different row or at a different time.\n\nFor example, if we are on row6 at t=4, but row6 is always safe, but to be on row6 at t=4, we need to have moved faster, but we can't, since from t=0, max y_4=4.\n\nUnless we start from higher, but we start at 0.\n\nPerhaps with more turns, we can be at row6 at a later time, but at t=4, we must be somewhere.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps at t=4, we are moving to a new row, but the collision check is at the beginning of the turn, based on current y_t.\n\nSo when we are at y_t at start of turn, we check collision for that row at that time.\n\nSo at t=4, whatever y_4 is, we check.\n\nAnd if y_4 in 1-4, it is unsafe.\n\ny_4=0 or 5-9 or 9, but 5-9 impossible at t=4.\n\nSo only possibility is y_4=0, but then we can't reach y=9 in time.\n\nWith H larger, we can.\n\nFor example, H=12.\n\nThen at t=4, we can be at y=0, then from there, with 8 actions to go to y=9, possible with 9U and some S/D, but net +9 in 8 actions, U-D=9, U+D+S=8, so U=9, D=0, S= -1 impossible, or U=8.5 not integer, impossible.\n\nU-D=9, U+D+S=8, subtract, 2D+S= -1 impossible.\n\nSo with H=12, from y_4=0, to y_12=9, 8 actions, net +9, impossible.\n\nSimilarly, only if y_4 is higher.\n\nWith H=12, y_12=9, so y_12 <= y_4 +8, so 9 <= y_4 +8, thus y_4 >=1.\n\nIf y_4=0, y_12<=8<9.\n\nSo y_4 >=1.\n\nAt t=4, y_4>=1, and if y_4 in 1-4, unsafe, y_4=0 not possible, so must be unsafe.\n\nBut y_4=5-8 impossible.\n\nSo for any H, at t=4, y_4 <=4, and to be safe, must have y_4=0, but y_4=0 only if we have fewer U actions, but to reach y=9, we need many U, so y_4 cannot be 0 if H is small.\n\nBut for larger H, y_4 can be 0, but then we need even more actions to reach y=9.\n\nLet's solve the inequality.\n\nSuppose we reach y=9 at time T.\n\nThen y_T =9.\n\ny_4 <=4.\n\nAt t=4, to be safe, we need y_4 =0 or y_4 >=5, but y_4 <=4, so y_4=0.\n\nSo we must have y_4=0.\n\nThen from y_4=0 to y_T=9, we need at least 9 actions after t=4.\n\nActions from t=4 to t+T-1 or something.\n\ny at time 4 is y_4.\n\nThen after actions a_4 to a_{T-1}, we have y_T.\n\nNumber of actions from a_4 to a_{T-1} is (T-1) - 4 +1 = T-4.\n\nFor example, from t=4 to t=T, there are T-4 actions? Let's see.\n\nAfter a_4, y_5; after a_5, y_6; ... after a_{T-1}, y_T.\n\nSo actions a_4 to a_{T-1}, number of actions: (T-1) - 4 +1 = T-4 actions.\n\ny_T = y_4 + net change from these actions.\n\nNet change <= T-4.\n\ny_T=9, y_4=0, so 9 <= 0 + (T-4), so T-4 >=9, T>=13.\n\nSimilarly, net change >= -(T-4), but we need +9, so T-4 >=9, T>=13.\n\nSo minimum T=13, with 9U and 0S0D in the 9 actions.\n\nWith T=13, we can have y_4=0, then from t=4 to t=13, 9 actions, all U, to go to y_13=9.\n\nBut we need to have y_4=0.\n\nAnd at t=4, y=0 safe.\n\nThen we need to ensure that from t=0 to t=4, we can be at y=0 at t=4 with no collision.\n\nSimilarly for other times.\n\nFirst, let's set T=13, arrive at y=9 at t=13.\n\nThen actions from t=0 to t=12.\n\ny_0=0\n\ny_13=9\n\nWith 13 actions, U - D =9, U+D+S=13.\n\nSo U - D =9, U+D+S=13, subtract: 2D + S =4.\n\nSo possible (U,D,S) = (9,0,4), (10,1,2), (11,2,0), etc.\n\nNow, we can have y_4=0.\n\nAt t=4, y=0, safe.\n\nWe need to reach y_4=0 from y_0=0 in 4 actions.\n\nWith net change 0, so U-D=0 for the first 4 actions.\n\nU+D+S=4.\n\nU-D=0, so U=D, then 2U + S=4.\n\nPossible: U=0,D=0,S=4; or U=1,D=1,S=2; U=2,D=2,S=0.\n\nNow, we need to avoid collision at t=1,2,3.\n\nt=1: all rows safe, so y_1 whatever.\n\nt=2: safe rows 1,2,3,4,6; not 5,7,8.\n\nt=3: safe rows 3,4,5,6,7,8; not 1,2.\n\nAlso, at t=4, we are at y=0.\n\nNow, let's define the actions.\n\nStart t=0, y=0.\n\nTo have y_4=0, we can, for example, stay for 4 turns.\n\nBut at t=1, y=0, safe.\n\nt=2, y=0, safe (since not freeway).\n\nt=3, y=0, safe.\n\nt=4, y=0, safe.\n\nThen from here, we can go up.\n\nBut we need to go to y=9 by t=13.\n\nFrom t=4 to t=13, 9 actions, all U, so y_t for t=5 to 13: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9.\n\nNow, check for each t, if on freeway, safe.\n\nt=5: y=1, row1 unsafe at t=5? Row1 unsafe at t=3,4,5,12,13,14.\n\nt=5, row1 unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, at t=5, y=1, row1 unsafe, collision.\n\nProblem.\n\nAt t=5, we are at y=1, but row1 unsafe at t=5.\n\nSimilarly, t=6: y=2, row2 unsafe at t=3,4,5,12,13,14, t=6 not, safe.\n\nt=7: y=3, row3 unsafe at t=4,5, t=7 safe.\n\nt=8: y=4, row4 unsafe at t=4,5, t=8 safe.\n\nt=9: y=5, row5 unsafe at t=2, t=9 safe.\n\nt=10: y=6, row6 always safe.\n\nt=11: y=7, row7 unsafe at t=2, t=11 safe.\n\nt=12: y=8, row8 unsafe at t=2, t=12 safe.\n\nt=13: y=9, safe.\n\nBut at t=5, y=1, unsafe.\n\nSo we need to avoid being on row1 at t=5.\n\nSince we have extra actions, we can stay at some point.\n\nFor example, from t=4, y=0, instead of going directly up, we can stay at y=0 longer or something.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9 at t=13.\n\nFrom t=4, y=0, to t=13, y=9, with 9 actions.\n\nIf we go up continuously, we are at y=1 at t=5, unsafe.\n\nSo we can delay the ascent.\n\nFor example, at t=4, y=0, we can stay at y=0 for one more turn.\n\nBut t=4, action a_4, if S, then y_5=0.\n\nThen at t=5, y=0, safe.\n\nThen from here, we can go up.\n\nBut we have only 8 actions left to reach y=9 by t=13, impossible because 8 actions max +8, from y=0 to y=8<9.\n\ny_5=0, then actions a_5 to a_12, 8 actions, to y_13=9, net +9 in 8 actions, impossible.\n\nIf we stay at t=4, y_5=0, then we are behind.\n\nWith T=13, from y_4=0, we have to go up in 9 actions to y_13=9, so we must increase by 1 each step from t=5 to t=13, y_t = t-4 for t=5 to 13? y_5=1, y_6=2, ..., y_13=9.\n\nBut at t=5, y=1, unsafe.\n\nTo avoid, we can be at a different row at t=5.\n\nBut at t=5, safe rows are 5,6,7,8 or y=0,9.\n\nIf we are at y=0 at t=5, then we can go up, but then at t=6, y=1, row1 safe at t=6? Yes.\n\nBut from y=0 at t=5, to y=9 at t=13, need +9 in 8 actions, impossible.\n\nSo we must be on y=5 or higher at t=5 to be safe and able to reach.\n\nBut at t=5, from the path, we are at low y.\n\nPerhaps start going up earlier but slower.\n\nLet's list the critical points.\n\nThe problem times are t=2,4,5.\n\nAt t=2, we can be on y=0,1,2,3,4,6 safe.\n\nAt t=4, only y=0 safe.\n\nAt t=5, y=0,5,6,7,8,9 safe; not 1,2,3,4.\n\nTo satisfy t=4, we must be at y=0 at t=4.\n\nThen at t=5, we can be at y=0 or y=5, etc., but from y=0, we can only go to y=1, which is unsafe at t=5.\n\nSo at t=5, if we are at y=0, we can stay or go up to y=1.\n\ny=1 unsafe at t=5, so we must stay at y=0 at t=5.\n\nBut then we are stuck at low y.\n\nWith more turns, we can stay at y=0 for multiple turns.\n\nFor example, at t=4, y=0.\n\nAt t=5, we stay at y=0, safe.\n\nThen at t=6, we can start going up.\n\nBut with T=13, y_13=9.\n\nFrom t=6, y=0, to t=13, 8 actions, to y=9, net +9 in 8 actions, impossible.\n\nSo T must be larger.\n\nSuppose we reach y=9 at time T.\n\ny_4=0.\n\nThen from t=4 to t=T, number of actions: T-4.\n\ny_T = y_4 + net change = 0 + net <= T-4.\n\ny_T=9, so 9 <= T-4, T>=13.\n\nEquality when net change = T-4, so all U, no S/D.\n\nBut then y_t for t=5 to T must be t-4, but at t=5, y=1, unsafe for T=13.\n\nTo avoid that, we need to have a different y at t=5.\n\nBut with all U, y_5=1.\n\nSo we must insert a Stay or Down before t=5 or after.\n\nBut before t=5, we are at low y.\n\nFor example, at t=4, y=0, we can have a_4=S, then y_5=0.\n\nThen at t=5, y=0, safe.\n\nThen from here, to reach y=9 at T, we need more actions.\n\nWith y_5=0, y_T=9, net +9 in (T-5) actions.\n\nNet <= T-5, so 9 <= T-5, T>=14.\n\nSimilarly, with T=14, net +9 in 9 actions, all U, so y_t for t=6 to 14: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9.\n\nNow check safety:\n\nt=6: y=1, row1 unsafe at t=3,4,5,12,13,14. t=6 not, safe.\n\nt=7: y=2, row2 unsafe at t=3,4,5,12,13,14, t=7 safe.\n\nt=8: y=3, row3 unsafe at t=4,5, t=8 safe.\n\nt=9: y=4, row4 unsafe at t=4,5, t=9 safe.\n\nt=10: y=5, row5 unsafe at t=2, t=10 safe.\n\nt=11: y=6, safe.\n\nt=12: y=7, row7 unsafe at t=2, t=12 safe.\n\nt=13: y=8, row8 unsafe at t=2, t=13 safe.\n\nt=14: y=9, safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nNow, we need to be at y=0 at t=4 and t=5.\n\nFrom t=0 to t=4, we need to have y_4=0.\n\nWith 4 actions, net change 0.\n\nAlso avoid collision at t=1,2,3.\n\nt=0: y=0\n\nActions a0 to a3 for y1 to y4.\n\ny4=0.\n\nNet U-D=0 for first 4 actions.\n\nU+D+S=4.\n\nU-D=0, so U=D, 2U+S=4.\n\nPossible actions:\n\n- 2U, 2D, 0S\n\n- 1U,1D,2S\n\n- 0U,0D,4S\n\nBut y must stay within 0 to 9.\n\nAlso, at each t, position safe.\n\nt=1: y1, whatever, safe since all rows safe at t=1.\n\nt=2: y2 must be in safe rows: 0,1,2,3,4,6 (since y=0 safe)\n\nt=3: y3 must be in safe rows: 0,3,4,5,6,7,8 (not 1,2)\n\nAnd y4=0.\n\nNow, let's find a sequence.\n\nSuppose we stay at y=0 for all 4 turns.\n\nThen a0=S, y1=0\n\na1=S, y2=0\n\na2=S, y3=0\n\na3=S, y4=0\n\nAll at y=0, safe for t=1,2,3.\n\nGood.\n\nThen from t=4, y=0\n\na4=S, to y5=0 (since we need y5=0 for t=5)\n\nt=5, y=0, safe.\n\nThen a5=U, to y6=1\n\nt=6, y=1, safe as above.\n\na6=U, to y7=2\n\nt=7, y=2, safe.\n\na7=U, to y8=3\n\nt=8, y=3, safe.\n\na8=U, to y9=4\n\nt=9, y=4, safe.\n\na9=U, to y10=5\n\nt=10, y=5, safe.\n\na10=U, to y11=6\n\nt=11, y=6, safe.\n\na11=U, to y12=7\n\nt=12, y=7, safe.\n\na12=U, to y13=8\n\nt=13, y=8, safe? At t=13, row8 unsafe at t=2, but t=13, safe.\n\nThen a13=U, to y14=9\n\nBut we reach y14=9 at t=14.\n\nWith T=14.\n\nBut we have actions from t=0 to t=13 for y14.\n\nIn the sequence, actions a_t for t=0 to H-1, position at H.\n\nHere H=14, actions a0 to a13, y14=9.\n\nIn the above, at t=13, y13=8, then a13=U to y14=9.\n\nNow, we need to output the actions from t1=0.\n\nIn the sequence, for the first part, we have S at t=0,1,2,3; then S at t=4; then U from t=5 to t=13.\n\nBut t=4 action is a4=S, to keep y5=0.\n\nLet's list the turns.\n\nTurn t: action a_t, then position at t+1.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t.\n\nAfter action a_t, position y_{t+1}.\n\nIn the sequence, we need a_t for t=0 to 13.\n\nAnd y_t for t=0 to 14, but we care about collision at each turn based on y_t.\n\nNow, with the above:\n\nt=0: y=0, action a0=S, then y1=0\n\nt=1: y=0, action a1=S, then y2=0\n\nt=2: y=0, action a2=S, then y3=0\n\nt=3: y=0, action a3=S, then y4=0\n\nt=4: y=0, action a4=S, then y5=0\n\nt=5: y=0, action a5=U, then y6=1\n\nt=6: y=1, action a6=U, then y7=2\n\nt=7: y=2, action a7=U, then y8=3\n\nt=8: y=3, action a8=U, then y9=4\n\nt=9: y=4, action a9=U, then y10=5\n\nt=10: y=5, action a10=U, then y11=6\n\nt=11: y=6, action a11=U, then y12=7\n\nt=12: y=7, action a12=U, then y13=8\n\nt=13: y=8, action a13=U, then y14=9\n\nNow, check collision:\n\nt=0: y=0, safe\n\nt=1: y=0, safe\n\nt=2: y=0, safe\n\nt=3: y=0, safe\n\nt=4: y=0, safe\n\nt=5: y=0, safe\n\nt=6: y=1, row1 at t=6: unsafe times 3,4,5,12,13,14; t=6 not, safe\n\nt=7: y=2, row2 unsafe at t=3,4,5,12,13,14; t=7 not, safe\n\nt=8: y=3, row3 unsafe at t=4,5; t=8 not, safe\n\nt=9: y=4, row4 unsafe at t=4,5; t=9 not, safe\n\nt=10: y=5, row5 unsafe at t=2; t=10 not, safe\n\nt=11: y=6, safe\n\nt=12: y=7, row7 unsafe at t=2; t=12 not, safe\n\nt=13: y=8, row8 unsafe at t=2; t=13 not, safe\n\nt=14: y=9, safe, but we don't care after action.\n\nThe collision is checked at turn t based on y_t, before action.\n\nAt t=14, if we were there, but we reach at t=14, and actions up to t=13, so last check at t=13.\n\nAll safe.\n\nH=14 turns? Number of actions: from t=0 to t=13, 14 actions, reach y14=9.\n\nBut we can reduce.\n\nFor example, at the beginning, we stayed from t=0 to t=5 at y=0, but we can start going up earlier as long as we avoid unsafe times.\n\nSpecifically, at t=6, we go to y=1, which is safe.\n\nBut we can go up before if possible.\n\nFor example, at t=1, we can go to y=1, safe.\n\nBut then at t=2, we need to be safe, etc.\n\nBut since we need to be at y=0 at t=4 and t=5, we might not go up before.\n\nt=4 and t=5 we are at y=0.\n\nFrom t=0 to t=3, we can be at other positions, but as long as we return to y=0 at t=4.\n\nFor example, we can go up and down.\n\nBut to minimize H, staying at y=0 might be fine, but we can arrive earlier? With H=14, but perhaps we can reach faster.\n\nSince row6 is always safe, we can go to row6 quickly and stay there during critical times.\n\nBut at t=4, we must be at y=0, so we cannot be on row6 at t=4.\n\nBut with the above path, it works with H=14.\n\nBut let's see if we can do with less.\n\nSuppose T=13.\n\nThen y_13=9.\n\ny_4=0.\n\nFrom y_4=0 to y_13=9, 9 actions, all U, so y_t for t=5 to 13: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9.\n\nThen at t=5, y=1, row1 unsafe, collision.\n\nTo avoid, we can be at a different row at t=5.\n\nBut with all U, we are at y=1.\n\nSo we must have a Stay or Down before or at t=5.\n\nFor example, at t=4, y=0, instead of U, we do S, then y_5=0.\n\nBut then y_5=0, and with 8 actions to y_13=9, impossible to reach.\n\nIf we do Down at some point, but we need net up.\n\nNot possible for T=13.\n\nThus minimum T=14.\n\nWith the sequence above.\n\nBut in the sequence, we have many S at beginning.\n\nWe can reduce the stays.\n\nFor example, from t=0 to t=4, we need y_4=0 with net zero.\n\nWe can do, for instance, go up and down.\n\nBut not necessary.\n\nSince at t=2, we can be on y=6, for example.\n\nBut let's not complicate.\n\nThe minimal H is 14.\n\nNow, for the actions, in the above sequence, we have S from t=0 to t=4 (5 actions? t=0 to t=4 actions for y1 to y5? Let's list actions properly.\n\nActions a_t for t=0 to 13:\n\na0: S, y1=0\n\na1: S, y2=0\n\na2: S, y3=0\n\na3: S, y4=0\n\na4: S, y5=0\n\na5: U, y6=1\n\na6: U, y7=2\n\na7: U, y8=3\n\na8: U, y9=4\n\na9: U, y10=5\n\na10: U, y11=6\n\na11: U, y12=7\n\na12: U, y13=8\n\na13: U, y14=9\n\nBut we have 14 actions, but we can start going up earlier.\n\nFor example, at t=0, we can go U to y1=1.\n\nThen at t=1, y=1, safe.\n\nThen at t=1, we can go U to y2=2, or S to 1, or D to 0.\n\nBut at t=2, y=2 is safe.\n\nThen from y2=2, at t=2, we need to go to y3, but at t=3, y3 must not be 1 or 2, so we must go U to y3=3.\n\nThen at t=3, y=3, safe.\n\nThen at t=3, to go to y4, but at t=4, we need y4=0, but from y3=3, we can go D to y4=2, but y=2 at t=4 unsafe, or S to 3 unsafe, U to 4 unsafe, all unsafe or not 0.\n\nCannot reach y4=0 directly.\n\nFrom y3=3, we can go D to y4=2, but unsafe.\n\nNot good.\n\nGo down earlier.\n\nFor example:\n\nt=0: y=0, a0=U, y1=1\n\nt=1: y=1, a1=D, y2=0\n\nThen t=2: y=0, safe.\n\nThen a2=S, y3=0\n\nt=3: y=0, a3=S, y4=0\n\nThen same as before.\n\nBut we used D, which might not be efficient, but net same.\n\nThen continue.\n\nBut in terms of number of actions, same as staying.\n\nWe can be at y=6 at some point, but not necessary.\n\nSo the sequence with all S until t=4 and t=5 is fine.\n\nBut at t=4, we have a4=S to keep y5=0.\n\nNow, to output the actions.\n\nThe current turn is t1=0, player at (0,0).\n\nWe need minimal H, which is 14.\n\nSequence of actions: from t=0 to t=13.\n\nBut in the answer format, for turn t1 + t.\n\nt1=0.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 0: S\n\nTurn 1: S\n\nTurn 2: S\n\nTurn 3: S\n\nTurn 4: S\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nWith H=14 actions.\n\nBut we can remove some S if not needed.\n\nFor example, at the beginning, we can go up to y=3 or something, but since we need to be low at t=4, it doesn't help.\n\nPerhaps we can go to row6 during the critical times, but at t=4 we must be at y=0.\n\nAnother idea: at t=3, we can be at y=6, which is safe, then at t=4, we need to go down to y=0, but y=5,4,etc unsafe.\n\nNot possible.\n\nSo I think the sequence is acceptable.\n\nBut let's confirm the car states at t=5 for row1, etc., but in our path, we are not on row1 at t=5, we are at y=0.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nPerhaps we can start going up later but with fewer stays.\n\nBut H=14 seems minimal.\n\nIn the actions, from t=5 to t=13, we have 9 U, but t=5 action to y6=1, up to t=13 action to y14=9.\n\nNumber of U is 9, from a5 to a13.\n\na5 to a13 is 9 actions, all U.\n\nAnd before, 5 S.\n\nBut we can have less S at beginning.\n\nFor example, suppose we go up to y=2 at t=2.\n\nt=0: a0=U, y1=1\n\nt=1: a1=U, y2=2\n\nt=2: y=2, safe (t=2 row2 safe)\n\nThen at t=2, we need to go to y3, at t=3 y3 must be not 1 or 2, so U to y3=3.\n\nt=3: y=3, safe.\n\nThen at t=3, to reach y4=0, we need to go down twice, but we can only go down to y4=2 at best, which is unsafe at t=4.\n\nIf we go D to y4=2, unsafe.\n\nNot possible.\n\nGo down earlier.\n\nt=0: a0=U, y1=1\n\nt=1: a1=D, y2=0\n\nt=2: a2=S, y3=0\n\nt=3: a3=S, y4=0\n\nThen same as before.\n\nNo gain.\n\nSo the first sequence is fine.\n\nThus minimal H=14.\n\nNow for the answer.\n\nThe sequence of actions from turn t1=0.\n\nIn the boxed format.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 0: S\n\nTurn 1: S\n\nTurn 2: S\n\nTurn 3: S\n\nTurn 4: S\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nBut we can write it as:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 0: & S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 1: & S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 2: & S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 3: & S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 4: & S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 5: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: & U \\end{array} }\n\nIn the sequence, turn 5: U, which is at t=5, action U, to go to y6=1.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSince the player reaches at turn 14, position at turn 14.\n\nBut the actions are for turns 0 to 13.\n\nI think that's the minimal.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from \\((0, 0)\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\) is 14. This is achieved by staying at \\(y = 0\\) for the first 5 turns to avoid unsafe freeway positions during critical times, specifically ensuring the player is not on any freeway row at \\(t = 4\\) and \\(t = 5\\) when multiple rows are unsafe. After \\(t = 5\\), the player moves up one row per turn to reach \\(y = 9\\) at \\(t = 14\\).\n\nThe unsafe times for each freeway row are derived from the car states at \\(t_1 = 0\\):\n- Row 1: unsafe at \\(t = 3, 4, 5, 12, 13, 14\\)\n- Row 2: unsafe at \\(t = 3, 4, 5, 12, 13, 14\\)\n- Row 3: unsafe at \\(t = 4, 5\\)\n- Row 4: unsafe at \\(t = 4, 5\\)\n- Row 5: unsafe at \\(t = 2\\)\n- Row 6: always safe\n- Row 7: unsafe at \\(t = 2\\)\n- Row 8: unsafe at \\(t = 2\\)\n\nKey unsafe periods:\n- At \\(t = 2\\), rows 5, 7, and 8 are unsafe.\n- At \\(t = 4\\) and \\(t = 5\\), rows 1, 2, 3, and 4 are unsafe.\n\nThe sequence ensures:\n- From \\(t = 0\\) to \\(t = 5\\), the player remains at \\(y = 0\\) (safe, as it is not a freeway).\n- At \\(t = 5\\), moving to \\(y = 1\\) is safe because row 1 is not unsafe at \\(t = 6\\).\n- Subsequent moves up each row are timed to avoid unsafe times:\n  - \\(y = 1\\) at \\(t = 6\\): row 1 safe (\\(t = 6\\) not unsafe)\n  - \\(y = 2\\) at \\(t = 7\\): row 2 safe (\\(t = 7\\) not unsafe)\n  - \\(y = 3\\) at \\(t = 8\\): row 3 safe (\\(t = 8\\) not unsafe)\n  - \\(y = 4\\) at \\(t = 9\\): row 4 safe (\\(t = 9\\) not unsafe)\n  - \\(y = 5\\) at \\(t = 10\\): row 5 safe (\\(t = 10\\) not unsafe)\n  - \\(y = 6\\) at \\(t = 11\\): row 6 always safe\n  - \\(y = 7\\) at \\(t = 12\\): row 7 safe (\\(t = 12\\) not unsafe)\n  - \\(y = 8\\) at \\(t = 13\\): row 8 safe (\\(t = 13\\) not unsafe)\n  - \\(y = 9\\) at \\(t = 14\\): safe (not a freeway)\n\nThe sequence of actions for turns \\(t_1 + t = 0\\) to \\(13\\) (where \\(t_1 = 0\\)) is:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 0: & S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 1: & S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 2: & S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 3: & S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 4: & S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 5: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: & U \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t₁ = 3, and I start at y=0.\n\nFirst, I should understand how the cars move. All cars are moving right, according to the table. For right-moving cars, the span at time T is [τ + s(T - t₁), h + s(T - t₁)], since it says for right-moving: Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t₁), h + s(T-t₁)].\n\nIn the car update, for right-moving: Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t₁), h + s(T-t₁)]. But τ is the tail and h is the head? In the initial state, for example, freeway 1: (-48, -59, right, 4). -48 to -59, but -48 is greater than -59, so if it's right-moving, the head should be at a higher x, right? Let's see the numbers.\n\nFor freeway 1: cars (-48, -59, right, 4). -48 is to the right of -59 since x increases to the right, I assume. But typically, we think x increasing to the right, so -59 is left, -48 is right, so head at -48, tail at -59? But in the span, for right-moving, it says [τ, h] initially, and then [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT].\n\nIn the initial state, it says \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\", so for freeway 1, first car: head h = -48, tail τ = -59, direction right, speed 4.\n\nBut if head is at -48 and tail at -59, and it's moving right, then at time T, span is [τ + s(T-t₁), h + s(T-t₁)] = [-59 + 4(T-3), -48 + 4(T-3)].\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T only if the player is at y_T = k, and 0 is in the span of some car on freeway k at time T.\n\nAlso, when moving, if I move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, I'm not on y_{T+1} at time T, so I don't collide with cars there at that time.\n\nI start at y=0 at time t₁=3. I need to reach y=9.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are not freeways, so no cars there. Freeways are y=1 to 8.\n\nSo I need to pass through y=1 to 8 without colliding.\n\nThe player update: at each turn, I choose action U, D, or S, which changes y by +1, -1, or 0, but y is clamped to [0,9], so I can't go below 0 or above 9.\n\nSince I start at 0 and want to go to 9, I probably want to go up most of the time.\n\nBut I have to avoid the cars on the freeways when I'm on them.\n\nNow, the collision condition: at turn T, if I am on freeway y_T = k, and for some car on k, 0 is in its span at time T.\n\nThe span is the positions it occupies at that time.\n\nAlso, when I move, if I change y, I'm not on the new row until the next turn.\n\nLet me denote time from t₁=3.\n\nSet τ = T - t₁ = T - 3, so at τ=0, it's turn t₁=3.\n\nAt τ=0, player at y=0.\n\nAfter each action, y changes.\n\nLet me define the state at the beginning of each turn.\n\nAt the start of turn T, player is at position (0, y_T).\n\nThen I choose action a_T, which determines Δy for that turn.\n\nThen y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy, clamped to [0,9].\n\nThe collision is checked during the turn, I think, based on y_T and the car positions at time T.\n\nThe problem says: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd \"turn T\" corresponds to time T.\n\nAlso, \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T\", so at turn T, you are on y_T for collision purposes.\n\nSo, at each turn T, you are on row y_T, and you collide if for that row, 0 is in some car's span at time T.\n\nThen after the action, you move to y_{T+1} for the next turn.\n\nNow, I need to find a sequence of actions from turn t₁=3 onwards, to reach y=9 in min H turns, meaning after H actions, y_{t₁ + H} = 9.\n\nLet's see the sequence.\n\nAt turn t₁, position is (0, y_{t₁}), which is (0,0) for us.\n\nThen I take action a_{t₁}, which affects the move to y_{t₁ +1}.\n\nThe position after action is for the next turn.\n\nBut collision is based on current turn position.\n\nI need y_{t₁ + H} = 9, so after H actions, at turn t₁ + H, y is 9.\n\nThe sequence of actions is from t = t₁ to t = t₁ + H - 1, so H actions, and after H actions, at time t₁ + H, y=9.\n\nIn the answer format, it says {a_{t₁ + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}, so t from 0 to H-1, so actions at times t₁, t₁+1, ..., t₁+H-1, and after that, at time t₁+H, y=9.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, for the cars, at any time T, for each freeway, the car spans are as given.\n\nSince all cars are moving right, and we care about when 0 is in their span.\n\nFor a car with initial head h, tail τ, speed s, at time T, span is [τ + s(T - t₁), h + s(T - t₁)] for right-moving, since d is right for all.\n\nIn the table, all cars are right-moving, yes.\n\nt₁ = 3, so ΔT = T - 3.\n\nFor a car, 0 is in span at T if min(span) <= 0 <= max(span), but since it's an interval, 0 ∈ [left, right] where left and right are the endpoints.\n\nFor right-moving car, span at T is [τ + s(T-3), h + s(T-3)].\n\nSince h and τ, with h > τ for right-moving? In the initial, for example, freeway 1: head -48, tail -59, so -48 > -59, so head is right, tail is left, so span is [tail, head] = [-59, -48] at T=3.\n\nThen at T, span = [-59 + s(T-3), -48 + s(T-3)].\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\n0 is in span if τ + s(T-3) <= 0 <= h + s(T-3)\n\nSince h > τ, it's τ + sΔT <= 0 <= h + sΔT, with ΔT = T-3.\n\nSimilarly for other cars.\n\nNow, for each freeway and each car, I can find when 0 is in the span.\n\nBut since multiple cars per freeway, I need to know if at time T, for freeway k, there is any car with 0 in span.\n\nIf yes, then if player is on row k at time T, collision.\n\nOtherwise safe.\n\nNow, I start at y=0 at T=3.\n\ny=0 is not a freeway, so no collision possible at y=0 or y=9.\n\nI need to go to y=9, so I must pass through y=1 to 8.\n\nEach move changes y by at most 1, so I need at least 9 moves to go from 0 to 9, but I can stay or move down, but that would take more moves, so min H should be 9 if possible, but I have to avoid collisions, so it might take more if I have to wait.\n\nBut let's see if I can do it in 9 moves.\n\nH is the number of actions, so to go from y=0 to y=9, min actions is 9 if all up, but since I start at turn T=3, after 9 actions, at T=12, y=9.\n\nBut I might have to stay or move down to avoid, which adds turns.\n\nFirst, let's list for each freeway k=1 to 8, and for each time T, whether row k is occupied, meaning if 0 is in some car span on row k at time T.\n\nSince the cars are moving, I can find for each k, the times when it is unsafe.\n\nThen I need that when I am on row k at time T, it is safe, i.e., not occupied.\n\nAlso, since I move one row at a time, the path must be a sequence of rows.\n\nNow, let's compute for each freeway the occupation.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: cars: (-48,-59,right,4), (-12,-23,right,4), (24,13,right,4)\n\nSpeed all 4.\n\nAt time T, span for first car: [ -59 + 4(T-3), -48 + 4(T-3) ]\n\n0 in span if -59 +4(ΔT) <= 0 <= -48 +4(ΔT) with ΔT = T-3\n\nSimilarly for second car: [ -23 +4(ΔT), -12 +4(ΔT) ]\n\n0 in if -23 +4ΔT <= 0 <= -12 +4ΔT\n\nThird car: [13 +4ΔT, 24 +4ΔT] since τ=13? Head=24, tail=13, so [13 +4ΔT, 24 +4ΔT]\n\n0 in if 13 +4ΔT <= 0 <= 24 +4ΔT, but 13 +4ΔT >=13>0 for ΔT>=0, so 0 <= 13+4ΔT is false, so never occupied by third car, since min is at least 13.\n\nSimilarly, for first car: -59 +4ΔT <=0 <= -48 +4ΔT\n\n-59 +4ΔT <=0 => 4ΔT <=59 => ΔT <= 59/4 = 14.75, so ΔT <=14 since integer? T is integer turn, so ΔT integer.\n\nSimilarly, 0 <= -48 +4ΔT => 4ΔT >=48 => ΔT >=12\n\nAlso from left: -59+4ΔT <=0, ΔT <=14.75, so ΔT <=14\n\n0 <= -48+4ΔT => ΔT >=12\n\nSo for first car, occupied when ΔT from 12 to 14 inclusive.\n\nΔT=12: -59+48= -11 <=0? -11 <=0 true, -48+48=0 <=0 true? 0 <=0 true.\n\n[ -59+4*12, -48+4*12] = [-59+48, -48+48] = [-11, 0]\n\n0 in [-11,0] yes, since -11<=0<=0.\n\nSimilarly, ΔT=13: [-59+52, -48+52] = [-7,4], 0 in yes.\n\nΔT=14: [-59+56, -48+56] = [-3,8], 0 in yes.\n\nΔT=15: [-59+60, -48+60]= [1,12], 0 not <=1? 0<1, not >=1, so 0 not in [1,12].\n\nSimilarly, ΔT=11: [-59+44, -48+44]=[-15,-4], 0 not in.\n\nSo first car occupies at ΔT=12,13,14.\n\nNow second car: [ -23 +4ΔT, -12 +4ΔT]\n\n0 in if -23+4ΔT <=0 <= -12+4ΔT\n\nLeft: -23+4ΔT <=0 => 4ΔT <=23 => ΔT <=5.75, so ΔT <=5\n\nRight: 0 <= -12+4ΔT => 4ΔT >=12 => ΔT >=3\n\nSo ΔT=3,4,5.\n\nΔT=3: [-23+12, -12+12] = [-11,0], 0 in\n\nΔT=4: [-23+16, -12+16]=[-7,4], 0 in\n\nΔT=5: [-23+20, -12+20]=[-3,8], 0 in\n\nΔT=6: [-23+24, -12+24]=[1,12], 0 not in.\n\nThird car never, as min=13>0.\n\nSo freeway 1 occupied when either car is occupied, so at ΔT=3,4,5 (from second car) or ΔT=12,13,14 (from first car), or both at some points, but since we care if any, so unsafe at ΔT=3,4,5,12,13,14.\n\nΔT=3,4,5 and 12,13,14.\n\nNow freeway 2: same cars as freeway 1? \"2 | (-48, -59, right, 4), (-12, -23, right, 4), (24, 13, right, 4)\" identical to freeway 1.\n\nIn the table:\n\nFreeway 1: (-48,-59,right,4), (-12,-23,right,4), (24,13,right,4)\n\nFreeway 2: same: (-48,-59,right,4), (-12,-23,right,4), (24,13,right,4)\n\nSo same as freeway 1, unsafe at same times: ΔT=3,4,5,12,13,14.\n\nBut freeway 2 is different row, but same car positions and speeds, so yes, same occupation times.\n\nNow freeway 3: cars (48,37,right,6), (12,1,right,6), (-24,-35,right,6)\n\nHead and tail: first car head 48, tail 37? 48>37, so for right-moving, span at T=3: [37,48]?

But at t=4, y=2 unsafe.\n\nFrom y=3, I can only go to y=2,3,4.\n\nAll of which are unsafe at t=4.\n\nBut y=5 is safe at t=4, but I cannot reach y=5 from y=3 in one move; I need to go through y=4 or something.\n\nAt t=3, from y=3, if I go up to y=4, but at t=4, y=4 unsafe.\n\nIf I stay, y=3 unsafe at t=4.\n\nIf down to y=2, unsafe.\n\nSo I must not be on y=2,3,4 at time t=4.\n\nBut at t=3, I am on y=3.\n\nI need to be on a different row at t=4.\n\nBut from y=3, I can only be on y=2,3,4 at t=4.\n\nAll unsafe.\n\nTherefore, I cannot be at y=3 at time t=3, because whatever I do, at t=4 I will be on an unsafe row.\n\nBut at t=3, I am already at y=3, and t=4 is the next time.\n\nI need to avoid being in a position where I am forced into unsafe.\n\nIn this case, at t=3, if I am at y=3, I am stuck; no good action for t=3 action.\n\nTherefore, I should not be at y=3 at time t=3.\n\nBut in my earlier plan, I arrived at y=3 at t=3.\n\nI need to adjust the path.\n\nPerhaps I should delay or something.\n\nStart over.\n\nAt t=0, y=0.\n\nI can stay or go up.\n\nIf I go up to y=1 at t=1.\n\nThen at t=1, y=1, safe.\n\nInstead of going up immediately, I can stay at y=0 for some time.\n\nBut staying at y=0 doesn't help, since I need to go up eventually.\n\nAt t=1, I am at y=1.\n\nI can choose to go up to y=2 or stay or down.\n\nIf I go up to y=2 at t=2.\n\nAt t=2, y=2, safe.\n\nNow, at t=2, I need to choose action for t=3.\n\nIf I go up to y=3, then at t=3, y=3, which is safe (since unsafe only at t=4,5), so at t=3 safe.\n\nBut then at t=3, I am at y=3, safe.\n\nThen for action at t=3, as before, if I go up to y=4, at t=4 on y=4 unsafe.\n\nIf I stay at y=3, at t=4 on y=3 unsafe.\n\nIf I go down to y=2, at t=4 on y=2 unsafe.\n\nAnd y=5 is safe, but I can't reach it directly.\n\nSo problem at t=4.\n\nTo avoid being on y=2,3,4 at t=4, I need to be on a different row at t=4.\n\nBut the only safe rows at t=4 are y=0,5,6,7,8,9? y=1,2,3,4 unsafe at t=4.\n\ny=5 safe at t=4, since unsafe only at t=2.\n\ny=6 always safe.\n\ny=7 unsafe at t=2, but t=4 safe.\n\ny=8 unsafe at t=2, t=4 safe.\n\ny=0 and y=9 safe.\n\nSo at t=4, safe rows are y=0,5,6,7,8,9.\n\nBut I am at y=2 or y=3 at t=3, which are rows 2 or 3, so I can only be at y=1,2,3,4 at t=4 from there, all unsafe except possibly, but y=1,2,3,4 all unsafe at t=4.\n\ny=1 unsafe, y=2 unsafe, y=3 unsafe, y=4 unsafe.\n\nNo way to be safe at t=4 if I am at y=2 or y=3 at t=3.\n\nTherefore, I must not be on y=2 or y=3 at time t=3.\n\nSimilarly, not on y=1 or y=4, but y=4 not reachable yet.\n\nSo at time t=3, I must be on a row not 2 or 3, so y=0,1,4,5,6,7,8,9 but since I am coming from below, probably y=0,1, or I need to be higher.\n\nAt t=3, position.\n\nFrom start: at t=0, y=0.\n\nI need to be at t=3 on a row that is not 2 or 3, or if it is 2 or 3, but since they are safe at t=3, but the issue is the next action.\n\nBut at t=3, if I am on y=1, for example.\n\ny=1 at t=3 is unsafe, because y=1 unsafe at t=3,4,5.\n\nAt t=3, y=1 is unsafe, so I cannot be on y=1 at t=3 anyway.\n\nSimilarly, y=2 at t=3 unsafe.\n\ny=3 at t=3 safe, but leads to problem.\n\ny=4 at t=3: is it possible?\n\nAt t=3, y=4.\n\nBut how to reach y=4 by t=3.\n\nFrom t=0 to t=3, I have 3 actions.\n\nStart y=0 at t=0.\n\nAfter 3 actions, at t=3, y can be from 0 to 3, since each action can increase y by at most 1.\n\nActions from t=0,1,2 to set y at t=3.\n\nAfter action at t=0, y1; t=1, y2; t=2, y3 at time t=3.\n\ny3 can be 0,1,2,3.\n\ny=0,1,2,3.\n\nNow at t=3, y=0: safe, but not progress.\n\ny=1: unsafe at t=3\n\ny=2: unsafe at t=3\n\ny=3: safe at t=3, but as before, leads to unsafe at t=4.\n\nSo if I am at y=3 at t=3, I have problem at t=4.\n\nIf I am at lower, also problem.\n\nBut at t=3, if I am at y=0, for example.\n\nThen at t=3, y=0, safe.\n\nThen I can go up later.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nFirst, to avoid t=4 issue, I need to not be on rows 1-4 at t=4.\n\nAt t=4, rows 1-4 are unsafe.\n\nSo I must be on y=0,5,6,7,8,9 at t=4.\n\nNow, at t=3, I am at some y.\n\nFrom y at t=3, after action, I go to y_{t+1} at t=4.\n\nIf at t=3 I am at y=4, then I can go to y=3,4,5.\n\nBut y=3,4 unsafe at t=4, y=5 safe.\n\nSo if at t=3 I am at y=4, I can go up to y=5 at t=4.\n\ny=5 at t=4 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, if at t=3 I am at y=5, I can go to y=4,5,6; y=4 unsafe, y=5 safe, y=6 safe.\n\nBut to be at y=4 at t=3, how?\n\nAt t=3, y=4.\n\nBut from start, in 3 actions, max y=3, so I cannot be at y=4 at t=3.\n\nSimilarly, y=5 or higher impossible at t=3.\n\nAt t=3, possible y=0,1,2,3.\n\nFrom y=0 at t=3: I can go to y=1 at t=4, but y=1 unsafe at t=4.\n\nOr stay y=0, safe, but not progress.\n\nOr down, same.\n\nFrom y=1 at t=3: but y=1 unsafe at t=3, so already collision at t=3, cannot.\n\nSimilarly, y=2 at t=3 unsafe.\n\ny=3 at t=3 safe, but to go to y=4 or y=2 or stay, all lead to unsafe at t=4 except if I could go to y=5, but cannot from y=3.\n\nSo from y=3 at t=3, I can only go to y=2,3,4 at t=4, all unsafe.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to be safe at t=4 if I am at y=3 at t=3, and I must be at y=0,1,2,3 at t=3, all of which either unsafe at t=3 or lead to unsafe at t=4.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- If at t=3 y=0, safe, but at t=4 can only go to y=0 or y=1, y=1 unsafe.\n\n- If at t=3 y=1, unsafe at t=3.\n\n- If at t=3 y=2, unsafe at t=3.\n\n- If at t=3 y=3, safe at t=3, but at t=4 all options unsafe.\n\nSo in all cases, I cannot avoid collision at t=4 if I start moving up immediately.\n\nTherefore, I need to delay my ascent or something.\n\nPerhaps stay at y=0 for some time.\n\nFor example, at t=0, stay at y=0.\n\nAction S or D, stay at y=0.\n\nThen at t=1, y=0, safe.\n\nThen at t=1, I can go up to y=1 or stay.\n\nIf I go up to y=1 at t=2? At t=1, action: if U, go to y=1 at t=2.\n\nLet's sequence.\n\nAt t=0: action, say S, stay y=0.\n\nThen at t=1, position y=0.\n\nThen at t=1, action: if U, then y=2? No.\n\nAt time t=1, position y=0.\n\nAction a_1: if U, then y_{2} =1.\n\nIf S, y_{2}=0, etc.\n\nSo at t=1, y=0.\n\nI choose action for next position.\n\nIf I choose U, then at t=2, y=1.\n\nIf S, at t=2, y=0.\n\nNow, at t=2, if y=1, is it safe? t=2, ΔT=2, y=1 unsafe only at ΔT=3,4,5,12,13,14, so at t=2 safe.\n\nSimilarly, if at t=2 y=0, safe.\n\nBut I need to avoid the t=4 problem.\n\nAt t=4, I need to not be on rows 1-4.\n\nSo I must be on y=5 or higher or y=0.\n\nBut y=0 is possible but slow.\n\nSince y=6 is always safe, I could be on y=6 at t=4.\n\nBut how to get there.\n\nAt t=4, y=6 is safe.\n\nTo be at y=6 at t=4, I need to have y=6 at time t=4.\n\nFrom start, with 4 actions, I can reach y=4 at most, since each action +1.\n\nActions from t=0 to t=3 to set y at t=4.\n\ny at t=4 is determined by actions at t=0,1,2,3.\n\nEach action can increase y by 1, so after 4 actions, y can be from 0 to 4.\n\nCannot reach y=5 or 6 at t=4.\n\nMax y=4 at t=4.\n\nBut y=4 is unsafe at t=4.\n\nAnd I cannot be on higher rows.\n\nSo at t=4, I must be on y=0 to 4, but y=1,2,3,4 all unsafe at t=4, y=0 safe.\n\nTherefore, the only way to be safe at t=4 is to be on y=0 at t=4.\n\nSimilarly, at t=3, to be able to be at y=0 at t=4, I need to be at y=0 or y=1 at t=3, but y=1 unsafe at t=3, so only if at t=3 I am at y=0, then at t=3 action S or D, stay at y=0 for t=4.\n\nThen at t=4, y=0, safe.\n\nBut at t=3, if I am at y=0, it is safe.\n\nNow, how to be at y=0 at t=3.\n\nFrom start, at t=0, y=0.\n\nIf I do nothing, stay for first few turns.\n\nFor example, at t=0: action S, stay at y=0 for t=1.\n\nAt t=1: position y=0, action S, stay at y=0 for t=2.\n\nAt t=2: position y=0, action S, stay at y=0 for t=3.\n\nAt t=3: position y=0, safe.\n\nThen at t=3, action S, stay at y=0 for t=4.\n\nAt t=4: y=0, safe.\n\nNow, after t=4, the unsafe times for rows 1-4 are t=4 and t=5 for y=3 and 4, but for y=1 and 2 also t=5, and earlier t=3,4,5.\n\nAt t=5, ΔT=5.\n\ny=1 and y=2 unsafe at t=5.\n\ny=3 and y=4 unsafe at t=5.\n\ny=5 safe at t=5, etc.\n\nBut at t=4, I am at y=0.\n\nI can start moving up.\n\nBut I need to go through the rows.\n\nNow, at t=4, y=0, safe.\n\nAction at t=4: I can go U to y=1 at t=5.\n\nBut at t=5, y=1 is unsafe, because ΔT=5, y=1 unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, if I go U, at t=5 on y=1, unsafe.\n\nIf I stay, at t=5 on y=0, safe, but not progress.\n\nSo I cannot go to y=1 at t=5 because it is unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, y=2 at t=5 unsafe.\n\ny=3 at t=5 unsafe.\n\ny=4 at t=5 unsafe.\n\ny=5 safe at t=5.\n\nBut I am at y=0 at t=4, so to reach y=5 at t=5, impossible, since I can only go to y=1.\n\nSo at t=5, I must be on y=0 to 1, both unsafe if y=1, or y=0 safe but stuck.\n\nAt t=5, rows 1-4 unsafe, so only safe are y=0,5,6,7,8,9.\n\nBut from y=0 at t=4, I can only be at y=0 or y=1 at t=5, both not in safe except y=0.\n\ny=0 safe, but then I never move.\n\nI need to wait until after t=5 to move up.\n\nAt t=5, ΔT=5, for y=1 and 2, unsafe until t=5, but at t=6, ΔT=6.\n\ny=1 unsafe at ΔT=3,4,5,12,13,14, so at ΔT=6, safe.\n\nSimilarly y=2 safe at t=6.\n\ny=3 and 4 unsafe at t=4 and 5, so at t=6, ΔT=6, safe.\n\ny=5 safe at t=6, etc.\n\nSo after t=5, all rows are safe except for y=1 and 2 at later times, but t=12 is far.\n\nSo at t=5, I can be on y=0.\n\nThen at t=5, position y=0 (if I stayed).\n\nAction at t=5: U to y=1 at t=6.\n\nAt t=6, y=1, safe since t=6 not unsafe time for y=1.\n\nSimilarly, I can go up.\n\nBut I wasted time staying at y=0.\n\nNow, let's plan the sequence to minimize H.\n\nFirst, I need to reach y=9.\n\nThe earliest I can be at y=9 is with all U actions, but with delays due to unsafe times.\n\nSince I have to avoid being on rows 1-4 at t=4 and t=5, essentially.\n\nt=4 and t=5 are bad for rows 1-4.\n\nSpecifically, at t=4 and t=5, rows 1,2,3,4 are all unsafe.\n\nSo I must not be on those rows at those times.\n\nAlso, at t=3, rows 1 and 2 are unsafe, so I cannot be on them at t=3.\n\nAt t=2, rows 5,7,8 are unsafe, but I may not be there.\n\nTo go up, I need to pass the lower rows before or after the bad times.\n\nThe bad times are t=2 for rows 5,7,8, but row 5 unsafe only at t=2, similarly 7 and 8.\n\nAnd for rows 1-4, unsafe at t=3,4,5 for y=1,2; t=4,5 for y=3,4.\n\ny=1 and 2 unsafe at t=3,4,5; y=3 and 4 unsafe at t=4,5.\n\nSo rows 1-4 are bad from t=3 to t=5.\n\nI should be above or below during that time.\n\nBelow means y=0, above means y=5 or higher.\n\nBut at t=3, I can be at y=0 or y=3 or higher, but y=3 is possible but then stuck.\n\nSince I start from y=0, it's easier to stay low until after t=5.\n\nThen after t=5, all clear to go up.\n\nSo let's do that.\n\nStay at y=0 from t=0 to t=5.\n\nAt t=0: action S, stay at y=0 for t=1\n\nAt t=1: action S, stay at y=0 for t=2\n\nAt t=2: action S, stay at y=0 for t=3\n\nAt t=3: action S, stay at y=0 for t=4\n\nAt t=4: action S, stay at y=0 for t=5\n\nAt t=5: action S, stay at y=0 for t=6\n\nNow at t=6, position y=0, safe.\n\nThen I can start moving up.\n\nAt t=6: action U, to y=1 at t=7\n\nAt t=7, position y=1. ΔT=7, T=10? t= ΔT, T=3+t, so at t=6, T=9, ΔT=6.\n\ny=1 at ΔT=6, not in unsafe times, safe.\n\nSimilarly, at t=7: action U, to y=2 at t=8\n\nAt t=8, y=2, ΔT=8, safe.\n\nAt t=8: action U, to y=3 at t=9\n\nAt t=9, y=3, ΔT=9, not unsafe (unsafe at 4,5), safe.\n\nAt t=9: action U, to y=4 at t=10\n\nAt t=10, y=4, ΔT=10, not unsafe, safe.\n\nAt t=10: action U, to y=5 at t=11\n\nAt t=11, y=5, ΔT=11, unsafe only at t=2, so safe.\n\nAt t=11: action U, to y=6 at t=12\n\nAt t=12, y=6, always safe.\n\nAt t=12: action U, to y=7 at t=13\n\nAt t=13, y=7, ΔT=13, unsafe only at t=2, so safe.\n\nAt t=13: action U, to y=8 at t=14\n\nAt t=14, y=8, ΔT=14, unsafe only at t=2, so safe.\n\nAt t=14: action U, to y=9 at t=15\n\nAt t=15, y=9, reached.\n\nNow, H is the number of actions from t=0 to t=14, that's 15 actions? Let's index.\n\nActions at t=0 to t=14, 15 actions, and at t=15, y=9.\n\nt from 0 to 14 inclusive, that's 15 steps.\n\nBut min might be less.\n\nIn this sequence, I stayed from t=0 to t=5, that's 6 turns at y=0, then 9 moves up to y=9, total 15 actions to reach at t=15.\n\nBut perhaps I can start moving earlier or later to reduce.\n\nSince y=6 is always safe, I could go faster to y=6.\n\nBut to reach y=6, I need to pass through lower rows.\n\nThe lower rows have restrictions around t=3-5.\n\nFor example, if I can be on y=5 at t=4 or something, but earlier we saw at t=4, y=5 is safe, but I can't reach it from below.\n\nAt t=3, max y=3.\n\nAt t=4, max y=4.\n\ny=4 unsafe at t=4.\n\nBut if I could be at y=5 at t=4, safe, but impossible.\n\nPerhaps I can go down from higher, but I start low.\n\nAnother idea: at t=2, I can be on y=2, which is safe at t=2.\n\nThen from there, instead of going up to y=3 at t=3, I can stay or go down.\n\nBut at t=3, y=2 unsafe, so I cannot be on y=2 at t=3.\n\nSimilarly, y=1 unsafe.\n\nSo at t=3, I must be at y=0 or y=3.\n\ny=3 safe at t=3.\n\nThen at t=3, if I am at y=3, I can go down to y=2, but at t=4 y=2 unsafe.\n\nNot good.\n\nOr stay, at t=4 y=3 unsafe.\n\nOr up, y=4 unsafe.\n\nAll bad.\n\nSo only option is to be at y=0 at t=3 and t=4.\n\nThen at t=4, after t=4, I can go up, but at t=5, y=1 to 4 unsafe, so I cannot go up until t=6.\n\nSo I think the sequence above is necessary, with waiting at y=0 until t=5.\n\nBut at t=5, I can be at y=0 and go up at t=6.\n\nIn the sequence, I stayed until t=5, then at t=5 I am at y=0, and I can go to y=1 at t=6, as above.\n\nBut at t=5, if I am at y=0, I could go to y=1 at t=6, but at t=6 y=1 is safe.\n\nYes.\n\nTo save one turn, perhaps I can be at higher row at t=6.\n\nFor example, if at some point I move faster.\n\nBut from t=0 to t=5, I am at y=0.\n\nAt t=5, action U to y=1 at t=6.\n\nThen as before.\n\nI could have moved up before t=3, but then I hit the unsafe at t=3 or t=4.\n\nFor example, suppose at t=0, U to y=1 at t=1.\n\nAt t=1, y=1 safe (t=1).\n\nThen at t=1, instead of U, I stay at y=1 or go down.\n\nIf at t=1, action S, stay at y=1 for t=2.\n\nAt t=2, y=1, safe (t=2).\n\nThen at t=2, action: if I go down to y=0, then at t=3, y=0, safe.\n\nThen at t=3, I can stay or go up, but at t=4, if go to y=1, unsafe, or stay y=0.\n\nSimilarly, if at t=2 I stay at y=1, then at t=3, y=1 unsafe.\n\nNot good.\n\nAt t=2, from y=1, I go down to y=0 at t=3.\n\nAt t=3, y=0 safe.\n\nThen same as before, I need to stay at y=0 for t=4 and t=5? At t=4, if I stay y=0, safe, but at t=5, I am at y=0, and I cannot go to y=1 because y=1 unsafe at t=5.\n\nSo I have to wait until t=5 to go to y=1 at t=6, but at t=5, if I am at y=0, action at t=5: if I U, to y=1 at t=6, or S to y=0 at t=6.\n\nAt t=6, y=1 or 0.\n\nBut to go up, at t=5 action U to y=1 at t=6.\n\nThen proceed.\n\nBut I spent time at y=1 unnecessarily.\n\nIn terms of total turns, from start to reach y=9.\n\nIn the first sequence, I reached at t=15 with y=9.\n\nWith 15 actions.\n\nBut perhaps I can reach earlier.\n\nFor example, if I can be at y=3 at t=2 or something.\n\nAt t=0: U to y=1 at t=1\n\nAt t=1: U to y=2 at t=2\n\nAt t=2, y=2 safe.\n\nNow at t=2, if I could go directly to y=3, but I can only change by 1, so to y=1,2,3.\n\nIf I go U to y=3 at t=3.\n\nThen at t=3, y=3 safe, but then at t=4, problem.\n\nIf at t=2, I go down to y=1, but at t=3 y=1 unsafe.\n\nWorse.\n\nOr stay at y=2 at t=3, but y=2 unsafe at t=3.\n\nNot possible.\n\nSo I think I must avoid being on rows 1-4 from t=3 to t=5 inclusive.\n\nTherefore, I should be at y=0 during t=3,4,5.\n\nAt t=2, I can be at y=0,1,2.\n\nIf at t=2 I am at y=2, I need to go down to y=1 or y=0 for t=3.\n\nBut y=1 at t=3 unsafe, so I must go to y=0 at t=3.\n\nSimilarly, if at t=2 y=1, I can go to y=0 at t=3.\n\nOr if at t=2 y=0, stay.\n\nThen at t=3, y=0.\n\nThen stay at t=4, y=0.\n\nAt t=5, y=0.\n\nThen at t=5 action to go to y=1 at t=6.\n\nNow, at t=2, if I am at y=2, I have to go down to y=0 at t=3, which takes an extra down move, but I was higher, so net, to reach y=0 at t=3, I can be at y=0 at t=3 directly by staying, or by going up and down, which takes more actions but same position later.\n\nFor example, if I go to y=2 at t=2, then down to y=1 at t=3? But y=1 unsafe at t=3, collision.\n\nCannot.\n\nIf at t=2, from y=2, go down to y=1 at t=3, but at t=3 y=1 unsafe, collision.\n\nGo directly to y=0 from y=2? No, I can only go to y=1 or stay or down to y=1, same.\n\nFrom y=2, actions: U to y=3, S to y=2, D to y=1.\n\nCannot go directly to y=0.\n\nSo from y=2 at t=2, to be safe at t=3, I must go to y=3, but y=3 safe at t=3, but then problem at t=4.\n\nOr go to y=1 or y=2, both unsafe at t=3.\n\nTherefore, from y=2 at t=2, there is no safe action for t=3 that avoids collision at t=3 or later at t=4.\n\nSpecifically, if I go to y=3 at t=3, safe at t=3 but unsafe at t=4 inevitably.\n\nIf I go to y=1 or y=2 at t=3, unsafe at t=3.\n\nSo I cannot be at y=2 at t=2.\n\nSimilarly, if I am at y=1 at t=2, same issue at t=3.\n\nTherefore, the only safe way is to be at y=0 at t=2, t=3, t=4, t=5, and then start moving up at t=5 to y=1 at t=6, etc.\n\nThus, the minimal H is achieved by staying at y=0 until t=5, then moving up directly to y=9.\n\nIn this case, actions:\n\nAt t=0 (T=3): action S (or D, same), stay y=0\n\nAt t=1 (T=4): action S, stay y=0\n\nAt t=2 (T=5): action S, stay y=0\n\nAt t=3 (T=6): action S, stay y=0? t=3 is T=6? t=ΔT, T=3+t.\n\nt=0, T=3\n\nt=1, T=4\n\nt=2, T=5\n\nt=3, T=6\n\nAt t=3 (T=6), position y=0 (since stayed)\n\nAction: S, stay for t=4\n\nAt t=4 (T=7), y=0\n\nAction S, stay for t=5\n\nAt t=5 (T=8), y=0\n\nAction S, stay for t=6? No, at t=5, I need to go up.\n\nAt t=5, position y=0.\n\nAction: U, to y=1 at t=6\n\nAt t=6 (T=9), position y=1\n\nAction U, to y=2 at t=7\n\nAt t=7 (T=10), y=2\n\nAction U, to y=3 at t=8\n\nAt t=8 (T=11), y=3\n\nAction U, to y=4 at t=9\n\nAt t=9 (T=12), y=4\n\nAction U, to y=5 at t=10\n\nAt t=10 (T=13), y=5\n\nAction U, to y=6 at t=11\n\nAt t=11 (T=14), y=6\n\nAction U, to y=7 at t=12\n\nAt t=12 (T=15), y=7\n\nAction U, to y=8 at t=13\n\nAt t=13 (T=16), y=8\n\nAction U, to y=9 at t=14\n\nAt t=14 (T=17), y=9.\n\nReached at t=14 with y=9.\n\nNumber of actions: from t=0 to t=13, actions at t=0 to t=13, that's 14 actions.\n\nt from 0 to 13 inclusive: 14 actions.\n\nAfter 14 actions, at time t=14, y=9.\n\nIn the sequence, actions at t=0 to t=13.\n\nt=0: S\n\nt=1: S\n\nt=2: S\n\nt=3: S\n\nt=4: S\n\nt=5: U  // to y=1 at t=6\n\nt=6: U  // to y=2 at t=7\n\nt=7: U  // to y=3 at t=8\n\nt=8: U  // to y=4 at t=9\n\nt=9: U  // to y=5 at t=10\n\nt=10: U // to y=6 at t=11\n\nt=11: U // to y=7 at t=12\n\nt=12: U // to y=8 at t=13\n\nt=13: U // to y=9 at t=14\n\nSo actions from t=0 to t=13, 14 actions.\n\nH=14.\n\nBut earlier I thought min is 9, but with obstacles, 14.\n\nBut is there a faster way?\n\nSuppose I go to y=1 at t=1.\n\nBut then I have to leave before t=3.\n\nAt t=1, y=1.\n\nI can go to y=2 at t=2.\n\nAt t=2, y=2 safe.\n\nBut at t=2, I cannot stay or go down because at t=3, y=2 unsafe, or if go to y=1, unsafe.\n\nIf I go to y=3 at t=3, safe at t=3 but then at t=4 on y=3 or y=4, both unsafe.\n\nNo.\n\nAt t=2, from y=2, I go down to y=1 at t=3, but unsafe.\n\nNot possible.\n\nPerhaps I can reach y=6 faster.\n\ny=6 always safe, so if I can be at y=6 at earlier time.\n\nBut to reach y=6, I need to go through y=1 to 5, which have restrictions.\n\nFor example, with all U, I can be at y=6 at t=6: start t=0 y=0, U to y1 t=1, U to y2 t=2, U to y3 t=3, U to y4 t=4, U to y5 t=5, U to y6 t=6.\n\nBut at t=3, y=3: but t=3 ΔT=0? t=ΔT, at t=3, ΔT=3, y=3 unsafe? No, y=3 unsafe only at t=4 and t=5.\n\nAt t=3, y=3 safe.\n\nBut at t=4, y=4 unsafe, so when I go to y=4 at t=4, unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, at t=5, if I go to y=5, y=5 safe at t=5? y=5 unsafe only at t=2, so at t=5 safe.\n\nBut at t=4, y=4 unsafe, so I collide at t=4.\n\nCannot.\n\nIf I stay at some point.\n\nFor example, at t=0: U to y1 t=1\n\nt=1: U to y2 t=2\n\nt=2: now at y2, instead of U, I stay at y2 for t=3? But at t=3 y2 unsafe, collision.\n\nGo down to y1 at t=3, unsafe.\n\nNot possible.\n\nSo I think the only way is to stay at y=0 during the critical period.\n\nThus minimal H is 14.\n\nBut let's confirm the answer.\n\nIn the sequence, I have 5 stays at y=0 from t=0 to t=4? Let's list actions:\n\nActions:\n\nTurn t1 + 0: S (action at T=3)\n\nIn the answer, it should be actions starting from turn t1=3.\n\nAnd sequence.\n\nIn terms of the turn.\n\nCurrent turn t1=3.\n\nAt turn T=3, position (0,0), take action a_{3}.\n\nThen after action, position for T=4.\n\nBut collision at turn T based on position at start of turn.\n\nIn the sequence above, with t=ΔT.\n\nAt turn T=3 (t=0), position y=0, take action S, so for T=4, position y=0.\n\nAt turn T=4 (t=1), position y=0, take action S, for T=5, y=0.\n\n...\n\nUp to turn T=8 (t=5), position y=0, take action U, for T=9, y=1.\n\nTurn T=9 (t=6), position y=1, take action U, for T=10, y=2.\n\n...\n\nTurn T=16 (t=13), position y=8, take action U, for T=17, y=9.\n\nAt T=17, y=9, reached.\n\nNumber of actions: from T=3 to T=16 inclusive, that's 14 actions: T=3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16.\n\n14 actions, H=14.\n\nT=3 to T=16 is 14 turns: 3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16 → 14 actions.\n\nAfter that, at T=17, y=9.\n\nNow, for the answer format.\n\nBut in the sequence, from T=3 to T=8, I stay at y=0, that's actions at T=3 to T=8: S each.\n\nT=3 to T=8: actions for position at T+1, but in terms of action at turn.\n\nAt turn T, I take action a_T, which determines y_{T+1}.\n\nBut position at turn T is given before action.\n\nIn collision, at turn T, position y_T, then action a_T, then y_{T+1} for next turn.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\n- Turn 3: position y=0, take action S → y_4 =0\n\n- Turn 4: position y=0, take action S → y_5=0\n\n- Turn 5: position y=0, take action S → y_6=0\n\n- Turn 6: position y=0, take action S → y_7=0\n\n- Turn 7: position y=0, take action S → y_8=0\n\n- Turn 8: position y=0, take action U → y_9=1\n\n- Turn 9: position y=1, take action U → y_10=2\n\n- Turn 10: position y=2, take action U → y_11=3\n\n- Turn 11: position y=3, take action U → y_12=4\n\n- Turn 12: position y=4, take action U → y_13=5\n\n- Turn 13: position y=5, take action U → y_14=6\n\n- Turn 14: position y=6, take action U → y_15=7\n\n- Turn 15: position y=7, take action U → y_16=8\n\n- Turn 16: position y=8, take action U → y_17=9\n\nAt turn 17, position y=9.\n\nActions from turn 3 to 16, 14 actions.\n\nNow, for the cars, we have later unsafe times, like for y=1 at t=12,13,14 which is ΔT=12,13,14, T=15,16,17.\n\nBut at T=15, if I am on y=7, not y=1, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nIn this sequence, I reach at T=17.\n\nBut is there a way with fewer actions?\n\nSuppose I go to y=1 at t=1 (T=4), but then I have to leave before t=3.\n\nBut at t=1, I can only be at y=1.\n\nThen at t=1, if I stay, at t=2 y=1 safe, but at t=3 unsafe.\n\nIf at t=1, I go down to y=0 at t=2.\n\nThen at t=2, y=0 safe.\n\nThen I need to stay for t=3,4,5.\n\nSame as before, but I wasted one move to y=1 and back, so worse.\n\nFor example: T=3: U → y4=1\n\nT=4: position y=1, take D → y5=0? Or S, but D to go down.\n\nAction D: Δy = -1, so y_{T+1} = y_T -1.\n\nAt T=4, y=1, D → y5=0\n\nThen at T=5, position y=0, take S → y6=0\n\nT=6: y=0, S → y7=0\n\nT=7: y=0, S → y8=0\n\nT=8: y=0, U → y9=1\n\netc, same as before but I have extra actions at T=3 and T=4, so more turns to reach.\n\nWorse.\n\nThus, minimal is to stay from beginning.\n\nAnother idea: since y=6 is safe, I could go down from higher, but I start at 0, not possible.\n\nOr at t=2, I can be on y=0,1,2.\n\nBut y=1 and y=2 lead to problems, so best to be at y=0.\n\nThus, H=14 is minimal.\n\nBut let's confirm if I can reach by t=14 or something.\n\nSuppose I stay at y=0 until t=4.\n\nAt t=0: S, y=0 t=1\n\nt=1: S, y=0 t=2\n\nt=2: S, y=0 t=3\n\nt=3: S, y=0 t=4\n\nAt t=4, y=0, safe.\n\nNow at t=4, action: I want to go up, but at t=5, if I go to y=1, unsafe.\n\nSo I must stay at y=0 for t=5.\n\nAt t=4: S, to y=0 at t=5\n\nThen at t=5: U, to y=1 at t=6\n\nSame as before.\n\nIf at t=4 I go to y=1, but at t=5 on y=1 unsafe.\n\nCannot.\n\nSo no.\n\nPerhaps I can be on y=5 at t=2, but impossible.\n\nThus, I think H=14 is the minimal.\n\nNow for the answer.\n\nThe sequence of actions:\n\nTurn 3: S\n\nTurn 4: S\n\nTurn 5: S\n\nTurn 6: S\n\nTurn 7: S\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nIn terms of the turn:\n\nActions at turn: 3,4,5,6,7: S\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nThat's turn 3 to 16, 14 actions.\n\nTurn 3 S, turn 4 S, ..., turn 7 S (that's 5 S: T3,4,5,6,7)\n\nThen turn 8 U to y=1 at T9? Let's list:\n\nAfter action at turn T, y_{T+1} set.\n\nStart: turn 3, position y=0\n\nAction a3=S → y4=0\n\nTurn 4, position y=0, a4=S → y5=0\n\nTurn 5, y=0, a5=S → y6=0\n\nTurn 6, y=0, a6=S → y7=0\n\nTurn 7, y=0, a7=S → y8=0\n\nTurn 8, y=0, a8=U → y9=1\n\nTurn 9, y=1, a9=U → y10=2\n\nTurn 10, y=2, a10=U → y11=3\n\nTurn 11, y=3, a11=U → y12=4\n\nTurn 12, y=4, a12=U → y13=5\n\nTurn 13, y=5, a13=U → y14=6\n\nTurn 14, y=6, a14=U → y15=7\n\nTurn 15, y=7, a15=U → y16=8\n\nTurn 16, y=8, a16=U → y17=9\n\nSo actions from turn 3 to 16.\n\nIn the sequence, turn 7: action S, but after that y8=0, then turn 8 U to y9=1.\n\nIn the answer, it should be listed as:\n\nTurn t1: a_{t1} etc.\n\nt1=3.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 3: S\n\nTurn 4: S\n\nTurn 5: S\n\nTurn 6: S\n\nTurn 7: S\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nThat's 14 actions.\n\nBut in the turn, from 3 to 16, 14 turns.\n\nH=14.\n\nNow, to write in box.\n\nBut in the sequence, at turn 12, y=4, which at T=12, ΔT=9, not unsafe, safe.\n\nSimilarly all.\n\nAnd I reach at T=17.\n\nPerhaps I can go faster after t=6.\n\nFor example, from t=6, y=0, I go U to y1 at t=7, but I need to go step by step.\n\nSince y=6 safe, but I have to go through.\n\nNo shortcut.\n\nThus, this should be minimal.\n\nSo the sequence.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 3\\) is 14. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by staying at \\(y = 0\\) during the unsafe periods (turns 4 to 8, corresponding to \\(\\Delta T = 1\\) to \\(\\Delta T = 5\\)) and then moving directly upward to \\(y = 9\\) starting from turn 9.\n\nThe actions are as follows:\n\n- **Turn 3 (current turn):** Action \\(S\\) (stay), resulting in position \\((0, 0)\\) for turn 4.\n- **Turn 4:** Action \\(S\\), resulting in position \\((0, 0)\\) for turn 5.\n- **Turn 5:** Action \\(S\\), resulting in position \\((0, 0)\\) for turn 6.\n- **Turn 6:** Action \\(S\\), resulting in position \\((0, 0)\\) for turn 7.\n- **Turn 7:** Action \\(S\\), resulting in position \\((0, 0)\\) for turn 8.\n- **Turn 8:** Action \\(U\\) (up), resulting in position \\((0, 1)\\) for turn 9.\n- **Turn 9:** Action \\(U\\), resulting in position \\((0, 2)\\) for turn 10.\n- **Turn 10:** Action \\(U\\), resulting in position \\((0, 3)\\) for turn 11.\n- **Turn 11:** Action \\(U\\), resulting in position \\((0, 4)\\) for turn 12.\n- **Turn 12:** Action \\(U\\), resulting in position \\((0, 5)\\) for turn 13.\n- **Turn 13:** Action \\(U\\), resulting in position \\((0, 6)\\) for turn 14.\n- **Turn 14:** Action \\(U\\), resulting in position \\((0, 7)\\) for turn 15.\n- **Turn 15:** Action \\(U\\), resulting in position \\((0, 8)\\) for turn 16.\n- **Turn 16:** Action \\(U\\), resulting in position \\((0, 9)\\) for turn 17.\n\nAt turn 17, the position \\((0, 9)\\) is reached. The sequence ensures that the player is never on a freeway row (\\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\)) when it is occupied by a car at the corresponding turn. Specifically:\n- Rows \\(y = 1\\) and \\(y = 2\\) are unsafe at turns 6, 7, 8 (due to \\(\\Delta T = 3, 4, 5\\)) and later turns (12, 13, 14), but the player avoids these by being at \\(y = 0\\) or moving through after the unsafe periods.\n- Rows \\(y = 3\\) and \\(y = 4\\) are unsafe at turns 7 and 8 (due to \\(\\Delta T = 4, 5\\)), avoided similarly.\n- Row \\(y = 5\\) is unsafe only at turn 5 (due to \\(\\Delta T = 2\\)), avoided by being at \\(y = 0\\).\n- Rows \\(y = 7\\) and \\(y = 8\\) are unsafe only at turn 5 (due to \\(\\Delta T = 2\\)), avoided by being at \\(y = 0\\).\n- Row \\(y = 6\\) is always safe, and the player passes through at turn 14 without issue.\n\nThis sequence achieves the goal in the minimal number of turns (14 actions) while avoiding all collisions.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 3: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 4: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 5: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 14: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 15: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 16: U \\\\ \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>We are given the current turn t1 = 6, and the player is at (0,0). The goal is to reach (0,9) in minimal turns H, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways 1 to 8.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S). The movement is only in the y-direction (vertical). The grid has y from 0 to 9.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if the player is on a freeway k (which corresponds to y=k) and at that turn, the car on that freeway has a span that includes 0 (the x-coordinate of the player is always 0).\n\nImportant note: when moving from freeway y to freeway y' at turn T, at turn T the player is still on freeway y. Only at the next turn (T+1) will the player be on freeway y'. So if at turn T we move to a new freeway, we are not on that new freeway until the next turn.\n\nWe are given the state of the cars at turn t1=6. For each freeway (1 to 8) we have a list of cars. Each car is defined by (head, tail, direction, speed). Note that for left-moving cars, the head is at the left (so head < tail?) but in the problem description, for left-moving the span is [h, tau] and then it moves to [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]. Similarly, for right-moving, the span is [tau, h] and moves to [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n\nHowever, looking at the data, all cars in this instance are right-moving. For a right-moving car, the head is the rightmost point? Actually, in the problem description for right-moving: \n  Initially: [tau, h] (so tau is the left end, h is the right end? because then when moving right, the span becomes [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]).\n\nBut in the given data, we have for freeway 1: \n  (-48, -59, right, 4): note that -48 > -59, so if we interpret the first number as h and the second as tau, then h=-48, tau=-59, so the initial span at t1=6 is [tau, h] = [-59, -48] (since -59 < -48). Then at a later turn T, the car will be at [-59 + 4*(T-6), -48 + 4*(T-6)].\n\nSimilarly, the other cars: \n  (-12, -23, right, 4) -> span [-23, -12] at t1=6\n  (24, 13, right, 4) -> but 24>13, so this would be [13,24] at t1=6? However, note the problem says: for right-moving, the span is given as (head h, tail tau) and then the initial span is [tau, h]? But wait, the problem states: \n      \"Right-moving: [Span(t1) = [tau, h]\"\n  So in the data, the car is represented as (h, tau, direction, speed). Therefore, for (24,13,right,4): \n      head h = 24, tail tau = 13 -> so the initial span is [tau, h] = [13,24].\n\nBut wait, the problem says: \"For car k on freeway i, suppose its head is at h, tail is at tau\". For a right-moving car, the head is the front (rightmost) and the tail is the rear (leftmost). So the span is [tail, head] = [tau, h]. \n\nSo for the car (24,13,right,4): at t1=6, the car is at [13,24]. Then at time T, it will be at [13+4*(T-6), 24+4*(T-6)].\n\nSimilarly, the car (-48,-59,right,4): head=-48, tail=-59 -> so the car is at [-59,-48] at t1=6.\n\nNow, collision occurs at turn T if the player is on freeway k at turn T and the car on that freeway has a span that includes 0 at that exact turn.\n\nWe note that the player starts at y=0 (which is not a freeway with cars) at turn t1=6. We need to get to y=9 (which is also not a freeway) but we must traverse freeways 1 to 8.\n\nWe are to output a sequence of actions starting at turn t1 (which is 6) for H turns until we reach y=9.\n\nSince the goal is to minimize H, we want to get to y=9 as quickly as possible. The minimal vertical distance is 9 (from 0 to 9). Without any obstacles, we would just go up 9 times (H=9). But we have to avoid the cars on the freeways.\n\nWe must check for each freeway we step on (at the exact turn we are on that freeway) that the car(s) on that freeway do not have 0 in their span at that turn.\n\nWe can also choose to stay (S) or even move down (D) if necessary to avoid a collision.\n\nWe are going to simulate the player's moves and the car movements over time.\n\nLet t = 0 relative to t1? Actually, we start at turn t1=6. Then the next turn is 7, then 8, etc. So we can let time T (absolute) = 6,7,8,... and we start at T=6 at y=0.\n\nWe are going to consider the state at each turn T (starting at T=6) and decide the next action.\n\nWe note that the car positions at time T (absolute) for a car that was at (h, tau, d, s) at t1=6 are:\n\nFor a right-moving car: \n   left_end(T) = tau + s*(T-6)\n   right_end(T) = h + s*(T-6)\n\nCollision on freeway k at time T if: \n   the player is at freeway k (i.e., y_T = k) and there exists a car on freeway k such that:\n        left_end(T) <= 0 <= right_end(T)\n\nWe must avoid that.\n\nWe start at T=6, y=0. Then we choose an action a_6 (at turn 6) which can be U, D, or S. Since we are at y=0, D would take us to y=-1? but the grid constrains y in [0,9]. So if we choose D at y=0, we remain at 0? Similarly, if we choose U, we go to y=1.\n\nBut note: at T=6, we are at y=0. We are not on any freeway (freeways are 1-8). So no collision at T=6.\n\nThen at T=7, we will be at y_7 = y_6 + Δy_6. If we choose U at T=6, then at T=7 we are at y=1 (freeway 1). Then we must check the cars on freeway 1 at T=7.\n\nSimilarly, if we choose S at T=6, then at T=7 we are still at y=0 (not a freeway) and then we choose an action at T=7.\n\nOur goal is to be at y=9 at some turn T. Note that we must be at y=9 at the moment we are there? Actually, the problem says \"reach (0,9)\". And note that y=9 is not a freeway (since freeways are 1-8). So we don't check collisions at y=9.\n\nBut we must be at y=9 at the last turn of our sequence.\n\nWe are to output the actions from turn t1 (6) to turn t1+H-1, and H is the number of turns in the sequence.\n\nWe are going to do a BFS (breadth-first search) over states (time T, y) to find the minimal H. However, note that time T is absolute and increases without bound, but the cars are moving linearly and we are constrained to y in [0,9]. Also, the car positions are linear in time, so we can compute the positions at any T.\n\nBut note: the minimal H is at least 9 (if we go up every time) and we might have to wait sometimes. So we can set a bound, say H_min=9 and then if we can't find a path in 9, then try 10, etc.\n\nHowever, we must note that we can also move down to avoid a collision and then move up again, which might take more turns.\n\nWe are going to simulate the path. We can use dynamic programming or BFS. The state can be (T, y) where T is the absolute turn (starting at 6) and y is the current y-coordinate.\n\nBut note: the state (T,y) is sufficient because the car positions at time T are determined by T and the initial state (which is fixed).\n\nWe want to minimize the number of turns (H) which is T - 6 (since we start at T=6 and we count the turns from T=6 to T=6+H-1). Actually, after H actions (from turn 6 to turn 6+H-1) we are at y_{6+H} = 9? \n\nWait: \n  At turn 6 (T=6): we are at y_6 = 0. Then we take an action a_6 which determines y_7.\n  ...\n  At turn 6+H-1 (T=6+H-1): we take an action that leads to y_{6+H}.\n\nWe want y_{6+H} = 9.\n\nSo the number of actions is H, and the time at the last action is T = 6+H-1, and then at the next state (without action) we are at y=9? Actually, we are at y=9 at time T+1? But the problem says we must be at (0,9) at the turn when we have taken the last action? \n\nReading: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" such that after taking H actions (from t1 to t1+H-1) we are at y=9 at turn t1+H-1? \n\nBut note: the update is: at turn t, we take action a_t, then we update to y_{t+1}. So at the turn when we take the last action (at turn t1+H-1) we are at position y_{t1+H-1} and then after the action we become y_{t1+H}. We require y_{t1+H} = 9.\n\nSo we require that at the state after the last action we are at y=9. Therefore, the last action must lead to y=9.\n\nWe can represent the state at the beginning of a turn: at turn T (absolute), we are at y. Then we choose an action a, and then we move to (T+1, y') where y' = min(9, max(0, y + delta)).\n\nBut note: we start at T=6, y=0. Then we choose a_6 and then at T=7 we are at y_7.\n\nWe want to have at some T, after an action, we are at y=9. So the state we are in at the beginning of turn T is (T, y), and we are going to take an action that leads to y_{T+1} = 9? Then we stop at that action.\n\nAlternatively, we can consider that we are at (T, y) and we want to get to y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nWe'll do a BFS (by time T) and we keep the minimal number of actions (which is T-6) to reach (T, y) and then we check if we can get to y=9.\n\nWe start with state (6,0) with 0 actions so far.\n\nThen we consider the next action: U, D, S.\n\nThe next state will be (7, y') where y' = min(9, max(0, 0+1)) = 1 for U, 0 for S or D (because D would be 0-1=-1 -> clamped to 0).\n\nThen we check for collision: at state (7,1): we are on freeway 1 at time T=7? Actually, at time T=7, we are at y=1 (freeway 1) and we must check the cars on freeway 1 at time T=7.\n\nSimilarly, if we choose S at T=6, we stay at y=0 at T=7 -> no collision because y=0 is not a freeway.\n\nBut note: we are not required to avoid collisions at non-freeway rows? Only freeways 1-8.\n\nSo for state (T,y), if y is in {1,2,...,8} then we must check that no car on freeway y has a span that includes 0 at time T.\n\nOtherwise, no collision.\n\nWe then mark the state (T,y) as visited and then expand.\n\nWe stop when we reach a state where we can take an action that leads to y=9. Specifically, if at state (T,y) we choose an action that makes y_{T+1}=9, then we are done. But note: we don't actually step on freeway 9? Because freeways are 1-8. So when we are at y=8 and we go up, then at the next state we are at y=9 and we are done. And at the moment we are at y=8 (freeway 8) at time T, we take the action U and then at time T+1 we are at y=9 and the game ends. We don't check collision at y=9.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"avoid collisions with cars on freeways y=1,...,8\". So only when we are at freeways 1-8 we check.\n\nTherefore, when we are at y=8 at time T, we must check that we are not colliding with a car on freeway 8 at time T (because that's when we are on freeway 8). Then we take the action U to go to y=9 at time T+1.\n\nSimilarly, if we are at y=9 at time T, that would be the end, but we never actually are at y=9 at the beginning of a turn? Because we end when we first reach y=9.\n\nSo our goal is: from a state (T, y) we choose an action a such that the next y = y + delta = 9. Then we stop and output the sequence.\n\nWe are going to do BFS (by time T) to find the minimal H. Since the minimal H is at least 9, and we might have to wait, we can set a limit on T, say up to 6+20 (20 steps) to be safe.\n\nWe also note that the cars move at constant speeds and their positions are linear. We must compute for each freeway and each car the time intervals during which they cover 0.\n\nBut we can compute at a given T for a given freeway k: if there is any car on k that has:\n   left_end(T) <= 0 <= right_end(T)\n\nIf yes, then freeway k is blocked at time T.\n\nWe are going to precompute for each freeway k and for each car the time interval [t_start, t_end] for which 0 is in the car's span? Actually, the car's span at time T is [left(T), right(T)]. We can compute when 0 is in that interval.\n\nBut note: there are multiple cars per freeway. We can compute for each freeway k the set of time T (if any) when at least one car on k has 0 in its span.\n\nAlternatively, we can compute for each freeway k the union of the intervals where it is blocked.\n\nBut note: the cars are moving at constant speeds and the spans are contiguous. So for a given car, the condition is:\n   left_end(T) <= 0 <= right_end(T)\n\nFor a right-moving car with initial (at T0=6): left_end0 = tau, right_end0 = h.\nThen at time T: left_end(T) = tau + s*(T-6)\n             right_end(T) = h + s*(T-6)\n\nSo we have:\n   tau + s*(T-6) <= 0 <= h + s*(T-6)\n\nSolving for T:\n\n   T >= ( -tau ) / s + 6   [if s>0, note tau is negative?]\n   T <= ( -h ) / s + 6? \n\nActually:\n\n   tau + s*(T-6) <= 0  => T <= ( -tau ) / s + 6? \n   But note: if tau is negative, then -tau is positive.\n\nLet me rearrange:\n\n   tau + s*(T-6) <= 0  => s*(T-6) <= -tau  => T-6 <= -tau/s   => T <= 6 - tau/s.\n\nSimilarly, 0 <= h + s*(T-6)  => s*(T-6) >= -h  => T-6 >= -h/s   => T >= 6 - h/s.\n\nBut note: since h and tau are given at time 6, and for a right-moving car we have h>tau (because the head is to the right). \n\nBut in our data, for the car (-48,-59,right,4) at time 6: \n   tau = -59, h = -48.\n   Then T must satisfy:\n        T >= 6 - h/s = 6 - (-48)/4 = 6 + 12 = 18\n        T <= 6 - tau/s = 6 - (-59)/4 = 6 + 14.75 = 20.75\n\nSo the car blocks freeway 1 at T in [18, 20] (since T is integer, T=18,19,20).\n\nSimilarly, the car (-12,-23,right,4) at freeway 1:\n   T >= 6 - (-12)/4 = 6+3 = 9\n   T <= 6 - (-23)/4 = 6+5.75 -> so T in [9,11] (T=9,10,11)\n\nAnd the car (24,13,right,4) at freeway 1: note head=24, tail=13 -> but wait, the representation is (head, tail) and for right-moving the initial span is [tail, head] = [13,24]. Then:\n   Condition: 13+4*(T-6) <= 0 <= 24+4*(T-6)\n   => 13+4*(T-6) <= 0 -> 4*(T-6) <= -13 -> T-6 <= -13/4 = -3.25 -> T<= 6-3.25 = 2.75 -> so T<=2 (if integer and T>=6, then no solution) \n   and 0<=24+4*(T-6) -> always true for T>=6? \n   But wait, the left condition: 13+4*(T-6) <= 0 -> T<= 6 - 13/4 = 6-3.25=2.75 -> so for T>=6, the left end is at least 13+0=13>0, so 0 is not in the interval? \n\nSo the car (24,13,right,4) never covers 0 for T>=6.\n\nTherefore, for freeway 1, it is blocked at T=9,10,11 (by the car (-12,-23,right,4)) and at T=18,19,20 (by the car (-48,-59,right,4)).\n\nSimilarly, we can compute for every freeway.\n\nLet's do it for all freeways:\n\nFreeway 1: \n   car1: (-48,-59,right,4) -> blocks T: [6 - (-48)/4, 6 - (-59)/4] = [6+12, 6+14.75] = [18, 20.75] -> T=18,19,20\n   car2: (-12,-23,right,4) -> T: [6 - (-12)/4, 6 - (-23)/4] = [6+3, 6+5.75] = [9,11.75] -> T=9,10,11\n   car3: (24,13,right,4) -> blocks if: 13+4*(T-6) <= 0 <= 24+4*(T-6). \n        The left condition: 13+4*(T-6)<=0 -> T<= ( -13 )/4 + 6 = -3.25+6 = 2.75 -> so no blocking for T>=6.\n\n   So freeway 1 is blocked at T=9,10,11 and 18,19,20.\n\nFreeway 2: same cars as freeway 1 -> same blocking times: T=9,10,11,18,19,20.\n\nFreeway 3: \n   cars: (48,37,right,6), (12,1,right,6), (-24,-35,right,6)\n\n   For (48,37,right,6): \n        Condition: 37+6*(T-6) <= 0 <= 48+6*(T-6)\n        Left: 37+6*(T-6)<=0 -> 6*(T-6)<=-37 -> T-6<=-37/6≈-6.166 -> T<=6-6.166<0 -> no blocking for T>=6.\n\n   For (12,1,right,6):\n        Condition: 1+6*(T-6) <=0 <= 12+6*(T-6)\n        Left: 1+6*(T-6)<=0 -> 6*(T-6)<=-1 -> T-6<=-1/6 -> T<=6-1/6≈5.833 -> so no blocking for T>=6.\n\n   For (-24,-35,right,6):\n        Condition: -35+6*(T-6) <=0<= -24+6*(T-6)\n        Left: -35+6*(T-6)<=0 -> 6*(T-6)<=35 -> T-6<=35/6≈5.833 -> T<=11.833 -> T=6,7,...,11\n        Right: 0<=-24+6*(T-6) -> 6*(T-6)>=24 -> T-6>=4 -> T>=10\n        So T must be in [10,11.833] -> T=10,11.\n\n   Therefore, freeway 3 is blocked at T=10,11.\n\nFreeway 4: same as freeway 3 -> blocked at T=10,11.\n\nFreeway 5: \n   cars: (48,37,right,12), (12,1,right,12), (-24,-35,right,12)\n\n   For (48,37,right,12): \n        37+12*(T-6)<=0<=48+12*(T-6)\n        Left: 37+12*(T-6)<=0 -> 12*(T-6)<=-37 -> T-6<=-37/12≈-3.083 -> no blocking for T>=6.\n\n   For (12,1,right,12):\n        1+12*(T-6)<=0<=12+12*(T-6)\n        Left: 1+12*(T-6)<=0 -> 12*(T-6)<=-1 -> T-6<=-1/12 -> no blocking.\n\n   For (-24,-35,right,12):\n        -35+12*(T-6)<=0<=-24+12*(T-6)\n        Left: -35+12*(T-6)<=0 -> 12*(T-6)<=35 -> T-6<=35/12≈2.916 -> T<=8.916 -> T=6,7,8\n        Right: 0<=-24+12*(T-6) -> 12*(T-6)>=24 -> T-6>=2 -> T>=8\n        So T in [8,8.916] -> T=8.\n\n   Therefore, freeway 5 is blocked only at T=8.\n\nFreeway 6: \n   car: (48,37,right,3)\n        Condition: 37+3*(T-6)<=0<=48+3*(T-6)\n        Left: 37+3*(T-6)<=0 -> 3*(T-6)<=-37 -> T-6<=-37/3≈-12.33 -> no blocking.\n\n   So freeway 6 is never blocked.\n\nFreeway 7:\n   car: (-48,-71,right,24)\n        Condition: -71+24*(T-6)<=0<=-48+24*(T-6)\n        Left: -71+24*(T-6)<=0 -> 24*(T-6)<=71 -> T-6<=71/24≈2.958 -> T<=8.958 -> T=6,7,8\n        Right: 0<=-48+24*(T-6) -> 24*(T-6)>=48 -> T-6>=2 -> T>=8\n        So T in [8,8.958] -> T=8.\n\nFreeway 8: same as freeway 7: blocked at T=8.\n\nSummary of blocked times per freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: {9,10,11,18,19,20}\nFreeway 2: {9,10,11,18,19,20}\nFreeway 3: {10,11}\nFreeway 4: {10,11}\nFreeway 5: {8}\nFreeway 6: never blocked\nFreeway 7: {8}\nFreeway 8: {8}\n\nNow we plan the moves:\n\nWe start at T=6, y=0.\n\nWe want to go from y=0 to y=9, passing through freeways 1 to 8.\n\nWe can simulate the moves:\n\nWe are going to use BFS. We maintain a queue of states (T, y, path) where T is the current absolute turn, y is the current y, and path is the sequence of actions so far (from T=6 to T-1).\n\nWe start: (6,0,[])\n\nThen we consider actions at T=6: U, D, S.\n\nBut D and S both lead to y=0 at T=7. U leads to y=1 at T=7.\n\nAt T=7, if we are at y=1 (freeway1) -> check if T=7 is blocked? freeway1 is blocked at T=9,10,11,18,19,20 -> 7 is not blocked -> safe.\n\nSimilarly, at y=0: safe.\n\nWe can have:\n\nOption 1: \n   T=6: U -> then T=7, y=1 (safe)\n   Then at T=7: we can choose U, D, S.\n\nBut note: we want to minimize H, so we would prefer going up.\n\nWe'll do BFS by time (T) and we break when we find a path that reaches y=9.\n\nWe'll try to go up as much as possible, but avoiding collisions.\n\nSince freeway1 is safe at T=7, we can go up again at T=7: then T=8, y=2 (freeway2). Freeway2 at T=8: blocked at {9,10,11,18,19,20} -> 8 is safe.\n\nThen at T=8: we can go up to y=3 -> freeway3 at T=8: blocked at {10,11} -> safe.\n\nThen at T=9: we are at y=3 (freeway3) -> T=9: freeway3 blocked at {10,11} -> safe? so we can go up to y=4.\n\nBut wait: at T=9, we are at freeway3? Actually, we are at y=3 at the beginning of turn T=9. Then we choose an action. But we are at freeway3 at time T=9 -> is freeway3 blocked at T=9? Our table says freeway3 is blocked at T=10,11 -> so T=9 is safe.\n\nThen we go up: at T=10, we would be at y=4? But wait: we started at T=6:0, then T=7:1, T=8:2, T=9:3, then if we go up at T=9 we become y=4 at T=10.\n\nBut at T=10, we are at freeway4? Actually, at T=10, we are at y=4 (freeway4). Freeway4 is blocked at T=10,11 -> so T=10 is blocked! So if we are at freeway4 at T=10, we collide.\n\nTherefore, we cannot be at freeway4 at T=10.\n\nSo we must avoid being at freeway4 at T=10 or T=11.\n\nSimilarly, freeway3 is blocked at T=10,11: so we cannot be at freeway3 at T=10 or T=11 either.\n\nWhat about freeway5? blocked only at T=8 -> so at T=10, freeway5 is safe.\n\nBut note: we are at y=3 at T=9. Instead of going up to y=4 (which would lead to collision at T=10 at freeway4), we might choose to stay at y=3? Then at T=10 we are at y=3 (freeway3) -> blocked! because freeway3 is blocked at T=10.\n\nOr we might go down to y=2? Then at T=10 we are at freeway2. Freeway2 is blocked at T=9,10,11 -> so at T=10, freeway2 is blocked.\n\nSo if we are at y=3 at T=9, we cannot stay or go down because then at T=10 we are at freeway3 or freeway2 which are blocked. And we cannot go up because then at T=10 we are at freeway4 which is blocked.\n\nSo we must not be at y=3 at T=9? Then we have to avoid that.\n\nAlternatively, we can slow down earlier.\n\nLet's try to adjust:\n\nWe must avoid freeways 2,3,4 at T=10 and T=11? Actually:\n   freeway2: blocked at T=9,10,11 -> so we must avoid being at freeway2 at T=9,10,11.\n   freeway3: blocked at T=10,11 -> avoid at T=10,11.\n   freeway4: blocked at T=10,11 -> avoid at T=10,11.\n\nBut note: we are at T=8 at y=2 (freeway2). Since freeway2 is safe at T=8 (not blocked) but then at T=9 we must leave freeway2? because if we are at freeway2 at T=9, it is blocked.\n\nSo at T=8: we are at y=2. We can choose:\n   U: then at T=9 we are at y=3 -> freeway3 at T=9: safe (because freeway3 blocked only at 10,11). Then at T=9 we are at y=3 and we must avoid being there at T=10 and T=11. So at T=9 we must leave freeway3? But we can only move to y=2,3,4. \n        If we go up to y=4 at T=9: then at T=10 we are at freeway4 -> blocked.\n        If we go down to y=2 at T=9: then at T=10 we are at freeway2 -> blocked.\n        If we stay at y=3 at T=9: then at T=10 we are at freeway3 -> blocked.\n\n   So we cannot be at y=3 at T=9? \n\n   Alternatively, we can at T=8 (when we are at y=2) choose to not go up? \n\n   At T=8, y=2: \n        Option: D -> then at T=9, y=1 (freeway1). But freeway1 is blocked at T=9? yes, because T=9 is in {9,10,11} -> blocked. So we cannot go down to y=1 at T=9.\n        Option: S -> then at T=9, y=2 -> freeway2 at T=9: blocked.\n\n   Therefore, at T=8 we cannot choose U, D, or S? Then we must have avoided being at y=2 at T=8.\n\nSo we must avoid being at freeway2 at T=8? But freeway2 is not blocked at T=8 (only at 9,10,11,18,19,20). So at T=8 it is safe. But then we get stuck at T=9.\n\nTherefore, we must not be at freeway2 at T=8? Or we must have arrived at a different time.\n\nHow about we slow down earlier? \n\nAt T=6: we start at y=0. Instead of going up at T=6, we might stay or go down? but going down is not useful and staying is safe. \n\nBut then at T=7: we are still at y=0. Then we can go up to y=1 at T=8? \n\nBut freeway1 at T=8: blocked at {9,10,11,...} -> T=8 is safe.\n\nThen at T=8: we are at y=1. Then we can go up to y=2 at T=9 -> freeway2 at T=9: blocked! \n\nOr at T=8: we can stay at y=1? Then at T=9: freeway1 at T=9: blocked.\n\nOr go down to y=0? Then at T=9: safe (not freeway). Then at T=9: we are at y=0, then we can go up at T=9 to y=1? But at T=10: we are at freeway1 at T=10 -> blocked.\n\nSo we need to wait until T=12? because freeway1 is blocked at 9,10,11 and then becomes safe at T=12.\n\nBut then we can:\n\n   T=6: S -> T=7: y=0\n   T=7: S -> T=8: y=0\n   T=8: S -> T=9: y=0\n   T=9: S -> T=10: y=0\n   T=10: S -> T=11: y=0\n   T=11: S -> T=12: y=0 -> then we start moving up.\n\nBut then it takes 6 more steps to go from y=0 to y=9 -> total turns: 6 (from T=6 to T=11) and then 9 moves up? -> 15 turns? \n\nBut we can start moving up earlier? \n\nAt T=6: S -> T=7:0\nT=7: S -> T=8:0\nT=8: S -> T=9:0\nT=9: S -> T=10:0\nT=10: S -> T=11:0\nT=11: U -> T=12: y=1 -> freeway1 at T=12: safe (since blocked only at 9,10,11,18,19,20 -> 12 is safe)\nT=12: U -> T=13: y=2 -> freeway2 at T=13: safe (blocked at 9,10,11,18,19,20 -> 13 safe)\nT=13: U -> T=14: y=3 -> freeway3 at T=14: safe (blocked at 10,11 -> safe)\nT=14: U -> T=15: y=4 -> freeway4 at T=15: safe (blocked at 10,11 -> safe)\nT=15: U -> T=16: y=5 -> freeway5: blocked only at T=8 -> safe\nT=16: U -> T=17: y=6 -> freeway6: never blocked -> safe\nT=17: U -> T=18: y=7 -> freeway7: blocked at T=8 -> safe? but also blocked at T=18? \n\nWait, freeway7: we computed only at T=8. But we computed for freeway7: \n   car: (-48,-71,right,24) -> blocks T=8 only? \n   But let me recalc: \n        Condition: -71+24*(T-6) <=0<= -48+24*(T-6)\n        Left: -71+24*(T-6)<=0 -> 24*(T-6)<=71 -> T<=6+71/24=6+2.958=8.958 -> so T=6,7,8? but we are at T>=6? \n        Right: 0<=-48+24*(T-6) -> 24*(T-6)>=48 -> T-6>=2 -> T>=8.\n        So only T=8? \n\nBut wait, the car is moving right and the span is increasing. At T=18: \n   left_end(18) = -71+24*(12) = -71+288=217\n   right_end(18) = -48+24*12 = -48+288=240\n   Then 0 is not in [217,240] -> so not blocked.\n\nSimilarly, freeway8: same.\n\nBut freeway1 and freeway2 are blocked at T=18,19,20 -> but we are not on freeway1 or 2 at T=18.\n\nSo at T=18: we are at y=7 -> freeway7: safe.\n\nThen T=18: U -> T=19: y=8 -> freeway8 at T=19: safe? freeway8 blocked only at T=8 -> safe.\n\nThen T=19: U -> T=20: y=9 -> done.\n\nTotal actions: from T=6 to T=19 (inclusive) -> 14 actions.\n\nBut is there a faster way?\n\nWe see that the critical period is T=9 to T=11: freeways 1,2,3,4 are blocked. So we must avoid being on freeways 1-4 during T=9,10,11.\n\nWe can be on freeways 5,6,7,8 during that time? \n\nBut note: freeway5 is blocked at T=8 -> so at T=9,10,11 it is safe.\nfreeway6: always safe.\nfreeway7: safe except T=8.\nfreeway8: safe except T=8.\n\nSo we might try to get to freeway5 or above by T=9.\n\nAt T=6: start at y=0.\nWe need to get to at least y=5 by T=9? \n\nBut we have 3 moves: T=6,7,8 -> we can go up 3 times: \n   T=6: U -> T=7: y=1 (safe at T=7)\n   T=7: U -> T=8: y=2 (safe at T=8, because freeway2 blocked at T=9,10,11,18,19,20 -> T=8 safe)\n   T=8: U -> T=9: y=3 -> freeway3 at T=9: safe? yes, because freeway3 blocked at T=10,11 -> but T=9 is safe.\n\nBut then at T=9 we are at y=3, which is freeway3. Then we must avoid being at freeway3 at T=10 and T=11. \n\nWe can go up at T=9 to y=4 -> then at T=10 we are at freeway4 -> blocked.\n\nWe can go down at T=9 to y=2 -> then at T=10 we are at freeway2 -> blocked.\n\nWe can stay at T=9 at y=3 -> then at T=10 we are at freeway3 -> blocked.\n\nSo we are stuck.\n\nAlternatively, we try to go up faster? But we can only go up once per turn.\n\nWe could go up twice and then down? \n\nAt T=6: U -> T=7: y=1\nT=7: U -> T=8: y=2\nT=8: D -> T=9: y=1 -> freeway1 at T=9: blocked.\n\nNot good.\n\nAt T=6: U -> T=7: y=1\nT=7: D -> T=8: y=0 -> then T=8: safe (y=0)\nT=8: U -> T=9: y=1 -> blocked.\n\nNot good.\n\nWhat if we do:\n\n   T=6: U -> y=1 at T=7 (safe)\n   T=7: U -> y=2 at T=8 (safe)\n   T=8: U -> y=3 at T=9 (safe)\n   Then at T=9: we are at y=3. To avoid being at freeway3 at T=10, we must move to a freeway that is not blocked at T=10. The only freeways above 3 that are safe at T=10 are freeway5 and above. But we are at y=3, so we need to go up two steps to get to freeway5? But we only have one move at T=9: we can go up to y=4 -> then at T=10 we are at freeway4 -> blocked.\n\nAlternatively, we can go down to y=2 at T=9? but then at T=10 we are at freeway2 -> blocked.\n\nSo we must have an extra move to jump over the danger zone.\n\nHow about we wait at y=0 until T=12? Then we can go up quickly. But that takes 6 waits (from T=6 to T=11) and then 9 moves up -> 15 moves.\n\nBut we found a path in 14 moves earlier.\n\nBut can we do better?\n\nLet me try to get to freeway5 by T=8? \n\nWe start at T=6: y=0.\n   T=6: U -> T=7: y=1 (safe)\n   T=7: U -> T=8: y=2 (safe) -> but we need to be at y=5 at T=8? we are only at y=2. So not possible.\n\nWhat if we use three moves to go up as fast as possible? \n   T=6: U -> T=7: y=1\n   T=7: U -> T=8: y=2\n   T=8: U -> T=9: y=3 -> then we are at freeway3 at T=9 -> safe, but then we get stuck.\n\nBut note: freeway5 is safe at T=9. If we can get to freeway5 at T=9, then we are safe.\n\nHow to get to y=5 by T=9? \n   We have three moves: T=6,7,8 -> we can only get to y=3.\n\nSo not possible.\n\nAlternatively, we can be at y=4 at T=9? \n   T=6: U -> T=7: y=1\n   T=7: U -> T=8: y=2\n   T=8: U -> T=9: y=3 -> then we need to go up one more to get to y=4? but that's at T=9: if we go up at T=9, then at T=10 we become y=5. But at T=9 we are at y=3, then we go up to y=4 at T=10. Then at T=10 we are at freeway4 -> blocked.\n\nBut if we could be at y=4 at the beginning of T=9, then at T=9 we go up to y=5 -> then at T=10 we are at freeway5, which is safe.\n\nBut how to be at y=4 at the beginning of T=9? \n   We need to make 4 moves in 3 turns? Impossible.\n\nSo we must wait.\n\nBut we also note that freeway6 is always safe. So if we can be at freeway6 at T=10, that's safe.\n\nBut to be at freeway6 (y=6) at T=10, we can:\n\n   We start at T=6:0.\n   We need to go up 6 steps in 4 turns? (from T=6 to T=9: 3 actions -> we can go up 3 times -> y=3 at T=9.\n   Then at T=9: we go up to y=4 at T=10 -> then we are at freeway4 at T=10: blocked.\n\n   Alternatively, if we can be at y=5 at T=9, then at T=9 we go up to y=6 at T=10 -> then at T=10 we are at freeway6: safe.\n\nBut to be at y=5 at T=9, we need 5 moves in 3 turns? impossible.\n\nTherefore, the only way is to wait until after T=11 to start moving through the lower freeways.\n\nBut we also have to avoid freeway1 and freeway2 at T=18,19,20. \n\nIn our earlier slow path, we were at freeway7 at T=18: which is safe. And freeway8 at T=19: safe.\n\nBut what if we start moving earlier? \n\nWe can start moving at T=9? \n\nAt T=6,7,8: we stay at y=0.\nThen at T=9: we go up to y=1 -> but freeway1 at T=9: blocked.\nSo we cannot move at T=9.\n\nAt T=10: freeway1 is still blocked.\n\nAt T=11: freeway1 blocked.\n\nAt T=12: freeway1 safe.\n\nSo we start at T=12: U -> y=1 (safe)\nT=13: U -> y=2 (freeway2: T=13 safe)\nT=14: U -> y=3 (freeway3: T=14 safe)\nT=15: U -> y=4 (freeway4: T=15 safe)\nT=16: U -> y=5 (freeway5: safe)\nT=17: U -> y=6 (freeway6: safe)\nT=18: U -> y=7 (freeway7: safe)\nT=19: U -> y=8 (freeway8: safe)\nT=20: U -> y=9 -> done.\n\nBut note: at T=18, we are at freeway7: safe? yes, because freeway7 only blocked at T=8.\nAt T=19, freeway8: safe.\n\nBut freeway1 is blocked at T=18,19,20 -> but we are not on freeway1 at T=18,19,20.\n\nTotal actions: from T=6 to T=20: 15 actions? \n   We did nothing from T=6 to T=11: that's 6 turns (actions: S at T=6,7,8,9,10,11) -> 6 actions.\n   Then from T=12 to T=20: we do 9 actions (U every turn) -> 9 actions.\n   Total: 15 actions.\n\nBut we found a path in 14 actions earlier? \n\nIn the earlier path we did:\n\n   T=6: S\n   T=7: S\n   T=8: S\n   T=9: S\n   T=10: S\n   T=11: S   -> 6 waits\n   T=12: U -> y=1\n   T=13: U -> y=2\n   T=14: U -> y=3\n   T=15: U -> y=4\n   T=16: U -> y=5\n   T=17: U -> y=6\n   T=18: U -> y=7\n   T=19: U -> y=8\n   Then we need one more U to get to y=9 at T=20.\n\nBut wait, we are at y=8 at T=19. Then we do U at T=19: then at T=20 we are at y=9 -> done.\n\nSo the last action is at T=19. The actions are from T=6 to T=19: that's 14 actions.\n\nSequence: \n   Turn 6: S\n   Turn 7: S\n   Turn 8: S\n   Turn 9: S\n   Turn 10: S\n   Turn 11: S\n   Turn 12: U\n   Turn 13: U\n   Turn 14: U\n   Turn 15: U\n   Turn 16: U\n   Turn 17: U\n   Turn 18: U\n   Turn 19: U\n\nBut is there a faster way? \n\nWhat if we move at T=11? We are at y=0 at T=11. Then we want to go up at T=11: then at T=12 we become y=1. But freeway1 at T=12: safe? yes.\n\nThen we can do:\n\n   T=6: S\n   T=7: S\n   T=8: S\n   T=9: S\n   T=10: S\n   T=11: U   -> T=12: y=1 (safe)\n   Then T=12: U -> y=2\n   T=13: U -> y=3\n   T=14: U -> y=4\n   T=15: U -> y=5\n   T=16: U -> y=6\n   T=17: U -> y=7\n   T=18: U -> y=8\n   T=19: U -> y=9\n\nTotal actions: 14 actions? \n   From T=6 to T=10: 5 S's (T=6,7,8,9,10) -> 5 actions\n   Then T=11: U -> 1 action\n   Then T=12 to T=19: 8 U's -> 8 actions\n   Total: 5+1+8 = 14 actions.\n\nBut wait: we start at T=6, and we have actions at T=6,7,8,9,10,11,12,...,19 -> that's 14 actions.\n\nBut in this sequence, at T=11 we do U: then at T=12 we are at y=1.\n\nWe avoid the blocked period.\n\nBut can we start moving at T=10? \n   At T=10: we are at y=0. If we go up at T=10, then at T=11 we become y=1. \n        freeway1 at T=11: blocked? yes, because freeway1 is blocked at T=11. \n   So we cannot.\n\nTherefore, the earliest we can start moving is at T=11.\n\nSo both sequences (the one with 6 waits and then 8 U's, and the one with 5 waits then a U at T=11 and then 8 U's) are 14 actions.\n\nBut the one with 5 waits and then U at T=11 is also 14 actions.\n\nWe can also consider moving down to avoid the blocked freeways? But it doesn't seem to help.\n\nWe must also check the upper freeways at the time we pass them. In the sequence above, we pass freeway1 at T=12: safe, freeway2 at T=13: safe, ... freeway8 at T=19: safe.\n\nBut what about the car on freeway1 at T=18,19,20? \n   We are on freeway1 at T=12: which is not in {18,19,20} -> safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway2 at T=13: safe.\n\nSo the path is valid.\n\nIs there a path with 13 actions? \n\nThat would mean we reach y=9 at T=19? But we need 9 moves up. We start at y=0 at T=6. We have 13 actions: so from T=6 to T=18 (inclusive) we do 13 actions.\n\nWe must then be at y=9 at T=19.\n\nWe need to have moved up 9 times. The total number of U moves must be 9, and we can have some S or D moves. But the net displacement is +9.\n\nThe minimal number of turns is 9 if there were no obstacles. But with obstacles, we have to wait sometimes.\n\nIn 13 actions, we have 9 U and 4 other moves (S or D). We can use the other moves to wait.\n\nBut we have to avoid the blocked freeways at the times we are on them.\n\nWe try to see if we can get to y=9 in 13 actions.\n\nThe arrival at y=9 would be at T=19 (since we start at T=6 and do 13 actions: T=6 to T=18, then at T=19 we are at y=9).\n\nWe must pass freeway1 at some T. The earliest we can pass freeway1 is T=7 (if we go up at T=6). The latest we can pass freeway1 is T=18 (if we go up 9 times starting late).\n\nBut freeway1 is blocked at T=9,10,11,18,19,20.\n\nWe must avoid freeway1 at T=9,10,11,18,19,20.\n\nSimilarly, freeway2 is blocked at the same times.\n\nfreeway3 and 4 at T=10,11.\n\nfreeway5 at T=8.\n\nfreeway7 and 8 at T=8.\n\nWe cannot be on freeway1 at T=18 because we would be at freeway1 at T=18 if we are moving up and we are at freeway1 at T=18. But then we need to be at freeway2 at T=19? and then freeway3 at T=20? and then we haven't reached y=9 by T=19.\n\nWe are at T=18: we are at freeway1 -> then we go up to freeway2 at T=19 -> then we are at freeway2 at T=19: blocked. So we collide.\n\nTherefore, we cannot be on freeway1 at T=18.\n\nSimilarly, we cannot be on freeway1 at T=19 or 20.\n\nSo the only safe times for freeway1 are T=7,8,12,13,14,15,16,17.\n\nSimilarly for freeway2.\n\nWe need to schedule our moves.\n\nSuppose we do:\n\n   T=6: U -> T=7: y=1 (freeway1: T=7 safe)\n   T=7: U -> T=8: y=2 (freeway2: T=8 safe)\n\nThen at T=8: we are at y=2. We cannot go up to y=3 at T=9 because then we would be at freeway2 at T=9: blocked.\n\nWe could go down to y=1 at T=9: then freeway1 at T=9: blocked.\n\nOr stay at y=2 at T=9: blocked.\n\nSo we must avoid freeway2 at T=9. Therefore, at T=8 we cannot be at y=2? Then we must not have gone up twice in a row.\n\nAlternatively, we could go up only once in the first two moves? \n\n   T=6: U -> T=7: y=1\n   T=7: S -> T=8: y=1 -> freeway1 at T=8: safe.\n\n   Then at T=8: we are at y=1. We can go up to y=2 at T=9: freeway2 at T=9: blocked -> not allowed.\n\n   Or stay at y=1 at T=9: freeway1 at T=9: blocked.\n\n   Or go down to y=0 at T=9: safe.\n\n   Then at T=9: y=0. Then we can go up at T=9? but then at T=10 we become y=1 -> freeway1 at T=10: blocked.\n\n   Or wait at T=9: S -> T=10: y=0.\n\n   Then at T=10: we can go up? but at T=11 we become y=1 -> freeway1 at T=11: blocked.\n\n   So we have to wait until T=12 to go up.\n\n   Then we do:\n        T=6: U\n        T=7: S\n        T=8: D -> T=9: y=0? \n        Then T=9: S\n        T=10: S\n        T=11: S\n        T=12: U -> y=1\n        ... then 8 more U's to get to y=9 at T=20.\n\n   Total actions: 13? from T=6 to T=18: 13 actions -> then at T=19 we are at y=9? \n        Actually, we did:\n          T=6: U -> y=1 at T=7\n          T=7: S -> y=1 at T=8\n          T=8: D -> y=0 at T=9\n          T=9: S -> y=0 at T=10\n          T=10: S -> y=0 at T=11\n          T=11: S -> y=0 at T=12\n          T=12: U -> y=1 at T=13\n          T=13: U -> y=2 at T=14\n          T=14: U -> y=3 at T=15\n          T=15: U -> y=4 at T=16\n          T=16: U -> y=5 at T=17\n          T=17: U -> y=6 at T=18\n          T=18: U -> y=7 at T=19\n          Then we need two more U's: to get to y=9 at T=21? \n\n   We are at y=7 at T=19. We need to get to y=9: two more moves. So total actions: 14 (from T=6 to T=19).\n\nAlternatively, after T=8: D to y=0 at T=9, then we do 9 U's starting at T=9? but we can't at T=9,10,11 because then we would be on freeway1 at T=10,11,12? \n\n   If we do:\n        T=9: U -> T=10: y=1 -> blocked at T=10\n   so we cannot.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 14.\n\nWe can choose the sequence that moves earlier:\n\n   Turn 6: S\n   Turn 7: S\n   Turn 8: S\n   Turn 9: S\n   Turn 10: S\n   Turn 11: U   (at T=11, from y=0 to y=1 at T=12)\n   Turn 12: U   (y=2 at T=13)\n   Turn 13: U   (y=3 at T=14)\n   Turn 14: U   (y=4 at T=15)\n   Turn 15: U   (y=5 at T=16)\n   Turn 16: U   (y=6 at T=17)\n   Turn 17: U   (y=7 at T=18)\n   Turn 18: U   (y=8 at T=19)\n   Turn 19: U   (y=9 at T=20)\n\nBut wait, the last action is at T=19, and then at T=20 we are at y=9. But the sequence of actions is from t1=6 to t1+H-1 = 6+14-1 = 19. So H=14.\n\nBut the problem says: the sequence is {a_{t1+t} for t=0 to H-1. So we have 14 actions: t=0 (relative) corresponds to t1=6, t=1 to t1+1=7, ... t=13 to t1+13=19.\n\nSo we output:\n\nTurn 6: S\nTurn 7: S\nTurn 8: S\nTurn 9: S\nTurn 10: S\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: U\nTurn 16: U\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\nTurn 19: U\n\nBut note: at T=19, we do U and then we become y=9 at T=20. And the goal is to be at (0,9) after the last action. So it meets.\n\nWe can verify the freeways:\n\nAt T=12: we are at y=1 (freeway1) -> T=12: safe (not in {9,10,11,18,19,20})\nAt T=13: y=2 (freeway2) -> T=13: safe\nAt T=14: y=3 (freeway3) -> T=14: safe\nAt T=15: y=4 (freeway4) -> T=15: safe\nAt T=16: y=5 (freeway5) -> T=16: safe (blocked only at T=8)\nAt T=17: y=6 (freeway6) -> safe\nAt T=18: y=7 (freeway7) -> safe (blocked only at T=8)\nAt T=19: y=8 (freeway8) -> safe (blocked only at T=8)\n\nAnd we don't step on any freeway at T=20 because we are at y=9.\n\nSo it's safe.\n\nBut we did 5 S's and 9 U's -> 14 actions.\n\nIs there a way with 13 actions? \n\nSuppose we do 4 S's and 9 U's: \n   Then we use 13 actions.\n\n   The moves: \n        T=6: U? then at T=7: y=1 -> safe.\n        T=7: U -> T=8: y=2 -> safe.\n        Then we have to avoid freeway2 at T=9: so we cannot be at freeway2 at T=9. \n        At T=8: we are at y=2. We can do:\n            Option1: D -> T=9: y=1 -> freeway1 at T=9: blocked.\n            Option2: S -> T=9: y=2 -> blocked.\n            Option3: U -> T=9: y=3 -> freeway3 at T=9: safe? yes, because freeway3 blocked at T=10,11.\n        Then at T=9: y=3. Now we have to avoid freeway3 at T=10 and T=11.\n        At T=9: we can do:\n            Option1: U -> T=10: y=4 -> freeway4 at T=10: blocked.\n            Option2: D -> T=10: y=2 -> freeway2 at T=10: blocked.\n            Option3: S -> T=10: y=3 -> freeway3 at T=10: blocked.\n\n        So stuck.\n\n   Alternatively, at T=8: after y=2, we do D -> T=9: y=1 (blocked) -> not good.\n\n   Or at T=6: S -> T=7: y=0\n        T=7: U -> T=8: y=1 (safe)\n        T=8: U -> T=9: y=2 (blocked) -> not good.\n\n   Or T=6: S\n        T=7: U -> T=8: y=1 (safe)\n        T=8: U -> T=9: y=2 (blocked)\n\n   Or T=6: U\n        T=7: D -> T=8: y=0\n        T=8: U -> T=9: y=1 (blocked)\n\n   Or T=6: U\n        T=7: U\n        T=8: D -> T=9: y=1 (blocked)\n\nSo I don't see a 13-action path.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 14.\n\nWe output the sequence of 14 actions.\n\nWe can also output the sequence that starts with more waits and then U's, but the one that moves at T=11 is fine.\n\nBut note: we could do:\n\n   T=6: S\n   T=7: S\n   T=8: S\n   T=9: S\n   T=10: S\n   T=11: S   -> then we are at y=0 at T=12, then we do 9 U's: \n        T=12: U -> y=1 at T=13\n        ... \n        T=20: U -> y=9 at T=21\n\nBut then we need 15 actions: T=6 to T=20 -> 15 actions.\n\nSo the one with 5 S's and then 9 U's (starting at T=11) is 14 actions.\n\nAlternatively, we can do:\n\n   T=6: S\n   T=7: S\n   T=8: S\n   T=9: S\n   T=10: S\n   T=11: U\n   T=12: U\n   T=13: U\n   T=14: U\n   T=15: U\n   T=16: U\n   T=17: U\n   T=18: U\n   T=19: U\n\nThis is 14 actions.\n\nBut we can also do:\n\n   T=6: S\n   T=7: S\n   T=8: S\n   T=9: S\n   T=10: U   -> but then at T=11: y=1 -> blocked (freeway1 at T=11) -> invalid.\n\nSo we must not do U at T=10.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is fixed.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 6: S\nTurn 7: S\nTurn 8: S\nTurn 9: S\nTurn 10: S\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: U\nTurn 16: U\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\nTurn 19: U\n}\n\nBut note: the current turn is t1=6, and we are to start with action at turn 6.\n\nIn the sequence, we have 14 lines: from turn6 to turn19.\n\nH=14.\n\nWe are done.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 6\\) is 14. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\) by waiting until after the blocked periods (e.g., freeways 1 and 2 are blocked at turns 9-11 and 18-20, freeways 3 and 4 at turns 10-11, freeway 5 at turn 8, and freeways 7 and 8 at turn 8). \n\nThe player stays at \\(y = 0\\) for the first 5 turns (turns 6-10) to avoid collisions. Starting at turn 11, the player moves up consistently for 9 turns to reach \\(y = 9\\) by turn 20. The actions are as follows:\n\n- Turns 6-10: Stay (S) to remain at \\(y = 0\\), avoiding collisions on freeways 1-8 during blocked turns.\n- Turns 11-19: Move up (U) each turn to advance from \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 9\\) safely, as the freeways are clear at these times.\n\nThe sequence ensures that at each turn when the player is on a freeway (\\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\)), no car spans include \\(x = 0\\). Specifically:\n- At turn 12, \\(y = 1\\): Freeway 1 is clear (blocked at 9-11, 18-20).\n- At turn 13, \\(y = 2\\): Freeway 2 is clear.\n- At turn 14, \\(y = 3\\): Freeway 3 is clear (blocked at 10-11).\n- At turn 15, \\(y = 4\\): Freeway 4 is clear.\n- At turn 16, \\(y = 5\\): Freeway 5 is clear (blocked only at turn 8).\n- At turn 17, \\(y = 6\\): Freeway 6 is always clear.\n- At turn 18, \\(y = 7\\): Freeway 7 is clear (blocked only at turn 8).\n- At turn 19, \\(y = 8\\): Freeway 8 is clear.\n\nThe player reaches \\(y = 9\\) at turn 20, which is not a freeway, so no collision check is needed.\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn } 6:  S \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 7:  S \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 8:  S \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 9:  S \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 10: S \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 11: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 12: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 13: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 14: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 15: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 16: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 17: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 18: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 19: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t_1 = 9, and I start at y=0. Each turn, I can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing my y-position by +1, -1, or 0, but I have to stay within y=0 to y=9.\n\nCars are moving on each freeway, and I collide if at some turn T, I'm on a freeway y_T and there's a car on that freeway whose span includes x=0 at that turn. The span moves based on the car's speed and direction. For right-moving cars, the span shifts right over time, for left-moving, it shifts left. But in this problem, all cars seem to be right-moving, based on the data. Let me check the car states.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nFor freeway 1: all right, speed 4\n\nFreeway 2: same as 1\n\nFreeway 3: all right, speed 6\n\nFreeway 4: same as 3\n\nFreeway 5: all right, speed 12\n\nFreeway 6: one car, right, speed 3\n\nFreeway 7: one car, right, speed 24\n\nFreeway 8: one car, right, speed 24\n\nAll cars are right-moving. No left-moving cars mentioned.\n\nAlso, the collision condition: at turn T, if I'm on freeway k (so y_T = k), and for that freeway, there is a car such that 0 is in its span at turn T.\n\nThe note says that if I move to a different y at turn T, I'm not considered on that new y until the next position, so at turn T, I'm still on y_T for collision purposes, and when I move, I arrive at y_{T+1} at the end of the turn, so I check collision for y_{T+1} at turn T+1, I think. Let me read carefully.\n\nThe player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, so after action a_t, position changes to y_{t+1}.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if for the position y_T, and a car on freeway y_T, 0 is in span(T).\n\nBut when I perform action a_t at turn t, I am at y_t, and after action, I go to y_{t+1}.\n\nThe note says: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ span(T) but 0 ∉ span(T+1).\"\n\nLet's parse this.\n\nAt turn T, I am at position y_T. I perform action a_T, which may change my y to y_{T+1}.\n\n- If I stay (S), then y_{T+1} = y_T, so at turn T+1, I am still on the same freeway.\n\n- If I move up or down, y_{T+1} = y_T ± 1.\n\nNow, collision is checked at each turn based on where I am at that turn.\n\nAt turn T, collision occurs if y_T is between 1 and 8 (since freeways are y=1 to 8, and y=0 and y=9 are safe, I assume), and there is a car on that freeway with 0 in span(T).\n\nThe note is emphasizing that at turn T, I am on freeway y_T, so I only care about cars on y_T at turn T. If I move to a different freeway, that happens at the end of the turn, so for collision at turn T, I'm only concerned with y_T.\n\nSimilarly, when I arrive at y_{T+1} at turn T+1, I check for collision on y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nThe note is saying that if I move to y_{T+1} at turn T, I am not on y_{T+1} during turn T, only starting turn T+1.\n\nSo, for example, if at turn T, I am on y=k, and I move to y=k+1, then at turn T, I am on k, so collision check for k at T. At turn T+1, I am on k+1, collision check for k+1 at T+1.\n\nAnd if on k+1 at turn T, there was a car with 0 in span(T), but since I wasn't on k+1 at turn T, no collision. Only if at turn T+1, 0 in span(T+1) on k+1, then collision.\n\nThe note says: \"will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ span(T) but 0 ∉ span(T+1)\" meaning that even if at turn T, there was a car on y_{T+1} covering 0, but since I wasn't there, no problem, and by turn T+1, it might have moved away.\n\nBut in this case, since I'm moving to y_{T+1}, I care about span at T+1 for y_{T+1}.\n\nI think I have it.\n\nNow, back to the problem: I start at turn t_1 = 9, position (0,0). I need to reach (0,9) as quickly as possible.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars, so I don't need to worry about collision there. Only on y=1 to 8.\n\nI need to go from y=0 to y=9, passing through y=1 to 8, but I can move up or down, so I might go down to y=0 or up to y=9, but since I start at 0 and need to go to 9, probably I'll go up, but I might need to wait sometimes to avoid cars.\n\nSince I can move down, but y=0 is safe, so if I go down from y=0, I might go to y=-1? No, y_{t+1} must be in [0,9], so if at y=0, I can only go up or stay, not down. Similarly, at y=9, I can only go down or stay, not up.\n\nPlayer position y_{t+1} must be in [0,9], so:\n\n- At y=0, possible actions: U (to y=1) or S (stay at y=0)\n\n- At y=9, possible actions: D (to y=8) or S (stay at y=9)\n\n- At other y, U, D, or S.\n\nIn this case, I start at y=0, turn 9.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nMinimal turns: since I need to increase y by 9, if no cars, I could go up every turn, taking 9 turns: from turn 9 to turn 17, y from 0 to 9.\n\nBut with cars, I might need to wait or go down sometimes, but going down might not help since I have to go up eventually, and y=0 is safe but staying there doesn't progress.\n\nStaying might be necessary to avoid a car.\n\nNow, let's look at the cars.\n\nFirst, I need to find for each freeway, when it is safe to be there, i.e., when no car has 0 in its span.\n\nSince all cars are right-moving, their spans are moving to the right over time.\n\nFor a right-moving car, span at time T: [τ + s(T - t_1), h + s(T - t_1)] where at t_1, it was [τ, h] with h being head, τ tail? Let's see the notation.\n\nIn the car update:\n\nFor right-moving: Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nAnd head h, tail τ, but which is larger? For right-moving, head should be to the right of tail, so h > τ, so span is [τ, h] meaning from left to right, τ left, h right.\n\nIn the initial state, for example, freeway 1: cars (-48,-59,right,4), but -48 and -59, which is head and tail?\n\nIt says: (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\n\nFor the first car: h = -48, τ = -59, d=right, s=4.\n\nSince d=right, head should be on the right, so if h = -48, τ = -59, then τ = -59 < -48 = h, so yes, head at -48, tail at -59, so span from -59 to -48? No.\n\nIf tail is at τ = -59, head at h = -48, and since right-moving, the car extends from tail to head, so left end is tail, right end is head.\n\nSo span is [τ, h] = [-59, -48]? But -59 < -48, so [ -59, -48] meaning from x=-59 to x=-48.\n\nBut in terms of position, if it's right-moving, at time t_1, it's from x= -59 to x= -48.\n\nThen at time T, since moving right, span becomes [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)] = [-59 + 4(T-9), -48 + 4(T-9)]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, collision occurs if at turn T, I am on freeway k, and for some car on k, 0 is in the span, i.e., τ + s(T-t_1) ≤ 0 ≤ h + s(T-t_1)\n\nSince the span is [left, right] = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)] for right-moving.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but all are right here.\n\nt_1 = 9, current turn.\n\nI need for each freeway and each time, whether 0 is covered by any car.\n\nSince multiple cars per freeway, I need to check if there is any car such that the inequality holds.\n\nNow, for each freeway, let's list the cars and their span functions.\n\nFirst, freeway 1:\n\nCars:\n\n1. h=-48, τ=-59, s=4, d=right (all right)\n\nAt time T, span: left = τ + s(T-9) = -59 + 4(T-9)\n\nright = h + s(T-9) = -48 + 4(T-9)\n\n0 in span if left ≤ 0 ≤ right, so -59 + 4(T-9) ≤ 0 ≤ -48 + 4(T-9)\n\nSimilarly,\n\n2. h=-12, τ=-23, s=4\n\nleft = -23 + 4(T-9)\n\nright = -12 + 4(T-9)\n\n0 in span if -23 +4(T-9) ≤ 0 ≤ -12 +4(T-9)\n\n3. h=24, τ=13, s=4\n\nτ=13, h=24\n\nleft = 13 + 4(T-9)\n\nright = 24 + 4(T-9)\n\n0 in span if 13 +4(T-9) ≤ 0 ≤ 24 +4(T-9)\n\nBut 13 +4(T-9) ≥ 13 >0 for T≥9, so left ≥13>0, so 0 < left, so 0 not in span for this car at any T≥9. Since left starts at 13>0 and increases.\n\nSimilarly, for T=9, left=13>0, so 0 is not ≤ right since left>0, so never covered.\n\nSimilarly, the first car: at T=9, left= -59 +4(0) = -59, right= -48, so -59 ≤ 0 ≤ -48? 0 ≤ -48 is false, so not covered.\n\nSet inequality: -59 +4(T-9) ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ -48 +4(T-9)\n\nFirst inequality: -59 +4(T-9) ≤ 0 => 4(T-9) ≤ 59 => T-9 ≤ 59/4 = 14.75, so T ≤ 23.75, so T≤23 since integer.\n\nSecond inequality: 0 ≤ -48 +4(T-9) => 48 ≤ 4(T-9) => 12 ≤ T-9 => T ≥ 21\n\nSo for T from 21 to 23 inclusive, 0 in span for this car.\n\nSimilarly, second car: h=-12, τ=-23, s=4\n\nleft = -23 +4(T-9)\n\nright = -12 +4(T-9)\n\n0 in span: -23 +4(T-9) ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ -12 +4(T-9)\n\nFirst: -23 +4(T-9) ≤ 0 => 4(T-9) ≤ 23 => T-9 ≤ 5.75 => T≤14.75, so T≤14\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -12 +4(T-9) => 12 ≤ 4(T-9) => 3 ≤ T-9 => T≥12\n\nSo for T=12,13,14.\n\nThird car: as above, never, since left=13+4(T-9)≥13>0.\n\nSo for freeway 1, 0 is covered when:\n\n- By car 1: T=21,22,23\n\n- By car 2: T=12,13,14\n\n- Car 3: never\n\nSo overall, freeway 1 unsafe at T=12,13,14,21,22,23\n\nSafe otherwise.\n\nNow freeway 2: same as freeway 1, since cars are identical: (-48,-59,right,4), (-12,-23,right,4), (24,13,right,4)\n\nSo same as above, unsafe at T=12,13,14,21,22,23\n\nNow freeway 3:\n\nCars: (48,37,right,6), (12,1,right,6), (-24,-35,right,6)\n\nFirst car: h=48, τ=37, s=6\n\nleft = τ + s(T-9) = 37 +6(T-9)\n\nright = h + s(T-9) =48 +6(T-9)\n\n0 in span: 37 +6(T-9) ≤ 0 ≤ 48 +6(T-9)\n\nBut 37 +6(T-9) ≥37>0 for T≥9, so left≥37>0, so 0 not ≤ right since left>0, so never covered.\n\nSecond car: h=12, τ=1, s=6\n\nleft =1 +6(T-9)\n\nright=12 +6(T-9)\n\n0 in span: 1 +6(T-9) ≤ 0 ≤ 12 +6(T-9)\n\nFirst inequality: 1 +6(T-9) ≤ 0 => 6(T-9) ≤ -1 => T-9 ≤ -1/6, impossible since T≥9, so never.\n\nThird car: h=-24, τ=-35, s=6\n\nleft = -35 +6(T-9)\n\nright = -24 +6(T-9)\n\n0 in span: -35 +6(T-9) ≤ 0 ≤ -24 +6(T-9)\n\nFirst: -35 +6(T-9) ≤ 0 => 6(T-9) ≤ 35 => T-9 ≤ 35/6 ≈ 5.833 => T≤14.833, so T≤14\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -24 +6(T-9) => 24 ≤ 6(T-9) => 4 ≤ T-9 => T≥13\n\nSo for T=13,14\n\nNow, are there other cars?

But let's confirm.\n\nAt T=9, left=37, right=48, both >0.\n\nAs T increases, left and right increase, so always >0, so 0 never in span. So freeway 6 is always safe.\n\nNow freeway 7: one car (-48,-71,right,24)\n\nh=-48, τ=-71, s=24\n\nleft = τ + s(T-9) = -71 +24(T-9)\n\nright = h + s(T-9) = -48 +24(T-9)\n\n0 in span: -71 +24(T-9) ≤ 0 ≤ -48 +24(T-9)\n\nFirst inequality: -71 +24(T-9) ≤ 0 => 24(T-9) ≤ 71 => T-9 ≤ 71/24 ≈ 2.958 => T≤11.958, so T≤11\n\nSecond inequality: 0 ≤ -48 +24(T-9) => 48 ≤ 24(T-9) => 2 ≤ T-9 => T≥11\n\nSo for T=11\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8: same car (-48,-71,right,24), so unsafe at T=11.\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway, times when unsafe (0 covered):\n\ny=1: unsafe T=12,13,14,21,22,23\n\ny=2: same, T=12,13,14,21,22,23\n\ny=3: unsafe T=13,14\n\ny=4: unsafe T=13,14\n\ny=5: unsafe T=11\n\ny=6: always safe\n\ny=7: unsafe T=11\n\ny=8: unsafe T=11\n\ny=6 is always safe.\n\nI need to go from y=0 at turn 9 to y=9 at some turn.\n\nLet me denote the turn number from current: since t_1=9, let τ = T - t_1, so τ=0 is current turn.\n\nAt τ=0, turn 9, position y=0.\n\nAfter H turns, at turn t_1 + H, position should be y=9? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence of actions from t=0 to H-1 for the offset.\n\nDefine time offset: let t be the number of turns after t_1, so at t=0, turn t_1=9, y=0.\n\nAfter k actions, at turn t_1 + k, position y_k.\n\nWe start at t=0, y=0.\n\nAfter first action, at t=1, y = y_0 + Δy_0, but y_0=0, so y_1 = Δy_0.\n\nGenerally, after t actions, at turn t_1 + t, position y_t.\n\nWe need y_H = 9 for some H.\n\nThe minimal H to reach y=9.\n\ny_t changes by -1,0,+1 each step.\n\nSince we start at 0 and need to be at 9, the minimal number of moves is 9, if we always go up.\n\nBut we might need to stay or go down to avoid collisions, which would increase H.\n\nWe can go directly up, but need to check for collisions on the way.\n\nFirst, let's list the unsafe times for each y, in terms of τ = T - t_1.\n\nt_1=9, so T = τ + 9.\n\nFor y=1: unsafe at τ=12-9=3,13-9=4,14-9=5,21-9=12,22-9=13,23-9=14\n\nSo τ=3,4,5,12,13,14\n\ny=2: same, τ=3,4,5,12,13,14\n\ny=3: unsafe T=13,14, so τ=4,5\n\ny=4: same, τ=4,5\n\ny=5: unsafe T=11, τ=2\n\ny=6: always safe\n\ny=7: unsafe T=11, τ=2\n\ny=8: unsafe T=11, τ=2\n\ny=6 safe always.\n\nNow, I need to have a path from y=0 to y=9 in min steps.\n\nAt each step, based on current y, I choose action to go to next y.\n\nCollision only when on y=1 to 8 at that turn.\n\nSince y=0 and y=9 safe, no issue.\n\nNow, to minimize H, I should go up as much as possible, but avoid being on unsafe y at unsafe τ.\n\nStart at t=0, τ=0, y=0. Safe, no issue.\n\nAt t=0, I am at y=0, I can choose action: U to go to y=1, or S to stay at y=0.\n\nIf I go U, at next turn t=1, I will be at y=1, and I need to check for collision on y=1 at turn t=1 (which is τ=1).\n\nTurn: at time offset t, the turn number is t_1 + t.\n\nPosition: after t actions, at turn t_1 + t, y_t.\n\nAt turn t_1 + t, I am on freeway y_t.\n\nCollision if y_t between 1 and 8, and for that y_t, at time τ=t (since τ = (t_1 + t) - t_1 = t), it is unsafe.\n\nτ = t, the offset.\n\nFor example, at turn t_1 + t, τ = t.\n\nSo at step t (after t actions), position y_t, and if 1≤ y_t ≤8, then unsafe if (y_t, t) is unsafe according to above.\n\ny_t is the freeway number at that turn.\n\nNow, I need y_H =9 for some H.\n\nStart: t=0, y=0.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nPossible actions:\n\nAt t=0, y=0, I can:\n\n- U: go to y=1 at t=1\n\n- S: stay at y=0 at t=1, but y=0 safe, but not progressing.\n\nSince I need to go to y=9, probably better to go up.\n\nBut let's see when y=1 is unsafe.\n\ny=1 unsafe at τ=3,4,5,12,13,14\n\nτ=t, so at t=3,4,5,12,13,14\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSince y=6 is always safe, and I need to pass through, I can go directly to y=6 if possible, but I have to go step by step.\n\nThe minimal time to reach y=9 is 9 steps if always up.\n\nBut let's check if I can go up every turn without collision.\n\nStart t=0, y=0\n\nAction U: to y=1 at t=1\n\nAt t=1, y=1, τ=1\n\nIs y=1 safe at τ=1? From above, y=1 unsafe at τ=3,4,5,12,13,14, so at τ=1, safe. So ok.\n\nThen from y=1, action U: to y=2 at t=2\n\nAt t=2, y=2, τ=2\n\ny=2 unsafe at same τ=3,4,5,12,13,14, so at τ=2, safe. Ok.\n\nThen from y=2, action U: to y=3 at t=3\n\nAt t=3, y=3, τ=3\n\ny=3 unsafe at τ=4,5 only? From above, y=3 unsafe at τ=4,5 (since T=13,14, τ=4,5)\n\nAt τ=3, y=3 should be safe? Let me confirm.\n\ny=3 unsafe only at τ=4 and 5.\n\nτ=3 not unsafe, so safe at τ=3.\n\nSimilarly, y=1 and y=2 unsafe at τ=3,4,5, but we are at y=3 at τ=3, which is not unsafe for y=3.\n\nSo at t=3, y=3, safe.\n\nThen action U: to y=4 at t=4\n\nAt t=4, y=4, τ=4\n\ny=4 unsafe at τ=4,5? y=4 same as y=3, unsafe τ=4,5.\n\nSo at τ=4, y=4 unsafe! Collision.\n\nCannot go to y=4 at t=4.\n\nSo if I go straight up, at t=4, I would be on y=4 at τ=4, which is unsafe.\n\nSo collision.\n\nThus, I need to avoid that.\n\nAt t=3, y=3, instead of going up to y=4, I could stay or go down.\n\nBut going down to y=2 at t=4.\n\nAt t=4, if I go to y=2, τ=4, y=2 unsafe at τ=4, since τ=4 is in 3,4,5.\n\ny=2 unsafe τ=3,4,5, so at τ=4, unsafe.\n\nIf I stay at y=3 at t=4, but y=3 unsafe at τ=4, also unsafe.\n\nSo at t=3, y=3, whatever I do, if I go to y=4, or stay at y=3, or go to y=2, all unsafe at τ=4? y=2, y=3, y=4 all unsafe at τ=4.\n\ny=2 unsafe τ=3,4,5; y=3 unsafe τ=4,5; y=4 unsafe τ=4,5.\n\nAt τ=4, y=2,3,4 are all unsafe.\n\ny=1 also unsafe at τ=4, but we are not there.\n\nSo at τ=4, freeways 1,2,3,4 are all unsafe.\n\ny=1 and 2 unsafe τ=3,4,5; y=3 and4 unsafe τ=4,5.\n\nSo at τ=4, y=1,2,3,4 all unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, at τ=5, same.\n\nBut y=5,6,7,8: y=5 unsafe only τ=2, y=6 safe, y=7 unsafe τ=2, y=8 unsafe τ=2.\n\nAt τ=4, y=5,6,7,8 are safe except y=5 and y=7,8 unsafe only at τ=2, so at τ=4, safe.\n\ny=5 unsafe only at τ=2, so at τ=4, safe; similarly y=7 and8 unsafe at τ=2 only, so at τ=4, safe; y=6 always safe.\n\nSo at τ=4, only y=1,2,3,4 unsafe; y=5,6,7,8 safe.\n\nBack to the path.\n\nAt t=3, y=3, τ=3.\n\nAt τ=3, y=3 is safe, as we have.\n\nBut if I go up to y=4 at t=4, τ=4, unsafe.\n\nIf I stay, at t=4, y=3, τ=4, unsafe.\n\nIf I go down to y=2 at t=4, τ=4, y=2 unsafe.\n\nSo no action from y=3 at t=3 can avoid collision at t=4? Because all possible positions at t=4 would be y=2,3,4, all unsafe at τ=4.\n\ny=2,3,4 all unsafe at τ=4.\n\nBut I cannot jump to y=5 directly.\n\nSo at t=3, I am stuck; whatever I do, at t=4 I will be on an unsafe position.\n\nTherefore, I cannot be at y=3 at t=3, because from there I have to move to t=4 on y=2,3, or4, all unsafe.\n\nSo I need to avoid being at y=3 at t=3.\n\nAt t=3, I should not be at y=3.\n\nSimilarly, for other times.\n\nI need to plan a path that avoids being on unsafe (y,t) pairs.\n\nSince the unsafe times are for specific y and t, I need to choose when to be on which y.\n\nI could stay at y=0 for some time or go down, but y=0 is safe, but not progressing.\n\nSince y=6 is always safe, I might go to y=6 and stay there until it's time to go up, but I need to reach y=9.\n\nFirst, let's list all unsafe (y,τ) for τ≥0.\n\ny=1: unsafe τ=3,4,5,12,13,14\n\ny=2: unsafe τ=3,4,5,12,13,14\n\ny=3: unsafe τ=4,5\n\ny=4: unsafe τ=4,5\n\ny=5: unsafe τ=2\n\ny=6: always safe\n\ny=7: unsafe τ=2\n\ny=8: unsafe τ=2\n\nFor y=3 and4, unsafe only at τ=4 and5.\n\nNow, I start at τ=0, y=0.\n\nI need to reach y=9 at some τ.\n\nMin τ to reach y=9 is 9 if always up.\n\nBut as we saw, if I go up, at τ=3, y=3, which is safe, but then at τ=4, I must go to y=4, which is unsafe.\n\nI could delay going up.\n\nFor example, at τ=0, y=0, I can stay at y=0 for some turns.\n\nThen go up later.\n\nBut that might take more time.\n\nSince y=6 is safe, I could go to y=6 quickly and wait there.\n\nBut to go to y=6, I need 6 steps up, but I might have to avoid unsafe times.\n\nLet's find a path.\n\nI need to be careful around τ=4 and5 for y=3 and4.\n\nAlso, at τ=2, y=5,7,8 are unsafe.\n\nBut y=6 is safe.\n\nNow, let's think about when to be on each row.\n\nI can consider the position over time.\n\nStart at τ=0, y=0. Safe.\n\nAt τ=0, I can choose to go to y=1 at τ=1 or stay.\n\nIf I stay at y=0 for one turn, at τ=1, I am still at y=0, then I can go to y=1 at τ=2, etc.\n\nBut staying at y=0 doesn't help much.\n\nI could go up to y=1 at τ=1, which is safe, as before.\n\nThen at τ=1, y=1, I can choose to go to y=2 at τ=2 or stay or down.\n\nIf I go to y=2 at τ=2, safe since y=2 unsafe only at τ=3,4,5,12,13,14, so at τ=2 safe.\n\nThen at τ=2, y=2, I need to go to next.\n\nIf I go up to y=3 at τ=3, which is safe for y=3 at τ=3.\n\nBut then at τ=3, y=3, I have a problem for τ=4.\n\nAt τ=3, y=3, I cannot go to y=4, stay, or down to y=2 at τ=4, all unsafe at τ=4.\n\nSo I must avoid being at y=3 at τ=3.\n\nTherefore, at τ=2, I should not go to y=3, but do something else.\n\nAt τ=2, y=2, I could stay at y=2 or go down to y=1.\n\nBut at τ=2, y=2 is safe, but if I stay, at τ=3, y=2, which is unsafe since y=2 unsafe at τ=3.\n\nIf I go down to y=1 at τ=3, y=1 unsafe at τ=3.\n\nSo both bad.\n\nTherefore, at τ=2, I should not be at y=2 either, because from there, at τ=3, I must go to y=1,2, or3, all of which are unsafe at τ=3.\n\ny=1,2,3 all unsafe at τ=3? y=1 and2 unsafe at τ=3, y=3 unsafe at τ=3? y=3 unsafe at τ=4 and5, not at τ=3.\n\nAt τ=3, y=3 is safe, as we said.\n\nBut the problem is at τ=4, not τ=3.\n\nAt τ=2, if I am at y=2, I can:\n\n- Go U to y=3 at τ=3: safe\n\n- Go S to y=2 at τ=3: unsafe because y=2 unsafe at τ=3\n\n- Go D to y=1 at τ=3: unsafe because y=1 unsafe at τ=3\n\nSo only possible action from y=2 at τ=2 is to go up to y=3 at τ=3, which is safe.\n\nBut then at τ=3, y=3, I am stuck for τ=4.\n\nSo to prevent that, I need to not be at y=2 at τ=2, so that I don't have to go to y=3 at τ=3.\n\nSimilarly, I should delay my ascent.\n\nFor example, at τ=0, y=0, I can stay for one turn: action S, then at τ=1, still y=0.\n\nThen at τ=1, I can go U to y=1 at τ=2.\n\nAt τ=2, y=1, is it safe? y=1 unsafe at τ=3,4,5,12,13,14, so at τ=2, safe.\n\nThen at τ=2, y=1, I can go U to y=2 at τ=3.\n\nBut at τ=3, y=2 is unsafe, since y=2 unsafe at τ=3.\n\nIf I go S to y=1 at τ=3, unsafe.\n\nIf I go D to y=0 at τ=3, y=0 safe, but then I am at y=0, not progressing.\n\nSo from y=1 at τ=2, the only safe choice is to go down to y=0 at τ=3, since y=0 safe.\n\nThen at τ=3, y=0, I can go U to y=1 at τ=4.\n\nAt τ=4, y=1, but y=1 unsafe at τ=4, collision.\n\nNot good.\n\nAt τ=2, y=1, I could go U to y=2 at τ=3, but unsafe.\n\nNo good option.\n\nPerhaps stay at y=0 longer.\n\nAt τ=0, y=0, stay S, at τ=1, y=0.\n\nStay S again, at τ=2, y=0.\n\nThen at τ=2, y=0, go U to y=1 at τ=3.\n\nAt τ=3, y=1, unsafe! Because y=1 unsafe at τ=3.\n\nSo collision.\n\nIf I go U at τ=0 to y=1 at τ=1, safe.\n\nThen at τ=1, y=1, instead of going to y=2, I can stay at y=1 or go down.\n\nBut at τ=1, y=1 is safe.\n\nIf I stay at y=1 at τ=2, y=1 safe at τ=2? τ=2, y=1 unsafe only at τ=3,4,5, etc, so at τ=2 safe.\n\nBut if I stay at y=1 at τ=2, then at τ=2, y=1 safe.\n\nThen at τ=2, y=1, I can go U to y=2 at τ=3, but y=2 unsafe at τ=3.\n\nGo S to y=1 at τ=3, unsafe.\n\nGo D to y=0 at τ=3, safe.\n\nThen at τ=3, y=0, then I can go U to y=1 at τ=4, but y=1 unsafe at τ=4.\n\nSame problem.\n\nSo I need to be at a different y at τ=4.\n\nAt τ=4, the safe y are y=5,6,7,8.\n\ny=5,6,7,8 are all safe at τ=4.\n\nSimilarly at τ=5, same.\n\nBut to be at y=5 at τ=4, for example, I need to have reached there by moving up.\n\nFor instance, if I can be at y=4 at τ=3, then go U to y=5 at τ=4.\n\nBut at τ=3, y=4 is unsafe, since y=4 unsafe at τ=4? y=4 unsafe at τ=4 and5, so at τ=3, is it safe?\n\ny=4 unsafe at τ=4 and5, so at τ=3, it should be safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=3 at τ=3 safe.\n\nBut the problem is getting to τ=4.\n\nLet's list the safe (y,τ) for τ from 0 to say 15.\n\nFor each τ, which y are safe.\n\nAt τ=0: y=0 safe, y=1 to8: y=1 safe (unsafe at 3,4,5,...), similarly all except possibly y=5,7,8 at τ=2 but τ=0 safe.\n\ny=5 unsafe only τ=2, so at τ=0 safe; similarly others.\n\nAt τ=0, all y safe except no, y=0 and9 always safe, but at τ=0, we are at y=0.\n\nBut for other y, at τ=0, y=1: unsafe at τ=3,4,5,12,13,14, so at τ=0 safe; similarly all safe at τ=0 except we are not on them.\n\nBut the point is, I can be on any y at τ=0 except we start at y=0.\n\nBut for later.\n\nLet's make a table for τ and y, safe or not.\n\ny from 0 to 9, τ from 0.\n\ny=0: always safe\n\ny=9: always safe\n\ny=1: unsafe τ=3,4,5,12,13,14 else safe\n\ny=2: same, unsafe τ=3,4,5,12,13,14 else safe\n\ny=3: unsafe τ=4,5 else safe\n\ny=4: unsafe τ=4,5 else safe\n\ny=5: unsafe τ=2 else safe\n\ny=6: always safe\n\ny=7: unsafe τ=2 else safe\n\ny=8: unsafe τ=2 else safe\n\nNow, for τ=0: all safe except not on y=1-8 yet.\n\nAt τ=0, we are at y=0.\n\nNow, I need to move to y=9.\n\nTo reach high y quickly, but avoid the unsafe times.\n\nFor example, at τ=4 and τ=5, y=1,2,3,4 are unsafe, so I should not be on them.\n\nAt τ=2, y=5,7,8 are unsafe, so avoid being on them at τ=2.\n\nBut y=6 safe at all times.\n\nSo one strategy: go directly to y=6 as fast as possible, then stay there until after τ=5, then go up to y=9.\n\nBut I have to go through the lower rows.\n\nFrom y=0 to y=6, I need 6 steps up.\n\nBut I need to time it so that I am not on unsafe positions.\n\nFor example, if I start going up at τ=0.\n\nτ=0: y=0, go U to y=1 at τ=1\n\nτ=1: y=1, safe (since unsafe only from τ=3)\n\nGo U to y=2 at τ=2\n\nτ=2: y=2, safe (unsafe from τ=3)\n\nNow at τ=2, y=2, I can go U to y=3 at τ=3\n\nτ=3: y=3, safe (unsafe at τ=4,5)\n\nThen at τ=3, y=3, I need to go to next, but at τ=4, y=3,4 unsafe, y=2 also unsafe, so I cannot go to y=4, stay, or down to y=2.\n\nAll unsafe at τ=4.\n\nBut at τ=3, I could go down or something, but let's see.\n\nFrom y=3 at τ=3, I could go down to y=2 at τ=4, but y=2 unsafe at τ=4.\n\nNot good.\n\nGo down to y=1 at τ=4, unsafe.\n\nOr stay, unsafe.\n\nNo.\n\nSo I need to be at a different y at τ=3 or τ=4.\n\nPerhaps at τ=2, instead of going to y=3, I can go to y=1 or something.\n\nAt τ=2, y=2, I can go down to y=1 at τ=3.\n\nBut at τ=3, y=1 unsafe.\n\nGo stay at y=2 at τ=3, unsafe.\n\nSo only up to y=3 is possible, but then stuck.\n\nTherefore, I must not be at y=2 at τ=2.\n\nSimilarly, not at y=1 at τ=2 or something.\n\nLet's see where I can be at each τ to have options.\n\nFor example, at τ=2, I should be at a position where I can move to a safe y at τ=3 and τ=4.\n\nAt τ=2, the safe y are: y=0,1,2,3,4,6,7,8? y=5 unsafe at τ=2, y=7 unsafe at τ=2, y=8 unsafe at τ=2, so at τ=2, unsafe for y=5,7,8.\n\nSafe for y=0,1,2,3,4,6.\n\nBut if I am at y=2 at τ=2, I can only move to y=1,2,3 at τ=3.\n\nAt τ=3, y=1 unsafe, y=2 unsafe, y=3 safe.\n\nSo I can go to y=3 at τ=3.\n\nThen at τ=3, y=3, I can move to y=2,3,4 at τ=4.\n\nAt τ=4, y=2 unsafe, y=3 unsafe, y=4 unsafe, all unsafe, so no move to safe position.\n\nSimilarly, if I am at y=1 at τ=2, I can move to y=0,1,2 at τ=3.\n\nAt τ=3, y=0 safe, y=1 unsafe, y=2 unsafe, so only can go to y=0.\n\nThen at τ=3, y=0, I can move to y=0 or y=1 at τ=4.\n\nAt τ=4, y=0 safe, y=1 unsafe, so I can go to y=0 or stay, but not up.\n\nIf I go to y=1, unsafe.\n\nSo I can stay at y=0 at τ=4, safe, but not progressing.\n\nThen later I can go up.\n\nBut at τ=4, I can stay at y=0, then at τ=5, go to y=1, but at τ=5, y=1 unsafe, collision.\n\nIf I stay at y=0 at τ=4, then at τ=5, I can go to y=1, but y=1 unsafe at τ=5.\n\nOr stay, etc.\n\nSo to go up, I need to wait until after τ=5.\n\nFor example, at τ=6, I can start going up.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nAnother idea: go to y=6 quickly, since it's always safe.\n\nTo go to y=6 from y=0 in 6 steps.\n\nBut the earliest I can be at y=6 is at τ=6, if I go up every turn from τ=0.\n\nBut at τ=6, y=6, safe.\n\nBut to reach there, I need to go through lower y.\n\nFor example, at τ=1, y=1 if I go U at τ=0.\n\nAt τ=1, y=1 safe.\n\nThen U to y=2 at τ=2, safe.\n\nU to y=3 at τ=3, safe.\n\nU to y=4 at τ=4, but at τ=4, y=4 unsafe! Because y=4 unsafe at τ=4.\n\nSo I cannot go directly to y=4 at τ=4.\n\nIf I go U from y=3 at τ=3 to y=4 at τ=4, unsafe.\n\nSo I need to reach y=4 at a different time.\n\nFor example, if I am at y=3 at τ=3, I can stay at y=3 for one turn? But at τ=4, y=3 unsafe.\n\nOr go down, but down to y=2 at τ=4, unsafe.\n\nSo not possible.\n\nTherefore, I cannot be at y=3 or y=4 at τ=4 or τ=5.\n\nSimilarly, I cannot be at y=1 or2 at τ=3,4,5.\n\nSo for τ=3,4,5, I should not be on y=1,2,3,4.\n\nI should be on y=0, or y=5,6,7,8, or y=9.\n\nBut y=5,7,8 are unsafe at τ=2, but at τ=3,4,5 they are safe.\n\nAt τ=3, y=5 safe, y=6 safe, y=7 safe, y=8 safe.\n\nSimilarly at τ=4 and5.\n\nSo during τ=3,4,5, I can be on y=5,6,7,8.\n\nBut to be on y=5 at τ=3, for example, I need to have reached there by τ=3.\n\nFrom start, to reach y=5 at τ=3, I need to go up 5 steps in 3 turns, which is impossible since max I can go is 3 up in 3 turns, to y=3.\n\nMin turns to reach y=5 is 5 turns, at τ=5.\n\nSimilarly, to be on y=6 at τ=3, impossible, min at τ=6.\n\nSo at τ=3, the highest I can be is y=3, which is in the unsafe zone for τ=4.\n\nBut at τ=3, I can be at y=3, which is safe, but then at τ=4, I have no safe move.\n\nSo for τ=4, I need to be on y=5 or higher, but I can't reach by τ=4.\n\nAt τ=4, I can be at y=4 if I go up every time, but y=4 unsafe at τ=4.\n\nOr y=3,2,1,0, all lower.\n\nSo at τ=4, the only safe y are 5,6,7,8, but I can't be on them because I can't reach that high in 4 turns from y=0.\n\nFrom τ=0 to τ=4, after 4 actions, y can be from 0 to 4, since start at 0, after 4 actions, y=4 if all U.\n\nBut y=4 unsafe at τ=4.\n\ny=3 if one S or D, but y=3 unsafe at τ=4.\n\ny=2,1,0 also unsafe or safe but low.\n\ny=0 safe at τ=4, but then I am at y=0, and I need to go up later.\n\nSimilarly at τ=5, similar issue.\n\nSo to avoid collision, at τ=4 and τ=5, I must be on y=0 or y=5+, but y=5+ unreachable, so only y=0 is safe.\n\nSimilarly for τ=3, at τ=3, I can be on y=3, which is safe, but then I have to move to unsafe at τ=4.\n\nOr I can be on lower y.\n\nBut if I am on y=0 at τ=3, I can stay there or go to y=1 at τ=4, but y=1 unsafe at τ=4.\n\nSo only stay at y=0.\n\nTherefore, the only way to avoid collision at τ=4 and τ=5 is to be at y=0 at those times.\n\nSimilarly, for τ=3, I can be at y=0 or y=3, but if at y=3, I am forced to move to unsafe at τ=4, so I should be at y=0 at τ=3 as well.\n\nLet's see.\n\nIf I am at y=0 at τ=3, then at τ=3, I can choose to stay at y=0 or go to y=1.\n\nIf I go to y=1 at τ=4, unsafe.\n\nSo I must stay at y=0 at τ=4 as well.\n\nSimilarly for τ=5.\n\nSo I need to be at y=0 from τ=3 to τ=5, for example.\n\nThen after τ=5, I can start going up.\n\nLet's try that.\n\nStart at τ=0, y=0.\n\nI can go U to y=1 at τ=1, safe.\n\nThen at τ=1, y=1, instead of going up, I can go down to y=0 at τ=2, for example.\n\nAt τ=1, y=1, action D: to y=0 at τ=2.\n\nAt τ=2, y=0, safe.\n\nThen at τ=2, y=0, I can stay or go U.\n\nIf I go U to y=1 at τ=3, but at τ=3, y=1 unsafe.\n\nSo I should stay at y=0 at τ=3.\n\nAction S, to y=0 at τ=3.\n\nAt τ=3, y=0, safe.\n\nThen to be at y=0 at τ=4, I can stay at y=0 at τ=4.\n\nAction S, to y=0 at τ=4.\n\nAt τ=4, y=0, safe.\n\nSimilarly, at τ=4, stay S to y=0 at τ=5.\n\nAt τ=5, y=0, safe.\n\nNow, at τ=5, y=0, I can go U to y=1 at τ=6.\n\nAt τ=6, y=1, is it safe? y=1 unsafe at τ=3,4,5,12,13,14, so at τ=6, safe.\n\nThen I can start going up.\n\nNow, I need to go to y=9.\n\nFrom τ=6, y=0, go U to y=1 at τ=7? Let's list the turns.\n\nAfter actions:\n\nτ=0: start y=0\n\nAction at τ=0: let's define the actions at each step.\n\nAt time offset t, at turn t_1 + t, I am at y_t, then I choose action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nFor t from 0.\n\nAt t=0: position y=0, choose a_0.\n\nIf I want to be at y=0 at t=3,4,5.\n\nFrom above:\n\nAt t=0: y=0, I can go U to y=1 at t=1 or S to y=0 at t=1.\n\nI need to be at y=0 at t=3,4,5.\n\nSo at t=0, I should go U to y=1 at t=1, so that I can come back.\n\nAt t=0: action U, so y=1 at t=1\n\nAt t=1: position y=1, I can go D to y=0 at t=2\n\nAt t=2: position y=0, I can go S to y=0 at t=3 (stay)\n\nAt t=3: position y=0, action S to y=0 at t=4\n\nAt t=4: position y=0, action S to y=0 at t=5\n\nAt t=5: position y=0, now I can go U to y=1 at t=6\n\nAt t=6: position y=1, which is safe as above.\n\nThen from here, I need to go to y=9.\n\ny=1 at t=6, τ=6.\n\nNow, I can go up.\n\nBut there are unsafe times later, like at τ=12,13,14 for y=1 and2.\n\nBut τ=12 is far, t=12, which is turn t_1 +12 =9+12=21.\n\nI can go up continuously if possible.\n\nFrom y=1 at t=6, go U to y=2 at t=7\n\nAt t=7, y=2, τ=7, y=2 unsafe at τ=3,4,5,12,13,14, so at τ=7 safe.\n\nGo U to y=3 at t=8\n\nAt t=8, y=3, τ=8, y=3 unsafe only τ=4,5, so at τ=8 safe.\n\nGo U to y=4 at t=9\n\nAt t=9, y=4, τ=9, y=4 unsafe τ=4,5, so at τ=9 safe.\n\nGo U to y=5 at t=10\n\nAt t=10, y=5, τ=10, y=5 unsafe only τ=2, so at τ=10 safe.\n\nGo U to y=6 at t=11\n\nAt t=11, y=6, τ=11, always safe.\n\nGo U to y=7 at t=12\n\nAt t=12, y=7, τ=12, y=7 unsafe only τ=2, so at τ=12 safe.\n\nGo U to y=8 at t=13\n\nAt t=13, y=8, τ=13, y=8 unsafe only τ=2, so at τ=13 safe.\n\nGo U to y=9 at t=14\n\nAt t=14, y=9, which is safe, and we are done.\n\ny=9 is safe, no cars.\n\nNow, check if any collision: we were on freeways only from t=6 to t=13.\n\nt=6: y=1, τ=6, safe\n\nt=7: y=2, τ=7, safe\n\nt=8: y=3, τ=8, safe\n\nt=9: y=4, τ=9, safe\n\nt=10: y=5, τ=10, safe\n\nt=11: y=6, τ=11, safe\n\nt=12: y=7, τ=12, safe\n\nt=13: y=8, τ=13, safe\n\nt=14: y=9, safe\n\nNow, what about the later unsafe times, like τ=12,13,14 for y=1 and2, but we were on y=1 at τ=6, not τ=12, and on y=2 at τ=7, not τ=12,13,14. At τ=12, we were on y=7, which is fine.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nIn this path, I reached y=9 at t=14, so H=14 actions? Let's see the number of actions.\n\nStarted at t=0, after H actions, at turn t_1 + H, position y_H.\n\nWe need y_H =9.\n\nIn this case, at t=14, y=9.\n\nt from 0 to 14, that's 15 steps? No.\n\nDefine: at time offset t, before any action, position at turn t_1 + t is y_t.\n\nAfter choosing action a_t, we move to y_{t+1} at turn t_1 + t + 1? Let's clarify the timing.\n\nThe player position: at turn t_1, position (0, y_t) with y_t=0.\n\nThen after action a_t, at turn t_1 +1, position y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nIn the sequence, the position at turn t_1 + t is after t actions from start.\n\nStart: turn t_1, position y=0.\n\nAfter first action a_{t_1}, position at turn t_1 +1 is y1.\n\nGenerally, after k actions, at turn t_1 + k, position y_k.\n\nWe start with k=0, turn t_1, y_0=0.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t_1 + H, position y_H.\n\nWe need y_H =9.\n\nIn the path above:\n\nAt turn t_1 +0: y=0\n\nAction a_{t_1}: U, so at turn t_1 +1: y=1\n\nAction a_{t_1 +1}: D? In my earlier, I had:\n\nIn terms of offset:\n\nAt t=0 (turn t_1): position y=0, action a_0 = U, to y=1 at t=1\n\nAt t=1 (turn t_1+1): position y=1, action a_1 = D, to y=0 at t=2\n\nAt t=2 (turn t_1+2): position y=0, action a_2 = S, to y=0 at t=3\n\nAt t=3 (turn t_1+3): position y=0, action a_3 = S, to y=0 at t=4\n\nAt t=4 (turn t_1+4): position y=0, action a_4 = S, to y=0 at t=5\n\nAt t=5 (turn t_1+5): position y=0, action a_5 = U, to y=1 at t=6\n\nAt t=6 (turn t_1+6): position y=1, action a_6 = U, to y=2 at t=7\n\nAt t=7 (turn t_1+7): position y=2, action a_7 = U, to y=3 at t=8\n\nAt t=8 (turn t_1+8): position y=3, action a_8 = U, to y=4 at t=9\n\nAt t=9 (turn t_1+9): position y=4, action a_9 = U, to y=5 at t=10\n\nAt t=10 (turn t_1+10): position y=5, action a_10 = U, to y=6 at t=11\n\nAt t=11 (turn t_1+11): position y=6, action a_11 = U, to y=7 at t=12\n\nAt t=12 (turn t_1+12): position y=7, action a_12 = U, to y=8 at t=13\n\nAt t=13 (turn t_1+13): position y=8, action a_13 = U, to y=9 at t=14\n\nAt t=14 (turn t_1+14): position y=9, which is the goal.\n\nNow, we reached at turn t_1 +14, so H=14 actions.\n\nBut is this minimal? We spent 5 turns at y=0 from t=2 to t=5, but we could reduce that.\n\nIn this case, we used 14 turns to go from y=0 to y=9.\n\nBut minimal is 9, but we had to wait.\n\nSince y=6 is always safe, we could go to y=6 earlier and wait there.\n\nBut to go to y=6, we need 6 steps.\n\nEarliest at t=6, y=6.\n\nBut at t=6, if we are at y=6, then we can stay there until after the unsafe periods, but the unsafe periods for low y are at τ=3,4,5, which are t=3,4,5, and for high y, only at τ=2 for y=5,7,8, which is t=2.\n\nBut at t=2, if we are on y=6, safe.\n\nSo let's try to go directly to y=6 as fast as possible.\n\nStart at t=0, y=0, action U to y=1 at t=1\n\nt=1, y=1, action U to y=2 at t=2\n\nAt t=2, y=2, τ=2, y=2 is safe at τ=2? y=2 unsafe at τ=3,4,5,12,13,14, so at τ=2 safe.\n\nNow, action U to y=3 at t=3\n\nAt t=3, y=3, τ=3, safe (unsafe at τ=4,5)\n\nNow, at t=3, y=3, I need to go to y=4, but at t=4, if I go U to y=4, then at t=4, y=4, τ=4, unsafe.\n\nProblem.\n\nFrom y=3 at t=3, I could go down or stay, but both lead to unsafe at t=4.\n\nUnless I go to y=6 directly, but I can't.\n\nPerhaps at t=2, instead of going to y=3, I can stay or something.\n\nAt t=2, y=2, I can stay at y=2 at t=3, but at τ=3, y=2 unsafe.\n\nOr go down to y=1 at t=3, unsafe.\n\nSo only up to y=3 is possible, but stuck.\n\nTherefore, the only way is to avoid the area during τ=4 and5 by being at y=0.\n\nIn the first approach, we used 14 turns, but we can reduce the waiting time.\n\nIn the first path, we were at y=0 from t=2 to t=5, that's positions at t=2,3,4,5 all y=0.\n\nBut at t=1, we were at y=1, then down to y=0 at t=2.\n\nWe could go up to y=1 earlier or later.\n\nSince the unsafe period is only τ=4 and5 for the critical part, and we need to be at y=0 during that time.\n\nWe can be at other safe positions, but as we saw, we can't reach high y early.\n\nMinimal time: we need to reach y=9.\n\nThe delay is due to waiting during τ=4 and5.\n\nAfter τ=5, we can go up directly, as in the first path from t=6 to t=14, but from t=6 y=1 to t=14 y=9, that's 8 steps for 8 levels? From y=1 to y=9, difference 8, so 8 steps if all up.\n\nIn the path: from t=6 y=1 to t=7 y=2, t=8 y=3, t=9 y=4, t=10 y=5, t=11 y=6, t=12 y=7, t=13 y=8, t=14 y=9, yes 8 steps from y=1 to y=9.\n\nBut we started from y=0 at t=5, went to y=1 at t=6.\n\nNow, to minimize, we should minimize the time before we start going up.\n\nIn the first part, from t=0 to t=5: we went to y=1 at t=1, down to y=0 at t=2, then stayed until t=5.\n\nBut we could start later.\n\nFor example, at t=0, stay at y=0: action S, to y=0 at t=1\n\nThen at t=1, stay or go up.\n\nBut if I go up at t=1 to y=1 at t=2, then at t=2, y=1, I need to handle.\n\nAt t=2, y=1, τ=2, safe.\n\nThen I can go to y=2 at t=3, but at τ=3, y=2 unsafe.\n\nGo down to y=0 at t=3, safe.\n\nThen at t=3, y=0, I can stay for τ=4 and5.\n\nBut at t=3, y=0, stay to t=4, then stay to t=5.\n\nSame as before.\n\nAt t=0, I can stay multiple times.\n\nBut to reach y=0 at t=3,4,5.\n\nI need to be at y=0 at t=3,4,5.\n\nTo be at y=0 at t=3, I can come from below or stay.\n\nFor example:\n\nOption: at t=0, action S: to y=0 at t=1\n\nAt t=1, action S: to y=0 at t=2\n\nAt t=2, action S: to y=0 at t=3\n\nAt t=3, action S: to y=0 at t=4\n\nAt t=4, action S: to y=0 at t=5\n\nThen at t=5, action U: to y=1 at t=6\n\nSame as before, but I started with stay, so I was at y=0 from t=1 to t=5, which is longer? No.\n\nIn this case: at t=0: y=0, S to y=0 at t=1\n\nt=1: y=0, S to y=0 at t=2\n\nt=2: y=0, S to y=0 at t=3\n\nt=3: y=0, S to y=0 at t=4\n\nt=4: y=0, S to y=0 at t=5\n\nt=5: y=0, U to y=1 at t=6\n\nThen same as before from t=6.\n\nBut here, from t=1 to t=5, I am at y=0, but at t=0 I was also at y=0, so I wasted t=0 staying.\n\nIn the first path, at t=0 I went to y=1, then back, so at t=1 I was at y=1, not staying.\n\nBut in terms of reaching y=9, in first path at t=14 y=9, here at t=5 y=0, then U at t=5 to y=1 at t=6, then to y=9 at t=14, same as before.\n\nt=14 position.\n\nBut in this second way, I used an extra stay at beginning.\n\nIn first way: actions: t=0:U, t=1:D, t=2:S, t=3:S, t=4:S, t=5:U, then U every to t=13:U to y=9 at t=14.\n\nNumber of actions to reach y=9 at t=14: 14 actions.\n\nIn second way: t=0:S, t=1:S, t=2:S, t=3:S, t=4:S, t=5:U, t=6:U, ..., t=13:U to y=9 at t=14, same 14 actions, but I have more S actions.\n\nBut H is the number of actions, same.\n\nCan I reach earlier?\n\nFor example, can I be at y=9 before t=14?\n\nSuppose I start going up immediately after τ=5.\n\nAt t=5, I am at y=0.\n\nIf I go up every turn from t=5.\n\nt=5: y=0, U to y=1 at t=6\n\nt=6: y=1, U to y=2 at t=7\n\n...\n\nup to t=13: U to y=8 at t=13? Let's see:\n\nAfter actions:\n\nStart t=0: y=0\n\nBut we need to reach t=5 at y=0.\n\nEarliest: suppose I go to y=1 and back quickly.\n\nAt t=0: U to y=1 at t=1\n\nt=1: D to y=0 at t=2\n\nt=2: S to y=0 at t=3\n\nt=3: S to y=0 at t=4\n\nt=4: S to y=0 at t=5\n\nt=5: U to y=1 at t=6\n\nt=6: U to y=2 at t=7\n\nt=7: U to y=3 at t=8\n\nt=8: U to y=4 at t=9\n\nt=9: U to y=5 at t=10\n\nt=10: U to y=6 at t=11\n\nt=11: U to y=7 at t=12\n\nt=12: U to y=8 at t=13\n\nt=13: U to y=9 at t=14\n\nSame as before.\n\nFrom t=5 y=0, to y=9 at t=14, 9 steps? From t=5 to t=14, that's 9 actions to go from y=0 to y=9, which is minimal, but we have the waiting before.\n\nIn this case, we have 5 actions to set up to t=5 at y=0, but with U and D, we used 2 actions to go to y=1 and back, then 3 S to stay until t=5.\n\nTotal actions 14.\n\nBut the minimal possible: since we must spend at least 5 turns from start to t=5, and at t=5 we are at y=0, then 9 turns to y=9, so min H=14, I think.\n\nBut at t=5, if I were at higher y, but I can't be.\n\nSuppose I go to y=6 quickly after τ=5.\n\nBut I need to reach y=6.\n\nFor example, if I can be at y=6 at t=6, then I can go up.\n\nBut to be at y=6 at t=6, I need to go up 6 times in 6 turns, but from t=0 to t=6.\n\nBut at t=4, I need to be on y=4 or something, but unsafe.\n\nFor instance: at t=0: U to y=1 at t=1\n\nt=1: U to y=2 at t=2\n\nt=2: U to y=3 at t=3\n\nAt t=3, y=3, I cannot go to y=4 at t=4 because unsafe.\n\nIf I stay at y=3 at t=4, unsafe.\n\nSo impossible to be at y=4 or above at t=4.\n\nSimilarly, at t=5, I can be at y=5, but y=5 at t=5, τ=5, y=5 is safe at τ=5, since unsafe only at τ=2.\n\ny=5 unsafe only τ=2, so at τ=5 safe.\n\nBut to reach y=5 at t=5, I need to go up 5 times in 5 turns.\n\nAt t=0: U to y=1 at t=1\n\nt=1: U to y=2 at t=2\n\nt=2: U to y=3 at t=3\n\nAt t=3, y=3, now at τ=3, safe.\n\nThen I want to go to y=4 at t=4, but at τ=4, y=4 unsafe.\n\nCannot.\n\nGo to y=5? But from y=3, I can only go to y=2,3,4 at t=4.\n\ny=4 unsafe, y=3 unsafe at τ=4, y=2 unsafe at τ=4.\n\nSo no, cannot be at y=5 at t=4 or t=5 directly.\n\nThus, it is impossible to be above y=0 at t=4 and t=5 without collision.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 14, with the path as above.\n\nNow, in the path, we have actions.\n\nBut in the sequence, we need to output for turn t_1 and onwards.\n\nt_1=9.\n\nActions from turn t_1 to t_1 + H -1, I think.\n\nIn the answer format: Turn t_1: a_{t_1}, Turn t_1+1: a_{t_1+1}, ..., up to the last action before reaching.\n\nIn the sequence, after H actions, at turn t_1 + H, position is 9.\n\nThe actions are for turns t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nFor example, in our path:\n\nAt turn t_1 +0: position y=0, action a_{t_1} (which is for turn t_1)\n\nIn the notation, the action at turn t is a_t, which determines the move to next position.\n\nSo for turn t, action a_t, then position at turn t+1 is updated.\n\nIn the answer, we need to list actions for turns starting from t_1.\n\nIn our case, t_1=9.\n\nFrom above:\n\nTurn 9 (t_1): action U  (to y=1 at turn 10)\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nTurn t_1=9: action a_{t_1} = U\n\nThen position at turn 10: y=1\n\nTurn 10: action a_{t_1 +1} = D? In my first sequence:\n\nAt offset t=0 (turn 9): action a_0 = U\n\nt=1 (turn 10): action a_1 = D\n\nt=2 (turn 11): action a_2 = S\n\nt=3 (turn 12): action a_3 = S\n\nt=4 (turn 13): action a_4 = S\n\nt=5 (turn 14): action a_5 = U\n\nt=6 (turn 15): action a_6 = U\n\nt=7 (turn 16): action a_7 = U\n\nt=8 (turn 17): action a_8 = U\n\nt=9 (turn 18): action a_9 = U\n\nt=10 (turn 19): action a_10 = U\n\nt=11 (turn 20): action a_11 = U\n\nt=12 (turn 21): action a_12 = U\n\nt=13 (turn 22): action a_13 = U to y=9 at turn 23\n\nAt turn 23, position y=9.\n\nH=14 actions, from turn 9 to turn 22.\n\nActions for turn 9 to turn 22.\n\nNow, but we have the later unsafe times at τ=12,13,14 for y=1 and2, but in this path, at τ=12, which is t=12, turn t_1 +12=9+12=21, we are at y=7, which is fine.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nBut in the sequence, at turn 10, we go down to y=0, but y=0 is safe.\n\nNow, is there a shorter path?\n\nSuppose I go to y=6 faster after waiting.\n\nFor example, after being at y=0 at t=5, I go up, but to y=6 directly if possible, but step by step.\n\nIn the path, from t=5 y=0 to t=11 y=6, that's 6 steps to go to y=6.\n\nSince y=6 is safe, I can stay there, but no need, I can go up.\n\nBut in this case, I reached y=9 at t=14.\n\nPerhaps I can start going up earlier, but I have to avoid τ=4,5.\n\nAnother idea: at τ=5, I can be at y=5, which is safe.\n\nBut to be at y=5 at τ=5, I need to reach there.\n\nFor example, from start, if I can be at y=5 at t=5.\n\nBut to be at y=5 at t=5, I need to go up 5 times in 5 turns.\n\nBut at t=4, I must be at y=4 or y=5, but at τ=4, y=4 unsafe, and y=5: at τ=4, y=5 safe, since unsafe only τ=2.\n\nBut to be at y=5 at t=5, at t=4 I must be at y=4 or y=5 and go up or stay.\n\nBut at t=4, position y, then action to y at t=5.\n\nIf at t=4, I am at y=4, and I go U to y=5 at t=5.\n\nBut at t=4, y=4, τ=4, which is unsafe, collision.\n\nIf at t=4, I am at y=5, and I stay to y=5 at t=5.\n\nBut to be at y=5 at t=4, I need to reach earlier.\n\nAt t=3, I can be at y=3, then go U to y=4 at t=4, but y=4 unsafe at τ=4.\n\nOr to y=5, cannot directly.\n\nSo impossible to be at y=5 at t=4 or t=5 without being on unsafe position earlier.\n\nTherefore, the only safe way is to be at y=0 during τ=4 and5, and proceed after.\n\nThus H=14 is minimal.\n\nNow, in the sequence, we have to list the actions.\n\nBut in the car state, there is freeway 6 with one car, but we said it is always safe, and in the path we passed through.\n\nAlso, the answer should be in the box.\n\nBut let's write the actions for each turn.\n\nTurn t_1 =9: action U\n\nTurn 10: action D (since we go down to y=0)\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nTurn 9: U  (to y=1 at turn 10)\n\nTurn 10: D  (to y=0 at turn 11)\n\nThen we stay at y=0 for turns 11,12,13? Turns:\n\nAfter action at turn 10: position at turn 11 is y=0\n\nThen action at turn 11: S (stay, to y=0 at turn 12)\n\nAction at turn 12: S (to y=0 at turn 13)\n\nAction at turn 13: S (to y=0 at turn 14)\n\nIn my earlier, at t=2,3,4: actions S to stay at y=0.\n\nt=2: offset, turn t_1+2=11, position y=0, action S to y=0 at turn 12\n\nThen turn 12: position y=0, action S to y=0 at turn 13\n\nTurn 13: position y=0, action S to y=0 at turn 14\n\nTurn 14: position y=0, action U to y=1 at turn 15\n\nTurn 15: position y=1, action U to y=2 at turn 16\n\n...\n\nUp to:\n\nTurn 21: position y=7, action U to y=8 at turn 22\n\nTurn 22: position y=8, action U to y=9 at turn 23\n\nWe need to reach at turn t_1 + H, y=9.\n\nIn this case, at turn 23, y=9.\n\nH=14 actions from turn 9 to 22.\n\nNow, the sequence of actions:\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: D\n\nTurn 11: S\n\nTurn 12: S\n\nTurn 13: S  (this is for turn 13, to position at turn 14)\n\nIn the action list:\n\nFor turn 9: a_{9} = U\n\nTurn 10: a_{10} = D\n\nTurn 11: a_{11} = S  (since at turn 11, position y=0, action S to stay)\n\nTurn 12: a_{12} = S\n\nTurn 13: a_{13} = S\n\nThen turn 14: a_{14} = U\n\nTurn 15: a_{15} = U\n\nTurn 16: a_{16} = U\n\nTurn 17: a_{17} = U\n\nTurn 18: a_{18} = U\n\nTurn 19: a_{19} = U\n\nTurn 20: a_{20} = U\n\nTurn 21: a_{21} = U\n\nTurn 22: a_{22} = U\n\nNow, at turn 23, position y=9.\n\nBut in the sequence, we have actions from turn 9 to turn 22.\n\nThe last action is at turn 22, U to y=9 at turn 23.\n\nNow, to write in the answer.\n\nBut in the initial part, we used D to go down, but is it necessary? In this case, we went to y=1 and back, but we could just stay from the beginning.\n\nFor example:\n\nTurn 9: S (to y=0 at turn 10)\n\nTurn 10: S (to y=0 at turn 11)\n\nTurn 11: S (to y=0 at turn 12)\n\nTurn 12: S (to y=0 at turn 13)\n\nTurn 13: S (to y=0 at turn 14)\n\nTurn 14: U (to y=1 at turn 15)\n\nThen same as before: U every turn to turn 22: U to y=9 at turn 23.\n\nActions: turn 14 to turn 22, but turn 14 U to y=1 at 15, turn 15 U to y=2 at 16, ..., turn 22 U to y=9 at 23.\n\nNumber of actions: from turn 9 to 22, still 14 actions.\n\nBut in this case, we have 5 S at the beginning, then 9 U.\n\nIn the first way, we had U, D, then S,S,S, then U... so one extra action, but H same.\n\nBut in terms of the game, both are fine.\n\nI think with the down action, it might be slightly faster in terms of when we start, but same H.\n\nNow, about the cars: in freeway 6, there is one car, but we said always safe, no issue.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nBut in the sequence, when we go up, at turn 20, for example, position y=6 at turn 20, τ=t-9? Turn 20, t_1=9, so τ=11, y=6 safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nSo minimal H=14.\n\nNow, to output:\n\nThe sequence of actions from turn t_1=9.\n\nIn the first sequence:\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: D\n\nTurn 11: S\n\nTurn 12: S\n\nTurn 13: S\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nTurn 20: U\n\nTurn 21: U\n\nTurn 22: U\n\nIn the answer format:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 9: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: D \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 14: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 15: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 16: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 17: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 18: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 19: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 20: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 21: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 22: U \\end{array} }\n\nBut let's confirm the turns.\n\nAfter action at turn 22, position at turn 23 is y=9, which is the goal.\n\nAnd we avoided all collisions.\n\nSince y=6 is safe, but we didn't need to stay, we passed through.\n\nI think this is correct.\n</think>\nTo reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 0) at turn \\(t_1 = 9\\) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the player must follow a sequence of actions that accounts for the unsafe times on each freeway. The unsafe times, derived from the car states and their movements, are as follows:\n\n- Freeway 1: Unsafe at turns \\(t_1 + 3 = 12\\), \\(t_1 + 4 = 13\\), \\(t_1 + 5 = 14\\), \\(t_1 + 12 = 21\\), \\(t_1 + 13 = 22\\), \\(t_1 + 14 = 23\\)\n- Freeway 2: Unsafe at turns 12, 13, 14, 21, 22, 23\n- Freeway 3: Unsafe at turns 13, 14\n- Freeway 4: Unsafe at turns 13, 14\n- Freeway 5: Unsafe at turn \\(t_1 + 2 = 11\\)\n- Freeway 6: Always safe\n- Freeway 7: Unsafe at turn 11\n- Freeway 8: Unsafe at turn 11\n\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\(y = 9\\) is 14, achieved by the following sequence of actions:\n\n- At turn 9, the player is at \\(y = 0\\) and moves up to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 10 (safe, as \\(y = 1\\) is safe at turn 10).\n- At turn 10, the player is at \\(y = 1\\) and moves down to \\(y = 0\\) at turn 11 to avoid being on unsafe freeways during critical turns.\n- From turns 11 to 13, the player stays at \\(y = 0\\) (safe) to avoid the unsafe period for freeways 1-4 at turns 12-14.\n- Starting from turn 14, the player moves up continuously to \\(y = 9\\), as all freeways are safe during these turns:\n  - At turn 14, move to \\(y = 1\\) (safe at turn 15).\n  - At turn 15, move to \\(y = 2\\) (safe at turn 16).\n  - At turn 16, move to \\(y = 3\\) (safe at turn 17).\n  - At turn 17, move to \\(y = 4\\) (safe at turn 18).\n  - At turn 18, move to \\(y = 5\\) (safe at turn 19).\n  - At turn 19, move to \\(y = 6\\) (always safe at turn 20).\n  - At turn 20, move to \\(y = 7\\) (safe at turn 21).\n  - At turn 21, move to \\(y = 8\\) (safe at turn 22).\n  - At turn 22, move to \\(y = 9\\) (safe at turn 23).\n\nThis sequence ensures no collisions and reaches \\(y = 9\\) in 14 turns (from turn 9 to turn 22, with position achieved at turn 23).\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 9: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: D \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 14: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 15: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 16: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 17: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 18: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 19: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 20: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 21: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 22: U \\end{array} }",

We need to reach (0,9) in minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways 1 to 8 (y=1 to y=8). \n\nImportant: The player moves vertically (y-direction) and the cars move horizontally (x-direction). The player is at x=0 at every turn. Collision occurs at turn T if the player is on a freeway k (so y_T = k) and at the same time, the car on that freeway k has a span that includes 0 at turn T.\n\nNote: The player's position at turn T is (0, y_T). When the player moves, they update their y at the next turn. Specifically, if at turn T the player is at y_T and takes action a_T, then at turn T+1 they will be at:\n  - If a_T = U: y_{T+1} = y_T + 1\n  - If a_T = D: y_{T+1} = y_T - 1\n  - If a_T = S: y_{T+1} = y_T\n\nBut note: when moving (changing freeway), at the moment of turn T, the player is still on the current freeway y_T. So if moving up at turn T, then at turn T the player is on y_T, and at turn T+1 the player is on y_T+1.\n\nCollision condition: At turn T, if the player is on freeway k (so y_T = k), then we must check the car(s) on freeway k at turn T. The car spans are given at the initial turn (t1=12) and we can compute their positions at any future turn T.\n\nFor a car on freeway k at turn t1=12 with (head, tail, direction, speed) = (h, τ, d, s):\n  - If direction is 'right', then the car is moving to the right. At turn T (>=t1), the car's head and tail are:\n        head(T) = h + s*(T - t1)\n        tail(T) = τ + s*(T - t1)\n    and the span is [tail(T), head(T)] (since head>tail for right-moving? Actually the given example: for right-moving, at t1=12: (24,13,right,4) -> head=24, tail=13 -> so the car occupies [13,24] at t1=12? But note the example: \"Right-moving: [Span(t1)=[τ, h] -> Span(T)=[τ + s(T-t1), h+s(T-t1)]\". So in the example, for the first car on freeway1: (-48, -59, right, 4) -> at t1=12, the span is [τ, h] = [-59, -48] (so tail=-59, head=-48). Then at a future turn T, it becomes [-59+4*(T-12), -48+4*(T-12)].\n\n  - If direction is 'left', then head(T)=h - s*(T-t1), tail(T)=τ - s*(T-t1), and the span is [head(T), tail(T)]? But note the left-moving example: \"Left-moving: Span(t1)=[h, τ] -> Span(T)=[h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\". So for left-moving, the head is the larger coordinate? Actually, the example doesn't have left-moving cars. But in the problem, all cars in the current state are right-moving.\n\nAll cars in the given state are right-moving. So for each car, at turn T, the span is:\n   [τ + s*(T-12), h + s*(T-12)]\n\nWe note that the span is an interval. The player at (0, y_T) will collide at turn T if y_T is the freeway of that car and 0 is in the interval [τ + s*(T-12), h + s*(T-12)].\n\nBut note: the freeway k is fixed for each car. The player is only on one freeway at a time. So at turn T, if the player is at freeway k, then we must check every car on freeway k (as given in the table) at turn T.\n\nWe start at turn 12 at y=0. We cannot collide at turn 12 because we are at y=0, and the freeways with cars are y=1 to 8. So we are safe at turn12.\n\nWe need to go from y=0 to y=9. The minimal number of turns without any cars would be 9 moves up (H=9). But we have to avoid cars.\n\nWe must plan a sequence of actions (U, D, S) for turns 12, 13, 14, ... until we reach y=9.\n\nWe are allowed to move down (if above 0) or stay. But our goal is to minimize H, so we want to go up as much as possible, but we have to avoid collisions.\n\nLet's denote T = turn number (starting at T=12).\n\nWe will simulate the future positions of the cars. For each freeway k (1 to 8) and for each car on that freeway, we can compute the interval [L, R] at turn T as:\n   L(T) = τ + s*(T-12)\n   R(T) = h + s*(T-12)\n\nBut note: for a right-moving car, the head is the rightmost? Actually, the given data: for a car (head, tail, direction, speed). For right-moving, the head is the front? So at time T, the car extends from tail(T) to head(T), and tail(T) <= head(T). So the interval is [tail(T), head(T)] = [τ+s*(T-12), h+s*(T-12)].\n\nWe must check for each freeway k and each car on k: at turn T, if the player is on k (y_T = k) and if 0 is in [τ+s*(T-12), h+s*(T-12)].\n\nWe note: the player must not be on a freeway k at a turn T when any car on k has a span that includes 0.\n\nWe are going to simulate from T=12 (current) to the future. We start at (0,0) at T=12.\n\nWe have to get to y=9. The minimal H is 9 (if we go up every turn). But we must check if that path is safe.\n\nPath: T=12: y=0 -> safe (no car on freeway0? Actually freeways are 1-8, and we are at 0 -> safe)\nT=13: take U -> y=1 -> now we are on freeway1 at T=13.\n\nCheck freeway1 at T=13: \n  Cars on freeway1: \n      car1: (-48, -59, right, 4) -> at T=13: \n          L = -59 + 4*(13-12) = -59+4 = -55\n          R = -48 + 4 = -44 -> interval [-55, -44] -> 0 is not in this interval.\n      car2: (-12, -23, right, 4) -> L = -23+4 = -19, R = -12+4 = -8 -> [-19,-8] -> no 0.\n      car3: (24,13,right,4) -> L=13+4=17, R=24+4=28 -> [17,28] -> no 0.\n  So safe.\n\nT=14: take U -> y=2 -> freeway2 at T=14.\n  Cars on freeway2: same as freeway1? The table says freeway2 has the same cars as freeway1? \n      car1: (-48,-59,right,4) -> T=14: L=-59+4*2=-51, R=-48+8=-40 -> [-51,-40] -> no 0.\n      car2: (-12,-23,right,4) -> L=-23+8=-15, R=-12+8=-4 -> [-15,-4] -> no 0.\n      car3: (24,13,right,4) -> L=13+8=21, R=24+8=32 -> [21,32] -> no 0.\n  Safe.\n\nT=15: take U -> y=3 -> freeway3 at T=15.\n  Cars on freeway3: \n      (48,37,right,6), (12,1,right,6), (-24,-35,right,6)\n  For each at T=15 (which is 3 turns after t1=12, so T-12=3):\n      car1: 37+6*3=37+18=55, 48+18=66 -> [55,66] -> no 0.\n      car2: 1+18=19, 12+18=30 -> [19,30] -> no 0.\n      car3: -35+18=-17, -24+18=-6 -> [-17,-6] -> no 0.\n  Safe.\n\nT=16: take U -> y=4 -> freeway4 at T=16.\n  Cars on freeway4: same as freeway3? \n      car1: 37+6*4=37+24=61, 48+24=72 -> [61,72] -> no 0.\n      car2: 1+24=25, 12+24=36 -> [25,36] -> no 0.\n      car3: -35+24=-11, -24+24=0 -> [-11,0] -> 0 is included? \n          The interval is [tail, head] = [-11,0]. So 0 is the head? The problem says the car span includes the endpoints? \n          Collision occurs if 0 is in the span. Since 0 is the endpoint, it is included -> collision.\n\nSo if we go straight up, at T=16 we would collide on freeway4 with the third car (which is at [-11,0] at T=16).\n\nTherefore, we cannot go straight up on turn15 (which leads to T=16 at y=4).\n\nWe must avoid being at freeway4 at T=16.\n\nOptions:\n  - We could delay going to freeway4. For example, at T=15 (when we are at y=3) we could stay (S) or go down (D) to avoid being at y=4 at T=16. But then we have to go up later.\n\nAlternatively, we might go up at a different time.\n\nWe note that the cars move continuously. We need to check for every step.\n\nLet me write a function to check for a given freeway k and turn T, if there is a collision.\n\nBut note: the freeway k at turn T: we have to check every car on that freeway.\n\nWe are going to simulate a BFS or a state-space search. However, since we want minimal H, and the y-coordinate is bounded (0 to 9), and H is not too large, we can try to compute the minimal path.\n\nWe'll consider states (t, y) where t is the turn number and y is the current y-coordinate. We start at (12,0). We want to reach (t,9) for some t.\n\nAt each state (t,y), we can choose an action a in {U, D, S} that leads to:\n  - If a=U: (t+1, y+1) [if y+1<=9]\n  - If a=D: (t+1, y-1) [if y-1>=0]\n  - If a=S: (t+1, y)\n\nBut we must check that at the current turn t, if we are at freeway y, we are not colliding? Actually, the collision check is done at the turn when we are at that freeway. \n\nImportant: at the moment of turn t, we are at (0, y). So we must check at turn t, for freeway y, if there is a car that has 0 in its span at turn t.\n\nBut note: we started at turn12 at y=0 -> safe. Then at turn13 we are at y=1 -> then we check freeway1 at turn13.\n\nSo the state (t,y) is safe if at turn t, if y is between 1 and 8, then none of the cars on freeway y has a span that includes 0 at turn t. If y=0 or y=9, there are no cars (freeways 1-8 have cars) so they are safe.\n\nSo we can simulate:\n\nWe want to minimize the number of turns from t=12. So we can do a BFS by increasing t.\n\nLet me list the cars per freeway:\n\nFreeway1: three cars: \n  car1: h=-48, τ=-59, d=right, s=4 -> at turn T: [ -59+4*(T-12), -48+4*(T-12) ]\n  car2: h=-12, τ=-23, d=right, s=4 -> [ -23+4*(T-12), -12+4*(T-12) ]\n  car3: h=24, τ=13, d=right, s=4 -> [ 13+4*(T-12), 24+4*(T-12) ]\n\nFreeway2: same as freeway1? The table says:\n  | 2 | (-48,-59,right,4), (-12,-23,right,4), (24,13,right,4) |\n  So identical to freeway1.\n\nFreeway3: \n  car1: h=48, τ=37, d=right, s=6 -> [37+6*(T-12), 48+6*(T-12)]\n  car2: h=12, τ=1, d=right, s=6 -> [1+6*(T-12), 12+6*(T-12)]\n  car3: h=-24, τ=-35, d=right, s=6 -> [-35+6*(T-12), -24+6*(T-12)]\n\nFreeway4: same as freeway3? \n  | 4 | (48,37,right,6), (12,1,right,6), (-24,-35,right,6) |\n  So identical to freeway3.\n\nFreeway5: \n  | 5 | (48,37,right,12), (12,1,right,12), (-24,-35,right,12) |\n  So same cars but speed=12.\n\nFreeway6: \n  | 6 | (48,37,right,3) | -> only one car: [37+3*(T-12), 48+3*(T-12)]\n\nFreeway7: \n  | 7 | (-48,-71,right,24) | -> [-71+24*(T-12), -48+24*(T-12)]\n\nFreeway8: same as freeway7? \n  | 8 | (-48,-71,right,24) | -> same as freeway7.\n\nWe are going to simulate the states from t=12 onward.\n\nWe note that the cars move and the intervals change. We must compute for each freeway k and for each turn T the intervals of the cars on k.\n\nWe are only concerned with T>=12.\n\nWe are going to try to find a path that reaches y=9 in minimal turns.\n\nWe'll try the naive path first (always U) and see where it fails.\n\nWe already saw:\n  T=12: y=0 -> safe\n  T=13: y=1 -> safe (as computed)\n  T=14: y=2 -> safe\n  T=15: y=3 -> safe\n  T=16: y=4 -> collision? \n        freeway4 at T=16: \n          car1: [37+6*(16-12)=37+24=61, 48+24=72] -> [61,72] -> no 0.\n          car2: [1+24=25, 12+24=36] -> [25,36] -> no 0.\n          car3: [-35+24=-11, -24+24=0] -> [-11,0] -> 0 is included -> collision.\n\nSo we must avoid being at freeway4 at T=16.\n\nHow about we wait at y=3 for one turn? Then:\n  T=15: at y=3 -> safe (as above)\n  Then at T=15 we choose S -> so at T=16 we are still at y=3.\n      Check freeway3 at T=16: \n          freeway3: \n            car1: [37+6*(16-12)=37+24=61, 48+24=72] -> safe\n            car2: [1+24=25,12+24=36] -> safe\n            car3: [-35+24=-11, -24+24=0] -> [-11,0] -> 0 is included -> collision? \n          But wait, freeway3: the car3 at T=16: [-11,0] -> 0 is included -> so if we are at freeway3 at T=16, we collide.\n\nSo staying at y=3 at T=16 is also unsafe.\n\nWhat about moving down? \n  At T=15: we are at y=3. Instead of going up to y=4 (which we know crashes) or staying (which we see crashes at T=16 at y=3), we could move down to y=2 at T=16.\n  Then at T=16: we are at y=2 -> freeway2.\n\n  Check freeway2 at T=16: \n      cars: same as freeway1 and freeway2 are identical to freeway1? \n      car1: [-59+4*(16-12)= -59+16=-43, -48+16=-32] -> [-43,-32] -> safe\n      car2: [-23+16=-7, -12+16=4] -> [-7,4] -> 0 is in [-7,4]? Yes -> collision.\n\nSo moving down to y=2 at T=16 is also unsafe.\n\nTherefore, we must avoid being at freeway2,3,4 at T=16.\n\nWhat about going to freeway5? But we are at y=3 at T=15. To get to y=5 we would need to go up twice. But we can only do one action per turn.\n\nSo at T=15 we are at y=3. We cannot get to y=5 in one step.\n\nAlternatively, we might have taken a different path earlier.\n\nFor example, at T=14 (when we were at y=2), instead of going up to y=3 at T=15, we could have done something else.\n\nBut we are trying to minimize H, so we want to go up as much as possible. But we see that at T=16 we have a problem at freeways 2,3,4.\n\nWe must avoid being at freeways 2,3,4 at T=16.\n\nSo at T=16 we should be at y=0,1,5,6,7,8, or 9.\n\nBut we are at y=3 at T=15. We can only move one step. So at T=16 we can be at y=2,3,4. We already saw all are unsafe.\n\nTherefore, we must avoid being at freeway3 at T=15? \n\nBut we were at freeway3 at T=15 and that was safe. The problem is at T=16.\n\nAlternatively, we can delay our progress earlier. For example, at T=13 (when we were at y=1) we could have stayed or moved down? But moving down to y=0 is safe, but then we are not making progress.\n\nOr at T=14 we could have stayed at y=2.\n\nLet me check T=16 at freeway2,3,4:\n\nFreeway2 at T=16: \n  car2: [-23+4*4 = -23+16 = -7, -12+16=4] -> [-7,4] -> 0 is in [-7,4] -> collision.\n\nFreeway3 at T=16: \n  car3: [-35+6*4 = -35+24=-11, -24+24=0] -> [-11,0] -> collision.\n\nFreeway4 at T=16: same as freeway3? Actually freeway4 has the same cars as freeway3 -> same collision.\n\nBut what about freeway1? \n  At T=16: \n      car1: [-59+4*4=-59+16=-43, -48+16=-32] -> no 0.\n      car2: [-23+16=-7, -12+16=4] -> 0 is in [-7,4] -> collision.\n\nSo freeway1 is also unsafe at T=16.\n\nAnd freeway5? \n  Freeway5: cars at T=16 (T-12=4):\n      car1: [37+12*4=37+48=85, 48+48=96] -> safe\n      car2: [1+48=49, 12+48=60] -> safe\n      car3: [-35+48=13, -24+48=24] -> [13,24] -> safe? 0 not in [13,24] -> safe.\n\nSo freeway5 is safe at T=16.\n\nSimilarly, freeway6: \n  Only one car: [37+3*4=37+12=49, 48+12=60] -> safe.\n\nFreeway7: \n  [-71+24*4 = -71+96=25, -48+96=48] -> [25,48] -> safe.\n\nFreeway8: same as freeway7 -> safe.\n\nSo at T=16, the safe freeways are 0,5,6,7,8,9.\n\nBut we are at T=15 at y=3. How can we be at y=5 or above at T=16? That requires being at y=4 at T=15 and then moving up? But we were at y=3 at T=15. We cannot jump two.\n\nTherefore, we must have been at a higher y earlier? Or we must skip T=16 for the dangerous freeways.\n\nBut we cannot skip a turn. We have to be at one freeway at each turn.\n\nAlternative plan: we avoid reaching y=3 at T=15. How?\n\nAt T=14 we were at y=2. Instead of going up to y=3 at T=15, we could have stayed at y=2 at T=15.\n\nThen at T=15: we are at y=2 -> freeway2 at T=15.\n  Check freeway2 at T=15: \n      car1: [-59+4*3=-59+12=-47, -48+12=-36] -> safe.\n      car2: [-23+12=-11, -12+12=0] -> [-11,0] -> 0 is included -> collision.\n\nSo if we stay at y=2 at T=15, we collide.\n\nWhat if we move down at T=14? From y=2 at T=14, we move down to y=1 at T=15.\n  Then at T=15: y=1 -> freeway1 at T=15.\n      freeway1 at T=15: \n          car1: [-59+4*3=-47, -48+12=-36] -> safe.\n          car2: [-23+12=-11, -12+12=0] -> collision (0 in [-11,0]).\n\nSo also collision.\n\nTherefore, we must not be at freeway1 or freeway2 at T=15 either? \n\nCheck freeway1 at T=15: \n  car2: [-23+4*(15-12)= -23+12=-11, -12+12=0] -> collision.\n\nSimilarly freeway2: same.\n\nSo at T=15, freeway1 and freeway2 are unsafe.\n\nWhat about freeway3 at T=15: \n  We computed earlier: safe.\n\nFreeway4 at T=15: same as freeway3? \n  freeway4: \n      car1: [37+6*3=55, 48+18=66] -> safe.\n      car2: [1+18=19,12+18=30] -> safe.\n      car3: [-35+18=-17, -24+18=-6] -> safe.\n\nSo freeway4 at T=15 is safe.\n\nFreeway5 at T=15: \n  car3: [-35+12*3=-35+36=1, -24+36=12] -> [1,12] -> 0 not included -> safe.\n  car2: [1+36=37, 12+36=48] -> safe.\n  car1: [37+36=73, 48+36=84] -> safe.\n\nFreeway6: [37+3*3=46,48+9=57] -> safe.\n\nFreeway7: [-71+24*3=-71+72=1, -48+72=24] -> [1,24] -> safe.\n\nFreeway8: same.\n\nSo at T=15, the safe freeways are 3,4,5,6,7,8, and also 0 and 9? But we are at y=2 at T=14. We can go to y=3 (freeway3) or to y=1 (freeway1, unsafe) or stay at y=2 (freeway2, unsafe). So the only safe move from T=14 is to go to y=3.\n\nBut then at T=15 we are at y=3 (safe), but then at T=16 we are stuck because we can only move to y=2,3,4 and all are unsafe at T=16.\n\nWe must find a way to be at a safe freeway at T=16. The safe freeways at T=16 are y=0,5,6,7,8,9.\n\nWe are at T=15 at y=3. How can we be at y=5 at T=16? We can't.\n\nTherefore, we must have been at a higher y earlier. For example, at T=15 we could be at y=4? But we were at y=2 at T=14, then at T=15 we can only be at y=1,2,3.\n\nSo we must have taken a different path before T=14.\n\nLet's go back to T=13: we were at y=1. From there, we went to y=2 at T=14. But what if we went up twice? We can only do one action per turn.\n\nAlternatively, at T=13 we could have done something else? \n\nAt T=13: we are at y=1. We can choose:\n  U: y=2 at T=14\n  D: y=0 at T=14\n  S: y=1 at T=14\n\nWe already saw that if we go to y=2 at T=14, then we are forced to go to y=3 at T=15 and then stuck.\n\nWhat if at T=13 we choose to stay? Then at T=14 we are at y=1.\n\n  T=14: y=1 -> freeway1 at T=14.\n      freeway1 at T=14: \n          car1: [-59+4*2=-51, -48+8=-40] -> safe.\n          car2: [-23+8=-15, -12+8=-4] -> safe.\n          car3: [13+8=21,24+8=32] -> safe.\n      So safe.\n\nThen at T=14: we are at y=1. Now what? We can go up to y=2 at T=15.\n\n  T=15: y=2 -> freeway2 at T=15: \n      car2: [-23+4*3=-23+12=-11, -12+12=0] -> collision.\n\nSo that doesn't work.\n\nWhat if at T=14 (from y=1) we go up to y=2? That's the same as before.\n\nOr we could go down to y=0 at T=14? Then at T=14: y=0 -> safe.\n\nThen at T=14: we are at y=0. Then at T=15: we can go up to y=1.\n\n  T=15: y=1 -> freeway1 at T=15: collision (car2: [-11,0]).\n\nOr at T=15 from y=0 we can stay or go up to y=1 (unsafe) or down to y=0 (safe but not progressing).\n\nSo that doesn't help.\n\nTherefore, we need to spend more turns in the lower freeways or change our path to avoid the dangerous times.\n\nWe see that the problem is at T=15 and T=16 for freeways 1,2,3,4.\n\nLet me compute the collision intervals for each freeway.\n\nFor freeway1 and freeway2 (same cars):\n\n  car2: span at turn T: [ -23 + 4*(T-12), -12 + 4*(T-12) ]\n        = [4T-48-23, 4T-48-12] = [4T-71, 4T-60]\n  We want to know when 0 is in [4T-71, 4T-60]?\n        Solve: 4T-71 <= 0 <= 4T-60\n        => 4T <= 71  => T<=17.75\n        and 4T-60>=0 => T>=15\n        So T=15,16,17 are dangerous for car2 on freeway1 and freeway2.\n\n  car1: [4T-59-48? Wait: car1: [-59+4*(T-12), -48+4*(T-12)] = [4T-48-59, 4T-48-48] = [4T-107, 4T-96]\n        We need 4T-107<=0<=4T-96 -> \n            4T>=107 => T>=26.75, and 4T-96>=0 => T>=24 -> not in the near future.\n\n  car3: [13+4*(T-12), 24+4*(T-12)] = [4T-48+13,4T-48+24] = [4T-35,4T-24]\n        then 4T-35<=0<=4T-24 -> \n            0>=4T-35 => T<=8.75 -> not in our future.\n\nSo for freeway1 and freeway2, the only dangerous car is car2 at T=15,16,17.\n\nSimilarly, freeway3 and freeway4:\n\n  car3: [ -35 + 6*(T-12), -24+6*(T-12) ] = [6T-72-35, 6T-72-24] = [6T-107, 6T-96]\n        dangerous when 6T-107<=0<=6T-96 -> \n            6T>=107 => T>=17.833, and 6T-96>=0 => T>=16.\n        So T=16,17 are dangerous.\n\n  car2: [1+6*(T-12), 12+6*(T-12)] = [6T-72+1,6T-72+12] = [6T-71,6T-60]\n        dangerous: 6T-71<=0<=6T-60 -> \n            6T>=71 => T>=11.833, and 6T-60>=0 => T>=10 -> so T=12,13,... but wait at T=12: \n            [6*12-71=72-71=1, 72-60=12] -> [1,12] -> 0 not included? Actually 0<1 -> not included.\n            T=13: [78-71=7,78-60=18] -> no\n            T=14: [84-71=13,84-60=24] -> no\n            T=15: [90-71=19,90-60=30] -> no\n            T=16: [96-71=25,96-60=36] -> no\n            So not dangerous.\n\n  car1: [37+6*(T-12),48+6*(T-12)] = [6T-72+37,6T-72+48] = [6T-35,6T-24] -> positive for T>=12, so not dangerous.\n\nSo for freeway3 and freeway4, only car3 is dangerous at T=16 and T=17.\n\nFreeway5: \n  car3: [-35+12*(T-12), -24+12*(T-12)] = [12T-144-35,12T-144-24] = [12T-179,12T-168]\n        dangerous: 12T-179<=0<=12T-168 -> \n            12T>=179 => T>=14.916, so T>=15, and 12T-168>=0 => T>=14 -> so T=15,16,...\n        T=15: [12*15-179=180-179=1, 180-168=12] -> [1,12] -> 0 not included.\n        T=16: [192-179=13,192-168=24] -> safe.\n        So not dangerous in the near future.\n\n  car2: [1+12*(T-12),12+12*(T-12)] = [12T-144+1,12T-144+12] = [12T-143,12T-132] -> positive for T>=12, safe.\n\n  car1: [37+12*(T-12),48+12*(T-12)] = [12T-144+37,12T-144+48] = [12T-107,12T-96] -> positive, safe.\n\nSo freeway5 is safe for T>=12.\n\nFreeway6: \n  only car: [37+3*(T-12),48+3*(T-12)] = [3T-36+37,3T-36+48] = [3T+1,3T+12] -> positive, safe.\n\nFreeway7 and freeway8:\n  car: [-71+24*(T-12), -48+24*(T-12)] = [24T-288-71,24T-288-48] = [24T-359,24T-336]\n        dangerous: 24T-359<=0<=24T-336 -> \n            24T>=359 => T>=14.958, so T>=15, and 24T-336>=0 => T>=14 -> so T=15,16,...\n        T=15: [24*15-359=360-359=1, 360-336=24] -> [1,24] -> safe (0 not included)\n        T=16: [384-359=25,384-336=48] -> safe.\n\nSo freeway7 and freeway8 are safe for T>=12.\n\nSummary of danger times for freeways 1-8:\n\nFreeway1 and 2: dangerous at T=15,16,17 (because of car2)\nFreeway3 and 4: dangerous at T=16,17 (because of car3)\nFreeway5,6,7,8: safe at least until T=16,17.\n\nWe are at T=12, y=0.\n\nWe need to get to y=9. We must avoid being on freeway1 or 2 at T=15,16,17 and freeway3 or 4 at T=16,17.\n\nWe can try to be above freeway4 by T=16.\n\nFor example:\n\n  T=12: y=0 -> safe.\n  T=13: U -> y=1 (freeway1) -> at T=13, freeway1: safe (car2: [4*13-71=52-71=-19, 4*13-60=52-60=-8] -> not including 0)\n  T=14: U -> y=2 (freeway2) -> at T=14, freeway2: \n        car2: [4*14-71=56-71=-15, 56-60=-4] -> safe.\n  T=15: U -> y=3 (freeway3) -> at T=15, freeway3: safe (car3: [6*15-107=90-107=-17, 90-96=-6] -> safe)\n  T=16: U -> y=4 (freeway4) -> at T=16, freeway4: dangerous (car3: [6*16-107=96-107=-11, 96-96=0] -> collision)\n\nBut we know that.\n\nWe need to be at least at freeway5 by T=16.\n\nHow can we be at freeway5 at T=16? We must have been at freeway4 at T=15, but freeway4 at T=15 is safe. But how to get to freeway4 at T=15?\n\nFrom the start:\n  T=12: y=0\n  T=13: y=1\n  T=14: y=2\n  T=15: y=3 -> that's what we had.\n\nTo be at y=4 at T=15, we would have to have been at y=3 at T=14. But at T=13 we were at y=1, so to be at y=3 at T=14 we would have to move up twice in one turn? Impossible.\n\nTherefore, we cannot be at freeway5 at T=16 with a direct up move.\n\nWe must use more turns and possibly move down to wait.\n\nLet me try to stay at y=0 for one turn:\n\n  T=12: y=0 -> safe.\n  T=13: S -> y=0 -> safe.\n  T=14: U -> y=1 -> freeway1 at T=14: safe (as above)\n  T=15: U -> y=2 -> freeway2 at T=15: collision (car2: [4*15-71=60-71=-11, 60-60=0] -> collision)\n\nNot good.\n\nOr:\n\n  T=12: y=0\n  T=13: U -> y=1 -> safe.\n  T=14: S -> y=1 -> freeway1 at T=14: safe.\n  T=15: U -> y=2 -> collision.\n\nSame.\n\nOr:\n\n  T=12: y=0\n  T=13: U -> y=1\n  T14: U -> y2\n  T15: D -> from y2 to y1 at T16? \n        T15: at y2 (freeway2) -> collision at T15.\n\nWe must avoid freeway2 at T15.\n\nSo we cannot be on freeway2 at T15.\n\nSimilarly, freeway1 at T15 is also dangerous.\n\nSo at T15, we must be at y=0,3,4,5,6,7,8,9.\n\nLet me check the safe freeways at T15:\n\n  y=0: safe.\n  y=3: freeway3: safe.\n  y=4: freeway4: safe (car3 at T15: [6*15-107=90-107=-17, 90-96=-6] -> safe)\n  y=5: freeway5: safe.\n  y=6: freeway6: safe.\n  y=7: freeway7: safe.\n  y=8: freeway8: safe.\n  y=9: safe.\n\nSo at T15, we can be at y=0,3,4,5,6,7,8,9.\n\nWe are at T14: we are at y=1 or y=2? \n\nFrom T13: we were at y=1. So at T14, we can be at:\n  if we go U: y=2\n  if we go D: y=0\n  if we go S: y=1\n\nFrom y=2 at T14: we can go to y=1,2,3 at T15.\n  y=3: safe.\n  y=2: dangerous.\n  y=1: dangerous.\n\nSo the only safe option from y=2 at T14 is to go to y=3 at T15.\n\nFrom y=1 at T14: we can go to y=0,1,2.\n  y=0: safe.\n  y=1: dangerous.\n  y=2: dangerous.\n\nSo the only safe option from y=1 at T14 is to go to y=0 at T15.\n\nFrom y=0 at T14: we can go to y=0,1.\n  y=0: safe.\n  y=1: dangerous.\n\nSo safe options: y=0.\n\nNow, how do we get to T14 at y=0 or y=2? \n\nWe start at T12: y=0.\n  T13: we can go to y=1 (U), y=0 (S), or y=0 (D) [but D from 0 is 0].\n\nIf we choose S or D at T13, we are at y=0 at T13 -> safe.\n  Then at T14: from y=0, we can only go to y=0 or y=1. \n      If we go to y0 at T14: safe, but then at T15 we are at y0 -> safe, but we are not progressing.\n      If we go to y1 at T14: then at T15 we must go to y0 (only safe option) -> and we are at y0 at T15.\n\nIf we choose U at T13, we are at y=1 at T13 -> safe.\n  Then at T14: we can go to y=0,1,2.\n      If we go to y=0: then at T15 we are at y0.\n      If we go to y=2: then at T15 we go to y3.\n\nThe only way to progress is to be at y=2 at T14 and then go to y=3 at T15.\n\nSo let's try that:\n\n  T12: y0\n  T13: U -> y1 (safe)\n  T14: U -> y2 (freeway2 at T14: safe, as computed)\n  T15: U -> y3 (freeway3 at T15: safe)\n\nNow at T15 we are at y3. We need to go to y9.\n\nBut at T16, if we go U to y4, we collide (freeway4 at T16: unsafe).\n\nWe could stay at y3 at T16? \n  T16: y3 -> freeway3 at T16: \n      car3: [6*16-107=96-107=-11, 96-96=0] -> unsafe.\n\nOr go down to y2 at T16? \n  freeway2 at T16: car2: [4*16-71=64-71=-7, 64-60=4] -> 0 in [-7,4] -> unsafe.\n\nSo we cannot be at y2, y3, or y4 at T16.\n\nThe safe freeways at T16 are y0, y5, y6, y7, y8, y9.\n\nWe are at y3 at T15. We need to be at one of the safe freeways at T16. The only actions from y3 are to y2, y3, y4. None of which are safe.\n\nThis is a problem.\n\nWe must be at a higher freeway at T15. For example, if we can be at y4 or y5 at T15, then we can move to y5 or y6 at T16, which is safe.\n\nHow to be at y4 at T15?\n\n  T12: y0\n  T13: y1\n  T14: y2\n  T15: y3 -> not enough.\n\nWe need an extra turn somewhere to move faster. But we can only move one per turn.\n\nUnless we can move up twice in a row without pause, but we are limited.\n\nPerhaps we can use a down move to avoid a collision and then go up later, but that would increase H.\n\nMaybe we can be at y5 at T15? That would require:\n\n  T12: 0\n  T13: 1\n  T14: 2\n  T15: 3 -> not 5.\n\nImpossible.\n\nTherefore, we must spend more than 3 turns to get above freeway4.\n\nWe need to get to freeway5 at some turn. Let's aim to be at freeway5 by a turn when it is safe, and also avoid the danger periods for the lower freeways.\n\nWe might have to wait at a safe freeway until the danger passes.\n\nFor example, freeway1 and2 are dangerous only at T=15,16,17. After T=17, they become safe again? \n\nFor freeway1 and2, car2: [4T-71,4T-60] \n  T=18: [4*18-71=72-71=1, 72-60=12] -> [1,12] -> safe.\n  T=19: [76-71=5,76-60=16] -> safe.\n\nFor freeway3 and4, car3: [6T-107,6T-96]\n  T=18: [6*18-107=108-107=1, 108-96=12] -> safe.\n  T=17: [6*17-107=102-107=-5, 102-96=6] -> 0 in [-5,6] -> dangerous.\n\nSo freeway3 and4 are dangerous at T=16,17, and become safe at T=18.\n\nSo after T=17, the lower freeways become safe.\n\nWe can try to wait at y=0 until T=15 or so, then move up quickly.\n\nFor example:\n\n  T12: 0 (safe)\n  T13: 0 (safe) - action S or D\n  T14: 0 (safe) \n  T15: 0 (safe) \n  T16: U -> 1 (freeway1 at T16: dangerous! because of car2: [4*16-71=64-71=-7,64-60=4] -> unsafe)\n\nSo we must wait until after T=17.\n\n  T12: 0\n  T13: 0\n  T14: 0\n  T15: 0\n  T16: 0\n  T17: 0\n  T18: U -> 1\n\nThen at T18, freeway1: \n  car2: [4*18-71=72-71=1, 72-60=12] -> [1,12] -> safe.\n\nThen we can move up freely? But we have to avoid freeway3 and4 until T=18, but at T18 they are safe.\n\nSo:\n\n  T18: y1 (safe)\n  T19: y2 (freeway2 at T19: car2: [4*19-71=76-71=5,76-60=16] -> [5,16] -> safe)\n  T20: y3 (freeway3 at T20: car3: [6*20-107=120-107=13,120-96=24] -> safe)\n  T21: y4 (freeway4 at T21: car3: [6*21-107=126-107=19,126-96=30] -> safe)\n  T22: y5\n  T23: y6\n  T24: y7\n  T25: y8\n  T26: y9\n\nThis takes 14 turns from T12 (H=14), which is the number of actions from T12 to T25 (inclusive) because we reach y9 at T26, so the last action is at T25.\n\nBut we can move faster. Why not move up as soon as the freeways are safe.\n\nAfter T17, freeway1 and2 are safe. freeway3 and4 are safe after T17 (at T18 and beyond) because at T18 they become safe.\n\nSo we can start moving up at T18.\n\nBut we are at y0 at T17. We can do:\n\n  T18: U -> y1\n  T19: U -> y2\n  T20: U -> y3\n  T21: U -> y4\n  T22: U -> y5\n  T23: U -> y6\n  T24: U -> y7\n  T25: U -> y8\n  T26: U -> y9\n\nThat's 9 actions, from T18 to T26, so we reach y9 at T26.\n\nBut we are at T12 now. We wait from T12 to T17 (5 turns) and then move up in 9 turns, total turns from T12 to T26 is 14 turns (actions at T12 to T25).\n\nBut is there a faster way?\n\nWe can try to be at a safe haven earlier. For example, at T15 we can be at y=5,6,7,8,9.\n\nHow to be at y=5 at T15?\n\n  T12: 0\n  T13: 1\n  T14: 2\n  T15: 3 -> not 5.\n\nImpossible.\n\nOr at T16 we can be at y=5 if we move faster. But we can't.\n\nAlternatively, we might move up to y=4 at a time when freeway4 is safe. freeway4 is safe at T15, but then at T16 it is unsafe.\n\nWe could move from y=4 to y=5 in one turn, but then at T16 we are at y=5, which is safe. \n\nBut how to be at y=4 at T15? \n  as before, we can't.\n\nUnless we are at y=4 at a later time when it is safe. freeway4 is safe for T<16 and T>=18. \n\nSo at T18: freeway4 is safe.\n\nSo if we are at y=4 at T18, then safe.\n\nHow to be at y=4 at T18?\n\n  We need to make 4 up moves in 6 turns (from T12 to T18).\n\n  We can do it. For example:\n\n  T12: 0\n  T13: 0 (wait)\n  T14: 0 (wait)\n  T15: 0 (wait)\n  T16: 0 (wait) -> but freeway0 is safe.\n  T17: U -> 1 (freeway1 at T17: car2: [4*17-71=68-71=-3,68-60=8] -> 0 in [-3,8] -> unsafe! \n        because -3<=0<=8 -> collision.\n\nSo we cannot be on freeway1 at T17.\n\nWe must not be on freeway1 at T17.\n\nSimilarly, freeway2 at T17: car2: [4*17-71=-3,8] -> unsafe.\n\n freeway3 and4 at T17: freeway3: car3: [6*17-107=102-107=-5,102-96=6] -> unsafe.\n\n freeway5 at T17: safe.\n\n freeway6: safe.\n\n freeway7: at T17: [24*17-359=408-359=49, 408-336=72] -> safe.\n\n freeway8: safe.\n\nSo at T17, safe freeways are 0,5,6,7,8,9.\n\nWe are at T16: we can be at y=0,1,2,3,4.\n\nTo be at y=5 at T17, we must be at y=4 at T16.\n\nBut at T16, freeway4 is unsafe.\n\nSo we cannot be at freeway4 at T16.\n\nSimilarly, to be at y=5 at T17, we would have to be at y=4 or y=5 or y6 at T16. But we are coming from below.\n\nFrom T16, if we are at y=4, then at T17 we can go to y=5. But being at y=4 at T16 is unsafe.\n\nIf we are at y=5 at T16, then we are safe (freeway5 is safe), and then at T17 we can be at y=5,6,7.\n\nBut how to be at y=5 at T16? \n  from T12: \n      T12: 0\n      T13: 1\n      T14: 2\n      T15: 3\n      T16: 4 -> unsafe.\n\nSo not possible.\n\nTherefore, we must wait until T18 to start moving up, and then move up continuously from T18 to T26.\n\nBut that is 9 actions and we wait 6 turns (T12 to T17) -> 6 actions of wait and then 9 actions of up, total actions = 15 actions? \n  actions at: T12, T13, T14, T15, T16, T17 (wait), then T18 to T26 (9 actions of up) -> total actions = 6 (wait) + 9 (up) = 15 actions.\n\nBut the turns: \n  T12: action0 (wait) -> at T13 still at 0.\n  ...\n  T17: action5 (wait) -> at T18 at 0.\n  T18: action6 (U) -> at T19 at 1.\n  ...\n  T26: action14 (U) -> at T27 at 9.\n\nSo we reach at T27, so H=15 actions? But we start acting at T12 and act at T12, T13,..., up to T26 (15 actions), and then at T27 we are at y9.\n\nBut the sequence is for turns from t1=12 to t1+H-1, and at turn t1+H-1 we are at 9.\n\nHere, the last action is at T26, and at that turn we move to y9 at T27. But the position at the turn after the last action should be (0,9). \n\nAccording to the player update: after action a_t, at turn t+1 we are at the new position.\n\nWe are at turn t1=12. We take actions at turns 12,13,..., up to the last action at turn 12+H-1, and then at turn 12+H we are at y=9.\n\nSo we require that at turn 12+H, we are at (0,9).\n\nIn our plan, at T27 (which is 12+15) we are at y9. So H=15.\n\nBut is there a shorter path?\n\nWe can try to move up during the safe moments within the danger period.\n\nFor example, freeway5 is always safe. If we can get to freeway5 quickly, then we are safe and can move up.\n\nHow to get to freeway5 in the minimal number of turns from y0.\n\nWe need 5 up moves. So minimally 5 actions.\n\nBut we have to avoid the danger times for freeways 1-4.\n\nWe are at y0 at T12.\n\nWe want to be at y5 at some T>=12.\n\nThe earliest we can be at y5 is T12+5 = T17.\n\nBut at T17, freeway5 is safe.\n\nSo if we can be at y5 at T17, then we can then move up to y9 in 4 more actions, reaching at T21.\n\nTotal actions = 5 (to y5) + 4 ( to y9) = 9 actions.\n\nBut is it possible to be at y5 at T17 without colliding on the way?\n\nWe must check each step:\n\n  T12: start at y0.\n  T13: U -> y1 -> freeway1 at T13: safe.\n  T14: U -> y2 -> freeway2 at T14: safe.\n  T15: U -> y3 -> freeway3 at T15: safe.\n  T16: U -> y4 -> freeway4 at T16: unsafe ( collision with car3: [-11,0] )\n\nSo we collide at T16.\n\nWe could insert a wait somewhere to avoid being at a dangerous freeway at a dangerous time.\n\nFor example, we must not be at freeway4 at T16. So we should avoid being at y4 at T16.\n\nWe can be at y4 at a different turn.\n\nThe only safe turns for freeway4 are T<16 or T>=18.\n\nWe are at y3 at T15. We can't jump to y5 in one move.\n\nSo we must wait at some point.\n\nLet me try to wait at y3 at T15 and T16, then at T17 go to y4.\n\n  T12: U to y1 (T13)\n  T13: U to y2 (T14)\n  T14: U to y3 (T15)\n  T15: S -> stay at y3 (T16)  -> but freeway3 at T16: unsafe ( car3: [6*16-107=-11,0] -> collision)\n\nOr wait at a lower freeway.\n\nSuppose we wait at y0 for one turn:\n\n  T12: S (y0) -> T13: y0\n  T13: U (y1) -> T14: y1 -> freeway1 at T14: safe.\n  T14: U (y2) -> T15: y2 -> freeway2 at T15: unsafe.\n\nOr wait at y1 for one turn:\n\n  T12: U -> T13: y1\n  T13: S -> T14: y1 -> freeway1 at T14: safe.\n  T14: U -> T15: y2 -> freeway2 at T15: unsafe.\n\n The only safe freeways at T15 are y0,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. We are at T14 at y1. To be at y3 at T15, we need to move up two in one turn? No.\n\nSo from y1 at T14, we can only be at y0,1,2 at T15. None of which are safe except y0.\n\nSo if we are at y1 at T14, we can go to y0 at T15.\n\nThen at T15: y0.\n\nThen at T16: from y0 we can go to y0 or y1.\n      y0: safe.\n      y1: freeway1 at T16: unsafe.\n\nSo we can be at y0 at T16.\n\nThen at T17: we can go to y1 -> freeway1 at T17: unsafe.\n\nSo we are forced to wait until T18 to move.\n\nTherefore, the only safe way is to wait until T18 and then move up.\n\nBut let's try to be at y5 at T17 by a different route that avoids the danger freeways.\n\nFrom T12 to T17 we have 5 actions to move up 5 steps, but we may need to use some down or stay to avoid the danger times.\n\nWe want to be at y5 at T17.\n\nWe need to accumulate 5 net up moves.\n\nWe can do a sequence of 5 ups and some down or stay, but within 6 turns (T12 to T17 inclusive is 6 turns, actions at T12 to T16).\n\nActions: T12, T13, T14, T15, T16, and then at T17 we are at some y.\n\nWe want that at T17, we are at y5.\n\nWe start at y0 at T12.\n\nAfter actions at T12 to T16, we are at y5 at T17.\n\nLet a_t be the action at turn t.\n\nThen y13 = y12 + a12 (where a12 in { -1,0,1} for D, S, U)\ny14 = y13 + a13\ny15 = y14 + a14\ny16 = y15 + a15\ny17 = y16 + a16\n\nWe require y17 = 5.\n\nAnd we start at y12=0.\n\nSo a12 + a13 + a14 + a15 + a16 = 5.\n\nEach a_t in { -1,0,1}.\n\nAlso, we must ensure that at each turn T in [12,17], the state at that turn is safe.\n\nFor T=12: y=0 -> safe.\nFor T=13: y13 = 0 + a12 -> must be in [0,9] and safe.\nFor T=14: y14 = y13 + a13 = 0 + a12 + a13\nFor T=15: y15 = 0 + a12+..+a14\nFor T=16: y16 = 0 + a12+..+a15\nFor T=17: y17 = 0 + a12+..+a16 = 5.\n\nAnd we must avoid the danger times.\n\nSpecifically, for T=15: y15 must be in {0,3,4,5,6,7,8,9} (because freeway1 and2 are dangerous)\n for T=16: y16 must be in {0,5,6,7,8,9} ( because freeway1,2,3,4 are dangerous)\n for T=17: y17=5, which is safe.\n\nAlso for the intermediate freeways at T=13,14,16 we must ensure safety.\n\nWe try to find non-negative integer solutions for the net sum=5 with 5 actions ( each in { -1,0,1}).\n\nThe maximal sum is 5 ( if all are U). The minimal is -5.\n\nWe need sum=5, so we must have 5 Ups and 0 down or stay. But then we are at y5 at T17, but we have to check the intermediate steps.\n\nWith 5 ups:\n\n  T12: U -> y1 at T13\n  T13: U -> y2 at T14\n  T14: U -> y3 at T15\n  T15: U -> y4 at T16\n  T16: U -> y5 at T17\n\nCheck safety:\n  T13: y1 -> freeway1: safe.\n  T14: y2 -> freeway2: safe.\n  T15: y3 -> freeway3: safe.\n  T16: y4 -> freeway4: unsafe.\n\nSo fails at T16.\n\nWe must have a down or stay somewhere, but then we cannot reach sum=5.\n\nIf we do 6 actions, we have an extra action.\n\nBut we only have turns from T12 to T16 for actions to influence T17 ( because the action at T16 affects y17).\n\nTo have 5 net up in 5 actions, we need exactly 5 ups.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to be at y5 at T17 without being at y4 at T16, which is unsafe.\n\n So the earliest we can be at y5 is T18.\n\nThen we can do:\n\n  to be at y5 at T18, we need 5 net up in 6 actions (T12 to T17).\n\n  actions: a12 to a17, and y18 = a12+..+a17 = 5.\n\n  and we want to avoid danger.\n\n  for T15: y15 = a12+..+a14 must be in {0,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}\n  for T16: y16 = a12+..+a15 in {0,5,6,7,8,9}\n  for T17: y17 = a12+..+a16 in {0,5,6,7,8,9} (because at T17, freeway1,2,3,4 are dangerous)\n\n and also intermediate turns.\n\n and we start at y12=0.\n\n We can try to do 5 ups and 1 down or stay.\n\n For example, 5 ups and 1 down: net 4, not 5.\n\n or 5 ups and 1 stay: net 5.\n\n So one action is a stay, and five are ups.\n\n The stay can be at any turn.\n\n But we must avoid being at a dangerous freeway at a dangerous time.\n\n Let's try to put the stay at a safe freeway and safe time.\n\n For example, at T15, we must be at a safe freeway: {0,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}.\n\n We are at y15 = a12+..+a14.\n\n Similarly, at T16: y16 = a12+..+a15 must be in {0,5,6,7,8,9}.\n\n and at T17: y17 = a12+..+a16 in {0,5,6,7,8,9}.\n\n Since we have one stay, we can have:\n\n  a12 to a17: five U and one S.\n\n  without loss of generality, the stay can be at any of the six turns.\n\n  But if we do a stay at T12: then y13 = 0 (S) or -1 (D) not possible with U and S. We are doing only U and S.\n\n  So actions: U or S.\n\n  then the net is the number of U's.\n\n  to have net 5, we need 5 U's and one S.\n\n  The S can be at a turn when we are at a safe freeway.\n\n  The sequence of y's:\n\n      T12: 0\n      T13: y13 = 0 + a12 ( a12 in {0,1} for S or U)\n      ...\n\n  try to put the S at T15: then a15=0.\n\n  Then:\n      T12: U -> y13=1\n      T13: U -> y14=2\n      T14: U -> y15=3\n      T15: S -> y16=3\n      T16: U -> y17=4\n      T17: U -> y18=5\n\n  But y16=3 at T16: freeway3 at T16: unsafe.\n\n  put the S at T16: \n      T12: U -> y13=1\n      T13: U -> y14=2\n      T14: U -> y15=3\n      T15: U -> y16=4 ( unsafe at T16)\n      T16: S -> y17=4\n      T17: U -> y18=5\n\n  T16: y4 -> unsafe.\n\n put the S at T17: \n      T12: U -> y13=1\n      T13: U -> y14=2\n      T14: U -> y15=3\n      T15: U -> y16=4 (unsafe)\n      T16: U -> y17=5\n      T17: S -> y18=5\n\n  T16: y4 -> unsafe.\n\n put the S at T14: \n      T12: U -> y13=1\n      T13: U -> y14=2\n      T14: S -> y15=2 ( unsafe at T15 because freeway2 at T15 is dangerous)\n      then not safe.\n\n put the S at T13: \n      T12: U -> y13=1\n      T13: S -> y14=1 ( freeway1 at T14: safe)\n      T14: U -> y15=2 ( unsafe at T15)\n\n put the S at T12: \n      T12: S -> y13=0\n      T13: U -> y14=1\n      T14: U -> y15=2 ( unsafe at T15)\n\n None works.\n\n We try to put the S at a turn when we are at a safe freeway at that turn, and also the next turns are safe.\n\n or use a down move, but then net will be 4, and we need to make an extra up.\n\n so we would need 6 ups and 1 down, net 5.\n\n actions: 6 ups and 1 down, net 5.\n\n then we have 7 actions for 6 turns? \n actions from T12 to T17 (6 actions) and then at T18 we are at y = 0 + net actions = net 5.\n\n So we can do 6 actions: 5 ups and 1 down would net 4, so we need 6 ups and 0 down? net 6, not 5.\n\n or 6 ups and 1 down: net 5, but then we have 7 actions in 6 turns? 6 actions at T12 to T17.\n\n So we can do: 6 actions: let k = number of ups, m = number of downs, s = number of stays, then k+m+s=6, and k-m =5.\n\n then k = m+5, and 2m+5 + s =6 -> 2m+s=1.\n\n solutions: \n   m=0, s=1 -> then k=5 -> net=5, and s=1 -> actions: 5 ups, 0 down, 1 stay.\n   m=1, s=-1 -> impossible.\n\n So only possibility is 5 ups and 1 stay in 6 actions.\n\n and we already tried and failed.\n\n Therefore, the safest and only way is to wait until T18 and then move up continuously.\n\n We will wait from T12 to T17 (6 turns) at y0, and then move up from T18 to T26 (9 turns), but then we reach at T27.\n\n Total actions: from T12 to T26 (15 actions).\n\n But we can move up during the safe freeways after T17.\n\n We don't necessarily have to wait at y0. We can wait at a safe freeway.\n\n For example, after T17, freeway1 and2 become safe. So we can move to freeway1 at T18.\n\n But to move to freeway1 at T18, we can be at y0 at T17 and then move up.\n\n So the plan:\n\n  T12: S -> y0 at T13\n  T13: S -> y0 at T14\n  T14: S -> y0 at T15\n  T15: S -> y0 at T16\n  T16: S -> y0 at T17\n  T17: S -> y0 at T18   [ we could do U at T17, but then at T18 we would be at y1, and at T18 freeway1 is safe, so we can do U at T17 to save one turn.\n\n  T17: U -> at T18 we are at y1.\n  Then:\n      T18: U -> y2 at T19\n      T19: U -> y3 at T20\n      T20: U -> y4 at T21\n      T21: U -> y5 at T22\n      T22: U -> y6 at T23\n      T23: U -> y7 at T24\n      T24: U -> y8 at T25\n      T25: U -> y9 at T26\n\n So actions:\n      T12: S\n      T13: S\n      T14: S\n      T15: S\n      T16: S\n      T17: U\n      T18: U\n      T19: U\n      T20: U\n      T21: U\n      T22: U\n      T23: U\n      T24: U\n      T25: U\n\n This is 14 actions: turns from T12 to T25 inclusive.\n\n Then at T26, we are at y9.\n\n So H=14.\n\n Now verify safety:\n\n  T12: y0 -> safe.\n  T13: y0 -> safe.\n  T14: y0 -> safe.\n  T15: y0 -> safe.\n  T16: y0 -> safe.\n  T17: y0 -> safe. ( action U at T17: at T17 we are at y0, then we move, at T18 we are at y1)\n  T18: y1 -> freeway1: car2 at T18: [4*18-71=72-71=1, 72-60=12] -> [1,12] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n  T19: y2 -> freeway2: car2 at T19: [4*19-71=76-71=5,76-60=16] -> [5,16] -> safe.\n  T20: y3 -> freeway3: car3 at T20: [6*20-107=120-107=13,120-96=24] -> safe.\n  T21: y4 -> freeway4: car3 at T21: [6*21-107=126-107=19,126-96=30] -> safe.\n  T22: y5 -> freeway5: safe.\n  T23: y6 -> freeway6: safe.\n  T24: y7 -> freeway7: safe.\n  T25: y8 -> freeway8: safe.\n  T26: y9 -> safe.\n\n  So no collision.\n\n  The number of turns from T12 to T25 is 14 actions, and we reach (0,9) at T26.\n\n  Therefore, the minimal H is 14.\n\n  But is there a shorter path? We saw that any path that arrives before T26 will have to go through a dangerous freeway at a dangerous time.\n\n  The earliest we can be at y9 is by accumulating 9 net up. The danger zones force us to wait at least until T18 to start moving up. The fastest we can move up is one per turn, so we need 9 turns for the moves. The first move can be at T17 ( to y1 at T18), and then we need 8 more moves to get to y9 at T26. So the actions must start at T17 and go to T25 (9 actions), and we must wait from T12 to T16 (5 actions of wait), total 14 actions.\n\n  So H=14.\n\n  The sequence of actions for turns from 12 to 12+14-1 = 25.\n\n  Actions:\n\n      Turn 12: S\n      Turn 13: S\n      Turn 14: S\n      Turn 15: S\n      Turn 16: S\n      Turn 17: U\n      Turn 18: U\n      Turn 19: U\n      Turn 20: U\n      Turn 21: U\n      Turn 22: U\n      Turn 23: U\n      Turn 24: U\n      Turn 25: U\n\n  But note: at the last action (Turn25: U) we are at y8 at T25, and then at T26 we are at y9.\n\n  So it meets the requirement.\n\n  Therefore, we output:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 12: S\nTurn 13: S\nTurn 14: S\nTurn 15: S\nTurn 16: S\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\nTurn 19: U\nTurn 20: U\nTurn 21: U\nTurn 22: U\nTurn 23: U\nTurn 24: U\nTurn 25: U\n}\n\nNote: We use 'S' for stay.\n\nThis is minimal H=14.\n\nBut is there a way with H<14?\n\nSuppose we try to move up during the wait period when safe.\n\n For example, at T12: we are at y0. We can move up to y1 at T13, which is safe.\n  Then at T13: y1. We can try to stay at T13 at y1? \n      T13: S -> at T14: y1.\n      T14: freeway1 at T14: car2: [4*14-71=56-71=-15,56-60=-4] -> safe.\n  Then at T14: we can stay again at y1 at T15: \n      T15: freeway1 at T15: car2: [4*15-71=60-71=-11,60-60=0] -> unsafe.\n\n  so not.\n\n or from T13: move down to y0 at T14: \n      T14: y0 -> safe.\n  then we are back.\n\n or move up to y2 at T14: \n      T14: freeway2: car2: [4*14-71=56-71=-15,56-60=-4] -> safe.\n  then at T14: y2.\n  then at T15: we must not be at y2 (dangerous) and we can only move to y1,2,3. \n        y1: unsafe.\n        y2: unsafe.\n        y3: safe.\n  so move to y3 at T15: safe.\n  then at T16: from y3, we can only move to y2,3,4. \n        y2: unsafe at T16.\n        y3: unsafe at T16.\n        y4: unsafe at T16.\n  so no.\n\nTherefore, we cannot avoid the wait at the beginning.\n\nSo the answer is the sequence above.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 12\\) is 14. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by waiting at \\(y = 0\\) until the dangerous periods for the lower freeways have passed, then moving up continuously.\n\nThe dangerous periods for the freeways are:\n- Freeways 1 and 2 are dangerous at turns 15, 16, and 17 due to car collisions.\n- Freeways 3 and 4 are dangerous at turns 16 and 17 due to car collisions.\n\nBy staying at \\(y = 0\\) (safe as it has no cars) for turns 12 to 16, the player avoids these dangers. Starting at turn 17, the player moves up one freeway per turn, reaching \\(y = 9\\) at turn 26. The actions are chosen as follows:\n\n- Turns 12 to 16: Stay (S) to remain at \\(y = 0\\).\n- Turns 17 to 25: Move up (U) to advance one freeway per turn, reaching \\(y = 9\\) at turn 26.\n\nThe sequence of actions for turns \\(t_1\\) to \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 25\\) is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 12: S\nTurn 13: S\nTurn 14: S\nTurn 15: S\nTurn 16: S\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\nTurn 19: U\nTurn 20: U\nTurn 21: U\nTurn 22: U\nTurn 23: U\nTurn 24: U\nTurn 25: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) at turn 15 to (0,9) as quickly as possible without colliding with any cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The player can move up, down, or stay each turn, changing the y-position by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCollision happens only if at some turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there's a car where 0 is in its span at that turn. The span changes over time based on the car's speed and direction.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the car positions at any given turn. The initial state is given at turn t1=15. So for any future turn T, I can compute the span for each car.\n\nThe car update is given for T > t1. Since t1=15, for turn T, the time difference is Δt = T - 15.\n\nFor a car, at turn T, the span is:\n\nIf left-moving, span = [h - s*(T-15), τ - s*(T-15)]\n\nBut in the table, for each car, it's given (head, tail, direction, speed). I need to be careful with head and tail.\n\nFor right-moving cars, it says: Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nSimilarly for left-moving: [h, τ] → [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]\n\nIn the table, all cars seem to be right-moving, since direction is \"right\" for all.\n\nLet me check the car states:\n\nFreeway 1: all right, speed 4\n\nCars: (-48,-59,right,4), (-12,-23,right,4), (24,13,right,4)\n\nFor right-moving, Span(t1) = [τ, h], so for first car: τ = -59, h = -48? That doesn't make sense because τ should be less than h if it's moving right? No.\n\nLook: for right-moving, Span(t1) = [τ, h], and since it's moving right, τ is the left end, h is the right end, I think.\n\nIn the description: for right-moving, Span(t1) = [τ, h] → at T, [τ + sΔt, h + sΔt]\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, [h, τ] → [h - sΔt, τ - sΔt]\n\nIn the car list, for freeway 1, first car: head = -48, tail = -59, direction right.\n\nBut if direction is right, and head is -48, tail is -59, since tail is less than head, so τ = tail = -59, h = head = -48, so Span(t1) = [τ, h] = [-59, -48]\n\nThen at time T, Span(T) = [-59 + 4*(T-15), -48 + 4*(T-15)]\n\nSimilarly, second car: head=-12, tail=-23, so [τ, h] = [-23, -12]\n\nAt T: [-23 + 4*(T-15), -12 + 4*(T-15)]\n\nThird car: head=24, tail=13, so [τ, h] = [13,24] at t1=15\n\nAt T: [13 + 4*(T-15), 24 + 4*(T-15)]\n\nFor freeway 2, it's the same as freeway 1: cars identical.\n\nFreeway 3: (48,37,right,6), (12,1,right,6), (-24,-35,right,6)\n\nFirst car: head=48, tail=37, so [τ,h] = [37,48] at t1\n\nAt T: [37 + 6*(T-15), 48 + 6*(T-15)]\n\nSecond car: head=12, tail=1, [1,12] at t1, at T: [1 + 6*(T-15), 12 + 6*(T-15)]\n\nThird car: head=-24, tail=-35, [-35,-24] at t1, at T: [-35 + 6*(T-15), -24 + 6*(T-15)]\n\nFreeway 4: same as freeway 3.\n\nFreeway 5: (48,37,right,12), (12,1,right,12), (-24,-35,right,12)\n\nSimilar, but speed 12.\n\nFirst car: [37,48] at t1, at T: [37 + 12*(T-15), 48 + 12*(T-15)]\n\nSecond: [1,12] at t1, at T: [1 + 12*(T-15), 12 + 12*(T-15)]\n\nThird: [-35,-24] at t1, at T: [-35 + 12*(T-15), -24 + 12*(T-15)]\n\nFreeway 6: only one car: (48,37,right,3)\n\nSo [37,48] at t1, at T: [37 + 3*(T-15), 48 + 3*(T-15)]\n\nFreeway 7: (-48,-71,right,24)\n\nHead=-48, tail=-71, so [τ,h] = [-71,-48] at t1\n\nAt T: [-71 + 24*(T-15), -48 + 24*(T-15)]\n\nFreeway 8: same as freeway 7.\n\nNow, collision occurs at turn T only if the player is on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nThat is, if there exists a car on freeway y_T such that 0 ∈ [left, right] at turn T, where left and right are the ends of the span.\n\nAlso, note that when you move, at turn T, you are on y_T, and you decide action a_T, which determines y_{T+1}, but at turn T, you are still on y_T, so collision depends on y_T and the cars on y_T at turn T.\n\nThe note says: if you move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you are not on y_{T+1} at turn T, so you don't check collision for y_{T+1} at turn T, only for y_T at turn T.\n\nSimilarly, when you arrive at y_{T+1} at turn T+1, you check collision for y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nThe player position: at turn T, position is (0, y_T), and after action a_T, y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy, and so on.\n\nStart at turn 15, y=0.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are not freeways, so no cars there. Freeways are y=1 to 8.\n\nSo at y=0 or y=9, no collision possible.\n\nBut we start at y=0 at turn 15, and need to be at y=9 at some turn.\n\nThe minimal H such that after H turns, we are at y=9.\n\nt starts from t=0 for actions, so actions from turn 15 to turn 15+H-1, and position at turn 15+H-1 is (0,9).\n\nLet’s define the turns.\n\nAt turn T=15, position y=0.\n\nAfter action a_{15}, at turn T=16, position y_16 = y_15 + Δy_{15} = 0 + Δy_{15}\n\nSimilarly, at turn T, position y_T.\n\nWe need y_{15 + t} for t=0 to H, but action at turn T affects y_{T+1}.\n\nSet t as step from current.\n\nCurrent turn: t1=15.\n\nAt time t1, position (0, y_{t1}) = (0,0)\n\nAction a_{t1} is applied to get to next turn.\n\nAfter action a_{t1}, at turn t1+1, position y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + Δy_{t1}\n\nAnd so on, up to after H actions, at turn t1+H, position y_{t1+H}\n\nWe want y_{t1+H} = 9.\n\nAnd H minimal.\n\nThe sequence of actions is for t from t1 to t1+H-1, so H actions over H turns, from turn t1 to t1+H-1, resulting in position at turn t1+H.\n\nAt turn t1, we are at position, then we take action, which determines position at turn t1+1, and so on.\n\nAt turn T, we are at y_T, then we take action a_T, which determines y_{T+1}.\n\nCollision is checked at each turn T for y_T and the cars on that row at that turn.\n\nTo reach y=9 from y=0, since we can only change y by -1,0,1 each step, the minimal number of actions without any obstacles would be 9 up moves, so H=9, but we might need to wait or detour to avoid cars.\n\nSo H >=9.\n\nBut with obstacles, it might be more.\n\nNow, I need to simulate the car positions over time to see when each freeway is safe, i.e., when 0 is not in any car's span for that row.\n\nSince the cars are moving, the times when 0 is covered change.\n\nFor each freeway, I need to find the times when it is unsafe, i.e., when there is a car such that 0 is in its span.\n\nThen, for the player to be on that freeway at turn T, it must be that at that T, the freeway is safe for that T.\n\nAlso, since we start at y=0 at T=15, and need to be at y=9 at some T, and we move step by step.\n\nThe path is a sequence of y positions over turns.\n\nLet me denote T as the turn number, starting from 15.\n\nT=15: y=0\n\nT=16: y= y_16, etc.\n\nI need y_T for T from 15 to some T_end, with y_15=0, y_{T_end}=9, and for each T from 16 to T_end-1, y_T between 1 and 8, and at each T, for row y_T, 0 not in any car span on that row at turn T.\n\nAt T=15, y=0, no car, safe.\n\nAt T_end, y=9, no car, safe.\n\nFor T from 16 to T_end-1, if y_T between 1 and 8, must be safe.\n\nBut y_T could be 0 or 9 during the path, but if at some T, y_T=0 or 9, it's safe, but we need to end at 9, so probably we leave 0 quickly and go to 9.\n\nSince we need to go up, and freeways are 1 to 8, we will be on 1 to 8 at some points.\n\nTo minimize H, we want to go up as fast as possible, but avoid being on a row when it is unsafe.\n\nH is the number of actions, so from T=15 to T=15+H, position at T=15+H is 9.\n\nNumber of turns from start to finish: at T=15, position 0; after H actions, at T=15+H, position 9.\n\nThe actions are taken at turns T=15 to 15+H-1.\n\nFor collision, at each turn T from 15 to 15+H, we check the position y_T and the row.\n\nAt T=15, y=0, safe.\n\nAt T=15+H, y=9, safe.\n\nFor T from 16 to 15+H-1, y_T must be safe if between 1 and 8.\n\ny_T could be 0 or 9, but if y_T=0, it's safe, but we are trying to go to 9, so y_T=0 might happen if we stay or go down, but that would increase H, so probably not minimal to go down.\n\nSimilarly, y_T=9 before the end might happen, but if we reach 9 early, we can stay, but to minimize H, we should not overshoot or stay unnecessarily.\n\nSince we start at 0 and need to be at 9, and moves are ±1 or 0, the minimal H is 9, with all up moves, but we need to check if that path is safe.\n\nWith H=9, we go from y=0 at T=15 to y=9 at T=24.\n\nAt each turn T, position y_T = T - 15, for T from 15 to 24.\n\nT=15, y=0\n\nT=16, y=1\n\nT=17, y=2\n\n...\n\nT=24, y=9\n\nNow, for each T from 16 to 23, y_T from 1 to 8, we need to check if at that T, row y_T is safe, i.e., no car has 0 in span for that row at turn T.\n\nSo let's check for each freeway at each relevant T.\n\nFirst, freeway 1 (y=1):\n\nCars at t1=15:\n\nCar1: span [ -59, -48 ] at T=15, so at time T, span = [ -59 + 4*(T-15), -48 + 4*(T-15) ]\n\nCar2: [ -23, -12 ] at T=15, at T: [ -23 + 4*(T-15), -12 + 4*(T-15) ]\n\nCar3: [13,24] at T=15, at T: [13 + 4*(T-15), 24 + 4*(T-15)]\n\n0 is in span if min <= 0 <= max.\n\nFor car1: -59 + 4Δt <= 0 <= -48 + 4Δt, where Δt = T-15\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFor car1: 0 in span if -59 + 4Δt <= 0 and 0 <= -48 + 4Δt, so -59 +4Δt <=0 => 4Δt <=59 => Δt <= 59/4 = 14.75, so since Δt integer, Δt <=14\n\nAnd 0 <= -48 +4Δt => 48 <=4Δt => Δt >= 12\n\nSo for Δt from 12 to 14 inclusive.\n\nSimilarly, 0 <= -48 +4Δt => 4Δt >=48, Δt >=12\n\nAnd -59 +4Δt <=0 => 4Δt <=59, Δt <=14.75, so Δt <=14\n\nSo Δt=12,13,14\n\nFor car2: [ -23 +4Δt, -12 +4Δt ]\n\n0 in span if -23 +4Δt <=0 and 0 <= -12 +4Δt\n\nFirst: -23 +4Δt <=0 => 4Δt <=23 => Δt <=5.75, so Δt <=5\n\nSecond: 0 <= -12 +4Δt => 12 <=4Δt => Δt >=3\n\nSo Δt=3,4,5\n\nFor car3: [13 +4Δt, 24 +4Δt]\n\n0 in span if 13 +4Δt <=0 and 0 <=24 +4Δt\n\nBut 13 +4Δt <=0 => 4Δt <= -13, impossible since Δt>=0\n\nAnd 0 <=24 +4Δt always true for Δt>=0\n\nSo 13+4Δt <=0 impossible, so 0 never in span for car3.\n\nSimilarly, the min is 13+4Δt >=13>0, so 0 < min, so 0 not in [min,max] since min>0.\n\nSo for freeway 1, unsafe when car1 or car2 has 0 in span.\n\nCar1 unsafe at Δt=12,13,14 → T=15+12=27, 28,29? Δt=T-15, so T=27,28,29\n\nT=15+Δt, so for Δt=12, T=27; Δt=13,T=28; Δt=14,T=29\n\nCar2 unsafe at Δt=3,4,5 → T=18,19,20\n\nCar3 always safe.\n\nSo freeway 1 unsafe at T=18,19,20 (from car2) and T=27,28,29 (from car1)\n\nBut for our path, we care about when we are on y=1, which is at T=16 for y=1.\n\nIn the all-up path, at T=16, y=1.\n\nT=16, Δt=1\n\nAt T=16, freeway 1: car1 span: [-59+4(1), -48+4(1)] = [-55,-44], 0 not in\n\nCar2: [-23+4, -12+4] = [-19,-8], 0 not in (-19 to -8, 0 not in)\n\nCar3: [13+4,24+4]=[17,28], 0 not in\n\nSo at T=16, freeway 1 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, for other times, but since we are only at y=1 at T=16, and it's safe, so for all-up, at T=16, y=1 safe.\n\nNow freeway 2 is same as freeway 1, so identical, unsafe at same times, but at T=16, safe.\n\nIn all-up, we are on y=2 at T=17.\n\nFreeway 2: same as freeway 1, so at T=17, Δt=2\n\nCar1: [-59+8, -48+8] = [-51,-40], 0 not in\n\nCar2: [-23+8, -12+8] = [-15,-4], 0 not in\n\nCar3: [13+8,24+8]=[21,32], 0 not in, safe.\n\nNow freeway 3 (y=3)\n\nCars: speed 6\n\nCar1: at T=15, [37,48], at T: [37 +6Δt, 48+6Δt]\n\n0 in span: 37+6Δt <=0 and 0<=48+6Δt\n\n37+6Δt<=0? 6Δt<=-37, impossible, min=37+6Δt>=37>0, so 0 not in, always safe.\n\nSimilarly, car2: [1,12] at t1, at T: [1+6Δt, 12+6Δt]\n\n0 in span: 1+6Δt <=0 and 0<=12+6Δt\n\n1+6Δt<=0 => 6Δt <=-1, impossible, min=1+6Δt>=1>0, so 0 not in.\n\nCar3: [-35,-24] at t1, at T: [-35+6Δt, -24+6Δt]\n\n0 in span: -35+6Δt <=0 and 0<= -24+6Δt\n\nFirst: -35+6Δt <=0 => 6Δt <=35 => Δt <= 35/6 ≈5.833, so Δt <=5\n\nSecond: 0 <= -24 +6Δt => 24 <=6Δt => Δt >=4\n\nSo Δt=4,5\n\nThus unsafe at T=15+4=19, 15+5=20\n\nAnd car1 and car2 always safe, so freeway 3 unsafe only at T=19,20\n\nIn all-up path, at T=17, y=2, not freeway 3.\n\nFreeway 3 is y=3, at T=18, y=3.\n\nT=18, Δt=3\n\nAt T=18, freeway 3: car3 span: [-35+6*3, -24+6*3] = [-35+18, -24+18] = [-17,-6], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nUnsafe at T=19,20, but at T=18, Δt=3, -35+18=-17, -24+18=-6, both negative, 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly, at T=19, y=3 in all-up, but T=19 is unsafe for freeway 3? Let's see.\n\nIn all-up, at T=18, y=3, which is safe at that time.\n\nAt T=19, y=4? Let's list positions.\n\nT=15: y=0\n\nT=16: y=1\n\nT=17: y=2\n\nT=18: y=3\n\nT=19: y=4\n\nT=20: y=5\n\netc.\n\nAt T=18, y=3, freeway 3.\n\nAt T=18, Δt=3, freeway 3 car3 span: [-35+6*3, -24+6*3] = [-35+18, -24+18] = [-17,-6], min=-17<0, max=-6<0, so 0 not in, since both negative.\n\n0 > max? max=-6<0, so 0 not in [min,max].\n\nSimilarly at T=19, Δt=4, car3 span: [-35+24, -24+24] = [-11,0]\n\nNow min=-11<=0, max=0<=0? 0 <= max is 0<=0, true, and min<=0 true, so 0 is in span? min=-11<=0, max=0, so 0 is included, since it's a closed interval I assume.\n\nThe span is [left, right], so if left <= 0 <= right, then 0 is in.\n\nAt T=19, Δt=4, car3 span: [-35+24, -24+24] = [-11, 0], so left=-11, right=0, so -11 <= 0 <= 0, yes, 0 is included.\n\nSimilarly at T=20, Δt=5, [-35+30, -24+30] = [-5,6], -5 <=0<=6, yes.\n\nSo at T=19 and 20, freeway 3 is unsafe.\n\nBut in all-up path, at T=19, we are on y=4, not y=3.\n\nAt T=19, y=4 for all-up.\n\nFreeway 4 is same as freeway 3, so also unsafe at T=19,20 for y=4? Freeway 4 is y=4.\n\nFreeway 4 has same cars as freeway 3, so unsafe at T=19,20.\n\nAt T=19, y=4, freeway 4.\n\nAt T=19, freeway 4 car3 span: same as above, [-11,0], so 0 in span, unsafe.\n\nSimilarly at T=20, y=5, freeway 5? Let's not get ahead.\n\nFirst, for all-up path:\n\nT=16: y=1, freeway 1, safe as we saw.\n\nT=17: y=2, freeway 2, safe.\n\nT=18: y=3, freeway 3, at T=18, Δt=3, car3 span [-17,-6], 0 not in, safe.\n\nT=19: y=4, freeway 4. Freeway 4 same as freeway 3, cars identical, so at T=19, car3 span [-11,0], 0 in, unsafe. Collision!\n\nSo at T=19, on y=4, freeway 4 is unsafe, collision.\n\nTherefore, all-up is not possible, we hit collision at T=19.\n\nSimilarly, if we go up at T=20, y=5, freeway 5.\n\nBut let's not continue, since collision at T=19.\n\nSo we need to avoid being on y=4 at T=19 or at times when it's unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, y=3 at T=19 and T=20 is unsafe, but at T=18 it is safe.\n\nIn all-up, we are on y=4 at T=19, which is unsafe for freeway 4.\n\nNow, freeway 4 is y=4, and it is unsafe at T=19 and T=20.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3 (y=3) unsafe at T=19 and 20.\n\nNow, we need to go through the freeways safely.\n\nTo minimize H, we should go up as much as possible but wait or adjust to avoid unsafe times.\n\nSince we can stay or move down, but moving down might increase H, so probably staying or timing the moves.\n\nLet's find for each freeway the times when it is unsafe.\n\nFirst, list all freeways and their unsafe times.\n\nFreeway 1 (y=1): unsafe at T=18,19,20 (from car2) and T=27,28,29 (from car1)\n\nBut car2 unsafe Δt=3,4,5 → T=18,19,20\n\nCar1 unsafe Δt=12,13,14 → T=27,28,29\n\nFreeway 2 same as freeway 1, so unsafe at same times.\n\nFreeway 3 (y=3): unsafe at T=19,20 (from car3, Δt=4,5)\n\nCar1 and car2 always safe.\n\nFreeway 4 same as freeway 3, unsafe at T=19,20\n\nNow freeway 5 (y=5): cars with speed 12.\n\nCar1: [37,48] at t1, at T: [37 +12Δt, 48+12Δt]\n\nMin=37+12Δt>0, always, so safe.\n\nCar2: [1,12] at t1, at T: [1+12Δt, 12+12Δt]\n\nMin=1+12Δt>0, always safe.\n\nCar3: [-35,-24] at t1, at T: [-35+12Δt, -24+12Δt]\n\n0 in span: -35+12Δt <=0 and 0<= -24+12Δt\n\nFirst: -35+12Δt <=0 => 12Δt <=35 => Δt <= 35/12 ≈ 2.916, so Δt <=2\n\nSecond: 0 <= -24 +12Δt => 24 <=12Δt => Δt >=2\n\nSo Δt=2\n\nThus unsafe at T=15+2=17\n\nΔt=2, T=17\n\nNow, at Δt=2, span: [-35+24, -24+24] = [-11,0], so 0 in.\n\nAt other times, not.\n\nSo freeway 5 unsafe only at T=17.\n\nFreeway 6 (y=6): only one car (48,37,right,3), so [37,48] at t1, at T: [37+3Δt, 48+3Δt]\n\nMin=37+3Δt>0, always, so always safe. No car covers 0 ever.\n\nFreeway 7 (y=7): car (-48,-71,right,24), so [τ,h] = [-71,-48] at t1, at T: [-71+24Δt, -48+24Δt]\n\n0 in span: -71+24Δt <=0 and 0<= -48+24Δt\n\nFirst: -71+24Δt <=0 => 24Δt <=71 => Δt <= 71/24 ≈ 2.958, so Δt <=2\n\nSecond: 0 <= -48 +24Δt => 48 <=24Δt => Δt >=2\n\nSo Δt=2\n\nUnsafe at T=15+2=17\n\nSpan: [-71+48, -48+48] = [-23,0], 0 in.\n\nFreeway 8 same as freeway 7, unsafe at T=17.\n\nNow, summarize unsafe times for each freeway:\n\ny=1: unsafe T=18,19,20 and T=27,28,29\n\ny=2: same as y=1, unsafe T=18,19,20,27,28,29\n\ny=3: unsafe T=19,20\n\ny=4: unsafe T=19,20\n\ny=5: unsafe T=17\n\ny=6: always safe\n\ny=7: unsafe T=17\n\ny=8: unsafe T=17\n\ny=6 always safe.\n\nWe need to go from y=0 at T=15 to y=9 at some T.\n\nStart at T=15, y=0.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nSince we can only move one step at a time, we must pass through y=1 to y=8.\n\nTo minimize H, we want to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nThe earliest possible is T=24 with all up, but we saw collision at T=19 on y=4.\n\nSo we need to delay or avoid.\n\nOne way is to stay at some point to avoid the unsafe times.\n\nFor example, at T=19 and 20, y=3 and y=4 are unsafe, but y=6 is always safe, y=5 and y=7 unsafe only at T=17.\n\nT=17 is early.\n\nList the safe times.\n\nFor y=1 and y=2, unsafe at T=18,19,20 and 27-29, but since we want to go up quickly, 27-29 is late, so we care about early times.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\ny=6 always safe.\n\ny=5 unsafe only at T=17, so safe at other times.\n\ny=7 unsafe only at T=17, safe otherwise.\n\ny=8 unsafe only at T=17, safe otherwise.\n\nNow, at T=17, y=5,7,8 are unsafe, but y=6 is safe.\n\nWe can plan a path.\n\nStart at T=15, y=0.\n\nWe need to go to y=1 at some point.\n\nAt T=16, if we go up, y=1.\n\nT=16: y=1, freeway 1, is it safe? At T=16, as earlier, for freeway 1, all cars have negative spans, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, T=17: if we go up to y=2, freeway 2 at T=17.\n\nAt T=17, Δt=2, freeway 2 car1: [-59+8, -48+8]=[-51,-40], 0 not\n\nCar2: [-23+8,-12+8]=[-15,-4], 0 not\n\nCar3: [13+8,24+8]=[21,32], 0 not, safe.\n\nBut if we go to y=2 at T=17, safe.\n\nNow at T=18, if we go up to y=3.\n\nT=18: y=3, freeway 3.\n\nAt T=18, Δt=3, freeway 3 car3: [-35+18, -24+18]=[-17,-6], 0 not in, safe.\n\nBut at T=19, if we go to y=4, it would be unsafe, but we can choose not to go up.\n\nAt T=18, we are on y=3, which is safe at T=18.\n\nNow T=19: if we go up to y=4, but freeway 4 at T=19 is unsafe.\n\nIf we stay, y=3, but freeway 3 at T=19 is unsafe! Because at T=19, y=3 unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, if we go down to y=2, freeway 2 at T=19 unsafe.\n\nSo at T=19, if we are on y=2,3,4, all unsafe.\n\ny=2 unsafe at T=19, y=3 unsafe, y=4 unsafe.\n\nWhat about other y?\n\ny=1 at T=19: freeway 1 unsafe at T=19.\n\ny=5 at T=19: freeway 5, unsafe only at T=17, so at T=19, safe.\n\nSimilarly y=6 safe, y=7 safe except T=17, so at T=19 safe, etc.\n\nBut we are at T=18 on y=3.\n\nFrom there, at T=19, we need to move.\n\nIf we go up to y=4, unsafe.\n\nStay on y=3, unsafe.\n\nGo down to y=2, unsafe.\n\nAll options unsafe at T=19.\n\nBut we must be somewhere at T=19.\n\ny=0 or y=9 are safe, but we are at y=3, so we can only go to y=2,3,4.\n\nAll unsafe at T=19.\n\nProblem.\n\nSo at T=19, no matter what we do, if we are on y=2,3,4, it's unsafe.\n\nBut we can be on other y.\n\nFor example, if we can be on y=5 or y=6 at T=19.\n\nBut at T=18, we are on y=3, so to be on y=5 at T=19, we need to move up twice, but we can only move one step per turn.\n\nAt turn T, we are at y_T, take action, move to y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy, with |Δy| <=1.\n\nSo from T=18 to T=19, we can only go to y=2,3,4 from y=3.\n\nCannot jump to y=5.\n\nTherefore, at T=19, we must be on y=2,3, or 4, all of which are unsafe at that time.\n\nThus, it's impossible to be safe at T=19 if we follow the all-up path so far.\n\nBut we might have taken a different path earlier.\n\nFor example, at earlier turns, we could have moved slower or faster.\n\nAt T=15, y=0.\n\nT=16: we can go to y=1 or stay or go down, but go down not useful.\n\nSuppose at T=16, we go to y=1, safe.\n\nT=17: instead of going to y=2, we could stay at y=1 or go down, but go down bad.\n\nIf we stay at y=1 at T=17.\n\nAt T=17, y=1, freeway 1.\n\nIs it safe? At T=17, Δt=2, freeway 1 car1: [-59+8,-48+8]=[-51,-40], 0 not\n\nCar2: [-23+8,-12+8]=[-15,-4], 0 not\n\nCar3: [13+8,24+8]=[21,32], 0 not, safe.\n\nBut at T=17, y=1 is safe.\n\nNow T=18: from y=1, we can go to y=0,1,2.\n\nIf go to y=0, safe, but then we are at bottom, need to go up later, increases H.\n\nGo to y=2, safe? At T=18, y=2, freeway 2.\n\nFreeway 2 at T=18, Δt=3, car1: [-59+12,-48+12]=[-47,-36], 0 not\n\nCar2: [-23+12,-12+12]=[-11,0], oh! min=-11, max=0, so 0 in span, unsafe!\n\nAt T=18, freeway 2 is unsafe because of car2.\n\nSimilarly, y=1 at T=18: freeway 1 car2 at T=18, Δt=3, [-23+12,-12+12]=[-11,0], 0 in, unsafe.\n\nSo at T=18, if we are on y=1 or y=2, unsafe.\n\ny=1 at T=18 unsafe, y=2 at T=18 unsafe.\n\nWhat about y=3 at T=18? As before, safe.\n\nBut to be on y=3 at T=18, we need to be on y=2 or y=3 or y=4 at T=17? Let's see.\n\nAt T=17, we were on y=1 (if we stayed).\n\nFrom y=1 at T=17, at T=18, we can go to y=0,1,2.\n\ny=0 safe, y=1 unsafe, y=2 unsafe.\n\nSo only y=0 is safe at T=18 from there.\n\nBut then we are at y=0.\n\nThen at T=19, from y=0, we can go to y=0 or y=1.\n\ny=0 safe, y=1 at T=19: freeway 1 unsafe at T=19.\n\nSimilarly, not good.\n\nSuppose at T=16, we go to y=1.\n\nThen at T=17, instead of staying, we go down to y=0.\n\nAt T=17, y=0, safe.\n\nThen at T=18, from y=0, go to y=0 or y=1.\n\ny=0 safe, y=1 unsafe at T=18.\n\nSo stay at y=0.\n\nThen at T=19, from y=0, go to y=0 or y=1.\n\ny=0 safe, y=1 unsafe at T=19.\n\nSo stay or go up later, but we need to go up eventually.\n\nBut this delays, H increases.\n\nNot minimal.\n\nPerhaps we can go faster earlier or later.\n\nAnother idea: go to y=6 quickly, since it's always safe.\n\ny=6 is always safe.\n\nBut to go to y=6 from y=0, we need at least 6 up moves.\n\nStart at T=15, y=0.\n\nT=16: go to y=1, safe.\n\nT=17: go to y=2, but at T=17, y=2 freeway 2 is safe? At T=17, Δt=2, freeway 2 car2: [-23+8,-12+8]=[-15,-4], min=-15<0, max=-4<0, 0 not in, safe. Car1 and car3 also not, so yes safe.\n\nT=17: y=2 safe.\n\nNow T=18: if go to y=3, safe as before.\n\nBut then at T=19, problem.\n\nFrom T=18 y=3, at T=19 we must go to y=2,3,4 all unsafe.\n\nSo stuck.\n\nUnless we can be on a different row at T=19.\n\nFor example, if at T=17 we are on a higher row.\n\nAt T=17, we can be at y=2 max from start.\n\ny=2 at T=17.\n\nTo be at y=5 at T=17, for example, we need to have moved faster, but we can only move one per turn, so from T=15 to T=17, we can be at y=0,1,2, not higher.\n\nSo impossible to be on y=5 or above at T=17.\n\nSimilarly, at T=19, we can be at most y=4 if we went all up, or less.\n\ny=4 at T=19 requires 4 up moves from T=15, so at T=19 y=4.\n\nBut y=4 unsafe at T=19.\n\nSimilarly, y=3 at T=19 unsafe, etc.\n\nBut y=5 at T=19 is safe, but to be at y=5 at T=19, we need to be at y=4 or y=5 or y=6 at T=18.\n\nAt T=18, we can be at y=3 if we went all up to that point, or lower.\n\nFor example, at T=18, if we are at y=4, then at T=19 we can go to y=5.\n\nBut at T=18, y=4: freeway 4 at T=18.\n\nAt T=18, Δt=3, freeway 4 car3 span: [-35+18, -24+18] = [-17,-6], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSo at T=18, y=4 is safe.\n\nThen at T=19, from y=4, we can go to y=5.\n\ny=5 at T=19: freeway 5, unsafe only at T=17, so at T=19, safe.\n\nSimilarly, then we can go up to y=6, etc.\n\nBut to be at y=4 at T=18, we need to have moved faster.\n\nFrom start: T=15 y=0\n\nT=16: go to y=1\n\nT=17: go to y=2\n\nT=18: go to y=3? To be at y=4 at T=18, we need to go up from y=3 at T=17 to y=4 at T=18.\n\nAt T=17, we are at y=2, so to be at y=4 at T=18, we need to go up twice, but we can only move one step per turn.\n\nAt T=17, position y=2.\n\nAfter action at T=17, we go to y_{18} = y_17 + Δy_17.\n\nIf we go up, y=3 at T=18.\n\nIf we want y=4 at T=18, we need to have been at y=4 at T=17 or something, but at T=17 we are at y=2.\n\nSo from y=2 at T=17, after action, y_{18} can be 1,2,3.\n\nNot 4.\n\nSo impossible to be at y=4 at T=18.\n\nSimilarly, the highest we can be at T=18 is y=3, by going up each time.\n\nT=15: y=0\n\nT=16: y=1 (after action at T=15)\n\nT=17: y=2 (action at T=16)\n\nT=18: y=3 (action at T=17)\n\nAt T=18, we are at y=3.\n\nThen at T=19, we must be at y=2,3, or 4, all unsafe.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to avoid collision at T=19 if we are on the lower rows at that time.\n\nBut we can be on a higher row earlier or later.\n\nFor example, if we stay at y=0 for some turns, then go up later.\n\nBut that increases H.\n\nWe can go to y=6 directly if possible.\n\nBut to reach y=6, we need to pass through y=1 to 5.\n\nAnother idea: at T=17, y=5 and y=7 are unsafe, but y=6 is safe.\n\nSo if we can be on y=6 at T=17, then safe.\n\nBut to be on y=6 at T=17, from start, we need 6 up moves in 2 turns? Impossible.\n\nFrom T=15 to T=17, only 2 actions, so at T=17, y can be at most 2.\n\nSo cannot.\n\nThe earliest we can be on y=6 is T=21, for example, with all up: T=15 y=0, T=16 y=1, ..., T=21 y=6.\n\nBut at that time, it might be safe, but we have to deal with T=19.\n\nLet's list the unsafe times again.\n\nThe critical point is around T=17 to T=20.\n\nSpecifically:\n\nT=17: y=5,7,8 unsafe; y=1,2,3,4,6 safe? y=1 at T=17: earlier we said freeway 1 safe at T=17.\n\ny=2 safe at T=17.\n\ny=3 safe at T=17? Freeway 3 at T=17, Δt=2, car3 span: [-35+12, -24+12] = [-23,-12], min=-23<0, max=-12<0, 0 not in, so safe.\n\ny=4 at T=17: freeway 4 same, safe.\n\ny=6 safe.\n\ny=5 unsafe at T=17, y=7 unsafe, y=8 unsafe.\n\nBut at T=17, we can only be up to y=2, so y=5,7,8 not reachable, so no problem.\n\nT=18: y=1 and y=2 unsafe; y=3 safe; y=4 safe; y=5 safe (since unsafe only T=17); y=6 safe; y=7 safe (unsafe only T=17); y=8 safe.\n\nT=19: y=1,2,3,4 unsafe; y=5 safe; y=6 safe; y=7 safe; y=8 safe.\n\nT=20: y=1,2,3,4 unsafe; y=5 safe; y=6 safe; y=7 safe; y=8 safe.\n\nT=21: all safe except possibly later, but 27-29 is late.\n\nFor example, at T=21, y=1 could be unsafe if T=21, but y=1 unsafe at T=18,19,20 and 27-29, T=21 is between, so safe.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nSo at T=19 and T=20, only y=5,6,7,8 are safe, but y=5,6,7,8 require being at least y=4 at T=18 to reach, but at T=18, we can only be up to y=3.\n\nAt T=18, we can be at y=3 max.\n\nFrom y=3 at T=18, to be at y=5 at T=19, we need to go up twice, impossible.\n\nSo we cannot be on y=5 or above at T=19.\n\nSimilarly, at T=19, the only safe rows are y=5,6,7,8, but we cannot reach them from y=3 at T=18 in one step.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to be safe at T=19.\n\nBut that can't be right; there must be a way.\n\nPerhaps we can be on y=0 or y=9, but at T=19, if we are on y=0, safe, or y=9, safe, but to be on y=0 at T=19, we need to have gone down or stayed low, but then H increases.\n\nSimilarly for y=9.\n\nSo to avoid being on unsafe rows at unsafe times, we need to be on a safe row or out of range.\n\nAt T=19, safe rows are y=0,5,6,7,8,9.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, and y=5,6,7,8 are safe at T=19.\n\nBut to be on y=5 at T=19, we need to be on y=4,5, or 6 at T=18.\n\nAt T=18, safe rows: from above, at T=18, y=1 and y=2 unsafe, but y=3 safe, y=4 safe, y=5 safe, etc.\n\ny=3 and y=4 are safe at T=18.\n\nSo at T=18, we can be on y=3 or y=4, both safe.\n\nThen from there, to be on y=5 at T=19, if we are on y=4 at T=18, we can go up to y=5 at T=19.\n\nSimilarly, if on y=3 at T=18, we can go to y=4 at T=19, but y=4 unsafe at T=19.\n\nOr to y=3 or 2, unsafe.\n\nBut if we are on y=4 at T=18, then at T=19 go to y=5, which is safe.\n\nThen we can proceed.\n\nBut how to be on y=4 at T=18?\n\nFrom start, to be at y=4 at T=18, we need to have moved faster.\n\nAt T=15: y=0\n\nAfter action at T=15, y_16 = y_15 + Δy_15\n\nIf Δy= +1, y_16=1\n\nAt T=16, action a_16, y_17 = y_16 + Δy_16\n\nIf +1, y_17=2\n\nAt T=17, action a_17, y_18 = y_17 + Δy_17\n\nIf +1, y_18=3\n\nSo at T=18, y=3, not 4.\n\nTo be at y=4 at T=18, we need y_18=4.\n\ny_18 is determined by actions from T=15 to T=17.\n\nAfter 3 actions, from y=0, we can be at y=3 max.\n\nCannot be at y=4 at T=18.\n\nSimilarly, the position at T=18 is at most y=3.\n\nSo we cannot be on y=4 at T=18.\n\nTherefore, at T=18, we can only be on y=0,1,2,3.\n\nBut at T=18, y=1 and y=2 are unsafe, so only y=0 or y=3 are safe.\n\ny=0 or y=3.\n\nIf we are on y=3 at T=18, safe.\n\nThen at T=19, we can only go to y=2,3,4, all of which are unsafe at T=19.\n\nIf we are on y=0 at T=18, safe, then at T=19, we can go to y=0 or y=1.\n\ny=0 safe, y=1 unsafe at T=19.\n\nSo we can stay at y=0 or go to y=1 unsafe.\n\nBut we can stay at y=0 at T=19, safe.\n\nThen later go up.\n\nBut this means we delay going up to avoid the unsafe times.\n\nFor example, stay at y=0 until after T=20.\n\nThen go up.\n\nBut let's see the times.\n\nUnsafe for lower rows until T=20.\n\nAt T=21, all rows are safe, as per earlier.\n\nFor example, at T=21, y=1: freeway 1, at Δt=6, car1: [-59+24, -48+24]=[-35,-24], 0 not in; car2: [-23+24, -12+24]=[1,12], min=1>0, 0 not in; car3: [13+24,24+24]=[37,48], 0 not in; safe.\n\nSimilarly, other rows safe.\n\ny=3 at T=21, freeway 3 car3: [-35+6*6, -24+6*6]=[-35+36, -24+36]=[1,12], min=1>0, safe.\n\netc.\n\nSo after T=20, all freeways are safe.\n\nT=21 onwards safe.\n\nAt T=20, y=1,2,3,4 unsafe, but y=5,6,7,8 safe.\n\nBut to be on y=5 at T=20, we need to be on y=4,5,6 at T=19, but at T=19, y=4,5,6: y=4 unsafe, y=5 safe, y=6 safe.\n\nBut to be on y=5 or y=6 at T=19, we need to be on y=4,5,6 or y=5,6,7 at T=18.\n\nAt T=18, y=4,5,6: y=4 safe, y=5 safe, y=6 safe.\n\nBut at T=18, we can only be up to y=3, as established.\n\nSo impossible to be on y=4 or above at T=18.\n\nTherefore, the only way is to be on a safe row at the unsafe times, which for T=19 and T=20, safe rows are y=0,5,6,7,8,9, but we can't reach y=5+ from below in time, so we must be on y=0 or possibly y=9, but y=9 is far.\n\nSo we need to stay at y=0 during the unsafe turns.\n\nFor example, at T=15, y=0.\n\nWe can stay at y=0 for several turns.\n\nAt T=16, if we stay, y=0, safe.\n\nT=17, stay, y=0, safe.\n\nT=18, stay, y=0, safe.\n\nT=19, stay, y=0, safe.\n\nT=20, stay, y=0, safe.\n\nThen at T=21, we can start going up.\n\nFrom T=21, y=0, we can go up to y=1 at T=22, y=2 at T=23, ..., y=9 at T=30.\n\nT=21: y=0\n\nAfter action at T=21, y_22 =1 if up\n\nT=22: y=1\n\nAction at T=22, y_23=2\n\n...\n\nUp to T=30: y=9\n\nH = number of actions from T=15 to T=29? Let's calculate.\n\nAt T=15, position y=0.\n\nAfter 0 actions, at T=15.\n\nAfter 1 action (at T=15), at T=16, y= y_16\n\n...\n\nAfter k actions, at T=15+k, position y_{15+k}\n\nWe want y_{15+H} =9.\n\nWith all up, from y=0 to y=9, H=9, at T=24.\n\nBut with delay, if we stay at y=0 from T=15 to T=20, that's 5 turns at y=0.\n\nAt T=20, y=0.\n\nThen from T=20 to T=29, 9 actions to go to y=9.\n\nActions:\n\nAt T=20, we are at y=0.\n\nAction at T=20: U, then at T=21, y=1\n\nAction at T=21: U, T=22, y=2\n\n...\n\nAction at T=28: U, T=29, y=9\n\nSo from T=20 to T=29, 9 actions, but at T=20, we start from y=0.\n\nThe position at T=20 is y=0 after no action at that point? Let's clarify.\n\nAt turn T=20, position y_20.\n\nIf we have been at y=0 from T=15 to T=20, so y_20=0.\n\nThen action at T=20: a_20, which determines y_21.\n\nIf a_20=U, y_21=1\n\nThen action at T=21: U, y_22=2\n\n...\n\nAction at T=28: U, y_29=9\n\nSo we reach y=9 at T=29, with actions from T=20 to T=28, 9 actions.\n\nBut we also have actions from T=15 to T=19 to stay at y=0.\n\nAt T=15: action S, y_16=0\n\nT=16: action S, y_17=0\n\nT=17: action S, y_18=0\n\nT=18: action S, y_19=0\n\nT=19: action S, y_20=0\n\nThen T=20: action U, y_21=1\n\nT=21: U, y_22=2\n\nT=22: U, y_23=3\n\nT=23: U, y_24=4\n\nT=24: U, y_25=5\n\nT=25: U, y_26=6\n\nT=26: U, y_27=7\n\nT=27: U, y_28=8\n\nT=28: U, y_29=9\n\nSo at T=29, y=9.\n\nNumber of actions: from T=15 to T=28, that's 14 actions.\n\nH=14, since y_{15+H} = y_{29} =9, so 15+H=29, H=14.\n\nT=15+H =29, so H=14.\n\nBut is this minimal? We stayed 5 turns, but we might stay less.\n\nThe unsafe period is T=18,19,20 for the lower rows, but at T=17, we can be on y=2, safe, but then at T=18, if we go to y=3, safe, but stuck at T=19.\n\nSince at T=18, we can be on y=3, safe, but then at T=19, we must move to unsafe row.\n\nBut if we could be on y=6 at T=19, we can, but we can't reach.\n\nAnother idea: go to y=6 as soon as possible and stay there during unsafe times.\n\nBut to reach y=6, we need 6 up moves.\n\nEarliest at T=21: T=15 y=0, T=16 y=1, T=17 y=2, T=18 y=3, T=19 y=4, but at T=19 y=4 unsafe, and we can't reach y=6 before T=21.\n\nT=21 y=6 if we go up continuously.\n\nBut at T=19, we are on y=4, unsafe.\n\nIf we start going up but pause at some point.\n\nFor example, at T=15: U to y=1 at T=16\n\nT=16: U to y=2 at T=17\n\nT=17: instead of U, we stay at y=2? At T=17, y=2 safe.\n\nThen at T=18, from y=2, we can go to y=3 (safe at T=18) or stay or down.\n\nBut if go to y=3, safe.\n\nThen at T=19, problem.\n\nIf at T=17 we stay at y=2, then at T=18, we are at y=2, but at T=18, y=2 unsafe! Because freeway 2 unsafe at T=18.\n\nSo cannot stay at y=2 at T=18.\n\nAt T=17, if we go down to y=1, but at T=18 y=1 unsafe.\n\nOr go to y=0, safe.\n\nBut then same as before.\n\nSo the only safe way during T=18 to T=20 is to be on y=0 or y=3 at T=18, but y=3 at T=18 safe, but then at T=19 no safe move.\n\nUnless we can be on y=3 at T=18 and then at T=19 go to y=3, but unsafe, or we can go to y=4, unsafe.\n\nNo.\n\nPerhaps we can be on y=6 at T=19 by going faster, but impossible.\n\nSo I think the only way is to stay at y=0 until after T=20.\n\nBut we can start going up earlier as long as we are not on unsafe rows at unsafe times.\n\nFor example, at T=16, go to y=1, safe.\n\nT=17, go to y=2, safe.\n\nThen at T=18, we must leave y=2 because unsafe, so we can go to y=3 (safe at T=18) or to y=1 (unsafe) or y=0 (safe).\n\nIf we go to y=3 at T=18, safe.\n\nThen at T=19, we have to move from y=3 to y=2,3,4 all unsafe, so collision.\n\nIf at T=18 we go to y=0 from y=2, so at T=18, action D, y_19=1? y_18 = y_17 + Δy_17.\n\nAt T=17, we are at y=2.\n\nAction at T=17: if we go down, Δy=-1, then y_18 = 2-1=1.\n\nBut at T=18, y=1, which is unsafe! Because freeway 1 unsafe at T=18.\n\nIf we go down to y=1 at T=18, unsafe.\n\nIf we go directly to y=0 from y=2 at T=17? Action D, y_18 =1, not 0, because from y=2, down to y=1.\n\nTo go to y=0, we need to be at y=1 and go down.\n\nAt T=17, y=2, action D, y_18=1.\n\nThen at T=18, y=1, which is unsafe.\n\nIf we do nothing, y_18=2, unsafe.\n\nSo the only safe choice at T=18 from y=2 is to go to y=3, but then at T=19 stuck.\n\nOr, from T=17, instead of being at y=2, we can be lower.\n\nBut at T=17, if we are at y=1, then at T=18, we can go to y=0, safe, or y=1 unsafe, y=2 unsafe.\n\nSo go to y=0.\n\nThen at T=19, from y=0, go to y=0 or y=1, y=0 safe, y=1 unsafe, so stay at y=0.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut still, we end up staying at y=0 during T=18 to T=20.\n\nTo minimize H, we should go up as soon as possible after the unsafe period.\n\nUnsafe for lower rows until T=20.\n\nAt T=21, all safe.\n\nSo we can be at y=0 at T=20, then go up from there.\n\nBut to be at y=0 at T=20, we can have moved up a bit before.\n\nFor example:\n\nAt T=15: U, y_16=1\n\nT=16: U, y_17=2\n\nT=17: S or D, but at T=17, y=2 safe, but at T=18, if we stay, y=2 unsafe, so we must move.\n\nIf we go down to y=1, at T=18 y=1 unsafe.\n\nGo to y=3, safe at T=18, but then T=19 unsafe.\n\nSo better to go down to y=0 at some point.\n\nSuppose at T=17: from y=2, go down to y=1, but then at T=18 y=1 unsafe.\n\nNot good.\n\nAt T=16: from y=1, instead of U to y=2, go down to y=0.\n\nAt T=16, action D, y_17=0\n\nThen at T=17, y=0, safe.\n\nThen at T=18, from y=0, we can go to y=0 or y=1.\n\ny=0 safe, y=1 unsafe at T=18, so stay y=0.\n\nSimilarly at T=19, stay y=0.\n\nT=20, stay y=0.\n\nThen T=21, go U to y=1, and so on.\n\nBut we wasted some moves.\n\nFrom above, with two up moves to y=2 at T=17, then we have to go down or something, but it's messy.\n\nThe earliest we can start going up safely is from T=21.\n\nSo to be at y=0 at T=20, then go up.\n\nPosition at T=20: y=0.\n\nThen actions:\n\nT=20: U, y_21=1\n\nT=21: U, y_22=2\n\nT=22: U, y_23=3\n\nT=23: U, y_24=4\n\nT=24: U, y_25=5\n\nT=25: U, y_26=6\n\nT=26: U, y_27=7\n\nT=27: U, y_28=8\n\nT=28: U, y_29=9\n\nReach at T=29.\n\nNumber of actions from T=15 to T=28.\n\nBut we need to get to T=20 at y=0 with some actions.\n\nFrom T=15 to T=20, we need to have y_20=0.\n\nWith minimal actions, we can stay at y=0.\n\nAt T=15: S, y_16=0\n\nT=16: S, y_17=0\n\nT=17: S, y_18=0\n\nT=18: S, y_19=0\n\nT=19: S, y_20=0\n\nThen from T=20 to T=28 as above.\n\nActions at T=15 to T=28: 14 actions.\n\nH=14.\n\nBut we can be at higher y at T=20 if possible, but at T=20, y=0 is fine.\n\nSince y=6 is always safe, we could go directly to y=6 after T=20.\n\nBut with the same H.\n\nPerhaps we can reach earlier by going to y=6 during the safe period, but the lower rows are unsafe before T=21.\n\nAnother thought: at T=17, y=5 is unsafe, but we can't be there.\n\nOr at T=19, y=5 is safe, but can't reach.\n\nI think H=14 is the best we can do.\n\nBut let's confirm if we can save one turn.\n\nSuppose we go up to y=3 at T=18, which is safe, then at T=19, even though it's unsafe, we have to be there, but we can't avoid collision.\n\nSo impossible.\n\nPerhaps for freeway, the collision is only if 0 in span, but for y=3 at T=19, it is unsafe, so we can't be there.\n\nSo I think we must stay at y=0 until T=20.\n\nBut at T=20, we can be at y=0, then go up.\n\nBut at T=20, when we go up to y=1 at T=21, it is safe.\n\nIn the action sequence, we have to specify actions from turn 15 onwards.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be a sequence of actions.\n\nBut in this case, with H=14, we reach at T=29.\n\nBut let's see if we can start going up earlier for higher rows.\n\nFor example, at T=15: U, to y=1 at T=16\n\nT=16: U, to y=2 at T=17\n\nNow at T=17, y=2 safe.\n\nBut at T=18, we cannot stay at y=2, cannot go to y=1 or y=2 both unsafe, so must go to y=3, safe at T=18.\n\nThen at T=18, y=3 safe.\n\nAt T=19, we need to take action. If we go up to y=4, unsafe; stay y=3 unsafe; down to y=2 unsafe.\n\nNo choice, collision.\n\nIf at T=17, from y=2, we go down to y=1, but at T=18 y=1 unsafe.\n\nOr go to y=0 directly? From y=2, down to y=1 at T=18, then unsafe.\n\nSo only from T=17, go down to y=1 at T=18, unsafe, or to y=3, then stuck.\n\nSo no way.\n\nTherefore, we must not be on y=1 or y=2 at T=18, and not on y=2,3,4 at T=19, etc.\n\nSo the safe way is to be on y=0 from T=15 to T=20, then go up.\n\nBut at T=20, we are at y=0, then action U at T=20 to y=1 at T=21.\n\nThen up each step to y=9 at T=29.\n\nH=14 actions from T=15 to T=28.\n\nT=15 to T=28 inclusive is 14 turns, actions at those turns.\n\nPosition at T=29.\n\nWe can have fewer actions if we reach earlier, but with obstacles, not possible.\n\nPerhaps we can go to y=6 faster after, but no.\n\nAnother idea: since y=6 is always safe, we can go to y=6 and stay, but we need to reach it.\n\nEarliest to reach y=6 is at T=21 with all up, but to do that, we need to be on y=1 at T=16, etc., but at T=19 y=4 unsafe.\n\nSo not possible.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 14.\n\nBut let's list the actions.\n\nStart at T=15, y=0\n\nAction for turn t1=15: S (stay), so y_16=0\n\nTurn t1+1=16: S, y_17=0\n\nTurn 17: S, y_18=0\n\nTurn 18: S, y_19=0\n\nTurn 19: S, y_20=0\n\nTurn 20: U, y_21=1\n\nTurn 21: U, y_22=2\n\nTurn 22: U, y_23=3\n\nTurn 23: U, y_24=4\n\nTurn 24: U, y_25=5\n\nTurn 25: U, y_26=6\n\nTurn 26: U, y_27=7\n\nTurn 27: U, y_28=8\n\nTurn 28: U, y_29=9\n\nSo at T=29, y=9.\n\nNumber of actions: from turn 15 to 28, 14 actions.\n\nSequence: S,S,S,S,S,U,U,U,U,U,U,U,U,U\n\nBut we can reduce the number of S at start if possible, but in this case, we have to stay until T=20.\n\nAt T=15, we can go to y=1 immediately, but then we have to come back or stay, but at T=18 and 19, y=1 unsafe, so we need to be at y=0 at those times.\n\nFor example:\n\nT=15: U, y_16=1\n\nThen at T=16: from y=1, we can go down to y=0, action D, y_17=0\n\nThen at T=17: S, y_18=0\n\nT=18: S, y_19=0\n\nT=19: S, y_20=0\n\nThen same as before, but we used one U and one D, but still from T=20 go up.\n\nThen actions: T=15: U\n\nT=16: D\n\nT=17: S\n\nT=18: S\n\nT=19: S\n\nT=20: U\n\nT=21: U\n\n...\n\nUp to T=28: U, y_29=9\n\nBut now we have 14 actions still, from T=15 to T=28.\n\nBut we reached y=1 and back, which didn't help, and we have an extra D move, so the position at T=20 is still y=0, same as before.\n\nBut H is the same, 14.\n\nIn terms of number, same.\n\nBut with the first sequence, all S until T=19, then U from T=20.\n\nIn this, we have U and D, which cancels, so net same.\n\nSo no gain.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 14.\n\nBut let's confirm the answer format.\n\nWe need to output the sequence.\n\nBut in the sequence, for turn 15 to turn 28.\n\nBut the player reaches at turn 29.\n\nH is the number of actions, so for t from 0 to H-1, but in terms of turns.\n\nIn the task: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" so for t=0, a_{t1}, t=1, a_{t1+1}, ..., up to t=H-1, a_{t1+H-1}\n\nThen position at turn t1 + H is (0,9)\n\nIn this case, t1=15, so actions from turn 15 to turn 15+H-1, position at turn 15+H.\n\nWith H=14, actions at turns 15 to 28, position at turn 29 is (0,9).\n\nSequence: as above.\n\nBut in the sequence, we have to specify for each turn.\n\nAlso, in the car states, there are cars on other freeways, but since we are only on the rows at certain times, and we checked, it should be fine.\n\nFor example, at T=21, y=1, freeway 1 is safe, as we saw.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nPerhaps we can go faster to y=6.\n\nFor example, after T=20, we are at y=0.\n\nThen we need to go to y=9.\n\nBut y=6 is safe, so we can go directly, but still 9 steps.\n\nSince from y=0 to y=6, 6 steps, then to y=9, 3 more, but same as going step by step.\n\nNo shortcut.\n\nSo I think H=14 is minimal.\n\nBut let's see if we can reach by T=28 or something.\n\nSuppose we go up to y=3 at T=18, safe, then at T=19, we have to move, but all choices unsafe, so impossible to avoid collision at T=19 if on y=3 at T=18.\n\nSimilarly, if we are at y=0 at T=18, safe, then at T=19, we can be at y=0 or y=1, y=0 safe, y=1 unsafe, so we can be at y=0.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo no.\n\nTherefore, the minimal sequence is to stay at y=0 for turns 15 to 19 (actions S), then at turn 20 go up, and up each turn to 28.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 15: S\n\nTurn 16: S\n\nTurn 17: S\n\nTurn 18: S\n\nTurn 19: S\n\nTurn 20: U\n\nTurn 21: U\n\nTurn 22: U\n\nTurn 23: U\n\nTurn 24: U\n\nTurn 25: U\n\nTurn 26: U\n\nTurn 27: U\n\nTurn 28: U\n\nPosition at turn 29: y=9.\n\nNow, in the sequence, turn 19 action S, y_20=0\n\nThen turn 20 U, y_21=1, etc.\n\nYes.\n\nTo write in the box.\n\nBut the answer should be for the sequence.\n\nAlso, in the car state, freeway 6 has only one car, always safe, but we don't need to use it.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nI think this is the way.\n\nSo minimal H is 14.\n\nBut let's double-check if we can save a turn by going to a higher row earlier.\n\nFor example, at T=20, we are at y=0.\n\nBut if we could be at y=1 at T=20, then we can reach y=9 at T=28.\n\nBut to be at y=1 at T=20, we need to have moved up before.\n\nBut during T=18 and 19, y=1 is unsafe, so we cannot be on y=1 at T=18 or T=19.\n\nAt T=20, y=1 is safe? At T=20, freeway 1: Δt=5, car1: [-59+20, -48+20]=[-39,-28], 0 not; car2: [-23+20,-12+20]=[-3,8], min=-3<=0, max=8>=0, so 0 in span? -3 <=0<=8, yes, so at T=20, freeway 1 is unsafe!\n\nI forgot.\n\ny=1 unsafe at T=20 as well.\n\nSimilarly, y=2,3,4 also unsafe at T=20.\n\nAt T=20, only y=5,6,7,8 safe, and y=0,9.\n\nBut to be on y=1 at T=20, unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, we can only be on y=0 at T=20 to be safe.\n\nThen go up from T=21.\n\nAt T=21, y=1 is safe, as before.\n\nSo no gain.\n\nTherefore, confirmed.\n\nSo the sequence is as above.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 15\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) is 14. This requires staying at \\(y = 0\\) (safe, as no cars are present) during turns 15 to 19 to avoid the unsafe periods for the lower freeways (e.g., \\(y = 1, 2, 3, 4\\) are unsafe at turns 18, 19, and 20). Starting from turn 20, the player moves up one row per turn to reach \\(y = 9\\) at turn 29.\n\nThe sequence of actions \\(\\{a_{15 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{13}\\) (for turns 15 to 28) is as follows:\n\n- At turn 15, the player is at \\((0, 0)\\). Action \\(S\\) (stay) results in position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn 16.\n- At turn 16, action \\(S\\) results in position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn 17.\n- At turn 17, action \\(S\\) results in position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn 18.\n- At turn 18, action \\(S\\) results in position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn 19.\n- At turn 19, action \\(S\\) results in position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn 20.\n- At turn 20, action \\(U\\) (up) results in position \\((0, 1)\\) at turn 21.\n- At turn 21, action \\(U\\) results in position \\((0, 2)\\) at turn 22.\n- At turn 22, action \\(U\\) results in position \\((0, 3)\\) at turn 23.\n- At turn 23, action \\(U\\) results in position \\((0, 4)\\) at turn 24.\n- At turn 24, action \\(U\\) results in position \\((0, 5)\\) at turn 25.\n- At turn 25, action \\(U\\) results in position \\((0, 6)\\) at turn 26.\n- At turn 26, action \\(U\\) results in position \\((0, 7)\\) at turn 27.\n- At turn 27, action \\(U\\) results in position \\((0, 8)\\) at turn 28.\n- At turn 28, action \\(U\\) results in position \\((0, 9)\\) at turn 29.\n\nThis sequence ensures that:\n- At all turns from 16 to 28, the player is not on a freeway row when it is unsafe (collision occurs only if \\(0\\) is in a car's span on the current freeway row at that turn).\n- Freeways are safe at the times the player is on them:\n  - \\(y = 1\\) at turn 21: safe (no car spans contain 0).\n  - \\(y = 2\\) at turn 22: safe.\n  - \\(y = 3\\) at turn 23: safe.\n  - \\(y = 4\\) at turn 24: safe.\n  - \\(y = 5\\) at turn 25: safe.\n  - \\(y = 6\\) at turn 26: always safe.\n  - \\(y = 7\\) at turn 27: safe (unsafe only at turn 17).\n  - \\(y = 8\\) at turn 28: safe (unsafe only at turn 17).\n\nNo shorter sequence is possible, as being on any freeway row from 1 to 4 during turns 18–20 results in collision, and the player cannot reach a safe higher row (e.g., \\(y = 5\\) or above) by turn 19 due to movement constraints.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 15: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 16: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 17: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 18: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 19: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 20: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 21: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 22: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 23: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 24: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 25: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 26: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 27: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 28: U \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>We are given the current turn t1 = 18 and the player is at (0,0). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns H, avoiding collisions.\n\nThe player can move up (U: y+1), down (D: y-1), or stay (S: y unchanged). Note that the grid has y from 0 to 9, so we cannot go below 0 or above 9.\n\nThe collision condition: at turn T, if the player is at y_T, then we check the cars on freeway i = y_T. Collision occurs if 0 (the x-coordinate of the player) is in the span of any car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nImportant note: when moving from y_T to y_{T+1} at turn T, we are only on freeway y_T at turn T. So at turn T, we check the cars on freeway y_T. When we are in the air (moving) we are not on the next freeway until the next turn.\n\nThe car update: \n- For a right-moving car: at time T, the span is [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)] (since at t1 it was [tau, h] and it moves right by s per turn).\n- For a left-moving car: [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)].\n\nBut note: the given cars are at t1 (current turn). So for a future turn T, we compute the car's span at T.\n\nWe are to find the minimal H and the sequence of actions from turn t1 (18) to turn t1+H-1 such that at turn t1+H-1, the player is at y=9.\n\nWe start at y=0 at turn 18.\n\nWe need to traverse from y=0 to y=9. We have 8 freeways (y=1 to y=8) with cars. We must avoid being on a freeway when a car covers x=0 at that turn.\n\nWe can use BFS (breadth-first search) over states (turn, y) to find the minimal steps. The state is (t, y) where t is the current turn (starting at 18) and y is the current position.\n\nThe actions: U, D, S. But note that we cannot go below 0 or above 9.\n\nWe simulate from turn 18 to as many turns as needed until we reach y=9.\n\nAt each state (t, y), we check if we are safe: if y==0 or y==9, then there are no cars (freeways are 1..8). But note: the goal is (0,9) and we are safe at y=0 and y=9? Actually, the problem says \"freeways y=1,...,8\", so y=0 and y=9 are safe.\n\nHowever, note that at the moment we are at y=0 (turn 18) we are safe. Similarly, when we reach y=9, we are safe.\n\nBut when we are on freeways 1..8, we must check the cars on that freeway at turn t.\n\nWe are given the cars at turn t1 (18). So for a future turn t, we compute the car positions.\n\nWe note that the cars on each freeway are given. We must compute for a given freeway k and turn t (relative to t1: delta = t - 18) the span of each car and check if 0 is in any span.\n\nLet me write a helper function to check if at turn t and freeway k, the position x=0 is occupied by any car.\n\nGiven a car (head, tail, direction, speed) at time 18:\n\nIf direction is 'right':\n  At time t (>=18), the car has moved by s*(t-18) to the right.\n  So the tail becomes tail + s*(t-18)\n  The head becomes head + s*(t-18)\n\nBut note: the representation for right-moving: at time 18, the car is [tail, head] (because the head is greater than the tail). Then at time t, it becomes [tail + s*(t-18), head + s*(t-18)].\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving: at time 18, the car is [head, tail] (with head > tail, but moving left) then at time t, it becomes [head - s*(t-18), tail - s*(t-18)].\n\nBut wait: the given representation for left-moving? In the car update rule:\n\nLeft-moving: initial span at t1 is [h, tau] -> becomes [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut note: in the given data, all cars in the current state are right-moving? Let me check:\n\nThe table:\n\nFreeway 1: (-48,-59,right,4) -> but note: -48 > -59, so the head is -48 and tail is -59? Then the span is [-59, -48]? But the update rule for right-moving says: [tau, h] -> [tau + s*dt, h+s*dt]. Actually, the problem says for right: \"Span(t1)=[tau, h]\" and then becomes [tau+s*dt, h+s*dt]. So the initial span is [tau, h] meaning from tau to h (with tau <= h). But in the given data, for freeway1: (-48,-59,right,4): here h=-48, tau=-59? But then tau < h, so the span is [-59, -48]. Then at time t, it becomes [-59 + 4*(t-18), -48 + 4*(t-18)].\n\nSimilarly, for freeway3: (48,37,right,6) -> head=48, tail=37? Then the initial span is [37,48]. But wait: the problem says for a right-moving car: \"Span(t1)=[tau, h]\" so tau should be the left end and h the right end. Here, 37<48, so [37,48]. Then at time t: [37+6*(t-18), 48+6*(t-18)].\n\nBut note: the first car on freeway1: (-48,-59,right,4): here tau=-59, h=-48 -> [-59,-48]. Then at time t: [-59+4*(t-18), -48+4*(t-18)].\n\nSimilarly, the second car on freeway1: (-12,-23,right,4): [-23,-12] -> becomes [-23+4*(t-18), -12+4*(t-18)].\n\nThird car: (24,13,right,4): [13,24] -> [13+4*(t-18),24+4*(t-18)].\n\nNow, we must check for a given (t, k) if 0 is in any of the car spans on freeway k at time t.\n\nWe note: the cars on each freeway are independent.\n\nWe have freeways 1 to 8. The cars for each freeway are:\n\nk=1: [ (-59,-48,right,4), (-23,-12,right,4), (13,24,right,4) ]\nBut wait, the input says: \n  Freeway 1: (-48,-59,right,4), (-12,-23,right,4), (24,13,right,4)\n\nBut note: the representation is (head, tail, ...). For the first car: head=-48, tail=-59. Then the span is [min(-48,-59), max(-48,-59)]? Actually, no. The problem states: for right-moving, the span at t1 is [tau, h] meaning the tail is the left endpoint and head is the right endpoint. So we must have tau <= h. Therefore, for the first car: head=-48, tail=-59 -> so tau=-59, h=-48 -> the span is [-59, -48]. Similarly, the second car: head=-12, tail=-23 -> so tau=-23? Wait, no: the problem says \"head\" and \"tail\". For a right-moving car, the head is the front (right end) and tail is the rear (left end). So the span is [tail, head] = [-59, -48] for the first car? But -59 < -48, so [-59, -48] is correct.\n\nSimilarly, second car: head=-12, tail=-23 -> so [tail, head] = [-23, -12]? But wait: tail=-23, head=-12 -> so [-23, -12]. But the input says (-12,-23,right,4). So the first number is head, second is tail. Therefore, we have:\n\nCar representation: (head, tail, direction, speed)\n\nFor right: span = [min(head,tail), max(head,tail)]? Actually, no: because if tail is the left and head the right, then we must have tail <= head. So in the given data, the tail is the smaller number and head the larger? But look:\n\nFirst car: head=-48, tail=-59 -> but -59 < -48, so tail=-59, head=-48 -> [ -59, -48 ].\n\nSecond car: head=-12, tail=-23 -> tail=-23, head=-12 -> [-23, -12].\n\nThird car: head=24, tail=13 -> [13,24].\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut note: freeway 7 and 8: (-48,-71,right,24) -> head=-48, tail=-71 -> [-71, -48].\n\nNow, for a given freeway k and turn t, we compute the spans of all cars on that freeway at turn t and check if 0 is in any of them.\n\nWe must simulate the moves.\n\nWe are to find the minimal H (number of turns) to get to y=9.\n\nWe can use BFS:\n\nState: (y, t) where t is the current turn (starting at 18) and y in [0,9]. We start at (0,18). We want to reach (9, t) for some t.\n\nThe actions: U, D, S. But note:\n\n- U: y -> y+1 (if y<9)\n- D: y -> y-1 (if y>0)\n- S: y -> y\n\nAt each step, we consider the next state: at turn t+1, we will be at y' (which is y, y+1, or y-1) and we must check:\n\n- At turn t, we are at freeway y_old. We must check the cars on freeway y_old at turn t? Actually, the collision condition: at turn T, if the player is at y_T, then we check freeway y_T at turn T.\n\nSo when we are at state (y, t), that means at turn t we are at freeway y (or y=0 or y=9 which are safe). We must check that (y, t) is safe. But note: we start at (0,18) which is safe.\n\nThen we choose an action for turn t, which will determine our position at turn t+1. However, note that the action taken at turn t affects our position at turn t+1. But the collision at turn t is already determined by our position at turn t (which we are at).\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nAt turn t (state: we are at y_t), we choose an action a_t. Then:\n- We must be safe at turn t: meaning if y_t is between 1 and 8, then we check the cars on freeway y_t at turn t: if 0 is in any car span, then this state is unsafe -> we cannot be here.\n- Then we move: at turn t+1, we will be at y_{t+1} = y_t + delta, where delta depends on a_t.\n\nTherefore, when we are at state (y, t), we first check if (y, t) is safe. If not, we discard. Then we generate the next states for the next turn.\n\nWe start at (0,18): safe.\n\nThen we consider the actions: U, D, S. But note: we are at y=0, so D is not allowed (would go to -1) -> invalid. So from (0,18): we can only do U (to y=1) or S (stay at y=0).\n\nBut if we do S, we stay at y=0 at turn 19? Actually, no: the action at turn 18: if we do S, then at turn 19 we are still at y=0? Actually, no:\n\nThe update: at turn t, we are at y_t. Then we choose a_t, and then at turn t+1, we have y_{t+1} = y_t + delta.\n\nSo at turn 18: we are at y=0. Then we choose a_18. Then at turn 19, we are at y_19 = y_18 + delta.\n\nTherefore, when we are at (0,18), we are safe. Then we choose an action for turn 18, which will lead to state (y_19, 19).\n\nBut then at turn 19, we must check the safety at (y_19, 19).\n\nSo the BFS:\n\nWe consider states (y, t) and we record the minimal steps to get there (and the path).\n\nWe start: (0,18) with 0 steps.\n\nThen we consider the next action: from state (y, t), we consider the three actions (if valid) and compute the next state (y', t+1). Then we check if (y', t+1) is safe? Actually, we check the state (y', t+1) for safety: meaning at turn t+1 and position y', is it safe? And also we must check the intermediate state? Actually, no: because the move happens entirely at the turn: at turn t we are at y, and at turn t+1 we are at y'. We are not at y' at turn t, so we only check (y, t) when we are at that state? Actually, when we are at state (y, t), we have already survived the collision check at turn t (because we check at the state). Then when we leave, we don't check again? Actually, the state (y, t) must be safe to be in. Then we move to the next state (y', t+1) and we check that one when we get there.\n\nSo algorithm:\n\nLet Q be a queue. We start with state (0,18) and path = [].\n\nWhile Q is not empty:\n  pop state (y, t) and the path so far.\n  If y==9: then we have a solution. The number of turns H = number of actions = length(path). But note: we started at turn 18 with no action taken? Actually, we are at turn 18, and we are about to choose the first action for turn 18. Then after H actions, we will have taken H steps and be at turn 18+H.\n\n  But note: we start at turn 18 at position 0. Then we take an action at turn 18, which moves us to turn 19 at a new position. Then at turn 19, we take another action, etc.\n\n  Therefore, the state (y, t) represents that at turn t, we are at position y. The actions we have taken are from turn 18 to turn t-1, so the number of actions = t - 18.\n\n  When we reach y=9 at turn t, then H = t - 18? But wait: the problem says: a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t} for t=0 to H-1. And we require that at turn t1+H-1 we are at (0,9). \n\n  Actually, if we are at (9, t) at turn t, then the last action was taken at turn t-1. So the actions we took: from turn 18 to turn t-1: that's (t-1) - 18 + 1 = t-18 actions? Actually, the actions are taken at turns: 18, 19, ..., t-1 -> that's (t-1 - 18 + 1) = t-18 actions.\n\n  And the turn at which we are at (0,9) is turn t. So we have: t1+H-1 = t? \n      => 18 + H - 1 = t  => H = t - 17.\n\n  Alternatively: the actions are for t=0 to H-1: meaning the actions at turns: 18+0, 18+1, ..., 18+H-1. Then at the end of these actions, we are at turn 18+H. And we require that at turn 18+H-1 we are at (0,9)? Actually, the problem says: \"at turn t1+H-1\" we are at (0,9). \n\n  But note: the action at turn t1 (18) is the first action. Then after H actions, we have advanced H turns. So the last action is at turn t1+H-1 = 18+H-1. Then at the next moment (turn 18+H) we would be at the new position? But the problem says: we are to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1. \n\n  Actually, the update rule: \n      y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t, \n  so at the moment we take action a_{t} at turn t, then at the next turn t+1 we are at the new y.\n\n  But the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning t from 0 to H-1: so the actions are for turns: t1+0, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\n  Then after taking the last action at turn t1+H-1, we have:\n      y_{t1+H} = ... \n  But we require that at turn t1+H-1 we are at (0,9). \n\n  How? \n\n  Actually, the state at turn t1 (18) is given. Then we take the first action at turn 18 (a_{18}) and then at turn 19 we are at a new y. Then we take a_{19} at turn 19, and then at turn 20 we are at the next, ... until we take a_{t1+H-1} at turn 18+H-1. Then after that action, we are at turn 18+H. \n\n  But the problem says: \"at turn t1+H-1\" we are at (0,9). This must be the state at the beginning of the turn? Or after the action?\n\n  Let me re-read: \"at turn t1+H-1\" we are at (0,9). And we are to take the action at that turn? Actually, the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and then we require that at turn t1+H-1 we are at (0,9). \n\n  How do we interpret the state at turn t? It seems the state (0, y_t) is at the beginning of turn t. Then we choose an action a_t, and then we update to the next state at turn t+1.\n\n  But then at turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9). Then we don't take an action at turn t1+H-1? \n\n  Actually, the sequence of actions is for turns t1 to t1+H-1. Then the last action is taken at turn t1+H-1. And then the state at the end of that action (i.e., at the beginning of turn t1+H) would be? \n\n  Alternatively, the problem might mean: we are at (0,9) at the moment we have taken the last action (so at turn t1+H-1, after the action). But the update rule says that after the action at turn t, the next state is at turn t+1.\n\n  This is ambiguous.\n\n  Let me look: \"at turn t1+H-1\" we are at (0,9). And we are taking an action at that turn? But if we are already at (0,9) at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, then we don't need to take an action? \n\n  Actually, the problem says: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" such that we reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1.\n\n  This implies that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9). But then we don't take an action at that turn? \n\n  But the sequence of actions goes from t1 to t1+H-1. So we take an action at turn t1+H-1? That would then move us to a new state at turn t1+H. \n\n  This is confusing.\n\n  Alternatively, the problem might mean that after taking the action at turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1? But the update rule says the new state is at turn t1+H.\n\n  I think there is a misunderstanding.\n\n  Let me reexamine the update rule: \n      \"y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t\"\n\n  So the state at time t+1 depends on the action at time t.\n\n  Therefore, the state at time t is the state at the beginning of the turn. Then we choose an action a_t, and then we transition to state at time t+1: y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta.\n\n  Then the condition: we require that at turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9). But that means at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9). Then we don't necessarily take an action at that turn? But the sequence of actions must include an action for turn t1+H-1? \n\n  The problem says: the sequence is for t=0 to H-1: meaning actions at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1. Then at turn t1+H-1, we take an action. But then after that action, we are at turn t1+H, and we are at y_{t1+H} = y_{t1+H-1} + Delta.\n\n  Therefore, to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1 (the beginning of that turn) and then we take an action. But we want to be at (0,9) at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, and then we take an action? But the problem says we must be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1. \n\n  However, note that after the action at turn t1+H-1, we leave that state. So if we are at (0,9) at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we can choose to stay (S) and then we remain at (0,9) for the next state? Or we can move? But the goal is to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1. \n\n  Actually, the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\". So we must be at (0,9) at the beginning of turn t1+H-1. Then we can take any action? But we don't care what happens after? \n\n  However, the problem also says: \"minimal number of turns H\". And the sequence of actions is for H turns (from t1 to t1+H-1). \n\n  Therefore, we want to be at (0,9) at the beginning of turn t1+H-1. \n\n  How do we achieve that? \n\n  We start at (0,0) at the beginning of turn 18. \n\n  Then we take actions at turns 18, 19, ..., 18+H-2, and then at the beginning of turn 18+H-1, we are at (0,9). \n\n  So the number of actions is H-1? \n\n  But the problem says the sequence is {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} -> that's H actions. \n\n  And we are to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1. \n\n  How? \n\n  Example: H=1: then we have one action: at turn 18. Then we must be at (0,9) at turn 18+1-1 = 18. But at the beginning of turn 18 we are at (0,0). Then we take an action at turn 18. Then at the beginning of turn 19, we are at a new state. But we require at turn 18 (the beginning) we are at (0,0) not (0,9). So H=1 is impossible.\n\n  H=2: we take two actions: at turn 18 and 19. Then we require at turn 18+2-1 = 19, we are at (0,9). So at the beginning of turn 19, we are at (0,9). \n\n  How? \n      Turn 18: we start at (0,0). Then we take an action a_18. Then we move to (0, y_19) at the beginning of turn 19. We want y_19=9.\n\n  So we must move from 0 to 9 in one action? But the actions only change by -1,0,1. So impossible.\n\n  H=10: we take 10 actions: from turn 18 to 27. Then we require at turn 18+10-1=27, we are at (0,9). So at the beginning of turn 27, we are at (0,9).\n\n  How did we get there? \n      We started at turn 18: (0,0)\n      Then we took 10 actions: a_18, a_19, ..., a_27? Actually, the last action is at turn 27? But the sequence is for t=0 to 9: so a_18, a_19, ... a_27? That would be 10 actions, and the last action is at turn 27. Then the state at the beginning of turn 28 would be determined by a_27. But we require at the beginning of turn 27 we are at (0,9). \n\n  Actually, the state at the beginning of turn 27 is the result of the actions taken from turn 18 to 26. \n\n  Therefore, the actions we take: \n      a_18 (at turn 18) -> affects state at turn 19\n      a_19 (at turn 19) -> affects state at turn 20\n      ...\n      a_{18+H-1} (at turn 18+H-1) -> affects state at turn 18+H.\n\n  But we require the state at turn 18+H-1 to be (0,9). \n\n  So the state at turn 18+H-1 is the result of the actions taken from turn 18 to 18+H-2. Therefore, the last action we take is at turn 18+H-1, but that action does not affect the state at turn 18+H-1. It affects the state at turn 18+H.\n\n  This implies that we do not need to take an action at turn 18+H-1 to be at (0,9) at turn 18+H-1. But the problem requires a sequence of H actions: from turn 18 to 18+H-1.\n\n  And then we are at (0,9) at turn 18+H-1. \n\n  How can we be at (0,9) at turn 18+H-1? That means we must have arrived there by the actions taken at turns 18 to 18+H-2. Then at turn 18+H-1, we are already at (0,9) and then we take an action (which might move us away). \n\n  But the problem does not require that we stay at (0,9) after that, only that at turn 18+H-1 we are there.\n\n  Therefore, we can take an action at turn 18+H-1 arbitrarily (but we must avoid collision at that turn: if we are at (0,9) then it's safe, so we can choose any action? but we are at y=9, so we cannot go up. We can choose S or D? but D would go to 8, which is not safe? but we don't care about the next state? only that at turn 18+H-1 we are at (0,9). \n\n  However, the problem says: \"avoid collisions\" at every turn. So at turn 18+H-1, if we are at (0,9) we are safe. Then we take an action, which might move us to 8 or 9 (if we go down or stay). But then at turn 18+H, we are at that new position. But the problem does not require that we avoid collision after turn 18+H-1? It only says \"avoid collisions\" during the journey until we reach (0,9) at turn 18+H-1. \n\n  But note: the problem says: \"a sequence of actions ... to reach (0,9), avoiding collisions with cars on freeways\"\n\n  This implies that we must avoid collisions at every turn from 18 to 18+H-1 (because we are taking actions at these turns and moving, and we are on the grid at turns 18 to 18+H-1). \n\n  However, when we are at (0,9) at turn 18+H-1, we are safe. Then we take an action at that turn, which will move us to a new position at turn 18+H. But we don't care about turn 18+H? because we only require to be at (0,9) at turn 18+H-1. And we have avoided collisions at all turns from 18 to 18+H-1.\n\n  Therefore, the action at turn 18+H-1 can be arbitrary (as long as it doesn't cause a collision at turn 18+H-1: but we are at y=9, so safe). \n\n  However, we must be cautious: the action at turn 18+H-1 might cause a collision at turn 18+H? But the problem does not require avoiding collisions after the goal. So we don't care.\n\n  Therefore, in our BFS, we can stop when we first reach (9, t) for any t. Then the number of turns H = t - 17? because:\n\n      We start at turn 18: state (0,18)\n      We want to be at (9, t) for some t.\n      Then the number of actions taken is (t - 18) -> but the actions are taken at turns 18, 19, ... , t-1 -> that's (t-18) actions.\n\n      Then H = number of actions = t-18.\n\n      And the turn at which we are at (9,t) is t, which should be 18+H-1? \n          => 18+H-1 = t  => H = t-17.\n\n      But we have H = t-18 (actions). So we have a discrepancy.\n\n  Alternatively, we can think:\n\n      We take H actions: at turns 18, 19, ... , 18+H-1.\n\n      Then after the last action (at turn 18+H-1), we are at the state at turn 18+H.\n\n      But we require that at turn 18+H-1 we are at (0,9). \n\n      How can that be? \n\n      The state at turn 18+H-1 is the result of actions taken from 18 to 18+H-2. So we don't need to take the H-th action to get there? \n\n  This is very confusing.\n\n  Let me try to reconcile:\n\n      The problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning for t in [0, H-1]: \n          a_{t1+0}, a_{t1+1}, ..., a_{t1+H-1}\n\n      Then the condition: at turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9).\n\n      And the update: \n          At turn t1, we are at y_{t1} (given as 0).\n          Then we apply a_{t1} and get y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + Delta_{a_{t1}}.\n          ...\n          At turn t1+H-1, we are at y_{t1+H-1}. We apply a_{t1+H-1} and get y_{t1+H} = y_{t1+H-1} + Delta_{a_{t1+H-1}}.\n\n      But the condition is that at turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9). So y_{t1+H-1} = 9.\n\n      Therefore, the last action (a_{t1+H-1}) is applied at a state (9) and then we go to 10? or 8? or 9? but that doesn't matter.\n\n      So in our BFS, we are searching for a state (9, t) for some turn t. And the actions taken are from turn 18 to turn t-1. Then the number of actions H = t - 18.\n\n      And the turn at which we are at (9) is t = 18+H-1? \n          => 18+H-1 = t  => H = t-17.\n\n      But we also have H = number of actions = t-18.\n\n      So we have: t-18 = t-17 -> which is impossible.\n\n  Alternatively, the problem might mean that the sequence of actions is for turns t1 to t1+H-1, and after taking these actions, the state at turn t1+H is (0,9). But the problem explicitly says: at turn t1+H-1.\n\n  I think there is a mistake in the problem statement.\n\n  Let me read carefully: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\"\n\n  This means: at the turn numbered t1+H-1, we are at (0,9). \n\n  But in the update rule, the state at turn t is the state at the beginning of the turn, and then we take an action. \n\n  So if we are at (0,9) at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, then we got there by actions taken in previous turns. The actions we take at turn t1+H-1 will then move us away. \n\n  And the sequence of actions includes an action for turn t1+H-1. \n\n  Therefore, in our BFS, we are not done until we have taken the action at turn t1+H-1? But we are already at the goal at the beginning of turn t1+H-1.\n\n  Actually, we can stop as soon as we reach (9, t) for any t>=18. Then the number of actions taken to get there is (t - 18) (because we took actions at turns 18,19,...,t-1). Then we must provide H = number of actions = t-18. And then the last state is at turn t, which is t1 + (t-18) - 1? \n\n  We want: t = t1+H-1 = 18+H-1.\n\n  And H = t-18 -> then t = 18 + (t-18) - 1 -> t = t-1 -> which is not true.\n\n  This indicates a fundamental issue.\n\n  I think the intended meaning is that the journey takes H turns (including the starting turn) and we take H-1 actions? But the problem says the sequence of actions has length H.\n\n  Another possibility: the turn count includes the action turn. We start at turn 18, and we are at (0,0). Then we take an action at turn 18, and then we are at a new state at the next turn, which is turn 19. But the problem might consider that the first action is part of turn 18, and then the state after the action is the state for turn 19. Then the goal is to be at (0,9) at the state of turn 18+H-1.\n\n  Then the number of actions is H, and the state at turn 18+H-1 is the state after H actions, starting from turn 18.\n\n  Example: \n      H=1: then we do one action at turn 18, and then at turn 19, we are at (0,9). -> so we require moving from 0 to 9 in one action: impossible.\n      H=10: then we do 10 actions: at turns 18,19,...,27. Then at turn 18+10-1=27, we are at (0,9). \n\n  So the state at turn 27 is the state after the 10th action? But the actions are taken at turns 18 to 27, and the state at turn 27 is the result of the action at turn 26. The action at turn 27 will then affect turn 28.\n\n  Therefore, to be at (0,9) at turn 27, we must have gotten there by the action at turn 26. \n\n  So in our BFS, we are looking for a state (9, t) for some t>=18, and the number of actions taken to get there is (t - 18). Then we set H = number of actions = t - 18.\n\n  Then the turn at which we are at (9) is t = 18+H-1? \n      18+H-1 = t => H = t-17.\n  But we also have H = t-18, so t-18 = t-17 -> -18 = -17, which is false.\n\n  This is still not working.\n\n  Let me define:\n      Let the state at turn 18 be s0 = (0,0).\n      After 0 actions, we are at turn 18.\n      After 1 action (at turn 18), we are at turn 19.\n      ...\n      After k actions, we are at turn 18+k.\n\n  We require that at turn 18+H-1, we are at (0,9). \n\n  This means that after (H-1) actions, we are at turn 18+H-1, and at (0,9).\n\n  Therefore, we need to find a path of length (H-1) actions to reach (0,9) at turn 18+H-1.\n\n  Then the sequence of actions has length H-1? \n\n  But the problem says the sequence is {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} -> that's H actions.\n\n  This suggests that the problem has an off-by-one error.\n\n  Given the confusion, and since the problem is from a contest, I recall that in the first turn (turn 18) we are given the state, and then we take an action. Then the next turn. \n\n  Typically in such problems, the minimal number of actions is what matters, and the turn count is just the starting turn plus the number of actions.\n\n  So I think the intended meaning is: \n      We are to take exactly H actions (from turn 18 to turn 18+H-1), and then at the state after these actions (which is at turn 18+H) we are at (0,9). \n\n  But the problem explicitly says \" at turn t1+H-1\".\n\n  Alternatively, the state at turn t is the state before taking the action at turn t. Then the action at turn t changes the state to state at turn t+1.\n\n  Then the condition: at turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9) -> means that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9). Then we take the action a_{t1+H-1} (which is the last action in the sequence) and then we go to turn t1+H.\n\n  So the number of actions is H, and the state at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 is (0,9).\n\n  Therefore, in our BFS, we want to find a state (9, t) for t = 18+H-1, and the number of actions taken to get there is H-1. But the sequence has H actions, because we include the action at turn t=18+H-1 (even though we are already at the goal).\n\n  So algorithm:\n\n      We are at (0,18) -> state (0,18).\n      We want to find a path to (9, t) for some t>=18, with minimal t-18 (actions taken) plus one for the last action? \n\n  Actually, the number of actions in the sequence is H = (t - 18) + 1? \n      - From turn 18 to turn t-1: that's (t-18) actions to get to state (9,t) at the beginning of turn t.\n      - Then we take one more action at turn t (which is the last action in the sequence) even though we are already at the goal.\n\n  But then the state (9,t) must be safe, and then we take any action (safe or not? but we only require to avoid collision on the freeways we are on during the turns we are on them. At turn t, we are on freeway 9 (safe) so any action is safe.\n\n  Then the total number of actions H = (t - 18) [actions to get to (9,t)] + 1 [the action at turn t] = t-18+1.\n\n  And the turn at which we are at (0,9) is turn t = 18+H-1? \n      18+H-1 = t  => H = t-17.\n  and we also have H = t-18+1 = t-17, which checks out.\n\n  Therefore, we do:\n\n      BFS until we find a state (9, t) for some t>=18. Then the number of actions H = t - 17.\n      The actions: the actions taken to get to (9,t) are from turn 18 to turn t-1 -> actions[0] to actions[t-19] (0-indexed), and then for turn t, we can choose any action (say S, since we are at 9 and S is safe).\n\n  But note: the problem only requires that at turn t=18+H-1 we are at (0,9). And we are. Then the last action (at turn t) is part of the sequence.\n\n  However, the sequence of actions must be provided for turns 18 to 18+H-1 = t.\n\n  Example: if we found a state (9,19) (so t=19), then H = 19-17 = 2.\n      Actions: \n          turn 18: a_18 (which moved us to some state at turn 19, but not necessarily 9; how did we get to (9,19)?)\n      This suggests we are at (9,19) at the beginning of turn 19.\n\n  How did we get to (9,19)? \n      At turn 18: state (0,18) -> then we take an action a_18 that should move us to (9,19)? impossible because we can only move by 1.\n\n  Therefore, we must have taken more actions.\n\n  Let me try: \n      We want to be at (9, t) at the beginning of turn t.\n      To get there, we must have been at 8,9, or 10 (invalid) at the beginning of turn t-1, and then taken an action that left us at 9 at turn t.\n\n      Specifically:\n          if at turn t-1 we were at 8 and took U -> 9.\n          or at 9 and took S -> 9.\n          or at 10 and took D -> 9, but 10 is invalid.\n\n      So from 8 with U or from 9 with S.\n\n  Therefore, the state (9,t) is achieved by the action at turn t-1.\n\n  So in our BFS, we are state (y, t) and we got there by an action at turn t-1.\n\n  Then the number of actions to get to (9,t) is (t-18) actions: actions at turns 18,19,...,t-1.\n\n  Then the sequence has (t-18) actions. But the problem requires H actions, and then we are at (0,9) at turn 18+H-1.\n\n  So we set H = (t-18) actions? and then 18+H-1 = 18 + (t-18) - 1 = t-1, but we are at (9,t) at turn t, not at turn t-1.\n\n  This is not matching.\n\n  Given the time, I think the safest is to assume that the problem means: \n      We take H actions, and after these H actions, we are at (0,9) at the turn 18+H.\n\n  Then the condition is: at turn 18+H, we are at (0,9).\n\n  Then H actions: turns 18 to 18+H-1, and then at turn 18+H we are at (0,9).\n\n  Then in our BFS, we want to find a state (9, t) with t = 18+H, and the number of actions is H = t-18.\n\n  Then the turn at which we are at (0,9) is t = 18+H = 18+H.\n\n  But the problem says \" at turn t1+H-1\", which would be 18+H-1.\n\n  So unless the problem meant turn t1+H, then it's off by one.\n\n  Given the provided examples in the problem might clarify, but there are none, I think we should follow the BFS for the state (9, t) and then output the actions until we reach it, and then H = t - 18, and then the turn at which we are at (0,9) is turn t = 18+H.\n\n  Then the problem might have a typo and meant \" at turn t1+H\".\n\n  To align with the problem's answer format, which says the last action is at turn t1+H-1, and then at turn t1+H-1 we are at (0,9), we must output the actions including the one that made us arrive at 9 at the next turn.\n\n  But note: if we are at (8, t-1) and we take U, then at turn t we are at 9. So the action U at turn t-1 is what made us arrive at 9 at turn t. Then at the beginning of turn t, we are at 9. \n\n  Then if we want to be at (0,9) at turn t = 18+H-1, then we do not take an action at turn t. But the sequence requires an action for turn t.\n\n  This is a deadlock.\n\n  Due to the time, I will assume the following: \n      We are to take actions for turns 18, 19, ... until we are at (0,9) at the beginning of a turn, and then we stop. The last action we took was at the previous turn.\n\n  But the problem requires a sequence of exactly H actions and then at turn 18+H-1 we are at (0,9).\n\n  How about we: \n      We BFS until we find a state (9, t) for some t. This state is at the beginning of turn t.\n      Then the number of actions taken to get there is t-18.\n      Then we set H = t-18.\n      Then the turn at which we are at (0,9) is turn t = 18+H.\n      But the problem wants turn 18+H-1.\n\n  So to output, we see that at turn t-1 = 18+H-1, we were at some state, and then we took the last action to get to (9,18+H) at turn 18+H.\n\n  But the problem wants us to be at (0,9) at turn 18+H-1.\n\n  Unless we are at (0,9) at turn 18+H-1 by not moving on the last action? \n\n  We can try: if we are at (9, 18+H-1) at the beginning of turn 18+H-1, then we are at (0,9) at turn 18+H-1. Then we take an action at turn 18+H-1 (say S) and then at turn 18+H we are still at 9.\n\n  then the state at turn 18+H-1 is (9) -> which is the goal.\n\n  Therefore, we can stop the BFS when we find (9, t) for any t>=18, and then the number of actions is H = t - 18 + 1? \n      because we took actions from turn 18 to turn t-1 to get to (9,t) -> that's (t-18) actions, and then we need to output one more action for turn t ( which is the last action in the sequence, and we are at (9) at turn t, so we can choose 'S').\n\n  Then the total number of actions H = t-18+1.\n  and then turn at which we are at (0,9) is turn t = 18+(H)-1 = 18+t-18+1-1 = t, which is correct.\n\n  Therefore, the process:\n\n      We B until we find a state (9, t) for some t. \n      Then we will output H = t-18+1 actions.\n        actions for turns 18 to t: \n           turns 18 to t-1: the actions that brought us to (9,t)\n           turn t: action 'S'\n\n      But note: to get to (9,t) at the beginning of turn t, we took actions at turns 18 to t-1.\n\n      So the sequence has (t-18) actions for turns 18 to t-1, and then one action for turn t.\n\n      Total actions: (t-18)+1 = t-18+1 = H.\n\n      And the state at turn 18+H-1 = 18+(t-18+1)-1 = t is (0,9) -> yes.\n\n  However, wait: at turn t, after taking the action 'S', we are at turn t+1 at 9. But we only care about turn t (18+H-1=t) -> at the beginning of turn t, we are at 9, and then we take 'S' and then at turn t+1 we are still at 9. But the condition is only for the beginning of turn t.\n\n  So it meets.\n\n  Therefore, we can do:\n\n      Use BFS over (y, t) for t>=18 and y in [0,9].\n      Start at (0,18).\n      For each state (y,t) that is safe, we consider the actions for turn t: which will determine y_{t+1} = y + delta.\n      We then check the safety of (y_{t+1}, t+1) only after we move? Actually, at state (y,t) we check safety at (y,t) (freeway y at turn t) if y in [1,8]. If safe, then we can take actions.\n\n      Then we compute next states.\n\n      We stop when we find (9, t) for any t.\n\n      Then H = t - 18 + 1.\n      The actions: the actions taken to get to (9,t) are the actions from turn 18 to turn t-1. Then for turn t, we action 'S'.\n\n      But note: we might have reached (9,t) and then we can output immediately. However, there might be a shorter H? \n\n      Actually, the BFS expands by increasing t.\n\n      We are to minimize H = t-18+1, which is minimized by minimize t.\n\n      So the first time we reach (9, t) for any t, we have the minimal H.\n\n  Therefore, we do BFS in terms of t.\n\n  Implementation:\n\n      Let's create a queue: each element (y, t, path) where path is the list of actions taken from turn 18 to turn current-1 (so for the current state at turn t, the last action in the path is for turn t-1)\n\n      We start: (0, 18, [])\n\n      While queue not empty:\n          pop (y, t, path)\n          if y==9: \n              Then we found a state (9,t). \n              H = t - 18 + 1\n              The actions = path + ['S']   # because for turn t, we will do 'S'. But wait, we haven't taken the action for turn t yet.\n\n          But note: at (y,t) = (9,t), we are at the goal at the beginning of turn t. Then we need to take an action for turn t to complete the sequence of H actions.\n\n          So the actions in the path are for turns 18 to t-1. We need to add one more action for turn t.\n\n          So the complete sequence = path + [a_t] where a_t can be 'S' (or 'D' or 'U'? but 'U' not possible, 'D' would go to 8, but then at turn t+1 we are at 8, but we only care about turn t). However, to avoid complexity, we choose 'S'.\n\n          Then output the sequence.\n\n          But note: we must also check that at turn t, if we are at (9,t) it is safe (which it is, because y=9 is safe) and then any action is safe.\n\n          So we return the actions = path + ['S'].\n\n      If not at goal, then for each action in ['U','D','S'] (if valid) for current y and next state y':\n          - if action is 'U' and y<9, then y' = y+1\n          - if 'D' and y>0, then y' = y-1\n          - if 'S', then y' = y\n\n          Then we need to check the safety of the next state (y', t+1) -> no, actually, the next state we will be at is (y', t+1), but we are about to leave the current state (y,t). We must check the current state (y,t) is safe.\n\n          So in the BFS, when we are at (y,t), we first ensure that if y in [1,8], then at turn t, the freeway y is safe (0 not in any car span on freeway y at turn t).\n\n          Then for each action, we generate (y', t+1) and then later when we pop (y', t+1) we will check its safety.\n\n      However, we can generate (y', t+1) and then at that state we will check safety.\n\n      But note: the current state (y,t) might be unsafe, so we should check it before even considering actions.\n\n      Therefore, in the BFS when we pop (y,t), we check safety of (y,t) (if y in [1,8] then check cars; if y in [0,9] then safe) -> if not safe, skip.\n\n      Then for each action, generate next state (y', t+1) and if we haven't visited (y', t+1) or found a better way, then push (y', t+1, path + [action]) and mark visited.\n\n      We must allow revisiting the same (y,t) with a different path if the path is shorter? But BFS by t (which is time) will have non-decreasing t. We might have different y at the same t, but the same (y,t) should not be visited again because the state is the same and we are BFS in time.\n\n      So we can use a visited set: states (y,t) with t increasing, so we might not need to revisit the same (y,t) because the time only moves forward.\n\n      Therefore, we can mark visited as (y,t).\n\n  Let's code accordingly.\n\n  But note: t can be large, but hopefully we find a solution within a reasonable time.\n\n  Now, we need a function safe(y, t) that returns whether at turn t, freeway y (if y in [1,8]) is safe.\n\n  For a given freeway y and turn t, we are given the cars at turn 18. We compute the spans at turn t.\n\n  How to compute for a car (head, tail, direction, speed) on freeway y:\n\n      Let dt = t - 18.\n\n      if direction == 'right':\n          new_tail = tail + speed * dt\n          new_head = head + speed * dt\n          span = (new_tail, new_head)   # and then we check if 0 is in [new_tail, new_head] (inclusive)\n\n      if direction == 'left': # but in our data, all are 'right'? \n          new_head = head - speed * dt   # because head is the right end initially, and moves left\n          new_tail = tail - speed * dt\n          span = (new_tail, new_head) -> but wait, for left-moving, the representation: at time 18, the span is [head, tail] (with head>tail) -> but the update: becomes [ head - speed*dt, tail - speed*dt ] and since head>tail, then head-speed*dt > tail-speed*dt, so the span is [tail-speed*dt, head-speed*dt]? \n\n          However, the problem says for left-moving: \n              initial: [h, tau] -> becomes [ h - s*dt, tau - s*dt ]\n          and note: in the initial for left-moving, the head is at h and tail at tau, and h > tau? Actually, the problem doesn't specify. But typically for left-moving, head is the left end? or the front is left. \n\n          Given the data: in freeway 1 to 8, all are 'right'. So we don't have 'left'. So we can skip.\n\n  In the given data, every car is 'right'. So we only worry about right-moving.\n\n  For a car (head, tail, 'right', speed) at time 18, at time t:\n      new_tail = tail + speed * (t-18)\n      new_head = head + speed * (t-18)\n\n  then if new_tail <= 0 <= new_head, then there is a collision.\n\n  But note: the span is [new_tail, new_head] and we use real numbers, so if the car covers 0, then collision.\n\n  Example: car (-48,-59,right,4) at time 18: \n      new_tail = -59 + 4*(t-18)\n      new_head = -48 + 4*(t-18)\n\n      We require: -59+4*(t-18) <= 0 <= -48+4*(t-18)\n\n      Solve: \n          -59+4*(t-18) <= 0 -> 4*(t-18) <= 59 -> t-18 <= 59/4 = 14.75 -> t<=32.75 -> t<=32\n          0 <= -48+4*(t-18) -> 48<=4*(t-18) -> 12<=t-18 -> t>=30\n\n      So for t in [30,32] (inclusive) this car covers 0.\n\n  Similarly for other cars.\n\n  We must check for any car on the freeway, if any car has new_tail<=0<=new_head then unsafe.\n\n  If no car covers 0, then safe.\n\n  Implementation for safe(y, t):\n      if y==0 or y==9: return True\n      else:\n          get the list of cars for freeway y.\n          for each car in the list: (head, tail, d, s)  [d is 'right' for all]\n             if d!='right': # not in our data, but for safety\n                 continue # or process 'left' if needed, but data has only 'right'\n             dt = t - 18\n             new_tail = tail + s * dt\n             new_head = head + s * dt\n             # Note: at time 18, the car is [tail, head] (and tail<=head) -> and then moves to [new_tail, new_head] and new_tail<=new_head.\n             if new_tail <= 0 <= new_head:\n                 return False\n          return True\n\n  But note: the representation in the given data might have head and tail such that head>=tail? \n      Example: freeway 1: first car: head=-48, tail=-59 -> head>tail? \n      But -48 > -59, so head>tail. Then new_head = -48+4*dt, new_tail=-59+4*dt, and new_head>new_tail.\n\n  So the condition new_tail<=0<=new_head is well-defined.\n\n  However, if the car is moving and the span might be [new_tail, new_head] with new_tail<=new_head.\n\n  Now, we BFS:\n\n      Let's initialize: \n          queue: collections.deque([(0,18,[])]   # (y, t, actions_so_far) actions_so_far is the actions for turns 18 to current-1\n          visited = set((0,18))\n\n      We are at (0,18): safe because y=0.\n\n      Then we consider actions: \n          U: y'=1, t'=19\n          S: y'=0, t'=19\n          D: invalid.\n\n      For (1,19): check safe(1,19)? \n          freeway1 at turn19: dt=1\n          car1: new_tail = -59+4*1 = -55, new_head = -48+4= -44 -> -55<=0<=-44? -> 0 is not in [-55,-44] -> safe.\n          car2: -23+4= -19, -12+4= -8 -> [-19,-8] -> 0 not in it.\n          car3: 13+4=17, 24+4=28 -> [17,28] -> 0 not in it.\n          so safe.\n\n      For (0,19): safe.\n\n      We push (1,19,['U']) and (0,19,['S'])\n\n      Then from (1,19): \n          actions: U, D, S -> y' in [2,0,1]\n          check safety of next state: actually, we will check when we pop them.\n\n      We continue until we find (9, t) for some t.\n\n  Given the minimal H, we should find it quickly.\n\n  Let's hope that we can reach 9 in a few turns.\n\n  Note: the minimal number of actions (ignoring cars) is 9 actions (U 9 times). But with cars, it might take more if we have to wait.\n\n  We will BFS and find the minimal t for which (9,t) is reached.\n\n  We are to minimize H = t-18+1, which is equivalent to minimizing t.\n\n  So we want the smallest t such that we can be at 9 at the beginning of turn t.\n\n  We'll do BFS by increasing t.\n\n  Given the cars move with speeds between 3 and 24, they will eventually move out of the way, so it is solvable.\n\n  Let's start the BFS.\n\n  We will do it by hand for the first few turns? or we trust the code.\n\n  Since this is a text-based response, I will try to compute the safe conditions for freeways 1 to 8 for a range of turns.\n\n  But note: t starts at 18 and increases.\n\n  Alternatively, we can simulate until we find the goal.\n\n  Given the complexity, I will write a in-memory BFS.\n\n  Given the constraints on t, we hope to find a solution within t up to 50 or so.\n\n  We'll BFS until we find (9,t).\n\n  Steps in code (not run, but we can simulate by hand for the first few):\n\n  We'll create a table for the safety of freeways 1 to 8 for turns 18 to, say, 30.\n\n  Freeway 1:\n      cars: \n          c1: (-59,-48,4) -> [ -59+4*(t-18), -48+4*(t-18) ]\n          c2: (-23,-12,4) -> [ -23+4*(t-18), -12+4*(t-18) ]\n          c3: (13,24,4) -> [13+4*(t-18), 24+4*(t-18)]\n\n      Check for 0 in any span.\n\n      c1: 0 in [-59+4*dt, -48+4*dt] -> \n          -59+4*dt <= 0 <= -48+4*dt\n          => 59/4>= dt >= 48/4=12 -> dt in [12, 14.75] -> integer dt: 12,13,14 -> turns: 18+12=30, 31, 32.\n      c2: 0 in [-23+4*dt, -12+4*dt] -> \n          -23+4*dt<=0<=-12+4*dt -> \n          dt>= 23/4=5.75 -> dt>=6, and dt<=12/4=3 -> contradiction.

Can we then at turn21: U to3 (which is unsafe at turn21? no, freeway3 is unsafe at22,23. At turn21, freeway3 is safe. \n      turn20: at2.\n      turn21: U to3 -> then at turn21: freeway3 is safe (because unsafe at22,23). \n      turn22: we cannot stay at3 (unsafe) and we cannot go to4 (unsafe). \n            So we must leave freeway3 and freeway4: the only option is to go back to2.\n            So at turn22: D to2.\n      turn23: then we are at2. Then we can go up to3 at24.\n\n      Then:\n        turn18: U\n        turn19: U\n        turn20: U  // to2 at21? \n        Actually:\n          18: U ->1 at19\n          19: U ->2 at20\n          20: U ->3 at21\n          21: D ->2 at22\n          22: U ->3 at23  [but freeway3 at23 is unsafe!] -> so we cannot do this.\n\n      Alternatively, at turn22: not U but wait at2.\n        turn22: S at2.\n        turn23: U to3 at24 (safe) -> then same as before.\n\n      This is the same as our first path: it takes the same number of steps.\n\n  Or we could at turn20: not go to3, but wait at2 for one turn and then go up.\n\n      turn18: U to1 at19\n      turn19: U to2 at20\n      turn20: S to2 at21  [instead of U]\n      turn21: U to3 at22 -> but freeway3 at22 is unsafe -> not allowed.\n\n  So we must avoid freeway3 at22 and freeway4 at22,23.\n\n  Therefore, the path we have is the fastest.\n\n  So the answer: 13 actions.\n\n  The actions per turn:\n\n      turn18: U\n      turn19: U\n      turn20: U\n      turn21: D\n      turn22: S\n      turn23: U\n      turn24: U\n      turn25: U\n      turn26: U\n      turn27: U\n      turn28: U\n      turn29: U\n      turn30: S\n\n  But wait, the actions for turn30 is the 13th action, and the turns are from 18 to 18+13-1=30.\n\n  So the output should be:\n\n      Turn 18: U\n      Turn 19: U\n      Turn 20: U\n      Turn 21: D\n      Turn 22: S\n      Turn 23: U\n      Turn 24: U\n      Turn 25: U\n      Turn 26: U\n      Turn 27: U\n      Turn 28: U\n      Turn 29: U\n      Turn 30: S\n\n  But note: the problem says the sequence is for turns 18 to 18+13-1=30, so 13 actions.\n\n  However, in the output format, we only list actions for turns 18 to 30, but the last action is at turn30.\n\n  But the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" so for H=13, t=0 to 12: turns 18 to 30.\n\n  Therefore, we output:\n\n      Turn 18: U\n      Turn 19: U\n      Turn 20: U\n      Turn 21: D\n      Turn 22: S\n      Turn 23: U\n      Turn 24: U\n      Turn 25: U\n      Turn 26: U\n      Turn 27: U\n      Turn 28: U\n      Turn 29: U\n      Turn 30: S\n\n  But wait, the last action is at turn30 and then at turn31 we are at9. But the problem requires that at turn30 (which is 18+13-1=30) we are at (0,9). \n\n  How are we at (0,9) at turn30? \n\n      At the beginning of turn30, we are at y from the action at turn29: which was U from 8 to9. So at the beginning of turn30, we are at9. \n      Then we take action S at turn30, and then at turn31 we are still at9. \n\n  So at the beginning of turn30, we are at9. Therefore, condition met.\n\n  But the action at turn30 is taken while we are at9, and it doesn't move us away.\n\n  So it is correct.\n\n  Therefore, the answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 18\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\) is \\(H = 13\\). The sequence of actions is determined as follows:\n\n- At turn 18, the player moves up (U) to position \\(y = 1\\).\n- At turn 19, the player moves up (U) to position \\(y = 2\\).\n- At turn 20, the player moves up (U) to position \\(y = 3\\).\n- At turn 21, the player moves down (D) to position \\(y = 2\\) to avoid an unsafe condition on freeway 3 at turn 22.\n- At turn 22, the player stays (S) at position \\(y = 2\\) to avoid unsafe conditions on freeways 3 and 4.\n- At turn 23, the player moves up (U) to position \\(y = 3\\) (now safe).\n- From turns 24 to 29, the player moves up (U) consecutively, reaching \\(y = 9\\) at turn 30.\n- At turn 30, the player stays (S) to remain at \\(y = 9\\), satisfying the goal at turn 30 (which is \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 18 + 13 - 1 = 30\\)).\n\nThe sequence of actions is:\n\n```\nTurn 18: U\nTurn 19: U\nTurn 20: U\nTurn 21: D\nTurn 22: S\nTurn 23: U\nTurn 24: U\nTurn 25: U\nTurn 26: U\nTurn 27: U\nTurn 28: U\nTurn 29: U\nTurn 30: S\n```\n\n\\boxed{\\text{Turn 18: U \\\\ Turn 19: U \\\\ Turn 20: U \\\\ Turn 21: D \\\\ Turn 22: S \\\\ Turn 23: U \\\\ Turn 24: U \\\\ Turn 25: U \\\\ Turn 26: U \\\\ Turn 27: U \\\\ Turn 28: U \\\\ Turn 29: U \\\\ Turn 30: S}}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible without colliding with any cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. The cars are moving, and I have to avoid being on a freeway when a car is at position 0 at that turn.\n\nFirst, I should understand the car positions over time. Since all cars are moving right with positive speeds, their positions increase over time. The span for right-moving cars is given by [tail + s*(T-t1), head + s*(T-t1)] for turn T, where t1 is the current turn, which is 22.\n\nLet me denote the current turn as t0 = 22.\n\nFor each freeway and each car, I need to find when the car spans include 0, because that's when I should avoid that freeway.\n\nCollision occurs if at turn T, I am on freeway y_T, and for some car on that freeway, 0 is in the span at turn T.\n\nThe player position is updated after the action, so at turn T, after action a_T, y_{T+1} is set. But for collision, it's based on y_T at turn T.\n\nLet me read carefully.\n\n\"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nSo, at turn T, you are on freeway y_T. After action a_T, you move to y_{T+1}, but at turn T, you are still on y_T.\n\nFor collision at turn T, it depends on y_T and the cars on that freeway at turn T.\n\nNow, the car spans are given at turn t1=22, and we can compute for T >= t1.\n\nLet me list all cars for each freeway.\n\nFreeway 1: three cars\n\nCar A: h=-48, tau=-59, d=right, s=4\n\nSince right-moving, span at t1=22: [tau, h] = [-59, -48]? No.\n\nThe notation: \"Span(t1) = [tau, h] for right-moving\" but in the table it says (head h, tail tau, direction d, speed s)\n\nFor right-moving, head is greater than tail, I think.\n\nIn the car state: for freeway 1, (-48, -59, right, 4)\n\nI think the first number is head, second is tail.\n\nBut for right-moving, head should be larger than tail, but -48 > -59, yes, -48 is larger than -59.\n\n-48 > -59, so head h = -48, tail tau = -59.\n\nAt turn t1, span is [tau, h] = [-59, -48]? But typically, for right-moving, it should be [tail, head] with tail < head.\n\nIn the update: for right-moving, Span(T) = [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nSimilarly for left, but all here are right-moving.\n\nSo for car on freeway 1: h=-48, tau=-59, s=4, right.\n\nAt turn T, span = [tau + s*(T-22), h + s*(T-22)] = [-59 + 4*(T-22), -48 + 4*(T-22)]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\n0 in span means that the car covers position 0 at that turn.\n\nSo for collision on freeway k at turn T, if 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway at T.\n\nI need to find for each freeway, the times when it is occupied, i.e., when 0 is covered by some car.\n\nThen, when I am on a freeway at turn T, it must not be occupied at that turn.\n\nI start at y=0 at turn t1=22.\n\ny=0 is not a freeway; freeways are y=1 to 8. y=0 and y=9 are safe, I think, since no cars.\n\nThe player position is (0, y), and vertical axis y=0 to 9, and freeways y=1 to 8 have cars.\n\ny=0 and y=9 have no cars, so no collision possible there.\n\nThe goal is to reach (0,9), which is safe.\n\nI need to go from y=0 to y=9, moving through y=1 to 8, but only when those are not occupied at the time I'm on them.\n\nActions: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), S (stay, y same), but y constrained to [0,9], so I can't go below 0 or above 9.\n\nSince I start at y=0, and want to go to y=9, I probably only need U and S, but D might be needed to avoid collisions, but since I need to go up, D might not be efficient, but in some cases it could be to wait.\n\nBut since cars are moving, and I need min turns, I should go up as fast as possible, but avoiding occupied freeways.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway k, the set of turns T when it is occupied, i.e., when 0 is in some car's span at T.\n\nSince t1=22, let τ = T - 22, so time from now.\n\nLet τ be the offset, τ >=0.\n\nFor each car, at time τ, span for a car with tau, h, s:\n\n[tau + s*τ, h + s*τ] where τ = T - t1\n\n0 in span if tau + s*τ <= 0 <= h + s*τ\n\nSince for right-moving, tau <= h, so the span is from min to max.\n\ntau is tail, h is head, so for right-moving, tail < head, so span is [tail, head] at τ=0.\n\nAt τ, [tail + s*τ, head + s*τ]\n\n0 in span if tail + s*τ <= 0 <= head + s*τ\n\nWhich is equivalent to:\n\n0 <= head + s*τ and tail + s*τ <= 0\n\nSince tail + s*τ <= head + s*τ always.\n\nSo:\n\nFrom tail + s*τ <= 0: s*τ <= -tail, so τ <= -tail / s\n\nFrom 0 <= head + s*τ: s*τ >= -head, so τ >= -head / s\n\nSince s > 0.\n\nSo τ >= ceil( -head / s ) and τ <= floor( -tail / s )? Let's see.\n\ntail + s*τ <= 0 implies s*τ <= -tail, so τ <= ceil( -tail / s )? No.\n\nLet's think carefully.\n\ntail + s*τ <= 0 ⇒ s*τ <= -tail ⇒ τ <= floor( (-tail) / s ) only if -tail/s integer, but in general.\n\nSince τ integer, τ <= floor( -tail / s )\n\nSimilarly, 0 <= head + s*τ ⇒ s*τ >= -head ⇒ τ >= ceil( -head / s )\n\nAnd since the span includes both ends, I think, so 0 in [L,R] means L <= 0 <= R.\n\nSo for integer τ, the values where it holds.\n\nτ must satisfy:\n\nceil( -head / s ) <= τ <= floor( -tail / s )\n\nLet me define.\n\nSet L = ceil( -head / s )\n\nU = floor( -tail / s )\n\nThen τ from L to U inclusive, if L <= U.\n\nIf not, no occupancy from this car.\n\nBut for each car, and multiple cars per freeway, so for freeway, occupied if any car has 0 in span at that τ.\n\nτ here is offset from t1.\n\nNow for each freeway, I need the union over cars of these intervals.\n\nThen for each freeway, the set of τ when it is occupied.\n\nThen for the player, at turn T, with y_T, if y_T between 1 and 8, it must not be occupied at that τ.\n\nNow, let's compute for each freeway.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: k=1\n\nCars:\n\n1. h=-48, tau=-59, s=4, right\n\nhead = -48, tail = -59\n\nL1 = ceil( -head / s ) = ceil( 48 / 4 ) = ceil(12) =12\n\nU1 = floor( -tail / s ) = floor( 59 / 4 ) = floor(14.75) =14? -tail = -(-59) =59, tail=-59, so -tail = -(-59) =59\n\ns=4\n\nU = floor( -tail / s ) = floor( 59 / 4 ) = floor(14.75) =14\n\nL = ceil( -head / s ) = ceil( 48 / 4 ) = ceil(12) =12\n\nSo τ from 12 to 14 inclusive.\n\nτ >= ceil( -head/s ) = ceil(48/4)=12\n\nτ <= floor( -tail/s ) = floor(59/4)=14.75 floor is 14? floor(14.75)=14, yes.\n\nBut let's check: at τ=12, tail + s*τ = -59 + 4*12 = -59 + 48 = -11\n\nhead + s*τ = -48 + 48 =0\n\nSo span = [-11, 0], so 0 is included.\n\nAt τ=13, tail +4*13= -59+52= -7, head+52= -48+52=4, span [-7,4], 0 in.\n\nAt τ=14, tail+56= -59+56= -3, head+56= -48+56=8, span [-3,8], 0 in.\n\nAt τ=15, tail+60=1, head+60=12, span [1,12], 0 not <=12? 0<1, not in.\n\nτ=11: tail+44= -59+44= -15, head+44= -48+44= -4, span [-15,-4], 0 not in.\n\nSo τ=12,13,14.\n\nNow car 2 on freeway 1: (-12, -23, right, 4)\n\nh=-12, tau=-23, s=4\n\nL = ceil( -(-12)/4 ) = ceil(12/4) = ceil(3) =3\n\nU = floor( -(-23)/4 ) = floor(23/4) = floor(5.75) =5\n\n- head = -(-12) =12, s=4, ceil(12/4)=3\n\n- tail = -(-23)=23, floor(23/4)=5.75 floor 5\n\nCheck: τ=3, tail + sτ= -23+12= -11? sτ=4*3=12, tail=-23, -23+12= -11\n\nhead + sτ= -12+12=0, span [-11,0], 0 in.\n\nτ=4, tail+16= -23+16= -7, head+16=4, span [-7,4], 0 in.\n\nτ=5, tail+20= -23+20= -3, head+20=8, span [-3,8], 0 in.\n\nτ=6, tail+24=1, head+24=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nτ=2, tail+8= -23+8= -15, head+8= -12+8= -4, [-15,-4], 0 not in.\n\nSo τ=3,4,5\n\nCar 3 on freeway 1: (24, 13, right, 4)\n\nh=24, tau=13, s=4\n\nNow, L = ceil( -head/s ) = ceil( -24/4 ) = ceil(-6) = -6\n\nU = floor( -tail/s ) = floor( -13/4 ) = floor(-3.25) = -4? -3.25 floor is -4? floor is to lower integer.\n\n-3.25, floor is -4, since -4 < -3.25 < -3, floor is -4.\n\nBut τ >=0, so we only care τ>=0.\n\nL = ceil( -24/4 ) = ceil(-6) = -6\n\nU = floor( -13/4 ) = floor(-3.25) = -4\n\nNow, since U = -4 < 0, and L=-6, but τ>=0, so for τ>=0, the interval is empty because U<0.\n\nCheck: at τ=0, span [13,24], 0 not in.\n\nτ=1, [13+4,24+4]=[17,28], etc, all positive, never covers 0 since min is 13 at τ=0.\n\nSo no occupancy from this car.\n\nThus for freeway 1, occupied at τ from cars: car1 at 12,13,14; car2 at 3,4,5.\n\nSo occupied τ: 3,4,5,12,13,14\n\nτ=3,4,5 and 12,13,14.\n\nNow freeway 2: same as freeway 1, according to the table.\n\n\" | 2 | (-48, -59, right, 4), (-12, -23, right, 4), (24, 13, right, 4) | \"\n\nExactly same as freeway 1.

For all τ.\n\nNow freeway 7: k=7\n\nCar: (-48, -71, right, 24)\n\nh=-48, tau=-71, s=24, right\n\nL= ceil( -(-48)/24 ) = ceil(48/24) = ceil(2) =2\n\nU= floor( -(-71)/24 ) = floor(71/24) = floor(2.958) =2\n\nSo τ=2 only.\n\nAt τ=2, tail + sτ= -71 + 48= -23? sτ=24*2=48, tau=-71, -71+48= -23\n\nhead + sτ= -48+48=0, span [-23,0], 0 in.\n\nAt τ=1, tail+24= -71+24= -47, head+24= -48+24= -24, span [-47,-24], 0 not in.\n\nτ=3, tail+72= -71+72=1, head+72= -48+72=24, [1,24], 0 not in.\n\nSo occupied at τ=2.\n\nNow freeway 8: k=8\n\nSame as freeway 7: (-48, -71, right, 24), so occupied at τ=2.\n\nSummary of occupied times for each freeway, in terms of τ = T - t1 = T - 22\n\nFreeway 1: occupied τ=3,4,5,12,13,14\n\nFreeway 2: same as 1, τ=3,4,5,12,13,14\n\nFreeway 3: τ=4,5\n\nFreeway 4: τ=4,5\n\nFreeway 5: τ=2\n\nFreeway 6: never occupied\n\nFreeway 7: τ=2\n\nFreeway 8: τ=2\n\nFreeway 6 is always safe, no cars ever at 0.\n\nNow, I need to get from y=0 at τ=0 to y=9.\n\nAt each turn, I choose action U, D, or S, changing y.\n\ny starts at 0 at turn t1=22, which is τ=0.\n\nAfter action, y changes.\n\nThe turn: at turn T, y_T is the position.\n\nAt τ=0, T=22, y=0.\n\nAfter action a_{22}, y_{23} is set, and so on.\n\nCollision at turn T depends on y_T and the freeway state at T.\n\nFor example, at T=22, τ=0, y=0, which is not a freeway, so no collision possible, I think y=0 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=9 is safe.\n\nWhen I am on y=k for k=1 to 8, I need that at that turn, freeway k is not occupied.\n\nI need to find a sequence of actions to go from y=0 to y=9 in min turns.\n\nSince I start at y=0, and need to reach y=9, the minimal number of actions is 9, if I go up every turn, but I might need to wait or avoid.\n\nWith actions, each U increases y by 1, S keeps, D decreases, but since I need to go up, D might not be useful, but I can use S to wait.\n\nBut waiting might be necessary if freeways are occupied.\n\nNow, the occupied times:\n\nLet me list for each τ, which freeways are occupied.\n\nτ=0: T=22, all freeways: from above, no one occupied at τ=0? Let's see.\n\nFreeway 1: occupied τ=3,4,5,12,13,14 not 0\n\nFreeway 2: same\n\nFreeway 3: τ=4,5 not 0\n\nFreeway 4: same\n\nFreeway 5: τ=2 not 0\n\nFreeway 6: never\n\nFreeway 7: τ=2 not 0\n\nFreeway 8: τ=2 not 0\n\nSo at τ=0, all freeways are free? But y=0 is not freeway, but at τ=0, T=22, y=0, no collision.\n\nNow, I can move to y=1 at next turn.\n\nActions: at turn T, I choose action, which determines y_{T+1}.\n\nAt turn T, I am at y_T, I choose a_T, then y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy.\n\nThen at turn T, collision depends on y_T and cars at T.\n\nAt turn T+1, collision depends on y_{T+1} and cars at T+1.\n\nI need to ensure that for each turn, if y_T in 1-8, then freeway y_T not occupied at τ=T-22.\n\nNow, to minimize H, the number of turns from start to end.\n\nStart at τ=0, y=0.\n\nAfter H turns, I should be at y=9.\n\nThe sequence: from turn 22 to turn 22+H-1, actions a_{22} to a_{22+H-1}, and after H actions, y_{22+H} =9.\n\nDefine: at time τ, after τ actions, position y_{22+τ}.\n\nSet τ as the step number.\n\nAt τ=0: before any action, at turn 22, position y=0.\n\nAfter action a_{22}, at turn 23, position y_{23}, which is after first action.\n\nGenerally: after t actions, at turn 22+t, position y_{22+t}.\n\nThe collision is at each turn T=22+t for t>=0, position y_{22+t}, and if y_{22+t} between 1 and 8, must not be occupied at that turn, i.e., at τ=t.\n\nτ = T - t1 = T - 22, so for turn T, τ = T-22.\n\nAt turn T=22+t, τ=t.\n\nPosition y_{22+t}, if 1<= y_{22+t} <=8, then freeway y_{22+t} must not be occupied at τ=t.\n\nWe want to reach y_{22+H} =9 for some H.\n\ny_{22+H} =9 after H actions.\n\nThe actions are from a_{22} to a_{22+H-1}.\n\nNow, to minimize H.\n\nSince I need to go from 0 to 9, the minimal H is 9, if I go up every turn.\n\nBut I may need to wait if at some point I would be on an occupied freeway.\n\nWith H=9, I would be at y=t at turn 22+t, for t=0 to 9.\n\nAt τ=t, y=t.\n\nNow, for each t, when y=t between 1 and 8, need freeway t not occupied at τ=t.\n\nNow let's see for each t from 1 to 8, at τ=t, is freeway t occupied.\n\nt is both the y-position and τ offset.\n\nAt step τ, if y=τ, since starting from 0 and going up each time.\n\nBut I might not go up each time.\n\nFirst, let's check if going up each step works.\n\nSo for τ from 1 to 8, at τ, y=τ.\n\nNeed for each k=1 to 8, at τ=k, freeway k not occupied.\n\nNow check:\n\nFor k=1, at τ=1, freeway 1 occupied? From above, freeway 1 occupied at τ=3,4,5,12,13,14, not at τ=1. So ok.\n\nτ=1: freeway 1 not occupied, since occ at 3,4,5,etc not 1.\n\nSimilarly, k=2 at τ=2: freeway 2 occupied at τ=3,4,5,12,13,14, not τ=2. τ=2 not in {3,4,5,12,13,14}, so ok.\n\nk=3 at τ=3: freeway 3 occupied at τ=4,5, but not at τ=3. τ=3 not in {4,5}, so ok.\n\nk=4 at τ=4: freeway 4 occupied at τ=4 and 5. At τ=4, occupied. So collision if y=4 at τ=4.\n\nProblem.\n\nSimilarly, k=5 at τ=5: freeway 5 occupied at τ=2, not at τ=5, so ok? Freeway 5 occupied only at τ=2.\n\nk=6 at τ=6: freeway 6 never occupied, so ok.\n\nk=7 at τ=7: freeway 7 occupied at τ=2, not τ=7, ok.\n\nk=8 at τ=8: freeway 8 occupied at τ=2, not τ=8, ok.\n\nBut at k=4, τ=4, freeway 4 is occupied, so if I am at y=4 at turn T=22+4=26, τ=4, occupied, collision.\n\nSimilarly, for k=3 at τ=3, freeway 3 not occupied, ok.\n\nBut k=4 at τ=4 occupied.\n\nSo I cannot be on freeway 4 at τ=4.\n\nWith direct up, at τ=4, y=4, which is occupied.\n\nSo need to avoid that.\n\nPerhaps I can delay or something.\n\nMinimal H might be more than 9.\n\nI need to find a path where at each τ, when I am on y between 1 and 8, it is not occupied.\n\ny can be changed by actions.\n\nActions: U, D, S.\n\nSince I need to go up, D might not be useful, but I can use S to stay on a freeway or on y=0 or 9.\n\nBut y=0 and 9 are safe.\n\nNow, the critical points are the occupied times.\n\nLet me list the occupied freeways by τ:\n\nτ=2: freeways 5,7,8 occupied (and freeway 2? Freeway 2 at τ=2 not occupied, only 3,4,5,12,etc)\n\nAt τ=2: freeway 5 occ, freeway 7 occ, freeway 8 occ.\n\nFreeway 1 and 2 occ at τ=3,4,5,12,13,14\n\nFreeway 3 and 4 occ at τ=4,5\n\nFreeway 5 occ at τ=2\n\nFreeway 6 never\n\nFreeway 7 occ at τ=2\n\nFreeway 8 occ at τ=2\n\nτ=3: freeway 1,2 occ\n\nτ=4: freeway 1,2,3,4 occ\n\nτ=5: freeway 1,2,3,4 occ\n\nτ=12: freeway 1,2 occ\n\netc.\n\nBut for min H, we might not reach high τ, since we go to 9.\n\nNow, I need to get to y=9.\n\nSince freeway 6 is always safe, I can stay on it if needed.\n\nBut I need to go through.\n\nPossible to go up slowly or fast.\n\nSince at τ=4, freeway 4 is occupied, I should not be on y=4 at τ=4.\n\nSimilarly, at τ=2, freeways 5,7,8 occupied, so I should not be on y=5,7,8 at τ=2.\n\nBut at τ=2, if I am on y=2, for example, freeway 2 not occupied at τ=2, so ok.\n\nLet's plan the sequence.\n\nStart at τ=0, y=0.\n\nI need to choose actions.\n\nI should go up as fast as possible, but avoid being on occupied freeways at wrong time.\n\nFor example, at τ=4, I must not be on y=4, since freeway 4 occupied.\n\nSimilarly, at τ=5, freeway 4 occupied, so not on y=4.\n\nAt τ=4, freeway 3 also occupied, so not on y=3.\n\nAt τ=4, freeways 1,2,3,4 occupied.\n\nSo at τ=4, I cannot be on y=1,2,3,4.\n\nSimilarly at τ=5, cannot be on y=1,2,3,4.\n\nAt τ=3, freeways 1 and 2 occupied, so cannot be on y=1 or 2 at τ=3.\n\nAt τ=2, freeways 5,7,8 occupied, so cannot be on y=5,7,8 at τ=2.\n\nNow, at τ=0, y=0, safe.\n\nI can choose to go up or stay.\n\nIf I go up, at τ=1, y=1, and at τ=1, which freeways occupied? None at τ=1, as per earlier.\n\nτ=1: from above, no freeway occupied at τ=1.\n\nFreeway 1 occ at 3,4,5,etc not 1.\n\nSimilarly others, only specific τ.\n\nAt τ=1, all freeways free, since only occ at τ=2,3,4,5,12,etc.\n\nSo at τ=1, y=1 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, I can go to y=2 at τ=2.\n\nAt τ=2, y=2, freeway 2: occupied at τ=3,4,5, not τ=2, so safe.\n\nBut at τ=2, if I am on y=5,7,8, not safe, but I am at y=2.\n\nNow, from y=2 at τ=2, I can go up to y=3 at τ=3.\n\nAt τ=3, y=3, freeway 3: occupied at τ=4,5, not τ=3, so should be safe.\n\nFreeway 3 at τ=3 not occupied, yes.\n\nBut at τ=3, freeways 1 and 2 occupied, so if I were on y=1 or 2, not good, but I am on y=3.\n\nNow, at τ=3, y=3, safe.\n\nNext, if I go up to y=4 at τ=4.\n\nBut at τ=4, freeway 4 occupied, so if y=4 at τ=4, collision.\n\nProblem.\n\nSo I cannot go to y=4 at τ=4.\n\nI need to be not on y=4 at τ=4.\n\nSimilarly, I cannot be on y=3 at τ=4, since freeway 3 occupied.\n\nAt τ=4, cannot be on y=1,2,3,4.\n\nSimilarly at τ=5, cannot be on y=1,2,3,4.\n\nNow, at τ=3, I am at y=3, which is safe at τ=3.\n\nBut if I go up to y=4 at τ=4, not safe.\n\nSo I should not go up; I can stay on y=3 or go down, but going down might not help.\n\nSince freeway 6 is always safe, I can go to y=6 quickly or something.\n\nBut I need to reach y=9.\n\nAnother idea: at τ=3, instead of going up, I can stay on y=3 for one turn.\n\nAt τ=3, y=3, safe.\n\nIf I choose S, stay, then at τ=4, I am still at y=3.\n\nBut at τ=4, freeway 3 occupied, so if y=3 at τ=4, collision.\n\nNot good.\n\nIf I go down to y=2 at τ=4.\n\nAt τ=4, y=2, freeway 2 occupied at τ=4, since freeway 2 occ at τ=3,4,5, so occupied, collision.\n\nSimilarly, if I go to y=1 at τ=4, freeway 1 occupied, collision.\n\nOr y=4, occupied.\n\nSo at τ=4, I cannot be on y=1,2,3,4.\n\nI must be on y=0 or y=5 or above or y=6, etc.\n\ny=5 at τ=4: freeway 5 occupied only at τ=2, not at τ=4, so should be safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=6 always safe.\n\ny=7 at τ=4: freeway 7 occupied at τ=2, not τ=4, safe.\n\ny=8 at τ=4: freeway 8 occupied at τ=2, not τ=4, safe.\n\nSimilarly at τ=5, y=5,6,7,8 should be safe, since freeway 5 not occ at τ=5, etc.\n\nBut I am at τ=3, y=3.\n\nFrom y=3 at τ=3, I need to go to a safe position at τ=4.\n\nPossible actions: U to y=4, but at τ=4 y=4 occupied, not safe.\n\nD to y=2, but at τ=4 y=2 occupied, not safe.\n\nS to y=3, at τ=4 occupied, not safe.\n\nAll actions lead to collision at τ=4 if I stay on y=3 at τ=3.\n\nBut I need to move to a different y.\n\nAt τ=3, I am at y=3, after action, I go to y_{24} or something.\n\nAt turn T=22+τ, position y_{22+τ}.\n\nAt τ=3, T=25, y=3.\n\nI choose action a_{25}, then y_{26} = y_{25} + Δy.\n\ny_{26} is position at turn 26, τ=4.\n\nAt turn 26, τ=4, collision depends on y_{26} and freeway at τ=4.\n\nIf y_{26} in 1-8, must not occupied.\n\nIf I choose U, y_{26} =4, which is occupied at τ=4, collision.\n\nIf S, y_{26}=3, occupied.\n\nIf D, y_{26}=2, occupied.\n\nAll bad.\n\nBut y=0 or y=9 or y=5,6,7,8 might be safe, but I am at y=3, I can only go to y=2,3,4 with actions, since y between 0 and 9.\n\ny=3, actions: U to 4, D to 2, S to 3.\n\nAll of which are unsafe at τ=4.\n\nSo I cannot be at y=3 at τ=3, because from there, I must go to y=2,3, or 4 at τ=4, all occupied.\n\nTherefore, I must not be at y=3 at τ=3.\n\nSimilarly, I must not be at positions that force me into occupied zones.\n\nAt τ=3, I should not be on y=1,2,3, because:\n\nIf at τ=3 on y=1: actions to y=0,1,2 at τ=4. But at τ=4, y=1,2,3,4 occupied, so y=1 and 2 occupied, y=0 safe but I need to go up, and y=2 occupied.\n\nSimilarly, if on y=2 at τ=3, can go to y=1,2,3 at τ=4, all occupied except possibly y=1,2,3,4 all occupied.\n\nAt τ=4, y=1,2,3,4 all occupied.\n\nSo the only safe positions at τ=4 are y=0, y=5,6,7,8, or y=9.\n\ny=9 is goal.\n\nSimilarly at τ=5, y=1,2,3,4 occupied, so safe only y=0,5,6,7,8,9.\n\nBut at τ=3, if I am on y=0, for example.\n\nLet's start over.\n\nI need to avoid being on low y at τ=3 and τ=4.\n\nAt τ=0, y=0.\n\nI can go to y=1 at τ=1, safe.\n\nAt τ=1, y=1, safe.\n\nThen I can go to y=2 at τ=2, safe.\n\nAt τ=2, y=2, safe, since freeway 2 not occupied at τ=2.\n\nFrom here, if I go up to y=3 at τ=3, but at τ=3, y=3 is safe, but then I am stuck because at τ=4, I have to go to an occupied position.\n\nSo instead, at τ=2, y=2, I can choose to stay or go down or up.\n\nIf I go up to y=3, problem as above.\n\nIf I stay at y=2, then at τ=3, y=2, but at τ=3, freeway 2 occupied, so collision at τ=3.\n\nIf I go down to y=1 at τ=3, at τ=3, freeway 1 occupied, collision.\n\nSo at τ=2, if I am on y=2, all actions lead to collision either at τ=3 or τ=4.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- U to y=3 at τ=3: at τ=3, y=3, freeway 3 not occupied, so safe at τ=3, but then at τ=4, cannot move safely.\n\n- S to y=2 at τ=3: at τ=3, y=2, freeway 2 occupied, collision.\n\n- D to y=1 at τ=3: at τ=3, y=1, freeway 1 occupied, collision.\n\nSo indeed, if I am at y=2 at τ=2, I have a problem: either immediate collision at τ=3 if S or D, or at τ=4 if U.\n\nBut with U to y=3 at τ=3, I am safe at τ=3, but then at τ=4 I have no safe action.\n\nSo I must not be at y=2 at τ=2.\n\nSimilarly, I must not be at y=1 at τ=2 or earlier.\n\nLet's go back.\n\nAt τ=1, I am at y=1 (if I went up from y=0).\n\nAt τ=1, y=1, safe.\n\nFrom here, I can choose action for τ=2.\n\nIf I go U to y=2 at τ=2, but as above, problem.\n\nIf I go S, stay at y=1 at τ=2.\n\nAt τ=2, y=1, freeway 1 occupied? Freeway 1 occupied at τ=3,4,5, not τ=2. τ=2 not occupied, so at τ=2, y=1 is safe.\n\nThen at τ=2, y=1, I can choose action.\n\nIf I go U to y=2 at τ=3, but at τ=3, freeway 2 occupied, so y=2 at τ=3 collision.\n\nIf I go S to y=1 at τ=3, at τ=3 freeway 1 occupied, collision.\n\nIf I go D to y=0 at τ=3, y=0, safe, no freeway.\n\nBut then I am at y=0, and I need to go up later.\n\nFrom y=1 at τ=2, I can go D to y=0 at τ=3, safe.\n\nThen at τ=3, y=0, I can stay or go up.\n\nBut I need to go up eventually.\n\nSince freeway 6 is always safe, I can go directly to y=6 as fast as possible.\n\nFor example, from y=0 at τ=0, go U to y=1 at τ=1.\n\nThen at τ=1, y=1, go U to y=2 at τ=2.\n\nBut at τ=2, y=2 is safe, but then I have the problem at τ=3.\n\nFrom y=1 at τ=1, instead of going to y=2, I can go directly to higher y, but I can only change by 1 each turn.\n\nActions only change y by -1,0,1.\n\nSo I can't jump.\n\nAnother idea: at τ=0, I can stay at y=0 for some turns to avoid the critical times.\n\nFor example, stay at y=0 until after τ=4 or something.\n\nBut that might increase H.\n\nLet's list the dangerous times: τ=2,3,4,5.\n\nAt τ=2, freeways 5,7,8 occupied, so avoid y=5,7,8 at τ=2.\n\nAt τ=3, freeways 1,2 occupied, avoid y=1,2 at τ=3.\n\nAt τ=4, freeways 1,2,3,4 occupied, avoid y=1,2,3,4 at τ=4.\n\nAt τ=5, freeways 1,2,3,4 occupied, avoid y=1,2,3,4 at τ=5.\n\nAfter that, only occ at τ=12, etc, which is late, so we can reach y=9 before that.\n\nNow, to min H, I should go up as fast as possible except when forced to wait.\n\nBut I need to be at a position where at critical τ, I am safe.\n\nFor example, at τ=4, I need to be at y<=0 or y>=5.\n\ny<=0 only y=0, or y>=5.\n\nSimilarly at τ=5, same.\n\nAt τ=3, I need to be at y=0 or y=3 or y>=4? At τ=3, avoid y=1,2, so y=0 or y=3 or y=4,5,6,7,8.\n\nBut y=3 at τ=3 is safe, as freeway 3 not occupied.\n\ny=4 at τ=3: freeway 4 occupied at τ=4,5, not τ=3, so should be safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=5 at τ=3: freeway 5 occupied only at τ=2, not τ=3, safe.\n\netc.\n\nBut at τ=3, if I am on y=3, I can go to y=4 at τ=4, which is occupied, bad.\n\nSo even though y=3 is safe at τ=3, it leads to problem.\n\nSimilarly, if I am on y=4 at τ=3, I can go to y=5 at τ=4, which is safe, since freeway 5 not occupied at τ=4.\n\nLet's see.\n\nSuppose at τ=3, I am at y=4.\n\nThen at τ=3, y=4, freeway 4 not occupied at τ=3 (only at 4,5), so safe.\n\nThen I choose action for τ=4.\n\nIf I go U to y=5 at τ=4, y=5 at τ=4, freeway 5 not occupied at τ=4 (only at τ=2), so safe.\n\nSimilarly, I can go to y=6 at τ=5, etc.\n\nBut how to get to y=4 at τ=3.\n\nFrom start, at τ=0, y=0.\n\nGo U to y=1 at τ=1.\n\nAt τ=1, y=1, go U to y=2 at τ=2.\n\nAt τ=2, y=2, freeway 2 not occupied at τ=2, safe.\n\nThen at τ=2, I choose action. If I go U to y=3 at τ=3, then as above, at τ=3 y=3 safe, but then at τ=4, if I go U to y=4, occupied.\n\nBut from y=3 at τ=3, I can go U to y=4 at τ=4, occupied, bad; or S to y=3 at τ=4, occupied; or D to y=2 at τ=4, occupied.\n\nAll bad.\n\nBut if at τ=2, y=2, instead of going to y=3, I go directly to y=4? But I can only change by 1, so not possible.\n\nAt τ=2, y=2, I can go U to y=3 at τ=3.\n\nBut then from y=3 at τ=3, I need to go to a safe position at τ=4.\n\nBut y=3,4,2 all occupied at τ=4, so no.\n\nUnless I can go to y=5 or something, but from y=3, I can only go to y=2,3,4.\n\nAll occupied at τ=4.\n\nSo impossible from y=3 at τ=3.\n\nTherefore, I must not be at y=3 at τ=3.\n\nSimilarly, I must not be at y=1 or 2 at τ=3, because from there, I go to occupied positions at τ=4.\n\nFor example, if at τ=3 on y=2, I can go to y=1,2,3 at τ=4, all occupied.\n\nSimilarly on y=1 at τ=3, go to y=0,1,2 at τ=4; y=1 and 2 occupied, only y=0 safe but down.\n\nOn y=4 at τ=3, I can go to y=5 at τ=4, which is safe.\n\nOr to y=3 or 4, occupied.\n\nBut y=5 is safe at τ=4.\n\nSimilarly, on y=0 at τ=3, I can go to y=1 at τ=4, but occupied, or y=0, safe, or y= -1 not possible.\n\ny=1 at τ=4 occupied.\n\nSo only y=0 safe at τ=4 from y=0.\n\nBut I need to go up.\n\nSo the key is to be at y=4 or higher at τ=3.\n\nFor example, at τ=3, be at y=4.\n\nThen at τ=4, go to y=5, safe.\n\nThen at τ=5, go to y=6, safe, and so on.\n\nHow to get to y=4 at τ=3 from start.\n\nAt τ=0, y=0.\n\nGo U to y=1 at τ=1.\n\nAt τ=1, y=1, go U to y=2 at τ=2.\n\nAt τ=2, y=2, now from here, to reach y=4 at τ=3, I need to go up twice, but I can only do one action per turn.\n\nAt τ=2, I am at y=2, after action, at τ=3, I can be at y=1,2, or 3, not 4.\n\nSo impossible to be at y=4 at τ=3 from this path.\n\nMax I can be is y=3 at τ=3.\n\nBut y=3 at τ=3 is problematic.\n\nPerhaps I can be at higher y earlier by starting faster, but I started at y=0, and at τ=0, I can only go to y=1 at τ=1, etc.\n\nUnless I stay at y=0 for some turns, but that would make me slower.\n\nFor example, at τ=0, stay at y=0.\n\nThen at τ=1, y=0, go U to y=1 at τ=2? At turn T, action determines y_{T+1}.\n\nAt τ=0, turn 22, y=0.\n\nI choose a_{22}, then y_{23} = y for τ=1.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nIf at τ=0, I choose S, stay, then at τ=1, y=0.\n\nThen at τ=1, I choose U, then at τ=2, y=1.\n\nThen at τ=2, I choose U, then at τ=3, y=2.\n\nThen at τ=3, I choose U, then at τ=4, y=3.\n\nBut at τ=4, y=3, freeway 3 occupied, collision.\n\nOr at τ=3, y=2, if I go U to y=3 at τ=4, occupied.\n\nStill problem.\n\nIf at τ=1, y=0, I go U to y=1 at τ=2.\n\nThen at τ=2, y=1, I can go U to y=2 at τ=3.\n\nAt τ=3, y=2, freeway 2 occupied, collision.\n\nOr go S to y=1 at τ=3, occupied, collision.\n\nOr go D to y=0 at τ=3, safe.\n\nThen at τ=3, y=0, I can go U to y=1 at τ=4, but at τ=4, y=1 occupied, collision.\n\nOr stay at y=0, safe, or go down, not useful.\n\nSo I can stay at y=0 at τ=4, safe, but not progressing.\n\nThen later, I can go up.\n\nBut let's see after τ=5.\n\nAfter τ=5, freeways are free except at τ=12, etc, which is far.\n\nFor example, at τ=6, I can be on any y.\n\nBut I need to reach y=9.\n\nTo min H, I should go up as fast as possible after the dangerous period.\n\nDangerous period from τ=2 to τ=5.\n\nAt τ=5, occupied y=1,2,3,4.\n\nSo at τ=5, I should be on y=0 or y=5,6,7,8.\n\nSimilarly at τ=4, same.\n\nAt τ=3, I should be on y=0 or y=3,4,5,6,7,8.\n\nBut from y=3 at τ=3, I can go to y=4 at τ=4, occupied, bad.\n\nSo better to be on y=4 or higher at τ=3.\n\nSince I can't reach y=4 at τ=3, I need to be on y=0 at τ=3 and τ=4, then go up after.\n\nFor example, stay at y=0 until τ=4.\n\nThen at τ=4, y=0, safe.\n\nThen I can go up.\n\nBut at τ=4, if I go U to y=1 at τ=5, but at τ=5, y=1, freeway 1 occupied, collision.\n\nIf I go U to y=1 at τ=5, occupied.\n\nSo I need to go to a higher y.\n\nAt τ=4, y=0, I can go U to y=1 at τ=5, occupied, not good.\n\nGo S to y=0 at τ=5, safe, but not progressing.\n\nGo D, not possible or not useful.\n\nSo I cannot go to y=1 at τ=5 because occupied.\n\nSimilarly, y=2,3,4 at τ=5 all occupied.\n\nSo at τ=5, I cannot be on y=1,2,3,4.\n\nI must be on y=0 or y=5,6,7,8 at τ=5.\n\nSimilarly at τ=4, must be on y=0 or y=5,6,7,8.\n\nBut at τ=4, if I am on y=0, I can go to y=1 at τ=5, but y=1 occupied at τ=5, not good.\n\nIf I go to y=0 at τ=5, safe.\n\nThen from there, I can go up later.\n\nBut let's go to freeway 6, which is always safe.\n\nSo, for example, at τ=4, I am at y=0.\n\nI can go U to y=1 at τ=5, but occupied, collision.\n\nNot possible.\n\nSo I must be at a position where I can jump over the occupied zones.\n\nSince freeway 5 is only occupied at τ=2, and freeway 6 always safe, etc.\n\nLet's list safe (y,τ) for y in 1-8.\n\nFor freeway 1: safe when τ not in {3,4,5,12,13,14}, so for τ=0,1,2,6,7,8,9,10,11,15,...\n\nFreeway 2: same as 1.\n\nFreeway 3: safe when τ not in {4,5}, so for τ=0,1,2,3,6,7,8,...\n\nFreeway 4: same as 3.\n\nFreeway 5: safe when τ not 2, so τ=0,1,3,4,5,6,...\n\nFreeway 6: always safe.\n\nFreeway 7: safe when τ not 2, so τ=0,1,3,4,5,6,...\n\nFreeway 8: safe when τ not 2, so τ=0,1,3,4,5,6,...\n\nFor the player, at each τ, the position y must be such that if y in 1-8, it is safe at that τ.\n\nNow, to go from y=0 at τ=0 to y=9 at some τ.\n\nThe number of actions is the number of U minus number of D, since each U +1, D -1, S 0, and net change from 0 to 9 is +9, so number of U minus number of D = 9.\n\nTo minimize turns, I should minimize the number of S and D, ideally only U, but may need S to wait.\n\nH is the number of turns from start to end.\n\nAfter H actions, y=9.\n\nThe position at each step.\n\nSince I need to be at high y at early τ to avoid the low y during occupied times.\n\nFor example, at τ=2, I can be on y=2, which is safe, but then I have the issue.\n\nAnother idea: at τ=1, I am at y=1.\n\nInstead of going to y=2 at τ=2, I can go directly to y=3? No, can't.\n\nOr stay at y=1 at τ=2.\n\nAt τ=2, y=1, freeway 1 not occupied at τ=2, so safe.\n\nThen at τ=2, y=1, I can go U to y=2 at τ=3, but at τ=3, y=2, freeway 2 occupied, collision.\n\nGo S to y=1 at τ=3, freeway 1 occupied, collision.\n\nGo D to y=0 at τ=3, safe.\n\nThen at τ=3, y=0.\n\nThen at τ=3, y=0, I can go U to y=1 at τ=4, but at τ=4, y=1 occupied, collision.\n\nGo S to y=0 at τ=4, safe.\n\nThen at τ=4, y=0, I can go U to y=1 at τ=5, but at τ=5, y=1 occupied, collision.\n\nGo S to y=0 at τ=5, safe.\n\nThen after that, at τ=6, I can start going up, since no occupation until τ=12.\n\nAt τ=6, y=0, go U to y=1 at τ=7.\n\nAt τ=7, y=1, go U to y=2 at τ=8, and so on, up to y=9 at τ=15.\n\nH would be 15 turns, from τ=0 to τ=15, y=9 at τ=15.\n\nBut this is slow, and I can do better by being on higher freeways earlier.\n\nFor example, since freeway 6 is always safe, I can go to y=6 as fast as possible and stay there or go up.\n\nBut how to get to y=6 fast.\n\nFrom start, at τ=0, y=0.\n\nGo U to y=1 at τ=1.\n\nAt τ=1, y=1, go U to y=2 at τ=2.\n\nAt τ=2, y=2, safe.\n\nBut from here, I can go U to y=3 at τ=3, safe, but then stuck.\n\nInstead, at τ=2, y=2, I can go U to y=3 at τ=3.\n\nThen at τ=3, y=3, but instead of going to y=4, I can go to y=4 only at τ=4, occupied.\n\nBut I can't.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=5 from y=3, but not directly.\n\nAnother thought: at τ=2, I am at y=2, I can choose to go down to y=1 at τ=3, but occupied, collision.\n\nNot good.\n\nOr stay, collision at τ=3.\n\nSo no.\n\nUnless I am at y=4 at τ=2.\n\nAt τ=2, y=4, freeway 4: occupied at τ=4,5, not at τ=2, so at τ=2, y=4 is safe.\n\nThen from y=4 at τ=2, I can go U to y=5 at τ=3.\n\nAt τ=3, y=5, freeway 5 occupied only at τ=2, not τ=3, so safe.\n\nThen at τ=3, y=5, I can go U to y=6 at τ=4.\n\nAt τ=4, y=6, freeway 6 always safe, so safe.\n\nThen at τ=4, y=6, go U to y=7 at τ=5.\n\nAt τ=5, y=7, freeway 7 occupied at τ=2, not τ=5, safe.\n\nGo U to y=8 at τ=6, then to y=9 at τ=7.\n\nSo H=7 turns, reach y=9 at τ=7.\n\nBut how to get to y=4 at τ=2.\n\nAt τ=0, y=0, go U to y=1 at τ=1.\n\nAt τ=1, y=1, go U to y=2 at τ=2? At τ=1, if I go U, to y=2 at τ=2.\n\nBut to be at y=4 at τ=2, I need to be at y=4 at turn 24, τ=2.\n\nFrom y=0 at τ=0, after two actions, at τ=2, I can be at y=2 max, if I go U twice.\n\ny=0 -> U to y=1 at τ=1 -> U to y=2 at τ=2.\n\nSo y=2 at τ=2, not y=4.\n\nImpossible to be at y=4 at τ=2.\n\nSo this path is not possible.\n\nI need to start earlier, but I start at τ=0 y=0.\n\nPerhaps stay at y=0 for some turns, but that makes y lower.\n\nFor example, at τ=0, stay at y=0, then at τ=1, y=0, go U to y=1 at τ=2.\n\nThen at τ=2, y=1, go U to y=2 at τ=3, but at τ=3, y=2 occupied, collision.\n\nNot good.\n\nAt τ=1, y=0, go U to y=1 at τ=2.\n\nThen at τ=2, y=1, I can go U to y=2 at τ=3, collision, or S to y=1 at τ=3, collision, or D to y=0 at τ=3, safe.\n\nThen at τ=3, y=0.\n\nThen at τ=3, y=0, go U to y=1 at τ=4, but at τ=4, y=1 occupied, collision.\n\nGo S to y=0 at τ=4, safe.\n\nThen at τ=4, y=0, go U to y=1 at τ=5, at τ=5, y=1 occupied, collision.\n\nSo I have to stay at y=0 until τ=6 or something.\n\nAt τ=4, y=0, if I go S to y=0 at τ=5, safe.\n\nAt τ=5, y=0, go U to y=1 at τ=6.\n\nAt τ=6, y=1, freeway 1 not occupied (occ at 3,4,5,12, not 6), so safe.\n\nGo U to y=2 at τ=7, safe.\n\nU to y=3 at τ=8, safe.\n\nU to y=4 at τ=9, safe.\n\nU to y=5 at τ=10, safe.\n\nU to y=6 at τ=11, safe.\n\nU to y=7 at τ=12, but at τ=12, freeway 7 not occupied? Freeway 7 occupied only at τ=2, not 12, so safe.\n\nFreeway 7 occ only τ=2.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 1 occ at τ=12, but at τ=12, if I am on y=7, freeway 7 not occ, so ok.\n\nGo U to y=8 at τ=13.\n\nU to y=9 at τ=14.\n\nSo at τ=14, y=9.\n\nH=14 turns from start.\n\nBut earlier I thought of being on y=6 faster.\n\nSince freeway 6 is always safe, I can go to y=6 at some point and stay, but I need to reach it.\n\nFrom the above, at τ=6, I am at y=0, go U to y=1 at τ=7, etc, so at τ=11, y=5, then U to y=6 at τ=12.\n\nBut at τ=12, freeway 6 safe, so ok.\n\nBut I can reach y=6 earlier if I can.\n\nFor example, at τ=2, if I were at y=6, I can stay or go up.\n\nBut how to get to y=6 at τ=2.\n\nImpossible, since from y=0, in 2 steps, max y=2.\n\nSo not possible.\n\nMinimal H is at least 9, but with waiting, it might be more.\n\nAnother idea: go up to y=2 at τ=2, but then at τ=2, instead of going to y=3, go down to y=1 at τ=3, but at τ=3, y=1 occupied, collision.\n\nNot good.\n\nOr at τ=1, stay at y=1 for one turn.\n\nAt τ=0, U to y=1 at τ=1.\n\nAt τ=1, y=1, choose S, stay at y=1 at τ=2.\n\nAt τ=2, y=1, freeway 1 not occupied at τ=2, safe.\n\nThen at τ=2, y=1, I can go U to y=2 at τ=3, but at τ=3, y=2 occupied, collision.\n\nGo S to y=1 at τ=3, occupied, collision.\n\nGo D to y=0 at τ=3, safe.\n\nThen at τ=3, y=0, then as before, I can go U to y=1 at τ=4, occupied, collision, or stay.\n\nSo I have to stay at y=0 for several turns.\n\nThe earliest I can start going up is after τ=5.\n\nAt τ=5, I can be at y=0.\n\nThen at τ=5, go U to y=1 at τ=6, as above.\n\nBut at τ=6, I can be at higher y if I was at higher position earlier, but I was at y=0.\n\nFor example, if at τ=0, I go U to y=1 at τ=1.\n\nThen at τ=1, go D to y=0 at τ=2, for example.\n\nAt τ=1, y=1, choose D, then at τ=2, y=0.\n\nThen at τ=2, y=0, safe.\n\nThen I can stay or go up.\n\nAt τ=2, y=0, go U to y=1 at τ=3, but at τ=3, y=1 occupied, collision.\n\nGo S to y=0 at τ=3, safe.\n\nThen at τ=3, y=0, go S to y=0 at τ=4, safe.\n\nAt τ=4, y=0, go S to y=0 at τ=5, safe.\n\nThen at τ=5, y=0, go U to y=1 at τ=6, safe, and so on as before.\n\nSame as above.\n\nTo save time, at τ=2, y=0, I can go U to y=1 at τ=3, but occupied, not possible.\n\nSo I have to wait until τ=6 to go up.\n\nThen from y=0 at τ=5, go U at τ=6 to y=1, then U each turn to y=9 at τ=14.\n\nH=14.\n\nBut let's confirm the turns.\n\nStart at turn 22, τ=0, y=0.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn 22+H, position y=9.\n\nActions from a22 to a_{22+H-1}.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn 22+H, y=9.\n\nIn the sequence, with waiting:\n\nFor example, stay at y=0 for 5 turns: from τ=0 to τ=5, y=0.\n\nThen at τ=5, go U to y=1 at τ=6.\n\nThen U to y=2 at τ=7.\n\nU to y=3 at τ=8.\n\nU to y=4 at τ=9.\n\nU to y=5 at τ=10.\n\nU to y=6 at τ=11.\n\nU to y=7 at τ=12.\n\nU to y=8 at τ=13.\n\nU to y=9 at τ=14.\n\nSo at τ=14, y=9, after 14 actions.\n\nTurns: from turn 22 to turn 22+14=36, position y=9.\n\nNumber of actions H=14.\n\nBut is there a faster way?\n\nPerhaps I can be on y=5 at τ=5, for example.\n\nAt τ=5, y=5, freeway 5 not occupied at τ=5 (only at τ=2), so safe.\n\nThen from y=5 at τ=5, I can go U to y=6 at τ=6, etc, to y=9 at τ=9.\n\nBut how to get to y=5 at τ=5.\n\nFrom start, in 5 steps, I can be at y=5 if I go U all the time, but at τ=2, y=2, but then at τ=3, if y=3, safe, but then at τ=4, y=4 occupied, cannot.\n\nIf I go up with delays.\n\nSuppose at τ=0, U to y=1 at τ=1.\n\nAt τ=1, U to y=2 at τ=2.\n\nAt τ=2, y=2, now I cannot go up because at τ=3, if I go to y=3, safe, but then at τ=4, I have to go to occupied position.\n\nSo I must go down or stay, but both cause collision at τ=3 if I stay or go to y=1 or2.\n\nAt τ=2, y=2, only safe action is D to y=1 at τ=3, but occupied, or S to y=2 at τ=3, occupied, both collision.\n\nU to y=3 at τ=3, no collision at τ=3, but then at τ=4, collision.\n\nSo no way to avoid collision or waiting.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=6 at τ=4.\n\nAt τ=4, y=6, safe, since freeway 6 always safe.\n\nThen from there, go U to y=7 at τ=5, safe, etc.\n\nHow to get to y=6 at τ=4.\n\nFrom y=0 at τ=0, in 4 steps, to y=6.\n\nNet change +6 in 4 steps, so possible with 6 U and 0 D, but 6 actions in 4 steps? No.\n\nAfter 4 actions, at τ=4, position y.\n\nFrom y=0, after 4 actions, y can be from 0 to 4, since each action changes by at most 1.\n\nMax y=4 at τ=4 if U all.\n\nBut at τ=4, y=4 occupied, collision.\n\nMin y=0 if S or D.\n\nBut y=6 impossible at τ=4.\n\nSo cannot.\n\nTherefore, the only way is to stay at y=0 during the dangerous period and go up after.\n\nThe dangerous period ends at τ=5.\n\nAt τ=6, all freeways are free until τ=12.\n\nSo I can go up from τ=6 to τ=14 as above.\n\nH=14.\n\nBut let's see if I can start going up earlier.\n\nFor example, at τ=3, if I am on y=0, I can go to y=1 at τ=4, but occupied, not possible.\n\nAt τ=4, on y=0, go to y=1 at τ=5, occupied, not possible.\n\nSo I cannot be on y=1 to 4 at τ=4 and τ=5.\n\nThe first safe turn to be on y=1 is τ=6.\n\nSimilarly for other low y.\n\nBut for y=5, at τ=4, freeway 5 not occupied, so I can be on y=5 at τ=4.\n\nSimilarly at τ=5, y=5 safe.\n\nHow to get to y=5 at τ=4.\n\nFrom start, in 4 steps, max y=4, not 5.\n\nAt τ=4, y<=4.\n\ny=5 impossible.\n\nSimilarly, y=6 at τ=4 impossible.\n\nSo I must be on y<=4 at τ=4, but if y in 1-4, occupied at τ=4, so only y=0 safe at τ=4.\n\nSimilarly at τ=5, only y=0 or y=5,6,7,8 safe, but I am at y=0 at τ=4, so at τ=5, I can be at y=0 or y=1, but y=1 occupied, so only y=0 safe.\n\nThen at τ=6, I can go to y=1, safe.\n\nSo no choice, H=14.\n\nBut let's check the car at τ=12, but I reach y=9 at τ=14, before τ=12, so no problem.\n\nτ=12 is at T=34, I am at τ=14 T=36, but freeway occupation at τ=12, but I am on y=8 or 9 at that time.\n\nIn the path, at τ=12, I am at y=7 if going up from τ=6.\n\nFrom τ=6 y=1, τ=7 y=2, τ=8 y=3, τ=9 y=4, τ=10 y=5, τ=11 y=6, τ=12 y=7.\n\nAt τ=12, y=7, freeway 7 occupied only at τ=2, not 12, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 1 occupied at τ=12, but I am on y=7, not y=1.\n\nSo ok.\n\nThen τ=13 y=8, freeway 8 safe.\n\nτ=14 y=9.\n\nSo H=14.\n\nBut is there a way with H<14?\n\nFor example, if I can be on y=5 at τ=5.\n\nAt τ=5, y=5, safe.\n\nThen to y=9 at τ=9, H=9.\n\nBut how to get to y=5 at τ=5.\n\nFrom start, go U each turn, but at τ=4, y=4 occupied, collision.\n\nIf I go up but skip some occupied, but I can't skip positions.\n\nAnother idea: go down to y=0 at some point to avoid, but then I lose progress.\n\nFor example, at τ=0, U to y=1 at τ=1.\n\nAt τ=1, U to y=2 at τ=2.\n\nAt τ=2, D to y=1 at τ=3, but at τ=3, y=1 occupied, collision.\n\nNot good.\n\nAt τ=1, S to y=1 at τ=2.\n\nAt τ=2, y=1, then D to y=0 at τ=3, safe.\n\nThen at τ=3, y=0, S to y=0 at τ=4.\n\nS to y=0 at τ=5.\n\nThen at τ=5, U to y=1 at τ=6, same as before.\n\nNo gain.\n\nPerhaps from y=2 at τ=2, I go U to y=3 at τ=3, safe at τ=3, then at τ=3, I go U to y=4 at τ=4, but occupied, collision, so I die.\n\nSo I think it's impossible to avoid waiting, so H=14 is the minimal.\n\nBut let's confirm with the car states.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 4, at τ=4, it is occupied, but let's double-check the time.\n\nCurrent turn t1=22.\n\nFreeway 4 cars: (48,37,right,6), (12,1,right,6), (-24,-35,right,6)\n\nFor the third car: h=-24, tau=-35, s=6\n\nAt τ= T-22, span at T: [tau + sτ, h + sτ] = [-35 +6τ, -24 +6τ]\n\n0 in span if -35+6τ <= 0 <= -24+6τ\n\nSo 6τ <= 35 and 6τ >=24, so τ <= 35/6≈5.833, τ >=4\n\nSince τ integer, τ=4,5,6? τ=4: -35+24= -11, -24+24=0, so 0 in.\n\nτ=5: -35+30= -5, -24+30=6, 0 in.\n\nτ=6: -35+36=1, -24+36=12, 1 to 12, 0 not in.\n\nτ=3: -35+18= -17, -24+18= -6, -17 to -6, 0 not in.\n\nSo τ=4,5.\n\nSimilarly, other cars on freeway 4 don't cover 0.\n\nSo yes.\n\nNow, for the player, to reach y=9, with the constraints, minimal H is 14.\n\nBut in the sequence, with actions.\n\nStart at turn 22, y=0.\n\nI need to stay at y=0 for the first 6 turns? Let's see.\n\nAt turn 22 (τ=0), I choose S, stay at y=0 for turn 23? Turn 22: position y=0, choose action.\n\nAfter action, position at next turn.\n\nAt turn 22, I choose a_{22}, then position at turn 23 is y_{23}.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nTo stay at y=0, I need to choose S at each turn until I decide to move.\n\nFor example, from turn 22 to turn 26, I choose S, so at turn 23,24,25,26, position y=0.\n\nTurn 22: action a22, after that, at turn 23, position.\n\nIf I choose S at turn 22, then at turn 23, position y=0.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 23, choose S, at turn 24 y=0.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nAfter k actions, at turn 22+k, position.\n\nTo be at y=0 from τ=0 to τ=5, that is from turn 22 to turn 27.\n\nτ=0: turn 22\n\nτ=1: turn 23\n\nτ=2: turn 24\n\nτ=3: turn 25\n\nτ=4: turn 26\n\nτ=5: turn 27\n\nAt turn 27, τ=5, position y=0.\n\nThen at turn 27, I choose U, so at turn 28, position y=1, which is τ=6.\n\nThen at turn 28, choose U, at turn 29 y=2, τ=7.\n\nTurn 29 U, turn 30 y=3, τ=8\n\nTurn 30 U, turn 31 y=4, τ=9\n\nTurn 31 U, turn 32 y=5, τ=10\n\nTurn 32 U, turn 33 y=6, τ=11\n\nTurn 33 U, turn 34 y=7, τ=12\n\nTurn 34 U, turn 35 y=8, τ=13\n\nTurn 35 U, turn 36 y=9, τ=14\n\nNow, at turn 36, y=9, reached.\n\nNumber of actions: from turn 22 to turn 35, actions a22 to a35, that's 14 actions.\n\nH=14.\n\nThe sequence of actions: for turns 22 to 35, 14 actions.\n\nBut in the answer, it should be from turn t1=22.\n\nActions for turn 22 to turn 22+H-1, and after H actions, at turn 22+H, y=9.\n\nIn this case, actions from a22 to a35, turn 22+H =36, so H=14.\n\nActions: first 6 actions are S (from turn 22 to 27, but let's list the turns.\n\nTurn 22: choose S, so at turn 23, y=0\n\nTurn 23: choose S, at turn 24 y=0\n\n...\n\nUp to turn 26: choose S, at turn 27 y=0 (τ=5)\n\nThen turn 27: choose U, at turn 28 y=1\n\nTurn 28: U, turn 29 y=2\n\n...\nTurn 35: U, turn 36 y=9\n\nThe actions are for turns: a22=S, a23=S, a24=S, a25=S, a26=S, a27=U, a28=U, a29=U, a30=U, a31=U, a32=U, a33=U, a34=U, a35=U\n\nFrom a27 to a35 are U, that's 9 U, but a22 to a26 are S, 5 S.\n\nTotal actions 14.\n\nBut at turn 27, I choose U, position at turn 28 y=1.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nIs there a way to save one turn?\n\nFor example, if I can be on y=1 at τ=6 directly, but I have to go through.\n\nAt τ=5, if I am on y=5, but I can't.\n\nNotice that at τ=2, freeway 6 is safe, but I can't be there.\n\nSuppose at τ=0, I go U to y=1 at τ=1.\n\nAt τ=1, I go U to y=2 at τ=2.\n\nAt τ=2, I go D to y=1 at τ=3, but occupied, collision.\n\nNot possible.\n\nI think H=14 is minimal.\n\nBut let's see the car at freeway 6, always safe, so if I can reach y=6 early.\n\nFor example, at τ=3, if I am on y=6, safe.\n\nBut how? From start, in 3 steps, max y=3.\n\nNot possible.\n\nSimilarly, no.\n\nSo I think 14 is the answer.\n\nBut in the sequence, I stayed from turn 22 to 26, 5 S actions, then 9 U actions.\n\nTurn 22 to 26: 5 turns of S, keeping y=0.\n\nThen turn 27 to 35: 9 turns of U, to go from y=0 to y=9.\n\nBut from y=0 at turn 27 (τ=5), after first U at turn 27, at turn 28 y=1, which is τ=6, safe.\n\nThen to turn 36 y=9.\n\nYes.\n\nThe minimal H is 14.\n\nSo the sequence of actions.\n\nBut in the answer format, it should be for each turn.\n\nCurrent turn is t1=22.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 22: S\n\nTurn 23: S\n\nTurn 24: S\n\nTurn 25: S\n\nTurn 26: S\n\nTurn 27: U\n\nTurn 28: U\n\nTurn 29: U\n\nTurn 30: U\n\nTurn 31: U\n\nTurn 32: U\n\nTurn 33: U\n\nTurn 34: U\n\nTurn 35: U\n\nAnd after that, at turn 36, y=9.\n\nH=14 turns.\n\nBut let's confirm if at some point I can reduce.\n\nFor example, if at τ=5, I am at y=0, but I go U at τ=5 to y=1 at τ=6, but at τ=5, if I go U, position at τ=6 y=1, but at τ=5, I am at y=0, safe, no issue.\n\nBut I can't go to y=1 at τ=5 because occupied.\n\nIn the action at turn for τ=5, turn 27, if I choose U, then at turn 28 (τ=6) y=1, which is fine.\n\nBut if at turn 27 (τ=5), I choose U, then at turn 28 y=1, τ=6.\n\nBut at turn 27, position y=0, τ=5, I choose action.\n\nIf I choose U, then next position y=1 at turn 28, τ=6.\n\nI don't go to y=1 at τ=5.\n\nAt τ=5, I am at y=0, safe.\n\nThen action U takes me to y=1 at τ=6.\n\nNo problem.\n\nIn my sequence, it's correct.\n\nI think it's minimal.\n\nSo for the answer.\n</think>\nTo reach position (0, 9) from (0, 0) at turn \\(t_1 = 22\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 14. The sequence of actions must ensure that at each turn, if the player is on a freeway (y between 1 and 8), that freeway is not occupied by any car at position 0 at that turn.\n\nThe car states at turn 22 are:\n- Freeway 1: Occupied at turns relative to \\(t_1\\): \\(\\tau = 3, 4, 5, 12, 13, 14\\)\n- Freeway 2: Occupied at \\(\\tau = 3, 4, 5, 12, 13, 14\\)\n- Freeway 3: Occupied at \\(\\tau = 4, 5\\)\n- Freeway 4: Occupied at \\(\\tau = 4, 5\\)\n- Freeway 5: Occupied at \\(\\tau = 2\\)\n- Freeway 6: Never occupied\n- Freeway 7: Occupied at \\(\\tau = 2\\)\n- Freeway 8: Occupied at \\(\\tau = 2\\)\n\nwhere \\(\\tau = T - t_1 = T - 22\\) is the turn offset.\n\nThe dangerous periods are:\n- At \\(\\tau = 2\\): Avoid y = 5, 7, 8\n- At \\(\\tau = 3\\): Avoid y = 1, 2\n- At \\(\\tau = 4\\): Avoid y = 1, 2, 3, 4\n- At \\(\\tau = 5\\): Avoid y = 1, 2, 3, 4\n\nTo minimize \\(H\\), the player must stay at y = 0 (safe) during the dangerous turns \\(\\tau = 2\\) to \\(\\tau = 5\\) (turns 24 to 27) to avoid collisions. After \\(\\tau = 5\\), the player can move upward without obstruction until y = 9 is reached.\n\nThe sequence of actions is as follows:\n- Stay at y = 0 for turns 22 to 26 (5 turns) to cover \\(\\tau = 0\\) to \\(\\tau = 4\\) (y = 0 is safe).\n- At turn 27 (\\(\\tau = 5\\)), stay at y = 0 to avoid the dangerous y positions.\n- From turn 28 (\\(\\tau = 6\\)) to turn 35 (\\(\\tau = 13\\)), move upward each turn to reach y = 9 at turn 36 (\\(\\tau = 14\\)).\n\nThis results in \\(H = 14\\) turns, with the player reaching (0, 9) at turn 36.\n\n**Action Sequence**:\n- Turn 22: S (stay at y = 0 for turn 23)\n- Turn 23: S (stay at y = 0 for turn 24)\n- Turn 24: S (stay at y = 0 for turn 25)\n- Turn 25: S (stay at y = 0 for turn 26)\n- Turn 26: S (stay at y = 0 for turn 27)\n- Turn 27: S (stay at y = 0 for turn 28; \\(\\tau = 5\\) ends, danger period over)\n- Turn 28: U (move to y = 1 at turn 29)\n- Turn 29: U (move to y = 2 at turn 30)\n- Turn 30: U (move to y = 3 at turn 31)\n- Turn 31: U (move to y = 4 at turn 32)\n- Turn 32: U (move to y = 5 at turn 33)\n- Turn 33: U (move to y = 6 at turn 34)\n- Turn 34: U (move to y = 7 at turn 35)\n- Turn 35: U (move to y = 8 at turn 36)\n- At turn 36, y = 9 is reached.\n\nNo collisions occur:\n- Turns 23-27 (\\(\\tau = 1\\) to \\(\\tau = 5\\)): y = 0, no freeway, safe.\n- Turn 29 (\\(\\tau = 7\\)): y = 1, freeway 1 not occupied at \\(\\tau = 7\\) (occupied at \\(\\tau = 3,4,5,12,13,14\\)).\n- Turn 30 (\\(\\tau = 8\\)): y = 2, freeway 2 not occupied at \\(\\tau = 8\\).\n- Turn 31 (\\(\\tau = 9\\)): y = 3, freeway 3 not occupied at \\(\\tau = 9\\) (occupied only at \\(\\tau = 4,5\\)).\n- Turn 32 (\\(\\tau = 10\\)): y = 4, freeway 4 not occupied at \\(\\tau = 10\\).\n- Turn 33 (\\(\\tau = 11\\)): y = 5, freeway 5 not occupied at \\(\\tau = 11\\) (occupied only at \\(\\tau = 2\\)).\n- Turn 34 (\\(\\tau = 12\\)): y = 6, freeway 6 always safe.\n- Turn 35 (\\(\\tau = 13\\)): y = 7, freeway 7 not occupied at \\(\\tau = 13\\) (occupied only at \\(\\tau = 2\\)).\n- Turn 36 (\\(\\tau = 14\\)): y = 8, freeway 8 not occupied at \\(\\tau = 14\\) (occupied only at \\(\\tau = 2\\)).\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 22: \\text{ } S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 23: \\text{ } S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 24: \\text{ } S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 25: \\text{ } S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 26: \\text{ } S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 27: \\text{ } S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 28: \\text{ } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 29: \\text{ } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 30: \\text{ } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 31: \\text{ } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 32: \\text{ } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 33: \\text{ } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 34: \\text{ } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 35: \\text{ } U \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible without colliding with any cars. The cars are on freeways y=1 to y=8, and I start at y=0. I move up, down, or stay, changing my y-position each turn.\n\nFirst, I should understand where the cars are at each turn and how they move, so I can avoid being on the same freeway when a car is at position x=0, since that's where collisions happen.\n\nThe collision condition is that at turn T, if I'm on freeway y_T, and for any car on that freeway, 0 is in the span of the car at that turn. The span changes over time based on the car's speed and direction.\n\nAll cars are moving right, from the data. Let me list the cars for each freeway.\n\nFreeway 1: three cars: (-48,-59,right,4), (-12,-23,right,4), (24,13,right,4)\n\nSince they're moving right, the span is [tail, head] with head > tail? No, in the update, for right-moving, it says: Span(t1) = [τ, h] and at T, [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nIn the car state, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed). But for right-moving, head should be greater than tail? Let's see.\n\nFor the first car on freeway 1: head = -48, tail = -59. Since it's right-moving, and head = -48, tail = -59, so tail < head, which makes sense for right-moving. So span at t1 is [τ, h] = [-59, -48]? No.\n\nLook: \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nAnd for update: right-moving, Span(t1) = [τ, h] → at T, [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nIn this case, for first car, h = -48, τ = -59, so Span(t1) = [τ, h] = [-59, -48]\n\nSimilarly, second car: h = -12, τ = -23, span [-23, -12]? τ = -23, h = -12, so [τ, h] = [-23, -12]\n\nThird car: h=24, τ=13, [13,24]\n\nAll right-moving, speed 4.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nt1 is given as 25, current turn.\n\nSo at turn t=25, for freeway 1:\n\nCar1: span [-59, -48]\n\nCar2: span [-23, -12]\n\nCar3: span [13,24]\n\nNow, at turn T, the span is [τ + s(T-25), h + s(T-25)] for each, since all right-moving.\n\ns is speed.\n\nCollision at turn T if I'm on that freeway and 0 is in the span for any car on that freeway.\n\nThe freeway number is fixed; cars don't move vertically, only horizontally.\n\nI need to go from y=0 to y=9, so I have to pass through each y-level, but I can skip some by moving up or down, but since I start at 0 and need to reach 9, I should probably go up most of the time, but I have to avoid collisions.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars, I assume, since cars are only on y=1 to 8.\n\nThe problem says: avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1,…,8, and player starts at (0,0), which is y=0, and target is (0,9), y=9, so y=0 and y=9 have no cars, so no collision there.\n\nNow, the minimal H: since I need to go from y=0 to y=9, the minimum number of moves is 9, if I go up every turn, but I might have to wait or go down to avoid cars, which could take more turns.\n\nBut with cars, I might need more turns to avoid.\n\nFirst, I need to find for each freeway and each turn, whether there is a car at x=0.\n\nThat is, for each freeway k, and for each time t after t1, whether 0 is in some car's span on freeway k at time t.\n\nt1=25, so let's set τ = t - 25, the offset from current turn.\n\nSo for time t, τ = t - 25.\n\nThen for each car, at time t, span is [τ + s τ, h + s τ] for right-moving cars, since [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] with T-t1 = τ.\n\nLet τ = T - 25.\n\nThen for a car with tail τ_tail, head h, speed s, at time T, span [τ_tail + s τ, h + s τ]\n\nCollision if 0 is in [τ_tail + s τ, h + s τ] for some car on freeway k, and I am on y=k at time T.\n\nNow, the player position: I start at y=0 at t=25.\n\nAt each turn, I choose action U, D, S, which changes y by +1, -1, 0, and y is clamped to [0,9].\n\nSo y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with Δy_t based on action at t.\n\nThe action at time t affects y_{t+1}.\n\nLet's clarify the timing.\n\nAt turn t, I am at position (0, y_t).\n\nI choose action a_t, which determines Δy_t, and then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nThen, at time t+1, I am at (0, y_{t+1}).\n\nNow, collision occurs at turn T if, when I am at y_T, and for some car on freeway y_T, 0 is in the car's span at time T.\n\nThe note says: if I move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, I am not considered on y_{T+1} at turn T, so I don't collide with cars on y_{T+1} at time T.\n\nBut at time T, I am on y_T, so I only care about cars on y_T at time T.\n\nThe collision is checked at each turn based on my current y at that turn and the cars on that y at that turn.\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need to find when it is safe to be there, i.e., when no car has 0 in its span at that time.\n\nSince the cars move, the times when x=0 is not covered by any car.\n\nFor each freeway, find the set of times τ (from now) when it is unsafe.\n\nτ = t - 25, so at τ=0, t=25.\n\nLet me make a table for each freeway k, the times τ when there is a car with 0 in span.\n\nStart with freeway 1.\n\nFreeway 1: three cars, all speed 4, right-moving.\n\nCar1: at τ, span [ -59 + 4τ, -48 + 4τ ]\n\n0 in span if -59 + 4τ ≤ 0 ≤ -48 + 4τ\n\nSimilarly, car2: [ -23 + 4τ, -12 + 4τ ], 0 in if -23 +4τ ≤ 0 ≤ -12 +4τ\n\nCar3: [13 +4τ, 24 +4τ], 0 in if 13+4τ ≤ 0 ≤ 24+4τ, but since τ≥0, 13+4τ ≥13>0, so 0 ≤ 13+4τ is false, so never for car3.\n\n13+4τ ≥13>0, so 0 < lower bound, so 0 not in span for any τ≥0.\n\nSimilarly, car1: -59 +4τ ≤ 0 ≤ -48 +4τ\n\nFirst inequality: -59 +4τ ≤ 0 => 4τ ≤ 59 => τ ≤ 59/4 = 14.75\n\nSecond inequality: 0 ≤ -48 +4τ => 4τ ≥ 48 => τ ≥ 12\n\nSo for τ integer, τ from 12 to 14 inclusive?

Let's index properly.\n\nAt the start, τ=0, time t=25, position y_0 = 0.\n\nAfter first action a_0, at time t=26 (τ=1), position y_1.\n\nAfter second action a_1, at time t=27 (τ=2), position y_2.\n\n...\n\nAfter k actions, at time t=25+k, position y_k.\n\nI need to be at y=9 at some time T, which corresponds to τ = T - 25.\n\nSince I start at τ=0 with y=0, and I need to reach y=9 at some τ_final.\n\nThe number of turns H is the number of actions, so from τ=0 to τ=H, I have positions y_0 to y_H, with H actions in between.\n\nBut the sequence is for actions from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, so H actions.\n\nAfter H actions, I am at y_H, and I want y_H =9.\n\nThe time at which I reach y=9 is τ=H.\n\nBut collision is at each time step τ based on y_τ.\n\nFor minimal H, I want to reach as fast as possible.\n\nSince y changes slowly, I need to plan the path.\n\nThe unsafe times are sparse, so I might be able to go straight up with few delays.\n\nFirst, let's list for each τ, which freeways are unsafe.\n\nFor each τ from 0 up, say to 20, list which y are unsafe.\n\nτ=0: all freeways safe? y=1 to 8.\n\nFreeway 5,7,8 unsafe at τ=2, but τ=0: check each.\n\nFreeway 1: unsafe at 3,4,5,12,13,14 so τ=0 safe\n\nFreeway 2 same, safe\n\nFreeway 3: unsafe 4,5, so τ=0 safe\n\nFreeway 4 same, safe\n\nFreeway 5: unsafe τ=2 only, so τ=0 safe\n\nFreeway 6 always safe, so safe\n\nFreeway 7: unsafe τ=2, so τ=0 safe\n\nFreeway 8: unsafe τ=2, so τ=0 safe\n\nSo at τ=0, all freeways safe.\n\nτ=1: similarly, all unsafe times start from τ=2 or later, so τ=1 all safe.\n\nτ=2: freeway 5,7,8 unsafe. Freeway 5 at τ=2, freeway 7 at τ=2, freeway 8 at τ=2.\n\nFreeway 1,2,3,4,6 safe at τ=2.\n\nFreeway 1 unsafe only at 3,4,5,12,etc, not 2.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nSo at τ=2, unsafe: y=5,7,8\n\nSafe: y=1,2,3,4,6\n\nτ=3: freeway 1 and 2 unsafe (since τ=3 for them), freeway 3 unsafe at 4,5 not 3, freeway 4 same, freeway 5 unsafe only τ=2, so safe now, freeway 6 safe, freeway 7 unsafe only τ=2, safe, freeway 8 same.\n\nFreeway 1 unsafe at τ=3,4,5\n\nFreeway 2 same.\n\nFreeway 3 unsafe at τ=4,5, so τ=3 safe.\n\nFreeway 4 same.\n\nFreeway 5 unsafe τ=2 only, so safe.\n\nFreeway 6 safe.\n\nFreeway 7 unsafe τ=2 only, safe.\n\nFreeway 8 same.\n\nSo at τ=3, unsafe: y=1 and y=2\n\nSafe: y=3,4,5,6,7,8\n\ny=5,7,8 are safe at τ=3, since unsafe only at τ=2.\n\nτ=4: freeway 1 unsafe (τ=4), freeway 2 unsafe, freeway 3 unsafe (τ=4,5), freeway 4 unsafe (same), freeway 5 safe, freeway 6 safe, freeway 7 safe, freeway 8 safe.\n\nSo unsafe: y=1,2,3,4\n\nSafe: y=5,6,7,8\n\nτ=5: similar, freeway 1,2,3,4 unsafe.\n\nSafe: y=5,6,7,8\n\nτ=6: freeway 1 unsafe? τ=3,4,5, so τ=6 safe for y=1,2.\n\nFreeway 1 unsafe τ=3,4,5,12,13,14 so τ=6 safe.\n\nSimilarly freeway 2 safe.\n\nFreeway 3 unsafe τ=4,5, so τ=6 safe.\n\nFreeway 4 safe.\n\nFreeway 5 safe.\n\nFreeway 6 safe.\n\nFreeway 7 safe.\n\nFreeway 8 safe.\n\nSo all safe at τ=6.\n\nτ=7 to τ=11: similarly, no unsafe until τ=12.\n\nFreeway 1 unsafe at τ=12,13,14, etc.\n\nBut τ=7 to 11 all should be safe for all y.\n\nCheck:\n\nFreeway 1: unsafe only τ=3,4,5,12,13,14 so τ=7,8,9,10,11 safe\n\nFreeway 2 same\n\nFreeway 3 unsafe τ=4,5 only, so safe after\n\nFreeway 4 same\n\nFreeway 5 unsafe only τ=2, safe\n\nFreeway 6 safe\n\nFreeway 7 unsafe only τ=2, safe\n\nFreeway 8 same\n\nSo for τ=6 to 11, all freeways safe.\n\nτ=12: freeway 1 and 2 unsafe (τ=12,13,14)\n\nOthers safe.\n\nFreeway 3 unsafe only τ=4,5, so safe\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo unsafe: y=1,2\n\nSafe: y=3,4,5,6,7,8\n\nτ=13: same, y=1,2 unsafe\n\nτ=14: y=1,2 unsafe\n\nτ=15: all safe again, since freeway 1 unsafe only up to 14, etc.\n\nNow, I start at y=0 at τ=0.\n\nI need to reach y=9 at some τ=H.\n\nMinimal H: if no cars, I could go up each turn, so from y=0 to y=9, I need 9 moves up, so at τ=9, y=9.\n\nBut with cars, I might need to avoid some positions at certain times.\n\nNow, at τ=0, I am at y=0.\n\nI choose action: U, D, or S.\n\nIf I go up, to y=1 at τ=1.\n\nIf stay, y=0 at τ=1, etc.\n\nNow, let's see the critical points.\n\nFirst, at τ=2, y=5,7,8 are unsafe, so I should not be on y=5,7, or 8 at τ=2.\n\nSimilarly, at τ=3, y=1 and 2 unsafe.\n\nAt τ=4 and 5, y=1,2,3,4 unsafe.\n\nThen τ=12,13,14 y=1,2 unsafe.\n\nSince I start from y=0, and need to go up, I should avoid being on unsafe positions at those times.\n\nMinimal path might be to go up as much as possible, but delay when necessary.\n\nSince the only constraints are at specific τ, and freeways are safe most of the time.\n\nFor example, to go from y=0 to y=9, I need to be on each y from 1 to 8 at some point, but I can stay or move, so I can skip some if I move fast, but since I move only ±1 or 0, I have to visit each integer y between min and max, so I must pass through all from 0 to 9, but I can stay multiple times or go down, but to minimize time, I should not go down unnecessarily.\n\nThe shortest path in terms of moves is 9 up moves, taking 9 turns.\n\nBut I might need to wait at some safe position to avoid being on unsafe position at wrong time.\n\nI start at τ=0, y=0.\n\nI need to be at y=9 at τ=H.\n\nThe position y_τ must be safe for each τ.\n\nNow, let's list for each τ, the forbidden y.\n\nτ=0: all y safe, but y=0 is safe, I am there.\n\nτ=1: all y safe.\n\nτ=2: y=5,7,8 unsafe.\n\nτ=3: y=1,2 unsafe.\n\nτ=4: y=1,2,3,4 unsafe.\n\nτ=5: y=1,2,3,4 unsafe.\n\nτ=6: all safe.\n\nτ=7: all safe.\n\n...\n\nτ=11: all safe.\n\nτ=12: y=1,2 unsafe.\n\nτ=13: y=1,2 unsafe.\n\nτ=14: y=1,2 unsafe.\n\nτ=15: all safe.\n\nI need to go from y=0 to y=9.\n\nSince τ=4 and τ=5, y=1,2,3,4 are all unsafe, so I cannot be on y=1 to 4 at τ=4 or τ=5.\n\nSimilarly, at τ=3, y=1 and 2 unsafe, so I cannot be on y=1 or 2 at τ=3.\n\nAt τ=2, y=5,7,8 unsafe, so cannot be on those.\n\nNow, at τ=0, I am at y=0.\n\nPossible actions: I can go up to y=1 at τ=1, or stay at y=0.\n\nIf I go up to y=1 at τ=1 (so at time τ=1, y=1).\n\nAt τ=1, all y safe, so y=1 is safe.\n\nThen at τ=1, I am at y=1.\n\nNow, from here, I need to choose next action.\n\nBut at τ=2, y=5,7,8 unsafe, but y=1 is safe at τ=2? Earlier at τ=2, unsafe y=5,7,8, so y=1,2,3,4,6 safe.\n\nSo if I am at y=1 at τ=1, I can stay, go up, or down.\n\nIf I stay, at τ=2, I am at y=1, which is safe at τ=2.\n\nBut at τ=3, y=1 is unsafe, so I cannot be at y=1 at τ=3.\n\nSimilarly, if I go up to y=2 at τ=2, then at τ=2, y=2 is safe, but at τ=3, y=2 is unsafe.\n\nProblem at τ=3.\n\nLet's plan step by step.\n\nI need to avoid being on low y at τ=3,4,5.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- At τ=3, cannot be on y=1 or 2\n\n- At τ=4, cannot be on y=1,2,3,4\n\n- At τ=5, cannot be on y=1,2,3,4\n\nAlso, at τ=2, cannot be on y=5,7,8\n\nNow, since I start from low, and need to go high, I should move up quickly before τ=3 or after τ=5.\n\nBut τ=4 and 5 are problematic for low y.\n\nOptions:\n\n1. Reach y=5 or above by τ=3, so that at τ=3,4,5 I am on high y which are safe.\n\nAt τ=3, safe y are 3,4,5,6,7,8\n\nBut y=3 and 4 are unsafe at τ=4 and 5.\n\nAt τ=3, y=3 and 4 are safe, but at τ=4, y=3 and 4 unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, at τ=5, y=3,4 unsafe.\n\nSo if I am on y=3 or 4 at τ=3, it is safe at τ=3, but then at τ=4, if I am still on y=3 or 4, unsafe.\n\nI need to be at y>=5 by τ=4.\n\nSimilarly, at τ=5, y>=5.\n\nNow, at τ=2, y=5,7,8 are unsafe, but y=6 is safe, since freeway 6 always safe.\n\ny=5 unsafe at τ=2, y=7,8 unsafe at τ=2.\n\ny=6 safe.\n\nNow, back to planning.\n\nStart at τ=0, y=0.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nMinimal time: if I go up every turn, I would be at y=1 at τ=1, y=2 at τ=2, y=3 at τ=3, y=4 at τ=4, y=5 at τ=5, etc.\n\nBut at τ=3, y=3: is it safe? At τ=3, y=3 is safe, as per earlier.\n\nAt τ=3, unsafe y=1,2; safe y=3,4,5,6,7,8.\n\nSo at τ=3, y=3 is ok.\n\nBut at τ=4, y=3 is unsafe (since y=1,2,3,4 unsafe at τ=4)\n\nSimilarly, at τ=5, y=4 would be unsafe if I were there.\n\nIn the direct path: at τ=1, y=1\n\nτ=2, y=2\n\nτ=3, y=3 — safe since τ=3 y=3 safe\n\nThen at τ=3, I choose action to go to y=4 at τ=4? But at τ=4, y=4 is unsafe.\n\nProblem.\n\nIf at τ=3, I stay at y=3, then at τ=4, y=3 unsafe.\n\nIf I go up to y=4, at τ=4, y=4 unsafe.\n\nIf I go down to y=2, but at τ=4, y=2 also unsafe, and at τ=3, y=2 is unsafe anyway.\n\nAt τ=3, I cannot go to y=2 because y=2 unsafe at τ=3.\n\nAt τ=3, y must not be 1 or 2.\n\nSo if I am at y=3 at τ=3, I can only go up or stay or down, but down to y=2 not allowed at τ=3.\n\nOptions at τ=3: from y=3, I can:\n\n- Go up to y=4 at τ=4, but y=4 unsafe at τ=4\n\n- Stay at y=3 at τ=4, unsafe\n\n- Go down to y=2 at τ=4, but y=2 unsafe at τ=4 and also at τ=3 y=2 unsafe, but I am moving to y=2 at τ=4.\n\nAt time τ=3, I am at y=3, safe.\n\nI choose action, which determines y_4.\n\nAt τ=4, I will be at y_4, which must be safe, so y_4 cannot be 1,2,3,4.\n\nSo y_4 must be 5,6,7,8.\n\nSimilarly, from y=3, to go to y>=5, I need to go up twice, but I can only change by 1 per turn.\n\nFrom y=3 at τ=3, I can go up to y=4 at τ=4, but y=4 is unsafe at τ=4, collision.\n\nIf I go down, to y=2 at τ=4, but y=2 unsafe at τ=4.\n\nOr stay, y=3 unsafe.\n\nSo all choices lead to collision at τ=4 if I am at y=3 at τ=3.\n\nTherefore, I cannot be at y=3 at τ=3 in the first place.\n\nSimilarly, if I am at y=4 at τ=3, same issue.\n\nAt τ=3, if I am at y=4, safe at τ=3.\n\nThen at τ=4, y must be 5,6,7,8.\n\nBut from y=4, I can go up to y=5 at τ=4.\n\nBut at τ=4, y=5: is it safe? At τ=4, unsafe y=1,2,3,4; safe y=5,6,7,8.\n\ny=5 is safe at τ=4.\n\nSimilarly, y=6,7,8 safe.\n\nSo if at τ=3 I am at y=4, I can go up to y=5 at τ=4, safe.\n\nBut at τ=3, how did I get to y=4?\n\nBack to start.\n\nAt τ=0, y=0.\n\nIf I go up to y=1 at τ=1.\n\nAt τ=1, y=1, safe.\n\nNow at τ=1, I choose action.\n\nI need to be at y>=4 by τ=3? Let's see.\n\nAt τ=3, I must not be on y=1 or 2, so must be y>=3.\n\nBut if y=3 or 4 at τ=3, it might be possible only if I can jump to higher at τ=4.\n\nBut for y=3 at τ=3, I cannot reach y>=5 at τ=4, since I can only change by 1.\n\nFrom y=3, at next step y=2,3, or 4, all <=4, but at τ=4, y<=4 are unsafe except if y=5,6,7,8.\n\nBut from y=3, I can only get to y=2,3,4 at τ=4, all unsafe.\n\nTherefore, if I am at y=3 at τ=3, I must go to y=2,3, or 4 at τ=4, all unsafe, so collision inevitable.\n\nSimilarly, if at y=4 at τ=3, I can go to y=3,4,5 at τ=4.\n\ny=3 and 4 unsafe at τ=4, y=5 safe.\n\nSo I can go to y=5 at τ=4, safe.\n\nBut I need to be at y=4 at τ=3.\n\nSimilarly, if at y=5 at τ=3, I can go to y=4,5,6 at τ=4.\n\ny=4 unsafe at τ=4, but y=5 and 6 safe, so I can stay or go up to y=6.\n\nBut let's not get ahead.\n\nFirst, to avoid being on low y at critical times.\n\nSpecifically, I must not be on y=1 or 2 at τ=3.\n\nAnd I must not be on y=1,2,3,4 at τ=4 and τ=5.\n\nAlso, at τ=2, I must not be on y=5,7,8.\n\nNow, since I start from y=0, I need to move up.\n\nAt τ=0, y=0.\n\nI can:\n\n- Go up to y=1 at τ=1\n\n- Stay at y=0 at τ=1\n\n- Or go down, but going down to y=-1 not possible, y min 0, so only U or S.\n\nS: stay at y=0.\n\nBut staying at y=0 is safe, but I need to move up eventually.\n\nIf I stay at y=0 at τ=1, then I am still at start, wasting time.\n\nProbably not minimal.\n\nSimilarly, go up.\n\nAssume I go up at τ=0 to y=1 at τ=1.\n\nNow at τ=1, y=1, safe.\n\nI need to choose action for τ=1.\n\nIf I go up to y=2 at τ=2.\n\nAt τ=2, y=2 is safe, as per earlier, since only y=5,7,8 unsafe, y=2 safe.\n\nBut at τ=3, y=2 is unsafe, so I cannot be at y=2 at τ=3.\n\nTherefore, at τ=2, I must not stay at y=2 or go down; I must go up to y=3 at τ=3 or something.\n\nAt τ=2, I am at y=2.\n\nThen I choose action: if I go up to y=3 at τ=3, but at τ=3, y=3 is safe, as we said.\n\nBut then at τ=3, y=3, I have the problem as before: at τ=4, I cannot be at y=3 or less, but from y=3, I can only go to y=2,3,4 at τ=4, all unsafe.\n\nUnless I can be at higher y at τ=3.\n\nSo at τ=2, instead of going to y=3, I could go to other y.\n\nAt τ=2, from y=2, I can go up to y=3, down to y=1, or stay at y=2.\n\nBut down to y=1 at τ=3: at τ=3, y=1 unsafe.\n\nStay at y=2 at τ=3, unsafe.\n\nGo up to y=3 at τ=3, which is safe at τ=3, but leads to problem at τ=4.\n\nAll bad? But y=1 at τ=3 unsafe, so I cannot go down or stay.\n\nOnly option is go up to y=3 at τ=3, but then stuck.\n\nPerhaps I should not be at y=2 at τ=2.\n\nMaybe at τ=1, I should not go to y=2.\n\nBack to τ=1, y=1.\n\nAt τ=1, I am at y=1.\n\nInstead of going up, I could stay or go down.\n\nGo down to y=0 at τ=2.\n\nBut y=0 is safe, no cars.\n\nThen at τ=2, y=0.\n\nThen at τ=2, I can go up to y=1 at τ=3.\n\nBut at τ=3, y=1 unsafe, collision.\n\nStay at y=0 at τ=3, safe, but not progressing.\n\nOr go up to y=1 at τ=3, unsafe.\n\nSo not good.\n\nStay at τ=1: at τ=1, from y=1, stay, so at τ=2, y=1.\n\nAt τ=2, y=1 is safe (since unsafe only y=5,7,8 at τ=2).\n\nThen at τ=2, y=1, I can go up to y=2 at τ=3, but at τ=3, y=2 unsafe.\n\nGo down to y=0 at τ=3, safe.\n\nOr stay at y=1 at τ=3, unsafe.\n\nSo only down to y=0 at τ=3 is safe, but then I am back to y=0, wasted time.\n\nNot efficient.\n\nSo from y=1 at τ=1, going to y=2 at τ=2 is problematic because then at τ=3 I have to move from y=2 which is bad.\n\nUnless I can be at higher y earlier.\n\nAt τ=0, instead of going up, I stay at y=0.\n\nThen at τ=1, y=0.\n\nThen I can go up to y=1 at τ=2.\n\nAt τ=2, y=1 is safe.\n\nThen at τ=2, from y=1, I need to choose action for τ=3.\n\nAt τ=3, I cannot be on y=1 or 2.\n\nSo from y=1 at τ=2, I must go up to y=2 at τ=3? But y=2 unsafe at τ=3.\n\nGo down to y=0 at τ=3, safe.\n\nOr stay at y=1 at τ=3, unsafe.\n\nSo only down to y=0 at τ=3 or up to y=2 unsafe.\n\nSo only down to y=0.\n\nAgain, back to start.\n\nSo to avoid being on low y at τ=3, I need to be at y>=3 at τ=3.\n\nSimilarly, for τ=4 and 5, y>=5.\n\nBut to be at y>=3 at τ=3, from y=0 at τ=0, I need to move up quickly.\n\nAt τ=0, go up to y=1 at τ=1.\n\nAt τ=1, go up to y=2 at τ=2.\n\nThen at τ=2, from y=2, I need to go up to y=3 at τ=3, but as before, then I am at y=3 at τ=3, which is safe, but at τ=4, I cannot be on y=3.\n\nBut at τ=3, from y=3, if I could go up twice, but I can't, only one step.\n\nUnless at τ=2, I am at a higher y.\n\nBut at τ=2, I am at y=2, which is not high.\n\nHow to be higher at τ=2.\n\nFrom start, at τ=0, y=0, I can only reach y=1 at τ=1, then y=2 at τ=2, maximum.\n\nUnless I start earlier, but τ=0 is fixed.\n\nPerhaps I can stay at y=0 for some turns, but that delays.\n\nAnother idea: go up to y=1 at τ=1, then at τ=1, instead of going to y=2, I go down or stay, but that doesn't help.\n\nPerhaps I can reach y=6 or something which is always safe.\n\nFreeway 6 is always safe, y=6.\n\nBut I need to get there.\n\nLet's list the safe positions over time.\n\nI need to have a path where at each τ, y_τ is safe.\n\nFor example:\n\nAt τ=0, y=0 safe.\n\nI must choose y for τ=1.\n\nAt τ=1, all y safe, so I can be at y=0 or y=1 or other, but from y=0, I can be at y=0 or y=1 at τ=1.\n\nIf I go to y=1 at τ=1.\n\nThen at τ=1, y=1 safe.\n\nNow for τ=2, I need y_2 safe, so not y=5,7,8.\n\nFrom y=1, I can go to y=0,1,2 at τ=2.\n\ny=0 safe, y=1 safe, y=2 safe at τ=2.\n\nAll options are safe at τ=2.\n\nBut then at τ=2, I am at some y, say I go to y=2 at τ=2.\n\nThen for τ=3, y must not be 1 or 2.\n\nSo from y=2 at τ=2, I can go to y=1,2,3 at τ=3.\n\ny=1 and 2 unsafe at τ=3, so I must go to y=3 at τ=3.\n\nSo at τ=3, y=3, safe at τ=3.\n\nThen at τ=3, y=3, for τ=4, y must not be 1,2,3,4, so must be y>=5.\n\nFrom y=3, I can go to y=2,3,4 at τ=4, all of which are <=4, so all unsafe at τ=4.\n\nImpossible to go to y>=5 from y=3 in one step.\n\nTherefore, collision at τ=4 if I am at y=3 at τ=3.\n\nIf at τ=2 I am at y=1 instead.\n\nAt τ=2, y=1, safe.\n\nThen for τ=3, must not be y=1 or 2, so from y=1, I can go to y=0,1,2 at τ=3.\n\ny=1 and 2 unsafe, so must go to y=0 at τ=3.\n\nThen at τ=3, y=0, safe.\n\nThen at τ=3, y=0, for τ=4, I can go to y=0 or y=1 at τ=4.\n\nBut at τ=4, y=1 unsafe, so I can only go to y=0 at τ=4 or stay, but y=0 safe.\n\nBut then I am stuck at y=0, not moving up.\n\nWasted turns.\n\nIf at τ=2 I am at y=0.\n\nFrom τ=1, y=1, I can go down to y=0 at τ=2.\n\nAt τ=2, y=0 safe.\n\nThen at τ=2, for τ=3, I can go to y=0 or y=1 at τ=3.\n\nAt τ=3, y=1 unsafe, so must go to y=0 at τ=3.\n\nThen same as above.\n\nSo all paths where I am at y<=2 at τ=2 lead to problem at τ=3 or later.\n\nTo avoid this, I need to be at y>=3 at τ=2, but from start, at τ=0 y=0, at τ=1 y=1, at τ=2 y=2, so y=2 at τ=2 is the maximum I can be.\n\nI cannot be higher than y=2 at τ=2.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to be at y>=3 at τ=2.\n\nSo I must be at y=2 at τ=2 if I move up, or lower if I stay.\n\nBut at y=2 at τ=2, then I go to y=3 at τ=3, and then at τ=4, I cannot avoid collision because I can't jump to y=5.\n\nUnless I can be on a safe position at τ=4.\n\nBut from y=3, I can only be at y=2,3,4 at τ=4, all unsafe.\n\nSo the only way is to not be on y=3 at τ=3, or to be on a safe y at τ=4.\n\nBut if I am at y=3 at τ=3, I can't be safe at τ=4.\n\nSo I must not be at y=3 at τ=3.\n\nSimilarly for y=4 at τ=3.\n\nBut at τ=3, I can be at y=5 or higher.\n\nBut how to be at y=5 at τ=3 from start?\n\nAt τ=0 y=0, τ=1 y=1, τ=2 y=2, τ=3 y=3, can't be y=5.\n\nSo impossible to be at y=5 at τ=3.\n\nTherefore, the only possibility is to be at y=0 or 1 at τ=3, but at τ=3, y=1 and 2 are unsafe, so I must be at y=0 at τ=3 or y>=3.\n\nBut y>=3 at τ=3 is possible, y=3, but then problem at τ=4.\n\nOr y=0 at τ=3.\n\nIf I am at y=0 at τ=3, safe.\n\nThen at τ=3, I can start moving up.\n\nBut at τ=4 and τ=5, y=1,2,3,4 are unsafe, so I cannot be on those at τ=4 and 5.\n\nSo at τ=3, y=0, I can go to y=1 at τ=4, but y=1 unsafe at τ=4.\n\nGo to y=0 at τ=4, stay.\n\nThen at τ=4, y=0, safe.\n\nThen at τ=4, I can go to y=1 at τ=5, but at τ=5, y=1 unsafe.\n\nOr stay at y=0.\n\nSo I have to stay at y=0 until τ=6.\n\nAt τ=6, all safe, I can start moving up.\n\nThen from τ=6, y=0, I can go up each turn to y=9 at τ=15.\n\nBut that takes many turns.\n\nH=15 actions, from τ=0 to τ=15, y_15=9.\n\nBut perhaps I can move earlier.\n\nAt τ=5, all safe for high y, but low y unsafe.\n\nAt τ=5, unsafe y=1,2,3,4; safe y=5,6,7,8.\n\nIf I can be at y=5 at τ=5, safe.\n\nBut to be at y=5 at τ=5, from where?\n\nFor example, at τ=3, I am at y=0.\n\nAt τ=3, y=0, I can stay or go up, but at τ=4, if I go up to y=1, unsafe, so I must stay at y=0 at τ=4.\n\nSimilarly, at τ=4, y=0, I can go to y=1 at τ=5, unsafe, or stay at y=0 at τ=5.\n\nAt τ=5, y=0 safe.\n\nThen at τ=5, I can go up to y=1 at τ=6.\n\nAt τ=6, all safe, so y=1 safe.\n\nThen I can go up each turn to y=9 at τ=15.\n\nBut from τ=5 to τ=6, y=1 at τ=6.\n\nThen to go to y=9, from y=1 at τ=6 to y=9 at τ=15, 9 moves, τ=6 to τ=15, that's 9 steps, from y=1 to y=9, 8 moves? Let's calculate.\n\nAt τ=5, y=0.\n\nAction at τ=5: go up, so at τ=6, y=1.\n\nThen action at τ=6: go up, at τ=7, y=2.\n\n...\nup to action at τ=13: go up, at τ=14, y=8.\n\nAction at τ=14: go up, at τ=15, y=9.\n\nSo at τ=15, y=9.\n\nNumber of actions: from τ=0 to τ=14, actions a0 to a14, H=15 actions.\n\nτ from 0 to 14, 15 actions, y from y0 to y15.\n\ny0 at τ=0, y15 at τ=15.\n\nH=15.\n\nBut I started at τ=0, and reached at τ=15.\n\nBut I wasted time from τ=0 to τ=5 at y=0.\n\nAt τ=0 to τ=5, I was at y=0.\n\nBut at τ=0,1,2,3,4,5 I was at y=0 except at τ=1 and 2 I could have been elsewhere, but in this path, I stayed.\n\nPerhaps I can be at higher y earlier.\n\nAnother idea: since at τ=2, y=6 is safe, and freeway 6 always safe, if I can be at y=6 at τ=2.\n\nBut from start, at τ=0 y=0, τ=1 y=1, τ=2 y=2, can't be y=6.\n\nImpossible.\n\nAt τ=1, I am at y=1, I can only be at y=0,1,2 at τ=2.\n\nNo higher.\n\nSo the only way is to stay at low y until after τ=5, then move up.\n\nBut at τ=3,4,5, low y are unsafe, so I have to be at y=0 or y>=5, but y>=5 at τ=3 is impossible, so only y=0.\n\nSo I must be at y=0 from τ=3 to τ=5 or something.\n\nLet's define the path.\n\nStart at τ=0, y=0.\n\nTo avoid problems, I stay at y=0 for the first few turns.\n\nAt τ=0, I choose S (stay), so at τ=1, y=0.\n\nSimilarly, at τ=1, choose S, at τ=2, y=0.\n\nAt τ=2, y=0 safe.\n\nNow at τ=2, I need to choose action for τ=3.\n\nAt τ=3, I must not be on y=1 or 2, so from y=0, I can go to y=0 or y=1 at τ=3.\n\ny=1 unsafe at τ=3, so I must go to y=0 at τ=3. Choose S.\n\nAt τ=3, y=0 safe.\n\nNow at τ=3, for τ=4, I can go to y=0 or y=1.\n\nAt τ=4, y=1 unsafe, so go to y=0, S.\n\nAt τ=4, y=0 safe.\n\nAt τ=4, for τ=5, go to y=0 or y=1.\n\nAt τ=5, y=1 unsafe, so go to y=0, S.\n\nAt τ=5, y=0 safe.\n\nNow at τ=5, for τ=6, I can go to y=1 at τ=6.\n\nAt τ=6, all safe, so y=1 safe.\n\nThen from here, I can go up each turn.\n\nAt τ=6, y=1.\n\nAction U, to y=2 at τ=7.\n\nτ=7 all safe.\n\nU to y=3 at τ=8.\n\nU to y=4 at τ=9.\n\nU to y=5 at τ=10.\n\nU to y=6 at τ=11.\n\nU to y=7 at τ=12.\n\nAt τ=12, y=7: is it safe? At τ=12, unsafe y=1,2; safe y=3,4,5,6,7,8, so y=7 safe.\n\nU to y=8 at τ=13.\n\nτ=13, unsafe y=1,2, so y=8 safe.\n\nU to y=9 at τ=14.\n\nAt τ=14, y=9, which is safe.\n\nNow, I reached at τ=14.\n\ny at τ=14 is 9.\n\nNow, number of actions: from τ=0 to τ=13, actions a0 to a13, H=14 actions.\n\ny0 to y14.\n\nAt τ=0, y0=0.\n\nAction a0=S, y1=0 at τ=1\n\na1=S, y2=0 at τ=2\n\na2=S, y3=0 at τ=3\n\na3=S, y4=0 at τ=4\n\na4=S, y5=0 at τ=5\n\na5=U, y6=1 at τ=6\n\na6=U, y7=2 at τ=7\n\na7=U, y8=3 at τ=8\n\na8=U, y9=4 at τ=9\n\na9=U, y10=5 at τ=10\n\na10=U, y11=6 at τ=11\n\na11=U, y12=7 at τ=12\n\na12=U, y13=8 at τ=13\n\na13=U, y14=9 at τ=14\n\nNow, is there any collision? We need to check at each τ, y_τ and if on freeway, not collided.\n\nAt τ=0, y=0, not on freeway, safe.\n\nτ=1, y=0, safe\n\nτ=2, y=0, safe\n\nτ=3, y=0, safe\n\nτ=4, y=0, safe\n\nτ=5, y=0, safe\n\nτ=6, y=1, freeway 1, at τ=6, is it safe? Earlier, freeway 1 unsafe at τ=3,4,5,12,13,14? τ=6 is not in unsafe, and since τ=6 all safe, yes.\n\nτ=6: freeway 1 unsafe only at τ=3,4,5,12,13,14, so τ=6 safe.\n\nSimilarly, τ=7, y=2, freeway 2, unsafe at same times, τ=7 not unsafe, safe.\n\nτ=8, y=3, freeway 3, unsafe at τ=4,5, τ=8 safe.\n\nτ=9, y=4, freeway 4, unsafe τ=4,5, τ=9 safe.\n\nτ=10, y=5, freeway 5, unsafe only τ=2, τ=10 safe.\n\nτ=11, y=6, freeway 6, always safe.\n\nτ=12, y=7, freeway 7, unsafe only τ=2, τ=12 safe.\n\nτ=13, y=8, freeway 8, unsafe only τ=2, τ=13 safe.\n\nτ=14, y=9, not freeway, safe.\n\nAll safe.\n\nH=14 actions.\n\nBut earlier I thought min is 9, but with constraints, it took 14.\n\nCan I do better?\n\nFor example, at τ=5, I am at y=0, but instead of waiting, can I be at higher y earlier?\n\nAt τ=2, I am at y=0, which is safe, but I could have moved to y=1 or something, but at τ=3,4,5 I have to be at y=0 to avoid collision.\n\nSuppose at τ=0, I go up to y=1 at τ=1.\n\nThen at τ=1, y=1, I must go down or stay to avoid being at y=1 or 2 at τ=3, but at τ=1, I need to set for τ=2.\n\nAt τ=1, y=1, I can go down to y=0 at τ=2.\n\nThen at τ=2, y=0, then as before, I have to stay until τ=6.\n\nSame as before.\n\nAt τ=1, y=1, I go up to y=2 at τ=2.\n\nThen at τ=2, y=2, I must go up to y=3 at τ=3, but then at τ=4, collision.\n\nNo way.\n\nSo the above path seems necessary, with 5 waits at start.\n\nBut τ from 0 to 5, I stayed at y=0 for 6 turns? From τ=0 to τ=5, I am at y=0, that's positions at τ=0,1,2,3,4,5 all y=0, so 6 turns at start.\n\nThen from τ=6 to τ=14, 9 turns to go up.\n\nτ=6 y=1 to τ=14 y=9, 8 moves? y from 1 to 9, 8 steps, but from τ=6 to τ=14, that's 8 intervals, 9 positions?

No.\n\nt: at time t, position.\n\nAt t=25, position y=0.\n\nAfter action a_t, position at t+1.\n\nIn the output, it says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\"\n\nt_1 + t for t from 0 to H-1.\n\nt_1=25, t from 0 to H-1, so actions at time: 25 + 0, 25+1, ..., 25 + (H-1)\n\nAfter H actions, at time 25 + H, position y_{25+H} =9.\n\nIn this case, H=14, so actions at t=25 to 25+13=38.\n\nAt time t=38, I perform action, and at t=39, position y=9.\n\nBut the sequence is actions from t=25 to t=38.\n\nIn the output, it should list actions for each turn.\n\nNow, but in the answer format, it should be minimal H.\n\nBut is there a shorter path?\n\nSuppose I go up at the beginning to y=1 at τ=1.\n\nThen at τ=1, I stay or down, but to avoid τ=3.\n\nBut at τ=2, if I am at y=1, I can go to y=0 at τ=3, but then I have to stay.\n\nSame as before.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=6 directly, but impossible.\n\nAnother idea: at τ=2, I am at y=0, but if I could be at y=3 or something, no.\n\nPerhaps I can move up during safe times.\n\nFor example, at τ=0, go to y=1.\n\nτ=1, go to y=2.\n\nThen at τ=2, from y=2, instead of going up, I go down to y=1 at τ=3? But τ=3 y=1 unsafe.\n\nNot possible.\n\nSo I think H=14 is minimal.\n\nBut let's see if I can start moving at τ=4 or something.\n\nAt τ=4, if I am at y=0, I can go to y=1? But at τ=5, y=1 unsafe if I go to y=1 at τ=5, but at τ=4, if I go up, to y=1 at τ=5, but τ=5 y=1 unsafe.\n\nSo I cannot go up at τ=4.\n\nMust stay.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo no.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is as above.\n\nNow, in the output, I need to write it.\n\nBut in the car state, freeway 6 has only one car, but we didn't use it.\n\nAlso, for τ=12,13,14, y=1,2 unsafe, but I avoided by being high.\n\nIn my path, at τ=12, I am at y=7, fine.\n\nNow, the answer should be in the box.\n\nBut let's write the actions clearly.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 25\\) is 14, with the sequence of actions starting from turn 25 to turn 38.\n\nThe sequence avoids collisions by staying at \\(y = 0\\) (safe, no cars) during turns 25 to 29 (offset \\(\\tau = 0\\) to \\(\\tau = 4\\)), as freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) have unsafe periods at \\(\\tau = 2, 3, 4, 5\\) for various freeways.

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 28. The player starts at (0,0) and wants to reach (0,9) in minimal turns H, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways 1 to 8 (y=1 to y=8) at the moment when the player is on that freeway.\n\nImportant note: Collision occurs at turn T only if at that turn the player is on a freeway y (which is from 1 to 8) and the car on that freeway has its span covering 0 at turn T.\n\nAlso note: The player's position at turn T is (0, y_T). When the player takes an action at turn T, the next position is computed for turn T+1. And importantly, when moving (say from y to y+1 at turn T), at turn T the player is still on the old row (y) and at turn T+1 on the new row (y+1). Therefore, the collision check for a freeway happens only when the player is on that freeway at a particular turn.\n\nWe must avoid:\n- At any turn T (from t1 to t1+H-1), if the player is on freeway k (so y_T = k, which is between 1 and 8) and for the car(s) on that freeway, the span at turn T must not contain 0.\n\nWe are given the car states at turn t1=28. For each car, we know its head, tail, direction, and speed. We note that:\n- For right-moving cars: the span at time t is [tau + s*(t - t1), h + s*(t - t1)]? Actually, the update rule is:\n  Right-moving: initial span at t1 is [tau, h] (so tail is at the left, head at the right) and at time T: [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n- Left-moving: initial span at t1 is [h, tau] (head at left, tail at right) and at T: [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut note: in the given state, all cars are right-moving? Looking at the data:\nAll cars have direction \"right\". So we only need the right-moving formula.\n\nLet me rewrite the car update for right-moving:\nAt time T (>= t1), the car's span is:\n  [tail_initial + s*(T - t1), head_initial + s*(T - t1)]\n\nBut note: the given data for each car at t1 is (head, tail, direction, speed). However, for right-moving, the head is the rightmost and tail the leftmost? But in the example, we have for freeway 1: (-48,-59,right,4). This seems backwards because -48 > -59. So actually, the head is the larger number? Because the car is moving right, so the head (front) should be to the right of the tail (back). But here, -48 is greater than -59, so that makes sense: the car spans from -59 (tail) to -48 (head). Similarly, the next car: (-12,-23,right,4): from -23 to -12? Actually, no: the given is (head, tail) so head=-12, tail=-23? Then the span is from tail to head: [-23, -12]. But the update rule for right-moving says: initial span at t1 is [tau, h]? That would be [tail, head]? So for the first car: tail=-59, head=-48 -> span [-59, -48]. But wait, the problem says for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [tau, h]\" meaning [tail, head]? And then it moves right.\n\nBut in the data, the first car on freeway1 is given as: (-48, -59, right, 4). So head=-48, tail=-59. Then the initial span at t1=28 is [tail, head] = [-59, -48]. Similarly, the next car: head=-12, tail=-23 -> span [-23, -12]. The third car: head=24, tail=13 -> [13,24].\n\nSo the update for a right-moving car at time T (>=28) is:\n  tail_T = tail_initial + s*(T-28)\n  head_T = head_initial + s*(T-28)\n\nAnd the car covers the interval [tail_T, head_T].\n\nCollision occurs at time T on freeway k if the player is at (0, k) and there exists a car on freeway k such that 0 is in [tail_T, head_T].\n\nNow, the player starts at (0,0) at turn 28. We want to get to (0,9). The player can move up (U: y+1), down (D: y-1), or stay (S: y same). But note: the grid is from y=0 to y=9. So we cannot go below 0 or above 9.\n\nWe are to find the minimal H and the sequence of actions from turn 28 to turn 28+H-1 such that at the end we are at y=9.\n\nSince we start at 0 and need to get to 9, we must go up at least 9 times. But we can also go down or stay, so the minimal number of moves without any obstacles would be 9 (all U). However, we have to avoid collisions on rows 1 to 8.\n\nWe must check for each freeway (row 1 to 8) at each turn if the player is on that row, then the cars on that row must not cover 0 at that turn.\n\nWe are to simulate from turn 28 onward.\n\nFirst, let's compute the positions of the cars at any turn T (>=28) for each freeway.\n\nWe'll denote:\nFor a car: (head, tail, d, s) -> but all d='right'\n\nSo for a car, at time T:\n  tail(T) = tail_initial + s*(T-28)\n  head(T) = head_initial + s*(T-28)\n\nWe need to check for each row k (1..8) and for each car on that row, if at time T, 0 is in [tail(T), head(T)].\n\nBut note: the player is at row y_T at time T. So we only care about the cars on row y_T at time T.\n\nWe are to plan a path: sequence of actions (U, D, S) that moves the player from y=0 at T=28 to y=9 at some T=28+H-1, without any collision.\n\nWe want minimal H.\n\nWe can consider a BFS over the state: (turn, y) but note that turn can be large? However, the cars move continuously and we only care about when they cover 0. But note that the car positions are linear in time, so we can compute the times when a car covers 0.\n\nAlternatively, we can simulate turn by turn. Since we want minimal H, the path should not have unnecessary delays. We can try to go up as fast as possible, but if we see a collision, we might have to wait (stay) or even go down to avoid.\n\nBut note: we start at y=0 at turn28. We cannot go below 0. And we must reach y=9.\n\nLet me list the cars for each row:\n\nRow 1 (freeway1): three cars\n  Car1: head=-48, tail=-59, s=4 -> at time T: tail(T) = -59 + 4*(T-28), head(T) = -48 + 4*(T-28)\n  Car2: head=-12, tail=-23, s=4 -> tail(T)=-23+4*(T-28), head(T)=-12+4*(T-28)\n  Car3: head=24, tail=13, s=4 -> tail(T)=13+4*(T-28), head(T)=24+4*(T-28)\n\nRow 2: same as row1? \n  It's given: same three cars? So the same as row1.\n\nBut note: row2 is a different freeway. So we have the same set of cars? That seems odd, but it's given.\n\nRow3: \n  Car1: head=48, tail=37, s=6 -> tail(T)=37+6*(T-28), head(T)=48+6*(T-28)\n  Car2: head=12, tail=1, s=6 -> tail(T)=1+6*(T-28), head(T)=12+6*(T-28)\n  Car3: head=-24, tail=-35, s=6 -> tail(T)=-35+6*(T-28), head(T)=-24+6*(T-28)\n\nRow4: same as row3.\n\nRow5: \n  Car1: head=48, tail=37, s=12 -> tail(T)=37+12*(T-28), head(T)=48+12*(T-28)\n  Car2: head=12, tail=1, s=12 -> tail(T)=1+12*(T-28), head(T)=12+12*(T-28)\n  Car3: head=-24, tail=-35, s=12 -> tail(T)=-35+12*(T-28), head(T)=-24+12*(T-28)\n\nRow6: only one car\n  Car: head=48, tail=37, s=3 -> tail(T)=37+3*(T-28), head(T)=48+3*(T-28)\n\nRow7: one car\n  Car: head=-48, tail=-71, s=24 -> tail(T)=-71+24*(T-28), head(T)=-48+24*(T-28)\n\nRow8: same as row7.\n\nWe need to check for each row k and for each time T, if the player is at row k at time T, then none of the cars on row k has 0 in [tail(T), head(T)].\n\nWe can precompute for each row k the time intervals when 0 is covered by any car on that row. Then we know that if the player is on row k at time T, then T must not be in any of those intervals.\n\nBut note: a row might have multiple cars, and each car covers 0 for a continuous interval of time.\n\nLet me compute for each row the set of time intervals (if any) when 0 is covered.\n\nWe solve for a car: \n  0 in [tail(T), head(T)] \n  <=> tail(T) <= 0 <= head(T)\n\nFor a car with tail_initial, head_initial, s:\n\n  tail_initial + s*(T-28) <= 0 <= head_initial + s*(T-28)\n\nWe can solve for T:\n\n  T >= 28 + (-tail_initial)/s   [if s>0] and T <= 28 + (-head_initial)/s? \n\nActually, from:\n  tail_initial + s*(T-28) <= 0  => T-28 >= (-tail_initial)/s   -> T >= 28 + ceil( (-tail_initial) / s )? \nBut note: because T is integer? And the inequality is continuous, but since we are at integer T, we can compute the real interval and then take integer T in [T_start, T_end]?\n\nBut actually, the condition is continuous, and T is integer. So the interval for T is:\n\n  T >= 28 + ceil( (-tail_initial) / s ) ? \nWait, let me rearrange:\n\n  tail_initial + s*(T-28) <= 0   => s*(T-28) <= -tail_initial   => T-28 <= (-tail_initial)/s   [if s>0]\n\nBut note: the inequality direction: \n  tail_initial + s*(T-28) <= 0 \n  => T-28 <= (-tail_initial)/s\n\nSimilarly, \n  0 <= head_initial + s*(T-28) \n  => s*(T-28) >= -head_initial \n  => T-28 >= (-head_initial)/s   [if s>0]\n\nSo we have:\n  T-28 >= (-head_initial)/s   and   T-28 <= (-tail_initial)/s\n\nBut note: because tail_initial <= head_initial (for a right-moving car), then (-head_initial) <= (-tail_initial) and so the interval is:\n\n  T-28 in [ (-head_initial)/s, (-tail_initial)/s ]\n\nSo the integer T must satisfy:\n  ceil( (-head_initial)/s ) <= T-28 <= floor( (-tail_initial)/s )\n\nBut note: we require both inequalities to hold. Let me test with a car.\n\nExample: row1, car1: head=-48, tail=-59, s=4.\n\nThen:\n  T-28 >= (-(-48))/4 = 48/4 = 12\n  T-28 <= (-(-59))/4 = 59/4 = 14.75\n\nSo T-28 must be in [12, 14.75] -> so integer T-28: 12,13,14.\n\nThus T: 40,41,42.\n\nSimilarly, car2: head=-12, tail=-23, s=4.\n  T-28 >= (-(-12))/4 = 12/4 = 3\n  T-28 <= (-(-23))/4 = 23/4 = 5.75\n  => T-28: 3,4,5 -> T: 31,32,33\n\nCar3: head=24, tail=13, s=4.\n  T-28 >= (-24)/4 = -6 -> no lower bound? Actually, the condition for the head: \n    0 <= head_initial + s*(T-28) -> 0 <= 24 + 4*(T-28) -> 4*(T-28) >= -24 -> T-28 >= -6 -> which is always true for T>=28.\n  And the tail condition: tail_initial + s*(T-28) <=0 -> 13 +4*(T-28)<=0 -> 4*(T-28)<=-13 -> T-28<= -13/4 = -3.25 -> which is impossible for T>=28.\n\nSo car3 never covers 0.\n\nTherefore, for row1, 0 is covered by car1 at T=40,41,42 and by car2 at T=31,32,33.\n\nSimilarly, row2 is same as row1? So same dangerous times: T=31,32,33 and 40,41,42.\n\nNow row3: \nCar1: head=48, tail=37, s=6\n  Conditions:\n    T-28 >= (-48)/6 = -8 -> always true for T>=28.\n    T-28 <= (-37)/6 ≈ -6.166 -> which is <28, so no solution? So never covers 0.\n\nCar2: head=12, tail=1, s=6\n  T-28 >= (-12)/6 = -2 -> always true for T>=28.\n  T-28 <= (-1)/6 ≈ -0.166 -> impossible? So never.\n\nCar3: head=-24, tail=-35, s=6\n  T-28 >= (-(-24))/6 = 24/6=4\n  T-28 <= (-(-35))/6 = 35/6≈5.833\n  -> T-28: 4,5 -> T=32,33\n\nSo row3: dangerous at T=32,33.\n\nRow4: same as row3 -> T=32,33.\n\nRow5: \nCar1: s=12\n  T-28>= (-48)/12 = -4 -> always true\n  T-28<= (-37)/12≈-3.08 -> impossible -> never.\n\nCar2: s=12\n  T-28>= (-12)/12 = -1 -> always true\n  T-28<= (-1)/12≈-0.083 -> impossible -> never.\n\nCar3: head=-24, tail=-35, s=12\n  T-28>= (-(-24))/12=24/12=2\n  T-28<= (-(-35))/12=35/12≈2.916\n  -> T-28: 2 -> only T=30? Because 2.916 -> integers: 2 and 3? Wait, T-28 must be integer, so [2, 2.916] -> T-28=2 -> T=30? \n  But let me check: \n    At T=30: \n      tail(30) = -35 + 12*(30-28) = -35+24=-11\n      head(30)= -24+24=0 -> so 0 is included? [tail, head] = [-11,0] -> 0 is included? Yes, at the endpoint? The problem says \"if 0 in Span\", so yes.\n    At T=31: tail(31)= -35+12*3=-35+36=1, head(31)= -24+36=12 -> [1,12] -> 0 not included.\n    So only T=30.\n\nBut wait: the condition: \n  T-28>=2 and T-28<=35/12≈2.916 -> so T-28=2 only? Because 3>2.916 -> so T=30.\n\nBut at T=30: head(30)= -24+12*2=0 -> so [tail(30), head(30)] = [-35+24, 0] = [-11,0] -> 0 is included.\n\nSo row5: dangerous only at T=30.\n\nRow6: one car: head=48, tail=37, s=3\n  Conditions:\n    T-28>= (-48)/3 = -16 -> always true\n    T-28<= (-37)/3 ≈ -12.33 -> impossible -> never dangerous.\n\nRow7: one car: head=-48, tail=-71, s=24\n  Conditions:\n    T-28>= (-(-48))/24=48/24=2\n    T-28<= (-(-71))/24=71/24≈2.958\n  -> T-28: 2 -> T=30? \n  Check: at T=30: \n    tail(30)= -71+24*2=-71+48=-23\n    head(30)= -48+48=0 -> so [ -23, 0] -> 0 included.\n  At T=31: tail(31)= -71+24*3=-71+72=1, head(31)= -48+72=24 -> [1,24] -> 0 not included.\n  So only T=30.\n\nRow8: same as row7 -> dangerous at T=30.\n\nSummary of dangerous times for each row:\n\nRow1: T=31,32,33 (from car2) and T=40,41,42 (from car1)\nRow2: same as row1 -> 31,32,33 and 40,41,42\nRow3: T=32,33\nRow4: same as row3 -> 32,33\nRow5: T=30\nRow6: never\nRow7: T=30\nRow8: T=30\n\nWe can now plan the path.\n\nWe start at turn28 at y=0.\n\nWe need to get to y=9. The minimal moves would be 9 steps (if we go up 9 times) but we have to avoid being on a row at a dangerous time.\n\nWe note:\n- We must traverse rows 1 to 8. We start at row0 and end at row9, so rows 1 to 8 are the freeways we must pass through.\n\nWe can simulate step by step.\n\nWe are to find a path: sequence of actions (U, D, S) that moves the player.\n\nWe want minimal H, so we try to go up as much as possible, but if we are forced to wait (stay) or even go down to avoid a collision, we do so.\n\nWe can use BFS in the state (time, y) where time is the turn (starting at 28) and y in [0,9]. We want to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nState: (t, y) at turn t, the player is at (0,y). We start at (28,0). We want to reach (t,9) for some t.\n\nWe simulate actions: from state (t,y), we can go to (t+1, y') with y' = y, y+1, or y-1 (if within [0,9]).\n\nBut we must check: when we are at (t,y), if y is between 1 and 8, then we must not have a collision at time t on row y.\n\nNote: at the starting state (28,0): we are at y=0, which is not a freeway (freeways are 1-8), so no collision check.\n\nSimilarly, at the end, we are at (t,9): 9 is not a freeway, so no collision.\n\nBut during the journey, when we are on y in {1,...,8} at time t, we must check the dangerous times for that row.\n\nWe have precomputed for each row the dangerous time points. So for row k, we have a set of dangerous times.\n\nWe can define:\n\ndangerous_times = {\n  1: {31,32,33,40,41,42},\n  2: {31,32,33,40,41,42},\n  3: {32,33},\n  4: {32,33},\n  5: {30},\n  6: set(),\n  7: {30},\n  8: {30}\n}\n\nNow, we run BFS:\n\nWe'll use a queue: each element is (t, y, path) where t is the current turn, y is the current row, and path is the sequence of actions taken from turn28 to turn t-1 (so the next action will be for turn t).\n\nWe start at (28, 0, []).\n\nWe want to reach a state where y=9. Then we output the path (and H = number of actions = length of path, and the last turn is t).\n\nBut note: when we are at (t,9), we are done. The last action that brought us to 9 was at turn t-1? Let me clarify:\n\nAt turn t, we are at y_t. The action we take at turn t determines y_{t+1}.\n\nSo if we start at turn28: we are at y28=0.\n\nThen we take action at turn28 to go to y29.\n\nThen at turn29, we are at y29.\n\nSo when we are at state (t, y), we have already taken actions for turns 28 to t-1. The next action we choose will be at turn t and will lead to y_{t+1}.\n\nBut we are required to output the actions for turns starting at t1=28. So when we are at state (t,y), we have taken t-28 actions.\n\nWe want to stop when we are at (t,9) for some t. Then the number of actions is t-28.\n\nWe must avoid states that we have visited with a higher or same turn and same or lower y? But we can also go down, so we cannot prune by y. We can use (t,y) as state and if we have been at (t,y) before, we skip.\n\nWe are to minimize t (the turn when we reach y=9). So we do BFS by time: we consider increasing t.\n\nBut note: the state space: t can go up to ...? The dangerous times go up to 42, so we might have to go beyond 42.\n\nWe'll simulate until we reach y=9.\n\nLet me start:\n\nInitial: (28, 0, path=[])\n\nAt turn28, we are at y=0. We can choose U, D, S.\n\nBut note: if we go D: y29 = 0-1 = -1 -> not allowed. So only U or S.\n\nOption1: S -> next state: (29,0, path=['S'])\nOption2: U -> next state: (29,1, path=['U'])\n\nNow, at state (29,0): safe because y=0 is not a freeway.\n\nAt state (29,1): now y=1 (freeway) at time t=29. Check dangerous times for row1: {31,32,33,40,41,42} -> 29 not in there, so safe.\n\nFrom (29,0): \n  Actions: \n    U -> (30,1) -> then at turn30, y=1 -> check: 30 not in {31,32,...} -> safe.\n    S -> (30,0) -> safe (y=0)\n    D -> invalid.\n\nFrom (29,1):\n  Actions:\n    U -> (30,2)\n    S -> (30,1)\n    D -> (30,0)\n\nWe need to check safety at state (t,y) at the time t.\n\nWe'll build a table:\n\nWe'll do BFS and we mark visited states (t,y) to avoid cycles.\n\nWe want minimal turn when we reach y=9.\n\nLet me do step by step until we get to y=9.\n\nWe'll use a queue.\n\nInitialize: \n  queue: [ (28,0,[]) ]\n\nMark visited: set of (t,y)\n\nWhile queue not empty:\n  pop state (t,y,path)\n  if y==9: we found a solution: path, H = len(path) = t-28? Actually, the path has (t-28) actions (from turn28 to turn t-1). The next turn we haven't taken an action yet. But at turn t we are at y=9, so we are done. We output the actions for turns 28 to t-1.\n\nBut note: we are at (t,9) meaning we arrived at y=9 at turn t. The actions taken are for turns 28 to t-1. So we have H = t-28.\n\nWe want minimal H, so we do BFS and the first time we reach y=9, we return.\n\nNow, from a state (t,y), we can do U, D, S (if the next y is in [0,9]). Then the next state is (t+1, y_new) and the new path = path + [action].\n\nBut we must check: at the next state (t+1, y_new), if y_new is between 1 and 8, then we must check that t+1 is not in dangerous_times[y_new].\n\nIf it is, then we skip that action.\n\nAlso, if we have visited (t+1, y_new) before, we skip.\n\nLet me start:\n\nStep0: (28,0,[]) -> \n  Actions: U -> (29,1) -> not visited, and at t=29, y=1: check row1 -> dangerous times: {31,32,33,40,41,42} -> 29 not in -> safe -> push (29,1,['U'])\n        S -> (29,0) -> safe -> push (29,0,['S'])\n\nStep1: \n  Process (29,1,['U']): \n    Actions: \n      U -> (30,2): at t=30, y=2 -> dangerous_times[2] = {31,32,33,40,41,42} -> 30 not in -> safe -> push (30,2,['U','U'])\n      S -> (30,1): at t=30, y=1 -> dangerous_times[1] doesn't have 30 -> safe -> push (30,1,['U','S'])\n      D -> (30,0): safe -> push (30,0,['U','D'])\n\n  Process (29,0,['S']):\n    Actions:\n      U -> (30,1): as above, safe -> but we already have (30,1) from above? But we haven't visited it yet. We can have multiple ways to same state? But we want minimal H, so if we get to the same state (t,y) by two paths, the one that got here earlier is better. But we are doing BFS by time, so the first time we get to (t,y) is the earliest. So we mark visited per (t,y).\n\n    So for (30,1): we already pushed one path? Actually, we push both? But we can mark (30,1) as visited when we first get there. Since we are doing BFS by time (t increasing), we will get the minimal path.\n\n    However, we are processing in increasing t. So at t=29, we process two states. Then at t=30, we process the children.\n\n    So for (29,0,['S']):\n      U -> (30,1): we push it even if we have another (30,1) from the other branch? But we can avoid duplicates: we maintain a visited set for (t,y).\n\nLet me do:\n\nvisited = set()\nqueue = deque([(28,0,[])])\n\nwhile queue:\n   pop state (t,y,path)\n   if (t,y) in visited: skip\n   else: mark visited.add((t,y))\n\n   if y==9: return path\n\n   for action in ['U','D','S']:\n        y_next = y + (1 if action=='U' else (-1 if action=='D' else 0)\n        if y_next not in [0,9] or (y_next>=1 and y_next<=8): then we have to check the dangerous times at time t+1 for row y_next? Actually, no: we are going to be at (t+1, y_next). And if y_next is in [1,8], then at time t+1 we are on freeway y_next -> we must check that t+1 is not in dangerous_times[y_next].\n\n        Also, if y_next is 0 or 9, then no need to check.\n\n        And if y_next is not in [0,9] (like negative or >9) then skip.\n\n        So if y_next in [0,9] and (if y_next in [1,8] then t+1 not in dangerous_times[y_next] else True) and (t+1, y_next) not visited, then push (t+1, y_next, path+[action])\n\nBut note: we must check the next state (t+1, y_next) for collision: if y_next in [1,8] then we require that t+1 is not in the dangerous set for that row.\n\nLet me code this in simulation.\n\nWe'll simulate until we get to y=9.\n\nWe have:\n\ndangerous = {\n  1: {31,32,33,40,41,42},\n  2: {31,32,33,40,41,42},\n  3: {32,33},\n  4: {32,33},\n  5: {30},\n  6: set(),\n  7: {30},\n  8: {30}\n}\n\nWe start:\n\nt=28, y=0 -> not visited -> mark (28,0) visited.\n\nActions: \n  U: y_next=1 -> then at t=29, row1: check if 29 in dangerous[1]? 29 not in -> safe. Then state (29,1) -> not visited -> push with path ['U']\n  S: y_next=0 -> then at t=29, row0 -> safe. Then state (29,0) -> push with path ['S']\n  D: y_next=-1 -> invalid.\n\nNow queue: [ (29,1,['U']), (29,0,['S']) ]\n\nProcess (29,1,['U']): \n  Actions:\n    U: y_next=2 -> at t=30, row2: check dangerous[2]: {31,32,...} -> 30 not in -> safe. Push (30,2,['U','U'])\n    S: y_next=1 -> at t=30, row1: dangerous[1] doesn't have 30 -> safe. Push (30,1,['U','S'])\n    D: y_next=0 -> at t=30, row0 -> safe. Push (30,0,['U','D'])\n\nProcess (29,0,['S']):\n  Actions:\n    U: y_next=1 -> at t=30, row1: safe -> push (30,1,['S','U']) -> but we already have (30,1) from above? But we haven't processed it yet. We'll mark when we pop. So we push it and later when we pop (30,1) we mark it as visited and skip duplicates? But we are doing BFS by time, so we process all states at t=29 then t=30. So at t=30, we might have two states with (30,1). We can avoid by checking visited when pushing? \n\n  We mark visited when we pop, not when we push? Because we might have multiple ways to the same state at the same time? Actually, no: we are at the same time and same y. So we should mark visited when we push? Or when we pop? \n\n  To avoid duplicate states, we can check visited when we are about to push. We'll mark a state (t,y) as visited as soon as we push it.\n\n  But note: two different paths might lead to the same (t,y). We want the first one that gets to (t,y) because we are doing BFS by time. So we can mark visited at push.\n\n  So we maintain a set visited, and when we generate (t_next, y_next), if (t_next, y_next) is not visited, we push and mark it visited.\n\n  This way, each state (t,y) is expanded only once.\n\nWe adjust:\n\nvisited = set()\nqueue = deque()\n\nstart: (28,0,[]) -> visited.add((28,0)); push.\n\nThen:\n\nwhile queue:\n   pop state (t,y,path)\n   if y==9: return path\n\n   for action in ['U','D','S']:\n        y_next = y + delta\n        if y_next <0 or y_next>9: skip\n        t_next = t+1\n        if y_next in [1,8] and t_next in dangerous[y_next]: skip (because collision)\n        else:\n            if (t_next, y_next) not in visited:\n                visited.add((t_next, y_next))\n                push (t_next, y_next, path+[action])\n\nNow, back to:\n\nAt t=28: we pushed (29,1) and (29,0).\n\nNow we pop (29,1): \n   We push: \n      (30,2) -> new -> push with ['U','U'] -> mark visited (30,2)\n      (30,1) -> new -> push with ['U','S'] -> mark (30,1)\n      (30,0) -> new -> push with ['U','D'] -> mark (30,0)\n\nPop (29,0): \n   Actions: \n      U: (30,1) -> (30,1) is already visited? We marked it when we pushed the first one. So skip.\n      S: (30,0) -> visited? yes -> skip.\n      D: invalid.\n\nSo queue now: [ (30,2,['U','U']), (30,1,['U','S']), (30,0,['U','D']) ]\n\nProcess (30,2,['U','U']): \n   Actions:\n      U: y_next=3 -> t_next=31 -> check row3: dangerous[3]={32,33} -> 31 not in -> safe. Push (31,3,['U','U','U']) -> mark (31,3)\n      S: y_next=2 -> row2: dangerous[2] has 31? yes, because 31 in {31,32,33,...} -> so collision at t=31 on row2? \n          But wait: if we stay at row2 at time 31, then we are on row2 at time 31 -> and dangerous[2] includes 31 -> collision. So skip.\n      D: y_next=1 -> row1: at time31, row1: dangerous[1] has 31 -> collision -> skip.\n\n   So only U is possible: (31,3,['U','U','U'])\n\nProcess (30,1,['U','S']): \n   Actions:\n      U: (31,2) -> at t=31, row2: dangerous -> 31 in dangerous[2] -> collision -> skip.\n      S: (31,1) -> row1: 31 in dangerous[1] -> collision -> skip.\n      D: (31,0) -> safe -> push (31,0,['U','S','D']) -> mark (31,0)\n\nProcess (30,0,['U','D']): \n   Actions:\n      U: (31,1) -> row1: 31 in dangerous[1] -> skip.\n      S: (31,0) -> safe -> push (31,0,['U','D','S']) -> but (31,0) is not visited? We are about to push (31,0) from the previous state? But we haven't pushed it yet. \n          Actually, we are processing (30,0) and we are going to push (31,0) for the first time? \n          But note: we just pushed (31,0) from the state above? So we mark visited when we push. So when we try to push (31,0) from (30,0) we see it's already visited? \n\n   We must be consistent: we mark as soon as we push. So from (30,1) we pushed (31,0) and marked it. Then from (30,0) we try to push (31,0) and it is visited -> skip.\n\n      D: invalid.\n\n   So only S: but we skip because (31,0) is already pushed.\n\nNow queue: [ (31,3,['U','U','U']), (31,0,['U','S','D']) ]\n\nProcess (31,3,['U','U','U']): \n   Actions:\n      U: y_next=4 -> t_next=32 -> row4: dangerous[4]={32,33} -> 32 is in -> collision -> skip.\n      S: y_next=3 -> row3: dangerous[3] has 32 -> collision -> skip.\n      D: y_next=2 -> row2: dangerous[2] has 32? yes -> collision -> skip.\n\n   So no action? Then we cannot proceed from here. This state is a dead end.\n\nProcess (31,0,['U','S','D']): \n   Actions:\n      U: (32,1) -> at t=32, row1: dangerous[1] has 32 -> collision -> skip.\n      S: (32,0) -> safe -> push (32,0,['U','S','D','S']) -> mark (32,0)\n      D: invalid.\n\nNow queue: [ (32,0,['U','S','D','S']) ]\n\nProcess (32,0,['U','S','D','S']): \n   Actions:\n      U: (33,1) -> row1: dangerous[1] has 33 -> collision? 33 is in -> skip.\n      S: (33,0) -> safe -> push (33,0, path+['S']) -> mark (33,0)\n      D: invalid.\n\nNow queue: [ (33,0,['U','S','D','S','S']) ]\n\nProcess (33,0, ...): \n   Actions:\n      U: (34,1) -> row1: dangerous[1] has {31,32,33,40,41,42} -> 34 not in -> safe. Push (34,1, path+['U']) -> mark (34,1)\n\n      S: (34,0) -> safe -> push (34,0, path+['S'])\n      D: invalid.\n\nNow queue: [ (34,1,['U','S','D','S','S','U']), (34,0,['U','S','D','S','S','S']) ]\n\nProcess (34,1): \n   Actions:\n      U: (35,2) -> row2: dangerous[2] has 35? {31,32,33,40,41,42} -> 35 not in -> safe. Push (35,2, path+['U']) -> mark (35,2)\n      S: (35,1) -> row1: 35 not in -> safe. Push (35,1, path+['S'])\n      D: (35,0) -> safe. Push (35,0, path+['D'])\n\nProcess (34,0): \n   Actions:\n      U: (35,1) -> safe -> push (35,1, ...) but we are going to push multiple (35,1)? We mark visited when we push the first one.\n\nWe'll skip the details for (34,0) because we already have (35,1) from (34,1). But we'll simulate.\n\nFrom (34,0): \n   U: (35,1) -> not visited? We haven't pushed it from (34,1) yet? Actually, we process states in order of increasing time. We process (34,1) first and push (35,2), (35,1), (35,0). Then we process (34,0) and then when we try (35,1) we see it's already visited? \n\nBut we are doing BFS and we want minimal H, so we don't care about multiple paths as long as we get to the goal.\n\nBut to save time, we can avoid duplicates.\n\nNow, let me continue from (35,2): which we got from (34,1) then U.\n\nAt (35,2): \n   Actions:\n      U: (36,3) -> row3: dangerous[3]={32,33} -> 36 not in -> safe. Push (36,3, ...)\n      S: (36,2) -> row2: 36 not in dangerous[2]? dangerous[2]={31,32,33,40,41,42} -> 36 not in -> safe. Push (36,2)\n      D: (36,1) -> row1: 36 not in -> safe. Push (36,1)\n\nWe are moving forward.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid row5 at t=30, row7 and row8 at t=30, but we are at t=35, so that time has passed.\n\nHowever, we also have later dangerous times: row1 and row2 at t=40,41,42.\n\nWe are at t=35, so we might get to the higher rows without waiting? \n\nBut let's see if we can go straight up.\n\nFrom (35,2) we go U: to (36,3) -> then U to (37,4) -> then U to (38,5) -> then U to (39,6) -> then U to (40,7) -> but at t=40, we are at row7? dangerous[7]={30} -> 40 not in -> safe? \nBut row7 has only one dangerous time at t=30, so yes.\n\nBut then we go to (41,8): row8: dangerous[8]={30} -> safe.\nThen (42,9): done? \n\nBut wait: at t=40, we are at row7 -> safe. Then at t=41, we are at row8: safe. Then at t=42, we are at row9 -> done.\n\nSo the sequence: from (35,2): \n   U (to3), U (to4), U (to5), U (to6), U (to7), U (to8), U (to9)\n\nThat would be 7 moves from (35,2) -> so total turns from start: \n   at (35,2): we have taken 35-28 = 7 moves? \n   Then 7 more moves? So total 14 moves -> turn42.\n\nBut let's check the actions: we start at turn28: \n   ... we have a path to (35,2) in 7 moves? Actually, from (28,0) to (35,2): 7 moves? \n   We have: \n        t28: start0\n        t29: 1 (from U)\n        t30: 2 (from U)\n        then we got stuck at t31: we went down to 0? \n        then we stayed until t34:0 -> then at t34: U to 1, then at t35: U to 2? \n        So from t28 to t35: 7 moves? Actually, the state at t35: we are at y=2 -> so we have taken 7 actions? \n\n   Then from t35: we do 7 U's: \n        t35: at y=2 -> action U -> t36: y=3\n        t36: U -> t37:4\n        t37: U->t38:5\n        t38: U->t39:6\n        t39: U->t40:7\n        t40: U->t41:8\n        t41: U->t42:9\n\n   So we reach y=9 at turn42.\n\n   The total actions: 7 (to get to (35,2)) + 7 = 14 actions? \n\n   But the path we have for the first part: \n        (28,0) -> (29,1): U\n        (29,1) -> (30,2): U\n        then from (30,2) we went to (31,3) by U -> but then at (31,3) we were stuck? \n        Then we backtracked and went down to (31,0) and then stayed until (34,0) and then up to (34,1) and then (35,2).\n\n   How many moves to (35,2): \n        t28: action0: U -> to 1\n        t29: U -> to 2\n        t30: then we tried to go to (31,3) but that didn't work? \n        Actually, we went from (30,2) to (31,3) -> but then at (31,3) we had no valid move? Then we tried other states.\n\n   We ended up at (35,2) via: \n        ['U','S','D','S','S','U','U']? \n        Let me count: \n            t28: U -> to1 at t29\n            t29: S -> stay at1 at t30? But then we had (30,1) from ['U','S'] -> then from (30,1): we did D to (31,0) -> then S at t31: to (32,0) -> then S at t32: to (33,0) -> then S at t33: to (34,0) -> then U at t34: to (35,1) -> then U at t35: to (36,2)? \n\n        Actually, no: at (34,1) we did U -> (35,2): so the path to (35,2) is: \n            t28: U\n            t29: S -> then we went to (30,1) -> then D to (31,0) -> then S to (32,0) -> then S to (33,0) -> then at t33: we did U to (34,1) -> then at t34: we did U to (35,2)\n\n        So actions: \n            t28: U\n            t29: S\n            t30: D\n            t31: S\n            t32: S\n            t33: U\n            t34: U\n        -> 7 actions -> at t35, we are at y=2.\n\n        Then from t35 to t42: 7 more actions: all U.\n\n        So total 14 actions.\n\n        The sequence of actions: \n            t28: U\n            t29: S\n            t30: D\n            t31: S\n            t32: S\n            t33: U\n            t34: U\n            t35: U\n            t36: U\n            t37: U\n            t38: U\n            t39: U\n            t40: U\n            t41: U\n\n        Then at turn41: we take the last U to go to y=9 at turn42.\n\n        But wait: at turn41, we are at y=8? Then we take U and at turn42 we are at y=9.\n\n        Now, check collisions:\n\n        We need to simulate the entire path to check.\n\n        Let me write the y at each turn:\n\n        t28: 0\n        t29: 1 (action U) -> check row1 at t29: safe? dangerous[1] doesn't have 29 -> safe.\n        t30: 1 (action S) -> at t30, row1: safe? dangerous[1] doesn't have 30 -> safe.\n        t31: 0 (action D) -> safe (row0)\n        t32: 0 (action S)\n        t33: 0 (action S)\n        t34: 1 (action U) -> at t34, row1: dangerous[1] has 34? no -> safe.\n        t35: 2 (action U) -> at t35, row2: dangerous[2] has 35? no -> safe.\n        t36: 3 (U) -> row3: dangerous[3]={32,33} -> 36 not in -> safe.\n        t37: 4 (U) -> row4: dangerous[4]={32,33} -> safe.\n        t38: 5 (U) -> row5: dangerous[5]={30} -> safe.\n        t39: 6 (U) -> row6: never dangerous -> safe.\n        t40: 7 (U) -> row7: dangerous[7]={30} -> safe.\n        t41: 8 (U) -> row8: dangerous[8]={30} -> safe.\n        t42: 9 (U) -> done.\n\n        So it's safe.\n\n        Total H = 14? But note: we have 14 actions, from turn28 to turn41 (inclusive) -> 14 actions. Then at turn42 we are at 9.\n\n        The problem says: sequence of actions for t from 0 to H-1? Here H is the number of turns? \n\n        We started at turn28, and we ended at turn28+H-1 = 42 -> so 42 = 28 + H - 1 -> H = 42-28+1 = 15? \n\n        But we have 14 actions? \n\n        Clarification: \n            Turn t1: a_{t1} ... until a_{t1+H-1} such that after H actions, we are at turn t1+H and position (0,9).\n\n        The player update: \n            y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t, where the action a_t is applied at turn t to get y_{t+1}.\n\n        So we take actions at turns: 28,29,...,28+H-1, and then at turn 28+H we are at y=9.\n\n        Therefore, H is the number of actions. And we are at (0,9) at turn 28+H.\n\n        So in our case, at turn42 we are at 9, so 28+H=42 -> H=14.\n\n        So the answer is 14 actions.\n\nBut is this minimal? We had to wait from t30 to t33? \n\nAlternatively, we might have found a faster path.\n\nNote: we started at (28,0). We must avoid row1 at t31,32,33 and row2 at same times, row3 and row4 at t32,33, row5,7,8 at t30.\n\nWe tried to go up quickly and got blocked at t31 at row3? Then we had to retreat.\n\nBut maybe we could have gone slower initially.\n\nLet me try a different path: start by staying at 0 until after the dangerous times for the lower rows? \n\nFor example, we cannot be on row5,7,8 at t30 -> so we should avoid being on these rows at t30. But we are at 0 at t30? Then we are safe.\n\nThen we cannot be on row1,2 at t31,32,33 -> so we should avoid being on rows 1,2 during t31,32,33.\n\nAlso, rows3,4 during t32,33.\n\nSo we can plan:\n\nAt t28: S (stay at0)\nt29: S (stay at0)\nt30: S (stay at0) -> safe\nThen after t30, the dangerous times for row5,7,8 are over.\n\nNow, we must avoid rows1,2 at t31,32,33 and rows3,4 at t32,33.\n\nWe can start moving up at t30: \n   t30: at0 -> then U to1 at t31? \n        but at t31: we are at row1 -> dangerous (31 in dangerous[1]) -> collision.\n\n   So we cannot go to row1 at t31.\n\n   We could go to row1 at t30? \n        t30: at0 -> U -> at t31: row1 -> but t31 is dangerous -> no.\n\n   Alternatively, we could stay at0 at t30, then at t31: still at0 -> safe, then at t31: U to1 at t32? \n        at t32: row1 -> dangerous (32 in dangerous[1]) -> collision.\n\n   Similarly, we must avoid row1 until at least t34.\n\nSo we stay at0 until t33: \n   t28:0, t29:0, t30:0, t31:0, t32:0, t33:0 -> safe.\n\nThen at t33: U to1 at t34 -> safe (row1 at t34: not dangerous)\n\nThen we can go up freely? \n\nBut then:\n   t34:1 -> U to2 at t35: safe (row2 at t35: not dangerous)\n   t35:2 -> U to3 at36: safe\n   t36:3 -> U to4 at37: safe\n   t37:4 -> U to5 at38: safe\n   t38:5 -> U to6 at39: safe\n   t39:6 -> U to7 at40: safe (row7 dangerous only at30)\n   t40:7 -> U to8 at41: safe\n   t41:8 -> U to9 at42.\n\nTotal actions: from t28 to t41: 14 actions? \n   t28: S, t29:S, t30:S, t31:S, t32:S, t33:U, t34:U, t35:U, t36:U, t37:U, t38:U, t39:U, t40:U, t41:U -> 14 actions.\n\nSame length as the previous path.\n\nBut note: the previous path had 14 actions and this one too.\n\nBut in the first path we moved up earlier and then had to come down and wait? But we ended up with the same length.\n\nCan we do better? \n\nMinimal moves: 9 moves (all U) but we have to avoid the dangerous times. \n\nIf we try to go straight up:\n\nt28: U -> t29:1 -> safe\nt29: U -> t30:2 -> at t30: row2 -> dangerous? row2 dangerous at t30? no -> safe.\nt30: U -> t31:3 -> at t31: row3 -> dangerous? row3: dangerous at 32,33 -> not 31 -> safe.\nt31: U -> t32:4 -> at t32: row4 -> dangerous? yes, 32 in dangerous[4] -> collision.\n\nSo we cannot.\n\nAlternative: at t30: instead of U, we do S or D? \n   If at t30: we are at2 -> then S: stay at2 at t31: row2 at t31: dangerous -> collision.\n   D: to1 at t31: row1: dangerous.\n\nSo we must leave row2 before t31? \n\nBut we arrived at row2 at t30. Then we cannot stay or go down? \n\nSo we must go up? But then we hit row3 at t31: which is safe? \n   Then at t31: row3 -> safe? \n        dangerous[3] at t31: no, because dangerous at 32,33.\n   Then at t31: we can do U to4 at t32: row4 at t32: dangerous -> collision.\n\n   Or we do S: stay at3 at t32: row3 at t32: dangerous -> collision.\n\n   Or D: to2 at t32: row2 at t32: dangerous.\n\nSo we are stuck.\n\nTherefore, we cannot go straight up.\n\nWe must wait somewhere.\n\nWe have two paths of 14 moves. \n\nBut note: there is a path that we found earlier that also takes 14 moves: \n   U, S, D, S, S, U, U, then 7 U's.\n\nIs there a path with 13 moves? \n\nWe need to get to 9 in 13 moves: meaning at turn28+13 = turn41 we are at9.\n\nBut then we must be at row9 at turn41.\n\nWe must cover 9 units in 13 moves? We can do that with 9 U's and 4 S or D? But D would be counterproductive. \n\nWe must have at least 9 U's. The other 4 moves can be S or D. But D would require extra U to compensate, so it would increase the number of moves. Therefore, minimal moves without obstacles is 9, but with obstacles we might need more. \n\nIn 13 moves, we must have at least 9 U's, so at most 4 non-U moves. But non-U moves (S or D) don't help us go up. In fact, if we do D, we have to do an extra U later. \n\nSo the minimal H must be at least 9. But we have paths of 14. \n\nCan we do 13? \n\nSuppose we do 9 U's and 4 S's. Then we would be at row9 in 13 moves? \n\nBut we have to avoid the dangerous times.\n\nWe start at0. We need to get to9. We have 13 moves: 9U and 4S.\n\nThe timing matters.\n\nWe have to avoid:\n- row5,7,8 at t30\n- row1,2 at t31,32,33,40,41,42\n- row3,4 at t32,33\n\nBut note: we are going to be at row1 at some turn. We must avoid t31,32,33,40,41,42 for row1.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nWe want to be at row9 at turn41.\n\nWe can try to schedule the moves so that we are not on the dangerous rows at dangerous times.\n\nBut we have to cover rows 1 to 8.\n\nThe moves: we have 13 moves: 9U and 4S.\n\nWe start at turn28 at0.\n\nAfter the first move (at turn28) we are at turn29.\n\nWe need to be at9 at turn41.\n\nSo we have 12 moves from turn29 to turn40? Actually, we take actions at turn28 to turn40 (13 actions) and then at turn41 we are at9.\n\nThe positions at each turn (from turn28 to turn40) are 13 positions? But we start at turn28: y28=0.\n\nThen after 13 actions, we have y41=9.\n\nWe can represent the path as a sequence of 13 actions (from turn28 to turn40) of U, S, D (but D might be bad) such that the cumulative U's minus D's is 9, and we never are on a dangerous row at a dangerous time.\n\nBut note: we cannot go below 0 or above 9.\n\nGiven the dangerous times, we must avoid being on row1 at turns31,32,33,40,41,42 -> but we are at turn41 at row9? So we are not on row1 at turn41. Similarly, we are at row9 at turn41, which is safe.\n\nBut at turn40: we might be on row8? Then we go U to9 at41.\n\nAt turn40: we are on row8: dangerous? dangerous[8]={30} -> safe.\n\nSimilarly, row1 at turn40: dangerous? dangerous[1] has 40 -> so we cannot be on row1 at turn40.\n\nWe must schedule so that we are not on row1 at t31,32,33,40,41,42.\n\nBut turn41: we are at row9 -> not row1.\n\nSimilarly, turn42: we are done.\n\nSo we must avoid row1 at t31,32,33,40.\n\nNow, let me see the earliest we can be at row9: we must have 9 U's. The minimal number of moves is 9. But we have 13 moves, so we have 4 extra moves. We can use them to wait (stay) at safe rows.\n\nWe have to avoid the dangerous time windows.\n\nWe break the journey:\n\n- We must not be on row1 at t31,32,33,40 -> so we can be on row1 at t29,30,34,35,36,37,38,39,41? but we don't need to be on row1 after we pass it.\n\nSimilarly for row2: avoid t31,32,33,40,41,42 -> but at t41 we are at9, so we can be on row2 only up to t40? but we avoid t40.\n\nSo row2: avoid t31,32,33,40.\n\nRow3: avoid t32,33.\n\nRow4: same.\n\nRow5: avoid t30.\n\nRow7: avoid t30.\n\nRow8: avoid t30.\n\nWe can try to go as fast as possible but skip the dangerous times.\n\nFor example:\n\nt28: U -> t29:1 (safe, because 29 not dangerous for row1)\nt29: U -> t30:2 (safe, because 30 not dangerous for row2)\nt30: we cannot stay at2 because then at t31: row2 -> dangerous.\n   We cannot go down to1 at t31: dangerous.\n   So we must go up to3 at t31: safe (row3 at t31: not dangerous)\nt31: now at3. We cannot stay at3 because at t32: row3 -> dangerous.\n   We cannot go down to2 at t32: dangerous for row2.\n   So we must go up to4 at t32: but row4 at t32: dangerous -> collision.\n\nSo stuck.\n\nAlternatively, at t30: we do not go up? But we are at2 at t30. We can only do S or D? \n   S: stay at2 at t31: dangerous.\n   D: to1 at t31: dangerous.\n\nSo we must leave row2 at t30? But we can only go up to3? Then we are at3 at t31, which is safe, but then at t32 we are stuck.\n\nTherefore, we must avoid being at row2 at t30? \n\nThen we should not do two U's in the first two moves? \n\nTry:\n\nt28: U -> t29:1\nt29: S -> t30:1 -> then at t30: row1 -> safe? dangerous[1] at t30: not present -> safe.\nBut then at t30: we are at1. Then at t30: we can do U to2 at t31: row2 at t31: dangerous -> collision.\n   or S: stay at1 at t31: dangerous -> collision.\n   or D: to0 at t31: safe.\n\nThen from t31: at0 -> we have to go up again? \n\nThen:\nt31: U to1 at t32: row1 at t32: dangerous (32 in dangerous[1]) -> collision.\n\nt31: S: stay at0 -> then we are safe, but we waste a move.\n\nThen we can go up later.\n\nBut this might lead to a longer path.\n\nWe might need to wait at0 until after the dangerous times for the lower rows and then go up.\n\nBut we already have a path of 14 moves.\n\nGiven the complexity, and since we have a valid path of 14 moves, we output that.\n\nBut note: in the first BFS we found a path that took 14 moves: \n   actions: ['U','S','D','S','S','U','U','U','U','U','U','U','U','U'] \n\nBut wait, that's 14 actions: \n   The first 7: U, S, D, S, S, U, U -> gets to (35,2) at turn35? \n   Then 7 U's: so the entire sequence is 14 actions.\n\nBut let me write the actions per turn:\n\nTurn28: U\nTurn29: S\nTurn30: D\nTurn31: S\nTurn32: S\nTurn33: U\nTurn34: U\nTurn35: U\nTurn36: U\nTurn37: U\nTurn38: U\nTurn39: U\nTurn40: U\nTurn41: U\n\nThen at turn42: we are at9.\n\nNow, we must output the actions for turns 28 to 28+H-1 = 28 to 41.\n\nSo 14 actions.\n\nBut is there a path with 13 actions? \n\nSuppose we do 9 U's and 4 S's, and we try to avoid the dangerous times.\n\nWe must be at row1 at some turn not in {31,32,33,40}, similarly for others.\n\nWe can try to be at row1 at t29 and t34, for example.\n\nExample:\n\nt28: U -> t29:1 (safe)\nt29: S -> t30:1 (safe) \nt30: S -> t31:1 -> dangerous (31 in dangerous[1]) -> not allowed.\n\nt28: S -> t29:0\nt29: S -> t30:0\nt30: U -> t31:1 -> dangerous.\n\nt28: U -> t29:1\nt29: U -> t30:2 (safe)\nt30: U -> t31:3 (safe)\nt31: we must leave row3? because at t32: dangerous.\n   So we go U to4 at t32: but row4 at t32: dangerous -> collision.\n\nt28: U (t29:1)\nt29: U (t30:2)\nt30: D (t31:1) -> dangerous.\n\nSo I don't see a 13-move path.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 14.\n\nWe output the sequence we found: \n   ['U','S','D','S','S','U','U','U','U','U','U','U','U','U']\n\nBut note: we had an alternative path that stayed at0 for more moves and then went up: \n   actions: \n        t28: S\n        t29: S\n        t30: S\n        t31: S\n        t32: S\n        t33: U\n        t34: U\n        t35: U\n        t36: U\n        t37: U\n        t38: U\n        t39: U\n        t40: U\n        t41: U\n\nThis is also 14 moves.\n\nWhich one is better? Both are minimal.\n\nWe can choose either.\n\nBut the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and both have H=14.\n\nWe can output the one we found first.\n\nBut note: in the BFS we found the first path that went through (34,1) then (35,2) and then up.\n\nWe also have the path that stayed at0 until t33 and then went up.\n\nBut the problem does not specify which one to choose if multiple, so we can choose any.\n\nI'll output the first one we found: the one that went up then down then up.\n\nBut let me write it clearly.\n\nThe sequence:\n\nTurn 28: U\nTurn 29: S\nTurn 30: D\nTurn 31: S\nTurn 32: S\nTurn 33: U\nTurn 34: U\nTurn 35: U\nTurn 36: U\nTurn 37: U\nTurn 38: U\nTurn 39: U\nTurn 40: U\nTurn 41: U\n\nBut wait: we have 14 actions, but at turn41 we take the last U to go to9 at turn42.\n\nWe must list actions for turns 28 to 41.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 28: U\nTurn 29: S\nTurn 30: D\nTurn 31: S\nTurn 32: S\nTurn 33: U\nTurn 34: U\nTurn 35: U\nTurn 36: U\nTurn 37: U\nTurn 38: U\nTurn 39: U\nTurn 40: U\nTurn 41: U\n\nBut let me check the position at turn41: \n   We start at0 at28.\n   After U at28: at29:1\n   S at29: at30:1\n   D at30: at31:0\n   S at31: at32:0\n   S at32: at33:0\n   U at33: at34:1\n   U at34: at35:2\n   U at35: at36:3\n   U at36: at37:4\n   U at37: at38:5\n   U at38: at39:6\n   U at39: at40:7\n   U at40: at41:8\n   U at41: at42:9\n\nAnd we checked that we avoid collisions.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 28: U\nTurn 29: S\nTurn 30: D\nTurn 31: S\nTurn 32: S\nTurn 33: U\nTurn 34: U\nTurn 35: U\nTurn 36: U\nTurn 37: U\nTurn 38: U\nTurn 39: U\nTurn 40: U\nTurn 41: U\n}\n\nNote: The last action at turn41 leads to y=9 at turn42.\n\nTotal turns: 14 actions.\n</think>\nTo reach the position (0, 9) from (0, 0) at turn 28 while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8, the minimal number of turns required is 14. The sequence of actions ensures the player avoids all dangerous times when cars occupy position 0 on the respective freeways. The dangerous times for each freeway, derived from the car movement rules and initial states, are:\n\n- Freeway 1: Turns 31, 32, 33, 40, 41, 42\n- Freeway 2: Turns 31, 32, 33, 40, 41, 42\n- Freeway 3: Turns 32, 33\n- Freeway 4: Turns 32, 33\n- Freeway 5: Turn 30\n- Freeway 6: No dangerous times\n- Freeway 7: Turn 30\n- Freeway 8: Turn 30\n\nThe action sequence is designed to:\n- Move up to row 1 at turn 29 (safe, as turn 29 is not dangerous for row 1).\n- Stay at row 1 at turn 30 (safe, as turn 30 is not dangerous for row 1).\n- Move down to row 0 at turn 31 (safe, as row 0 is not a freeway).\n- Stay at row 0 at turns 31, 32, and 33 to avoid dangerous times on rows 1-8.\n- Move up to row 1 at turn 34 (safe, as turn 34 is not dangerous for row 1).\n- Move up to row 2 at turn 35 (safe, as turn 35 is not dangerous for row 2).\n- Move up consecutively to rows 3 through 8 from turns 36 to 41 (all safe, as the dangerous times for these rows have passed or do not exist).\n- Reach row 9 at turn 42 after the final action at turn 41.\n\nThe sequence of actions is as follows:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 28: U\nTurn 29: S\nTurn 30: D\nTurn 31: S\nTurn 32: S\nTurn 33: U\nTurn 34: U\nTurn 35: U\nTurn 36: U\nTurn 37: U\nTurn 38: U\nTurn 39: U\nTurn 40: U\nTurn 41: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,1) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The player moves vertically with actions U (up), D (down), or S (stay), changing y by +1, -1, or 0, and y must stay between 0 and 9. Cars move horizontally on their freeways, and I collide only if I'm on a freeway y at turn T and for some car on that freeway, 0 is in its span at that turn.\n\nThe key point is that when I move to a new y, I'm not on that new y until the next turn. So if I move up from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T I'm still on y, and at turn T+1 I'm on y+1. Similarly for down or stay.\n\nThe collision condition: at turn T, I'm on y_T, and I collide if for any car on freeway y_T, 0 is in [head - s*(T-t1), tail - s*(T-t1)] for left-moving, or [tail + s*(T-t1), head + s*(T-t1)] for right-moving. Since all cars here are right-moving, I think, based on the data.\n\nLooking at the car states, all directions are \"right\", so all cars are moving right. So for right-moving cars, at time T, span is [τ + s*(T - t1), h + s*(T - t1)], and since they're moving right, head is to the right, so in the span it's [tail, head] or something? Let me read carefully.\n\nIn the car update: for right-moving, it says: Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nAnd since it's right-moving, I think h is the head (right end), τ is tail (left end), so at T, the span is [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)], so it's moving to the right.\n\nCollision if 0 is in [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)] for some car on freeway y at turn T when I'm on that freeway.\n\nt1 is given as 30, current turn.\n\nPlayer starts at (0,1) at turn t1=30.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, I think, since no freeways there, only y=1 to 8 have cars.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are the edges, probably no cars, so safe.\n\nBut I start at y=1, which has cars, but at turn t1, I might or might not be colliding, but I need to avoid collisions at each turn I'm on a freeway.\n\nFirst, let's list all the cars for each freeway at time t1=30.\n\nFreeway k=1: cars: (-40,-51,right,4), (-4,-15,right,4), (32,21,right,4)\n\nThe format is (head, tail, direction, speed). But for right-moving, head should be greater than tail, I assume.\n\nLook: first car: head=-40, tail=-51? -40 > -51, so head=-40, tail=-51, that means the car is from x=-51 to x=-40, so head at -40, tail at -51? But usually head is the front, so for right-moving, front should be at higher x.\n\n-40 > -51, so if moving right, head at -40, tail at -51, so the car spans from x=-51 to x=-40.\n\nAt t1=30, position.\n\nSimilarly, second car: head=-4, tail=-15, so from -15 to -4? [tail, head] = [-15, -4]? But in the span, it's given as (head, tail), so ( -4, -15 ) means head=-4, tail=-15, so for right-moving, the span is from tail to head, so min to max.\n\nI think it's better to think of the position at t1.\n\nFor a car, at t1, the span is given as (head, tail), so for right-moving, the left end is min(head,tail)? No.\n\nIn the update, for right-moving, Span(t1) = [τ, h], so τ is tail, h is head, so [tail, head], with tail < head for right-moving.\n\nIn the first car: (head=-40, tail=-51), so head=-40, tail=-51, but -40 > -51, so tail=-51, head=-40, so [tail, head] = [-51, -40], so left end -51, right end -40.\n\nSimilarly, second car: head=-4, tail=-15, tail=-15, head=-4, so [-15, -4].\n\nThird car: head=32, tail=21, but 32>21, so tail=21, head=32, so [21,32].\n\nBut head=32, tail=21, so [21,32].\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nIn the list, for k=1: (-40,-51,right,4) so head=-40, tail=-51, span at t1: [-51,-40]\n\n(-4,-15,right,4) head=-4, tail=-15, span [-15,-4]\n\n(32,21,right,4) head=32, tail=21, but tail should be left, head right, so if head=32, tail=21, 32>21, so [21,32], yes.\n\nBut in the pair, it's (head, tail), so for (32,21), head=32, tail=21.\n\nSimilarly, for k=2, same as k=1? Let's see.\n\nk=2: (-40,-51,right,4), (-4,-15,right,4), (32,21,right,4) same as k=1.\n\nk=3: (60,49,right,6), (24,13,right,6), (-12,-23,right,6)\n\nFor (60,49): head=60, tail=49, so [49,60]\n\n(24,13): head=24, tail=13, [13,24]\n\n(-12,-23): head=-12, tail=-23, so [-23,-12]\n\nk=4 same as k=3.\n\nk=5: (-48,-59,right,12), (36,25,right,12), (0,-11,right,12)\n\n(-48,-59): head=-48, tail=-59, [-59,-48]\n\n(36,25): head=36, tail=25, [25,36]\n\n(0,-11): head=0, tail=-11, [-11,0]\n\nAt t1=30, this car has head=0, tail=-11, so span [-11,0], so at x=0, it is included, since 0 is in [-11,0].\n\nBut I am at y=1 at turn t1=30, and freeway y=1 has cars, but this is for k=5, y=5? Freeway k is y=k, I assume.\n\nFreeway k means y=k, I think.\n\nIn the table, \"Freeway k\" and y=1 to 8, so k from 1 to 8, y=k.\n\nSo for y=5 at t1=30, there is a car with span [-11,0], so at x=0, it is occupied, and since I am at (0,1) at turn 30, which is on freeway y=1, not y=5, so for y=1, let's see if there is collision.\n\nFirst, for me at turn t1=30, position y=1.\n\nFreeway y=1: cars with spans at t1:\n\nFirst car: [-51,-40], since s=4, right-moving.\n\nSecond: [-15,-4]\n\nThird: [21,32]\n\n0 is not in any of these: -51 to -40, -15 to -4, 21 to 32, all away from 0, so at turn 30, on y=1, no collision.\n\nSimilarly, for other freeways, but I'm only concerned when I'm on them.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=1 to y=9.\n\ny=9 is safe, no cars.\n\nThe minimal path might be to go straight up, but I have to avoid cars on y=2 to y=8 when I'm there.\n\nSince I can move up, down, or stay, I might need to wait or move down to avoid, but since I need to go to 9, down might not help, but I can stay to time my move.\n\nThe cars are moving, so the spans change over time.\n\nI need to find a sequence of actions from turn 30 onwards.\n\nEach turn, after action, y changes, and I might be on a different y, and need to check collision at that turn for the y I'm on.\n\nLet t be the turn number, starting from t=30.\n\nAt turn t, I am at y_t, and I choose action a_t, which determines y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, with Δy based on a_t.\n\nThen at turn t, I am on y_t, and I collide if for some car on freeway y_t, 0 is in the car's span at time t.\n\nThe car's span at time t is based on t1=30.\n\nSo for a car, at time t, span is [τ + s*(t - 30), h + s*(t - 30)] for right-moving, since all are right-moving.\n\nτ and h are at t1=30.\n\nIn the notation, τ and h are given at t1.\n\nSo for a car, let left_t = τ + s*(t - 30)\n\nright_t = h + s*(t - 30)\n\nThen span at t is [left_t, right_t]\n\nCollision if 0 in [left_t, right_t] for some car on that freeway.\n\nAnd this is checked at each turn t when I am on y_t.\n\nI start at t=30, y=1, no collision as above.\n\nI need to reach y=9 at some turn, say T, so at turn T, y_T=9, and since y=9 has no cars, no collision, and I need to be at (0,9), which is fine.\n\nThe position is (0,y), so x=0 always, only y changes.\n\nNow, to minimize the number of turns, H, from t=30 to t=30+H-1, so after H actions, I am at y_{30+H-1} =9? Let's see the turn indexing.\n\nThe sequence is from t=30 to t=30 + H -1, so actions at t=30, 31, ..., 30+H-1.\n\nAfter action at t, y_{t+1} is set.\n\nAt turn 30, I am at y=1.\n\nAfter action a_{30}, y_{31} = y_{30} + Δy_{30}\n\nSimilarly, after a_{31}, y_{32} = y_{31} + Δy_{31}, and so on.\n\nI reach y=9 at some turn T, meaning at turn T, I am at y_T=9.\n\nSince y=9 is safe for any T.\n\nThe last action that got me to y=9 is at turn T-1, which set y_T = y_{T-1} + Δy_{T-1} =9.\n\nThen, the turns from 30 to T, I need to not collide.\n\nThe number of actions is from t=30 to t=T-1, so H actions, and after H actions, I am at y_{30+H} =9.\n\nSet t=30 as time 0 for simplicity.\n\nLet τ = t - 30, so at τ=0, turn 30, y=1.\n\nAt time τ, y_τ.\n\nAction at time τ determines y_{τ+1}.\n\nI need y_H =9 for some H, and for each τ from 0 to H-1, at time τ, I am on y_τ, no collision.\n\nAt time τ, y_τ is my position, and I need no collision at that time.\n\nThen after action at τ, y_{τ+1} is set, and at time τ+1, I am on y_{τ+1}, and so on.\n\nI reach y_H =9 at time H.\n\nH is the number of turns from start, including start.\n\nAt τ=0, time 0, y=1.\n\nAfter action at τ=0, y_1 = y_0 + Δy_0\n\n...\n\nAfter action at τ=k, y_{k+1} = y_k + Δy_k\n\nAt time τ, I am on y_τ.\n\nI want at some time τ=H, y_H=9.\n\nFor each τ from 0 to H, at time τ, I am on y_τ, and no collision, except that at τ=H, y_H=9, no cars, so safe.\n\nThe actions are from τ=0 to τ=H-1, H actions.\n\nMinimal H such that I can reach y_H=9 with no collision for τ=0 to H-1? τ from 0 to H, positions at times 0 to H.\n\nAt time τ=0 to H, I have positions y_0 to y_H.\n\nFor each time τ, collision check at that time.\n\ny_0=1, y_H=9.\n\nThe path is y_0, y_1, ..., y_H with y_{k+1} = y_k + a_k, where a_k is action at time k, Δy = +1,0,-1.\n\nAnd for each k from 0 to H, at time k, on y_k, no collision with cars on freeway y_k at that time.\n\nH is to be minimized.\n\nSince y changes by at most 1, the minimal H is at least the distance, |9-1| =8, so at least 8 moves up, but I might need to stay or move down to avoid, so H could be more.\n\nBut I want minimal H, so I should go up as fast as possible, unless blocked.\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need to see when x=0 is occupied by a car.\n\nFor each freeway y, and for each car on it, I can find the times when 0 is in the span.\n\nThen, for a given y and time τ, collision if for some car on y, 0 in span at τ.\n\nOtherwise, safe to be on y at τ.\n\nFirst, let's compute for each freeway the times when x=0 is occupied.\n\nSince the cars are moving, the span changes.\n\nLet τ = t - 30, so time offset from now.\n\nFor a car with tail, head, s at τ=0.\n\nThen at time τ, left_τ = tail + s * τ  (since right-moving, and tail is left end)\n\nFrom above, for right-moving, span at τ: [τ + s*τ, h + s*τ] where τ is tail, h is head at τ=0.\n\nSet L0 = tail at τ=0\n\nR0 = head at τ=0\n\nThen at time τ, L_τ = L0 + s * τ\n\nR_τ = R0 + s * τ\n\nSpan [L_τ, R_τ]\n\n0 in span if L_τ <= 0 <= R_τ\n\nSince L_τ <= R_τ always.\n\nSo 0 occupied if min(L_τ, R_τ) <= 0 <= max(L_τ, R_τ), but since L_τ <= R_τ, it's L_τ <= 0 <= R_τ.\n\nNow, for each freeway, list the cars and their parameters.\n\nFreeway y=1:\n\nCar1: L0 = -51, R0 = -40, s=4\n\nCar2: L0 = -15, R0 = -4, s=4\n\nCar3: L0 = 21, R0 = 32, s=4  (since tail=21, head=32)\n\nFor car3: at τ=0, (head=32,tail=21), so R0=32, L0=21.\n\nSimilarly, all s=4.\n\nNow, for car1: L_τ = -51 + 4τ\n\nR_τ = -40 + 4τ\n\n0 in span if -51 +4τ <= 0 <= -40 +4τ\n\nWhich is 4τ <= 51 and 4τ >=40, so τ >= 10 and τ <= 12.75, since 4*10=40, 4*12=48, 4*13=52>51?

No, y=5 unsafe τ=0 and τ=4.\n\nAt τ=3, not τ=0 or τ=4, so y=5 safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=6 safe, etc.\n\nBut from y(1)=0, at τ=1, if I stay at τ=1, y(2)=0.\n\nThen at τ=2, y=0, safe.\n\nThen action at τ=2: I can go to y(3)=1 (U) or stay.\n\nBut at τ=3, y=1 unsafe, so if I go to y=1 at τ=3, collide.\n\nIf stay, y(3)=0.\n\nThen at τ=3, y=0 safe.\n\nNow τ=4, y=1 unsafe? y=1 unsafe at τ=10,11,12, not at τ=4.\n\ny=1 unsafe at τ=1,2,3,10,11,12.\n\nAt τ=4, not in, so safe.\n\nSimilarly y=2 same.\n\nAt τ=4, safe y: all except possibly some.\n\ny=1: unsafe τ=1,2,3,10,11,12, so τ=4 safe\n\ny=2: same, safe\n\ny=3: unsafe τ=2,3, so τ=4 safe\n\ny=4: same, safe\n\ny=5: unsafe at τ=4, so unsafe at τ=4\n\ny=6: safe\n\ny=7: unsafe τ=0, so safe\n\netc.\n\nSo at τ=4, y=5 unsafe, others safe.\n\nFrom above, at τ=3, y(3)=0 if I stayed.\n\nThen at τ=3, I can go up to y(4)=1.\n\nAt τ=4, y=1 is safe, as above.\n\ny(4)=1, at time τ=4, y=1 safe.\n\nThen I can continue up.\n\nBut let's see the path so far.\n\nAt τ=0: y=1, action D, go down to y=0\n\nAfter action D at τ=0, y(1) = 0\n\nAt τ=1: y=0, action? I need to choose.\n\nAt τ=1, y=0, I can choose to stay or go up.\n\nBut at τ=2, if I go up to y=1, unsafe, so I must stay at τ=1.\n\nAction S at τ=1, so y(2) = y(1) +0 =0\n\nAt τ=2: y=0, action? Now at τ=2, y=0 safe.\n\nI can go up to y(3)=1.\n\nAt τ=3, y=1: but y=1 unsafe at τ=3? τ=3 is in 1,2,3, so unsafe.\n\nCannot go to y=1 at τ=3.\n\nIf I stay, y(3)=0.\n\nAt τ=3, y=0 safe.\n\nThen at τ=3, action: if I go up to y(4)=1.\n\nAt τ=4, y=1: τ=4 not in unsafe times, so safe.\n\nYes.\n\nSo actions:\n\nτ=0 (turn 30): action D, to y=0\n\nτ=1 (turn 31): action S, stay y=0\n\nτ=2 (turn 32): action S, stay y=0? At τ=2, y=0, I could go up to y=1 at τ=3, but τ=3 y=1 unsafe, so I should stay.\n\nThen τ=3 (turn 33): action U, to y=1\n\nAt τ=4, y=1, which is safe.\n\ny(4)=1 at τ=4.\n\nNow from here, I can go up to y=9.\n\nBut y=1 is safe at τ=4, but I need to go to y=2, etc.\n\nAt τ=4, y=1 safe.\n\nAction U at τ=4: y(5) =2\n\nAt τ=5, y=2.\n\ny=2 at τ=5: unsafe times for y=2 are τ=1,2,3,10,11,12, so τ=5 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly, I can continue up.\n\nBut y=5 has unsafe at τ=4, but at τ=5, y=5 should be safe.\n\ny=5 unsafe only at τ=0 and τ=4.\n\nAt τ=5, safe.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nSo let's go step by step.\n\nFrom τ=4, y=1\n\nAction U: y(5)=2\n\nAt τ=5, y=2 safe (since τ=5 not 1,2,3,10,11,12)\n\nAction U: y(6)=3\n\nAt τ=6, y=3: unsafe times τ=2,3, so τ=6 safe.\n\nAction U: y(7)=4\n\nAt τ=7, y=4: unsafe τ=2,3, so τ=7 safe.\n\nAction U: y(8)=5\n\nAt τ=8, y=5: unsafe τ=0,4, so τ=8 not 0 or 4, safe.\n\nAction U: y(9)=6\n\nAt τ=9, y=6: always safe.\n\nAction U: y(10)=7\n\nAt τ=10, y=7: unsafe times? y=7 unsafe only at τ=0, so τ=10 safe.\n\nAction U: y(11)=8\n\nAt τ=11, y=8: unsafe only at τ=0, so safe.\n\nAction U: y(12)=9\n\nAt τ=12, y=9, safe.\n\nNow, I reached y=9 at τ=12.\n\nH=12, from τ=0 to τ=12, 12 steps.\n\nBut is this minimal?\n\nI started at τ=0, y=1.\n\nAfter 12 actions, at τ=12, y=9.\n\nNumber of turns: from τ=0 to τ=12, 13 positions, but H is the number of actions to reach.\n\nAt time τ=0, after 0 actions, y=1.\n\nAfter 1 action, y=1 (if S) or etc.\n\nAfter H actions, y_H =9.\n\nIn this case, after 12 actions, y_{12}=9.\n\nActions from τ=0 to τ=11.\n\nList the actions:\n\nAt time τ, action a_τ, sets y_{τ+1}.\n\nAt τ=0: action D, set y(1)=0\n\nτ=1: action S, set y(2)=0\n\nτ=2: action S, set y(3)=0? Earlier I said at τ=2, stay or what.\n\nIn the path:\n\nAt τ=0: y=1, action D, y(1)=0\n\nτ=1: y=0, action S, y(2)=0\n\nτ=2: y=0, now action: if I go U, y(3)=1, but at τ=3, y=1 unsafe.\n\nSo I need to stay or something else.\n\nAt τ=2, y=0, I can only go to y=1 or stay.\n\nIf stay, y(3)=0\n\nThen τ=3: y=0, action U, y(4)=1\n\nAt τ=4, y=1 safe.\n\nThen τ=4: y=1, action U, y(5)=2\n\nτ=5: y=2, action U, y(6)=3\n\nτ=6: y=3, action U, y(7)=4\n\nτ=7: y=4, action U, y(8)=5\n\nτ=8: y=5, action U, y(9)=6\n\nτ=9: y=6, action U, y(10)=7\n\nτ=10: y=7, action U, y(11)=8\n\nτ=11: y=8, action U, y(12)=9\n\nAt τ=12, y=9.\n\nActions at τ=0 to τ=11, 12 actions.\n\nH=12.\n\nBut can I do better?\n\nFor example, at the beginning, instead of going down, can I go directly to a safe y.\n\nAt τ=0, y=1 safe.\n\nBut at τ=1, y=1 and y=2 unsafe, and from y=1, I can only go to y=0,1,2.\n\ny=0 safe at τ=1, but y=1 and y=2 unsafe.\n\nSo I must go to y=0 at τ=1, by action D at τ=0.\n\nThen at τ=1, y=0.\n\nNow, at τ=1, I need to go to a safe y at τ=2.\n\nAt τ=2, as before, y=1,2,3,4 unsafe.\n\nSafe y: 0,5,6,7,8,9\n\nFrom y=0, I can go to y=1 or stay.\n\nBut y=1 unsafe at τ=2, so I can only stay at y=0 or go to y=1, but y=1 unsafe, so must stay, action S, y(2)=0.\n\nThen at τ=2, y=0.\n\nNow at τ=2, I need to go to safe y at τ=3.\n\nAt τ=3, y=1,2,3,4 unsafe.\n\nSafe y: 0,5,6,7,8,9\n\nFrom y=0, same, can only go to y=1 or stay.\n\ny=1 unsafe at τ=3, so must stay, action S, y(3)=0.\n\nThen at τ=3, y=0.\n\nNow at τ=3, action: go to y(4)=1 (U)\n\nAt τ=4, y=1 safe, as before.\n\nSame as before.\n\nAt τ=1, y=0, I cannot jump to y=5 or something, since I can only move to adjacent y.\n\nSo I think I have to stay at y=0 until τ=3, then go up.\n\nBut at τ=4, I go to y=1.\n\nPerhaps I can go directly to a higher y later.\n\nBut from above, from τ=4 to τ=12, it takes 8 steps to go from y=1 to y=9, which is 8 moves up, minimal, since I need 8 increases.\n\nIn the path, from τ=4 y=1 to τ=12 y=9, with 8 up moves, no stay, so that part is minimal.\n\nThe delay is from τ=0 to τ=4, where I spent 4 turns to be at y=1 at τ=4, but I started at y=1 at τ=0, but couldn't stay or move up immediately.\n\nAt τ=0, y=1, but at τ=1, if I could be on a safe y, but I can only be on y=0,1,2, and 1 and 2 unsafe, so only y=0.\n\nThen similarly.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=6 directly, but I have to move step by step.\n\nAnother idea: since y=6 is always safe, I could go to y=6 as fast as possible.\n\nFrom y=1 at τ=0.\n\nTo go to y=6, I need 5 moves up.\n\nBut I need to avoid unsafe times on intermediate y.\n\nFor example, at τ=1, if I were on y=2, unsafe, but I cannot be on y=2 at τ=1.\n\nThe earliest I can be on y=6 is if I go up every turn starting from when possible.\n\nBut at τ=0, I go down to y=0, as before.\n\nThen I stay until τ=3, then go up.\n\nAt τ=3, y=0, action U, to y=1 at τ=4.\n\nThen from τ=4, I can go up to y=6 quickly.\n\ny(4)=1\n\nτ=4: U, y(5)=2\n\nτ=5: U, y(6)=3\n\nτ=6: U, y(7)=4\n\nτ=7: U, y(8)=5\n\nτ=8: U, y(9)=6\n\nAt τ=9, y=6.\n\nBut in my earlier path, I had y(9)=6 at τ=9.\n\nThen to y=9, need 3 more up.\n\nBut in the path to y=9, I continued.\n\nIn the first path, I reached y=9 at τ=12.\n\nFrom y=6 at τ=9, I can go to y=7 at τ=10, etc.\n\nBut at τ=10, when I go to y=7, but y=7 is safe at τ=10, as before.\n\nBut y=1 and y=2 are unsafe at τ=10,11,12, but I am not on them.\n\nIn my path, I was on y=7 at τ=10, safe.\n\nBut can I save time?\n\nFor example, at τ=4, when I am at y=1, instead of going up slowly, but I have to.\n\nAnother point: at τ=4, y=1, but I could go to y=5 or something faster, but no, step by step.\n\nPerhaps I don't need to go all the way down.\n\nAt τ=0, y=1.\n\nAction at τ=0: if I stay, y(1)=1, but at τ=1, y=1 unsafe, collision.\n\nIf I go up, y(1)=2, at τ=1, y=2 unsafe, collision.\n\nOnly down to y=0.\n\nThen at τ=1, y=0.\n\nNow, instead of staying, I have to stay because going up is unsafe.\n\nUnless I can be on a safe y at τ=2.\n\nBut from y=0, I can only be on y=0 or y=1 at τ=2.\n\ny=0 safe, y=1 unsafe.\n\nSo must be on y=0 at τ=2.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut at τ=2, I am on y=0.\n\nNow, at τ=2, if I go up to y=1 at τ=3, but τ=3 y=1 unsafe.\n\nSo must stay.\n\nThen at τ=3, go up to y=1 at τ=4, safe.\n\nSo I think it's necessary.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=5 directly from y=0, but no, I can only move to adjacent.\n\nAnother idea: since at τ=1, from y=0, I can only do S or U, both lead to unsafe or stay.\n\nBut at τ=1, if I stay, y(2)=0.\n\nThen at τ=2, y=0, I can stay or go U to y=1 at τ=3 unsafe.\n\nBut at τ=2, is there a way to be on y=5? No.\n\ny=5 is safe at τ=2, but I am at y=0, I can't reach it in one step.\n\nSo impossible.\n\nThus, the path I have seems necessary for the beginning.\n\nThen from y=1 at τ=4 to y=9 at τ=12 with 8 up moves, no stays, so minimal for that segment.\n\nTotal H=12 actions.\n\nBut let's confirm if I can reach earlier.\n\nSuppose I go to y=6 faster.\n\nBut from τ=0 to τ=3, I am at y=0, then at τ=4 y=1.\n\nI need to reach y=6.\n\ny=6 can be reached at τ=5? Let's see.\n\nAt τ=4, y=1.\n\nIf I go up to y=2 at τ=5.\n\nAt τ=5, y=2 safe, as before.\n\nThen to y=3 at τ=6, safe.\n\ny=4 at τ=7, safe.\n\ny=5 at τ=8, safe.\n\ny=6 at τ=9, same as before.\n\nNo faster.\n\nFrom y=1 at τ=4, I go up each turn, y=2 at τ=5, y=3 at τ=6, etc.\n\nBut at τ=10, when I am on y=7, safe, but if I could be on y=9 earlier, but I need to go through.\n\ny=9 can be reached at τ=7? But at τ=7, I am at y=4 in the path, not higher.\n\nMinimal time to reach y=9 from y=1 is 8 steps, but I started from y=1 at τ=4, so at τ=12.\n\nBut at τ=0, I was at y=1, but I had to move away.\n\nPerhaps I can go to a different y.\n\nAnother thought: at τ=0, y=1, I go down to y=0.\n\nThen at τ=1, y=0, instead of staying, I must stay.\n\nBut suppose at τ=1, I stay, y(2)=0.\n\nThen at τ=2, I stay, y(3)=0.\n\nThen at τ=3, I go up to y=1 at τ=4.\n\nBut at τ=3, I could go directly to y=2 or something, but from y=0, only to y=1.\n\nNo.\n\nPerhaps I can be on y=5 at some point when it is safe.\n\nFor example, y=5 is unsafe only at τ=0 and τ=4.\n\nAt τ=0, unsafe, but I am not on it.\n\nAt τ=4, unsafe.\n\nBut at other times safe.\n\nIn my path, I am on y=5 at τ=8, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut to save time, suppose I can be on y=3 at τ=1.\n\nAt τ=1, y=3 is safe, as we said earlier.\n\nBut how can I be on y=3 at τ=1?\n\nAt τ=0, I am at y=1.\n\nTo be at y=3 at τ=1, I need to move up twice in one turn, impossible, since I can only change by 1 per turn.\n\nSo I cannot jump.\n\nThus, I think H=12 is minimal.\n\nBut let's see if I can avoid going down.\n\nFor example, at τ=0, y=1, I must leave because at τ=1, both y=1 and y=2 unsafe, and I can only be on them or y=0.\n\nSo no choice.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=0 and then to another y, but same.\n\nAnother idea: at τ=0, go down to y=0.\n\nThen at τ=1, y=0, I can stay or go up, but going up to y=1 at τ=2 unsafe, so stay.\n\nτ=2, same.\n\nτ=3, go up to y=1 at τ=4.\n\nBut at τ=4, y=1 safe.\n\nNow, from here, I need to go to y=9.\n\nBut at later times, y=1 and y=2 are unsafe again at τ=10,11,12.\n\nIn my path, I am on y=2 at τ=5, which is before τ=10, so safe.\n\ny=3 at τ=6, safe, etc.\n\nBut if I delay, I might hit the unsafe times.\n\nFor example, suppose I stay at y=1 longer, but at τ=1,2,3 it is unsafe, so I cannot.\n\nIn this case, from τ=4 to τ=12, I am moving up, not staying.\n\nPerhaps I can go faster to y=6 and stay, but no need.\n\nI think 12 is minimal.\n\nBut let's list the actions for the sequence.\n\nTurn t1=30: action D (down)\n\nThen at turn 31 (τ=1): action S (stay)\n\nIn terms of turns.\n\nt1=30, τ=0.\n\nAction at turn t: for turn t, action a_t.\n\nAt turn 30, action a_{30}, which determines y_{31}.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t=30 to t=30+H-1.\n\nIn my case, actions at t=30 to t=41? Let's see.\n\nτ=0, turn 30, action a_{30}, set y_{31}\n\nAfter a_{30}, y_{31} = y_{30} + Δy\n\nAt time τ=0, turn 30, y=1.\n\nAfter a_{30}, y_{31} set.\n\nThen at turn 31, time τ=1, I am on y_{31}, and so on.\n\nIn my path:\n\nAt turn 30 (τ=0): action D, so Δy = -1, so y_{31} = y_{30} + (-1) =1-1=0\n\nThen at turn 31 (τ=1): position y=0, action S, so y_{32} = y_{31} + 0 =0\n\nAt turn 32 (τ=2): position y=0, action S, so y_{33} =0\n\nAt turn 33 (τ=3): position y=0, action U, so y_{34} =0 +1=1\n\nAt turn 34 (τ=4): position y=1, action U, so y_{35} =1+1=2\n\nAt turn 35 (τ=5): position y=2, action U, so y_{36} =2+1=3\n\nAt turn 36 (τ=6): position y=3, action U, so y_{37} =3+1=4\n\nAt turn 37 (τ=7): position y=4, action U, so y_{38} =4+1=5\n\nAt turn 38 (τ=8): position y=5, action U, so y_{39} =5+1=6\n\nAt turn 39 (τ=9): position y=6, action U, so y_{40} =6+1=7\n\nAt turn 40 (τ=10): position y=7, action U, so y_{41} =7+1=8\n\nAt turn 41 (τ=11): position y=8, action U, so y_{42} =8+1=9\n\nNow at turn 42, position y=9, reached.\n\nActions from turn 30 to 41, that is 12 actions: t=30 to t=41.\n\nH=12.\n\nAnd y_{42} =9 at turn 42.\n\nNow, collision check:\n\nAt turn 30 (τ=0): y=1, safe as before.\n\nTurn 31 (τ=1): y=0, safe.\n\nTurn 32 (τ=2): y=0, safe.\n\nTurn 33 (τ=3): y=0, safe.\n\nTurn 34 (τ=4): y=1, not in unsafe times (τ=1,2,3,10,11,12, τ=4 not), safe.\n\nTurn 35 (τ=5): y=2, unsafe at τ=1,2,3,10,11,12, τ=5 not, safe.\n\nTurn 36 (τ=6): y=3, unsafe at τ=2,3, τ=6 not, safe.\n\nTurn 37 (τ=7): y=4, unsafe at τ=2,3, τ=7 not, safe.\n\nTurn 38 (τ=8): y=5, unsafe at τ=0,4, τ=8 not, safe.\n\nTurn 39 (τ=9): y=6, always safe.\n\nTurn 40 (τ=10): y=7, unsafe only at τ=0, τ=10 not, safe.\n\nTurn 41 (τ=11): y=8, unsafe only at τ=0, τ=11 not, safe.\n\nAt turn 42 (τ=12): y=9, safe.\n\nAll safe.\n\nNow, is there a shorter path?\n\nFor example, can I reach by turn 40 or something.\n\nSuppose I start at turn 30, y=1.\n\nIf I could be at y=2 at τ=0, but I am at y=1.\n\nAt τ=0, y=1 safe, but next turn issue.\n\nSuppose I go to y=0 at τ=1.\n\nThen at τ=1, y=0.\n\nIf I could go to y=3 at τ=2, but from y=0, I can only go to y=1 at τ=2, but y=1 unsafe at τ=2.\n\nCannot.\n\nPerhaps stay less time at y=0.\n\nBut I have to stay until τ=3 to go up at τ=4.\n\nAnother point: at τ=4, when I go to y=1, but y=1 is safe until τ=10, so I can go up immediately.\n\nBut in the up part, I have no delay.\n\nPerhaps I can skip some y when going up, but no, must move step by step.\n\nFor example, from y=1 to y=3 in one step, impossible.\n\nSo I think H=12 is minimal.\n\nBut let's see the answer format.\n\nThe sequence is for actions from turn 30 to 41.\n\nIn the box, it should be actions for each turn.\n\nAlso, for turn t_1 + H -1, but in the sequence, actions from t=30 to t=41.\n\nt_1=30, actions from t=30 to t=30+H-1.\n\nAfter H actions, I am at y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nSet t_1=30.\n\nAfter 0 actions, at turn 30, y=1.\n\nAfter 1 action (at t=30), at turn 31, y= something.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn 30+H, y=9.\n\nIn this case, after 12 actions, at turn 42, y=9.\n\nSo H=12.\n\nActions at turns: 30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41.\n\nNow, the actions:\n\nTurn 30: D\n\nTurn 31: S\n\nTurn 32: S\n\nTurn 33: U\n\nTurn 34: U\n\nTurn 35: U\n\nTurn 36: U\n\nTurn 37: U\n\nTurn 38: U\n\nTurn 39: U\n\nTurn 40: U\n\nTurn 41: U\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 33: action U, to y=1 at turn 34.\n\nBut at turn 34, position y=1, then action U to y=2 at turn 35, etc.\n\nIn the action list, it's the actions taken at each turn.\n\nIn the answer, it should be like:\n\nTurn 30: D\n\nTurn 31: S\n\nTurn 32: S\n\nTurn 33: U\n\nTurn 34: U\n\n...\n\nUp to Turn 41: U\n\nBut at turn 41, action U, to y=9 at turn 42.\n\nNow, for the box.\n\nBut in the sequence, from turn 34 to 41, all U except the first few.\n\nBut in the beginning, I have D, S, S.\n\nPerhaps I can avoid one stay.\n\nFor example, at turn 32, instead of stay, but I have to stay.\n\nNotice that at τ=4, I am at y=1, same as start, but 4 turns later.\n\nBut I had to move away.\n\nSince y=6 is safe, and I can be there earlier if possible, but from start, I need at least 5 steps to y=6, but I cannot start immediately.\n\nEarliest to be at y=6: at τ=0, y=1, cannot.\n\nAt τ=1, if I were at y=6, impossible.\n\nMinimal time to y=6: from y=1, 5 up moves, but I need to start from safe position.\n\nIn this case, at τ=4, y=1, then to y=6 at τ=9, as before.\n\nThen to y=9 at τ=12.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nSo the minimal H is 12.\n\nNow, to write the answer.\n\nBut in the car state, for y=6, there is a car, but it never reaches x=0, so safe.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nTurn 30: D\n\nTurn 31: S\n\nTurn 32: S\n\nTurn 33: U\n\nTurn 34: U\n\nTurn 35: U\n\nTurn 36: U\n\nTurn 37: U\n\nTurn 38: U\n\nTurn 39: U\n\nTurn 40: U\n\nTurn 41: U\n\nIn the actions, from turn 34 to 41, all U, that's 8 actions, and before that D,S,S,U? Turn 33 U to go to y=1 at turn 34.\n\nTurn 33: action U, from y=0 to y=1 at turn 34.\n\nThen turn 34: action U, to y=2 at turn 35, etc.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, for the box.\n\nBut let's confirm the turn numbers.\n\nt from 30 to 41 inclusive, 12 turns.\n\nAnswer format:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 30: D \\\\ \\text{Turn } 31: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 32: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 33: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 34: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 35: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 36: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 37: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 38: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 39: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 40: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 41: U \\end{array} }\n\nBut at turn 41, action U, which sets y_{42}=9, reached.\n\nAnd H=12.\n\nIn the sequence, the last action is at turn 41.\n\nNow, I think that's it.\n</think>\nTo reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 1)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 30\\) with the minimal number of turns \\(H\\), while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the optimal sequence of actions requires \\(H = 12\\) turns. The actions are chosen to avoid the unsafe times for each freeway, as determined by the car positions and movements.\n\nThe unsafe times for each freeway (relative to \\(t_1 = 30\\), where \\(\\tau = t - 30\\)) are:\n- \\(y=1\\) and \\(y=2\\): unsafe at \\(\\tau = 1, 2, 3, 10, 11, 12\\)\n- \\(y=3\\) and \\(y=4\\): unsafe at \\(\\tau = 2, 3\\)\n- \\(y=5\\): unsafe at \\(\\tau = 0, 4\\)\n- \\(y=6\\): always safe\n- \\(y=7\\) and \\(y=8\\): unsafe at \\(\\tau = 0\\)\n\nStarting at \\(\\tau = 0\\) (turn 30) on \\(y=1\\), which is safe at \\(\\tau = 0\\), the only safe action is to move down to \\(y=0\\) to avoid collision on \\(y=1\\) or \\(y=2\\) at \\(\\tau = 1\\). Then, staying at \\(y=0\\) for turns 31 and 32 (\\(\\tau = 1\\) and \\(\\tau = 2\\)) avoids the unsafe conditions on \\(y=1\\) to \\(y=4\\). At turn 33 (\\(\\tau = 3\\)), moving up to \\(y=1\\) is safe, as \\(y=1\\) is safe at \\(\\tau = 4\\) (turn 34). From turn 34 onwards, moving up continuously reaches \\(y=9\\) by turn 42 (\\(\\tau = 12\\)) without encountering any unsafe positions, as the intermediate freeways are safe at the respective times.\n\nThe sequence of actions minimizes \\(H\\) by:\n- Spending turns 30-32 at \\(y=0\\) to avoid early unsafe periods.\n- Moving directly from \\(y=1\\) to \\(y=9\\) in 8 consecutive up actions starting from turn 34, which is the fastest possible ascent given the constraints.\n\nThe actions and resulting positions are:\n\n| Turn \\(t\\) | \\(\\tau = t - 30\\) | Action \\(a_t\\) | New \\(y\\) | Collision Check (at turn \\(t\\), on \\(y_t\\) |\n|------------|-------------------|---------------|-----------|-------------------------------------------|\n| 30         | 0                | D             | 0         | Safe: \\(y=1\\) at \\(\\tau=0\\) safe         |\n| 31         | 1                | S             | 0         | Safe: \\(y=0\\) no cars                    |\n| 32         | 2                | S             | 0         | Safe: \\(y=0\\) no cars                    |\n| 33         | 3                | U             | 1         | Safe: \\(y=0\\) no cars                    |\n| 34         | 4                | U             | 2         | Safe: \\(y=1\\) at \\(\\tau=4\\) safe         |\n| 35         | 5                | U             | 3         | Safe: \\(y=2\\) at \\(\\tau=5\\) safe         |\n| 36         | 6                | U             | 4         | Safe: \\(y=3\\) at \\(\\tau=6\\) safe         |\n| 37         | 7                | U             | 5         | Safe: \\(y=4\\) at \\(\\tau=7\\) safe         |\n| 38         | 8                | U             | 6         | Safe: \\(y=5\\) at \\(\\tau=8\\) safe         |\n| 39         | 9                | U             | 7         | Safe: \\(y=6\\) always safe                |\n| 40         | 10               | U             | 8         | Safe: \\(y=7\\) at \\(\\tau=10\\) safe        |\n| 41         | 11               | U             | 9         | Safe: \\(y=8\\) at \\(\\tau=11\\) safe        |\n\nAt turn 42 (\\(\\tau = 12\\)), the position is \\((0, 9)\\), which is safe with no cars.

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 32. The player starts at (0,0) and needs to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on freeways 1 to 8 (y=1 to y=8). Collision occurs at turn T if the player is on a freeway k (i.e., y_T = k) and at that turn, for any car on that freeway, the car's span at turn T includes 0 (the x-coordinate where the player is).\n\nImportant note: The player is only on the freeway of the row they are currently in at the start of the turn. When moving (U or D), at turn T the player is on the freeway corresponding to y_T. If at turn T the player moves to a new row, then at turn T they are still on the old row. So when moving from y to y+1 at turn T, during turn T the player is on row y, and at the next turn (T+1) they will be on row y+1.\n\nWe are to output a sequence of actions starting at turn t1 (32) until we reach y=9.\n\nThe grid has 10 rows: y=0 (start) to y=9 (goal). The freeways (with cars) are from y=1 to y=8.\n\nWe need to compute the positions of the cars at any future turn T (relative to t1, so T = 32, 33, ...). The car update:\n\nFor a car at t1 (current turn) with head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s:\n\n- If left-moving: then at time T, the span becomes [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]\n- But note: the table shows right-moving cars. Actually, the table says \"direction\" and all are \"right\". So we only have right-moving cars.\n\nFor a right-moving car: \n  At time t1: span is [τ, h] (because head is at h and tail at τ, and since it's right-moving, the head is the front so h > τ). \n  Then at time T: the car moves right, so the entire span shifts right by s*(T-t1). \n  Therefore: new head = h + s*(T-t1), new tail = τ + s*(T-t1). \n  So the span at T is [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n\nCollision condition at turn T: if the player is at (0, k) (so on freeway k) and for any car on freeway k, the span at T includes 0, then collision.\n\nWe start at turn 32 at (0,0). We are not on any freeway (freeways start at y=1) so we don't check for collision at y=0. We must avoid collisions on freeways 1 to 8.\n\nGoal: reach (0,9) as quickly as possible.\n\nWe can move up (U: y+1), down (D: y-1), or stay (S: y unchanged). But note: we start at 0 and goal is 9, so we must go up. We cannot go below 0 or above 9.\n\nWe are to find the minimal number of turns H and the sequence of actions.\n\nApproach:\nWe can try to simulate the movement and check for collisions. Since we are minimizing the number of turns, we would like to go up as fast as possible. However, we must avoid the cars on the freeways we step on.\n\nNote: We are at turn 32. We are going to simulate turns starting at 32.\n\nAt turn 32: we are at (0,0). We choose an action for turn 32. Then at turn 33, we update our position and check if we are on a freeway that has a car whose span at turn 33 includes 0? Actually, at turn 32 we are at y=0. When we take an action at turn 32, we update to y_{33} = y_{32} + Δy.\n\nBut note: during turn 32, we are at y=0. Then we move to a new y at turn 33. So we only check collisions when we are on a freeway (y from 1 to 8) at the start of a turn? Actually, the collision condition is: at turn T, if we are on freeway y_T (which is between 1 and 8) and at that turn T, the car spans on that freeway include 0.\n\nSo when we are at a turn T, we are at position (0, y_T). Then we choose an action a_T, which will update our y for the next turn. But at turn T, we are still at y_T. Therefore, if y_T is between 1 and 8, we must check for collisions with cars on freeway y_T at turn T.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\n- At turn T (starting at T0=32):\n   - We are at (0, y_T)\n   - If y_T is between 1 and 8, then check if any car on freeway y_T at turn T has a span that includes 0. If yes, then collision -> invalid.\n   - Then we choose an action a_T (U, D, S) that leads to y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy, which must be in [0,9].\n\nWe start at T=32 at (0,0). Since y=0 is not a freeway (freeways are 1-8), we don't check. Then we choose an action.\n\nWe want to minimize H, so we would prefer to go up as much as possible. But we must avoid the cars.\n\nWe'll compute the positions of the cars for each freeway at each turn we might be on that freeway.\n\nWe are going to do a BFS (breadth-first search) or Dijkstra (but all moves cost 1) in state (turn, y). The state is the current turn (relative to 32) and the current y. We start at (0,0) at step 0 (which is turn 32). We want to reach y=9.\n\nBut note: the turn number matters because the car positions change with time.\n\nWe'll simulate from turn 32 onward. We are going to compute the car positions for each freeway at each future turn.\n\nHowever, note that the cars are periodic? Actually, the freeway is infinite, but the cars move at constant speed. The collision condition depends on the car spans at a specific turn.\n\nBut note: the car spans are linear in time. So for a car on freeway k with initial (at t1=32) head h, tail τ, speed s, and direction right, then at turn T (>=32), the span is [τ + s*(T-32), h + s*(T-32)].\n\nWe need to check for each freeway k and turn T if 0 is in the span of any car on freeway k at turn T.\n\nBut note: the freeway k has multiple cars? Yes, the table lists multiple cars per freeway.\n\nFor example, freeway 1 at turn 32 has three cars: \n  car1: h=-32, τ=-43, d=right, s=4 -> span at 32: [-43 + 4*(0) = -43, -32 + 4*(0) = -32] -> so [-43,-32] (but note: since it's right-moving, the tail is the leftmost and head the rightmost). Actually, the table says: for right-moving, the span at t1 is [τ, h] = [-43, -32]. Then at time T, it becomes [τ + s*(T-32), h + s*(T-32)] = [-43 + 4*(T-32), -32 + 4*(T-32)].\n\nSimilarly, the other cars on freeway 1: \n  car2: (4, -7, right, 4) -> wait, that doesn't make sense because 4 is the head and -7 is the tail? Then at t1: span = [-7,4]. Then at T: [-7+4*(T-32), 4+4*(T-32)].\n  car3: (40,29,right,4) -> [29,40] at t1? Actually, the table says: (head, tail) = (40,29). Then the tail is 29 and head is 40? But 29<40, so that's fine. Then span at T: [29+4*(T-32), 40+4*(T-32)].\n\nBut note: the description says \"head\" and \"tail\". For a right-moving car, the head is the front (rightmost) and tail is the rear (leftmost). So the span is [tail, head]. Therefore, the car covers the interval [tail, head].\n\nNow, we have to check at turn T on freeway k: if the player is at (0, k) at turn T, then we require that 0 is not in the span of any car on that freeway at that turn.\n\nWe'll precompute for each freeway k (1 to 8) and for each turn T (starting from 32) the set of T for which freeway k is safe (i.e., no car spans include 0).\n\nBut note: we don't know how far in time we need to go. We are going to do BFS until we reach y=9. Since we can only move one step per turn, the maximum turns we might need is 9 (if we go up every turn) but we might have to wait or detour? Actually, we can only go up, down, or stay. But we start at 0 and goal is 9, so we must go up at least 9 times. We can also go down or stay, so the minimal H is 9. But we might have to wait because of cars, so H might be more than 9.\n\nWe'll compute the safety of each freeway k at each turn T (for T>=32) for a reasonable time window. Since the minimal H is 9, and we might have to wait a few turns, let's consider up to 20 turns? But the cars are moving and the spans are shifting. We can compute the condition for a car to cover 0.\n\nFor a car on freeway k with tail τ, head h, speed s, at turn T (relative to t0=32, let dt = T-32), then the span is [τ + s*dt, h + s*dt].\n\nWe need 0 to be outside [τ + s*dt, h + s*dt] for every car on that freeway.\n\nSo for a given freeway k and dt, we can check all its cars.\n\nLet's list the cars for each freeway:\n\nFreeway 1 (three cars):\n  car1: τ=-43, h=-32, s=4 -> [ -43+4*dt, -32+4*dt ]\n  car2: τ=-7, h=4, s=4 -> [ -7+4*dt, 4+4*dt ]\n  car3: τ=29, h=40, s=4 -> [ 29+4*dt, 40+4*dt ]\n\nWe need 0 not in any of these intervals.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same as freeway 1? The table says:\n  Freeway 2: same cars as freeway 1? \n    (-32,-43,right,4) -> wait, the table says: \n      Freeway 2: (-32, -43, right, 4) -> this is the same as freeway1's car1? But note: the table says head=-32, tail=-43? Then the span is [-43, -32] at t1. Then same as freeway1 car1.\n    (4,-7,right,4) -> same as freeway1 car2.\n    (40,29,right,4) -> same as freeway1 car3? But freeway1 car3 was (40,29) -> so tail=29, head=40? But freeway2 says (40,29) -> same.\n\nSo freeway1 and freeway2 are identical? \n\nBut freeway3 and 4 are also identical? \n  Freeway3: (-42,-53,right,6), (36,25,right,6), (0,-11,right,6)\n  Freeway4: same.\n\nFreeway5: (-24,-35,right,12), (60,49,right,12), (24,13,right,12)\nFreeway6: only one car: (60,49,right,3) -> tail=49, head=60, s=3 -> [49+3*dt, 60+3*dt]\nFreeway7: (48,25,right,24) -> [25+24*dt, 48+24*dt]\nFreeway8: same as freeway7.\n\nNow, we need to compute for each freeway k (1 to 8) and for dt>=0 (starting at dt=0 for turn 32) the safety: safe if 0 is not in any of the car intervals on that freeway.\n\nWe'll compute for dt from 0 to, say, 20 (since minimal steps is 9, and we might have to wait up to 20 turns).\n\nLet's compute for each freeway:\n\nFreeway 1 (and 2) has three cars:\n\ncar1: [-43+4*dt, -32+4*dt]\ncar2: [-7+4*dt, 4+4*dt]\ncar3: [29+4*dt, 40+4*dt]\n\nWe need 0 to be outside these intervals.\n\nSimilarly, freeway3 (and 4):\n\ncar1: [-53+6*dt, -42+6*dt]\ncar2: [25+6*dt, 36+6*dt]   # because the car is (36,25) -> head=36, tail=25 -> [25,36] at dt=0\ncar3: [-11+6*dt, 0+6*dt]   # because (0,-11): head=0, tail=-11 -> [-11,0] at dt=0\n\nNote: at dt=0, car3: [-11,0] -> includes 0? Yes, because 0 is the head? So at turn 32, freeway3 and 4 are unsafe? But we are not on freeway3 at turn32, but if we are at turn T on freeway3, then we must avoid.\n\nSimilarly, freeway5:\n\ncar1: [-35+12*dt, -24+12*dt]\ncar2: [49+12*dt, 60+12*dt]\ncar3: [13+12*dt, 24+12*dt]\n\nFreeway6: one car: [49+3*dt, 60+3*dt]\n\nFreeway7 (and 8): [25+24*dt, 48+24*dt]\n\nNow, we want to know for each freeway k and for each dt (which is T-32) whether the freeway is safe.\n\nWe'll make a table for dt from 0 to 20 for freeways 1 to 8.\n\nBut note: freeway1 and 2 are the same, 3 and 4 same, 7 and 8 same.\n\nSo we compute:\n\nFreeway1/2:\n  car1: [-43+4*dt, -32+4*dt] -> covers 0 when: -43+4*dt <= 0 <= -32+4*dt -> \n        4*dt <= 43 -> dt <= 43/4 = 10.75 -> so dt=0 to 10: 0 is in the interval? \n        Actually: we need 0 >= -43+4*dt and 0 <= -32+4*dt -> \n        => 4*dt >= 43 -> dt>=11 (ceiling) because 4*10=40<43, 4*11=44>=43 -> so for dt>=11, the interval moves beyond 0? \n        Actually, the interval moves to the right. At dt=10: [-43+40, -32+40] = [-3,8] -> which includes 0? yes.\n        At dt=11: [-43+44, -32+44] = [1,12] -> does not include 0? no, because 0<1.\n        But wait: the interval [1,12] doesn't include 0. So for dt>=11, car1 is safe? Actually, we require 0 to be outside. So for car1, unsafe when 0 is in [ -43+4*dt, -32+4*dt ].\n\n        Solve: \n          -43+4*dt <= 0 <= -32+4*dt\n          => 4*dt <= 43 -> dt<=10.75 -> so for dt=0,1,...,10: unsafe? \n          But at dt=0: [-43,-32] -> 0 is not in this interval (0>-32? no, -32<0, but 0 is greater than -32? and less than -43? no. Actually: -43<=0<=-32? -> 0>=-43 is true, but 0<=-32 is false. So at dt=0: 0 is not in [-43,-32]? \n          Actually, the interval is [-43,-32]. The numbers: -43 to -32, which are negative. 0 is positive? So 0 is not in the interval. \n\n        Correction: \n          The condition for 0 to be in [a,b] is a<=0 and 0<=b.\n\n        For car1: \n          a = -43+4*dt, b = -32+4*dt.\n          Condition: a<=0 and 0<=b.\n          => -43+4*dt <= 0 -> 4*dt<=43 -> dt<=10.75 -> dt<=10 (integer)\n          and 0<= -32+4*dt -> 4*dt>=32 -> dt>=8.\n\n        So for car1: unsafe only when 8<=dt<=10.\n\n        Similarly, car2: [-7+4*dt, 4+4*dt]\n          Condition: -7+4*dt<=0 and 0<=4+4*dt -> \n          First: -7+4*dt<=0 -> 4*dt<=7 -> dt<=1.75 -> dt<=1\n          Second: 0<=4+4*dt -> always true for dt>=0? because 4+4*dt>=4>0.\n          So unsafe when dt<=1? \n          But check: at dt=0: [-7,4] -> 0 in [-7,4] -> unsafe.\n          at dt=1: [-7+4,4+4]=[-3,8] -> unsafe (0 in interval).\n          at dt=2: [1,12] -> safe.\n\n        So car2: unsafe for dt=0,1.\n\n        car3: [29+4*dt, 40+4*dt] -> both positive? so 0 is less than 29+4*dt (which is at least 29) -> so 0 not in the interval. Always safe.\n\n        Therefore, freeway1/2 is unsafe when either car1 or car2 is unsafe. So:\n          dt=0: unsafe (car2)\n          dt=1: unsafe (car2)\n          dt=2: safe? \n          dt=3: safe\n          ... \n          dt=8: unsafe (car1)\n          dt=9: unsafe (car1)\n          dt=10: unsafe (car1)\n          dt>=11: safe.\n\n        So freeway1/2 safe for dt in {2,3,4,5,6,7} and dt>=11.\n\nFreeway3/4:\n\ncar1: [-53+6*dt, -42+6*dt] -> \n  Condition: -53+6*dt<=0 and 0<=-42+6*dt\n  First: 6*dt<=53 -> dt<=8.83 -> dt<=8\n  Second: 0<=-42+6*dt -> 6*dt>=42 -> dt>=7\n  So unsafe for dt=7,8.\n\ncar2: [25+6*dt, 36+6*dt] -> always positive -> safe.\n\ncar3: [-11+6*dt, 0+6*dt] -> \n  Condition: -11+6*dt<=0 and 0<=0+6*dt -> \n  First: 6*dt<=11 -> dt<=1.83 -> dt<=1\n  Second: 0<=6*dt -> always true for dt>=0? but at dt=0: 0<=0 -> true. So unsafe for dt=0,1.\n\nBut note: the car3 at dt=0: [-11,0] -> includes 0? yes, because the interval is [-11,0] and 0 is the head? so 0 is included.\n\nSo freeway3/4 unsafe when:\n  dt=0: unsafe (car3)\n  dt=1: unsafe (car3)\n  dt=2,3,4,5,6: safe? \n  dt=7: unsafe (car1)\n  dt=8: unsafe (car1)\n  dt=9: safe? because car1: at dt=9: [-53+54, -42+54] = [1,12] -> safe. car3: [ -11+54, 0+54] = [43,54] -> safe.\n  So safe for dt in {2,3,4,5,6} and dt>=9.\n\nFreeway5:\n\ncar1: [-35+12*dt, -24+12*dt] -> \n  Condition: -35+12*dt<=0 and 0<=-24+12*dt\n  First: 12*dt<=35 -> dt<=2.91 -> dt<=2\n  Second: 0<=-24+12*dt -> 12*dt>=24 -> dt>=2\n  So unsafe only at dt=2.\n\ncar2: [49+12*dt, 60+12*dt] -> always positive -> safe.\ncar3: [13+12*dt, 24+12*dt] -> always positive -> safe.\n\nSo freeway5 unsafe only at dt=2.\n\nFreeway6:\n\ncar: [49+3*dt, 60+3*dt] -> always positive -> always safe.\n\nFreeway7/8:\n\ncar: [25+24*dt, 48+24*dt] -> always positive -> always safe.\n\nSummary of unsafe times (dt = T-32) for each freeway:\n\nFreeway1/2: unsafe at dt=0,1,8,9,10\nFreeway3/4: unsafe at dt=0,1,7,8\nFreeway5: unsafe at dt=2\nFreeway6: always safe\nFreeway7/8: always safe\n\nBut note: freeway6 and 7/8 are always safe? So we can step on them at any time.\n\nNow, we plan the movement from y=0 at dt=0 (turn32) to y=9. We have 9 freeways to cross: y=1,2,...,8, and then we need to be at y=9.\n\nWe are at turn T (dt=T-32) and at a row y. We can move U, D, S.\n\nWe want the minimal H (number of turns) to reach y=9.\n\nWe'll do a BFS over (dt, y). The state: (dt, y). We start at (0,0). Goal: any state with y=9.\n\nAt each state (dt, y), we can choose an action: U, D, S. Then next state: (dt+1, y') where y' = y+1 (if U), y-1 (if D), or y (if S), and y' must be in [0,9].\n\nBut when we are at state (dt, y), we are at turn T=32+dt and row y. Then we must check: if y is between 1 and 8 (freeway), then we require that freeway y is safe at dt. Otherwise, if y=0 or y=9, we don't check (no freeway at y=0 or y=9).\n\nNote: the goal is to be at (0,9). When we are at y=9, we are done. But note: we are at y=9 at the start of a turn? Then we don't need to check for freeway (since freeways are 1-8). So we can stop when we reach y=9.\n\nWe must avoid being on a freeway when it is unsafe.\n\nWe'll do BFS (since all step costs are 1) to find the minimal H (which is the number of turns from start, so the dt when we reach y=9 is H, and we have taken H actions starting from dt=0).\n\nThe actions: we start at dt=0, then we take an action at dt=0 (turn32) to move to the next state at dt=1 (turn33) with a new y. But note: when we are at (dt, y), that means at turn T=32+dt we are at row y. And we are going to take an action at that turn? Actually, the state (dt, y) is at the beginning of turn T=32+dt. Then we choose an action that will update the y for the next turn. However, during the entire turn T we are at row y, so if y is in [1,8] we must check that freeway y is safe at time T (i.e., at dt).\n\nSo in the BFS, when we are at state (dt, y), we first check if we are on a freeway (y in [1,8]) and if that freeway is unsafe at dt, then we cannot be in that state -> so we skip that state.\n\nThen, from state (dt, y) we can choose an action (U, D, S) to go to (dt+1, y') where y' = y+1, y-1, or y (if valid).\n\nWe start at (0,0). Since y=0 is safe (no freeway), we can start.\n\nGoal: any state (dt, 9) for any dt.\n\nWe want the minimal dt when we reach y=9? Actually, the number of turns H is the number of actions we take. We start at turn32 (dt=0) and we take actions at turns 32, 33, ... until we are at y=9 at the start of a turn. The total number of actions is the number of turns we simulate, which is H = (last turn index - 31) ? \n\nActually, we start at turn32 (dt=0) and we take H actions: at turn32 (action0), turn33 (action1), ... turn32+H-1 (action H-1). Then at the next turn (turn32+H) we are at y_{32+H}. We require that at turn32+H we are at y=9? \n\nBut note: the problem says: we want a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t} for t=0 to H-1 such that after H turns (i.e., after applying H actions) we are at (0,9). \n\nSo after H actions, we are at turn32+H, and we are at position (0, y_{32+H}) and we require y_{32+H}=9.\n\nTherefore, in our BFS, we are at state (dt, y) meaning: at turn32+dt, we are at row y. We have taken dt actions so far (from dt=0 to dt-1). But wait: we start at dt=0 (turn32) without having taken any action? \n\nActually, the problem: we are at turn32 at (0,0). Then we choose an action for turn32 (which is the first action). Then after that action, we are at turn33 at y_{33}. \n\nSo the state (dt, y) in our BFS should represent: after having taken dt actions (so at turn32+dt) we are at row y. \n\nThen the initial state is (0,0). Then we take an action at turn32 (which is the first action) and go to (1, y1). Then at state (1, y1), we are at turn33.\n\nAt state (dt, y), we are at turn32+dt and row y. Then we must check: if y is in [1,8], then we require freeway y is safe at time T=32+dt (which is dt in our relative time).\n\nThen we choose an action to go to (dt+1, y') where y' = y+1, y-1, or y (if within [0,9]).\n\nWe stop when we reach a state (dt,9).\n\nWe want the minimal dt (which is H) such that we can reach (dt,9).\n\nWe'll do BFS in the state (dt, y). We note that y is in [0,9] and dt can be from 0 upward. We are looking for the minimal dt.\n\nWe'll use a queue: start with (0,0). Then expand to next states.\n\nBut note: we must avoid states that are unsafe.\n\nWe'll keep a visited set: states (dt,y) that we have already visited to avoid duplicates.\n\nWe'll record the path: we can store the parent's state and the action taken.\n\nLet's simulate:\n\nStart: (0,0) -> safe (y=0, no freeway).\n\nFrom (0,0): we can choose U, D, S. But D: y=-1 -> invalid. So we can do U or S.\n\nOption1: U -> next state: (1,1)\nOption2: S -> next state: (1,0)\n\nNow, at state (1,1): we are at turn33 (dt=1) and freeway1. We check freeway1 at dt=1: unsafe (from our table: freeway1 unsafe at dt=1). So we cannot be at (1,1) -> skip.\n\nAt state (1,0): safe (y=0). Then from (1,0): we can do U, S, D (D would go to -1 -> invalid). So:\n  U -> (2,1)\n  S -> (2,0)\n\nNow, state (2,1): freeway1 at dt=2 -> safe? from our table: freeway1 safe at dt=2 (because dt=2 is not in {0,1,8,9,10} -> safe). So we can be at (2,1).\n\nState (2,0): safe.\n\nNow, from (2,1): we can go U, D, S.\n  U: (3,2) -> freeway2 at dt=3: check freeway2 (same as freeway1) at dt=3: safe? yes (dt=3 is safe for freeway1/2).\n  D: (3,0) -> safe (y=0)\n  S: (3,1) -> freeway1 at dt=3: safe? yes.\n\nFrom (2,0): \n  U: (3,1) -> freeway1 at dt=3: safe.\n  S: (3,0)\n  D: invalid.\n\nSo we have states: (3,2), (3,0), (3,1)\n\nWe continue.\n\nWe want to reach y=9 as quickly as possible. The minimal possible H is 9 (if we go up every turn). But we started at (0,0). After 9 actions: at dt=9, we would be at y=9? Only if we go up every time. But we had to wait at the beginning: we couldn't go up at dt=0 (because then at dt=1 we were at y=1 which was unsafe). Then at dt=1 we were at y=0. Then at dt=2 we went to y=1 (safe). Then from dt=2 (y=1) we can go up to y=2 at dt=3, then to y=3 at dt=4, and so on.\n\nBut we must check each freeway we step on.\n\nWe have freeways 1 to 8. We must ensure that when we are at freeway k at time T (dt = T-32) it is safe.\n\nWe are going to simulate the BFS until we find a path to y=9.\n\nWe'll do a BFS and keep track of the minimal dt for each (y) we have seen? But we might have the same y at a later dt and that might be necessary if we have to wait. But we are looking for minimal dt.\n\nWe'll use a queue and stop when we first reach y=9.\n\nWe'll also avoid loops: we can mark state (dt,y) as visited. But note: we might come to the same y at a higher dt, which is not useful since we are doing BFS by dt (so we are expanding by increasing dt). Therefore, we can break if we have visited (y) at a lower dt? Actually, if we have been at (y) at a lower dt, then we don't need to consider a higher dt. So we can keep an array min_dt[y] = minimal dt that we have reached y.\n\nBut note: the safety condition depends on dt. So two different dt at the same y might lead to different future paths. However, if we have reached y at a lower dt, then we don't need to consider a higher dt because we are doing BFS (and we are expanding by increasing dt). So we can mark visited for (y) once we have reached it? But wait: we might have to wait at a freeway for a while and then proceed. However, if we have reached y at dt0, then we can always wait at y (by taking S actions) until we want to move. But the minimal dt for reaching y is the best. And then from y we can move at any time. But the safety condition at a freeway y depends on the dt. So if we are at y (freeway) at a higher dt, it might be safe to move then, but if we have already reached y at a lower dt, then we can wait at y (by taking S) until the desired dt? \n\nActually, we can simulate waiting by staying at the same y. So if we have reached (y, dt0) and then we can wait at y until a later dt by taking S actions. Therefore, we don't need to consider a state (y, dt1) if we have already reached y at a lower dt0 (because we can wait from dt0 to dt1 without penalty). Therefore, we can keep an array min_dt[y] = minimal dt at which we have reached y. Then if we reach y again at a higher dt, we skip.\n\nBut note: if we are at a freeway y, then we must be safe at the dt we are at. So if we are at (y, dt0) and we can wait until dt1 (by taking S actions) only if for every dt' in [dt0, dt1] the freeway y is safe? But we might not be able to wait if the freeway becomes unsafe in between.\n\nHowever, in our case, the freeway safety might be periodic? Actually, from our tables, the unsafe intervals are finite. For example, freeway1/2: unsafe only at dt=0,1,8,9,10. So if we are at freeway1 at dt=2, we can wait until dt=7 (by taking 5 S actions) and then move? But we must check that during [2,7] the freeway1 is safe? Yes, because freeway1 is safe at dt=2,3,4,5,6,7? But at dt=7: freeway1 is safe? from our table: freeway1 unsafe at dt=8,9,10 -> so at dt=7, it is safe. Then we can wait until dt=7.\n\nBut how do we know that we can wait? In BFS, we can simulate staying. So from state (dt, y) we generate (dt+1, y) as well. And we check safety at (dt+1, y) if it's a freeway.\n\nBut if we use the min_dt per y, then we only store the minimal dt for which we reached y. Then from that state, we can generate staying and moving. And if we have a lower dt for y, we skip higher ones.\n\nWe'll use:\n\n- dist[y] = minimal dt at which we reached y (initialized to infinity for all y except y=0: dist[0]=0).\n- We use a queue: (dt, y). Start with (0,0).\n\nFor each neighbor (next state) (dt+1, y') from (dt, y) via action a in {U,D,S}:\n\n   if y' is in [0,9] and \n      if y' is in [1,8] then we require that freeway y' is safe at dt+1? \n          Actually, no: at the next state (dt+1, y'), we are at turn32+dt+1 and row y'. Then we must check that if y' is in [1,8] then the freeway y' is safe at time dt+1.\n\n   But note: the state (dt+1, y') is the state at the start of turn T=32+dt+1. Then we are at row y'. So we check freeway safety for that freeway at dt+1.\n\n   Then if we haven't visited y' at a dt' <= dt+1 (i.e., if dt+1 < dist[y']), then we update.\n\nBut note: we might be able to reach y' at a lower dt? So we update only if we found a lower dt.\n\nAlgorithm:\n\nInitialize:\n  dist[0..9] = infinity\n  dist[0] = 0\n  queue = [(0,0)]\n\n  parent[state] = (prev_dt, prev_y, action) to record the path.\n\nWhile queue not empty:\n  pop state (dt, y)\n  if y==9: then we have a solution with H = dt (because we have taken dt actions and we are at y=9 at turn32+dt).\n\n  For each action a in [U, D, S]:\n      y_next = y + (1 if a=U, -1 if a=D, 0 if a=S)\n      if y_next not in [0,9]: skip\n      dt_next = dt + 1\n      # Now, we are going to be at (dt_next, y_next) meaning at turn32+dt_next we are at y_next.\n      # Check: if y_next is in [1,8] then we must check freeway y_next at time dt_next (relative to 32, so dt_next = T-32).\n      if y_next in [1,8]:\n          if freeway y_next is unsafe at dt_next -> skip\n      # If y_next is 0 or 9, no check.\n\n      if dt_next < dist[y_next]:\n          dist[y_next] = dt_next\n          parent[y_next] = (dt, y, a)   # but note: we are storing per y_next? Actually, we want the path. Alternatively, we can store the entire path? Or store parent state (dt,y) and the action.\n\n          push (dt_next, y_next) to queue.\n\n  Note: we also consider staying? We did: a=S is included.\n\nBut note: we are not generating (dt+1, y) from (dt,y) by staying? Yes, by a=S: y_next = y.\n\nBut we do: if we are at (dt,y) and we choose S, then next state is (dt+1, y). Then we check: if y is in [1,8] then we check at dt+1? And then update.\n\nBut we might have visited (dt+1, y) already? But we are doing BFS by increasing dt, so we are expanding minimal dt first. Therefore, when we reach a state (y, dt) we know that we have the minimal dt for that y.\n\nWe break when we pop a state (dt,9) -> then H=dt.\n\nBut note: we start at (0,0). Then we generate (1,1) and (1,0). Then (1,1) is unsafe -> skip. Then (1,0) is safe -> we generate (2,1) and (2,0). Then (2,1) is safe -> then we generate (3,2), (3,0), (3,1). Then (3,2) is freeway2 at dt=3: safe. Then we continue.\n\nWe need to compute the safety for each freeway at the next dt.\n\nWe'll write a helper function: is_safe(k, dt) that returns True if freeway k is safe at relative time dt.\n\nGiven our tables:\n\nWe have:\n\ndef is_safe(k, dt):\n    if k==1 or k==2:\n        # unsafe at dt in [0,1] or [8,10] -> so unsafe at dt=0,1,8,9,10\n        if dt in [0,1,8,9,10]:\n            return False\n        else:\n            return True\n    elif k==3 or k==4:\n        # unsafe at dt=0,1,7,8\n        if dt in [0,1,7,8]:\n            return False\n        else:\n            return True\n    elif k==5:\n        # unsafe at dt=2\n        if dt==2:\n            return False\n        else:\n            return True\n    elif k==6 or k==7 or k==8:\n        # always safe\n        return True\n\nBut note: freeway6: k=6 -> safe. freeway7 and 8: k=7,8 -> safe.\n\nNow, we simulate BFS:\n\nInitialize:\n  dist = [inf]*10\n  dist[0] = 0\n  queue = deque([(0,0)])\n  parent = {}  # key: (dt,y) -> (prev_dt, prev_y, action) OR we store for each state (dt,y) the parent and action.\n\n  Alternatively, we can store for each y the best state (lowest dt) and then from there we reconstruct the path by storing the action that led to that state and the previous state.\n\n  We'll have an array: prev[dt][y] = (prev_dt, prev_y, action) but dt can be large? \n\n  Instead, we store for each state (dt,y) the parent state and the action taken to get to (dt,y). Then when we reach (dt,9), we backtrack.\n\n  But we break when we first reach a state with y=9 (since we are doing BFS by dt, the first time we hit y=9 will be the minimal H).\n\n  We'll use a dictionary: parent[(dt,y)] = (prev_dt, prev_y, action) \n      but note: the state (dt,y) is generated from (prev_dt, prev_y) by taking an action at (prev_dt, prev_y) to go to (dt,y) with dt=prev_dt+1.\n\n  Actually: the action is taken at state (prev_dt, prev_y) to go to (dt, y) where dt=prev_dt+1.\n\n  We start: state (0,0) has no parent.\n\nSteps:\n\ndt=0, y=0 -> safe (y=0, no check). Then we generate:\n\n  U: y_next=1 -> dt_next=1 -> check: freeway1 at dt=1 -> unsafe -> skip.\n  D: invalid.\n  S: y_next=0 -> dt_next=1 -> check: y=0 -> safe. Then we set dist[0]=inf initially? But we already have (0,0) with dt=0. Now we are generating (1,0). Since 1 < inf, we update dist[0]=1? That's not right: we are at y=0 at dt=1. But we were at y=0 at dt=0. We don't want to update dist[0] to 1 because we can be at y=0 at dt=0 and then also at dt=1. But we want to record the state (1,0) because we might need to wait.\n\n  Actually, we want to consider (1,0) as a new state. We set dist[0] to the minimal dt that we have reached y=0. So we started at 0, then we can get to 0 again at dt=1? But we are doing BFS: we expand (0,0) and then we generate (1,0). Then we set dist[0] = min(dist[0], 1) -> but then we skip because 1>0? We don't skip: we update only if we have a lower dt. But we don't have a lower dt for y=0 than 0. So we skip? \n\n  However, we must consider that we might need to wait at y=0. But from (0,0) we can go to (1,0) and then from (1,0) we can go to (2,1) which is safe. So we must consider (1,0).\n\n  How to handle: we don't use dist[y] as a single value. We use state (dt,y). We mark visited per state (dt,y). But then the state space is infinite? But dt is bounded by ...? We can set a limit, say 20.\n\n  Alternatively, we can avoid duplicates: if we have been at (y) at the same or lower dt, we skip. But if we have been at y at a lower dt, then we don't need to consider a higher dt? As argued, because we can wait at a freeway? But if we are at a non-freeway (y=0 or y=9) then we can wait arbitrarily? \n\n  Actually, at y=0, we can wait arbitrarily (by staying) and it's always safe. Similarly at y=9. But at freeways, we might be limited by the safety.\n\n  However, we are doing BFS by increasing dt. So the first time we reach y=9 will be the minimal dt. And for states that we have reached at a given y at a lower dt, we don't need to consider a higher dt for the same y because we can always wait from the lower dt to the higher dt? But wait: we cannot necessarily wait at a freeway for an arbitrary time because it might become unsafe. \n\n  Therefore, we must consider multiple visits to the same y at different dt.\n\n  We'll do: we keep a 2D visited array: visited[dt][y] for dt in a range (say 0 to 50) and y in 0..9. \n\n  Given the minimal H is 9, 50 is safe.\n\nLet's code the BFS with a queue and a visited set for (dt,y).\n\nSteps:\n\n  from collections import deque\n  visited = set()  # store (dt,y)\n  queue = deque()\n  start = (0,0)\n  visited.add((0,0))\n  queue.append((0,0))\n  parent = {}  # parent[(dt,y)] = (prev_dt, prev_y, action) that led to (dt,y). For start: parent[(0,0)] = None\n\n  while queue:\n      (dt,y) = queue.popleft()\n      if y == 9:\n          break\n      for a in ['U','D','S']:\n          if a=='U': y_next = y+1\n          elif a=='D': y_next = y-1\n          else: y_next = y\n          if y_next <0 or y_next>9: \n              continue\n          dt_next = dt+1\n          # Check if we are at a freeway: y_next in [1,8] -> then check safety at dt_next\n          if y_next in [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]:\n              if not is_safe(y_next, dt_next): \n                  continue\n          # Otherwise, safe (if y_next==0 or 9, no check, safe)\n          if (dt_next, y_next) in visited:\n              continue\n          visited.add((dt_next, y_next))\n          parent[(dt_next, y_next)] = (dt, y, a)   # from (dt,y) by action a we went to (dt_next,y_next)\n          queue.append((dt_next, y_next))\n\n  Then when we break at (dt,y=9), we have the minimal H = dt.\n\n  Then we backtrack to get the actions.\n\n  The actions are taken at the previous states. \n\n  How to backtrack:\n\n      We have a state (H,9) -> that's the goal. \n      Then we find the parent: (dt_prev, y_prev, a_last) = parent[(H,9)]\n      Then the last action (at turn32+H-1) is a_last.\n\n      Then we go to (dt_prev, y_prev) and so on until we reach (0,0).\n\n      The sequence of actions: from the earliest to the latest? But we need from turn32 to turn32+H-1.\n\n      So we backtrack from (H,9) to (0,0) and reverse the actions.\n\nBut note: the action a_last is taken at state (dt_prev, y_prev) at turn32+dt_prev (which is the (dt_prev)-th action) to get to (H,9) at turn32+H.\n\n      Actually: at state (dt_prev, y_prev) we take action a_last and then we are at state (dt_prev+1, y_next). And we know that dt_prev+1 = H? \n\n      So the last action (the action at turn32+H-1) is the one that leads to (H,9). And the state at the beginning of turn32+H-1 is (dt_prev, y_prev) = (H-1, y_prev). Then we take action a_last to go to (H,9).\n\n      Therefore, the actions are:\n\n          turn32: first action\n          ...\n          turn32+H-1: last action\n\n      We backtrack: we start at the goal (H,9) and get the action a_{H-1} taken at (H-1, y_prev). Then from (H-1, y_prev) we get the action a_{H-2} taken at (H-2, y_prev2), and so on until (0,0).\n\n      Then we reverse the list.\n\nNow, we simulate the BFS until we reach y=9.\n\nWe'll write the is_safe function as above.\n\nBut note: freeway numbers: we have freeway1 to freeway8. The freeway number is the row number. So when we are at row y, the freeway number is y.\n\nSo is_safe(y, dt) for y in [1,8].\n\nWe'll code:\n\ndef is_safe(k, dt):\n    # k: freeway number (which is the row number, so k in [1,8])\n    if k==1 or k==2:\n        if dt in [0,1,8,9,10]:\n            return False\n        else:\n            return True\n    elif k==3 or k==4:\n        if dt in [0,1,7,8]:\n            return False\n        else:\n            return True\n    elif k==5:\n        if dt == 2:\n            return False\n        else:\n            return True\n    elif k in [6,7,8]:\n        return True\n\nNow, BFS:\n\nWe start at (0,0). Then we generate:\n\n  (0,0) -> actions: U -> (1,1): but k=1 at dt=1 -> unsafe -> skip.\n            S -> (1,0): safe -> new state.\n\nFrom (1,0): \n   actions: \n        U -> (2,1): k=1 at dt=2 -> safe? not in [0,1,8,9,10] -> safe -> new state (2,1)\n        S -> (2,0): safe -> new state (2,0)\n        D: invalid.\n\nFrom (2,1):\n   actions:\n        U -> (3,2): k=2 at dt=3 -> safe? freeway2 same as freeway1: at dt=3 -> safe -> new state (3,2)\n        D -> (3,0): safe -> new state (3,0)\n        S -> (3,1): k=1 at dt=3 -> safe -> new state (3,1)\n\nFrom (2,0):\n        U -> (3,1): safe -> already generated? we are going to generate (3,1) again? So we need to avoid duplicates. We mark (3,1) as visited? We haven't visited it yet. So we generate it. But from (2,0) we generate (3,1). Then from (2,1) we also generate (3,1). But we mark (3,1) as visited when we first generate it.\n\n        But we are doing BFS: we expand by increasing dt. So we expand dt=0, then dt=1, then dt=2, then dt=3. So we will generate (3,1) twice? But we check visited.\n\n        So we generate (3,1) from (2,1) and then from (2,0) we see it's visited -> skip.\n\n        Similarly, (3,0) from (2,0): D -> (3,-1) invalid. So only U and S: \n            U: (3,1) -> already visited? not yet. We generate (3,1) from (2,1) first? Then when (2,0) tries to generate (3,1), we skip.\n\n        So we have: (3,2), (3,0), (3,1) from (2,1) and (3,1) from (2,0) is skipped.\n\nNow, from (3,2): \n   actions:\n        U -> (4,3): freeway3 at dt=4 -> safe? freeway3: unsafe at dt=0,1,7,8 -> 4 is safe -> new state (4,3)\n        D -> (4,1): freeway1 at dt=4 -> safe -> new state (4,1)\n        S -> (4,2): freeway2 at dt=4 -> safe -> new state (4,2)\n\nFrom (3,0):\n   actions:\n        U -> (4,1): freeway1 at dt=4 -> safe -> new state (4,1)\n        S -> (4,0): safe -> new state (4,0)\n        D: invalid.\n\nFrom (3,1):\n   actions:\n        U -> (4,2): freeway2 at dt=4 -> safe -> new state (4,2) [but we might have generated from (3,2) already? but we are at dt=3, so we generate (4,2) and if we haven't seen (4,2) then we add. But we haven't seen any state at dt=4 yet.\n        D -> (4,0): safe -> new state (4,0) [but also generated from (3,0) by S? and from (3,0) by U: (4,1) and S: (4,0)]\n        S -> (4,1): safe -> new state (4,1)\n\nSo we have multiple ways to reach the same state? But we mark visited per (dt,y). So at dt=4, we will have multiple states: (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3)\n\nWe continue until we hit y=9.\n\nWe'll write a small script? or do it by hand until we get to y=9 with minimal dt.\n\nMinimal dt: we want to go up as fast as possible.\n\nWe start:\n\ndt=0: y=0\ndt=1: y=0  (because we had to wait at dt=0: we took S)\ndt=2: y=1  (from dt=1: y=0 -> U to y=1)\ndt=3: y=2  (from dt=2: y=1 -> U to y=2)\ndt=4: y=3  (from dt=3: y=2 -> U to y=3) -> freeway3 at dt=4: safe? yes (only unsafe at 0,1,7,8)\ndt=5: y=4  (U) -> freeway4 at dt=5: same as freeway3: safe? yes (unsafe at 0,1,7,8 -> 5 is safe)\ndt=6: y=5  (U) -> freeway5 at dt=6: unsafe only at dt=2 -> safe.\ndt=7: y=6  (U) -> freeway6: always safe -> safe.\ndt=8: y=7  (U) -> freeway7: always safe -> safe.\ndt=9: y=8  (U) -> freeway8: always safe -> safe.\ndt=10: y=9 -> goal.\n\nSo H=10.\n\nBut is that safe? Let me check the freeways we stepped on:\n\ndt=2: y=1 -> freeway1 at dt=2: safe? yes (unsafe at 0,1,8,9,10 -> 2 is safe).\ndt=3: y=2 -> freeway2 at dt=3: safe? same as freeway1: safe.\ndt=4: y=3 -> freeway3 at dt=4: safe? yes (unsafe at 0,1,7,8 -> 4 safe).\ndt=5: y=4 -> freeway4 at dt=5: safe? same as freeway3: safe.\ndt=6: y=5 -> freeway5 at dt=6: safe? yes (only unsafe at 2).\ndt=7: y=6 -> freeway6: safe.\ndt=8: y=7 -> freeway7: safe.\ndt=9: y=8 -> freeway8: safe.\n\nThen at dt=10: we are at y=9 -> goal.\n\nSo we have a path with H=10.\n\nBut can we do better? The minimal possible is 9. Why didn't we get 9?\n\nBecause we had to wait at the first turn. If we could go up at dt=0, then:\n\ndt=0: y=0 -> take U -> then at dt=1: y=1 -> but freeway1 at dt=1: unsafe -> not allowed.\n\nSo we must wait at least one turn at the beginning.\n\nBut we waited one turn: at dt=0 we took S, then at dt=1 we were at y=0, then at dt=2 we were at y=1. Then we went up every turn. That took 10 turns.\n\nIs there a path with H=9? We need to be at y=9 at dt=9.\n\nWe start at (0,0). Then we take 9 actions. We must have taken at least 9 U to go from 0 to 9. So we must take 9 U and no D and no S. But then:\n\ndt=1: y=1 -> unsafe (freeway1 at dt=1: unsafe) -> fails.\n\nSo no path with H=9.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=10.\n\nThe actions:\n\nWe backtrack the path we described:\n\nWe went:\n\n(0,0) -> S: then (1,0)\n(1,0) -> U: then (2,1)\n(2,1) -> U: then (3,2)\n(3,2) -> U: then (4,3)\n(4,3) -> U: then (5,4)\n(5,4) -> U: then (6,5)\n(6,5) -> U: then (7,6)\n(7,6) -> U: then (8,7)\n(8,7) -> U: then (9,8)\n(9,8) -> U: then (10,9)\n\nSo the actions from turn32 to turn32+9 (which is turn41) are:\n\nturn32: S\nturn33: U\nturn34: U\nturn35: U\nturn36: U\nturn37: U\nturn38: U\nturn39: U\nturn40: U\nturn41: U\n\nBut note: we are at turn32 at the start. Then we take 10 actions: at turn32, turn33, ... turn41. Then at the next turn (turn42) we are at y=9? But we don't take an action at turn42. We are done at the start of turn42? \n\nBut the problem: we take actions until we have taken H actions and then at the next turn we are at (0,9). So the last action is at turn32+9 = turn41. Then at turn42 we are at y=9.\n\nThe sequence of actions: for t from 0 to 9: actions at turn32+t.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 32: S\nTurn 33: U\nTurn 34: U\nTurn 35: U\nTurn 36: U\nTurn 37: U\nTurn 38: U\nTurn 39: U\nTurn 40: U\nTurn 41: U\n\nBut wait: at turn32: we take S -> then at turn33 we are at y=0? Then at turn33: we take U -> then at turn34 we are at y=1? \n\nYes.\n\nWe can also consider: is there a path with H=10 that uses a down move? Probably not necessary because we went straight up.\n\nBut let's see if we can get to y=9 earlier? We have to have 10 turns.\n\nWe started at dt=0 (turn32) and ended at dt=10 (turn42). The number of actions is 10.\n\nBut the problem says: the sequence of actions {a_{t1+t} for t=0 to H-1. So H=10, then t from 0 to 9.\n\nTherefore, we output:\n\nTurn 32: S\nTurn 33: U\nTurn 34: U\nTurn 35: U\nTurn 36: U\nTurn 37: U\nTurn 38: U\nTurn 39: U\nTurn 40: U\nTurn 41: U\n\nBut note: we might have found an alternative path? But this one works.\n\nBut let me check freeway5 at dt=6: we were at y=5 at dt=6. Is freeway5 safe at dt=6? Yes, because unsafe only at dt=2.\n\nAnd the others are safe.\n\nBut what if we try to go faster? We cannot because we had to wait at the first turn.\n\nAlternatively, we could have waited at a different row? But we went straight up.\n\nBut what if we go up to y=1 at dt=2 (as we did), then at dt=3 we go to y=2, then at dt=4 we go to y=3, but then we wait at y=3 for a turn? Then we would go to y=4 at dt=5, then y=5 at dt=6, etc. Then we would be at y=9 at dt=10? Same.\n\nBut if we wait at y=3 at dt=4 (so take S at dt=4) then at dt=5 we are still at y=3. Then we go up at dt=5 to y=4, then at dt=6 to y=5, then ... then at dt=10 to y=8? Then at dt=11 to y=9. That would be H=11.\n\nSo our path is minimal.\n\nBut note: we could avoid the first wait by going up at a later time? But we did: we went up at turn33 (dt=1) to y=1? No, we didn't: we went up at turn33? Actually, at turn32 we took S -> then at turn33 we are at y=0, then at turn33 we take U -> then at turn34 we are at y=1.\n\nBut if we take two S at the beginning? Then:\n\ndt=0: S -> (1,0)\ndt=1: S -> (2,0)\ndt=2: U -> (3,1) -> freeway1 at dt=3: safe -> then we go up: \n   dt=3: U -> (4,2): freeway2 at dt=4: safe? yes -> \n   dt=4: U -> (5,3): freeway3 at dt=5: safe? yes -> \n   dt=5: U -> (6,4): freeway4 at dt=6: safe? yes -> \n   dt=6: U -> (7,5): freeway5 at dt=7: safe? yes -> \n   dt=7: U -> (8,6): freeway6 at dt=8: safe? yes -> \n   dt=8: U -> (9,7): freeway7 at dt=9: safe? yes -> \n   dt=9: U -> (10,8): freeway8 at dt=10: safe? for freeway8: always safe -> \n   dt=10: U -> (11,9): goal.\n\nSo H=11, which is worse.\n\nTherefore, the minimal is 10.\n\nSo we output:\n\nTurn 32: S\nTurn 33: U\nTurn 34: U\nTurn 35: U\nTurn 36: U\nTurn 37: U\nTurn 38: U\nTurn 39: U\nTurn 40: U\nTurn 41: U\n\nBut note: we have 10 actions? The actions are for t=0 to 9 (10 actions).\n\nBut the problem says: a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}} for t=0 to H-1. H=10, so t=0 to 9.\n\nt0=0: turn32+0 = turn32: S\nt1=1: turn33: U\n...\nt9=9: turn41: U\n\nSo we write:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 32: S\nTurn 33: U\nTurn 34: U\nTurn 35: U\nTurn 36: U\nTurn 37: U\nTurn 38: U\nTurn 39: U\nTurn 40: U\nTurn 41: U\n}\n\nBut wait: at the last action (turn41: U) we go from y=8 to y=9. Then at the next turn (turn42) we are at y=9. That is correct.\n\nWe must ensure that we are safe at every step: we never were on a freeway at an unsafe time.\n\nWe were at:\n\nturn32: y=0 -> safe\nturn33: we are at y=0 (because we took S at turn32) -> safe\nturn34: we are at y=1 (after taking U at turn33) -> freeway1 at dt=2? dt = turn - 32: turn34: dt=2 -> safe\nturn35: y=2 -> freeway2 at dt=3 -> safe\nturn36: y=3 -> freeway3 at dt=4 -> safe\nturn37: y=4 -> freeway4 at dt=5 -> safe\nturn38: y=5 -> freeway5 at dt=6 -> safe\nturn39: y=6 -> freeway6 at dt=7 -> safe\nturn40: y=7 -> freeway7 at dt=8 -> safe? freeway7 is always safe -> safe\nturn41: y=8 -> freeway8 at dt=9 -> safe? freeway8 always safe -> safe\n\nThen after turn41, we go to y=9 at turn42.\n\nSo no collision.\n\nTherefore, the answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from \\((0, 0)\\) at turn 32, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), is 10. The sequence of actions is as follows:\n\n- At turn 32, the player stays (S) to remain at \\(y = 0\\), which is safe since it is not a freeway.\n- At turn 33, the player moves up (U) to \\(y = 1\\). This occurs at relative time \\(dt = 1\\) (turn 33), but the freeway check is at the start of the turn, and at turn 33 the player is still at \\(y = 0\\) (safe). The move updates the position to \\(y = 1\\) for turn 34.\n- From turns 34 to 41, the player moves up (U) consecutively. The freeway checks at the start of each turn (when the player is on the freeway) are safe:\n  - Turn 34: \\(y = 1\\) at \\(dt = 2\\) (freeway 1 safe).\n  - Turn 35: \\(y = 2\\) at \\(dt = 3\\) (freeway 2 safe).\n  - Turn 36: \\(y = 3\\) at \\(dt = 4\\) (freeway 3 safe).\n  - Turn 37: \\(y = 4\\) at \\(dt = 5\\) (freeway 4 safe).\n  - Turn 38: \\(y = 5\\) at \\(dt = 6\\) (freeway 5 safe).\n  - Turn 39: \\(y = 6\\) at \\(dt = 7\\) (freeway 6 always safe).\n  - Turn 40: \\(y = 7\\) at \\(dt = 8\\) (freeway 7 always safe).\n  - Turn 41: \\(y = 8\\) at \\(dt = 9\\) (freeway 8 always safe).\n- After the action at turn 41, the player moves to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 42, reaching the goal.\n\nThis sequence ensures the player avoids all car collisions and reaches \\((0, 9)\\) in the minimal number of turns.\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn } 32: \\text{ S} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 33: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 34: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 35: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 36: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 37: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 38: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 39: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 40: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 41: \\text{ U}\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,1) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible without colliding with any cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t₁ = 34.\n\nFirst, I should understand the car movements. Each car has a head and tail, and they move left or right at a given speed. The collision happens only if at turn T, the player is on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there's a car where 0 is in its span at that exact turn.\n\nThe player position changes based on actions: U for up (y increases by 1), D for down (y decreases by 1), S for stay (y stays the same). But y is bounded between 0 and 9, so I can't go below 0 or above 9.\n\nThe goal is to reach y=9. Since I start at y=1, I need to increase y by 8, so minimum turns would be 8 if I could just go up every turn, but I have to avoid cars, so it might take more turns if I need to wait or go down sometimes.\n\nBut going down might not be efficient since I need to go up overall. Also, I can stay in place to avoid cars.\n\nNow, let's list the cars for each freeway. I think \"freeway k\" corresponds to y=k. So for each y from 1 to 8, there are cars.\n\nThe table says \"Freeway k\" and then cars. k from 1 to 8.\n\nFor each car, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed). Direction: right or left. In the update, for left-moving, span moves left, so head decreases; for right-moving, head increases? Let me see the update rule.\n\nFor left-moving car: at turn t₁, span is [h, τ], and at turn T, span is [h - s(T-t₁), τ - s(T-t₁)]. Since it's left-moving, head should be on the left? No, in the notation, for left-moving, it says \"head is at h, tail at τ\", and span is [h, τ], but then when moving left, both decrease, so if h and τ are positions, and it's moving left, the head should be the leading part.\n\nI think I need to interpret the head and tail properly.\n\nIn the car update:\n\n- Left-moving: span(t₁) = [h, τ] → span(T) = [h - s(T-t₁), τ - s(T-t₁)]\n\nBut if it's moving left, and [h, τ] with h and τ, if h > τ, then [h, τ] might not make sense if h > τ, since span should be from left to right or something.\n\nI think there might be inconsistency in notation.\n\nLet me read carefully.\n\nFor left-moving car: \"head is at h, tail is at τ\" and span is [h, τ]. But when moving left, both decrease, so the span shifts left.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving: span(t₁) = [τ, h]? It says: \"Span(t₁) = [τ, h]\" for right-moving? No.\n\nLook: \"Right-moving: [Span(t₁) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t₁), h + s(T-t₁)]\"\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nIn the text: \"Left-moving: Span(t₁) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t₁), τ - s(T-t₁)]\"\n\n\"Right-moving: [Span(t₁) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t₁), h + s(T-t₁)]\"\n\nFor left-moving, it's [h, τ] with h and τ, and for right-moving, it's [τ, h], which might imply that for left-moving, h is left end, τ is right end? But if it's moving left, the left end should be decreasing.\n\nPerhaps head is always the front when moving.\n\nBut for left-moving, front is left, so head is left position; for right-moving, front is right, so head is right position.\n\nIn the notation:\n\nFor left-moving: head at h, tail at τ, and span [h, τ] with h and τ, and since moving left, h decreases.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving: span(t₁) = [τ, h], and it moves to [τ + s dt, h + s dt], so if τ and h, and [τ, h], with τ < h since it's moving right? The text says \"head is at h, tail is at τ\" for both, but for right-moving, span is given as [τ, h], which might mean τ is left, h is right.\n\nI think it's inconsistent in the description.\n\nLet's see the car state given.\n\nFor example, freeway 1: cars (-24, -35, right, 4), (12, 1, right, 4), (48, 37, right, 4)\n\nBut for right-moving, it says \"Span(t₁) = [τ, h]\" so for this car, τ is the first number, h is the second? But in the tuple it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed)? No.\n\nLook at the table: \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nIn the row: \"(-24, -35, right, 4)\" so this is (head, tail, dir, speed) = (-24, -35, right, 4)\n\nBut for right-moving, the span is defined as [τ, h] in the update rule.\n\nFor this car, head = -24, tail = -35, dir = right, speed=4.\n\nSince it's right-moving, span(t₁) = [τ, h] = [-35, -24]\n\nThen at turn T, span(T) = [τ + s(T-t₁), h + s(T-t₁)] = [-35 + 4(T-34), -24 + 4(T-34)]\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, it would be [h, τ] and move to [h - s dt, τ - s dt]\n\nBut in this case, all cars are right-moving except possibly others, but in the given state, all are right-moving? Let's check.\n\nFreeway 1 to 8, all cars have direction \"right\", so all are right-moving.\n\nFreeway 1: all right\n\nFreeway 2: all right\n\nFreeway 3: all right\n\nFreeway 4: all right\n\nFreeway 5: all right\n\nFreeway 6: one car, right\n\nFreeway 7: right\n\nFreeway 8: right\n\nSo all cars are right-moving. So for all, we use the right-moving update.\n\nFor a right-moving car with head h, tail τ, speed s at turn t₁, span at T is [τ + s(T-t₁), h + s(T-t₁)]\n\nAnd since it's moving right, and [τ, h] with τ < h, I assume? In the example, for freeway 1, first car: head=-24, tail=-35, so τ=-35, h=-24, so τ < h, since -35 < -24, so span is [τ, h] = [-35, -24], which is from left to right.\n\nSimilarly, second car: (12,1,right,4), head=12, tail=1, so τ=1, h=12, span [1,12]\n\nThird car: (48,37,right,4), head=48, tail=37, τ=37, h=48, span [37,48]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow collision: at turn T, if player is on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there is a car where 0 is in its span at turn T.\n\nPlayer is on freeway y_t at turn t, meaning when we compute position at turn t, we are on y_t for collision check at that turn.\n\nAlso, note that when we move, at turn T, we are on y_T, and we decide action a_T which affects y_{T+1}, but for collision at T, it's based on y_T and cars at T.\n\nThe note says: if you move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you are not on y_{T+1} at turn T, so only check cars on y_T at turn T.\n\nSimilarly, at turn T, you are on y_T, so check cars on freeway y_T at turn T.\n\nNow, t₁ = 34, player at (0,1), so at turn 34, y=1, so we need to check if at turn 34, on freeway 1, is there a car where 0 in span?\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway and for each turn around now, when 0 is covered by a car.\n\nSince we start at turn 34, and we want to go to y=9, we need to move up through y=2,3,4,5,6,7,8 to 9.\n\nEach step we can go up, down, or stay.\n\nBut since we need to minimize turns, we want to go up as much as possible, but avoid being on a freeway when a car covers 0 at that turn.\n\nAlso, we can stay on a freeway or move away.\n\nNow, let's compute for each freeway k, the times when 0 is covered by any car on that freeway.\n\nFor a given freeway, we have multiple cars, each with their span over time.\n\nFor collision on freeway k at turn T, if for any car on k, 0 is in [τ + s(T-t₁), h + s(T-t₁)] for that car.\n\nt₁=34 is the current turn, so dt = T - 34.\n\nLet δt = T - 34, so at time δt after t₁.\n\nFor each car, span at T is [τ + s δt, h + s δt]\n\n0 is in this interval if τ + s δt ≤ 0 ≤ h + s δt\n\nSince for right-moving, τ ≤ h, so the interval is [τ + s δt, h + s δt], and 0 is in it if τ + s δt ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ h + s δt.\n\nWhich is equivalent to:\n\nτ + s δt ≤ 0 and h + s δt ≥ 0\n\nSince s > 0, we can solve for δt.\n\nFirst inequality: τ + s δt ≤ 0 ⇒ s δt ≤ -τ ⇒ δt ≤ -τ / s\n\nSecond inequality: h + s δt ≥ 0 ⇒ s δt ≥ -h ⇒ δt ≥ -h / s\n\nSo for each car, 0 is covered when max( -h/s , something) to min.\n\nδt must satisfy:\n\nδt ≥ ceil( -h / s ) ? Since δt integer, but inequalities are real, but since positions are integers, and time discrete, we need to find integer δt where the inequalities hold.\n\nτ + s δt ≤ 0 and h + s δt ≥ 0\n\nSince s δt is multiple of s, but s may not be integer? Speeds are given, all integers: 4,4,4,6,6,6,12,12,12,3,24,24, all integers, so s integer.\n\nPositions integers, so let's work with integers.\n\nFor a car, 0 covered when τ + s δt ≤ 0 ≤ h + s δt\n\nWhich is equivalent to:\n\n- h - s δt ≤ 0 ≤ -τ - s δt? Better not.\n\nFrom τ + s δt ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ h + s δt\n\nSo s δt ≤ -τ and s δt ≥ -h\n\nSince s > 0, δt ≤ floor(-τ / s) ? Let's see.\n\ns δt ≤ -τ, since s δt and -τ integers, s δt ≤ -τ\n\nSimilarly, s δt ≥ -h\n\nNow, since s δt ≥ -h and s δt ≤ -τ\n\nBut -h and -τ, since τ and h, with τ ≤ h, so -h ≤ -τ, so s δt ≥ -h and s δt ≤ -τ\n\nSo the range for s δt is from -h to -τ inclusive? s δt from -h to -τ.\n\nThen δt must satisfy that s δt is integer between -h and -τ inclusive.\n\nThen for each possible s δt, δt can be found.\n\nBut since s is given, we can find the range of δt.\n\nFor each car, the values of δt where 0 in span:\n\nδt min such that s δt ≥ -h, so δt ≥ ceil( -h / s )\n\nδt max such that s δt ≤ -τ, so δt ≤ floor( -τ / s )\n\nThen δt from ceil( -h / s ) to floor( -τ / s ) inclusive.\n\nThen for each freeway, since multiple cars, we need the union over cars of these intervals for when 0 is covered.\n\nThen for that freeway, collision occurs at T if δt in that set for some car.\n\nOtherwise, no collision.\n\nNow, player is safe on freeway k at turn T if no car on k covers 0 at T.\n\nWe start at turn 34, δt=0, y=1.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nEach action U increases y by 1, D decreases by 1, S keeps same.\n\ny must stay in 0-9.\n\nSince we start at 1 and go to 9, we need net +8, so minimum 8 turns if no delays.\n\nBut with cars, we may need to wait or detour.\n\nBut detour down might not help since we have to come back, so probably best to go up directly but wait when necessary.\n\nFirst, let's compute for each freeway k=1 to 8, the times when it is occupied, i.e., 0 covered.\n\nt₁=34, δt = T - 34.\n\nLet me make a table for each k.\n\nFirst, freeway 1 (y=1):\n\nCars: \n1.

Similarly, staying might be needed sometimes.\n\nSince min steps is 8, let's see if we can reach in 8 turns by T=41.\n\nT=34 to T=41 is 7 turns, but we start at T=34, after action at T=34, we go to T=35, etc.\n\nAfter H turns, at turn T=34 + H, position is after H actions.\n\nLet's clarify.\n\nAt turn T, we perform action a_T, which sets y_{T+1}.\n\nBut for collision, at turn T, we are at y_T, and we check based on that.\n\nAt turn T, position is y_T, and we choose a_T to set y_{T+1}.\n\nThen at turn T+1, we are at y_{T+1}, and so on.\n\nStart: at turn 34, we are at y_34 = 1.\n\nWe choose a_34, which sets y_35.\n\nThen at turn 35, we are at y_35, choose a_35, sets y_36, etc.\n\nWe want y_{34 + H} = 9 for some H, and min H.\n\nSince we start at y=1, to reach y=9, we need to increase by 8, so with no waiting, H=8, we reach at turn 42, y_42=9.\n\nBut we need to avoid being on a row when it is occupied.\n\nNow, let's list the occupation:\n\nRow y=1: occupied at T=40,41,42\n\nBut at T=40,41,42, if we are on y=1, collision, but we might not be on y=1 at those times if we move up.\n\nSimilarly, y=2 same occupied times.\n\ny=3 occupied T=39,40\n\ny=4 occupied T=39,40\n\ny=5 occupied T=34 and T=37\n\nAt T=34, occupied, but we are not on y=5.\n\ny=6 occupied T=49-52, far.\n\ny=7 occupied T=36\n\ny=8 occupied T=36\n\ny=9 safe.\n\nNow, we need to be careful around T=36 and T=37.\n\nAlso later at T=39-42 for lower rows.\n\nFirst, since we start at T=34, y=1, safe.\n\nNow, we need to go up.\n\nBut y=7 and y=8 are occupied at T=36, so we must not be on y=7 or y=8 at T=36.\n\nSimilarly, y=5 occupied at T=37.\n\nNow, let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, at T=34: y=1, safe. We can choose to go up, stay, or down.\n\nIf we go up, to y=2 at T=35.\n\nIf stay, y=1 at T=35.\n\nIf down, y=0 at T=35.\n\ny=0 is safe, but then we need to come back, so it takes extra turns, so probably not good.\n\nSimilarly, staying might be needed if we can't go up.\n\nBut at T=34, we can go up.\n\nAssume we go up at T=34: a_34 = U, then y_35 = 2.\n\nNow at T=35: y=2, which is safe? y=2 occupied only at T=40-42, T=35 is earlier, so safe.\n\nNow, at T=35, we can choose action.\n\nWe can go up to y=3, or stay, or down to y=1.\n\nIf go up, y_36=3.\n\nBut at T=36, y=3 is not occupied? y=3 occupied at T=39,40, not at 36.\n\nT=36 is before.\n\nSimilarly, y=4 occupied at 39,40.\n\nBut at T=36, we need to worry about y=7 and y=8 occupied.\n\nBut if we are on y=3 at T=36, that's fine.\n\nBut we need to reach higher.\n\nLet's see the critical points.\n\nAt T=36, we must not be on y=7 or y=8.\n\nSimilarly, at T=37, we must not be on y=5.\n\nAlso, at T=39,40, y=3 and y=4 occupied, so we must not be on them at those times.\n\nSimilarly, at T=40,41,42, y=1 and y=2 occupied.\n\nNow, since we start low, we might want to move up quickly to avoid the lower row occupations later.\n\nBut the upper rows have earlier occupations.\n\nLet's list the turns we need to avoid each row:\n\n- y=1: avoid at T=40,41,42\n\n- y=2: avoid at T=40,41,42\n\n- y=3: avoid at T=39,40\n\n- y=4: avoid at T=39,40\n\n- y=5: avoid at T=34 and T=37\n\n- y=6: avoid at T=49-52 (far, might not reach by then or past)\n\n- y=7: avoid at T=36\n\n- y=8: avoid at T=36\n\n- y=9: always safe\n\nNow, we need to be at y=9 by some turn.\n\nMinimal H: if no issues, from y=1 to y=9 in 8 moves, at turn 42, y=9.\n\nBut at turn 42, if we are at y=9, safe, but during the path, we might be on occupied rows.\n\nSpecifically, at turn 42, if we are on y=1 or 2, occupied, but we want to be on y=9.\n\nSimilarly, at earlier turns.\n\nNow, let's try to go directly up.\n\nStart T=34, y=1, safe.\n\na_34: U, so y_35=2\n\nT=35, y=2, safe (since occupied at 40-42, not now)\n\na_35: U, y_36=3\n\nT=36, y=3, safe? y=3 occupied at 39,40, not 36, so safe.\n\nBut at T=36, y=7 and y=8 occupied, but we are on y=3, fine.\n\nNow a_35 action sets y_36, so at T=36, position y_36.\n\nNow we need to choose a_36.\n\nIf we go up, y_37=4\n\nT=37, y=4, which is occupied? y=4 occupied at T=39,40, not 37, so safe.\n\ny=4 not occupied at T=37.\n\nBut at T=37, y=5 is occupied.\n\nBut we are on y=4, not y=5, so fine.\n\nNow a_36: U, y_37=4\n\nThen T=37, y=4, safe.\n\na_37: U, y_38=5\n\nNow T=38, y=5, is it occupied? y=5 occupied at T=34 and T=37.\n\nT=34 past, T=37 just passed, T=38 not occupied? Earlier we have for y=5, covered at T=34 and T=37.\n\nAt T=38, not covered, so safe.\n\na_37: U to y_38=5\n\nT=38, y=5, safe.\n\na_38: U, y_39=6\n\nT=39, y=6, is it occupied? y=6 occupied at T=49-52, not 39, so safe.\n\nBut at T=39, y=3 and y=4 are occupied, but we are on y=6, fine.\n\na_38 action to y_39=6\n\nT=39, y=6, safe.\n\na_39: U, y_40=7\n\nT=40, y=7, is it occupied? y=7 occupied only at T=36, not at 40, so safe.\n\nBut at T=40, y=1 and y=2 occupied, but we are on y=7.\n\nAlso y=3 and y=4 occupied at T=40.\n\nBut y=7 safe.\n\na_39: U to y_40=7\n\nT=40, y=7, safe.\n\na_40: U, y_41=8\n\nT=41, y=8, occupied? y=8 occupied only at T=36, not at 41, so safe.\n\na_41: U, y_42=9\n\nT=42, y=9, safe.\n\nNow, we reached y=9 at turn 42.\n\nBut turn 42 is after 8 actions: from T=34 to T=41 actions, then at T=42 position.\n\nActions at T=34 to T=41, 8 actions, y from 1 to 9.\n\nNow, check if any collision during this path.\n\nAt each turn, position and if occupied.\n\nT=34: y=1, not occupied, safe\n\nT=35: y=2, not occupied (only at 40-42), safe\n\nT=36: y=3, not occupied (only at 39,40), T=36 not occupied, safe\n\nT=37: y=4, not occupied (only at 39,40), safe\n\nT=38: y=5, not occupied (only at 34,37), T=38 not, safe\n\nT=39: y=6, not occupied (only at 49-52), safe\n\nT=40: y=7, not occupied (only at 36), safe\n\nT=41: y=8, not occupied (only at 36), safe\n\nT=42: y=9, safe\n\nIn the actions, at T=40, we are at y=7, which is safe, and we go to y=8 at T=41.\n\nAt T=41, y=8, safe.\n\nThen to y=9 at T=42.\n\nSeems all safe.\n\nBut earlier I thought y=1 and y=2 occupied at T=40,41,42, but we are not on them.\n\nSimilarly, y=3 and y=4 occupied at T=39,40, but at T=39 we are on y=6, T=40 on y=7.\n\nNo issue.\n\nBut is there a problem at T=36? At T=36, we were on y=3, which is fine.\n\nIn this path, we didn't encounter any occupied row at the time we were on it.\n\nBut let me confirm the actions:\n\nStart T=34, y=1: a_34 = U, so y_35=2\n\nT=35, y=2: a_35 = U, y_36=3\n\nT=36, y=3: a_36 = U, y_37=4\n\nT=37, y=4: a_37 = U, y_38=5\n\nT=38, y=5: a_38 = U, y_39=6\n\nT=39, y=6: a_39 = U, y_40=7\n\nT=40, y=7: a_40 = U, y_41=8\n\nT=41, y=8: a_41 = U, y_42=9\n\nT=42, y=9.\n\nAll positions during turns 34 to 42 are safe as above.\n\nBut at T=37, we have y=4, which is not occupied, and y=5 is occupied at T=37, but we are not on y=5.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nBut is this minimal? H=8 actions, from T=34 to T=41, reached at T=42.\n\nCan we do in fewer?\n\nFor example, if we start at y=1, to y=9, we need at least 8 up moves, so 8 actions are minimum, since each U increases by 1, and S or D would require more moves to compensate, so 8 is minimum possible.\n\nIn this case, we achieved in 8 actions without any waiting, so it should be minimal.\n\nBut let me double-check if at any point we are on occupied row.\n\nFor example, at T=34, y=1, not occupied.\n\nBut y=5 is occupied at T=34, but we are on y=1.\n\nSimilarly, at T=36, y=7 and y=8 occupied, but we are on y=3.\n\nAt T=37, y=5 occupied, but we are on y=4.\n\nAll good.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 5, at T=34, it is occupied, but since we are not on it, no collision.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo this sequence seems to work.\n\nBut the problem is to output the actions from t₁, which is 34.\n\nSo actions: a_{34} to a_{41}, all U.\n\nBut in the answer format, it should be for turns starting from t₁.\n\nNow, H=8, actions for t=34 to 34+7=41? t from t_1 to t_1 + H-1.\n\nH is the number of turns, so actions from t= t_1 to t_1 + H-1.\n\nIn this case, H=8, actions at t=34 to 41, reaching at t=42.\n\nNow, but let me make sure about the car on y=6, which is occupied at T=49-52, but we are there at T=39, fine.\n\nAlso, is there any other constraint?\n\nIn the sequence, we go from y=1 to y=2 at T=35, but at T=35, y=2 is safe, yes.\n\nPerhaps we can go faster, but we can't, since min 8 moves.\n\nUnless we start from higher, but we start at y=1.\n\nAnother thing: at T=36, if we were on y=7 or 8, but we are not.\n\nIn this path, we are on y=3 at T=36.\n\nBut let me see if we can be higher earlier.\n\nFor example, if at T=34, we go up, y=2 at 35.\n\nThen at T=35, if we go up, y=3 at 36, as above.\n\nIf at T=35, we go up again, but we can only go one step per turn.\n\nPerhaps stay or something, but not necessary.\n\nAnother point: at T=37, if we were on y=5, it would be occupied, but we are on y=4.\n\nIn our sequence, at T=37, we are on y=4, and go to y=5 at T=38.\n\nAt T=37, y=5 is occupied, but we are not on it.\n\nNow, but the collision is only when on the freeway at that turn with 0 covered.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nBut let me confirm the position at each turn.\n\nTurn T | position y_T | occupied? | safe?\n\nT=34: y=1, not occ, safe\n\nT=35: y=2, not occ (occ at 40-42), safe\n\nT=36: y=3, not occ (occ at 39,40), safe\n\nT=37: y=4, not occ (occ at 39,40), safe\n\nT=38: y=5, not occ (occ at 34,37), T=38 not occ, safe\n\nT=39: y=6, not occ (occ at 49-52), safe\n\nT=40: y=7, not occ (occ at 36), safe\n\nT=41: y=8, not occ (occ at 36), safe\n\nT=42: y=9, safe\n\nAll good.\n\nActions: all U from T=34 to T=41.\n\nBut T=41 action is U to y=9 at T=42.\n\nNow, the sequence should be:\n\nTurn 34: U\n\nTurn 35: U\n\nTurn 36: U\n\nTurn 37: U\n\nTurn 38: U\n\nTurn 39: U\n\nTurn 40: U\n\nTurn 41: U\n\nH=8.\n\nBut is there a way with H=7? That would require net +8 with only 7 actions, but each action can increase at most 1, so impossible to gain 8 in 7 actions. So H=8 is minimum.\n\nThus, this should be the answer.\n\nBut in the car list, for freeway 3, it has cars: (-30,-41,right,6), (48,37,right,6), (12,1,right,6)\n\nIn my earlier, I computed y=3 occupied at T=39,40.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nPerhaps I should output.\n\nBut the answer format.\n\nBut in the sequence, we used only U, no S or D.\n\nBut just to be thorough, suppose we try to stay somewhere, but that would increase H, so worse.\n\nOr go down, worse.\n\nSo this seems optimal.\n\nBut at T=34, if we stay, y=1, then later we might be affected by the occupation at T=40-42 for y=1, but since we go up early, we avoid it.\n\nSimilarly, in this path, we are not on any occupied row.\n\nAnother thing: the note says if you move to y_{T+1} != y_T at turn T, you are not on y_{T+1} at turn T, which we already considered.\n\nFor example, at turn T, we are on y_T, and move to y_{T+1}, but collision check only at y_T for turn T.\n\nI think we are fine.\n\nSo minimal H is 8, with all U actions.\n\nBut let me write the actions.\n\nFor turn t_1 =34, actions a_{34} to a_{41}.\n\na_{34}: U\n\na_{35}: U\n\na_{36}: U\n\na_{37}: U\n\na_{38}: U\n\na_{39}: U\n\na_{40}: U\n\na_{41}: U\n\nIn the answer format.\n\nBut the output should be in a box.\n\nPerhaps I need to list them.\n\nSince H=8, sequence from t=34 to t=34+7=41.\n\nt from t_1 to t_1 + H-1.\n\nYes.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 34: U\n\nTurn 35: U\n\nTurn 36: U\n\nTurn 37: U\n\nTurn 38: U\n\nTurn 39: U\n\nTurn 40: U\n\nTurn 41: U\n\nAnd that's it.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 5, at T=34, it is occupied, but we are not on it, so ok.\n\nSimilarly, at T=36, y=7 and 8 occupied, but we are on y=3.\n\nAll good.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 1)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 34\\) is 8. The sequence of actions consists entirely of \"U\" (up) moves, increasing the player's \\(y\\)-coordinate by 1 each turn, resulting in \\(y = 9\\) at turn 42.\n\n### Verification of Collision Avoidance:\n- At each turn, the player's position is checked against the car spans on the corresponding freeway to ensure no collision occurs.\n- The car spans and their movements are computed based on the initial state at turn 34 and the right-moving update rule: \\(\\text{Span}(T) = [\\tau + s(T-34), h + s(T-34)]\\), where \\(\\tau\\) is the tail, \\(h\\) is the head, and \\(s\\) is the speed.\n- The freeways are occupied at specific turns (i.e., 0 is in the car span) as follows:\n  - \\(y=1\\): occupied at turns 40, 41, 42\n  - \\(y=2\\): occupied at turns 40, 41, 42\n  - \\(y=3\\): occupied at turns 39, 40\n  - \\(y=4\\): occupied at turns 39, 40\n  - \\(y=5\\): occupied at turns 34, 37\n  - \\(y=6\\): occupied at turns 49 to 52\n  - \\(y=7\\): occupied at turn 36\n  - \\(y=8\\): occupied at turn 36\n  - \\(y=9\\): never occupied\n\nThe player's path and actions are as follows:\n- **Turn 34**: Action \\(U\\), position \\((0, 1)\\) → safe (not on \\(y=5\\) at turn 34).\n- **Turn 35**: Action \\(U\\), position \\((0, 2)\\) → safe (not occupied).\n- **Turn 36**: Action \\(U\\), position \\((0, 3)\\) → safe (not on \\(y=7\\) or \\(y=8\\) at turn 36).\n- **Turn 37**: Action \\(U\\), position \\((0, 4)\\) → safe (not on \\(y=5\\) at turn 37).\n- **Turn 38**: Action \\(U\\), position \\((0, 5)\\) → safe (not occupied).\n- **Turn 39**: Action \\(U\\), position \\((0, 6)\\) → safe (not occupied).\n- **Turn 40**: Action \\(U\\), position \\((0, 7)\\) → safe (not on \\(y=1\\), \\(y=2\\), \\(y=3\\), or \\(y=4\\) at turn 40).\n- **Turn 41**: Action \\(U\\), position \\((0, 8)\\) → safe (not occupied).\n\nAt turn 42, the player reaches \\((0, 9)\\), which is safe.\n\nThis sequence achieves the goal in the minimum \\(H = 8\\) turns, as fewer turns are impossible due to the net required increase of 8 in \\(y\\)-coordinate (each action changes \\(y\\) by at most 1).\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 34: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 35: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 36: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 37: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 38: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 39: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 40: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 41: \\text{ U} \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,3) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t=36, and I have the positions and movements of the cars.\n\nFirst, I should understand how the cars move. They're on different freeways, and each has a head, tail, direction, and speed. The direction determines if they're left or right-moving, but in this case, all are right-moving, since direction is \"right\" for all.\n\nLet me list out the cars for each freeway:\n\n- Freeway 1: three cars: (-16,-27,right,4), (20,9,right,4), (56,45,right,4)\n\n- Freeway 2: same as freeway 1? (-16,-27,right,4), (20,9,right,4), (56,45,right,4) — identical to freeway 1.\n\n- Freeway 3: (-18,-29,right,6), (60,49,right,6), (24,13,right,6)\n\n- Freeway 4: same as freeway 3? (-18,-29,right,6), (60,49,right,6), (24,13,right,6) — yes.\n\n- Freeway 5: (24,13,right,12), (-12,-23,right,12), (-48,-59,right,12)\n\n- Freeway 6: only one car: (-39,-50,right,3)\n\n- Freeway 7: (0,-23,right,24)\n\n- Freeway 8: (0,-23,right,24) — same as freeway 7.\n\nFreeways 1 and 2 are identical, 3 and 4 identical, 7 and 8 identical. Freeway 5 has three cars, freeway 6 has one.\n\nThe player starts at y=3, and needs to reach y=9. Since y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars there, I think. Freeways are from y=1 to y=8, so y=0 and y=9 should be free of cars.\n\nThe goal is to reach (0,9), which is the top row, I assume.\n\nNow, the car positions are given at turn t=36. For any future turn T, the car spans are updated based on speed and direction.\n\nSince all cars are right-moving, for a car with head h, tail τ at t=36, at turn T, the span is [τ + s(T-36), h + s(T-36)] because it's moving right.\n\nIn the car update, for right-moving: Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] where t1=36.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, it would be [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)], but here all are right-moving.\n\nNow, collision occurs at turn T only if the player is on a freeway y, and for that freeway, at turn T, 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway. That is, if the x-coordinate 0 is covered by a car on the row y at time T.\n\nAlso, note that when the player moves, at turn T, if they move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T, they are not on y_{T+1} at turn T, so they don't collide with cars on y_{T+1} at time T, even if 0 is in span at T, as long as they move away before being on that row at that time.\n\nThe collision condition: at turn T, if y_T is between 1 and 8, and 0 is in the span of any car on freeway y_T at time T.\n\nIf the player changes row at turn T, meaning they are on row y_T at time T, then they move to y_{T+1} at time T+1, I think.\n\nThe player position update: at turn t, position is (0, y_t), and action a_t determines y_{t+1}.\n\nAt time t, after action, y_{t+1} is set.\n\nBut when we say \"at turn T\", I think it refers to the state at the beginning of the turn or after action? I need to clarify the timing.\n\nLet me read the collision part carefully.\n\n\"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd y_T is the player's position at turn T.\n\nAlso, \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nThis means that at turn T, you are on row y_T, and you might collide only with cars on row y_T at time T.\n\nIf you move to a different row, you are on that new row at time T+1.\n\nSo, for collision check at time T, it depends on y_T and the cars on row y_T at time T.\n\nNow, to reach y=9 from y=3, I need to go up, so actions U or S, but S keeps me in place, which might be useful for waiting.\n\nSince I need to minimize turns, I probably want to go up as fast as possible, but I have to avoid the cars.\n\ny=9 is safe, so once I reach there, I'm done.\n\ny=0 is also safe, but I'm starting from y=3, and need to go to y=9, so going down might not help, except to avoid cars, but since cars are on freeways 1-8, and y=0 is safe, I could go down to y=0 to wait, but that might increase turns, so probably not optimal since I need to go up eventually.\n\nSimilarly, y=9 is the target.\n\nThe minimal number of turns to go from y=3 to y=9 is 6 turns if I go up every time, but I might have to wait or avoid.\n\nBut with cars, it might take more.\n\nFirst, I need to find out for each freeway, when is it safe to be on that row at time T, meaning that 0 is not in any car's span on that row at that time.\n\nSince the cars move, the safety is time-dependent.\n\nAlso, for each freeway, I have multiple cars, so I need to find when all cars on that row do not cover x=0 at that time.\n\nFor a given freeway and time T, I need that for all cars on that freeway, 0 is not in [τ + s(T-36), h + s(T-36)] for right-moving cars.\n\nSince head and tail, for right-moving, if h > τ, then the span is [τ, h], and it moves right, so at time T, the left end is τ + s(T-36), right end is h + s(T-36).\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, but all are right-moving here.\n\nIn the data, for example, freeway 1, first car: head -16, tail -27? Head should be the front, so for right-moving, head is larger than tail? Let's see the values.\n\nFor freeway 1, first car: (-16,-27,right,4). Now, -16 > -27, so since it's right-moving, head is at -16, tail at -27, so the car is from x=-27 to x=-16, I think? But typically, tail is behind, so for right-moving, tail is left, head is right.\n\nIn the span definition: for right-moving, span at t1 is [τ, h] with τ < h, I assume.\n\nIn the update: for right-moving, Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, Span(t1) = [h, τ] with h > τ, I think, but in this case all right.\n\nSo for freeway 1, car1: at t=36, span [ -27, -16 ] since τ=-27, h=-16? But it says (head, tail) = (-16, -27), and direction right.\n\nIn the car state: \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nSo for this car, h = -16, τ = -27, d=right, s=4.\n\nSince right-moving, the span is from τ to h, so from -27 to -16.\n\nAt time T, span is [τ + s(T-36), h + s(T-36)] = [-27 + 4(T-36), -16 + 4(T-36)]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, 0 is in the span if τ + s(T-36) ≤ 0 ≤ h + s(T-36)\n\nSince it's a closed interval, I assume.\n\nSimilarly for other cars.\n\nFor a car to cover x=0 at time T, we need left end ≤ 0 ≤ right end, so τ + s(T-36) ≤ 0 ≤ h + s(T-36)\n\nNow, for each car, I can find the time intervals when it covers x=0.\n\nThen for a freeway, since multiple cars, I need times when no car covers x=0.\n\nThat is, for all cars on that freeway, 0 is not covered.\n\nSo let's do this for each freeway.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: three cars.\n\nCar1: h=-16, τ=-27, s=4\n\nCover when: -27 + 4(T-36) ≤ 0 ≤ -16 + 4(T-36)\n\nSolve inequalities.\n\nLeft: -27 + 4(T-36) ≤ 0 => 4(T-36) ≤ 27 => T-36 ≤ 27/4 = 6.75 => T ≤ 36 + 6.75 = 42.75\n\nSince T integer, T ≤ 42\n\nRight: 0 ≤ -16 + 4(T-36) => 16 ≤ 4(T-36) => 4 ≤ T-36 => T ≥ 40\n\nSo for car1, covers 0 when T from 40 to 42 inclusive? T ≥ 40 and T ≤ 42, so T=40,41,42\n\nNow car2: (20,9,right,4) h=20, τ=9, s=4\n\nCover: 9 + 4(T-36) ≤ 0 ≤ 20 + 4(T-36)\n\nLeft: 9 + 4(T-36) ≤ 0 => 4(T-36) ≤ -9 => T-36 ≤ -9/4 = -2.25 => T ≤ 33.75, so T ≤ 33\n\nRight: 0 ≤ 20 + 4(T-36) => -20 ≤ 4(T-36) => -5 ≤ T-36 => T ≥ 31\n\nBut T ≤ 33 and T ≥ 31, so T=31,32,33\n\nBut T=36 is current, and we're looking for future T, so for T>36, car2 covers only up to T=33, which is before now, so for T>36, car2 never covers 0 because at T=36, left end is 9 + 4(0) =9, which is >0, and moving right, so always >0 for T>36.\n\nAt T=36, span [9 +0, 20+0] = [9,20], which is all positive, so for T>36, it moves right, left end increases, so 0 is never covered for T>=36? T=36: left=9>0, so 0 not covered. For T>36, left end larger, so never covered.\n\nSimilarly, car3: (56,45,right,4) h=56, τ=45, s=4\n\nCover: 45 + 4(T-36) ≤ 0 ≤ 56 + 4(T-36)\n\nLeft: 45 + 4(T-36) ≤ 0 => 4(T-36) ≤ -45 => T-36 ≤ -11.25 => T ≤ 24.75, so T<=24, way before.\n\nRight: 0 <= 56 + 4(T-36) always true for T>=36 since 56>0 and increasing.\n\nBut left inequality not satisfied for T>=36, so car3 never covers 0 for T>=36.\n\nSo for freeway 1, only car1 can cover 0 at T=40,41,42.\n\nThus, freeway 1 is unsafe at T=40,41,42, and safe otherwise for T>36.\n\nT=40,41,42 unsafe.\n\nFreeway 2 is identical to freeway 1, so same: unsafe at 40,41,42.\n\nNow freeway 3: cars (-18,-29,right,6), (60,49,right,6), (24,13,right,6)\n\nCar1: h=-18, τ=-29, s=6\n\nCover: -29 + 6(T-36) <= 0 <= -18 + 6(T-36)\n\nLeft: -29 + 6(T-36) <=0 => 6(T-36) <=29 => T-36 <= 29/6 ≈4.833 => T<=40.833, so T<=40\n\nRight: 0 <= -18 + 6(T-36) => 18 <= 6(T-36) => 3 <= T-36 => T>=39\n\nSo T>=39 and T<=40, so T=39,40\n\nCar2: (60,49,right,6) h=60, τ=49, s=6\n\nCover: 49 + 6(T-36) <=0 <=60 + 6(T-36)\n\nLeft: 49 + 6(T-36) <=0 => 6(T-36) <= -49 => T-36 <= -49/6 ≈ -8.166 => T <= 27.833, too early.\n\nSimilarly, car3: (24,13,right,6) h=24, τ=13, s=6\n\nCover: 13 + 6(T-36) <=0 <=24 + 6(T-36)\n\nLeft: 13 + 6(T-36) <=0 => 6(T-36) <= -13 => T-36 <= -13/6 ≈ -2.166 => T <= 33.833, so T<=33\n\nRight: 0 <=24 + 6(T-36) always true, but left not for T>33, so only before.\n\nThus for freeway 3, only car1 covers at T=39,40.\n\nUnsafe at 39,40.\n\nFreeway 4 same as 3, unsafe at 39,40.\n\nNow freeway 5: cars (24,13,right,12), (-12,-23,right,12), (-48,-59,right,12)\n\nCar1: h=24, τ=13, s=12\n\nCover: 13 + 12(T-36) <=0 <=24 + 12(T-36)\n\nLeft: 13 + 12(T-36) <=0 => 12(T-36) <= -13 => T-36 <= -13/12 ≈ -1.083 => T <= 34.917, so T<=34\n\nBefore now.\n\nCar2: (-12,-23,right,12) h=-12, τ=-23, s=12\n\nCover: -23 + 12(T-36) <=0 <= -12 + 12(T-36)\n\nLeft: -23 + 12(T-36) <=0 => 12(T-36) <=23 => T-36 <= 23/12 ≈1.916 => T<=37.916, so T<=37\n\nRight: 0 <= -12 + 12(T-36) => 12 <= 12(T-36) => 1 <= T-36 => T>=37\n\nSo T>=37 and T<=37.916, so T=37\n\nCar3: (-48,-59,right,12) h=-48, τ=-59, s=12\n\nCover: -59 + 12(T-36) <=0 <= -48 + 12(T-36)\n\nLeft: -59 + 12(T-36) <=0 => 12(T-36) <=59 => T-36 <= 59/12 ≈4.916 => T<=40.916, so T<=40\n\nRight: 0 <= -48 + 12(T-36) => 48 <= 12(T-36) => 4 <= T-36 => T>=40\n\nSo T>=40 and T<=40.916, so T=40\n\nThus for freeway 5, car2 covers at T=37, car3 at T=40, so unsafe at T=37 and T=40.\n\nCar1 not for T>36.\n\nNow freeway 6: only one car: (-39,-50,right,3)\n\nh=-39, τ=-50, s=3\n\nCover: -50 + 3(T-36) <=0 <= -39 + 3(T-36)\n\nLeft: -50 + 3(T-36) <=0 => 3(T-36) <=50 => T-36 <= 50/3 ≈16.666 => T<=52.666, so T<=52\n\nRight: 0 <= -39 + 3(T-36) => 39 <= 3(T-36) => 13 <= T-36 => T>=49\n\nSo T>=49 and T<=52.666, so T=49,50,51,52\n\nThus unsafe at T=49,50,51,52.\n\nNow freeway 7: (0,-23,right,24)\n\nh=0, τ=-23, s=24\n\nCover: -23 + 24(T-36) <=0 <= 0 + 24(T-36)\n\nSince head is 0, and it's right-moving.\n\nSpan at T: [τ + s(T-36), h + s(T-36)] = [-23 + 24(T-36), 0 + 24(T-36)]\n\nCover 0 when: -23 + 24(T-36) <= 0 <= 24(T-36)\n\nLeft inequality: -23 + 24(T-36) <=0 => 24(T-36) <=23 => T-36 <= 23/24 ≈ 0.958 => T <= 36.958, so T<=36\n\nRight inequality: 0 <= 24(T-36) => T-36 >=0 => T>=36\n\nSo at T=36, it covers 0?

Car1: τ=-29, h=-18, s=6, at T=36, span [-29 +0, -18+0] = [-29,-18], all negative, so 0 not covered.\n\nCar2: [49,60], positive.\n\nCar3: [13,24], positive.\n\nSo at T=36, no car covers x=0 on freeway 3, so player is safe at start.\n\nBut for freeway 7, at T=36, car: [ -23 +0, 0 +0] = [-23,0], so 0 is covered, so if player were on y=7 at T=36, it would collide, but player is at y=3, so ok.\n\nBack to freeway 7 cover times.\n\nAt T=36, cover as above: T=36 only, since T<=36 and T>=36.\n\nFor T>36, left: -23 +24(T-36) <=0? At T=37, left= -23 +24(1) = -23+24=1 >0, so left=1>0, and right=24>0, so 0 not covered.\n\nSimilarly for T>36, left end increases, so never covered again.\n\nSo freeway 7 unsafe only at T=36.\n\nSimilarly freeway 8 same, unsafe only at T=36.\n\nNow, summarize the unsafe times for each freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: unsafe at T=40,41,42\n\nFreeway 2: same, 40,41,42\n\nFreeway 3: unsafe at 39,40\n\nFreeway 4: same, 39,40\n\nFreeway 5: unsafe at T=37 and T=40\n\nFreeway 6: unsafe at 49,50,51,52\n\nFreeway 7: unsafe only at T=36 (but T=36 is now, and player not there)\n\nFreeway 8: same, T=36\n\nNow, player starts at y=3 at t=36.\n\nWe need to get to y=9 as quickly as possible.\n\ny=9 is safe, no freeway.\n\nThe path: from y=3, we can go to y=4,5,6,7,8, but need to avoid being on unsafe rows at unsafe times.\n\nSince we can stay or move up or down, but moving down might not help.\n\nLet me list the times when each row is unsafe.\n\nRow 1: unsafe at T=40,41,42\n\nRow 2: same as row1, 40,41,42\n\nRow 3: unsafe at 39,40\n\nRow 4: same as row3, 39,40\n\nRow 5: unsafe at 37 and 40\n\nRow 6: unsafe at 49,50,51,52\n\nRow 7: unsafe only at T=36, but T=36 is past for future? For T>36, row7 is safe, since only unsafe at T=36.\n\nSimilarly row8: safe for T>36.\n\nNow, row6 is unsafe from 49 to 52, which is later.\n\nPlayer at t=36, y=3.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nThe minimal steps: from y=3 to y=9, need at least 6 steps if all up, but may need to wait.\n\nSince rows have unsafe times, we need to plan the sequence.\n\nPossible actions: U, D, S.\n\nBut D to go down might be useful to avoid, but since we need to go up, probably not efficient.\n\nS to stay might be needed to wait.\n\nNow, let me consider times starting from t=36.\n\nAt t=36, player at y=3.\n\nWe need to choose actions for t=36,37,38,... until reach y=9.\n\nThe position y_t changes based on action.\n\ny_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, with Δy based on action.\n\nFor collision at time t, depends on y_t and the row at that time.\n\nWe start at t=36, y=3.\n\nAt t=36, row3 is safe, as we saw earlier.\n\nNow, we need to go to y=9.\n\nLet me see the unsafe periods.\n\nFirst, row3 is unsafe at t=39 and 40.\n\nSimilarly, row4 at 39,40.\n\nRow5 at 37 and 40.\n\nRow1 and 2 at 40,41,42.\n\nRow6 at 49-52, which is far.\n\nRow7 and 8 safe after t=36.\n\nSince row5 is unsafe at t=37, which is soon.\n\nt=37 is the next turn.\n\nAt t=36, we are at y=3.\n\nWe can choose action at t=36.\n\nIf we go up, to y=4 at t=37.\n\nBut at t=37, y=4, row4 is unsafe at t=39,40, not at t=37? Let's see row4 unsafe times.\n\nRow4 same as row3, unsafe at 39,40.\n\nAt t=37, row4 should be safe, since unsafe only at 39,40.\n\nSimilarly, row5 unsafe at 37 and 40.\n\nSo at t=37, if we are on row5, it is unsafe.\n\nBut if we are on row4, it should be safe at t=37.\n\nSimilarly, at t=36, y=3, safe.\n\nOptions at t=36:\n\nAction U: move up to y=4 at t=37.\n\nThen at t=37, position y=4, which is row4.\n\nRow4 at t=37: is it safe? From above, row4 unsafe only at 39,40, so at t=37, safe.\n\nAction D: move down to y=2 at t=37.\n\nBut y=2 is row2, unsafe at 40,41,42, not at 37, so safe, but going down might not help.\n\nAction S: stay at y=3, then at t=37, y=3, row3 safe at t=37? Row3 unsafe at 39,40, so at t=37 safe.\n\nNow, since we want to go up, probably U or S, but S delays.\n\nSo better to go up if possible.\n\nAt t=36, if we do U, to y=4 at t=37.\n\nThen at t=37, we are at y=4.\n\nNow, we need to choose action for t=37.\n\nWe can go U to y=5, or D to y=3, or S at y=4.\n\nIf we go U to y=5 at t=38.\n\nBut row5 is unsafe at t=37 and t=40.\n\nAt t=37, row5 is unsafe, but at t=37, if we go to y=5, we are on y=5 at time t=38? Let's clarify.\n\nAt turn t, we are at position y_t.\n\nAfter action a_t, we move to y_{t+1}, which is the position for turn t+1.\n\nAt time t, collision depends on y_t and the row at time t.\n\nFor example, at t=37, position y_{37}, which was set by action at t=36.\n\nAt t=37, we are on row y_{37}, and we check if 0 covered at time t=37.\n\nThen we choose action a_{37}, which sets y_{38}, and so on.\n\nBack to t=37.\n\nIf at t=36 we did U, then at t=37, y=4 (row4).\n\nAt t=37, row4 is safe (unsafe only 39,40).\n\nNow, at t=37, we choose action.\n\nIf we do U, then y_{38} =5, so at t=38, we are at y=5.\n\nAt t=38, row5: is it safe? Row5 unsafe at t=37 and t=40.\n\nt=37 is before, t=40 later, so at t=38, row5 should be safe? Unsafe times: t=37 and t=40, so at t=38, not unsafe, so safe.\n\nThen we can be at y=5 at t=38.\n\nThen, at t=38, we can go U to y=6 at t=39.\n\nBut at t=39, y=6, row6.\n\nRow6 unsafe at 49-52, not at 39, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, we can go to y=7 at t=40, but at t=40, y=7, row7.\n\nRow7 unsafe only at t=36, so for t=40, safe.\n\nThen to y=8 at t=41, row8 safe.\n\nThen to y=9 at t=42.\n\nBut at t=40, if we are at y=7, safe.\n\nBut row5 is unsafe at t=40, but we are not there.\n\nIn this path: let's list the turns.\n\nt=36: start y=3, safe. Action U, so y_{37}=4\n\nt=37: y=4, safe (row4 safe at t=37). Action U, so y_{38}=5\n\nt=38: y=5, safe (row5 safe at t=38, since unsafe only 37 and 40). Action U, so y_{39}=6\n\nt=39: y=6, row6 safe at t=39 (unsafe 49-52). Action U, so y_{40}=7\n\nt=40: y=7, row7 safe for t>36. Action U, so y_{41}=8\n\nt=41: y=8, row8 safe. Action U, so y_{42}=9\n\nt=42: y=9, reached.\n\nNow, at t=42, y=9, which is the target, and since y=9 is not a freeway, no collision, so we are done.\n\nH=7 turns? From t=36 to t=42, that's 7 actions? Let's see the sequence.\n\nActions from t=36 to t=41, for H=6 actions? Define H as number of actions.\n\nThe sequence is from t=0 to H-1 relative to start, but here start is t1=36.\n\nIn the problem: sequence {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, and at turn t1 + H -1, position is (0,9).\n\nIn this case, at turn t=42, y=9.\n\nt1 + H -1 = 42, t1=36, so 36 + H -1 =42, thus H-1=6, H=7.\n\nActions: t=36 to t=42? The actions are at times t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nSequence: actions at t=36,37,38,39,40,41,42? But at t=42, after action, position at t=43? I'm confused.\n\nClarify the timing.\n\nTurn t: at the beginning, position y_t.\n\nPerform action a_t, which sets y_{t+1}.\n\nThen at time t, we check collision based on y_t and the row at time t.\n\nAfter action, y_{t+1} is the position for the next turn.\n\nWhen we reach y_{t} =9 at some turn t, we stop, and H is such that after H actions, we are at (0,9).\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t=36 to t=36+H-1, and at turn t=36+H-1, y=9.\n\nIn my earlier path:\n\nAt t=36: y=3, after action U, y_{37}=4\n\nt=37: y=4, after U, y_{38}=5\n\nt=38: y=5, after U, y_{39}=6\n\nt=39: y=6, after U, y_{40}=7\n\nt=40: y=7, after U, y_{41}=8\n\nt=41: y=8, after U, y_{42}=9\n\nNow, at turn t=42, position is y=9, so we have reached (0,9) at turn t=42.\n\nThe actions were at t=36 to t=41, that's 6 actions.\n\nH actions: from t=36 to t=36+H-1, we perform actions, and at turn t=36+H-1, position is (0,9).\n\nHere, at turn t=42, position is (0,9), so t=36+H-1=42, so H-1=6, H=7? 36 + H -1 =42, so H-1=6, H=7.\n\nBut actions at t=36,37,38,39,40,41: that's 6 actions, and after 6 actions, at turn t=42, y=9.\n\nt=36: action a_{36}, sets y_{37}\n\nAfter a_{36}, y_{37} set, but position at t=37 is y_{37}.\n\nSimilarly, after k actions, position at t=36+k.\n\nStart: t=36, position y_{36}=3\n\nAfter first action a_{36}, position at t=37 is y_{37}\n\nAfter second action a_{37}, position at t=38 is y_{38}\n\n...\n\nAfter H actions, position at t=36+H is y_{36+H}\n\nBut we want position at turn t to be (0,9) for some t, which should be after H actions, so at turn t=36+H, position y_{36+H} =9.\n\nIn the problem: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H -1\"\n\nt1 + H -1, position (0,9).\n\nt1=36.\n\nSo at turn 36 + H -1, y=9.\n\nIn terms of actions: after H actions, we are at turn 36 + H.\n\nBut the turn when we are at y=9 is t = 36 + H -1.\n\nFor example, after 0 actions, at t=36, y=3.\n\nAfter 1 action, at t=37, y_{37}\n\n...\n\nAfter H actions, at t=36+H, y_{36+H}\n\nBut we want at turn T, y_T=9, with T = 36 + H -1.\n\nSo y_{36 + H -1} =9.\n\nAfter H-1 actions, position at t=36 + (H-1) = 35 + H? Let's index properly.\n\nSet k = number of actions taken.\n\nAfter k actions, position at t = 36 + k.\n\nWe want position at some turn T to be (0,9), and T = t1 + H -1 = 36 + H -1.\n\nSo y_{36 + H -1} =9.\n\nNow, after how many actions? At turn 36 + H -1, y=9.\n\nThis position is set by the action at t=36 + H -2, I think.\n\nBut for the sequence, actions from t=36 to t=36 + H -1, H actions in total? Let's see the range.\n\nThe actions are a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, so times t1 to t1 + H -1.\n\nThen at turn t1 + H -1, position is (0,9).\n\nIn my earlier path:\n\nWe want at turn T=42, y=9.\n\nT = 36 + H -1 =42, so 36 + H -1=42, H-1=6, H=7.\n\nSo actions at t=36,37,38,39,40,41,42? But at t=42, we perform an action to set y_{43}, but we want y at t=42 to be 9.\n\nInconsistency.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t is given, then we perform action a_t to set y_{t+1}.\n\nAt turn t, we have y_t, and we check collision based on y_t at time t.\n\nThen we perform a_t, which sets y_{t+1}.\n\nWe reach when y_t =9 for some t.\n\nIn this case, for t=42, y_42=9.\n\ny_42 is set by the action at t=41.\n\nThe actions are performed from t=36 to t=41 to set y_37 to y_42.\n\ny_37 set by a_36, y_38 by a_37, ..., y_42 by a_41.\n\nThen at turn t=42, y_42=9.\n\nThe sequence of actions is a_{36} to a_{41}, 6 actions.\n\nH is the number of actions, from t=0 to H-1 relative, but absolute times t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nt1=36, actions at t=36 to t=36+H-1.\n\nAfter H actions, position at t=36+H.\n\nBut we want position at t=36+H-1 to be 9? Let's read the problem.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H -1\"\n\nSo at turn t1 + H -1, position is (0,9).\n\nFor example, if H=1, actions at t1, then at turn t1 +1 -1 = t1, position should be (0,9), but position at t1 is given, not set by action.\n\nt1 + H -1 is the turn when we are at (0,9).\n\ny_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nThis is set by the action at t1 + H -2.\n\nThe actions are from t=t1 to t=t1 + H -1.\n\nFor H=1: actions at t1 (t=0 to 0), one action, then at turn t1 +1 -1 = t1, position should be (0,9). But at t1, position is given, so if it is not (0,9), we need to move, so H cannot be 1 if not already there.\n\nIn this case, at t=36, y=3, not 9, so H>0.\n\nAfter H actions, we have performed actions at t=36,37,..., up to t=36+H-1, and after that, at turn t=36+H, position is set, but we want at turn t=36+H-1 to be (0,9).\n\nThe position at turn t is y_t.\n\nAfter action at t-1, y_t is set.\n\nFor turn t, y_t is the position at that turn.\n\nAction at t sets y_{t+1}.\n\nTo have y_T =9 for T = t1 + H -1.\n\nIn my path, I want y_42=9.\n\nT=42 = t1 + H -1 = 36 + H -1, so 36 + H -1 =42, H-1=6, H=7.\n\nThen actions at t=36 to t=36+6=42? t from 0 to H-1=6, so t=36 to 41? Let's list:\n\nt relative: t=0,1,2,...,H-1\n\nabsolute time: t1 + t for t=0 to H-1\n\naction at time t1 + t\n\nThen at turn t1 + H -1, position is (0,9).\n\nFor H=7, actions at t=36+0=36 to t=36+6=42? t from 0 to 6, absolute times 36 to 42.\n\nAction at t=36,37,38,39,40,41,42.\n\nThen at turn t1 + H -1 =36+7-1=42, position y_42 should be 9.\n\nBut action at t=42 sets y_{43}, so y_42 is set by action at t=41.\n\nIf we have action at t=42, it sets y_43, which is for turn 43.\n\nBut we want y_42=9.\n\nSo for turn t=42 to have y_42=9, it must be set by action at t=41.\n\nThe last action is at t=41, setting y_42.\n\nThen actions are from t=36 to t=41 for H=6 actions.\n\nThen at turn t1 + H -1 =36 +6 -1=41, position should be (0,9)? 36+6-1=41.\n\nBut in my path, at t=41, I have y=8, not 9.\n\nIn my sequence:\n\nAt t=36: y=3, action U, set y=4\n\nt=37: y=4, action U, set y=5\n\nt=38: y=5, action U, set y=6\n\nt=39: y=6, action U, set y=7\n\nt=40: y=7, action U, set y=8\n\nt=41: y=8, action U, set y=9\n\nThen at turn t=42, y=9.\n\nSo to have y_42=9, we need the action at t=41 to set it.\n\nThe turn when we reach is t=42.\n\nt=42 = t1 + H -1 =36 + H -1, so 36 + H -1=42, H-1=6, H=7.\n\nBut with H=7 actions: actions at t=36 to t=42.\n\nAction at t=42 sets y_43, but we don't care, since we already at y_42=9 at turn 42.\n\nIn the sequence, for t=42, we might not need to perform action if we are already at 9, but in the action sequence, we include actions until we reach.\n\nIn the problem, the actions are to move to reach, so when we are at y_t=9, we don't need action, but in the sequence, it might be included or not.\n\nLet's see the answer format: it shows actions for turns, so probably we list actions until the last one that sets the position to 9.\n\nIn my case, to reach at turn 42, with y_42=9, which is set by action at t=41.\n\nSo actions from t=36 to t=41.\n\nH=6 actions.\n\nThen at turn t1 + H -1 =36 +6 -1=41, position should be (0,9), but at t=41, y=8, not 9.\n\nContradiction.\n\nI think I have a confusion.\n\nDefine T_reach as the turn when y_t =9.\n\nThen T_reach = t1 + H -1.\n\nH is the number of actions taken from t1 to T_reach -1 or something.\n\nStart at t=t1, y_t1 given.\n\nAfter first action at t=t1, set y_{t1+1}\n\nAfter second action at t=t1+1, set y_{t1+2}\n\n...\n\nAfter k-th action at t=t1+k-1, set y_{t1+k}\n\nThen when y_{t1+k} =9 for some k, we have taken k actions.\n\nThen T_reach = t1 + k\n\nNow, T_reach = t1 + k = t1 + H -1? From the problem.\n\nt1 + H -1 = T_reach\n\nBut T_reach = t1 + k, so t1 + H -1 = t1 + k, thus H-1 = k, so H = k+1\n\nH is the number of actions, but k actions taken, T_reach = t1 + k\n\nThen t1 + H -1 = t1 + k, so H-1 = k, H = k+1\n\nBut k is number of actions, so H = number of actions +1? Messy.\n\nPerhaps H is defined as the number of turns from start to reach, including start or not.\n\nThe problem says: \"the minimal number of turns H\" and \"reach at turn t1 + H -1\"\n\nAlso, \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}_{t=0}^{H-1}\"\n\nFor example, if we start at t1 and already at (0,9), then H=1, actions from t=0 to H-1=0, so one action at t=t1, but if we are already there, no action needed, but the sequence might be empty, but H=1 might imply one turn.\n\nBut in this case, not there.\n\nTo avoid confusion, let's think of the turn when we reach.\n\nIn my path, we reach at t=42 with y=9.\n\nt=42 = t1 + H -1 =36 + H -1, so 36 + H -1 =42, H-1=6, H=7.\n\nThen actions at t=36 to t=42 for t from 0 to 6.\n\nBut at t=42, we perform an action, but if we are at y=9 at t=42, we might do S or something, but in the sequence, when we reach, we can stop the action.\n\nBut in the action list, for t=42, if we are at y=9, we can do S, but it's unnecessary.\n\nIn this case, in my sequence, at t=41, we are at y=8, action U to set y=9 at t=42.\n\nThen at t=42, we are at y=9, so for the action at t=42, we don't need to do anything, but we can include a_S or omit.\n\nBut the sequence should include the actions to reach.\n\nPerhaps it's better to list actions only until the last move.\n\nBut the problem says the sequence for t=0 to H-1, so H actions.\n\nFor H=7, actions at t=36 to t=42, but at t=42, action might be S or U, but since already at 9, S.\n\nBut in my case, at t=42, y=9, so if we include action at t=42, it should be S to stay, but it's redundant.\n\nTo save actions, we can have the last action at t=41 setting y=9.\n\nThen H=6 actions, from t=36 to t=41.\n\nThen at turn t=42, y=9, which is t1 + H =36+6=42, but the problem says at turn t1 + H -1.\n\nt1 + H -1 =36+6-1=41, but at t=41, y=8, not 9.\n\nSo not matching.\n\nI think there's a miswording or standard way.\n\nPerhaps \"turn\" includes the starting point.\n\nI think for simplicity, in this context, since we start at t=36, and after H actions, we reach at turn t=36+H.\n\nThen at turn t=36+H, y=9.\n\nThen H is the number of actions.\n\nIn the problem, it says \"at turn t1 + H -1\", so it must be that.\n\nTo resolve, let's assume that at turn t1, we are not at 9, so we need at least one action.\n\nAfter H actions, we are at turn t1+H, position y_{t1+H} =9.\n\nBut the problem says at turn t1 + H -1, position (0,9).\n\nSo for example, if we can reach in one action: at t1, y not 9, action a, set y_{t1+1}=9, then at turn t1+1, y=9, so T_reach = t1+1 = t1 + H -1, so H-1=1, H=2.\n\nH=2 actions? But we only took one action.\n\nInconsistency.\n\nPerhaps H is the number of turns elapsed, not actions.\n\nLet's read: \"the minimal number of turns H\" and \"reach at turn t1 + H -1\"\n\nAlso, \"a sequence of actions of length H\"\n\nIn the sequence, {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, so H actions.\n\nThen at turn t1 + H -1, position (0,9).\n\nFor this to make sense, at turn t1 + H -1, y is set, and it is 9.\n\nBut y at turn t is set by action at t-1.\n\nFor turn t1 + H -1, y is set by action at t1 + H -2.\n\nThe actions are from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nAction at t1 sets y_{t1+1}, action at t1+1 sets y_{t1+2}, ..., action at t1+H-1 sets y_{t1+H}.\n\nThen at turn t1+H, y is set.\n\nBut we want at turn t1 + H -1, y=9.\n\nSo for turn t1 + H -1, y is set by action at t1 + H -2.\n\nSo to have y_{t1+H-1} =9, it must be that the action at t1+H-2 sets it.\n\nThen the action at t1+H-1 sets y_{t1+H}, which is after, so for the sequence, we may not need the last action if we reach early, but in this case, since we list H actions, we include it.\n\nFor example, in my path, to have y_42=9, it is set by action at t=41.\n\nSo actions at t=36 to t=41 set y_37 to y_42.\n\nAt turn t=42, y=9.\n\nNow, t=42 = t1 + H -1 =36 + H -1, so 36 + H -1=42, H-1=6, H=7.\n\nThen for H=7, we need to list actions at t=36 to t=42.\n\nAt t=42, since we are at y=9, we do action S to stay, so y_43=9, but we don't care.\n\nOr, we can have the last action at t=41 setting y=9, and no action at t=42.\n\nBut the sequence requires H actions from t=0 to H-1 relative.\n\nI think for the sake of this problem, we can proceed with the path and list the actions until the move to 9.\n\nIn the answer, we list the actions for the turns.\n\nIn my initial path, with 6 actions: a36=U, a37=U, a38=U, a39=U, a40=U, a41=U, then at t=42, y=9.\n\nFor the sequence, actions at t=36 to t=41.\n\nH=6.\n\nThen at turn t1 + H -1 =36+6-1=41, position should be (0,9), but at t=41, position is y=8, not 9, so it must be that at t=41, y=9, but in this case it's not.\n\nTo have at t=41 y=9, we need to reach earlier.\n\nBut from y=3, minimum 6 steps to y=9, so at best t=42 with 6 actions.\n\nAt t=36 y=3, after 6 actions, at t=42 y=9.\n\nSo t=42 = 36 +6, so T_reach=42.\n\nt1 + H -1 must be 42, so 36 + H -1=42, H-1=6, H=7.\n\nSo H=7, with actions at t=36 to t=42.\n\nAt t=42, since y=9, we do S.\n\nIn the sequence, it's fine.\n\nSimilarly, in the path, we have actions including the stay at the end.\n\nBut for collision, at t=42, y=9, no issue.\n\nSo in my path, with actions: t=36: U to y=4\nt=37: U to y=5\nt=38: U to y=6\nt=39: U to y=7\nt=40: U to y=8\nt=41: U to y=9\nt=42: S to stay at y=9, but since already at 9, S is fine.\n\nBut at t=42, we are at y=9, so action S keeps it.\n\nNow, in this sequence, we need to check for collision at each turn.\n\nIn this path:\n\nt=36: y=3, row3 safe as established.\n\nt=37: y=4, row4 at t=37: unsafe at 39,40, so t=37 safe.\n\nt=38: y=5, row5 at t=38: unsafe at 37 and 40, so at t=38, not unsafe, safe.\n\nt=39: y=6, row6 at t=39: unsafe at 49-52, not 39, safe.\n\nt=40: y=7, row7 at t=40: unsafe only at t=36, so for t=40 safe.\n\nt=41: y=8, row8 safe for t>36.\n\nt=42: y=9, no freeway, safe.\n\nAll safe, and we reach at t=42.\n\nH=7 turns? Number of turns from start to reach is 7 turns? Turns t=36 to t=42, 7 turns, but with 7 actions.\n\nH=7.\n\nBut is there a faster way?\n\nFrom y=3 to y=9, minimum 6 steps, but with cars, can we do in 6 actions to reach at t=41?\n\nFor example, if we start at t=36 y=3, after 5 actions, at t=41 y=8, then action U at t=41 to set y=9 at t=42, so still t=42.\n\nTo reach at t=41, we need y_41=9, which means from y=3 at t=36, in 5 actions, but 5 actions can at best reach y=8 if all U: y37=4, y38=5, y39=6, y40=7, y41=8, so y41=8, not 9. To reach y=9 at t=41, we need to start from higher or something, but at t=36 y=3, impossible to reach y=9 before t=42 with actions. Since each action changes y by at most 1, from 3 to 9, 6 steps, so minimum reach at t=42.\n\nThus H=7 is the minimal possible in terms of steps, but with cars, we might need to wait, increasing H.\n\nIn this case, with the path above, we can do it in H=7 without waiting.\n\nBut in the path, at t=38, y=5, which is safe at t=38.\n\nBut row5 is unsafe at t=37 and t=40.\n\nAt t=37, in the path, we are at y=4, not y=5.\n\nAt t=40, we are at y=7, not y=5.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nSimilarly, other rows.\n\nBut at t=39, row3 and row4 are unsafe, but we are at y=6, not on them.\n\nSo all good.\n\nBut is there a problem at t=40?\n\nAt t=40, we are at y=7, row7 safe.\n\nBut row1,2,5 are unsafe at t=40.\n\nRow1 and2 unsafe at 40,41,42; row5 at 37 and 40.\n\nBut we are not on them.\n\nSo the path seems fine.\n\nBut let's confirm the car positions at critical points.\n\nFor example, at t=40, row1: car1 covers, as we had T=40.\n\nBut we are not on row1.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nIn the sequence, we have to list actions.\n\nBut in the answer, for t=36 to t=42.\n\nBut H=7.\n\nBut perhaps we can start with S or something to avoid, but not necessary.\n\nAnother thing: at t=39, row3 and row4 are unsafe, so if we were on them, bad, but we are on row6.\n\nIn this path, no issue.\n\nBut let's see if we can reach faster, but we cannot.\n\nPerhaps go down or stay to miss the unsafe times.\n\nFor example, if we stay at y=3 at t=36, then at t=37, y=3.\n\nBut row3 unsafe at t=39,40, so at t=37, safe.\n\nBut then we delay, so reach later.\n\nSimilarly, not better.\n\nGo down to y=2, but row2 unsafe at 40,41,42, and we need to go up, so more steps.\n\nNot good.\n\nSo the direct up path works.\n\nBut in the path, at t=38, y=5, t=38, row5 safe.\n\nBut row5 unsafe at t=37, which we avoided by not being there at t=37.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, but we have row6 unsafe later, but we pass at t=39, safe.\n\nNow, but in the sequence, we have 7 actions: U,U,U,U,U,U,S for t=36 to 42.\n\nBut at t=42, action S is redundant but fine.\n\nTo have only 6 actions, but we need to reach at t=41, impossible.\n\nPerhaps with different path.\n\nFor example, if we go up faster, but cannot.\n\nOr, from y=3, at t=36, if we do U to y=4.\n\nThen at t=37, instead of U, we could do U to y=5, but at t=37, if we go to y=5, at t=38 position y=5.\n\nBut at t=37, when we are at y=4, if we do U, we set y_{38}=5, so at t=38, we are at y=5.\n\nThen at t=38, y=5, safe, as before.\n\nIf at t=37 we do S, we stay at y=4, then at t=38, y=4, row4 unsafe at t=39,40, not at t=38, safe, but then we delay.\n\nWorse.\n\nSimilarly, other options.\n\nSo the direct path is best.\n\nBut in the car list, freeway 6 has a car, but we pass at t=39, safe.\n\nNow, but let's list the actions for the sequence.\n\nCurrent turn t1=36, position (0,3)\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 36: U  (to y=4 at t=37)\n\nIn the sequence, action at t sets y_{t+1}.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 36: action U, so y_{37}=4\n\nTurn 37: action U, y_{38}=5\n\nTurn 38: action U, y_{39}=6\n\nTurn 39: action U, y_{40}=7\n\nTurn 40: action U, y_{41}=8\n\nTurn 41: action U, y_{42}=9\n\nNow, at turn 42, y=9, reached.\n\nFor the action sequence, we need to include up to when?\n\nWith 6 actions, at t=36 to 41.\n\nThen at turn t1 + H -1 =36 + H -1.\n\nSet to 42, so 36 + H -1=42, H-1=6, H=7.\n\nSo we need H=7 actions.\n\nThus, at turn 42, we need an action.\n\nSince at t=42, position y=9, we do S.\n\nSo action at t=42: S\n\nThen y_{43}=9, but not necessary.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nTurn 36: U\n\nTurn 37: U\n\nTurn 38: U\n\nTurn 39: U\n\nTurn 40: U\n\nTurn 41: U\n\nTurn 42: S\n\nAnd at turn 42, position (0,9).\n\nNow, collision: at each turn, as above, all safe.\n\nBut let's confirm t=40.\n\nAt t=40, y=7, row7.\n\nRow7: at t=40, car position: since only unsafe at t=36, for t=40, span: [ -23 + 24(40-36), 0 + 24(40-36) ] = [ -23 + 24*4, 0 + 96 ] = [ -23 + 96, 96 ] = [73, 96], not covering 0.\n\nSimilarly, other rows not an issue.\n\nSo all good.\n\nBut is there a shorter H? H=7, but since min steps 6, and we have 6 moves, but with the turn count, H=7.\n\nPerhaps we can reach in fewer turns by being at y=9 earlier, but impossible from y=3.\n\nSo I think this is minimal.\n\nBut in the beginning, I thought about row5 unsafe at t=37, but in the path we are not there at t=37.\n\nAt t=37, we are at y=4.\n\nNow, another thing: freeway 7 and 8 have cars, but at t=36, they cover, but we are not there.\n\nIn the path, at t=40, we go to y=7, safe.\n\nBut let's see the answer format.\n\nPerhaps I should write the sequence.\n\nBut the problem is to output the actions.\n\nIn the car list, for freeway 6, it has a car that covers later, but we pass early.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's see if at t=39, on row6.\n\nFreeway 6: car (-39,-50,right,3)\n\nAt t=39, span: τ + s(T-36) = -50 + 3(39-36) = -50 + 9 = -41\n\nh + s(T-36) = -39 + 9 = -30\n\nSo span [-41, -30], all negative, 0 not covered, safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nThus, the sequence should be U for all from t=36 to t=41, and S at t=42.\n\nBut since we reach at t=42, and action at t=42 is S, it's fine.\n\nTo have H smaller, but impossible.\n\nPerhaps we can go directly without the last S.\n\nBut with H=6 actions, from t=36 to 41, then at turn t1+H-1=36+6-1=41, position should be (0,9), but it is (0,8), not 9.\n\nSo must include the last action.\n\nThus, minimal H=7.\n\nBut let's see if we can reach at an earlier turn.\n\nFor example, if we start from higher, but no.\n\nOr, by going down and up, but that would take more turns.\n\nFor example, go to y=0, then up, but y=0 to y=9, 9 steps, worse.\n\nSo not better.\n\nThus, the sequence is as above.\n\nNow, for the answer.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 36: U\n\nTurn 37: U\n\nTurn 38: U\n\nTurn 39: U\n\nTurn 40: U\n\nTurn 41: U\n\nTurn 42: S\n\nBut t=42 is turn t1 + 6, since t from 0 to 6 for H=7.\n\nt1=36.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let's write it.\n\nThe sequence should be in the format.\n\nAlso, in the car state, freeway 5 has cars, but we didn't go there at unsafe time.\n\nAnother point: at t=40, multiple rows unsafe, but we are on y=7 safe.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nPerhaps we can have a path that avoids the unsafe times with same H.\n\nBut not necessary.\n\nSo I think this is the way.\n</think>\nTo reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 3) at turn \\(t_1 = 36\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 7. The sequence of actions is designed to move upward directly, leveraging the safe times for each freeway based on car movements. The car positions and their unsafe times have been analyzed to ensure no collision occurs at any turn.\n\nThe unsafe times for each freeway are:\n- Freeway 1: unsafe at turns 40, 41, 42\n- Freeway 2: unsafe at turns 40, 41, 42\n- Freeway 3: unsafe at turns 39, 40\n- Freeway 4: unsafe at turns 39, 40\n- Freeway 5: unsafe at turns 37, 40\n- Freeway 6: unsafe at turns 49, 50, 51, 52\n- Freeway 7: unsafe only at turn 36\n- Freeway 8: unsafe only at turn 36\n\nThe player starts at \\(y = 3\\) (freeway 3) at turn 36, which is safe since freeway 3 is unsafe only at turns 39 and 40. The sequence moves up each turn, reaching \\(y = 9\\) at turn 42.

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to get from position (0,5) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t₁ = 38.\n\nThe player moves vertically: up (U) increases y by 1, down (D) decreases y by 1, or stay (S) keeps y the same. y must stay between 0 and 9 inclusive.\n\nCars are on each freeway from y=1 to y=8. For each freeway, there are cars defined by their head, tail, direction, and speed. I need to avoid being on a freeway when there's a car that covers position x=0 at that turn.\n\nThe collision rule says: collision occurs at turn T only if 0 is in the span of any car on the freeway y_T. And importantly, when I move to a new y, I'm not on that new freeway until the next turn. So if I move from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T I'm still on y, and at turn T+1 I'm on y+1. So I only check for collision on the freeway I'm currently on at that turn.\n\nMy goal is to reach y=9, which is not a freeway, so no cars there. I start at y=5, so I need to go up to y=9.\n\ny=9 is safe since there are no cars above y=8.\n\nI need to minimize the number of turns H, so I should try to go up as fast as possible, but I have to avoid the cars on y=6,7,8 when I'm on them.\n\nSince I'm going up, and cars are moving horizontally, I need to check for each freeway whether at the turn when I'm on it, there is a car covering x=0.\n\nThe car positions change over time based on their speed and direction.\n\nLet me denote the current turn as t=38.\n\nI need to find a sequence of actions for t=38, 39, 40, etc., until I reach y=9.\n\nSince I start at y=5, and I want to go to y=9, I need to increase y by 4, so minimum turns if no cars would be 4 turns: U,U,U,U to go from 5 to 6,7,8,9. But I have to check if I can do that without colliding.\n\ny=5 is a freeway? Freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=5 has cars, and I'm starting on y=5 at turn 38.\n\nAt turn 38, I'm on y=5, so I need to check if there is a car on y=5 that has 0 in its span at turn 38.\n\nSimilarly for other turns when I'm on other freeways.\n\nFirst, let's look at the car states at turn 38.\n\nFor freeway 5:\n\nCars: (48, 37, right, 12), (12, 1, right, 12), (-24, -35, right, 12)\n\nDirection is right, so for right-moving cars, span is [τ, h] with τ < h, and it moves right, so at time T, span is [τ + s(T-t₁), h + s(T-t₁)]\n\nt₁ is 38.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but here all cars seem to be right-moving.\n\nIn the table, for freeway 1 and 2, it says \"right\", but the heads and tails: for example, freeway 1: (-8, -19, right, 4)\n\n-8 and -19, with direction right. Since it's right-moving, head should be greater than tail? But -8 > -19, so head is -8, tail is -19? That seems odd because usually tail is behind, but with negative coordinates, it might be fine.\n\nLet's clarify the span.\n\nFor right-moving car: at time t, span is [τ, h] where τ is tail, h is head, and τ ≤ h. Then at time T, position is [τ + s(T-t), h + s(T-t)]\n\nSimilarly for left-moving: [h, τ] with h ≥ τ, and moves left, so [h - s(T-t), τ - s(T-t)]\n\nIn the data, for freeway 1: (-8, -19, right, 4)\n\nSince direction is right, and head is -8, tail is -19, which is less than head, so at time t, span is [tail, head] = [-19, -8]\n\nThen at time T, span is [-19 + 4(T-38), -8 + 4(T-38)]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut I need to check when 0 is in this span for a given T and freeway.\n\nAlso, for collision, it's when I am on that freeway at turn T, and 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway at that turn.\n\nNow, for freeway 5 at turn 38: cars are (48, 37, right, 12), (12, 1, right, 12), (-24, -35, right, 12)\n\nFirst car: head=48, tail=37, right, speed=12. So at T=38, span is [37, 48]? Tail=37, head=48, so [37,48] at T=38.\n\nBut I need x=0, which is not in [37,48], so safe for this car.\n\nSecond car: (12, 1, right, 12), tail=1, head=12, so [1,12] at T=38. 0 not in [1,12], safe.\n\nThird car: (-24, -35, right, 12), tail=-35, head=-24, so [-35,-24] at T=38. 0 not in this, since -35 to -24, all negative, 0 not included.\n\nSo at turn 38, on y=5, no car covers x=0, so it's safe to be here now.\n\nBut I need to move from here.\n\nNow, I want to go up to y=6, then 7, etc.\n\nBut I have to be careful when I move to each level.\n\nSince I can stay or move down, but since I want to go up, moving down might not be efficient, so I should only consider U or S, but S might be needed to wait for a car to pass.\n\nBut to minimize turns, I should avoid S if possible.\n\nMinimum H is 4, so let's see if I can go U,U,U,U in four turns.\n\nStart at t=38, y=5.\n\nAction at t=38: let's say U, then at t=39, y=6.\n\nBut at t=39, I am on y=6, so I need to check if on y=6 at t=39, is there a car covering x=0.\n\nSimilarly, if I go U at t=39, to y=7 at t=40, and so on.\n\nFirst, freeway y=6 at time t.\n\nFreeway 6: only one car: (-33, -44, right, 3)\n\nDirection right, tail=-44, head=-33? Tail is -44, head is -33? In the table: \"(-33, -44, right, 3)\" so I think it's head, tail, direction, speed.\n\nIn the car state: \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nSo for freeway 6: head=-33, tail=-44, direction=right, speed=3.\n\nSince direction right, tail should be less than head? -44 < -33, yes, so at time T, span is [tail + s(T-t₁), head + s(T-t₁)] = [-44 + 3(T-38), -33 + 3(T-38)]\n\nt₁=38.\n\nNow, at turn T, I need 0 in this interval for collision.\n\nSo set -44 + 3(T-38) ≤ 0 ≤ -33 + 3(T-38)\n\nLet Δt = T-38, so time since turn 38.\n\nThen -44 + 3Δt ≤ 0 ≤ -33 + 3Δt\n\nFirst inequality: -44 + 3Δt ≤ 0 => 3Δt ≤ 44 => Δt ≤ 44/3 ≈ 14.666, so Δt ≤ 14 since integer.\n\nSecond inequality: 0 ≤ -33 + 3Δt => 33 ≤ 3Δt => Δt ≥ 11.\n\nSo for Δt from 11 to 14 inclusive, 0 is in the span.\n\nThat is, at turns T = 38 + 11 = 49 to 38 + 14 = 52, the car covers x=0 on freeway 6.\n\nBut at other times, not.\n\nNow, for my plan: I am at turn 38 on y=5.\n\nIf I go U at t=38, I move to y=6 at t=39.\n\nAt t=39, I am on y=6, so need to check for collision at t=39.\n\nt=39, Δt = 39-38 =1.\n\nIs 1 between 11 and 14? No, 1 < 11, so not covered, so safe at t=39.\n\nSimilarly, if I go U again at t=39, to y=7 at t=40.\n\nBut first, let's list the turns.\n\nt=38: y=5, no collision as we saw.\n\nAction U: then t=39: y=6\n\nAt t=39, on y=6: Δt=1, not in [11,14], so safe.\n\nThen action at t=39: say U, then t=40: y=7\n\nNow, need to check y=7 at t=40.\n\nFreeway 7: cars: (48, 25, right, 24)\n\nOnly one car? Head=48, tail=25, right, speed=24.\n\nAt T, span: [25 + 24(T-38), 48 + 24(T-38)]\n\nSet 25 + 24Δt ≤ 0 ≤ 48 + 24Δt? No, 25 + 24Δt is always positive for Δt ≥0, since 25>0, so 0 cannot be ≤ 25 + 24Δt, which is at least 25.\n\n25 + 24Δt ≥ 25 >0 for all Δt, so 0 is never in the interval because the left end is at least 25.\n\nSimilarly, right end is larger.\n\nSo for freeway 7, since the car is at [25,48] at t=38 and moving right, it only covers positive x, so x=0 is never covered. So no collision possible on y=7 at any time.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8: same car? (48, 25, right, 24), identical to y=7.\n\nIn table: freeway 7: (48, 25, right, 24)\n\nFreeway 8: (48, 25, right, 24), same thing.\n\nSo similarly, for y=8, no car ever covers x=0, since min x is 25 at t=38 and increasing.\n\nSo y=7 and y=8 are always safe.\n\nNow back to y=6: we have a car that covers x=0 from t=49 to 52, but not at t=39.\n\nNow, at t=39, y=6 is safe.\n\nThen at t=40, if I go to y=7, which is safe as we said.\n\nThen I can go to y=8 at t=41, and to y=9 at t=42.\n\ny=9 is not a freeway, so no collision.\n\nBut I need to reach y=9, so at turn when y=9, that should be the last turn.\n\nSequence:\n\nt=38: y=5, action U\n\nt=39: y=6, action U\n\nt=40: y=7, action U\n\nt=41: y=8, action U\n\nt=42: y=9, done.\n\nNow, check for collision at each point:\n\n- t=38: on y=5, we checked no collision at t=38.\n\n- t=39: on y=6, Δt=1, car not at x=0, safe.\n\n- t=40: on y=7, no car covers x=0, safe.\n\n- t=41: on y=8, no car covers x=0, safe.\n\n- t=42: on y=9, no freeway, safe.\n\nSo in 4 turns, I can reach y=9.\n\nBut is that minimal? Since I need to go up 4 steps, 4 is minimal possible.\n\nBut the problem is to avoid collisions, and here it seems fine.\n\nBut let me double-check other freeways, but since I'm only on y=5,6,7,8 during these turns, and y=7 and 8 are always safe, y=5 at t=38 safe, y=6 at t=39 safe.\n\ny=6 at t=39: Δt=1, car position: [-44 + 3(1), -33 + 3(1)] = [-41, -30], which is from -41 to -30, all negative, 0 not included, yes.\n\nAnd at t=49 to 52, it would be covered, but I'm not on y=6 at that time.\n\nSo seems fine.\n\nBut the car on y=6 is the only one that might be a problem, but at t=39 it's fine.\n\nSimilarly, for y=5, at t=38, no issue.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's see if y=5 has any car that covers x=0 at some time.\n\nFreeway 5 cars:\n\nFirst car: (48,37,right,12) at T, [37 +12(T-38), 48+12(T-38)]\n\nSet 37 +12Δt ≤ 0 ≤ 48+12Δt? Left min is 37>0, so never.\n\nSecond car: (12,1,right,12) [1+12(T-38),12+12(T-38)] min 1>0, never covers 0.\n\nThird car: (-24,-35,right,12) tail=-35, head=-24, so [-35+12Δt, -24+12Δt]\n\nSet -35+12Δt ≤ 0 ≤ -24+12Δt\n\nFirst: -35+12Δt ≤0 => 12Δt ≤35 => Δt ≤ 35/12 ≈ 2.916, so Δt ≤ 2\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -24+12Δt => 24 ≤12Δt => Δt ≥ 2\n\nSo Δt=2, at T=40, 0 is covered? Δt=2: -35+24 = -11, -24+24=0, so [ -11, 0 ], and 0 is included? The span is [tail, head], so at T, [ -35 +12Δt, -24 +12Δt ]\n\nAt Δt=2, [ -35+24, -24+24] = [-11, 0], so from -11 to 0 inclusive? Is 0 included?\n\nThe span is inclusive, I assume, since it says \"0 ∈ Span(T)\", and if tail or head at 0, it should be included.\n\nIn the inequality, 0 ≤ -24 +12Δt and -35+12Δt ≤0.\n\nAt Δt=2, left: -35+24= -11 ≤0, right: -24+24=0 ≤0? 0 ≤0 is true, so 0 is in [-11,0], so yes, at T=38+2=40, this car covers x=0 on freeway 5.\n\nBut at t=40, if I were on y=5, it would collide.\n\nIn my plan, at t=40, I am on y=7, not y=5.\n\nAt t=38, I am on y=5, but t=38 Δt=0, [ -35, -24], 0 not in.\n\nAt t=39, Δt=1, [ -35+12, -24+12] = [-23,-12], 0 not in.\n\nAt t=40, Δt=2, [-11,0], 0 included, so if on y=5 at t=40, collision.\n\nBut in my sequence, at t=40, I am on y=7, so no problem.\n\nSimilarly, other times not relevant.\n\nNow back to my sequence: t=38 to t=42 as above.\n\nBut at t=41, I am on y=8, which is safe.\n\nt=42 on y=9.\n\nBut is there any issue with other freeways? For example, when I move to y=6 at t=39, I need to be sure that at t=39, y=6 is safe, which it is.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), and I do at t=42.\n\nBut y=9 is not a freeway, so no collision possible.\n\nNow, but let me check if I can do it in fewer than 4 turns? From y=5 to y=9, I need 4 steps up, so minimum 4 actions, each U, so 4 turns including the start? Let's see the sequence.\n\nAt turn t=38, I start at (0,5). After action at t=38, I move to new position at t=39.\n\nAfter H actions, I should be at y=9 at turn t=38 + H? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence is for t from t₁ to t₁ + H -1, I think.\n\nDefine: at turn t, I am at position y_t.\n\nI take action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nI start at t=38, y=5.\n\nAfter action a_{38}, y_{39} = y_{38} + Δy, etc.\n\nI reach y=9 when y_{t} =9 for some t.\n\nThe minimal H is the number of actions to achieve that.\n\nIf I do nothing, I stay, but I need to reach y=9.\n\nWith 4 U actions: start t=38, y=5\n\na_{38} = U, then t=39, y=6\n\na_{39} = U, t=40, y=7\n\na_{40} = U, t=41, y=8\n\na_{41} = U, t=42, y=9\n\nSo at t=42, y=9, and I have taken 4 actions: from t=38 to t=41 inclusive.\n\nThe actions are at turns t=38 to t=41, so H=4 actions.\n\nThe turn when I reach is t=42.\n\nIn the sequence, it says {a_{t₁ + t} for t=0 to H-1, so a_{38+0}, a_{38+1}, ..., a_{38+H-1}\n\nAfter these actions, at turn t₁ + H, I should be at y=9.\n\nIn this case, t₁ + H = 38 + 4 = 42, y=9.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, is there a way with H=3? That would mean from y=5 to y=9 in 3 steps, but each step can only increase by 1 at most, so y_{t+3} <= y_t + 3 = 8, so at most y=8, not 9. Cannot reach y=9 in 3 actions from y=5. Minimum 4 actions.\n\nSo H=4 is minimal.\n\nAnd in this sequence, no collisions.\n\nBut let me confirm the cars on other freeways, but since I don't go there, no need.\n\nFor example, y=1 to 4, but I'm on y=5,6,7,8 only.\n\nIn the sequence, I am on:\n\nt=38: y=5\n\nt=39: y=6\n\nt=40: y=7\n\nt=41: y=8\n\nt=42: y=9 (not freeway)\n\nAll safe as per above.\n\nBut for y=6, we have a car that covers x=0 at t=49-52, but not at t=39.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways might have cars, but I'm not on them.\n\nFor example, freeway 4: but I don't go there.\n\nSo should be fine.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 6, only one car, which we handled.\n\nBut let me see if there are multiple cars on other freeways, but since I don't visit, irrelevant.\n\nPerhaps I should check if at t=39, y=6 is free, which it is.\n\nAnother thing: the player update: when I move, at turn T, I am on y_T, and after action, I move to new y for next turn.\n\nThe collision is only with the freeway I am currently on.\n\nIn this case, all good.\n\nBut the problem is to output the actions starting from turn t_1=38.\n\nSo actions: turn 38: U, turn 39: U, turn 40: U, turn 41: U.\n\nThen at turn 42, y=9.\n\nBut let me write it in the format.\n\nAnswer should be:\n\nTurn 38: U\n\nTurn 39: U\n\nTurn 40: U\n\nTurn 41: U\n\nAnd H=4.\n\nBut is there any reason why this might not work? For example, at t=39 on y=6, is there any other car? Freeway 6 has only one car, so no.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider if I should stay or something to avoid, but not necessary.\n\nAnother thing: the car on y=5 at t=40 covers x=0, but I'm not on y=5 at t=40.\n\nAt t=40, I am on y=7.\n\nIn my sequence, t=40: y=7.\n\nYes.\n\nTo be thorough, let's see freeway 8 at t=41.\n\nFreeway 8: car (48,25,right,24), at T=41, Δt=3, span [25+24*3, 48+24*3] = [25+72, 48+72] = [97,120], far from 0, safe.\n\nSimilarly, all fine.\n\nSo I think this works.\n\nBut the initial position is (0,5) at turn 38, and I go directly up.\n\nBut let me see the car on y=6; it might be that at some earlier time it covers, but at t=39, it's fine.\n\nΔt=1, position [-44+3(1), -33+3(1)] = [-41,-30], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, at t=40, if I were on y=6, but I'm not.\n\nIn my sequence, I move to y=7 at t=40.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nPerhaps I can go faster, but I can't, since max speed up is one per turn.\n\nUnless I can jump, but no, only +1 per action.\n\nSo minimal H=4 with all U.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\", and I have it.\n\nBut in the answer format, I need to output the actions.\n\nBut let me see if for some reason I need to stay or down, but not necessary.\n\nPerhaps at the start, I could stay, but that would increase H, not minimal.\n\nFor example, if I stay at t=38, then at t=39 still y=5, but at t=39, y=5: Δt=1, cars: first car [37+12(1),48+12(1)]=[49,60], not 0.\n\nSecond [1+12,12+12]=[13,24], no.\n\nThird [-35+12,-24+12]=[-23,-12], no. So safe, but then I have to go up later, so H larger.\n\nSimilarly, not better.\n\nSo U,U,U,U is fine.\n\nBut let me check freeway 3 or others, but I don't go there.\n\nIn the sequence, I only care about the freeways I am on at each turn.\n\nAnother point: when I am on y=8 at t=41, I take U to go to y=9 at t=42.\n\ny=9 has no cars, so fine.\n\nPerhaps I should confirm the car directions.\n\nIn freeway 1 and 2, there are cars, but I never on them.\n\nFor example, freeway 1: cars (-8,-19,right,4), (28,17,right,4), (-48,-59,right,4)\n\nAt T=38, first car: tail=-19, head=-8, span [-19,-8], not 0.\n\nSecond: head=28, tail=17? Tail=17, head=28, so [17,28], not 0.\n\nThird: tail=-59, head=-48, [-59,-48], not 0.\n\nAnd they move, but since I not on y=1, no issue.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nSo I think my sequence is correct.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=4, actions: U at t=38, U at t=39, U at t=40, U at t=41.\n\nNow, in the output format.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 38: U\n\nTurn 39: U\n\nTurn 40: U\n\nTurn 41: U\n\nAnd that's it.\n\nBut the sequence is from t=38 to t=41, H=4.\n\nNow, to box the answer.\n\nBut the problem says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\", so for t=0 to H-1, so a_{38+0}, a_{38+1}, a_{38+2}, a_{38+3} for H=4.\n\nYes.\n\nSo I think that's the answer.\n</think>\nThe goal is to reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 5) at turn \\(t_1 = 38\\) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\), avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis:\n- The player starts at \\(y = 5\\) at turn 38 and needs to reach \\(y = 9\\). Since each \"up\" action (U) increases \\(y\\) by 1, at least 4 actions are required (from \\(y=5\\) to \\(y=9\\)).\n- Collisions occur only if the player is on a freeway \\(y\\) at turn \\(T\\) and a car on that freeway has a span that includes \\(x=0\\) at that turn.\n- Freeways \\(y = 7\\) and \\(y = 8\\) have cars that never cover \\(x=0\\) because their minimum position at any time is positive and increasing (e.g., for freeway 7, the car span at turn 38 is \\([25, 48]\\) and moves right with speed 24, so it is always at least 25).\n- Freeway \\(y = 5\\) at turn 38 is safe, as no car covers \\(x=0\\) (cars at \\([37, 48]\\), \\([1, 12]\\), and \\([-35, -24]\\) all exclude 0).\n- Freeway \\(y = 6\\) has a car that covers \\(x=0\\) only from turns 49 to 52, but at turn 39 (when the player would be on \\(y=6\\) if moving up), it is safe (car span at turn 39 is \\([-41, -30]\\), excluding 0).\n\n### Sequence to Reach \\(y = 9\\) in \\(H = 4\\) Turns:\n- **Turn 38 (current turn, \\(y=5\\)):** Action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y=6\\) at turn 39. At turn 38, \\(y=5\\) is safe (no collision).\n- **Turn 39 (\\(y=6\\)):** Action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y=7\\) at turn 40. At turn 39, \\(y=6\\) is safe (car span \\([-41, -30]\\), 0 not included).\n- **Turn 40 (\\(y=7\\)):** Action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y=8\\) at turn 41. At turn 40, \\(y=7\\) is safe (no car ever covers \\(x=0\\)).\n- **Turn 41 (\\(y=8\\)):** Action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y=9\\) at turn 42. At turn 41, \\(y=8\\) is safe (no car ever covers \\(x=0\\)).\n- At turn 42, \\(y=9\\) is reached. Since \\(y=9\\) is not a freeway, no collision is possible.\n\nThis sequence achieves the goal in \\(H = 4\\) turns, which is minimal because fewer turns (e.g., \\(H=3\\)) cannot increase \\(y\\) from 5 to 9 due to the maximum vertical movement of +1 per turn.\n\n### Output:\nThe sequence of actions for turns 38 to 41 is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 38: U \\\\\nTurn 39: U \\\\\nTurn 40: U \\\\\nTurn 41: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,6) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible without colliding with any cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. Collision happens only if at turn T, I'm on a freeway y_T and 0 is in the span of some car on that freeway at that turn.\n\nFirst, since I start at y=6 and need to get to y=9, I have to move up. But I need to avoid the cars on y=7 and y=8, especially.\n\nThe player movement: U increases y by 1, D decreases by 1, S stays. y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars move left or right with constant speed. For right-moving cars, span is [tail, head] with tail < head, and it moves right with speed s, so at time T, position is [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but in this case, all cars seem to be right-moving based on the data. Let me check the directions.\n\nLooking at the car state:\n\nFreeway 1: all right, speed 4\n\nFreeway 2: same as 1, right, speed 4\n\nFreeway 3: right, speed 6\n\nFreeway 4: right, speed 6\n\nFreeway 5: right, speed 12\n\nFreeway 6: right, speed 3\n\nFreeway 7: right, speed 24\n\nFreeway 8: right, speed 24\n\nAll cars are right-moving. So for each car, at turn T, the span is [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)] where t1 is current turn, 39.\n\nt1 = 39, current turn.\n\nPlayer is at (0,6) at t=39.\n\nI need to reach (0,9) at some turn H steps later, so at turn t1 + H.\n\nBut H is the number of turns, so from t=39 to t=39+H-1? Let's see the sequence.\n\nThe sequence is actions from t= t1 to t= t1 + H -1, and after H actions, at turn t1 + H, position is y_{t1+H}.\n\nDefine the turns clearly.\n\nAt turn t, we take action a_t, then position updates to y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nThe state is given at turn t1=39, position (0,y) with y=6.\n\nAfter action a_{39}, we go to turn 40, position y_{40}, and so on.\n\nWe want to reach position where y_t = 9 for some t.\n\nThe minimal H such that y_{t1 + H} = 9? Not exactly.\n\nThe sequence of actions is from t= t1 to t= t1 + H -1, so after H actions, we are at turn t1 + H, with position y_{t1+H}.\n\nAnd we want y_{t1+H} = 9.\n\nH is the number of turns to take actions.\n\nStart at turn t1=39, position y=6.\n\nAfter 0 actions, at turn 39, y=6.\n\nAfter 1 action (at t=39), at turn 40, y= y_{40}.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t1 + H, y_{t1+H}.\n\nWe want y_{t1+H} = 9 for some minimal H.\n\nAnd during the path, for each turn T from t1 to t1+H-1, when we are at position (0, y_T), we must not collide with cars on freeway y_T at turn T.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if 0 is in the span of some car on freeway y_T at that turn.\n\nNote that when we move, at turn T, we are on y_T, and after action, we move to y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nThe note says: if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you are not on y_{T+1} at turn T, so you don't collide with cars on y_{T+1} at turn T, even if 0 is in span at T for that freeway, because you're not there yet. You only care about the freeway you are on at that turn.\n\nSimilarly, when you arrive at y_{T+1} at turn T+1, you check collision for that freeway at turn T+1.\n\nSo for each turn T, we have position y_T, and we need that for freeway k = y_T, 0 is not in the span of any car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nNow, to reach y=9 from y=6, minimum steps: since we need to go up 3, but we can move diagonally? No, only vertical, but position is (0,y), so only y changes, x is always 0? I think so, player is always at x=0, moving vertically.\n\nPlayer position is (0, y_t), so only y changes with actions U, D, S.\n\nFrom y=6 to y=9, we need at least 3 Up moves, and possibly some S or D, but D would be counterproductive, so probably only U and S.\n\nMinimum H is 3, if we can go directly up without collision.\n\nBut we need to check if at each step, when we are on y=6,7,8,9, no collision at that turn and freeway.\n\nBut we start at y=6 at turn 39, and we need to be at y=9 at turn 39+H.\n\nFor collision, we care about the path: for each turn T, y_T must be safe.\n\nFor example, at turn 39, we are on y=6, so we need freeway 6 to be safe at turn 39.\n\nThen after action, at turn 40, we are on y_{40}, which could be 5,6,7 depending on action.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nFirst, let's list the car positions over time for each freeway.\n\nt1 = 39.\n\nFor each freeway, cars are given with head, tail, direction, speed. Since all right-moving, direction is right, so span at t1 is [τ, h] with τ < h.\n\nAt turn T, span is [τ + s*(T-39), h + s*(T-39)]\n\nCollision on freeway k at turn T if 0 is in [τ + s*(T-39), h + s*(T-39)] for some car on that freeway.\n\nSince the player is at x=0, so if 0 is in the car's span at that turn.\n\nNow, for each freeway, let's find when 0 is covered by a car.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: cars: (-4,-15,right,4), (32,21,right,4), (-44,-55,right,4)\n\nFor a car, span at T: [τ + 4*(T-39), h + 4*(T-39)]\n\nFirst car: τ = -15, h = -4? Head is -4, tail is -15? But head should be larger for right-moving.\n\nIn the table, it says \"head h, tail τ\", and for right-moving, it should be tail to head, with tail < head.\n\nBut look: (-4,-15,right,4), here h = -4, τ = -15, and -4 > -15, so [τ, h] = [-15, -4] at t=39.\n\nSimilarly, (32,21,right,4), h=32, τ=21? 32>21, so [21,32]? But tail τ=21, head h=32, so span [21,32].\n\nBut 21 to 32, and direction right, so at t=39, [τ, h] = [21,32]? τ=21, h=32, so [21,32].\n\nBut in the list, it's written as (head, tail, dir, speed), so for this one, head=32, tail=21, so since right, tail < head, span [21,32].\n\nSimilarly, first car: head=-4, tail=-15, so tail=-15, head=-4, span [-15,-4].\n\nThird car: head=-44, tail=-55, span [-55,-44].\n\nAnd all speed 4.\n\nNow, at turn T, span for first car: [-15 + 4*(T-39), -4 + 4*(T-39)]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, 0 in span if min <= 0 <= max.\n\nSimilarly for other freeways.\n\nBut we care about freeway y_T when we are on it.\n\nSince we need to go from y=6 to y=9, and freeways 6,7,8 are between, we need to pass through them or stay.\n\ny=6 is freeway 6, y=7 is freeway 7, etc.\n\nThe freeways are y=1 to 8, so for player position y, if y between 1 and 8, it's a freeway, else y=0 or 9, no cars.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nThe player starts at y=6, which is a freeway, so we need to check safety at turn 39 for freeway 6.\n\nSimilarly, when we move to y=7,8, we need to check at the turn we are on them.\n\ny=9 is goal, no issue.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway k, for which turns T, freeway k is unsafe, i.e., some car covers x=0.\n\nThen for our path, when we are on freeway k at turn T, it must be safe at that T.\n\nNow, since we move step by step, we need to plan the sequence.\n\nFirst, let's compute for each freeway the times when it is unsafe.\n\nStart with freeway 1.\n\nFreeway 1 cars:\n\nCar1: at t=39, span [-15, -4]\n\nAt T, span: [-15 + 4(dt), -4 + 4(dt)] where dt = T-39\n\n0 in span if -15 + 4dt <= 0 <= -4 + 4dt\n\nSo -15 + 4dt <= 0 and 0 <= -4 + 4dt\n\nFirst inequality: 4dt <= 15, dt <= 15/4 = 3.75, so dt <= 3 since integer? dt integer, turns are discrete.\n\nT integer, dt integer.\n\n-15 + 4dt <= 0 => 4dt <= 15 => dt <= 3.75, so dt <= 3 since integer? 4*3=12, -15+12=-3 <=0, yes; dt=4, -15+16=1>0? -15+4dt <=0\n\n4dt <=15, dt<=3.75, so for dt=0,1,2,3: -15+4*0=-15<=0, -15+4=-11<=0, -15+8=-7<=0, -15+12=-3<=0; dt=4, -15+16=1>0, not <=0.\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= -4 + 4dt => 4dt >=4 => dt >=1\n\nSo 0 in span for dt from 1 to 3 inclusive? Let's see:\n\nFor dt=1: -15+4= -11, -4+4=0, so [-11,0], 0 <=0 is true? 0 <=0, yes, included.\n\nSpan [min,max], 0 in if min <=0<=max.\n\nmin = -15 +4dt, max= -4 +4dt\n\nFor dt=1: min=-11, max=0, -11 <=0<=0, yes 0==0.\n\ndt=2: min=-15+8=-7, max=-4+8=4, -7<=0<=4, yes.\n\ndt=3: min=-15+12=-3, max=-4+12=8, -3<=0<=8, yes.\n\ndt=4: min=-15+16=1, max=-4+16=12, 1<=0<=12? 1<=0 false, so 0 not in [1,12].\n\ndt=0: min=-15, max=-4, -15<=0<=-4? 0<=-4 false, no.\n\nSo car1 covers 0 at dt=1,2,3 i.e. T=40,41,42.\n\nT=39 + dt, dt=T-39.\n\nT=40,41,42.\n\nNow car2 on freeway1: head=32, tail=21, speed4, at T span [21 +4dt, 32 +4dt]\n\n0 in span? 21+4dt <=0 <=32+4dt? But 21+4dt >=21>0 for dt>=0, so min >=21>0, so 0 never in span. Car is always to the right.\n\nSimilarly car3: head=-44, tail=-55, span [-55 +4dt, -44 +4dt]\n\nmin = -55 +4dt, max= -44 +4dt\n\n0 in if min<=0<=max\n\nmin<=0: -55+4dt<=0 => 4dt<=55 => dt<=13.75\n\nmax>=0: -44+4dt>=0 => 4dt>=44 => dt>=11\n\nSo for dt from 11 to 13 inclusive.\n\ndt=11: min=-55+44= -11, max=-44+44=0, [-11,0], 0 in\n\ndt=12: min=-55+48= -7, max=-44+48=4, [-7,4], 0 in\n\ndt=13: min=-55+52= -3, max=-44+52=8, [-3,8], 0 in\n\ndt=14: min=-55+56=1, max=-44+56=12, [1,12], 0 not in\n\nSo car3 covers at T=39+11=50, 51,52.\n\nBut freeway1 has multiple cars, so unsafe if any car covers 0.\n\nSo for freeway1, unsafe at T=40,41,42 (from car1), and T=50,51,52 (from car3), car2 never.\n\nT=40,41,42 and 50,51,52.\n\nNow freeway2: same as freeway1, according to table: \"2 | same as 1\"\n\n| 2 | \\((-4, -15, right, 4), (32, 21, right, 4), (-44, -55, right, 4)\\) | same as freeway1.\n\nSo identical to freeway1, unsafe at same times: T=40,41,42 and 50,51,52.\n\nNow freeway3: cars: (0, -11, right, 6), (-36, -47, right, 6), (42, 31, right, 6)\n\nFirst car: head=0, tail=-11, speed6, at T span [-11 +6dt, 0 +6dt] = [-11+6dt, 6dt]\n\nAt dt=0, T=39, span [-11,0], so 0 in, since min<=0<=max.\n\n0 <=0 true.\n\nSo at T=39, covered.\n\nNow for dt: min = -11 +6dt, max=6dt\n\n0 in if min<=0<=max\n\nmin<=0: -11+6dt<=0 => 6dt<=11 => dt<=11/6≈1.833, so dt<=1\n\nmax>=0: 6dt>=0 always for dt>=0\n\nSo for dt=0: min=-11<=0, max=0, 0 in\n\ndt=1: min=-11+6=-5, max=6, -5<=0<=6, yes\n\ndt=2: min=-11+12=1, max=12, 1<=0<=12? false, not\n\nSo car1 covers at dt=0 and 1, T=39 and 40.\n\nT=39: min=-11, max=0, 0 in\n\nT=40: min=-5, max=6, 0 in\n\nT=41: min=1, max=12, 0 not in\n\nNow second car: head=-36, tail=-47, speed6, span [-47+6dt, -36+6dt]\n\nmin = -47+6dt, max= -36+6dt\n\n0 in if min<=0<=max\n\nmin<=0: -47+6dt<=0 => 6dt<=47 => dt<=47/6≈7.833, dt<=7\n\nmax>=0: -36+6dt>=0 => 6dt>=36 => dt>=6\n\nSo dt from 6 to 7 inclusive.\n\ndt=6: min=-47+36= -11, max=-36+36=0, [-11,0], 0 in\n\ndt=7: min=-47+42= -5, max=-36+42=6, [-5,6], 0 in\n\ndt=8: min=-47+48=1, max=-36+48=12, [1,12], 0 not in\n\nSo car2 covers at T=39+6=45 and 46.\n\nThird car: head=42, tail=31, speed6, span [31+6dt, 42+6dt], min=31+6dt >=31>0, so never covers 0.\n\nSo freeway3 unsafe when: from car1: T=39,40; from car2: T=45,46; car3 never.\n\nSo overall, unsafe at T=39,40,45,46.\n\nNow freeway4: same as freeway3?

From above, freeway 6 unsafe at T=49,50,51,52, not at 39.\n\nAt T=39, dt=0, min=-41, max=-30, both negative, so 0 not in [-41,-30], safe.\n\nSimilarly, for other times except 49-52.\n\nSo at turn 39, freeway 6 is safe.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\ny=9 is safe, no cars.\n\nThe path: we start at y=6, turn 39.\n\nWe need to go to y=7,8,9.\n\nBut we might need to wait or move down to avoid collisions.\n\nBut since we want minimal H, we should go up as fast as possible, unless blocked.\n\nMinimum 3 steps: but let's see if possible in 3 steps.\n\nSuppose actions: U,U,U or something.\n\nStart: turn 39, y=6, safe as above.\n\nAfter action a_{39}, at turn 40, position y_{40}.\n\nIf we go U, y_{40} =7.\n\nAt turn 40, we are on y=7.\n\nFreeway 7: always safe, so y=7 at turn 40 is safe.\n\nThen action a_{40}, if U, y_{41}=8.\n\nAt turn 41, on y=8, freeway 8 always safe, safe.\n\nThen action a_{41}, if U, y_{42}=9, reached.\n\nAt turn 42, position y=9, which is safe.\n\nNow, we need to check for each turn, the position and freeway safety.\n\nTurn 39: on y=6, freeway 6 safe at T=39.\n\nTurn 40: on y=7 (after moving up from 6), freeway 7 always safe, so safe.\n\nTurn 41: on y=8, freeway 8 always safe, safe.\n\nTurn 42: on y=9, safe.\n\nSo with actions: at t=39: U, to y=7 at t=40\n\nt=40: U, to y=8 at t=41\n\nt=41: U, to y=9 at t=42\n\nH=3, from t=39 to t=41 actions, 3 actions, after which at t=42, y=9.\n\nThe sequence: actions at t=39,40,41.\n\nNow, is there any issue?\n\nAt turn 40, we are on y=7, freeway 7 safe, yes.\n\nBut what about freeway 6 at turn 40? We are not on it at turn 40, we moved to y=7 at turn 40, so at turn 40, we are on y=7, not y=6.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 39, we were on y=6.\n\nIn the sequence above, all seems safe.\n\nBut let's confirm the car positions briefly.\n\nFor example, at turn 40, if we were on y=6, it would be unsafe? Freeway 6 at T=40: dt=1, min=-41+3= -38, max=-30+3= -27, both negative, 0 not in [-38,-27], safe. But we are not on it anyway.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 7 at T=40: min=49+24*1=73? dt=1, T=40, dt=T-39=1.\n\nFreeway 7 car: span [49 +24dt, 72+24dt], at dt=1, [73,96], not covering 0.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nBut is there a problem with other freeways? No, because we only care about the freeway we are on.\n\nIn this path: turn 39: y=6, freeway 6 safe.\n\nTurn 40: y=7, freeway 7 safe.\n\nTurn 41: y=8, freeway 8 safe.\n\nTurn 42: y=9, safe.\n\nPerfect, and H=3.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), and we do at turn 42.\n\nBut let's see if freeway 6 is ever unsafe at early times? At T=40, freeway 6 is safe, as above.\n\nFreeway 6 unsafe only at T=49-52, which is later.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways have unsafe times, but we are not on them when they are unsafe in this path.\n\nFor example, freeway 5 unsafe at T=40, but at T=40, we are on y=7, not y=5.\n\nFreeway 3 unsafe at T=39,40, but we are on y=6 at T=39, which is different, and at T=40 on y=7.\n\nSo no collision.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 3, with actions U,U,U at turns 39,40,41.\n\nBut the sequence is for t from t1 to t1+H-1, so t=39,40,41.\n\nAnswer should be:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} = U\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 +1} = U? t1=39, t1+1=40, a_{40}=U\n\nTurn t_1 + 2: a_{41}=U\n\nH=3, actions at t=39,40,41.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut is there any reason we cannot do this? Seems fine.\n\nPerhaps I should check if at turn 39, freeway 6 is safe, which it is.\n\nMaybe the player has to avoid being on unsafe freeways, but in this case, all is well.\n\nPerhaps I misread the car on freeway 6.\n\nFreeway 6: car (-30,-41,right,3) at t=39, span [-41,-30]\n\nAt T=40, span [-41+3, -30+3] = [-38,-27], 0 not in.\n\nAt T=39, [-41,-30], 0 not in.\n\nUnsafe only at T=49 to 52.\n\nSo yes.\n\nPerhaps the note about moving: when we move at turn T from y to y+1, at turn T we are still on y, and at turn T+1 on y+1.\n\nIn this case, at turn 39, on y=6.\n\nAction U, so at turn 40, on y=7.\n\nNo issue.\n\nSo I think H=3 is possible.\n\nBut let's see the car states again, maybe I missed something.\n\nAnother thing: freeway 3 has a car at T=39 with head=0, tail=-11, so at T=39, span [-11,0], which includes 0, so freeway 3 unsafe at T=39.\n\nBut we are not on freeway 3 at T=39, we are on freeway 6.\n\nSimilarly, at T=40, freeway 3 also unsafe, but we are on freeway 7.\n\nNo problem.\n\nPerhaps for y=6, but freeway 6 is safe at the relevant times.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nBut the problem is to go to (0,9), which is y=9, and we reach in 3 turns.\n\nBut let's confirm if we can go faster? 3 is minimum since we need to increase by 3.\n\nH=3 means 3 actions, from y=6 to 9.\n\nIf we do S or D, it would take more turns, so H=3 is minimal.\n\nBut is there a reason we must take more? For example, if at some point we need to wait.\n\nBut in this case, no need.\n\nPerhaps at turn 40, if we were to go to y=8, but we go step by step.\n\nIn this path, we go through y=7 and y=8, both safe at the times.\n\nFreeway 7 and 8 always safe.\n\nSo should be ok.\n\nBut let's see the answer format.\n\nWe need to output the sequence.\n\nBut H=3, actions: a_{39}=U, a_{40}=U, a_{41}=U\n\nThen at turn 42, position y=9.\n\nThe sequence from t=39 to t=41.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut the player position at turn 39 is (0,6), and after actions, reaches (0,9) at turn 42.\n\nCollision avoidance: for each turn T, when on y_T, freeway safe.\n\nT=39: y=6, freeway 6 safe.\n\nT=40: y=7, freeway 7 safe.\n\nT=41: y=8, freeway 8 safe.\n\nT=42: y=9, no freeway, safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if we can reach earlier, but at turn 39, we start at y=6, so earliest to reach y=9 is turn 42.\n\ny_{t} at t=39:6, t=40:7 if U, t=41:8 if U, t=42:9 if U.\n\nSo minimal H=3.\n\nBut in the car list, for freeway 6, it has only one car, but in the table it says \"6 | (-30,-41,right,3)\" only one car.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nI think it's correct.\n\nBut the problem says \"avoid collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to 8\", and we do.\n\nSo I think we can go directly.\n\nBut just to be thorough, suppose at turn 39 we do S, stay at y=6.\n\nThen at turn 40, still on y=6.\n\nFreeway 6 at T=40: as above, safe, min=-38,max=-27, not cover 0.\n\nThen we can go U to y=7 at turn 41, etc., but that takes more turns, not minimal.\n\nSimilarly, if we go D, worse.\n\nSo no need.\n\nThus minimal is 3 turns.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nTurn t_1: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 2: U\n\nWith H=3.\n\nIn the answer format.\n\n\\boxed{ Turn t_1: U \\\\ Turn t_1 + 1: U \\\\ Turn t_1 + 2: U }\n\nBut let's write the actions.\n\nSince t1=39, but in the answer, it should be in terms of t1.\n\n\"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc.\n\nIn the box.\n\nI think that's it.\n</think>\nThe goal is to reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 6) at turn \\(t_1 = 39\\) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\). Collision occurs only if the player is on a freeway \\(y_T\\) at turn \\(T\\) and the position \\(x = 0\\) is within the span of any car on that freeway at turn \\(T\\).\n\n### Analysis of Safe Path\n- The player starts at \\(y = 6\\) (freeway 6) at turn 39. Freeway 6 is safe at turn 39 because no car covers \\(x = 0\\) (car span: \\([-41, -30]\\), \\(0 \\notin [-41, -30]\\)).\n- Moving up to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 40: Freeway 7 is always safe (car span at all times has minimum position \\(\\geq 49 > 0\\)).\n- Moving up to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 41: Freeway 8 is always safe (car span at all times has minimum position \\(\\geq 49 > 0\\)).\n- Reaching \\(y = 9\\) at turn 42: \\(y = 9\\) has no cars and is safe.\n\nThe sequence of actions to achieve this in \\(H = 3\\) turns (actions at turns 39, 40, and 41) is:\n- Turn 39: Action \\(U\\) (move to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 40).\n- Turn 40: Action \\(U\\) (move to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 41).\n- Turn 41: Action \\(U\\) (move to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 42).\n\n### Collision Avoidance Verification\n- Turn 39: Player at \\(y = 6\\). Freeway 6 is safe at turn 39 (no car covers \\(x = 0\\)).\n- Turn 40: Player at \\(y = 7\\). Freeway 7 is safe at turn 40 (car span: \\([49 + 24 \\times 1, 72 + 24 \\times 1] = [73, 96]\\), \\(0 \\notin [73, 96]\\)).\n- Turn 41: Player at \\(y = 8\\). Freeway 8 is safe at turn 41 (car span: \\([49 + 24 \\times 2, 72 + 24 \\times 2] = [97, 120]\\), \\(0 \\notin [97, 120]\\)).\n\nThis path achieves the goal in the minimal \\(H = 3\\) turns, as fewer turns are impossible (requiring at least 3 up moves to increase \\(y\\) from 6 to 9). Other actions (e.g., staying or moving down) would increase \\(H\\).\n\n### Answer\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H = 3\\) with the sequence of actions:\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } t_1: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 1: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 2: \\text{ U} }",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,7) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible without colliding with any cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The player moves vertically with actions U (up), D (down), or S (stay), changing y by +1, -1, or 0, and y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars are on each freeway k from 1 to 8, and they move horizontally. For each car, I'm given its head and tail positions at turn t_1=40, along with direction and speed. Left-moving cars have head on the left, tail on the right, I think? Let me read carefully.\n\nIt says: for left-moving, span is [h, τ], and for right-moving, it's [τ, h], but then in the update, left-moving decreases position, right-moving increases.\n\nFor left-moving: span at t_1 is [h, τ], and at T, it's [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)], so h and τ decrease, meaning the car is moving left.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving: span at t_1 is [τ, h], and at T, [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)], so positions increase, moving right.\n\nIn the collision condition, it says collision occurs at turn T if 0 is in the span of any car on freeway y_T.\n\nAnd importantly, when you move to y_{T+1} at turn T, you are not considered on y_{T+1} until the next turn, so you only check for collision on the freeway you're currently on at that turn.\n\nAt turn T, you are on position y_T, and you choose an action, then you move to y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy, and at turn T+1, you are on y_{T+1}.\n\nBut for collision, it says: \"collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nSo at turn T, you are on freeway y_T, and you check if at that turn, for that freeway, there is a car whose span contains x=0.\n\nAnd since you move after the collision check? Let me see the sequence.\n\nActually, the game dynamics don't specify the exact sequence, but from the collision rule, it seems that at each turn T, you are at position (0, y_T), and then you perform an action, but the collision is checked at the beginning of the turn or something?\n\nLet's read carefully: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd the note: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nThis implies that at turn T, you are on y_T, and collision is based on cars on y_T at that turn.\n\nThen, after action, you move to y_{T+1} for the next turn.\n\nSo for each turn, when you are at (0, y_t), you check if there is a car on freeway y_t that has 0 in its span at time t. If so, collision.\n\nOtherwise, you choose action, and move to new position for t+1.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=7 at t=40 to y=9.\n\ny=9 is the goal, but y=9 is not a freeway; freeways are y=1 to 8. y=0 and y=9 are safe, I think? The vertical axis is y=0,1,2,...,9, and freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, so no cars there, so they are safe positions.\n\nThe player position is (0,y), and y from 0 to 9.\n\nFreeways have cars only for y=1 to 8.\n\nSo y=0 and y=9 have no cars, so as long as you are there, no collision possible.\n\nThe goal is to reach (0,9).\n\nNow, I start at (0,7) at turn t_1=40.\n\nI need to find a sequence of actions to get to y=9 as quickly as possible, min H, the number of turns.\n\nH is the number of actions, so from t=40 to t=40+H-1, so after H actions, at time t=40+H, y=9.\n\nLet's see: at turn t, position y_t.\n\nAfter action a_t, y_{t+1} is set.\n\nSo at turn t=40, y=7.\n\nI apply a sequence of actions for t=40,41,42,..., up to some t=40+H-1, and after that, at turn t=40+H, y_{40+H} =9.\n\nAnd for each turn from t=40 to t=40+H-1, when at position, no collision.\n\nAt turn t=40+H, we are at (0,9), which is safe, so no need to check collision there, I think, since it's the goal.\n\nThe collision is only checked when on freeways y=1 to 8.\n\nSo for turns when y_t between 1 and 8, we need to ensure no car on that freeway has 0 in span at time t.\n\nNow, to reach y=9 from y=7, I need to go up, but I might need to go down or stay to avoid cars.\n\nFirst, let's list all the car positions for each freeway at time t.\n\nCurrent turn t_1=40.\n\nFor each car, I need to find for which times the span contains x=0.\n\nSince the cars move at constant speed, the span at time T is linear.\n\nLet Δt = T - t_1 = T - 40.\n\nThen for a car, at time T, span is:\n\nIf left-moving: [h - s Δt, τ - s Δt]\n\nBut in the given, for left-moving, span is given as [h, τ] with h and τ, and it moves left, so positions decrease.\n\nIn the table, all cars are right-moving, I think? Let's see the direction.\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 1: (0,-11,right,4), (36,25,right,4), (-40,-51,right,4) all right.\n\nSimilarly, all are right-moving, since direction is \"right\".\n\nIn the table, for each, it says \"direction d\", and all are \"right\", so all cars are moving right.\n\nNo left-moving cars here.\n\nSo for right-moving cars, span at t_1 is [τ, h], and at T, [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt].\n\nIn the notation, for right-moving, it says span(t_1) = [τ, h], meaning from τ to h, with τ < h I assume? But in the values, let's see.\n\nFor example, freeway 1, first car: (0, -11, right, 4)\n\nNow, span(t_1) = [τ, h] = [-11, 0]? But it says (head, tail, direction, speed) = (0, -11, right, 4)\n\nAnd for right-moving, span(t_1) = [τ, h] = [-11, 0], I think? But -11 to 0, with τ = -11, h=0.\n\nThen at time T, span(T) = [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] = [-11 + 4 Δt, 0 + 4 Δt]\n\nSimilarly, second car: (36, 25, right, 4) — head 36, tail 25? But if it's right-moving, span should be [τ, h] with τ < h, but here head=36, tail=25, so if tail=25, head=36, then τ=25, h=36, so [25,36] at t_1.\n\nSimilarly, third car: (-40,-51,right,4), tail=-51, head=-40, so span [-51,-40] at t_1.\n\nIn the car state, it's listed as (head, tail, direction, speed), but for right-moving, since it's moving right, head should be on the right, tail on left, so span from tail to head.\n\nIn the notation, for right-moving, span(t_1) = [τ, h] with τ and h such that τ < h.\n\nIn the first car, head=0, tail=-11, so τ=-11, h=0, so [τ,h] = [-11,0]\n\nSimilarly, second: head=36, tail=25, so [25,36]\n\nThird: head=-40, tail=-51, so [-51,-40]\n\nOkay.\n\nNow, for collision, at time T, on freeway k, if there is a car with 0 in [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] for that car.\n\n0 is in the interval if min(τ + s Δt, h + s Δt) ≤ 0 ≤ max(τ + s Δt, h + s Δt)\n\nSince τ and h, for right-moving, τ < h, so min is τ + s Δt, max is h + s Δt, so 0 in [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] iff τ + s Δt ≤ 0 ≤ h + s Δt.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but no left here.\n\nNow Δt = T - 40.\n\nAlso, for each freeway, multiple cars, so if any car has 0 in span, collision.\n\nNow, I need to find, for each freeway, for which times T, 0 is covered by some car.\n\nThat is, for each freeway, the times when it is occupied at x=0.\n\nThen, when I am on that freeway at time T, I need to avoid those times.\n\nNow, I start at y=7 at t=40.\n\nI need to get to y=9.\n\nPossible actions: U, D, S, changing y by +1, -1, 0.\n\nSince y=9 is above, I probably want to go up, but I might need to wait or go down to avoid bad times.\n\nFirst, let's analyze each freeway occupancy at x=0.\n\nStart with freeway 1.\n\nFreeway 1 has three cars:\n\nCar A: τ = -11, h = 0, s = 4\n\nAt T, span: [-11 + 4 Δt, 0 + 4 Δt] = [-11 + 4 Δt, 4 Δt]\n\n0 in this if -11 + 4 Δt ≤ 0 ≤ 4 Δt\n\nSince 4 Δt ≥ 0, the upper bound is always >=0 for Δt >=0, but lower bound <=0.\n\n-11 + 4 Δt ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ 4 Δt\n\n0 ≤ 4 Δt is always true for Δt >=0.\n\n-11 + 4 Δt ≤ 0 implies 4 Δt ≤ 11, Δt ≤ 11/4 = 2.75\n\nAlso, since 0 ≤ 4 Δt, which is Δt >=0.\n\nSo for car A, 0 in span when -11 + 4 Δt ≤ 0, i.e., Δt ≤ 11/4 = 2.75\n\nSince Δt integer, Δt <= 2 because 2.75, so Δt = 0,1,2\n\nAt Δt=0: span [-11,0], 0 is included.\n\nAt Δt=1: [-11+4,4] = [-7,4], 0 in\n\nAt Δt=2: [-11+8,8] = [-3,8], 0 in\n\nAt Δt=3: [-11+12,12] = [1,12], 0 not in since min=1>0\n\nSimilarly, car B: τ=25, h=36, s=4\n\nSpan at T: [25 + 4 Δt, 36 + 4 Δt]\n\nBoth min and max >0 for Δt >=0, so 0 never in, since 25>0.\n\nSimilarly, car C: τ=-51, h=-40, s=4\n\nSpan: [-51 + 4 Δt, -40 + 4 Δt]\n\nBoth negative for reasonable Δt, since at Δt=0, [-51,-40], min=-51<0, max=-40<0, so 0 not in.\n\nFor larger Δt, min increases, but when does it reach 0? -51 + 4 Δt <=0 only if Δt <= 51/4=12.75, but max -40 +4 Δt <=0 for Δt <=10, since -40+40=0 at Δt=10.\n\n-40 +4 Δt <=0 for Δt <=10, and -51+4 Δt <=0 for Δt <=12.75, but for 0 to be in, need min <=0 <= max, i.e. -51+4 Δt <=0 and 0 <= -40+4 Δt? 0 <= -40+4 Δt implies 4 Δt >=40, Δt >=10\n\nAnd -51+4 Δt <=0 implies 4 Δt <=51, Δt <=12.75\n\nBut 0 <= -40+4 Δt means 40 <= 4 Δt, Δt >=10\n\nAnd -51+4 Δt <=0 is always true if Δt >=10 since -51+40=-11<0, etc.\n\nSpecifically:\n\nmin = -51 +4 Δt\n\nmax = -40 +4 Δt\n\n0 in [min,max] iff min <=0 and max >=0? No.\n\n[min,max] contains 0 iff min <=0 <= max, since min <= max.\n\nSo min <=0 and max >=0.\n\nmin <=0: -51 +4 Δt <=0 => 4 Δt <=51 => Δt <= 12.75\n\nmax >=0: -40 +4 Δt >=0 => 4 Δt >=40 => Δt >=10\n\nSo for Δt from 10 to 12 inclusive, since integer.\n\nAt Δt=10: min=-51+40=-11, max=-40+40=0, so [ -11,0], 0 included.\n\nAt Δt=11: min=-51+44=-7, max=-40+44=4, [-7,4], 0 in.\n\nAt Δt=12: min=-51+48=-3, max=-40+48=8, [-3,8], 0 in.\n\nAt Δt=13: min=-51+52=1, max=-40+52=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo for car C, occupied at Δt=10,11,12.\n\nBut for freeway 1, car A occupies at Δt=0,1,2\n\nCar B never\n\nCar C occupies at Δt=10,11,12\n\nSo overall for freeway 1, occupied when Δt=0,1,2 or 10,11,12.\n\nThat is, times T=40,41,42 and 50,51,52.\n\nNow, similarly for other freeways.\n\nBut I need for each freeway separately.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: occupied at T=40,41,42,50,51,52.\n\nNow freeway 2: same as freeway 1? Look.\n\nFreeway 2: | 2 | (0, -11, right, 4), (36, 25, right, 4), (-40, -51, right, 4) |\n\nExactly same as freeway 1. So same occupancy: T=40,41,42,50,51,52.\n\nNow freeway 3: | 3 | (6, -5, right, 6), (-30, -41, right, 6), (48, 37, right, 6) |\n\nCars:\n\nFirst car: head=6, tail=-5, right, s=6.

Since Δt integer, Δt=0.\n\nAt Δt=0: [-5,6], 0 in.\n\nAt Δt=1: [-5+6,6+6]=[1,12], min=1>0, 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: head=-30? tail=-41, head=-30? Direction right.\n\nτ = tail? In (head, tail) = (-30, -41), so head=-30, tail=-41.\n\nSince right-moving, τ should be tail, h=head, so τ=-41, h=-30.\n\nSpan: [ -41 +6 Δt, -30 +6 Δt ]\n\nmin <=0 <= max: -41+6 Δt <=0 and -30+6 Δt >=0\n\n-41+6 Δt <=0 => 6 Δt <=41 => Δt <= 41/6 ≈6.833\n\n-30+6 Δt >=0 => 6 Δt >=30 => Δt >=5\n\nSo Δt from 5 to 6 inclusive.\n\nAt Δt=5: min=-41+30=-11, max=-30+30=0, [-11,0], 0 in.\n\nΔt=6: min=-41+36=-5, max=-30+36=6, [-5,6], 0 in.\n\nΔt=7: min=-41+42=1, max=-30+42=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nThird car: head=48, tail=37, right, s=6. τ=37, h=48.\n\nSpan: [37+6 Δt, 48+6 Δt], min=37>0, so never 0 in.\n\nSo for freeway 3, car1 at Δt=0, car2 at Δt=5,6, car3 never.\n\nSo occupied at Δt=0,5,6.

So at t=40, on y=7, no car at x=0, so safe.\n\nI need to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\ny=9 is safe, no freeway.\n\nThe minimal H would be if I go up directly: from y=7 to y=8 at t=41, then to y=9 at t=42.\n\nBut need to check if safe.\n\nAt t=40: y=7, freeway 7 occupied only at T=42, not at 40, so safe. I can choose action.\n\nSuppose I go up, a_{40} = U, so y_{41} = 8.\n\nNow at t=41: I am at y=8.\n\nFreeway 8 occupied only at T=42, not at 41, so safe? Occupied times: y=8 at T=42 only, not 41.\n\nSo at t=41, on y=8, no car, safe.\n\nThen I choose action, say U again to go to y=9.\n\na_{41} = U, y_{42} = 9.\n\nNow at t=42, I am at y=9, which is not a freeway, so no collision check, and I have reached.\n\nBut H is the number of turns? Let's see.\n\nAt turn t=40, I start at y=7.\n\nAfter action at t=40, y_{41} =8.\n\nAfter action at t=41, y_{42}=9.\n\nSo at turn t=42, y=9, which is the goal.\n\nNumber of actions: from t=40 to t=41, that's two actions? Let's define H.\n\nThe sequence is actions for t from t_1 to t_1 + H - 1, and after H actions, at turn t_1 + H, y =9.\n\nHere, actions at t=40 and t=41, so H=2, and at t=42, y=9.\n\nNow, during the process:\n\nAt t=40: position y=7, freeway 7, occupied? At T=40, for y=7, we have occupied only at T=42, not 40, so safe.\n\nAction U, y_{41}=8.\n\nAt t=41: position y=8, freeway 8, occupied only at T=42, not 41, so safe.\n\nAction U, y_{42}=9.\n\nAt t=42: y=9, not freeway, safe.\n\nBut is there any issue at t=42? At t=42, I am at y=9, so no collision.\n\nBut let's check if on the way, any problem.\n\nSpecifically, at t=41, when I am on y=8, is it safe? Yes, since no car at T=41 for y=8.\n\nSimilarly, y=7 at t=40 safe.\n\nBut what about the action? When I move from y=7 to y=8 at turn t=40, I am not on y=8 at turn t=40, only at t=41 I am on y=8.\n\nThe note says: if you move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you are not on y_{T+1} at turn T.\n\nSo at turn T, you are on y_T.\n\nIn this case, at turn 40, on y=7.\n\nAt turn 41, on y=8.\n\nAt turn 42, on y=9.\n\nAll safe for these positions at those times.\n\nBut at t=42, y=9, no freeway.\n\nIs there a car at t=42 on some freeway? But I'm not on it.\n\nSo seems I can reach in 2 turns.\n\nBut let me confirm the occupancy.\n\nFor y=7, only occupied at T=42.\n\nAt T=42, if I were on y=7, I would collide, but at t=42, I am on y=9, not y=7.\n\nSimilarly, y=8 occupied at T=42, but at t=42, I am on y=9.\n\nAt t=41, I am on y=8, which is not occupied at T=41.\n\nSo yes.\n\nBut the goal is to reach (0,9), which I do at t=42.\n\nBut is y=9 considered reached when I am at (0,9), which is at turn t=42.\n\nH=2 turns: actions at t=40 and t=41.\n\nSequence: turn 40: U, turn 41: U.\n\nBut let me see if there is any reason I cannot.\n\nPerhaps I should check other freeways, but I don't go there.\n\nMaybe for completeness.\n\nBut in this path, I only touch y=7 at t=40, y=8 at t=41, and y=9 at t=42.\n\nAll safe.\n\nBut what about t=42? At t=42, y=7 and y=8 are occupied, but I am not there.\n\nSo it should be fine.\n\nBut let me see the times again.\n\nPerhaps I can reach faster? From y=7 to y=9 in one step? But actions only change by +1 or -1 or 0, so I need at least two steps to go from 7 to 9, since 7 to 8, then 8 to 9.\n\nMinimal H is 2.\n\nWith S, I can stay, but that would take more turns, so not minimal.\n\nBut in this case, with U,U in two turns, it seems possible.\n\nBut let me double-check the occupancy at the critical points.\n\nAt t=40: y=7, freeway 7 occupied only at T=42, not 40. T=40 is free, so safe.\n\nAt t=41: y=8, freeway 8 occupied only at T=42, not 41. T=41 is free, safe.\n\nThen U to y=9.\n\nBut is freeway 8 occupied at other times? No, only T=42.\n\nSimilarly, y=7 only T=42.\n\nBut at t=42, I am at y=9.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if going up directly is blocked.\n\nAnother thing: when I go from y=7 to y=8 at turn t=40, at that turn, I am on y=7, and moving, but the collision is only at the position at the start of the turn.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nBut let me see the car on freeway 6 or others, but I don't go there.\n\nPerhaps I can consider the state at t=40.\n\nStart at y=7, t=40.\n\nIf I go up to y=8 at t=41.\n\nThen at t=41, on y=8, if safe, go up to y=9 at t=42.\n\nNow, is y=8 safe at t=41? From above, yes.\n\nIf I stay at y=7 at t=40, then y=7 at t=41.\n\nAt t=41, y=7, freeway 7 occupied only at T=42, not 41, so safe, but then I waste a turn.\n\nSimilarly, if I go down, worse.\n\nSo direct up seems best.\n\nBut let me check if at t=40, going up is ok.\n\nPerhaps for y=7, at T=40, is there a car?\n\nFreeway 7: cars, only one, at T=42 only.\n\nSimilarly, y=8 at T=42 only.\n\nBut at t=40, y=7 is free.\n\nIn the car list, for y=7, only one car, which is at x=0 only at T=42.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps I should write the free times.\n\nFor each freeway, the times when it is safe to be on.\n\nBut since I need to move, I have to consider the path.\n\nAnother point: when I am on a freeway, I must avoid the occupied times.\n\nIn this case, with two U actions, it works.\n\nBut let me see the answer format.\n\nPerhaps I need to output the actions.\n\nBut the problem says \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence\".\n\nIn this case H=2.\n\nBut let me confirm with the times.\n\nt_1=40.\n\nActions: turn 40: a_{40}, turn 41: a_{41}\n\nThen y_{42}=9.\n\nNow, at turn 40: position y=7, action U, so y_{41}=8\n\nAt turn 41: position y=8, action U, y_{42}=9\n\nCollision check:\n\nAt turn 40: on y=7, cars on y=7: occupied at T=42, not 40, so no collision.\n\nAt turn 41: on y=8, cars on y=8: occupied at T=42, not 41, so no collision.\n\nAt turn 42: on y=9, no freeway, no collision.\n\nSo yes.\n\nBut is there a car at T=40 for other y? But I'm not on them.\n\nFor example, y=1 to 6 have occupations, but I'm not there.\n\ny=5 has occupation at T=40 and 44, but I'm on y=7.\n\nSo fine.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if I need to go through other rows, but no need, since I can go directly.\n\nBut let me see the time t=42.\n\nAt t=42, y=7 and y=8 are occupied, but I am at y=9.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nPerhaps the player cannot be on y=7 at t=42, but I am not.\n\nSo I think it's ok.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), and with two actions, I can.\n\nBut let me see if there is a constraint I missed.\n\nAnother thing: the car on freeway 6, for example, at T=49 to 52, but that's later, not relevant.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nPerhaps at t=40, I could go down, but that would take longer.\n\nFor example, if I go down to y=6, but y=6 is occupied at T=49-52, but at t=40, y=6 might be safe, but going down is away from goal.\n\nNot efficient.\n\nSimilarly, staying is inefficient.\n\nSo minimal H=2 with U,U.\n\nBut let me check the initial position.\n\nPlayer at (0,7), which is on freeway 7.\n\nAt t=40, freeway 7 is safe, as per above.\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 7, car at (-48,-71,right,24), at T=40, Δt=0, span: [-71, -48]? τ=-71, h=-48, so [ -71 +24*0, -48 +24*0] = [-71,-48], all negative, 0 not in, so yes, safe.\n\nSimilarly, at t=41, on y=8, freeway 8 same car? No, freeway 8 has separate car, but same state, at T=41, Δt=1, span: [-71 +24*1, -48 +24*1] = [-47, -24], still negative, 0 not in, so safe.\n\nThen at t=42, if I were on y=8, span: [-71+48, -48+48] = [-23,0], 0 included, collision, but I am at y=9, not on y=8.\n\nSo all good.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=2, actions: turn 40: U, turn 41: U.\n\nBut in the sequence, it should be from t=40 to t=41.\n\nAnswer format:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 40: U\nTurn 41: U\n}\n\nBut let me write it properly.\n\nThe turn is t_1=40, so:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} = U\n\nTurn t_1 +1: a_{t_1 +1} = U\n\nAnd H=2.\n\nBut in the sequence, it says {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}, so for t from 0 to H-1.\n\nt=0: a_{t_1 +0} = a_{40}\n\nt=1: a_{t_1 +1} = a_{41}\n\nThen after H=2 actions, at turn t_1 + H =42, y=9.\n\nYes.\n\nSo I think that's the answer.\n\nBut the problem might be tricky, and I missed something.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 7 and 8, at t=42 occupied, but I am not there.\n\nAnother point: when I move from y=7 to y=8 at turn t=40, at that turn, I am on y=7, and after action, I move to y=8 for next turn.\n\nThe collision is only at the current position at current time.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n\nPerhaps the cars are on different freeways, but I think I covered.\n\nTo be thorough, let's list all occupied times for reference:\n\ny=1: occ at 40,41,42,50,51,52\n\ny=2: same\n\ny=3: 40,45,46\n\ny=4: same\n\ny=5: 40,44\n\ny=6: 49,50,51,52\n\ny=7: 42\n\ny=8: 42\n\nIn my path, I am on y=7 at t=40 (safe), y=8 at t=41 (safe), then y=9 at t=42.\n\nNo conflict.\n\nIf I had to be on y=7 at t=42, it would be occupied, but I am not.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=2 with actions U at t=40 and U at t=41.\n</think>\nThe goal is to reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 7) at turn \\(t_1 = 40\\) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis\n- The player starts at \\(y = 7\\) at turn 40.\n- From \\(y = 7\\), moving directly up to \\(y = 8\\) and then to \\(y = 9\\) requires 2 actions (minimal \\(H = 2\\) since each action changes \\(y\\) by at most 1).\n- Collision avoidance:\n  - At turn 40: Player is on freeway \\(y = 7\\). Freeway 7 is occupied at \\(x = 0\\) only at turn 42 (from car state analysis). Since turn 40 is not occupied, no collision occurs. Action \\(U\\) moves player to \\(y = 8\\) for turn 41.\n  - At turn 41: Player is on freeway \\(y = 8\\). Freeway 8 is occupied at \\(x = 0\\) only at turn 42 (from car state analysis). Since turn 41 is not occupied, no collision occurs. Action \\(U\\) moves player to \\(y = 9\\) for turn 42.\n  - At turn 42: Player is at \\(y = 9\\), which is not a freeway, so no collision check is needed, and the goal is reached.\n- Occupancy details for relevant freeways (derived from car states at \\(t_1 = 40\\)):\n  - Freeway 7: Occupied only at turn 42.\n  - Freeway 8: Occupied only at turn 42.\n- Other freeways (not visited) have occupancies at different times, but since the player only occupies \\(y = 7\\) and \\(y = 8\\) at turns 40 and 41 respectively (both safe), there are no issues.\n\nThus, the sequence of actions to reach (0, 9) in \\(H = 2\\) turns is:\n- Turn 40: \\(U\\) (move up to \\(y = 8\\))\n- Turn 41: \\(U\\) (move up to \\(y = 9\\))\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 40: U \\\\\nTurn 41: U\n}",
