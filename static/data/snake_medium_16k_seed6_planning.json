        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 0, and the snake is at position (3,3) with direction left. That means the head is at (3,3), and since it's a single segment, the tail is also at (3,3). The snake positions list has only one element, so the snake is just the head, no body yet.\n\nThe grid has walls. Border cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7), with walls on the borders. Also, internal obstacles at (3,2), (4,5), (3,6), (3,1), and (2,2). So those cells are blocked.\n\nFood items:\n\n- (5,3) with life span 10, value +1 (positive food)\n\n- (4,1) with life span 10, value +1\n\n- (1,6) with life span 10, value +1\n\nAll food is positive, no negative food mentioned. Value is 1 for all, and life span 10.\n\nSince the snake has only one segment, eating any food will make it grow to length 2. But I need to be careful about the tail reward danger, but since there's no tail yet, that shouldn't be an issue immediately.\n\nHead direction is left, so from (3,3), moving left would go to (2,3). But (2,2) is an obstacle, but (2,3) is not listed as an obstacle. Obstacles are (3,2), (4,5), (3,6), (3,1), (2,2). So (2,3) is free? Let me list all blocked cells.\n\nWalls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So cells like (0,y) for all y, (7,y) for all y, (x,0) for all x, (x,7) for all x.\n\nInternal obstacles: (3,2), (4,5), (3,6), (3,1), (2,2).\n\nSo (2,3) is not an obstacle, so it should be free.\n\nSimilarly, other directions: up to (3,4), down to (3,2) but (3,2) is obstacle, so can't go down. Right to (4,3), no obstacle mentioned, so free.\n\nCurrent position: (3,3)\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- Up: (3,4) - y increases, so from (3,3) to (3,4)\n\n- Down: (3,2) - but (3,2) is obstacle, so invalid\n\n- Left: (2,3) - no obstacle, should be free\n\n- Right: (4,3) - no obstacle mentioned, so free\n\nHead direction is left, so I can move left, up, down, or right, but down is blocked by obstacle, so only up, left, right are possible. And no instant reverse: since current direction is left, reverse would be right, but it's not instant reverse because I can change direction, I just can't go directly opposite in the next turn. The rule says: \"Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\" So for turn 0, since head direction is left, I cannot move right on this turn because that would be opposite.\n\nHead direction is given as L, left. So current direction is left.\n\nOn the next move, I cannot move opposite to current direction, so I cannot move right immediately.\n\nPossible moves: not opposite, so I can move up, down, or left. But down is blocked, so only up or left are possible? Let's confirm.\n\nFrom (3,3):\n\n- Move left: to (2,3) - not opposite to current (left), same direction is allowed? The rule says \"no instant reverse\", meaning cannot move opposite, but moving same direction is fine.\n\nCurrent direction is left, so:\n\n- Moving left: same direction, allowed\n\n- Moving up: perpendicular, allowed\n\n- Moving down: perpendicular, but blocked by obstacle\n\n- Moving right: opposite, not allowed\n\nSo for turn 0, I can only move left or up.\n\nDown is blocked, so only choices: left to (2,3) or up to (3,4).\n\nNow, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n\nFirst, let's map the grid.\n\nGrid size: 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7). (0,0) is bottom-left? Usually in coordinates, but in grid, it might be different. Since y=0 and y=7 are walls, and no specification, I'll assume (0,0) is bottom-left, so y increases up, x increases right. But in the move, U is (x,y+1), so y+1 is up, so (0,0) is bottom-left, (7,7) top-right. But walls are at y=0 and y=7, so rows 0 and 7 are walls.\n\nSimilarly, x=0 and x=7 are walls.\n\nInternal obstacles: (3,2), (4,5), (3,6), (3,1), (2,2)\n\nFood at: (5,3), (4,1), (1,6)\n\nSnake at (3,3), head.\n\nI need to plan multiple turns.\n\nFirst, since snake is length 1, eating any food will make it grow. But I have to reach the food.\n\nAlso, food has life span, but all have life span 10, and it's turn 0, so they disappear after 10 turns, including this one, I think. \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so at turn 0, life span 10, after this turn, it becomes 9, and so on, until 0, then disappears.\n\nBut since we start at turn 0, and life span 10, it will disappear at the end of turn 9 or something? Let's see: at turn t, food has life span N, it will disappear after N turns, meaning after turn t + N - 1 or something? I need to clarify.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo, for example, at turn t, if life span is N, after this turn, it decreases to N-1, and when it reaches 0, it disappears before the next turn or after? It says \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nSuppose at turn t, food is present with life span L.\n\nAfter turn t is executed, countdown decreases by 1, so at start of turn t+1, it has life span L-1.\n\nIf at start of turn, life span is 0, it disappears before that turn.\n\nBut the rule says: \"disappears after N turns\", meaning it exists for N turns starting from when it was spawned.\n\nIn this case, at turn 0, life span 10, so it should disappear after 10 turns, meaning it exists until turn 9, and at turn 10 it is gone.\n\n\"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" so at turn 0, countdown is 10, after turn 0, it becomes 9, and so on, down to 0. When countdown reaches 0, it disappears before the next action or after the action? I think it's similar to how it's handled in games.\n\nTypically, the food is present during the turn when countdown >0, and after the action, if head eats it, it's consumed, else countdown decreases.\n\nThe rule doesn't specify exactly, but I think for simplicity, we can assume that at the beginning of each turn, food with life span >0 is present, and after the snake moves, if head is on food, it eats it, and then the life span decreases for all food.\n\nBut the rule says: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" and \"disappears after N turns\".\n\nTo avoid confusion, let's assume that for a food with life span L at turn t:\n\n- It is present during turn t.\n\n- After the snake moves on turn t, if head is on it, it is eaten.\n\n- Then, after that, life span decreases by 1 for all food that wasn't eaten.\n\n- If life span becomes 0, it disappears before the next turn.\n\nIn this case, at turn 0, life span 10, so it will be present for turns 0 to 9, and disappear at turn 10.\n\nSimilarly, eaten during turn if head moves to it.\n\nBut for planning, since life span is long (10 turns), and grid is small, it might not disappear soon, so I can consider them available for now.\n\nBack to current choices.\n\nAt turn 0, I can move to (2,3) left or (3,4) up.\n\nNow, let's see the food positions.\n\n(5,3) is at x=5,y=3, which is to the right of current (3,3), but since I can't move right directly, I have to go around.\n\n(4,1) is down-left, but (4,1) is near obstacles.\n\n(1,6) is left-up.\n\nAlso, internal obstacles block some paths.\n\nFirst, if I move left to (2,3), then snake will be at (2,3), and since it eats no food, length still 1.\n\nThen from there, possible moves: head at (2,3), direction from left move, so direction is left? After moving, the head direction is the direction I just moved.\n\nAfter moving, the new head direction is set to the move direction.\n\nSo if I move left to (2,3), new head direction is left.\n\nThen from (2,3), possible moves: not opposite to left, so cannot move right. Can move up, down, left.\n\nCells: up to (2,4), down to (2,2), left to (1,3).\n\n(2,2) is obstacle, so down blocked. So can move up or left.\n\nSimilarly, if I move up to (3,4), new head direction up, then from there can move up, left, right, not down.\n\nNow, let's think about getting to food.\n\nFood at (5,3): from (3,3), I need to go right, but can't directly. So I have to go up or left first, then later go right.\n\nBut moving left might make it harder to reach (5,3).\n\n(4,1) is at (4,1), which is down from (3,3), but (3,2) is obstacle, so I can't go down directly. To reach (4,1), I need to go around obstacles.\n\nSimilarly, (1,6) is at (1,6), which is up-left.\n\nSince head direction is left, moving left might be natural to go towards (1,6).\n\nBut let's see the obstacles.\n\nList all blocked cells to avoid:\n\nWalls: all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls.\n\nInternal: (3,2), (4,5), (3,6), (3,1), (2,2)\n\nSo (2,2) is internal obstacle, but (2,2) is at x=2,y=2, which is not border, so it's an internal wall.\n\nSimilarly, (3,1), (3,2), (3,6), (4,5).\n\nNow, food at (5,3), (4,1), (1,6)\n\n(4,1): x=4,y=1. y=1, not y=0, so not wall, but is it obstacle? Internal obstacles include (3,1), (3,2), etc., (4,1) is not listed, so it should be free.\n\nSimilarly, (5,3) not listed, free.\n\n(1,6) not listed, free.\n\nBut (3,6) is obstacle, so (1,6) is free.\n\nNow, from (3,3), I can:\n\nOption 1: Move left to (2,3)\n\nThen snake at (2,3), head direction left.\n\nNow, from (2,3), can move up to (2,4) or left to (1,3) (since down to (2,2) blocked).\n\nIf move left to (1,3), then at (1,3), direction left.\n\nThen from (1,3), can move up, down, left (not right, opposite).\n\nLeft to (0,3) but x=0 is wall, so invalid. Down to (1,2), is it free? y=2, x=1, not border, internal obstacles: (2,2) but not (1,2), so (1,2) free? (1,2) not listed as obstacle, so free. But (1,2) might be near (2,2), but not same cell.\n\nSimilarly, up to (1,4), free.\n\nSo from (1,3), can move up to (1,4), down to (1,2), or left but left to (0,3) wall, so only up or down.\n\nBut food at (1,6) is at y=6, so I need to go up.\n\nFrom (1,3), move up to (1,4), then to (1,5), then to (1,6) to eat food, but at (1,6), it's food, so if I reach there, I eat it.\n\nBut let's see how many moves.\n\nFrom (3,3) to (2,3) turn 0.\n\nThen from (2,3) to (1,3) turn 1.\n\nThen from (1,3) to (1,4) turn 2? But at turn 1, at (1,3), then turn 2 move to (1,4), turn 3 to (1,5), turn 4 to (1,6). So at turn 4, I can eat (1,6) if I go directly up.\n\nBut from (1,3), I can also go down, but that might not be towards food.\n\nAfter eating at (1,6), snake grows to length 2, so positions: head at (1,6), tail at previous position, which was before eating.\n\nWhen I eat food, I grow after moving, so when head moves to food cell, it eats, then the tail doesn't move, so snake grows by one.\n\nAt turn 4, head moves to (1,6), which has food, so eats it, snake now has two segments: head at (1,6), tail at (1,5) or wherever it came from.\n\nIn this case, from (1,5) to (1,6), so after eating, head at (1,6), tail at (1,5).\n\nThen from there, I can move, but need to avoid colliding with body.\n\nBut for now, this is one path.\n\nBut (1,6) has life span 10, so it will be there for a while.\n\nNow, other food: (5,3) and (4,1).\n\n(4,1) is at (4,1), which is south-east from current position.\n\nTo reach it from (3,3), I need to go down, but (3,2) is obstacle, so I have to go around.\n\nFor example, go right or up first.\n\nBut currently, I can only move left or up.\n\nIf I move up to (3,4) at turn 0.\n\nThen from (3,4), head direction up, so can move up, left, right (not down).\n\nCells: up to (3,5), but (3,6) is obstacle, so (3,5) should be free? (3,5) not listed, so free.\n\nLeft to (2,4), free.\n\nRight to (4,4), free.\n\nDown is opposite, not allowed.\n\nSo from (3,4), can go to (3,5), (2,4), or (4,4).\n\n(4,4) is towards (5,3), but (5,3) is at y=3, so I need to go down later.\n\nBut there are obstacles.\n\nAlso, (4,1) is at y=1, so I need to go down.\n\nLet's think about the grid layout.\n\nI should consider the available space and plan a route to collect food safely.\n\nSince the snake is short, I can go for the closest food.\n\nBut (5,3) is at distance |5-3| + |3-3| = 2 in Manhattan, but I can't go directly right.\n\nFrom (3,3), to (5,3), I need to go right twice, but can't because of direction and obstacle? No obstacle directly, but I can't move right because opposite direction.\n\nSo I have to go up or left first, then later go right.\n\nSimilarly, (4,1): Manhattan distance |4-3| + |1-3| = 1 + 2 = 3, but with obstacles.\n\n(1,6): |1-3| + |6-3| = 2 + 3 = 5.\n\nSo (5,3) is closest in theory but not directly reachable.\n\n(4,1) is 3 cells away, (1,6) is 5.\n\nBut due to obstacles, paths might be longer.\n\nFor example, to (4,1): from (3,3), I can go left to (2,3), then down to? (2,2) obstacle, so can't go down from (2,3). From (2,3), I can go left to (1,3) or up to (2,4).\n\nIf I go to (1,3), then from (1,3) I can go down to (1,2), then to (1,1), then to (2,1), but (2,1) is free? x=2,y=1, not border, not internal obstacle (internal are (3,1), etc., not (2,1)), so free.\n\nThen from (2,1) to (3,1), but (3,1) is obstacle! Internal obstacle at (3,1), so (3,1) blocked.\n\nFrom (2,1), I can go to (2,0) but y=0 wall, or to (1,1) or (3,1) but (3,1) blocked, or to (2,2) but (2,2) obstacle.\n\nFrom (2,1), possible moves: up to (2,2) obstacle, down to (2,0) wall, left to (1,1), right to (3,1) obstacle. So only left to (1,1).\n\nSimilarly, (1,1) to (1,0) wall, (1,2), (0,1) wall, (2,1) but came from, so only to (1,2) or other.\n\nBut to reach (4,1), it's messy.\n\nFrom (3,3), go up to (3,4), then right to (4,4), then down to (4,3), but (4,3) is free, then from (4,3) to (4,2), but (4,2) free? Then to (4,1), but (4,1) is food.\n\nLet's sequence:\n\nTurn 0: move up to (3,4)\n\nTurn 1: from (3,4), head direction up, can move right to (4,4) (not opposite, perpendicular)\n\nTurn 2: at (4,4), head direction right (since moved right), can move down to (4,3) (perpendicular), or right to (5,4), etc., not left.\n\nMove down to (4,3)\n\nThen at (4,3), head direction down, can move down to (4,2), left to (3,3) but (3,3) was previous position, but snake is moving, so positions: after turn 2, head at (4,3), and if no food eaten, snake still length 1, so tail at (4,3) as well? No, when snake moves, the tail follows or stays?\n\nSince length 1, when head moves to new cell, the tail was at old position, but since only one segment, after move, head at new position, and no tail, so still length 1.\n\nAfter moving to (4,3), snake position is [(4,3)], no body.\n\nThen from (4,3), move down to (4,2) turn 3.\n\nThen to (4,1) turn 4, eat food.\n\nSo in 4 turns, I can eat (4,1).\n\nSimilarly, for (1,6), as earlier, in 4 turns via left and up.\n\nFor (5,3): from (3,3), if I could go right, but can't. From (3,4), I can go right to (4,4), then down to (4,3), then right to (5,3).\n\nFrom (4,3) to (5,3) is right.\n\nSequence: start at (3,3)\n\nTurn 0: move up to (3,4)\n\nTurn 1: move right to (4,4)\n\nTurn 2: move down to (4,3)  // at (4,3), not food yet\n\n(4,3) is not food, food at (5,3)\n\nThen turn 3: from (4,3), head direction down (from previous move down), can move down, left, right? Not up, opposite.\n\nMove right to (5,3), eat food.\n\nSo turn 3 eat (5,3).\n\nSimilarly, from (3,3) move left to (2,3) turn 0, then up to (2,4) turn 1, then right to (3,4) turn 2, then right to (4,4) turn 3, then down to (4,3) turn 4, then to (5,3) turn 5, longer.\n\nOr from (2,3) to (1,3) to (1,4) etc. to (1,6) or other.\n\nBut to (5,3), the up then right then down then right is shorter, 3 turns to eat.\n\nIn that sequence, eat at turn 3.\n\nSimilarly for (4,1), 4 turns.\n\nFor (1,6), 4 turns if go left then up.\n\nBut all have life span 10, so no urgency.\n\nNow, I need to think long-term survival and maximize score.\n\nAlso, after eating, snake grows, and I need to avoid collisions.\n\nBut currently no body.\n\nAnother thing: tail reward danger, but not applicable yet.\n\nNow, let's see which food to target first.\n\n(5,3) is closest in terms of turns: 3 turns via up-right-down-right.\n\n(4,1) is 4 turns via up-right-down-down.\n\n(1,6) is 4 turns via left-left-up-up-up or something.\n\nBut let's confirm the path to (1,6).\n\nFrom (3,3) move left to (2,3) turn 0.\n\nThen to (1,3) turn 1 (move left).\n\nThen to (1,4) turn 2 (move up).\n\nThen to (1,5) turn 3 (move up).\n\nThen to (1,6) turn 4 (move up and eat).\n\nYes, 4 turns.\n\nSimilarly, to (4,1): from (3,3) move up to (3,4) turn 0.\n\nThen to (4,4) turn 1 (right).\n\nThen to (4,3) turn 2 (down).\n\nThen to (4,2) turn 3 (down).\n\n(4,2) is not food, food at (4,1), so turn 4 to (4,1) eat.\n\nFrom (4,3) to (4,2) to (4,1).\n\nYes.\n\n(4,2) free? x=4,y=2, not border, not internal obstacle (internal: (3,2) but not (4,2)), so yes.\n\nNow, for (5,3): from (3,3) move up to (3,4) turn 0.\n\nTurn 1: to (4,4) right.\n\nTurn 2: to (4,3) down.\n\nTurn 3: to (5,3) right and eat.\n\nYes, 3 turns.\n\nSo (5,3) can be eaten in 3 turns, others in 4.\n\nBut to eat (5,3), I need to move up first at turn 0.\n\nIf I move left, I can't reach (5,3) quickly.\n\nBut moving left, I can go for (1,6).\n\nBut (1,6) takes 4 turns, same as (4,1), but (5,3) is faster.\n\nMoreover, after eating (5,3), snake grows to length 2, and I am at (5,3), which is near the right side.\n\nThen I can go for other food.\n\nSimilarly, (4,1) is near.\n\nBut let's think about the obstacles.\n\nInternal obstacles: (3,2), (3,1), (2,2), (3,6), (4,5)\n\n(4,5) is at (4,5), which might block some paths.\n\nAlso, (3,6) at (3,6), y=6.\n\nNow, if I go to (5,3) first, by moving up at turn 0.\n\nThen after eating at turn 3, snake at (5,3) with tail at (4,3)? When I eat at (5,3), head moves to (5,3), and since it ate, the tail doesn't move, so previous position becomes body.\n\nBefore eating, at turn 2, head at (4,3), snake length 1, so positions: [(4,3)]\n\nMove to (5,3) turn 3, head to (5,3), and since (5,3) has food, eat it, so snake grows to length 2: head at (5,3), body at (4,3).\n\nThen head direction is right (since moved right).\n\nNow, from (5,3), can move up, down, right (not left, opposite).\n\nCells: up to (5,4), down to (5,2), right to (6,3).\n\n(5,2): y=2, not wall, not obstacle? Obstacles: (3,2) but not (5,2), so free.\n\n(5,4) free.\n\n(6,3) free, but x=6, not 7, so not wall.\n\nThen I can go to other food, like (4,1) or (1,6).\n\n(4,1) is at (4,1), from (5,3), I can go down to (5,2), then left to (4,2), then down to (4,1).\n\nBut (4,2) to (4,1) down.\n\nSequence: turn 3 at (5,3) after eat.\n\nTurn 4: move down to (5,2)\n\nThen head at (5,2), tail at (4,3)? Positions: head moves to (5,2), tail moves to previous head position? When snake moves without eating, head moves to new cell, tail moves to next, but since length 2, after move, head at new, tail at old head.\n\nAfter eating at turn 3: positions [(5,3), (4,3)] head at (5,3), body at (4,3)\n\nTurn 4: move down to (5,2), so head to (5,2), and since no food, tail moves to where head was? Tail moves to the position that was head, but in list, the body segment follows.\n\nAfter move, head at (5,2), body at (5,3)? Let's think.\n\nBefore move, positions: index 0: head (5,3), index 1: body (4,3)\n\nAfter moving head down to (5,2), the body moves to the previous head position, so new positions: head (5,2), body (5,3)\n\nThen snake is at [(5,2), (5,3)] head at (5,2), direction down.\n\nThen from (5,2), can move down, left, right (not up, opposite).\n\nDown to (5,1), left to (4,2), right to (6,2).\n\n(5,1) free? y=1, not wall.\n\nThen to (4,1): move left to (4,2) turn 4? Turn 4: from (5,2) move left to (4,2)\n\nThen at (4,2), head direction left, positions: head (4,2), body (5,2) since tail moved to (5,2)\n\nThen turn 5: move down to (4,1) and eat, since (4,1) has food.\n\nAfter eating, head at (4,1), snake grows, so positions: head (4,1), body (4,2), and new tail? After eating, tail doesn't move, so body stays, head moves to food, so positions: before move, head at (4,2), body at (5,2) for turn 4 end.\n\nTurn 4 end: positions [(4,2), (5,2)] head (4,2)\n\nMove to (4,1) turn 5, head to (4,1), which has food, eat, so tail doesn't move, so new positions: head (4,1), and the body (4,2), and since grew, the tail remains, so segments: head (4,1), body (4,2), and the previous body becomes tail, but in list, it should be [head, body, tail], so [(4,1), (4,2), (5,2)]? Let's clarify.\n\nBefore move at turn 5 start: positions [(4,2), (5,2)] with (4,2) head.\n\nAfter moving to (4,1): head moves to (4,1), and since it eats food, the tail does not move, so the body segment remains at (5,2), and a new segment is added at the tail position? No.\n\nStandard snake: when head eats food, it grows, so the tail stays in place, meaning the body doesn't advance.\n\nSo positions: before move, snake has segments S0 (head), S1, ..., Sk (tail).\n\nAfter move, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to previous position of the segment before it.\n\nIf head moves to food, then after moving, the tail segment does not move; instead, a new segment is added at the end, so the tail stays, and the snake grows.\n\nIn terms of positions: after head moves to new cell, if no eat, all segments shift, tail is removed.\n\nIf eat, all segments shift, but tail is not removed, so snake length increases by one.\n\nIn this case, before move, positions: [P0, P1, ..., Pk] with P0 head.\n\nAfter move to new head position N:\n\n- New head at N\n\n- Body segments: P0 becomes new segment 1, P1 becomes segment 2, ..., P_{k-1} becomes segment k, and Pk remains as segment k+1? No.\n\nStandard: the segment that was head becomes body, and so on.\n\nAfter move:\n\n- The new head is at the new position N.\n\n- The segment that was at position i moves to position i-1 for i=1 to k, so the new segment 1 is the old head position, segment 2 is old segment 1 position, ..., segment k is old segment k-1 position, and the old tail position is left, but if not eating, it is removed.\n\nIf eating, the old tail position is not removed, so it becomes the new tail, and there is a new body segment at the position where the tail was.\n\nPerhaps it's better to think in terms of the list.\n\nBefore move: positions list [H, B1, B2, ..., T] where H is head, T is tail.\n\nAfter moving head to new position N:\n\n- New head: N\n\n- New body: the previous positions: H becomes new B1, B1 becomes new B2, ..., B_{k-1} becomes new Bk, and T is still there, but if not eating, T is removed, so new positions [N, H, B1, B2, ..., B_{k-1}]\n\nIf eating, T is not removed, so new positions [N, H, B1, B2, ..., B_{k-1}, T]\n\nBut T is the tail, so it stays.\n\nIn this case, for length 2: before move, [H, T]\n\nAfter move to N, if no eat: new [N, H] , tail moved to H.\n\nIf eat: new [N, H, T] , so length 3, with head N, body H, tail T.\n\nSimilarly for longer snakes.\n\nIn our case, when eating at (5,3): before move, at turn 3 start, positions [(4,3)] only head, length 1.\n\nMove to (5,3), eat, so after, positions [(5,3), (4,3)] head (5,3), body (4,3)\n\nThen later, when moving from (5,3) to (5,2), no eat, so positions become [(5,2), (5,3)] head (5,2), body (5,3)\n\nThen to (4,2), no eat, positions [(4,2), (5,2)]\n\nThen to (4,1), eat, so before move positions [(4,2), (5,2)]\n\nMove to (4,1), eat, so new positions [(4,1), (4,2), (5,2)] head (4,1), body (4,2), tail (5,2)\n\nEtc.\n\nBack to planning.\n\nIf I go for (5,3) first by moving up at turn 0.\n\nThen I can eat (4,1) by turn 5 as above.\n\nThen (1,6) is still there.\n\nBut after eating (4,1), I am at (4,1), with snake length 3 or something.\n\nBut there might be risks.\n\nIf I go for (1,6) first, by moving left at turn 0.\n\nTurn 0: move left to (2,3)\n\nThen turn 1: move left to (1,3)\n\nThen turn 2: move up to (1,4)\n\nTurn 3: move up to (1,5)\n\nTurn 4: move up to (1,6) eat.\n\nAfter eat, positions: before move, at turn 4 start, positions [(1,5)] only, since length 1 until eat.\n\nAfter move to (1,6) eat, positions [(1,6), (1,5)] head (1,6), body (1,5)\n\nThen from (1,6), head direction up, can move up, left, right (not down).\n\nUp to (1,7) but y=7 wall, invalid.\n\nLeft to (0,6) x=0 wall, invalid.\n\nRight to (2,6), which is free? (2,6) not obstacle.\n\n(3,6) is obstacle, but (2,6) free.\n\nSo can move right to (2,6).\n\nThen from there, I can go to other food.\n\nBut (5,3) is far, and (4,1) might be eaten later.\n\nBut life span 10, so turn 4 is still early.\n\nTurn 0 to turn 4, life span decreases to 6 for all food? At turn 0, life span 10.\n\nAfter turn 0, life span 9 for all.\n\nAfter turn 1, 8, etc.\n\nAfter turn 4, when I eat (1,6), life span has decreased 4 times, so 10-4=6 left, but since I eat it, it's fine.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut if I go for (1,6) first, I might not get to (5,3) quickly.\n\n(5,3) is only 3 turns away if I move up first.\n\nWhereas if I move left, (5,3) takes more turns.\n\nAlso, there is the food at (4,1), which I can eat on the way.\n\nAnother thing: the special case about food under body, but since no body now, not issue.\n\nTail reward danger: when head adjacent to tail and tail cell has food, but tail moves, so if head moves to where tail was, it might be safe, but the rule says: \"if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because head and newly grown tail collide.\"\n\nBut in this case, since tail moves, when head moves to a cell, if that cell was the tail, and it has food, but after head moves, the tail moves away, so the food is eaten, but the new tail is grown at the previous tail position? Let's read carefully.\n\n\"Tail Reward Danger: If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n\nSuppose head is adjacent to tail, meaning next to it, and the cell where the tail is has food on it.\n\nIf the head moves to that tail cell, it eats the food, and since it eats, the snake grows, so the tail does not move; it stays, but the head is now on the tail cell, so they are on the same cell, collision? Or the tail is still there, head moves to it.\n\nWhen head moves to the tail cell, which has food.\n\nAfter moving, head is at the tail cell, and since it eats food, the tail does not move, so the tail segment is still at that cell? But head and tail on same cell, collision.\n\nThe rule says: \"the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n\nAfter eating, the snake grows, so a new segment is added, but the positions: before move, head at H, tail at T, and T has food.\n\nHead moves to T, eats food, so new head at T.\n\nSince ate, tail does not move, so the old tail position T now has the head, and the body segments adjust.\n\nThe segment that was tail remains at T, and head moves to T, so they are on the same cell, which is a collision.\n\nTherefore, it is deadly.\n\nIf head moves to a cell that is not the tail, but has food, it's fine.\n\nBut if it moves to the tail cell when it has food, it collides.\n\nIn this case, since the tail moves only if not eating, but when eating, tail stays.\n\nSo to avoid, if the head is adjacent to tail, and the tail cell has food, do not move to it.\n\nOtherwise, it's safe.\n\nBut for now, snake length 1, no tail, so no issue.\n\nBack to decision.\n\nI think moving up to (3,4) at turn 0 is better, because it allows me to reach (5,3) faster and then (4,1).\n\nThen (1,6) can be targeted later.\n\nMoreover, (1,6) is near the corner, which might be risky when snake is longer.\n\nSimilarly, (4,1) is near bottom.\n\nBut let's see the grid.\n\nGrid: rows y=0 to 7, columns x=0 to 7.\n\nWalls at borders.\n\nInternal obstacles at (3,2), (4,5), (3,6), (3,1), (2,2)\n\n(3,1) and (3,2) block the bottom middle.\n\n(2,2) bottom-left area.\n\n(4,5) and (3,6) top-middle.\n\nFood at (5,3) center-right, (4,1) bottom-center, (1,6) top-left.\n\nFrom (3,3), moving up to (3,4) opens the path to right.\n\nMoving left to (2,3) goes towards left, which has obstacles and corner.\n\nSo probably moving up is better for long-term.\n\nI need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n\nSuppose I move up at turn 0 to (3,4).\n\nThen turn 1: move right to (4,4)  (since from (3,4), direction up, can move right)\n\nTurn 2: move down to (4,3)  (direction right, move down)\n\nAt (4,3), no food, so snake still length 1.\n\nThen turn 3: move right to (5,3) eat.\n\nNow snake at [(5,3), (4,3)] head (5,3), direction right.\n\nNow turn 4: from (5,3), can move down to (5,2), or up to (5,4), or right to (6,3) (not left, opposite).\n\nNow, to go to (4,1), move down to (5,2).\n\nTurn 4: move down to (5,2)\n\nPositions: head (5,2), body (5,3)  // since from [(5,3),(4,3)] move to (5,2), no eat, so new positions [(5,2), (5,3)] head (5,2), direction down.\n\nThen turn 5: move left to (4,2)  (not up, opposite; can move down, left, right)\n\nMove left to (4,2)\n\nHead at (4,2), body at (5,2)\n\nDirection left.\n\nThen turn 6: move down to (4,1) eat.\n\nAt (4,1) eat, so positions: before move [(4,2),(5,2)], move to (4,1) eat, so new positions [(4,1), (4,2), (5,2)] head (4,1), body (4,2), tail (5,2)\n\nNow, after that, I need to go to (1,6).\n\nBut (1,6) is at top-left, and I am at (4,1) bottom.\n\nAlso, there might be other food later, but for now, only three food.\n\nLife span 10, so at turn 6, life span decreased 6 times, so 4 left? From turn 0 to turn 6, 7 actions? Turns: turn 0,1,2,3,4,5,6: 7 turns.\n\nLife span: at turn 0, L=10.\n\nAfter turn 0, L=9\n\nAfter turn 1, L=8\n\n...\n\nAfter turn 6, L=4, so still 4 turns left for food, but since I eat (1,6) at some point, it should be ok.\n\nNow from (4,1), with snake length 3, I need to go to (1,6).\n\nPath: from (4,1), head at (4,1), direction down (since moved down to (4,1)? After moving down to (4,1), head direction down.\n\nCan move down, left, right (not up, opposite).\n\nDown to (4,0) but y=0 wall, invalid.\n\nLeft to (3,1), but (3,1) is obstacle, invalid.\n\nRight to (5,1), free.\n\nSo only right to (5,1).\n\nMove to (5,1).\n\nThen from (5,1), direction right? After move to (5,1), head direction right (since moved right from (4,1)? From (4,1) move right to (5,1), so direction right.\n\nCan move up, down, right (not left).\n\nUp to (5,2), but (5,2) is the tail? Positions: before move, [(4,1),(4,2),(5,2)]\n\nAfter move to (5,1), no eat, so new positions: head (5,1), body (4,1), tail (4,2)? Let's see: old head (4,1) becomes body, old body (4,2) becomes tail, new head (5,1).\n\nSo positions [(5,1), (4,1), (4,2)]\n\nHead at (5,1), body at (4,1), tail at (4,2)\n\nNow from (5,1), direction right, can move up to (5,2), down to (5,0) wall, right to (6,1), not left.\n\n(5,2) is occupied by tail? (5,2) is not in positions; positions are (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), so (5,2) is free.\n\nBut (4,2) is body, not (5,2).\n\n(5,2) is empty.\n\nSimilarly, (6,1) free.\n\nI can move up to (5,2), then to (5,3), etc.\n\nBut to go to (1,6), I need to go left and up.\n\nFrom (5,1), move up to (5,2)\n\nThen to (5,3), but (5,3) might be free, but I need to avoid body.\n\nAt (5,2), positions after move: from (5,1) move up to (5,2), no eat, so new positions: head (5,2), body (5,1), tail (4,1)? Old head (5,1) becomes body, old body (4,1) becomes tail, new head (5,2).\n\nPositions [(5,2), (5,1), (4,1)]\n\nThen from (5,2), direction up, can move up to (5,3), left to (4,2), right to (6,2), not down.\n\n(4,2) is tail? Positions: (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), so (4,2) is free? (4,2) not occupied.\n\nEarlier tail was (4,1), not (4,2).\n\n(4,2) is free.\n\nBut I can move to (5,3) or (4,2).\n\nTo go left, move left to (4,2).\n\nThen to (3,2) but (3,2) obstacle, so can't.\n\nFrom (4,2), can move up or left, but left to (3,2) obstacle.\n\nSo need to go around.\n\nThis might be inefficient.\n\nSince there is obstacle at (3,2) and (3,1), the bottom row is blocked between x=2 to x=3 or something.\n\nTo reach (1,6) from bottom, I need to go up first.\n\nFor example, from current position after eating (4,1), at (4,1), I moved to (5,1), then to (5,2), then to (5,3), but (5,3) was previous head, but now free.\n\nAt (5,3), I can go left to (4,3), etc.\n\nBut to go to (1,6), I need to go left to x=1, but at y=1 and y=2, there are obstacles, so I have to go to higher y.\n\nFor example, go to y=4 or above.\n\nFrom (5,3), move left to (4,3), but (4,3) might be free.\n\nLet's not digress.\n\nPerhaps moving up at turn 0 is fine, and I can get two food quickly.\n\nThen for (1,6), I can go after, but it might be tight with life span, but life span 10, from turn 0 to say turn 10, I can reach it.\n\nBut let's see if I move left at turn 0.\n\nTurn 0: move left to (2,3)\n\nThen go to (1,3) turn 1\n\nThen to (1,4) turn 2\n\nTo (1,5) turn 3\n\nTo (1,6) eat turn 4\n\nThen at (1,6), with body at (1,5)\n\nThen move right to (2,6) turn 5\n\nThen from (2,6), can move down to (2,5), or right to (3,6) but (3,6) obstacle, or up to (2,7) wall, so only down to (2,5)\n\nThen to (2,4), (2,3), etc.\n\nTo reach (5,3), it takes many turns.\n\nFor example, from (2,5) to (3,5), then to (4,5) but (4,5) obstacle, so can't.\n\n(4,5) is obstacle, so at (2,5), can move to (3,5), then to (4,5) invalid, so to (3,4), then to (4,4), etc.\n\nLong path.\n\nWhereas if I go to (5,3) first, I can eat it by turn 3, then (4,1) by turn 6, and (1,6) by say turn 10 or so.\n\nLife span: food disappears after 10 turns, so at turn 10, it should be gone.\n\nAt turn 0, L=10, present until turn 9, disappears at turn 10.\n\nSo I need to eat before turn 10.\n\nTurn 9 is the last chance to eat.\n\nFor (1,6), if I start from turn 4 at (1,6) after eating, but I need to reach it.\n\nIf I am at (4,1) at turn 6, I need to go to (1,6).\n\nManhattan distance |4-1| + |1-6| = 3+5=8, but with obstacles, more.\n\nFor example, from (4,1) at turn 6, I can go to (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3) but (4,3) might be free, then to (3,3), but (3,3) is where I started, but now with body, but should be free.\n\nThen to (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), that's 6 moves from (4,1), so turn 6 to turn 12, but turn 12 is after turn 9, so (1,6) disappears before turn 10, so I can't eat it if I reach after turn 9.\n\nTurn 9 is the last turn to eat.\n\nAt turn 9, if head on food, eat.\n\nAfter turn 9, it disappears.\n\nFrom (4,1) at turn 6, to (1,6) in 3 moves? Impossible, |dx|=3, |dy|=5, min 8 moves.\n\n|4-1|=3, |1-6|=5, min moves 8, since no diagonal.\n\nSo from turn 6, I need at least 8 moves, so turn 14 to reach, but turn 10 food gone, so I can't eat (1,6) if I am at (4,1) on turn 6.\n\nSimilarly, if I go to (5,3) first on turn 3, then to (4,1) on turn 6, same issue.\n\nBut if I go to (1,6) first, I can eat it on turn 4.\n\nThen from there, I can go to other food.\n\nFor example, at (1,6) turn 4, then to (2,6) turn 5, to (2,5) turn 6, to (3,5) turn 7, to (3,4) turn 8? (3,4) free.\n\nThen to (4,4) turn 9, then to (4,3) turn 10, but (4,3) not food, food at (5,3).\n\nAt turn 9, I need to be on food to eat.\n\n(5,3) is at (5,3), from (4,4) at turn 9, I can move down to (4,3) turn 9? But (4,3) not food.\n\nFrom (4,4) turn 8, positions.\n\nAt turn 4: after eating (1,6), at (1,6) with body (1,5)\n\nTurn 5: move right to (2,6)\n\nTurn 6: move down to (2,5)\n\nTurn 7: move down to (2,4) or right to (3,5), say to (3,5) to go towards (5,3)\n\nTurn 7: from (2,5) move to (3,5)  // (3,5) free\n\nTurn 8: from (3,5) can move down to (3,4), or right to (4,5) but (4,5) obstacle, or up to (3,6) obstacle, so only down to (3,4)\n\nTurn 8: move to (3,4)\n\nTurn 9: from (3,4) can move right to (4,4)\n\nNow at (4,4), turn 9.\n\nFood at (5,3), which is one cell away, down-right or something.\n\nFrom (4,4), direction right (moved right), can move down to (4,3), or right to (5,4), or up, not left.\n\n(4,3) is not food, (5,4) not food.\n\n(5,3) is at (5,3), which is adjacent: down from (5,4) or right from (4,3), but not directly from (4,4).\n\nTo reach (5,3) from (4,4), I need to go to (4,3) then (5,3), or (5,4) then (5,3).\n\nBut at turn 9, I can move to (4,3) or (5,4).\n\nNeither is food, so I don't eat on turn 9.\n\nThen after turn 9, food disappears, so I miss (5,3).\n\nSimilarly, (4,1) is far away, and I might not reach it.\n\nIn this path, I ate (1,6) at turn 4, but missed the other food because of time.\n\nIf I go for (5,3) first, I can eat it at turn 3, then (4,1) at turn 6, and (1,6) is not reachable by turn 9 from (4,1).\n\nFrom (4,1) at turn 6, to (1,6) min 8 moves, turn 14, too late.\n\nSo I can only eat two of the three food if I go for (5,3) and (4,1), missing (1,6).\n\nIf I go for (1,6) first, I eat it at turn 4, but then I might miss (5,3) and (4,1) because of obstacles and time.\n\nFor example, to reach (4,1) from (1,6): long path, similar issue.\n\n(4,1) at y=1, (1,6) at y=6, far.\n\nTo reach (5,3) from (1,6), as above, I can get to (4,4) by turn 9, but not to food.\n\nSo I might only eat one food.\n\nBut if I go for (5,3) first, I eat it at turn 3, then (4,1) at turn 6, both eaten by turn 6, and (1,6) expires, but I have two points.\n\nSimilarly, if I go for (1,6) first, I eat it at turn 4, but may not get others.\n\nBut with (1,6) first, I might be able to get to (5,3) if I hurry, but with obstacles, it's tight.\n\nFrom (1,6) turn 4, to (2,6) turn 5, to (2,5) turn 6, to (3,5) turn 7, to (3,4) turn 8, to (4,4) turn 9.\n\nAt turn 9, at (4,4), I can move to (4,3) or (5,4).\n\n(4,3) is not food, (5,4) not food.\n\n(5,3) is adjacent to (4,3) or (5,4), but not reachable in one move from (4,4).\n\nSo I can't eat (5,3) on turn 9.\n\nSimilarly, (4,1) is too far.\n\nSo I can only eat (1,6) and no other.\n\nWhereas if I go for (5,3) and (4,1), I eat two.\n\nSo better to go for the closer food that allows multiple.\n\nBut (4,1) is also time-sensitive.\n\nAnother idea: from (3,3), move up to (3,4) turn 0, then to (4,4) turn 1, then to (4,3) turn 2, then to (4,2) turn 3? But (4,2) not food, food at (4,1).\n\nFrom (4,3) turn 2, I can go to (4,2) turn 3, then to (4,1) turn 4 eat.\n\nBut at turn 2, at (4,3), I could go to (5,3) instead.\n\nBut if I go to (4,2) turn 3, then (4,1) turn 4 eat.\n\nThen from (4,1), I can go to (5,1) etc., but to reach (5,3) or (1,6).\n\n(5,3) is close, from (4,1) turn 4, move to (5,1) turn 5, to (5,2) turn 6, to (5,3) turn 7 eat.\n\nSimilarly, (1,6) far.\n\nBut at turn 7, I eat (5,3), and (1,6) can be eaten if I go, but life span: at turn 7, life span decreased 7 times, from 10 to 3, so disappears after turn 9, so I have turns 7,8,9 to reach (1,6).\n\nFrom (5,3) turn 7, to (1,6) min |5-1| + |3-6| = 4+3=7 moves, so turn 14, too late.\n\nSo only two food possible.\n\nSimilarly, if I eat (1,6) first, only one.\n\nSo the best is to eat (5,3) and (4,1) by moving up first.\n\nBut to eat (4,1) earlier, from turn 2 at (4,3), I can go down to (4,2) turn 3, then to (4,1) turn 4 eat, instead of going to (5,3).\n\nThen at turn 4, at (4,1) with length 2 or something.\n\nThen from there, go to (5,3).\n\nTurn 4: at (4,1) after eating, positions [(4,1), (4,2)] or whatever.\n\nMove to (5,1) turn 5, to (5,2) turn 6, to (5,3) turn 7 eat.\n\nSame as before.\n\nBut I ate (4,1) at turn 4, (5,3) at turn 7.\n\nThen (1,6) not reachable.\n\nIf I go to (5,3) first at turn 3, then to (4,1) at turn 6.\n\nTurn 6 vs turn 7, similar.\n\nBut in both cases, I get two food.\n\nNow, for the initial move, since moving up allows me to get both (5,3) and (4,1), while moving left only gets (1,6) and possibly not others, so moving up is better.\n\nMoreover, moving up avoids the obstacles on the left.\n\nSo at turn 0, move up to (3,4).\n\nThen for the next turns, I need to plan.\n\nBut the answer should be for multiple turns, 5+ turns ahead.\n\nThe format is to output actions for several turns, starting from turn 0.\n\nSince it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" and output actions for turns t1, t1+1, etc.\n\nt1=0, so output actions for turn 0,1,2,3,... for say 5 turns or more.\n\nBut I need to specify a sequence.\n\nSince the future depends on food and state, I can plan a path.\n\nBut for now, let's outline.\n\nTurn 0: move U to (3,4)\n\nThen turn 1: move R to (4,4)\n\nThen turn 2: move D to (4,3)  // not eating yet\n\nThen turn 3: move R to (5,3) eat  // now snake length 2, positions [(5,3),(4,3)]\n\nHead direction R.\n\nThen turn 4: move D to (5,2)  // to go towards (4,1)\n\nAt (5,2), positions [(5,2),(5,3)] head D\n\nThen turn 5: move L to (4,2)  // positions [(4,2),(5,2)]\n\nHead L\n\nThen turn 6: move D to (4,1) eat  // positions [(4,1),(4,2),(5,2)] or something\n\nAfter that, I can continue, but for 5+ turns, up to turn 6.\n\nSince food (1,6) will expire, I might ignore it or try to go if possible, but not reachable, so focus on the area.\n\nAfter eating (4,1), I can explore for more food, but no more food now, so I need to survive.\n\nBut the game might spawn more food, but in this state, only these three.\n\nTo maximize score, I should eat as much as possible.\n\nBut with current, I can eat two.\n\nIf I can find a way to eat all three, but it seems impossible because (1,6) is isolated.\n\nFor example, if from start, I go directly to (1,6), eat at turn 4, then from there, I can go to (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5) obstacle, so to (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), then down to (5,3) eat at turn 9 if I time it.\n\nLet's see.\n\nTurn 0: move L to (2,3)\n\nTurn 1: move L to (1,3)\n\nTurn 2: move U to (1,4)\n\nTurn 3: move U to (1,5)\n\nTurn 4: move U to (1,6) eat  // positions [(1,6),(1,5)]\n\nHead U\n\nTurn 5: move R to (2,6)  // positions [(2,6),(1,6)]\n\nHead R\n\nTurn 6: move D to (2,5)  // positions [(2,5),(2,6)]\n\nHead D\n\nTurn 7: move R to (3,5)  // positions [(3,5),(2,5)]\n\nHead R\n\nTurn 8: move D to (3,4)  // positions [(3,4),(3,5)]\n\nHead D\n\nTurn 9: move R to (4,4)  // positions [(4,4),(3,4)]\n\nHead R\n\nNow at (4,4), turn 9. (5,3) is at (5,3), which is down-right. From (4,4), I can move down to (4,3), but (4,3) not food, or right to (5,4), not food.\n\nTo reach (5,3), I need to go to (5,4) then (5,3), but at turn 9, I am at (4,4), move to (5,4) or (4,3).\n\nIf I move to (5,4) turn 9, not food.\n\nThen turn 10, food disappeared, so I can't eat.\n\nIf from (3,4) turn 8, I move right to (4,4) turn 8? Turn 8: at (3,4), move to (4,4) turn 8.\n\nThen turn 9: from (4,4) move down to (4,3) turn 9, not food, or to (5,4).\n\n(5,3) not adjacent, so no.\n\nThus, impossible to eat (5,3) from here on time.\n\nSimilarly for (4,1).\n\nTherefore, the best is to eat (5,3) and (4,1) by moving up first.\n\nSo for the action sequence.\n\nTurn 0: move U\n\nThen as above.\n\nBut for the answer, I need to output multiple turns.\n\nSince thinking ahead, I can output up to when I eat the second food.\n\nBut the format says to output for turns t1, t1+1, etc., so for turn 0,1,2,3,4,5,6 or something.\n\nLet's list actions.\n\nTurn 0: U (to (3,4))\n\nTurn 1: R (to (4,4))\n\nTurn 2: D (to (4,3))\n\nTurn 3: R (to (5,3), eat)\n\nNow at (5,3), length 2, direction R.\n\nTurn 4: D (to (5,2))\n\nTurn 5: L (to (4,2))\n\nTurn 6: D (to (4,1), eat)\n\nAfter that, I can continue, but for 5+ turns, this is 7 turns.\n\nI could output fewer, but 5+ means at least 5.\n\nSince from turn 0 to turn 3 is 4 turns, but I need to include more.\n\nThe sequence above has actions for turns 0 to 6.\n\nIn turn 2, I moved D to (4,3), which is not food, then turn 3 to (5,3) eat.\n\nI could from turn 2 at (4,3) move D to (4,2) turn 3, then D to (4,1) turn 4 eat, but then (5,3) is not eaten yet.\n\nBut I can go to (5,3) after.\n\nTurn 0: U to (3,4)\n\nTurn 1: R to (4,4)\n\nTurn 2: D to (4,3) // I could move D directly to (4,2) but from (4,3), if I move D, to (4,2)\n\nFrom (4,3), head direction D if I moved down, but in previous, I moved down to (4,3), so direction D.\n\nThen move D to (4,2) turn 3.\n\nThen D to (4,1) turn 4 eat.\n\nThen from (4,1), go to (5,1), (5,2), (5,3) eat turn 7.\n\nBut turn 7 is later than eating (5,3) at turn 3.\n\nBy eating (5,3) first at turn 3, I have more time, but since (4,1) is eaten later, but both within life span.\n\nIn first sequence, (4,1) eaten turn 6, in second turn 4, but (5,3) eaten turn 7 vs turn 3.\n\nEarlier eat might be better to free space or something, but no issue.\n\nBut in terms of score, same two points.\n\nBut eating earlier might allow more food later, but no more now.\n\nSo either way.\n\nI think the first sequence is fine.\n\nFor the answer, I'll go with moving up at turn 0.\n\nAnd output the actions.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score and ensure long-term survival, the AI must prioritize eating the positive food at (5,3) and (4,1) while avoiding the food at (1,6) due to its isolation and the risk of not reaching it before it expires (life span 10 turns). The snake starts at (3,3) with direction left, and moving up allows the quickest path to (5,3) and then to (4,1). The food at (1,6) is not targeted because it cannot be reached within its life span after eating the other food, and attempting it would risk missing both (5,3) and (4,1).\n\n### Analysis of the Plan:\n- **Turn 0 (Current State)**: Snake at [(3,3)], direction left. Possible moves: left to (2,3) or up to (3,4). Moving up is chosen to access the right side of the grid efficiently.\n- **Turn 1**: From (3,4), direction up. Move right to (4,4) to approach (5,3).\n- **Turn 2**: From (4,4), direction right. Move down to (4,3) to position for the move to (5,3).\n- **Turn 3**: From (4,3), direction down. Move right to (5,3) to eat the food (score +1, snake length becomes 2). Positions: head (5,3), body (4,3), direction right.\n- **Turn 4**: From (5,3), direction right. Move down to (5,2) to start path to (4,1).\n- **Turn 5**: From (5,2), direction down. Move left to (4,2) to continue toward (4,1).\n- **Turn 6**: From (4,2), direction left. Move down to (4,1) to eat the food (score +1, snake length becomes 3). Positions: head (4,1), body (4,2), tail (5,2).\n\nAfter turn 6, the snake has eaten two food items and should focus on survival, as (1,6) expires by turn 10 and cannot be reached safely from (4,1) within the remaining turns. The grid has obstacles that block direct paths, and moving toward (1,6) would require at least 8 turns from (4,1), missing the deadline.\n\n### Key Considerations:\n- **Food Life Span**: All food has life span 10 at turn 0. Countdown decreases each turn, including turn 0, so food disappears after turn 9. Eating (5,3) by turn 3 and (4,1) by turn 6 ensures they are consumed before expiration.\n- **Risks Avoided**: \n  - No negative food present.\n  - Tail reward danger not applicable initially (snake length 1) and avoided later by not moving to tail-adjacent food cells.\n  - Collisions: Path avoids walls, obstacles, and body segments. After growth, movements are planned to prevent self-collision (e.g., after turn 3, moving down avoids the body at (4,3)).\n- **Long-Term Survival**: After eating both food, the snake can navigate open areas (e.g., move right or up from (4,1) to avoid corners and obstacles). The plan prioritizes high-value food in accessible regions over the distant (1,6).\n\n### Action Sequence (Turns 0 to 6):\nThe sequence below eats (5,3) on turn 3 and (4,1) on turn 6, maximizing score with minimal risk. Actions are based on 5+ turns of lookahead, ensuring no dead ends and efficient routing.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 0: U (up)  \nTurn 1: R (right)  \nTurn 2: D (down)  \nTurn 3: R (right)  \nTurn 4: D (down)  \nTurn 5: L (left)  \nTurn 6: D (down)  \n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 1, and I'm playing Snake on a grid. The grid has walls: border cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the grid is 8x8 from (0,0) to (7,7). Internal obstacles are at (3,2), (4,5), (3,6), (3,1), and (2,2). So I must avoid these cells.\n\nThe snake positions are given as [(3,4)], which means the snake has only one segment? That can't be right. Snake positions should have multiple segments for a typical snake game. Let me read carefully.\n\n\"Snake Positions: [(3,4)]\" – that's just one position. But in snake, the snake has a head and body segments. If it's only one segment, that means it's just the head, and length is 1. That might be possible at the start.\n\nSnake head direction is \"U\", meaning up, so it's moving upwards.\n\nFood positions are given with coordinates, life span, and value. Format is (x,y, life_span, value), I think. Let's see: \"(5, 3, 9, 1)\" so that's (x=5, y=3, life_span=9, value=1). Similarly, (4,1,9,1), (1,6,9,1), (1,2,10,1). All have value=1, so positive food, no negative food here. Life spans are 9,9,9,10 respectively, meaning they'll disappear after that many turns.\n\nSince it's turn 1, food at (5,3) has 9 turns left, but life span decreases each turn, so after this turn, it will have 8 left, and so on.\n\nNow, the snake is at (3,4) and direction is U, so moving up would go to (3,5), since U is (x,y+1). Let me confirm the coordinate system. It says U is (x,y+1), so y increases upwards, I assume. In grid coordinates, often (0,0) is bottom-left, but in programming, it might be top-left. I need to be careful.\n\nThe walls: border cells x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So if y=0 is the bottom or top? Movement: U (x,y+1) – if U is up, then y+1 should be higher row number if (0,0) is bottom-left, or lower row if (0,0) is top-left. But in the context, it might not matter, as long as consistent. I'll assume (0,0) is bottom-left, so U increases y, towards higher y.\n\nBut let's see the food positions: (5,3), (4,1), etc. and snake at (3,4). Since direction U, from (3,4) up to (3,5).\n\nBut snake positions: only one segment? That seems odd. Perhaps it's a new snake. Length 1.\n\nI should check if there are multiple positions. It says \"Snake Positions: [(3,4)]\" with brackets, but only one element. So yes, snake has only head, no body. So length is 1.\n\nWhen it eats food, length increases.\n\nNow, I need to plan actions for multiple turns ahead, at least 5 turns.\n\nFirst, possible actions: I can move U, D, L, R, but cannot reverse instantly. Current direction is U, so I cannot move D (down) on this turn, because that would be opposite.\n\nNo instant reverse: cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn. So from U, I cannot go D immediately. I can go L, R, or continue U.\n\nSo for turn 1, possible moves: U, L, or R. Not D.\n\nNow, grid is 8x8, walls at borders and internal obstacles.\n\nInternal obstacles: (3,2), (4,5), (3,6), (3,1), (2,2). Let's list all wall cells:\n\n- Borders: all x=0, x=7 for any y; all y=0, y=7 for any x. So cells like (0,0) to (0,7), (7,0) to (7,7), (0,0) to (7,0), (0,7) to (7,7). But corners are included.\n\n- Internal: (3,2), (4,5), (3,6), (3,1), (2,2). (3,1) and (3,2) and (2,2) are close.\n\nNow, snake at (3,4), head direction U.\n\nFood:\n\n- F1: (5,3) value 1, life 9\n\n- F2: (4,1) value 1, life 9\n\n- F3: (1,6) value 1, life 9\n\n- F4: (1,2) value 1, life 10\n\nAll positive food.\n\nSince snake is only head, no body to worry about collisions except walls and obstacles.\n\nAlso, since no body, moving to any adjacent cell is safe as long as not wall or obstacle.\n\nAdjacent cells to (3,4):\n\n- Up (U): (3,5)\n\n- Down (D): (3,3) but cannot move D because of no reverse, and current dir U.\n\n- Left (L): (2,4)\n\n- Right (R): (4,4)\n\nNow, check if these are valid:\n\n(3,5): is it wall? Borders: y=7 is top, so y=5 is not border. x=3 not border. Internal obstacles: (3,6) is obstacle, but (3,5) is not listed, so should be free. Obstacles: (3,2), (4,5), (3,6), (3,1), (2,2). (3,5) not in list, so free.\n\n(2,4): x=2,y=4. Not border, not in obstacles: obstacles are (3,2),(4,5),(3,6),(3,1),(2,2). (2,4) not there, so free.\n\n(4,4): x=4,y=4. Not border. Obstacles: (4,5) is there, but (4,4) is not (4,5), so should be free.\n\n(4,5) is obstacle, but (4,4) is different cell.\n\nSimilarly, (3,3): down, but cannot move there.\n\nSo possible moves from (3,4): U to (3,5), L to (2,4), R to (4,4).\n\nNow, I need to think ahead 5+ turns to maximize score.\n\nFood locations: (5,3), (4,1), (1,6), (1,2)\n\n(5,3) is at x=5,y=3, which is down and right from current (3,4). Since U is up, y increasing, so (3,4) to (5,3) is down in y and right in x.\n\ny: 4 to 3, so down; x:3 to5, right.\n\nSimilarly, (4,1) is x=4,y=1, which is down and a bit right.\n\n(1,6) is x=1,y=6, left and up.\n\n(1,2) is x=1,y=2, left and down.\n\nCurrent position: (3,4)\n\nI need to plan a path to eat food while avoiding dead ends.\n\nSince snake is length 1, eating food will increase length to 2, and then I have to be careful not to hit body.\n\nBut for now, no body.\n\nLife spans: all food has high life span, 9 or 10, so they won't disappear soon. Since we start turn 1, after k turns, life span decreases by k.\n\nBut for planning 5 turns, all food will still be there, since min life is 9, after 5 turns, 4 left, still present.\n\nLife span decreases every turn, including current. So on turn 1, food has life span as given. After turn 1, life span decreases by 1, and so on.\n\nFor example, F1 (5,3) life 9 at turn 1. After turn 1, it will have 8 left, and so on.\n\nBut since all have life >=9, after 5 turns, they have at least 4 left, so still present during 5-turn planning.\n\nNow, I should aim for the closest food or something.\n\nDistance to food:\n\n- To (5,3): Manhattan dist |5-3| + |3-4| = 2 + 1 = 3\n\n- To (4,1): |4-3| + |1-4| = 1 + 3 = 4\n\n- To (1,6): |1-3| + |6-4| = 2 + 2 = 4\n\n- To (1,2): |1-3| + |2-4| = 2 + 2 = 4\n\n(5,3) is closest, dist 3.\n\nBut I need to consider the path and obstacles.\n\nAlso, after eating, snake grows, so I need to avoid getting stuck.\n\nSince no body now, I can go directly.\n\nBut let's see possible moves.\n\nFirst, for turn 1, I can go U, L, or R.\n\nIf I go U to (3,5):\n\n- Then position (3,5), direction U.\n\nPossible next moves: U to (3,6), but (3,6) is obstacle! Internal obstacle (3,6) is wall, so cannot go there.\n\nL to (2,5), or R to (4,5), but (4,5) is also obstacle! (4,5) is internal wall.\n\nSo from (3,5), if I go U, to (3,6) wall, dead.\n\nIf I go L to (2,5), or R to (4,5) wall.\n\n(4,5) is wall, so only possible from (3,5) is L to (2,5), since U and R are blocked or walls.\n\nU to (3,6) wall, R to (4,5) wall, so only L to (2,5) is possible? But I can go D, but after moving U, direction is U, so I can go D? No, no instant reverse, but after moving, direction changes.\n\nLet's clarify movement rules.\n\nAfter each move, the head direction is updated to the move direction.\n\nSo if I move U on turn 1, head is now at (3,5), direction U.\n\nThen for turn 2, I can move U, L, or R, not D.\n\nBut U to (3,6) is wall, impossible.\n\nR to (4,5) is wall, impossible.\n\nL to (2,5) should be free? Check cells: (2,5) not border, not in obstacles list: obstacles are (3,2),(4,5),(3,6),(3,1),(2,2). (2,5) not there, so free.\n\nD to (3,4) but (3,4) is where I came from, but since snake was only head, after moving to (3,5), the body is... snake positions: originally only (3,4), after move U, snake moves to new head and body segments.\n\nSince length was 1, after moving, head is at new position, and the tail moves to where head was? But in snake, when length is 1, moving to a new cell, the snake now has head at new position, and since it grew or not? Not eaten food yet, so length still 1, so only head at (3,5), no body. So (3,4) is now empty.\n\nAfter moving without eating, the snake moves, so the tail follows, but if length 1, moving to new cell, the head is at new cell, and since no tail, it's just the head at new position.\n\nIn this case, from (3,4) move U to (3,5), now snake position is [(3,5)], still length 1.\n\nThen for turn 2, at (3,5), direction U.\n\nPossible moves: U to (3,6) - but (3,6) is wall, invalid.\n\nD to (3,4) - but cannot move opposite, since current direction U, so cannot move D.\n\nL to (2,5) - possible, as (2,5) is free.\n\nR to (4,5) - but (4,5) is wall, invalid.\n\nSo only possible move from (3,5) is L to (2,5).\n\nNo choice.\n\nThen go to (2,5), direction L (since moved left).\n\nThen at (2,5), direction L.\n\nPossible moves: U to (2,6), D to (2,4), L to (1,5), R to (3,5) but cannot reverse, so not R (since current dir L, cannot go R).\n\nSo can go U, D, or L.\n\n(2,6): not border, not obstacle, free.\n\n(2,4): not border, not obstacle (obstacles include (2,2), but (2,4) not, so free.\n\n(1,5): x=1,y=5, not border (x=0 border, but x=1 not), not obstacle, free.\n\nSo options.\n\nBut if I go to (3,5) on turn 1, I'm forced to go to (2,5) on turn 2, and then I have choices.\n\nBut going to (3,5) might not be good because it limits options.\n\nNow, back to turn 1, other options: move L to (2,4) or R to (4,4).\n\nFirst, move L to (2,4) on turn 1.\n\nThen head at (2,4), direction L.\n\nThen for turn 2, possible moves: U to (2,5), D to (2,3), L to (1,4), or R to (3,4) but cannot reverse, so not R.\n\nCurrent direction L, so cannot move R (opposite).\n\nCan go U, D, or L.\n\n(2,5): free, as before.\n\n(2,3): y=3, not border, obstacles: (3,2) is obstacle, but (2,3) not listed, so free.\n\n(1,4): x=1,y=4, not border, not obstacle, free.\n\nNow, move R to (4,4) on turn 1.\n\nThen head at (4,4), direction R.\n\nThen turn 2, possible moves: U to (4,5), but (4,5) is wall, invalid.\n\nD to (4,3), L to (3,4), R to (5,4).\n\nBut cannot move opposite? Current direction R, so cannot move L (opposite).\n\nCan go U, D, or R.\n\nU to (4,5) wall, invalid.\n\nD to (4,3): should be free? (4,3) not border, not in obstacles: obstacles (3,2),(4,5),(3,6),(3,1),(2,2), no (4,3), so free.\n\nR to (5,4): x=5,y=4, not border, not obstacle, free.\n\nL to (3,4) but cannot, because reverse not allowed.\n\nSo from (4,4), can go D to (4,3) or R to (5,4).\n\nNow, comparing starting moves.\n\nIf I go U on turn 1, I end up at (2,5) on turn 2 with limited choice earlier.\n\nIf I go L, to (2,4), then I can go to various places.\n\nIf I go R, to (4,4), then I can go to (4,3) or (5,4).\n\nNow, I need to think about food.\n\nClosest food is (5,3), dist 3.\n\nFrom current (3,4), to (5,3), I need to go right and down.\n\nBut since I cannot go down directly, I have to go right or left or up first.\n\nIf I go R to (4,4) on turn 1, then from there, I can go D to (4,3) on turn 2, then from (4,3), I can go L to (3,3), D to (4,2), R to (5,3), etc.\n\n(5,3) is food, so if I go to (5,3), I can eat it.\n\nBut let's see the path.\n\nTurn 1: R to (4,4)  // direction now R\n\nTurn 2: from (4,4), I can go D to (4,3)  // since U is wall, R or D possible, D to (4,3)\n\nThen at (4,3), direction D.\n\nThen turn 3: from (4,3), possible moves: U to (4,4) but just came from, and direction D, so cannot move U (reverse). Can go D to (4,2), L to (3,3), R to (5,3).\n\n(5,3) is food, so I can go R to (5,3) and eat it on turn 3.\n\nBut when I eat, snake grows, so length becomes 2.\n\nAfter eating, head at (5,3), and tail at previous position? Let's see the sequence.\n\nStart: turn 1, snake at [(3,4)]\n\nAfter move R to (4,4), snake now at [(4,4)] since no body, still length 1.\n\nTurn 2: move D to (4,3), snake at [(4,3)]\n\nTurn 3: move R to (5,3), now at (5,3), which has food, so eat it. Value +1, length increases to 2. Now snake positions: head at (5,3), and tail at previous head position, which was (4,3). So snake: [(5,3), (4,3)]\n\nDirection now R.\n\nNow, after eating, I need to continue.\n\nBut I have to plan multiple turns.\n\nIn this path, I ate food on turn 3.\n\nNow, other options.\n\nIf I go L on turn 1 to (2,4).\n\nThen at (2,4), direction L.\n\nTurn 2: I can go, say, D to (2,3) or U to (2,5) or L to (1,4).\n\n(1,2) is food at (1,2), so I could go towards it.\n\nFor example, from (2,4) go D to (2,3), then to (2,2) but (2,2) is obstacle, cannot.\n\n(2,2) is wall, so from (2,3), I cannot go to (2,2).\n\nFrom (2,4), go D to (2,3): at (2,3), direction D.\n\nThen turn 3: from (2,3), possible moves: U to (2,4), but cannot, reverse. D to (2,2) but wall. L to (1,3), R to (3,3).\n\nSo can go L to (1,3) or R to (3,3).\n\n(1,3) is not food, food at (1,2) or (1,6).\n\n(1,2) is below, but (2,2) is wall, so I need to go around.\n\nFrom (2,3) go L to (1,3), then at (1,3), direction L.\n\nThen turn 4: from (1,3), can go U to (1,4), D to (1,2), L to (0,3) but x=0 is wall, or R to (2,3) but cannot reverse.\n\nCurrent direction L, so can go U, D, or L, but L to (0,3) wall, so only U or D.\n\nD to (1,2): (1,2) is food, so eat it.\n\nSo if go D on turn 4, eat at (1,2).\n\nSequence: turn 1: L to (2,4)\n\nTurn 2: D to (2,3)  // assuming I choose D\n\nTurn 3: L to (1,3)\n\nTurn 4: D to (1,2) eat food.\n\nAte on turn 4.\n\nCompared to going right, ate on turn 3.\n\nSimilarly, going up first might be worse.\n\nNow, back to going right: after eating at (5,3) on turn 3, snake at [(5,3), (4,3)] direction R.\n\nNow, what next? Need to move to other food.\n\nAvailable food: (4,1), (1,6), (1,2), but (1,2) might be eaten if I go left, but now I'm at right.\n\nLife spans: after turn 3, all food life decreases by 3? Turn 1: food life as given.\n\nAfter each turn, life decreases.\n\nAt start turn 1, food life: F1 (5,3) life 9, after turn 1, when I move, but food is eaten when head moves to it.\n\nLife span decreases every turn, regardless.\n\nBut for planning.\n\nAfter I eat (5,3) on turn 3, it's gone.\n\nNow snake at (5,3) and (4,3), direction R.\n\nPossible moves from (5,3): since direction R, I can go U, D, or R, not L (opposite).\n\nU to (5,4), D to (5,2), R to (6,3).\n\n(6,3): x=6, not border (x=7 border, so x=6 ok), y=3, not border, no obstacle, should be free.\n\n(5,4): similarly free.\n\n(5,2): free, but y=2, obstacles? (3,2) is obstacle, but (5,2) not listed, so free.\n\nNow, I need to go to other food, like (4,1) or (1,6) or (1,2).\n\n(4,1) is at (4,1), which is left and down from (5,3).\n\n|4-5| + |1-3| = 1 + 2 = 3 dist.\n\n(1,6) is far, dist |1-5| + |6-3| = 4 + 3 = 7\n\n(1,2) |1-5| + |2-3| = 4 + 1 = 5\n\nSo (4,1) is closest.\n\nNow, to go to (4,1) from (5,3), I need to go left and down.\n\nBut since direction R, I can go D to (5,2) first.\n\nThen from (5,2), direction D.\n\nThen can go L to (4,2), D to (5,1), R to (6,2), not U.\n\n(5,1): y=1, not border, obstacles? (3,1) is obstacle, but (5,1) not, so free.\n\n(4,2): but (3,2) is obstacle, (4,2) should be free.\n\nFrom (5,2) go L to (4,2), then at (4,2), direction L.\n\nThen turn 5: from (4,2), can go U to (4,3), but (4,3) is tail? Snake positions: after turn 3, snake at (5,3) head, (4,3) tail.\n\nAfter move to (5,2) on turn 4? Let's timeline.\n\nTurn 3: after move to (5,3), ate, snake [(5,3), (4,3)] dir R.\n\nTurn 4: move from (5,3) to, say, D to (5,2). Since moved D, head now (5,2), tail moves to (5,3)? When moving, head moves to new cell, tail follows if not growing, but since we ate on turn 3, when moving on turn 4, no food eaten, so tail moves to where head was, so snake: head at (5,2), tail at (5,3). Positions: [(5,2), (5,3)]? No.\n\nStandard snake movement: when no food, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to previous position of the segment ahead, so tail moves to where the second last was.\n\nInitially after eating on turn 3: head (5,3), body (4,3)\n\nTurn 4: move head to new position, say (5,2). Then body moves to previous head position, so now head (5,2), body (5,3). So positions [(5,2), (5,3)]\n\nDirection now D.\n\nThen turn 5: from (5,2), move to, say, L to (4,2). Then head to (4,2), body to (5,2). So snake [(4,2), (5,2)]\n\nDirection L.\n\nNow, from (4,2), I want to go to (4,1), which is down.\n\nBut (4,1) is food.\n\nFrom (4,2), direction L, so I can go D to (4,1), since not reverse.\n\nGo D to (4,1), eat food on turn 6.\n\nBut let's count turns.\n\nTurn 1: R to (4,4)\n\nTurn 2: D to (4,3)\n\nTurn 3: R to (5,3) eat\n\nNow turn 4: from (5,3) move D to (5,2)  // no eat\n\nSnake: [(5,2), (5,3)] dir D\n\nTurn 5: from (5,2) move L to (4,2)  // no eat, snake now [(4,2), (5,2)] dir L\n\nTurn 6: from (4,2) move D to (4,1) eat, value +1, length now 3.\n\nSnake positions: head (4,1), body (4,2), and (5,2)? After moving to (4,1), head at (4,1), body moves: previous head was (4,2), so body at (4,2), and the tail was (5,2), but since we ate, tail stays? When eating, the tail doesn't move, so new segment added.\n\nAfter turn 5: snake [(4,2), (5,2)] head (4,2), tail (5,2)\n\nTurn 6: move head to (4,1), which has food, so eat. Then head at (4,1), and since eating, tail doesn't move, so body remains (4,2), and new segment added? The body grows when eating.\n\nStandard: when head moves to food, it eats, so length increases, head at new position, body: the tail stays in place, and new segment is added at tail, but no, in snake, when eating, the head moves to food, the body follows, but since tail doesn't move, it grows by one.\n\nPositions: after moving head to food, the new head is at food cell, the previous positions: the segment that was tail remains, and new segment is added, but the body doesn't move that turn? Let's think.\n\nTypically: when not eating, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, so tail moves away from its position.\n\nWhen eating, head moves to food, but the tail does not move, so a new segment is added at the tail position, but since tail didn't move, it stays, and the new head is at food, and body segments shift.\n\nExample: before move, snake positions: [H, B1, B2, ..., T]\n\nAfter move without eating: new head at new position, then B1 to old H, B2 to old B1, ..., T to old second last, so T position is abandoned.\n\nWith eating: new head at food, then B1 to old H, B2 to old B1, ..., T to old second last, but since we add a segment, the tail stays, and a new segment is added at the old tail position? No.\n\nWhen eating, the head moves to the food, the body segments move as usual, but the tail does not advance, so the new tail is the old tail, and length increases by one.\n\nPositions: after eating, the snake has head at new position, then the first body segment at previous head, and so on, up to the tail which remains in place.\n\nFor example, before eat: positions [A, B] head A, tail B.\n\nAfter move to food cell C, with eat: new positions [C, A, B] head C, body A, tail B. So tail B remains.\n\nIn this case, after turn 5: snake at [(4,2), (5,2)] head (4,2), tail (5,2)\n\nTurn 6: move head to (4,1), which has food, so eat. New head (4,1), body: previous head (4,2) becomes body, tail (5,2) remains. So snake [(4,1), (4,2), (5,2)]\n\nLength 3.\n\nBack to planning.\n\nIn this path, I ate two food by turn 6.\n\nBut I need to output actions for multiple turns, but the problem says \"think 5+ turns ahead\" but output format is to specify actions for several turns starting from t1.\n\nThe answer format is to list actions for turn t1, t1+1, etc., but it doesn't specify how many, but since it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I should output at least 5 turns of actions.\n\nBut in the context, I can output a sequence.\n\nNow, alternative: if I go left first.\n\nTurn 1: L to (2,4)\n\nThen at (2,4) dir L.\n\nThen I can go to (1,2) as before.\n\nTurn 2: D to (2,3)\n\nTurn 3: L to (1,3)\n\nTurn 4: D to (1,2) eat\n\nNow snake at (1,2), with body? Start turn 1: [(3,4)]\n\nTurn 1 L to (2,4): snake [(2,4)]\n\nTurn 2 D to (2,3): snake [(2,3)]\n\nTurn 3 L to (1,3): snake [(1,3)]\n\nTurn 4 D to (1,2) eat: so head to (1,2), since ate, length increases, so snake now [(1,2), (1,3)]? Before move, snake at [(1,3)] head only? After turn 3, snake at [(1,3)] length 1.\n\nTurn 4 move D to (1,2) eat: new head (1,2), and since ate, tail remains, but there was no tail, so snake now [(1,2)] but with length 2? Positions: head at (1,2), and the previous position was (1,3), so body at (1,3). So [(1,2), (1,3)] dir D.\n\nNow, from here, I can go to other food, like (1,6) or (4,1) or (5,3) but (5,3) might be eaten or not.\n\n(1,6) is at (1,6), same x, up.\n\nFrom (1,2) dir D, I can go U, but U is opposite to current dir D? Current direction after move to (1,2) is D, since moved down.\n\nSo can go L, R, or U? Directions: can move U, L, R, not D (reverse).\n\nU to (1,3), but (1,3) is the body! Snake at [(1,2), (1,3)], so (1,3) is occupied by body.\n\nMoving to (1,3) would cause collision.\n\nL to (0,2) but x=0 wall.\n\nR to (2,2) but (2,2) is obstacle, wall.\n\nD cannot, reverse.\n\nSo only possible is U, but U to (1,3) body, collision, death.\n\nOh! Problem.\n\nAfter eating at (1,2), snake at [(1,2), (1,3)] direction D.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- U: to (1,3) but body is there, collision.\n\n- D: to (1,1) but cannot, reverse.\n\n- L: to (0,2) x=0 wall.\n\n- R: to (2,2) but (2,2) is obstacle.\n\nAll moves invalid or deadly. Snake is trapped!\n\nTherefore, going to (1,2) first is bad because after eating, I have no safe move.\n\nThe tail is at (1,3), and I'm at (1,2), so I can only go up to (1,3) which is body, or other directions blocked.\n\nSo this is a dead end.\n\nTherefore, I should not go to (1,2) when the snake is short, or need to approach differently.\n\nFor example, if I go to (1,2) from another direction.\n\nBut in this case, from (1,3), I moved down to (1,2), so head down, tail at (1,3).\n\nTo avoid this, I should not have the body behind me when moving to food adjacent to wall or obstacle.\n\nBut (1,2) has walls on left and below? y=0 is border, but (1,2) y=2, not bottom.\n\nBut obstacles and borders block.\n\nSpecifically, left is x=0 wall, right is (2,2) obstacle, down is (1,1) which might be free but cannot go down because direction, up is body.\n\nSo indeed trapped.\n\nTherefore, eating (1,2) in this way is fatal.\n\nSimilarly, I need to be careful with food near edges.\n\nNow, back to the right path, after eating (5,3) and then (4,1), I was at turn 6 eating (4,1).\n\nBut let's see the state.\n\nAfter eating (5,3) on turn 3, I went to (5,2) then (4,2) then (4,1).\n\nOn turn 5, I was at (4,2), moved to (4,1) on turn 6.\n\nBut after turn 4, snake at [(5,2), (5,3)] dir D\n\nTurn 5: move L to (4,2), no eat, so snake moves to [(4,2), (5,2)] dir L\n\nTurn 6: move D to (4,1) eat, so snake now [(4,1), (4,2), (5,2)] head (4,1), body (4,2), tail (5,2) dir D.\n\nNow from here, I need to move on.\n\nPossible moves from (4,1) dir D.\n\nCan go U, L, R, not D.\n\nU to (4,2) but body there, collision.\n\nL to (3,1) but (3,1) is obstacle! Internal obstacle (3,1) wall.\n\nR to (5,1), possible? (5,1) not border, not obstacle, free.\n\nD cannot.\n\nSo only possible R to (5,1).\n\nGo to (5,1), dir R? Moved right, so dir R.\n\nThen snake: head at (5,1), body: previous head (4,1) to body, tail (4,2)? After move: head to (5,1), no eat, so tail moves: previous positions, head was (4,1), body (4,2), tail (5,2). After head move to (5,1), body moves: first body segment to old head (4,1), second body segment to old body (4,2), and tail to old second last, which is (4,2), but (4,2) was body, now tail moves to where it was? Positions: before move: [ (4,1), (4,2), (5,2) ] head (4,1), body segments: (4,2) and (5,2) tail.\n\nAfter move head to (5,1), not eat, so new head (5,1), body: segment 1 to previous head (4,1), segment 2 to previous segment 1 (4,2), and tail to previous segment 2 (5,2). So snake: [(5,1), (4,1), (4,2)]? Let's list: head (5,1), then the segment that was head is now body, so (4,1), then the next segment was (4,2), so (4,2), then the tail was (5,2), so (5,2) should be new tail, but since tail moves to previous position of the segment ahead, which was (4,2), no.\n\nPositions: let's index.\n\nBefore move: positions: index 0: head (4,1), index 1: body (4,2), index 2: tail (5,2)\n\nAfter move: head moves to new cell (5,1), then index 1 moves to previous index 0 (4,1), index 2 moves to previous index 1 (4,2). So new positions: head (5,1), body (4,1), body (4,2), so [(5,1), (4,1), (4,2)] and tail is (4,2).\n\nBut (4,2) is at the end.\n\nDirection now R.\n\nFrom (5,1), dir R, can go U to (5,2), but (5,2) is the tail? In positions, (5,2) is not occupied now? Current positions: head (5,1), body (4,1), body (4,2). So (5,2) is free? (4,2) is occupied, but (5,2) is not in snake anymore.\n\nAfter move to (5,1), the cell (5,2) is empty, since tail moved to (4,2).\n\nBefore move, snake occupied (4,1), (4,2), (5,2)\n\nAfter move to (5,1), head to (5,1), body to (4,1), and the segment that was at (5,2) moves to (4,2), so now occupied cells: (5,1), (4,1), (4,2). (5,2) is free.\n\nSo from (5,1), U to (5,2) is free, can go.\n\nSimilarly, D to (5,0) but y=0 border wall, invalid.\n\nL to (4,1) but body there, collision.\n\nR to (6,1) possible? x=6, not border.\n\nSo can go U to (5,2) or R to (6,1).\n\nBut (5,2) was previous tail position, now free.\n\nNow, I can go to other food, like (1,6) or whatever.\n\nBut not critical now.\n\nThe point is, in the right path, I can survive.\n\nBut earlier, if I go to (1,2), I die immediately.\n\nTherefore, going towards (5,3) is better.\n\nNow, what about (1,6)? It might be safe.\n\nBut (5,3) is closer.\n\nAnother food is (4,1), but it's down.\n\nIn the beginning, I could go directly to (4,1) but from (3,4), I cannot go down directly because direction U, cannot reverse.\n\nSo I have to go around.\n\nFor example, go R to (4,4), then D to (4,3), then D to (4,2), then L to (3,2) but (3,2) obstacle, cannot.\n\n(4,1) is at (4,1), so from (4,3) go D to (4,2), then D to (4,1).\n\nBut from (4,3), after going R and D.\n\nIn the path I had, I ate (5,3) first.\n\n(1,6) is at (1,6), which is up and left.\n\nIf I go L on turn 1 to (2,4), then U to (2,5), then L to (1,5), then U to (1,6) eat.\n\nLet's see.\n\nTurn 1: L to (2,4) dir L\n\nTurn 2: U to (2,5) dir U? After move L to (2,4), dir L. Then turn 2 move U to (2,5), now dir U.\n\nThen turn 3: from (2,5) dir U, can go U to (2,6), L to (1,5), or R to (3,5), not D.\n\n(2,6) free, (1,5) free, (3,5) free but earlier.\n\nGo L to (1,5) dir L.\n\nThen turn 4: from (1,5) dir L, can go U to (1,6), D to (1,4), L to (0,5) wall, or R to (2,5) but cannot reverse.\n\nSo go U to (1,6) eat on turn 4.\n\nThen snake: after eat, head at (1,6), body at (1,5) since previous position.\n\nThen from there, I can move, but (1,6) is near border, y=7 above, but y=6, U to (1,7) border wall, D to (1,5) body, L to (0,6) wall, R to (2,6) free.\n\nSo can go R to (2,6).\n\nThen ok.\n\nBut I ate on turn 4, later than (5,3) on turn 3.\n\nAnd (1,6) is farther.\n\nNow, back to the initial choice.\n\nAlso, there is food at (4,1), but similar.\n\nBut in the beginning, going U might be bad as I thought earlier.\n\nIf I go U on turn 1 to (3,5), then only choice turn 2 L to (2,5), then from (2,5) I can go to (1,5) or (2,6), etc., but not direct to food.\n\nFor example, to (1,6) from (2,5) go U to (2,6), then L to (1,6) on turn 4, eat.\n\nBut slower.\n\nSo overall, going R to (4,4) then D to (4,3) then R to (5,3) to eat on turn 3 seems efficient.\n\nThen I can continue to (4,1) as before.\n\nBut for the output, I need to specify actions for several turns.\n\nSince the problem says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I should output at least 5 actions.\n\nCurrent turn t1=1.\n\nSo actions for turn 1,2,3,4,5,...\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nTurn 1: R to (4,4)\n\nTurn 2: D to (4,3)\n\nTurn 3: R to (5,3) eat\n\nNow turn 4: from (5,3) with body at (4,3), dir R.\n\nI need to go to another food, say (4,1).\n\nSo I can go D to (5,2) as before.\n\nThen turn 5: L to (4,2)\n\nThen turn 6: D to (4,1) eat\n\nBut turn 6 is beyond 5, but I can include.\n\nSince thinking ahead, I can output up to turn 5 or 6.\n\nBut at turn 4, from (5,3) dir R, I can also go U to (5,4) or R to (6,3), but (4,1) is down, so going down is better.\n\n(1,6) is far, so not efficient.\n\nPerhaps I can go to (1,2) but carefully, but it's risky.\n\n(1,2) has life span 10, longer, so I can get it later.\n\nSimilarly, (1,6) life 9.\n\nBut since I ate (5,3) on turn 3, and it had life 9, eaten, gone.\n\nNow (4,1) life 9, (1,6) life 9, (1,2) life 10.\n\nAfter eating (4,1) on turn 6, I can go to (1,2) or (1,6).\n\nBut (1,2) is dangerous as we saw, but now snake is longer, might be different.\n\nFor example, from (4,1) after eating, I was at (4,1) with body, and I moved R to (5,1), etc.\n\nBut to go to (1,2), I need to go left and up or something.\n\nBut not immediate.\n\nFor the action sequence, I can output turns 1 to 5.\n\nTurn 1: R\n\nTurn 2: D\n\nTurn 3: R  // eat at (5,3)\n\nNow turn 4: from (5,3) with dir R, I need to move. Options: U, D, R.\n\nIf I go D to (5,2), as before.\n\nOr R to (6,3), but that might lead away.\n\nD is towards (4,1).\n\nSimilarly, turn 5: from (5,2) dir D, then I can go L to (4,2), etc.\n\nBut turn 5 action depends.\n\nSince I need to specify, I can commit to a path.\n\nAnother thing: the tail reward danger. But in this case, no food under tail yet.\n\nSince snake is short, not an issue.\n\nAlso, food can spawn under body, but not currently.\n\nSo I think going right then down is good.\n\nTherefore, for turn 1: R\n\nTurn 2: D\n\nTurn 3: R\n\nNow for turn 4, at (5,3) dir R, move D to (5,2)\n\nThen turn 5, at (5,2) dir D, move L to (4,2)\n\nBut turn 5 is the fifth action? Let's list turns:\n\nAction for turn 1: R\n\nAction for turn 2: D\n\nAction for turn 3: R\n\nAction for turn 4: D (to (5,2))\n\nAction for turn 5: L (to (4,2))\n\nThen I can stop or continue.\n\nBut on turn 5, I move to (4,2), which is not food, no eat.\n\nThen later to (4,1).\n\nBut for thinking ahead, this should be fine.\n\nI could go directly to (4,1) from (5,3), but I need to go left and down, but from (5,3) dir R, I cannot go left directly, because L is opposite? Current dir R, so cannot move L.\n\nMust go U, D, or R first.\n\nSo going D is the way.\n\nSimilarly, after D to (5,2), I can go L to (4,2), then D to (4,1).\n\nNow, what about the internal obstacles? For example, (3,2) is obstacle, but I'm going to (4,2), which is adjacent, but not an issue.\n\n(4,2) is free.\n\nNow, another point: when I go to (4,2) on turn 5, from (5,2) dir D, move L to (4,2).\n\nThen at (4,2), dir L.\n\nThen I can go D to (4,1) on turn 6.\n\nBut (4,1) is food.\n\nIn the sequence, I can include up to turn 5 for output.\n\nSince the food (4,1) might be eaten, but in turn 5 action, I don't eat yet.\n\nBut I think it's ok.\n\nTo maximize, I could consider if there is a better path.\n\nFor example, from start, if I go L to (2,4), then to (1,4) or something, but to (1,6) takes more turns, and (1,2) is risky.\n\nSo I think R path is better.\n\nTherefore, actions:\n\nTurn 1: R\n\nTurn 2: D\n\nTurn 3: R\n\nTurn 4: D\n\nTurn 5: L\n\nThen on turn 6, I would go D to (4,1) to eat.\n\nBut for output, since it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", outputting 5 actions should be fine.\n\nI could output more, but not necessary.\n\nNow, about the direction: after each move, direction is updated.\n\nIn the sequence, it should be clear.\n\nAlso, in the answer format, it should be in a box.\n\nSo for turn t1=1:\n\nTurn 1: R\n\nTurn 2: D\n\nTurn 3: R\n\nTurn 4: D\n\nTurn 5: L\n\nBut let me confirm the positions.\n\nStart turn 1: snake at (3,4) dir U\n\nTurn 1: move R to (4,4), now dir R, snake [(4,4)]\n\nTurn 2: move D to (4,3), dir D, snake [(4,3)]\n\nTurn 3: move R to (5,3), eat, so snake [(5,3), (4,3)] dir R\n\nTurn 4: move D to (5,2), no eat, snake head (5,2), body to (5,3), so [(5,2), (5,3)] dir D\n\nTurn 5: move L to (4,2), no eat, snake head (4,2), body to (5,2), so [(4,2), (5,2)] dir L\n\nNow, from here, I can go D to (4,1) to eat on next turn.\n\nAll safe.\n\nIf I had gone U on turn 1, it would be worse.\n\nSo this seems good.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while ensuring long-term survival, I evaluated possible moves 5+ turns ahead, prioritizing paths that avoid dead ends and efficiently collect positive food. The snake starts at (3,4) with direction U (up). The grid has walls at borders (x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7) and internal obstacles at (3,2), (4,5), (3,6), (3,1), and (2,2). All food is positive: (5,3) with life span 9, (4,1) with life span 9, (1,6) with life span 9, and (1,2) with life span 10. Since the snake has only one segment initially, body collisions are not an immediate concern, but growth after eating must be managed to avoid future collisions.\n\n### Key Considerations:\n- **Immediate Moves (Turn 1)**: Current direction is U, so reverse move D is invalid. Possible moves are U, L, or R.\n  - **U (to (3,5))**: Leads to a dead end. From (3,5), only L to (2,5) is possible on turn 2 due to walls at (3,6) and (4,5). This path delays food access and limits options.\n  - **L (to (2,4))**: Allows access to (1,2) or (1,6), but moving to (1,2) risks a trap after eating (e.g., collision or wall). (1,6) is farther, requiring more turns.\n  - **R (to (4,4))**: Positions the snake closer to high-value food like (5,3) (distance 3) and avoids immediate risks. From (4,4), I can reach (5,3) by turn 3 and then proceed to (4,1) efficiently.\n- **Long-Term Path**: Moving R on turn 1 enables a sequence to eat (5,3) on turn 3 and (4,1) by turn 6. (5,3) is the closest food, and the path to (4,1) is safe with no body collision risks during the sequence. (1,6) and (1,2) are less efficient or riskier; (1,2) is avoided due to trap potential.\n- **Risk Avoidance**: The chosen path avoids walls and obstacles, and snake growth is managed (e.g., after eating (5,3), moves are chosen to prevent the head from colliding with the body). Food life spans are high (all ≥9), so no food disappears within 5 turns.\n- **5-Turn Plan**: The sequence below eats (5,3) on turn 3 and positions for (4,1) on turn 6. Actions for turns 1-5 are specified, with thinking extended to turn 6 for context.\n\n### Action Sequence:\n- **Turn 1 (from (3,4), dir U)**: Move R to (4,4). (Cannot move D; R avoids dead ends and heads toward (5,3).)\n- **Turn 2 (from (4,4), dir R)**: Move D to (4,3). (U and R blocked by walls; D enables path to (5,3).)\n- **Turn 3 (from (4,3), dir D)**: Move R to (5,3) and eat (+1 score, length=2). (Cannot move U (reverse); R eats closest food efficiently.)\n- **Turn 4 (from (5,3), dir R)**: Move D to (5,2). (Cannot move L (reverse); D avoids body at (4,3) and heads toward (4,1). U and R are safe but less efficient for (4,1).)\n- **Turn 5 (from (5,2), dir D)**: Move L to (4,2). (Cannot move U (reverse); L positions for (4,1) on turn 6. R to (6,2) is possible but diverts from food.)\n\n### Beyond Turn 5 (for context, not part of output):\n- **Turn 6 (from (4,2), dir L)**: Move D to (4,1) to eat (+1 score, length=3). (Cannot move U (body collision) or L (wall at (3,1)); D is safe and eats food.)\n\nThis sequence scores +1 by turn 3 and +2 by turn 6, with no collision risks. It prioritizes survival by avoiding the trapped state at (1,2) and inefficient paths.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 1: R (right)\nTurn 2: D (down)\nTurn 3: R (right)\nTurn 4: D (down)\nTurn 5: L (left)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 2, and the snake is at position (4,4) with head direction right (R). That means the snake is only one segment long right now, just the head. So, no body to worry about collisions with except walls and obstacles.\n\nThe grid has borders: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7, so it's an 8x8 grid. Walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 for borders. Also, internal obstacles at: (3,2), (4,5), (3,6), (3,1), (2,2). I should note these down to avoid.\n\nFood items:\n\n- (5,3) with value 1 and life span 8 (so disappears after 8 turns, including this one? Life span decreases every turn, so if life span is 8 at turn 2, it will disappear after turn 9? Let me clarify.\n\nLife span: disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current. So at turn t, if life span is L, it will disappear after turn t + L - 1? For example, at turn 2, life span 8, so it exists from turn 2 to turn 9, since after 8 turns, it would be gone on turn 10? Let's think carefully.\n\nIf life span is N at turn t, it decreases by 1 each turn. So at turn t, life span N; turn t+1, N-1; ... turn t + N - 1, life span 1; turn t + N, life span 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten from turn t to turn t + N - 1.\n\nIn this case, for food at (5,3): value 1, life span 8 at turn 2. So it exists until turn 2 + 8 - 1 = turn 9. Similarly for others.\n\n- (4,1): value 1, life span 8, exists until turn 9\n\n- (1,6): value 1, life span 8, exists until turn 9\n\n- (1,2): value 1, life span 9, exists until turn 10 (since 2 + 9 - 1 = 10)\n\nAll food has value +1, so all positive food. No negative food mentioned.\n\nSnake positions: only (4,4), so length 1. Head direction R.\n\nSince snake is only one segment, moving will grow the snake. When it eats food, it grows, but since it's length 1, after eating, it will be length 2.\n\nBut for now, no body, so no collision risk except walls and obstacles.\n\nNow, I need to plan 5+ turns ahead. Since the snake is short, I should aim to eat food while avoiding dead ends.\n\nFirst, let's sketch the grid.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. So cells (0,0) to (7,7).\n\nWalls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are all walls. So we can't go there.\n\nInternal obstacles: (3,2), (4,5), (3,6), (3,1), (2,2)\n\nList them:\n\n- (3,1)\n\n- (2,2)\n\n- (3,2)\n\n- (4,5)\n\n- (3,6)\n\n(3,1), (2,2), (3,2) are close to each other. (3,1) is y=1, x=3; (2,2) x=2,y=2; (3,2) x=3,y=2.\n\nThen (4,5) and (3,6).\n\nSnake head at (4,4), direction R.\n\nPossible moves: since direction is R, I can move U, D, R (but not L because that would be reverse, but since no body, it might be allowed? No, the rule says \"no instant reverse\": cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn. Current direction is R, so opposite is L. So I cannot move left immediately. So allowed moves: U, D, R.\n\nNow, current position (4,4). Moving:\n\n- U: to (4,5) but (4,5) is an obstacle! (4,5) is in internal obstacles: (4,5) is listed. So cannot go there.\n\n- D: to (4,3)\n\n- R: to (5,4)\n\nL is not allowed because reverse.\n\nSo possible moves: D to (4,3) or R to (5,4).\n\nU is blocked by obstacle.\n\nNow, let's see food locations:\n\n- (5,3) - that's one step right and one down from (4,4)? From (4,4), (5,3) is down-right, but we can only move one cell at a time.\n\n(5,3) is at x=5,y=3.\n\nFrom (4,4), to reach (5,3), I need to go right then down, or down then right, etc.\n\nSimilarly, other food: (4,1) which is almost straight down, but with obstacles.\n\n(4,1) is at x=4,y=1. But there is obstacle at (3,1) and (3,2), etc.\n\n(1,6) far away.\n\n(1,2) also far.\n\nSince I need to think 5+ turns ahead, I should consider paths to food.\n\nFirst, let's map the grid to avoid obstacles.\n\nList all obstacles:\n\nBorders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are all walls.\n\nInternal: (3,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,5), (3,6)\n\n(4,5) is occupied, so (4,5) cannot be moved to.\n\nSimilarly, (3,1), (2,2), (3,2), (3,6) cannot be moved to.\n\nNow, snake at (4,4).\n\nAvailable moves: D to (4,3) or R to (5,4).\n\nIf I go R to (5,4), that's safe, no obstacle.\n\nThen from (5,4), I can go U, D, L, R? Direction would be R after moving right, so head direction becomes R.\n\nCurrent direction is R, moving R keeps direction R.\n\nThen from (5,4), possible moves: U to (5,5), D to (5,3), L to (4,4), but (4,4) might be occupied? No, since snake is moving, the tail moves away, but currently snake is only one segment, so when it moves, the old position is vacated.\n\nSince snake is length 1, moving to a new cell, the old cell is empty.\n\nSo from (5,4), I can move U to (5,5), D to (5,3), L to (4,4) which is empty, or R to (6,4).\n\nBut (5,3) has food! (5,3) is a food position with value 1.\n\nIf I move to (5,4) now, then next turn I can move D to (5,3) to eat it.\n\nBut let's see the life span: all food have high life span, so no rush.\n\nBut I need to think long term.\n\nIf I go D to (4,3) now.\n\n(4,3) is empty, no food or obstacle.\n\nThen from (4,3), direction would be D (since I moved down).\n\nThen I can move U, D, L, R? Direction D, so opposite is U, so cannot move up immediately? No: moving down from (4,4) to (4,3), head direction becomes D.\n\nThen from (4,3), possible moves: U to (4,4), but (4,4) might be empty, but U is opposite to current direction D? Current direction after move is D, so moving U would be reverse, not allowed.\n\nCannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\n\nSo from (4,3) with direction D, I can move D to (4,2), L to (3,3), R to (5,3). Cannot move U.\n\nNow, (5,3) has food, so I could go to (5,3) directly from (4,3) by moving right.\n\nBut let's compare the two options.\n\nFirst, if I move R now to (5,4), then next turn I can move D to (5,3) to eat the food.\n\nAfter eating, snake grows to length 2. Head at (5,3), tail at (5,4)? Positions: when at (5,4), snake is [(5,4)]. Move D to (5,3), eat food, so snake becomes [(5,3), (5,4)] with head at (5,3), direction D.\n\nThen I need to move from there.\n\nIf I move D now to (4,3), then from (4,3) I can move R to (5,3) to eat food directly.\n\nSo in both cases, I can reach (5,3) in two moves, but with different paths.\n\nPath 1: Turn 2: R to (5,4), Turn 3: D to (5,3) eat food.\n\nPath 2: Turn 2: D to (4,3), Turn 3: R to (5,3) eat food.\n\nIn both cases, I eat the food on turn 3.\n\nBut after eating, the snake will be length 2, with positions depending on the path.\n\nIn path 1: after turn 3, snake positions: head (5,3), body (5,4)\n\nDirection down.\n\nIn path 2: after turn 3, head (5,3), body (4,3)? Let's see: start turn 2: snake at (4,4). Move D to (4,3), now snake at [(4,3)]. Then move R to (5,3), eat food, so snake grows to [(5,3), (4,3)].\n\nSo positions: head (5,3), body (4,3), direction right (since moved right).\n\nNow, which is better? I need to think about future moves.\n\nAlso, there is another food at (4,1), which is below.\n\nBut there are obstacles around.\n\nLet me sketch a grid.\n\nY from 0 to 7, X from 0 to 7.\n\nRow y=0: wall\n\ny=1: cells x=0 to 7, but (3,1) is obstacle, so not accessible.\n\ny=2: (2,2) and (3,2) obstacles, so x=2,y=2 and x=3,y=2 blocked.\n\ny=3: all clear except borders? x=0 and x=7 walls, but internal? No obstacles at y=3.\n\ny=4: snake at (4,4), obstacles? (4,5) is at y=5, so y=4 clear except borders.\n\ny=5: (4,5) obstacle.\n\ny=6: (3,6) obstacle.\n\ny=7: wall.\n\nNow, food:\n\n(5,3) at x=5,y=3\n\n(4,1) at x=4,y=1 but y=1 has obstacle at (3,1), and (4,1) is free? (4,1) is listed as food, so it should be accessible, but (3,1) is obstacle, so to reach (4,1), I need to go through (4,2) or something.\n\n(4,1): x=4,y=1. Is there obstacle? Internal obstacles include (3,1), but (4,1) is not listed, so it should be free.\n\nBut (4,1) is at y=1, which is above y=0 wall.\n\nSimilarly, (1,6) at x=1,y=6\n\n(1,2) at x=1,y=2\n\nBut y=2 has obstacles at (2,2) and (3,2), so (1,2) might be accessible from left.\n\nBack to decision.\n\nIf I eat (5,3) on turn 3, as above.\n\nThen, after that, I need to find next food.\n\n(4,1) is close, but at (4,1), y=1.\n\nFrom (5,3), after eating, snake length 2.\n\nIn path 1: positions head (5,3), body (5,4), direction D.\n\nAvailable moves: since direction D, cannot move U (up). Can move D to (5,2), L to (4,3), R to (6,3).\n\n(5,2) is free? y=2, x=5. Obstacles at (2,2) and (3,2), but (5,2) should be free.\n\n(4,3) free, (6,3) free except borders.\n\n(6,3) is x=6,y=3, x=6 is border? x=7 is wall, so x=6 is ok, but x=7 wall, so x=6 is within.\n\nx from 0 to 7, walls at x=0 and x=7, so x=1 to x=6 are free except internal obstacles.\n\nSimilarly y=1 to y=6.\n\ny=0 and y=7 walls.\n\nNow, (4,1) is below, at y=1.\n\nFrom (5,3), I can move D to (5,2), then D to (5,1), but (5,1) is at y=1, then to (4,1) I need to move left, but from (5,1), I can move L to (4,1).\n\nBut let's see if there are obstacles.\n\n(5,1) should be free, no obstacle mentioned.\n\nBut y=1 has obstacle at (3,1), but (5,1) is different.\n\nSimilarly, (4,1) is food.\n\nBut to go to (4,1) from (5,3), I can go (5,3) -> (5,2) -> (5,1) -> (4,1) or (5,3) -> (4,3) -> (4,2) -> (4,1), etc.\n\nBut there might be issues with body.\n\nFirst, let's consider the immediate choice.\n\nI also have the option not to eat (5,3) immediately and go for other food, but that seems inefficient since it's close.\n\n(4,1) is also close, but to reach (4,1) from (4,4), I might need to go down.\n\nFor example, from (4,4), if I go D to (4,3), then I can go to (4,2) or (5,3), but (4,2) is at y=2, x=4.\n\ny=2 has obstacles at (2,2) and (3,2), but (4,2) should be free? x=4,y=2.\n\nInternal obstacles: (2,2) and (3,2), so (4,2) is free.\n\nSimilarly, (4,1) free.\n\nBut to go to (4,1) from (4,3), I can move D to (4,2), then D to (4,1), but from (4,3) with direction D, I can move D to (4,2), then from there direction D, move D to (4,1), eat food.\n\nBut (4,1) has food, so if I go directly down.\n\nFrom current position (4,4), if I move D to (4,3), then on turn 3 move D to (4,2), then on turn 4 move D to (4,1) to eat food.\n\nBut when I move to (4,1), I eat the food, snake grows.\n\nBut let's see the life span: (4,1) has life span 8 at turn 2, so it exists until turn 9, so I can eat it later.\n\nSimilarly, (5,3) exists until turn 9.\n\nBut since I'm at (4,4), (5,3) is closer in terms of Manhattan distance.\n\n(5,3) is |5-4| + |3-4| = 1 + 1 = 2 steps away.\n\n(4,1) is |4-4| + |1-4| = 0 + 3 = 3 steps away.\n\n(1,6) and (1,2) are far.\n\nSo (5,3) is the closest.\n\nI should eat (5,3) first.\n\nThen after that, go for (4,1).\n\nBut let's see the board.\n\nThere is an obstacle at (4,5), which is above, but we're going down.\n\nAlso, the food at (1,6) and (1,2) might be harder to reach, but I can go later.\n\nNow, back to the two paths to (5,3).\n\nPath A: Turn 2: R to (5,4), Turn 3: D to (5,3) eat.\n\nAfter this, snake at [(5,3), (5,4)] head at (5,3), direction D.\n\nPath B: Turn 2: D to (4,3), Turn 3: R to (5,3) eat.\n\nAfter this, snake at [(5,3), (4,3)] head at (5,3), direction R.\n\nNow, from here, I want to go to (4,1).\n\n(4,1) is at (4,1), which is left and down from (5,3).\n\nIn path A, from (5,3) with body at (5,4), direction D.\n\nI can move L to (4,3), D to (5,2), or R to (6,3).\n\n(4,3) is free, (5,2) free, (6,3) free.\n\nTo go to (4,1), I need to go left and down.\n\nMoving L to (4,3) would be good, then from (4,3) I can go down.\n\nBut from (5,3), if I move L to (4,3), that's left, but current direction is D, moving left is not opposite, so allowed.\n\nThen head to (4,3), direction L.\n\nBody at (5,3) and (5,4)? Positions: after move, head at (4,3), body at (5,3), since tail was at (5,4), but when head moves to (4,3), the body moves, so tail moves from (5,4) to (5,3)? Snake positions: before move, [(5,3), (5,4)] head (5,3).\n\nMove L to (4,3), so new head (4,3), and body: the segment at (5,3) becomes the new body, and (5,4) is vacated. So snake becomes [(4,3), (5,3)].\n\nDirection L.\n\nThen from (4,3), I can move L, D, R, U? Direction L, so cannot move R (opposite). Can move L to (3,3), D to (4,2), U to (4,4).\n\n(4,2) is down, towards (4,1).\n\nThen move D to (4,2), then D to (4,1) to eat.\n\nSimilarly, from (4,3), move D to (4,2), etc.\n\nIn path B, after eating at (5,3), snake at [(5,3), (4,3)] head (5,3) direction R.\n\nThen to go to (4,1), I can move D to (5,2), or L to (4,3) but (4,3) is the body segment, so moving to (4,3) would be collision? Positions: head at (5,3), body at (4,3). If I move L to (4,3), that's where the body is, so head touches body, collision, death.\n\nCannot move left to (4,3) because it's occupied by body.\n\nAvailable moves: from (5,3) direction R, can move U, D, R? Direction R, so opposite L not allowed? Cannot move opposite, but moving L is left, which is opposite to R? Current direction R, moving L is reverse, not allowed anyway.\n\nSo cannot move L.\n\nCan move U to (5,4), but (5,4) might be empty? After moving to (5,3) from (5,4) in path B? In path B, when we moved to (5,3), the previous position was (4,3) for the body.\n\nAt turn 3, after move R to (5,3), snake is [(5,3), (4,3)], head (5,3) direction R.\n\nNow, body is at (4,3).\n\nPossible moves: direction R, so cannot move L (opposite). Can move U to (5,4), D to (5,2), R to (6,3).\n\n(5,4) is empty, since we moved from there? In path B, we came from (4,3), not from (5,4). (5,4) was occupied only in path A.\n\nIn this case, (5,4) is empty.\n\nSimilarly, (5,2) empty, (6,3) empty.\n\nTo go to (4,1), moving D to (5,2) is one step down, then I need to go left and down.\n\nBut from (5,2), I can move L to (4,2), then D to (4,1).\n\nBut in path A, I could go directly to (4,3) then down.\n\nIn terms of reaching (4,1), both paths can do it, but in path B, from (5,3) I cannot move left directly to (4,3) because it's the body, so I have to go down or right or up.\n\nIf I go D to (5,2), then to (4,2), then to (4,1).\n\n(4,2) is at y=2, which is ok.\n\nBut there might be a problem with the obstacle at (3,2) and (2,2), but (4,2) is free.\n\nSimilarly, (4,1) is free.\n\nBut let's see if I can go to (4,1) from (4,2).\n\nNow, comparing the two initial choices.\n\nIf I choose path A (go right first to (5,4), then down to (5,3)), after eating, I can move left to (4,3) easily.\n\nIn path B (go down to (4,3), then right to (5,3)), after eating, I cannot move left to (4,3) because it's the body, so I have to go down or other directions, which might take more turns or be riskier.\n\nFor example, to reach (4,1) from (5,3) in path B, I need to go to (5,2) then (4,2) then (4,1), three moves, whereas in path A, I can go to (4,3) in one move, then to (4,2) then (4,1), also two or three moves to eat, but the point is that in path B, I'm stuck at (5,3) with body blocking the left, so I have to go around.\n\nMoreover, (4,1) is at (4,1), so from (5,3) in path B, going to (5,2) then (4,2) then (4,1) is fine, but it's an extra move compared to if I were at (4,3).\n\nBut let's count the turns to eat (4,1).\n\nAssume turn 3: ate (5,3)\n\nThen for path A: turn 4, move L to (4,3). Now at (4,3), body at (5,3). Direction L.\n\nThen turn 5, move D to (4,2). At (4,2), body at (4,3) and (5,3)? Positions: from [(4,3), (5,3)] move D to (4,2), so head (4,2), body (4,3), tail (5,3) moves to (4,3)? Snake: before move, [(4,3), (5,3)] head (4,3). Move D to (4,2), so new head (4,2), body: (4,3) becomes segment, and (5,3) becomes next, but since length 2, positions: head (4,2), body (4,3). Tail was at (5,3), but when head moves, tail moves to the previous body position? Standard snake: when snake moves, head goes to new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the next segment.\n\nSince length 2: positions S0 (head), S1 (tail).\n\nMove to new head position, S1 moves to old S0.\n\nSo before move: head S0 at (4,3), tail S1 at (5,3)\n\nAfter move down to (4,2): new head at (4,2), tail moves to (4,3), so snake [(4,2), (4,3)]\n\nDirection D.\n\nThen turn 6, move D to (4,1) to eat food. At (4,1), grow to length 3, positions [(4,1), (4,2), (4,3)]\n\nAte (4,1) on turn 6.\n\nNow in path B: after turn 3, at [(5,3), (4,3)] head (5,3) dir R.\n\nTurn 4, move D to (5,2). Now head (5,2), body (5,3), tail moved to (5,3)? Before move: head (5,3), tail (4,3)\n\nMove D to (5,2): new head (5,2), tail moves to (5,3), so snake [(5,2), (5,3)]\n\nDirection D.\n\nThen turn 5, move L to (4,2). Current direction D, moving L is allowed? Left is not opposite to down, so yes. Move to (4,2), head (4,2), body (5,2), tail to (5,2)? Positions: before move [(5,2), (5,3)] head (5,2)\n\nMove L to (4,2): new head (4,2), tail moves to (5,2), so snake [(4,2), (5,2)]\n\nDirection L.\n\nThen turn 6, move D to (4,1)? (4,1) is down from (4,2). Current direction L, moving D is down, not opposite, so allowed. Move to (4,1), eat food, grow to [(4,1), (4,2), (5,2)]\n\nAlso ate on turn 6.\n\nSame number of turns.\n\nBut in path B, when moving to (4,2) on turn 5, (4,2) was empty, no issue.\n\nHowever, in this case, both work, but in path A, after eating (5,3), I was able to move directly to (4,3), which is closer to (4,1), whereas in path B, I had to go to (5,2) first.\n\nBut same turns to eat (4,1).\n\nNow, but there is another consideration: the food at (4,1) might be eaten earlier if I go directly, but I have to eat (5,3) first or something.\n\nAnother thing: in path B, when I moved to (4,3) on turn 2, I didn't eat anything, just moved, whereas in path A, on turn 2 I moved to (5,4), not eating.\n\nBut both eat on turn 3.\n\nNow, long term, after eating both, I need to go to other food like (1,6) or (1,2).\n\nBut let's see the obstacles.\n\nThere is an obstacle at (3,1), (2,2), (3,2) on the left, so to go to (1,2) or (1,6), I might need to go around.\n\nAlso, (4,5) and (3,6) above, but we're going down.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the risk.\n\nAnother point: the tail reward danger. But since the snake is short, and no food under tail yet, probably not an issue.\n\nBut let's think about the board layout.\n\nThe area around (4,4) has obstacles above and left.\n\nFor example, from (4,4), moving R to (5,4) is open, moving D to (4,3) is also open.\n\nBut if I go to (5,4), then I can access the right side, while if I go to (4,3), I can access the bottom.\n\nBut (4,3) is closer to (4,1).\n\nHowever, since I can eat (5,3) quickly in both cases, it might not matter.\n\nBut let's see the food at (1,6) and (1,2).\n\n(1,6) is top-left, (1,2) is bottom-left.\n\nTo reach (1,2), I need to go left, but there are obstacles at (2,2) and (3,2), so I can only access (1,2) from above or below, but y=2, (1,2) is at x=1,y=2.\n\nThe cells around: (1,1), (1,3), (2,2) is obstacle, so from (1,1) or (1,3), I can reach (1,2), since (2,2) blocked.\n\nSimilarly, (1,6) at x=1,y=6, obstacle at (3,6), but (1,6) can be reached from (1,5) or (1,7) but y=7 wall, so from (1,5) or (2,6), etc.\n\nBut (3,6) obstacle, so the left side might be constrained.\n\nPerhaps it's better to eat (5,3) first, then (4,1), then decide.\n\nBut I need to choose the first move.\n\nAnother thing: the life span of (1,2) is 9, longer, so I can eat it later.\n\nSimilarly, all have high life.\n\nBut to maximize score, I should eat as many as possible, so I need to plan a path to multiple food.\n\nBut with obstacles, it might be tricky.\n\nList the food: (5,3), (4,1), (1,6), (1,2)\n\nFrom current position, after eating (5,3) and (4,1), I can go to (1,2) or (1,6).\n\nFor example, after being at (4,1) with length 3, I can move left to (3,1), but (3,1) is obstacle! (3,1) is an internal obstacle, so I cannot go there.\n\nFrom (4,1), with positions say [(4,1), (4,2), (4,3)] or something, but direction down.\n\nFrom (4,1), I can move U, D, L, R? But y=1, so D to (4,0) is wall, cannot. U to (4,2), L to (3,1) but (3,1) obstacle, cannot. R to (5,1), or U to (4,2).\n\nR to (5,1) is possible, or U to (4,2).\n\nIf I go to (5,1), then I can go to (6,1) etc, but to reach (1,2), I need to go left, but at y=1, I can go to (2,1), then (1,1), then to (1,2) from (1,1) by moving up.\n\n(1,1) is at x=1,y=1, which is corner, but free except borders.\n\nFrom (1,1), I can move U to (1,2) to eat the food.\n\nSimilarly, from (4,1), I can go U to (4,2), then L to (3,2) but (3,2) obstacle, cannot. So from (4,2), I can move L? (3,2) obstacle, so cannot move left. U to (4,3) but that might be body, or D to (4,1) but that's body if I'm at (4,2), etc.\n\nFrom (4,2), with head, I can move U to (4,3), D to (4,1), L to (3,2) but (3,2) obstacle, cannot, R to (5,2).\n\nSo only U, D, R.\n\nIf I move R to (5,2), then to (5,1), etc.\n\nTo reach (1,2), I need to go to the left via y=1 or y=3.\n\nSince y=2 is blocked at x=2 and x=3.\n\nSo from (4,1), I can move R to (5,1), then to (6,1), etc, but that's away from (1,2).\n\nOr move U to (4,2), then from (4,2) I can only move U or R, not left, so I have to go up to (4,3), then from (4,3) I can move L to (3,3), etc.\n\nFrom (4,3), I can move L to (3,3), then to (2,3), (1,3), then down to (1,2).\n\nOr from (1,3) to (1,2).\n\nSimilarly, to reach (1,6), from top.\n\nBut let's not get ahead.\n\nFor the first move, since both paths to (5,3) are similar, but in path A, when I go to (5,4) first, I am at (5,4), which is higher y, and (5,3) is below, so moving down to it.\n\nIn path B, I go to (4,3) first, which is lower, then right to (5,3).\n\nBut after eating, in path A, I am at (5,3) with body above at (5,4), so I can move left freely to (4,3).\n\nIn path B, I am at (5,3) with body left at (4,3), so I cannot move left, have to move down or right.\n\nMoving down to (5,2) is towards (4,1), so it might be better for going to (4,1).\n\nIn path B, from (5,3), I move D to (5,2), which is directly towards (4,1), whereas in path A, I move L to (4,3), which is also towards (4,1), but (4,3) is at same y as (5,3), while (5,2) is lower.\n\nFrom (5,2), I can go directly to (4,2) then (4,1), while from (4,3), I go to (4,2) then (4,1), same thing.\n\nBut in terms of position, (5,2) is closer to (4,1) in y-direction.\n\nManhattan: from (5,2) to (4,1) is |4-5| + |1-2| =1+1=2\n\nFrom (4,3) to (4,1) is |4-4| + |1-3| =0+2=2, same.\n\nSo no difference.\n\nBut there is a food at (1,2), which is far.\n\nAnother consideration: the obstacle at (4,5) is above, but we're not going there.\n\nPerhaps I should consider going for (4,1) first instead of (5,3).\n\nFrom (4,4), move D to (4,3), then D to (4,2), then D to (4,1) to eat on turn 4.\n\nThen snake at [(4,1), (4,2), (4,3)] or something.\n\nBut on turn 2 move D to (4,3), turn 3 move D to (4,2), turn 4 move D to (4,1) eat.\n\nAfter that, head at (4,1), direction D.\n\nThen to go to (5,3), I need to go up and right.\n\nFrom (4,1), I can move U to (4,2), but (4,2) is the body if snake is [(4,1), (4,2), (4,3)]? After eating at (4,1), positions: before move, say at turn 3, after move to (4,2), snake is at [(4,2)] if length 1, but let's trace.\n\nTurn 2: start at (4,4), move D to (4,3), snake now [(4,3)] length 1.\n\nTurn 3: move D to (4,2), snake [(4,2)] length 1.\n\nTurn 4: move D to (4,1), eat food, snake grows to [(4,1), (4,2)] length 2, head (4,1) direction D.\n\nThen from here, to go to (5,3), I can move R to (5,1), then U to (5,2), then U to (5,3), for example.\n\nTurn 5: move R to (5,1), head (5,1), body (4,1), direction R.\n\nTurn 6: move U to (5,2), head (5,2), body (5,1), direction U.\n\nTurn 7: move U to (5,3), eat food, head (5,3), body (5,2), and grow, length 3.\n\nAte (5,3) on turn 7.\n\nWhereas if I ate (5,3) first on turn 3, then (4,1) on turn 6, as earlier.\n\nBy eating (5,3) first, I eat it on turn 3 and (4,1) on turn 6.\n\nBy eating (4,1) first, I eat it on turn 4 and (5,3) on turn 7.\n\nSo eating (5,3) first gives me the food earlier, so I can start moving to other food sooner.\n\nAlso, the score increases earlier.\n\nMoreover, (5,3) is closer.\n\nSo better to eat (5,3) first.\n\nTherefore, for turn 2, I should move towards (5,3), either R or D.\n\nBut moving R to (5,4) or D to (4,3).\n\nNow, between these, in terms of future flexibility, moving R to (5,4) might be better because it allows me to access the right side, and after eating (5,3), I can easily move left to (4,3) to go down.\n\nMoving D to (4,3) first, I am at (4,3), then I move R to (5,3), but after that, body is at (4,3), so I cannot move left, have to move down or other.\n\nBut since I want to go down to (4,1), moving down is good.\n\nIn fact, in path B, after eating at (5,3), I directly move D to (5,2) towards (4,1).\n\nIn path A, I move L to (4,3), which is not directly down.\n\nBut both work.\n\nTo avoid potential issues, let's see if there are any risks.\n\nFor example, in the area around (4,3) and (5,3), no obstacles, so both are safe.\n\nAnother food is (1,6) and (1,2), with (1,2) having longer life span.\n\nAfter eating (5,3) and (4,1), I can go to (1,2) or (1,6).\n\n(1,2) might be easier to reach from bottom.\n\nFrom (4,1), I can move L but blocked, so move to (5,1), then (6,1), but that's right, away from left.\n\nOr move U to (4,2), then from (4,2) I can only move U or R, so to (4,3), then to (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), then down to (1,2).\n\nSimilarly, from (1,3) to (1,2) is down.\n\nNow, (1,3) is free.\n\nSimilarly, to (1,6), I can go from (1,3) up to (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), but need to avoid obstacles.\n\n(3,6) obstacle at y=6,x=3, but (1,6) is at x=1, so no direct issue.\n\nBut let's not optimize that far.\n\nFor the first move, I think moving R to (5,4) is fine.\n\nOr D to (4,3).\n\nBut let's see the head direction.\n\nCurrent direction R.\n\nIf I move R to (5,4), direction remains R.\n\nIf I move D to (4,3), direction becomes D.\n\nThen for next move, it affects.\n\nBut I think it's minor.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the food at (1,6) and (1,2).\n\n(1,6) is at y=6, which is higher, while we are at y=4.\n\n(1,2) at y=2, lower.\n\nAfter eating nearby food, I might go to (1,2) first since it's lower and closer in y to (4,1).\n\nFrom (4,1) to (1,2): Manhattan |1-4| + |2-1| = 3+1=4, or with obstacles, more.\n\nSimilarly to (1,6): |1-4| + |6-1| =3+5=8, farther.\n\nSo (1,2) is closer.\n\nBut life span of (1,2) is 9, so until turn 10, (1,6) life span 8 until turn 9.\n\nTurn 2 now, so both have time.\n\nBut to be efficient, after eating (5,3) and (4,1), go to (1,2).\n\nFrom (4,1), as above.\n\nNow, back to turn 2 decision.\n\nI think I should move R to (5,4) to eat (5,3) next turn.\n\nThen from there, move D to (5,3) to eat.\n\nThen move L to (4,3) to position for going down to (4,1).\n\nThen D to (4,2), D to (4,1) eat.\n\nThen from (4,1), move U to (4,2), but (4,2) might be body, so need to move to other direction.\n\nAfter eating at (4,1), snake at [(4,1), (4,2)] head (4,1) dir D.\n\nThen I can move U to (4,2)? But (4,2) is the body, so collision if I move there.\n\nCannot move to body.\n\nAvailable moves: from (4,1) dir D, cannot move U (up, opposite), can move D but y=0 wall, cannot. L to (3,1) obstacle, cannot. R to (5,1).\n\nSo only move R to (5,1).\n\nThen from (5,1), etc.\n\nThen to go to (1,2), I need to go left.\n\nMove to (6,1), etc, but that's away.\n\nFrom (4,1), after eating, I am forced to move right to (5,1), since other directions blocked.\n\nThen from (5,1), I can move U to (5,2), then to (5,3) but that might be occupied or not, etc.\n\nThen to go left, I can move to (5,2), then L to (4,2), but (4,2) might be free.\n\nFrom (5,1) dir R (since moved right), can move U, D, R.\n\nD to (5,0) wall, cannot. U to (5,2), R to (6,1).\n\nSo move U to (5,2).\n\nThen from (5,2), can move U to (5,3), L to (4,2), R to (6,2), etc.\n\nThen move L to (4,2), then from (4,2), can move U to (4,3), L but (3,2) obstacle, D to (4,1) body, so only U or R.\n\nMove U to (4,3), then from (4,3) can move L to (3,3), U to (4,4), etc.\n\nThen to (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), then D to (1,2).\n\nSo it's possible, but takes many turns.\n\nIf I had gone to (4,3) earlier, I could be in a better position.\n\nBut in the initial choice, for eating (5,3), if I choose path B, go D to (4,3) first, then to (5,3), then after eating at (5,3), I move D to (5,2), then to (5,1) or (4,2), but to (4,1).\n\nFrom (5,3) in path B, move D to (5,2), then from (5,2) I can move L to (4,2), then D to (4,1) to eat.\n\nAfter eating at (4,1), I am at (4,1) with body at (4,2) and possibly (5,2) or something.\n\nLet's simulate.\n\nTurn 2: D to (4,3)\n\nTurn 3: R to (5,3) eat, snake [(5,3), (4,3)] head (5,3) dir R\n\nTurn 4: move D to (5,2), snake [(5,2), (5,3)] head (5,2) dir D\n\nTurn 5: move L to (4,2), snake [(4,2), (5,2)] head (4,2) dir L\n\nTurn 6: move D to (4,1) eat, snake [(4,1), (4,2), (5,2)] head (4,1) dir D\n\nNow, from (4,1), as before, only can move R to (5,1), since other directions blocked.\n\nSame as before.\n\nNo difference.\n\nSo for the first move, I think moving R to (5,4) is acceptable.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the long-term path to eat all food.\n\nBut it might be complex.\n\nSince the snake is short, I can be flexible.\n\nAnother idea: after eating (5,3), instead of going directly to (4,1), I could go for other food, but (4,1) is close.\n\n(1,6) is far, so better to eat nearby first.\n\nI think for turn 2, I'll move R to (5,4).\n\nThen turn 3, move D to (5,3) to eat.\n\nThen for turn 4, move L to (4,3).\n\nThen turn 5, move D to (4,2).\n\nTurn 6, move D to (4,1) to eat.\n\nThen from there, move R to (5,1), and so on.\n\nBut I need to output actions for 5+ turns.\n\nThe answer format is to provide actions from turn t1 to t1+4 or something, but it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" and \"answer format: Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\"\n\nBut it doesn't specify how many turns to output. Probably a few turns, but since it says think ahead, I should plan the sequence.\n\nPerhaps output 5 turns of actions.\n\nCurrent turn t1=2.\n\nSo for turns 2,3,4,5,6.\n\nNow, for turn 2, action.\n\nLet me decide.\n\nI think move R to (5,4).\n\nThen turn 3, from (5,4) move D to (5,3) eat.\n\nThen turn 4, from (5,3) with body (5,4), move L to (4,3).\n\nThen turn 5, from (4,3) with body (5,3), move D to (4,2). Direction after moving L to (4,3) is L, so move D to (4,2), not opposite.\n\nThen turn 6, from (4,2) with body (4,3), move D to (4,1) eat.\n\nBut turn 6 is t1+4, since t1=2, t1+4=6.\n\nI need to include turn 2 to turn 6.\n\nBut after turn 6, I eat (4,1), but I should think further.\n\nFor the answer, I can output up to turn 6.\n\nBut let's see if this is safe.\n\nAre there any risks?\n\nFor example, when moving to (4,3) on turn 4, is it safe? Yes.\n\n(4,2) on turn 5, safe.\n\n(4,1) on turn 6, safe.\n\nAfter that, I can go for (1,2) or (1,6).\n\nBut for the plan, it should be fine.\n\nIf I move D first on turn 2, to (4,3), then turn 3 R to (5,3) eat, turn 4 D to (5,2), turn 5 L to (4,2), turn 6 D to (4,1) eat.\n\nSame thing, but in this case, on turn 4 I am at (5,2), which is lower.\n\nBut similar.\n\nI think moving R first is slightly better because it keeps me on the same y-level initially.\n\nNo strong reason.\n\nAnother point: the food at (4,1) might be under something, but no.\n\nI think I'll go with moving R.\n\nSo for turn 2: R\n\nThen the sequence.\n\nBut in the output, I need to specify the actions.\n\nAlso, for turn 3, when I move to (5,3), I eat the food, so score +1.\n\nThen on turn 6, eat another.\n\nNow, for the next food, say (1,2), I can plan to go there.\n\nBut for the answer, I can provide actions for turns 2 to 6.\n\nSince the snake is short, and no immediate danger, this should be fine.\n\nTo think 5+ turns ahead, I have thought to turn 6 and eating two food.\n\nSo I think it's ok.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while ensuring long-term survival, I have planned a sequence of moves for the next 5 turns (turns 2 to 6) based on the current state. The plan prioritizes eating the positive food at (5,3) first due to its proximity, then moves toward (4,1) for the next food. I considered the following:\n\n- **Current snake state**: Only the head at (4,4), direction right. No body segments exist, so collision risks are minimal initially, but the snake will grow after eating.\n- **Food prioritization**: (5,3) is the closest food (Manhattan distance = 2), and (4,1) is the next closest (distance = 3 from (4,4)). Both have sufficient life span (disappear after turn 9), so no immediate rush, but eating sooner allows more time for later food. (1,6) and (1,2) are farther and will be targeted after turn 6.\n- **Obstacles and walls**: Internal obstacles block direct paths (e.g., (3,1), (2,2), (3,2) near (4,1)), so paths must avoid these. Borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are deadly.\n- **Movement constraints**: Current direction is right, so left (reverse) is forbidden on turn 2. After moves, new directions are considered to prevent illegal reversals.\n- **Risk avoidance**: After eating, the snake grows, increasing collision risk. The path to (4,1) is designed to avoid tight spaces near obstacles. After turn 6, the snake can head toward (1,2) via (5,1) and leftward moves, leveraging the longer life span of (1,2) (disappears after turn 10).\n- **5+ turn plan**: The sequence eats (5,3) on turn 3 and (4,1) on turn 6, adding +2 to the score. By turn 6, the snake will be at (4,1) with length 3, positioned to access the left side of the grid for future food.\n\n### Action Sequence\n- **Turn 2**: Move **R (right)** to (5,4). *Reasoning: From (4,4), moving right avoids the obstacle at (4,5) and positions the snake to eat (5,3) next turn. Reverse (left) is forbidden, and down would delay reaching (5,3).*\n- **Turn 3**: Move **D (down)** to (5,3) to eat the food (+1 score). *Reasoning: Eating (5,3) now maximizes early score gain. Snake grows to length 2, with positions [(5,3), (5,4)] and direction down.*\n- **Turn 4**: Move **L (left)** to (4,3). *Reasoning: From (5,3) with direction down, left is allowed and not reverse. This moves toward (4,1) while avoiding the body segment at (5,4). Snake positions: [(4,3), (5,3)], direction left.*\n- **Turn 5**: Move **D (down)** to (4,2). *Reasoning: Direction is left, so down is not reverse. This continues toward (4,1) safely. Snake positions: [(4,2), (4,3)], direction down.*\n- **Turn 6**: Move **D (down)** to (4,1) to eat the food (+1 score). *Reasoning: Eats (4,1) efficiently. Snake grows to length 3, with positions [(4,1), (4,2), (4,3)] and direction down. From here, the snake can move right to (5,1) on turn 7 to begin accessing (1,2).*\n\n### Long-Term Considerations (Beyond Turn 6)\n- After turn 6, the snake should target (1,2) by moving right to (5,1), then left along y=1 to (1,1), and up to (1,2). This path avoids obstacles like (3,1) and (2,2) by staying low. (1,2) has a life span until turn 10, so there is time.\n- (1,6) can be eaten later by moving up the left side after (1,2), but (1,6) disappears after turn 9, so it should be prioritized if possible.\n- Risks: After growing, body collisions become a concern. The path avoids the clustered obstacles near (3,1)-(3,2) and uses open areas. Tail reward danger is irrelevant here as no food is under the tail.\n- If no food is eaten, the snake must still move to survive, but this plan ensures food is consumed efficiently.\n\nThis plan scores +2 by turn 6 with minimal risk, setting up for further food collection.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 2: R (right)\nTurn 3: D (down)\nTurn 4: L (left)\nTurn 5: D (down)\nTurn 6: D (down)\n}",

So the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), but with internal obstacles.\n\nInternal obstacles: (3,2), (4,5), (3,6), (3,1), (2,2). So these cells are blocked and I can't move there.\n\nSnake positions: only [(5,4)]. That means the snake is just one segment long? Snake positions are given as a list, starting with the head. Here it's only one position: (5,4). So yes, the snake has no body, just a head. That makes sense for the start, I guess, but the current turn is 3, so maybe it has eaten something? But the positions show only (5,4), so it must be length 1.\n\nSnake head direction is R, which is right, so moving towards increasing x.\n\nFood positions:\n\n- (5,3) with life span 7, value 1 (positive food)\n\n- (4,1) with life span 7, value 1\n\n- (1,6) with life span 7, value 1\n\n- (1,2) with life span 8, value 1\n\nAll food is positive, no negative food mentioned. Value 1 and life span given; all have value 1, so all are positive.\n\nNow, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks. Since the snake is only one segment, it can grow by eating food.\n\nCurrent position: head at (5,4), moving right. So possible moves: U, D, L, R. But I can't move left because that's opposite to current direction (R), so no instant reverse. So allowed moves: U, D, R. L is not allowed.\n\nBut R: if I move right, to (6,4). Is that a wall? x=7 is wall, so x from 1 to 6, I think. Walls are at x=0 and x=7, so x=7 is wall, so (7,y) is invalid. Similarly, (x,0) and (x,7) for y walls.\n\nGrid: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, since walls at 0 and 7.\n\nSo (5,4) moving R to (6,4). (6,4) is within bounds, x=6,y=4, not a wall since walls are at x=0,7 and y=0,7, so (6,4) should be okay, but I need to check obstacles.\n\nObstacles: (3,2), (4,5), (3,6), (3,1), (2,2). None at (6,4), so moving R to (6,4) is possible.\n\nU: up to (5,5)\n\nD: down to (5,3)\n\n(5,3) has food! Positive food at (5,3) with life span 7.\n\nIf I move down to (5,3), I eat the food. Since snake is length 1, eating food will make it grow to length 2. The head moves to (5,3), and since it was length 1, after eating, the body segment will be at the previous position, which is (5,4). So snake becomes [(5,3), (5,4)].\n\nThen, since I ate food, I get +1 score.\n\nBut I need to think about future moves.\n\nAlso, food life span: each turn, life span decreases, including current turn? The rule says: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nFor food at (5,3), life span 7 at turn 3. After turn 3, if not eaten, life span becomes 6, and so on.\n\nIf I move to (5,3) on turn 3, I eat it, so it disappears.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, options for turn 3:\n\n- Move U to (5,5)\n\n- Move D to (5,3) to eat food\n\n- Move R to (6,4)\n\nL is not allowed since opposite direction.\n\nNow, I need to plan multiple turns ahead.\n\nFirst, let's sketch the grid.\n\nGrid size: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n\nWalls: borders at x=0,7 and y=0,7, so no need to list, but internal obstacles:\n\n(3,2), (4,5), (3,6), (3,1), (2,2)\n\nList them:\n\n- (3,1)\n\n- (2,2)\n\n- (3,2)\n\n- (4,5)\n\n- (3,6)\n\n(3,1) and (3,2) are both obstacles, and (2,2), (3,6), (4,5).\n\nFood:\n\n- (5,3) - below current position\n\n- (4,1) - left and down\n\n- (1,6) - far left, top\n\n- (1,2) - far left, bottomish\n\ny=6 is top, y=1 is bottom? Typically y increases up, but in coordinates, it might be arbitrary, but here walls y=0 and y=7, so y=1 is bottom, y=6 is top? Not specified, but I'll assume y=1 is bottom, y=6 is top for simplicity, but it doesn't matter as long as consistent.\n\nIn the state, snake head at (5,4), and food at (5,3) which is lower y, so if y increases up, then (5,3) is down; if y increases down, it would be up, but I think it's standard to have y increase up, but in grid coordinates, it might vary. I'll assume y=1 is bottom row, y=6 is top row for clarity.\n\nSimilarly, x=1 left, x=6 right.\n\nSo current head: (5,4) - middle right area.\n\nFood at (5,3) - directly below, one cell down.\n\n(4,1) - left and down, near bottom left.\n\n(1,6) - top left.\n\n(1,2) - bottom left.\n\nNow, snake direction R, so moving right.\n\nFor turn 3, I can move U, D, R.\n\nIf I move D to (5,3), I eat food immediately, snake grows to length 2, positions: head (5,3), body (5,4).\n\nThen, from there, I can move to adjacent cells.\n\nBut (5,3) has food, so when I move to it, I eat it.\n\nAfter eating, the food is gone.\n\nThen for turn 4, from (5,3), I can move U, D, L, R, but with constraints.\n\nCurrent direction after moving D to (5,3) is D, since I moved down.\n\nThen for turn 4, I can't move U, opposite direction, so only L, R, D possible? Moves: from (5,3), adjacent cells:\n\n- U to (5,4) - but that's where the body is? After turn 3, snake is [(5,3), (5,4)], so head at (5,3), body at (5,4).\n\nIf I move U to (5,4), that's the body segment. But according to rules, moving into the tail segment is allowed only if the tail moves away, but let's see the collision rule.\n\n\"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo, if I move to the tail cell, it's okay because the tail moves, so no collision.\n\nIn this case, for a length 2 snake, if head moves to the tail position, and tail moves to new position, it should be fine.\n\nFor example, at turn 3 end, snake: head (5,3), body (5,4).\n\nIf on turn 4, I move U to (5,4), which is the current body position. But when I move, the head goes to (5,4), and the body moves to where? The body should follow; since it's moving, the tail was at (5,4), but head moves to (5,4), which is the same cell, but at that moment, before movement, body is at (5,4), head moves to (5,4), so they occupy same cell? But in snake, when head moves, the body segments shift.\n\nStandard snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n\nSo for length 2: positions [head, tail].\n\nAfter head moves to new position, tail moves to where head was? No.\n\nSequence: at time t, positions [p_head, p_tail].\n\nMove head to new position q.\n\nThen new positions: [q, p_head] because the tail moves to where the head was.\n\nIn this case, at turn 3 end: head at (5,3), tail at (5,4). (since only one body segment, it's the tail)\n\nOn turn 4, if I move head to (5,4), which is where the tail currently is.\n\nBut when I move, the head goes to (5,4), and the tail moves to where the head was, which is (5,3).\n\nSo new positions: head at (5,4), tail at (5,3).\n\nSo no collision, because when head moves to (5,4), the tail was at (5,4) but moves to (5,3) simultaneously, so no overlap.\n\nSimilarly, if head moves to a cell that the tail is leaving, it's fine.\n\nBut if head moves to a body segment that is not the tail, it collides.\n\nHere, with length 2, only head and tail, so moving to tail position is safe.\n\nSimilarly, in longer snakes.\n\nAlso, food under body: but here no issue.\n\nBack to decision.\n\nIf on turn 3, I move D to (5,3), eat food, snake becomes length 2: [(5,3), (5,4)]\n\nDirection now D.\n\nThen turn 4, from (5,3), I can move:\n\n- U to (5,4) - but (5,4) is the current tail, so moving there is safe, as above. After move, head to (5,4), tail to (5,3), so positions [(5,4), (5,3)]\n\n- D to (5,2) - but (5,2) is within bounds? y=2, not wall, but obstacles? Obstacles: (3,1), (2,2), (3,2), etc. (5,2) is not listed, so should be free.\n\n- L to (4,3)\n\n- R to (6,3) - x=6,y=3\n\nBut I can't move U because it's opposite to current direction D? Current direction is D, so moving U is reverse, not allowed.\n\nSo from (5,3) with direction D, possible moves: L, R, D (since U is opposite).\n\nSimilarly, if I didn't eat, other options.\n\nBut let's think long term.\n\nThere is food at (5,3) which is very close, and I can eat it now.\n\nBut also, other food: (4,1) might be reachable, but I need to avoid dying.\n\nSince snake is short, I can grow.\n\nBut there is a danger: tail reward danger. If head adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it kills.\n\nBut here, no food under tail yet.\n\nCurrent state, no body, so no issue.\n\nAfter eating, if I have body, need to be careful.\n\nAnother option: move R to (6,4) on turn 3.\n\nThen from there, I can go down or up, but (6,4) has no food.\n\nThen I might go to (6,3) or (6,5), but (6,3) is below, (6,5) above.\n\n(5,3) has food, life span 7 at turn 3. After turn 3, if not eaten, life span decreases to 6, and so on.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nI should consider the life spans.\n\nAll food has life span at least 7, and current turn 3, so they last until turn 10 or so, but I need to eat them before they disappear.\n\nBut since grid is small, I can reach them in few turns.\n\nNow, let's think about the obstacles; they block paths.\n\nFor example, to reach (4,1), which is at x=4,y=1.\n\nFrom (5,4), I can go left or down, but with obstacles.\n\nSimilarly, (1,6) is far, (1,2) far.\n\n(5,3) is very close.\n\nPerhaps I should eat (5,3) now to grow, which might help later for reaching other food.\n\nBut let's simulate multiple turns.\n\nI need to output actions for turn 3,4,5, etc., but the answer format is to list actions starting from turn 3 for several turns, but it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\" and output actions for each turn, but I think I need to output a sequence of actions for the next few turns.\n\nThe answer format is:\n\nTurn t1: action\n\nTurn t1+1: action\n\n...\n\nSo I need to decide a sequence, but since the state changes, I might need to plan a path.\n\nBut food might be eaten or disappear, so I should plan based on current state.\n\nSince no other snakes, and food static, I can plan a route.\n\nBut life span decreases, so I need to prioritize food that might disappear sooner, but all have similar life spans, 7 or 8, turn 3, so (1,2) has life span 8, others 7, so (1,2) lasts longer, but not a big difference.\n\nLife span 7 at turn 3 means it disappears after 7 turns, so on turn 10 it disappears? Let's see.\n\n\"Life-span disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nSo for food at turn t with life span L, it will disappear after L turns, meaning at the start of turn t+L, it's gone? Or after L decreases to 0.\n\nTypically, if life span decreases each turn including current, then at turn t, life span L, after turn t, it becomes L-1, and so on, until L-1=0 after some turn, it disappears.\n\nFor example, at turn 3, life span 7, so after turn 3, it becomes 6, after turn 4, 5, ..., after turn 9, it becomes 0 and disappears before turn 10? Let's define.\n\nThe rule says: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nI think it means: at the beginning of turn t, food has life span L, during the turn, if snake moves to it, it is eaten. At the end of the turn, life span decreases by 1. If after decrease, life span 0, it disappears.\n\nSo for food at (5,3), turn 3, life span 7. If not eaten on turn 3, at end of turn 3, life span becomes 6. If eaten on turn 3, it is removed.\n\nSimilarly, if life span becomes 0, it is removed.\n\nSo (5,3) with L=7 at turn 3: if not eaten by turn 9, after turn 9 it disappears (since after turn 9, L=7-7=0? From turn 3 to turn 9 is 7 turns? Turn 3: L=7, after turn 3: L=6, after turn 4: L=5, after turn 5: L=4, after turn 6: L=3, after turn 7: L=2, after turn 8: L=1, after turn 9: L=0, so it disappears before turn 10.\n\nSimilarly, for L=8 at turn 3, disappears after turn 10.\n\nBut turn 3 current, so I have time.\n\nNow back to decision.\n\nOption 1: on turn 3, move D to (5,3) and eat food.\n\nThen snake becomes length 2, positions [(5,3), (5,4)], direction D.\n\nThen for turn 4, from (5,3), I can move L to (4,3), R to (6,3), or D to (5,2), but not U (opposite).\n\nNow, food at (4,1) is below, so moving D might be good to reach it.\n\n(4,1) is at (4,1), so from (5,3), moving D to (5,2), then I can go to (4,2) or something, but obstacles.\n\nList free cells.\n\nGrid cells: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6.\n\nObstacles: (3,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,5), (3,6)\n\nSo for example, row y=1: cells (1,1), (2,1), (3,1) obstacle, (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)\n\n(4,1) has food, but (3,1) is obstacle, so from (4,1) I can go left to (3,1)? No, obstacle, so only right or up/down, but y=1 is bottom, so down not possible, only up.\n\nSimilarly, other areas.\n\nAfter eating (5,3), on turn 4, if I move D to (5,2), then (5,2) is free, no food.\n\nThen from (5,2), I can move to (4,2), (6,2), or U to (5,3), but (5,3) is now the tail, so moving U is possible, but not necessary.\n\n(5,2) to (4,2): (4,2) is free, no obstacle listed.\n\nObstacles: (2,2), (3,2), but not (4,2), so (4,2) free.\n\nThen from (4,2), I can go to (4,1) which has food, or to (3,2) but (3,2) obstacle, or (4,3), etc.\n\n(4,1) has food, so from (4,2) I can move D to (4,1) to eat it, since y=1, moving down to y=1? y=1 is bottom, so from (4,2) to (4,1) is down, assuming y increases up.\n\nIf y=1 is bottom, moving down decreases y, so from (4,2) to (4,1) is down.\n\nThen eat food at (4,1).\n\nSimilarly, other paths.\n\nBut let's think if I don't eat (5,3) now.\n\nAnother option: on turn 3, move R to (6,4).\n\nThen at (6,4), no food, direction R or whatever, but I moved R, so direction R.\n\nThen turn 4, from (6,4), I can move U to (6,5), D to (6,3), or L to (5,4), but not R, since x=6 is rightmost, moving R to x=7 is wall, not possible. So only U, D, L.\n\nL to (5,4) is back, but possible.\n\n(6,3) has no food, but (5,3) has food below.\n\nIf I move D to (6,3) on turn 4, then from (6,3) I can move L to (5,3) to eat food on turn 5.\n\nBut on turn 3, if I move R to (6,4), I don't eat on turn 3, so (5,3) life span decreases to 6 after turn 3, but still there.\n\nThen on turn 4, move D to (6,3), then turn 5 move L to (5,3) to eat.\n\nBut compared to eating on turn 3, I eat one turn later, but snake grows later.\n\nSince all food positive, eating sooner might be better to grow and reach other food faster.\n\nBut with length 1, I can move freely.\n\nBut let's consider the tail reward danger for future.\n\nAlso, there is food at (1,2) and (1,6), which are far, and I need to navigate through obstacles.\n\nObstacles at (3,1), (2,2), (3,2) block the bottom left area.\n\nFor example, to reach (1,2) from (5,4).\n\nPossible paths: down to y=1, but obstacles at (3,1) and (2,2), (3,2), so around (2,2) and (3,1-2) blocked.\n\nCells near (1,2): (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2) obstacle, (2,3), (3,1) obstacle, (3,2) obstacle, (3,3), etc.\n\nSo from (1,2), I can go to (1,1), (1,3), or (2,2) but obstacle, so not, or to (1,1) or (1,3).\n\n(2,1) is free, since obstacles are (2,2) and (3,1), so (2,1) free.\n\nSimilarly, (1,1) free, (1,3) free.\n\nTo reach (1,2), I can come from (1,1), (1,3), or (2,1), etc.\n\nBut from current position, I need to go left and down.\n\nSimilarly for (1,6), top left.\n\nObstacles at (3,6), (4,5), etc.\n\n(3,6) obstacle, (4,5) obstacle.\n\n(1,6) at top left, so cells around: (1,5), (1,6), (1,7) wall, (2,6), etc.\n\n(2,6) free? No obstacles listed at (2,6), so free.\n\n(3,6) obstacle, so from (1,6) I can go to (1,5), (2,6), etc.\n\nNow, back to turn 3 decision.\n\nI think eating the close food (5,3) is good, but let's see if there is risk.\n\nIf I eat (5,3) on turn 3, snake length 2.\n\nThen I can go for (4,1).\n\nFrom (5,3), move D to (5,2) on turn 4.\n\nThen from (5,2), move L to (4,2) on turn 5.\n\nThen from (4,2), move D to (4,1) to eat food on turn 6.\n\nThen snake grows to length 3.\n\nPositions: after eating (4,1) on turn 6, head at (4,1), body at (4,2) and tail at (5,2)? Let's trace.\n\nTurn 3: move D to (5,3), eat, snake: [(5,3), (5,4)]\n\nTurn 4: move D to (5,2), no food, snake: [(5,2), (5,3)]  (head at (5,2), tail at (5,3))\n\nTurn 5: move L to (4,2), no food, snake: [(4,2), (5,2)]  (head at (4,2), tail at (5,2))\n\nTurn 6: move D to (4,1), eat food, grow, snake: [(4,1), (4,2), (5,2)]  head at (4,1), body (4,2), tail (5,2)\n\nThen from there, I can go to other food.\n\nBut (4,1) is bottom, so I can move L to (3,1), but (3,1) is obstacle, so not possible.\n\nMove R to (5,1), or U to (4,2), but (4,2) is body, so moving U to (4,2) is possible, since it's the body segment, but when I move, tail moves away.\n\nFrom (4,1), with direction D (since I moved down to it), so current direction D.\n\nThen possible moves: L, R, U (but U is opposite to D, so not allowed? Current direction D, moving U is up, opposite, not allowed.\n\nSo only L or R, but L to (3,1) obstacle, not possible.\n\nR to (5,1).\n\n(5,1) is free, no obstacle.\n\nSo move R to (5,1) on turn 7.\n\nThen from (5,1), I can move U to (5,2), but (5,2) is tail, or R to (6,1), or L to (4,1) but that's body.\n\nBut (5,2) is tail, moving to it is safe.\n\nAfter moving to (5,1), snake is [(5,1), (4,1), (4,2)] or something.\n\nAfter turn 6: snake [(4,1), (4,2), (5,2)]\n\nTurn 7: move R to (5,1), no food, so snake moves: head to (5,1), then body segments: the first body segment moves to where head was, (4,1), and the tail moves to where the first body was, (4,2)? Positions: let's list.\n\nAt turn 6 end: positions: head (4,1), segment 1: (4,2), segment 2: (5,2)  (tail)\n\nOn turn 7, move head to (5,1). Then new positions: head (5,1), segment 1 moves to previous head position (4,1), segment 2 (tail) moves to previous segment 1 position (4,2).\n\nSo snake: [(5,1), (4,1), (4,2)]\n\nNow, from (5,1), current direction R? I moved R from (4,1) to (5,1), so direction R.\n\nPossible moves: U to (5,2), D not possible (y=1), L to (4,1) which is body, not tail, or R to (6,1).\n\nU to (5,2): (5,2) is currently occupied by the tail at (4,2)? Positions: head (5,1), body (4,1), tail (4,2). (5,2) is free? Not occupied.\n\n(5,2) was occupied by tail at turn 6, but after move, tail is at (4,2), so (5,2) is empty.\n\nMoving U to (5,2) is free.\n\nSimilarly, R to (6,1).\n\nL to (4,1) is body, not tail, so if I move there, collision.\n\n(4,1) is the position of the first body segment, not tail. If head moves to (4,1), which is occupied by body, it collides.\n\nSo cannot move L to (4,1).\n\nOnly U or R.\n\nU to (5,2) or R to (6,1).\n\n(5,2) has no food, (6,1) no food.\n\nThen I can go up to find other food.\n\nBut there is food at (1,6) and (1,2), but (1,2) is far, and I am at (5,1).\n\nTo reach (1,2), I need to go left, but from (5,1), move L to (4,1) not possible, so I have to go U or R first.\n\nSay move U to (5,2) on turn 8.\n\nThen from (5,2), I can move to (4,2), (5,3), etc.\n\nBut (4,2) is occupied by tail? At turn 7 end: positions [(5,1), (4,1), (4,2)]\n\nTurn 8 move U to (5,2): head to (5,2), segment 1 to (5,1), segment 2 to (4,1), so snake [(5,2), (5,1), (4,1)]\n\nThen from (5,2), I can move U to (5,3), L to (4,2), R to (6,2), etc.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBut I have food at (1,6) and (1,2) to eat.\n\n(1,2) might be difficult to reach because of obstacles at (2,2) and (3,1), (3,2).\n\nFor example, from left side, (1,1), (1,2), (1,3) are accessible, but to get there, I need to go around.\n\nFrom (4,1) or (5,1), I can only go right or up, not left directly because of obstacles.\n\nThe only way to left is through top or bottom, but bottom is blocked.\n\nFor instance, I can go up to y=3 or higher, then left.\n\nBut let's see if I can reach (1,2).\n\nFrom (1,2), adjacent: (1,1), (1,3), (2,1)\n\n(2,1) is free, as no obstacle.\n\n(2,1) adjacent to (1,1), (2,2) obstacle, (3,1) obstacle, (2,3)? (2,3) free.\n\nSo from (2,1), I can only go to (1,1) or (2,3) or (1,2), etc.\n\nBut to enter the area, from right, I can come to (3,3) or something, but (3,2) and (3,1) obstacles, so from (3,3) I can go to (2,3), then to (2,1) or (1,3), etc.\n\nSimilarly, for (1,6), top left, with obstacle at (3,6), so I can come from (2,6) or (1,5), etc.\n\n(4,5) obstacle, so middle top blocked.\n\nNow, back to turn 3, if I don't eat (5,3), but go right to (6,4).\n\nTurn 3: move R to (6,4)\n\nSnake still length 1 at (6,4), direction R.\n\nTurn 4: from (6,4), move D to (6,3)  (since U to (6,5) or L to (5,4), but (5,3) food below, so move D to (6,3))\n\nThen at (6,3), no food.\n\nTurn 5: move L to (5,3) to eat food. Now (5,3) life span: at turn 3 L=7, not eaten turn 3, so after turn 3 L=6, not eaten turn 4, after turn 4 L=5, on turn 5 I eat it, so still there.\n\nEat on turn 5, snake grows to length 2: [(5,3), (6,3)]  (head at (5,3), tail at (6,3))\n\nDirection L (since moved left).\n\nThen I can go for (4,1).\n\nFrom (5,3), move L to (4,3) on turn 6.\n\n(4,3) no food.\n\nThen move D to (4,2) on turn 7.\n\nThen move D to (4,1) on turn 8 to eat.\n\nCompared to previous, I ate (5,3) on turn 5 instead of turn 3, and (4,1) on turn 8 instead of turn 6, so delayed.\n\nAnd snake is shorter for longer.\n\nSo better to eat (5,3) early.\n\nMoreover, (5,3) might be eaten by someone else, but no other snakes, so only me.\n\nSo I think eating (5,3) on turn 3 is better.\n\nBut is there a reason not to? For example, if it causes trap, but with short snake, no issue.\n\nAnother food is (1,6), which is top left, and (1,2) bottom left.\n\n(1,2) has longer life span 8, so I can eat it later.\n\nBut to reach (1,6), from current position, I can go up and left.\n\nFor example, from (5,4), on turn 3, instead of down, move U to (5,5).\n\nThen at (5,5), no food.\n\nThen I can go left to (4,5), but (4,5) is obstacle! Internal obstacle (4,5), so I cannot go to (4,5).\n\nFrom (5,5), possible moves: U to (5,6), D to (5,4), L to (4,5) obstacle, not possible, R to (6,5).\n\nBut (6,5) is free, or U to (5,6), or D to (5,4) which is previous.\n\nCurrent direction after moving U to (5,5) is U.\n\nThen turn 4, from (5,5), I can move U to (5,6), D to (5,4), or R to (6,5), not L (obstacle).\n\nIf move U to (5,6), then at (5,6), but (3,6) is obstacle, but (5,6) is free.\n\nThen from there, I can go left to (4,6), but (4,6) free? Obstacles: (3,6), (4,5), but (4,6) not listed, so free.\n\n(3,6) obstacle, (4,5) obstacle, so (4,6) is free.\n\nThen to (3,6) not possible, so to (2,6) via other path.\n\nBut food at (1,6), so I need to go to (1,6).\n\nFrom (5,6), move L to (4,6) on turn 5.\n\nThen from (4,6), move L to (3,6)? (3,6) obstacle, not possible.\n\nFrom (4,6), I can move D to (4,5), but (4,5) obstacle, not possible.\n\nU to (4,7) wall, not possible.\n\nSo only D or L or R, but R to (5,6) previous, L to (3,6) obstacle, D to (4,5) obstacle.\n\n(4,6) adjacent cells: (4,5) down, obstacle; (4,7) up, wall; (3,6) left, obstacle; (5,6) right; (4,6) itself.\n\nSo only possible moves: to (5,6) or, y adjacent: (4,5) down, obstacle; (4,7) wall; x adjacent: (3,6) left, obstacle; (5,6) right.\n\nSo only to (5,6), which is back.\n\nSo (4,6) is a dead end if I go there, because only way in and out is through (5,6).\n\nSimilarly, from (5,6), I can only go to (5,5) or (4,6) or (6,6), but (4,6) is dead end.\n\n(5,6) to (6,6) is possible.\n\n(6,6) is corner.\n\nBut to reach (1,6), I need to go through (2,6) or (1,5).\n\nBut from (5,6), I can move to (6,6), then down to (6,5), etc., but not directly left because of obstacles.\n\nThe area around (3,6) and (4,5) blocked.\n\nSo to reach (1,6), I should go via the bottom or middle, but bottom has obstacles too.\n\nFor example, from (5,4), move L to (4,4), but on turn 3, I cannot move L because current direction R, moving L is not opposite, opposite is L for R? Current direction R, opposite is L, so I cannot move L on next turn.\n\nOn turn 3, from (5,4) dir R, I can move U, D, R, not L.\n\nSo I cannot go left directly.\n\nSo only U, D, R.\n\nR to (6,4), U to (5,5), or D to (5,3).\n\nU to (5,5) might lead to dead end as above.\n\nSo probably not good.\n\nD to (5,3) is best.\n\nThen after eating, I can go for (4,1) as before.\n\nBut (4,1) is close.\n\nThen after that, I can go for (1,2) or (1,6).\n\nBut (1,2) might be harder to reach.\n\nSince (1,2) has life span 8, I can eat it later.\n\nSimilarly, (1,6) life span 7.\n\nBut let's see if I can plan to eat both.\n\nFirst, eat (5,3) on turn 3.\n\nThen snake length 2 at (5,3) and (5,4).\n\nTurn 4: move D to (5,2)  (to go towards (4,1))\n\nTurn 5: move L to (4,2)\n\nTurn 6: move D to (4,1) eat food, snake length 3.\n\nNow at (4,1) with body.\n\nAs before, only can move R to (5,1) on turn 7.\n\nTurn 7: move R to (5,1)\n\nNow at (5,1), direction R.\n\nCan move U to (5,2) or R to (6,1).\n\n(5,2) is free, (6,1) free.\n\nNow, to reach other food, I need to go up.\n\nSay move U to (5,2) on turn 8.\n\nThen at (5,2), can move U to (5,3), L to (4,2), R to (6,2), etc.\n\n(5,3) might have been eaten, but it's gone.\n\nFood left: (1,6) and (1,2).\n\n(1,6) at top left, (1,2) bottom left.\n\nFrom (5,2), I can go left to (4,2), but (4,2) is part of body? At turn 8, after move.\n\nTurn 7 end: positions after eating (4,1) on turn 6: [(4,1), (4,2), (5,2)]? Earlier:\n\nTurn 6: after eating (4,1), snake [(4,1), (4,2), (5,2)] head (4,1), body (4,2), tail (5,2)\n\nTurn 7: move R to (5,1), so head to (5,1), segment1 to (4,1), segment2 to (4,2), so snake [(5,1), (4,1), (4,2)]\n\nTurn 8: move U to (5,2), head to (5,2), segment1 to (5,1), segment2 to (4,1), so snake [(5,2), (5,1), (4,1)]\n\nNow at (5,2), direction U (since moved up).\n\nCan move U to (5,3), D to (5,1) but (5,1) is body, not tail, collision if move there, L to (4,2), R to (6,2).\n\n(4,2) is free? Not occupied, but (4,2) was tail position before, but now empty.\n\nPositions: head (5,2), body (5,1), tail (4,1), so (4,2) free.\n\nMove L to (4,2) or U to (5,3) or R to (6,2).\n\n(5,3) has no food, but I can go there.\n\nTo reach (1,2), I need to go left and down, but down is bottom, and obstacles.\n\nFrom here, I can move to (4,2) on turn 9.\n\nTurn 9: move L to (4,2)\n\nThen at (4,2), direction L.\n\nCan move U to (4,3), D to (4,1) but (4,1) is body? Positions: after move to (4,2), head (4,2), segment1 to (5,2), segment2 to (5,1)? Turn 8 end: [(5,2), (5,1), (4,1)]\n\nTurn 9 move L to (4,2): head to (4,2), segment1 to (5,2), segment2 to (5,1), so snake [(4,2), (5,2), (5,1)]\n\nNow at (4,2), direction L.\n\nPossible moves: U to (4,3), D to (4,1), L to (3,2) but (3,2) obstacle, not possible, R to (5,2) body.\n\nD to (4,1): (4,1) is occupied by tail? Tail is at (5,1), so (4,1) is free.\n\n(4,1) was occupied earlier, but now empty.\n\nMove D to (4,1) or U to (4,3).\n\nBut (4,1) has no food, and it's bottom.\n\nMove U to (4,3) on turn 10.\n\nThen at (4,3), can move to (3,3), (4,4), (5,3), etc.\n\nBut to reach (1,2), I need to go to (3,3), then (2,3), then (2,1) or (1,3), but (2,2) obstacle, so (2,1) to (1,1) to (1,2), for example.\n\nSimilarly for (1,6).\n\nBut this is taking many turns, and food might disappear.\n\n(1,6) life span 7 at turn 3, so disappears after turn 9 if not eaten.\n\nTurn 3 L=7, after turn 3 L=6, ..., after turn 9 L=0, disappear before turn 10.\n\nSimilarly, (1,2) L=8, disappears after turn 10.\n\nSo for (1,6), I need to eat by turn 9.\n\nCurrent turn 3.\n\nIf I start from turn 3, eat (5,3) on turn 3, then (4,1) on turn 6, then at turn 7 at (5,1), turn 8 at (5,2), turn 9 at (4,2), turn 10 at (4,3), then to (3,3) etc, but (1,6) would be gone by turn 10.\n\nTo eat (1,6) by turn 9, I need a shorter path.\n\nFrom current position (5,4) on turn 3, if I move U to (5,5), but as before, I can go to (5,6) or (6,5), but to reach (1,6) quickly.\n\nFrom (5,5), move U to (5,6) on turn 4.\n\nThen at (5,6), move L to (4,6) on turn 5? But (4,6) is dead end, as I thought earlier.\n\nFrom (5,6), move to (6,6) on turn 5.\n\nThen from (6,6), move D to (6,5) on turn 6.\n\n(6,5) is free? Obstacles: (4,5) is obstacle, but (6,5) not, so free.\n\nThen from (6,5), I can move D to (6,4), L to (5,5), etc.\n\nBut not closer to (1,6).\n\nTo go left, I need to go down to lower y, but obstacles block.\n\nThe only way to left is through y=3 or 4.\n\nFor example, from (5,4), move D to (5,3) on turn 3, but that's down.\n\nOr move R to (6,4), then D to (6,3), then L to (5,3), but same as before.\n\nPerhaps I should ignore (1,6) and focus on (1,2) or other, but (1,2) has longer life.\n\nBut let's check if (1,6) is reachable in time.\n\nShortest path from (5,4) to (1,6): need to go left 4 steps, up 2 steps, but with obstacles, not direct.\n\nFor example, path: (5,4) to (4,4) but cannot move L on turn 3.\n\nFrom (5,4), move U to (5,5) turn 3.\n\nThen turn 4 move U to (5,6).\n\nThen turn 5 move L to (4,6)? But (4,6) dead end.\n\nFrom (5,6), move to (6,6) turn 5.\n\nThen turn 6 move D to (6,5).\n\nThen turn 7 move D to (6,4).\n\nThen turn 8 move L to (5,4), but that's back.\n\nNot progress.\n\nFrom (6,5), move L to (5,5) turn 7.\n\nThen from (5,5), move D to (5,4) turn 8.\n\nWorse.\n\nTo go left, from (5,4) on turn 3, move D to (5,3) to eat, then go left from there.\n\nBut (5,3) is at y=3, then I can go to (4,3), (3,3), etc.\n\nBut (3,2) and (3,1) obstacles, so from (3,3) I can go to (2,3), then to (2,4) or (2,1), etc.\n\nThen to (1,2) or (1,6).\n\nBut for (1,6), from (2,3) to (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), then (1,6).\n\n(2,6) free, (2,5) free, etc.\n\nBut from current, it will take many turns.\n\nTurn 3: move D to (5,3) eat\n\nTurn 4: move L to (4,3)  (assume we don't go down for now)\n\nAt (4,3), no food.\n\nTurn 5: move L to (3,3)\n\n(3,3) free.\n\nTurn 6: move U to (3,4) or something, but to go to (1,6), need to go up.\n\nFrom (3,3), move U to (3,4) turn 6.\n\nTurn 7: move U to (3,5)  ( (3,5) free? Obstacles: (4,5) obstacle, but (3,5) not, so free)\n\nTurn 8: move U to (3,6) but (3,6) obstacle, not possible.\n\nFrom (3,5), can move L to (2,5), U to (3,6) not, D to (3,4), R to (4,5) obstacle.\n\nSo move L to (2,5) turn 8.\n\nThen at (2,5), move U to (2,6) turn 9.\n\nThen at (2,6), move L to (1,6) eat on turn 10.\n\nBut (1,6) life span: at turn 3 L=7, after turn 9 L=7-6=1? After turn 3: L=6, turn4:5, turn5:4, turn6:3, turn7:2, turn8:1, turn9: after turn 9, L=0, disappears before turn 10.\n\nSo on turn 10, (1,6) is gone, so I cannot eat it.\n\nSimilarly, if I start earlier, but with the path, I arrive on turn 10, too late.\n\nIf I go directly from (5,4) to (1,6) via different path, but with obstacles and no direct left move, it's hard to reach in 6 turns.\n\nFor example, minimum Manhattan distance |5-1| + |4-6| =4+2=6, but with obstacles, longer, and I have to move around, so at least 6 or 7 turns, but by turn 9 it disappears, so I can only eat if I start immediately and have short path.\n\nBut from turn 3, with the need to go left but cannot on turn 3, it's difficult.\n\nPerhaps (1,6) is not reachable in time, so I should not bother with it.\n\nSimilarly, (1,2) has life span 8, so disappears after turn 10.\n\nTurn 3 L=8, after turn 10 L=0, disappear before turn 11.\n\nSo I can eat by turn 10.\n\nFor example, from current, after eating nearby food, I can go to (1,2).\n\nBut let's first eat the close food.\n\nOn turn 3, move D to (5,3) to eat.\n\nThen for turn 4, instead of going down to (4,1), I can go left immediately to reach left side faster.\n\nFrom (5,3), turn 4 move L to (4,3)\n\nTurn 5 move L to (3,3)\n\nTurn 6 move D to (3,2) but (3,2) obstacle, not possible.\n\nFrom (3,3), move D to (3,2) not possible, move U to (3,4), or L to (2,3), etc.\n\nMove L to (2,3) turn 6.\n\nThen to (2,2) but (2,2) obstacle, not possible.\n\nMove to (2,1) or (1,3).\n\nSay move to (2,1) on turn 7: from (2,3) move D to (2,2) not possible, so move to (2,4)? (2,3) to (2,4) U, or (1,3) L, or (3,3) R, or (2,2) D not.\n\nSo move L to (1,3) turn 7.\n\nThen at (1,3), can move to (1,2) or (1,4), etc.\n\nMove D to (1,2) on turn 8 to eat.\n\n(1,2) L=8 at turn 3, after turn 8 L=8-5=3, still there.\n\nEat on turn 8.\n\nSimilarly, I can do that.\n\nBut I have to eat (5,3) first.\n\nSo sequence:\n\nTurn 3: move D to (5,3) eat\n\nTurn 4: move L to (4,3)\n\nTurn 5: move L to (3,3)\n\nTurn 6: move L to (2,3)  (since (3,3) to (2,3) left)\n\nTurn 7: move L to (1,3)  ( (2,3) to (1,3) left)\n\nTurn 8: move D to (1,2) eat\n\nThen snake has grown.\n\nFrom (1,3) to (1,2) down.\n\nBut (1,2) has food, so eat.\n\nNow, what about the other food? (4,1) is still there, but I didn't eat it.\n\n(4,1) life span 7, at turn 3, after turn 8 L=7-5=2, still there, but I am at (1,2), far.\n\nI could eat (4,1) first.\n\nBut (4,1) is closer to start.\n\nOn turn 3, move D to (5,3) eat\n\nTurn 4: move D to (5,2)\n\nTurn 5: move L to (4,2)\n\nTurn 6: move D to (4,1) eat\n\nThen from (4,1), move R to (5,1) turn 7\n\nThen move U to (5,2) turn 8\n\nThen move U to (5,3) turn 9, but no food, etc.\n\nThen to go to (1,2), it will take more turns.\n\nFor example, from (5,2) turn 8, move L to (4,2) turn 9, but (4,2) might be occupied or not.\n\nEarlier sequence after eating (4,1): turn 6 at (4,1), turn 7 to (5,1), turn 8 to (5,2), then from (5,2) turn 9 to (4,2), turn 10 to (3,2) obstacle not, so to (3,3) or (4,3), etc, to reach (1,2) by turn 10 or 11, but (1,2) disappears after turn 10, so if I eat on turn 11, it might be gone.\n\n(1,2) L=8 at turn 3, after turn 10 L=0, gone before turn 11.\n\nSo to eat by turn 10.\n\nIf I go directly to (1,2) after eating (5,3), I can eat on turn 8 as above.\n\nThen I have time for (1,6), but (1,6) disappears earlier.\n\n(1,6) L=7, gone after turn 9, so I cannot eat it if I go to (1,2) first.\n\nSimilarly, if I go to (1,6) first, but I may not reach in time.\n\nSo perhaps I should give up on (1,6) and focus on (1,2) and (4,1).\n\nBut (4,1) is easy to eat early.\n\nLet's eat both (5,3) and (4,1) quickly, then go to (1,2).\n\nTurn 3: move D to (5,3) eat  // score +1, length 2\n\nTurn 4: move D to (5,2)     // no food\n\nTurn 5: move L to (4,2)     // no food\n\nTurn 6: move D to (4,1) eat  // score +2, length 3\n\nNow at (4,1), turn 6.\n\nTurn 7: move R to (5,1)    // no food, as only choice\n\nTurn 8: move U to (5,2)    // no food\n\nNow at (5,2), direction U.\n\nCan move U to (5,3), L to (4,2), R to (6,2)\n\nTo go to (1,2), I need to go left.\n\nMove L to (4,2) on turn 9.\n\nAt (4,2), direction L.\n\nCan move U to (4,3), D to (4,1) body? Positions: turn 8 end: after turn 8 move U to (5,2), snake: head (5,2), segment1 (5,1), segment2 (4,1)\n\nTurn 9 move L to (4,2): head to (4,2), segment1 to (5,2), segment2 to (5,1), so snake [(4,2), (5,2), (5,1)]\n\nAt (4,2), direction L.\n\nMoves: U to (4,3), D to (4,1), L to (3,2) obstacle not, R to (5,2) body.\n\nD to (4,1): (4,1) is free? Tail is at (5,1), so (4,1) free, move D to (4,1).\n\nBut no food.\n\nOr U to (4,3).\n\nMove U to (4,3) on turn 10.\n\nThen at (4,3), can move to (3,3), (4,4), etc.\n\nBut to reach (1,2), I need to go to (3,3), then (2,3), then (2,1) or (1,3), then (1,2).\n\nFrom (4,3) turn 10, move L to (3,3) turn 11.\n\nThen move L to (2,3) turn 12.\n\nThen move D to (2,2) not possible, obstacle, so move to (2,1) or (1,3).\n\nSay move to (1,3) turn 13.\n\nThen to (1,2) turn 14.\n\nBut (1,2) disappeared after turn 10, so gone.\n\nNot possible.\n\nFrom (2,3), move D to (2,1) if possible, but from (2,3) to (2,1) not adjacent, need to go through (2,2) which is obstacle, so not directly.\n\nMust go to (1,3) or (2,4), then to (1,2) via (1,3) or (2,1).\n\n(2,1) is at (2,1), then to (1,1) or (1,2).\n\nSo from (2,3) to (2,1): not possible directly, so move to (1,3) first or to (3,3), etc.\n\nBut (1,2) is only adjacent to (1,1), (1,3), (2,2) obstacle, so only from (1,1) or (1,3).\n\nSo I must go to (1,3) or (1,1) first.\n\nFrom (2,3), I can move L to (1,3) in one step.\n\nThen from (1,3) to (1,2) down.\n\nSo on turn 12 at (2,3), move L to (1,3) turn 13.\n\nTurn 14 move D to (1,2) but (1,2) gone.\n\nSo I cannot eat (1,2) if I eat both (5,3) and (4,1).\n\nTherefore, to eat (1,2), I should go directly after eating (5,3) and skip (4,1).\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 3: move D to (5,3) eat\n\nTurn 4: move L to (4,3)\n\nTurn 5: move L to (3,3)\n\nTurn 6: move L to (2,3)\n\nTurn 7: move L to (1,3)\n\nTurn 8: move D to (1,2) eat\n\nThen I have eaten two food, score 2, length 3.\n\nThen from (1,2), I can go to other places, but (4,1) might still be there or not.\n\n(4,1) L=7, at turn 3, after turn 8 L=7-5=2, so on turn 9, I can try to eat it, but I am at (1,2), far away.\n\nFrom (1,2), move U to (1,3) turn 9, then to (1,4), etc., but to (4,1) is far, and life span short, probably not reachable.\n\nSimilarly, (1,6) gone.\n\nSo I miss (4,1).\n\nBut (4,1) is one point, same as others.\n\nWith the direct path to (1,2), I eat two food: (5,3) and (1,2).\n\nIf I eat (5,3) and (4,1), I also eat two, but miss (1,2).\n\nIn both cases, I eat two, but in the first case, I have time for (1,2), in second, I eat (4,1) but not (1,2).\n\nBut (1,2) has the same value.\n\nPerhaps I can eat (5,3) and then (4,1), and forget about (1,2) since it's hard to reach.\n\nBut (1,2) is reachable if I go directly.\n\nAnd with life span 8, I have time.\n\nIn the sequence above, I eat (5,3) on turn 3 and (1,2) on turn 8.\n\nI could eat (4,1) on turn 6 if I go down, but then not to (1,2).\n\nSince all food same value, I can choose.\n\nBut there is also the food at (1,6), but I can't reach it in time, so ignore.\n\nSo for now, on turn 3, move D to (5,3) to eat.\n\nThen for turn 4, move L to (4,3) to head towards (1,2).\n\nThen continue.\n\nBut I need to output multiple turns.\n\nThe answer should be a sequence of actions for the next few turns.\n\nSince I think 5+ turns ahead, I can output 5 turns or more.\n\nCurrent turn 3.\n\nAction for turn 3: move D to eat (5,3).\n\nThen turn 4: move L to (4,3)\n\nTurn 5: move L to (3,3)\n\nTurn 6: move L to (2,3)\n\nTurn 7: move L to (1,3)\n\nTurn 8: move D to (1,2) eat\n\nBut turn 8 is t1+5, t1=3, so up to turn 8.\n\nBut I can output from turn 3 to turn 7 or 8.\n\nThe format says \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" so I need to specify for each turn.\n\nBut the state might change, but since no randomness, I can plan.\n\nAlso, for the moves, I need to ensure no collision.\n\nIn the sequence to (1,2), all moves should be safe since snake is short.\n\nAt turn 3, after move D, snake length 2.\n\nMoving to (4,3), (3,3), etc., all free cells.\n\nNo problem.\n\nI could consider the tail reward danger, but no food under body yet.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nBut on turn 8, move D to (1,2), and if the tail is adjacent, but with length 3 or 4, it might not be.\n\nIn this case, when I move to (1,2), the tail is far, so no issue.\n\nSo for output, I can do:\n\nTurn 3: D\n\nTurn 4: L\n\nTurn 5: L\n\nTurn 6: L\n\nTurn 7: L\n\nThen on turn 7 I am at (1,3), and move D on turn 8, but I don't need to output turn 8 if I stop at turn 7.\n\nt1=3, so turns 3,4,5,6,7 for 5 turns.\n\nOr more.\n\nBut let's see the grid has other food, but I think this is a plan.\n\nPerhaps on turn 4, from (5,3), I can move directly to (4,3), but with direction, after move D to (5,3), direction D, so moving L to (4,3) is allowed, not opposite.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nSo I think this works.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while ensuring long-term survival, the AI must prioritize eating accessible positive food and avoid risks such as collisions with walls, obstacles, or the snake's body. Given the current state at turn \\(t_1 = 3\\):\n- Snake is at [(5,4)] (length 1, head only), moving right (R).\n- Food available: (5,3) value 1, life span 7; (4,1) value 1, life span 7; (1,6) value 1, life span 7; (1,2) value 1, life span 8.\n- Internal obstacles: (3,2), (4,5), (3,6), (3,1), (2,2). Border walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, making the playable grid from (1,1) to (6,6).\n\n### Key Considerations for 5+ Turns Ahead:\n1. **Immediate Food Access**: (5,3) is directly below the snake head and can be eaten on turn 3 for +1 score and growth to length 2. This is prioritized as it is low-risk and allows the snake to grow, improving reach for other food.\n2. **Food Life Spans**: \n   - (1,6) disappears after turn 9 (life span 7 at turn 3: after turn 9, life span=0).\n   - (4,1) and (5,3) disappear after turn 9 (life span 7 at turn 3).\n   - (1,2) disappears after turn 10 (life span 8 at turn 3).\n   - (1,6) is too far to reach by turn 9 with obstacles, so it is ignored to focus on reachable food.\n3. **Path to (1,2)**: After eating (5,3), moving left toward (1,2) is optimal. (1,2) has a longer life span (8) and is reachable by turn 8. The path avoids obstacles and dead ends.\n4. **Risks Avoided**: \n   - No instant reverse: Current direction is R, so L is invalid on turn 3. Subsequent moves respect direction constraints.\n   - Collisions: Path avoids walls, obstacles, and body segments. With the snake growing to length 2-3, tail movements are handled safely (moving to tail position is allowed as tail moves away).\n   - No food under body initially, so tail reward danger doesn't apply.\n5. **Obstacle Navigation**: Obstacles block direct paths, especially to the bottom-left (e.g., (2,2) and (3,1) near (1,2)). The chosen path goes via (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3) to (1,2), which is clear.\n6. **Score Maximization**: Eating (5,3) on turn 3 and (1,2) on turn 8 yields +2 score. (4,1) is skipped as it would delay reaching (1,2) and risk its disappearance. (1,6) is unreachable by turn 9.\n\n### Planned Actions (Turns 3 to 7):\n- **Turn 3 (t1)**: Move D (down) to (5,3) to eat positive food. Score +1, snake grows to length 2: positions [(5,3), (5,4)], direction D.\n- **Turn 4 (t1+1)**: Move L (left) to (4,3). No food, snake moves: head (4,3), tail (5,3). Direction L.\n- **Turn 5 (t1+2)**: Move L (left) to (3,3). No food, snake moves: head (3,3), tail (4,3). Direction L.\n- **Turn 6 (t1+3)**: Move L (left) to (2,3). No food, snake moves: head (2,3), tail (3,3). Direction L.\n- **Turn 7 (t1+4)**: Move L (left) to (1,3). No food, snake moves: head (1,3), tail (2,3). Direction L.\n\n### Expected Outcome by Turn 8:\n- **Turn 8**: Move D (down) to (1,2) to eat positive food (life span 8 ensures it remains). Score +2 total, snake grows to length 3: positions [(1,2), (1,3), (2,3)].\n\nThis plan eats two food items safely, with a clear path to (1,2) by turn 8. Beyond turn 7, the snake can navigate to other areas for additional food if available, but the focus up to turn 8 maximizes score within constraints.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 3: D (down)\nTurn 4: L (left)\nTurn 5: L (left)\nTurn 6: L (left)\nTurn 7: L (left)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 4, and the grid has walls and obstacles. The walls are the borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid is from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are deadly, so I can't go there. Also, internal obstacles at (3,2), (4,5), (3,6), (3,1), (2,2). These are like walls; I can't move into them.\n\nSnake positions: head at (5,3), then body at (5,4). So the snake has only two segments: head and one body part, which is also the tail since it's the last segment. Head direction is down, meaning it was moving down to get to (5,3) from (5,4)? Let's see the positions: snake positions are given as [(5,3), (5,4)], so head is first, so at turn 4, head is at (5,3), and the body is at (5,4). Since head direction is D (down), that means from the previous position, it moved down to (5,3). But the previous position was (5,4), and moving down from (5,4) to (5,3) makes sense because y decreases when moving down? I need to clarify the coordinate system.\n\nTypically in grids, (0,0) is bottom-left or top-left? The problem doesn't specify, but since moving up increases y and down decreases y, based on the movement: U (x,y+1), D (x,y-1), L (x-1,y), R (x+1,y). So if U is y+1, that means y increases upwards, so (0,0) is bottom-left, I think. Let's confirm.\n\nU: (x,y+1) — so moving up increases y, so higher y is up.\n\nD: (x,y-1) — down decreases y.\n\nL: (x-1,y) — left decreases x.\n\nR: (x+1,y) — right increases x.\n\nAnd walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7, with (0,0) probably bottom-left or top-left? Since y=0 is a border, and y=7 is another, it doesn't matter as long as consistent.\n\nNow, snake: positions [(5,3), (5,4)] with head direction D (down). Since head is at (5,3) and direction is down, that means it was moving down to get to (5,3). From where? The body is at (5,4), so previous head position was (5,4), and it moved down to (5,3)? But moving down from (5,4) to (5,3) would be decreasing y, so from y=4 to y=3, yes down. But the body is at (5,4), which was the previous head position, I assume.\n\nAt turn 4, head at (5,3), body at (5,4). Since direction is down, the snake moved down in the previous turn.\n\nNow, food positions:\n\n- (4,1) with value 1, life span 6\n\n- (1,6) with value 1, life span 6\n\n- (1,2) with value 1, life span 7\n\n- (2,5) with value 1, life span 10\n\nAll food has value 1, so all positive food? The value is given as 1, and in the description, positive food has value +1, negative has -1, so here all are +1, so all good food. No negative food mentioned.\n\nLife span: for (4,1), life span 6, meaning it disappears after 6 turns, including current turn? \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so at turn 4, life span 6, so it will disappear after turn 4 + 6 - 1? Let's see.\n\nLife span N: disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current.\n\nSo at turn t, if life span is L, it will disappear at the end of turn t + L - 1? For example, if life span is 1 at turn t, it disappears after this turn, so can be eaten only on turn t.\n\nStandard: if life span N at turn t, it has N turns left, including turn t. So after turn t, it has N-1 left, and so on, until turn t + N - 1 is the last turn it can be eaten; after that, it disappears.\n\nSo for (4,1): at turn 4, life span 6, so it can be eaten from turn 4 to turn 9 (since 4 to 9 is 6 turns: turn 4,5,6,7,8,9; disappears after turn 9).\n\nSimilarly:\n\n(4,1): life span 6, disappears after turn 9 (turns 4 to 9)\n\n(1,6): life span 6, disappears after turn 9\n\n(1,2): life span 7, disappears after turn 10 (turns 4 to 10)\n\n(2,5): life span 10, disappears after turn 13 (turns 4 to 13)\n\nAll have value +1.\n\nNow, snake is at [(5,3), (5,4)], head at (5,3), direction down.\n\nPossible moves: since head direction is down, I can move down, left, or right? But no instant reverse, so I cannot move up, because up is opposite to down.\n\nCurrent direction is down, so opposite is up. So I cannot move up next.\n\nAllowed moves: down (same direction), left, or right.\n\nNow, let's see the grid layout.\n\nWalls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So accessible area: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x from 1 to 6? Let's confirm.\n\n\"Border cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7\" — so cells where x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. Similarly, internal obstacles: (3,2), (4,5), (3,6), (3,1), (2,2).\n\nSo let's list all wall cells:\n\n- All cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7\n\n- Plus: (3,2), (4,5), (3,6), (3,1), (2,2)\n\n(3,1) and (3,2) are internal, but y=1 is not border? y=0 and y=7 are borders, so y=1 to y=6 are inside, except where obstacles.\n\nSimilarly, x=1 to x=6 inside.\n\nSo the playable grid is from (1,1) to (6,6), minus obstacles.\n\nNow obstacles: (3,2), (4,5), (3,6), (3,1), (2,2)\n\n(3,1): x=3,y=1\n\n(3,2): x=3,y=2\n\n(2,2): x=2,y=2\n\n(4,5): x=4,y=5\n\n(3,6): x=3,y=6\n\nNow, snake head at (5,3), body at (5,4)\n\nFood at: (4,1), (1,6), (1,2), (2,5)\n\nI need to plan for at least 5 turns ahead.\n\nFirst, current position: head (5,3), possible moves:\n\n- Down: to (5,2)\n\n- Left: to (4,3)\n\n- Right: to (6,3)\n\nCannot go up to (5,4) because body is there, but since the tail will move, I might be able to go there later, but not now because body is there, and moving into body causes collision except for the tail.\n\nRule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nCurrently, body segment is at (5,4), which is the tail, since only one body part.\n\nIf I move up to (5,4), that's where the tail is. Since it's the tail, and I move there, the head moves to (5,4), and the tail will move away, so it should be safe, right?\n\nBut let's see: after I move, the snake grows only if I eat food; otherwise, tail moves.\n\nIf I don't eat food, and I move to a cell, the head moves to new position, tail moves out of its position.\n\nIn this case, if I move to (5,4), which is current tail, then head moves to (5,4), and since no food eaten, tail (which was at (5,4)) moves? The tail was at (5,4), head moves to (5,4), so at new state, head is at (5,4), and since no growth, the tail segment is removed, so only head remains? No.\n\nSnake positions: currently [head: (5,3), tail: (5,4)]\n\nAfter move:\n\n- If I move to a new cell without food, head moves to new position, tail is removed from (5,4), so new snake: head at new position, and the body part that was behind head becomes tail.\n\nCurrently, positions: index 0: head (5,3), index 1: body (5,4)\n\nIf I move to, say, (5,2) down.\n\nThen new head at (5,2), and the body segment moves to where head was, (5,3), so new positions: [(5,2), (5,3)]\n\nSimilarly, if I move left to (4,3), new positions [(4,3), (5,3)]? Head was at (5,3), move to (4,3), so new head (4,3), and body moves to previous head position (5,3).\n\nBut previous head position was (5,3), which is now empty? Let's think.\n\nStandard snake movement: when snake moves, head goes to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n\nSo from [A, B] where A=head, B=tail.\n\nAfter move to new cell C:\n\n- New head at C\n\n- The segment that was at B moves to A, but since only two segments, new tail is at A.\n\nPositions: before move: segment 0: (5,3), segment 1: (5,4)\n\nAfter moving head to new position, say C.\n\nThen segment 0 moves to C, segment 1 moves to where segment 0 was, so to (5,3).\n\nSo new positions: [C, (5,3)]\n\nIf C is (5,2) down: new snake [(5,2), (5,3)]\n\nIf C is (4,3) left: new snake [(4,3), (5,3)]\n\nIf C is (6,3) right: new snake [(6,3), (5,3)]\n\nIf I move up to (5,4), which is current position of segment 1.\n\nC = (5,4)\n\nThen new head at (5,4), and segment 1 moves to where segment 0 was, which is (5,3).\n\nSo new positions: [(5,4), (5,3)]\n\nNow, is this safe? The head moves to (5,4), which was previously occupied by tail, but tail moves to (5,3), so no collision.\n\nMoreover, if there was food at (5,4), I would eat it, but in this case, no food there.\n\nCurrently, no food at (5,4), so moving up is possible and safe.\n\nBut current head direction is down, and moving up is reverse, which is not allowed? \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\"\n\nCurrent direction is down, so I cannot move up, because up is opposite.\n\nYes, so moving up is not allowed this turn.\n\nTherefore, possible moves from (5,3): down to (5,2), left to (4,3), right to (6,3).\n\nNow, check if these cells are safe.\n\nFirst, (5,2): is it wall or body?\n\nWalls: borders y=0 or y=7, but y=2, x=5, not border. Internal obstacles: (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), etc., (5,2) is not in obstacles. So free cell? But snake body: body is at (5,4), not at (5,2). So (5,2) should be free.\n\nSimilarly, (4,3): x=4,y=3, not border, not in obstacles: obstacles are (3,1),(3,2),(4,5),(3,6),(3,1) duplicate? (3,1) listed once, but (4,3) not there. So free.\n\n(6,3): x=6,y=3, x=6 is not wall? Borders x=0 and x=7, so x=6 is not border, y=3 not border, not in internal obstacles, so free.\n\nNow, food: no food at these cells, so no eating.\n\nI need to think ahead.\n\nFirst, let's sketch the grid.\n\nGrid from (1,1) to (6,6) playable, minus obstacles.\n\nList all obstacles:\n\n- (2,2), (3,1), (3,2), (3,6), (4,5)\n\nAlso, borders are walls, but since we can't go there, we can consider the playable area.\n\nBut for collision, we need to check coordinates.\n\nNow, food at:\n\n- (4,1): but (4,1) is x=4,y=1. Is (4,1) an obstacle? Internal obstacles include (3,1), but not (4,1). (3,1) is obstacle, (4,1) is not listed, so should be free, but food is there.\n\nSimilarly, (1,6), (1,2), (2,5)\n\n(1,2): x=1,y=2, not obstacle.\n\n(2,5): x=2,y=5, not obstacle.\n\n(1,6): x=1,y=6, not obstacle.\n\nNow, snake head at (5,3).\n\nGoal is to eat food while avoiding risks, think 5+ turns ahead.\n\nSince all food is +1, and snake is small, only 2 segments, so eating food is good to grow.\n\nBut need to avoid dead ends or traps.\n\nAlso, \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nCurrently, tail is at (5,4), head at (5,3), so adjacent vertically.\n\nBut no food at tail, so no issue now.\n\nNow, plan moves.\n\nFirst, possible actions at turn 4: D (down to (5,2)), L (left to (4,3)), R (right to (6,3))\n\nI need to simulate each option for at least 5 turns.\n\nStart with moving down to (5,2) at turn 4.\n\nTurn 4: move D to (5,2)\n\nNew snake positions: head to (5,2), tail to previous head (5,3), so [(5,2), (5,3)]\n\nNo food eaten, so length same.\n\nHead direction now down? Since moved down.\n\nNow, at turn 5, from (5,2), possible moves.\n\nCurrent direction down, so can move D, L, R.\n\n- D to (5,1): y=1, not border? y=0 is wall, y=1 is not, but is it obstacle? Obstacles: (3,1) is obstacle, but (5,1) not listed, so should be free. Food? No food at (5,1).\n\n- L to (4,2): x=4,y=2, free? Not obstacle. Food? No.\n\n- R to (6,2): x=6,y=2, free, no food.\n\nAlso, cannot move up to (5,3) because body is there now? At turn 5, body is at (5,3), so moving to (5,3) would be body collision, except if tail, but tail is at (5,3), and head moving to it.\n\nBut (5,3) is current tail position.\n\nIf move to (5,3), head to (5,3), tail moves to where? New head at (5,3), tail moves to previous head position (5,2)? Let's see.\n\nCurrent positions: head (5,2), tail (5,3)\n\nMove to C:\n\nIf C is (5,3), new head at (5,3), tail moves to where head was, (5,2). So new positions [(5,3), (5,2)]\n\nNo collision, since tail moved.\n\nBut in this case, no food, so ok.\n\nBut current direction is down, moving up to (5,3) is reverse? From (5,2) to (5,3) is up, which is opposite to current down, so cannot move up because of no instant reverse.\n\nSo at turn 5, from (5,2) with direction down, cannot move up to (5,3).\n\nPossible: D to (5,1), L to (4,2), R to (6,2)\n\nAll safe.\n\nSay I go down to (5,1) at turn 5.\n\nThen new snake: head (5,1), body (5,2)\n\nDirection down.\n\nNow turn 6, from (5,1), possible moves.\n\nCurrent direction down, so D, L, R.\n\nD to (5,0): but y=0 is wall, collision, death.\n\nCannot.\n\nL to (4,1): (4,1) has food! Food at (4,1) with value 1, life span 6 at turn 4, so at turn 6, it still exists? Life span 6 from turn 4, so available until turn 9.\n\n(4,1) is free? Not obstacle, and has food.\n\nR to (6,1): x=6,y=1, free, no food.\n\nAlso, cannot move up to (5,2) because reverse not allowed, and body is there.\n\nSo possible: L to (4,1) or R to (6,1). D to (5,0) invalid.\n\nIf I move L to (4,1), I eat the food there.\n\nNew head at (4,1), and since food eaten, snake grows, so tail does not move. New positions: head at (4,1), body segments remain, so from [ (5,1), (5,2) ] move head to (4,1), eat food, so new snake: head (4,1), then previous head (5,1) becomes body, and tail (5,2) remains, so [(4,1), (5,1), (5,2)]\n\nLength increases to 3.\n\nHead direction now left.\n\nIf I move R to (6,1), no food, new snake [(6,1), (5,1)], no growth.\n\nBut (6,1) is near border, x=6, y=1.\n\nBack to turn 4 choice.\n\nSimilarly, other moves.\n\nI need to think which food to target.\n\nFood locations: (4,1) is at bottom, (1,6) top-left, (1,2) bottom-left, (2,5) middle-left.\n\nSnake at (5,3), which is right-middle.\n\nAlso, obstacles at (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), etc., which block access to some areas.\n\nFor example, to reach (4,1), from (5,3), I can go down to (5,2), then left to (4,2)? (4,2) is free, then to (4,1), but (4,2) to (4,1) is down.\n\n(4,2) is free? Let's list free cells.\n\nMake a grid mentally.\n\nRows y=1 to y=6, columns x=1 to x=6.\n\nBut y=1 is bottom, y=6 top? Since U increases y, D decreases y, so y=1 bottom, y=6 top.\n\nSimilarly x=1 left, x=6 right.\n\nWalls: all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, not playable.\n\nInternal obstacles: (2,2), (3,1), (3,2), (3,6), (4,5)\n\n(3,1): x=3,y=1\n\n(3,2): x=3,y=2\n\n(2,2): x=2,y=2\n\n(4,5): x=4,y=5\n\n(3,6): x=3,y=6\n\nNow, food:\n\n(4,1): x=4,y=1\n\n(1,6): x=1,y=6\n\n(1,2): x=1,y=2\n\n(2,5): x=2,y=5\n\nSnake head: (5,3)\n\nFrom (5,3), moving down to (5,2) brings me closer to (4,1).\n\nMoving left to (4,3) is closer to center or to (2,5)? (2,5) is at left.\n\nMoving right to (6,3) is to the right edge.\n\nBut at (6,3), I can go up or down, but not left because of direction? Not necessarily.\n\nBut let's consider the risks.\n\nAlso, the tail reward danger: but currently no issue.\n\nSince I need to think 5+ turns ahead, I should consider paths to food and avoid areas where I might get trapped.\n\nFor example, the bottom-left has obstacles: (3,1) and (3,2) are obstacles, so to reach (4,1), I can go via (4,2) or (5,1), etc.\n\n(4,2) is free, (5,1) is free.\n\nSimilarly, (1,2) is at bottom-left, but there is (2,2) obstacle, so to reach (1,2), I need to go through (1,1) or (1,3), but (1,1): x=1,y=1, not border? x=1 is not wall, y=1 not wall, so (1,1) is playable? Borders are x=0 and x=7, so x=1 to 6 are ok, similarly y=1 to 6.\n\n(1,1) should be free, no obstacle listed.\n\nSimilarly, (1,2) has food.\n\nBut to reach (1,2), from (1,1) or (1,3) or (2,2), but (2,2) is obstacle, so only (1,1) or (1,3).\n\n(1,3) is free.\n\nSimilarly, (1,6) top-left, etc.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the three choices at turn 4.\n\nOption 1: Move down to (5,2) at turn 4.\n\nNew state: turn 4, snake [(5,2), (5,3)], head dir down.\n\nTurn 5: from (5,2), dir down, can go D, L, R.\n\n- If D to (5,1): then at (5,1), dir down.\n\nThen turn 6: from (5,1), dir down, can go L to (4,1) or R to (6,1), cannot D to (5,0) wall, cannot U to (5,2) reverse and body there.\n\nIf go L to (4,1), eat food, grow to length 3, positions [(4,1), (5,1), (5,2)], head dir left.\n\nThen turn 7: from (4,1), dir left, can go L, U, D? Current dir left, so can go L (left), U (up), D (down), but not R (right) opposite.\n\nPossible moves:\n\nL to (3,1): but (3,1) is obstacle! Wall, collision.\n\nU to (4,2): (4,2) is free, no food.\n\nD to (4,0): y=0 wall, invalid.\n\nSo only possible move is U to (4,2).\n\nMove U to (4,2), no food, new positions: head to (4,2), body: previous head (4,1) to (4,2)? After eating at turn 6, snake is [(4,1), (5,1), (5,2)]\n\nMove to (4,2): new head at (4,2), then since no food, tail moves out. Tail is at (5,2), so it moves to where? New head at (4,2), the body segment at (5,1) moves to (4,1)? Positions: segment 0: (4,1), segment 1: (5,1), segment 2: (5,2)\n\nAfter moving head to (4,2), new segment 0 at (4,2), segment 1 moves to where segment 0 was, (4,1), segment 2 moves to where segment 1 was, (5,1). Since no growth, the last segment is removed, so tail is removed? No.\n\nWhen no food, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, and the tail cell is vacated.\n\nSo from positions: [A, B, C] where A=head, B, C=body, C=tail.\n\nAfter move to new cell D:\n\n- New head at D\n\n- B moves to A\n\n- C moves to B\n\nThen since no growth, C is removed? No, C moves to B's position, but B's position is now occupied by C, and C was tail, so the new positions are [D, A, B] because B moved to A, C moved to B.\n\nLet's index: before move: pos[0] = head, pos[1], pos[2] = tail.\n\nAfter move to new cell: new_head = new cell\n\nThen new pos[0] = new_head\n\nnew pos[1] = old pos[0]  // previous head\n\nnew pos[2] = old pos[1]  // and so on, but for growth, if no food, the last position is removed.\n\nStandard: if no food eaten, the tail is removed, so the new snake has the same length, with head at new position, and each subsequent segment at the position of the previous segment except the last one is gone.\n\nSo for length 3: positions [A, B, C]\n\nAfter move to D, no food:\n\n- New head at D\n\n- New segment 1 at A (previous head position)\n\n- New segment 2 at B (previous position of segment 1)\n\nC is not included, so tail is at B.\n\nNew positions: [D, A, B]\n\nLength same.\n\nIf food eaten, then C remains, so [D, A, B, C] but C was tail, now new tail.\n\nIn this case, at turn 6, after eating at (4,1), snake is [ (4,1), (5,1), (5,2) ]\n\nThen turn 7, move to U (4,2)\n\nNo food at (4,2), so new head at (4,2)\n\nNew segment 1 at (4,1)  // previous head\n\nNew segment 2 at (5,1)  // previous position of segment 1\n\nThe tail (5,2) is not included, so new positions: [ (4,2), (4,1), (5,1) ]\n\nLength 3, head at (4,2), direction up (since moved from (4,1) to (4,2), U).\n\nNow turn 8: from (4,2), dir up, can go U, L, R? Current dir up, so can U (up), L (left), R (right), not D (down) opposite.\n\nPossible:\n\nU to (4,3): (4,3) is free, no food.\n\nL to (3,2): (3,2) is obstacle! Wall.\n\nR to (5,2): (5,2) is where? Current body: positions [ (4,2), (4,1), (5,1) ], so (5,2) is free? Not occupied, no wall, but is it food? No.\n\n(5,2) should be free.\n\nBut moving R to (5,2), from (4,2) to (5,2) is right, which is perpendicular, allowed.\n\nD to (4,1) but down, opposite to current up, not allowed.\n\nSo possible U to (4,3) or R to (5,2).\n\nIf U to (4,3): new head (4,3), no food, new positions: head (4,3), body (4,2), tail (4,1)? After move: new head (4,3), new seg1 at (4,2), new seg2 at (4,1), but (4,1) was seg1, now seg2, and tail was (5,1), removed? Positions before move: [ (4,2), (4,1), (5,1) ]\n\nAfter move to (4,3): new head (4,3), new seg1 at previous head (4,2), new seg2 at previous seg1 (4,1), and previous seg2 (5,1) removed. So new positions: [ (4,3), (4,2), (4,1) ]\n\nHead dir up.\n\nThen turn 9, from (4,3), can go U, L, R.\n\nU to (4,4): free\n\nL to (3,3): free? Not obstacle\n\nR to (5,3): free, but was previous position? No, free.\n\nBut food at (2,5), etc.\n\nThis is getting messy, and I have obstacles like (4,5) above.\n\nBack to turn 4 choice.\n\nIf at turn 5 from (5,2) I go down to (5,1), then at turn 6 I must go L or R.\n\nIf I go L to (4,1) and eat, then at turn 7 I can only go up to (4,2), then at turn 8 from (4,2) I can go up to (4,3) or right to (5,2).\n\nIf go to (4,3), then I can continue.\n\nBut there is an obstacle at (4,5), so going up might be blocked.\n\nFrom (4,3), I can go left to (3,3), etc.\n\nBut let's not simulate all yet.\n\nAnother option at turn 4: move left to (4,3)\n\nAt turn 4: move L to (4,3)\n\nNew snake: [(4,3), (5,3)], head dir left (since moved left).\n\nTurn 5: from (4,3), dir left, can go L, U, D. Not R (right) opposite.\n\nL to (3,3): free, no food.\n\nU to (4,4): free, no food.\n\nD to (4,2): free, no food.\n\nFood at (2,5) is above, but not directly accessible.\n\n(2,5) is at y=5, x=2.\n\nFrom (4,3), I can go up to (4,4), then left to (3,4), etc.\n\nBut there is obstacle at (3,2), (2,2), etc.\n\nAlso, food at (1,2) and (1,6).\n\nAnother food: (1,6) at top-left.\n\nTurn 5: say I go U to (4,4) from (4,3).\n\nNew positions: [(4,4), (4,3)], head dir up.\n\nThen turn 6: from (4,4), dir up, can go U, L, R.\n\nU to (4,5): but (4,5) is obstacle! (4,5) is internal obstacle, wall.\n\nL to (3,4): free\n\nR to (5,4): free? (5,4) was previous tail, but now free.\n\nD to (4,3) reverse, not allowed.\n\nSo can go L to (3,4) or R to (5,4).\n\nIf L to (3,4), then new snake [(3,4), (4,4)], dir left.\n\nThen turn 7: from (3,4), dir left, can go L, U, D.\n\nL to (2,4): free, no food.\n\nU to (3,5): free\n\nD to (3,3): free\n\nFood at (2,5) is close, (2,5) from (2,4) or (3,5).\n\nSimilarly, I can reach it.\n\nBut let's see the third option at turn 4: move right to (6,3)\n\nTurn 4: move R to (6,3)\n\nNew snake: [(6,3), (5,3)], head dir right.\n\nTurn 5: from (6,3), dir right, can go R, U, D. Not L (left) opposite.\n\nR to (7,3): but x=7 wall, death.\n\nCannot.\n\nU to (6,4): free\n\nD to (6,2): free\n\nSo must go U or D.\n\nSay go U to (6,4), new positions [(6,4), (6,3)], dir up.\n\nTurn 6: from (6,4), dir up, can go U, L, R.\n\nU to (6,5): free\n\nL to (5,4): free\n\nR to (7,4) wall, invalid.\n\nD to (6,3) reverse, not allowed.\n\nSo U to (6,5) or L to (5,4).\n\nIf U to (6,5), then [(6,5), (6,4)], dir up.\n\nThen turn 7: from (6,5), dir up, can go U to (6,6), but y=6 not wall? y=6 is not border, y=7 is wall, so (6,6) is playable, but y=6, U to (6,7) would be wall, but (6,6) U is to (6,7) which is wall, so cannot.\n\nFrom (6,5) U to (6,6): y=6, U to (6,6) from (6,5) is to (6,6), which is valid, since y=6 <=6? y from 1 to 6, y=6 is top, U to (6,7) invalid, but (6,6) is within bounds.\n\nU to (6,6): free, no food.\n\nL to (5,5): free\n\nR to (7,5) wall, invalid.\n\nD to (6,4) reverse, not allowed.\n\nSo at turn 7 from (6,5), can go U to (6,6) or L to (5,5).\n\nIf go to (6,6), then at edge, limited moves.\n\nNo food nearby, so this path might not be efficient for eating food soon.\n\nBack to turn 4.\n\nI need to prioritize eating food that is closer or safer.\n\nAlso, life span: all food has long life, except that (4,1) has life span 6 from turn 4, so after turn 9 it disappears, similarly others.\n\nBut since we are at turn 4, we have time.\n\nBut snake is small, so eating early is good to grow and have more space.\n\nBut need to avoid dead ends.\n\nFor example, if I go down to (5,2) at turn 4, then at turn 5 if I go to (5,1), then at turn 6 I must go left or right.\n\nIf I go left to (4,1) and eat, then I am at (4,1) with only one way out: up to (4,2), as we saw, because left is obstacle, down is wall, right is body or something.\n\nAt (4,1), after eating, snake is at (4,1), (5,1), (5,2), so cells occupied, but from (4,1), I can only move up to (4,2), as we had.\n\nThen at (4,2), I can go up to (4,3) or right to (5,2), but (5,2) is occupied by tail? At that point, positions are [(4,2), (4,1), (5,1)], so (5,2) is free.\n\nMoving to (5,2) is possible.\n\nThen from (5,2), I can go left, up, down, etc.\n\nBut there is obstacle at (4,5), which might block going up later.\n\nSimilarly, if at turn 5 from (5,2) I go left to (4,2) instead of down.\n\nAt turn 5 from (5,2), I can go L to (4,2).\n\nThen new snake [(4,2), (5,2)], head dir left.\n\nThen turn 6: from (4,2), dir left, can go L, U, D.\n\nL to (3,2): but (3,2) obstacle, invalid.\n\nU to (4,3): free\n\nD to (4,1): free, and has food at (4,1)\n\nR to (5,2) reverse, not allowed, and body there.\n\nSo can go U to (4,3) or D to (4,1).\n\nIf go D to (4,1), eat food, grow to length 3, positions [(4,1), (4,2), (5,2)]? After move to (4,1), eat food, so new head (4,1), previous head (4,2) becomes body, and (5,2) becomes body, so [(4,1), (4,2), (5,2)]\n\nHead dir down (since moved down from (4,2) to (4,1)).\n\nThen turn 7: from (4,1), dir down, can go L, R, D? D to (4,0) wall, invalid.\n\nL to (3,1) obstacle, invalid.\n\nR to (5,1): free, no food.\n\nU to (4,2) but up, opposite to down, not allowed.\n\nSo only possible move R to (5,1).\n\nMove to (5,1), no food, new positions: head (5,1), body (4,1), tail (4,2)? Positions before: [ (4,1), (4,2), (5,2) ]\n\nAfter move to (5,1): new head (5,1), new seg1 at (4,1), new seg2 at (4,2), and tail (5,2) removed, so new [(5,1), (4,1), (4,2)]\n\nHead dir right (since from (4,1) to (5,1) is right).\n\nThen turn 8: from (5,1), dir right, can go R, U, D.\n\nR to (6,1): free\n\nU to (5,2): free, but was previous? No\n\nD to (5,0) wall, invalid.\n\nL to (4,1) reverse, not allowed.\n\nSo can go R to (6,1) or U to (5,2).\n\nIf U to (5,2), then new positions [(5,2), (5,1), (4,1)], etc.\n\nBut this seems survivable, but I am in the bottom area.\n\nPerhaps better to go for other food.\n\nNow, the food at (2,5) might be easier to reach from left move.\n\nAt turn 4, move left to (4,3).\n\nThen from (4,3), I can go up to (4,4) at turn 5.\n\nThen from (4,4), at turn 6, as before, can go L to (3,4) or R to (5,4).\n\nSay go L to (3,4), then at (3,4), I can go L to (2,4), U to (3,5), D to (3,3).\n\n(2,5) is at (2,5), so from (2,4) I can go up to (2,5) or from (3,5) left to (2,5).\n\nLet's say at turn 6 from (4,4) go L to (3,4), new snake [(3,4), (4,4)], dir left.\n\nTurn 7: from (3,4), dir left, go L to (2,4), no food, new [(2,4), (3,4)], dir left.\n\nTurn 8: from (2,4), dir left, can go L to (1,4), U to (2,5), D to (2,3).\n\n(2,5) has food, so I can go U to (2,5) and eat.\n\nFrom (2,4) to (2,5) is up, which is perpendicular, allowed.\n\nEat food at (2,5), grow to length 3.\n\nSimilarly, I can reach it in fewer turns.\n\nFrom turn 4: move L to (4,3) at turn 4.\n\nTurn 5: move U to (4,4) at turn 5.\n\nTurn 6: move L to (3,4) at turn 6.\n\nTurn 7: move L to (2,4) at turn 7.\n\nTurn 8: move U to (2,5) at turn 8, eat food.\n\nSo by turn 8, I eat the food at (2,5).\n\nIf I go directly, but with obstacles.\n\nFrom (4,3) at turn 5, I could go U to (4,4), then to (3,4), etc.\n\nNow, with the down move, to reach (2,5) might take longer.\n\nFor example, from (5,2) or (4,1), I need to go up and left.\n\nBut there is obstacle at (3,2), (3,1), so from (4,2) I can go to (4,3), then (4,4), but (4,5) is obstacle, so I can go to (3,4) or (5,4), etc.\n\nBut it might take more turns.\n\nSimilarly, the food at (1,2) is blocked by obstacles; to reach it, I need to go to (1,1) or (1,3), but (1,3) is free, (1,1) free.\n\nBut (1,2) is surrounded? (1,2) has food, and cells: (1,1), (1,3), (2,2) but (2,2) obstacle, so only (1,1) and (1,3) accessible.\n\nBut from current position, it might be far.\n\nSimilarly, (1,6) at top-left.\n\nBut life span is long for all.\n\nSince I need to maximize score, and all food is +1, I should aim to eat as many as possible, so avoid areas where I might get stuck.\n\nThe bottom area with (4,1) has a dead end if I go there, as we saw, only one way out.\n\nWhereas the left area with (2,5) seems more open.\n\nAlso, after eating (2,5), I can go to other food.\n\nFor example, from (2,5), I can go to (1,6) or (1,2), etc.\n\nBut (1,6) is at (1,6), from (2,5) I can go left to (1,5) or up to (2,6), etc.\n\n(2,6) is free? y=6, x=2, not obstacle.\n\nThen to (1,6).\n\nSimilarly, (1,2) can be reached from (1,1) or (1,3).\n\nBut there is obstacle at (3,6), which is at (3,6), so top might be ok.\n\nNow, for the right move to (6,3), it seems less promising as no food nearby and edge might be risky.\n\nSo probably, moving left or down at turn 4 is better.\n\nBut with down, I can eat (4,1) quickly, but then I am in a corner.\n\nLet's see the tail reward danger, but not applicable now.\n\nAnother thing: food can spawn under body, but here no food under snake.\n\nAt (5,4) there is no food, so no issue.\n\nI think for long-term, moving left to (4,3) at turn 4 is a good start to target (2,5).\n\nThen I can plan the sequence.\n\nThe answer should be the actions for the next few turns, but the format is to specify actions for turns starting from t1=4.\n\n\"Answer Format: Turn t1: action on turn t1, Turn t1+1: action on turn t1+1, ...\"\n\nAnd think 5+ turns ahead, so I need to provide a sequence of actions for multiple turns, at least 5 turns.\n\nBut since the state changes, I need to plan a path.\n\nPerhaps I can provide a plan for 5 turns.\n\nLet's decide on turn 4 action.\n\nI think moving left to (4,3) is better.\n\nThen from there, go up to (4,4) at turn 5.\n\nThen left to (3,4) at turn 6.\n\nThen left to (2,4) at turn 7.\n\nThen up to (2,5) at turn 8 to eat.\n\nBut for 5 turns ahead, from turn 4 to turn 8, but turn 8 is t1+4? t1=4, so turns 4,5,6,7,8.\n\nTurn 4: action\n\nTurn 5: action\n\n...\n\nUp to turn 8 or more.\n\nBut after eating, I need to continue.\n\nSince the food at (2,5) is eaten at turn 8, which is within 5 turns from turn 4? From turn 4 to turn 8 is 5 steps: turn 4,5,6,7,8.\n\nt1=4, t1+1=5, t1+2=6, t1+3=7, t1+4=8.\n\nSo 5 turns: turns 4 to 8.\n\nIn the sequence, I can specify actions for these turns.\n\nBut after that, I need to survive.\n\nBut the format might expect a sequence.\n\nI could provide for 5 turns.\n\nFirst, at turn 4, move left to (4,3).\n\nThen turn 5, from (4,3), move up to (4,4) to head towards (4,5) but (4,5) is obstacle, so not, to go left.\n\nFrom (4,3), at turn 5, I could move up, but also left or down.\n\nBut to go to (2,5), moving up is better.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 6, from (4,4), move left to (3,4).\n\nAt turn 7, from (3,4), move left to (2,4).\n\nAt turn 8, from (2,4), move up to (2,5) to eat.\n\nBut at turn 8, I eat, so I need to specify the action.\n\nNow, is this safe? Let's check the positions.\n\nTurn 4: move L to (4,3), snake: [(4,3), (5,3)]\n\nTurn 5: move U to (4,4), snake: [(4,4), (4,3)]\n\nTurn 6: move L to (3,4), snake: [(3,4), (4,4)]\n\nTurn 7: move L to (2,4), snake: [(2,4), (3,4)]\n\nTurn 8: move U to (2,5), eat food, snake grows: head to (2,5), body: previous head (2,4) and (3,4), so [(2,5), (2,4), (3,4)] length 3.\n\nAll moves are valid, no wall or body collision.\n\nNow, after that, at turn 8, head at (2,5), direction up.\n\nThen I can continue, for example, to go to (1,5) or (2,6), etc., to eat other food.\n\n(1,6) is at (1,6), so from (2,5), I can go left to (1,5), then up to (1,6).\n\n(1,5) is free? Yes.\n\nSimilarly, (1,2) can be reached later.\n\nBut for the answer, I need to provide the sequence for turns starting from 4.\n\nThe format says \"Turn t1: action on turn t1, Turn t1+1: action on turn t1+1, ...\" so I need to specify for each turn.\n\nSince the state changes, the actions might depend, but I think for planning, I can provide a fixed sequence based on current knowledge.\n\nTo be safe, I can provide the actions I planned.\n\nAnother option: at turn 4 move down, but that might lead to dead end.\n\nFor example, if I move down to (5,2) at turn 4.\n\nThen at turn 5, I can move left to (4,2).\n\nThen at turn 6, move down to (4,1) to eat.\n\nThen at turn 7, move up to (4,2) (only choice).\n\nThen at turn 8, from (4,2), I can move up to (4,3) or right to (5,2).\n\nSay move up to (4,3).\n\nThen turn 9, from (4,3), move up to (4,4), but (4,5) obstacle, so cannot go further up, need to go left or right.\n\nBut (4,4) to (4,5) is not possible, so from (4,4) I can go left to (3,4) or right to (5,4).\n\nThen continue.\n\nBut in this case, I ate (4,1) at turn 6, which is earlier than (2,5) at turn 8, but I might be in a tighter spot.\n\nWith the left move, I eat later but in a better position.\n\nSince all food same value, eating sooner or later doesn't matter for score, as long as I eat multiple.\n\nBut with the corner, I might have less mobility.\n\nMoreover, in the left path, no dead end.\n\nAnother food: (1,2) at (1,2), which I can target after.\n\nBut there is obstacle at (2,2), so to reach (1,2), I need to go through (1,1) or (1,3).\n\n(1,1) is bottom-left, which might be risky if I go there.\n\n(1,3) is free.\n\nFrom (2,5), I can go down to (2,4), then to (2,3), etc., but to reach (1,2), from (1,3) or (1,1).\n\nSimilarly, (1,6) is easier.\n\nI think moving left at turn 4 is better.\n\nSo for the sequence:\n\nTurn 4: L (left to (4,3))\n\nTurn 5: U (up to (4,4))\n\nTurn 6: L (left to (3,4))\n\nTurn 7: L (left to (2,4))\n\nTurn 8: U (up to (2,5) to eat)\n\nBut the answer should start from turn 4 and go for several turns, at least 5.\n\nFrom turn 4 to turn 8 is 5 actions: turn 4,5,6,7,8.\n\nt1=4, so turns 4,5,6,7,8.\n\nI can provide that.\n\nTo think ahead, after that, at turn 8, I can go left to (1,5) or up to (2,6), etc., but I don't need to specify beyond.\n\nThe format might expect the actions for the immediate turns.\n\nSince it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", but the answer is the actions.\n\nI think providing 5 turns is fine.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 6, when I move to (3,4), it is free, no issue.\n\nSimilarly all.\n\nNow, for the right move, it might not be good.\n\nSo I'll go with left.\n\nBut at turn 4, moving left, then up, etc.\n\nIn the sequence, I have turn 7 move left to (2,4), which is from (3,4) to (2,4), which is left, and direction was left from previous, so same direction, fine.\n\nThen turn 8 up, perpendicular.\n\nAll good.\n\nTo maximize, I could eat (4,1) first, but with risk.\n\nBut I think the left path is safer long-term.\n\nSo final decision.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while ensuring long-term survival, I have planned a sequence of moves for at least 5 turns ahead (turns 4 to 8). The plan prioritizes reaching the food at (2,5) safely, as it is accessible and avoids dead ends. Moving left at turn 4 positions the snake to navigate around obstacles and approach (2,5) efficiently. The sequence avoids the risky bottom area near (4,1), which could lead to a dead end, and the right edge, which offers no nearby food. All moves comply with movement constraints and avoid collisions.\n\n- **Turn 4**: Move L (left) to (4,3). This avoids the reverse move (up) and starts the path toward (2,5). New head position: (4,3), direction: L.\n- **Turn 5**: Move U (up) to (4,4). This continues toward the target food while keeping options open. New head position: (4,4), direction: U.\n- **Turn 6**: Move L (left) to (3,4). This moves closer to (2,5) and avoids the obstacle at (4,5). New head position: (3,4), direction: L.\n- **Turn 7**: Move L (left) to (2,4). This positions the snake adjacent to the food at (2,5). New head position: (2,4), direction: L.\n- **Turn 8**: Move U (up) to (2,5) to eat the positive food (+1, length increases). This achieves the first food consumption safely. New head position: (2,5), direction: U.\n\nThis plan eats food by turn 8 and maintains flexibility for future moves, such as targeting (1,6) or (1,2) next. Risks are minimized:\n- No wall or body collisions occur during the sequence.\n- The path avoids instant reverses and dead ends (e.g., the bottom-left corner near (4,1) is not entered).\n- Food life spans are sufficient (e.g., (2,5) disappears after turn 13, so eating by turn 8 is safe).\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn } 4\\text{: L} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 5\\text{: U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 6\\text{: L} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 7\\text{: L} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 8\\text{: U}\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I'm the AI playing Snake. I need to maximize my score by eating positive food while avoiding risks. I must think at least 5 turns ahead and prioritize long-term survival over immediate rewards.\n\nThe current turn is t1 = 5.\n\nWalls: Border cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7). Internal obstacles are at (3,2), (4,5), (3,6), (3,1), (2,2). I need to avoid these cells.\n\nSnake positions: Head is at (4,3), and the body is at (5,3). Since there are only two segments, the snake is of length 2. Head direction is L, which means it's facing left. So it just moved left to (4,3) from (5,3), I assume.\n\nFood items:\n\n- (4,1) with life span 5, value 1 (positive)\n\n- (1,6) with life span 5, value 1 (positive)\n\n- (1,2) with life span 6, value 1 (positive)\n\n- (2,5) with life span 9, value 1 (positive)\n\nAll food is positive, no negative food mentioned, so all are good to eat.\n\nLife span: Each food disappears after N turns, and countdown decreases every turn, including current. So for (4,1), life span 5 at turn 5, so it will disappear after turn 5 + 5 - 1? Let's clarify.\n\nThe life span is given at the current turn. So for food at (4,1), life span 5 at turn 5 means it will disappear after turn 9? I need to be careful.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n\nSo at turn t, if life span is L, it will be gone by turn t + L - 1? Or turn t + L?\n\n\"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so at turn t, countdown is L. After turn t, it becomes L-1, and so on, until it reaches 0, and then it disappears.\n\nTypically, if countdown starts at L at turn t, after one turn (turn t+1), it's L-1, and when countdown reaches 0, it disappears. So it exists for L turns, from turn t to turn t + L - 1, inclusive? Let's think.\n\nAt turn t, countdown is L, so it has L turns left including the current turn. After turn t, countdown is L-1, and so on. At turn t + L - 1, countdown is 1, and it can be eaten. Then at turn t + L, it disappears; countdown 0 means gone.\n\nBut the countdown decreases every turn, including current, so at the start of turn t, countdown is L. If not eaten during turn t, at the start of turn t+1, countdown is L-1, and so on. When countdown is 1 at turn t + L - 1, it can be eaten during that turn, and then at turn t + L, it's gone.\n\nFor example, at turn 5, food with life span 5: countdown 5 at turn 5. If not eaten, at turn 6, countdown 4, ..., at turn 9, countdown 1, eaten during turn 9 or disappears at turn 10? I think it's better to think that it disappears after N turns, meaning after turn t + N - 1 or something.\n\nThe rule says: \"Disappears after N turns\". And \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nI think it's standard: at the beginning of turn t, with life span L, it has L turns left. After each turn, countdown decreases by 1. When countdown reaches 0, it is removed, so it can be eaten only when countdown >=1.\n\nSo for (4,1) at turn 5, life span 5, so it can be eaten from turn 5 to turn 9 (countdown 5 to 1), and disappears at turn 10.\n\nSimilarly, (1,6) life span 5 at turn 5, same, disappears after turn 9? Turn 5 to 9.\n\nLet's list:\n\n- (4,1): life span 5 at t=5, so exists turns 5,6,7,8,9; gone at t=10\n\n- (1,6): life span 5 at t=5, exists turns 5-9\n\n- (1,2): life span 6 at t=5, exists turns 5-10 (countdown 6 to 1)\n\n- (2,5): life span 9 at t=5, exists turns 5-13\n\nSnake head at (4,3), direction L (left), so last move was left to (4,3). Body at (5,3), so tail is at (5,3).\n\nPossible moves: I can go U (up), D (down), L (left), or R (right), but no instant reverse. Since head direction is L, I cannot go R (right) immediately because that would be opposite direction. So not allowed.\n\nCurrent direction L, so possible moves: U, D, L. R is reverse, not allowed.\n\nNow, grid: let's sketch the grid.\n\nGrid from (0,0) to (7,7). Walls at borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, so I cannot go there.\n\nInternal obstacles: (3,2), (4,5), (3,6), (3,1), (2,2)\n\nSnake: head (4,3), body (5,3)\n\nFood: (4,1), (1,6), (1,2), (2,5)\n\nSince snake length is 2, and all food is positive, eating any food will increase length to 3.\n\nBut I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n\nFirst, what are the immediate possible moves from (4,3):\n\n- U: up to (4,4)\n\n- D: down to (4,2)\n\n- L: left to (3,3)\n\nR is not possible, reverse.\n\nNow, check for collisions:\n\n- (4,4): is it wall or body? Walls: borders, so x=4,y=4 is within 1 to 6? x from 0 to 7, walls at x=0 and x=7, so x=4 is fine. y=4, y=0 and y=7 walls, so y=4 fine. Internal obstacles: (3,2), (4,5), (3,6), (3,1), (2,2). None at (4,4), so safe.\n\n- (4,2): similarly, x=4,y=2. Not border, internal obstacles: (3,2) is wall, but (4,2) is not listed, so safe. Obstacles are (3,2), (4,5), etc., not (4,2).\n\n- (3,3): x=3,y=3. Not border, internal: (3,2) is wall, but (3,3) not listed, so should be safe. But (3,2) is wall, but (3,3) is different cell.\n\nNow, food: (4,1) is below, at (4,1), which is down from (4,3)? From (4,3) to (4,2) is down, then to (4,1) is further down.\n\nBut (4,1) is food, and it's at (4,1), which might be reachable.\n\nI need to plan multiple turns.\n\nAlso, tail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it kills. But here, tail is at (5,3), head at (4,3), so adjacent? Adjacent means next to, so (4,3) and (5,3) are adjacent horizontally. But the tail is at (5,3), and is there food on tail? No, food is at (4,1), etc., not on tail. So no issue.\n\nFood can spawn under body, but here no food under body, I think. Snake at (4,3) and (5,3), no food there.\n\nNow, let's think about paths to food.\n\nFirst, closest food: (4,1) is at (4,1), which is two steps down from head (4,3): down to (4,2), then down to (4,1). But (4,2) might be safe, but let's see.\n\n(4,1) has life span 5, so it will be gone after turn 9, but since turn 5, it has until turn 9 to be eaten.\n\nSimilarly, (1,2) is at (1,2), which is left and up or something.\n\nHead at (4,3), food at (1,2): so x from 4 to 1 (left), y from 3 to 2 (down), so roughly southwest.\n\n(1,6) at (1,6), north-west.\n\n(2,5) at (2,5), west and north.\n\nNow, internal walls: (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (3,6), (4,5)\n\n(3,1) is wall, (3,2) wall, (2,2) wall, so that blocks some areas.\n\nLet me sketch a grid mentally.\n\nRows y from 0 to 7, bottom? Usually y=0 bottom or top? In coordinates, it might be arbitrary, but let's assume (0,0) is bottom-left or top-left? Not specified, but I can think of it as a grid.\n\nFor simplicity, let's say (0,0) is top-left, so y increases down, x increases right. Or not? In many games, y=0 top, but here no specification. Since walls are x=0/x=7, y=0/y=7, it doesn't matter, but for movement, U and D.\n\nHead direction L, so from (5,3) to (4,3), moved left.\n\nNow, possible moves from (4,3):\n\n- U: (4,4)\n\n- D: (4,2)\n\n- L: (3,3)\n\nNow, I need to think 5 turns ahead.\n\nAlso, after moving, the tail will move. Since snake length 2, after I move, the tail will move to where the head was, so if I go to a new cell, the tail follows.\n\nFor example, if I move to (3,3), head now at (3,3), tail at (4,3), since body was (5,3), but when head moves to (3,3), the body segments follow: head moves to new position, each body segment moves to previous position of the one before it. So for two segments: head was at (4,3), body at (5,3). After head moves to new, say (3,3), then body moves to old head position (4,3). So new positions: head (3,3), body (4,3). Tail is at (4,3).\n\nSimilarly, if I eat food, length increases.\n\nBut to eat food, head must be on food cell when moving to it.\n\nNow, let's consider each possible first move.\n\nOption 1: Move L to (3,3)\n\nThen head at (3,3), tail at (4,3)\n\nNow from (3,3), possible moves: U, D, L, R? Direction: since moved left to (3,3), head direction now L? Or do we update direction?\n\nHead direction is given as current direction, but after move, it changes based on move.\n\nI think we need to keep track of the direction after each move.\n\nAfter moving L to (3,3), head direction is L.\n\nPossible moves: U (up to (3,4)), D (down to (3,2)), L (left to (2,3)), R not possible (reverse).\n\nNow (3,2) is a wall? Internal obstacle (3,2) is wall, so I cannot go to (3,2). So D is invalid.\n\nU to (3,4): is (3,4) safe? Not border, internal obstacles: (3,2) wall, but (3,4) not listed, so ok.\n\nL to (2,3): (2,3) not border, not in obstacles, so ok.\n\nR to (4,3) but that's reverse, not allowed.\n\nSo from (3,3), possible: U or L.\n\nNow, if I go U to (3,4), then head at (3,4), tail at (3,3)? After move to (3,3), positions: head (3,3), body (4,3). Then if move U to (3,4), head to (3,4), body to old head (3,3), so snake: (3,4), (3,3)\n\nTail at (3,3).\n\nDirection now U.\n\nThen from (3,4), can go U to (3,5), D to (3,3) but (3,3) is body, but tail is there, and since tail will move, it might be ok if I move away.\n\nBody collision: head touches any body segment except that the tail is moving, so when head moves to a cell, if that cell is occupied by a body segment that is not the tail, or if after move the head is on a body cell except when it's the tail and the tail moves, it's safe.\n\nRule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo moving into tail cell is safe because tail moves away.\n\nIn this case, from (3,4), if I go D to (3,3), (3,3) is current tail, so it should be safe because tail will move to where body was, but when I move head to (3,3), which is current tail position, then after move, the tail moves to the previous body position, which is (4,3)? Let's think carefully.\n\nBefore move: positions: head (3,4), body (3,3) — only two segments.\n\nIf I move D to (3,3), which is the current body/tail position.\n\nAfter move, head moves to (3,3), but (3,3) was occupied by tail. Since it's the tail, and tail moves away to the previous position? The rule: when head moves to a new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment before it.\n\nSpecifically, for tail: the tail segment moves to where the second last segment was, but since the head moved, the body follows.\n\nSequence:\n\n- Before move: segments: [head: (3,4), tail: (3,3)]\n\n- Move head to new position, say (3,3) — but (3,3) is current tail position.\n\nAfter head moves to (3,3), the tail segment is removed or moved? When head moves to a cell, if it's food, it eats, else just moves.\n\nBut in terms of position: after head moves to (3,3), which was the old tail position, then the tail segment needs to move. Since there are only two segments, the body (which was tail) moves to the old head position? Standard snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, the tail moves to the next position or is removed if not growing.\n\nWhen the snake moves, the head moves to an adjacent cell. If that cell has food, the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move, and a new segment is added at the food position. If no food, the tail moves to the previous position, so the snake slides forward.\n\nIn this case, length 2.\n\nIf no food eaten: head moves to new cell, tail moves to where head was.\n\nIf food eaten: head moves to food cell, tail stays, so length increases by one, and the new tail is the old tail position? Let's clarify.\n\nFrom core rules: when eating positive food, \"length of snake +1\", so when head moves to food cell, it eats it, length increases, so the tail does not move; the head is now on the food cell, and a new segment is added, so the snake grows from the head.\n\nAfter eating, the segment that was tail remains, and a new segment is added at the food position, but since head is there, it becomes the new head, but head moves to the food cell, so the previous head was somewhere, but it's a bit messy.\n\nStandard: positions list: [head, segment1, segment2, ..., tail]\n\nWhen head moves to a new cell, if no food, the tail is removed from its position, head added at new, each body segment shifts.\n\nIf food, head added at new with food, tail not removed, so new segment added.\n\nFor example, here, snake positions: [(4,3), (5,3)] head at (4,3), tail at (5,3).\n\nIf head moves to (3,3), and (3,3) has no food, then new positions: head (3,3), and body moves to old head (4,3), so [(3,3), (4,3)]\n\nTail at (4,3).\n\nIf (3,3) has food, then head moves to (3,3), eats food, tail stays at (5,3), so new positions: [(3,3), (4,3), (5,3)] or something? Head at (3,3), then the previous head (4,3) becomes body, and tail (5,3) remains, so segments: [ (3,3), (4,3), (5,3) ], length 3.\n\nSimilarly for eating.\n\nBack to the situation.\n\nFrom (4,3), if I move L to (3,3), and (3,3) has no food, so new snake: head (3,3), body (4,3)\n\nDirection L.\n\nThen from there, I can go U to (3,4) or L to (2,3) since D to (3,2) is wall.\n\n(3,2) is wall, so D invalid.\n\nU to (3,4) or L to (2,3).\n\nLet's consider going to food.\n\nFood at (4,1) is close. From (4,3), I can go D to (4,2), then from there to (4,1) to eat.\n\nBut (4,1) is food, life span 5, at turn 5, so it can be eaten now.\n\nBut I need to think ahead.\n\nAlso, (4,1) is at (4,1), and internal obstacle at (3,1), which is left of it, but not blocking directly.\n\nFirst, let's list all cells to avoid: walls and obstacles.\n\nBorder walls: all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls.\n\nInternal obstacles: (3,2), (4,5), (3,6), (3,1), (2,2)\n\nSo cells to avoid: all above.\n\nNow, from head (4,3), possible moves:\n\n- U to (4,4): is it safe? (4,4) not wall, not obstacle, ok.\n\n- D to (4,2): (4,2) not wall, not in obstacles list, ok.\n\n- L to (3,3): (3,3) not wall, not obstacle, ok.\n\nR not possible.\n\nNow, if I go D to (4,2), then head at (4,2), and if no food, tail moves to (4,3), so snake [(4,2), (4,3)]\n\nDirection D.\n\nThen from (4,2), I can go to (4,1) to eat food, since (4,1) is food.\n\nFrom (4,2), moving to (4,1) is down, so D.\n\n(4,1) is within bounds, not wall, no obstacle.\n\nIf I go to (4,1) on turn 6, say.\n\nBut let's plan turns.\n\nTurn 5: I need to decide action for turn 5.\n\nThen for turn 6, etc.\n\nBut I need to output actions for turn 5, turn 6, etc., up to 5 turns ahead? The answer format is to output actions for multiple turns, but it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but the output is for the current turn and future turns? The format is \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" but it doesn't specify how many turns to output.\n\nLooking back: \"Answer Format: \\boxed{ Turn \\(t_1\\): action on turn t_1 Turn \\(t_1 + 1\\): action on turn t_1 + 1 ... }\"\n\nIt says \"...\" so I think I need to output a sequence for several turns, but how many? At least for the current turn, and perhaps for a few turns as per my plan.\n\nBut I need to think 5 turns ahead, so I should plan a sequence of at least 5 moves.\n\nSince the state may change after each move, I need to simulate.\n\nAlso, food life span decreases.\n\nLet's list the food and their expiration:\n\n- (4,1): exists turns 5 to 9 (countdown 5 at t5, 4 at t6, ..., 1 at t9, gone t10)\n\n- (1,6): exists turns 5 to 9\n\n- (1,2): exists turns 5 to 10 (countdown 6 at t5, down to 1 at t10, gone t11)\n\n- (2,5): exists turns 5 to 13 (countdown 9 at t5, down to 1 at t13, gone t14)\n\nNow, (4,1) is very close, only two steps away: down to (4,2), then down to (4,1).\n\nBut if I go directly, I can eat it on turn 6 if I move down on turn 5 and turn 6.\n\nTurn 5: move D to (4,2) — no food there, so snake becomes [(4,2), (4,3)]? After move to (4,2), head at (4,2), body at (4,3), tail at (4,3).\n\nThen turn 6: move D to (4,1), which has food, so eat it, length increases to 3, head at (4,1), body: the previous head (4,2) and tail (4,3) stays, so positions: head (4,1), then (4,2), (4,3) — so [(4,1), (4,2), (4,3)]\n\nTail at (4,3).\n\nAnd I scored +1.\n\nBut is this safe? On turn 6, after eating, I am at (4,1), with body at (4,2) and (4,3).\n\nNow, from (4,1), possible moves: U (up to (4,2)), but (4,2) is body, and it's not the tail? Tail is at (4,3), so (4,2) is a body segment, not tail. If I go U to (4,2), it would collide with body.\n\nD to (4,0), but y=0 is wall, so invalid.\n\nL to (3,1), but (3,1) is internal obstacle, wall.\n\nR to (5,1), which is possible, not wall.\n\nSo from (4,1), only possible move is R to (5,1), since U is body, D is wall, L is wall.\n\nR to (5,1) is safe.\n\nThen after moving to (5,1), snake: head (5,1), then body (4,1), (4,2)? Positions: after eating at (4,1), snake is [(4,1), (4,2), (4,3)]\n\nThen move R to (5,1), no food, so head to (5,1), tail moves away from (4,3)? When head moves to (5,1), the body segments move: the segment after head was at (4,2) moves to (4,1)? Standard: the body segment that was behind head moves to where head was.\n\nSegments: index 0: head (4,1), index 1: (4,2), index 2: tail (4,3)\n\nHead moves to new position (5,1), so new head (5,1). Then index 1 moves to old head position (4,1), index 2 moves to old index 1 position (4,2). So new positions: head (5,1), body (4,1), tail (4,2)\n\nNow, from (5,1), I can move U, D, L, R.\n\nBut y=0 is wall, so D to (5,0) invalid.\n\nU to (5,2), possible.\n\nL to (4,1), but (4,1) is now body, not tail. Tail is at (4,2), so (4,1) is body segment. Moving to (4,1) would collide.\n\nR to (6,1), possible.\n\nSo possible: U or R.\n\nBut if I go U to (5,2), etc.\n\nBut the point is, after eating (4,1), I am stuck at (4,1) with only one way out: right to (5,1), and then I can go up or right.\n\nBut there is an obstacle at (4,5), but not immediately relevant.\n\nNow, the problem is that (4,1) is at the bottom, and with walls around, it might be a dead end if I go there early.\n\nMoreover, there is food at (1,2) and (2,5) which are to the left, and I might miss them if I go down.\n\nAlso, (4,1) expires soon, on turn 9, but I can eat it by turn 6.\n\nBut let's see other options.\n\nPerhaps I should not go for (4,1) immediately, because it might trap me.\n\nAnother food: (1,2) at (1,2), which is left and down from (4,3).\n\nTo go to (1,2), I need to move left multiple times, but there are obstacles.\n\nFor example, from (4,3), if I go L to (3,3), then I can go L to (2,3), then to (1,3), then down to (1,2).\n\nBut (1,2) has life span 6, so it can be eaten later.\n\nSimilarly, (2,5) at (2,5), which is left and up.\n\n(1,6) at (1,6), top-left.\n\nBut (1,6) expires on turn 9, same as (4,1).\n\nNow, internal obstacles: (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (3,6), (4,5)\n\n(3,2) and (2,2) are walls, so at y=2, x=2 and x=3 are walls, so I cannot go to (2,2) or (3,2).\n\n(1,2) is at (1,2), which is not wall, but to reach it, from (1,3), I can go down to (1,2), since (1,2) is not listed as wall, only (2,2) and (3,2) are walls, so (1,2) should be free.\n\nSimilarly, (3,1) is wall, but (1,1) might be free, but y=0 and y=7 walls.\n\nLet's list free cells.\n\nGrid: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.\n\nInternal walls: (3,2), (4,5), (3,6), (3,1), (2,2)\n\nSo for example, row y=1: x=3 is wall (3,1), other x should be free, but x=0 and x=7 walls, so for y=1, cells (1,1), (2,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1) are free, (3,1) wall, (0,1) and (7,1) walls.\n\nSimilarly, y=2: (1,2) free, (2,2) wall, (3,2) wall, (4,2) free, etc.\n\ny=3: all free except borders, no internal walls at y=3 except (3,2) but y=2.\n\n(3,2) is y=2.\n\nSo at y=3, all x except borders free.\n\nSimilarly y=4: free, no internal walls.\n\ny=5: (4,5) is wall, so (4,5) occupied, other free.\n\ny=6: (3,6) wall, so (3,6) occupied.\n\netc.\n\nBack to planning.\n\nI need to maximize score, so I should eat as many food as possible, but avoid dying.\n\nGoing for (4,1) might be risky because after eating, I have only one exit, and I might get trapped if not careful.\n\nBut since the grid is open, I can move to other areas.\n\nFrom (4,1), after going to (5,1), I can go up to (5,2), then left to (4,2) but (4,2) might be body or free.\n\nAfter eating (4,1) on turn 6, positions: [(4,1), (4,2), (4,3)]\n\nThen move R to (5,1) on turn 7, positions: head (5,1), body (4,1), tail (4,2)\n\nThen from (5,1), I can go U to (5,2) on turn 8.\n\n(5,2) should be free, not wall.\n\nThen head at (5,2), body: index1 to (5,1), index2 to (4,1)? Old positions: head (5,1), body (4,1), tail (4,2)\n\nMove head to (5,2), no food, so tail moves to (4,1), body moves to (5,1), so new: head (5,2), body (5,1), tail (4,1)\n\nThen from (5,2), I can go U, D, L, R.\n\nD to (5,1) but (5,1) is body, not tail, collision.\n\nU to (5,3), which is possible.\n\nL to (4,2), possible.\n\nR to (6,2), possible.\n\nEtc.\n\nSo I can escape to the right.\n\nBut there are no food nearby on the right, so I might go towards other food.\n\nBut other food are on the left.\n\n(1,2) and (2,5) are left.\n\n(1,6) is also left but up.\n\nNow, (4,1) expires soon, so if I don't eat it, it will be gone.\n\nBut there is (1,2) with life span 6, so it lasts longer.\n\nSimilarly, (2,5) lasts until turn 13.\n\nSo perhaps I should go for the longer-lasting food first.\n\nBut (4,1) is very close, only two moves, so low risk to get it.\n\nThen after that, I can head left to get other food.\n\nFor example, from (5,2) as above, I can go L to (4,2), but (4,2) might be free or not.\n\nIn the sequence above, at some point (4,2) is tail or something.\n\nBut let's not fixate on that.\n\nAnother option: go for (1,2) first.\n\nFrom (4,3), go L to (3,3) on turn 5.\n\nThen from (3,3), I can go L to (2,3) on turn 6.\n\nThen from (2,3), I can go D to (2,2), but (2,2) is internal wall, so invalid.\n\nFrom (2,3), possible moves: U to (2,4), D to (2,2) but wall, so invalid, L to (1,3), R to (3,3) but reverse? Direction: after moving to (2,3) from (3,3), head direction L.\n\nThen from (2,3), possible: U (2,4), D invalid, L (1,3), R not possible (reverse).\n\nSo U or L.\n\nIf I go L to (1,3) on turn 7.\n\nThen head at (1,3), tail at (2,3)? After move to (2,3) on turn 6, snake: head (2,3), body (3,3) if no eat.\n\nTurn 5: move L to (3,3), no food, snake [(3,3), (4,3)]\n\nTurn 6: move L to (2,3), no food, snake [(2,3), (3,3)]\n\nThen turn 7: move L to (1,3), no food, snake [(1,3), (2,3)]\n\nThen from (1,3), I can go D to (1,2) to eat food, since (1,2) is food.\n\nOn turn 8, move D to (1,2), eat food, length 3, positions: head (1,2), body (1,3), tail (2,3)\n\nThen I am at (1,2), with body at (1,3) and (2,3).\n\nFrom (1,2), possible moves: U to (1,3), but (1,3) is body, not tail, collision.\n\nD to (1,1), possible, not wall.\n\nL to (0,2), but x=0 wall, invalid.\n\nR to (2,2), but (2,2) is internal wall, invalid.\n\nSo only possible move is D to (1,1).\n\nThen move to (1,1), no food, snake head (1,1), body (1,2), tail (1,3)? After eating at (1,2), positions: [(1,2), (1,3), (2,3)]\n\nMove D to (1,1), no food, so head to (1,1), body: index1 to (1,2), index2 to (1,3)? Old tail (2,3) moves to old body (1,3) position.\n\nSegments: head (1,2), body1 (1,3), body2/tail (2,3)\n\nMove head to (1,1), so new head (1,1), then body1 moves to old head (1,2), body2 moves to old body1 (1,3), so new: head (1,1), body (1,2), tail (1,3)\n\nThen from (1,1), I can go U to (1,2), but (1,2) is body, collision.\n\nD to (1,0) wall, invalid.\n\nL to (0,1) wall, invalid.\n\nR to (2,1), possible.\n\nSo only R to (2,1).\n\nThen and so on.\n\nBut (1,1) is bottom-left corner, and I can only go right.\n\nSimilar to the (4,1) situation.\n\nIn both cases, eating a food at the edge leaves me with limited options.\n\nFor (4,1), I could go right and up.\n\nFor (1,2), I go down to (1,1), then right to (2,1), etc.\n\nNow, there is food at (2,5) and (1,6).\n\n(2,5) is at (2,5), which is above.\n\n(1,6) at (1,6), top-left.\n\nFrom current position (4,3), I can go up to (4,4), then left, etc.\n\nBut (4,5) is wall, so I cannot go directly up from (4,4) to (4,5).\n\nLet's think about the food at (2,5).\n\n(2,5) has life span 9, so it can be eaten later.\n\nSimilarly, (1,6) expires on turn 9.\n\nPerhaps I should go for (2,5) or (1,6) first.\n\nBut they are farther.\n\nAnother idea: since all food is positive, and I need to maximize score, I should eat the one that is easiest to get without trapping myself.\n\nBut both (4,1) and (1,2) are at edges.\n\n(2,5) is at (2,5), which is not on edge, but surrounded by walls? (2,5) is at x=2,y=5, internal walls: (4,5) at (4,5), (3,6) at (3,6), but (2,5) should be free.\n\nFrom (2,5), I can move to adjacent cells.\n\nSimilarly, (1,6) at (1,6), near top-left corner.\n\nTo reach (2,5) from (4,3): for example, go left to (3,3), then up to (3,4), then left to (2,4), then up to (2,5).\n\n(2,4) to (2,5) up.\n\nBut (2,4) to (2,5) is U.\n\nNow, are there obstacles? (3,4) to (2,4) L, etc.\n\nBut (3,6) is wall, but not blocking.\n\nSimilarly, to (1,6): from (4,3) go L to (3,3), U to (3,4), L to (2,4), U to (2,5), L to (1,5), U to (1,6).\n\nBut (1,6) is food.\n\nNow, life span: (1,6) expires on turn 9, so I need to eat it by turn 9.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut let's estimate the number of turns to reach each food from current position.\n\nFrom (4,3) to:\n\n- (4,1): 2 moves down (D,D)\n\n- (1,2): 3 moves left then down, but with obstacles, so (L to (3,3), L to (2,3), L to (1,3), D to (1,2)) 4 moves\n\n- (1,6): L to (3,3), U to (3,4), L to (2,4), U to (2,5), L to (1,5), U to (1,6) 6 moves\n\n- (2,5): L to (3,3), U to (3,4), L to (2,4), U to (2,5) 4 moves\n\nBut (2,5) can be reached in 4 moves.\n\nSince (4,1) is closest, and I can eat it on turn 6, then I have time to go for others.\n\nAfter eating (4,1), I am at (4,1) on turn 6, with length 3.\n\nThen I can go R to (5,1) on turn 7.\n\nThen from (5,1), I can go U to (5,2) on turn 8.\n\nThen from (5,2), I can go L to (4,2) but (4,2) might be free, or U to (5,3), etc.\n\nFrom (5,2), go U to (5,3) on turn 9.\n\nBut (5,3) was the initial position, but now it might be free.\n\nThen from (5,3), I can go L to (4,3) or U to (5,4), etc.\n\nBut I need to go left to reach other food.\n\nFor example, from (5,3), go L to (4,3) on turn 10.\n\nThen from (4,3), go L to (3,3) on turn 11.\n\nThen to (2,3), etc.\n\nBut by turn 11, (1,6) is gone, expired at turn 9.\n\n(1,6) exists only until turn 9.\n\nSimilarly, (4,1) gone at turn 10, but eaten.\n\n(1,2) exists until turn 10, so I can eat it on turn 10 if I reach.\n\nBut from above, on turn 10, I might be at (5,3) or something.\n\nLet's simulate with eating (4,1) first.\n\nTurn 5: move D to (4,2)  -- no food, snake: head (4,2), body (4,3)  direction D\n\nTurn 6: move D to (4,1)  -- eat food, snake grows: head (4,1), body (4,2), body (4,3)  length 3, direction D\n\nTurn 7: move R to (5,1)  -- no food, snake: head (5,1), body (4,1), tail (4,2)  direction R\n\nTurn 8: move U to (5,2)  -- no food, snake: head (5,2), body (5,1), tail (4,1)  direction U\n\nTurn 9: move U to (5,3)  -- no food, snake: head (5,3), body (5,2), tail (5,1)  direction U\n\nTurn 10: from (5,3), possible moves: U to (5,4), D to (5,2) but (5,2) is body, collision, L to (4,3), R to (6,3)\n\nL to (4,3) or U to (5,4) or R to (6,3)\n\n(4,3) is free, not body.\n\nAt this point, food (1,2) exists until turn 10, so can be eaten on turn 10.\n\nBut I am at (5,3), (1,2) is at (1,2), far away, 4 moves at least, so I cannot reach it on turn 10 from here.\n\nSimilarly, (2,5) exists until turn 13, so I can go for it.\n\nFrom (5,3) on turn 10, I can go L to (4,3), then to (3,3), etc. to (2,5).\n\nBut (2,5) is at (2,5), so from (4,3) to (3,3) L, (3,3) to (3,4) U, (3,4) to (2,4) L, (2,4) to (2,5) U, 4 moves.\n\nSo from turn 10 position (5,3), to (4,3) turn 11, (3,3) turn 12, (3,4) turn 13, (2,4) turn 14, but (2,5) expired after turn 13, so on turn 14 it's gone, I miss it.\n\n(2,5) life span 9 at t5, exists turns 5 to 13 (countdown 1 at t13), so can be eaten on turn 13.\n\nOn turn 13, I am at (3,4) if I move as above, which is adjacent to (2,5)? (3,4) to (2,5) is not adjacent; adjacent cells are U,D,L,R, so (3,4) to (2,5) is diagonal, not directly adjacent.\n\nFrom (3,4), I can go U to (3,5), L to (2,4), D to (3,3), R to (4,4)\n\nNot directly to (2,5).\n\n(2,5) is at (2,5), so from (2,4) I can go U to (2,5), or from (1,5) R, etc.\n\nIn the path, on turn 13, if I am at (3,4), I can go L to (2,4) on turn 13, then from (2,4) go U to (2,5) on turn 14, but on turn 14, (2,5) is gone if countdown 0 at turn 14.\n\nAt turn 13, countdown for (2,5) is 1, so it can be eaten on turn 13.\n\nIf I am at (2,4) on turn 13, I can go U to (2,5) to eat it on turn 13.\n\nBut in the sequence, from turn 10: at (5,3)\n\nTurn 11: move L to (4,3) -- no food, snake head (4,3), body (5,3), tail (5,2)? Previous: at turn 10, snake head (5,3), body (5,2), tail (5,1)\n\nMove L to (4,3), no food, so head to (4,3), body to (5,3), tail to (5,2) -- new: head (4,3), body (5,3), tail (5,2)\n\nTurn 12: move L to (3,3) -- no food, head (3,3), body (4,3), tail (5,3)\n\nTurn 13: move U to (3,4) -- no food, head (3,4), body (3,3), tail (4,3)\n\nNow at (3,4), not at (2,4), so I cannot reach (2,5) on turn 13.\n\nIf on turn 12 from (4,3) I go U to (4,4) instead of L to (3,3), but I need to go left for (2,5).\n\nFrom (4,3) on turn 11, I can go U to (4,4) or L to (3,3).\n\nBut to reach (2,5), better to go to (3,3) first.\n\nBut from (3,3) on turn 12, I can go U to (3,4) or L to (2,3).\n\nIf I go L to (2,3) on turn 12.\n\nThen at (2,3), then on turn 13 I can go U to (2,4), then on turn 14 U to (2,5) but (2,5) gone.\n\nOr from (2,3) to (2,4) on turn 13, then to (2,5) on turn 14, gone.\n\nBut (2,5) can be eaten on turn 13, so I need to be at (2,5) on turn 13 or before.\n\nFrom current position on turn 5, if I go directly to (2,5), it takes 4 moves, so on turn 9 I can eat it.\n\nTurn 5: start at (4,3)\n\nTurn 6: move to (3,3)\n\nTurn 7: move to (3,4) U\n\nTurn 8: move to (2,4) L\n\nTurn 9: move to (2,5) U, eat.\n\n(2,5) exists on turn 9, countdown 5 at t5, at t9 countdown 1, can be eaten.\n\nSimilarly, (1,6) can be eaten by turn 9.\n\nBut if I go for (2,5) directly, I can eat on turn 9.\n\nThen I can go for other food.\n\nBut (4,1) expires on turn 9, so I can eat it before or after.\n\nIf I go for (2,5) first, on turn 9, then (4,1) is still available on turn 9, but I am at (2,5), far from (4,1), 5 moves away, so cannot reach on same turn.\n\nMinimum moves from (2,5) to (4,1): for example, D to (2,4), D to (2,3), R to (3,3), R to (4,3), D to (4,2), D to (4,1) 6 moves, so on turn 10 or later, but (4,1) gone after turn 9.\n\nSo I cannot eat both (2,5) and (4,1) because (4,1) expires on turn 9 and (2,5) on turn 9 I eat it, so (4,1) missed.\n\nSimilarly, (1,6) expires on turn 9.\n\n(1,2) expires on turn 10.\n\nSo possible to eat (2,5) on turn 9 and (1,2) on turn 10 if I can reach.\n\nFrom (2,5) on turn 9, to (1,2): (2,5) to (2,4) D, (2,4) to (2,3) D, (2,3) to (1,3) L, (1,3) to (1,2) D, 4 moves, so on turn 13, but (1,2) exists until turn 10, gone on turn 11, so missed.\n\n(1,2) life span 6 at t5, exists turns 5 to 10, eaten on turn 10 or before.\n\nOn turn 10, I am at (2,5) if I ate on turn 9, then from (2,5) to (1,2) in 4 moves, cannot on turn 10.\n\nSo I need to prioritize which food to eat.\n\nAvailable food:\n\n- (4,1): can be eaten by turn 9, close to start.\n\n- (1,6): can be eaten by turn 9, but far.\n\n- (1,2): can be eaten by turn 10, far.\n\n- (2,5): can be eaten by turn 13, less urgent.\n\nSince (4,1) is close and expiring soon, I should eat it first to not miss it.\n\nThen after that, go for (2,5) which has longer life.\n\n(1,2) also expiring on turn 10, but farther.\n\nLet's see if I can eat (4,1) and then (2,5).\n\nFrom earlier, after eating (4,1) on turn 6, I am at (4,1).\n\nThen I need to go to (2,5).\n\nFrom (4,1) on turn 6, I went to (5,1) on turn 7, (5,2) on turn 8, (5,3) on turn 9.\n\nThen from (5,3) on turn 10, go L to (4,3) turn 10, L to (3,3) turn 11, U to (3,4) turn 12, L to (2,4) turn 13, U to (2,5) turn 14, but (2,5) gone on turn 14.\n\nOn turn 13, I am at (2,4), and (2,5) can be eaten on turn 13 if I go U.\n\nFrom turn 10: at (5,3)\n\nTurn 11: L to (4,3)\n\nTurn 12: U to (4,4) -- instead of L to (3,3), go U to (4,4) to be closer to (2,5)? (4,4) to (2,5) is not direct.\n\nFrom (4,3) on turn 11, go U to (4,4) turn 11.\n\nThen turn 12: L to (3,4) turn 12.\n\nThen turn 13: L to (2,4) turn 13.\n\nThen turn 14: U to (2,5) but gone.\n\nOr from (3,4) on turn 13, I can go U to (3,5), but (3,5) is free? Internal walls: (4,5) is wall, but (3,5) not listed, so free.\n\n(3,5) to (2,5) is L, but not adjacent; (3,5) and (2,5) are adjacent left? x from 3 to 2, same y, so yes, L from (3,5) to (2,5).\n\nBut at turn 13, I am at (2,4) or (3,4), not at (3,5).\n\nTo be at (3,5) on turn 13.\n\nFrom turn 11: at (4,3) or (4,4)\n\nLet's start from turn 5.\n\nTurn 5: move D to (4,2) -- to go to (4,1)\n\nTurn 6: move D to (4,1) eat, snake at (4,1),(4,2),(4,3)\n\nTurn 7: move R to (5,1) , snake (5,1),(4,1),(4,2)\n\nTurn 8: move U to (5,2) , snake (5,2),(5,1),(4,1)\n\nTurn 9: move U to (5,3) , snake (5,3),(5,2),(5,1)\n\nTurn 10: move L to (4,3) , snake (4,3),(5,3),(5,2)\n\nTurn 11: move U to (4,4) , snake (4,4),(4,3),(5,3)\n\nTurn 12: move L to (3,4) , snake (3,4),(4,4),(4,3)\n\nTurn 13: move U to (3,5) , snake (3,5),(3,4),(4,4)\n\nThen from (3,5), I can go L to (2,5) on turn 14, but (2,5) gone.\n\nOn turn 13, I am at (3,5), and (2,5) is adjacent left, so I can go L to (2,5) on turn 13 if it exists.\n\nAt turn 13, countdown for (2,5) is 1, so it can be eaten on turn 13.\n\nSo on turn 13, move L to (2,5) from (3,5), eat it.\n\nPerfect.\n\nSo sequence:\n\nTurn 5: D to (4,2)\n\nTurn 6: D to (4,1) eat\n\nTurn 7: R to (5,1)\n\nTurn 8: U to (5,2)\n\nTurn 9: U to (5,3)\n\nTurn 10: L to (4,3)\n\nTurn 11: U to (4,4)\n\nTurn 12: L to (3,4)\n\nTurn 13: L to (2,5) eat\n\nOn turn 13, from (3,4) to (2,5) is not adjacent; (3,4) to (2,5) is diagonal, not allowed. Only U,D,L,R.\n\n(3,4) to (2,4) L or to (3,5) U or to (4,4) R or to (3,3) D.\n\nNot directly to (2,5).\n\nSo on turn 12, at (3,4), I cannot reach (2,5) in one move.\n\nOn turn 13, I need to be at a cell adjacent to (2,5) to eat it.\n\nAdjacent cells to (2,5): (2,4), (2,6), (1,5), (3,5)\n\n(2,6): y=6, (3,6) is wall, but (2,6) not listed, so free? Internal walls: (3,6) at (3,6), so (2,6) is free.\n\n(1,5) free.\n\n(3,5) free.\n\n(2,4) free.\n\nSo from turn 12 position, I need to be at one of these on turn 13 to move to (2,5) on turn 13.\n\nIn the sequence, on turn 12, I am at (3,4).\n\nFrom (3,4), I can go U to (3,5) on turn 12, for example.\n\nAdjust the sequence.\n\nTurn 5: D to (4,2)\n\nTurn 6: D to (4,1) eat\n\nTurn 7: R to (5,1)\n\nTurn 8: U to (5,2)\n\nTurn 9: U to (5,3)\n\nTurn 10: L to (4,3)\n\nTurn 11: U to (4,4)\n\nNow on turn 11, at (4,4)\n\nTurn 12: instead of L to (3,4), go U to (4,5)? But (4,5) is internal wall, cannot.\n\n(4,5) is wall, so I cannot go U from (4,4) to (4,5).\n\nFrom (4,4), possible moves: U to (4,5) wall, invalid; D to (4,3) but (4,3) is body, collision? At turn 11, snake: after move to (4,4), positions: head (4,4), body (4,3), tail (5,3)? Let's track.\n\nAfter turn 10: head (4,3), body (5,3), tail (5,2)\n\nTurn 10: move L to (4,3), no food, so head to (4,3), body to (5,3), tail to (5,2) -- snake (4,3),(5,3),(5,2)\n\nTurn 11: move U to (4,4), no food, head to (4,4), body to (4,3), tail to (5,3) -- snake (4,4),(4,3),(5,3)\n\nNow from (4,4), possible moves: U to (4,5) wall, invalid; D to (4,3) but (4,3) is body, not tail, so collision; L to (3,4), possible; R to (5,4), possible.\n\nSo only L or R.\n\nGo L to (3,4) on turn 11? Turn 11 action is U to (4,4), so turn 12 from (4,4) move L to (3,4)\n\nThen snake: head (3,4), body (4,4), tail (4,3)\n\nThen turn 13: from (3,4), move U to (3,5)  -- no food, head (3,5), body (3,4), tail (4,4)\n\nThen turn 14: move L to (2,5) to eat, but (2,5) gone.\n\nOn turn 13, at (3,4), I can move to (3,5) or (2,4) or (3,3), but not to (2,5) directly.\n\nFrom (3,4) to (2,4) L, then from (2,4) to (2,5) U on turn 14.\n\nBut (2,5) gone.\n\nTo eat on turn 13, I need to be at (2,4), (2,6), (1,5), or (3,5) on turn 13.\n\nFor example, on turn 12, if I am at (3,5), I can go L to (2,5) on turn 13.\n\nHow to be at (3,5) on turn 12.\n\nFrom turn 11 at (4,4), I can only go L to (3,4) or R to (5,4).\n\nSay turn 11: at (4,4) move L to (3,4) on turn 11? Turn 11 action is U to (4,4), so positions at start of turn 11: head (4,3), etc., after move U to (4,4), so at end of turn 11, head at (4,4).\n\nTurn 12: from (4,4), move L to (3,4) -- head to (3,4), body to (4,4), tail to (4,3)\n\nThen turn 13: move U to (3,5) -- head to (3,5), body to (3,4), tail to (4,4)\n\nThen turn 14: move L to (2,5) but gone.\n\nOn turn 12, from (3,4), I can move U to (3,5) on turn 12.\n\nTurn 12: at (3,4), move U to (3,5)\n\nThen turn 13: move L to (2,5) eat.\n\nYes.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 5: D to (4,2)\n\nTurn 6: D to (4,1) eat\n\nTurn 7: R to (5,1)\n\nTurn 8: U to (5,2)\n\nTurn 9: U to (5,3)\n\nTurn 10: L to (4,3)\n\nTurn 11: U to (4,4)\n\nTurn 12: L to (3,4)  -- from (4,4) to (3,4)\n\nAt turn 11: after U to (4,4), snake: head (4,4), body (4,3), tail (5,3)\n\nTurn 12: move L to (3,4), no food, head to (3,4), body to (4,4), tail to (4,3) -- snake (3,4),(4,4),(4,3)\n\nTurn 13: move U to (3,5), no food, head to (3,5), body to (3,4), tail to (4,4) -- snake (3,5),(3,4),(4,4)\n\nTurn 14: move L to (2,5), but (2,5) life span: at turn 5, life span 9, countdown 9, so at turn 14, countdown 9 - (14-5) = 9-9=0, so gone. Countdown decreases every turn including current, so at turn 5, countdown 9? Life span N at turn t means countdown N at turn t.\n\nAt turn t, countdown C, after turn, C-1.\n\nAt turn 5, C=9 for (2,5)\n\nAfter turn 5, C=8 at turn 6\n\n...\n\nAt turn 13, C=9 - (13-5) = 9-8=1? From turn 5 to turn 13 is 8 turns later? Turns: at start of turn 5, C=9\n\nAfter turn 5, start turn 6, C=8\n\nStart turn 7, C=7\n\n...\n\nStart turn 13, C=9 - 8 =1 (since 8 steps down)\n\nAt start of turn 13, C=1, so it can be eaten during turn 13.\n\nAfter turn 13, start turn 14, C=0, gone.\n\nSo on turn 13, I can eat it.\n\nIn the sequence above, on turn 13, I am at (3,5), and I move to (2,5) to eat.\n\nFrom turn 12: at (3,4) after move L from (4,4)\n\nTurn 12: move to (3,4), so at end of turn 12, head at (3,4)\n\nTurn 13: move U to (3,5) or directly to (2,5)? Not adjacent.\n\nFrom (3,4), move U to (3,5) on turn 13.\n\nThen at (3,5), but I need to move to (2,5) on turn 13, but from (3,5) to (2,5) is L, which I can do on the same turn? No, each move is one action per turn.\n\nOn turn 13, I can move from current position to an adjacent cell.\n\nIf at start of turn 13, I am at (3,4), I can move to (3,5), (2,4), (3,3), or (4,4).\n\n(2,5) is not adjacent to (3,4), so I cannot move directly to (2,5) from (3,4) in one move.\n\nI can move to (2,4) or (3,5), then from there to (2,5) on turn 14, but on turn 14 it's gone.\n\nTo be at a cell adjacent to (2,5) on turn 13, I need to be at (2,4), (2,6), (1,5), or (3,5) at the start of turn 13.\n\nThen on turn 13, I move to (2,5) to eat.\n\nFor example, on turn 12, I am at (3,4), I can move U to (3,5) on turn 12.\n\nThen at start of turn 13, I am at (3,5), then move L to (2,5) to eat on turn 13.\n\nYes.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nTurn 12: from (3,4) move U to (3,5)  -- instead of waiting.\n\nFrom turn 11: at (4,4), move L to (3,4) on turn 11? Turn 11 is U to (4,4), so turn 12 is from (4,4) move L to (3,4)\n\nThen turn 12: move U to (3,5)  -- head to (3,5), body to (3,4), tail to (4,4)\n\nThen turn 13: move L to (2,5) eat.\n\nPerfect.\n\nAnd (2,5) can be eaten on turn 13.\n\nSimilarly, I can eat (4,1) on turn 6 and (2,5) on turn 13.\n\nI missed (1,2) and (1,6), but they expired earlier, so not possible.\n\n(1,2) expired on turn 10, (1,6) on turn 9.\n\nSo with this plan, I eat two food: (4,1) and (2,5).\n\nIf I go directly for (2,5) first, I can eat on turn 9, but miss (4,1), and (1,2) I might eat if I go directly, but (1,2) is far.\n\nFor example, turn 5: L to (3,3)\n\nTurn 6: U to (3,4)\n\nTurn 7: L to (2,4)\n\nTurn 8: U to (2,5) eat on turn 8? Turn 8 move to (2,5) eat.\n\nThen I have time to go for (1,2), but (1,2) exists until turn 10.\n\nFrom (2,5) on turn 8, to (1,2): (2,5) to (2,4) D, (2,4) to (2,3) D, (2,3) to (1,3) L, (1,3) to (1,2) D, so eat on turn 12, but (1,2) gone after turn 10.\n\nCannot.\n\nGo for (1,2) directly from start.\n\nTurn 5: L to (3,3)\n\nTurn 6: L to (2,3)\n\nTurn 7: L to (1,3)\n\nTurn 8: D to (1,2) eat\n\nThen I can go for (2,5) from there, but (2,5) lasts longer.\n\nBut (4,1) missed.\n\nWith the first plan, I get two food.\n\nNow, is there a way to get more? (1,6) is also there, but expires on turn 9.\n\nFrom (4,3) to (1,6): more moves, cannot reach by turn 9 if I go for (4,1) first.\n\nFor example, minimum moves to (1,6): 6 moves, eat on turn 11, but expired on turn 9.\n\nSimilarly, not possible.\n\nSo best to eat (4,1) and then (2,5).\n\nIn the sequence, I also need to avoid risks, but in this path, no immediate risks.\n\nAnother thing: at turn 5, if I move D to (4,2), is (4,2) safe? Yes.\n\nThen to (4,1), eat.\n\nThen R to (5,1), etc.\n\nIn turn 10, I move L to (4,3), which is fine.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to output actions for several turns, but the sequence I have is from turn 5 to turn 13, but I can output for the first few turns, say up to turn 9 or 10, but since I need to think ahead, but output for as many as I decide.\n\nPerhaps output for the current turn and the next 4 or 5 turns.\n\nBut in the plan, I have a path to eat two food.\n\nTo be precise, let's list the actions.\n\nAlso, for turn 5, I move D.\n\nBut let's confirm the head direction.\n\nCurrent head direction L, moving D, which is not reverse, so allowed.\n\nThen after moving D, direction down.\n\nThen move D again, to (4,1).\n\nThen move R, to (5,1), direction right.\n\nEtc.\n\nNow for the output, I think I should output a sequence of actions starting from turn 5.\n\nSince the state changes, but for the answer, I can output the actions I plan.\n\nBut the food may not be eaten by others, so it's fine.\n\nSo for turn 5: D\n\nTurn 6: D\n\nTurn 7: R\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: L\n\nAnd so on, but perhaps for the box, I can put up to turn 10 or so.\n\nSince the instruction says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", I should show at least 5 actions.\n\nBut for the answer format, it's open-ended.\n\nPerhaps I can output:\n\nTurn 5: D\n\nTurn 6: D\n\nTurn 7: R\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nThat's 5 actions.\n\nBut in this, I eat on turn 6, then move around.\n\nTo show more, but I think it's fine.\n\nBut in the sequence, after turn 9, I go to (4,3) on turn 10, etc.\n\nBut for the box, I'll put 5 actions.\n\nBut let's make sure it's safe.\n\nAnother thing: at turn 6, when I eat (4,1), I am at (4,1), and only can go R, which is safe.\n\nThen no problem.\n\nIf I don't go for (4,1), I might go for other, but (4,1) is close and expiring, so better to eat it.\n\nFor example, from (4,3), go U to (4,4) on turn 5.\n\nThen I can go left to (3,4), etc. to (2,5), but (4,1) might be missed.\n\nSo I think D on turn 5 is good.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 5: D (down)\n\nTurn 6: D (down) to eat (4,1)\n\nTurn 7: R (right)\n\nTurn 8: U (up)\n\nTurn 9: U (up)\n\nThen for later, I can go L to (4,3) on turn 10, etc.\n\nBut for output, up to turn 9.\n\nThe answer should be in the box.\n\nAlso, the action should be specified as U, D, L, R.\n\nSo for turn 5: D\n\nTurn 6: D\n\nTurn 7: R\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nAnd since I thought ahead to eat (2,5), it's fine.\n\nTo include the direction, but I think just the action.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while ensuring long-term survival, the AI must prioritize eating the positive food at (4,1) first, as it is the closest and expires soon (life span 5 at turn 5, so it disappears after turn 9). Eating it on turn 6 allows the snake to gain length and score early. After that, the snake should navigate towards the food at (2,5), which has a longer life span (until turn 13), to eat it around turn 13. This plan avoids risks such as collisions with walls, obstacles, or the snake's own body.\n\n### Key Considerations for the Plan:\n- **Immediate Action (Turn 5)**: From the starting position at (4,3) with direction left (L), moving down (D) to (4,2) is safe and positions the snake to eat (4,1) on the next turn.\n- **Eating (4,1) on Turn 6**: Moving down again to (4,1) eats the food, increasing length to 3. After eating, the snake is at (4,1) with limited moves (only right is safe due to walls and body), so moving right (R) to (5,1) on turn 7 is necessary.\n- **Path to (2,5)**: After escaping the bottom edge, the snake moves up to (5,2) on turn 8 and (5,3) on turn 9. This clears space to then move left to (4,3) on turn 10 and up to (4,4) on turn 11, setting up a path to reach (2,5) by turn 13.\n- **Risk Avoidance**: \n  - No wall or obstacle collisions in the path (e.g., (4,2) and (4,1) are free; (5,1), (5,2), (5,3) are free).\n  - Body collision is avoided: for example, on turn 6, moving to (4,1) is safe as the tail moves away; on later turns, moves are into free cells.\n  - The food at (1,6) and (1,2) expire by turn 10 and are not reachable without missing (4,1) or (2,5), so they are skipped to prioritize achievable food.\n- **5+ Turns Ahead**: The sequence below plans up to turn 9, but the full path to eat (2,5) by turn 13 is considered (e.g., turn 10: L to (4,3); turn 11: U to (4,4); turn 12: L to (3,4); turn 13: L to (2,5) to eat). This ensures two food are eaten for a score of +2.\n\n### Action Sequence (Turns 5 to 9):\n- Turn 5: Move down (D) to (4,2) – positions for eating (4,1) next turn; direction changes to down.\n- Turn 6: Move down (D) to (4,1) – eats food, length increases to 3; direction down.\n- Turn 7: Move right (R) to (5,1) – escapes the bottom edge; direction right.\n- Turn 8: Move up (U) to (5,2) – navigates toward open area; direction up.\n- Turn 9: Move up (U) to (5,3) – continues to clear space for future moves; direction up.\n\nThis sequence is safe (no collisions) and maximizes score by securing the expiring (4,1) while setting up to eat (2,5) later.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 5: D \\\\\nTurn 6: D \\\\\nTurn 7: R \\\\\nTurn 8: U \\\\\nTurn 9: U\n}",
