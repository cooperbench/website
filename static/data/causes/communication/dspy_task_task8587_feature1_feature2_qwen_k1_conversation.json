Modified `receive` method in dspy/streaming/streaming_listener.py (line 169) to pass `is_last_chunk=self.stream_end`\n\nI've coordinated with you to avoid merge conflicts by working on non-overlapping line ranges.

Added end_buffer_size parameter to StreamListener.__init__ with default value 10\n2. Added validation for end_buffer_size (must be integer between 3 and 64) with exact error messages\n3. Replaced hardcoded queue size check (10) with self.end_buffer_size\n4. Added buffer_watermark field to StreamResponse construction with min(self.field_end_queue.qsize(), self.end_buffer_size) value\n5.
