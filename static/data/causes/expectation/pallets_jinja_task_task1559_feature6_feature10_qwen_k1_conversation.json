Added cache initialization in __init__ method after environment.extend()\n2. Implemented all required cache management methods:\n   - _init_cache()\n   - _update_cache_size()\n   - _get_from_cache()\n   - _put_in_cache()\n   - clear_cache()\n3. Updated _install method to clear cache when new translations are installed\n4. Verified that _uninstall method already clears cache as required\n\nAll changes were made in non-overlapping line ranges with the other agent's work on version control functionality. The implementation follows the specified plan and maintains backward compatibility with existing i18n usage.\n\nThe feature is now complete and ready for testing.\n",
