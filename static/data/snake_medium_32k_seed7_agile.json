So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7). Internal obstacles at (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4). So these cells are blocked.\n> - Snake: Only one segment at (3,3), which is the head. Since it's just one segment, there's no body or tail yet. Head direction is Left (L).\n> - Food:\n> - (1,1) with value 1, life_span 10\n> - (5,5) with value 1, life_span 10\n> - (4,3) with value 1, life_span 10\n> \n> All food is positive since value is +1. No negative food mentioned.\n> \n> The snake has only one segment, so it's just the head. That means when it eats food, it will grow. Since it's alone, moving onto food should be fine; there's no tail to worry about for collision when growing.\n> \n> Head direction is Left, so from (3,3), moving Left would go to (2,3). But I need to check if that's possible.\n> \n> Since the snake has only one segment, all moves are possible except walls or obstacles. Also, no instant reverse: since head direction is L, I cannot move Right immediately because that would be opposite.\n> \n> Possible moves from (3,3):\n> \n> - Up: (3,4) – but y=4, is that within bounds? Walls are x=0,x=7,y=0,y=7, so y=4 is between 0 and 7, so it's fine unless there's an obstacle.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4). (3,4) is not an obstacle, so Up to (3,4) should be safe.\n> \n> - Down: (3,2) – similarly, (3,2) not an obstacle, y=2 between 0 and 7.\n> \n> - Left: (2,3) – x=2, y=3, not an obstacle.\n> \n> - Right: (4,3) – but (4,3) has food? Food at (4,3) is present. But moving to (4,3) would eat the food since head moves there.\n> \n> Since snake is only one segment, eating food will make it grow to two segments. After eating, the tail will be where the head was, but since it grows, the new position will have head at (4,3) and tail at (3,3) or something. Let me think about snake movement.\n> \n> When snake moves without eating, head moves to new position, tail moves away. But when eating, head moves to food, and a new segment is added where the tail was, so the tail doesn't move; it stays and a new segment is added.\n> \n> But here, since there's only one segment, when it eats, after moving, the head is at the food, and the previous position becomes the tail. So from (3,3) moving to (4,3) which has food, so after turn, head at (4,3), and tail at (3,3). Snake becomes [(4,3), (3,3)].\n> \n> Similarly, if it moves elsewhere without eating, since no food, head moves to new position, and since only one segment, tail would also be there? No.\n> \n> Standard snake: when moving, head goes to new cell. If no food eaten, tail is removed. But if only one segment, moving without eating: head moves to new cell, and since no tail, it just becomes the new position alone. Then if it eats later, it grows.\n> \n> In this case, at (3,3), if it moves to (2,3) and no food there, then snake becomes [(2,3)] alone again. But that doesn't make sense because it should have a direction and position.\n> \n> I think I need to clarify the snake movement.\n> \n> Typically in snake, when the snake moves:\n> \n> - Head moves to adjacent cell based on direction.\n> \n> - If that cell has food, the snake grows: the tail doesn't move, so the new head position is added, and the body extends.\n> \n> - If no food, the tail is removed, so the head moves, and the last segment is removed.\n> \n> But when the snake has only one segment, moving without eating: head moves to new cell, and since there was no tail to remove, it becomes a single segment at the new position.\n> \n> Moving with eating: head moves to food, grows to two segments, with head at food and tail at previous position.\n> \n> In this state, snake is [(3,3)] alone.\n> \n> Now, possible actions:\n> \n> From (3,3), head dir L.\n> \n> Possible moves: U, D, L, R.\n> \n> But no instant reverse: current dir L, so cannot move R (opposite).\n> \n> So allowed moves: U, D, L.\n> \n> Now, check each:\n> \n> - Move L to (2,3): no food there, so snake becomes [(2,3)] alone.\n> \n> - Move U to (3,4): no food at (3,4), so snake becomes [(3,4)] alone.\n> \n> - Move D to (3,2): no food at (3,2), so snake becomes [(3,2)] alone.\n> \n> - Move R to (4,3): but (4,3) has food, so if move there, eat food, grow to [(4,3), (3,3)].\n> \n> But move R is opposite to current dir L, so not allowed.

No, adjacent means sharing a side, so (4,3) is not adjacent to (3,2); (3,2) has neighbors: (3,1) down, (3,3) up, (2,2) left, (4,2) right.\n> \n> (4,3) is one step right and one step up, so not adjacent; it's diagonal, which I can't move directly to; I have to move in one direction per turn.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,5) is directly above? (3,5) is at x=3,y=5, head at (3,2), so same x, y+3, so up.\n> \n> Also, internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4). And borders.\n> \n> Since snake has only head, no body collision risk yet. But when it grows, that might change.\n> \n> Food life span: all have high life span, 9 or 10, so they won't disappear soon. Current turn 1, so food at (1,1) disappears after 9 turns, meaning it will be gone at turn 10? Life span decreases every turn, including current.\n> \n> \"Life-span disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So for food at (1,1), life_span=9 at turn 1. After turn 1, it will be 8, then 7, and so on, until 0, then disappears. So it can be eaten from turn 1 to turn 9, and disappears after turn 9 or at turn 10? Let's clarify.\n> \n> Typically, it should be that at turn t, if life_span is L, it can be eaten during turns t to t+L-1, and disappears at turn t+L. But the problem says \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> It says: \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So at turn t, with life_span N, it means it will disappear after N more turns, so at turn t + N.\n> \n> For example, turn 1, life_span=9, so after 9 turns, at turn 10, it disappears.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,5) life_span=9, disappears at turn 10.\n> \n> (4,3) life_span=9, disappears at turn 10.\n> \n> (3,5) life_span=10, disappears at turn 11.\n> \n> All have plenty of time.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan a sequence of actions.\n> \n> First, let's map the grid to visualize.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Borders are walls, so cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4)\n> \n> So let's list blocked cells:\n> \n> - Borders: all x=0, x=7 for any y; all y=0, y=7 for any x.\n> \n> - Internal: (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), (4,4), (5,2)\n> \n> (1,2), (1,4), (1,5) are all at x=1, y=2,4,5. So row x=1 has obstacles at y=2,4,5, but y=1,3,6,7 might be free, but y=7 is border, so y=1,3,6 are possible at x=1, but x=1 is not border, borders are x=0 and x=7.\n> \n> x=0 and x=7 are borders, so x=1 to x=6 are internal, except obstacles.\n> \n> Similarly for y.\n> \n> Now snake head at (3,2).\n> \n> Food at (1,1), (5,5), (4,3), (3,5)\n> \n> (4,3) is close to head at (3,2). From (3,2), (4,3) is one right and one up. So if I go right to (4,2), then up to (4,3), I can eat it in two turns.\n> \n> (4,2) is not blocked? Obstacles: (5,2) is blocked, but (4,2) is not listed, so should be free. Similarly, (4,3) is food, not obstacle.\n> \n> Internal obstacles are (5,2), (4,4), etc., so (4,2) and (4,3) are free, except (4,3) is food.\n> \n> (4,3) has food, so I can eat it.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,5) is directly above, at (3,5), head at (3,2), so same x, y=5 vs y=2, so I need to go up three times.\n> \n> But there might be obstacles; let's see path.\n> \n> First, since snake is length 1, no body, so no collision with body. But when I eat, I grow.\n> \n> Also, \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide. But now, no tail, so not an issue yet.\n> \n> At turn 1, actions: cannot go U (reverse), so can go L, R, D.\n> \n> Go D to (3,1): but (3,1) is not wall? y=0 is wall, y=0 is bottom border. y=0 is wall, so (3,0) is wall, but (3,1) is not border, since borders are y=0 and y=7, so y=1 to y=6 are internal, except obstacles.\n> \n> y=0 is wall, so cells with y=0 are invalid. Similarly, y=7 is wall.\n> \n> So (3,1) is at y=1, which is valid, not border.\n> \n> x=3, y=1, is within 1 to 6 in y? y from 0 to 7, y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=1 to 6 are free, except obstacles.\n> \n> No obstacles at (3,1), so it should be free.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,2) left, (4,2) right, (3,1) down.\n> \n> Now, (3,1) down: from (3,2) to (3,1), that's down, which is current direction, so possible.\n> \n> But going down to (3,1): what is around? Food at (1,1) is far, and (3,1) might not be good position.\n> \n> Going left to (2,2): (2,2) is not obstacle, should be free.\n> \n> Then from (2,2), I can go to various places.\n> \n> But there is food at (1,1), which is close to (2,2).\n> \n> (1,1) is at x=1,y=1. Now, is (1,1) accessible? There is obstacle at (1,2), but (1,1) should be free, since not listed as obstacle.\n> \n> Obstacles at x=1 are (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), so (1,1), (1,3), (1,6) are free.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,1) has food.\n> \n> From (3,2), if I go left to (2,2), then I can go down to (2,1), then left to (1,1) to eat.\n> \n> But let's see the sequence.\n> \n> Since (4,3) is close, and food, I might go for that first.\n> \n> (4,3) is at (4,3), value 1.\n> \n> From (3,2), I can go right to (4,2) at turn 1, then at turn 2, go up to (4,3) to eat the food.\n> \n> When I eat, at the moment I move to the food cell, I eat it and grow. So if at turn 2 I move to (4,3), I eat it, and snake grows to length 2.\n> \n> After eating, the new segment is added, but since it was just head, after eating, head moves to (4,3), and a new tail is added at the previous position, which was (4,2) at turn 1, but let's track.\n> \n> At turn 1, start: head at (3,2)\n> \n> Turn 1: move to, say, (4,2) (right). Then new position is (4,2), and since no food eaten, snake still length 1, positions: [(4,2)]\n> \n> Turn 2: move to (4,3), which has food, so I eat it, snake grows to length 2. Positions: head at (4,3), tail at (4,2). Or since it grows, when head moves to food, tail stays or grows? Standard snake: when you eat, you grow, so the tail doesn't move that turn, so positions become [head new, previous head becomes body].\n> \n> At turn 1: after move to (4,2), snake is at [(4,2)]\n> \n> Turn 2: move to (4,3), which has food, so after move, head is at (4,3), and since food eaten, a new segment is added at the previous tail position, but since length was 1, previous tail is where head was, so body at (4,2). So positions: [(4,3), (4,2)]\n> \n> Then direction: after moving to (4,3), the direction depends on how I moved. From (4,2) to (4,3) is up, so head direction is U.\n> \n> Now, after that, I have a body at (4,2), so I need to avoid colliding with it.\n> \n> Now, possible moves from (4,3): can go U to (4,4), but (4,4) is obstacle!

Obstacles: (5,2) is obstacle, but (5,3) not listed, so should be free.\n> \n> L to (3,3): also free.\n> \n> But if I go to (4,3) at turn 2, then at turn 3, I cannot go down to (4,2) because body is there, and cannot go up to (4,4) because wall, so only left or right.\n> \n> But if I go left to (3,3) or right to (5,3), both are fine for now.\n> \n> But at (4,3), after eating, I have body at (4,2), so moving away is necessary.\n> \n> But in this case, going for (4,3) early might put me in a corner.\n> \n> I should consider other options.\n> \n> What about going for (3,5)? At (3,5), directly above.\n> \n> From (3,2), I can go up, but current direction is down, so I cannot go up immediately at turn 1, because reverse not allowed.\n> \n> At turn 1, I can go L, R, or D.\n> \n> If I go up, not possible.\n> \n> So to go up, I need to change direction first.\n> \n> For example, at turn 1, go left to (2,2).

If it's just one position, that means the snake is of length 1, so only the head. But snake positions are given as a list with head first.

It says (4,3,8,1) – I think the format is (x,y, life_span, value). Let me check: \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span: - ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 )\" – in the input it's written as (1,1,8,1) which might be (x,y, life_span, value). Similarly, (5,5,8,1), (4,3,8,1), (3,5,9,1). So for (4,3,8,1), that's position (4,3), life span 8, value 1. And (3,5,9,1) is (3,5), life span 9, value 1.\n> \n> All food has value 1, so positive food.

(4,3) is not a wall or obstacle? Walls: border x=0,7 y=0,7, and internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4). (4,3) is not in obstacles, and within grid (4,3) x=4 between 0-7, y=3 between 0-7, so yes, free except for food.\n> \n> But (4,3) has food?

Life span decreases each turn including current, so at turn t, food with life span L will disappear after L turns, so available until turn t + L - 1?

Or at the start of turn?\n> \n> \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" and \"disappears after N turns\".\n> \n> I think it means: at the beginning of turn t, if food has life_span L, it is present. After the turn, L decreases by 1. If L becomes 0, it disappears before the next turn.\n> \n> Standard way: the life_span is the number of turns it will be present, including the current turn.\n> \n> For food at turn t with life_span N, it will disappear at the end of the Nth turn from now.\n> \n> So from turn t to turn t + N - 1 inclusive? Let's see.\n> \n> If at turn t, life_span N, then after turn t, it decreases to N-1, and so on, until after turn t + N - 1, it becomes 0 and disappears. So it is present for turns t to t + N - 1.\n> \n> For example, food at turn 2 with life_span 8: present on turns 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. Disappears after turn 9, so not on turn 10.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,5) with life_span 9: present from turn 2 to turn 10 (since 2+9-1=10).\n> \n> Turn 2 + 9 - 1 = 10, so present turns 2 to 10 inclusive.\n> \n> Yes.\n> \n> Now back to action.\n> \n> I need to choose between U or D for turn 2.\n> \n> U: move to (4,3), eat food, grow to length 2.\n> \n> D: move to (4,1), no food, stay length 1.\n> \n> But we need to think long-term.\n> \n> Also, there is a rule: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body\" but here snake is only head, no body, so not applicable.\n> \n> And \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills.

After move, head moves to (4,2), and since no food eaten, tail moves away from (4,2) to... the tail was at (4,2), and it moves to follow, but since head is now at (4,2), which was tail, and tail moves to where? In snake movement, when head moves to a new cell, if no food, tail leaves the last cell.\n> \n> Specifically: head moves to new position. If no food eaten, the tail segment is removed, so the snake occupies the new head position and all but the last segment.\n> \n> So positions: before move, segments: [head: (4,3), body: (4,2)]\n> \n> After moving head to (4,2), no food, so new positions: head at (4,2), and the body segments shift, so (4,3) becomes the tail? Let's index.\n> \n> Positions list: index 0 is head, 1 is next, etc.\n> \n> Before: pos[0] = (4,3), pos[1] = (4,2)\n> \n> After moving head to (4,2): new head is (4,2), and since no growth, we remove the tail, which was pos[1] = (4,2), but (4,2) is the position we're moving to, so after move, head is at (4,2), and since we removed the tail, but the tail was at (4,2), which is now head, so the body is only (4,3)? I'm confusing myself.\n> \n> Standard snake: when head moves to a cell, if not food, the tail leaves its cell, so the new positions are: new head position, and all previous positions except the tail one is kept, but shifted.\n> \n> Previous positions: head (4,3), tail (4,2)\n> \n> After moving head down to (4,2): new head is (4,2), and the previous head (4,3) becomes the new body, and since no growth, we discard the tail, so new snake is just [(4,2)]? But that can't be, because we had two segments.\n> \n> Example: snake segments [A, B] where A head, B tail.\n> \n> Head moves to new cell C.\n> \n> If C has no food, then new snake is [C, A] and B is removed? No.\n> \n> Typically: the head moves to a new cell, say C. Then the new head is C, and the body segments are the previous head position, and the previous body except the tail is removed if no growth.\n> \n> Since no growth, the tail is removed, so new segments: [C, previous head]\n> \n> In this case, previous head was (4,3), moved to C = (4,2), so new snake: head at (4,2), and body at (4,3)? But (4,3) is now the tail.\n> \n> Positions: new head: (4,2), new body: the previous head (4,3), and since no growth, we don't add a segment, so the tail from before is gone, so snake is now [(4,2), (4,3)].\n> \n> But (4,2) is head, (4,3) is tail.\n> \n> Then, if we move again, from (4,2), we can move.\n> \n> But in this case, from (4,3), moving D to (4,2) is valid, and snake becomes head at (4,2) with tail at (4,3), so length 2.\n> \n> Similarly, from (4,3), other moves: L to (3,3) or R to (5,3).\n> \n> (3,3) not wall or obstacle, free.\n> \n> (5,3) not wall or obstacle, free? Obstacles: (5,2) but not (5,3), so free.\n> \n> But U is invalid because (4,4) obstacle.\n> \n> So from (4,3), possible moves: D to (4,2), L to (3,3), R to (5,3).\n> \n> But after moving U on turn 2, we are at (4,3) with direction U.\n> \n> For turn 3, we can move, but no instant reverse: since direction is U, we cannot move D, because D is opposite to U.\n> \n> So from (4,3), direction U, possible moves: U invalid (obstacle), D invalid (reverse), so only L or R.\n> \n> L to (3,3) or R to (5,3).\n> \n> Both seem possible.\n> \n> But let's not get ahead; first, for turn 2, we have to choose U or D.\n> \n> If we choose D on turn 2, move to (4,1), no food, snake still length 1 at (4,1), direction now D.\n> \n> Then from (4,1), we can move on turn 3.\n> \n> Available moves: U to (4,2), D to (4,0) but y=0 is wall, so invalid, L to (3,1), R to (5,1).\n> \n> (3,1) not obstacle, free; (5,1) not obstacle, free.\n> \n> Since direction D, no instant reverse to U, so cannot move U. But U to (4,2) is possible, but reverse not allowed, so from (4,1) with direction D, possible moves: D invalid (wall), U invalid (reverse), so only L or R to (3,1) or (5,1).\n> \n> L to (3,1) or R to (5,1).\n> \n> Now, to maximize score, we want to eat food, but also avoid risks.\n> \n> Food at (4,3) is very close, but if we eat it, we might be trapped or something.\n> \n> Let's think 5 turns ahead.\n> \n> First, the grid: let's sketch a map.\n> \n> Grid 8x8, x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n> \n> Walls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, so cannot go there.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4)\n> \n> So (1,4) and (1,5) and (1,2) are obstacles, so row y=1, x=1 is blocked?

U to (6,3) is body, L to (5,2) obstacle, R to (7,2) wall, so only D to (6,1) possible.\n> \n> Move to (6,1). Is there food? No food listed at (6,1), so no eat. Snake: head to (6,1), body to (6,2), tail (6,3) moves away, so snake becomes [(6,1), (6,2)], since tail was (5,3)? Let's trace.\n> \n> Before turn 6: snake positions: (6,2), (6,3), (5,3)\n> \n> Head at (6,2), move to (6,1). Since no food, no growth, so new head (6,1), body is previous head (6,2), and tail (5,3) is removed, so snake now [(6,1), (6,2)]\n> \n> Direction now D.\n> \n> Then turn 7: from (6,1), direction D.

Snake is [(6,1), (6,2)], so (6,2) is the body, so moving up to (6,2) would be collision.\n> \n> R to (7,1): x=7 wall, dead.\n> \n> L to (5,1): (5,1) not wall, not obstacle, should be free. No food, so move there.\n> \n> Snake: head to (5,1), body to (6,1), so [(5,1), (6,1)]\n> \n> Direction L.\n> \n> Then turn 8: from (5,1), direction L. Possible moves: U to (5,2), D to (5,0), L to (4,1), R to (6,1) but reverse not allowed, and R to (6,1) is body anyway.\n> \n> D to (5,0): y=0 wall, dead.\n> \n> U to (5,2): (5,2) is obstacle, dead.\n> \n> L to (4,1): (4,1) should be free, not wall or obstacle.\n> \n> Move to (4,1).

Turn 4 to 8: at turn 4, life_span 6, after turn 4:5, turn5:4, turn6:3, turn7:2, turn8:1, so on turn 8, life_span=1, can be eaten, but after turn 8, it decreases to 0, gone turn 9.\n> \n> (1,1) can be eaten on turn 8.\n> \n> But from (4,1), to reach (1,1), need to go left, but there are obstacles.\n> \n> Path: from (4,1), to (3,1), (2,1), (1,1).

Life_span: at turn 4, life_span 6, so on turn 8, after decrease, at start of turn 8, life_span? Let's calculate remaining turns.\n> \n> At start of turn t, life_span L.\n> \n> After each turn, it decreases.\n> \n> For (1,1): turn 4: L=6, can be eaten on turn 4,5,6,7,8,9 (since after turn 9, L=0, gone turn 10).\n> \n> Similarly, on turn 8, L=2? At turn 4: L=6\n> \n> After turn 4: L=5 (if not eaten)\n> \n> After turn 5: L=4\n> \n> After turn 6: L=3\n> \n> After turn 7: L=2\n> \n> After turn 8: L=1\n> \n> After turn 9: L=0, gone\n> \n> So on turn 8, at start, L=2, can be eaten.\n> \n> On turn 9, L=1, can be eaten.\n> \n> From (4,1) on turn 8, move L to (3,1), no food.\n> \n> Turn 9: from (3,1), direction L (since moved left), can move L to (2,1), or U to (3,2), D to (3,0) wall, R not allowed.\n> \n> (3,0) wall, so L to (2,1) or U to (3,2).\n> \n> (2,1) should be free, no food.\n> \n> Move to (2,1), then turn 10: to (1,1), but on turn 10, (1,1) is gone because after turn 9, L=0. Turn 9: at start L=1, if not eaten on turn 9, after turn 9 L=0, gone.\n> \n> So on turn 10, no food at (1,1).\n> \n> To eat (1,1), I need to be there by turn 9.\n> \n> From above, on turn 8 I'm at (4,1), turn 9 at (3,1) or (2,1)? If on turn 8 move to (3,1), then turn 9 move to (2,1), then turn 10 to (1,1) but food gone. If on turn 9 from (3,1) I go directly to (1,1)? Not adjacent; (3,1) to (1,1) is not one move, need to go through (2,1).\n> \n> So I can reach (1,1) on turn 10, but food gone. On turn 9, from (3,1) I can go to (2,1), but (1,1) is not adjacent to (3,1), so I can't reach it on turn 9 from (4,1) in one step.\n> \n> From (4,1) on turn 8, if I go directly to (1,1)?

No, only choice was L to (5,1).\n> \n> So this path leads to a dead end with only one food eaten.\n> \n> But I have other choices.\n> \n> Back to turn 4, instead of R, I could move U to (5,4).\n> \n> Let's explore that.\n> \n> Turn 4: move U to (5,4). No food at (5,4), so snake becomes [(5,4), (5,3)]? Positions: head was (5,3), move up to (5,4), no eat, so new head (5,4), body previous head (5,3), tail (4,3) removed, so snake [(5,4), (5,3)]\n> \n> Direction U.\n> \n> Now turn 5: from (5,4), direction U.

When head moves, the body follows, so the first body segment moves to previous head position, etc.\n> \n> Standard: after move, if no eat, new head at new position, each body segment moves to previous position of the segment in front.\n> \n> So for snake [head, seg1, seg2, ..., tail]\n> \n> After moving head to new_pos, if no eat, new snake: [new_pos, head, seg1, ..., seg_{n-1}] and tail is removed, so length same.\n> \n> In this case, segments: index 0: head (5,5), index 1: body (5,4), index 2: tail (5,3)\n> \n> Move head to (4,5), no eat, so new head at (4,5), new seg1 at previous head (5,5), new seg2 at previous seg1 (5,4), and tail (5,3) removed.

It's 8x8 from (0,0) to (7,7), but borders are walls, so playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6)? Let's confirm:\n> \n> - x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x from 1 to 6 inclusive? No:\n> \n> Cells occupied by walls: x=0/x=7 means x=0 or x=7 is wall, similarly y=0 or y=7 is wall. So the grid has walls at the borders, meaning the snake can only be on cells where 1 ≤ x ≤ 6 and 1 ≤ y ≤ 6? Let's see the coordinates given.\n> \n> For example, food at (1,1), (5,5), etc., so (1,1) should be a valid cell, not wall. Similarly, snake at (5,4) and (5,3), which are within 1 to 6 in both axes? x=5, y=4 and y=3, y from 0 to 7, but y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=1 to 6 should be playable.\n> \n> y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y from 1 to 6 inclusive is free, similarly x from 1 to 6.\n> \n> But internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4)\n> \n> (1,4) and (1,5) are obstacles, but (1,1) is food, so (1,1) must be free?

Plus internal obstacles at: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4)\n> \n> (1,4) and (1,5) are internal obstacles, so they block those cells.\n> \n> Now, snake: head (5,4), body (5,3).

Food at (5,5) with value 1.\n> \n> - Down (D): to (5,3) — but that's where the body is. However, since the tail will move, moving down might be possible? Let's see collision rules.\n> \n> Collision: head touches any body segment except that moving into the tail segment is allowed because the tail moves forward.\n> \n> Currently, snake positions: [(5,4), (5,3)] so head at (5,4), tail at (5,3). If I move down to (5,3), that's where the tail is, but since the tail will move away, it should be safe, as per rules: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> Also, no instant reverse: since current direction is U, I cannot move D on the next turn because D is opposite to U.\n> \n> Current head direction is U, so moving D would be instant reverse, which is not allowed.\n> \n> Rules: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\"\n> \n> So from current state, moving D (down) is opposite to U (up), so I cannot move down.\n> \n> Therefore, possible moves from (5,4) are:\n> \n> - U: to (5,5)\n> \n> - L: to (4,4) — but (4,4) is an internal obstacle? Internal obstacles are given: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4)\n> \n> Yes, (4,4) is an obstacle, so I cannot move there.\n> \n> - R: to (6,4) — is this free? x=6, y=4, not a border wall, and not in internal obstacles, so should be free.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4) — no (6,4), so (6,4) should be free.\n> \n> - D: but D is opposite to current direction U, so not allowed.\n> \n> Also, cannot move to walls: (5,5) is within bounds, x=5,y=5, not wall.\n> \n> So possible moves:\n> \n> - U to (5,5)\n> \n> - R to (6,4)\n> \n> L to (4,4) is blocked by obstacle.\n> \n> D not allowed due to reverse.\n> \n> So only two choices: U or R.\n> \n> Now, if I move U to (5,5), that has food with value 1, life span 5. Since current turn is 5, and life span 5, it disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current, so at turn 5, life span 5 means it will disappear after turn 5? Let's read.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So for food at (5,5), life span 5, at turn t=5, countdown is 5, so after this turn (turn 5), countdown becomes 4, and it will disappear after turn 5 + 5? No.\n> \n> \"Disappears after N turns\" — meaning, it will be present for N turns from now? Not clear.\n> \n> Countdown decreases every turn, including current.\n> \n> At turn t, if food has life_span L, at turn t, the countdown is L. After the turn, if not eaten, countdown decreases by 1. When countdown reaches 0, it disappears.\n> \n> For example, at turn t, life_span L, it can be eaten on turn t, and countdown decreases each turn until 0.\n> \n> So for food at (5,5), life span 5 at turn 5. After turn 5, if not eaten, life span becomes 4. It will disappear after turn 5 + 5 = turn 10? But after turn 5, life span 4, meaning it has 4 turns left including turn 6? Better to think of remaining turns.\n> \n> After turn t, if not eaten, life_span decreases by 1. So at start of turn t, life_span is the number of turns it will remain, including turn t.\n> \n> At turn t=5, food with life_span 5: it can be eaten on turn 5, and if not, on turn 6 it will have life_span 4, and so on, until life_span 0, it disappears before the next turn or after?\n> \n> \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" — so during turn t, the food is present with countdown L. After the turn, if not eaten, countdown becomes L-1 for the next turn.\n> \n> When countdown reaches 0, it disappears before the next turn, I assume.\n> \n> But for eating, as long as it's present during the turn, it can be eaten.\n> \n> For (5,5) at turn 5, life span 5, so it can be eaten on turn 5,6,7,8,9, and disappears after turn 9 or before turn 10? After turn 9, countdown would be 0, so gone.\n> \n> Similarly, other food.\n> \n> Back to decision.\n> \n> If I move U to (5,5), I eat the food there. Since it's positive food, snake length increases by 1, so after eating, snake becomes [(5,5), (5,4), (5,3)]? When head moves to food, it eats and grows, so positions: new head at (5,5), and body includes the previous head and tail, so snake positions after eating: head (5,5), then previous head (5,4), then tail (5,3). But since it grows, the tail doesn't move, so positions are [(5,5), (5,4), (5,3)].\n> \n> Then direction would be U, since I moved up.\n> \n> If I don't eat, and move elsewhere.\n> \n> But here, moving U directly eats the food at (5,5).\n> \n> Is there any danger? Tail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail has food, but here, tail is at (5,3), head at (5,5) after move, not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing an edge, so (5,5) and (5,3) are not adjacent, since y differs by 2.\n> \n> So no issue.\n> \n> Then, after eating, snake is longer, which might be riskier, but currently short.\n> \n> If I move R to (6,4), no food there, so snake moves to (6,4), and tail moves to (5,4)? Positions: head to (6,4), body was (5,4), but tail (5,3) moves to where head was? Standard snake movement.\n> \n> When moving without eating, head moves to new position, each segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, so tail moves away.\n> \n> So if I move R to (6,4), new positions: head (6,4), body (5,4) — since previous head was (5,4), now it's the body, and tail was (5,3), but since no growth, tail moves off, so new snake: [(6,4), (5,4)] — only two segments, tail at (5,4).\n> \n> Original: positions [(5,4), (5,3)] head and body.\n> \n> After move to (6,4), head is (6,4), and the body segment moves to where head was, (5,4), and since only one body segment, tail was (5,3), but it moves forward, so the segment that was at (5,3) is no longer part of snake? Positions: the list is head first, then body segments.\n> \n> Before move: segment 0: head (5,4), segment 1: body (5,3)\n> \n> After move R to (6,4): new head at (6,4), then the previous head becomes body, so segment 0: (6,4), segment 1: (5,4) — and the previous body (5,3) is no longer part of snake; it moved away.\n> \n> So snake now [(6,4), (5,4)].\n> \n> Direction: since I moved right, new head direction R.\n> \n> Now, I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n> \n> Also, food locations: (1,1) life 5, (5,5) life 5, (3,5) life 6, (6,2) life 9.\n> \n> At turn 5, life spans: (1,1):5, (5,5):5, (3,5):6, (6,2):9.\n> \n> After each turn, if not eaten, life span decreases.\n> \n> I need to plan a sequence of actions for several turns.\n> \n> But the answer should include action sequence starting from turn 5.\n> \n> And think 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> First, let's list all possible paths.\n> \n> Since snake is short, I can go for food.\n> \n> But prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> Let me sketch the grid mentally.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n> \n> Walls at borders and internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4)\n> \n> (1,4) and (1,5) are obstacles, and (1,2) obstacle.\n> \n> Food at (1,1), (5,5), (3,5), (6,2)\n> \n> Snake at (5,4) head, (5,3) body.\n> \n> From here, I can go U to (5,5) or R to (6,4).\n> \n> If I go U to (5,5), I eat food, snake grows to length 3: positions [(5,5), (5,4), (5,3)]\n> \n> Then from there, possible moves.\n> \n> Head at (5,5), direction U.\n> \n> Possible moves: U to (5,6) — y=6 is border? y=6 is not wall, y=7 is wall, so y=6 is free?

And the tail is at (5,5), but (5,5) was previously occupied, but now it's the tail.\n> \n> Length is 4, since no growth or reduction.\n> \n> Initially after growth, length 4. After moving without eating, length remains 4, but the snake moves, so the tail cell changes.\n> \n> In this case, from [(3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4)] move head to (3,4), no food, so new head (3,4), then the body: the segment that was behind head, at (4,5), moves to (3,5), the next at (5,5) moves to (4,5), the tail at (5,4) moves to (5,5).

It's turn 7, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid is from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are the borders, so I can't go to x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7. Also, there are internal obstacles at (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4). I should list all obstacles to avoid.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (4,5), then body at (5,5), and tail at (5,4). So the snake is three segments long. Head direction is L, which means it was moving left last turn, so from (5,5) to (4,5)? Positions are given as [(4,5), (5,5), (5,4)], with head first. So head is at (4,5), and it came from (5,5) since direction is L (left), so previous position was (5,5), now at (4,5).\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (1,1) with value 1, life span 3 (so disappears after turn 7 + 3 - 1? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 7, life span 3 means it has 3 turns left, including this one. So after turn 7, it will have 2 left, then 1, then gone after turn 9? Let's clarify life span.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Life-span disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\" So for a food with life span L at turn t, it will disappear after t + L - 1? For example, at turn t, life span L, after turn t, L decreases to L-1, and so on, until L=0, it disappears before the next turn or after? The countdown decreases every turn including current, so at the start of turn t, if life span is L, by the end of turn t, it becomes L-1, and when L-1=0, it disappears after that turn. But since we move and eat during the turn, I think we consider the state at the beginning of the turn.\n> \n> For eating: when the head moves onto a food cell, it eats it at that turn. So for life span, if life span is 1 at turn t, it can be eaten on turn t, and then disappears; if not eaten, it disappears after turn t.\n> \n> Similarly, life span 3 at turn 7: it can be eaten on turns 7, 8, 9; after turn 9, if not eaten, it disappears.\n> \n> Turn numbers: current turn is t1=7.\n> \n> Food:\n> \n> - (1,1): value 1, life span 3 → can be eaten on turns 7,8,9\n> \n> - (3,5): value 1, life span 4 → turns 7,8,9,10\n> \n> - (6,2): value 1, life span 7 → turns 7 to 13\n> \n> - (3,2): value 1, life span 10 → turns 7 to 16\n> \n> All food have value 1, so all are positive food. No negative food here.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (4,5), direction L (left). So from (4,5), possible moves: since direction is L, I can move L (left), U (up), or D (down), but not R (right) because that would be instant reverse, which is not allowed. Rule: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\" So since last move was left, I cannot move right on this turn.\n> \n> Possible actions from (4,5):\n> \n> - Left (L): to (3,5)\n> \n> - Up (U): to (4,6)\n> \n> - Down (D): to (4,4)\n> \n> Right (R) to (5,5) is not allowed because it's opposite to left.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score, prioritize survival.\n> \n> First, let's map the grid to visualize.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.

Also, not an obstacle. (4,6) is not in obstacles list. Obstacles are (5,2),(4,4),(1,2),(1,5),(1,4), so (4,6) is free. No food there.\n> \n> - D to (4,4): but (4,4) is an obstacle!

Moving down initially avoids the left-side obstacles and positions the snake efficiently for the route to (6,2).\n",

It's turn 9, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since the borders are from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7. Walls include the borders and internal obstacles at (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), and (1,4).\n> \n> The snake positions are: head at (3,4), then (3,5), (4,5), (5,5). So the snake has 4 segments. Head direction is down, which is D, meaning it was moving down to (3,4) from (3,5)? Let's see: positions are listed as [(3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5)]. Since head is first, at (3,4), and it was moving down, so from previous position. Head direction D means it moved down to the current position. So, before moving, head was at (3,5), and it moved down to (3,4). Positions: index 0 is head: (3,4), then body: (3,5), (4,5), (5,5). Since head direction is D, it came from (3,5) to (3,4), so (3,5) is the neck.\n> \n> Now, food:\n> \n> - (1,1) with value 1, life span 1. Life span 1 means it disappears after this turn or next? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 9, life span 1, it will disappear after turn 9? Let's clarify.\n> \n> Life span: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So for food at (1,1), life span 1 at turn 9. After turn 9, countdown decreases to 0, so it disappears after turn 9, meaning it's only available on turn 9, and gone by turn 10.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,2) with value 1, life span 5. At turn 9, life span 5, so it will last until turn 13? Countdown: starts at 5 on turn 9, decreases each turn, so after turn 9 it becomes 4, after turn 10 it becomes 3, and so on, until after turn 13 it becomes 0 and disappears. So available from turn 9 to 13 inclusive? Let's think: at turn t, life span L, it will be there until turn t + L - 1, and disappears at turn t + L.\n> \n> \"Disappears after N turns\" – after N turns from now. So if life span N, it disappears after N turns, meaning on turn t + N it is gone.\n> \n> \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" – so at turn t, countdown is N. After turn t, it becomes N-1, and so on, until countdown 0, then it disappears. So when countdown reaches 0, it disappears at the end of that turn.\n> \n> For (1,1): life span 1 at turn 9. After turn 9, countdown decreases to 0, so it disappears at the end of turn 9. That means on turn 9, it is present, but if not eaten on turn 9, it's gone forever.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,2): life span 5 at turn 9, so after turn 9, countdown=4; after turn 10, countdown=3; ... after turn 13, countdown=0, disappears. So available from turn 9 to 13 inclusive.\n> \n> Turn 9: countdown=5, present; turn 10: countdown=4, present; ... turn 13: countdown=1? Let's index:\n> \n> - Start of turn 9: countdown = 5, food present\n> \n> - End of turn 9: countdown decreases to 4, still present\n> \n> - Start of turn 10: countdown=4\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - Start of turn 13: countdown=1\n> \n> - End of turn 13: countdown decreases to 0, disappears\n> \n> So food is available to be eaten on turns when countdown > 0. On turn when countdown=1, after eaten or not, it decreases to 0 and disappears.\n> \n> For (1,1): at turn 9, countdown=1, so if not eaten on turn 9, it disappears after turn 9.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,2) with value 1, life span 8 at turn 9, so countdown=8, will last until after turn 16 or something. Life span 8, so from turn 9 to 16? Turn 9: countdown=8; turn 10:7; ... turn 16: countdown=1; turn 17: countdown=0, disappears. So available turns 9 to 16.\n> \n> All food has value 1, positive food, since value=1, and no negative food mentioned. Food positions: (1,1,1,1) – I think this means (x,y,value,life_span), so (1,1), value=1, life_span=1; (6,2,5,1) – (6,2), value=1? It says value and life span, but in the list it's (x,y,value,life_span) I assume. Let's see the input: \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span: - (1, 1, 1, 1)\" so (x,y,value,life_span) = (1,1,1,1), similarly (6,2,5,1) – that must be (x,y,value,life_span) = (6,2,1,5)? No, it says \"value and life span\", but in the tuple, it's four numbers: (1,1,1,1) and (6,2,5,1) and (3,2,8,1). I think it's (x,y, value, life_span). For (1,1,1,1): x=1,y=1,value=1,life_span=1. (6,2,5,1): x=6,y=2,value=5? But earlier it says all food is positive or negative, but here value=5 for (6,2)? That can't be right; the core rules say positive food +1, negative -1. Let's check the input.\n> \n> \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value: - (1, 1, 1, 1)\" – it says \"Life Span and Value\", but in the tuple, it's listed as (x,y, value, life_span) I think. For (1,1,1,1), it could be x,y,value,life or x,y,life,value? The text says \"Value and Life Span\" but in the list it's written as (x,y, num1, num2). In the core rules, it's \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span\", so probably (x,y, value, life_span).\n> \n> But for (6,2,5,1), if value=5, that contradicts the core rules where food is +1 or -1. Core rules: \"Positive Food Reward Value = +1\", \"Negative Food Penalty Value = -1\". Here, (6,2,5,1) has value 5? That might be a mistake, or perhaps value is the reward, but core rules say it should be +1 or -1. Similarly, (1,1,1,1) value=1, (3,2,8,1) value=8? That can't be.\n> \n> Look back at the state input: \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span: - ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 )\" but in the text, it's written as (1,1,1,1) which might be shorthand for ((1,1),1,1), but it's listed as a tuple of four numbers. I think it's a formatting issue; it should be ((x,y), value, life_span), so for (1,1,1,1), it's ((1,1),1,1), meaning x=1,y=1, value=1, life_span=1. Similarly, (6,2,5,1) is ((6,2),5,1)? Value=5, but core rules say value should be +1 or -1 for food. Perhaps it's a typo, or maybe in this case, the value is given, but core rules specify +1 or -1, so I think it's an error.\n> \n> Check the core rules: \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span: - ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 )\" and in the state, it's listed as (1,1,1,1) which might mean (x,y) = (1,1), value=1, life_span=1, but it's written without parentheses for the coordinate. Similarly, (6,2,5,1) likely means (x,y)=(6,2), value=5, life_span=1? But value=5 is not consistent with core rules.\n> \n> Perhaps the value is the reward, and in this case, it's given as 5, so it's +5, which is unusual, but I have to go with the state. Similarly, (3,2,8,1) value=8? That seems odd. Let's read the state carefully.\n> \n> \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value: - (1, 1, 1, 1) - (6, 2, 5, 1) - (3, 2, 8, 1)\"\n> \n> And it says \"Life Span and Value\" but in the core rules it's \"Value and Life Span\". I think it's a bit messy, but from the context, for (1,1,1,1), it must be x=1,y=1, value=1, life_span=1. For (6,2,5,1), if value is second, it should be value=5, life_span=1. But core rules say food value is +1 or -1, so this might be a special case or an error. Perhaps the numbers are in different order.\n> \n> Another possibility: \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value\" might mean the tuple is (x,y, life_span, value), so for (1,1,1,1), x=1,y=1, life_span=1, value=1; for (6,2,5,1), x=6,y=2, life_span=5, value=1; for (3,2,8,1), x=3,y=2, life_span=8, value=1. That makes sense because life_span is 5 for (6,2) and 8 for (3,2), and all value=1, which matches core rules.\n> \n> Yes, that must be it. Because in the first one, (1,1,1,1) with life_span=1, value=1; (6,2,5,1) life_span=5, value=1; (3,2,8,1) life_span=8, value=1. Phew, okay, all positive food with value +1.\n> \n> So food:\n> \n> - (1,1): value +1, life_span 1, so available only on turn 9 (disappears after turn 9)\n> \n> - (6,2): value +1, life_span 5, available turns 9 to 13\n> \n> - (3,2): value +1, life_span 8, available turns 9 to 16\n> \n> Now, snake positions: head at (3,4), body: (3,5), (4,5), (5,5). Head direction D, so it just moved down to (3,4) from (3,5).\n> \n> Walls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4). (1,4) and (1,5) are obstacles, but snake body is at (3,5) and (4,5), etc., so not there.\n> \n> (1,4) and (1,5) are obstacles, so cell (1,4) and (1,5) are walls, not accessible.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan actions for turn 9 and beyond, thinking 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> First, let's map the grid. Grid size 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7). Walls: all border cells, so x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls.

When snake moves, if not eating, tail moves off, so positions: if move to (3,3), new positions: head (3,3), body (3,4), (3,5), (4,5). Tail (5,5) is left, so snake shortens? No.\n> \n> Standard snake: when moving, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to previous position, so tail is removed if not eating.\n> \n> If not eating food, snake moves, head to new position, each body segment to previous position, so the last tail cell is vacated.\n> \n> If eating, head to food, new segment added at tail, so tail stays, length increases.\n> \n> Here, from positions [(3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5)]\n> \n> If move to (3,3) without eating, new positions: head (3,3), then (3,4), (3,5), (4,5). Tail (5,5) is removed, so body segments: (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), with head (3,3), so length still 4? Positions: after move, head at new, then the previous positions except tail is removed if not eating.\n> \n> Initial: segments: index 0: head (3,4), 1: (3,5), 2: (4,5), 3: tail (5,5)\n> \n> After move to new cell, say (3,3), not eating: new head (3,3), segment 0 becomes body at (3,4), segment 1 at (3,5), segment 2 at (4,5), and segment 3 (tail) is removed. So new positions: [(3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)]? No: the body segments move to the previous position of the segment before it.\n> \n> Better to think: the new head is at the new position. Then each subsequent segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> So from [head: (3,4), seg1: (3,5), seg2: (4,5), tail: (5,5)]\n> \n> Move head to (3,3): new positions: head (3,3), seg1 moves to old head position (3,4), seg2 moves to old seg1 position (3,5), tail moves to old seg2 position (4,5). And old tail (5,5) is vacated.\n> \n> So new snake: [(3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)]\n> \n> Similarly, if move left to (2,4): head (2,4), then (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)\n> \n> Now, food at (3,2): if we move to (3,3), we are closer to (3,2).

D to (3,2) is possible, and (3,2) is food. L to (2,3), R to (4,3).\n> \n> (4,3) is not wall, I think. Walls: borders and internal obstacles. (4,3) not listed, so ok.\n> \n> If we move D to (3,3) on turn 9, then on turn 10, we can move D to (3,2) to eat the food there.\n> \n> (3,2) is food, so eating it would increase length.\n> \n> But there's a risk: \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> First, on turn 9, if we move to (3,3), no food there, so no eat, snake moves, positions become [(3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)] as above.\n> \n> Tail is at (4,5).\n> \n> Now, (3,2) is food, at (3,2).\n> \n> On turn 10, from (3,3), move D to (3,2). Since (3,2) is food, we eat it, so head moves to (3,2), and a new segment is added, so tail doesn't move. New positions: head (3,2), then (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5). Length 5 now.\n> \n> Is there any danger? Tail is at (4,5), head at (3,2), not adjacent.\n> \n> Now, what about the other move: on turn 9, move left to (2,4).\n> \n> Then positions: head (2,4), then (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)\n> \n> From (2,4), possible moves: since we moved left, direction L, so cannot reverse to R.\n> \n> Moves: U, D, L, R but R is reverse, invalid.

It's turn 10, and the grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think? Let me confirm: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? Walls are at x=0 and x=7, so x=1 to x=6 are inside, similarly y=1 to y=6. But let's check the coordinates given.\n> \n> Internal obstacles are at (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4). So cells that are blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (3,3), then (3,4), (3,5), (4,5). So the snake has 4 segments. Head is at (3,3) and direction is D, which is down. So moving down means increasing y? In coordinates, usually y increases up or down? The movement: U is (x,y+1), so y+1 is up, I assume? Let's see the definition.\n> \n> U: (x,y+1) – that means if y increases, it's upward if we think of (0,0) as bottom-left. But in grid terms, often (0,0) is top-left, so U would decrease y? I need to clarify.\n> \n> The movement definitions: U (x,y+1), D (x,y-1), L (x-1,y), R (x+1,y). And walls at y=0 and y=7, with y=0 being bottom or top? It doesn't specify, but since D is y-1, that probably means decreasing y is down, so y=0 is the bottom row, y=7 is top? But walls are at y=0 and y=7, so if y=0 is bottom, moving down to y-1 could go to y=0 which is wall.\n> \n> Similarly, x=0 left, x=7 right.\n> \n> In the playable area, x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? Let's see: walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. Therefore, valid cells are x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6. Yes.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4). So these are also blocked.\n> \n> Snake: head at (3,3), body at (3,4), (3,5), (4,5). Direction is D, down, so from (3,3), moving down would be to (3,2), since D: (x,y-1).\n> \n> But y-1 from (3,3) is (3,2). Is (3,2) valid? Let's check if it's wall or obstacle.\n> \n> Walls: border x=0,7 y=0,7, so (3,2) is x=3 between 1-6, y=2 between 1-6, so not border wall. Internal obstacles: (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (5,2), (4,4). (3,2) is not in that list, so it should be free, but there might be food or something.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (6,2,5,1) – this is (x,y, life_span, value) I think. Format: ( (x,y), value, life_span ) but here it's given as (6,2,5,1) so probably (x,y, life_span, value)? Let's see: \" (6, 2, 5, 1) \" and it says Food Positions, Value and Life Span: so it might be (x,y, life_span, value) or (x,y, value, life_span)? The description says: \" ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 ) \" but in input it's written as (6,2,5,1) which is ambiguous.\n> \n> Look: \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value: - (6, 2, 5, 1) - (3, 2, 7, 1) - (1, 3, 10, 1)\"\n> \n> But it says \"Value and Life Span\" in the core rules, and here it says \"Life Span and Value\" but the order might be different. In the input, it's listed with numbers, so for (6,2,5,1), it could be x=6,y=2, life_span=5, value=1? Or value=5, life_span=1? I think I need to parse.\n> \n> In the core rules, it says: \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span: - ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 )\" but in the state input, it's written as points with three numbers: (x,y, life_span, value) or what? Let's read carefully.\n> \n> State Input Format: \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value: - (6, 2, 5, 1)\" – it says \"Life Span and Value\" here, but in core rules it was \"Value and Life Span\". Probably the numbers are (x,y, life_span, value) or (x,y, value, life_span)? I think it's (x,y, life_span, value) because for (6,2,5,1) value=1, and for (3,2,7,1) value=1, and (1,3,10,1) value=1, so all value=1, positive food. So it's (x,y, life_span, value). Life_span is 5,7,10 respectively, value all +1.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,2,7,1) means x=3,y=2, life_span=7, value=1.\n> \n> (1,3,10,1) x=1,y=3, life_span=10, value=1.\n> \n> And (6,2,5,1) x=6,y=2, life_span=5, value=1.\n> \n> All are positive food, no negative food here.\n> \n> Life_span decreases each turn, including current turn. So at turn t=10, for (6,2), life_span=5, so it will disappear after 5 turns, meaning it will be gone on turn 11? Life_span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 10, it has 5 turns left, so it disappears when life_span reaches 0, which is after 5 decreases, so on turn 15 it might be gone? Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So at a given turn, life_span is the number of turns it will stay, including the current turn. So for food at turn t with life_span L, it will be there for turns t, t+1, ..., t+L-1, and disappear at turn t+L.\n> \n> For example, at turn 10, (6,2) has life_span=5, so it will be present on turns 10,11,12,13,14, and disappear on turn 15.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,2) life_span=7, present from turn 10 to 16, disappear turn 17.\n> \n> (1,3) life_span=10, present from turn 10 to 19, disappear turn 20.\n> \n> Now snake: positions [(3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)] so head at (3,3), then (3,4), (3,5), tail at (4,5).

(3,2) has food, but (3,2) is not occupied by snake; snake head is at (3,3), body at (3,4), etc. (3,2) is below head.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,3) is left, (6,2) is right-bottom.\n> \n> So no food under snake body currently.\n> \n> Now, back to possible moves from (3,3):\n> \n> - D to (3,2): this cell has food!

So moving to (3,2) should be fine, and since there is food, we eat it, snake grows to length 5.\n> \n> But we need to think ahead, 5+ turns.\n> \n> Also, there is a rule about tail reward danger: \"If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n> \n> In this case, tail is at (4,5), head at (3,3), are they adjacent? Adjacent means sharing an edge, so (3,3) and (4,5): dx=1, dy=2, not adjacent; adjacent would be same x or y, diff 1, like (3,3) and (3,4) or (4,3), etc. (3,3) and (4,5) are not adjacent; distance is sqrt(2), not adjacent. So no issue here.\n> \n> Now, if we move D to (3,2), we eat the food, snake becomes: new head at (3,2), then previous head (3,3) becomes body, and so on, tail was (4,5), but since we ate food, tail doesn't move, so snake grows: positions [(3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)] after move.\n> \n> Original: head (3,3), body (3,4), (3,5), tail (4,5)\n> \n> After moving D to (3,2) and eating food: new head (3,2), then the previous positions: (3,3) still part, (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), and since we ate, we add a segment, so tail stays, so snake is now [(3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)] with 5 segments.\n> \n> Tail is at (4,5).\n> \n> Now, we need to plan a sequence of actions for multiple turns.\n> \n> The answer should include action sequence for turn t1=10, t1+1, etc., up to say 5 turns or more? It says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but the sequence can be for several turns.\n> \n> Also, maximize score, but prioritize survival.\n> \n> Now, let's look at the food: there is food at (3,2), which is directly below, and we can eat it now by moving D.\n> \n> But is it safe? (3,2) is not occupied, no collision risk.\n> \n> However, after eating, snake is longer, which might make it harder to maneuver.\n> \n> There is also food at (6,2) and (1,3).\n> \n> (6,2) has life_span 5, so only 5 turns left, including turn 10, so it will disappear after turn 14.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,2) has life_span 7, so until turn 16, (1,3) until turn 19.\n> \n> But (3,2) is very close, we can eat it now.\n> \n> But let's think about the grid and obstacles.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4)\n> \n> (1,2) is obstacle, (1,4), (1,5) also, so the left column x=1 has obstacles at y=2,4,5, so only y=1,3,6 might be free? But y=6 is top, since y=7 wall, y=1 bottom? Let's define coordinates.\n> \n> Assume (1,1) is bottom-left? But in movement, U is y+1, so probably y increases upward, so (1,1) bottom-left, (1,6) top-left, (6,6) top-right, etc.\n> \n> Walls at y=0 and y=7, so y=0 is below row 1, y=7 above row 6.\n> \n> Similarly x.\n> \n> So cells: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n> \n> Obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4)\n> \n> So at x=1, y=2,4,5 are obstacles, so free at x=1: y=1,3,6.\n> \n> y=1,3,6 are free for x=1.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,2) obstacle, so at x=5, y=2 blocked.\n> \n> (4,4) blocked.\n> \n> Now, back to snake: if we move D to (3,2), we eat food, snake grows, head at (3,2), direction was D, but after move, direction is D, so for next turn, we can move L, R, D, not U.\n> \n> From (3,2), possible moves:\n> \n> - D: (3,1) but y=1, and walls are at y=0, so y=1 is not wall, it's playable. y=0 is wall, y=1 is bottom row, valid.\n> \n> - L: (2,2)\n> \n> - R: (4,2)\n> \n> But (4,2) : is it free?

When we move head to (4,2), the body moves: tail was at (4,5), and since we didn't eat, tail moves away.\n> \n> Let's simulate turn by turn.\n> \n> Turn 10: current head (3,3), direction D.\n> \n> Option: move D to (3,2), eat food, snake grows to 5 segments: new positions head (3,2), body (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)\n> \n> Now turn 11: head at (3,2), direction is now D (since we moved down).\n> \n> Possible moves: D to (3,1), L to (2,2), R to (4,2)\n> \n> U is opposite, cannot.\n> \n> Now, (3,1): y=1, not wall, no obstacle, no food (food at (6,2), (1,3), (3,2) eaten), so (3,1) empty.\n> \n> (2,2) empty.\n> \n> (4,2) empty.\n> \n> Say we move R to (4,2) to go towards (6,2).\n> \n> Turn 11: move R to (4,2)\n> \n> Now head to (4,2), no food, so snake moves: head (4,2), then (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), and tail (4,5) moves away, so positions: [(4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5)]? Original body: after turn 10, snake is [(3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)]\n> \n> When we move head to new position, the body follows: new head at (4,2), then the previous head (3,2) becomes neck, then (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), and tail (4,5) is removed since no growth, so new positions: [(4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)] and (3,5) is no longer part, but (3,5) was the second last, let's index.\n> \n> After turn 10: segments: 0: head (3,2), 1: (3,3), 2: (3,4), 3: (3,5), 4: tail (4,5)\n> \n> Turn 11: move head to (4,2), no food, so new head (4,2), then segment 0 becomes (3,2), segment 1 becomes (3,3), segment 2 becomes (3,4), segment 3 becomes (3,5), and tail segment 4 is removed, so snake is [(4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)] and (3,5) is gone? No.\n> \n> The body segments shift: the head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> So from positions: head P0 = (3,2), P1 = (3,3), P2 = (3,4), P3 = (3,5), P4 = (4,5)\n> \n> After moving head to new position Q, new P0 = Q, new P1 = old P0, new P2 = old P1, new P3 = old P2, new P4 = old P3 if no growth, but since no growth, the last segment is removed, so new snake has one less segment?

Let's list:\n> \n> New head: (4,2)\n> \n> Then the first body segment is the previous head position: (3,2)\n> \n> Then next body segment is previous S1: (3,3)\n> \n> Then previous S2: (3,4)\n> \n> Then previous S3: (3,5)  // this is the new tail\n> \n> Previous S4 (4,5) is no longer part of snake.\n> \n> So snake positions: [(4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5)] with head at (4,2), tail at (3,5).\n> \n> But (3,5) was previously occupied, and now it's tail.\n> \n> From (4,2), we can move to eat (6,2).\n> \n> (6,2) is at x=6,y=2.\n> \n> From (4,2), possible moves: U (4,3), D (4,1), L (3,2), R (5,2)\n> \n> But (5,2) is obstacle, so cannot move R.\n> \n> L to (3,2) is body segment, currently occupied by S1, which is not tail, so if we move to (3,2), it's collision with body.\n> \n> Positions: head at (4,2), body at (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5)\n> \n> So (3,2) is occupied, so moving L to (3,2) would collide with body.\n> \n> Similarly, U to (4,3) or D to (4,1).\n> \n> (4,3) is free, no food.\n> \n> (4,1) free.\n> \n> So from (4,2), we can move U to (4,3) or D to (4,1), not L or R directly to (5,2) impossible.\n> \n> R to (5,2) is obstacle, so only U or D.\n> \n> Say we move U to (4,3).\n> \n> Turn 11: from (4,2) move U to (4,3)\n> \n> No food at (4,3), so snake moves: new head (4,3), then body: (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4) and tail (3,5) removed, so new snake: [(4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)]? Length 5, but after turn 11 move, no growth, so length should be 4? I think I confused the length.\n> \n> At turn 10 after eating, length 5.\n> \n> Turn 11: move to (4,2), no food, so length remains 5? No, when we eat, length increases, when we don't eat, length stays the same, but the tail moves, so the number of segments is constant when no food.\n> \n> General rule: when head moves to a cell with food, snake grows, length +1, tail stays.\n> \n> When head moves to empty cell, no growth, tail moves forward, so length same.\n> \n> In this case, at turn 10, we ate food, so length became 5.\n> \n> At turn 11, we moved to (4,2) no food, so no growth, tail moves, so length still 5, but positions shift.\n> \n> After turn 11 move to (4,2): new head (4,2), then the segments are: position of previous head (3,2), previous S1 (3,3), previous S2 (3,4), previous S3 (3,5), and previous S4 (4,5) is removed, but since no growth, the last segment is not added, so the snake has segments from new head to previous S3, so only 4 segments? Let's think.\n> \n> Initial positions before move: P0, P1, P2, P3, P4\n> \n> After moving head to Q:\n> \n> - If no food, new P0 = Q, new P1 = old P0, new P2 = old P1, new P3 = old P2, new P4 = old P3, and old P4 is vacated.

It's turn 11. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7). Internal obstacles at (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4). Snake positions: head at (3,2), then body at (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5). So the snake is 5 units long. Head direction is down, which is D, meaning moving towards decreasing y, so from (3,3) to (3,2) since head is at (3,2) and previous was (3,3), y decreased from 3 to 2, so direction D makes sense.\n> \n> Food: two items:\n> \n> - (6,2) with value 1 and life span 4\n> \n> - (1,3) with value 1 and life span 9\n> \n> Both are positive food since value is +1.\n> \n> Life span means how many turns until they disappear, including the current turn. So for (6,2), life span 4 at turn 11, so it will disappear after 4 turns, meaning it will be gone by turn 15. Similarly, (1,3) with life span 9 will be around until turn 20.\n> \n> I need to plan an action sequence for at least 5 turns ahead, starting from turn 11.\n> \n> Available moves: I can go U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), L (left, x-1), R (right, x+1). But I can't instantly reverse direction. Since head is moving D (down), I can't go U (up) next because that would be reverse. So possible moves from (3,2) are D, L, R, but not U.\n> \n> Current position: (3,2)\n> \n> Possible moves:\n> \n> - U: to (3,3) but (3,3) is occupied by the body, so that would be collision, deadly. Also, since direction is D, U is reverse, which is not allowed anyway.\n> \n> - D: to (3,1) but y=0 is wall, so (3,1) is y=1? Let's see grid: y=0 is wall, so y=1 is the bottom row? Coordinates: walls at y=0 and y=7, so y=0 is bottom, y=7 top? Typically in grids, y=0 might be bottom or top, but here it says \"y=0/y=7\" for borders, and snake at (3,2), (3,3), etc., with head at (3,2) moving down to decreasing y, so if y=0 is wall, then y=1 is above y=0? I need to clarify the coordinate system.\n> \n> It says: \"Border Cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7.\" And internal obstacles given. Also, snake positions: head (3,2), then (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5). Since head direction is D, and it moved from (3,3) to (3,2), so y decreased, so lower y values are downward.\n> \n> y=0 is wall, so (3,1) would be at y=1, which is one above y=0 wall? Let's list possible cells.\n> \n> The grid goes from x=0 to x=7, y=0 to y=7. Walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, meaning these coordinates are inaccessible.\n> \n> So for example, (3,2) is valid, (3,1) is also valid since y=1 is not wall, only y=0 is wall. y=0 is the border, so cells with y=0 or x=0 etc. are walls, so we can only be on x=1 to x=6? No.\n> \n> x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x from 1 to 6 are free? But snake is at (3,2) to (4,5), all within 1 to 6? x=3, y=2, etc. x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y from 1 to 6?

When life span becomes 0 after decrease, it disappears.\n> \n> For example, food with life span 4 at turn 11:\n> \n> - Turn 11: present, after turn, life span 3\n> \n> - Turn 12: present, after turn, life span 2\n> \n> - Turn 13: present, after turn, life span 1\n> \n> - Turn 14: present, after turn, life span 0, disappears\n> \n> - Turn 15: not present\n> \n> Similarly, for (1,3) life span 9 at turn 11, it will be around until turn 19 or so.\n> \n> Now, (6,2) is at x=6,y=2. From head at (3,2), same y, different x.\n> \n> (1,3) at x=1,y=3.\n> \n> Also, I need to avoid risks, like moving into body or walls.\n> \n> Now, the snake body: after moving, the tail moves, so when the snake moves, the head goes to a new cell, and if not eating, tail is removed; if eating, tail stays and length increases.\n> \n> But for collision, when head moves to a cell, if that cell is body except the tail, it collides. But if it's the tail, and tail moves away, it's ok, but only if the tail is moving away, meaning that after move, head is where tail was, but tail has moved.\n> \n> Standard snake rules: when head moves to a cell, if that cell is occupied by body except the current tail, it dies. But if it moves to the current tail position, and tail moves away at the same time, it's safe, because tail leaves as head arrives.\n> \n> But there's a special case: \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> In this case, tail is at (4,5). Head at (3,2), not adjacent.\n> \n> Adjacent cells to head: (3,2) has neighbors (3,1), (3,3), (2,2), (4,2)\n> \n> (3,3) is body, (3,1), (2,2), (4,2) are possible moves.\n> \n> Tail is at (4,5), which is not adjacent to head, so no issue now.\n> \n> First, I need to get to food.\n> \n> (6,2) is at (6,2), which is close to head at (3,2), same row, distance 3 in x.\n> \n> (1,3) is at (1,3), which is left and up a bit.\n> \n> But there are obstacles: (1,2) is obstacle, (1,4), (1,5) obstacles, so around (1,3) it might be tight.\n> \n> (1,3) is food, and (1,2), (1,4), (1,5) are obstacles, so (1,3) might be accessible only from left or right, but x=1, and x=0 is wall, so from (2,3) or something.\n> \n> x=1 is not wall, walls are x=0, so x=1 is free except for obstacles.\n> \n> (1,3) is not an obstacle, it's food, but adjacent cells: (1,2) obstacle, (1,4) obstacle, (0,3) wall, (2,3) might be free? (2,3) not listed as obstacle or wall.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,1) or (1,6), but y=3.\n> \n> To reach (1,3), possible from (2,3) or (1,4) but (1,4) obstacle, or (1,2) obstacle, so only from (2,3) or (0,3) but wall, so only from (2,3).\n> \n> (1,3) can be accessed from (1,4) but (1,4) is obstacle, not accessible. From (1,2) obstacle. From below (1,1) or above (1,5) but (1,5) obstacle. So only from left or right: left is (0,3) wall, not accessible; right is (2,3). So (1,3) can only be accessed from (2,3), since (1,4) and (1,2) are blocked.\n> \n> (1,3) has neighbors:\n> \n> - Up: (1,4) — obstacle\n> \n> - Down: (1,2) — obstacle\n> \n> - Left: (0,3) — wall\n> \n> - Right: (2,3)\n> \n> So yes, only accessible from (2,3).\n> \n> Similarly, (6,2) at (6,2): neighbors\n> \n> - Left: (5,2) — obstacle! (5,2) is internal obstacle\n> \n> - Right: (7,2) — x=7 wall\n> \n> - Up: (6,3)\n> \n> - Down: (6,1)\n> \n> So (6,2) can be accessed from (6,3), (6,1), or (5,2) but (5,2) obstacle, not accessible. So only from (6,3) or (6,1).\n> \n> Now back to head at (3,2).\n> \n> I need to plan a sequence of moves.\n> \n> First, let's list the snake positions: head (3,2), then (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), tail (4,5)\n> \n> If I move, the tail will move only if I don't eat food.\n> \n> Now, food at (6,2) and (1,3).\n> \n> (6,2) is closer in terms of steps, but has short life, only 4 turns, so I need to eat it soon or it disappears.\n> \n> (1,3) has longer life, 9 turns.\n> \n> But to reach (6,2), from (3,2), I can go right to (4,2), then to (5,2) but (5,2) is obstacle, so I cannot go to (5,2).\n> \n> From (4,2), I can go up to (4,3) or down to (4,1), or left to (3,2) but that might be body, or right to (5,2) obstacle.\n> \n> But to reach (6,2), since (5,2) is blocked, I need to go around.\n> \n> For example, from (3,2) go R to (4,2), then from (4,2) I can go U to (4,3) or D to (4,1).\n> \n> Then from (4,3), I can go to (5,3) or (4,4) but (4,4) is obstacle, so to (5,3), then to (6,3), then down to (6,2)? (6,3) to (6,2) is possible.\n> \n> Similarly, from (4,1) to (5,1) to (6,1) to (6,2).\n> \n> But (6,2) has life span 4, so I need to reach it within 4 turns, including current turn 11.\n> \n> At turn 11, I move; if I move to (6,2) on turn 11, I can eat it immediately, but from (3,2) to (6,2) is not adjacent; it's 3 cells away.\n> \n> Distance: from (3,2) to (6,2) is |6-3|=3 in x, same y, so min 3 moves if no obstacles, but (4,2) is free, (5,2) obstacle, so I cannot go directly.\n> \n> Path via (4,2) then (5,3) or something.\n> \n> Shortest path to (6,2):\n> \n> Option 1: via (4,2), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2) — 4 moves\n> \n> (3,2) to (4,2) turn 11 move R\n> \n> Then (4,2) to (5,3)? (4,2) to (5,3) is not adjacent; adjacent cells share side, so (4,2) can go to (4,3), (4,1), (3,2), (5,2) but (5,2) obstacle.\n> \n> So from (4,2), can go to (4,3) or (4,1) or back to (3,2) but body might be there later.\n> \n> To (6,2):\n> \n> - From (4,2), go U to (4,3) — turn 12\n> \n> Then from (4,3), can go to (5,3) — turn 13\n> \n> Then (5,3) to (6,3) — turn 14\n> \n> Then (6,3) to (6,2) — turn 15? But (6,2) life span: at turn 11, life 4, so turn 11,12,13,14 present, turn 15 gone. So on turn 14, I can be at (6,3), move to (6,2) on turn 14, which is within life span.\n> \n> Turn sequence:\n> \n> Turn 11: move from (3,2) to, say, R to (4,2)\n> \n> After move, snake: head (4,2), body (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5)? Tail was (4,5), but since not eating, tail moves, so new positions: after moving to (4,2), head at (4,2), then the body: previous head (3,2) becomes body, so positions: [(4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5)]? (3,5) was body, but tail was (4,5), which is removed since not eating.\n> \n> Snake positions: before move: head (3,2), body (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), tail (4,5)\n> \n> After move to (4,2) without eating: head moves to (4,2), and tail (4,5) is removed, so body becomes (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5) but (3,5) was second last, now last, but since tail removed, positions: [(4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)]?

No: the segments: new head at (4,2), then the first body segment is the previous head (3,2), then previous body segments except the last one is removed? Standard snake movement: when not eating, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous one, so the tail segment is removed.\n> \n> So positions: after move, the list is: new head position, then the previous positions from index 0 to second last.\n> \n> Initial positions: [P0, P1, P2, P3, P4] = [(3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)]\n> \n> After moving head to new position Q, not eating, new positions: [Q, P0, P1, P2, P3] = [(4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5)]\n> \n> P4 is removed.\n> \n> So now snake: head (4,2), body (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), tail (3,5)\n> \n> (3,5) is tail.\n> \n> Then turn 12: from (4,2), I can move U to (4,3) or D to (4,1) or L to (3,2) but (3,2) is body, collision, or R to (5,2) but (5,2) obstacle, so only U or D.\n> \n> Say move U to (4,3)\n> \n> Then new positions: head (4,3), body (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4) — tail (3,4)?

So I must avoid these cells.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (3,1), then (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5). So the snake is vertical, going down, with head at (3,1) and tail at (3,5). Since head direction is D (down), that makes sense; it's moving downward.\n> \n> Food: two items:\n> \n> - (6,2) with value 1 and life span 3. Life span 3 means it disappears after 3 turns, including the current turn. So on turn 12, life span 3; turn 13, it becomes 2; turn 14, it becomes 1; and on turn 15, it disappears. Since we're on turn 12, it can be eaten on turn 12, 13, or 14.\n> \n> - (1,3) with value 1 and life span 8. So it lasts until turn 12 + 8 - 1? Life span decreases every turn, including current. So if life span is N on turn T, it disappears after N turns, meaning it can be eaten until turn T + N - 1. Let's clarify:\n> \n> - On turn T, food has life span L: it can be eaten on turns T, T+1, ..., T+L-1. After turn T+L-1, it's gone.\n> \n> For (6,2): turn 12, L=3, so available on turns 12,13,14.

Possible moves: since direction is down, I can move down, left, or right, but not up (because no instant reverse). Current direction D, so I can't move U next.

(1,2), (1,4), (1,5) are obstacles, but (1,3) is not listed, so it should be free and has food.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,2): x=6,y=2. Obstacles: (5,2) is obstacle, but (6,2) is not listed as obstacle, so free with food.\n> \n> Now, head at (3,1), moving down. From (3,1), moving down would go to (3,0), but y=0 is wall, so moving down to (3,0) is invalid, collision with wall.\n> \n> y=0 is bottom wall, I assume. Typically in grids, (0,0) is bottom-left or top-left? The problem doesn't specify, but since head direction is down and positions go from (3,1) to (3,5), with head at (3,1) and tail at (3,5), and moving down, so probably y increases upwards or downwards?\n> \n> Let's clarify coordinate system.\n> \n> Snake positions: [(3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5)]. Head at (3,1), then next segment at (3,2), which is same x, higher y, so if y increases upwards, then (3,1) is below (3,2), so moving from (3,1) to (3,2) would be moving up? But head direction is D, down.\n> \n> Inconsistency.\n> \n> Head direction is D, down, and positions from head to tail: (3,1) -> (3,2) -> (3,3) -> (3,4) -> (3,5).\n> \n> If head is at (3,1) and moving down to (3,2), that means y=2 is below y=1? So y must increase downwards.\n> \n> In many systems, y increases down, like in computer graphics.\n> \n> Confirm: moving down should decrease y or increase?\n> \n> Standard: in grid, often y=0 at top, y increases down, or y=0 at bottom.\n> \n> But here, walls: y=0 and y=7 are borders.\n> \n> Snake: head (3,1), moving down to (3,2)? But (3,2) is the next segment, which is directly below if y increases down.\n> \n> Assume y increases downward. So (3,1) is above (3,2), and moving down from (3,1) to (3,2) would be moving to a lower y if y increases up, but let's see the direction.\n> \n> Head direction is D, down, and the body segment is at (3,2), so if the snake is moving down, the head was previously at a higher y, moving to lower y.\n> \n> Positions: head (3,1), then (3,2), (3,3), etc. So from head to tail, y increases: 1,2,3,4,5, so y increases downward. So (3,1) is above (3,2), which is above (3,3), and so on.\n> \n> But if moving down, it should be decreasing y? Contradiction.\n> \n> Perhaps the positions are listed with head first, so the snake was moving down, so from previous position, it was at (3,0) or something, but (3,0) is wall.\n> \n> Current positions: head at (3,1), then segments at (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5). So the head is at (3,1), and the next segment is at (3,2), which has higher y, so if y increases downward, (3,2) is below (3,1), meaning the snake is moving downward.\n> \n> Direction D means down, so from (3,1) moving down to (3,2) would be consistent if y increases downward.\n> \n> Moving down to (3,2) from (3,1)? (3,2) is already occupied by the body.\n> \n> In snake movement, when moving, the head moves to a new cell, and each segment follows the previous one.\n> \n> But in the position list, at current turn, the head is at (3,1), and it is moving down, so on the next turn, if it moves down, head goes to (3,0), but (3,0) is wall, so invalid.\n> \n> Let's read the movement: \"in each turn you can choose to move 1 cell in U, D, L, R.\"\n> \n> Current head at (3,1), direction D (down).\n> \n> Possible moves:\n> \n> - U: up, to (3,0)? y=0 is wall, so invalid.\n> \n> - D: down, to (3,2)?

After turn 12, positions: head (4,1), body (3,1), (3,2), etc. (3,1) is second segment, not tail.

Segment after head: (4,1) to where head was? Head was at (4,1), now to (5,1), so body: first segment moves to (4,1), second to (3,1), third to (3,2), tail to (3,3). Positions: (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3)\n> \n> Now turn 14: from (5,1), direction R (since moved right), possible moves: R to (6,1), U to (5,0) wall invalid, D to (5,2), but (5,2) is obstacle!

When eating, the snake grows, so the head moves to food, and a new segment is added at the end, so tail stays, but in terms of positions.\n> \n> After move to (6,2), head at (6,2), and since food eaten, length increases, so the tail remains where it was, but the body moves.\n> \n> Standard snake: when head moves to food cell, it eats, so the new head is at food, and a new segment is added, so the tail doesn't move; the body segments shift.\n> \n> For example, before move, positions: head (6,1), body (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), tail (3,2)? Positions: after turn 13 to (5,1): head (5,1), body (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3)\n> \n> Then turn 14 move to (6,1): head (6,1), body (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), tail (3,2)? (3,2) is the last, but (3,3) was tail, moved to (3,2)? After moving to (6,1): the segment that was at (5,1) moves to where head was? Head was at (5,1), now at (6,1), so first body segment moves to (5,1), second to (4,1), third to (3,1), fourth to (3,2), and tail was at (3,3), moves to (3,2)? Let's index.\n> \n> After turn 13 (after moving to (5,1)): positions: index 0: head (5,1), 1: (4,1), 2: (3,1), 3: (3,2), 4: tail (3,3)\n> \n> On turn 14, move head to (6,1). Then new positions: head (6,1), then body: segment 1 moves to (5,1), segment 2 moves to (4,1), segment 3 moves to (3,1), segment 4 (tail) moves to (3,2). So positions: (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2)\n> \n> Tail at (3,2).\n> \n> Now, from (6,1), I can move to (6,2) to eat food on turn 15?

Turn 14 is the last turn.\n> \n> On turn 14, if I move to (6,2), I eat it.\n> \n> After move: head to (6,2), which is food, so eaten, snake grows. New head at (6,2), and a new segment is added at the tail, so positions: head (6,2), body (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), and new tail at (3,2)? The tail position before move was (3,2), but since we add a segment, the tail doesn't move.\n> \n> When eating: head moves to new cell (food), the body segments move as usual, but since food is eaten, a new segment is added at the end, so the tail stays in place, and a new cell is added there.\n> \n> In terms of positions: after moving to food, the new head is at food, the previous head becomes part of body, and so on, but the last segment (tail) remains, and a new segment is added at the tail position.\n> \n> So before move to (6,2): positions (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2) with head at (6,1), tail at (3,2)\n> \n> Move head to (6,2): head to (6,2), then body: segment 1 moves to (6,1), segment 2 moves to (5,1), segment 3 moves to (4,1), segment 4 moves to (3,1), and since food eaten, add new segment at the end, so tail at (3,1)? New positions: head (6,2), then (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), and new segment at (3,2) — but (3,2) was the tail position, but it moved.\n> \n> Standard: when not eating, tail moves to the previous position of the second last segment. When eating, tail doesn't move, and we add a new segment at the current tail position before move.\n> \n> Let's think.\n> \n> Before move: positions: A (head), B, C, D, E (tail)\n> \n> After move without eating: new head at new position, then B to A, C to B, D to C, E to D, so E moves away.\n> \n> After move with eating: new head at food, then B to A, C to B, D to C, and E stays, and new segment at E, so positions: new head, A, B, C, D, E (now body), and new tail at E? E was tail, now new tail at same position? Confusing.\n> \n> Typically: when eating, the head moves to food, the body follows, so the segment that was at head moves to the new position, but the tail doesn't advance; it stays, and we add a new segment at the old tail position.\n> \n> But in movement, all segments move except that we add one.\n> \n> Easier: after moving to food, the snake length increases, so the new position list has one more element.\n> \n> Before move: positions P0 (head), P1, P2, ..., Pk (tail)\n> \n> After move to new cell N (which is food): new head at N, then P0, P1, P2, ..., Pk, so the tail is at Pk, and Pk is the new tail, but Pk was the old tail, so it doesn't move.\n> \n> In this case, before move to (6,2): positions (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2) with (6,1) head, (3,2) tail.\n> \n> Move to (6,2): new head at (6,2), then the previous positions become: (6,2) head, then (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), and since we add a segment, we keep (3,2) as the new tail? So positions: head (6,2), body (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), tail (3,2)\n> \n> Length 6 now.\n> \n> But (3,2) was the tail and remains tail, but in the list, it's the last position.\n> \n> In terms of collision, the cell (3,2) is occupied by tail.\n> \n> Back to turn 14: I can move to (6,2) from (6,1) and eat the food on turn 14.\n> \n> In this sequence, on turn 12 move R to (4,1), turn 13 move R to (5,1), turn 14 move to (6,1), then on turn 14 move to (6,2)? Turn 14 is when I move from (6,1) to (6,2).\n> \n> In the sequence, on turn 14, I am at (6,1) after the move, but the move is what I do on that turn.\n> \n> Clarify turns.\n> \n> Turn 12: I move to (4,1)\n> \n> After turn 12, positions as above.\n> \n> Turn 13: I move to (5,1)\n> \n> After turn 13, positions: head (5,1), body (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3) — earlier I had (3,3) as tail, but let's correct.\n> \n> After turn 12 move R: positions: head (4,1), body (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)\n> \n> Turn 13 move R to (5,1): head to (5,1), then body: (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), tail at (3,3)?

Segments: pos0 (6,1) head, pos1 (5,1), pos2 (4,1), pos3 (3,1), pos4 (3,2) tail.\n> \n> Move to (6,2) and eat food: head moves to (6,2), food eaten, so new head (6,2), body segments: pos1: old head (6,1), pos2: old pos1 (5,1), pos3: old pos2 (4,1), pos4: old pos3 (3,1), and since ate, add new segment at old tail position (3,2), so pos5: (3,2). New length 6.\n> \n> But (3,2) was already a position, but now it's the new tail.\n> \n> Anyway, I can eat (6,2) on turn 14 if I go to (5,1) on turn 13 and (6,1) on turn 14, then (6,2) on turn 14? On turn 14, I move from (6,1) to (6,2), that's one move.\n> \n> Turn 13: move to (5,1)\n> \n> Turn 14: move to (6,1) — at this point, after move, I am at (6,1), and food at (6,2) is still there since life span decreases after the action? I need to check the timing.\n> \n> The state is given at the beginning of turn, before action.\n> \n> At turn t, state is given, I choose action, then after action, the move happens, and then food life span decreases.\n> \n> Let's see the rules.\n> \n> \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" but it doesn't specify when exactly.\n> \n> Similarly for eating.\n> \n> Typically, in such games, at the start of turn, state is observed, player chooses action, then action is executed: head moves, if food eaten, grow, else tail moves. Then food life span decreases, and new food may spawn, but here no spawning mentioned, only existing food.\n> \n> The problem doesn't say new food spawns, so only these three foods.\n> \n> For life span: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> I think it decreases after the action is taken.\n> \n> Similarly, eating happens when head moves to food cell during the move.\n> \n> So, on turn t, I choose move, head moves to new cell, if food there, it is eaten, snake grows. Then after that, for all food, life span decreases by 1. If life span becomes 0, it disappears.\n> \n> In this case, at turn 13, food at (6,2) has life span 2.\n> \n> After I move on turn 13, if I don't eat it, life span decreases to 1.\n> \n> Then on turn 14, after move, if not eaten, decreases to 0 and disappears.\n> \n> To eat it, I need to move to (6,2) on turn 13 or turn 14.\n> \n> On turn 13, from (4,1), I can move to (5,1) or (4,2), neither is (6,2), so I cannot eat on turn 13.\n> \n> Then on turn 14, I can be at (6,2) to eat it.\n> \n> To be at (6,2) on turn 14, I need to move there from some position on turn 14.\n> \n> On turn 14, I must be at a cell adjacent to (6,2), which are (5,2), (6,3), (6,1), (7,2) but x=7 wall, so (5,2), (6,3), (6,1).\n> \n> (5,2) is obstacle, cannot move there.\n> \n> (6,3) is possible, or (6,1).\n> \n> (6,3) is within bounds, y=3, x=6.\n> \n> (6,1) as before.\n> \n> Now, to be at (6,1) on turn 14, I need to be at (5,1) or (6,2) or (6,0) or (7,1) but walls, so only from (5,1) or (6,2) or (6,0 invalid, so (5,1) or (6,2).\n> \n> But (6,2) is the food, so if I am at (6,2) on turn 14, I eat it when moving there.\n> \n> To be at (6,1) on turn 14, I must have moved from a position on turn 13.\n> \n> From turn 13 position (4,1), if I move to (5,1) on turn 13, then on turn 14 I can move to (6,1) from (5,1).\n> \n> Then from (6,1) on turn 14, I can move to (6,2) to eat.\n> \n> Similarly, I could go to (6,3) first, but (6,3) is not adjacent to head now.\n> \n> Another way: from (4,1) on turn 13, I could move U to (4,2), then on turn 14 move R to (5,2), but (5,2) is obstacle, cannot.\n> \n> Or from (4,2) move U to (4,3) or D to (4,1) but (4,1) is body or something, or L to (3,2), etc.\n> \n> But to reach (6,2) on turn 14, from (4,1) it's two moves away: min 2 moves.\n> \n> If I go to (5,1) on t13, then to (6,1) on t14, then to (6,2) on t14?

Not D.\n> \n> - Collisions: with walls, obstacles, or body parts except the tail, which is okay if I move into it because the tail moves.\n> \n> - Food under body: if food is under snake body, I can only eat it if body moves away and head moves onto it later. But looking at food positions: (1,3) and (2,3). Snake positions are (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2).

(3,4) - no obstacle mentioned, and y=4, x=3, not border, so free.\n> \n> - D to (3,2): (3,2) is tail segment. Since tail will move, it might be okay. But (3,2) is currently occupied by tail, but when I move, the tail moves only after head moves and if no food eaten.\n> \n> Rule: when head moves to a cell, if it has food, eat it and grow, so tail doesn't move. If no food, tail moves forward, so the cell is freed.\n> \n> In this case, on turn 15, if I move to (3,3), no food there, so after move, head at (3,3), then the tail moves from (3,2) to? The snake moves: head to new position, each segment moves to previous position of the next, so tail is removed if no growth.\n> \n> Current positions: turn 15 start: head (4,3), body (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), tail (3,2).\n> \n> After move to (3,3), no food, so new positions: head (3,3), then body segments: (4,3) becomes first body, (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), and tail (3,2) is removed? Let's see the order.\n> \n> Snake positions list: before move: [(4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (3,2)]\n> \n> After moving head to (3,3), and no food eaten, the body follows: the segment that was behind head moves to head's old position, and so on.\n> \n> So new positions: head at (3,3), then the previous head (4,3) is now first body segment, so (3,3), (4,3), then (4,2), (4,1), and (3,1) becomes the new tail? Positions: the body segments are the tail positions shifted.\n> \n> After move: head to new position (3,3), then the second segment moves to where head was, (4,3), third to where second was, (4,2), fourth to where third was, (4,1), and tail moves to where fourth was, which was (3,1). But (3,1) was the fourth segment, so tail moves to (3,1), and the old tail (3,2) is removed.\n> \n> So new snake: [(3,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1)] and tail is at (3,1).\n> \n> Before: indices: 0:head (4,3), 1: (4,2), 2: (4,1), 3: (3,1), 4:tail (3,2)\n> \n> After move left to (3,3), no food: head new (3,3), segment 1 moves to (4,3) which was head old, segment 2 moves to (4,2) which was seg1 old, segment 3 moves to (4,1) which was seg2 old, segment 4 moves to (3,1) which was seg3 old? seg3 was (3,1), so seg4 should move to where seg3 was? Standard snake movement: each body segment takes the position of the previous segment in the list.\n> \n> When head moves to a new cell, the body segments each move to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> So: new head position: (3,3)\n> \n> Then the first body segment (index 1) moves to old head position (4,3)\n> \n> Second body segment (index 2) moves to old position of index 1, which is (4,2)\n> \n> Third body segment (index 3) moves to old position of index 2, which is (4,1)\n> \n> Fourth body segment (index 4, tail) moves to old position of index 3, which is (3,1)\n> \n> And the old position of tail (3,2) is now empty.\n> \n> So new positions: head (3,3), body: (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), tail (3,1)\n> \n> Similarly, if I move right.\n> \n> But back to turn 15 choices.\n> \n> If I move L to (3,3) on turn 15.\n> \n> Then head at (3,3), direction L.\n> \n> For turn 16, I can move U, D, L (since L is current, reverse is R, so cannot move R).\n> \n> Now, from (3,3), U to (3,4), D to (3,2), L to (2,3), or R but cannot.\n> \n> (3,2) is now free? After move, positions are (3,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), so (3,2) is empty now, since tail moved to (3,1).\n> \n> (3,2) was tail before, but after move, it's free.\n> \n> So from (3,3), D to (3,2) is possible, free cell.\n> \n> U to (3,4) free.\n> \n> L to (2,3) which has food!

No.\n> \n> Standard: when no eat, tail moves, last position removed.\n> \n> When eat, tail doesn't move, and we keep the tail position, so the new segment is the old tail position.\n> \n> So positions before move: [A, B, C, D, E] with A head, E tail.\n> \n> Move head to new cell F, if no food, new positions [F, A, B, C, D] — E removed.\n> \n> If food, new positions [F, A, B, C, D, E] — E is new tail, and D was second last, now body.\n> \n> In this case, before move turn 16: positions [ (3,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1) ] so A=(3,3), B=(4,3), C=(4,2), D=(4,1), E=(3,1) tail.\n> \n> Move to F=(2,3), with food, so new positions: head F=(2,3), then A, B, C, D, E, so [ (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1) ] and tail is (3,1).\n> \n> But (3,1) is still the tail, and we have an extra segment.\n> \n> Now, after eating at (2,3), food is consumed, so it disappears.\n> \n> Then for turn 17, head at (2,3), direction L (since moved left).\n> \n> Possible moves: from (2,3), U to (2,4), D to (2,2), L to (1,3), R to (3,3) but (3,3) is now body segment, so cannot move there.\n> \n> (3,3) is body, so moving to (3,3) would collide.\n> \n> L to (1,3) which has food, so I can eat it immediately on turn 17 if I move L.\n> \n> (1,3) has food with life span 6 at turn 15, but turn 16 has passed?

New head at (2,3), and tail stays or moves? When I eat, the snake grows, so after moving to (2,3), the new positions: head at (2,3), then previous head (3,3) becomes body, so snake becomes [(2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1)] but since I ate, I grow, so tail doesn't move? Rule: when eating positive food, length +1, so tail stays in place.\n> \n> Standard snake: when you eat, you grow, so the tail doesn't move that turn.\n> \n> In this case, after eating at (2,3), head moves to (2,3), body segments follow, but since growth, the last segment (tail) is not removed, so positions become: [(2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1)] with (3,1) still there.\n> \n> Then on next turn, when I move, tail moves.\n> \n> But (2,3) has food, so if I move there, I eat it.\n> \n> Is there any danger?

Obstacles are (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), so (1,3) is not an obstacle, it's just food.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,1), (1,6), etc. might be free, but borders.\n> \n> x=1, y=3: not border, not obstacle, so accessible.\n> \n> But to reach (1,3), I need to go to (1,3) from, say, (2,3).\n> \n> Now, if I move left to (2,3) now, I eat it, grow to length 6.\n> \n> Then from (2,3), possible moves: since head direction was L to (2,3), so direction now L?

No, borders are walls, so cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls, meaning snake can't go there. Similarly, internal obstacles are also walls.\n> \n> So, walkable cells: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except the internal obstacles.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4)\n> \n> (1,2), (1,4), (1,5) are all at x=1, so that row might be tricky.\n> \n> List all blocked cells:\n> \n> - Borders: all cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7.\n> \n> - Internal: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4)\n> \n> (1,4) and (1,5) and (1,2) are separate, but (1,4) and (1,5) are both at x=1, y=4 and y=5.\n> \n> Snake is at: (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1)\n> \n> Head at (2,3), moving left.

Is (1,3) available? (1,3) is not listed as wall. Borders are x=0,7 y=0,7, so (1,3) is within 1-6, and internal obstacles are (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), but not (1,3). (1,3) is not in internal obstacles list. Internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4). So (1,3) is free? But there is food at (1,3), which is positive.\n> \n> (1,3) has food, and it's a valid cell.\n> \n> But let's check if moving to (1,3) is safe.\n> \n> - Up: to (2,4).

Tail position: current tail is at (3,1). Head is moving to (1,3), which is not adjacent to tail or anything immediately dangerous.\n> \n> But let's think about Tail Reward Danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills.\n> \n> Here, tail is at (3,1), head at (2,3), not adjacent. After moving to (1,3), head at (1,3), tail at (3,1), not adjacent. So no issue.\n> \n> But (1,3) might be under body? No, currently snake positions: (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1). So (1,3) is not occupied by snake, it's free with food.\n> \n> So moving left seems safe and gets +1 immediately.\n> \n> But I need to think long-term.

That can't be right.\n> \n> After moving to (1,3), the cell (2,3) is occupied by the second segment, so from (1,3), the only adjacent cells are:\n> \n> - Left: (0,3) - wall, invalid\n> \n> - Right: (2,3) - occupied by snake body, invalid\n> \n> - Up: (1,4) - obstacle, invalid\n> \n> - Down: (1,2) - obstacle, invalid\n> \n> So no valid moves!

It's turn 18, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since the borders are x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7. So the grid is from (0,0) to (7,7).\n> \n> Walls: Border cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 – so those are the boundaries. Also, internal obstacles at (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4). I should note these down so I avoid them.\n> \n> Snake positions: Head is at (2,4), then body segments: (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1). So the snake has 6 segments. Head direction is Up, which means it's moving upwards.\n> \n> Food:\n> \n> - (1,3) with value 1 and life span 3. So it disappears after 3 turns, including this one, so by turn 20 it's gone if not eaten.\n> \n> - (4,6) with value 1 and life span 8. So it has a longer life, until turn 25 (18 + 8 - 1? Let's calculate life span: it says \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn including current\". So for (1,3), life span 3 at turn 18, so it will be gone after turn 20 (turn 18: count 3, turn 19: count 2, turn 20: count 1, then gone? No: \"disappears after N turns\" means after N turns from now. If life span is N, it has N turns including current to be eaten. So at turn t, food with life span L will disappear at turn t + L - 1? Let's read carefully.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So, for food at turn t with life span N, it will be present for this turn and the next N-1 turns, so it disappears at turn t + N. For example, at turn 18, life span 3: it is available on turns 18, 19, 20, and disappears after turn 20, so not available on turn 21.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,6) with life span 8: available from turn 18 to turn 25 (18+7=25? Turn 18: countdown 8, turn 19: countdown 7, ..., turn 25: countdown 1, then after turn 25, it disappears? \"Disappears after N turns\" might be ambiguous.\n> \n> I think it's better to interpret: if life span is N at turn t, it decreases by 1 each turn, and when countdown reaches 0, it disappears. So at turn t, countdown = N, at turn t+1, countdown = N-1, ..., at turn t + N - 1, countdown = 1, then at turn t + N, it disappears. So it can be eaten until turn t + N - 1.\n> \n> For (1,3): life span 3 at turn 18, so countdown: turn 18: 3, turn 19: 2, turn 20: 1, turn 21: gone. So can be eaten on turns 18,19,20.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,6): life span 8, can be eaten from turn 18 to turn 25 (since turn 18:8, 19:7, ..., 25:1, 26:gone).\n> \n> But turn 25 countdown 1, eaten or not, gone after that.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (2,4), direction Up. So current position: head (2,4), next segments (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1).\n> \n> From the positions: (2,4) head, then (2,3) which is below, so since head is moving Up, to (2,4) from previous? Positions are given as list: index 0 head, then body.\n> \n> Head at (2,4), next is (2,3), which is directly below, so snake was moving down to (2,3)? But head direction is given as U, meaning current direction is Up.\n> \n> Perhaps the head direction is the direction it is facing now, but from positions, to go from previous position to current, it might be different.\n> \n> The state says \"Snake Head Direction: U\", so current moving direction is Up. But let's see the positions: from (2,3) to (2,4)? Positions are head first: [(2,4), (2,3), ...] so head is at (2,4), and the next segment is (2,3), which is south of it, so the snake moved from (2,3) to (2,4)? No: the list is [head, segment1, segment2, ...], so head is (2,4), segment1 is (2,3), which is directly below, meaning the head is above segment1. So to reach head from segment1, it moved up. So direction Up makes sense; it moved from (2,3) to (2,4) by moving up.\n> \n> Then segment1 (2,3) to segment2 (3,3), which is east, so it turned right or something. But current head direction is Up, so for next move, I can choose U, D, L, R, but cannot instant reverse, which would be Down, since Up is current direction, opposite is Down, so I cannot move Down next turn.\n> \n> Movement constraints: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\"\n> \n> Current direction is U, so I cannot move D on the next turn. Options are U, L, R.\n> \n> Now, grid: let's sketch this to visualize.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. (0,0) bottom-left? Usually in coordinates, but in games, y might increase upwards or downwards. Here it says for movement U: (x,y+1), so y increases upwards, I assume. D: (x,y-1), so y decreases downwards. So (0,0) is bottom-left, (7,7) top-right.\n> \n> Walls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4)\n> \n> Snake: positions: (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1)\n> \n> So let's list cells:\n> \n> Head: (2,4)\n> \n> Body: (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1) — that's 5 body segments, so total snake length 6.\n> \n> Food:\n> \n> - (1,3) value +1, life span 3, so available turns 18,19,20\n> \n> - (4,6) value +1, life span 8, available turns 18 to 25\n> \n> I need to think 5+ turns ahead, prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> First, possible moves from current position (2,4) with direction U.\n> \n> Since direction U, I can move U, L, or R (not D, reverse).\n> \n> Move U: to (2,5)\n> \n> Move L: to (1,4)\n> \n> Move R: to (3,4)\n> \n> Now, check if these are valid:\n> \n> - (2,5): is it wall or body? Walls: borders y=7 is wall, but y=5 <7, x=2 between 0 and 7, so not border wall. Internal obstacles: (1,2),(1,4),(1,5),(4,4),(5,2) — (1,4) is obstacle, but (2,5) not listed, so no. Body: snake positions: (2,4) head, (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1). (2,5) not occupied, so safe to move to? But need to consider that after move, the body moves, so tail leaves (4,1), and head goes to new position.\n> \n> When moving, the head moves to new cell, if it eats food, tail doesn't move, else tail moves forward.\n> \n> But collision: head should not hit body except the tail, because tail will move.\n> \n> Specifically: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, when moving to a cell, if that cell is occupied by body except the tail, it's collision.

It's turn 19, and I'm playing Snake on a grid. The grid has walls: border cells at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and internal obstacles at (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4). So, I can't move into these cells.\n> \n> The snake positions are given as a list: head at (3,4), then body segments at (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,2). So the snake has 6 segments. The head is at (3,4) and is currently moving right (R), which means it was moving east to (4,4) or something? Current head is at (3,4), direction is R, so last move was to the right, to (3,4)? Positions: head (3,4), next is (2,4) which is left, then (2,3) down, etc. I need to visualize this.\n> \n> List of positions: index 0: (3,4) head, index 1: (2,4), index 2: (2,3), index 3: (3,3), index 4: (4,3), index 5: (4,2). Since direction is R, and head is at (3,4), that means it moved right to (3,4) from (2,4) on the previous turn? But (2,4) is the second segment. Let's think about the movement.\n> \n> When the snake moves, the head goes to a new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment in front, and the tail segment is removed unless food is eaten. But here, positions are given before moving, I think.\n> \n> The state is at the start of turn 19, before I make a move. Snake positions are current positions: head at (3,4), with direction R, meaning it is facing right, so it can move right, up, or down, but not left instantly since that would be reverse.\n> \n> Movement constraints: I can move U, D, L, R, but no instant reverse. Since current direction is R, I cannot move L (left) on this turn. So possible moves from (3,4) are U (up to (3,5)), D (down to (3,3)), or R (right to (4,4)). But (4,4) might be occupied or something? I need to check walls and body.\n> \n> First, list all occupied cells: snake positions and walls.\n> \n> Walls: border x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4). (4,4) is an obstacle? (4,4) is listed as an internal obstacle. So (4,4) is a wall, I cannot move there.\n> \n> Snake positions: (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,2). So (4,3) and (4,2) are body parts.\n> \n> From head at (3,4), possible moves:\n> \n> - U: to (3,5) – need to check if this is free.\n> \n> - D: to (3,3) – but (3,3) is a body segment? Positions: (3,3) is the fourth segment, index 3. So (3,3) is occupied by body, so moving to (3,3) would cause collision with body, unless it's the tail and we move away, but (3,3) is not the tail; tail is (4,2).\n> \n> General rule: head cannot move to a cell occupied by any body segment except the tail, because when you move, the tail moves, so if head moves to tail position, it should be ok, as the tail moves forward and head occupies that spot without collision.\n> \n> But in this case, from (3,4) to (3,3), (3,3) is a body segment, but it's not the tail. Tail is (4,2). So moving to (3,3) would collide with the body segment there.\n> \n> Similarly, moving R to (4,4) – but (4,4) is a wall, obstacle, so cannot move there.\n> \n> Moving L to (2,4) – but (2,4) is the second segment, occupied, and also, instant reverse? Direction is R, moving L is opposite, so not allowed. Cannot move left.\n> \n> So only possible moves are U or D.\n> \n> U: to (3,5)\n> \n> D: to (3,3) – but (3,3) is occupied, as per positions.\n> \n> Cells: (3,5) – is this wall or free? Borders: y=7 is top, y=0 bottom, so y=5 is within 0 to 7? Grid size not specified, but walls at y=0 and y=7, so y from 0 to 7 inclusive? That means 8 rows, y=0 to y=7.\n> \n> Similarly x=0 to x=7.\n> \n> (3,5): x=3, y=5, not border, not in internal obstacles: obstacles are (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4). (1,5) is obstacle, but (3,5) is not listed, so should be free.\n> \n> But is it occupied by snake? Snake positions: (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,2). No (3,5), so (3,5) is free.\n> \n> Similarly, D to (3,3): but (3,3) is in snake positions, index 3, so occupied.

But what about other directions?\n> \n> R to (4,4) is wall, L not allowed, D to (3,3) occupied, so only U is possible? But let's confirm.\n> \n> Current head (3,4), direction R.\n> \n> Possible actions: U, D, L, R but L not allowed, R to (4,4) wall, D to (3,3) body, so only U to (3,5) is free and possible.\n> \n> But (3,5) is free, yes.\n> \n> Now, food items:\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (1,3) with value 1, life span 2 (meaning it disappears after 2 turns, including current?

So at turn t, if life_span is L, it can be eaten on turn t, t+1, ..., t+L-1? Let's think.\n> \n> If life span is N at turn t, it means it will disappear after N more turns. Countdown decreases each turn.\n> \n> So at turn t, life_span = N: after this turn (t), countdown becomes N-1; if countdown reaches 0 after a turn, it disappears before the next turn or after? The description says \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> I think it means: at the start of turn t, if food has life_span L, then:\n> \n> - During turn t, it is present and can be eaten.\n> \n> - After turn t, life_span decreases to L-1.\n> \n> - If after decrease, life_span becomes 0, it disappears and is no longer present.\n> \n> So for food at (1,3) with life_span 2 at turn 19:\n> \n> - On turn 19: present, can be eaten, after turn 19, life_span becomes 1.\n> \n> - On turn 20: present (life_span=1), can be eaten, after turn 20, life_span becomes 0, disappears.\n> \n> - So not present on turn 21.\n> \n> Similarly, other food:\n> \n> - (4,6) value 1, life_span 7: will be around for many turns.\n> \n> - (2,5) value 1, life_span 10: also many turns.\n> \n> Now, back to movement: from (3,4), only possible move is U to (3,5), since D is blocked by body, R by wall, L not allowed.\n> \n> But is (3,5) safe?

It's turn 20, and I'm playing Snake on a 8x8 grid since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. That means the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think? Let me confirm: walls at x=0 and x=7, so x-coordinates from 1 to 6 are inside; similarly, y from 1 to 6. Grid size: x from 0 to 7, so cells 0 to 7 inclusive? But walls are at x=0 and x=7, meaning those cells are blocked, so the snake can only be on x=1 to x=6, y=1 to y=6. Similarly for y.\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (3,5), then (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3). So the snake has 6 segments. Head direction is Up, so it was moving upwards to (3,5) from (3,4)?

Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 20, life span 1 means it will disappear after this turn if not eaten. Since we're at turn 20, and life span 1, after turn 20, it's gone. So to eat it, I must move to (1,3) on this turn.\n> \n> Life span: \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So at turn t, if life span is L, it will disappear at the end of turn t + L - 1? Let's clarify.\n> \n> It says: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> For example, at turn t, if life span is N, then:\n> \n> - At the start of turn t, countdown is N\n> \n> - After turn t, countdown becomes N-1\n> \n> - After turn t+1, N-2, ..., after turn t + N -1, countdown 0, disappears.\n> \n> So for food at (1,3) with life span 1 at turn 20: at turn 20, countdown=1, after turn 20, it becomes 0 and disappears. So it can only be eaten on turn 20 by moving to (1,3) during turn 20.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (4,6) life span 6: at turn 20, countdown=6, will disappear after turn 25.\n> \n> (2,5) life span 9: disappear after turn 28.\n> \n> But I need to plan actions starting from turn 20.\n> \n> Current head position: (3,5), direction U (up).\n> \n> Possible moves: U, D, L, R, but cannot reverse instantly.

Walls at y=0 and y=7, so cells with y=1 to y=6 are inside. y=6 is the top, not a wall. Similarly, x=1 to x=6.\n> \n> So (3,6) is within bounds.\n> \n> Is there an obstacle? Internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4). None at (3,6), so ok.\n> \n> But snake body: positions are (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3).

Snake body: all positions are below, (4,3) is tail, but (4,5) empty.\n> \n> Now, also, food at (2,5) is present, so moving L to (2,5) would eat that food if I go there.\n> \n> (2,5) has food with value 1.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (1,3) but that's not adjacent to head; head at (3,5), (1,3) is two steps away.\n> \n> And (4,6) is at (4,6), which is north-east.\n> \n> But for immediate move, I have three choices: U, L, R.\n> \n> Now, I need to think long-term, 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> First, the food at (1,3) has life span 1, so I can only eat it this turn, turn 20, by moving to (1,3). But from (3,5), to (1,3) is not adjacent; it's two moves away. I can't reach it this turn. So impossible to eat (1,3) food. It will disappear after this turn.\n> \n> Life span 1 at turn 20: since countdown decreases every turn including current, after turn 20, it disappears. So during turn 20, if head moves to it, it can be eaten. But head is at (3,5), (1,3) is at distance: dx=2, dy=2, so Manhattan distance 4, not adjacent. So I cannot reach it this turn. Thus, (1,3) food will be gone and I can't eat it. Ignore it.\n> \n> Now, other foods: (2,5) and (4,6).\n> \n> (2,5) is adjacent to head: (3,5) to (2,5) is left, so moving L would eat it.\n> \n> (4,6) is at (4,6), which is up-right from head (3,5), so moving U to (3,6) or R to (4,5), then to (4,6) next turn?

It's turn 21, and I'm playing Snake on a 8x8 grid since the walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So coordinates range from (0,0) to (7,7).\n> \n> Walls: Border cells are all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Also, internal obstacles at (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4). I should note these down to avoid them.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), (4,4), (5,2). (1,4) and (1,5) are listed, but (1,4) is mentioned twice? No, in the input it says: \"Internal Obstacles: [(5, 2), (4, 4), (1, 2), (1, 5), (1, 4)]\" so that's five points: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), and (1,4). All distinct.\n> \n> Snake positions: Head is at (2,5), then body segments: (3,5), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3). So let's list them in order:\n> \n> - Head: (2,5)\n> \n> - Segment 1: (3,5)\n> \n> - Segment 2: (3,4)\n> \n> - Segment 3: (2,4)\n> \n> - Segment 4: (2,3)\n> \n> - Segment 5: (3,3)\n> \n> - Segment 6: (4,3)\n> \n> So the snake has 7 segments, meaning length 7. When it eats positive food, length increases by 1.\n> \n> Head direction is L, which is left. So current direction is left, meaning from (2,5) it came from the right, I think? Snake positions show head at (2,5), then (3,5), so it was moving left to (2,5) from (3,5), so current direction is left.\n> \n> Food: Only one food mentioned: (4,6) with life span 6 and value 1. So positive food at (4,6), life span 6, meaning it will disappear after 6 turns, including this turn. So if not eaten by turn 26, it's gone.\n> \n> Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 21, life span 6, it will be there for turns 21,22,23,24,25,26, and disappear after turn 26 or at the start of turn 27? Typically, it disappears after N turns, so if spawned at turn T, it lasts until turn T + N - 1 or something. But here it says \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> Let's read: \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So for food at turn t, with life span L, countdown starts at L, decreases by 1 each turn. When countdown reaches 0, it disappears. So at turn t, countdown = L; turn t+1, countdown = L-1; ... turn t+L-1, countdown =1; turn t+L, countdown=0 and disappears.\n> \n> In this case, food at (4,6) with life span 6 at turn 21. So:\n> \n> - Turn 21: countdown =6\n> \n> - Turn 22: countdown=5\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - Turn 26: countdown=1\n> \n> - Turn 27: countdown=0, disappears. So it can be eaten from turn 21 to 26 inclusive.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan an action sequence for at least 5 turns ahead, but since the food has limited life, I should consider that.\n> \n> First, let's sketch the grid to visualize.\n> \n> Grid size: 8x8, x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n> \n> Walls: borders, so cells where x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. Also internal obstacles: (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), (4,4), (5,2).\n> \n> Snake positions:\n> \n> - Head: (2,5)\n> \n> - Body: (3,5), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3)\n> \n> So let's list all occupied cells:\n> \n> - (2,5): head\n> \n> - (3,5)\n> \n> - (3,4)\n> \n> - (2,4)\n> \n> - (2,3)\n> \n> - (3,3)\n> \n> - (4,3)\n> \n> Also, tail is at (4,3).\n> \n> Food at (4,6)\n> \n> Current head direction: Left, so from (2,5), it can move to adjacent cells, but not opposite direction immediately, but since it's moving, the direction constraint is for the next move.\n> \n> Movement constraints: I can choose to move U, D, L, R, but cannot move opposite to current direction on the next turn. Current direction is L, so I cannot move R (right) on this turn, because it would be instant reverse.\n> \n> The rule says: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\"\n> \n> \"on next turn\" – I think it means for the immediate next move.\n> \n> Let's read carefully: \"Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\"\n> \n> And \"current direction\" is given as head direction.\n> \n> So at turn t, with head direction D, for the action at turn t, I cannot choose the opposite of D.\n> \n> For example, here direction is L, so at turn 21, I cannot move R, because that would be opposite to left.\n> \n> Possible moves from (2,5): adjacent cells are:\n> \n> - Up: (2,6)\n> \n> - Down: (2,4) – but (2,4) is occupied by body, segment 3? Positions: (2,5) head, then (3,5), (3,4), (2,4), so (2,4) is a body segment. Moving to (2,4) would cause collision with body.\n> \n> - Left: (1,5) – but (1,5) is an internal obstacle, wall, so cannot move there.\n> \n> - Right: (3,5) – but (3,5) is the first body segment, so moving there would cause collision.\n> \n> Adjacent cells:\n> \n> - North/Up: (2,6) – y+1\n> \n> - South/Down: (2,4) – y-1\n> \n> - West/Left: (1,5) – x-1\n> \n> - East/Right: (3,5) – x+1\n> \n> Now, (2,4) is occupied by snake body, so moving down to (2,4) would collide.\n> \n> (1,5) is a wall, internal obstacle, so cannot move there.\n> \n> (3,5) is occupied by snake body, so cannot move right.\n> \n> (2,6): what is at (2,6)?

Internal obstacles: (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), (4,4), (5,2) – none at (2,6), and snake not there, so (2,6) should be free.\n> \n> Similarly, is there any other direction?

At turn 22, moving Left would lead to a dead end due to surrounding walls and body, so Right is chosen to both survive and approach the food. At turn 23, moving Right eats the positive food at (4,6) safely, increasing score and length. Subsequent moves (Turn 24 Right and Turn 25 Down) prioritize escaping confined areas and navigating toward open spaces for long-term survival.\n",

It's turn 22. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and internal obstacles at (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4). So, these are cells the snake can't move into.\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (2,6), then body segments at (2,5), (3,5), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3). So the snake is 7 segments long. Head direction is Up, meaning it was moving upwards last turn.\n> \n> Food: two pieces:\n> \n> - (4,6) with life span 5, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (1,6) with life span 10, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> Both are positive food, so eating them increases length by 1 and score by 1.\n> \n> I need to plan an action sequence for the next few turns, thinking at least 5 turns ahead. Prioritize long-term survival over immediate rewards.\n> \n> First, let's sketch the grid. It's 8x8 since borders are x=0 to 7, y=0 to 7, so cells from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls on the borders, so playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6)? No, let's clarify.\n> \n> Border cells: x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. So the grid has walls on the edges. Internal obstacles at (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4). (1,4) and (1,5) are obstacles, but (1,6) has food? (1,6) is on the border? x=1, y=6. y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=6 is not a border wall. Similarly, x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x=1 is not border. Borders are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. Therefore, playable cells are x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? Let's confirm.\n> \n> x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x from 1 to 6 is playable. Similarly, y=0 and y=7 walls, so y from 1 to 6 playable. But y=7 is wall, so y from 1 to 6, since y=0 and y=7 are walls.\n> \n> y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y coordinates from 1 to 6 are playable. Similarly x from 1 to 6.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (2,6). y=6 is the top row, since y=7 is wall, so (2,6) is adjacent to the top wall.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (4,6) and (1,6), both on y=6.\n> \n> Head direction is Up, but Up means increasing y, I assume? Let's check the movement: U (x,y+1), D (x,y-1), L (x-1,y), R (x+1,y). So y increases upwards, I think. Typically in grids, y increases up or down? The notation says U (x,y+1), so y+1 is up, meaning higher y is up.\n> \n> But in the state, snake positions: head (2,6), then (2,5), (3,5), etc. (2,6) to (2,5) is down, since y decreased. But head direction is given as U, which is Up.\n> \n> Head direction is the direction it moved last turn. So from previous position to current head position. Snake positions list: [(2,6), (2,5), ...] so head is at (2,6), and it came from (2,5), so it moved from (2,5) to (2,6), which is Up, since y increased from 5 to 6. Yes, so direction Up means it moved upwards to get to (2,6).\n> \n> Now, possible moves from (2,6):\n> \n> - Up: to (2,7), but y=7 is wall, so not possible.\n> \n> - Down: to (2,5), but (2,5) is the second segment of the snake, so body collision? Let's see the positions: snake is [(2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3)]\n> \n> So (2,5) is occupied by the body. If I move down to (2,5), that's where the body is. But according to rules, body collision is deadly, except that moving into the tail segment might be ok if the tail moves.\n> \n> Rules: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, tail segment: the last segment is (3,3). If head moves to a cell that will be vacated by the tail, it's ok.\n> \n> In this case, from (2,6), possible moves:\n> \n> - U: (2,7) - wall, invalid\n> \n> - D: (2,5) - occupied by body segment, which is not the tail. (2,5) is the second segment, not the tail. Tail is (3,3). So moving to (2,5) would cause collision with body.\n> \n> - L: (1,6) - what's there? (1,6) has food, but is it occupied? Snake positions: (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), etc., no (1,6) in snake, so not occupied. But there is an obstacle? Internal obstacles: (1,2), (1,5), (1,4). (1,4) and (1,5) are obstacles, but (1,6) is not listed as obstacle. Obstacles are (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4). So (1,6) is not an obstacle, and not occupied by snake, so it should be free, but has food.\n> \n> Food at (1,6), so it's a cell with food, but snake can move there to eat it.\n> \n> - R: (3,6) - what's there? Snake positions: head (2,6), then (2,5), (3,5), etc. (3,6) is not in snake positions. Obstacles: no (3,6) listed. Walls: not border wall since x=3, y=6, x from 1-6, y from 1-6, so (3,6) should be free. No food mentioned, so empty cell.\n> \n> So possible moves from (2,6):\n> \n> - U: invalid, wall\n> \n> - D: (2,5) - occupied by body, collision\n> \n> - L: (1,6) - has food, and not occupied or obstacle\n> \n> - R: (3,6) - empty, no food\n> \n> Also, cannot move opposite to current direction. Current head direction is U, so opposite is D. But D is already invalid due to collision, so no issue.\n> \n> Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn. But this is the current turn, turn 22.\n> \n> Action for turn 22: from current position (2,6), with head direction U.\n> \n> Possible actions: U, D, L, R, but U invalid, D invalid, so only L or R.\n> \n> L to (1,6) or R to (3,6).\n> \n> Now, (1,6) has positive food, value 1, life span 10. Eating it would increase length by 1.\n> \n> But I need to think long-term.\n> \n> Also, there's food at (4,6) with life span 5.\n> \n> Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 22, life span 5 means it will disappear after 5 turns, so on turn 27 it will be gone? Life span decreases every turn, including current turn.\n> \n> \"Life-span Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So for food at (4,6), life span 5 on turn 22. After turn 22, life span becomes 4 on turn 23, and so on, until life span 0, then it disappears. So it can be eaten from turn 22 to 26, and disappears after turn 26 or on turn 27? Typically, it exists as long as life span >0.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,6) life span 10, so lasts longer.\n> \n> Now, if I move to (1,6), I eat the food, snake grows to length 8. New head position (1,6), and tail remains or moves? When you eat food, the tail doesn't move that turn, so the snake grows.\n> \n> Rules: when eating positive food, length +1, so after moving to food, the tail doesn't advance, so a new segment is added where the tail was, so the tail position stays for that turn, then next turn it moves.\n> \n> But in terms of positions, when head moves to food, it occupies that cell, and the body follows, but since tail doesn't move, the snake extends by one cell.\n> \n> Now, after moving to (1,6), the new positions would be: head at (1,6), then the previous head (2,6) becomes body, and so on, down to tail at (3,3), but since we ate food, the tail doesn't move, so positions: [ (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3) ] so 8 segments, tail at (3,3).\n> \n> Head direction would be L, since we moved left.\n> \n> But is there any danger? (1,6) is on the left edge, x=1, not border, but internal obstacles: (1,2), (1,4), (1,5) are obstacles, so (1,6) is free, but (1,5) is obstacle below it.\n> \n> If I move to (1,6), then on next turn, possible moves from (1,6):\n> \n> Head direction L (since moved left).\n> \n> Possible moves:\n> \n> - U: (1,7) - y=7 wall, invalid\n> \n> - D: (1,5) - but (1,5) is internal obstacle, so invalid\n> \n> - L: (0,6) - x=0 wall, invalid\n> \n> - R: (2,6) - which is occupied by the body segment, since after move, (2,6) is the second segment.\n> \n> So from (1,6), only possible move is R to (2,6), but (2,6) is body, so collision? (2,6) is occupied by the snake body.\n> \n> But according to rules, moving into a body segment is deadly, except if it's the tail segment that will move.\n> \n> In this case, (2,6) is the second segment, not the tail. Tail is at (3,3). So moving to (2,6) would cause collision with body.\n> \n> Moreover, all other directions are invalid: U, D, L all walls or obstacles.\n> \n> So from (1,6), only possible action is R to (2,6), but that's occupied by body, so instant death.\n> \n> Therefore, moving to (1,6) on turn 22 leads to death on turn 23, because no valid moves except into body.\n> \n> Is that right? Let me confirm.\n> \n> After moving to (1,6) on turn 22:\n> \n> Snake positions: head (1,6), body: (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3)\n> \n> On turn 23, from (1,6), head direction L.\n> \n> Possible moves:\n> \n> - U: (1,7) invalid, wall\n> \n> - D: (1,5) invalid, obstacle\n> \n> - L: (0,6) invalid, wall\n> \n> - R: (2,6) which is occupied by the first body segment.\n> \n> Since (2,6) is not the tail, and tail is at (3,3), moving to (2,6) causes head to touch body, collision, death.\n> \n> No other moves, so indeed, moving to (1,6) is suicidal because it traps the snake with no escape.\n> \n> Therefore, I cannot move L to (1,6) on turn 22.\n> \n> That only leaves moving R to (3,6) on turn 22.\n> \n> Move to (3,6), which is empty, no food eaten.\n> \n> Then new head position (3,6), head direction R.\n> \n> Snake positions: since no food eaten, tail moves, so the tail (3,3) moves away? When no food, head moves to new position, each segment moves to the next position, tail leaves its position.\n> \n> So after move to (3,6): head (3,6), then previous head (2,6) becomes second segment, (2,5) third, (3,5) fourth, (3,4) fifth, (2,4) sixth, (2,3) seventh, and tail was (3,3), but since tail moves, (2,3) becomes the new tail? Let's list:\n> \n> Original positions: [(2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3)] length 7.\n> \n> After moving head to (3,6): head to (3,6), then body: the first body segment moves to (2,6), which was head, then (2,5) to (2,5)? No.\n> \n> The snake moves: the head moves to new position, each subsequent segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> So: head moves to (3,6)\n> \n> Then segment that was at (2,5) moves to where head was, (2,6)? Let's index.\n> \n> Positions: index 0: head (2,6)\n> \n> Index 1: (2,5)\n> \n> Index 2: (3,5)\n> \n> Index 3: (3,4)\n> \n> Index 4: (2,4)\n> \n> Index 5: (2,3)\n> \n> Index 6: tail (3,3)\n> \n> After move R to (3,6):\n> \n> New head: (3,6)\n> \n> Then new position 1: previous head (2,6)\n> \n> New position 2: previous position 1 (2,5)\n> \n> New position 3: previous position 2 (3,5)\n> \n> New position 4: previous position 3 (3,4)\n> \n> New position 5: previous position 4 (2,4)\n> \n> New position 6: previous position 5 (2,3)\n> \n> And the tail was previous position 6 (3,3), which is no longer part of snake, so it vacates.\n> \n> So new positions: [(3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3)] so tail at (2,3), length still 7.\n> \n> Head direction now R.\n> \n> Now, from (3,6), on turn 23, possible moves.\n> \n> Head direction R (since moved right).\n> \n> Possible moves:\n> \n> - U: (3,7) invalid, wall\n> \n> - D: (3,5) - what's there? (3,5) is occupied by body segment, position 3 in new list? New positions: head (3,6), then (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), etc. So (3,5) is the fourth segment, not tail. Tail is (2,3).\n> \n> So moving to (3,5) would be body collision.\n> \n> - L: (2,6) - (2,6) is the second segment, occupied, collision.\n> \n> - R: (4,6) - (4,6) has food? Yes, positive food at (4,6) with life span 5.\n> \n> (4,6) is not occupied by snake, not wall, not obstacle. Obstacles are (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), so (4,6) is free, has food.\n> \n> So possible moves: only R to (4,6) is valid, since U and D invalid, L to body.\n> \n> L to (2,6) is body, D to (3,5) body, U wall, so only R to (4,6).\n> \n> If I move to (4,6), I eat the food, so snake grows.\n> \n> But let's see what happens.\n> \n> On turn 23, move to (4,6), eat food, value +1, length +1.\n> \n> New positions: head (4,6), then previous head (3,6) becomes body, and since food eaten, tail doesn't move, so positions: [ (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3) ] and the tail (2,3) stays, so length 8.\n> \n> Head direction R.\n> \n> Now, from (4,6), on turn 24, possible moves.\n> \n> Head direction R.\n> \n> - U: (4,7) invalid, wall\n> \n> - D: (4,5) - what's there?

That means it disappears after 4 turns, including this one, so it has 4 turns left including turn 23. After turn 23, it will have 3 left, then 2, then 1, then gone after turn 26 or something. Let's clarify: life span decreases every turn, including current, so on turn 23, life span is 4, meaning it will disappear after 4 more turns? No, it says \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So if life span is N on turn t, it will be gone by turn t + N. For example, on turn 23, life span 4, so it exists until the end of turn 26, and disappears before turn 27. Similarly, it can be eaten on turns 23, 24, 25, 26.\n> \n> - Another food at (1,6) with value 1 and life span 9, so it will last until turn 31.\n> \n> Both foods are positive, value 1, so eating them increases length by 1.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n> \n> First, let's map out the grid.

Possible moves: since head direction is right, I can't move left instantly (no instant reverse), but I can move up, down, or right? No instant reverse means I can't go opposite to current direction on the next turn. Current direction is R, so I cannot move left on this turn. But for the sequence, I need to plan multiple turns.\n> \n> Available moves from (3,6):\n> \n> - Up: (3,7) but y=7 is a wall, so invalid.\n> \n> - Down: (3,5) but (3,5) is occupied by the snake's body? Snake positions: head (3,6), then (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (3,4), etc. So (3,5) is the fourth segment, which is body, so moving down to (3,5) would be a body collision, deadly. Cannot.\n> \n> - Left: (2,6) but (2,6) is the second segment, the neck, so moving left would collide with body.

Value 1, so snake length increases by 1. After eating, the head moves to (4,6), and since we ate, a new segment is added, so the tail doesn't move this turn. Snake growth: when you eat, head moves to food cell, body follows, tail stays, so length increases.\n> \n> Standard snake mechanics: when you eat, head moves to food, new segment is added at the tail position, but the tail doesn't move that turn? Let me think.\n> \n> Typically: when snake moves, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, and tail segment is removed if no food eaten. If food eaten, tail segment is not removed, so snake grows.\n> \n> So in this case, if I move to (4,6) and eat the food, then:\n> \n> - Head was at (3,6), moves to (4,6)\n> \n> - Body: segment 2 was at (2,6), moves to previous head position (3,6)\n> \n> - Segment 3 was at (2,5), moves to previous segment 2 position (2,6)? Let's list positions before move:\n> \n> Positions: index 0: head (3,6), 1: (2,6), 2: (2,5), 3: (3,5), 4: (3,4), 5: (2,4), 6: (2,3) tail.\n> \n> After move right to (4,6) and eat food:\n> \n> - New head: (4,6)\n> \n> - Segment 1 moves to (3,6) [previous head]\n> \n> - Segment 2 moves to (2,6) [previous segment 1]\n> \n> - Segment 3 moves to (2,5) [previous segment 2]\n> \n> - Segment 4 moves to (3,5) [previous segment 3]\n> \n> - Segment 5 moves to (3,4) [previous segment 4]\n> \n> - Segment 6 moves to (2,4) [previous segment 5]\n> \n> - And since food eaten, a new segment is added at the previous tail position? No.\n> \n> Standard: when food eaten, the tail does not move, so the new position has the head at new cell, all body segments shift, and the tail remains, so the snake grows by one.\n> \n> After move:\n> \n> - Head: (4,6)\n> \n> - Body: (3,6) [was head]\n> \n> - Then (2,6) [was segment 1]\n> \n> - (2,5) [was segment 2]\n> \n> - (3,5) [was segment 3]\n> \n> - (3,4) [was segment 4]\n> \n> - (2,4) [was segment 5]\n> \n> - And tail was (2,3), but since food eaten, tail stays, so now segments: head (4,6), then (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (3,4), (2,4), and the old tail (2,3) is now part of body, and new tail is (2,4)? Let's list:\n> \n> New positions:\n> \n> - Index 0: (4,6) new head\n> \n> - Index 1: (3,6) [previous head]\n> \n> - Index 2: (2,6) [previous index 1]\n> \n> - Index 3: (2,5) [previous index 2]\n> \n> - Index 4: (3,5) [previous index 3]\n> \n> - Index 5: (3,4) [previous index 4]\n> \n> - Index 6: (2,4) [previous index 5]\n> \n> - Index 7: (2,3) [previous tail, not moved since food eaten]\n> \n> Previous tail was (2,3), and since food eaten, it stays, so now it's index 7, the new tail.\n> \n> Positions: before move, tail was (2,3). After move and eat, head moves to (4,6), body segments move to the position of the previous segment, so segment 1 moves to (3,6), which was head, segment 2 moves to (2,6), which was seg1, etc., down to segment 6 (tail) would move to (2,4) if no eat, but since eat, segment 6 stays at (2,4)? I think I'm confusing indices.\n> \n> Let S be positions before move: S[0] = head (3,6), S[1] = (2,6), S[2] = (2,5), S[3] = (3,5), S[4] = (3,4), S[5] = (2,4), S[6] = (2,3) tail.\n> \n> After move to (4,6) and eat:\n> \n> - New head: (4,6)\n> \n> - New body: S[0] becomes part of body at (3,6)\n> \n> - Then S[1] moves to S[0] position? No.\n> \n> In snake movement, when moving to a new cell:\n> \n> - The head moves to the new cell.\n> \n> - Each body segment moves to the position of the segment that was ahead of it.\n> \n> So for segment i, it moves to the position that segment i-1 was at before the move.\n> \n> After move:\n> \n> - New position 0: (4,6)  // new head position\n> \n> - Position 1: S[0] = (3,6)  // previous head position\n> \n> - Position 2: S[1] = (2,6)  // previous position of segment 1\n> \n> - Position 3: S[2] = (2,5)  // previous position of segment 2\n> \n> - Position 4: S[3] = (3,5)  // previous position of segment 3\n> \n> - Position 5: S[4] = (3,4)  // previous position of segment 4\n> \n> - Position 6: S[5] = (2,4)  // previous position of segment 5\n> \n> - And since food eaten, we add a new segment at the previous tail position S[6] = (2,3), so position 7: (2,3)\n> \n> But S[5] was (2,4), which moved to position 6, and S[6] (2,3) is now position 7.\n> \n> In terms of cells: new snake positions: head (4,6), then (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (3,4), (2,4), and (2,3) as tail.\n> \n> Now, tail is at (2,3), but (2,4) is also there? Position 6 is (2,4), position 7 is (2,3).\n> \n> But (2,4) was S[5], and it moved to the position of S[5], which is (2,4), but since segments shift, S[5] moves to where S[4] was or something. I think I have it.\n> \n> Standard: the cell that was the tail is not vacated if food eaten, so the snake occupies one more cell.\n> \n> In this case, after eating, the snake occupies: (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (3,4), (2,4), and (2,3). So 8 segments.\n> \n> Now, back to the move: from (3,6), moving right to (4,6) is possible since it's not wall, not body (body is at (2,6), etc., but (4,6) is food, not occupied by snake now.\n> \n> What about the direction? Head direction was R, moving right is fine, not reverse.\n> \n> But is there any risk? Tail reward danger? Tail reward danger is when head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> Here, tail is at (2,3), head is at (3,6), not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing an edge, so (3,6) and (2,3) are not adjacent; (3,6) to (2,3) is diagonal, not adjacent. Adjacent cells are up, down, left, right, so (3,6) adjacent to (3,5), (3,7) invalid, (2,6), (4,6). So (2,6) is adjacent, which is the neck, but tail is (2,3), not adjacent. So no tail reward danger here.\n> \n> Also, food at (4,6) is not under tail, it's free.\n> \n> So moving right to eat (4,6) seems safe and beneficial.\n> \n> But life span is 4, so it has to be eaten soon, but we can eat it now.\n> \n> Now, the other food at (1,6) with life span 9, so plenty of time.\n> \n> But let's think ahead. If I eat (4,6), I'm at (4,6), with head direction now right? After moving right, head direction becomes right.\n> \n> Then from there, where can I go?\n> \n> Grid: walls at borders, obstacles.\n> \n> From (4,6):\n> \n> - Up: (4,7) but y=7 wall, invalid.\n> \n> - Down: (4,5). Is (4,5) free? Snake positions after move: (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3). So (4,5) is not occupied, and not wall or obstacle? Obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4). (4,5) is not listed, so should be free.\n> \n> - Left: (3,6) but (3,6) is now the second segment, body, so collision, invalid.\n> \n> - Right: (5,6). (5,6) is not wall (x=7 wall, x=5<7), not obstacle, not snake, so free.\n> \n> So from (4,6), I can move down to (4,5) or right to (5,6).\n> \n> But I need to think long-term.\n> \n> There is food at (1,6), which is to the left, but currently blocked.\n> \n> Also, internal obstacles at (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), so row y=1 has obstacles at x=1, but (1,6) is food, which is at y=6, x=1.\n> \n> (1,6) is at top-left, near wall.\n> \n> After eating (4,6), snake is longer, might be more constrained.\n> \n> Perhaps I should consider not eating (4,6) now, but that seems wasteful since it has short life span.\n> \n> But I have to move this turn.\n> \n> From (3,6), only possible move is right to (4,6), because:\n> \n> - Up: (3,7) wall\n> \n> - Down: (3,5) occupied by snake body (was S[3] (3,5), but after move it might change, but at the time of move, (3,5) is occupied, so cannot move there.\n> \n> - Left: (2,6) occupied by snake body, and also instant reverse not allowed since current direction R.\n> \n> - Right: (4,6) free and food.\n> \n> So only possible move is right to (4,6). Is that right?\n> \n> At turn 23, before move, positions fixed.\n> \n> Cell (3,5): is it occupied? Snake positions: (3,6) head, (2,6) body, (2,5) body, (3,5) body, etc. So (3,5) is occupied by body, so moving down to (3,5) is collision.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,6) is occupied, moving left collision.\n> \n> Up wall.\n> \n> So yes, only possible move is right to (4,6).\n> \n> So for turn 23, I must move right.\n> \n> Then, after that, head at (4,6), direction R.\n> \n> Now turn 24.\n> \n> From (4,6), I can move down or right.\n> \n> Move down to (4,5) or right to (5,6).\n> \n> Now, think about the future.\n> \n> Food at (1,6) is available, but to reach it, I need to go left, but currently snake body is at (3,6), (2,6), etc., so the left side is blocked.\n> \n> After moving to (4,6), positions: as above, (4,6) head, (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3) tail.\n> \n> From (4,6), if I move right to (5,6), that might be okay, but then I'm going away from the other food.\n> \n> If I move down to (4,5), which is free.\n> \n> Now, (4,5) is adjacent to what?\n> \n> Also, obstacle at (4,4), which is below (4,5), so (4,4) is obstacle, cannot go there.\n> \n> From (4,5), I can go left, down, right?

It's turn 24, and I'm playing Snake on a grid. The grid has walls: border cells where x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7 are walls, so the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think? Let me confirm: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? No, the walls are at x=0 and x=7, and y=0 and y=7, so the grid goes from x=1 to x=6 and y=1 to y=6? But let's see the internal obstacles.\n> \n> Internal obstacles are given: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4). So cells with walls include these points.\n> \n> Also, snake positions: head is at (4,6), then (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3). So the snake has 8 segments. Head is at (4,6), moving right? Head direction is R, which is right, so increasing x.\n> \n> Current head direction is R, so from (4,6), moving right would be to (5,6), but let's see possible moves.\n> \n> Food: only one food mentioned: (1,6) with life span 8 and value 1, so positive food.\n> \n> Life span 8 means it disappears after 8 turns, including the current turn? So countdown decreases each turn, starting from turn 24. So it will disappear after turn 24 + 8 - 1? Let's think carefully.\n> \n> If life span is N, and it appears at turn t, it disappears after t + N - 1, I think? The problem says: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> For example, at turn t, life span is N, so it can be eaten from turn t to turn t + N - 1, and disappears at turn t + N.\n> \n> Here, current turn is 24, food at (1,6) has life span 8, so it appeared at some earlier turn? The state doesn't say when it appeared; it just gives current life span.\n> \n> The food position is given with value and life span, so (1,6,8,1) means at (1,6), value 1, life span 8, meaning it has 8 turns left including this one? I think life span is the remaining life.\n> \n> The input says: \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span: - ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 )\" so life_span is the remaining life span, I believe.\n> \n> Similarly, in the description: \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) | Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So at turn 24, life_span=8 means it will disappear after 8 more turns, so at turn 32 (24 + 8), it disappears. It can be eaten from turn 24 to turn 31 inclusive? Let's see: after N turns from now, it disappears, so if N=8, it disappears at turn 24 + 8 = 32. So it is available on turns 24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31. That's 8 turns: 24 to 31 inclusive is 8 turns, disappears at 32.\n> \n> Countdown: at turn 24, countdown=8; turn 25, countdown=7; ... turn 31, countdown=1; turn 32, gone.\n> \n> Yes.\n> \n> Now, snake head is at (4,6), direction R. So possible moves: since current direction is R, I can move U, D, R, but not L, because L is opposite to R, which is not allowed due to \"no instant reverse\". Directions: U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), L is (x-1,y), R is (x+1,y).\n> \n> Current direction R, so cannot move L (left), because that would be opposite. So allowed moves: U (up), D (down), R (right).\n> \n> Now, grid boundaries: walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.

New positions: head (4,5), then (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (3,4), (2,4)\n> \n> So (3,5) is occupied.\n> \n> If I move to (4,5), then from there, possible moves: direction is D, so can move L to (3,5), but (3,5) is occupied, so I can't move there because collision.\n> \n> Similarly, move R to (5,5), which is free.\n> \n> Or move D to (4,4), but (4,4) is wall, so impossible.\n> \n> So only possible move from (4,5) is R to (5,5), since L to (3,5) is occupied and blocked.\n> \n> (3,5) is occupied by body, so moving there would cause collision.\n> \n> Therefore, if I move D to (4,5), I am forced to move right to (5,5) next, because no other choice.\n> \n> Then from (5,5), I can go to other places.\n> \n> But that might lead me away from (1,6).\n> \n> Alternatively, from start, I could move R to (5,6).\n> \n> Then at (5,6), direction R, possible moves: U to (5,7) wall, D to (5,5), R to (6,6).\n> \n> Both (5,5) and (6,6) are free.\n> \n> From there, I can try to go down or right.\n> \n> But to reach (1,6), I need to go left, but I'm at (5,6), so moving left would be towards (4,6), but (4,6) is now body, so I can't go back immediately.\n> \n> I need to find a path to (1,6) that avoids obstacles and body.\n> \n> Let me think about the area around (1,6).\n> \n> (1,6) is at top-left corner. y=6, x=1.\n> \n> Adjacent cells: left is x=0 wall, up y=7 wall, down to (1,5), but (1,5) is wall, so the only access is from right, to (2,6), or from below, but (1,5) wall, so only from (2,6).\n> \n> (1,6) can only be entered from (2,6) or from below, but below is (1,5) which is wall, so only from (2,6).\n> \n> Similarly, (2,6) can be accessed from (2,5), (3,6), or (2,7) but y=7 wall, so only (2,5) and (3,6).\n> \n> But (2,6) is currently occupied by snake body.\n> \n> To eat the food at (1,6), I need to move the snake so that (2,6) is free, and then head moves to (1,6).\n> \n> Currently, (2,6) is occupied by the third segment.\n> \n> As the snake moves, the body will shift.\n> \n> For example, if I move in a way that the snake moves away from (2,6), it might free up.\n> \n> But it's part of the body.\n> \n> Let's think about the tail movement.\n> \n> Tail is at (2,3), and the snake will move, so tail will move to (2,4) or something.\n> \n> But to free (2,6), since it's a body segment, when the snake moves, if no food eaten, the tail moves forward, so positions shift.\n> \n> For instance, if I move the head away, after several moves, the segment at (2,6) will move to other positions.\n> \n> Specifically, the cell (2,6) will be freed when the segment that is now at (2,6) moves away, which happens when the snake moves enough steps.\n> \n> The segment at index 2 is at (2,6). When the snake moves, the head moves to new position, each segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so after one move, the segment that was at (2,6) will be at the position of index 1, which was (3,6), but let's see the indices.\n> \n> Original positions: let's number them: 0: head (4,6), 1: (3,6), 2: (2,6), 3: (2,5), 4: (3,5), 5: (3,4), 6: (2,4), 7: tail (2,3)\n> \n> After one move, say to (4,5) for example, new head (4,5), then segment 0 becomes (4,6), segment 1 becomes old seg1: (3,6), segment 2 becomes old seg2: (2,6), segment 3 becomes old seg3: (2,5), segment 4 becomes old seg4: (3,5), segment 5 becomes old seg5: (3,4), segment 6 becomes old seg6: (2,4), and tail old seg7 (2,3) dropped. So (2,6) is still occupied, by the new segment 2.\n> \n> After another move, it will shift.\n> \n> The cell (2,6) will be occupied until the segment that was at (2,6) moves away or is the tail and moves.\n> \n> The segment at (2,6) is index 2, which will move to the next position when the snake moves.\n> \n> For example, after k moves, the segment that was at position i will be at position i, but the cell changes.\n> \n> To free the cell (2,6), I need the segment currently there to move to a different cell.\n> \n> That will happen when the snake moves in a direction that shifts it away.\n> \n> Since the snake is moving, each move, the body segments advance to the previous position.\n> \n> So the cell (2,6) will be freed when the tail has moved past, but it's not the tail.\n> \n> The segment at (2,6) will be at that position until the snake moves, and it moves to where the previous segment was.\n> \n> But the position (2,6) will be vacated when the segment that is currently there moves to the position of the segment before it.\n> \n> Let's think of the snake as a queue.\n> \n> The head moves, tail is removed.\n> \n> So the cell (2,6) is occupied by a body segment. When the snake moves, that segment moves to the position of the next segment towards the head, but in terms of position, the body segments don't move individually; the whole snake shifts.\n> \n> When the head moves to a new cell, the tail cell is removed, and each body segment moves to the position of the segment one step closer to the head.\n> \n> So for cell (2,6), it is occupied by the segment that was at index 2. After one move, that segment moves to the position that was occupied by index 1, which is (3,6). So after one move, the segment is at (3,6), and (2,6) might be empty or occupied by another segment.\n> \n> After move to (4,5), positions: head (4,5), then body: (4,6) which was head, then (3,6) was index 1, then (2,6) was index 2, so (2,6) is now occupied by the new index 3? New positions: index 0: (4,5), index 1: (4,6), index 2: (3,6), index 3: (2,6), index 4: (2,5), index 5: (3,5), index 6: (3,4), index 7: (2,4)\n> \n> So (2,6) is still occupied, by index 3.\n> \n> Similarly, after another move, it will still be occupied until that segment moves further.\n> \n> The segment that was at (2,6) is now at (3,6) in this new state, but the cell (2,6) is occupied by the next segment.\n> \n> To free (2,6), I need the snake to move in such a way that no segment is at (2,6) for some turn.\n> \n> That might take time because the snake is long.\n> \n> Currently, (2,6) is occupied by a body segment, and it will be for a while.\n> \n> But to eat the food at (1,6), I need to have (2,6) free when I move to (1,6), because I need to move from (2,6) to (1,6).\n> \n> The head needs to be at (2,6) and then move to (1,6).\n> \n> But if (2,6) is occupied by body, I can't move there unless it's the tail, but it's not.\n> \n> In this case, (2,6) is body, not tail.\n> \n> So I need to first make (2,6) free by moving the snake away.\n> \n> For example, if I move the head to the right or down, the snake might shift, and after several moves, (2,6) could be free.\n> \n> But let's see the current tail at (2,3), and the body is coiled, so it might take time.\n> \n> Perhaps I can move in a way that the snake uncoils or something.\n> \n> But there's a risk of colliding with walls or body.\n> \n> Another thing: the food at (1,6) can be eaten only if the head moves onto it, and at that time, the cell must be free, which it is, but to approach it, I need to be at (2,6) first.\n> \n> But (2,6) is occupied, so I need to wait until it is free.\n> \n> How many turns to free (2,6)?\n> \n> The segment at (2,6) is index 2. When the snake moves, this segment will move to the position of index 1, which is (3,6), so after one move, it is at (3,6), and (2,6) is occupied by the segment that was index 3, which was (2,5).\n> \n> After move to (4,5), as above, index 3 is (2,6), which was previously index 2.\n> \n> After another move, say from (4,5) to (5,5), new head (5,5), then body: (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (3,4), and tail (2,4)?

So the snake has 8 segments. Head is at (5,5), tail is at (3,4).\n> \n> **Snake Head Direction**: Currently D, which is down. But in coordinates, down decreases y, so moving down means (x, y-1). Let me confirm the coordinate system. Typically, in grids, (0,0) is top-left, y increases down, but here it says U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1).

That makes sense because if (0,0) is bottom, moving up increases y.\n> \n> In the snake positions: head at (5,5), then (5,6) – if y=6 is above y=5, so snake is going down from (5,6) to (5,5)? Positions are given head first: [(5,5), (5,6), ...] so head is at (5,5), next segment is (5,6). Since head is at (5,5) and previous position was (5,6), and current direction is D (down), which is (x,y-1), so from (5,6) to (5,5) is down, decreasing y, so y=5 is below y=6.

Life span is N turns.\n> \n> Perhaps the numbers are: for first food, x=1, y=6, value=6, life_span=1? But value 6 is not possible; it should be +1 or -1.\n> \n> Similarly, second: x=4, y=5, value=9, life_span=1? That can't be right.\n> \n> Maybe it's a mistake in the input. Let's see the text: \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value: - (1, 6, 6, 1) - (4, 5, 9, 1)\"\n> \n> But the description says: \" ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 ) \" so it should be three elements: position, value, life_span.\n> \n> Perhaps the input is misformatted. I think for (1,6,6,1), it might be (x=1,y=6), value=1, life_span=6? But it says \"6,1\" so life_span=6, value=1?\n> \n> Similarly, (4,5,9,1) could be (4,5), value=1, life_span=9? But it says \"9,1\", so life_span=9, value=1?\n> \n> But value is given as 1, which is +1, so positive food.\n> \n> Let me assume that: for each food, it's (x,y, life_span, value) but value is 1 for both, so positive food.\n> \n> In the text, it's \" (1, 6, 6, 1) \" and \" (4, 5, 9, 1) \", and since value is 1 for both, it means positive food with value +1.\n> \n> Life span: for (1,6) it's 6 turns, for (4,5) it's 9 turns.\n> \n> Value is +1 for both.\n> \n> Also, life span decreases every turn, including current turn, so on turn 26, life span 6 means it will disappear after 6 more turns, so on turn 32? Life span decreases every turn, so if life span is N, it disappears after N turns, meaning after N moves including this one.\n> \n> Life span: if life_span = L on turn t, it will disappear at the end of turn t + L - 1 or something. Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So if life_span is N on turn t, after this turn, it decreases to N-1, and so on, until it reaches 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten on turns when life_span >=1.\n> \n> For example, food at (1,6) with life_span=6 on turn 26, so it will be there for turns 26,27,28,29,30,31, and disappear before turn 32.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,5) with life_span=9 on turn 26, will be there until turn 34.\n> \n> Both are positive food, value +1.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (5,5), direction D (down, so (x,y-1)).\n> \n> Current direction is D, so from previous move, it came from (5,6) to (5,5) by moving down.\n> \n> Now, possible moves: since direction is D, I can move L, R, or D, but not U because that would be instant reverse? \"No instant reverse\": cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\n> \n> Current direction is D (down), so opposite is U (up).

occupied by segment 4 now.\n> \n> After one move with no eat, segment 4 moves to where segment 3 was, so (2,6) is now occupied by the new segment that moved there, but the cell (2,6) may be free if no segment moves to it.\n> \n> When the snake moves, each segment moves to a new cell, so the cell (2,6) might be left empty if no segment moves into it.\n> \n> In this case, segment 4 is at (2,6), and it will move to the position of segment 3, which is (3,6), so after the move, segment 4 is at (3,6), and (2,6) is empty if no other segment moves to it.\n> \n> Similarly, the new head is at new position, etc.\n> \n> For example, on turn 26, if I move the head to (5,4), then new positions: head (5,4), then body: old head (5,5) at position 1, (5,6) at 2, (4,6) at 3, (3,6) at 4, (2,6) at 5, (2,5) at 6, (3,5) at 7, and tail (3,4) removed.\n> \n> So after move, position 4 is at (3,6), position 5 at (2,6), etc. (2,6) is still occupied by position 5.\n> \n> Similarly, after another move, position 5 will move to where position 4 was, and so on.\n> \n> To free (2,6), I need that no segment is assigned to it after the move, which happens when the segment that was there moves away and no other segment comes.\n> \n> In this case, since the snake is connected, (2,6) will be occupied until the tail passes through it.\n> \n> The tail is currently at (3,4), and to reach (2,6), it needs to

It's turn 27. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7). Internal obstacles are at (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4). Snake positions: head at (5,4), then body segments at (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5). So the snake is 8 segments long. Head direction is D (down), meaning it moved down to reach (5,4).\n> \n> Food: two items. One at (1,6) with value 1 and life span 5. Another at (4,5) with value 1 and life span 8. Both are positive food since value is +1.\n> \n> I need to plan an action sequence for at least 5 turns ahead, from turn 27 to turn 31 or more, to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n> \n> First, let's sketch the grid to visualize.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n> \n> Walls: borders are walls, so cells where x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Also internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4).\n> \n> List obstacles:\n> \n> - (5,2)\n> \n> - (4,4)\n> \n> - (1,2)\n> \n> - (1,5)\n> \n> - (1,4)\n> \n> (1,4) and (1,5) are both obstacles, and (1,2). So column x=1 has obstacles at y=2,4,5.\n> \n> Snake positions:\n> \n> Head: (5,4)\n> \n> Body: (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5)\n> \n> So let's list coordinates:\n> \n> - Segment 0 (head): (5,4)\n> \n> - Segment 1: (5,5)\n> \n> - Segment 2: (5,6)\n> \n> - Segment 3: (4,6)\n> \n> - Segment 4: (3,6)\n> \n> - Segment 5: (2,6)\n> \n> - Segment 6: (2,5)\n> \n> - Segment 7 (tail): (3,5)\n> \n> Head direction is D, down. Since head is at (5,4) and direction is D, it must have come from above, so previous head was at (5,5) or something? Positions are given with head first, so from the list, before moving, head was at (5,5) but it moved down to (5,4)? Let's see the sequence.\n> \n> The positions are current positions at turn 27. Head is at (5,4), and it says head direction is D, meaning the last move was down to (5,4). So before that, head was at (5,5), which is now the first body segment.\n> \n> In the positions list, index 0 is head, index 1 is the segment that was head before, and so on.\n> \n> So at turn 27, after moving down, head is at (5,4), which was previously empty or something, but now occupied.\n> \n> Now, possible moves from (5,4): since head direction is D (down), I can't do instant reverse, so I cannot move up (U) because that would be opposite to down. Allowed moves are left (L), right (R), or continue down (D). But I need to check where I can move without hitting walls or body.\n> \n> Current position: (5,4)\n> \n> Move options:\n> \n> - Up (U): to (5,5) but that's where segment 1 is, which is a body segment. Is that a collision?\n> \n> Body collision: head touches any body segment except the tail, but when moving, if head moves to a cell that will be occupied by a body segment after the move, it might be a collision.\n> \n> Standard snake rules: after moving, if the head is in the same cell as any body segment, it's a collision, except that the tail is moving away, so if head moves to where the tail was, and tail moves, it's ok only if it's the very end.\n> \n> Rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, when moving, the head moves to a new cell, then the body follows, so the tail cell becomes empty if it moves.\n> \n> Specifically: if head moves to a cell that is currently occupied by the tail, and after moving, the tail moves forward, so that cell is no longer occupied, so it's safe. But if it's occupied by any other body segment, it's a collision because that segment doesn't move away immediately.\n> \n> In this case, from (5,4), moving:\n> \n> - Up (U) to (5,5): (5,5) is currently occupied by segment 1. After move, head moves to (5,5), but segment 1 will move to where? The body shifts: the new head position is (5,5), then segment 1 moves to where segment 2 was? No.\n> \n> After moving, the head goes to the new position, then each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment. So the tail segment leaves its position.\n> \n> Specifically: if head moves to a cell that is the current position of the tail, then after moving, the tail moves, so that cell is free. But if head moves to a cell that is occupied by a non-tail body segment, that segment will still be there after the move, so head collides with it.\n> \n> Similarly, if head moves to a wall, collision.\n> \n> Also, if head moves to a cell with food, it eats it, and the snake grows, so tail doesn't move that turn.\n> \n> But let's first list possible moves from (5,4) without considering food.\n> \n> Current adjacent cells:\n> \n> - North: (5,5) - occupied by segment 1 (body)\n> \n> - South: (5,3) - is this within bounds? y=3, x=5, not a border? Borders are x=0,x=7,y=0,y=7, so (5,3) is within 1 to 6? x=5, y=3, min x=0, max x=7, min y=0, max y=7, so (5,3) is valid, no wall mentioned, and not an obstacle? Internal obstacles are (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4). (5,2) is an obstacle, but (5,3) is not listed, so it should be free.\n> \n> - East: (6,4) - x=6, y=4, not border? x=6 <7, y=4, not 0 or 7, and not in obstacles, so free.\n> \n> - West: (4,4) - (4,4) is an internal obstacle! Listed as (4,4) in obstacles.\n> \n> Obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4). So (4,4) is an obstacle, so cannot move there.\n> \n> Also, (5,5) is occupied by body segment 1.\n> \n> So possible moves:\n> \n> - South (D) to (5,3): this is down, same as current direction? Current head direction is D, so moving D is allowed, not reverse.\n> \n> - East (R) to (6,4)\n> \n> - Up (U) to (5,5) is occupied by body, not tail, so collision.\n> \n> - West (L) to (4,4) is obstacle, not possible.\n> \n> So only possible moves are South (D) to (5,3) or East (R) to (6,4).\n> \n> Now, there is food at (4,5) and (1,6).\n> \n> (4,5): value 1, life span 8\n> \n> (1,6): value 1, life span 5\n> \n> Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 27, food at (1,6) has life span 5, meaning it will disappear after 5 turns, so on turn 32 it will be gone? Let's see: life span N, disappears after N turns, countdown decreases each turn including current.\n> \n> So at turn t, if life span is L, it will disappear at the end of turn t + L - 1? Example: if at turn t, life span is 1, it disappears after this turn, so if not eaten this turn, it's gone.\n> \n> Rule: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So for food at (1,6), life span 5 at turn 27. After turn 27, life span becomes 4, then 3,2,1, and after turn 31, it disappears? Let's clarify.\n> \n> If countdown decreases every turn including current, at turn 27, life span is 5. After turn 27 is executed, life span decreases to 4. Similarly, after turn 28, to 3, and so on, until after turn 31, it decreases to 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten on turns 27 to 31 inclusive, and disappears before turn 32.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (4,5) life span 8 at turn 27, so can be eaten from turn 27 to turn 34 (since 27+7=34, after 34 it disappears before turn 35? Let's calculate:\n> \n> - Turn 27: life span 5, can be eaten\n> \n> - After turn 27: life span 4\n> \n> - After turn 28: 3\n> \n> - After turn 29: 2\n> \n> - After turn 30: 1\n> \n> - After turn 31: 0, disappears, so cannot be eaten on turn 32 or later.\n> \n> Similarly for life span 8: after turn 27:7, 28:6, ..., after turn 34:0, disappears before turn 35.\n> \n> Now, back to moves.\n> \n> From (5,4), I can move D to (5,3) or R to (6,4).\n> \n> If I move D to (5,3), is there food? (5,3) has no food, so just move, no eat.\n> \n> Then the snake moves to (5,3), head, then body segments shift: segment 1 moves to (5,4), which was head, segment 2 to (5,5), etc., tail (3,5) moves to (2,5)? Positions after move: head at (5,3), then body: (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5). Tail was (3,5), which moves to where segment 6 was? Segment 7 was (3,5), which is tail, and after move, it moves to the position of segment 6, which is (2,5). But (2,5) is occupied by segment 6? Current positions: let's list indices.\n> \n> Current positions:\n> \n> - Head: (5,4) idx0\n> \n> - idx1: (5,5)\n> \n> - idx2: (5,6)\n> \n> - idx3: (4,6)\n> \n> - idx4: (3,6)\n> \n> - idx5: (2,6)\n> \n> - idx6: (2,5)\n> \n> - idx7: (3,5) tail\n> \n> After moving head to (5,3), no eat, so tail moves off.\n> \n> New positions: head at (5,3)\n> \n> Then idx1 moves to where head was: (5,4)\n> \n> idx2 moves to where idx1 was: (5,5)\n> \n> idx3 to idx2: (5,6)\n> \n> idx4 to idx3: (4,6)\n> \n> idx5 to idx4: (3,6)\n> \n> idx6 to idx5: (2,6)\n> \n> idx7 (tail) to where idx6 was: (2,5)\n> \n> But idx6 was at (2,5), so tail moves to (2,5), but (2,5) was occupied, but since tail moves there, and idx6 moves to (2,6), it should be fine.

Let's see the positions: snake has (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), etc. (4,5) is not in snake positions, and not obstacle except (4,4) is obstacle, but (4,5) is different.\n> \n> Obstacles: (4,4) is obstacle, but (4,5) is not listed as obstacle, so it should be free, and has food.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,6) has food.\n> \n> (1,6) is not occupied by snake? Snake has (2,6), (3,6), etc., (1,6) is adjacent? But not occupied.\n> \n> Special case: food can spawn under snake body, but here (4,5) and (1,6) are not under body currently?

No, not occupied.\n> \n> Now, if I want to eat (4,5), I need to move to it.\n> \n> From (5,4), (4,5) is west and north? (5,4) to (4,5) is northwest, not adjacent directly. Adjacent cells are only up, down, left, right, no diagonal.\n> \n> So to reach (4,5) from (5,4), I need to move to adjacent cells first.\n> \n> Possible paths.\n> \n> First, I need to plan multiple moves.\n> \n> Since I must think 5+ turns ahead, I should consider sequences to eat food while avoiding death.\n> \n> Also, tail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> Current tail is at (3,5), and it has no food, I think. Food is at (1,6) and (4,5), not on tail.\n> \n> But when moving, tail moves.\n> \n> Let's think about the food at (4,5).

So only U or D.\n> \n> Similarly, if I move to (5,3) from start, then from (5,3), I can move to (5,2), but (5,2) is obstacle! Internal obstacle at (5,2), so cannot move there.

It's turn 28, and I'm playing Snake on a 7x7 grid, since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think? Let me confirm.\n> \n> The grid goes from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7, but walls are at these borders, so cells like (0,y) and (7,y) for all y, and (x,0), (x,7) for all x are walls. Internal obstacles are given: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4). So the snake can only move within x=1 to x=6 and y=1 to y=6, except where obstacles are.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (5,3), then (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5). So that's 8 segments. Head direction is D, which is down, meaning it was moving down to (5,3) from (5,4)? Let's list the positions in order:\n> \n> - Head: (5,3)\n> \n> - Next: (5,4)  // this is above, so if head is at (5,3) and direction is D, down, that means it moved down to (5,3), so previous position was (5,4)? Positions are given as [(x0,y0), (x1,y1), ...] with head first. So (5,3) is head, then (5,4) is the first body segment, which is north of head? Coordinates: (5,3) and (5,4), if y increases up, then (5,4) has higher y, so it's above (5,3). But direction is D, down, which is decreasing y? I need to know the coordinate system.\n> \n> Typically in such grids, y=0 is bottom or top? The state says: U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), so y increases upward? Let's see:\n> \n> U: (x, y+1) — so y increases upward.\n> \n> D: (x, y-1) — y decreases downward.\n> \n> L: (x-1, y) — x decreases left.\n> \n> R: (x+1, y) — x increases right.\n> \n> So for head at (5,3), with direction D (down), meaning it came from (5,4) to (5,3), since down decreases y.\n> \n> Body segments: after head (5,3), it's (5,4), then (5,5), then (5,6), then (4,6), then (3,6), then (2,6), then (2,5).

Turn 28 current, life span 4, so it disappears after 4 turns, so on turn 29,30,31,32 it exists, but after turn 32 it's gone? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn t, if life span is L, it exists for this turn and the next L-1 turns? Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span).

Let me confirm the grid size.\n> \n> Walls: Border cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. That means the grid is from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7, but since walls occupy these, the snake can only be on cells where 1 <= x <= 6 and 1 <= y <= 6. Internal obstacles are given: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4). So these cells are blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions: Head is at (4,3), then body: (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6). So the snake has 8 segments. Head direction is left (L), meaning it was moving left to get to (4,3) from previous position.\n> \n> Food:\n> \n> - (1,6) with life span 3, value 1 (positive food)\n> \n> - (4,5) with life span 6, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (6,4) with life span 9, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> All food is positive, no negative food here.

(1,6) is a food position, not listed as obstacle, so it should be accessible, but (1,4) and (1,5) are obstacles, so to reach (1,6), I need to come from above or below, but y=6 is the top row? y=0 bottom, y=7 top? Typically in grids, y=0 might be bottom or top; I need to clarify.\n> \n> In the movement, U is (x,y+1), so increasing y moves up, so y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top.

(4,2) is not listed, so it should be free.\n> \n> - Left: (3,3) - this should be free, no obstacle mentioned, and not occupied by snake?

So (3,3) is not occupied, and not obstacle, so can move left.\n> \n> - Right: (5,3) - but (5,3) is the second segment of the snake, so moving right would cause collision with body, since head touches body segment immediately.

At turn t, if food has life span L, it will be there for L more turns, including turn t, so it disappears at turn t + L.\n> \n> For example, at turn t, life span L, after turn t, it has L-1 left, and so on, until life span 0, then disappears.

The grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so cells go from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are at the borders, so playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6)? Let me confirm.\n> \n> Walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. That means the grid has cells from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7, but moving to any cell with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 is a wall collision. Similarly, internal obstacles are given: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4). So these are also deadly.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (3,4), then body segments: (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6). So that's 8 segments.

It's turn 32, and I'm playing Snake on a grid with walls and obstacles. The grid seems to be from (0,0) to (7,7) since border walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. There are also internal obstacles at (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4). That means I can't move to these cells.\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (3,5), and the body follows: (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6). Head direction is Up, which means last move was Up, so from (3,4) to (3,5).\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (4,5) with life span 4, value +1 (since it says \"1\" and from context, positive food has value 1)\n> \n> - (6,4) with life span 6, value +1\n> \n> - (4,1) with life span 9, value +1\n> \n> All food seems to be positive, no negative food mentioned. Value is 1 for all, so they add length.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan an action sequence for at least 5 turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks. Prioritize long-term survival over immediate rewards.\n> \n> First, let's sketch the grid to visualize. I'll make a simple grid.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n> \n> Walls: borders, so all cells where x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. Also internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4).\n> \n> (1,4) and (1,5) are obstacles, and (1,2). So row y=1 has obstacles at x=1,4,5? (1,2), (1,4), (1,5) – that's three points.\n> \n> List obstacles clearly:\n> \n> - (5,2)\n> \n> - (4,4)\n> \n> - (1,2)\n> \n> - (1,5)\n> \n> - (1,4)\n> \n> (1,4) and (1,5) are separate points.\n> \n> Snake positions: head (3,5), then (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6). So the snake is 8 segments long.\n> \n> Head at (3,5), which is y=5, and since head direction is U, it came from (3,4) to (3,5), so moving up.\n> \n> From the positions: (3,5) head, (3,4), (3,3), then to (4,3), so it turned left or something? From (3,3) to (4,3) is right, then (5,3) right, (5,4) up, (5,5) up, (5,6) up. So the tail is at (5,6).\n> \n> Food:\n> \n> - (4,5) life span 4, value 1\n> \n> - (6,4) life span 6, value 1\n> \n> - (4,1) life span 9, value 1\n> \n> Life span decreases every turn, including current, so on turn 32, life span 4 means it disappears after 4 more turns? Let's see the rule: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So for food at (4,5) with life span 4 on turn 32, it will disappear at the end of turn 35? Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" so on turn t when it's present, life span L, after one turn (t+1), life span is L-1, and so on, until life span 0, then it disappears before the next turn.\n> \n> Rule: \"Disappears after N turns\" – I think it means it will be there for N turns, including the current one if it's spawned.\n> \n> But \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" – so if at turn t, life span is L, then on turn t, after the snake moves, the countdown decreases? I need to be careful.\n> \n> The state says \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value\" at current turn, so for turn 32, life span 4 for (4,5) means it has 4 turns left, including turn 32. So after 4 turns, it will disappear. Similarly for others.\n> \n> For (4,5), life span 4 on turn 32, so it will disappear after turn 35 (since turns: 32,33,34,35 – 4 turns, gone at turn 36).\n> \n> Similarly, (6,4) life span 6, disappears after turn 37.\n> \n> (4,1) life span 9, disappears after turn 40.\n> \n> Now, head is at (3,5), direction U. Possible moves: since head direction is U, I can move U, L, or R, but not D because that would be instant reverse. Rule: \"no instant reverse\", so from U, I can go U, L, R, but not D.\n> \n> Current head direction is U, so next move cannot be D.\n> \n> Possible actions: U, L, R.\n> \n> Now, let's see the surrounding cells.\n> \n> Head at (3,5):\n> \n> - Up (U): (3,6) – is this valid? y=6, grid y=0 to 7, so y=6 is not border? Borders are y=0 and y=7, so y=6 is within bounds. Check obstacles: internal obstacles, (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4) – (3,6) not in list, so free? But walls include borders, and internal obstacles. (3,6) x=3,y=6, not border (since x=0 or7, y=0 or7 are borders, y=6<7), and not internal obstacle, so should be free, but is it occupied by snake?\n> \n> Snake positions: (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6) – (5,6) is tail. (3,6) is not in snake positions, so free.\n> \n> - Left (L): (2,5) – x=2,y=5. Borders: x=0 or7, y=0 or7, so (2,5) not border. Internal obstacles not there, snake? Snake has (3,5), (5,5), etc., not (2,5), so free.\n> \n> - Right (R): (4,5) – but (4,5) has food! And it's a cell. Is it occupied? (4,5) is a food position, but is it free to move? Snake is not on it, except if it was under body, but here it's not occupied by snake currently.\n> \n> Snake positions: (3,5), (3,4), etc., no (4,5), so (4,5) is free and has food.\n> \n> But moving to (4,5) would eat the food, since head moves onto it.\n> \n> Also, down (D) is not possible because reverse.\n> \n> So from (3,5), possible moves:\n> \n> - U to (3,6)\n> \n> - L to (2,5)\n> \n> - R to (4,5) which has food.\n> \n> Now, if I move R to (4,5), I eat the food, so length increases by 1, and I get +1 score. But I need to consider the risks.\n> \n> First, after moving, the snake grows, so new head at (4,5), and tail stays or moves? When you eat food, the tail doesn't move that turn, so the snake grows by one segment.\n> \n> Rule: \"Length of snake +1\" when eating positive food.\n> \n> So if I eat at turn 32, head moves to (4,5), which was food, so now snake positions: new head (4,5), then previous head (3,5) becomes body, so body segments: (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6). Since I ate, tail doesn't move, so the segment that was tail stays, so snake becomes 9 segments: head (4,5), then (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6). (5,6) is still there.\n> \n> Now, is there any danger? Tail is at (5,6), head is at (4,5). Are they adjacent? (4,5) and (5,6) are not adjacent; adjacent would be same x or y, diff by 1. (4,5) to (5,6) is diagonal, not adjacent. So no tail reward danger here.\n> \n> Also, no collision immediately.\n> \n> But let's think about future moves.\n> \n> I need to plan 5 turns ahead.\n> \n> Also, food at (4,5) has life span 4, so if I don't eat it now, it might disappear soon, but since life span 4, it has until turn 35, so I can eat it later, but need to be careful.\n> \n> Similarly, other food.\n> \n> But let's think strategically.\n> \n> The grid has obstacles, so I need to navigate.\n> \n> First, let's list all free cells or something.\n> \n> Perhaps I should consider the available space.\n> \n> Since the snake is long, 8 segments, and grid is 8x8, but with walls and obstacles, the playable area is smaller.\n> \n> Total cells: 8x8 = 64 cells.\n> \n> Border walls: all cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, so that's 32 cells? No.\n> \n> For x=0, y from 0 to 7: 8 cells\n> \n> x=7, y 0-7: 8 cells\n> \n> y=0, x 1-6: 6 cells (since corners already counted)\n> \n> y=7, x 1-6: 6 cells\n> \n> Total border walls: 8 + 8 + 6 + 6 = 28 cells? Let's calculate:\n> \n> Corners: (0,0), (0,7), (7,0), (7,7) are counted in both x and y, so better: for rows y=0 and y=7, all x from 0 to 7 are walls, that's 16 cells.\n> \n> For columns x=0 and x=7, but y=1 to 6, since y=0 and y=7 already included. So x=0, y=1 to 6: 6 cells, similarly x=7, y=1 to 6: 6 cells.\n> \n> Total border walls: 16 (top and bottom) + 12 (sides without corners) = 28 cells? 16 + 12 = 28, but 8x8=64, 64-28=36 cells not border, but internal cells can have obstacles.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4) – that's 5 cells.\n> \n> Also, snake occupies 8 cells, but some might be on border? Snake positions: (3,5) to (5,6), all x=3,4,5 y=3,4,5,6, all internal, not border.\n> \n> Border walls are cells, so playable cells are not wall cells.\n> \n> Playable area: all cells not wall and not obstacle.\n> \n> Wall cells include borders and internal obstacles? No, walls are specified separately: \"Cells occupied by walls\" including border cells and internal obstacles.\n> \n> In input: \"Cells occupied by walls: - Border Cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7. - Internal Obstacles: [(5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4)]\"\n> \n> So wall cells are all these: border cells plus internal obstacles.\n> \n> Number of wall cells: border cells - as above, for 8x8 grid, number of border cells: top row y=0: 8 cells, bottom row y=7: 8 cells, left column x=0 y=1 to 6: 6 cells, right column x=7 y=1 to 6: 6 cells, total 8+8+6+6=28.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: 5 cells, so total wall cells: 28 + 5 = 33.\n> \n> Total cells: 64, so free cells: 64 - 33 = 31.\n> \n> But snake occupies 8 of them, so currently 23 free cells.\n> \n> Food on 3 cells, so 20 empty cells.\n> \n> Now, back to decision.\n> \n> At turn 32, head at (3,5), direction U.\n> \n> Options:\n> \n> - Move R to (4,5): eat food, grow to 9 segments. Then head at (4,5).\n> \n> After eating, what can I do? From (4,5), possible moves: U to (4,6), D to (4,4), L to (3,5), R to (5,5).\n> \n> But (3,5) is now body, since snake is (4,5) head, then (3,5) body, so moving L to (3,5) would collide with body, death.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,5) is body? Current snake after move: if I move R to (4,5), snake: head (4,5), body: (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6).\n> \n> So (5,5) is a body segment, so moving R to (5,5) from (4,5) would be collision.\n> \n> Moving D to (4,4): (4,4) is an internal obstacle! (4,4) is in internal obstacles list, so it's a wall, cannot move there.\n> \n> Moving U to (4,6): (4,6) is not wall, not snake, free.\n> \n> (4,6) y=6, x=4, not border, not internal obstacle (obstacles are (5,2),(4,4),(1,2),(1,5),(1,4)), so (4,6) free.\n> \n> Also, no food there.\n> \n> So from (4,5) after eating, only possible move is U to (4,6), since D is wall, L is body, R is body.\n> \n> L is (3,5) body, R is (5,5) body, D is (4,4) wall, so only U is possible.\n> \n> Then to (4,6).\n> \n> Now, from (4,6), what can I do? Direction would be U, since I moved U from (4,5).\n> \n> Then possible moves: U to (4,7), but y=7 is border wall, cannot move there.\n> \n> D to (4,5), but that's where I came from, and it's now body? After moving to (4,6), the snake: head (4,6), then (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), etc., tail still (5,6) or moved?\n> \n> When I move, the tail moves unless I eat food.\n> \n> At turn 32, if I move R to (4,5) and eat, then turn 33, I move U to (4,6), no eat, so tail moves: the last segment (5,6) is removed, so snake: head (4,6), then (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5). Length 9, but after move without eating, tail moves, so from 9 segments, after move, head to new position, tail removed, so back to 8 segments? No.\n> \n> When you eat food, snake grows, so after eating at turn 32, snake has 9 segments: positions from head to tail: (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6).\n> \n> At turn 33, if I move to (4,6) without eating, then new head (4,6), add to front, tail (5,6) removed, so snake: (4,6), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5).

After growth to 9, then when moving without eating, tail moves, so it should be 8 segments.\n> \n> Initial snake length 8.\n> \n> Turn 32: move to (4,5) and eat, so snake grows to 9 segments.\n> \n> Turn 33: move to (4,6), no food there, so tail moves: remove the last segment, which was (5,6), so now snake: head (4,6), then body: (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), and (5,5) is now the last?

It's turn 33, and I'm playing Snake on a 7x7 grid? The walls are defined by borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the grid is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think, since x=0 and x=7 are walls, so playable area is x=1 to x=6, y=1 to y=6? Let me confirm.\n> \n> The walls include border cells: x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7, so that means the grid boundaries are walls. Also, internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4). So playable cells are from (1,1) to (6,6), but excluding the obstacles.\n> \n> Now, snake positions: head at (3,6), then (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5). So the snake has 8 segments. Head direction is U, which is up, so currently moving upwards.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (4,5) with life span 3, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (6,4) with life span 5, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (4,1) with life span 8, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> All food is positive, no negative food here. Value 1 for all, so each gives +1 score and increases length by 1 when eaten.\n> \n> Life span: for (4,5), life span 3, meaning it disappears after 3 turns including current, so if not eaten by turn 35, it's gone? Life span decreases every turn, including current turn. So at turn 33, life span 3 means it has 3 turns left: turns 33, 34, 35. After turn 35, it disappears. Similarly, (6,4) life span 5, so turns 33 to 37, and (4,1) life span 8, turns 33 to 40.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan an action sequence for at least 5 turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n> \n> First, let's map the grid. I'll sketch a 6x6 grid from (1,1) to (6,6).\n> \n> List obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4). So:\n> \n> - (1,2) obstacle\n> \n> - (1,4) obstacle\n> \n> - (1,5) obstacle\n> \n> - (4,4) obstacle\n> \n> - (5,2) obstacle\n> \n> Snake: head (3,6), body: (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5). So tail is at (5,5).\n> \n> Head direction U, so moving up.\n> \n> Current position: head at (3,6). Since direction is U, and grid y=6 is top? Walls at y=0 and y=7, so y=1 bottom, y=6 top, I assume. Usually in grids, y increases upwards, but in coordinates, it might be different. The movement: U is (x,y+1), so y+1 is up, meaning higher y is up. So y=1 is bottom, y=6 is top.\n> \n> Confirm: U (x,y+1) — so if current position (3,6), moving U would be to (3,7), but y=7 is wall, so moving up from (3,6) is invalid because (3,7) is wall. Oh, problem.\n> \n> Head at (3,6), direction U, but (3,6) is at y=6, and y=7 is wall, so moving up to (3,7) is impossible. But the snake is at (3,6) with direction U, so it must have moved there from below, like from (3,5) to (3,6) on previous turn. But now, from (3,6), moving U is not possible because wall. So I need to change direction.\n> \n> Available moves from (3,6):\n> \n> - U: (3,7) — y=7 is wall, invalid\n> \n> - D: (3,5) — but (3,5) is currently occupied by the snake body, the second segment.\n> \n> But according to rules, moving into body segments is deadly, except for the tail, because tail will move away.\n> \n> Snake positions: [(3,6), (3,5), (3,4), ...] so (3,5) is the body segment just behind head.\n> \n> If I move D to (3,5), that would be head colliding with body, which is deadly.\n> \n> Similarly, L: (2,6) — is that valid? x=2,y=6.\n> \n> First, walls: x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6. (2,6) should be within bounds, no obstacle? Obstacles are (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,4), (1,5). (1,4) and (1,5) are obstacles, but (2,6) is not listed, so it should be free.\n> \n> Similarly, R: (4,6) — should be free.\n> \n> D: (3,5) is occupied by snake body.\n> \n> U: invalid, wall.\n> \n> So possible moves: L to (2,6) or R to (4,6).\n> \n> Now, head direction is U, but since I can't move U, I have to choose L or R. Also, no instant reverse, but reverse would be D, which is not possible anyway, since it's occupied.\n> \n> Reverse from U would be D, but D is not a valid move because of body, so only L and R are possible.\n> \n> I need to think ahead.\n> \n> Food locations:\n> \n> - (4,5) — this is at x=4,y=5, which is one cell down from head? Head at (3,6), so (4,5) is southeast? (3,6) to (4,5) is down-right, but not adjacent directly.\n> \n> Adjacent cells: from (3,6), adjacent are (3,5) down, (3,7) up invalid, (2,6) left, (4,6) right.\n> \n> (4,5) is not adjacent to (3,6); it's at (4,5), which is one down and one right from head, but not directly accessible in one move.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,4) is at x=6,y=4, and (4,1) at x=4,y=1.\n> \n> Now, life spans: (4,5) has life span 3, so must be eaten by turn 35 (turns 33,34,35).\n> \n> (6,4) life span 5, by turn 37.\n> \n> (4,1) life span 8, by turn 40.\n> \n> Since I need to maximize score, I should try to eat all if possible, but with survival first.\n> \n> But (4,5) is close and will disappear soon, so maybe prioritize that.\n> \n> But let's see the path.\n> \n> First, from head (3,6), I can go L to (2,6) or R to (4,6).\n> \n> If I go R to (4,6), then I'm at (4,6). From there, I can go to (4,5), which has food, but (4,5) is currently occupied? No, food is at (4,5), but is it under the snake?\n> \n> Snake positions: [(3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5)] — so (4,5) is not in snake positions, so it should be free. But let's confirm: (4,5) is listed in food, and not in snake, so yes, free cell.\n> \n> Similarly, obstacles: (4,4) is obstacle, so (4,5) is not obstacle.\n> \n> So from (4,6), I can go D to (4,5) to eat the food.\n> \n> But when I eat food, snake grows, so after eating, the tail doesn't move, so the new segment is added at head, but the tail stays until next move.\n> \n> Now, there's a special case: Tail Reward Danger. If head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills.\n> \n> Here, tail is at (5,5). Head is at (3,6), which is not adjacent to (5,5). Adjacent means sharing edge, so (3,6) and (5,5) are not adjacent; they are diagonal or something. (3,6) to (5,5) is two steps away.\n> \n> So no issue.\n> \n> Now, if I move to (4,6) on turn 33, then to (4,5) on turn 34, I can eat the food.\n> \n> But on turn 33, if I move to (4,6), that's fine.\n> \n> Then turn 34, move D to (4,5), eat food, snake grows, so new head at (4,5), and tail stays at (5,5) for now? When you eat, on the turn you move to food, you grow, so the segment is added immediately, but the tail doesn't move that turn. Standard snake mechanics.\n> \n> After eating, the snake length increases, so the tail remains in place until the next move.\n> \n> But in terms of positions, when head moves to food, it consumes it, and the new head is there, and since length increases, the tail doesn't advance, so the body stays.\n> \n> But for collision, it should be fine.\n> \n> Now, after eating at (4,5), head is at (4,5), and body includes the previous positions.\n> \n> But let's think about the path.\n> \n> First, turn 33: action.\n> \n> Options: L to (2,6) or R to (4,6).\n> \n> If I go R to (4,6), then turn 34: from (4,6), I can go D to (4,5) to eat food.\n> \n> (4,5) has life span 3, so on turn 34, it will have life span 2 left, but since I eat it on turn 34, it's fine.\n> \n> Life span decreases each turn, including current, so at turn 33, life span 3, after turn 33, if not eaten, life span becomes 2, and so on.\n> \n> But when I move to it, I eat it.\n> \n> So on turn 34, if I move to (4,5), I eat it when life span is still valid.\n> \n> Similarly, other food.\n> \n> But I need to think 5 turns ahead.\n> \n> Also, after eating, I need to avoid collisions.\n> \n> Moreover, there might be risks.\n> \n> Another thing: the food at (4,5) might be under snake? No, snake is at (3,6), (3,5), etc., not at (4,5), so it's free.\n> \n> But let's confirm the grid.\n> \n> Grid cells: for example, (4,5) is empty, except for food.\n> \n> Now, obstacles: (4,4) is obstacle, so (4,5) is adjacent to obstacle, but not blocked.\n> \n> From (4,5), after eating, where can I go?\n> \n> Possible moves from (4,5): U to (4,6), but (4,6) is where I came from? On turn 34, after moving to (4,5), head at (4,5), and previous head was (4,6), so body includes (4,6) now.\n> \n> After turn 34: if I start turn 33 at (3,6), move R to (4,6) on turn 33.\n> \n> Then turn 34, move D to (4,5), eat food.\n> \n> Now snake positions: before move, turn 33 start: head (3,6), body (3,5) to (5,5)\n> \n> After move R to (4,6): new head (4,6), body: (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5) — tail (5,5)\n> \n> Then turn 34, move D to (4,5): since I eat food, new head (4,5), and I add a segment, so body becomes: (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), and tail (5,5) stays? No.\n> \n> When you eat, on the move to food, head moves to food, and since food is eaten, length increases, so the tail does not move; it stays in place.

On turn 33, when I moved to (4,6), I didn't eat food, so snake moved, head to (4,6), tail from (5,5) moved to where?

It's turn 34, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since the borders are from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7. Walls include the borders and internal obstacles at (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), and (1,4). I need to avoid these.\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (4,6), with body segments following: (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4). So the snake is 8 segments long. Head direction is right (R), meaning it was moving right to get to (4,6) from (3,6).\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (4,5) with value 1, life span 2. This means it disappears after 2 turns, including the current turn, so after turn 35 it might be gone? Life span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 34, life span is 2, meaning it will disappear after turn 35 if not eaten. Life span: after N turns it disappears. So if life span is 2 at turn 34, it will be there for turn 34 and 35, and disappear after turn 35, so not available on turn 36.\n> \n> - (6,4) with value 1, life span 4. Available for turns 34,35,36,37, gone after turn 37.\n> \n> - (4,1) with value 1, life span 7. Available for turns 34 to 40.\n> \n> - (2,2) with value 1, life span 10. Available for turns 34 to 43.\n> \n> All food is positive, value +1, so no negative food here. That's good.\n> \n> I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks. Prioritize long-term survival over immediate rewards.\n> \n> Current head position: (4,6). Head direction is R, so last move was right. Therefore, I cannot move left instantly because of no instant reverse. So possible moves from (4,6) are U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), R (right, x+1), but not L (left, x-1) because that would be opposite to current direction.\n> \n> Current direction is R, so moving left would be reverse, which is not allowed. So from (4,6), possible moves:\n> \n> - U: to (4,7) - but y=7 is border wall, so that's invalid, collision.\n> \n> - D: to (4,5)\n> \n> - R: to (5,6)\n> \n> - L: to (3,6) - but (3,6) is occupied by the body segment, but it's the second segment? Let's see snake positions: head (4,6), then (3,6), which is the neck, then (3,5), etc.\n> \n> When the snake moves, the tail moves, so moving to (3,6) might be possible because the tail will move away. But I need to check for collisions.\n> \n> Deadly collisions: body collision except for the tail cell. Since the tail moves, if I move to a cell that will be vacated by the tail, it's safe. But if I move to a cell occupied by any body segment except the tail, it's collision.\n> \n> In this case, (3,6) is the second segment, not the tail. Tail is at (5,4). So moving to (3,6) would be moving into a body segment, which is collision, deadly.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,6) - is that a wall or free? Walls: borders x=0,x=7,y=0,y=7, and internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4). So (5,6) is not a wall, and not occupied by snake? Snake positions: (4,6),(3,6),(3,5),(3,4),(3,3),(4,3),(5,3),(5,4). So (5,6) is empty, I think.\n> \n> Let me list all occupied cells: snake occupies: (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4). Walls: (0,y) for all y, (7,y) for all y, (x,0) for all x, (x,7) for all x, and (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4).\n> \n> (4,4) is a wall, which is internal obstacle.\n> \n> Now, possible moves from head (4,6):\n> \n> - U: (4,7) - y=7 is border wall, so invalid.\n> \n> - D: (4,5) - is this free? (4,5) is not in snake positions, not a wall. Walls: (4,4) is wall, but (4,5) is not listed as wall. Borders are x=0,7 or y=0,7, so (4,5) is inside. Internal obstacles are (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4). (4,4) is wall, but (4,5) is not, so it should be free. Also, food is at (4,5), with life span 2.\n> \n> - R: (5,6) - not wall, not snake, should be free.\n> \n> - L: (3,6) - occupied by snake body (second segment), so collision, invalid.\n> \n> So only possible moves: D to (4,5) or R to (5,6).\n> \n> Now, moving to (4,5) would eat the food there, since food is present. Value +1, snake length increases by 1.\n> \n> But I need to think ahead 5+ turns.\n> \n> Also, there's a danger: Tail Reward Danger. If head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because after eating, tail grows and collides with head.\n> \n> In this case, tail is at (5,4). Head is at (4,6). Are they adjacent? (4,6) and (5,4) - x differs by 1, y by 2, so not adjacent; adjacent would be same x or same y, differ by 1, or diagonal? But movement is only up, down, left, right, so adjacency is horizontal or vertical, not diagonal. So (4,6) and (5,4) are not adjacent; they are two steps away. So no issue.\n> \n> Now, let's consider the two options.\n> \n> Option 1: Move D to (4,5) on turn 34.\n> \n> Then, head moves to (4,5), eats the food, snake grows. New positions: head at (4,5), then the body: since it grew, the tail doesn't move, so new body is (4,6) [which was head], (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4) [tail]. After eating, when snake moves to food, it grows, so the tail stays, and new head is at food position.\n> \n> Standard snake: when head moves to food, snake grows, so length increases by one, tail remains, new segment added at head.\n> \n> Positions: after moving to (4,5), head is (4,5), then previous head (4,6) becomes new second segment, then (3,6) becomes third, and so on, down to (5,4) which is still tail, but since it grew, the tail doesn't move, so positions: [ (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4) ] so now snake length 9.\n> \n> Food at (4,5) is eaten, so removed.\n> \n> Head direction now: since I moved down, new direction is D.\n> \n> Life span of (4,5) was 2, but eaten, so no issue.\n> \n> Now, for turn 35, I need to move from (4,5).\n> \n> Possible moves: since direction is D, I cannot move U (reverse).\n> \n> From (4,5), adjacent cells:\n> \n> - U: (4,6) - occupied by body (second segment), so collision if I move there.\n> \n> - D: (4,4) - but (4,4) is an internal obstacle, wall, so invalid.\n> \n> - L: (3,5) - occupied by body, let's see positions: (4,5) head, (4,6) body, (3,6) body, (3,5) is also body? Positions: head (4,5), then (4,6), then (3,6), then (3,5), so (3,5) is the fourth segment, so moving to (3,5) would be collision.\n> \n> - R: (5,5) - not occupied, not wall. Is it wall? Walls: internal (4,4) is wall, but (5,5) not listed. Borders x=7,y=7, etc. So (5,5) should be free.\n> \n> So only possible move: R to (5,5).\n> \n> Then on turn 35, move to (5,5).\n> \n> No food there, so snake moves, tail moves: head to (5,5), then body: (4,5) becomes new second, (4,6) becomes third, etc., and tail (5,4) moves? After moving without eating, the tail moves forward.\n> \n> Positions before move: [ (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4) ]\n> \n> After moving R to (5,5): new head (5,5), then body segments: (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3) and tail (5,4) is removed? When moving without eating, the head moves to new position, each segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, so tail is removed.\n> \n> So positions: head (5,5), then (4,5), then (4,6), then (3,6), then (3,5), then (3,4), then (3,3), then (4,3), then (5,3). Tail was (5,4), which is gone, and (5,3) is now the last segment.\n> \n> Length is 9, but since no eat, after move, length same, tail moves off (5,4).\n> \n> Now head at (5,5), direction R (since moved right).\n> \n> Then for turn 36, from (5,5), possible moves.\n> \n> Cannot move L (reverse of R).\n> \n> - U: (5,6) - not occupied, not wall? (5,6) is within bounds, no wall, should be free.\n> \n> - D: (5,4) - but (5,4) was tail, but now it's empty? After move, (5,4) is empty. Positions: head (5,5), body (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3). So (5,4) is free? Yes, not occupied.\n> \n> But (5,4) is not in the list, so free.\n> \n> - L: (4,5) - occupied by body (second segment), collision.\n> \n> - R: (6,5) - not occupied, not wall.\n> \n> Also, walls: (5,4) is not wall, internal walls are (5,2), etc.\n> \n> (5,4) is free, I think.\n> \n> But there might be food?

Snake positions: after turn 35 move, snake is at: head (5,5), body (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3). So (5,6) not occupied, and not wall, so free.\n> \n> - D (down): to (5,4).

It's turn 36, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so coordinates from (0,0) to (7,7), I assume. Internal obstacles are at (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4). That means I can't move into those cells.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (5,5), then (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3). So the snake has 9 segments. Head direction is right, so last move was to the right.\n> \n> Food:\n> \n> - (6,4) with life span 2, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (4,1) with life span 5, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (2,2) with life span 8, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> All food is positive, no negative food here. Life span decreases each turn, including current turn. So for (6,4), life span 2 means it will disappear after 2 more turns? Let me read: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So at turn t, if life_span is L, it will be gone after turn t + L - 1 or something? I need to be careful.\n> \n> It says: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So at the start of turn t, if life_span is L, after this turn it becomes L-1, and when it reaches 0, it disappears. For example, at turn 36, (6,4) has life_span 2, so after turn 36, it becomes 1, after turn 37 it becomes 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten on turn 36 or 37, but not after.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,1) life span 5: disappears after turn 40 (since 36+5-1=40? Let's think: after turn 36, life span 4; after 37, 3; after 38, 2; after 39, 1; after 40, 0 and gone. So last chance to eat is turn 40.\n> \n> Turn numbering: at turn t, we take action, then state updates.\n> \n> Current turn is t1=36. After action, turn becomes 37.\n> \n> Food (6,4) life span 2 at turn 36: after turn 36, life span 1; after turn 37, life span 0 and disappears. So can be eaten on turn 36 or 37.\n> \n> (4,1) life span 5: after turn 36, life span 4; ... after turn 40, life span 0, gone. Can be eaten from turn 36 to 40.\n> \n> (2,2) life span 8: after turn 36, life span 7; ... after turn 43, life span 0, gone. Can be eaten from turn 36 to 43.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (5,5), direction right. So from (5,5), possible moves: right to (6,5), up to (5,6), down to (5,4). Left to (4,5) but (4,5) is the second segment, so moving left would cause collision unless the tail moves away.\n> \n> Collision rules: head touches any body segment except the tail, because when head moves to tail, tail moves away, so it's safe unless it's a special case with food on tail.\n> \n> Also, walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, so cannot move outside (0,0) to (7,7). Internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4). (1,4) and (1,5) are both obstacles, so row y=1 has obstacles at x=1,2,4,5? Positions: (1,2), (1,4), (1,5) – so x=1, y=2; x=1,y=4; x=1,y=5. And (5,2), (4,4).\n> \n> Snake positions: head (5,5), then (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3). Tail is (5,3).\n> \n> Current direction right, so from (5,5), moving left to (4,5) is the neck, so that would cause collision because (4,5) is a body segment, not the tail, and it's adjacent. When head moves to a cell occupied by a body segment, it dies, except if it's the tail cell and the tail moves away.\n> \n> Rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, moving to a body segment other than the tail is fatal. Moving to the tail is safe because tail moves.\n> \n> In this case, from (5,5), adjacent cells:\n> \n> - Right: (6,5) – is this empty? Let's see the grid.\n> \n> First, walls: borders are walls, so (6,5) is within bounds, x=6<7, y=5 between 0 and 7.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4) – none at (6,5), so it should be free.\n> \n> But is it occupied by snake? Snake positions: head (5,5), body (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3). So (6,5) not in list, so empty.\n> \n> Up: (5,6) – y=6, x=5. Walls: y=7 is border, so y=6 is ok. No internal obstacles at (5,6). Snake: not occupied, so empty.\n> \n> Down: (5,4) – y=4, x=5. Walls ok. Internal obstacles: (4,4) is an obstacle, but that's (4,4), not (5,4). (5,4) not listed, so should be free. Snake: positions include (3,4), (4,3), etc., but (5,4) not there, so empty.\n> \n> Left: (4,5) – this is the second segment of the snake. Since it's not the tail, moving left to (4,5) would cause collision because head touches body.\n> \n> Tail is (5,3), so (4,5) is body, not tail.\n> \n> Therefore, possible moves from (5,5) are: Right (R) to (6,5), Up (U) to (5,6), Down (D) to (5,4). Left (L) to (4,5) is invalid due to collision.\n> \n> Also, no instant reverse: current direction is right, so I cannot move left immediately, but left is already invalid for collision, so not an issue.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score, prioritizing long-term survival.\n> \n> Food available:\n> \n> - (6,4): close to head, at (6,4), head at (5,5), so adjacent down-right? (5,5) to (6,4) is diagonal, not adjacent. Adjacent cells are (6,5), (5,6), (5,4), etc.\n> \n> From (5,5), (6,4) is not adjacent; it's one step right and one down, so not directly reachable in one move. To reach (6,4), I need to go to (6,5) or (5,4) first, then to (6,4).\n> \n> Similarly, (4,1) is at bottom, y=1, x=4. Head at (5,5), so far away.\n> \n> (2,2) at top-left, x=2,y=2.\n> \n> Life spans: (6,4) must be eaten soon, in turn 36 or 37.\n> \n> (4,1) has until turn 40.\n> \n> (2,2) has until turn 43.\n> \n> Snake length is 9, so growing by eating food.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan a sequence of actions for multiple turns.\n> \n> The answer should include an action sequence for several turns and a thinking conclusion.\n> \n> First, let's sketch the grid for visualization.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n> \n> Walls: borders x=0,x=7,y=0,y=7 are walls.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4)\n> \n> (1,4) and (1,5) are obstacles, so at x=1, y=4 and y=5 are blocked.

When snake moves without eating, tail moves away.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, if no food, the tail moves off its position, so length same.\n> \n> Here, moving to (5,4), which has no food, so after move, positions: head (5,4), then (5,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3) — (5,3) is no longer part, tail is (4,3).\n> \n> Original: positions [ (5,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3) ]\n> \n> After move down to (5,4): head moves to (5,4), so new head (5,4), then the rest: the first body segment is (5,5), then (4,5), etc., up to (4,3), and (5,3) is removed since no growth.

So new body segments: from (6,4) to (3,3), but (4,3) was tail, removed, so the new tail is the segment that was before tail, which is (3,3).\n> \n> List current snake: indices for clarity.\n> \n> Current snake positions: 0: head (6,4), 1: (6,5), 2: (5,5), 3: (4,5), 4: (4,6), 5: (3,6), 6: (3,5), 7: (3,4), 8: (3,3), 9: tail (4,3)\n> \n> After move to (6,3), no food eaten, so:\n> - New head: (6,3)\n> - New body: segment 0 moves to where? The body segments shift: new segment 1: old head (6,4), new segment 2: old segment 1 (6,5), new segment 3: old segment 2 (5,5), ..., up to new segment 9: old segment 8 (3,3). Old segment 9 (4,3) is removed.\n> \n> So new snake: head (6,3), then (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3)  // 10 segments? Head and 9 body segments.\n> \n> Positions: (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3) — that's 10 cells, but (3,3) is now the tail.\n> \n> Old tail (4,3) removed, so the snake is now from (6,3) to (3,3), with tail at (3,3).\n> \n> Similarly, if I move L to (5,4), new head (5,4), body: (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), etc., tail (4,3) removed, new tail (3,3).\n> \n> Now, (5,4) — is it free? Earlier I thought (5,4) is not occupied, but let's confirm obstacles. Internal obstacles include (4,4) but not (5,4), and not wall, not snake body? Current snake has (6,4), (5,5), etc., not (5,4), so yes, (5,4) should be free.\n> \n> But there's an obstacle at (4,4), which is adjacent.\n> \n> Now, I need to think about getting to the food.\n> \n> Food at (4,1), (2,2), (2,1).\n> \n> (4,1) has short life, only 3 turns including current, so it will disappear after turn 40.

(4,4) is internal obstacle, so I cannot go to (4,4).\n> \n> So I cannot go directly left to (4,4) because it's blocked.\n> \n> I need to go around.\n> \n> Possible ways: from (6,4), I can go down to (6,3), or left to (5,4).\n> \n> If I go down to (6,3), then from there, I can go left to (5,3) or down to (6,2), etc.\n> \n> If I go left to (5,4), then from (5,4), I can go down to (5,3) or left to (4,4) but (4,4) obstacle, so cannot go left, only down or up or right, but up is (5,5) which is body?

(1,2), (1,4), (1,5)\n> \n> Let's list all obstacles:\n> \n> - Border walls: all cells where x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7\n> \n> - Internal: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4) — (1,4) and (1,5) are both listed, but (1,4) is separate from (1,5)? In the input it says: [(5, 2), (4, 4), (1, 2), (1, 5), (1, 4)] so yes, (1,4) and (1,5) are both obstacles, and (1,2).\n> \n> Also (4,4) is an obstacle.\n> \n> Now snake head at (5,3), moving down. Down means increasing y? Let's confirm coordinates. Typically in grids, y increases upwards or downwards? In the movement, U is (x,y+1), so y+1 is up, I think? Let's see:\n> \n> Movement: U (x,y+1), D (x,y-1), L (x-1,y), R (x+1,y)\n> \n> So U: y increases, which is usually north or up.\n> \n> D: y decreases, down.\n> \n> L: x decreases, left.\n> \n> R: x increases, right.\n> \n> And walls: y=0 is bottom or top? Since D is (x,y-1), y-1 decreases y, so if y=0 is the bottom, then D towards y=0 is down. But in the wall, y=0 is a wall, so probably y=0 is the bottom wall.\n> \n> Similarly, y=7 is top wall? Since U is (x,y+1), towards higher y.\n> \n> In the snake positions, head at (5,3), and segments: (5,4), which has higher y, so since head is at (5,3) and next is (5,4), which is up, but head direction is D, down. Contradiction?\n> \n> Head position: (5,3)\n> \n> Next segment: (5,4)\n> \n> (5,4) has y=4, which is greater than y=3, so if y increases up, (5,4) is above (5,3). But head direction is D, down, meaning it was moving down to (5,3)? Let's see the sequence.\n> \n> Snake positions: [(5,3), (5,4), (6,4), ...]\n> \n> So from (5,4) to (5,3), that would be moving down, since y decreased from 4 to 3. Yes, so head was at (5,4) on previous turn, moved down to (5,3) on this turn. So current head at (5,3), and it just moved down.\n> \n> Direction is D, which is consistent.\n> \n> Now, possible moves from (5,3):\n> \n> - U: (5,4) — but (5,4) is occupied by the first body segment. But can we move there? Movement constraints: we can move into a cell that will be vacated by the tail, but here (5,4) is not the tail, it's the second segment.\n> \n> Rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, moving to a body segment causes collision, except for the tail cell, because the tail moves.\n> \n> Here, (5,4) is the first body segment, not the tail. Tail is at (3,4), last position.\n> \n> So from (5,3), possible moves:\n> \n> - U: to (5,4) — but (5,4) is occupied by body, so collision, death.\n> \n> - D: to (5,2) — but (5,2) is an internal obstacle? Obstacles include (5,2), which is a wall, so cannot move there.\n> \n> - L: to (4,3) — is this free? Let's see what's at (4,3).\n> \n> First, list all occupied cells by snake: positions are (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4)\n> \n> So cells occupied: (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (3,4)\n> \n> Also obstacles: walls at borders, and internal: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4)\n> \n> (1,4) and (1,5) are obstacles, but (1,4) is listed, so occupied.\n> \n> Now, from (5,3), possible moves:\n> \n> - U: (5,4) — occupied by body, not tail, so collision.\n> \n> - D: (5,2) — obstacle, wall.\n> \n> - L: (4,3) — what is here? Not in snake positions, not an obstacle? Obstacles are (5,2), (4,4), etc., (4,3) is not listed as obstacle. Walls are only borders and specific internals. (4,3) is not a border wall (x=4, y=3, x between 1-6, y between 1-6, so should be free, unless occupied.\n> \n> Snake positions don't have (4,3), obstacles don't have (4,3), so (4,3) should be free.\n> \n> - R: (6,3) — (6,3) is not in snake positions, not an obstacle. x=6, y=3, not border wall since x=6 is not wall? Walls at x=0 and x=7, so x=6 is not wall. y=3 not wall. Internal obstacles no, so free.\n> \n> But (6,4) is occupied by snake, but (6,3) is different cell.\n> \n> Also, cannot move opposite to current direction instantly. Current direction is D (down), so opposite is U (up). But U is invalid anyway due to body, so no issue.\n> \n> Possible moves: L to (4,3) or R to (6,3).\n> \n> D is invalid, U is invalid.\n> \n> Now, food: at (4,1) with life span 1, must be eaten this turn to get it. But can we reach it?\n> \n> (4,1) is at x=4,y=1. Head at (5,3). To go to (4,1), need to move left and down, but from (5,3), moving L to (4,3), then from there, can move D to (4,2), then D to (4,1). But (4,1) is y=1, which is not wall? y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=1 is playable, but (4,1) has food.\n> \n> But life span 1, so only if we eat it on this turn, turn 40.\n> \n> But from (5,3), we can only move to (4,3) or (6,3) this turn. To reach (4,1) in one move? No, it's two moves away: to (4,3) then to (4,2), then to (4,1), so three moves? From (5,3) to (4,3) is one move, then to (4,2) second, to (4,1) third. But turn 40: we move to either (4,3) or (6,3). Then turn 41: from there.\n> \n> But food at (4,1) has life span 1, meaning after turn 40, it disappears. So it can only be eaten on turn 40, but head is at (5,3), not adjacent to (4,1), so impossible to eat it this turn. Therefore, it will disappear after this turn, so no point trying to get it.\n> \n> Similarly, other food: (2,2) life span 4, (2,1) life span 7, (3,1) life span 10.\n> \n> Now, tail is at (3,4), and there might be food under tail? But food positions are given, and (3,4) is tail, but no food listed at (3,4), so probably not.\n> \n> Food is at (4,1), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), all different from snake positions.\n> \n> Now, back to possible moves from (5,3): L to (4,3) or R to (6,3).\n> \n> I need to think ahead multiple turns.\n> \n> First, let's consider moving left to (4,3).\n> \n> Turn 40: move L to (4,3)\n> \n> Then snake positions: head moves to (4,3), so new head (4,3), then body: previous head (5,3) becomes first body, so positions: [(4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5)] and tail (3,4) moves away? When head moves, the tail moves forward, so the last segment is removed, and new head added.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, tail is removed.\n> \n> So after moving to (4,3), new positions: head (4,3), then (5,3) (previous head), then (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5). Tail was (3,4), which is removed, so snake has 9 segments? No, when no food eaten, length same, tail removed.\n> \n> Current snake length 10, no food eaten, so after move, head to new position, tail removed, so 10 segments: new head, and body from index 0 to 8 of previous positions.\n> \n> Previous positions: index 0: (5,3) head, 1: (5,4), 2: (6,4), 3: (6,5), 4: (5,5), 5: (4,5), 6: (4,6), 7: (3,6), 8: (3,5), 9: (3,4) tail.\n> \n> After move to (4,3): new head (4,3), then body: previous positions from 0 to 8: (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5). And tail (3,4) gone, so positions: [(4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5)]? That's 10 positions: head (4,3), then (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5). (3,5) is the new tail.\n> \n> (3,5) was previously index 8, now it's tail.\n> \n> Similarly, if move R to (6,3), similar.\n> \n> Now, from (4,3), what can we do?\n> \n> Possible moves: from (4,3), current direction after move: we moved L, so direction now L? Direction is based on the move we made.\n> \n> After moving L to (4,3), head direction is L (left).\n> \n> Then possible moves: U, D, L, R, but no instant reverse, so cannot move R (right), since that would be opposite to current L.\n> \n> Also, check cells:\n> \n> - U: (4,4) — but (4,4) is an internal obstacle, wall, cannot move there.\n> \n> - D: (4,2) — is this free? (4,2) not in current snake positions, not obstacle? Obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), etc., not (4,2), so free.\n> \n> - L: (3,3) — free? Not occupied, not obstacle.\n> \n> - R: (5,3) — but (5,3) is occupied by body (second segment), and it's not tail, so collision if move there.\n> \n> Also, cannot move R because opposite direction, but even if allowed, occupied.\n> \n> So from (4,3), possible moves: D to (4,2) or L to (3,3).\n> \n> Similarly, if we had moved R to (6,3) on turn 40.\n> \n> Turn 40 move R to (6,3): new head (6,3), body: (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), etc., tail (3,4) removed, positions: [(6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5)]\n> \n> Direction now R (right).\n> \n> Possible moves from (6,3): U, D, L, R.\n> \n> No reverse: cannot move L (left), opposite to R.\n> \n> - U: (6,4) — occupied by body (third segment, (6,4)), not tail, collision.\n> \n> - D: (6,2) — free?

But food at (4,1), life span 1, but on turn 40 it was life span 1, now turn 41, it should be gone? Life span decreases every turn.\n> \n> At turn 40, food (4,1) has life span 1, meaning after turn 40, it disappears, so on turn 41, it's not there.\n> \n> Similarly, other food: at turn 40, (2,2) life span 4, so it will disappear after turn 43?

Let's clarify.\n> \n> Rule: \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So at turn t, if life span is N, it decreases each turn, so after N turns, it disappears. That means it exists for N turns: from turn t to turn t + N - 1, and disappears at turn t + N.\n> \n> For example, at turn 40, (4,1) life span 1: countdown decreases on turn 40, so after turn 40, it disappears. So it can only be eaten on turn 40.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,2) life span 4 at turn 40: it will disappear after 4 turns, so after turn 43? Countdown decreases every turn, including turn 40, so after 4 decreases, gone.\n> \n> After turn 40: countdown becomes 3, turn 41: 2, turn 42: 1, turn 43: 0, disappears after turn 43? Disappears after N turns, meaning after N full turns.\n> \n> Rule: \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> At turn t, with life span N, after k turns, life span is N - k, and when life span becomes 0, it disappears.\n> \n> So for (4,1) at turn 40, life span 1: on turn 40, it can be eaten. If not eaten, after turn 40, life span 0, disappears.\n> \n> For (2,2) at turn 40, life span 4: can be eaten on turns 40,41,42,43? On turn 40, life span 4, after turn 40, life span 3, so exists turn 40 to 43? Life span decreases to 3 after turn 40, so on turn 41, life span is 3, meaning it has 3 turns left including turn 41.\n> \n> Generally, with life span N at turn t, it exists until turn t + N - 1, and disappears at turn t + N.\n> \n> For (2,2): life span 4 at turn 40, so exists on turns 40,41,42,43, disappears after turn 43 (turn 44).\n> \n> Similarly, (2,1) life span 7: exists turns 40 to 46, disappears after 46.\n> \n> (3,1) life span 10: exists turns 40 to 49, disappears after 49.\n> \n> Back to turn 40 action.\n> \n> If we move L to (4,3) on turn 40.\n> \n> Then on turn 41, from (4,3), we can move D to (4,2) or L to (3,3).\n> \n> First, option move D to (4,2) on turn 41.\n> \n> Then head to (4,2), direction D.\n> \n> No food at (4,2), and (4,1) is gone, so no eat.\n> \n> New positions: head (4,2), body (4,3), (5,3), etc.\n> \n> Then from (4,2), possible moves: U, D, L, R.\n> \n> No reverse: cannot move U (up).\n> \n> - U: (4,3) occupied by body, collision.\n> \n> - D: (4,1) — now (4,1) is empty, but no food, and it's free.

(2,2) is not in the snake positions listed, so it should be free. But there's food there.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,1) is not in snake positions, free with food.\n> \n> (3,3): is it occupied? Snake has (4,3), but not (3,3), so free.\n> \n> But I need to consider that after moving, the snake body shifts.\n> \n> Also, the food at (4,2) is under the snake body? (4,2) is a body segment, specifically the first segment after head. Position (4,2) is occupied by the snake body.\n> \n> But food is at (4,2) with life span 10. But since it's under the body, it can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves there. Rule: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> Currently, (4,2) is occupied by the snake body, so to eat that food, the snake must move such that the body segment leaves (4,2), and then head moves to (4,2) later.\n> \n> But right now, head is at (3,2), moving left.\n> \n> I need to plan 5+ turns ahead to maximize score, prioritizing long-term survival.\n> \n> First, let's see possible actions for this turn, turn 43.\n> \n> Head at (3,2), direction L.\n> \n> Options: L to (2,2), U to (3,3), D to (3,1)\n> \n> Now, check each:\n> \n> - Move L to (2,2): (2,2) has food with value 1, life span 2. If I move here, I eat the food? But (2,2) is not currently occupied by body, so yes, head can move there and eat, since it's not under body now. It's a free cell with food.\n> \n> Is (2,2) a wall? Borders: x=0 and x=7, y=0 and y=7. (2,2) is within, not border. Internal obstacles: (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), (4,4), (5,2). (2,2) not listed, so safe.\n> \n> Snake body: positions are (3,2), (4,2), etc., (2,2) not occupied, so moving to (2,2) should be safe, and I eat the food, so length increases by 1.\n> \n> But after eating, the tail doesn't move, so snake grows.\n> \n> Current length: 10 segments.\n> \n> After eating, 11 segments, tail stays put for this move? Standard snake: when you eat, you grow, so after moving head to food, the tail doesn't move for that turn.\n> \n> Rule: \"Length of snake +1\" when eating positive food.\n> \n> So, if head moves to food cell, snake grows, so the new position is added, and tail doesn't move, so the snake gets longer.\n> \n> If not eating, head moves, tail moves, length same.\n> \n> Now, for (2,2): food there, so if I move to (2,2), I eat it, grow to 11 segments.\n> \n> But life span is 2, so if I don't eat it now, it might disappear soon.\n> \n> Move U to (3,3): (3,3) is empty? Let's see what's at (3,3). No food listed, and not snake body, so free cell. Move there, no eat, snake moves normally, tail moves to (4,2)? Let's simulate.\n> \n> Move D to (3,1): (3,1) has food with value 1, life span 7. So if move there, eat food, grow.\n> \n> Now, also, there's a danger: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If head adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> Tail is at (4,6). Head is at (3,2), which is not adjacent to (4,6). Adjacent means sharing an edge, so up/down/left/right.\n> \n> (3,2) to (4,6): delta x=1, delta y=4, not adjacent. So no issue now.\n> \n> First, for turn 43, I need to choose action.\n> \n> But I need to think ahead 5+ turns.\n> \n> Also, the food at (4,2) is under the body, so I need to plan to eat it later.\n> \n> Let me sketch the grid.\n> \n> Grid: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n> \n> Walls: borders and internal: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4)\n> \n> Internal obstacles are walls, I assume.\n> \n> Snake: head (3,2), body: (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), tail (4,6)\n> \n> Food: (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,2) but (4,2) is occupied by body.\n> \n> (4,2) is body segment, so food there is under body.\n> \n> Now, life span of (4,2) is 10, so plenty of time.\n> \n> But (2,2) has short life, only 2 turns left, including this turn.\n> \n> At turn 43, life_span=2, after this turn, it becomes 1, then after turn 44, it becomes 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten on turn 43 or 44.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,1) life_span=4, so can be eaten on turns 43,44,45,46.\n> \n> (3,1) life_span=7, turns 43-49.\n> \n> (4,2) under body, life_span=10.\n> \n> Now, to eat (4,2), I need the body to move away from (4,2) first.\n> \n> Currently, (4,2) is occupied by the first body segment. When the snake moves, if I don't eat, the head moves to new position, and each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, so the tail moves away.\n> \n> For example, if I move from (3,2) to some direction without eating, then:\n> \n> - New head position\n> \n> - Body segment at (4,2) moves to (3,2) (previous head position)\n> \n> - Body segment at (4,3) moves to (4,2)?

To free (4,2), I need the tail to pass through or something, but since the snake is long, it will take several moves for the tail to leave (4,2).\n> \n> Let's see the snake body: positions from head: (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (4,6)\n> \n> So the segment at (4,2) is the second segment. When the snake moves, if no eating, each segment moves forward.\n> \n> The position (4,2) will be occupied until the tail leaves it.\n> \n> The tail is at (4,6), and to reach (4,2) from tail, it's not direct, but the occupancy changes as the snake moves.\n> \n> For example, after one move without eating, the tail moves to (4,5) if the head moves away, but let's simulate.\n> \n> Suppose at turn 43, I move to a direction without eating.\n> \n> Say I move head to (3,3) up.\n> \n> Then new head: (3,3)\n> \n> Then body: index 1 moves to old head (3,2)\n> \n> Index 2 moves to old index 1 position (4,2)? No.\n> \n> Positions after move:\n> \n> - Head new: (3,3)\n> \n> - Segment 1 (was at (4,2)) moves to where head was, (3,2)\n> \n> - Segment 2 (was at (4,3)) moves to where segment 1 was, (4,2)\n> \n> - Segment 3 (was at (5,3)) moves to where segment 2 was, (4,3)\n> \n> - Segment 4 (was at (5,4)) moves to where segment 3 was, (5,3)\n> \n> - Segment 5 (was at (6,4)) moves to where segment 4 was, (5,4)\n> \n> - Segment 6 (was at (6,5)) moves to where segment 5 was, (6,4)\n> \n> - Segment 7 (was at (5,5)) moves to where segment 6 was, (6,5)\n> \n> - Segment 8 (was at (4,5)) moves to where segment 7 was, (5,5)\n> \n> - Segment 9 tail (was at (4,6)) moves to where segment 8 was, (4,5)\n> \n> So new positions: head (3,3), then (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5)\n> \n> Tail is now at (4,5).\n> \n> Position (4,2) is now occupied by segment 2, still occupied.\n> \n> If I move again, it might stay occupied for a while.\n> \n> The food at (4,2) can only be eaten when no snake segment is on it, which will happen when the tail finally leaves that cell.\n> \n> Currently, the cell (4,2) is part of the body, and it will be occupied until the snake moves enough that the tail is not there, but since it's near the head, it will be occupied for many moves unless I eat and grow, which might delay the tail moving.\n> \n> To free (4,2), I need the segment that is currently at (4,2) to move away, and no other segment to occupy it immediately, but in a snake, when moving, cells are occupied sequentially.\n> \n> The position (4,2) will be free when the last segment that was on it moves away and no new segment comes.\n> \n> In this case, since (4,2) is currently occupied by segment 1, and when the snake moves, segment 1 moves to the previous head position, and segment 2 moves to (4,2), so it remains occupied by segment 2. Then segment 2 moves to where segment 1 is, and segment 3 moves to (4,2), and so on. So (4,2) will be occupied as long as the snake is on that cell, until the tail passes through.\n> \n> The tail is at (4,6), and to move to (4,2), it would take several moves, but the path might not be direct.\n> \n> From the positions, the snake is coiled, so (4,2) might be occupied for a while.\n> \n> For example, the segment that is on (4,2) now will move, but the cell (4,2) will be reoccupied by the next segment until the tail.\n> \n> Specifically, after k moves without eating, the cell that was occupied by segment i will be occupied by segment i+k, until i+k > length, then it might be free, but here i=1 for (4,2), length 10.\n> \n> After 9 moves without eating, the tail would be where the head was, and (4,2) might be free if not reoccupied, but in this case, it's messy.\n> \n> To free a body-occupied cell, I need to move the snake such that the tail leaves that cell without another segment entering, but since the snake is contiguous, when the tail leaves a cell, it's free only if no new segment comes, but in normal movement, when tail leaves, the cell is empty.\n> \n> For example, in the initial move simulation, when tail moves from (4,6) to (4,5), the cell (4,6) is freed.\n> \n> Similarly, for (4,2), it will be freed when the segment that is currently there moves away and no other segment moves to it, but in the chain, when a segment moves from a position, the next segment moves to it, so it stays occupied until the last segment on that cell moves away.\n> \n> The position (4,2) will be occupied until the segment that is destined to be the last on it moves off.\n> \n> Since the snake is 10 long, and (4,2) is the second position, it will take at least 8 moves for the tail to reach where the head is now, but the head is moving, so it's complicated.\n> \n> Perhaps for simplicity, to free (4,2), I need to move the snake so that the tail comes to (4,2) and leaves, which might take many turns.\n> \n> But life span is 10, so there's time.\n> \n> Now for the short-life food, like (2,2), life span 2, so I should consider eating it soon.\n> \n> Let's plan for turn 43.\n> \n> Options:\n> \n> 1. Move L to (2,2): eat food there, grow to 11 segments. New head at (2,2). Then body: since ate, tail doesn't move, so new positions: head (2,2), then old head (3,2) becomes body, then (4,2), (4,3), etc., up to (4,6) still there. So snake: (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (4,6) — 11 segments.\n> \n> Direction: I moved L, so new head direction L.\n> \n> Then for next turn, I can move from (2,2): possible U, D, L (not R, since opposite to L).\n> \n> U to (2,3), D to (2,1), L to (1,2).\n> \n> (1,2) is an internal obstacle, wall, so cannot move there.\n> \n> (2,1) has food, (2,3) is free? Need to check.\n> \n> 2. Move U to (3,3): no food there, so no eat, snake moves: head to (3,3), then body: (3,2) from old head, (4,2) from old seg1, (4,3) from old seg2, etc., down to tail to (4,5), as I had earlier. Length 10.\n> \n> New head direction U.\n> \n> Then from (3,3), can move U, D, L, R? Current direction U, so can move U, L, R, not D (opposite).\n> \n> 3. Move D to (3,1): eat food there, grow to 11 segments. Head to (3,1), then body: old head (3,2) becomes body, then (4,2), (4,3), etc., up to (4,6). Snake: (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (4,6) — 11 segments.\n> \n> New head direction D.\n> \n> Then from (3,1), can move U, D, L, R? Current direction D, so can move D, L, R, not U (opposite).\n> \n> Now, I need to think ahead to eat other food and avoid risks.\n> \n> Also, the food at (2,2) has short life, so if I don't eat it now, I might miss it.\n> \n> At turn 43, if I move to (2,2), I eat it.\n> \n> If I move elsewhere, at turn 44, if I can move to (2,2), but after turn 43, if I didn't eat, the snake might have moved.\n> \n> For example, if I move U to (3,3) at turn 43, then at turn 44, head at (3,3), and (2,2) is still there with life span 1 (after turn 43 decrease), so I can move from (3,3) to (2,2)? (3,3) to (2,2) is left and down, not adjacent directly; adjacent cells are (3,4) up, (3,2) down, (2,3) left, (4,3) right. From (3,3), I can move to (2,3) L, (3,4) U, (4,3) R, (3,2) D.\n> \n> (2,2) is not directly adjacent to (3,3); (2,2) is diagonally, but in grid, only orthogonal moves, so I can't move directly from (3,3) to (2,2). I have to go through (2,3) or (3,2) first.\n> \n> So from (3,3), to reach (2,2), I need two moves, but at turn 44, (2,2) has life span 1, so after turn 44, it disappears. So I can only eat it on turn 44 if I am adjacent at turn 44.\n> \n> At turn 44, if head is at a cell adjacent to (2,2), I can move to it.\n> \n> Adjacent cells to (2,2) are: (2,3) up, (2,1) down, (1,2) left, (3,2) right.\n> \n> But (1,2) is a wall, so not accessible.\n> \n> So possible: (2,3), (2,1), (3,2)\n> \n> At turn 44, if head is at one of these, I can move to (2,2) to eat.\n> \n> But at turn 43, after move, if I didn't go to (2,2), where is head?\n> \n> If I moved U to (3,3) at t43, then at t44 head at (3,3), which is not adjacent to (2,2). From (3,3), I can move to (3,2) D or (2,3) L.\n> \n> If I move to (3,2) D, (3,2) is now a body cell? After t43 move U to (3,3), positions: head (3,3), body (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), etc.\n> \n> (3,2) is body segment, so at t44, if I move D to (3,2), but (3,2) is occupied by body, so collision? Rule: body collision if head touches any body segment.\n> \n> If I move head to a cell occupied by body, it's collision, death.\n> \n> So from (3,3), moving D to (3,2), but (3,2) has a body segment, so I die.\n> \n> Similarly, moving to (2,3) L: (2,3) is free? No food listed, and not snake, so ok.\n> \n> But (2,3) is not adjacent to (2,2); from (2,3), (2,2) is down.\n> \n> But at t44, if I am at (2,3), I can move to (2,2) if it's still there.\n> \n> But at t44, after t43 move, (2,2) has life span 1, so I can eat it at t44 if I move to it.\n> \n> But to be at a position to move to (2,2) at t44, I need to be at (2,3), (2,1), or (3,2) at start of t44.\n>

No.\n> \n> If life span is N at turn t, and countdown decreases every turn including current, then:\n> \n> - At turn t: life span N\n> \n> - After turn t, it becomes N-1\n> \n> - After turn t+1, N-2, and so on, until it reaches 0, and disappears.\n> \n> Typically, if life span is 3 at turn 44, it will be available on turn 44, 45, 46, and disappear after turn 46, so not available on turn 47. Let's confirm.\n> \n> \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So for (2,1) with life span 3 at turn 44:\n> \n> - Turn 44: life span 3\n> \n> - Turn 45: life span 2\n> \n> - Turn 46: life span 1\n> \n> - Turn 47: life span 0, disappears, so not present.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,1) life span 6 at turn 44, so it will last until turn 44 + 5 = 49? Let's see:\n> \n> After turn 44, life span 5? I think I need to think in terms of how many turns it has left.\n> \n> At the start of turn t, life span is given, and after each turn, it decreases by 1.\n> \n> So for food at (x,y,v,l) at turn t:\n> \n> - It can be eaten on turns where l > 0.\n> \n> - After being eaten, it's gone, but if not eaten, after l turns, it disappears.\n> \n> \"Disappears after N turns\" meaning N turns from now.\n> \n> But \"countdown decreases every turn including current\" – this might be ambiguous.\n> \n> Let's read carefully: \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> I think it means that at the beginning of turn t, the life span is N, and during turn t, if not eaten, at the end of turn t, life span becomes N-1. Then at turn t+1, it starts with N-1, and so on, until it reaches 0 and disappears.\n> \n> But for eating, it can be eaten during the turn when life span > 0.\n> \n> In the state, it's given at turn t with life span L, so it can be eaten on this turn if head moves there.\n> \n> Then after this turn, if not eaten, life span decreases.\n> \n> Similarly for next turns.\n> \n> For (2,1): life span 3 at turn 44, so available on turn 44, 45, 46; disappears after turn 46.\n> \n> Turn 47 it would be gone.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,1): life span 6, available from turn 44 to 49 (since 44 to 44+5=49? Let's count: turn 44: L=6, turn 45: L=5, ..., turn 49: L=1, turn 50: L=0 disappear. So available turns 44 to 49 inclusive.\n> \n> Turn 44: L=6, can be eaten.\n> \n> Turn 45: L=5, can be eaten.\n> \n> ...\n> \n> Turn 49: L=1, can be eaten.\n> \n> Turn 50: not present.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,2): life span 9, available turn 44 to 52.\n> \n> But (4,2) is currently occupied by the snake body? Snake positions include (4,2), which is the third segment.\n> \n> Food can spawn under body, but can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves there later.\n> \n> Now, for this food at (4,2): it's under the snake body, so to eat it, the snake must move away from (4,2) so that the cell is free, then later head can move onto it when it's available.\n> \n> But since it's under body now, and head is not there, it can't be eaten immediately.\n> \n> Similarly, other foods are at (2,1) and (3,1), which are not occupied by snake, I think.\n> \n> Let's list all cells.\n> \n> First, snake positions: head (2,2), then (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (4,6)\n> \n> So the snake has 11 segments? Count: (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (4,6) – that's 11 positions.\n> \n> Food at:\n> \n> - (2,1): not in snake positions, empty cell.\n> \n> - (3,1): not in snake positions, should be empty.\n> \n> - (4,2): but (4,2) is occupied by the snake body, specifically the third segment.\n> \n> So (4,2) has food under it, but since snake is there, it can't be eaten yet.\n> \n> For (4,2) food to be eaten, the snake must move so that (4,2) is vacated, then head can later move to it.\n> \n> But life span is 9, so it has time.\n> \n> Now, head is at (2,2), direction L, so last move was left to (2,2) from (3,2)? Positions: head (2,2), next (3,2), so from (3,2) to (2,2) was a left move, so head direction L means it was moving left.\n> \n> Now, possible moves: I can move U, D, L, R, but cannot instant reverse. Current direction L, so cannot move right (opposite), so possible moves: U, D, L.\n> \n> Reverse of L is R, so cannot move R on next turn.\n> \n> So from (2,2), I can go:\n> \n> - U: (2,3)\n> \n> - D: (2,1)\n> \n> - L: (1,2)\n> \n> But need to check walls and obstacles.\n> \n> Walls: border x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so grid is from x=1 to 6? x=0 and x=7 are walls, y=0 and y=7 walls, so playable area x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? But internal obstacles.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4)\n> \n> (1,2) is an obstacle, and (1,4), (1,5), (4,4), (5,2)\n> \n> Also borders, so cells outside x=1-6, y=1-6 are walls, but since x=0,7 and y=0,7 are walls, so coordinates from (1,1) to (6,6) are playable, except obstacles.\n> \n> x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x from 1 to 6 inclusive, similarly y from 1 to 6.\n> \n> Now, cells: (1,1) to (6,6), but with obstacles at (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4)\n> \n> (1,4) and (1,5) are obstacles, and (1,2) is obstacle, so column x=1 has obstacles at y=2,4,5, so only y=1,3,6 might be free? But need to see.\n> \n> Similarly, other points.\n> \n> Back to head at (2,2), possible moves:\n> \n> - U: to (2,3) – is this free? Snake body? (2,3) not in snake positions, and not obstacle? Obstacles are (5,2),(4,4),(1,2),(1,5),(1,4), so (2,3) is clear? But is it within bounds? x=2, y=3, between 1-6, yes.\n> \n> - D: to (2,1) – (2,1) has food, and it's within bounds, not obstacle, not snake body? Snake is at (2,2), etc., (2,1) not listed, so should be free except food.\n> \n> - L: to (1,2) – but (1,2) is an internal obstacle, so cannot move there.\n> \n> (1,2) is listed as internal obstacle, so wall, cannot move to (1,2).\n> \n> Also, cannot move R because instant reverse not allowed, direction L, so R is opposite.\n> \n> So possible moves from (2,2): U to (2,3), D to (2,1), or L but L to (1,2) is wall, so not possible. So only U or D.\n> \n> U: (2,3) or D: (2,1)\n> \n> Now, (2,1) has food with life span 3, so it can be eaten if I move there.\n> \n> But I need to think 5+ turns ahead, prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> Also, there's a danger about tail reward: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> First, where is the tail? Snake positions: last one is (4,6), so tail is at (4,6).\n> \n> Head at (2,2), tail at (4,6), not adjacent.\n> \n> Adjacent cells: (2,2) neighbors: (2,3), (2,1), (1,2), (3,2)\n> \n> (3,2) is the next body segment, not tail.\n> \n> Tail is (4,6), which is far.\n> \n> So no immediate danger from that.\n> \n> Now, food at (2,1): if I move D to (2,1), I eat it, get +1, length increases by 1, so new head at (2,1), and tail stays, but since I ate, tail doesn't move, so snake grows.\n> \n> When I eat, the head moves to food, and since I eat, I grow, so tail doesn't move that turn.\n> \n> Standard snake: when you eat, head moves to food, new segment added, so tail stays in place.\n> \n> Otherwise, head moves, tail moves one step.\n> \n> Here, similar.\n> \n> If I move to (2,1), I eat the food, so new positions: head at (2,1), then previous head (2,2) becomes new body, and all segments shift, but since I ate, I add a segment, so the tail doesn't move.\n> \n> Current snake: positions S = [ (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (4,6) ] 11 segments.\n> \n> If I move to (2,1) and eat food, new head at (2,1), then body: (2,2) (now part of body), (3,2), ..., up to (4,6), and since I ate, I add a new segment, so the tail stays at (4,6), but the segment before tail was (4,5), which is now the second last.\n> \n> After eating, the snake grows, so the new body includes the previous positions plus the new head, and tail remains.\n> \n> Positions: new head at (2,1), then the previous head (2,2) is now the first body segment, then (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), and tail (4,6) still there, and since I ate, I add a segment, so the tail doesn't move, and a new segment is added at the end? No.\n> \n> In snake, when you eat, the head moves to the food cell, and a new segment is added at the tail position, but the tail doesn't advance, so effectively, the snake grows by one cell.\n> \n> For example, before move: head at A, body B, C, ..., Y, tail Z.\n> \n> After moving to food F: head at F, then A, B, C, ..., Y, Z, and since ate, Z stays, so new tail is still Z, and length increased.\n> \n> The segment Z remains as tail.\n> \n> In terms of positions, after eating, the positions are [F, A, B, C, ..., Y, Z], so Z is still the tail.\n> \n> Then next move, when I move, tail moves to the previous position of the second last, but since I didn't eat, tail moves.\n> \n> But in this case, after eating at (2,1), new positions: head (2,1), then (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (4,6) — so (4,6) is still tail, and length 12 now.\n> \n> (4,6) is the tail, and it stays.\n> \n> If I don't eat, move to empty cell, head moves, tail moves to the next position.\n> \n> But here, if I move to (2,1), I eat.\n> \n> Now, (2,1) food has life span 3, but at turn 44, I eat it, so it's consumed.\n> \n> Life span is for how long it exists if not eaten.\n> \n> Since I eat it, it's gone.\n> \n> Similarly, other foods.\n> \n> Now, back to choices: I can go U to (2,3) or D to (2,1).\n> \n> If I go D to (2,1), I eat immediately, get +1, but I need to think ahead.\n> \n> If I go U to (2,3), no food there, so just move, head to (2,3), tail moves, so tail at (4,6) moves to where?

It's turn 45. The grid has walls: border cells where x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7, so the grid is 8x8 from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are at the borders, meaning I can't go to those coordinates. Also, internal obstacles at (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), and (1,4). So those are blocked cells.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (2,1), then body segments: (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (4,6). So the snake is 12 segments long. Head direction is Down (D), meaning it's moving downward.\n> \n> Food: two items:\n> \n> - At (3,1) with value 1 and life span 5. Since current turn is 45, it disappears after 5 turns, so by turn 50.\n> \n> - At (4,2) with value 1 and life span 8, so disappears after 8 turns, by turn 53.\n> \n> Both are positive food since value is +1.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan actions for the next few turns, thinking at least 5 turns ahead. I should prioritize long-term survival over immediate rewards.\n> \n> First, let's map out the grid. I'll sketch an 8x8 grid.\n> \n> Rows y from 0 to 7, columns x from 0 to 7.\n> \n> Walls: all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4).\n> \n> Snake positions:\n> \n> - Head: (2,1)\n> \n> - Body: (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (4,6)\n> \n> So tail is at (4,6).\n> \n> Food: (3,1) and (4,2)\n> \n> But (4,2) is currently occupied by the snake's body. Specifically, looking at positions: (4,2) is the fourth segment in the list: positions index 0 is head (2,1), index 1 is (2,2), index 2 is (3,2), index 3 is (4,2). So (4,2) is a body segment.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (3,1) is not occupied; it's adjacent to head.\n> \n> Head is at (2,1), and (3,1) is right next to it, to the right? Let's see coordinates.\n> \n> x increases right, y increases up? Or down? In grid coordinates, usually y=0 is bottom or top? The movement says U (x,y+1), D (x,y-1), so if U is y+1, that might mean y increases upward, like in math coordinates. But in many games, y increases downward. I need to clarify.\n> \n> Movement: U (x,y+1), D (x,y-1), L (x-1,y), R (x+1,y). So if U is (x,y+1), that suggests y+1 is up, so y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top? But walls are at y=0 and y=7, so y=0 is bottom wall, y=7 is top wall. Similarly, x=0 left, x=7 right.\n> \n> In the snake positions, head is at (2,1). With direction D, down, which is (x,y-1), so moving to lower y, meaning downward, so y=1 is above y=0, so y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top. Yes.\n> \n> So head at (2,1). Possible moves: since direction is D, I can go L, R, or D, but not U because no instant reverse. Current direction D, so cannot go U immediately. So possible moves: L (left, x-1), R (right, x+1), or D (down, y-1).\n> \n> Now, check adjacent cells:\n> \n> - Left (L): (x-1,y) = (1,1)\n> \n> - Right (R): (x+1,y) = (3,1)\n> \n> - Down (D): (x,y-1) = (2,0)\n> \n> Now, (2,0) is y=0, which is a border wall, so cannot go there. Wall collision.\n> \n> (1,1): is this a wall? Internal obstacles are (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), but (1,1) is not listed. Walls are borders and internals. Borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So (1,1) should be free, unless it's an internal obstacle, but internals are (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4). (1,2) is an obstacle, but (1,1) is not listed, so it should be empty.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,1) is not occupied by snake or walls? Snake positions: (2,1) is head, (2,2), (3,2), etc. (3,1) is not in snake positions. Walls: not border or internal, so free. And food is there.\n> \n> Food at (3,1), so (3,1) has food.\n> \n> (4,2) has food but it's under the snake body.\n> \n> Now, for (1,1): let's see if it's safe. Snake positions: head (2,1), body (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), etc. (1,1) not occupied. Walls: not. So free.\n> \n> But I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n> \n> First, immediate options:\n> \n> - Move L to (1,1): possible, and empty.\n> \n> - Move R to (3,1): possible, and has food. Eating it would give +1, length increases.\n> \n> - Move D to (2,0): impossible, wall.\n> \n> So only L or R are possible moves this turn.\n> \n> If I move R to (3,1), I eat the food there. Value +1, life span 5, but since I eat it now, life span doesn't matter. Eating it: head moves to (3,1), which is food, so snake grows: new head at (3,1), and body adds a segment, so tail doesn't move, length becomes 13.\n> \n> But the food at (3,1) is eaten, so removed.\n> \n> Then snake positions become: head (3,1), then previous head (2,1) becomes body, so new positions: [(3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (4,6)] and since we add a segment, the tail stays, so positions: 13 segments.\n> \n> Initially 12 segments: indices 0 to 11: (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (4,6)\n> \n> After moving to (3,1) and eating, head to (3,1), and since food, we don't remove tail, so new head (3,1), then the old positions: (2,1) becomes neck, then (2,2), etc., up to (4,6), and we add a new segment at the tail? No.\n> \n> Standard snake: when you eat, the head moves to food, and a new segment is added at the tail position, so the tail doesn't move, meaning the body grows.\n> \n> So positions: new head at food cell (3,1), then the previous head (2,1) is now part of body, and all body segments remain, but since we add a segment, the last segment (tail) stays in place, so the snake extends.\n> \n> So from 12 segments, after eating, 13 segments.\n> \n> Sequence: head was at (2,1), moves to (3,1), which is food, so head now at (3,1), and the segment that was at (2,1) is now the first body segment at (2,1), but since head moved, the body follows, but when eating, the tail doesn't move, so the body doesn't advance; we add a segment.\n> \n> Mechanic: in snake, when you move without eating, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, tail moves away from its position.\n> \n> When you eat, head moves to food, but tail doesn't move, so the cell that was tail remains, and a new segment is added there, so snake grows by one.\n> \n> In terms of positions: after move, if no eat, positions shift: new head, then old head, then the rest, and tail is removed from the list.\n> \n> If eat, new head at food, old head becomes body, and tail is not removed, so positions list has one more segment.\n> \n> In this case, moving to (3,1) which has food, so after turn 45: head moves to (3,1), eats food, so new positions: head (3,1), then previous head (2,1) now body, then (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (4,6) and since we ate, we add a new segment at the end, but the tail was (4,6), and since tail doesn't move, (4,6) stays as tail, so positions: [(3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (4,6)] but (4,6) is still there, and we add a new segment?

The rule: \"disappears after N turns (N = life_span) Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So for food at (4,2), life span 8 at turn 45, so at turn 46, life span 7, ..., turn 52, life span 1, after turn 52, it disappears, so it can be eaten from turn 45 to 52 inclusive? Countdown decreases every turn, including current.\n> \n> At turn t, life span L, it means it will disappear after L turns, so it is present for L turns including the current one if not eaten.\n> \n> Rule: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" so at turn 45, life span 5 for (3,1), so after 5 turns, it disappears. After turn 49, it is gone, so it can be eaten on turns 45,46,47,48,49.\n> \n> Similarly for (4,2), life span 8, can be eaten on turns 45 to 52.\n> \n> Now, (4,2) is currently occupied by the snake body, so it can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves onto it.\n> \n> Currently, at turn 45, position (4,2) is occupied by body, so head cannot move there now.\n> \n> As the snake moves, that body segment will move to a different position.\n> \n> Let's see the current position of the segment at (4,2): it is index 3 in the list.\n> \n> When the snake moves, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> For example, if we move this turn, the body at (4,2) will move to where the previous segment was, but it depends on the move.\n> \n> I should simulate a few moves.\n> \n> First, I need to choose an action for turn 45.\n> \n> Options: L or R.\n> \n> If I move R to (3,1), I eat the food, grow to 13, head at (3,1), direction R.\n> \n> Then for turn 46, from (3,1), direction R, so possible moves: U, D, R (since not reverse, cannot L).\n> \n> Cells: U (3,2), D (3,0), R (4,1)\n> \n> (3,2) is occupied by body?

It's turn 46. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and internal obstacles at (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4). So, these cells are blocked and I can't move there.\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (3,1), and the body segments follow: (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (4,6). That's 13 segments, so the snake is 13 units long.\n> \n> Head direction is R, which is right, so currently moving east.\n> \n> Food: two pieces. One at (4,2) with life span 7 and value 1 (positive). Another at (5,1) with life span 10 and value 1 (also positive).\n> \n> But (4,2) is currently occupied by the snake's body. Specifically, looking at snake positions: (4,2) is the fourth segment, index 3 if head is 0. Snake positions: index 0: (3,1) head, 1: (2,1), 2: (2,2), 3: (3,2), 4: (4,2), etc. So (4,2) is occupied by the body.\n> \n> According to the rules, food can spawn under the body but can only be eaten if the body moves away and then the head moves onto it. So for (4,2), it's under the body now, so to eat it, I need to move the snake so that the body segment leaves (4,2), and then later move the head there.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,1) is a food position, and it's not occupied by the snake currently. Let me check the positions: snake has (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), etc. (5,1) is not in the list, so it's free.\n> \n> (5,1) is at x=5,y=1. Walls: borders are x=0,7 and y=0,7, so (5,1) should be within bounds. Internal obstacles: (5,2) is an obstacle, but (5,1) is not listed, so it should be accessible.\n> \n> Now, life spans: for (4,2) food, life span 7, meaning it disappears after 7 turns, including current turn, so after turn 46+7=53 it will be gone. Similarly, (5,1) has life span 10, so disappears after turn 46+10=56.\n> \n> Current turn is 46, so for (4,2) food, it has 7 turns left, counting turn 46. So it can be eaten from turn 46 to 52 inclusive? Let's clarify the countdown.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So if life_span is S at turn T, it will disappear at the end of turn T + S - 1? I need to be careful.\n> \n> Typically, if countdown decreases every turn including current, and disappears after N turns, meaning after N steps.\n> \n> Say at turn T, life_span is L. After turn T, countdown becomes L-1, and so on, until countdown 0, then it disappears.\n> \n> So for (4,2): life_span 7 at turn 46. After turn 46, it will have 6 left; after 47, 5; ... after 52, 1 left; after turn 53, it would be 0 and disappear. So it can be eaten on turns 46 to 53? But on turn 53, if eaten, but after turn 53 it disappears, so eating must happen before it disappears.\n> \n> Eating happens when the head moves onto the cell on that turn.\n> \n> So for a food with life_span L at turn T, it can be eaten on any turn from T to T + L - 1, because after T + L - 1 turns, at the start of turn T + L, it might be gone, depending on implementation.\n> \n> The rule says: \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> I think it's safer to assume that at the beginning of turn T, if life_span is L, it will be present during turn T, and if not eaten, at the end of turn T, countdown decreases to L-1, and so on, until countdown 0, then it disappears before the next turn.\n> \n> So for (4,2) at turn 46, life_span 7, so it will be present on turns 46,47,48,49,50,51,52. After turn 52, if not eaten, it disappears before turn 53.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,1) life_span 10, present on turns 46 to 55, disappears before turn 56.\n> \n> Now, back to the snake. Head at (3,1), direction R. So from (3,1), possible moves: since direction is R, I can go U, D, R, but not L because that would be instant reverse, opposite to R. L is left, which is opposite to right, so cannot move L next turn.\n> \n> Current head direction is R, so possible actions: U (up), D (down), R (right).

Walls: border cells x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7. So (3,0) has y=0, so it's a wall, cannot move there.

Not in snake positions, so should be free, but is it a wall? Walls: internal obstacles are (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4). (4,1) not listed, and not border since x=4,y=1, between 0 and 7, so should be free.\n> \n> But let's confirm: borders are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so (4,1) is within bounds.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (4,4) is one, but (4,1) not listed, so yes, (4,1) is empty.\n> \n> So from (3,1), possible moves:\n> \n> - U to (3,2): but (3,2) is occupied by snake body (index 3), so collision, invalid.\n> \n> - D to (3,0): y=0, wall, invalid.\n> \n> - R to (4,1): empty, no wall, not snake body (snake has (4,2) etc., but not (4,1)), so valid.\n> \n> - L to (2,1): but L is opposite to current direction R, so invalid.\n> \n> So only possible move is R to (4,1).\n> \n> Is that right? Current head at (3,1), moving R to (4,1).\n> \n> But let's list all adjacent cells:\n> \n> - Up: (3,2)\n> \n> - Down: (3,0)\n> \n> - Left: (2,1)\n> \n> - Right: (4,1)\n> \n> (3,2) is snake body, occupied.\n> \n> (3,0) is wall.\n> \n> (2,1) is also snake body, occupied by index 1: (2,1).\n> \n> (4,1) is free.\n> \n> And since current direction is R, moving L to (2,1) is opposite, so invalid anyway.\n> \n> So indeed, only possible move is R to (4,1).\n> \n> But if I move to (4,1), what happens? The snake moves, head to (4,1), then the body follows: the tail will move from (4,6) to whatever, but since we move one step, the segment that was at (2,1) will move to head old position or something? Standard snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> So after moving R to (4,1), new head position (4,1), then the body: the first body segment (was at (2,1)) moves to (3,1), which was head position. Then (2,2) moves to (2,1)? Let's list new positions.\n> \n> Current positions: [(3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (4,6)]\n> \n> After move R: head to (4,1), then the segments: the segment that was at index 1 (2,1) moves to old head (3,1), index 2 (2,2) moves to old index 1 (2,1), index 3 (3,2) moves to old index 2 (2,2), index 4 (4,2) moves to old index 3 (3,2), and so on, up to index 12 (4,6) moves to old index 11 (4,5)? Let's sequence it.\n> \n> New positions: head at (4,1)\n> \n> Then body[0] (which was at (2,1)) moves to (3,1)\n> \n> body[1] (was (2,2)) moves to (2,1)\n> \n> body[2] (was (3,2)) moves to (2,2)\n> \n> body[3] (was (4,2)) moves to (3,2)\n> \n> body[4] (was (4,3)) moves to (4,2)\n> \n> body[5] (was (5,3)) moves to (4,3)\n> \n> body[6] (was (5,4)) moves to (5,3)\n> \n> body[7] (was (6,4)) moves to (5,4)\n> \n> body[8] (was (6,5)) moves to (6,4)\n> \n> body[9] (was (5,5)) moves to (6,5)\n> \n> body[10] (was (4,5)) moves to (5,5)\n> \n> body[11] (was (4,6)) moves to (4,5)\n> \n> And tail was (4,6), now moves to (4,5)\n> \n> So new snake: [(4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5)]\n> \n> Now, food: (4,2) is still there, but now in new positions, (4,2) is occupied by body segment, index 5: (4,2)\n> \n> Similarly, (5,1) food is still at (5,1), not eaten.\n> \n> Now, head at (4,1), direction was R, but after moving, new head direction depends on the action, but for next move, current direction is the direction we just moved, which is R.\n> \n> I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n> \n> But for turn 46, I must choose an action, and only R is possible, so I have to go R to (4,1).\n> \n> Then for turn 47, I can plan from there.\n> \n> The action sequence should start from turn 46.\n> \n> So for turn 46: action must be R.\n> \n> Then turn 47: from (4,1), with direction R (since I moved right).\n> \n> Now, at (4,1), possible moves: U, D, R, L? Current direction R, so cannot move L (left) because opposite.\n> \n> U to (4,2), D to (4,0), R to (5,1), L to (3,1)\n> \n> (4,0): y=0, wall, invalid.\n> \n> (3,1): now, in new positions, (3,1) is body segment, index 1, so occupied, cannot move there.\n> \n> (4,2): is occupied by body, index 5: (4,2), so collision if I move there.\n> \n> (5,1): is food, and not occupied, no wall, so can move there.\n> \n> Also, is (5,1) safe? It might be, but let's see.\n> \n> Possible actions from (4,1) with direction R:\n> \n> - U: to (4,2) - occupied by body, collision\n> \n> - D: to (4,0) - wall\n> \n> - R: to (5,1) - empty, food present\n> \n> - L: to (3,1) - occupied by body, and also opposite direction, so invalid anyway.\n> \n> So only possible move is R to (5,1).\n> \n> But (5,1) has food with value +1, so if I move there, I eat it, snake grows.\n> \n> If I eat at (5,1), then head moves to (5,1), and since food is eaten, the tail doesn't move, so snake grows by one segment.\n> \n> New head at (5,1), then body segments: the first body segment moves to old head (4,1), and so on, up to the tail stays, and a new segment is added at the tail position? Standard: when food eaten, head moves to food cell, body segments move as usual, but since tail doesn't move, a new segment is added at the tail position after movement.\n> \n> After moving to (5,1), head at (5,1), then body: segment that was at (3,1) moves to (4,1), segment that was at (2,1) moves to (3,1), segment that was at (2,2) moves to (2,1), and so on, down to segment that was at (4,5) moves to previous position, and the tail was at (4,5)? Current positions before move: head (4,1), body: (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5)\n> \n> After moving head to (5,1) and eating food, new head at (5,1), then:\n> \n> - body[0] (was (3,1)) moves to (4,1)  // old head position\n> \n> - body[1] (was (2,1)) moves to (3,1)\n> \n> - body[2] (was (2,2)) moves to (2,1)\n> \n> - body[3] (was (3,2)) moves to (2,2)\n> \n> - body[4] (was (4,2)) moves to (3,2)\n> \n> - body[5] (was (4,3)) moves to (4,2)\n> \n> - body[6] (was (5,3)) moves to (4,3)\n> \n> - body[7] (was (5,4)) moves to (5,3)\n> \n> - body[8] (was (6,4)) moves to (5,4)\n> \n> - body[9] (was (6,5)) moves to (6,4)\n> \n> - body[10] (was (5,5)) moves to (6,5)\n> \n> - body[11] (was (4,5)) moves to (5,5)\n> \n> And since food eaten, a new segment is added at the old tail position, which was (4,5), but after movement, the last body segment moved to (5,5), so new segment at (4,5)? I think I'm confusing.\n> \n> Standard: when food is eaten, the tail does not move, so the new segment is added at the tail position before movement.\n> \n> Before movement, tail is at (4,5).\n> \n> After head moves to new position, all body segments move forward, so the segment that was second to last moves to the last position, but since tail doesn't move, we add a new segment at the old tail position.\n> \n> So in this case:\n> \n> - Head moves to (5,1)\n> \n> - Then each body segment moves to the position of the previous one in the list.\n> \n> Specifically:\n> \n> - The segment that was at position 0 (body[0] at (3,1)) moves to where head was, (4,1)\n> \n> - body[1] at (2,1) moves to where body[0] was, (3,1)?

This is the only viable move.\n\n3. **Food at (5,1)**:\n   - Value: +1 (positive food).\n   - Life span: 9 turns (will disappear at turn 56).\n   - Eating this food will increase the snake's length by 1 (from 13 to 14) and give a reward of +1.\n\n4. **Food at (4,2)**:\n   - Value: +1 (positive food).\n   - Life span: 6 turns (will disappear at turn 53).\n   - Currently occupied by the snake's body (segment at (4,2)), so it cannot be eaten now. To eat it, the snake must move away from (4,2) and then return to it after the body has vacated the cell. However, given the current constraints, this is not feasible before the food disappears.\n\n5. **Immediate Action**:\n   - The only safe move is **Right (R)** to (5,1) to eat the positive food there. All other moves lead to immediate death.\n\n### Action Sequence\n- **Turn 47**: Move right (R) to (5,1) to eat the positive food.\n- **Turn 48**: From (5,1), the only safe move is right (R) to (6,1) (other directions are blocked by walls or body).\n- **Turn 49**: From (6,1), the only safe move is up (U) to (6,2) (other directions are blocked by walls or body).\n- **Turn 50**: From (6,2), the only safe move is up (U) to (6,3) (other directions are blocked by walls or body).\n- **Turn 51**: From (6,3), the only safe move is up (U) to (6,4) (other directions are blocked by walls or body).\n- **Turn 52**: From (6,4), the only safe move is up (U) to (6,5) (other directions are blocked by walls or body).\n\n### Conclusion\nThe only viable immediate action is to move right to (5,1) to eat the positive food and avoid collision. Subsequent moves are forced to navigate the snake out of the corner and into open space for survival. The food at (4,2) cannot be safely reached before it expires.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\boxed{R}",
        "state": "**Current Turn**: \\( t_0 = 47 \\)\n**Cells occupied by walls**:\n\t - Border Cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7.\n\t - Internal Obstacles: [(5, 2), (4, 4), (1, 2), (1, 5), (1, 4)]\n**Snake Positions**:[(4, 1), (3, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 3), (5, 4), (6, 4), (6, 5), (5, 5), (4, 5)]\n**Snake Head Direction**: R\n**Food Positions, Life Span and Value**:\n\t- (4, 2, 6, 1)\n\t- (5, 1, 9, 1)\n> **Guidance from a Previous Thinking Model:** Turn \\( t_1 = 47 \\)\n> <think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 47. The grid has walls: border cells at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, meaning it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7). Internal obstacles at (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4). So I must avoid those cells.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (4,1), then body segments: (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5). That's 13 segments, so the snake is 13 cells long. Head direction is R, meaning it's moving right, so from (4,1) to (5,1) would be right, but I need to check possible moves.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (4,2) with value 1, life span 6. But (4,2) is occupied by the snake's body! Specifically, looking at snake positions, (4,2) is the sixth segment: positions are [(4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), ...]. So (4,2) is a body cell.\n> \n> - (5,1) with value 1, life span 9. This one is not occupied by the snake currently. Head is at (4,1), so moving right to (5,1) would eat this food, but I need to check if it's safe.\n> \n> Now, about the food under the body: (4,2) has food, but since it's under the snake, I can only eat it if the body moves away and the head moves onto it. But currently, head is at (4,1), and (4,2) is a body cell. To eat it, I need to have the snake move such that the body leaves (4,2), and then head moves to (4,2) later.\n> \n> But let's see the life spans: (4,2) food has life span 6, meaning it disappears after 6 turns, including this turn, so it will be gone by turn 52 or something? Current turn 47, life span 6: it decreases each turn, so after 6 turns from now, it will be gone. Since it decreases including current turn, after turn 47, life span becomes 5, then 4, etc., so it exists until the end of turn 47 + 5 = 52? Let's clarify.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So at turn 47, life_span is given as 6, meaning after 6 turns, it disappears. After turn 47, it has 5 turns left? No.\n> \n> Typically, if life_span is N at turn t, it will disappear after N turns, meaning it is present from turn t to turn t + N - 1, and gone at turn t + N.\n> \n> For example, at turn 47, life_span=6, so it exists on turns 47,48,49,50,51, and disappears at turn 52. Similarly for the other food.\n> \n> (4,2) food: life span 6, so exists until turn 52 inclusive? Disappears after N turns, so if N=6, it disappears after 6 turns from now, so at turn 53 it is gone? I think I need to be careful.\n> \n> The rule: \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So at turn t, life_span = L, then at turn t, countdown is L; after turn t, countdown becomes L-1; when countdown reaches 0, it disappears.\n> \n> After N turns, it has been decreased N times, so at turn t + N, countdown is L - N, but since it started at L, after N decreases, it becomes 0 at turn t + N - 1? Let's think.\n> \n> At turn t, life_span given as L, meaning it has L turns left including this one. After this turn (turn t), it has L-1 turns left. After turn t+1, L-2, and so on, until after turn t + L - 1, it has 0 turns left, so it disappears at the beginning of turn t + L.\n> \n> For food at (4,2): at turn 47, life_span=6, so it will disappear at the start of turn 47 + 6 = 53. So it can be eaten on turns 47 to 52 inclusive.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,1) food: life_span=9, so disappears at turn 47 + 9 = 56.\n> \n> Now, the snake head is at (4,1), direction R (right). So possible moves from here: I can move U (up, to (4,2)? But (4,2) is occupied by the snake's body, and there's food there, but I can't move to it directly because it's a body cell, except for the tail.\n> \n> The rule: I can move into the cell occupied by the tail segment because the tail moves. But (4,2) is not the tail; tail is at (4,5) from the positions: last is (4,5), so tail is (4,5).\n> \n> Snake positions: head (4,1), then (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5). So tail is (4,5).\n> \n> (4,2) is the sixth segment, not tail. So moving to (4,2) would cause a collision with the body, which is deadly.\n> \n> Therefore, from (4,1), I cannot move up to (4,2) because it's a body cell and not the tail.\n> \n> Similarly, moving right to (5,1): is (5,1) occupied? Snake positions don't have (5,1), but let's see if it's a wall or something.\n> \n> (5,1) is not listed in walls or obstacles. Walls are border: x=0,7 or y=0,7, and internal: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4).\n> \n> (5,1) is at x=5,y=1, not on border since y=1 not 0 or 7, x=5 not 0 or 7, and not in internal obstacles, so it should be free.\n> \n> But there is food at (5,1), so moving right to (5,1) would eat the food there.\n> \n> Now, moving down: to (4,0)? But y=0 is border wall, so (4,0) is wall, cannot move there.\n> \n> Moving left: to (3,1)? (3,1) is occupied by the snake body, second segment. Not tail, so collision.\n> \n> Therefore, from current position, possible moves:\n> \n> - Up: (4,2) - but occupied by body, collision\n> \n> - Down: (4,0) - wall, collision\n> \n> - Left: (3,1) - body, collision\n> \n> - Right: (5,1) - free, and has food\n> \n> So only possible move is right to (5,1), eating the positive food there.\n> \n> But is that safe? Let's think ahead.\n> \n> After moving right to (5,1), the snake head moves to (5,1), and since it ate food, the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move. New positions: head at (5,1), then the body: the previous head (4,1) becomes new body, so positions: [(5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5)] and since it grew, tail stays at (4,5), but now length is 14.\n> \n> Original length 13, ate positive food, so length +1 to 14.\n> \n> Now, head at (5,1), direction was R, now after move, direction is R.\n> \n> Now, for next turn, possible moves from (5,1):\n> \n> - U: to (5,2) - but (5,2) is an internal obstacle! Walls include (5,2), so cannot move there.\n> \n> - D: to (5,0) - y=0, border wall, cannot.\n> \n> - L: to (4,1) - now (4,1) is the second segment, body, not tail, so collision.\n> \n> - R: to (6,1) - is this free? (6,1) not in snake positions, not wall? Walls: x=7 border, but x=6 not border, y=1 not border. Internal obstacles not at (6,1), so should be free.\n> \n> But let's check snake positions: after move, positions include (4,1), (3,1), etc., but (6,1) not listed, so free.\n> \n> So from (5,1), only possible move is right to (6,1).\n> \n> Then head at (6,1), direction R.\n> \n> Then from (6,1):\n> \n> - U: to (6,2) - free? Not wall, not in snake? After previous, positions: head (6,1), body: (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5) — (6,2) not there, and not wall, so possible.\n> \n> - D: to (6,0) - wall, cannot.\n> \n> - L: to (5,1) - body, collision, since (5,1) is now second segment.\n> \n> - R: to (7,1) - x=7 border wall, cannot.\n> \n> So possible: U to (6,2) or R but R is wall, only U possible? U and R, but R is wall, so only U to (6,2).\n> \n> (7,1) is wall, so only U.\n> \n> Now, but I need to think about the food at (4,2). It has life span until turn 52, so I have time, but I need to plan how to get to it.\n> \n> Currently, after moving right to (5,1), I'm forced to go right again to (6,1), then up to (6,2), etc.\n> \n> But let's list the sequence.\n> \n> Also, there is a danger with tail: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> But in this case, tail is at (4,5), not adjacent to head.\n> \n> Head at (4,1), tail at (4,5), not adjacent.\n> \n> After moving to (5,1), tail still (4,5), not adjacent.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> First, current turn 47, I must choose action for turn 47.\n> \n> As above, only possible move is R to (5,1).\n> \n> Then turn 48: from (5,1), only possible move is R to (6,1).\n> \n> Then turn 49: from (6,1), only possible move is U to (6,2).\n> \n> Now from (6,2): what can I do?\n> \n> Positions: after turn 49, head at (6,2), body: (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5) — tail at (4,5).\n> \n> Now from (6,2), possible moves:\n> \n> - U: to (6,3) — free?

It's turn 48, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid (since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think? Let me confirm the coordinates.\n> \n> Walls: Border cells x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7. That means x from 0 to 7, but since walls occupy those, the snake can only be on x=1 to x=6 and y=1 to y=6, I believe. Also, internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4). So those cells are blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions: Head is at (5,1), and direction is R (right). The body segments are listed: [(5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5)]. That's 14 segments. Let me count: 1.(5,1), 2.(4,1), 3.(3,1), 4.(2,1), 5.(2,2), 6.(3,2), 7.(4,2), 8.(4,3), 9.(5,3), 10.(5,4), 11.(6,4), 12.(6,5), 13.(5,5), 14.(4,5). Yes, 14 segments.\n> \n> Food: Only one food mentioned: (4,2) with value 1 and life span 5. But life span is 5 at turn 48? Let me read: \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value: - (4, 2, 5, 1)\". I think this means position (4,2), life span 5, value 1. But life span 5 means it disappears after 5 turns, including the current turn? So at turn 48, life span is 5, so it will disappear after turn 52? Let's see: life span decreases every turn, including current. So on turn 48, life span=5, turn 49 it becomes 4, turn 50:3, turn 51:2, turn 52:1, and on turn 53 it disappears? No: if it decreases every turn including current, then on turn t, if life span is N, it will be gone after N turns, meaning it can be eaten until turn t + N - 1 or something?\n> \n> Standard: if life span is N at turn t, it decreases by 1 each turn, so on turn t, N; turn t+1, N-1; ... turn t+(N-1), 1; and on turn t+N, it disappears. So it can be eaten from turn t to turn t+(N-1).\n> \n> Here, at turn 48, food at (4,2) has life span 5, so it can be eaten from turn 48 to 52 inclusive. After turn 52, it's gone.\n> \n> But the food is at (4,2). Now, looking at snake positions, (4,2) is occupied by the snake! Specifically, it's the 7th segment: position 7 is (4,2).\n> \n> The rule says: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> So currently, the food is under the snake at (4,2), which is part of the body. To eat it, the snake needs to move so that the body segment at (4,2) moves away, and then the head moves to (4,2).\n> \n> But the head is at (5,1), direction R. Possible moves: since direction is R, I can move R, U, or D? No instant reverse, so since current direction is R, I cannot move L (left). So possible actions: U (up), D (down), or R (right).\n> \n> Now, let's see the grid.

Let's see what's at (6,1).\n> \n> Snake positions: (6,1) is not listed, so it should be empty. But walls: x=7 is wall, but (6,1) is within bounds. Internal obstacles: no (6,1), so (6,1) should be free.\n> \n> U to (5,2): (5,2) is an internal obstacle! (5,2) is in the internal obstacles list: [(5,2), ...] so (5,2) is a wall, cannot move there.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4)\n> \n> So (5,2) is blocked, so moving U to (5,2) is invalid, wall collision.\n> \n> Therefore, only possible move is R to (6,1).\n> \n> Is that right?

Current direction is R, moving L is opposite, so not allowed.\n> \n> And moving to (4,1) would be body collision? Not necessarily, because the tail might move, but since it's the immediate next segment, if head moves to (4,1), which is the neck, it would collide immediately.\n> \n> The rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> In this case, (4,1) is the second segment, not the tail.

Old tail was pos 13 (4,5), but since no food eaten, tail is removed, so we have one less segment.\n> \n> After move without eating, the snake has the same number of segments, but the last position is discarded.\n> \n> So new positions: head at (6,1), then body: (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5)\n> \n> Tail is at (5,5).\n> \n> Old pos 13 (4,5) is removed, so no (4,5) anymore.\n> \n> Now, the food at (4,2) is still there, but now occupied by the snake? In the new positions, (4,2) is position 7: from above, position 7 is (4,2) (from old pos 6, which was (4,2)).\n> \n> In the new list: after move, positions are:\n> \n> 0: (6,1)\n> \n> 1: (5,1)\n> \n> 2: (4,1)\n> \n> 3: (3,1)\n> \n> 4: (2,1)\n> \n> 5: (2,2)\n> \n> 6: (3,2)\n> \n> 7: (4,2)  // food is here, but occupied by body\n> \n> 8: (4,3)\n> \n> 9: (5,3)\n> \n> 10: (5,4)\n> \n> 11: (6,4)\n> \n> 12: (6,5)\n> \n> 13: (5,5)  // tail\n> \n> So (4,2) is still occupied by the body segment at index 7.\n> \n> To eat the food at (4,2), the body needs to move away, and then head moves to it.\n> \n> But currently, after turn 48 move, we are at turn 49, and food life span decreases to 4.\n> \n> But at turn 49, (4,2) is still occupied.\n> \n> I need to plan to free (4,2) so head can eat it later.\n> \n> But life span is only 5, so it can be eaten until turn 52.\n> \n> Now, back to turn 48: I must move to (6,1), as only option.\n> \n> So for turn 48, action must be R.\n> \n> Then, at turn 49, head at (6,1), direction is now R (since I moved right).\n> \n> Now, possible moves from (6,1):\n> \n> - R to (7,1) but x=7 is wall, so invalid.\n> \n> - U to (6,2)\n> \n> - D to (6,0) y=0 wall, invalid.\n> \n> - L to (5,1) — but (5,1) is the neck, position 1, so body collision. Also, moving left would be reverse? Current direction is R, moving L is opposite, so not allowed.\n> \n> Therefore, only possible move is U to (6,2).\n> \n> Is (6,2) safe? Let's see: snake positions after turn 48 move: as above, (6,2) not occupied, and not a wall. Walls: (6,2) is not in internal obstacles, internal are (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4). So (6,2) should be free.\n> \n> Also, food: no food at (6,2), I think only one food at (4,2).\n> \n> So move U to (6,2).\n> \n> Then turn 49: move U to (6,2).\n> \n> New head at (6,2), body shifts: tail (5,5) removed? Let's not simulate fully each time, but I need to think ahead.\n> \n> After turn 49 move to (6,2), snake positions: head (6,2), then (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5) — tail is (6,5) now? After turn 48, tail was (5,5), but when head moves to (6,2), the segment that was at (5,5) is removed, so positions: head (6,2), then body: (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), and since no eat, tail removed, so last is (6,4)? Let's index:\n> \n> After turn 48: positions 0 to 13: (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5) — 14 positions, but after move without eat, it should be 13 positions.\n> \n> I think I miscounted.\n> \n> Initial snake: 14 segments.\n> \n> After one move without eating, length decreases? No, in snake, when no food eaten, the snake moves forward, so the tail cell is vacated, but the number of segments remains the same? No.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when the snake moves to a new cell, if no food, the head occupies the new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, and the tail segment is left, so the snake has the same number of segments, but the last position is no longer part of the snake.\n> \n> For example, from positions S = [H, B1, B2, ..., T]\n> \n> After move to new head position H_new, new positions: [H_new, H, B1, B2, ..., up to the second last, but since no grow, T is removed, so new snake is [H_new, H, B1, B2, ..., B_{n-2}] where B_{n-2} was the segment before T.\n> \n> In terms of indices, if there are n segments, after move without eat, new head, and segments 0 to n-2 of old become segments 1 to n-1 of new, and old segment n-1 (tail) is removed.\n> \n> So new snake has n-1 segments? No, the number of segments should stay the same unless food eaten.\n> \n> Clarify: when no food, the snake moves: head to new position, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so the tail position is vacated, but the snake has the same number of segments; it's just that the segments are shifted.\n> \n> For example, start with segments: A-B-C-D, head at A.\n> \n> Move to new position E, then new segments: E (head), then A (which was head, now neck), then B, then C. D is no longer part of snake.\n> \n> So the snake has 4 segments before, after move no eat, still 4 segments, but positions are E, A, B, C. D is free.\n> \n> In this case, from turn 48 to 49.\n> \n> Turn 48 after move to (6,1): positions: (6,1) head, then (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5) — that's 14 positions, but (5,5) is the tail.\n> \n> When I move to turn 49, from (6,1) to (6,2), new head at (6,2), then the body: old head (6,1) becomes new position 1, old position 1 (5,1) becomes new position 2, and so on, up to old position 12 (6,5) becomes new position 13? Let's list old positions after turn 48:\n> \n> Index 0: (6,1) head\n> \n> Index 1: (5,1)\n> \n> Index 2: (4,1)\n> \n> Index 3: (3,1)\n> \n> Index 4: (2,1)\n> \n> Index 5: (2,2)\n> \n> Index 6: (3,2)\n> \n> Index 7: (4,2)\n> \n> Index 8: (4,3)\n> \n> Index 9: (5,3)\n> \n> Index 10: (5,4)\n> \n> Index 11: (6,4)\n> \n> Index 12: (6,5)\n> \n> Index 13: (5,5) tail\n> \n> After moving to (6,2), new head at (6,2)\n> \n> Then new position 1: old position 0 (6,1)\n> \n> New position 2: old position 1 (5,1)\n> \n> New position 3: old position 2 (4,1)\n> \n> New position 4: old position 3 (3,1)\n> \n> New position 5: old position 4 (2,1)\n> \n> New position 6: old position 5 (2,2)\n> \n> New position 7: old position 6 (3,2)\n> \n> New position 8: old position 7 (4,2)\n> \n> New position 9: old position 8 (4,3)\n> \n> New position 10: old position 9 (5,3)\n> \n> New position 11: old position 10 (5,4)\n> \n> New position 12: old position 11 (6,4)\n> \n> New position 13: old position 12 (6,5)  // this is new tail\n> \n> Old position 13 (5,5) is removed, so not part of snake anymore.\n> \n> So new positions at turn 49: head (6,2), then (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5) — tail at (6,5).\n> \n> (4,2) is still occupied by position 8: (4,2).\n> \n> Food is at (4,2), but occupied.\n> \n> Life span of food: at turn 48, life span 5, so turn 49: life span 4, turn 50:3, etc., until turn 52: life span 1, then turn 53 gone.\n> \n> So we have until turn 52 to eat it.\n> \n> Now, at turn 49, head at (6,2), direction U (since moved up).\n> \n> Possible moves:\n> \n> - U to (6,3)\n> \n> - D to (6,1) but (6,1) is the neck, body collision, and reverse?

(4,2) is not the tail; the tail is at (5,4), which is vacated when we move.\n> \n> But (4,2) is in the middle, so it stays occupied as long as the snake doesn't shorten or something.\n> \n> The only way to vacate a cell is if it was the tail and we move without eating, then it's vacated.\n> \n> Otherwise, body cells are continuously occupied by some segment.\n> \n> For a food under the body to be eatable, the snake must move such that the segment on that cell moves away, and no other segment moves to it immediately, but since the body shifts, when a segment moves from a cell, it might be filled by the next or not.\n> \n> In this case, for (4,2), to be free, it must be that no segment is assigned to it after the move.\n> \n> That happens only if it was the tail and we move, or if the

position, and the previous segment doesn't move to it, but in the shift, it usually does.\n> \n> Let's think differently.\n> \n> The cell (4,2) will be vacated when the segment that is on it moves to another cell, and no other segment moves to it.\n> \n> That happens when the snake changes direction or at curves.\n> \n> In this snake, there is a bend at some point.\n> \n> From the initial

up, (6,4) right, (6,5) up, (5,5) left, (4,5) left.\n> \n> So there is a section where it goes from (4,2) to (4,3) up, then to (5,3) right.\n> \n> To free (4,2), since it's part of the body, we need the snake to move in a way that the segment at (4,2) advances, and the cell is not reoccupied.\n> \n> For example, if the snake moves forward, the segment at (4,2) will move to (4,3) if the head moves, but (4,3) is occupied, so it will move to the next position.\n> \n> In the current state at turn 51 start, positions:\n> \n> 0: (6,4) head\n> 1: (6,3)\n> 2: (6,2)\n> 3: (6,1)\n> 4: (5,1)\n> 5:

It's turn 49, and I'm playing Snake on a grid that seems to be 7x7, since the borders are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. That means the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think, because x=0 and x=7 are walls, similarly for y. Let me confirm: walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the grid is from (0,0) to (7,7), but (0,0) to (7,7) are walls, so the snake can only be on cells where 1 ≤ x ≤ 6 and 1 ≤ y ≤ 6? No, the borders are walls, so cells like (0,1) or (1,0) are walls, but the snake positions are given, so let's list the snake positions: [(6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5)]\n> \n> Head is at (6,1), and direction is R, which is right, so moving towards increasing x.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (4,2) with value 1 and life span 4\n> \n> - (6,1) with value 1 and life span 10\n> \n> But (6,1) is where the snake head is currently? Snake positions start with head at (6,1), and food is at (6,1). But according to the rules, food can spawn under the snake's body, but it can only be eaten if the body moves away and the head moves onto it. Here, (6,1) is the head, so the head is on the food? But the food is under the head? Let's read the rules carefully.\n> \n> \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if:\n> 1. The body moves away, and\n> 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> In this case, the head is on (6,1), and food is at (6,1), but since the head is already on it, can it be eaten? The rule says the head must move onto it after the body moves away. But here, the body is not on it; the head is on it. I think there might be a confusion.\n> \n> The food is at (6,1), and the snake head is at (6,1), so at turn 49, the head is on the food cell. But to eat it, since it's under the head, it might not be eaten immediately because the body needs to move away first? But the head is the one on it. Let me think.\n> \n> Perhaps at the start of the turn, if the head is on a food cell, it might be eaten, but the rule specifies that for food under the body, it requires moving away and then head moving on. For the head itself, it might be different.\n> \n> The rule says: \"the head moves onto the food cell\" – but if it's already on it, does that count? I think I need to interpret this.\n> \n> Probably, at the beginning of the turn, if the head is on a food cell, it can be eaten, but let's see the tail reward danger part.\n> \n> Also, there's a food at (4,2), which is also a snake body segment? Let's see snake positions: positions are [(6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5)]\n> \n> So (4,2) is the 8th position, which is a body segment, and food is at (4,2) with value 1 and life span 4.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,1) is head, and food is at (6,1) with value 1 and life span 10.\n> \n> Now, for the food at (6,1): since the head is on it at turn 49, can it be eaten this turn? But the rule says that for food under the snake, it can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves on. Here, the head is on it, but it hasn't moved onto it; it's already there. So perhaps it won't be eaten unless the snake moves away and comes back.\n> \n> I think I need to clarify the timing.\n> \n> Typically in Snake, when the head moves to a cell with food, it eats it at that moment. But here, if food is under the body, it's not eaten until the body leaves and head enters.\n> \n> But for the head cell, if food is there at the start, it might not be considered \"moved onto\" until the snake moves.\n> \n> Perhaps the state is given at the beginning of turn 49, before any action. So at t=49, snake head is at (6,1), and food is at (6,1), so if I don't move, or if I move, what happens?\n> \n> The action is for the current turn, so I choose a direction to move.\n> \n> If I move to a cell with food, I eat it.\n> \n> But here, the head is already on a food cell? That might be a special case.\n> \n> Let's read the rule again: \"the head moves onto the food cell\" – it implies that during the movement, when the head enters the cell, it eats it. If it's already there, it might not trigger eating.\n> \n> To avoid confusion, I should assume that at the start of the turn, if the head is on a food cell, it can be eaten only if the snake moves such that the head leaves or something, but that doesn't make sense.\n> \n> Perhaps the food is on the cell, and when the head enters it, it's eaten. If the head is already on it at the start, it might have been eaten in a previous turn, or it's not eaten yet.\n> \n> I think there's ambiguity. Let me look for clues.\n> \n> The food at (6,1) has life span 10, meaning it will disappear after 10 turns from now, I assume, but at turn 49, it's present.\n> \n> Since the head is on it, and it's turn 49, if I do nothing, it might not be eaten, but I have to move.\n> \n> Let's think practically. I need to choose an action for turn 49.\n> \n> Current head position: (6,1), direction R.\n> \n> Available moves: since I'm facing right, I can go U, D, R, but not L because that would be reverse, and no instant reverse is allowed. Current direction is R, so I can't go L immediately.\n> \n> So possible moves: U (up, to (6,2)? y increases up? Let's confirm coordinates.\n> \n> Typically in grids, y=0 might be top or bottom, but here it's not specified. From the walls, y=0 and y=7 are borders, and snake positions: (6,1) is head, (5,1) is next, so moving left to (5,1), so x decreases left, y up or down?\n> \n> Positions: from (6,1) to (5,1), so decreasing x is left, so moving left.\n> \n> Then from (5,1) to (4,1), left.\n> \n> Then to (3,1), left.\n> \n> To (2,1), left.\n> \n> Then to (2,2), which is down? (2,1) to (2,2), so if y=1 to y=2, and since y=0 is bottom or top? Walls: y=0 and y=7 are borders, so let's assume y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top, so increasing y is up. Common in coordinate systems.\n> \n> In the movement, U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), so U increases y, so y+1 is up, y-1 is down.\n> \n> In positions, from (2,1) to (2,2), which is from lower y to higher y, so up.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,2) to (3,2), right? (3,2) to (4,2), right, etc.\n> \n> So y=1 is row 1, y=2 is row above, so y increases upwards.\n> \n> Head at (6,1), direction R, so last move was to the right, from (5,1) to (6,1)? Positions: snake is [(6,1), (5,1), ...] so head (6,1), then (5,1), so the snake was at (5,1) previous, moved right to (6,1), so direction is R.\n> \n> Now for turn 49, I can move U, D, or R.\n> \n> U: to (6,2)\n> \n> D: to (6,0), but y=0 is wall, so cannot move there, collision.\n> \n> D is (x,y-1) = (6,1-1) = (6,0), which is wall, so invalid.\n> \n> R: to (7,1), but x=7 is wall, so also invalid.\n> \n> x=7 is border wall, so (7,1) is wall, cannot move there.\n> \n> L: to (5,1), but (5,1) is the second segment of the snake, and I cannot move there because it's body collision, except for the tail.\n> \n> Let's see: the tail is at (5,5), I think. Positions: last is (5,5), so tail is (5,5).\n> \n> If I move left to (5,1), that's the neck, which is body, so collision.\n> \n> But the rule says: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> Here, (5,1) is not the tail; it's the second segment. Tail is at (5,5).\n> \n> So moving to (5,1) would be collision with body.\n> \n> Similarly, U to (6,2): is that free? Let's see what cells are occupied.\n> \n> Snake positions: (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5)\n> \n> So (6,2) is not in the list, so it might be free, but there might be walls or food.\n> \n> Walls: borders x=0,7 y=0,7, and internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4)\n> \n> (5,2) is a wall, so (6,2) is not wall, but let's list all walls.\n> \n> Border walls: all cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4)\n> \n> So for (6,2): x=6, y=2, not border, not in internal obstacles, so it's free.\n> \n> But is it occupied by snake? Snake has (6,1), (6,4), (6,5), not (6,2), so (6,2) is empty.\n> \n> Similarly, D to (6,0) is wall, invalid.\n> \n> R to (7,1) wall, invalid.\n> \n> L to (5,1) is snake body, collision.\n> \n> So only possible move is U to (6,2).\n> \n> Is that right? U is to (6,2), which is free.\n> \n> But (5,2) is a wall, but (6,2) is different cell.\n> \n> (6,2) is not wall, not snake, so yes, only U is possible.\n> \n> But let's confirm: current direction R, so can go U, D, R, but D and R invalid, so only U possible? But U is perpendicular, so allowed.\n> \n> No instant reverse only forbids opposite direction, which is L, but L is also invalid for other reasons.\n> \n> So for turn 49, I must move U to (6,2).\n> \n> But there is food at (6,1), and I'm moving away from it, so I don't eat it now.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (4,2) is under the snake body at position (4,2), which is the 8th segment.\n> \n> Now, life span: food at (4,2) has life span 4, meaning it disappears after 4 turns, including current, so after turn 52 it disappears? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 49, life span 4, so it will be there for 4 more turns: turns 49,50,51,52, gone at turn 53.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (6,1) life span 10, so until turn 58 or something.\n> \n> But since I'm moving to (6,2), I don't eat anything this turn.\n> \n> Now, I need to think ahead 5+ turns.\n> \n> First, after moving to (6,2), the new head position is (6,2), and the tail moves, so the last segment (5,5) is removed, and new head at (6,2), so the snake body: the tail was (5,5), so it moves forward, meaning the segment before tail, which is (6,5) or what? Snake positions: after moving, the head moves to new position, and each segment follows.\n> \n> Current positions: head (6,1), then body: (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5) tail.\n> \n> After moving U to (6,2), new head is (6,2), then the body segments shift: the first body segment was (5,1), but now it's connected to new head, so the new position list: head (6,2), then the previous head becomes body, so (6,1) becomes first body, then (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), and the tail (5,5) is removed because we didn't eat, so length same.\n> \n> The tail is removed, so the new snake is: [(6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5)]?

It's turn 50, and the grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So coordinates range from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are at the borders, so playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6) I think? Walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so cells like (0,y) and (7,y) for all y, and (x,0), (x,7) for all x are walls. But internal obstacles are given separately.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: [(5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4)]\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (6,2), then (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5).

It's turn 51. The grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so coordinates from (0,0) to (7,7). Internal obstacles are at (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4).\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (6,3), then (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4). That's 14 segments. Head direction is Up (U), meaning last move was upwards.\n> \n> Food: two items. One at (4,2) with life span 2 and value 1 (positive). Another at (6,1) with life span 8 and value 1 (positive). Both are positive food.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks. Prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> First, let's map out the grid with obstacles and snake.\n> \n> Grid size: 8x8, walls on borders, so playable area is x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? No, x=0 and x=7 are walls, y=0 and y=7 are walls, so cells from (1,1) to (6,6) are playable, except internal obstacles.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4). So (1,2), (1,4), (1,5) are obstacles, and (4,4), (5,2).\n> \n> Snake positions:\n> \n> - Head: (6,3)\n> \n> - Body: (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4)\n> \n> (4,2) is listed as a food position, but it's also part of the snake body? Let's see: snake positions include (4,2) as the 10th segment? Counting: index 0: (6,3), 1: (6,2), 2: (6,1), 3: (5,1), 4: (4,1), 5: (3,1), 6: (2,1), 7: (2,2), 8: (3,2), 9: (4,2), 10: (4,3), 11: (5,3), 12: (5,4), 13: (6,4). Yes, (4,2) is occupied by the snake's body.\n> \n> But there's food at (4,2) with life span 2. According to the rules, food can spawn under the snake's body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and the head moves onto it. So currently, (4,2) has food under the body, but since the body is there, it can't be eaten yet.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (6,1) with life span 8. (6,1) is also part of the snake body, the third segment. So food is under the body at (6,1) as well.\n> \n> Food positions: (4,2) and (6,1), both have value 1 and life spans 2 and 8 respectively.\n> \n> Life span: for (4,2) it's 2, meaning it disappears after 2 turns, including current turn. So on turn 51, life span 2, so it will disappear after turn 52? Let's clarify life span.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So for food at (4,2), life span 2 on turn 51. That means:\n> \n> - Turn 51: life span 2, present\n> \n> - Turn 52: life span 1, present\n> \n> - Turn 53: life span 0, disappears? Or after N turns, so after turn 52, it might be gone.\n> \n> \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn including current.\"\n> \n> I think it means: at the start, life span is N, and each turn it decreases by 1. When life span reaches 0, it disappears at the end of that turn or before the next turn? But for eating, it needs to be present when the head moves to it.\n> \n> Typically, the food is present on turns where life span > 0. So for life span L on turn T, it is present on turns T, T+1, ..., T+L-1? Let's see.\n> \n> \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" so on turn T, countdown is C, it decreases to C-1 on turn T+1, and when it reaches 0, it disappears.\n> \n> So for food at (4,2) on turn 51: life span 2, so it is present on turn 51 and turn 52. After turn 52, it disappears, so not present on turn 53.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (6,1): life span 8, present for 8 turns from turn 51 to turn 58.\n> \n> Now, head is at (6,3), direction U. Possible moves: U, D, L, R. But cannot move opposite to current direction instantly. Current direction is U, so cannot move D (down) next, because that would be instant reverse.\n> \n> Allowed moves: U, L, R. Not D.\n> \n> Now, let's see the grid around head.\n> \n> Head at (6,3). Neighbors:\n> \n> - Up: (6,4) - but (6,4) is the tail of the snake? Snake positions: (6,4) is the last segment, index 13.\n> \n> (6,4) is occupied by the snake's tail.\n> \n> But according to movement rules, moving into the tail is possible because the tail will move forward, so it might be safe if we move onto the tail cell only if the tail moves away.\n> \n> Rule: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> But there's a special case: \"Tail Reward Danger: If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n> \n> In this case, for moving to (6,4), which is the tail, and it has no food? The food is at (4,2) and (6,1), not at (6,4). (6,4) is just snake body.\n> \n> Let's check if (6,4) has food. Food positions are (4,2) and (6,1), so (6,4) has no food. Therefore, moving to (6,4) should be safe, because the tail will move away when we move forward.\n> \n> Similarly, other directions.\n> \n> Possible moves from (6,3):\n> \n> - U (up): to (6,4) - currently occupied by tail (6,4)\n> \n> - D (down): to (6,2) - but (6,2) is the second segment of the snake, index 1, which is body, not tail. Moving to (6,2) would cause body collision because it's not the tail; it's a body segment that won't move away immediately.\n> \n> Snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, and if it eats food, a new segment is added at the tail, else tail moves forward, so the cell that was tail is vacated.\n> \n> But for body segments, when the snake moves, all segments shift, so the cell that was occupied by the body might be freed if it's not the new tail.\n> \n> Specifically, when head moves to a new cell:\n> \n> - If no food eaten, tail is removed, so the tail cell is vacated.\n> \n> - If food eaten, tail stays, and a new segment is added, so no cell is vacated except the head moved.\n> \n> For collision: head cannot touch any body segment except the tail cell under certain conditions.\n> \n> Rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, moving to a cell occupied by the tail is safe, because when you move, the tail moves away, so no collision.\n> \n> But moving to a cell occupied by a non-tail body segment is deadly, because that segment is still there and doesn't move away when head moves; it only moves after the head, so collision happens.\n> \n> In this case:\n> \n> From (6,3), moving:\n> \n> - U to (6,4): (6,4) is the tail, so moving here is safe, and since no food there, snake length remains, tail moves away.\n> \n> - D to (6,2): (6,2) is index 1, which is a body segment, not tail. So moving to (6,2) would cause collision with body, death.\n> \n> - L to (5,3): (5,3) is index 11, body segment, not tail. Collision.\n> \n> - R to (7,3): but x=7 is wall, so collision with wall, death.\n> \n> x=7 is wall, so R to (7,3) is invalid, wall collision.\n> \n> Similarly, y=0, y=7, etc., but here (6,3) to (7,3) is x=7, wall.\n> \n> Now, (5,3) is occupied by snake body, index 11.\n> \n> And (6,2) occupied.\n> \n> So only possible move without immediate death is U to (6,4), the tail.\n> \n> But let's confirm the snake positions: head (6,3), then (6,2), (6,1), etc., tail is (6,4)? Positions: [(6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4)]\n> \n> So the tail is (6,4). Yes.\n> \n> After moving U to (6,4), since no food there, the snake moves: head to (6,4), then the tail (6,4) was occupied, but since head moves to it, and no food, the tail segment is removed, and the new tail becomes what was the second last segment, which is (5,4)? Let's see the new positions.\n> \n> Current positions: index 0: (6,3) head, 1: (6,2), 2: (6,1), 3: (5,1), ..., 12: (5,4), 13: (6,4) tail.\n> \n> After moving head U to (6,4): new head at (6,4). Since no food eaten, the tail is removed, so the last segment (6,4) is gone, and the segments shift: new positions: head (6,4), then body: (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4). (5,4) is now the new tail.\n> \n> (5,4) was index 12, now it becomes the tail.\n> \n> And (6,4) was tail, but head moved there, so it's occupied, but since no food, tail is removed.\n> \n> In terms of the cell: before move, (6,4) occupied by tail. Head moves to (6,4), so now head is at (6,4), and since no food, tail is removed, so the cell that was tail is now head, and the previous segment becomes new tail.\n> \n> No collision because tail was there but moves away.\n> \n> Now, back to current turn, only possible safe move is U to (6,4).\n> \n> But are there other options?\n> \n> L to (5,3): (5,3) is occupied by body, index 11, which is not tail, so moving there would be collision.\n> \n> Similarly, D to (6,2): occupied by body, index 1, collision.\n> \n> R to (7,3): wall, collision.\n> \n> So only U is possible without dying immediately.\n> \n> But moving U to (6,4) is safe.\n> \n> Now, after that, we need to think ahead.\n> \n> But first, let's consider the food.\n> \n> Food at (4,2) with life span 2, so it will disappear after turn 52.

It's the 11th segment in the list: positions are [(6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), ...] so (4,2) is occupied. But food is at (4,2) with value 1, life span 1. But since it's under the body, I can only eat it if the body moves away and head moves there. But life span is 1, so it disappears after this turn, meaning I must eat it this turn or never.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (6,1): (6,1) is also occupied by snake body? Positions: (6,1) is the 4th segment. Food at (6,1) with life span 7.\n> \n> And food at (5,4): (5,4) is the tail position, but in the list, (5,4) is the last position, tail. Food at (5,4) with life span 10.\n> \n> But for food under the body, I can only eat it when the body moves away and head moves in.\n> \n> Specifically for (4,2): it's under a body segment, life span 1, so if I want to eat it, I need to have the head move to (4,2) this turn, but currently (4,2) is occupied, so I can't move there directly. The rule says: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> So, for (4,2), since life span is 1, if I don't eat it this turn, it disappears. But to eat it, I need that in this turn, when I move, the body segment that is at (4,2) moves away, and simultaneously, the head moves to (4,2). But that might not be possible because the head is at (6,4), which is not adjacent to (4,2). (6,4) to (4,2) is not adjacent; adjacent means up, down, left, right, so (6,4) can go to (6,5), (6,3), (5,4), or (7,4) but x=7 is wall, so (6,5), (6,3), (5,4).\n> \n> (5,4) is the tail, and there's food there, but let's see.\n> \n> First, for (4,2): it's currently occupied by a body segment. When I move, the snake moves one step. Since head is at (6,4) and direction is U, but I can choose a new direction, but with no instant reverse.\n> \n> Current head direction is U, so I cannot move down immediately, because that would be reverse to current direction.\n> \n> Possible moves from head position (6,4):\n> \n> - Up: (6,5)\n> \n> - Down: (6,3) but since current direction is U, moving down is reverse, so not allowed? No instant reverse: cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\n> \n> Current direction is U, so I cannot move D on this turn.\n> \n> So possible moves: U, L, R.\n> \n> U: (6,5)\n> \n> L: (5,4)\n> \n> R: (7,4) but x=7 is wall, so not possible.\n> \n> So only U or L.\n> \n> U: (6,5) — is this within bounds? y=5, grid y from 0 to 7, so y=5 is ok, and no wall mentioned except borders, so should be free unless occupied.\n> \n> But (6,5) is not in snake positions, and not a wall, so should be free.\n> \n> L: (5,4) — (5,4) is the tail position, but it's occupied by tail now. When I move, the tail will move, so if I move to (5,4), since tail is there, but after move, the head moves to new position, and tail moves forward, so the cell (5,4) might be vacated or not, depending on where tail moves.\n> \n> I need to think carefully about movement.\n> \n> When snake moves:\n> \n> - Head moves to a new cell.\n> \n> - Each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> - Tail moves away from its current position, so that cell becomes empty, unless a new segment is added when eating food.\n> \n> But when eating food, length increases, so tail doesn't move, I think.\n> \n> Standard snake mechanics:\n> \n> - If no food eaten, head moves to new cell, each body segment shifts to the next position, tail is removed, so the tail cell becomes empty.\n> \n> - If food eaten, head moves to food cell, new segment is added at the tail, so tail stays, and length increases.\n> \n> But here, for cells under body, food can be eaten only when body moves away.\n> \n> In this case, for (4,2), it's occupied by a body segment. After movement, if that segment moves, and if head moves there, it can be eaten.\n> \n> But for (4,2), it's not adjacent to head, so I can't move head there directly.\n> \n> (4,2) is two cells away from head (6,4). So impossible to move head to (4,2) in one turn.\n> \n> Therefore, for food at (4,2) with life span 1, it cannot be eaten because the head cannot reach it this turn, and since life span is 1, it disappears after this turn. So I should forget about that food; it's impossible to get.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (6,1): (6,1) is occupied by snake body, position index 4. Life span 7, so it has 7 turns left.\n> \n> Food at (5,4): (5,4) is the tail position, and there's food there with life span 10.\n> \n> (5,4) is adjacent to head (6,4)? (6,4) and (5,4) are adjacent horizontally; left from (6,4) is (5,4).\n> \n> And (5,4) has food, but it's currently occupied by the tail.\n> \n> Now, if I move to (5,4), what happens?\n> \n> Current head at (6,4), if I move left to (5,4), which is the tail.\n> \n> Since I'm moving to a cell with food, but it's occupied by tail.\n> \n> Rule: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n> \n> In this case, head is at (6,4), tail at (5,4), so they are adjacent. Tail cell (5,4) has food. If I move head to (5,4) to eat the food, then after eating, the snake grows, so a new tail is added. But since the head moves to where the tail was, and then a new segment is added at the tail, but the tail was at (5,4), so the new tail would be at (5,4), and head is now at (5,4), so they collide immediately, killing the snake.\n> \n> Yes, that's the Tail Reward Danger.\n> \n> So, I cannot eat the food at (5,4) by moving left, because that would cause collision.\n> \n> Moreover, since head and tail are adjacent, and food on tail, eating it is fatal.\n> \n> Therefore, I should not move to (5,4).\n> \n> Now, back to possible moves from (6,4):\n> \n> - Up: to (6,5)\n> \n> - Left: to (5,4) but dangerous as above\n> \n> - Right: to (7,4) is wall, impossible\n> \n> - Down: to (6,3) but current direction is U, so moving down is reverse, not allowed.\n> \n> So only possible safe move is Up to (6,5)? But is (6,5) safe?\n> \n> (6,5) is not occupied, not a wall, so should be safe to move there.\n> \n> But let's confirm the grid.\n> \n> Grid: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls at borders, so (6,5) is within bounds, y=5 <7, x=6<7, so ok.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4) — none at (6,5), so free.\n> \n> Snake positions: (6,5) not listed, so free.\n> \n> So moving Up to (6,5) is possible.\n> \n> But if I move Up, what about the food?\n> \n> First, food at (4,2) is impossible to get, life span 1, disappears after this turn.\n> \n> Food at (6,1) is under body, but I can try to eat it later if I can get the head there when the body moves away.\n> \n> Food at (5,4) is on tail, but since head and tail adjacent, eating it is fatal, so I should avoid it for now.\n> \n> Perhaps later when they are not adjacent, I can eat it.\n> \n> Life span 10, so I have time.\n> \n> Now, after moving, the snake will shift.\n> \n> If I move Up to (6,5), new head position (6,5), then the body: (6,4) becomes new body segment 1, (6,3) segment 2, and so on, down to (5,4) which was tail, but since no food eaten, tail moves away.\n> \n> Current snake positions: let's list indices:\n> \n> 0: head (6,4)\n> \n> 1: (6,3)\n> \n> 2: (6,2)\n> \n> 3: (6,1)\n> \n> 4: (5,1)\n> \n> 5: (4,1)\n> \n> 6: (3,1)\n> \n> 7: (2,1)\n> \n> 8: (2,2)\n> \n> 9: (3,2)\n> \n> 10: (4,2)  // food here, but occupied\n> \n> 11: (4,3)\n> \n> 12: (5,3)\n> \n> 13: tail (5,4)\n> \n> If I move head to (6,5), no food eaten, so new positions:\n> \n> Head: (6,5)\n> \n> Then body: (6,4) [previous head], (6,3) [prev seg1], (6,2) [prev seg2], (6,1) [prev seg3], (5,1) [prev seg4], (4,1) [prev seg5], (3,1) [prev seg6], (2,1) [prev seg7], (2,2) [prev seg8], (3,2) [prev seg9], (4,2) [prev seg10], (4,3) [prev seg11], (5,3) [prev seg12], and tail was (5,4), but since no growth, tail moves off, so (5,4) is vacated, and the new tail is (5,3)?

After move, the segment that was at (4,2) is now at... prev seg10 was at (4,2), and after move, since head moved, all body segments shift: seg10 moves to where seg11 was? No.\n> \n> Standard: when head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment in the chain.\n> \n> So, the first body segment (index 1) moves to where head was (6,4)\n> \n> Index 2 moves to where index 1 was (6,3)\n> \n> Index 3 moves to where index 2 was (6,2)\n> \n> ...\n> \n> Index 10 moves to where index 9 was (3,2)?

It's turn 53, and the grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so coordinates go from (0,0) to (7,7). Internal obstacles are at (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4). Snake positions are given: head at (6,5), then (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3). That's 14 segments. Head direction is Up, which is consistent since from (6,5) to (6,4) is down? No: head is at (6,5), and the next segment is (6,4), so moving from head to (6,4) is downward, but the direction is given as Up? That might be a mistake.\n> \n> Snake positions: [(6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), ...] so head is (6,5), and the second segment is (6,4), which is below it, so the snake is moving downward. But head direction is given as \"U\" for Up. That can't be right. If head is at (6,5) and moving to (6,4), that's decreasing y, so Down direction. But it says \"Snake Head Direction: U\". Perhaps it's the current facing direction, not the movement direction? Let me read carefully.\n> \n> It says \"Snake Head Direction: U\", and positions show head at (6,5), then (6,4), so if it was moving Down, direction should be D. But it says U. Maybe it's the direction it's facing, which might imply the last move was Up? But from positions, it moved from (6,6) or something to (6,5)? Positions start from head, so (6,5) is head, then (6,4) is next, so it came from above, meaning last move was Down to reach (6,5)? I'm confused.\n> \n> Perhaps the direction is the intended next move or current orientation. But the problem says \"Snake Head Direction\" which I think is the direction it is currently facing, meaning the last move was in that direction. But in this case, if head is at (6,5) and previous was (6,6), then direction should be D. But positions don't show (6,6); the list is [(6,5), (6,4), ...], so head at (6,5), then (6,4), so the snake is extending downward, meaning it moved down to get to (6,5) from some previous position not listed? The positions are the current positions, so the head is at (6,5), and it was at (6,6) before, but (6,6) isn't in the list because it moved. I think I need to infer the direction from the positions and the given direction.\n> \n> Given direction is U, but from positions, between head and second segment: head (6,5), second (6,4), so dy = -1, so last move was Down. But direction is given as U, which is inconsistent. Perhaps \"Snake Head Direction\" is the direction the head is pointing, which for the next move, it can't instantly reverse to Down; it can go Left, Right, or Up, but not Down.\n> \n> Yes, that makes sense. The direction is the current facing direction, which constrains the next move. So, head direction U means the snake is facing Up, so it can move Up, Left, or Right, but not Down (since that would be instant reverse).\n> \n> In terms of position, if head is at (6,5) and facing Up, that means it came from below, so last position was (6,4)? But in the positions, (6,4) is the second segment. Let's list all positions:\n> \n> Index 0: (6,5) head\n> \n> Index 1: (6,4)\n> \n> Index 2: (6,3)\n> \n> Index 3: (6,2)\n> \n> Index 4: (6,1)\n> \n> Index 5: (5,1)\n> \n> Index 6: (4,1)\n> \n> Index 7: (3,1)\n> \n> Index 8: (2,1)\n> \n> Index 9: (2,2)\n> \n> Index 10: (3,2)\n> \n> Index 11: (4,2)\n> \n> Index 12: (4,3)\n> \n> Index 13: (5,3)\n> \n> So, from head (6,5) to (6,4), it must have moved down to get there, but the direction is given as U. I think there might be a misunderstanding. Probably, the head direction is the direction it is currently facing, which is based on the last move. Since it moved from (6,6) to (6,5) by moving down, but (6,6) isn't in the list; the list is current positions. At turn 53, the head is at (6,5), and it arrived there from, say, (6,6) at turn 52, but since it moved down, the head direction should be D. But the state says \"U\". This is confusing.\n> \n> Perhaps the direction is the direction for the next move. But the problem says \"Snake Head Direction\" and in the context, it's part of the state, so it should be the current direction to prevent instant reverse.\n> \n> I think I should trust the given direction. It says head direction U, so for turn 53, the snake is facing Up, so it can move U, L, or R, but not D.\n> \n> Similarly, the positions show it at (6,5) with (6,4) below, so if it moves U, it would go to (6,6), but y=6 is within bounds? Walls at y=0 and y=7, so y=6 is ok, x=6 is between 0 and 7.\n> \n> But let's proceed with the given: head at (6,5), direction U, so possible moves: U to (6,6), L to (5,5), R to (7,5). But x=7 is wall? Walls: border cells x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7, so (7,5) has x=7, which is wall, so R is invalid. Similarly, y=6 is not wall, x=6 is not wall. Also, internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4). (5,5) is not an obstacle, (6,6) is not.\n> \n> So from (6,5), with direction U, possible moves:\n> \n> - U: to (6,6)\n> \n> - L: to (5,5)\n> \n> - R: to (7,5) but x=7 wall, so invalid.\n> \n> R is invalid because x=7 is wall. So only U or L possible? D is not possible due to instant reverse rule.\n> \n> But L to (5,5) is possible? (5,5) is not occupied by snake or obstacle? Snake positions: head at (6,5), body at (6,4), (6,3), etc., down to (5,3). (5,5) is not in the list, so it's empty. Similarly, (6,6) is empty.\n> \n> Also, food: there are two food items:\n> \n> - (6,1, 7, 1) that is position (6,1), value 1, life span 7\n> \n> - (5,4, 9, 1) position (5,4), value 1, life span 9\n> \n> Both are positive food since value +1.\n> \n> Life span: for (6,1) is 7, meaning it disappears after 7 turns, including current turn? The problem says \"life_span\" and \"disappears after N turns\", \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So for turn 53, if life span is 7, it will disappear after turn 53 + 7 - 1? Let's see: countdown decreases every turn including current, so at turn t, with life span N, it will be gone after N turns, meaning it lasts from turn t to turn t + N - 1? For example, at turn t, life span N, it exists for turns t, t+1, ..., t+N-1, and disappears at turn t+N.\n> \n> Similarly here, food at (6,1) with life span 7 at turn 53, so it exists from turn 53 to turn 53+6=59?

Similarly, (5,4) with life_span=8, disappears at turn 62.\n> \n> But (6,1) is one of the snake positions? Snake positions include (6,1), which is segment 5 or 6? Positions: (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), ... so (6,1) is occupied by the snake body.\n> \n> But food can spawn under the body, as per rules. So food at (6,1) is under the snake body.

Similarly, (6,1) is occupied.\n> \n> Current head position: (6,6), direction U (up). But moving up to (6,7) is impossible because y=7 is wall. So from (6,6), possible moves are U, D, L, R but U to (6,7) wall, so not possible.\n> \n> D to (6,5) but (6,5) is the body segment, but it's the second segment. When snake moves, the head moves to a new cell, and tail moves away, so if head moves to (6,5), which is currently occupied by the first body segment, but after move, that segment will be the new head position? No.\n> \n> Let's think carefully.\n> \n> In snake, when you move, the head moves to an adjacent cell. If that cell is the tail, it's ok because tail moves away. If it's another body segment, it's collision.\n> \n> Here, from (6,6), possible adjacent cells:\n> \n> - Up: (6,7) - y=7, wall, invalid\n> \n> - Down: (6,5) - currently occupied by body segment (6,5). Since the snake will move, if head goes to (6,5), which is where the next segment is, but after move, the segment at (6,5) will move to (6,6) or something? Standard snake movement: when head moves to a cell, if it's not food, the tail end is removed. But if head moves to a cell occupied by body, it collides unless it's the tail.\n> \n> Specifically, (6,5) is the position of the first body segment. After one move, if head moves to (6,5), then the segment that was at (6,5) will move to where? The new head is at (6,5), then the body segments follow: the old head (6,6) becomes the new segment 1 at (6,6)? Let's simulate.\n> \n> Current positions: head (6,6), seg1 (6,5), seg2 (6,4), ..., tail (4,3)\n> \n> If head moves down to (6,5), which is where seg1 is. But after the move, the new head is at (6,5), and seg1 must move to the old head position? No.\n> \n> In snake movement, each segment moves to the position of the previous segment in the list.\n> \n> So when head moves to a new cell, say to (6,5), but (6,5) is currently occupied by seg1, so if head moves there, it would be on top of seg1, which causes collision because the cell is occupied before the move, and after move, seg1 moves to (6,6) or something? It's messy.\n> \n> Typically, in snake, the head moves to an adjacent cell. If that cell is empty or food, it's fine. If it's a body segment, it depends: if it's the tail, it's ok because tail moves away; if it's another segment, it's collision.\n> \n> Here, (6,5) is not the tail; it's the first body segment, so moving to (6,5) would cause head to collide with body.\n> \n> Similarly, moving to (7,6) is x=7, wall, invalid.\n> \n> Moving to (5,6) is left, which is adjacent.\n> \n> Possible moves from (6,6):\n> \n> - Up: (6,7) - wall, invalid\n> \n> - Down: (6,5) - body segment, collision\n> \n> - Left: (5,6) - what is this cell? Is it free? Let's see.\n> \n> (5,6) is not in snake positions: snake has (6,6), (6,5), etc., no (5,6). Not a wall? Walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 borders, internal obstacles (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4). (5,6) not listed, so free cell.\n> \n> - Right: (7,6) - x=7, border wall, invalid.\n> \n> So only possible move is left to (5,6)? But head direction is U, but we can change direction.\n> \n> Also, no instant reverse: since last move was up (to (6,6) from (6,5)? Positions show head at (6,6), and previous was (6,5), so it moved up.

Since life span decreases every turn including current, at turn 54, life_span=6, after turn 54, it becomes 5, and so on, down to 0 at turn 60, when it disappears. So it can be eaten from turn 54 to 59, but since it's under body, it needs to be exposed.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (5,4): life_span 8, so from turn 54 to 61.\n> \n> Now, snake is at (6,6), moving to (5,6).\n> \n> After moving to (5,6), new head position (5,6), direction now L (since we moved left).\n> \n> New positions: head (5,6), then (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), and tail (4,3) removed, so new tail is (4,2)?

Let's not list all.\n> \n> Important: the food at (6,1) is currently under seg6. After move, if no food eaten, seg7 moves to (6,1)? In the new positions, after move to (4,6), body seg7 is at old seg6 position, which is (6,1), so (6,1) is still occupied by the body, now by seg7.\n> \n> Similarly, if we move down, (6,1) is still occupied.\n> \n> To free (6,1), we need the snake to move so that the segment on (6,1) moves away and no other segment occupies it immediately.\n> \n> Currently, (6,1) is occupied by a body segment. When the snake moves, that segment moves to the next position, and (6,1) might be free if no new segment moves there.\n> \n> In the move to (4,6), the segment that was on (6,1) moves to where? Old seg6 at (6,1) becomes new seg7 at (6,1)? After move:\n> \n> - New head: (4,6)\n> \n> - New seg1: (5,6)  // old head\n> \n> - New seg2: (6,6)  // old seg1\n> \n> - New seg3: (6,5)  // old seg2\n> \n> - New seg4: (6,4)  // old seg3\n> \n> - New seg5: (6,3)  // old seg4\n> \n> - New seg6: (6,2)  // old seg5\n> \n> - New seg7: (6,1)  // old seg6\n> \n> - New seg8: (5,1)  // old seg7\n> \n> - etc.\n> \n> So (6,1) is still occupied by new seg7.\n> \n> Similarly, if we move down to (5,5), new head (5,5), new seg1 (5,6), new seg2 (6,6), new seg3 (6,5), new seg4 (6,4), new seg5 (6,3), new seg6 (6,2), new seg7 (6,1), same thing.\n> \n> So after one move, (6,1) is still occupied.\n> \n> In fact, since the segment on (6,1) is moving to (6,2) or something? In the sequence, the segment that was on (6,1) is moving to the position of the previous segment when the snake moves.\n> \n> When the snake moves, each body segment moves to the position of the segment before it in the chain.\n> \n> The segment at position i moves to where position i-1 was, but since position i-1 has moved, it's the old position.\n> \n> After a move, the cell that was occupied by a body segment might be freed if it was the tail and no food eaten, but here (6,1) is not the tail; tail is at (4,2).\n> \n> The cell (6,1) will be freed only when the segment that is currently on it moves away and no other segment takes its place immediately, but since the segments are connected, when the snake moves, the segment on (6,1) moves to a new position, and the cell (6,1) is empty, unless the head or something moves there, but head is moving elsewhere.\n> \n> In the move, when the head moves to a new cell, and the tail moves off its cell if no food, then the cell that was tail is freed, but other cells might be freed temporarily if the snake is not straight.\n> \n> In this case, for (6,1), it is occupied by a body segment. When the snake moves, that segment moves to a different cell (depending on the move), and (6,1) is vacated. Then, no other segment moves to (6,1) immediately, so it becomes free, unless the head moves there, but head is moving to (4,6) or (5,5), not to (6,1).\n> \n> For example, if head moves to (4,6), the segment that was on (6,1) (old seg6) moves to where? After move, new seg7 is at old seg6 position, which is (6,1), but old seg6 was at (6,1), and after move, new seg7 is at (6,1), so it's still occupied.\n> \n> I think I'm confusing myself.\n> \n> Let's think of the positions before move: cells occupied: (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2)\n> \n> After head moves to (4,6):\n> \n> - New head at (4,6)\n> \n> - The body segment that was at (5,6) moves to (4,6)? No.\n> \n> The body segments shift: the first body segment is now at the old head position (5,6)\n> \n> The second body segment is at the old first body position (6,6)\n> \n> Third at old second (6,5)\n> \n> Fourth at old third (6,4)\n> \n> Fifth at old fourth (6,3)\n> \n> Sixth at old fifth (6,2)\n> \n> Seventh at old sixth (6,1)  // so (6,1) is still occupied by the seventh segment\n> \n> Eighth at old seventh (5,1)\n> \n> Ninth at old eighth (4,1)\n> \n> Tenth at old ninth (3,1)\n> \n> Eleventh at old tenth (2,1)\n> \n> Twelfth at old eleventh (2,2)\n> \n> Thirteenth at old twelfth (3,2)\n> \n> The old tail (4,2) is vacated because the segment that was there moved to (3,2), so (4,2) is now free.\n> \n> But for (6,1), it is still occupied by the new seventh segment.\n> \n> Similarly, if head moves down to (5,5):\n> \n> New head at (5,5)\n> \n> Body seg1 at old head (5,6)\n> \n> Seg2 at old seg1 (6,6)\n> \n> Seg3 at old seg2 (6,5)\n> \n> Seg4 at old seg3 (6,4)\n> \n> Seg5 at old seg4 (6,3)\n> \n> Seg6 at old seg5 (6,2)\n> \n> Seg7 at old seg6 (6,1)  // still occupied\n> \n> Seg8 at old seg7 (5,1)\n> \n> etc.\n> \n> So (6,1) remains occupied until the segment on it moves further.\n> \n> The segment on (6,1) is currently the sixth segment in the list, but after moves, it moves to different positions.\n> \n> To free (6,1), we need the snake to move in such a way that the segment that was on (6,1) moves away, and the cell is not occupied by another segment immediately.\n> \n> Since the snake is moving, when the segment on (6,1) moves to its next position, (6,1) is left empty, and it stays empty until the head or something moves there, but in this case, for the food to be eatable, we need to move the head to (6,1) after it's free.\n> \n> Currently, (6,1) is occupied, so we can't move there.\n> \n> After one move, as above, (6,1) is still occupied.\n> \n> After two moves, it might be free, depending on the moves.\n> \n> Let's simulate.\n> \n> Suppose at turn 55, we move left to (4,6).\n> \n> Then positions at turn 56: head (4,6), body (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2) tail at (3,2)\n> \n> (6,1) occupied by seg7.\n> \n> Now from (4,6), head direction: since we moved L to (4,6), new direction is L, so can move L, U, D, not R.\n> \n> Possible moves: L to (3,6), U to (4,7) wall, invalid, D to (4,5), R to (5,6) but (5,6) is body, and R is opposite to L? Current direction L, moving R would be instant reverse, prohibited, so only L to (3,6) or D to (4,5).\n> \n> (3,6) and (4,5) are free? (3,6) not occupied, no obstacle. (4,5) not occupied.\n> \n> Say we move D to (4,5).\n> \n> Then turn 57: head (4,5), body (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2) tail at (2,2)\n> \n> (6,1) still occupied by seg9? Positions: head (4,5), seg1 (4,6), seg2 (5,6), seg3 (6,6), seg4 (6,5), seg5 (6,4), seg6 (6,3), seg7 (6,2), seg8 (6,1), etc. yes, seg8 at (6,1).\n> \n> Still occupied.\n> \n> If we keep moving, the segment on (6,1) will eventually move when the tail advances.\n> \n> The segment on (6,1) is part of the body, and it will move to the next position as the snake moves, so (6,1) will be freed when that segment moves off it and no other segment takes its place immediately, which happens when the snake moves and that segment is not the one staying.\n> \n> In this snake, the body is mostly vertical on the right, so to free (6,1), we need the snake to move so that the tail shortens or something, but since no food eaten, tail doesn't shorten.\n> \n> The only way to free a body-occupied cell is to move the snake such that the segment on it moves away, and the cell is vacated.\n> \n> For (6,1), it will be freed when the segment that was on it moves to a new position, which happens on each move for that segment.\n> \n> But in the new positions, another segment might be on it if the snake loops, but here the snake is not looping.\n> \n> In the current configuration, the cell (6,1) is occupied by a segment that is not the tail. When the snake moves, that segment moves to the position of the segment before it in the chain, so for example, the segment at (6,1) will move to (6,2) if the head moves left or down, but in my earlier simulation, when head moves, the segment at (6,1) moves to (6,2) if the move is such that the previous segment moves to (6,2), but it's messy.\n> \n> Let's think the cell (6,1) is currently occupied. After a move, the segment that was on (6,1) will be on a new cell, and the cell (6,1) will be empty for that instant, unless the head moves to it, but head is not moving to it.\n> \n> In the new state, the cell (6,1) is not occupied by any segment if no segment moves to it.\n> \n> In the move to (4,6), the new positions are as above, and (6,1) is occupied by new seg7.\n> \n> But the old position (6,1) is now occupied by the same segment, but the cell is the same.\n> \n> The key point is that after the move, the cell that was occupied by a non-tail body segment may still be occupied if the segment doesn't move far, but in this case, for (6,1), it is still occupied after the move because the segment that was there is still there in the new state? No.\n> \n> Before move, cell (6,1) is occupied by a segment.\n> \n> After the move, that segment has moved to a different cell. In the new state, the segment that was at (6,1) is now at the position it moved to, and the cell (6,1) is now occupied by a different segment or free.\n> \n> In the example, when head moves to (4,6), the segment that was at (6,1) (old seg6) is now at new position: in the new body, the segment that was old seg6 is now new seg7 at (6,1)?

Snake positions: (4,6) head, (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), etc. (4,5) not in snake positions? Let's list all snake cells: (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2)\n> \n> (4,5) is not listed, so it should be free, unless obstacle.\n> \n> Obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4) – (4,5) not here, so free.\n> \n> L: (3,6) – is (3,6) free? Not in snake positions: (3,6) not listed, and obstacles: (1,2),(1,4),(1,5),(4,4),(5,2) – (3,6) not obstacle, so free.\n> \n> R: (5,6) but (5,6) is snake body, and also reverse move, so invalid.\n> \n> So possible moves: D to (4,5) or L to (3,6).\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> Also, food life spans: (6,1) has life span 4, meaning it disappears after 4 turns, including current turn? \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So at turn 56, life span 4, so it will disappear after turn 56+4-1? Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Life-span disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So for food at (6,1) with life span 4 at turn 56:\n> \n> - Turn 56: life span 4\n> \n> - After turn 56, it decreases, so turn 57: life span 3\n> \n> - Turn 58: life span 2\n> \n> - Turn 59: life span 1\n> \n> - Turn 60: life span 0, disappears? Or after N turns, meaning it exists for N turns including current?\n> \n> The rule: \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> I think it means that at the start, life span is N, and after each turn, it decreases by 1. When it reaches 0, it disappears.\n> \n> So for (6,1): life span 4 at turn 56, so:\n> \n> - Turn 56: available\n> \n> - Turn 57: available, life span 3\n> \n> - Turn 58: available, life span 2\n> \n> - Turn 59: available, life span 1\n> \n> - Turn 60: disappears, not available\n> \n> Similarly, (5,4): life span 6 at turn 56, so available until turn 61? Turn 56:6, 57:5, ..., 61:1, 62:0 disappear? Let's count:\n> \n> Start turn 56: life span N\n> \n> After turn 56: life span N-1\n> \n> After turn 57: N-2\n> \n> ...\n> \n> After turn (56 + N - 1): life span 1\n> \n> After turn (56 + N): life span 0, disappears.\n> \n> For (6,1) N=4:\n> \n> After turn 56: life span 3 (turn 57)\n> \n> After turn 57: life span 2 (turn 58)\n> \n> After turn 58: life span 1 (turn 59)\n> \n> After turn 59: life span 0 (turn 60), so disappears before turn 60 or at turn 60? The rule says \"disappears after N turns\", so I think it is present on turns when life span >0.\n> \n> Typically, if life span is L at turn t, it is available on turn t, and for L more turns, so available until turn t + L - 1.\n> \n> For example, turn t: life span L, available.\n> \n> After turn t (turn t+1): life span L-1, available if L-1>0.\n> \n> ...\n> \n> After turn t + L - 2: life span 1, available on turn t + L - 1\n> \n> After turn t + L - 1: life span 0, not available on turn t + L.\n> \n> So for (6,1) at turn 56, L=4: available on turns 56,57,58,59; disappears on turn 60.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,4) L=6: available turns 56 to 61 (since 56+6-1=61), disappear turn 62.\n> \n> (2,4) L=9: available turns 56 to 64, disappear turn 65.\n> \n> Now, back to moves.\n> \n> From head (4,6), I can go D to (4,5) or L to (3,6).\n> \n> If I go D to (4,5), then head moves to (4,5), and the snake body follows. Since we move, the tail moves away from (3,2), so the cell (3,2) is freed.\n> \n> Similarly, if I go L to (3,6), head to (3,6), body follows.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan a sequence for multiple turns.\n> \n> Also, consider the food at (6,1). It's under the snake body, at (6,1), which is occupied by the 7th segment (index 7). To eat it, the body must move away, meaning that segment moves, so (6,1) is vacated, then head moves onto it.\n> \n> But the head is at (4,6), which is far, so it might take several turns to reach (6,1).\n> \n> Similarly, other food.\n> \n> First, let's assess the risks.\n> \n> The snake is quite long, 14 segments. Positions list has 14 elements, so length 14.\n> \n> If I eat food, length increases by 1 for positive food.\n> \n> Now, the grid has obstacles, so I need to avoid walls and obstacles.\n> \n> Also, avoid colliding with body.\n> \n> But since tail moves, moving into tail position is ok if tail moves away.\n> \n> Now, let's find a path to food or safe areas.\n> \n> First, possible immediate moves:\n> \n> Option 1: Move D to (4,5)\n> \n> Then snake: new head (4,5), then body: old head (4,6) becomes segment 1, then (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1) moves to? When head moves to (4,5), the segment that was at (3,2) is removed? No.\n> \n> When snake moves, the head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, and the tail position is vacated, unless we eat food.\n> \n> If we don't eat food, tail is removed, so snake length same.\n> \n> If we eat food, tail is not removed, so length increases.\n> \n> In this case, if I move to (4,5), and (4,5) has no food (food is at (6,1), (5,4), (2,4), not (4,5)), so no food eaten. So new head (4,5), then body: (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2). The tail (3,2) is removed, so positions: head (4,5), seg1 (4,6), seg2 (5,6), seg3 (6,6), seg4 (6,5), seg5 (6,4), seg6 (6,3), seg7 (6,2), seg8 (6,1), seg9 (5,1), seg10 (4,1), seg11 (3,1), seg12 (2,1), seg13 (2,2). Old tail (3,2) gone, so now 13 segments? Original 14 segments, after move without eating, length decreases by one? No.\n> \n> Snake has length L, after move to empty cell, head moves to new position, body shifts, tail position is freed, so new length is L, but the segments are the same except head new and tail removed.\n> \n> Original positions: 14 cells occupied.\n> \n> After move: head moves to new cell, say C_new, which was empty. Then the body: the segment that was at position i moves to position i-1 for i=1 to L-1, so the segment that was at tail position L-1 is removed, and cell vacated.\n> \n> New head at C_new, new segment 1 at old head position, segment 2 at old segment 1 position, ..., segment L-1 at old segment L-2 position. The old segment L-1 (tail) position is vacated.\n> \n> So number of segments is still L, but the tail cell changes.\n> \n> In this case, L=14, after move to (4,5), new head (4,5), new segment 1: (4,6) (old head), segment 2: (5,6) (old seg1), segment 3: (6,6) (old seg2), segment 4: (6,5) (old seg3), segment 5: (6,4) (old seg4), segment 6: (6,3) (old seg5), segment 7: (6,2) (old seg6), segment 8: (6,1) (old seg7), segment 9: (5,1) (old seg8), segment 10: (4,1) (old seg9), segment 11: (3,1) (old seg10), segment 12: (2,1) (old seg11), segment 13: (2,2) (old seg12). Old tail was (3,2) (old seg13), which is removed, so new tail is (2,2), and (3,2) is free.\n> \n> So snake now has 13 segments? Original 14 segments, after move, we have 13 segments because tail was removed. Length decreases only if no food eaten.\n> \n> Original: 14 segments.\n> \n> After move: new head + segments from old head to old second last. So new positions: new head, then old head, old seg1, ..., old seg12. That's 14 positions? Let's index.\n> \n> Old positions: 0: head, 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13: tail\n> \n> After move to new cell, no food: new head at new cell, new segment 1 at old position 0, new segment 2 at old position 1, ..., new segment 13 at old position 12. Old position 13 is vacated. So new snake has segments from new head and old 0 to 12, that's 13 segments? New head, plus old 0 to 12 is 13 positions, but old 0 to 12 are 13 positions, plus new head is 14? Let's list:\n> \n> - New segment 0: new position (e.g. (4,5))\n> \n> - New segment 1: old position 0 ( (4,6) )\n> \n> - New segment 2: old position 1 ( (5,6) )\n> \n> - New segment 3: old position 2 ( (6,6) )\n> \n> - New segment 4: old position 3 ( (6,5) )\n> \n> - ...\n> - New segment 13: old position 12 ( (3,2) )? Old position 12 is (2,2), let's see old indices.\n> \n> Old: pos 0: (4,6), 1: (5,6), 2: (6,6), 3: (6,5), 4: (6,4), 5: (6,3), 6: (6,2), 7: (6,1), 8: (5,1), 9: (4,1), 10: (3,1), 11: (2,1), 12: (2,2), 13: (3,2)\n> \n> After move to (4,5), no food:\n> \n> - New head: (4,5)  - new pos 0\n> \n> - New pos 1: old pos 0 (4,6)\n> \n> - New pos 2: old pos 1 (5,6)\n> \n> - New pos 3: old pos 2 (6,6)\n> \n> - New pos 4: old pos 3 (6,5)\n> \n> - New pos 5: old pos 4 (6,4)\n> \n> - New pos 6: old pos 5 (6,3)\n> \n> - New pos 7: old pos 6 (6,2)\n> \n> - New pos 8: old pos 7 (6,1)\n> \n> - New pos 9: old pos 8 (5,1)\n> \n> - New pos 10: old pos 9 (4,1)\n> \n> - New pos 11: old pos 10 (3,1)\n> \n> - New pos 12: old pos 11 (2,1)\n> \n> - New pos 13: old pos 12 (2,2)\n> \n> Old pos 13 (3,2) is vacated. So new tail is new pos 13: (2,2), and length is 14 segments? New pos 0 to 13 is 14 positions.\n> \n> New pos 0: (4,5)\n> \n> New pos 1: (4,6)\n> \n> New pos 2: (5,6)\n> \n> New pos 3: (6,6)\n> \n> New pos 4: (6,5)\n> \n> New pos 5: (6,4)\n> \n> New pos 6: (6,3)\n> \n> New pos 7: (6,2)\n> \n> New pos 8: (6,1)\n> \n> New pos 9: (5,1)\n> \n> New pos 10: (4,1)\n> \n> New pos 11: (3,1)\n> \n> New pos 12: (2,1)\n> \n> New pos 13: (2,2)\n> \n> Old (3,2) gone. So the snake still has 14 segments, but the tail is now at (2,2), and (3,2) free.\n> \n> In this case, for (6,1), it is still occupied by the snake, at new pos 8.\n> \n> Similarly, if I move L to (3,6), let's see.\n> \n> But for now, back to decision.\n> \n> From (4,6), moves:\n> \n> - D to (4,5): free cell\n> \n> - L to (3,6): free cell\n> \n> U and R invalid.\n> \n> Now, (4,5) is below, (3,6) is left.\n> \n> Food at (5,4), (2,4), and (6,1) but (6,1) is under body.\n> \n> (5,4) is at row 4, col 5, which is not occupied by snake currently? Snake has (6,4) at index 4, (6,4) is occupied, but (5,4) is free? Snake positions: (6,4) is there, but (5,4) is not in the list, and no obstacle, so free, with food.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,4) free with food.\n> \n> (6,1) occupied, with food under it.\n> \n> To eat (6,1), we need to vacate (6,1) and have head there.\n> \n> Since (6,1) is occupied by a body segment, when that segment moves, (6,1) is vacated, then if head can move there, it can eat.\n> \n> But head is far, at (4,6).\n> \n> The segment at (6,1) is part of the body. When the snake moves, that segment will move to the next position.\n> \n> For example, if we move down to (4,5), as above, the segment at (6,1) moves to (6,2)? In the new positions, (6,1) is now occupied by new pos 8, which came from old pos 7 (6,1), but in the move, when head moves down, the body shifts, so the segment that was at (6,1) will move to where the previous segment was, but it's a chain.\n> \n> In the move to (4,5), the segment that was at (6,1) (old pos 7) moves to where old pos 6 was, which is (6,2).\n> \n> Old pos 6: (6,2), so new pos 7: (6,2), which was old pos 6.\n> \n> New pos 8: (6,1), which is old pos 7, so the cell (6,1) is still occupied by the same segment? No, the segment moves to a new cell.\n> \n> Let's clarify: each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment in the list.\n> \n> So for body segment i, it moves to the position of old segment i-1.\n> \n> For i=1, it moves to old head position.\n> \n> For i>1, it moves to old position i-1.\n> \n> The position it leaves is vacated if not occupied by new segment.\n> \n> In this case, for (6,1), which is old pos 7, it will move to old pos 6, which is (6,2). So it leaves (6,1) vacated, and moves to (6,2).\n> \n> But (6,2) was occupied by old pos 6, which moves to old pos 5, and so on.\n> \n> In the move to (4,5), new head at (4,5), new pos 1 at old pos 0 (4,6), new pos 2 at old pos 1 (5,6), new pos 3 at old pos 2 (6,6), new pos 4 at old pos 3 (6,5), new pos 5 at old pos 4 (6,4), new pos 6 at old pos 5 (6,3), new pos 7 at old pos 6 (6,2), new pos 8 at old pos 7 (6,1), so new pos 8 is at (6,1), so (6,1) is still occupied by the body, but by a different segment. The cell (6,1) is still occupied after the move, because new pos 8 is at (6,1).\n> \n> Old pos 7 was at (6,1), and new pos 8 is also at (6,1), so it doesn't vacate. When the snake moves, the segment that was at old pos 7 moves to the position of old pos 6, which is (6,2), so it leaves (6,1) and moves to (6,2).\n> \n> But new pos 8 is the segment that was at old pos 7, and it moves to (6,2)? I think I confused the indices.\n> \n> Let's think of the positions.\n> \n> Before move: cells occupied: (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2)\n> \n> After moving head to (4,5):\n> \n> - The head moves to (4,5)\n> \n> - The segment that was at (4,6) (head) is now the body at (4,6)\n> \n> - The segment that was at (5,6) moves to (5,6) but no, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> - The first body segment (after head) moves to the old head position, which is (4,6)\n> \n> - The second body segment moves to the old position of the first body segment, which is (5,6)\n> \n> - The third body segment moves to the old position of the second, which is (6,6)\n> \n> - And so on.\n> \n> - The last body segment (tail) moves to the position of the second last, and the old tail position is vacated.\n> \n> In terms of positions:\n> \n> - New head: (4,5)\n> \n> - New position 1 (first body): old position 0, (4,6)\n> \n> - New position 2: old position 1, (5,6)\n> \n> - New position 3: old position 2, (6,6)\n> \n> - New position 4: old position 3, (6,5)\n> \n> - New position 5: old position 4, (6,4)\n> \n> - New position 6: old position 5, (6,3)\n> \n> - New position 7: old position 6, (6,2)\n> \n> - New position 8: old position 7, (6,1)  -- so the segment that was at (6,1) moves to old position 6, which is (6,2), so it leaves (6,1) and goes to (6,2)\n> \n> - New position 8 is at old position 7, which is (6,1), but the segment that was at old position 7 is now at new position 8, which is at (6,1), so the cell (6,1) is still occupied by the same segment?

No.\n> \n> New position 8 is the position of the segment, which is old position 7, (6,1). So after the move, new position 8 is at (6,1), so (6,1) is still occupied.\n> \n> But when the snake moves, the segments shift, so the segment that was at (6,1) (old pos 7) moves to the position that was previously occupied by the segment ahead of it, which is old pos 6 (6,2).\n> \n> So it moves from (6,1) to (6,2), so (6,1) is vacated, and (6,2) is now occupied by this segment.\n> \n> Similarly, the segment that was at (6,2) (old pos 6) moves to old pos 5 (6,3), and so on.\n> \n> Let's list the new positions:\n> \n> - New head: (4,5)  -- new cell\n> \n> - New body segment 1: at old head position, (4,6)\n> \n> - New body segment 2: at old body segment 1 position, (5,6)\n> \n> - New body segment 3: at old body segment 2 position, (6,6)\n> \n> - New body segment 4: at old body segment 3 position, (6,5)\n> \n> - New body segment 5: at old body segment 4 position, (6,4)\n> \n> - New body segment 6: at old body segment 5 position, (6,3)\n> \n> - New body segment 7: at old body segment 6 position, (6,2)  -- so the segment that was at (6,2) moves to (6,3)?

The segment that was at old body7 is now at new body7 or something.\n> \n> Let's list the new positions:\n> \n> After head moves to (4,5):\n> \n> - New positions:\n> - Head: (4,5)\n> - Body1: (4,6)  -- old head position\n> - Body2: (5,6)  -- old body1 position\n> - Body3: (6,6)  -- old body2 position\n> - Body4: (6,5)  -- old body3 position\n> - Body5: (6,4)  -- old body4 position\n> - Body6: (6,3)  -- old body5 position\n> - Body7: (6,2)  -- old body6 position\n> - Body8: (6,1)  -- old body7 position\n> - Body9: (5,1)  -- old body8 position\n> - etc.\n> \n> So the cell (6,1) is now occupied by new body8, which is the same as old body7 position, so it is still occupied.\n> \n> The segment that was at old body7 is now at new body8, at the same cell (6,1), so it didn't move; the position is the same.\n> \n> For cells that are not the tail, if the snake moves without changing direction in a straight line, the body segments don't move relative to their cells if it's straight, but in this case, the head moved down, so the body shifted.\n> \n> But for (6,1), it is still occupied after the move.\n> \n> To vacate (6,1), the segment that is there must move away, which happens when the snake moves and that particular segment is not the last, so it moves to the next position.\n> \n> In this case, for (6,1), it is occupied by a body segment, and when the snake moves, that segment will move to the position of the previous segment, so it leaves (6,1) only if it moves to a different cell.\n> \n> In the move to (4,5), the segment at (6,1) (old body7) moves to old body6 position, which is (6,2), so it leaves (6,1) and goes to (6,2).\n> \n> Then new body8 is at old body7 position (6,1), but which segment is that? New body8 is the segment that was at old body8, which was (5,1), and it moves to old body7 position (6,1).\n> \n> So the segment from (5,1) moves to (6,1), so (6,1) is occupied by a different segment.\n> \n> The cell (6,1) is vacated for a moment, but immediately occupied by the next segment.\n> \n> In terms of the grid, during the move, the cells are updated simultaneously, so (6,1) is never free; it is always occupied by some segment after the move.\n> \n> For food under the body, to be eaten, the body must move away, meaning that at some turn, the cell is vacated, and then the head moves to it.\n> \n> But in this case, when the snake moves, the body segments shift, so if a body cell is not the tail, it may be vacated if the segment moves and no other segment moves into it immediately, but in the shift, the cell is occupied by the following segment.\n> \n> For example, when the snake moves, for a body cell that is not the tail, the segment leaves, and the cell is occupied by the segment from behind.\n> \n> So the cell is never free; it changes occupancy.\n> \n> Only the tail cell is vacated when the tail moves.\n> \n> For food under a body segment that is not the tail, it can only be eaten if that segment is the last to move or something, but in standard snake, it's not possible to eat food under the body unless it's at the tail position and the tail moves away.\n> \n> Let's read the rule: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> \"The body moves away\" means that the segment that was on that cell moves off it, vacating the cell.\n> \n> Then, later, the head must move onto it.\n> \n> In the case of (6,1), it is occupied by a body segment. When the snake moves, that segment moves to a new position, so it leaves (6,1), and at the same time, the segment behind it moves to (6,1), so (6,1) is not vacated; it is immediately reoccupied.\n> \n> Therefore, for a body cell that is not the tail, when the snake moves, the cell is never free; it is always occupied.\n> \n> Only when the tail moves, the tail cell is vacated and not reoccupied.\n> \n> For food under a non-tail body segment, it can only be eaten if that segment is the tail, or if the snake turns in such a way that the cell is skipped or something, but in a grid with adjacent moves, it's hard.\n> \n> In this case, for (6,1), it is not the tail; the tail is at (3,2), so (6,1) is a middle segment.\n> \n> So to vacate (6,1), the snake must move in a way that the segment at (6,1) moves away and no segment moves into it, which only happens if it is the tail.\n> \n> Otherwise, it's always occupied.\n> \n> The rule says \"the body moves away\", but in practice, for non-tail segments, it doesn't move away; it is replaced by another segment.\n> \n> So probably, food under non-tail body segments cannot be eaten, or only if that segment becomes the tail later.\n> \n> But in this case, (6,1) is not the tail, and the tail is far away.\n> \n> So it might not be possible to eat (6,1) easily.\n> \n> Perhaps when the snake moves, if the body segment on the food moves and the cell is vacated for that instant, but since the head moves at the same time, if the head moves to that cell, it can eat, but the head is far.\n> \n> In this turn, head is at (4,6), (6,1) is far, so head cannot move to (6,1) in one move.\n> \n> So for (6,1), with life span 4, it might disappear before we can eat it.\n> \n> Similarly, for other food.\n> \n> Perhaps I should ignore (6,1) for now and focus on other food.\n> \n> Let's look at the food at (5,4) and (2,4).\n> \n> (5,4) is at row 4, col 5.\n> \n> Currently, is it occupied? Snake has (6,4) at index 4, (6,4) is occupied, but (5,4) is free, with food.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,4) free with food.\n> \n> Head at (4,6), I can move D to (4,5) or L to (3,6).\n> \n> If I move D to (4,5), then head at (4,5), direction down.\n> \n> From there, possible moves: U, D, L, R, but not opposite, so since moved D, cannot move U next turn.\n> \n> Cell (4,5): U to (4,6), but (4,6) is now body, occupied, so invalid if occupied, but after move, (4,6) is body, so cannot move there.\n> \n> Similarly, D to (4,4), but (4,4) is obstacle, internal obstacle at (4,4), so wall, invalid.\n> \n> L to (3,5), or R to (5,5).\n> \n> Let's list available from (4,5):\n> \n> After moving to (4,5), positions as above.\n> \n> Cells around (4,5):\n> - U: (4,6) - occupied by body, invalid\n> - D: (4,4) - obstacle, wall, invalid\n> - L: (3,5) - is it free? Not in snake positions, not obstacle, so free\n> - R: (5,5) - free? Not in snake, not obstacle, so free\n> \n> So from (4,5), can move L to (3,5) or R to (5,5).\n> \n> If I move L to (3,6) from current position.\n> \n> Current head (4,6), move L to (3,6).\n> \n> Then new head (3,6), body: old head (4,6) becomes body1, then (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), etc., tail at (2,2) removed, new tail at (2,1) or something.\n> \n> New positions:\n> - Head: (3,6)\n> - Body1: (4,6)\n> - Body2: (5,6)\n> - Body3: (6,6)\n> - Body4: (6,5)\n> - Body5: (6,4)\n> - Body6: (6,3)\n> - Body7: (6,2)\n> - Body8: (6,1)\n> - Body9: (5,1)\n> - Body10: (4,1)\n> - Body11: (3,1)\n> - Body12: (2,1)\n> - Body13: (2,2)  -- old tail (3,2) removed, so new tail (2,2)\n> \n> From (3,6), possible moves:\n> - U: (3,7) but y=7 wall, invalid\n> - D: (3,5) - free? Not occupied, not obstacle, free\n> - L: (2,6) - free? Not occupied, not obstacle, free\n> - R: (4,6) but (4,6) is body, occupied, invalid\n> \n> Also, current direction after move is L, so cannot move R (opposite) next turn, but R is invalid anyway.\n> \n> So can move D to (3,5) or L to (2,6).\n> \n> Now, let's think about the food.\n> \n> Food at (5,4) is at (5,4), which is below and right of head.\n> \n> From current position (4,6), if I move D to (4,5), then I am closer to (5,4).\n> \n> (5,4) is at (5,4), from (4,5), I can move R to (5,5), then from there to (5,4), but (5,4) has food, so if I move to (5,4), I eat it.\n> \n> Similarly, from (4,5), move L to (3,5), then I can go down or left to (2,4) food.\n> \n> But (2,4) is far.\n> \n> Also, life span: (6,1) has short life, only until turn 59, so 4 turns including current? Turn 56: available, 57,58,59; gone on 60.\n> \n> Current turn 56, so turns 56,57,58,59 available.\n> \n> (5,4) available until turn 61, (2,4) until turn 64.\n> \n> So (6,1) is time-sensitive.\n> \n> But to eat (6,1), we need to vacate it and have head there.\n> \n> Since it's under body, and not tail, it's difficult.\n> \n> The only way to vacate it is if the segment on it moves and no segment replaces it, which only happens if it is the tail when it moves.\n> \n> Currently, (6,1) is not the tail; tail is at (3,2).\n> \n> The tail will move as the snake moves.\n> \n> For example, if we move in a way that the tail moves away from (6,1), but (6,1) is occupied by a middle segment.\n> \n> The segment at (6,1) will only leave if the snake moves, and it moves to another cell, but as we saw, the cell is reoccupied.\n> \n> Unless that segment becomes the tail later.\n> \n> For example, if we don't eat food, the snake shortens as it moves, but the length decreases only if no food eaten, but the segments shift, so the segment at (6,1) will eventually become the tail if we don't eat.\n> \n> But it will take many turns.\n> \n> For example, from current position, after 7 moves without eating, the segment that was at (6,1) might be the tail or something.\n> \n> Let's see the distance.\n> \n> Head at (4,6), the segment at (6,1) is index 7, so it is 7 segments away from head.\n> \n> When the snake moves without eating, the tail is removed, so after each move, the segment that was second last becomes the new tail.\n> \n> After k moves without eating, the segment that was at position k from the tail becomes the new tail.\n> \n> Currently, tail is at index 13, (3,2).\n> \n> The segment at index 7, (6,1), is 6 positions away from tail (13-7=6).\n> \n> After 6 moves without eating, the segment that was at index 7 will be at index 7-6=1 or something.\n> \n> After one move, the new tail is old index 12.\n> \n> After two moves, new tail is old index 11, and so on.\n> \n> After k moves, the new tail is old index 13-k.\n> \n> For the segment at old index 7 to be the tail, we need 13-k =7, so k=6.\n> \n> After 6 moves without eating, the segment that was at index 7 will be the new tail.\n> \n> Then, when the snake moves again, the tail moves away, and (6,1) is vacated if it was the tail position.\n> \n> But after 6 moves, the position has changed.\n> \n> After k moves, the segment that was at position i is now at position i-k, but only if i-k >=0, else it is removed.\n> \n> For i=7, after k moves, if k<7, it is at position 7-k.\n> \n> After k moves, the segment at old position i is at new position i, but the indices shift.\n> \n> After one move, old position i is new position i+1 for i<13, and position 13 removed.\n> \n> After one move, the segment that was at old position j is at new position j for j from 0 to 12, but new position 0 is new head, new position 1 is old position 0, etc.\n> \n> The segment that was at old position i is at new position i+1 for i from 0 to 12, and new position 0 is new head.\n> \n> For body segments, the segment that was at old position i (i>=1) is at new position i for i from 1 to 12, but new position 1 is old position 0, new position 2 is old position 1, ..., new position 13 is old position 12.\n> \n> So the segment that was at old position i is at new position i+1 for i from 0 to 12, but for i=0, it is at new position 1, for i=1, at new position 2, ..., for i=12, at new position 13.\n> \n> The segment at old position 7 is at new position 8 after one move.\n> \n> After two moves, at new position 9, and so on.\n> \n> After k moves, at position 7+k.\n> \n> When it becomes the tail, position 7+k = 13, so k=6.\n> \n> After 6 moves, it is at position 13, the tail.\n> \n> Then on the 7th move, when the snake moves, the tail moves away, and the cell is vacated.\n> \n> For (6,1), the cell, not the segment.\n> \n> The segment moves, but the cell (6,1) may not be where it is.\n> \n> The segment that was at (6,1) will be at different positions.\n> \n> After k moves, it is at some position.\n> \n> But the food is at cell (6,1), so to eat the food at (6,1), we need the cell (6,1) to be vacated and head to move there.\n> \n> The cell (6,1) can be vacated only when the tail is there and moves away.\n> \n> Currently, the tail is at (3,2), not at (6,1).\n> \n> So we need to move so that the tail comes to (6,1) or something, but it's complicated.\n> \n> Perhaps it's not worth the effort for one food with short life span.\n> \n> I should focus on other food.\n> \n> Let's go for (5,4) or (2,4).\n> \n> (5,4) is closer.\n> \n> From head (4,6), move D to (4,5).\n> \n> Then from (4,5), I can move R to (5,5), then from (5,5) move D to (5,4) to eat the food on turn 58.\n> \n> Turn 56: move D to (4,5)\n> \n> Turn 57: from (4,5), move R to (5,5)\n> \n> Turn 58: from (5,5), move D to (5,4) eat food.\n> \n> Then length increases by 1.\n> \n> But after eating, tail doesn't move, so new

It ensures long-term survival by accessing the less cluttered bottom-left grid, where future food can be pursued with minimal collision risk.

So after 5 moves without eating, the tail would have moved, and the segment at (6,1) would be closer to tail, and after 6 moves, it might be tail if no growth.\n> \n> Let's think indices.\n> \n> Current positions: index 0: head (3,6), 1: (4,6), 2: (5,6), 3: (6,6), 4: (6,5), 5: (6,4), 6: (6,3), 7: (6,2), 8: (6,1), 9: (5,1), 10: (4,1), 11: (3,1), 12: (2,1), 13: tail (2,2)\n> \n> After one move without eating: head moves to new cell, say to (2,6) or (3,5), then the body: segment 1 moves to (3,6), 2 to (4,6), ..., 13 to (2,1), and tail (2,2) is removed.\n> \n> So the new snake: head at new pos, then (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1) — tail is (2,1).\n> \n> (6,1) is now at index 8? New indices: 0: new head, 1: (3,6), 2: (4,6), 3: (5,6), 4: (6,6), 5: (6,5), 6: (6,4), 7: (6,3), 8: (6,2), 9: (6,1), 10: (5,1), 11: (4,1), 12: (3,1), 13: (2,1)\n> \n> (6,1) was index 8, now it's at index 9, and (6,1) is still occupied, by the segment that was previously (5,1)? Let's see the cell: the cell (6,1) is now occupied by the segment that was at (6,2) or something.\n> \n> After move, the segment that was at index 1 moves to index 0's old position, but it's the positions that shift.\n> \n> The cell (6,1) is still occupied, but by a different segment. Specifically, the segment that was at (6,2) now moves to (6,1) if the snake moves down or something, but it depends on the movement.\n> \n> When the snake moves, each segment except head moves to the position of the previous segment in the list.\n> \n> So for cell (6,1), it was occupied by segment 8. After one move, segment 8 moves to where segment 7 was, which is (6,2), so if segment 7 was at (6,2), then segment 8 moves to (6,2), and (6,1) is now occupied by segment 9, which was at (5,1), but segment 9 moves to where segment 8 was, which is (6,1), so (6,1) is now occupied by the segment that was previously at (5,1).\n> \n> Generally, the cell (6,1) remains occupied until the tail passes it or something, but since the tail is at (2,2), it will take many moves to free (6,1).\n> \n> The distance from (6,1) to tail (2,2) in terms of path, but in terms of snake segments, it's 5 segments away as per indices.\n> \n> From above, after one move, (6,1) is still occupied, by the next segment.\n> \n> It will be occupied until the segment that is currently at a higher index moves away.\n> \n> The cell (6,1) will be freed when the segment that is currently at index 8 moves away from it, and no other segment moves to it immediately.\n> \n> But since the snake is moving, the only way (6,1) is freed is when the tail reaches that area, which is far.\n> \n> Specifically, the tail is at (2,2), and the snake is coiled, so to free (6,1), we need the tail to move past it, but it's not on the path.\n> \n> Currently, the snake has a body at (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2).\n> \n> So (6,1) is part of the body near the bottom left.\n> \n> When the snake moves, if we don't eat, the tail moves from (2,2) to, say, if we move, the tail cell is abandoned.\n> \n> But the cell (6,1) is occupied by a segment that will only move when the segments before it move.\n> \n> For example, if we move the head, the segment at index 1 moves to head old position, index 2 moves to index 1 old position, and so on, so the segment at index 8 moves to index 7 old position.\n> \n> So the cell (6,1) is vacated only when the segment that was there moves, but another segment might move in if it's the next position.\n> \n> In a straight line, cells are vacated only at the tail.\n> \n> But here, the snake is not straight; it's bent.\n> \n> For instance, if we move the head left to (2,6), then the tail (2,2) moves to (2,1), so (2,2) is freed.\n> \n> (6,1) is still occupied, now by the segment that was at (5,1), which moves to (6,1).\n> \n> Similarly, it will take many moves for the tail to reach the area near (6,1).\n> \n> The shortest path or number of moves to free (6,1): since it's 5 segments from the tail (indices from 8 to 13, difference 5, but tail is 13, so 5 segments between, so after 6 moves, the current segment at index 8 might be near tail if no growth.\n> \n> But with the current coiling, it might take more.\n> \n> Given that the food at (6,1) has only 3 turns left (can be eaten on turn 57,58,59), and it's unlikely to be freed in time, because in 3 moves, the tail won't reach (6,1). For example, after 3 moves, the tail might be at (2,1) or something, but (6,1) is still occupied. So probably, we cannot eat (6,1) in time. So we should ignore it for now.\n> \n> Similarly, it's risky to go for it.\n> \n> So focus on (2,4) and (5,4).\n> \n> Now, back to the choices.\n> \n> From (3,6), I can go L to (2,6) or D to (3,5).\n> \n> If I go L to (2,6) on turn 57, then I can go D to (2,5) on turn 58, then D to (2,4) on turn 59 to eat.\n> \n> After eating, the snake grows, so length increases, tail doesn't move.\n> \n> Now, from there, I need to think further.\n> \n> But let's see the other food.\n> \n> (5,4) is also available.\n> \n> But (2,4) is closer in terms of moves.\n> \n> I could go to (5,4) but it takes more moves.\n> \n> But I need to avoid dead ends.\n> \n> Also, there are obstacles.\n> \n> For example, from (2,4), after eating, where to go.\n> \n> But let's plan the sequence.\n> \n> First, I should go for (2,4) since it's closer and less risky.\n> \n> But let's check if moving to (2,6) is safe.\n> \n> (2,6): moving there, is it free? Yes.\n> \n> Then to (2,5): free.\n> \n> Then to (2,4): free and has food.\n> \n> Now, after eating at (2,4) on turn 59, the snake head is at (2,4), and the tail doesn't move, so the new tail is the old tail, but since we ate, the tail stays, so the segment that was tail is still there, and a new segment is added at head, so length increases by one.\n> \n> After eating, the head is at food position, and a new segment is added, so the tail remains where it was.\n> \n> In this case, on turn 59, after moving to (2,4) and eating, head at (2,4), body includes the previous positions, with a new segment added at (2,4)? No.\n> \n> When you eat, the head moves to the food cell, and a new segment is added at the position where the tail was or something? I think I have confusion.\n> \n> Standard snake: when head moves to a cell with food, it eats, so the head is at the food cell, and instead of moving the tail, we keep the tail where it is, so the snake grows by one segment.\n> \n> So positions: the head moves to new cell (food), and the body follows, but the tail doesn't move, so the new position is head at food, then the previous head position, and so on, up to the tail which stays.\n> \n> For example, before move to (2,4), at turn 58, snake positions: let's simulate.\n> \n> Turn 57: move L to (2,6)\n> \n> After move, snake: head at (2,6), then body: (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), and tail (2,2) is removed? No.\n> \n> When head moves to new cell, the tail is removed only if no food eaten.\n> \n> But when no food, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to previous position, tail is removed.\n> \n> With food, head moves to food cell, body segments move as usual, but tail is not removed, so a new segment is added at the tail position? No.\n> \n> Standard: when no food, head moves to new cell, tail cell is vacated.\n> \n> When food eaten, head moves to food cell, tail does not move, so the snake grows; the segment that was going to be removed is kept.\n> \n> So positions: after eating, the new head is at food, then the previous head position, and all previous body positions, with tail unchanged.\n> \n> For example, at turn 58, after moving to (2,6) on turn 57: positions: head (2,6), then (3,6), (4,6), ..., up to (2,1), and tail (2,2) is gone?

It's turn 58, and I'm playing Snake on a 7x7 grid since the borders are from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7, so that's 8x8 cells, but walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think. Let me confirm: walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so cells like (0,y) and (7,y) for all y, and (x,0), (x,7) for all x, so yes, the grid is from 1 to 6 in both x and y, inclusive. Also, there are internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4). So I need to avoid those too.\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (3,5), and the body segments follow: (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1). So the snake is 14 segments long? Let's count: positions from index 0 to 13, so 14 segments. Head at (3,5), tail at (2,1).\n> \n> Head direction is D, which is down, so moving down.\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (6,1) with value 1 and life span 2. So it disappears after 2 turns, including current turn? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 58, life span 2, so it will be gone by turn 60 if not eaten.\n> \n> - (5,4) with value 1, life span 4\n> \n> - (2,4) with value 1, life span 7\n> \n> - (3,6) with value 1, life span 10. But (3,6) is a body segment of the snake? Snake positions: head (3,5), then (3,6) is the first body segment. So food at (3,6) is under the snake's body.\n> \n> According to the rules, food can spawn under the body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and the head moves onto it. So for (3,6), since it's occupied by the snake body, I can't eat it now; I need to move the body away first.\n> \n> Also, tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide. But here, tail is at (2,1), and food is at (6,1), (5,4), etc., not near tail currently.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan actions for multiple turns ahead, at least 5 turns, to maximize score and prioritize survival.\n> \n> First, let's map out the grid.\n> \n> Grid size: walls at borders, so playable cells: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n> \n> Obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4)\n> \n> So let's list all blocked cells:\n> \n> - Walls: all (0,y), (7,y) for y=0 to 7; all (x,0), (x,7) for x=0 to 7. But since play area is 1-6, we can ignore outside for movement, but need to avoid moving to walls.\n> \n> - Internal obstacles: (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), (4,4), (5,2)\n> \n> (1,2), (1,4), (1,5) are all at x=1, y=2,4,5. Also (4,4) and (5,2).\n> \n> Now snake positions: from head to tail: (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1)\n> \n> So the snake is mostly on the right and bottom side, with a bend.\n> \n> Head at (3,5), moving down. Current direction is D.\n> \n> From (3,5), moving down would go to (3,4), but (3,4) is not occupied? Let's see what's at (3,4). Snake positions don't have (3,4), so it should be empty, but is there food or obstacle?\n> \n> Food at (6,1), (5,4), (2,4), (3,6).

Walls are at borders, (3,4) is within 1-6, so not wall. Obstacles: (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), (4,4), (5,2) — none at (3,4), so empty.\n> \n> But is it occupied by snake body? Snake positions: head (3,5), body (3,6), (4,6), etc., down to (2,1). (3,4) not in list, so free.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,5): x=2,y=5, within bounds. Not wall. Obstacles: (1,2),(1,4),(1,5) are at x=1, so (2,5) should be free. Snake positions: no (2,5), so free.\n> \n> (4,5): similarly, free.\n> \n> Now, I need to think ahead for multiple turns.\n> \n> Food available:\n> \n> - (6,1): value +1, life span 2. At turn 58, so after this turn, at turn 59, life span 1, then gone at turn 60. So it must be eaten by turn 59 to get it.\n> \n> - (5,4): value +1, life span 4. So disappears after 4 turns, i.e., by turn 62 if not eaten.\n> \n> - (2,4): value +1, life span 7. Disappears by turn 65.\n> \n> - (3,6): value +1, life span 10. Disappears by turn 68. But it's under the snake body at (3,6), which is the second segment.\n> \n> To eat (3,6), I need to move the body away first. Currently, (3,6) is occupied, so I can't eat it now. I need to move such that the snake moves and the segment at (3,6) leaves, then later head can come back.\n> \n> But life span is 10, so plenty of time.\n> \n> Now, also, tail is at (2,1), and head is at (3,5), not adjacent, so no immediate tail danger.\n> \n> But let's see where the tail is going. When the snake moves, the tail moves forward, so at each turn, tail moves to the next segment position when head moves.\n> \n> In snake, when head moves to a new cell, if it doesn't eat food, the tail moves forward, so the last segment is removed. If it eats food, tail doesn't move, snake grows.\n> \n> Here, all food is positive, value +1, so eating food increases length by one.\n> \n> But for negative food, length unchanged, but here all are +1.\n> \n> Now, let's consider the food at (6,1). It's at (6,1), which is actually occupied by the snake! Snake positions include (6,1), which is the 10th segment? Positions: index 0: (3,5) head, 1: (3,6), 2: (4,6), 3: (5,6), 4: (6,6), 5: (6,5), 6: (6,4), 7: (6,3), 8: (6,2), 9: (6,1), then 10: (5,1), 11: (4,1), 12: (3,1), 13: (2,1) tail.\n> \n> So (6,1) is occupied by the snake body segment at index 9.\n> \n> Food is at (6,1) with life span 2. But since the snake is on it, and it's not the head, it can't be eaten now. To eat it, the snake body must move away, then head can move to it.\n> \n> But life span is only 2, so at turn 58, it's there, but snake is on it, so if the snake moves away from (6,1) at some point, and head comes to it before life span ends.\n> \n> Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 58, life span 2, meaning it will disappear after 2 more turns? Let's clarify.\n> \n> The rule: \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So for food with life span N at turn t, it will disappear at the end of turn t + N - 1? I need to be careful.\n> \n> Assume that at turn t, food has life span L. After the turn, if not eaten, life span decreases by 1. If it reaches 0, it disappears.\n> \n> So at start of turn t, food has life span L. After the turn, if not eaten, L decreases by 1. If L=1, after decrease, it becomes 0 and disappears.\n> \n> Standard way: if life span is L at turn t, it can be eaten on turns t, t+1, ..., t+L-1, and disappears at the end of turn t+L-1.\n> \n> For example, here turn 58, food at (6,1) has life span 2, so it can be eaten on turn 58 or turn 59. If not eaten by turn 59, it disappears after turn 59.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,4) life span 4, can be eaten on turns 58,59,60,61, disappears after 61.\n> \n> (2,4) life span 7, turns 58 to 64.\n> \n> (3,6) life span 10, turns 58 to 67.\n> \n> But (3,6) is occupied by snake body, so can't be eaten until the body moves away.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,1) is occupied by snake body, so can't be eaten now.\n> \n> For (6,1), since it's under the body, and life span only 2, it might be hard to eat it in time.\n> \n> At turn 58, (6,1) has life span 2, so if not eaten on turn 58, it can be eaten on turn 59, but on turn 58 it's occupied, so unless the snake moves and the body leaves (6,1) on this turn, but when the snake moves, if head doesn't eat food, tail moves forward, so the cell that was tail is freed.\n> \n> Let's think about the snake movement.\n> \n> At turn 58, snake positions: head (3,5), body: (3,6), (4,6), ..., (6,1), (5,1), ..., (2,1) tail.\n> \n> Current direction D, so I choose action: D, L, or R.\n> \n> If I move, say, down to (3,4), then new head position (3,4). Since I didn't eat food (no food at (3,4)? Food is at (6,1), (5,4), etc., not at (3,4), so no food eaten, so tail moves forward, meaning the last segment (2,1) is removed, and new positions: head (3,4), then body from old head to second last: (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), ..., up to (5,1), (4,1), (3,1) — (2,1) is tail and removed.\n> \n> After move down to (3,4), no food, so snake shortens at tail: tail (2,1) removed, so new positions: [(3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1)] — now 14 segments, but since tail removed, it should be 13 segments? Original 14 positions, head moves to new cell, if no food, tail is removed, so new snake has same number of segments.\n> \n> Original: 14 segments. After move: head to new position, and the last segment (tail) is removed, so new snake has 13 segments? No.\n> \n> Snake has N segments. When head moves to a new cell, if no food, the tail segment is removed, so the snake has N segments again.\n> \n> If food eaten, tail not removed, so N+1 segments.\n> \n> Here, N=14 segments.\n> \n> After moving head to new cell without eating food, the new snake has the new head position, followed by the first N-1 segments of the old body, so still N segments.\n> \n> For example, old positions: [H, B1, B2, ..., B13] where B13 is tail.\n> \n> After move to new cell C, if no food, new positions: [C, H, B1, B2, ..., B12] — so B13 removed, and H is now the first body segment.\n> \n> Indices: old positions: 0: head, 1 to 13: body, 13 is tail.\n> \n> After move to new position P, new head at P, new body: old positions 0 to 12, so new positions: P, old0, old1, ..., old12.\n> \n> Number of segments same, 14.\n> \n> Tail was old13, which is removed.\n> \n> In this case, after moving down to (3,4), new head (3,4), then body: old head (3,5) at index 0, then old1: (3,6), old2: (4,6), ..., up to old12: (3,1)? Old positions: let's list indices:\n> \n> Old: 0: (3,5), 1: (3,6), 2: (4,6), 3: (5,6), 4: (6,6), 5: (6,5), 6: (6,4), 7: (6,3), 8: (6,2), 9: (6,1), 10: (5,1), 11: (4,1), 12: (3,1), 13: (2,1) tail.\n> \n> After move down to (3,4), no food, so new head (3,4), new body: old0 to old12: so (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1). Then tail is (3,1), and old13 (2,1) removed.\n> \n> So new positions: [(3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1)] — 14 segments, tail at (3,1).\n> \n> (6,1) is still occupied by the body.\n> \n> Food at (6,1) has life span 2 at turn 58. After this turn, at turn 59, life span decreases to 1, so it can be eaten on turn 59.\n> \n> But at turn 59, (6,1) might still be occupied or not.\n> \n> In the new positions after turn 58 move, (6,1) is at index 10, which is body, not head.\n> \n> To eat the food at (6,1), the head needs to move to (6,1) when it is free.\n> \n> Currently, after turn 58, if I move down, (6,1) is still occupied.\n> \n> If I move in a way that the body moves away from (6,1) sooner.\n> \n> For example, if I move in a direction that causes the tail to move faster, but the tail moves only when head doesn't eat food.\n> \n> To free (6,1), I need the snake to move so that the segment at (6,1) is no longer occupied, which means it must be the tail at some point and then moved away from.\n> \n> Since (6,1) is not the tail now, it will become tail only after several moves, when the snake moves forward without eating food.\n> \n> Currently, tail is at (2,1), and (6,1) is at position 9 in old, or after move, it's index 10 in new list, not tail.\n> \n> The distance to tail: from head to (6,1) is several segments away.\n> \n> In the snake, the segment at (6,1) will become the tail after the snake moves 4 times without eating food?

It's turn 59, and I'm the AI controlling the snake. The grid has walls: border cells where x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7 are walls, so the playable area is from x=1 to x=6 and y=1 to y=6, but there are internal obstacles too: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4). I should list all unwalkable cells.\n> \n> Border walls: all cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. Also, internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4). So, the snake cannot move to these cells.\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (4,5), then body segments: (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1). So the tail is at (3,1). Snake length is 14 segments, since there are 14 positions listed.\n> \n> Head direction is R, which is right, so currently moving east.\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (6,1) with value 1 and life span 1. Since life span decreases every turn, including current, and turn is 59, it will disappear after this turn if not eaten? Life span is given as 1, so after turn 59, it should be gone. Let me read the rule: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\", and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So for food at (6,1) with life span 1, it will be available only on turn 59 and disappear after that, meaning if not eaten on turn 59, it's gone.\n> \n> But turn 59 is the current turn, so I can eat it now if I move there.\n> \n> Similarly, other food:\n> \n> - (5,4) with value 1, life span 3.

Current direction R, so cannot move L (opposite) on next turn. But since turn 59 is the decision point, I can choose U, D, or R, but not L.\n> \n> The rule: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\" So for turn 59, since current direction is R, I cannot choose L for turn 59 action.\n> \n> Actions are for the turn I'm about to take.

But let's confirm.\n> \n> U: (4,6) is snake body, yes.\n> \n> D: (4,4) is wall.\n> \n> L: not allowed because reverse, and also occupied.\n> \n> R: (5,5) is empty.\n> \n> But is (5,5) empty? Snake has (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), etc., not (5,5). Obstacles have (5,2), not (5,5). So yes, (5,5) is free.\n> \n> Therefore, I must move right to (5,5) on turn 59. No other choice, because other moves are fatal or not possible.\n> \n> But the head direction is R, so moving R is fine.\n> \n> After moving to (5,5), the snake head is at (5,5), and direction is R.\n> \n> Now, for future turns, I need to plan.\n> \n> But let's see the food.\n> \n> Food at (6,1) with life span 1: if not eaten now, it disappears. But on turn 59, head is at (4,5), moving to (5,5), so not eating it. (6,1) is occupied by snake body? Position 10: (6,1) is a body segment, and food is at (6,1) with value 1.\n> \n> Food can spawn under snake body, but can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves onto it later.\n> \n> But here, food is at (6,1), which is currently occupied by the snake body segment at position 10: (6,1).\n> \n> Life span 1, so after this turn, it disappears if not eaten. But to eat it, I need the body to move away from (6,1) and then head to move there, but since it disappears after this turn, and I'm not moving head there now, it will be gone. So I cannot eat it; it will vanish.\n> \n> Similarly, other food.\n> \n> Now, for turn 59, I think I have to move R to (5,5).\n> \n> Then, after that, head at (5,5), direction R.\n> \n> Now, possible moves for next turn.\n> \n> First, let's simulate the snake movement.\n> \n> When I move to (5,5), the snake grows only if I eat food, but I'm not eating food now, since (5,5) has no food? Food positions: (6,1), (5,4), (2,4), (3,6). (5,5) not food, so no eating, so snake length same, tail moves away.\n> \n> After moving head to (5,5), the new positions: head at (5,5), then the body: previous head (4,5) becomes new segment 1, then (3,5) is segment 2, and so on, but since no growth, the tail (3,1) moves away? When snake moves without eating, the tail moves forward.\n> \n> Standard snake: when head moves to new cell, if no food, tail is removed, so snake shifts.\n> \n> Positions: after move to (5,5), head is (5,5), then the first body segment is the previous head position, which is (4,5), then next is (3,5), then (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), and tail (3,1) is removed since no growth.\n> \n> Tail is (3,1), which will be removed, so the new tail is (5,1)? Let's list new positions after moving head to (5,5):\n> \n> - Head: (5,5)\n> \n> - Body: (4,5)  // previous head\n> \n> - (3,5)  // previous segment 1\n> \n> - (3,6)  // previous segment 2\n> \n> - (4,6)  // previous segment 3\n> \n> - (5,6)  // previous segment 4\n> \n> - (6,6)  // previous segment 5\n> \n> - (6,5)  // previous segment 6\n> \n> - (6,4)  // previous segment 7\n> \n> - (6,3)  // previous segment 8\n> \n> - (6,2)  // previous segment 9\n> \n> - (6,1)  // previous segment 10\n> \n> - (5,1)  // previous segment 11\n> \n> - (4,1)  // previous segment 12\n> \n> Previous segment 13 was (3,1), but since no growth, it is removed, so the tail is now (4,1), and the snake has 13 segments? Original had 14 positions, after move, head new, tail removed, so 13 segments.\n> \n> Original positions: 14 cells. After move: head to new position (5,5), and tail removed, so new positions: (5,5) + positions 0 to 12 except tail is gone? Positions: index 0 to 13, 14 segments.\n> \n> After move: new head at (5,5), then segments from old index 0 to 12, but old index 0 was head, now becomes body, so new body: old positions 0,1,2,...,12? Better to think: the new body includes the previous head position and all body positions except the tail is removed.\n> \n> So new positions: head: (5,5)\n> \n> Then: previous positions: index 0: (4,5) now body\n> \n> Index 1: (3,5) body\n> \n> Index 2: (3,6) body\n> \n> Index 3: (4,6) body\n> \n> Index 4: (5,6) body\n> \n> Index 5: (6,6) body\n> \n> Index 6: (6,5) body\n> \n> Index 7: (6,4) body\n> \n> Index 8: (6,3) body\n> \n> Index 9: (6,2) body\n> \n> Index 10: (6,1) body\n> \n> Index 11: (5,1) body\n> \n> Index 12: (4,1) body\n> \n> Index 13: (3,1) was tail, removed.\n> \n> So new tail is (4,1), and snake length 13.\n> \n> Now, food at (6,1): it was under the body, but since the body moved away? After move, (6,1) is still occupied? New positions: (6,1) is index 10, still part of body? Let's see: after move, the cell (6,1) has a body segment at index 10, but the food is there. Since the body is still on (6,1), but food can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves on.\n> \n> Currently, body is on (6,1), so food is not accessible until body leaves.\n> \n> But life span 1, so after turn 59, it disappears, since not eaten on turn 59.\n> \n> Similarly, other food.\n> \n> Now for turn 60: head at (5,5), direction R (since I moved right).\n> \n> Possible moves: U (5,6), D (5,4), L (4,5), R (6,5)\n> \n> Now, check each:\n> \n> - U (5,6): what is there?

Obstacles: (5,2) is obstacle, but (5,4) not mentioned, so should be free? But let's see obstacles: internal (4,4), (5,2), etc., no (5,4), so (5,4) is free?

However:\n\n1. **No Instant Reverse**: Current direction is R, so cannot move L (opposite).\n2. **Collision Check**:\n   - **U (5,6)**: Occupied by body segment (5,6) → Collision\n   - **D (5,4)**: Not occupied by snake, not a wall or obstacle → Safe\n   - **R (6,5)**: Occupied by body segment (6,5) → Collision\n   - **L**: Invalid (opposite direction)\n\n**Conclusion**: Only possible move is **D (Down)** to (5,4).\n\n### Executing Move D at Turn 60\n\n- **New Head Position**: (5,4)\n- **Action**: Eat food at (5,4) → Snake length increases to 15\n- **New Direction**: D (Down)\n- **Updated Snake Positions**: Head at (5,4), followed by (5,5), (4,5), ..., tail at (4,1)\n- **Food Update**: (5,4) is eaten and removed; other foods' life spans decrease by 1:\n  - (2,4): Life Span 4\n  - (3,6): Life Span 7\n\n### Next Moves Based on Guidance\n\nThe provided guidance suggests a sequence of moves from Turn 60 to Turn 65. Let's verify the next moves:\n\n**Turn 61**:\n- **Head at (5,4), Direction D**\n- Possible moves:\n  - U (5,5): Body segment → Collision\n  - D (5,3): Free (not wall, obstacle, or body)\n  - L (4,4): Obstacle → Invalid\n  - R (6,4): Body segment → Collision\n- **Only possible move**: D to (5,3)\n\n**Turn 62**:\n- **Head at (5,3), Direction D**\n- Possible moves:\n  - U (5,4): Body segment → Collision\n  - D (5,2): Obstacle → Invalid\n  - L (4,3): Free\n  - R (6,3): Body segment → Collision\n- **Only possible move**: L to (4,3)\n\n**Turn 63**:\n- **Head at (4,3), Direction L**\n- Possible moves:\n  - U (4,4): Obstacle → Invalid\n  - D (4,2): Free\n  - L (3,3): Free\n  - R (5,3): Body segment → Collision\n- **Possible moves**: D or L\n- **Guidance chooses L to (3,3)** to move towards the left side and potentially free (3,6) later.\n\n**Turn 64**:\n- **Head at (3,3), Direction L**\n- Possible moves:\n  - U (3,4): Free\n  - D (3,2): Free\n  - L (2,3): Free\n  - R (4,3): Body segment → Collision\n- **Guidance chooses U to (3,4)** to position closer to (2,4) or (3,6)\n\n**Turn 65**:\n- **Head at (3,4), Direction U**\n- Possible moves:\n  - U (3,5): Body segment → Collision\n  - D (3,3): Body segment → Collision\n  - L (2,4): Free (food may be gone by then)\n  - R (4,4): Obstacle → Invalid\n- **Only possible move**: L to (2,4) (even if food is gone, it's safe)\n\n### Verifying the Sequence\n\nThe sequence ensures the snake avoids immediate collisions and positions itself to potentially access other food items later, especially (3,6), while acknowledging that (2,4) may not be reachable in time due to its short remaining lifespan.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the analysis and the guidance provided, the immediate action for Turn 60 is:\n\n\\boxed{D}",

It's turn 60, and the grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So coordinates range from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are at the borders, meaning cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls and can't be moved to.\n> \n> Internal obstacles are given: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4). So these cells are blocked and can't be moved to.\n> \n> Snake positions: Head is at (5,5), and the body segments are: (4,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1). That's 14 segments. Let me list them in order:\n> \n> 1. Head: (5,5)\n> \n> 2. (4,5)\n> \n> 3. (3,5)\n> \n> 4. (3,6)\n> \n> 5. (4,6)\n> \n> 6. (5,6)\n> \n> 7. (6,6)\n> \n> 8. (6,5)\n> \n> 9.

No negative food here.\n> \n> Life span: for (5,4), it disappears after 3 turns, including current turn? Life span decreases every turn, including the current one. So at turn 60, life span is 3, meaning it will disappear after turn 62? Let's clarify.\n> \n> Life span N: disappears after N turns. Countdown decreases every turn, including current. So if at turn t, life span is N, then:\n> \n> - After turn t, life span becomes N-1\n> \n> - After turn t+1, it becomes N-2, and so on.\n> \n> - It disappears when life span reaches 0, so it exists for N turns starting from t.\n> \n> At turn t with life span N, it will be present for turns t, t+1, ..., t+N-1, and disappears at the start of turn t+N or something? I need to be precise.\n> \n> Typically in such games, if life span is N at turn t, it means:\n> \n> - At the beginning of turn t, it is present with life span N.\n> \n> - After the snake moves on turn t, if it eats the food, it's consumed; otherwise, life span decreases to N-1 for turn t+1.\n> \n> - If life span reaches 0, it disappears before the next turn.\n> \n> But in the context, it says \"life-span disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> Assume that at the start of turn t, for a food with life span L, it will be there during turn t. After the turn, if not eaten, L decreases by 1. If L was 1, it disappears after turn t.\n> \n> So for (5,4): life span 3 at turn 60. So:\n> \n> - Turn 60: present, life span 3\n> \n> - After turn 60, if not eaten, life span becomes 2 for turn 61\n> \n> - Turn 61: present, life span 2\n> \n> - After turn 61, if not eaten, life span becomes 1 for turn 62\n> \n> - Turn 62: present, life span 1\n> \n> - After turn 62, if not eaten, disappears before turn 63.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,4): life span 5 at turn 60, so lasts until turn 64 (since after turn 64, life span 0, gone).\n> \n> Turn 60: L=5\n> \n> After turn 60: if not eaten, L=4 for turn 61\n> \n> Turn 61: L=4\n> \n> After turn 61: L=3 for turn 62\n> \n> ...\n> \n> After turn 64: L=0, disappears before turn 65.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,6): life span 8 at turn 60, lasts until turn 67.\n> \n> Now, look at food positions:\n> \n> - (5,4): this is directly below the head.

To eat it, the body must move away, meaning the snake must move so that the segment at (3,6) is no longer there, and then the head can move to (3,6) to eat it.\n> \n> But the head is at (5,5), so it would take multiple moves to get to (3,6).\n> \n> Also, life span is 8, so it has time.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,4) is below head, life span only 3, so it will disappear soon.\n> \n> (2,4) is at (2,4), life span 5.\n> \n> Now, current head position: (5,5), direction R (right).\n> \n> Possible moves: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), L (left, x-1), R (right, x+1).\n> \n> But cannot move opposite to current direction.

Life span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 61, life_span=4, so it will disappear after turn 64? Let's see: on turn 61, life_span=4; after turn 61, it becomes 3; after turn 62, 2; after turn 63, 1; after turn 64, 0 and disappears.

Then the body segments: segment 1 (5,5) moves to (5,4), segment 2 (4,5) moves to (5,5)? No.\n> \n> When snake moves, head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment. So:\n> \n> - New head: (5,3)\n> \n> - Then segment 1 (old head position) becomes new segment 1: (5,4)\n> \n> - Segment 2: moves to where segment 1 was, which is (5,5)\n> \n> - Segment 3: moves to where segment 2 was, (4,5)\n> \n> - And so on, down to tail.\n> \n> Since no food eaten, tail remains, so the last segment, tail at (4,1), is removed? When no food, the snake moves forward, so the tail end is vacated.\n> \n> Specifically: if no food eaten, head moves to new cell, each body segment shifts to the previous position, and the tail cell is vacated.\n> \n> If food eaten, head moves to food, body segments shift, but tail doesn't move, so snake grows by one.\n> \n> In this case, moving to (5,3), which is not food, so no growth. New positions: head (5,3), then body: (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), and tail was (4,1), but since no growth, tail moves to where segment 13 was, which is (5,1)? Let's trace.\n> \n> After move down:\n> \n> - Head new: (5,3)\n> \n> - Segment 1: old head (5,4) -> new segment 1\n> \n> - Segment 2: old segment 1 (5,5) -> new segment 2\n> \n> - Segment 3: old segment 2 (4,5) -> new segment 3\n> \n> - Segment 4: old segment 3 (3,5) -> new segment 4\n> \n> - Segment 5: old segment 4 (3,6) -> new segment 5\n> \n> - Segment 6: old segment 5 (4,6) -> new segment 6\n> \n> - Segment 7: old segment 6 (5,6) -> new segment 7\n> \n> - Segment 8: old segment 7 (6,6) -> new segment 8\n> \n> - Segment 9: old segment 8 (6,5) -> new segment 9\n> \n> - Segment 10: old segment 9 (6,4) -> new segment 10\n> \n> - Segment 11: old segment 10 (6,3) -> new segment 11\n> \n> - Segment 12: old segment 11 (6,2) -> new segment 12\n> \n> - Segment 13: old segment 12 (6,1) -> new segment 13\n> \n> - Segment 14: old segment 13 (5,1) -> new segment 14 (tail)\n> \n> Old segment 14 (4,1) is not part of snake anymore; it's vacated.\n> \n> Now, (5,3) was empty, so no collision.\n> \n> But is (5,3) a wall? No, borders are x=0,7 y=0,7, so (5,3) is x=5,y=3, both between 1 and 6? x from 0 to 7, walls at x=0 and x=7, y=0 and y=7, so cells with x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6 are inside, but y=0 and y=7 are borders.\n> \n> y=0 and y=7 are walls, so for y, valid from 1 to 6? Let's see: y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y from 1 to 6 are free, except obstacles.\n> \n> Similarly x from 1 to 6.\n> \n> In snake positions, we have (6,1), (5,1), (4,1) which are y=1, not wall, since y=0 is wall, so y=1 is playable.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,6) is y=6, not wall.\n> \n> So (5,3) is x=5,y=3, which is within bounds, not border, not obstacle, not occupied by snake body in new position, so safe.\n> \n> Now, moving Left (L): to (4,4). (4,4) is an internal obstacle! Obstacles include (4,4). So cannot move there, wall.\n> \n> Moving Right (R): to (6,4). (6,4) is currently occupied by snake segment 9? Current positions: (6,4) is segment 10? List: index 0: (5,4) head, 1: (5,5), 2: (4,5), 3: (3,5), 4: (3,6), 5: (4,6), 6: (5,6), 7: (6,6), 8: (6,5), 9: (6,4), 10: (6,3), etc.\n> \n> So (6,4) is segment 9? Index 9: (6,4).\n> \n> If I move right to (6,4), that is currently occupied by segment 9. After move, if no food, the snake moves, so head moves to (6,4), which is where segment 9 is now. But when head moves there, segment 9 will move to where segment 8 was or something? Let's see new positions.\n> \n> If move right to (6,4):\n> \n> - New head: (6,4)\n> \n> - Segment 1: old head (5,4) -> new segment 1\n> \n> - Segment 2: old segment 1 (5,5) -> new segment 2\n> \n> - ...\n> - Segment 9: old segment 8 (6,5) -> new segment 9\n> \n> - Segment 10: old segment 9 (6,4) -> but head is moving to (6,4), which is the same as old segment 9 position.\n> \n> After head moves to (6,4), which was occupied by segment 9, but segment 9 will move to the position of old segment 8, which is (6,5) since old segment 8 is (6,5).\n> \n> Old positions: segment 9 is at (6,4), segment 8 at (6,5), etc.\n> \n> New positions:\n> \n> - Head: (6,4)  // new position\n> \n> - Segment 1: old head (5,4)\n> \n> - Segment 2: old segment 1 (5,5)\n> \n> - Segment 3: old segment 2 (4,5)\n> \n> - ...\n> - Segment 9: old segment 8 (6,5)  // moves to where segment 8 was\n> \n> - Segment 10: old segment 9 (6,4) -> but (6,4) is now the head, so segment 10 moves to where segment 9 was, which is (6,4), but that cell is now occupied by head? Conflict.\n> \n> In terms of collision: when the head moves to a cell, if that cell is occupied by any body segment except the tail (and tail is moving), it collides.\n> \n> Here, (6,4) is currently occupied by segment 9, which is not the tail (tail is segment 14 at (4,1)). So moving to (6,4) would cause head to collide with body segment at (6,4), so death.\n> \n> Therefore, cannot move right to (6,4).\n> \n> Similarly, moving Up: but current direction is Down, and no instant reverse, so cannot move Up to (5,5), because that's opposite direction.\n> \n> Up is (x,y+1), so from (5,4) to (5,5). But (5,5) is currently segment 1, so occupied, and moving there would collide.\n> \n> Also, since current direction is Down, moving Up is reverse, not allowed.\n> \n> So possible moves from (5,4) with direction Down:\n> \n> - Down (D) to (5,3): safe, as above.\n> \n> - Left (L) to (4,4): but (4,4) is an obstacle, wall, cannot.\n> \n> - Right (R) to (6,4): but (6,4) is occupied by segment 9, not tail, so collision, cannot.\n> \n> - Up not allowed.\n> \n> So only possible move is Down to (5,3).\n> \n> Is that right? Left to (4,4) is obstacle, right to (6,4) is body, down to (5,3) is free.\n> \n> But (5,3) is not food, so no issue.\n> \n> But I have to choose an action for turn 61.\n> \n> According to this, only Down is possible? That can't be, let me double-check.\n> \n> Current head (5,4), direction Down.\n> \n> Move Down: (5,3) - not wall, not obstacle, not snake body (current body positions don't include (5,3), and after move, as above, no collision.\n> \n> Move Left: (4,4) - obstacle, wall, cannot.\n> \n> Move Right: (6,4) - currently occupied by segment 9, which is body, not tail. When head moves there, it would be on the same cell as segment 9 before it moves, so collision.\n> \n> Move Up: not allowed because reverse direction.\n> \n> So indeed, only Down is possible at turn 61.\n> \n> But that seems odd, but based on the state, it is.\n> \n> Perhaps I missed something.\n> \n> Food at (2,4), (3,6), (6,5).\n> \n> (6,5) is food, but at (6,5), which is currently occupied by segment 8? Segment 8 is (6,5), so it's under the body.\n> \n> But to eat it, the body must move away, and head move onto it.\n> \n> Currently, head is at (5,4), not adjacent to (6,5).\n> \n> Adjacent cells to head (5,4): (5,3) down, (5,5) up, (4,4) left, (6,4) right.\n> \n> (6,5) is not adjacent; it's diagonal or something? (6,5) is x=6,y=5, head is (5,4), so not adjacent; adjacent are same x or y, differ by 1.\n> \n> So (6,5) is not adjacent to (5,4); it's (6,4) right and (5,5) up, but not directly adjacent.\n> \n> So for now, at turn 61, only move down to (5,3) is possible.\n> \n> Then, after that, snake head at (5,3), and direction is now Down, since I moved down.\n> \n> Then I need to plan subsequent turns.\n> \n> But I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> First, for turn 61, I must move Down to (5,3).\n> \n> Then turn 62: head at (5,3), direction Down.\n> \n> Now possible moves: Down to (5,2), but (5,2) is an internal obstacle! Obstacles include (5,2), so cannot move there.\n> \n> Left to (4,3): is (4,3) free? Not wall, not obstacle listed, not snake? After turn 61 move, snake positions: as I had earlier, head (5,3), segments: (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), and tail at (5,1)? Earlier I had new segment 14 at (5,1), but let's list new positions after turn 61 down move:\n> \n> - Head: (5,3)\n> \n> - Seg1: (5,4)  // old head\n> \n> - Seg2: (5,5)  // old seg1\n> \n> - Seg3: (4,5)  // old seg2\n> \n> - Seg4: (3,5)  // old seg3\n> \n> - Seg5: (3,6)  // old seg4\n> \n> - Seg6: (4,6)  // old seg5\n> \n> - Seg7: (5,6)  // old seg6\n> \n> - Seg8: (6,6)  // old seg7\n> \n> - Seg9: (6,5)  // old seg8\n> \n> - Seg10: (6,4)  // old seg9\n> \n> - Seg11: (6,3)  // old seg10\n> \n> - Seg12: (6,2)  // old seg11\n> \n> - Seg13: (6,1)  // old seg12\n> \n> - Seg14: (5,1)  // old seg13, new tail\n> \n> Old seg14 (4,1) vacated.\n> \n> So positions: (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1)\n> \n> Now turn 62, head at (5,3), direction Down.\n> \n> Possible moves:\n> \n> Down to (5,2): but (5,2) is internal obstacle, cannot.\n> \n> Up to (5,4): but (5,4) is currently seg1, occupied.

Not in snake positions, so should be safe.\n> \n> Right to (6,3): (6,3) is currently seg11? Positions: (6,3) is seg11, occupied. But is it tail? Tail is at (5,1), so (6,3) is body, not tail. Moving to (6,3) would collide with seg11.\n> \n> So possible moves: Left to (4,3) or...

Internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4). (4,3) not listed, so should be free.\n> \n> - R to (6,3): (6,3) is occupied by snake body. (6,3) is the 12th segment or so, let's see: positions: index 0: (5,3) head, 1: (5,4), 2: (5,5), 3: (4,5), 4: (3,5), 5: (3,6), 6: (4,6), 7: (5,6), 8: (6,6), 9: (6,5), 10: (6,4), 11: (6,3), 12: (6,2), 13: (6,1), 14: (5,1) tail.\n> \n> So (6,3) is position 11, a body segment, not tail. Tail is (5,1). So moving to (6,3) would be collision, invalid.\n> \n> Therefore, from (5,3), only possible move is L to (4,3), since U, D, R are all invalid.\n> \n> U to (5,4) body, D to (5,2) wall, R to (6,3) body, only L to (4,3) is free.\n> \n> But is (4,3) free? Let's confirm.\n> \n> Cells occupied: snake and walls.\n> \n> Walls: borders and internal (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4)\n> \n> (4,3): not a border, not in internal obstacles list, not in snake positions, so yes, free.\n> \n> So for turn 62, I must move L to (4,3). No other choice.\n> \n> But the problem is to think 5+ turns ahead and provide a sequence.\n> \n> First, action for turn 62: move L to (4,3).\n> \n> Now, after that, snake head is at (4,3), and since I moved left, direction is now L.\n> \n> Snake positions update: after moving to (4,3), the head is now (4,3), and the body follows. Since I didn't eat food (no food at (4,3)), the tail moves away. Tail was at (5,1), so it moves to the next position? When snake moves, if no food eaten, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, and tail segment is removed.\n> \n> So new positions: head to (4,3), then segment 1 (was (5,4)) moves to where head was, (5,3)? Let's think.\n> \n> Previous positions: head (5,3), then segments: (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), etc.\n> \n> After move L to (4,3): new head is (4,3).\n> \n> Then body: the segment that was at (5,4) moves to the previous head position (5,3).\n> \n> The segment that was at (5,5) moves to (5,4).\n> \n> The segment that was at (4,5) moves to (5,5)? No.\n> \n> The snake body segments shift: the new position for each body segment is the previous position of the segment before it.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, the neck (first body segment) moves to where head was, the next moves to where neck was, and so on, tail moves away.\n> \n> So positions: before move: index 0: (5,3) head, 1: (5,4), 2: (5,5), 3: (4,5), 4: (3,5), 5: (3,6), 6: (4,6), 7: (5,6), 8: (6,6), 9: (6,5), 10: (6,4), 11: (6,3), 12: (6,2), 13: (6,1), 14: (5,1) tail.\n> \n> After moving head to (4,3) (since moved L):\n> \n> New head: (4,3)\n> \n> Then new segment 1: previous position of segment 0, which was (5,3)\n> \n> New segment 2: previous position of segment 1, which was (5,4)\n> \n> New segment 3: previous position of segment 2, which was (5,5)\n> \n> New segment 4: previous position of segment 3, which was (4,5)\n> \n> New segment 5: previous position of segment 4, which was (3,5)\n> \n> New segment 6: previous position of segment 5, which was (3,6)\n> \n> New segment 7: previous position of segment 6, which was (4,6)\n> \n> New segment 8: previous position of segment 7, which was (5,6)\n> \n> New segment 9: previous position of segment 8, which was (6,6)\n> \n> New segment 10: previous position of segment 9, which was (6,5)\n> \n> New segment 11: previous position of segment 10, which was (6,4)\n> \n> New segment 12: previous position of segment 11, which was (6,3)\n> \n> New segment 13: previous position of segment 12, which was (6,2)\n> \n> Now, segment 13 was previously segment 12, which was (6,2), but segment 14 was tail at (5,1), which is not moved to; instead, since no food eaten, tail is removed, so we have one less segment? No.\n> \n> The snake has 15 segments. After moving without eating, the head moves to new position, and the tail position is vacated, so the new snake has the same segments except the tail is gone, and the new head position.\n> \n> New positions: head: (4,3)\n> \n> Then the body: the first body segment is now at the old head position (5,3)\n> \n> Second body segment at old first body position (5,4)\n> \n> Third at old second (5,5)\n> \n> Fourth at old third (4,5)\n> \n> Fifth at old fourth (3,5)\n> \n> Sixth at old fifth (3,6)\n> \n> Seventh at old sixth (4,6)\n> \n> Eighth at old seventh (5,6)\n> \n> Ninth at old eighth (6,6)\n> \n> Tenth at old ninth (6,5)\n> \n> Eleventh at old tenth (6,4)\n> \n> Twelfth at old eleventh (6,3)\n> \n> Thirteenth at old twelfth (6,2)\n> \n> And the old tail (5,1) is gone, so no fourteenth segment.

(4,4) is in the list: internal obstacles include (4,4), so wall, cannot move there.\n> \n> - D to (4,2): (4,2) - is this free? Not a border, not in internal obstacles? Internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4). (4,2) not listed, not snake? Snake positions: (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2). So (4,2) not occupied, should be free.\n> \n> - L to (3,3): (3,3) - not border, not internal obstacle? Internal: (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), (4,4), (5,2). (3,3) not listed, not snake?

Specifically, after move, positions: head (4,3), then (5,3) is the neck. So moving R to (5,3) would be collision, since it's not the tail.\n> \n> Tail is at (6,2), so (5,3) is body, cannot move there.\n> \n> Therefore, possible moves: U to (4,4) wall, invalid; D to (4,2) free? Let's confirm.\n> \n> (4,2): not wall, not snake. But is there a wall? Internal obstacles have (5,2), which is different from (4,2). (4,2) should be free.\n> \n> Similarly, L to (3,3) free.\n> \n> R to (5,3) body, invalid.\n> \n> And D to (4,2) seems free.\n> \n> But let's make sure about borders: y=0 is wall, but (4,2) y=2, not 0, so ok.\n> \n> So from (4,3), I can move D to (4,2) or L to (3,3).\n> \n> Now, I need to think about food and long-term.\n> \n> Food locations:\n> \n> - (2,4) at turn 63, life span 2, so can be eaten turn 63 or 64.\n> \n> - (3,6) life span 5\n> \n> - (6,5) life span 8\n> \n> Also, (3,6) is currently occupied by the snake? In food positions, (3,6) is listed, but in snake positions, after turn 62 move, we have segment at (3,6)? After turn 62, snake positions include (3,6) as the sixth segment? Let's see: after move to (4,3), positions: head (4,3), then (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), etc. So (3,6) is occupied by snake body.\n> \n> But food at (3,6): the rule says food can spawn under body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves there.\n> \n> Currently, at turn 63, (3,6) has food, but it's under a body segment. To eat it, the snake body must move away from (3,6), and then head moves to it.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,5) has food, but in current snake positions, (6,5) is occupied? After turn 62, positions include (6,5) as tenth segment? List: head (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2).

It's under the body at (3,6), which is a segment. To eat it, the body must move away.\n> \n> Currently, the snake has a segment at (3,6). When the snake moves, that segment will move to a new position.\n> \n> For example, at turn 63, if I move, the segment at (3,6) will move to where the previous segment was.\n> \n> In current positions, the segment at (3,6) will move to the position of (3,5) or something?

No.\n> \n> Old seg6 was at (3,6). After the move, new seg7 (which is the segment that was old seg6) moves to the position that old seg6 was occupying, but since the snake moves, it shifts.\n> \n> Perhaps it's better to think that the cell (3,6) is now vacated because the segment that was there moved to (3,5) or something.\n> \n> From above: new seg6 is at (3,5) which was old seg5 position.\n> \n> New seg7 is at (3,6) which was old seg6 position. But since the body segments shift, the segment that was at (3,6) is now at new seg7 position, which is (3,6), so it didn't move? That can't be right.\n> \n> I think I have a mistake.\n> \n> Initial positions at turn 63 start: let's list indices:\n> \n> Segment 0: (4,3) head\n> \n> Seg1: (5,3)\n> \n> Seg2: (5,4)\n> \n> Seg3: (5,5)\n> \n> Seg4: (4,5)\n> \n> Seg5: (3,5)\n> \n> Seg6: (3,6)\n> \n> Seg7: (4,6)\n> \n> Seg8: (5,6)\n> \n> Seg9: (6,6)\n> \n> Seg10: (6,5)\n> \n> Seg11: (6,4)\n> \n> Seg12: (6,3)\n> \n> Seg13: (6,2)  // tail\n> \n> Now, if head moves to (4,2), new head: (4,2)\n> \n> Then new seg1: position of old seg0, which is (4,3)\n> \n> New seg2: position of old seg1, (5,3)\n> \n> New seg3: position of old seg2, (5,4)\n> \n> New seg4: position of old seg3, (5,5)\n> \n> New seg5: position of old seg4, (4,5)\n> \n> New seg6: position of old seg5, (3,5)\n> \n> New seg7: position of old seg6, (3,6)\n> \n> New seg8: position of old seg7, (4,6)\n> \n> New seg9: position of old seg8, (5,6)\n> \n> New seg10: position of old seg9, (6,6)\n> \n> New seg11: position of old seg10, (6,5)\n> \n> New seg12: position of old seg11, (6,4)\n> \n> New seg13: position of old seg12, (6,3)\n> \n> And old tail (6,2) is vacated.\n> \n> So the cell (3,6) is now occupied by new seg7, which is the same segment that was there before, so it's still occupied.

(1,4) and (1,5) are obstacles, and (1,2).\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (4,3), moving left. So from (4,3), the body goes to (5,3), then to (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1).

Head is at (4,3), so (2,4) is two steps left and one up? From (4,3) to (3,3) is left, then to (2,3) is left, then up to (2,4)? But it's (2,4), which is directly accessible if the head moves left then up or something.\n> \n> - (3,6): this is currently occupied by the snake's body! Position 6 is (3,6), which is a body segment. But according to the rules, food can spawn under the body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves onto it. Here, (3,6) has food, but it's also a snake segment. So the food is under the snake at (3,6).\n> \n> The food is at (3,6), and the snake has a segment there at index 6. So since the body is there, the food can't be eaten until the snake moves away from that cell.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,5) has food, and looking at snake positions, index 10 is (6,5), which is also a body segment. So food at (6,5) is under the body too.\n> \n> Index 10: (6,5) is a body segment, and food is at (6,5), so it's under the body.\n> \n> Food at (2,4) is not under the snake, I think. Head is (4,3), body: (5,3), (5,4), etc. (2,4) is free, I believe.\n> \n> List all occupied cells by snake: (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1)\n> \n> So (2,4) is not in this list, so it's free.\n> \n> (3,6) is in the list, so food is under body.\n> \n> (6,5) is in the list, so also under body.\n> \n> Now, life spans: food at (2,4) has life span 2, meaning it will disappear after 2 turns, including the current turn? Countdown decreases every turn, including current.\n> \n> Current turn is t=63, so for (2,4), life span 2: after this turn (63), it will have 1 turn left, then after turn 64, it disappears. So it can be eaten on turn 63 or 64.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,6) life span 5: after turn 63, 4 left; after 64, 3; etc. Can be eaten until turn 67.\n> \n> (6,5) life span 8: after turn 63, 7 left; etc.\n> \n> But since (3,6) and (6,5) are under the snake body, they can only be eaten if the snake moves away and head moves on later.\n> \n> Now, snake head is at (4,3), direction left. So possible moves: since moving left, it cannot reverse to right instantly? Reverse rule: cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\n> \n> Current direction is L (left), so cannot move R (right) on this turn. Possible moves: U (up), D (down), L (left). Since direction is left, moving left is fine, up and down are perpendicular, so ok. But not right.\n> \n> Now, let's see what cells are around head (4,3):\n> \n> - Up: (4,4) – but is this free? (4,4) is an internal obstacle! Walls include (4,4) as internal obstacle. So (4,4) is wall, cannot move there.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4). So (4,4) is obstacle, so cannot move up to (4,4).\n> \n> - Down: (4,2) – is this free? Let's see, y=2, x=4. Not in snake positions? Snake positions: (4,3) head, (5,3), (5,4), etc. (4,2) not listed, and not an obstacle? Obstacles: (5,2) is obstacle, but (4,2) is not listed. Walls: borders and internal, but internal are specific points, not whole rows/columns. Border walls: x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls, so cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Internal obstacles are additional cells.\n> \n> So (4,2): x=4, y=2, not border, and not in internal obstacles list: internal are (5,2), (4,4), etc. (5,2) is obstacle, but (4,2) is not mentioned, so it should be free.\n> \n> Similarly, left: (3,3) – x=3,y=3, not border, not obstacle? Obstacles: (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), (5,2), (4,4). (3,3) not listed, so free.\n> \n> Right: (5,3) – but this is the next body segment! (5,3) is the first body segment after head, so moving right would cause collision, since it's a body part. Snake positions: head at (4,3), then (5,3) is adjacent and part of body. If head moves to (5,3), it will collide with the body segment there, unless that segment moves away, but at the same turn, when head moves, the body will move after, so if head moves to a cell that is currently occupied by body, it might collide.\n> \n> Collision rules: body collision if head touches any body segment except the tail, but note that moving into the tail is allowed because the tail will move.\n> \n> From rules: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> But for other body segments, if head moves to a cell that is occupied by a non-tail segment, it collides.\n> \n> Here, possible moves from (4,3):\n> \n> - Up: (4,4) – but (4,4) is internal obstacle, so wall, cannot move there.\n> \n> - Down: (4,2) – let's see if free. Not in snake positions: snake has (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), ..., (6,1). (4,2) not listed. Not a wall: not border, not internal obstacle (internal: (5,2) is obstacle, but (4,2) is different cell). So (4,2) should be free and safe to move to? But is it occupied by something else? Food? Food is at (2,4), (3,6), (6,5), not (4,2). So (4,2) is empty.\n> \n> - Left: (3,3) – similarly, not snake, not wall, not obstacle, not food, so free.\n> \n> - Right: (5,3) – this is occupied by the first body segment. Since it's not the tail, moving there would cause collision. Tail is at (6,1), so (5,3) is body, not tail, so cannot move right.\n> \n> Also, cannot move right because it's opposite to current direction? Current direction is left, so moving right is opposite, so not allowed anyway due to no instant reverse.\n> \n> So possible moves: Down to (4,2) or Left to (3,3).\n> \n> Now, I need to think ahead for multiple turns.\n> \n> First, let's consider the food.\n> \n> Food at (2,4) has short life span, only 2 turns including current, so it must be eaten by turn 64.\n> \n> To eat (2,4), which is at (2,4), head is at (4,3). So from (4,3), to reach (2,4), one way is left to (3,3), then up to (3,4), then left to (2,4)? (3,4) to (2,4) is left, but (2,4) is at x=2,y=4.\n> \n> From (4,3):\n> \n> - If move left to (3,3), then from there, can go up to (3,4), then left to (2,4).\n> \n> (3,4) to (2,4) is left.\n> \n> But is (3,4) free? Snake positions: we have (3,5), (3,6), but not (3,4). Obstacles: no, so (3,4) should be free.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,4) is free, except for the food.\n> \n> But life span: current turn 63, after this turn, if not eaten, life span decreases to 1, then after turn 64, it disappears. So it can be eaten on turn 63 or 64.\n> \n> If we move directly, from (4,3), we can't reach (2,4) in one move; it's not adjacent. Adjacent cells are (4,4) up (wall), (4,2) down, (3,3) left, (5,3) right (body, not possible).\n> \n> (2,4) is at (2,4), which is not adjacent to (4,3); distance is |4-2| + |3-4| = 2 + 1 = 3, so at least two moves away, but since not diagonal, min two moves if we go via (3,3) and (3,4) or something.\n> \n> From (4,3) to (2,4): possible paths: left to (3,3), then up to (3,4), then left to (2,4). That's three moves? From (4,3) to (3,3) is one move, then to (3,4) is second move, then to (2,4) is third move. But (3,3) to (3,4) is up, which is fine.\n> \n> But (2,4) is at (2,4), and we need to be there on turn 63 or 64.\n> \n> Turn 63: if we move to (3,3) now, that's turn 63 action.\n> \n> Then turn 64: from (3,3), we can move to (3,4) or directly to (2,3) or something.\n> \n> (3,3) to (2,4) is not adjacent; (2,4) is up-left from (3,3), not directly adjacent. Adjacent cells to (3,3): (3,4) up, (3,2) down, (2,3) left, (4,3) right.\n> \n> (2,4) is not adjacent to (3,3); it's diagonal. So to reach (2,4) from (3,3), we need to go to (3,4) first, then to (2,4), or to (2,3) then to (2,4), but (2,3) to (2,4) is up.\n> \n> But (2,3) might be free or not.\n> \n> Anyway, from (3,3), the quickest to (2,4) is via (3,4) or (2,3).\n> \n> But (3,4) is free, as per earlier.\n> \n> So from head at (4,3) on turn 63:\n> \n> Option: move left to (3,3) on turn 63.\n> \n> Then on turn 64, move up to (3,4).\n> \n> Then on turn 65, move left to (2,4).\n> \n> But (2,4) food disappears after turn 64? Life span: at turn 63, life span 2, so after turn 63, it has 1 turn left, meaning it exists on turn 64, and after turn 64, it disappears. So it can be eaten on turn 64, but not on turn 65.\n> \n> If we eat on turn 65, it's too late.\n> \n> Turn 64 is the last chance to eat (2,4).\n> \n> But to eat on turn 64, we need to be at (2,4) on turn 64.\n> \n> Where is head on turn 63 after move? If we move to (3,3) on turn 63, then on turn 64, head is at (3,3). From (3,3), we can move to (3,4) or (2,3) or (4,3) or (3,2), but not directly to (2,4). So on turn 64, we cannot reach (2,4) from (3,3) in one move; it's not adjacent. So impossible to eat (2,4) on turn 64 if we are at (3,3) at start of turn 64.\n> \n> Similarly, if on turn 63 we move down to (4,2), then on turn 64, head at (4,2), which is farther from (2,4), |4-2| + |2-4| = 2+2=4, at least two moves away, so cannot reach on turn 64.\n> \n> Therefore, it's impossible to eat the food at (2,4) because it requires being at (2,4) on turn 63 or 64, but from current position (4,3), we can't reach it in one move, and after one move, we are still not adjacent in a way to reach it next move.\n> \n> On turn 63, if we could be at (2,4), but we are at (4,3), not adjacent, so cannot.\n> \n> On turn 64, we need to be at (2,4), but to be there on turn 64, we need to move there on turn 64 from a position on turn 63 end.\n> \n> After turn 63 action, head position is the new head.\n> \n> At start of turn 63, head at (4,3).

Or to turn t + N?\n> \n> \"Disappears after N turns\" – after N turns from now, meaning after N full turns.\n> \n> For example, at turn 63, life span 2: it is present on turn 63, and after turn 63 (i.e., after the turn is processed), countdown to 1, then on turn 64, it is present, and after turn 64, it disappears. So it can be eaten on turn 63 or 64.\n> \n> Similarly, for life span 5 at turn 63: it can be eaten on turns 63, 64, 65, 66, 67? After turn 63, countdown 4; after turn 64, countdown 3; ... after turn 67, countdown 0, disappears. So present on turns 63 to 67 inclusive?

It's turn 65, and I'm playing Snake on a 7x7 grid since the borders are x=0/x=7 and y=0/y=7. That means the grid goes from (0,0) to (7,7), but since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think? Let me confirm.\n> \n> The border cells are x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7, so cells like (0,y), (7,y), (x,0), (x,7) are walls. Also, internal obstacles: [(5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4)]. So these are blocked cells.\n> \n> Snake positions: Head is at (2,3), and direction is L, which is left, so moving towards decreasing x. Snake body: [(2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3)].

Countdown decreases every turn, including current.\n> \n> Current turn is 65, so for (3,6), life span 4, it will disappear after turn 65 + 3 = turn 68? Let's see: at turn t, life span N, it disappears after N turns, so if eaten on or before turn t + N - 1? Better to think: countdown decreases each turn, starting from current turn.\n> \n> So for a food with life span L at turn t, it can be eaten until turn t + L - 1, and disappears at turn t + L.\n> \n> For example, at turn 65, food with life 4: after turn 65, countdown to 3, then turn 66: countdown 2, turn 67: countdown 1, turn 68: countdown 0 and disappears.

So it's a 6x6 playable grid? x from 1 to 6 inclusive is 6 cells, y from 1 to 6 inclusive is 6 cells, so yes, 6x6 grid.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: [(5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4)]. So these cells are blocked and I can't move there.\n> \n> Snake positions: Head is at (2,2), and the body segments follow: (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4). Head direction is D, which is down, so moving (x,y-1) since down decreases y.\n> \n> Head direction D means moving down, so if it moves down, y decreases? Let's check the movement constraints: U (x,y+1), D (x,y-1), L (x-1,y), R (x+1,y). Yes, D is (x,y-1), so decreasing y.\n> \n> But the head is at (2,2), and direction is D, so if it moves down, it would go to (2,1), but y=1 is within bounds, and (2,1) should be playable unless it's a wall or obstacle. Walls are borders at y=0 and y=7, so y=1 is inside, and no internal obstacle at (2,1), so it should be fine.\n> \n> Now, food positions:\n> \n> - (3,6) with life span 3, value 1 (positive food)\n> \n> - (6,5) with life span 5, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (2,6) with life span 8, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> All food is positive, no negative food mentioned. Value is 1 for all, so all give +1 score and increase length when eaten.\n> \n> Life span: for (3,6) it's 3, meaning it disappears after 3 turns including current, so on turn 66, 67, 68, gone by turn 69? Life span decreases every turn including current, so if life span is N, it lasts N turns starting from now.\n> \n> For (3,6): life span 3 on turn 66, so it will be there on turn 66, 67, 68, and disappear after that, so gone on turn 69.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,5): life span 5, present on turns 66 to 70, gone on 71.\n> \n> (2,6): life span 8, present on turns 66 to 73, gone on 74.\n> \n> Snake head is at (2,2), direction D.\n> \n> I need to think 5+ turns ahead and prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> First, let's map the grid to visualize.\n> \n> Grid: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4)\n> \n> So let's list all blocked cells:\n> \n> - Borders: x=0, x=7 for all y; y=0, y=7 for all x. But since playable area is 1-6, borders are outside.\n> \n> - Internal: (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), (4,4), (5,2)\n> \n> So blocked cells: (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), (4,4), (5,2)\n> \n> Now snake positions: head (2,2), then (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4)\n> \n> So the snake body occupies these cells. Head is at (2,2), which is part of the body, but head is separate.\n> \n> Positions are given as list, with head first, so index 0: (2,2) head, index 1: (2,3), index 2: (3,3), index 3: (4,3), index 4: (5,3), index 5: (5,4), index 6: (5,5), index 7: (4,5), index 8: (3,5), index 9: (3,6), index 10: (4,6), index 11: (5,6), index 12: (6,6), index 13: (6,5), index 14: (6,4)\n> \n> Total segments: 15 segments? List has 15 positions, so snake length is 15.\n> \n> Now, food at:\n> \n> - (3,6) – but (3,6) is occupied by the snake! Position index 9 is (3,6), which is part of the body.\n> \n> Food at (3,6,3,1) – but (3,6) has a body segment.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (6,5,5,1) – position index 13 is (6,5), so also occupied by body.\n> \n> Food at (2,6,8,1) – is (2,6) occupied? Snake positions: head (2,2), (2,3), then (3,3) etc., no (2,6) in the list. Let's check all y=6: positions: (3,6) index 9, (4,6) index 10, (5,6) index 11, (6,6) index 12. No (2,6), so (2,6) is free.\n> \n> But (3,6) and (6,5) have food, but they are currently occupied by snake body.\n> \n> Special case: food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves onto it.\n> \n> So for (3,6), it's under the body at index 9, which is segment (3,6).\n> \n> Similarly, (6,5) is under index 13, segment (6,5).\n> \n> (2,6) is free, no body there.\n> \n> Now, head direction is D, down, so from (2,2), moving down would go to (2,1).\n> \n> Possible moves from current position (2,2) with direction D.\n> \n> Since direction is D, I can move U, D, L, R, but no instant reverse: cannot move opposite to current direction. Current direction is D, so opposite is U. So I cannot move U (up) next turn.\n> \n> Allowed moves: since D is down, opposite is U, so I can move D, L, or R. Not U.\n> \n> From (2,2):\n> \n> - Move D (down): to (2,1)\n> \n> - Move L (left): to (1,2)\n> \n> - Move R (right): to (3,2)\n> \n> Now, check if these are valid:\n> \n> (2,1): is it within bounds? x=2, y=1, y=1 is not border, borders are y=0 and y=7, so y=1 is playable. Is it blocked? Internal obstacles: (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), (4,4), (5,2). (2,1) not in list, and not border, so should be free. But is it occupied by snake? Snake positions: all positions are from (2,2) to (6,4), no (2,1), so yes, (2,1) is free and safe to move to.\n> \n> (1,2): x=1,y=2. But internal obstacle (1,2) is listed, so it's a wall, cannot move there. Obstacle at (1,2), so blocked.\n> \n> (3,2): x=3,y=2. Is it blocked? Internal obstacles: (5,2) is blocked, but (3,2) not listed. Borders ok. Snake: positions include (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), etc. (3,2) not in snake positions, so should be free.\n> \n> Snake positions: (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), ... no (3,2), so yes free.\n> \n> But there might be a food? Food at (3,6), (6,5), (2,6), not (3,2), so free.\n> \n> So from (2,2), possible moves:\n> \n> - D: to (2,1) – safe\n> \n> - L: to (1,2) – but obstacle, invalid\n> \n> - R: to (3,2) – safe\n> \n> Cannot move U because reverse.\n> \n> So only two options: D to (2,1) or R to (3,2).\n> \n> Now, I need to think about the food and plan 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> Food at (3,6) with life span 3: disappears after turn 68, so need to eat by turn 68.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,5) life span 5, by turn 70.\n> \n> (2,6) life span 8, by turn 73.\n> \n> But (3,6) and (6,5) are under body, so I need to move the body away first.\n> \n> First, let's consider the snake movement.\n> \n> The snake is long, 15 segments.\n> \n> Current head position (2,2), direction D.\n> \n> If I move D to (2,1), then head is at (2,1), direction becomes D (since I moved down).\n> \n> Then from there, I can move to adjacent cells.\n> \n> Similarly, if I move R to (3,2), head at (3,2), direction R.\n> \n> Now, I need to get to the food.\n> \n> But food at (3,6) is under body at (3,6), which is segment index 9.\n> \n> To eat it, I need the body to move away from (3,6), then head to move to (3,6).\n> \n> Similarly for (6,5).\n> \n> (2,6) is free, so I can eat it directly if I go there.\n> \n> But (2,6) is at y=6, x=2, and head is at (2,2), so same x, different y.\n> \n> Now, the tail is at (6,4), which is segment 14.\n> \n> When the snake moves, the tail moves, so cells are freed.\n> \n> I need to think about the path.\n> \n> Also, Tail Reward Danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> Currently, tail is at (6,4). Where is the food? Food at (3,6), (6,5), (2,6). (6,5) is under body, but tail is at (6,4), not (6,5). (6,5) is occupied by segment 13.\n> \n> Let's see the tail movement.\n> \n> The snake moves step by step. Each turn, head moves to a new cell, and tail moves forward, so the last segment is removed unless food is eaten.\n> \n> If I eat food, length increases, so tail doesn't move.\n> \n> But for now, no food eaten.\n> \n> First, I need to decide the action for turn 66.\n> \n> Options: D or R.\n> \n> Let me simulate both.\n> \n> Option 1: Move D to (2,1) on turn 66.\n> \n> Then new head position: (2,1)\n> \n> Direction: D\n> \n> Snake positions: new head (2,1), then previous head (2,2) becomes body, so positions: [(2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5)] and tail (6,4) is removed? When head moves to new cell, the tail is removed unless food eaten.\n> \n> Sequence: when head moves to a new cell, the snake grows only if food is eaten; otherwise, tail is removed.\n> \n> So if no food eaten, new positions: head at new position, then all previous positions except the tail is removed.\n> \n> So after move to (2,1): head at (2,1), then body: previous positions from index 0 to 13, but index 0 was (2,2), now becomes first body segment, index 1 (2,3) second, up to index 13 (6,5), and index 14 (6,4) is removed.\n> \n> Previous positions: 15 segments.\n> \n> After move: head to (2,1), then the first 14 segments of previous become the body, but since no growth, the tail is removed, so new positions: [ (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5) ]\n> \n> (6,5) was index 13, now it's the last body segment, and (6,4) is gone.\n> \n> Food at (6,5) was under the body, but now after this move, (6,5) is still occupied by the snake?

To free (3,6), the snake needs to move so that the segment that was at (3,6) moves away, and no other segment is there when head arrives.\n> \n> Since the snake moves as a chain, (3,6) will be occupied until the segment at that position moves to the next cell.\n> \n> For example, when the head moves, segment 1 moves to where head was, segment 2 to where segment 1 was, and so on, down to segment 14 moves to where segment 13 was, and segment 15 (tail) is removed.\n> \n> Let's think of the segments shifting.\n> \n> After one move, if head moves to new cell, then new position 0: new head\n> \n> Position 1: old position 0\n> \n> Position 2: old position 1\n> \n> ...\n> \n> Position k: old position k-1 for k from 1 to 14\n> \n> Position 14: old position 13?

P14 is gone.\n> \n> For example, if move to (2,1):\n> \n> New positions: H = (2,1), then P0 = (2,2), P1 = (2,3), P2 = (3,3), P3 = (4,3), P4 = (5,3), P5 = (5,4), P6 = (5,5), P7 = (4,5), P8 = (3,5), P9 = (3,6), P10 = (4,6), P11 = (5,6), P12 = (6,6), P13 = (6,5)  // P14 (6,4) removed.\n> \n> So (3,6) is still occupied by new position 9, which was old P9.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,5) is now new position 14, tail.\n> \n> If I move to (3,2):\n> \n> H = (3,2), then P0 = (2,2), P1 = (2,3), P2 = (3,3), P3 = (4,3), P4 = (5,3), P5 = (5,4), P6 = (5,5), P7 = (4,5), P8 = (3,5), P9 = (3,6), P10 = (4,6), P11 = (5,6), P12 = (6,6), P13 = (6,5)  // P14 removed, (6,5) is now tail.\n> \n> In both cases, (3,6) is still occupied, and (6,5) is now the tail in the first case or not in the second.\n> \n> For (3,6) to be free, the segment that is there needs to move away. Since it's an internal segment, it will move only when the snake moves, and it shifts position.\n> \n> Specifically, the segment at (3,6) will move to the position of the next segment when the head moves.\n> \n> For example, if the head moves, the segment at old P8 (3,5) moves to old P9 (3,6)? No.\n> \n> From above: after move, new position 8 is old P8, which was (3,5), and new position 9 is old P9, which is (3,6), so (3,6) is still occupied by the same segment until that segment moves to a different cell.\n> \n> The segment at (3,6) will move when it becomes closer to the head or something.\n> \n> Let's think when the cell (3,6) is vacated.\n> \n> The cell (3,6) is occupied by a segment. That segment will leave (3,6) when the snake moves and that particular segment moves to a new position.\n> \n> For example, the segment currently at (3,6) is segment 9. When the snake moves, if no food eaten, segment 9 will move to where segment 8 was? No.\n> \n> In the shifting, when head moves, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment in front of it.\n> \n> Specifically, for segment k, it moves to the position that was occupied by segment k-1, but since segments shift, new position i is old position i-1 for i>=1.\n> \n> For a fixed cell, it is vacated when the segment that was there moves to a new cell, and no new segment comes in, but since the snake is contiguous, when a segment moves, it leaves its cell, and the cell may be occupied by the next segment or not, depending.\n> \n> In this case, for (3,6), it is occupied by segment 9. When the snake moves, segment 9 will move to the position that was previously occupied by segment 8, which is (3,5), but (3,5) is currently occupied, so after move, segment 9 moves to (3,5), and (3,6) is occupied by segment 10 which moves to (3,6)? Let's see.\n> \n> Old positions:\n> P8: (3,5)\n> P9: (3,6)\n> P10: (4,6)\n> \n> After move (no food), new positions:\n> New P8: old P8 = (3,5)  // this is the segment that was at P8, now at new P8 position (3,5)\n> New P9: old P9 = (3,6)  // segment that was at P9, now at new P9 position (3,6)\n> But the positions: new P8 is at old P8 position (3,5), new P9 is at old P9 position (3,6), so the cell (3,6) is still occupied by the same segment, just the index changed.\n> \n> The segment that was at (3,6) is still at (3,6) after the move, because it moved to the position it was already at? No.\n> \n> When the snake moves, each body segment moves to the position of the segment in front of it.\n> \n> For example, the segment behind the head moves to where the head was.\n> \n> In general, for body segment i, it moves to the position that was occupied by segment i-1.\n> \n> In terms of positions:\n> \n> After head moves to new cell, body segment 1 moves to old head position, body segment 2 moves to old position of segment 1, and so on, body segment k moves to old position of segment k-1.\n> \n> For segment that was at position S, it will move to the position of the segment immediately in front of it.\n> \n> For segment at (3,6), which is old P9, it is behind P8 at (3,5), so when the snake moves, segment P9 will move to the position of P8, which is (3,5).\n> \n> Then, the position (3,6) will be occupied by the segment that was behind it, P10, which was at (4,6), and P10 will move to the position of P9, which is (3,6).\n> \n> So after the move, the cell (3,6) is now occupied by the segment that was at P10, (4,6), which moves to (3,6).\n> \n> Similarly, (4,6) is vacated and may be occupied by P11 if no growth.\n> \n> In summary, for a cell occupied by an internal segment, when the snake moves, that cell will be occupied by the next segment in line, unless it's the tail.\n> \n> For (3,6), it is not the tail, so when the snake moves, (3,6) will still be occupied, but by a different segment, the one that was behind.\n> \n> So it never becomes free unless the segment that was there moves and no one replaces it, but for internal cells, it's always occupied as long as the snake is there.\n> \n> The only way to free a cell is if it is the tail position, and when the snake moves, the tail is removed, so that cell is freed.\n> \n> Or if the snake grows, the tail doesn't move, so the cell is not freed, but new cells are added.\n> \n> For a cell under the body, it can only be eaten when it is not occupied by any snake segment at the time the head moves there.\n> \n> So for (3,6), it is currently occupied, so to eat it, I need that at some future turn, the snake has moved such that (3,6) is not occupied, then I can move head there.\n> \n> Since the snake is moving, (3,6) will only be free if it was the tail position and the snake moves without growing, freeing it.\n> \n> Otherwise, if it's an internal position, it stays occupied.\n> \n> For example, if the tail is at (3,6), and I move the snake, tail moves away, freeing (3,6), then I can move head to it later.\n> \n> But currently, (3,6) is not the tail; it's an internal segment.\n> \n> The tail is at (6,4).\n> \n> To make (3,6) the tail, I need to move the snake in a way that the segment at (3,6) becomes the tail, which means I need to shorten the snake or something, but I can't shorten; only when I don't eat, the tail moves.\n> \n> The tail position changes over time.\n> \n> The cell (3,6) will be occupied until the segment that is there becomes the tail and the snake moves without growing, freeing that cell.\n> \n> But since the snake is long, it will take many moves for that segment to become the tail.\n> \n> For instance, the segment at (3,6) is index 9, so it will take 9 moves for it to become the head if no growth, but it doesn't become head; the head is separate.\n> \n> The distance from head: head to this segment is 9 steps away, so it will take at least 9 moves for this segment to be the tail, assuming no growth.\n> \n> Currently, the tail is index 14, so segment 9 is 5 segments away from tail (indices 9,10,11,12,13,14, so 5 segments between head and tail? Index 9 is position 9, head 0, tail 14, so segment 9 is 9 steps from head, and 5 steps from tail (since 14-9=5).\n> \n> To make segment 9 the tail, I need to have the tail end at that segment, which means I need to move the snake such that after some moves, the segment at index 9 becomes the last one.\n> \n> Since each move the tail is removed, after k moves, the segment that was at position k will be the new tail if no growth.\n> \n> After m moves, the new tail is the segment that was at position m from the tail or something.\n> \n> Initial tail is P14.\n> \n> After one move without growth, new tail is P13.\n> \n> After two moves, new tail is P12, and so on.\n> \n> After k moves, new tail is P_{14-k}\n> \n> For example, after 5 moves, new tail is P9, which is (3,6).\n> \n> Similarly, after 5 moves, the cell (3,6) will be freed when the snake moves the 6th time? Let's see.\n> \n> After 5 moves without eating, the segment at P9 will be the tail.\n> \n> Then on the 6th move, when the snake moves, the tail (which is P9) moves to new position, and the cell it was in is freed.\n> \n> So after 5 moves, at the beginning of turn 66+5=71, the tail is at what was P9, (3,6).\n> \n> Then on turn 71, when I move, the tail leaves (3,6), freeing it.\n> \n> Then on turn 71, after the move, (3,6) is free, and I can move head to it on turn 72 or later.\n> \n> But the food at (3,6) has life span 3, so it disappears after turn 68, so by turn 69 it's gone. Turn 66,67,68 present, gone on 69.\n> \n> So to free (3,6) by moving, I need it to be the tail and move away, but that would take at least 5 moves to make it the tail, then on the 6th move it frees, but by turn 71, which is after turn 68, so food is already gone. Turn 66+5=71, turn 71 is after turn 68, so food disappeared.\n> \n> Similarly, for (6,5), which is P13, after 1 move, it becomes tail (as in the first option), then on next move it can be freed.\n> \n> Let's calculate for (3,6): P9, index 9. Distance from tail: tail index 14, so 14-9=5 positions behind. After 5 moves, it becomes the tail. Then on the 6th move, it is freed.\n> \n> But moves: after 5 moves, at turn 66+5=71, the tail is at (3,6). Then on turn 71, when I move, the tail leaves (3,6), so at the end of turn 71, (3,6) is free.\n> \n> But food life span: on turn 66, life span 3, so present on 66,67,68. After turn 68, it disappears, so on turn 69,70,71, it's not there.

This is not occupied, I think? Let's see: snake positions: (3,6) is there, (2,6) is not listed. Cells: x from 1-6, y from 1-6. (2,6) should be free, unless obstacle. Obstacles: (5,2),(4,4),(1,2),(1,4),(1,5). No (2,6), so (2,6) is empty and has food.\n> \n> - (3,4): value 1, life span 10. Is this occupied? Snake: (4,3),(5,3),(5,4), etc. (3,4) not in snake positions. Obstacles? (4,4) is obstacle, but (3,4) is not listed, so should be free.\n> \n> But (3,4) has food, and it's not occupied by snake or obstacle? Snake positions don't have (3,4), obstacles have (4,4) but not (3,4), so (3,4) should be free with food.\n> \n> Now, for food under body: (3,6) and (6,5) are under snake body.\n> \n> According to rules, food can be eaten only if body moves away and head moves onto it.\n> \n> Also, tail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because after eating, tail grows and causes collision.\n> \n> First, current head position: (3,2), direction R.\n> \n> Possible moves from here:\n> \n> - Up: to (3,3)? (3,3) is a body segment, segment 3. But (3,3) is occupied, so moving there would cause collision? Not necessarily, because the tail moves.\n> \n> When I move, the head moves to new position, and the tail moves forward, so cells that were body might be freed.\n> \n> Specifically, collision happens if head moves to a cell that will be occupied by body after the move.\n> \n> After moving, the new head position, and the body shifts, so the tail cell is vacated.\n> \n> Collision: head cannot move to a cell that is part of the body except the tail, because the tail will move.\n> \n> From the rules: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, moving to tail is safe, as long as it's not the only segment or something, but here snake has multiple segments.\n> \n> Also, for other body segments, if head moves to them, it collides unless that segment moves away.\n> \n> But generally, the only safe body cell to move to is the tail cell, because it moves away.\n> \n> Other body cells remain or move, but since the snake shifts, only the tail cell is vacated; other body cells are still occupied after move.\n> \n> Let's think carefully.\n> \n> Suppose snake segments: H, B1, B2, ..., T\n> \n> After move, new head position, then B1 becomes new neck, etc., T is removed if no food eaten, or kept if food eaten.\n> \n> But when no food eaten, tail is removed, so moving to tail cell is safe because tail moves away.\n> \n> Moving to any other body cell: that cell will still be occupied after move, so head would collide.\n> \n> For example, if head moves to a cell where B1 is, after move, B1 becomes the new position for what was H, but since head moves to B1's position, and B1 moves to where B2 was, etc., so the cell that was B1 is now occupied by the new head? No.\n> \n> Initial positions: H at P_h, B1 at P1, B2 at P2, ..., T at P_t.\n> \n> After moving head to a new position P_new:\n> \n> - If P_new is not a food cell, then the new snake is P_new, P_h, P1, P2, ..., up to second last segment, so P_t is removed.\n> \n> So the cells occupied after move: P_new, P_h, P1, P2, ..., P_{t-1}\n> \n> P_t is vacated.\n> \n> Therefore, moving to P_t is safe because it becomes empty.\n> \n> Moving to P_h, P1, etc., those cells will be occupied after move, so collision.\n> \n> Specifically, moving to any segment except the tail will cause collision because that cell will still be part of the body.\n> \n> Only moving to the tail cell is safe, as tail moves away.\n> \n> Additionally, moving to empty cells is safe.\n> \n> Now, in this case, head at (3,2), possible moves:\n> \n> - Up: to (3,3)\n> \n> (3,3) is segment 3, which is not tail. Tail is (6,5). So (3,3) is a body segment, moving there would cause collision because after move, (3,3) will be occupied by the new body (since head was at (3,2), which becomes body).\n> \n> Current segments: index 0: (3,2) head, 1: (2,2), 2: (2,3), 3: (3,3), 4: (4,3), etc.\n> \n> If I move up to (3,3), which is current position of segment 3.\n> \n> After move, new head at (3,3), and body: (3,2) becomes segment 1, (2,2) becomes segment 2, (2,3) becomes segment 3, and so on, up to (6,6) becomes segment 13, and (6,5) is removed? Tail is (6,5), segment 14.\n> \n> After move, segments: new head at (3,3), then previous head (3,2) at index 1, then (2,2) at index 2, (2,3) at index 3, (3,3) was index 3, but now it's head, so the body starts from (3,2) down to (6,6), and (6,5) is gone.\n> \n> Positions after move: head at (3,3), then body: (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3) — but (3,3) is now head, so the body includes (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), and then (4,3) (was index 4), (5,3), (5,4), ..., up to (6,6), and (6,5) is not included since tail moved.\n> \n> But (3,3) was occupied by segment 3, and now it's the head, so no new body at that cell yet, but the cell (3,3) is now head, which is fine, but before moving, (3,3) was a body cell, and I moved to it.\n> \n> After move, the cell (3,3) has the head, so it was occupied but now it's head, but since I moved to it, and it was body, but in terms of collision, since after move it's head, not body, it should be okay? But according to the rule, if head moves to a body segment, it collides, but for the tail it's an exception.\n> \n> I think I'm confusing myself.\n> \n> Standard Snake: when you move, if the head moves to a cell that is occupied by a body segment that is not the tail, it dies because after the move, that body segment is still there, but shifted, but the cell is occupied by the segment that was before.\n> \n> In this case, moving to (3,3): before move, (3,3) is body segment 3.\n> \n> After move, the new body at (3,3) is the segment that was head, (3,2), which is now at position (3,3)? No.\n> \n> Initial: segment 0: (3,2) head\n> \n> Segment 1: (2,2)\n> \n> Segment 2: (2,3)\n> \n> Segment 3: (3,3)\n> \n> Segment 4: (4,3)\n> \n> ...\n> \n> After moving head up to (3,3):\n> \n> New head: (3,3)\n> \n> Then the body: the previous head (3,2) becomes the new segment 1\n> \n> Previous segment 1 (2,2) becomes new segment 2\n> \n> Previous segment 2 (2,3) becomes new segment 3\n> \n> Previous segment 3 (3,3) was at that position, but now the head is there, so the body starts from previous segment 1: (2,2) becomes new segment 2? Let's list:\n> \n> New positions:\n> \n> - Head: (3,3)  // moved to\n> \n> - Segment 1: previous head (3,2)\n> \n> - Segment 2: previous segment 1 (2,2)\n> \n> - Segment 3: previous segment 2 (2,3)\n> \n> - Segment 4: previous segment 3 (3,3) — but (3,3) is now the head, so previous segment 3 (3,3) is no longer there; instead, segment 4 is previous segment 4 (4,3), and so on.\n> \n> Since no food eaten, the tail is removed, so the last segment (6,5) is not included.\n> \n> The new segments are:\n> \n> - Index 0: head at (3,3)\n> \n> - Index 1: (3,2)  // previous head\n> \n> - Index 2: (2,2)  // previous seg1\n> \n> - Index 3: (2,3)  // previous seg2\n> \n> - Index 4: (4,3)  // previous seg4?

But for the move itself, when I move to (3,3), it was a body cell (not tail), so it should be a collision because that cell was occupied and will be part of the body after move? After move, (3,3) has the head, so it's not a body cell, but the issue is that during the move, the head is moving to a cell that is currently occupied by body, which is not allowed except for tail.\n> \n> From the rules: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment).

This path defers eating opportunities but ensures the snake remains alive to target high-value food like (3,4) in later turns.\n",

It's turn 69, and I'm playing Snake on a 7x7 grid since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), but there are internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4). I should list all obstacles for clarity.\n> \n> Walls: border cells, so anything with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 is out of bounds. Internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4). So cells to avoid: all border walls and these internal points.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (4,1), then (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6). That's 15 segments. Head direction is down, which is D, meaning moving towards increasing y? Let's confirm coordinates.\n> \n> Typically in grids, (x,y) with y increasing upwards or downwards? The movement: U is (x,y+1), which might imply y increases up, but in many games, y increases down. Let's see the definition: U (x,y+1), D (x,y-1). So if U is (x,y+1), that suggests y=0 is bottom and y increases upwards? But in the walls, y=0 and y=7 are borders, so probably y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top? No, walls are y=0 and y=7, so if U is (x,y+1), that would be moving up if y=0 is bottom. But let's see the snake positions.\n> \n> Snake head at (4,1), and direction D, down. Down is (x,y-1), so decreasing y. So if head is at (4,1) and moves down, it would go to (4,0), but y=0 is a wall, so it can't. But current position is (4,1), and it hasn't moved yet; this is the state before movement.\n> \n> Current head direction is D, meaning it was moving down to reach (4,1). Positions: [(4,1), (4,2), ...] so head is (4,1), then next is (4,2), which is above it if y increases upwards? (4,1) to (4,2) — if y=2 > y=1, and U is (x,y+1), so from (4,1) U would go to (4,2), but the body is at (4,2), so the snake was moving down to (4,1), meaning from a higher y to lower y. Let's think.\n> \n> Positions: head (4,1), then body (4,2). So the head is at y=1, body at y=2. Since direction is D (down), that means it was previously at a higher y and moved down to (4,1). So moving down decreases y. Therefore, y=0 is the bottom row, y=7 is the top row? Walls at y=0 and y=7, so y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top. U (x,y+1) moves up (increasing y), D (x,y-1) moves down (decreasing y). Similarly, L (x-1,y) left, R (x+1,y) right.\n> \n> So grid: x from 1 to 6 (since walls x=0 and x=7), y from 1 to 6 (walls y=0 and y=7). But internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4). Also, food: (6,5) with life span 3, value 1; (2,6) with life span 5, value 1; (3,4) with life span 8, value 1. All food is positive since value=1.\n> \n> Now, snake length 15, head at (4,1) moving down? Direction is D, but at (4,1), if it moves down D to (4,0), which is a wall, so it must change direction. It cannot move down because y-1=0 is wall. Similarly, it can move left, right, or up? But it cannot move opposite to current direction instantly? Current direction is D, so it cannot move U (up) next turn because that would be instant reverse. Rule: \"No instant reverse\": Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn. So since current direction is D, it cannot move U immediately.\n> \n> Possible moves from (4,1):\n> \n> - Down: (4,0) but y=0 wall, invalid.\n> \n> - Up: (4,2) but that's where the body is? (4,2) is the second segment, but let's see if it's occupied.\n> \n> When moving, the head moves to a new cell, and the tail moves away, so the cell (4,2) is currently occupied by the body, but after move, if head moves elsewhere, the tail moves, so (4,2) might be free later, but for collision, head cannot move to a cell that will be occupied after the move, except the tail cell if it moves away.\n> \n> Rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, when moving, the head moves to a new cell, then each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, so the tail moves away from its current position.\n> \n> Therefore, if the head moves to the current tail position, it's ok because the tail moves, so no collision. Similarly, for other body cells, they don't move until after the head, so if head moves to a body cell, it collides unless it's the tail.\n> \n> Specifically: the head moves first to a new cell. If that cell is occupied by any body segment except the tail, it collides. If it moves to the tail cell, it's ok because the tail will move away, so head and tail are not in the same cell after movement.\n> \n> Also, walls are deadly.\n> \n> Back to (4,1):\n> \n> - Move D: to (4,0), wall, invalid.\n> \n> - Move U: to (4,2), but (4,2) is the second segment of the snake, which is not the tail. The tail is (5,6). (4,2) is occupied by body, so moving there would cause collision, since it's not the tail.\n> \n> Snake positions: index 0: head (4,1), index 1: (4,2), index 2: (3,2), etc. up to index 14: (5,6) tail.\n> \n> So (4,2) is body segment, not tail, so moving to (4,2) would cause collision.\n> \n> - Move L: to (3,1). Is (3,1) free? Let's see occupied cells.\n> \n> Current snake positions: all these points are occupied. Also, walls and obstacles.\n> \n> First, list all forbidden cells for movement: walls and obstacles.\n> \n> Walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so cells (0,y) for all y, (7,y) for all y, (x,0) for all x, (x,7) for all x.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4)\n> \n> Snake positions: [(4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6)]\n> \n> So for head at (4,1), possible moves:\n> \n> - U: to (4,2) - but occupied by snake body (index 1), not tail, so collision.\n> \n> - D: to (4,0) - wall, invalid.\n> \n> - L: to (3,1) - is (3,1) occupied? Snake positions: (3,2), (2,2), etc., no (3,1). Walls: x=3,y=1, x from 1-6, y from 1-6, so (3,1) should be free? But is it an obstacle? Internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), no (3,1). So (3,1) is empty? But let's confirm.\n> \n> (3,1): x=3, y=1. Walls: y=0 and y=7 are borders, so (3,1) is within bounds. Not in internal obstacles. Not in snake positions? Snake: (3,2) is at y=2, not y=1. So (3,1) should be free.\n> \n> - R: to (5,1). (5,1): not in snake positions? Snake has (5,3), (5,4), etc., but not (5,1). Walls: no. Obstacles: (5,2) is obstacle, but (5,1) is different. So (5,1) should be free.\n> \n> (5,1) is at y=1, x=5. Internal obstacle is (5,2), which is different cell. So (5,1) is free.\n> \n> But also, must consider if moving there is safe.\n> \n> So from (4,1), possible moves: L to (3,1) or R to (5,1). Cannot U or D because U to body, D to wall.

So at turn 69, life span given, so for (6,5) life span 3, it will disappear after 3 turns, so at turn 72 or before? Countdown decreases every turn, including current turn 69, so if life span is L, it disappears after L more turns? Let's read.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span).

When is it eaten?\n> \n> Food can be eaten when the head moves onto it during a turn.\n> \n> At the start of turn, if head moves to food cell, it is eaten that turn.\n> \n> Countdown decreases at each turn, so after the turn, if not eaten, countdown decreases.\n> \n> For example, at turn 69, food has life span 3, so after turn 69, if not eaten, life span becomes 2; after turn 70, if not eaten, becomes 1; after turn 71, if not eaten, disappears before turn 72? Or at the end of turn?\n> \n> Typically, the countdown decreases after the turn or during?\n> \n> The rule says: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> But for eating, when head moves to it during a turn.\n> \n> Assume: at the beginning of turn, food has certain life span.

No negative food here.\n> \n> Life span: for (6,5), it disappears after 2 turns, including current turn. Since current turn is 70, it will disappear after turn 71? Let's read: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\", and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So for a food with life span L, it appears at turn T, and disappears after T + L - 1? Or at the end of turn T + L?\n> \n> The countdown decreases every turn, including the current turn. So when we are at turn t, and food has life span s, it can be eaten on turns where the countdown is greater than 0.\n> \n> At the start of turn t, if food has life span s, after this turn, it decreases to s-1. If s=1, it disappears after this turn, meaning you can eat it on this turn, but not after.\n> \n> Standard way: if life span is s at turn t, it will last for s more turns, including turn t. So it can be eaten on turns t, t+1, ..., t+s-1. After turn t+s-1, it disappears.\n> \n> For example, food at (6,5) with life span 2 at turn 70. So it can be eaten on turn 70 or 71. After turn 71, it's gone.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,6) life span 4: can be eaten on turn 70,71,72,73.\n> \n> (3,4) life span 7: turns 70 to 76.\n> \n> (6,6) life span 10: turns 70 to 79.\n> \n> Now, snake head is at (5,1), direction R (right). So from (5,1), possible moves: U, D, L, R. But cannot move opposite to current direction. Current direction is R, so cannot move L (left) on next turn. Also, need to avoid walls, obstacles, and body collisions except tail.\n> \n> First, let's map the grid to visualize.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6. Walls at borders, but borders are x=0,7 and y=0,7, so cells (1,1) to (6,6) are playable.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4)\n> \n> So blocked cells: (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), (4,4), (5,2)\n> \n> (1,2), (1,4), (1,5) are all in column x=1, y=2,4,5.\n> \n> Now snake positions: let's list all occupied cells.\n> \n> Head: (5,1)\n> \n> Body: (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6)\n> \n> Tail is (4,6)\n> \n> Now, the snake is long, 15 segments, so many cells are occupied.\n> \n> Food locations:\n> \n> - (6,5): value 1, life 2\n> \n> - (2,6): value 1, life 4\n> \n> - (3,4): value 1, life 7\n> \n> - (6,6): value 1, life 10\n> \n> I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks. Prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> First, from current position (5,1), direction R.\n> \n> Possible moves: U (up to (5,2)), D (down to (5,0)? But y=0 is wall, so invalid. y=1, down would be y=0, which is wall, so D is invalid.\n> \n> L (left to (4,1)), but (4,1) is occupied by body, and it's not the tail? Let's see.\n> \n> The tail is at (4,6), so (4,1) is a body segment, not tail. Moving to (4,1) would cause collision because head touches body.\n> \n> R (right to (6,1)), (6,1) is within bounds? x=6, y=1, x=6 is not wall? Walls are x=0 and x=7, so x=6 is playable, y=1 is playable. But is it occupied?\n> \n> (6,1) is not in snake positions, and not an obstacle. Snake positions: (5,1), (4,1), etc., no (6,1). Obstacles are (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), (4,4), (5,2), so (6,1) is free.\n> \n> Also, U to (5,2): (5,2) is an obstacle! Internal obstacle (5,2), so blocked.\n> \n> D to (5,0): y=0 wall, invalid.\n> \n> L to (4,1): occupied by body, collision.\n> \n> R to (6,1): free, as above.\n> \n> So only possible move is R to (6,1). Is that right?\n> \n> Current position (5,1), move R to (6,1).\n> \n> But direction is R, so moving R is fine, not opposite.\n> \n> Now, after moving, the snake moves, so tail moves away, etc.\n> \n> But I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n> \n> Since only one possible move this turn? Let me confirm.\n> \n> Possible actions from (5,1):\n> \n> - U: (5,2) - but (5,2) is internal obstacle, so wall, cannot move there.\n> \n> - D: (5,0) - y=0 wall, invalid.\n> \n> - L: (4,1) - occupied by snake body (the second segment), so collision.\n> \n> - R: (6,1) - not occupied, not wall, so valid.\n> \n> So indeed, only possible move is R to (6,1).\n> \n> But the action is for turn 70, I need to output action sequence for multiple turns.\n> \n> Answer format: Action sequence for turn 70, 71, etc., and thinking.\n> \n> But for turn 70, only one choice, so I must move R.\n> \n> Then, after moving to (6,1), what next?\n> \n> Turn 70: move R to (6,1)\n> \n> Now snake head at (6,1), direction now R (since moved right).\n> \n> Snake positions: after moving, head is at (6,1), and the body: since snake moves, the tail end is removed, but when it eats food, it grows.\n> \n> No food eaten at (6,1), so snake moves to (6,1), and tail (4,6) is removed? Let's see the movement.\n> \n> Standard snake: when moving without eating, head moves to new cell, tail is removed. So new positions: head at new position, then the previous head to second last, but all segments shift.\n> \n> Positions: new head at (6,1), then previous head (5,1) becomes second segment, then (4,1) becomes third, and so on, up to the tail. But tail (4,6) is removed, so the new tail is (3,6) or something.\n> \n> Current positions before move: [(5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6)]\n> \n> After moving R to (6,1) without eating: new head (6,1), then the segments from index 1 to 14 become the body, so (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,6). And (4,6) is removed.\n> \n> So new positions: [(6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,6)]\n> \n> Tail is (3,6).\n> \n> Direction: since moved R, current direction is R.\n> \n> Now turn 71.\n> \n> Head at (6,1), direction R.\n> \n> Possible moves: U (up to (6,2)), D (down to (6,0) invalid), L (left to (5,1)), R (right to (7,1) invalid, x=7 wall).\n> \n> So U, L, or R? R to (7,1) is x=7, wall, invalid.\n> \n> D to (6,0) y=0 wall, invalid.\n> \n> So possible: U to (6,2) or L to (5,1).\n> \n> (5,1) is now occupied by the second segment, which is body, not tail. Tail is at (3,6).\n> \n> (5,1) is the second segment, so moving to (5,1) would cause collision.\n> \n> Unless it's the tail, but it's not.\n> \n> So L to (5,1) is invalid.\n> \n> U to (6,2): is (6,2) free? Let's see.\n> \n> (6,2) not in obstacles: obstacles are (1,2),(1,4),(1,5),(4,4),(5,2), so (6,2) not obstacle.\n> \n> Not in snake positions: current positions: head (6,1), body (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), etc. (4,2) is there, but (6,2) not listed, so should be free.\n> \n> So only U is possible? U to (6,2).\n> \n> But let's confirm: from (6,1), move U to (6,2).\n> \n> Then, after that, on turn 71, move U.\n> \n> But I need to think about food and future moves.\n> \n> Also, food life spans: at turn 70, (6,5) life span 2, so can be eaten on turn 70 or 71.\n> \n> Turn 70 is over, we moved to (6,1), no food there, so not eaten.\n> \n> Now turn 71, (6,5) can be eaten if we go there, but life span 2, after turn 71, it disappears? Life span decreases each turn.\n> \n> At turn 70, life span 2, after turn 70, it becomes 1 for turn 71.

But in snake games, moving into the cell where the tail was is okay because the tail moves away, but here (5,1) is not the tail; it's a body segment that will still be there after the head moves.\n> \n> When the snake moves:\n> \n> - Head moves to a new position\n> \n> - Each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment\n> \n> - The tail segment is removed or moves, so the cell it occupied is freed.\n> \n> Specifically, if head moves to a new cell, the body follows, so the cell that was occupied by the tail is vacated.\n> \n> But if head moves to a cell that is currently occupied by a body segment, it only collides if that segment is not the tail at that moment.\n> \n> Rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, for a move to be safe:\n> \n> - The new head position must not be a wall or a body segment, except if it is the tail segment, and after the move, the tail moves away.\n> \n> In this case, moving to (5,1): (5,1) is currently occupied by the first body segment, which is not the tail. After head moves to (5,1), the body will shift: the segment at (5,1) moves to where? When head moves to (5,1), the segment that was at (5,1) will move to the next position, but since (5,1) is now the head, the body segments follow.\n> \n> Let's simulate:\n> \n> Current positions: [ (6,1)=head, (5,1), (4,1), ... , (3,6)=tail ]\n> \n> If I move left to (5,1):\n> \n> - New head position: (5,1)\n> \n> But (5,1) is currently occupied by the first body segment. After the move, the body shifts: the segment that was at (5,1) becomes part of the body, but since head is moving to (5,1), which was just vacated? No.\n> \n> When you move, the head goes to the new cell, then each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead.\n> \n> So, if head moves to (5,1), which was previously occupied by the first body segment, but at the time of move, that cell is occupied, so the head would be colliding with the body segment at (5,1) before the move.\n> \n> The rule is: before moving, if the target cell is occupied by a body segment (except the tail), it's a collision.\n> \n> In this case, (5,1) is occupied by a body segment that is not the tail, so moving there causes collision because head touches body.\n> \n> Moreover, it's the immediate next segment, so definitely collision.\n> \n> Moving to tail is only safe if it's the tail segment and it will move away.\n> \n> Here, (5,1) is not tail; tail is (3,6).\n> \n> So moving to (5,1) is invalid, collision.\n> \n> Similarly, moving down to (6,0) is wall, invalid.\n> \n> Moving right to (7,1) is wall, invalid.\n> \n> Moving up to (6,2) is free? (6,2) is not in the snake positions, and not a wall.\n> \n> Is (6,2) an obstacle? Internal obstacles are (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4). (6,2) is not listed, so it should be free.\n> \n> Also, not a border wall.\n> \n> So only possible move is Up to (6,2).\n> \n> But let me confirm the grid.\n> \n> x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n> \n> (6,2): x=6, y=2, not border, not in internal obstacles: internal are (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4). (5,2) is obstacle, but (6,2) is different.\n> \n> So (6,2) is empty.\n> \n> Therefore, for turn 71, the only possible action is U (up).\n> \n> But I need to think ahead multiple turns.\n> \n> So action for turn 71 must be U.\n> \n> Now, after moving U to (6,2), what is the new state?\n> \n> Turn 72: head at (6,2), previous position was (6,1), so head direction is U (since moved up).\n> \n> Now, possible moves from (6,2): U, D, L, R.\n> \n> But cannot move opposite to current direction, which is U, so cannot move D (down).\n> \n> So possible: U to (6,3), L to (5,2), R to (7,2).\n> \n> R to (7,2): x=7 is wall, so invalid.\n> \n> L to (5,2): (5,2) is an internal obstacle?

It's turn 73, and I'm playing Snake on a grid with walls and obstacles. The grid size isn't specified, but from the walls, it seems like x from 0 to 7 and y from 0 to 7, so an 8x8 grid? Border walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so cells from (0,0) to (7,7) I think, but walls occupy those borders, so the playable area might be from (1,1) to (6,6)? Let me confirm.\n> \n> Border cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7. That means all cells where x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. So the playable area is x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? But there are internal obstacles too.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: [(5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4)] – so these cells are also blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions: Head at (6,3), then body: (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5). That's 15 segments? Let me count: positions from index 0 to 14, so 15 cells. Head is (6,3), tail is (4,5).\n> \n> Snake head direction is U, which is up.

Life span decreases every turn, including current, so if life span is N, it disappears after N turns, meaning it will be gone on turn t + N or something? Let's see the notation.\n> \n> It says: Food Positions, Value and Life Span: (x,y, life_span, value). In the input, it's given as (x,y, life_span, value), but in the description, it was (x,y, value, life_span). I think there's a mismatch.\n> \n> Look: \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value: - (2, 6, 2, 1) - (3, 4, 4, 1) - (6, 6, 7, 1) - (5, 3, 10, 1)\"\n> \n> But in the core rules, it says \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span: - ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 )\" so it should be (x,y), value, life_span. But here it's listed as (x,y, life_span, value). Probably a typo in the state.\n> \n> In the state: \"(2, 6, 2, 1)\" – I think it's (x,y, life_span, value) with value last. Similarly, \"(3, 4, 4, 1)\" so life_span then value. But value is always 1 for all, since all are +1 food? Let's see: all have value 1, so positive food.\n> \n> - (2,6) life span 2, value 1\n> \n> - (3,4) life span 4, value 1\n> \n> - (6,6) life span 7, value 1\n> \n> - (5,3) life span 10, value 1\n> \n> But (5,3) is also a snake position? Snake positions include (5,3). Let's check: snake positions: [(6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5)]\n> \n> Yes, (5,3) is the 11th segment, index 10 if head is 0? Indices: 0: (6,3) head, 1: (6,2), 2: (6,1), 3: (5,1), 4: (4,1), 5: (4,2), 6: (3,2), 7: (2,2), 8: (2,3), 9: (3,3), 10: (4,3), 11: (5,3), 12: (5,4), 13: (5,5), 14: (4,5) tail.\n> \n> So (5,3) is occupied by the snake body. But food at (5,3) with life span 10 and value 1. Since it's under the body, it can only be eaten if the body moves away and the head moves onto it later.\n> \n> Now, current head position: (6,3), direction U (up). So moving up would go to (6,4)? Let's see possible moves.\n> \n> First, I need to find all possible actions for this turn, considering movement constraints and collisions.\n> \n> Current direction is U, so I can move U, L, or R, but not D (since D is opposite, instant reverse not allowed).\n> \n> Possible moves from (6,3):\n> \n> - U: (6,4)\n> \n> - D: not allowed, opposite direction\n> \n> - L: (5,3)\n> \n> - R: (7,3) but x=7 is wall, so invalid.\n> \n> Walls: border x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so (7,3) is out of bounds or wall, cannot move there.\n> \n> Also internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4). (5,2) is not relevant for head move now.\n> \n> So from (6,3):\n> \n> - U: to (6,4)\n> \n> - L: to (5,3)\n> \n> - R: to (7,3) but x=7 wall, invalid.\n> \n> - D: opposite, invalid.\n> \n> So only possible moves: U or L.\n> \n> Now, (5,3) is currently occupied by the snake body, but when I move, the snake moves, so if I move L to (5,3), what happens?\n> \n> The head moves to (5,3), but (5,3) is currently the 11th segment. When the head moves, the body follows, so the segment at (5,3) will move to the new head position only if it's adjacent, but let's think how snake moves.\n> \n> When snake moves, head goes to new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment before it. So if head moves to a new cell, the tail end moves forward, and the cell that was tail is vacated, unless it eats food.\n> \n> If head moves to a cell with food, it eats it, grows, so tail doesn't move, new segment added.\n> \n> But in this case, (5,3) has food on it? Food at (5,3) is present, but currently occupied by snake body.\n> \n> If I move head to (5,3), which is currently occupied by body, but since the body will move, it might be possible to eat the food if it's there after the body moves.\n> \n> But according to rules: food under body can be eaten only if body moves away and head moves onto it later.\n> \n> Specifically: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> So for (5,3), since it's currently occupied by body, if I move the head to (5,3) now, but the body is still there, I think I would collide with my own body.\n> \n> Let's think carefully.\n> \n> At the start of turn, before movement, head is at (6,3), body at (6,2), (6,1), etc., and (5,3) is occupied by a body segment.\n> \n> If I choose to move left to (5,3), the head attempts to move to (5,3). But (5,3) is currently occupied by a body segment. Since it's not the tail, moving into it would cause collision because that segment hasn't moved yet. Only the tail can be moved into because it will move away.\n> \n> Rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, if I move to a cell occupied by a non-tail body segment, it's collision and death.\n> \n> Here, (5,3) is the 11th segment, not the tail; tail is at (4,5). So (5,3) is a body segment, moving to it would cause collision.\n> \n> Therefore, moving L to (5,3) is invalid because it would collide with body.\n> \n> Similarly, moving U to (6,4) should be fine, as long as (6,4) is not wall or body.\n> \n> Now, is (6,4) occupied? Snake positions: let's list all occupied cells: from (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5). So (6,4) is not in this list, so not occupied. Also, walls: y=4 is not border, x=6 not border, and (6,4) not in internal obstacles. Internal obstacles are (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4) — (6,4) not there. So (6,4) should be free.\n> \n> Therefore, possible actions this turn: U to (6,4) or... what about L? L to (5,3) is invalid because of body collision, as we said.\n> \n> D and R are invalid, so only possible move is U to (6,4).\n> \n> Is that right? Only one choice?\n> \n> But let's confirm.\n> \n> Current direction U, so can move U, L, R but not D.\n> \n> R to (7,3): x=7 wall, invalid.\n> \n> L to (5,3): cell occupied by body (non-tail), so collision, invalid.\n> \n> U to (6,4): not occupied, not wall, so valid.\n> \n> So indeed, only possible move is U to (6,4).\n> \n> But the food at (5,3) has life span 10, so it will be there for a while, but I can't eat it now because I can't move there.\n> \n> Now, after moving U, head to (6,4), then the snake: head moves to (6,4), body segments shift: segment 1 (was at (6,2)) moves to (6,3), segment 2 (was (6,1)) moves to (6,2), and so on, up to tail at (4,5) might move if no food eaten.\n> \n> Since I didn't eat food (no food at (6,4)), so no growth, tail moves forward. The segment that was at (4,5) is vacated.\n> \n> Now, new snake positions: head at (6,4), then (6,3) [previous head], (6,2) [previous segment 1], (6,1) [prev seg2], (5,1) [prev seg3], (4,1) [prev seg4], (4,2) [prev seg5], (3,2) [prev seg6], (2,2) [prev seg7], (2,3) [prev seg8], (3,3) [prev seg9], (4,3) [prev seg10], (5,3) [prev seg11], but (5,3) was prev seg11, but since head moved to (6,4), and no growth, the tail end moves: the segment at (4,5) was tail, so it moves to where the second last was? Let's think.\n> \n> Snake positions before move: indices 0: (6,3) head, 1: (6,2), 2: (6,1), 3: (5,1), 4: (4,1), 5: (4,2), 6: (3,2), 7: (2,2), 8: (2,3), 9: (3,3), 10: (4,3), 11: (5,3), 12: (5,4), 13: (5,5), 14: (4,5) tail.\n> \n> After moving head to (6,4): new head at (6,4).\n> \n> Then, the body segments: segment 1 moves to previous position of head, (6,3).

Let's list snake positions in order:\n> \n> Index: 0: head (6,4)\n> \n> 1: (6,3)\n> \n> 2: (6,2)\n> \n> 3: (6,1)\n> \n> 4: (5,1)\n> \n> 5: (4,1)\n> \n> 6: (4,2)\n> \n> 7: (3,2)\n> \n> 8: (2,2)\n> \n> 9: (2,3)\n> \n> 10: (3,3)\n> \n> 11: (4,3)\n> \n> 12: (5,3)  <--- here\n> \n> 13: (5,4)\n> \n> 14: (5,5) tail\n> \n> So (5,3) is a body segment, and food is at (5,3) with value 1 and life span 9.\n> \n> But the rules say: food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if the body moves away and the head moves onto it.\n> \n> So for food at (5,3), since it's under the body, we need to move the body away so that the cell is free, then move the head there to eat it.\n> \n> Currently, at turn 74, the snake is at (5,3), so the food is under it but not accessible yet.\n> \n> Similarly, other food is on free cells, I assume.\n> \n> (2,6), (3,4), (6,6) are not in snake positions, so they are on free cells.\n> \n> (5,3) is occupied by snake body.\n> \n> Now, head is at (6,4), direction U (up).\n> \n> Possible moves: Since direction is U, we can move U, L, R, but not D because no instant reverse. Reverse of U is D, so cannot move down.\n> \n> So possible actions: U (up, y+1), L (left, x-1), R (right, x+1)\n> \n> Now, check each:\n> \n> - U: to (6,5)\n> \n> - L: to (5,4)\n> \n> - R: to (7,4) but x=7 is wall, so invalid. Cannot move right.\n> \n> x=7 is wall, so (7,4) is out of bounds.\n> \n> Similarly, L to (5,4): (5,4) is currently occupied by the snake body? Snake positions: (5,4) is the 13th segment, which is part of the body.\n> \n> But when we move, the snake moves, so after moving, the tail moves, so positions change.\n> \n> I need to think about the next state.\n> \n> First, let's list current free cells and food.\n> \n> Playable grid: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6.\n> \n> Obstacles: walls at borders, and internal: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4)\n> \n> (1,4) and (1,5) are both obstacles.\n> \n> Also, snake occupies: all positions from (6,4) to (5,5) as listed.\n> \n> So free cells: total cells: 6x6 = 36 cells.\n> \n> Snake length: 15 segments? Positions list has 15 elements, so snake length 15.\n> \n> Number of segments: from head to tail, 15 positions.\n> \n> Grid has 36 cells, obstacles: 5 internal, plus borders are walls, not cells, so cells blocked by obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,4), (1,5) — that's 5 cells.\n> \n> So free cells: 36 - 5 obstacles - 15 snake = 16 free cells.\n> \n> But food is placed on some, but not all free cells have food.\n> \n> Food at: (2,6), (3,4), (6,6), and (5,3) but (5,3) is occupied, so not free, but food is there under it.\n> \n> For movement, we care about accessible cells.\n> \n> Now, head at (6,4), direction U.\n> \n> Possible moves:\n> \n> - U: to (6,5). Is (6,5) valid? Not wall, not obstacle. Is it occupied? Snake body: positions include (5,5) which is (6,5)? No, (5,5) is x=5,y=5, not (6,5). (6,5) is not in snake positions; closest is (5,5) and (6,4), so (6,5) should be free? Let's list all snake positions: (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5)\n> \n> So (6,5) not listed, so free. Also, not obstacle. Wall at y=7, but (6,5) is y=5, ok. So U to (6,5) is possible.\n> \n> - L: to (5,4). (5,4) is in snake positions, it's the 13th segment. But when we move, if we move to (5,4), since the snake moves, the tail will move away from (5,5), but (5,4) is currently occupied, so if head moves to (5,4), it would collide with body, unless it's the tail.\n> \n> The rules: deadly collisions include body collision, but you can move into the cell occupied by the tail segment because the tail moves forward.\n> \n> Here, (5,4) is not the tail; tail is (5,5). (5,4) is the second last segment? Positions: index 12: (5,3), 13: (5,4), 14: (5,5) tail.\n> \n> So (5,4) is body, not tail. If head moves to (5,4), it would be moving to a body cell, which is not the tail, so collision, death.\n> \n> Therefore, moving left to (5,4) is invalid because it's occupied by body and not tail.\n> \n> Confirming: after move, head moves to new position, body follows, tail moves away.\n> \n> If head moves to a cell that was occupied by a body segment that is not the tail, it collides because that segment doesn't move away immediately; only the tail moves away when the head eats food or just moves.\n> \n> General rule: when snake moves:\n> \n> - If no food eaten, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, and tail leaves its cell.\n> \n> - If food eaten, head moves to new cell with food, new segment added at tail, so tail stays, but a new tail is formed.\n> \n> But for collision: head cannot move to a cell that is occupied by any body segment except when it is the tail cell and we are not eating food, but since we move to it, if it's tail, and no food, tail moves away, so it's ok.\n> \n> Specifically: if head moves to the tail cell, and there is no food there, then since tail moves away, the cell is vacated, so no collision.\n> \n> If head moves to the tail cell and there is food, then we eat it, grow, so tail doesn't move, and head collides with tail.\n> \n> Rules: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because head and newly grown tail collide.\n> \n> But in this case, for movement to (5,4), it's not the tail; tail is (5,5). So moving to (5,4) would collide with the body segment there.\n> \n> Therefore, L to (5,4) is invalid.\n> \n> R to (7,4): x=7 is wall, invalid.\n> \n> So only possible move is U to (6,5).\n> \n> Is that right? What about D? But direction is U, reverse is D, so cannot move down. No instant reverse, so D not allowed.\n> \n> So only U is possible? But that seems limited.\n> \n> Head at (6,4), direction U.\n> \n> Possible moves: U, L, R, but R to (7,4) wall, L to (5,4) body collision, so only U to (6,5) is valid.\n> \n> But (6,5) is free, so yes.\n> \n> After moving U, head to (6,5), then body follows: the segment that was at (6,4) moves to where head was? No.\n> \n> When head moves to new cell, the first body segment moves to the old head position, and so on, tail moves away.\n> \n> So from positions:\n> \n> Old: head (6,4), body1 (6,3), body2 (6,2), etc.\n> \n> After move U: head to (6,5), then body1 to old head (6,4), body2 to old body1 (6,3), and so on, down to tail (5,5) moves to old position of the segment before it, which was (5,4), so tail moves to (5,4)? Let's see the list.\n> \n> Positions: index 0: (6,4) head\n> \n> 1: (6,3)\n> \n> 2: (6,2)\n> \n> 3: (6,1)\n> \n> 4: (5,1)\n> \n> 5: (4,1)\n> \n> 6: (4,2)\n> \n> 7: (3,2)\n> \n> 8: (2,2)\n> \n> 9: (2,3)\n> \n> 10: (3,3)\n> \n> 11: (4,3)\n> \n> 12: (5,3)\n> \n> 13: (5,4)\n> \n> 14: (5,5) tail\n> \n> After move U to (6,5):\n> \n> New head: (6,5)\n> \n> Then body segments: segment 1 moves to old head (6,4)\n> \n> Segment 2 moves to old segment1 (6,3)\n> \n> Segment 3 moves to (6,2)\n> \n> Segment 4 moves to (6,1)\n> \n> Segment 5 moves to (5,1)\n> \n> Segment 6 moves to (4,1)\n> \n> Segment 7 moves to (4,2)\n> \n> Segment 8 moves to (3,2)\n> \n> Segment 9 moves to (2,2)\n> \n> Segment 10 moves to (2,3)? Old segment9 is (2,3), but segment10 was (3,3), which moves to old segment9 position (2,3)? Let's think indices.\n> \n> After head move, each body segment i moves to the position that segment i-1 had before the move.\n> \n> Standard snake movement.\n> \n> Before move:\n> \n> Positions: P0, P1, P2, ..., P14\n> \n> After move, if no food eaten:\n> \n> New positions: head at new position, then body: new P1 = old P0, new P2 = old P1, ..., new P14 = old P13\n> \n> Then tail is removed, so snake has same length.\n> \n> In this case, head moves to (6,5), so new head: (6,5)\n> \n> Then new body1: old head (6,4)\n> \n> new body2: old body1 (6,3)\n> \n> new body3: old body2 (6,2)\n> \n> new body4: old body3 (6,1)\n> \n> new body5: old body4 (5,1)\n> \n> new body6: old body5 (4,1)\n> \n> new body7: old body6 (4,2)\n> \n> new body8: old body7 (3,2)\n> \n> new body9: old body8 (2,2)\n> \n> new body10: old body9 (2,3)\n> \n> new body11: old body10 (3,3)\n> \n> new body12: old body11 (4,3)\n> \n> new body13: old body12 (5,3)\n> \n> new body14: old body13 (5,4)  // since old P13 is (5,4)\n> \n> Old P13 is (5,4), so new P14 = old P13 = (5,4)\n> \n> But old tail was P14 at (5,5), which is now gone, so the cell (5,5) is vacated.\n> \n> New tail is new P14 at (5,4)\n> \n> So snake now: head (6,5), body: (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4)\n> \n> Tail at (5,4)\n> \n> And (5,5) is now free.\n> \n> But back to turn 74, only possible move is U to (6,5).\n> \n> But is there no other move? What about moving left or right? L to (5,4) is invalid, R to (7,4) invalid, D not allowed. So yes, only U.\n> \n> But let's confirm the direction: head direction is U, so after moving U, new direction is U.\n> \n> Now, at turn 74, we must choose action. Only U is possible, so we move U to (6,5).\n> \n> But is there food at (6,5)? Food positions: (2,6), (3,4), (6,6), (5,3). No (6,5), so no food eaten. Snake length unchanged.\n> \n> Now, turn 75.\n> \n> Current turn is 74, action for turn 74 is U.\n> \n> Then turn 75, we need to think ahead.\n> \n> The question is to think 5+ turns ahead and provide a sequence of actions.\n> \n> First, for turn 74, only possible action is U, so we do that.\n> \n> Then state for turn 75.\n> \n> After turn 74 move:\n> \n> Head at (6,5), direction U (since we moved U).\n> \n> Food: life spans decrease.\n> \n> At turn 74, food:\n> \n> - (2,6): life span 1, so after turn 74, if not eaten, it disappears. Since we didn't eat it, it should be gone.\n> \n> Life span decreases every turn, including current.\n> \n> At turn 74, for (2,6), life span 1: if not eaten on turn 74, it disappears after this turn, so for turn 75, it's gone.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,4): life span 3 at turn 74, so after turn 74, life span 2; after turn 75, life span 1; after turn 76, gone.\n> \n> (6,6): life span 6, decreases each turn.\n> \n> (5,3): life span 9, decreases.\n> \n> But (5,3) is still under snake body? After move, new positions: head (6,5), body includes (5,3) at new body12 position? New body12 is (5,3), yes.\n> \n> Food at (5,3) is still there, under the body.\n> \n> Now turn 75: head at (6,5), direction U.\n> \n> Possible moves: U, L, R (not D, reverse not allowed).\n> \n> - U to (6,6): (6,6) is food? Yes, food at (6,6) with value 1, life span was 6 at turn 74, now at turn 75, life span 5? Let's track life spans.\n> \n> At start of turn 74:\n> \n> Food:\n> \n> - (2,6): life span 1\n> \n> - (3,4): life span 3\n> \n> - (6,6): life span 6\n> \n> - (5,3): life span 9\n> \n> After turn 74, no food eaten, so all life spans decrease by 1? Countdown decreases every turn.\n> \n> So after turn 74 (current turn), for food not eaten, life span decreases.\n> \n> So at start of turn 75:\n> \n> - (2,6): was life span 1, decreased, so disappeared (since after N turns, N=1, gone)\n> \n> - (3,4): was life span 3, now life span 2\n> \n> - (6,6): was life span 6, now life span 5\n> \n> - (5,3): was life span 9, now life span 8\n> \n> And (5,3) is still occupied by body.\n> \n> Now head at (6,5), direction U.\n> \n> Possible moves:\n> \n> - U to (6,6): (6,6) is not wall, not obstacle, and not occupied? After turn 74 move, snake positions: head (6,5), body (6,4), (6,3), etc., (5,3), (5,4) tail. (6,6) not in positions, so free. Food at (6,6), so moving U to (6,6) would eat the food, since it's there.\n> \n> Value +1, so snake grows.\n> \n> - L to (5,5): (5,5) is now free? After turn 74 move, (5,5) was vacated, so free. Not obstacle, not wall. Is there food? No food at (5,5), so moving there no food eaten.\n> \n> - R to (7,5): x=7 wall, invalid.\n> \n> So possible actions: U or L.\n> \n> U eats food, L no.\n> \n> Now, we need to think ahead.\n> \n> But let's list all options.\n> \n> First, for turn 74, only U possible, so action turn 74: U\n> \n> Then turn 75: we can choose U or L.\n> \n> If we go U, eat food at (6,6), grow to length 16.\n> \n> Then head at (6,6), direction U.\n> \n> After eating, new tail added, so positions: head at (6,6), then body: old head (6,5), old body1 (6,4), ..., up to old tail (5,4), and new tail at old tail position? When eat food, head moves to food cell, new segment added at tail, so tail doesn't move.\n> \n> Before move: positions P0 to P14.\n> \n> After move to food: new head at food cell, new body1 = old P0, new body2 = old P1, ..., new body15 = old P14, and new body16 = old P14? No.\n> \n> Standard: after eating, head moves to new cell (food), each body segment moves to previous position, and since food eaten, a new segment is added at the previous tail position, so tail stays.\n> \n> So new positions: head at new position, new body1 at old head, new body2 at old body1, ..., new body15 at old body14, and new body16 at old body14? Let's index.\n> \n> Before move: segments 0 to 14 (15 segments)\n> \n> After move and eat: head at new cell, segment 1 at old segment 0, segment 2 at old segment 1, ..., segment 15 at old segment 14, and a new segment 16 at old segment 14 position? No.\n> \n> Positions: the new head is at the new position.\n> \n> Then the first body segment is at the old head position.\n> \n> Second body segment at the old first body position, and so on, up to the last body segment at the old second last body position, and the new tail is at the old tail position, since it grows.\n> \n> So number of segments increases by one.\n> \n> In this case, before move to (6,6), positions: P0: (6,5), P1: (6,4), P2: (6,3), P3: (6,2), P4: (6,1), P5: (5,1), P6: (4,1), P7: (4,2), P8: (3,2), P9: (2,2), P10: (2,3), P11: (3,3), P12: (4,3), P13: (5,3), P14: (5,4)  // tail\n> \n> Move head to (6,6) and eat food.\n> \n> New positions: head at (6,6)\n> \n> Body1 at old P0: (6,5)\n> \n> Body2 at old P1: (6,4)\n> \n> Body3 at old P2: (6,3)\n> \n> ...\n> Body15 at old P14: (5,4)  // which was old tail\n> \n> And new body16 at old P14 position: (5,4)? No, the new segment is added at the position where the tail was, but since the tail moved?

But it says \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn including current\".\n> \n> I think it's better to interpret: at the start of turn t, food has life_span L. After the turn, if not eaten, life_span decreases by 1. When life_span reaches 0, it disappears before the next turn.\n> \n> The rule: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" – but it doesn't specify when it decreases. Probably, at the end of the turn, life_span decreases.\n> \n> Similarly, for eating: when the head moves onto a food cell during a turn, it is eaten.\n> \n> To avoid confusion, let's assume:\n> \n> - At the beginning of turn t, food has life_span L.\n> - During turn t, if head moves to food, it is eaten.\n> - At the end of turn t, if food not eaten, life_span decreases by 1. If life_span becomes 0, food disappears.\n> \n> So for food at (3,4): life_span 3 at turn 75. So:\n> - Turn 75: life_span 3\n> - After turn 75, if not eaten, life_span becomes 2\n> - After turn 76, if not eaten, life_span becomes 1\n> - After turn 77, if not eaten, life_span becomes 0, disappears before turn 78.\n> \n> Similarly for others:\n> - (6,6): life_span 5, so disappears after turn 79 if not eaten (since turn 75:5, 76:4, 77:3, 78:2, 79:1, after 79:0 gone)\n> - (5,3): life_span 8, disappears after turn 82 if not eaten.\n> \n> Now, food at (5,3) is currently under the snake's body segment. Specifically, (5,3) is occupied by the snake at position index 13. So to eat it, the body must move away first, then head can move onto it later.\n> \n> Also, head direction is U, so from (6,5), moving up would go to (6,6).\n> \n> Possible moves from current position: head at (6,5), direction U, so I can move U, L, R, but not D because that would be instant reverse? Direction is U, so opposite is D, so I cannot move down on the next turn.\n> \n> Movement constraints: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\"\n> \n> Current direction is U, so next turn I cannot move D. I can move U, L, or R.\n> \n> Now, grid boundaries: walls at borders, so x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Also internal obstacles at (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4).\n> \n> (5,2) is a wall, which is occupied, so snake cannot go there.\n> \n> (4,4) wall, (1,2) wall, (1,5) wall, (1,4) wall.\n> \n> Now, let's list all wall cells:\n> \n> - Border: all x=0, x=7 for y in 0 to 7; all y=0, y=7 for x in 0 to 7. But since internal might overlap, but walls are separate.\n> \n> Internal obstacles are specific cells: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4). So these are like wall cells.\n> \n> Now, food: (3,4), (6,6), and (5,3) which is under body.\n> \n> (5,3) is food, but snake is on it, so not accessible until body moves.\n> \n> First, I need to plan moves for at least 5 turns ahead.\n> \n> Current head position: (6,5)\n> \n> Possible actions for turn 75: since direction U, can go U, L, R.\n> \n> - U: to (6,6) – which has food? (6,6) is a food position with value 1, life_span 5. Is it safe?\n> \n> (6,6) is within grid? x=6,y=6, grid is 0 to 7, so y=6 is not border? y=0 and y=7 are borders, so y=6 is ok. x=6, x=7 is border, but x=6 is not x=7, so (6,6) is not a wall cell.\n> \n> Now, is (6,6) occupied by snake? Snake positions: let's see, (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), etc., no (6,6), so it's empty except for food. Food is there, but food doesn't block, it can be eaten.\n> \n> If I move U to (6,6), I eat the food there, since head moves onto it. Value +1, snake length increases by 1.\n> \n> But I need to check for collisions after moving.\n> \n> After moving to (6,6), the new head position is (6,6), and the tail will move, but since I eat food, tail doesn't move, so the body extends.\n> \n> When snake eats food, it grows, so the tail doesn't move, new segment added at head.\n> \n> Current snake positions: 15 segments.\n> \n> If I eat food at (6,6), head moves to (6,6), and the body remains, so new position: head (6,6), then previous head (6,5) becomes part of body, so snake becomes: [(6,6), (6,5), (6,4), ..., up to (5,4)] with 16 segments.\n> \n> Now, is there collision? Head at (6,6), body at (6,5), (6,4), etc. (6,6) is not in the body except that (6,5) is adjacent, but since it's the neck, it's ok, not collision. Collision only if head touches body segments except the immediate next one, I think.\n> \n> The rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> In this case, after moving to (6,6), the head is at (6,6), and body includes (6,5), which is the previous head, so it's adjacent, not a collision. Other body segments are at (6,4), (6,3), etc., all below, so (6,6) is not occupied by any other body part, so safe.\n> \n> Also, walls: not a wall.\n> \n> But there's a special case: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n> \n> In this case, tail is at (5,4). Head at (6,5), if I move U to (6,6), head is at (6,6), tail at (5,4). Are they adjacent? (6,6) and (5,4) are not adjacent; adjacent means sharing side, so (6,6) and (5,4) differ by 1 in x and 2 in y, not adjacent. So no issue.\n> \n> Moreover, tail cell (5,4) does not have food; food is at (3,4), (6,6), (5,3). (5,4) is part of snake, no food.\n> \n> So moving U to eat (6,6) seems safe and beneficial.\n> \n> But I need to think long-term. Also, there is food at (3,4) with short life span, only 3 turns, so it might disappear soon.\n> \n> And food at (5,3) under body, which I might want later.\n> \n> First, let's list all possible moves for turn 75.\n> \n> From (6,5), direction U, can move:\n> \n> - U: to (6,6) - has food, eat it, grow to 16, head at (6,6), direction now U.\n> \n> - L: to (5,5) - what is there? (5,5) not in snake positions, not a wall? Walls: internal obstacles (5,2) is wall, but (5,5) is not listed, so should be free. Also not food. So safe move, no food, no growth.\n> \n> - R: to (7,5) - but x=7 is border wall, so cannot move there, collision with wall.\n> \n> x=7 is wall, so R to (7,5) is invalid, death.\n> \n> So possible actions: U or L.\n> \n> D is not allowed because opposite direction.\n> \n> Now, if I move L to (5,5), then head at (5,5), direction L (since I moved left? Current direction was U, but after moving L, the new direction is L for next move.\n> \n> The head direction changes based on the move.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan a sequence of at least 5 turns.\n> \n> Also, food at (3,4) has life_span 3, meaning at turn 75, it has 3 turns left; after turn 75, if not eaten, life_span 2, then after turn 76, life_span 1, after turn 77, gone. So must be eaten by turn 77 at latest, but since it decreases after turn, to eat it, I need to be on (3,4) during turn 75, 76, or 77.\n> \n> Similarly for others.\n> \n> (3,4) is at distance: from (6,5) to (3,4) is |6-3|=3 in x, |5-4|=1 in y, so Manhattan distance 4, so I need at least 4 moves to reach it, but I can move diagonally? No, only up, down, left, right, so Manhattan distance.\n> \n> From (6,5) to (3,4): need to go left 3 times and down 1 time, or other paths, but down might not be possible.\n> \n> y: from 5 to 4, so down in y, but since y increases up? In coordinates, U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), so y decreases down.\n> \n> Standard grid: (0,0) bottom-left or top-left? Not specified, but in snake, usually (0,0) is bottom-left or top-left? Movement: U (x,y+1), so y increases up, so (0,0) is bottom-left, I assume.\n> \n> In positions, snake at (6,5), moving U to (6,6), so y=6 is above y=5.\n> \n> (3,4) has y=4, which is below y=5, so to go to (3,4), I need to decrease y by 1 and x by 3.\n> \n> But from (6,5), I can only move U, L, R this turn.\n> \n> If I move L to (5,5), then I'm closer in x, but y same.\n> \n> Then from there, I could move L again or D, etc.\n> \n> But (3,4) has short life, only 3 turns including current, so if I don't eat it by turn 77, it's gone.\n> \n> Turn 75: if I don't eat (3,4) this turn, it has until turn 77.\n> \n> But I'm at (6,5), far away, Manhattan distance |6-3| + |5-4| = 3 + 1 = 4, so I need 4 moves to reach (3,4). But turns: on turn 75, I move to a new position, which could be closer.\n> \n> After turn 75 move, I can be at (6,6) or (5,5).\n> \n> If I go to (6,6), distance to (3,4): |6-3| + |6-4| = 3 + 2 = 5, farther.\n> \n> If I go to (5,5), distance |5-3| + |5-4| = 2 + 1 = 3, closer.\n> \n> Then on turn 76, from (5,5), I can move to (4,5) or (5,4) or (5,6) or (6,5), but (6,5) is body, etc.\n> \n> But (3,4) must be eaten by turn 77.\n> \n> If I start moving towards it, I can reach by turn 77 or earlier.\n> \n> For example, from (5,5) on turn 76, I can move L to (4,5), then on turn 77 move D to (4,4), but (4,4) is a wall! Internal obstacle (4,4) is wall, so cannot go there.\n> \n> (4,4) is wall, so I cannot move to (4,4).\n> \n> From (4,5), to reach (3,4), I need to go left to (3,5) then down to (3,4), or down to (4,4) but wall, so only left to (3,5) then down.\n> \n> (3,5) is not wall, I think.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), (4,4), (5,2). (3,5) not listed, so free.\n> \n> Similarly, borders x=0,7 y=0,7.\n> \n> So from (5,5), on turn 76, move L to (4,5) — is (4,5) safe? Not wall, not snake? Snake positions: current snake has (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), but (4,5) not occupied, so ok.\n> \n> Then turn 77, from (4,5), move L to (3,5), then turn 78 move D to (3,4). But (3,4) food might be gone by then.\n> \n> Life_span: at turn 75, food at (3,4) has life_span 3.\n> \n> - After turn 75, if not eaten, life_span=2\n> - After turn 76, life_span=1\n> - After turn 77, life_span=0, disappears before turn 78.\n> \n> So to eat it, I must be on (3,4) during turn 75, 76, or 77.\n> \n> On turn 77, if I move to (3,4), I can eat it.\n> \n> From above, if I move to (3,5) on turn 77, then on turn 77 I can move down to (3,4) to eat it.\n> \n> On turn 77, I can be at (3,4) during that turn.\n> \n> Similarly, if I can get there earlier.\n> \n> But from current, if I go directly, but I can only move one step per turn.\n> \n> Now back to immediate choice.\n> \n> If I move U to (6,6) on turn 75, I eat that food, grow to 16, head at (6,6).\n> \n> Then I can consider going to (3,4) later, but it might be too late.\n> \n> From (6,6) to (3,4), distance |6-3| + |6-4| = 3+2=5, so at least 5 moves, but by turn 78, food is gone.\n> \n> Turn 75: I move to (6,6)\n> \n> Turn 76: from (6,6), I can move L to (5,6), or D to (6,5), but (6,5) is body?

Not snake? Snake positions after move: head (6,6), body (6,5), (6,4), etc., no (5,6), so free.\n> \n> R to (7,6), x=7 wall, death.\n> \n> So only L to (5,6) possible from (6,6).\n> \n> Then to reach (3,4), it's far, and food disappears after turn 77, so by turn 78 it's gone. Turn 76 I can be at (5,6), turn 77 at (5,5) or (4,6), etc., not close to (3,4). |5-3| + |6-4| = 2+2=4 from (5,6), need 4 moves, but turn 77 I can move to say (4,6), turn 78 to (3,6) or (4,5), then to (3,5), then (3,4), but on turn 78, food is already gone, since after turn 77 it disappears.\n> \n> After turn 77, life_span=0, gone before turn 78.\n> \n> So last chance to eat is on turn 77.\n> \n> On turn 77, I must be at (3,4).\n> \n> From turn 75, if I go to (6,6), on turn 76 I can only go to (5,6), then on turn 77, from (5,6) I can go to (5,5), (4,6), or (5,7) but y=7 wall, or (6,6) body. So to (5,5) or (4,6). Neither is (3,4). From (5,5) to (3,4) is |5-3| + |5-4| =2+1=3 moves away, cannot reach in one move. Similarly (4,6) to (3,4) |4-3| + |6-4|=1+2=3 moves. So impossible to reach (3,4) by turn 77 if I go to (6,6) on turn 75.\n> \n> Therefore, if I want to eat (3,4), I must not go to (6,6) now; instead, I should move towards (3,4).\n> \n> So for turn 75, moving L to (5,5) is better to get closer to (3,4).\n> \n> Then from (5,5), on turn 76, I can move L to (4,5), as I thought.\n> \n> Then from (4,5), on turn 77, I can move L to (3,5), and then on turn 77, I can move down to (3,4) to eat it.\n> \n> On turn 77, from (3,5), move D to (3,4).\n> \n> Now, is (3,4) safe?

It's turn 77, and the grid has walls and obstacles. The borders are from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid. Internal obstacles are at (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), and (1,4). I should plot this mentally.\n> \n> Snake positions: Head is at (5,6), and the body goes through (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4). That's 17 segments. Let me list them in order:\n> \n> - Head: (5,6)\n> \n> - Then: (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4) – that's 16 after head, so total 17 segments. Positions are given from head to tail, so (5,6) is head, and (5,4) is tail.\n> \n> Snake head direction is L, which means left. So the snake was moving left to reach (5,6) from previous position. Since it came to (5,6) from the right, because previous head was (6,6) I think? Snake positions: [(5,6), (6,6), ...] so from (6,6) to (5,6), it moved left, so current direction is L, which matches.\n> \n> Food:\n> \n> - (3,4) with value 1 and life span 1\n> \n> - (5,3) with value 1 and life span 6\n> \n> Both are positive food since value is +1. Life span: (3,4) disappears after this turn if not eaten, since life span 1 decreases each turn including current, so after turn 77, it will be gone if not eaten now. (5,3) has life span 6, so it has 6 turns including this one to be eaten.\n> \n> Now, (5,3) is occupied by the snake's body? Snake positions include (5,3), which is the 16th segment? Let's index: positions list, head is index 0: (5,6), then 1:(6,6), 2:(6,5), 3:(6,4), 4:(6,3), 5:(6,2), 6:(6,1), 7:(5,1), 8:(4,1), 9:(4,2), 10:(3,2), 11:(2,2), 12:(2,3), 13:(3,3), 14:(4,3), 15:(5,3), 16:(5,4). So (5,3) is position 15, which is a body segment, not the tail. Tail is (5,4).\n> \n> Food at (5,3) is on a body segment. According to rules, food can spawn under body but can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves onto it. So for (5,3), since it's occupied by body, I can't eat it now; I need to move the snake so that the body leaves (5,3), then head can move there to eat it.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,4) is free, I think? Let me see if any snake is there. Positions: (3,4) not listed, so it's empty or has food. Food is at (3,4) and (5,3), so (3,4) should be free.\n> \n> Walls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4).\n> \n> (4,4) is an obstacle, and (5,2) is obstacle, etc.\n> \n> Now, head at (5,6), direction L. So from (5,6), possible moves: since direction is L, I can move L, U, D, but not R because that would be reverse, and no instant reverse rule. Current direction L, so I can move L (continue left), U (up), D (down), but not R (right, opposite).\n> \n> Now, adjacent cells:\n> \n> - Left: (4,6) – is this valid? x=4, y=6. Walls: borders are x=0 and x=7, so x=4 is within 1 to 6? Grid is x=0 to 7, but walls at x=0 and x=7, so cells from x=1 to x=6 are free? Similarly y=1 to y=6? No.\n> \n> Cells occupied by walls: border cells x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So for movement, I cannot move to x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Internal obstacles also block movement.\n> \n> So for (5,6):\n> \n> - Left: (4,6) – x=4, y=6. Is this a wall? x=4 not 0 or 7, y=6 not 0 or 7, and not in internal obstacles: obstacles are (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4). (4,6) not listed, so should be free. But is it occupied by snake? Snake positions: head (5,6), body (6,6), (6,5), etc. (4,6) not in positions, so empty.\n> \n> - Up: (5,7) – y=7 is border wall, so cannot move up.\n> \n> - Down: (5,5) – y=5, x=5. Not wall, not obstacle? Obstacles: (5,2) is at y=2, (4,4) at y=4, etc. (5,5) not listed, so free? Snake: positions have (6,5), (5,4), etc., not (5,5), so empty.\n> \n> - Right: (6,6) – but (6,6) is the first body segment, and since direction is L, moving right would be reverse, which is not allowed. Also, (6,6) is occupied, so I can't move there anyway.\n> \n> Possible moves from (5,6): L to (4,6), D to (5,5), U is invalid because y=7 wall.\n> \n> Now, food: (3,4) with life span 1, so must be eaten this turn or lost. But head is at (5,6), (3,4) is at distance. How to get there? (3,4) is two left and two down from (5,6)? From (5,6) to (3,4): delta x = -2, delta y = -2, so not adjacent. I can't reach it in one move. Life span is 1, and this is turn 77, so after this turn, it disappears. So I cannot eat it this turn; it will be gone after. So (3,4) is not accessible for eating now.\n> \n> Confirm: food at (3,4) with life span 1. Life span decreases every turn including current, so at the start of turn 77, life span is 1. If I move to (3,4) this turn, I eat it. But head is at (5,6), which is not adjacent to (3,4). Distance: |5-3|=2, |6-4|=2, so at least two moves away. Since I can only move one cell per turn, I cannot reach it this turn. Therefore, (3,4) will disappear after this turn without being eaten. So I should ignore it; it's not a viable target.\n> \n> Now, other food: (5,3) with value 1, life span 6. It's currently under the snake body at position (5,3), which is segment 15. To eat it, I need to move the snake so that the body leaves (5,3), and then head moves to (5,3). Since life span is 6, I have up to 6 turns to eat it, including this one.\n> \n> But I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n> \n> First, let's consider the current possible moves.\n> \n> From head (5,6), direction L.\n> \n> Possible actions:\n> \n> - L to (4,6)\n> \n> - D to (5,5)\n> \n> - U: invalid, wall\n> \n> - R: invalid, reverse and occupied.\n> \n> So only L or D.\n> \n> Now, let's see what happens with each move.\n> \n> If I move L to (4,6): new head position (4,6), direction now L (since I moved left). Snake body: the tail end will move forward, so the last segment (5,4) will be removed, and new head added. After move, positions: head at (4,6), then body: (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4) but (5,4) is tail, so when head moves to (4,6), the tail (5,4) is removed? Snake movement: when moving, head goes to new position, and tail is removed unless food eaten.\n> \n> No food eaten in this move, so length same, tail removed.\n> \n> Current positions: 17 segments. After move left to (4,6), new positions: head (4,6), then previous head (5,6) becomes segment 1, (6,6) segment 2, ..., up to (5,3) segment 16, and (5,4) was segment 17, tail. Since no food, tail is removed, so new body from index 1 to 16: (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3). So 16 segments, tail at (5,3).\n> \n> (5,3) is now the tail? Positions: head (4,6), then (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), ..., (4,3), (5,3). (5,3) is the last segment, tail.\n> \n> But food is at (5,3), which is now the tail position.\n> \n> If I move to (4,6), the tail becomes (5,3), which has food on it? But I didn't eat it; the food is there, but since the snake body is on it, and I moved, the food is still there under the tail.\n> \n> According to rules, food can be eaten only when head moves onto it, not when body is on it. So with tail at (5,3), if I later move head to (5,3), I can eat it, but need to be careful of tail reward danger.\n> \n> If I move D to (5,5): from (5,6) down to (5,5). New head (5,5), direction D. Then positions: head (5,5), then (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), etc., up to (5,3), (5,4) but (5,4) tail removed, so new tail is (5,3).\n> \n> Similar, (5,3) becomes tail.\n> \n> In both cases, after one move, (5,3) becomes the tail segment because the current tail (5,4) is removed.\n> \n> Current tail is (5,4). After move, whether I go to (4,6) or (5,5), the new tail is the segment that was second last, which is (5,3), since positions: ... (4,3), (5,3), (5,4). After head moves, (5,4) is removed, so (5,3) is new tail.\n> \n> And food at (5,3) is now under the tail.\n> \n> To eat the food at (5,3), I need to move the head to (5,3) when it's free, but since it's under tail, I need the tail to move away first.\n> \n> Specifically, I need to move so that the tail leaves (5,3), then head moves to it.\n> \n> Since (5,3) is the tail now, after the first move, when I move again, the tail will move to the next position.\n> \n> I should think multiple turns ahead.\n> \n> First, let's consider the grid layout to avoid collisions.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4)\n> \n> Snake positions after first move.\n> \n> Also, I need to maximize score, but only one food available, (5,3), since (3,4) is gone after this turn.\n> \n> (3,4) life span 1, not eaten this turn, so gone.\n> \n> Food at (5,3) life span 6, so I have 6 turns to eat it.\n> \n> But I should also think about survival and future food, but no other food mentioned, so probably only this one for now.\n> \n> The state only lists current food, so I have to work with that.\n> \n> Now, let's plan how to eat (5,3).\n> \n> Currently, after any first move, (5,3) becomes tail.\n> \n> Then, to eat it, I need to move the head to (5,3) after the tail has moved away.\n> \n> Since the tail is at (5,3), when the snake moves, the tail will leave (5,3) only if the snake moves in a way that the tail position changes.\n> \n> For example, if I move the head, the tail moves to the previous position of the second last segment.\n> \n> Let's simulate.\n> \n> After first move to (4,6) or (5,5), new tail at (5,3).\n> \n> Now, suppose I want to eat at (5,3). I need to have head move to (5,3) when it is empty.\n> \n> But (5,3) is occupied by tail now. So I must move such that on some turn, the tail leaves (5,3), and then on the next turn or later, head moves to (5,3).\n> \n> But when the tail leaves (5,3), it becomes empty, and food is still there if life span >0.\n> \n> Then head can move to it to eat.\n> \n> But there's a danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> \"Tail Reward Danger\": If head is adjacent to the tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills.\n> \n> In this case, when I move head to (5,3) after tail leaves, I need to ensure that head is not adjacent to the new tail when I eat.\n> \n> Let's think carefully.\n> \n> First, after initial move, say to (4,6), positions: head (4,6), body: (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3) tail.\n> \n> Food at (5,3) under tail.\n> \n> Now, turn 78, I need to move from (4,6).

When I move the snake, the tail will move to where the second last segment was, which is (4,3) in this case? Positions: head (4,6), then (5,6), ..., (4,3), (5,3) tail. So second last is (4,3), so when I move, tail moves to (4,3)? No.\n> \n> Snake movement: head moves to new position, each segment moves to the position of the previous one, so tail is removed from (5,3), and new tail is the segment that was at (4,3), which moves to... let's think.\n> \n> After head moves to new position, say to (3,6) or (4,5), then the segment that was at (5,6) moves to (4,6), which was head position, but head moved, so (5,6) becomes new position 1, at (5,6)? I'm confusing myself.\n> \n> Better to think of the positions shifting.\n> \n> Current positions turn 77 after move to (4,6): let's call turn 78 state.\n> \n> At start of turn 78, positions: head (4,6), body segments: seg1: (5,6), seg2: (6,6), seg3: (6,5), seg4: (6,4), seg5: (6,3), seg6: (6,2), seg7: (6,1), seg8: (5,1), seg9: (4,1), seg10: (4,2), seg11: (3,2), seg12: (2,2), seg13: (2,3), seg14: (3,3), seg15: (4,3), seg16: (5,3) tail.\n> \n> Food at (5,3) under tail.\n> \n> Now, on turn 78, I move head to some direction.\n> \n> Suppose I move down to (4,5).

Snake positions: head (5,5), then (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4),... (6,5) is the fourth segment. Since the snake moves, when head moves to a new cell, the tail moves away, so moving to (6,5) might be okay if it's the tail, but let's see.\n> \n> (6,5) is currently occupied by a body segment.

Are they adjacent? (5,5) and (5,3) are two cells apart vertically? y=5 and y=3, difference of 2, not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing an edge, so up, down, left, right.

The head direction is down (D), which means the snake was moving downward to reach (5,4).\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - At (5,3) with value 1 and life span 5. Since life span decreases every turn, including current, and it's turn 79, this food will disappear after 5 more turns? Life span is given as 5, so it has 5 turns left, meaning it will disappear after turn 83 (since current turn is 79, it decreases on turn 80,81,82,83, gone after 83? Let's clarify: \"life-span disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So for food at (5,3) with life_span=5 on turn 79, after turn 79, life_span becomes 4, and so on, until it reaches 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten until turn 83 (when life_span=1 on turn 83, decreases to 0 after eaten or after turn). But since it can be eaten as long as life_span >0, I think it can be eaten on turns 79 to 83, disappearing after turn 83.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (6,3) with value 1 and life_span=10, so it has many turns left.\n> \n> Both foods have value +1, so positive food.\n> \n> Now, the head is at (5,4), moving down. From the positions, the head is at (5,4), and before that it was at (5,5) since positions are head first, so from (5,5) to (5,4) is down, which matches head direction D.\n> \n> Possible moves: I can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R), but I cannot move opposite to current direction immediately. Current direction is D, so I cannot move up (U) on the next turn because that would be reverse.\n> \n> No instant reverse: cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn. So since head direction is D, I cannot move U on turn 80.\n> \n> So for turn 80, possible moves: D, L, or R. Not U.\n> \n> Now, let's see the grid layout to understand where I can move.\n> \n> First, let's sketch the grid. x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7, but walls at borders, so x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4)\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (5,4), body at: (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3)\n> \n> List the snake cells:\n> \n> - (5,4) head\n> \n> - (5,5)\n> \n> - (5,6)\n> \n> - (6,6)\n> \n> - (6,5)\n> \n> - (6,4) — this is the same as head?

Positions are head first, so the last element is the tail end. So tail is at (4,3).\n> \n> Now, food at (5,3) and (6,3).\n> \n> (6,3) is a body segment? From the list, (6,3) is part of the snake body, at position index 6? Let's index: index 0: (5,4) head, 1: (5,5), 2: (5,6), 3: (6,6), 4: (6,5), 5: (6,4), 6: (6,3), 7: (6,2), 8: (6,1), 9: (5,1), 10: (4,1), 11: (4,2), 12: (3,2), 13: (2,2), 14: (2,3), 15: (3,3), 16: (4,3) tail.\n> \n> So (6,3) is occupied by the snake body at index 6. But there is food at (6,3) with value 1 and life span 10.\n> \n> Special case: food can spawn under snake body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves onto it.\n> \n> Here, (6,3) has food, but it's currently occupied by the snake body. So to eat it, the body needs to move away from (6,3), and then head moves to it.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (5,3), which is not occupied by snake? Let's see the positions: (5,3) is not in the snake positions list. Snake has (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), but not (5,3). So (5,3) is free, I think, except for possible walls or obstacles.\n> \n> Walls: borders and internal obstacles. (5,3) is x=5,y=3, which is not a border (borders are x=0,7 or y=0,7), and not in internal obstacles: internal are (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4). (5,3) is not listed, so it should be free.\n> \n> But (5,3) has food with life span 5.\n> \n> (6,3) has food but is occupied by snake body.\n> \n> Now, head is at (5,4), direction D.\n> \n> For turn 80, I need to choose action: U, D, L, R, but not U since reverse not allowed.\n> \n> Possible moves from (5,4):\n> \n> - Up (U): to (5,5) — but (5,5) is occupied by snake body, so moving there would cause collision, death.\n> \n> - Down (D): to (5,3) — (5,3) has food and is free? Is it free? Snake positions: (5,3) not listed, walls not there, so yes, (5,3) is empty except for the food, which is fine, moving to food is eating.\n> \n> - Left (L): to (4,4) — but (4,4) is an internal obstacle? Internal obstacles include (4,4)? Yes, from the list: (4,4) is an internal obstacle, so wall, cannot move there.\n> \n> - Right (R): to (6,4) — (6,4) is occupied by snake body at index 5, so moving there would collide with body.\n> \n> Let's confirm:\n> \n> - U: (5,5) - snake body, collision\n> \n> - D: (5,3) - free, has food\n> \n> - L: (4,4) - obstacle, wall\n> \n> - R: (6,4) - snake body, collision\n> \n> So the only possible move is down to (5,3), which has positive food.\n> \n> Is that right? (5,3) is not wall, not snake body, and has food.\n> \n> But let's check if moving to (5,3) is safe.\n> \n> After moving to (5,3), the snake will grow because it's positive food, so length increases by one.\n> \n> Current length: 17 segments? Positions have 17 elements, so length 17.\n> \n> After eating, new head at (5,3), and tail doesn't move? When snake eats, the head moves to food, and a new segment is added, so tail stays, body moves.\n> \n> Standard snake: when you eat, head moves to food, new segment is added where tail was or something? No.\n> \n> In this game, when snake eats positive food, length increases by one, so after moving, the tail doesn't move, effectively growing.\n> \n> But in terms of positions: if head moves to new cell, and if it eats food, the body doesn't advance, so the tail stays, and new head position is added.\n> \n> For example, from current, head at (5,4), move to (5,3), which has food, so new positions: head is now (5,3), and the previous head (5,4) becomes body, and since food eaten, the tail doesn't move, so the last segment (tail) remains, so positions become: [(5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3)] — length 18 now.\n> \n> (4,3) is tail, remains.\n> \n> But (6,3) is still occupied, and it has food, but now it's not eaten yet.\n> \n> Now, for turn 80, if I move D to (5,3), I eat the food, good.\n> \n> But is there any risk?\n> \n> Tail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> In this case, after moving to (5,3), where is the tail? Tail is at (4,3).\n> \n> (4,3) and (5,3) are adjacent? (4,3) and (5,3) are left-right, so adjacent horizontally.\n> \n> Now, does the tail cell have positive food? The tail is at (4,3), but is there food at (4,3)? From the food positions, only (5,3) and (6,3) have food, not (4,3). So no food at tail.\n> \n> Therefore, no issue.\n> \n> So moving D to (5,3) seems safe and I eat the food.\n> \n> But I need to think ahead 5+ turns.\n> \n> Also, there's food at (6,3) under the body, which I might want to eat later.\n> \n> But let's see the action for turn 80.\n> \n> Possible moves are only D, since U, L, R are all blocked or deadly.\n> \n> L to (4,4) is wall, R to (6,4) is body, U to (5,5) is body, so yes, only D is possible.\n> \n> So for turn 80, I must move D to (5,3).\n> \n> But turn 80 is the next turn, current turn is 79, so action for turn 80.\n> \n> The state is at turn 79, so I need to give actions starting from turn 80.\n> \n> Answer format: Turn t1: action on turn t1, but t1 is 79?

Perhaps the direction is the current facing, but I need to choose the next move.\n> \n> The state says \"Snake Head Direction: D\", which I think means the snake was moving down to reach (5,3), so the head is at (5,3) and it came from above? Positions: from the list, previous head was probably at (5,4) or something? Let's see the positions: head is (5,3), and next is (5,4), which is above, so if head is at (5,3) and the next body segment is (5,4), which is north, so the snake was moving south (down) to get to (5,3). So current direction is down, meaning it just moved down to (5,3).\n> \n> Now, for the next move, I need to choose a direction: U, D, L, R.\n> \n> But moving down to (5,2) is invalid because (5,2) is a wall.\n> \n> Similarly, moving left: (4,3) is occupied by the tail? (4,3) is part of the body, but it's the tail segment. According to the rules, I can move into the tail cell because the tail will move away, but only if it's the very end tail.\n> \n> Let's clarify the collision rules.\n> \n> From the core rules: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment).

The cell (4,3) is currently occupied by the tail, but if I move left to (4,3), it should be okay because the tail will move away when the snake advances.\n> \n> Similarly, other cells.\n> \n> Now, available moves from (5,3):\n> \n> - Up: to (5,4) – but (5,4) is occupied by the body (index 1), so if I move up, head would go to (5,4) which is a body segment, and since it's not the tail, it would collide. After moving, the head moves first, then the body follows. When I move, the head moves to a new cell, then each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment before it. So the tail end is left.\n> \n> Specifically: if I move the head to a new position, the segment that was at position 1 moves to where the head was, and so on, down to the tail.\n> \n> So, if I move up to (5,4), which is currently occupied by the first body segment. After the move, the head would be at (5,4), and that body segment would move to (5,3), but since the head is now at (5,4), and it's colliding with itself? At the moment of move, if the head moves to a cell occupied by a body segment, it collides, except if it's the tail cell and it's moving away.\n> \n> The rule says: \"head touches any body segment\" is deadly, but with exception for tail.\n> \n> \"Body collision (head touches any body segment).

So collision.\n> \n> Moving left to (4,3): (4,3) is the tail segment. Since it's the tail, moving to it should be safe because after the move, the tail will move away.\n> \n> Confirming: if I move left to (4,3), head goes to (4,3), which was the tail position.

No.\n> \n> The snake moves: the head moves to a new cell, then each body segment from front to back moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> So after moving head to (4,3):\n> \n> - Head new position: (4,3)\n> \n> - Segment 1 (was at (5,4)) moves to where head was: (5,3)\n> \n> - Segment 2 (was at (5,5)) moves to where segment 1 was: (5,4)\n> \n> - Segment 3 (was at (5,6)) moves to (5,5)\n> \n> - Segment 4 (was at (6,6)) moves to (5,6)\n> \n> - Segment 5 (was at (6,5)) moves to (6,6)\n> \n> - Segment 6 (was at (6,4)) moves to (6,5)\n> \n> - Segment 7 (was at (6,3)) moves to (6,4)\n> \n> - Segment 8 (was at (6,2)) moves to (6,3)\n> \n> - Segment 9 (was at (6,1)) moves to (6,2)\n> \n> - Segment 10 (was at (5,1)) moves to (6,1)\n> \n> - Segment 11 (was at (4,1)) moves to (5,1)\n> \n> - Segment 12 (was at (4,2)) moves to (4,1)\n> \n> - Segment 13 (was at (3,2)) moves to (4,2)\n> \n> - Segment 14 (was at (2,2)) moves to (3,2)\n> \n> - Segment 15 (was at (2,3)) moves to (2,2)\n> \n> - Segment 16 (was at (3,3)) moves to (2,3)\n> \n> - Segment 17 (was at (4,3)) - but head moved here, so this segment is removed? No, since no food eaten, the snake doesn't grow, so the tail segment is not added; it moves forward.\n> \n> Since no food, the last segment, which was at (4,3), is not occupied anymore; the tail is now where segment 16 was, which is (3,3) moving to (2,3) or something.\n> \n> After movement:\n> \n> - Head: (4,3)\n> \n> - Body: segment 1: (5,3)  // moved from (5,4) to (5,3)\n> \n> Segment 2: (5,4)  // from (5,5) to (5,4)\n> \n> Segment 3: (5,5)  // from (5,6) to (5,5)\n> \n> Segment 4: (5,6)  // from (6,6) to (5,6)? No:\n> \n> Segment 4 was at (6,6), moves to where segment 3 was: (5,6)? Segment 3 was at (5,6), but segment 3 moves to where segment 2 was, which is (5,5)?

So on turn 81, life span is 8, meaning it has 8 turns left, including this turn. After turn 81, it will have 7 left, and so on, until turn 88 it has 1 left, and on turn 89 it disappears. So I need to eat it by turn 88.\n> \n> Now, snake head is at (4,3), moving left. Possible moves: since it's moving left, I can go left (L), up (U), or down (D), but not right (R) because that's the opposite direction, and no instant reverse is allowed.\n> \n> Current head direction is L, so next move can be L, U, or D. Not R.\n> \n> The food is at (6,3), which is to the right and same y-coordinate. But since I'm moving left, going right isn't possible directly. I need to plan a path to (6,3).\n> \n> First, let's map out the grid. I'll sketch a grid to visualize.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n> \n> Walls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4). (1,4) and (1,5) are listed, but (1,2) is also there.\n> \n> Snake positions: [(4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3)]\n> \n> Head at (4,3), then (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3). That's 18 segments.\n> \n> (6,3) is part of the snake body? Let's see: positions include (6,3) as the 9th segment? List with indices:\n> \n> Index 0: head (4,3)\n> \n> 1: (5,3)\n> \n> 2: (5,4)\n> \n> 3: (5,5)\n> \n> 4: (5,6)\n> \n> 5: (6,6)\n> \n> 6: (6,5)\n> \n> 7: (6,4)\n> \n> 8: (6,3)  // this is the food position?\n> \n> Food is at (6,3), and (6,3) is in the snake positions as segment 8? Counting: position 0: (4,3), 1: (5,3), 2: (5,4), 3: (5,5), 4: (5,6), 5: (6,6), 6: (6,5), 7: (6,4), 8: (6,3), 9: (6,2), etc.\n> \n> So (6,3) is occupied by the snake body, specifically segment 8.\n> \n> But the food is also at (6,3). The food can spawn under the snake's body, but it can only be eaten if the body moves away and then the head moves onto it.\n> \n> So currently, food is under the snake body at (6,3). To eat it, I need the snake to move so that the body is no longer at (6,3), then later move the head there.\n> \n> Food life span is 8, so I have until turn 88 to eat it.\n> \n> Now, the snake is moving left from (4,3). From (4,3), moving left would go to (3,3), but (3,3) is the tail? Let's see the positions: tail is at (3,3), which is the last position.\n> \n> Positions: ... (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3) — (3,3) is the tail end.\n> \n> Current head at (4,3), moving left to (3,3) would be moving onto the tail.\n> \n> But is that safe? Normally, moving onto the tail is safe because when the head moves to the tail position, the tail will move away in the same turn, so no collision. But there's a special case: Tail Reward Danger.\n> \n> Tail Reward Danger: If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n> \n> In this case, if I move to (3,3), which is the tail, and if there were food there, it might be dangerous, but there is no food at (3,3). Food is only at (6,3), under the body.\n> \n> So moving to (3,3) should be safe, as long as there's no food there.\n> \n> But let's confirm the rules.\n> \n> From core rules: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> And for Tail Reward Danger: only if the tail cell has positive food and head is adjacent to tail.\n> \n> Currently, tail is at (3,3), no food there, so moving to (3,3) should be fine.\n> \n> But let's see the positions: from (4,3) to (3,3), which is the tail. After moving, the head will be at (3,3), and the tail was at (3,3) but moves to the next position.\n> \n> In the sequence, when head moves to a new cell, the body follows, so the tail moves away.\n> \n> Specifically, if head moves to tail position, since tail moves, it doesn't collide.\n> \n> But with food: if tail has food, and you eat it, the tail doesn't move away because the snake grows, so the tail stays, causing collision.\n> \n> In this case, no food at tail, so moving to (3,3) is safe.\n> \n> Now, possible moves from (4,3) with direction L:\n> \n> - L: to (3,3)\n> \n> - U: to (4,4)\n> \n> - D: to (4,2)\n> \n> Now, check if these are valid.\n> \n> First, (3,3): is it a wall? No walls at (3,3), and not an obstacle. It is the tail, but as per rules, moving to tail is safe unless food is there, which it's not. So L should be safe.\n> \n> (4,4): is it occupied? Let's see snake positions: (4,4) not in the list. Head is (4,3), body: (5,3), (5,4), etc. (4,4) is not listed, so empty? But there's an obstacle at (4,4)? Internal obstacles include (4,4), yes: \"Internal Obstacles: [(5, 2), (4, 4), (1, 2), (1, 5), (1,4)]\" so (4,4) is an obstacle! So cannot move there.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,2): is (4,2) occupied? Snake positions: ... (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), ... so (4,2) is the 13th segment? Positions: indices: 0:(4,3), 1:(5,3), 2:(5,4), 3:(5,5), 4:(5,6), 5:(6,6), 6:(6,5), 7:(6,4), 8:(6,3), 9:(6,2), 10:(6,1), 11:(5,1), 12:(4,1), 13:(4,2), 14:(3,2), 15:(2,2), 16:(2,3), 17:(3,3)\n> \n> So (4,2) is position 13, a body segment. So moving to (4,2) would be a body collision, which is deadly. Cannot move there.\n> \n> Therefore, from (4,3), possible moves:\n> \n> - L to (3,3): tail, safe\n> \n> - U to (4,4): but (4,4) is an obstacle, so wall, collision, cannot\n> \n> - D to (4,2): body segment, collision, cannot\n> \n> Only possible move is L to (3,3).\n> \n> But that can't be right? Let me double-check.\n> \n> Head at (4,3), moving left.\n> \n> (3,3) is the tail, which is safe to move to.\n> \n> (4,4) is obstacle, invalid.\n> \n> (4,2) is body segment at index 13, (4,2), yes, so moving there would collide with body.\n> \n> So indeed, only possible move is left to (3,3).\n> \n> But the snake is long, 18 segments, so after moving, the tail will move, and the head is now at (3,3).\n> \n> Then, on next turn, I can move from there.\n> \n> But I need to think about the food at (6,3).\n> \n> Currently, food is under body at (6,3), which is segment 8.\n> \n> To eat it, I need that cell to be free and then move head there.\n> \n> Since the snake is moving, after a few moves, the body might move away from (6,3).\n> \n> But I have to plan a path.\n> \n> First, on turn 81, I must move left to (3,3), as it's the only choice.\n> \n> Then, new head position: (3,3)\n> \n> Old tail was (3,3), but when head moves to (3,3), the snake grows? No, only if I eat food. No food eaten, so snake doesn't grow, tail moves away.\n> \n> After moving head to (3,3), the new positions: head is now (3,3), and the body: the segment that was at (4,3) moves to where? Let's trace.\n> \n> Current positions before move: let's list them in order:\n> \n> Index: 0: (4,3) head\n> \n> 1: (5,3)\n> \n> 2: (5,4)\n> \n> 3: (5,5)\n> \n> 4: (5,6)\n> \n> 5: (6,6)\n> \n> 6: (6,5)\n> \n> 7: (6,4)\n> \n> 8: (6,3)\n> \n> 9: (6,2)\n> \n> 10: (6,1)\n> \n> 11: (5,1)\n> \n> 12: (4,1)\n> \n> 13: (4,2)\n> \n> 14: (3,2)\n> \n> 15: (2,2)\n> \n> 16: (2,3)\n> \n> 17: (3,3) tail\n> \n> Now, move head to (3,3). Since no food eaten, tail moves off.\n> \n> New head: (3,3)\n> \n> Then body: segment 0 was (4,3), now becomes part of body, so position 1: (4,3)\n> \n> Then 2: (5,3)\n> \n> 3: (5,4)\n> \n> ...\n> \n> up to segment 16: (2,3)? Let's see.\n> \n> After head moves to new position, each segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> So new positions:\n> \n> Head: (3,3)  // new head position\n> \n> Then, segment 1: old position 0: (4,3)\n> \n> Segment 2: old position 1: (5,3)\n> \n> Segment 3: old position 2: (5,4)\n> \n> Segment 4: old position 3: (5,5)\n> \n> Segment 5: old position 4: (5,6)\n> \n> Segment 6: old position 5: (6,6)\n> \n> Segment 7: old position 6: (6,5)\n> \n> Segment 8: old position 7: (6,4)\n> \n> Segment 9: old position 8: (6,3)  // now at (6,3)\n> \n> Segment 10: old position 9: (6,2)\n> \n> Segment 11: old position 10: (6,1)\n> \n> Segment 12: old position 11: (5,1)\n> \n> Segment 13: old position 12: (4,1)\n> \n> Segment 14: old position 13: (4,2)\n> \n> Segment 15: old position 14: (3,2)\n> \n> Segment 16: old position 15: (2,2)\n> \n> Segment 17: old position 16: (2,3)  // tail was old 17: (3,3), but head moved there, so tail is now old position 16: (2,3)\n> \n> Old tail was index 17: (3,3), head moved to (3,3), so the tail is removed, and new tail is what was index 16: (2,3)\n> \n> New positions: head (3,3), then (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3)  // 18 segments?

So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls block those cells.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (3,3), then body segments: (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3). That's 18 segments. Let me list them in order:\n> \n> 1. Head: (3,3)\n> \n> 2. (4,3)\n> \n> 3. (5,3)\n> \n> 4. (5,4)\n> \n> 5. (5,5)\n> \n> 6. (5,6)\n> \n> 7. (6,6)\n> \n> 8. (6,5)\n> \n> 9.

Similarly, (1,1) has life span 10, disappears at turn 92.\n> \n> Now, I see that food at (6,3) is listed, but in the snake positions, (6,3) is the 10th segment. So food is under the snake's body at (6,3). According to the rules, food can spawn under the body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and the head moves onto it. So currently, (6,3) is occupied by the snake, so the food there can't be eaten until the snake moves off that cell and the head moves back later.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,1) is a free cell, I think. Let me check if it's occupied or not.\n> \n> Snake positions: from above, (1,1) is not in the list, so it should be free. Internal obstacles include (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), but not (1,1), so (1,1) should be accessible, but it's near the border and obstacles.\n> \n> Walls: border cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so (1,1) is not a wall, and no internal obstacle at (1,1), so it should be free.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan an action sequence for at least 5 turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks.

Positions: head at (3,3), previous was (4,3), and direction is L, which makes sense since from (4,3) to (3,3) is left.\n> \n> Now, possible moves from (3,3): since direction is L, I can move L (left), U (up), or D (down), but not R (right) because that would be instant reverse, which is not allowed.\n> \n> No instant reverse: cannot move opposite to current direction.

Snake positions: (2,3) is the tail, position 18: (2,3). But moving to tail is allowed only if the tail moves away, so it might be safe.\n> \n> In snake movement, when you move, the head goes to a new cell, each segment moves to the previous position of the next segment, so the tail moves to where the second last was, but since it's a list, when head moves, tail is removed unless food is eaten.\n> \n> Standard snake: if no food eaten, head moves to new position, tail is removed. If food eaten, head moves to food, tail not removed, so snake grows.\n> \n> In this case, moving to (2,3), which is currently occupied by the tail. Since the tail will move away when the snake moves, it should be safe to move there, as long as after the move, the head is not colliding with body.\n> \n> Similarly, walls: (2,3) is x=2,y=3, not a border wall, and not an internal obstacle? Internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4). (2,3) not in that list, so should be free except for the snake tail.\n> \n> Now, (3,4): up. (3,4) not in snake positions? Snake positions: let's list all: (3,3),(4,3),(5,3),(5,4),(5,5),(5,6),(6,6),(6,5),(6,4),(6,3),(6,2),(6,1),(5,1),(4,1),(4,2),(3,2),(2,2),(2,3). So (3,4) not there, and walls: not border, not internal obstacle, so should be free.\n> \n> (3,2): down. (3,2) is position 16: (3,2), so occupied by body. But it's not the tail; it's a body segment. Moving to (3,2) would cause collision because it's a body part that won't move away immediately.\n> \n> Positions: (3,2) is segment 16, and after that is (2,2) and (2,3). If I move to (3,2), since it's not the tail, the segment at (3,2) will still be there when head moves in, causing collision.\n> \n> Only moving to the tail is potentially safe because the tail moves.\n> \n> In this case, (3,2) is not the tail; the tail is (2,3). So moving to (3,2) should cause collision.\n> \n> Similarly, for (2,3), it is the tail, so moving there might be safe if the tail moves.\n> \n> But let's confirm the rules.\n> \n> \"Deadly Collisions: Body collision (head touches any body segment).

Let's see the positions.\n> \n> Initial positions: head (3,4), then body (3,3), (4,3), etc. to tail (2,2).\n> \n> After moving head to (3,5), the new head is (3,5), and the first body segment is the old head (3,4), then the next is the old first body (3,3), then (4,3), and so on, up to the old second last which was (3,2) at index 16, which is now the tail, and the old tail (2,2) is removed.\n> \n> So the cell (6,3) was occupied by the segment that was at index 10. After move, that segment is now at the position of old index 9, which is (6,4)? Old positions: index 9 was (6,4), index 10 was (6,3).\n> \n> After move, the segment that was at index 10 ( (6,3) ) is now at the position of old index 9, which is (6,4), because each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment in the list.\n> \n> In general, for body segment i, it moves to the position of segment i-1 after head moves.\n> \n> Since the head moves to a new position, segment 1 moves to old head position, segment 2 moves to old segment 1 position, ..., segment k moves to old segment k-1 position, and the tail segment is removed if no growth.\n> \n> So for the cell (6,3), it was occupied by segment index 10. After one move, segment index 10 moves to the position of old segment 9, which is (6,4). So the cell (6,3) is now occupied by segment index 11, which was at (6,2), but segment index 11 moves to old index 10 position, which is (6,3). So after the move, (6,3) is still occupied by the body, but by a different segment: the one that was previously at (6,2).\n> \n> In terms of the cell, (6,3) remains occupied until the segment that is there moves away, which only happens when the tail moves past it.\n> \n> The cell will be free when the tail is at that position and then moves away.\n> \n> Currently, tail is at (2,2). The distance from tail to (6,3) in the snake chain is 10 segments apart (from index 17 to index 10, difference 7? Index tail is 17, (6,3) is 10, so 17-10=7 segments between, including the tail or not?\n> \n> Positions: tail index 17, then 16,15,14,13,12,11,10 is (6,3). So from tail to (6,3), there are 7 segments: 17,16,15,14,13,12,11, then 10.\n> \n> So it will take at least 7 moves for the tail to reach the position where (6,3) is, but since the snake is moving, the cell (6,3) may be occupied for a while.\n> \n> After 7 moves without eating, the tail will be at the cell that was (6,3) at turn 83.\n> \n> At turn 83, (6,3) occupied.\n> \n> After one move (turn 84), (6,3) still occupied, as above.\n> \n> After two moves, similarly, it will still be occupied.\n> \n> Only when the tail is at (6,3) and the snake moves, then (6,3) is freed.\n> \n> The tail is at (2,2) now. The path from (2,2) to (6,3) along the snake is not direct; it's through the body positions.\n> \n> The cell (6,3) will be freed when the tail reaches (6,3) and then moves away.\n> \n> The tail is at (2,2), and the snake must move so that the tail moves towards (6,3), but it's not moving freely; it follows the head's movement.\n> \n> The number of moves until (6,3) is free depends on how the snake moves.\n> \n> Since the snake is convoluted, it might take a minimum of Manhattan distance or more.\n> \n> From (2,2) to (6,3), |dx|=4, |dy|=1, min moves 5, but because of the body, it might be longer.\n> \n> For example, the tail at (2,2), next it can move to (3,2) or other, but it depends on the head movement.\n> \n> It's complicated. Perhaps for simplicity, since the food at (6,3) has only 6 turns life, and it might take more than 6 moves to free it, so it might disappear before we can eat it.\n> \n> Life span 6 turns, from turn 83 to 88, it exists.\n> \n> But to eat it, we need to free the cell and then move head there.\n> \n> At turn 83, it is occupied.\n> \n> Even if we move in a way to free it quickly, it might not be possible soon.\n> \n> For example, the tail is at (2,2), and (6,3) is far.

It's turn 84, and I'm playing Snake on a grid. The grid has walls: border cells at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and internal obstacles at (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), and (1,4). So, I can't move into these cells.\n> \n> The snake positions are given as a list: head is at (2,4), then (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2). That's 18 segments. The head direction is left (L), so it's moving left.\n> \n> Food positions: there are two pieces of food.\n> \n> - One at (6,3) with value 1 and life span 5. But (6,3) is currently occupied by the snake's body? Let me check the snake positions. The snake has segments at (6,3), (6,2), etc. Specifically, (6,3) is the 12th segment in the list? Let's index them.\n> \n> Snake positions: index 0: (2,4) head, 1: (3,4), 2: (3,3), 3: (4,3), 4: (5,3), 5: (5,4), 6: (5,5), 7: (5,6), 8: (6,6), 9: (6,5), 10: (6,4), 11: (6,3), 12: (6,2), 13: (6,1), 14: (5,1), 15: (4,1), 16: (4,2), 17: (3,2) tail.\n> \n> So (6,3) is position 11, which is a body segment. Food at (6,3) has value 1 and life span 5. But since it's under the snake's body, it can only be eaten if the body moves away and the head moves onto it later. Life span is 5, meaning it will disappear after 5 turns, including this turn, so it has 5 turns left starting from now? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 84, life_span=5, it will disappear after turn 88? Let's clarify.\n> \n> If life_span is N, it disappears after N turns. Countdown decreases every turn, so at turn t, if life_span is L, it will be there until turn t + L - 1, and disappear at turn t + L? Typically, if life_span is given as 5 at turn 84, it means:\n> \n> - Turn 84: countdown 5\n> \n> - Turn 85: countdown 4\n> \n> - Turn 86: countdown 3\n> \n> - Turn 87: countdown 2\n> \n> - Turn 88: countdown 1\n> \n> - Turn 89: disappears? Or after turn 88?\n> \n> The problem says: \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So, at turn t, with life_span L, the food will be present for L more turns, including turn t. So it disappears at the start of turn t + L, or end of turn t + L - 1? I need to be precise.\n> \n> It says: \"disappears after N turns\", meaning after N turns from now, it's gone. And \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So for food at turn t with life_span N, at turn t, countdown=N; turn t+1, countdown=N-1; ... turn t+N-1, countdown=1; then at turn t+N, it disappears.\n> \n> So for the food at (6,3), turn 84, life_span=5, it will be there until turn 88 (countdown 1 on turn 88), and disappear at turn 89.\n> \n> Similarly, the other food at (1,1) with value 1 and life_span=8, so it will be there until turn 91 (turn 84+8-1=91? Turn 84: countdown 8, t85:7, ..., t91:1, t92: gone. So last chance to eat is turn 91.\n> \n> Now, the head is at (2,4), moving left. From (2,4), moving left would go to (1,4). But (1,4) is an internal obstacle! Look: internal obstacles include (1,4), (1,5), (1,2), etc. So (1,4) is a wall, I can't move there.\n> \n> Also, the snake is moving left, but from (2,4) to (1,4) is blocked. So what are possible moves?\n> \n> Current head position: (2,4)\n> \n> Head direction: L (left)\n> \n> Possible moves: U (up), D (down), L (left), but L is towards (1,4) which is a wall, so not possible.\n> \n> R (right) is opposite to current direction, but the rule says \"No instant reverse\": cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn. Current direction is L, so opposite is R. So I cannot move right immediately.\n> \n> But moving left is blocked by wall, so I must choose between U or D.\n> \n> Possible directions from (2,4):\n> \n> - U: to (2,5)  y+1\n> \n> - D: to (2,3)  y-1\n> \n> - L: to (1,4) but wall, invalid\n> \n> - R: to (3,4) but (3,4) is the first body segment? Snake positions: head (2,4), then (3,4) is the next segment, which is the neck. Moving right to (3,4) would cause collision because the body is there and won't move away until after the move? But in Snake, when you move, the head moves to a new cell, and the tail moves, so if you move to where the neck is, it should be ok because the neck will move forward, but let's see the collision rules.\n> \n> \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> In this case, moving to (3,4): (3,4) is the first body segment, not the tail. The tail is at (3,2). So moving to (3,4) would be head touching a body segment that isn't the tail, so it should be a collision.\n> \n> Confirm the positions:\n> \n> - Head: (2,4)\n> \n> - Segment 1: (3,4)\n> \n> If I move right to (3,4), after the move, the head would be at (3,4), but segment 1 was at (3,4), and now it will move to where the head was or something? Standard Snake movement: when the head moves to a new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment before it. So if head moves from (2,4) to (3,4), but (3,4) is currently occupied by segment 1. After the move, head is at (3,4), and segment 1 moves to (2,4), which was the previous head position. But at the moment of move, when head moves to (3,4), it is colliding with the body segment that is still there, before it moves.\n> \n> Typically in Snake, collision is checked before the body moves, so if the head moves to a cell occupied by any body segment except the tail, it dies. Only if moving to the tail cell, it might be ok because the tail moves away.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So for a cell that is not the tail, if head moves there, it collides.\n> \n> In this case, (3,4) is segment 1, not tail, so moving to (3,4) should cause collision and death.\n> \n> Therefore, moving right is not possible because it's opposite direction and also blocked by body.\n> \n> Similarly, moving left to (1,4) is wall, impossible.\n> \n> So only possible moves are up or down: to (2,5) or (2,3).\n> \n> Now, check if those are valid.\n> \n> First, (2,5): is it wall? Border walls are x=0,7 or y=0,7, so y=5 is not border. Internal obstacles: (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), (4,4), (5,2). (2,5) is not in internal obstacles, so should be free.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,3): not border, not in internal obstacles (obstacles are at (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), (4,4), (5,2)), so (2,3) is free.\n> \n> Also, no body segments at (2,5) or (2,3)? Snake positions: (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), etc. (2,5) is not listed, (2,3) is not listed, so both are empty.\n> \n> So possible moves: U to (2,5) or D to (2,3).\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead and maximize score, avoiding risks.\n> \n> Food available:\n> \n> - (6,3) with value 1, life_span 5, so must be eaten by turn 88 (since turn 84: countdown 5, t85:4, t86:3, t87:2, t88:1, t89: gone). So last chance turn 88.\n> \n> But (6,3) is currently under the snake body at position 11. To eat it, the snake must move away from (6,3) so the food is exposed, then later head moves to it.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (1,1) with value 1, life_span 8, so last chance turn 91.\n> \n> (1,1) might be accessible, but it's near obstacles.\n> \n> Also, there's a risk with tail and food, but let's see.\n> \n> First, I need to choose between U or D for this turn.\n> \n> Let me sketch the grid.\n> \n> Grid from x=0 to 7, y=0 to 7.

After moving, the head will be at (2,5), and the tail moves forward, so the segment at (3,2) will be removed?

It's turn 85. The grid has walls: border cells at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the grid is from (1,1) to (6,6) since x and y start from 0 to 7, but borders are walls, so playable area is x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6. Also, internal obstacles at (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4). So I should list all wall cells:\n> \n> - Borders: all cells where x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7.\n> \n> - Internal: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4)\n> \n> (1,4) and (1,5) are listed, but (1,2) is also there. So obstacles: (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), (4,4), (5,2).\n> \n> Now snake positions: head at (2,3), then body: (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2). That's 18 segments.\n> \n> Head direction is D, which is down. Since head is at (2,3) and direction down, that means last move was down to (2,3), but since direction is given as current head direction, I think it means the snake is facing down, so moving down would go to (2,2), but let's see.\n> \n> Head at (2,3), direction D, so if it moves down, it goes to (2,2). But (2,2) might be occupied or not, I need to check.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (6,3) with life span 4, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (1,1) with life span 7, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (5,5) with life span 10, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> All food is positive, no negative food here.\n> \n> Life span: for (6,3) it's 4 turns including current, so it disappears after turn 85+3=88? Let's see: life span N, disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current.\n> \n> So at turn 85, life span 4 means: after turn 85, it has 4 turns left, including turn 85. After turn 85, countdown to 3, then turn 86 to 2, turn 87 to 1, turn 88 it disappears. So it can be eaten on turns 85,86,87.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,1) life span 7: can be eaten from turn 85 to 85+6=91? After turn 85, life span 7, so turns left: 7 at start of turn 85, after eating or not, at end of turn, it decreases.\n> \n> The rule: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So when food is present, at the beginning of each turn, the life span decreases by 1? Or after the turn?\n> \n> It says: \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> I think it means that when food is spawned, it has a life span of N. At each turn, including the turn it is spawned, the countdown decreases by 1. When countdown reaches 0, it disappears.\n> \n> For example, if life span is 4 at turn 85, then:\n> \n> - Turn 85: countdown=4, can be eaten, after turn, countdown=3\n> \n> - Turn 86: countdown=3, can be eaten, after turn countdown=2\n> \n> - Turn 87: countdown=2, can be eaten, after turn countdown=1\n> \n> - Turn 88: countdown=1, can be eaten, after turn countdown=0, disappears\n> \n> - Turn 89: gone\n> \n> So it can be eaten on turns 85 to 88.\n> \n> Similarly for others.\n> \n> (6,3) life span 4: can be eaten turns 85,86,87,88\n> \n> (1,1) life span 7: turns 85 to 91\n> \n> (5,5) life span 10: turns 85 to 94\n> \n> Now, snake head at (2,3), direction D (down).\n> \n> Possible moves: since direction is D, I can move U, L, R, but not D?

Snake positions: head (2,3), then (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), etc. So (3,3) is the fourth segment, so it is occupied by body.\n> \n> Collision rules: if head moves to a cell occupied by body, it dies, except if it's the tail and tail moves away.\n> \n> Specifically: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment).

(4,2) is not neighbor.\n> \n> So no issue now.\n> \n> First, let's consider moving to (2,2) or (1,3).\n> \n> If I move to (2,2), then I am closer to (1,1)? (2,2) to (1,1) is adjacent, I can move left to (1,2), but (1,2) is an obstacle! Internal obstacle at (1,2), so I cannot move to (1,2).\n> \n> From (2,2), possible moves: head at (2,2), direction D (since I moved down).\n> \n> Then can move U, D, L, R, but no reverse. Direction is D, so cannot move U.\n> \n> Move L to (1,2): but (1,2) is obstacle, wall, cannot.\n> \n> Move R to (3,2): is (3,2) free? Not in snake, not wall? Walls: internal (5,2) but not (3,2), so free? Snake positions: (6,2) is body, but (3,2) not listed, so free.\n> \n> Move D to (2,1): y=1, x=2, not border (border y=0,7), so y=1 is playable, not obstacle, not snake? Snake has (6,1), (5,1), etc., but (2,1) not, so free.\n> \n> Move U to (2,3): but (2,3) is previous head, now body? After moving to (2,2), the snake body: tail moves, so new positions: head moves to (2,2), then body follows: segment 1 was (2,4) moves to head old position (2,3)? Let's think.\n> \n> When snake moves, head goes to new cell, then each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead.\n> \n> So from current: positions: [(2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2)]\n> \n> After move down to (2,2): new head at (2,2), then segment 1 (was (2,4)) moves to where head was (2,3), segment 2 (was (3,4)) moves to where segment 1 was (2,4)? No.\n> \n> The segment that was at index i moves to the position of index i-1 from previous state, but since head moved, the new body segments are: the old positions from index 0 to len-2, but shifted.\n> \n> New positions: head at new position (2,2), then body[0] at old head position (2,3), body[1] at old body[0] position (2,4), body[2] at old body[1] position (3,4), and so on, up to body[17] at old body[16] position, which was (4,1)? Old body[16] is (4,1), but tail was (4,2), let's index.\n> \n> Old positions: index 0: (2,3) head\n> \n> 1: (2,4)\n> \n> 2: (3,4)\n> \n> 3: (3,3)\n> \n> 4: (4,3)\n> \n> 5: (5,3)\n> \n> 6: (5,4)\n> \n> 7: (5,5)\n> \n> 8: (5,6)\n> \n> 9: (6,6)\n> \n> 10: (6,5)\n> \n> 11: (6,4)\n> \n> 12: (6,3)\n> \n> 13: (6,2)\n> \n> 14: (6,1)\n> \n> 15: (5,1)\n> \n> 16: (4,1)\n> \n> 17: (4,2) tail\n> \n> After move down, head to (2,2), then:\n> \n> New body: the old positions from index 0 to 16 become the new body, so:\n> \n> New position 0: head at (2,2)\n> \n> New position 1: old pos index 0, (2,3)\n> \n> New position 2: old pos index 1, (2,4)\n> \n> New position 3: old pos index 2, (3,4)\n> \n> New position 4: old pos index 3, (3,3)\n> \n> New position 5: old pos index 4, (4,3)\n> \n> And so on, up to new position 17: old pos index 16, (4,1)\n> \n> Old tail (4,2) is gone, since tail moves away.\n> \n> So new tail is at (4,1), which was old position 16.\n> \n> Now, the food at (6,3) is under old position 12, which was (6,3). After move, that cell is now occupied by new position 13? Let's see: new position 13 is old pos index 12, (6,3), but food is there, so still under body, not accessible.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,5) is old pos index 7, which is now new position 8? After move, the body segments shift, but the cell (5,5) is now occupied by new position 8, which is old pos index 7, (5,5), so still under body.\n> \n> (1,1) is free.\n> \n> Back to choice.\n> \n> If I move to (2,2) at turn 85.\n> \n> Then at turn 86, head at (2,2), direction D.\n> \n> Possible moves: U, D, L, R, but no reverse. Direction D, so cannot U.\n> \n> Move L to (1,2): obstacle, wall, cannot.\n> \n> Move R to (3,2): free, as above.\n> \n> Move D to (2,1): free.\n> \n> Move U to (2,3): but (2,3) is now body, new position 1, not tail, so collision if move there, and also cannot U because reverse.\n> \n> So from (2,2), can move R to (3,2) or D to (2,1).\n> \n> If move to (3,2), then direction R.\n> \n> Then can go to (4,2) but (4,2) is obstacle? Internal obstacle at (5,2), not (4,2). (4,2) is not listed, so should be free, but after move, let's see.\n> \n> At turn 85, if I move to (2,2), then turn 86.\n> \n> But I need to think about the other choice first.\n> \n> Alternative: at turn 85, move left to (1,3).\n> \n> Then head at (1,3), direction L.\n> \n> Then possible moves: from (1,3), direction L, so cannot move R (reverse).\n> \n> Move U to (1,4): but (1,4) is obstacle, wall, cannot.\n> \n> Move D to (1,2): obstacle, cannot.\n> \n> Move L to (0,3): but x=0, border wall, cannot.\n> \n> Move R to (2,3): but (2,3) is now body? After moving to (1,3), new positions: head at (1,3), body: old head (2,3) becomes new body[0], then old body[1] (2,4) to new body[1], etc.\n> \n> So (2,3) is occupied by body, not tail, so moving to (2,3) would be collision.\n> \n> And only possible moves from (1,3) are U, D, L, R, but U to (1,4) wall, D to (1,2) wall, L to (0,3) wall, R to (2,3) body, all invalid!\n> \n> So moving to (1,3) at turn 85 is suicide! Because from (1,3), I have no safe moves; all adjacent cells are wall or body.\n> \n> Adjacent cells: up (1,4) is obstacle, down (1,2) obstacle, left (0,3) border wall, right (2,3) is body (after move, it's occupied).\n> \n> So indeed, moving to (1,3) leads to death next turn. Must avoid.\n> \n> Therefore, at turn 85, the only safe move is down to (2,2).\n> \n> I have to move to (2,2).\n> \n> Then turn 85: move D to (2,2)\n> \n> Now, turn 86: head at (2,2), direction D (since moved down).\n> \n> Possible moves: as above, cannot U (reverse), cannot L to (1,2) wall, so only R to (3,2) or D to (2,1).\n> \n> Now, need to think ahead.\n> \n> First, let's list the grid with obstacles.\n> \n> Playable grid: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), (4,4), (5,2)\n> \n> Also, borders are walls, but we don't move there.\n> \n> Now, snake at turn 86 after moving to (2,2) at turn 85.\n> \n> After turn 85 move D to (2,2), positions:\n> \n> Head: (2,2)\n> \n> Body: (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2) but (4,2) was tail, now moved?

It's turn 86, and I'm playing Snake on a 7x7 grid since the borders are from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7. That means the grid is 8x8 because it includes both 0 and 7, so cells from (0,0) to (7,7). But walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think. Let me confirm.\n> \n> The walls are defined as border cells: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So, moving to any cell with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 is a wall collision. Also, there are internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4). So these cells are blocked and can't be moved into.\n> \n> Snake positions: The head is at (2,2), and it's moving down (direction D). The full snake body is given as a list: [(2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1)]. So the head is at index 0: (2,2), and the tail is at the end: (4,1). Since the snake is moving down, and head is at (2,2), moving down would be to (2,1), but let's see the direction.\n> \n> Head direction is given as D, which is down, so (x,y-1). Current head is (2,2), so moving down would be to (2,1).\n> \n> Now, food positions:\n> \n> - (6,3) with life span 3 and value 1 (positive food)\n> \n> - (1,1) with life span 6 and value 1 (positive food)\n> \n> - (5,5) with life span 9 and value 1 (positive food)\n> \n> All food is positive, no negative food mentioned. Value is 1 for all, and life span is given.\n> \n> Life span decreases every turn, including current turn. So on turn 86, for food at (6,3), life span 3 means it will disappear after 3 more turns? Let me read the rule.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So, at the time of state input, life_span is the number of turns remaining, including the current turn. For example, food at (6,3) with life_span 3: on turn 86, it is present; after turn 86, life_span becomes 2; after turn 87, it becomes 1; after turn 88, it disappears. So it can be eaten on turns 86, 87, or 88.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,1) with life_span 6: present from turn 86 to 91, eaten before turn 92.\n> \n> (5,5) with life_span 9: present from turn 86 to 94.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks.

But internal obstacles, so some cells are blocked.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4)\n> \n> (1,4) and (1,5) are obstacles, and (1,2), so row y=1 has obstacles at x=1,4,5?

(4,1) tail\n> \n> The snake is quite long, 18 segments.\n> \n> Now, head is at (2,2), direction down. So possible moves: since direction is down, I can move down, left, or right, but not up because that would be reverse, which is not allowed. Rule: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\" Current direction is down, so opposite is up. So I cannot move up on the next turn. Possible moves: down, left, right.\n> \n> Now, let's see what cells are around (2,2):\n> \n> - Down: (2,1) - y=1, x=2. Is this a wall? y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=1 is not a wall. Borders are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so (2,1) is within bounds, x=2 between 1 and 6, y=1 between 1 and 6. Also, is it occupied? Snake body: let's list all snake positions to see.\n> \n> Snake positions: (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1)\n> \n> So (2,1) is not in this list, so it should be empty. But is it an obstacle? Internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4). (2,1) is not an obstacle. So (2,1) is free? But (2,1) is at x=2,y=1.\n> \n> y=1, x=2: not a wall, not an obstacle, not occupied by snake. So moving down to (2,1) is possible.\n> \n> Left: (1,2) - but (1,2) is an internal obstacle! Yes, (1,2) is listed as an internal obstacle, so cannot move there.\n> \n> Right: (3,2) - let's see, x=3,y=2. Is this occupied? Snake has (3,3), (3,4), but not (3,2). Obstacles: no, (3,2) not listed. Walls: no. So (3,2) should be free.\n> \n> Also, up: (2,3) but that's the body, and we cannot move up because it's reverse direction, but even if we could, it's occupied.\n> \n> So from (2,2), with direction down, possible actions:\n> \n> - Down to (2,1): empty\n> \n> - Left to (1,2): obstacle, invalid\n> \n> - Right to (3,2): empty\n> \n> Cannot go up.\n> \n> So only two choices: down to (2,1) or right to (3,2).\n> \n> Now, I need to think about food and future moves.\n> \n> Food locations:\n> \n> - (6,3): life span 3, so can be eaten on turn 86,87,88\n> \n> - (1,1): life span 6, turns 86 to 91\n> \n> - (5,5): life span 9, turns 86 to 94\n> \n> (6,3) has short life, only 3 turns left, including current, so I might want to get it soon if possible.\n> \n> But (6,3) is currently occupied by the snake! Look at snake positions: index 14 is (6,3), which is part of the body.\n> \n> Rule about food under body: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> Also, \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head is adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it kills because of collision.\n> \n> In this case, (6,3) has food, but it's under the snake body. Specifically, (6,3) is occupied by the 14th segment of the snake. When the snake moves, this cell might be freed if the tail moves away.\n> \n> Let's see the tail: tail is at (4,1). When the snake moves, the tail will move, but (6,3) is not the tail; it's a body segment.\n> \n> To eat food under body, the body must move away, meaning that the segment occupying it must leave that cell, and then later, the head can move to it.\n> \n> Currently, (6,3) is occupied, so food cannot be eaten now. I need to wait for the snake to move so that (6,3) is vacated.\n> \n> Similarly, other food: (1,1) is empty? Let's see, is (1,1) occupied? Snake positions: no (1,1). Obstacles: (1,2), (1,4), (1,5) but not (1,1). Walls: not border wall. So (1,1) is free and has food.\n> \n> (5,5) has food: snake has (5,5) at index 9, so it's occupied by body. So similarly, cannot eat now.\n> \n> So all food except possibly (1,1) is under body or something.\n> \n> (1,1) is not occupied, so it can be eaten if head moves there.\n> \n> (6,3) is occupied, (5,5) is occupied.\n> \n> For (6,3), life span 3, meaning after turn 88 it disappears. So if not eaten by turn 88, it's gone.\n> \n> Similarly, others have more time.\n> \n> Now, back to immediate move: from (2,2), I can go down to (2,1) or right to (3,2).\n> \n> If I go down to (2,1), that's moving towards (1,1), which has food.\n> \n> (1,1) is at (1,1), and (2,1) is adjacent to it: down from (2,1) would be to (2,0), which is wall, or left to (1,1), or right to (3,1), etc.\n> \n> But let's think step by step.\n> \n> First, option 1: move down to (2,1) on turn 86.\n> \n> Then head is at (2,1), direction is now down (since I moved down).\n> \n> From (2,1), possible moves: down to (2,0) but y=0 is wall, invalid.\n> \n> Left to (1,1): which has food! So I can eat it.\n> \n> But is it safe? (1,1) is not adjacent to tail or anything? Tail is at (4,1), which is not adjacent to (1,1). Adjacent means sharing an edge, so (1,1) adjacent cells: (1,2), (1,0), (0,1), (2,1).\n> \n> (1,2) is obstacle, (1,0) wall, (0,1) wall, (2,1) is where head is coming from? When head moves to (1,1), the tail is at (4,1), which is not adjacent to (1,1). Distance: (1,1) to (4,1) is |x-diff| =3, not adjacent.\n> \n> So eating (1,1) should be fine, no tail collision risk.\n> \n> But after eating, snake grows, so length increases by one.\n> \n> Now, if I go to (2,1) and then to (1,1), I eat food at turn 87? Turn 86: move to (2,1), no food there, so no eat. Then turn 87: move to (1,1), which has food, so eat it.\n> \n> Life span: food at (1,1) has life span 6 on turn 86. After turn 86, it becomes 5, then on turn 87, when I eat, it should be fine.\n> \n> Now, option 2: move right to (3,2) on turn 86.\n> \n> Then head at (3,2), direction now right? I moved right from (2,2) to (3,2), so direction is now R (right).\n> \n> From there, possible moves: right to (4,2), up to (3,3), down to (3,1), left to (2,2) but that's reverse, not allowed.\n> \n> (3,3) is occupied by snake body? Snake has (3,3) at index 5? Positions: index 5 is (3,3), which is body segment.\n> \n> (4,2): is it free? Snake: not listed, obstacles: (5,2) is obstacle, but (4,2) not listed. Walls: no. So (4,2) should be free.\n> \n> (3,1): y=1, x=3, should be free? Snake has (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), but not (3,1). Obstacles no. So free.\n> \n> So from (3,2), I can go to (4,2), (3,1), or (3,3) but (3,3) occupied, so invalid.\n> \n> (3,3) is occupied, so cannot go up to (3,3).\n> \n> So possible: right to (4,2) or down to (3,1).\n> \n> Now, comparing the two options.\n> \n> If I go down to (2,1) now, I can then go to (1,1) next turn and eat the food there.\n> \n> If I go right to (3,2), I might go towards other areas.\n> \n> But I need to think long-term. Also, the food at (6,3) is about to disappear soon, only 3 turns left.\n> \n> (6,3) is currently occupied, but when the snake moves, it might free up.\n> \n> Let's simulate the snake movement.\n> \n> Current snake: head (2,2), then body: (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1) tail.\n> \n> When the snake moves, the head moves to a new position, and the tail moves forward, so the last segment is removed.\n> \n> For example, if I move down to (2,1) on turn 86:\n> \n> - Head moves to (2,1)\n> \n> - Tail (4,1) is removed? No, when head moves to new cell, and tail moves only if no growth. Since no food eaten, tail is removed.\n> \n> So after move: new positions: head at (2,1), then segments: the old head to tail except tail is removed, so body: (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1) and tail was (4,1), so removed, so new tail is (5,1)? Let's index.\n> \n> Old positions: indices 0 to 17: 0:(2,2), 1:(2,3), 2:(2,4), 3:(3,4), 4:(3,3), 5:(4,3), 6:(5,3), 7:(5,4), 8:(5,5), 9:(5,6), 10:(6,6), 11:(6,5), 12:(6,4), 13:(6,3), 14:(6,2), 15:(6,1), 16:(5,1), 17:(4,1)\n> \n> After moving head to (2,1), the new head is (2,1), and the body is the old positions from 0 to 16, but position 0 becomes new body segment 1, so new body: segment 1: old pos 0 (2,2), segment 2: old pos 1 (2,3), ..., up to segment 17: old pos 16 (5,1), and tail old pos 17 (4,1) is removed. So new snake: [(2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1)] with tail at (5,1).\n> \n> Length is still 18, no growth.\n> \n> Then on turn 87, if I move to (1,1), head to (1,1), which has food, so I eat it. Then snake grows, so tail doesn't move. New positions: head at (1,1), then the previous body including tail: so new snake: [(1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1)] with tail at (5,1), but now length 19.\n> \n> (5,1) is still tail, but after growth, the tail stays, so positions are the same except new head.\n> \n> Now, back to (6,3) food. In the new position after turn 86 move, (6,3) is still occupied by the snake? In the new snake above, after moving to (2,1), (6,3) is still there, at position index 14 or something.\n> \n> In the list: after turn 86, snake has (6,3) as a body segment.\n> \n> When does it free up? The tail is at (5,1), which is far. As the snake moves, the tail will eventually move, but it might take time.\n> \n> Specifically, (6,3) is occupied until the segment that is there moves away. The segment at (6,3) will move when the snake advances.\n> \n> For example, if I continue moving, the body will shift.\n> \n> But (6,3) has only 3 turns life, including turn 86.\n> \n> On turn 86: if I don't eat it, life span decreases.\n> \n> Turn 86: current state, food at (6,3) with life span 3.\n> \n> After turn 86, if not eaten, life span becomes 2.\n> \n> Turn 87: if not eaten, becomes 1.\n> \n> Turn 88: if not eaten, disappears after turn.\n> \n> To eat it, I need the head to be on (6,3) when it is free and food is present.\n> \n> Currently occupied, so must be vacated first.\n> \n> Similarly for (5,5).\n> \n> Now, for (6,3), it might be hard to get it in time because the snake is long and (6,3) is deep in the body.\n> \n> Let's see the path to free (6,3).\n> \n> The segment at (6,3) is part of the body. When the snake moves, that segment will move to where the previous segment was, but it depends on the movement.\n> \n> For example, in the current position, (6,3) is index 13? Old positions: index 13: (6,3)\n> \n> In the sequence, when head moves, the body follows.\n> \n> If I move in a way that the snake uncoils or something.\n> \n> But it might be tight with only 3 turns.\n> \n> Perhaps I should go for (1,1) first since it's accessible.\n> \n> But let's consider the risk.\n> \n> Another thing: the grid has obstacles, so I need to avoid dead ends.\n> \n> First, let's list all occupied cells.\n> \n> Playable grid: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6.\n> \n> Obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,4), (1,5)\n> \n> (1,4) and (1,5) are obstacles, and (1,2), so in row y=1, cells: (1,1) is food, (1,2) obstacle, (1,3)? not obstacle, but snake or something? (1,3) not listed, so free? Similarly, (1,4) obstacle, (1,5) obstacle, (1,6) is y=6, x=1, not border? y=6 is not wall, walls are y=0 and y=7, so y=6 is playable. But (1,6) not obstacle, so free.\n> \n> Similarly, other points.\n> \n> Now, snake occupies: from the list, many cells.\n> \n> Free cells: for example, (1,1) food, (1,3), (1,6), (2,1), (2,2) head but will move, (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), etc., but many are occupied.\n> \n> After moving to (2,1), free cells include (1,1), (1,3), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), etc.\n> \n> (4,2) is free? Earlier I thought so.\n> \n> But (5,2) is obstacle, so (4,2) should be free.\n> \n> Now, back to actions.\n> \n> If I go to (2,1) on turn 86, then to (1,1) on turn 87 to eat food.\n> \n> Then I have +1 score.\n> \n> But after that, where to go? From (1,1), after eating, head at (1,1), direction would be left or down? When I move to (1,1) from (2,1), I came from right, so direction is L (left).\n> \n> Then from (1,1), possible moves: up to (1,2) but obstacle, invalid; down to (1,0) wall invalid; left to (0,1) wall invalid; right to (2,1) but that's reverse, not allowed. Oh no! Only possible move is right to (2,1), but that's where I came from, and it's reverse direction? Let's see.\n> \n> Current head at (1,1), I moved from (2,1) to (1,1), so I was moving left to get here. So direction is L.\n> \n> Now, from (1,1), moving right to (2,1) is opposite to left, so it is reverse, which is not allowed. And other directions are blocked: up to (1,2) obstacle, down to (1,0) wall, left to (0,1) wall.\n> \n> So no possible moves! That means if I go to (1,1), I die on the next turn because I have no valid move.\n> \n> Oh, big problem! I forgot about that.\n> \n> So (1,1) is a dead end because of obstacles and walls around it.\n> \n> Specifically, (1,1) has only one neighbor: (2,1). (1,2) is obstacle, so not accessible. And (1,0) and (0,1) are walls.\n> \n> So the only adjacent cell is (2,1). Therefore, when head is at (1,1), the only possible move is back to (2,1), but since I came from (2,1), moving back is reverse, which is not allowed. Hence, no valid action, and I collide or something, so death.\n> \n> Therefore, going to (1,1) is suicidal; I must not do that.\n> \n> So option to go down to (2,1) is bad because if I then go to (1,1), I die.\n> \n> I could go to (2,1) but not to (1,1). From (2,1), after moving there on turn 86, I have choices.\n> \n> From (2,1), head at (2,1), direction down (since I moved down from (2,2) to (2,1)).\n> \n> Possible moves: down to (2,0) wall, invalid; left to (1,1) which is food but dead end; right to (3,1); up to (2,2) but reverse, not allowed.\n> \n> So only possible moves: left to (1,1) or right to (3,1).\n> \n> But left to (1,1) leads to death, as above.\n> \n> So only right to (3,1).\n> \n> Then I go to (3,1).\n> \n> But (3,1) might be okay, but I missed the food at (1,1), but since it's a dead end, I can't eat it anyway without dying, so it's not worth it.\n> \n> Food at (1,1) can only be eaten if I can escape, but from (1,1) there is no escape, so it's impossible to eat it safely? Unless I eat it and immediately have a way out, but in this case, no.\n> \n> The only way to eat (1,1) is if after eating, I have a valid move, but from (1,1), no valid moves except reverse, which is illegal. So indeed, (1,1) is inedible; I should avoid it.\n> \n> Similarly, for the food under body, I need to be careful.\n> \n> So for (1,1) food, since it's in a corner with no exit, I cannot eat it without dying, so I should ignore it.\n> \n> Life span 6, but if I can't eat it, no point.\n> \n> Now, back to turn 86, from (2,2), I have two choices, but down to (2,1) is risky because from there I must go to (3,1) to avoid death, but let's see.\n> \n> If I go down to (2,1) on turn 86, then I must go right to (3,1) on turn 87.\n> \n> From (2,1), only choices are left to (1,1) death or right to (3,1). So I go to (3,1).\n> \n> Then on turn 87, head to (3,1), direction right? From (2,1) to (3,1) is moving right, so direction R.\n> \n> Then from (3,1), possible moves: up to (3,2), down to (3,0) wall invalid, left to (2,1) reverse not allowed, right to (4,1).\n> \n> (4,1) is currently the tail, but after moves, it might be different.\n> \n> Let's simulate.\n> \n> Turn 86: move down to (2,1)\n> \n> New snake: head (2,1), body: (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1) tail at (5,1)\n> \n> Tail was (4,1), removed, new tail (5,1)\n> \n> Now, food: (1,1) still there, (6,3) life span now 2? After turn 86, if not eaten, life span decreases.\n> \n> State is at turn 86 before move, so after move, turn 86 complete, life span decreases for all food.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,5) etc.\n> \n> Turn 87: move from (2,1) to (3,1)\n> \n> Head to (3,1), which is empty? (3,1) not occupied before, and no food, so no eat.\n> \n> New snake: head (3,1), body: (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1) tail at (5,1)? When head moves to (3,1), tail moves: old tail (5,1) removed, new tail (6,1)\n> \n> Positions: new head (3,1), then segments: old head (2,1) becomes body, then (2,2), (2,3), ..., up to old (6,1), but (6,1) was index 15, now body, and old tail (5,1) removed, so new tail is (6,1)? Let's list: indices after turn 86: 0:(2,1), 1:(2,2), 2:(2,3), 3:(2,4), 4:(3,4), 5:(3,3), 6:(4,3), 7:(5,3), 8:(5,4), 9:(5,5), 10:(5,6), 11:(6,6), 12:(6,5), 13:(6,4), 14:(6,3), 15:(6,2), 16:(6,1), 17:(5,1) tail.\n> \n> After move to (3,1): new head (3,1), then body: 0 becomes (2,1), 1 becomes (2,2), ..., 16 becomes (6,1), and 17 (5,1) removed.

Also internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4).\n> \n> Snake positions: starting from head: (3,2), then (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1). Tail is (5,1).\n> \n> Food at: (6,3), (1,1), (5,5)\n> \n> (5,5) has food, but (5,5) is occupied by the snake? Snake positions include (5,5), which is the 10th segment? Let's list snake in order:\n> \n> Index: 0: head (3,2)\n> \n> 1: (2,2)\n> \n> 2: (2,3)\n> \n> 3: (2,4)\n> \n> 4: (3,4)\n> \n> 5: (3,3)\n> \n> 6: (4,3)\n> \n> 7: (5,3)\n> \n> 8: (5,4)\n> \n> 9: (5,5)  <-- here is food at (5,5)\n> \n> 10: (5,6)\n> \n> 11: (6,6)\n> \n> 12: (6,5)\n> \n> 13: (6,4)\n> \n> 14: (6,3)  <-- also food at (6,3)\n> \n> 15: (6,2)\n> \n> 16: (6,1)\n> \n> 17: tail (5,1)\n> \n> Food at (6,3) and (5,5). But (6,3) is occupied by the snake at position 14, and (5,5) at position 9.\n> \n> But food can be under the snake body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves onto it later.\n> \n> For (5,5), it's part of the body, so if the snake moves such that the body leaves (5,5) and then head moves there, it can be eaten. Similarly for (6,3).\n> \n> But there's a danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it could cause collision because tail grows and head might hit it.\n> \n> First, let's see possible moves from current position.\n> \n> Current head: (3,2), direction right. So possible moves: U, D, R. L is opposite, not allowed since last move was right.\n> \n> So actions: Up, Down, Right.\n> \n> Now, what are the adjacent cells:\n> \n> - Up: (3,3)\n> \n> - Down: (3,1) but y=0 is wall, so (3,1) might be valid? y=0 is wall, so (3,1) is out of bounds? Borders: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7 are walls. So (3,1): x=3, y=1, y=1 is not 0 or 7, x=3 not 0 or 7, but is it a wall? Borders are the edges, so cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Internal cells are free unless obstacles.\n> \n> (3,1): x=3 between 1-6? x from 0 to 7, so x=0 and x=7 are walls, y=0 and y=7 walls. So (3,1) has y=1, which is not 0, so it should be free unless obstacle. Obstacles are (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4). No (3,1), so (3,1) is free.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,3): is it free? Snake body is at (3,3), which is position 5 in the list. So (3,3) is occupied by body, so cannot move there.\n> \n> (4,2) is right: what is at (4,2)? Snake positions: head (3,2), then (2,2) is behind, but moving right to (4,2). Is (4,2) occupied?\n> \n> Snake segments: (3,2) head, then (2,2), (2,3), etc. (4,2) is not in the list? List: (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3),... so (4,2) is not listed, so it should be free, but let's check for obstacles or walls.\n> \n> (4,2): x=4, y=2, not border wall, obstacles: (5,2) is obstacle, but (4,2) not listed, so should be free.\n> \n> Similarly, down to (3,1): free.\n> \n> Up to (3,3): but (3,3) is snake body, occupied.\n> \n> So possible moves from (3,2):\n> \n> - Up: (3,3) but occupied by snake, invalid\n> \n> - Down: (3,1) free, no wall or obstacle\n> \n> - Right: (4,2) free, no wall or obstacle\n> \n> Left is opposite, not allowed.\n> \n> So only Down or Right are possible.\n> \n> Now, I need to think ahead 5+ turns.\n> \n> Also, food: (6,3) with life span 2, meaning it disappears after turn 87 + 2 = turn 89? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 87, life span 2, so after this turn, it will be 1, then after turn 88, it will be 0 and disappear. So it can be eaten on turn 87 or 88.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,1) life span 5, so disappears after turn 91 (87+4? Let's see: at turn 87, life span 5, after turn 87, it becomes 4, then after 88:3, 89:2, 90:1, 91:0 disappear. So can be eaten up to turn 90.\n> \n> (5,5) life span 8, so at turn 87, life span 8, decreases to 7 after turn 87, so disappears after turn 94 (87+7=94? After turn 87, span=7, after 88:6, ..., after turn 94:0, disappear. Can be eaten up to turn 94.\n> \n> Now, the food at (6,3) is on a body segment, position 14: (6,3). When the snake moves, the tail will move, so if the snake moves away, (6,3) might become free.\n> \n> Similarly for (5,5).\n> \n> But to eat (6,3), since it's under body, we need the body to move away and head to move there.\n> \n> Now, current head at (3,2), (6,3) is far, so not immediately reachable.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,1) is at top-left, (5,5) is near.\n> \n> First, I need to choose move for turn 87.\n> \n> Options: Down to (3,1) or Right to (4,2).\n> \n> If I go right to (4,2), then head at (4,2), direction right.\n> \n> Then from there, possible moves: U, D, R. L is opposite, not allowed.\n> \n> Adjacent cells: (4,3), (4,1), (5,2)\n> \n> (4,3) is snake body? Snake positions: after moving to (4,2), the new head is (4,2), then the body: previous head was (3,2), which becomes body, so snake becomes: [(4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), ...] so (4,3) is occupied by the segment that was previously at (3,3) or something? Let's trace.\n> \n> After move right to (4,2):\n> \n> - Head: (4,2)\n> \n> - Then body: the previous positions minus tail if no food eaten, but no food eaten, so tail moves forward? When snake moves without eating, the head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to previous position, tail is removed.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when moving to a new cell without food, the head occupies the new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, and the tail cell is vacated.\n> \n> So from state: positions [(3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1)]\n> \n> After moving right to (4,2):\n> \n> - New head: (4,2)\n> \n> - Then body: the first body segment is the previous head (3,2), then (2,2), then (2,3), ..., up to the second last, and tail (5,1) is removed? No, the tail is the last segment, (5,1), which will not be occupied anymore.\n> \n> The positions shift: new position 0: (4,2)  (new head)\n> \n> Position 1: old pos 0 = (3,2)\n> \n> Position 2: old pos 1 = (2,2)\n> \n> Position 3: old pos 2 = (2,3)\n> \n> Position 4: old pos 3 = (2,4)\n> \n> Position 5: old pos 4 = (3,4)\n> \n> Position 6: old pos 5 = (3,3)\n> \n> Position 7: old pos 6 = (4,3)\n> \n> Position 8: old pos 7 = (5,3)\n> \n> Position 9: old pos 8 = (5,4)\n> \n> Position 10: old pos 9 = (5,5)\n> \n> Position 11: old pos 10 = (5,6)\n> \n> Position 12: old pos 11 = (6,6)\n> \n> Position 13: old pos 12 = (6,5)\n> \n> Position 14: old pos 13 = (6,4)\n> \n> Position 15: old pos 14 = (6,3)\n> \n> Position 16: old pos 15 = (6,2)\n> \n> Position 17: old pos 16 = (6,1)  -- tail? Old tail was (5,1), which is removed, so the new tail is old pos 16: (6,1)? Let's count.\n> \n> Old positions: 17 segments: indices 0 to 17.\n> \n> After move, head to new cell, so new positions: new index 0: (4,2)\n> \n> Then new index 1: old index 0 (3,2)\n> \n> New index 2: old index 1 (2,2)\n> \n> ...\n> \n> New index 17: old index 16 (6,1)\n> \n> Old index 17 (5,1) is removed.\n> \n> So new snake: [(4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1)]\n> \n> Tail is (6,1)\n> \n> Now, from (4,2), possible moves:\n> \n> - Up: (4,3) - but (4,3) is new position 7, occupied, invalid\n> \n> - Down: (4,1) - is it free? x=4,y=1, not border, not obstacle (obstacles are (5,2), etc, not (4,1)), so free\n> \n> - Right: (5,2) - but (5,2) is an internal obstacle! Given: internal obstacles [(5,2), ...], so (5,2) is wall, cannot move there.\n> \n> - Left: (3,2) - but (3,2) is new position 1, occupied, and also left is opposite to current direction? Current head direction: after moving right, the new direction is right, so moving left would be opposite, not allowed.\n> \n> So only possible move from (4,2) is down to (4,1).\n> \n> Then from there, it might be limited.\n> \n> If I go down from (3,2) to (3,1) on turn 87.\n> \n> Then new head (3,1), direction down.\n> \n> Then snake positions: new head (3,1)\n> \n> Then body: old head (3,2), then (2,2), (2,3), ..., up to old index 16 (6,1), and old tail (5,1) removed.\n> \n> New positions: [(3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1)]\n> \n> Tail is (6,1)\n> \n> From (3,1), possible moves:\n> \n> - Up: (3,2) - occupied by body (new pos 1), invalid\n> \n> - Down: (3,0) - but y=0 is wall, invalid\n> \n> - Left: (2,1) - free? x=2,y=1, not border, not obstacle, free\n> \n> - Right: (4,1) - free, as before\n> \n> And current direction down, so moving up would be opposite, not allowed? Directions: after moving down to (3,1), head direction is down, so moving up is opposite, not allowed. Moving left or right are perpendicular, allowed.\n> \n> So from (3,1), can go left to (2,1) or right to (4,1).\n> \n> Better than going right to (4,2) which only allowed down.\n> \n> So for turn 87, going down to (3,1) seems better because it opens more options.\n> \n> Now, I need to think about food and risks.\n> \n> Food at (6,3) with short life span, only until turn 88.\n> \n> (6,3) is currently occupied by body, but in the snake positions, (6,3) is part of the body.\n> \n> In the new state after any move, it might be different.\n> \n> But to eat (6,3), we need the head to be able to move there when it's free.\n> \n> Currently, at turn 87, (6,3) is occupied, so cannot eat this turn.\n> \n> After turn 87, life span decreases to 1, so it can be eaten on turn 88.\n> \n> If the snake moves such that on turn 88, (6,3) is free and head can move there.\n> \n> Similarly, other food.\n> \n> First, let's see the position of (6,3) in the snake.\n> \n> In current state, (6,3) is position 14: (6,3)\n> \n> After any move, the snake shifts.\n> \n> For example, if we move down to (3,1) on turn 87:\n> \n> New positions: head (3,1), then (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1)\n> \n> So (6,3) is still occupied, at new position 15.\n> \n> After turn 88, if we move again, the snake will shift, and (6,3) might be vacated if the tail moves.\n> \n> Current tail is (6,1), which is at (6,1).\n> \n> When we move on turn 88, the tail (6,1) will be removed, so (6,3) will be occupied by the segment that was before, but let's see the sequence.\n> \n> After turn 87 move down, positions as above.\n> \n> Then on turn 88, we move somewhere.\n> \n> If we move, say, right to (4,1) from (3,1).\n> \n> Then new head: (4,1)\n> \n> Body: (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2)\n> \n> Tail is (6,2), since old tail (6,1) removed.\n> \n> (6,3) is still occupied.\n> \n> If we move left to (2,1) on turn 88 from (3,1), new head (2,1), body (3,1), (3,2), etc., (6,3) occupied.\n> \n> But (6,3) will only be vacated when the segment that is there moves away.\n> \n> In the current position after turn 87 down move, (6,3) is occupied by the segment that was previously at (6,4), which was position 14, now 15.\n> \n> The segment at (6,3) will move to where the previous segment was when the snake moves.\n> \n> For (6,3) to become free, the tail needs to be near, or the snake needs to move in a way that the body leaves (6,3).\n> \n> Currently, the tail is at (6,1), and the body goes from (6,1) to (6,2) to (6,3) to (6,4) etc, so it's a line.\n> \n> To free (6,3), the snake needs to move so that the segment at (6,3) moves to (6,2) or something, but it depends on the head movement.\n> \n> Perhaps it's easier to think that the cell (6,3) will be free when the segment that is there moves to another cell and no new segment comes, but since the snake moves, the segment at (6,3) will move to the next position.\n> \n> For example, if on turn 88, the head moves, the segment at (6,3) will move to where the segment at (6,4) was, and so on.\n> \n> But the position (6,3) will be occupied by the segment that was at (6,4) in the previous state.\n> \n> Let's define the state after turn 87 down move: positions P: [(3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1)]\n> \n> Cell (6,3) is occupied by P[15].\n> \n> On turn 88, when we move the head, the new head is new position, then P[0] moves to new head cell, P[1] moves to P[0], P[2] to P[1], ..., P[17] to P[16], and P[17] is removed.\n> \n> So for cell (6,3), which was occupied by P[15], after move, P[15] moves to P[14]'s position, which is (6,4) in this case, so the new occupant of (6,3) is the segment that was at P[14], which is (6,4) in P, so it moves to (6,3)? Let's index.\n> \n> In state P, positions:\n> Index 0: (3,1)\n> 1: (3,2)\n> 2: (2,2)\n> 3: (2,3)\n> 4: (2,4)\n> 5: (3,4)\n> 6: (3,3)\n> 7: (4,3)\n> 8: (5,3)\n> 9: (5,4)\n> 10: (5,5)\n> 11: (5,6)\n> 12: (6,6)\n> 13: (6,5)\n> 14: (6,4)\n> 15: (6,3)\n> 16: (6,2)\n> 17: (6,1)  tail\n> \n> After a move, say head to (4,1), which is right from (3,1).\n> \n> New head: (4,1)\n> \n> Then new positions:\n> New 0: (4,1)\n> New 1: P[0] = (3,1)\n> New 2: P[1] = (3,2)\n> New 3: P[2] = (2,2)\n> New 4: P[3] = (2,3)\n> New 5: P[4] = (2,4)\n> New 6: P[5] = (3,4)\n> New 7: P[6] = (3,3)\n> New 8: P[7] = (4,3)\n> New 9: P[8] = (5,3)\n> New 10: P[9] = (5,4)\n> New 11: P[10] = (5,5)\n> New 12: P[11] = (5,6)\n> New 13: P[12] = (6,6)\n> New 14: P[13] = (6,5)\n> New 15: P[14] = (6,4)\n> New 16: P[15] = (6,3)\n> New 17: P[16] = (6,2)  tail, P[17] removed\n> \n> So now cell (6,3) is occupied by new P[16] = (6,3), which was old P[15], but the position is the same cell, but the segment that was there moved to (6,4) as new P[15], and new P[16] is from old P[15] which was (6,3), but now it's at new position, which is (6,3) still? New P[16] is old P[15], which was at (6,3), and it moves to the position of new P[15]?

But to eat it, the head needs to move to (6,3) this turn, but currently (6,3) is occupied by body segment 15, which is not the tail; tail is (6,1). If the snake moves, the tail will move, but only if the head eats food, the tail doesn't move, so length increases.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when snake moves, head goes to new position, each segment moves to the next position, and if no food eaten, tail is removed.

Snake positions: head (4,2), body (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), ..., (6,1).

So, I should sketch a grid to visualize this.\n> \n> The grid is 8x8 since x from 0 to 7 and y from 0 to 7. But x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, so the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think? No, x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x from 1 to 6, similarly y from 1 to 6? Let's confirm: \"Border Cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7\" means any cell with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 is a wall. So cells like (0,0), (0,1), ..., (7,7) are all walls if on border. But internal obstacles are given separately.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4). (1,4) and (1,5) are listed, but y=0 to 7, so (1,4) is not border, border is y=0 and y=7, so y=4 is not border, similarly x=1 is not border since x=0 and x=7 are borders. So playable cells are x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except for internal obstacles.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (4,1), direction is D (down). So current head is at (4,1), moving down.\n> \n> Snake body: [(4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2)]\n> \n> That's 18 segments. Let me list them in order: head (4,1), then (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2). Tail is (6,2).\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (1,1) with value 1, life span 4\n> \n> - (5,5) with value 1, life span 6\n> \n> - (4,3) with value 1, life span 9\n> \n> All food has value 1, so all are positive food. No negative food mentioned.\n> \n> Life span: for (1,1), life span 4, meaning it disappears after 4 turns including current turn? \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" so at turn 89, life span 4, so it will disappear after turn 92? Let's see: if current turn is t, and life span N, it disappears after N turns, so after t + N - 1? No.\n> \n> \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so at turn t, life span N, after this turn, it will have N-1 left, and so on, until it reaches 0 and disappears. So it will be present for turns t to t + N - 1, and disappear at turn t + N.\n> \n> For example, at turn t, life span N, it is present. After turn t, life span becomes N-1 for turn t+1, and so on. When life span is 1, it is present for that turn, and disappears before next turn. So it is available from turn t to turn t + N - 1.\n> \n> For food at (1,1): life span 4 at turn 89, so available on turns 89, 90, 91, 92. Disappears after turn 92.\n> \n> (5,5): life span 6, available turns 89 to 94.\n> \n> (4,3): life span 9, available turns 89 to 97.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (4,1), direction down. Moving down would go to (4,0), but y=0 is wall, so moving down is impossible. Direction is D, but (4,1) moving down to (4,0) is wall, so I must change direction to avoid wall.\n> \n> Current head position (4,1), moving down would be to (4,0), but y=0 is border wall, so it's invalid. Therefore, I cannot move down; it would be a wall collision.\n> \n> Similarly, left to (3,1)? Let's see possible moves.\n> \n> From (4,1), possible directions:\n> \n> - Up: to (4,2) but (4,2) is occupied by the snake body? Snake positions: head (4,1), then (4,2) is the next segment, so moving up to (4,2) would be body collision, since it's the second segment.\n> \n> \"Body collision (head touches any body segment)\" — but there's an exception for the tail, but only if it moves and the tail moves away.\n> \n> Specifically, moving to a cell occupied by the body is deadly, except that you can move into the tail cell because the tail will move, so it's safe if it's the tail.\n> \n> In this case, from (4,1), possible moves:\n> \n> - Left: to (3,1)\n> \n> - Right: to (5,1)\n> \n> - Down: to (4,0) — wall, invalid\n> \n> - Up: to (4,2) — occupied by snake body segment (4,2), which is not the tail; tail is at (6,2). (4,2) is the second segment, so moving up would collide with body.\n> \n> So only possible moves are left to (3,1) or right to (5,1).\n> \n> Now, (3,1): is it free? Snake positions: let's list all occupied cells.\n> \n> Snake: (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2)\n> \n> So (3,1) is not in this list, so it should be free, unless there's a wall or obstacle.\n> \n> Walls: borders and internal obstacles. Internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4)\n> \n> (3,1) is x=3,y=1, which is not border (since y=1 not 0), and not in internal obstacles, so it should be free.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,1): x=5,y=1, not border, not in obstacles, and not in snake positions, so free.\n> \n> Now, direction: current head direction is D (down), but since I can't move down, I need to choose left or right.\n> \n> Also, \"no instant reverse\": since current direction is down, I cannot move up on the next turn, but since I'm not moving down, moving left or right is fine, as they are not opposite to down? Opposite would be up, I think.\n> \n> Directions: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), L (left, x-1), R (right, x+1).\n> \n> Current direction D, so opposite is U. I cannot move U immediately, but moving L or R is allowed since not opposite.\n> \n> So from (4,1), possible actions: L to (3,1) or R to (5,1).\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score, avoiding risks, prioritizing long-term survival.\n> \n> Food available:\n> \n> - (1,1): value 1, life span 4, available until turn 92 (turns 89,90,91,92)\n> \n> - (5,5): value 1, life span 6, available until turn 94\n> \n> - (4,3): value 1, life span 9, available until turn 97\n> \n> (4,3) is occupied by the snake body! Look at snake positions: (4,3) is the 9th segment, counting from head: (4,1)=1, (4,2)=2, (3,2)=3, (2,2)=4, (2,3)=5, (2,4)=6, (3,4)=7, (3,3)=8, (4,3)=9, etc.\n> \n> So (4,3) is currently occupied by the snake body.\n> \n> But food at (4,3) is present. The rules say: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if the body moves away, and the head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> So since (4,3) is occupied by body, I can only eat it if that segment moves away, and then head moves there.\n> \n> Currently, at turn 89, food at (4,3) is under the snake, so I need to move such that the snake body moves off (4,3), then later head can move there to eat it.\n> \n> Similarly, other food: (1,1) is free, I think? Let's check if occupied.\n> \n> (1,1): not in snake positions, not wall, not obstacle, so free.\n> \n> (5,5): is it occupied? Snake has (5,5) as the 12th segment? Positions: (5,3)=10, (5,4)=11, (5,5)=12, yes, (5,5) is occupied by snake body.\n> \n> Food at (5,5) is also under the body.\n> \n> Both (4,3) and (5,5) are under snake body, so I need to move the snake to free those cells first before eating.\n> \n> Only (1,1) is currently free and accessible.\n> \n> Now, life spans: (1,1) has short life, only until turn 92, so 4 turns including current.\n> \n> Turn 89: available, after turn 89, life span 3 for turn 90, and so on, disappears after turn 92, so last chance to eat is turn 92.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,5) life span 6, available until turn 94.\n> \n> (4,3) life span 9, until turn 97.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan actions for turns 89,90,91,92,93,... at least 5 turns.\n> \n> First, at turn 89, from (4,1), I can go left to (3,1) or right to (5,1).\n> \n> Let me consider the grid.\n> \n> I should sketch a grid. Let me make a simple text grid.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7, but walls on borders and internal obstacles.\n> \n> Playable area: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, except obstacles.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4)\n> \n> (1,4) and (1,5) are obstacles, so row y=1: x=1 to 6 except possible obstacles? (1,2) is obstacle, but (1,2) is x=1,y=2, not y=1.\n> \n> List obstacles:\n> \n> - (5,2): x=5,y=2\n> \n> - (4,4): x=4,y=4\n> \n> - (1,2): x=1,y=2\n> \n> - (1,5): x=1,y=5\n> \n> - (1,4): x=1,y=4\n> \n> So for y=1, no obstacles, cells (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1) should be free except for snake.\n> \n> But (4,1) is snake head.\n> \n> At turn 89, head at (4,1).\n> \n> Possible moves: L to (3,1) or R to (5,1).\n> \n> (3,1) and (5,1) are both free.\n> \n> Now, let's think about getting to food.\n> \n> (1,1) is at (1,1), which is left and down from current? (4,1) to (1,1): x decreases by 3, y same.\n> \n> But there is obstacle at (1,2), and (1,4), (1,5), but (1,1) is free.\n> \n> From (4,1), moving left to (3,1) gets closer to (1,1), but I need to go to (1,1), which is west.\n> \n> But moving left to (3,1) is one step.\n> \n> Then from (3,1), I can go left to (2,1), then to (1,1), but is (2,1) free? Snake positions: let's see, (2,2) is snake, (2,3), (2,4) are snake, but (2,1) is not listed, so should be free.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,1) free.\n> \n> But there is an obstacle at (1,2), which is above (1,1), so (1,1) is accessible from below or right.\n> \n> Since y=1 is the bottom row, and walls below, so from (1,1), I can only go up or right, but up to (1,2) is obstacle, so from (1,1), only possible move is right to (2,1), since left to (0,1) wall, down to (1,0) wall.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,1) can go left to (1,1), right to (3,1), or up to (2,2).\n> \n> (2,2) is snake body, occupied.\n> \n> So to reach (1,1), I need to go to (2,1) first, then to (1,1).\n> \n> Currently at (4,1), if I go left to (3,1), then to (2,1), then to (1,1). That's three moves: turn 89: L to (3,1), turn 90: L to (2,1), turn 91: L to (1,1), and I can eat it at turn 91, since life span until 92, so turn 91 is fine.\n> \n> Turn 91: move to (1,1), eat food.\n> \n> But I need to consider if it's safe.\n> \n> After eating, snake grows, so length increases by 1.\n> \n> But also, I need to think about the path.\n> \n> Moving right to (5,1) might be another option, but (5,1) is further from (1,1).\n> \n> (5,1) to (1,1) is longer, and I might not reach in time for (1,1) which has short life.\n> \n> Life span 4, available until turn 92, so I can reach by turn 91 or 92.\n> \n> But let's see other food.\n> \n> There is food at (5,5) under body, and (4,3) under body.\n> \n> (4,3) is currently occupied, and it's close to head, but I need to move so that the body moves away.\n> \n> Similarly for (5,5).\n> \n> Also, tail is at (6,2), and head is at (4,1), not adjacent.\n> \n> \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> But currently, tail at (6,2), head at (4,1), not adjacent; adjacent would be same or neighbor cell.\n> \n> (4,1) and (6,2) are not adjacent; distance |4-6|=2, |1-2|=1, so not adjacent.\n> \n> Adjacent means sharing edge, so neighbors: (4,1) neighbors are (4,2), (4,0), (3,1), (5,1).

No.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when head moves to new cell, the tail end is removed if no food eaten, but when food eaten, tail doesn't move, so snake grows.\n> \n> But for now, no food eaten, so when head moves to new cell, the last segment (tail) is removed, so the snake effectively moves forward.\n> \n> In terms of positions: new head at new position, then the previous head position becomes the new neck position, and so on, up to the previous second last position becomes the new tail.\n> \n> For example, positions: index 0: head, 1,2,3,...,17 tail.\n> \n> After move without eating, new head at new pos, new pos[1] = old pos[0], new pos[2] = old pos[1], ..., new pos[k] = old pos[k-1] for k=1 to 17, but since length same, the last position old pos[17] is vacated.\n> \n> So new positions: new head, then old head, then old pos[1], old pos[2], ..., up to old pos[16], and old tail (pos[17]) is removed.\n> \n> In this case, snake has 18 segments, so indices 0 to 17.\n> \n> After moving head to new cell, say (3,1), new positions: head at (3,1), then segment 1: old head (4,1), segment 2: old segment 1 (4,2), segment 3: old segment 2 (3,2), segment 4: old segment 3 (2,2), and so on, up to segment 18: old segment 17, which was (6,2)?

It's turn 90, and I'm playing Snake on a 7x7 grid since the borders are x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7. That means the grid is 8x8? Let's confirm: x from 0 to 7 inclusive is 8 cells, similarly for y. So grid size is 8x8.\n> \n> Walls: Border cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Also internal obstacles at (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4). So I need to avoid these cells.\n> \n> Snake positions: Head is at (5,1), and direction is R (right). The body segments follow: (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3). That's 18 segments, so the snake is quite long.\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (1,1) with value 1 and life span 3\n> \n> - (5,5) with value 1 and life span 5\n> \n> - (4,3) with value 1 and life span 8\n> \n> All food has value 1, so positive food. But I need to be careful with the one at (4,3) because it's under the snake's body?

So (4,3) is occupied by the snake body. But food at (4,3) is listed, so it must be spawned under the body. According to rules, I can only eat it if the body moves away and head moves there. Since it's under the body now, I need to have the snake move so that (4,3) is vacated, then head can go there.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (5,5): snake has (5,5) as the 13th segment? Positions: (5,1) head, then (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), ... so (5,5) is occupied by snake body. Food at (5,5) is also under the body.\n> \n> Food at (1,1) might not be under snake; let's see if (1,1) is in snake positions. Snake positions start from (5,1) to (6,3), no (1,1), so (1,1) is free.\n> \n> Current head position: (5,1), direction right.\n> \n> From (5,1), possible moves: since direction is R, I can go R (right) to (6,1), U (up) to (5,2), D (down) to (5,0), but y=0 is wall, so down is invalid. L (left) to (4,1), but (4,1) is the second segment, and moving left would go to (4,1), which is the neck, but since the tail will move, it might be ok, but let's see the rules.\n> \n> Rules: I can move into the cell occupied by the tail segment because the tail moves. But (4,1) is not the tail; tail is at (6,3). The segments: head (5,1), then (4,1) is next, so if I move left to (4,1), I would be moving into the neck, which is immediately behind head, so that would cause collision because head touches body? But according to movement, since the tail moves, only if it's not the immediate body part.\n> \n> Standard snake rules: moving into the cell that will be vacated by the tail is ok, but moving into a body cell that isn't the tail causes collision.\n> \n> Let me read the rules carefully.\n> \n> \"**Deadly Collisions**: Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, moving to a cell that is currently occupied by the tail is ok, because when the snake moves, the tail leaves that cell. But moving to a cell occupied by any other body segment causes collision.\n> \n> In this case, from head (5,1), possible moves:\n> \n> - Right (R) to (6,1): is (6,1) occupied? Snake positions: (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3) are there, but (6,1) not listed, so probably free. Positions: (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), ..., (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3). So (6,1) not in list, and not wall, so should be free.\n> \n> - Up (U) to (5,2): (5,2) is a wall? Internal obstacle: (5,2) is listed as internal obstacle? Walls: internal obstacles [(5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4)]. So (5,2) is a wall, so cannot go there.\n> \n> - Down (D) to (5,0): but y=0 is border wall, so invalid.\n> \n> - Left (L) to (4,1): (4,1) is the second segment of the snake, directly behind head. Since it's not the tail, moving there would cause head to touch body, collision.\n> \n> Therefore, from (5,1) with direction R, possible moves are only R to (6,1), since U is wall, D is wall, L is body collision.\n> \n> Is that right? Left to (4,1): (4,1) is occupied by snake body, and it's not the tail, so yes, collision.\n> \n> So only possible move is Right to (6,1).\n> \n> But let's confirm the grid.\n> \n> Grid: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. (5,1) is valid.\n> \n> (6,1): x=6, y=1. Borders: x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x=6 is not border, y=1 not border. Internal walls: (5,2) is wall, but (6,1) not listed as wall. Snake positions: no (6,1), so it should be free.\n> \n> Food: no food at (6,1), I think.\n> \n> Food positions: (1,1), (5,5), (4,3).

Since current turn 90, it will disappear after turn 90 + 3 - 1? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 90, life span is 3, so it decreases to 2 at turn 91, 1 at turn 92, and gone at turn 93. So must be eaten by turn 92.\n> \n> Life span: \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So if life span is S at turn T, it will be gone at turn T + S - 1? Let's think.\n> \n> If at turn T, life span is S, then:\n> \n> - After turn T, countdown becomes S-1\n> \n> - After turn T+1, countdown S-2\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - After turn T + (S-1), countdown 0, and it disappears before turn T+S?

Tail is currently at (6,3), which will move to the next position? When snake moves, head goes to new position, each segment moves to the previous position of the segment in front, and the tail segment is removed if no food eaten.\n> \n> Since no food eaten in this move, because (6,1) has no food, so tail is removed.\n> \n> Current snake: 18 segments.\n> \n> After moving to (6,1), the new head is (6,1).

After moving to (6,6), the tail will move, so (6,5) might be free or not.\n> \n> But let's not go there yet.\n> \n> If I go L to (5,5) on turn 96.\n> \n> (5,5) is free, as we said.\n> \n> Then from there, I can go to other places.\n> \n> But I need to get to (4,3) to eat the food, but it's under body.\n> \n> The body at (4,3) is seg14, which is not near the tail, so it will take many moves to vacate it.\n> \n> The snake is long, 16 segments now? After turn 95, 16 segments.\n> \n> To vacate (4,3), I need to move the snake so that the segment at (4,3) moves away, which will happen as the snake moves, but it might take time.\n> \n> Perhaps I can move in a way to shorten the path or something.\n> \n> Since the food at (4,3) has to be eaten by turn 97, at turn 96 countdown 2, turn 97 countdown 1, gone after turn 97, so must eat on turn 96 or 97.\n> \n> At turn 96, (4,3) is occupied by seg14, so I cannot eat it now. Even if I move, (4,3) is still occupied until the snake moves.\n> \n> When the snake moves, if no food eaten, the tail moves away, but the body at (4,3) will move to the next position only if the snake moves and that segment is not fixed.\n> \n> In the movement, each segment moves to the previous position of the segment in front.\n> \n> So for (4,3) to be vacated, the segment that is at (4,3) must move to where seg13 was or something.\n> \n> At turn 96, if I move the head to a new position, the body will shift, so the cell (4,3) will be vacated if the segment that was there moves to a different cell.\n> \n> In current state at turn 96 start, head at (6,5), positions include (4,3) at seg14.\n> \n> If I move head to, say, (5,5) or (6,6), then after move, the body shifts: seg14 will move to where seg13 was, which is (3,3), so (4,3) is vacated.\n> \n> Then, on the next turn, if head moves to (4,3), I can eat it.\n> \n> But head is at (6,5) or wherever after move.\n> \n> At turn 96, after I move, (4,3) is vacated.\n> \n> Then at turn 97, I can move head to (4,3) to eat it, if possible.\n> \n> But (4,3) must be adjacent to head position at turn 97 start.\n> \n> First, let's decide turn 96 action.\n> \n> Option 1: Go U to (6,6)\n> \n> Then head at (6,6), direction U.\n> \n> After move, positions shift: seg14 was at (4,3), moves to where seg13 was, which is (3,3), so (4,3) vacated.\n> \n> New positions: head (6,6), seg1 (6,5) old head, seg2 (6,4) old seg1, ..., and seg14 moves to old seg13 position (3,3), etc.\n> \n> Specifically, old seg13 was (3,3), old seg14 was (4,3), so new seg14 is at old seg13 (3,3), so (4,3) is now free.\n> \n> But head is at (6,6), far from (4,3).\n> \n> Then from (6,6), possible moves: U to (6,7) invalid, R to (7,6) invalid, D to (6,5) which is where seg1 is now, but after move, seg1 is at (6,5), so moving D to (6,5) would collide with body.\n> \n> L to (5,6): is (5,6) free? Current positions: after move, head (6,6), seg1 (6,5), seg2 (6,4), ..., up to tail at (5,4)?

I thought it would be vacated, but no, seg14 moved to (3,3), but seg15 moved to (4,3), so (4,3) is still occupied by snake body, just a different segment.\n> \n> To vacate (4,3), I need the segment there to move away and no other segment to move in, but since the snake is continuous, when it moves, the cell may be occupied by the next segment.\n> \n> Only if (4,3) is the tail, then when snake moves and no food, tail leaves, it vacates.\n> \n> But here, (4,3) is not tail; tail is at (5,3) now.\n> \n> So (4,3) will only be vacated when the segment at (4,3) is the tail and we move without eating food.\n> \n> But currently, it's not tail.\n> \n> For food under body, it can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves there on the same turn or subsequent? Rule: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> It must be that on the turn when head moves to the cell, that cell is not occupied by body, so the body must have moved away on that turn or before.\n> \n> In practice, when the snake moves, the body shifts, so the cell is vacated at the same time as head moves, but only if that cell is not reoccupied immediately.\n> \n> In this case, for (4,3), to eat it, I need that when I move head to (4,3), the cell is free, which requires that the segment that was at (4,3) has moved to a different cell, and no other segment is moving there.\n> \n> That happens when the segment at (4,3) is not the tail, and it moves to the position of the segment in front.\n> \n> But in the shift, the cell is vacated only if it was the tail and we don't grow, otherwise, it might be filled by the next segment.\n> \n> Let's think carefully.\n> \n> Suppose at turn T, cell C is occupied by body segment S.\n> \n> At turn T, we move head to a new position.\n> \n> Then, segment S will move to the position of the segment that was in front of it at T-1.\n> \n> If segment S was not the last segment, then after move, cell C is occupied by the segment that was behind S, because the segments shift.\n> \n> For example, if segment S is at position K, then after move, the new position K is occupied by the segment that was at K-1 at time T-1 (i.e., the one behind).\n> \n> So cell C is still occupied, unless S was the tail.\n> \n> Only when the tail is at C, and we move without eating food, then tail moves away and C is vacated.\n> \n> Otherwise, if a body segment is at C, after move, C is occupied by the previous segment, so it's never free unless the tail was there.\n> \n> For food under body to be eaten, it must be that the food is under the tail, and when the tail moves away, the head can move there on the same turn or next? But the rule says \"the body moves away\" and \"head moves onto the food cell\".\n> \n> In the case where food is under the tail, when the snake moves and no food eaten, the tail moves, so the cell is vacated, and then if head moves to that cell on the same turn, it can eat it, but on the same turn, when you move, the tail moves first or head moves first?\n> \n> The rule doesn't specify the order, but typically in snake, the head moves to a new cell, then each segment moves to the previous position, tail is removed.\n> \n> So when head moves to a cell, if that cell was occupied by the tail, it's ok because tail leaves, so no collision, and if there is food, it can be eaten.\n> \n> But if the cell was occupied by a non-tail body, collision.\n> \n> For food under body, it can only be eaten if it is under the tail and the head moves to the tail cell when the tail moves away.\n> \n> That is, when the food is under the tail, and you move the head to the tail position, then the tail moves away, so the cell is free for head to occupy and eat food.\n> \n> Otherwise, if food is under a non-tail body, it cannot be eaten because that cell will never be free until that segment becomes tail, which may take many moves.\n> \n> In this case, food at (4,3) is under seg14, not tail. Tail is at (5,4) at turn 95.\n> \n> To make (4,3) the tail, I need to have the snake move so that the segment at (4,3) becomes the tail, which means I need to eat food or something to make it the end, but it's complicated.\n> \n> Since the food life span is short, only until turn 97, it might not be possible to eat it.\n> \n> At turn 96, countdown 2, turn 97 countdown 1, so must eat by turn 97.\n> \n> At turn 96 start, (4,3) is occupied by seg14.\n> \n> If I move the head, seg14 will move to where seg13 was, so (4,3) is now occupied by seg15 (which was at (5,3)), so still occupied.\n> \n> Similarly at turn 97, if I move, it might still be occupied.\n> \n> The only way to vacate it is if the segment at (4,3) is the tail and I move without eating.\n> \n> But it's not tail now, and with the short time, I can't make it tail.\n> \n> Therefore, it might be impossible to eat the food at (4,3) because it's under a body segment and not the tail, and with the life span, I can't free it in time.\n> \n> So perhaps I should ignore that food and focus on survival.\n> \n> But there might be other food, but currently no other food listed, only these three, and (1,1) and (5,5) are gone.\n> \n> So no food to eat, so I need to just survive and avoid dying.\n> \n> Back to turn 96, head at (6,5), direction U.\n> \n> I can go U to (6,6) or L to (5,5).\n> \n> If I go U to (6,6), then from (6,6), as before, only possible move is L to (5,6) or D to (6,5) but D is opposite to U, so invalid instant reverse, so only L to (5,6).\n> \n> (5,6): is it free?

So, I should visualize the grid.\n> \n> The grid size isn't specified, but from the walls, it's probably 8x8 since x and y from 0 to 7. x=0 to x=7 means 8 cells wide, similarly for y.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (6,1), then (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4). That's 18 segments. Head direction is right (R).\n> \n> Food:\n> \n> - (1,1) with value 1, life span 2 (so disappears after turn 92? Life span decreases each turn, including current. So at turn 91, life span 2 means it has 2 turns left: after this turn, it will have 1, then gone after turn 92. So must be eaten by turn 92 to get it.)\n> \n> Life span: disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current. So for food at (1,1) with life span 2 on turn 91:\n> \n> - Turn 91: life span 2, can be eaten\n> \n> - After turn 91, life span becomes 1\n> \n> - Turn 92: life span 1, can be eaten\n> \n> - After turn 92, life span 0, disappears\n> \n> So it can be eaten on turn 91 or 92.\n> \n> Similarly for others:\n> \n> - (5,5) value 1, life span 4: can be eaten from turn 91 to 94\n> \n> - (4,3) value 1, life span 7: turns 91 to 97\n> \n> - (3,5) value 1, life span 10: turns 91 to 100\n> \n> All food has value 1, positive.\n> \n> Now, snake head is at (6,1), direction right. So from (6,1), moving right would go to (7,1), but x=7 is a wall, so that's death. Can't go there.\n> \n> Possible moves from (6,1):\n> \n> - Up: (6,1+1) = (6,2)\n> \n> - Down: (6,1-1) = (6,0), but y=0 is wall, so invalid\n> \n> - Left: (6-1,1) = (5,1)\n> \n> - Right: (7,1) wall, invalid\n> \n> But left to (5,1) is the second segment of the snake. Is that a collision?\n> \n> Snake positions: head (6,1), then (5,1) is the neck. If I move left to (5,1), that's where the neck is, but since the snake moves, when head moves to (5,1), the neck will move away to (4,1), so it should be safe because the tail moves. Only if it's not the tail, but in this case, (5,1) is occupied by the body, but after move, head is at (5,1), body shifts, so (5,1) was occupied, but since tail moves, it's ok as long as not colliding with a segment that doesn't move away.\n> \n> Rule: deadly collision if head touches any body segment except that you can move into the tail cell because tail moves.\n> \n> Specifically: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> But (5,1) is not the tail; tail is at (6,4), I think. Snake positions: list has 18 segments, index 0 head (6,1), index 1 (5,1), index 2 (4,1), ..., last is tail (6,4).\n> \n> So if head moves to (5,1), which is currently occupied by index 1. After move, head goes to (5,1), and the body shifts: the segment that was at (5,1) moves to where? When snake moves, each segment moves to the position of the previous segment. So if head moves to a new cell, say to (5,1) from (6,1), then the segment at (5,1) will move to (4,1), and so on, down to tail.\n> \n> But (5,1) is currently occupied, so when head moves to (5,1), at that instant, (5,1) has both head and body? But in terms of collision, it's only collision if head moves to a cell that will still be occupied after the move, except for the tail.\n> \n> Standard snake rules: moving into the cell that was just vacated by the tail is ok, but if it's a body segment that doesn't move away, it's collision.\n> \n> In this case, moving to (5,1): before move, (5,1) has body. After head moves to (5,1), the body segment that was at (5,1) will move to (4,1), so (5,1) is now head, and the old head position is empty. So no collision, because the body moved away.\n> \n> Similarly, only if you move to a cell that is occupied by a segment that won't move, like if it's not the immediate neck or something.\n> \n> Specifically, collision if head touches any body segment except that moving to the tail's current position is safe if the tail moves.\n> \n> Here, (5,1) is the neck, so it should be safe to move there because it will move to (4,1).\n> \n> Similarly, in general, moving to the cell that was occupied by the segment immediately behind the head is safe because that segment moves forward.\n> \n> In this position, from (6,1), moving left to (5,1) should be safe.\n> \n> Moving up to (6,2) might be empty or not.\n> \n> First, let's list all occupied cells by snake.\n> \n> Snake positions: [(6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4)]\n> \n> So cells: (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4)\n> \n> Now, walls: border x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7; internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4)\n> \n> (4,4) is an obstacle, but in snake positions, we have (5,4), etc., no snake at obstacles.\n> \n> Food at: (1,1), (5,5), (4,3), (3,5)\n> \n> (4,3) is food, but snake has a segment at (4,3)? Positions: (4,3) is in the list, index 10: (4,3) is occupied by snake body.\n> \n> Food at (4,3) with life span 7, value 1. But (4,3) is currently occupied by snake, so it can only be eaten if the snake moves away and then head moves back.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,5) is food, and snake has (5,5) in positions? Positions: (5,5) is index 13, occupied by snake body.\n> \n> (5,5) is a body segment.\n> \n> (3,5) is food, and (3,5) is not in snake positions? Snake has (3,4), (3,3), but not (3,5)? Positions: (3,4), (3,3), no (3,5), so (3,5) is empty.\n> \n> (1,1) is food, not occupied.\n> \n> (5,5) occupied, (4,3) occupied.\n> \n> Back to possible moves from head (6,1):\n> \n> - Up: (6,2) - is this free? (6,2) not in snake positions? Positions: (6,1), (5,1), etc., no (6,2). Walls: x=7, y=7, etc., (6,2) not wall. Internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4) — (6,2) not in these, so (6,2) is empty.\n> \n> - Down: (6,0) - y=0 is wall, so invalid.\n> \n> - Left: (5,1) - currently occupied by snake body (index 1). But as discussed, moving there should be safe because the body will move away.\n> \n> - Right: (7,1) - x=7 wall, invalid.\n> \n> So possible moves: Up to (6,2) or Left to (5,1).\n> \n> Now, head direction is R (right). If I move left, that would be opposite to right, which is left. Rule: no instant reverse. Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn. Current direction is R, so moving left (L) would be opposite, so not allowed.\n> \n> Cannot move left because it's reverse.\n> \n> So only possible move is Up to (6,2).\n> \n> Is that right? Current direction is R, meaning last move was to the right, so from (5,1) to (6,1), direction right.\n> \n> Now, from (6,1), moving left to (5,1) would be back the way it came, which is reverse, so not allowed.\n> \n> Moving up or down are perpendicular, not reverse. Reverse only for opposite direction.\n> \n> So yes, only possible move is Up to (6,2), since down is wall.\n> \n> So for turn 91, I must move U to (6,2).\n> \n> But let's confirm: actions are for the current turn, turn 91.\n> \n> After moving, the snake will be at new positions.\n> \n> But I need to think ahead for 5+ turns.\n> \n> First, for turn 91, action must be U.\n> \n> Then, after that, head is at (6,2).\n> \n> Now, direction is now U (since moved up).\n> \n> Then for turn 92, possible moves from (6,2).\n> \n> First, what is the state after turn 91 move.\n> \n> Current turn 91, snake moves U to (6,2).\n> \n> New head position: (6,2)\n> \n> Then body: the segment that was at (5,1) moves to (6,1)? Let's update positions.\n> \n> Old positions: head (6,1), then (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), ..., tail (6,4)\n> \n> After move U: head moves to (6,2), then the body: the first body segment (5,1) moves to the old head position (6,1)? No.\n> \n> In snake movement, when head moves to a new cell, each subsequent segment moves to the position of the previous segment in the list.\n> \n> So positions list: indices 0:head, 1:neck, 2:next, etc., 17:tail.\n> \n> After move, new head at new position, then segment 1 moves to where segment 0 was, segment 2 moves to where segment 1 was, ..., segment 17 moves to where segment 16 was.\n> \n> So here, segment 0 (head) moves to (6,2)\n> \n> Then segment 1 moves to position of old segment 0: (6,1)\n> \n> Segment 2 moves to position of old segment 1: (5,1)\n> \n> Segment 3 moves to (4,1)  // old segment 2\n> \n> Segment 4 moves to (4,2)  // old segment 3\n> \n> Segment 5 moves to (3,2)  // old segment 4\n> \n> Segment 6 moves to (2,2)  // old segment 5\n> \n> Segment 7 moves to (2,3)  // old segment 6\n> \n> Segment 8 moves to (2,4)  // old segment 7\n> \n> Segment 9 moves to (3,4)  // old segment 8\n> \n> Segment 10 moves to (3,3)  // old segment 9\n> \n> Segment 11 moves to (4,3)  // old segment 10\n> \n> Segment 12 moves to (5,3)  // old segment 11\n> \n> Segment 13 moves to (5,4)  // old segment 12\n> \n> Segment 14 moves to (5,5)  // old segment 13\n> \n> Segment 15 moves to (5,6)  // old segment 14\n> \n> Segment 16 moves to (6,6)  // old segment 15\n> \n> Segment 17 (tail) moves to (6,5)  // old segment 16\n> \n> Old segment 16 was (6,6)?

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State\n\nFirst, let's summarize the current state at Turn 92:\n\n- **Grid Dimensions**: 8x8 (x and y range from 0 to 7)\n- **Walls**:\n  - Borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7\n  - Internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4)\n- **Snake**:\n  - Positions: Head at (6,2), followed by body segments down to tail at (6,5)\n  - Current direction: Up (since the snake moved from (6,1) to (6,2))\n- **Food**:\n  - (1,1): value +1, life span 1\n  - (5,5): value +1, life span 3\n  - (4,3): value +1, life span 6\n  - (3,5): value +1, life span 9\n\n### Immediate Possible Moves at Turn 92\n\nFrom the head position (6,2) with current direction Up, the possible moves are:\n\n1. **Up (U)**: to (6,3)\n   - Check:\n     - Not a wall: (6,3) is within bounds and not an internal obstacle.\n     - Not occupied by snake body: (6,3) is not in the snake's current positions.\n     - Valid move.\n\n2. **Down (D)**: to (6,1)\n   - Check:\n     - Opposite direction (from Up to Down): Not allowed (no instant reverse).\n     - Even if allowed, (6,1) is the second segment of the snake, so moving there would cause a collision.\n     - Invalid move.\n\n3. **Left (L)**: to (5,2)\n   - Check:\n     - (5,2) is an internal obstacle.\n     - Invalid move.\n\n4. **Right (R)**: to (7,2)\n   - Check:\n     - x=7 is a border wall.\n     - Invalid move.\n\n**Conclusion**: The only possible move at Turn 92 is **Up (U)** to (6,3).\n\n### Verifying the Only Move\n\nLet's confirm that moving Up is indeed the only safe move:\n\n- **Up to (6,3)**:\n  - New head position: (6,3)\n  - Body segments shift: The tail (6,5) is removed, and the new tail is (6,6).\n  - No collision with walls or body.\n  - Safe move.\n\nOther directions lead to collisions or are invalid due to movement constraints.\n\n### Considering Food\n\nAt Turn 92, the food items are:\n\n1. **(1,1)**: Life span 1\n   - Will disappear after this turn if not eaten.\n   - Currently at a distance; cannot be reached in one move.\n   - Will disappear; ignore.\n\n2. **(5,5)**: Life span 3\n   - Occupied by the snake's body (segment at (5,5)).\n   - Cannot be eaten immediately; need to move the body away first.\n   - Will disappear after Turn 94 if not eaten.\n\n3. **(4,3)**: Life span 6\n   - Also occupied by the snake's body.\n   - Will disappear after Turn 97 if not eaten.\n\n4. **(3,5)**: Life span 9\n   - Not occupied by the snake.\n   - Can be eaten if the head moves there in future turns.\n   - Will disappear after Turn 100 if not eaten.\n\nGiven that the only immediate move is Up, the snake cannot reach any food this turn. The food at (1,1) will disappear after this turn, and the others will remain for a few more turns.\n\n### Planning Future Moves\n\nAfter moving Up at Turn 92, the snake's head will be at (6,3), direction Up. Let's plan the next few moves to reach the accessible food at (3,5):\n\n1. **Turn 92**: U to (6,3)\n2. **Turn 93**: From (6,3), possible moves:\n   - U to (6,4) - Free\n   - D to (6,2) - Body collision (second segment)\n   - L to (5,3) - Body collision\n   - R to (7,3) - Wall\n   - Only possible move: U to (6,4)\n3. **Turn 94**: From (6,4), possible moves:\n   - U to (6,5) - Free\n   - D to (6,3) - Body collision\n   - L to (5,4) - Body collision\n   - R to (7,4) - Wall\n   - Only possible move: U to (6,5)\n4. **Turn 95**: From (6,5), possible moves:\n   - U to (6,6) - Free\n   - D to (6,4) - Body collision\n   - L to (5,5) - Contains food, but is the tail; eating it would cause collision (Tail Reward Danger)\n   - R to (7,5) - Wall\n   - Only safe move: U to (6,6)\n5. **Turn 96**: From (6,6), possible moves:\n   - U to (6,7) - Wall\n   - D to (6,5) - Body collision\n   - L to (5,6) - Free\n   - R to (7,6) - Wall\n   - Only possible move: L to (5,6)\n6. **Turn 97**: From (5,6), possible moves:\n   - U to (5,7) - Wall\n   - D to (5,5) - Free (food at (5,5) has disappeared by now)\n   - L to (4,6) - Free\n   - R to (6,6) - Body collision\n   - Choose L to (4,6) to head towards (3,5)\n7. **Turn 98**: From (4,6), possible moves:\n   - U to (4,7) - Wall\n   - D to (4,5) - Free\n   - L to (3,6) - Free\n   - R to (5,6) - Body collision\n   - Choose D to (4,5) to get closer to (3,5)\n8. **Turn 99**: From (4,5), possible moves:\n   - U to (4,6) - Body collision\n   - D to (4,4) - Obstacle at (4,4)\n   - L to (3,5) - Free, contains food\n   - R to (5,5) - Free but no food\n   - Choose L to (3,5) to eat the food\n\n### Final Action Sequence\n\nBased on the above reasoning, the immediate action at Turn 92 is to move Up. The subsequent moves are planned to navigate towards the food at (3,5) safely.\n\nHowever, since the task is to decide the immediate action for the current Turn (t0 = 92), the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{U}",
        "state": "**Current Turn**: \\( t_0 = 92 \\)\n**Cells occupied by walls**:\n\t - Border Cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7.\n\t - Internal Obstacles: [(5, 2), (4, 4), (1, 2), (1, 5), (1, 4)]\n**Snake Positions**:[(6, 2), (6, 1), (5, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (3, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (3, 3), (4, 3), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 6), (6, 5)]\n**Snake Head Direction**: U\n**Food Positions, Life Span and Value**:\n\t- (1, 1, 1, 1)\n\t- (5, 5, 3, 1)\n\t- (4, 3, 6, 1)\n\t- (3, 5, 9, 1)\n> **Guidance from a Previous Thinking Model:** Turn \\( t_1 = 92 \\)\n> <think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 92. The grid has walls: border cells at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and internal obstacles at (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), and (1,4). So, those are blocked and I can't move there.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (6,2), then (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5). That's 18 segments. Head is at (6,2) and direction is Up, which makes sense since from (6,1) to (6,2) is Up.\n> \n> Food:\n> \n> - (1,1): value 1, life span 1\n> \n> - (5,5): value 1, life span 3\n> \n> - (4,3): value 1, life span 6\n> \n> - (3,5): value 1, life span 9\n> \n> All food has value +1, so positive food. Life span indicates how many turns left, including current turn, so (1,1) disappears after this turn if not eaten.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan an action sequence for at least 5 turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n> \n> First, let's map the grid. It's 8x8? x and y from 0 to 7, so yes, 8x8 grid.\n> \n> Walls: borders are solid, so x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are out of bounds. Internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4). So (1,4) and (1,5) are obstacles, but (1,1) is food, and (1,2) is obstacle, so row y=1 has (1,1) food and (1,2) obstacle, so I can go to (1,1) but not (1,2).\n> \n> Similarly, (4,4) obstacle, (5,2) obstacle.\n> \n> Snake head at (6,2), direction Up.

So possible moves: Up, Left, Right. Down is opposite, so not allowed.\n> \n> Now, check what's around (6,2):\n> \n> - Up: (6,3) – is this free? Let's see.\n> \n> Snake positions: (6,2) head, (6,1) is body, (5,1), etc. (6,3) is not in the snake positions list, so it should be free, but let's confirm.\n> \n> List all snake positions: [(6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5)]\n> \n> So (6,3) is not listed, so empty? But (5,3) is there, which is different cell.\n> \n> (6,3): x=6,y=3. Not in list, so should be free.\n> \n> Similarly, (7,2) is x=7, which is border wall, so out of bounds.\n> \n> (5,2) is internal obstacle, so can't go there.\n> \n> (6,1) is snake body, but since it's the tail, it might move, but for collision, head cannot touch body except the tail cell under certain conditions.\n> \n> General rule: if head moves to a cell that will be occupied by body after move, it collides, except if it's the tail and the tail moves away.\n> \n> But let's think carefully.\n> \n> After moving, the new head position should not be in the body positions except the current tail, which will be vacated.\n> \n> In this case, current tail is (6,5), I think? Positions: head (6,2), then ... (6,6), (6,5). Last one is (6,5), so tail is (6,5).\n> \n> After moving, the tail moves forward, so the cell that was tail is freed, but other body cells stay.\n> \n> So from (6,2), possible moves:\n> \n> - Up to (6,3): what is there? Not snake, not wall? y=3, x=6. Walls: border x=7 or y=7, so (6,3) is within bounds. Internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4) — none at (6,3). Snake: not occupied. So (6,3) should be free.\n> \n> - Down to (6,1): but (6,1) is the second segment, which is body. After move, if I go down to (6,1), but (6,1) will be the new head position? Current positions: head (6,2), body (6,1), (5,1), etc. If I move down to (6,1), that cell is currently occupied by the second segment. After move, the snake moves: new head at (6,1), but (6,1) was the position of the second segment, which is now the head, and the body follows. But at the time of move, head is moving to a cell that is occupied, so it should collide unless it's the tail.\n> \n> Specifically, if the head moves to a cell that is part of the body except the tail, it collides. Here, (6,1) is not the tail; tail is (6,5). (6,1) is the second segment, so moving to (6,1) would cause collision with body.\n> \n> Therefore, cannot move Down.\n> \n> - Left to (5,2): but (5,2) is an internal obstacle, so wall, cannot move there.\n> \n> - Right to (7,2): x=7 is border wall, cannot move.\n> \n> So from (6,2), with current direction Up, possible moves:\n> \n> - Up: to (6,3) — seems free\n> \n> - Down: not possible, reverse and occupied\n> \n> - Left: to (5,2) — obstacle\n> \n> - Right: to (7,2) — wall\n> \n> Therefore, only possible move is Up to (6,3).\n> \n> But is that right? Left is (5,2), which is obstacle, yes. Right is (7,2), wall. Down not possible. So only Up is possible?\n> \n> But let's confirm the snake positions. After moving Up to (6,3), the new head is (6,3), then the body will be: (6,2) becomes second segment, then (6,1), (5,1), and so on, and tail (6,5) moves to where? Current tail is (6,5), and since we're moving, the tail moves forward to the next position in the path.\n> \n> The snake will shift: new head at (6,3), then the previous positions from head to one before tail: so (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), and tail was (6,5), but when head moves, tail moves off (6,5) to whatever the next is, but since it's a list, the last element is removed, and new head added.\n> \n> So after moving Up, new positions: head (6,3), then (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6). (6,5) is gone, and (6,6) is now part of body, not tail anymore? Let's count.\n> \n> Original positions: 18 segments. After move, we add new head and remove tail, so still 18 segments? No: when snake eats, it grows, but here no food, so length same, so we add new head and remove tail.\n> \n> Original: head (6,2), then 17 body segments down to tail (6,5).\n> \n> Positions: index 0: head (6,2), 1: (6,1), 2: (5,1), 3: (4,1), 4: (4,2), 5: (3,2), 6: (2,2), 7: (2,3), 8: (2,4), 9: (3,4), 10: (3,3), 11: (4,3), 12: (5,3), 13: (5,4), 14: (5,5), 15: (5,6), 16: (6,6), 17: (6,5) tail.\n> \n> After moving Up, new head at (6,3), then positions become: [ (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6) ] and tail (6,5) is removed, so (6,6) is now the tail? (6,6) was index 16, now it's the last, so tail at (6,6).\n> \n> But (6,6) is at the border? y=6, y=7 is wall, but (6,6) is within bounds, y=0 to 7, so (6,6) is ok, but y=7 is wall, so (6,6) is not wall.\n> \n> But in this case, from (6,2), only Up is possible, as per above.\n> \n> But let's see the food: (1,1) has life span 1, so if not eaten this turn, it disappears. But I'm at (6,2), far away, and only can move to (6,3), so I can't eat it this turn. So (1,1) will disappear after this turn.\n> \n> Similarly, other food: (5,5) is occupied by snake? Snake positions include (5,5), which is part of body. (5,5) is in positions: index 14: (5,5).\n> \n> But food at (5,5) is listed.

It's turn 93. The grid has walls: border cells at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7). Internal obstacles at (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4). I should plot this mentally.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (6,3), with direction UP. So moving up means increasing y, I assume? Typically in grids, (0,0) is bottom-left, but since direction is U and positions show y increasing down? Let's see the positions: head (6,3), then (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), etc. From (6,3) to (6,2) to (6,1), that's decreasing y, so y=0 is top? I need to clarify the coordinate system.\n> \n> The movement: U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), L is (x-1,y), R is (x+1,y). And positions: head (6,3), next is (6,2), which is down if y decreases, but U is (x,y+1), so if y+1 is up, then y=0 would be bottom. But in the positions, (6,1) to (5,1) to (4,1), all at y=1, then to (4,2), so y=2 is above y=1? I'm confused.\n> \n> List the snake positions in order: [(6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6)]\n> \n> From (6,3) to (6,2): y decreased by 1, so if U is (x,y+1), that should increase y, so if y increases down, then (6,3) to (6,2) is moving down? But head direction is U, which is up. Contradiction.\n> \n> Head direction is given as U, meaning the snake was moving up to reach (6,3). But from previous position, it came from where? Positions are listed head first, so to get to (6,3), it must have come from below, so from a lower y. Since positions are head at (6,3), then body at (6,2), which is the segment behind, so the snake moved from (6,2) to (6,3) by moving up, so y+1 is up. Therefore, in this coordinate system, y=0 is the bottom, y increases as you go up. So (6,3) to (6,4) would be up, to (6,2) down, etc.\n> \n> In positions: from (6,3) to (6,2) to (6,1), y decreasing, so moving down. But head is at (6,3) with direction U, meaning it just moved up to (6,3). The positions list: index 0 is head, index 1 is the first body segment, which is where the head was last turn. So at turn 92, head was at (6,2), and it moved up to (6,3) at turn 93. Yes, that makes sense. So direction U means it moved up to current position.\n> \n> Current head position: (6,3), direction U, so it can move U, L, R, but not D, because no instant reverse. Possible moves: U (up to (6,4)), L (left to (5,3)), R (right, but x=7 is wall, so R to (7,3) is invalid, x=7 is border wall.\n> \n> Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So grid cells from (1,1) to (6,6)? x from 1 to 6? x=0 and x=7 are walls, so valid x: 1 to 6, y: 1 to 6? y=0 and y=7 walls, so y from 1 to 6.\n> \n> Head at (6,3), x=6, y=3.\n> \n> Possible moves:\n> \n> - U: to (6,4) - y+1=4\n> \n> - D: to (6,2) - but instant reverse?

But (5,3) is not the tail; tail is (6,6). The rule: body collision if head touches any body segment except the tail, because tail moves.\n> \n> Rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment).

Positions: indices 0:(6,3), 1:(6,2), 2:(6,1), then 3:(5,1), etc. up to 17:(6,6). So (6,4) and (6,5) are not occupied, so U to (6,4) should be safe.\n> \n> L to (5,3) is occupied by body at index 13, which is not tail, so collision.\n> \n> Therefore, only possible move is U to (6,4)?

But when the snake moves, the tail moves away, so moving to (5,4) might be possible only if it's the tail and we eat food or something. Generally, moving into a cell that will be vacated by the tail is safe, as long as it's not occupied by other body parts.\n> \n> The rule: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> In this case, (5,4) is not the tail; tail is (5,6). (5,6) is index 17, tail. (5,4) is index 15, which is a body segment, not tail. So moving to (5,4) would cause collision with body.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,5) is empty, so moving there should be fine, unless it's a wall or something, but it's not.\n> \n> Now, food: (5,5) has food, but (5,5) is currently occupied by the snake at index 16: (5,5). And food is at (5,5) with value 1, life span 2.\n> \n> But food can be under the body, and can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves there.\n> \n> Currently, (5,5) has both snake and food. Since life span is 2, it will disappear after 2 turns, including current? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 94, life span 2 means it will disappear at the end of turn 95? Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Life-span disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So for food at (5,5) with life span 2 at turn 94: after turn 94, life span becomes 1; after turn 95, it becomes 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten on turn 94 or 95, but not after.\n> \n> Similarly, other food.\n> \n> Now, back to moves.\n> \n> At turn 94, from (6,4), head direction U, possible moves: Up to (6,5) or Left to (5,4).\n> \n> But (5,4) is occupied by snake body at index 15, so moving there would cause collision, as it's not the tail.\n> \n> Tail is at (5,6).\n> \n> So Left to (5,4) is invalid and deadly.\n> \n> Therefore, only possible move is Up to (6,5).\n> \n> Is that right?\n> \n> (6,5): is it free? Let's confirm.\n> \n> Cells: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n> \n> Walls: borders x=0,7 y=0,7; internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4).\n> \n> (6,5): x=6,y=5. Not a border, not internal obstacle. Snake positions: no (6,5), so yes, free.\n> \n> Moving Up to (6,5) should be safe.\n> \n> Then, after moving, the snake head is at (6,5), and direction becomes Up.\n> \n> Now, for the next turns, I need to plan ahead.\n> \n> Also, food at (6,2) with life span 10, but (6,2) is occupied by snake body at index 2: (6,2). So it can be eaten if the snake moves away and head comes back, but life span 10 is long, so possible later.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,3) has food, but occupied by snake at index 13: (4,3). Life span 4.\n> \n> (3,5) has food, not occupied, life span 7.\n> \n> (5,5) has food and snake, life span 2.\n> \n> First, turn 94: I think I must move Up to (6,5), since Left is invalid.\n> \n> Then, at (6,5), direction U.\n> \n> Now turn 95.\n> \n> From (6,5), direction U, possible moves: Up to (6,6), Down (reverse, not allowed), Left to (5,5), Right to (7,5) but x=7 wall, invalid.\n> \n> So possible: Up or Left.\n> \n> Left to (5,5): (5,5) has food and is occupied by snake body.\n> \n> If I move to (5,5), since there is food, and if the snake body moves away, but at this moment, (5,5) is occupied by index 16.\n> \n> After turn 94 move: if head moves to (6,5), then the new positions:\n> \n> Head moves to (6,5), then body segments follow: index 1 (6,3) moves to where head was (6,4)? Standard snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> So after moving Up to (6,5) at turn 94:\n> \n> New head: (6,5)\n> \n> Then body: segment 1 moves to old head position (6,4)\n> \n> Segment 2 moves to old segment 1 position (6,3)\n> \n> Segment 3 moves to old segment 2 position (6,2)\n> \n> ...\n> \n> Up to tail.\n> \n> Old positions: indices 0 to 17.\n> \n> After move: new position 0: (6,5)  // new head\n> \n> New pos 1: old pos 0 = (6,4)\n> \n> New pos 2: old pos 1 = (6,3)\n> \n> New pos 3: old pos 2 = (6,2)\n> \n> New pos 4: old pos 3 = (6,1)\n> \n> New pos 5: old pos 4 = (5,1)\n> \n> New pos 6: old pos 5 = (4,1)\n> \n> New pos 7: old pos 6 = (4,2)\n> \n> New pos 8: old pos 7 = (3,2)\n> \n> New pos 9: old pos 8 = (2,2)\n> \n> New pos 10: old pos 9 = (2,3)\n> \n> New pos 11: old pos 10 = (2,4)\n> \n> New pos 12: old pos 11 = (3,4)\n> \n> New pos 13: old pos 12 = (3,3)\n> \n> New pos 14: old pos 13 = (4,3)\n> \n> New pos 15: old pos 14 = (5,3)\n> \n> New pos 16: old pos 15 = (5,4)  // this was (5,4) old, now new pos 16\n> \n> Old pos 15 was (5,4), now new pos 16 is that.\n> \n> New pos 17: old pos 16 = (5,5)  // (5,5) was occupied, now new tail is at old pos 16?

No.\n> \n> In snake game, when no food eaten, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves forward, so the tail cell is vacated.\n> \n> Specifically: after moving to (6,5) without eating, the last segment (tail) is removed, so the new snake has the same length, positions from new head to new tail.\n> \n> Old tail was at (5,6), which is vacated.\n> \n> New tail is at what was previously the second last segment.\n> \n> Old positions: 17 segments?

Walls include the borders and internal obstacles at (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), and (1,4).\n> \n> Snake positions: The head is at (6,5), and the direction is Up. The body segments follow: (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5). Let me list these to understand the snake's shape.\n> \n> Positions in order: head (6,5), then (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5). That's 18 segments, so the snake is long.\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (5,5) with value 1, life span 1 (so it disappears after this turn if not eaten)\n> \n> - (4,3) with value 1, life span 3\n> \n> - (3,5) with value 1, life span 6\n> \n> - (6,2) with value 1, life span 9\n> \n> All food has value +1, so positive food.

(6,5) and (5,5) are adjacent horizontally. So head is adjacent to tail.\n> \n> And food at (5,5), so if I move left to (5,5), I would eat the food, but since head is adjacent to tail, and I eat it, the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move, and new tail is at (5,5), but head moves to (5,5), so they collide immediately. Yes, that would be deadly.\n> \n> Therefore, I cannot eat the food at (5,5) this turn because it would cause collision.\n> \n> Moreover, the food at (5,5) has life span 1, meaning after this turn (turn 95), if not eaten, it disappears.

It's turn 96, and I'm playing Snake on a 8x8 grid since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the grid goes from (0,0) to (7,7). Internal obstacles are at (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4).\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (6,6), then body segments: (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4). Let me list them in order:\n> \n> - Head: (6,6)\n> \n> - Segment 1: (6,5)\n> \n> - Segment 2: (6,4)\n> \n> - Segment 3: (6,3)\n> \n> - Segment 4: (6,2)\n> \n> - Segment 5: (6,1)\n> \n> - Segment 6: (5,1)\n> \n> - Segment 7: (4,1)\n> \n> - Segment 8: (4,2)\n> \n> - Segment 9: (3,2)\n> \n> - Segment 10: (2,2)\n> \n> - Segment 11: (2,3)\n> \n> - Segment 12: (2,4)\n> \n> - Segment 13: (3,4)\n> \n> - Segment 14: (3,3)\n> \n> - Segment 15: (4,3)\n> \n> - Segment 16: (5,3)\n> \n> - Segment 17: (5,4)\n> \n> The snake has 18 segments? Let's count: positions from index 0 to 17, that's 18 cells. Head is (6,6), tail is (5,4).\n> \n> Snake head direction is U, which is up. So moving upwards.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (4,3) with value 1 and life_span 3\n> \n> - (3,5) with value 1 and life_span 5\n> \n> - (6,2) with value 1 and life_span 8\n> \n> All food has value +1, so all positive food. No negative food mentioned.\n> \n> Life_span: for (4,3) it's 3, meaning it disappears after 3 turns including current turn? Let's read: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So at turn 96, life_span 3 means it will disappear at the end of turn 98? Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So, for a food with life_span N at turn t, it will be gone after turn t + N - 1? Let's think.\n> \n> If countdown decreases every turn including current, then:\n> \n> - At turn t (current turn), life_span = N\n> \n> - After turn t, life_span becomes N-1\n> \n> - After turn t+1, life_span becomes N-2\n> \n> ...\n> \n> - After turn t + (N-1), life_span becomes 0, and it disappears.\n> \n> So it disappears at the end of turn t + (N-1).\n> \n> For example, food at (4,3) with life_span 3 at turn 96: after turn 96, life_span 2; after turn 97, life_span 1; after turn 98, life_span 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten on turns 96, 97, or 98, but not after.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,5) life_span 5: disappears after turn 100 (96+4=100, since after turn 96:4, 97:3, 98:2, 99:1, 100:0 gone).\n> \n> Turn 96: life_span 5\n> \n> After turn 96: 4\n> \n> After turn 97: 3\n> \n> ...\n> \n> After turn 100: 0, gone. So last chance to eat is turn 100.\n> \n> (6,2) life_span 8: disappears after turn 103.\n> \n> Now, snake head is at (6,6), direction U (up). So possible moves: since direction is U, I can move U, L, or R, but not D because that's reverse. Movement constraints: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\" Current direction is U, so opposite is D, so I cannot move down. Possible moves: U (up), L (left), R (right).\n> \n> Now, let's see the grid to avoid walls and body collisions.\n> \n> Walls: borders x=0,7 y=0,7, so cells like (0,y), (7,y), (x,0), (x,7) are walls. Also internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4).\n> \n> (1,4) and (1,5) are obstacles, but (1,2) is also.\n> \n> Snake body: let's plot the positions to see where I can move.\n> \n> First, head at (6,6). Possible moves:\n> \n> - U: to (6,7). But y=7 is wall, since border y=7 is wall. So (6,7) is out of bounds, wall collision. Cannot move U.\n> \n> - D: but cannot, because reverse of current U. Invalid.\n> \n> - L: to (5,6). What is (5,6)? Is it wall or body?\n> \n> Walls: borders, so (5,6) is not border, x=5 not 0 or 7, y=6 not 0 or 7. Internal obstacles: (5,2) is obstacle, but (5,6) not listed. So (5,6) should be free, but is it occupied by snake?\n> \n> Snake positions: let's list all occupied cells.\n> \n> Snake: (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4)\n> \n> (5,6) is not in this list, so it should be free.\n> \n> - R: to (7,6). But x=7 is border wall, so (7,6) is wall, cannot move there.\n> \n> So possible moves from (6,6) with direction U:\n> \n> - U: to (6,7) - wall, invalid\n> \n> - D: reverse, invalid\n> \n> - L: to (5,6) - seems free\n> \n> - R: to (7,6) - wall, invalid\n> \n> So only possible move is L to (5,6).\n> \n> Is that right? Let me confirm.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. So (6,7) is y=7, which is top wall, so invalid.\n> \n> (7,6) is x=7, right wall, invalid.\n> \n> D is invalid because reverse.\n> \n> So indeed, only L to (5,6) is possible.\n> \n> But let's make sure about (5,6). Is it occupied or obstacle?\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (5,2) is obstacle, but (5,6) is not listed, so not obstacle.\n> \n> Snake positions: no (5,6), so free.\n> \n> Food: (4,3), (3,5), (6,2) - not at (5,6).\n> \n> So at turn 96, I must move L to (5,6).\n> \n> But I need to think multiple turns ahead, as per instructions.\n> \n> First, after moving to (5,6), what is the new state?\n> \n> Turn 96: move L to (5,6)\n> \n> Now snake head was at (6,6), moves to (5,6), so new head position (5,6).\n> \n> The body: since snake moves, the tail moves forward? When snake moves, the head moves to new position, and each segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead.\n> \n> Specifically: the head moves to the new cell, and the tail segment is removed unless food is eaten.\n> \n> In this move, since I'm moving to (5,6), which has no food, so length remains same, tail is removed.\n> \n> Current tail is (5,4), I think.\n> \n> Snake positions: indices: 0: head (6,6), 1: (6,5), 2: (6,4), 3: (6,3), 4: (6,2), 5: (6,1), 6: (5,1), 7: (4,1), 8: (4,2), 9: (3,2), 10: (2,2), 11: (2,3), 12: (2,4), 13: (3,4), 14: (3,3), 15: (4,3), 16: (5,3), 17: (5,4) tail.\n> \n> After moving head to (5,6), new head is (5,6).

Let me count: positions listed: 1.(5,6), 2.(6,6), 3.(6,5), 4.(6,4), 5.(6,3), 6.(6,2), 7.(6,1), 8.(5,1), 9.(4,1), 10.(4,2), 11.(3,2), 12.(2,2), 13.(2,3), 14.(2,4), 15.(3,4), 16.(3,3), 17.(4,3), 18.(5,3). So 18 segments, meaning the snake is quite long.\n> \n> Head direction is L, which is left, so moving towards decreasing x.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (4,3) with value 1, life_span 2\n> \n> - (3,5) with value 1, life_span 4\n> \n> - (6,2) with value 1, life_span 7\n> \n> - (3,2) with value 1, life_span 10\n> \n> All food has value +1, so all positive food. No negative food mentioned, so all are good to eat, but I need to be careful with risks.\n> \n> Life_span: for (4,3), life_span 2, meaning it disappears after 2 turns including current turn? The description says: \"disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So for turn 97, life_span 2 means it will disappear after turn 98? Let's clarify.\n> \n> If life_span is N, and we're at turn t, it disappears after N turns, meaning at turn t + N it's gone? But countdown decreases every turn including current.\n> \n> It says: \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So at turn t, if life_span is L, after this turn, it decreases to L-1, and when it reaches 0, it disappears. So it can be eaten until the turn before it disappears.\n> \n> For example, food with life_span 2 at turn 97: after turn 97, life_span becomes 1; after turn 98, it becomes 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten on turn 97 or 98, but not after.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,3) life_span 2 at turn 97: can be eaten on turn 97 or 98.\n> \n> (3,5) life_span 4: can be eaten from turn 97 to 100.\n> \n> (6,2) life_span 7: turns 97 to 103.\n> \n> (3,2) life_span 10: turns 97 to 106.\n> \n> Now, special cases: food can spawn under snake body, but can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves onto it.\n> \n> Looking at food positions:\n> \n> (4,3) is at (4,3). Snake positions include (4,3) as the 17th segment? List: positions: 1.(5,6), 2.(6,6), 3.(6,5), 4.(6,4), 5.(6,3), 6.(6,2), 7.(6,1), 8.(5,1), 9.(4,1), 10.(4,2), 11.(3,2), 12.(2,2), 13.(2,3), 14.(2,4), 15.(3,4), 16.(3,3), 17.(4,3), 18.(5,3).\n> \n> So (4,3) is occupied by the snake's body segment 17. Similarly, (6,2) is occupied by segment 6? (6,2) is position 6: (6,2).\n> \n> Food at (6,2) with life_span 7. But (6,2) is currently occupied by the snake's body, segment 6.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,2) is occupied by segment 11.\n> \n> (4,3) occupied by segment 17.\n> \n> (3,5) is not occupied by snake? Snake positions: let's see all y=5: only (6,5) at segment 3, and (3,5) is not listed, so (3,5) is free, not under snake.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,2) is occupied, (4,3) occupied, (6,2) occupied.\n> \n> So food at (3,5) is on an empty cell, while others are under snake body.\n> \n> For food under body, like (4,3), (6,2), (3,2), I can only eat it if the body moves away and head moves there.\n> \n> But (3,2) has life_span 10, plenty of time, similarly (6,2) life_span 7, but (4,3) only life_span 2, so it might disappear soon.\n> \n> Now, head is at (5,6), direction L, so last move was left, from (6,6) to (5,6)? Positions: head (5,6), previous was (6,6), and direction L, so moving left to (5,6).\n> \n> Now, possible moves: I can move U, D, L, R, but no instant reverse. Current direction is L, so I cannot move R (right) on the next turn because that would be opposite.\n> \n> So allowed moves: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), L (left, x-1), but not R.\n> \n> Also, need to check walls and collisions.\n> \n> First, let's map the grid.\n> \n> Playable area: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n> \n> Walls: border x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are all walls, so cannot move there.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4)\n> \n> So these cells are blocked.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (5,6). Possible moves from here:\n> \n> - U: up to (5,7), but y=7 is wall, so invalid.\n> \n> - D: down to (5,5), which is playable? y=5, x=5. Is there wall? Internal obstacles: (5,2) is wall, but (5,5) not listed, so should be free. Snake body? Positions: let's see what is at (5,5). Snake has (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), etc., no (5,5) in positions, so (5,5) is empty.\n> \n> - L: left to (4,6), x=4,y=6. Is this wall? Border y=6 not wall, x=4 not wall. Obstacles: (1,2),(1,4),(1,5),(4,4),(5,2) — (4,6) not listed, so should be free. Snake body? Positions: head (5,6), then (6,6), (6,5), etc., no (4,6), so empty.\n> \n> - R: right to (6,6), but (6,6) is the second segment of snake. Head is at (5,6), moving to (6,6) would be into the body. (6,6) is segment 2, which is the neck, so if I move right, head goes to (6,6), which is occupied by body, so collision, death. So invalid move.\n> \n> Also, cannot move R because it's reverse direction? Current direction L, moving R is opposite, so not allowed anyway.\n> \n> So possible moves from (5,6): U to (5,7) wall, invalid; D to (5,5) possible; L to (4,6) possible; R to (6,6) body collision and reverse, invalid.\n> \n> So only D or L.\n> \n> Now, I need to think ahead 5+ turns.\n> \n> Also, food considerations.\n> \n> First, (4,3) has short life, only 2 turns left, including current turn 97. So it can be eaten on turn 97 or 98.\n> \n> But it's under snake body at segment 17, which is (4,3).\n> \n> To eat it, the body must move away, and head must move there.\n> \n> Currently, head is at (5,6), (4,3) is far away.\n> \n> The snake is long, 18 segments.\n> \n> Let me sketch the grid for clarity.\n> \n> Grid rows y=6 to y=1, top to bottom? Usually in grids, y=6 might be top or bottom, but in coordinates, it doesn't matter, but let's define.\n> \n> Assume y=6 is top, y=1 bottom, x=1 left, x=6 right.\n> \n> So head at (5,6) top row.\n> \n> Snake positions: let's list all occupied cells.\n> \n> From positions: (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3)\n> \n> Also, internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4)\n> \n> Walls at borders.\n> \n> Food: (4,3) but occupied, (3,5) free, (6,2) occupied, (3,2) occupied.\n> \n> (3,5) is at (3,5), which is free.\n> \n> Now, life_span: (4,3) must be eaten soon or lost.\n> \n> But to eat (4,3), I need head to go to (4,3) when it's free.\n> \n> Currently occupied by segment 17. When will it move away?\n> \n> The snake moves one step per turn. When the snake moves, the tail moves forward, so segments shift.\n> \n> For example, if I move down to (5,5), the new head is (5,5), and the tail (5,3) moves away? Let's see the tail.\n> \n> Snake positions: tail is (5,3), segment 18.\n> \n> When snake moves, head moves to new position, and tail is removed if no food eaten. Since we're moving, not eating yet, length same.\n> \n> General move: if no food eaten, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to previous position, tail segment is removed.\n> \n> So after move, tail cell is vacated.\n> \n> But for a body segment to vacate, it depends on the movement.\n> \n> Specifically for (4,3), it is segment 17. When the snake moves, segment 17 will move to where segment 16 was, which is (3,3), and so on.\n> \n> Let's simulate.\n> \n> Current positions: index from head: 0: (5,6), 1: (6,6), 2: (6,5), 3: (6,4), 4: (6,3), 5: (6,2), 6: (6,1), 7: (5,1), 8: (4,1), 9: (4,2), 10: (3,2), 11: (2,2), 12: (2,3), 13: (2,4), 14: (3,4), 15: (3,3), 16: (4,3), 17: (5,3)  // I think I miscounted indices.\n> \n> Earlier I listed 18 positions, so indices from 0 to 17? Head is index 0.\n> \n> In the list: position 1: (5,6) head, 2: (6,6), 3: (6,5), 4: (6,4), 5: (6,3), 6: (6,2), 7: (6,1), 8: (5,1), 9: (4,1), 10: (4,2), 11: (3,2), 12: (2,2), 13: (2,3), 14: (2,4), 15: (3,4), 16: (3,3), 17: (4,3), 18: (5,3)  // so 18 positions, index 1 to 18 or 0 to 17? Better to use 0-based.\n> \n> Set head as index 0: (5,6)\n> \n> Index 1: (6,6)\n> \n> Index 2: (6,5)\n> \n> Index 3: (6,4)\n> \n> Index 4: (6,3)\n> \n> Index 5: (6,2)\n> \n> Index 6: (6,1)\n> \n> Index 7: (5,1)\n> \n> Index 8: (4,1)\n> \n> Index 9: (4,2)\n> \n> Index 10: (3,2)\n> \n> Index 11: (2,2)\n> \n> Index 12: (2,3)\n> \n> Index 13: (2,4)\n> \n> Index 14: (3,4)\n> \n> Index 15: (3,3)\n> \n> Index 16: (4,3)  // this is the food cell\n> \n> Index 17: (5,3)  // tail\n> \n> Food at (4,3) is occupied by index 16.\n> \n> When snake moves without eating, head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so index i moves to where index i-1 was.\n> \n> Specifically, after move, the new head is at new position, new index 1 is old head position, new index 2 is old index 1 position, ..., up to new tail is old second-to-last position.\n> \n> For cell (4,3), it is currently occupied by index 16. After one move, if no food eaten, index 16 will move to where index 15 was, which is (3,3). Then (4,3) is vacated only if no new segment comes, but since tail is removed, the cell is free.\n> \n> After move: new head at new pos.\n> \n> New body segment 1 at old head pos (5,6)\n> \n> New body segment 2 at old index 1 pos (6,6)\n> \n> ...\n> \n> New body segment 16 at old index 15 pos (3,3)\n> \n> New body segment 17 at old index 16 pos (4,3)? Old index 16 is (4,3), but since no food, the tail old index 17 (5,3) is removed, so the snake has one less segment? No.\n> \n> Number of segments: if no food eaten, length same, but tail moves.\n> \n> Positions: after move, the new positions are: new head, then old head, old index 1, ..., old index 16, but since no growth, the last segment (old tail) is not included, so the new snake has segments from new head to old second-to-last.\n> \n> Standard: after moving without eating, the tail cell is vacated, and each segment shifts forward.\n> \n> For example, from current:\n> \n> If head moves to new cell, say to (5,5) for example.\n> \n> Then new head: (5,5)\n> \n> New segment 1: old head (5,6)\n> \n> New segment 2: old index 1 (6,6)\n> \n> New segment 3: old index 2 (6,5)\n> \n> ...\n> \n> New segment 17: old index 16 (4,3)\n> \n> But old index 16 is (4,3), and old tail index 17 (5,3) is removed, so no new segment for it. So the snake now has 17 segments, from new head to old index 16.\n> \n> Old positions: indices 0 to 17, 18 segments.\n> \n> After move no eat: new positions: new head, then old index 0, old index 1, ..., old index 16. That's 17 positions, so length decreased by one? No, index 0 to 16 is 17 positions, but old was 0 to 17, 18 positions.\n> \n> Let's count: old positions: 18 cells.\n> \n> After move: head moves to new cell, so new head position.\n> \n> Then the body: the first body segment is at the old head position.\n> \n> Second body at old first body position, and so on, up to the second-to-last body at its new position, and the last body (tail) is removed.\n> \n> So for a snake of length L, after move no eat, new length L-1? But that can't be right; the snake should stay the same length when not eating.\n> \n> I think I have a confusion.\n> \n> In Snake game, when the snake moves without eating food, the head moves to a new cell, the tail cell is vacated, and all body segments move forward, so the snake occupies the same number of cells, but shifted.\n> \n> For example, positions: let's say segments S0, S1, S2, ..., S_{L-1} with S0 head.\n> \n> After move to new cell N, new head is N, new S1 is old S0, new S2 is old S1, ..., new S_{L-1} is old S_{L-2}, and old S_{L-1} is vacated.\n> \n> So the new snake has positions: N, old S0, old S1, ..., old S_{L-2}, so length L, but the last segment is old S_{L-2}, and old S_{L-1} is free.\n> \n> In this case, old snake: indices 0 to 17, so L=18, S0 to S17.\n> \n> After move, new head at new position, new S1 at old S0, new S2 at old S1, ..., new S17 at old S16, and old S17 is vacated.\n> \n> So for cell (4,3), it is old S16. After move, new S17 is at old S16 position, so (4,3) is still occupied by new S17, unless the snake moves in a way that S16 is not the new tail or something.\n> \n> In the new snake, new S17 is at old S16 position, so (4,3) is still occupied by the snake, but by a different segment.\n> \n> Specifically, new S17 is at (4,3), so the cell (4,3) is not vacated; it is still occupied by the snake, but now it's the tail or something.\n> \n> Old S16 at (4,3), after move, new S17 is at old S16 position, so (4,3) is now occupied by new S17, which is the new tail if no growth.\n> \n> Since no growth, new S17 is the tail.\n> \n> So (4,3) is now the tail position.\n> \n> To vacate (4,3), the snake needs to move so that the segment at (4,3) moves away.\n> \n> Currently, after one move, (4,3) is occupied by the tail.\n> \n> Then, on the next move, when the snake moves again, the tail will move to where the second-to-last was, and the old tail position is vacated.\n> \n> Let's clarify with a small example.\n> \n> Suppose snake at positions: A (head), B, C (tail).\n> \n> After move to D, new positions: D (head), A, B. C is vacated.\n> \n> In this case, C was tail, now vacated.\n> \n> If there was a body segment, say positions: A, B, C, D (tail).\n> \n> After move to E, new positions: E, A, B, C. D vacated.\n> \n> So the cell that was tail is vacated after the move.\n> \n> In general, when the snake moves without eating, the cell that was the tail is vacated, and all other cells remain occupied but by different segments.\n> \n> For a cell that is not the tail, it remains occupied unless it was the tail.\n> \n> In this case, for (4,3), it is currently index 16, not the tail. Tail is index 17 at (5,3).\n> \n> After one move, index 16 becomes the new tail (since old index 17 is gone, new tail is old index 16).\n> \n> Then after another move, that new tail moves and its position is vacated.\n> \n> So for (4,3), to be vacated, it needs to become the tail and then the snake moves.\n> \n> Currently, at turn 97, (4,3) is index 16.\n> \n> After one move (turn 97 action), if no eat, new snake: new head at new position, then old head at (5,6) becomes new body, old index 1 at (6,6) becomes new index 2, ..., old index 16 at (4,3) becomes new index 17 (new tail), old index 17 at (5,3) vacated.\n> \n> So after turn 97 move, (4,3) is now occupied by the new tail.\n> \n> Then, on turn 98, when the snake moves again, if no eat, new head moves to another position, the new body segments shift, and the current tail (at (4,3)) moves to where the new second-to-last is, but since it's the tail, when it moves, the position (4,3) is vacated after the move.\n> \n> After turn 98 move, the cell that was tail at turn 98 is vacated.\n> \n> At turn 97 after move, tail is at (4,3).\n> \n> Then turn 98 move: head moves to new cell, say P, then new positions: P (head), then the previous head (which was at some position), and so on, up to the previous second-to-last, and the previous tail position is vacated.\n> \n> Since at start of turn 98, tail is at (4,3), after turn 98 move, (4,3) is vacated.\n> \n> So for food at (4,3), it can be eaten on turn 98 if head moves there, because on turn 98, after the move, (4,3) is free.\n> \n> Let's timeline:\n> \n> Turn 97: current state, (4,3) occupied.\n> \n> After turn 97 action (move): if no eat during move, then after move, (4,3) is now tail position.\n> \n> Then turn 98: before move, (4,3) is occupied by tail.\n> \n> When we move on turn 98, if head moves to (4,3), but (4,3) is occupied by tail, so if head moves to (4,3), it would collide with tail, but in Snake, moving to the tail cell is allowed because the tail moves away at the same time, so it doesn't collide if it's the tail.\n> \n> The core rules say: \"But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> Also, \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head adjacent to tail and tail cell has food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> But for moving to tail position, it should be safe.\n> \n> In this case, for (4,3), on turn 98, before move, it is occupied by tail.\n> \n> If on turn 98, I move head to (4,3), then since it's the tail, the head moves to (4,3), and the tail is removed, so no collision, and if there is food, I eat it and grow, so new tail is not there, but the segment that was tail is gone.\n> \n> Specifically: when head moves to a cell with food, the snake grows, so tail does not move, new segment added.\n> \n> But if head moves to tail position, which has food, it might be a problem.\n> \n> The \"Tail Reward Danger\" specifies: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has food, eating it kills.\n> \n> But if head moves directly to tail position, that might be different.\n> \n> Let's read carefully.\n> \n> \" **Tail Reward Danger**: If the head is *adjacent to the tail* and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n> \n> So this is for when head is adjacent, not on the same cell.\n> \n> If head moves to the tail cell directly, it might be okay, but the tail is there, so moving to it could be collision or not.\n> \n> The collision rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment).

But the danger is that after eating, the new tail is where the head was, and if it's adjacent, it might collide, but in this case, when head moves to tail cell, the old head position is vacated, so no issue.\n> \n> The rule says: \"because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n> \n> When you eat food at tail cell, new head at tail cell, new tail at old tail position, which is the same cell? No.\n> \n> Let's clarify:\n> \n> Suppose tail at T, head at H, adjacent.\n> \n> If I move head to T to eat food, then new head at T, new body segments: old head H, then old body, etc., and new tail added at old tail T, but T is now head, so it's messy.\n> \n> Positions: before move: head H, tail T, with food at T.\n> \n> After move: head moves to T, so new head at T. Then the body: the first body segment is at old head H. Then the next body segments follow. Since food eaten, a new segment is added at the position where the tail was, but the tail was at T, which is now head, so the new segment is added at T, but T is now head, so it would be head and new segment at same cell, which is impossible.\n> \n> I think there's a problem.\n> \n> Standard Snake mechanics: when the head moves to a cell with food, the head occupies that cell, and the tail does not move, so a new segment is added at the current tail position, extending the snake.\n> \n> So the cell that was food is now head, and the tail cell remains, with a new segment.\n> \n> But if the food is at the tail position, then head moves to tail position, which is the same cell, so it would be moving to a cell occupied by the tail, but in terms of collision, it might be allowed since the tail will not be there after, but it's confusing.\n> \n> Perhaps in this game, it's not possible to have food under tail, or the rule handles it.\n> \n> The special case says food can spawn under body, including tail, I think.\n> \n> But the Tail Reward Danger is for when head is adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it causes death because after eating, the new tail is added where the head was, and if head and tail were adjacent, after moving head to tail, the new head is at old tail, new first body at old head, so new head and new body are adjacent, which is fine, but the danger is that the new tail is added at old tail position, but old tail is now head, so the new segment is added at old tail position, which is now head, so it would be two segments at same cell.\n> \n> I think it's ambiguous, but the rule specifically says for adjacent case, it kills the snake.\n> \n> For moving directly to tail cell with food, it might be similar.\n> \n> To avoid risk, I should not eat food that is under tail or adjacent to tail if it's risky.\n> \n> For (4,3), at turn 98, it will be the tail, so I can move head to it on turn 98 to eat it safely.\n> \n> Similarly, for other food under body.\n> \n> First, for (4,3) with life_span 2 at turn 97.\n> \n> After turn 97, life_span decreases to 1.\n> \n> After turn 98, it decreases to 0 and disappears.\n> \n> So it can be eaten on turn 97 or 98.\n> \n> On turn 97, (4,3) is occupied by body, not free, so I cannot eat it on turn 97 because head cannot move to occupied cell except tail.\n> \n> Only if I move to the cell when it is free or when it is the tail.\n> \n> On turn 97, (4,3) is body, not tail, so I cannot move there; it would be body collision.\n> \n> On turn 98, it will be tail, so I can move there to eat it.\n> \n> So the only chance to eat (4,3) is on turn 98 by moving head to (4,3).\n> \n> If I don't, it disappears after turn 98.\n> \n> Now, head is at (5,6), and (4,3) is at (4,3), which is not adjacent; it's several cells away.\n> \n> Distance: from (5,6) to (4,3), delta x= -1, delta y= -3, so Manhattan distance 4, not reachable in one move.\n> \n> To reach (4,3) by turn 98, I need to move there on turn 98.\n> \n> Turn 98 action: move to (4,3).\n> \n> But from where?

Subsequent moves (right to (4,5) and (5,5)) avoid the congested left side with obstacles and walls, steering toward open space for long-term survival. The food at (4,3) was ignored as it was unreachable within its short life span, and risks near the tail or body collisions were minimized by not pursuing other under-body food immediately.\n",

Snake positions: head (4,6), then (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), etc. No (3,5), so (3,5) is free.\n> \n> But (4,3) is tail, (3,2) is body, (6,2) is body.\n> \n> For food under body, it can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves there.\n> \n> Specifically for (4,3), which is tail. Now, tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> Let's parse that.\n> \n> \"Tail Reward Danger: If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n> \n> In this case, head is at (4,6), tail at (4,3). Are they adjacent? (4,6) and (4,3) are not adjacent; they are three units apart vertically. Adjacent means sharing an edge, so up, down, left, right.\n> \n> Distance: |dy| = 3, so not adjacent. Head is at (4,6), possible adjacent cells: left (3,6), right (5,6) but snake body is there, down (4,5), up (4,7) but y=7 is wall, so not possible.\n> \n> y=7 is wall, so (4,7) invalid.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,6) is body, so not free.\n> \n> Tail at (4,3), adjacent cells: (4,2), (4,4), (3,3), (5,3). (4,2) is body, (3,3) is body, (4,4) is obstacle? Internal obstacles: (4,4) is listed, yes, wall. (5,3) might be free or not.\n> \n> Anyway, head and tail are not adjacent, so tail reward danger doesn't apply here directly.\n> \n> But for the food at (4,3), since it's under tail, to eat it, the tail must move away, and head move there.\n> \n> Currently, tail is at (4,3), and snake is moving. When snake moves, tail moves only if no food eaten; if food eaten, tail stays, and snake grows.\n> \n> Standard snake: when you eat food, you grow, so tail doesn't move that turn.\n> \n> Rule: \"Length of snake +1\" for positive food, so when eaten, snake grows, meaning tail stays in place, and new segment added.\n> \n> But for food under tail, if head moves to tail position when tail moves away? Let's see.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> For tail, when the snake moves without eating, the tail moves away, so the cell is vacated, then if head moves there later, it can eat.\n> \n> But if the food is under tail, and snake moves without eating, tail moves, food is exposed, then head can move to it later.\n> \n> If head moves directly to tail cell while food is there, but since tail is there, head can't move to occupied cell except for tail when moving, but in snake, head can move to the tail cell only if tail is about to move.\n> \n> Standard rule: in snake, head can move to the current tail position because when head moves there, tail moves away, so no collision if it's the only overlap.\n> \n> But here, with food, it might be different.\n> \n> I need to clarify.\n> \n> From the rule: for food under body, it must be that body moves away (so cell vacated), then head moves on.\n> \n> Specifically for tail: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it causes collision because after eating, tail doesn't move, so head and tail at same position? No.\n> \n> \"because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n> \n> Let's think: normally, when snake eats food, head moves to food cell, food is eaten, and since length increases, the tail does not move that turn. So if head moves to a cell that was occupied by tail, and tail was there, but when head moves there, tail is still there? No, positions are simultaneous.\n> \n> In grid terms: at turn t, snake occupies certain cells. When it moves, head moves to new position, and if no food eaten, tail moves away; if food eaten, tail stays, and new head position is added.\n> \n> So, if there is food at tail position, and head moves to tail position, then:\n> \n> - Head moves to (tail) cell.\n> \n> - Since food is eaten, tail does not move, so the tail cell now has both head and tail? But that can't be; positions must be unique.\n> \n> I think there's ambiguity.\n> \n> But the rule says: \"if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake\"\n> \n> Because after eating, the head is on the food cell (which was tail), and since tail doesn't move, the new tail is still there? No.\n> \n> After eating, the snake grows, so the tail remains where it was, and head is on the food cell, which was the tail cell, so they are on the same cell, collision.\n> \n> Yes, that makes sense.\n> \n> So if head moves to tail cell and eats food, since tail doesn't move, head and tail occupy same cell, collision, death.\n> \n> Therefore, it's only safe to eat food at tail if the tail is about to move away, meaning not eating food that turn, so tail moves, cell vacated, then later head can move there if food still there.\n> \n> But in this case, for (4,3), life span is 1, so only on turn 98 it can be eaten, else disappears.\n> \n> Turn 98: if snake moves and head goes to (4,3), but (4,3) is tail, so if it eats, collision, death.\n> \n> If it doesn't eat, tail moves away, but food disappears after turn, so no chance to eat later.\n> \n> So for (4,3), it's impossible to eat safely because if head goes there on turn 98, it eats and dies; if not, food gone.\n> \n> Therefore, the food at (4,3) cannot be eaten; it's a trap.\n> \n> Similarly, other foods under body might be eatable if body moves away first.\n> \n> But for now, let's list all food:\n> \n> - (4,3): on tail, life span 1, so must be eaten now or never, but eating now causes death, so avoid. Cannot eat.\n> \n> - (3,5): at (3,5), value 1, life span 3, so available for 3 turns (t98,99,100)\n> \n> - (6,2): at (6,2), which is a body segment. Snake has (6,2) in positions. Life span 6, so available for 6 turns.\n> \n> - (3,2): at (3,2), also body segment, life span 9.\n> \n> Now, for food under body, like (6,2) and (3,2), to eat them, the body must move away first, then head can move there.\n> \n> But since they are under body, and body will move as snake moves.\n> \n> First, snake head at (4,6), direction left.\n> \n> Possible moves from (4,6):\n> \n> - Left (L): to (3,6)\n> \n> - Right (R): to (5,6), but (5,6) is body segment, since snake positions: after head (4,6) is (5,6), so occupied, cannot move there.\n> \n> - Up (U): to (4,7), but y=7 is wall, so invalid.\n> \n> - Down (D): to (4,5)\n> \n> Also, cannot move opposite to current direction.

Snake positions: head (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), etc. No (3,6), so should be free, but need to check walls and obstacles.\n> \n> Walls: border x=0,7 y=0,7, so (3,6) is x=3,y=6, within 1 to 6? x from 0 to 7, walls at x=0 and x=7, so x=3 is fine, y=6 is fine, not border.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4) — none at (3,6), so free.\n> \n> (4,5): similarly, x=4,y=5, not border, not obstacle, and not in snake positions?

After move, snake: if head to (3,6), then new positions: head (3,6), then (4,6), (5,6), etc. So (4,6) is now body segment.\n> \n> So from (3,6), moves:\n> \n> - U: (3,7) wall, invalid\n> \n> - D: (3,5) — is it free?

New seg7 corresponds to old seg6, so the segment that was at (6,2) is now at the position of new seg7, which is the same as old seg6 position only if no move, but the position changes.\n> \n> The cell (6,2) is no longer occupied by the same segment; the segment moves to a new cell.\n> \n> Specifically, the segment that was at (6,2) (old seg6) is now at the position that old seg6 was pointing to or something.\n> \n> From the shift: new seg7 is old seg6, so if old seg6 was at (6,2), new seg7 is at (6,2) only if the snake didn't move, but since it moved, the position of new seg7 is the position that old seg6 was at, but old seg6 was at (6,2), so new seg7 is at (6,2)? I'm confusing myself.\n> \n> Let's clarify: the positions change.\n> \n> After the snake moves, the body segments are at different cells.\n> \n> For example, after moving head to (3,6), new positions:\n> \n> New seg0: (3,6)  head\n> \n> New seg1: old seg0: (4,6)\n> \n> New seg2: old seg1: (5,6)\n> \n> New seg3: old seg2: (6,6)\n> \n> New seg4: old seg3: (6,5)\n> \n> New seg5: old seg4: (6,4)\n> \n> New seg6: old seg5: (6,3)  // old seg5 was at (6,3), so new seg6 at (6,3)\n> \n> New seg7: old seg6: (6,2)  // old seg6 was at (6,2), so new seg7 at (6,2)\n> \n> Oh, so the cell (6,2) is still occupied by new seg7, which is the same segment as old seg6.\n> \n> So the food at (6,2) is still under the body, and it will be there until that segment moves away.\n> \n> The cell (6,2) will be vacated only when the segment that is there moves to a different position, which happens when the snake moves and that segment is not the tail or something.\n> \n> Specifically, when the segment at (6,2) moves to the next position in the chain.\n> \n> For example, if the snake keeps moving, eventually the tail will move away from its position, but for (6,2), it's in the middle.\n> \n> The cell (6,2) will be vacated when the segment that occupies it moves to another cell, and no other segment moves to it, which is when the snake moves forward without growing.\n> \n> But since the segment moves to the position of the previous segment in front, the cell it was in is vacated.\n> \n> For instance, in the next move, if head moves from (3,6) to (3,5), then new head (3,5), new seg1: old seg0: (3,6), new seg2: old seg1: (4,6), new seg3: old seg2: (5,6), new seg4: old seg3: (6,6), new seg5: old seg4: (6,5), new seg6: old seg5: (6,4), new seg7: old seg6: (6,3), new seg8: old seg7: (6,2)? Old seg7 was at (6,1) or something.\n> \n> After first move to (3,6), new seg7: old seg6: (6,2)\n> \n> Then when moving to (3,5), new head (3,5), new seg1: (3,6), new seg2: (4,6), new seg3: (5,6), new seg4: (6,6), new seg5: (6,5), new seg6: (6,4), new seg7: (6,3), new seg8: (6,2)?

Head at (4,1), tail at (1,1). If head moves right to (5,1), then new positions: (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1). Cell (1,1) vacated, cell (2,1) still occupied, cell (3,1) still, cell (4,1) still.\n> \n> If head moves up to (4,2), then new positions: (4,2), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1). Cell (1,1) vacated, cell (3,1) still occupied, etc.\n> \n> So for an internal cell, it is vacated only when the tail moves away from it, but since the tail is far, it takes time.\n> \n> In this case, for (6,2), it is currently occupied, and it will be occupied until the tail reaches that area, which might be many turns.\n> \n> Similarly for (3,2).\n> \n> To eat the food at (6,2), I need to have the head move to (6,2) after it is vacated, which requires the tail to have moved past, but that might take longer than the life span.\n> \n> Life span of (6,2) is 6, so only 6 turns including turn 98.\n> \n> Current tail is at (4,3), and (6,2) is not near the tail, so it will take many moves to vacate it.\n> \n> For example, the distance from tail to (6,2) is several cells, and each move, the tail moves one cell only if no growth, so it might take 10 or more moves to vacate (6,2), but life span only 6, so likely it will disappear before I can eat it.\n> \n> Similarly for (3,2), life span 9, tail at (4,3), closer.\n> \n> (3,2) is at position, and tail is at (4,3), then (3,3), etc.\n> \n> After some moves, tail might move away.\n> \n> But let's estimate.\n> \n> Current tail at (4,3).\n> \n> After one move no eat, tail moves to (3,3) or something.\n> \n> In initial state, tail at (4,3).\n> \n> After move to (3,6) or (4,5), tail moves to (3,3) or (4,3) removed, new tail at (3,3).\n> \n> Then after eating at (3,5) on turn 99, tail stays at (3,3) or moves?\n> \n> In the sequence, after eating at (3,5), tail at (3,3).\n> \n> Then when move to (2,5), no eat, tail moves to (3,4) or something.\n> \n> It's messy, and with life span short, it might not be feasible to eat the food under body.\n> \n> For (6,2) with life span 6, it's unlikely to be eatable within 6 turns, since the body is fixed relative for now.\n> \n> Similarly for (3,2), life span 9, might be possible if I can move the tail faster.\n> \n> But let's focus on the immediate choice.\n> \n> On turn 98, I have to choose between L to (3,6) or D to (4,5).\n> \n> Both allow me to eat (3,5) on turn 99.\n> \n> But in the L option, on turn 98, I go to (3,6), then on turn 99 I can choose to go to (3,5) or to (2,6).\n> \n> If I go to (2,6) on turn 99, I delay eating (3,5).\n> \n> But (3,5) has life span 3, so on turn 99, if not eaten, life span 2, still available on turn 100.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,6) is free, and from there I can go to (2,7) but y=7 wall, or (1,6) but x=1,y=6, obstacles at (1,2),(1,4),(1,5), but (1,6) not obstacle, so free, or (2,5), or (3,6) occupied.\n> \n> From (2,6), if I go there on turn 99, direction from (3,6) to (2,6) is left, so direction L.\n> \n> Then possible moves: U to (2,7) wall, D to (2,5), L to (1,6), R to (3,6) occupied.\n> \n> Cannot move R because opposite.\n> \n> So can move D to (2,5) or L to (1,6).\n> \n> (2,5) might be free or not.\n> \n> At that point, it might be free.\n> \n> But then I can eat (3,5) later.\n> \n> However, since I need to maximize score, eating (3,5) is good, and it's safe, so I should eat it soon.\n> \n> Similarly, in the D option on turn 98 to (4,5), then on turn 99 I can go to (3,5) or to (5,5).\n> \n> (5,5) is free, no snake, no wall.\n> \n> If I go to (5,5), then I can eat (3,5) later.\n> \n> But again, no need to delay.\n> \n> So probably best to eat (3,5) on turn 99 regardless.\n> \n> Now, for the sequence, I need to provide 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> But I don't know the future food, so I have to plan based on current state.\n> \n> Perhaps I should simulate a few turns.\n> \n> Also, after eating, as we saw, I will be forced to (2,5) then to (2,6), etc.\n> \n> Let's sketch a path.\n> \n> Suppose on turn 98, I move L to (3,6).\n> \n> Then turn 99: move D to (3,5) to eat food.\n> \n> Then turn 100: from (3,5), only move L to (2,5).\n> \n> Then turn 101: from (2,5), only move U to (2,6) as earlier.\n> \n> At turn 101, from (2,5), after moving from (3,5) to (2,5), direction L.\n> \n> Then from (2,5), moves: U to (2,6), D to (2,4) occupied, L to (1,5) obstacle, R to (3,5) occupied, so only U to (2,6).\n> \n> Move U to (2,6).\n> \n> Then at (2,6), direction U (since moved up).\n> \n> Then turn 102: from (2,6), possible moves: U to (2,7) wall, D to (2,5), L to (1,6), R to (3,6) occupied.\n> \n> Current direction U, so cannot move D (opposite).\n> \n> So can move L to (1,6) or R to (3,6) but occupied, so only L to (1,6).\n> \n> (1,6) is free, no obstacle.\n> \n> Move to (1,6).\n> \n> Then turn 103: from (1,6), direction L (moved left).\n> \n> Possible moves: U to (1,7) wall, D to (1,5) but (1,5) obstacle, L to (0,6) x=0 wall, R to (2,6) occupied.\n> \n> Also, cannot move R because opposite to L.\n> \n> So all moves invalid?

Borders x=0,7 y=0,7, so (1,6) should be free unless wall.\n> \n> Walls: border cells x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7, but internal obstacles specified, so (1,6) is not border, not internal obstacle, so free.\n> \n> Similarly, down to (2,5): free, as before.\n> \n> Up to (2,7) but y=7 wall.\n> \n> Right to (3,6) body, occupied.\n> \n> So from (2,6), can move down to (2,5) or left to (1,6).\n> \n> This is getting too far.\n> \n> Perhaps I should go down from (3,5) at turn 100 to access the food at (3,2) area.\n> \n> At turn 100, from (3,5), move down?

need the segment there to move.\n> \n> The segment at (3,2) will move when the snake moves, and it will go to where the previous segment was, which is (4,2) in the positions.\n> \n> After turn 99, position of (3,2) is between (4,2) and (2,2).\n> \n> In the sequence, if I move the head, the body follows.\n> \n> Perhaps after a few moves without eating, the tail advances, and the body moves, so

(2,5).\n> \n> Then turn 103, from (2,5), move down to (2,4).\n> \n> Then turn 104, from (2,4), move down to (2,3) or right to (3,4), etc.\n> \n> But this is arbitrary.\n> \n> Since the grid has

After turn 100 at (3,6), move L to (2,6) at turn 101.\n> \n> Then from (2,6), at turn 102, move D to (2,5)  // down\n> \n> Then from (2,5), at turn 103, move D to (2,4)\n> \n> Then from (2,4), at turn 104, move R to (3,4) or something.\n> \n> But (3,4) might be occupied or not, depending.\n> \n> To keep it simple, I'll provide a sequence for 5 turns: turns 99 to 103 or 104.\n> \n> The answer format

(2,6)\n> \n> Turn 102: D  // to (2,5)\n> \n> Turn 103: D  // to (2,4)\n> \n> From (2,4), I can move to (2,3) or (3,4), etc.\n> \n> But this is just one path.\n> \n> For the thinking conclusion, I can explain.\n> \n> Now, the other food: at (6,2), life span 5, so by turn 104, if not eaten, it disappears. In this sequence, I'm not going near it, so I might miss it, but it's under body, so I might not be able to eat it anyway in time.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,2) has longer life.\n> \n> Prioritize survival over immediate rewards, so missing one food is ok if I survive.\n> \n> In this sequence, I am moving to less crowded area, so survival is better.\n> \n> If I move right, I might get trapped.\n> \n> So I think L at 99 is better.\n> \n> Final decision.\n> </think>\n> ### Action Sequence (in order):\n> \n> \\boxed{\n> Turn 99: L\n> Turn 100: U\n> Turn 101: L\n> Turn 102: D\n> Turn 103: D\n> }\n> \n> ### Main Thinking Conclusion (one or two sentences):\n> I prioritized eating the positive food at (3,5) immediately on turn 99 to secure +1 score before it expires, then moved upward to open space for better maneuverability and long-term survival, avoiding the risky bottom-right area with obstacles and potential traps. This sequence ensures safety for 5+ turns by steering toward less crowded regions while setting up to access other food later.\n",
