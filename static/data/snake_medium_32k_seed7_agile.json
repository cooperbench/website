This path may lead to dead ends.\n\n2. **Option 2: Move Down (D) to (5, 5)**:\n   - **Pros**: Opens more options for future moves (e.g., `R` to (6, 5) or further `D`).\n   - **Cons**: Temporarily moves away from food at (4, 5), but this food has a long lifespan (10 turns).\n   - **Next Moves**: From (5, 5), can move `R` to (6, 5) or `D` to (5, 4), avoiding the trap of eating (4, 5) immediately.\n\n### Optimal Choice:\n- **Move Down (D) at Turn 25** to (5, 5).

This is the only viable move.\n\n3. **Food at (5,1)**:\n   - Value: +1 (positive food).\n   - Life span: 9 turns (will disappear at turn 56).\n   - Eating this food will increase the snake's length by 1 (from 13 to 14) and give a reward of +1.\n\n4. **Food at (4,2)**:\n   - Value: +1 (positive food).\n   - Life span: 6 turns (will disappear at turn 53).\n   - Currently occupied by the snake's body (segment at (4,2)), so it cannot be eaten now. To eat it, the snake must move away from (4,2) and then return to it after the body has vacated the cell. However, given the current constraints, this is not feasible before the food disappears.\n\n5. **Immediate Action**:\n   - The only safe move is **Right (R)** to (5,1) to eat the positive food there. All other moves lead to immediate death.\n\n### Action Sequence\n- **Turn 47**: Move right (R) to (5,1) to eat the positive food.\n- **Turn 48**: From (5,1), the only safe move is right (R) to (6,1) (other directions are blocked by walls or body).\n- **Turn 49**: From (6,1), the only safe move is up (U) to (6,2) (other directions are blocked by walls or body).\n- **Turn 50**: From (6,2), the only safe move is up (U) to (6,3) (other directions are blocked by walls or body).\n- **Turn 51**: From (6,3), the only safe move is up (U) to (6,4) (other directions are blocked by walls or body).\n- **Turn 52**: From (6,4), the only safe move is up (U) to (6,5) (other directions are blocked by walls or body).\n\n### Conclusion\nThe only viable immediate action is to move right to (5,1) to eat the positive food and avoid collision. Subsequent moves are forced to navigate the snake out of the corner and into open space for survival. The food at (4,2) cannot be safely reached before it expires.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\boxed{R}",

However:\n\n1. **No Instant Reverse**: Current direction is R, so cannot move L (opposite).\n2. **Collision Check**:\n   - **U (5,6)**: Occupied by body segment (5,6) → Collision\n   - **D (5,4)**: Not occupied by snake, not a wall or obstacle → Safe\n   - **R (6,5)**: Occupied by body segment (6,5) → Collision\n   - **L**: Invalid (opposite direction)\n\n**Conclusion**: Only possible move is **D (Down)** to (5,4).\n\n### Executing Move D at Turn 60\n\n- **New Head Position**: (5,4)\n- **Action**: Eat food at (5,4) → Snake length increases to 15\n- **New Direction**: D (Down)\n- **Updated Snake Positions**: Head at (5,4), followed by (5,5), (4,5), ..., tail at (4,1)\n- **Food Update**: (5,4) is eaten and removed; other foods' life spans decrease by 1:\n  - (2,4): Life Span 4\n  - (3,6): Life Span 7\n\n### Next Moves Based on Guidance\n\nThe provided guidance suggests a sequence of moves from Turn 60 to Turn 65. Let's verify the next moves:\n\n**Turn 61**:\n- **Head at (5,4), Direction D**\n- Possible moves:\n  - U (5,5): Body segment → Collision\n  - D (5,3): Free (not wall, obstacle, or body)\n  - L (4,4): Obstacle → Invalid\n  - R (6,4): Body segment → Collision\n- **Only possible move**: D to (5,3)\n\n**Turn 62**:\n- **Head at (5,3), Direction D**\n- Possible moves:\n  - U (5,4): Body segment → Collision\n  - D (5,2): Obstacle → Invalid\n  - L (4,3): Free\n  - R (6,3): Body segment → Collision\n- **Only possible move**: L to (4,3)\n\n**Turn 63**:\n- **Head at (4,3), Direction L**\n- Possible moves:\n  - U (4,4): Obstacle → Invalid\n  - D (4,2): Free\n  - L (3,3): Free\n  - R (5,3): Body segment → Collision\n- **Possible moves**: D or L\n- **Guidance chooses L to (3,3)** to move towards the left side and potentially free (3,6) later.\n\n**Turn 64**:\n- **Head at (3,3), Direction L**\n- Possible moves:\n  - U (3,4): Free\n  - D (3,2): Free\n  - L (2,3): Free\n  - R (4,3): Body segment → Collision\n- **Guidance chooses U to (3,4)** to position closer to (2,4) or (3,6)\n\n**Turn 65**:\n- **Head at (3,4), Direction U**\n- Possible moves:\n  - U (3,5): Body segment → Collision\n  - D (3,3): Body segment → Collision\n  - L (2,4): Free (food may be gone by then)\n  - R (4,4): Obstacle → Invalid\n- **Only possible move**: L to (2,4) (even if food is gone, it's safe)\n\n### Verifying the Sequence\n\nThe sequence ensures the snake avoids immediate collisions and positions itself to potentially access other food items later, especially (3,6), while acknowledging that (2,4) may not be reachable in time due to its short remaining lifespan.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the analysis and the guidance provided, the immediate action for Turn 60 is:\n\n\\boxed{D}",

Moving here would cause a collision. **Invalid**.\n\n### Conclusion for Turn 71:\n- Only valid move is **U (Up)** to (6,2).\n\n### Verification:\n- **No instant reverse**: Current direction is R, so L is opposite and disallowed (already invalid due to collision).\n- **Food Consideration**: \n  - (6,5) has life span 1 (disappears after this turn), but cannot be reached in one move from (6,1). Ignore.\n  - Other foods are not immediately accessible.\n\n### Final Decision:\n\\boxed{U}",

The food at (1,1) will disappear after this turn, and the others will remain for a few more turns.\n\n### Planning Future Moves\n\nAfter moving Up at Turn 92, the snake's head will be at (6,3), direction Up. Let's plan the next few moves to reach the accessible food at (3,5):\n\n1. **Turn 92**: U to (6,3)\n2. **Turn 93**: From (6,3), possible moves:\n   - U to (6,4) - Free\n   - D to (6,2) - Body collision (second segment)\n   - L to (5,3) - Body collision\n   - R to (7,3) - Wall\n   - Only possible move: U to (6,4)\n3. **Turn 94**: From (6,4), possible moves:\n   - U to (6,5) - Free\n   - D to (6,3) - Body collision\n   - L to (5,4) - Body collision\n   - R to (7,4) - Wall\n   - Only possible move: U to (6,5)\n4. **Turn 95**: From (6,5), possible moves:\n   - U to (6,6) - Free\n   - D to (6,4) - Body collision\n   - L to (5,5) - Contains food, but is the tail; eating it would cause collision (Tail Reward Danger)\n   - R to (7,5) - Wall\n   - Only safe move: U to (6,6)\n5. **Turn 96**: From (6,6), possible moves:\n   - U to (6,7) - Wall\n   - D to (6,5) - Body collision\n   - L to (5,6) - Free\n   - R to (7,6) - Wall\n   - Only possible move: L to (5,6)\n6. **Turn 97**: From (5,6), possible moves:\n   - U to (5,7) - Wall\n   - D to (5,5) - Free (food at (5,5) has disappeared by now)\n   - L to (4,6) - Free\n   - R to (6,6) - Body collision\n   - Choose L to (4,6) to head towards (3,5)\n7. **Turn 98**: From (4,6), possible moves:\n   - U to (4,7) - Wall\n   - D to (4,5) - Free\n   - L to (3,6) - Free\n   - R to (5,6) - Body collision\n   - Choose D to (4,5) to get closer to (3,5)\n8. **Turn 99**: From (4,5), possible moves:\n   - U to (4,6) - Body collision\n   - D to (4,4) - Obstacle at (4,4)\n   - L to (3,5) - Free, contains food\n   - R to (5,5) - Free but no food\n   - Choose L to (3,5) to eat the food\n\n### Final Action Sequence\n\nBased on the above reasoning, the immediate action at Turn 92 is to move Up. The subsequent moves are planned to navigate towards the food at (3,5) safely.\n\nHowever, since the task is to decide the immediate action for the current Turn (t0 = 92), the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{U}",
