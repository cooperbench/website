Valid moves:\n1. **L (Left) to (3,5)**:\n   - (3,5) has food (+1). Eating it grows the snake to length 6.\n   - New snake: [(3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4)].\n   - Direction becomes L.\n2. **D (Down) to (4,4)**:\n   - (4,4) is empty. No growth.\n   - New snake: [(4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4)].\n   - Direction becomes D.\n3. **U (Up) to (4,6)**:\n   - (4,6) is a wall (internal obstacle). Invalid move.\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Food at (6,2)**:\n   - Must be eaten now (life span 1), but the snake cannot reach it in one move (head is at (4,5), food at (6,2)). It will be lost regardless of the current move.\n2. **Food at (3,5)**:\n   - Can be eaten now (L move) or later (life span 6). If eaten now, the snake grows immediately.\n3. **Food at (6,3)**:\n   - Can be eaten later (life span 9). Planning to eat this after (3,5) is feasible.\n4. **Risks**:\n   - Moving L to (3,5) leads to a tighter space with obstacles, but it secures the +1 score immediately.\n   - Moving D to (4,4) avoids immediate growth but allows more flexibility to reach (6,3) later. However, (3,5) might be harder to reach later due to its shorter life span.\n\n### Decision:\n- **Prioritize eating (3,5) now** to ensure the +1 score, as it has a shorter life span (must be eaten by turn 22). The snake can then navigate toward (6,3) later, which has a longer life span (until turn 25).\n- Moving L to (3,5) is safe (no collisions) and maximizes the chance of eating both foods.\n\n### Action:\n\\boxed{L}",

This sets up the snake to reach the short-life-span food at (6,3) in subsequent turns while avoiding the risk of missing it. \n\nHere’s the immediate action:\n\n\\boxed{R}  \n\n### Reasoning:\n1. **Priority**: The food at (6,3) has a life span of 3 (disappears after Turn 26), while the food at (5,6) has a life span of 8. Missing (6,3) would forfeit a potential +1 score.\n2. **Path Safety**: Moving Right to (6,5) avoids collisions (no body/wall at (6,5)) and allows the snake to proceed downward to (6,4) and (6,3) in Turns 25–26 to eat the food.\n3. **Long-term Plan**: After eating (6,3), the snake can navigate toward (5,6) (life span 8 allows flexibility). The initial Right move is optimal for this sequence.\n\n### Additional Notes:\n- **No instant reverse**: Current direction is Up (U), so Down (D) is invalid. Left (L) is safe but delays reaching (6,3).\n- **Tail Reward Danger**: Not applicable here (tail at (3,5) is not adjacent to head at (5,5)).\n- **Food under body**: Neither food is under the snake’s body.  \n\nThus, **\\boxed{R}** is the correct immediate action for Turn 24.",

To eat it:\n   - The body must move away from (4,3), leaving it free.\n   - The head must then move onto (4,3).\n2. **Possible Moves from (3,4)** (current head):\n   - Cannot reverse direction (current direction is D, so U is invalid).\n   - **Down (D)**: (3,3) – free (not wall or body).\n   - **Left (L)**: (2,4) – free.\n   - **Right (R)**: (4,4) – occupied by body (invalid).\n3. **Tail Reward Danger**: Not applicable here (tail is at (5,5), not adjacent to head or food).\n\n### Immediate Options:\n1. **Move Down (D) to (3,3)**:\n   - New head: (3,3).\n   - Body shifts: (4,3) remains occupied by the next segment (no immediate freeing).\n   - Future flexibility: Can move left to (2,3) or down to (3,2) next.\n2. **Move Left (L) to (2,4)**:\n   - New head: (2,4).\n   - Body shifts: (4,3) remains occupied by the next segment.\n   - Future flexibility: Can move up to (2,5), left to (1,4), or down to (2,3).\n\n### Long-Term Plan to Eat Food:\n- To free (4,3), the segment currently on it must become the tail (which takes 5 moves without eating). However, the snake's movement will likely shift the body, making it hard to guarantee (4,3) becomes free.\n- Given the complexity, prioritize survival and open space. Moving left avoids dead ends near walls/obstacles (down leads to y=0 quickly).\n\n### Decision:\n- **Move Left (L) to (2,4)**. This keeps more options open for future moves and avoids immediate dead ends.\n\n\\boxed{L}",

This is a fatal trap.\n\n### Re-evaluating the Plan\nThe original plan to eat (3,6) is flawed because it traps the snake. Instead, we should:\n\n1. **Avoid (3,6)**: It's a dead end due to surrounding walls.\n2. **Target (5,1)**: Even though it's harder to reach, it's the only viable food. The earlier analysis showed that we cannot reach (5,1) in time, but let's confirm:\n   - (5,1) disappears after Turn 46 (life span 4: Turns 43-46).\n   - To eat it on Turn 46, we must move to (5,1) directly, which is impossible because:\n     - On Turn 46, the snake cannot be adjacent to (5,1) in a way that allows moving onto it (blocked by body/walls).\n\n3. **Alternative**: Since both foods lead to dead ends or are unreachable, the safest action is to **survive as long as possible** by avoiding collisions. \n\n### Optimal Immediate Action (Turn 43)\nFrom the current position (5,4) with direction R:\n- **Valid moves**: U (to (5,5)) or R (to (6,4)). \n  - D (to (5,3)) and L (to (4,4)) are invalid (collision and reverse, respectively).\n- **Choice**:\n  - Moving U to (5,5) is safer because:\n    - (6,4) is near the wall (x=6), which limits future mobility.\n    - (5,5) is more central and allows more flexibility in subsequent moves.\n\n### Final Decision\nGiven the constraints and the inevitability of (3,6) being a trap, the best immediate action is to move **up (U)** to (5,5) to maximize survival time, even though no food can be safely eaten.\n\n\\boxed{U}",

The action is consistent with the non-thinking executor role, strictly following the prior plan.",

Internal obstacles at (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6).\n- **Snake Positions**: Head at (2,5), followed by body segments: (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,2), (3,2) (tail).\n- **Head Direction**: Left (L), meaning the snake was moving left to reach (2,5) from (3,5).\n- **Food**:\n  - (2,1): value +1, life span 6 (disappears after Turn 68).\n  - (5,3): value +1, life span 8 (disappears after Turn 70).\n\n### Immediate Possible Moves at Turn 63\n\nFrom the head at (2,5), with current direction L, the possible moves are:\n\n1. **Up (U)**: (2,6)\n   - Check: (2,6) is an internal obstacle → **Blocked**.\n2. **Down (D)**: (2,4)\n   - Check: Not a wall, not an obstacle, not occupied by the snake → **Free**.\n3. **Left (L)**: (1,5)\n   - Check: (1,5) is an internal obstacle → **Blocked**.\n4. **Right (R)**: (3,5)\n   - Check: (3,5) is the first body segment → **Collision** (unless it's the tail, which it's not).\n\n**Conclusion**: The only possible move at Turn 63 is **Down (D)** to (2,4).\n\n### Verifying the Down Move\n\nAfter moving Down to (2,4):\n\n- **New Head Position**: (2,4)\n- **New Snake Positions**:\n  - Head: (2,4)\n  - Body: (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,2)\n  - Tail: (3,2) is removed (since no food is eaten), so the new tail is (4,2).\n- **New Head Direction**: Down (D).\n\n### Next Moves Planning\n\nGiven that the only immediate move is Down, let's plan the subsequent moves to maximize the score by eating both foods before they disappear.\n\n#### Path to (2,1):\n\n1. **Turn 63**: D → (2,4)\n2. **Turn 64**: From (2,4), possible moves:\n   - U: (2,5) → Body segment → Collision.\n   - D: (2,3) → Free.\n   - L: (1,4) → Free.\n   - R: (3,4) → Free.\n   \n   Best choice: **D** to (2,3) to get closer to (2,1).\n\n3. **Turn 65**: From (2,3), possible moves:\n   - U: (2,4) → Body segment → Collision.\n   - D: (2,2) → Free.\n   - L: (1,3) → Free.\n   - R: (3,3) → Free.\n   \n   Best choice: **D** to (2,2).\n\n4. **Turn 66**: From (2,2), possible moves:\n   - U: (2,3) → Body segment → Collision.\n   - D: (2,1) → Free (food).\n   - L: (1,2) → Obstacle → Blocked.\n   - R: (3,2) → Free.\n   \n   Best choice: **D** to (2,1) to eat the food.\n\n   - **Eating (2,1)**:\n     - Snake grows by 1: new tail remains at (5,3).\n     - New head: (2,1), body extends to include (2,2), etc.\n\n#### Path to (5,3) after Eating (2,1):\n\nAfter eating at (2,1) on Turn 66, the snake is at:\n\n- Head: (2,1)\n- Possible moves:\n  - U: (2,2) → Body segment → Collision.\n  - D: (2,0) → Wall → Blocked.\n  - L: (1,1) → Free.\n  - R: (3,1) → Free.\n  \n  Best choice: **R** to (3,1) to move towards (5,3).\n\nSubsequent moves:\n\n1. **Turn 67**: R → (3,1)\n2. **Turn 68**: From (3,1), possible moves:\n   - U: (3,2) → Free.\n   - D: (3,0) → Wall → Blocked.\n   - L: (2,1) → Body segment → Collision.\n   - R: (4,1) → Obstacle → Blocked.\n   \n   Only move: **U** to (3,2).\n\n3. **Turn 69**: From (3,2), possible moves:\n   - U: (3,3) → Free.\n   - D: (3,1) → Body segment → Collision.\n   - L: (2,2) → Free.\n   - R: (4,2) → Free.\n   \n   Best choice: **U** to (3,3) to align for (5,3).\n\n4. **Turn 70**: From (3,3), possible moves:\n   - U: (3,4) → Free.\n   - D: (3,2) → Body segment → Collision.\n   - L: (2,3) → Free.\n   - R: (4,3) → Free.\n   \n   Best choice: **R** to (4,3).\n\n5. **Turn 71**: From (4,3), possible moves:\n   - U: (4,4) → Free.\n   - D: (4,2) → Body segment → Collision.\n   - L: (3,3) → Body segment → Collision.\n   - R: (5,3) → Food (but life span ends at Turn 70, so it's gone).\n   \n   **Issue**: (5,3) disappears at Turn 71, so must eat it by Turn 70.\n\n   Correction: On Turn 70, from (4,3), move **R** to (5,3) to eat before it disappears.\n\n### Final Action Sequence\n\nBased on the above, the optimal sequence to eat both foods is:\n\n1. **Turn 63**: D (only possible move)\n2. **Turn 64**: D (towards (2,1))\n3. **Turn 65**: D\n4. **Turn 66**: D (eat (2,1))\n5. **Turn 67**: R (start moving towards (5,3))\n6. **Turn 68**: U\n7. **Turn 69**: U\n8. **Turn 70**: R (eat (5,3))\n\n### Verifying Food Life Spans\n\n- (2,1): Life span 6 (Turns 63-68) → Eaten on Turn 66 (valid).\n- (5,3): Life span 8 (Turns 63-70) → Eaten on Turn 70 (valid).\n\n### Checking for Collisions and Validity\n\n- All moves avoid walls, obstacles, and body collisions (except when moving into the tail, which is safe if the tail moves away).\n- The path to (5,3) ensures the body segment moves away from (5,3) by the time the head reaches it.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{D} (for Turn 63, as the immediate action)\n\n**Subsequent Planned Actions**:\n- Turn 64: D\n- Turn 65: D\n- Turn 66: D (eat (2,1))\n- Turn 67: R\n- Turn 68: U\n- Turn 69: U\n- Turn 70: R (eat (5,3))\n\n**Main Strategy**: Immediately move down to reach and eat the short-life food at (2,1), then navigate right and up to consume the second food at (5,3) before it expires, ensuring maximum score while avoiding all hazards.",

Internal walls at (4,6), (1,2), (1,5), (4,1), (2,6).\n\n### Possible Moves from (5,2):\n1. **Up (U)**: To (5,3). \n   - Invalid: Opposite of current direction (D) and collides with body segment (5,3).\n2. **Down (D)**: To (5,1). \n   - Valid: Not a wall or body segment.\n3. **Left (L)**: To (4,2). \n   - Valid: Not a wall or body segment.\n4. **Right (R)**: To (6,2). \n   - Valid: Not a wall or body segment.\n\n### Evaluating Moves:\n#### Option 1: D to (5,1)\n- Next moves would be constrained:\n  - From (5,1), only possible move is R to (6,1) (U to (5,2) is body, L to (4,1) is wall, D to (5,0) is wall).\n  - From (6,1), only possible move is U to (6,2).\n  - From (6,2), possible moves are U to (6,3) (tail) or D to (6,1) (body).\n  - This path avoids immediate death but doesn't progress toward the food and may lead to a dead end.\n\n#### Option 2: L to (4,2)\n- Progress toward food at (3,2):\n  - From (4,2), can move L to (3,2) to eat food on Turn 70.\n  - After eating, snake grows to length 16, and head is at (3,2).\n  - From (3,2), possible moves are D to (3,1) or L to (2,2) (U to (3,3) is body, R to (4,2) is body).\n  - Both (3,1) and (2,2) lead to tight spaces with high risk of trapping (e.g., (3,1) -> (2,1) -> (1,1) -> dead end).\n  - **Conclusion**: High risk of death after eating.\n\n#### Option 3: R to (6,2)\n- Moves away from food but explores safer space:\n  - From (6,2), can move U to (6,3) (tail) or D to (6,1).\n  - Moving U to (6,3) is safe (tail moves away).\n  - From (6,3), can move U to (6,4) (free) or L to (5,3) (body, invalid).\n  - This path keeps the snake alive longer and may free up space for future moves.\n\n### Decision:\n- **Avoid eating the food at (3,2)**: The path to the food is risky and likely leads to a quick dead end.\n- **Choose the safest immediate move**: Moving R to (6,2) avoids collisions and keeps the snake in a more open area, allowing for future flexibility.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{R}",

However, in the current turn (76), the only immediate safe move is Left to (4,5).\n\n### Final Decision\n\nGiven the analysis, the only safe and legal move at Turn 76 is:\n\n\\boxed{L}",

Thus, reaching the food is impossible within the time frame.\n\n### Survival Strategy:\nSince the food is unreachable and the snake risks getting trapped in loops or dead ends, the best immediate action is to **move towards the area with more free space** to prolong survival. Moving **R (Right) to (5, 3)** avoids immediate collisions and opens up more options for future moves (e.g., U to (5, 4) or D to (5, 2)).\n\n### Final Decision:\n\\boxed{R}",

According to rules, moving into the tail is safe because the tail will move away.\n   - **Down (D)**: (6,4) - Occupied by the body (second segment) and is the reverse direction (current direction is U), so invalid.\n   - **Left (L)**: (5,5) - Occupied by a body segment (not the tail), so invalid (collision).\n   - **Right (R)**: (7,5) - Wall (x=7 is a border), so invalid.\n\n3. **Conclusion for Turn 93**:\n   - The only valid move is **Up (U)** to (6,6), which is the tail. This is safe because the tail will move away after the head moves there.\n\n### Verification of Other Moves:\n- **Left (L) to (5,5)**: This is occupied by the body (not the tail), so it would result in a collision.

Thus, it can be eaten on Turn 101 if the head is adjacent to (2,2) and moves onto it.\n3. **Immediate Moves**:\n   - Move Down (D) to (5,4): Free cell, no food.\n   - Move Left (L) to (4,5): Currently the tail, safe to move (no food there).\n   - Move Right (R) to (6,5): Occupied by body (collision).\n\n### Plan to Eat (2,2) on Turn 101:\nTo eat (2,2) on Turn 101, we need to position the snake such that the head is adjacent to (2,2) on Turn 101 (e.g., at (2,1), (2,3), or (3,2)) and then move onto (2,2). \n\n### Immediate Action (Turn 96):\nBetween the two safe moves (D to (5,4) or L to (4,5)), moving Left to (4,5) is better because:\n- It brings the snake closer to the left side where (2,2) is located.\n- It avoids potential dead ends that might arise from moving Down.\n\n### Final Decision:\n\\boxed{L} (Move Left to (4,5))",
