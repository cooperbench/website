        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at (0,0) at turn t1 = 0, and I need to get to (0,9) in the minimal number of turns. The actions are U (up), D (down), or S (stay), changing the y-position by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9 inclusive.\n\nCollisions happen only if the player is on a freeway y=1 to 8 at some turn T, and for that freeway, there's a car where 0 is in its span at that exact turn T. The span moves over time based on direction and speed.\n\nImportant note: when you move to a new y-position, you're not on that row until the next turn. So if at turn T you're on y_T and you move to y_{T+1}, you're not considered on y_{T+1} at turn T; only at turn T+1 are you on that row.\n\nThe car states are given for each freeway k (which is y-position from 1 to 8). For each, there are cars with (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nDirection: right-moving means span goes to higher x over time, left-moving to lower x.\n\nFor collision: at turn T, for the row y_T, if there's a car with 0 in its span at T, collision.\n\nI need to avoid that.\n\nGoal: min H, sequence of actions from t=0 to t=H-1 such that y_H = 9? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence is {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1}, so actions from time t1 to t1+H-1, and after H actions, at time t1 + H, position should be (0,9)? But the position update: after action at t, y_{t+1} is set.\n\nStart at t=0, y0 = 0.\n\nAfter action a0, y1 = y0 + Δy0.\n\nAfter action a1, y2 = y1 + Δy1, and so on.\n\nAfter H actions, at time H, y_H is the position.\n\nBut we want y_{t1 + H} = 9, I think. t1=0, so y_H = 9.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t=0 to H-1, so after H actions, time is H, y_H =9.\n\nAnd H is the number of turns, I think, from start to end.\n\nMin H such that y_H =9.\n\nNow, since we start at y=0, and need to go to y=9, we must move up at least 9 times. Each U move increases y by 1, D decreases, S stays. So to go from 0 to 9, we need at least 9 U actions. H must be at least 9, since we start at time 0, after 9 U actions, at time 9, y=9, if no S or D.\n\nBut we might have S or D to avoid cars, so H could be larger.\n\nBut min H is at least 9.\n\nNow, we need to avoid collisions when on rows 1-8.\n\nAt time T, if y_T is between 1 and 8, we need that for freeway y_T, no car has 0 in span at turn T.\n\nNow, the cars are moving, so I need to compute for each row, when cars are present at x=0.\n\nGiven car states at t1=0.\n\nFor each car, I can find the times when it covers x=0.\n\nBut since the player is moving, the row changes, so I need to consider for each possible path.\n\nSince we want min H, probably we should go up as fast as possible, but avoid collisions.\n\nFirst, let's list all cars and their positions over time.\n\nGeneral car update:\n\nFor a car with initial span [h, τ] at t=0, direction d, speed s.\n\nIf left-moving, d=left, then at time T, span is [h - s*T, τ - s*T]\n\nIf right-moving, d=right, span [τ + s*T, h + s*T]\n\nIn the table, for left-moving, head h, tail τ, but for left-moving, head is at left? I think head and tail define the ends.\n\nIn the update:\n\nLeft-moving: span(t1) = [h, τ] → span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nSince moving left, x decreasing.\n\nSimilarly, right-moving: span(t1) = [τ, h] → span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nIn the car state, for left-moving, it's given as (h, τ, left, s), and span at t1 is [h, τ] with h and τ such that for left, h is the right end? Let's see an example.\n\nFor freeway 6: (48, 83, left, 36)\n\nAt t=0, span = [48, 83]? But 48 to 83, that's increasing x, but direction left, which is decreasing x. Inconsistency?\n\nPerhaps the head and tail are defined based on direction.\n\nIn the update rule:\n\nFor left-moving, span(t1) = [h, τ] and it moves left, so h and τ decrease.\n\nSimilarly for right, span(t1) = [τ, h] and moves right, so τ and h increase.\n\nIn the car state, for left-moving, (h, τ, left, s), at t1, span [h, τ], and for left, h is the leftmost or rightmost?\n\nIn the update, for left: [h, τ] at t1, then at T, [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT], so if s>0, moving left, x decreasing, so the smaller x is h - sΔT, larger is τ - sΔT? Not necessarily.\n\nFor example, freeway 6: (48, 83, left, 36)\n\nAt t=0, span [48,83]. Since direction left, moving left, so at T, span [48 - 36T, 83 - 36T]\n\n48 - 36T and 83 - 36T, since 48<83, at T=0, min x=48, max x=83.\n\nAs T increases, both decrease, min x decreases faster if s same, but s same, so min x = 48 -36T, max x =83 -36T.\n\n0 is covered when min x <=0 <= max x, so 48-36T <=0 <=83-36T.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving.\n\nIn the state, for right-moving, it's given as (head, tail, right, s), and span(t1) = [τ, h]? From the update rule.\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\nIn the car update rules:\n\nFor car on freeway i, at t1, head h, tail τ.\n\nThen:\n\nLeft-moving: span(t1) = [h, τ] → span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nRight-moving: span(t1) = [τ, h] → span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nSo for right-moving, at t1, span is [τ, h], with τ and h such that for right-moving, τ is the left end, h is the right end, I think.\n\nIn the table, for example, freeway 1: (-48, -59, right, 4)\n\nRight-moving, so span at t1=0 is [τ, h] = [-59, -48]? τ = -59, h = -48, so span [ -59, -48 ] since for right, [τ,h].\n\nThen at T, span [ -59 + 4T, -48 + 4T ]\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, like freeway 6: (48,83,left,36), span at t1 [48,83], at T [48-36T, 83-36T]\n\nNow, collision at turn T if player is on freeway k at T, and for that k, there is a car with 0 in its span at T.\n\nAlso, multiple cars per freeway possible.\n\nNow, let's list for each freeway the cars and when they cover x=0.\n\nSince we care about when x=0 is covered.\n\nFor each car, find the time interval when 0 is in its span.\n\nThen for a given freeway, the times when it is dangerous to be on that row.\n\nBut since player moves, we need to ensure that when on row k at time T, it is safe, i.e., no car on k has 0 in span at T.\n\nFirst, let's compute for each freeway the dangerous times.\n\nStart with freeway 1: k=1\n\nCar: (-48, -59, right, 4)\n\nSince right-moving, span at T: [τ + sT, h + sT] = [-59 + 4T, -48 + 4T]\n\n0 in span if -59 +4T <= 0 <= -48 +4T\n\nSo -59 +4T <= 0 and 0 <= -48 +4T\n\nFirst inequality: -59 +4T <=0 => 4T <=59 => T <= 59/4 = 14.75\n\nSecond: 0 <= -48 +4T => 4T >=48 => T >=12\n\nSo for T from 12 to 14.75, inclusive? Since at integer T, I think turns are discrete, so T integer.\n\nT is turn number, so integer.\n\nSo T from 12 to 14 inclusive? Let's see:\n\nAt T=12: lower bound -59 +4*12 = -59+48= -11 <=0, upper bound -48+48=0, so 0 <=0, so 0 is included.\n\nAt T=13: lower -59+52= -7 <=0, upper -48+52=4 >=0, so 0 in span.\n\nAt T=14: lower -59+56= -3 <=0, upper -48+56=8 >=0, 0 in span.\n\nAt T=15: lower -59+60=1 >0, upper -48+60=12>0, 0 not <=1? 0 <1, so not in [1,12], so not covered.\n\nSimilarly T=11: lower -59+44= -15 <=0, upper -48+44= -4 <0? -4 <0, so 0 not <= -4? Span is [lower, upper], so if upper <0, 0 not in.\n\nAt T=11: lower -15 <=0, upper -4 <0, so 0 not in [-15,-4] since -4<0.\n\nOnly if lower <=0 and upper >=0.\n\nSo for this car, 0 in span when T=12,13,14.\n\nT=12,13,14.\n\nNow, only one car on freeway 1.\n\nSo freeway 1 is dangerous at T=12,13,14.\n\nNow freeway 2: k=2\n\nCar: (-48, -59, right, 4) same as above.\n\nSo same, dangerous at T=12,13,14.\n\nNow freeway 3: k=3\n\nCars: (48, 37, right, 4) and (0, -11, right, 4)\n\nFirst car: (48, 37, right, 4)\n\nRight-moving, so span at T: [τ + sT, h + sT], but τ and h: given (head, tail) = (48,37), but for right-moving, span(t1) = [τ, h] = [37,48]? From the rule.\n\nIn the car state, it's listed as (head, tail, dir, speed)\n\nFor right-moving, head is the front, I think, so for right, head is larger x, tail is smaller.\n\nIn the update, for right-moving: span(t1) = [τ, h] where τ is tail, h is head, so τ < h for right-moving.\n\nHere (48,37, right,4), so head=48, tail=37, so for right, span at t1 = [τ, h] = [37,48]\n\nThen at T, [37 + 4T, 48 + 4T]\n\n0 in span? 37+4T <=0 <=48+4T?\n\nBut 37+4T >=37>0 for T>=0, so lower bound >0, so 0 never in span. Since min x=37+4T >0.\n\nSimilarly, max x=48+4T>0, so 0 not in [37+4T, 48+4T] for any T.\n\nNow second car on k=3: (0, -11, right, 4)\n\nHead=0, tail=-11, right-moving, span at t1 = [τ, h] = [-11, 0]\n\nThen at T, [ -11 + 4T, 0 + 4T ] = [-11+4T, 4T]\n\n0 in span if -11+4T <=0 <=4T\n\nFirst: -11+4T <=0 => 4T <=11 => T<=11/4=2.75\n\nSecond: 0 <=4T => T>=0\n\nSo for T from 0 to 2.75, so T=0,1,2 since integer.\n\nAt T=0: span [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nT=1: [-11+4,4] = [-7,4], 0 in.\n\nT=2: [-11+8,8] = [-3,8], 0 in.\n\nT=3: [-11+12,12]= [1,12], 1>0, 0 not in.\n\nSo car 2 covers x=0 at T=0,1,2.\n\nNow, for freeway 3, at time T, if either car has 0 in span, collision.\n\nFirst car never has 0, second car has at T=0,1,2.\n\nSo freeway 3 dangerous at T=0,1,2.\n\nNow freeway 4: k=4\n\nCars: (48, 37, right, 4) and (0, -11, right, 4) same as k=3.\n\nSo identical to k=3, dangerous at T=0,1,2.\n\nFreeway 5: same as k=3 and k=4, (48,37,right,4) and (0,-11,right,4), so dangerous T=0,1,2.\n\nNow freeway 6: k=6\n\nCar: (48, 83, left, 36)\n\nLeft-moving, span at t1 [h,τ] = [48,83], at T [48-36T, 83-36T]\n\n0 in span if 48-36T <=0 <=83-36T\n\nFirst: 48-36T <=0 => 48<=36T => T>=48/36=4/3≈1.333, so T>=2 since integer? T=2,3,...\n\n48-36T <=0 => 36T >=48 => T>=48/36=4/3=1.333, so T>=2\n\nSecond: 0 <=83-36T => 36T <=83 => T<=83/36≈2.305, so T<=2\n\nThus only possible at T=2.\n\nAt T=2: lower 48-72= -24 <=0, upper 83-72=11 >=0, yes 0 in [-24,11]\n\nAt T=1: lower 48-36=12>0? 12>0, upper 83-36=47>0, so [12,47], 0 not in.\n\nT=3: lower 48-108= -60 <=0, upper 83-108= -25 <0, so [-60,-25], 0 not in since -25<0.\n\nSo only at T=2, freeway 6 has a car covering x=0.\n\nDangerous only at T=2.\n\nNow freeway 7: k=7\n\nCars: (48, 37, right, 4), (12, 1, right, 4), (-24, -35, right, 4)\n\nFirst car: (48,37,right,4) same as before, span at T [37+4T,48+4T], min>0, never covers 0.\n\nSecond car: (12,1,right,4)\n\nHead=12, tail=1, right-moving, span at t1 [τ,h] = [1,12]\n\nAt T, [1+4T, 12+4T]\n\n0 in span? 1+4T <=0 <=12+4T? But 1+4T >=1>0, so never <=0, so 0 not in.\n\nThird car: (-24, -35, right, 4)\n\nHead=-24, tail=-35, right-moving, span at t1 [τ,h] = [-35,-24]\n\nAt T, [-35+4T, -24+4T]\n\n0 in span if -35+4T <=0 <= -24+4T\n\nFirst: -35+4T <=0 => 4T <=35 => T<=35/4=8.75\n\nSecond: 0 <= -24+4T => 4T >=24 => T>=6\n\nSo T from 6 to 8 inclusive.\n\nAt T=6: lower -35+24= -11 <=0, upper -24+24=0, 0 included.\n\nT=7: lower -35+28= -7 <=0, upper -24+28=4 >=0\n\nT=8: lower -35+32= -3 <=0, upper -24+32=8 >=0\n\nT=9: lower -35+36=1 >0, upper -24+36=12>0, not.\n\nSo third car covers 0 at T=6,7,8.\n\nNow for freeway 7, first car never, second car never, only third car at T=6,7,8.\n\nSo dangerous at T=6,7,8.\n\nNow freeway 8: k=8\n\nCar: (-48, -59, right, 4) same as freeway 1 and 2.\n\nSo dangerous at T=12,13,14.\n\nNow, summarize dangerous times for each row:\n\nFreeway 1: dangerous at T=12,13,14\n\nFreeway 2: T=12,13,14\n\nFreeway 3: T=0,1,2\n\nFreeway 4: T=0,1,2\n\nFreeway 5: T=0,1,2\n\nFreeway 6: T=2 only\n\nFreeway 7: T=6,7,8\n\nFreeway 8: T=12,13,14\n\nNow, player starts at t=0, y=0.\n\nAt t=0, y=0, which is not a freeway, so no collision possible at y=0.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at some time H.\n\ny=9 is the goal, not a freeway, so no car there.\n\nNow, to go from y=0 to y=9, we need to pass through rows 1 to 8.\n\nAt each time T, we are on some row y_T.\n\nWe need to choose actions so that when on row k at time T, it is not a dangerous time for k.\n\nAlso, since we can move up, down, or stay, we can delay or advance to avoid dangerous times.\n\nBut min H, so we want to go up as fast as possible, but avoid being on dangerous rows at dangerous times.\n\nStart at t=0, y=0.\n\nWe can take action at t=0 to go to y=1 or stay at y=0.\n\nBut y=0 is safe, no cars.\n\nNow, rows 3,4,5 are dangerous at T=0,1,2. But row 3 is freeway 3, which is y=3.\n\nFreeway k corresponds to row y=k.\n\nSo at T=0,1,2, if on row 3,4, or 5, collision.\n\nSimilarly, row 6 dangerous only at T=2.\n\nRow 7 dangerous at T=6,7,8.\n\nRow 1 and 2 dangerous at T=12,13,14.\n\nBut T=12 is far, we might reach before that.\n\nSince we start at t=0, and need to go to y=9, min time is 9 turns if we go up every time.\n\nBut let's see if possible with H=9.\n\nIf we go up every turn:\n\nt=0: y=0, action U, to y1=1\n\nt=1: on y=1, action U, to y2=2\n\nt=2: on y=2, action U, to y3=3\n\n...\n\nAt t=0: after action, at t=1, y=1\n\nNow, at time T, position y_T.\n\nAt T=1, y=1, freeway 1.\n\nIs it dangerous? Freeway 1 dangerous only at T=12,13,14, not at T=1. So safe.\n\nT=2, y=2, freeway 2, dangerous at T=12,13,14, not now, safe.\n\nT=3, y=3, freeway 3, dangerous at T=0,1,2, but T=3>2, so not dangerous? Freeway 3 dangerous only at T=0,1,2, so at T=3, it should be safe.\n\nSimilarly, T=4, y=4, freeway 4, dangerous T=0,1,2, T=4>2 safe.\n\nT=5, y=5, freeway 5, dangerous T=0,1,2, T=5 safe.\n\nT=6, y=6, freeway 6, dangerous only at T=2, T=6≠2, safe.\n\nT=7, y=7, freeway 7, dangerous at T=6,7,8. T=7 is dangerous! Oh.\n\nAt T=7, if on y=7, collision because freeway 7 dangerous at T=6,7,8.\n\nSimilarly, T=8, y=8, freeway 8, dangerous at T=12,13,14, not now, safe? T=8, freeway 8 dangerous only at T=12,13,14, so safe at T=8.\n\nBut at T=7, y=7, dangerous.\n\nIn the sequence: if we go up every step:\n\nStart t=0, y0=0, action U, y1=1\n\nt=1, y1=1, action U, y2=2\n\nt=2, y2=2, action U, y3=3\n\nt=3, y3=3, action U, y4=4\n\nt=4, y4=4, action U, y5=5\n\nt=5, y5=5, action U, y6=6\n\nt=6, y6=6, action U, y7=7\n\nt=7, y7=7, action U, y8=8\n\nt=8, y8=8, action U, y9=9\n\nNow, at which times are we on which row:\n\nAt time T=1: y=1, row 1, safe (danger times 12-14)\n\nT=2: y=2, row 2, safe\n\nT=3: y=3, row 3, dangerous times 0,1,2; T=3>2, safe\n\nT=4: y=4, row 4, dangerous 0,1,2, T=4>2 safe\n\nT=5: y=5, row 5, dangerous 0,1,2, T=5>2 safe\n\nT=6: y=6, row 6, dangerous only T=2, T=6≠2 safe\n\nT=7: y=7, row 7, dangerous at T=6,7,8; T=7 is dangerous! Collision.\n\nSo at T=7, on row 7, which is dangerous, so collision.\n\nThus, cannot go directly with all U in 9 turns.\n\nNeed to avoid being on row 7 at T=6,7,8.\n\nSimilarly, row 6 is only dangerous at T=2, which we avoided since at T=2 we were on row 2.\n\nIn the sequence above, at T=2, we were on row 2, not row 6.\n\nNow, to avoid collision on row 7 at T=7, we need not to be on row 7 at T=7.\n\nSince we want min H, perhaps we can delay or something.\n\nAt t=6, when we are on row 6, instead of going up to row 7 at t=7, we could stay or go down, but going down might not help.\n\nWe need to reach row 9.\n\nPossible actions at t=6: if on y6=6, we can:\n\n- Action U: go to y7=7 at t=7\n\nBut at t=7, on row 7, dangerous.\n\n- Action S: stay at y7=6 at t=7? After action, y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\n\nAt time t=6, position y6=6, we take action a6, which sets y7.\n\nIf a6 = S, then y7=6, so at time T=7, we are on row 6.\n\nRow 6 is only dangerous at T=2, so at T=7, safe.\n\nThen at t=7, we can take action, say U, to go to y8=7 at t=8.\n\nBut at t=8, on row 7, which is dangerous at T=8? Row 7 dangerous at T=6,7,8.\n\nT=8 is dangerous.\n\nIf at t=7, on y7=6, action U, to y8=7 at t=8.\n\nThen at T=8, on row 7, dangerous.\n\nIf we stay again at t=7: a7=S, y8=6, then at T=8 on row 6, safe, but we are stuck.\n\nThen we need to go up later.\n\nBut min H, so we want to proceed.\n\nSince row 7 is dangerous from T=6 to 8, we need to avoid row 7 during those times.\n\nWe can be on row 7 before or after.\n\nFor example, we can go to row 7 at T=5 or earlier, or T=9 or later.\n\nBut row 7 dangerous only at 6,7,8, so at T=5, is it safe? Freeway 7 dangerous times 6,7,8, so at T=5, if on row 7, should be safe.\n\nSimilarly, at T=9, safe.\n\nNow, in our min path, we were at row 6 at T=6, which is safe.\n\nWe need to go to row 7 at some time when safe.\n\nIf we go to row 7 at T=5, but at T=5, in the sequence, we were at row 5.\n\nLet's list the times we can be on each row safely.\n\nFor row 7: safe except T=6,7,8. So safe at T<=5 or T>=9.\n\nSimilarly, other rows.\n\nRow 1: safe except T=12,13,14, so for early times, safe.\n\nSimilarly row 2 same.\n\nRow 3,4,5: dangerous at T=0,1,2, so safe for T>=3.\n\nRow 6: dangerous only at T=2, so safe for all T except T=2.\n\nRow 8: dangerous at T=12,13,14, so for early times, safe.\n\nNow, we start at t=0, y=0.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at some H.\n\nSince we need to go up 9 times, H at least 9.\n\nWith H=9, we can be at y=9 at T=9.\n\nNow, positions over time.\n\nWe need to be on row 1 at some T not 12,13,14 — but since T=9<12, safe.\n\nSimilarly all rows except row 7 at critical times.\n\nSpecifically, for row 7, we need to be on it at T<=5 or T>=9.\n\nBut with H=9, at T=9, we are at y=9, not on row 7.\n\nWe are on row 7 at some T before.\n\nIn the direct path, we were on row 7 at T=7, which is bad.\n\nTo avoid, we can be on row 7 earlier, say at T=5.\n\nBut at T=5, in the sequence, we were at row 5.\n\nWe need to adjust the path.\n\nFor example, we can go faster to upper rows or slower.\n\nSince min H, we don't want to add extra turns, so we should go up as much as possible but adjust timing.\n\nWe can reach row 6 by T=6, which is safe.\n\nThen instead of going up to 7 at T=7, we can stay at row 6 for one turn.\n\nAt T=6, on row 6, safe.\n\nTake action S at t=6: so y7=6 (at time T=7)\n\nThen at T=7, on row 6, safe (since row 6 only dangerous at T=2)\n\nThen at t=7, take action U: y8=7 (at time T=8)\n\nBut at T=8, on row 7, which is dangerous at T=8.\n\nCollision.\n\nTake action D at t=7? But that goes down to row 5, not helpful.\n\nWe need to go to row 7 at a safe time.\n\nSafe times for row 7: T<=5 or T>=9.\n\nT=9 is when we might be at y=9.\n\nBut at T=9, if we are at y=9, not on row 7.\n\nWe need to be on row 7 at some T.\n\nThe earliest we can be on row 7 is T=7 if we go straight up, but that is dangerous.\n\nWe can be on row 7 at T=5, for example.\n\nHow to be on row 7 at T=5?\n\nThat means by time 5, we have moved up 7 times? Start at y0=0.\n\nAfter t actions, at time t, y_t.\n\nTo have y_t = k, we need at least k up moves by time t.\n\nAt time T, position y_T.\n\nTo have y_5 =7, we need to have moved up 7 times in 5 actions, but from t=0 to t=5, 5 actions, y5 = sum of Δy from t=0 to 4? Let's clarify.\n\nTime and actions:\n\nAt time t=0: position y0=0, before any action.\n\nAction a0 at t=0: sets y1 = y0 + Δy0\n\nAction a1 at t=1: sets y2 = y1 + Δy1\n\n...\n\nAction a_{t} at time t: sets y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\n\nPosition at time T is y_T.\n\ny_T is set after action at T-1.\n\nTo have y_T = k, after T actions from start? From t=0 to t=T-1, T actions set y_T.\n\nFor example, y1 is set after a0.\n\ny2 after a1, etc.\n\ny_T after action a_{T-1}.\n\nNumber of actions to reach time T is T actions (from t=0 to t=T-1).\n\nTo be at position k at time T, we need net up moves.\n\nStart from y0=0, so to be at y_T = k, we need exactly k more U than D, and the number of actions is T, so let U be number of U, D number of D, S number of S, U + D + S = T, and y_T = U - D.\n\nSince start from 0.\n\nAnd y_T = k.\n\nAlso U - D = k, U + D + S = T.\n\nSince S = T - U - D.\n\nNow for min H, we want to reach y_H =9 with min H.\n\nBut H is the number of turns, actions from t=0 to H-1, to reach y_H=9.\n\nAfter H actions, at time H.\n\nNow back to being at row 7 at T=5.\n\ny_5 =7.\n\nThen U - D =7, U + D + S =5.\n\nSince y_5 = U - D =7, and U + D + S =5, with S >=0.\n\nU - D =7, U + D <=5 (since S>=0)\n\nBut U + D >= |U - D| =7, so U + D >=7, but U + D <=5, contradiction.\n\nImpossible to have y_5=7 with only 5 actions? Actions from t=0 to t=4, 5 actions set y5.\n\nWith 5 actions, max y5 is 5 (all U), min is -5.\n\nSo y5 <=5, cannot be 7.\n\nSimilarly, earliest to be at y=7 is at time T=7, with all U: y7=7.\n\nSimilarly, at T=6, y6 <=6, etc.\n\nSo we cannot be on row 7 before T=7 with min actions.\n\nSimilarly, after, we can be at T=9 or later.\n\nBut at T=9, with y9=9, not on row 7.\n\nWe need to be on row 7 at some point to go to row 8.\n\nThe only possible times to be on row 7 are T=7,8,9,... but for T=7 and T=8, it is dangerous, T=9 is safe but at T=9 we are at y=9 if we go up.\n\nBut we can be on row 7 at T=9, for example, if we delay.\n\nFor instance, at some point we stay or go down to be on row 7 later.\n\nBut that increases H.\n\nSince row 7 is dangerous at T=6,7,8, and we can be on it at T=9 or later.\n\nT=9 is safe.\n\nNow, to be on row 7 at T=9, we need y9=7.\n\nThen from there go up to y=9 later.\n\nBut that would take more turns.\n\nFor example, if y9=7, then we need two more U to go to y=9, so H=11 or something.\n\nBut min H might be less if we can avoid the danger zone.\n\nAnother idea: since row 6 is safe at all times except T=2, and we can be there early.\n\nFor example, we can go to row 6 at T=6, as before.\n\nThen instead of going up, we stay at row 6 for two turns, to skip T=7 and T=8 for row 7.\n\nThen go up at T=9 or something.\n\nLet's see.\n\nStart: go up as fast to row 6.\n\nt=0: a0=U, y1=1 at T=1\n\nT=1: on row 1, safe\n\na1=U, y2=2 at T=2\n\nT=2: on row 2, safe (danger at 12-14)\n\na2=U, y3=3 at T=3\n\nT=3: on row 3, dangerous at 0,1,2, T=3>2 safe\n\na3=U, y4=4 at T=4\n\nT=4: on row 4, safe\n\na4=U, y5=5 at T=5\n\nT=5: on row 5, safe\n\na5=U, y6=6 at T=6\n\nT=6: on row 6, safe\n\nNow at t=6, we are on y6=6, and T=6.\n\nWe need to avoid row 7 at T=7 and T=8.\n\nSo at t=6, if we take action S: a6=S, then y7=6, so at T=7, on row 6, safe.\n\nThen at t=7, we can take action S again: a7=S, y8=6, at T=8, on row 6, safe.\n\nThen at t=8, take action U: a8=U, y9=7 at T=9\n\nAt T=9, on row 7. Now row 7 dangerous at 6,7,8, T=9>8, so safe.\n\nThen at t=9, action U: a9=U, y10=8 at T=10\n\nAt T=10, on row 8. Row 8 dangerous at 12,13,14, T=10<12, safe.\n\nThen at t=10, action U: a10=U, y11=9 at T=11\n\nSo we reach y=9 at T=11, with H=11 actions? Actions from t=0 to t=10, 11 actions, y11=9.\n\nBut we started at t=0, actions a0 to a10, 11 actions, time from 0 to 10, position at time 11 is y11=9.\n\nH is the number of turns, I think.\n\nIn the sequence, {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1}, so t from 0 to H-1, H actions.\n\nAfter H actions, position at time t1 + H.\n\nt1=0, so at time H, position (0,H) should be (0,9)? y_H=9.\n\nIn this case, with 11 actions, at time 11, y=9.\n\nBut min H is at least 9, and with 9 we had problem at row 7.\n\nCan we do with H=10?\n\nWith H=10, at time 10, y=9.\n\ny10=9.\n\nNow, we need to be on row 7 at some T, not 6,7,8.\n\nWith H=10, we can be on row 7 at T=9, for example.\n\nHow?\n\ny10=9.\n\nWe need y_T=7 for some T.\n\nIf we go directly, we might be on row 7 at T=7 or 8, which are bad.\n\nBut we can be on row 7 at T=9.\n\ny9=7, then y10=8 or something.\n\ny10=9, so at time 10, y=9.\n\nTo have y9=7, then from y9=7 to y10=9, we need to go up twice, but in one step? No, each action changes y by at most 1.\n\nFrom y9 to y10, only one action, so y10 = y9 + Δy, so if y9=7, y10=8 or 6 or 7, not 9 directly.\n\ny10=9 only if y9=8 or 9, and action U or S.\n\nIf y9=8, action U, y10=9.\n\nIf y9=9, action S, y10=9.\n\nBut we need to be on row 7 at some point.\n\nFor y10=9, we must have passed through row 7 at some time.\n\nThe time when we are on row 7 must be safe, i.e., not T=6,7,8.\n\nWith H=10, time from 1 to 10, we can be on row 7 at T=7,8,9,10? But at T=10, y10=9, not on row 7.\n\nOn row 7 at T=7,8, or 9.\n\nT=7 and 8 are dangerous, T=9 is safe.\n\nSo we can be on row 7 at T=9.\n\nThen y9=7.\n\nThen from start, to reach y9=7 at T=9.\n\nWith 9 actions (t=0 to 8), y9=7.\n\nThen at t=9, action U, y10=8 at T=10? y10=8, but we need y10=9.\n\ny10 = position at time 10.\n\nIf y9=7, then action a9 at t=9: if U, y10=8; if S, y10=7; if D, y10=6.\n\nNone is 9.\n\nTo reach y10=9, we need y9=8 or 9.\n\nIf y9=8, then a9=U, y10=9.\n\nIf y9=9, a9=S, y10=9.\n\nBut we need to be on row 7 at some T.\n\nIf y9=8, then at T=9, on row 8? Position at time 9 is y9.\n\nIf y9=8, on row 8 at T=9.\n\nWe were on row 7 at some earlier time, like T=8 or T=7.\n\nFor example, if we go up, at T=7, y7=7, or T=8, y8=7 or 8.\n\nBut T=7 and T=8 are dangerous for row 7.\n\nIf we reach row 7 at T=9, but if y9=7, then at T=9 on row 7, safe, but then y10=8, not 9.\n\nSo with H=10, we cannot be on row 7 at T=9 and reach y10=9; we can only be on row 7 at T=9 if we delay, but then to go to 9 takes more time.\n\nLet's list possible paths with H=10.\n\nActions from t=0 to t=9, 10 actions, y10=9.\n\ny10 = U - D, and U + D + S =10, U - D =9.\n\nThen U - D =9, U + D + S =10.\n\nAdd: 2U + S =19, subtract: 2D + S =1.\n\nSince 2D + S =1, D and S non-negative integers, possible D=0, S=1; or D=1, S=-1 impossible, so only D=0, S=1, then U=9.\n\nSo exactly 9 U, 0 D, 1 S.\n\nSo we have one stay action.\n\nNow, the stay can be at different times.\n\nWe need to avoid being on row 7 at T=7 or T=8.\n\nIn the sequence, we are on row 7 at time T when y_T=7.\n\ny_T=7 for some T between 1 and 9, since at T=0, y=0; T=10, y=9.\n\nT from 1 to 9.\n\ny_T=7 at some T.\n\nNow, for row 7 to be safe, we need T not 6,7,8? Row 7 dangerous at T=6,7,8.\n\nT=6,7,8 dangerous.\n\nBut T is time, y_T= row.\n\nAt time T, if y_T=7, it must not be T=6,7,8.\n\nSimilarly for other rows.\n\nNow, with the path, we have one stay.\n\nThe stay can be used to delay or something.\n\nFor example, if we stay at some row to avoid being on row 7 at T=7.\n\nSuppose we are at row 6 at some time.\n\nIn the all-up path, at T=6, y=6.\n\nThen if we stay at t=6, a6=S, then y7=6, so at T=7, y=6, not 7.\n\nThen at t=7, action U, a7=U, y8=7 at T=8.\n\nBut at T=8, on row 7, which is dangerous (T=8 is danger time).\n\nNot good.\n\nAt t=7, action S, y8=6, then at T=8, y=6, then later go up.\n\nBut then we need to reach y=9 at T=10.\n\nFor example, from T=8, y=6, we need to go to y=9 in two steps? y10=9.\n\nFrom y8, after actions at t=8 and t=9.\n\ny8 to y9 to y10.\n\nIf y8=6, then y9 = y8 + Δy8, so 5,6,7; then y10 = y9 + Δy9, so if y9=7, y10=6,7,8; not 9.\n\nIf y9=8, y10=7,8,9; so if y10=9, need y9=8 and a9=U.\n\nBut y9=8 requires from y8, if y8=6, y9=7 or 8, so possible y9=8 if a8=U twice? No, one action.\n\na8 at t=8 sets y9 = y8 + Δy8.\n\nIf y8=6, a8=U, y9=7; a8=S, y9=6; a8=D, y9=5.\n\nCannot get y9=8 from y8=6.\n\nSo if at T=8, y8=6, then y9 <=7, y10<=8 <9, cannot reach y10=9.\n\nSimilarly, if y8=7, then y9=6,7,8; y10=5,6,7,8,9. If y9=8, a9=U, y10=9.\n\nBut y9=8 requires from y8=7, a8=U, y9=8.\n\nThen y10=9 with a9=U.\n\nBut at T=8, if y8=7, on row 7, dangerous if T=8.\n\nIn this case, with the stay, we might have y8=7.\n\nLet's think differently.\n\nWe need to be on row 7 at T=5, but impossible, or at T=9.\n\nAt T=9, if y9=7, then we can be on row 7 safely, but then to reach y10=9, we need y10=9, which requires y9=8 or 9, not 7.\n\nSo if y9=7, y10=8 max.\n\nThus with H=10, we cannot have y9=7 and y10=9; we must have y9=8 or 9.\n\nIf y9=8, then we were on row 7 at T=8 or T=7 or earlier.\n\nT=8 and T=7 are both dangerous times for row 7.\n\nIf we are on row 7 at T=9, but y9=8 or 9, not 7.\n\nSo with H=10, we must be on row 7 at some T between 1 and 8, but for T=7 or 8, dangerous, and for T<7, we may not reach.\n\nFor example, if we are on row 7 at T=6, but T=6 is dangerous for row 7.\n\nSimilarly, T=5 impossible.\n\nSo the only possible times to be on row 7 with H=10 are T=6,7,8, all of which are dangerous for row 7.\n\nT=6: if y6=7, but with actions, earliest y6=6 with all U, y6=6 at T=6.\n\nTo have y6=7, need 7 up moves in 6 actions? Actions from t=0 to t=5, 6 actions, y6 <=6, so y6=6 max, cannot be 7.\n\nSimilarly, y7=7 at T=7, with 7 actions.\n\nSo for T=6, y6 <=6, so on row at most 6.\n\nAt T=7, y7 <=7, can be 7.\n\nAt T=8, y8 <=8, can be 7.\n\nAt T=9, y9 <=9, can be 7.\n\nBut with H=10, y10=9, so y9=8 or 9.\n\nIf y9=8, then at T=9, on row 8, not 7.\n\nWe were on row 7 at some earlier time, which must be T=7 or T=8, since at T=6, y6<=6, not 7.\n\nSo at T=7 or T=8, we are on row 7 if we pass through it.\n\nAnd both T=7 and T=8 are dangerous for row 7.\n\nTherefore, with H=10, it is impossible to avoid being on row 7 at a dangerous time, because the only times we can be on row 7 are T=7 and T=8 for a direct path, but both dangerous.\n\nWith one stay, we might be on row 7 at T=7 or T=8 still.\n\nFor example, if we stay at an earlier time, we might arrive later.\n\nSuppose we stay at some point before.\n\nFor example, start: a0=S at t=0, but y0=0, a0=S, y1=0, then at T=1, on row 0, safe but not progress.\n\nThen we need to go up later.\n\nBut then to reach y10=9, we need 9 U and one S, so net progress same.\n\nBut the time when we are on row 7 might be delayed.\n\nFor instance, if we stay at t=0: a0=S, y1=0\n\nThen a1=U, y2=1\n\na2=U, y3=2\n\na3=U, y4=3\n\na4=U, y5=4\n\na5=U, y6=5\n\na6=U, y7=6\n\na7=U, y8=7 at T=8\n\nAt T=8, on row 7, dangerous.\n\na8=U, y9=8\n\na9=U, y10=9\n\nBut at T=8, collision.\n\nIf we stay later.\n\nSuppose at t=5, we are at y5, in all-up, y5=5 at T=5.\n\nIf a5=S, then y6=5 at T=6\n\nThen a6=U, y7=6 at T=7\n\na7=U, y8=7 at T=8\n\nAgain at T=8, on row 7, dangerous.\n\na8=U, y9=8\n\na9=U, y10=9\n\nSame issue.\n\nIf we stay at t=6: a6=S, y7=6 at T=7\n\nThen a7=U, y8=7 at T=8, dangerous.\n\nOr a7=S, y8=6, then a8=U, y9=7 at T=9\n\nThen at T=9, on row 7, safe.\n\nThen a9=U, y10=8, but y10=8, not 9. We need y10=9.\n\nTo have y10=9, from y9=7, we need two U, but only one action left, a9, so y10=8 max, not 9.\n\nSo cannot reach y10=9 if y9=7.\n\nThus, with H=10, it is impossible to both reach y10=9 and avoid being on row 7 at T=7 or T=8, which are dangerous.\n\nTherefore, min H cannot be 10; must be larger.\n\nNow with H=11, we can reach y11=9.\n\nActions from t=0 to t=10, 11 actions.\n\ny11 = U - D =9, U + D + S =11.\n\nU - D =9, U + D + S =11.\n\nAdd: 2U + S =20, subtract: 2D + S =2.\n\nPossible solutions: S even, etc.\n\n2D + S =2, so (D,S) = (0,2), (1,0)\n\nIf D=0, S=2, then U=9\n\nIf D=1, S=0, then U=10\n\nSo either 9U and 2S, or 10U and 1D.\n\nNow, we need to avoid row 7 at T=6,7,8.\n\nWe can be on row 7 at T=9, for example.\n\nWith 9U and 2S, we can have y9=7, then go to y11=9.\n\nFor instance.\n\ny9=7, then at T=9, on row 7, safe.\n\nThen actions: a9=U, y10=8 at T=10\n\nThen a10=U, y11=9 at T=11\n\nNow, at T=10, on row 8, safe since danger at 12-14.\n\nNow, we need to reach y9=7 at T=9 with 9 actions? Actions to set y9: from t=0 to t=8, 9 actions.\n\ny9 = U - D for those 9 actions.\n\nBut we have total 11 actions for y11, but to reach y9.\n\nWith 9 actions (t=0 to 8), we need y9=7.\n\nThen U - D =7 for first 9 actions, and U + D + S =9 for first 9 actions.\n\nThen later two U.\n\nNow U - D =7, U + D + S =9.\n\nAdd: 2U + S =16, subtract: 2D + S =2.\n\nSo (D,S) = (0,2), (1,0)\n\nIf D=0, S=2, U=7\n\nIf D=1, S=0, U=8\n\nNow, with U=7, D=0, S=2, y9=7.\n\nOr U=8, D=1, S=0, y9=7.\n\nNow, we need to avoid other dangerous times.\n\nFor example, rows 3,4,5 dangerous at T=0,1,2.\n\nSo we should not be on row 3,4,5 at T=0,1,2.\n\nBut T=0, y=0, not on row.\n\nT=1 and T=2, we might be on low rows.\n\nSimilarly, row 6 only dangerous at T=2, so avoid row 6 at T=2.\n\nNow, let's find a sequence.\n\nStart at t=0, y0=0.\n\nWe need to reach y9=7 with 9 actions.\n\nOne option: 7U and 2S.\n\nWe can place the stays to avoid dangers.\n\nFor example, to avoid being on row 3,4,5 at T=1 and T=2.\n\nAt T=1, if y1=1, row 1 safe.\n\nT=2, if y2=2, row 2 safe.\n\nBut if we go up, y1=1, y2=2, both safe.\n\nThen at T=3, we can be on row 3, which is safe after T=2.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut we need to have y9=7.\n\nWith 7U and 2S in 9 actions, net +7.\n\nNow, the stays can be at safe positions.\n\nAlso, avoid row 6 at T=2, but at T=2, if we are on row 2, not 6.\n\nNow, row 7 we will be at T=9, safe.\n\nNow, let's outline the sequence.\n\nActions:\n\nt=0: a0=U, y1=1 at T=1\n\nT=1: row 1, safe\n\nt=1: a1=U, y2=2 at T=2\n\nT=2: row 2, safe\n\nt=2: a2=U, y3=3 at T=3\n\nT=3: row 3, dangerous at 0,1,2, T=3>2 safe\n\nt=3: a3=U, y4=4 at T=4\n\nT=4: row 4, safe (danger only 0,1,2)\n\nt=4: a4=U, y5=5 at T=5\n\nT=5: row 5, safe\n\nt=5: a5=U, y6=6 at T=6\n\nT=6: row 6, safe (only danger T=2)\n\nNow we have used 6 actions, y6=6.\n\nWe need to reach y9=7 with 3 more actions (t=6,7,8).\n\nBut y6=6, to y9=7, we need net +1, so with 3 actions, we can have, for example, one U and two S, or one U, one D, one U, but net +1.\n\nBut we need exactly y9=7.\n\nSince we will have two S later, but here for the first part.\n\nIn this segment, to go from y6=6 to y9=7 in 3 actions.\n\nSo possible: S,S,U or S,U,S or U,S,S etc., but y9=7.\n\nAlso, during T=6,7,8, we need to avoid row 7 danger, but we are not on row 7 yet.\n\nAt t=6, we are on y6=6.\n\nTake a6=S, then y7=6, at T=7 on row 6, safe\n\nThen a7=S, y8=6, at T=8 on row 6, safe\n\nThen a8=U, y9=7 at T=9, on row 7, safe (T=9>8)\n\nPerfect.\n\nThen now, from here, to reach y11=9.\n\nAt t=9, we have y9=7.\n\nThen a9=U, y10=8 at T=10\n\nT=10: row 8, dangerous at 12,13,14, T=10<12, safe\n\nThen a10=U, y11=9 at T=11\n\nNow, we have used 11 actions: t=0 to t=10.\n\nActions: from t=0 to t=8: 9 actions, with 7U and 2S? Let's list:\n\nt=0: U\n\nt=1: U\n\nt=2: U\n\nt=3: U\n\nt=4: U\n\nt=5: U  // so far 6U, y6=6\n\nt=6: S  // y7=6\n\nt=7: S  // y8=6\n\nt=8: U  // y9=7\n\nNow t=9: U  // y10=8\n\nt=10: U  // y11=9\n\nActions: U,U,U,U,U,U,S,S,U,U,U\n\nNow number of U: t0,1,2,3,4,5,8,9,10: 9U\n\nS: t6 and t7: 2S\n\nD:0\n\nNow positions over time:\n\nT=0: y=0 (start)\n\nAfter a0: T=1, y=1\n\nT=2, y=2\n\nT=3, y=3\n\nT=4, y=4\n\nT=5, y=5\n\nT=6, y=6\n\nT=7, y=6 (after a6=S)\n\nT=8, y=6 (after a7=S)\n\nT=9, y=7 (after a8=U)\n\nT=10, y=8 (after a9=U)\n\nT=11, y=9 (after a10=U)\n\nNow check collisions:\n\nT=1: y=1, row 1, dangerous times 12-14, not now, safe\n\nT=2: y=2, row 2, dangerous 12-14, safe\n\nT=3: y=3, row 3, dangerous 0,1,2, T=3>2, safe\n\nT=4: y=4, row 4, dangerous 0,1,2, safe\n\nT=5: y=5, row 5, dangerous 0,1,2, safe\n\nT=6: y=6, row 6, dangerous only T=2, not now, safe\n\nT=7: y=6, row 6, safe\n\nT=8: y=6, row 6, safe\n\nT=9: y=7, row 7, dangerous times 6,7,8, T=9>8, safe\n\nT=10: y=8, row 8, dangerous 12-14, T=10<12, safe\n\nT=11: y=9, goal, not a freeway.\n\nAll safe.\n\nH=11, with 11 actions.\n\nBut is there a shorter path?\n\nEarlier with H=10 impossible, so min H=11.\n\nBut we used 9U and 2S, but we could have 10U and 1D.\n\nFor example, go down once to avoid something, but might not be better.\n\nFor instance, if we go down at some point, but that would require more up later, so H might be same or larger.\n\nSince min is 11, we can use this sequence.\n\nIn the sequence, we have two S at t=6 and t=7.\n\nBut we could place the stays earlier, but it should be fine.\n\nNow, the sequence of actions:\n\nFrom t=0 to t=10:\n\na0: U\n\na1: U\n\na2: U\n\na3: U\n\na4: U\n\na5: U\n\na6: S\n\na7: S\n\na8: U\n\na9: U\n\na10: U\n\nIn terms of the turn: current turn is t1=0.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 0: U\n\nTurn 1: U\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: S\n\nTurn 7: S\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nAfter a10 at turn 10, y11=9 at time 11.\n\nH=11 actions.\n\nIn the answer, it should be the sequence for t=0 to H-1=10.\n\nNow, to write in the box.\n\nBut let's confirm if we can do with less.\n\nSuppose we use the D option.\n\nWith 10U and 1D.\n\nBut U-D=9, so if we go down once, we need extra up to compensate, but with 10U and 1D, U-D=9, yes.\n\nFor example, go down at some safe point.\n\nBut we still need to avoid row 7 at T=7,8.\n\nIf we go down, we might be slower.\n\nFor instance, suppose at some point we go down to row 5 or something, but row 5 is safe after T=2.\n\nBut then to reach y=9, we need net +9, with 10U and 1D, we have +9, but we might be on row 7 later or earlier.\n\nFor example, if we go down at t=5, suppose.\n\nBut at t=5, in all-up, y5=5, if a5=D, y6=4, then we need to go up more.\n\nThen we might be on row 7 at T=8 or something.\n\nBut T=8 dangerous.\n\nIf we delay, we can be on row 7 at T=9.\n\nFor example: start U,U,U,U,U to y5=5 at T=5.\n\nThen a5=D? But row 5 safe, but going down.\n\na5=D, y6=4 at T=6\n\nThen a6=U, y7=5 at T=7\n\na7=U, y8=6 at T=8\n\na8=U, y9=7 at T=9\n\nThen at T=9, on row 7, safe.\n\nBut we have y9=7, need to go to y11=9, but with H=10, we stop at y10.\n\nIn this case for H=11, we can continue.\n\nBut with 10U and 1D, we can have shorter? No, H=11 same.\n\nIn this sequence, we have a down, but we reach y9=7 at T=9, same as before.\n\nThen a9=U, y10=8, a10=U, y11=9.\n\nBut we used one D, so we have 10U and 1D, but in positions, we have extra steps.\n\nIn terms of H, same.\n\nBut with the first sequence, no down, just stay, which might be simpler.\n\nAnd we avoided all dangers.\n\nNow, back to row 6 at T=2: in our sequence, at T=2, we were on row 2, not row 6, so no issue.\n\nSimilarly, no other dangers.\n\nSo min H=11.\n\nNow, the sequence:\n\nTurn 0: U\n\nTurn 1: U\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: S\n\nTurn 7: S\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nIn the answer format, it should be listed as:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 0: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 1: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 2: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 3: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 4: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 5: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: & S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: & S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: & U \\end{array} }\n\nBut let's write it properly.\n\nSince t1=0, and turns from t1 to t1+H-1=10.\n\nH=11.\n\nIn the sequence, it should be actions for each turn.\n\nYes.\n\nTo save space, but I think this is fine.\n\nNote that at turn 6 and 7, we stay to avoid moving to row 7 during danger times.\n\nThen at turn 8, we go up to row 7 at T=9, safe.\n\nThen up to 8 and 9.\n\nAll good.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from \\((0, 0)\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) is 11.

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t=6, and I start at y=0. I can move up, down, or stay each turn, but since I need to go up to 9, down might not be useful except to avoid cars.\n\nFirst, I should understand where the cars are at each future turn and how they move. The cars are on freeways 1 through 8, and each has a head, tail, direction, and speed. Direction \"right\" means they're moving to the right, so their position increases over time. \"Left\" means moving left, position decreases.\n\nThe collision rule: I collide at turn T if, when I'm on freeway y_T, for that freeway, 0 is in the car's span at that turn. Also, when I move, I'm not on the new row until the next turn, so at turn T, I'm on y_T, and I decide to go to y_{T+1}, but at turn T, I'm still on y_T, so I only care about cars on y_T at that turn.\n\nLet me denote the turn number relative to t_1. Set τ = 0 at t_1 = 6, so at τ=0, I'm at y=0.\n\nI need to find a sequence of actions for τ=0 to H-1 such that at τ=H-1, y=9.\n\nSince I start at y=0 and need to reach y=9, and I can only change y by -1, 0, or +1 each turn, the minimum number of turns if there were no cars would be 9 turns to go from 0 to 9, each step up. But with cars, I might need to stay or move down sometimes to avoid collisions.\n\nFirst, let's list all the cars and their positions at τ=0 (t=6).\n\nFor each freeway, there are cars listed:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: head -48, tail -59, direction right, speed 4. Since direction right, at τ=0, span is [τ, h] but in the car update, for right-moving, it says Span(t1) = [τ, h] → at T, [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nIn the table, it says \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nAnd for right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] → at T, [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT]\n\nSimilarly, left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT]\n\nIn the collision, we care about whether 0 is in the span at a given turn for the freeway I'm on.\n\nAt τ=0 (t=6), for each freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: car with tail τ=-59, head h=-48, direction right, speed 4. So at τ=0, span is [τ, h] = [-59, -48], so positions from -59 to -48. Since moving right, at time Δτ after τ=0, span is [-59 + 4Δτ, -48 + 4Δτ]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same as freeway 1? It says (-48,-59,right,4) but head and tail, which is which? In the notation, it's (head, tail, direction, speed), I think.\n\nLook: for freeway 1: \"(-48, -59, right, 4)\"\n\nAnd in the car update, for right-moving, Span(t1) = [τ, h], so τ is tail, h is head? But here it's listed as (head, tail), I think it's inconsistent.\n\nCheck the car state table:\n\n\" Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s) \"\n\nSo for freeway 1: head h = -48, tail τ = -59, direction right, speed 4.\n\nFor right-moving, the span is [tail, head] = [τ, h] = [-59, -48]\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, it would be [head, tail], but for now, all except one are right-moving.\n\nFreeway 6 has left-moving: (48,83,left,36), so head=48, tail=83? But for left-moving, head should be the front when moving left, so if moving left, head is larger, tail smaller, but span [h, τ] with h > τ.\n\nIn this case, head=48, tail=83, but 48 < 83, so if moving left, head should be the leftmost point? Let's see the direction.\n\nDirection left, so moving left, so at t1, span [h, τ] = [48,83], but 48 to 83, that's increasing, but moving left? That doesn't make sense.\n\nPerhaps I have the head and tail confused.\n\nLet's read the car update carefully.\n\nFor car on freeway i, at turn t1, head at h, tail at τ.\n\nThen for left-moving: span(t1) = [h, τ] and at T, span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nFor right-moving: span(t1) = [τ, h] and at T, [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nIn both cases, the span is from min to max, but with head and tail defined relative to direction.\n\nFor right-moving, tail is left end, head is right end.\n\nFor left-moving, head is right end, tail is left end? Let's see.\n\nFor left-moving, span(t1) = [h, τ], and at T, [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT], so if h and τ, with h being head, τ tail, and moving left, so h decreases, τ decreases.\n\nIn the example for freeway 6: (48,83,left,36)\n\nSo head=48, tail=83, direction left.\n\nBut 48 to 83, that's from 48 to 83, which is to the right, but moving left, so at t1, it's at high position, moving left.\n\nAt t1, span [h, τ] = [48,83], so positions from 48 to 83, and since moving left, at later time, it decreases.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving, tail is left, head is right.\n\nIn the collision check, we care if 0 is in the span at turn T for the freeway.\n\nAlso, the freeway is horizontal, I assume, and x=0 is the point we care about for collision.\n\nNow, back to the cars at τ=0 (t=6).\n\nList for each freeway the cars and their span evolution.\n\nSet Δτ = τ, so at time τ from now, which is t = 6 + τ.\n\nFor freeway 1: car: tail τ_c = -59, head h_c = -48, direction right, speed 4.\n\nSpan at time τ: for right-moving, [τ_c + 4τ, h_c + 4τ] = [-59 + 4τ, -48 + 4τ]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same as freeway 1: head -48, tail -59, right, speed 4, so span [-59 +4τ, -48 +4τ]\n\nFreeway 3: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (48,37,right,4) — head=48, tail=37? For right-moving, span should be [tail, head], so if tail=37, head=48, so [37,48] at τ=0.\n\nBut in the list, it's (head, tail) = (48,37), so head=48, tail=37, direction right, so since right-moving, span at t1 is [τ, h] = [37,48]\n\nThen at τ, [37 +4τ, 48 +4τ]\n\nSecond car on freeway 3: (0,-11,right,4), so head=0, tail=-11, right, span at t1: [ -11, 0 ]\n\nAt τ: [-11 +4τ, 0 +4τ] = [-11+4τ, 4τ]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 4: same as freeway 3? Two cars: (48,37,right,4) and (0,-11,right,4), so same spans: [37+4τ,48+4τ] and [-11+4τ,4τ]\n\nFreeway 5: same as 3 and 4? (48,37,right,4) and (0,-11,right,4), so identical to freeway 3 and 4.\n\nFreeway 6: (48,83,left,36) — head=48, tail=83, direction left.\n\nFor left-moving, span at t1: [h, τ] = [48,83]\n\nAt τ: [48 - 36τ, 83 - 36τ]\n\nFreeway 7: three cars: (48,37,right,4), (12,1,right,4), (-24,-35,right,4)\n\nFirst car: head=48, tail=37, right, span at τ: [37+4τ, 48+4τ]\n\nSecond car: head=12, tail=1, right, span at τ: [1+4τ, 12+4τ]\n\nThird car: head=-24, tail=-35, right, span at τ: [-35+4τ, -24+4τ]\n\nFreeway 8: (-48,-59,right,4), same as freeway 1 and 2: span [-59+4τ, -48+4τ]\n\nNow, I start at y=0 at τ=0, and I need to go to y=9.\n\nAt each turn τ, I am at some y_τ, and I choose action to go to y_{τ+1}, but at turn τ, I am on y_τ, so I collide if for freeway y_τ, at that turn, 0 is in some car's span on that freeway.\n\nAlso, when I move, at turn τ, I am on y_τ before moving, so for the action, I am on y_τ at the beginning of the turn, I choose action, then I move to y_{τ+1} for the next turn.\n\nBut the collision is checked at the turn when I am on that row.\n\nSpecifically: at turn T, I am on row y_T, and I collide if 0 is in the span of any car on freeway y_T at turn T.\n\nThen after that, I move to y_{T+1} based on action.\n\nNow, I need to find a path from y=0 at τ=0 to y=9 at some τ=H-1, with minimal H.\n\nSince I start at y=0 and need y=9, and rows 1-8 have cars, I must go through rows 1 to 8, but I can stay or move down to avoid being on a row when a car is at 0.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, I assume, since no cars there, only freeways 1-8 have cars.\n\nThe grid has y=0 to y=9, freeways are y=1 to y=8 for cars.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are not freeways, so no cars, so I am safe when on y=0 or y=9.\n\nAt τ=0, I am on y=0, which is safe.\n\nI need to reach (0,9), so y=9, which is safe.\n\nNow, the cars move, so I need to see for each row and each time, if there is a car at x=0.\n\nFor a given freeway k and time τ, collision occurs if for some car on row k, 0 is in its span at τ.\n\nSo for each row, I need to find when 0 is covered by a car.\n\nLet's do that for each freeway.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: only one car, span [ -59 +4τ, -48 +4τ ]\n\n0 in span if -59 +4τ ≤ 0 ≤ -48 +4τ\n\nSo -59 +4τ ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ -48 +4τ\n\nFirst inequality: 4τ ≤ 59, τ ≤ 59/4 = 14.75, so τ ≤ 14 since τ integer\n\nSecond inequality: 0 ≤ -48 +4τ, so 48 ≤ 4τ, τ ≥ 12\n\nSo for τ from 12 to 14 inclusive, 0 in span, collision if on row 1 at those times.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same as freeway 1, so collision at τ=12,13,14.\n\nNow freeway 3: two cars.\n\nFirst car: span [37+4τ, 48+4τ]\n\n0 in this? 37+4τ ≤ 0 ≤ 48+4τ? 37+4τ ≤0 implies τ ≤ -37/4 = -9.25, impossible since τ≥0. So never.\n\nSecond car: span [-11+4τ, 4τ]\n\n0 in span if -11+4τ ≤ 0 ≤ 4τ\n\nFirst: -11+4τ ≤0, 4τ ≤11, τ≤11/4=2.75, τ≤2\n\nSecond: 0≤4τ, always for τ≥0\n\nSo for τ=0,1,2: at τ=0, span [-11,0], 0 is included? -11+0= -11 ≤0≤0, yes, 0 is the upper bound.\n\nSimilarly τ=1: [-11+4,4] = [-7,4], 0 in it.\n\nτ=2: [-11+8,8] = [-3,8], 0 in it.\n\nτ=3: [-11+12,12] = [1,12], 0 not in [1,12]\n\nSo for second car, collision at τ=0,1,2.\n\nBut freeway 3 has two cars, but the first one never has 0, so only second car matters.\n\nSo freeway 3: collision at τ=0,1,2.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 4: same cars as freeway 3, so collision at τ=0,1,2.\n\nFreeway 5: same, collision at τ=0,1,2.\n\nNow freeway 6: one car, left-moving, head=48, tail=83, direction left, speed 36.\n\nSpan at τ: [48 - 36τ, 83 - 36τ]\n\n0 in span if 48 -36τ ≤ 0 ≤ 83 -36τ\n\nFirst: 48 -36τ ≤0, 48≤36τ, τ≥48/36=4/3≈1.333, so τ≥2 since integer\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ 83 -36τ, 36τ ≤83, τ≤83/36≈2.305, so τ≤2\n\nτ≥2 and τ≤2, so only τ=2.\n\nAt τ=2: [48-72,83-72] = [-24,11], 0 in [-24,11], yes.\n\nτ=1: [48-36,83-36] = [12,47], 0 not in.\n\nτ=3: [48-108,83-108] = [-60,-25], 0 not in.\n\nSo freeway 6: collision only at τ=2.\n\nNow freeway 7: three cars.\n\nFirst car: (48,37,right,4) span [37+4τ, 48+4τ]\n\n0 in? 37+4τ ≤0 ≤48+4τ? Left: 37+4τ≤0, τ≤ -37/4, impossible. Never.\n\nSecond car: (12,1,right,4) span [1+4τ, 12+4τ]\n\n0 in? 1+4τ ≤0 ≤12+4τ? Left: 1+4τ≤0, τ≤ -1/4, impossible. Never, since 1+4τ ≥1 >0 for τ≥0.\n\nThird car: (-24,-35,right,4) span [-35+4τ, -24+4τ]\n\n0 in? -35+4τ ≤0 ≤ -24+4τ\n\nFirst: -35+4τ≤0, 4τ≤35, τ≤35/4=8.75, τ≤8\n\nSecond: 0≤ -24+4τ, 4τ≥24, τ≥6\n\nSo for τ from 6 to 8 inclusive, 0 in span.\n\nNow, freeway 7 has only this car that can have 0, since others never.\n\nAt τ=6: span [-35+24, -24+24] = [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nτ=7: [-35+28, -24+28] = [-7,4], 0 in.\n\nτ=8: [-35+32, -24+32] = [-3,8], 0 in.\n\nτ=9: [-35+36, -24+36] = [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo freeway 7: collision at τ=6,7,8.\n\nBut τ=6 is current time? τ is from now, t=6+τ.\n\nAt τ=0, t=6, but freeway 7 at τ=0: third car span [-35, -24], 0 not in, since -24 <0? -35 to -24, both negative, so 0 not in. Collision starts at τ=6? τ=6 corresponds to t=12.\n\nτ=0: t=6, τ=6: t=12.\n\nNow freeway 8: similar to 1 and 2, span [-59+4τ, -48+4τ]\n\n0 in: -59+4τ ≤0 ≤ -48+4τ\n\nτ≥12 and τ≤14, as before.\n\nτ≥12, τ≤14.\n\nNow, summarize for each row, the times when I cannot be on that row due to collision.\n\nRow 1: unsafe at τ=12,13,14\n\nRow 2: unsafe at τ=12,13,14 (same as row 1)\n\nRow 3: unsafe at τ=0,1,2\n\nBut τ=0 is now, and I'm at y=0, not on row 3, so for future, but at τ=0, row 3 is unsafe, but I'm not there.\n\nRow 4: unsafe at τ=0,1,2\n\nRow 5: unsafe at τ=0,1,2\n\nRow 6: unsafe at τ=2\n\nRow 7: unsafe at τ=6,7,8\n\nRow 8: unsafe at τ=12,13,14\n\nNow, I start at y=0 at τ=0.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\nThe minimal path would be to go up as fast as possible, but I need to avoid being on a row when it is unsafe.\n\nAlso, since I can stay or move down, I might need to wait sometimes.\n\nNow, let's think about the sequence.\n\nAt τ=0, I am at y=0, safe.\n\nI choose action: U, D, or S.\n\nIf I go up, to y=1 at τ=1.\n\nBut at τ=0, row 1: is it unsafe? For row 1, unsafe at τ=12,13,14, not at τ=0. At τ=0, row 1 has no car at 0? Let's check.\n\nFor row 1, car span at τ=0: [-59,-48], 0 not in, so safe at τ=0.\n\nSimilarly, row 1 unsafe only at τ=12,13,14.\n\nSimilarly for other rows.\n\nAt τ=0, all rows except 3,4,5 are safe, but 3,4,5 unsafe at τ=0,1,2.\n\nSpecifically, row 3,4,5 unsafe at τ=0,1,2.\n\nBut at τ=0, I am on y=0, not on those rows.\n\nNow, I need to plan when to be on each row.\n\nSince I start from 0 and go to 9, and rows 3,4,5 are blocked at early times, I might need to go quickly or wait.\n\nSimilarly, row 6 has a problem at τ=2, row 7 at τ=6,7,8, rows 1,2,8 at τ=12-14.\n\nτ=12-14 is late, but since I start early, I might reach before that if I move fast.\n\nMinimal time: if no cars, from y=0 to y=9 in 9 steps: at τ=0 y=0, after 9 actions, at τ=9 y=9.\n\nBut with cars, I might need to take more time.\n\nNow, let's see the constraints.\n\nFirst, rows 3,4,5 are unsafe from τ=0 to τ=2 inclusive. So I cannot be on row 3,4, or 5 at τ=0,1,2.\n\nSimilarly, row 6 unsafe at τ=2 only.\n\nRow 7 unsafe at τ=6,7,8.\n\nRows 1 and 2 unsafe at τ=12,13,14; row 8 unsafe at same times.\n\nSince τ=12-14 is late, and I start at τ=0, I should be able to reach y=9 before τ=12, if possible.\n\nMinimal time is 9 turns, so at τ=9, I could be at y=9.\n\nNow, check if I can go directly up without delay.\n\nSuppose I go up every turn.\n\nAt τ=0: start y=0, safe.\n\nAction U, to y=1 at τ=1.\n\nAt τ=1, I am on y=1.\n\nIs y=1 safe at τ=1? Row 1 unsafe only at τ=12,13,14, so at τ=1, safe.\n\nThen at τ=1, action U, to y=2 at τ=2.\n\nAt τ=2, on y=2.\n\nRow 2 unsafe at τ=12,13,14, not at τ=2, so safe.\n\nAction U, to y=3 at τ=3.\n\nAt τ=3, on y=3.\n\nNow, row 3 is unsafe only at τ=0,1,2. At τ=3, is it safe?\n\nFor row 3, unsafe at τ=0,1,2, so at τ=3, should be safe.\n\nAt τ=3, car spans: for row 3, second car span at τ: [-11+4τ, 4τ]\n\nAt τ=3: [-11+12,12] = [1,12], 0 not in, so yes safe.\n\nSimilarly, no other cars, so row 3 safe at τ=3.\n\nThen action U to y=4 at τ=4.\n\nAt τ=4, on y=4.\n\nRow 4: similar to row 3, unsafe only at τ=0,1,2, so at τ=4 safe.\n\nAction U to y=5 at τ=5.\n\nAt τ=5, on y=5.\n\nRow 5: same, unsafe τ=0,1,2, safe at τ=5.\n\nAction U to y=6 at τ=6.\n\nAt τ=6, on y=6.\n\nNow, row 6 unsafe at τ=2, but not at τ=6? Earlier we have row 6 unsafe only at τ=2.\n\nAt τ=6, car on row 6: left-moving, span [48-36τ, 83-36τ]\n\nAt τ=6: [48-216, 83-216] = [-168,-133], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nYes.\n\nAction U to y=7 at τ=7.\n\nAt τ=7, on y=7.\n\nNow row 7 unsafe at τ=6,7,8.\n\nAt τ=7, it is unsafe!\n\nBecause row 7 has collision at τ=6,7,8.\n\nAt τ=7, if I am on row 7, I collide.\n\nBut in the sequence, at τ=6 I was on y=6, then I go up to y=7 at τ=7.\n\nAt turn τ=7, I am on y_7, which is y=7, and row 7 is unsafe at τ=7.\n\nSo collision.\n\nTherefore, I cannot be on row 7 at τ=7.\n\nBut in this path, I am on row 7 at τ=7, which is unsafe.\n\nSo I need to avoid that.\n\nPerhaps I can stay or move down, but I need to go up.\n\nAt τ=7, row 7 is unsafe, so I should not be on it at that time.\n\nSimilarly, it is unsafe at τ=6,7,8.\n\nNow, in the direct path, I arrive at y=6 at τ=6.\n\nAt τ=6, row 6 is safe, as above.\n\nBut if I go up to y=7 at τ=7, I collide at τ=7.\n\nI could stay on y=6 at τ=6 and not move.\n\nBut at τ=6, I am on y=6, which is safe.\n\nThen at τ=6, I choose action S, stay, so at τ=7, I am still on y=6.\n\nThen at τ=7, on y=6, row 6 safe at τ=7? Row 6 unsafe only at τ=2, so at τ=7, safe.\n\nThen at τ=7, I can go up to y=7.\n\nBut at τ=7, if I go to y=7, at turn τ=7, I am on y=7, which is unsafe.\n\nProblem.\n\nWhen I am at turn τ, I am on y_τ.\n\nIf I choose action to go to y_{τ+1}, but at turn τ, I am on y_τ.\n\nFor example, at τ=6, I am on y_6.\n\nIf I choose action U, I will be at y_7 at τ=7.\n\nBut at turn τ=6, I am on y_6, which is safe.\n\nAt turn τ=7, I am on y_7.\n\nNow, y_7 is row 7, and at τ=7, it is unsafe, so if I am on it at τ=7, I collide.\n\nTo avoid collision at τ=7 on row 7, I must not be on row 7 at τ=7.\n\nSimilarly, I could be on row 6 or row 8, but row 8 might be unsafe or not.\n\nAt τ=7, row 6 is safe, row 8: unsafe at τ=12-14, not at τ=7, so safe.\n\nBut I need to go to row 7 eventually.\n\nSince row 7 is unsafe from τ=6 to τ=8, I need to be on row 7 before τ=6 or after τ=8.\n\nSimilarly for other times.\n\nNow, back to the path.\n\nI can reach y=6 at τ=6 safely, as in the direct path up to there.\n\nAt τ=6, y=6.\n\nNow, row 7 is unsafe at τ=6,7,8.\n\nSo I cannot be on row 7 at τ=6,7,8.\n\nTherefore, I must be on row 7 at some other time.\n\nFor example, I could be on row 7 before τ=6 or after τ=8.\n\nBut since I start from below, and at τ=6 I am at y=6, I can go to row 7 only after τ=6.\n\nAfter τ=8, row 7 is safe.\n\nτ=9 and after.\n\nBut I need to go up to row 8 and 9.\n\nAt τ=6, I am at y=6.\n\nI cannot go up to y=7 immediately because at τ=7 I would be on y=7 which is unsafe.\n\nIf I stay on y=6 at τ=6, then at τ=7 I am on y=6, safe.\n\nThen at τ=7, if I go up to y=7, at τ=7 I am on y=7? No.\n\nAt turn τ=7, I am on y_7.\n\nIf at τ=6, I was on y=6, and I chose action S, then at τ=7, I am still on y=6.\n\nThen at τ=7, I choose action U, so at τ=8, I will be on y=7.\n\nBut at turn τ=7, I am on y=6, safe.\n\nAt turn τ=8, I am on y=7.\n\nNow, at τ=8, row 7 is unsafe! Because row 7 unsafe at τ=8.\n\nSo if I am on y=7 at τ=8, I collide.\n\nIf I go to y=7 at τ=8, I am on it at τ=8, unsafe.\n\nSo I cannot be on row 7 at τ=8 either.\n\nThe only way is to be on row 7 after τ=8, i.e., at τ=9 or later.\n\nSimilarly, I could delay going to row 7.\n\nBut I need to go to row 8 and 9.\n\nFirst, let's list the safe times for each row.\n\nFor row 1: safe except τ=12,13,14\n\nSimilarly row 2: same\n\nRow 3: safe except τ=0,1,2 → safe for τ≥3\n\nRow 4: same, safe τ≥3\n\nRow 5: same, safe τ≥3\n\nRow 6: safe except τ=2 → safe for τ≠2\n\nRow 7: safe except τ=6,7,8 → safe for τ≤5 or τ≥9\n\nRow 8: safe except τ=12,13,14 → safe for τ≤11 or τ≥15, but since we want minimal time, τ≤11 likely.\n\nRow 9: always safe.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=0 at τ=0 to y=9 at some τ=H-1.\n\ny=0 at τ=0.\n\nI can go to y=1 at τ=1 by going up.\n\nAt τ=0, y=0, action U, to y=1 at τ=1.\n\nAt τ=1, on y=1, safe.\n\nAction U to y=2 at τ=2.\n\nAt τ=2, on y=2, safe (since row 2 unsafe only at τ=12-14).\n\nThen at τ=2, I need to go to y=3, but row 3 is unsafe at τ=2, so I cannot be on row 3 at τ=2.\n\nTherefore, at τ=2, I should not go to y=3.\n\nI could stay on y=2 or go down, but going down might not help.\n\nAt τ=2, on y=2, I can choose S, stay, so at τ=3, still on y=2.\n\nThen at τ=3, I can go to y=3, since row 3 safe at τ=3.\n\nSimilarly, for row 4 and 5, they are safe at τ=3 and after.\n\nBut row 6 has a problem at τ=2.\n\nIn this case, at τ=3, I can go to y=3, then to y=4 at τ=4, to y=5 at τ=5.\n\nNow at τ=5, on y=5, safe.\n\nThen go to y=6 at τ=6.\n\nAt τ=6, on y=6, safe.\n\nNow, I need to go to y=7, but row 7 unsafe at τ=6,7,8.\n\nSo I cannot go to y=7 until τ=9 or later.\n\nAt τ=6, I am on y=6.\n\nI can stay on y=6 for some turns.\n\ny=6 is safe except at τ=2, which is past.\n\nSo safe to stay on y=6.\n\nFor example, I can stay on y=6 from τ=6 to τ=8.\n\nAt τ=6: on y=6, action S\n\nAt τ=7: on y=6, action S\n\nAt τ=8: on y=6, action U to y=7 at τ=9.\n\nAt τ=9, I am on y=7.\n\nNow, at τ=9, row 7 is safe? Row 7 unsafe only at τ=6,7,8, so at τ=9, safe.\n\nYes.\n\nThen at τ=9, on y=7, I can go to y=8 at τ=10.\n\nAt τ=10, on y=8.\n\nRow 8 unsafe at τ=12,13,14, not at τ=10, so safe.\n\nThen go to y=9 at τ=11.\n\nAt τ=11, on y=9, which is safe.\n\nBut I need to reach y=9 at τ=11.\n\nIn this sequence, at τ=11, I am at y=9.\n\nNow, check the actions.\n\nFirst, from τ=0 to τ=2: I need to handle the early part.\n\nAt τ=0: start y=0, action U, to y=1 at τ=1\n\nAt τ=1: on y=1, action U, to y=2 at τ=2\n\nAt τ=2: on y=2, but row 3 unsafe at τ=2, so I cannot go to y=3. Instead, I can stay on y=2 or go down.\n\nBut if I go down to y=1, that might not help.\n\nSince row 2 is safe at τ=2, I can stay.\n\nSo at τ=2: on y=2, action S, to y=2 at τ=3? Action S means stay, so y_{τ+1} = y_τ.\n\nAt τ=2, action S, then at τ=3, still on y=2.\n\nThen at τ=3: on y=2, now I can go to y=3, action U, to y=3 at τ=4.\n\nAt τ=4: on y=3, action U to y=4 at τ=5\n\nAt τ=5: on y=4? Let's list:\n\nτ=0: y=0, action U → to y=1 at τ=1\n\nτ=1: y=1, action U → to y=2 at τ=2\n\nτ=2: y=2, action S → to y=2 at τ=3 (since stay)\n\nAt τ=3: y=2, action U → to y=3 at τ=4\n\nAt τ=4: y=3, action U → to y=4 at τ=5\n\nAt τ=5: y=4, action U → to y=5 at τ=6\n\nAt τ=6: y=5, action U → to y=6 at τ=7? No\n\nAt τ=5: on y=4, after action U, to y=5 at τ=6.\n\nSet the position at each turn.\n\nAt turn τ, y_τ, then action a_τ, then y_{τ+1} = y_τ + Δy\n\nAt τ=0: y_0 = 0, choose a_0\n\nAfter a_0, y_1 = y_0 + Δy\n\nSimilarly.\n\nIn terms of when I am on the row.\n\nAt τ=0: on y=0, safe.\n\nChoose a_0 = U, so y_1 = 1\n\nAt τ=1: on y=1, safe (row 1 safe at τ=1)\n\nChoose a_1 = U, so y_2 = 2\n\nAt τ=2: on y=2, safe.\n\nNow, I need to choose a_2. If I choose U, y_3 = 3, but at τ=2, if I go to y=3 at τ=3, but at turn τ=2, I am on y=2, not on row 3. The collision at τ=2 is only if I am on row 3 at τ=2.\n\nAt τ=2, I am on y=2, so not on row 3, so no collision.\n\nBut if I choose a_2 = U, then y_3 = 3, so at τ=3, I will be on y=3.\n\nAt τ=3, on y=3, row 3: at τ=3, it is safe, as we said earlier.\n\nIn my previous, I thought row 3 unsafe at τ=2, but at τ=3 safe.\n\nIn the sequence above, if at τ=2 I go up to y=3 at τ=3, then at τ=3 I am on y=3, which is safe since τ=3>2.\n\nSimilarly, I can go directly to y=3 at τ=3.\n\nBut earlier I had a problem with row 7.\n\nLet's try the direct path again with this.\n\nAt τ=0: y=0, a=U, y=1 at τ=1\n\nτ=1: y=1, a=U, y=2 at τ=2\n\nτ=2: y=2, a=U, y=3 at τ=3\n\nAt τ=3: y=3, row 3 safe at τ=3, so ok.\n\na=U, y=4 at τ=4\n\nτ=4: y=4, a=U, y=5 at τ=5\n\nτ=5: y=5, a=U, y=6 at τ=6\n\nτ=6: y=6, row 6 safe at τ=6.\n\nNow a=U? If a=U, y=7 at τ=7\n\nBut at τ=7, on y=7, row 7 unsafe at τ=7, collision.\n\nSo cannot.\n\na=S? If a=S, y=6 at τ=7\n\nAt τ=7: y=6, row 6 safe.\n\nThen a=U? to y=7 at τ=8\n\nAt τ=8: y=7, row 7 unsafe at τ=8, collision.\n\nIf at τ=7, I stay again, a=S, y=6 at τ=8\n\nAt τ=8: y=6, safe.\n\nThen a=U to y=7 at τ=9\n\nAt τ=9: y=7, row 7 safe at τ=9.\n\nThen I can proceed.\n\nNow, from here, at τ=9: y=7, a=U to y=8 at τ=10\n\nAt τ=10: y=8, row 8 safe at τ=10? Row 8 unsafe at τ=12-14, so at τ=10 safe.\n\na=U to y=9 at τ=11\n\nAt τ=11: y=9, safe, and I reached y=9.\n\nBut at τ=11, y=9, which is the position.\n\nNow, how many turns? From τ=0 to τ=11, that's 12 turns? Let's see the indices.\n\nτ starts from 0.\n\nAt τ=0, position y=0.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn τ=H, y_H.\n\nWe need y_{t_1 + H -1} =9? Let's see the time.\n\nIn the problem, current turn t_1, position at t_1 is given.\n\nThen actions a_{t_1}, a_{t_1+1}, ..., up to a_{t_1 + H -1}, and after that, at turn t_1 + H, position is (0,9).\n\nThe sequence of actions from t= t_1 to t= t_1 + H -1.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t_1 + H, we are at (0,9).\n\nAt turn t, position is before action or after?\n\nFrom the dynamics: at turn t, position y_t, then choose action a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nAnd collision at turn t if on row y_t, and 0 in car span on that row at turn t.\n\nThen we reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H.\n\nIn terms of τ, set τ=0 at t_1.\n\nAt τ=0, position y=0.\n\nAfter actions a_0 to a_{H-1}, at τ=H, position y=9.\n\nNow, in the sequence, we need to output actions from a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H-1}.\n\nIn the above, with delays.\n\nIn the path I had:\n\n- At τ=0: y=0, action U → to y=1 at τ=1\n\n- τ=1: y=1, action U → to y=2 at τ=2\n\n- τ=2: y=2, action U → to y=3 at τ=3? But earlier I thought about row 3 at τ=2.\n\nAt τ=2, I am on y=2, action U, so at τ=3, y=3.\n\nBut at τ=2, I am not on row 3, so no issue. At τ=3, y=3, which is safe.\n\nIn this case, I don't need to stay at τ=2.\n\nLet's confirm:\n\nDirect to y=3 at τ=3:\n\nτ=0: y=0, a=U → y=1 at τ=1\n\nτ=1: y=1, a=U → y=2 at τ=2\n\nτ=2: y=2, a=U → y=3 at τ=3\n\nAt τ=3: y=3, row 3 safe (τ=3>2)\n\na=U → y=4 at τ=4\n\nτ=4: y=4, a=U → y=5 at τ=5\n\nτ=5: y=5, a=U → y=6 at τ=6\n\nτ=6: y=6, row 6 safe\n\nNow, instead of going up, I need to stay or something because row 7 is unsafe at τ=6,7,8.\n\nSo at τ=6: y=6, I choose action S → y=6 at τ=7\n\nτ=7: y=6, action S → y=6 at τ=8\n\nτ=8: y=6, action U → y=7 at τ=9\n\nτ=9: y=7, row 7 safe now (τ=9>8)\n\na=U → y=8 at τ=10\n\nτ=10: y=8, a=U → y=9 at τ=11\n\nAt τ=11, y=9, reached.\n\nNow, H=11, since from τ=0 to τ=11, that's 11 steps? τ=0 to τ=11 is 12 turns, but positions from τ=0 to τ=11.\n\nAt τ=0: y=0\n\nAfter first action, at τ=1: y=1\n\n...\n\nAfter action at τ=10, at τ=11: y=9\n\nWe have actions from a_0 to a_{10}, that's 11 actions, and after that, at τ=11, y=9.\n\nSo H=11.\n\nBut earlier I thought minimal is 9, but with delay, 11.\n\nCan I do better?\n\nFor example, at row 6, I stayed two extra turns.\n\nBut row 7 is unsafe from τ=6 to τ=8, so I must avoid being on row 7 during those times.\n\nThe earliest I can be on row 7 is τ=9.\n\nNow, I reached row 6 at τ=6, which is early, but I have to wait until τ=9 to go to row 7.\n\nPerhaps I can reach row 6 later, but since I started from below, I can only reach row 6 at τ=6 or later if I delay earlier.\n\nIn the beginning, I went directly to row 6 at τ=6.\n\nIf I delay going up, I might reach row 6 later, but that might take more time.\n\nFor example, if I stay at y=0 or something, but that would take longer.\n\nMinimal is to go up as fast as possible until I have to wait.\n\nIn this case, I had to wait at y=6 for two turns.\n\nBut is there a way to avoid that?\n\nPerhaps I can go to row 7 before τ=6.\n\nBut at τ=0, I start at y=0, to reach y=7, I need at least 7 steps: at τ=7, y=7.\n\nBut at τ=7, row 7 is unsafe, so I cannot be on y=7 at τ=7.\n\nSimilarly, at τ=6, y=6, but to be on y=7 at τ=6, I need to have been at y=6 at τ=5, and go up.\n\nAt τ=5, I can be at y=5, go up to y=6 at τ=6.\n\nThen at τ=6, on y=6, if I go up to y=7 at τ=7, but at τ=7 on y=7 unsafe.\n\nIf I go directly to y=7 at τ=6? But to be on y=7 at τ=6, I need to have y=7 at turn τ=6.\n\nThat means at τ=5, I must be at y=6 or y=7? To have y=7 at τ=6, at τ=5 I must be at y=6 or y=7? If at τ=5 y=6, action U, then y=7 at τ=6.\n\nBut at τ=6, on y=7, row 7 unsafe at τ=6.\n\nSo still collision.\n\nIf I am at y=7 at τ=5, but at τ=5, how can I be at y=7? From below, at τ=4, I need to be at y=6 or y=7, and so on.\n\nEarliest to reach y=7 is at τ=7, but at τ=7 unsafe.\n\nNext is τ=8, unsafe.\n\nThen τ=9, safe.\n\nSo I must be on y=7 at τ=9 or later.\n\nSimilarly, in the sequence, I have to be at y=7 at τ=9.\n\nNow, from below, I need to be at y=6 at τ=8 to go to y=7 at τ=9.\n\nIn my sequence, I was at y=6 at τ=6,7,8, then to y=7 at τ=9.\n\nBut I could be at y=6 later.\n\nFor example, if I delay the earlier steps.\n\nBut since rows 3,4,5 are unsafe before τ=3, I cannot be on them before τ=3.\n\nAt τ=0, y=0\n\nI can go to y=1 at τ=1, y=2 at τ=2.\n\nAt τ=2, on y=2, I can stay or go to y=3 at τ=3.\n\nIf I stay at τ=2, y=2, then at τ=3 go to y=3, etc., same as before.\n\nI could go slower, but that would take more time.\n\nFor example, at τ=2, if I stay, I reach y=3 at τ=4? No.\n\nIn the direct: to y=2 at τ=2, then to y=3 at τ=3.\n\nIf I stay at τ=2, to y=2 at τ=3, then to y=3 at τ=4, one step later.\n\nThen similarly, reach y=6 at τ=7 instead of τ=6.\n\nThen at τ=7, on y=6, I can go to y=7 at τ=8, but at τ=8 on y=7 unsafe.\n\nOr stay, then go at τ=9 to y=7.\n\nBut then I reach y=7 at τ=9, same as before, but I started later.\n\nSequence:\n\nτ=0: y=0, a=U → y=1 τ=1\n\nτ=1: y=1, a=U → y=2 τ=2\n\nτ=2: y=2, a=S → y=2 τ=3  (stay)\n\nτ=3: y=2, a=U → y=3 τ=4\n\nτ=4: y=3, a=U → y=4 τ=5\n\nτ=5: y=4, a=U → y=5 τ=6\n\nτ=6: y=5, a=U → y=6 τ=7\n\nτ=7: y=6, a=S → y=6 τ=8  (since if go U, to y=7 at τ=8, unsafe)\n\nτ=8: y=6, a=U → y=7 τ=9\n\nτ=9: y=7, a=U → y=8 τ=10\n\nτ=10: y=8, a=U → y=9 τ=11\n\nSame as before, H=11.\n\nIf I don't stay at τ=2, but go directly, I reach y=6 at τ=6, then stay two times.\n\nIn the first sequence, I reached y=6 at τ=6, stayed at τ=6 and τ=7, then at τ=8 to y=6? No.\n\nIn first sequence:\n\nAfter reaching y=6 at τ=6:\n\nτ=6: y=6, a=S → y=6 at τ=7\n\nτ=7: y=6, a=S → y=6 at τ=8\n\nτ=8: y=6, a=U → y=7 at τ=9\n\n...\n\nSo I stayed two extra turns at y=6.\n\nBut in the delayed start, I also took 11 turns.\n\nNow, can I reach in 10 turns?\n\nSuppose I want to be at y=9 at τ=10.\n\nThen I need to be at y=8 at τ=9, y=7 at τ=8, etc.\n\nBut at τ=8, if I am on y=7, row 7 unsafe at τ=8.\n\nCannot.\n\nAt τ=7, on y=7, unsafe.\n\nAt τ=6, on y=7, but to be on y=7 at τ=6, I need to have been at y=6 at τ=5, and go up, so at τ=6 on y=7, unsafe.\n\nSo impossible to be on y=7 at τ=6,7, or 8.\n\nTherefore, the earliest I can be on y=7 is τ=9.\n\nThen at τ=9, y=7, go to y=8 at τ=10, y=9 at τ=11.\n\nSo I must be at y=9 at τ=11 at earliest.\n\nThus minimal H=11.\n\nNow, in the sequence, I need to output the actions.\n\nBut in the beginning, I have row 6 unsafe at τ=2, but in the path, when am I on row 6?\n\nIn the sequence, I reach y=6 at τ=6 or later, which is after τ=2, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nBut in the output, I need to specify the actions.\n\nAlso, for the early rows, I can go directly.\n\nIn the sequence, at τ=2, I can go up to y=3 at τ=3, no need to stay.\n\nSo let's write the action sequence for τ from 0 to 10 (11 actions).\n\nτ=0: a=U  (from y=0 to y=1)\n\nτ=1: a=U  (y=1 to y=2)\n\nτ=2: a=U  (y=2 to y=3) // at τ=3, y=3 safe\n\nτ=3: a=U  (y=3 to y=4)\n\nτ=4: a=U  (y=4 to y=5)\n\nτ=5: a=U  (y=5 to y=6)\n\nτ=6: a=S  (stay y=6) // because cannot go up yet\n\nτ=7: a=S  (stay y=6)\n\nτ=8: a=U  (y=6 to y=7)\n\nτ=9: a=U  (y=7 to y=8)\n\nτ=10: a=U  (y=8 to y=9)\n\nAfter τ=10 action, at τ=11, y=9.\n\nActions from τ=0 to τ=10.\n\nNumber of actions: 11.\n\nIn terms of turn: t_1 =6, so actions at t=6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16? Let's list.\n\nτ=0: t=6\n\nτ=1: t=7\n\n...\n\nτ=10: t=16\n\nSo actions from t=6 to t=16, that's 11 actions.\n\nAfter last action at t=16, position at t=17 is (0,9).\n\nBut the turn when we reach is t=17.\n\nIn the answer, we need to output the actions.\n\nBut in the sequence above, at τ=2, I did a=U to go to y=3 at τ=3.\n\nBut at τ=2, when I am on y=2, and I do a=U, is there any issue? No, because I am not on row 3 at τ=2.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nNow, but I have row 6 at τ=6,7,8, all safe.\n\nRow 7 at τ=9, safe.\n\nBut is there any other constraint?\n\nWhat about row 8? I go to y=8 at τ=10, which is fine, since unsafe only at τ=12-14.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut in the car state, for row 6, we have a car, but at τ=6,7,8, it is far left, no issue.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nBut in the beginning, for rows 3,4,5, I went through at τ=3,4,5, which are safe.\n\nAt τ=3, y=3, row 3: at τ=3, car span: for row 3, second car [-11+4*3, 4*3] = [-11+12,12] = [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, the only issue was row 7.\n\nSo I think this works.\n\nBut can I save a turn?\n\nSuppose I go to y=7 at τ=9, y=8 at τ=10, y=9 at τ=11.\n\nMust be.\n\nBut from below, I need to be at y=6 at τ=8 to go to y=7 at τ=9.\n\nIn my sequence, I was at y=6 from τ=6 to τ=8.\n\nBut I could reach y=6 at τ=8 directly.\n\nFor example, if I delay the ascent.\n\nStart at τ=0: y=0, a=S (stay) → y=0 at τ=1\n\nBut y=0 is safe, but I need to move.\n\nThen at τ=1: y=0, a=U → y=1 at τ=2\n\nτ=2: y=1, a=U → y=2 at τ=3\n\nτ=3: y=2, a=U → y=3 at τ=4\n\nτ=4: y=3, a=U → y=4 at τ=5\n\nτ=5: y=4, a=U → y=5 at τ=6\n\nτ=6: y=5, a=U → y=6 at τ=7\n\nτ=7: y=6, a=S? → y=6 at τ=8  (since if go U, to y=7 at τ=8 unsafe)\n\nτ=8: y=6, a=U → y=7 at τ=9\n\nThen same as before, but I reached y=6 later, and still go to y=7 at τ=9.\n\nBut now at τ=11 y=9, same H=11.\n\nAnd I wasted time at start.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo the first sequence is better: go up as fast as possible until y=6, then wait two turns, then go up.\n\nNow, in the action sequence, I have a=S at τ=6 and τ=7.\n\nBut τ=6 and τ=7 correspond to t=12 and t=13? t_1=6.\n\nτ=0: t=6\n\nτ=1: t=7\n\nτ=2: t=8\n\nτ=3: t=9\n\nτ=4: t=10\n\nτ=5: t=11\n\nτ=6: t=12\n\nτ=7: t=13\n\nτ=8: t=14\n\nτ=9: t=15\n\nτ=10: t=16\n\nNow, at τ=6 (t=12), I do a=S, stay at y=6.\n\nBut row 6 at t=12: is it safe?\n\nRow 6 unsafe only at τ=2, which is t=8, past.\n\nBut let's confirm the cars.\n\nAt τ=6, t=12, row 6: car left-moving, span [48-36*6, 83-36*6] = [48-216, 83-216] = [-168,-133], not near 0, safe.\n\nSimilarly, at τ=7, t=13, same.\n\nNow, when I go to row 7 at τ=9 (t=15), row 7 at t=15: τ=9, span for the third car: [-35+4*9, -24+4*9] = [-35+36, -24+36] = [1,12], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly, row 8 at τ=10 (t=16), no issue.\n\nNow, but in the output, I need to list the actions for each turn.\n\nAlso, the initial position is given at t=6, (0,0).\n\nNow, the sequence of actions:\n\nTurn t=6: a_{t1} = a_6, which is τ=0, action U\n\nIn the sequence, for turn t, action a_t.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 6: a_6 = U  (from y=0 to y=1)\n\nAfter a_6, at t=7, y=1\n\nTurn 7: a_7 = U  (to y=2 at t=8)\n\nAt t=7, position y=1, action U, so at t=8, y=2\n\nTurn 8: a_8 = U  (to y=3 at t=9)\n\nAt t=8, position y=2, action U, to y=3 at t=9\n\nTurn 9: a_9 = U  (to y=4 at t=10)\n\nAt t=9, y=3, action U, to y=4 at t=10\n\nTurn 10: a_10 = U  (to y=5 at t=11)\n\nAt t=10, y=4, action U, to y=5 at t=11\n\nTurn 11: a_11 = U  (to y=6 at t=12)\n\nAt t=11, y=5, action U, to y=6 at t=12\n\nNow at t=12, position y=6\n\nTurn 12: a_12 = S  (stay, so y=6 at t=13)\n\nAt t=12, y=6, action S, so y=6 at t=13\n\nTurn 13: a_13 = S  (stay, y=6 at t=14)\n\nAt t=13, y=6, action S, to y=6 at t=14\n\nTurn 14: a_14 = U  (to y=7 at t=15)\n\nAt t=14, y=6, action U, to y=7 at t=15\n\nTurn 15: a_15 = U  (to y=8 at t=16)\n\nAt t=15, y=7, action U, to y=8 at t=16\n\nTurn 16: a_16 = U  (to y=9 at t=17)\n\nAt t=16, y=8, action U, to y=9 at t=17\n\nNow at t=17, y=9, reached.\n\nActions from t=6 to t=16, that's 11 actions.\n\nThe last action is at t=16, and position at t=17 is (0,9).\n\nIn the answer, it should be the sequence of actions.\n\nBut in the output format, it says \\{a_{t_1 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{H-1}, so for t from 0 to H-1.\n\nt_1 + t, with t=0 to H-1.\n\nSo a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H-1}\n\nIn this case, t_1=6, actions from a_6 to a_{6+H-1}, and after that at turn t_1 + H, position is (0,9).\n\nHere, after a_16 at t=16, position at t=17=6+11? t_1 + H =6 + H.\n\nAt turn t_1 + H =17, position y=9.\n\nSo H=11.\n\nActions: a_6 to a_{16}, which is a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + 10}, since 16-6=10, so t from 0 to 10, 11 actions.\n\nNow, list:\n\nTurn 6: a_6 = U\n\nTurn 7: a_7 = U\n\nTurn 8: a_8 = U\n\nTurn 9: a_9 = U\n\nTurn 10: a_10 = U\n\nTurn 11: a_11 = U\n\nTurn 12: a_12 = S\n\nTurn 13: a_13 = S\n\nTurn 14: a_14 = U\n\nTurn 15: a_15 = U\n\nTurn 16: a_16 = U\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 11: a_11 = U, which is to go from y=5 to y=6 at t=12.\n\nThen turn 12: a_12=S, stay at y=6.\n\nNow, is there any collision during this?\n\nFor example, at turn t=8: position y=2, which is row 2.\n\nRow 2 at t=8: t=8 corresponds to τ=2, since τ=0 at t=6, t=8 is τ=2.\n\nRow 2: unsafe at τ=12,13,14, not at τ=2, so safe.\n\nAt turn t=9: position y=3, row 3 at t=9: τ=3, safe as above.\n\nSimilarly, all seem fine.\n\nBut at turn t=12: position y=6, row 6 at t=12: τ=6, safe.\n\nAction S, so stay.\n\nThen turn t=13: position y=6, same, action S.\n\nTurn t=14: position y=6, action U to y=7 at t=15.\n\nAt t=15: position y=7, row 7 at t=15: τ=9, safe.\n\nThen up to y=9.\n\nNow, but in the car state, for row 7, at τ=9, we have the car span [1,12], not at 0.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut I think I missed something: in the beginning, for row 3,4,5, at τ=0,1,2, they are unsafe, but I was not on them at those times.\n\nFor example, at τ=0, I was on y=0.\n\nAt τ=1, on y=1, not row 3,4,5.\n\nAt τ=2, on y=2, not row 3,4,5.\n\nSo all good.\n\nNow, but the answer should be the sequence.\n\nIn the output, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc.\n\nSo for t_1=6.\n\nNow, but let's confirm the number.\n\nH=11.\n\nActions: U,U,U,U,U,U,S,S,U,U,U\n\nFor turns 6 to 16.\n\nNow, but in the sequence, I have six U then two S then three U.\n\nBut to write in the box.\n\nBut I think this is minimal.\n\nPerhaps I can go down to avoid, but not necessary.\n\nAnother thing: row 6 at τ=2 is unsafe, but I am not on it at τ=2.\n\nτ=2 is t=8, I am on y=2 at that time.\n\nSo no.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nSo the minimal H is 11.\n\nNow, to output.\n</think>\nTo reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 0) at turn \\(t_1 = 6\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 11.

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at (0, 0) at turn t=12, and I need to get to (0, 9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The cars move left or right based on their direction and speed.\n\nThe collision rule is important: collision occurs at turn T only if the player is on a freeway y_T and at that turn, for any car on that freeway, the position x=0 is within the car's span at that exact turn. Also, when the player moves to a new y, they are not on that new y until the next turn, so they don't collide with cars on the new y at the current turn.\n\nThe player's y position changes based on actions: U for up (+1), D for down (-1), S for stay (0). y must stay between 0 and 9 inclusive.\n\nCurrent turn is t1=12, player at (0,0). I need to go to y=9.\n\ny=0 is the starting point, but there are no cars on y=0 or y=9 since freeways are y=1 to 8. y=9 is the target, so no cars there either. But to reach y=9, I need to pass through y=1 to 8, where cars are present.\n\nNow, let's look at the car states for each freeway at turn t=12.\n\nFor each freeway k (which is the y-level), there are cars listed with (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nDirection: right means moving right, so head is the front, I assume. For right-moving cars, head is the leading part, so if direction is right, and head and tail are given, for example, head=48, tail=37, but tail should be less than head if it's moving right? Let's see the update rule.\n\nFrom the car update:\n\nLeft-moving: Span(t) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t), τ - s(T-t)]\n\nRight-moving: Span(t) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t), h + s(T-t)]\n\nFor right-moving, it says Span(t1) = [τ, h], so τ is the tail, h is the head, and since it's moving right, τ should be left of h, so τ < h.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, Span(t1) = [h, τ], but if it's moving left, head should be on the left, so h > τ? The notation might be inconsistent.\n\nLet's clarify the span definition.\n\nFor left-moving car: \"Span(t1) = [h, τ]\" and then moves to [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT], so as time increases, both decrease, meaning the car is moving left. But in the span [h, τ], if it's moving left, h should be the leftmost point? But typically, for a car moving left, the head is on the left.\n\nIn the span [h, τ], if h and τ are positions, and it moves left, both decrease, so if h > τ, then [h, τ] might imply h is larger, but when moving left, the head should be smaller if x decreases left? I think I need to interpret the coordinates.\n\nAssume x-axis with left being negative, right positive, as per car positions given, like -48, etc.\n\nSo, for a left-moving car, it moves towards negative x.\n\nSpan at t1: [h, τ]. After time ΔT, it becomes [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT]. Since s > 0, h - sΔT < h, τ - sΔT < τ, so the whole car shifts left. Now, for the span to make sense, if the car is moving left, the head should be at the left end, so in [h, τ], h should be the left head, and τ the right tail, so h < τ? But in the example, for freeway 6, there's (48, 83, left, 36). 48 and 83, if left-moving, and [h, τ] = [48, 83], but 48 < 83, so if moving left, head at smaller x, so 48 should be head, 83 tail, but when moving left, head is left, tail is right, so [h, τ] with h=48, τ=83, h < τ, so span from 48 to 83, which is from left to right? But if moving left, the car should be oriented with head left.\n\nPerhaps the span is always from left to right, regardless of direction? But for collision, we care about the position at x=0 relative to the span.\n\nFor collision: if at turn T, the player is on freeway y, and for any car on that freeway, 0 is in the span at that turn, then collision.\n\n0 in span [a,b] means a <= 0 <= b, assuming a <= b.\n\nNow, for the car definitions:\n\nFor right-moving car, Span(t1) = [τ, h], and it says [τ, h] for right-moving, then Span(T) = [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT].\n\nSince it's moving right, τ + sΔT increases, h + sΔT increases, so τ should be the left end, h the right end, so for right-moving, τ < h, and span is [left, right] = [τ, h].\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, Span(t1) = [h, τ], and Span(T) = [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT]. If moving left, h should be the right end (head when moving left is right if we think of direction), but in the span, it's given as [h, τ], and after moving left, both decrease, so if h and τ are positions, for the car to move left, the right end should decrease, so h should be the right end, τ the left end? I'm confusing myself.\n\nLook at freeway 6: (48, 83, left, 36). Direction left, so moving left. Span(t1) = [h, τ] = [48, 83]. At t=12, span [48,83]. Since moving left, at time T, span [48 - 36(T-12), 83 - 36(T-12)].\n\nBut 48 < 83, so [48,83] is from x=48 to x=83, which is a car of length 35, with left at 48, right at 83. Moving left, so the left end moves left (more negative), right end moves left.\n\nSimilarly, for a right-moving car, e.g. on freeway 1: (-48, -59, right, 4). Span(t1) = [τ, h] = [-59, -48]? It says (head, tail) in the table, but in the car state, it's listed as (head, tail, dir, speed), but in the span definition, for right-moving, it's [τ, h], so τ is tail, h is head.\n\nIn the table, for freeway 1: \"(-48, -59, right, 4)\", so head = -48, tail = -59? But for right-moving, tail should be left of head, so if tail = -59, head = -48, that makes sense, since -59 < -48, so tail at -59, head at -48.\n\nThen Span(t1) for right-moving is [τ, h] = [-59, -48].\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, like freeway 6: (48, 83, left, 36), head=48, tail=83? But 48 < 83, so if moving left, head should be at higher x? Direction left, so moving to decreasing x, so head at x=48, tail at x=83, but 48 < 83, so left at 48, right at 83, moving left, so head at left? I think I have a inconsistency in terminology.\n\nTo avoid confusion, let's not use head and tail; instead, for each car, the span is defined, and we can find min and max x at any time.\n\nFor collision, we need to know if 0 is between the min and max x of the car's span at turn T for the freeway the player is on.\n\nAlso, the player is only at risk when on y=1 to 8.\n\nAt turn t=12, player at (0,0), so not on any freeway yet. When he moves to y=1 at some turn, he is on that freeway.\n\nThe action sequence starts from t=12, so at turn t=12, he is at y=0, and he chooses action for turn t=12, which determines y at t=13, and so on.\n\nLet's denote the turns: at the start of turn t, the player is at position (0, y_t), and chooses action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nThe sequence is from t=t1 to t1+H-1, so after H actions, at turn t1+H, y is set, and we want y_{t1+H} =9.\n\nt1=12, so after H turns, at turn 12+H, position is (0, y_{12+H}), and we want y_{12+H} =9.\n\ny_{t} for t from 12 to 12+H.\n\nAt t=12, y=0.\n\nAfter first action at t=12, y_{13} = y_12 + Δy, and so on, up to after H actions, y_{12+H}.\n\nWe want y_{12+H} =9.\n\nThe minimal H such that we can reach y=9 in H moves.\n\nSince we start at y=0 and go to y=9, minimum possible H is 9, if we go up every turn, but we might hit cars, so we need to avoid them by staying or moving down sometimes, or timing the moves.\n\nH is the number of turns, so from t=12 to t=12+H-1 we take actions, and at t=12+H we are at y.\n\nFor example, if H=1, action at t=12, y_{13} = something, but if y_{13} =9, that means from 0 to 9 in one move, but actions only change y by -1,0,1, so impossible to jump to 9. Minimum H is 9, with all U moves, but may not be possible due to cars.\n\nMaximum y is 9, min 0, so to go from 0 to 9, need at least 9 up moves, and possibly some S or D, but S or D increase time, so minimal H would be with all U, if possible.\n\nBut we may need to wait or move down to avoid cars.\n\nFirst, let's list all cars and their positions over time.\n\nt1=12 is current turn.\n\nFor any future turn T, for a car on freeway k, we can compute its span at turn T.\n\nThen for the player to be on freeway k at turn T, we need that at turn T, for that car, 0 not in span.\n\nAlso, the player moves vertically, so we need to choose a path from y=0 to y=9 through the freeways.\n\nSince the cars move horizontally, and we care about when x=0 is covered by a car on the freeway we are on.\n\nNow, for each freeway, we need to find times when it is safe to be on that freeway, i.e., no car has 0 in its span at that time.\n\nBut since there might be multiple cars per freeway, we need that for all cars on that freeway, at time T, 0 not in span.\n\nLet's list for each freeway the cars and their span functions.\n\nFreeway k=1: one car: (head, tail, dir, speed) = (-48, -59, right, 4)\n\nSince right-moving, span at time T: [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] with τ = tail = -59, h = head = -48? From earlier: for right-moving, Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] and Span(t1) = [τ, h]\n\nIn the car state, it's given as (head, tail), so for this, head = -48, tail = -59, and since right-moving, tail should be left, head right, so tail = -59, head = -48, so τ = tail = -59, h = head = -48.\n\nSpan at T: [ -59 + 4*(T-12) , -48 + 4*(T-12) ]\n\nSimilarly, for freeway k=2: same as k=1: (-48, -59, right, 4), so span at T: [ -59 + 4*(T-12) , -48 + 4*(T-12) ]\n\nFreeway k=3: two cars: (48, 37, right, 4) and (0, -11, right, 4)\n\nFirst car: head=48, tail=37? For right-moving, tail should be left of head, so tail=37, head=48? 37<48, so τ=37, h=48, span at T: [37 + 4*(T-12), 48 + 4*(T-12)]\n\nSecond car: (0, -11, right, 4), tail=-11, head=0, so τ=-11, h=0, span at T: [-11 + 4*(T-12), 0 + 4*(T-12)] = [4(T-12) -11, 4(T-12)]\n\nFreeway k=4: same as k=3: (48,37,right,4) and (0,-11,right,4), so same spans as above.\n\nFreeway k=5: same as k=3 and 4: (48,37,right,4) and (0,-11,right,4)\n\nFreeway k=6: one car: (48,83,left,36)\n\nDirection left, so for left-moving, Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)] with Span(t1) = [h, τ]\n\nHere head=48, tail=83, and moving left, so h=48, τ=83, span at T: [48 - 36(T-12), 83 - 36(T-12)]\n\nSince 48 < 83, min x at T is 48 - 36(T-12), max x is 83 - 36(T-12)\n\nFreeway k=7: three cars: (48,37,right,4), (12,1,right,4), (-24,-35,right,4)\n\nFirst car: same as before, head=48, tail=37? τ=37, h=48, span [37 + 4(T-12), 48 + 4(T-12)]\n\nSecond car: (12,1,right,4), head=12, tail=1, so τ=1, h=12, span [1 + 4(T-12), 12 + 4(T-12)]\n\nThird car: (-24,-35,right,4), head=-24, tail=-35, τ=-35, h=-24, span [-35 + 4(T-12), -24 + 4(T-12)]\n\nFreeway k=8: (-48,-59,right,4), same as k=1 and 2, span [-59 + 4(T-12), -48 + 4(T-12)]\n\nNow, for each freeway, we need to find for which times T, 0 is not in the span of any car on that freeway. That is, for each car, 0 not in [min, max] of its span at T.\n\nSince there might be multiple cars, we need 0 not in any of the spans for that freeway at T.\n\nFor a given freeway k and time T, if there exists a car on k such that min <= 0 <= max, then unsafe at T.\n\nOtherwise safe.\n\nThe player needs to be on freeway y at turn T only when it is safe for that y and T.\n\nBut the player moves between freeways, so we need to sequence the vertical moves.\n\nSince we start at y=0 and end at y=9, and can only change y by -1,0,1 each turn, we must pass through each y from 0 to 9 in order, but we can stay or go down, so we might not visit all, but since we start at 0 and end at 9, we must go through y=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 at some points, but not necessarily at the same time; we can be on different y at different times.\n\nThe key is that for each freeway y=1 to 8, when the player is on that y at some turn T, it must be safe at that T for that y.\n\nAnd the player needs to go from y=0 to y=9 with minimal turns.\n\nTo minimize H, we want to go up as fast as possible, but avoid unsafe times.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway, the times when it is safe to be on it.\n\nSince t1=12, let u = T - 12, the number of turns after t1.\n\nSo u >=0, T = 12 + u.\n\nNow for each freeway, find for which u, it is safe.\n\nStart with freeway 1.\n\nFreeway 1: one car, span at T: [ -59 + 4u, -48 + 4u ] where u = T-12\n\n0 in span if -59 +4u <= 0 <= -48 +4u\n\nWhich means 4u <= 59 and 0 <= -48 +4u? Let's solve inequalities.\n\n-59 +4u <= 0 <= -48 +4u\n\nLeft: -59 +4u <= 0 => 4u <= 59 => u <= 59/4 = 14.75, so u <= 14 since u integer\n\nRight: 0 <= -48 +4u => 48 <= 4u => u >= 12\n\nAlso, since the span is [min,max], 0 in span if min <= 0 <= max, so both conditions.\n\nSo -59+4u <= 0 and 0 <= -48+4u\n\nFirst: -59+4u <= 0 => 4u <=59 => u <= 14.75, so u <=14\n\nSecond: 0 <= -48+4u => 4u >=48 => u >=12\n\nSo for u=12,13,14, 0 in span.\n\nWhen u=12, min = -59+48= -11, max= -48+48=0? u=12, min= -59+4*12= -59+48= -11, max= -48+48=0, so [ -11, 0], so 0 is included, since 0<=0.\n\nSimilarly u=13: min= -59+52= -7, max= -48+52=4, [ -7,4], 0 inside.\n\nu=14: min= -59+56= -3, max= -48+56=8, [ -3,8], 0 inside.\n\nu=15: min= -59+60=1, max= -48+60=12, [1,12], 0 not <=1? 0 < min=1, so 0 not in span.\n\nSimilarly u=11: min= -59+44= -15, max= -48+44= -4, [ -15,-4], 0 not in, since max=-4<0.\n\nSo for freeway 1, unsafe when u=12,13,14, i.e., T=24,25,26.\n\nSafe for u<12 or u>14, T<24 or T>26.\n\nT=12+u, so for T <=23 or T>=27, safe. T=12+u, u=0 at T=12.\n\nAt T=12, u=0, min= -59+0= -59, max= -48, [ -59,-48], 0 not in.\n\nSafe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2 same as freeway 1, since same car, so same safe/unsafe times.\n\nNow freeway 3: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (48,37,right,4) but head=48, tail=37, τ=37, h=48, span [37 +4u, 48+4u]\n\n0 in span if 37+4u <=0 <=48+4u\n\nBut 37+4u <=0? 4u <= -37, u <= -9.25, impossible since u>=0. Similarly, 0 <=48+4u always true for u>=0, but min=37+4u >=37>0, so min>0, so 0 not in span for this car at any u.\n\nSecond car: (0,-11,right,4), τ=-11, h=0, span [-11 +4u, 0 +4u] = [4u-11, 4u]\n\n0 in span if 4u-11 <=0 <=4u\n\nLeft: 4u-11 <=0 => 4u <=11 => u <= 2.75, so u<=2\n\nRight: 0 <=4u => u>=0\n\nSo for u=0,1,2.\n\nu=0: min= -11, max=0, [ -11,0], 0 included.\n\nu=1: min= -11+4= -7, max=4, [ -7,4], 0 in.\n\nu=2: min= -11+8= -3, max=8, [ -3,8], 0 in.\n\nu=3: min= -11+12=1, max=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo for second car, unsafe for u=0,1,2.\n\nFirst car always safe.\n\nTherefore for freeway 3, unsafe when second car has 0 in span, i.e., u=0,1,2, T=12,13,14.\n\nSafe for u>=3, T>=15.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 4 same as 3, unsafe T=12,13,14, safe T>=15.\n\nFreeway 5 same as 3 and 4, unsafe T=12,13,14, safe T>=15.\n\nNow freeway 6: one car (48,83,left,36)\n\nSpan at T: [h - s u, τ - s u] with h=48, τ=83, s=36\n\nSo [48 - 36u, 83 - 36u]\n\n0 in span if 48-36u <=0 <=83-36u\n\nLeft: 48-36u <=0 => 36u >=48 => u >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈1.333, so u>=2 since u integer\n\nRight: 0 <=83-36u => 36u <=83 => u <= 83/36 ≈2.305, so u<=2\n\nNow u>=2 and u<=2, so only u=2.\n\nu=2: min=48-72= -24, max=83-72=11, [ -24,11], 0 inside.\n\nu=1: min=48-36=12, max=83-36=47, [12,47], min>0, 0 not in.\n\nu=3: min=48-108= -60, max=83-108= -25, both negative, max<0, 0 not in.\n\nSo unsafe only at u=2, T=14.\n\nSafe for u≠2, T≠14.\n\nNow freeway 7: three cars.\n\nFirst car: (48,37,right,4), same as before, span [37+4u, 48+4u], min=37+4u >=37>0, so always safe, 0 never in span.\n\nSecond car: (12,1,right,4), head=12, tail=1, τ=1, h=12, span [1+4u, 12+4u]\n\n0 in span if 1+4u <=0 <=12+4u\n\nBut 1+4u <=0? 4u <= -1, impossible. min=1+4u >=1>0, so always safe.\n\nThird car: (-24,-35,right,4), head=-24, tail=-35, τ=-35, h=-24, span [-35 +4u, -24 +4u]\n\n0 in span if -35+4u <=0 <= -24+4u\n\nLeft: -35+4u <=0 => 4u <=35 => u <= 35/4=8.75, u<=8\n\nRight: 0 <= -24+4u => 4u >=24 => u>=6\n\nSo for u=6,7,8.\n\nu=6: min= -35+24= -11, max= -24+24=0, [ -11,0], 0 included.\n\nu=7: min= -35+28= -7, max= -24+28=4, [ -7,4], 0 in.\n\nu=8: min= -35+32= -3, max= -24+32=8, [ -3,8], 0 in.\n\nu=5: min= -35+20= -15, max= -24+20= -4, both <0, 0 not in.\n\nu=9: min= -35+36=1, max= -24+36=12, both >0, 0 not in.\n\nSo third car unsafe for u=6,7,8.\n\nFirst and second cars always safe.\n\nTherefore freeway 7 unsafe when third car unsafe, i.e., u=6,7,8, T=18,19,20.\n\nSafe otherwise.\n\nFinally freeway 8: same as freeway 1 and 2, (-48,-59,right,4), span [-59+4u, -48+4u]\n\nUnsafe when u=12,13,14 as before, T=24,25,26.\n\nSafe for T<=23 or T>=27.\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway, the unsafe times (T):\n\nFreeway 1: unsafe T=24,25,26\n\nFreeway 2: same, unsafe T=24,25,26\n\nFreeway 3: unsafe T=12,13,14\n\nFreeway 4: same, unsafe T=12,13,14\n\nFreeway 5: same, unsafe T=12,13,14\n\nFreeway 6: unsafe only T=14\n\nFreeway 7: unsafe T=18,19,20\n\nFreeway 8: unsafe T=24,25,26\n\nAnd safe at other times.\n\nThe player starts at t=12, y=0.\n\nAt turn t, if player is on y=k for k=1 to 8, then it must be safe at that t for that k.\n\nSince y=0 and y=9 have no cars, always safe.\n\nWe need to go from y=0 to y=9.\n\nMinimal path: go up as fast as possible, but avoid being on unsafe freeway at unsafe time.\n\nSince we start at t=12, y=0.\n\nWe can take actions to change y.\n\nEach action: U, D, S.\n\nTo go to y=9, we need net +9 in y, so at least 9 U actions.\n\nEach S or D adds a turn without progress, so to minimize H, we want to minimize S and D, ideally all U.\n\nBut we may need to wait or move down to avoid collisions.\n\nNow, let's see the unsafe times.\n\nFirst, freeways 3,4,5 are unsafe at t=12,13,14. But t=12 is current turn, player is at y=0, not on freeway yet.\n\nAt turn t, after action, we move to y_{t+1}, and at turn t+1, we are at position (0, y_{t+1}).\n\nLet's clarify the timing.\n\nAt the beginning of turn t, player is at (0, y_t).\n\nThen chooses action a_t.\n\nThen y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with Δy based on a_t.\n\nThen at turn t+1, player is at (0, y_{t+1}), and so on.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if at that turn, player is on freeway y_T (so y_T between 1 and 8), and for some car on that freeway, 0 in span at T.\n\nFor turn T, the position is y_T, and we check cars on freeway y_T.\n\nIn this case, at turn t=12, player is at y=0, which is not a freeway, so no collision possible. Then after action a_{12}, y_{13} is set, and at turn t=13, player is at (0, y_{13}), and if y_{13} between 1 and 8, we check for collision at t=13 with cars on that freeway.\n\nSimilarly for future turns.\n\nSo for the sequence, we need that for each turn T from t=13 onwards, if y_T in {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}, then it must be safe for that freeway at time T.\n\nNow, we start at t=12, y_{12}=0.\n\nWe apply actions from t=12 to t=12+H-1, and after H actions, at turn t=12+H, y_{12+H} =9.\n\nH is the number of actions.\n\nAfter H actions, we have y_{12+H}.\n\nWe want y_{12+H} =9.\n\nSince y_{12}=0, the sum of Δy from t=12 to t=12+H-1 must be +9.\n\nEach U: +1, D: -1, S: 0.\n\nSo number of U minus number of D must be 9, and H = number of U + number of D + number of S.\n\nTo minimize H, we want to minimize number of S and D, so ideally all U, H=9.\n\nBut with cars, it may not be possible to go directly up without being on unsafe freeway at unsafe time.\n\nNow, let's see if we can go up from t=12 with all U.\n\nStart t=12, y=0.\n\nAction a_{12}: U, then y_{13} = 0 +1 =1\n\nAt turn t=13, y=1, which is freeway 1.\n\nFreeway 1 unsafe at t=13? t=13, from above, freeway 1 unsafe at T=24,25,26, not at 13. At t=13, u=T-12=1, for freeway 1, safe since u=1<12, as earlier.\n\nFreeway 1 unsafe only at T=24,25,26.\n\nSimilarly, at t=13, u=1, safe for freeway 1.\n\nThen a_{13}: U, y_{14}=2\n\nAt t=14, y=2, freeway 2.\n\nFreeway 2 same as 1, unsafe only at 24,25,26, so t=14 safe.\n\na_{14}: U, y_{15}=3\n\nAt t=15, y=3, freeway 3.\n\nFreeway 3 unsafe at T=12,13,14.\n\nt=15, u=3, T=15, since u=3>=3, safe, as earlier.\n\nSimilarly, a_{15}: U, y_{16}=4\n\nt=16, y=4, freeway 4.\n\nFreeway 4 unsafe at T=12,13,14, t=16>14, safe.\n\na_{16}: U, y_{17}=5\n\nt=17, y=5, freeway 5, same as 4, unsafe only at 12,13,14, so t=17 safe.\n\na_{17}: U, y_{18}=6\n\nt=18, y=6, freeway 6.\n\nFreeway 6 unsafe only at T=14.\n\nt=18 ≠14, safe.\n\na_{18}: U, y_{19}=7\n\nt=19, y=7, freeway 7.\n\nFreeway 7 unsafe at T=18,19,20.\n\nt=19, u=7, T=19, which is in 18,19,20, unsafe! Collision if on freeway 7 at t=19.\n\nProblem.\n\nAt t=19, if we are on y=7, it is unsafe.\n\nBut in this path, at t=19, y=7, which is unsafe.\n\nSo we cannot be on freeway 7 at t=19.\n\nSimilarly, if we continue: a_{19}: U, y_{20}=8\n\nt=20, y=8, freeway 8.\n\nFreeway 8 unsafe at T=24,25,26, t=20<24, safe.\n\na_{20}: U, y_{21}=9, done.\n\nBut we have collision at t=19.\n\nSo the all-up path has a problem at t=19 on y=7.\n\nWe need to avoid being on y=7 at t=19, or at t=18,20 if possible, but since unsafe times are t=18,19,20 for y=7.\n\nIn the sequence above, we are on y=7 at t=19.\n\nTo avoid, we need to not be on y=7 during t=18,19,20.\n\nWe could delay or advance the time we are on y=7.\n\nSince we start at t=12, y=0.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nThe conflict is at y=7 around t=19.\n\nFreeway 7 is unsafe from t=18 to 20.\n\nIn the direct path, we are at y=7 at t=19.\n\nWe can try to be on y=7 at a different time.\n\nFor example, if we go slower, or faster, but going faster: we are going up as fast as possible, all U, so we cannot go faster.\n\nGo slower: add some S or D to change the timing.\n\nFor instance, at some point before, we can stay or move down to waste time, so that when we reach y=7, it is after t=20.\n\nIn the current path, we reach y=7 at t=19.\n\nt=19 is unsafe for y=7.\n\nWe need to be on y=7 at t<18 or t>20.\n\nSimilarly, for other freeways, but let's see the constraints.\n\nFirst, freeways 3,4,5 are unsafe only at t=12,13,14, which are early, and in the path we are on them at t=15,16,17, which are safe.\n\nFreeway 6 unsafe only at t=14, and we are on it at t=18, safe.\n\nFreeway 8 unsafe late, at 24,25,26, and we reach it at t=20, which is safe.\n\nOnly problem is freeway 7 at t=19.\n\nSo we need to shift the time we are on y=7.\n\nSince we are moving up, we can add a delay earlier.\n\nFor example, at some point, instead of going up, we stay or move down to waste a turn.\n\nThen we reach higher y later.\n\nCurrently, with all U:\n\nt=12: y=0\n\na12: U, t=13 y=1\n\na13: U, t=14 y=2\n\na14: U, t=15 y=3\n\na15: U, t=16 y=4\n\na16: U, t=17 y=5\n\na17: U, t=18 y=6\n\na18: U, t=19 y=7 → unsafe\n\nInstead, if we can make y=7 later than t=20.\n\nFor example, if we add a stay action somewhere.\n\nSay, at some turn before t=17, we do S instead of U.\n\nBut we need to be careful not to be on unsafe freeways at wrong times.\n\nSince freeways 3,4,5 are safe after t=14, and we are on them after t=14 in the path.\n\nFreeway 6 safe except t=14, but we are on it at t=18>14.\n\nNow, if we add a delay, say, at t=12, instead of U, we do S.\n\nThen:\n\nt=12: y=0, action a12: S, then y13=0 (stay)\n\nAt t=13, y=0, not freeway, safe.\n\na13: U, y14=1\n\nt=14, y=1, freeway 1, safe (since t=14<24)\n\na14: U, y15=2\n\nt=15, y=2, freeway 2, safe\n\na15: U, y16=3\n\nt=16, y=3, freeway 3, safe (t=16>14)\n\na16: U, y17=4\n\nt=17, y=4, freeway 4, safe\n\na17: U, y18=5\n\nt=18, y=5, freeway 5, safe\n\na18: U, y19=6\n\nt=19, y=6, freeway 6, safe? t=19, u=7, freeway 6 unsafe only at t=14, so safe.\n\na19: U, y20=7\n\nt=20, y=7, freeway 7, but t=20, unsafe! T=20 is in 18,19,20 for freeway 7.\n\nStill unsafe.\n\na20: U, y21=8\n\nt=21, y=8, freeway 8, safe (t=21<24)\n\na21: U, y22=9\n\nBut now we have collision at t=20.\n\nAnd H is larger, we used 10 actions to reach y=9 at t=22.\n\nOriginally with all U, we would reach y=9 at t=21, but with collision at t=19.\n\nNow with one S, we avoid collision but reach later.\n\nBut we still have issue at t=20.\n\nIn this sequence, at t=20, y=7, unsafe.\n\nTo avoid y=7 at t=18,19,20, we need to be on it before or after.\n\nt=17 or earlier, or t=21 or later.\n\nBut t=17: in the sequence, if we go faster, but we start from y=0, cannot go faster than all U.\n\nEarliest to reach y=7: from y=0, with all U, at t=19 y=7.\n\nt=12 y=0, t=13 y=1, ..., t=19 y=7.\n\nSo cannot be earlier than t=19.\n\nWe can be later, by adding delays.\n\nBut if we add delays, we reach later.\n\nNow, to be on y=7 at t=21 or later.\n\nSimilarly, for other y, but let's see.\n\nFreeway 7 unsafe at t=18,19,20.\n\nSo we need to be on y=7 at t<=17 or t>=21.\n\nBut t<=17: to be at y=7 at t=17, we need to have started earlier or moved faster, but we start at t=12 y=0, min time to y=7 is 7 up moves, so at t=19, as above.\n\nAt t=12, y=0.\n\nAfter 0 actions, y=0 at t=12.\n\nAfter 1 action, y at t=13, max y=1.\n\nAfter k actions, y at t=12+k, max y=k.\n\nTo have y=7 at t=17, t=17 is after 5 actions? t=12+k, set 12+k=17, k=5, y at t=17 is after 5 actions, max y=5, cannot be 7.\n\nMinimal t for y=7: after 7 actions, t=12+7=19, y=7 at t=19.\n\nSimilarly, at t=18, y<=6 after 6 actions; t=19 y<=7; etc.\n\nSo impossible to be at y=7 before t=19.\n\nThus, we cannot be on y=7 at t<=17; earliest is t=19.\n\nTherefore, we must be on y=7 at t>=21, since t=19 and 20 are unsafe.\n\nt=19 and 20 unsafe, so we need to be on y=7 at t>=21.\n\nSimilarly, we need to reach y=7 later.\n\nBut to reach y=7 at t=21, we need to have y=7 at t=21.\n\nFrom start, after how many actions.\n\nt=12 + H, y=7 at some t.\n\nSet t=21, y=7 at t=21.\n\nThen we need to have taken actions from t=12 to t=20, 9 actions, to reach y=7 at t=21? After m actions, at turn t=12+m, y is set.\n\nAt turn t=12, after 0 actions, y=0.\n\nAfter first action at t=12, y_{13} set.\n\nGenerally, after k actions, at turn t=12+k, y_{12+k} is the position.\n\nWe want y_{12+k} =7 at some k.\n\nAt turn t=21, which is t=12+9, so after 9 actions, y_{21} =7.\n\nBut we need to go to y=9, so we need more actions.\n\nFirst, to be at y=7 at t=21.\n\nt=21, y=7.\n\nThen from there, we can go up to y=8 and y=9.\n\nBut we need to check other constraints.\n\nFirst, to reach y=7 at t=21, we need to have taken 9 actions from t=12 to t=20, with net +7 in y, since start y=0.\n\nEach action: U: +1, D: -1, S:0.\n\nSo let U be number of U, D number of D, S number of S.\n\nThen U - D =7 (net up to y=7)\n\nAnd U + D + S =9 (number of actions to reach after 9 actions at t=21)\n\nThen S = 9 - U - D\n\nFrom U - D =7, and U + D + S =9.\n\nWe want to minimize total H, but for now, to reach y=7 at t=21.\n\nBut we need to go further to y=9.\n\nSince we have to avoid being on y=7 during t=18-20, and we cannot be before, so we must be after, at t=21 or later.\n\nt=21 is possible.\n\nThen from y=7 at t=21, we can go to y=8 and y=9.\n\nNow, freeway 8 is unsafe at t=24,25,26, which is later, so if we go up quickly, we can be on y=8 before t=24.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut we need to make sure that during the path to y=7, we don't have collisions.\n\nFirst, let's plan the sequence to reach y=7 at t=21.\n\nAt t=21, y=7.\n\nAfter 9 actions from t=12 to t=20.\n\ny_{21} = sum of Δy from t=12 to t=20 actions.\n\nΔy for each action.\n\nStart y_{12}=0.\n\nAfter action at t=12, y_{13} = y_{12} + Δy_{12}\n\n...\n\nAfter action at t=20, y_{21} = y_{20} + Δy_{20}\n\nWe want y_{21} =7.\n\nAlso, y_t for t from 13 to 21 must not be on unsafe freeway at that time.\n\ny_t between 1 and 8.\n\nNow, to have y_{21}=7, with min actions, but we are using 9 actions to go from y=0 to y=7, which normally takes 7 actions, so we have 2 extra actions that are not net up, so we must have 2 S or D or combination.\n\nSince D would decrease y, we need more U to compensate, which might increase H, so better to use S to waste time without changing y.\n\nSo add 2 S actions somewhere.\n\nThen U - D =7, and U + D + S =9.\n\nSince we add S, D=0, so U =7, S=2, then U + S =9, D=0.\n\nU - D =7, D=0, so U=7.\n\nThen U + D + S =7 +0 + S =9, so S=2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo 7 U and 2 S actions in the first 9 actions to reach y=7 at t=21.\n\nNow, where to place the S actions to avoid collisions.\n\nWe need to choose when to stay, so that at each turn, when on freeway, it is safe.\n\nNow, the unsafe periods:\n\nFreeway 1: unsafe t=24,25,26 — late, not issue yet\n\nFreeway 2: same\n\nFreeway 3,4,5: unsafe t=12,13,14\n\nFreeway 6: unsafe t=14\n\nFreeway 7: unsafe t=18,19,20 — we are avoiding being on it at these times\n\nFreeway 8: unsafe late\n\nIn the sequence to y=7 at t=21, we are on lower freeways earlier.\n\nt from 13 to 21.\n\ny from 1 to 7 at various times.\n\nSince we have S actions, we can stay at some y to delay.\n\nNow, freeways 3,4,5 unsafe at t=12,13,14.\n\nt=12 is the start, player at y=0, not on freeway.\n\nAt t=13, if y=1 or higher, but y=1 is freeway 1, which is safe at t=13.\n\nFreeway 1 safe at t=13.\n\nBut freeway 3,4,5 unsafe if on them at t=13.\n\nSimilarly t=14.\n\nTo avoid being on freeway 3,4,5 at t=13 or t=14.\n\nSince we need to go up, we might be on low y at early times.\n\nList the times and possible y.\n\nAt t=13: we can be on y=0 or y=1, depending on action at t=12.\n\nIf a12=U, y13=1; if a12=S, y13=0; if a12=D, y13=0 but y decreases, not good, better not D.\n\nSimilarly.\n\ny=0 at t=13 is safe, not freeway.\n\ny=1 at t=13: freeway 1, safe since not unsafe time.\n\nFreeway 1 unsafe only at 24-26.\n\nAt t=14: y could be 0,1,2.\n\ny=0: safe\n\ny=1: freeway 1, safe\n\ny=2: freeway 2, safe\n\nFreeway 3,4,5 unsafe at t=13 and t=14, but at t=13, if on y=3,4,5, but at t=13, y<=1 or 2 if we go up, but from start, at t=13, y<=1, so cannot be on y=3,4,5 at t=13, similarly at t=14, y<=2, so cannot be on y=3,4,5. So freeway 3,4,5 unsafe at t=12,13,14, but at t=12, player at y=0, not on; at t=13, y<=1 <3, not on; at t=14, y<=2<3, not on. So actually, we cannot be on freeway 3,4,5 at t=13 or 14 anyway, because y is too low. Similarly, freeway 6 unsafe at t=14, but at t=14, y<=2, freeway 6 is y=6, so not on it. So no issue for t=13 and t=14 with high freeways.\n\nThe only constraint from early times is that we should not be on freeway 3,4,5 at t=12, but t=12 player at y=0, so no problem.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6 unsafe at t=14, but y<=2 at t=14, so not on it.\n\nTherefore, for t=13 and t=14, we can be on y=1 or 2 safely, since freeway 1 and 2 are safe except late.\n\nNow, the main issue is freeway 7 at t=18,19,20, which we avoid by being on y=7 at t=21.\n\nNow, we also have freeway 8 to consider later, but we will reach it after.\n\nNow, back to the sequence.\n\nWe need to have y_{21} =7 with 7 U and 2 S in actions from t=12 to t=20.\n\nThe actions affect the y at each turn.\n\nStart t=12, y=0\n\nWe apply a_{12} to a_{20}, 9 actions, to set y_{13} to y_{21}.\n\ny_{21} =7.\n\nSince we start y=0, and end y=7, net +7, with 9 actions, so 2 S.\n\nNow, we need to choose when to do the S actions so that during the path, when on freeway, it is safe.\n\nThe critical part is around t=18,19,20 for y=7, but we are not on y=7 until t=21.\n\nAt t=18,19,20, we might be on other y.\n\nFor example, at t=18,19,20, if we are on y=7, unsafe, but we won't be.\n\nBut we might be on y=6 or y=8, etc.\n\nFreeway 6 is safe except t=14, which is early, so at t=18,19,20, freeway 6 is safe.\n\nFreeway 8 unsafe at t=24,25,26, so at t=18,19,20, if on y=8, safe.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways.\n\nBut freeway 7 is the only one with unsafe at t=18,19,20.\n\nSo as long as we are not on y=7 at those times, we are fine for other y.\n\nIn the sequence to y=7 at t=21, we need to ensure that for t=18,19,20, we are not on y=7, which we won't be since y_{21}=7.\n\ny_{21}=7, so at t=21, y=7.\n\nAt t=18,19,20, y <=6 or something, but since we have S actions, y might be less.\n\nBut at t=18,19,20, y could be from, say, 4 to 7, but since not 7, and freeway 7 unsafe only if on it, so for other y, no issue.\n\nFor example, at t=18, if on y=6, freeway 6, safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nNow, we just need to place the 2 S actions somewhere where it doesn't cause issue, but since all freeways are safe except specific times, and we are not at risk at early times for high y, we can place S actions at any point, but to minimize the time to reach y=9 later, we might place them early or late, but since we have to use them, it doesn't matter for the path to y=7.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9 after.\n\nFirst, let's get to y=7 at t=21.\n\nFor example, we can do the S actions at the beginning.\n\nt=12: action S, y13=0\n\nt=13: action S, y14=0? But we need to go up.\n\nActions:\n\nWe need to have y_{21}=7.\n\nStart y12=0\n\nAfter a12, y13 = 0 + Δy12\n\n...\n\nAfter a20, y21 = y20 + Δy20\n\nWe need y21=7.\n\nAlso, the actions include 7 U and 2 S.\n\nD=0.\n\nNow, for simplicity, we can have the S actions at t=12 and t=13, for example.\n\nThen:\n\nt=12: a12=S, y13=0\n\nt=13: a13=S, y14=0\n\nThen we need to go from y=0 at t=14 to y=7 at t=21, which is 7 U in 7 actions.\n\nt=14: y=0\n\na14: U, y15=1\n\nt=15: y=1\n\na15: U, y16=2\n\nt=16: y=2\n\na16: U, y17=3\n\nt=17: y=3, freeway 3, safe since t=17>14\n\na17: U, y18=4\n\nt=18: y=4, freeway 4, safe\n\na18: U, y19=5\n\nt=19: y=5, freeway 5, safe\n\na19: U, y20=6\n\nt=20: y=6, freeway 6, safe (t=20≠14)\n\na20: U, y21=7\n\nt=21: y=7, freeway 7, now t=21>20, safe.\n\nGood.\n\nWe could place S later, but this works.\n\nNow, from here, we need to go to y=9.\n\nAt t=21, y=7.\n\nWe can go up.\n\nBut freeway 7 is now safe.\n\na21: U, y22=8\n\nt=22: y=8, freeway 8.\n\nNow, freeway 8 unsafe at t=24,25,26.\n\nt=22<24, safe.\n\na22: U, y23=9\n\nt=23: y=9, done.\n\nBut y=9 is not a freeway, no cars, safe.\n\nSo we reached at t=23 with y=9.\n\nH is the number of actions to reach, so from t=12 to t=22, we took actions a12 to a22, 11 actions.\n\nt=12 to t=22 inclusive? Actions from t=12 to t=22, that's 11 actions (t=12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22), and at t=23, y=9.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t=12+H, y=9.\n\nHere, after 11 actions, t=12+11=23, y=9.\n\nIn the sequence: actions at t=12 to t=22, 11 actions.\n\nWe can list.\n\nBut is this minimal H?\n\nEarlier with all U, we could reach in 9 actions but had collision.\n\nWith one S, we could reach in 10 actions? Let's see.\n\nIf we add only one S, can we avoid collision?\n\nSuppose we add one S somewhere.\n\nThen to reach y=7 at t=20, for example.\n\nAt t=20, y=7.\n\nAfter 8 actions? t=12 to t=19 actions, 8 actions, to set y_{20}.\n\ny_{20} =7.\n\nThen U - D =7, U + D + S =8.\n\nWith D=0, U=7, S=1.\n\nThen U + S =8, so S=1.\n\nThen y_{20}=7.\n\nBut at t=20, y=7, but freeway 7 unsafe at t=20.\n\nExactly when we are on it.\n\nIf we reach y=7 at t=20, we are on it at t=20, unsafe.\n\nIf we reach at t=19, also unsafe.\n\nt=19 and t=20 both unsafe.\n\nOnly t=21 or later is safe.\n\nBut to reach y=7 at t=21, we need 9 actions as above.\n\nWith one S, we can reach y=7 at t=20, but t=20 unsafe.\n\nWe could be on y=7 at a different time, but impossible before t=19.\n\nSo we must use at least two extra actions to delay to t=21 for y=7.\n\nThus minimal H to reach y=9: since we need to go to y=9, with delays.\n\nFrom above, to reach y=7 at t=21 with 9 actions (7U,2S), then from y=7 to y=9, 2 more U actions, at t=21 and t=22, reaching y=9 at t=23.\n\nTotal actions: 11.\n\nBut we could reach y=9 directly with delays.\n\nFor example, with 11 actions: 9U and 2S, net +9, to y=9 at t=23.\n\nBut we might save one action if we can avoid one delay.\n\nBut we need the delay for y=7.\n\nAnother idea: instead of delaying to y=7, we could go down at some point to avoid, but going down might not help and increase H.\n\nFor example, suppose we go up to y=6 quickly, then stay or something.\n\nIn all U path: at t=18, y=6 (after a17 U).\n\nt=18: y=6, safe.\n\nInstead of going up to y=7 at t=19, we can stay at y=6 for one turn.\n\nThen:\n\nt=18: y=6, action a18: S, then y19=6\n\nt=19: y=6, freeway 6, safe (t=19≠14)\n\nThen a19: U, y20=7\n\nt=20: y=7, but t=20 unsafe for y=7.\n\nStill unsafe.\n\nIf we stay twice: a18: S, y19=6\n\nt=19: y=6, action S, y20=6\n\nt=20: y=6, action U, y21=7\n\nt=21: y=7, safe.\n\nThen from here go up.\n\nBut to reach y=6 earlier.\n\nIn all U: at t=18, y=6.\n\nWe stayed two extra turns at y=6, so we reach y=7 at t=21.\n\nThen to y=9: a21: U, y22=8; a22: U, y23=9.\n\nSame as before, 11 actions total? From start.\n\nOriginal all U: to reach y=6 at t=18: actions from t=12 to t=17: 6 actions? Let's count.\n\nt=12: start y=0\n\na12: U, t=13 y=1\n\n...\n\na17: U, t=18 y=6 (after 6 actions)\n\nThen a18: S, t=19 y=6\n\na19: S, t=20 y=6\n\na20: U, t=21 y=7\n\na21: U, t=22 y=8\n\na22: U, t=23 y=9\n\nActions from t=12 to t=22, 11 actions, same as before.\n\nIn the first approach, we had S at the beginning.\n\nBut H=11.\n\nCan we reach faster?\n\nSuppose we go up to y=5 or something and wait.\n\nBut freeway 5 is safe after t=14, etc.\n\nBut we need to pass y=7 eventually.\n\nSince freeway 8 has unsafe times late, but we reach early.\n\nAnother point: in the sequence above, when we go to y=8 at t=22, freeway 8 unsafe at t=24,25,26, t=22<24, safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut if we can reach y=9 earlier with different path.\n\nMinimal H is 9, but impossible due to collision.\n\nH=10 might be possible if we can avoid with only one extra action.\n\nBut earlier with one S, we still had issue.\n\nSuppose we reach y=7 at t=19, but since unsafe, we move away immediately.\n\nBut at t=19, if we are on y=7, we collide, so we cannot be on it at that turn.\n\nThe collision is at the turn when we are on the freeway and 0 in car span.\n\nSo we must not be on y=7 at t=19.\n\nIf we are on y=7 at t=19, collision happens.\n\nWe need to not be on it.\n\nSo with one S, we might reach y=7 at t=20, but t=20 also unsafe.\n\nUnless we can be on y=7 at t=17, impossible.\n\nOr at t=21.\n\nSo must use at least two extra turns to delay.\n\nThus minimal H is 11.\n\nBut let's confirm with the sequence.\n\nIn the answer, we need the action sequence from t=12.\n\nFirst sequence with S at start:\n\nt=12: action S, so y13=0\n\nt=13: action S, y14=0\n\nt=14: action U, y15=1\n\nt=15: action U, y16=2\n\nt=16: action U, y17=3\n\nt=17: action U, y18=4\n\nt=18: action U, y19=5\n\nt=19: action U, y20=6\n\nt=20: action U, y21=7\n\nt=21: action U, y22=8\n\nt=22: action U, y23=9\n\nAt t=23, y=9.\n\nH=11 actions from t=12 to t=22.\n\nIn this, at each turn, when on freeway, check safety.\n\nt=15: y=1, freeway 1, T=15, not 24-26, safe.\n\nt=16: y=2, freeway 2, same, safe.\n\nt=17: y=3, freeway 3, T=17>14, safe.\n\nt=18: y=4, freeway 4, T=18>14, safe.\n\nt=19: y=5, freeway 5, T=19>14, safe.\n\nt=20: y=6, freeway 6, T=20≠14, safe.\n\nt=21: y=7, freeway 7, T=21>20, safe.\n\nt=22: y=8, freeway 8, T=22<24, safe.\n\nt=23: y=9, no freeway.\n\nAll safe.\n\nWe could place the S actions differently, but this works.\n\nTo have the S not at the beginning, but at other points, but H is the same.\n\nNow, for freeway 8, unsafe at t=24,25,26, but we are on it at t=22<24, so fine.\n\nIf we had reached later, might be issue, but not here.\n\nSo minimal H is 11.\n\nBut the problem asks for minimal number of turns H and the sequence.\n\nH=11.\n\nIn the sequence above, we have actions from t=12 to t=22.\n\nAnswer format should list actions starting from t_1=12.\n\nIn the boxed part.\n\nBut let's write the sequence.\n\nTurn t_12: a_{12} = S\n\nTurn t_13: a_{13} = S\n\nTurn t_14: a_{14} = U\n\nTurn t_15: a_{15} = U\n\nTurn t_16: a_{16} = U\n\nTurn t_17: a_{17} = U\n\nTurn t_18: a_{18} = U\n\nTurn t_19: a_{19} = U\n\nTurn t_20: a_{20} = U\n\nTurn t_21: a_{21} = U\n\nTurn t_22: a_{22} = U\n\nThen at turn t_23, y=9.\n\nIn the sequence, the last action is at t_22, and after that, at t_23, position is (0,9).\n\nH=11.\n\nBut in the action sequence, it should be from t=12 to t=12+H-1, so 11 actions.\n\nNow, to write in the format.\n\nBut we can have a shorter sequence if we go down and up, but that might not help.\n\nFor example, suppose at some point we go down to avoid, but it would take more actions.\n\nLike, go to y=6 at t=18, then go down to y=5 at t=19, but then we need to go up more, increasing H.\n\nNot better.\n\nSo H=11 is minimal.\n\nBut in the car states, for freeway 7, there is a car that might affect, but we avoided.\n\nAnother thing: in freeway 7, there are multiple cars, but we considered.\n\nNow, for the sequence, I think it's fine.\n\nBut in the answer, it should be written.\n\nBut let's make sure about the initial position.\n\nAt t=12, position (0,0), then action a12, then y13, etc.\n\nIn the sequence above, with two S at start.\n\nWe could place S later, but same H.\n\nFor example, suppose we go up to y=3 quickly, then stay.\n\nBut in any case.\n\nNow, about freeway 6: we have it at t=20 in the sequence, which is safe.\n\nFreeway 6 unsafe only at t=14, which is avoided.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think it's ok.\n\nNow, the minimal H is 11.\n\nBut let's see if we can do with H=10.\n\nSuppose H=10 actions, then at t=12+10=22, y=9.\n\nAfter 10 actions, net +9, so U - D =9, U + D + S =10.\n\nIf D=0, U=9, S=1.\n\nOr if S=0, U=10, D=1? U - D=9, U + D=10, then 2U=19, U=9.5, impossible, so S must be at least 1? U - D=9, U + D + S=10.\n\nSet D=0, then U=9, S=1.\n\nOr D=1, U=10, S=0? U - D=10-1=9, U+D+S=10+1+0=11>10, no.\n\nU + D + S = number of actions =10.\n\nU - D =9.\n\nThen (U - D) + 2D + S =9 + 2D + S =10? From equations:\n\nEq1: U - D =9\n\nEq2: U + D + S =10\n\nAdd eq1 and eq2: 2U + S =19\n\nSince U and S integers, possible if S=1, then 2U=18, U=9, then from eq1, 9 - D=9, D=0.\n\nOr S=3, 2U=16, U=8, then 8-D=9, D=-1 impossible.\n\nOr S=5, etc, not better.\n\nSo only possibility: U=9, S=1, D=0.\n\nWith one S.\n\nNow, we need to reach y=9 at t=22.\n\ny_{22}=9.\n\nAfter 10 actions from t=12 to t=21.\n\nt=12 to t=21 actions, 10 actions, y_{22}=9.\n\nNow, with 9U and 1S.\n\nWe need to avoid being on y=7 at t=18,19,20.\n\nBut with only one S, we cannot delay much.\n\nFor example, if we do S at some point, say early.\n\nt=12: S, y13=0\n\nThen a13 to a21: 9 actions to y22=9.\n\nBut with one S, we have 9U and 1S in total, but at t=12 we did S, so from t=13 to t=21, 9 actions with 9U? Let's see.\n\nActions: from t=12 to t=21, 10 actions.\n\ny start at t=12: 0.\n\nAfter a12, y13.\n\n...\n\nAfter a21, y22.\n\nWe want y22=9.\n\nWith 9U and 1S.\n\nFor example, a12: U, y13=1\n\na13: U, y14=2\n\na14: U, y15=3\n\na15: U, y16=4\n\na16: U, y17=5\n\na17: U, y18=6\n\nNow at t=18, y=6.\n\nIf a18: U, y19=7, but t=19 y=7, unsafe.\n\nIf a18: S, y19=6\n\nt=19: y=6, safe\n\nThen a19: U, y20=7, but t=20 y=7, unsafe.\n\nIf after a18: S, y19=6\n\nThen a19: something, but to reach y=9 at t=22.\n\nIf a19: U, y20=7, t=20 unsafe.\n\nIf a19: S, y20=6, then we need to go to y=9 from y=6 in two actions, impossible, max to y=8.\n\ny20=6, a20: U, y21=7; a21: U, y22=8, not 9.\n\ny22=8 <9.\n\nTo have y22=9, we need after 10 actions.\n\nIf we do S at t=18, y19=6\n\nThen a19: U, y20=7 → unsafe at t=20\n\na20: U, y21=8\n\na21: U, y22=9\n\nBut at t=20, y=7, unsafe.\n\nIf we do S at another time.\n\nSuppose we do S at t=15.\n\nt=12: U, y13=1\n\nt=13: U, y14=2\n\nt=14: U, y15=3\n\nt=15: S, y16=3 (stay)\n\nt=16: U, y17=4\n\nt=17: U, y18=5\n\nt=18: U, y19=6\n\nt=19: U, y20=7 → unsafe at t=20? t=20 position y=7.\n\nAt turn t=20, y=7, unsafe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nIf we do S later, same.\n\nThe only way to avoid y=7 at t=19 or 20 is to not reach it until t=21.\n\nBut with one S, if we do S early, we might reach y=7 later, but in the timeline.\n\nFor example, start:\n\nt=12: S, y13=0 (S action)\n\nt=13: U, y14=1\n\nt=14: U, y15=2\n\nt=15: U, y16=3\n\nt=16: U, y17=4\n\nt=17: U, y18=5\n\nt=18: U, y19=6\n\nt=19: U, y20=7 → unsafe at t=20\n\nt=20: U, y21=8\n\nt=21: U, y22=9\n\nBut at t=20, y=7, unsafe.\n\nIf we do S at t=19, but t=19: if y=6, a19: S, y20=6, then a20: U, y21=7, a21: U, y22=8, not 9.\n\ny22=8, need another action to y23=9.\n\nThen H=11.\n\nThus, impossible with H=10; must have H=11.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 11.\n\nNow, for the sequence, we can use the one I have.\n\nIn the sequence, with two S at beginning, but we can place one S earlier and one later, but not necessary.\n\nTo make it cleaner, perhaps place the S not at start, but it doesn't matter.\n\nIn the answer format.\n\nAlso, for freeway 7, at t=21, it is safe, as computed.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nNow, write the sequence.\n\nTurn t_12: S\n\nTurn t_13: S\n\nTurn t_14: U\n\nTurn t_15: U\n\nTurn t_16: U\n\nTurn t_17: U\n\nTurn t_18: U\n\nTurn t_19: U\n\nTurn t_20: U\n\nTurn t_21: U\n\nTurn t_22: U\n\nIn this, after a22 U, at t=23, y=9.\n\nThe sequence has 11 actions.\n\nTo box it.\n\nBut in the format, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc.\n\nt_1 is 12.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn t_12: a_{t_12} = S\n\nTurn t_13: a_{t_13} = S\n\nTurn t_14: a_{t_14} = U\n\nTurn t_15: a_{t_15} = U\n\nTurn t_16: a_{t_16} = U\n\nTurn t_17: a_{t_17} = U\n\nTurn t_18: a_{t_18} = U\n\nTurn t_19: a_{t_19} = U\n\nTurn t_20: a_{t_20} = U\n\nTurn t_21: a_{t_21} = U\n\nTurn t_22: a_{t_22} = U\n\nAnd that should be it.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn t_19, y=5, which is freeway 5, safe; t_20, y=6, freeway 6, safe; t_21, y=7, freeway 7, safe; etc.\n\nYes.\n\nSo minimal H=11.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 12\\) is 11. This requires a sequence of actions that avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) at all times.\n\nThe unsafe times for each freeway, based on car positions and movements, are:\n- Freeway 1: unsafe at turns 24, 25, 26\n- Freeway 2: unsafe at turns 24, 25, 26\n- Freeway 3: unsafe at turns 12, 13, 14\n- Freeway 4: unsafe at turns 12, 13, 14\n- Freeway 5: unsafe at turns 12, 13, 14\n- Freeway 6: unsafe only at turn 14\n- Freeway 7: unsafe at turns 18, 19, 20\n- Freeway 8: unsafe at turns 24, 25, 26\n\nTo minimize \\(H\\), the player must reach \\(y = 9\\) as quickly as possible while avoiding these unsafe states. The direct path with all \"U\" actions would reach \\(y = 9\\) by turn 21 (after 9 actions) but results in a collision on freeway 7 at turn 19. Adding two \"S\" (stay) actions delays the arrival at \\(y = 7\\) until turn 21, avoiding the unsafe period for freeway 7 (turns 18–20). The sequence uses 9 \"U\" and 2 \"S\" actions over 11 turns to achieve \\(y = 9\\) at turn 23.\n\nThe action sequence is:\n- At turn 12, stay (S) to remain at \\(y = 0\\) (safe, not on a freeway).\n- At turn 13, stay (S) to remain at \\(y = 0\\) (safe).\n- From turns 14 to 22, move up (U) each turn to increase \\(y\\) from 1 to 9.\n\nThis sequence ensures:\n- At turn 15 (\\(y = 1\\), freeway 1): safe (turn 15 not unsafe for freeway 1).\n- At turn 16 (\\(y = 2\\), freeway 2): safe.\n- At turn 17 (\\(y = 3\\), freeway 3): safe (turn 17 > 14).\n- At turn 18 (\\(y = 4\\), freeway 4): safe (turn 18 > 14).\n- At turn 19 (\\(y = 5\\), freeway 5): safe (turn 19 > 14).\n- At turn 20 (\\(y = 6\\), freeway 6): safe (turn 20 ≠ 14).\n- At turn 21 (\\(y = 7\\), freeway 7): safe (turn 21 > 20).\n- At turn 22 (\\(y = 8\\), freeway 8): safe (turn 22 < 24).\n- At turn 23 (\\(y = 9\\)): target reached, no freeway.\n\nThus, \\(H = 11\\) is minimal, as \\(H = 10\\) would require being on freeway 7 during an unsafe turn or failing to reach \\(y = 9\\) in 10 actions.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } t_{12}: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_{13}: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_{14}: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_{15}: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_{16}: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_{17}: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_{18}: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_{19}: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_{20}: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_{21}: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_{22}: U \\end{array} }",

Since it's right-moving, the span is [tail, head] so [ -59, -48 ] at t=18.\n\nDirection right: span is [τ, h] so tail τ, head h. Here τ = -59, h = -48, so span [ -59, -48 ].\n\n- Freeway 2: same as freeway 1: [ -59, -48 ], right, speed 4.\n\n- Freeway 3: two cars: first (48, 37, right, 4) and second (0, -11, right, 4).\n\nFirst car: h=48, τ=37, right, so span [37,48] since [τ,h] for right.\n\nSecond car: h=0, τ=-11, right, so span [-11,0].\n\nBut h=0, τ=-11, so [ -11, 0 ].\n\n- Freeway 4: same as freeway 3: one car [37,48] and one [-11,0], both right, speed 4.\n\n- Freeway 5: same as 3 and 4: [37,48] and [-11,0], right, speed 4.\n\n- Freeway 6: one car: (48, 83, left, 36). Direction left, so for left-moving, span is [h, τ] but it says head h, tail τ, and for left-moving, span is [h, τ] with h being the front? Let's see the update.\n\nIn the car update: left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nHere it says head h, tail τ, so for left-moving, since it's moving left, decreasing x, the head is at higher x? I think I need to interpret the coordinates.\n\nThe freeway is a horizontal line, I assume x-axis, and cars move left or right. The position is given as (x, y) but for cars, it's on a specific y-freeway, and x-position.\n\nThe collision is if the player is at (0, y) and for the car on that freeway, 0 (x=0) is in the car's span at that turn.\n\nFor freeway 6: head=48, tail=83, direction left, speed 36.\n\nBut head and tail: if direction left, and head is 48, tail is 83, that might imply head is left of tail? Typically, head is the front. For a left-moving car, the front (head) should be at a smaller x if moving left, but here head=48, tail=83, so if head=48 and tail=83, and moving left, that means the car extends from x=48 to x=83? But moving left, so head at 48, tail at 83, but that would mean the car is facing left with head at 48 and tail at 83, so as it moves left, x decreases.\n\nIn the span definition: for left-moving, Span = [h, τ] and it updates to [h - s dt, τ - s dt].\n\nSimilarly for right-moving, [τ, h] to [τ + s dt, h + s dt].\n\nIn this case, freeway 6: h=48, τ=83, left, so span [48,83] at t=18.\n\nBut [48,83] with h=48, τ=83, and moving left, so since τ=83 > h=48, the tail is at higher x, so the car is oriented with head left, tail right, but moving left, so the head is leading to the left.\n\nSimilarly for other cars.\n\nBut for collision, we care about when x=0 is in the span.\n\nNow freeway 7: cars: (48, 37, right, 4), (12, 1, right, 4), (-24, -35, right, 4)\n\nFor right-moving, span [τ,h] so:\n\nFirst car: τ=37, h=48, so [37,48]\n\nSecond car: τ=1, h=12, so [1,12]\n\nThird car: τ=-35, h=-24, so [-35,-24]\n\nAll right-moving, speed 4.\n\nFreeway 8: (-48, -59, right, 4), so τ=-59, h=-48, span [-59,-48]\n\nNow, the player starts at (0,0) at turn t1=18. y=0, but freeways are from y=1 to y=8, so y=0 and y=9 might be safe or something? The collision is only for freeways y=1 to 8, I think. Let me check.\n\nThe problem says: \"avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y = 1, …, 8\". And the player position is on a grid y=0 to 9, but cars only on y=1 to 8. So at y=0 and y=9, there are no cars, so no collision possible. So y=0 and y=9 are safe positions.\n\nThe goal is to reach (0,9), which is safe.\n\nPlayer starts at (0,0), also safe, but we need to go to (0,9).\n\nTo move up, we need to go through y=1 to 8, where there are cars.\n\nWe need to find a sequence of actions to go from y=0 to y=9 in min turns, avoiding being on a freeway y=k at turn T when x=0 is in some car's span on that freeway at turn T.\n\nSince the player moves at turn T, and position changes after action, let's clarify the timing.\n\nAt turn t, the player has position y_t, and takes action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nThe collision is checked at each turn T for the position y_T. If at turn T, y_T is between 1 and 8, then we check if x=0 is in any car span on freeway y_T at that turn T.\n\nThe note emphasizes that when you move, at the turn you move, you are still on the old freeway for collision purposes. For example, if at turn T you are on y_T, and you move to y_{T+1} = y_T + delta, then at turn T, you are on y_T, so collision check on freeway y_T. At turn T+1, you are on y_{T+1}, so check on that freeway.\n\nAlso, since y changes after action, at the start of turn t, position is y_t, then action a_t is taken, then y_{t+1} is set.\n\nBut for collision, it says \"at turn T\", and \"for freeway y_T\", so I think y_T is the position at the beginning of turn T.\n\nLet me read.\n\n\"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd y_T is the player's position at turn T.\n\nFrom player update: y_{t+1} depends on a_t, so at time t, position y_t.\n\nSo at turn t, position is y_t.\n\nThen for collision at turn t: if y_t ∈ {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}, and for that freeway, x=0 in some car span at time t.\n\nNow, to reach y=9 from y=0, since we can only change by -1,0,+1 per turn, the minimum number of turns is 9, if we go up every turn: U,U,U,U,U,U,U,U,U to go from 0 to 9 in 9 steps.\n\nBut we might have to wait or go down to avoid cars, so H could be more than 9.\n\nBut we need minimal H, so probably 9 if possible, else more.\n\nBut with cars, we might need to delay.\n\nFirst, I need to simulate the car positions over time.\n\nLet t be the turn number, starting from t=18.\n\nAt turn t, for each freeway, the car spans at time t.\n\nSince t1=18, for future turn T, dt = T - 18.\n\nFor each car, given its state at t=18, we can compute Span at time T.\n\nThen for the player to be safe at turn T on freeway k, we need that for all cars on freeway k, 0 not in Span(T).\n\nIf there are multiple cars on a freeway, we need 0 not in any of their spans.\n\nNow, let's list for each freeway the cars and their span functions over time.\n\nDefine dt = t - 18, so at t=18, dt=0.\n\nFor freeway 1: one car, right-moving, span at t: [τ + s dt, h + s dt] = [-59 + 4 dt, -48 + 4 dt]\n\nSince [τ, h] and right, so Span(T) = [τ + s (T-t1), h + s (T-t1)] = [-59 + 4 dt, -48 + 4 dt]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same as freeway 1: [-59 + 4 dt, -48 + 4 dt]\n\nFreeway 3: two cars.\n\nFirst car: right, [37,48] at t=18, so Span(T) = [37 + 4 dt, 48 + 4 dt]\n\nSecond car: right, [-11,0] at t=18, so Span(T) = [-11 + 4 dt, 0 + 4 dt] = [-11 + 4 dt, 4 dt]\n\nFreeway 4: same as freeway 3: car1 [37 + 4 dt, 48 + 4 dt], car2 [-11 + 4 dt, 4 dt]\n\nFreeway 5: same.\n\nFreeway 6: left-moving, one car: at t=18, span [h, τ] = [48,83], since h=48, τ=83, left.\n\nThen Span(T) = [h - s dt, τ - s dt] = [48 - 36 dt, 83 - 36 dt]\n\ns=36.\n\nFreeway 7: three cars, all right-moving.\n\nFirst car: [37,48] at t=18, so [37 + 4 dt, 48 + 4 dt]\n\nSecond car: [1,12] at t=18, so [1 + 4 dt, 12 + 4 dt]\n\nThird car: [-35,-24] at t=18, so [-35 + 4 dt, -24 + 4 dt]\n\nFreeway 8: one car, right, [-59,-48] at t=18, so [-59 + 4 dt, -48 + 4 dt]\n\nNow, the player starts at t=18, y=0, which is safe.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at some turn, say t=18+H-1 or something.\n\nLet me define the turns: let t be absolute turn, starting from t=18.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t.\n\nAction a_t taken, y_{t+1} = y_t + delta, with delta from a_t.\n\nCollision at turn t if y_t between 1 and 8, and 0 in some car span on freeway y_t at time t.\n\nTo have no collision, for each turn when y_t in 1-8, the condition must not hold.\n\nNow, we need to find a sequence of actions from t=18 to some t=18+H-1 such that y_{18+H-1} =9, and for all t from 18 to 18+H-2, if y_t in 1-8, no collision at t.\n\nAt turn t, y_t is position, and we check collision at t based on y_t.\n\nThen we take action a_t, go to y_{t+1}, and so on.\n\nThe last position is y_{18+H-1} =9.\n\nThe sequence of actions is from t=18 to t=18+H-2, I think, for H turns.\n\nLet's clarify.\n\nSuppose we start at t=18 with y_18 =0.\n\nWe take actions a_18, a_19, ..., up to a_{18+H-1} for H actions, then y_{18+H} = y after H actions.\n\nBut we need y at turn T to be 9 for some T.\n\nAt turn T, position y_T.\n\nAfter H actions, we have y_{18+H}.\n\nWe want y_{18+H} =9.\n\nThe turns involved are from t=18 to t=18+H.\n\nAt each turn t, we have y_t, and we check collision at t if y_t in 1-8.\n\nFor t=18, y_18=0, safe.\n\nThen we take a_18, go to y_19, and so on, up to when y_T=9 for T=18+H.\n\nThen the actions are a_18 to a_{18+H-1}, for H actions, and positions y_18 to y_{18+H}.\n\ny_{18+H} =9.\n\nThe sequence has H actions, from t=18 to t=18+H-1.\n\nAnswer format: Turn t_1: a_{t1}, Turn t1+1: a_{t1+1}, ..., up to Turn t1 + H-1: a_{t1+H-1}\n\nAnd y_{t1 + H} =9.\n\nt1=18.\n\nMinimal H.\n\nSince we start at y=0 and end at y=9, min H is 9 if we go up every turn.\n\nBut with cars, it might not be possible at all times.\n\nSo I need to find when each freeway is safe at x=0.\n\nFor each freeway k, and at each time t, whether x=0 is occupied by a car.\n\nBut t is absolute turn.\n\nSince the player moves one step at a time, we need to plan the path.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway, the times when it is unsafe, i.e., when 0 is in some car's span.\n\nThen, for the player to be on freeway k at time t, it must be safe at that time.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are always safe.\n\nNow, let's compute for each freeway the set of t where it is unsafe.\n\nt is integer, since turns are discrete.\n\ndt = t - 18.\n\nFreeway 1: car span [ -59 + 4 dt, -48 + 4 dt ]\n\n0 in this span if -59 + 4 dt <= 0 <= -48 + 4 dt\n\nSo -59 + 4 dt <= 0 and 0 <= -48 + 4 dt\n\nFirst inequality: -59 + 4 dt <= 0 => 4 dt <= 59 => dt <= 59/4 = 14.75, so dt <= 14 since integer? dt integer? t integer, dt = t-18 integer.\n\ndt integer.\n\n-59 + 4 dt <= 0 => 4 dt <= 59 => dt <= 14.75, so dt <= 14\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= -48 + 4 dt => 48 <= 4 dt => dt >= 12\n\nSo dt >=12 and dt <=14\n\nThus for dt=12,13,14, which is t=30,31,32\n\nt=18 + dt, so for dt=12, t=30; dt=13, t=31; dt=14, t=32.\n\nSo freeway 1 unsafe at t=30,31,32.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2 same as freeway 1, unsafe at t=30,31,32.\n\nNow freeway 3: two cars.\n\nFirst car: [37 + 4 dt, 48 + 4 dt]\n\n0 in this if 37 + 4 dt <= 0 <= 48 + 4 dt\n\nBut 37 + 4 dt <=0? 37 + 4 dt >= 37 >0 for all dt, so 0 cannot be <= 37 + 4 dt since left is positive, so 0 not in this span. Always safe from first car.\n\nSecond car: [-11 + 4 dt, 4 dt]\n\n0 in this if -11 + 4 dt <= 0 <= 4 dt\n\nFirst: -11 + 4 dt <=0 => 4 dt <=11 => dt <= 2.75, dt <=2\n\nSecond: 0 <= 4 dt => dt >=0\n\nSo dt >=0 and dt <=2, so for dt=0,1,2, t=18,19,20\n\nAt t=18, dt=0, span [-11,0], so 0 is included, since [ -11,0], 0 is the endpoint.\n\nSimilarly, at t=19, dt=1, span [-11+4, 4] = [-7,4], 0 in it.\n\nt=20, dt=2, span [-11+8,8] = [-3,8], 0 in it.\n\nt=21, dt=3, span [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo for freeway 3, unsafe when second car has 0 in span, so t=18,19,20.\n\nBut at t=18, the player is at y=0, not on freeway 3, so for freeway 3, it is unsafe at t=18,19,20, but player might be on it at those times.\n\nNow freeway 4 same as freeway 3, unsafe t=18,19,20.\n\nSimilarly freeway 5 same, unsafe t=18,19,20.\n\nNow freeway 6: left-moving, span [48 - 36 dt, 83 - 36 dt]\n\n0 in this if 48 - 36 dt <= 0 <= 83 - 36 dt\n\nFirst inequality: 48 - 36 dt <=0 => 48 <= 36 dt => dt >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈1.333, so dt >= 2 since integer? dt >= ceil(1.333) = 2\n\ndt >= 2\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= 83 - 36 dt => 36 dt <= 83 => dt <= 83/36 ≈ 2.305, so dt <= 2\n\nThus dt >=2 and dt <=2, so only dt=2.\n\nAt dt=2, span [48-72, 83-72] = [-24, 11], and 0 is in [-24,11], yes.\n\nAt dt=1, span [48-36,83-36] = [12,47], 0 not in.\n\ndt=3, [48-108,83-108] = [-60,-25], 0 not in.\n\nSo freeway 6 unsafe only at t=18+2=20.\n\nt=20.\n\nNow freeway 7: three cars.\n\nFirst car: [37 + 4 dt, 48 + 4 dt], min 37>0, so 0 never in, safe.\n\nSecond car: [1 + 4 dt, 12 + 4 dt], min 1>0, so 0 never in, safe? At dt=0, [1,12], 0 not in. Yes, since 1>0, so 0 not in [1,12] or later.\n\nThird car: [-35 + 4 dt, -24 + 4 dt]\n\n0 in this if -35 + 4 dt <= 0 <= -24 + 4 dt\n\nFirst: -35 + 4 dt <=0 => 4 dt <=35 => dt <= 35/4=8.75, dt <=8\n\nSecond: 0 <= -24 + 4 dt => 24 <= 4 dt => dt >=6\n\nSo dt >=6 and dt <=8, so dt=6,7,8, t=24,25,26.\n\nAt these times, unsafe due to third car.\n\nNow freeway 8: same as freeway 1, unsafe at t=30,31,32.\n\nFreeway 8: [-59 +4 dt, -48 +4 dt], same as freeway 1, unsafe t=30,31,32.\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway, unsafe times:\n\n- y=1: unsafe t=30,31,32\n\n- y=2: same, t=30,31,32\n\n- y=3: unsafe t=18,19,20\n\n- y=4: unsafe t=18,19,20\n\n- y=5: unsafe t=18,19,20\n\n- y=6: unsafe only t=20\n\n- y=7: unsafe t=24,25,26\n\n- y=8: unsafe t=30,31,32\n\ny=6 unsafe only at t=20.\n\nNow, the player starts at t=18, y=0.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\ny=9 is always safe.\n\nThe minimal path would be to go up as fast as possible, but avoiding the unsafe times.\n\nSince we start at t=18, and y=3,4,5 are unsafe from t=18 to 20, so we cannot be on y=3,4,5 at t=18,19,20.\n\nAt t=18, we are at y=0, safe.\n\nIf we go up at t=18, we go to y=1 at t=19? Let's see positions over time.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t.\n\nt=18: y=0\n\nAction a_18: if U, then y_19 = y_18 +1 =1\n\nIf S, y_19=0\n\nIf D, y_19=-1, but y min=0, so cannot go below 0, I assume y in [0,9], so if at y=0, D might be invalid or set to 0, but the move: Δy_t, and y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with y in [0,9], so if at y=0 and a_t=D, y_{t+1} = max(0, y_t -1) =0, similarly at y=9, U sets to 9.\n\nBut in this case, at y=0, D or S keeps y=0.\n\nBut we want to go up, so probably not down.\n\nSimilarly, at y=9, we stay.\n\nBut here we start at y=0.\n\nTo reach y=9, min 9 up moves, but we might need to stay or move down to avoid.\n\nNow, back to unsafe times.\n\ny=3,4,5 unsafe at t=18,19,20. But at t=18, y=3,4,5 would be unsafe, but player is at y=0, so not on those.\n\nThe issue is when we are on these rows at those times.\n\nFor example, if we want to be on y=3 at some t, it must not be t=18,19,20.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\ny=6 unsafe only at t=20.\n\ny=7 unsafe at t=24,25,26.\n\ny=1 and y=2 unsafe at t=30,31,32, but since we start early, t=18, and y=1,2 might be safe at other times.\n\ny=1 and y=2: from above, only unsafe at t=30,31,32, so for t<30 or t>32, they are safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=3,4,5 unsafe only t=18,19,20, so for t<18 or t>20, safe.\n\nt<18 not relevant, since we start at t=18.\n\nt>20: t>=21 safe for y=3,4,5.\n\ny=6 unsafe only t=20, so safe for t<20 or t>20, i.e., all t except 20.\n\ny=7 unsafe t=24,25,26, safe otherwise.\n\ny=8 unsafe t=30,31,32, safe otherwise.\n\nNow, the player starts at t=18, y=0.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 asap.\n\nSince y=0 to y=9, min 9 moves up.\n\nBut let's see if we can go directly up from t=18.\n\nAt t=18: y=0, safe. Action: if we go U, then y_19=1.\n\nBut at t=19, y=1, is it safe? y=1 is freeway, and at t=19, is it unsafe?\n\ny=1 unsafe only at t=30,31,32, so at t=19, y=1 should be safe, since no car issue at that time.\n\nSimilarly, y=2 also safe at t=19.\n\nBut y=3,4,5 unsafe at t=19.\n\nLet's simulate.\n\nOption 1: go straight up as fast as possible.\n\nStart t=18, y=0\n\na_18 = U, y_19=1\n\nt=19, y=1: y=1 safe?

Yes, safe.\n\nAction a_21: U, y_22=4\n\nt=22, y=4: freeway 4, at t=22, dt=4.\n\nUnsafe times t=18,19,20, t=22>20, safe.\n\nCars: similar, [37+16,48+16]=[53,64], [-11+16,16]=[5,16], 0 not in.\n\nAction a_22: U, y_23=5\n\nt=23, y=5: freeway 5, dt=5, cars [37+20,48+20]=[57,68], [-11+20,20]=[9,20], 0 not in, safe.\n\nAction a_23: U, y_24=6\n\nt=24, y=6: freeway 6, at t=24, dt=6.\n\ny=6 unsafe only at t=20, t=24≠20, so safe.\n\nCar: [48 - 36*6, 83 - 36*6] = [48-216, 83-216] = [-168,-133], 0 not in.\n\nAction a_24: U, y_25=7\n\nt=25, y=7: freeway 7, at t=25.\n\nBut y=7 unsafe at t=24,25,26.\n\nt=25 is unsafe.\n\nAt t=25, dt=7, freeway 7 cars: third car [-35 +4*7, -24 +4*7] = [-35+28, -24+28] = [-7,4], and 0 is in [-7,4], since -7<=0<=4, yes.\n\nSo at t=25, y=7 is unsafe.\n\nIf we are on y=7 at t=25, collision.\n\nIn this path, at t=25, y=7, which is unsafe.\n\nSo we cannot go up at t=24 to y=7 at t=25? Let's see.\n\nAt t=24, y=6, we take action a_24=U, then y_25=7.\n\nAt turn t=25, position y_25=7, so we check collision at t=25 on freeway 7, which is unsafe.\n\nSo we cannot do this action at t=24.\n\nWe need to avoid being on y=7 at t=24,25,26.\n\nSimilarly, in the above, we reached y=6 at t=24, but going to y=7 at t=25 is bad.\n\nWe could stay at y=6 for a while or something.\n\nBut let's continue the min path idea.\n\nFrom above, we can go from y=0 to y=6 by t=24, but then stuck because y=7 unsafe until t=27.\n\nt=24,25,26 unsafe for y=7.\n\nSafe at t=27 and later.\n\nSo at t=24, y=6, we can stay or move, but if we go U at t=24, y_25=7, unsafe.\n\nIf we go S, y_25=6, safe since y=6 safe at t=25.\n\nThen at t=25, y=6, we can go U to y_26=7, but at t=26, y=7 unsafe.\n\nt=26 y=7 unsafe.\n\nIf we stay at y=6 at t=25, then at t=25, y=6, safe.\n\nThen action a_25: if U, y_26=7, at t=26 y=7 unsafe.\n\nIf S, y_26=6, safe.\n\nThen at t=26, y=6, action a_26: if U, y_27=7.\n\nAt t=27, y=7: now t=27, dt=9, freeway 7, third car [-35+36, -24+36]=[1,12], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, other cars not issue.\n\nSo y=7 safe at t=27.\n\nThen we can go to y=7 at t=27.\n\nBut from t=24 to t=27, we stayed at y=6 for 3 turns? Let's see the sequence.\n\nIn the initial min path, we reached y=6 at t=24.\n\nThen:\n\nt=24: y=6, action S? Or D, but better to stay or up.\n\nAction a_24: if S, then y_25=6\n\nt=25: y=6, action S, y_26=6\n\nt=26: y=6, action U, y_27=7\n\nt=27: y=7, safe, as above.\n\nThen from there, we can go up.\n\nBut we have to reach y=9.\n\nAfter y=7 at t=27, we can go U to y=8, etc.\n\nBut y=8 has unsafe times at t=30,31,32.\n\nt=27 is early.\n\nNow, let's list the positions:\n\nStart t=18, y=0\n\na_18=U, y_19=1\n\nt=19, y=1, a_19=U, y_20=2\n\nt=20, y=2, a_20=U, y_21=3\n\nt=21, y=3, a_21=U, y_22=4\n\nt=22, y=4, a_22=U, y_23=5\n\nt=23, y=5, a_23=U, y_24=6\n\nNow at t=24, y=6, we need to not go to y=7 immediately.\n\nSo a_24: let's say S, then y_25=6\n\nt=25, y=6, a_25: S, y_26=6\n\nt=26, y=6, a_26: U, y_27=7\n\nt=27, y=7, now safe, a_27: U, y_28=8\n\nt=28, y=8: freeway 8, at t=28.\n\ny=8 unsafe at t=30,31,32, t=28<30, so safe? Freeway 8 car: [-59 +4*(28-18), -48 +4*10] = [-59+40, -48+40] = [-19,-8], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nAction a_28: U, y_29=9\n\nt=29, y=9, which is goal, and safe.\n\ny=9 no cars.\n\nSo at t=29, y=9 reached.\n\nNow, actions from t=18 to t=28? Let's list turns.\n\nt=18: y=0, action a_18=U\n\nt=19: y=1, action a_19=U\n\nt=20: y=2, action a_20=U\n\nt=21: y=3, action a_21=U\n\nt=22: y=4, action a_22=U\n\nt=23: y=5, action a_23=U\n\nt=24: y=6, action a_24=S (stay)\n\nt=25: y=6, action a_25=S (stay)\n\nt=26: y=6, action a_26=U\n\nt=27: y=7, action a_27=U\n\nt=28: y=8, action a_28=U\n\nThen y_29=9, at turn t=29.\n\nWe reached y=9 at turn t=29, so H such that t_1 + H =? t_1=18, we have actions from t=18 to t=28, that's 11 actions: t=18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28.\n\nt from 18 to 28 inclusive? Actions at t=18 to t=28, that's 11 actions.\n\nPositions: t=18:y=0, t=19:y=1, ..., up to t=28:y=8 after action? Let's list:\n\nAfter action a_t, y_{t+1} set.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t, take action a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + delta.\n\nSo for turn t, y_t.\n\nt=18: y_18=0, take a_18=U, set y_19=1\n\nt=19: y_19=1, take a_19=U, set y_20=2\n\n...\n\nt=23: y_23=5, take a_23=U, set y_24=6\n\nt=24: y_24=6, take a_24=S, set y_25=6\n\nt=25: y_25=6, take a_25=S, set y_26=6\n\nt=26: y_26=6, take a_26=U, set y_27=7\n\nt=27: y_27=7, take a_27=U, set y_28=8\n\nt=28: y_28=8, take a_28=U, set y_29=9\n\nNow, at turn t=29, y_29=9, which is the goal.\n\nWe took actions from t=18 to t=28, that's 11 actions.\n\nH is the number of actions, I think.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t=18 to t=28 inclusive, that's 11 turns: 18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28.\n\nBut we reached y=9 at t=29.\n\nMinimal H could be less? We had to stay at y=6 for two turns to avoid y=7 at bad times.\n\nBut is there a faster way?\n\nFor example, we could go slower earlier to avoid waiting.\n\nBut since y=3,4,5 are unsafe at t=18,19,20, we started going up at t=18 and passed y=3 at t=21, which is safe.\n\nWe had to delay at y=6.\n\nBut at t=20, we were at y=2, which is safe.\n\ny=6 is unsafe only at t=20, but we were not on it at t=20.\n\nIn the path, we reached y=6 at t=24.\n\nCould we reach earlier?\n\nSuppose we start later or something.\n\nAt t=18, we could stay at y=0 for a few turns, but that might not help, since we need to go up.\n\nFor example, if we stay at y=0 until t=20, then go up.\n\nt=18: y=0, a_18=S, y_19=0\n\nt=19: y=0, a_19=S, y_20=0? But at t=19, y=0 safe, but we are not moving.\n\nThen at t=20: y=0, a_20=U, y_21=1\n\nt=21: y=1, a_21=U, y_22=2\n\nt=22: y=2, a_22=U, y_23=3\n\nNow t=23, y=3, safe since t=23>20\n\na_23=U, y_24=4\n\nt=24: y=4, a_24=U, y_25=5\n\nt=25: y=5, a_25=U, y_26=6\n\nt=26: y=6, a_26=U, y_27=7\n\nBut at t=27, y=7 is safe? t=27, y=7 safe.\n\nThen a_27=U, y_28=8\n\na_28=U, y_29=9\n\nSame as before? Let's see: started going up at t=20, reached y=6 at t=26, then to y=7 at t=27.\n\nBut at t=26, y=6, a_26=U, y_27=7\n\nt=27, y=7 safe.\n\nThen y=8 at t=28, y=9 at t=29.\n\nBut in this case, we stayed at y=0 for two turns: t=18 and t=19 actions S? In this sequence:\n\nt=18: y=0, a_18=S, y_19=0\n\nt=19: y=0, a_19=S, y_20=0? y_20=0\n\nThen t=20: y=0, a_20=U, y_21=1\n\n...\n\nt=25: y=5? t=20:y=0, a_20=U, y_21=1\n\nt=21:y=1, a_21=U, y_22=2\n\nt=22:y=2, a_22=U, y_23=3\n\nt=23:y=3, a_23=U, y_24=4\n\nt=24:y=4, a_24=U, y_25=5\n\nt=25:y=5, a_25=U, y_26=6\n\nt=26:y=6, a_26=U, y_27=7\n\nt=27:y=7, a_27=U, y_28=8\n\nt=28:y=8, a_28=U, y_29=9\n\nNow, compared to first path: first path we had y=6 at t=24, but stayed until t=26, then to y=7 at t=27.\n\nHere we reached y=6 at t=26, immediately to y=7 at t=27, same as before.\n\nBut in this sequence, we have actions: t=18:S, t=19:S, t=20:U, t=21:U, t=22:U, t=23:U, t=24:U, t=25:U, t=26:U, t=27:U, t=28:U\n\nThat's 11 actions, to y_29=9.\n\nSame as before.\n\nIn the first sequence, we had 8 up moves and 2 stays, total 10 actions? Let's count first sequence:\n\nt=18:U (to y1)\n\nt=19:U (to y2)\n\nt=20:U (to y3)\n\nt=21:U (to y4)\n\nt=22:U (to y5)\n\nt=23:U (to y6)\n\nt=24:S (stay y6)\n\nt=25:S (stay y6)\n\nt=26:U (to y7)\n\nt=27:U (to y8)\n\nt=28:U (to y9)\n\nActions at t=18 to t=28: 11 actions.\n\nt=18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28: that's 11 turns.\n\nAfter a_28, y_29=9.\n\nCan we do with fewer?\n\nMin steps: from y=0 to y=9, min 9 up moves, but we need to avoid bad times.\n\nIn this case, we had to spend extra time at y=6 because y=7 was unsafe from t=24 to 26.\n\nBut we reached y=6 at t=24, and could only leave to y=7 at t=27, so must stay at y=6 for 3 turns? From t=24 to t=26, that's two actions: at t=24 and t=25 stay, then at t=26 go up.\n\nIn positions: at t=24 y=6, after a_24=S, y_25=6; t=25 y=6, after a_25=S, y_26=6; t=26 y=6, after a_26=U, y_27=7.\n\nSo from t=24 to t=26, we are at y=6 for turns t=24,25,26, and move to y=7 at t=27.\n\nBut at t=26, we are still at y=6, which is fine.\n\nThe earliest we can be on y=7 is t=27.\n\nSimilarly, in the alternative, if we delay start, we reach y=6 later, but still can go to y=7 at t=27.\n\nNow, what about y=8 and y=9? y=8 unsafe at t=30,31,32, but we are at t=28, which is before, so safe.\n\nWe can go directly.\n\nBut in the sequence above, we go to y=8 at t=28, y=9 at t=29.\n\nH=11 actions.\n\nBut is there a way to reach earlier?\n\nSuppose we go up faster to y=6, but we are already at y=6 at t=24.\n\nt=24 is when we first can be at y=6? From start, min time to y=6 is 6 steps: t=18 to t=23: y=0 to1,1to2,2to3,3to4,4to5,5to6 at t=24.\n\ny_24=6 after 6 up moves.\n\nThen we have to wait until t=27 to go to y=7.\n\nSo cannot reach y=7 before t=27.\n\nThen y=8 at t=28, y=9 at t=29.\n\nSo min arrival at y=9 is t=29, with 11 actions.\n\nBut H is the number of actions, from t=18 to t=28 for 11 actions.\n\nPerhaps we can go down or something to avoid, but that might take more time.\n\nFor example, at some point go down to y=0 and wait, but y=0 is safe, but going down and up takes extra steps.\n\nFor instance, after reaching y=6 at t=24, instead of staying, go down to y=5 or something, but y=5 is safe at t=24, but then we have to come back, which takes more actions.\n\nNot better.\n\nSimilarly, no need.\n\nSo H=11 seems necessary.\n\nBut let's confirm if we can be on y=7 earlier.\n\ny=7 unsafe at t=24,25,26.\n\nAt t=23, we are at y=5 or y=6.\n\nIf at t=23 y=5, we can go to y=6 at t=24.\n\nIf we go to y=7 at t=24? To be on y=7 at turn t, we need to have moved there.\n\nAt turn t, y_t position.\n\nTo be at y=7 at t=24: that means at t=24, position is 7.\n\nWhich requires that at t=23, y=6 or7, and action to set y=7.\n\nIf y=6 at t=23, action U, y_24=7.\n\nThen at t=24, y=7, which is unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, if y=7 at t=23, but we were not.\n\nEarliest y=7 can be safe is t=27.\n\nSimilarly, we cannot be on y=7 before t=27.\n\nHence, min time to reach y=7 is t=27.\n\nThen y=8 at t=28, y=9 at t=29.\n\nThus min H=11 actions to reach y_29=9.\n\nIn the sequence, actions at t=18 to t=28.\n\nIn the first sequence I had, with early up and wait at y=6.\n\nIn the sequence: actions:\n\nt=18: U\n\nt=19: U\n\nt=20: U\n\nt=21: U\n\nt=22: U\n\nt=23: U\n\nt=24: S\n\nt=25: S\n\nt=26: U\n\nt=27: U\n\nt=28: U\n\nThen y_29=9.\n\nIn the answer, we need to list for each turn the action.\n\nt1=18.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nTurn 20: U\n\nTurn 21: U\n\nTurn 22: U\n\nTurn 23: U\n\nTurn 24: S\n\nTurn 25: S\n\nTurn 26: U\n\nTurn 27: U\n\nTurn 28: U\n\nBut we have 11 actions, H=11.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 20, y=2, which is safe, as we computed.\n\nAt turn 20, y=2, freeway 2, car span at t=20, dt=2, [-59+8, -48+8]=[-51,-40], 0 not in, safe.\n\nAlso, y=6 at t=24,25,26: safe, since only unsafe at t=20.\n\nt=20 y=6 unsafe, but we are at y=2 or elsewhere.\n\nIn this sequence, at t=20, we are at y=2, not y=6.\n\nSo all good.\n\nPerhaps we can reduce H by going down and up, but unlikely to save time.\n\nFor example, suppose we go to y=6 earlier? But we are at y=6 at t=24, which is earliest possible from start.\n\nt=18:0, t19:1, t20:2, t21:3, t22:4, t23:5, t24:6. Yes, min.\n\nThen must stay until t=26 to move to y=7 at t=27.\n\nt=26 action U to y=7 at t=27.\n\nSo no better.\n\nThus minimal H=11.\n\nNow, about y=8 and y=9: in this path, we go to y=8 at t=28, which is before t=30, safe.\n\nThen to y=9 at t=29.\n\nIf we could go faster, but we can't.\n\nSo the sequence is as above.\n\nNow, in the answer format.\n\nWe need to output the actions for turns starting from t1=18.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nTurn 20: U\n\nTurn 21: U\n\nTurn 22: U\n\nTurn 23: U\n\nTurn 24: S\n\nTurn 25: S\n\nTurn 26: U\n\nTurn 27: U\n\nTurn 28: U\n\nAnd H=11.\n\nBut let's write in the box.\n\nThe problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\"\n\nIn the answer format, it shows the sequence, not H explicitly, but H is the number of actions.\n\nIn the box, we list the actions.\n\nNow, I think that's it.\n\nBut in freeway 7, we have other cars, but we checked only the third car matters.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nPerhaps we can avoid staying by taking a different path.\n\nFor example, at t=24, instead of staying at y=6, go down to y=5, but y=5 is safe, but then we need to go up again, which takes more steps.\n\nFor instance, at t=24 y=6, go D to y=5 at t=25, then at t=25 y=5, go S or U, but to reach y=7 later, we need more moves, not better.\n\nSimilarly, no.\n\nSo minimal is 11 turns.\n\nBut H=11 actions.\n\nNow, to confirm, from t=18 to t=28 actions, 11 actions.\n\nPositions: t=18:0, t=19:1, t=20:2, t=21:3, t=22:4, t=23:5, t=24:6, t=25:6, t=26:6, t=27:7, t=28:8, t=29:9.\n\nAt t=29 y=9.\n\nAll collisions avoided.\n\nAt t=20, y=2, safe.\n\nt=24, y=6, safe (dt=6, freeway 6 car [-168,-133], not 0)\n\nt=25, y=6, same.\n\nt=26, y=6, same.\n\nt=27, y=7, dt=9, freeway 7 cars: first [37+36,48+36]=[73,84], second [1+36,12+36]=[37,48], third [-35+36,-24+36]=[1,12], all not contain 0.\n\nt=28, y=8, dt=10, freeway 8 car [-59+40,-48+40]=[-19,-8], not 0.\n\nGood.\n\nSo the sequence is as above.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 0) at turn \\(t_1 = 18\\) and must reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\). The car positions and movements are determined based on their initial state at turn 18 and their speed and direction.\n\n### Analysis of Unsafe Times for Each Freeway\n- **Freeway 1**: Unsafe at turns 30, 31, 32 (due to car span including x=0).\n- **Freeway 2**: Unsafe at turns 30, 31, 32 (same as freeway 1).\n- **Freeway 3**: Unsafe at turns 18, 19, 20 (due to the second car).\n- **Freeway 4**: Unsafe at turns 18, 19, 20 (same as freeway 3).\n- **Freeway 5**: Unsafe at turns 18, 19, 20 (same as freeway 3).\n- **Freeway 6**: Unsafe only at turn 20.\n- **Freeway 7**: Unsafe at turns 24, 25, 26 (due to the third car).\n- **Freeway 8**: Unsafe at turns 30, 31, 32 (same as freeway 1).\n\n### Strategy for Minimal Turns\n- The minimal path without cars would require 9 turns (all \"U\" actions). However, due to unsafe times on freeways, waiting is necessary at \\(y=6\\) to avoid being on \\(y=7\\) during unsafe turns (24, 25, 26).\n- The earliest possible turn to reach \\(y=7\\) safely is turn 27, as it is safe from turn 27 onward.\n- Starting from \\(y=0\\) at turn 18, the player can reach \\(y=6\\) by turn 24 with all \"U\" actions.\n- At \\(y=6\\), the player must stay for two turns (turns 24 and 25) to avoid moving to \\(y=7\\) during unsafe turns. Then, at turn 26, move to \\(y=7\\) (reached at turn 27).\n- From \\(y=7\\), move to \\(y=8\\) at turn 27 (reached at turn 28), and then to \\(y=9\\) at turn 28 (reached at turn 29).\n- This sequence requires 11 actions (turns 18 to 28) to reach \\(y=9\\) at turn 29.\n\n### Sequence of Actions\nThe sequence of actions minimizes the number of turns (\\(H = 11\\)) and avoids all collisions:\n- At turn 18: Move up to \\(y=1\\) (safe, as freeway 1 is unsafe only later).\n- At turn 19: Move up to \\(y=2\\) (safe, as freeway 2 is unsafe only later).\n- At turn 20: Move up to \\(y=3\\) (safe, as freeway 3 is unsafe only at turns 18-20, but turn 20 is the last unsafe turn; moving to \\(y=3\\) at turn 21 is safe).\n- At turn 21: Move up to \\(y=4\\) (safe, as freeway 4 is unsafe only before turn 21).\n- At turn 22: Move up to \\(y=5\\) (safe, as freeway 5 is unsafe only before turn 21).\n- At turn 23: Move up to \\(y=6\\) (safe, as freeway 6 is unsafe only at turn 20).\n- At turn 24: Stay at \\(y=6\\) (safe, to avoid moving to \\(y=7\\) at turn 25, which would be unsafe).\n- At turn 25: Stay at \\(y=6\\) (safe, to avoid moving to \\(y=7\\) at turn 26, which would be unsafe).\n- At turn 26: Move up to \\(y=7\\) (reached at turn 27, safe as freeway 7 is unsafe only before turn 27).\n- At turn 27: Move up to \\(y=8\\) (safe, as freeway 8 is unsafe only at turns 30-32).\n- At turn 28: Move up to \\(y=9\\) (reached at turn 29; \\(y=9\\) is always safe).\n\nThis sequence ensures the player is never on an unsafe freeway at an unsafe turn, and \\(y=9\\) is reached at turn 29 with \\(H = 11\\) actions.\n\n### Output\n\\boxed{\nTurn 18: U \\\\\nTurn 19: U \\\\\nTurn 20: U \\\\\nTurn 21: U \\\\\nTurn 22: U \\\\\nTurn 23: U \\\\\nTurn 24: S \\\\\nTurn 25: S \\\\\nTurn 26: U \\\\\nTurn 27: U \\\\\nTurn 28: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 21, and the player is at (0,3). The goal is to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on the freeways (y=1 to 8).\n\nImportant: \n- The player moves vertically: U (up: y+1), D (down: y-1), S (stay: y same). The y-coordinate is bounded between 0 and 9.\n- Collision occurs at turn T if the player is on freeway k (i.e., y_T = k) and at that turn T, the car on freeway k has its span covering 0 (the player's x-coordinate is always 0).\n\nNote: When moving from y_T to y_{T+1} at turn T, note that:\n  - At the moment of turn T, the player is still on freeway y_T (the starting freeway of the move) and will be on freeway y_{T+1} starting at the next turn (T+1). Therefore, the player only checks the freeway they are on at the beginning of the turn (i.e., y_T) for collision at turn T.\n\nCar movement:\n- Left-moving: the car moves left, so its entire span shifts left by s per turn. Given as (h, τ) at t1, then at T: [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]\n- Right-moving: the car moves right, so [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)] (note: the head and tail are given with h being the front? But in the update for right: they say from [τ, h] to [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]. However, in the input, for right-moving cars, the head is the leading edge? \n\nBut note the input for right-moving: \n  Example: (head, tail, direction, speed)\n  For a right-moving car, the head is the rightmost? Then when moving right, the head increases. So at time t1, the car is from τ to h (with τ < h). Then at time T, it becomes [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n\nSimilarly, for left: head is the leftmost? Then the car is from h to τ (which would be h < τ? but note they give negative numbers). Actually, they give the head and tail without specifying which is left/right? But the update rule uses the direction.\n\nHow to interpret the car span:\n  For a right-moving car: the car is given as (h, τ, right, s). Then the span at t1 is [min(h,τ), max(h,τ)]? But the update rule says: \n      Initially: [τ, h] -> then becomes [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n  This implies that for a right-moving car, the head h is the rightmost and tail τ is the leftmost? So the span at t1 is [τ, h] (with τ <= h).\n\nBut in the example input, we see:\n  For freeway 3: (60,49,right,4) -> then at t1, the car is from 49 to 60? So τ=49, h=60? Then the span at t1 is [49,60]. Then at turn T, it becomes [49+4*(T-21), 60+4*(T-21)].\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving: \n  Input: (-60,-25,left,36) -> head=-60, tail=-25? Then according to the update: \n      Initially: [h, τ] = [-60, -25] -> becomes [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)] = [-60 -36*(T-21), -25-36*(T-21)]\n\nBut note: the collision condition is that at turn T, the player is on freeway k and the car on that freeway has 0 in its span.\n\nSo for each freeway (1 to 8) and for each car on that freeway, we can compute the span at any turn T (>=t1) and check if 0 is in that span.\n\nWe need to move from y=3 to y=9. The minimal number of moves without any obstacles would be 6 moves (all U). However, we must avoid being on a freeway k at a turn T when a car on freeway k covers 0 at that turn.\n\nWe are to output the sequence of actions starting at turn t1 (21) until we reach y=9.\n\nPlan:\n- We can use BFS (breadth-first search) over the state (turn, y) to find the minimal H. But note: the state space in time might be large? However, the car movements are linear and periodic? But the speeds are given and the initial positions are integers, and the time steps are integers. Also, the player moves only 1 step per turn. We can simulate turn by turn.\n\nBut note: the problem asks for minimal H (number of turns). So we want the shortest path in terms of turns.\n\nWe can simulate from turn t1=21 onwards, keeping track of the current turn and the current y. The actions are U, D, S.\n\nConstraints:\n  - y must be in [0,9]. So if at y=0, we cannot go down; at y=9, we have reached the goal.\n\nGoal: reach y=9 at any turn (as soon as possible).\n\nWe must avoid, at each turn T (>=21), if we are at y=k (for k in 1..8) then we must check all cars on freeway k at turn T: if any car's span at turn T contains 0, then we cannot be at that (T, k).\n\nNote: at turn T, we are at y_T. The action we take at turn T will determine y_{T+1}. But at turn T, we are still at y_T.\n\nSo the collision check at turn T is based on the freeway we are on at the beginning of the turn (y_T) and the cars on that freeway.\n\nWe are given the state at turn t1=21.\n\nWe need to compute for each freeway and each car, the span at any turn T.\n\nLet's define:\n  T0 = 21\n\nFor a car on freeway k at turn T (>=21):\n  If direction is right: \n      span = [τ + s*(T-21), h + s*(T-21)]\n  If direction is left:\n      span = [h - s*(T-21), τ - s*(T-21)]\n\nBut note: the input gives (head, tail, direction, speed). How to interpret head and tail?\n\nThe update rules are:\n  Right: initially [τ, h] -> becomes [τ + s*(T-21), h + s*(T-21)]\n  Left: initially [h, τ] -> becomes [h - s*(T-21), τ - s*(T-21)]\n\nSo for right, the initial span is [τ, h] (with τ <= h) and for left, the initial span is [h, τ] (with h <= τ? but note the example: (-60,-25,left,36): here h=-60, τ=-25, and h<τ, so [h,τ] = [-60,-25] which is correct.\n\nTherefore, we can use:\n\n  For a right car: initial (τ, h) = (tail, head) and the tail is the leftmost, head the rightmost? But the input is given as (head, tail). In the example: (60,49,right,4) -> so head=60, tail=49? Then we take τ=49, h=60? So the span is [49,60]. Then at turn T: [49+4*(T-21), 60+4*(T-21)].\n\nSimilarly, left: (-60,-25,left,36) -> head=-60, tail=-25? Then the span is [-60, -25] (because h=-60, τ=-25, and h<τ? Actually, no: the update says for left: initially [h, τ] and then subtracts. So [h, τ] = [-60, -25] is correct.\n\nBut note: the input for freeway 3: (60,49,right,4) and (12,1,right,4). So we have two cars on freeway 3.\n\nWe must check for each car on the freeway at turn T: if 0 is in [a, b] for that car.\n\nApproach:\n\nWe'll simulate from turn 21 onward. We start at y=3 at turn 21.\n\nWe'll consider the state (turn, y). The turn starts at 21 and increases. We want to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nWe can do BFS by the number of turns (which is the same as the turn index since we start at 21). We'll generate (turn, y) states and check for collisions and boundaries.\n\nBut note: we can also move down or stay, so we might have cycles? But we want minimal turns, so we avoid going back unnecessarily. However, sometimes we might have to wait. But we can use Dijkstra in terms of number of turns (which is the same as the turn index, so we can do BFS by time).\n\nBut note: the state space is small: y in [0,9] and time we are interested in is from 21 to ... until we reach 9. How far? The minimal steps without obstacles is 6, but with obstacles we might need to wait a few turns. The cars move at speeds 4 and 36. The 36 is very fast.\n\nWe'll simulate turn by turn. We'll maintain the current turn and current y.\n\nFor each state (turn, y), we consider the next actions (U, D, S) to get to (turn+1, y') where:\n  if U: y' = min(9, y+1)\n  if D: y' = max(0, y-1)\n  if S: y' = y\n\nBut note: at the current turn (say T), we are at y. We take an action and then at turn T+1 we are at y'. However, we must check collision at turn T: if y is between 1 and 8, then we check the cars on freeway y at turn T. If there is any car that has a span containing 0, then we cannot be at (T, y) -> so we skip that state.\n\nAlso, at the next state (T+1, y'), we will check at turn T+1 if y' is in 1..8 then check the cars on freeway y' at turn T+1.\n\nWe start at turn 21, y=3. Then we check: at turn 21, freeway 3: are there any car that covers 0?\n\nWe need to compute for each freeway and each car the span at turn 21? Actually, the state given is at turn 21.\n\nLet me compute for freeway 3 at turn 21:\n\n  Cars: (60,49,right,4) and (12,1,right,4)\n\n  For (60,49,right,4): \n      initial at turn21: [49, 60] -> so 0 is not in [49,60] -> safe.\n\n  For (12,1,right,4): \n      initial: [1,12] -> 0 not in [1,12] -> safe.\n\nSo at turn21, y=3 is safe.\n\nThen we can take an action at turn21.\n\nWe want to minimize the number of turns, so we prefer moving up.\n\nBut we must plan the entire sequence.\n\nWe can do BFS:\n\n  Let Q be a queue: (turn, y, path_actions) \n  We start: (21, 3, [])\n\n  Then we expand: at a state (T, y), if we haven't reached y=9, we try actions U, D, S (if applicable) to get to next y' at turn T+1.\n\n  But note: we must check the current state (T, y) for collision: if y is between 1 and 8, then we check the cars on freeway y at turn T. If there is a car that has 0 in its span at turn T, then we cannot use this state.\n\n  However, we are generating states as we go. So when we are at (T,y), we assume we have survived until turn T-1? Actually, we check the state (T,y) at the moment we are considering it.\n\n  But note: the start state (21,3) is safe as we computed.\n\n  Then we generate next states for turn 22.\n\n  We mark visited states? But note: we might come back to the same y at a later turn and that might be necessary (if we wait). However, we are looking for minimal turns. So if we are at the same y at a later turn, that would take more turns? So we can use the fact that we are doing BFS by time: the first time we reach y=9 we have the minimal turns.\n\n  However, we can also get to y=9 by different paths and different times. We want the minimal H (number of turns from t1). So the total turns from 21 is H.\n\n  We can do BFS by the number of steps (i.e., H). We start at step0: turn21, then step1: turn22, etc.\n\n  We'll use a visited array per (turn, y) but the turn can go arbitrarily high? However, we can set a bound. The minimal without obstacles is 6, but with obstacles we might need to wait. How long? The cars are moving at speeds 4 and 36. The periods? The cars on a freeway might have a period relative to their speed? Since the road is infinite, the pattern of when a car covers 0 is periodic. But the periods might be fractional? Actually, the speeds are integers, so the car positions are linear.\n\n  However, we can note that the minimal time to wait might be bounded. For example, if a car is moving at speed 4, then the time between consecutive coverings of 0 is the length of the car divided by the speed? Actually, no: the car is a segment. For a car of length L, it covers 0 for one time unit? Actually, the car moves continuously? But the update is discrete per turn. \n\n  Actually, the car's span at turn T is a contiguous interval. The car will cover 0 for exactly one turn? Not necessarily: if the car is long, it might cover 0 for several consecutive turns? \n\n  Example: a car moving right: at turn T, the span is [a, b]. Then 0 is in [a, b] if a<=0<=b.\n\n  The next time it covers 0: the car moves by s per turn. So the time it takes to move the entire length is (b - a) / s? Then the next time it covers 0 is when the car has moved so that the head (or tail) passes 0. Actually, the car covers 0 for a contiguous block of time? The number of consecutive turns that 0 is covered is the length of the car divided by the speed? Actually, no: the car moves s units per turn. So if the car is of length L, then the time that 0 is covered is ceil(L / s)? Actually, the time that 0 is inside the car is the time from when the tail passes 0 to when the head passes 0? That is (L) / s? Since the car moves s per turn, the time is (L) / s? But if L is not divisible by s, then it would be floor(L/s) or ceil(L/s)? Actually, it is exactly L/s? But we are in discrete time.\n\n  However, we don't need to worry about the period. We can simulate until we find a path. We can set a limit on the total turns, say up to 21+20 = 41? because minimal is 6, so 20 extra turns should be enough.\n\n  Alternatively, we can compute for each freeway and for each car the set of turns T>=21 such that 0 is in the car's span. Then we can avoid being on that freeway at those turns.\n\n  But we have multiple cars per freeway? Then we must avoid being on the freeway at any turn T that has at least one car covering 0.\n\n  So for each freeway k, we can precompute the set of turns T (>=21) at which the freeway k is blocked (i.e., at least one car on k has 0 in its span).\n\n  How to compute for one car?\n\n  Example: right-moving car: (τ, h, right, s) -> at turn T: [τ + s*(T-21), h + s*(T-21)]\n  Condition: τ + s*(T-21) <= 0 <= h + s*(T-21)\n\n  => \n      T >= ceil( ( -τ ) / s ) + 21   [if s>0] \n      T <= floor( ( -h ) / s ) + 21   -> wait, let's solve:\n\n      τ + s*(T-21) <= 0  => T-21 >= ceil( (-τ) / s )? Actually:\n\n      We have:\n        τ + s*(T-21) <= 0   => T-21 >= ceil( (-τ) / s )? But note: if (-τ) is positive? \n\n      Actually, τ is the tail (left end) and h is the head (right end). For a right-moving car, the car moves to the right. So the condition for 0 to be in the car is:\n\n        τ + s*(T-21) <= 0 <= h + s*(T-21)\n\n      => \n        T-21 >= ceil( (-τ) / s )   [if s>0]  -> but note: (-τ) might be negative? \n\n      Let me rearrange:\n\n        τ + s*(T-21) <= 0   => s*(T-21) <= -τ   => T-21 <= floor(-τ / s)   -> wait, no:\n\n        If s>0, then: \n          T-21 >= ceil( (-τ) / s )   [if (-τ)/s is fractional, we need T-21 to be at least the next integer]? Actually:\n\n          τ + s*(T-21) <= 0  => T-21 <= (-τ) / s   -> but note: if τ is negative, then -τ is positive.\n\n      Actually, τ is the left end. For the example (60,49,right,4): τ=49? Then -τ=-49 -> then we have 49 + 4*(T-21) <=0 -> 4*(T-21)<=-49 -> T-21 <= -12.25 -> which is impossible. So this car never covers 0? \n\n      How about (12,1,right,4): τ=1? Then 1+4*(T-21)<=0 -> 4*(T-21)<=-1 -> T-21<= -0.25 -> impossible.\n\n      So freeway 3 at turn21 and beyond: no car covers 0? \n\n      But wait, we have freeway 6: (-60,-25,left,36) -> left moving: \n          [h - 36*(T-21), τ - 36*(T-21)] = [-60 -36*(T-21), -25-36*(T-21)]\n          Condition: -60 -36*(T-21) <= 0 <= -25-36*(T-21)\n\n          First inequality: -60 -36*(T-21) <=0 -> -36*(T-21) <=60 -> (T-21) >= ceil(-60/36) = ceil(-5/3) = ceil(-1.666) = -1 -> always true for T>=21? \n\n          Second inequality: 0 <= -25 -36*(T-21) -> 36*(T-21) <= -25 -> T-21 <= -25/36 -> T-21 <= -0.69 -> which is impossible.\n\n      So this car never covers 0? \n\n      Then freeway 6 is always safe?\n\n      But wait, freeway 7: \n          (60,49,right,4): same as freeway3 -> never covers 0.\n          (24,13,right,4): \n               τ=13, h=24? Then condition: 13+4*(T-21)<=0<=24+4*(T-21)\n               First: 13+4*(T-21)<=0 -> 4*(T-21)<=-13 -> T-21<=-13/4=-3.25 -> impossible.\n          (-12,-23,right,4): note, this is right-moving? But head=-12, tail=-23? Then the span at t1 is [τ, h] = [-23,-12]. Then condition: -23+4*(T-21)<=0<=-12+4*(T-21)\n               First: -23+4*(T-21)<=0 -> 4*(T-21)<=23 -> T-21<=23/4=5.75 -> T<=26.75 -> so T from 21 to 26?\n               Second: 0<=-12+4*(T-21) -> 12<=4*(T-21) -> 3<=T-21 -> T>=24.\n\n          So together: T>=24 and T<=26 (because T must be integer: 24,25,26).\n\n          Therefore, freeway 7 is blocked at turns 24,25,26.\n\n      Similarly, freeway 1: (-36,-47,right,4): \n          τ=-47, h=-36 -> span at t1: [-47,-36]. Then condition: -47+4*(T-21)<=0<=-36+4*(T-21)\n          First: -47+4*(T-21)<=0 -> 4*(T-21)<=47 -> T-21<=47/4=11.75 -> T<=32.75 -> T from 21 to 32.\n          Second: 0<=-36+4*(T-21) -> 36<=4*(T-21) -> 9<=T-21 -> T>=30.\n\n          So freeway 1 is blocked at T=30,31,32.\n\n      Similarly, freeway 2: same as freeway1: blocked at T=30,31,32.\n\n      Freeway 4: same as freeway3? we have (60,49,right,4) and (12,1,right,4): both never cover 0? \n          For (12,1,right,4): τ=1 -> 1+4*(T-21)<=0 -> T-21<=-0.25 -> impossible.\n\n      Freeway 5: same as freeway3 -> safe.\n\n      Freeway 8: same as freeway1 -> blocked at T=30,31,32.\n\n      Freeway 3: safe? \n          (60,49,right,4): τ=49 -> 49+4*(T-21)<=0 -> impossible.\n          (12,1,right,4): τ=1 -> impossible.\n\n      Freeway 4: same as 3 -> safe.\n\n      Freeway 5: same -> safe.\n\n      Freeway 6: we have one left-moving car: (-60,-25,left,36) -> \n          Condition: -60-36*(T-21) <= 0 <= -25-36*(T-21)\n          First: -60-36*(T-21)<=0 -> -36*(T-21)<=60 -> multiply by -1 (reverse inequality): 36*(T-21)>=-60 -> T-21>=-60/36 = -5/3 -> which is always true for T>=21.\n          Second: 0<=-25-36*(T-21) -> 36*(T-21)<=-25 -> T-21<=-25/36 -> T-21<=-0.69 -> impossible.\n\n      So freeway 6 is always safe.\n\n      Freeway 7: we found blocked at T=24,25,26.\n\n      Freeways 1,2,8: blocked at T=30,31,32.\n\n      Freeways 3,4,5,6: always safe? \n\nBut wait, freeway 7 has three cars? We checked two: (60,49) and (24,13) are safe? and (-12,-23) blocks at 24,25,26.\n\nSo summary of blocked freeways:\n\n  Freeway 1: T in {30,31,32}\n  Freeway 2: T in {30,31,32}\n  Freeway 7: T in {24,25,26}\n  Freeway 8: T in {30,31,32}\n\nThe others (3,4,5,6) are always safe.\n\nTherefore, we can only be on freeways 1,2,7,8 at turns that are not in their blocked sets.\n\nNow, we want to go from y=3 (at turn21) to y=9 (which is above freeway8, so safe).\n\nWe are at turn21, y=3 (freeway3 is safe at turn21).\n\nWe need to move up: 3->4->5->6->7->8->9.\n\nBut note: we cannot be on freeway7 at turns 24,25,26 and on freeway8 at 30,31,32? But we are starting at turn21, so we can plan.\n\nMinimal steps: 6 moves (all U) would get to y=9 at turn27? \n  Turn21: y=3 -> safe (freeway3 safe)\n  Turn22: move U -> y=4 -> at turn22: freeway4 is safe? (yes, because freeway4 is always safe) -> safe.\n  Turn23: move U -> y=5 -> safe.\n  Turn24: move U -> y=6 -> safe (freeway6 safe).\n  Turn25: move U -> y=7 -> but freeway7 at turn25 is blocked! -> collision.\n\nSo we cannot go through freeway7 at turn25.\n\nWe can try to delay: at turn24, we are at y=6 (safe). Then at turn24 we could stay or go down? But going down would be moving away. Alternatively, we can wait at y=6 for a few turns until freeway7 is safe again.\n\nFreeway7 is blocked at turns 24,25,26 -> so at turn27, freeway7 is safe? \n\nAt turn27: freeway7: \n  The car (-12,-23,right,4): \n      At turn27: [τ + 4*(27-21), h + 4*(27-21)] = [-23+4*6, -12+4*6] = [-23+24, -12+24] = [1,12] -> 0 not in [1,12] -> safe.\n\nSo at turn27, freeway7 is safe.\n\nThen we can:\n\n  Turn21: y=3 -> safe.\n  Turn22: U -> y=4 -> safe.\n  Turn23: U -> y=5 -> safe.\n  Turn24: U -> y=6 -> safe (freeway6 safe).\n  Turn25: S (stay at y=6) -> safe.\n  Turn26: S (stay at y=6) -> safe.\n  Turn27: U -> y=7 -> safe (freeway7 now safe).\n  Turn28: U -> y=8 -> but freeway8: at turn28, is it blocked? Blocked at 30,31,32 -> so turn28 is safe? \n      Freeway8: we have one car: (-36,-47,right,4)\n          At turn28: [τ +4*(28-21), h+4*(28-21)] = [-47+28, -36+28] = [-19,-8] -> 0 not in [-19,-8] -> safe.\n  Turn29: U -> y=9 -> goal.\n\nTotal turns: from turn21 to turn29 -> that's 9 turns? But we count the actions: \n  We start at turn21: we take actions at turn21,22,...,28 (8 actions) and then at turn29 we are at y=9 -> so H=8? \n\nBut note: the problem says: the sequence of actions from t1 to t1+H-1, and then at the end of the sequence we have y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nIn our plan:\n\n  Turn21: action -> then at turn22 we are at y=4.\n  ...\n  Turn28: action U -> then at turn29 we are at y=9.\n\nSo the last action is at turn28, and we are at y=9 at turn29.\n\nBut the problem: we start at turn21 at y=3. Then we take H actions: at turns 21,22,...,21+H-1. Then at turn21+H we are at the next state.\n\nWe require that at turn21+H, we are at (0,9). \n\nIn our plan, we have:\n\n  Turn21: action1 (U) -> then at turn22: y=4\n  Turn22: action2 (U) -> turn23: y=5\n  Turn23: action3 (U) -> turn24: y=6\n  Turn24: action4 (S) -> turn25: y=6\n  Turn25: action5 (S) -> turn26: y=6\n  Turn26: action6 (U) -> turn27: y=7\n  Turn27: action7 (U) -> turn28: y=8\n  Turn28: action8 (U) -> turn29: y=9\n\nSo H=8? Then we take actions from turn21 to turn21+7 (i.e., turn28). And at turn21+8 = 29, we are at (0,9).\n\nBut the problem says: the sequence of actions is for t from t1 to t1+H-1, so H=8 actions.\n\nIs there a faster way? \n\nWe could avoid freeway7 entirely? But we have to go through freeway7 to get to 8 and 9.\n\nAlternatively, we could go up to 8 earlier? But freeway8 is blocked at 30,31,32, and we are at turn24,25,26,27,28,29 -> so freeway8 is safe at turn28 and turn29.\n\nBut we cannot get to freeway8 without going through freeway7.\n\nWhat if we go faster? \n\n  Turn21: U -> y=4\n  Turn22: U -> y=5\n  Turn23: U -> y=6\n  Turn24: U -> y=7 -> but turn24: freeway7 blocked -> collision.\n\nSo we must avoid freeway7 at turn24.\n\nWe could go slower? \n\n  Turn21: S -> stay at y=3 (safe) \n  Turn22: U -> y=4\n  Turn23: U -> y=5\n  Turn24: U -> y=6\n  Turn25: U -> y=7 -> blocked at turn25 -> collision.\n\nSame problem.\n\nWe could go down? \n\n  But going down would be counterproductive.\n\nSo the only option is to wait at y=6 for two turns (turn24 and turn25) and then at turn26 we go to y=7? But freeway7 is blocked at turn26? \n\nAt turn26: freeway7: \n  The car (-12,-23,right,4): \n      [τ +4*(26-21), h+4*(26-21)] = [-23+20, -12+20] = [-3,8] -> 0 is in [-3,8]? Yes, because -3<=0<=8 -> blocked.\n\nSo we cannot be at y=7 at turn26.\n\nBut at turn27: as we computed, it becomes [1,12] -> safe.\n\nTherefore, we must wait until turn26 to leave y=6? But we can leave at turn26 to go to y=7? No, because at turn26 we are at y=6 (so we are safe) and then we take an action at turn26 to go to y=7: that means at turn26 we are still at y=6 (so safe) and then at turn27 we are at y=7? \n\nBut note: when we are at turn26, we are at y=6. Then we take an action (U) at turn26: so during turn26 we are at y=6 (safe) and then we move to y=7 at the end of turn26 (so for the next turn, turn27, we start at y=7). \n\nTherefore, we are on freeway7 at turn27? \n\nAnd at turn27, we check freeway7: safe as computed.\n\nSo the plan:\n\n  Turn21: U -> y=4 (at turn22)\n  Turn22: U -> y=5 (turn23)\n  Turn23: U -> y=6 (turn24)\n  Turn24: S -> y=6 (turn25)   [we are at y=6 at turn24: safe; and at turn25 we are still at y=6: safe]\n  Turn25: S -> y=6 (turn26)   [safe]\n  Turn26: U -> y=7 (turn27)   [at turn26: we are at y=6 -> safe; then move to y=7 at turn27]\n  Turn27: U -> y=8 (turn28)   [at turn27: y=7 -> check: freeway7 at turn27: safe; then move to y=8 at turn28]\n  Turn28: U -> y=9 (turn29)   [at turn28: y=8 -> check freeway8 at turn28: we computed [-19,-8] -> safe; then move to y=9 at turn29]\n\nSo we have 8 actions.\n\nBut is there a way with 7 actions? \n\nWe start at y=3 at turn21. Then 7 actions: we would be at turn28 at y=?\n\nWe need to get from y=3 to y=9: 6 steps up. So we must have at least 6 U's. The 7th action could be a S? Then we have 6 U and 1 S: total 7 actions? Then we would be at y=9 at turn28? \n\nBut let's try:\n\n  We must use 6 U and 1 S? The S can be inserted anywhere. We have to avoid being at freeway7 at turns 24,25,26.\n\n  Possibilities:\n\n  Option1: \n      Turn21: U -> y=4 (turn22)\n      Turn22: U -> y=5 (23)\n      Turn23: S -> y=5 (24)   [at turn24: we are at y=5 -> safe? freeway5 is always safe -> safe]\n      Turn24: U -> y=6 (25)   [at turn25: y=6 -> safe]\n      Turn25: U -> y=7 (26)   [at turn26: y=7 -> blocked (freeway7 at turn26: [-3,8] -> 0 in it -> collision]\n\n  Option2:\n      Turn21: S -> y=3 (22)\n      Turn22: U -> y=4 (23)\n      Turn23: U -> y=5 (24)\n      Turn24: U -> y=6 (25)\n      Turn25: U -> y=7 (26) -> blocked at turn26.\n\n  Option3:\n      Turn21: U -> y=4 (22)\n      Turn22: U -> y=5 (23)\n      Turn23: U -> y=6 (24)\n      Turn24: U -> y=7 (25) -> blocked at turn25.\n\n  Option4: \n      Turn21: U -> y=4 (22)\n      Turn22: U -> y=5 (23)\n      Turn23: U -> y=6 (24)\n      Turn24: S -> y=6 (25)\n      Turn25: U -> y=7 (26) -> blocked at turn26.\n\n  Option5: \n      Turn21: U -> y=4 (22)\n      Turn22: U -> y=5 (23)\n      Turn23: U -> y=6 (24)\n      Turn24: U -> y=7 (25) -> blocked.\n\n  Option6: use a D? \n      But that would require extra U to compensate, so we would need more than 7 actions.\n\nTherefore, 7 actions are not enough.\n\nSo minimal H=8.\n\nThe sequence:\n\n  Turn21: U\n  Turn22: U\n  Turn23: U\n  Turn24: S\n  Turn25: S\n  Turn26: U\n  Turn27: U\n  Turn28: U\n\nBut note: at turn28 we do U to get to y=9 at turn29.\n\nBut the last action is at turn28 (the 8th action) and then we are at y=9 at turn29.\n\nNow, we must write the actions for turns 21 to 28.\n\nBut note: the problem says: the sequence of actions for t from t1 to t1+H-1, so H=8: from turn21 to turn21+7=28.\n\nSo:\n\n  Turn 21: U\n  Turn 22: U\n  Turn 23: U\n  Turn 24: S\n  Turn 25: S\n  Turn 26: U\n  Turn 27: U\n  Turn 28: U\n\nBut let me verify the positions and collisions:\n\n  Turn21: at (0,3) -> action U -> then at turn22: y=4.\n      Collision check at turn21: freeway3 -> safe.\n\n  Turn22: at (0,4) -> action U -> then at turn23: y=5.\n      Check turn22: freeway4 -> safe.\n\n  Turn23: at (0,5) -> action U -> then at turn24: y=6.\n      Check turn23: freeway5 -> safe.\n\n  Turn24: at (0,6) -> action S -> then at turn25: y=6.\n      Check turn24: freeway6 -> safe.\n\n  Turn25: at (0,6) -> action S -> then at turn26: y=6.\n      Check turn25: freeway6 -> safe.\n\n  Turn26: at (0,6) -> action U -> then at turn27: y=7.\n      Check turn26: freeway6 -> safe.\n\n  Turn27: at (0,7) -> action U -> then at turn28: y=8.\n      Check turn27: freeway7 -> \n          Cars: \n            (60,49,right,4): [49+4*(27-21)=49+24=73, 60+24=84] -> no 0.\n            (24,13,right,4): [13+24=37, 24+24=48] -> no.\n            (-12,-23,right,4): [-23+4*6=-23+24=1, -12+24=12] -> 0 not in [1,12] -> safe.\n\n  Turn28: at (0,8) -> action U -> then at turn29: y=9.\n      Check turn28: freeway8 -> \n          Car: (-36,-47,right,4): [-47+4*(28-21)= -47+28=-19, -36+28=-8] -> 0 not in [-19,-8] -> safe.\n\nThen at turn29, we are at y=9 -> goal.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 8.\n\nBut note: we must output the sequence for turns 21 to 28.\n\nAnswer:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 21: U\nTurn 22: U\nTurn 23: U\nTurn 24: S\nTurn 25: S\nTurn 26: U\nTurn 27: U\nTurn 28: U\n}\n\nBut wait: the problem says the initial position is (0, y_{t1}) at turn t1 (21). Then we take action a_{t1} at turn t1. Then we take a_{t1+1} at turn t1+1, etc.\n\nSo the sequence above is correct.\n\nIs there a sequence with 8 actions that avoids the two S? Maybe by taking a detour? \n\nBut we have to go from 3 to 9: that requires 6 U's. The other two actions must be non-down? We used S. Could we use extra U's and then D? But that would require more steps? \n\nAlternatively, we could go to y=7 at a safe time and then wait at y=7? But we cannot be at y=7 until turn27. Then:\n\n  Turn21: U -> y=4\n  Turn22: U -> y=5\n  Turn23: U -> y=6\n  Turn24: U -> y=7 -> blocked at turn24? -> no, because we cannot go to y=7 at turn24.\n\nBut if we wait at y=5? \n\n  Turn21: U -> y=4\n  Turn22: U -> y=5\n  Turn23: S -> y=5\n  Turn24: U -> y=6\n  Turn25: S -> y=6\n  Turn26: U -> y=7 -> at turn26: we are at y=6 (safe) then move to y=7 at turn27 -> safe at turn27? \n  Then turn27: U -> y=8\n  Turn28: U -> y=9 -> same as before, but we used two S and 6 U -> 8 actions.\n\nSame length.\n\nAlternatively, we might avoid freeway7 by going to freeway8 earlier? But we cannot jump over freeway7.\n\nTherefore, the above sequence is minimal.\n\nBut note: we have freeways 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. The player must be on one of these when moving. There is no horizontal movement.\n\nSo we are confident.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 21: U\nTurn 22: U\nTurn 23: U\nTurn 24: S\nTurn 25: S\nTurn 26: U\nTurn 27: U\nTurn 28: U\n}\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 3) on turn 21 and aims to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y = 1 to 8.\n\n### Analysis:\n- **Initial Position**: (0, 3) at turn 21 (freeway 3 is safe at turn 21).\n- **Goal**: Reach y = 9 as quickly as possible.\n- **Car Blocking Analysis**:\n  - Freeway 7 is blocked at turns 24, 25, 26 due to a car spanning [1, 12] at turn 27 being safe.\n  - Freeway 8 is blocked at turns 30, 31, 32 but safe at turn 28.\n  - Freeways 3, 4, 5, 6 are always safe.\n- **Minimal Path**:\n  - Direct upward movement (all U) would collide on freeway 7 at turn 25.\n  - To avoid, wait at y = 6 (freeway 6, safe) for turns 24 and 25.\n  - Proceed upward starting at turn 26: reach y = 7 at turn 27 (freeway 7 now safe), y = 8 at turn 28 (freeway 8 safe), and y = 9 at turn 29.\n- **Total Turns**: 8 actions (from turn 21 to turn 28) to reach y = 9 at turn 29.\n\n### Action Sequence:\n- **Turn 21 (y=3)**: Move up to y=4 (safe, freeway 3 safe at turn 21).\n- **Turn 22 (y=4)**: Move up to y=5 (safe, freeway 4 always safe).\n- **Turn 23 (y=5)**: Move up to y=6 (safe, freeway 5 always safe).\n- **Turn 24 (y=6)**: Stay at y=6 (safe, freeway 6 always safe; avoids freeway 7 at turn 24).\n- **Turn 25 (y=6)**: Stay at y=6 (safe, freeway 6 always safe; avoids freeway 7 at turn 25).\n- **Turn 26 (y=6)**: Move up to y=7 (safe at turn 27; freeway 6 safe at turn 26).\n- **Turn 27 (y=7)**: Move up to y=8 (safe, freeway 7 safe at turn 27: car spans [1,12], 0 not in span).\n- **Turn 28 (y=8)**: Move up to y=9 (safe, freeway 8 safe at turn 28: car span [-19, -8], 0 not in span).\n\nAt turn 29, the player reaches (0, 9).

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get the player from (0,0) at turn 24 to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The player moves up, down, or stays, changing y by +1, -1, or 0 each turn. Cars move left or right at constant speeds, and I collide if I'm on a freeway where a car spans x=0 at that turn.\n\nFirst, I should figure out where the cars are at each turn starting from t=24. The car positions are given at t=24, and they move linearly with their speeds.\n\nLet me list out the cars for each freeway:\n\n- Freeway 1: one car, head -48, tail -59, right, speed 4. Since it's moving right, at time T, span is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] with t1=24.\n\nThe update rule:\n\nFor right-moving: Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nSince head and tail, I think head is the front, so for right-moving, if it's moving right, the head should be the right end, I think? Let me read carefully.\n\nIt says: for right-moving, Span(t1) = [τ, h] and Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nIn the table, for freeway 1: (-48, -59, right, 4). So head h = -48, tail τ = -59? But for right-moving, if it's moving right, the head should be the leading end, so if it's moving right, head should be larger x, but here h=-48, τ=-59, so -48 > -59, so head is at -48, tail at -59, so since it's moving right, head increases.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, head decreases.\n\nIn freeway 6, (48,83,left,36), head=48, tail=83? 48<83, so if left-moving, head should be decreasing, so head at 48, tail at 83? That doesn't make sense because if head is 48 and tail is 83, and moving left, tail should be behind, so if moving left, the head is smaller x, tail larger x.\n\nI think I need to interpret the head and tail.\n\nFrom the update:\n\nFor left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nSo for left-moving, at t1, the span is from h to τ, with h and τ, and since it's moving left, h decreases, τ decreases.\n\nIn the car state, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nFor left-moving, head h is the left end? Let's see an example.\n\nIn freeway 3: (48,37,right,4) and (0,-11,right,4)\n\nFor right-moving, direction right, so head should be the right end, so for (48,37,right,4), head=48, tail=37, so at t1, span [τ, h] = [37,48]? But it says Span(t1) = [τ, h] for right-moving.\n\nIn the table, it says \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nAnd for right-moving, Span(t1) = [τ, h] → [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT]\n\nFor (48,37,right,4), if head h=48, tail τ=37, then Span(t1) = [τ, h] = [37,48], which is from 37 to 48, and since moving right, it increases.\n\nSimilarly, for (0,-11,right,4), τ=-11, h=0, so span [-11,0] at t1.\n\nNow for left-moving, like freeway 6: (48,83,left,36)\n\nFor left-moving, Span(t1) = [h, τ] → [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT]\n\nHere h=48, τ=83, so [48,83] at t1, moving left, so both decrease.\n\nOkay, so in general, head is the leading end, tail is the trailing end based on direction.\n\nFor right-moving, head is right end, tail is left end.\n\nFor left-moving, head is left end, tail is right end.\n\nIn terms of position, for right-moving, head > tail, for left-moving, head < tail.\n\nIn freeway 6, head=48, tail=83, 48<83, so head left, tail right, moving left.\n\nNow, collision occurs at turn T only if the player is on that freeway at turn T, and for that freeway, 0 is within the span of some car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nImportant note: when you move, at turn T, you are on y_T, and you decide action to go to y_{T+1}, but at turn T, you are on y_T, so you collide if on freeway k=y_T and 0 in span of car on k at T.\n\nAlso, when you move to y_{T+1} at turn T+1, you are not on y_{T+1} at turn T, so you don't care about cars on y_{T+1} at turn T, only at the turn you are on that row.\n\nNow, the player starts at y=0 at t=24, and needs to reach y=9. y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, freeways are y=1 to 8, so only when on y=1 to 8, we need to avoid cars.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nPlayer position: (0, y_t), with y vertical, from 0 to 9.\n\nAt turn t, player is at (0, y_t), and we need y_{t1+H-1} =9.\n\nActions at each turn affect next position.\n\nLet t be the turn index.\n\nAt turn t, player is at y_t, chooses action a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, with Δy based on a_t.\n\nThen at turn t+1, position is y_{t+1}, and so on.\n\nWe start at t=24, y_{24} =0.\n\nWe need to find H and actions a_{24} to a_{24+H-2} such that after H-1 actions, at turn 24+H-1, y_{24+H-1} =9.\n\nLet me define the sequence.\n\nSet t_start = 24.\n\nAt turn t, for t from t_start to t_start + H -1, but positions: at turn t_start, position y_t_start =0.\n\nAfter action a_t_start, at turn t_start+1, position y_{t_start+1} = y_t_start + Δy.\n\n...\n\nAfter action a_{t_start + H-2}, at turn t_start + H-1, position y_{t_start + H-1}.\n\nWe want this to be 9.\n\nThe number of actions is H-1, from t=24 to t=24 + H -2, and at turn 24+H-1, position is 9.\n\nMinimal H means minimal number of turns from start to end, so H is the number of turns including start and end.\n\nFrom turn t_start to t_start + H -1, that's H turns.\n\nAt turn t_start, position given.\n\nAfter H-1 actions, at turn t_start + H -1, position should be 9.\n\nSo H is the total turns from start to finish.\n\nTo minimize H, we want to reach y=9 as fast as possible, so probably moving up as much as possible, but avoiding cars on the freeways.\n\nSince we start at y=0, and need to go to y=9, the minimal moves without cars would be 9 moves up, so H=10 turns: start at t=24 y=0, after 9 up moves, at t=33 y=9.\n\nBut with cars, we might need to wait or detour, so H could be larger.\n\nBut since we can only move one step per turn, and cars move, we need to find when it's safe to be on each row.\n\nFirst, I need to model the car positions over time.\n\nLet t1 = 24.\n\nFor each freeway k, and each car on it, I can find when x=0 is covered by the car at turn T.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if player is on row k and 0 is in the span of some car on row k at T.\n\nFor a car, at turn T, the span is as above.\n\nFor simplicity, let ΔT = T - t1, with t1=24.\n\nSo for a car, at time T, span depends on ΔT.\n\nNow, for each row, I need to find the times when it is unsafe, i.e., when some car covers x=0.\n\nThen, to be safe at row k at turn T, we need that at that turn, for row k, no car covers x=0.\n\nIf multiple cars, we need that for all cars on that row, 0 not in span.\n\nNow, let's list all rows and their cars.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (-48, -59, right, 4)\n\nRight-moving, so span at T: [τ + 4ΔT, h + 4ΔT] = [-59 + 4ΔT, -48 + 4ΔT]\n\nSet 0 in this interval: -59 + 4ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ -48 + 4ΔT\n\nSo -59 + 4ΔT ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ -48 + 4ΔT\n\nFirst inequality: -59 + 4ΔT ≤ 0 => 4ΔT ≤ 59 => ΔT ≤ 59/4 = 14.75, so ΔT ≤ 14 since integer? ΔT is integer, T turn, so ΔT integer.\n\nTurns are discrete, so ΔT = T - t1, integer.\n\nSimilarly, all positions, but spans are real? The update has s(T-t1), which could be fractional if s not integer, but in this case speeds are integers, so positions integer? Head and tail given integers, speed integer, so positions integer at all turns.\n\ns=4 or 36, integers, so positions integer.\n\nSo ΔT integer.\n\nFor freeway 1 car: 0 in [-59 +4ΔT, -48 +4ΔT] if -59 +4ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ -48 +4ΔT\n\nSo 0 ≤ -48 +4ΔT => 4ΔT ≥ 48 => ΔT ≥ 12\n\nAnd -59 +4ΔT ≤ 0 => 4ΔT ≤ 59 => ΔT ≤ 14.75, so ΔT ≤ 14 since integer.\n\nSo ΔT from 12 to 14 inclusive.\n\nΔT ≥12 and ΔT ≤14, so ΔT=12,13,14.\n\nThus at ΔT=12,13,14, i.e., T=24+12=36, T=37, T=38, the car covers x=0 on freeway 1.\n\nT= t1 + ΔT = 24 + ΔT.\n\nSo for freeway 1, unsafe when T=36,37,38.\n\nNow, freeway 2: same as freeway 1, (-48,-59,right,4), so same, unsafe T=36,37,38.\n\nNow freeway 3: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (48,37,right,4) head=48, tail=37, right-moving.\n\nSpan at T: [τ +4ΔT, h+4ΔT] = [37 +4ΔT, 48 +4ΔT]\n\n0 in this? 37+4ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ 48+4ΔT? But 37+4ΔT ≥37>0 for ΔT≥0, so 0 ≤ 37+4ΔT always true? No.\n\n0 in [low, high] if low ≤ 0 ≤ high.\n\nHere low = 37+4ΔT, which since ΔT≥0, low ≥37>0, so 0 < low, so 0 not in [low,high] because low >0.\n\nSimilarly, high=48+4ΔT>0, so since low >0, 0 not in interval.\n\nSo this car never covers x=0, because it starts at x=37 to 48, moving right, always positive x.\n\nSecond car on freeway 3: (0,-11,right,4) head=0, tail=-11, right-moving.\n\nSpan at T: [τ +4ΔT, h+4ΔT] = [-11 +4ΔT, 0 +4ΔT] = [-11+4ΔT, 4ΔT]\n\n0 in this? -11+4ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ 4ΔT\n\nFirst, 0 ≤ 4ΔT always for ΔT≥0.\n\nSecond, -11+4ΔT ≤ 0 => 4ΔT ≤11 => ΔT ≤ 11/4=2.75, so ΔT ≤2.\n\nAlso, since ΔT≥0, so for ΔT=0,1,2.\n\nAt ΔT=0, T=24, span [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nΔT=1, T=25, span [-11+4, 4] = [-7,4], 0 in.\n\nΔT=2, T=26, span [-11+8,8]=[-3,8], 0 in.\n\nΔT=3, T=27, span [-11+12,12]=[1,12], 0 not <=1? 0 <1, not >=1, so 0 not in [1,12].\n\nSimilarly higher.\n\nSo unsafe for ΔT=0,1,2, i.e., T=24,25,26.\n\nNow, for freeway 3, both cars: first car never unsafe, second unsafe at T=24,25,26.\n\nSo freeway 3 unsafe at T=24,25,26.\n\nT=24 is current turn, but at T=24, we are at y=0, not on freeway 3, so we don't care about collision at T=24 for row 3, only if we are on row at that turn.\n\nBut for future, freeway 3 unsafe at T=25,26? T=24,25,26.\n\nT=24 is now, but we start at y=0, so for T=24, we are on row 0, not on freeway, so for row 3, unsafe at T=25 and 26.\n\nT=25 and 26.\n\nNow freeway 4: same as freeway 3? Cars: (48,37,right,4) and (0,-11,right,4), same as row 3.\n\nIn table: freeway 4: (48,37,right,4), (0,-11,right,4), same as row 3.\n\nSo unsafe at T=25,26? T=24,25,26 but T=24 not relevant if not on row.\n\nUnsafe when T=25 and 26 for row 4.\n\nSimilarly freeway 5: same, (48,37,right,4), (0,-11,right,4), so unsafe T=25,26.\n\nNow freeway 6: one car (48,83,left,36)\n\nLeft-moving, head=48, tail=83, so at t1, span [h, τ] = [48,83]\n\nThen at T, span [h - s ΔT, τ - s ΔT] = [48 - 36 ΔT, 83 - 36 ΔT]\n\n0 in this? 48 - 36 ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ 83 - 36 ΔT\n\nFirst, 0 ≤ 83 - 36 ΔT => 36 ΔT ≤ 83 => ΔT ≤ 83/36 ≈ 2.305, so ΔT ≤ 2\n\nSecond, 48 - 36 ΔT ≤ 0 => 48 ≤ 36 ΔT => ΔT ≥ 48/36 = 4/3 ≈1.333, so ΔT ≥ 2? Since integer.\n\nΔT ≥ ceil(4/3) = 2? 36 ΔT ≥ 48, ΔT ≥ 48/36 = 4/3 ≈1.333, so ΔT ≥ 2 since integer.\n\nΔT min: 48 - 36 ΔT ≤ 0 => 48 ≤ 36 ΔT => ΔT ≥ 48/36 = 4/3, so since ΔT integer, ΔT ≥ 2.\n\nΔT max: 0 ≤ 83 - 36 ΔT => 36 ΔT ≤ 83 => ΔT ≤ 83/36 ≈2.305, so ΔT ≤ 2.\n\nThus ΔT=2 only.\n\nAt ΔT=2, T=26, span [48-72, 83-72] = [-24,11], so -24 to 11, 0 in it.\n\nAt ΔT=1, T=25, span [48-36,83-36]=[12,47], 12>0, 0 not in.\n\nΔT=0, T=24, [48,83], 48>0, 0 not in.\n\nΔT=3, T=27, [48-108,83-108]=[-60,-25], negative, 0 not in.\n\nSo only at T=26, freeway 6 unsafe.\n\nNow freeway 7: three cars.\n\nFirst car: (48,37,right,4), same as before, never covers 0, as min x=37>0.\n\nSecond car: (12,1,right,4) head=12, tail=1, right-moving.\n\nSpan [τ +4ΔT, h+4ΔT] = [1+4ΔT, 12+4ΔT]\n\n0 in this? 1+4ΔT ≤0? But 1+4ΔT ≥1>0 for ΔT≥0, so low>0, 0 not in.\n\nThird car: (-24,-35,right,4) head=-24? tail=-35, right-moving.\n\nSpan [τ +4ΔT, h+4ΔT] = [-35 +4ΔT, -24 +4ΔT]\n\n0 in this if -35 +4ΔT ≤0 ≤ -24 +4ΔT\n\nSo -35 +4ΔT ≤0 => 4ΔT ≤35 => ΔT ≤ 35/4=8.75, ΔT≤8\n\nAnd 0 ≤ -24 +4ΔT => 4ΔT ≥24 => ΔT ≥6\n\nSo ΔT from 6 to 8 inclusive, T=24+6=30 to 32.\n\nT=30,31,32.\n\nNow, for freeway 7, first car never unsafe, second car never unsafe, third car unsafe at T=30,31,32.\n\nSo row 7 unsafe at T=30,31,32.\n\nFinally freeway 8: (-48,-59,right,4) same as row 1 and 2, unsafe at T=36,37,38.\n\nNow, row 1,2,8 all have same car, unsafe T=36,37,38.\n\nRow 3,4,5 unsafe at T=25,26.\n\nRow 6 unsafe only at T=26.\n\nRow 7 unsafe at T=30,31,32.\n\nNow, row 3,4,5 also unsafe at T=25,26, but T=25 and 26.\n\nT=24 is current, we are at y=0.\n\nWe need to go from y=0 to y=9, passing through y=1 to 8.\n\nEach move, we can go up, down, or stay.\n\nTo minimize time, we want to go up as much as possible, but avoid being on a row when it is unsafe.\n\nWe start at t=24, y=0.\n\nAt turn t, we are at y_t, and we choose action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nThen at turn t+1, we are at y_{t+1}, and so on.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at some turn.\n\nSince we start at y=0 and end at y=9, and must go through each row, the minimal number of moves is 9, if we go up every time.\n\nBut with obstacles, we might need to wait or go down sometimes.\n\nFirst, let's see the unsafe times for each row.\n\nList for each row the turns when it is unsafe:\n\n- Row 1: unsafe at T=36,37,38\n\n- Row 2: same, 36,37,38\n\n- Row 3: unsafe at T=25,26\n\n- Row 4: same, 25,26\n\n- Row 5: same, 25,26\n\n- Row 6: unsafe only at T=26\n\n- Row 7: unsafe at T=30,31,32\n\n- Row 8: unsafe at T=36,37,38\n\nNow, row 3,4,5 all unsafe at T=25 and 26.\n\nRow 6 unsafe only at T=26.\n\nRow 7 unsafe T=30,31,32.\n\nRows 1,2,8 unsafe late at 36-38.\n\nWe need to go from y=0 to y=9.\n\nThe critical part is around rows 3-6 and row 7.\n\nSince we start at t=24, y=0.\n\nWe need to move to y=1, but at which turn?\n\nAt turn t, when we are on row k, it must be safe, i.e., not unsafe at that turn.\n\nNow, to minimize time, we should move up as soon as possible.\n\nBut we might need to delay or hurry to avoid unsafe times.\n\nFirst, let's consider moving up continuously.\n\nIf we go up every turn:\n\nStart t=24, y=0\n\nAfter a_{24}, at t=25, y=1\n\nAt t=25, y=1, row 1 is safe? Row 1 unsafe only at 36-38, so at t=25, row 1 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, row 2 at t=26, y=2, safe.\n\nAt t=25, y=1, row 1.\n\nRow 1 unsafe at 36,37,38, not at 25, so safe.\n\nThen a_{25}=U, at t=26, y=2, row 2, safe.\n\na_{26}=U, at t=27, y=3, row 3.\n\nBut row 3 unsafe at T=25 and 26, but T=27 is later, so at T=27, row 3 should be safe.\n\nRow 3 unsafe only at 25 and 26, so at t=27, it is safe.\n\nSimilarly, at t=27, y=3, row 3 safe.\n\nThen a_{27}=U, t=28, y=4, row 4.\n\nRow 4 unsafe at 25,26, t=28>26, safe.\n\na_{28}=U, t=29, y=5, row 5, safe similarly.\n\na_{29}=U, t=30, y=6, row 6.\n\nRow 6 unsafe only at t=26, t=30>26, so safe.\n\nBut row 7 is unsafe at t=30,31,32.\n\nAt t=30, y=6, row 6, which is safe.\n\nThen a_{30}=U, to y=7 at t=31.\n\nAt t=31, y=7, row 7.\n\nBut row 7 is unsafe at t=30,31,32.\n\nSo at t=31, row 7 unsafe, collision if we are on it.\n\nProblem.\n\nIn this sequence, at t=31, we are on row 7, which is unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, if we go to row 7 at t=30 or 32, also unsafe.\n\nNow, at t=30, we are at y=6, row 6, safe.\n\nThen if we go up, at t=31 y=7 row 7 unsafe.\n\nIf we stay, at t=31 y=6 row 6, which is safe since only unsafe at t=26.\n\nThen at t=31, if we stay, y=6, safe.\n\nThen at t=32, if we go up, y=7, row 7 unsafe at t=32.\n\nStill unsafe.\n\nWe need to avoid being on row 7 at t=30,31,32.\n\nSo we must be on row 7 outside these times.\n\nSimilarly, for other rows.\n\nNow, row 7 unsafe only at t=30,31,32, so we can be on row 7 before or after.\n\nFor example, at t=29, if we are on row 7, but row 7 unsafe starts at t=30, so t=29 should be safe.\n\nSimilarly, t=33 and later safe.\n\nNow, in the direct path, we arrive at row 6 at t=30, which is safe, but then we need to go to row 7, which is unsafe at t=31,32.\n\nSo we might need to wait at row 6 until t=33, then go up.\n\nBut let's see the timing.\n\nStart t=24 y=0\n\nWe can go up at t=24 to y=1 at t=25.\n\nAt t=25 y=1, safe.\n\nGo up to y=2 at t=26, safe.\n\nGo up to y=3 at t=27, safe (since row 3 unsafe only 25,26)\n\nt=27>26, safe.\n\nGo up to y=4 at t=28, safe.\n\nGo up to y=5 at t=29, safe.\n\nNow at t=29 y=5, row 5 safe.\n\nNow we need to go to y=6.\n\nIf we go up at t=29, to y=6 at t=30.\n\nAt t=30 y=6, row 6 safe.\n\nBut then from here, if we go up to y=7 at t=31, row 7 unsafe.\n\nIf we stay at y=6, at t=31 y=6, safe, but then at t=32, if go up, y=7 at t=32, row 7 unsafe.\n\nIf we stay again, t=32 y=6, safe, then at t=33, go up to y=7 at t=33.\n\nAt t=33, row 7: unsafe at 30,31,32, so t=33>32, safe.\n\nThen we can go up to y=8 at t=34, row 8.\n\nRow 8 unsafe at 36,37,38, t=34<36, safe.\n\nThen to y=9 at t=35.\n\nBut y=9 is not freeway, safe.\n\nNow, let's list the turns:\n\nt=24: y=0, action a_{24}, to y=1 at t=25\n\nt=25: y=1, action U, to y=2 at t=26\n\nt=26: y=2, action U, to y=3 at t=27\n\nt=27: y=3, action U, to y=4 at t=28\n\nt=28: y=4, action U, to y=5 at t=29\n\nt=29: y=5, action U, to y=6 at t=30\n\nt=30: y=6, now we stay? Action S, so y=6 at t=31\n\nt=31: y=6, action S, to y=6 at t=32? Action S, y stays same.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t, action a_t determines y_{t+1}.\n\nSo at t=30, y=6, we choose a_{30}=S, then y_{31}=6\n\nAt t=31, y=6, we choose a_{31}=S, then y_{32}=6\n\nAt t=32, y=6, we choose a_{32}=U, then y_{33}=7\n\nAt t=33, y=7, action U, to y=8 at t=34\n\nAt t=34, y=8, action U, to y=9 at t=35\n\nNow, at t=35, y=9, which is the goal.\n\nWe started at t=24 y=0, ended at t=35 y=9.\n\nNumber of turns: from t=24 to t=35, that's 12 turns? Turns: 24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35. That's 12 positions, but H is the number of turns including start and end, so from turn 24 to turn 35, that's 12 turns.\n\nH = number of turns from start to finish, so if start at t, end at t+H-1, so here t=24, end at 35, so 35 = 24 + H -1, so 35-24+1=12, H=12.\n\nBut minimal without obstacles is 10 turns: t=24 to t=33, for example, but with cars, we took 12.\n\nBut we have to avoid row 7 during 30-32.\n\nIn this sequence, we stayed at y=6 for two extra turns.\n\nBut is there a faster way?\n\nPerhaps we can go faster at the beginning or end.\n\nFor example, if we can reach row 7 before t=30 or after t=32.\n\nIn the above, we arrived at row 6 at t=30.\n\nWe could arrive earlier.\n\nStart at t=24 y=0.\n\nInstead of going up every turn, we might go slower at first to delay.\n\nBut since rows 1-5 are safe except row 3-5 at t=25,26, but we are not on them at that time.\n\nIn direct path, we are on row 1 at t=25, row 2 at t=26, both safe since unsafe late.\n\nRow 3 at t=27, safe.\n\nBut row 3 is unsafe at t=25,26, but at t=27 we are on it, safe.\n\nNow, to reach row 6 earlier.\n\nFor example, if we go up faster, but we can only move one per turn.\n\nFrom y=0 at t=24, to y=1 at t=25, y=2 at t=26, ..., y=6 at t=30, as before.\n\nWe cannot reach y=6 before t=30 because it takes 6 moves: from y=0 to y=6, need 6 steps, so at turn t=24+6=30, y=6.\n\nSimilarly, minimal to y=6 is t=30.\n\nThen from there, if we go directly to y=7 at t=31, unsafe.\n\nWe have to wait until t=33 to be on y=7.\n\nBut at t=33, we can be on y=7.\n\nThen to y=8 at t=34, y=9 at t=35.\n\nBut y=8 at t=34, row 8 is safe since unsafe at 36-38, t=34<36.\n\nNow, what about row 6? We were at row 6 from t=30 to t=32 in the waiting, but row 6 is only unsafe at t=26, so t=30,31,32 are all safe for row 6.\n\nSimilarly, row 5 at t=29, safe.\n\nBut we have an issue with rows 3,4,5 at t=25,26, but in our path, we were on row 3 at t=27, which is after, safe.\n\nBut what if we are on row 3,4, or 5 at t=25 or 26? We might be able to, but in minimal path, we are not.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps we can go to row 7 before t=30.\n\nFor example, if we can be on row 7 at t=29.\n\nt=29: to be on row 7 at turn t=29, we need to have moved to y=7 by t=29.\n\nStart t=24 y=0.\n\nAfter 5 moves, at t=29, y=5 if all up, but we need y=7.\n\nTo reach y=7 at t=29, that means at turn t=29, position y=7.\n\nSo we started at t=24 y=0, after 5 actions, y_{29} =7.\n\nSince each move changes y by at most 1, to go from 0 to 7 in 5 moves, we need net +7, but with 5 moves, max increase 5, so y=5 at t=29, cannot be y=7.\n\nImpossible to be at y=7 before t=31 with minimal moves.\n\nFrom t=24 y=0:\n\nAfter k actions, at turn t=24+k, position y <= k.\n\nTo be at y=7 at turn T, we need T >= 24+7 =31, since at least 7 moves.\n\ny=0 at t=24, after first action at t=24, to y=1 at t=25.\n\nAt turn t, y_t, after actions.\n\nAt turn t=24, y=0.\n\nAfter a_{24}, at t=25, y= y_{24} + Δy =0 or 1, etc.\n\nTo have y_t =7, since start at y=0, t=24, we need at least 7 up moves, so the earliest t for y=7 is t=24 +7 =31, with all up moves.\n\nSimilarly, y=6 at earliest t=30.\n\ny=7 at t=31 at earliest.\n\nBut at t=31, row 7 is unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, we cannot be on row 7 before t=31.\n\nThe only possibility is to be on row 7 after t=32, so at t=33 or later.\n\nIn the sequence I had, we go to row 7 at t=33.\n\nThen to y=8 at t=34, y=9 at t=35.\n\nNow, what about row 8? At t=34, y=8, row 8 unsafe at 36,37,38, so t=34<36, safe.\n\nThen to y=9 at t=35.\n\nBut we have rows 1,2,8 unsafe late, but we are not on them at that time.\n\nIn this path, we are on row 8 at t=34, safe.\n\nBut can we reach earlier?\n\nPerhaps we can slow down at the beginning to avoid something, but I don't see why.\n\nAnother thing: row 6 is unsafe only at t=26, which is early, and we are on it later, fine.\n\nBut in the waiting at row 6, we spent two extra turns.\n\nPerhaps we can be at a different row during the unsafe period.\n\nFor example, during t=30-32, instead of staying at row 6, we could go down to row 5 or something, but that might not help.\n\nSuppose at t=30, we are at y=6, but instead of staying, we go down to y=5 at t=31.\n\nAt t=31, y=5, row 5.\n\nRow 5 is unsafe only at t=25,26, so t=31 safe.\n\nThen at t=32, we could go up to y=6, row 6 safe.\n\nThen at t=33, go up to y=7, row 7 safe at t=33.\n\nThen same as before, to y=8 at t=34, y=9 at t=35.\n\nBut we used an extra move: from y=6 down to y=5, then up to y=6, then up to y=7, so we have an extra down and up, which takes more turns, worse than staying at y=6.\n\nIn the stay case, we stayed at y=6 for two turns, so we have two S actions.\n\nIn this down-up, we have D then U, which also takes two actions to stay at same y effectively, but we moved down and up, so y changed, but we end up at y=6 at t=32 instead of staying.\n\nIn terms of progress, no better.\n\nAnd we might have been on row 5 at t=31, but row 5 is safe, no issue.\n\nBut it doesn't save time.\n\nWe still reach y=7 at t=33.\n\nSo no benefit.\n\nPerhaps we can reach higher rows earlier, but impossible due to movement constraint.\n\nAnother idea: what about row 3,4,5 unsafe at t=25,26.\n\nIn our path, we are on row 3 at t=27, after the unsafe period.\n\nBut if we could be on row 3 earlier, but at t=25, if we are on row 3, it is unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, at t=26.\n\nBut to be on row 3 at t=25, we need to have moved faster.\n\nStart at t=24 y=0.\n\nAfter one action, at t=25, y=1 if U, or 0 if S or D.\n\nCannot be y=3 at t=25, impossible.\n\nSimilarly, minimal to row 3 is at t=27 with y=3.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nThus, the sequence I have seems necessary.\n\nBut let's confirm the actions.\n\nStart: turn t=24, position y=0, we choose action a_{24}=U, so at t=25, y=1.\n\nt=25, y=1, action U, to y=2 at t=26.\n\nt=26, y=2, action U, to y=3 at t=27.\n\nt=27, y=3, action U, to y=4 at t=28.\n\nt=28, y=4, action U, to y=5 at t=29.\n\nt=29, y=5, action U, to y=6 at t=30.\n\nt=30, y=6, action S, to y=6 at t=31. (stay)\n\nt=31, y=6, action S, to y=6 at t=32. (stay again)\n\nt=32, y=6, action U, to y=7 at t=33.\n\nt=33, y=7, action U, to y=8 at t=34.\n\nt=34, y=8, action U, to y=9 at t=35.\n\nNow at t=35, y=9, done.\n\nTotal turns from t=24 to t=35: 12 turns.\n\nBut is there a way with fewer?\n\nPerhaps we can go to row 7 later but start later or something, but we need to reach y=9.\n\nAnother point: at the end, rows 1,2,8 unsafe at t=36-38, but we are at y=9 at t=35, before that, so fine.\n\nBut we have to go through row 8.\n\nIn the sequence, at t=34, we are on row 8, which is safe.\n\nIf we could reach y=9 earlier, but with waiting, we cannot.\n\nPerhaps during the waiting, we can do something else, but no.\n\nAnother thought: row 6 is unsafe only at t=26, but we are on it at t=30, which is fine.\n\nBut what if we can be on row 7 at t=33 directly without waiting, but we have to come from row 6.\n\nUnless we skip row 6 or something, but we must pass through each row, I think? No, we can move vertically, but we have to go from 0 to 9, so we must pass through each integer y, but we can stay or move, but eventually we need to be on each row between, but not necessarily, for example, we could go from y=5 to y=7 directly? No, because we can only change by 1 each turn, so we must pass through each intermediate y.\n\nYes, since Δy = -1,0,1, so to go from y to y+2, we need at least two turns, passing through y+1.\n\nSimilarly, we must visit each integer y between start and end if we go directly, but we can go down, so we might skip some, but in this case, since we start at 0 and end at 9, and minimal path, we don't go down unnecessarily, so we should visit each row once.\n\nIn this case, with obstacles, we might detour, but going down would take more time, so not helpful.\n\nFor example, if we go down to y=0 or something, but that wastes time.\n\nSo the sequence above should be minimal.\n\nBut let's see if we can reduce the waiting.\n\nWe need to avoid row 7 at t=31 and t=32, but since we can only be on row 7 at t=31 at earliest, we must delay until t=33.\n\nThe waiting is necessary.\n\nPerhaps we can arrive at row 6 later, but that would make us later overall.\n\nFor example, if we stay at y=5 longer.\n\nAt t=29, y=5, instead of going up, we stay.\n\nThen at t=30, y=5, safe.\n\nThen at t=30, go up to y=6 at t=31.\n\nAt t=31, y=6, safe.\n\nThen at t=31, go up to y=7? But at t=32, y=7, row 7 unsafe at t=32.\n\nStill problem.\n\nIf we stay at y=6 at t=31, then at t=32, y=6, then go up at t=32 to y=7 at t=33, same as before.\n\nBut we started later from y=5.\n\nIn this case: suppose at t=29, y=5, we choose S, so at t=30, y=5.\n\nThen at t=30, y=5, action U, to y=6 at t=31.\n\nt=31, y=6, action U, to y=7 at t=32.\n\nBut at t=32, y=7, row 7 unsafe.\n\nCollision.\n\nIf at t=31, y=6, we choose S, to y=6 at t=32.\n\nThen at t=32, y=6, action U, to y=7 at t=33.\n\nThen same as before.\n\nBut we were at y=5 at t=30, instead of y=6, so we lost one turn.\n\nThen we reach y=9 later.\n\nFor example: t=24: y=0, a=U, t=25 y=1\n\nt=25: y=1, a=U, t=26 y=2\n\nt=26: y=2, a=U, t=27 y=3\n\nt=27: y=3, a=U, t=28 y=4\n\nt=28: y=4, a=U, t=29 y=5\n\nt=29: y=5, a=S, t=30 y=5  (stay)\n\nt=30: y=5, a=U, t=31 y=6\n\nt=31: y=6, a=S, t=32 y=6  (stay, but we could go U, but unsafe)\n\nt=32: y=6, a=U, t=33 y=7\n\nt=33: y=7, a=U, t=34 y=8\n\nt=34: y=8, a=U, t=35 y=9\n\nSame as before, but we have an extra stay at y=5, so ended at t=35 still? t=35 y=9.\n\nBut in this, at t=30 y=5, whereas in first sequence, at t=30 y=6, so we are one behind.\n\nIn first sequence, at t=30 y=6, then two stays, to t=32 y=6, then up to t=33 y=7, t=34 y=8, t=35 y=9.\n\nIn this, at t=30 y=5, then to y=6 at t=31, then to y=6 at t=32 (if stay), then y=7 at t=33, etc., same end.\n\nBut if at t=31 we go directly to y=7, unsafe.\n\nSo no gain.\n\nThus, minimal is to go up directly to y=6 by t=30, wait at y=6 for two turns (t=31 and t=32), then proceed to y=9 by t=35.\n\nH=12 turns.\n\nBut let's confirm the actions for the answer.\n\nWe need to output the actions from turn t=24 onwards.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nAt turn t=24: action a_{24} = U\n\nt=25: action U\n\nt=26: action U\n\nt=27: action U\n\nt=28: action U\n\nt=29: action U\n\nt=30: action S (stay)\n\nt=31: action S (stay)\n\nt=32: action U\n\nt=33: action U\n\nt=34: action U\n\nThen at t=35, y=9, done.\n\nThe last action is at t=34, to go to y=9 at t=35.\n\nWe need to reach at turn t=24+H-1=35, so H-1=11, H=12.\n\nThe sequence of actions is for t from t=24 to t=24 + H - 2 = 24 to 34? Let's see.\n\nThe actions: we have actions from t=24 to t=34, that's 11 actions, for 11 steps? Positions from t=24 to t=35, 12 positions, 11 actions.\n\nIn general, from start turn to end turn, with H turns, there are H-1 actions.\n\nStart at turn S, end at turn E, with E = S + H - 1.\n\nActions from turn S to S + H - 2.\n\nHere S=24, E=35, so H = E - S + 1 = 12.\n\nActions at turns: 24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34. That's 11 actions.\n\nIn the sequence above, actions at t=24 to t=34.\n\nt=24: U\n\nt=25: U\n\nt=26: U\n\nt=27: U\n\nt=28: U\n\nt=29: U\n\nt=30: S\n\nt=31: S\n\nt=32: U\n\nt=33: U\n\nt=34: U\n\nThen at t=35, y=9.\n\nIn the output format, it should be:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1}\n\n...\n\nUp to the last action.\n\nt_1 = 24.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 24: U\n\nTurn 25: U\n\nTurn 26: U\n\nTurn 27: U\n\nTurn 28: U\n\nTurn 29: U\n\nTurn 30: S\n\nTurn 31: S\n\nTurn 32: U\n\nTurn 33: U\n\nTurn 34: U\n\nBut after a_{34}=U, at t=35 y=9.\n\nIs there a way with H=11? That would be end at t=34.\n\nt=24 to t=34, 11 turns.\n\ny from 0 to 9, need at least 9 moves, so possible in 10 turns? Turns: t=24 to t=33, 10 turns, y=0 to y=9 with 9 up moves.\n\nBut with obstacles, not possible.\n\nAt t=34, to be at y=9, we need to have started from y=8 at t=33.\n\nBut row 8 at t=33: unsafe at 36-38, so t=33 safe.\n\nBut to be at y=8 at t=33, need to come from y=7 at t=32 or something.\n\nBut row 7 at t=32 unsafe.\n\nConflict.\n\nSpecifically: to reach y=9 at t=34, we need y_{34}=9.\n\nThen at t=34, position y=9, no action needed, but the last action is at t=33 to go to y=9.\n\ny_{34} = y_{33} + Δy_{33}\n\nSet y_{34}=9.\n\ny_{33} must be 8 or 9 or 10, but y<=9, so y_{33}=8 or 9.\n\nIf y_{33}=9, then a_{33}=S or D, but we can stay or move down, but to end at 9, if already at 9, we can stay, but we need to reach 9, so if at y_{33}=9, we can have a_{33}=S.\n\nBut if y_{33}=8, then a_{33}=U to y=9.\n\nNow, at t=33, if we are on row, y_{33} must be safe.\n\nSimilarly, to be at y_{33}=9 or 8.\n\nBut row 7 is unsafe at t=30,31,32, so at t=33 safe.\n\nBut let's see if we can reach earlier.\n\nSuppose we want y_{34}=9.\n\nThen we need to be at y_{33} such that after action, y_{34}=9.\n\nNow, minimal to reach high y fast.\n\nBut we are blocked by row 7 at t=31 and t=32.\n\nFor example, at t=32, we cannot be on row 7, since unsafe.\n\nBut to be at y=8 at t=33, for example.\n\ny_{33}=8.\n\nThen at t=33, we are on row 8, which is safe at t=33.\n\nThen a_{33}=U to y=9 at t=34.\n\nNow, how to reach y=8 at t=33.\n\ny=8 at t=33.\n\nStart from y=0 at t=24, need to increase by 8 in 9 turns? From t=24 to t=33, that's 10 turns? Turns: t=24 to t=33, 10 positions, 9 actions.\n\ny from 0 to 8 in 9 actions, but with moves, can be done with 8 up and one stay or something, but minimal 8 up moves.\n\nEarliest y=8 at t=32? Let's see.\n\nAt t=24, y=0\n\nAfter a_{24}, t=25, y<=1\n\n...\n\nAfter k actions, at turn t=24+k, y <= k.\n\nTo have y=8 at t=33, t=33 = 24 + 9, so after 9 actions, y <=9, but y=8 possible with some down or stay.\n\nBut to reach y=8 at t=33, we need at least 8 up moves, so possible.\n\nBut we need to pass through row 7.\n\nAt turn t=32, to reach y=8 at t=33, we must be at y=7 or y=8 or y=9 at t=32.\n\nIf at t=32, y=7, but row 7 unsafe at t=32.\n\nIf at t=32, y=8, then row 8 at t=32: row 8 unsafe at 36-38, t=32<36, safe.\n\nThen at t=32, y=8, we can choose a_{32}=S to stay at y=8 for t=33, or U to y=9, but to reach y=9 at t=34, we can go later.\n\nBut we want y_{34}=9, so if at t=32 y=8, a_{32}=U, then y_{33}=9, then at t=33 y=9, we can have a_{33}=S or whatever, but y=9 reached at t=33.\n\nBut we need to reach at t=34? Let's not confuse.\n\nIf we can reach y=9 at t=33, that would be better.\n\nt=33 y=9.\n\nThen H=10 turns: t=24 to t=33.\n\nBut to have y_{33}=9.\n\nThen at t=33, position y=9.\n\nNow, to be there, we need to have come from y=8 at t=32 with U, or from y=9 with S, etc.\n\nBut at t=32, if y=8, row 8 safe.\n\nIf y=9, no row.\n\nBut we need to be on row 7 at some point.\n\nNow, to reach y=8 at t=32.\n\ny=8 at t=32.\n\nt=32 = 24 + 8, so after 8 actions, y <=8.\n\nCan be y=8 with all up moves except possible.\n\nBut to be at y=8 at t=32, we need 8 up moves in 8 actions.\n\nActions from t=24 to t=31 determine y at t=32.\n\ny_{32} = y_{31} + Δy_{31}\n\nBut y_{31} depends on previous.\n\nWith all up, from t=24: a_{24}=U, t=25 y=1\n\na_{25}=U, t=26 y=2\n\n...\n\na_{30}=U, t=31 y=6? Let's compute:\n\nt=24: y=0\n\na_{24}=U: t=25 y=1\n\na_{25}=U: t=26 y=2\n\na_{26}=U: t=27 y=3\n\na_{27}=U: t=28 y=4\n\na_{28}=U: t=29 y=5\n\na_{29}=U: t=30 y=6\n\na_{30}=U: t=31 y=7\n\nAt t=31 y=7, but row 7 unsafe at t=31, collision.\n\nIf we do not go up at some point, but to reach y=8 at t=32, we need y_{31}=7 or 8 or 9.\n\nIf y_{31}=7, then a_{31}=U to y=8 at t=32.\n\nBut at t=31, if y=7, row 7 unsafe.\n\nIf y_{31}=8, then a_{31}=S to y=8 at t=32, or U to y=9, etc.\n\nBut y_{31}=8 at t=31.\n\nt=31 = 24 +7, after 7 actions, y<=7, so y=8 impossible at t=31.\n\nMax y at t=31 is 7, with all up.\n\nSimilarly, min y=0, etc.\n\nSo at t=31, y<=7.\n\nThus to have y=8 at t=32, we must have y_{31}=7 and a_{31}=U, so that y_{32}=8.\n\nBut at t=31, y=7, row 7 unsafe, collision.\n\nTherefore, impossible to be at y=8 at t=32 without being on row 7 at t=31.\n\nSimilarly, if we want y=9 at t=33, we need y_{32}=8 or 9.\n\nIf y_{32}=8, then a_{32}=U to y=9 at t=33.\n\nBut to have y_{32}=8, as above, requires being at y=7 at t=31, unsafe.\n\nIf y_{32}=9, then at t=32, y=9, which requires y_{31}=8 or 9, but y_{31}<=7, impossible.\n\nThus, the earliest we can be at y=9 is t=35, as in the first sequence.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=12.\n\nNow, in the output, we need to list the actions.\n\nIn the sequence, we have two S at t=30 and t=31.\n\nIn the action list:\n\nTurn 24: U\n\nTurn 25: U\n\nTurn 26: U\n\nTurn 27: U\n\nTurn 28: U\n\nTurn 29: U\n\nTurn 30: S\n\nTurn 31: S\n\nTurn 32: U\n\nTurn 33: U\n\nTurn 34: U\n\nAfter Turn 34 action U, at t=35 y=9.\n\nThe answer should be in the boxed format.\n\nBut in the car states, is there any other constraint?\n\nFor example, at row 6, we stayed at t=30 and t=31, but row 6 is safe, no car at that time.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nPerhaps we can have a different sequence, but I think this is minimal.\n\nSo the actions are as above.\n\nNow, to write in the format.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 0) at turn \\(t_1 = 24\\) and must reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\). Collisions occur if the player is on a freeway \\(y\\) at turn \\(T\\) and a car on that freeway spans \\(x = 0\\) at \\(T\\).\n\n### Car Positions and Unsafe Times\nThe car positions and movements are analyzed to determine when each freeway is unsafe (i.e., when a car spans \\(x = 0\\)). The unsafe times for each freeway, starting from \\(t_1 = 24\\), are:\n- **Freeway 1**: Unsafe at \\(T = 36, 37, 38\\) (due to car \\((-48, -59, \\text{right}, 4)\\))\n- **Freeway 2**: Unsafe at \\(T = 36, 37, 38\\) (due to car \\((-48, -59, \\text{right}, 4)\\))\n- **Freeway 3**: Unsafe at \\(T = 25, 26\\) (due to car \\((0, -11, \\text{right}, 4)\\); car \\((48, 37, \\text{right}, 4)\\) never unsafe)\n- **Freeway 4**: Unsafe at \\(T = 25, 26\\) (due to car \\((0, -11, \\text{right}, 4)\\); car \\((48, 37, \\text{right}, 4)\\) never unsafe)\n- **Freeway 5**: Unsafe at \\(T = 25, 26\\) (due to car \\((0, -11, \\text{right}, 4)\\); car \\((48, 37, \\text{right}, 4)\\) never unsafe)\n- **Freeway 6**: Unsafe at \\(T = 26\\) (due to car \\((48, 83, \\text{left}, 36)\\))\n- **Freeway 7**: Unsafe at \\(T = 30, 31, 32\\) (due to car \\((-24, -35, \\text{right}, 4)\\); cars \\((48, 37, \\text{right}, 4)\\) and \\((12, 1, \\text{right}, 4)\\) never unsafe)\n- **Freeway 8**: Unsafe at \\(T = 36, 37, 38\\) (due to car \\((-48, -59, \\text{right}, 4)\\))\n\n### Path to Minimize Turns\nThe minimal path to reach \\(y = 9\\) requires 12 turns (from \\(t = 24\\) to \\(t = 35\\)) due to the unsafe period on freeway 7 (\\(y = 7\\)) at \\(T = 30, 31, 32\\):\n- The player must reach \\(y = 6\\) by \\(T = 30\\), which is safe for freeway 6 (unsafe only at \\(T = 26\\)).\n- Freeway 7 is unsafe at \\(T = 30, 31, 32\\), so the player cannot be on \\(y = 7\\) during these turns. The earliest safe turn for \\(y = 7\\) is \\(T = 33\\).\n- To avoid being on \\(y = 7\\) at \\(T = 31\\) or \\(T = 32\\), the player stays at \\(y = 6\\) for turns \\(T = 31\\) and \\(T = 32\\) (actions: Stay at \\(T = 30\\) and \\(T = 31\\)).\n- After \\(T = 32\\), the player moves up to \\(y = 7\\) at \\(T = 33\\), then to \\(y = 8\\) at \\(T = 34\\), and finally to \\(y = 9\\) at \\(T = 35\\).\n\n### Action Sequence\nThe sequence of actions minimizes \\(H = 12\\) (turns \\(24\\) to \\(35\\)):\n- At turn 24: Move up to \\(y = 1\\) at \\(T = 25\\) (freeway 1 safe at \\(T = 25\\)).\n- At turn 25: Move up to \\(y = 2\\) at \\(T = 26\\) (freeway 2 safe at \\(T = 26\\)).\n- At turn 26: Move up to \\(y = 3\\) at \\(T = 27\\) (freeway 3 safe at \\(T = 27\\) since unsafe only at \\(T = 25, 26\\)).\n- At turn 27: Move up to \\(y = 4\\) at \\(T = 28\\) (freeway 4 safe at \\(T = 28\\)).\n- At turn 28: Move up to \\(y = 5\\) at \\(T = 29\\) (freeway 5 safe at \\(T = 29\\)).\n- At turn 29: Move up to \\(y = 6\\) at \\(T = 30\\) (freeway 6 safe at \\(T = 30\\)).\n- At turn 30: Stay to remain at \\(y = 6\\) for \\(T = 31\\) (freeway 6 safe at \\(T = 31\\)).\n- At turn 31: Stay to remain at \\(y = 6\\) for \\(T = 32\\) (freeway 6 safe at \\(T = 32\\)).\n- At turn 32: Move up to \\(y = 7\\) at \\(T = 33\\) (freeway 7 safe at \\(T = 33\\)).\n- At turn 33: Move up to \\(y = 8\\) at \\(T = 34\\) (freeway 8 safe at \\(T = 34\\) since unsafe only at \\(T = 36, 37, 38\\)).\n- At turn 34: Move up to \\(y = 9\\) at \\(T = 35\\).\n\nThis sequence ensures no collisions and reaches \\(y = 9\\) in the minimal turns (\\(H = 12\\)).\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 24: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 25: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 26: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 27: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 28: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 29: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 30: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 31: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 32: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 33: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 34: \\text{ U} \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>We are given the current turn t1 = 30 and the player is at (0,0). The goal is to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with any car on the freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nThe player can move up (U: +1), down (D: -1), or stay (S: 0) in the y-direction, but note that y is bounded between 0 and 9.\n\nThe cars are moving on freeways 1 to 8. Each freeway has one or more cars. Each car is defined by (head, tail, direction, speed). Note the direction: \n- Right-moving: the car moves to the right, so at time t1, the span is [tau, h] (with tau <= h) and at time T, the span becomes [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n- Left-moving: the car moves to the left, so at time t1, the span is [h, tau] (with h <= tau) and at time T, the span becomes [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)].\n\nCollision occurs at turn T only if the player is on a freeway k (meaning y_T = k) and the x-coordinate 0 is inside the span of any car on that freeway at that exact turn T.\n\nImportant note: when moving from y to y' at turn T, at the moment of the move (turn T) the player is still on row y. Then at turn T+1, the player is on row y'. So we only check the freeway of the current row at the current turn.\n\nOur plan:\n1. We need to simulate the movement of the cars for future turns. Since the cars move at integer speeds and we are only concerned with when the car spans cover x=0, we can compute for each freeway and each car the set of turns (relative to t1) at which x=0 is in the car's span.\n\n2. However, note that the cars move continuously in the sense that the span at time T is a continuous interval? Actually, the problem states the span as an interval of integers? But note the positions are integers? The problem says \"head\" and \"tail\" are integers? The update uses integer multiples. So we assume the grid is integer.\n\n3. For each freeway k, we want to know the set of turns (starting from t1) for which the freeway k is unsafe (i.e., at least one car covers x=0). Then, when the player is on freeway k at turn T (relative to t1, so absolute turn = t1 + T), we must avoid T being in the unsafe set for k.\n\n4. We are starting at y0 = 0 at time T=0 (which is absolute turn t1=30). We wish to reach y=9 as quickly as possible. We can only change by at most 1 per turn.\n\n5. We can use BFS (breadth-first search) over the state (time_index, y_position) where time_index is the number of turns elapsed (t from 0 to ...). But note that the unsafe sets are periodic? Not exactly, because the cars move at constant speed and the grid is infinite? However, note the cars are moving at constant speed and the unsafe times for a car might be periodic? Actually, for a single car, the unsafe condition is linear in time.\n\nBut note: multiple cars per freeway and they might have different speeds and starting positions.\n\nHowever, let's compute the unsafe intervals for each freeway.\n\nFirst, we define T = t - t1, so T=0 is the current turn.\n\nFor a right-moving car: \n   At T, the car spans [tau + 4*T, h + 4*T] (since speed=4). We have collision if:\n      tau + 4*T <= 0 <= h + 4*T   [because for right-moving, the span is [tau, h] at T=0? But note: the description says at t1 the car is given by (head, tail, ...). For right-moving: the car at t1 is [tau, h] meaning the tail is at tau and head at h? And then at T, it becomes [tau + s*T, h + s*T]. So the condition is:\n      tau + 4*T <= 0 <= h + 4*T\n\nSimilarly, for a left-moving car: \n   At t1, the car is [h, tau] (so head at h, tail at tau, and h<=tau) and at T, [h - 36*T, tau - 36*T]. Then collision if:\n      h - 36*T <= 0 <= tau - 36*T\n\nBut note: the problem states for left-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, tau] -> Span(T) = [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\". So at T, the span is [h - s*T, tau - s*T]. And we require:\n      h - s*T <= 0 <= tau - s*T\n\nHowever, note that the condition for the left-moving car: because h <= tau, then the interval [h - s*T, tau - s*T] is increasing? Actually, no: as T increases, the entire interval moves left. The condition for 0 to be in [h - s*T, tau - s*T] is:\n      h - s*T <= 0 <= tau - s*T\n   => 0 >= h - s*T  and 0 <= tau - s*T\n   => s*T >= h   and s*T <= tau\n   => T >= ceil(h/s) and T <= floor(tau/s)   [but note: h and tau are integers, s is integer, and T is integer? Actually, T is integer because we are at integer turns.]\n\nBut wait: the condition is for integer T (the turn count is integer). So we can compute the set of T (>=0) for which the condition holds.\n\nLet's do this for each car on each freeway.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (-48, -59, right, 4)\n   Right-moving: condition: -59 + 4*T <= 0 <= -48 + 4*T\n   => -59 + 4T <= 0 and 0 <= -48 + 4T\n   => 4T <= 59 -> T <= 59/4 = 14.75 -> T <= 14\n   and 4T >= 48 -> T >= 12\n   So T in [12,14] (since T integer)\n\nFreeway 2: same as freeway 1: (-48, -59, right, 4) -> unsafe at T in [12,14]\n\nFreeway 3: two cars:\n   Car1: (48, 37, right, 4) -> wait, note: for right-moving, the representation is (head, tail) and the span at t1 is [tau, head]? But the input gives (head, tail) and then direction. The problem says: for a right-moving car, the span at t1 is [tau, head]? But look at the example: (48,37,right,4). Then the span at t1 is [37,48]? Because it says: for right-moving: [tau, head]? Actually, the input says: (head, tail) and then direction. The problem states: \n        \"Cars (head h, tail tau, direction d, speed s)\"\n   and then for right-moving: the span at t1 is [tau, h] -> so if the car is (48,37,right,4), then at t1 the span is [37,48]. Then at time T: [37+4T, 48+4T].\n\n   Condition for car1: 37+4T <= 0 <= 48+4T -> \n        37+4T <= 0 -> T <= -37/4 -> T <= -9.25 -> but T>=0 -> no solution? \n        and 0<=48+4T -> always true for T>=0? \n        So no collision for this car?

We wish to get to y=9. The player moves at each turn by U, D, or S.\n\nWe are going to do a BFS (or Dijkstra, but since each move has cost 1 and we want minimal turns, BFS by time) over the state (T, y). We start at (0,0). We want to reach (T,9) for the smallest T.\n\nAt each state (T, y), we consider the next action: U, D, S. Then the next state is (T+1, y') where:\n   if U: y' = min(9, y+1)\n   if D: y' = max(0, y-1)\n   if S: y' = y\n\nBut we must avoid collisions. At the current state (T, y), we are at turn T (relative) and on freeway y. We must check if freeway y is unsafe at time T. If it is, then we cannot be in that state.\n\nNote: the start state: at T=0, we are at y=0. Is freeway 0 unsafe? But note: the freeways are only 1 to 8. The player is at y=0 and y=9 are safe? The problem says avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1,...,8. So at y=0 and y=9, there are no cars? Therefore, they are always safe.\n\nSo:\n   y=0: safe at all T.\n   y=9: safe at all T.\n   y=1..8: unsafe at the times we computed.\n\nTherefore, we start at (T=0, y=0) which is safe.\n\nWe wish to find the minimal H such that we can be at (H-1, 9) at the (H-1)-th relative turn (because we start at t=0 and then we do H-1 moves to get to H-1). Actually, we do H actions? Let me clarify:\n\nWe start at turn t1 (absolute) which is T=0 relative. Then we choose an action for T=0, then at T=1 we are at the next state. We do this until we reach y=9.\n\nWe want the minimal H such that at the end of H-1 turns (so after H-1 actions) we are at y=9. But note: the problem says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning we take H actions? However, the player update is: at turn t (which is absolute turn = t1+t), we take action a_{t1+t} and then we are at position at turn t1+t+1? \n\nBut the problem says: \"y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t\", so at the next turn we have the new position. Therefore, after H actions, we have H steps of time? So we start at T=0 (absolute turn t1) and after H actions we are at absolute turn t1+H? Then the position at that turn is y_{t1+H}. We want y_{t1+H} = 9.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\" and then the sequence of actions for t = t1 to t1+H-1 (so H actions) and then at the end of these actions, we are at turn t1+H and we require the position at that turn to be 9.\n\nTherefore, we are looking for the minimal H such that we can go from (0,0) at T=0 to (0,9) at T=H (absolute turn t1+H) by taking H actions.\n\nBut note: the state at T=H is after H actions. We start at T=0 (state0) and after one action (T=0) we are at state at T=1? Actually, the state after the action is at the next turn.\n\nWe can model the state at time T (relative) as the state at the beginning of turn T? But then we take an action and then we are at the beginning of turn T+1.\n\nAlternatively, we can think:\n   At relative time T (which is absolute turn t1+T), we are at position y(T). Then we choose an action a(T) and then at time T+1 (absolute turn t1+T+1) we are at y(T+1).\n\nWe require that at the moment we are at y(T) (at the beginning of turn T) we are safe? Actually, the collision condition: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 in Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T\". So when we are at (T, y(T)) we must be safe.\n\nWe start at (0,0): safe because y=0 is always safe.\n\nWe take an action at T=0 and then at T=1 we are at y(1). Then at T=1 we check the safety of (1, y(1)).\n\nWe wish to have y(H) = 9 for the smallest H.\n\nBut note: we can also stay at y=0 for a while? But we want minimal H.\n\nWe are going to do a BFS in the state (T, y) for T from 0 upwards and y from 0 to 9.\n\nWe start: (0,0) with H=0 (we haven't taken any action, but we are at the starting state). Then we take actions to move to the next state.\n\nActually, we are going to simulate:\n\n   Let state (T, y) be the state at the beginning of turn T (relative) meaning at absolute turn t1+T.\n\n   Then we choose an action a (U, D, S) which leads to:\n        y' = y + { +1 if U, -1 if D, 0 if S } (clamped to [0,9])\n        and then we move to state (T+1, y').\n\n   The cost is T+1 (because we have taken one action and we are now at turn T+1).\n\n   We want to reach a state (H, 9) for the smallest H.\n\n   Constraints: \n        - The state (T, y) must be safe: if y is 0 or 9, safe. If y in [1,8], then T must not be in the unsafe set for that freeway.\n\n   We start at (0,0): safe.\n\n   Then we generate next states: (1,0), (1,1) by actions S and U? \n        But note: from (0,0) we can:\n             S: next y = 0 -> state (1,0)\n             U: next y = 1 -> state (1,1)\n             D: next y = max(0,0-1)=0 -> same as S.\n\n   Then at T=1, we check:\n        (1,0): safe because y=0.\n        (1,1): check freeway1 at T=1: unsafe? \n            Freeway1: unsafe at T in [12,14] -> T=1 is safe -> so (1,1) is safe.\n\n   Then from (1,0): we can go to (2,0) by S or D, or (2,1) by U.\n        (2,0): safe.\n        (2,1): check freeway1 at T=2: unsafe? T=2 is not in [12,14] -> safe.\n\n   But note: we must also consider moving to freeway2? \n\nWe'll do a BFS until we reach (H,9) for the first time.\n\nWe note that the unsafe times for each freeway are bounded? For example, freeway3 is only unsafe at T=0,1,2 -> so after T=2, freeway3 is safe. Similarly, freeway6 only at T=2, freeway7 at T=6,7,8, and freeway1,2,8 at T=12,13,14.\n\nBut we hope to get to 9 quickly, so we might avoid these unsafe times.\n\nWe want the minimal H. The minimal H without any obstacles would be 9 (since we start at 0 and need to go to 9, and we can only move one per turn). But we have unsafe freeways at certain times.\n\nWe must avoid being on freeway1,2,8 at T=12,13,14; freeway3,4,5 at T=0,1,2; freeway6 at T=2; freeway7 at T=6,7,8.\n\nBut note: we start at T=0 at y=0. We cannot go to freeway1 at T=0? Actually, we are at T=0 at y=0. Then at T=1 we can be at y=1 (freeway1) and that is safe because T=1 is not in [12,14]. Similarly, we can be at freeway3 at T=1: but freeway3 is unsafe at T=0,1,2 -> so we cannot be on freeway3 at T=1.\n\nSo let's plan:\n\nWe must avoid freeways 3,4,5 at T=0,1,2? and freeway6 at T=2? and freeways 1,2,8 at T=12,13,14? and freeway7 at T=6,7,8.\n\nWe want to get to 9 as fast as possible.\n\nThe direct path: \n   T0: y0=0 -> safe.\n   T1: y1=1 (freeway1) -> safe (T1=1 not in [12,14])\n   T2: y2=2 (freeway2) -> safe (T2=2 not in [12,14])\n   T3: y3=3 (freeway3) -> at T3=3: freeway3 is safe? because unsafe only at 0,1,2 -> safe.\n   T4: y4=4 -> freeway4 at T4: safe (because unsafe only at 0,1,2) -> safe.\n   T5: y5=5 -> freeway5 at T5: safe.\n   T6: y6=6 -> freeway6 at T6: unsafe only at T=2? so T6=6 -> safe.\n   T7: y7=7 -> freeway7 at T7: unsafe at T=6,7,8 -> T7=7 is unsafe! -> collision.\n\nSo we cannot go to freeway7 at T=7. So we must avoid freeway7 at T=6,7,8.\n\nWe can try to wait at some freeway to avoid freeway7 at T=6,7,8? Or take a detour? But we can only move vertically.\n\nAlternatively, we can slow down? For example, at T5 we are at y=5. Then we can stay at y=5 for one turn? Then at T6 we are still at y=5 (safe) and then at T7 we go to y=6 (freeway6 at T7: safe) and then at T8 we go to y=7: but at T8, freeway7 is unsafe (T8=8 is in unsafe set) -> still unsafe.\n\nWe need to avoid freeway7 at T=6,7,8. So we can be at freeway7 only at T>=9? \n\nBut we also have to avoid freeways 1,2,8 at T=12,13,14. We don't want to be too late.\n\nSo let's try:\n\nWe must get through freeway7 at a safe time. The next safe time for freeway7 is T>=9. So we can be at freeway7 at T=9 or later.\n\nBut note: we are at y=5 at T5? Then we need to get to y=7 at T>=9.\n\nSo from T5 (y=5) we can:\n   T5: y5=5 -> safe.\n   T6: we can stay at 5 -> y6=5 -> safe (freeway5 is only unsafe at 0,1,2 -> safe)\n   T7: then we can go to y6=6 -> safe (freeway6 at T7: safe because unsafe only at T=2)\n   T8: then go to y7=7 -> but T8=8 is unsafe for freeway7 -> not allowed.\n\nAlternatively, at T6: we can go down? but we are at 5: down to 4? Then T6: y=4 -> safe (freeway4 unsafe only at 0,1,2 -> safe). Then T7: we can go to 5? Then T8: to 6? Then T9: to 7? Then freeway7 at T9: safe (because unsafe only at 6,7,8). Then T10: to 8, T11: to 9.\n\nBut that would be 11 turns? But we might be able to do better.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to go faster at the beginning and then wait? \n\nWe must avoid freeway7 at T=6,7,8. So we can be at freeway7 at earliest T=9.\n\nWe start at T0:0 -> T1:1 -> T2:2 -> T3:3 -> T4:4 -> T5:5 -> T6:5 (stay) -> T7:6 -> T8:7 (but T8=8? wait, T8 is the 8th relative turn? Actually, the time index T is the relative turn. So:\n\n   T0: y0=0\n   T1: y1=1\n   T2: y2=2\n   T3: y3=3\n   T4: y4=4\n   T5: y5=5\n   T6: y6=5 (stay at 5)\n   T7: y7=6\n   T8: y8=7 -> but at T8, freeway7 is unsafe? Yes, because T=8 is in {6,7,8} -> unsafe.\n\nSo we cannot be at freeway7 at T8. We must be at freeway7 at T>=9.\n\nSo from T5: we can wait two turns? \n\n   T5: y5=5\n   T6: y6=5 (stay)\n   T7: y7=5 (stay again) -> then T7: we are at freeway5 at T7: safe? yes, because unsafe only at 0,1,2.\n   T8: y8=6 (from 5 to 6) -> freeway6 at T8: safe (only unsafe at T=2)\n   T9: y9=7 -> freeway7 at T9: safe (since 9 not in {6,7,8})\n   T10: y10=8 -> freeway8 at T10: unsafe? freeway8 is unsafe at T=12,13,14 -> T10=10 is safe.\n   T11: y11=9 -> goal.\n\nSo that's 11 turns.\n\nBut can we do better? What if we avoid freeway7 by being at freeway7 at T=9, but without waiting two turns? \n\nWe can try to go faster at the beginning? We started at T0:0 -> T1:1 -> T2:2 -> T3:3 -> T4:4 -> T5:5 -> that's 5 turns to get to 5. Then we need to wait until T9 to be at freeway7? So we have 4 turns to wait? Then we do:\n\n   T5:5\n   T6:5 (wait)\n   T7:5 (wait)\n   T8:5 (wait) -> then T8: still at 5\n   T9:6? Then T10:7? Then T11:8, T12:9 -> that's 12 turns.\n\nBut we can use the waiting time to move up? Actually, we are at 5 and we can only move up one per turn. We must get to 7 at T9. So we need to leave 5 at T8? \n\n   T5:5\n   T6:5 (wait) -> safe\n   T7:6 -> safe (freeway6 at T7: safe)\n   T8:7 -> but freeway7 at T8: unsafe -> not allowed.\n\nSo we must not be at 7 until T>=9. Therefore, we can be at 6 at T8? Then:\n\n   T5:5\n   T6:5 (wait)\n   T7:6 (from 5 to 6 at T7: safe for freeway6 at T7: safe)\n   T8:6 (stay at 6) -> freeway6 at T8: safe (only unsafe at T=2)\n   T9:7 -> freeway7 at T9: safe\n   T10:8\n   T11:9\n\nThat's 11 turns (T0 to T11: 11 steps? because we have 11 actions? Let's count:\n\n   T0: start at 0 -> action for T0: U to 1 -> at T1 we are at 1.\n   T1: U to 2 -> at T2:2\n   T2: U to 3 -> at T3:3\n   T3: U to 4 -> at T4:4\n   T4: U to 5 -> at T5:5\n   T5: S (stay at 5) -> at T6:5\n   T6: S (stay at 5) -> at T7:5? Then we are not at 6 at T7? \n\nWe need to get to 6 at T7? Then we must have at T6: move from 5 to 6? Then:\n\n   T5: we are at 5 (at the beginning of T5). Then we take action U: so at T6 we are at 6.\n   Then at T6: we are at 6 -> freeway6 at T6: safe? (unsafe only at T=2 -> safe) -> yes.\n   Then at T6: we take action S: stay at 6 -> then at T7: we are at 6? \n        But we want to be at 6 at T7? Actually, we are at 6 at T6 and then we stay so at T7 we are at 6.\n   Then at T7: we take action U: then at T8 we are at 7 -> but T8: freeway7 is unsafe? yes, T8=8? wait: T is the relative time. \n\nThe state at the beginning of turn T is the state after the previous action? And then we take an action during turn T and then we are at the beginning of turn T+1.\n\nSo:\n\n   T0: start at 0 -> take action U -> at the beginning of T1 we are at 1.\n   T1: at 1 -> take action U -> at the beginning of T2 we are at 2.\n   T2: at 2 -> take action U -> at the beginning of T3 we are at 3.\n   T3: at 3 -> take action U -> at the beginning of T4 we are at 4.\n   T4: at 4 -> take action U -> at the beginning of T5 we are at 5.\n   T5: at 5 -> take action U -> at the beginning of T6 we are at 6.\n   T6: at 6 -> take action S -> at the beginning of T7 we are at 6.\n   T7: at 6 -> take action S -> at the beginning of T8 we are at 6.\n   T8: at 6 -> take action U -> at the beginning of T9 we are at 7.\n   T9: at 7 -> take action U -> at the beginning of T10 we are at 8.\n   T10: at 8 -> take action U -> at the beginning of T11 we are at 9.\n\nBut we are at 9 at the beginning of T11? Then we have taken 11 actions (from T0 to T10) and we are at 9 at T11? \n\nThe problem: we want at the end of the sequence of H actions to be at (0,9). The sequence is a_{t1} to a_{t1+H-1}. Then after these H actions, we are at turn t1+H and position (0,9).\n\nSo we are at the beginning of turn t1+H at position (0,9). But we started at the beginning of turn t1 at (0,0). Then we have taken H actions? Actually, we take one action per turn. So:\n\n   At the beginning of turn t1: we are at (0,0). Then we take action a_{t1} -> then at the beginning of turn t1+1 we are at next state.\n\n   Then we take H actions: a_{t1}, a_{t1+1}, ..., a_{t1+H-1} -> then we are at the beginning of turn t1+H at state (0,9).\n\nTherefore, H = 11? But note: we are at (0,9) at the beginning of turn t1+11? Then we have taken 11 actions? \n\nBut the minimal H without obstacles is 9: we could have done:\n\n   T0: U -> T1:1\n   T1: U -> T2:2\n   T2: U -> T3:3\n   T3: U -> T4:4\n   T4: U -> T5:5\n   T5: U -> T6:6\n   T6: U -> T7:7 -> but T7: freeway7 is unsafe (T7=7 relative -> absolute turn t1+7) -> so we cannot.\n\nSo our 11-step plan is:\n\n   Actions: \n        T0 (absolute t1=30): U\n        T1: U\n        T2: U\n        T3: U\n        T4: U\n        T5: U   -> now we are at 6 at the beginning of T6? Actually, no: \n            T0: start at 0 -> after U: at T1 we are at 1.\n            T1: at 1 -> U: at T2 at 2.\n            T2: at 2 -> U: at T3 at 3.\n            T3: at 3 -> U: at T4 at 4.\n            T4: at 4 -> U: at T5 at 5.\n            T5: at 5 -> U: at T6 at 6.\n\n        Then T6: we do S -> then at T7 we are at 6.\n        T7: S -> at T8 at 6.\n        T8: U -> at T9 at 7.\n        T9: U -> at T10 at 8.\n        T10: U -> at T11 at 9.\n\n        So we have taken 11 actions? from T0 to T10: 11 actions? \n        Actually, the actions are for turns: \n             turn30: a30 = U\n             turn31: a31 = U\n             turn32: a32 = U\n             turn33: a33 = U\n             turn34: a34 = U\n             turn35: a35 = U\n             turn36: a36 = S\n             turn37: a37 = S\n             turn38: a38 = U\n             turn39: a39 = U\n             turn40: a40 = U\n\n        Then at the beginning of turn41 (absolute) we are at y=9.\n\n        So H = 11? because we have 11 actions.\n\nBut wait: we are at 9 at turn41? But we started at turn30. So we took 11 actions? and the minimal H is 11.\n\nBut can we do 10? \n\nWe must be at freeway7 at a safe time: at T>=9. And we start at T0=0 at y=0.\n\nThe minimal time to get to freeway7 (y=7) is 7 moves (if we go up every time). But that would be at T7: and T7=7 is unsafe.\n\nSo we must delay until T>=9. The minimal delay is 2 turns. Then we get to freeway7 at T9? Then we need 2 more moves to get to 9 (from 7 to 9: two moves). So total turns: 9 (for moving from 0 to 7) but then we add 2 delays -> so 11 moves? \n\nBut note: we can interleave the delays. \n\nAlternatively, we can go faster at the beginning? We can only move one per turn. \n\nOr we can go up to 6 at T6 (6 moves) and then wait at 6 for 2 turns (at T6: we are at 6, then we wait at T6 and T7: so at T8 we are still at 6? Then at T8 we move to 7 -> but T8=8 is unsafe? so we cannot.\n\nWe must wait at 6 until T8? Then at T8 we move to 7 -> but T8=8 is unsafe? So we have to wait until T9 to move to 7.\n\nSo we must be at 6 at T8? Then at T8 we take action to move to 7? Then we are at 7 at T9: safe.\n\nHow to be at 6 at T8? \n\n   We start at 0 at T0.\n   We need to get to 6 at the beginning of T8.\n\n   We can do: \n        T0: U -> T1:1\n        T1: U -> T2:2\n        T2: U -> T3:3\n        T3: U -> T4:4\n        T4: U -> T5:5\n        T5: U -> T6:6 -> then we are at 6 at T6? Then we can wait at 6 for two turns: \n        T6: S -> T7:6\n        T7: S -> T8:6 -> then at T8 we are at 6? Then we take U at T8: then at T9 we are at 7.\n\n        Then T9: U -> T10:8\n        T10: U -> T11:9 -> 11 moves.\n\nAlternatively, we can wait at an earlier row? \n\nBut we must avoid freeway3,4,5 at T0,1,2. We are going through them at T3,4,5: which is safe.\n\nWe must avoid freeway7 at T6,7,8: so we avoid by not being at 7 during those turns.\n\nBut we can also try to go down? For example, when we are at 5 at T5, we can go down to 4? Then we can wait at 4? \n\n   T5: at 5 -> D -> then at T6 we are at 4.\n   T6: at 4 -> S -> T7:4\n   T7: at 4 -> U -> T8:5\n   T8: at 5 -> U -> T9:6\n   T9: at 6 -> U -> T10:7 -> but at T10: freeway7 is safe? yes, because T10=10 not in {6,7,8}. Then T10: U -> T11:8, T12:9 -> 12 moves.\n\nWorse.\n\nWe can try to go to 9 in 10 moves? \n\nWe must be at 9 at the beginning of T10? \n\nWe need to be at freeway7 at T? where T must be at least 9? But T10 is the beginning of the 10th relative turn? Then we must have been at freeway7 at T9? because to go from 7 to 8 to 9: that takes two moves? \n\nAt T8: we must be at 7? Then at T8: freeway7 is unsafe (T8=8) -> not allowed.\n\nAt T9: we must be at 7? Then we move at T9: from 7 to 8? Then at T10: we are at 8? Then we need one more move to 9? Then at T11:9.\n\nSo we cannot get to 9 at T10? We have to get to 9 at T11 at the earliest.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 11.\n\nBut let me confirm the unsafe sets for freeway8: we have to be at freeway8 at T10? freeway8 is unsafe at T=12,13,14 -> T10=10 is safe? yes.\n\nSo the plan we have is:\n\n   T0 (absolute 30): U -> then at T1 (absolute31) we are at 1.\n   T1: U -> T2:2\n   T2: U -> T3:3\n   T3: U -> T4:4\n   T4: U -> T5:5\n   T5: U -> T6:6   [at T6: freeway6: T6=6 -> safe? because unsafe only at T=2 -> safe]\n   T6: S -> T7:6   [freeway6 at T7=7: safe? yes]\n   T7: S -> T8:6   [freeway6 at T8=8: safe? yes]\n   T8: U -> T9:7   [freeway7 at T9=9: safe? yes (not in {6,7,8})]\n   T9: U -> T10:8  [freeway8 at T10=10: safe? (not in [12,14]) -> safe]\n   T10: U -> T11:9 -> goal.\n\nSo 11 actions: a30 to a40.\n\nBut note: we start at T0 (absolute30) and we take 11 actions: up to a40? Then at the beginning of turn41 we are at 9.\n\nBut the problem: the sequence of actions is for t = t1 to t1+H-1 -> so H=11, then actions from t1=30 to 30+10=40? So 11 actions.\n\nTherefore, the answer:\n\nTurn 30: U\nTurn 31: U\nTurn 32: U\nTurn 33: U\nTurn 34: U\nTurn 35: U\nTurn 36: S\nTurn 37: S\nTurn 38: U\nTurn 39: U\nTurn 40: U\n\nBut wait: at T5 (absolute35) we do U to go from 5 to 6? Then at T6 (absolute36) we are at 6. Then we do S at T6 (absolute36) -> then we are at 6 at T7 (absolute37). Then S at T7 (absolute37) -> at T8 (absolute38) at 6. Then U at T8 (absolute38) -> at T9 (absolute39) at 7. Then U at T9 (absolute39) -> at T10 (absolute40) at 8. Then U at T10 (absolute40) -> at T11 (absolute41) at 9.\n\nSo the last action is at absolute40? and we have taken 11 actions: from 30 to 40 inclusive? That's 11 actions.\n\nBut the problem says: sequence {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} -> so t from 0 to 10 (11 terms). And we want to be at 9 at the next turn (absolute41).\n\nTherefore, H=11.\n\nBut is there a 10-action plan? \n\nWe must be at 9 at the beginning of turn40? Then we must have been at 8 at the beginning of turn39? and then taken U at turn39 to get to 9 at turn40.\n\nThen we must have been at 7 at the beginning of turn38? and taken U at turn38 to get to 8 at turn39.\n\nThen we must have been at 7 at the beginning of turn38: so we were at 7 at turn38? Then we were at freeway7 at turn38? which is T=8 (relative) -> unsafe? because freeway7 is unsafe at T=6,7,8 -> T=8 is unsafe -> collision.\n\nSo we cannot be at 7 at turn38? Therefore, we cannot have a 10-action plan.\n\nThus, minimal H=11.\n\nBut note: we could be at 8 at turn38? Then we can go to 9 at turn39? Then we are at 9 at turn40? That would be 10 actions? \n\nHow to be at 8 at turn38? \n\n   We start at 0 at turn30.\n   We need to get to 8 at the beginning of turn38? (which is T=8 relative).\n\n   The moves: we need 8 moves up? and 0 moves wait? that would be 8 moves: \n        turn30: U -> turn31:1\n        turn31: U -> turn32:2\n        turn32: U -> turn33:3\n        turn33: U -> turn34:4\n        turn34: U -> turn35:5\n        turn35: U -> turn36:6\n        turn36: U -> turn37:7 -> at turn37: we are at 7? Then at turn37 (T=7 relative) we are at freeway7: unsafe? (T=7 is in unsafe set) -> collision.\n\n   So we cannot.\n\n   Alternatively, we can avoid freeway7 at T=7? We must be at freeway7 at T=7? because we are at 7 at turn37? which is T=7.\n\n   So we have to wait somewhere? \n\n   We can try to be at 7 at T=9? Then we would be at 8 at T=10? and 9 at T=11? which is 11 actions.\n\nTherefore, 11 is minimal.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\nTurn 30: U\nTurn 31: U\nTurn 32: U\nTurn 33: U\nTurn 34: U\nTurn 35: U\nTurn 36: S\nTurn 37: S\nTurn 38: U\nTurn 39: U\nTurn 40: U\n\nBut note: we have two S actions? and then three U at the end? \n\nWe can write the sequence.\n\nBut let me check the safety of the entire path:\n\n   Turn30: start at (0,0) -> safe (y=0)\n   Action U -> next state: at turn31: (0,1) -> freeway1 at T=1: safe? (freeway1 unsafe only at 12,13,14 -> safe)\n\n   Turn31: at (0,1) -> freeway1 at T=1: safe -> then action U -> turn32: (0,2) -> freeway2 at T=2: safe? (freeway2 unsafe at 12,13,14 -> safe)\n\n   Turn32: at (0,2) -> freeway2 at T=2: safe -> action U -> turn33: (0,3) -> freeway3 at T=3: safe? (freeway3 unsafe at 0,1,2 -> safe)\n\n   Turn33: at (0,3) -> freeway3 at T=3: safe -> action U -> turn34: (0,4) -> freeway4 at T=4: safe? (unsafe at 0,1,2 -> safe)\n\n   Turn34: at (0,4) -> freeway4 at T=4: safe -> action U -> turn35: (0,5) -> freeway5 at T=5: safe? (unsafe at 0,1,2 -> safe)\n\n   Turn35: at (0,5) -> freeway5 at T=5: safe -> action U -> turn36: (0,6) -> freeway6 at T=6: safe? (unsafe only at T=2 -> safe)\n\n   Turn36: at (0,6) -> freeway6 at T=6: safe -> action S -> turn37: (0,6) -> same position? Actually, we are at 6 at the beginning of turn36? Then we take S -> then at the beginning of turn37 we are at 6? Then at turn37: we are at 6 -> freeway6 at T=7: safe? (only unsafe at T=2) -> safe.\n\n   Turn37: at (0,6) -> action S -> turn38: (0,6) -> then at turn38: we are at 6 -> freeway6 at T=8: safe? yes.\n\n   Turn38: at (0,6) -> action U -> turn39: (0,7) -> freeway7 at T=9: safe? (unsafe at 6,7,8 -> T=9 is safe) -> safe.\n\n   Turn39: at (0,7) -> action U -> turn40: (0,8) -> freeway8 at T=10: safe? (unsafe at 12,13,14 -> safe)\n\n   Turn40: at (0,8) -> action U -> turn41: (0,9) -> goal.\n\nSo it's safe.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 11.\n\nSo we output:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 30: U\nTurn 31: U\nTurn 32: U\nTurn 33: U\nTurn 34: U\nTurn 35: U\nTurn 36: S\nTurn 37: S\nTurn 38: U\nTurn 39: U\nTurn 40: U\n}\n\nNote: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", but H is the number of actions? and we have 11 actions? So H=11.\n\nBut the answer format is the sequence of actions for turns 30 to 30+10=40? yes.\n\nSo we write the actions for each turn.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 30\\) is 11. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1, \\dots, 8\\) by considering the unsafe times for each freeway:\n\n- Freeways 3, 4, 5 are unsafe at turns \\(T = 0, 1, 2\\) (relative to \\(t_1\\)).\n- Freeway 6 is unsafe at \\(T = 2\\).\n- Freeway 7 is unsafe at \\(T = 6, 7, 8\\).\n- Freeways 1, 2, 8 are unsafe at \\(T = 12, 13, 14\\).\n\nThe path is designed to:\n- Move up to \\(y = 6\\) by turn 35 (relative \\(T = 5\\) to \\(T = 5\\)), avoiding freeways 3, 4, 5 during \\(T = 0, 1, 2\\).\n- Stay at \\(y = 6\\) for turns 36 and 37 (relative \\(T = 6\\) and \\(T = 7\\)) to avoid freeway 7 during \\(T = 6, 7, 8\\).\n- Move up to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 38 (relative \\(T = 8\\)), which is safe for freeway 7 at \\(T = 8\\) (since freeway 7 is unsafe at \\(T = 6, 7, 8\\), \\(T = 8\\) is unsafe, but the move to \\(y = 7\\) occurs at turn 38, placing the player at \\(y = 7\\) at the beginning of turn 39, which is relative \\(T = 9\\), a safe time).\n- Move up to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 39 (relative \\(T = 9\\)) and \\(y = 9\\) at turn 40 (relative \\(T = 10\\)), avoiding freeways 1, 2, 8 during \\(T = 12, 13, 14\\).\n\nThe sequence of actions is:\n\n```\nTurn 30: U\nTurn 31: U\nTurn 32: U\nTurn 33: U\nTurn 34: U\nTurn 35: U\nTurn 36: S\nTurn 37: S\nTurn 38: U\nTurn 39: U\nTurn 40: U\n```\n\nThis results in the player reaching \\((0, 9)\\) at turn 41 (\\(t_1 + H = 30 + 11 = 41\\)) after 11 actions.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 30: U\nTurn 31: U\nTurn 32: U\nTurn 33: U\nTurn 34: U\nTurn 35: U\nTurn 36: S\nTurn 37: S\nTurn 38: U\nTurn 39: U\nTurn 40: U\n}",

The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing the y-position by +1, -1, or 0 respectively, but y must stay within 0 to 9.\n\nCollision occurs if at some turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T and for that freeway, there is a car such that 0 is in its span at that turn. The span changes over time based on the car's direction and speed.\n\nImportant note: when the player moves to a new y-position, they are not on that freeway until the next turn. So if at turn T, they move from y_T to y_{T+1}, at turn T they are still on y_T, and only on turn T+1 are they on y_{T+1}. So for collision, we care about the player's y-position at the start of the turn.\n\nLet me denote the player's y-position at turn t as y_t. At turn t, the player chooses action a_t, which determines y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with Δy_t based on a_t.\n\nThe collision condition: at turn T, if the player is on freeway k (so y_T = k), and for that freeway, there is a car where 0 is in its span at turn T.\n\nThe span is given for turn t_1=36, and we need to compute for future turns.\n\nt_1 is 36, so at turn 36, player is at y=0.\n\nWe need to get to y=9.\n\nSince y=0 is the start, and y=9 is the goal, and freeways are from 1 to 8, we need to cross these freeways.\n\nThe minimal H should be at least 9, since we start at 0 and need to get to 9, each move can increase y by at most 1, so minimum 9 turns if we always go up, but we have to avoid cars, so it might take longer if we have to wait or go down sometimes.\n\nBut we can also stay or go down, so H could be more than 9.\n\nNow, let's look at the car states at turn 36.\n\nFor each freeway k from 1 to 8, there are cars listed.\n\nI need to find out for each freeway and each turn, whether there is a car where 0 is in its span, meaning that if the player is on that freeway at that turn, they would collide.\n\nSince collision depends on the position at turn T, and the car spans at turn T.\n\nAlso, the cars move over time.\n\nLet me first list all the cars for each freeway at t=36.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: head h=-48, tail τ=-59, direction right, speed s=4.\n\nSince direction is right, for a right-moving car, span is [τ, h], so at t=36, span is [-59, -48], I think? Head and tail: for right-moving, head is the front, so if moving right, head should be greater than tail, I think.\n\nLook at the car update rules.\n\nFor left-moving: span at t_1 is [h, τ], and at T, [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nFor right-moving: span at t_1 is [τ, h], and at T, [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nIn the table, for freeway 3, it has (48,37,right,4) and (0,-11,right,4). For (48,37,right,4), since right-moving, span should be [τ, h] = [37,48]? But 37 to 48, and direction right, so head should be 48, tail 37, so as it moves right, both increase.\n\nSimilarly, (0,-11,right,4), head=0, tail=-11? But tail -11, head 0, so span [τ,h] = [-11,0].\n\nIn the update, for right-moving, span at T is [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nSimilarly for left-moving.\n\nNow for freeway 1: car (-48,-59,right,4)\n\nDirection right, so span at t_1=36 is [τ, h] = [-59, -48]? Head is -48, tail is -59, but since moving right, head should be the right end, so if tail is -59 and head is -48, that means the car is from left to right, with left end at -59, right end at -48, so as it moves right, positions increase.\n\nSo at t=36, span is [-59, -48] for this car.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 2: same as freeway 1, (-48,-59,right,4), so span [-59,-48] at t=36.\n\nFreeway 3: two cars: (48,37,right,4) and (0,-11,right,4)\n\nFirst car: (48,37,right,4), head=48, tail=37, so span [τ,h] = [37,48] at t=36.\n\nSecond car: (0,-11,right,4), head=0, tail=-11, span [-11,0] at t=36.\n\nFreeway 4: same as freeway 3, (48,37,right,4) and (0,-11,right,4), so spans [37,48] and [-11,0] at t=36.\n\nFreeway 5: same as 3 and 4, [37,48] and [-11,0].\n\nFreeway 6: (48,83,left,36)\n\nDirection left, so for left-moving, span at t_1 is [h, τ] = [48,83]? Head h=48, tail τ=83? But if left-moving, head is the left end, I think.\n\nIn the update rule: for left-moving, span at t_1 is [h, τ], and at T, [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nHere, (48,83,left,36), so h=48, τ=83, so at t=36, span is [48,83].\n\nSince left-moving, as time increases, both positions decrease.\n\nFreeway 7: three cars: (48,37,right,4), (12,1,right,4), (-24,-35,right,4)\n\nSo, first car: (48,37,right,4) span [37,48]\n\nSecond: (12,1,right,4) span [1,12]\n\nThird: (-24,-35,right,4) span [-35,-24]\n\nFreeway 8: (-48,-59,right,4) span [-59,-48]\n\nNow, for collision, we care about when 0 is in the span for a given freeway at a given turn.\n\nThat is, for freeway k at turn T, if there is a car on k such that 0 is between its min and max position at that turn.\n\nSince the span is an interval, 0 is in [min, max] inclusive, I assume.\n\nNow, for each freeway and each car, I can find when 0 is in its span.\n\nBut since multiple cars, I need to check for each turn if any car on that freeway has 0 in span.\n\nFirst, let's define the time relative to t_1=36.\n\nSet τ = T - t_1, so at τ=0, it's turn 36.\n\nThen for a given turn T, τ = T - 36.\n\nNow, for each car, the span at τ is:\n\nFor right-moving car: span at τ is [τ_0 + s τ, h_0 + s τ] where τ_0 and h_0 are at τ=0.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving.\n\n0 is in the span if min <= 0 <= max.\n\nFor a right-moving car with span [τ_0 + s τ, h_0 + s τ], 0 is in span if τ_0 + s τ <= 0 <= h_0 + s τ.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving: [h_0 - s τ, τ_0 - s τ], and 0 in span if h_0 - s τ <= 0 <= τ_0 - s τ.\n\nNow, for each freeway, I can find for which τ the freeway is occupied at position 0.\n\nBut we need to consider the player's position over time.\n\nSince the player moves step by step, we need to find a path from y=0 at τ=0 to y=9 at some τ=H-1, with actions at each step.\n\nτ starts from 0.\n\nAt τ=0, turn t=36, y=0.\n\nAfter action a_{t}, y_{t+1} is set.\n\nLet me index the turns.\n\nLet t be the turn number, starting from t=36.\n\nSo at t=36, y=0.\n\nAfter action a_t, y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nThen at turn t, player is on freeway y_t.\n\nCollision if at turn t, for freeway k=y_t, there is a car with 0 in span at turn t.\n\nNow, for each t, and each k, we can compute if freeway k is occupied at turn t.\n\nOccupied meaning that 0 is in some car's span on that freeway at turn t.\n\nIf occupied, player cannot be on that freeway at that turn.\n\nOtherwise, it's safe.\n\ny_t must be between 0 and 9 inclusive.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are not freeways, I think. Freeways are y=1 to 8 for cars.\n\nThe collision is only for freeways y=1 to 8.\n\nFor y=0 and y=9, no cars, so always safe.\n\nThe player starts at y=0 at t=36, which is safe.\n\nGoal is to be at y=9 at some turn.\n\nAt turn t, if y_t = k for k=1-8, and k is occupied at t, collision.\n\nIf y_t =0 or 9, no collision possible.\n\nAlso, when moving, at turn t, player is on y_t, not on y_{t+1} until next turn.\n\nSo to avoid collision, for each turn t, y_t must not be in 1-8 or if it is, freeway y_t must not be occupied at turn t.\n\nNow, let's find for each freeway k, and for each t, whether it is occupied at turn t.\n\nt is absolute turn, but since we start at t=36, let me use τ = t - 36, so τ=0,1,2,... for turns after.\n\nAt τ=0, t=36.\n\nFor each freeway, cars:\n\nFreeway 1: one car, right-moving, s=4, span at τ=0: [τ_0, h_0] = [-59,-48]\n\nSo span at τ: [-59 + 4τ, -48 + 4τ]\n\n0 in span if -59 + 4τ <= 0 <= -48 + 4τ\n\nWhich is -59 + 4τ <= 0 and 0 <= -48 + 4τ\n\nSo 4τ <= 59 and 4τ >= 48\n\nτ <= 59/4 = 14.75, so τ <= 14 since integer\n\nτ >= 48/4 = 12\n\nSo τ from 12 to 14 inclusive.\n\nThus freeway 1 occupied at τ=12,13,14.\n\nτ = t - 36, so at t=48,49,50.\n\nBut we can use τ.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same as freeway 1, occupied τ=12,13,14.\n\nFreeway 3: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (48,37,right,4), at τ=0 span [37,48]\n\nSpan at τ: [37 + 4τ, 48 + 4τ]\n\n0 in span? 37 + 4τ <= 0 <= 48 + 4τ\n\n37 + 4τ <= 0 implies 4τ <= -37, impossible since τ>=0, so never.\n\nSimilarly, 0 <= 48 + 4τ always true for τ>=0, but min is 37+4τ >0, so 0 not in span for this car.\n\nSecond car: (0,-11,right,4), at τ=0 span [-11,0]\n\nSpan at τ: [-11 + 4τ, 0 + 4τ] = [-11 + 4τ, 4τ]\n\n0 in span if -11 + 4τ <= 0 <= 4τ\n\nSince max is 4τ, 0 <= 4τ always for τ>=0.\n\nMin -11+4τ <=0 implies 4τ <=11, τ <= 2.75, so τ <=2\n\nAnd 0 <= 4τ always for τ>=0.\n\nSo 0 in span when min <=0, i.e. -11+4τ <=0, so 4τ <=11, τ<=2.75, so τ=0,1,2.\n\nAt τ=0, min=-11, max=0, so 0 is included, yes.\n\nSimilarly τ=1, min=-7, max=4, 0 in [-7,4]\n\nτ=2, min=-3, max=8, 0 in.\n\nτ=3, min=1, max=12, 0 not in.\n\nSo for second car, occupied τ=0,1,2.\n\nNow, for freeway 3, occupied if either car has 0 in span.\n\nFirst car never, second car at τ=0,1,2.\n\nSo freeway 3 occupied at τ=0,1,2.\n\nτ=0 is turn 36, etc.\n\nFreeway 4: same as freeway 3, occupied τ=0,1,2.\n\nSimilarly freeway 5: same, occupied τ=0,1,2.\n\nFreeway 6: (48,83,left,36)\n\nDirection left, s=36.\n\nAt τ=0, span [h, τ] = [48,83] since left-moving.\n\nHead h=48, tail τ=83, so [h, τ] = [48,83]\n\nSpan at τ: [h - s τ, τ - s τ] = [48 - 36τ, 83 - 36τ]\n\n0 in span if 48 - 36τ <= 0 <= 83 - 36τ\n\nFirst, 48 - 36τ <= 0 => 36τ >=48 => τ >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈1.333, so τ >=2 since integer? τ >= ceil(4/3)=2? Let's see.\n\n48 - 36τ <=0 => 36τ >=48 => τ >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈1.333, so for integer τ, τ >=2.\n\nSimilarly, 0 <= 83 - 36τ => 36τ <=83 => τ <= 83/36 ≈2.305, so τ <=2.\n\nThus τ >=2 and τ <=2, so only τ=2.\n\nAt τ=2, min=48-72= -24, max=83-72=11, so [ -24,11], 0 in.\n\nAt τ=1, min=48-36=12, max=83-36=47, [12,47], 0 not in.\n\nτ=3, min=48-108= -60, max=83-108= -25, [-60,-25], 0 not in.\n\nSo only τ=2 occupied for freeway 6.\n\nFreeway 7: three cars.\n\nFirst car: (48,37,right,4), span at τ: [37+4τ, 48+4τ], min>0 for τ>=0, so 0 never in span.\n\nSecond car: (12,1,right,4), span at τ: [1+4τ, 12+4τ], min=1+4τ >=1>0, so 0 never in span.\n\nThird car: (-24,-35,right,4), span at τ: [-35+4τ, -24+4τ]\n\n0 in span if -35+4τ <=0 <= -24+4τ\n\nSo -35+4τ <=0 => 4τ <=35 => τ <=35/4=8.75, τ<=8\n\nAnd 0 <= -24+4τ => 4τ >=24 => τ>=6\n\nSo τ=6,7,8.\n\nAt τ=6, min=-35+24= -11, max=-24+24=0, so [ -11,0], 0 in.\n\nτ=7, min=-35+28= -7, max=-24+28=4, [ -7,4], 0 in.\n\nτ=8, min=-35+32= -3, max=-24+32=8, [ -3,8], 0 in.\n\nτ=5, min=-35+20= -15, max=-24+20= -4, [-15,-4], 0 not in.\n\nτ=9, min=-35+36=1, max=-24+36=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo only third car can have 0, at τ=6,7,8.\n\nFirst and second cars never have 0 in span, so freeway 7 occupied at τ=6,7,8.\n\nFreeway 8: (-48,-59,right,4), similar to freeway 1.\n\nSpan at τ: [-59+4τ, -48+4τ]\n\n0 in span if -59+4τ <=0 <= -48+4τ\n\nSo -59+4τ <=0 => 4τ <=59 => τ<=14.75, τ<=14\n\n0 <= -48+4τ => 4τ >=48 => τ>=12\n\nSo τ=12,13,14 occupied.\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway, the turns τ where it is occupied (0 in some car span):\n\nFreeway 1: τ=12,13,14\n\nFreeway 2: same, τ=12,13,14\n\nFreeway 3: τ=0,1,2\n\nFreeway 4: τ=0,1,2\n\nFreeway 5: τ=0,1,2\n\nFreeway 6: τ=2\n\nFreeway 7: τ=6,7,8\n\nFreeway 8: τ=12,13,14\n\nτ=0 is turn 36.\n\nThe player starts at τ=0, y=0.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at some future turn.\n\nSince we can only change y by -1,0,+1 each turn, the minimal number of steps to go from 0 to 9 is 9 steps, all up, but we need to avoid the occupied freeways at the times we are on them.\n\ny_t must be such that if y_t in 1-8, then τ not in the occupied times for that k.\n\nSince we are at τ=0, and y=0, which is safe.\n\nNow, let me list the occupied times for each k:\n\nk=1: occ at τ=12,13,14\n\nk=2: occ τ=12,13,14\n\nk=3: occ τ=0,1,2\n\nk=4: occ τ=0,1,2\n\nk=5: occ τ=0,1,2\n\nk=6: occ τ=2\n\nk=7: occ τ=6,7,8\n\nk=8: occ τ=12,13,14\n\nFor k=3,4,5, occupied at τ=0,1,2, which means that at turns τ=0,1,2, we cannot be on these freeways.\n\nBut at τ=0, we are at y=0, which is not a freeway, so ok.\n\nSimilarly, we need to be careful when we cross.\n\nSince y changes slowly, we need to plan the path over time.\n\nThe goal is to minimize H, the number of turns, so we want to reach y=9 as fast as possible.\n\nMinimal H is 9, if we go up every turn.\n\nBut let's see if it's possible.\n\nStart at τ=0, y=0.\n\nAfter action a_t, y_{t+1} is set.\n\nAt turn t (τ relative to 36), player on y_t.\n\nFor τ=0, t=36, y=0.\n\nIf we go up at τ=0, y_{τ=1} =1, but at τ=0, we are still on y=0, safe.\n\nAt τ=1, we are on y=1 (if we moved up).\n\nBut freeway 1 is not occupied at τ=1? Freeway 1 occupied only at τ=12,13,14, so at τ=1, freeway 1 is safe? k=1 occupied τ=12,13,14, so at τ=1, not occupied, so should be safe.\n\nBut we need to check all.\n\nAt τ=1, if y=1, freeway 1: occupied? From above, k=1 occ at τ=12-14, not at τ=1, so yes, freeway 1 is safe at τ=1.\n\nSimilarly, if we go to y=1 at τ=1.\n\nBut let's list the safety.\n\nFor each τ and each k, whether occupied.\n\nSince k=1 to 8, and τ from 0 up.\n\nFor τ=0: k=3,4,5 occupied? k=3 occ τ=0,1,2, so at τ=0, k=3,4,5 occupied.\n\nk=1,2,6,7,8 not occupied at τ=0.\n\nSimilarly τ=1: k=3,4,5 occupied (since τ=0,1,2), k=1,2,6,7,8 not.\n\nτ=2: k=3,4,5,6 occupied (k=6 at τ=2), k=1,2,7,8 not.\n\nτ=3: no k occupied? k=3 occ only τ=0,1,2, so not τ=3. k=6 only τ=2, not. k=7 occ τ=6,7,8, not yet. So at τ=3, all freeways safe? Let's see:\n\nk=1: occ τ=12-14\n\nk=2: same\n\nk=3: occ τ=0,1,2\n\nk=4: same\n\nk=5: same\n\nk=6: occ τ=2\n\nk=7: occ τ=6,7,8\n\nk=8: occ τ=12-14\n\nSo at τ=3, no freeway occupied, so all k safe.\n\nSimilarly τ=4: same, no occ.\n\nτ=5: no occ, k=7 occ at 6,7,8.\n\nτ=6: k=7 occupied\n\nτ=7: k=7 occupied\n\nτ=8: k=7 occupied\n\nτ=9: no occ? k=7 occ τ=6,7,8, so not τ=9.\n\nτ=10: no\n\nτ=11: no\n\nτ=12: k=1,2,8 occupied? k=1,2,8 occ at 12,13,14.\n\nk=8 occ τ=12-14.\n\nNow, back to the player.\n\nWe start at τ=0, y=0.\n\nWe want to go to y=9.\n\nMinimal path: always up, so actions: U,U,U,... 9 times, to reach y=9 at τ=9.\n\nBut we need to check for each turn τ, what y_τ is, and if y_τ in 1-8, whether it is occupied at that τ.\n\ny_τ is position at turn τ.\n\nAt turn τ, y_τ.\n\nThen after action, y_{τ+1} = y_τ + Δy.\n\nFor the sequence: at τ=0, y=0.\n\nAction a_0: suppose U, then y_1 =1 (since y_{t+1} with t=τ)\n\nNotation: at time τ, after action, position for next turn.\n\nDefine:\n\nAt turn t (absolute or relative), at the start, y_t is position.\n\nThen choose action a_t, which determines y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nThen at turn t, player is on freeway y_t.\n\nFor collision at turn t: if y_t in 1-8 and freeway y_t occupied at turn t.\n\nIn terms of τ: at τ, y_τ, and freeway y_τ occupied at τ.\n\nThen after action a_τ, y_{τ+1} set.\n\nNow, for all up: start τ=0, y=0.\n\na_0: U, then y_1 =1\n\nAt τ=0, y_0=0, not freeway, safe.\n\na_1: U, y_2=2\n\nAt τ=1, y_1=1, freeway 1.

At τ=7, occupied, so if we are on y=7 at τ=7, collision!\n\nProblem at τ=7.\n\ny_7=7, freeway 7 occupied at τ=7.\n\nCannot be there.\n\nSimilarly, if we continue:\n\na_7: U, y_8=8\n\nBut at τ=7, we are on y_7=7, which is occupied.\n\nSo collision at τ=7.\n\nThus, all-up path has collision at τ=7 when on y=7.\n\nWe need to avoid that.\n\nPossible actions: at some point, we might stay or go down to avoid being on a bad freeway at a bad time.\n\nSince we want minimal H, we should try to reach as fast as possible.\n\nH=9 might be possible if we adjust the timing.\n\nFor example, if we delay reaching y=7 until after τ=8, since k=7 occupied only τ=6,7,8.\n\nSimilarly, other constraints.\n\nWe start from bottom.\n\ny=0 at τ=0.\n\nWe need to go up.\n\nBut freeways k=3,4,5 are occupied at τ=0,1,2, so we cannot be on k=3,4,5 during τ=0,1,2.\n\nAt τ=0, we are at y=0, not on them.\n\nAt τ=1, if we are on y=1, which is k=1, not occupied, ok.\n\nBut k=3,4,5 are occupied, so we must not be on y=3,4,5 at τ=1.\n\nSimilarly at τ=2, not on y=3,4,5,6? k=6 occupied at τ=2, so cannot be on y=6 at τ=2.\n\nk=6 occ only τ=2.\n\nNow, for all-up, we are on y=3 at τ=3, but k=3 occ only τ=0,1,2, not τ=3, so it was safe, but the problem was at τ=7.\n\nTo avoid collision at τ=7 on y=7, we need to not be on y=7 at τ=6,7,8.\n\nSince k=7 occupied τ=6,7,8.\n\nSo at τ=6,7,8, we cannot be on y=7.\n\nIn the all-up path, at τ=6, y=6; τ=7, y=7 (bad); τ=8, y=8.\n\nBut y=8 at τ=8 might be ok, but y=7 at τ=7 bad.\n\nWe need to be not on y=7 during τ=6,7,8.\n\nPossible: we can be below or above.\n\nFor example, at τ=6, if we are on y=6 or lower, or y=8 or higher, but since we are going up, probably lower.\n\nWe can delay going up or something.\n\nSince minimal H is 9, let's see if we can reach y=9 by τ=9 without being on y=7 at τ=6,7,8.\n\ny_τ at τ=6,7,8 must not be 7.\n\nNow, y_τ changes by at most 1 each step.\n\nStart y_0=0.\n\nAfter 6 steps, y_6 can be from 0 to 6, depending on actions.\n\nSimilarly, y_9=9.\n\nThe position at τ=6: if we have gone up some times.\n\nLet u be number of U, d number of D, s number of S, but since we need to increase by 9, and time H, we have u - d = 9, and u + d + s = H, so H = u + d + s >= u + d, and u - d =9, so H >= 9 + 2d, so minimal when d=0, H=9 if s=0.\n\nBut if we have to detour, d>0, H>9.\n\nBut for H=9, we must have u=9, d=0, s=0, so always up, but we saw it causes collision at τ=7.\n\nSo H=9 not possible with all up.\n\nBut with different timing, but with all up, we reach y=τ at τ, so y_6=6, y_7=7, y_8=8, y_9=9.\n\nAt τ=7, y=7 occupied.\n\nIf we start later, but we start at τ=0, we have to act from there.\n\nPerhaps we can stay at y=0 for some time, but that increases H.\n\nFor example, if we stay at τ=0, y=0, then at τ=1, still y=0 if S, or y=1 if U.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nTo avoid y=7 at τ=7, we need y_7 ≠7.\n\nSimilarly, for τ=6 and τ=8, but y_6 and y_8 might be ok if not 7.\n\nBut at τ=6, if y_6=7, occupied, so we need y_6 ≠7, y_7 ≠7, y_8 ≠7.\n\nFor freeway 7, occupied at τ=6,7,8, so we cannot have y_τ=7 for τ=6,7,8.\n\nNow, for H=9, we need to reach y=9 at τ=9.\n\ny_9=9.\n\ny_0=0.\n\nThe sequence y_τ for τ=0 to 9.\n\ny_τ must be integer 0 to 9.\n\ny_{τ+1} = y_τ + Δy, |Δy|<=1.\n\ny_9=9, y_0=0.\n\nThe difference: y_9 - y_0 =9, so sum of Δy from τ=0 to 8 must be +9.\n\nEach Δy = +1,0,-1.\n\nNumber of U minus number of D =9.\n\nTotal actions from τ=0 to 8, 9 actions to reach y_9.\n\ny_τ at τ, after action at τ, y_{τ+1} set.\n\nAt τ=0, y_0=0.\n\nAfter a_0, y_1 set.\n\nAfter a_8, y_9 set.\n\nSo actions a_0 to a_8 for H=9 turns, from τ=0 to 8, y_9=9.\n\ny_τ for τ=0 to 8.\n\nAt each τ, for y_τ in 1-8, must not be occupied at τ.\n\nNow, constraints:\n\nAt τ=0: y_0=0, safe.\n\nMust not be on k=3,4,5 at τ=0,1,2: so y_τ not 3,4,5 for τ=1,2? At τ=0, y_0=0 not 3,4,5.\n\nAt τ=1, y_1 must not be 3,4,5 because occupied.\n\nSimilarly at τ=2, y_2 must not be 3,4,5, and also not 6 because k=6 occupied at τ=2.\n\nk=6 occ only τ=2, so at τ=2, y_2 must not be 6.\n\nAlso, at τ=6,7,8, y_τ must not be 7.\n\nNow, for H=9, we need to reach y_9=9.\n\ny_0=0.\n\nSuppose we try to go up as much as possible but avoid the constraints.\n\nAt τ=1, y_1 must not be 3,4,5. Since y_0=0, y_1 can be 0,1 (if S or U, not D since y=0).\n\ny_1 cannot be 3,4,5, but at τ=1, y_1 is at most 1, so y_1=0 or 1, both not 3,4,5, so ok. Similarly, y_1 cannot be 6, but 6>1, impossible, so no issue.\n\nAt τ=1, y_1 must be 0 or 1, both safe since not 3,4,5 and k=1 not occupied at τ=1.\n\nSimilarly, at τ=2, y_2 must not be 3,4,5,6.\n\ny_2 can be 0,1,2 (from previous).\n\nIf y_1=0, y_2 could be 0,1 (S or U)\n\nIf y_1=1, y_2 could be 0,1,2 (D,S,U)\n\nBut y_2 must not be 3,4,5,6, but since max y_2=2, it can only be 0,1,2, all fine, not 3,4,5,6.\n\nSo at τ=2, no problem since y_2 <=2 <3.\n\nNow, at τ=6,7,8, y_τ must not be 7.\n\nFor H=9, y_9=9.\n\nWe need to have y_7 ≠7 and y_8 ≠7? y_8 at τ=8.\n\ny_τ at τ=6,7,8 must not be 7.\n\nIn all-up, y_6=6, y_7=7, y_8=8.\n\ny_7=7 is bad.\n\nWe need y_7 ≠7.\n\nSince y_6 and y_8 are different, y_7 could be 6,7,8.\n\nBut we need y_7 ≠7.\n\nSo y_7 must be 6 or 8.\n\nSimilarly, y_6 must not be 7, but in all-up y_6=6≠7, ok.\n\ny_8 must not be 7, but y_8=8≠7, ok.\n\nOnly y_7 must not be 7.\n\nSo for H=9, we need y_7=6 or 8.\n\nBut y_7=8 would require that at τ=7, y_7=8, which means that from y_6, we went up, but y_7=8, then at τ=7, we are on y_7=8, freeway 8.\n\nIs it occupied? k=8 occ at τ=12-14, not τ=7, so safe, but we are at τ=7.\n\ny_7=8 at τ=7, k=8 not occupied, ok.\n\nBut can we reach y_7=8?\n\ny_0=0, after 7 steps, y_7 = number of U minus number of D in first 7 actions.\n\ny_7 must be 8 or 6 for no collision at τ=7.\n\nBut we need y_9=9, so if y_7=8, then we need to go up once more to y_8=9, but y_9=9 if we stay or something.\n\ny_9=9, so after a_8, y_9=9.\n\nIf y_7=8, then we can go up to y_8=9, then stay or something, but at τ=8, y_8=9, not freeway, safe.\n\nSimilarly, if y_7=6, then we need to go up three times to reach y_9=9? y_7=6, y_8=7, but at τ=8, y_8=7, freeway 7 occupied at τ=8, collision!\n\nIf y_7=6, then to reach y_9=9, we need to increase by 3 in two steps: possible with U,U, so y_8=7, y_9=8? y_9=8, but we need y_9=9.\n\ny_7=6, y_8=7 (if U), then y_9=8 (if U again), but y_9=8, not 9.\n\nTo reach y_9=9 from y_7=6, need three up in two steps, impossible.\n\ny_7 to y_9: actions at τ=7 and τ=8.\n\na_7: Δy to y_8\n\na_8: Δy to y_9\n\nSo y_9 = y_7 + Δy_7 + Δy_8\n\nEach Δy <=1, so y_9 <= y_7 +2\n\nSimilarly y_9 >= y_7 -2\n\nBut y_9=9, so y_7 >=7, since if y_7=6, max y_9=8<9.\n\nSimilarly, if y_7=7, max y_9=9 if U,U.\n\nIf y_7=8, max y_9=9 if U or S.\n\nBut earlier, for no collision at τ=7, we need y_7 ≠7, so y_7=6 or 8.\n\nBut if y_7=6, then y_9 <=8<9, impossible.\n\nTherefore, for H=9, y_7 must be 8, so that y_9=9 is possible with y_8=9 or something.\n\ny_7=8, then y_9 = y_7 + Δy_7 + Δy_8 = 8 + Δy_7 + Δy_8\n\nSet to 9, so Δy_7 + Δy_8 =1.\n\nPossible: e.g., Δy_7=0, Δy_8=1: y_8=8, y_9=9\n\nOr Δy_7=1, Δy_8=0: y_8=9, y_9=9\n\nOr Δy_7=1, Δy_8=-1: y_8=9, y_9=8 not 9\n\nBetter to have y_8=9, y_9=9 with a_8=S.\n\nNow, back to y_7=8.\n\nWe need y_7=8 for H=9 to be possible without collision at τ=7.\n\ny_7=8 at τ=7.\n\nNow, we need to reach y_7=8 from y_0=0 in 7 steps (actions a_0 to a_6).\n\ny_7 = y_0 + sum_{i=0}^6 Δy_i = 0 + sum of 7 actions.\n\nEach Δy = +1,0,-1.\n\ny_7=8, so sum of Δy from 0 to 6 must be +8.\n\nNumber of U minus number of D =8, with 7 actions.\n\nLet u be number of U, d number of D, s number of S in first 7 actions.\n\nu + d + s =7\n\nu - d =8?

Let's list y_τ.\n\nAt τ=0 (turn 36): y=0\n\nAfter a_0=U: y_1=1 (for turn 37)\n\nAt τ=1 (turn 37): y=1, after a_1=U, y_2=2\n\nτ=2 (t=38): y=2, a_2=U, y_3=3\n\nτ=3 (t=39): y=3, a_3=U, y_4=4\n\nτ=4 (t=40): y=4, a_4=U, y_5=5\n\nτ=5 (t=41): y=5, a_5=U, y_6=6\n\nNow at τ=6 (t=42): y=6, we need to avoid going to y=7 immediately.\n\nAction a_6: S, so y_7=6\n\nAt τ=7 (t=43): y=6 (since y_7=6), action a_7: S, so y_8=6\n\nAt τ=8 (t=44): y=6, action a_8: U, so y_9=7\n\nAt τ=9 (t=45): y=7, action a_9: U, so y_10=8\n\nAt τ=10 (t=46): y=8, action a_10: U, so y_11=9\n\nNow, check positions at each turn:\n\nAt turn τ=0 (t=36): y=0, safe\n\nτ=1 (t=37): y=1, k=1 not occ, safe\n\nτ=2 (t=38): y=2, k=2 not occ, safe\n\nτ=3 (t=39): y=3, k=3 occ at τ=0,1,2? τ=3, not occ, safe\n\nτ=4 (t=40): y=4, k=4 not occ, safe\n\nτ=5 (t=41): y=5, k=5 not occ, safe\n\nτ=6 (t=42): y=6, k=6 not occ at τ=6 (occ only τ=2), safe\n\nτ=7 (t=43): y=6, k=6 not occ, safe\n\nτ=8 (t=44): y=6, k=6 not occ, safe\n\nτ=9 (t=45): y=7, k=7 occ at τ=6,7,8? τ=9, not occ, safe\n\nτ=10 (t=46): y=8, k=8 not occ, safe\n\nAnd after action at t=46, y=9.\n\nWe reached in 11 turns.\n\nIs this minimal? H=11.\n\nEarlier H=9 and 10 impossible, so yes.\n\nBut in the sequence, at τ=6,7,8 we stayed at y=6, which is safe.\n\nThen went up.\n\nCould we go to y=8 earlier? But we cannot because of the speed.\n\nFor example, if we go up faster, but we started from y=0, and at τ=5 we are at y=5, then up to y=6 at τ=6.\n\nCannot be higher.\n\nAfter the critical period, we go up.\n\nAnother way: at τ=6, we are at y=6, instead of staying, we could go down to y=5, but that would take more time to recover, so H larger.\n\nStaying is better.\n\nGo to y=8 after, but we did.\n\nSo H=11 seems minimal.\n\nNow, the actions:\n\nFor turn t_1 + t, t from 0 to H-1.\n\nt_1=36.\n\nH=11, so t from 0 to 10.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 36: a_{36} = U\n\nTurn 37: a_{37} = U\n\nTurn 38: a_{38} = U\n\nTurn 39: a_{39} = U\n\nTurn 40: a_{40} = U\n\nTurn 41: a_{41} = U  // to y=6 at turn 42?

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get the player from (0,0) at turn 42 to (0,9) as quickly as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. The player moves up, down, or stays each turn, changing y by +1, -1, or 0. I must find the minimal H and the sequence of actions.\n\nFirst, I should understand the car movements. Cars move left or right with given speeds, and their positions change linearly over time. Collision happens only if at some turn T, the player is on a freeway y and there's a car on that freeway where 0 is in its span at that exact turn.\n\nA key point is that when the player moves to a new row, they are not on that row during the move turn; they only occupy the new row starting the next turn. So if I move from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T I'm still on y, and at turn T+1 I'm on y+1. Therefore, I don't collide with cars on y+1 at turn T, only from turn T+1 onwards.\n\nNow, looking at the car states:\n\n- Freeway 1: one car, (-48,-59, right, 4). Since it's right-moving, the head is at the right, so span is [τ, h] = [-59, -48]? No, let's read carefully.\n\nThe notation says: for right-moving, span(t1) = [τ, h], and at time T, span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)].\n\nIn the table, it says \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\".\n\nI think there might be confusion in terminology. Let me parse this.\n\nFor a right-moving car, it says span(t1) = [τ, h], which might imply τ is left end, h is right end? But in the update, for right-moving, span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)], so as time increases, both ends increase, meaning the car is moving right.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)], so both ends decrease, moving left.\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 1: (-48, -59, right, 4)\n\nNow, span at t1: since right-moving, span(t1) = [τ, h] = [-59, -48]? But -59 is less than -48, so [ -59, -48 ] would be from left to right, but since it's moving right, τ should be the tail, which is left, and h head, which is right.\n\nThe notation says: \"head h, tail τ\". So for right-moving, head is the right end, tail is left end, so span is [tail, head] = [τ, h].\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, it says span(t1) = [h, τ], but in the update it's different.\n\nLet's read the car update rules carefully.\n\n\"Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\"\n\nIt says Span(t1) = [h, τ], but for left-moving, if h is head and τ is tail, and it's moving left, head should be left, I think.\n\nI think there's inconsistency in the notation.\n\nPerhaps h and τ are always defined such that for left-moving, h is the front, which is left, and τ is rear, so span is [h, τ] with h < τ for left-moving? But in the example, for freeway 6, it has (48,83,left,36), and 48 to 83, if left-moving, it should be decreasing, but 48 to 83 is increasing if we think of coordinates.\n\nI think I need to interpret the coordinates properly.\n\nAssume the freeway is a number line, with position increasing to the right.\n\nFor a car:\n\n- If right-moving, it has tail (left end) and head (right end), so at time t, position from tail to head, both increase when moving right.\n\n- If left-moving, head is left end, tail is right end, so span from head to tail, both decrease when moving left.\n\nIn the state description:\n\nFor freeway 1: (-48, -59, right, 4)\n\nSince right-moving, tail τ = -59, head h = -48? But -59 is less than -48, so tail at -59, head at -48, so the car spans from -59 to -48 at t1.\n\nThen at time T, span = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] = [-59 + 4(T-42), -48 + 4(T-42)]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFor left-moving, like freeway 6: (48,83,left,36)\n\nIt says head h, tail τ, so for left-moving, h = 48, τ = 83, but 48 to 83, if left-moving, head should be at 48, tail at 83? But 48 < 83, so if moving left, head at 48, tail at 83 doesn't make sense because tail should be behind.\n\nI think there's a mistake in my interpretation.\n\nLet's read the car update rule for left-moving:\n\n\"Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\"\n\nAnd in the state, it's given as (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\n\nFor left-moving, if span(t1) = [h, τ], and it moves left, so h and τ both decrease.\n\nIn the example, freeway 6: (48,83,left,36), so h=48, τ=83, span at t1 is [48,83].\n\nBut 48 to 83, if moving left, at later time, positions decrease, so the car is moving left, meaning at t1, head is at 48 (left end), tail at 83 (right end), so the car is from 48 to 83, but since it's moving left, the head at 48 will move to smaller numbers, tail at 83 to smaller, so the car is positioned with left at 48, right at 83, and moving left, so left end decreases, right end decreases.\n\nBut typically, for a left-moving car, we think of it facing left, so front is left, back is right.\n\nIn terms of span, the occupied positions are from min to max, but the direction indicates how it moves.\n\nFor collision, we care about whether 0 is in the span at time T.\n\nSimilarly for other cars.\n\nLet's list all cars at t1=42.\n\nt1=42\n\nFreeway 1: one car, right-moving, h=-48, τ=-59? τ is tail, h is head.\n\nFrom the notation: (head h, tail τ, d, s)\n\nFor right-moving, head is right, tail is left, so span [tail, head] = [τ, h]\n\nIn this case, τ=-59, h=-48, so span at t1: [-59, -48]\n\nSpeed 4, right-moving.\n\nAt time T, span: [ -59 + 4(T-42), -48 + 4(T-42) ]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same as freeway 1? (-48, -59, right, 4), so identical to freeway 1.\n\nFreeway 3: two cars: (48,37,right,4) and (0,-11,right,4)\n\nFirst car: head 48, tail 37? For right-moving, tail should be left, head right, but 37 to 48, tail 37, head 48, so span [37,48] at t1.\n\n(48,37,right,4) — if head=48, tail=37, and right-moving, so tail at 37, head at 48, so car from 37 to 48.\n\nSimilarly, second car: (0,-11,right,4), head=0, tail=-11, so span [-11,0] at t1.\n\nBoth right-moving, speed 4.\n\nFreeway 4: same as freeway 3? (48,37,right,4), (0,-11,right,4)\n\nFreeway 5: same, (48,37,right,4), (0,-11,right,4)\n\nFreeway 6: one car, (48,83,left,36)\n\nLeft-moving, so head h=48, tail τ=83, and for left-moving, span(t1) = [h, τ] = [48,83]\n\nThen at T, span = [48 - 36(T-42), 83 - 36(T-42)]\n\nFreeway 7: three cars: (48,37,right,4), (12,1,right,4), (-24,-35,right,4)\n\nAll right-moving.\n\nFirst: head48, tail37, span [37,48]\n\nSecond: head12, tail1, span [1,12]\n\nThird: head -24, tail -35, span [-35,-24]\n\nFreeway 8: (-48,-59,right,4), same as freeway 1 and 2.\n\nNow, player starts at (0,0) at t1=42, needs to reach (0,9).\n\ny=0 is not a freeway, I think, since freeways are y=1 to 8, so at y=0, no cars, similarly y=9 is the goal, no cars.\n\nThe vertical axis y=0 to 9, freeways for cars are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nPlayer is at (0,0) at turn 42.\n\nWe need to move to (0,9), so we need to change y from 0 to 9.\n\nEach action changes y by -1,0,+1, but y is clamped to [0,9], so we can't go below 0 or above 9.\n\nSince we start at 0 and need to go to 9, we probably want to go up, but we have to avoid the freeways when cars are at position 0.\n\nCollision: at turn T, if player is on freeway k (y_T = k, for k=1 to 8), and for that freeway, there is a car where 0 is in its span at that turn T.\n\nThe player is on a freeway only when y_T is between 1 and 8 inclusive.\n\nAt turn T, position is (0, y_T), and if y_T in 1-8, then we check if for that freeway, any car has 0 in its span at T.\n\nIf we move, at the turn we move, we are still on the starting row.\n\nFor example, at turn T, if we do U, then y_{T+1} = y_T +1, so at turn T, we are on y_T, and at turn T+1, we are on y_T+1.\n\nSimilarly for D or S.\n\nTo minimize turns, we want to go up as fast as possible, but we might need to wait or go down to avoid cars.\n\nFirst, since we need to go from 0 to 9, and each U increases y by 1, minimum turns if we go straight up: 9 actions of U, so H=9 turns, from t=42 to 50, y=0 to 9.\n\nBut we need to check if at any point, when on y=1 to 8, there is a car at position 0.\n\nSo let's simulate that.\n\nPlayer actions: all U, so at turn t, y_t = (t - 42) for t from 42 to 50, y=0 to 9? Let's see:\n\nt=42: y=0 (start, not on freeway)\n\nAction U\n\nt=43: y=1\n\nNow on freeway 1 at t=43.\n\nCheck freeway 1 at t=43.\n\nFreeway 1 has car: right-moving, span at T: [ -59 + 4(T-42), -48 + 4(T-42) ]\n\nAt T=43, T-42=1, so span: [ -59 +4, -48 +4] = [-55, -44]\n\n0 is not in [-55,-44], since -55 to -44, all negative, 0 not inside. So no collision.\n\nAction U\n\nt=44: y=2\n\nOn freeway 2 at t=44.\n\nFreeway 2 car: same as freeway 1, (-48,-59,right,4), span at T=44: T-42=2, [ -59 +8, -48+8] = [-51,-40], 0 not in, safe.\n\nAction U\n\nt=45: y=3\n\nOn freeway 3 at t=45.\n\nFreeway 3 has two cars.\n\nFirst car: (48,37,right,4), span at T: [37 +4(T-42), 48 +4(T-42)]\n\nAt T=45, T-42=3, [37+12, 48+12] = [49,60], not including 0.\n\nSecond car: (0,-11,right,4), span: [-11 +4(T-42), 0 +4(T-42)] = [-11 +4ΔT, 4ΔT] where ΔT=T-42.\n\nAt T=45, ΔT=3, [-11+12, 0+12] = [1,12], which includes 0? 0 is at the boundary.\n\n[1,12], from 1 to 12, 0 is not included, since 1>0. So 0 not in [1,12], safe.\n\nAction U\n\nt=46: y=4\n\nOn freeway 4 at t=46.\n\nFreeway 4 same as freeway 3: cars (48,37,right,4) and (0,-11,right,4)\n\nAt T=46, ΔT=4\n\nFirst car: [37+16, 48+16] = [53,64], no 0\n\nSecond car: [-11+16, 0+16] = [5,16], 0 not in, safe.\n\nAction U\n\nt=47: y=5\n\nOn freeway 5 at t=47, same cars as above.\n\nAt T=47, ΔT=5\n\nFirst car: [37+20,48+20]=[57,68], no\n\nSecond car: [-11+20,0+20]=[9,20], 0 not in, safe.\n\nAction U\n\nt=48: y=6\n\nOn freeway 6 at t=48.\n\nFreeway 6: one car, left-moving, (48,83,left,36)\n\nh=48, τ=83, left-moving, span at T: [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)] = [48 - 36(ΔT), 83 - 36(ΔT)] with ΔT=T-42\n\nAt T=48, ΔT=6\n\nSpan: [48 - 36*6, 83 - 36*6] = [48 - 216, 83 - 216] = [-168, -133], both negative, 0 not in, safe.\n\nAction U\n\nt=49: y=7\n\nOn freeway 7 at t=49.\n\nFreeway 7 has three cars: (48,37,right,4), (12,1,right,4), (-24,-35,right,4)\n\nAll right-moving.\n\nAt T=49, ΔT=7\n\nFirst car: (48,37,right,4) span: [37 +4*7, 48+4*7] = [37+28,48+28]=[65,76], no 0\n\nSecond car: (12,1,right,4) span: [1 +28, 12+28] = [29,40], no 0\n\nThird car: (-24,-35,right,4) span: [-35 +28, -24+28] = [-7,4], now [-7,4] includes 0? -7 to 4, 0 is between -7 and 4, so yes, 0 is in the span.\n\nAt T=49, on freeway 7, car 3 has span [-7,4], which contains 0, so collision if we are on y=7 at t=49.\n\nBut we are on y=7 at t=49, so collision occurs.\n\nTherefore, going straight up causes collision at t=49 on freeway 7.\n\nSo we cannot go straight up; we need to avoid this.\n\nMinimal H might be more than 9, or we might need to take a different path.\n\nPerhaps wait or go down to avoid the collision.\n\nNow, the collision is at t=49 on y=7 with the third car on freeway 7.\n\nCar: (-24,-35,right,4), at t1=42, span [-35,-24]\n\nAt T, span [-35 +4(ΔT), -24 +4(ΔT)] with ΔT=T-42\n\n0 in span when -35 +4ΔT <= 0 <= -24 +4ΔT\n\nSince -35 +4ΔT <= 0 <= -24 +4ΔT\n\nFirst inequality: -35 +4ΔT <=0 => 4ΔT <=35 => ΔT <= 35/4 = 8.75\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= -24 +4ΔT => 4ΔT >=24 => ΔT >=6\n\nSo for ΔT from 6 to 8.75, since ΔT integer, ΔT=6,7,8,9? ΔT=6: -35+24= -11? Let's compute:\n\nΔT=6: -35 + 4*6 = -35+24= -11, -24+24=0, so span [-11,0], which includes 0.\n\nΔT=7: -35+28= -7, -24+28=4, span [-7,4], includes 0.\n\nΔT=8: -35+32= -3, -24+32=8, span [-3,8], includes 0.\n\nΔT=9: -35+36=1, -24+36=12, span [1,12], 0 not included.\n\nΔT=10: [-35+40, -24+40]=[5,16], no.\n\nSo at ΔT=6,7,8, which is T=48,49,50, the car covers position 0.\n\nT=48: ΔT=6, span [-11,0]\n\nT=49: ΔT=7, span [-7,4]\n\nT=50: ΔT=8, span [-3,8]\n\nAll include 0.\n\nAt T=51, ΔT=9, span [1,12], no 0.\n\nNow, back to the player.\n\nTo reach y=9, we need to be at y=9 at some turn.\n\nSince we start at y=0, t=42, and need to get to y=9.\n\nThe collision on y=7 happens at t=48,49,50 for that car, but we are concerned when we are on y=7.\n\nIf we can avoid being on y=7 during t=48,49,50, or at those times.\n\nBut we might be on y=7 at other times.\n\nFirst, let's see the critical points.\n\nWe might need to delay or advance our arrival on certain rows.\n\nSince going straight up causes collision at t=49 on y=7, we could, for example, at some point, stay or go down to avoid being on y=7 at that time.\n\nBut we need to get to y=9.\n\nAnother idea: go up to some point, then stay or down, then up again.\n\nBut we want minimal turns, so we should minimize waiting.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway, when position 0 is occupied by a car.\n\nFor each freeway, the times when 0 is in some car's span.\n\nThen, for the player, when on that freeway at that time, collision.\n\nSo we need that for each time T and freeway k, if player is on k at T, then no car on k has 0 in span at T.\n\nSince we control the player's movement, we can choose when to be on which row.\n\nNow, let's list for each freeway, the time intervals when 0 is covered.\n\nt1=42.\n\nFreeway 1: car span at T: [-59 +4(ΔT), -48 +4(ΔT)] with ΔT=T-42\n\n0 in span: -59 +4ΔT <= 0 <= -48 +4ΔT\n\nLeft: -59 +4ΔT <=0 => 4ΔT <=59 => ΔT <= 14.75\n\nRight: 0 <= -48 +4ΔT => 4ΔT >=48 => ΔT >=12\n\nSo for ΔT from 12 to 14.75, integer ΔT=12,13,14\n\nT=42+12=54, T=55, T=56\n\nAt T=54: ΔT=12, span [-59+48, -48+48] = [-11,0], includes 0\n\nT=55: [-59+52, -48+52] = [-7,4], includes 0\n\nT=56: [-59+56, -48+56] = [-3,8], includes 0\n\nT=57: [-59+60, -48+60] = [1,12], no 0\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2 same as freeway 1, since same car configuration.\n\nFreeway 3: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (48,37,right,4), span [37 +4ΔT, 48+4ΔT]\n\n0 in this? 37 +4ΔT <=0 <=48+4ΔT? But 37+4ΔT >=37>0 for ΔT>=0, so always positive, never <=0, so 0 not in span. Min is 37 at ΔT=0, so always >0, no.\n\nSecond car: (0,-11,right,4), span [-11 +4ΔT, 0 +4ΔT] = [4ΔT -11, 4ΔT]\n\n0 in span: 4ΔT -11 <= 0 <= 4ΔT\n\nSince 0 <= 4ΔT always true for ΔT>=0, and 4ΔT -11 <=0 => 4ΔT <=11 => ΔT <= 2.75\n\nAlso, since span is [4ΔT-11, 4ΔT], 0 in if 4ΔT-11 <=0 and 0 <=4ΔT, but 0<=4ΔT true, so only 4ΔT-11 <=0 => ΔT <= 2.75, so ΔT=0,1,2\n\nT=42: ΔT=0, span [-11,0], includes 0\n\nT=43: ΔT=1, [-11+4,0+4]=[-7,4], includes 0\n\nT=44: ΔT=2, [-11+8,0+8]=[-3,8], includes 0\n\nT=45: ΔT=3, [1,12], no 0\n\nSo for freeway 3, second car covers 0 at T=42,43,44.\n\nBut at t=42, player is at y=0, not on freeway, so no collision even if car covers 0, because player not on the freeway.\n\nCollision only when player is on the freeway and car covers 0.\n\nAt T=42, player at y=0, not on freeway, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, T=43 and T=44, if player on freeway 3, collision.\n\nIn our straight path, we were on y=3 at t=45, which is after, so safe.\n\nNow freeway 4: same as freeway 3, cars (48,37,right,4) and (0,-11,right,4), so same times: car covers 0 at T=42,43,44.\n\nSimilarly freeway 5 same.\n\nFreeway 6: left-moving car (48,83,left,36), span at T: [48 -36ΔT, 83 -36ΔT]\n\n0 in span: 48 -36ΔT <= 0 <= 83 -36ΔT\n\nFirst, 48 -36ΔT <=0 => 36ΔT >=48 => ΔT >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈1.333\n\nSecond, 0 <= 83 -36ΔT => 36ΔT <=83 => ΔT <= 83/36 ≈2.305\n\nSo ΔT from 1.333 to 2.305, integer ΔT=2 only? ΔT=2: 48-72= -24, 83-72=11, span [-24,11], includes 0\n\nΔT=1: 48-36=12, 83-36=47, span [12,47], 0 not in\n\nΔT=2: [48-72,83-72]=[-24,11], includes 0\n\nΔT=3: [48-108,83-108]=[-60,-25], no 0\n\nSo only at ΔT=2, T=44, freeway 6 has car covering 0.\n\nAt T=44, if on y=6, collision.\n\nFreeway 7: three cars.\n\nFirst car: (48,37,right,4), span [37+4ΔT,48+4ΔT], min 37>0, never covers 0.\n\nSecond car: (12,1,right,4), span [1+4ΔT,12+4ΔT], min 1>0, never covers 0.\n\nThird car: (-24,-35,right,4), span [-35+4ΔT, -24+4ΔT]\n\n0 in: -35+4ΔT <=0 <= -24+4ΔT\n\nAs before, 4ΔT <=35 => ΔT <=8.75\n\n4ΔT >=24 => ΔT >=6\n\nSo ΔT=6,7,8 for T=48,49,50\n\nCovers 0.\n\nFreeway 8: same as freeway 1, car (-48,-59,right,4), so covers 0 at T=54,55,56 as freeway 1.\n\nNow, summary of dangerous times for each freeway:\n\n- y=1: dangerous at T=54,55,56\n\n- y=2: same, T=54,55,56\n\n- y=3: dangerous at T=43,44 (from second car)\n\n- y=4: dangerous at T=43,44\n\n- y=5: dangerous at T=43,44\n\n- y=6: dangerous only at T=44\n\n- y=7: dangerous at T=48,49,50\n\n- y=8: dangerous at T=54,55,56\n\nNow, player starts at t=42, y=0.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nThe goal is to be at y=9 at some turn, and since y=9 is safe, we can be there.\n\nMinimal H: if we go up as fast as possible, but avoiding the collisions.\n\nIn the straight path, we had collision at t=49 on y=7.\n\nWe need to avoid being on y=7 at t=48,49,50.\n\nSince we start at t=42 y=0, and go up, we reach y=7 at some turn.\n\nIf we go all U, we reach y=7 at t=49.\n\nBut t=49 is dangerous.\n\nWe could reach y=7 earlier or later.\n\nFor example, if we go faster, but we start from y=0, and each U increases by 1, so from y=0 to y=7, minimum 7 actions, so at turn t=42 + k, y=k, so to be at y=7 at turn t, we need at least t-42 actions to increase from 0 to 7, but we might have stays or downs.\n\nThe earliest we can be at y=7 is t=49, with 7 U actions from t=42 to 48: let's see.\n\nAt t=42: y=0\n\nAfter action at t=42: if U, then t=43 y=1\n\nSimilarly, after U at t=43, t=44 y=2\n\n...\n\nAfter U at t=48, t=49 y=7\n\nSo y=7 at t=49.\n\nIf we do nothing at some point, we delay.\n\nOr if we go down, we go to lower y.\n\nBut to reach y=9, we need net +9 in y.\n\nEach U: +1, D: -1, S:0.\n\nTo minimize time, we want to minimize the number of S or D, since they don't increase y.\n\nIdeally, only U actions, but we might need to wait or detour.\n\nNow, for y=7, dangerous at t=48,49,50.\n\nt=48: y=7 at t=48? How?\n\nTo be at y=7 at t=48, we need to have increased from y=0 at t=42 to y=7 at t=48.\n\nIn 6 turns? From t=42 to t=48, there are 6 actions: actions at t=42 to t=47 determine y at t=48.\n\ny at t=48 depends on actions from t=42 to t=47.\n\nLet y_t be position at turn t.\n\ny_{t} = y_{t-1} + Δy_{t-1} for t>42, with y_42=0.\n\nΔy depends on action at previous turn.\n\nAt turn t, we take action a_t, which determines Δy_t, so y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nSo at turn t, position y_t.\n\nAfter action a_t, y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nFor example:\n\nt=42: position y=0, take action a_42, then y_43 = y_42 + Δy_42\n\nSimilarly, at t=43, y_43, take a_43, y_44 = y_43 + Δy_43, etc.\n\nTo have y_t = k for some t.\n\nSpecifically, to be at y=7 at turn T.\n\ny_T = 7.\n\nSince y_42=0, the sum of Δy from t=42 to t=T-1 must be 7.\n\nEach Δy is -1,0,1.\n\nNumber of U minus number of D from t=42 to t=T-1 should be 7, and number of actions is (T-1) - 42 + 1 = T - 42.\n\nLet N = T - 42, the number of actions from t=42 to t=41+N.\n\nActions at times: t=42,43,44,..., up to t=41 + N for N actions.\n\nAfter N actions, time is t=42 + N, position y_{42+N}.\n\ny_{42} = 0\n\nAfter action at t=42, y_{43} = 0 + Δy_{42}\n\nAfter action at t=43, y_{44} = y_{43} + Δy_{43} = Δy_{42} + Δy_{43}\n\n...\n\nAfter action at t=42 + K -1, y_{42+K} = sum_{i=0}^{K-1} Δy_{42+i}\n\nAnd y_{42+K} = position at turn t=42+K.\n\nTo have y_{42+K} = 7, sum of first K actions Δy must be 7.\n\nSimilarly, to be at turn T, y_T =7, so T = 42 + K for some K, and y_{42+K} =7.\n\nK is the number of actions taken from t=42 to t=41+K? Let's index.\n\nTurn at time t, position y_t.\n\ny_{t} for t=42,43,...\n\ny_t = sum_{i=42}^{t-1} Δy_i ? y_{t} = y_{42} + sum_{i=42}^{t-1} Δy_i\n\nSince y_{42} =0, y_t = sum_{i=42}^{t-1} Δy_i\n\nFor t=42, y_42 =0, no sum.\n\nFor t=43, y_43 = Δy_{42}\n\nFor t=44, y_44 = Δy_{42} + Δy_{43}\n\n...\n\nFor t = 42 + M, y_{42+M} = sum_{i=42}^{42+M-1} Δy_i = sum of Δy from i=42 to i=41+M\n\nLet S_M = sum of first M actions: actions at t=42 to t=42+M-1, affecting y at t=43 to t=42+M.\n\ny_{42} =0\n\nAfter M actions (at t=42 to t=41+M), position at t=42+M.\n\ny_{42+M} = sum_{k=0}^{M-1} Δy_{42+k}\n\nTo have y_T =7, set T = 42 + M, then y_{42+M} =7 = sum_{k=0}^{M-1} Δy_{42+k}\n\nThe number of actions to reach y=7 is at least 7, with all U.\n\nEarliest at T=42+7=49, with y_49=7.\n\nLatest, no bound, but we want minimal time to y=9.\n\nSimilarly for other rows.\n\nBack to y=7: dangerous at t=48,49,50.\n\nCan we be at y=7 at a different time?\n\nEarliest: t=49 with all U.\n\nLatest: we can delay.\n\nBut for t=48: to be at y=7 at t=48, y_48=7.\n\ny_48 = sum_{i=42}^{47} Δy_i =7\n\nNumber of actions: from t=42 to t=47, 6 actions.\n\nSum of 6 Δy must be 7, but each |Δy|<=1, so maximum sum is 6, cannot be 7. Impossible to be at y=7 at t=48.\n\nSimilarly, at t=47: y_47 = sum_{i=42}^{46} Δy_i, 5 actions, max sum 5, y_47 <=5 <7, impossible.\n\nt=46: y_46 <=4, etc.\n\nSo earliest possible at y=7 is t=49.\n\nAt t=50: y_50=7 possible, if we have some downs or stays.\n\nFor example, after reaching y=7 at t=49, we can stay or go down, but at t=50, if we are still at y=7.\n\nt=50 is dangerous for y=7.\n\nSimilarly, t=49 dangerous, t=50 dangerous.\n\nt=48 impossible for y=7.\n\nSo the only times we can be on y=7 are t=49 or later, but t=49 and t=50 are dangerous, so we must not be on y=7 at t=49 or t=50.\n\nTherefore, we cannot be on y=7 during t=48,49,50, but since t=48 impossible, we must avoid t=49 and t=50.\n\nSo we must be at y=7 only at t <49 or t>50.\n\nBut earliest t=49, so we cannot be at y=7 at t=49, which is the earliest possible, so we must delay being on y=7 until after t=50.\n\nSo we must be at y=7 at t=51 or later.\n\nSimilarly, for other rows.\n\nFirst, let's confirm: to be at y=7 at t=51.\n\ny_51 =7.\n\ny_51 = sum_{i=42}^{50} Δy_i =7\n\nNumber of actions from t=42 to t=50, 9 actions? Actions at t=42 to t=50 affect positions up to y_51.\n\ny_t = sum_{i=42}^{t-1} Δy_i\n\nFor t=51, y_51 = sum_{i=42}^{50} Δy_i\n\nNumber of terms: from i=42 to 50 inclusive, that's 9 terms.\n\nEach Δy -1,0,1, sum to 7.\n\nWith 9 actions, we can have sum=7, for example, 7 U and 2 S, or 8 U and 1 D, etc.\n\nSimilarly, we can be at y=7 at t=52, etc.\n\nBut we want minimal time to reach y=9, so we should not delay too much.\n\nNow, similarly, for other freeways, we need to check when we pass them.\n\nBut let's first handle y=7.\n\nSo we cannot be on y=7 at t=49 or t=50.\n\nSince t=49 is the earliest possible, we must reach y=7 no earlier than t=51.\n\nSimilarly, we need to reach y=9.\n\ny=9 at some T.\n\nMinimal T if no delays: t=51 for y=9? Start y=0 t=42, after 9 U: actions U from t=42 to t=50, y_51=9.\n\nBut with delays, later.\n\nBut we have to avoid other collisions.\n\nNow, also, for y=6, dangerous only at t=44.\n\nt=44: if on y=6 at t=44, collision.\n\nBut can we be on y=6 at t=44?\n\ny_44 = position at t=44.\n\ny_44 = sum_{i=42}^{43} Δy_i = Δy_42 + Δy_43\n\nFrom t=42 to t=43, two actions.\n\ny_44 = Δy_42 + Δy_43\n\nEach -1,0,1, so y_44 <=2, since max 2, but y=6>2, impossible to be at y=6 at t=44.\n\nSimilarly, t=45: y_45 = Δy_42 + Δy_43 + Δy_44, three terms, max y=3<6, impossible.\n\n...\n\nEarliest at y=6: with all U, at t=48: y_48 = sum_{i=42}^{47} Δy_i, 6 actions, y_48=6 if all U.\n\nt=48: actions at t=42 to t=47, y_48 = sum_{k=0}^{5} Δy_{42+k} , 6 terms.\n\nIf all U, y_48=6.\n\nt=48 is turn 48.\n\nNow, dangerous for y=6 only at t=44, but t=44 we cannot be on y=6, as above. Similarly, other times not dangerous, so y=6 is safe except at t=44, which we cannot reach anyway, so no problem for y=6.\n\nSimilarly, for y=3,4,5 dangerous at t=43,44.\n\nBut at t=43: y_43 = Δy_42, so y=0 or 1 or -1, but y>=0, so y=0 or 1, cannot be y=3,4,5.\n\nt=44: y_44= Δy_42 + Δy_43, max 2, cannot be 3,4,5.\n\nt=45: y_45 = Δy_42 + Δy_43 + Δy_44, max 3, so can be y=3, but not 4 or 5.\n\ny=3 possible at t=45, with all U: y_45=3.\n\nBut at t=45, y=3 is dangerous? Freeway 3 dangerous at t=43,44, but t=45 not dangerous, as we saw earlier, at t=45, freeway 3 car not covering 0.\n\nSimilarly, for y=4: earliest at t=46 with all U, y_46=4.\n\nDangerous at t=43,44, but t=46 not dangerous.\n\nSimilarly y=5 at t=47, dangerous times t=43,44, not t=47.\n\nSo for y=3,4,5, we can be on them after t=44, no problem.\n\nSimilarly for y=1 and y=2, dangerous at t=54,55,56.\n\nBut we will be on them earlier if we go up, but t=54 is later, we might have passed by then.\n\nFor example, with all U, we are on y=1 at t=43, y=2 at t=44, both before t=54, so not during dangerous times.\n\nSimilarly, y=8 dangerous at t=54,55,56.\n\nWith all U, we reach y=8 at t=50, which is before t=54, so safe.\n\nBut now with the y=7 problem.\n\nIn all U, we are at y=7 at t=49, which is dangerous, and we must avoid.\n\nSo we need to delay being on y=7 until t=51 or later.\n\nBut we also need to reach y=9.\n\nOne way: we can go up to y=6, then instead of going to y=7 at t=49, we stay or go down at t=48 or something.\n\nLet's plan the actions.\n\nStart at t=42, y=0.\n\nWe need to get to y=9 with minimal turns.\n\nSince we must not be on y=7 at t=49 or t=50, and we can be at t=51 or later.\n\nBut to minimize time, we should be at y=7 at t=51 if possible.\n\nSimilarly, we can go to other rows.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps go up to y=6, then at t=48, when we would go to y=7, instead we stay or go down to avoid, then later go up.\n\nBut let's see the times.\n\nFirst, let's go up as fast as possible until y=6.\n\nWith all U:\n\nt=42: y=0, action U → t=43 y=1\n\nt=43: y=1, action U → t=44 y=2\n\nt=44: y=2, action U → t=45 y=3\n\nt=45: y=3, action U → t=46 y=4\n\nt=46: y=4, action U → t=47 y=5\n\nt=47: y=5, action U → t=48 y=6\n\nNow at t=48, y=6.\n\nAction at t=48: if we do U, then t=49 y=7, but t=49 dangerous.\n\nIf we do S, then t=49 y=6, still on y=6.\n\nIf D, t=49 y=5.\n\nWe need to reach y=9, so we have to go up eventually.\n\nBut at t=49, if we are on y=6, is it safe? Freeway 6 dangerous only at t=44, which passed, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=5 safe.\n\nNow, the dangerous period for y=7 is t=48,49,50, but t=48 we are on y=6, not y=7.\n\nt=49: if we are not on y=7, safe.\n\nt=50: if not on y=7.\n\nWe can stay on y=6 for one or more turns.\n\nFor example, at t=48, y=6, instead of U, we do S.\n\nThen at t=49, y=6.\n\nNow at t=49, y=6, safe.\n\nThen action at t=49: we can do U to go to y=7 at t=50.\n\nBut at t=50, y=7 is dangerous, since t=50 is dangerous for y=7.\n\nIf we do U at t=49, y_{50} = y_{49} + Δy_{49} = 6 +1 =7, so at t=50, y=7.\n\nBut t=50, y=7, dangerous, collision.\n\nIf we do S at t=49, y=6 at t=50.\n\nThen at t=50, y=6, safe.\n\nThen action at t=50, we can do U to go to y=7 at t=51.\n\nt=51, y=7.\n\nNow t=51 is after t=50, and dangerous period ended at t=50, t=51 not dangerous for y=7, since at t=51, ΔT=9, car span [1,12], no 0.\n\nSo at t=51, y=7 is safe.\n\nThen we can go up to y=8 and y=9.\n\nBut let's see the time.\n\nFrom above:\n\nt=48: y=6, action S (stay)\n\nt=49: y=6, action S (stay again? Or we can do U, but if U, y=7 at t=50 dangerous.\n\nSo at t=49, we should not go to y=7 yet.\n\nSo at t=49, y=6, action S, so y=6 at t=50.\n\nt=50: y=6, action U, so y_{51} =6 +1=7, so at t=51, y=7.\n\nThen at t=51, y=7, safe, action U, y_{52}=8\n\nt=52: y=8, action U, y_{53}=9\n\nWe reach y=9 at t=53.\n\nBut is this minimal?\n\nH is the number of turns from t_1, so from t=42 to t=53, that's 12 turns? Let's count.\n\nThe sequence of actions from t=42 to t=52? Actions determine the next position.\n\nWe need the actions from t=42 to until we reach y=9.\n\nAt t=53, y=9, which is the goal.\n\nThe actions are taken from turn t_1 to turn t_1 + H -1, and after H actions, we are at y=9.\n\nAfter H actions, position at turn t_1 + H.\n\nSet t_1=42.\n\nAfter actions at t=42,43,..., up to t=42 + H -1, we have H actions.\n\nThen position at t=42 + H.\n\nWe want y_{42+H} =9.\n\nAnd y_{42} =0.\n\nSo sum of H actions Δy must be 9.\n\nEach Δy = -1,0,1, so H >=9.\n\nMinimal H=9 if all U, but we have problem with y=7.\n\nIn our case, with the delay, H=11 actions? Let's see.\n\nIn the above plan:\n\nActions:\n\nt=42: U → y43=1\n\nt=43: U → y44=2\n\nt=44: U → y45=3\n\nt=45: U → y46=4\n\nt=46: U → y47=5\n\nt=47: U → y48=6\n\nt=48: S → y49=6  (since S, Δy=0)\n\nt=49: S → y50=6  (stay again)\n\nt=50: U → y51=7\n\nt=51: U → y52=8\n\nt=52: U → y53=9\n\nSo at t=53, y=9.\n\nNumber of actions: from t=42 to t=52, that's 11 actions (t=42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52), 11 actions.\n\nH=11, position at t=42+11=53.\n\nBut we have two S actions, so net increase: 9 U and 2 S, sum Δy=9, y=9 at t=53.\n\nBut we could reduce the waiting.\n\nIn the above, at t=48, we did S, then at t=49 S, but we only need to avoid being on y=7 at t=49 and t=50.\n\nAt t=48, we are at y=6.\n\nIf at t=48, we do D, down, then y49=5.\n\nThen at t=49, we can do something.\n\nBut going down might not help, since we need to go up later.\n\nAt t=48, y=6, action D, then y49=5.\n\nThen at t=49, y=5, action U, y50=6.\n\nThen t=50, y=6, action U, y51=7, same as before but we went down and up, wasted actions.\n\nWorse.\n\nAt t=48, y=6, action S, y49=6.\n\nThen at t=49, instead of S, we could do U, but if U, y50=7, which is dangerous.\n\nNot good.\n\nSo we must stay or go down at t=49 to avoid y=7 at t=50.\n\nBut we can be at y=7 at t=51.\n\nAnother idea: go up faster to y=8 or something, but we can't, because from y=0, min to y=7 is 7 actions, to t=49.\n\nWe could go to y=6 earlier? But with all U, we are at y=6 at t=48, which is earliest.\n\nt=48 y=6.\n\nThen we need to kill time until we can go to y=7 safely at t=51.\n\nSo we need to be at y=6 or below for turns t=49 and t=50? At t=49, if we are at y=6, not y=7, safe.\n\nSimilarly t=50 at y=6 safe.\n\nThen at t=50, action U, to y=7 at t=51.\n\nSo we need to stay at y=6 for two turns: t=49 and t=50.\n\nBut at t=48, we are at y=6, and we take actions to stay or move.\n\nAt t=48, action S, then t=49 y=6.\n\nThen at t=49, action S, t=50 y=6.\n\nThen t=50 action U, t=51 y=7.\n\nThen U at t=51, t=52 y=8\n\nU at t=52, t=53 y=9\n\nAs before.\n\nCan we reach y=9 faster?\n\nFor example, after reaching y=6 at t=48, instead of staying twice, we could go to another row.\n\nBut we need to go up eventually.\n\nPerhaps we can go to y=7 at t=51 directly, but with fewer delays.\n\nBut from y=6 at t=48, to be at y=7 at t=51, we need to take actions at t=48,49,50.\n\nThe position at t=51 depends on actions at t=48,49,50.\n\ny_{51} = y_{48} + Δy_{48} + Δy_{49} + Δy_{50}\n\ny_{48} =6, so y_{51} = 6 + Δy_{48} + Δy_{49} + Δy_{50}\n\nWe want y_{51} =7, so Δy_{48} + Δy_{49} + Δy_{50} =1\n\nFor example, one U and two S, or one U, one D, one U, but net +1.\n\nMinimal actions: for example, S at t=48, S at t=49, U at t=50: then y_{51} =6 +0 +0 +1=7\n\nOr U at t=48, but if U at t=48, y_{49}=7, which is at t=49, dangerous.\n\nNot good.\n\nD at t=48, y49=5, then need to increase later.\n\nBut y51=6 + (-1) + Δy49 + Δy50, to make 7, so -1 + Δy49 + Δy50 =1, so Δy49 + Δy50=2, so two U, but then y51=6 -1 +1 +1=7, but at t=49 y=5, t=50 y=6, then t=51 y=7.\n\nBut we used D and two U, worse than two S and one U.\n\nSo the efficient way is to stay at y=6 for two turns with S actions.\n\nThus, as before.\n\nBut we have 11 actions to reach y=9 at t=53.\n\nBut H=11.\n\nBut is there a way with H=10?\n\nH=10 actions: from t=42 to t=51, position at t=52.\n\ny_{52} = sum of 10 Δy must be 9.\n\nSo net +9 with 10 actions, so one S or one D and extra U, etc.\n\nBut we need to avoid collision.\n\nIf we go up, we can reach y=8 at t=50 with all U: actions U from t=42 to t=49: 8 actions? Let's see.\n\nt=42: U, y43=1\n\n...\n\nAfter U at t=48: y49=7? t=48 action U, y49=7\n\nBut y=7 at t=49 dangerous.\n\nProblem.\n\nTo reach y=8 at t=50: y50=8.\n\ny50 = sum_{i=42}^{49} Δy_i\n\nWith 8 actions, max y=8 if all U.\n\nBut to have y50=8, all U actions from t=42 to t=49.\n\nThen y43=1, y44=2, ..., y50=8.\n\nAt t=49, y=7? y50=8 at t=50.\n\nPositions: at t=49, y49= position.\n\nAfter actions at t=42 to t=48, y49 = sum_{i=42}^{48} Δy_i\n\nIf all U, 7 actions, y49=7.\n\nThen at t=49, action U, y50=8.\n\nBut at t=49, y=7, which is dangerous, collision.\n\nIf we have a delay earlier, we might reach later.\n\nSuppose we do 9 U and one S in 10 actions.\n\nBut we need to place the S.\n\nIf we place S at some point before, we arrive later.\n\nFor example, suppose we do S at t=42, then y43=0, then U from t=43 to t=50, but actions: t=42 S, y43=0\n\nt=43 U, y44=1\n\n...\n\nt=49 U, y50=7?

Dangerous at t=54,55,56, but with all U we reach y=8 at t=50, which is before, safe.\n\nBut the problem is y=7.\n\nPerhaps we can skip y=7 or something, but we have to go through each row, since we move one step at a time vertically.\n\ny changes by at most 1, so we must visit each integer y between 0 and 9.\n\nSo we must be on y=7 at some point.\n\nWe need to choose when, not during dangerous times.\n\nDangerous times for y=7: t=48,49,50, but t=48 impossible, so t=49 and t=50.\n\nWe must be on y=7 at t<=48 or t>=51.\n\nt<=48 impossible as y<=6, so only t>=51.\n\nThus, we must be on y=7 at t=51 or later.\n\nSimilarly, for other rows, no issue except y=1 and y=8 at later times, but we will be there earlier.\n\ny=1 dangerous at t=54,55,56, but we pass at t=43, safe.\n\ny=8 dangerous at t=54,55,56, with all U we are at y=8 at t=50, safe.\n\nIf we delay, we might be later, but t=54 is late, we should be fine.\n\nIn our path, we reach y=8 at t=52, which is before t=54.\n\nt=52 <54, safe.\n\nNow, back to minimizing H.\n\nWith 11 actions, we reach at t=53.\n\nBut can we do with 10 actions?\n\n10 actions: actions at t=42 to t=51, position at t=52.\n\ny_{52} =9.\n\nSo sum of 10 Δy =9, so 9 U and 1 S, or 10 U and 1 D but y capped, but with 10U, we reach y=10, but y max 9, so if we go up, at some point we might be at y=9 earlier.\n\nFor example, with all U, after 9 actions, at t=51, y=9.\n\nBut to avoid the y=7 at t=49.\n\ny_{51} = sum_{i=42}^{50} Δy_i\n\nIf all U, y51=9, but during, y49=7 at t=49, collision.\n\nWe need to have y49 not 7.\n\ny49 = sum_{i=42}^{48} Δy_i\n\nSet S = sum of first 7 actions (t=42 to t=48) for y49.\n\ny49 = S\n\nWe need S !=7, or if S=7, but t=49 dangerous, so we must have S <=6 or S=7 but we avoid, but S=7 only if all U, which causes collision.\n\nSo we must have S <=6 or S=7 with delay, but S=7 only with all U.\n\nSo for y49, we must have y49 <=6.\n\nSimilarly, y50 must not be 7 if t=50 dangerous, but y50 = y49 + Δy49\n\nt=50 dangerous for y=7, so if y50=7, collision.\n\ny50 = y49 + Δy49\n\nIf y49 <=6, and we do U, y50= y49 +1 <=7, could be 7.\n\nIf y50=7, collision at t=50.\n\nSo we must have y50 !=7.\n\nSimilarly, for y51=9 with 10 actions.\n\ny51 = y50 + Δy50\n\nBut we want y51=9.\n\nSince y50 <=9, and y51= y50 + Δy50, to have y51=9, if y50=9, then Δy50=0 or -1, but y51=9, so if y50=9, Δy50=0, S; or if y50=8, Δy50=1, U; etc.\n\nBut we need y51=9.\n\nNow, constraints: y49 <=6 (to avoid y=7 at t=49 if y49=7, but y49=7 only if S=7, all U)\n\ny49 = S <=6\n\ny50 must not be 7, so y50 !=7\n\ny50 = y49 + Δy49\n\nNow, actions: 10 actions from t=42 to t=51 for y52? Earlier.\n\nActions at t=42 to t=51, 10 actions, y52 = sum of 10 Δy.\n\nSet to 9.\n\ny49 = sum of first 7 actions (t=42 to t=48)\n\ny50 = y49 + Δy49 (action at t=49)\n\ny51 = y50 + Δy50 (t=50)\n\ny52 = y51 + Δy51 (t=51)\n\nWe want y52=9.\n\ny49 <=6\n\ny50 !=7\n\nSince y49 <=6, y50 = y49 + Δy49 <=6 +1=7\n\nIf y50=7, it must not be, so y50 <=6 or y50=8, but y50 <=7 since y49<=6, Δy<=1, y50<=7.\n\ny50 <=7, and y50 !=7, so y50 <=6.\n\nSimilarly, y51 = y50 + Δy50 <=6 +1=7\n\ny52 = y51 + Δy51 <=7+1=8 <9, cannot reach 9.\n\ny52 <=8 if y50<=6.\n\nBut we need y52=9, impossible.\n\nTherefore, with 10 actions, we cannot reach y=9 without being at y=7 at a dangerous time or violating constraints.\n\nIn the derivation: y49 <=6, y50 <=6 (since y50 !=7 and y50<=7), then y51 <=7, y52 <=8 <9, cannot reach y=9 at t=52.\n\nIf we allow y50=7, but t=50 dangerous, collision.\n\nSo indeed, with 10 actions, impossible to reach y=9 without collision.\n\nThus minimal H is 11.\n\nWith 11 actions, we can do as before.\n\nBut in our sequence, we have two S actions.\n\nWe could have different actions.\n\nFor example, go up to y=5, then down or something, but probably not better.\n\nSo let's stick with the sequence.\n\nBut we need to output the actions from t=42.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nt=42: U\n\nt=43: U\n\nt=44: U\n\nt=45: U\n\nt=46: U\n\nt=47: U\n\nt=48: S  (stay at y=6)\n\nt=49: S  (stay at y=6)\n\nt=50: U  (to y=7 at t=51)\n\nt=51: U  (to y=8 at t=52)\n\nt=52: U  (to y=9 at t=53)\n\nBut at t=50, action U, which increases to y=7 at t=51.\n\nAnd t=51 y=7 safe.\n\nNow, we need to confirm for other freeways.\n\nFor example, when we are on y=6 at t=49 and t=50.\n\nt=49: y=6, freeway 6.\n\nAt t=49, ΔT=7, freeway 6 car: left-moving, span [48 -36*7, 83 -36*7] = [48-252, 83-252] = [-204, -169], no 0, safe.\n\nt=50: y=6, ΔT=8, span [48-288,83-288]= [-240,-205], no 0.\n\nt=51: y=7, freeway 7.\n\nAt t=51, ΔT=9, cars:\n\nFirst: (48,37,right,4) span [37+36,48+36]= [73,84]? ΔT=9, [37+4*9,48+4*9]=[37+36,48+36]=[73,84], no 0\n\nSecond: (12,1,right,4) [1+36,12+36]=[37,48], no 0\n\nThird: (-24,-35,right,4) [-35+36, -24+36]=[1,12], no 0, safe.\n\nThen y=8 at t=52, freeway 8.\n\nAt t=52, ΔT=10, freeway 8 car: right-moving, span [-59 +4*10, -48 +4*10] = [-59+40, -48+40] = [-19,-8], no 0, safe.\n\nThen y=9 at t=53, goal.\n\nNow, but we have two S actions, which might be avoidable if we can be on other rows.\n\nFor example, instead of staying at y=6, we could go to y=5 or something, but it might not save time.\n\nPerhaps we can go up to y=7 at t=51 with only one S, but we need to be at y=6 from t=48 to t=50, so we need to stay or move within.\n\nBut we have to spend the turns.\n\nAnother idea: what if we go down to y=4 or something at some point to wait, but it might take more actions to go back.\n\nFor example, at t=47, y=5, instead of U to y=6, we do S or D.\n\nBut if we do S at t=47, y48=5, then we need to go up later, but to reach y=6 later, etc., probably more delays.\n\nSo I think H=11 is minimal.\n\nBut let's confirm the answer format.\n\nWe need the sequence of actions from t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nt_1=42, H=11, so actions from t=42 to t=52.\n\nPosition at t=53=42+11.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 42: U\n\nTurn 43: U\n\nTurn 44: U\n\nTurn 45: U\n\nTurn 46: U\n\nTurn 47: U\n\nTurn 48: S\n\nTurn 49: S\n\nTurn 50: U\n\nTurn 51: U\n\nTurn 52: U\n\nIn the sequence above, at turn 50: U, which is to go up from y=6 at t=50 to y=7 at t=51.\n\nBut in the action, at turn t, we take action, which affects the next position.\n\nIn the sequence, we have:\n\nAfter all, at turn 52: U, to y=9 at t=53.\n\nBut we need to reach (0,9), so at some turn, y=9.\n\nIn this case, at t=53, y=9.\n\nIs there a way to reach earlier?\n\nSuppose we do an extra U somewhere, but we are limited by the y=7 constraint.\n\nPerhaps we can be at y=7 at t=51 with only one wait, but from y=6 at t=48, to y=7 at t=51, we need the actions in between to not cause y=7 at t=49 or t=50.\n\nBut y at t=49 and t=50 must not be 7.\n\ny49 = y48 + Δy48 =6 + Δy48\n\nIf Δy48 = U, y49=7, bad.\n\nIf Δy48 = S or D, y49=6 or 5.\n\nThen y50 = y49 + Δy49\n\nIf y49=6, and Δy49=U, y50=7, bad if t=50.\n\nIf y49=5, Δy49=U, y50=6.\n\nThen y51 = y50 + Δy50, if Δy50=U, y51=7.\n\nBut y49=5 or 6, y50=6, not 7.\n\nBut we used D or S at t=48, so we have an extra non-up action.\n\nThen to reach y=9, we need more actions.\n\nFor example, with y48=6\n\nt=48: D, y49=5\n\nt=49: U, y50=6\n\nt=50: U, y51=7\n\nThen t=51: U, y52=8\n\nt=52: U, y53=9, same as before.\n\nIf we do S at t=48, y49=6\n\nThen to have y50 not 7, we must not do U at t=49, so S or D.\n\nIf S, y50=6, then U at t=50, y51=7, same as before with two S.\n\nIf D at t=49, y50=5, then U at t=50, y51=6, then U at t=51, y52=7, then U t=52 y53=8, U t=53 y54=9, worse.\n\nSo not better.\n\nThus, minimal H is 11.\n\nNow, about freeway 6: we are on it at t=49 and t=50, but as computed, no car at 0, safe.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nIn the beginning, for freeway 3,4,5, dangerous at t=43,44, but we are on them later, safe.\n\ny=3 at t=45, which is after t=44, safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think this is fine.\n\nBut in the sequence, at turn 48 and 49, we have S actions.\n\nPerhaps we can combine with moving down and up, but no benefit.\n\nSo the sequence is as above.\n\nNow, to write the answer.\n\nBut the player position is given as (0,y), and we move vertically.\n\nAlso, for the cars, we have freeway 7 with multiple cars, but we handled.\n\nIn freeway 7, at t=51, we are safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think it's ok.\n</think>\nTo reach the position (0, 9) from (0, 0) at turn \\(t_1 = 42\\) with the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the strategy involves moving up directly to \\(y = 6\\) by turn 48, then waiting at \\(y = 6\\) for two turns (turns 48 and 49) to avoid being on \\(y = 7\\) during the dangerous period (turns 49 and 50), and finally moving up to \\(y = 9\\) by turn 53.\n\nThe dangerous period for \\(y = 7\\) is turns 48 to 50, but being at \\(y = 7\\) at turn 48 is impossible (as \\(y \\leq 6\\) at turn 48). Thus, the player must avoid \\(y = 7\\) at turns 49 and 50. The earliest safe turn to be at \\(y = 7\\) is turn 51, as the car on freeway 7 no longer covers position 0 at that turn.\n\nThe sequence of actions minimizes \\(H\\) to 11 turns, as fewer turns (e.g., \\(H = 10\\)) would either result in a collision or fail to reach \\(y = 9\\) due to the constraints.

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) at turn 48 to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The player moves up, down, or stays, and the cars move left or right with their given speeds.\n\nFirst, I should understand where the cars are at each turn relative to x=0, since that's where I need to be to collide or not. Collision happens only if at turn T, I'm on a freeway y, and for that freeway, there's a car such that 0 is in its span at that turn.\n\nThe player position at turn T is y_T, and I need to be on freeway y at turn T to be affected by cars on that freeway. Also, when I move to a new freeway, I'm not on it until the next turn. So if I move from y to y+1 at turn T, I'm on y at turn T, and on y+1 at turn T+1.\n\nThe goal is to reach y=9 at some turn, say T, so I need to be on freeway 9 at turn T. But freeways are y=1 to 8, and y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, I think? Let me check.\n\nThe vertical axis is y=0,1,2,...,9. Freeways are y=1 to 8, where cars are. y=0 and y=9 are probably safe, no cars. The player starts at (0,0), which is y=0, and needs to reach (0,9), which is y=9. So y=0 and y=9 have no cars, so I don't need to worry about collisions there.\n\nBut when I'm moving between freeways, I need to avoid being on a freeway y=1 to 8 when there's a car at x=0 on that freeway at that turn.\n\nNow, the cars are given at turn t_1=48. For each car, I have head, tail, direction, speed. Let's list them clearly.\n\nFor freeway k, cars are:\n\n- k=1: one car: head -48, tail -59, direction right, speed 4\n\n- k=2: one car: head -48, tail -59, direction right, speed 4\n\n- k=3: two cars: first head 48, tail 37, direction right, speed 4; second head 0, tail -11, direction right, speed 4\n\nHead 0, tail -11? That might be a typo or something. Let me see.\n\nIn the table:\n\n| Freeway k | Cars |\n\n| 1 | (-48, -59, right, 4) |\n\n| 2 | (-48, -59, right, 4) |\n\n| 3 | (48, 37, right, 4), (0, -11, right, 4) |\n\n| 4 | (48, 37, right, 4), (0, -11, right, 4) |\n\n| 5 | (48, 37, right, 4), (0, -11, right, 4) |\n\n| 6 | (48, 83, left, 36) |\n\n| 7 | (48, 37, right, 4), (12, 1, right, 4), (-24, -35, right, 4) |\n\n| 8 | (-48, -59, right, 4) |\n\nFor the cars, when direction is right, head is the front, so for right-moving, head > tail, I assume. Similarly for left-moving, head < tail or something? Let's see the update.\n\nFrom the car update:\n\n- Left-moving: span at t_1 is [h, τ] → at T, [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nSince it's moving left, decreasing x.\n\nIn the span, for left-moving, at t_1, span is [h, τ], which I think h is the head, τ tail. If moving left, head should be on the left, so h > τ, I assume.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving, span [τ, h] at t_1, so τ is tail, h is head, with τ < h.\n\nIn the description:\n\nLeft-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s Δt, τ - s Δt] where Δt = T - t_1\n\nRight-moving: Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt]\n\nSo for right-moving, at t_1, τ is the left end, h is the right end, so τ < h.\n\nFor left-moving, at t_1, h is the left end, τ is the right end, so h > τ, I think, but it says [h, τ], which might imply h < τ if it's an interval, but in notation, it's [h, τ], and for left-moving, it decreases, so if h is head and moving left, h should be larger x, but moving left means decreasing x, so head at larger x.\n\nLet me clarify.\n\nTypically, for a car moving left, the head is at the front, which is higher x value, and it moves to decreasing x, so span [head, tail] with head > tail.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving, head at front, lower x, moving to increasing x, span [tail, head] with tail < head.\n\nIn the notation:\n\nFor left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ], and it becomes [h - s Δt, τ - s Δt], so if h and τ are numbers, and car moves left, h should be the right end (higher x), τ left end (lower x), so for example, if at t_1, h=10, τ=5, then [10,5]? That doesn't make sense as an interval; intervals are usually [min, max].\n\nI think there's inconsistency in notation.\n\nLook: for left-moving, it says Span(t_1) = [h, τ], and then Span(T) = [h - s Δt, τ - s Δt]\n\nBut if [h, τ] is the span, it should be that h is one end, τ the other, but for it to be a proper interval, min and max should be specified.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving, [τ, h] at t_1.\n\nPerhaps it's always written with the left end first? But for left-moving, it's [h, τ], which might have h > τ, so [min, max] is not followed.\n\nTo avoid confusion, I should think in terms of the position at x=0.\n\nCollision if 0 is in the span at turn T.\n\nFor a car, the span at time T is defined based on initial at t_1 and movement.\n\nLet me define Δt = T - t_1 for turn T.\n\nFor each car, I can find when 0 is in its span.\n\nBut for each freeway, there might be multiple cars, so I need to check for each freeway at each turn if there is any car on that freeway such that 0 is in its span at that turn.\n\nThen, when I am on that freeway at that turn, I collide.\n\nNow, for freeway k=1: one car, head h=-48, tail τ=-59, direction right, speed 4.\n\nSince direction right, at t_1, span is [τ, h] = [-59, -48]? No.\n\nFrom the rule: for right-moving, Span(t_1) = [τ, h], so τ is the tail, h is head.\n\nIn this case, for k=1: τ = ? The car is given as (head, tail, dir, speed) = (-48, -59, right, 4)\n\nBut for right-moving, Span(t_1) = [τ, h], so τ should be the left end, h the right end.\n\nHere, head is -48, tail is -59, but -48 > -59, so if head is -48, tail is -59, and direction right, then the car is from x=-59 to x=-48, so left end -59, right end -48.\n\nSo Span(t_1) = [τ, h] = [-59, -48]\n\nThen at time T, Span(T) = [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] = [-59 + 4 Δt, -48 + 4 Δt]\n\nSimilarly for other cars.\n\nIn the input, for each car, it's (head, tail, direction, speed), and for direction, we know how to update.\n\nFor k=1 car: head=-48, tail=-59, dir=right, so at t_1, left end = min(tail,head)? tail=-59, head=-48, so left end -59, right end -48.\n\nSince dir right, Span(t_1) = [τ, h] with τ=-59, h=-48.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, it would be different.\n\nBut in this case, all cars except k=6 are right-moving, I think.\n\nk=6 is left-moving.\n\nFirst, let's list all cars with their spans at t_1 and update.\n\nt_1 = 48.\n\nFreeway 1: one car, right-moving, head=-48, tail=-59, so τ=-59, h=-48, s=4\n\nSpan at T: [ -59 + 4 Δt, -48 + 4 Δt ]\n\nFreeway 2: same as freeway 1, head=-48, tail=-59, right, s=4, so same span: [ -59 + 4 Δt, -48 + 4 Δt ]\n\nFreeway 3: two cars.\n\nFirst car: head=48, tail=37, right, s=4. So for right-moving, Span(t_1) = [τ, h] = [37, 48]\n\nAt T: [37 + 4 Δt, 48 + 4 Δt]\n\nSecond car: head=0, tail=-11, right, s=4. Span(t_1) = [τ, h] = [-11, 0]\n\nAt T: [-11 + 4 Δt, 0 + 4 Δt] = [-11 + 4 Δt, 4 Δt]\n\nFreeway 4: same as freeway 3, two cars: (48,37,right,4) and (0,-11,right,4), so spans at T: [37+4Δt,48+4Δt] and [-11+4Δt,4Δt]\n\nSimilarly freeway 5: same as 3 and 4.\n\nFreeway 6: one car: head=48, tail=83, left, s=36.\n\nDirection left, so for left-moving, Span(t_1) = [h, τ] = [48, 83]? But head=48, tail=83, and moving left, so if head is 48, tail 83, that would mean head at lower x? But moving left, head should be at higher x.\n\nInconsistency.\n\nFor left-moving, Span(t_1) = [h, τ], and h is head, τ tail.\n\nIf car is moving left, head is at the front, which is higher x, tail at lower x.\n\nSo for example, if head=50, tail=40, span [50,40], but that's decreasing, so in interval, it's from min to max, but here [h, τ] with h>τ, so it's not standard interval notation.\n\nBut for collision, we care if 0 in [min, max] of the span.\n\nAt T, Span(T) = [h - s Δt, τ - s Δt]\n\nFor k=6, head=48, tail=83, left, s=36.\n\nSo at t_1, Span(t_1) = [h, τ] = [48, 83]\n\nSince moving left, at T, Span(T) = [48 - 36 Δt, 83 - 36 Δt]\n\nBut 48 - 36 Δt and 83 - 36 Δt, since Δt >=0, 48 -36Δt < 83 -36Δt, so the span is [48-36Δt, 83-36Δt]\n\nFreeway 7: three cars.\n\nFirst: (48,37,right,4) so Span(t_1) = [37,48], at T [37+4Δt,48+4Δt]\n\nSecond: (12,1,right,4) head=12, tail=1? Span(t_1) = [τ,h] = [1,12], at T [1+4Δt,12+4Δt]\n\nThird: (-24,-35,right,4) head=-24, tail=-35, so [τ,h] = [-35,-24], at T [-35+4Δt, -24+4Δt]\n\nFreeway 8: (-48,-59,right,4) same as k=1, [ -59+4Δt, -48+4Δt ]\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need to find for which turns T, 0 is in the span of some car on that freeway.\n\nCollision if at turn T, for freeway y, 0 is in some car's span on y.\n\nSince multiple cars, I need the union of spans for each freeway at each T.\n\nBut I can find for each freeway the times when it is occupied at x=0.\n\nThat is, when 0 is covered by some car on that row.\n\nThen, I need to be on freeway y only when it is not occupied at that turn.\n\ny=0 and y=9 have no cars, so always safe.\n\nI start at y=0 at t=48, and need to reach y=9 at some turn.\n\nPlayer position: at turn T, y_T, and I move at each turn.\n\nActions at turn t determine y_{t+1}.\n\nLet's clarify the timing.\n\nAt turn t, the player chooses action a_t, which determines Δy_t, so y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nThen, at turn t+1, the player is at y_{t+1}.\n\nThe collision is checked at each turn: at turn T, if y_T is between 1 and 8, and if for that freeway, 0 is in some car's span at turn T, then collision.\n\nAlso, when moving, at turn T, I am on y_T, so I am affected by cars on y_T at turn T.\n\nIf I move, at turn T, I am on y_T, and after action, I go to y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nNow, at turn t_1=48, I am at y=0.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nThe minimal number of turns H, meaning from t=48 to t=48+H-1, so after H actions, I am at y=9 at turn t_1 + H -1? Let's see.\n\nStart at turn t_1=48, position y=0.\n\nAfter first action a_{t_1}, at turn t_1+1, y_{t_1+1} = y_{t_1} + Δy_{t_1} = 0 + Δy\n\nAnd so on.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t_1 + H, y_{t_1 + H} is set.\n\nI need y_{t_1 + H} = 9 for some H.\n\nThe turn when I reach y=9 is t_1 + H, and at that turn, I am at y=9, which has no cars, so safe.\n\nThe sequence of actions is from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, total H actions, reaching at turn t_1 + H.\n\nIn the answer format, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" up to \"Turn t_1 + H -1: a_{t_1 + H -1}\", and y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nNow, the minimal H to go from y=0 to y=9 is at least 9, since I need to increase by 9, and each U move +1, S or D less, so minimal if I go up all the time, H=9 actions, to y=9 at turn 57.\n\nBut I may need to wait or go down to avoid collisions, so H might be more.\n\nBut perhaps I can do it in 9 or less? Less than 9? From 0 to 9, minimum 9 moves up, so H=9 is minimum possible, with all U actions.\n\nBut I need to check if that is possible without collision.\n\nIf not, I need to take more turns.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway y=1 to 8, for which turns T (relative to t_1 or absolute) it is occupied at x=0.\n\nSet t_1=48, so for turn T, let Δt = T - 48.\n\nThen for each freeway, find when 0 is in some car's span for that freeway.\n\nStart with freeway 1: one car, span [ -59 + 4 Δt, -48 + 4 Δt ]\n\n0 in span if -59 + 4 Δt <= 0 <= -48 + 4 Δt\n\nSo -59 + 4 Δt <= 0 and 0 <= -48 + 4 Δt\n\nFirst inequality: -59 + 4 Δt <= 0 => 4 Δt <= 59 => Δt <= 59/4 = 14.75, so Δt <= 14 since integer? Turns are discrete, so Δt integer.\n\nT is turn number, integer.\n\nSimilarly, second: 0 <= -48 + 4 Δt => 48 <= 4 Δt => Δt >= 12\n\nSo for freeway 1, occupied at x=0 when Δt >=12 and Δt <=14, so T=48+12=60 to 48+14=62, i.e., turns 60,61,62.\n\nΔt=12,13,14.\n\nT=60,61,62.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same as freeway 1, since same car parameters, so also occupied at T=60,61,62.\n\nNow freeway 3: two cars.\n\nFirst car: span [37 + 4 Δt, 48 + 4 Δt]\n\n0 in this? 37 +4Δt <= 0 <=48 +4Δt\n\nBut 37+4Δt >=37>0 for Δt>=0, so 0 <=48+4Δt always true for Δt>=0, but 37+4Δt <=0? 37+4Δt >=37>0, so never <=0, so 0 not in [37+4Δt,48+4Δt] for any Δt.\n\nSecond car: span [-11 +4Δt, 4Δt]\n\n0 in this if -11 +4Δt <=0 <=4Δt\n\nFirst: -11+4Δt <=0 => 4Δt <=11 => Δt <=11/4=2.75, so Δt <=2\n\nSecond: 0 <=4Δt => Δt >=0\n\nSo for Δt=0,1,2\n\nAt Δt=0, T=48, span [-11,0], 0 is included? -11 +0 = -11, 4*0=0, so [ -11, 0], 0 is the upper end, so yes, 0 in span.\n\nSimilarly Δt=1, span [-11+4,4] = [-7,4], 0 in it.\n\nΔt=2, span [-11+8,8] = [-3,8], 0 in it.\n\nΔt=3, span [-11+12,12] = [1,12], 0 not in [1,12], since 0<1.\n\nSo for second car, occupied at Δt=0,1,2, T=48,49,50.\n\nThus for freeway 3, since first car never occupied at 0, only second car matters, occupied at T=48,49,50.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 4: same as freeway 3, occupied at T=48,49,50.\n\nFreeway 5: same, T=48,49,50.\n\nNow freeway 6: one car, left-moving, head=48, tail=83, s=36.\n\nSpan at T: [48 - 36 Δt, 83 - 36 Δt]\n\n0 in span if 48 -36 Δt <= 0 <= 83 -36 Δt\n\nFirst inequality: 48 -36 Δt <=0 => 48 <=36 Δt => Δt >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈1.333, so Δt >=2\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= 83 -36 Δt => 36 Δt <=83 => Δt <=83/36≈2.305, so Δt <=2\n\nSo Δt >=2 and Δt <=2, so only at Δt=2, T=48+2=50.\n\nAt Δt=2, span [48-72, 83-72] = [-24,11], so 0 in [-24,11], yes.\n\nΔt=1: [48-36,83-36]=[12,47], 0 not in.\n\nΔt=3: [48-108,83-108]=[-60,-25], 0 not in.\n\nSo freeway 6 occupied only at T=50.\n\nNow freeway 7: three cars.\n\nFirst car: same as before, [37+4Δt,48+4Δt], min 37>0, so never 0.\n\nSecond car: (12,1,right,4), head=12, tail=1, so [τ,h]=[1,12] at t_1, at T [1+4Δt,12+4Δt]\n\n0 in [1+4Δt,12+4Δt]? Since 1+4Δt >=1>0 for Δt>=0, so 0 not in, always above 1.\n\nThird car: (-24,-35,right,4), head=-24, tail=-35, so [τ,h]=[-35,-24] at t_1, at T [-35+4Δt, -24+4Δt]\n\n0 in this if -35+4Δt <=0 <= -24+4Δt\n\nFirst: -35+4Δt <=0 => 4Δt <=35 => Δt <=35/4=8.75, so Δt<=8\n\nSecond: 0 <= -24+4Δt => 24 <=4Δt => Δt >=6\n\nSo for Δt=6,7,8\n\nAt Δt=6: [-35+24, -24+24] = [-11,0], 0 in\n\nΔt=7: [-35+28, -24+28] = [-7,4], 0 in\n\nΔt=8: [-35+32, -24+32] = [-3,8], 0 in\n\nΔt=9: [-35+36, -24+36] = [1,12], 0 not in\n\nSo for freeway 7, only third car can have 0 in span, at T=48+6=54, 55, 56? Δt=6,7,8 → T=54,55,56.\n\n48+6=54, 48+7=55, 48+8=56.\n\nNow freeway 8: same as freeway 1 and 2, occupied at T=60,61,62.\n\nSummarize for each freeway, unsafe turns when occupied at x=0:\n\n- y=1: T=60,61,62\n\n- y=2: T=60,61,62\n\n- y=3: T=48,49,50\n\n- y=4: T=48,49,50\n\n- y=5: T=48,49,50\n\n- y=6: T=50\n\n- y=7: T=54,55,56\n\n- y=8: T=60,61,62\n\ny=6 only T=50.\n\nI start at turn 48, y=0.\n\nI need to go to y=9, which is safe.\n\nThe minimal path would be to go up as fast as possible.\n\nBut I need to be at y=1 to 8 only when it is safe.\n\nAt turn 48, I am at y=0.\n\nIf I go up to y=1 at turn 49, but at turn 48, I am at y=0, safe.\n\nAction at turn 48: if I do U, then at turn 49, y=1.\n\nBut at turn 49, y=1 is freeway? y=1 is freeway.\n\nAt turn 49, T=49.\n\nFor y=1, is it occupied? From above, y=1 unsafe at T=60,61,62, not at 49, so should be safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=3,4,5 unsafe at 48,49,50.\n\nLet's list safe turns for each y.\n\nFor each freeway, safe when not occupied at that turn.\n\ny=1: safe except T=60,61,62\n\nSimilarly y=2: same, except T=60,61,62\n\ny=3: safe except T=48,49,50\n\ny=4: safe except T=48,49,50\n\ny=5: safe except T=48,49,50\n\ny=6: safe except T=50\n\ny=7: safe except T=54,55,56\n\ny=8: safe except T=60,61,62\n\nNow, I need to go from y=0 at T=48 to y=9 at some T.\n\ny=0 and y=9 always safe.\n\nThe player can stay, up, down.\n\nI need to minimize H, so probably go up as much as possible, but avoid being on unsafe freeway at unsafe time.\n\nStart at T=48, y=0.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nThe direct up path: actions all U from t=48 to t=56, 9 actions, to y=9 at T=57.\n\nCheck for each turn, when I am on y=1 to 8, if safe.\n\nAt turn 49, y=1: T=49, y=1 safe? y=1 unsafe only at 60,61,62, so at 49 safe.\n\nTurn 50, y=2: similarly, y=2 safe at 50, since unsafe only 60-62.\n\nTurn 51, y=3: T=51, y=3 unsafe at 48,49,50, so at 51 safe.\n\nTurn 52, y=4: T=52, y=4 unsafe at 48,49,50, so 52 safe.\n\nTurn 53, y=5: similarly, safe.\n\nTurn 54, y=6: T=54, y=6 unsafe only at T=50, so at 54 safe.\n\nTurn 55, y=7: T=55, y=7 unsafe at T=54,55,56, oh! at T=55, y=7 is unsafe.\n\ny=7 unsafe at T=54,55,56.\n\nAt turn 55, if I am on y=7, it is unsafe.\n\nIn the path, at turn 54, I would be at y=6 (if all U), then at turn 54, action U, to y=7 at turn 55.\n\nAt turn 55, y=7, and T=55, which is unsafe for y=7.\n\nCollision.\n\nSo I cannot be on y=7 at turn 55.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 56, if I go to y=8, but let's see.\n\nIn all U path:\n\n- Turn 48: y=0, safe\n\n- Action U, to y=1 at turn 49\n\n- Turn 49: y=1, safe\n\n- Action U, to y=2 at turn 50\n\n- Turn 50: y=2, safe (unsafe only 60-62)\n\n- Action U, to y=3 at turn 51\n\n- Turn 51: y=3, T=51, y=3 unsafe at 48,49,50, 51>50, so safe\n\n- Action U, to y=4 at turn 52\n\n- Turn 52: y=4, safe\n\n- Action U, to y=5 at turn 53\n\n- Turn 53: y=5, safe\n\n- Action U, to y=6 at turn 54\n\n- Turn 54: y=6, T=54, y=6 unsafe only at T=50, so safe\n\n- Action U, to y=7 at turn 55\n\n- Turn 55: y=7, T=55, y=7 unsafe at 54,55,56 → collision!\n\nProblem at turn 55.\n\nIf I continue:\n\n- Action U, to y=8 at turn 56\n\n- Turn 56: y=8, T=56, y=8 unsafe at 60,61,62? y=8 unsafe at T=60,61,62, not 56, so should be safe? But at turn 55 collision, so game over.\n\nBut even if, at turn 56, y=8, T=56, y=8 safe since unsafe only 60-62.\n\nThen action U to y=9 at turn 57.\n\nBut at turn 55 collision, so not possible.\n\nSo all U not possible because at turn 55, y=7 is occupied.\n\nI need to avoid being on y=7 at turns 54,55,56.\n\nTurns 54,55,56 are unsafe for y=7.\n\nNow, in the path, I reach y=6 at turn 54 if I go all U, but I can stay or something.\n\nI need to delay or advance the time I am on y=7.\n\nSince y=7 unsafe from T=54 to 56, I need to be on y=7 before 54 or after 56.\n\nBut before 54, I might not be there yet.\n\nI start at T=48, y=0.\n\nIf I go up fast, I reach y=7 at turn 55 in the all U path.\n\nBut at turn 55, unsafe.\n\nSo I need to be on y=7 at different time.\n\nFor example, if I can be on y=7 at T<54 or T>56.\n\nT=53 or earlier, or T=57 or later.\n\nBut T=57: at turn 57, if I am on y=7, but I need to reach y=9.\n\nLet's see the timing.\n\nFirst, from y=0 to y=7, minimum 7 moves up, so at least 7 actions.\n\nIf I start at T=48, after k actions, at turn 48+k, y= something.\n\nAt turn 48, y=0.\n\nAfter 1 action, turn 49, y=1\n\nAfter 2, turn 50, y=2\n\nAfter 3, turn 51, y=3\n\nAfter 4, turn 52, y=4\n\nAfter 5, turn 53, y=5\n\nAfter 6, turn 54, y=6\n\nAfter 7, turn 55, y=7\n\nAfter 8, turn 56, y=8\n\nAfter 9, turn 57, y=9\n\nTo be on y=7, it can be at turns when I have y_t =7 for some t.\n\nIn this sequence, y=7 at t=55.\n\nBut t=55 is unsafe for y=7.\n\nI need y_t=7 for t not in {54,55,56}, but since turns are discrete, t <=53 or t>=57.\n\nt=53: if I am on y=7 at t=53.\n\nIn the sequence above, at t=53, y=5.\n\nTo be at y=7 at t=53, I need to have moved faster or something.\n\nFrom t=48, y=0.\n\nAt t=53, after 5 actions, y can be from 0 to 5, since each action changes y by at most 1.\n\nAfter k actions, y_{48+k} between max(0, min(9, k)) or something, but since start from 0, after k actions, y <= k, and y >=0.\n\nTo be at y=7 at t=53, which is turn 53.\n\nt=53, so from start, Δt = 53-48=5, so after 5 actions, at turn 53, y_{53} =7.\n\nBut after 5 actions, y <=5, since start from 0, each U increases by 1, so maximum y=5 after 5 actions. Cannot be y=7 at t=53.\n\nSimilarly, at t=52, after 4 actions, y<=4.\n\nAt t=51, after 3 actions, y<=3.\n\nAt t=50, after 2 actions, y<=2.\n\nAt t=49, after 1 action, y<=1.\n\nAt t=48, y=0.\n\nSo I cannot be at y=7 before t=55 in the minimal path. Earliest is t=55.\n\nNow, after, at t=57, if I am at y=7.\n\nt=57, after 9 actions, I could be at y=7 if I did not go all up.\n\nBut at t=57, y=7 would be safe, since y=7 unsafe only up to t=56.\n\nt=57 >56, so safe.\n\nBut I need to reach y=9 eventually.\n\nSo I can be on y=7 at t=57 or later.\n\nSimilarly, t=56: at t=56, y=7 is unsafe, as per above.\n\ny=7 unsafe at t=54,55,56.\n\nt=57 is safe.\n\nNow, to have y=7 at t=57, that means at turn 57, position y=7.\n\nThen I need to go up to y=9 from there.\n\nBut let's see the sequence.\n\nI need to avoid being on y=7 during t=54,55,56.\n\nSince I cannot be there earlier, I must be there later.\n\nSo I need to delay reaching y=7 until after t=56.\n\nFor example, be on y=7 at t=57 or later.\n\nNow, at t=57, y=7 is safe.\n\nThen I can go to y=8 and y=9.\n\nBut y=8 has unsafe times at t=60,61,62, which are later, so if I go fast, I might avoid them.\n\nFirst, I need to slow down before reaching y=7.\n\nIn the path, I can stay at some lower y to waste time.\n\nFor example, at some point, I do S or D to not go up too fast.\n\nBut I need to minimize H, so I should not waste too many turns.\n\nH is the number of actions to reach y=9.\n\nIn all U, H=9 to reach at t=57.\n\nIf I delay, H increases.\n\nBut I might be able to reach later but with same H or less? Probably H larger.\n\nSince y=7 is blocked from t=54 to 56, I need to be on y=6 or y=8 during that time.\n\nBut y=6 has unsafe only at t=50, which is early, so at t=54,55,56, y=6 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=8 is safe at t=54,55,56, since unsafe only at 60-62.\n\ny=8 unsafe at 60,61,62, so before that safe.\n\nSo during t=54,55,56, I can be on y=6 or y=8, both safe, but not y=7.\n\nI need to be on y=7 only after t=56.\n\nSo for example, at t=56, I should not be on y=7, but I can be on y=6 or y=8.\n\nThen at t=57, I can go to y=7 if I was on y=6, or to y=9 from y=8, etc.\n\nLet's plan the sequence.\n\nStart at t=48, y=0.\n\nI need to go up.\n\nBut I have to pass through y=3,4,5 which are unsafe at t=48,49,50.\n\nAt t=48, I am at y=0, safe.\n\nIf I go up at t=48, to y=1 at t=49.\n\nt=49, y=1 safe.\n\nIf I go up to y=2 at t=50.\n\nt=50, y=2 safe.\n\nNow at t=50, if I go up to y=3, but at t=51, y=3: t=51, y=3 unsafe at t=48,49,50, but t=51>50, so safe? Earlier I said y=3 unsafe only at t=48,49,50, so t=51 safe.\n\nIn the all U path, at t=51, y=3 is fine.\n\nProblem is later at y=7.\n\nBut at the beginning, y=3,4,5 are unsafe at t=48,49,50, but since I reach y=3 at t=51, which is after, safe.\n\nSimilarly y=4 at t=52, safe; y=5 at t=53, safe.\n\nThen y=6 at t=54, safe.\n\nThen at t=54, I need to go to y=7 at t=55, but unsafe.\n\nSo at t=54, instead of going up, I can stay or go down.\n\nBut I need to reach y=9.\n\nSince y=6 is safe at t=54,55,56, I can stay on y=6 for a few turns.\n\nSimilarly, I can go down to y=5 or something, but y=5 is safe after t=50.\n\nTo avoid being on y=7 during t=54,55,56, I can stay on y=6 until t=56 or later.\n\nFor example, at t=54, y=6, instead of U, I do S, so at t=55, still y=6.\n\nThen at t=55, y=6, safe (since y=6 unsafe only t=50).\n\nThen at t=55, I can do S again, to stay at y=6 at t=56.\n\nt=56, y=6, safe.\n\nThen at t=56, I can go U to y=7 at t=57.\n\nt=57, y=7, which is safe, since t=57>56.\n\nThen from there, I can go to y=8 at t=58, and y=9 at t=59.\n\nNow, what about y=8? y=8 unsafe at t=60,61,62, so at t=58, safe.\n\nSimilarly y=9 safe.\n\nNow, let's see the sequence.\n\nStart t=48, y=0\n\nAction a48: U, to y=1 at t=49\n\nt=49, y=1\n\na49: U, to y=2 at t=50\n\nt=50, y=2\n\na50: U, to y=3 at t=51\n\nt=51, y=3 (safe, since t=51>50)\n\na51: U, to y=4 at t=52\n\nt=52, y=4\n\na52: U, to y=5 at t=53\n\nt=53, y=5\n\na53: U, to y=6 at t=54\n\nt=54, y=6\n\nNow, instead of U, I do S: a54: S, so y stays, at t=55, y=6\n\nt=55, y=6\n\na55: S, to y=6 at t=56? Action at t=55: if S, y_{t+1} = y_t, so at t=56, y=6\n\na55: S, so y_{56} = y_{55} +0 =6\n\nThen at t=56, y=6\n\nNow a56: U, to y=7 at t=57\n\nt=57, y=7 (safe, t=57>56)\n\na57: U, to y=8 at t=58\n\nt=58, y=8 (safe, since t=58<60)\n\na58: U, to y=9 at t=59\n\nt=59, y=9, done.\n\nNow, number of actions: from t=48 to t=58, actions at t=48 to t=58, that's 11 actions? Let's list:\n\nActions at turns: 48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58 → 11 actions, reach y=9 at t=59.\n\nBut earlier with all U, it would be 9 actions to t=57, but with collision.\n\nNow with 11 actions.\n\nBut I can reduce.\n\nIn this sequence, I stayed at y=6 for two extra turns.\n\nBut I only needed to avoid y=7 at t=55 and t=56, but t=54 is also unsafe for y=7, but I was not on it.\n\nIn the sequence above, I stayed at y=6 at t=55 and t=56.\n\nBut at t=56, I could go directly to y=8? No, I have to go through y=7.\n\nUnless I go down or something, but that might take more time.\n\nAnother idea: at t=54, y=6, I could go down to y=5, but that might not help.\n\nPerhaps I can go faster earlier to reach y=7 before t=54, but as we saw, impossible to reach y=7 before t=55.\n\nt=55 is the earliest.\n\nBut t=55 is unsafe.\n\nSo I must delay until t=57.\n\nNow, to minimize H, I should waste as few turns as possible.\n\nIn the above, I wasted two turns at y=6.\n\nBut do I need to waste both?\n\ny=7 unsafe at t=54,55,56.\n\nI need to be not on y=7 at these turns.\n\nIn the path, I am on y=6 at t=54.\n\nIf at t=54, I go up, to y=7 at t=55, unsafe.\n\nIf I stay at t=54, to y=6 at t=55.\n\nThen at t=55, if I go up to y=7 at t=56, but t=56 y=7 unsafe.\n\nIf I stay again at t=55, to y=6 at t=56.\n\nThen at t=56, go up to y=7 at t=57, safe.\n\nSo I need to stay at least two extra turns at y=6 to skip t=55 and t=56 for y=7.\n\nAt t=56, I could go down to y=5 or something, but that might be worse.\n\nSo probably minimum is to stay two turns at y=6.\n\nBut y=6 is safe during that time.\n\nIn the sequence, I have actions from t=48 to t=58, 11 actions.\n\nBut earlier actions: from t=48 to t=53, I go from y=0 to y=6 in 6 actions, to t=54 y=6.\n\nThen stay at y=6 for t=55 and t=56 by doing S at t=54 and t=55.\n\nThen at t=56, U to y=7 at t=57.\n\nThen U to y=8 at t=58, U to y=9 at t=59.\n\nSo actions: U at 48,49,50,51,52,53 (to y=6 at t=54), then S at 54, S at 55 (stay y=6 at t=55 and t=56), then U at 56 (to y=7 at t=57), U at 57 (to y=8 at t=58), U at 58 (to y=9 at t=59).\n\nNow, actions at t=48 to t=58, 11 actions.\n\nBut t=58 action to y=9 at t=59.\n\nNumber of actions: 11, H=11.\n\nBut perhaps I can start later or something.\n\nAnother point: at the beginning, y=3,4,5 unsafe at t=48,49,50.\n\nIn my sequence, I am on y=3 at t=51, which is safe; y=4 at t=52 safe; y=5 at t=53 safe; all after t=50, so fine.\n\nBut I could go slower at the beginning to waste time, but that might make H larger, since I need to reach y=9.\n\nFor example, if I stay at y=0 or something, but that delays.\n\nTo save actions, I should go up as fast as possible until y=6, then stay to waste time during the unsafe period for y=7.\n\nNow, is there a way to waste less than two turns?\n\nFor example, if I can be on y=8 during t=54,55,56.\n\nBut to be on y=8 at t=54, I need to reach earlier.\n\nAt t=54, y=8: from start, t=48 to t=54, 6 actions, max y=6, so impossible to be at y=8 at t=54.\n\nSimilarly, at t=55, after 7 actions, max y=7, but if I am at y=7 at t=55, unsafe.\n\nAt t=56, after 8 actions, max y=8.\n\nIf I can be at y=8 at t=56.\n\nThen from there to y=9.\n\nBut at t=56, y=8: is it safe? y=8 unsafe only at t=60,61,62, so t=56 safe.\n\nNow, to be at y=8 at t=56.\n\nStart t=48 y=0.\n\nAfter 8 actions, at t=56, y=8.\n\nThat means I went up 8 times in 8 actions, so y=8 at t=56.\n\nBut in the sequence, after 8 U actions: at t=49 y=1, t=50 y=2, ..., up to t=56 y=8.\n\nt=56 y=8.\n\nNow, at which turns was I on other y.\n\nt=49 y=1 safe\n\nt=50 y=2 safe\n\nt=51 y=3 safe\n\nt=52 y=4 safe\n\nt=53 y=5 safe\n\nt=54 y=6 safe\n\nt=55 y=7: t=55, y=7 unsafe! Oh, at t=55, I am on y=7, which is unsafe.\n\nSo in going directly to y=8 at t=56, I must be on y=7 at t=55, which is unsafe.\n\nCollision at t=55.\n\nTo avoid that, I need to not be on y=7 at t=55.\n\nBut if I go from y=6 to y=8 directly? No, I can only move one step per turn.\n\nSo I must pass through y=7.\n\nTherefore, I cannot skip y=7; I have to be on it at some point, and t=55 is unavoidable if I go fast, but unsafe.\n\nHence, I must delay so that when I am on y=7, it is not t=54,55,56.\n\nSo only option is to be on y=7 at t=57 or later.\n\nThus, I need to have y=6 for longer.\n\nIn the sequence, I stay at y=6 during t=55 and t=56, then go to y=7 at t=57.\n\nNow, back to y=8: y=8 has unsafe at t=60,61,62, but I can reach before that.\n\nIn my sequence, at t=58, I am on y=8, which is before 60, safe.\n\nThen to y=9.\n\nBut H=11 actions.\n\nCan I reduce H?\n\nFor example, after reaching y=7 at t=57, I go directly to y=9, but I need to go through y=8.\n\nTwo actions: to y=8 at t=58, then to y=9 at t=59.\n\nNo way to skip.\n\nPerhaps I can go down at some point to save time, but unlikely.\n\nAnother idea: at t=54, y=6, I could go down to y=5, then come back, but that might take more actions.\n\nFor example, at t=54, go D to y=5 at t=55.\n\nt=55, y=5, which is safe (since y=5 unsafe only t=48,49,50).\n\nThen at t=55, if I go D again to y=4 at t=56, or stay, or up.\n\nBut then I need to go back up, which takes more actions.\n\nFor instance, from t=55 y=5, if I go U to y=6 at t=56, then U to y=7 at t=57, same as before but I wasted an action going down and up.\n\nWorse.\n\nIf I stay at y=5 for one turn, then go up.\n\nBut still, to reach y=7 at t=57, I need to be at y=6 at t=56 or something.\n\nLet's see.\n\nSuppose at t=54, y=6, I do S, stay at y=6 t=55.\n\nThen at t=55, I do U to y=7 at t=56? But t=56 y=7 unsafe.\n\nNot good.\n\nMust not be on y=7 at t=56.\n\nSo only at t=55, I can do something else.\n\nBut if at t=55, I do D to y=5 at t=56, then at t=56 y=5, then I need to go up to y=6 at t=57, then to y=7 at t=58, later.\n\nThen H larger.\n\nFor example: t=54 y=6, a54: D, to y=5 at t=55\n\nt=55 y=5, a55: U, to y=6 at t=56\n\nt=56 y=6, a56: U, to y=7 at t=57\n\nThen same as before, but I have an extra D and U, so two more actions? From t=54 to t=56, I went to y=5 and back to y=6, whereas in previous I stayed at y=6.\n\nIn previous sequence, at t=54 and t=55, I stayed at y=6 with S actions.\n\nHere, at t=54 D to y=5 at t=55, then t=55 U to y=6 at t=56, so at t=56 y=6, same as before, but I used two actions to go down and up, net no progress, whereas staying I used S actions, also no progress but no y change.\n\nIn terms of actions, both take two actions to stay at same y or return, but going down and up might be riskier if there are other issues, but here y=5 is safe.\n\nBut in both cases, I reach y=6 at t=56, then go to y=7 at t=57, etc.\n\nBut with the down-up, I have more actions: for example, actions: ... a53 U to y=6 at t=54, then a54 D to y=5 at t=55, a55 U to y=6 at t=56, a56 U to y=7 at t=57, etc. So I have extra actions compared to staying.\n\nWith staying: a54 S, a55 S, to y=6 at t=55 and t=56.\n\nWith down-up: a54 D, a55 U, to y=5 at t=55 and y=6 at t=56, but at t=55 I was at y=5, not y=6.\n\nBut for reaching y=7 at t=57, in both cases I need a56 U to y=7.\n\nBut in staying sequence, I have a54 S and a55 S.\n\nIn down-up, I have a54 D and a55 U.\n\nBoth are two actions to cover t=54 and t=55 with y=6 or y=5 then y=6.\n\nBut since I need to be at y=6 to go to y=7, it's similar, but down-up might have been on y=5 which is fine, but no benefit.\n\nMoreover, in down-up, at t=55 I am at y=5, which is safe, but I have to go back.\n\nSo no advantage; staying is simpler.\n\nThus, minimal H should be with two S actions at y=6.\n\nBut H=11.\n\nPerhaps I can waste only one turn.\n\nFor example, if I can be on y=7 at t=57, but reach earlier from below.\n\nBut impossible to reach y=7 before t=55.\n\nt=57 is after.\n\nAnother thought: at t=56, I could go to y=8 directly? No.\n\nOr, since y=8 is safe at t=56, but to be on y=8 at t=56, I must be on y=7 at t=55 or t=56? At t=55, if I am on y=7, go U to y=8 at t=56.\n\nBut at t=55, y=7 unsafe.\n\nIf I am on y=6 at t=55, go U to y=7 at t=56, unsafe.\n\nNo.\n\nSo I must avoid being on y=7 during t=54,55,56.\n\nTherefore, I need to spend those turns on other y.\n\nThe only possibilities are y=6 or y=8, but y=8 cannot be reached early.\n\nSo y=6 is the only option to stay during that period.\n\nThus, I need to be on y=6 at t=54,55,56.\n\nThen at t=56, go to y=7 at t=57.\n\nIn my sequence, I am on y=6 at t=54,55,56 with actions: at t=54 S, t=55 S, so y=6 at t=55 and t=56.\n\nt=56 y=6, then U to y=7 at t=57.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, about the beginning: I have y=3,4,5 unsafe at t=48,49,50.\n\nIn my sequence, I am on them at t=51,52,53, which are safe.\n\nBut could I be on them earlier? For example, if I go up faster, but I start at t=48 y=0, at t=49 y=1, t=50 y=2, so cannot be on y=3 before t=51.\n\nIf I start by staying at y=0, but that delays.\n\nFor example, at t=48, if I do S, stay at y=0 at t=49, then I can go up later.\n\nBut then I reach y=6 later, and I still need to waste time at y=6, so H larger.\n\nFor instance, suppose I stay at y=0 for one turn: t=48, a48: S, to y=0 at t=49\n\nThen a49: U, to y=1 at t=50\n\nt=50 y=1? t=50 y=1, but I need to go up.\n\nThen a50: U, to y=2 at t=51\n\na51: U, to y=3 at t=52\n\nAnd so on, I reach y=6 at t=55, then I need to stay until t=56 or something, then to y=7 at t=57, etc., more actions.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo better to go up fast to y=6, then stay.\n\nNow, in my sequence, I have 11 actions.\n\nBut let's confirm the turn numbers.\n\nt_1 = 48\n\nStart: turn 48, position y=0\n\nAfter action a48, at turn 49, y= y48 + Δy\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSequence:\n\n- Turn 48: action U, to y=1 at turn 49\n\n- Turn 49: action U, to y=2 at turn 50\n\n- Turn 50: action U, to y=3 at turn 51\n\n- Turn 51: action U, to y=4 at turn 52\n\n- Turn 52: action U, to y=5 at turn 53\n\n- Turn 53: action U, to y=6 at turn 54\n\n- Turn 54: action S, to y=6 at turn 55  (since S, no change)\n\n- Turn 55: action S, to y=6 at turn 56\n\n- Turn 56: action U, to y=7 at turn 57\n\n- Turn 57: action U, to y=8 at turn 58\n\n- Turn 58: action U, to y=9 at turn 59\n\nNow, at turn 59, y=9, reached.\n\nNumber of actions: from turn 48 to 58 inclusive, that's 11 actions: 48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58.\n\nH=11.\n\nBut in the sequence, the last action is at turn 58, reaching y=9 at turn 59.\n\nThe minimal H is 11.\n\nBut is there a way with H=10?\n\nSuppose H=10 actions, then reach y=9 at turn 58.\n\nAfter 10 actions, at turn 58, y=9.\n\nTo have y=9 at turn 58, I must have been at y=8 at turn 57 or something.\n\nWith 10 actions, I need net +9 in y, so I must have 9 U and possibly some S or D, but S and D don't change y, so if I have any S or D, y increase less, so to reach y=9, I must have exactly 9 U and possibly one S or D, but with 10 actions, if I have 9 U and one S, then y increases by 9, to y=9 at some turn.\n\nBut the turn when I reach depends on when I do the S.\n\nSimilarly, if I do D, y decreases, so I need extra U to compensate.\n\nBut to minimize H, I should not do D, only U and S.\n\nAssume only U and S actions.\n\nWith 10 actions, to reach y=9, I need exactly 9 U and one S, since start from y=0.\n\nThe S action wastes one turn.\n\nNow, I reach y=9 at turn 58.\n\nThe sequence must include one S somewhere.\n\nNow, I need to avoid the unsafe times.\n\nSpecifically, for y=7, avoid t=54,55,56.\n\nIn the path, I must be on y=7 at some turn.\n\nIf I go all U except one S, I can reach y=9 at turn 58.\n\nFor example, if I do S at some point.\n\nThe earliest I can reach y=9 is turn 57 with all U, but not possible.\n\nWith one S, I reach later.\n\nFor instance, if I do S at turn k, then I reach y=9 one turn later than all U.\n\nAll U reaches at t=57, with S, at t=58.\n\nNow, the position at each turn.\n\nSuppose I do the S at y=6, for example.\n\nAt t=54, y=6, instead of U, I do S, so at t=55 y=6.\n\nThen at t=55, I do U to y=7 at t=56.\n\nBut at t=56, y=7, which is unsafe! t=56 is in 54-56.\n\nCollision.\n\nIf I do S earlier, say at t=53.\n\nAt t=53, if I do S, stay at y=5 at t=54? Let's see.\n\nStart: t=48 U to y=1 t=49\n\nt=49 U to y=2 t=50\n\nt=50 U to y=3 t=51\n\nt=51 U to y=4 t=52\n\nt=52 U to y=5 t=53\n\nNow at t=53, y=5, if I do S, then to y=5 at t=54\n\nThen at t=54, U to y=6 at t=55\n\nt=55 U to y=7 at t=56 → but t=56 y=7 unsafe.\n\nSame issue.\n\nIf I do S at t=54: t=54 y=6, S to y=6 at t=55\n\nThen t=55 U to y=7 at t=56 → unsafe.\n\nAlways when I go to y=7 at t=56, unsafe.\n\nIf I do S later, but I need to reach y=9 at t=58.\n\nFor example, after y=6, if I do S at t=54, to y=6 t=55\n\nThen at t=55, instead of U, I do S again, but then I stay, and at t=56 y=6, then U to y=7 at t=57.\n\nBut then at t=57 y=7, then U to y=8 at t=58, but I need y=9 at t=58, but I am at y=8 at t=58, not 9.\n\nTo reach y=9 at t=58, I need to be at y=8 at t=57.\n\nThen from y=8 at t=57, U to y=9 at t=58.\n\nBut to be at y=8 at t=57, I must be at y=7 at t=56 or earlier.\n\nt=57 y=8, so at t=56, I must be on y=7 and go U, but t=56 y=7 unsafe.\n\nIf at t=56 I am on y=6 and go U to y=7 at t=57, then to y=8 at t=58.\n\nBut then y=9 at t=59.\n\nWith 10 actions including one S, I might reach y=9 at t=58 only if I don't have the extra stay.\n\nBut with one S, if I do it when I would be at a safe position.\n\nFor example, suppose I do S at t=50.\n\nt=48 U to y=1 t=49\n\nt=49 U to y=2 t=50\n\nAt t=50, y=2, do S, to y=2 at t=51\n\nThen t=51 U to y=3 t=52\n\nt=52 U to y=4 t=53\n\nt=53 U to y=5 t=54\n\nt=54 U to y=6 t=55\n\nt=55 U to y=7 t=56 → unsafe\n\nSame.\n\nIf I do S at a point where I can delay y=7.\n\nBut to have y=7 at t=57, I need to be on y=6 at t=56.\n\nWith 10 actions to reach y=9 at t=58, if I do S at t=56, for example.\n\nBut at t=56, if I do S, I stay at whatever y, but I need to be at y=8 at t=57 to go to y=9 at t=58.\n\nBut if at t=56 I am at y=8, then S to y=8 at t=57, then U to y=9 at t=58.\n\nBut to be at y=8 at t=56, I must have gone through y=7 at t=55, unsafe.\n\nIf at t=56 I am at y=7, S to y=7 at t=57, but y=7 at t=57 safe, then U to y=8 at t=58, but I need y=9 at t=58, not possible.\n\nWith 10 actions, to reach y=9 at t=58, the only way is to be at y=8 at t=57, then U to y=9 at t=58.\n\nTo be at y=8 at t=57, I must be at y=7 at t=56 and go U, but t=56 y=7 unsafe.\n\nOr at y=7 at t=55 go U to y=8 at t=56, but t=55 y=7 unsafe.\n\nNo way to be at y=8 at t=57 without being on y=7 at an unsafe time.\n\nTherefore, with H=10, it is impossible to avoid collision.\n\nSimilarly, with H=9, impossible as before.\n\nThus, minimal H is 11.\n\nIn my sequence, I have 11 actions, reaching at t=59.\n\nNow, I need to output the actions.\n\nIn the sequence, I also have to ensure that for other freeways, no issue.\n\nFor example, when I am on y=3 at t=51, it is safe, etc.\n\nIn my sequence:\n\nAt turn 51: y=3, T=51, which is after 50, safe.\n\nSimilarly all others.\n\nAt turn 55: I am on y=6, which is freeway 6, at T=55.\n\nIs y=6 occupied? From earlier, y=6 unsafe only at T=50, so at T=55, safe.\n\nSimilarly, no other constraints.\n\ny=8 at t=58, T=58, y=8 unsafe at 60-62, so safe.\n\nNow, about freeway 7: I am on y=7 at t=57, T=57, which is after 56, so safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nNow, the sequence of actions:\n\nStart from turn 48.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 48: U\n\nTurn 49: U\n\nTurn 50: U\n\nTurn 51: U\n\nTurn 52: U\n\nTurn 53: U\n\nTurn 54: S\n\nTurn 55: S\n\nTurn 56: U\n\nTurn 57: U\n\nTurn 58: U\n\nAt turn 58, action U, to y=9 at turn 59.\n\nIn the answer, it should be from turn t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nt_1=48, H=11, so actions from turn 48 to 48+10=58.\n\nt_1 + H -1 = 48 + 11 -1 = 58.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, in the box.\n\nBut let me write the actions.\n\nAlso, in the car state, for freeway 6, there was a car, but I didn't go there at unsafe time.\n\nIn the sequence, I was on y=6 at t=54,55,56, all safe.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nI think that's minimal.\n\nPerhaps I can do with H=11 but different, but same number.\n\nSo I think this is the solution.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 48\\) is 11. This sequence avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by staying at \\(y = 6\\) during turns 55 and 56 (using \"S\" actions) to avoid being on \\(y = 7\\) during its unsafe turns (54, 55, and 56). The actions are chosen to move up (\"U\") as quickly as possible except for the necessary stays (\"S\") to delay reaching \\(y = 7\\) until turn 57, when it is safe.\n\nThe sequence of actions \\(\\{a_t\\}\\) for turns \\(t = 48\\) to \\(t = 58\\) is as follows:\n\n- At turn 48, action \"U\" moves to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 49.\n- At turn 49, action \"U\" moves to \\(y = 2\\) at turn 50.\n- At turn 50, action \"U\" moves to \\(y = 3\\) at turn 51.\n- At turn 51, action \"U\" moves to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 52.\n- At turn 52, action \"U\" moves to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 53.\n- At turn 53, action \"U\" moves to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 54.\n- At turn 54, action \"S\" stays at \\(y = 6\\) at turn 55.\n- At turn 55, action \"S\" stays at \\(y = 6\\) at turn 56.\n- At turn 56, action \"U\" moves to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 57.\n- At turn 57, action \"U\" moves to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 58.\n- At turn 58, action \"U\" moves to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 59.\n\nThis sequence ensures that the player is never on a freeway \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) when it is occupied at \\(x = 0\\), as per the car states and their movement rules. Specifically:\n- \\(y = 3, 4, 5\\) are occupied at turns 48, 49, 50; the player is on them at turns 51, 52, 53 (safe).\n- \\(y = 6\\) is occupied only at turn 50; the player is on it at turns 54, 55, 56 (safe).\n- \\(y = 7\\) is occupied at turns 54, 55, 56; the player is on it at turn 57 (safe).\n- \\(y = 1, 2, 8\\) are occupied at turns 60, 61, 62; the player is on them earlier (safe).\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 48: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 49: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 50: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 51: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 52: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 53: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 54: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 55: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 56: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 57: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 58: U \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible without colliding with any cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t_1 = 54, and I start at y=0. I can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing my y-position by +1, -1, or 0 each turn, but I must stay within y=0 to y=9.\n\nCollision happens only if at some turn T, I'm on a freeway y=k (for k=1 to 8) and there's a car on that freeway where 0 is in its span at that turn. The note says that if I move to a different y at turn T, I'm not considered on that new y until the next turn, so at turn T, I'm still on the previous y for collision purposes.\n\nLet me denote the current turn as t=0 for simplicity, since t_1=54 is the starting point. So at turn t=0, I'm at y=0.\n\nI need to reach y=9 by some turn H, with actions from t=0 to t=H-1.\n\nFirst, since I start at y=0 and need to get to y=9, and I can only change by +1, 0, or -1 each turn, the minimum number of turns is 9 if I go up every turn. But I have to avoid cars on y=1 to 8, so it might take more turns if I have to wait or go down sometimes.\n\nNow, the cars are on freeways y=1 to y=8. Each freeway has cars with positions given at t=0 (t_1=54).\n\nThe car positions are given as (head, tail, direction, speed). For left-moving, head is left, tail is right? Let's see the update rule.\n\nFor left-moving: span at t_1 is [h, τ], and at T > t_1, it becomes [h - s*(T-t_1), τ - s*(T-t_1)]. Since it's moving left, decreasing x, so head is at smaller x, I think.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving: span at t_1 is [τ, h], which might be [left, right] or something. Let's clarify the notation.\n\nFrom the update:\n\nLeft-moving: initial span [h, τ], with h and τ, and after moving left, both decrease by s per turn.\n\nSimilarly, right-moving: initial span [τ, h], and both increase by s per turn.\n\nIn the table, for example, freeway 1: (-48, -59, right, 4)\n\nDirection is right, so it should be [τ, h] for initial span? But here it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nPerhaps head and tail are defined based on direction.\n\nTo avoid confusion, let's interpret the span from the values.\n\nFor a car, the span is the interval it occupies, and for collision, we care if x=0 is in that interval at turn T.\n\nAlso, since the grid is infinite, cars are moving, so their positions change over time.\n\nLet t be the turn number relative to t_1, so at t=0, we have initial positions.\n\nFor each car, at time t (turns after t_1), the span can be calculated.\n\nThen for each freeway, at each turn, we need to check if there is any car on that freeway with 0 in its span.\n\nBut since multiple cars per freeway, we need to check all.\n\nNow, collision occurs only if at turn T, I am on freeway y=k, and for that k, at turn T, 0 is in the span of some car on k.\n\nIf I move to a different y at turn T, I am not on that new y until turn T+1, so at turn T, I am on y from turn T-1 or start.\n\nAt turn T, after action, I am at y_{T}, and that is where I am for collision at turn T.\n\nThe player update: after action a_t at turn t, y_{t+1} is set.\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\n\"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd y_T is the position at turn T.\n\nAlso, from the note: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T\"\n\nTurn T: you take action a_T, which determines y_{T+1}.\n\nAt turn T, you are at position y_T, which was set from previous action.\n\nThen you take action a_T, which sets y_{T+1}.\n\nFor collision at turn T, it's based on y_T and the car spans at turn T.\n\nIf you move to y_{T+1} at turn T, but since y_{T+1} is set after action, at the time of turn T, you are at y_T, so for collision check at turn T, it's y_T that matters.\n\nThe note says: if you move to different y at turn T, meaning if a_T causes y_{T+1} ≠ y_T, then you are not on y_{T+1} at turn T, so you don't collide with cars on y_{T+1} at turn T, even if 0 is in span at T for that freeway, because you are not there yet.\n\nBut for the freeway you are on at turn T, which is y_T, if 0 is in span at T for some car, you collide.\n\nAlso, when you arrive at y_{T+1} at turn T+1, you might collide if 0 in span at T+1.\n\nIn this case, since we start at y=0, and y=0 is not a freeway, so no cars there, so at turn 0, we are safe.\n\nWe need to go to y=9, which might be safe or not, but y=9 is not listed, so probably no cars, or is it a freeway? Freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 should be safe, no cars.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are not freeways, so no cars, so we can be there safely.\n\nThe freeways are y=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8, so y=0 and y=9 are clear.\n\nNow, for the cars, let's list all cars per freeway at t=0.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: head=-48, tail=-59, direction=right, speed=4\n\nSince direction right, initial span is [τ, h]? From the update rule.\n\nFor right-moving, initial span [τ, h] with τ and h, and at T, [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nIn the input, it's given as (head, tail, ...)\n\nFor freeway 1: head=-48, tail=-59, dir=right.\n\nIf dir=right, and span is [τ, h], so τ should be left end, h right end.\n\nBut here head=-48, tail=-59, and -48 > -59, so if tail=-59, head=-48, and dir=right, so left end is tail=-59, right end head=-48, so span at t1 is [-59, -48]? But [τ, h] with τ=-59, h=-48, so min to max is [-59, -48].\n\nThen at time t, span is [τ + s t, h + s t] = [-59 + 4t, -48 + 4t]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFreeway 2: same as freeway 1: (-48, -59, right, 4), so span at t: [-59 + 4t, -48 + 4t]\n\nFreeway 3: two cars: (48, 37, right, 4) and (0, -11, right, 4)\n\nFirst car: head=48, tail=37, dir=right. Since dir right, span [τ, h] = [37, 48]? Tail=37, head=48, so if tail is left, head right, then [37,48].\n\nAt t: [37 + 4t, 48 + 4t]\n\nSecond car: head=0, tail=-11, dir=right, so span [τ, h] = [-11, 0] at t1, at t: [-11 + 4t, 0 + 4t] = [-11+4t, 4t]\n\nFreeway 4: same as freeway 3: (48,37,right,4) and (0,-11,right,4), so same spans: [37+4t,48+4t] and [-11+4t,4t]\n\nFreeway 5: same as 3 and 4.\n\nFreeway 6: one car: (48,83,left,36)\n\nDirection left, so for left-moving, initial span [h, τ], with h and τ.\n\nHere head=48, tail=83, dir=left.\n\nSince left-moving, head should be left end? From update: for left-moving, initial [h, τ], at T [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nSo h is left end, τ is right end.\n\nHere head=48, tail=83, and 48 < 83, so if head is left, tail right, then span [48,83] at t1.\n\nAt t: [48 - 36t, 83 - 36t]\n\nFreeway 7: three cars: (48,37,right,4), (12,1,right,4), (-24,-35,right,4)\n\nAll right-moving.\n\nFirst car: head=48, tail=37, dir=right, span [τ,h] = [37,48] at t1, at t: [37+4t,48+4t]\n\nSecond car: head=12, tail=1, dir=right, span [τ,h] = [1,12] at t1, at t: [1+4t,12+4t]\n\nThird car: head=-24, tail=-35, dir=right, span [τ,h] = [-35,-24] at t1, at t: [-35+4t,-24+4t]\n\nFreeway 8: (-48,-59,right,4), same as freeway 1, span [-59+4t,-48+4t]\n\nNow, for each freeway, at each turn t, we need to know if there is a car with 0 in its span.\n\nThat is, for a given k and t, if there is a car on k with min <= 0 <= max of its span at t.\n\nThen, when I am at y=k at turn t, I collide if 0 is in some span for freeway k at turn t.\n\nI start at t=0, y=0. y=0 is not a freeway, so safe.\n\nI need to reach y=9, which is also not a freeway, so safe when I arrive.\n\nNow, since I can only change y by at most 1 per turn, the path must go through each y from 0 to 9, but I can stay or move down, so I might not visit all, but to go from 0 to 9, I must increase y, so I will visit y=0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 in sequence if I go up, but I can stay or go down, so I might spend multiple turns at some y or go back.\n\nBut since I want min H, probably I want to go up as fast as possible, only deviating to avoid collisions.\n\nH is the number of turns, from t=0 to t=H-1, actions a_0 to a_{H-1}, position at t=H is y_H.\n\ny_t at turn t after action.\n\nSet t=0: y_0 = 0 (given)\n\nAfter action a_0, y_1 = y_0 + Δy_0\n\n...\n\nAfter action a_{H-1}, y_H = y_{H-1} + Δy_{H-1}\n\nWe want y_H = 9.\n\nSo the position after H actions is at turn H.\n\nAt each turn t, for t=0 to H-1, when we are at y_t, we need no collision, which depends on y_t and t.\n\nAt turn t, we are at y_t, and we take action a_t, which sets y_{t+1}.\n\nCollision at turn t if y_t is between 1 and 8, and for that freeway, 0 in some car span at turn t.\n\nFor turn t=0, y_0=0, not freeway, safe.\n\nFor turn t, if y_t = k, 1<=k<=8, then check if freeway k has 0 in span at time t.\n\nTime t is turns from t_1, so absolute turn is t_1 + t.\n\nBut since the car positions depend on t, we use t relative.\n\nNow, to reach y=9, min H is 9, if I go up every turn.\n\nBut I need to check for each freeway k, at the time I am on it, whether it is safe.\n\nSince I move one step at a time, I will be on each y from 1 to 8 for at least one turn, unless I skip, but I can't skip, since max change 1, so I must visit each y from 0 to 9, but y=0 and 9 safe, so I need to be on each y=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 for at least one turn, and I need to choose when to be there so that at that turn, no car has 0 in span.\n\nFor min H, I should try to go up as fast as possible, so I will be on each y=k at turn k, if I start from 0 and go up each turn.\n\ny_t at turn t.\n\nIf I always go up, a_t = U for all t, then y_t = t for t from 0 to 9.\n\ny_0=0, after a_0=U, y_1=1, after a_1=U, y_2=2, ..., after a_8=U, y_9=9.\n\nSo at turn t, y_t = t.\n\nI need to be at y=t at turn t, for t from 0 to 8, but at turn t, y_t=t.\n\nFor collision at turn t, if y_t = k with 1<=k<=8, and k=t in this case.\n\nSo for each k from 1 to 8, at turn t=k, I am on freeway k, and I need that at turn t=k, for freeway k, no car has 0 in span.\n\nThen I can reach in 9 turns.\n\nIf not safe, I need to delay or something.\n\nFirst, let's check for each k and at turn t=k, whether freeway k is safe.\n\nt relative to t_1=54, but since car positions depend on t, we can compute.\n\nSet t=0 at start.\n\nFor freeway 1: at turn t, spans: [-59+4t, -48+4t]\n\n0 in span if -59+4t <= 0 <= -48+4t, so 4t <= 48 and 4t >= 59? Let's solve.\n\n-59 +4t <= 0 and 0 <= -48 +4t\n\nSo 4t <= 48 and 4t >= 59? No:\n\n-59 +4t <= 0 => 4t <= 59\n\n0 <= -48 +4t => 4t >= 48\n\nSo 48 <= 4t <= 59, so 12 <= t <= 14.75, so t=12,13,14.\n\nAt t=12: -59+48 = -11, -48+48=0, so [-11,0], 0 is included.\n\nAt t=13: -59+52= -7, -48+52=4, [-7,4], 0 in.\n\nt=14: -59+56= -3, -48+56=8, [-3,8], 0 in.\n\nt=15: -59+60=1, -48+60=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, before t=12, 4t<48, so -48+4t<0, so 0 not in [negative, negative].\n\nAfter t=14, 4t>59? t=15, min=1>0, so 0 not in.\n\nSo for freeway 1, 0 in span only when t=12,13,14.\n\nNow, at turn t, if I am on freeway 1, collision if t=12,13,14.\n\nBut for min path, I would be on y=1 at t=1.\n\nt=1 is not 12,13,14, so safe? t=1: 4t=4, min=-55, max=-44, both negative, 0 not in, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, for other t.\n\nNow for freeway 1, unsafe only at t=12,13,14.\n\nBut at t=1, safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same as freeway 1, since same car, so unsafe at t=12,13,14.\n\nNow freeway 3: two cars.\n\nFirst car: [37+4t, 48+4t], 0 in if 37+4t <=0 <=48+4t? But 37+4t >=37>0 for t>=0, so min>0, 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: [-11+4t, 4t], 0 in if -11+4t <=0 <=4t, so 4t <=11 and 4t >=0? -11+4t <=0 => 4t <=11 => t<=2.75\n\n0 <=4t always for t>=0.\n\nSo -11+4t <=0 <=4t when 4t <=11, so t<=2.75, so t=0,1,2.\n\nAt t=0: [-11,0], 0 in.\n\nt=1: [-7,4], 0 in.\n\nt=2: [-3,8], 0 in.\n\nt=3: [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo second car has 0 in span at t=0,1,2.\n\nFirst car never.\n\nSo for freeway 3, unsafe at t=0,1,2.\n\nAt turn t, unsafe if t=0,1,2.\n\nNow for min path, I would be on y=3 at t=3? y_t = t, so at t=3, y=3.\n\nAt t=3, freeway 3: t=3, which is after 2, so safe? t=3, 4t=12, second car [1,12], min=1>0, 0 not in, first car [37+12=49,48+12=60], min>0, so safe at t=3.\n\nBut unsafe at t=0,1,2, but at t=3, safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 4: same as freeway 3, since same cars, so unsafe at t=0,1,2, safe at t>=3.\n\nFreeway 5: same, unsafe t=0,1,2.\n\nNow freeway 6: one car, left-moving, span at t: [48 - 36t, 83 - 36t]\n\n0 in span if 48 -36t <= 0 <= 83 -36t\n\nSo 48 -36t <=0 and 0 <=83-36t\n\nFirst: 48-36t <=0 => 36t >=48 => t >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈1.333, so t>=2 since t integer\n\nSecond: 0 <=83-36t => 36t <=83 => t <= 83/36 ≈2.305, so t<=2\n\nt>=2 and t<=2, so only t=2.\n\nAt t=2: 48-72= -24, 83-72=11, so [-24,11], 0 in.\n\nAt t=1: 48-36=12, 83-36=47, [12,47], min>0, 0 not in.\n\nt=3: 48-108= -60, 83-108= -25, both negative, 0 not in.\n\nSo freeway 6 unsafe only at t=2.\n\nNow freeway 7: three cars.\n\nFirst car: [37+4t, 48+4t], min=37+4t >=37>0, so 0 never in.\n\nSecond car: [1+4t, 12+4t], min=1+4t >=1>0, so 0 never in.\n\nThird car: [-35+4t, -24+4t], 0 in if -35+4t <=0 <= -24+4t\n\nSo -35+4t <=0 => 4t <=35 => t<=8.75\n\n0 <= -24+4t => 4t >=24 => t>=6\n\nSo t>=6 and t<=8.75, so t=6,7,8.\n\nAt t=6: min=-35+24= -11, max=-24+24=0, [-11,0], 0 in.\n\nt=7: min=-35+28= -7, max=-24+28=4, [-7,4], 0 in.\n\nt=8: min=-35+32= -3, max=-24+32=8, [-3,8], 0 in.\n\nt=9: min=-35+36=1, max=-24+36=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo third car has 0 in span at t=6,7,8.\n\nFirst and second never, so freeway 7 unsafe at t=6,7,8.\n\nFreeway 8: same as freeway 1 and 2, span [-59+4t, -48+4t], unsafe at t=12,13,14.\n\nNow, back to the min path: if I go straight up, y_t = t.\n\nAt turn t, on freeway y=t.\n\nCheck for each t from 1 to 8:\n\nt=1: y=1, freeway 1, at t=1, is it safe? Freeway 1 unsafe only at t=12,13,14, t=1 not, so safe.\n\nt=2: y=2, freeway 2, same as freeway 1, unsafe only at t=12,13,14, so t=2 safe.\n\nt=3: y=3, freeway 3, unsafe at t=0,1,2, but t=3>2, safe.\n\nt=4: y=4, freeway 4, same as 3, unsafe at t=0,1,2, t=4 safe.\n\nt=5: y=5, freeway 5, same, unsafe t=0,1,2, t=5 safe.\n\nt=6: y=6, freeway 6, unsafe only at t=2, t=6≠2, so safe.\n\nt=7: y=7, freeway 7, unsafe at t=6,7,8.\n\nAt t=7, y=7, freeway 7, unsafe! Because t=7 is in 6,7,8.\n\nt=6,7,8 unsafe for freeway 7.\n\nAt t=7, if I am on y=7, I collide.\n\nSimilarly, t=8: y=8, freeway 8, unsafe at t=12,13,14, t=8 not, so safe? Freeway 8 is like 1 and 2, unsafe only at t=12,13,14, so at t=8, safe.\n\nBut at t=7, problem.\n\nIn the straight path: at t=7, y=7, freeway 7 is unsafe at t=7.\n\nSo collision.\n\nTherefore, I cannot be on freeway 7 at turn t=7.\n\nSimilarly, at t=6 and t=8, freeway 7 is also unsafe, but I might not be on it then.\n\nIn straight path, at t=6, y=6, which is freeway 6, not 7.\n\nFreeway 6: at t=6, is it safe? Freeway 6 unsafe only at t=2, so at t=6, safe.\n\nAt t=7, y=7, freeway 7 unsafe.\n\nAt t=8, y=8, freeway 8 safe.\n\nBut at t=7, collision.\n\nSo I need to avoid being on y=7 at t=7.\n\nSince I want min H, I should try to go up but delay or advance when I am on y=7.\n\nI could be on y=7 at a different turn.\n\nFor example, if I stay at some point, I can be later.\n\nOr go down, but that might take more turns.\n\nSince min H, I should minimize extra turns.\n\nFirst, let's list for each freeway, when it is unsafe.\n\nFreeway 1: unsafe t=12,13,14\n\nFreeway 2: same, t=12,13,14\n\nFreeway 3: unsafe t=0,1,2\n\nFreeway 4: same, t=0,1,2\n\nFreeway 5: same, t=0,1,2\n\nFreeway 6: unsafe t=2 only\n\nFreeway 7: unsafe t=6,7,8\n\nFreeway 8: unsafe t=12,13,14\n\nNow, for y=7, freeway 7 is unsafe at t=6,7,8.\n\nSo I need to be on y=7 when t not in {6,7,8}.\n\nSince I start from y=0 at t=0, and go to y=9, I must pass through y=7 at some turn.\n\nLet s be the turn when I am on y=7.\n\nThat is, y_s =7.\n\ns can be from 7 to ... but since I want min time, s around 7.\n\nBut at s, if s in {6,7,8}, collision, so s must not be 6,7,8.\n\ns is the turn when I am at y=7, so s >=7.\n\nAt turn s, y_s=7.\n\ns cannot be 6,7,8? s=6: but if s=6, y_6=7, but y_t=t in straight, but s=6, y=7? No.\n\ny_s=7, so s must be at least 7.\n\nSimilarly, s can be 7,8,9,... but if s=7, and t=s=7, which is in unsafe set.\n\nSimilarly s=8, t=8, unsafe.\n\ns=6: if y_6=7, but to be at y=7 at turn 6, I must have come from below, but y_5=6, y_6=7, so at turn 6, I arrive at y=7.\n\nAt turn t, y_t is position, so for collision at turn t, it depends on y_t.\n\nSo if y_s=7, then at turn s, I am on y=7, and it must be safe, so s not in {6,7,8} for freeway 7.\n\nBut s=6: if y_6=7, that means at turn 6, I am on y=7.\n\nSimilarly, s=7: y_7=7, on y=7 at turn 7.\n\ns=8: y_8=7, on y=7 at turn 8.\n\nBut for freeway 7, unsafe at t=6,7,8, so if I am on y=7 at any of these turns, collision.\n\nTherefore, I cannot be on y=7 at turn 6,7, or 8.\n\nSo s must be <=5 or >=9.\n\ns<=5: but y_s=7, since I start from y=0 at t=0, to be at y=7 at s<=5, I need to have moved faster, but I can only increase by 1 per turn, so y_s <= s, so if s<=5, y_s <=5 <7, cannot be 7. So impossible to be at y=7 at s<=5.\n\nSimilarly, s>=9 is possible.\n\nSo I must be at y=7 at some s>=9.\n\nSimilarly, for other freeways, but only y=7 has a problem in the min path.\n\nIn the straight path, only y=7 at t=7 is unsafe.\n\nOther freeways are fine at their min times.\n\nFor example, y=1 at t=1: freeway 1 safe at t=1.\n\ny=2 at t=2: freeway 2 safe.\n\ny=3 at t=3: freeway 3 safe at t=3.\n\nSimilarly y=4,5,6,8 all safe at t=k.\n\ny=6 at t=6: freeway 6 safe, since unsafe only t=2.\n\ny=8 at t=8: freeway 8 safe, unsafe only t=12-14.\n\nOnly y=7 at t=7 unsafe.\n\nSo I need to be at y=7 at some s>=9.\n\nNow, since I want min H, I should go up to y=6 as fast as possible, then stay or something until s=9 to go to y=7.\n\nBut I need to reach y=9.\n\nLet me list the positions.\n\nI can go up to y=6 quickly.\n\nAt t=0, y=0, safe.\n\nAfter a_0=U, y_1=1 at t=1.\n\nAt t=1, y=1, freeway 1 safe.\n\nAfter a_1=U, y_2=2 at t=2, freeway 2 safe.\n\nAfter a_2=U, y_3=3 at t=3, freeway 3 safe (since unsafe only t=0,1,2 but t=3>2).\n\nAfter a_3=U, y_4=4 at t=4, freeway 4 safe.\n\nAfter a_4=U, y_5=5 at t=5, freeway 5 safe.\n\nAfter a_5=U, y_6=6 at t=6, freeway 6 safe (unsafe only t=2).\n\nNow at t=6, y=6.\n\nI need to go to y=7, but I cannot go at t=7 because if I go up at t=6, a_6=U, then y_7=7 at t=7, but at t=7, y=7, freeway 7 unsafe.\n\nIf I stay at t=6, a_6=S, then y_7=6 at t=7? At turn t=7, y_7=6.\n\nThen I am on y=6 at t=7.\n\nFreeway 6: at t=7, is it safe? Freeway 6 unsafe only at t=2, so at t=7, safe.\n\nThen I can go up later.\n\nBut I need to go to y=7.\n\nAt turn t=7, if y_7=6, then I take action.\n\nTo be at y=7 at some s>=9.\n\nFor example, at t=6, y_6=6.\n\nIf I stay at t=6: a_6=S, then y_7=6.\n\nAt t=7, y_7=6, safe.\n\nThen at t=7, I can go up: a_7=U, then y_8=7 at t=8.\n\nBut at t=8, y=7, freeway 7 unsafe at t=8? Freeway 7 unsafe at t=6,7,8, so t=8 is unsafe.\n\nIf y_8=7 at t=8, collision.\n\nIf at t=7, I stay again: a_7=S, y_8=6.\n\nThen at t=8, y_8=6, safe (freeway 6).\n\nThen at t=8, I go up: a_8=U, y_9=7 at t=9.\n\nNow t=9, y=7, freeway 7: unsafe at t=6,7,8, t=9>8, so safe? At t=9, freeway 7: third car, min=-35+36=1, max=12, [1,12], 0 not in, other cars min>0, so safe.\n\nYes.\n\nThen from there, I can go to y=8 and y=9.\n\nAfter y_9=7 at t=9, I need to go to y=9.\n\nSo at t=9, y_9=7, take a_9=U, y_10=8 at t=10.\n\nAt t=10, y=8, freeway 8: unsafe only at t=12,13,14, t=10<12, so safe? Freeway 8 span [-59+4t, -48+4t], at t=10, min=-59+40=-19, max=-48+40=-8, both negative, 0 not in, safe.\n\nThen a_10=U, y_11=9 at t=11.\n\ny=9, not freeway, safe.\n\nNow, total turns: from t=0 to t=11, y_11=9, so H=11 actions? Let's see the actions.\n\nt from 0 to 10, actions a_0 to a_10, 11 actions, y at t=11 is 9.\n\nNumber of turns: we have actions from t=0 to t=10, that's 11 actions, position after last action is y_11=9.\n\nIn terms of H, y_{t_1 + H} =9 after H actions? Let's clarify.\n\nIn the problem: sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, so t from 0 to H-1, actions, and after that, at turn t_1 + H, position is (0,9).\n\nIn relative t, actions a_t for t=0 to H-1, then y_H =9.\n\nHere, with actions, we have:\n\nt=0: a_0=U, y1=1\n\nt=1: a1=U, y2=2\n\n...\n\nUp to t=5: a5=U, y6=6\n\nThen at t=6: we need to stay or something.\n\nIn the above plan:\n\nAt t=6: a6=S, y7=6 (since y7 = y6 + Δy6, if S, Δy=0, so y7=6)\n\nThen t=7: a7=S, y8=6 (action at t=7, y_{t+1}, so y8 = y7 + Δy7, if S, y8=6)\n\nThen t=8: a8=U, y9=7\n\ny9 at turn t=9? Position y_t at turn t.\n\nAt turn t=6, y6=6\n\nAction a6=S, so y7 = y6 + 0 =6, so at turn t=7, position y7=6\n\nAction a7=S, so y8 = y7 +0 =6, at turn t=8, position y8=6\n\nAction a8=U, so y9 = y8 +1 =7, at turn t=9, position y9=7\n\nThen action a9=U, y10 = y9 +1 =8, at turn t=10, position y10=8\n\nAction a10=U, y11 = y10 +1 =9, at turn t=11, position y11=9\n\nWe want y_H=9, so H=11.\n\nActions from t=0 to t=10, that's 11 actions.\n\nBut min H=9 is not possible due to the delay.\n\nCan I avoid staying twice?\n\nI need to be on y=7 at t>=9.\n\nAt t=9, y=7.\n\nFrom start, I can reach y=6 at t=6, as before.\n\nThen I need to go to y=7 at t=9.\n\nFrom y=6 at t=6 to y=7 at t=9, I have three turns: t=6,7,8.\n\nAt t=6, y=6.\n\nI need to be at y=7 at t=9, so I must increase y by 1 between t=6 and t=9.\n\nBut I can take actions at t=6,7,8.\n\nIf I go up at t=8, I get to y=7 at t=9.\n\nBefore that, I can stay or go down, but going down might not help.\n\nIf I go up earlier, I get to y=7 earlier, but I cannot because of unsafe times.\n\nFor example, if at t=6, I go up, a6=U, then y7=7 at t=7, but t=7 unsafe.\n\nIf at t=7, I go up, a7=U, then y8=7 at t=8, unsafe.\n\nSo I must not go up at t=6 or t=7 to avoid being on y=7 at t=7 or t=8.\n\nSimilarly, I cannot be on y=7 at t=6, but to be on y=7 at t=6, I must have come from y=6 at t=5 or something, but at t=5, y=5, if I go up, y6=6 at t=6, not 7.\n\nTo be at y=7 at t=6, I need y6=7, which requires that at t=5, y5=7 and stay, or y5=6 and up, but y5=6 and up: at t=5, y5=6, a5=U, y6=7 at t=6.\n\nBut at t=6, y=7, which is unsafe because freeway 7 unsafe at t=6.\n\nSimilarly, if I arrive earlier.\n\nSo indeed, the earliest I can be on y=7 safely is t=9.\n\nSo I must have y9=7.\n\nNow, from y=0 at t=0 to y=9, I need to spend some turns.\n\nTo have y9=7, that means I have only increased to 7 in 9 turns, so I must have stayed or gone down in some turns.\n\nSince min H, I should minimize the delay.\n\nI need to reach y=9, so after y=7, I go up to 8 and 9.\n\nIn the above, with y9=7, then y10=8, y11=9.\n\nTotal H=11.\n\nCan I reach higher earlier?\n\nFor example, if I go up faster to y=6, but I am at y=6 at t=6, which is fine.\n\nThen from t=6 to t=9, I need to be at y=7 only at t=9.\n\nSo between t=6 and t=8, I must be at y=6 or less, but since I am at y=6 at t=6, and I want to go to y=7 at t=9, I need to stay at y=6 for some turns.\n\nSpecifically, from t=6 to t=8, I am at y=6 or less, but if I go down, I have to come back, which takes more turns, so better to stay.\n\nSo at t=6,7,8, I should stay at y=6, then at t=8, go up to y=7 at t=9.\n\nActions: at t=6: S, y7=6\n\nt=7: S, y8=6\n\nt=8: U, y9=7\n\nThen t=9: U, y10=8\n\nt=10: U, y11=9\n\nBut y11=9 at t=11.\n\nAfter a10 at t=10, y11=9.\n\nNow, what about the other freeways? In this path, I am on each y=k at t=k for k=1 to 6, all safe as before.\n\nThen at t=7 and t=8, I am on y=6, which is freeway 6.\n\nAt t=7: y=6, freeway 6, t=7, unsafe only at t=2, so safe.\n\nAt t=8: y=6, freeway 6, t=8, safe.\n\nThen at t=9: y=7, freeway 7, t=9, safe as computed.\n\nAt t=10: y=8, freeway 8, t=10, safe.\n\nThen t=11: y=9, safe.\n\nIn the actions, I have a6=S, a7=S, a8=U, so I stayed twice at y=6.\n\nBut is there a way with only one stay?\n\nFor example, if I can be at y=7 at t=9, but reach earlier to other points.\n\nSuppose at some point I go down to avoid or something, but that might not help.\n\nAnother idea: since freeway 7 is unsafe only at t=6,7,8, but I could be on y=7 at t=5? But impossible, y_t <= t, so at t=5, y<=5<7.\n\nt=9 is the earliest possible.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=8 earlier or something, but I have to go through y=7.\n\nUnless I skip, but I can't, since only change by 1.\n\nSo I think 11 is minimal.\n\nBut let me confirm if at t=9, y=7 is indeed safe.\n\nFreeway 7 at t=9:\n\nCars:\n\nFirst: [37+4*9, 48+4*9] = [37+36,48+36]=[73,84], min>0\n\nSecond: [1+36,12+36]=[37,48], min>0\n\nThird: [-35+36, -24+36]=[1,12], min=1>0, so 0 not in any span, safe.\n\nSimilarly, at t=10, y=8, freeway 8: span [-59+4*10, -48+4*10]=[-59+40, -48+40]=[-19,-8], both negative, 0 not in.\n\ny=9 safe.\n\nNow, about the starting point: at t=0, y=0, safe.\n\nActions:\n\nt=0: U, to y=1\n\nt=1: U, to y=2\n\nt=2: U, to y=3\n\nt=3: U, to y=4\n\nt=4: U, to y=5\n\nt=5: U, to y=6\n\nt=6: S, stay y=6\n\nt=7: S, stay y=6\n\nt=8: U, to y=7\n\nt=9: U, to y=8\n\nt=10: U, to y=9\n\nAfter t=10 action, y=9 at turn t=11.\n\nNumber of actions: 11 actions, from t=0 to t=10.\n\nH such that after H actions, y_H=9, so H=11.\n\nIn the sequence, actions for turns t_1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nWith H=11.\n\nBut is there a shorter way?\n\nSuppose I go up to y=5 or something and wait, but that might take more turns.\n\nFor example, if I go to y=5 at t=5, then stay until t=8, but at t=8 I can go to y=6, but then I need to go to y=7 later.\n\nAt t=5: y=5, if I stay at t=5, a5=S, y6=5 at t=6? Let's not.\n\nFrom above, I need to be at y=7 at t>=9.\n\nThe fastest is to reach y=6 at t=6, then wait at y=6 until t=8, go up at t=8 to y=7 at t=9.\n\nI have to wait two turns, so minimum H=11.\n\nPerhaps I can reach y=6 earlier? But I start at y=0, to y=6, min 6 turns, at t=6.\n\nCannot earlier.\n\nGo down and up, but that increases turns.\n\nSo yes.\n\nNow, but I need to check if during the waiting at y=6, is it always safe.\n\ny=6, freeway 6.\n\nFreeway 6 unsafe only at t=2.\n\nAt t=6,7,8, all not t=2, so safe.\n\nAs computed.\n\nSimilarly, no other issues.\n\nBut in the car list, freeway 6 has one car, which is left-moving, but at t=6,7,8, the span is far away.\n\nAt t=6: [48-36*6, 83-36*6] = [48-216, 83-216] = [-168,-133], both negative.\n\nt=7: [48-252,83-252]=[-204,-169], negative.\n\nt=8: [48-288,83-288]=[-240,-205], negative, so 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to output the actions starting from turn t_1=54.\n\nSo actions for turn 54, 55, ..., up to turn 54 + 10 = 64.\n\nRelative t=0 is turn 54.\n\nAction at turn 54: a_{t_1} = a_0 = U\n\nIn the sequence, for turn t_1 + t, t from 0.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 54: a_{54} = U\n\nTurn 55: a_{55} = U (to y=2)\n\n...\n\nUp to turn 59: a_{59} = U (to y=6?

After that, moving up to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 9 relative (absolute turn 63) is safe, followed by moving to \\(y = 8\\) and \\(y = 9\\).\n\nThe sequence of actions for turns 54 to 64 (11 actions) achieves this:\n- Turns 54 to 59: Move up (U) each turn to reach \\(y = 6\\) by turn 60.\n- Turns 60 and 61: Stay (S) at \\(y = 6\\) to avoid being on \\(y = 7\\) during unsafe turns 60–62.\n- Turns 62 to 64: Move up (U) each turn to reach \\(y = 9\\) by turn 65.\n\nThis sequence ensures no collisions:\n- At turns 55–59 (\\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 5\\)): All freeways are safe at the respective turns.\n- At turns 60 and 61 (\\(y = 6\\)): Freeway 6 is safe, as it is unsafe only at relative turn \\(t = 2\\) (absolute turn 56).\n- At turn 63 (\\(y = 7\\)): Freeway 7 is safe at relative turn \\(t = 9\\) (absolute turn 63).\n- At turn 64 (\\(y = 8\\)): Freeway 8 is safe, as it is unsafe only at turns \\(t = 12, 13, 14\\) relative (absolute turns 66–68).\n- \\(y = 0\\) and \\(y = 9\\) are not freeways, so no collisions occur there.\n\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H = 11\\).\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 54: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 55: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 56: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 57: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 58: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 59: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 60: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 61: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 62: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 63: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 64: U }",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to 8. The current turn is t₁=60, and I start at y=0. Each turn, I can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing my y-position by +1, -1, or 0, but I have to stay within 0 to 9.\n\nCollision happens only if at the turn T when I'm on a freeway y, and for that freeway, there's a car where 0 is in its span at that exact turn. Importantly, when I move to a new row, I'm not on that row until the next turn. So if I move from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T I'm still on y, and I arrive at y+1 at turn T+1. So I don't get hit by cars on y+1 at turn T.\n\nThe car positions are given for turn t₁=60, and they move at constant speed. For right-moving cars, the span shifts right by s per turn, so the head and tail both increase by s. For left-moving, both decrease by s.\n\nLet me list all the cars for each freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: one car, (-48, -59, right, 4). Since it's right-moving, at turn T, span is [τ + s(T-t₁), h + s(T-t₁)] but in the update rule, for right-moving, it says Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t₁), h + s(T-t₁)]. Head and tail: the notation is (head, tail, direction, speed). But for right-moving, head should be the front, which is larger, tail smaller? Let's see: for freeway 1, head=-48, tail=-59. Since it's right-moving, and head > tail? -48 > -59, yes, so head is right, tail left. So at time T, position = tail + s(T-t₁) to head + s(T-t₁).\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, head and tail both decrease.\n\nAlso, collision if 0 is in the span at turn T for the freeway I'm on.\n\nI start at y=0 at t=60. y=0 is not a freeway, I think, since freeways are y=1 to 8. So at y=0, no cars, so I'm safe there. Similarly, y=9 might be safe, but I need to reach (0,9), which I assume is the goal.\n\nThe problem says \"reach (0,9)\", and y=9, so probably y=9 is not a freeway, so no cars there. Freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 should be safe.\n\nBut when I'm at y=9, I'm not on any freeway, so no collision possible. Similarly for y=0.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=0 to y=9, moving through y=1 to 8, but avoiding when cars are at x=0.\n\nEach move changes y by one, so to go from 0 to 9, I need at least 9 moves, but I might have to wait or detour to avoid cars.\n\nSince I can only move one row at a time, and I have to be on each row at some point, but I can stay or move down, so I might not go directly up; I might go down to avoid something, but that might increase H, so probably minimal H is achieved by going up directly if possible, but I need to check when it's safe to be on each row.\n\nSince the grid is only vertical, and cars are on horizontal freeways, I think each freeway is a row, and cars move left or right on that row.\n\nSo for each row y from 1 to 8, I need to be on that row at some turn T, and at that turn, for that row, no car should have 0 in its span.\n\nAlso, when I move, I change row at the end of the turn, so when I decide to move at turn T, I am on y_T during turn T, and I move to y_{T+1} at the start of turn T+1.\n\nLet me denote the turn when I am on row y as T_y.\n\nFor y=0, T=60, I start at (0,0) at t=60.\n\nThen for each subsequent turn, I choose an action.\n\nI need to reach y=9 at some turn.\n\nSince I start at t=60, y=0, and I need to get to y=9.\n\nThe minimal H is the number of turns from start, so if I go directly up without waiting, H=9, arriving at y=9 at t=68.\n\nBut I might need to wait on some rows.\n\nFirst, I should compute for each freeway, when is x=0 occupied by a car.\n\nFor a given freeway k, and for a car on it, the position at time T (relative to t₁=60) is:\n\nLet Δt = T - 60\n\nThen for a right-moving car with head h, tail τ, speed s:\n\nThe span at T is [τ + s * Δt, h + s * Δt]\n\nSimilarly for left-moving: [h - s * Δt, τ - s * Δt]? No.\n\nFrom the update: left-moving: Span(T) = [h - s (T-t₁), τ - s (T-t₁)]\n\nBut head and tail: for left-moving, if head is the front, which is left, so for left-moving, head should be larger x if x increases right, but in the notation, for freeway 6, it has (48,83,left,36), head=48, tail=83? 48<83, so for left-moving, if head=48, tail=83, but 48<83, so tail is larger? That might be inconsistent.\n\nLet's look at the car on freeway 6: (48,83,left,36). Head=48, tail=83, but 48<83, so if left-moving, the head should be on the left, so smaller x, tail on right, larger x. So for left-moving, head is min, tail is max? But in the span, it says for left-moving: [h - sΔt, τ - sΔt], so if h=48, τ=83, then at T, [48 - sΔt, 83 - sΔt], which since s>0, as T increases, both decrease, so the car moves left.\n\nAt x=0, it is occupied if 0 is between 48 - sΔt and 83 - sΔt, inclusive? But 48 - sΔt <= 83 - sΔt always since 48<83.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving, like freeway 1: head=-48, tail=-59, both negative, so at T, [ -59 +4Δt, -48 +4Δt ], so min to max.\n\nGeneral: for any car, the span at T is [min_pos + s_dir * s * Δt, max_pos + s_dir * s * Δt] where s_dir = +1 for right, -1 for left, but min and max depend on head and tail.\n\nTo avoid confusion, let's define the left and right ends.\n\nFor a car, let L be the leftmost point, R be the rightmost point at t₁.\n\nThen for right-moving, at T, L_T = L + s * (T - t₁), R_T = R + s * (T - t₁)\n\nFor left-moving, L_T = L - s * (T - t₁), R_T = R - s * (T - t₁)\n\nIn the notation, (head, tail, dir, speed), but head and tail might not be min and max.\n\nFor example, freeway 1: head=-48, tail=-59, dir=right, so head is right end? -48 > -59, so R = head = -48, L = tail = -59? But tail is usually the end, so let's see the values.\n\nAt t₁=60, for freeway 1, span is [ -59, -48 ] since tail to head, but -59 to -48, so L = -59, R = -48.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 3, cars: (48,37,right,4) — head=48, tail=37, so if right-moving, head should be right, so R=48, L=37? 37<48, so L=37, R=48.\n\nAnd another car (0,-11,right,4), head=0, tail=-11, so L=-11, R=0.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6: (48,83,left,36), head=48, tail=83, left-moving, so if left-moving, head is left end? But 48<83, so L=48, R=83? Then for left-moving, L_T = L - sΔt, R_T = R - sΔt.\n\nIn the update rule, it says for left-moving: [h - sΔt, τ - sΔt], with h=48, τ=83, so [48 - sΔt, 83 - sΔt], so L_T = 48 - sΔt, R_T = 83 - sΔt.\n\nSince 48<83, L_T < R_T, so the car occupies [L_T, R_T] with L_T <= R_T.\n\nSimilarly for all.\n\nSo for any car, at time T, the span is an interval [A_T, B_T] with A_T <= B_T.\n\nA car occupies x=0 at time T if A_T <= 0 <= B_T.\n\nFor each freeway, I need to find when x=0 is occupied by any car on that freeway.\n\nSince there might be multiple cars, but for collision, if any car has 0 in span, it's occupied.\n\nSo for each row k, I need the times T when it is occupied at x=0.\n\nThen, when I am on row k at time T, it must not be occupied at that T.\n\nNow, since the cars move continuously, but time is discrete, I can compute for each row the set of T where it is safe, i.e., not occupied.\n\nT is integer, since turns are discrete.\n\nΔt = T - t₁ = T - 60.\n\nLet me define Δt relative to t₁=60.\n\nSo for each freeway, find for which integer Δt, x=0 is not occupied.\n\nStart with freeway 1: one car, L= -59, R= -48, s=4, right-moving.\n\nA_T = -59 + 4 Δt\n\nB_T = -48 + 4 Δt\n\nOccupied if A_T <= 0 <= B_T, i.e., -59 + 4 Δt <= 0 <= -48 + 4 Δt\n\nWhich is 4 Δt <= 59 and 0 <= -48 + 4 Δt? Let's solve inequalities.\n\n-59 + 4 Δt <= 0 => 4 Δt <= 59 => Δt <= 59/4 = 14.75, so Δt <= 14 since integer\n\n0 <= -48 + 4 Δt => 48 <= 4 Δt => Δt >= 12\n\nSo occupied when 12 <= Δt <= 14\n\nThus for Δt <=11 or Δt >=15, it is safe.\n\nΔt from 0 to? Well, we care about future, but past might not matter, but for completeness.\n\nNow freeway 2: same as freeway 1, (-48,-59,right,4)? Head=-48, tail=-59, so L= -59, R= -48, s=4, right, same as above, occupied when 12<= Δt <=14.\n\nNow freeway 3: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (48,37,right,4) — head=48, tail=37, right-moving, so L=37, R=48, s=4\n\nA_T = 37 + 4 Δt\n\nB_T = 48 + 4 Δt\n\nOccupied if 37 +4 Δt <= 0 <= 48 +4 Δt? But 37+4Δt <=0? Since Δt>=0, 37+4Δt >0, so 0 <= B_T always true for Δt>=0, but A_T =37+4Δt >0 for Δt>=0, so 0 < A_T <= B_T, so 0 is never <= A_T since A_T >0, so 0 not in [A_T,B_T] for any Δt. So this car never occupies x=0.\n\nSecond car: (0,-11,right,4), head=0, tail=-11, so L= -11, R=0, s=4, right-moving.\n\nA_T = -11 + 4 Δt\n\nB_T = 0 + 4 Δt = 4 Δt\n\nOccupied if A_T <=0 <= B_T, i.e., -11 +4 Δt <=0 and 0 <= 4 Δt\n\n0 <= 4 Δt always for Δt >=0? Δt integer, 4 Δt >=0 for Δt>=0.\n\n-11 +4 Δt <=0 => 4 Δt <=11 => Δt <= 2.75, so Δt <=2\n\n0 <= 4 Δt always for Δt>=0.\n\nSo occupied when Δt <=2\n\nFor Δt >=3, not occupied.\n\nThus for freeway 3, it is occupied only if the second car occupies, so when Δt <=2, occupied; for Δt >=3, safe, since first car never at 0.\n\nNow freeway 4: same as freeway 3, cars (48,37,right,4) and (0,-11,right,4), same as above, so occupied when Δt <=2, safe when Δt >=3.\n\nFreeway 5: same as above, (48,37,right,4) and (0,-11,right,4), so same as freeway 3 and 4.\n\nNow freeway 6: one car (48,83,left,36), head=48, tail=83, left-moving, so L=48, R=83? For left-moving, A_T = h - s Δt =48 -36 Δt\n\nB_T = τ - s Δt =83 -36 Δt\n\nSince left-moving.\n\nOccupied if A_T <=0 <= B_T, i.e., 48 -36 Δt <=0 and 0 <=83 -36 Δt\n\nFirst: 48 -36 Δt <=0 => 48 <=36 Δt => Δt >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈1.333, so Δt >=2\n\nSecond: 0 <=83 -36 Δt => 36 Δt <=83 => Δt <= 83/36 ≈2.305, so Δt <=2\n\nThus occupied when Δt >=2 and Δt <=2, so only at Δt=2.\n\nBecause for Δt=2, A_T=48-72= -24, B_T=83-72=11, so -24<=0<=11, yes.\n\nFor Δt=1, A_T=48-36=12, B_T=83-36=47, both positive, 0 not <= A_T=12? A_T=12>0, so 0 not in [12,47]\n\nFor Δt=3, A_T=48-108= -60, B_T=83-108= -25, both negative, 0 not <= B_T=-25? B_T=-25<0, so 0 not in [-60,-25]\n\nSo only at Δt=2, occupied.\n\nThus for freeway 6, safe except at Δt=2.\n\nNow freeway 7: three cars.\n\nFirst: (48,37,right,4) — same as before, never at 0.\n\nSecond: (12,1,right,4) — head=12, tail=1, right-moving, so L=1, R=12, s=4\n\nA_T =1 +4 Δt\n\nB_T=12 +4 Δt\n\nOccupied if 1+4Δt <=0 <=12+4Δt? But 1+4Δt >=1>0, so 0 < A_T, so 0 not in [A_T,B_T] for any Δt. Never at 0.\n\nThird car: (-24,-35,right,4) — head=-24, tail=-35, so L=-35, R=-24, s=4, right-moving.\n\nA_T = -35 +4 Δt\n\nB_T = -24 +4 Δt\n\nOccupied if -35 +4 Δt <=0 <= -24 +4 Δt\n\nWhich is: -35 +4 Δt <=0 => 4 Δt <=35 => Δt <= 35/4=8.75, so Δt <=8\n\nAnd 0 <= -24 +4 Δt => 24 <=4 Δt => Δt >=6\n\nSo occupied when 6 <= Δt <=8\n\nFor other Δt, not occupied.\n\nNow, the first and second cars never at 0, so for freeway 7, occupied only when third car is at 0, i.e., 6<= Δt <=8.\n\nThus safe except when 6<= Δt <=8.\n\nFinally, freeway 8: (-48,-59,right,4), same as freeway 1, occupied when 12<= Δt <=14.\n\nNow, summarize for each row k, the times Δt when it is occupied (unsafe):\n\nk=1: unsafe at Δt=12,13,14\n\nk=2: same, unsafe at 12,13,14\n\nk=3: unsafe at Δt=0,1,2 (since occupied when Δt<=2)\n\nΔt=0,1,2 unsafe; safe for Δt>=3\n\nBut Δt relative to t₁, so at Δt=0, T=60, etc.\n\nk=4: same as k=3, unsafe Δt=0,1,2; safe Δt>=3\n\nk=5: same, unsafe Δt=0,1,2; safe Δt>=3\n\nk=6: unsafe only at Δt=2; safe otherwise.\n\nk=7: unsafe at Δt=6,7,8\n\nk=8: unsafe at Δt=12,13,14\n\nNow, I need to go from y=0 at Δt=0 (T=60) to y=9.\n\nI start at y=0, Δt=0.\n\nAt each turn, I choose U, D, or S, changing y.\n\nI need to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nThe path must not be on a row when it is occupied at that time.\n\nSince I move one row per turn if I go up, but I can stay or go down.\n\nTo minimize turns, I should go up as much as possible, but may need to wait on safe rows.\n\nI start at y=0, which is safe, at Δt=0.\n\nI need to go to y=1, but at Δt=0, y=1 (freeway 1) is safe? Freeway 1 is k=1.\n\nFor k=1, unsafe only at Δt=12,13,14. At Δt=0, it is safe, since Δt=0 <=11.\n\nSimilarly, for y=1, k=1, at Δt=0: safe.\n\nBut I need to be on row k at some time T, and at that T, it must be safe for k.\n\nWhen I move to a row, I arrive at the next turn.\n\nLet me denote the sequence.\n\nAt turn T, I am at position y_T, and I choose action a_T, which determines y_{T+1}.\n\nAt turn T, I am on row y_T during that turn, so I need that at time T, row y_T is not occupied if y_T between 1 and 8.\n\nFor y=0 and y=9, always safe.\n\nI start at T=60, y=0, safe.\n\nI need to reach y=9 at some T.\n\nThe minimal H: if I go directly up, I would be at y=1 at T=61, y=2 at T=62, ..., y=9 at T=68? Let's see:\n\nAt T=60: y=0\n\nAfter action a_60, at T=61, y_{61} = y_60 + Δy, depending on a_60.\n\nIf I do U at T=60, then y_{61} = 0 +1 =1\n\nThen at T=61, I am on y=1.\n\nSimilarly, if I do S at T=60, y_{61}=0, still at y=0.\n\nTo go up, I need to choose U at some points.\n\nThe time to reach y=9: since I start at y=0, I need at least 9 up moves to get to y=9, and possibly some S or D, but D would make me go down, which might increase the time, so probably no D, only U and S.\n\nS would make me stay, increasing time.\n\nSo minimal H is 9 if I can go up without stopping.\n\nBut I need to check for each row at the time I am on it.\n\nAssume I go directly up: actions all U from t=60 to t=67, then at t=68, y=9.\n\nSequence:\n\nt=60: a=U, then at t=61, y=1\n\nAt t=61, I am on y=1, time T=61, Δt = T -60 =1\n\ny=1: freeway k=1, at Δt=1, is it safe? k=1 unsafe at 12,13,14; Δt=1 not in, so safe.\n\nThen t=61: a=U, to y=2 at t=62\n\nt=62: on y=2, k=2, Δt=2, k=2 unsafe at 12,13,14, so Δt=2 safe.\n\nt=62: a=U, to y=3 at t=63\n\nt=63: on y=3, k=3, Δt=3\n\nk=3 unsafe at Δt=0,1,2; at Δt=3, safe, since safe for Δt>=3.\n\nYes.\n\nt=63: a=U, to y=4 at t=64\n\nt=64: on y=4, k=4, Δt=4\n\nk=4 unsafe at 0,1,2; safe at Δt=4>3, safe.\n\nt=64: a=U, to y=5 at t=65\n\nt=65: on y=5, k=5, Δt=5\n\nk=5 same as k=3, unsafe at 0,1,2; safe at Δt=5, safe.\n\nt=65: a=U, to y=6 at t=66\n\nt=66: on y=6, k=6, Δt=6\n\nk=6 unsafe only at Δt=2; at Δt=6, safe.\n\nt=66: a=U, to y=7 at t=67\n\nt=67: on y=7, k=7, Δt=7\n\nk=7 unsafe at Δt=6,7,8\n\nΔt=7 is unsafe! Oh, problem.\n\nAt t=67, Δt=7, on y=7, which is unsafe because k=7 is occupied at Δt=7.\n\nSo collision.\n\nTherefore, I cannot be on y=7 at t=67.\n\nThen t=67: a=U, to y=8 at t=68? But at t=67 I am on y=7, which is unsafe.\n\nIn the sequence: at t=66, I am on y=6, then I choose a=U, so at t=67, I am on y=7.\n\nAnd at that time, Δt=7, y=7 is unsafe.\n\nSo I get hit.\n\nTherefore, direct path has problem at y=7, t=67.\n\nNow, if I continue: at t=67, I am on y=7, unsafe, so I die.\n\nI need to avoid that.\n\nPerhaps I can delay or something.\n\nMinimal H might be more than 9.\n\nI need to be on y=7 at a time when it is safe.\n\ny=7 is safe except when Δt=6,7,8.\n\nSo safe when Δt <=5 or Δt >=9.\n\nSimilarly, other rows.\n\nNow, I start at t=60, y=0.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nSince I have to go through each row, but I can skip rows? No, because I can only change by one each turn, so I must pass through each y from 0 to 9, but I can stay or go down, so I might not be on every row if I go down and up, but that would take more turns, so for minimal time, I should go directly up, but with possible waiting on safe rows.\n\nIn this case, for y=7, I need to be on it when Δt <=5 or Δt >=9.\n\nIn the direct path, at Δt=7, which is unsafe.\n\nΔt=7 corresponds to T=67.\n\nNow, if I can be on y=7 earlier or later.\n\nEarlier: at Δt<=5, T<=65.\n\nLater: Δt>=9, T>=69.\n\nNow, similarly, I need to consider the sequence.\n\nAlso, other rows have constraints.\n\nFor example, y=3,4,5 are unsafe at Δt=0,1,2, but since I start at y=0 at Δt=0, and I go to y=1 at Δt=1, etc., as before, I was on y=3 at Δt=3, which is safe.\n\nBut y=7 is the issue.\n\nAlso, y=8: freeway k=8, unsafe at Δt=12,13,14, so T=72,73,74.\n\nSince I want to go fast, Δt=12 might be late.\n\nNow, back to y=7.\n\nI need to be on y=7 at some T where Δt <=5 or >=9.\n\nSimilarly, y=6 is always safe except Δt=2, which is early.\n\ny=5 safe for Δt>=3, etc.\n\nNow, to minimize H, I should go up as fast as possible, but wait on some row to avoid being on y=7 at bad time.\n\nFor example, if I go directly, I reach y=6 at t=66, Δt=6.\n\nThen at t=66, on y=6, I can choose to go U to y=7, but at t=67, on y=7, Δt=7 unsafe.\n\nI could choose to stay at y=6 for some turns.\n\ny=6 is safe except at Δt=2, which is t=62, but now t=66, Δt=6, safe.\n\nSo I can stay at y=6.\n\nIf I stay at y=6 at t=66, then at t=67, still on y=6, Δt=7.\n\ny=6 at Δt=7: k=6, unsafe only at Δt=2, so at Δt=7, safe.\n\nThen at t=67, I can choose to go U to y=7 at t=68.\n\nt=68, on y=7, Δt=8.\n\nNow Δt=8, y=7: k=7 unsafe at Δt=6,7,8, so Δt=8 unsafe! Still bad.\n\nΔt=8 is also unsafe for y=7.\n\nSimilarly, if I stay longer.\n\nAt t=66, on y=6, Δt=6, safe.\n\nIf I stay at t=66: S, then at t=67, still y=6, Δt=7, safe.\n\nAt t=67, if I stay again, S, then t=68, y=6, Δt=8, safe.\n\nThen at t=68, go U to y=7 at t=69.\n\nt=69, on y=7, Δt=9.\n\nNow Δt=9, for y=7: k=7 unsafe at 6,7,8; Δt=9>8, so safe.\n\nThen at t=69, I can go U to y=8 at t=70.\n\nt=70, on y=8, Δt=10.\n\ny=8: k=8, unsafe at Δt=12,13,14; Δt=10<12, so safe.\n\nThen at t=70, go U to y=9 at t=71.\n\nt=71, y=9, which is safe, not a freeway.\n\nSo I reach at t=71.\n\nNow, how many turns? From t=60 to t=71, that's 11 turns? Let's see the actions.\n\nStart t=60: at y=0, do U to y=1 at t=61? Earlier I assumed going up directly until y=6.\n\nIn this sequence: from t=60 to t=65, I go up directly to y=6? Let's list.\n\nAt t=60: y=0, do U, to y=1 at t=61\n\nt=61: y=1, do U, to y=2 at t=62\n\nt=62: y=2, do U, to y=3 at t=63\n\nt=63: y=3, do U, to y=4 at t=64\n\nt=64: y=4, do U, to y=5 at t=65\n\nt=65: y=5, do U, to y=6 at t=66\n\nNow at t=66: y=6, now instead of going up, I stay: S, so y=7? No, S means stay, so y_{t+1} = y_t, so at t=67, still y=6.\n\nAction a_t: if S, y_{t+1} = y_t.\n\nSo t=66: a=S, then at t=67, y=6\n\nThen t=67: a=S, at t=68, y=6\n\nThen t=68: a=U, to y=7 at t=69\n\nt=69: on y=7, a=U, to y=8 at t=70\n\nt=70: on y=8, a=U, to y=9 at t=71\n\nAt t=71, y=9, reached.\n\nNow, at which times was I on which row:\n\nt=60: y=0, safe\n\nt=61: y=1, Δt=1, k=1 safe (not 12-14)\n\nt=62: y=2, Δt=2, k=2 safe\n\nt=63: y=3, Δt=3, k=3 safe (since >=3)\n\nt=64: y=4, Δt=4, k=4 safe\n\nt=65: y=5, Δt=5, k=5 safe\n\nt=66: y=6, Δt=6, k=6 safe (only unsafe at 2)\n\nt=67: y=6, Δt=7, safe\n\nt=68: y=6, Δt=8, safe? Δt=8, k=6, unsafe only at 2, so yes safe.\n\nt=69: y=7, Δt=9, k=7: unsafe at 6,7,8; Δt=9>8, so safe.\n\nt=70: y=8, Δt=10, k=8 unsafe at 12-14, Δt=10<12, safe.\n\nt=71: y=9, safe.\n\nNow, I reached at t=71, but I started at t=60, so H=11 turns? From t=60 to t=71, that's 11 actions? Let's see the sequence of actions.\n\nThe actions are from t=60 to t=70, and at t=71 I am at y=9, but the action at t=70 brings me to y=9 at t=71.\n\nThe number of turns H: I start at turn t=60, after H-1 actions, I am at y=9 at turn t=60 + (H-1).\n\nSet T = t_1 + H - 1 = 60 + H - 1, and y_T =9.\n\nAt T, I am at y=9.\n\nIn this case, at t=71, y=9, so T=71, so 60 + H -1 =71, so H-1=11, H=12? Messed up.\n\nDefine: I start at turn t_1=60, position (0,y) with y=0.\n\nAfter t=0 to H-1, I perform H actions: a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1}, and after that, at turn t_1 + H, I am at y=9? No.\n\nAfter action a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, at turn t_1 + H, I am at position.\n\nStart: at turn t_1, I am at initial position.\n\nI choose a_{t_1}, which determines y_{t_1 +1}.\n\nThen at turn t_1 +1, I am at y_{t_1 +1}, and so on.\n\nAfter H actions, I have performed a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1}, and at turn t_1 + H, I am at y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nI need y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nAnd I need the sequence from t=0 to H-1 relative to t_1, but with absolute turns.\n\nIn the answer, it should be for turns t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nIn my sequence: I start at t=60, y=0.\n\nAfter a_60: U, then at t=61, y=1\n\na_61: U, t=62, y=2\n\na_62: U, t=63, y=3\n\na_63: U, t=64, y=4\n\na_64: U, t=65, y=5\n\na_65: U, t=66, y=6\n\nNow, a_66: S, so at t=67, y=6 (since S, no change)\n\na_67: S, at t=68, y=6\n\na_68: U, at t=69, y=7\n\na_69: U, at t=70, y=8\n\na_70: U, at t=71, y=9\n\nNow, at t=71, y=9, reached.\n\nThe actions are from t=60 to t=70, that's 11 actions: t=60,61,62,63,64,65,66,67,68,69,70.\n\nt from 60 to 70 inclusive is 11 turns.\n\nH is the number of actions, so H=11.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =70, since last action at t=70, and at t=71 position.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =60 + H -1=70, so H-1=10, H=11.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, is this minimal? H=11.\n\nBut earlier with direct, I could have reached in 9 but failed at y=7.\n\nCan I do better than 11?\n\nPerhaps by going up faster or slower.\n\nAnother idea: since y=7 is unsafe at Δt=6,7,8, I could be on y=7 earlier.\n\nFor example, at Δt<=5.\n\nNow, Δt<=5 means T<=65.\n\nI start at t=60, y=0.\n\nIf I go up as fast as possible, I reach y=6 at t=66, which is Δt=6.\n\nBut y=7 at Δt<=5 would require being on y=7 by t=65.\n\nt=65, Δt=5.\n\nCan I be on y=7 at t=65?\n\nAt t=65, y=7, Δt=5.\n\nBut to be on y=7 at t=65, I need to have arrived at t=65 from t=64.\n\nAt t=64, I must be at y=6 or y=8? From which position I move to y=7.\n\nIf at t=64, I am at y=6, and I do U, then at t=65, y=7.\n\nSimilarly, if at t=64, y=8, do D, but going down not efficient.\n\nSo typically from y=6.\n\nBut to be at y=6 at t=64, so that I can go to y=7 at t=65.\n\nNow, at t=64, y=6, Δt=4.\n\ny=6 is safe at Δt=4.\n\nCan I reach y=6 by t=64?\n\nStart t=60, y=0.\n\nTo reach y=6 by t=64, that means in 4 turns, from y=0 to y=6, need 6 up moves, but only 4 turns? Impossible.\n\nFrom t=60 to t=64: actions at t=60,61,62,63 determine position at t=64.\n\nAt t=64, y= y after actions.\n\nStart t=60, after a_60, at t=61 y=?\n\nAfter a_61, t=62 y=?\n\nAfter a_62, t=63 y=?\n\nAfter a_63, t=64 y=?\n\nTo have y=6 at t=64, I need to increase y by 6 in 4 actions, but each action increases by at most 1, so maximum y at t=64 is 4, if all U.\n\ny=4 at t=64, not 6.\n\nCannot reach y=6 before t=66 with all U.\n\nt=66 is the earliest for y=6 with direct up.\n\nAt t=66, y=6, Δt=6.\n\nThen to be on y=7 at Δt<=5, but Δt<=5 means T<=65, but at t=65, if I were on y=7, but I can't be at y=7 before t=67? With direct, at t=67 y=7, but earlier impossible.\n\nIf I go up faster, but I can't, since only one per turn.\n\nUnless I start from lower, but I start at y=0.\n\nSo impossible to be on y=7 at or before t=65.\n\nTherefore, the earliest safe time for y=7 is t=69, as I had, with Δt=9.\n\nIn my sequence, I reached at t=71.\n\nBut perhaps I can be on y=7 later but start later, but I start at t=60.\n\nAnother option: I could wait on an earlier row to delay the arrival on y=7.\n\nFor example, if I wait on y=5 or something.\n\nBut in my sequence, I waited on y=6 from t=66 to t=68, three turns, to reach y=7 at t=69.\n\nt=66 to t=68 is two stays? From t=66 to t=67 stay, t=67 to t=68 stay, so two extra turns.\n\nThen from y=6 to y=7 at t=69, then to y=8 at t=70, y=9 at t=71.\n\nTotal from start to end: 11 turns.\n\nBut H=11.\n\nCan I wait less?\n\ny=7 is unsafe from Δt=6 to 8, T=66 to 68.\n\nAt T=66, Δt=6, unsafe; T=67, Δt=7 unsafe; T=68, Δt=8 unsafe.\n\nSafe at T=65 or earlier, but impossible, or T=69 or later.\n\nSo I need to be on y=7 at T=69 or later.\n\nThe earliest is T=69.\n\nNow, to be on y=7 at T=69, I need to arrive at T=69.\n\nSo from start, I need to reach y=7 at t=69.\n\nSince I go up, I need to be at y=6 at t=68, then U to y=7 at t=69.\n\nSimilarly, to be at y=6 at t=68.\n\nNow, from y=0 to y=6, minimum 6 moves, so at t=66, I can be at y=6 with all U.\n\nBut at t=66, y=6, then if I go directly, I would be at y=7 at t=67, but t=67 is unsafe.\n\nSo I need to stay somewhere to delay.\n\nFor example, at t=66, I am at y=6, instead of going up, I stay, so at t=67, y=6.\n\nThen at t=67, I stay again? If I stay at t=67, at t=68 y=6, then at t=68, I go U to y=7 at t=69.\n\nAs before.\n\nI could stay at an earlier row.\n\nFor example, suppose at some point I stay on y=5 or something.\n\nBut let's see if I can save a turn.\n\nSuppose I reach y=6 earlier, but I can't.\n\nAll paths to y=6 take at least 6 steps from start.\n\nAt t=60 start y=0.\n\nAfter 6 actions, at t=66 y=6.\n\nThen from there, to be on y=7 at t=69, I need to spend 3 turns from t=66 to t=68 doing something else, like staying or moving down, but moving down would make it worse.\n\nSo I need at least 3 extra turns: two stays and one up, but in terms of time, from t=66 to t=69 for y=7, that is 3 turns: at t=66 I am at y=6, t=67 at y=6 or other, but to be at y=7 at t=69, I need to be at y=6 at t=68, so from t=66 to t=68, I must be at y=6 or lower, but if I go down, it takes more to come back, so best to stay at y=6 for two turns: t=66 and t=67, then at t=68 go to y=7? At t=68, from y=6, U, to y=7 at t=69.\n\nThen at t=69, y=7, safe.\n\nThen to y=8 at t=70, y=9 at t=71.\n\nSame as before.\n\nI could go to y=8 directly, but y=8 has unsafe times at Δt=12,13,14.\n\nIn this sequence, at t=70, I am on y=8, Δt=10, which is safe.\n\nBut if I could be on y=7 at t=69, and go up immediately.\n\nBut y=8 at Δt=10, safe.\n\nNow, another thing: when I go to y=8, at t=70, Δt=10, safe.\n\nBut if I want to minimize, I could go to y=9 faster from there.\n\nBut I need to be on y=8 first.\n\nPerhaps I can avoid y=7 or something, but I have to pass through it.\n\nUnless I go down, but no.\n\nAnother idea: since y=6 is safe most times, I could stay there longer, but that delays more.\n\nOr, for y=8, unsafe at Δt=12,13,14, so if I reach late, it might be unsafe.\n\nBut in this case, at t=70, Δt=10<12, safe.\n\nIf I go slower, Δt might be larger.\n\nFor example, if I take more time, at t=72, Δt=12, y=8 might be unsafe.\n\nBut in this case, I reach y=8 at t=70, Δt=10<12, safe.\n\nNow, back to y=7: I need to be on it at T=69 or later.\n\nT=69 is possible with waiting.\n\nBut is there a way to be on y=7 at T=69 with less than 11 turns total?\n\nTotal turns: from t=60 to t=71 for position, but actions until t=70.\n\nNumber of actions: 11 as above.\n\nPerhaps I can start later, but I start at t=60.\n\nAnother thought: at the beginning, I can wait at y=0.\n\ny=0 is safe, no cars.\n\nBut if I wait at y=0, I start later, so it might not help.\n\nFor example, at t=60, I do S, stay at y=0, then at t=61 still y=0.\n\nThen I go up, but I arrive at later times.\n\nFor instance, if I stay at t=60, S, then at t=61 y=0.\n\nThen I can go up from there.\n\nBut now, when I reach y=7, it might be at higher Δt.\n\nFor example, start: t=60: S, to t=61 y=0\n\nt=61: U, to t=62 y=1\n\nt=62: U, to t=63 y=2\n\n...\n\nBut now, at t=61, I am at y=0, but y=0 safe.\n\nThen t=61: U, to y=1 at t=62\n\nΔt= t-60, at t=62, Δt=2, y=1, safe.\n\nThen similarly, I reach y=6 at t=67? Let's see:\n\nt=60: S, t=61 y=0\n\nt=61: U, t=62 y=1\n\nt=62: U, t=63 y=2\n\nt=63: U, t=64 y=3\n\nt=64: U, t=65 y=4\n\nt=65: U, t=66 y=5\n\nt=66: U, t=67 y=6\n\nThen at t=67, y=6, Δt=7\n\nNow, to go to y=7, but at t=68, if I go U, y=7 at t=68, Δt=8, unsafe.\n\nIf I stay at y=6: t=67: S, t=68 y=6\n\nt=68: S, t=69 y=6? Or go U.\n\nAt t=68: if S, t=69 y=6\n\nThen t=69: U, to y=7 at t=70\n\nt=70: on y=7, Δt=10\n\nNow Δt=10, y=7: unsafe at 6,7,8; 10>8, safe.\n\nThen t=70: U, to y=8 at t=71\n\nt=71: y=8, Δt=11, k=8 unsafe at 12-14, Δt=11<12, safe? 11<12, yes.\n\nt=71: U, to y=9 at t=72\n\nReached at t=72.\n\nBut now I started with a wait, so later: t=72 vs previous t=71.\n\nWorse.\n\nIf at t=67, after reaching y=6 at t=67, I go directly to y=7 at t=68, but unsafe.\n\nOr, from above, at t=67 y=6, I can go U to y=7 at t=68, unsafe.\n\nSo I have to wait.\n\nIn the first sequence without initial wait, I reached at t=71.\n\nNow, can I save a turn by waiting on a different row?\n\nFor example, suppose on y=5, I stay for one turn.\n\nBut y=5 is safe for Δt>=3, which is fine.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nStart: t=60: U, t=61 y=1\n\nt=61: U, t=62 y=2\n\nt=62: U, t=63 y=3\n\nt=63: U, t=64 y=4\n\nt=64: U, t=65 y=5\n\nNow at t=65, y=5, Δt=5, safe.\n\nInstead of going up, I stay: a= S, so t=66 y=5\n\nt=66: on y=5, Δt=6, safe.\n\nThen t=66: U, to y=6 at t=67\n\nt=67: on y=6, Δt=7, safe (k=6 only unsafe at 2)\n\nThen at t=67, I need to go to y=7, but at t=68, y=7, Δt=8, unsafe.\n\nIf I go U at t=67, to y=7 at t=68, unsafe.\n\nSo I still need to wait on y=6.\n\nAt t=67, I can stay: S, so t=68 y=6\n\nThen t=68: U, to y=7 at t=69\n\nt=69: y=7, Δt=9, safe.\n\nThen t=69: U, to y=8 at t=70\n\nt=70: y=8, Δt=10, safe\n\nt=70: U, to y=9 at t=71? At t=70, I am on y=8, I do U, so at t=71 y=9.\n\nSame as before: reached at t=71.\n\nAnd I used one extra stay at y=5, but still same arrival time.\n\nIn this case, I stayed at y=5 one turn, but I arrived at y=5 at t=65, stayed, so y=6 at t=67, then stayed again or something, but in this sequence, from t=65 S, t=66 y=5, then U to y=6 at t=67, then at t=67, I have to stay or go, but I stayed implicitly by not going up immediately.\n\nIn this, at t=67, I am at y=6, then I need to go to y=7 at safe time.\n\nIf I go U at t=67, to y=7 at t=68, unsafe.\n\nSo I must stay at t=67: S, to t=68 y=6, then U to y=7 at t=69.\n\nThen same as before.\n\nSo no gain.\n\nPerhaps I can reach y=8 faster or something.\n\nBut y=8 must be safe.\n\ny=8 unsafe at Δt=12,13,14.\n\nIn the sequence, at t=70, Δt=10<12, safe.\n\nIf I can be on y=8 earlier, but to be on y=8, I need to come from y=7 or y=9, but y=9 not yet.\n\nAt t=68, if I could be on y=8, but from y=7 at t=67, but y=7 at t=67 unsafe, or from y=6 at t=67, I can only go to y=7 or y=5, not directly to y=8.\n\nSo impossible to skip rows.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 11.\n\nBut let me confirm the sequence.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn t_1 =60: a_{60} = U  (to y=1 at t=61)\n\nIn the sequence, I need to output actions from t_1 to t_1 + H-1.\n\nH=11, so actions from t=60 to t=70.\n\nList:\n\nTurn 60: U  (after action, at t=61 y=1)\n\nBut at the turn, when I perform action.\n\nIn the answer, it should be like:\n\nTurn 60: a_{60}\n\nTurn 61: a_{61}\n\netc.\n\nIn my sequence:\n\na_60: U\n\na_61: U\n\na_62: U\n\na_63: U\n\na_64: U\n\na_65: U\n\na_66: S  (stay at y=6)\n\na_67: S  (stay at y=6)\n\na_68: U  (to y=7)\n\na_69: U  (to y=8)\n\na_70: U  (to y=9)\n\nAt t=71, y=9.\n\nNow, check safety:\n\nt=60: y=0, safe\n\nt=61: y=1, Δt=1, k=1 safe (unsafe at 12-14, not)\n\nt=62: y=2, Δt=2, k=2 safe (same)\n\nt=63: y=3, Δt=3, k=3 safe (unsafe at 0,1,2; 3>2, safe)\n\nt=64: y=4, Δt=4, k=4 same as k=3, safe\n\nt=65: y=5, Δt=5, k=5 safe\n\nt=66: y=6, Δt=6, k=6 unsafe only at 2, safe\n\nt=67: y=6, Δt=7, safe\n\nt=68: y=6, Δt=8, safe\n\nt=69: y=7, Δt=9, k=7 unsafe at 6,7,8; 9>8, safe\n\nt=70: y=8, Δt=10, k=8 unsafe at 12-14, 10<12, safe\n\nt=71: y=9, safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nBut in the sequence, at t=68, I am still on y=6, and I go to y=7 at t=69.\n\nNow, is there a sequence with H=10?\n\nSuppose H=10, then I reach y=9 at t=70, since t_1 + H =60 +10=70.\n\nt_1 + H = position at turn t_1 + H.\n\nStart at t_1=60, after H actions, at turn t_1 + H.\n\nSet t_1 + H =70, so y=9 at t=70.\n\nThen I must be at y=8 at t=69, since I go U from there.\n\nAt t=69, y=8, Δt=9.\n\ny=8: k=8, unsafe at Δt=12,13,14; Δt=9<12, so safe.\n\nThen at t=69, I need to be at y=8.\n\nHow to get to y=8 at t=69.\n\nI must be at y=7 at t=68, and go U to y=8 at t=69.\n\nAt t=68, y=7, Δt=8.\n\ny=7: k=7, unsafe at Δt=6,7,8; so Δt=8 unsafe!\n\nProblem.\n\nIf I am at y=7 at t=68, it is unsafe.\n\nTo be at y=8 at t=69, I need to come from y=7 at t=68, but y=7 at t=68 is unsafe.\n\nIf I come from y=9, but not yet.\n\nSo impossible to be at y=8 at t=69 without being on y=7 at t=68.\n\nAnd at t=68, y=7 is unsafe.\n\nTherefore, I cannot reach y=9 at t=70, because it requires being on y=7 at t=68, which is unsafe.\n\nWith H=10, t_1 + H =70, so position at t=70 is y=9.\n\nThen at t=69, I must be at y=8, and do U to y=9 at t=70.\n\nAt t=69, y=8, which is safe as above.\n\nBut to be at y=8 at t=69, I must have been at y=7 at t=68, and done U to y=8 at t=69.\n\nAt t=68, I am on y=7, Δt=8, which is unsafe for y=7.\n\nCollision.\n\nIf at t=68, I am on y=7 and do U, but I am on y=7 at that turn, so I get hit.\n\nTherefore, impossible to be at y=8 at t=69 without passing through y=7 at t=68 when it is unsafe.\n\nHence, H=10 is impossible.\n\nSimilarly, for H=11, it works as above.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 11.\n\nIn the sequence, I have two S actions at t=66 and t=67.\n\nIn the answer, I need to output the actions.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 7, there was a car at (-24,-35,right,4), which I considered.\n\nAlso, other cars.\n\nIn the sequence, when I was on y=6 at t=66,67,68, it was safe, and y=7 at t=69 safe, etc.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nNow, for the answer format.\n\nIt should be:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 60: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 61: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 62: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 63: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 64: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 65: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 66: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 67: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 68: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 69: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 70: U \\end{array} }\n\nIn the box, it should be the actions for turns t_1 to t_1 + H-1, which is 60 to 70.\n\nAnd H=11.\n\nIn the sequence, from turn 60 to 70, that's 11 turns.\n\nYes.\n\nPerhaps I can have a different sequence with same H.\n\nBut this should work.\n\nAnother thing: at the beginning, for y=3,4,5, they were unsafe at Δt=0,1,2, but I was on them at Δt=3,4,5, which is safe, so no issue.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nSo I think this is the minimal.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 60\\) is 11. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\) by waiting on row \\(y = 6\\) during turns when row \\(y = 7\\) is unsafe.\n\n- **Safety Analysis for Key Rows**:\n  - **Row \\(y = 7\\) (freeway 7)**: Unsafe at \\(\\Delta t = 6, 7, 8\\) (turns 66, 67, 68) due to car occupation at \\(x = 0\\).

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) at turn 66 to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to 8. The player moves up, down, or stays, changing y by +1, -1, or 0 each turn, and y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars move left or right with given speeds. For collision, it only matters if I'm on a freeway y at turn T, and for that freeway, if 0 is in the span of any car at that turn.\n\nImportant point: when I move to a new row, I'm not on that new row until the next turn. So if I move from y to y+1 at turn T, I'm still on row y at turn T, and only on row y+1 at turn T+1. So I don't collide with cars on row y+1 at turn T.\n\nThe goal is to reach y=9.\n\nFirst, I need to model where the cars are at future turns relative to turn t1=66.\n\nLet me denote the time since t1 as t. So at turn t1 + t, for t=0,1,2,... we have turn number T = 66 + t.\n\nFor each freeway k from 1 to 8, I have the car states at t1=66.\n\nFor a car, given head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s.\n\nDirection: right means moving right, so increasing x, left means moving left, decreasing x.\n\nIn the span update:\n\nLeft-moving: Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nSince it's moving left, h and τ decrease.\n\nSimilarly, right-moving: Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]? Let me read carefully.\n\nFor left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ], and at T, [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nBut in the notation, for left-moving, h and τ are such that h > τ? Because it says head and tail, but in the span, for left-moving, it's [h, τ] with h and τ decreasing.\n\nIn the car state, it's given as (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s).\n\nFor left-moving, head is at the front when moving left, so if moving left, head should have higher x, but when it moves left, both decrease.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving.\n\nIn the update:\n\nLeft-moving: Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nThis implies that at T=t1, it's [h, τ], so if moving left, h is the right end, τ is the left end? Let's see the values.\n\nFor example, freeway 6: (48, 83, left, 36)\n\n48 and 83, with left direction.\n\nAt t1, span [h, τ] = [48, 83]? But 48 to 83, that would be from 48 to 83, which is increasing, but moving left? That doesn't make sense.\n\nI think there might be a confusion in head and tail.\n\nLet me read the car update rules again.\n\nFor car k on freeway i, suppose its head is at h, tail is at τ at turn t1.\n\nThen for left-moving: Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nAt T=t1, this is [h, τ].\n\nIf moving left, the head should be the one leading to the left, so if moving left, head should have smaller x? Let's see the values.\n\nFor freeway 6: (48, 83, left, 36)\n\nAt t1, span [48, 83], but 48 to 83 is from left to right if x increases to the right, but moving left? Moving left means decreasing x, so the car should be moving towards negative x.\n\nBut [48,83] at t1, then at later T, [48 - s(T-t1), 83 - s(T-t1)], so for example, at T=t1, position 48 and 83, both decrease as T increases, so the car is moving left, with head at 83? I'm confused.\n\nPerhaps head and tail are defined with respect to direction.\n\nIn the problem, it says \"head\" and \"tail\", but for left-moving, head might be the front when moving left, so lower x if x increases to the right.\n\nAssume x increases from left to right.\n\nSo for a car moving left, the head is on the left, tail on the right. So at position, head x is smaller, tail x is larger.\n\nFor example, if head at 10, tail at 20, moving left, then span [10,20], but head at 10, tail at 20, moving left, so the left end is head at 10, right end at 20.\n\nThen moving left, both decrease.\n\nIn the notation for freeway 6: (48, 83, left, 36), so head=48, tail=83, but 48 < 83, so head at 48, tail at 83, so left end 48, right end 83, moving left, so span [48,83].\n\nThen at T, span [48 - 36(T-t1), 83 - 36(T-t1)]\n\nSimilarly for right-moving.\n\nFor right-moving, it says: Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]? Let's see.\n\nFrom the text: \"Right-moving: [Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\"\n\nIn the car state, it's given as (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s), but for right-moving, Span(t1) is [τ, h], so τ and h are such that for right-moving, τ is the left end, h is the right end? Let's see an example.\n\nFor example, freeway 1: (-48, -59, right, 4)\n\nHead h = -48, tail τ = -59, direction right.\n\nSpan(t1) for right-moving is [τ, h] = [-59, -48]? τ = -59, h = -48, so [ -59, -48 ], which is from left to right, and moving right, so both increase.\n\nThen at T, [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] = [-59 + 4(T-t1), -48 + 4(T-t1)]\n\nSimilarly for other cars.\n\nIn general, for any car, the span at time T is given by:\n\nLet delta_t = T - t1\n\nFor left-moving car: span = [h - s * delta_t, τ - s * delta_t]\n\nFor right-moving car: span = [τ + s * delta_t, h + s * delta_t]\n\nAnd collision if player is on freeway k at turn T, and 0 in span of any car on k at T.\n\nPlayer is on freeway y at turn T if position is (0,y).\n\nNow, for the player, at turn T, y_T is the row, and we need to not have collision on that row at that turn.\n\nNow, the key point is when moving between rows.\n\nIf at turn T, player is on row y, and action a_T, then y_{T+1} = y_T + delta y.\n\nAt turn T, player is on row y_T, so we check collision on row y_T at turn T.\n\nThen after action, at turn T+1, player is on row y_{T+1}, so check row y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nWhen moving, at the moment of move, during turn T, after action, position is updated, but for collision, it says \"at turn T\", and \"you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T\", so at turn T, you are on y_T, even after action, I think, but let's read.\n\nThe note: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 in span at T but not at T+1.\"\n\nSo, at turn T, regardless of action, the player is on row y_T for the purpose of collision check at turn T. The action affects y_{T+1}, but at turn T, position is (0, y_T), and we check for row y_T at turn T.\n\nThen at turn T+1, position is (0, y_{T+1}), check row y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nSo, when you move, you are only on one row per turn.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=0 at t=0 (relative time, t=0 is turn 66) to y=9 at some turn H.\n\nStart at t=0, y=0.\n\nEnd when y=9, at that turn, we need to be on row 9, and not collide, so we must check row 9 at that turn.\n\nNow, minimal H.\n\nFirst, let's list all cars for each freeway at t1=66.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: head=-48, tail=-59, direction=right, speed=4\n\nSo right-moving, span at time T: [τ + s delta_t, h + s delta_t] = [-59 + 4 delta_t, -48 + 4 delta_t]\n\nFreeway 2: same as freeway 1? (-48, -59, right, 4) same as above.\n\nFreeway 3: two cars: (48, 37, right, 4) and (0, -11, right, 4)\n\nFirst car: (48,37,right,4) — head=48, tail=37, direction right.\n\nFor right-moving, span(t1) = [τ, h] = [37,48]? τ=37, h=48, so [37,48]\n\nAt T: [37 + 4 delta_t, 48 + 4 delta_t]\n\nSecond car: (0, -11, right, 4) — head=0, tail=-11, direction right.\n\nSpan(t1) = [τ, h] = [-11, 0]\n\nAt T: [-11 + 4 delta_t, 0 + 4 delta_t]\n\nFreeway 4: same as freeway 3? (48,37,right,4) and (0,-11,right,4) same.\n\nFreeway 5: same as 3 and 4? All have the same cars? Let's see.\n\nFreeway 5: (48,37,right,4), (0,-11,right,4) same as 3 and 4.\n\nBut freeway 3,4,5 all have identical cars? That seems odd, but possible.\n\nFreeway 6: one car: (48,83,left,36) head=48, tail=83, left direction.\n\nLeft-moving, span at t1: [h, τ] = [48,83]\n\nAt T: [48 - 36 delta_t, 83 - 36 delta_t]\n\nFreeway 7: three cars: (48,37,right,4), (12,1,right,4), (-24,-35,right,4)\n\nFirst car: (48,37,right,4) same as before, span at T: [37 + 4 delta_t, 48 + 4 delta_t]\n\nSecond car: (12,1,right,4) head=12, tail=1, direction right, span(t1) = [τ, h] = [1,12], at T: [1 + 4 delta_t, 12 + 4 delta_t]\n\nThird car: (-24,-35,right,4) head=-24, tail=-35, direction right, span(t1) = [τ, h] = [-35,-24], at T: [-35 + 4 delta_t, -24 + 4 delta_t]\n\nFreeway 8: (-48,-59,right,4) same as freeway 1 and 2.\n\nNow, for collision, we care when 0 is in the span for a car on the freeway we are on at turn T.\n\nSince the player is at x=0 always, we need to avoid that at turn T, on row y_T, 0 is in any car span on that row.\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need to find when 0 is covered by a car, i.e., when for some car, min_span <= 0 <= max_span.\n\nThen, for that freeway, at times when 0 is covered, it is dangerous only if player is on that row at that time.\n\nOtherwise, safe.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway k, the set of delta_t where 0 is in some car's span on k.\n\nStart with freeway 1: one car, span [ -59 + 4 delta_t, -48 + 4 delta_t ]\n\n0 in span if -59 + 4 delta_t <= 0 <= -48 + 4 delta_t\n\nSince -59 + 4d <= 0 <= -48 + 4d\n\nFirst inequality: -59 + 4d <= 0 => 4d <= 59 => d <= 59/4 = 14.75, so d <= 14 since integer? delta_t is integer, time turns.\n\nT and delta_t are integers, since turns.\n\nSo delta_t integer.\n\n-59 + 4d <= 0 => 4d <= 59 => d <= 14.75, so d <= 14\n\n0 <= -48 + 4d => 4d >= 48 => d >= 12\n\nAlso, since the span is [low, high] with low <= high, here -59+4d to -48+4d, difference 11, so for d from 12 to 14 inclusive.\n\nCheck d=12: low = -59 + 48 = -11, high = -48 + 48 = 0, so [-11,0], 0 is included.\n\nd=13: low = -59 + 52 = -7, high = -48 + 52 = 4, [-7,4], 0 in.\n\nd=14: low = -59 + 56 = -3, high = -48 + 56 = 8, [-3,8], 0 in.\n\nd=15: low = -59+60=1, high=-48+60=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nd=11: low=-59+44=-15, high=-48+44=-4, [-15,-4], 0 not in.\n\nSo for freeway 1, dangerous at delta_t = 12,13,14.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same as freeway 1, so dangerous at delta_t=12,13,14.\n\nNow freeway 3: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (48,37,right,4) span [37 + 4 delta_t, 48 + 4 delta_t]\n\n0 in this if 37 + 4d <= 0 <= 48 + 4d\n\nBut 37 + 4d <= 0? 4d <= -37, d <= -9.25, impossible since delta_t >=0.\n\nSimilarly, 0 <= 48 + 4d always true for d>=0, but min is 37+4d >=37>0, so 0 never in this span.\n\nSecond car: (0,-11,right,4) span [-11 + 4 delta_t, 0 + 4 delta_t] = [-11 + 4d, 4d]\n\n0 in this if -11 + 4d <= 0 <= 4d\n\nLeft: -11+4d <=0 => 4d <=11 => d <= 2.75, so d<=2\n\nRight: 0 <= 4d always for d>=0.\n\nSo for d=0,1,2.\n\nd=0: span [-11,0], 0 in\n\nd=1: span [-11+4, 0+4] = [-7,4], 0 in\n\nd=2: span [-11+8, 0+8] = [-3,8], 0 in\n\nd=3: span [-11+12, 0+12] = [1,12], 0 not in\n\nd=-1 not possible.\n\nSo only car 2 dangerous at d=0,1,2.\n\nThus for freeway 3, dangerous when delta_t=0,1,2 because of the second car.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 4: same as freeway 3, dangerous at delta_t=0,1,2.\n\nFreeway 5: same, dangerous at delta_t=0,1,2.\n\nNow freeway 6: one car (48,83,left,36) span at T: [48 - 36 delta_t, 83 - 36 delta_t]\n\n0 in this if 48 - 36d <= 0 <= 83 - 36d\n\nFirst inequality: 48 - 36d <= 0 => 48 <= 36d => d >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈1.333, so d>=2\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= 83 - 36d => 36d <= 83 => d <= 83/36 ≈ 2.305, so d<=2\n\nThus d=2 exactly.\n\nd=2: low = 48 - 72 = -24, high = 83 - 72 = 11, [-24,11], 0 in.\n\nd=1: low=48-36=12, high=83-36=47, [12,47], 0 not in.\n\nd=3: low=48-108=-60, high=83-108=-25, [-60,-25], 0 not in.\n\nSo only dangerous at delta_t=2.\n\nNow freeway 7: three cars.\n\nFirst car: (48,37,right,4) span [37+4d, 48+4d], min 37>0, so 0 never in.\n\nSecond car: (12,1,right,4) span [1 + 4d, 12 + 4d]\n\n0 in if 1+4d <=0 <=12+4d\n\n1+4d <=0? 4d <=-1, impossible.\n\n0 <=12+4d always, but min 1+4d >=1>0, so 0 never in.\n\nThird car: (-24,-35,right,4) span [-35 + 4d, -24 + 4d]\n\n0 in if -35 + 4d <= 0 <= -24 + 4d\n\nLeft: -35 + 4d <=0 => 4d <=35 => d <= 35/4=8.75, so d<=8\n\nRight: 0 <= -24 + 4d => 4d >=24 => d >=6\n\nAlso, span low to high, -35+4d to -24+4d.\n\nd=6: low=-35+24=-11, high=-24+24=0, [-11,0], 0 in\n\nd=7: low=-35+28=-7, high=-24+28=4, [-7,4], 0 in\n\nd=8: low=-35+32=-3, high=-24+32=8, [-3,8], 0 in\n\nd=5: low=-35+20=-15, high=-24+20=-4, [-15,-4], 0 not in\n\nd=9: low=-35+36=1, high=-24+36=12, [1,12], 0 not in\n\nSo dangerous for third car at d=6,7,8.\n\nThus freeway 7 dangerous at delta_t=6,7,8.\n\nFreeway 8: same as freeway 1, dangerous at delta_t=12,13,14.\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway, dangerous times (delta_t):\n\nFreeway 1: 12,13,14\n\nFreeway 2: 12,13,14\n\nFreeway 3: 0,1,2\n\nFreeway 4: 0,1,2\n\nFreeway 5: 0,1,2\n\nFreeway 6: 2\n\nFreeway 7: 6,7,8\n\nFreeway 8: 12,13,14\n\nNow, the player starts at y=0 at t=0 (delta_t=0).\n\nAt delta_t=0, position y=0.\n\nFreeway 0? But freeways are from 1 to 8, y=1 to 8.\n\ny=0 is not a freeway, it's the starting row, but no cars on y=0, I assume.\n\nSimilarly, y=9 is the goal, no cars.\n\nThe problem says freeways y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 have no cars, so always safe.\n\nAt turn T, if player is on y=0 or y=9, no collision possible.\n\nNow, we need to go from y=0 to y=9.\n\nEach move changes y by at most 1, so minimum turns to go from 0 to 9 is 9 turns if we move up every time, but we have to avoid the dangerous times on the rows we are on.\n\nSince we start at t=0, y=0, which is safe.\n\nAt t=0, delta_t=0, y=0, safe.\n\nNow, we need to reach y=9 at some turn.\n\nLet H be the number of turns from start, so we start at t=0, after H turns, we are at turn t1 + H, position should be (0,9) at that turn.\n\nAt time delta_t = H-1, we should be at y=9.\n\nSet t relative to start.\n\nAt time t (since t1), t=0,1,2,... position y_t.\n\nWe need y_{H-1} = 9 for some H, with y_0 = 0.\n\ny_t for t=0 to H-1, y_0=0, y_{H-1}=9.\n\nThe number of actions is H, from t=0 to t=H-1.\n\nWe need to find a sequence of actions a_0 to a_{H-1} such that y_t in [0,9] for all t, and at each turn t, when on row y_t, if y_t between 1 and 8, not dangerous at that delta_t.\n\ndelta_t is the same as t, since t1 + t, delta_t = t.\n\nIn my notation, delta_t = T - t1, and at turn T, time since start is t = T - t1, so delta_t = t.\n\nSo at time t, if player on row k, 1<=k<=8, then t should not be in the dangerous set for k.\n\nNow, the dangerous times for each row:\n\nRow 1: dangerous at t=12,13,14\n\nRow 2: dangerous at t=12,13,14\n\nRow 3: dangerous at t=0,1,2\n\nRow 4: dangerous at t=0,1,2\n\nRow 5: dangerous at t=0,1,2\n\nRow 6: dangerous only at t=2\n\nRow 7: dangerous at t=6,7,8\n\nRow 8: dangerous at t=12,13,14\n\nAnd row 0 and 9 always safe.\n\nWe start at t=0, y=0, safe.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at some t.\n\nSince we can only change y by -1,0,+1 each turn, the path must go through each row, but we can stay or move up/down, so we might not visit all rows, or stay multiple turns.\n\nBut to minimize H, probably we want to go up as fast as possible, but avoid the dangerous times.\n\nFirst, note that at t=0,1,2, rows 3,4,5 are dangerous, but we start at y=0, so at t=0, we are on y=0, safe.\n\nNow, we need to move to higher rows.\n\nBut at t=0,1,2, if we are on row 3,4,5, we collide.\n\nSimilarly, row 6 dangerous only at t=2.\n\nRow 7 at t=6,7,8 dangerous.\n\nRows 1,2,8 dangerous at t=12,13,14.\n\nSince we start at y=0 at t=0, and we need to reach y=9, the minimal time to reach y=9 is 9 turns if we move up every turn: after 9 actions, at t=9, y=9.\n\nt from 0 to 8: actions at t=0 to 8, position at t=9 is after 9 actions.\n\nSet time: after t actions, we have done t moves, position at time t.\n\nAt time t=0: before any action, position (0,0)\n\nAfter action a_0 at turn t1 (t=0), position becomes y_1 at time t=1.\n\nStandard: let t be the time index.\n\nAt turn t (relative, t=0 is start), position y_t.\n\nAfter action a_t, y_{t+1} = y_t + delta y.\n\nWe start at t=0, y_0 = 0\n\nAfter H actions, at t=H, we have y_H.\n\nWe want y_H = 9 for some H.\n\nAt each turn t, for t=0 to H-1, we are at position y_t, and we need no collision at that position at time t.\n\nWhen we reach y_H=9, at turn t=H, we are on row 9, which is safe, so we don't care about collision at t=H for row 9, since no cars.\n\nBut at turn t=H, position y_H=9, and we are on row 9, safe, so no issue.\n\nThe collision check is for each turn from t=0 to t=H-1, when we are on y_t, and if 1<=y_t<=8, it must not be dangerous at time t.\n\nAt t=H, we are on y_H=9, safe, no need to check.\n\nIn the sequence, for turns t=0 to H-1, we are at positions y_t to y_{H-1}, and y_H=9.\n\ny_t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nAt t=H, we have reached, no action needed or something? Let's see.\n\nThe actions are from turn t1 to t1 + H -1, so H actions.\n\nAfter H actions, we are at turn t1 + H, position should be (0,9).\n\nIn terms of time, from t=0 to t=H, we have H+1 positions, but we start at t=0, end at t=H with y_H=9.\n\nBut the collision checks are for turns when we are on the row, which is from t=0 to t=H, but at t=H, we are on row 9, safe, so we only need to ensure safety from t=0 to t=H-1 for the rows we are on.\n\nSpecifically, for each turn tau from t1 to t1 + H -1, which is relative t from 0 to H-1, position at that turn.\n\nAt relative time t, position y_t, for t=0 to H-1.\n\nThen at turn t1 + H, position y_H=9, which is safe.\n\nSo we need to find y_t for t=0 to H-1, with y_0=0, y_H=9, and for each t, y_t integer 0-9, and |y_{t+1} - y_t| <=1, and if 1<=y_t<=8, then t not in dangerous set for row y_t.\n\ny_{t+1} - y_t = delta y based on action.\n\nNow, to minimize H, the number of actions, which is also the number of turns from start to end turn, but since we start at turn t1, end at turn t1 + H, with H actions.\n\nH is the number of turns we take actions, from t=0 to t=H-1 relative.\n\nMinimal H is at least 9, if we go up directly.\n\nCan we go up directly in 9 turns?\n\nThat is, y_t = t for t=0 to 9, so at time t, on row t.\n\nThen we need to check for each row at time t.\n\nFor row 1 at t=1: dangerous times for row 1 are t=12,13,14, t=1 not in, so safe.\n\nSimilarly row 2 at t=2: dangerous t=12,13,14, not 2, safe.\n\nRow 3 at t=3: dangerous times t=0,1,2 for row 3. t=3 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly row 4 at t=4: dangerous t=0,1,2, t=4 not in, safe.\n\nRow 5 at t=5: dangerous t=0,1,2, t=5 not in, safe.\n\nRow 6 at t=6: dangerous only at t=2, t=6 not 2, safe.\n\nRow 7 at t=7: dangerous t=6,7,8. t=7 is in {6,7,8}, so dangerous! At t=7, on row 7, which is dangerous at t=7.\n\nCollision.\n\nSimilarly, row 8 at t=8: dangerous times t=12,13,14, t=8 not in, safe.\n\nBut row 7 at t=7 is dangerous.\n\nSo we cannot be on row 7 at t=7.\n\nIn direct path, at t=7, y=7, which is row 7, and t=7 is dangerous for row 7.\n\nSo we need to avoid that.\n\nWe could stay or move down to avoid being on row 7 at t=7.\n\nSince we want minimal H, we might delay or advance the time we are on certain rows.\n\nFor example, for row 7, dangerous at t=6,7,8.\n\nSo if we are on row 7 at t<6 or t>8, safe.\n\nSimilarly for other rows.\n\nNow, we start at t=0, y=0.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 by some t.\n\nMinimal t to reach y=9 is t=9, but at t=7, we have problem if on row 7.\n\nIn direct path, at t=7, we are on row 7.\n\nTo avoid, we could be on a different row at t=7.\n\nFor example, at t=7, if we are not on row 7, safe.\n\nBut we need to be on row 7 at some point to go to row 8 or 9.\n\nWe can skip row 7 or be on it at different time.\n\nSince we can move up or down, we can adjust.\n\nBut row 7 must be visited at some t not in {6,7,8}.\n\nSimilarly, for other constraints.\n\nList the constraints:\n\n- Cannot be on row 3,4,5 at t=0,1,2\n\n- Cannot be on row 6 at t=2\n\n- Cannot be on row 7 at t=6,7,8\n\n- Cannot be on row 1,2,8 at t=12,13,14\n\nBut t=12,13,14 might be late, since we want minimal H, probably H<12, so t=12 etc not reached.\n\nSimilarly, for row 3,4,5, dangerous at t=0,1,2, but we start at t=0 y=0, so as long as we are not on row 3,4,5 at t=0,1,2, which we aren't since y=0.\n\nAt t=0, y=0, not 3,4,5.\n\nWe can move to row 1 at t=1, for example.\n\nBut row 1 is only dangerous at t=12,13,14, which if H small, not issue.\n\nSimilarly row 2.\n\nThe main issue is row 7 at t=6,7,8.\n\nAlso row 6 at t=2.\n\nNow, to reach y=9 quickly.\n\nSuppose we go up as fast as possible but avoid row 7 at t=6,7,8.\n\nAt t=7, we should not be on row 7.\n\nIn the direct path, at t=7, y=7.\n\nTo not be on row 7 at t=7, we could:\n\n- Be on row 6 at t=7, then move to row 7 at t=8 or later.\n\n- Or be on row 8 at t=7, but at t=7, if y=8, that might be possible if we go faster.\n\n- Or stay on row 6 or 8.\n\nBut let's see the timing.\n\nFirst, row 6 is dangerous only at t=2, so at other times safe.\n\nRow 7 dangerous at t=6,7,8.\n\nWe need to be on row 7 at some t not in {6,7,8}.\n\nSimilarly, to go from row 6 to row 8, we must pass row 7 at some point.\n\nSince we can only change by 1, we must be on row 7 at some turn.\n\nSo let t7 be the turn when we are on row 7.\n\nThen t7 not in {6,7,8}, so t7 <=5 or t7 >=9.\n\nSimilarly, for other rows, but row 3,4,5 dangerous at t=0,1,2, but since we start from y=0, we can be on row 3,4,5 after t=2.\n\nFor example, at t=3, row 3 is safe, since dangerous only t=0,1,2.\n\nSimilarly row 4 and 5 safe after t=2.\n\nRow 6 safe except t=2.\n\nNow, minimal H: we need to reach y=9 at t=H.\n\ny_H=9.\n\nThe time to reach row 7.\n\nSince we must be on row 7 at t7 with t7 <=5 or t7 >=9.\n\nIf t7 <=5, then since we start at y=0, to reach row 7 by t=5, we need at least 7 moves up, so at t=7, y=7, but t=7>5, not <=5.\n\nt7 <=5 means at some t<=5, y_t=7.\n\nBut from t=0, y=0, to y=7 at t<=5, so in at most 5 steps, y increases by 7, so we need at least 7 up moves in 5 turns, impossible since each turn move up at most +1, so in 5 turns, max y=5, cannot reach y=7.\n\nSimilarly, min y at t=5 is 0, but we need y=7, impossible.\n\nSo t7 <=5 is impossible.\n\nTherefore, t7 must be >=9.\n\nSo we must be on row 7 at some t7 >=9.\n\nSimilarly, since we need to go to row 8 and 9, we will be on row 7 at t7 >=9.\n\nThen at that time, row 7 is safe since t7 >=9 not in {6,7,8}.\n\nNow, we also need to be on row 6 before row 7.\n\nRow 6 dangerous only at t=2, so we need to be on row 6 at some t not equal to 2.\n\nSimilarly, row 5,4,3,2,1 can be visited at safe times.\n\nNow, to minimize H, we want to reach y=9 as early as possible.\n\nBut since we have to delay row 7 until t>=9, we might arrive later.\n\nFor example, if we reach row 7 at t=9, then row 8 at t=10, row 9 at t=11, so H=11, y_{11}=9.\n\nCan we do better?\n\nPerhaps reach row 6 earlier and stay, or something.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nFirst, from start, we can go up to row 6 quickly, but avoid t=2 on row 6.\n\nThen stay or move to row 7 after t=8.\n\nBut row 7 safe after t=8.\n\nt>=9 for row 7? t7>=9.\n\nNow, let's find the earliest possible.\n\nStart at t=0, y=0.\n\nAt t=1, we can go to y=1 or stay y=0.\n\nRow 1 safe except t=12,13,14, which are late, so we can go up.\n\nSimilarly row 2 safe except t=12,13,14.\n\nSo let's go up directly to row 6.\n\nBut row 6 dangerous at t=2.\n\nSo we need to not be on row 6 at t=2.\n\nAt t=2, if we are on row 6, collide.\n\nSo at t=2, we should not be on row 6.\n\nPossible positions at t=2: y=0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 but since we start from 0, in two steps, y can be from 0 to 2, if move up twice.\n\nAt t=0, y=0\n\nt=1, after a_0, y1 = y0 + a0, a0=U,D,S, so y1 = 0,1, or if D, y1=-1? But y must be in [0,9], so cannot go below 0 or above 9.\n\nSo at t=1, y1 in {0,1} since from 0, can stay or up, not down.\n\nSimilarly, at t=2, y2 can be from min 0 to max 2.\n\nSpecifically, from y1, if y1=0, y2=0 or1; if y1=1, y2=0,1,2.\n\nBut row 3,4,5 dangerous at t=2? At t=2, if on row 3,4, or5, collide.\n\nBut at t=2, y2 <=2 since only two up moves, so y2 <=2, so row 3,4,5 not possible at t=2. Similarly row 6 not possible, y2<=2<6.\n\nSo at t=2, possible y2=0,1,2.\n\nRow 1 and 2 are safe at t=2, since dangerous only at t=12-14.\n\nRow 0 safe.\n\nSo no problem at t=2, whatever we are.\n\nBut row 6 dangerous at t=2, but we cannot be on row 6 at t=2 anyway since too low.\n\nSimilarly, at t=0 and t=1, we are low, safe.\n\nNow, we need to go up.\n\nBut for row 7, we need to be on it at t>=9.\n\nSo let's plan to reach row 6 as soon as possible, but not necessary.\n\nSince row 7 must be after t=8, we can go slowly to lower rows first or something, but that might increase time, not good for minimal H.\n\nBetter to go up to row 6 quickly, then stay until t=8, then move to row 7 at t=9 or later.\n\nBut row 6 safe except t=2, so we can stay on row 6 for multiple turns if needed.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, let's find the earliest time to reach row 6.\n\nWe start at t=0 y=0.\n\nAfter one action, t=1, y=1 (if up) or 0 (stay).\n\nBetter to move up.\n\nAssume we move up when possible.\n\na_t = U when possible.\n\nAt t=0, move U to y=1 at t=1.\n\nPosition at t=1: y=1, row 1, safe.\n\nt=1, row 1 dangerous only at t=12-14, not 1, safe.\n\nThen at t=1, action a1, if U, to y=2 at t=2.\n\nAt t=2, y=2, row 2, safe.\n\nThen continue.\n\nBut we need to be careful for row 6 and 7.\n\nAt t=2, y=2 if we moved up twice.\n\nThen at t=2, action a2, if U, to y=3 at t=3.\n\nAt t=3, y=3, row 3.\n\nNow, row 3 dangerous at t=0,1,2, but t=3 not in, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, at t=4, to y=4, row 4, safe since t=4>2.\n\nt=5, to y=5, row 5, safe.\n\nt=6, to y=6, row 6.\n\nAt t=6, row 6.\n\nRow 6 dangerous only at t=2, t=6≠2, safe.\n\nThen at t=6, on row 6.\n\nNow, we want to go to row 7.\n\nBut row 7 dangerous at t=6,7,8.\n\nSo at t=6, if we move U to row 7, then at t=7, position y=7, row 7, but t=7, which is dangerous, collide.\n\nIf we stay on row 6 at t=6, then at t=7, position y=6 (if stayed), row 6, safe.\n\nThen at t=7, we can move to row 7 or not.\n\nIf move to row 7 at t=7, then at t=7, position y=7, but t=7 dangerous for row 7, collide.\n\nIf we stay on row 6 at t=7, position y=6, safe.\n\nThen at t=8, if move to row 7, position at t=8 is y=7, row 7, t=8 dangerous, collide.\n\nIf stay, y=6.\n\nThen at t=9, move to row 7, position at t=9, y=7, row 7.\n\nt=9 not in {6,7,8}, so safe.\n\nThen at t=10, to y=8, row 8.\n\nRow 8 dangerous at t=12,13,14, t=10<12, safe.\n\nt=11, to y=9, row 9, safe.\n\nSo we reach y=9 at t=11.\n\nH=11, since y_11=9.\n\nActions from t=0 to t=10.\n\nt=0 to t=10, 11 actions, y at t=11.\n\nIn terms of turns: relative t from 0 to 10 for actions, positions from t=0 to t=11.\n\ny_t at t=11 is 9.\n\nNow, the sequence: from t=0 to t=5, move up each time: so y_t = t for t=0 to 5? t=0 y=0, t=1 y=1, t=2 y=2, t=3 y=3, t=4 y=4, t=5 y=5.\n\nThen at t=5, position y=5.\n\nAction at t=5: move U to y=6 at t=6.\n\nAt t=6, position y=6.\n\nNow, we need to stay on row 6 until t=8, then move to row 7 at t=9.\n\nAt t=6, position y=6.\n\nAction a6: if we do S, stay, then at t=7, position y=6.\n\nThen action a7: S, stay, at t=8 position y=6.\n\nThen action a8: U, to y=7 at t=9.\n\nAt t=9, position y=7.\n\nThen action a9: U, to y=8 at t=10.\n\nAt t=10, position y=8.\n\nThen action a10: U, to y=9 at t=11.\n\nAt t=11, y=9.\n\nNow, check safety:\n\nt=0: y=0, safe\n\nt=1: y=1, row1, safe (t=1 not 12-14)\n\nt=2: y=2, row2, safe\n\nt=3: y=3, row3, t=3>2, safe\n\nt=4: y=4, row4, safe\n\nt=5: y=5, row5, safe\n\nt=6: y=6, row6, t=6≠2, safe\n\nt=7: y=6, row6, safe (since stayed)\n\nt=8: y=6, row6, safe\n\nt=9: y=7, row7, t=9>8, safe\n\nt=10: y=8, row8, t=10<12, safe\n\nt=11: y=9, safe, no need to check.\n\nAll safe.\n\nH=11 actions.\n\nBut can we do better?\n\nPerhaps we can reach earlier by not going to row 6 at t=6.\n\nFor example, if we go slower in the beginning, we might reach row 7 later but directly to higher.\n\nBut since we have to delay row 7, probably not.\n\nSuppose we stay at y=0 for some turns, but that would make H larger, not smaller.\n\nFor example, if we stay at t=0, y=0, then later go up, we arrive later.\n\nWorse.\n\nOr move down, but that seems worse.\n\nPerhaps we can go to row 6 earlier.\n\nEarliest to reach row 6: if we move up every time, at t=6, y=6.\n\nAs above.\n\nAt t=5, y=5, if we move up at t=5, to y=6 at t=6.\n\nWe cannot reach earlier than t=6 for row 6.\n\nAt t=6, we are on row 6.\n\nThen we have to stay until t=8 to avoid row 7 during t=6,7,8.\n\nThen move at t=8 to row 7? At t=8, if we move to row 7, position at t=8 is y=7? Let's see.\n\nAt t=8, position: if at t=7 we were on row 6, and at t=7 action a7, if U, then y_{t=8} =7.\n\nAt turn t=8, position y=7, row 7.\n\nBut t=8 is in dangerous {6,7,8} for row 7, so collide.\n\nIf we move at t=8 to row 7, but at t=8, after action, position at t=9 is y=7.\n\nAt turn t=8, we are still on row 6, since we move during turn t=8.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t.\n\nAfter action a_t, y_{t+1} = y_t + delta y.\n\nAt turn t, we are at y_t.\n\nFor example, at t=7, if we are at y_7=6.\n\nThen during turn t=7, action a7.\n\nIf a7=S, then y8=6.\n\nIf a7=U, then y8=7.\n\nAt turn t=7, position is y7=6.\n\nAt turn t=8, position is y8, which could be 6 or 7.\n\nIf at t=7, we do U, then at t=8, position y8=7.\n\nThen at turn t=8, we are on row 7, and t=8, which is dangerous, collide.\n\nIf at t=7, we do S, then at t=8, y8=6.\n\nThen at turn t=8, position y8=6.\n\nThen action a8, if U, then y9=7.\n\nAt turn t=8, we are on row 6, safe.\n\nAt turn t=9, position y9=7, row 7, t=9, not dangerous, safe.\n\nSame as before.\n\nTo move to row 7 at t=9.\n\nWe cannot be on row 7 at t=6,7,8.\n\nSo earliest to be on row 7 is t=9.\n\nThen from there, to row 8 at t=10, row 9 at t=11.\n\nH=11 seems necessary.\n\nBut is there a way to reach row 9 before t=11?\n\nFor example, if we can be on row 7 at t=9, but then to row 9 at t=10? No, because we can only move to adjacent row.\n\nFrom row 7 at t=9, to row 8 at t=10, then to row 9 at t=11.\n\nCannot skip.\n\nPerhaps from row 6 to row 7 earlier, but we cannot because of danger.\n\nAnother idea: what if we go to row 8 or 9 before t=6, but impossible since start from 0.\n\nMax at t=6 is y=6.\n\nt=7 y=7, but cannot.\n\nSo no.\n\nPerhaps we can go to higher rows by staying on lower rows longer, but that delays the arrival.\n\nFor example, if we stay on row 5 for some turns, then go up later, but we reach row 7 later, which might be after t=8, but we can reach row 7 at t=9 as above, and if we stay longer, we arrive later.\n\nFor example, suppose at t=5, y=5, instead of moving up, we stay.\n\nThen at t=6, position y=5, row5, safe.\n\nThen at t=6, move U to y=6 at t=7.\n\nAt t=7, position y=6, row6, safe.\n\nThen at t=7, move U to y=7 at t=8? But at t=8, y=7, row7, t=8 dangerous, collide.\n\nSo we need to stay or something.\n\nIf at t=7, stay, y=6 at t=8.\n\nThen at t=8, move U to y=7 at t=9.\n\nThen same as before, but we wasted time staying at t=5 or something.\n\nIn this case, at t=5 we stayed, so at t=6 y=5, t=7 y=6, t=8 y=6, t=9 y=7, t=10 y=8, t=11 y=9, same H=11 but we stayed extra, no better.\n\nIf we go faster initially, but cannot.\n\nAnother thought: row 6 is only dangerous at t=2, but we are not there at t=2.\n\nIn the path, we are on row 6 from t=6 to t=8 in the first plan.\n\nBut at t=6,7,8 we are on row 6, which is safe except t=2, so ok.\n\nWe need to be on row 7 at t>=9.\n\nBut perhaps we can be on row 7 at t=9, but go directly to row 9? No.\n\nMaybe we can reach row 8 or 9 before the danger times, but row 8 dangerous at t=12-14, which is late.\n\nFor example, can we reach row 9 by t=8?\n\nTo reach y=9 at t=8, need to increase 9 in 8 steps, but from y=0, at t=8, y=8 max, since 8 up moves, y=8 at t=8.\n\ny_t at t=8 <=8.\n\ny=9 at earliest t=9.\n\nAt t=9, y=9 possible if we moved up all steps.\n\nBut at t=7, we need to be on row 7 or something.\n\nIf we move up all, at t=7, y=7, but t=7 dangerous for row 7.\n\nCannot.\n\nIf we are on row 8 at t=7.\n\nAt t=7, y=8 possible? From start, at t=7, after 7 moves, y=7 max, so y=8 at t=8 earliest.\n\nAt t=7, y<=7.\n\nSo we must be on row <=7 at t=7.\n\nRow 7 at t=7 dangerous.\n\nSo we cannot be on row 7 at t=7, and since y<=7, we must be on row <=6 at t=7.\n\nThen at t=8, we can be on row 7 or 8.\n\nBut if on row 7 at t=8, dangerous.\n\nIf on row 8 at t=8, then row 8 at t=8, dangerous times t=12-14, not 8, so safe.\n\nThen to row 9 at t=9.\n\nBut how to be on row 8 at t=8.\n\nWe need to reach row 8 at t=8.\n\nFrom start, at t=8, y=8.\n\nNow, to get there, we need to avoid being on row 7 at t=6,7,8.\n\nBut at t=7, we must be on row 7 or less.\n\nSince we go to row 8 at t=8, we must be on row 7 at some point.\n\nLet t be when on row 7.\n\nThen at that turn, if t=7, dangerous.\n\nIf t=6, on row 7 at t=6, dangerous.\n\nIf t=8, on row 7 at t=8, dangerous.\n\nt=8, if on row 7 at t=8, dangerous.\n\nBut to reach row 8 at t=8, we must have been on row 7 at t=7 or t=8.\n\nSpecifically, at turn t=7, position y7.\n\nIf y7=7, then to go to y8=8, we move up at t=7, so at t=8, y8=8.\n\nBut at t=7, we are on row 7, which is dangerous if t=7.\n\nIf y7=6, then at t=7 action U, to y8=7 at t=8.\n\nThen at t=8, on row 7, dangerous.\n\nIf y7=8, impossible at t=7.\n\nSo in all cases, to be on row 8 at t=8, we must have been on row 7 at t=7 or t=8, both dangerous times.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- If at t=7, y7=7, then on row 7 at t=7, dangerous.\n\n- If at t=7, y7=6, and move U, then at t=8, y8=7, on row 7 at t=8, dangerous.\n\n- If at t=7, y7=7 and move U, at t=8 y8=8, but at t=7 on row 7 dangerous.\n\nNo way to be on row 8 at t=8 without being on row 7 at a dangerous time.\n\nTherefore, we cannot reach row 8 at t=8 safely.\n\nSimilarly, cannot reach row 9 before t=11 in a safe way.\n\nThus, the minimal H is 11.\n\nIn the sequence we have, with staying on row 6 for two extra turns.\n\nBut in the sequence, we moved to row 6 at t=6, stayed at t=6 and t=7? Let's list the actions and positions.\n\nt: time, y_t position at start of turn or after action?\n\nAt turn t (relative), position y_t before action? I think I have confusion.\n\nDefine clearly.\n\nAt the beginning of turn t (relative time, t=0 is turn t1), player position is (0, y_t)\n\nThen player takes action a_t.\n\nThen position updates to y_{t+1} = y_t + delta y, with bounds.\n\nThen for collision, at turn t, we are on row y_t, and check for that row at time t.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nt=0: position y=0, take action a0=U (say), then y1=1\n\nt=1: position y=1, take action a1=U, then y2=2\n\n...\n\nUp to t=5: position y=5, take action a5=U, then y6=6\n\nt=6: position y=6, now we take action a6.\n\nIf a6=S, then y7=6\n\nt=7: position y=6, take action a7=S, then y8=6? No\n\nAt t=7, position y=6 (since y7=6), take action a7.\n\nIf a7=S, then y8=6\n\nIf a7=U, then y8=7\n\nBut we need to avoid moving to row 7 during t=6,7,8.\n\nIn the safe sequence, at t=6: position y=6, take action a6=S (stay), so y7=6\n\nt=7: position y=6, take action a7=S (stay), so y8=6\n\nt=8: position y=6, take action a8=U, so y9=7\n\nt=9: position y=7, take action a9=U, so y10=8\n\nt=10: position y=8, take action a10=U, so y11=9\n\nNow, at t=11, position y=9, done.\n\nActions: from t=0 to t=10.\n\nNumber of actions: 11.\n\nIn the answer, we need to list actions for turn t1 to t1+10.\n\nt1=66.\n\nBut let's confirm all collision checks.\n\nAt each turn t (relative):\n\nt=0: y=0, safe\n\nt=1: y=1, row1, not dangerous time, safe\n\nt=2: y=2, row2, safe\n\nt=3: y=3, row3, t=3 not in {0,1,2}, safe\n\nt=4: y=4, row4, safe (t=4>2)\n\nt=5: y=5, row5, safe\n\nt=6: y=6, row6, t=6 ≠2, safe\n\nt=7: y=6, row6, safe\n\nt=8: y=6, row6, safe\n\nt=9: y=7, row7, t=9 not in {6,7,8}, safe\n\nt=10: y=8, row8, t=10 not in {12,13,14}, safe\n\nt=11: y=9, safe, not checked or no issue.\n\nAll good.\n\nCan we save one turn?\n\nSuppose we go to row 7 at t=9, but then to row 9 at t=10? Impossible.\n\nPerhaps we can be on row 7 earlier if we come from above, but we start from below.\n\nAnother idea: what about moving down temporarily.\n\nFor example, suppose at some point we move down to avoid, but that might not help.\n\nFor instance, suppose we reach row 5 at t=5, but instead of going to row 6, we stay or move down, then later go up, but that would make us arrive later.\n\nFor example, at t=5, y=5, stay, then t=6 y=5, then t=7 move to y=6, t=8 y=6 or to y=7? If to y=7 at t=8, dangerous.\n\nSo must stay or go to y=6 at t=7, then to y=7 at t=9, same as before but delayed.\n\nWorse.\n\nPerhaps we can skip row 6 or something, but no, must pass through.\n\nSo H=11 seems minimal.\n\nBut in the sequence, we stayed on row 6 for t=6,7,8 positions, but actions at t=6 and t=7 are stay.\n\nBut we can have only one stay if we time differently.\n\nFor example, if we go to row 6 later.\n\nBut we reach at t=6 earliest.\n\nSuppose we delay going up.\n\nFor example, at t=0, stay at y=0.\n\nThen t=1: position y=0, action U to y=1? Not better.\n\nSuppose at t=2, we are at y=2.\n\nThen t=3 to y=3, t=4 y=4, t=5 y=5, t=6 y=6, same as before.\n\nNo gain.\n\nThus, minimal H is 11.\n\nNow, for the actions.\n\nIn the sequence above, actions:\n\nAt t=0 (turn 66): U\n\nt=1 (turn 67): U\n\nt=2 (turn 68): U\n\nt=3 (turn 69): U\n\nt=4 (turn 70): U\n\nt=5 (turn 71): U  // to y=6 at t=6\n\nt=6 (turn 72): S  // stay, y=6 at t=7\n\nt=7 (turn 73): S  // stay, y=6 at t=8\n\nt=8 (turn 74): U  // to y=7 at t=9\n\nt=9 (turn 75): U  // to y=8 at t=10\n\nt=10 (turn 76): U  // to y=9 at t=11\n\nNow, at turn t=76, position (0,9), reached.\n\nH=11 actions from turn 66 to 76? Turns: turn 66 to turn 76 inclusive? Let's see.\n\nActions from turn t1 to t1 + H -1.\n\nt1=66, H=11, so actions from turn 66 to 66+10=76.\n\nTurns: 66,67,68,69,70,71,72,73,74,75,76.\n\nAfter action at turn 76, position at turn 77? No.\n\nAt turn T, position is given, then action, then position updates.\n\nIn terms of the game turn:\n\nAt turn 66: position (0,0), take action a_{66}\n\nThen position updates to new position for next turn.\n\nAfter action at turn 66, position becomes for turn 67.\n\nTypically, at the start of turn T, position is set, then action taken, then position updates for turn T+1.\n\nBut for collision, at turn T, we are at position at start of turn.\n\nIn this case:\n\nStart of turn 66: position (0,0)\n\nTake action a_{66}, say U, then position for turn 67 is (0,1)\n\nSimilarly.\n\nAt turn 66, position (0,0), which is safe.\n\nAction U, then turn 67 position (0,1)\n\nAt turn 67, position (0,1), row 1, safe, action U, then turn 68 position (0,2)\n\n...\n\nAt turn 71: position (0,5), action U, then turn 72 position (0,6)\n\nAt turn 72: position (0,6), action S, then turn 73 position (0,6)\n\nAt turn 73: position (0,6), action S, then turn 74 position (0,6)\n\nAt turn 74: position (0,6), action U, then turn 75 position (0,7)\n\nAt turn 75: position (0,7), action U, then turn 76 position (0,8)\n\nAt turn 76: position (0,8), action U, then turn 77 position (0,9)\n\nBut we need to reach (0,9) at some turn, meaning at the start of that turn, position is (0,9).\n\nAt turn 77, position is (0,9), so we have reached.\n\nThe actions were from turn 66 to 76, which is 11 actions.\n\nAfter action at turn 76, position becomes (0,9) at turn 77.\n\nIn the sequence, we need to specify actions until we reach.\n\nNow, in the answer, it should be the actions for the turns.\n\nIn the format, it says: Turn t_1: a_{t1}, Turn t1+1: a_{t1+1}, etc.\n\nUntil the last action before reaching.\n\nHere, actions from turn 66 to 76.\n\nH=11.\n\nBut at turn 77, we don't take action, we are already there.\n\nIn the sequence above, with stays.\n\nBut we can have a different path with less stay, but H is the same.\n\nFor example, if we go to row 5 at t=5, but stay at row 5 for one turn, then go to row 6 at t=7, but later.\n\nt=0: U to y=1\n\nt=1: U to y=2\n\nt=2: U to y=3\n\nt=3: U to y=4\n\nt=4: U to y=5\n\nt=5: S (stay at y=5) // instead of moving to y=6\n\nThen at t=6: position y=5, action U to y=6 at t=7\n\nt=7: position y=6, action U? If U to y=7 at t=8, but at t=8 position y=7, dangerous.\n\nSo must stay or move later.\n\nIf at t=7: S, then y=6 at t=8\n\nt=8: position y=6, action U to y=7 at t=9\n\nThen same as before, but we have an extra stay at t=5, so we reach y=9 at t=11 still, but with y=5 at t=6, then y=6 at t=7, y=6 at t=8 (if stay), etc., so position at t=11 y=9, same H, but we have one more stay, no benefit.\n\nIn the first sequence, we have two stays on row 6.\n\nBut H is still 11.\n\nI think H=11 is minimal.\n\nNow, for the answer, we need to output the action sequence.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 72 and 73, we have S actions.\n\nBut we can have only one S if we can, but in this case, we need to wait until t=9 to be on row 7.\n\nSince we are on row 6 from t=6 to t=8, we need to stay for two turns if we don't move.\n\nBut we could move to another row and back, but that might not save time.\n\nFor example, from row 6 at t=6, move down to row 5 at t=7, then back to row 6 at t=8, then to row 7 at t=9.\n\nBut at t=7: from y=6, action D, to y=5 at t=7? Position.\n\nAt turn t=72 (t=6 relative): position (0,6), action D, then turn 73 position (0,5)\n\nAt turn 73: position (0,5), row 5, safe, action U, then turn 74 position (0,6)\n\nAt turn 74: position (0,6), action U, then turn 75 position (0,7)\n\nBut at turn 75 position (0,7), which is t=9 relative? Relative t: turn 66 is t=0, turn 67 t=1, ..., turn 75 is t=9? 75-66=9, yes.\n\nPosition at turn 75: (0,7), row 7, t=9 relative, safe.\n\nThen action U to turn 76 position (0,8)\n\nThen U to turn 77 (0,9)\n\nSame H=11 actions from turn 66 to 76.\n\nBut we used a down and up instead of two stays.\n\nBut in terms of actions, it's the same number.\n\nAnd we have to move, not necessarily better.\n\nIn the first sequence with two stays is fine.\n\nNow, in the car state, there was freeway 6 with a car, but we handled.\n\nAlso, for row 7, we avoided the danger times.\n\nI think it's correct.\n\nSo minimal H=11.\n\nNow, for the answer.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 66: U\n\nTurn 67: U\n\nTurn 68: U\n\nTurn 69: U\n\nTurn 70: U\n\nTurn 71: U\n\nTurn 72: S  // stay on row 6\n\nTurn 73: S  // stay\n\nTurn 74: U\n\nTurn 75: U\n\nTurn 76: U\n\nAfter action at turn 76, position at turn 77 is (0,9).\n\nIn the sequence, we need to list until the action that brings us to (0,9), which is turn 76 U.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let's write the relative to t1.\n\nt1=66.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 66: a_{66} = U\n\nTurn 67: a_{67} = U\n\nTurn 68: a_{68} = U\n\nTurn 69: a_{69} = U\n\nTurn 70: a_{70} = U\n\nTurn 71: a_{71} = U\n\nTurn 72: a_{72} = S\n\nTurn 73: a_{73} = S\n\nTurn 74: a_{74} = U\n\nTurn 75: a_{75} = U\n\nTurn 76: a_{76} = U\n\nNow, to confirm the car positions, but I think we already considered the danger times.\n\nFor example, at t=6 relative, which is turn 72, on row 6, which is safe since only dangerous at t=2.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nSo I think this is minimal.\n</think>\nTo reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 0) at turn 66 in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8, the player must navigate around dangerous times on specific rows. The dangerous times for each row, derived from the car states at turn 66, are as follows:\n\n- Row 1: dangerous at turns 78, 79, 80 (relative t=12,13,14)\n- Row 2: dangerous at turns 78, 79, 80 (relative t=12,13,14)\n- Row 3: dangerous at turns 66, 67, 68 (relative t=0,1,2)\n- Row 4: dangerous at turns 66, 67, 68 (relative t=0,1,2)\n- Row 5: dangerous at turns 66, 67, 68 (relative t=0,1,2)\n- Row 6: dangerous only at turn 68 (relative t=2)\n- Row 7: dangerous at turns 72, 73, 74 (relative t=6,7,8)\n- Row 8: dangerous at turns 78, 79, 80 (relative t=12,13,14)\n\nRows y=0 and y=9 have no cars and are always safe.\n\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach (0, 9) is 11, achieved with the following action sequence:\n\n- Move up (U) for the first 6 turns to reach row 6 by turn 72 (relative t=6).\n- Stay (S) on row 6 for turns 72 and 73 (relative t=6 and t=7) to avoid being on row 7 during its dangerous times (turns 72, 73, 74).\n- Move up (U) for the last 3 turns to reach row 9 by turn 77.\n\nThis sequence ensures that the player is never on a dangerous row at a dangerous time:\n\n- At turn 66 (t=0): y=0, safe (no cars).\n- At turn 67 (t=1): y=1, safe (row 1 not dangerous at t=1).\n- At turn 68 (t=2): y=2, safe (row 2 not dangerous at t=2).\n- At turn 69 (t=3): y=3, safe (row 3 dangerous only at t=0,1,2; t=3 safe).\n- At turn 70 (t=4): y=4, safe (row 4 dangerous only at t=0,1,2; t=4 safe).\n- At turn 71 (t=5): y=5, safe (row 5 dangerous only at t=0,1,2; t=5 safe).\n- At turn 72 (t=6): y=6, safe (row 6 dangerous only at t=2; t=6 safe).\n- At turn 73 (t=7): y=6, safe (row 6 safe at t=7).\n- At turn 74 (t=8): y=6, safe (row 6 safe at t=8).\n- At turn 75 (t=9): y=7, safe (row 7 dangerous at t=6,7,8; t=9 safe).\n- At turn 76 (t=10): y=8, safe (row 8 dangerous at t=12,13,14; t=10 safe).\n- At turn 77: position (0,9) reached, safe (no cars).\n\nThe actions are specified for turns 66 to 76, and the position (0,9) is achieved at turn 77.\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 66: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 67: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 68: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 69: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 70: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 71: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 72: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 73: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 74: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 75: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 76: U }",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get the player from (0,0) at turn 72 to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing the y-position by +1, -1, or 0 each turn, and y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nThe cars are on freeways 1 through 8, and each has a head, tail, direction, and speed. Direction is either left or right, which affects how they move. Left-moving cars decrease their position over time, right-moving increase.\n\nCollision happens only if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y, and for that y, there's a car where 0 is in its span at that turn. Importantly, when the player moves to a new y, they are not on that y until the next turn, so they only check for collision on the y they are currently on at the start of the turn.\n\nThe car spans are given at turn t1=72. For future turns, I need to compute the span based on the speed and direction.\n\nLet me list all the cars and their states at t1=72.\n\nFor freeway k=1: one car: head h=-48, tail τ=-59, direction right, speed s=4. Since it's right-moving, the span is [τ, h] = [-59, -48]. Direction right means it moves to the right, so positions increase. At time T, span is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] = [-59 + 4(T-72), -48 + 4(T-72)]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nk=2: same as k=1: head -48, tail -59, right, speed 4. So span at T: [-59 + 4(T-72), -48 + 4(T-72)]\n\nk=3: two cars: first car (48, 37, right, 4). Head 48, tail 37, but direction right, so span should be [tail, head] for right-moving? Let's see the rule.\n\nThe rule says: for right-moving, span(t1) = [τ, h], and at T, [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nIn this case, for first car on k=3: head=48, tail=37, direction right, so at t1, span is [τ, h] = [37,48]\n\nThen at T, [37 + 4(T-72), 48 + 4(T-72)]\n\nSecond car on k=3: (0, -11, right, 4), so span at t1: [τ, h] = [-11, 0]\n\nAt T: [-11 + 4(T-72), 0 + 4(T-72)] = [-11 + 4(T-72), 4(T-72)]\n\nk=4: same as k=3: two cars identical to k=3.\n\nk=5: same as k=3 and k=4.\n\nk=6: one car: (48, 83, left, 36)\n\nDirection left, so for left-moving, span(t1) = [h, τ] = [48,83]? Head and tail, but left-moving, span(t1) = [h, τ], and at T, [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nHere head=48, tail=83, but if it's left-moving, and head is smaller? I think I need to interpret head and tail consistently.\n\nThe rule says: for left-moving, span(t1) = [h, τ], so head is the left end or right end? In the notation, for left-moving, [h, τ] with h and τ such that it moves left.\n\nIn the car state, for k=6: (48, 83, left, 36), so h=48, τ=83, left-moving.\n\nSince left-moving, the head is the leading part? Let's see the movement.\n\nAt t1, span is [h, τ] = [48,83], so from 48 to 83, which is to the right, but left-moving means it decreases position, so at T, span is [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)] = [48 - 36(T-72), 83 - 36(T-72)]\n\nSince it's moving left, positions decrease.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nk=7: three cars: (48, 37, right, 4), (12, 1, right, 4), (-24, -35, right, 4)\n\nFirst car: head=48, tail=37, right, so span [37,48] at t1\n\nSecond car: head=12, tail=1, right, span [1,12] at t1\n\nThird car: head=-24? head is -24, tail=-35, right, span [-35,-24] at t1\n\nk=8: one car: (-48, -59, right, 4), same as k=1 and k=2, span [-59,-48] at t1\n\nNow, the player starts at y=0 at t=72. y=0 is not a freeway, so no cars there, so it's safe. Freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, I assume, no cars.\n\nThe goal is to reach (0,9), which is also safe.\n\nNow, each turn, the player chooses an action, changes y, and then at the new position, checks for collision with cars on that freeway at that turn.\n\nWhen moving, if at turn T, player is on y, and moves to y' at turn T+1, then at turn T, collision is checked only for freeway y, since that's where they are during the turn. At turn T+1, they are on y', so check freeway y'.\n\nThe note says: if you move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you are not on y_{T+1} at turn T, so no collision from cars on y_{T+1} at turn T.\n\nOnly the current freeway matters for collision at each turn.\n\nSince y=0 and y=9 have no cars, they are always safe.\n\nThe player needs to go from y=0 to y=9, passing through y=1 to 8, but must avoid being on a freeway when a car has 0 in its span.\n\ny-position changes only by -1,0,+1 each turn, so to go from 0 to 9, minimum turns are 9 if moving up each time, but may need to wait or detour to avoid cars.\n\nH is the number of turns, from t=72 to t=72+H-1, and at turn t=72+H-1, y=9.\n\nLet me denote the turn relative to t1. Set t=0 at t1=72, so current turn t=0, y=0.\n\nThen we need to find actions from t=0 to t=H-1, such that at t=H-1, y=9.\n\ny_t is position at turn t.\n\nAt t=0, y=0.\n\nAfter action a_t at turn t, y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, with Δy based on a_t.\n\nAnd at each turn t, when y_t is between 1 and 8, we must not have collision, meaning for freeway k=y_t, at turn t, 0 is not in the span of any car on that freeway.\n\nTurn t means the absolute turn is t1 + t.\n\nIn relative terms, at relative turn t, absolute turn is 72 + t.\n\nFor car positions, we use absolute time.\n\nDefine T_abs = 72 + t for relative turn t.\n\nThen for a car on freeway k, at absolute time T_abs, the span can be computed.\n\nCollision at relative turn t if y_t = k for some k=1 to 8, and for that k, at time T_abs=72+t, 0 is in the span of some car on k.\n\nNow, let's list for each freeway k, the condition for 0 to be in a car's span at time t (relative).\n\nFirst, for k=1: one car, right-moving, span at T_abs: [ -59 + 4(T_abs - 72), -48 + 4(T_abs - 72) ]\n\nSet Δt = T_abs - 72, so relative time.\n\nSpan: [ -59 + 4Δt, -48 + 4Δt ]\n\n0 in span if -59 + 4Δt <= 0 <= -48 + 4Δt\n\nSimilarly, for k=2: same as k=1, since identical car.\n\nk=2 has the same car as k=1: (-48,-59,right,4), so same span: [ -59 + 4Δt, -48 + 4Δt ]\n\nk=3: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (48,37,right,4), span at t: [37 + 4Δt, 48 + 4Δt]\n\n0 in span if 37 + 4Δt <= 0 <= 48 + 4Δt, which is impossible since 37+4Δt >0 for Δt >=0, as 37>0, so never 0 in this span.\n\nSecond car: (0,-11,right,4), span at t: [ -11 + 4Δt, 0 + 4Δt ] = [4Δt -11, 4Δt]\n\n0 in span if 4Δt -11 <= 0 <= 4Δt\n\nSince 0 <= 4Δt always for Δt >=0, so only need 4Δt -11 <= 0, so 4Δt <=11, Δt <= 11/4 = 2.75, so for Δt <= 2 since integer? Δt is integer, turns are discrete.\n\nΔt is relative turn, integer.\n\nSo 0 in span if 4Δt -11 <= 0 and 0 <= 4Δt\n\n0 <= 4Δt always for Δt >=0\n\n4Δt -11 <=0 => Δt <= 11/4 = 2.75, so since Δt integer, Δt <= 2.\n\nFor Δt=0,1,2.\n\nAt Δt=0: span [-11,0], so 0 is included? 4*0 -11 = -11, 4*0=0, so [-11,0], 0 is the upper bound.\n\nThe span is [lower, upper], and 0 in it if lower <= 0 <= upper.\n\nAt Δt=0, lower= -11, upper=0, so -11 <=0<=0, yes, 0 is included.\n\nAt Δt=1, lower=4*1-11= -7, upper=4, -7<=0<=4, yes.\n\nΔt=2, lower=8-11= -3, upper=8, -3<=0<=8, yes.\n\nΔt=3, lower=12-11=1, upper=12, 1<=0<=12? 0 <1, not <=, so no.\n\nSimilarly, higher Δt, no.\n\nSo for k=3, second car, collision possible for Δt=0,1,2.\n\nFirst car never collision, as span always positive.\n\nSimilarly for k=4: same as k=3, so collision for Δt=0,1,2 from second car.\n\nk=5: same as k=3 and k=4.\n\nNow k=6: one car (48,83,left,36)\n\nLeft-moving, span at t: [h - s Δt, τ - s Δt] = [48 - 36 Δt, 83 - 36 Δt]\n\n0 in span if 48 - 36 Δt <= 0 <= 83 - 36 Δt\n\nNow, 0 <= 83 - 36 Δt always for small Δt, but 83-36Δt decreases.\n\nAnd 48 - 36 Δt <=0 => 48 <= 36 Δt => Δt >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈1.333, so Δt >= 2 since integer? Δt >= ceil(4/3)=2? Let's see.\n\n48 - 36 Δt <=0 => 36 Δt >=48 => Δt >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈1.333, so since Δt integer, Δt >=2.\n\nAlso, 0 <= 83 - 36 Δt => 36 Δt <=83 => Δt <= 83/36 ≈2.305, so Δt <=2.\n\nThus, only Δt=2: 48-72= -24, 83-72=11, so [-24,11], 0 in it.\n\nΔt=1: 48-36=12, 83-36=47, [12,47], 0 not in.\n\nΔt=0: [48,83], 0 not in.\n\nΔt=2: [48-72,83-72]= [-24,11], -24<=0<=11, yes.\n\nΔt=3: [48-108,83-108]= [-60,-25], 0 not in.\n\nSo only at Δt=2, collision possible for k=6.\n\nNow k=7: three cars.\n\nFirst car: (48,37,right,4), span [37 +4Δt, 48+4Δt], always positive, no collision.\n\nSecond car: (12,1,right,4), span [1+4Δt, 12+4Δt], always positive, no collision? 1+4Δt >=1>0, so 0 not in.\n\nThird car: (-24,-35,right,4)? Head -24, tail -35, right, so span [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] = [-35 +4Δt, -24 +4Δt]\n\n0 in span if -35 +4Δt <=0 <= -24 +4Δt\n\nFirst, 0 <= -24 +4Δt => 4Δt >=24 => Δt >=6\n\nSecond, -35 +4Δt <=0 => 4Δt <=35 => Δt <= 35/4=8.75, so Δt <=8\n\nThus for Δt=6 to 8 inclusive.\n\nNow k=8: one car, same as k=1 and k=2: (-48,-59,right,4), span [-59+4Δt, -48+4Δt]\n\n0 in span if -59+4Δt <=0 <= -48+4Δt\n\n0 <= -48+4Δt => 4Δt >=48 => Δt >=12\n\n-59+4Δt <=0 => 4Δt <=59 => Δt <=59/4=14.75, so Δt <=14\n\nThus for Δt=12 to 14.\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway, when collision occurs (0 in some car span) at relative time Δt:\n\nk=1: Δt <=2? From earlier: for k=1, span [-59+4Δt, -48+4Δt], 0 in if -59+4Δt <=0 <= -48+4Δt\n\n0 <= -48+4Δt => Δt >=12, same as k=8? k=1 has the same car as k=8? No, k=1,2,8 all have identical cars? k=1: (-48,-59,right,4), k=2 same, k=8 same. But k=3,4,5 have different.\n\nk=1: car (-48,-59,right,4), so span [-59+4Δt, -48+4Δt]\n\n0 in if -59+4Δt <=0 <= -48+4Δt\n\nLower bound: -59+4Δt <=0 => 4Δt <=59 => Δt <=14.75, Δt<=14\n\nUpper bound: 0 <= -48+4Δt => 4Δt >=48 => Δt >=12\n\nSo Δt=12,13,14\n\nSimilarly for k=2: same, Δt=12,13,14\n\nk=2 has same car, so same collision times.\n\nk=3: only second car causes collision for Δt=0,1,2\n\nSimilarly k=4 and k=5 same.\n\nk=6: only Δt=2\n\nk=7: third car causes collision for Δt=6,7,8\n\nk=8: Δt=12,13,14 same as k=1.\n\nNow, the player starts at y=0, t=0 (relative).\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nEach action changes y by at most 1, so minimum H=9 if we go up every turn.\n\nBut we need to avoid being on a freeway when collision occurs.\n\nAt t=0, y=0, which is safe, no freeway.\n\nAfter action a_0, at t=1, y_1 = y_0 + Δy_0, and at turn t=1, we are on y_1, and check collision if y_1 between 1 and 8.\n\nSimilarly for each turn.\n\nThe sequence of positions: at turn t, position y_t.\n\nFor t from 0 to H-1.\n\nAt t=0, y_0=0, safe.\n\nAfter a_0, y_1 = y_0 + Δy_0\n\nAt turn t=1, we are on y_1, must be safe if y_1 in 1-8.\n\nThen similarly, at turn t, we are on y_t, must be safe.\n\nAnd at turn H-1, y_{H-1}=9.\n\nWe need to choose actions to reach y=9 in min turns.\n\nSince we start at 0 and end at 9, and must go through each y, but we can stay or go down to avoid, but going down might not help since we need to go up eventually.\n\nThe dangerous times are when we are on a freeway at a time when collision occurs.\n\nList for each freeway and time when it is dangerous.\n\nFreeway k, relative time Δt when collision possible:\n\nk=1: Δt=12,13,14\n\nk=2: same, Δt=12,13,14\n\nk=3: Δt=0,1,2 (from second car)\n\nk=4: same as k=3, Δt=0,1,2\n\nk=5: same, Δt=0,1,2\n\nk=6: Δt=2 only\n\nk=7: Δt=6,7,8\n\nk=8: Δt=12,13,14\n\nNow, since the player moves step by step, we need to plan a path where when on a freeway k at time t, t is not in the dangerous set for k.\n\nt here is relative time.\n\ny_t is the position at time t.\n\nWe need y_t for t=0 to H-1, with y_0=0, y_{H-1}=9.\n\nFor each t, if y_t in {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}, then t must not be in the collision set for k=y_t.\n\nOtherwise, if y_t=0 or 9, safe.\n\nSince we want min H, we should go up as much as possible, but avoid dangerous positions.\n\nStart at t=0, y=0.\n\nAfter first action, at t=1, y_1 could be 0,1, or if down, but y=0 min, so a_0 can be S or U, not D, since y=0, can't go down.\n\nSimilarly, at y=9, can't go up.\n\nBut we start at y=0.\n\nSo possible actions: S or U at t=0.\n\nIf S, y_1=0, still safe.\n\nIf U, y_1=1.\n\nNow, at t=1, if y_1=1, then k=1, and for k=1, collision at t=12,13,14, but t=1 is not in that, so safe? t=1 relative.\n\nFor k=1, dangerous at t=12,13,14, so at t=1, it is safe to be on k=1.\n\nSimilarly, for other times.\n\nBut we need to check for each position and time.\n\nNow, the immediate danger is for k=3,4,5 at t=0,1,2.\n\nt=0: but at t=0, we are at y=0, not on freeway, so no issue.\n\nAt t=1, if we are on y=1, which is k=1, safe at t=1.\n\nBut if we go to y=3,4,5 at t=1, that might be dangerous.\n\ny=3,4,5 are dangerous at t=0,1,2.\n\nt=1 is within 0,1,2? t=0,1,2 are times.\n\nRelative time t.\n\nAt time t, position y_t.\n\nFor example, if at time t=1, y_t=3, then k=3, and for k=3, dangerous at t=0,1,2, so yes, at t=1, on k=3 is dangerous.\n\nSimilarly for k=4 and k=5.\n\nk=6 dangerous only at t=2.\n\nk=7 at t=6,7,8.\n\netc.\n\nTo go from y=0 to y=9, min steps: if we go up every turn, we reach y=9 at t=9? Let's see.\n\nStart t=0, y=0\n\nAfter a_0=U, at t=1, y=1\n\na_1=U, t=2, y=2\n\na_2=U, t=3, y=3\n\n...\n\nUp to a_8=U, t=9, y=9.\n\nBut at which turns are we on which y.\n\nAt turn t, y_t.\n\nt=0: y=0, safe\n\nt=1: y=1, k=1, which is safe since dangerous only at t=12-14\n\nt=2: y=2, k=2, dangerous at t=12-14, t=2 safe\n\nt=3: y=3, k=3, dangerous at t=0,1,2. t=3>2, so safe? t=3 not in {0,1,2}, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, t=4: y=4, k=4, dangerous t=0,1,2, t=4 safe\n\nt=5: y=5, k=5, dangerous t=0,1,2, t=5 safe\n\nt=6: y=6, k=6, dangerous only at t=2, t=6 safe\n\nt=7: y=7, k=7, dangerous at t=6,7,8. t=7 is dangerous!\n\nAt t=7, y=7, k=7, collision at t=6,7,8, so unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, t=8: y=8, k=8, dangerous at t=12,13,14, t=8 safe? k=8 dangerous at t=12-14, t=8 not, so safe.\n\nBut at t=7, y=7, unsafe.\n\nIn the direct path, at t=7, y=7, we have collision because k=7 has car at t=6,7,8.\n\nSimilarly, t=6: y=6, k=6, dangerous at t=2, t=6 safe.\n\nt=7: y=7, unsafe.\n\nt=8: y=8, safe.\n\nt=9: y=9, safe.\n\nSo problem at t=7.\n\nWe need to avoid being on y=7 at t=6,7, or 8.\n\nIn particular, for t=7, we cannot be on y=7.\n\nNow, since we are moving up, at t=7 we are at y=7, which is bad.\n\nWe need to either not be at y=7 at t=7, or be there at a different time.\n\nBut the dangerous times are fixed for each freeway.\n\nWe can delay or hurry, or move down to avoid.\n\nFor example, if we stay at some point to let time pass.\n\nMin H might be more than 9.\n\nFirst, let's see the constraints for each freeway.\n\nFreeway k=7 is dangerous at t=6,7,8.\n\nSo we must not be on y=7 at t=6,7,8.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways have constraints, but for min path, we might avoid the issue.\n\nk=3,4,5 dangerous at t=0,1,2, but since we start from y=0, at t=0 we are not on them, and by t=3 we can be on them safely.\n\nIn direct path, we are on y=3 at t=3, which is after t=2, safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nk=6 dangerous at t=2, but in direct path, at t=2 we are on y=2, not y=6, so safe.\n\nOnly issue is y=7 at t=6,7,8.\n\nNow, we need to be at y=9 at some turn.\n\nTo avoid being on y=7 at t=6,7,8.\n\nThe times t=6,7,8 are relative to start.\n\nWe can arrive at y=7 before t=6 or after t=8.\n\nFor example, if we reach y=7 at t=5 or earlier, or at t=9 or later.\n\nBut since we start from y=0 at t=0, and move step by step.\n\nSimilarly, for other positions.\n\nNow, to minimize H, we should go as fast as possible, but with detour or wait.\n\nSince y=7 must be avoided at t=6,7,8, we can either:\n\n- Be on y=7 before t=6, i.e., at t<=5\n\n- Or after t=8, at t>=9\n\nNow, in the direct path, we are at y=7 at t=7.\n\nWe need to adjust.\n\nOption 1: reach y=7 earlier, by moving faster.\n\nBut we start at y=0, min time to y=7 is 7 turns: at t=7, y=7, but that's bad.\n\nTo reach y=7 at t=6, for example.\n\nFrom y=0 at t=0, after 6 actions, y_6.\n\nEach action can be U or S, D would be worse.\n\nTo maximize y, always U or S.\n\nTo reach high y fast, always U.\n\nBut with U every time, at t=6, y=6, not 7.\n\ny_0=0\n\nAfter a_0=U, t=1, y=1\n\na_1=U, t=2, y=2\n\n...\n\na_5=U, t=6, y=6\n\na_6=U, t=7, y=7\n\nSo at t=6, y=6, not 7.\n\nTo be at y=7 at t=6, we need to have increased y by 7 in 6 steps, which means one less up or something.\n\nFrom t=0 to t=6, after 6 actions, y_6.\n\ny_6 = y_0 + sum of Δy from t=0 to t=5 actions? Let's clarify.\n\nAt turn t, after actions up to t-1, but position at start of turn.\n\nAt relative time t, position y_t.\n\nAfter action a_t, y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\n\ny_0 = 0\n\nAfter a_0, y_1 = y_0 + Δy_0\n\n...\n\nAfter a_{t-1}, y_t = y_{t-1} + Δy_{t-1}\n\nStandard: y_t is position at turn t.\n\nTo have y_t = some value.\n\nFor example, y_6 = position at turn 6.\n\ny_6 = y_0 + sum_{i=0}^{5} Δy_i\n\nSince y_0=0, y_6 = sum_{i=0}^{5} Δy_i\n\nEach Δy_i = -1,0,1.\n\ny_6 <= 6 if all U.\n\nTo have y_6 =7, impossible since max 6.\n\ny_t <= t for all t.\n\nSimilarly, min y_t >= -t, but y>=0.\n\nSo at t=6, y_6 <=6, cannot be 7.\n\nSimilarly, at t=5, y_5 <=5, etc.\n\nSo earliest we can be at y=7 is t=7, with all U.\n\nBut at t=7, if y=7, and t=7 is dangerous for k=7.\n\nWe can be at y=7 later, but that increases H.\n\nFor example, at t=9, y=7, but then we need to go to y=9, so later.\n\nBut we want min H.\n\nAnother option: skip y=7 entirely? But we have to go from y=6 to y=8 or something, but y changes by at most 1, so we must pass through y=7.\n\ny must change sequentially, so we must be at y=7 at some point.\n\nCannot skip.\n\nWe must visit y=7 at some turn t where t not in {6,7,8}, so t<=5 or t>=9.\n\nBut t<=5: at t=5, y_5 <=5, cannot be 7.\n\nt=4, y<=4, etc.\n\nSo impossible to be at y=7 at t<=5.\n\nSimilarly, at t=0, y=0.\n\nSo only possibility is to be at y=7 at t>=9.\n\nt=9 or later.\n\nAt t=9, we can be at y=7, but we need to reach y=9.\n\nNow, from start, to delay arriving at y=7.\n\nFor example, stay at lower y for some time.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9.\n\nMin H: if we go directly, we can be at y=9 at t=9, but stuck at t=7 with y=7.\n\nSo we need to spend extra turns somewhere.\n\nFor example, stay at a safe position during dangerous times.\n\nSpecifically, for y=7, dangerous at t=6,7,8.\n\nWe need to not be on y=7 during those times.\n\nSo we should be on y=7 before t=6 or after t=8.\n\nBut before t=6 impossible, so after t=8, at t>=9.\n\nNow, at t=9, we can be at y=7, for example.\n\nThen from there go to y=9.\n\nBut let's see the path.\n\nFirst, from t=0 to some point.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at some T.\n\nMin T such that we can avoid the collisions.\n\nSince we must avoid y=7 at t=6,7,8, and we can be there at t=9.\n\nAt t=9, y=7 is safe? t=9, for k=7, dangerous at t=6,7,8, t=9>8, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, we can be on y=7 at t=9.\n\nThen from t=9, go to y=8 and y=9.\n\nBut at t=9, y=9, or later.\n\nNow, we also have other constraints, but let's see if we can reach y=7 at t=9.\n\nTo reach y=7 at t=9, that means we spent 9 turns to go from y=0 to y=7, which is inefficient, since we can go in 7 turns.\n\nBut we have extra time.\n\nSpecifically, we need to have y_9 =7, for example.\n\nThen y_10=8, y_11=9, so H=12 turns? H is the number of turns from t=0 to H-1.\n\nAt turn t=0 to t=H-1, position y_t.\n\ny_{H-1} =9.\n\nIf we reach y=9 at t=H-1.\n\nIf we go to y=7 at t=9, then y_10=8, y_11=9, so at t=11, y=9, so H-1=11, H=12.\n\nBut perhaps we can be faster.\n\nSince k=7 is dangerous at t=6,7,8, we can be on other y at that time.\n\nFor example, at t=6,7,8, we can be on y=6 or y=8, etc., as long as not 7.\n\nBut we need to be progressing.\n\nAnother idea: at t=6, instead of going to y=7, stay at y=6 or go down, but going down might not help.\n\nLet's list the dangerous times for each y.\n\nFor y=1: dangerous only at t=12,13,14\n\ny=2: same as y=1, since k=2 same car, dangerous t=12,13,14\n\ny=3: dangerous t=0,1,2\n\ny=4: dangerous t=0,1,2\n\ny=5: dangerous t=0,1,2\n\ny=6: dangerous only at t=2\n\ny=7: dangerous t=6,7,8\n\ny=8: dangerous t=12,13,14\n\nNow, we start at t=0, y=0.\n\nAt t=0, we can do S or U.\n\nIf U, at t=1, y=1.\n\nIf S, at t=1, y=0.\n\nNow, y=1 is safe at t=1.\n\nSimilarly, we need to pass y=3,4,5 when not dangerous.\n\ny=3,4,5 dangerous only at t=0,1,2.\n\nSince t=0 we are at y=0, not on them.\n\nAt t=1, if we are on y=1, safe.\n\nTo be on y=3, we need at least t=3, since from y=0 to y=3 min 3 turns: t=0 y=0, t=1 y=1, t=2 y=2, t=3 y=3.\n\nAt t=3, y=3, which is after t=2, so safe, since dangerous only up to t=2.\n\nSimilarly for y=4 and y=5.\n\ny=6 dangerous at t=2, but at t=2, if we are on y=2, not y=6, so safe as long as not on y=6 at t=2.\n\ny=6 at t=2 dangerous, but we can be on y=6 at other times.\n\nIn direct path, at t=6, y=6, which is safe, since dangerous only at t=2.\n\nThen at t=7, y=7, dangerous.\n\nTo avoid y=7 at t=7, we can, at t=6, instead of going up to y=7, stay at y=6 or go down.\n\nBut going down might delay.\n\nFor example, at t=6, y=6, we can choose a_6 = S, so at t=7, y=6 still, not y=7.\n\nThen at t=7, we are on y=6, which is k=6, dangerous only at t=2, t=7 safe.\n\nThen at t=7, we can go up to y=7 or stay.\n\nBut y=7 at t=7 is dangerous, so we cannot go up yet.\n\nWe can stay at y=6 or go down, but going down not useful.\n\nSo stay at y=6 at t=7.\n\nThen at t=7, y=6, safe.\n\nThen at t=8, we can go to y=7 or stay.\n\nt=8, if we go to y=7, but t=8 is dangerous for y=7, since k=7 dangerous t=6,7,8.\n\nSo at t=8, y=7 unsafe.\n\nIf we stay at y=6, at t=8, y=6, safe.\n\nThen at t=9, now t=9>8, so y=7 safe, we can go to y=7.\n\nThen proceed to y=8 and y=9.\n\nLet's see the sequence.\n\nt=0: y=0, safe. Action a_0: must be U to go up. If S, we stay, but delay.\n\nTo min time, go U.\n\na_0 = U, so y_1 =1\n\nt=1: y=1, k=1, safe (dangerous only t=12-14)\n\na_1 = U, y_2 =2\n\nt=2: y=2, k=2, safe\n\na_2 = U, y_3 =3\n\nt=3: y=3, k=3, dangerous at t=0,1,2, t=3 safe\n\na_3 = U, y_4 =4\n\nt=4: y=4, k=4, dangerous t=0,1,2, t=4 safe\n\na_4 = U, y_5 =5\n\nt=5: y=5, k=5, dangerous t=0,1,2, t=5 safe\n\na_5 = U, y_6 =6\n\nt=6: y=6, k=6, dangerous only t=2, t=6 safe\n\nNow, at t=6, we want to avoid going to y=7 because at t=7 y=7 dangerous.\n\nSo instead of U, we do S or D.\n\nD to y=5, but that might not help, so better S.\n\na_6 = S, so y_7 = y_6 + 0 = 6 (since Δy=0 for S)\n\ny_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\n\nAfter a_6 at t=6, y_{7} = y_6 + Δy_6\n\nIf a_6=S, Δy_6=0, so y_7=6\n\nt=7: y=6, k=6, safe (t=7 not 2)\n\nNow, we cannot go to y=7 because at t=7, if we go to y=7, at turn t=7, we are on y=7? No.\n\nAt turn t=7, position y_7=6.\n\nWe are on y=6, safe.\n\nNow, action a_7: if we do U, y_8 = y_7 +1 =7\n\nBut at turn t=8, position y_8=7, and we need to check collision at t=8 for y=7.\n\nt=8, y=7, k=7, dangerous at t=6,7,8, so yes, unsafe.\n\nIf we do S at t=7, y_8 = y_7 +0 =6\n\nThen at t=8, y=6, safe.\n\nThen at t=8, we can do U, y_9 = y_8 +1 =7\n\nNow t=9, position y_9=7.\n\nt=9, for k=7, dangerous t=6,7,8, t=9>8, so safe.\n\nThen we can go up.\n\na_8 = U, y_10 = y_9 +1 =8\n\nt=10: y=8, k=8, dangerous at t=12,13,14, t=10<12, safe\n\na_9 = U, y_11 =9\n\nt=11: y=9, safe.\n\nSo we reach y=9 at t=11.\n\nH-1=11, so H=12.\n\nBut we started from t=0, actions from t=0 to t=11? Let's see the turns.\n\nRelative turns: from t=0 to t=11, that's 12 turns? t=0 to t=11 inclusive is 12 steps, but the position is defined at each turn.\n\ny_t at t=0 to t=11.\n\nAt t=0: y=0\n\nt=1: y=1\n\n...\n\nt=6: y=6\n\nt=7: y=6 (after S at t=6)\n\nt=8: y=6 (after S at t=7? Not yet)\n\nSequence:\n\nt=0: y=0, action a_0=U\n\nt=1: y=1, action a_1=U\n\nt=2: y=2, action a_2=U\n\nt=3: y=3, action a_3=U\n\nt=4: y=4, action a_4=U\n\nt=5: y=5, action a_5=U\n\nt=6: y=6, action a_6=S (stay)\n\nThen y_7 = y_6 + 0 =6 (since a_6=S at t=6)\n\nt=7: y=6, action a_7=S (stay again? Or what)\n\nAt t=7, y=6, we need to choose action.\n\nIf we do S, then y_8 = y_7 +0 =6\n\nThen at t=8, y=6, then action a_8=U, y_9=7\n\nt=9: y=7, safe\n\nThen a_9=U, y_10=8\n\nt=10: y=8, safe\n\na_10=U, y_11=9\n\nt=11: y=9, done.\n\nBut at t=8, we are at y=6, and we go to y=7 at t=9.\n\nIn the above, we stayed at y=6 for two extra turns: t=7 and t=8 we are still at y=6? No.\n\nt=6: y=6, after a_6=S, y_7=6\n\nt=7: y=6, now if we do a_7=S, then y_8=6\n\nt=8: y=6, then a_8=U, y_9=7\n\nBut at t=8, we are at y=6, which is safe.\n\nThen at t=9, y=7, safe.\n\nBut we could at t=7, instead of staying, go up? But if we go up at t=7, y_8=7, then at t=8, y=7, which is dangerous, since t=8 in {6,7,8}.\n\nSo we cannot.\n\nThus, we must stay at y=6 until t=8 or later.\n\nAt t=7, we can do a_7=S, so y_8=6\n\nThen at t=8, y=6, safe.\n\nThen a_8=U, so y_9=7\n\nt=9: y=7, safe\n\na_9=U, y_10=8\n\nt=10: y=8, safe\n\na_10=U, y_11=9\n\nt=11: y=9\n\nSo actions from t=0 to t=10, 11 actions, to reach y_{11}=9.\n\nt=0 to t=10, that's 11 turns? Turns: t=0,1,2,...,10, that's 11 steps.\n\nPosition at turn t: after H turns, we have position at turn H.\n\ny_0, y_1, ..., y_H\n\nAt turn 0, y=0\n\nAfter H actions, we have y_H.\n\nWe want y_H =9 for some H.\n\nIn this case, with H=11, y_{11}=9.\n\nt from 0 to 11, but turn t=11 has y=9.\n\nNumber of actions: from a_0 to a_{10}, that's 11 actions, to reach after a_{10}, y_{11}=9.\n\nSince we start at turn t=72, absolute.\n\nBut in relative, min H=11.\n\nBut H is the number of turns, I think.\n\nThe question: minimal number of turns H and sequence.\n\nH is such that we reach at turn t_1 + H -1 =72 + H -1.\n\nAnd y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nIn relative, at relative turn T, with T=H-1, y_T=9.\n\nIn my notation, at turn t (relative), y_t.\n\nWe need y_T =9 for some T.\n\nWith above, T=11.\n\nActions from t=0 to t=10.\n\nNow, but we have k=8 dangerous at t=12,13,14, but at t=10, y=8, t=10<12, safe.\n\nAnd we reach y=9 at t=11, before t=12.\n\nNow, but in the sequence, we stayed at y=6 for t=6, t=7, and t=8? t=6: y=6, t=7:y=6, t=8:y=6? In above, t=6:y=6, t=7:y=6 (after S at t=6), t=8:y=6 (after S at t=7), then t=9:y=7.\n\nt=8 y=6, which is fine.\n\nBut we can reduce the waiting.\n\nAt t=6: y=6, we do S, so y_7=6\n\nt=7: y=6, now instead of S, we can do something else, but if we do U, y_8=7, which at t=8, y=7 dangerous.\n\nIf we do D, y_8=5, then we go down, worse.\n\nSo must do S at t=7 as well.\n\nBut at t=7, we do S, y_8=6\n\nThen at t=8, y=6, we do U, y_9=7\n\nBut at t=8, we are on y=6, safe.\n\nNow, t=9: y=7, safe.\n\nBut we spent three turns at y=6? t=6,7,8 all at y=6? No.\n\nt=6: position y=6\n\nAfter a_6=S, y_7=6\n\nt=7: position y=6\n\nAfter a_7=S, y_8=6\n\nt=8: position y=6\n\nAfter a_8=U, y_9=7\n\nt=9: position y=7\n\nThen a_9=U, y_10=8\n\nt=10: y=8\n\na_10=U, y_11=9\n\nt=11: y=9\n\nSo from t=6 to t=8, we are at y=6 for three turns: t=6,7,8.\n\nBut at t=8, we are still at y=6, then go to y=7 at t=9.\n\nWe only need to avoid y=7 at t=6,7,8.\n\nAt t=6, we are at y=6, safe.\n\nt=7, at y=6, safe.\n\nt=8, we could be at y=8 or something, but not necessary.\n\nSince at t=8, if we are at y=6, it is safe, and we go to y=7 at t=9.\n\nBut we can be at y=7 earlier if possible, but not at t=7 or 8.\n\nt=9 is fine.\n\nIn this sequence, we have y=6 from t=6 to t=8, three turns.\n\nBut at t=5, we are at y=5.\n\nt=5: y=5\n\nAfter a_5=U, y_6=6\n\nt=6: y=6\n\nThen we stay with a_6=S, y_7=6\n\na_7=S, y_8=6\n\na_8=U, y_9=7\n\n...\n\nWe can reduce the waiting by only staying one extra turn.\n\nFor example, at t=6, y=6, instead of staying, we can go down? But that might not help.\n\nOr, we can go to y=7 later, but we need to leave y=6 before t=9? No.\n\nAnother point: at t=2, y=2, which is safe, but y=6 is dangerous at t=2, but we are not on it.\n\nBut we can use that.\n\nFor example, if we can be at y=6 at t=2, but at t=2, we are at y=2, since we start from 0.\n\nTo be at y=6 at t=2, impossible, y<=2.\n\nSo no.\n\nPerhaps we can reach y=7 at t=9 with less delay.\n\nIn the direct path, we are at y=7 at t=7, which is bad.\n\nWe need to slow down before reaching y=7.\n\nFor example, at some earlier point, stay to waste time.\n\nSay, at t=3, y=3, instead of going up, stay for one turn.\n\nThen proceed.\n\nLet's try.\n\nt=0: y=0, a_0=U, y_1=1\n\nt=1: y=1, a_1=U, y_2=2\n\nt=2: y=2, a_2=U, y_3=3\n\nt=3: y=3, now instead of U, we do S, a_3=S, so y_4=3 (still at y=3)\n\nt=4: y=3, now a_4=U, y_5=4\n\nt=5: y=4, a_5=U, y_6=5? y_5=4 after a_5=U? Let's list:\n\nAfter a_3=S at t=3, y_4=3\n\nt=4: position y=3, action a_4=U, so y_5 = y_4 +1 =4\n\nt=5: y=4, action a_5=U, y_6=5\n\nt=6: y=5, action a_6=U, y_7=6\n\nt=7: y=6, action a_7=U? If U, y_8=7, then at t=8, y=7, dangerous.\n\nProblem at t=8.\n\ny_7=6 at t=7.\n\nIf a_7=U, y_8=7, t=8 y=7 dangerous.\n\nIf a_7=S, y_8=6, t=8 y=6 safe.\n\nThen a_8=U, y_9=7, t=9 y=7 safe.\n\nThen a_9=U, y_10=8, t=10 y=8\n\na_10=U, y_11=9, t=11 y=9\n\nSame as before, 11 turns to reach y=9 at t=11.\n\nBut in this sequence, we stayed at y=3 for one turn, so we are behind.\n\nt=0:0, t=1:1, t=2:2, t=3:3, t=4:3 (after stay), t=5:4, t=6:5, t=7:6, t=8:6 (after S), t=9:7, t=10:8, t=11:9.\n\ny_11=9.\n\nCompared to first sequence without early stay: t=0:0,t=1:1,t=2:2,t=3:3,t=4:4,t=5:5,t=6:6,t=7:6 (S),t=8:6 (S),t=9:7,t=10:8,t=11:9.\n\nIn first sequence, we had t=7 and t=8 both at y=6, but in this with early stay, we have t=4 at y=3 and t=8 at y=6, but still 11 turns.\n\nIn both cases, we reach y=9 at t=11.\n\nBut in the first sequence without early stay, we were at t=4:y=4, t=5:y=5, t=6:y=6, then stayed at y=6 for t=7 and t=8?

No.\n\ny_t at turn t.\n\nAfter actions.\n\nt=0: position y=0, action a_0=U, so after action, y=1 at turn t=1? Let's list positions and actions clearly.\n\nAt turn t (relative), position y_t, then action a_t, then position at next turn y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nBut for collision, at each turn t, we are on position y_t, and check if on freeway.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nTurn t=0 (relative): position y=0, action a_0 = U (so y_{1} = 0 +1 =1)\n\nTurn t=1: position y=1, action a_1 = U (y_2=2)\n\nTurn t=2: position y=2, action a_2 = U (y_3=3)\n\nTurn t=3: position y=3, action a_3 = U (y_4=4)\n\nTurn t=4: position y=4, action a_4 = U (y_5=5)\n\nTurn t=5: position y=5, action a_5 = U (y_6=6)\n\nTurn t=6: position y=6, action a_6 = S (y_7=6)\n\nTurn t=7: position y=6, action a_7 = S (y_8=6)\n\nTurn t=8: position y=6, action a_8 = U (y_9=7)\n\nTurn t=9: position y=7, action a_9 = U (y_{10}=8)\n\nTurn t=10: position y=8, action a_{10} = U (y_{11}=9)\n\nThen at turn t=11, position y=9, which is the goal.\n\nWe need to reach at turn H-1, so here t=11 relative, which is absolute turn 72 + 11 = 83.\n\nNumber of actions: from a_0 to a_{10}, 11 actions.\n\nH is the number of turns from t1, so from turn 72 to turn 72+H-1.\n\nAt turn 72 + (H-1) = 83, so H-1=11, H=12.\n\nSince we start at turn 72, and go to turn 83, that's 12 turns: 72 to 83 inclusive is 12 turns.\n\nTurns: 72,73,...,83, that's 12 turns.\n\nIn the sequence, actions at turn 72 to turn 82? Let's see.\n\nAbsolute turn: let τ = t1 + t, so τ from 72 to 72 + T.\n\nAt absolute turn τ, position, action.\n\nIn relative, t from 0 to 10 for actions, but position at turn τ.\n\nStart: at absolute turn 72, relative t=0, position (0,0)\n\nAfter action a_{t1} at turn 72, which is a_{72}, then position at turn 73 is y=1, etc.\n\nIn the answer, it should be actions starting from turn t1.\n\nNow, for the sequence:\n\nAt turn 72 (relative t=0): action a_{72} = U\n\nThen position at turn 73: (0,1)\n\nAt turn 73 (t=1): action a_{73} = U\n\nTurn 74: position (0,2), action a_{74} = U\n\nTurn 75: (0,3), action a_{75} = U\n\nTurn 76: (0,4), action a_{76} = U\n\nTurn 77: (0,5), action a_{77} = U\n\nTurn 78: (0,6), action a_{78} = S\n\nTurn 79: position (0,6), action a_{79} = S\n\nTurn 80: position (0,6), action a_{80} = U\n\nTurn 81: position (0,7), action a_{81} = U\n\nTurn 82: position (0,8), action a_{82} = U\n\nThen at turn 83: position (0,9), which is the goal.\n\nActions from turn 72 to 82, that's 11 actions, and we reach at turn 83.\n\nH-1=11, H=12.\n\nIn the sequence, we have two stays at y=6.\n\nBut in the action list, for turn 78 and 79, we have S.\n\nNow, but we need to output the sequence.\n\nIn the car state, for k=7, we have cars, but in this path, we are not on k=7 during dangerous times.\n\nAt turn 79 absolute, relative t=7? Absolute turn 79, relative t=79-72=7.\n\nAt that time, we are on y=6, not 7.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nIs there a way with only one extra turn?\n\nSuppose we stay only once.\n\nFor example, at t=6, y=6, we do S, so at t=7, y=6.\n\nThen at t=7, we do U, so at t=8, y=7.\n\nBut at t=8, y=7, which is dangerous, not allowed.\n\nIf we do D at some point, but that would require more steps.\n\nFor example, at t=5, y=5, we do D, to y=4 at t=6, then go up, but slower.\n\nNot better.\n\nSo min H=12 turns.\n\nBut in the sequence, we can have the stay at a different y.\n\nFor example, stay at y=5 for one turn instead.\n\nBut still, we need to avoid y=7 at t=7.\n\nSuppose at t=4, y=4, we do S, so t=5, y=4.\n\nThen t=5: y=4, U to y=5 at t=6.\n\nt=6: y=5, U to y=6 at t=7.\n\nt=7: y=6, now if U, y_8=7, t=8 y=7 dangerous.\n\nSo must S at t=7, y_8=6\n\nt=8: y=6, U to y=7 at t=9\n\nt=9: y=7, U to y=8 at t=10\n\nt=10: y=8, U to y=9 at t=11\n\nSame, t=11 y=9.\n\nAnd we stayed at y=4 and y=6, but still 11 turns to reach.\n\nNo saving.\n\nThus, minimal is 12 turns, with sequence as above.\n\nNow, in the answer, we need to output the actions.\n\nAlso, for the car on k=6, at t=2, but we are not on it, fine.\n\nSimilarly, no other issues.\n\nNow, the sequence of actions:\n\nTurn 72: U\n\nTurn 73: U\n\nTurn 74: U\n\nTurn 75: U\n\nTurn 76: U\n\nTurn 77: U\n\nTurn 78: S\n\nTurn 79: S\n\nTurn 80: U\n\nTurn 81: U\n\nTurn 82: U\n\nThen at turn 83, position (0,9).\n\nIn the action list, we have up to turn 82, 11 actions.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let me confirm the collision points.\n\nFor example, at turn 78 absolute, relative t=6, position y=6, freeway k=6.\n\nAt t=6 relative, for k=6, dangerous only at t=2, which is earlier, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, turn 79, t=7, y=6, same.\n\nTurn 80, t=8, y=6, action U, to y=7 at next turn.\n\nTurn 81, t=9, y=7, freeway k=7.\n\nAt t=9 relative, for k=7, dangerous at t=6,7,8, t=9>8, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, turn 82, t=10, y=8, k=8, dangerous at t=12,13,14, t=10<12, safe.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nAll good.\n\nSo minimal H=12.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 72: U\n\nTurn 73: U\n\nTurn 74: U\n\nTurn 75: U\n\nTurn 76: U\n\nTurn 77: U\n\nTurn 78: S\n\nTurn 79: S\n\nTurn 80: U\n\nTurn 81: U\n\nTurn 82: U\n\nIn the sequence, turn 77: action U, to y=6 at turn 78? Let's list absolute.\n\nTurn 72: action U, position after: (0,1) at turn 73\n\nBetter to list actions per turn.\n\nThe answer format is:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1}\n\n...\n\nUp to the action before reaching.\n\nIn this case, from turn 72 to turn 82.\n\nActions: a_72 to a_82.\n\nWith a_72=U, a_73=U, ..., a_77=U, a_78=S, a_79=S, a_80=U, a_81=U, a_82=U.\n\nThen after a_82, position at turn 83 is (0,9).\n\nH=12, since from turn 72 to 83, 12 turns.\n\nNow, in the box.\n\nBut the player is at (0,0) at turn 72, and we reach (0,9) at turn 83.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the sequence.\n</think>\nTo reach the position (0, 9) from (0, 0) at turn 72 in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8, the player must follow a sequence of actions that accounts for the dangerous times on each freeway. The dangerous times for each freeway (relative to turn 72) are:\n\n- Freeway y=1: dangerous at turns 84, 85, 86 (relative t=12,13,14)\n- Freeway y=2: dangerous at turns 84, 85, 86 (relative t=12,13,14)\n- Freeway y=3: dangerous at turns 72, 73, 74 (relative t=0,1,2)\n- Freeway y=4: dangerous at turns 72, 73, 74 (relative t=0,1,2)\n- Freeway y=5: dangerous at turns 72, 73, 74 (relative t=0,1,2)\n- Freeway y=6: dangerous at turn 74 (relative t=2)\n- Freeway y=7: dangerous at turns 78, 79, 80 (relative t=6,7,8)\n- Freeway y=8: dangerous at turns 84, 85, 86 (relative t=12,13,14)\n\nThe key constraint is that freeway y=7 is dangerous at turns 78, 79, and 80 (absolute turns). The player cannot be on y=7 during these turns. Since the player must pass through y=7 to reach y=9, and the earliest possible time to be on y=7 safely is turn 81 (relative t=9), the minimal path requires waiting at y=6 for two turns (turns 78 and 79) to avoid the dangerous period for y=7.\n\nThe sequence of actions that achieves this in 12 turns (reaching (0,9) at turn 83) is as follows:\n\n- At turn 72, the player is at (0,0). Action U moves to (0,1) at turn 73.\n- At turn 73, the player is at (0,1). Action U moves to (0,2) at turn 74.\n- At turn 74, the player is at (0,2). Action U moves to (0,3) at turn 75.\n- At turn 75, the player is at (0,3). Action U moves to (0,4) at turn 76.\n- At turn 76, the player is at (0,4). Action U moves to (0,5) at turn 77.\n- At turn 77, the player is at (0,5). Action U moves to (0,6) at turn 78.\n- At turn 78, the player is at (0,6). Action S stays at (0,6) for turn 79 (avoiding moving to y=7 during dangerous turn 78).\n- At turn 79, the player is at (0,6). Action S stays at (0,6) for turn 80 (avoiding moving to y=7 during dangerous turn 79).\n- At turn 80, the player is at (0,6). Action U moves to (0,7) at turn 81 (safe, as turn 81 is after the dangerous period for y=7).\n- At turn 81, the player is at (0,7). Action U moves to (0,8) at turn 82.\n- At turn 82, the player is at (0,8). Action U moves to (0,9) at turn 83.\n\nThis sequence ensures that:\n- The player is never on a dangerous freeway at a dangerous time.\n- y=0 and y=9 are safe as they have no cars.\n- The path reaches (0,9) in minimal turns (H=12, at turn 83).\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 72: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 73: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 74: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 75: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 76: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 77: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 78: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 79: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 80: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 81: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 82: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 78, and the player is at (0,0). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on the freeways y=1 to 8.\n\nImportant: \n- The player moves at each turn by choosing U (up: y+1), D (down: y-1), or S (stay: y unchanged). The player cannot go below 0 or above 9.\n- Collision occurs at turn T only if the player is on a freeway y (between 1 and 8) at that turn and the car on that freeway at turn T has its span covering the x-coordinate 0 (the player's x is always 0).\n\nNote: When the player moves from y to y' at turn T, note that:\n  - At turn T, the player is on freeway y (if y is between 1 and 8) and must avoid cars on that freeway at turn T.\n  - Then, at the next turn (T+1), the player will be on freeway y' (if y' is between 1 and 8) and must avoid cars on that freeway at turn T+1.\n\nOur goal is to go from y=0 (safe, no cars) to y=9 (safe, no cars) passing through freeways 1 to 8 without being at a freeway y at a turn when a car on that freeway covers x=0.\n\nWe are given the car states at turn t1=78. For each freeway k (from 1 to 8) and for each car on that freeway, we have (head, tail, direction, speed). Note the representation:\n\nFor left-moving cars: the car moves leftward. The span is given as [head, tail] at t1, but note that in the update for left-moving:\n  Span(T) = [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]   (and since the car is moving left, the head is the rightmost? Actually, note the example: \n  For a left-moving car, the head is at a higher x than the tail? But the problem states:\n    Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, tau] -> Span(T) = [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\n  This implies that at time T, the car covers from (tau - s*(T-t1)) to (h - s*(T-t1))? But note: if the car is moving left, then the entire car shifts left.\n\nHowever, note the representation in the table:\n\nExample: Freeway 6: (48,83,left,36) -> this seems odd because 48 < 83? But if it's left-moving, then the head (which is the front of the car) should be at a higher x? Or is it that the head is the leading part? Actually, the problem does not specify which is the front. But note the update:\n\n  For left-moving: [h, tau] becomes [h - s*dt, tau - s*dt]. So if the car is moving left, then both endpoints decrease.\n\nBut in the car on freeway 6: head=48, tail=83? That would be [48,83] which is a segment of 36 units? But 83-48=35, which is one less than the length? Actually, the length of the car is |head - tail| + 1? But note: the car is continuous? Actually, the problem says \"span\", so it is the interval [min, max] inclusive? \n\nHowever, note the example: (0, -11) for right-moving. If the car is right-moving, then the update is: [tau, h] -> [tau + s*dt, h + s*dt]. But wait, the representation for right-moving is given as (head, tail, direction, speed) but the update uses [tau, h]? \n\nLooking back: \n  For right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [tau, h] -> Span(T) = [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\"\n\nBut the input gives (head, tail). How do we map? \n\nThe problem says: \"Cars (head h, tail tau, direction d, speed s)\" and then for update:\n\n  Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, tau] \n  Right-moving: Span(t1) = [tau, h]   ??? \n\nWait, the update rule for right-moving says: \n  \"Span(t1) = [tau, h] -> ... \"\n\nBut the input for a right-moving car is given as (head, tail, ...). So for right-moving, the head is the front? Then the tail is the back? Then the entire car is from tail to head? So if the car is moving right, the front is head and the back is tail, and the car is [tail, head]? \n\nBut the update rule for right-moving uses [tau, h] and then shifts right. So in the input, for a right-moving car, the span at t1 is [tau, head] meaning from tail to head? \n\nSo for a right-moving car: the car at t1 covers [tail, head] (with tail <= head). Then at time T, it covers [tail + s*(T-t1), head + s*(T-t1)].\n\nSimilarly, for a left-moving car: the car at t1 covers [head, tail]? But note: the update rule for left-moving uses [h, tau] and then subtracts. But if head and tail are given arbitrarily? \n\nObserve the input: \n  For freeway 3: two cars: (48,37,right,4) and (0,-11,right,4). \n  For the first: head=48, tail=37 -> then the span at t1 is [37,48] (because right-moving: [tau, h] = [37,48]). \n  For the second: head=0, tail=-11 -> span at t1 is [-11,0].\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 6: (48,83,left,36) -> left-moving, so span at t1 is [48,83]? But that would be from 48 to 83, which is 36 units? 83-48+1 = 36? Actually, 83-48 = 35, so the length is 36? Then at time T, it becomes [48-36*(T-t1), 83-36*(T-t1)].\n\nBut note: the problem says collision occurs if 0 is in the span at turn T. So for a car, we have to check if 0 is between the two endpoints (inclusive).\n\nNow, the player starts at (0,0) at turn 78. We want to go to (0,9). We can only change y by at most 1 per turn.\n\nWe must avoid being on a freeway y (from 1 to 8) at a turn T when there is a car on that freeway that has 0 in its span at turn T.\n\nWe are to compute the minimal number of turns H and the sequence of actions.\n\nSince we start at y=0 and need to get to y=9, the minimal number of turns without any obstacles would be 9 turns (each U). But we have to avoid the cars.\n\nWe need to simulate the movement of the cars over time (turns after 78) and plan the player's moves accordingly.\n\nWe are going to consider the state at each turn: the player's y-coordinate and the positions of the cars (which we can compute for any turn T>=78).\n\nBut note: the cars move continuously? Actually, the update is linear with time. We are only concerned with whether at integer turns T, the car's span includes 0.\n\nWe can precompute for each freeway k (1 to 8) and for each car on that freeway, the times (turns) at which the car covers 0? Actually, we are only concerned with the time intervals (in turns) when the car covers 0.\n\nBut note: the car moves at constant speed. For a car:\n\n  If it is right-moving: \n      The span at turn T (T>=78) is [tau + s*(T-78), head + s*(T-78)].\n      We require 0 to be in [tau+s*(T-78), head+s*(T-78)] \n      => tau + s*(T-78) <= 0 <= head + s*(T-78)\n\n      => T-78 >= ceil(( - head) / s) ? Actually, we can solve:\n\n        T-78 must be such that:\n          tau + s*(T-78) <= 0   => T-78 <= (0 - tau) / s\n          and 0 <= head + s*(T-78) => T-78 >= ceil( (0 - head) / s )? \n\n      Actually, the inequalities:\n\n        tau + s*(T-78) <= 0   => T-78 <= (0 - tau) / s   [if s>0, which it is]\n        and head + s*(T-78) >= 0 => T-78 >= ceil( (0 - head) / s )? \n\n      But note: if head is already negative at T=78, then head+s*(T-78) becomes less negative? Actually, we need:\n\n        Let dt = T-78 (nonnegative integer). Then:\n          tau + s*dt <= 0   => dt <= floor( ( - tau ) / s )   [if s>0]\n          head + s*dt >= 0   => dt >= ceil( ( - head ) / s )   [if s>0]\n\n      But note: if the car is moving right, then as dt increases, the entire car moves to the right. So the car covers 0 for dt in the interval:\n\n          dt_min = ceil( ( - head ) / s )   [if head is negative, then we need to move the car so that the head becomes at least 0? Actually, the condition is: the left end (tau+s*dt) must be <=0 and the right end (head+s*dt) must be >=0.\n\n      Actually, we can write:\n\n          tau + s*dt <= 0   => dt <= floor( ( - tau ) / s )\n          head + s*dt >= 0   => dt >= ceil( ( - head ) / s )\n\n      And then the car blocks 0 at turn T=78+dt for dt in [ceil(( - head)/s), floor(( - tau)/s)]? But note: if the car is long enough, then the entire interval is blocked? \n\n      However, let me test with the car on freeway 3: (0,-11,right,4) at t1=78.\n        head=0, tail=-11, so at T=78: \n          span = [tau, head] = [-11,0] -> which includes 0? yes.\n\n        Then at T=79: \n          span = [-11+4, 0+4] = [-7,4] -> 0 is included? yes.\n\n        Actually, the car covers 0 until when? \n          We require: \n            -11 + 4*dt <= 0 -> dt <= 11/4 = 2.75 -> so dt<=2 (since dt integer) -> T=78,79,80: at T=81: -11+4*3 = 1, which is >0? Then the left end becomes 1, so the car no longer covers 0? Actually, at T=81: [1,12] -> 0 not included.\n\n        But also: \n          head + 4*dt >=0 -> 0+4*dt>=0 -> always true for dt>=0.\n\n        So the blocking turns: dt=0,1,2 -> T=78,79,80.\n\n        Alternatively, we can compute the interval for dt:\n\n          dt_min = ceil( (0 - head) / s ) = ceil( (0-0)/4 ) = ceil(0)=0\n          dt_max = floor( (0 - tau) / s ) = floor( (0 - (-11)) /4 ) = floor(11/4)=2\n\n        So dt in [0,2] -> T=78,79,80.\n\n      But wait: at T=78, the car is present? Yes, and we are at turn 78, and the player is at freeway? We start at y=0 (which is not a freeway) so we are safe at T=78.\n\n      However, if the player were to be on freeway 3 at turn 78,79,80, then it would be blocked.\n\nSimilarly, for the other car on freeway 3: (48,37,right,4). \n  head=48, tail=37 -> span at T=78: [37,48] -> 0 not included. When will it cover 0?\n    We require:\n        37 + 4*dt <= 0 -> 4*dt <= -37 -> never, since dt>=0 -> so this car never covers 0.\n\nSo we can ignore this car.\n\nTherefore, for each car, we can compute the set of turns T (>=78) for which 0 is in the car's span.\n\nBut note: multiple cars on the same freeway: if at least one car covers 0 at turn T, then the freeway is blocked at T.\n\nSo for each freeway k, we want to know the set of turns T (>=78) for which there is at least one car on k that covers 0 at T.\n\nWe can compute for each freeway k the set of T (>=78) that are blocked.\n\nWe'll do:\n\n  For k=1 to 8:\n      blocked_turns[k] = set of turns T (>=78) such that at turn T, freeway k has a car covering 0.\n\nThen, we do a BFS (or Dijkstra, but since cost per move is 1, BFS) over the state (turn, y) from (78,0) to (T,9) for some T, avoiding states where if y is in [1,8] and the turn is blocked for that freeway.\n\nBut note: the state space: \n  turn: from 78 to ...? We need to go from y=0 to y=9. The minimal turns is 9, but we might have to wait. How long? The car patterns are periodic? \n\nActually, the cars move at constant speed. The blocking intervals for each freeway are contiguous? \n\nBut note: for a given freeway, the blocking events might be periodic? Or not? Actually, each car blocks a contiguous set of turns? \n\nBut multiple cars on the same freeway might block multiple intervals. However, we can precompute for each freeway k the set of turns (>=78) that are blocked.\n\nWe can compute the blocked intervals for each freeway. Then, for a given freeway k, we can represent the blocked turns as a union of intervals.\n\nBut note: the problem is small: we are starting at turn 78 and we are only going to simulate until we reach y=9. The minimal H is at least 9, but we might have to wait a few turns. How long? The cars move at integer speeds and the positions are integers? Actually, the update is linear and the span endpoints are integers? So the blocking conditions are over integers.\n\nWe can precompute for each freeway k the set of turns T (>=78) that are blocked. Since we are going to do a BFS and the state (turn, y) might have a turn that goes up to 78 + (max_wait+9). What is the maximum wait? \n\nObserve the cars: the speeds are 4 and 36. The blocking intervals are finite. For example, for freeway 3: we have one car that blocks T=78,79,80. Then it moves away. The other car never blocks.\n\nBut note: the car (0,-11,right,4) blocks for 3 turns. Then it's gone. Similarly, other cars?\n\nLet's compute for each freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (-48,-59,right,4)\n  head=-48, tail=-59 -> for right-moving: span at T: [tau + s*dt, head + s*dt] = [-59+4*dt, -48+4*dt]\n  Blocking when: -59+4*dt <= 0 <= -48+4*dt\n    => 4*dt >= 48? (from 0<=-48+4*dt -> 4*dt>=48 -> dt>=12)\n       and 4*dt <=59? (from -59+4*dt<=0 -> dt<=59/4=14.75 -> dt<=14)\n    So dt in [12,14] -> T=78+12=90, 91, 92.\n\nFreeway 2: same as freeway1: (-48,-59,right,4) -> same blocking: T=90,91,92.\n\nFreeway 3: two cars:\n  car1: (48,37,right,4): never blocks 0 (as above).\n  car2: (0,-11,right,4): blocks T=78,79,80.\n\nFreeway 4: same as freeway3: blocks T=78,79,80.\n\nFreeway 5: same as freeway3: blocks T=78,79,80.\n\nFreeway 6: one car: (48,83,left,36)\n  For left-moving: span at T: [h - s*dt, tau - s*dt] = [48-36*dt, 83-36*dt]\n  Blocking when: 48-36*dt <= 0 <= 83-36*dt\n    => 0<=83-36*dt -> 36*dt<=83 -> dt<=83/36=2.305 -> dt<=2\n        and 48-36*dt<=0 -> 36*dt>=48 -> dt>=48/36=1.333 -> dt>=2? \n        Actually: dt>= ceil(48/36)=ceil(1.333)=2? \n        and dt<= floor(83/36)=2? \n        So only dt=2? -> T=78+2=80.\n\n        Check: \n          dt=2: [48-72, 83-72] = [-24,11] -> 0 is in [-24,11]? yes.\n          dt=1: [48-36,83-36] = [12,47] -> 0 not included.\n          dt=0: [48,83] -> 0 not included.\n\n        So freeway6 blocked only at T=80.\n\nFreeway7: three cars:\n  car1: (48,37,right,4): never blocks.\n  car2: (12,1,right,4): \n        head=12, tail=1 -> right-moving: [1+4*dt, 12+4*dt]\n        Blocking: 1+4*dt<=0<=12+4*dt -> \n          0<=12+4*dt -> always true for dt>=0? \n          1+4*dt<=0 -> 4*dt<=-1 -> never. \n        So not blocking.\n\n  car3: (-24,-35,right,4): \n        head=-24, tail=-35 -> span: [-35+4*dt, -24+4*dt]\n        Blocking: -35+4*dt<=0<=-24+4*dt\n          => 4*dt>=24 -> dt>=6\n          => 4*dt<=35 -> dt<=35/4=8.75 -> dt<=8\n          So dt in [6,8] -> T=78+6=84,85,86.\n\nFreeway8: (-48,-59,right,4) -> same as freeway1: T=90,91,92.\n\nSummary of blocked turns per freeway:\n\nFreeway1: {90,91,92}\nFreeway2: {90,91,92}\nFreeway3: {78,79,80}\nFreeway4: {78,79,80}\nFreeway5: {78,79,80}\nFreeway6: {80}\nFreeway7: {84,85,86}\nFreeway8: {90,91,92}\n\nWe now have the blocked turns for each freeway.\n\nWe must avoid being on freeway k at turn T if T is in the blocked set for k.\n\nWe start at (turn=78, y=0). At turn 78, we are at y=0 (safe). We can choose U, D, or S.\n\nOur goal: reach (turn=T, y=9) for some T.\n\nWe can model the state as (t, y) where t is the current turn (>=78) and y in [0,9]. \n\nThe actions: U, D, S. The next state: \n  if U: (t+1, y+1) [if y<9, else if y==9, then U is invalid? But the problem says y_{t+1} in [0,9]. So if at y=9 and we choose U, we remain at 9? Actually, the update: \n  y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t, and then clamped to [0,9]? But the problem says \"y_{t+1} in [0,9]\". However, the movement: \n    if a_t = U and y_t=9, then y_{t+1} = 9? because it cannot go above 9? Similarly, if at 0 and D, then stays at 0.\n\nBut note: the problem states: \"y_{t+1} \\in [0,9]\". So we assume that if the move would take it outside, it stays at the boundary? \n\nBut the update rule does not explicitly say clamping. However, the condition says \"y_{t+1} in [0,9]\". So we must interpret that the move is only allowed if the new y is in [0,9]. But the problem does not say that the move is disallowed. It says the update happens and then the position is in [0,9]. So we assume that if the move would take it above 9, it remains at 9? Similarly for 0.\n\nBut to be safe, we assume the move is clamped. For example, at y=9, U -> y=9.\n\nSimilarly, at y=0, D -> y=0.\n\nNow, we do BFS in the state (t, y). We start at (78,0). We want to reach any state with y=9.\n\nThe cost is the number of turns (so we want the smallest t such that we can be at y=9).\n\nWe generate next states: \n  From (t,y), we can do:\n    S: (t+1, y)\n    U: (t+1, min(y+1,9))\n    D: (t+1, max(y-1,0))\n\nBut note: if we are at y=9 and we do U, we stay at 9. Similarly for D at 0.\n\nHowever, we must avoid states where at the new turn t+1 and the new y (if that new y is between 1 and 8) and if t+1 is blocked for that freeway (y), then we cannot go there.\n\nBut note: when we move from (t,y_old) to (t+1, y_new), at turn t+1 we are at freeway y_new. So if y_new is in [1,8] and the turn t+1 is blocked for freeway y_new, then we cannot use that state.\n\nAlso, note that at the start: at turn 78, we are at y=0 (safe). Then we choose an action for turn 78, which will lead to state at turn 79.\n\nWe are to output the sequence of actions for turns starting at t1 (78) until the turn when we reach y=9.\n\nWe'll do BFS by the number of turns (which is t - 78). We start with state (78,0) and then we try the three actions.\n\nWe break when we reach y=9.\n\nWe must record the path. We can store for each state (t,y) the action that led to it and the previous state.\n\nWe note that the turn t can go up to ...? Since the blocked turns are only in the near future (the latest blocked turn we see is 92), we can set a limit. The minimal number of turns is 9, but if we have to wait, we might go up to, say, 100.\n\nBut note: the freeways 1,2,8 are blocked at 90,91,92. So if we are still on the lower freeways at turn 90, we might get stuck? But we can plan to avoid being on freeway1,2,8 at turns 90,91,92. Similarly, freeway7 is blocked at 84,85,86.\n\nWe'll simulate until we reach y=9.\n\nWe'll use a queue for BFS: each state is (t, y). We mark visited states? But note: we might come to the same (t,y) by different paths? Actually, we don't care: if we get to (t,y) and then we can move the same as from a previous occurrence, we don't need to revisit. But note: we are only storing (t,y). However, the path might matter? Actually, the future moves only depend on the current state. So we can mark (t,y) as visited.\n\nBut note: we might have the same (t,y) but with different paths? But the future is the same. So we don't need to revisit (t,y).\n\nWe'll use a visited set: states (t,y) that we have already expanded.\n\nSteps:\n\n  Let dist = 0 (number of steps from start) and we start at (78,0). \n  We want to reach y=9.\n\n  We use a queue: (t, y, path) but storing the whole path might be heavy. Instead, we store the state and then we can backtrack the actions via a parent dictionary: parent[(t,y)] = (prev_t, prev_y, action)\n\n  Alternatively, we can store for each state the action that we took to get there and the previous state.\n\n  We'll do:\n\n      Let Q be a queue. We start: state (78,0). \n      Let parent: dict, key: (t,y), value: (prev_t, prev_y, action) and for the start state, parent is None.\n\n      While Q not empty:\n          pop state (t,y)\n          if y==9: then we are done. The total turns from start: t - 78. The number of actions: H = t - 78? Actually, we started at turn 78 and we did actions at turns 78,79,...,t-1? So the sequence of actions is for turns 78 to t-1, so H = t - 78.\n\n          Then we can backtrack to get the sequence.\n\n          Else, for each action a in [U,D,S]:\n              new_y = \n                 if a='U': min(y+1,9)\n                 if a='D': max(y-1,0)\n                 if a='S': y\n\n              new_t = t+1\n\n              Now, if new_y is 0 or 9 -> safe (no cars). \n              If new_y is between 1 and 8, then we check if new_t is in the blocked set for freeway new_y -> if yes, skip.\n\n              Also, if we have visited (new_t, new_y) before, skip.\n\n              Otherwise, add (new_t, new_y) to the queue and record parent: parent[(new_t,new_y)] = (t,y,a)\n\n  Then when we reach a goal, we backtrack: \n      Start from (t_final,9). Then we know the action that led to (t_final,9) was taken at turn t_final-1? Actually, the action is taken at the current turn to get to the next state.\n\n      Specifically: \n          At state (t,y), we choose an action a, which leads to (t+1, new_y).\n\n      So the action at turn t is a.\n\n      Therefore, to get the sequence for turns 78 to t_final-1 (since the last action is at turn t_final-1 that leads to (t_final,9)), we need to backtrack the actions from the goal state.\n\n      We start at (t_final,9). We get the parent: which is (t, y, a) such that from (t,y) we did action a to get to (t_final,9) at time t_final = t+1.\n\n      Then the action at turn t (which is t_final-1) is a.\n\n      Then we go to (t,y) and so on until we get to (78,0).\n\n      Then we reverse the sequence of actions? Actually, we traverse from goal to start, so the actions are in reverse order.\n\n      We can store the actions as we backtrack: from turn t_final-1 down to 78.\n\nImplementation:\n\n  We'll use a dictionary: parent[ (t,y) ] = (prev_t, prev_y, action_taken_at_prev_t)\n\n  How we get to (t,y): from (prev_t, prev_y) by taking action at turn prev_t, which led to (t,y) at turn t = prev_t+1.\n\n  So for the goal (t_g,9): the last action was taken at turn t_g-1.\n\n  Then we backtrack: \n        current_state = (t_g,9)\n        while current_state != (78,0):\n            (t,y) = current_state\n            (prev_t, prev_y, a) = parent[(t,y)]\n            then the action at turn prev_t is a.\n            then set current_state = (prev_t, prev_y)\n\n        Then the sequence of actions: from turn 78 to turn t_g-1.\n\n  But note: the start state (78,0) has no action (we haven't taken an action yet). The first action is at turn 78 to go to turn79.\n\n  Actually, the start state: at turn78, we are at (78,0). Then we choose an action for turn78 to go to (79, new_y).\n\n  So the sequence of actions we get from backtracking will be the actions taken at turns: t_g-1, t_g-2, ... , 78. So we need to reverse the list to get from turn78 to t_g-1.\n\nNow, let's run the BFS.\n\nWe'll create a visited set and a queue. We start:\n\n  state: (78,0) -> mark visited.\n\n  Then from (78,0), we can do:\n      S: new_y = 0, new_t=79 -> at turn79, y=0 -> safe (since 0 is not a freeway). -> state (79,0)\n      U: new_y=1, new_t=79 -> but freeway1 at turn79: blocked? \n          Freeway1: blocked at T=90,91,92 -> 79 not blocked -> safe. -> state (79,1)\n      D: new_y=0 -> same as S? Actually, at y=0, D: new_y=0 -> (79,0) same as S.\n\n  So from (78,0): we have two distinct next states: (79,0) and (79,1).\n\nThen we continue.\n\nWe are looking for the minimal H (which is the number of turns from 78 until the turn when we are at y=9). The minimal H is the minimal t-78 such that we reach (t,9). Since we are doing BFS by time, the first time we reach y=9 we have the minimal H.\n\nBut note: we are expanding by increasing t.\n\nNow, we must avoid being on a freeway at a blocked turn.\n\nWe have the blocked sets for each freeway:\n\nf1: {90,91,92}\nf2: {90,91,92}\nf3: {78,79,80}\nf4: {78,79,80}\nf5: {78,79,80}\nf6: {80}\nf7: {84,85,86}\nf8: {90,91,92}\n\nWe'll simulate:\n\nLevel 0: (78,0)\n\nLevel 1 (turn79): \n  (79,0): safe (y=0)\n  (79,1): safe (y=1, freeway1 not blocked at 79)\n\nLevel 2 (turn80): from (79,0) and (79,1)\n\nFrom (79,0):\n  S: (80,0) -> safe\n  U: (80,1) -> freeway1: blocked? 80 not in {90,91,92} -> safe\n  D: (80,0) -> same as S\n\nFrom (79,1):\n  S: (80,1) -> same as above? \n  U: (80,2) -> freeway2: blocked? 80 not in {90,91,92} -> safe\n  D: (80,0) -> safe\n\nSo states at turn80: (80,0), (80,1), (80,2)\n\nBut note: at turn80, if we are on freeway3,4,5,6: we must check:\n\n  freeway3: blocked at 80 -> so if we are at y=3 at turn80, we crash? but we don't have y=3 at turn80.\n\nSimilarly, freeway6: blocked at 80 -> so if we are at y=6 at turn80, we crash.\n\nBut we don't have y=3 or y=6 at turn80.\n\nLevel 3 (turn81):\n\nFrom (80,0):\n  S: (81,0)\n  U: (81,1) -> freeway1 at 81: not blocked -> safe\n  D: (81,0) -> same as S\n\nFrom (80,1):\n  S: (81,1) -> safe\n  U: (81,2) -> freeway2 at 81: not blocked -> safe\n  D: (81,0) -> safe\n\nFrom (80,2):\n  S: (81,2) -> safe\n  U: (81,3) -> freeway3: blocked? freeway3: blocked at {78,79,80} -> 81 not blocked -> safe\n  D: (81,1) -> safe\n\nSo states: (81,0), (81,1), (81,2), (81,3)\n\nWe continue until we get to y=9.\n\nBut note: we must avoid freeway7 at turns 84,85,86. And freeway1,2,8 at 90,91,92.\n\nWe want the minimal H. The minimal without obstacles is 9: so at turn78+9=87 we can be at y=9? \n\nBut we have to avoid the obstacles. We can try to go as fast as possible.\n\nWe start at y=0 at turn78.\n\nWe can do:\n\n  turn78: U -> y=1 at turn79.\n  turn79: U -> y=2 at turn80.\n  turn80: U -> y=3 at turn81. -> but freeway3 is blocked at turn80? but at turn81 we are at freeway3? and turn81 is not blocked for freeway3 -> safe.\n\n  turn81: U -> y=4 at turn82 -> freeway4: blocked at 78,79,80 -> turn82 not blocked -> safe.\n  turn82: U -> y=5 at turn83 -> freeway5: blocked at 78,79,80 -> turn83 not blocked -> safe.\n  turn83: U -> y=6 at turn84 -> freeway6: blocked only at turn80 -> turn84 not blocked -> safe? \n      But freeway7 is blocked at 84? but we are at freeway6 at turn84, not freeway7 -> safe.\n\n  turn84: U -> y=7 at turn85 -> freeway7: blocked at 84,85,86 -> turn85 is blocked! -> crash.\n\nSo we cannot do U at turn84.\n\nWe need to avoid being on freeway7 at turns 84,85,86.\n\nSo at turn83: we are at y=5? Actually, at turn83 we are at y=6? \n\nWait, we did:\n\n  turn78: U -> y=1 at79\n  turn79: U -> y=2 at80\n  turn80: U -> y=3 at81\n  turn81: U -> y=4 at82\n  turn82: U -> y=5 at83\n  turn83: U -> y=6 at84 -> freeway6: safe? \n      But then at turn84: if we do U, we go to y=7 at turn85? \n          Actually: at turn84: we are at y=6 -> then we do U: at turn85 we are at y=7 -> which is freeway7, and turn85 is blocked -> crash.\n\nBut if we do not U at turn83? We could do S or D.\n\nAt turn83: we are at y=5? Actually, at the end of turn82 we are at y=5 (at turn83). Then we can choose:\n\n  Option 1: at turn83: S -> stay at y=5 at turn84 -> freeway5: blocked at 78,79,80 -> turn84 not blocked -> safe.\n\n  Then at turn84: U -> y=6 at turn85 -> freeway6: blocked? freeway6 only at 80 -> safe.\n          then turn85: U -> y=7 at turn86 -> freeway7: blocked at 86? yes -> crash.\n\n  Option 2: at turn83: D -> y=4 at turn84 -> freeway4: safe.\n\nBut then we are going backward.\n\nAlternatively, we can wait at y=5 for a few turns? \n\nBut note: we have to avoid freeway7 at 84,85,86. So we cannot be on freeway7 at those turns. \n\nBut we are at y=5 at turn83. We want to get to y=9. We have to go through freeway7 at some turn. We must avoid turns 84,85,86 for freeway7.\n\nSo we can wait at y=5 until turn87? \n\nAt turn83: we are at y=5 -> then:\n\n  turn83: S -> turn84: y=5 (safe)\n  turn84: S -> turn85: y=5 (safe)\n  turn85: S -> turn86: y=5 (safe)\n  turn86: U -> turn87: y=6 (safe) [freeway6: blocked only at 80 -> safe]\n  turn87: U -> turn88: y=7 -> freeway7: at turn88 -> blocked? freeway7 blocked at 84,85,86 -> 88 not blocked -> safe.\n  turn88: U -> turn89: y=8 -> freeway8: blocked? at turn89: freeway8 blocked at 90,91,92 -> safe.\n  turn89: U -> turn90: y=9 -> goal.\n\nTotal turns: 90 - 78 = 12 turns.\n\nBut is there a faster way?\n\nWe might avoid waiting three turns. \n\nWe are at y=5 at turn83. We need to be at freeway7 at a turn not in {84,85,86}. The next safe turn for freeway7 is 87 or later.\n\nBut we can also go up to y=6 and wait there? \n\nAt turn83: U -> y=6 at turn84 -> safe (freeway6 not blocked at 84). Then at turn84: we are at y=6. We cannot go to y=7 at turn85 (because freeway7 blocked at 85). So we must wait at y=6 until turn87.\n\n  turn84: S -> y=6 at turn85 -> safe (freeway6 only blocked at 80)\n  turn85: S -> y=6 at turn86 -> safe\n  turn86: U -> y=7 at turn87 -> safe (freeway7: turn87 not blocked)\n  turn87: U -> y=8 at turn88 -> freeway8: safe (turn88 not blocked)\n  turn88: U -> y=9 at turn89 -> goal.\n\nTotal turns: 89-78=11 turns.\n\nSimilarly, we can see:\n\n  turn78: U -> y=1 at79\n  turn79: U -> y=2 at80\n  turn80: U -> y=3 at81 -> safe (freeway3 blocked at80? but at turn81 we are at freeway3? no: we are at freeway3 at turn81? \n          Actually, at turn81: we are at y=3 -> freeway3. And freeway3 is blocked at 78,79,80 -> 81 is safe.\n\n  turn81: U -> y=4 at82 -> safe\n  turn82: U -> y=5 at83 -> safe\n  turn83: U -> y=6 at84 -> safe\n  turn84: S -> y=6 at85 -> safe\n  turn85: S -> y=6 at86 -> safe\n  turn86: U -> y=7 at87 -> safe\n  turn87: U -> y=8 at88 -> safe\n  turn88: U -> y=9 at89 -> goal.\n\nSo 11 turns: from turn78 to turn88 (the last action at turn88 leads to turn89 at y=9). So the actions are for turns 78 to 88 (inclusive) -> 11 actions.\n\nBut we started at turn78: the actions are taken at turns: 78,79,...,88. Then at turn89 we are at y=9. So the sequence has 11 actions.\n\nBut note: the goal is to have y_{t1+H-1}=9. Here, t1=78, so we want at turn (78+H-1)=89? Then H=12? \n\nWait, the sequence of actions: \n   We take actions at turns: t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\n   Then the state after the last action is at turn t1+H.\n\n   And we require that at turn t1+H-1 we are at (0,9)? \n\n   Actually, the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning t from 0 to H-1, so the actions are for turns: t1+0, t1+1, ... , t1+H-1. Then after the last action, we are at turn t1+H. And we require that at turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9)? \n\n   But note: the action at turn t1+H-1 is taken and then the state at turn t1+H is determined. But the problem says: \"reach (0,9)\" at turn t1+H-1? \n\n   Actually, the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\".\n\n   \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions ... to reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\"\n\n   And the player position at the current turn (t1) is (0,0). Then we take an action at t1, which leads to t1+1, and so on.\n\n   So at turn t1, we are at (0,0). After H-1 actions, we are at turn t1+H-1? \n\n   Actually: \n        At turn t1: we are at (0, y_{t1}) = (0,0).\n        We take action a_{t1} -> then at turn t1+1: we are at (0,y_{t1+1})\n        ...\n        We take action a_{t1+H-1} -> then at turn t1+H: we are at (0,y_{t1+H})\n\n   But the problem says: we want to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1? \n\n   Actually, the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\". \n\n   So we require that at turn t1+H-1, the player is at (0,9). \n\n   But in our simulation, we are at (0,9) at turn89. And we started at turn78. Then we require that at turn78+H-1 = 89 -> so H-1 = 11 -> H=12.\n\n   But then the actions are from turn78 to turn78+11 = turn89? \n\n   However, the sequence of actions: we take an action at each turn from 78 to 89? That's 12 actions? \n\n   But note: the last action (at turn89) would lead to turn90. But we are already at (0,9) at turn89? \n\n   How do we get to (0,9) at turn89? \n\n   We must have been at (0,8) at turn88, then did U at turn88 to get to (0,9) at turn89.\n\n   Or we were at (0,9) at turn88 and did S or U (but then we stay at 9) at turn88 to be at 9 at turn89? \n\n   But the problem says: we want to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1. \n\n   So we can be at (0,9) at turn89 by:\n\n        turn88: we are at (0,8) -> then at turn88 we do U -> then at turn89: (0,9).\n\n        or turn88: we are at (0,9) -> then at turn88 we do S -> then at turn89: (0,9).\n\n   So we don't necessarily need to take an action at turn89? \n\n   But the sequence of actions is defined for t=0 to H-1: so the actions are taken at turns: t1, t1+1, ... , t1+H-1. And then at turn t1+H-1 (the last turn we take an action) we are at (0,9)? \n\n   Actually, the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning that the actions are for the turns: t1+0, t1+1, ... , t1+H-1. Then after taking the last action (at turn t1+H-1), we are at the next turn (t1+H) at a new state? \n\n   But the requirement is: we must be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1. \n\n   This is confusing.\n\n   Let me re-read: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\"\n\n   So at turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9). \n\n   How did we get there? \n\n   The action taken at turn t1+H-1 would lead to the state at turn t1+H. But we are at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1. So the action we take at turn t1+H-1 is not what gets us to (0,9) at turn t1+H-1. Then how?\n\n   Actually, the state at turn t1+H-1 is determined by the previous action (at turn t1+H-2). \n\n   Therefore, we do not take an action at turn t1+H-1? \n\n   But the sequence of actions is from t=0 to H-1: so we take H actions? \n\n   The problem says: the sequence of actions is for the turns: t1, t1+1, ... , t1+H-1. \n\n   Then the state at turn t1+H-1 is the state after taking the action at turn t1+H-2? \n\n   Actually, the state at turn t is the state after taking the action at turn t-1? \n\n   The update rule: \n        y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t   [where Delta y_t is determined by a_t]\n\n   So at turn t, the player is at y_t. Then we choose a_t. Then at turn t+1, we are at y_{t+1}.\n\n   Therefore, at turn t1+H-1, we are at y_{t1+H-1}. This state is the result of the action a_{t1+H-2} taken at turn t1+H-2.\n\n   And we require that y_{t1+H-1} = 9.\n\n   Then the last action we take is at turn t1+H-1? But that action would lead to turn t1+H. But we don't care about that state.\n\n   However, the problem says: we must output the actions for turns t1 to t1+H-1. \n\n   But to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1, we do not need to take an action at turn t1+H-1? \n\n   Actually, we can take an action at turn t1+H-1, but then we are already at 9? So we could do S or U (if at 9, U stays at 9) at turn t1+H-1? \n\n   But the problem does not say we must stop at the goal. It says we must be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1. \n\n   So we can take the action at turn t1+H-1 arbitrarily? But the goal is already achieved at the beginning of the turn? \n\n   Actually, at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9). Then we take an action? \n\n   But the problem does not specify that we stop. So we must take an action at turn t1+H-1? \n\n   However, the minimal H is defined as the minimal number of turns to reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1. \n\n   But note: the player starts at turn t1 at (0,0). Then we take actions at turns t1, t1+1, ... until we are at (0,9) at some turn.\n\n   The minimal H such that we are at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1.\n\n   So H is the number of turns we simulate? \n\n   Alternatively, H is the number of actions? \n\n   Let me see: \n        At turn t1 (78): we are at (0,0). We haven't taken any action yet.\n        Then we take an action at turn78 -> we are at turn79 at y1.\n\n        We want to be at turn t1+H-1 at (0,9). \n\n        So the turn when we are at (0,9) is t = t1 + H - 1.\n\n        And we take actions at turns: t1, t1+1, ... , t1+H-1? That's H actions.\n\n        But then we are at (0,9) at turn t1+H (because after the last action at turn t1+H-1, we are at turn t1+H).\n\n        This is a contradiction.\n\n   I think the problem means:\n\n        We are at turn t1 at (0,y0). Then we take H actions: at turns t1, t1+1, ... , t1+H-1. Then at turn t1+H, we are at (0,9).\n\n        But the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\".\n\n   Let me check the problem statement: \n        \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9), ... \"\n\n        and then: \"such that y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\n   So it says: y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\n   Therefore, at turn t1+H-1, the player is at y=9.\n\n   How is this achieved? \n\n        At turn t1: we are at y0=0.\n        After the first action (at turn t1): we are at turn t1+1 at y1.\n        ...\n        After the (H-1)-th action (at turn t1+H-2): we are at turn t1+H-1 at y_{H-1}=9.\n\n   Therefore, the sequence of actions is for t from 0 to H-1: but that means we take actions at turns: t1, t1+1, ... , t1+H-1? \n\n   But that would be H actions. Then we would be at turn t1+H at y_{t1+H}. \n\n   But we require y_{t1+H-1}=9. \n\n   This implies that we take actions only at turns t1 to t1+H-2? \n\n   The index t in the sequence: t=0,...,H-1: \n        a_{t1+0} is the action at turn t1.\n        a_{t1+1} is the action at turn t1+1.\n        ...\n        a_{t1+H-1} is the action at turn t1+H-1.\n\n   Then after taking a_{t1+H-1} at turn t1+H-1, we are at turn t1+H at y_{t1+H}. \n\n   But we require y_{t1+H-1}=9. \n\n   So at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at y_{t1+H-1}=9. Then we take an action a_{t1+H-1}? \n\n   But the problem does not require that we stay at 9? It only requires that at turn t1+H-1 we are at 9. \n\n   So if at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 we are at 9, then we can take any action? \n\n   However, to be at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we must have gotten there by an action at turn t1+H-2.\n\n   Therefore, we take actions from turn t1 to turn t1+H-2 to get to y_{t1+H-1}=9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1.\n\n   Then the last action we take is at turn t1+H-2? \n\n   But the sequence is defined for t=0 to H-1: so we take H actions. \n\n   This implies that we take an action at turn t1+H-1 even though we are already at 9? \n\n   But the requirement is satisfied: at turn t1+H-1 (before taking the action? or after?) we are at 9.\n\n   Actually, the state y_t is the state at the beginning of turn t? or after the action?\n\n   The problem says: \"Player Position at turn t1: (0,0)\" and \"Car State at turn t1\".\n\n   Then we choose an action a_{t1} and then we update to turn t1+1.\n\n   So at the beginning of turn t, we are at y_t.\n\n   Then we choose a_t, and then at the beginning of turn t+1, we are at y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t.\n\n   Therefore, the requirement is: at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\n   And we have taken actions at turns: t1, t1+1, ... , t1+H-2. \n\n   Then the sequence of actions should be for turns t1 to t1+H-2: that is H-1 actions.\n\n   But the problem says the sequence is indexed by t=0 to H-1: which is H actions.\n\n   And the minimal number of turns H? \n\n   This is inconsistent.\n\n   Alternatively, the problem might consider that we are at (0,9) at the turn after the last action. \n\n   But the problem explicitly says: y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\n   Let me assume that the state is updated as:\n\n        state at turn t: (y_t)\n        then we take action a_t -> then we get y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t.\n\n   Then the requirement is: at turn t1+H-1, the player is at y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\n   How many actions have been taken? \n\n        We start at turn t1: y_{t1}=0.\n        After 0 actions, we are at turn t1.\n        After 1 action (at turn t1), we are at turn t1+1.\n        ...\n        After k actions, we are at turn t1+k.\n\n        So to be at turn t1+H-1, we have taken (H-1) actions.\n\n   Therefore, the sequence of actions should be for k=0 to H-2: but the problem says the sequence is for t=0 to H-1.\n\n   This is not matching.\n\n   Given the confusion, I will assume that the goal is to be at (0,9) at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, and we will have taken H-1 actions (at turns t1 to t1+H-2). But the problem says the sequence has H actions.\n\n   Alternatively, the problem might mean that H is the total number of turns we are simulating, including the start. \n\n   But the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\", and then the sequence has H actions? \n\n   I think there is a mistake in the problem statement.\n\n   Let me look at the answer format: \n\n        Turn t1: a_{t1}\n        Turn t1+1: a_{t1+1}\n        ...\n\n   and the last turn in the sequence is turn t1+H-1.\n\n   And we require that at turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9). \n\n   But how can we be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1 if the action at turn t1+H-1 is taken and then we update to turn t1+H? \n\n   Unless the state at turn t is defined AFTER the action? \n\n   The problem says: \n        Player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t\n\n   This suggests that at turn t+1, the position is updated. So the state at turn t+1 is after the action at turn t.\n\n   Then at the beginning of the game, turn78: we are given (0,0). This is before any action.\n\n   Then we take action at turn78, and then at turn79 we are at y79.\n\n   So the state at turn78 is given, and then we take action a78 to go to turn79.\n\n   Therefore, the state at turn78 is the initial state.\n\n   We want to be at (0,9) at turn78+H-1.\n\n   And we take actions at turns78,79,...,78+H-1? \n\n   But then the last action at turn78+H-1 would affect turn78+H.\n\n   So to be at (0,9) at turn78+H-1, we must have already been there at the beginning of turn78+H-1, and then we take an action (which might change it, but we can choose S to stay).\n\n   But if we are at 9 at the beginning of turn78+H-1, then we can do S to stay at 9 for turn78+H.\n\n   But the requirement is only for turn78+H-1.\n\n   However, the action taken at turn78+H-1 might move us away? \n\n   But we can choose S.\n\n   Therefore, to be at (0,9) at turn78+H-1, we must be at 9 at the beginning of that turn, and then we do S.\n\n   But the action for turn78+H-1 is part of the sequence.\n\n   Therefore, the number of actions is H.\n\n   And the turns we simulate: from turn78 to turn78+H-1 (actions taken) and then at turn78+H-1 we are at 9.\n\n   How many turns have passed from turn78 to turn78+H-1? It is (78+H-1 - 78) = H-1 turns of game time? \n\n   But the minimal H is the number of actions.\n\n   In our example, we want to be at (0,9) at turn89.\n\n   So 78+H-1 = 89 -> H-1=11 -> H=12.\n\n   And the actions are for turns78 to turn89 (12 actions).\n\n   Then the last action (at turn89) will be S (or U) to ensure we are at 9 at turn89? \n\n   But note: at the beginning of turn89, we must be at 9. Then we do S at turn89 to stay at 9 for turn90.\n\n   Therefore, we require that at the beginning of turn89, we are at 9.\n\n   So in our BFS, we require states (t,9) for t>=78, and we want the minimal t such that we can be at (0,9) at turn t, and then the number of actions is H = t - 78 + 1? \n\n   Because we start at turn78 and we end at turn89: the number of actions is the number of turns from 78 to 89 inclusive? That's 12 actions.\n\n   Specifically, actions at turns: 78,79,80,81,82,83,84,85,86,87,88,89 -> 12 actions.\n\n   And then at the beginning of turn89, we are at 9. Then we take the action at turn89 (S) to stay at 9 for turn90.\n\n   But the requirement is only for turn89.\n\n   Therefore, in our BFS, we search for any state (t,9) for t>=78, and then the number of actions is t - 78 + 1.\n\n   We want the minimal t such that we can reach (t,9)? Then H = t - 78 + 1.\n\n   Or we want the minimal H, which is the number of actions.\n\n   But if we find a state (t,9) with t=87, then H = 87-78+1=10, which is smaller than 12.\n\n   So we should search for the smallest H, i.e., the smallest t for which we can be at (t,9).\n\n   In our earlier plan, we can be at (89,9) -> H=12.\n\n   But is there a way to be at (0,9) at an earlier turn?\n\n   Let's try to see if we can get to y=9 by turn87.\n\n   turn78: 0\n   turn79: 1\n   turn80: 2\n   turn81: 3\n   turn82: 4\n   turn83: 5\n   turn84: 6\n   turn85: 7  -> but freeway7 at turn85 is blocked! -> crash.\n\n   turn86: 7 (if we wait at 6 on turn84 and turn85) -> then at turn86: if we go to 7, freeway7 at turn86 is blocked -> crash.\n\n   turn87: 7 -> freeway7 at turn87: not blocked.\n\n   So we can be at y=7 at turn87.\n\n   Then turn87: U -> 8 at turn88.\n   turn88: U -> 9 at turn89.\n\n   So we are at 9 at turn89.\n\n   Alternatively, we could try to rush through freeway7 before turn84.\n\n   turn78: U (1)\n   turn79: U (2)\n   turn80: U (3) -> but freeway3 at turn80 is blocked? -> at turn80, if we are at y=3, then freeway3 is blocked -> crash.\n\n   So we cannot be at freeway3 at turn80.\n\n   How about waiting at y=2 at turn80? \n\n   turn78: U (1 at79)\n   turn79: U (2 at80) -> safe (freeway2 not blocked at80)\n   turn80: S (2 at81) -> safe\n   turn81: U (3 at82) -> safe (freeway3 not blocked at82)\n   turn82: U (4 at83) -> safe\n   turn83: U (5 at84) -> safe\n   turn84: U (6 at85) -> safe (freeway6)\n   turn85: we cannot go to 7 because freeway7 blocked at85.\n\n   So we have to wait at y=6 for turns85 and86.\n\n   turn85: S (6 at86)\n   turn86: U (7 at87) -> safe (freeway7 not blocked at87)\n   turn87: U (8 at88)\n   turn88: U (9 at89)\n\n   This is the same as before.\n\n   Can we be at y=9 at turn88? \n\n   That would require being at 9 at the beginning of turn88.\n\n   How?\n        turn87: must be at 8 and then U at turn87 to get to 9 at turn88.\n        So we need to be at 8 at turn87.\n\n        To be at 8 at turn87: \n            turn86: must be at 7 or 8 or 9? \n                If at 7: U at turn86 -> 8 at87.\n                If at 8: S or U at turn86 -> 8 at87.\n                If at 9: then D or S or U -> but we can be at 9 earlier.\n\n        But to be at 7 at turn86: freeway7 at turn86 is blocked -> crash.\n\n        So we cannot be at 7 at turn86.\n\n        Therefore, the earliest we can be at 7 is turn87.\n\n        Then at turn87: we are at 7 -> then U to 8 at turn88.\n        Then at turn88: U to 9 at turn89.\n\n   So the earliest turn for y=9 is 89.\n\n   Therefore, H = 89 - 78 + 1 = 12.\n\n   The actions are for turns78 to turn89 (12 actions).\n\n   Now, we need to output the sequence.\n\n   We have a path to (89,9). How did we get there? \n\n   We can use the BFS and backtrack.\n\n   We know one path:\n\n        turn78: U -> y=1 at79\n        turn79: U -> y=2 at80\n        turn80: S -> y=2 at81   [because at turn80 we are at y=2, and we choose S to stay]\n        turn81: U -> y=3 at82\n        turn82: U -> y=4 at83\n        turn83: U -> y=5 at84\n        turn84: U -> y=6 at85\n        turn85: S -> y=6 at86   [waiting at y=6 for turn85 and turn86]\n        turn86: S -> y=6 at87   [or should we wait only one turn? We can also do only one wait]\n\n        But note: at turn85: if we do U, we go to y=7 at86 -> crash.\n        So we must do S at turn85.\n\n        Then at turn86: we could do U to y=7 at87 -> safe.\n        turn87: U -> y=8 at88\n        turn88: U -> y=9 at89\n\n        Then at turn89: we are at y=9. But we also need to output an action for turn89. \n        We can do S (or U) to stay at 9.\n\n   So the actions:\n\n        turn78: U\n        turn79: U\n        turn80: S\n        turn81: U\n        turn82: U\n        turn83: U\n        turn84: U\n        turn85: S\n        turn86: U\n        turn87: U\n        turn88: U\n        turn89: S   [or U, it doesn't matter]\n\n   Total 12 actions.\n\n   But is there a shorter path in terms of the number of actions? \n\n   We have to wait at some point. The above path has 12 actions.\n\n   Alternatively, we could wait earlier to avoid the freeway7 block.\n\n   For example, at turn83: we are at y=5. We could wait there for two turns:\n\n        turn83: S -> y=5 at84\n        turn84: S -> y=5 at85\n        turn85: U -> y=6 at86\n        turn86: U -> y=7 at87  [safe]\n        turn87: U -> y=8 at88\n        turn88: U -> y=9 at89\n\n        Then the actions:\n\n          78: U ->1\n          79: U ->2\n          80: U ->3 (crash? because freeway3 at80 is blocked) -> no, at turn80: we are at y=3? \n          freeway3 is blocked at turn80 -> so if we are at y=3 at turn80, we crash.\n\n        So we cannot do U at turn79 to arrive at y=3 at80.\n\n   Therefore, we must not be on freeway3,4,5 at turns78,79,80? \n\n   We are on freeway3 at turn81? that's safe.\n\n   So to avoid freeway3 at turn80, we can:\n\n        turn78: U ->1 at79\n        turn79: U ->2 at80\n        turn80: S ->2 at81  [safe]\n        turn81: U ->3 at82\n        turn82: U ->4 at83\n        turn83: U ->5 at84\n        turn84: S ->5 at85  [safe at freeway5? freeway5 only blocked at78,79,80 -> safe]\n        turn85: U ->6 at86  [safe]\n        turn86: U ->7 at87  [safe, freeway7 at87 not blocked]\n        turn87: U ->8 at88\n        turn88: U ->9 at89\n\n        Then at turn89: we are at 9. \n        Actions for turn89: S.\n\n        Total actions: 12.\n\n   Another option: we could try to go faster initially and then slow down.\n\n   Since we have to wait at some point for freeway7, and the block is at 84,85,86, and we need to be at freeway7 at 87 or later, and we can only move one per turn, we must be at least at y=6 by turn86 to get to y=7 at87.\n\n   So the minimal number of actions is 12.\n\n   Now, we need to output the sequence.\n\n   We'll code the BFS to find a path from (78,0) to (89,9) with 12 actions.\n\n   But note: there are multiple paths. We want any one that is minimal in H.\n\n   We'll do BFS by the turn t.\n\n   We start at (78,0).

Then we take action S to stay at 9 for turn90.\n\n   The requirement is that at turn89 (the beginning) we are at 9, which is satisfied.\n\n   So the actions:\n\n        turn78: U\n        turn79: U\n        turn80: S\n        turn81: U\n        turn82: U\n        turn83: U\n        turn84: U\n        turn85: S\n        turn86: U\n        turn87: U\n        turn88: U\n        turn89: S\n\n   But is turn84: U to y=6 at85 -> freeway6 at85: is it blocked? freeway6 is only blocked at80 -> safe.\n\n   turn85: we are at y=6 -> freeway6: safe.\n   turn86: we are at y=6 (from turn85: we did S) -> then U to y=7 at87: freeway7 at87: not blocked.\n\n   So it is safe.\n\n   Therefore, we output:\n\n        Turn 78: U\n        Turn 79: U\n        Turn 80: S\n        Turn 81: U\n        Turn 82: U\n        Turn 83: U\n        Turn 84: U\n        Turn 85: S\n        Turn 86: U\n        Turn 87: U\n        Turn 88: U\n        Turn 89: S\n\n   But note: the last action (at turn89) is not necessary for reaching 9 at turn89? \n        At the beginning of turn89, we are at 9, so we already are there. \n        But the problem asks for a sequence of H=12 actions.\n\n   So we include it.\n\n   We could also do at turn89: U (which would leave us at 9) or D (which would go to 8 at90) but then we are not at 9 at turn89 (we are at9 at the beginning, then we leave) -> but the requirement is only for turn89. \n\n   However, the requirement is to be at9 at turn89, which is the beginning of the turn. Then we are free to do any action.\n\n   But the problem does not require to stay at9. \n\n   However, to be safe, we do S or U.\n\n   We'll do S.\n\n   Alternatively, we could have not waited at turn85 and waited at turn84 and turn85 at y=5? \n\n   But then we would be at y=5 at85, then at86 we go to y=6, then at87 to y=7, at88 to y=8, at89 to y=9.\n\n   That also works.\n\n   Example:\n\n        turn78: U\n        turn79: U\n        turn80: S   [y=2 at81]\n        turn81: U   [3 at82]\n        turn82: U   [4 at83]\n        turn83: U   [5 at84]\n        turn84: S   [5 at85]   [safe at freeway5]\n        turn85: S   [5 at86]   [safe]\n        turn86: U   [6 at87]   [safe]\n        turn87: U   [7 at88]   [safe]\n        turn88: U   [8 at89]   -> then at turn89: we are at 8 at the beginning? \n\n        But we need to be at9 at turn89.\n\n        So this is not valid.\n\n   We must be at9 at the beginning of turn89.\n\n   Therefore, the last move to 9 must be done by an action at turn88.\n\n   So we must be at8 at turn88 (beginning of turn88) and then U to9 at turn89.\n\n   Therefore, the last move (to9) is at turn88.\n\n   Then the action at turn89 is not affecting the requirement. But we still have to output an action for turn89.\n\n   In the first path, we were at9 at the beginning of turn89, and then we do S.\n\n   In the second alternative waiting at y=5 for two turns (84 and85) and then moving:\n\n        turn78: U\n        turn79: U\n        turn80: S   [81:2]\n        turn81: U   [82:3]\n        turn82: U   [83:4]\n        turn83: U   [84:5]\n        turn84: S   [85:5]\n        turn85: U   [86:6]\n        turn86: U   [87:7]\n        turn87: U   [88:8]\n        turn88: U   [89:9]\n        turn89: ?   -> we are at9 at89, then we do S.\n\n   This also has 12 actions.\n\n   So either is fine.\n\n   We'll choose the first one.\n\n   Therefore, the answer is:\n\n        Turn 78: U\n        Turn 79: U\n        Turn 80: S\n        Turn 81: U\n        Turn 82: U\n        Turn 83: U\n        Turn 84: U\n        Turn 85: S\n        Turn 86: U\n        Turn 87: U\n        Turn 88: U\n        Turn 89: S\n\n   But note: at turn84: we do U from y=5 to y=6 at85. Then at turn85: we are at y=6 and do S to stay at6 at86.

We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on the freeways y=1 to 8.\n\nImportant: \n- The player moves vertically: U (+1), D (-1), S (0). The y-coordinate is bounded between 0 and 9.\n- Collision occurs at turn T if at that turn the player is on a freeway y (which is from 1 to 8) and the car on that freeway has a span that includes 0 at turn T.\n\nNote: When moving from y to y' at turn T, at the moment of turn T the player is still on y and will only check the cars on y at turn T. Then at turn T+1, the player is on y' and checks the cars on y' at turn T+1.\n\nWe are given the car states at turn t1 (current turn). For future turns, we can compute the car spans.\n\nCar update:\n- For a left-moving car: span at time T is [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)] (note: the example has head h and tail tau, and for left-moving the head is at the right and tail at left? Actually, the update rule says for left-moving: [h, tau] -> [h - s*dt, tau - s*dt]. Similarly, for right-moving: [tau, h] becomes [tau + s*dt, h + s*dt]. But note the representation in the input:\n\nIn the input, for a car we have (head, tail, direction, speed). However, the update rule for right-moving uses [tau, h] and then becomes [tau + s*dt, h + s*dt]. This suggests that for a right-moving car, at time t1 the car's tail is at tau and head at h (so the car occupies [tau, h] if tau <= h). Similarly, for left-moving, the head is at h and tail at tau, so the car occupies [tau, h] if tau <= h? But then the update for left-moving: [h, tau] -> [h - s*dt, tau - s*dt] — this would be problematic if tau > h? \n\nLet me reinterpret the update rule:\n\nActually, the update rule says:\n- Left-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, tau]\" -> becomes [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\n- Right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [tau, h]\" -> becomes [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut note: in the input for left-moving, we have (h, tau, left, s). The span at t1 is [h, tau]. However, if h > tau, then the car is from tau to h? But then moving left, the entire car shifts left. Similarly, for right-moving, the span at t1 is [tau, h] meaning from tau to h (so tau <= h) and then it shifts right.\n\nBut in the given data, we have:\nFor example, on freeway 3: (48, 37, right, 4) — wait, 48 and 37? 48>37, so if it's right-moving and span is [tau, h] = [37,48]? Then that makes sense: the car is from 37 to 48. Then at turn T, it becomes [37 + 4*(T-84), 48 + 4*(T-84)].\n\nBut then we have another car: (0, -11, right, 4) on freeway 3. So [tau, h] = [-11,0]. Then at T, it becomes [-11 + 4*(T-84), 0 + 4*(T-84)].\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving: freeway 6: (48,83,left,36). But 48<83? Then the span at t1 is [h, tau] = [48,83]. Then at T, it becomes [48 - 36*(T-84), 83 - 36*(T-84)]. But note: if 48<83, then the car is from 48 to 83? Then as it moves left, both endpoints decrease.\n\nHowever, the collision condition: at turn T, we are on freeway y (if our y-coordinate at that turn is y) and we require that 0 is in the span of the car on that freeway? Actually, the condition says: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T\".\n\nBut note: the player is at (0, y_T) at turn T, so the x-coordinate is always 0. Therefore, we are checking if the car's span at time T covers x=0.\n\nTherefore, for each freeway and each car on that freeway, we can compute the time intervals (if any) when the car covers x=0.\n\nWe are at turn 84. We start at y=0. We must avoid being on a freeway y (1..8) at a turn T when there is a car on that freeway whose span at T includes 0.\n\nOur actions: at each turn we choose U, D, or S. We cannot go below 0 or above 9.\n\nGoal: minimal H (number of turns) to reach y=9.\n\nWe can model this as a state space: (time, y). Time starts at t1=84 and we consider future turns. The state is (t, y) meaning at turn t we are at y.\n\nWe want to go from (84,0) to some (84+H-1, 9) with minimal H.\n\nConstraints: \n- For each state (t, y): if y is between 1 and 8, then we must not have a car on freeway y that has 0 in its span at time t.\n\nHow to check for a given freeway y and time t, whether there is a car on y that covers 0 at time t?\n\nWe are given the cars at time t1=84. For each car, we can compute the span at time t.\n\nLet dt = t - 84.\n\nFor a right-moving car: (tau, h) at time 84. At time t, the span is [tau + s*dt, h + s*dt]. We need to check if 0 is in [tau + s*dt, h + s*dt]. Since tau <= h, we require:\n   tau + s*dt <= 0 <= h + s*dt.\n\nSimilarly, for a left-moving car: (h, tau) at time 84? Actually, the input gives (head, tail) for left-moving? But the update rule uses [h, tau] and then becomes [h - s*dt, tau - s*dt]. And note: in the update rule, for left-moving the initial span is [h, tau]. However, the example input for left-moving: (48,83,left,36) — here 48 is head and 83 is tail? But then the car is from 48 to 83? That seems backwards because if it's moving left, the head should be the front? Actually, the update rule does not specify which is front, but the span is an interval. So we must have that the head and tail are such that the car covers an interval. In fact, the representation might be arbitrary? But note the update: for left-moving, the entire car moves left by s per turn. So the condition for covering 0 is:\n   min(h, tau) - s*dt <= 0 <= max(h, tau) - s*dt? \nBut wait: the update is [h - s*dt, tau - s*dt]. This interval might not be in increasing order. Actually, we should consider the interval as [min, max] of the two endpoints? But the update rule doesn't say that. It just gives the two endpoints. Then the condition is that 0 is between the two endpoints (inclusive) regardless of order? \n\nHowever, the collision condition is defined as \"0 ∈ Span(T)\", which is a set. So if the span is [a,b] with a<=b, then we require a<=0<=b. But if the car is given as (h, tau) for left-moving, and we update to [h - s*dt, tau - s*dt], then we must consider the interval from min(h-s*dt, tau-s*dt) to max(h-s*dt, tau-s*dt). Similarly for right-moving: [tau+s*dt, h+s*dt] becomes [min(tau+s*dt, h+s*dt), max(tau+s*dt, h+s*dt)].\n\nBut note: in the input for right-moving, we have (head, tail) but the update rule uses [tau, h]. How do we know which is tau and which is h? \n\nLooking at the input representation: \n  For freeway 1: (-48, -59, right, 4) — so head=-48, tail=-59. Then the update rule for right-moving uses [tau, h] = [-59, -48]. Then at time t, the car is at [ -59 + 4*(t-84), -48 + 4*(t-84) ].\n\nSimilarly, for a left-moving car: (48,83,left,36) — head=48, tail=83. Then the update rule for left-moving uses [h, tau] = [48,83] and becomes [48 - 36*(t-84), 83 - 36*(t-84)]. But note: 48 < 83, so the car at time 84 is from 48 to 83. Then at time t, it is from 48-36*(t-84) to 83-36*(t-84). Since 48-36*(t-84) < 83-36*(t-84), the interval is [48-36*dt, 83-36*dt] and we require 0 to be in that interval.\n\nHowever, what if the car is given in reverse? For example, a left-moving car with head=83 and tail=48? The update rule doesn't specify order. But the update rule is defined as [h - s*dt, tau - s*dt]. So the two endpoints are h-s*dt and tau-s*dt. Then the span is the set of x such that x is between min(h-s*dt, tau-s*dt) and max(h-s*dt, tau-s*dt). Similarly for right-moving.\n\nTherefore, for any car, we can compute the two endpoints at time t, and then check if 0 is between the min and max of these two.\n\nBut note: the representation in the input for a car is (head, tail, direction, speed). We don't know if head and tail are in order. But the update rule uses head and tail as given.\n\nSo for a car at time t (with dt=t-84):\n   if direction is 'right': \n        endpoint1 = tau + s * dt   [where tau is the tail given in the input]\n        endpoint2 = head + s * dt   [head given in the input]\n        the span is from min(endpoint1, endpoint2) to max(endpoint1, endpoint2)\n\n   if direction is 'left':\n        endpoint1 = head - s * dt\n        endpoint2 = tail - s * dt\n        the span is from min(endpoint1, endpoint2) to max(endpoint1, endpoint2)\n\nThen 0 is in the span if:\n   min(endpoint1, endpoint2) <= 0 <= max(endpoint1, endpoint2)\n\nNow, we have multiple cars per freeway. If at least one car on the freeway covers 0 at time t, then being on that freeway at time t causes a collision.\n\nWe are at y=0 at time 84. We want to move to y=9.\n\nNote: y=0 and y=9 are safe because there are no cars (freeways are from 1 to 8).\n\nWe can plan the moves. The minimal number of turns is at least 9 (if we go up every turn). But we might have to wait (use S) to avoid collisions.\n\nWe need to simulate the future car positions.\n\nLet me list the cars per freeway and compute the time intervals when they cover 0.\n\nWe'll compute for each freeway k (1 to 8) the set of times t (>=84) for which there is a car on freeway k that covers 0 at time t. Then, when we are at (t, k) (for k=1..8) we must avoid if t is in the \"bad\" set for freeway k.\n\nBut note: a freeway may have multiple cars, so the bad set is the union of the bad intervals of all cars on that freeway.\n\nLet dt = t - 84.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (-48, -59, right, 4)\n   endpoints: \n        endpoint1 = tau + s*dt = -59 + 4*dt\n        endpoint2 = head + s*dt = -48 + 4*dt\n   So the interval: [min(-59+4*dt, -48+4*dt), max(...)] = [-59+4*dt, -48+4*dt] because -59+4*dt < -48+4*dt.\n   Condition: \n        -59+4*dt <= 0 <= -48+4*dt\n   Solve:\n        -59+4*dt <= 0 -> 4*dt <= 59 -> dt <= 59/4 = 14.75 -> dt <= 14 (since integer)\n        0 <= -48+4*dt -> 4*dt >= 48 -> dt >= 12.\n\n   So for dt in [12,14] (i.e., turns 84+12=96 to 84+14=98) the car covers 0.\n\n   Therefore, freeway 1 is unsafe at turns 96,97,98.\n\nFreeway 2: same as freeway 1: (-48, -59, right, 4) -> same unsafe turns: 96,97,98.\n\nFreeway 3: two cars:\n   Car1: (48,37,right,4) -> but wait, head=48, tail=37? Then:\n        endpoint1 = 37 + 4*dt\n        endpoint2 = 48 + 4*dt\n        interval: [37+4*dt, 48+4*dt]\n        Condition: 37+4*dt <= 0 <= 48+4*dt -> \n          37+4*dt<=0 -> 4*dt<=-37 -> impossible? \n        So this car never covers 0.\n\n   Car2: (0,-11,right,4)\n        endpoint1 = -11 + 4*dt\n        endpoint2 = 0 + 4*dt = 4*dt\n        interval: [-11+4*dt, 4*dt]   (since -11+4*dt < 4*dt)\n        Condition: -11+4*dt <= 0 <= 4*dt\n          From 0 <= 4*dt -> dt>=0 (always true for t>=84)\n          From -11+4*dt<=0 -> 4*dt<=11 -> dt<=2.75 -> dt<=2 -> t<=86.\n\n        So this car covers 0 for dt=0,1,2 -> turns 84,85,86.\n\n   Therefore, freeway 3 is unsafe at turns 84,85,86.\n\nFreeway 4: same as freeway 3? \n   Cars: (48,37,right,4) -> never covers 0.\n          (0,-11,right,4) -> covers 0 at turns 84,85,86.\n\n   So unsafe at 84,85,86.\n\nFreeway 5: same as freeway 3 and 4: unsafe at 84,85,86.\n\nFreeway 6: one car: (48,83,left,36)\n   endpoints: \n        endpoint1 = 48 - 36*dt\n        endpoint2 = 83 - 36*dt\n        interval: [48-36*dt, 83-36*dt]   (since 48-36*dt < 83-36*dt for all dt)\n        Condition: 48-36*dt <= 0 <= 83-36*dt\n\n        First: 0 <= 83-36*dt -> 36*dt <= 83 -> dt <= 83/36 ~ 2.305 -> dt<=2 -> t<=86.\n        Second: 48-36*dt <=0 -> 36*dt>=48 -> dt>=48/36=4/3 ~1.333 -> so dt>=2 (since dt integer) -> so dt=2.\n\n        Check dt=2: \n            interval: [48-72, 83-72] = [-24, 11] -> 0 is in [-24,11] -> yes.\n        dt=1: \n            [48-36, 83-36] = [12,47] -> 0 not in [12,47] -> not covered.\n        dt=0: [48,83] -> 0 not in.\n\n        So only at dt=2 (turn 86) the car covers 0.\n\n        Therefore, freeway 6 is unsafe only at turn 86.\n\nFreeway 7: three cars:\n   Car1: (48,37,right,4) -> same as before: never covers 0.\n   Car2: (12,1,right,4) -> \n        endpoints: 1+4*dt, 12+4*dt -> interval [1+4*dt, 12+4*dt]\n        Condition: 1+4*dt<=0<=12+4*dt -> \n          1+4*dt<=0 -> 4*dt<=-1 -> impossible.\n\n   Car3: (-24,-35,right,4) -> \n        endpoints: -35+4*dt, -24+4*dt -> interval [-35+4*dt, -24+4*dt]\n        Condition: -35+4*dt<=0<=-24+4*dt\n            -35+4*dt<=0 -> 4*dt<=35 -> dt<=8.75 -> dt<=8\n            0<=-24+4*dt -> 4*dt>=24 -> dt>=6.\n\n        So for dt in [6,8] -> turns 90,91,92.\n\n   Therefore, freeway 7 is unsafe at turns 90,91,92.\n\nFreeway 8: same as freeway 1 and 2: (-48,-59,right,4) -> unsafe at turns 96,97,98.\n\nSummary of unsafe freeways by turn:\n\nWe are going to simulate from turn 84 onward. We need to avoid:\n\nFreeway 3,4,5: unsafe at 84,85,86.\nFreeway 6: unsafe at 86.\nFreeway 7: unsafe at 90,91,92.\nFreeway 1,2,8: unsafe at 96,97,98.\n\nNote: freeway 6 is unsafe only at 86, but freeway 3,4,5 are unsafe at 84,85,86. So at turn 86, freeways 3,4,5,6 are unsafe.\n\nOur plan: we start at y=0 at turn 84.\n\nWe must avoid being on freeways 1-8 at the unsafe times for that freeway.\n\nWe want to go from y=0 to y=9 as fast as possible.\n\nThe minimal moves: 9 moves up. So H=9: we would be at y=9 at turn 84+8 = 92? Let me see:\n\nAt turn 84: start at 0.\nAfter 1st action (turn84): move to y1.\nAt turn 85: at y1.\n...\nAt turn 84+t: at y_t.\n\nWe do H-1 actions? Actually, the sequence is for t=0 to H-1: so we do H actions? But then we have H+1 states? \n\nClarification: \n  We start at turn t1=84: position (0,0).\n  Then we do action a_{84} -> at turn 85 we are at y1 = 0 + delta(a_{84}).\n  ... \n  After H actions (from turn84 to turn84+H-1) we have the last action at turn84+H-1, and then at turn84+H we are at the new position. But the problem says: we want y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nWait: the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning t=0 to H-1: so we do H actions? Then the state after H actions is at time t1+H.\n\nBut the goal is: y_{t1+H-1} = 9? \n\nActually, note: \n  At turn t1 (84) we are at y_{84}=0.\n  After action a_{84} (at t1+0) we get y_{85}.\n  ... \n  After action a_{84+H-1} we get y_{84+H}.\n\nBut the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\" — that would be y_{84+H-1}=9.\n\nSo the last action is taken at turn t1+H-1? Then the state at turn t1+H-1 is (0,9). And we do H actions? Actually, the sequence has H actions: from t1 to t1+H-1? Then we have H actions and H+1 states? \n\nBut note: the state at the beginning of turn t1 is given. Then we do an action at turn t1, then at turn t1+1 we have a new state. Then at turn t1+1 we do the next action, etc.\n\nThe state at turn t is after the action of turn t-1? \n\nActually, the player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, meaning that at turn t, we are at y_t, then we choose a_t, and then at turn t+1 we are at y_{t+1}.\n\nTherefore, at turn 84: we are at y84=0. Then we choose a84. Then at turn 85: y85 = y84 + Δy84.\n\nWe want to be at y_{84+H-1} = 9. \n\nBut note: at the turn we are at y=9, we don't need to move further. So the last action we take is at turn 84+H-2? Then at turn 84+H-1 we are at 9.\n\nAlternatively, we do H actions? Then we are at state at turn 84+H. But the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\", meaning turn 84+H-1.\n\nTherefore, we are to be at y_{84+H-1}=9. \n\nHow many actions? From turn84 to turn84+H-1: that is H actions? But then the state at turn84 is initial, and then we do H actions: a84, a85, ..., a_{84+H-1}. Then the state at turn85 is after the first action, and at turn84+H is after the last action. But we want the state at turn84+H-1 to be 9? \n\nWait, the state at turn84+H-1: that is the state after we have taken H-1 actions? \n\nLet me index:\n  Turn84: state0 = 0.\n  Action a84: then state1 at turn85 = state0 + Δa84.\n  ...\n  After k actions, we are at state_k at turn84+k.\n\nWe want state_{H-1} at turn84+(H-1) to be 9.\n\nSo the number of actions is H-1? \n\nBut the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\" and a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}. So the sequence has H actions? Then we have:\n\n  t = 0: action at t1+0 = 84 -> state at turn85\n  t = 1: action at 85 -> state at 86\n  ...\n  t = H-1: action at t1+H-1 -> state at t1+H\n\nBut we want the state at turn t1+H-1 to be 9. \n\nThis implies that after H-1 actions (the last action being at turn t1+H-2) we are at state at turn t1+H-1 = 9. Then we don't need to take an action at turn t1+H-1? \n\nBut the sequence is defined for t=0 to H-1: that is H actions. Then the last action is at turn t1+H-1, which would lead to state at turn t1+H. \n\nThis is confusing. \n\nLooking back at the problem: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\".\n\nAnd note: the player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nWe start at turn t1: y_{t1} = 0.\n\nWe want to have at some future turn T: y_T = 9. The minimal H such that T = t1+H-1? \n\nBut the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\".\n\nSo we want y_{t1+H-1} = 9.\n\nHow do we achieve that? \n  We start at turn t1: y_{t1}=0.\n  Then we take an action at turn t1: a_{t1} -> this gives y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + Δa_{t1}.\n  Then we take a_{t1+1} -> y_{t1+2} = y_{t1+1} + Δa_{t1+1}.\n  ...\n  We take H-1 actions: a_{t1}, a_{t1+1}, ..., a_{t1+H-2} to get y_{t1+H-1} = 9.\n\nBut the problem says the sequence is {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}: which would be a_{t1} to a_{t1+H-1} (H actions). Then the last action a_{t1+H-1} would lead to y_{t1+H} = y_{t1+H-1} + Δa_{t1+H-1}. But we don't require anything about y_{t1+H}.\n\nThis seems inconsistent.\n\nRe-read the problem: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and then \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\".\n\nBut with H actions (from t1 to t1+H-1) we are affecting states from t1+1 to t1+H. So the state at turn t1+H-1 is the state after the first H-1 actions? \n\nActually, after k actions, we are at state at turn t1+k.\n\nWe want the state at turn t1+H-1 to be 9. That means we take H-1 actions: from a_{t1} to a_{t1+H-2}. Then the sequence should be of length H-1? But the problem says the sequence has H actions.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might mean that we take actions at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1, and then the state at turn t1+H-1 is the state after the action taken at turn t1+H-2? \n\nThis is messy.\n\nLet me look at the answer format: \n  Turn t1: a_{t1}\n  Turn t1+1: a_{t1+1}\n  ...\n  up to ... \n\nAnd then we stop when we have reached 9 at the turn after the last action? \n\nBut the problem says: at turn t1+H-1 we are at (0,9). \n\nHow many actions are taken by turn t1+H-1? \n  The last action taken before turn t1+H-1 is at turn t1+H-2? So we have taken H-1 actions? \n\nBut the sequence is indexed t=0 to H-1: that is H actions. \n\nI think there is a discrepancy. \n\nAlternatively, the problem might be using H as the number of turns including the starting turn? \n\nAt turn t1 (turn0) we are at 0. Then we do H-1 actions to get to turn H-1 (which is turn t1+H-1) at 9. Then the number of actions is H-1, but the problem says the sequence has H actions? \n\nI see the problem: \"minimal number of turns H\" and then the sequence has H actions. \n\nBut note: the player update happens at the end of the turn? \n\nPerhaps the problem considers a \"turn\" as the time when we take an action and then the state updates. \n\nAt the current turn t1=84, we are at (0,0). Then we take an action a84, and then the state updates to the next state at the next turn (85). \n\nWe want to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1. \n\nSo we are to simulate: \n  At turn84: start at 0, then take action a84 -> then at turn85: y85 = 0 + Δa84.\n  At turn85: take action a85 -> then at turn86: y86 = y85 + Δa85.\n  ...\n  We want at turn84+H-1: y_{84+H-1} = 9.\n\nHow many actions? We take actions at turn84, 85, ..., 84+H-2? That is H-1 actions? But the problem says the sequence is for t=0 to H-1, which is H actions.\n\nThis would then update to state at turn84+H. \n\nUnless the problem means that we take actions at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1, and then the state at turn t1+H-1 is the state BEFORE the action at turn t1+H-1? But that doesn't make sense because the action at turn t1+H-1 would then change it.\n\nI think the only logical way is:\n\nThe state at the beginning of turn t1 is (0,0).\nWe then take an action a_{t1} and then the state updates and we are at the beginning of turn t1+1 at y_{t1+1}.\nWe want at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 to be at (0,9).\n\nThen the actions we take are at turns: t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-2? That is H-1 actions.\n\nBut the problem says: \"sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" which would be H actions: t1, t1+1, ... t1+H-1. \n\nThen the last action (at turn t1+H-1) would update the state to turn t1+H+1? No, to turn t1+H.\n\nThen the state at turn t1+H-1 would be the state before taking the action a_{t1+H-1}. \n\nBut then we are not at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1? \n\nI think the problem has a off-by-one.\n\nLooking at the problem statement: \"y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\", and \"current turn is t1\", and we start at (0, y_{t1}) = (0,0).\n\nWe want to reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1.\n\nBy the update rule, y_{t1+H-1} = y_{t1+H-2} + Δy_{t1+H-2}.\n\nSo to have y_{t1+H-1}=9, we need to have taken an action at turn t1+H-2 that gets us to 9 from the previous state.\n\nTherefore, the last action is at turn t1+H-2, and the sequence of actions is from t1 to t1+H-2, which is H-1 actions.\n\nBut the problem says the sequence is for t=0 to H-1, meaning H actions.\n\nThis is not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the minimal number of turns H might be the number of turns that pass, including the starting turn? For example, if we do nothing (H=1), then at turn84 we are at 0, but we want 9? That doesn't work.\n\nIf we do one action: a84, then at turn85 we are at 1. Then if we want to be at 9 at turn84+H-1, then if H=10, then turn84+9=93: we want to be at 9 at turn93.\n\nBut then we would have taken 10 actions? (from turn84 to turn93-1=92? or to turn93-1=92) -> 9 actions.\n\nI think there is a mistake in the problem statement.\n\nLet me assume that we take actions for turns t1 to t1+H-1, and then the state at turn t1+H is the state after the last action. We want that state to be at 9. Then the turn we are at 9 is turn t1+H, and the number of actions is H. The minimal H such that we can reach 9 at turn t1+H.\n\nBut the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\".\n\nHowever, in the example, the current turn is t1=84, so turn t1+H-1 = 84+H-1. We want to be at 9 at that turn.\n\nGiven the confusion, I will assume that the intended meaning is: \n  We start at turn84: y84=0.\n  We take actions a84, a85, ..., a_{84+H-2} (H-1 actions) to get y_{84+H-1}=9.\n\nBut then the sequence should be for t=0 to H-2, but the problem says to H-1.\n\nAlternatively, the minimal number of turns H is the number of turns from the start until we reach 9, so we start at turn84 and we want to be at turn T=84+H-1. Then the number of turns that have passed is (84+H-1 - 84) = H-1 turns after the start. And we have taken H-1 actions.\n\nBut the problem asks for a sequence of H actions.\n\nI think the safest is to assume that the sequence of actions has to be provided for turns t1 to t1+H-1, and that after these H actions, at turn t1+H, we are at y=9. But the problem says turn t1+H-1.\n\nHowever, in the problem statement: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\", and then the actions are for turns t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nThis would mean that after taking the action at turn t1+H-1, we are at the next turn (t1+H) and then the state at turn t1+H-1 is the state before that action? \n\nThis is very confusing.\n\nAnother possibility: the turn number is the same as the action number. We are at state s0 at the beginning. Then at turn1 we take action a1 and go to s1. Turn2: a2 to s2, etc.\n\nWe start at turn84 at s0=0.\nThen at turn84 we take a84 and go to s1 at the next state (which is for turn85?).\n\nBut the problem says: at turn84, the state is (0,0). Then we take action a84, and then the state updates and we are at turn85.\n\nWe want to be at (0,9) at turn84+H-1.\n\nThat means after we have taken H-1 actions (at turns84,85,...,84+H-2), we are at state at turn84+H-1 = 9.\n\nTherefore, the sequence of actions is for turns84 to 84+H-2: that's H-1 actions.\n\nBut the problem says the sequence is indexed from t=0 to H-1: which would be H actions.\n\nThis indicates that the problem likely means that we take H actions and then are at state at turn84+H = 9. But then the turn we reach is 84+H, not 84+H-1.\n\nGiven the time, I will assume that the problem has a off-by-one and that the intended meaning is that we want to be at 9 at turn t1+H, after taking H actions from turn t1 to turn t1+H-1.\n\nThis is a common interpretation.\n\nThen the minimal H is the number of actions, and the state after action H is at turn t1+H.\n\nBut the problem says: \" at turn t1+H-1\".\n\n However, in the answer format, they might not be strict about the turn number as long as the actions are provided and the state is reached at the correct time.\n\n To resolve, let's try to see what is the earliest turn we can reach 9.\n\n We start at turn84 at y=0.\n We can move up to 9 in 9 moves: then we would be at turn84+9 = 93 at y=9.\n\n So if we take 9 actions (U every turn) from turn84 to turn92, then at turn93 we are at 9.\n\n But the problem says we want to be at turn84+H-1 = 9. So if H=10, then turn84+9=93. Then we want to be at 9 at turn93, which matches.\n\n And the sequence has H=10 actions: from turn84 to turn93-1= turn92.\n\n Therefore, the minimal H is 10.\n\n But is that minimal? We can also move faster? We can only move one per turn.\n\n But what about waiting? We might have to wait because of the cars.\n\n Let me try to simulate with 9 actions (so we would be at turn93 after 9 actions, but we want to be at turn84+9-1=93? for H=9: then turn84+8=92. So if we move up 9 times, we would be at 9 at turn84+9=93, not at 92.\n\n So we cannot reach in 9 actions if we want to be at 9 at turn92.\n\n Therefore, we must have at least 9 actions, but then we are at 9 at turn93. So if we set H=10, then we want to be at turn84+10-1=93, and that matches.\n\n So with H=10, we can do 9 U's and one S? But we need to avoid collisions.\n\n Alternatively, we might be able to do it in 9 actions if we start at turn84 and after 9 actions we are at 9 at turn93, and then we set H=10 so that turn84+10-1=93 is when we are at 9.\n\n This is messy.\n\n Given the time, I will assume that the intended meaning is: \n   We want to be at y=9 at turn T = t1 + H - 1.\n   We start at turn84: y84=0.\n   We take actions at turns84,85,..., T-1 = t1+H-2, and then the state at turn T is 9.\n\n   Therefore, the number of actions is (T - 84) = (t1+H-1 - t1) = H-1.\n\n   But the sequence is from t=0 to H-1: that would be H actions.\n\n This doesn't add up.\n\n I think there might be a typo in the problem. I will assume that we are to be at (0,9) at turn84+H, after taking H actions (from turn84 to turn84+H-1).\n\n Then the minimal H is 9 if we can move up continuously.\n\n But we must avoid the unsafe freeways.\n\n Let's simulate moving up every turn:\n\n   Turn84: start at y=0 (safe, because not on freeway 1-8)\n   Action: U\n   Turn85: y=1 -> freeway1? But freeway1 is not unsafe at 85? \n        Freeway1 unsafe at 96,97,98 -> so safe.\n        But freeway3,4,5 are unsafe at 84,85,86 -> and we are on freeway1? No, freeway1 is y=1.\n\n        We are at y=1 at turn85.\n        Freeway1 is safe at turn85? Yes, because unsafe only at 96,97,98.\n\n        But freeway1 has a car that is not covering 0 at turn85.\n\n        However, are there other freeways? We are on freeway1.\n\n        So we only care about freeway1 at turn85: which is safe.\n\n   Turn85: at y=1 -> safe.\n   Action: U\n   Turn86: y=2 -> freeway2. \n        Freeway2: unsafe at 96,97,98 -> safe.\n        But freeway2 has the same car as freeway1: (-48,-59,right,4) -> at turn86: \n            dt=2: span = [-59+8, -48+8] = [-51,-40] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\n   Turn86: safe.\n   Action: U\n   Turn87: y=3 -> freeway3.\n        Freeway3: unsafe at 84,85,86 -> turn87 is 87>86 -> safe? \n        But let me check the cars on freeway3:\n            Car1: (48,37,right,4): at dt=3: [37+12,48+12]=[49,60] -> no.\n            Car2: (0,-11,right,4): at dt=3: [-11+12,0+12]=[1,12] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\n        So safe.\n\n   Turn87: safe.\n   Action: U\n   Turn88: y=4 -> freeway4.\n        Freeway4: same as freeway3 at turn88: \n            Car1: [37+4*4,48+4*4]=[37+16,48+16]=[53,64] -> no.\n            Car2: [-11+16,0+16]=[5,16] -> no.\n        safe.\n\n   Action: U\n   Turn89: y=5 -> freeway5.\n        Similarly, at dt=5: \n            Car1: [37+20,48+20]=[57,68] -> no.\n            Car2: [-11+20,0+20]=[9,20] -> no.\n        safe.\n\n   Action: U\n   Turn90: y=6 -> freeway6.\n        Freeway6: unsafe only at turn86. At turn90: \n            Car: (48,83,left,36): dt=6: [48-216,83-216]=[-168,-133] -> no.\n        safe.\n\n   Action: U\n   Turn91: y=7 -> freeway7.\n        Freeway7: unsafe at 90,91,92.\n        At turn91: dt=7.\n        Check car3: (-24,-35,right,4): \n            [-35+4*7, -24+4*7] = [-35+28, -24+28] = [-7,4] -> 0 is in [-7,4] -> unsafe!\n\n        So we cannot be on freeway7 at turn91.\n\n Therefore, we cannot use the direct path at turn91 for y=7.\n\n We must avoid being on freeway7 at turns90,91,92.\n\n How to avoid? We might wait at a safe spot.\n\n Possibilities:\n\n  Option1: at turn90, instead of moving to y=7, we wait at y=6 or move down to y=5 or wait at y=6? \n  But at turn90, if we are at y=6, we are safe (freeway6 is safe at turn90: as above, car is at [-168,-133]).\n  Then at turn91, if we are still at y=6, is freeway6 safe? \n        At turn91: dt=7 for freeway6 car: [48-36*7, 83-36*7] = [48-252, 83-252] = [-204, -169] -> safe.\n\n  But then at turn91 we are at y=6, and we want to move up. \n  Then at turn92: we move to y=7. \n        Freeway7 at turn92: dt=8 -> car3: [-35+32, -24+32] = [-3,8] -> 0 in [-3,8] -> unsafe.\n\n  So turn92 is also unsafe for freeway7.\n\n  Then at turn93: freeway7: car3: [-35+36, -24+36] = [1,12] -> safe.\n\n  So if we wait at y=6 at turn90 and turn91, then at turn92 we move to y=7 -> unsafe? \n  Alternatively, at turn91 we move to y=7? -> unsafe.\n\n  How about waiting until turn93 to move to y=7? \n\n  Plan:\n\n      turn84:0 -> U to 1\n      turn85:1 -> U to 2\n      turn86:2 -> U to 3\n      turn87:3 -> U to 4\n      turn88:4 -> U to 5\n      turn89:5 -> U to 6  (at turn90, we are at 6)\n      turn90:6 -> S (stay) -> still at 6 at turn91\n      turn91:6 -> S (stay) -> still at 6 at turn92\n      turn92:6 -> U to 7 at turn93.\n             turn93: y=7. \n             freeway7 at turn93: dt=9 -> car3: [-35+36, -24+36] = [1,12] -> safe.\n      turn93:7 -> U to 8 at turn94.\n             freeway8 at turn94: dt=10 -> car: [-59+40, -48+40] = [-19,-8] -> safe.\n      turn94:8 -> U to 9 at turn95.\n\n  Then we are at 9 at turn95.\n\n  How many actions? \n        from turn84 to turn94: actions at 84,85,86,87,88,89,90,91,92,93,94? \n        But we want to be at 9 at turn95. \n        Actions: 84:U,85:U,86:U,87:U,88:U,89:U,90:S,91:S,92:U,93:U,94:U -> 11 actions.\n\n  Then H=11, and we would be at turn84+H-1 = 84+11-1=94, but we are at 9 at turn95? -> not matching.\n\n  Alternatively, if we consider that we take 11 actions, then the state after the last action is at turn84+11=95. So if we set H=11, then the turn we are at 9 is 95, and the problem wants turn84+H-1=84+10=94? -> no.\n\n  If we set H=12, then turn84+12-1=95, and then we want to be at 9 at turn95. This matches.\n\n  But then we have 12 actions? But we only have 11 actions in the above plan.\n\n  We need to output a sequence of 12 actions.\n\n  We can add an extra action at the end? But then we would go above 9.\n\n  Let me recount the turns:\n\n      turn84: start at 0.\n      a84: U -> turn85:1\n      a85: U -> turn86:2\n      a86: U -> turn87:3\n      a87: U -> turn88:4\n      a88: U -> turn89:5\n      a89: U -> turn90:6\n      a90: S -> turn91:6\n      a91: S -> turn92:6\n      a92: U -> turn93:7\n      a93: U -> turn94:8\n      a94: U -> turn95:9\n\n  So actions from turn84 to turn94: 11 actions.\n\n  Then to be at turn95=84+11, we set H=12 because 84+12-1=95.\n\n  So the sequence has H=12 actions? But we only have 11. We need one more action at turn95? But then at turn96 we would be at 9 or 10, and we want to be at 9 at turn95.\n\n  We can do an action at turn95: but we are already at 9. We can do S. Then we are still at 9 at turn96.\n\n  But then we are at 9 at turn96, not turn95.\n\n  Alternatively, we can do fewer actions? \n\n  We have to reach 9. The minimal number of U actions is 9. We used 9 U's and 2 S's, total 11 actions.\n\n  Therefore, minimal actions is 11, and then we are at 9 at turn95.\n\n  So if the problem wants us to be at turn84+H-1=95, then H=12.\n\n  The sequence will have 12 actions: the 11 actions above and then one more action (S at turn95) to keep at 9? But that would be at turn96.\n\n  Or we can output the 11 actions and then for turn95 we don't do anything? But the sequence must have H=12 actions.\n\n  This indicates my assumption might be wrong.\n\n  Let me try a different approach.\n\n  We want to be at 9 at turn84+H-1.\n  We start at turn84 at 0.\n\n  The earliest we can be at 9 is turn84+9 = 93, if we move up every turn.\n\n  So H-1 = 9 -> H=10.\n\n  But in the direct path, at turn91 (which is 84+7=91) we would be at y=7 and it is unsafe.\n\n  So we need to delay.\n\n  How about if we start by waiting at y=0 for a few turns? \n  But y=0 is safe.\n\n  We can wait at y=0 for two turns: \n        turn84: S -> turn85:0\n        turn85: S -> turn86:0\n\n  Then at turn86: y=0.\n\n  Then we start moving up:\n\n        turn86: U -> turn87:1\n        turn87: U -> turn88:2\n        turn88: U -> turn89:3\n        turn89: U -> turn90:4\n        turn90: U -> turn91:5\n        turn91: U -> turn92:6\n        turn92: U -> turn93:7\n        turn93: U -> turn94:8\n        turn94: U -> turn95:9\n\n  Now check safety:\n\n        turn87: y=1 -> freeway1: safe (unsafe only at 96-98)\n        turn88: y=2 -> freeway2: safe\n        turn89: y=3 -> freeway3: at turn89: \n                car1: [37+4*(89-84)=37+20=57, 48+20=68] -> no.\n                car2: [-11+20=9, 0+20=20] -> 0 not in [9,20] -> safe.\n        turn90: y=4 -> freeway4: same as above: safe.\n        turn91: y=5 -> freeway5: same: safe.\n        turn92: y=6 -> freeway6: at turn92: \n                [48-36*(92-84), 83-36*8] = [48-288, 83-288] = [-240, -205] -> safe.\n        turn93: y=7 -> freeway7: at turn93: \n                car3: [-35+4*(93-84), -24+4*9] = [-35+36, -24+36] = [1,12] -> safe.\n        turn94: y=8 -> freeway8: at turn94: \n                [-59+4*10, -48+40] = [-19, -8] -> safe.\n\n  So we are safe.\n\n  How many actions? \n        actions: turn84: S, turn85: S, turn86:U, turn87:U, turn88:U, turn89:U, turn90:U, turn91:U, turn92:U, turn93:U, turn94:U -> 11 actions.\n\n  We are at turn95: y=9.\n\n  We want to be at turn84+H-1 = 9.\n\n  So 84+H-1 = 95 -> H-1 = 11 -> H=12.\n\n  Therefore, the sequence has 12 actions? But we have 11 actions above.\n\n  We need to output 12 actions. We can add one more action at the end, but then we would be at turn96.\n\n  Or we can wait an extra turn somewhere.\n\n  How about wait at turn84,85,86: three waits? \n        actions: turn84:S, turn85:S, turn86:S, then turn87:U, ... until turn95:U (9 U's) -> then at turn96:9.\n        Then to be at turn96=84+H-1, so 84+H-1=96 -> H=13.\n\n  That is not better.\n\n  Alternatively, we can output the 11 actions and then at turn95 we do S (even though we are at 9) -> then we are at 9 at turn96.\n  Then we set H=12, and we are at turn84+12-1=95+12-1 wait, 84+11=95? -> not.\n\n  If we do 12 actions, then the state after 12 actions is at turn84+12=96.\n  We want to be at 9 at turn84+H-1=84+12-1=95 -> not matching.\n\n  I see the issue: in the above plan, we took 11 actions and reached 9 at turn95.\n  The turn95 is the state after the 11th action (action at turn94).\n\n  So if we let the sequence be these 11 actions, then the state at turn84+11-1=84+10=94 is the state after the 10th action, which is 8, not 9.\n\n  then the state at turn95 (after the 11th action) is 9, which is turn84+11.\n\n  Therefore, to have the state at turn84+H-1=95, we need H-1 = 11 -> H=12.\n\n  But the sequence of actions is for turns84 to turn84+11 (H=12 actions), but we only have 11 actions in the plan.\n\n  We can add a dummy action at turn95? But turn95 is after we've reached 9.\n\n  The only solution is to take 12 actions and have the state at turn95=9.\n\n  We can do: \n        turn84: S\n        turn85: S\n        turn86: U\n        turn87: U\n        turn88: U\n        turn89: U\n        turn90: U\n        turn91: U\n        turn92: U\n        turn93: U  -> at turn94: 8\n        turn94: S  -> state at turn95: 8 (waiting at 8)\n        turn95: U  -> state at turn96: 9\n\n  Then we are at 9 at turn96.\n\n  Or we can do at turn94: U -> state at turn95:9, which is what we want.\n\n  So the plan with 11 actions: but then the last action is at turn94, and we are at 9 at turn95.\n\n  Therefore, the sequence of actions is from turn84 to turn94 (11 actions), and then we are at turn95=9.\n\n  So the number of actions is 11, and we want to be at turn84+H-1=95 -> so 84+H-1=95 -> H=12.\n\n  The sequence must have 12 actions? \n\n  This is the off-by-one.\n\n  Given the above, I will output the 11 actions for turns84 to turn94, and then for turn95 I will output an action that is not needed, but it won't change the state (S) and then we are still at 9 at turn96, but the problem only requires to reach 9 at turn95.\n\n  However, the problem might not require actions beyond the reach.\n\n  Alternatively, the problem might allow the sequence to be exactly the actions until we reach 9, and then we stop. But the format requires H actions.\n\n  Since the minimal number of actions is 11, and we must output 12 actions for H=12, we can output an extra 'S' at the end.\n\n  But then we are at 9 at turn95 and then at turn96 we are still at 9.\n\n  So the state at turn95 is 9, as desired.\n\n  Therefore, the sequence is 12 actions: the 11 actions as above plus one 'S' at the end.\n\n  However, the actions are for turns84 to turn84+11 = turn95.\n\n  Plan with 12 actions:\n\n      turn84: S  (0->0)\n      turn85: S  (0->0)\n      turn86: U  (0->1)\n      turn87: U  (1->2)\n      turn88: U  (2->3)\n      turn89: U  (3->4)\n      turn90: U  (4->5)\n      turn91: U  (5->6)\n      turn92: U  (6->7)\n      turn93: U  (7->8)\n      turn94: U  (8->9)   -> at turn95:9\n      turn95: S  (9->9)   -> at turn96:9\n\n  We are at 9 at turn95 and turn96.\n\n  But at turn94: we do U from 8 to 9, and then at turn95: we are at 9 and then we do S -> and then at turn96:9.\n\n  The state at turn95 is 9, so it meets the requirement.\n\n  Now check safety for the new actions:\n\n      turn92: we are at y=7 at turn93? Let me see the state at each turn:\n\n        turn84:0\n        turn85:0 (after action84:S)\n        turn86:0 (action85:S) -> then action86:U -> turn87:1\n        turn87:1 -> action87:U -> turn88:2\n        turn88:2 -> action88:U -> turn89:3\n        turn89:3 -> action89:U -> turn90:4\n        turn90:4 -> action90:U -> turn91:5\n        turn91:5 -> action91:U -> turn92:6\n        turn92:6 -> action92:U -> turn93:7\n        turn93:7 -> action93:U -> turn94:8\n        turn94:8 -> action94:U -> turn95:9\n        turn95:9 -> action95:S -> turn96:9\n\n  Now check freeway at each state:\n\n      turn85: y=0 (safe)\n      turn86: y=0 (safe)\n      turn87: y=1 -> freeway1: dt=3 (87-84=3): [-59+12, -48+12] = [-47,-36] -> safe.\n      turn88: y=2 -> freeway2: dt=4: [-59+16, -48+16] = [-43,-32] -> safe.\n      turn89: y=3 -> freeway3: dt=5: car1: [37+20,48+20]=[57,68] (safe), car2:[-11+20,0+20]=[9,20] (safe) -> safe.\n      turn90: y=4 -> freeway4: same as freeway3 at turn90: car2: [9,20] -> safe.\n      turn91: y=5 -> freeway5: same -> safe.\n      turn92: y=6 -> freeway6: dt=8: [48-36*8, 83-36*8]=[48-288,83-288]=[-240,-205] -> safe.\n      turn93: y=7 -> freeway7: dt=9: car3:[-35+36, -24+36]=[1,12] -> safe.\n      turn94: y=8 -> freeway8: dt=10: [-59+40, -48+40]=[-19,-8] -> safe.\n      turn95: y=9 -> safe (not a freeway)\n\n  So it is safe.\n\n  Therefore, the minimal H is 12.\n\n  The actions are:\n\n      turn84: S\n      turn85: S\n      turn86: U\n      turn87: U\n      turn88: U\n      turn89: U\n      turn90: U\n      turn91: U\n      turn92: U\n      turn93: U\n      turn94: U\n      turn95: S\n\n  But wait, we have 12 actions, and we are at 9 at turn95 (after the action at turn94 we are at 9 at turn95, and then the action at turn95 doesn't change it).\n\n  This meets the requirement.\n\n  However, is there a faster way? \n      We waited two turns at the beginning. \n      Could we wait only one turn? \n\n  Plan with one wait at the beginning:\n\n      turn84: S -> turn85:0\n      turn85: U -> turn86:1\n      turn86: U -> turn87:2\n      turn88:3\n      turn89:4\n      turn90:5\n      turn91:6  -> at turn91: y=6 (freeway6) -> safe (dt=7: [48-252,83-252] = [-204,-169])\n      turn92:7  -> at turn92: y=7 (freeway7) -> unsafe because car3: [-35+4*8, -24+32] = [-35+32, -24+32] = [-3,8] -> 0 in, so unsafe.\n\n  So not safe.\n\n  How about wait at the beginning and then one wait in the middle?\n\n      turn84: U -> turn85:1\n      turn85: U -> turn86:2\n      turn86: U -> turn87:3\n      turn87: U -> turn88:4\n      turn88: U -> turn89:5\n      turn89: S -> turn90:5   (wait at y=5)\n      turn90: U -> turn91:6   (at turn91: y=6 -> safe, as above)\n      turn91: U -> turn92:7   (at turn92: y=7 -> unsafe)\n\n  Alternatively, wait at turn90 at y=6:\n\n      turn84:U to1\n      ... \n      turn89:U to6 at turn90.\n      turn90: S -> turn91:6 (safe)\n      turn91: U -> turn92:7 (unsafe)\n\n  Then try to wait two turns in the middle:\n\n      turn89: we are at 5 at turn90.\n      turn90: S -> turn91:5\n      turn91: S -> turn92:5\n      turn92: U -> turn93:6\n      turn93: U -> turn94:7  -> at turn94: y=7, freeway7: dt=10: car3: [-35+40, -24+40] = [5,16] -> safe.\n      turn94: U -> turn95:8\n      turn95: U -> turn96:9\n\n  Then actions: 10 actions? (from turn84 to turn95: 12 actions? Let's count:\n\n      turn84:U\n      turn85:U\n      turn86:U\n      turn87:U\n      turn88:U\n      turn89:U  -> at turn90:6 actions so far, state at turn90:6\n      turn90:S\n      turn91:S\n      turn92:U\n      turn93:U\n      turn94:U  -> to7 at turn95? \n        actions: 84,85,86,87,88,89,90,91,92,93,94: 11 actions, and at turn95:7? \n        then turn95:U to8 at turn96\n        turn96:U to9 at turn97.\n\n  So 13 actions.\n\n  This is worse than the first plan with 12 actions.\n\n  Therefore, the first plan is better.\n\n  So the answer is 12 actions.\n\n  Sequence:\n\n      Turn 84: S\n      Turn 85: S\n      Turn 86: U\n      Turn 87: U\n      Turn 88: U\n      Turn 89: U\n      Turn 90: U\n      Turn 91: U\n      Turn 92: U\n      Turn 93: U\n      Turn 94: U\n      Turn 95: S\n\n  But note: the last action (Turn95: S) is taken after we are already at 9. We could also do 'S' at turn95 even though we are at 9.\n\n  This is acceptable.\n\n  However, is there a plan with 11 actions that reaches 9 at turn95? \n\n  We need to be at 9 at turn95, and we start at0 at turn84. The minimal moves is 9 ups, so we need at least 9 actions of U. The other actions can be S or D, but we cannot use D because we want to go up.\n\n  Total upward movement must be +9. With 11 actions, we would have 9 U's and 2 S's (or 9 U's and 2 D's, but D's would require extra U's).\n\n  So with 11 actions, we would have two S's.\n\n  The earliest we can be at 9 is turn84+11=95 (state after 11 actions). So we are at 9 at turn95, as desired.\n\n  But in our first simulation with 11 actions (without the extra S at the end) we had:\n\n        actions: \n          84: S\n          85: S\n          86: U\n          87: U\n          88: U\n          89: U\n          90: U\n          91: U\n          92: U\n          93: U\n          94: U   -> 11 actions, and at turn95:9.\n\n  This is 11 actions and we are at 9 at turn95.\n\n  But the problem says the sequence has H actions, and we are to be at turn84+H-1=95.\n\n  With H=12, we would be at turn84+12-1=95, and we have 12 actions.\n\n  But this plan has 11 actions, so if we set H=11, then turn84+11-1=94, and we want to be at 9 at turn94, but we are at9 at turn95.\n\n  So we need to set H=12 and have 12 actions.\n\n  Therefore, to have 12 actions, we add an extra S at the end.\n\n  It's a bit of a workaround, but it meets the requirement.\n\n  Alternatively, the problem might not require the last action to change the state, and we can output the 11 actions and then an extra S at the end to make 12 actions.\n\n  So I will output the 12 actions as above.\n\n  But note: in the 11-action plan, we are safe and we reach at turn95. The extra action at turn95 (S) doesn't cause any harm and we are still at 9 at turn96, but the requirement is to be at 9 at turn95, which we are.\n\n  Therefore, the answer is:\n\n      Turn 84: S\n      Turn 85: S\n      Turn 86: U\n      Turn 87: U\n      Turn 88: U\n      Turn 89: U\n      Turn 90: U\n      Turn 91: U\n      Turn 92: U\n      Turn 93: U\n      Turn 94: U\n      Turn 95: S\n\n  But wait, the actions are for turns84 to 95, and the state at turn95 is after the action of turn94: we are at9. The action at turn95 is taken and then we are at turn96 at9. The state at turn95 is before the action or after the action?\n\n  According to the update rule: at turn95, we are at y_{95}=9. Then we take action a_{95}=S, and then y_{96}=9+0=9.\n\n  The requirement is to be at (0,9) at turn95, which is satisfied.\n\n  So it is fine.\n\n  Therefore, the minimal number of turns H is 12.\n\n  We output the sequence.\n</think>\nTo reach position (0, 9) from (0, 0) at turn \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 84 + 12 - 1 = 95\\) with minimal turns \\(H = 12\\), avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\), the following sequence of actions is determined:\n\n- Start at turn 84 at \\(y = 0\\).\n- Use \"S\" (stay) at turns 84 and 85 to remain at \\(y = 0\\) (safe, as \\(y = 0\\) has no cars).\n- Use \"U\" (up) at turns 86 to 94 to move from \\(y = 0\\) to \\(y = 9\\) by turn 95.\n- Use \"S\" at turn 95 to remain at \\(y = 9\\) (action does not change position but is included to complete \\(H = 12\\) actions).\n\nThe path avoids all unsafe freeways at critical turns:\n- Freeways 3, 4, 5 are unsafe at turns 84, 85, 86; avoided by staying at \\(y = 0\\).\n- Freeway 6 is unsafe at turn 86; avoided by being at \\(y = 0\\).\n- Freeway 7 is unsafe at turns 90, 91, 92; avoided by moving through \\(y = 7\\) at turn 93 (safe: car at freeway 7 covers [1, 12] at turn 93, 0 not in span).\n- Freeways 1, 2, 8 are unsafe at turns 96, 97, 98; not reached as the goal is at turn 95.\n\nThe sequence ensures the player is at (0, 9) at turn 95.\n\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{array}{c}\n\\text{Turn } 84:  \\text{S} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 85:  \\text{S} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 86:  \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 87:  \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 88:  \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 89:  \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 90:  \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 91:  \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 92:  \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 93:  \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 94:  \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 95:  \\text{S} \\\\\n\\end{array}\n}",

The player moves up, down, or stays each turn, changing y by +1, -1, or 0, staying within 0 to 9.\n\nCars move left or right with constant speed, and their positions change linearly over time. A collision happens only if at some turn T, the player is on a freeway y, and for that freeway, there's a car where 0 is in its span at that exact turn. Importantly, when I move to a new row, I'm not on that row until the next turn, so I only care about the cars on my current row at each turn.\n\nLet me denote the current turn as t₁ = 90.\n\nI start at y=0, and I need to reach y=9.\n\nSince I can only change y by at most 1 per turn, the minimum number of turns to go from 0 to 9 is 9 turns if I go straight up. But I might need to avoid cars, so I might have to detour or wait, which could take more turns.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out for each freeway and each turn, whether there is a car covering position 0 at that turn.\n\nThe car positions are given at t₁=90, and I need for future turns.\n\nThe car update: for left-moving cars, span at T is [h - s*(T-t₁), τ - s*(T-t₁)]\n\nFor right-moving, it's [τ + s*(T-t₁), h + s*(T-t₁)]\n\nAnd collision if 0 is in the span at turn T when I'm on that freeway.\n\nSince the cars move continuously, but we're sampling at integer turns, I think.\n\nAlso, the span includes both ends, I assume.\n\nNow, let's list all cars per freeway at t=90.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (-48, -59, right, 4)\n\nSince it's right-moving, the head is at h, tail at τ? The notation says \"head h, tail τ\", and for right-moving, span is [τ, h]? Let me read carefully.\n\nIt says: for right-moving: \"Span(t₁) = [τ, h]\" and then Span(T) = [τ + s*(T-t₁), h + s*(T-t₁)]\n\nSimilarly for left-moving: Span(t₁) = [h, τ] and Span(T) = [h - s*(T-t₁), τ - s*(T-t₁)]\n\nIn the car state table, for freeway 1: (-48, -59, right, 4)\n\nI think the first number is head, second is tail.\n\nFor right-moving, at t₁, span is [τ, h] = [-59, -48]? But -59 < -48, so [τ, h] should be from tail to head, so if tail is -59 and head is -48, that means the car is from left to right, so position from -59 to -48.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, head and tail might be such that h > τ or something.\n\nBut in the update, for right-moving, span at T is [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] where ΔT = T - t₁.\n\nSimilarly for left, [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT].\n\nNow, collision at T if 0 is in [low, high] for some car on that row.\n\n0 is the x-position we care about, since player is at x=0 always.\n\nNow for freeway 1: car: head h=-48, tail τ=-59, right, s=4.\n\nSo at t₁=90, span is [τ, h] = [-59, -48] for right-moving? Let's confirm.\n\nIt says: for right-moving, Span(t₁) = [τ, h]\n\nIn the table, it's given as (head, tail, dir, speed), so for this, head=-48, tail=-59.\n\nSince it's right-moving, the tail is at more negative, I assume.\n\nSo at t₁, span [τ, h] = [-59, -48]\n\nThen at time T, span [τ + s(T-t₁), h + s(T-t₁)] = [-59 + 4(T-90), -48 + 4(T-90)]\n\nSet this equal to [A, B] where A = -59 + 4(T-90), B = -48 + 4(T-90)\n\n0 is in [A,B] if A <= 0 <= B.\n\nSo -59 + 4(T-90) <= 0 <= -48 + 4(T-90)\n\nFirst inequality: -59 + 4ΔT <= 0 => 4ΔT <= 59 => ΔT <= 59/4 = 14.75, so ΔT <= 14 since integer.\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= -48 + 4ΔT => 48 <= 4ΔT => ΔT >= 12.\n\nSo for ΔT from 12 to 14 inclusive, 0 is covered.\n\nΔT = T - 90, so at T=102,103,104.\n\nT=90 +12=102, 90+13=103, 90+14=104.\n\nSimilarly, for other cars.\n\nBut freeway 1 has only one car, so unsafe when T=102,103,104.\n\nNow, similarly for other freeways.\n\nFirst, let's list all freeways and their cars.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (-48,-59,right,4) unsafe T=102,103,104\n\nFreeway 2: same as freeway 1? (-48,-59,right,4) so same, unsafe T=102,103,104\n\nNow freeway 3: two cars: (48,37,right,4) and (0,-11,right,4)\n\nFirst car: head=48, tail=37, right, s=4\n\nFor right-moving, span at t₁: [τ, h] = [37,48]\n\nAt T: [37 + 4ΔT, 48 + 4ΔT]\n\n0 in [37+4ΔT, 48+4ΔT]?\n\n37+4ΔT <= 0 <= 48+4ΔT\n\nFirst: 37+4ΔT <=0 => 4ΔT <= -37, impossible since ΔT >=0, 4ΔT >=0, 37>0, so never <=0. Thus 0 cannot be <= left end if left end is positive.\n\nA <= 0 <= B\n\nIf A =37+4ΔT >=37>0, so A >0, then 0 < A, so 0 not >= A, so not in [A,B].\n\nSimilarly, B=48+4ΔT>0, but 0 is less than A, so not in interval.\n\nSo this car never covers 0, since it starts at 37 to 48 and moves right, so always positive and increasing.\n\nSimilarly, second car on freeway 3: (0,-11,right,4)\n\nHead=0, tail=-11, right, s=4\n\nSpan at t₁: [τ,h] = [-11,0]\n\nAt T: [-11 +4ΔT, 0 +4ΔT] = [-11+4ΔT, 4ΔT]\n\n0 in this if -11+4ΔT <= 0 <= 4ΔT\n\nFirst: -11+4ΔT <=0 => 4ΔT <=11 => ΔT <= 11/4=2.75, so ΔT <=2\n\nSecond: 0 <= 4ΔT => ΔT >=0\n\nSo for ΔT=0,1,2\n\nΔT=0: T=90, [ -11, 0], 0 is included? 0 <=0 is true, and -11<=0 true, so yes.\n\nΔT=1: T=91, [-11+4= -7, 4], -7<=0<=4? 0>=-7 yes, 0<=4 yes.\n\nΔT=2: T=92, [-11+8= -3, 8], -3<=0<=8 yes.\n\nΔT=3: T=93, [-11+12=1, 12], 1<=0<=12? 0>=1 false, so no.\n\nSo for car 2 on freeway 3, unsafe at T=90,91,92.\n\nBut at T=90, we are at turn t₁, and player is at y=0, not on freeway 3, so we only care when we are on the freeway.\n\nAt turn T, if we are on freeway k, and for that freeway, 0 in some car's span.\n\nFor freeway 3, at T=90, if we were on y=3, but we are at y=0, so not relevant now.\n\nSimilarly, for future turns.\n\nSo freeway 3 has two cars, but first car never covers 0, second car covers 0 at T=90,91,92.\n\nSo if we are on freeway 3 at T=90,91,92, we collide with second car.\n\nT=90 is now, but we are not on it.\n\nNow freeway 4: same as freeway 3? (48,37,right,4) and (0,-11,right,4)\n\nSo same as freeway 3: unsafe when on y=4 at T=90,91,92 due to second car.\n\nFirst car same as before, never covers 0.\n\nSimilarly freeway 5: same, (48,37,right,4) and (0,-11,right,4), so unsafe at T=90,91,92 on y=5.\n\nNow freeway 6: (48,83,left,36)\n\nHead=48, tail=83, left, s=36.\n\nFor left-moving, span at t₁: [h, τ] = [48,83]? But 48 to 83, that seems odd for left-moving.\n\nTypically for left-moving, head might be left, but here it says head and tail.\n\nFrom the update: for left-moving, Span(t₁) = [h, τ]\n\nAnd Span(T) = [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT]\n\nNow, in this case, h=48, τ=83, so [48,83], which is increasing, but for left-moving, it should be decreasing position? I think there might be confusion in head and tail definition.\n\nPerhaps head is always the front, so for left-moving, front is left, so smaller x.\n\nHere head=48, tail=83, but 48 < 83, and it's left-moving, so as it moves left, head decreases, tail decreases.\n\nAt T, span [48 - 36ΔT, 83 - 36ΔT]\n\n0 in [48-36ΔT, 83-36ΔT] if 48-36ΔT <= 0 <= 83-36ΔT\n\nFirst inequality: 48-36ΔT <=0 => 48 <=36ΔT => ΔT >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈1.333, so ΔT >=2\n\nSecond: 0 <= 83-36ΔT => 36ΔT <=83 => ΔT <=83/36≈2.305, so ΔT <=2\n\nSo ΔT >=2 and ΔT <=2, so only at ΔT=2.\n\nT=90+2=92.\n\nAt T=92, span [48-72= -24, 83-72=11], so [-24,11], 0 is in this, yes.\n\nAt other times, not.\n\nSo freeway 6 unsafe only at T=92.\n\nNow freeway 7: three cars: (48,37,right,4), (12,1,right,4), (-24,-35,right,4)\n\nFirst car: (48,37,right,4) as before, never covers 0.\n\nSecond car: (12,1,right,4) head=12, tail=1, right, s=4\n\nSpan at t₁: [τ,h] = [1,12]\n\nAt T: [1+4ΔT, 12+4ΔT]\n\n0 in [1+4ΔT,12+4ΔT]? 1+4ΔT <=0 <=12+4ΔT\n\nFirst: 1+4ΔT <=0 impossible since >=1>0.\n\nSo never.\n\nThird car: (-24,-35,right,4) head=-24, tail=-35, right, s=4\n\nSpan at t₁: [τ,h] = [-35,-24]\n\nAt T: [-35+4ΔT, -24+4ΔT]\n\n0 in this if -35+4ΔT <=0 <= -24+4ΔT\n\nFirst: -35+4ΔT <=0 => 4ΔT <=35 => ΔT <=35/4=8.75, so ΔT <=8\n\nSecond: 0 <= -24+4ΔT => 24 <=4ΔT => ΔT >=6\n\nSo ΔT from 6 to 8 inclusive: T=96,97,98.\n\nΔT=6: T=96, [-35+24= -11, -24+24=0], 0 is included? -11<=0<=0 yes.\n\nΔT=7: T=97, [-35+28= -7, -24+28=4], -7<=0<=4 yes.\n\nΔT=8: T=98, [-35+32= -3, -24+32=8], -3<=0<=8 yes.\n\nΔT=9: T=99, [-35+36=1, -24+36=12], 1<=0 false.\n\nSo unsafe at T=96,97,98.\n\nNow freeway 8: (-48,-59,right,4) same as freeway 1, unsafe at T=102,103,104.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9, which is a freeway? Freeways are y=1 to 8, y=9 is the goal, no cars, I think.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are not freeways, so no cars, safe.\n\nNow, let's summarize for each freeway and each turn, when it is unsafe.\n\nTurns start from t₁=90.\n\nWe care about turns from 90 onwards.\n\nLet me make a table or list for each y from 1 to 8, which turns are unsafe.\n\ny=1: unsafe at T=102,103,104\n\ny=2: same as y=1, T=102,103,104\n\ny=3: unsafe at T=90,91,92 (from the second car)\n\ny=4: same, T=90,91,92\n\ny=5: same, T=90,91,92\n\ny=6: unsafe only at T=92\n\ny=7: unsafe at T=96,97,98\n\ny=8: unsafe at T=102,103,104\n\nNow, the player starts at turn 90, y=0.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nAt each turn, we choose action U, D, or S, changing y by +1, -1, 0, but y must stay in [0,9].\n\nWe need to find a sequence of actions to reach y=9 in min turns, avoiding being on a freeway when it is unsafe for that turn.\n\nSpecifically, for each turn T, if we are on y=k between 1 and 8, then T must not be unsafe for k.\n\nSince we move after the state, I think.\n\nThe position is updated after action.\n\nAt turn t, we are at position, then we choose action, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nThen at turn t+1, we are at new position.\n\nCollision is checked at the turn when we are on the freeway.\n\nFrom the note: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 in Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 in Span(T) but not in Span(T+1).\"\n\nSo at turn T, we are on y_T, and we check for cars on y_T at turn T.\n\nIf we move, at turn T we are on y_T, and at turn T+1 we are on y_{T+1}.\n\nFor example, at turn T, on y, we choose to move to y+1, then at turn T+1, we are on y+1.\n\nAnd at turn T, we are on y, so we care about cars on y at T.\n\nAt turn T+1, we are on y+1, care about cars on y+1 at T+1.\n\nNow, start at turn 90, y=0. y=0 has no cars, safe.\n\nWe need to reach y=9, which has no cars, safe.\n\nThe path must go through y=1 to 8 at some points.\n\nMinimal turns: since we need to increase y from 0 to 9, min 9 actions, from turn 90 to 98, ending at y=9 at turn 98? Let's see.\n\nTurn 90: start at y=0\n\nAfter action at turn 90, we go to y_{91} = y_90 + Δy, so at turn 91, we are at y_{91}.\n\nSimilarly, after H actions, at turn t₁ + H, we are at position, and we want y_{t₁ + H} =9.\n\nt₁=90.\n\nAfter 0 actions, at turn 90, y=0.\n\nAfter 1 action (at turn 90), at turn 91, y=y_91.\n\n...\n\nAfter k actions, at turn 90+k, y=y_{90+k}\n\nWe want for some H, at turn 90+H, y=9.\n\nAnd H min.\n\ny changes by at most 1 per step, so min H=9, to go from 0 to 9 in 9 steps.\n\nBut may not be possible due to obstacles.\n\nNow, let's see the unsafe times.\n\nFirst, y=3,4,5 are unsafe at T=90,91,92. That is, turn 90,91,92.\n\nIf we are on y=3,4, or 5 at turn 90,91, or 92, we collide.\n\nBut at turn 90, we are at y=0, not on 3,4,5.\n\nSimilarly, y=6 unsafe only at T=92.\n\ny=7 unsafe at T=96,97,98.\n\ny=1,2,8 unsafe at T=102,103,104, which is later.\n\nSince we want min H, we should try to go fast, so T=102+ is late, H=12+? t=90 to 102 is 12 turns? From turn 90 to T, the number of turns passed is T-90.\n\nAt turn 90, after 0 actions.\n\nAfter 1 action, turn 91.\n\nAfter H actions, turn 90+H.\n\nWe want y_{90+H} =9.\n\nMin H=9, so turn 99.\n\ny_{90+H} at turn 90+H.\n\nFor H=9, at turn 99, y=9.\n\nNow, can we reach y=9 by turn 99?\n\nThat means we need to be at y=9 at turn 99.\n\nNow, the path: we start at turn 90, y=0.\n\nAt turn 91, y= something, and so on, up to turn 99, y=9.\n\nAt each turn T from 91 to 98, we might be on freeway y from 1 to 8, and must not be unsafe at that turn for that y.\n\nAt turn 99, y=9, safe.\n\nNow, let's list the turns from 91 to 98, which are the critical points for freeways 1-8.\n\nTurn T | unsafe freeways\n\nFirst, for T=91: unsafe for y=3,4,5 (since unsafe at T=91)\n\nSimilarly T=92: unsafe for y=3,4,5 and y=6\n\nT=93: not unsafe for any, I think. y=3,4,5 unsafe only up to 92, y=6 only 92, y=7 at 96-98, etc.\n\nT=93: no unsafe, since y=3,4,5 safe after 92, y=6 only 92, y=7 later.\n\nSimilarly T=94,95: safe for all.\n\nT=96: unsafe for y=7\n\nT=97: unsafe for y=7\n\nT=98: unsafe for y=7\n\nT=99: if on freeway, but y=9 not freeway, safe.\n\nNow for min H=9, we need to be at y=9 at turn 99.\n\nThat means from turn 90 to 99, we move from y=0 to y=9 in 9 steps, so we must go up every turn, no down or stay, because if we stay or go down, we won't reach in 9 turns.\n\ny starts at 0 at turn 90.\n\nAfter action at turn 90, y_91 = y_90 + Δy, so at turn 91, y could be 0 or 1.\n\nSimilarly, to reach y=9 at turn 99, after 9 actions, we need exactly 9 up moves, no down, no stay, because each up increases y by 1, from 0 to 9 in 9 steps.\n\nStart y_90=0.\n\nAfter first action (turn 90), y_91 = 0 or 1.\n\nAfter second action (turn 91), y_92 = y_91 + Δy, etc.\n\nAfter k actions, y_{90+k} = y_90 + sum_{i=0}^{k-1} Δy_i\n\ny_90 =0\n\nWe want y_{90+H} =9\n\nSo sum_{i=0}^{H-1} Δy_i =9\n\nEach Δy_i = -1,0, or +1.\n\nMin H when all Δy_i = +1, H=9.\n\nIf some 0 or -1, H>9.\n\nFor H=9, all actions must be U, so we go up every turn.\n\nThen the position at each turn:\n\nTurn 90: y=0 (safe)\n\nTurn 91: y=1\n\nTurn 92: y=2\n\nTurn 93: y=3\n\nTurn 94: y=4\n\nTurn 95: y=5\n\nTurn 96: y=6\n\nTurn 97: y=7\n\nTurn 98: y=8\n\nTurn 99: y=9 (goal)\n\nNow, we need to check for each turn from 91 to 98, when we are on freeway, if it is safe.\n\nTurn 91: y=1, freeway 1. Is it unsafe at T=91?\n\nFrom above, y=1 unsafe only at T=102,103,104, not at 91. So safe.\n\nTurn 92: y=2, freeway 2. Similarly, unsafe only at 102-104, so safe at 92.\n\nTurn 93: y=3, freeway 3. Unsafe at T=90,91,92. T=93 is later, so safe? T=90,91,92 unsafe, T=93 not unsafe, since after 92.\n\nSimilarly, turn 94: y=4, freeway 4. Unsafe at 90,91,92, T=94 safe.\n\nTurn 95: y=5, freeway 5. Same, unsafe at 90,91,92, T=95 safe.\n\nTurn 96: y=6, freeway 6. Unsafe only at T=92, T=96 safe.\n\nTurn 97: y=7, freeway 7. Unsafe at T=96,97,98. T=97 is unsafe!\n\nAt turn 97, y=7, which is unsafe.\n\nCollision.\n\nSimilarly, turn 98: y=8, freeway 8. Unsafe at T=102,103,104? T=98 is before, so safe? y=8 unsafe at 102,103,104, T=98 safe.\n\nBut turn 97 is problem.\n\nIn this path, at turn 97, y=7, which is unsafe because T=97 is unsafe for y=7.\n\nSo we cannot be on y=7 at turn 97.\n\nBut in the direct up path, we are on y=7 at turn 97, which is unsafe.\n\nThus, collision at turn 97.\n\nTherefore, we cannot go straight up in 9 turns.\n\nWe need to avoid this.\n\nPerhaps we can delay or something.\n\nSince min H=9 not possible, we need H=10 or more.\n\nBut let's see if we can do H=10.\n\nH=10 means at turn 100, y=9.\n\nBut we might be able to do it faster.\n\nFirst, what is the issue? The problem is at turn 96,97,98, y=7 is unsafe.\n\nIn the path, we need to not be on y=7 during those turns.\n\nSince we are going up, we might be on y=7 earlier or later.\n\nFor example, if we go slower, we might be on y=7 before or after the unsafe times.\n\nUnsafe times for y=7 are T=96,97,98.\n\nSo we need to not be on y=7 at turns 96,97, or 98.\n\nSimilarly, other constraints.\n\nNow, for H=10, we have one extra turn, so we can stay or go down once, but since we need to reach y=9, going down might not help, so probably stay once.\n\nWe start at y=0 turn 90.\n\nAfter 10 actions, at turn 100, y=9.\n\nThe net displacement must be +9, so with 10 actions, we need 9 up and 1 stay, or 10 up but that would be y=10, impossible, or 8 up and 1 down and 1 up, etc., but y=10 not allowed, so must have exactly 9 up and one other action: either stay or down.\n\nIf down, then we need to compensate, so net +9, so if one down, we need 10 up and one down? 10 actions: let S be number of stay, U up, D down.\n\nThen U + D + S =10\n\ny_final - y_initial = U - D =9\n\ny_initial=0, so U - D =9\n\nAlso U + D + S =10\n\nThen (U - D) + 2D + S =9 + 2D + S =10, so 2D + S =1.\n\nSince D and S nonneg int, possibilities: D=0, S=1; or D=1, S= -1 impossible; so only D=0, S=1.\n\nThus, for H=10, we must have 9 up and 1 stay.\n\nSo we stay one turn somewhere.\n\nNow, the position sequence: we start at turn 90 y=0.\n\nAfter actions, at turn 91 to 100, y from some to 9.\n\nWe need to choose when to stay.\n\nThe stay action will make us stay at some y for that turn.\n\nNow, we need to avoid being on unsafe freeway at unsafe times.\n\nSpecifically, for y=7, avoid turns 96,97,98.\n\nAlso, other constraints.\n\nIn the direct path, we had problem at turn 97 y=7.\n\nNow with one stay, we can, for example, stay at some safe point to shift the timing.\n\nFor example, if we stay at turn K, then the whole sequence after is delayed.\n\nWe need to be at y=9 at turn 100.\n\nList the turns we care about: from turn 91 to 99, since at turn 100, y=9 safe.\n\nTurn 91 to 99: positions y1 to y9? Not necessarily.\n\nAt turn 91, y could be 0 or 1, etc.\n\nSince we have one stay, let’s say we stay at some turn.\n\nThe unsafe periods:\n\ny=3,4,5 unsafe at T=90,91,92\n\nBut T=90,91,92 are early, and we start from y=0.\n\ny=6 unsafe at T=92\n\ny=7 unsafe at T=96,97,98\n\ny=1,2,8 unsafe at T=102,103,104, which is late, turn 102,103,104, and we want to finish by turn 100, so for H=10, turn 100, before 102, so y=1,2,8 safe at those times.\n\nSimilarly, y=3,4,5 unsafe only at 90,91,92, which are before we might be there if we go fast, but with stay, we might be later.\n\nIn H=10, we reach at turn 100, so turns 91 to 99 are the freeway turns possibly.\n\nTurn 91 to 99: T from 91 to 99.\n\nUnsafe:\n\n- For y=3: unsafe at 90,91,92 → at T=91,92 unsafe if on y=3; T=93+ safe\n\nSimilarly y=4: unsafe at 91,92 if on y=4? T=90,91,92, so for T=91,92 unsafe if on y=4; T=93+ safe\n\ny=5: same, T=91,92 unsafe if on y=5; T=93+ safe\n\ny=6: unsafe only at T=92, so if on y=6 at T=92, unsafe; else safe\n\ny=7: unsafe at T=96,97,98, so if on y=7 at those turns, unsafe\n\ny=1,2,8: unsafe at T=102,103,104, which is after 100, so for T<=100, safe.\n\nNow, we need to have a path from y=0 at turn 90 to y=9 at turn 100, with 9 up and 1 stay.\n\nThe position at each turn:\n\nTurn 90: y=0 (safe)\n\nThen after action at turn 90, turn 91: y= y90 + a90, so y=0 or 1\n\nSimilarly, up to turn 100: y=9\n\nSince we have one stay, most turns we go up, but one turn we stay, so y stays the same for that turn.\n\nNow, to avoid the y=7 at unsafe times.\n\nThe unsafe times for y=7 are 96,97,98.\n\nSo we need that at turn 96,97,98, we are not on y=7.\n\nThat means, at those turns, we are either below or above y=7, or on y=7 but it's safe, but it's not safe at those times, so we must not be on y=7.\n\nSimilarly, other constraints.\n\nNow, since we need to go through all y, we can be on y=7 at other times.\n\nFor example, if we can be on y=7 before turn 96 or after turn 98.\n\nAfter turn 98, turn 99 or 100.\n\nBut turn 100 is y=9, not freeway.\n\nTurn 99: if on y=8, freeway 8, which is safe at T=99, since unsafe only at 102+.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, let's think about the timing.\n\nSuppose we go up normally but insert a stay somewhere to avoid being on y=7 at 96-98.\n\nFor example, if we are on y=7 at turn 95, or turn 99, etc.\n\nTurn 95: y=7 at T=95, is it unsafe? y=7 unsafe only at 96,97,98, so T=95 safe.\n\nSimilarly, T=99 safe for y=7.\n\nT=99: turn 99, y=7 would be safe, since unsafe only 96,97,98.\n\nBut we want to be at y=9 at turn 100, so at turn 99, we might be at y=8 or y=9, but if at y=9, turn 99, but turn 99 is before action? Let's clarify.\n\nAt turn T, position y_T.\n\nAfter action at T, y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy_T.\n\nAt turn T, we are on y_T.\n\nFor turn 99, if we are on y=9, safe, no freeway.\n\nIf on y=8, freeway 8, safe at T=99.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBack to y=7.\n\nWe need to avoid y=7 at T=96,97,98.\n\nPossible to be on y=7 at T=95, which is safe, or at T=99, safe.\n\nT=99: if at turn 99 we are on y=7, then after action we go to y=8 or something.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9 at turn 100.\n\nNow, let's sketch a path.\n\nSuppose we want to be on y=7 at turn 95 or turn 99.\n\nFirst, turn 95: T=95.\n\nIf we are on y=7 at turn 95, safe.\n\nThen from there, we can go up to y=8 at turn 96, y=9 at turn 97, but we have H=10, so to turn 100.\n\nLet's think step by step.\n\nStart turn 90 y=0.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at turn 100.\n\nWith 9 up and 1 stay.\n\nThe stay can be at any turn from 90 to 99, but at turn 99, if we stay, y stays, but we need y=9 at turn 100, so if we stay at turn 99, y_{100} = y_{99}, so y_{99} must be 9, but then at turn 99 we are at y=9, safe, but we have to have used 9 ups before, so it's possible, but the stay at turn 99 means we do nothing when already at 9, but we need to be at 9 at turn 100, so if we are at 9 at turn 99 and stay, we are at 9 at turn 100.\n\nBut we could be at 8 at turn 99 and go up to 9 at turn 100.\n\nSimilarly, other points.\n\nBut for avoiding y=7 at 96-98, we can choose to be on y=7 earlier or later.\n\nOption 1: be on y=7 at turn 95.\n\nThen turn 95: y=7, safe.\n\nThen turn 96: we can go up to y=8, since y=7 unsafe at T=96.\n\nAt turn 96, if we are on y=7, unsafe, so we must not be on y=7 at turn 96.\n\nSimilarly for 97,98.\n\nSo at turn 96, we should be on y=6 or y=8 or something else.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo if at turn 95 we are on y=7, then at turn 96, we must move away, either up to y=8 or down to y=6, but down might not be efficient.\n\nSince we need to go up, better to go up.\n\nSo from turn 95 y=7, at turn 96 we go to y=8.\n\nThen turn 96: y=8, freeway 8, which is safe at T=96, since unsafe only at 102+.\n\nThen turn 97: we can go to y=9 or stay or down, but to reach y=9 soon, go to y=9.\n\nThen at turn 97, y=9? Turn 97 position y_97.\n\nIf at turn 96 we are at y=8, after action at turn 96, y_97 = y_96 + a96.\n\nIf a96=U, y_97=9.\n\nThen at turn 97, y=9, safe.\n\nSimilarly, we can reach by turn 97 if no stay, but we have one stay to use.\n\nIn this case, we are at y=9 at turn 97, but we need to be at turn 100 for H=10? Let's see the turns.\n\nStart turn 90 y=0.\n\nAfter action turn 90: to y=1 (if up)\n\nTurn 91: y=1\n\n...\n\nTo be at y=7 at turn 95.\n\nTurn 95: y=7\n\nThis requires that from turn 90 to 95, we go from y=0 to y=7 in 5 steps? Turns:\n\nTurn 90: y=0\n\nAfter action turn 90: turn 91 y=?\n\nTo have y=7 at turn 95, that is after 5 actions from turn 90 to 94? Let's index.\n\nAt turn t, y_t.\n\ny_90 = 0\n\ny_91 = y_90 + a90\n\n...\n\ny_95 = y_94 + a94\n\nWe want y_95 =7\n\nSince y_90=0, and each action changes y by at most 1, to have y_95=7, we need at least 7 up moves in the first 5 actions? From turn 90 to 95, there are 5 actions: actions at t=90,91,92,93,94 determine y_91 to y_95.\n\ny_91 = 0 + a90\n\ny_92 = y_91 + a91\n\n...\n\ny_95 = y_94 + a94\n\nSo y_95 = a90 + a91 + a92 + a93 + a94\n\nEach a_t is -1,0,1.\n\ny_95 = sum_{i=90}^{94} a_i\n\nWe want y_95=7, but with 5 actions, max y_95=5 if all up, min -5.\n\n7>5, impossible to have y_95=7 with only 5 actions.\n\ny_95 is after 5 actions from turn 90.\n\nNumber of actions: from turn 90 to 94 inclusive, that's 5 actions: a90 to a94, setting y91 to y95.\n\ny91 = y90 + a90\n\ny92 = y91 + a91 = y90 + a90 + a91\n\n...\n\ny95 = y90 + a90 + a91 + a92 + a93 + a94\n\ny90=0, so y95 = sum_{k=90}^{94} a_k\n\nSince each a_k <=1, y95 <=5.\n\nCannot be 7.\n\nSimilarly, to have y at turn T, it depends on the actions before.\n\nTo be at y=7 at turn 95, we need y_95=7.\n\ny_95 = sum of first 5 actions? Actions from t=90 to t=94 affect y_91 to y_95.\n\nThe position at turn T is y_T, determined by actions up to t=T-1.\n\ny_T = y_90 + sum_{i=90}^{T-1} a_i\n\nFor T=95, y_95 = 0 + sum_{i=90}^{94} a_i\n\nWith 5 terms, each +1 max, so y_95 <=5.\n\nSimilarly, min -5.\n\nSo y_95 cannot be 7; max is 5.\n\nSimilarly, to be at y=7 at turn 95 is impossible; earliest to be at y=7 is turn 97 with all up.\n\nWith all up: turn 90: y=0\n\na90=U, turn91: y=1\n\na91=U, turn92: y=2\n\na92=U, turn93: y=3\n\na93=U, turn94: y=4\n\na94=U, turn95: y=5\n\na95=U, turn96: y=6\n\na96=U, turn97: y=7\n\na97=U, turn98: y=8\n\na98=U, turn99: y=9\n\nThen at turn99, y=9, but for H=9, we are done at turn99.\n\nBut earlier we had problem at turn97 y=7 unsafe.\n\nWith H=10, we have an extra action.\n\nBack to H=10.\n\nWe want y_100=9.\n\nWith 10 actions: a90 to a99.\n\ny_100 = y_90 + sum_{i=90}^{99} a_i = 0 + sum_{i=90}^{99} a_i =9\n\nSo sum a_i from 90 to 99 =9\n\nEach a_i = -1,0,1.\n\nSince U- D =9, and U+D+S=10, so S=1, D=0 as before.\n\nSo 9 up and 1 stay.\n\nThe stay can be at any of the 10 actions.\n\nNow, the position sequence depends on where we stay.\n\nWe need to avoid being on y=7 at turns 96,97,98.\n\nAlso, other unsafe points.\n\nFirst, let's list the unsafe turns for relevant y.\n\nFor y=3,4,5: unsafe at T=91,92 if on that y.\n\nT=91 and 92 are unsafe for y=3,4,5.\n\nFor example, at T=91, if on y=3,4, or 5, collide.\n\nSimilarly T=92, if on y=3,4,5, or y=6.\n\ny=6 unsafe only at T=92.\n\ny=7 unsafe at T=96,97,98.\n\nNow, in the all-up path, we are:\n\nTurn 91: y=1 safe\n\nTurn 92: y=2 safe (since y=2 unsafe only at 102+)\n\nTurn 93: y=3 safe (T=93>92, safe for y=3)\n\nTurn 94: y=4 safe\n\nTurn 95: y=5 safe\n\nTurn 96: y=6 safe (y=6 unsafe only at T=92, T=96 safe)\n\nTurn 97: y=7 unsafe! Problem.\n\nTurn 98: y=8 safe\n\nTurn 99: y=9 safe\n\nBut turn 97 y=7 unsafe.\n\nSo we need to modify this.\n\nWith one stay, we can insert a stay somewhere to shift.\n\nFor example, if we stay at an earlier turn, we arrive later, so y=7 is later.\n\nIf we stay at a later turn, we might be on y=7 earlier.\n\nOption: stay at turn 96 or 97 to avoid being on y=7 at that turn.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nFirst, suppose we stay at some turn before.\n\nFor example, stay at turn 93.\n\nThen the sequence:\n\nTurn 90: y=0\n\na90=U, turn91: y=1\n\na91=U, turn92: y=2\n\na92=U, turn93: y=3\n\na93=S, stay, so turn94: y=3 (since a93=0)\n\nThen a94=U, turn95: y=4\n\na95=U, turn96: y=5\n\na96=U, turn97: y=6\n\na97=U, turn98: y=7\n\nBut at turn98, y=7, and T=98 unsafe! Collision.\n\nWorse, now at turn97 y=6, but turn97 is not unsafe for y=6, only T=92.\n\nBut at turn98 y=7 unsafe.\n\nIf we stay earlier.\n\nStay at turn 92.\n\nTurn 90: y=0\n\na90=U, turn91: y=1\n\na91=U, turn92: y=2\n\na92=S, stay, turn93: y=2\n\na93=U, turn94: y=3\n\na94=U, turn95: y=4\n\na95=U, turn96: y=5\n\na96=U, turn97: y=6\n\na97=U, turn98: y=7  // unsafe if T=98\n\na98=U, turn99: y=8\n\na99=U, turn100: y=9\n\nAt turn98 y=7, T=98 unsafe.\n\nStill problem.\n\nIf we stay at turn 91.\n\na90=U, turn91: y=1\n\na91=S, stay, turn92: y=1\n\na92=U, turn93: y=2\n\na93=U, turn94: y=3\n\na94=U, turn95: y=4\n\na95=U, turn96: y=5\n\na96=U, turn97: y=6\n\na97=U, turn98: y=7  // unsafe\n\nSame.\n\nTo avoid y=7 at 96,97,98, we need to be on y=7 before or after.\n\nEarliest we can be on y=7 is turn 97 with all up, but that's unsafe.\n\nWith stay, we can be later.\n\nFor example, if we stay at turn 97.\n\nBut at turn 97, if we are on y=7 and stay, we are still on y=7 at turn 97, which is unsafe, collision.\n\nIf we are not on y=7 at turn 97.\n\nLet's list the position we want.\n\nSuppose we want to be on y=7 at turn 95 or turn 99.\n\nTurn 95: to be at y=7 at turn 95.\n\ny_95 = sum_{i=90}^{94} a_i\n\nMax 5, so y_95 <=5, cannot be 7.\n\nImpossible.\n\nTurn 99: to be at y=7 at turn 99.\n\ny_99 = sum_{i=90}^{98} a_i\n\nWe want y_99=7.\n\nThen at turn 99, y=7, which is safe since T=99 not 96-98.\n\nThen a99=U to go to y=8 at turn100, but we need y=9 at turn100, so if y_99=7, a99=U, y100=8, not 9.\n\nWe need y100=9.\n\nIf y_99=8, a99=U, y100=9.\n\nOr y_99=9, a99=S, y100=9.\n\nBut for y=7, we can be at turn 99 with y_99=7.\n\nThen from there, we go up to 8 at turn100, but y100=8, not 9.\n\nTo reach y=9 at turn100, we need y100=9, so y_99 + a99 =9.\n\nIf y_99=9, a99=S or U, but U would go to 10, invalid, so a99=S.\n\nIf y_99=8, a99=U, y100=9.\n\nIf y_99=7, a99=U, y100=8<9, not.\n\nSo y_99 must be 8 or 9.\n\nIf y_99=9, we are done, but for H=10, we reach at turn100, but if at turn99 y=9, and we stay, turn100 y=9.\n\nBut we can have y_99=8, then go up to 9 at turn100.\n\nNow, back to y=7.\n\nWe can be on y=7 at turn 99 only if y_99=7.\n\nBut y_99=7, then to reach y=9 at turn100, we need to go up twice, impossible in one action.\n\nSo we cannot be on y=7 at turn 99 if we want to reach y=9 at turn100.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 98, we can be on y=7.\n\ny_98 = sum_{i=90}^{97} a_i\n\nMax 8 with all up.\n\nIf all up to turn97, y_98=8? Let's see.\n\ny90=0\n\nAfter a90 U, y91=1\n\n...\n\nAfter a97 U, y98=8\n\ny98 = y90 + sum_{i=90}^{97} a_i\n\n8 actions from 90 to 97, max y98=8.\n\nMin -8.\n\nSo y98 can be 7.\n\nFor example, if we have one stay in the first 8 actions, then y98=7 if 7 up and one stay, or 8 up and one down, etc.\n\nBut we have 10 actions total for H=10.\n\nActions from a90 to a99, 10 actions.\n\ny100 = sum_{i=90}^{99} a_i =9\n\nWith 9 U and 1 S.\n\ny_t for t from 90 to 100.\n\nTo be on y=7 at turn 98, for example.\n\ny98 = sum_{i=90}^{97} a_i\n\nWe want y98=7.\n\nThen at turn 98, if y=7, and T=98, unsafe, so we cannot be on y=7 at turn 98.\n\nSimilarly for turn 97 and 96.\n\nSo we must not be on y=7 at turns 96,97,98.\n\nTherefore, we must be on y=7 at some other turn, like turn 95 or turn 99.\n\nBut turn 95: y95 = sum_{i=90}^{94} a_i <=5, cannot be 7.\n\nTurn 99: y99 = sum_{i=90}^{98} a_i\n\nIf y99=7, then at turn 99, y=7, safe since T=99 not unsafe for y=7.\n\nThen we can go to y=8 at turn100, but we need y=9, so not.\n\nIf y99=7, a99=U, y100=8<9.\n\nNot good.\n\nIf we are on y=7 at turn 94 or earlier, but y94 = sum_{i=90}^{93} a_i <=4, cannot be 7.\n\nSo the only possible turns to be on y=7 are turn 97 or 98 with all up, or turn 96 with y96=6 and go up to 7, but at turn 96 if we go to y=7, we are on y=7 at turn 96, unsafe.\n\nLet's list possible y_t for t around there.\n\nWith 9 up and 1 stay, the position sequence can vary.\n\nFor example, if we stay at an early turn, we progress slower.\n\nSuppose we stay at turn 90.\n\nThen a90=S, turn91: y=0\n\nThen a91=U, turn92: y=1\n\na92=U, turn93: y=2\n\na93=U, turn94: y=3\n\na94=U, turn95: y=4\n\na95=U, turn96: y=5\n\na96=U, turn97: y=6\n\na97=U, turn98: y=7  // unsafe at T=98\n\na98=U, turn99: y=8\n\na99=U, turn100: y=9\n\nStill y=7 at turn98 unsafe.\n\nIf we stay later, say at turn 97.\n\nBut at turn 97, if we are on y=7 and stay, we are on y=7 at turn 97, unsafe.\n\nIf we are not on y=7 at turn 97.\n\nFor example, at turn 96, y=6, then a96=S, stay at y=6, turn97: y=6\n\nThen a97=U, turn98: y=7  // T=98 unsafe\n\nSame.\n\na96=U, turn97: y=7, then if a97=S, turn98: y=7, unsafe at T=98.\n\nOr a97=D, turn98: y=6, then later go up, but we need to reach y=9.\n\nBut at turn98 y=6, then a98=U, turn99: y=7, then a99=U, turn100: y=8, not 9. Need another action, but H=10 only 10 actions, we are at y=8 at turn100, not 9.\n\nTo reach y=9, we need to be at y=8 or 9 at turn99 to go to 9 at turn100.\n\nBut let's not digress.\n\nPerhaps we can be on y=7 at turn 95, but impossible as y95<=5.\n\nSo for H=10, it seems difficult to avoid y=7 at 96-98 because those are the only turns we can be on y=7 with the given speed.\n\nWith the stay, we can be on y=7 at turn 98 if we have a down earlier, but we have only stay, no down, since D=0.\n\nIn H=10, we have only U and S, no D.\n\nSo y increases by 1 or stays the same.\n\nSo the position y_t is non-decreasing, and increases by at most 1 per turn.\n\nFrom y90=0, to have y100=9, with 10 steps, 9 increases and 1 stay.\n\nSo y_t increases from 0 to 9, with one plateau.\n\nThe values: y_t can be from 0 to 9.\n\nFor y=7, it must be hit at some turn between, say, turn 97 to turn 98 in the all-up case, but with stay, it could be later.\n\nFor example, if we stay at turn 95, then y95=5 (if all up before), then y96=5 or 6, etc.\n\nLet's assume we go up as much as possible but insert stay to delay.\n\nSuppose we stay at turn 95.\n\nThen:\n\nTurn 90: y=0\n\na90=U, turn91: y=1\n\na91=U, turn92: y=2\n\na92=U, turn93: y=3\n\na93=U, turn94: y=4\n\na94=U, turn95: y=5\n\na95=S, turn96: y=5  (stay at y=5)\n\nThen a96=U, turn97: y=6\n\na97=U, turn98: y=7  // unsafe at T=98\n\na98=U, turn99: y=8\n\na99=U, turn100: y=9\n\nStill at turn98 y=7 unsafe.\n\nIf we stay at turn 96.\n\na90 to a95 U: turn91 y=1, turn92 y=2, turn93 y=3, turn94 y=4, turn95 y=5, turn96 y=6\n\na96=S, turn97: y=6\n\na97=U, turn98: y=7  // unsafe\n\nSame.\n\nStay at turn 97.\n\nBut at turn 97, if we are on y=7, and stay, we are on y=7 at turn 97, unsafe.\n\nSo we must not be on y=7 at turn 97.\n\nSo at turn 96, we must be at y=6, and at turn 97, we do not go to y=7, so we stay or go down, but go down not allowed, so stay at y=6.\n\nThen turn97: y=6\n\nThen a97=U, turn98: y=7, unsafe.\n\nOr if we go down, but we can't, since no down actions.\n\nAnother idea: to be on y=7 at turn 99.\n\nBut as before, if y99=7, then we can go to y=8 at turn100, but not 9.\n\nUnless we have an action to go up again, but no.\n\nSo for H=10, we cannot reach y=9 if we are at y=7 at turn99.\n\nThe only way to avoid y=7 at 96-98 is to be below or above at those turns.\n\nAbove: at turn 96, if we are on y=8, for example.\n\nBut to be on y=8 at turn 96, y96 = sum_{i=90}^{95} a_i <=6, impossible.\n\nMax y96=6 with all up.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 97, max y97=7.\n\nAt turn 98, max y98=8.\n\nSo at turn 96, we can be at most y=6.\n\nAt turn 97, at most y=7.\n\nAt turn 98, at most y=8.\n\nSo at turn 96, we are at y<=6, so not above 7.\n\nAt turn 97, y<=7, so to not be on 7, we must be at y<7, so y<=6.\n\nSimilarly at turn 98, y<=8, to not be on 7, we must be at y!=7, so y<=6 or y=8.\n\nBut y=8 at turn 98 is possible if we have 8 up in first 8 actions.\n\ny98 = sum_{i=90}^{97} a_i\n\nWith 8 actions, max 8, so y98=8 possible with all up.\n\nThen at turn 98, y=8, not 7, safe.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 97, y=7 or less.\n\nBut if we can have y97<=6, then at turn 97 not on 7.\n\nSimilarly at turn 96, y<=6, always, so not on 7.\n\nSo the key is to not be on y=7 at turn 97, since at turn 96 and 98 we can avoid by position.\n\nAt turn 96, we are always at y<=6, so not on 7.\n\nAt turn 98, we can be at y=8.\n\nAt turn 97, we can be at y<=6 or y=7.\n\nTo avoid, we need y97 <=6 or y97=7 but not at turn 97, but we are at turn 97.\n\nSo we need y97 <=6.\n\nSimilarly, for turn 96 and 98, no issue.\n\nSo for turn 97, we need to be at y<=6.\n\nThen at turn 98, we can be at y=7 or 8, but if at y=7, unsafe at T=98, so we must not be on y=7 at turn 98, so at turn 98, we need y=8 or less, but if y=7, unsafe, so y!=7, so y<=6 or y=8.\n\nBut since we need to reach 9, better to be high.\n\nSo let's set y97 <=6.\n\nThen at turn 97, y<=6, safe from y=7 collision.\n\nThen at turn 98, we want y=8 to avoid y=7 and to progress.\n\ny98 = y97 + a97\n\nIf y97 <=6, and a97=U, then y98 = y97+1 <=7\n\nIf y97=6, y98=7\n\nIf y97=5, y98=6, etc.\n\nTo have y98=8, we need y97=7 and a97=U, but y97=7 is what we are avoiding.\n\nContradiction.\n\ny98 = y97 + a97\n\nIf y97 <=6, then y98 <=7\n\nCannot be 8.\n\nSo at turn 98, y98 <=7 if y97<=6.\n\nAnd since y98 cannot be 8, and to avoid y=7, we need y98 <=6 or y98=8, but y98<=7, so y98<=6 to avoid 7.\n\nThen at turn 99, y99 = y98 + a98 <=7, and so on, we fall behind.\n\nFor example, if y97=6, then a97=U, y98=7, but at turn 98 y=7 unsafe.\n\na97=S, y98=6, then a98=U, y99=7, then a99=U, y100=8<9.\n\nNot 9.\n\na98=U, y99=7, a99=U, y100=8, still not 9.\n\nTo reach y=9 at turn100, we need y99 + a99 =9, so y99 must be 8 or 9.\n\nIf y99=8, a99=U, y100=9.\n\nIf y99=9, a99=S, y100=9.\n\nSo y99 >=8.\n\nBut if y97<=6, then y98 = y97 + a97 <=7\n\nThen y99 = y98 + a98 <=8\n\nIf y98=7, y99=8 with a98=U\n\nOr y98=6, y99=7 with a98=U, then y99=7, a99=U, y100=8<9, not.\n\nSo only if y98=7, then a98=U, y99=8, then a99=U, y100=9.\n\nBut at turn 98, if y98=7, and T=98, unsafe for y=7.\n\nCollision.\n\nIf y98=6, then y99<=7, y100<=8<9.\n\nSo impossible to reach y=9 at turn100 if we have y97<=6 or similar constraint.\n\nTherefore, for H=10, it is impossible to avoid the collision or to reach the goal.\n\nWe need H>10.\n\nTry H=11.\n\nThen at turn 100, y=9? Turn 90+H, for H=11, turn 101.\n\ny_101=9.\n\nWith 11 actions, U - D =9, U+D+S=11.\n\nThen (U-D) +2D +S =9 +2D +S=11, so 2D+S=2.\n\nPossibilities: D=0, S=2; D=1, S=0; or D=1, S=0 and something, cases:\n\n- D=0, S=2: 9 up, 2 stay\n\n- D=1, S=1: 10 up, 1 down, net U-D=9, U+D+S=11, U-D=9, U+D+S=11, add: 2U +S =20, subtract: 2D +S=2.\n\nSo if D=0, S=2, U=9\n\nIf D=1, S=0, U=10\n\nIf D=1, S=1, U=10, then U-D=9, U+D+S=10+1+1=12>11, not.\n\nU+D+S=11.\n\nIf D=1, S=1, U=10, then U+D+S=10+1+1=12>11, impossible.\n\nD=1, S=0, U=10, U+D+S=10+1+0=11, U-D=9.\n\nD=0, S=2, U=9, U+D+S=9+0+2=11, U-D=9.\n\nOr D=2, S=0, U=11, U-D=9, U+D+S=11+2+0=13>11, no.\n\nSo only two cases: 10 up and 1 down, or 9 up and 2 stay.\n\nNow, to min H, H=11, larger than 10, but we might find a way.\n\nFirst, try with 10 up and 1 down.\n\nThen we can go down once and up more.\n\nFor example, go down to avoid the unsafe spot.\n\nLet's list the turns from 90 to 101.\n\nUnsafe times: y=7 unsafe at 96,97,98.\n\nWe can be on y=7 at other times.\n\nFor example, at turn 95, but y95<=5, impossible.\n\nTurn 99: possible.\n\nWith 11 actions, we can reach later.\n\nSuppose we want to be on y=7 at turn 99.\n\ny99 = sum_{i=90}^{98} a_i\n\nWith 9 actions from 90 to 98, max y99=9, min -9.\n\nCan be 7.\n\nThen at turn 99, y=7, safe.\n\nThen we can go up to y=8 at turn100, then to y=9 at turn101.\n\nBut let's see if we can avoid the collision.\n\nAlso, we have other constraints like y=3,4,5 at T=91,92.\n\nBut those are early, we can be later.\n\nLet's construct a path.\n\nStart turn 90 y=0.\n\nSuppose we do some actions to be slow at first, so that when we reach y=7, it is after turn 98.\n\nFor example, stay at turn 90 and turn 91 or something.\n\nBut let's calculate.\n\nWe need y101=9.\n\nWith 10 U and 1 D, or 9 U and 2 S.\n\nFirst, with 9 U and 2 S.\n\nThen we can stay twice.\n\nFor example, stay at turn 90 and turn 91.\n\nThen turn91: y=0\n\nturn92: y=0\n\nThen a92=U, turn93: y=1\n\na93=U, turn94: y=2\n\na94=U, turn95: y=3\n\na95=U, turn96: y=4\n\na96=U, turn97: y=5\n\na97=U, turn98: y=6\n\na98=U, turn99: y=7  // T=99 safe for y=7\n\na99=U, turn100: y=8\n\na100=U, turn101: y=9\n\nAt turn99 y=7, T=99 not 96-98, so safe.\n\nAnd no collision at other points.\n\nCheck other turns.\n\nTurn91: y=0, not freeway, safe.\n\nTurn92: y=0, safe.\n\nTurn93: y=1, freeway 1, safe at T=93.\n\nTurn94: y=2, freeway 2, safe.\n\nTurn95: y=3, freeway 3, unsafe at T=91,92, but T=95 safe.\n\nTurn96: y=4, freeway 4, similarly safe.\n\nTurn97: y=5, freeway 5, safe.\n\nTurn98: y=6, freeway 6, unsafe only at T=92, T=98 safe.\n\nTurn99: y=7, freeway 7, unsafe at 96,97,98, T=99 safe.\n\nTurn100: y=8, freeway 8, unsafe at 102+, T=100 safe.\n\nTurn101: y=9, safe.\n\nAnd we reach at turn101.\n\nH=11 turns.\n\nBut is this minimal? Earlier H=9 and H=10 not possible, so H=11 might be minimal.\n\nBut we can do with 10 U and 1 D.\n\nFor example, go down once to avoid.\n\nBut let's see if we can do H=10 with down.\n\nEarlier for H=10, we had U-D=9, U+D+S=10, so 2D+S=1, so D=0 or D=1 and S= -1 impossible, so only D=0, S=1, no down.\n\nFor H=10, no down possible, only stay.\n\nBut we couldn't find a way.\n\nSo H=11 with 9 up and 2 stay.\n\nIn the path above, we stayed at turn 90 and 91? In the sequence, I stayed at turn 90 and 91, but turn 90 and 91 are actions.\n\nLet's list the actions.\n\nTurn 90: action S (stay), so y91 = y90 +0 =0\n\nTurn 91: action S (stay), y92 =0\n\nTurn 92: action U, y93=1\n\nTurn 93: action U, y94=2\n\nTurn 94: action U, y95=3\n\nTurn 95: action U, y96=4\n\nTurn 96: action U, y97=5\n\nTurn 97: action U, y98=6\n\nTurn 98: action U, y99=7\n\nTurn 99: action U, y100=8\n\nTurn 100: action U, y101=9\n\nAt turn 100, y=8, then a100=U, turn101 y=9.\n\nActions from turn 90 to turn 100, 11 actions, to reach turn101.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 99, y=7, which is safe.\n\nAnd we avoided the unsafe turns for y=7.\n\nNow, are there any other issues? For example, at turn 95, y=3, freeway 3, but unsafe only at 90,91,92, T=95 safe.\n\nSimilarly all good.\n\nBut is there a shorter path?\n\nPerhaps with one down, we can do H=10.\n\nFor H=10, with down, but earlier we saw for H=10, U-D=9, U+D+S=10, so 2D+S=1, impossible since D and S integers, 2D+S=1, if D=0, S=1; if D=1, S=-1 impossible. So no down possible for H=10. Only stay.\n\nAnd with stay, we couldn't avoid collision.\n\nSo H=11 is minimal.\n\nBut let's confirm if we can do with H=10 by choosing different stay point.\n\nSuppose we stay at turn 97, but if we are on y=7 at turn 97, stay would keep us there, collision.\n\nIf at turn 96, we are at y=6, and we stay, then turn97 y=6, not 7, good.\n\nThen at turn97 y=6, safe.\n\nThen a97=U, turn98 y=7, but T=98 unsafe for y=7.\n\nCollision.\n\nIf at turn 96, we go down, but we can't for H=10.\n\nSo impossible.\n\nThus H=11 with the sequence above.\n\nIn the sequence, we have two stays at the beginning.\n\nBut we can have stays elsewhere.\n\nFor example, stay at turn 95 and 96 or something, but in this case, it works.\n\nNow, the car on y=6 at T=92, but we are not on y=6 at T=92, so no issue.\n\nSimilarly, all fine.\n\nSo minimal H=11.\n\nNow, the sequence of actions.\n\nStart at turn 90, position (0,0)\n\nWe need actions from turn 90 to turn 100, 11 actions.\n\nIn the path:\n\nTurn 90: action S (stay, so y91=0)\n\nTurn 91: action S (stay, y92=0)\n\nTurn 92: action U (up, y93=1)\n\nTurn 93: action U (y94=2)\n\nTurn 94: action U (y95=3)\n\nTurn 95: action U (y96=4)\n\nTurn 96: action U (y97=5)\n\nTurn 97: action U (y98=6)\n\nTurn 98: action U (y99=7)\n\nTurn 99: action U (y100=8)\n\nTurn 100: action U (y101=9)\n\nAt turn 101, y=9, reached.\n\nNow, in terms of the answer, we need to output the actions from turn 90 to turn 90+H-1, but H=11, so actions at t=90 to t=100.\n\nIn the sequence above, actions at turn 90 to 100.\n\nNow, to write the answer.\n\nBut let's confirm the collision points again.\n\nAt turn 99, y=7, freeway 7, turn T=99.\n\nIs it unsafe? y=7 unsafe at T=96,97,98, not 99, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\ny=3 at turn 95: T=95, unsafe times 90,91,92, so safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nPerhaps we can have only one stay if we use a down, but for H=11, with down might be faster? No, H=11 same.\n\nBut with 10U and 1D, we can have H=11.\n\nFor example, go up fast to y=6, then down to avoid, but let's see.\n\nStart: turn90 y=0\n\na90=U, turn91 y=1\n\na91=U, turn92 y=2\n\na92=U, turn93 y=3\n\nBut at turn93, y=3, T=93, safe, since unsafe only 91,92? T=91,92 for y=3.\n\nT=93 safe.\n\na93=U, turn94 y=4\n\na94=U, turn95 y=5\n\na95=U, turn96 y=6\n\nNow at turn96 y=6, safe.\n\nThen to avoid y=7 at 97, we can go down.\n\na96=D, down, turn97 y=5\n\nThen at turn97 y=5, freeway 5, safe (unsafe only 91,92)\n\nThen a97=U, turn98 y=6\n\na98=U, turn99 y=7 // but T=99 safe for y=7\n\na99=U, turn100 y=8\n\na100=U, turn101 y=9\n\nBut y101=9, same as before, H=11.\n\nBut at turn99 y=7, safe.\n\nIn this case, we used one down at turn96.\n\nBut H still 11.\n\nWith 9U and 2S, also H=11.\n\nBut in the first sequence with two stays, we have fewer up moves, but same turns.\n\nSince we want min turns, H=11 is fine.\n\nNow, to output the actions.\n\nIn the first sequence, we stayed at turn90 and 91.\n\nBut we can stay at other points, but it should be ok.\n\nNow, the answer should be the sequence.\n\nBut let's write from turn 90.\n\nCurrent turn is t1=90.\n\nWe need actions for turn 90 to turn 90+H-1, with H=11, so to turn 100.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 90: S\n\nTurn 91: S\n\nTurn 92: U\n\nTurn 93: U\n\nTurn 94: U\n\nTurn 95: U\n\nTurn 96: U\n\nTurn 97: U\n\nTurn 98: U\n\nTurn 99: U\n\nTurn 100: U\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 100, action U, to go to y=9 at turn 101.\n\nBut turn 101 is turn 90 + 11.\n\nNow, in the boxed answer.\n\nBut we need to specify the actions.\n\nPerhaps we can start going up immediately but stay later to delay y=7.\n\nFor example, stay at turn 97 and 98 or something, but let's not bother.\n\nThe sequence works.\n\nTo minimize H, but H=11 seems min.\n\nAnother thought: can we reach by turn 100 with H=10? We concluded no.\n\nPerhaps with different path, like going to higher y earlier, but y=8 unsafe at 102+, but we can be there early.\n\nBut in the direct path, we cannot avoid y=7 at bad times with H=10.\n\nSo I think H=11 is min.\n\nNow for the answer.\n\nIn the sequence, we have two S at beginning, but we can have one S and one D, but not necessary.\n\nIn the output format, we need to list actions from turn t1.\n\nSo for turn 90: action\n\nTurn 91: action\n\n...\n\nUp to turn 100.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nTurn 90: S (since we stay, y remains 0)\n\nTurn 91: S (y remains 0)\n\nTurn 92: U (y=1 at turn 93)\n\nTurn 93: U (y=2 at turn 94)\n\n...\n\nLet's list the position and action clearly.\n\nAt turn 90: position y=0, we choose action for this turn.\n\nAfter action, at turn 91, new position.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\n- At turn 90, choose S, so Δy=0, so at turn 91, y=0\n\n- At turn 91, choose S, so at turn 92, y=0\n\n- At turn 92, choose U, so at turn 93, y=1\n\n- At turn 93, choose U, so at turn 94, y=2\n\n- At turn 94, choose U, so at turn 95, y=3\n\n- At turn 95, choose U, so at turn 96, y=4\n\n- At turn 96, choose U, so at turn 97, y=5\n\n- At turn 97, choose U, so at turn 98, y=6\n\n- At turn 98, choose U, so at turn 99, y=7\n\n- At turn 99, choose U, so at turn 100, y=8\n\n- At turn 100, choose U, so at turn 101, y=9\n\nReached at turn 101.\n\nIn the action list, we have 11 actions.\n\nThe minimal H is 11.\n\nTo write the answer.\n\nThe sequence of actions: for turn 90 to turn 100.\n\nIn the boxed format.\n\nPerhaps we can have a shorter sequence by going down, but same H.\n\nI think this is fine.\n\nSo the actions are:\n\nTurn 90: S\n\nTurn 91: S\n\nTurn 92: U\n\nTurn 93: U\n\nTurn 94: U\n\nTurn 95: U\n\nTurn 96: U\n\nTurn 97: U\n\nTurn 98: U\n\nTurn 99: U\n\nTurn 100: U\n\nBut at turn 100, action U, to reach at turn 101.\n\nIn the sequence, we need to specify until the action that leads to the position.\n\nBut in the answer, it should be clear.\n\nNow, for the car on freeway 7, we have cars, but in this path, we are on y=7 only at turn 99, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nPerhaps we can start going up immediately and stay later.\n\nFor example, go up to y=5, then stay, then continue.\n\nBut let's see if we can have H=11 with different actions.\n\nBut not necessary.\n\nSo I think this works.\n</think>\nTo reach the position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 90\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 11. This requires a sequence of actions that includes 9 up moves (U) and 2 stay actions (S) to delay the progression and avoid being on freeway \\(y = 7\\) during turns 96, 97, and 98, when it is unsafe due to car positions.\n\nThe unsafe times for each freeway are:\n- Freeways \\(y = 3, 4, 5\\): unsafe at turns 90, 91, 92\n- Freeway \\(y = 6\\): unsafe only at turn 92\n- Freeway \\(y = 7\\): unsafe at turns 96, 97, 98\n- Freeways \\(y = 1, 2, 8\\): unsafe at turns 102, 103, 104 (but these are beyond the path to turn 101)\n\nThe sequence of actions ensures that:\n- The player stays at \\(y = 0\\) for turns 91 and 92 by using stay actions at turns 90 and 91, avoiding early unsafe freeways.\n- The player progresses upward starting from turn 92, reaching \\(y = 7\\) at turn 99 (safe, as turn 99 is not unsafe for \\(y = 7\\)).\n- The player reaches \\(y = 9\\) at turn 101 after 11 actions.\n\nThe action sequence is as follows:\n\n- At turn 90, action S: stay at \\(y = 0\\), so position at turn 91 is \\((0, 0)\\) (safe, no freeway).\n- At turn 91, action S: stay at \\(y = 0\\), so position at turn 92 is \\((0, 0)\\) (safe, no freeway).\n- At turn 92, action U: move up to \\(y = 1\\), so position at turn 93 is \\((0, 1)\\) (freeway 1 safe at turn 93).\n- At turn 93, action U: move up to \\(y = 2\\), so position at turn 94 is \\((0, 2)\\) (freeway 2 safe at turn 94).\n- At turn 94, action U: move up to \\(y = 3\\), so position at turn 95 is \\((0, 3)\\) (freeway 3 safe at turn 95, as unsafe only at 90-92).\n- At turn 95, action U: move up to \\(y = 4\\), so position at turn 96 is \\((0, 4)\\) (freeway 4 safe at turn 96, as unsafe only at 90-92).\n- At turn 96, action U: move up to \\(y = 5\\), so position at turn 97 is \\((0, 5)\\) (freeway 5 safe at turn 97, as unsafe only at 90-92).\n- At turn 97, action U: move up to \\(y = 6\\), so position at turn 98 is \\((0, 6)\\) (freeway 6 safe at turn 98, as unsafe only at turn 92).\n- At turn 98, action U: move up to \\(y = 7\\), so position at turn 99 is \\((0, 7)\\) (freeway 7 safe at turn 99, as unsafe only at 96-98).\n- At turn 99, action U: move up to \\(y = 8\\), so position at turn 100 is \\((0, 8)\\) (freeway 8 safe at turn 100, as unsafe only at 102+).\n- At turn 100, action U: move up to \\(y = 9\\), so position at turn 101 is \\((0, 9)\\) (goal reached, no freeway).\n\nThis sequence achieves the goal in 11 turns (from turn 90 to turn 100, with position reached at turn 101), and it is minimal since sequences with \\(H = 9\\) or \\(H = 10\\) result in collisions or cannot reach \\(y = 9\\) within the turn limit.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 90: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 91: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 92: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 93: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 94: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 95: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 96: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 97: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 98: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 99: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 100: U \\end{array} }",
