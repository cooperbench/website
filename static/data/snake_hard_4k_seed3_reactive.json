        "thinking": "### Understanding the Problem\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario presented:\n\n1. **Game Grid**: It's an 8x8 grid (since x and y range from 0 to 7).\n2. **Snake**: Currently, the snake has only one segment at position (3, 3), which is both its head and tail since its length is 1. The head is currently moving left (L).\n3. **Walls**: \n   - Border walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.\n   - Internal obstacles are at: (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4), (3,4), (2,2), (3,6).\n4. **Food**: \n   - (5,6): value=10, life_span=1\n   - (5,1): value=10, life_span=1\n   - (4,3): value=10, life_span=1\n\n### Initial Observations\n\n- Since the snake's length is 1, it can move in any direction except the opposite of its current direction (which is left, so it cannot immediately move right).\n- The available moves from (3,3) are:\n  - Up (U): (3,4)\n  - Down (D): (3,2)\n  - Left (L): (2,3)\n  - Right (R): (4,3) — but this is opposite to current direction, so invalid.\n\nHowever, we must also consider walls and obstacles:\n- Up to (3,4): There's an internal obstacle at (3,4), so this is invalid.\n- Down to (3,2): No walls or obstacles here.\n- Left to (2,3): No walls or obstacles here.\n\nSo, valid moves are Down (D) and Left (L).\n\n### Evaluating Food Options\n\nNow, let's look at the food positions relative to the snake's current position (3,3):\n\n1. (5,6): This is two cells to the right and three cells up. Not adjacent, so not immediately reachable.\n2. (5,1): Two cells to the right and two cells down. Not adjacent.\n3. (4,3): One cell to the right. But moving right is invalid (opposite direction), and even if it were allowed, the snake cannot eat food under its body unless it moves away first. Since the snake is only one segment long, moving away isn't possible here.\n\n### Possible Moves Analysis\n\nGiven the valid moves are D and L:\n\n1. **Left (L) to (2,3)**:\n   - New head position: (2,3)\n   - Check for food: No food at (2,3).\n   - Check for collisions: No walls or obstacles at (2,3).\n   - After moving, the tail would also move to (2,3), but since the snake is length 1, this is just the head moving.\n\n2. **Down (D) to (3,2)**:\n   - New head position: (3,2)\n   - Check for food: No food at (3,2).\n   - Check for collisions: No walls or obstacles at (3,2).\n\nNeither move leads directly to food, but both are safe.\n\n### Considering Future Moves\n\nSince both moves are safe and don't lead to immediate food, I might consider which move positions the snake better for future food collection.\n\n- Moving Left to (2,3):\n  - Next possible moves from (2,3):\n    - U: (2,4) — obstacle at (2,4), invalid.\n    - D: (2,2) — obstacle at (2,2), invalid.\n    - L: (1,3) — no obstacle.\n    - R: (3,3) — opposite of current move (L), invalid next turn.\n  - So, only L is valid next turn, leading to (1,3).\n\n- Moving Down to (3,2):\n  - Next possible moves from (3,2):\n    - U: (3,3) — opposite of current move (D), invalid next turn.\n    - D: (3,1) — obstacle at (3,1), invalid.\n    - L: (2,2) — obstacle at (2,2), invalid.\n    - R: (4,3) — valid.\n  - So, only R is valid next turn, leading to (4,3), where there's food.\n\n### Decision Making\n\nMoving Down (D) to (3,2) sets up the next move to Right (R) to (4,3), where there's positive food with value 10. This seems like a better path to eventually reach food compared to moving Left, which would limit future moves.\n\nHowever, we must ensure that eating the food at (4,3) is safe:\n- After moving to (4,3), the snake's length increases to 2, with head at (4,3) and tail at (3,2).\n- The tail is at (3,2), and the food is at (4,3), so no immediate danger from \"Tail Reward Danger\" since the tail is not adjacent to the head after eating.\n\n### Verifying Safety\n\nLet's simulate the sequence:\n\n1. Turn 0: Move D to (3,2). Snake: [(3,2)].\n2. Turn 1: Move R to (4,3). Snake: [(4,3), (3,2)].\n   - Now, head is at (4,3), which has food (value=10, life_span=1).\n   - Eating increases length to 2, so new snake: [(4,3), (3,2)] (same positions, but now length is 2).\n   - Next moves from (4,3):\n     - U: (4,4) — no obstacle.\n     - D: (4,2) — no obstacle.\n     - L: (3,3) — no obstacle, but opposite of R, so invalid next turn.\n     - R: (5,3) — no obstacle.\n   - Valid next moves: U, D, R.\n\nThis seems safe and leads to food consumption.\n\n### Alternative Path: Moving Left First\n\nFor completeness, let's see what happens if we move Left first:\n\n1. Turn 0: Move L to (2,3). Snake: [(2,3)].\n2. Turn 1: Must move L (only valid move) to (1,3). Snake: [(1,3)].\n   - Now, no immediate food access, and limited movement options.\n\nThis path doesn't lead to food quickly and limits movement, making it less optimal.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nMoving Down (D) at Turn 0 sets up a path to reach the food at (4,3) on the next turn, which is the most efficient way to increase the snake's length and score in this scenario.\n\n\\boxed{D}",

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Problem\n\nFirst, I need to understand the current state of the Snake game based on the provided information. Here's what's given:\n\n- **Current Turn (t₀)**: 1\n- **Walls**:\n  - **Border Cells**: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (meaning the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7))\n  - **Internal Obstacles**: [(3, 1), (2, 4), (1, 1), (1, 6), (6, 4), (3, 4), (2, 2), (3, 6)]\n- **Snake Positions**: [(3, 2)] \n  - This means the snake has only a head at (3,2) and no body segments (length = 1).\n- **Snake Head Direction**: D (Down)\n- **Food Items**:\n  1. (5, 6, 9, 1) → Position (5,6), value 9, life span 1\n  2. (5, 1, 9, 1) → Position (5,1), value 9, life span 1\n  3. (4, 3, 9, 1) → Position (4,3), value 9, life span 1\n  4. (4, 6, 10, 1) → Position (4,6), value 10, life span 1\n\n### Initial Observations\n\n1. **Snake Length**: The snake is only 1 unit long (just the head). This means:\n   - No body segments to collide with.\n   - The \"Tail Reward Danger\" rule doesn't apply because there's no tail adjacent to the head.\n\n2. **Current Direction**: The snake is moving Down (D). \n   - From the rules: \"No instant reverse\" means I cannot choose Up (U) as the next move because it's the opposite of Down.\n\n3. **Possible Moves**: From (3,2), moving Down would go to (3,1). Other possible moves:\n   - Left (L): (2,2)\n   - Right (R): (4,2)\n   - Down (D): (3,1)\n   - Up (U): (3,3) but this is illegal because it's the reverse of current direction D.\n\n4. **Wall and Obstacle Checks**:\n   - **Down (D) to (3,1)**:\n     - Check walls: y=0 is a wall, but (3,1) is y=1, so not a border wall.\n     - Check internal obstacles: (3,1) is in the list of internal obstacles → cannot move here.\n   - **Left (L) to (2,2)**:\n     - Not a border wall (x=0 is wall, but x=2 is not).\n     - Internal obstacles: (2,2) is in the list → cannot move here.\n   - **Right (R) to (4,2)**:\n     - Not a border wall.\n     - Internal obstacles: (4,2) is not listed → valid move.\n   - **Up (U) to (3,3)**:\n     - Illegal because it's the reverse direction.\n\nSo, the only legal move is **Right (R) to (4,2)**.\n\nBut wait, let's check if there's any food at (4,2). Looking at the food positions:\n- (5,6), (5,1), (4,3), (4,6) → (4,2) is not listed, so no food there.\n\n### Evaluating Food Options\n\nEven though (4,2) is the only legal move, let's see if any food is reachable in the next steps to plan ahead, though the task is to decide the immediate action.\n\nThe closest foods are:\n1. (4,3) - value 9, life span 1\n   - Distance: from (3,2) to (4,3) is |3-4| + |2-3| = 1 + 1 = 2 (Manhattan distance)\n   - To reach (4,3) from (3,2):\n     - First move: Right to (4,2)\n     - Second move: Up to (4,3)\n   - But life span is 1, so it will disappear after this turn (since countdown decreases every turn including current). So at turn 1, life span is 1; after turn 1, it's 0 → gone by turn 2. So cannot reach it in time.\n\n2. (5,1) - value 9, life span 1\n   - Distance: |3-5| + |2-1| = 2 + 1 = 3\n   - Life span 1 → cannot reach in time.\n\n3. (5,6) - value 9, life span 1\n   - Distance: |3-5| + |2-6| = 2 + 4 = 6\n   - Life span 1 → cannot reach.\n\n4. (4,6) - value 10, life span 1\n   - Distance: |3-4| + |2-6| = 1 + 4 = 5\n   - Life span 1 → cannot reach.\n\n### Conclusion on Immediate Action\n\nSince all foods have life span 1 and cannot be reached in this turn, the immediate goal is to avoid collisions and stay alive. The only legal move is Right (R) to (4,2).\n\n### Verifying No Immediate Danger\n\n- Moving to (4,2):\n  - Not a wall or obstacle.\n  - Snake has no body segments, so no collision risk.\n  - No food at (4,2), so no eating happens.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe only possible and safe move is **Right (R)**.\n\n\\boxed{R}",

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Problem\n\nFirst, I need to understand the game state and the rules thoroughly.\n\n**Game State at Turn \\( t_0 = 2 \\):**\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The grid seems to be 8x8 (since x and y range from 0 to 7).\n2. **Walls**:\n   - Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (meaning the snake cannot move outside these bounds).\n   - Internal obstacles: There are several internal walls at specific coordinates like (3,1), (2,4), etc.\n3. **Snake**:\n   - Positions: Only one segment at (4,2), which means the snake is of length 1 (just the head).\n   - Current direction: Right (R).\n4. **Food**:\n   - There are four food items with their positions, life spans, and values:\n     - (5,6): value=1, life_span=8\n     - (5,1): value=1, life_span=8\n     - (4,3): value=1, life_span=8\n     - (4,6): value=1, life_span=9\n\n**Rules Recap**:\n\n1. **Movement**:\n   - Can move Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R).\n   - Cannot reverse direction immediately (since current direction is R, cannot move L next).\n2. **Food**:\n   - All foods here are positive (value=1).\n   - Eating increases length by 1 and score by 1.\n   - Food under the snake's body can only be eaten if the body moves away and the head moves onto it.\n   - Tail Reward Danger: If head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake (but snake length is 1 now, so no tail).\n3. **Collisions**:\n   - Walls and body segments are deadly.\n   - Since the snake is length 1, only walls are a concern for collision.\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nCurrent direction is R (Right). From (4,2), possible moves are:\n\n1. **Right (R)**: (5,2)\n   - Check if (5,2) is valid:\n     - Not a wall: Looking at internal obstacles, (5,2) is not listed.\n     - Not a border: x=5 is within 0-7, y=2 is within 0-7.\n     - No food at (5,2) in the given list.\n   - So, moving R is safe but doesn't eat food.\n2. **Up (U)**: (4,3)\n   - (4,3) has food with value=1, life_span=8.\n   - Check if (4,3) is valid:\n     - Not a wall: (4,3) is not in the internal obstacles.\n     - Not a border: x=4, y=3 are within bounds.\n   - Moving U would eat the food at (4,3), increasing length to 2.\n   - Is this safe? Since length is 1, no body collision risk.\n3. **Down (D)**: (4,1)\n   - Check (4,1):\n     - Internal obstacles include (1,1), (3,1), but not (4,1).\n     - Not a border.\n     - No food at (4,1).\n   - Safe but no food.\n4. **Left (L)**: (3,2)\n   - Current direction is R, so moving L is opposite (reverse), which is not allowed.\n   - So, cannot move L.\n\n### Evaluating Moves\n\nPossible valid moves: R, U, D.\n\n1. **Move R (Right) to (5,2)**:\n   - Safe, but no immediate reward.\n   - Future prospects: From (5,2), can move towards other foods like (5,1) or (5,6).\n2. **Move U (Up) to (4,3)**:\n   - Eats food at (4,3), length becomes 2.\n   - Immediate reward +1.\n   - After eating, next head position is (4,3), body is [(4,3), (4,2)].\n   - Next moves would need to avoid moving back to (4,2) unless the tail moves.\n3. **Move D (Down) to (4,1)**:\n   - Safe, no reward.\n   - From (4,1), can consider moving towards (5,1) next.\n\n**Priority**: Eating food is beneficial unless it leads to immediate danger. Here, eating at (4,3) is safe and increases length.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Dangers After Eating\n\nIf we move U to (4,3):\n- New snake positions: [(4,3), (4,2)].\n- Next turn, cannot reverse direction (from U, cannot move D immediately).\n- Possible next moves from (4,3):\n  - U: (4,4) - check if valid:\n    - Not a wall: (4,4) is not in internal obstacles.\n    - No food at (4,4) in current list.\n  - L: (3,3) - valid:\n    - Not a wall.\n    - No food.\n  - R: (5,3) - valid:\n    - Not a wall.\n    - No food.\n  - D: Not allowed (reverse).\n  \nNo immediate danger after eating.\n\n### Comparing with Other Foods\n\nOther foods:\n- (5,6): Far from current position (4,2), distance |5-4| + |6-2| = 1 + 4 = 5.\n- (5,1): Distance |5-4| + |1-2| = 1 + 1 = 2.\n- (4,6): Distance |4-4| + |6-2| = 0 + 4 = 4.\n- (4,3): Distance |4-4| + |3-2| = 0 + 1 = 1 (closest).\n\nEating the closest food seems optimal to minimize risk and maximize score over time.\n\n### Potential Risks\n\n- Moving towards (5,1) next after (4,1) is possible but requires two moves (D then R or L), whereas (4,3) is immediate.\n- No immediate collision risks in any move except L which is invalid.\n\n### Decision\n\nBest immediate action is to move Up (U) to eat the food at (4,3), gaining +1 score and increasing length safely.\n\n\\boxed{U}",

So, the snake cannot move to any cell where x or y is 0 or 7.\n   - **Internal Obstacles**: There are several internal walls at specific coordinates: (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4), (3,4), (2,2), (3,6).\n3. **Snake**:\n   - **Positions**: The snake has two segments: head at (4,3) and body at (4,2).\n   - **Direction**: The head is currently moving \"Up\" (U), meaning it moved from (4,2) to (4,3) in the last move.\n4. **Food**:\n   - There are three food items:\n     - (5,6): value = 1, life_span = 7\n     - (5,1): value = 1, life_span = 7\n     - (4,6): value = 1, life_span = 8\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However, there are constraints:\n\n1. **No Instant Reverse**: Since the current direction is U, the snake cannot move D (opposite direction) in the next turn.\n   - So, possible moves: U, L, R.\n\n2. **Wall and Obstacle Collision**: The snake cannot move into a cell that's a wall or an obstacle.\n   - Current head position: (4,3)\n   - Possible moves from (4,3):\n     - U: (4,4) → Check if this is a wall or obstacle.\n     - L: (3,3) → Check.\n     - R: (5,3) → Check.\n\nLet's check each:\n\n- **U: (4,4)**:\n  - Border walls: y=7 is the top border, y=0 is bottom. y=4 is not a border.\n  - Internal obstacles: Check if (4,4) is in the list. The list is [(3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4), (3,4), (2,2), (3,6)]. (4,4) is not there.\n  - So, (4,4) is free.\n\n- **L: (3,3)**:\n  - Not a border wall.\n  - Internal obstacles: (3,1), (3,4), (3,6) are present. (3,3) is not listed.\n  - So, (3,3) is free.\n\n- **R: (5,3)**:\n  - Not a border wall.\n  - Internal obstacles: None at (5,3).\n  - So, (5,3) is free.\n\nSo, possible moves: U, L, R.\n\n### Checking for Food\n\nNow, let's see if any of these moves lead to food:\n\n1. **U: (4,4)**:\n   - Food positions: (5,6), (5,1), (4,6). (4,4) is not a food position.\n   - So, no food here.\n\n2. **L: (3,3)**:\n   - Not a food position.\n\n3. **R: (5,3)**:\n   - Not a food position.\n\nNone of the immediate moves lead directly to food. So, the goal is to choose a move that positions the snake to reach food in the future while avoiding collisions.\n\n### Avoiding Collisions\n\nWe also need to ensure that the move doesn't lead to a collision with the snake's own body or walls (already checked walls).\n\nCurrent snake body: [(4,3), (4,2)].\n\nAfter any move, the body will move to [(new head), (4,3)], and the tail at (4,2) will disappear (since the snake length doesn't change unless it eats food).\n\nSo, for each move:\n\n1. **U: (4,4)**:\n   - New positions: [(4,4), (4,3)].\n   - No overlap between head and body.\n\n2. **L: (3,3)**:\n   - New positions: [(3,3), (4,3)].\n   - No overlap.\n\n3. **R: (5,3)**:\n   - New positions: [(5,3), (4,3)].\n   - No overlap.\n\nAll moves are safe in terms of body collision.\n\n### Considering Future Moves\n\nSince no immediate food is available, we should choose a move that brings us closer to food or keeps options open.\n\nLooking at food positions:\n\n1. (5,6): Far from current head (4,3).\n2. (5,1): Below current head.\n3. (4,6): Above current head.\n\nTo reach (4,6), moving U seems beneficial, as it's in the same column.\n\nCurrent head: (4,3). (4,6) is at y=6, so need to move up by 3.\n\nAfter U to (4,4), next moves could be U to (4,5), then U to (4,6).\n\nBut we need to check obstacles:\n\n- (4,4): free.\n- (4,5): Check if it's free.\n  - Not a border wall.\n  - Internal obstacles: (4,5) is not listed.\n  - So, free.\n- (4,6): \n  - Not a border wall.\n  - Internal obstacles: (3,6) is present, but (4,6) is not listed.\n  - So, free.\n\nSo, path to (4,6): U, U, U.\n\nAlternative paths:\n\n- First R to (5,3), then U to (5,4), then U to (5,5), then U to (5,6). But (5,6) is also food, but longer path.\n\n- First L to (3,3), then... seems to go away from both foods.\n\nThus, moving U seems the most direct path to food (4,6).\n\n### Checking Tail Reward Danger\n\nThere's a special rule about \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake.\n\nCurrent tail is at (4,2). Adjacent cells to tail: (4,1), (3,2), (5,2), (4,3).\n\nHead is at (4,3), which is adjacent to tail (4,2).\n\nIs there food at (4,2)? No, the food positions are at (5,6), (5,1), (4,6). So no danger here.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe best immediate move is U, as it starts the snake on a path towards the food at (4,6) without any immediate dangers.\n\n\\boxed{U}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The grid is 8x8 (from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7).\n2. **Walls**:\n   - Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (can't move beyond these).\n   - Internal obstacles: \n     - (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4), (3,4), (2,2), (3,6)\n3. **Snake**:\n   - Positions: Head at (4,4), body at (4,3).\n   - Current direction: Up (U).\n4. **Food Items**:\n   - (5,6): value=1, life_span=6\n   - (5,1): value=1, life_span=6\n   - (4,6): value=1, life_span=7\n   - (5,2): value=1, life_span=10\n\n### Snake's Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (4,4) and direction U (up, which is increasing y), the possible moves are:\n\n- **Up (U)**: (4,5)\n- **Down (D)**: (4,3) — but this is the body segment, and moving directly opposite (down from up) is not allowed (no instant reverse).\n- **Left (L)**: (3,4)\n- **Right (R)**: (5,4)\n\nWait, the snake's current direction is U (up), meaning it was moving upwards last turn. The \"no instant reverse\" rule means we cannot move in the opposite direction immediately, which is D (down). So possible moves are U, L, R.\n\nBut let's check the current head direction is U, meaning the snake is facing upwards. The \"no instant reverse\" means if the last move was U, the next move cannot be D. So possible moves are U, L, R.\n\n### Evaluating Possible Moves\n\n1. **Move Up (U) to (4,5)**:\n   - Check for walls: (4,5) is not in the internal obstacles list, and y=5 is within borders (y=7 is max).\n   - Check for body collision: Snake body is at (4,3), so no collision.\n   - Food at (4,5)? No, no food listed there.\n   - Safe move, but no immediate reward.\n\n2. **Move Left (L) to (3,4)**:\n   - Check walls: (3,4) is in internal obstacles list! So cannot move here.\n   - Invalid move.\n\n3. **Move Right (R) to (5,4)**:\n   - Check walls: (5,4) is not in internal obstacles, and x=5 is within borders.\n   - Check body: Body is at (4,3), no collision.\n   - Food at (5,4)? No food listed there.\n   - Safe move, no immediate reward.\n\n### Food Considerations\n\nLooking at the food positions:\n\n1. (5,6): To reach from (4,4), path could be R then U twice.\n2. (5,1): Opposite side, not reachable soon.\n3. (4,6): Directly above, but need to move U twice from (4,4).\n4. (5,2): Below, but current direction is U, and moving D is not allowed.\n\nThe closest food seems to be (4,6) by moving U twice, but we can only decide the immediate move.\n\n### Potential Plans\n\nFrom current position (4,4):\n\n- Move U to (4,5), then next turn can move U to (4,6) to eat food (4,6).\n  - But need to ensure that after eating, the tail doesn't cause a collision.\n  - Current length is 2 (head and one body). After eating, length becomes 3.\n  - Tail is at (4,3), after two moves U, tail moves to (4,4) then (4,5).\n  - New head at (4,6), new tail at (4,4), no collision.\n\nAlternatively, move R to (5,4), then can go U to (5,5), then U to (5,6) to eat (5,6).\n\nBoth sequences seem safe, but (4,6) is closer in terms of steps (2 moves vs 3 moves to (5,6)).\n\n### Checking for Immediate Food Under Head\n\nIs there food under the snake's body? Body is at (4,3), food positions don't include (4,3), so no.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger\n\nIs the head adjacent to the tail with positive food on tail? Tail is at (4,3), head at (4,4). Adjacent vertically. Is there food at (4,3)? No. So no danger here.\n\n### Decision\n\nBetween U and R, moving U seems better as it's a step towards (4,6) food, which is closer than (5,6). Moving R is safe but doesn't immediately progress towards food as directly.\n\n### Verifying U Move\n\nAfter U to (4,5), next move would be U to (4,6) to eat. Then snake grows to length 3: head at (4,6), body at (4,5), tail at (4,4). No collision.\n\n### Final Choice\n\nGiven the above, the best immediate action is to move Up (U).\n\n\\boxed{U}",

Adjacent means same x or y with difference of 1.\n      - (4,6) and (4,4): same x, y difference is 2 (not adjacent).\n      - So no danger from tail reward.\n- **Conclusion**: Safe move with high reward (+6).\n\n#### 2. Move Left (L) to (3,5)\n- **Position after move**: Head at (3,5), tail at (4,5).\n- **Check for collisions**:\n  - Walls: (3,5) is not a wall (internal walls are at (3,1), (3,4), (3,6), but not (3,5)).\n  - Body: New head position (3,5) is not in the new body [(4,5)].\n- **Food**: No food at (3,5).\n- **Conclusion**: Safe move, but no reward.\n\n#### 3. Move Right (R) to (5,5)\n- **Position after move**: Head at (5,5), tail at (4,5).\n- **Check for collisions**:\n  - Walls: (5,5) is not a wall.\n  - Body: New head position (5,5) is not in the new body [(4,5)].\n- **Food**: No food at (5,5).\n- **Conclusion**: Safe move, but no reward.\n\n### Comparing Moves\n\n- **Up (U)**: +6 reward, safe.\n- **Left (L)**: No reward, safe.\n- **Right (R)**: No reward, safe.\n\nClearly, moving Up to (4,6) is the best option as it provides a high reward without any risks in this scenario.\n\n### Verifying Potential Risks\n\nLet me double-check if there's any hidden risk with moving Up:\n- **Tail Reward Danger**: As calculated, the tail is at (4,4), head moving to (4,6). They are not adjacent (difference in y is 2), so no collision after growth.\n- **Food under body**: Currently, the snake's body is at (4,5) and (4,4). No food is under these positions in the given list.\n- **Life span of food at (4,6)**: It's 1, so it disappears after this turn. We must eat it now to get the reward.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe best immediate action is to move Up to eat the high-value food at (4,6).\n\n\\boxed{U}",

I'm going to analyze the current state of the game and decide the best immediate action to take at turn \\( t_0 = 7 \\).\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**1. Grid Dimensions and Walls:**\n- The grid is 8x8 (since x and y range from 0 to 7).\n- **Border walls**: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So, the snake cannot move to these coordinates.\n- **Internal obstacles**: \n  - (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4), (3,4), (2,2), (3,6)\n  \n**2. Snake:**\n- **Positions**: [(5,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4)]\n  - Head at (5,6), then body segments at (4,6), (4,5), and tail at (4,4).\n- **Current direction**: R (right). This means the snake was moving to the right to reach (5,6) from (4,6).\n\n**3. Food Items:**\n- (5,1): value=1, life_span=3\n- (5,2): value=1, life_span=7\n- (6,5): value=1, life_span=10\n\nAll food items are positive (+1 value, +1 length when eaten).\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (5,6) and direction R, the possible moves are U (up), D (down), L (left), R (right). However, we must consider:\n- **No instant reverse**: Since the current direction is R, the opposite direction is L. So, we cannot move L next.\n  \nThus, possible moves: U, D, R.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each possible move:\n\n**1. Move Right (R): (6,6)**\n- New head position: (6,6)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: x=7 is a wall, but (6,6) is not a wall.\n  - Internal obstacles: (6,6) is not in the list.\n  - Body: Snake body is at [(4,6), (4,5), (4,4)]. (6,6) is not in these.\n- Food: No food at (6,6).\n- After moving, the tail moves forward, so the new body will be [(6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5)]. The tail (4,4) is gone.\n- **Safety**: Safe move, no immediate danger.\n- **Opportunity**: Not moving towards any food directly.\n\n**2. Move Up (U): (5,7)**\n- New head position: (5,7)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: y=7 is a border wall. So, (5,7) is a wall.\n  - **Result**: Wall collision, death.\n- **Not viable**.\n\n**3. Move Down (D): (5,5)**\n- New head position: (5,5)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: y=5 is not a wall.\n  - Internal obstacles: (5,5) is not in the list.\n  - Body: Snake body is at [(4,6), (4,5), (4,4)]. (5,5) is not in these.\n- Food: No food at (5,5).\n- After moving, new body: [(5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5)]. Tail (4,4) is gone.\n- **Safety**: Safe move, no immediate danger.\n- **Opportunity**: Moves closer to food at (6,5) in the future.\n\n### Evaluating Food\n\nLet's see where the foods are relative to the head (5,6):\n\n1. (5,1): Below, at y=1. Currently at y=6, so need to go down multiple steps.\n2. (5,2): Below, at y=2.\n3. (6,5): To the right and down from (5,6). Right is x+1, down is y-1.\n\nCurrently, the closest food seems to be (6,5), which is at (x+1, y-1) from (5,6). To reach (6,5), we can:\n- First move right to (6,6), then down to (6,5).\n- Or first move down to (5,5), then right to (6,5).\n\nBetween these, moving down first seems better because:\n- Moving right first to (6,6) doesn't get us closer to any food immediately.\n- Moving down to (5,5) is safe and positions us to move right next to (6,5).\n\n### Checking for Immediate Food Consumption\n\nIs there any food adjacent to the head that we can eat this turn?\n\nAdjacent cells to (5,6):\n- Right: (6,6) - no food.\n- Left: (4,6) - body segment, not food.\n- Up: (5,7) - wall.\n- Down: (5,5) - no food.\n\nNo immediate food to eat this turn.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger\n\nIs there any food under the tail that could be dangerous if we move in a certain way?\n\nTail is at (4,4). Food items are at (5,1), (5,2), (6,5). None are at (4,4), so no danger from tail reward.\n\n### Life Span of Foods\n\n- (5,1): life_span=3. Current turn=7, so disappears at turn=10.\n- (5,2): life_span=7. Disappears at turn=14.\n- (6,5): life_span=10. Disappears at turn=17.\n\nAll foods have enough life left, so no urgency based on that.\n\n### Decision\n\nBetween the safe moves R and D:\n- R to (6,6): Safe, but not directly helpful.\n- D to (5,5): Safe, and sets up to move right next to (6,5).\n\nMoving D seems more strategic as it positions the snake to potentially eat (6,5) next turn.\n\n### Verifying Next Move After D\n\nIf we move D to (5,5), next turn:\n- Head at (5,5), body [(5,6), (4,6), (4,5)].\n- Possible moves from (5,5), direction D (since we moved down):\n  - Cannot move U (opposite of D).\n  - Possible: D, L, R.\n    - D to (5,4): Check walls/body. (5,4) is not a wall or body.\n    - L to (4,5): Body at (4,5) is the tail, but tail will move to (4,6), so safe.\n    - R to (6,5): Food at (6,5). Eating it is safe because:\n      - New head at (6,5), body grows to [(6,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6)].\n      - Tail is at (4,6), no collision with head.\n      - No food under tail to cause danger.\n\nSo, moving D now allows us to potentially eat (6,5) next turn safely.\n\n### Alternative Consideration: Moving R Now\n\nIf we move R to (6,6), next turn:\n- Head at (6,6), body [(5,6), (4,6), (4,5)].\n- Possible moves from (6,6), direction R:\n  - Cannot move L.\n  - Possible: U, D, R.\n    - U to (6,7): wall.\n    - D to (6,5): food at (6,5). Eating it:\n      - New head at (6,5), body [(6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6)].\n      - Tail is at (4,6), no collision.\n      - Safe.\n    - R to (7,6): wall.\n\nSo, moving R now also allows eating (6,5) next turn. But moving D now seems more direct in pathing towards (6,5).\n\n### Final Decision\n\nBoth R and D are safe now and can lead to eating (6,5) next turn. However, moving D now seems slightly better because:\n- It moves the snake downward, which might be useful for other foods at (5,1) and (5,2) in the future.\n- It's a more direct path towards (6,5) (diagonal down-right).\n\nMoving R now is also safe but doesn't provide as much flexibility for future moves towards other foods.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Dangers\n\nIs there any immediate danger in moving D?\n- Next to tail: Tail is at (4,4), head is at (5,6). Not adjacent.\n- No food under tail to cause danger.\n- No walls or body in (5,5).\n\nAll clear.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe best immediate action is to move **Down (D)**.\n\n\\boxed{D}",

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State\n\nFirst, let's visualize the current state of the game based on the provided information.\n\n**Grid Dimensions**: The grid is 8x8 (from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7). The borders (x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7) are walls, meaning the snake cannot move into these cells.\n\n**Internal Obstacles**: These are additional walls inside the grid where the snake cannot move:\n- (3,1), (2,4), (1,1), (1,6), (6,4), (3,4), (2,2), (3,6)\n\n**Snake Positions**: The snake is composed of the following segments in order (head first):\n1. Head: (5,5)\n2. Body: (5,6)\n3. Body: (4,6)\n4. Tail: (4,5)\n\n**Snake Head Direction**: Currently moving \"D\" (Down), which means the head is facing downward (negative y-direction).\n\n**Food Items**: There are three food items on the grid:\n1. (5,1): value = 1, life_span = 2\n2. (5,2): value = 1, life_span = 6\n3. (6,5): value = 1, life_span = 9\n\n### Determining Possible Moves\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However, there are constraints:\n1. **No Instant Reverse**: Since the current direction is Down (D), the snake cannot move Up (U) next, as that would be the opposite direction.\n   \n   So, possible moves excluding reverse: D, L, R.\n\n2. **Wall and Obstacle Collision**: The snake cannot move into a cell that is a wall or an obstacle.\n\nLet's check each possible move:\n\n- **Down (D)**: Current head is at (5,5). Moving down would be (5,4).\n  - Check (5,4):\n    - Is it a wall? Border walls are at y=0 and y=7, so y=4 is not a border.\n    - Is it an internal obstacle? The internal obstacles are listed, and (5,4) is not among them.\n    - Is it part of the snake's body? The snake's body segments are at (5,6), (4,6), (4,5). (5,4) is not part of the body.\n  - So, moving Down is possible.\n\n- **Left (L)**: Moving left from (5,5) would be (4,5).\n  - Check (4,5):\n    - Not a border wall.\n    - Not an internal obstacle.\n    - Part of the snake: The tail is at (4,5). Normally, moving into the tail is allowed because the tail will move forward when the snake moves, but we need to check for \"Tail Reward Danger\".\n    - Tail Reward Danger: If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake. Here, the tail is at (4,5), and the food items are at (5,1), (5,2), (6,5). So, no food is at the tail. Therefore, moving into the tail is safe.\n  - So, moving Left is possible.\n\n- **Right (R)**: Moving right from (5,5) would be (6,5).\n  - Check (6,5):\n    - Not a border wall (x=7 is border, x=6 is not).\n    - Not an internal obstacle (internal obstacles include (6,4), but not (6,5)).\n    - Not part of the snake's body.\n    - There is food at (6,5) with value=1 and life_span=9.\n      - Eating food increases length by 1 and score by 1.\n      - No Tail Reward Danger here since the tail is at (4,5), not adjacent to the head at (5,5) (adjacent means sharing an edge, which (4,5) and (5,5) do, but the food is not on the tail).\n      - However, the head is moving to (6,5), which is food, so it will eat it.\n  - So, moving Right is possible and leads to eating positive food.\n\n### Evaluating Food Options\n\nNow, let's look at the food positions and see if moving towards them is beneficial:\n\n1. (5,1): value=1, life_span=2\n   - Current turn is 8, so it will disappear at turn 10.\n   - Distance from head (5,5) to (5,1): 4 units in y-direction.\n   - To reach it, need to move Down multiple times, but life_span is only 2, so it will disappear before we can reach it.\n   - Not reachable in time.\n\n2. (5,2): value=1, life_span=6\n   - Disappears at turn 14.\n   - Distance: 3 units down.\n   - Can reach in 3 moves (life_span allows it), but moving down now would be towards it.\n   - But moving down now to (5,4), then next moves would be towards (5,3), then (5,2).\n   - However, moving down now is possible, but we have to consider other options.\n\n3. (6,5): value=1, life_span=9\n   - Disappears at turn 17.\n   - Adjacent to head (right move).\n   - Can eat it immediately by moving Right.\n\n### Deciding the Best Move\n\nGiven the options:\n- Move Down (D): (5,4) - no immediate food, but path towards (5,2) which is reachable.\n- Move Left (L): (4,5) - no food, safe move.\n- Move Right (R): (6,5) - eat positive food immediately.\n\nEating food increases the score and length, which is generally good unless it leads to a trap. Here, eating (6,5) is safe:\n- After eating, the snake grows by 1, so new tail will be where the current tail is (4,5), and the new segment is added where the head was (5,5).\n- New snake positions: [(6,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5)].\n- No immediate collision risks from this growth.\n\nOther moves:\n- Moving Left is safe but doesn't gain anything immediately.\n- Moving Down is safe and starts heading towards another food, but the immediate reward is better with Right.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Dangers\n\nAre there any immediate dangers with moving Right?\n- After moving Right to (6,5), the next moves would need to avoid colliding with the new body segment at (5,5).\n- Possible next moves from (6,5):\n  - Current direction would be R (since we moved R).\n  - Cannot move L (reverse).\n  - Possible: U (6,6), D (6,4), R (7,5).\n    - (6,6): Check if it's safe.\n      - Not a border (y=7 is border, y=6 is not).\n      - Not an internal obstacle (internal obstacles include (1,6), (3,6), but not (6,6)).\n      - Not part of the new body (new body is (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5)).\n      - So, U is safe next.\n    - (6,4):\n      - Not border.\n      - Internal obstacle: (6,4) is an obstacle! So cannot move D next.\n    - (7,5):\n      - x=7 is border wall. Cannot move R.\n  - So, after R, only U is safe next move, which is acceptable.\n\nMoving Down:\n- To (5,4). Next moves could be towards (5,3), then (5,2) to eat food there.\n- But immediate reward is less than moving Right.\n\nMoving Left:\n- To (4,5). Then next moves could be L to (3,5), etc., but no immediate benefit.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe best immediate action is to move Right (R) to eat the positive food at (6,5), which is safe and maximizes the immediate score gain without leading to a trap in the next move.\n\n\\boxed{R}",

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Problem\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario presented:\n\n1. **Game Board**: It's an 8x8 grid (since x and y range from 0 to 7).\n2. **Walls**: \n   - **Border walls**: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.\n   - **Internal obstacles**: A list of coordinates like (3,1), (2,4), etc.\n3. **Snake**: \n   - **Positions**: Head at (6,5), followed by body segments at (5,5), (5,6), (4,6), (4,5).\n   - **Direction**: Currently moving Right (R).\n4. **Food**:\n   - Two pieces of food:\n     - (5,1): value=1, life_span=1.\n     - (5,2): value=1, life_span=5.\n\n### Visualizing the Snake and Food\n\nFirst, I'll sketch the snake's position to understand its shape and possible movements.\n\n- **Head**: (6,5)\n- **Body**: (5,5) → (5,6) → (4,6) → (4,5)\n\nLooking at the coordinates:\n- From head (6,5), the next segment is (5,5) — left of the head.\n- Then (5,6) — up from (5,5).\n- Then (4,6) — left from (5,6).\n- Finally, (4,5) — down from (4,6).\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nThe snake is currently moving Right (R). According to the rules:\n- **No instant reverse**: Cannot move Left (L) next since it's the opposite of Right.\n\nSo, possible moves are:\n1. **Up (U)**: (x, y+1) → (6,6)\n2. **Down (D)**: (x, y-1) → (6,4)\n3. **Right (R)**: (x+1, y) → (7,5)\n\nBut we need to check for collisions:\n1. **Up (U) to (6,6)**:\n   - Check walls: y=7 is a wall, but (6,6) is not a wall.\n   - Check body segments: (5,6) is part of the body, but (6,6) is not in the snake's current positions.\n   - **Valid move**.\n2. **Down (D) to (6,4)**:\n   - Check walls: y=0 is a wall, but (6,4) is not a wall.\n   - Check body segments: (6,4) is not in the snake's current positions.\n   - **Valid move**.\n3. **Right (R) to (7,5)**:\n   - Check walls: x=7 is a wall → (7,5) is a border wall.\n   - **Invalid move** → leads to collision.\n\n### Food Considerations\n\nNow, let's look at the food:\n1. **(5,1)**: value=1, life_span=1.\n   - Distance from head (6,5): Manhattan distance is |6-5| + |5-1| = 1 + 4 = 5.\n   - Life_span=1 → it will disappear next turn. Not reachable in one move.\n   - **Not relevant for immediate decision**.\n2. **(5,2)**: value=1, life_span=5.\n   - Distance: |6-5| + |5-2| = 1 + 3 = 4.\n   - Life_span=5 → still has time.\n   - To reach (5,2), the snake needs to move towards it.\n\n### Evaluating Moves Towards Food\n\nThe goal is to maximize score by eating positive food. The only relevant food is (5,2).\n\n**Path to (5,2)**:\n- Current position: (6,5).\n- Need to reduce x and y coordinates.\n\nPossible moves:\n1. **Up (U)**: (6,6) → moves away from food in y-direction.\n   - Not helpful.\n2. **Down (D)**: (6,4) → reduces y-coordinate but increases distance in x.\n   - Still, x needs to be reduced.\n   - After moving down, next move could be left to (5,4).\n   - But (5,2) is still two steps down from there.\n   - Not the most efficient path.\n3. **Left (L)**: Not allowed because it's the reverse of current direction (R).\n\nHmm, none of the immediate moves directly reduce the distance to (5,2). \n\n### Considering Tail and Food Interaction\n\nThe rules mention **Tail Reward Danger**: If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake.\n\n- **Tail position**: (4,5).\n- **Head position**: (6,5).\n- **Adjacent check**: For (6,5), adjacent cells are (6,6), (6,4), (5,5), (7,5).\n  - Tail is at (4,5), not adjacent to head.\n  - No immediate danger here.\n\n### Checking for Other Food or Obstacles\n\nAre there any other food items or obstacles to consider?\n- Only two food items, one is expiring next turn and unreachable.\n- The other is (5,2), which is reachable but not in the immediate next move.\n\n### Best Immediate Action\n\nGiven the constraints:\n- **Right (R)**: Leads to wall collision → invalid.\n- **Left (L)**: Reverse direction → invalid.\n- **Up (U)**: (6,6) → safe but moves away from food.\n- **Down (D)**: (6,4) → safe and might be part of a longer path towards food.\n\n**Down (D)** seems the best option because:\n1. It's safe.\n2. It doesn't move directly away from the food.\n3. It might allow future moves towards the food.\n\n### Verifying Down (D) Move\n\nAfter moving Down to (6,4):\n- New head position: (6,4).\n- New body: [(6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6)].\n- Tail is now (4,6).\n\nNext possible moves:\n- **Left (L)**: (5,4) → towards food (5,2).\n- **Down (D)**: (6,3) → further down.\n- **Right (R)**: (7,4) → wall collision.\n\nThis sets up a potential path towards the food.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSince none of the immediate moves can reach the food in one step, the best option is to choose a move that keeps the snake safe and positions it for future food collection. **Down (D)** is the optimal choice here.\n\n\\boxed{D}",
