Moving **D (Down)** to (5,5) allows the snake to eat this positive food (+1 score, +1 length) before it expires. \n- **Safety Check**: \n  - The move to (5,5) is valid (no wall/obstacle/body collision). \n  - The tail is at (6,4), not adjacent to the head (no \"Tail Reward Danger\"). \n- **Future Plan**: After eating (5,5), the snake can navigate toward (2,6) (life span 8) in subsequent turns, avoiding the dangerous (1,5) area. \n\n### Key Points:\n1. **Prioritize Expiring Food**: (5,5) must be eaten now or lost forever.\n2. **Avoid Dead Ends**: (1,5) is surrounded by obstacles and leads to certain death; ignored in favor of safer paths.\n3. **Growth Strategy**: Eating (5,5) increases length, but the grid has space to maneuver toward (2,6) later. \n\nNo further sequence is needed as the task only requires the immediate action for Turn 9.

Safe (tail will move away).\n2. **D (Down)**: (4,4) \n   - Free (no walls, obstacles, or body segments).\n3. **R (Right)**: (5,5) \n   - Free (no walls, obstacles, or body segments).\n4. **L (Left)**: (3,5) \n   - Occupied by body segment (invalid: collision + reverse move not allowed).\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **(6,1)**: Impossible to reach before it disappears (min 6 moves needed, disappears after turn 20). Ignore.\n2. **(3,2)**: Requires at least 4 moves (e.g., D→D→L→D). Can be eaten by turn 20.\n3. **(4,2)**: Directly below (3 moves: D→D→D). Can be eaten by turn 19.\n\n### Best Immediate Action:\n- **Move D (Down) to (4,4)**. This starts a safe path toward (4,2), which has a long life span and is the closest food. After eating (4,2), the snake can avoid the risky left side by moving right (to (5,2)) instead of left (to (3,2)).\n\n### Why Not Other Moves?\n- **U (Up)**: Leads to limited space near walls and may trap the snake.\n- **R (Right)**: Diverts from the closest food (4,2), risking missing it later.\n- **L (Left)**: Invalid (collision + reverse move).\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe optimal immediate action is to move **Down (D)** to (4,4), initiating a safe path to eat (4,2) while preserving flexibility for future moves.\n\n\\boxed{D}",

Moving **L** would collide with the body at (4,2), and **D** is an illegal reverse.\n2. **Strategic Choice**: Moving **U** is optimal because:\n   - It avoids dead ends and keeps both foods accessible.\n   - It allows a clear path to (2,5) via subsequent moves:  \n     - Turn 25: U → (5,3)  \n     - Turn 26: U → (5,4)  \n     - Turn 27: U → (5,5)  \n     - Turn 28: L → (4,5)  \n     - Turn 29: L → (3,5)  \n     - Turn 30: L → (2,5) (eat).  \n   - The food at (4,6) can be targeted afterward (e.g., via (2,6) → (3,6) → (4,6)).\n3. **Risk Mitigation**: Moving **R** at Turn 25 risks missing (2,5) due to its short lifespan (disappears after Turn 31), whereas **U** secures both foods safely.\n\nThus, the immediate action is:\n\n\\boxed{U}",

Unsafe (collision).\n- **Right (R)**: to (6, 3)\n  - Check: (6, 3) is not occupied by snake, not a wall, not an obstacle. Safe.\n\nThus, the safe moves are **U** and **R**.\n\n### Evaluating Moves:\n1. **Move Up (U) to (5, 4)**:\n   - Gets closer to food at (4, 6).\n   - Allows a path to (2, 5) via (4, 4) and (3, 5).\n   - Avoids moving away from both foods.\n\n2. **Move Right (R) to (6, 3)**:\n   - Moves away from both foods.\n   - Makes it harder to reach (2, 5) in time (only 5 turns left to reach it by turn 31).\n   - Not optimal for maximizing score.\n\n### Path to Maximize Score:\nTo eat both foods:\n- **First food (4, 6)**:\n  - Path: (5, 3) → (5, 4) → (4, 4) → (4, 5) → (4, 6) (eat on turn 29).\n- **Second food (2, 5)**:\n  - From (4, 6), move left to (3, 6), then left to (2, 6), then down to (2, 5) (eat on turn 31).\n\nThis path ensures both foods are eaten before they expire.\n\n### Immediate Action:\nThe best immediate move is **Up (U)** to (5, 4), as it starts the optimal path to eat both foods.\n\n\\boxed{U}",

No collision risk.\n- **Down (D)**: Move to (4,4). \n  - (4,4) is free (no food or obstacles).\n- **Up (U)**: Move to (4,6). \n  - (4,6) is occupied by the snake's body (collision risk). Invalid.\n- **Right (R)**: Opposite direction (invalid).\n\n### Evaluating Moves:\n1. **Move Left (L) to (3,5)**:\n   - Eat food: +1 score, length increases to 12.\n   - Next moves from (3,5):\n     - Up (U) to (3,6): Safe (tail cell).\n     - Left (L) to (2,5): Free.\n     - Down (D) to (3,4): Obstacle (invalid).\n   - Risk: May get trapped in the top-left corner with limited escape routes.\n\n2. **Move Down (D) to (4,4)**:\n   - No food eaten. Length remains 11.\n   - Next moves from (4,4):\n     - Down (D) to (4,3): Free.\n     - Left (L) to (3,4): Obstacle (invalid).\n     - Right (R) to (5,4): Occupied by snake (invalid).\n   - Path to (3,1): Can reach (3,1) in ~4 turns (e.g., D to (4,3), L to (3,3), D to (3,2), D to (3,1)).\n   - Advantage: More space in the bottom area for survival.\n\n### Decision:\n- **Immediate Reward**: Moving Left (L) to (3,5) gives +1 score now.\n- **Long-term Survival**: Moving Down (D) to (4,4) allows reaching (3,1) later and avoids potential traps in the top-left.\n- **Food Expiry**: \n  - (2,1) cannot be reached this turn (distance > 1).\n  - (3,5) expires after Turn 46. If we go down, we cannot eat it later (too far by Turn 45).\n  - (3,1) can be eaten by Turn 45 if we go down.\n\n### Optimal Choice:\nGiven the trade-off between immediate reward (+1 now) and long-term survival (more space and potential to eat (3,1)), the safer and more strategic move is to **go Down (D)** to (4,4). This avoids the risk of getting trapped and allows a clear path to (3,1).\n\n\\boxed{D}",

To eat it:\n     - The tail must move away (vacate (5, 3)).\n     - The head must move to (5, 3) when it's free.\n\n### Plan to Maximize Score:\n- **Priority**: Eat both foods if possible. \n- **(5, 3)** is closer and has a longer life span, so prioritize eating it first.\n- **(6, 5)** is farther but can be eaten later (within 7 turns).\n\n### Sequence to Eat (5, 3):\n1. **Turn 50**: Move **U** to (5, 2). \n   - This vacates (5, 3) (tail moves to (5, 4)).\n   - (5, 3) is now free with food.\n2. **Turn 51**: Move **U** to (5, 3) to eat the food.\n   - Snake grows to length 14.\n   - No collision risk because (5, 3) is no longer the tail cell when eaten.\n\n### Sequence to Eat (6, 5):\nAfter eating (5, 3), the snake can navigate toward (6, 5):\n1. **Turn 52**: Move **R** to (6, 3).\n2. **Turn 53**: Move **U** to (6, 4).\n3. **Turn 54**: Move **U** to (6, 5) to eat the food.\n\n### Why Not Move R at Turn 50?\n- Moving **R** to (6, 1) at turn 50 delays eating (5, 3) until turn 52 (after moving to (6, 2) and (5, 2)).\n- This is less efficient and risks (6, 5) expiring if the snake gets stuck.\n\n### Immediate Action at Turn 50:\nThe best immediate action is **U** to start the sequence for eating both foods safely.\n\n\\boxed{U}",

This is the only accessible food this turn, and it provides a significant reward (+8). Moving Up is safe and does not result in any collisions. \n\n### Reasoning:\n1. **Food Accessibility**: The food at (5, 3) is directly above the snake's head (5, 2) and can be eaten by moving Up. The other food at (6, 5) is unreachable in one move and will disappear after this turn.\n2. **Safety**: Moving Up to (5, 3) does not collide with any walls, obstacles, or the snake's body. The tail is at (5, 4), which is not adjacent to the head after this move, so there is no risk of Tail Reward Danger.\n3. **Reward**: The food at (5, 3) has a high value (+8), making it highly beneficial to eat it before it disappears.\n\n### Action:\n\\boxed{U}",

The snake can still navigate toward (6,2) after eating (6,5) by moving left and down in subsequent turns. The immediate +1 score outweighs the minor risk of reduced mobility.\n\n### Action:\n\\boxed{U}",

The food at (6,2) is more urgent (shorter lifespan) but currently blocked by snake body at (6,4) and (6,3)\n2. The food at (4,4) is currently under the snake's body (position 13 in the list)\n3.

The current direction is U, so the opposite is D, which is already invalid due to collision.\n\nThus, the valid immediate moves are **U to (4,6)** and **L to (3,5)**.\n\n### Evaluating Food Accessibility\n\n1. **Food at (6,2)**:\n   - Life span: 3 (disappears after Turn 61).\n   - Current turn: 59.\n   - To eat it, must reach (6,2) by Turn 61.\n   - Distance from (4,5) to (6,2): |4-6| + |5-2| = 2 + 3 = 5.\n   - Moves left: Turn 59, 60, 61 (3 moves).\n   - Minimum moves needed: 5 > 3 → **impossible to reach (6,2) in time**.\n\n2. **Food at (4,5)**:\n   - Currently under the snake's head.\n   - To eat it, the head must move away and then back onto (4,5).\n   - However, the rules state that food under the body can only be eaten if:\n     1. The body moves away (tail moves).\n     2. The head moves onto the food cell.\n   - Currently, the head is at (4,5), which is the food position, but the food is under the head, not the body.\n   - **Cannot eat (4,5) immediately by moving away and back because it's under the head, not the body.**\n\nWait, the rules say:\n> Food can spawn under the snake's body but can *only be eaten* if:\n> 1. The body moves away, *and*  \n> 2. The head moves onto the food cell.  \n\nHere, the food is at (4,5), and the head is at (4,5). The food is under the head, not under the body. So the head is already on the food, but the rules imply that food under the body can only be eaten if the body moves away and the head moves onto it. \n\nBut in this case, the food is under the head, not the body. The rules don't specify whether food under the head can be eaten immediately. \n\nGiven the ambiguity, it's safer to assume that food under the head cannot be eaten unless the head moves away and then back, which isn't possible in one move. \n\nThus, **cannot eat (4,5) at Turn 59**.\n\n### Re-evaluating Possible Moves\n\nGiven that neither food can be eaten immediately at Turn 59, the goal is to position the snake to eat (4,5) in the future (since (6,2) is unreachable).\n\nCurrent valid moves:\n- U to (4,6)\n- L to (3,5)\n\n**Option 1: U to (4,6)**\n- New head position: (4,6)\n- Direction becomes U.\n- Next moves:\n  - From (4,6), cannot go D (reverse), U to (4,7) is wall, so can go L to (3,6) or R to (5,6).\n  - Going R to (5,6) may lead to dead ends (right side is crowded with body segments).\n  - Going L to (3,6) is safer.\n\n**Option 2: L to (3,5)**\n- New head position: (3,5)\n- Direction becomes L.\n- Next moves:\n  - From (3,5), cannot go R (reverse), D to (3,4) is obstacle, so can go U to (3,6) or L to (2,5).\n  - Going U to (3,6) is better to avoid obstacles on the left.\n\nBoth options seem viable, but moving left (L to (3,5)) may provide more flexibility to eventually eat (4,5) by circling back.\n\n### Planning to Eat (4,5)\n\nTo eat (4,5), the head must move away from (4,5) and then return when the body is no longer there. \n\nCurrent head at (4,5), body at (4,4), etc.\n\nIf we move L to (3,5), then next move could be U to (3,6), then R to (4,6), then D to (4,5) to eat the food.\n\nSequence:\n1. Turn 59: L to (3,5)\n2. Turn 60: U to (3,6)\n3. Turn 61: R to (4,6)\n4. Turn 62: D to (4,5) → eat food.\n\nThis seems feasible.\n\n### Checking for Dead Ends\n\nAfter eating at (4,5) on Turn 62, the snake grows, and the tail doesn't move. Then:\n\n5. Turn 63: From (4,5), can go U to (4,6), L to (3,5), or R to (5,5) (body), but not D (reverse).\n   - U to (4,6) or L to (3,5).\n   - Choose L to (3,5) to avoid right side.\n\n6. Turn 64: From (3,5), can go U to (3,6), L to (2,5), but not D (obstacle) or R (reverse).\n   - U to (3,6).\n\n7. Turn 65: From (3,6), can go L to (2,6) or R to (4,6), but not U (wall) or D (reverse).\n   - R to (4,6).\n\nThis seems to create a loop, avoiding dead ends.\n\n### Immediate Action at Turn 59\n\nGiven the above, the best immediate action is to move Left (L) to (3,5) to set up the sequence to eat (4,5) in future turns.\n\n### Final Decision\n\n\\boxed{L}",

However, moving right (R) allows the snake to survive slightly longer (until turn 64) compared to moving left (L) (death on turn 64 as well). Since both options are equally fatal, the choice is arbitrary. \n\n### Final Decision\n\nGiven the constraints and the analysis, the immediate action is to move right (R) to prolong survival by one additional turn.\n\n\\boxed{R}",

It is also not adjacent to the head, so no immediate interaction.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The snake is completely trapped with no valid moves that avoid collision or wall hits. \n   - Any move will result in the snake's death:\n     - **D**: Collision with body at (6, 5).\n     - **U** or **R**: Wall collision.\n     - **L**: Collision with body at (5, 6) and invalid reverse move.\n\n### Decision\nSince all possible moves lead to immediate death, the snake has no viable action to continue the game. However, the rules require choosing an action for the current turn. \n\n- **Choosing D (Down)**: This is the only non-wall move, even though it results in a collision. This is the least \"invalid\" move in terms of the game's constraints (not reversing direction and not hitting a wall).\n\n### Final Answer\n\\boxed{D}",
