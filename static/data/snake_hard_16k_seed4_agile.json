Now, let's consider the next moves to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n\n#### Available Food After Turn 14\n\n- (6,3): life_span = 3 → available until Turn 16 (disappears after).\n- (4,6): life_span = 6 → available until Turn 19.\n\n#### Turn 15: From (2,5), direction R\n\nPossible moves (cannot reverse to L):\n\n- **Up (U) to (2,6)**:\n  - (2,6) is not a wall and not occupied by the snake.\n  - However, from (2,6), the next moves would be limited:\n    - U to (2,7): wall.\n    - D to (2,5): body segment.\n    - L to (1,6): wall.\n    - R to (3,6): wall.\n  - **Dead end**: No valid moves after, so this is risky.\n\n- **Down (D) to (2,4)**:\n  - (2,4) is the current tail.\n  - After moving, tail moves away, so no collision.\n  - New positions: [(2,4), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4)].\n  - Direction: Down (D).\n\n- **Right (R) to (3,5)**:\n  - (3,5) is not a wall and not occupied.\n  - New positions: [(3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4)].\n  - Direction: Right (R).\n\n**Evaluating Options**:\n\n1. **Move U to (2,6)**: Leads to immediate dead end — avoid.\n2. **Move D to (2,4)**:\n   - From (2,4), possible moves:\n     - D to (2,3): wall.\n     - L to (1,4): tail, safe.\n     - R to (3,4): free.\n   - Allows movement towards safer areas.\n3. **Move R to (3,5)**:\n   - From (3,5), possible moves:\n     - U to (3,6): wall.\n     - D to (3,4): free.\n     - R to (4,5): free.\n   - Can potentially reach (4,6) but risks dead end after eating.\n\n#### Avoiding Dead Ends\n\nEating (4,6) is risky because:\n\n- To eat (4,6), must be at (4,5) and move U to (4,6).\n- After eating, positions: [(4,6), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5)].\n- Next moves from (4,6):\n  - U to (4,7): wall.\n  - D to (4,5): body.\n  - L to (3,6): wall.\n  - R to (5,6): wall.\n- **Dead end**: No valid moves after eating — fatal.\n\nTherefore, **avoid eating (4,6)**.\n\n#### Optimal Path for Survival\n\nGiven that (6,3) is unreachable by Turn 16 and (4,6) is a trap, the best strategy is to avoid eating (4,6) and focus on survival by moving to open areas.\n\n**Proposed Moves**:\n\n1. **Turn 14**: R (forced).\n2. **Turn 15**: D to (2,4) (avoid upper dead end).\n3. **Turn 16**: R to (3,4) (move towards open space).\n4. **Turn 17**: D to (3,3) (continue downwards).\n5. **Turn 18**: R to (4,3) (further into open area).\n\nThis sequence avoids dangerous food and keeps the snake in safer, open parts of the grid.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the above analysis, the immediate action at Turn 14 is to move Right (R). The subsequent moves are planned to ensure survival by avoiding dead ends and dangerous food.\n\n\\boxed{R}",

Possible moves: D, L, R\n- **Food**:\n  - (4,6): value +1, life span 4 (disappears after Turn 20)\n  - (2,2): value +1, life span 9 (disappears after Turn 25)\n\n### Immediate Moves:\nFrom (3,4), the possible moves are:\n1. **D (Down) to (3,3)**:\n   - (3,3) is free (no obstacle or body).\n   - Moves away from both foods but opens paths to (2,2) later.\n2. **L (Left) to (2,4)**:\n   - (2,4) is free.\n   - Moves toward (2,2) but requires navigating around obstacles.\n3. **R (Right) to (4,4)**:\n   - (4,4) is free.\n   - Moves toward (4,6), but eating (4,6) leads to immediate death (trapped).\n\n### Analysis of Eating (4,6):\n- To eat (4,6), the path is: R to (4,4), U to (4,5), U to (4,6).\n- After eating (4,6), the snake is at (4,6) with body at [(4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5)].\n- From (4,6), all adjacent cells are blocked:\n  - U: (4,7) is a wall.\n  - D: (4,5) is body.\n  - L: (3,6) is an obstacle.\n  - R: (5,6) is an obstacle.\n- **Result**: Death on the next turn. Not viable.\n\n### Analysis of Eating (2,2):\n- To eat (2,2), the path is: D to (3,3), D to (3,2), L to (2,2).\n- After eating (2,2), the snake is at (2,2) with body at [(3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5)].\n- From (2,2), the only possible move is L to (1,2) (other directions are blocked).\n- From (1,2), the only possible move is D to (1,1).\n- From (1,1), all moves are blocked:\n  - U: (1,2) is body.\n  - D: (1,0) is a wall.\n  - L: (0,1) is a wall.\n  - R: (2,1) is an obstacle.\n- **Result**: Death after a few turns. Not ideal but scores +1.\n\n### Alternative: Avoid Eating (4,6) and Delay Eating (2,2):\n- Move D to (3,3), then D to (3,2), then R to (4,2), etc.\n- This avoids immediate death but may not score soon.\n- The food (2,2) has a long life span (9 turns), so we can delay eating it.\n\n### Best Immediate Action:\nGiven the risks of eating either food leading to death, the safest immediate move is to **go down to (3,3)**. This avoids the trap of (4,6) and keeps the option to eat (2,2) later when the snake is in a better position.\n\n### Final Decision:\n\\boxed{D}",

Cannot eat it. Ignore.\n\n2. **Food at (2, 2)**:\n   - Distance: 2 cells away (can reach in 2 turns).\n   - Life span: 6 (can wait).\n   - Path: Move L to (3, 2), then L to (2, 2).\n   - Risk: (2, 2) is a dead end (only exits are (1, 2) and (3, 2), both risky). Eating it now leads to trapping the snake. Avoid.\n\n3. **Food at (4, 3)**:\n   - Currently under the snake's body at (4, 3).\n   - To eat: Must move the body away first, then move head to (4, 3).\n   - Life span: 9 (can wait).\n   - Plan: Free (4, 3) by moving the snake such that the tail moves away from (4, 3), then head can move to it.\n\n### Immediate Action:\nTo free (4, 3), we need to move the snake so that the segment at (4, 3) moves away. The best immediate move is to go **left (L) to (3, 2)**. This starts the process of freeing (4, 3) by shifting the body segments.\n\n### Why L to (3, 2)?\n- Moves the head to (3, 2), shifting the body:\n  - New head: (3, 2)\n  - Body: [(4, 2), (4, 3), (3, 3)]\n  - Tail: (3, 4) moves to (3, 3).\n- Next steps can involve moving up to (3, 3) (tail) to further shift the body and free (4, 3).\n\n### Avoiding Risks:\n- No collision with walls or obstacles.\n- No instant reverse (already moving D, cannot move U).\n- Not moving towards dead ends (like (2, 2)).\n\n### Final Decision:\nThe safest and most strategic immediate move is **left (L)** to (3, 2).\n\n\\boxed{L}",

The plan must adapt to the current state:\n1. **Move L to (2,4)**: Safe, aligns with avoiding food traps.  \n2. **Move D to (3,3)**: Also safe, explores lower grid.  \n\nGiven the priority to avoid (2,6) and (6,5), **L to (2,4)** is chosen to continue the leftward exploration away from risky areas.  \n\n\\boxed{L}  \n\n**Reasoning**: Moves the snake left to (2,4), avoiding collisions and maintaining maneuverability in open spaces.

(3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6), (5,3), (5,4), (1,6)\n- **Snake Positions**: \n  - Head at (6,4), followed by body segments: (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (5,2) (tail).\n- **Snake Head Direction**: Down (D), meaning the snake just moved from (6,5) to (6,4).\n- **Food**:\n  - (1,4): value +1, life span 6\n  - (5,2): value +1, life span 8 (currently under the tail)\n\n### Possible Moves at Turn 54\nFrom the head position (6,4) with current direction Down (D), the possible moves are:\n\n1. **Down (D)**: to (6,3)\n   - Check if (6,3) is valid:\n     - Not a border wall.\n     - Not an internal obstacle (not in the list).\n     - Not occupied by the snake's body (only (6,4), (6,5), etc., are occupied).\n     - **Valid**.\n\n2. **Left (L)**: to (5,4)\n   - Check if (5,4) is valid:\n     - Not a border wall.\n     - It is an internal obstacle (listed as (5,4)).\n     - **Invalid**.\n\n3. **Right (R)**: to (7,4)\n   - Check if (7,4) is valid:\n     - x=7 is a border wall.\n     - **Invalid**.\n\n4. **Up (U)**: to (6,5)\n   - Check if (6,5) is valid:\n     - It's the reverse direction (from Down to Up), which is not allowed.\n     - Also, (6,5) is occupied by the snake's body.\n     - **Invalid**.\n\n**Conclusion**: The only possible move at Turn 54 is **Down (D)** to (6,3).\n\n### Simulating the Move\nIf we move Down to (6,3):\n\n- **New Head Position**: (6,3)\n- **New Body Positions**: \n  - The previous head (6,4) becomes the first body segment.\n  - The tail (5,2) is removed (since no food is eaten).\n- **New Snake Positions**:\n  - [(6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2)]\n- **Direction**: Still Down (D) since we continued in the same direction.\n\n### Next Moves (Turn 55)\nAt Turn 55, the head is at (6,3), direction Down.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n1. **Down (D)**: to (6,2)\n   - Check (6,2):\n     - Not a wall or obstacle.\n     - Not occupied by the snake.\n     - **Valid**.\n\n2. **Left (L)**: to (5,3)\n   - Check (5,3):\n     - It's an internal obstacle.\n     - **Invalid**.\n\n3. **Right (R)**: to (7,3)\n   - x=7 is a wall.\n   - **Invalid**.\n\n4. **Up (U)**: to (6,4)\n   - Reverse direction and (6,4) is a body segment.\n   - **Invalid**.\n\n**Conclusion**: Only possible move at Turn 55 is **Down (D)** to (6,2).\n\n### Simulating the Move\nMove Down to (6,2):\n\n- **New Head Position**: (6,2)\n- **New Body Positions**:\n  - Previous head (6,3) becomes first body segment.\n  - Tail (4,2) is removed.\n- **New Snake Positions**:\n  - [(6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3)]\n- **Direction**: Still Down (D).\n\n### Next Moves (Turn 56)\nAt Turn 56, head at (6,2), direction Down.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n1. **Down (D)**: to (6,1)\n   - Check (6,1):\n     - Not a wall or obstacle.\n     - Not occupied by the snake.\n     - **Valid**.\n\n2. **Left (L)**: to (5,2)\n   - Check (5,2):\n     - Not a wall or obstacle.\n     - Previously, the tail was at (5,2), but now it's moved away.\n     - There is positive food at (5,2).\n     - **Valid** and can eat the food.\n\n3. **Right (R)**: to (7,2)\n   - x=7 is a wall.\n   - **Invalid**.\n\n4. **Up (U)**: to (6,3)\n   - Reverse direction and (6,3) is a body segment.\n   - **Invalid**.\n\n**Choices**: Move Down to (6,1) or Left to (5,2) to eat the food.\n\n#### Option 1: Move Left to (5,2) to Eat Food\n- **Action**: L to (5,2)\n- **Effect**:\n  - Eat the food at (5,2): +1 score, snake length increases by 1.\n  - New head at (5,2), body includes (6,2), (6,3), etc., and the tail is not removed.\n  - New length: 13 segments.\n  - Direction: Left (L) since we moved left.\n\n#### Option 2: Move Down to (6,1)\n- **Action**: D to (6,1)\n- **Effect**:\n  - No food eaten.\n  - New head at (6,1), body shifts, tail removed.\n  - Length remains 12.\n  - Direction: Down (D).\n\n### Evaluating the Options\n**Option 1 (Eat at (5,2))**:\n- Immediate score gain.\n- Snake grows, which might limit future mobility but in this case, there's still space.\n- The food at (5,2) is safe to eat now (tail is not adjacent when eating).\n\n**Option 2 (Move Down to (6,1))**:\n- Delays eating the food.\n- Explores more space first.\n- Can still eat the food later (life span is long enough).\n\n**Decision**: Since eating the food is safe and beneficial now, and the other food at (1,4) is unreachable, it's better to eat at (5,2) at Turn 56.\n\n### Subsequent Moves After Eating (Turns 57+)\nAfter eating at (5,2) at Turn 56:\n\n- **Head at (5,2)**, direction Left.\n- Possible moves at Turn 57:\n  - Left (L) to (4,2)\n    - Valid (not wall, obstacle, or body).\n  - Down (D) to (5,1)\n    - Valid.\n  - Up (U) to (5,3)\n    - Obstacle (5,3) is blocked.\n  - Right (R) to (6,2)\n    - Reverse direction, invalid.\n  \nBest to continue left to explore open space: **L to (4,2)**.\n\nAt Turn 58, head at (4,2), direction Left:\n- Possible moves:\n  - Left (L) to (3,2)\n  - Down (D) to (4,1)\n  - Up (U) to (4,3)\n  \nChoose **L to (3,2)** to continue leftward.\n\n### Final Action Sequence\nBased on the above reasoning, the optimal action sequence starting at Turn 54 is:\n\n1. **Turn 54**: D (only possible move)\n2. **Turn 55**: D (only possible move)\n3. **Turn 56**: L (to eat the food at (5,2))\n4. **Turn 57**: L (to (4,2))\n5. **Turn 58**: L (to (3,2))\n\n### Main Thinking Conclusion\nPrioritized eating the accessible positive food at (5,2) on turn 56 to gain an immediate score increase and snake growth, then committed to moving leftward toward the open bottom-left area to avoid potential dead ends and ensure long-term survival, as the other food at (1,4) was unreachable within its remaining lifespan.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\boxed{\nTurn 54: D \\\\\nTurn 55: D \\\\\nTurn 56: L \\\\\nTurn 57: L \\\\\nTurn 58: L\n}",

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State\n\nFirst, let's summarize the current state at Turn 75 based on the provided information:\n\n- **Snake Positions**: The snake's body is represented by a list of coordinates starting from the head at (3,2) to the tail at (3,3). The full path is:\n  - Head: (3,2)\n  - Body: (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3) (Tail)\n\n- **Snake Head Direction**: The snake's head is currently moving left (L), meaning it moved from (4,2) to (3,2) in the previous turn.\n\n- **Food Items**:\n  - (5,1): value = 1, life_span = 3 (will disappear after Turn 77)\n  - (6,4): value = 1, life_span = 8 (will disappear after Turn 82)\n\n- **Walls and Obstacles**:\n  - Border walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.\n  - Internal obstacles at: (3,6), (2,1), (1,3), (2,3), (5,6), (5,3), (5,4), (1,6)\n\n### Possible Moves from Current Position (3,2)\n\nGiven the snake's current direction is left (L), the possible moves from (3,2) are:\n\n1. **Up (U)**: (3,3)\n   - Check for collision: (3,3) is the tail. Normally, moving into the tail is safe because the tail will move away unless the snake eats food (which would make the tail stay). Here, we're not eating food by moving to (3,3), so it's safe.\n   \n2. **Down (D)**: (3,1)\n   - Check for collision: (3,1) is not occupied by the snake's body and is not a wall. It's a valid move.\n   \n3. **Left (L)**: (2,2)\n   - Check for collision: (2,2) is not occupied by the snake's body. Check for walls: (2,1) is a wall, but (2,2) is not listed as a wall. So, it's a valid move.\n   \n4. **Right (R)**: (4,2)\n   - However, since the current direction is left, moving right would be an instant reverse, which is not allowed. So, R is invalid.\n\nThus, valid immediate moves are U, D, or L.\n\n### Evaluating Each Move\n\n**1. Move Up (U) to (3,3):**\n   - This moves the head to the current tail position. Since we're not eating, the tail will move forward, and the new tail will be (3,4).\n   - After moving:\n     - New head: (3,3)\n     - New body: (3,2), (4,2), ..., (3,4) (tail moves away)\n   - Next possible moves from (3,3):\n     - U: (3,4) - occupied by the new tail (but tail moves away, so depends on whether it's still occupied)\n     - D: (3,2) - body\n     - L: (2,3) - wall\n     - R: (4,3) - need to check\n   - This seems like it might lead to limited options soon.\n\n**2. Move Down (D) to (3,1):**\n   - (3,1) is free.\n   - After moving:\n     - New head: (3,1)\n     - New body: (3,2), (4,2), ..., (3,4) (tail moves away)\n   - Next possible moves from (3,1):\n     - U: (3,2) - body\n     - D: (3,0) - wall\n     - L: (2,1) - wall\n     - R: (4,1) - free\n   - Only R to (4,1) is possible next.\n   - From (4,1), next moves could be towards (5,1) which has food, but that leads to a dead end as per the previous analysis.\n\n**3. Move Left (L) to (2,2):**\n   - (2,2) is free.\n   - After moving:\n     - New head: (2,2)\n     - New body: (3,2), (4,2), ..., (3,4) (tail moves away)\n   - Next possible moves from (2,2):\n     - U: (2,3) - wall\n     - D: (2,1) - wall\n     - L: (1,2) - free\n     - R: (3,2) - body\n   - Only L to (1,2) is possible.\n   - From (1,2), next moves:\n     - U: (1,3) - wall\n     - D: (1,1) - free\n     - L: (0,1) - wall\n     - R: (2,2) - body\n   - Only D to (1,1).\n   - From (1,1), next moves:\n     - U: (1,2) - body\n     - D: (1,0) - wall\n     - L: (0,1) - wall\n     - R: (2,1) - wall\n     - Dead end.\n\nThis path also leads to a dead end but may take slightly longer than moving down.\n\n### Considering Food\n\n- **(5,1)**: Life span until Turn 77. Currently Turn 75, so 2 turns left. It's risky to go for it as it leads to a dead end.\n- **(6,4)**: Currently under the snake's body at (6,4). After the snake moves, (6,4) will be vacated and the food can be eaten if the head moves there in future turns. Life span until Turn 82, so plenty of time.\n\nGiven that (6,4) will be free after this turn, it might be better to position the snake to potentially reach it in future turns.\n\n### Optimal Immediate Move\n\nGiven the options:\n\n- Moving Up (U) to (3,3) seems the safest as it doesn't immediately lead to a dead end and keeps more options open for future moves towards (6,4).\n- Moving Down (D) or Left (L) both lead to dead ends relatively quickly.\n\nHowever, moving Up to (3,3) is moving towards the tail, which is safe because the tail will move away (since we're not eating). This might allow more flexibility in future moves to navigate towards the (6,4) food.\n\n### Verifying Future Moves After U to (3,3)\n\nAfter moving to (3,3):\n\n- New head: (3,3)\n- New body: (3,2), (4,2), ..., (3,4) (tail was at (3,3), now moves away to (3,4))\n  \nFrom (3,3), possible moves:\n\n- U: (3,4) - currently the new tail, but tail moves away unless we eat. If we don't eat, it's safe.\n- D: (3,2) - body\n- L: (2,3) - wall\n- R: (4,3) - free\n\nSo, next move could be U to (3,4) or R to (4,3).\n\n- Moving R to (4,3):\n  - From (4,3), can move towards (6,4) in future turns.\n\nThis seems more promising than moving down or left.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe best immediate move is to go **Up (U)** to (3,3), as it avoids immediate dead ends and keeps the path open to potentially reach the (6,4) food in future turns.\n\n\\boxed{U}",

This is part of a forced sequence:\n  1. Turn 83: R to (3,5)\n  2. Turn 84: R to (4,5) (eat food)\n  3. Turn 85: R to (5,5)\n  4. Turn 86: R to (6,5)\n  5. Turn 87: From (6,5), the only non-lethal move is D to (6,4).\n  6. Turn 88: From (6,4), the only move is D to (6,3), which leads to a dead end.\n\nWhile this sequence eventually leads to a dead end, there is no better alternative at Turn 83.

The current head position is (6,4), direction is Down (D). \n\n**Possible Moves from (6,4), direction D**:\n1. **Up (U)**: (6,5) \n   - Opposite to current direction (D), so invalid (no instant reverse).\n2. **Down (D)**: (6,3)\n   - Check if (6,3) is valid:\n     - Not a wall or border (x=6,y=3 is within bounds).\n     - Not an internal obstacle (not listed).\n     - Not occupied by the snake's body: \n       - Current body segments: (6,5), (5,5), ..., (6,2). (6,3) is not in this list (it's the tail's previous position but now vacated).\n     - Valid move.\n3. **Left (L)**: (5,4)\n   - Check if (5,4) is valid:\n     - Not a wall or border.\n     - Internal obstacle: (5,4) is listed as an obstacle.\n     - Invalid move.\n4. **Right (R)**: (7,4)\n   - x=7 is a border wall.\n   - Invalid move.\n\n**Valid Moves**: Only Down (D) to (6,3).\n\n### Food Considerations\n\n- **(6,6)**: life_span=1 (will disappear after this turn if not eaten). \n  - Cannot be reached from (6,4) in one move (need to go up to (6,5) first, but that's opposite to current direction).\n- **(3,1)**: life_span=4 (available for turns 88,89,90,91).\n- **(2,5)**: life_span=7 (under body, need to vacate first).\n- **(6,3)**: life_span=10 (can be eaten if head moves there).\n\nHowever, moving to (6,3) does not eat any food (no food at (6,3) in the current state; the food at (6,3) has life_span=10, but it's not listed as present in the current state's food positions. Wait, looking back at the current state's food positions:\n- (6,6,1,1)\n- (3,1,4,1)\n- (2,5,7,1)\n- (6,3,10,1)\n\nSo (6,3) does have food with value=1, life_span=10. \n\nBut is (6,3) occupied by the snake's body? Current body positions: (6,5), (5,5), ..., (6,2). (6,3) is not in this list, so it's free and has food.\n\n**Eating (6,3)**:\n- Moving to (6,3) would eat the food there, increasing length by 1.\n- Need to check for Tail Reward Danger: Is the head adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food?\n  - Tail is at (6,2).\n  - Head is at (6,4), tail at (6,2): not adjacent (adjacent means directly next to, i.e., same x and y±1 or same y and x±1). Here, (6,4) and (6,2) are two apart vertically, so not adjacent.\n  - No Tail Reward Danger.\n\nThus, moving to (6,3) is safe and eats the food.\n\n### Decision\n\nGiven the valid moves:\n- Down (D) to (6,3): eats food, safe.\n- Other moves are invalid or don't eat food.\n\n**Best Action**: Move Down (D) to (6,3) to eat the food there.\n\n### Verifying Previous Plan\n\nThe previous plan suggested moving Down (D) at turn 88, which aligns with this decision. The food at (6,3) was not considered in the previous plan's immediate steps, but it's a valid and beneficial move now.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{D}",

Cannot be reached in time (requires 2 moves, but only available for 1 more turn after current).\n2. **(2, 5)**: Under body segment. Cannot be eaten unless it becomes the tail (not feasible soon).\n3. **(4, 6)**: Life span 10.

Not occupied by body (only (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5) are body segments).\n     - Safe.\n   - **Down (D)**: (3, 1)\n     - Not allowed (reverse of current direction U).\n   - **Left (L)**: (2, 2)\n     - Check: Not a wall or obstacle. Not occupied by body.\n     - Safe.\n   - **Right (R)**: (4, 2)\n     - Check: Occupied by body segment (4, 2) (not the tail), so collision.\n     - Not safe.\n\n3. **Food Analysis**:\n   - (2, 5): Value +1, life span 1 (disappears after this turn). Occupied by body, cannot be eaten this turn.\n   - (4, 6): Value +1, life span 6. Free, but not adjacent to head.\n   - (1, 5): Value +1, life span 9. Occupied by body, cannot be eaten this turn.\n   - No food can be eaten this turn.\n\n4. **Immediate Moves**:\n   - Possible safe moves: U to (3, 3) or L to (2, 2).\n   - Moving L to (2, 2) leads to a dead end (no further safe moves from (2, 2)).\n   - Moving U to (3, 3) allows more flexibility in future moves.\n\n### Decision:\n- **Action**: Move Up (U) to (3, 3) to avoid immediate dead ends and maintain flexibility for future moves.\n\n### Verification:\n- After moving U to (3, 3):\n  - New head position: (3, 3), direction U.\n  - Next possible moves from (3, 3): U to (3, 4) (tail, safe) or R to (4, 3) (free).\n  - This keeps options open for future food collection.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{U}",

Moving into the tail is allowed because the tail will move away unless the snake eats food.\n   - No food is at (3,4), so it's safe to move here without growing.\n   \n2. **Right (R)**: to (4,3)\n   - (4,3) is not occupied by the snake's body or an obstacle, so it's a valid move.\n   \n3. **Left (L)**: to (2,3)\n   - (2,3) is an internal obstacle, so this move is invalid.\n   \n4. **Down (D)**: to (3,2)\n   - This is the reverse of the current direction (U), which is not allowed.\n\nSo, the valid immediate moves are **U to (3,4)** or **R to (4,3)**.\n\n### Evaluating Move U to (3,4)\n\nIf we move U to (3,4):\n\n- New head position: (3,4)\n- The tail at (3,4) moves away, and the new tail becomes (2,4).\n- Next possible moves from (3,4):\n  - Current direction is U.\n  - Possible moves:\n    - U to (3,5): (3,5) is part of the body (segment 13), so collision.\n    - L to (2,4): (2,4) is the new tail, safe to move.\n    - R to (4,4): (4,4) is free.\n    - D to (3,3): Reverse, not allowed.\n  - So, can move L to (2,4) or R to (4,4).\n\nIf we choose L to (2,4):\n\n- New head at (2,4), direction L.\n- Next moves:\n  - U to (2,5): (2,5) is body, collision.\n  - D to (2,3): obstacle.\n  - L to (1,4): (1,4) is tail, safe.\n  - R to (3,4): reverse, not allowed.\n  - Only L to (1,4) is possible.\n  \nFrom (1,4):\n\n- Direction L.\n- Next moves:\n  - U to (1,5): (1,5) has food and is tail. Moving here would eat the food, causing the snake to grow, and the head would collide with the new tail (since the tail doesn't move when eating), resulting in death.\n  - Other moves are invalid or lead to walls/obstacles.\n  - So, moving U to (1,5) is deadly.\n\nThus, moving U then L leads to death at turn 98.\n\nAlternatively, from (3,4), move R to (4,4):\n\n- New head at (4,4), direction R.\n- Next moves:\n  - U to (4,5): body, collision.\n  - D to (4,3): free.\n  - L to (3,4): reverse, not allowed.\n  - R to (5,4): obstacle.\n  - Only D to (4,3) is possible.\n  \nFrom (4,3):\n\n- Direction D.\n- Next moves:\n  - U to (4,4): reverse, not allowed.\n  - D to (4,2): body, collision.\n  - L to (3,3): body, collision.\n  - R to (5,3): obstacle.\n  - No possible moves, death at turn 98.\n\nSo, moving U then R also leads to death at turn 98.\n\n### Evaluating Move R to (4,3)\n\nIf we move R to (4,3):\n\n- New head position: (4,3), direction R.\n- Next possible moves:\n  - U to (4,4): free.\n  - D to (4,2): body, collision.\n  - L to (3,3): reverse, not allowed.\n  - R to (5,3): obstacle.\n  - Only U to (4,4) is possible.\n  \nFrom (4,4):\n\n- Direction U.\n- Next moves:\n  - U to (4,5): body, collision.\n  - D to (4,3): reverse, not allowed.\n  - L to (3,4): body, collision.\n  - R to (5,4): obstacle.\n  - No possible moves, death at turn 98.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth initial moves (U or R) lead to the snake's death within 2 turns (by turn 98). There is no sequence of moves that allows the snake to survive beyond this point given the current configuration and constraints.\n\nHowever, moving U to (3,4) at least allows for a choice at the next turn (either L or R), whereas moving R to (4,3) forces the snake into a dead end immediately after. \n\nGiven that both paths lead to imminent death, the choice between U and R doesn't significantly impact the outcome. However, moving U to (3,4) might slightly delay the inevitable by allowing one more turn of movement before death.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nGiven the analysis, the immediate action at turn 96 is to move **Up (U)** to (3,4).\n\n\\boxed{U}",

instead, a new segment is added at the previous tail position (2,5).\n\n**New Snake Positions After Turn 99**:\n- Head: (1,5)\n- Body: [(1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,5)]\n   - Note: The tail is now at (2,5), and since we ate food, the tail remains, effectively having two segments at (2,5) temporarily.\n- Length: 18 (same as initial, since we ate one food and lost one segment earlier).\n\n### Possible Moves at Turn 100\n\nNow, the head is at (1,5), and the direction is Up (since we moved Up in the previous turn).\n\nAdjacent cells from (1,5):\n\n1. **Up (U) to (1,6)**:\n   - (1,6) is a wall (internal obstacle), so invalid.\n\n2. **Down (D) to (1,4)**:\n   - (1,4) is occupied by the snake's body (first segment after head), so invalid.\n   - Also, Down is the opposite of the current direction (Up), which is not allowed (no instant reverse).\n\n3. **Left (L) to (0,5)**:\n   - (0,5) is a border wall (x=0), so invalid.\n\n4. **Right (R) to (2,5)**:\n   - (2,5) is occupied by the snake's body (two segments here due to growth), so moving here would cause a collision.\n\n**Valid Moves at Turn 100**: None. All possible moves lead to walls or body collisions.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAt Turn 98, the only valid move is Left (L) to (1,4). Then at Turn 99, the only valid move is Up (U) to (1,5) to eat the food. However, this leads to a dead end at Turn 100 with no possible moves, resulting in the snake's death.\n\nGiven that there are no alternative paths that allow the snake to survive beyond Turn 100, the optimal immediate actions are to move Left at Turn 98 and Up at Turn 99 to gain the +1 score from the food at (1,5) before the inevitable death.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{L}",

This is unavoidable in the current state.\n\n\\boxed{U}",
