No internal obstacle at (2,3).\n   - Check for food: (2,3) has food.\n     - It's positive food (+1).\n     - Since the snake is only the head, eating it will make the snake grow to length 2.\n     - No tail to worry about, so no Tail Reward Danger.\n   - **Conclusion**: Safe and beneficial.\n\n2. **Move Up (U)**:\n   - New head position: (3, 3+1) = (3,4)\n   - Check for walls: Within bounds.\n   - Check for food: No food at (3,4).\n   - **Conclusion**: Safe but no immediate reward.\n\n3. **Move Down (D)**:\n   - New head position: (3, 3-1) = (3,2)\n   - Check for walls: Within bounds.\n   - Check for food: No food at (3,2).\n   - **Conclusion**: Safe but no immediate reward.\n\n### Comparing Options\n\n- **Left (L)**: Immediate reward (+1 score, snake grows).\n- **Up (U) / Down (D)**: No immediate reward.\n\nSince the goal is to maximize score, moving Left to eat the food at (2,3) seems optimal.\n\n### Potential Risks\n\n- **Tail Reward Danger**: Not applicable here since the snake has no tail yet.\n- **Wall Collision**: Already checked, no issue.\n- **Body Collision**: Only one segment, no risk.\n\n### Verifying Food Mechanics\n\n- The food at (2,3) is under the snake's body? No, the snake is only at (3,3). So, it's not under the body.\n- The food is adjacent to the head. Since the head is moving onto it, it's a valid move.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe best immediate action is to move Left to (2,3) to eat the positive food.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{L}",

To reach (2,1), need to move down twice.\n   - Next move: D to (2,2), then D to (2,1).\n   - But food life_span is 1, so after this turn, it disappears. Thus, can't reach it in time.\n\n2. **(3,1)**:\n   - Current head at (2,3). Path: D to (2,2), then L/R to (3,2), then D to (3,1).\n   - Again, life_span is 1, can't reach in time.\n\n3. **(1,1)**:\n   - Current head at (2,3). Path: L to (1,3), then D to (1,2), then D to (1,1).\n   - Life_span is 1, can't reach in time.\n\n### Conclusion on Food\n\nAll food items will disappear after this turn because their life_span is 1, and none can be reached in a single move. Therefore, the immediate goal shifts to positioning the snake for future opportunities while avoiding collisions.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Danger\n\n- **Tail Collision**: The tail is at (3,3). The head is at (2,3). The tail is to the right of the head. Moving Left is safe because the tail will move forward (to where the head was, (2,3)), and the new head position (1,3) doesn't overlap with the new tail position.\n  \n- **Wall Collision**: Moving Left to (1,3) is safe as x=1 is not a wall.\n\n### Optimal Move\n\nGiven that:\n- Moving Left (L) is safe and maintains the current direction.\n- Moving Up (U) or Down (D) are also safe but don't provide immediate benefits.\n- No food can be eaten this turn.\n\nThe best strategy is to continue moving Left to keep the snake's movement consistent and avoid unnecessary direction changes that might limit future options.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter evaluating all options, the safest and most reasonable move is to continue moving Left.\n\n\\boxed{L}",

        "thinking": "Alright, let's tackle this Snake game scenario step by step. I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake at Turn 2.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The grid is 8x8 (since x and y range from 0 to 7).\n2. **Walls**:\n   - Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So, the snake cannot move to any cell where x is 0 or 7, or y is 0 or 7.\n   - Internal obstacle: (5,6). The snake cannot move to this cell.\n3. **Snake**:\n   - Positions: Head at (1,3), body at (2,3). So, the snake is two segments long, moving left (direction L).\n4. **Food**:\n   - (2,1): value=8, life_span=1\n   - (3,1): value=8, life_span=1\n   - (1,1): value=9, life_span=1\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nThe snake is currently moving left (L). The possible moves are Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R), but we cannot instantly reverse the direction (i.e., cannot go Right since that's opposite to Left).\n\nSo, possible moves: U, D, L.\n\nLet's evaluate each:\n\n#### 1. Move Left (L)\n- Current head: (1,3)\n- Move left: (0,3)\n   - x=0 is a border wall. **Invalid move** (collision with wall).\n\n#### 2. Move Up (U)\n- Current head: (1,3)\n- Move up: (1,4)\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Body: Snake body is at (2,3). (1,4) is not part of the body. Safe.\n     - Walls: y=4 is not a border wall (y=7 is the upper border). No internal obstacles at (1,4). Safe.\n   - Check for food:\n     - Is (1,4) a food position? No. The food positions are (2,1), (3,1), (1,1).\n   - Outcome: Moves to (1,4), no food eaten, snake length remains 2.\n\n#### 3. Move Down (D)\n- Current head: (1,3)\n- Move down: (1,2)\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Body: (2,3) is the body, (1,2) is not part of it. Safe.\n     - Walls: y=2 is not a border wall. No internal obstacles at (1,2). Safe.\n   - Check for food:\n     - Is (1,2) a food position? No.\n   - Outcome: Moves to (1,2), no food eaten, snake length remains 2.\n\n### Evaluating Food Options\n\nCurrently, none of the immediate moves lead to food. But let's see if any food is adjacent to the head that we can aim for in future moves.\n\nCurrent head: (1,3)\nAdjacent cells:\n- Up: (1,4) - no food\n- Down: (1,2) - no food\n- Left: (0,3) - wall\n- Right: (2,3) - body\n\nNo adjacent food right now. The closest foods are:\n- (2,1): distance is |2-1| + |1-3| = 1 + 2 = 3\n- (3,1): distance is 2 + 2 = 4\n- (1,1): distance is 0 + 2 = 2\n\n(1,1) is the closest. Let's see how to reach it:\n\nFrom (1,3):\n- Down to (1,2)\n- Then down to (1,1) - but need to check if we can do that without dying.\n\nBut at (1,2), next move down to (1,1):\n- Snake would be: head at (1,1), body at (1,2), tail at (1,3) is gone (since length is 2).\n- But food at (1,1) is under the head. Can we eat it?\n   - Food under snake's body can only be eaten if:\n     1. Body moves away: Here, body is at (1,2), moving to (1,1) means head is on (1,1), which is where food is. Body was at (1,2), now moving to (1,1), so body is moving onto food, not away. So cannot eat yet.\n   - Need to move body away first. Maybe:\n     - From (1,3), down to (1,2)\n     - Then left to (0,2) - but x=0 is wall. Can't.\n     - Then right to (2,2)\n        - Then down to (2,1) - but that's another food.\n     Seems complicated to reach (1,1) safely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe aim for (2,1):\nFrom (1,3):\n- Down to (1,2)\n- Right to (2,2)\n- Down to (2,1) - can eat here if food is still there.\n\nBut life_span of foods is 1, meaning they disappear after this turn (since countdown decreases every turn including current). So at turn 2, life_span=1 means they disappear after this turn, so they're gone at turn 3.\n\nThus, we cannot reach any food in this turn's move, as all foods will disappear after this turn.\n\n### Best Immediate Action\n\nSince we cannot reach any food in this move (and they'll disappear next turn), the priority is to stay alive and position for future food.\n\nCurrent possible safe moves: U or D.\n\nBetween U and D:\n- Moving U to (1,4): no immediate benefit, but opens space.\n- Moving D to (1,2): closer to where some food was (though disappearing), but no immediate benefit.\n\nBoth are equally safe with no immediate advantage. Maybe prefer moving towards the center for better future options.\n\n(1,4) is closer to the top (y=7), (1,2) is closer to bottom (y=0). Maybe prefer moving down to stay away from walls longer.\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nTail is at (2,3). Adjacent to head (1,3) are:\n- Left: (0,3) - wall\n- Right: (2,3) - tail\n- Up: (1,4)\n- Down: (1,2)\n\nTail is adjacent to head at (2,3). Is there positive food at tail?\nFood positions are (2,1), (3,1), (1,1). None at (2,3). So no danger from tail reward.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nBoth U and D are safe. Let's choose D to move towards the center.\n\n\\boxed{D}",

There's also an internal obstacle at (5,6).\n2. **Snake State**:\n   - Positions: Head at (1,2), body segment at (1,3).\n   - Current direction: Down (D).\n3. **Food Items**:\n   - (2,1): value=7, life_span=1.\n   - (3,1): value=7, life_span=1.\n   - (1,1): value=8, life_span=1.\n\n### Snake Movement Basics\n\nThe snake moves one cell per turn in one of four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). The key constraints are:\n- **No instant reverse**: Since the current direction is D, the snake cannot move U in the next turn.\n- **Collision rules**:\n  - **Body collision**: The head cannot touch any body segment except the tail, because the tail moves forward.\n  - **Wall collision**: Cannot move into any wall or border cell.\n\n### Current Snake Position Analysis\n\n- **Head**: (1,2)\n- **Body**: (1,3)\n\nPossible moves from (1,2):\n1. **Down (D)**: (1,1)\n   - Check if (1,1) is a wall or body.\n   - Walls: y=0 is a border, but y=1 is not.\n   - Body: The only body segment is at (1,3), so no collision.\n   - Food: (1,1) has food with value=8.\n   - **Tail Reward Danger**: The tail is at (1,3). The head is not adjacent to the tail (since (1,3) is not adjacent to (1,2) in terms of immediate next move, but the tail is at (1,3) and the head is moving to (1,1). The tail is not adjacent to (1,1), so no danger here.\n   - **Conclusion**: Valid move, and it leads to eating high-value food (8).\n\n2. **Left (L)**: (0,2)\n   - Check walls: x=0 is a border.\n   - **Conclusion**: Invalid, as it's a wall.\n\n3. **Right (R)**: (2,2)\n   - Check walls: x=2 is not a border.\n   - Check body: No body segment at (2,2).\n   - Food: No food at (2,2).\n   - **Conclusion**: Valid move, but no immediate reward.\n\n4. **Up (U)**: (1,3)\n   - Check body: The body segment is at (1,3).\n   - **Conclusion**: Invalid, as it would collide with the body.\n\n### Food Analysis\n\nLooking at the food items:\n1. **(2,1)**: value=7, life_span=1.\n   - Current turn is 3, so it disappears at turn 4.\n   - To reach (2,1) from (1,2), the snake needs to move R to (2,2) and then D to (2,1).\n   - But the food's life_span is 1, meaning it will disappear next turn. So, it's not reachable in one move.\n\n2. **(3,1)**: value=7, life_span=1.\n   - Similar to above, not reachable in one move.\n\n3. **(1,1)**: value=8, life_span=1.\n   - Reachable in one move by going D to (1,1).\n   - Since life_span is 1, it will disappear next turn if not eaten now.\n\n### Decision Making\n\nGiven the options:\n- **D (Down)**: Leads to (1,1), eats food with value=8.\n- **R (Right)**: Leads to (2,2), no immediate reward but opens up future options.\n\n**Pros of D**:\n- Immediate high reward (8 points).\n- No collision risk.\n- Food will disappear next turn, so it's now or never.\n\n**Cons of D**:\n- After eating, the snake grows, but the next move options might be limited.\n\n**Pros of R**:\n- Keeps options open.\n- Can plan for future food.\n\n**Cons of R**:\n- Misses the high-value food at (1,1).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe immediate action should prioritize eating the high-value food at (1,1) since it's the only one that can be eaten in this turn and provides the highest reward. The other foods are not reachable in one move and will disappear before the snake can reach them.\n\n### Verification\n\n- **No instant reverse**: Current direction is D, so moving U is invalid, but D is allowed.\n- **Collision check**: Moving D to (1,1) doesn't collide with any walls or body segments.\n- **Tail Reward Danger**: The tail is at (1,3), and the head is moving to (1,1). The tail is not adjacent to (1,1), so no danger.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe best immediate action is to move Down (D) to eat the food at (1,1).\n\n\\boxed{D}",

(3,1) and (1,3):\n       - Distance: |3-1| + |1-3| = 2 + 2 = 4. Not adjacent (adjacent means distance of 1).\n     - So, no danger from tail reward.\n   - **Conclusion**: Safe to eat, +1 score.\n\n2. **Move Up (U) to (2,2)**:\n   - (2,2) has no food listed.\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Body segments: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3). (2,2) is not any of these.\n     - No wall at (2,2).\n   - **Tail Reward Danger**:\n     - Not applicable since no food is eaten.\n   - **Conclusion**: Safe move, but no score gain.\n\n### Comparing Moves\n\n- **Right (R)**: +1 score, safe.\n- **Up (U)**: No score, safe.\n\nClearly, moving Right is better as it gains us a point without any immediate danger.\n\n### Checking for Other Considerations\n\n- **Food Life Span**:\n  - Food at (3,1): life span = 5. Current turn is 5, so it will disappear after this turn if not eaten now.\n  - Food at (1,6): life span = 9, so it will stay for more turns.\n  \nSince the food at (3,1) is about to disappear, it's now or never to eat it.\n\n- **Future Moves**:\n  - If we eat at (3,1), next turn the head is at (3,1), and the body will be [(3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2)].\n  - Possible moves from (3,1):\n    - Current direction would be R (since we moved R last time).\n    - Can't move L (opposite of R).\n    - Possible: R (4,1), U (3,2), D (3,0) — but D is wall.\n    - From (3,1), moving R to (4,1) seems safe (no food there currently), or U to (3,2) also safe.\n    - There's food at (1,6), but it's far away; we might plan a path towards it later.\n\n### Potential Risks\n\n- After moving to (3,1), the snake's body will be longer, making it slightly more prone to self-collision in future moves, but currently no immediate risk.\n  \n### Final Decision\n\nGiven that moving Right:\n- Gains us +1 score.\n- The food is about to disappear.\n- No immediate dangers or collisions.\n  \nMoving Up is safe but doesn't give any benefit now.\n\nTherefore, the best immediate action is to move **Right (R)**.\n\n\\boxed{R}",

But the head is at (3,1), and the food is at (1,6), which is not adjacent to the head (adjacent means Δx + Δy = 1, but here it's |3-1| + |1-6| = 2 + 5 = 7). So, we cannot eat the food this turn regardless of our move.\n\nTherefore, the food will disappear after this turn, and we cannot eat it.\n\n### Checking for Other Foods\n\nOnly one food is present, so no other food to consider.\n\n### Avoiding Risks\n\nNow, let's ensure that the moves don't lead to immediate danger:\n\n1. **Move Right (R) to (4,1)**:\n   - Next possible moves from (4,1):\n     - Continue R to (5,1): Check (5,1):\n       - Not a wall, not obstacle (obstacle is at (5,6)), not in body.\n     - Up to (4,2): Valid.\n     - Down to (4,0): Wall at y=0 → invalid.\n     - Left to (3,1): Opposite of R (current move is R), so invalid next move.\n   - So from (4,1), can go R or U next turn.\n\n2. **Move Up (U) to (3,2)**:\n   - Next possible moves from (3,2):\n     - Continue U to (3,3): Valid.\n     - Right to (4,2): Valid.\n     - Left to (2,2): Valid (not opposite since current is U).\n     - Down to (3,1): Opposite of U → invalid.\n   - More options next turn.\n\nBoth moves seem safe for now.\n\n### Considering Future Moves\n\nSince we can't eat the food now, let's think about positioning for future food spawns or avoiding getting trapped.\n\n- Moving Right (R) to (4,1):\n  - Moves the snake towards the right side of the grid.\n  - Potential to go up or right next turn.\n\n- Moving Up (U) to (3,2):\n  - Moves the snake upwards, more central.\n  - More options next turn (U, R, L).\n\nMoving Up seems to give more flexibility for future moves.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger Check\n\nIs there any food under the tail that could be dangerous if eaten?\n\nTail is at (1,3). Is there food at (1,3)? No, food is at (1,6). So no danger from tail reward.\n\n### Decision\n\nGiven that:\n\n1. Cannot eat the current food this turn (too far, life_span=1).\n2. Both R and U are valid immediate moves.\n3. Moving Up provides more flexibility for next moves.\n4. No immediate dangers in either move.\n\n**Choice**: Move Up (U) to (3,2).\n\n\\boxed{U}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action to take at turn \\( t_0 = 7 \\).\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**1. Grid and Walls:**\n- The grid is bounded by walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So, the playable area is from x=1 to x=6 and y=1 to y=6.\n- There's an internal obstacle at (5, 6), which the snake cannot move into.\n\n**2. Snake:**\n- Positions: Head is at (3, 2), followed by body segments at (3, 1), (2, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2).\n- Current direction: Up (U). This means the last move was upwards, so the snake moved from (3,1) to (3,2).\n\n**3. Food:**\n- Two pieces of food:\n  - (1, 6): value = 1 (positive), life_span = 7\n  - (3, 5): value = 1 (positive), life_span = 10\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (3,2) and direction U, the possible moves are U, L, R (can't go D because that's the opposite of U, which is not allowed).\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n**1. Move Up (U) to (3,3):**\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: y=7 is the upper wall, (3,3) is within bounds.\n  - Body: Check if (3,3) is in the snake's body. Current body positions are (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2). (3,3) is not in the body.\n  - Obstacles: (5,6) is not (3,3).\n- Food at (3,3)? No, no food there.\n- Outcome: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n**2. Move Left (L) to (2,2):**\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: x=0 is the left wall, (2,2) is within bounds.\n  - Body: (2,2) is not in the current body positions.\n  - Obstacles: (5,6) is not (2,2).\n- Food at (2,2)? No.\n- Outcome: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n**3. Move Right (R) to (4,2):**\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: x=7 is the right wall, (4,2) is within bounds.\n  - Body: (4,2) is not in the current body positions.\n  - Obstacles: (5,6) is not (4,2).\n- Food at (4,2)? No.\n- Outcome: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n### Evaluating Food\n\nNow, let's see if any food is reachable soon or if we should plan to go towards food:\n\n- Food at (1,6):\n  - Distance from head (3,2): |3-1| + |2-6| = 2 + 4 = 6.\n  - Life_span = 7, current turn is 7, so it will disappear after this turn (since countdown decreases every turn including current).\n  - So, this food will disappear after this move; we can't reach it in this turn.\n\n- Food at (3,5):\n  - Distance from head (3,2): |3-3| + |2-5| = 0 + 3 = 3.\n  - Life_span = 10, so it will last until turn 17.\n  - To reach it, we can consider moving towards it.\n\nCurrently, moving U to (3,3) is a step towards (3,5). From (3,3), next could go U to (3,4), then U to (3,5).\n\n### Checking for Immediate Food\n\nIs there any food adjacent to the head that we can eat this turn?\n\nAdjacent cells to head (3,2):\n- U: (3,3) - no food\n- D: (3,1) - body segment, can't go there (would collide)\n- L: (2,2) - no food\n- R: (4,2) - no food\n\nNo immediate food to eat this turn.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger\n\nIs the head adjacent to the tail, and is there positive food on the tail cell?\n\nTail is at (1,2). Adjacent cells to tail: (0,2), (2,2), (1,1), (1,3).\nHead is at (3,2), which is not adjacent to (1,2) (distance is 2). So, no danger here.\n\n### Deciding the Best Move\n\nGiven that:\n- No immediate food to eat this turn.\n- Food at (3,5) is the only one that will persist, and moving U is a step towards it.\n- Moving L or R doesn't bring us closer to food immediately and doesn't have any immediate benefits.\n- Moving U is safe (no collisions).\n\nTherefore, the best immediate action is to move Up to position (3,3), aligning ourselves to reach the food at (3,5) in subsequent moves.\n\n### Verifying Other Moves\n\nJust to be thorough:\n- Moving L to (2,2): doesn't help in reaching any food directly.\n- Moving R to (4,2): similarly, not directly helpful unless there's a plan to go around, but currently no food in that direction.\n\nMoving U seems the most promising to eventually reach the food at (3,5).\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter evaluating all possibilities, the safest and most strategic move is to go Up.\n\n\\boxed{U}",

So, possible moves are U, L, R.\n\n### Evaluating Each Move\n\n1. **Up (U) to (3, 4)**:\n   - Check for walls: y=7 is the border, so (3,4) is within bounds.\n   - Check for obstacles: No internal obstacle at (3,4).\n   - Check for body collision: \n     - Snake body segments are at (3,2), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1). \n     - (3,4) is not in these, so no collision.\n   - Check for food: \n     - No food at (3,4).\n   - After moving, the new head is at (3,4), tail moves from (1,1) to (3,2), (3,1), (2,1).\n   - No immediate reward or penalty.\n\n2. **Left (L) to (2, 3)**:\n   - Check for walls: x=0 is the border, (2,3) is within bounds.\n   - Check for obstacles: No internal obstacle at (2,3).\n   - Check for body collision: \n     - (2,3) is not in the current body segments.\n   - Check for food: \n     - No food at (2,3).\n   - After moving, new head at (2,3), tail moves similarly.\n   - No immediate reward or penalty.\n\n3. **Right (R) to (4, 3)**:\n   - Check for walls: x=7 is the border, (4,3) is within bounds.\n   - Check for obstacles: No internal obstacle at (4,3).\n   - Check for body collision: \n     - (4,3) is not in the current body segments.\n   - Check for food: \n     - No food at (4,3).\n   - After moving, new head at (4,3), tail moves similarly.\n   - No immediate reward or penalty.\n\n### Considering Food\n\nCurrently, there are two foods:\n1. (1, 6): value = +1, life_span = 6.\n   - Distance from head (3,3): |1-3| + |6-3| = 2 + 3 = 5.\n   - It's quite far, and the snake would need to navigate around its own body to reach it.\n2. (3, 5): value = +1, life_span = 9.\n   - Distance from head (3,3): |3-3| + |5-3| = 0 + 2 = 2.\n   - Directly above the head at (3,5), which is two cells up.\n\nTo reach (3,5):\n- Current head at (3,3), next move Up to (3,4), then next move Up to (3,5).\n- But we need to ensure that after moving to (3,4), the path to (3,5) is safe.\n- After moving to (3,4), the body will be at (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (2,1), so (3,5) is safe to move to next.\n\nHowever, at turn \\( t_0 = 8 \\), the food at (3,5) has life_span = 9, meaning it will disappear at turn \\( t = 17 \\). We have enough time to reach it.\n\n### Avoiding Tail Reward Danger\n\nThe \"Tail Reward Danger\" rule states that if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nCurrently, the tail is at (1,1). The head is at (3,3), which is not adjacent to (1,1) (distance is 2 + 2 = 4). So no immediate danger here.\n\n### Immediate Decision\n\nGiven that moving Up (U) to (3,4) is safe and starts the path towards the food at (3,5), which is the closest positive food, this seems like the best immediate move.\n\nMoving Left or Right doesn't bring us closer to any food immediately and doesn't provide any immediate benefit.\n\n### Verifying Safety After Move Up\n\nAfter moving Up to (3,4):\n- New head: (3,4)\n- Body: (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (2,1)\n- Tail: (1,1) is removed, new tail is (3,2).\n\nNext possible moves from (3,4):\n- Up to (3,5) to eat the food.\n- Left to (2,4)\n- Right to (4,4)\n\nAll seem safe at that point.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe best immediate action is to move Up (U) to position (3,4), starting the path towards the positive food at (3,5).\n\n\\boxed{U}",

This means the playable area is from x=1 to x=6 and y=1 to y=6.\n   - There's an internal obstacle at (5, 6), which the snake cannot pass through.\n\n2. **Snake Position and Direction**:\n   - Snake's body segments are at: \n     - Head: (3, 4)\n     - Body: (3, 3), (3, 2), (3, 1), (2, 1)\n   - Current head direction is \"U\" (Up, which is increasing y-coordinate).\n\n3. **Food Items**:\n   - Food at (1, 6): value = +1, life_span = 5\n   - Food at (3, 5): value = +1, life_span = 8\n\n### Visualizing the Grid\n\nTo better visualize, let's sketch a simplified grid (from x=1 to x=6, y=1 to y=6):\n\n```\ny\\x | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6\n----|---|---|---|---|---|---\n6   | F |   |   |   | W | \n5   |   |   | F |   |   | \n4   |   |   | H |   |   | \n3   |   |   | B |   |   | \n2   |   |   | B |   |   | \n1   |   | B | B |   |   | \n```\n\n- H: Head at (3,4)\n- B: Body segments\n- F: Food\n- W: Wall at (5,6)\n\n### Possible Moves from Current Position\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However, it cannot reverse its direction immediately. Current direction is Up, so the opposite direction is Down, which is not allowed next.\n\nThus, possible moves are: U, L, R.\n\nLet's evaluate each:\n\n1. **Move Up (U) to (3,5)**:\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: (3,5) is within bounds (x=3, y=5 is valid).\n     - Body: Snake body is at [(3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (2,1)]. (3,5) is not in this list.\n   - Food at (3,5): Yes, there's positive food here.\n     - Eating it: \n       - Value: +1\n       - Length increases by 1.\n       - Check Tail Reward Danger: \n         - Current tail is at (2,1). \n         - After eating, new tail will be at (2,1) (since the tail moves forward, but the snake grows, so the tail position depends on how the body moves).\n         - Head moves to (3,5), body becomes [(3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (2,1)] + new segment from growth.\n         - New tail is still (2,1), but the head is at (3,5), which is not adjacent to (2,1). \n         - Distance between (3,5) and (2,1) is |3-2| + |5-1| = 1 + 4 = 5, not adjacent (adjacent means distance of 1).\n         - So no danger here.\n   - Safe to eat, gain +1.\n\n2. **Move Left (L) to (2,4)**:\n   - Check collisions:\n     - Walls: (2,4) is within bounds.\n     - Body: Not in [(3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (2,1)].\n   - Food: No food at (2,4).\n   - Safe move, no immediate reward.\n\n3. **Move Right (R) to (4,4)**:\n   - Check collisions:\n     - Walls: (4,4) is within bounds.\n     - Body: Not in body segments.\n   - Food: No food at (4,4).\n   - Safe move, no immediate reward.\n\n### Evaluating the Best Move\n\nWe have three options:\n\n1. **Up (U)**: Eat positive food at (3,5), gain +1, no danger.\n2. **Left (L)**: Safe, no reward.\n3. **Right (R)**: Safe, no reward.\n\nBetween these, moving Up to eat the positive food is the most beneficial as it increases the score and the snake's length without any immediate danger.\n\n### Checking for Potential Future Dangers\n\nWhile the immediate move is safe, let's briefly consider the next possible moves after eating the food at (3,5):\n\n- New head at (3,5), body: [(3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (2,1), (new segment)].\n- Next possible moves from (3,5), direction U:\n  - Can't reverse to D.\n  - Possible: U (to (3,6)), L (to (2,5)), R (to (4,5)).\n    - (3,6): y=6 is a wall (y=7 is wall, but y=6 is border? Wait, walls are at y=0/y=7, so y=6 is within bounds.\n    - But earlier, walls are at y=0/y=7, so y=6 is playable.\n    - No food at (3,6).\n    - No immediate danger.\n  - So after eating, we can continue moving safely.\n\n### Considering the Other Food\n\nThe other food is at (1,6), which is quite far from the current head position (3,4). It's not immediately reachable, and its lifespan is 5, which means it will disappear after 5 more turns (current turn is 9, so disappears at turn 14). \n\nGiven that, prioritizing the closer food at (3,5) is more efficient.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe best immediate action is to move Up to eat the positive food at (3,5), increasing the score and length safely.\n\n\\boxed{U}",

However:\n\n1. **Current Direction**: The snake is moving Up (\"U\").\n   - Opposite direction is Down (\"D\"), which is not allowed (no instant reverse).\n   - So, possible moves: U, L, R.\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n#### 1. Move Up (U) to (3,6):\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: (3,6) is not a wall (x=3, y=6 is within bounds, and not an internal wall).\n     - Body: Check if (3,6) is in the snake's body. Current body positions are (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (2,1). (3,6) is not in the body.\n   - Food at (3,6)? No food there.\n   - Outcome: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n#### 2. Move Left (L) to (2,5):\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: (2,5) is not a wall.\n     - Body: (2,5) is not in the body.\n   - Food at (2,5)? No food there.\n   - Outcome: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n#### 3. Move Right (R) to (4,5):\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: (4,5) is not a wall.\n     - Body: (4,5) is not in the body.\n   - Food at (4,5)? No food there.\n   - Outcome: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n### Evaluating Food Accessibility\n\nNow, let's see if any food is reachable in the next move:\n\n1. **Food at (1,6)**:\n   - Current head at (3,5).\n   - To reach (1,6) from (3,5):\n     - Need to move Left twice and Up once, or Up once and Left twice, but can't do that in one move.\n     - Not directly reachable in one move.\n\n2. **Food at (5,5)**:\n   - Current head at (3,5).\n   - To reach (5,5) from (3,5):\n     - Need to move Right twice, but can't do that in one move.\n     - Not directly reachable in one move.\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nThe tail is at (2,1). Is the head adjacent to the tail?\n\n- Head at (3,5), tail at (2,1).\n- Distance: |3-2|=1, |5-1|=4 → Not adjacent (adjacent means one coordinate differs by 1 and the other is same, or vice versa).\n- So, no tail reward danger here.\n\n### Determining the Best Move\n\nSince no food is immediately accessible in one move, the goal is to move towards food while avoiding collisions.\n\n**Food at (1,6)**:\n- Current head at (3,5).\n- To get closer: move Left (decrease x) or Up (increase y).\n  - Moving Left to (2,5) gets us closer in x-direction (from 3 to 2, towards 1).\n  - Moving Up to (3,6) gets us closer in y-direction (from 5 to 6, towards 6).\n\n**Food at (5,5)**:\n- Current head at (3,5).\n- To get closer: move Right (increase x).\n  - Moving Right to (4,5) gets us closer (from 3 to 4, towards 5).\n\nBetween the two foods:\n- (1,6) has a life_span of 4, (5,5) has a life_span of 10.\n- (1,6) will disappear sooner, so it's more urgent to eat it first if possible.\n\n**Possible Moves Towards (1,6)**:\n- Left to (2,5): gets us closer in x.\n- Up to (3,6): gets us closer in y.\n\nWhich is better?\n- After Left to (2,5), next move could be Left to (1,5), then Up to (1,6).\n- After Up to (3,6), next move could be Left to (2,6), then Left to (1,6).\n\nBoth sequences take two more moves to reach (1,6), but moving Left first seems more straightforward because it directly reduces the x-distance first.\n\n**Alternative Consideration**: Moving Right towards (5,5) is also safe, but (5,5) has a longer life_span, so it's less urgent.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Dangers\n\nIs there any immediate danger in moving Left, Up, or Right?\n\n- Moving Left to (2,5):\n  - Next possible moves from (2,5): Not Down (reverse), so Left, Up, Right.\n  - From (2,5), moving Left to (1,5) is safe (no walls or body there).\n  \n- Moving Up to (3,6):\n  - Next possible moves from (3,6): Not Down, so Left, Up, Right.\n  - From (3,6), moving Left to (2,6) is safe.\n\n- Moving Right to (4,5):\n  - Next possible moves from (4,5): Not Left, so Up, Down, Right.\n  - From (4,5), moving Right to (5,5) would eat the food there.\n\nWhile moving Right doesn't immediately eat food, it sets up for eating (5,5) next turn. However, (5,5) has a longer life_span, so prioritizing (1,6) seems better.\n\n### Decision\n\nGiven that (1,6) is more urgent (life_span=4), and moving Left gets us closer to it without immediate danger, the best immediate action is to move Left.\n\n**Potential Concerns**:\n- Is moving Left into a dead end? After moving to (2,5), we can go Left to (1,5), then Up to (1,6), which seems safe.\n- Alternatively, moving Up to (3,6) is also safe but doesn't directly help in reaching food faster.\n\n### Final Choice\n\nAfter evaluating all options, moving **Left (L)** seems the most strategic to approach the more urgent food at (1,6).\n\n\\boxed{L}",

Move Left (L) to (1,5)\n\n- **Position**: (1,5)\n- **Check for Collisions**:\n  - Walls: x=1 is not a wall (x=0 and x=7 are walls).\n  - Body: Check if (1,5) is in snake positions.\n    - Snake positions: (2,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1). (1,5) is not in this list.\n  - Safe to move here.\n- **Food Check**:\n  - No food at (1,5).\n  - Moving here doesn't eat any food.\n- **Tail Check**:\n  - Current tail is at (3,1). After moving, the tail will move forward, so the new tail will be at (3,5) (since the second segment is (3,5), which becomes the new tail after the head moves).\n  - No immediate danger from tail food since we're not eating anything.\n\n#### 2. Move Up (U) to (2,6)\n\n- **Position**: (2,6)\n- **Check for Collisions**:\n  - Walls: y=6 is not a wall (y=7 is).\n  - Body: (2,6) is not in snake positions.\n  - Safe to move here.\n- **Food Check**:\n  - Food at (1,6) is adjacent but not at (2,6).\n  - No food eaten here.\n- **Tail Check**:\n  - Same as above, no immediate danger.\n\n#### 3.

To reach (1,6):\n     - First move Up to (2,6), then Left to (1,6).\n     - Or first move Left to (1,5), then Up to (1,6).\n   - Life span is 3, and current turn is 11. Assuming it appeared at turn 8 (since 11 - 3 = 8), it will disappear after turn 11 (including current turn), so it's still there this turn but will disappear after.\n   - To eat it, we'd need to move towards it now.\n   - Moving Up to (2,6) gets us closer but doesn't eat it this turn.\n   - Moving Left to (1,5) doesn't help directly in eating (1,6).\n\n2. **Food at (5,5)**:\n   - Far from current head (2,5). Not immediately reachable.\n   - Life span is 9, so it will stay for a while.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger\n\nWe need to check if the tail has positive food that could be dangerous if eaten next.\n- Current tail is at (3,1). There's no food listed at (3,1), so no danger from tail food.\n\n### Best Immediate Action\n\nGiven that:\n- All three possible moves (L, U, D) are safe in terms of not colliding with walls or body.\n- None of the immediate moves lead to eating food this turn.\n- Food at (1,6) is about to disappear (after this turn), so moving towards it might not be beneficial since we can't eat it this turn.\n- Food at (5,5) is too far to consider for immediate action.\n\nTherefore, the safest move is to continue in the current direction (Left) to (1,5), as it doesn't lead to any immediate risks and keeps the snake moving safely.\n\n### Verifying No Better Option\n\nIs there a better move?\n- Moving Up to (2,6) gets closer to (1,6), but we can't eat it this turn, and it will disappear after this turn, so no benefit.\n- Moving Down to (2,4) doesn't provide any advantage over moving Left.\n\nThus, moving Left is the best choice.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter carefully evaluating all options, the best immediate action is to move Left.\n\n\\boxed{L}",

Distance from head to tail is not adjacent (head at (1,5), tail at (3,2)), so no tail reward danger.\n    - Eating this food: \n      - New length: current 6 +1 =7.\n      - New head at (1,6), body extends to include old head (1,5), then rest of body.\n      - Next turn, tail moves away from (3,2), so no immediate collision.\n- **Conclusion**: Safe to move Up and eat the food.\n\n#### 3.

However, since the current direction is U, the snake cannot instantly reverse to D (no instant reverse rule). So, possible moves are U, L, R.\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n#### 1. Move Up (U)\n- Current head: (1,6)\n- New head position: (1,6+1) = (1,7)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: y=7 is a border wall → collision! This is deadly.\n  \n**Conclusion**: Moving Up is invalid (wall collision).\n\n#### 2. Move Left (L)\n- Current head: (1,6)\n- New head position: (1-1,6) = (0,6)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: x=0 is a border wall → collision! Deadly.\n  \n**Conclusion**: Moving Left is invalid (wall collision).\n\n#### 3. Move Right (R)\n- Current head: (1,6)\n- New head position: (1+1,6) = (2,6)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: x=2 is not a wall; y=6 is not a wall. No border or internal walls at (2,6).\n  - Body segments: \n    - Current body positions: (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2)\n    - (2,6) is not in the body → no collision.\n  \n**Valid move**. Now, let's see if this move leads to eating food or has any other implications.\n\n#### Checking for Food at New Head Position (2,6)\n- Food positions: (5,5) and (4,5)\n- (2,6) is not a food position → no food eaten.\n\n#### Tail Reward Danger Check\nEven though we're not eating food, let's understand this rule for future reference:\n- If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake.\n- Current tail position: (3,2)\n- Adjacent to head (1,6)? \n  - Adjacent means one cell apart in any direction (including diagonals).\n  - Distance between (1,6) and (3,2): \n    - x-diff: 2, y-diff: 4 → not adjacent (adjacent would be max diff of 1 in x and y).\n- So, no tail reward danger here.\n\n### Other Considerations\n\nSince moving Right is the only valid move (Up and Left lead to wall collisions), we have to choose Right. \n\nBut let's think ahead to see if this move sets us up for future moves:\n\nAfter moving Right to (2,6), the new snake positions will be:\n- Head: (2,6)\n- Body: [(1,6), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3)]\n  - The tail (3,2) moves away, so the body is the previous head and body segments except the last one.\n\nThis seems safe. \n\n### Are There Better Options?\n\nWait, is there any way to reach food in future moves? \n\nCurrent food:\n1. (5,5): life_span = 7 (from turn 13, so disappears at turn 20)\n2. (4,5): life_span = 10 (disappears at turn 23)\n\nFrom (2,6), possible next moves:\n- Current direction would be R (since we moved R), so can't move L next.\n- From (2,6), to reach (4,5) or (5,5), we'd need to go down and right.\n\nBut right now, the only safe move is R to (2,6). \n\nAlternatively, is there any other move possible? Earlier, we saw only R is valid now. \n\n### Verifying No Other Moves\n\nWait, the initial possible moves were U, L, R (excluding D because it's reverse of U).

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action to take at Turn 14.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions and Walls**:\n   - The grid is 8x8 (from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7).\n   - Border walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.\n   - There's an internal obstacle at (5, 6).\n\n2. **Snake Details**:\n   - **Positions**: The snake's body is at [(2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3)].\n     - Head is at (2,6).\n     - Tail is at (3,3).\n   - **Current Direction**: The head is moving Right (R).\n\n3. **Food Items**:\n   - (5,5): value = 6, life_span = 1.\n   - (4,5): value = 9, life_span = 1.\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (2,6) moving Right (R), the possible moves are:\n- **Right (R)**: (3,6)\n- **Up (U)**: (2,7)\n- **Down (D)**: (2,5)\n\nCannot move Left (L) because that's the opposite of the current direction (R), which is not allowed.\n\n### Evaluating Possible Moves\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n1. **Move Right (R) to (3,6)**:\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: x=7 is the right border. (3,6) is within bounds.\n     - Obstacles: (5,6) is an obstacle, but (3,6) is not (5,6), so safe.\n     - Body: Snake body segments are at (1,6), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3). (3,6) is not in this list, so no body collision.\n   - Food: No food at (3,6).\n   - Outcome: Safe move, no immediate reward.\n\n2. **Move Up (U) to (2,7)**:\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: y=7 is the top border. Moving to (2,7) would hit the wall.\n   - Outcome: Wall collision → death. Not a good move.\n\n3. **Move Down (D) to (2,5)**:\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: y=0 is the bottom. (2,5) is within bounds.\n     - Body: Snake body segments include (2,5) (4th segment from head). Moving to (2,5) would collide with the body.\n     - However, the tail is at (3,3), and the segment at (2,5) is not the tail. Normally, colliding with any body segment is deadly, except if it's the tail and the tail moves away.\n     - Here, (2,5) is not the tail (tail is at (3,3)), so this is a body collision → death.\n   - Food: There is food at (4,5) and (5,5), but we're moving to (2,5), which has no food.\n   - Outcome: Body collision → death. Not a good move.\n\n### Re-evaluating Move Right (R)\n\nSince moving Right is the only non-lethal move, let's see if there's any strategic advantage or danger:\n\n- After moving Right to (3,6), the new head position is (3,6).\n- The tail is at (3,3), which will move forward to (3,4) (since the snake moves as a chain).\n- Next possible moves from (3,6):\n  - Right (R) to (4,6)\n  - Up (U) to (3,7) (but y=7 is a wall)\n  - Down (D) to (3,5) (body segment is there, but it's not the tail, so collision)\n  \nSo, after moving Right, the next move would likely be Right again to (4,6), which is safe.\n\n### Checking for Food Opportunities\n\nCurrent food:\n- (5,5): value = 6, life_span = 1 (will disappear next turn).\n- (4,5): value = 9, life_span = 1 (will disappear next turn).\n\nFrom (3,6), to reach (5,5):\n- Need to go Right to (4,6), then Down to (4,5), then Right to (5,5).\nBut (5,5) will disappear at turn 15, and we're at turn 14. So, it's not reachable in time.\n\nFrom (3,6), to reach (4,5):\n- Need to go Down to (3,5), but that's a body collision.\n- Or Right to (4,6), then Down to (4,5).\nBut (4,5) will disappear at turn 15, and we're at turn 14. So, we'd need to reach it by turn 14, which we can't from (3,6).\n\nThus, neither food is reachable before they disappear.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger Check\n\nIs the head adjacent to the tail with positive food on the tail?\n- Tail is at (3,3).\n- Head is at (2,6). Adjacent means one coordinate differs by 1.\n- Distance: |2-3| + |6-3| = 1 + 3 = 4. Not adjacent (adjacent would be distance 1).\nSo, no tail reward danger.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe only safe move is Right (R) to (3,6). Other moves lead to immediate death. The foods are not reachable before they disappear, so no immediate reward to consider.\n\n\\boxed{R}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**Current Turn**: 15  \n**Walls**:\n- Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (so the grid is 8x8 from (0,0) to (7,7))\n- Internal obstacle: (5,6) — can't move here\n\n**Snake Positions**: \n- Head: (3,6)\n- Body: [(2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (3,4)]\n  \nSo, the snake's body segments are:\n1. Head: (3,6)\n2. (2,6)\n3. (1,6)\n4. (1,5)\n5. (2,5)\n6. (3,5)\n7. Tail: (3,4)\n\n**Snake Head Direction**: R (Right) — last move was to the right.\n\n**Food**:\n1. (5,5): value = 5, life_span = 1\n2. (4,5): value = 8, life_span = 1\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (3,6), possible moves are:\n- Up (U): (3,7) — but y=7 is a wall, so invalid.\n- Down (D): (3,5) — currently occupied by the snake's body (3,5 is the 6th segment).\n- Left (L): (2,6) — currently occupied by the snake's body (2,6 is the 2nd segment).\n- Right (R): (4,6) — not occupied by body or walls.\n\nBut we also have the \"no instant reverse\" rule: the snake cannot move opposite to its current direction. Current direction is R (Right), so opposite is L (Left). So, Left is invalid this turn.\n\nSo, valid moves are:\n- Right (R): (4,6)\n- Up (U): (3,7) — but wall, so invalid.\n- Down (D): (3,5) — body collision, but let's check if it's safe.\n\nWait, is moving into (3,5) safe? Normally, moving into a body segment is deadly, but there's an exception: if it's the tail segment, and the tail will move away, it's safe. \n\nCurrent tail is (3,4). The segment before tail is (3,5). So (3,5) is not the tail; it's the second-to-last segment. So moving into (3,5) would collide with the body — deadly. So Down is invalid.\n\nThus, the only valid move is Right (R) to (4,6).\n\nBut let's check if there's any food to consider.\n\n### Food Analysis\n\nFood positions:\n1. (5,5): value=5, life=1\n2. (4,5): value=8, life=1\n\nOur head is at (3,6). Possible moves:\n- Right to (4,6): not directly towards any food.\n- Down to (3,5): deadly, as we saw.\n  \nIs there a way to reach food in future moves? \n\nFrom (4,6), next moves could be:\n- Down to (4,5) — which is the food (4,5) with value 8.\nBut is (4,5) safe to eat?\n\nCheck if (4,5) is under the snake's body: current body segments are (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (3,4). (4,5) is not in the body, so it's safe to eat directly if head moves there.\n\nBut currently, we can't move directly to (4,5) from (3,6); we'd have to go Right to (4,6), then Down to (4,5). \n\nBut the food at (4,5) has life_span=1, meaning it will disappear after this turn (since countdown decreases every turn, including current). So if we don't eat it this turn, it's gone.\n\nSimilarly, food at (5,5) also has life_span=1, so it will disappear after this turn unless eaten now.\n\nCan we eat any food this turn? \n\nCurrent head is at (3,6). Adjacent cells:\n- Right: (4,6) — no food\n- Down: (3,5) — body, can't go\n- Left: (2,6) — body, and reverse is forbidden\n- Up: (3,7) — wall\n\nSo we cannot eat any food this turn directly. Both foods will disappear after this turn.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger\n\nIs there any food under the tail? Tail is at (3,4). Is there food at (3,4)? No, food is at (5,5) and (4,5). So no danger from tail reward.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOnly valid move this turn is Right (R) to (4,6). We can't eat any food this turn, and moving Right is safe (no walls or body collision).\n\n\\boxed{R}",

These are the edges of the grid.\n- Internal obstacle: (5,6). This is a single cell that the snake cannot move into.\n\n**Snake**:\n- Positions (head first): [(4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5)]\n  - Head: (4,6)\n  - Body segments: (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5)\n  - Length: 7 segments.\n- Current direction: R (Right). This means the snake was moving to the right in the previous move.\n\n**Food**:\n1. (5,5): value = 4, life_span = 1\n   - This means it's positive food (+1 score, +1 length), will disappear after 1 more turn (including current turn).\n2. (4,5): value = 7, life_span = 1\n   - Positive food, disappears after this turn.\n3. (5,1): value = 10, life_span = 1\n   - Positive food, disappears after this turn.\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However:\n- **No instant reverse**: Since the current direction is R, the snake cannot move Left (L) next.\n  \nSo, possible moves: U, D, R.\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move.\n\n#### 1. Move Right (R)\n- New head position: (4+1,6) = (5,6)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: x=7 is a wall, but (5,6) is not a wall. However, (5,6) is an internal obstacle. So, moving here would collide with the wall.\n  - Body: Check if (5,6) is in the body segments. Current body: [(3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5)]. (5,6) is not in the body.\n- But since (5,6) is an internal obstacle, this move is invalid (deadly collision).\n\n**Conclusion**: Cannot move Right.\n\n#### 2. Move Up (U)\n- New head position: (4,6+1) = (4,7)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: y=7 is a border wall. So, (4,7) is a wall.\n  - Body: (4,7) is not in the body.\n- Moving to (4,7) would hit the wall.\n\n**Conclusion**: Cannot move Up.\n\n#### 3. Move Down (D)\n- New head position: (4,6-1) = (4,5)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: y=0 is a wall, but (4,5) is not a wall.\n  - Body: Check if (4,5) is in the body. Current body: [(3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5)]. (4,5) is not in the body.\n- Also, check if (4,5) has food:\n  - Food at (4,5): value=7, life_span=1 (positive food)\n    - Eating this food would increase length by 1 (new tail would be where the current tail is after moving).\n    - Check for Tail Reward Danger: Is the head adjacent to the tail, and is the tail cell has positive food?\n      - Current tail: (3,5)\n      - Adjacent cells to head (4,6): (4,7), (4,5), (3,6), (5,6)\n      - Tail is at (3,5), which is not adjacent to (4,6) (adjacent would be (3,6), (3,4), (2,5), (4,5)). Wait, actually, (3,5) is diagonally adjacent to (4,6), but in Snake, adjacency is typically up, down, left, right (no diagonals). So (3,5) is not adjacent to (4,6) in terms of movement.\n      - So no Tail Reward Danger here.\n    - So eating (4,5) is safe and beneficial.\n  \n**Conclusion**: Can move Down to (4,5) to eat positive food safely.\n\n#### 4. Move Left (L)\n- Not allowed because it's the opposite of current direction (R).\n\n### Evaluating Other Food Options\n\nOther food positions:\n- (5,5): To reach this, the snake would need to move Down to (4,5), then Right to (5,5). But (5,5) has life_span=1, meaning it will disappear after this turn. So we can't reach it in one move.\n- (5,1): Far away, life_span=1, can't reach in one move.\n\n### Best Immediate Action\n\nThe only safe and beneficial move is Down (D) to (4,5), eating the positive food there before it disappears.\n\n### Verifying Tail Movement After Eating\n\nAfter moving Down to (4,5) and eating:\n- New head: (4,5)\n- Current body: [(4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5)]\n- Normally, the tail would move forward (remove (3,5)), but since we ate food, length increases by 1, so tail stays at (3,5).\n- New snake: [(4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5)]\n- No immediate collision in next moves.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter evaluating all options, the best immediate action is to move Down (D).\n\n\\boxed{D}",

Move Down (D) to (4,4)\n- **Check for Walls**: y=4 is not a border wall (y=0 is the bottom wall), and there are no internal walls at (4,4).\n- **Check for Body Collision**:\n  - The snake's body segments are at: (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5).\n  - (4,4) is not in this list — safe.\n- **Food Check**: No food at (4,4).\n- **Outcome**: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n#### 2. Move Left (L) to (3,5)\n- **Check for Walls**: x=3 is not a border wall, and (3,5) is not an internal wall.\n- **Check for Body Collision**:\n  - (3,5) is the last segment of the snake's body (tail).\n  - Normally, moving into the tail is safe because the tail will move forward, but we must check for \"Tail Reward Danger\".\n- **Tail Reward Danger Check**:\n  - Is there positive food at the tail? The tail is at (3,5). Looking at food positions:\n    - (5,5) and (5,1) — no food at (3,5).\n  - Therefore, no danger from eating food at the tail.\n- **Outcome**: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n#### 3. Move Right (R) to (5,5)\n- **Check for Walls**:\n  - x=5 is not a border wall (x=7 is the right border).\n  - (5,6) is a wall, but we're moving to (5,5) — no wall there.\n- **Check for Body Collision**:\n  - (5,5) is not in the snake's body segments — safe.\n- **Food Check**:\n  - There is positive food at (5,5) with value +1 and life span 3.\n  - Eating it will increase the snake's length by 1.\n  - Need to check if eating this food causes a collision with the new tail.\n    - Current tail is at (3,5). After eating, the tail will not move, and the new segment will be added where the head was (4,5).\n    - New snake positions after eating: [(5,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5)].\n    - Next move, the tail (3,5) will move to where the second segment was (2,5), but since the head is at (5,5), no immediate collision.\n    - However, we must ensure that after growing, the head doesn't collide with the new tail in future moves.\n    - For the immediate next turn, no collision from this move.\n- **Outcome**: Safe move, eat positive food, score +1, length increases by 1.\n\n### Evaluating the Best Move\n\nWe have three safe moves:\n1. Down (D): No food, safe.\n2. Left (L): No food, safe.\n3. Right (R): Eat positive food, safe.\n\nThe goal is to maximize score by eating positive food when possible without risking collisions. Here, moving Right (R) allows us to eat the positive food at (5,5), which is beneficial.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Dangers After Eating\n\nAfter moving Right to (5,5) and eating the food:\n- New head position: (5,5).\n- New body: adds (4,5) at the front, rest follows.\n- Next turn, the tail (3,5) will move to (2,5), so no immediate collision.\n- The food at (5,5) will be gone (eaten), and the other food at (5,1) remains.\n\n### Considering the Other Food\n\nThe other food at (5,1) is further away with a life span of 9, so it's not urgent. The food at (5,5) has a life span of 3, meaning it will disappear in 3 turns (including this one), so it's better to eat it now if possible.\n\n### Verifying No Better Options\n\nIs there a better sequence where we don't eat now but can eat later? Not immediately obvious, as waiting might risk the food disappearing or the snake being in a less favorable position to eat it later.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nGiven the options, moving **Right (R)** to eat the positive food at (5,5) is the best immediate action to maximize the score without risking the snake's safety.\n\n\\boxed{R}",

So moving up would collide with the wall.\n   - **Not safe** - would collide with the internal obstacle at (5,6).\n\n3. **Move Down (D) to (5,4)**:\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: y=0 is a wall, but (5,4) is not a wall.\n     - Body: (5,4) is not in the body segments list.\n   - Safe to move down.\n   - Distance to food at (5,1): \n     - Moving from (5,5) to (5,4) gets us closer to the food at (5,1) vertically (from y=5 to y=4).\n\n### Considering the Food\n\nThe food is at (5,1) with value +1. It's currently at y=1, and our head is at y=5. Moving down gets us closer to the food.\n\nHowever, we should also consider if moving down could lead to a dead end or trap the snake. Let's see:\n\nAfter moving down to (5,4), the new head is at (5,4), and the tail moves forward, so the body segments will be:\n- New head: (5,4)\n- Body: (5,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (2,5)\n\nFrom (5,4), possible moves would be:\n- Left (L) to (4,4)\n- Right (R) to (6,4)\n- Down (D) to (5,3)\nCannot go Up (U) because that's opposite of down.\n\nThis seems safe for now, and continues to move towards the food.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Danger\n\nIs there any immediate danger in moving down?\n- No collision with walls or body.\n- The tail is at (3,5), which is not adjacent to the new head position (5,4), so no tail reward danger.\n\n### Alternative Consideration: Moving Right\n\nWhile moving right is safe, it doesn't help in getting closer to the food. The food is at (5,1), and moving right to (6,5) takes us away from the same column as the food. From (6,5), we'd have to move left or down to get back towards the food, which might not be optimal.\n\n### Decision\n\nGiven the options:\n- Right (R): Safe but not optimal for reaching food.\n- Up (U): Unsafe (collision with obstacle).\n- Down (D): Safe and moves towards food.\n\nThe best immediate action is to move down to get closer to the positive food at (5,1).\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{D}",

        "thinking": "Alright, let's tackle this Snake game scenario step by step. I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**Current Turn**: 19  \n**Grid Size**: Based on the wall coordinates, it seems like the grid is 8x8 (from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7).\n\n**Walls**:\n- Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (so the snake can't go beyond these).\n- Internal obstacle: (5, 6) — the snake can't move here.\n\n**Snake Positions**: \nHead at (5, 4), followed by body segments in order: (5,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (2,5).\n\n**Snake Head Direction**: Currently moving Down (D). This means the last move was Down, so the snake can't immediately reverse to Up (U) on the next move.\n\n**Food**:\n1. (5, 1) — value: +1, life span: 7\n2. (4, 3) — value: +1, life span: 10\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nGiven the current direction is Down (D), the possible next moves are:\n- Left (L)\n- Right (R)\n- Down (D) — but we need to check if this is safe.\n\nCannot move Up (U) because that's the opposite of the current direction (D).\n\n#### Checking Each Possible Move:\n\n1. **Move Down (D)**:\n   - Current head: (5, 4)\n   - Move Down: (5, 3)\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: y=0 is at the bottom, so y=3 is safe.\n     - Internal obstacles: (5,6) is not in our path.\n     - Body collision: Check if (5,3) is in the snake's body segments.\n       - Snake body: (5,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (2,5)\n       - (5,3) is not in the body — safe.\n   - Food at (5,3)? No, food is at (5,1) and (4,3).\n   - So moving Down is safe but doesn't eat food immediately.\n\n2. **Move Left (L)**:\n   - Current head: (5, 4)\n   - Move Left: (4, 4)\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: x=0 is left, x=4 is safe.\n     - Internal obstacles: (5,6) — not in path.\n     - Body collision: Is (4,4) in the body?\n       - Body segments don't include (4,4) — safe.\n   - Food at (4,4)? No, food is at (4,3) and (5,1).\n   - Moving Left is safe but doesn't eat food.\n\n3. **Move Right (R)**:\n   - Current head: (5, 4)\n   - Move Right: (6, 4)\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: x=7 is right, x=6 is safe.\n     - Internal obstacles: (5,6) — not in path.\n     - Body collision: Is (6,4) in the body? No — safe.\n   - Food at (6,4)? No.\n   - Moving Right is safe but doesn't eat food.\n\n### Evaluating Food Options\n\nNow, let's see where the food is and how we can reach them:\n\n1. **Food at (5,1)**:\n   - Current head: (5,4)\n   - To reach (5,1), need to move down three times: (5,3), (5,2), (5,1).\n   - But moving down now to (5,3) is safe, but next moves would need to be down again.\n   - Need to ensure that moving down multiple times doesn't lead to a dead end or collision.\n   - After moving to (5,3), next move could be down to (5,2), then (5,1).\n   - Check if (5,2) is safe after moving to (5,3):\n     - Snake body after moving to (5,3): tail moves forward, so new body is [(5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), ..., (2,5)] — (5,2) is not in this.\n     - Similarly, (5,1) would be safe next.\n   - However, we need to consider the \"Tail Reward Danger\":\n     - When eating at (5,1), the tail is at (2,5), which is not adjacent to (5,1), so no danger there.\n   - So path to (5,1): D -> D -> D.\n\n2. **Food at (4,3)**:\n   - Current head: (5,4)\n   - To reach (4,3), possible path: L to (4,4), then D to (4,3).\n   - After L to (4,4), next move D to (4,3):\n     - Check if (4,3) is safe:\n       - Body after L to (4,4): [(4,4), (5,4), (5,5), ..., (2,5)]\n       - (4,3) is not in the body — safe.\n     - Eating at (4,3):\n       - Tail is at (2,5), not adjacent to (4,3) — no Tail Reward Danger.\n   - So path to (4,3): L -> D.\n\n### Comparing the Two Food Options\n\n- **Path to (5,1)**: D -> D -> D (3 moves)\n  - Moves away from current position, might be safer in terms of not boxing in.\n  - But takes longer to reach.\n\n- **Path to (4,3)**: L -> D (2 moves)\n  - Quicker to reach.\n  - After L to (4,4), then D to (4,3), the snake's body will be around that area, but seems manageable.\n\nGiven that both foods are positive (+1), and both paths seem safe, the quicker path might be preferable to minimize risk over time.\n\n### Immediate Action at Turn 19\n\nAt turn 19, the first step towards (4,3) is to move Left (L).\n\n- Move L to (4,4).\n- Next turn (20), move D to (4,3) to eat the food.\n\nAlternatively, starting with D towards (5,1) is also safe but takes longer.\n\nGiven that both are safe, but moving towards (4,3) is quicker, I'd choose to start moving Left now.\n\n### Verifying No Immediate Dangers\n\nBefore finalizing, let's ensure that moving Left now doesn't create any immediate dangers:\n\n- After L to (4,4), the snake's body will be:\n  - Head: (4,4)\n  - Body: (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (4,6), ..., (2,5)\n- Possible next moves from (4,4):\n  - U: (4,5) — but (4,5) is in the body (next segment), so collision — cannot.\n  - D: (4,3) — safe, leads to food.\n  - L: (3,4) — need to check if in body; (3,4) is not in the body — safe.\n  - R: (5,4) — is in the body (next segment) — cannot.\nSo from (4,4), can go D or L. D leads to food, L is safe but away from food.\n\nThus, moving L now sets us up to move D next to eat the food at (4,3).\n\n### Checking for Better Immediate Options\n\nIs there a better immediate move than L? \n\n- D is safe but doesn't lead directly to food; it's the start of a longer path.\n- R is safe but away from both foods.\n- L is towards one food path.\n\nSo L seems optimal.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter considering all options, the best immediate action is to move Left (L) to position (4,4), setting up to move Down next to eat the food at (4,3).\n\n\\boxed{L}",

These are the edges of the grid.\n- Internal obstacle: (5, 6). This is a single cell that the snake cannot move into.\n\n**Snake Positions**: The snake's body is represented by a list of coordinates starting from the head:\n- Head: (4, 4)\n- Body: (5, 4), (5, 5), (4, 5), (4, 6), (3, 6), (2, 6), (1, 6), (1, 5)\n  \nSo, the snake's length is 9 (including the head).\n\n**Snake Head Direction**: Currently moving Left (L). This means the last move was to the left, so the previous position before (4,4) was to its right, which is (5,4).\n\n**Food Items**:\n1. (5, 1): value = +1, life_span = 6\n2. (4, 3): value = +1, life_span = 9\n\nBoth foods are positive (+1), so eating either would increase the snake's length by 1.\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However, there are constraints:\n\n1. **No instant reverse**: Since the current direction is Left (L), the snake cannot immediately move Right (R) in the next turn.\n   \n   So, possible moves: U, D, L\n\n2. **Wall and Obstacle Collision**: The snake cannot move into a cell occupied by a wall or an internal obstacle.\n\nLet's check each possible move:\n\n**Current head position**: (4, 4)\n\n- **Up (U)**: (x, y+1) = (4, 5)\n  - Check if (4,5) is occupied by the snake's body or is a wall.\n  - Snake body positions: (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5)\n    - (4,5) is part of the body (4th segment).\n    - Moving here would collide with the body → deadly.\n  \n- **Down (D)**: (x, y-1) = (4, 3)\n  - Check (4,3):\n    - Not in snake body: (4,3) is not in the list.\n    - Walls: y=0 is at y=0, so y=3 is not a wall.\n    - Internal obstacles: (5,6) is the only one, not (4,3).\n    - Also, there's food at (4,3) with value +1.\n    - So, moving Down is valid and would eat the food.\n\n- **Left (L)**: (x-1, y) = (3, 4)\n  - Check (3,4):\n    - Not in snake body: (3,4) is not in the list.\n    - Walls: x=0 is at x=0, x=3 is not a wall.\n    - Internal obstacles: not (3,4).\n    - No food at (3,4).\n    - So, moving Left is valid but doesn't eat food.\n\n**Right (R)**: Not possible due to no instant reverse rule (current direction is L).\n\n### Evaluating Moves\n\nNow, let's evaluate the valid moves: Down (D) and Left (L).\n\n**Down (D) to (4,3)**:\n- Eats positive food at (4,3):\n  - Reward: +1\n  - Length increases by 1: new length = 10\n  - New head: (4,3)\n  - New body: (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5)\n  - Need to check for \"Tail Reward Danger\":\n    - Tail is at (1,5).\n    - Is (1,5) adjacent to new head (4,3)?\n      - Adjacent means same x and y differs by 1 or same y and x differs by 1.\n      - (4,3) and (1,5): x diff = 3, y diff = 2 → not adjacent.\n    - Also, is there food at the tail (1,5)?\n      - Food is at (5,1) and (4,3). (1,5) has no food.\n    - So, no Tail Reward Danger here.\n  \n**Left (L) to (3,4)**:\n- Doesn't eat food.\n- New head: (3,4)\n- New body: (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5)\n- No immediate reward, but safe move.\n\n### Comparing D and L\n\n- **Down (D)**:\n  - Pros: Eats food (+1 score, length +1).\n  - Cons: Need to ensure no future collisions due to increased length.\n  \n- **Left (L)**:\n  - Pros: Safe, doesn't increase length.\n  - Cons: No immediate gain.\n\nGiven that both moves are safe in the immediate next step, but D gives a reward, it's generally better to take the food unless there's a risk.\n\n**Checking Tail Reward Danger for D**:\nAs calculated earlier, no danger from tail food since tail is at (1,5) with no food and not adjacent to new head (4,3).\n\n**Future Implications**:\nAfter moving D to (4,3):\n- Next moves from (4,3):\n  - Possible directions: U (back to (4,4) - but that's body, so deadly.\n  - D: (4,2) - not wall or body.\n  - L: (3,3) - not wall or body.\n  - R: (5,3) - not wall or body.\n  \nSo, after eating, there are safe moves available.\n\n### Decision\n\nBetween D and L, D is preferable because it yields a reward without immediate danger. L is safe but doesn't contribute to the score.\n\n### Verifying No Other Constraints\n\n- Food under body: Currently, no food is under the snake's body (food is at (5,1) and (4,3), neither is under the body).\n- Life span of foods:\n  - (5,1): life_span = 6 (from turn 20, so disappears at turn 26)\n  - (4,3): life_span = 9 (disappears at turn 29)\n  - Not immediately relevant for this turn's decision.\n\n### Final Choice\n\nThe best immediate action is to move Down to eat the positive food at (4,3).\n\n\\boxed{D}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action to take at turn \\( t_0 = 21 \\).\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**1. Grid Dimensions and Walls:**\n- The grid is 8x8 (from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7).\n- Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are all walls; cannot move into these cells.\n- Internal obstacle: (5, 6) is also a wall; cannot move here.\n\n**2. Snake Details:**\n- Current positions (head first): \n  - Head: (4, 3)\n  - Body: (4, 4), (5, 4), (5, 5), (4, 5), (4, 6), (3, 6), (2, 6), (1, 6), (1, 5)\n- Current direction: D (Down). This means the snake was moving downward to reach (4, 3) from (4, 4) in the previous move.\n\n**3. Food:**\n- Only one food item: (5, 1) with value = +1 (positive food), life span = 5 turns.\n\n### Possible Moves and Constraints\n\n**Movement Constraints:**\n- Cannot reverse direction immediately: Current direction is D, so cannot move U (Up) next.\n- Possible moves: D, L, R (since U is reverse and not allowed).\n\n**Checking Each Possible Move:**\n\n1. **Move Down (D):**\n   - Current head: (4, 3)\n   - Move D: (4, 2)\n   - Check if (4, 2) is valid:\n     - Not a wall: x=4 is not a border, y=2 is not a border, and (4, 2) is not an internal obstacle.\n     - Not part of the snake body: Check if (4, 2) is in the body segments.\n       - Body segments: from (4, 4) to (1, 5). (4, 2) is not in this list.\n     - Valid move.\n   - After moving, the tail (last segment) (1, 5) will move forward, so the new body will exclude (1, 5) and include (4, 2) at the head.\n   - No food at (4, 2), so no score change, length remains the same.\n\n2. **Move Left (L):**\n   - Current head: (4, 3)\n   - Move L: (3, 3)\n   - Check if (3, 3) is valid:\n     - Not a wall: x=3, y=3 are not borders, and (3, 3) is not an internal obstacle.\n     - Not in body: Checking body segments, (3, 6) is present but not (3, 3).\n     - Valid move.\n   - No food at (3, 3), so no score change.\n\n3. **Move Right (R):**\n   - Current head: (4, 3)\n   - Move R: (5, 3)\n   - Check if (5, 3) is valid:\n     - Not a wall: x=5 is not a border (x=7 is), y=3 is not a border, and (5, 3) is not an internal obstacle (internal obstacle is at (5, 6)).\n     - Not in body: Checking body segments, (5, 4) and (5, 5) are present but not (5, 3).\n     - Valid move.\n   - No food at (5, 3), so no score change.\n\n**Food Consideration:**\n- Current food is at (5, 1), which is two steps down from the head (from (4, 3) to (4, 2) to (4, 1), then right to (5, 1), but that's not direct.\n- To reach (5, 1), possible path: D to (4, 2), then R to (5, 2), then D to (5, 1).\n- But we're only deciding the immediate move, and none of the immediate moves lead directly to the food.\n\n**Avoiding Risks:**\n- Need to ensure that after moving, the snake doesn't trap itself or move into a position where future moves are limited.\n- Currently, moving D to (4, 2) seems safe; no immediate dangers.\n- Moving L to (3, 3) is also safe; opens up future options.\n- Moving R to (5, 3) is safe but moves towards the right side where there's an obstacle at (5, 6), but not immediately concerning.\n\n**Tail Reward Danger:**\n- Check if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food.\n- Tail is at (1, 5). Head is at (4, 3). Distance is |4-1| + |3-5| = 3 + 2 = 5, not adjacent (adjacent would be distance 1).\n- So no danger from tail reward in this case.\n\n### Deciding the Best Move\n\nAll three possible moves (D, L, R) are safe in terms of not hitting walls or body. None immediately reach the food. So, we can choose any, but ideally, we'd want to position the snake to potentially reach the food in future moves.\n\n- Moving D to (4, 2) doesn't help much in reaching (5, 1).\n- Moving L to (3, 3) might be okay but doesn't directly help.\n- Moving R to (5, 3) gets us closer to the x-coordinate of the food (5, 1). From (5, 3), next move could be D to (5, 2), then D to (5, 1) to eat the food.\n\nHowever, we must ensure that moving R doesn't lead to a dead end. Currently, the snake's body is mostly on the left and up, so moving right seems to open space.\n\n### Verifying Future Moves After R:\n\nAfter R to (5, 3):\n- Next turn, cannot move L (reverse), so possible: D, U, R.\n  - D to (5, 2): safe, then D to (5, 1) to eat food.\n  - U to (5, 4): but (5, 4) is part of the body, so invalid.\n  - R to (6, 3): safe, but not helpful for food.\nSo, after R, can go D to (5, 2), then D to (5, 1) to eat.\n\nAlternatively, after R to (5, 3), then D to (5, 2), then must go D to (5, 1) because:\n- Cannot go L (reverse), cannot go R (already at x=5, next is x=6), cannot go U (back to (5, 3), so only D is possible, which is fine.\n\n### Checking Other Moves for Future Food Access:\n\nIf we choose D to (4, 2):\n- Next moves: cannot go U, so D, L, R.\n  - D to (4, 1): then to reach (5, 1), need R to (5, 1), but need to check if (5,1) is under body:\n    - Current body after D to (4,2): [(4,2), (4,3), (4,4),..., (1,5)]; (5,1) is not under body, so can eat.\n    - But need to move from (4,1) to (5,1), which is R.\n    - Is (5,1) under body? Original body doesn't have (5,1), and after moving, tail moves away from (1,5), so no.\n    - So path: D to (4,2), D to (4,1), R to (5,1) to eat.\n\nThis is also a valid path to food, taking 3 moves.\n\nComparing both paths to food:\n- R then D then D: 3 moves to food.\n- D then D then R: 3 moves to food.\n\nBoth are equal in steps, but moving R first might be slightly better because it positions the snake more centrally, giving more options after eating the food.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter considering both options, moving **Right (R)** seems slightly better as it positions the snake more towards the center after eating the food, potentially offering more future movement options.\n\n**Action:**\n\n\\boxed{R}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding any risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The game is played on an 8x8 grid (since x and y range from 0 to 7).\n2. **Walls**:\n   - Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.\n   - Internal obstacle: (5,6).\n3. **Snake**:\n   - Positions (head first): [(5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6)].\n   - Current head direction: Right (R).\n4. **Food**:\n   - (5,1): value=1, life_span=4.\n   - (6,1): value=1, life_span=10.\n\n### Snake's Current Position and Possible Moves\n\nThe snake's head is at (5,3), moving right (R). From the head direction, the last move was to the right (from (4,3) to (5,3)).\n\n**Possible Moves** (cannot reverse direction immediately, so cannot go Left (L)):\n- Up (U): (5,4)\n- Down (D): (5,2)\n- Right (R): (6,3)\n\nNow, let's check each possible move for safety and potential rewards.\n\n### Checking Possible Moves\n\n1. **Move Up (U) to (5,4)**:\n   - Check if (5,4) is occupied by the snake's body:\n     - Snake body segments: (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), etc.\n     - (5,4) is the 4th segment in the body (counting from 0: head is 0, next is 1, etc.).\n     - Moving to (5,4) would mean the head collides with the body segment there → **Deadly collision**.\n   - **Conclusion**: Cannot move Up.\n\n2. **Move Down (D) to (5,2)**:\n   - Check walls: y=0 is a wall, but (5,2) is not on the wall.\n   - Check internal obstacles: (5,6) is not (5,2).\n   - Check snake body:\n     - Body segments: (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), etc. → (5,2) is not in the body.\n   - Check food:\n     - No food at (5,2).\n   - **Conclusion**: Safe move, but no immediate reward.\n\n3. **Move Right (R) to (6,3)**:\n   - Check walls: x=7 is a wall, (6,3) is not on the wall.\n   - Check internal obstacles: (5,6) is not (6,3).\n   - Check snake body:\n     - (6,3) is not in the body segments.\n   - Check food:\n     - No food at (6,3).\n   - **Conclusion**: Safe move, but no immediate reward.\n\n### Evaluating Food Options\n\nNow, let's look at the food positions to see if we can plan to reach them soon.\n\n1. **Food at (5,1)**:\n   - Current position: (5,3).\n   - To reach (5,1), need to move down twice:\n     - Next move: Down to (5,2).\n     - Then Down to (5,1).\n   - Life span: 4 turns left (including current turn).\n     - After this move (turn 22), life span decreases to 3.\n     - Then turn 23: move to (5,1) if possible.\n   - Value: +1.\n   - **Tail Reward Danger Check**:\n     - When head is at (5,1), check if tail is adjacent and has positive food.\n     - Current tail is at (1,6). After two moves:\n       - After first move Down to (5,2), tail moves to (4,3).\n       - After second move Down to (5,1), tail moves to (4,3) → (4,4).\n     - (5,1) is not adjacent to (4,4) (distance is sqrt((5-4)^2 + (1-4)^2) = sqrt(1 + 9) = sqrt(10) > 1).\n     - No danger from tail reward.\n   - **Conclusion**: Possible to reach in two moves, but need to ensure first move is safe.\n\n2. **Food at (6,1)**:\n   - Current position: (5,3).\n   - To reach (6,1), possible path:\n     - Right to (6,3), then Down to (6,2), then Down to (6,1).\n     - Or Down to (5,2), then Right to (6,2), then Down to (6,1).\n   - Life span: 10 turns left, so plenty of time.\n   - Value: +1.\n   - **Tail Reward Danger Check**:\n     - When head is at (6,1), tail would be at (4,4) or similar, not adjacent.\n     - No danger.\n   - **Conclusion**: Possible to reach in three moves, but not immediately helpful for next move.\n\n### Deciding the Best Immediate Action\n\nFrom the possible moves:\n- Up: Deadly collision.\n- Down: Safe, no reward, but can lead to (5,1) food next.\n- Right: Safe, no reward, can lead to (6,1) food later.\n\nBetween Down and Right:\n- Down allows us to potentially eat (5,1) next turn if we choose Down again.\n  - (5,1) has life span 4, so after this turn (22), it's 3, then next turn (23) it's 2 when we reach it.\n- Right is safe but doesn't lead to immediate food in the next step.\n\nGiven that (5,1) is closer and has a limited life span (will disappear after turn 25), it's better to prioritize eating it.\n\n### Verifying Safety After Down Move\n\nIf we move Down to (5,2):\n- Next turn, snake positions:\n  - Head moves to (5,2).\n  - Tail moves forward: remove (1,6), add new tail segment where head was (but since head moved, the body shifts).\n  - New body: [(5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6)].\n- Then next move can be Down to (5,1):\n  - Check if (5,1) is safe:\n    - Not a wall, not an obstacle.\n    - Not in the body: body is [(5,2), (5,3), ...], (5,1) is not there.\n    - Food is there, so eat it (+1 score, length increases by 1).\n    - No tail reward danger as previously checked.\n\n### Alternative Consideration\n\nIf we choose Right to (6,3):\n- Next turn, snake positions:\n  - Head at (6,3), body: [(6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6)].\n- Then possible moves from (6,3):\n  - Cannot go Left (reverse of Right).\n  - Up to (6,4): check if safe.\n    - (6,4) not in body, not wall → safe.\n  - Down to (6,2): safe.\n  - Right to (7,3): x=7 is wall → deadly.\n  - To reach (6,1), need two Down moves from (6,3).\n    - (6,3) → (6,2) → (6,1).\n    - But (6,1) has life span 10, so no rush.\n- Meanwhile, (5,1) will disappear soon.\n\nThus, choosing Right delays eating (5,1), which might disappear before we can get back to it.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe best immediate action is to move Down to (5,2), setting up to eat the positive food at (5,1) on the next turn before it disappears.\n\n\\boxed{D}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**Current Turn**: 23  \n**Walls**:\n- Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (so the grid is from (1,1) to (6,6) effectively, but wait, the borders are at x=0/x=7 and y=0/y=7, meaning the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), but with some internal obstacles.)\n- Internal Obstacle: (5,6)\n\n**Snake Positions**: \nHead at (5,2), followed by:\n- (5,3)\n- (4,3)\n- (4,4)\n- (5,4)\n- (5,5)\n- (4,5)\n- (4,6)\n- (3,6)\n- (2,6)\n\nSo the snake is quite long, with 10 segments.\n\n**Snake Head Direction**: Currently moving Down (D), which means the last move was from (5,1) to (5,2). \n\n**Food**:\n1. (5,1): value = 1, life_span = 3\n2. (6,1): value = 1, life_span = 9\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (5,2) moving Down (D), the possible next moves are:\n- Continue Down (D): (5,1)\n- Left (L): (4,2)\n- Right (R): (6,2)\n\nCannot move Up (U) because that would be the opposite of the current direction (D), which is not allowed (\"No instant reverse\").\n\n### Evaluating Possible Moves\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n#### 1. Move Down (D) to (5,1)\n- (5,1) is currently occupied by positive food (value=1, life_span=3).\n- To eat this food:\n  - The head moves to (5,1).\n  - The tail is at (2,6), which will move to (3,6) as the snake advances.\n  - The food is under the head's new position, and the body was not covering it before (since the head was at (5,2) and the body segments don't include (5,1)), so it can be eaten directly.\n- After eating:\n  - Length increases by 1.\n  - New tail will be the old tail, so the tail was at (2,6), now the new tail is at (3,6), and the head is at (5,1).\n  - Check for Tail Reward Danger: Is the head adjacent to the new tail? \n    - Head at (5,1), new tail at (3,6). Distance is |5-3| + |1-6| = 2 + 5 = 7, not adjacent (adjacent means distance 1). So no danger.\n- Collision check:\n  - Does (5,1) collide with any body part? The body segments are from (5,3) to (2,6). (5,1) is not in this list. No collision.\n  - Walls: (5,1) is within the grid (x=1..6, y=1..6). No wall at (5,1).\n- So moving Down is safe and gains +1.\n\n#### 2. Move Left (L) to (4,2)\n- (4,2): \n  - Is there food here? No, only food is at (5,1) and (6,1).\n  - Collision check:\n    - Body segments: (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6). (4,2) is not in this list. Safe.\n  - Walls: No wall at (4,2).\n  - This move is safe but doesn't gain any points.\n\n#### 3. Move Right (R) to (6,2)\n- (6,2):\n  - Food: No.\n  - Collision check: Not in body segments. Safe.\n  - Walls: x=6 is a border wall? Wait, border walls are x=0 and x=7, so x=6 is within bounds. y=2 is also within bounds. No internal wall at (6,2).\n  - Safe but no points.\n\n### Comparing Moves\n\n- Down (D): +1 point, safe.\n- Left (L): 0 points, safe.\n- Right (R): 0 points, safe.\n\nBetween these, moving Down is the best as it gains a point without any risk.\n\n### Checking for Potential Dangers\n\nIs there any hidden danger in moving Down?\n- The food at (5,1) has a life_span of 3. Current turn is 23, so it will disappear at turn 26. We're safe to eat it now.\n- No other immediate threats visible.\n\n### Verifying Tail Reward Danger Again\n\nJust to be thorough:\n- After moving Down to (5,1) and eating:\n  - New head: (5,1)\n  - New tail: (3,6) (since the tail was at (2,6), and the snake grows by 1, so the new tail is the second last segment, which was (3,6)).\n  - Adjacent to (5,1): (4,1), (6,1), (5,0), (5,2). (3,6) is not adjacent. Safe.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe best immediate action is to move Down to eat the positive food at (5,1), gaining +1 point safely.\n\n\\boxed{D}",

So, the snake cannot move outside these boundaries.\n   - **Internal Obstacle**: There's a wall at (5,6).\n3. **Snake**:\n   - **Positions**: The snake's body is represented by a list of coordinates starting from the head. The head is at (5,1), and the body follows down to the tail at (2,6).\n   - **Direction**: The snake is currently moving **Down (D)**.\n4. **Food**:\n   - There's one piece of food at (6,1) with a value of +1 and a lifespan of 8 turns.\n\n### Visualizing the Snake and Food\n\nIt's helpful to visualize the snake's position and the food:\n\n- **Head**: (5,1)\n- **Body**: (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6)\n- **Food**: (6,1)\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nSince the snake is moving **Down (D)**, the possible moves are:\n- **Continue Down (D)**: (5,0) → But y=0 is a wall → **Invalid**.\n- **Turn Left (L)**: (4,1) → Check if it's a wall or part of the body.\n- **Turn Right (R)**: (6,1) → Check if it's a wall or part of the body.\n\n**Note**: The snake cannot reverse direction (i.e., move Up) because it's currently moving Down.\n\n### Evaluating Left (L) Move: (4,1)\n\n1. **Wall Check**: (4,1) is not a border wall or an internal obstacle → **Valid**.\n2. **Body Collision Check**: \n   - The snake's body segments are from (5,2) to (2,6). \n   - (4,1) is not in the body → **Valid**.\n3. **Food Check**: No food at (4,1) → Just a move, no score change.\n\n### Evaluating Right (R) Move: (6,1)\n\n1. **Wall Check**: (6,1) is not a border wall → **Valid**.\n2. **Body Collision Check**: (6,1) is not in the body → **Valid**.\n3. **Food Check**: There's food at (6,1) → **Potential to eat**.\n   - **Value**: +1 → Positive food.\n   - **Tail Check**: The tail is at (2,6). The head is at (5,1), and the tail is at (2,6). The distance is significant → No immediate collision risk.\n   - **Special Case**: The food is not under the snake's body, so no need to worry about the body moving away.\n\n### Decision Making\n\n- **Option 1 (L)**: Safe move, but no immediate reward.\n- **Option 2 (R)**: Moves towards food, gains +1 score, and increases length.\n\n**Potential Risks**:\n- **Future Collisions**: After eating, the snake's length increases, but the tail moves forward. Need to ensure that the new tail position doesn't cause a collision.\n  - Current tail is at (2,6). After moving right and eating, the new tail will be at (5,2) because the last segment (2,6) is removed and a new segment is added at the head's new position.\n  - The head moves to (6,1), and the new tail is (5,2). The head is not adjacent to the new tail → **Safe**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe right move (R) is more beneficial as it allows the snake to eat the positive food without any immediate risk of collision.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{R}",

Food is at (2,5) → no overlap → no food eaten.\n\n### Considering the Food at (2,5)\n\nEven though the food is at (2,5), which is adjacent to the tail (2,6), the snake cannot reach it in this move. Also, the food is positive (value=1), but due to the \"Tail Reward Danger\" rule, if the head were to move onto (2,5) while adjacent to the tail (which it is now at (2,6)), it would cause a collision after growing, so it's dangerous to eat it in that scenario. However, currently, the head is at (6,1), far from the food, so this isn't an immediate concern.\n\n### Alternative Considerations\n\nIs there any other move possible? As established, only Up is valid. \n\n- If we could go Left, it would be to (5,1), but that's the first body segment → collision → invalid.\n- Down is invalid (wall).\n- Right is invalid (wall).\n\n### Verifying the Food's Accessibility\n\nThe food at (2,5) is not reachable in this move, and the snake's current path doesn't immediately threaten to collide with it dangerously. The life_span is 10, so it will disappear after 10 more turns (including this one), but that's not immediately relevant for this move.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe only safe and valid move is **Up (U)** to (6,2).\n\n\\boxed{U}",

So, the snake cannot move outside these bounds.\n   - There's one internal obstacle at (5, 6).\n\n2. **Snake Position and Direction**:\n   - Snake's head is at (6, 2), and the direction it's currently facing is \"U\" (Up).\n   - The body segments follow in order: [(6,1), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6)].\n   - Total length of the snake is 12 segments.\n\n3. **Food Information**:\n   - Only one food item is present at (2, 5) with a value of 1 (positive food) and a life span of 9 turns.\n\n### Visualizing the Snake and Food\n\nTo better understand the positions, let's visualize the grid (simplified):\n\n- Snake head at (6, 2) facing Up.\n- The tail is at (3, 6).\n- Food is at (2, 5).\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (6, 2) facing Up (\"U\"), the possible moves are:\n- **Up (U)**: (6, 3)\n- **Left (L)**: (5, 2)\n- **Right (R)**: (7, 2) — but x=7 is a wall, so invalid.\n  \nCannot move Down (\"D\") because that would be the opposite of the current direction (\"U\"), which is not allowed (no instant reverse).\n\nSo, valid immediate moves are:\n1. Up (U) to (6, 3)\n2. Left (L) to (5, 2)\n\n### Checking Move Validity\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move for collisions and food:\n\n1. **Move Up (U) to (6, 3)**:\n   - Check if (6, 3) is occupied by the snake's body:\n     - Snake body segments: (6,1), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6).\n     - (6,3) is not in this list, so no body collision.\n   - Check walls: (6,3) is not a wall.\n   - Food: No food at (6,3).\n   - Safe move, but doesn't eat food.\n\n2. **Move Left (L) to (5, 2)**:\n   - Check if (5, 2) is occupied by the snake's body:\n     - (5,2) is in the body segments (4th segment).\n     - However, (5,2) is the segment that the tail is moving away from. The tail is at (3,6), and the segment before it is (4,6), etc., so (5,2) is not the immediate tail segment that would move away.\n     - Actually, the tail is at (3,6), and the segment before it is (4,6), then (4,5), (5,5), etc. Tracing back, (5,2) is part of the body and not the tail's immediate previous position, so moving left would collide with the body.\n     - Wait, let's clarify: the snake's body is [(6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), ...]. Moving left from (6,2) to (5,2) would collide with the segment at (5,2), which is part of the body.\n     - Therefore, moving left would cause a collision with the body.\n\n   - Hence, moving Left is invalid due to body collision.\n\n### Re-evaluating Possible Moves\n\nFrom the above, moving Left causes a collision, and moving Right is invalid (wall). Moving Up is safe but doesn't eat food. \n\nWait, is there another direction possible? The current direction is Up (\"U\"), so the opposite is Down (\"D\"), which is not allowed. So only Left and Up are possible, with Left being invalid.\n\nThis seems to imply that the only valid move is Up, even though it doesn't eat food.\n\nBut let me double-check the snake's body to ensure that moving Left indeed collides:\n\nSnake body segments in order after head (6,2):\n1. (6,1)\n2. (5,1)\n3. (5,2)\n4. (5,3)\n5. (4,3)\n6. (4,4)\n7. (5,4)\n8. (5,5)\n9. (4,5)\n10. (4,6)\n11. (3,6)\n\nMoving Left from (6,2) to (5,2): (5,2) is the 4th segment (counting head as 0th), so it's part of the body and not the tail's immediate previous position. Hence, collision.\n\n### Considering Food\n\nThe food is at (2,5). Currently, the head is at (6,2). To reach (2,5), the snake would need to move left and up. But currently, the only safe move is Up to (6,3), which doesn't help in reaching the food directly.\n\nGiven that, the immediate priority is to avoid collision, so moving Up is the only safe option.\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nThe rule mentions \"Tail Reward Danger\": if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nIn this case:\n- Tail is at (3,6).\n- Adjacent cells to tail: (2,6), (4,6), (3,5), (3,7) — but y=7 is a wall, so (3,7) is invalid.\n- Head is at (6,2), which is not adjacent to (3,6), so this rule doesn't apply here.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe only safe move is Up (\"U\"), even though it doesn't lead to eating food immediately. \n\n\\boxed{U}",

So, the snake cannot move outside these boundaries.\n   - **Internal Obstacle**: There's one internal wall at (5,6).\n3. **Snake**:\n   - **Positions**: The snake's head is at (6,4), followed by body segments at (6,3), (6,2), ..., up to the tail at (4,5).\n   - **Length**: Counting the positions, the snake has 12 segments.\n   - **Current Direction**: The head is moving \"U\" (Up, which is increasing y-coordinate).\n4. **Food**:\n   - **Positive Food at (2,5)**: Value = +1, Life Span = 7.\n   - **Positive Food at (6,4)**: Value = +1, Life Span = 10.\n\n### Analyzing Possible Moves\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However, since the current direction is Up, the snake cannot instantly reverse to Down (D) on the next move. So, possible immediate actions are U, L, R.\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n#### 1. Move Up (U) to (6,5)\n- **Check for Collisions**:\n  - **Walls**: y=7 is the upper wall, so (6,5) is within bounds.\n  - **Body**: The snake's body segments are at (6,3), (6,2), etc. (6,5) is not currently occupied by the body.\n  - **Internal Obstacle**: (5,6) is the only internal wall; (6,5) is not a wall.\n- **Food Check**:\n  - There's food at (6,4), but the head is moving away from it to (6,5), so it's not being eaten now.\n  - No food at (6,5).\n- **Outcome**: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n#### 2. Move Left (L) to (5,4)\n- **Check for Collisions**:\n  - **Walls**: x=0 is the left wall; (5,4) is within bounds.\n  - **Body**: The snake's body includes (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5). (5,4) is occupied by the body.\n     - However, (5,4) is the 10th segment (counting from head at 0). The tail is at (4,5), which will move forward when the head moves, so (5,4) is about to be vacated.\n     - But the head moving into (5,4) would collide with the body segment there unless that segment is the tail. Here, the tail is at (4,5), so (5,4) is not the tail. Hence, this is a body collision.\n- **Outcome**: Collision with body, deadly. Invalid move.\n\n#### 3. Move Right (R) to (7,4)\n- **Check for Collisions**:\n  - **Walls**: x=7 is the right wall; moving to (7,4) is a wall collision.\n- **Outcome**: Wall collision, deadly. Invalid move.\n\n### Re-evaluating Possible Moves\n\nFrom the above, moving Up is the only viable immediate action since Left and Right lead to collisions. However, let's double-check if there's any overlooked aspect:\n\n- **Food at (6,4)**: Currently under the head. According to rules:\n  - To eat food under the body, the body must move away, and then the head must move onto it.\n  - Here, the head is on (6,4) with food. If we move Up to (6,5), the head moves away, but the next segment (6,3) doesn't occupy (6,4), so the food remains at (6,4).\n  - To eat it, we'd need to move away and then back, but that's not possible in one move.\n  - Also, the food at (6,4) is under the head, but the head can't eat it directly unless the body moves away first, which isn't happening here.\n\n- **Tail Reward Danger**: The tail is at (4,5). Is the head adjacent to the tail?\n  - Head at (6,4), tail at (4,5). Distance is |6-4| + |4-5| = 2 + 1 = 3, not adjacent (adjacent would be distance 1).\n  - So no danger from tail reward.\n\n### Checking for Other Food\n\nThe other food is at (2,5), which is quite far from the head at (6,4). It's not immediately reachable, and moving towards it isn't feasible in one move without risking collisions.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe only safe move is **Up (U)** to (6,5). Moving Left or Right leads to immediate collisions, and staying in place isn't an option (must move). The food at (6,4) cannot be eaten in this move based on the rules provided.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{U}",

The possible moves are Up (U), Left (L), or Right (R). Moving Down (D) is not allowed because it's the opposite of the current direction (U).\n\n#### Checking Each Possible Move:\n\n1. **Move Up (U)**: New head position would be (6, 6).\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: y=7 is a wall, but (6,6) is not a wall.\n     - Body: Check if (6,6) is in the snake's body segments.\n       - Current body segments: (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5).\n       - (6,6) is not in the body, so no collision.\n   - Check for food:\n     - No food at (6,6).\n   - Check if moving to (6,6) is safe:\n     - Next move considerations: After moving up, the tail moves forward, so the body segments will shift.\n     - Need to ensure that future moves are possible without immediate death.\n\n2. **Move Left (L)**: New head position would be (5, 5).\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: x=0 is a wall, but (5,5) is not a wall.\n     - Body: Check if (5,5) is in the snake's body segments.\n       - (5,5) is the last segment of the snake's body (tail).\n       - Normally, moving into the tail is safe because the tail moves forward, but we need to check for \"Tail Reward Danger\":\n         - If there's positive food at the tail and the head is adjacent to the tail, eating it kills the snake.\n         - Here, the tail is at (5,5), and the head is at (6,5), so they are adjacent (left move would make the head go to (5,5)).\n         - Is there positive food at (5,5)? Looking at food positions:\n           - (2,5) and (6,4) are the food positions, so no food at (5,5).\n         - Therefore, no Tail Reward Danger, and moving left is safe.\n   - Check for food:\n     - No food at (5,5).\n   - After moving left, the tail moves forward, so the body segments will be [(5,5), (6,5), (6,4), ...].\n\n3. **Move Right (R)**: New head position would be (7, 5).\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: x=7 is a wall, so (7,5) is a wall collision → deadly.\n   - Therefore, cannot move right.\n\n### Evaluating Food Options\n\nNow, let's look at the food positions and their attributes:\n\n1. **(2, 5)**: value = 6, life_span = 1.\n   - Distance from head (6,5): |6-2| + |5-5| = 4.\n   - It's quite far, and with life_span = 1, it will disappear next turn, so we can't reach it in time.\n2. **(6, 4)**: value = 9, life_span = 1.\n   - Distance from head (6,5): |6-6| + |5-4| = 1.\n   - It's adjacent to the head (directly below, at (6,4)).\n   - Current direction is Up, so to reach (6,4), we'd need to move Down, but Down is opposite to Up, which is not allowed.\n   - Therefore, cannot eat this food this turn.\n\n### Determining the Best Move\n\nGiven that we cannot reach any food this turn (one is too far and will disappear, the other is in an opposite direction), our priority is to stay alive and position ourselves for future opportunities.\n\nFrom the possible moves:\n- **Up (U)**: Safe, moves to (6,6).\n  - Next turn, possible moves from (6,6) with direction U:\n    - U: (6,7) → y=7 is wall → deadly.\n    - L: (5,6) → check if it's safe:\n      - (5,6) is an internal obstacle → deadly.\n    - R: (7,6) → x=7 is wall → deadly.\n    - So moving Up now would lead to certain death next turn.\n  \n- **Left (L)**: Safe, moves to (5,5).\n  - Next turn, direction would be L.\n    - Possible moves from (5,5) with direction L:\n      - U: (5,6) → obstacle → deadly.\n      - L: (4,5) → check:\n        - Not a wall or body (current body after moving left would be [(5,5), (6,5), (6,4), ...], so (4,5) is safe.\n      - D: (5,4) → check:\n        - (5,4) is in the body (after move left, body is [(5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), ..., (5,4) is in the body) → deadly.\n    - So only L is safe next turn if we move L now.\n  \n- **Right (R)**: Wall collision → deadly.\n\nBetween Up and Left:\n- Up leads to certain death next turn.\n- Left allows us to continue moving left next turn, keeping options open.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Food After Left Move\n\nIf we move left to (5,5), the food at (6,4) will be under the body at (6,4). To eat it:\n- The body must move away from (6,4), and then the head must move onto it.\n- After moving left, the body will be [(5,5), (6,5), (6,4), ...], so (6,4) is still occupied.\n- Next turn, if we move left again to (4,5), the body becomes [(4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), ...], so (6,4) is still occupied.\n- It seems we cannot free (6,4) soon enough before its life_span expires (it's 1, so disappears next turn).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe only safe move that doesn't lead to immediate death is **Left (L)**. Moving Up leads to certain death next turn, and Right is a wall collision. Left allows us to continue moving left next turn, keeping the snake alive longer.\n\n\\boxed{L}",

        "thinking": "Alright, let's tackle this Snake game scenario step by step. I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The grid is 8x8 (from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7).\n2. **Walls**:\n   - Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (can't move beyond these).\n   - Internal obstacle: (5, 6) — can't move here.\n3. **Snake**:\n   - Positions (head first): [(4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4)]\n   - Current direction: Left (L).\n4. **Food**:\n   - (2, 5): value=1, life_span=4\n   - (6, 4): value=1, life_span=7\n   - (6, 5): value=1, life_span=10\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (4,5), moving Left (L) was the last move. The possible moves are:\n- Up (U): (4,6)\n- Down (D): (4,4)\n- Left (L): (3,5)\n- Right (R): (5,5) — but this is the first body segment, so moving right would cause a collision (unless it's the tail and the tail moves away, but here it's not the tail).\n\nBut we cannot move in the opposite direction of the current direction unless it's allowed. The current direction is Left, so the opposite is Right. Typically, in Snake, you can't reverse direction instantly, so Right is invalid here.\n\nSo valid moves: U, D, L.\n\n### Checking Each Move\n\n1. **Move Up (U)**: (4,6)\n   - Check walls: y=6 is not a wall (border is y=7), and no internal obstacle at (4,6).\n   - Check body collision: Is (4,6) in the snake's body? Let's see the body segments:\n     - (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4)\n     - (4,6) is not in this list — safe.\n   - Food at (4,6)? No food listed there — no score change.\n   - After moving, the tail (last segment (4,4)) will move forward, so the new tail is (5,1) moves to (5,2), etc., but the head is at (4,6), body starts at (4,5), etc.\n   - No immediate danger.\n\n2. **Move Down (D)**: (4,4)\n   - Check walls: y=4 is not a wall.\n   - Check body collision: Is (4,4) in the body? Yes, it's the last segment in the list — the tail.\n     - Normally, moving into the tail is safe because the tail moves away, but we have to check for \"Tail Reward Danger\":\n       - If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake.\n       - Here, tail is at (4,4), head is at (4,5), so they are adjacent (same x, y differs by 1).\n       - Is there food at (4,4)? Looking at food positions: (2,5), (6,4), (6,5) — no food at (4,4).\n       - So no Tail Reward Danger here.\n     - Therefore, moving into the tail is safe.\n   - Food at (4,4)? No — no score change.\n   - After moving, head is at (4,4), body starts at (4,5), etc., tail moves away from (4,4).\n\n3. **Move Left (L)**: (3,5)\n   - Check walls: x=3 is not a wall (border is x=0).\n   - Check body collision: Is (3,5) in the body? No — safe.\n   - Food at (3,5)? No — no score change.\n   - After moving, head is at (3,5), body starts at (4,5), etc.\n\n### Evaluating Food\n\nNow, let's see if any food is reachable or if moving towards food is beneficial.\n\nCurrent food:\n1. (2,5): value=1, life=4\n   - Distance from head (4,5): need to move left twice to reach (2,5).\n   - Life span is 4, so it will disappear after 4 more turns (including current turn if we don't eat it now).\n   - Currently, moving left once gets us to (3,5), next move could be left to (2,5) to eat it next turn.\n2. (6,4): value=1, life=7\n   - From head (4,5), need to go right then down, or down then right, but right is invalid (opposite of current left).\n   - To reach (6,4), path could be down to (4,4), then right to (5,4), then right to (6,4), but that's multiple moves.\n   - Life is 7, so plenty of time.\n3. (6,5): value=1, life=10\n   - Adjacent to head? Head is at (4,5), (6,5) is two units right — not adjacent.\n   - To reach, need to go right twice, but right is invalid now.\n\nSo the most immediately reachable positive food is (2,5), which requires moving left now to (3,5), then left next turn to (2,5) to eat it.\n\n### Checking for Negative Food\n\nThe problem mentions negative food, but in the current state, all food has value=1 (positive). So no negative food to avoid.\n\n### Avoiding Dead Ends\n\nWe should also ensure that moving left doesn't trap us. After moving left to (3,5), possible next moves:\n- From (3,5), direction is L (last move was L), so can't move R.\n- Possible: U (3,6), D (3,4), L (2,5).\n- (3,6): not wall, not body — safe.\n- (3,4): not wall, not body — safe.\n- (2,5): not wall, not body — safe (and has food).\nSo no immediate trap.\n\n### Comparing Moves\n\n- Up (U): (4,6)\n  - Safe, no immediate benefit, moves away from food.\n- Down (D): (4,4)\n  - Safe, moves towards the body's center, not towards food.\n- Left (L): (3,5)\n  - Safe, moves towards food (2,5) which can be eaten next turn.\n\nBest move seems to be Left, to position ourselves to eat the food at (2,5) next turn.\n\n### Verifying Tail Reward Danger\n\nEarlier, we saw that moving down to (4,4) is safe because there's no food there. But let's confirm:\n- Tail is at (4,4), head is at (4,5), adjacent vertically.\n- Moving down to (4,4) would have head at (4,4), body starts at (4,5), etc., tail was at (4,4) but moves away to (5,1) -> (5,2), etc.\n- No food at (4,4), so no danger.\nBut moving left is more beneficial for eating food.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe best immediate action is to move Left to position the snake to eat the positive food at (2,5) in the next turn.\n\n\\boxed{L}",

Grid Layout:**\n- The grid is 8x8 (since x and y range from 0 to 7).\n- **Walls:**\n  - Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.\n  - Internal obstacle: (5, 6).\n\n**2. Snake:**\n- Positions (head first): [(3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3)].\n- Current head direction: Left (L).\n\n**3. Food:**\n- (2,5): value=1, life_span=3.\n- (6,4): value=1, life_span=6.\n- (6,5): value=1, life_span=9.\n\n### Visualizing the Snake and Food\n\nLet's visualize the snake's body to understand its shape and possible movements.\n\n- Head at (3,5), moving left (from (4,5) to (3,5)).\n- Body segments follow the head's path, forming a long snake that's currently making a downward turn after moving left.\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (3,5) moving left, the possible next moves are:\n- **Left (L):** (2,5) - but we're already moving left, so this would continue left.\n- **Up (U):** (3,6) - but y=7 is a wall, so y=6 is safe unless it's a wall or snake body.\n- **Down (D):** (3,4) - y=0 is a wall, so y=4 is safe unless it's a wall or snake body.\n\nWe cannot move right (R) because that would be an instant reverse (from left to right), which is not allowed.\n\n### Checking Each Possible Move\n\n**1. Move Left (L) to (2,5):**\n- Check if (2,5) is valid:\n  - Not a wall: x=2 is not a border wall, and no internal wall at (2,5).\n  - Not part of the snake's body: Looking at snake positions, (2,5) is not listed.\n  - Food at (2,5): value=1 (positive), life_span=3.\n    - Eating this food would increase length by 1 and score by 1.\n    - Check for Tail Reward Danger:\n      - Tail is at (4,3). Adjacent cells to head (3,5) are:\n        - (2,5), (4,5), (3,4), (3,6).\n      - Tail is at (4,3), not adjacent to head, so no danger.\n- Conclusion: Safe to eat positive food at (2,5).\n\n**2. Move Up (U) to (3,6):**\n- Check if (3,6) is valid:\n  - Not a wall: y=6 is not a border wall, and no internal wall at (3,6).\n  - Not part of the snake's body: (3,6) is not in the snake positions.\n  - No food at (3,6).\n- This move is safe but doesn't gain any points.\n\n**3. Move Down (D) to (3,4):**\n- Check if (3,4) is valid:\n  - Not a wall: y=4 is not a border wall, and no internal wall at (3,4).\n  - Not part of the snake's body: (3,4) is not in the snake positions.\n  - No food at (3,4).\n- This move is safe but doesn't gain any points.\n\n### Evaluating Food Options\n\n- (2,5): Immediate positive food, safe to eat.\n- (6,4): On the snake's body at (6,4), which is part of the body. To eat this, the body must move away first, which isn't immediate.\n- (6,5): Also on the snake's body at (6,5), same issue.\n\nSo, the only immediately accessible food is at (2,5).\n\n### Checking for Immediate Dangers\n\nAfter moving left to (2,5), the new head is at (2,5), and the tail moves forward, so the segment at (4,3) is removed, and a new segment is added at (2,5) (since we ate food, length increases by 1).\n\nNext possible moves from (2,5):\n- Left: (1,5) - need to check if that's safe in future turns.\nBut for now, no immediate collision.\n\n### Comparing Moves\n\n- Left (L): Gain +1 score, increase length, safe.\n- Up (U) or Down (D): No gain, but safe.\n  \nBest immediate action is to go for the positive food at (2,5).\n\n### Verifying No Better Options\n\nIs there a better sequence where moving away now could lead to more food later?\n- The other foods are on the body and not immediately accessible.\n- Their life spans are 6 and 9, so they'll be around for a while.\n- Moving left now doesn't preclude accessing them later.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe optimal immediate action is to move left to eat the positive food at (2,5).\n\n\\boxed{L}",

The body must move away from the food cell.\n2. Then, the head must move onto the food cell.\n\nGiven the current position, it's impossible to eat either food this turn because:\n- The snake's head is at (2,5), far from (6,4) and (6,5).\n- Even if we move towards them, we can't reach them in one move, and they'll disappear next turn.\n\nThus, the foods are not reachable this turn and can be ignored for immediate action.\n\n### Avoiding Collisions\n\nWe must ensure that the next move doesn't lead to a collision:\n- Moving U to (2,6): safe.\n- Moving D to (2,4): safe.\n- Moving L to (1,5): safe.\n\n### Choosing the Best Move\n\nSince foods are not reachable, the priority is to avoid getting trapped and maximize future options.

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action to take at Turn 34.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**Grid Dimensions and Walls:**\n- The grid is 8x8 (from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7).\n- Border walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.\n- There's one internal obstacle at (5, 6).\n\n**Snake:**\n- Positions (head first): [(2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3)]\n- Current head direction: Down (D).\n\n**Food Items:**\n1. (6,4): value=4, life_span=1\n2. (6,5): value=7, life_span=1\n3. (5,4): value=10, life_span=1\n\n### Visualizing the Snake and Food\n\nLet me try to visualize the snake's position to better understand the possible moves.\n\n- Head is at (2,4), direction is Down (D), meaning it was moving downward in the previous move.\n- The next segment is at (2,5), which is directly above the head. This implies the snake was moving upward before the last move, but now it's moving downward, which seems like a reversal. Wait, that might not be possible because of the \"no instant reverse\" rule. Maybe I'm misinterpreting the direction.\n\nWait, the \"Snake Head Direction\" is D (Down), meaning the head is currently facing downward. The previous move must have been downward unless it just changed direction. Given the positions:\n- Head: (2,4)\n- Next: (2,5) — this is above the head, so if the head moved down to (2,4), it must have come from (2,5). So the previous position was (2,5), moved down to (2,4). So the direction is correctly D.\n\nBut then the next segment is (2,5), which is where the head was, then (3,5), etc. So the snake's body is making some turns.\n\n### Possible Moves from Current Head Position (2,4), Direction D\n\nFrom direction D, possible moves are:\n- Continue Down (D): (2,3)\n- Left (L): (1,4)\n- Right (R): (3,4)\n\nCannot move Up (U) because that's the opposite of current direction D.\n\nNow, let's check each possible move for safety and potential to eat food.\n\n#### 1. Move Down (D) to (2,3)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Body: The snake's body segments are all above or to the right of (2,4), except the tail is at (5,3). (2,3) is not in the body list.\n  - Walls: y=0 is at y=0, so (2,3) is within bounds.\n  - Obstacles: (5,6) is not at (2,3).\n- Food: No food at (2,3).\n- Safe move, but no immediate reward.\n\n#### 2. Move Left (L) to (1,4)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Body: (1,4) is not in the body list.\n  - Walls: x=0 is at x=0, so (1,4) is within bounds (x=1 is not a wall).\n  - Obstacles: (5,6) is not at (1,4).\n- Food: No food at (1,4).\n- Safe move, but no immediate reward.\n\n#### 3. Move Right (R) to (3,4)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Body: (3,4) is not in the body list.\n  - Walls: x=7 is at x=7, so (3,4) is within bounds.\n  - Obstacles: (5,6) is not at (3,4).\n- Food: No food at (3,4).\n- Safe move, but no immediate reward.\n\n### Checking Food Positions\n\nNow, let's look at the food items to see if any are adjacent to the head and can be eaten safely.\n\n1. (6,4): value=4, life_span=1\n   - Distance from head (2,4): |6-2| + |4-4| = 4. Not adjacent.\n2. (6,5): value=7, life_span=1\n   - Distance: |6-2| + |5-4| = 4 + 1 = 5. Not adjacent.\n3. (5,4): value=10, life_span=1\n   - Distance: |5-2| + |4-4| = 3. Not adjacent.\n\nNone of the food items are adjacent to the head right now, so we can't eat any food this turn.\n\n### Considering Future Moves\n\nSince no food is immediately accessible, we should choose a move that keeps the snake safe and possibly positions it to reach food in future turns.\n\nLooking at the food:\n- (5,4) is to the right and slightly down from the head. Moving right (R) to (3,4) would be a step towards it.\n- (6,4) and (6,5) are further right and up/down.\n\nMoving Right (R) seems like a reasonable choice to eventually reach (5,4), which has the highest value (10).\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nThe rule mentions that if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake. Currently, the tail is at (5,3). The head is at (2,4), distance is |5-2| + |3-4| = 3 + 1 = 4. Not adjacent, so no danger here.\n\n### Life Span of Food\n\nAll foods have life_span=1, meaning they will disappear after this turn.

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State\n\nFirst, let's break down the current state to understand the position and constraints of the snake, the walls, and the available food.\n\n#### 1. **Grid Dimensions and Walls**\n- The grid is bounded by borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. This means the playable area is from x=1 to x=6 and y=1 to y=6 (assuming typical zero-based indexing where x=7 and y=7 are out of bounds).\n- There's an internal obstacle at (5, 6), meaning the snake cannot move to this cell.\n\n#### 2. **Snake Position and Direction**\n- **Snake Positions**: The snake's body is represented by a list of coordinates starting from the head to the tail. Here's the sequence:\n  - Head: (3, 4)\n  - Next segments: (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 5), (4, 5), (5, 5), (6, 5), (6, 4), (6, 3), (6, 2), (6, 1), (5, 1), (5, 2)\n- **Current Direction**: The snake's head is moving **Right (R)**, meaning its last move was towards increasing x-coordinate.\n\n#### 3. **Food Items**\nThere are three food items with their positions, remaining life spans, and values:\n1. (6, 4): value = 1, life_span = 3\n   - This is at the same position as one of the snake's body segments (6, 4).\n2. (6, 5): value = 1, life_span = 6\n   - This is at the same position as another body segment (6, 5).\n3. (5, 4): value = 1, life_span = 9\n   - This is at (5, 4), which is currently unoccupied by the snake.\n\n### Movement Constraints\n\n- **No Instant Reverse**: Since the last move was Right (R), the next move cannot be Left (L).\n- **Possible Moves**: Up (U), Down (D), Right (R)\n  \n  - **Up (U)**: (x, y+1) → (3, 5)\n  - **Down (D)**: (x, y-1) → (3, 3)\n  - **Right (R)**: (x+1, y) → (4, 4)\n\n### Evaluating Possible Moves\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move for safety (no collisions) and potential to eat food.\n\n#### 1. Move Right (R) to (4, 4)\n- **Collision Check**:\n  - (4, 4) is not in the snake's body segments.\n  - Not a wall (borders are at x=0,7; y=0,7; internal obstacle at (5,6) doesn't affect this).\n  - Safe move.\n- **Food Check**:\n  - No food at (4, 4).\n  - This move doesn't eat any food but is safe.\n\n#### 2. Move Up (U) to (3, 5)\n- **Collision Check**:\n  - (3, 5) is part of the snake's body (4th segment).\n  - Moving here would collide with the body → deadly.\n  - **Not safe**.\n\n#### 3. Move Down (D) to (3, 3)\n- **Collision Check**:\n  - (3, 3) is not in the snake's body.\n  - Not a wall.\n  - Safe move.\n- **Food Check**:\n  - No food at (3, 3).\n  - Safe but no immediate benefit.\n\n### Considering Food Consumption\n\nNow, let's see if any food can be eaten in the next moves, considering their positions and the snake's body.\n\n1. **Food at (6, 4)**:\n   - Currently under the snake's body at (6, 4).\n   - To eat this:\n     - The body must move away from (6, 4), and then the head must move onto it.\n     - Currently, the head is at (3, 4), moving towards (6, 4) would require several right moves.\n     - Not immediately accessible in the next move.\n\n2. **Food at (6, 5)**:\n   - Under the body at (6, 5).\n   - Similar to above, not immediately accessible.\n\n3. **Food at (5, 4)**:\n   - Accessible if the snake moves towards it.\n   - Current head at (3, 4), so path is:\n     - Right to (4, 4), then right to (5, 4).\n   - Next move could be Right to (4, 4), then Right to (5, 4) to eat the food.\n   - However, need to ensure that moving to (5, 4) is safe:\n     - After moving to (4, 4), the tail will have moved from (5, 2) to (?, ?). Need to see how the body moves.\n     - The snake's length is 13 (number of segments). Eating positive food increases length by 1.\n     - After moving to (4, 4), the tail (last segment) (5, 2) will be removed, and a new segment will be added at the head's new position.\n     - Then next move to (5, 4):\n       - Check if (5, 4) is safe: not in the new body segments.\n       - Not a wall.\n       - Safe to move there to eat the food.\n\nHowever, the current task is to decide the immediate action at turn t_0=35, not plan multiple moves ahead. So, the immediate safe moves are Right to (4, 4) or Down to (3, 3).\n\nBetween these, moving Right seems better because:\n- It moves the snake towards the food at (5, 4), setting up for a potential eat in the next move.\n- Moving Down doesn't contribute to approaching any food.\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nOne special rule is the \"Tail Reward Danger\":\n- If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n  \nIn the current state:\n- Tail is at (5, 2).\n- Head is at (3, 4). Distance is |3-5| + |4-2| = 2 + 2 = 4 (not adjacent; adjacent means distance of 1).\n- So, no immediate danger from this rule.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nGiven the above analysis, the safest and most beneficial immediate move is to continue moving **Right (R)** to (4, 4), setting up to potentially eat the food at (5, 4) in the next move.\n\n\\boxed{R}",

(5,4): value=8, life_span=1\n   - This is at (5,4), which is adjacent to the head (4,4) to the right (since head is at (4,4), moving R would go to (5,4)).\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nThe snake is currently moving Right (R). The possible moves are:\n- **Up (U)**: (x, y+1) → (4,5)\n- **Down (D)**: (x, y-1) → (4,3)\n- **Left (L)**: (x-1,y) → (3,4)\n- **Right (R)**: (x+1,y) → (5,4)\n\nBut we cannot instantly reverse the direction. Current direction is R, so we cannot move Left (L) next. So possible moves: U, D, R.\n\n### Evaluating Possible Moves\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n1. **Right (R) to (5,4)**:\n   - (5,4) has food with value=8, life_span=1.\n   - Is (5,4) occupied by the snake's body? Let's check the body segments:\n     - Snake body: (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1)\n     - (5,4) is not in the body segments, so it's safe to move there.\n   - Eating this food: +8 to score, length increases by 1.\n   - After moving, the new head is at (5,4), and the tail moves forward, so the segment at (5,1) is removed.\n   - Check for Tail Reward Danger: Is the head adjacent to the tail after this move?\n     - Current tail is at (5,1). After moving, new tail is at (3,4) (since the last segment (5,1) is removed, and the segment before that is (6,1), but actually, the tail is the last segment in the list after moving, which would be (6,1) if we remove (5,1). Wait, let's see:\n     - Original body: [(4,4), (3,4), ..., (5,1)]\n     - After moving R: new head at (5,4), add to front, remove last segment (5,1).\n     - New body: [(5,4), (4,4), (3,4), ..., (6,1)]\n     - Tail is at (6,1). Is (5,4) adjacent to (6,1)? (5,4) and (6,1): no, they are not adjacent (distance is more than 1).\n   - So no Tail Reward Danger.\n   - Also, no wall or obstacle at (5,4).\n   - This seems like a very good move: high-value food, no immediate danger.\n\n2. **Up (U) to (4,5)**:\n   - (4,5) is part of the snake's body (6th segment from head).\n   - Moving into your own body is deadly (unless it's the tail, but here it's not the tail).\n   - So this is a collision, which is deadly. Avoid.\n\n3. **Down (D) to (4,3)**:\n   - (4,3): is this occupied by snake or wall?\n     - Snake body: check all segments — no (4,3).\n     - Walls: border is y=0, so y=3 is not a wall.\n     - Internal obstacle: (5,6) — not here.\n   - Safe to move here.\n   - Is there food here? No, the foods are at (6,4), (6,5), (5,4).\n   - So this is a safe move but doesn't gain any points.\n   - Not as good as moving Right to eat the +8 food.\n\n### Checking Food at (6,4) and (6,5)\n\nThese foods are under the snake's body. To eat them:\n1. The body must move away (i.e., the segment at that position moves).\n2. Then the head can move onto it.\n\nCurrently:\n- (6,4): food value=2, under body segment (6,4).\n- (6,5): food value=5, under body segment (6,5).\n\nTo eat (6,4):\n- Need the segment at (6,4) to move away, then head moves to (6,4).\n- But the segment at (6,4) is the 9th segment, so it would take many moves for it to move away, and by then the food's life_span=1 will expire (next turn).\n\nSimilarly for (6,5).\n\nSo it's not feasible to eat these in the next move.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe best immediate action is to move **Right (R)** to (5,4) to eat the high-value food (+8) safely, without any immediate dangers.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{R}",

Current direction is R, so we cannot move Left (L) next. So possible moves: U, D, R.\n\n### Evaluating Each Possible Move\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move for safety and potential to eat food.\n\n#### 1. Move Right (R) to (6,4)\n- New head position: (6,4)\n- Check if (6,4) is safe:\n  - Is it a wall? No, x=6 is within 0-7, y=4 is within 0-7, and (6,4) is not an internal obstacle.\n  - Is it part of the snake's body? Looking at snake positions: (6,4) is the 10th segment (counting from head as 1). So it's the 10th segment from head, meaning it's the tail's segment (since the snake has 14 segments, and the tail is the last one). \n    - Wait, the snake's length is 14 segments: [(5,4), ..., (5,1)] - that's 14 segments.\n    - The tail is (5,1). So (6,4) is not the tail; it's somewhere in the middle.\n    - Actually, counting: (5,4)=head, (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1)=tail. So (6,4) is the 10th segment, which is part of the body.\n  - Moving to (6,4) would collide with the body at (6,4). So this is deadly. Cannot move R.\n\n#### 2. Move Up (U) to (5,5)\n- New head position: (5,5)\n- Check safety:\n  - Walls: (5,5) is within bounds, not an internal obstacle (internal is (5,6)).\n  - Snake body: (5,5) is the 8th segment (from head). So it's part of the body. Collision. Deadly. Cannot move U.\n\n#### 3. Move Down (D) to (5,3)\n- New head position: (5,3)\n- Check safety:\n  - Walls: (5,3) is within bounds, not an obstacle.\n  - Snake body: Is (5,3) in the snake's body? Looking through the list: no, it's not listed. So safe.\n- Food at (5,3)? No, food is at (6,4), (6,5), (1,3). So no food to eat here.\n- This move is safe but doesn't eat food.\n\n### Checking for Food Opportunities\n\nNow, let's see if any food is reachable safely in the next move.\n\n**Food at (6,4)**:\n- Value=1, life_span=1 (will disappear after this turn)\n- Currently at (5,4), to reach (6,4) need to move R, but we saw that's deadly (collides with body at (6,4)).\n\n**Food at (6,5)**:\n- Value=4, life_span=1\n- To reach (6,5) from (5,4), need to move U to (5,5), then next move could be R to (6,5). But moving U to (5,5) is deadly as it's part of the body.\n\n**Food at (1,3)**:\n- Value=10, life_span=1\n- From (5,4), to reach (1,3) would take multiple moves, but it's too far to reach in one move. So not immediately accessible.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger Check\n\nIs the head adjacent to the tail, and is there positive food at the tail?\n- Tail is at (5,1).\n- Head is at (5,4). Adjacent means one cell apart in x or y. (5,4) and (5,1) are 3 apart in y, not adjacent.\n- So no tail reward danger here.\n\n### Available Moves Summary\n\nFrom above:\n- R: deadly (collision with body at (6,4))\n- U: deadly (collision with body at (5,5))\n- L: invalid (instant reverse from R)\n- D: safe, no food\n\nOnly possible safe move is D to (5,3).\n\n### Verifying No Other Options\n\nIs there any other way to reach food safely? \n\nLooking at the snake's body, it's quite long and coiled, making many directions deadly. The only safe move is D, even though it doesn't eat food. \n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe only safe move is Down (D) to (5,3). \n\n\\boxed{D}",

The tail is at (6,1), so (6,5) is not the tail.\n   - Therefore, we cannot eat (6,5) now because it's under the body and not the tail.\n\n2. **Food at (1,3)**:\n   - Current position: (5,3).\n   - To reach (1,3), we'd need to move left four times.\n   - First move left to (4,3), then (3,3), (2,3), (1,3).\n   - Need to check if this path is safe:\n     - (4,3): safe (no body, no wall)\n     - (3,3): not part of body (body is at (3,4), (3,5))\n     - (2,3): not part of body (body is at (2,4), (2,5))\n     - (1,3): not part of body, not a wall\n   - Seems like a possible path, but it's several moves away.\n   - The food at (1,3) has a life_span of 9, and current turn is 38, so it will disappear at turn 38 + 9 = 47.\n   - We have time to reach it, but need to plan carefully.\n\n### Immediate Action\n\nGiven that only Left (L) is safe right now, and the other moves are deadly, the immediate action must be Left.\n\n### Verifying Tail Reward Danger\n\nIs there any danger related to the tail and food?\n- Tail is at (6,1).\n- Adjacent cells to head (5,3):\n  - Left: (4,3)\n  - Right: (6,3)\n  - Down: (5,4)\n  - Up: (5,2) (but current direction is Down, so cannot move Up)\n- Food is at (6,5) and (1,3).

Invalid move.\n\n3. **Turn Down (D)**: Move to (4,2)\n   - Check (4,2):\n     - Not a wall.\n     - Not in snake's body: Checking the list, (4,2) is not present.\n     - Valid move.\n\n4. **Turn Right (R)**: Opposite of current direction (L), so invalid due to \"No instant reverse\" rule.\n\nThus, valid immediate moves are: Left (L) or Down (D).\n\n### Evaluating Valid Moves\n\n**Option 1: Move Left (L) to (3,3)**\n- New head position: (3,3)\n- Check for food at (3,3): No food is listed there.\n- Snake's tail is at (6,2), which will move to (6,3) as the snake advances.\n- No immediate reward or penalty.\n- After moving left, the next possible moves would be from (3,3):\n  - Continue L to (2,3): \n    - (2,3) is not a wall or body (except (2,4), (2,5) are body, but (2,3) is safe).\n  - Turn U to (3,4): \n    - (3,4) is body (4th segment), collision.\n  - Turn D to (3,2): \n    - Safe.\n  \n**Option 2: Move Down (D) to (4,2)**\n- New head position: (4,2)\n- Check for food at (4,2): No food there.\n- Snake's tail moves to (6,3).\n- No immediate reward or penalty.\n- After moving down, next possible moves from (4,2):\n  - Continue D to (4,1): \n    - (4,1) is not a wall or body.\n  - Turn L to (3,2): \n    - Safe.\n  - Turn R to (5,2): \n    - (5,2) is not a wall or body.\n\n### Considering Food\n\nNow, let's consider the food items:\n\n1. **Food at (6,5)**:\n   - Current position: (6,5) is occupied by the snake's body (10th segment).\n   - To eat this, the body must move away, and then the head moves onto it.\n   - Currently, the head is at (4,3), and (6,5) is two steps right and two steps up.\n   - It's not immediately accessible; we'd need to maneuver the snake to free (6,5) and then reach it.\n   - Life_span = 3, meaning it will disappear after 3 more turns (including current turn if not eaten now).\n   - Given the distance and time, it's unlikely we can reach it in time.\n\n2. **Food at (1,3)**:\n   - Position: (1,3)\n   - Currently, head is at (4,3), moving left to (3,3) would be a step towards it.\n   - Distance: from (4,3) to (1,3) is 3 steps left.\n   - Life_span = 8, so plenty of time.\n   - To reach (1,3):\n     - Next move: L to (3,3)\n     - Then L to (2,3)\n     - Then L to (1,3)\n   - Need to ensure that during these moves, the path remains clear and no collisions occur.\n   - Currently, the body segments near this path are:\n     - (2,4), (2,5), (3,4), (3,5), etc., which are above the path.\n     - Moving left to (3,3), (2,3), (1,3) seems safe as these cells are not occupied by the body.\n\n### Potential Risks\n\n- **Tail Reward Danger**: \n  - The tail is at (6,2), and there's no food there, so no danger from that.\n  \n- **Collision with Body**:\n  - Moving up to (4,4) is invalid as it's body.\n  - Other moves are safe as checked.\n\n### Decision Making\n\nGiven the two valid immediate moves (L or D):\n\n1. **Move Left (L)**:\n   - Moves towards the food at (1,3).\n   - Safe path with no immediate collision.\n   - Progress towards gaining +1 score.\n\n2. **Move Down (D)**:\n   - Moves away from both foods.\n   - Doesn't contribute to score immediately.\n   - Keeps options open but doesn't capitalize on the available food.\n\nGiven that the food at (1,3) is safe to pursue and has a long life_span, moving towards it is advantageous. The food at (6,5) is too far and will disappear soon, so it's not worth pursuing.\n\n### Verifying Immediate Move Safety\n\n- **Move Left to (3,3)**:\n  - Current body segments after head: (5,3), (5,4), etc.\n  - (3,3) is not in the body list.\n  - Not a wall.\n  - Not reversing direction.\n  - Safe.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe best immediate action is to move **Left (L)** towards the food at (1,3), which is safe and beneficial for scoring.\n\n\\boxed{L}",

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State\n\nFirst, let's break down the current state to understand the scenario:\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The game is played on an 8x8 grid (since x and y range from 0 to 7).\n2. **Walls**:\n   - **Border Walls**: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. These are the edges of the grid.\n   - **Internal Obstacle**: (5,6) is a single internal wall.\n3. **Snake**:\n   - **Positions**: The snake's body is represented by a list of coordinates starting from the head. The head is at (3,3), and the body follows until the tail at (6,3).\n   - **Current Direction**: The snake is currently moving Left (L).\n4. **Food**:\n   - (6,5): Value = 2, Life Span = 1\n   - (1,3): Value = 7, Life Span = 1\n   - (3,4): Value = 10, Life Span = 1\n\n### Visualizing the Snake and Food\n\nLet's visualize the snake's body to understand its shape and possible movements:\n\n- Head: (3,3)\n- Body segments: (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3)\n\nThis seems like a long snake with many turns. The food items are at:\n\n1. (6,5): This is actually the position of the 12th segment of the snake (counting from head as 1). So, this food is under the snake's body.\n2. (1,3): This is to the left of the head, but there's a wall at x=0, so moving left is limited.\n3. (3,4): This is directly above the head (since (3,3) to (3,4) is Up), but (3,4) is the 6th segment of the snake.\n\n### Food Mechanics\n\nFrom the rules:\n\n- Food under the body can only be eaten if:\n  1. The body moves away from that cell.\n  2. The head moves onto the food cell.\n  \nFor (6,5), which is under the snake's body, to eat it:\n- The snake's body must move away from (6,5), meaning the segment at (6,5) moves to (6,4) or elsewhere.\n- Then, the head must move to (6,5).\n\nBut currently, the head is at (3,3), which is far from (6,5). It's impractical to reach (6,5) in one move, so this food is not immediately accessible.\n\nFor (3,4), which is also under the snake's body (6th segment), similar logic applies. The head is at (3,3), and (3,4) is directly above. To eat this:\n- The body must move away from (3,4).\n- Then, the head moves Up to (3,4).\n\nBut currently, the segment after (3,4) is (2,4), so if the head moves Up to (3,4), the next segment would be (4,3), then (5,3), etc., so (3,4) would be vacated. But the head moving to (3,4) would immediately collide with the next segment (4,3), because after moving Up, the new head is at (3,4), and the next segment is (3,3), which is where the head was, so no collision yet. Wait, let's trace the movement:\n\nCurrent head: (3,3)\nMove Up to (3,4)\nNew positions:\nHead: (3,4)\nThen: (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), etc.\n\nNow, is (3,4) in the rest of the body? The next segment is (3,3), which is not (3,4), so no collision. But (3,4) was previously occupied by the 6th segment, which is now moving to (3,3), so (3,4) is vacated, and the head moves there. \n\nBut the food at (3,4) has value 10, which is high. However, the life span is 1, meaning it will disappear after this turn if not eaten now.\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nCurrent direction is Left (L). Possible moves (cannot reverse to Right immediately):\n\n- Left (L): (3,3) to (2,3)\n- Up (U): (3,3) to (3,4)\n- Down (D): (3,3) to (3,2)\n\nLet's evaluate each:\n\n1. **Left (L) to (2,3)**:\n   - Check for walls: x=0 is a wall, (2,3) is not a wall.\n   - Check for body collision: The body segments are (4,3), (5,3), etc., so (2,3) is not in the body.\n   - Food at (1,3) is to the left, but moving Left now would take us to (2,3), not directly to (1,3). Next turn could move Left to (1,3) to eat the food (value 7, life span 1), but it will disappear after this turn, so we can't reach it in time.\n   - No immediate food to eat.\n   - Safe move, but no reward.\n\n2. **Up (U) to (3,4)**:\n   - (3,4) is currently occupied by the 6th segment, but as explained, moving Up would vacate (3,4) as the body moves.\n   - The food at (3,4) has value 10, life span 1, so it will disappear after this turn.\n   - After moving Up, the head is at (3,4), which is where the food is, and the body has moved away, so we can eat it.\n   - Check for Tail Reward Danger: The tail is at (6,3). The new tail after eating would be the previous tail, which is (6,3), but the head is at (3,4), not adjacent to (6,3), so no danger.\n   - High reward (10), safe.\n\n3. **Down (D) to (3,2)**:\n   - (3,2) is not a wall (y=0 is a wall, but y=2 is not).\n   - Check body: (3,2) is not in the body segments.\n   - No food at (3,2).\n   - Safe move, but no reward.\n\n### Evaluating Best Move\n\n- Up (U): Eat high-value food (10), safe.\n- Left (L): Safe, no reward.\n- Down (D): Safe, no reward.\n\nThe food at (3,4) is about to disappear, and we can eat it safely for a high reward. The other foods are either unreachable in time or not as valuable.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Collisions\n\nFor Up move:\n- New head position: (3,4)\n- Body segments after move: (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), etc.\n- Is (3,4) in the new body? No, the body starts at (3,3), which is different.\n- No collision.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe best immediate action is to move Up to eat the high-value food at (3,4) before it disappears.\n\n\\boxed{U}",
