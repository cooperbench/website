        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The cars move left or right with constant speed, and I have to make sure that when I'm on a freeway row at a certain turn, the car on that row doesn't have 0 in its span at that turn.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the car positions are at turn t_1, which is turn 0 here. The initial state is given for turn 0.\n\nPlayer is at (0,0), so y=0. But the freeways are from y=1 to y=8, so at y=0, there are no cars, I think. The collision is only considered when I'm on a freeway, meaning y from 1 to 8. So starting at y=0 is safe, and ending at y=9 is also safe since no cars there.\n\nNow, let's list all the cars for each freeway row.\n\nFreeway 1 (y=1): two cars\n\n- First car: head 48, tail 37, direction right, speed 4. Since direction is right, the span is [tail, head] = [37,48], and it's moving right, so at time t, position is [37 + 4(t - t1), 48 + 4(t - t1)] = [37 + 4t, 48 + 4t] since t1=0.\n\nt1 is 0, so for turn T, the span is [37 + 4T, 48 + 4T] for this car.\n\nSimilarly, second car on y=1: head 0, tail -11, direction right, speed 4. So span at T: [tail + sT, head + sT] = [-11 + 4T, 0 + 4T] = [-11 + 4T, 4T]\n\nNow, collision occurs if 0 is in the span for that row at that turn.\n\nFor y=1, at turn T, 0 is in span if either:\n\n- For first car: 37 + 4T ≤ 0 ≤ 48 + 4T? But 37 + 4T is positive for T≥0, so 0 is less than that, so never in [37+4T,48+4T] since min is 37 at T=0.\n\nAt T=0, min is 37, max 48, 0<37, so not in span. As T increases, it moves right, so even larger, so 0 never in span for first car.\n\nSecond car: span [-11+4T, 4T], so 0 in span if -11+4T ≤ 0 ≤ 4T.\n\nSince -11+4T ≤ 4T always, so we need -11+4T ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ 4T.\n\n0 ≤ 4T is true for T≥0, and -11+4T ≤ 0 implies 4T ≤ 11, T ≤ 11/4 = 2.75, so T≤2 since turns are integers.\n\nT from 0 up, integer.\n\nSo for T=0: -11≤0≤0? 0≤0 is true, and -11≤0 true, so yes, 0 in span at T=0.\n\nT=1: [-11+4,4] = [-7,4], -7≤0≤4, yes.\n\nT=2: [-11+8,8] = [-3,8], -3≤0≤8, yes.\n\nT=3: [-11+12,12] = [1,12], 1≤0? 1>0, so 0 not in [1,12], since 1>0.\n\nSimilarly, T=4: [5,16], etc. 0 not in.\n\nSo for y=1, collision at T=0,1,2.\n\nBut at T=0, I'm at y=0, not on freeway, so no collision. When I move to y=1, it's at turn T when I am on y=1.\n\nLet's clarify the timing.\n\nAt turn T, I am at position y_T. If y_T is between 1 and 8, then I check if 0 is in the car span on that row at turn T.\n\nIf I decide to move, at turn T, I choose action a_T, which determines y_{T+1}.\n\nBut the position during turn T is y_T, and that's when I might be on a freeway row.\n\nThe collision condition says: \"collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd y_T is the position at turn T.\n\nAlso, note that when I move to a different row, I am not on that row until the next turn.\n\nFrom the note: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nSo, at turn T, I am on row y_T. I choose action a_T, which affects y_{T+1}.\n\nIf I change rows, at turn T, I am still on y_T, not on y_{T+1}.\n\nFor the car, at turn T, we use Span(T) for the row I am on, which is y_T.\n\nNow, back to freeway 1.\n\nAt turn T, for y=1, there is a car that causes collision when 0 is in its span, which for the second car is when T=0,1,2.\n\nSpecifically, at T=0,1,2, 0 is in [-11+4T, 4T] for T=0,1,2.\n\nFirst car never has 0 in span.\n\nSo on y=1, it is dangerous at T=0,1,2. But at T=0, I am at y=0, so not on y=1, so no issue. But if I am on y=1 at turn T, and T=0,1,2, collision.\n\nT=0 is turn 0, I am at y=0, not on y=1.\n\nIf I go to y=1 at turn 1, for example.\n\nLet's list for each freeway and for each turn, whether 0 is occupied by a car.\n\nBut the car spans are moving, so for each row, I need to find when 0 is covered.\n\nAlso, multiple cars per row, but if any car has 0 in span, it's collision.\n\nNow freeway 2 (y=2): one car: head 48, tail 71, direction left, speed 24.\n\nDirection left, so for left-moving, span at t1 is [h, τ] = [48,71]? Head and tail.\n\nIn the car update: for left-moving, span(t1) = [h, τ] → span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nHere head h=48, tail τ=71, direction left, s=24.\n\nBut typically, for left-moving, head is on the left, I think? Let's see the notation.\n\nIn the update, for left-moving: span(t1) = [h, τ] and then [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT]\n\nSince it's moving left, the positions decrease.\n\nNow, at t1=0, span [48,71], so head at 48, tail at 71? But if moving left, usually head is the front, so if left-moving, head should be smaller number if we think x increasing right.\n\nPerhaps I need to interpret the coordinates.\n\nAssume x-axis, with x=0 being the point we care about.\n\nCars have a head and tail; for right-moving, head is greater than tail; for left-moving, head is less than tail? But in the description, it's given as (head, tail, dir, speed).\n\nFor freeway 1, first car: (48,37,right,4), so head=48, tail=37, since right-moving, head > tail, span [tail, head] = [37,48].\n\nSecond car: (0,-11,right,4), head=0, tail=-11, span [tail,head] = [-11,0].\n\nFor left-moving, freeway 2: (48,71,left,24), head=48, tail=71, but if left-moving and head=48, tail=71, that would mean head is at 48, tail at 71, so if moving left, the car is from 48 to 71, but 48 to 71 is to the right, and moving left, so head should be 71, tail 48? I think there's inconsistency.\n\nLook at the update rule.\n\nFor left-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\"\n\nIf h and τ are such that for left-moving, h should be the leftmost point or what?\n\nAt t1, for left-moving, span is [h, τ], and it moves left, so both decrease.\n\nIn this case, for freeway 2, (48,71,left,24), so at T, span [48 - 24T, 71 - 24T]\n\nNow, 0 in span if 48-24T ≤ 0 ≤ 71-24T.\n\nSince 48-24T ≤ 71-24T always.\n\nSo 48-24T ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ 71-24T.\n\nFirst inequality: 48-24T ≤ 0 ⇒ 48 ≤ 24T ⇒ T ≥ 48/24 = 2\n\nSecond inequality: 0 ≤ 71-24T ⇒ 24T ≤ 71 ⇒ T ≤ 71/24 ≈ 2.958, so T ≤ 2 since integer.\n\nT ≥2 and T≤2, so only T=2.\n\nAt T=2: [48-48, 71-48] = [0,23], so 0 is included.\n\nAt T=1: [48-24,71-24] = [24,47], 0 not in.\n\nT=3: [48-72,71-72] = [-24,-1], 0 not in.\n\nSo on y=2, collision only at T=2.\n\nNow freeway 3 (y=3): (-48,-83,right,36)\n\nDirection right, so span [tail, head] = [-83, -48]? Head and tail.\n\nGiven (head, tail, dir, speed) = (-48,-83,right,36)\n\nSince right-moving, span should be [tail, head] = [-83, -48]\n\nAt T, span [-83 + 36T, -48 + 36T]\n\n0 in span if -83 +36T ≤ 0 ≤ -48 +36T\n\nWhich is equivalent to -83+36T ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ -48+36T\n\nFirst: -83+36T ≤ 0 ⇒ 36T ≤ 83 ⇒ T ≤ 83/36 ≈ 2.305, so T≤2\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -48+36T ⇒ 48 ≤ 36T ⇒ T ≥ 48/36 = 4/3 ≈1.333, so T≥2 since integer? T≥ ceil(1.333) = 2? Let's see.\n\nT min from second: 48 ≤ 36T ⇒ T ≥ 48/36 = 4/3 ≈1.333, so since T integer, T≥2\n\nT max from first: T≤2.305, so T≤2\n\nSo T=2 only.\n\nAt T=2: [-83+72, -48+72] = [-11,24], 0 in [-11,24] yes.\n\nT=1: [-83+36, -48+36] = [-47,-12], 0 not in.\n\nT=3: [-83+108, -48+108] = [25,60], 0 not in.\n\nSo y=3 dangerous at T=2.\n\nNow freeway 4 (y=4): (48,37,right,12)\n\nSimilar to before, head=48, tail=37, right, s=12\n\nSpan at T: [37 + 12T, 48 + 12T]\n\n0 in span: 37+12T ≤ 0 ≤ 48+12T? 37+12T ≥37>0 for T≥0, so never ≤0, so 0 not in span. Safe for all T.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 5 (y=5): (48,37,right,12) same as above, safe.\n\nFreeway 6 (y=6): (48,37,right,12) same, safe.\n\nFreeway 7 (y=7): (-48,-83,right,36) same as freeway 3.\n\nhead=-48, tail=-83, right, s=36\n\nSpan [tail, head] = [-83, -48] at T: [-83+36T, -48+36T]\n\n0 in span: -83+36T ≤0 ≤ -48+36T\n\nAs before, T=2 only.\n\nT=2: [-83+72, -48+72]=[-11,24], yes 0 in.\n\nT=1: [-47,-12], no; T=3:[25,60], no.\n\nSo y=7 dangerous at T=2.\n\nNow freeway 8 (y=8): three cars.\n\nFirst: (48,37,right,4) head=48,tail=37,right,s=4\n\nSpan [37+4T,48+4T], min 37>0, never 0 in, safe.\n\nSecond: (12,1,right,4) head=12,tail=1,right,s=4\n\nSpan [1+4T,12+4T]\n\n0 in span: 1+4T ≤0 ≤12+4T? 1+4T ≥1>0, so never ≤0, 0 not in. Safe.\n\nThird: (-24,-35,right,4) head=-24,tail=-35,right,s=4\n\nSpan [tail, head] = [-35, -24] at T: [-35+4T, -24+4T]\n\n0 in span: -35+4T ≤0 ≤ -24+4T\n\nFirst: -35+4T ≤0 ⇒ 4T≤35 ⇒ T≤35/4=8.75, so T≤8\n\nSecond: 0≤ -24+4T ⇒ 24≤4T ⇒ T≥6\n\nSo T from 6 to 8 inclusive.\n\nAt T=6: [-35+24, -24+24] = [-11,0], 0 in.\n\nT=7: [-35+28, -24+28] = [-7,4], 0 in.\n\nT=8: [-35+32, -24+32] = [-3,8], 0 in.\n\nT=9: [-35+36, -24+36] = [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo on y=8, dangerous at T=6,7,8 due to this car.\n\nOther cars safe.\n\nNow, summarize for each row, the dangerous turns when 0 is occupied:\n\n- y=1: dangerous at T=0,1,2 (from second car)\n\nBut T=0: at turn 0, if I am on y=1, but I start at y=0, so for later.\n\n- y=2: dangerous only at T=2\n\n- y=3: dangerous only at T=2\n\n- y=4: always safe\n\n- y=5: always safe\n\n- y=6: always safe\n\n- y=7: dangerous only at T=2\n\n- y=8: dangerous at T=6,7,8\n\ny=1 dangerous at T=1 and T=2? T=0,1,2 but T=0 not relevant if not on row.\n\nNow, I start at (0,0) at T=0. I need to reach (0,9).\n\nI move by changing y with actions U, D, S, so y changes by +1, -1, or 0 each turn.\n\ny must be between 0 and 9.\n\nSince I start at y=0 and need to go to y=9, and rows 1-8 have cars, I need to pass through them.\n\nThe minimal number of turns: since I need to go from y=0 to y=9, the minimum possible is 9 moves up, but I can move up or down or stay, but to minimize turns, I should go up as much as possible, but I have to avoid the dangerous times on each row.\n\nSince I can stay or move down, I might need to delay or something.\n\nBut let's think of the path.\n\nI need to be at y=9 at some turn.\n\ny=9 is safe, no cars.\n\nThe turns: let T be the turn number, starting from T=0.\n\nAt T=0, y=0.\n\nI need to choose actions for each turn.\n\nThe position y_T depends on previous actions.\n\nI need to reach y=9 as soon as possible, but avoiding being on a dangerous row at a dangerous time.\n\nSpecifically, for each turn T, if y_T is between 1 and 8, then it must not be that 0 is in the car span on that row at turn T.\n\ny_T is the row I am on at turn T.\n\nNow, let's list the safe times for each row:\n\nFor y=1: dangerous at T=1,2? From above, on y=1, collision if T=1 or T=2? At T=1, span for second car: [-11+4*1, 4*1] = [-7,4], 0 in; T=2: [-3,8], 0 in; T=0: but T=0 not on row if I am elsewhere.\n\nFor row y=1, it is dangerous when T=1,2 (since at T=0, if I were on y=1, but I start at y=0, so T=0 not possible for y=1)\n\nSimilarly, T=3 and above safe.\n\nSo for y=1, safe for T ≥ 3.\n\nT=3: [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, y=2: dangerous only at T=2, so safe for T≠2.\n\ny=3: dangerous only at T=2, safe for T≠2.\n\ny=4: always safe.\n\ny=5: always safe.\n\ny=6: always safe.\n\ny=7: dangerous at T=2, safe otherwise.\n\ny=8: dangerous at T=6,7,8, so safe for T<6 or T>8.\n\nNow, I start at T=0, y=0.\n\nI need to get to y=9.\n\nEach move changes y by at most 1, so to go from 0 to 9, minimum 9 moves up, taking 9 turns, but since I start at T=0, after H turns, I am at turn T=H-1? Let's see.\n\nAt turn T, after choosing action, I move to y_{T+1}, but the position is y_T at turn T.\n\nDefine: at the start of turn T, I am at position y_T.\n\nThen I choose action a_T, which determines y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy_T, with Δy based on a_T.\n\nThen at turn T+1, I am at y_{T+1}, and so on.\n\nAt turn T, I am at y_T, and collision check based on y_T and T.\n\nI start at turn 0, y_0 = 0.\n\nI need to have y_{t_f} = 9 for some turn t_f, and minimize the number of turns, so minimize t_f.\n\nSince I start at T=0, the first action is at T=0, moving to y_1, etc., but position at turn T is y_T.\n\nAfter H actions, I have positions from y_0 to y_H, and I need y_H = 9 for some H, and H is the number of turns from start.\n\nTurn indices: turns are t_1 + t, but here t_1=0, so turns T=0,1,2,...\n\nI need y_T = 9 for some T, and find min T such that I can reach with a sequence.\n\nSince y changes by at most 1 per turn, min T is 9, if I go up every turn: actions U,U,U,U,U,U,U,U,U so y_T = T for T=0 to 9, y_9=9.\n\nBut I need to check if during T=1 to 8, when on rows 1 to 8, it is safe.\n\nNow, for each row and time:\n\nAt T=1, y=1: but y=1 is dangerous at T=1 (since collision at T=1), so if I am on y=1 at T=1, collision.\n\nIn this path, at T=1, y=1, and it is dangerous, so collision.\n\nNot possible.\n\nSimilarly, at T=2, if I were on y=2, dangerous, but in this path at T=2, y=2, which is dangerous at T=2.\n\nSo straight up not possible.\n\nI need to avoid being on certain rows at certain times.\n\nSpecifically, I need to not be on y=1 at T=1 or T=2.\n\nNot on y=2 at T=2.\n\nNot on y=3 at T=2.\n\nNot on y=7 at T=2.\n\nNot on y=8 at T=6,7,8.\n\ny=4,5,6 always safe.\n\ny=1 safe only for T≥3.\n\ny=2 safe for T≠2, etc.\n\nSince min T to reach y=9 is 9, but with obstacles, it might take more turns.\n\nI might need to stay or move down to wait for safe time.\n\nBut moving down might not help directly, since I need to go up eventually.\n\nI should consider the time when I can be on each row.\n\nFor example, to be on y=1, I must be at T≥3.\n\nSimilarly, for y=2, I can be at any T except 2.\n\nBut since I start at T=0, y=0, I can go to y=1 only after T=0.\n\nI need to go from y=0 to y=1, which takes one up move.\n\nSimilarly between rows.\n\nLet me consider the earliest time I can be on each row.\n\nBut it depends on the path.\n\nSince the dangerous times are sparse, I might find a path that avoids them.\n\nList the constraints:\n\n- I cannot be on y=1 at T=1 or T=2. So if on y=1, T≥3.\n\n- Cannot be on y=2 at T=2.\n\n- Cannot be on y=3 at T=2.\n\n- Cannot be on y=7 at T=2.\n\n- Cannot be on y=8 at T=6,7,8.\n\n- y=4,5,6 always safe.\n\ny=7 dangerous only at T=2, so can be at T≠2.\n\ny=3 dangerous only at T=2, so can be at T≠2.\n\nNow, I need to reach y=9.\n\nSince y=0 at T=0.\n\nI need to move to higher y.\n\nOne way is to go to y=4,5,6 as soon as possible, since they are always safe.\n\nBut to get to y=4, I need to pass through y=1,2,3.\n\ny=1 must be visited at T≥3.\n\nSimilarly, y=2 and y=3 cannot be at T=2.\n\nI could stay at y=0 for a few turns.\n\ny=0 is safe, no cars.\n\nThen go up when safe.\n\nStart at T=0, y=0.\n\nIf I stay at y=0, I can stay for multiple turns.\n\nBut to minimize time, I should move when possible.\n\nFirst, I cannot go to y=1 at T=1, because if I go to y=1 at T=1, then at turn T=1, I am on y=1, which is dangerous.\n\nSimilarly, if I go to y=1 at T=2, on y=1 at T=2, dangerous.\n\nSo I can only go to y=1 at T≥3.\n\nAt T=0, I am at y=0.\n\nI choose action: if I go up, at T=1 I am at y=1, but dangerous, so not good.\n\nIf I stay, at T=1 I am still at y=0.\n\nThen at T=1, I can choose to stay or go up or down, but down to y=-1? No, y in [0,9], so y=0, cannot go down, I assume. From the player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, and y_{t+1} in [0,9], so if y_t=0, Δy cannot be -1, so a_t cannot be D, only U or S.\n\nSimilarly, at y=9, cannot go up.\n\nSo at y=0, actions: U or S.\n\nIf U, y_{t+1}=1; if S, y_{t+1}=0.\n\nSimilarly at other points.\n\nBack to T=0, y=0.\n\nIf I do S, stay, then at T=1, y=0.\n\nThen at T=1, still y=0, I can do S again or U.\n\nIf I do U at T=1, to y=2? No, from y=0, U to y=1.\n\nBut at T=1, if I go to y=1, then at turn T=1, position y=1, which is dangerous for y=1 at T=1.\n\nSo collision.\n\nTherefore, I cannot go to y=1 at T=1.\n\nSimilarly, if I do U at T=2 from y=0 or something.\n\nAt T=1, if I am at y=0, and I do S, stay at y=0.\n\nThen at T=2, y=0.\n\nNow at T=2, I can do U to go to y=1 at T=3? Let's see actions.\n\nAt turn T, I choose a_T, which affects y_{T+1}.\n\nAt turn T, position y_T.\n\nChoose a_T, then y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy_T.\n\nThen at turn T+1, position y_{T+1}.\n\nFor example, T=0, y=0.\n\nIf a_0 = S, then y_1 = 0.\n\nIf a_0 = U, y_1 =1.\n\nBut if y_1=1, at turn T=1, position y=1, which is dangerous since y=1 dangerous at T=1.\n\nSo not good.\n\nIf a_0=S, y_1=0.\n\nThen at T=1, y=1? No, at turn T=1, position is y_1.\n\nIf y_1=0, then at T=1, I am on y=0, safe.\n\nThen I choose a_1.\n\nIf a_1 = S, y_2=0.\n\nIf a_1 = U, y_2=1.\n\nThen at turn T=2, position y_2.\n\nIf y_2=1, then on y=1 at T=2, which is dangerous (since y=1 dangerous at T=2).\n\nSo again collision.\n\nTherefore, I cannot be on y=1 at T=1 or T=2, so the only way is to be on y=1 at some T≥3.\n\nSimilarly, for that, I need to go to y=1 from y=0 at some turn when I choose U when at y=0.\n\nSuppose at some turn K, I am at y=0, and I choose U, then y_{K+1}=1.\n\nThen at turn K+1, I am on y=1.\n\nThis must be at K+1 ≥3, so K+1 ≥3, K≥2.\n\nSo I can go to y=1 only at turn M where M≥3, meaning I arrive at y=1 at turn M≥3.\n\nFor example, at turn K, I am at y=0, choose U, then at turn K+1, I am at y=1.\n\nSo turn when on y=1 is K+1, so K+1≥3, K≥2.\n\nSimilarly, I can stay at y=0 until I decide to go up.\n\nBut to minimize time, I should go as soon as possible.\n\nEarliest I can be on y=1 is T=3.\n\nAt T=3, on y=1, which is safe, since y=1 safe for T≥3.\n\nHow to be on y=1 at T=3.\n\nAt T=3, position y_3=1.\n\nThat means, at T=2, I must have been at y=0 or y=1 or y=2, but with action to reach y=1 at T=3.\n\ny_3 = y_2 + Δy_2.\n\nIf y_2 =0, and a_2=U, then y_3=1.\n\nIf y_2=1, and a_2=S or D, but D to y=0, not to 1.\n\nTo have y_3=1, possible from:\n\n- y_2=0 and a_2=U\n\n- or y_2=1 and a_2=S\n\n- or y_2=2 and a_2=D\n\nBut y_2=2 and a_2=D would go to y=1, but at turn T=2, if I am on y=2, it is dangerous, since y=2 dangerous at T=2.\n\nSimilarly, if y_2=1 and a_2=S, then at T=2, I am on y=1, which is dangerous at T=2.\n\nTherefore, the only safe way to be at y=1 at T=3 is to be at y=0 at T=2 and choose U at T=2, so y_3=1.\n\nThen at T=3, y=1, safe.\n\nNow, similarly, for other rows.\n\nFirst, I need to get to y=0 at T=2.\n\nStart at T=0, y=0.\n\nAt T=0, I can choose S or U.\n\nBut if U, to y=1 at T=1, dangerous.\n\nSo must choose S at T=0, so y_1=0.\n\nThen at T=1, y=1? No, at T=1, position y_1=0.\n\nThen I need to be at y=0 at T=2 for the above.\n\nAt T=1, I am at y=0, I can choose S or U.\n\nIf U, to y=1 at T=2, but at T=2, on y=1, dangerous.\n\nSo I must choose S at T=1, so y_2=0.\n\nThen at T=2, y=0, safe.\n\nThen choose a_2=U, so y_3=1.\n\nAt T=3, y=1, safe.\n\nNow, from here, I need to go to higher rows.\n\nNext, I can go to y=2.\n\ny=2 is dangerous only at T=2, but T=2 is past, so for T>2, y=2 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=3 dangerous only at T=2, so safe for T>2.\n\ny=7 dangerous only at T=2, safe otherwise.\n\ny=8 dangerous at T=6,7,8.\n\nNow, at T=3, I am at y=1.\n\nI can choose to go up to y=2 or stay or down, but down to y=0, which might not be efficient.\n\nTo minimize time, go up.\n\nSo at T=3, choose U, then y_4=2.\n\nAt turn T=4, position y=2, which is safe since T=4≠2.\n\nSimilarly, at T=4, I can go to y=3, choose U, y_5=3.\n\nAt T=5, y=3, safe since T=5≠2.\n\nThen from y=3, I can go to y=4, U, y_6=4.\n\nT=6, y=4, safe.\n\ny=4 always safe.\n\nThen to y=5, U, y_7=5.\n\nT=7, y=5, safe.\n\nTo y=6, U, y_8=6.\n\nT=8, y=6, safe.\n\nNow, from y=6 to y=7.\n\ny=7 is safe except at T=2, which is past, so safe.\n\nBut at T=8, I am at y=6.\n\nChoose U, to y=7, y_9=7.\n\nAt turn T=9, position y=7, safe.\n\nThen to y=8, U, y_10=8.\n\nAt turn T=10, position y=8.\n\nBut y=8 is dangerous at T=6,7,8.\n\nT=10 >8, so safe, since dangerous only up to T=8.\n\nT=10, y=8, should be safe.\n\ny=8 dangerous at T=6,7,8, so for T=9 and above, safe.\n\nT=10>8, safe.\n\nThen at T=10, on y=8, I can go to y=9, U, y_11=9.\n\nAt turn T=11, position y=9, which is not a freeway, so no car, safe.\n\nAnd I reached y=9 at T=11.\n\nBut is this minimal? T=11 turns from start.\n\nAt T=0 to T=11, that's 12 positions? Turns: T=0 to T=11, that's 12 turns, but position at T=11.\n\nNumber of actions: from T=0 to T=10, I choose actions, 11 actions, to reach y_11=9.\n\nAt T=0, start, no action yet? Let's clarify.\n\nThe turn sequence: turn t_1 + t for t=0 to H-1, but t_1=0.\n\nGiven: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" so actions from t=0 to H-1, meaning H actions.\n\nAfter H actions, I reach some state.\n\nBut the position: at turn T, after t actions from start? Better to think in terms of turn index.\n\nSet T as the turn number, starting from T=0.\n\nAt turn T, position y_T.\n\nAfter choosing action a_T, I go to y_{T+1}.\n\nI start at T=0, y_0=0.\n\nI need y_T =9 for some T.\n\nIn the above, with actions:\n\nT=0: y=0, choose S (since cannot U)\n\nIn my earlier, I did:\n\nT=0: y=0, a_0=S, so y_1=0\n\nT=1: y=0, a_1=S, y_2=0\n\nT=2: y=0, a_2=U, y_3=1\n\nT=3: y=1, a_3=U, y_4=2\n\nT=4: y=2, a_4=U, y_5=3\n\nT=5: y=3, a_5=U, y_6=4\n\nT=6: y=4, a_6=U, y_7=5\n\nT=7: y=5, a_7=U, y_8=6\n\nT=8: y=6, a_8=U, y_9=7\n\nT=9: y=7, a_9=U, y_10=8\n\nT=10: y=8, a_10=U, y_11=9\n\nSo at T=11, y=9.\n\nT from 0 to 11, that's 12 turns, but y_11=9 at turn 11.\n\nNumber of actions: from T=0 to T=10, that's 11 actions.\n\nH should be the number of turns or actions?\n\nThe sequence is actions from t=0 to H-1, so H actions.\n\nAfter H actions, I reach y_{t_1 + H}, but t_1=0, so y_H.\n\nIn this case, after 11 actions, y_11=9.\n\nBut T=11 is the turn when I am at y=9.\n\nMinimal T to reach y=9.\n\nCan I do better?\n\nIn the above, I stayed at y=0 for two turns, then went up continuously to y=9, arriving at T=11.\n\nBut I could go faster to higher rows.\n\nFor example, after being on y=1 at T=3, I went to y=2 at T=4, y=3 at T=5, etc.\n\nBut y=4,5,6 are always safe, so I could go directly to them earlier, but I have to go through lower rows.\n\nSince y=2 and y=3 are safe after T=2, and I can be on y=1 at T=3, then I can go up quickly.\n\nAnother point: y=8 is dangerous at T=6,7,8, but I arrived at y=8 at T=10, which is fine.\n\nBut perhaps I can arrive at y=9 earlier.\n\nFor example, if I can be on y=1 earlier, but I cannot before T=3.\n\nEarliest on y=1 is T=3.\n\nThen from y=1, I can go to y=2 at T=4, y=3 at T=5, y=4 at T=6, etc., up to y=8 at T=10, y=9 at T=11.\n\ny=4 at T=6, but T=6, y=4 is safe.\n\nBut y=8 at T=10.\n\nNow, could I be on y=8 earlier?\n\nFor example, if I go faster.\n\nFrom y=1 at T=3, to y=2 at T=4, y=3 at T=5, then to y=4 at T=6, but I could skip some or go faster? But I can only change by 1 per turn, so minimum one turn per row increase.\n\nFrom y=3 to y=4, must take one turn.\n\nSimilarly, cannot skip.\n\nUnless I stay on some row, but staying would delay.\n\nSo to go from y=1 to y=8, need at least 7 turns: at T=3 y=1, T=4 y=2, ..., T=10 y=8, that's 8 turns? T=3 to T=10 is 8 positions? From y=1 to y=8 is 7 steps, so from T=3 to T=10, that's 7 actions: from T=3 to T=10 is 7 turns later, but positions.\n\nAt turn T, y_T.\n\nIf at T=3, y=1.\n\nThen after k up moves, at turn T=3+k, y=1+k.\n\nTo reach y=8, 1+k=8, k=7, so at T=3+7=10, y=8.\n\nThen to y=9 at T=11.\n\nSo T=11 is the earliest possible to reach y=9, given that I must be on y=1 at T>=3.\n\nIs there another path?\n\nFor example, I could go to y=4 directly or something, but no, must go through y=1,2,3.\n\ny=1 must be at T>=3.\n\ny=2 and y=3 can be at any T except 2, but since I come from below, and T=2 is early, I will be after T=2 anyway.\n\nIn this case, with the waiting at start, I have T=11.\n\nBut perhaps I don't need to wait that long at start.\n\nAnother idea: I could go to y=1 later, but that might be worse.\n\nOr, I could move to a safe row and stay there to avoid the y=8 danger times, but in this case, I arrived after.\n\nBut let's see if I can reach earlier by not going straight.\n\nFor example, suppose at some point I go down to avoid danger, but that might not help.\n\nSpecifically for y=8, it is dangerous at T=6,7,8.\n\nIn my path, I am on y=8 at T=10, which is fine.\n\nBut if I could be on y=8 earlier, say at T=5 or something, but I can't because I start late.\n\nEarliest on y=1 is T=3, so earliest on y=8 is T=10, as above.\n\nPerhaps I can be on y=2 or y=3 earlier.\n\nBut y=2: I can be on y=2 at T=0? But at T=0, I am at y=0, not y=2.\n\nTo be on y=2, I need to have come from y=1 or y=3.\n\nEarliest I can be on y=1 is T=3, so earliest on y=2 is T=4.\n\nSimilarly, earliest on y=3 is T=5.\n\nThen y=4 at T=6, y=5 at T=7, y=6 at T=8, y=7 at T=9, y=8 at T=10, y=9 at T=11.\n\nNow, at T=6, I am on y=4, safe.\n\nBut y=8 dangerous at T=6,7,8, which I avoid since I am at y=8 at T=10.\n\nIf I were on y=8 at T=5, for example, but I can't because to be on y=8 at T=5, I need to be on y=7 or y=9 at T=4, etc., but from start, min time to y=8 is 8 turns, from y=0 to y=8 in 8 moves, at T=8.\n\nBut at T=8, if I am on y=8, it is dangerous, since y=8 dangerous at T=8.\n\nSimilarly, at T=7 or T=6, dangerous.\n\nSo I cannot be on y=8 at T=6,7,8.\n\nTherefore, the earliest I can be on y=8 is T=9 or later.\n\nBut T=9: if on y=8 at T=9, safe.\n\nHow to be on y=8 at T=9.\n\nThat means at T=9, y=8.\n\nThen I must have been at y=7 or y=8 or y=9 at T=8.\n\nIf at T=8, y=7, and a_8=U, then y_9=8.\n\nIf at T=8, y=8, and a_8=S, then y_9=8.\n\nBut at T=8, if y=8, dangerous, so I cannot be on y=8 at T=8.\n\nSimilarly, if at T=8, y=9, then a_8=D to y=8, but at T=8, if I am on y=9, safe, but to go to y=8, I choose D, but then at turn T=9, I am on y=8, but I need y_9=8.\n\nThe position at turn T is y_T.\n\nIf I want y_9=8, then at turn 9, on y=8.\n\nTo achieve that, from previous.\n\nAt T=8, I am at some position y_8.\n\nThen a_8 determines y_9.\n\nIf y_8=7, a_8=U, y_9=8.\n\nIf y_8=8, a_8=S, y_9=8.\n\nIf y_8=9, a_8=D, y_9=8.\n\nBut if y_8=8, at turn T=8, on y=8, dangerous, so not possible.\n\nSimilarly, y_8=9 is possible, but I need to be at y=9 earlier, which might not help.\n\nTo have y_9=8, I can come from y_8=7 with U, or from y_8=9 with D, but y_8=9 means I reached earlier, which requires more up moves.\n\nEasier to come from below.\n\nSo from y_8=7 with U.\n\nThen at T=9, y=8, which is safe since T=9>8.\n\nSimilarly, I need to be at y=7 at T=8.\n\ny=7 is safe except T=2, so at T=8, safe.\n\nNow, to be at y=7 at T=8.\n\nSimilarly, need to come from y=6 or y=8 or y=7, but y=8 dangerous at T=8, so better from y=6.\n\ny_8=7 can be from y_7=6 with U, or y_7=7 with S, or y_7=8 with D.\n\nBut y_7=8 at T=7 dangerous, so not possible.\n\ny_7=7 at T=7, but y=7 is safe at T=7? y=7 dangerous only at T=2, so at T=7, safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=6 always safe.\n\nSo possible: from y_7=6 with U to y_8=7.\n\nOr from y_7=7 with S to y_8=7.\n\nBut if I stay at y=7, it might delay.\n\nTo minimize, go up.\n\nNow, similarly, I need to reach y=7 at T=8 or something.\n\nBack to the beginning.\n\nI need to be on y=1 at T>=3.\n\nEarliest T=3.\n\nThen to y=2 at T=4, y=3 at T=5.\n\nNow, from y=3, I can go to y=4 at T=6, or stay, etc.\n\nBut to reach y=7 at T=8.\n\nAt T=5, y=3.\n\nThen T=6: if go U to y=4.\n\nT=7: U to y=5.\n\nT=8: U to y=6? Not to 7.\n\nAt T=8, if y=6, then to go to y=7 at T=9? But I want y=7 at T=8.\n\nFrom T=5 y=3.\n\nT=6: go U to y=4.\n\nT=7: U to y=5.\n\nT=8: U to y=6. So at T=8, y=6.\n\nThen to have y=7 at T=8, I need to be at y=7 at T=8, so I must have arrived earlier.\n\nBut from above, at T=5 y=3, min to y=7 is two steps: to y=4 at T=6, y=5 at T=7, y=6 at T=8, y=7 at T=9.\n\nCannot reach y=7 before T=7? At T=6, if y=4, can go to y=5, not directly to y=7.\n\nSo earliest at y=7 is T=7 if I go fast.\n\nBut at T=7, y=7 is safe, since only dangerous at T=2.\n\nNow, to be at y=8 at T=9.\n\nAt T=9, y=8.\n\nFrom above, at T=7, y=7 (if I reach).\n\nHow to reach y=7 at T=7.\n\nFrom start: at T=3 y=1, T=4 y=2, T=5 y=3, T=6 y=4, T=7 y=5? Not 7.\n\ny=1 at T=3, y=2 at T=4, y=3 at T=5, y=4 at T=6, y=5 at T=7, y=6 at T=8, y=7 at T=9.\n\nThen y=8 at T=10, y=9 at T=11.\n\nSame as before.\n\nTo have y=7 at T=7, I need to be at y=4 at T=4 or something.\n\nBut at T=4, I am at y=2, as before.\n\nUnless I can be on higher rows earlier, but I can't because of y=1 constraint.\n\nPerhaps I don't need to go through all rows sequentially if I stay, but that doesn't save time.\n\nAnother thought: I could go to y=4 directly from y=0, but no, must go through y=1,2,3.\n\ny=1 is a bottleneck.\n\nPerhaps I can be on y=2 at an earlier time by coming from above, but at start I am at y=0.\n\nFor example, at T=0, y=0, I go down? But cannot, y=0, min y=0.\n\nSo I must start from below.\n\nThus, earliest on y=1 is T=3, and then min to y=9 is 8 more steps, total T=11.\n\nBut let's confirm if I can be on y=1 at T=3 and go faster to y=9.\n\nSuppose at T=3, y=1.\n\nI go U to y=2 at T=4.\n\nThen at T=4, y=2, I could go U to y=3 at T=5.\n\nBut at T=5, y=3, safe.\n\nNow, instead of going directly, I could, but no benefit.\n\ny=4,5,6 safe, so no issue.\n\nNow, for y=7, at T=9 if I go straight.\n\nBut y=7 is safe at all T except 2.\n\nSimilarly, y=8, if I can be at T=9.\n\nAt T=9, y=8 safe.\n\nHow to be at y=8 at T=9.\n\nFrom above, at T=5 y=3, to y=8 at T=9, that's 4 steps: y=4 at T=6, y=5 at T=7, y=6 at T=8, y=7 at T=9? Not y=8.\n\ny=3 to y=8: need 5 steps, so at T=5 y=3, then y=4 T=6, y=5 T=7, y=6 T=8, y=7 T=9, y=8 T=10.\n\nSame as before.\n\nTo be at y=8 at T=9, I need to be at y=5 at T=5 or something.\n\nBut at T=5, I am at y=3.\n\nNot possible.\n\nTherefore, T=11 is the minimal.\n\nIn the sequence I have, at T=6, I am on y=4, which is safe.\n\nBut y=8 dangerous at T=6,7,8, but I am not on y=8 then.\n\nIn fact, at T=6, I am on y=4, T=7 on y=5, T=8 on y=6, all safe.\n\nThen T=9 on y=7, safe; T=10 on y=8, safe; T=11 on y=9.\n\nNow, the actions: from T=0 to T=10.\n\nActions:\n\nAt T=0: a_0 = S (since y=0, and cannot U)\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nTurn 0: position y=0, choose a_0=S, so y_1=0\n\nTurn 1: position y=0, choose a_1=S, y_2=0\n\nTurn 2: position y=0, choose a_2=U, y_3=1\n\nTurn 3: position y=1, choose a_3=U, y_4=2\n\nTurn 4: position y=2, choose a_4=U, y_5=3\n\nTurn 5: position y=3, choose a_5=U, y_6=4\n\nTurn 6: position y=4, choose a_6=U, y_7=5\n\nTurn 7: position y=5, choose a_7=U, y_8=6\n\nTurn 8: position y=6, choose a_8=U, y_9=7\n\nTurn 9: position y=7, choose a_9=U, y_10=8\n\nTurn 10: position y=8, choose a_10=U, y_11=9\n\nNow, at turn 11, y=9, reached.\n\nNumber of actions: from turn 0 to 10, that's 11 actions.\n\nH is the number of actions? The sequence is from t=0 to H-1, so for H actions.\n\nAfter H actions, position at turn H.\n\nIn this case, after 11 actions, at turn 11, y=9.\n\nBut is there a shorter path?\n\nSuppose I go to y=1 at T=3, but then from there, I go directly to y=4 or something, but I have to go through y=2 and y=3.\n\nUnless I can move multiple steps, but no, one step per turn.\n\nPerhaps I can avoid y=2 or y=3 at certain times, but in this case, they are safe after T=2.\n\nAnother idea: what if at some point I stay on a row to let time pass for y=8.\n\nBut in this case, since I arrive late, it's fine.\n\nFor example, suppose I go faster to y=6 or something.\n\nBut y=6 is always safe, so I can be there early.\n\nBut to get there, I need to pass through lower rows.\n\nEarliest at y=3 is T=5, then y=4 T=6, y=5 T=7, y=6 T=8.\n\nThen at T=8, I am on y=6, which is safe.\n\nNow, I need to go to y=7.\n\ny=7 safe at T=8, so I can go U at T=8 to y=9? No, to y=7.\n\ny_9=7 if a_8=U from y_8=6.\n\nThen at T=9, y=7.\n\nBut I can go to y=8 at T=10, same as before.\n\nIf I go to y=7 at T=8, then to y=8 at T=9.\n\nAt T=9, y=8, which is safe since T=9>8.\n\nThen to y=9 at T=10.\n\nT=10 y=9.\n\nBut to be at y=7 at T=8.\n\nHow? From above: if at T=5 y=3, T=6 y=4, T=7 y=5, T=8 y=6, not y=7.\n\nTo be at y=7 at T=8, need y_8=7.\n\nThat requires at T=7, y_7=6 or 7 or 8.\n\nIf y_7=6, a_7=U, y_8=7.\n\ny_7=6 at T=7.\n\nNow, from start, to be at y=6 at T=7.\n\ny=6 always safe.\n\nBut to reach y=6 at T=7.\n\nNeed to come from below.\n\nEarliest on y=1 at T=3.\n\nThen y=2 at T=4, y=3 at T=5, y=4 at T=6, y=5 at T=7? Not y=6.\n\ny=1 T=3, y=2 T=4, y=3 T=5, y=4 T=6, y=5 T=7, y=6 T=8.\n\nCannot reach y=6 before T=8 if starting from y=1 at T=3.\n\nThus, cannot be on y=7 at T=8; earliest at T=9.\n\nSimilarly, y=8 at T=10, y=9 at T=11.\n\nSo T=11 is minimal.\n\nNow, in the sequence, I have actions.\n\nBut in the output, I need to list the actions from turn t_1=0.\n\nThe sequence: for turn 0: a_0 = S\n\nTurn 1: a_1 = S\n\nTurn 2: a_2 = U\n\nTurn 3: a_3 = U\n\nTurn 4: a_4 = U\n\nTurn 5: a_5 = U\n\nTurn 6: a_6 = U\n\nTurn 7: a_7 = U\n\nTurn 8: a_8 = U\n\nTurn 9: a_9 = U\n\nTurn 10: a_10 = U\n\nAnd I reach y_11=9 at turn 11.\n\nBut H is the number of actions, so H=11.\n\nThe sequence is from t=0 to H-1, so for H=11, t=0 to 10.\n\nIn the answer, it should be listed as:\n\nTurn 0: S\n\nTurn 1: S\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nBut in the box.\n\nNow, I think I missed something.\n\nIn the car states, for freeway 8, there is a car that is dangerous at T=6,7,8, but in my path, at T=6, I am on y=4, not y=8; T=7 on y=5, etc., so fine.\n\nBut let me double-check if at any point I have collision.\n\nAt T=0: y=0, safe.\n\nT=1: y=0, safe.\n\nT=2: y=0, safe.\n\nT=3: y=1, row y=1 at T=3: safe, as we said.\n\nT=4: y=2, row y=2 at T=4: dangerous only at T=2, so safe.\n\nT=5: y=3, row y=3 at T=5: dangerous only at T=2, safe.\n\nT=6: y=4, row y=4: always safe.\n\nT=7: y=5, always safe.\n\nT=8: y=6, always safe.\n\nT=9: y=7, row y=7 at T=9: dangerous only at T=2, safe.\n\nT=10: y=8, row y=8 at T=10: dangerous at T=6,7,8, T=10>8, safe.\n\nT=11: y=9, safe.\n\nNo collisions.\n\nAnd minimal H=11.\n\nBut H=11 actions, from turn 0 to 10.\n\nPerhaps I can reduce by not staying at y=0, but I have to, because I cannot go to y=1 earlier.\n\nAnother path: suppose I go to y=1 at T=3, same.\n\nThen, after that, I could stay on some row to avoid the y=8 danger, but since I arrive after, no need.\n\nFor example, if I could be on y=8 at T=5, but impossible.\n\nSo I think it's minimal.\n\nBut let's see the car on y=1: at T=3, safe, yes.\n\nNow, the answer should be the sequence.\n\nIn the output format, it should be like:\n\nTurn 0: a_0\n\nTurn 1: a_1\n\netc.\n\nWith actions.\n\nIn my sequence, I have two S at start, then all U.\n\nNow, to write in the box.\n\nBut the initial position is (0,0), and I need to reach (0,9), which I do.\n\nPerhaps I can start by going down, but cannot, y=0.\n\nSo I think this is the way.\n\nBut in the car for freeway 1, there was a car at (0,-11,right,4), which at T=0 has head at 0, so at T=0, if on y=1, collision, but I am not.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, I think it's correct.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from \\((0, 0)\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) is 11. This requires 11 actions, from turn \\(t_1 = 0\\) to turn \\(t_1 + 10 = 10\\), reaching position \\(y = 9\\) at turn 11.\n\nThe sequence of actions is designed to:\n- Stay at \\(y = 0\\) for turns 0 and 1 to avoid being on \\(y = 1\\) at turns 1 and 2 (when \\(y = 1\\) is dangerous due to the car at \\((0, -11, \\text{right}, 4)\\)).\n- Move up continuously from turn 2 onwards to reach \\(y = 9\\) as quickly as possible, avoiding dangerous times on other freeways:\n  - \\(y = 2\\), \\(y = 3\\), and \\(y = 7\\) are dangerous only at turn 2, which is avoided by being on these rows after turn 2.\n  - \\(y = 8\\) is dangerous at turns 6, 7, and 8, which is avoided by being on \\(y = 8\\) at turn 10 (after the danger period).\n  - \\(y = 4\\), \\(y = 5\\), and \\(y = 6\\) are always safe.\n\nThe action sequence is:\n\n- At turn 0: Stay (\\(S\\)) to remain at \\(y = 0\\).\n- At turn 1: Stay (\\(S\\)) to remain at \\(y = 0\\).\n- At turn 2: Move up (\\(U\\)) to \\(y = 1\\).\n- At turn 3: Move up (\\(U\\)) to \\(y = 2\\).\n- At turn 4: Move up (\\(U\\)) to \\(y = 3\\).\n- At turn 5: Move up (\\(U\\)) to \\(y = 4\\).\n- At turn 6: Move up (\\(U\\)) to \\(y = 5\\).\n- At turn 7: Move up (\\(U\\)) to \\(y = 6\\).\n- At turn 8: Move up (\\(U\\)) to \\(y = 7\\).\n- At turn 9: Move up (\\(U\\)) to \\(y = 8\\).\n- At turn 10: Move up (\\(U\\)) to \\(y = 9\\).\n\nThis sequence ensures no collisions and reaches \\(y = 9\\) in the minimal number of turns.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 0: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 1: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 2: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 3: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 4: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 5: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: \\text{ U} \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t_1 = 1, and the player is at (0,0). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on freeways 1 to 8.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S). The vertical movement is constrained between 0 and 9.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T only if the player is on a freeway y (which is between 1 and 8) and at that turn T, there is a car on that freeway such that the car's span (which moves with time) contains the x-coordinate 0 (since the player is at (0, y)).\n\nImportant: When moving from y to y' at turn T, note:\n- At turn T, the player is on row y (the starting row of the turn) and then moves to row y' for the next turn.\n- Therefore, at turn T, we only check the freeway corresponding to the row we are on at the beginning of the turn (which is y) for collision.\n\nHowever, note the condition: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T\", where y_T is the row at turn T. And note that the row at turn T is the row at the beginning of the turn.\n\nAlso note: when we take an action at turn T, we move to the next row at the beginning of turn T+1. So at turn T, we are at row y_T, and then we move to y_{T+1} = y_T + delta.\n\nThus, the collision check at turn T is only for the freeway of row y_T.\n\nWe are given the car states at turn t_1 (which is turn 1). For each car, we know:\n  (head, tail, direction, speed)\n\nBut note the representation for left and right:\n- Left-moving: the car moves to the left. The span at time t_1 is [h, τ] (with h being the head and τ the tail). Then at time T, it becomes [h - s*(T-t_1), τ - s*(T-t_1)].\n- Right-moving: the car moves to the right. The span at time t_1 is [τ, h] (so τ is the tail and h is the head) and becomes [τ + s*(T-t_1), h + s*(T-t_1)].\n\nBut note: the problem states for left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] -> becomes [h - s*(T-t_1), τ - s*(T-t_1)]\nand for right-moving: Span(t_1) = [τ, h] -> becomes [τ + s*(T-t_1), h + s*(T-t_1)]\n\nHowever, the representation in the table is given as (head, tail, direction, speed). So we must interpret:\n\nFor a right-moving car: the head is the rightmost end? and the tail is the leftmost? But the problem says for right-moving: the span is [τ, h] meaning from tail to head (increasing). So in the table, for a right-moving car, the head is the larger coordinate and the tail the smaller.\n\nSimilarly, for a left-moving car: the head is the leftmost? and the tail the rightmost? because the span is [h, τ] meaning from head to tail (decreasing). But note: the representation [h, τ] for left-moving: if h is the head (left end) and τ is the tail (right end), then h <= τ? Actually, no: because the car is moving left, so the head (front) is at a smaller coordinate? \n\nWait, the problem does not specify the coordinate system. But we can deduce from the update.\n\nLet me clarify with an example: \nFor a left-moving car: at time t_1, the car's head is at h and tail at τ. Then at time T, the head becomes h - s*(T-t_1) and the tail becomes τ - s*(T-t_1). This implies that the car is moving to the left (decreasing x). Therefore, the head (the front) must be at a smaller x than the tail? That would be unusual.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might define the head and tail regardless of direction? But the update rules depend on direction.\n\nActually, the problem states for left-moving: \n  Span(t_1) = [h, τ] \nand then at T: [h - s*(T-t_1), τ - s*(T-t_1)]\n\nBut if the car is moving left, then the entire car shifts left. So if at t_1 the head (front) is at h, then after moving left by s*(T-t_1), the head becomes h - s*(T-t_1). The tail (the back) would be at τ, and then becomes τ - s*(T-t_1). \n\nBut note: for a left-moving car, the head should be the leftmost point? So if the car is moving left, the front is the left end. Therefore, the head h should be less than the tail τ? \n\nSimilarly, for a right-moving car: the head is the rightmost point? Then the head h is greater than the tail τ? \n\nLooking at the update for right: \n  [τ, h] becomes [τ + s*(T-t_1), h + s*(T-t_1)]\nso the entire car moves right. Then the tail (left end) τ becomes τ + s*(T-t_1) and the head (right end) h becomes h + s*(T-t_1). So yes, h > τ.\n\nTherefore, in the data:\n  For a right-moving car: head > tail\n  For a left-moving car: head < tail? But wait, the problem writes for left-moving: [h, τ] and then subtracts. So if the car moves left, the head (which is the front) is at a smaller x than the tail? That would mean the car is oriented from head to tail in the negative direction? \n\nAlternatively, the problem might have defined the head and tail without regard to direction? But the update rule uses the same notation for both.\n\nI think we must interpret the given numbers as they are and apply the update rules.\n\nGiven the data:\n\nFreeway 1: \n  (52,41,right,4) -> this is right-moving: head=52, tail=41? But wait, 52>41, so that matches: head>tail for right.\n  (4,-7,right,4) -> head=4, tail=-7: 4>-7, so head>tail -> right.\n\nFreeway 2:\n  (24,47,left,24) -> head=24, tail=47: 24<47 -> left.\n\nFreeway 3:\n  (-12,-47,right,36) -> head=-12, tail=-47: -12>-47 -> right.\n\nFreeway 4,5,6: \n  (60,49,right,12) -> head=60>tail=49 -> right.\n\nFreeway 7:\n  (-12,-47,right,36) -> same as freeway 3.\n\nFreeway 8:\n  (52,41,right,4), (16,5,right,4), (-20,-31,right,4) -> all right: head>tail.\n\nSo for left-moving: only freeway 2 has one car: (24,47,left,24). This car: head=24, tail=47. So the initial span at t_1=1 is [24,47]? But wait, the problem says for left-moving: the span is [h, τ] = [24,47]. However, if the car is moving left, then the update is [24 - s*(T-1), 47 - s*(T-1)]. But note: the span [24,47] is from 24 to 47, which is increasing? But the problem writes [h,τ] and then subtracts. \n\nBut the collision condition is: we check if 0 is in the interval [h - s*(T-1), τ - s*(T-1)]. However, if h < τ, then the interval [h - s*(T-1), τ - s*(T-1)] is still increasing? Actually, the interval is always from the lower bound to the upper bound? \n\nBut note: the update for left-moving: [h - s*(T-1), τ - s*(T-1)] might become [a, b] with a < b? because h < τ implies h-s*(T-1) < τ-s*(T-1). So the interval is [min, max] = [h - s*(T-1), τ - s*(T-1)]? \n\nHowever, the problem does not specify the order of the endpoints. But the collision condition is 0 in the span, which is a continuous interval. So we can represent the span as the closed interval between the two endpoints, regardless of which is larger? Actually, the update rules do not change the relative order: \n  For left: h < τ -> then h - s*(T-1) < τ - s*(T-1)\n  For right: τ < h -> then τ + s*(T-1) < h + s*(T-1)\n\nSo the span is always [min, max] for both? \n\nTherefore, we can compute for any car at time T (relative to t_1=1) the span as:\n  If right: [τ + s*(T-1), h + s*(T-1)]\n  If left: [h - s*(T-1), τ - s*(T-1)]   [and note that since h<τ, the interval is [h - s*(T-1), τ - s*(T-1)] and it is increasing]\n\nBut wait: for left, the problem writes [h, τ] and then [h - s*(T-1), τ - s*(T-1)]. If originally h < τ, then the interval at T is [h - s*(T-1), τ - s*(T-1)] and since h-... < τ-... , it is increasing.\n\nSo we can compute the interval for any car at time T as:\n  right: [tail + s*(T-1), head + s*(T-1)]\n  left: [head - s*(T-1), tail - s*(T-1)]\n\nBut note: in the data for left, we are given (head, tail) = (24,47) and direction left. So we use:\n  left: [24 - 24*(T-1), 47 - 24*(T-1)]\n\nSimilarly, for right: given (head, tail) for right: we use [tail + s*(T-1), head + s*(T-1)]\n\nHowever, the problem states for right: the span at t_1 is [τ, h] and then becomes [τ + s*(T-1), h + s*(T-1)]. So we need to know τ and h. In the data, the tuple is (head, tail). For right, the head is the right end and tail is the left end? Then the span at t_1 is [tail, head]? \n\nYes, so for a right car: the span at t_1 is [tail, head] (because tail is the left end, head the right end). Then at T: [tail + s*(T-1), head + s*(T-1)].\n\nSimilarly, for left: the span at t_1 is [head, tail]? But note the problem writes [h, τ]. And then at T: [h - s*(T-1), τ - s*(T-1)]. However, if the head is the left end (for a left-moving car) and tail is the right end, then the span at t_1 is [head, tail]? But that would be [24,47] for freeway2. But 24<47, so the interval [24,47] is increasing? But a car moving left should have its head (front) at 24 and tail at 47? That would be a car that extends from 24 to 47? Then when it moves left, the entire segment moves left.\n\nSo the representation is consistent.\n\nTherefore, for each car, we have:\n  If direction is 'right': \n      low(T) = tail + s*(T-1)\n      high(T) = head + s*(T-1)\n  If direction is 'left':\n      low(T) = head - s*(T-1)\n      high(T) = tail - s*(T-1)\n\nAnd we require that at turn T, if the player is on freeway k (at row k, which is between 1 and 8) then for every car on freeway k, 0 must not be in [low(T), high(T)].\n\nNote: the player is at (0, y) so we check the x-coordinate 0.\n\nWe start at turn 1 at (0,0). We are not on any freeway (since freeways are y=1..8) so no collision at turn 1.\n\nWe need to get to (0,9). The minimal number of turns is at least 9 (if we only move up) but we might have to wait because of cars.\n\nWe are going to simulate the moves. We are to find the minimal H and the sequence.\n\nWe can use BFS (breadth-first search) over states (turn, y) but note the turn can be large? However, the cars move linearly and we are only concerned with when the car spans cover 0. Since the cars move continuously, we can compute the intervals at any turn.\n\nBut note: the turns are discrete. We start at turn 1, then turn 2, etc.\n\nWe are to minimize H (the number of turns from the current sequence: from turn 1 to turn 1+H-1). The player starts at (0,0) at turn 1. Then at turn 1 we choose an action, and at the beginning of turn 2 we are at the new y.\n\nSo the state: (turn, y) at the beginning of the turn.\n\nWe start at state (1,0). We want to reach (T,9) for some T.\n\nThe actions: at turn t (state t,y), we choose a in {U, D, S}. Then:\n  if a=U: next y = min(9, y+1)\n  if a=D: next y = max(0, y-1)\n  if a=S: next y = y\n\nBut note: we must check for collision at the current turn: at turn t, we are at y. If y is between 1 and 8, then we check the cars on freeway y at turn t.\n\nIf there is a car on freeway y at turn t such that 0 is in the car's span at turn t, then collision -> invalid.\n\nWe are given the cars at turn 1. We can compute for any turn t (>=1) the car's span.\n\nWe are going to do a BFS (or Dijkstra since we want minimal turns, and each action takes one turn) over the state (t, y). But note: the turn t can be large? However, we can bound the time? \n\nBut note: the cars move arbitrarily? We have to avoid the collisions. The minimal H is at least 8 (because we start at 0 and need to get to 9, and we can move at most one per turn). But we might have to wait (by staying or moving down) to avoid collisions.\n\nWe can set a bound: since the minimal H is 8, but we might have to wait. Let us consider the worst-case: we might have to wait until a car passes. The cars move at constant speeds. The critical time for a car on a freeway is when its span covers 0.\n\nWe can precompute for each freeway and each car the time intervals (if any) during which the car covers 0.\n\nBut note: the car spans are continuous and moving. For a given car, we can solve for when 0 is in [low(t), high(t)].\n\nFor a right car: \n  0 in [tail + s*(t-1), head + s*(t-1)] \n  => tail + s*(t-1) <= 0 <= head + s*(t-1)\n  => t-1 >= -tail/s   and t-1 <= -head/s? \n\nWait, let me do the inequalities:\n\n  tail + s*(t-1) <= 0  => t-1 <= -tail/s   [if s>0] -> but note: tail could be negative.\n\nActually, we have:\n  tail + s*(t-1) <= 0 <= head + s*(t-1)\n\nSo:\n  0 <= head + s*(t-1)  => t-1 >= -head/s\n  0 >= tail + s*(t-1)  => t-1 >= -tail/s   ??? \n\nWait: \n  tail + s*(t-1) <= 0  => s*(t-1) <= -tail  => t-1 >= ceil(-tail/s) ? But we are in real numbers? Actually, the turn t is integer.\n\nBut note: the inequalities:\n\n  tail + s*(t-1) <= 0   => t-1 <= (-tail)/s   [if s>0, then we can divide and the inequality remains?]\n\nBut let's rearrange:\n\n  tail + s*(t-1) <= 0   => s*(t-1) <= -tail   => t-1 <= ceil(-tail/s) ? But we are dealing with integers? Actually, the positions are integers? The problem doesn't specify, but the grid is 2D and the positions are integers? The cars are given with integer coordinates.\n\nBut note: the update: the car moves by s per turn, and s is integer? Yes, the speeds are integers.\n\nTherefore, the positions at integer turns are integers.\n\nSo for a right car:\n  We require:\n      tail + s*(t-1) <= 0 <= head + s*(t-1)\n\n  This can be written as:\n      t-1 >= ceil( ( -head ) / s )? \n\nActually, we can solve:\n\n  Let t0 = t-1 (so relative to turn 1, we are at time offset t0 = t-1).\n\n  Then:\n      tail + s*t0 <= 0  => t0 <= (-tail) / s   [if s>0, then division by positive, so inequality remains]\n      head + s*t0 >= 0  => t0 >= ceil( (-head) / s )? \n\nBut note: the inequalities are inclusive. We can write:\n\n  t0_min = ceil( (-head) / s )   [because head+s*t0>=0 => t0>= (-head)/s, and since t0 integer, t0>=ceil((-head)/s) ]\n  t0_max = floor( (-tail) / s )   [because tail+s*t0<=0 => t0<= (-tail)/s, and t0 integer -> t0<=floor((-tail)/s)]\n\nBut wait: \n  tail + s*t0 <= 0 -> s*t0 <= -tail -> t0 <= (-tail)/s -> then the maximum integer t0 is floor( (-tail)/s )? \n\nBut if (-tail)/s is integer, then t0 can be that integer. So:\n\n  t0_min = ceil( (-head) / s ) \n  t0_max = floor( (-tail) / s )\n\nBut note: we have the condition that the interval is non-empty: t0_min <= t0_max.\n\nSimilarly, for a left car:\n  We require 0 in [head - s*t0, tail - s*t0] \n  => head - s*t0 <= 0 <= tail - s*t0\n  => \n      0 >= head - s*t0  => s*t0 >= head  => t0 >= ceil(head/s)\n      0 <= tail - s*t0  => s*t0 <= tail  => t0 <= floor(tail/s)\n\nSo for left car: \n  t0_min = ceil(head/s)\n  t0_max = floor(tail/s)\n\nThen the car blocks the freeway at time t (which is t0+1) for t0 in [t0_min, t0_max].\n\nBut note: if the car moves continuously, then at integer times, we check the entire interval? And the collision occurs if at time t (which is turn t) the 0 is in the interval? So if the interval [low, high] covers 0, then collision.\n\nTherefore, for each freeway, we can precompute the set of turns t (>=1) for which there is at least one car that covers 0.\n\nHowever, note: the freeway might have multiple cars. We only need one car to cover 0 to cause a collision.\n\nSo for freeway k, we compute the set S_k of turns t such that at least one car on freeway k at turn t has 0 in its span.\n\nThen when the player is at (t, y) and y=k (a freeway between 1 and 8) then we must have t not in S_k.\n\nWe are going to precompute these sets for each freeway.\n\nBut note: the turns t are relative to the initial turn 1. We are only concerned with turns from 1 up to a bound. We can set a bound for H: the minimal H is at least 8. But we might need to wait, so we can set a bound, say 100 turns? But that might be too big. Alternatively, we can note that the cars move at constant speeds and eventually the dangerous intervals are finite. For each car, the blocking interval is finite? \n\nFor example, a right car: it blocks for t0 in [ceil((-head)/s), floor((-tail)/s)]. Since head and tail are fixed, and s>0, then as t0 increases, the car moves to the right and eventually the entire car is at positive x? Then it will never block again. Similarly, for a left car, eventually the car moves to the left and becomes negative? \n\nBut note: we have both positive and negative speeds? Actually, the direction is given, and the speed is positive. The update uses s as a positive magnitude.\n\nTherefore, the blocking intervals are finite. We can compute the set S_k for each freeway.\n\nAlternatively, we can avoid precomputation and during BFS we check the current turn t for the freeway we are on.\n\nBut we must be efficient. Since the minimal H is at least 8 and we don't expect too many waiting steps, we can set a bound for the total turns, say 100.\n\nNow, let's compute for each freeway the dangerous turns.\n\nWe'll denote t0 = t-1, so t = t0+1.\n\nFreeway 1: two cars (both right)\n  car1: head=52, tail=41, s=4, direction=right\n      t0_min = ceil( (-52)/4 ) = ceil(-13) = -13 -> but t0>=0? Actually, t0 = t-1, and t>=1 so t0>=0.\n          We are only concerned with t0>=0.\n      t0_min = max(0, ceil(-52/4)) = max(0, -13) = 0? \n          But note: ceil(-13) = -13 -> but we are only considering t0>=0, so we take the max with 0.\n      Actually, we require t0_min = ceil( (-head)/s ) = ceil(-52/4) = ceil(-13) = -13 -> but then the condition t0>=ceil(-52/4) is always true for t0>=0? \n      Then t0_max = floor( (-tail)/s ) = floor(-41/4) = floor(-10.25) = -11 -> but this is negative? \n\nWait, let me recast: \n  The condition: \n      tail + s*t0 <= 0   => 41 + 4*t0 <= 0 -> 4*t0 <= -41 -> t0 <= -41/4 = -10.25 -> so t0 <= -11? -> but t0>=0, so no solution? \n\n  and \n      head + s*t0 >= 0   -> 52 + 4*t0 >=0 -> t0>=-13 -> always true for t0>=0.\n\nSo the car1 does not block at any t0>=0? Because the entire car is at positive x at t0=0? \n\nSimilarly, car2: (4,-7,right,4)\n  Condition:\n      tail = -7, head=4, s=4.\n      tail + s*t0 <=0 -> -7+4*t0<=0 -> 4*t0<=7 -> t0<=1.75 -> so t0<=1 (since integer)\n      head + s*t0>=0 -> 4+4*t0>=0 -> always true for t0>=0.\n\n  And we require both? So for t0=0: \n      tail=-7, head=4 -> at t0=0: span = [-7,4] -> 0 is in [-7,4] -> so at t0=0 (which is turn t=1) it blocks? But we are at turn 1? \n\nBut note: at turn 1, the player is at (0,0). We are not on freeway 1 (which is y=1). So we don't check freeway 1 at turn 1.\n\nHowever, if the player is at freeway 1 at turn t, then we check. \n\nSo for freeway 1, car2: blocks for t0 in [0,1]? \n  t0=0: turn t=1: [-7,4] -> 0 in [ -7,4] -> yes.\n  t0=1: turn t=2: [-7+4, 4+4] = [-3,8] -> 0 in [-3,8] -> yes.\n  t0=2: [-7+8,4+8]=[1,12] -> 0 not in [1,12] -> no.\n\nSo car2 blocks at turn 1 and 2? \n\nBut wait: the condition for car2: \n  t0_min = ceil( (-head)/s ) = ceil(-4/4)=ceil(-1)=-1 -> but we consider t0>=0, so the condition for the head is satisfied for all t0>=0? \n  t0_max = floor( (-tail)/s ) = floor(7/4)=floor(1.75)=1.\n\nSo the car2 blocks for t0 in [0,1] -> turns 1 and 2.\n\nBut note: the other car1: we found it doesn't block? \n  car1: at t0=0: tail=41, head=52 -> [41,52] -> 0 not in -> so no.\n  at t0=1: [41+4,52+4]=[45,56] -> no.\n\nSo freeway 1 is blocked at turns 1 and 2.\n\nBut wait: the freeway has two cars. We have to check each car. So freeway1: \n  at turn1: car2 blocks -> so freeway1 is blocked at turn1.\n  at turn2: car2 blocks -> blocked at turn2.\n  at turn3: car2: [1,12] -> 0 not in -> and car1: [45,56] -> no. So freeway1 is safe at turn3 and beyond.\n\nNow freeway2: one car (24,47,left,24)\n  left car: \n      t0_min = ceil(head/s) = ceil(24/24)=ceil(1)=1\n      t0_max = floor(tail/s)=floor(47/24)=floor(1.958)=1\n  So only at t0=1 -> turn t=2.\n\n  Check: \n    at t0=1: \n        low = head - s*t0 = 24 - 24*1 = 0\n        high = tail - s*t0 = 47 - 24 = 23\n        span = [0,23] -> 0 is in? yes (at the boundary).\n\n  So freeway2 is blocked at turn2.\n\n  Also, at t0=0: \n        [24,47] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\n  at t0=2: [24-48,47-48]=[-24,-1] -> 0 not in.\n\n  So freeway2 is blocked only at turn2.\n\nFreeway3: (-12,-47,right,36)\n  right car: \n      head=-12, tail=-47, s=36\n      Condition:\n          tail + s*t0 <=0 -> -47+36*t0<=0 -> 36*t0<=47 -> t0<=47/36≈1.305 -> t0<=1\n          head + s*t0>=0 -> -12+36*t0>=0 -> t0>=12/36=1/3 -> t0>=ceil(1/3)=1? (since t0 integer, then t0>=1)\n\n      So t0 in [1,1] -> t0=1 -> turn t=2.\n\n      Check at t0=0: span=[-47,-12] -> 0 not in.\n      t0=1: [-47+36, -12+36] = [-11,24] -> 0 in [-11,24] -> yes.\n\n      So freeway3 blocked at turn2.\n\nFreeway4: (60,49,right,12) -> note: head=60, tail=49? \n  Condition: \n      tail + s*t0 <=0 -> 49+12*t0<=0 -> 12*t0<=-49 -> impossible? because t0>=0 -> no solution.\n\n  So never blocks.\n\nSimilarly, freeway5: same as 4 -> never blocks.\n\nFreeway6: same as 4 -> never blocks.\n\nFreeway7: same as freeway3: (-12,-47,right,36) -> blocks at turn2.\n\nFreeway8: three cars, all right, speed=4.\n  car1: (52,41,right,4) -> same as freeway1 car1: never blocks? \n  car2: (16,5,right,4)\n        Condition: \n            tail=5, head=16, s=4.\n            tail+s*t0<=0 -> 5+4*t0<=0 -> 4*t0<=-5 -> impossible? -> never blocks? \n        But check: at t0=0: [5,16] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n        at t0=1: [9,20] -> safe.\n        at t0=2: [13,24] -> safe.\n\n  car3: (-20,-31,right,4)\n        Condition:\n            tail=-31, head=-20, s=4.\n            tail+s*t0<=0 -> -31+4*t0<=0 -> 4*t0<=31 -> t0<=7.75 -> t0<=7\n            head+s*t0>=0 -> -20+4*t0>=0 -> t0>=5\n        So t0 in [5,7] -> turns t=6,7,8.\n\n        Check:\n          t0=5: [-31+20, -20+20] = [-11,0] -> 0 in? yes (at the boundary).\n          t0=6: [-31+24, -20+24] = [-7,4] -> 0 in.\n          t0=7: [-31+28, -20+28] = [-3,8] -> 0 in.\n          t0=8: [1,12] -> not in.\n\n        So freeway8 is blocked at turns 6,7,8.\n\nBut note: freeway8 has multiple cars. The car3 blocks at turns 6,7,8. The others don't block. So freeway8 is blocked at turns 6,7,8.\n\nSummary of dangerous turns for freeways:\n\nFreeway1: turns 1,2\nFreeway2: turn 2\nFreeway3: turn 2\nFreeway4: never\nFreeway5: never\nFreeway6: never\nFreeway7: turn 2\nFreeway8: turns 6,7,8\n\nNow, we plan the moves. We start at turn1, y=0.\n\nWe want to get to y=9. The minimal number of turns is 8 (if we move up every turn: 0->1->2->...->9). But we have to avoid the freeways when they are blocked.\n\nLet's try:\n\nTurn1: at (0,0). We choose an action. We can go up to 1, or stay at 0, or down to 0 (but we are at 0, so down stays at 0).\n\nBut at turn1: we are at y=0 (not a freeway) -> safe.\n\nIf we go up: then at the beginning of turn2, we are at y=1.\n\nAt turn2: we are at y=1 -> freeway1. But freeway1 is blocked at turn2 -> collision. So we cannot be at freeway1 at turn2.\n\nTherefore, we cannot go up at turn1.\n\nWe must either stay or go down? But going down at y=0: we stay at 0.\n\nSo turn1: we choose S (or D, but D also stays at 0). Then at turn2, we are still at y=0.\n\nNow turn2: we are at y=0 (safe). Then we can choose an action.\n\nBut we want to minimize H, so we prefer to move up when safe.\n\nAt turn2: if we go up, then at the beginning of turn3 we are at y=1.\n\nAt turn3: freeway1. We computed freeway1 is blocked at turn1 and 2, but safe at turn3 and beyond. So at turn3, freeway1 is safe.\n\nThen we can proceed.\n\nSo plan:\n\nTurn1: S (stay at 0) -> safe (at freeway0, no collision)\nTurn2: U -> move to y=1 at the beginning of turn3.\n\nAt turn3: we are at y=1 -> freeway1. Check: freeway1 is safe at turn3. Then we can choose to move up again to y=2 at the beginning of turn4.\n\nBut at turn4: we are at y=2 -> freeway2. Now, freeway2: we computed it is blocked only at turn2. At turn4: safe.\n\nThen we can go to y=3 at turn5.\n\nAt turn5: freeway3 -> blocked only at turn2, so safe.\n\nThen to y=4 at turn6.\n\nAt turn6: freeway4 -> safe (never blocked).\n\nBut then we have freeway8 at y=8: blocked at turns 6,7,8. So if we are at y=8 at turn6, then we are blocked.\n\nWe are at turn6: we are at y=4. We have to go from 4 to 8: that takes 4 moves. So:\n\nTurn6: at y=4 -> move to y=5 at turn7.\nTurn7: at y=5 -> move to y=6 at turn8.\nTurn8: at y=6 -> move to y=7 at turn9.\nTurn9: at y=7 -> move to y=8 at turn10.\n\nBut at turn10: we are at y=8. Then we check: freeway8 is blocked at turns 6,7,8 -> safe at turn10? yes. Then we can move to y=9 at turn11.\n\nBut wait: we are at turn10: we are at y=8. Then we choose an action to move to y=9 at turn11. And we are done at turn11? But the goal is to be at (0,9) at the beginning of turn t_1+H-1. So at the beginning of turn11, we are at y=9? \n\nActually, we are at the beginning of turn10 at y=8. Then we choose U: at the beginning of turn11, we are at y=9. Then we stop? But we must be at (0,9) at the beginning of a turn? and then we are done. So we need H-1 = 10? because we start at turn1 and then we have 10 actions? \n\nBut note: the sequence is from t=1 to t=1+H-1. So the turns we act: turn1, turn2, ... turn1+H-1. Then the state at the beginning of turn1+H is (0,9). \n\nWe start at turn1: we are at (0,0). Then we take H actions: at turn1, turn2, ... up to turn1+H-1. Then at the beginning of turn1+H, we are at (0,9). So the minimal H is the number of actions.\n\nIn our plan:\n\nTurn1: S -> at turn2: (0,0)\nTurn2: U -> at turn3: (0,1)\nTurn3: U -> at turn4: (0,2)\nTurn4: U -> at turn5: (0,3)\nTurn5: U -> at turn6: (0,4)\nTurn6: U -> at turn7: (0,5)\nTurn7: U -> at turn8: (0,6)\nTurn8: U -> at turn9: (0,7)\nTurn9: U -> at turn10: (0,8)\nTurn10: U -> at turn11: (0,9)\n\nSo H=10.\n\nBut at turn10: we are at the beginning of turn10 at (0,8). Then we take action U at turn10: then at the beginning of turn11 we are at (0,9). So we need 10 actions? and H=10.\n\nBut note: at turn10: we are at freeway8? and freeway8 is blocked at turns 6,7,8 -> but turn10 is safe. So that's fine.\n\nHowever, we must check every turn when we are on a freeway.\n\nIn this plan, we are on freeway1 at turn3: safe (freeway1 blocked only at 1,2)\nfreeway2 at turn4: safe (blocked only at 2)\nfreeway3 at turn5: safe (blocked only at 2)\nfreeway4 at turn6: safe (never blocked)\nfreeway5 at turn7: safe (never blocked)\nfreeway6 at turn8: safe (never blocked)\nfreeway7 at turn9: safe (blocked only at 2? yes, freeway7 blocked only at turn2)\nfreeway8 at turn10: safe (blocked only at 6,7,8)\n\nSo the entire plan is safe.\n\nBut can we do better? We waited one turn at the beginning. Is there a plan with H=9?\n\nWe must start at turn1 at y=0. Then we have 9 actions to get to y=9. That would require 9 moves: but we start at 0 and need to get to 9: that requires 9 moves? Because each move up only increases by 1. So we must have at least 9 moves? \n\nBut note: we can move down? but that would require even more moves. So the minimal H is 9? \n\nWait: we start at (0,0) at turn1. Then we take 9 actions: \n  After 9 actions, we are at the beginning of turn10. We require that at the beginning of turn10, we are at y=9.\n\nBut to get from 0 to 9, we need 9 moves up. So we must have 9 U's. But we must avoid collisions.\n\nThe only way to have H=9 is to use 9 consecutive U's? \n\nBut at turn1: if we go up to y=1 at turn2, then at turn2 we are at y=1 and freeway1 is blocked at turn2 -> collision.\n\nSo we cannot start with U at turn1.\n\nIs there a way to avoid waiting? \n\nWe could try to go up at turn1 to y=1, but that causes collision at turn2. \n\nAlternatively, we might not go straight up. For example, we might go up and then down to avoid a freeway at a dangerous turn? But note: we must eventually go through each freeway.\n\nBut we have freeway8 blocked at turns 6,7,8. So we cannot be at freeway8 at turns 6,7,8. \n\nTo get to y=9, we must be at y=8 at some turn. Then we move to y=9. We want to avoid being at y=8 at turns 6,7,8.\n\nIn the minimal path (9 moves) we would be at freeway1 at turn2, freeway2 at turn3, freeway3 at turn4, freeway4 at turn5, freeway5 at turn6, freeway6 at turn7, freeway7 at turn8, freeway8 at turn9.\n\nBut:\n\nfreeway1 at turn2: blocked -> collision.\n\nSo we cannot have the minimal 9 moves.\n\nWe must wait at least one turn. So minimal H is 10.\n\nWe have a plan with H=10: \n  Actions: \n    turn1: S (or D, but same effect: stay at 0)\n    turn2: U -> to y=1 at turn3\n    turn3: U -> to y=2 at turn4\n    turn4: U -> to y=3 at turn5\n    turn5: U -> to y=4 at turn6\n    turn6: U -> to y=5 at turn7\n    turn7: U -> to y=6 at turn8\n    turn8: U -> to y=7 at turn9\n    turn9: U -> to y=8 at turn10\n    turn10: U -> to y=9 at turn11\n\nBut we must check freeway8 at turn10: which is safe.\n\nBut note: at turn9: we are at freeway7 (y=7) at turn9: freeway7 is blocked only at turn2 -> safe.\n\nAnd at turn10: freeway8 at turn10: safe.\n\nSo the plan is safe.\n\nBut wait: at turn6: we are at freeway4 (y=4) at turn6: safe (never blocked). \nturn7: freeway5 (y=5) at turn7: safe.\nturn8: freeway6 (y=6) at turn8: safe.\nturn9: freeway7 (y=7) at turn9: safe (only blocked at turn2).\n\nSo we are good.\n\nBut we could also consider: is there a way to avoid the freeway8 at turns 6,7,8 without waiting? We already are not there at those turns. Our plan hits freeway8 at turn10, which is safe.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 10.\n\nBut what about using down? We don't need to go down because we don't have to avoid any block in the lower freeways beyond turn2.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nTurn1: S\nTurn2: U\nTurn3: U\nTurn4: U\nTurn5: U\nTurn6: U\nTurn7: U\nTurn8: U\nTurn9: U\nTurn10: U\n\nBut note: at turn1, we could also choose D? But at y=0, D also stays at 0. So we can use D? However, the problem says: \n  D: if a_t = D, then y_{t+1} = max(0, y_t-1). So at y=0, D stays at 0.\n\nBut the problem says: \"each action a_t ∈ { U, D, S }\". So we can use either S or D for staying.\n\nBut to be consistent, we might use S for staying. \n\nThe problem does not specify preference for S vs D when staying at 0. But we'll use S.\n\nSo the answer:\n\nTurn t_1 (which is turn1): S\nTurn t_1+1 (turn2): U\nTurn t_1+2 (turn3): U\n...\nup to turn10: U\n\nBut note: the sequence is from t=0 to H-1? Actually, the problem says: \n  \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\"\n\nHere t_1=1, so the actions are for turns: 1, 2, ..., 1+H-1.\n\nWe have H=10, so actions for turns 1 to 10.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 1: S\nTurn 2: U\nTurn 3: U\nTurn 4: U\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\n\nBut wait, at turn10: we are at y=8 (at the beginning of turn10) and we move up to y=9 at the beginning of turn11. So we are done at turn11? and we have taken 10 actions.\n\nNow, we must write the answer in the box.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" and so on.\n\nSo:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 1: S\nTurn 2: U\nTurn 3: U\nTurn 4: U\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\n}\n\nBut let me double-check the freeway at turn10: freeway8. We computed freeway8 is blocked at turns 6,7,8. Turn10 is safe. \n\nHowever, we must be cautious: what if freeway8 has a car that we missed? \n\nFreeway8: \n  car3: (-20,-31,right,4) -> at turn10: t0 = t-1 = 9.\n      span = [tail+4*9, head+4*9] = [-31+36, -20+36] = [5,16] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\nThe other cars: \n  car1: (52,41,right,4) -> [41+36, 52+36] = [77,88] -> safe.\n  car2: (16,5,right,4) -> [5+36,16+36]=[41,52] -> safe.\n\nSo yes.\n\nBut note: at turn9: we are at freeway7: \n  freeway7: car (-12,-47,right,36) -> at turn9: t0=8.\n      span = [-47+36*8, -12+36*8] = [-47+288, -12+288] = [241,276] -> safe.\n\nAnd freeway6: at turn8: \n  freeway6: (60,49,right,12) -> at turn8: t0=7.\n      [49+12*7, 60+12*7] = [49+84,60+84]=[133,144] -> safe.\n\nSo all clear.\n\nBut is there a way to do it in 10 turns but with a different sequence? For example, could we have moved up at turn1 to freeway1 at turn2? but freeway1 is blocked at turn2 -> collision. So we must avoid that.\n\nAlternatively, we could wait more? But that would increase H.\n\nOr we could use a detour? For example, go up to freeway1 at turn3 (as we did) then at turn3 we are safe. But then we could wait at freeway1? but that would increase the total turns. We don't need to.\n\nTherefore, the above plan is minimal (H=10) and safe.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 1: S\nTurn 2: U\nTurn 3: U\nTurn 4: U\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\n}\n\nBut note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and we have H=10.\n\nHowever, we must be careful: the problem defines H as the number of turns in the sequence? The sequence has 10 actions, so H=10.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\", so the number of actions is H.\n\nAnd we have H=10.\n\nBut let me check: starting at (0,0) at turn1. Then:\n\nAfter action1 (turn1: S): at turn2: (0,0)\nAfter action2 (turn2: U): at turn3: (0,1)\n...\nAfter action10 (turn10: U): at turn11: (0,9)\n\nSo we reached (0,9) at the beginning of turn11. And we used 10 actions.\n\nIs there a plan with H=9? We argued that we need at least 9 moves up, but the first move up at turn1 leads to collision at turn2. So we must wait at least one turn. Therefore, H=10 is minimal.\n\nBut wait: what if we use a different route? For example, at some point we move down to avoid a freeway? But that would require more moves. \n\nFor instance, to avoid freeway8 at turns 6,7,8, we might wait at freeway7 for a few turns? But then we would be at freeway7 at turn8: freeway7 is safe. Then at turn9: we move to freeway8 -> but freeway8 at turn9: we computed freeway8 is blocked at turns 6,7,8 -> turn9: is it blocked? \n\nWe computed freeway8: car3: blocks at turns 6,7,8 (which are t0=5,6,7). At turn9: t0=8 -> [5,16] -> safe. So we could be at freeway8 at turn9. \n\nBut in the minimal 9 moves, we would be at freeway8 at turn9? \n\nBut we cannot do 9 moves because we have to avoid freeway1 at turn2. \n\nHowever, let's try a different approach: we wait at the beginning for two turns? Then we can do 9 moves? \n\nTurn1: S -> at turn2: y=0\nTurn2: S -> at turn3: y=0\nThen we start moving up: \nTurn3: U -> at turn4: y=1 (freeway1 at turn4: safe, because freeway1 blocked at 1,2 -> safe at turn4)\nTurn4: U -> at turn5: y=2 (freeway2 at turn5: safe, only blocked at turn2)\nTurn5: U -> at turn6: y=3 (freeway3 at turn6: safe, only blocked at turn2)\nTurn6: U -> at turn7: y=4 (freeway4: safe)\nTurn7: U -> at turn8: y=5 (freeway5: safe)\nTurn8: U -> at turn9: y=6 (freeway6: safe)\nTurn9: U -> at turn10: y=7 (freeway7: safe at turn10? freeway7 blocked only at turn2 -> safe)\nTurn10: U -> at turn11: y=8 (freeway8 at turn11: safe? freeway8 blocked at 6,7,8 -> turn11: t0=10 -> [ -31+40, -20+40] = [9,20] -> safe)\nTurn11: U -> at turn12: y=9.\n\nThis took 11 actions: H=11. That's worse.\n\nAlternatively, we might avoid freeway8 at the dangerous turns by being at freeway8 at turn9? \n\nBut to be at freeway8 at turn9, we must have started moving at turn1: but we cannot because we have to wait at the beginning.\n\nWe start at turn1: we must avoid freeway1 at turn2. So we wait at least one turn.\n\nThen we move up. We can then be at freeway8 at turn10? as in the original plan. \n\nBut if we want to be at freeway8 at turn9, then:\n\nWe need to be at y=0 at turn1, then we wait one turn (turn1: S -> turn2: y=0), then we start moving up at turn2: \n\nTurn2: U -> turn3: y=1\nTurn3: U -> turn4: y=2\nTurn4: U -> turn5: y=3\nTurn5: U -> turn6: y=4\nTurn6: U -> turn7: y=5\nTurn7: U -> turn8: y=6\nTurn8: U -> turn9: y=7\nTurn9: U -> turn10: y=8\n\nThen at turn10: we are at freeway8? and freeway8 is blocked at turn6,7,8 -> turn10: safe? \nBut we are at turn10: we are at freeway8 at turn10: safe? yes, as above.\n\nThen at turn10: we move up to y=9 at turn11.\n\nBut that's 10 actions: same as before.\n\nBut in this plan, we are at freeway8 at turn10? and we move at turn10 to y=9 at turn11.\n\nBut the plan:\n\nTurn1: S\nTurn2: U\nTurn3: U\nTurn4: U\nTurn5: U\nTurn6: U\nTurn7: U\nTurn8: U\nTurn9: U\nTurn10: U\n\nThis is the same as the first plan. \n\nThe only difference is the timing: in the first plan, we are at freeway8 at turn10. In this one too? \n\nActually, in the first plan: \n  turn10: we are at y=8 at the beginning of turn10? and then we move to y=9 at turn11.\n\nBut in the plan above, we have the same sequence.\n\nSo we have only one minimal plan: 10 actions, starting with a wait at turn1.\n\nTherefore, we output the sequence.\n\nBut note: we could have moved down at turn1? But that would also result in staying at 0. So it is equivalent. But the problem doesn't specify a preference. We choose S.\n\nSo the answer is as above.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 1\\) is 10. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\) as follows:\n\n- At turn 1, the player is at \\((0, 0)\\), which is not on a freeway, so no collision check is needed. Staying (S) keeps the player at \\((0, 0)\\) for turn 2.\n- At turn 2, the player is still at \\((0, 0)\\) (safe). Moving up (U) brings the player to \\((0, 1)\\) at the beginning of turn 3.\n- At turn 3, the player is at \\((0, 1)\\) (freeway 1). Freeway 1 is blocked at turns 1 and 2 but safe at turn 3. Moving up (U) brings the player to \\((0, 2)\\) at turn 4.\n- At turn 4, the player is at \\((0, 2)\\) (freeway 2). Freeway 2 is blocked only at turn 2, so safe. Moving up (U) brings the player to \\((0, 3)\\) at turn 5.\n- At turn 5, the player is at \\((0, 3)\\) (freeway 3). Freeway 3 is blocked only at turn 2, so safe. Moving up (U) brings the player to \\((0, 4)\\) at turn 6.\n- At turn 6, the player is at \\((0, 4)\\) (freeway 4). Freeway 4 is never blocked. Moving up (U) brings the player to \\((0, 5)\\) at turn 7.\n- At turn 7, the player is at \\((0, 5)\\) (freeway 5). Freeway 5 is never blocked. Moving up (U) brings the player to \\((0, 6)\\) at turn 8.\n- At turn 8, the player is at \\((0, 6)\\) (freeway 6). Freeway 6 is never blocked. Moving up (U) brings the player to \\((0, 7)\\) at turn 9.\n- At turn 9, the player is at \\((0, 7)\\) (freeway 7). Freeway 7 is blocked only at turn 2, so safe. Moving up (U) brings the player to \\((0, 8)\\) at turn 10.\n- At turn 10, the player is at \\((0, 8)\\) (freeway 8). Freeway 8 is blocked at turns 6, 7, and 8, but safe at turn 10. Moving up (U) brings the player to \\((0, 9)\\) at turn 11.\n\nThe sequence of actions for turns 1 to 10 is:\n\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{array}{c}\n\\text{Turn } 1: & S \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 2: & U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 3: & U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 4: & U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 5: & U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 6: & U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 7: & U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 8: & U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 9: & U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 10: & U \\\\\n\\end{array}\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 2, and the player is at (0,0). We want to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on freeways 1 to 8.\n\nImportant: Collision occurs at turn T only if the player is on a freeway y (from 1 to 8) and at that turn T, the car on that freeway has a span that includes 0.\n\nNote: The player updates their position at the same time as the cars move. Also, when moving from one row to another, note that at the moment of the turn, the player is on the starting row and then moves to the next. Specifically, if at turn T the player is at row y and takes an action to go to y' (which is either y, y+1, or y-1), then during turn T, the player is at row y. Then at the next turn, the player is at row y'. Therefore, at turn T, we only check the cars on the current row y (if y is between 1 and 8) for collision.\n\nWe are given the state at turn t1=2.\n\nWe need to plan a sequence of actions (U, D, S) to go from row 0 to row 9. We start at row 0 at turn 2. We note that row 0 and row 9 are safe because there are no cars (only freeways 1-8 have cars). So we only worry about rows 1 to 8.\n\nWe are to avoid being on a row y (in {1,...,8}) at a turn T when the car(s) on that row have a span that includes the position 0 at that exact turn T.\n\nThe car update: for a car at turn t1=2, we know its head and tail and direction and speed. Then at turn T (>=2), we compute the new head and tail.\n\nFor a left-moving car (direction left): \n   head(T) = head(t1) - s*(T - t1)\n   tail(T) = tail(t1) - s*(T - t1)\n\nFor a right-moving car (direction right):\n   head(T) = head(t1) + s*(T - t1)\n   tail(T) = tail(t1) + s*(T - t1)\n\nBut note: the span is given as [head, tail] for left-moving? Actually, the problem says:\n  Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]\n  Right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nWait, the notation for right-moving at t1 is given as [τ, h] meaning that τ is the leftmost and h the rightmost? Actually, the update for right-moving: \n   at t1: [τ, h] -> at T: [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nSo the car moves to the right. Similarly, for left-moving: [h, τ] at t1 becomes [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)] so the entire car moves left.\n\nBut note: the problem says that collision occurs if 0 is in the span at turn T. So for a car on a freeway, we need to check if 0 is between the two endpoints (inclusive) of the car at turn T.\n\nWe are given multiple cars per freeway. We must avoid all of them.\n\nWe are at turn 2. We want to know for each future turn T and for each row y (from 1 to 8) whether there is a car on row y that covers 0 at turn T.\n\nWe need to compute for each freeway k (1 to 8) and for each car on that freeway, the times T (>=2) at which 0 is in the car's span.\n\nLet's compute for each car the time intervals (if any) during which it covers 0.\n\nBut note: the cars are moving at constant speed. We can compute the time window when the car covers 0.\n\nFor a car on freeway k:\n\nCase 1: Left-moving car (d = left)\n   At turn T, the car spans [h - s*(T-2), τ - s*(T-2)].\n   We require: h - s*(T-2) >= 0 and τ - s*(T-2) <= 0? Actually, we require that 0 is between the two endpoints.\n\n   Since it's left-moving and the span is [h - s*(T-2), τ - s*(T-2)] and note that because it's moving left, the head (which was originally at h) becomes h - s*(T-2) and the tail (originally at τ) becomes τ - s*(T-2). But note: at t1=2, the car is given as (h, τ, d, s). For a left-moving car, the head is the rightmost? Actually, the problem says for left-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, τ]\" meaning that h is the rightmost and τ the leftmost? Because when the car moves left, the rightmost (head) decreases and the leftmost (tail) also decreases.\n\n   So the span [h - s*(T-2), τ - s*(T-2)] is from (rightmost) to (leftmost) and since the car is moving left, the entire segment is shifting left.\n\n   We require that 0 is in [τ - s*(T-2), h - s*(T-2)]? Actually, the interval [a, b] with a<=b? But note: in the left-moving car, the span is given as [h, τ] at t1. But if h is the rightmost and τ the leftmost, then at t1 the car covers [τ, h] (if we think in increasing order). However, the problem writes it as [h, τ] meaning that h is the head (rightmost) and τ is the tail (leftmost). Then the interval in the usual increasing order is [τ, h]. But the update for left-moving: [h - s*(T-2), τ - s*(T-2)]? This would be [a, b] with a = h - s*(T-2) and b = τ - s*(T-2). But note that since the car is moving left, the head (originally at h) becomes h - s*(T-2) and the tail becomes τ - s*(T-2). And because the car is moving left, we have h - s*(T-2) > τ - s*(T-2) because originally h>τ? Actually, in the given data for left-moving, we have a car on freeway 2: (0,23,left,24). This is written as (head, tail, direction, speed). But 0 is the head and 23 is the tail? Then the car would be from 23 to 0? That doesn't make sense because 23>0. \n\nWait, the problem says for left-moving: \"Span(t1)=[h, τ]\" and then updates to [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]. For the freeway 2 car: h=0, τ=23, d=left, s=24. Then at T=2, the car spans [0,23]. But that would be from 0 to 23? Then it's moving left? Actually, if it moves left, then at T=3, it would be [0-24, 23-24] = [-24, -1]. So the car is moving left and the entire segment is shifting left by 24 per turn.\n\nBut then the condition for covering 0: we require that 0 is in [h - s*(T-2), τ - s*(T-2)]? But note: in this example, at T=2, the car is [0,23] which includes 0. But wait: the problem says for left-moving: the span at t1 is [h, τ] and then at T it becomes [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]. But if we interpret [a, b] as the interval from a to b, then if a<=b, then we require a<=0<=b. But in the freeway2 car: at T=2: [0,23] -> 0<=0<=23 -> true.\n\nHowever, note that the car on freeway2: (0,23,left,24) -> at T=2: [0,23]. But 0 is included? Yes.\n\nBut wait: the problem says for left-moving: \"Span(t1)=[h, τ]\" and then updates. But if h is the head and τ the tail, and the car is moving left, then the head is the front? Then the head should be the leftmost? Actually, no: if the car is moving left, then the head is the front of the car in the direction of movement. So if it's moving left, the head is the leftmost? Then the tail is the rightmost? Then the span would be [head, tail] with head < tail? But in the example, h=0, τ=23, and 0<23. Then the car is from 0 to 23? Then moving left: the entire car moves left, so the leftmost (head) moves left and the rightmost (tail) moves left.\n\nSo for a left-moving car: the head is the leftmost and the tail is the rightmost? Then the car covers [head, tail]. \n\nSimilarly, for a right-moving car: the head is the rightmost and the tail is the leftmost? Because the problem says: for right-moving, span(t1)=[τ, h] -> meaning [tail, head] and then updates to [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]. So at T, the car covers [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)] and since the car is moving right, the tail (leftmost) moves right and the head (rightmost) moves right.\n\nSo to summarize:\n\n- Left-moving car: \n   at turn T: [head(t1) - s*(T-t1), tail(t1) - s*(T-t1)] \n   and note: head(t1) <= tail(t1) (because the head is the leftmost and the tail the rightmost).\n\n- Right-moving car:\n   at turn T: [tail(t1) + s*(T-t1), head(t1) + s*(T-t1)]\n   and tail(t1) <= head(t1) (because tail is leftmost, head is rightmost).\n\nTherefore, for a car (either type) we can compute an interval [L(T), R(T)] that the car occupies at turn T.\n\nWe require that 0 is in [L(T), R(T)] for a collision to occur on that freeway at turn T.\n\nNow, we are going to compute for each freeway and each car the set of turns T (>=2) when 0 is in the car's span.\n\nBut note: we are at turn 2, and we are going to simulate from turn 2 onward.\n\nWe need to avoid being on a freeway row (1-8) at a turn T when any car on that row covers 0 at T.\n\nWe are going to precompute for each row and for each turn T (starting from T=2) whether the row is safe (i.e., no car covers 0 at T) or not.\n\nWe are going to simulate until we find a path to row 9.\n\nHowever, note that the minimal H might be large? But we can use BFS over states: state = (turn, row). But the turn can be very large? However, the cars are moving and eventually the cars will move away? But note: there might be periodic patterns? But we are to minimize H, so we want the shortest path.\n\nWe note that the grid is only 10 rows (0 to 9) and the cars are moving at constant speeds. We can compute the danger for each row and each turn for a bounded time. What is the maximum turns we need? The minimal H is at least 9 (if we go up without stopping) but we might have to wait. So let's say we consider up to 20 turns? But we must be cautious: the cars on row 3: (24, -11, right, 36) -> this car is moving right at 36 per turn. At T=2: [ -11 + 36*(0) ??? Wait, no: we are at turn t1=2, so T-2 is the offset.\n\nActually, for a car at turn T, we compute T-2.\n\nLet me compute the danger intervals for each car:\n\nWe'll do per freeway and per car.\n\nFreeway 1 (k=1): two cars: \n  car1: (56,45,right,4) -> right-moving: \n      L(T) = τ + s*(T-2) = 45 + 4*(T-2)\n      R(T) = h + s*(T-2) = 56 + 4*(T-2)\n      We require 0 in [45+4*(T-2), 56+4*(T-2)]\n      => 45+4*(T-2) <= 0 <= 56+4*(T-2)\n\n      First inequality: 45+4*(T-2) <= 0 -> 4*(T-2) <= -45 -> T-2 <= -45/4 = -11.25 -> impossible (T>=2). \n      So never covers 0.\n\n  car2: (8,-3,right,4) -> \n      L(T) = -3 + 4*(T-2)\n      R(T) = 8 + 4*(T-2)\n      We require: -3+4*(T-2) <= 0 <= 8+4*(T-2)\n\n      The second inequality: 0<=8+4*(T-2) -> always true for T>=2? \n      The first: -3+4*(T-2) <=0 -> 4*(T-2) <=3 -> T-2<=0.75 -> T<=2.75 -> so only T=2? \n\n      At T=2: \n          L(2) = -3 + 0 = -3, R(2)=8 -> 0 is in [-3,8] -> true.\n\n      So car2 on freeway1 at T=2 covers 0.\n\nTherefore, at turn 2, freeway1 is unsafe.\n\nFreeway 2: one car: (0,23,left,24) -> left-moving.\n   L(T) = head - s*(T-2) = 0 - 24*(T-2) = -24*(T-2)\n   R(T) = tail - s*(T-2) = 23 - 24*(T-2)\n   We require: -24*(T-2) <= 0 <= 23 - 24*(T-2)\n\n   The first inequality: -24*(T-2)<=0 -> T-2>=0 -> always true for T>=2.\n   The second: 0<=23-24*(T-2) -> 24*(T-2)<=23 -> T-2<=23/24<1 -> so T-2=0 -> T=2.\n\n   At T=2: L(2)=0, R(2)=23 -> 0 is in [0,23] -> true.\n\n   So freeway2 is unsafe at T=2.\n\nFreeway 3: (24,-11,right,36) -> right-moving.\n   L(T) = τ + s*(T-2) = -11 + 36*(T-2)\n   R(T) = h + s*(T-2) = 24 + 36*(T-2)\n   We require: -11+36*(T-2) <=0<=24+36*(T-2)\n\n   The second inequality: 0<=24+36*(T-2) -> always true for T>=2.\n   The first: -11+36*(T-2)<=0 -> 36*(T-2)<=11 -> T-2<=11/36<1 -> so only T=2.\n\n   At T=2: L(2)=-11, R(2)=24 -> 0 in [-11,24] -> true.\n\n   So freeway3 is unsafe at T=2.\n\nFreeway 4: (-48,-59,right,12) -> right-moving.\n   Note: tail = -59, head = -48? \n   L(T) = -59 + 12*(T-2)\n   R(T) = -48 + 12*(T-2)\n   We require: -59+12*(T-2) <=0<=-48+12*(T-2)\n\n   First: -59+12*(T-2)<=0 -> 12*(T-2)<=59 -> T-2<=59/12≈4.916 -> so T<=6.916 -> T=2,3,4,5,6\n   Second: 0<=-48+12*(T-2) -> 12*(T-2)>=48 -> T-2>=4 -> T>=6.\n\n   So T=6: \n        at T=6: L(6)=-59+12*4 = -59+48=-11, R(6)=-48+48=0 -> 0 in [-11,0] -> true.\n        T=7: L(7)=-59+12*5=-59+60=1, R(7)=-48+60=12 -> 0 not in [1,12] -> safe.\n\n   So T=6 is unsafe? But wait: we have T=6: the interval is [-11,0] -> 0 is included? Yes.\n\n   Actually, the condition is closed interval. So at T=6: the car covers from -11 to 0 -> so 0 is included.\n\n   Also T=5: L(5)=-59+12*3=-59+36=-23, R(5)=-48+36=-12 -> 0 not in [-23,-12] -> safe.\n   T=4: L(4)=-59+24=-35, R(4)=-48+24=-24 -> safe.\n   T=3: L(3)=-59+12=-47, R(3)=-48+12=-36 -> safe.\n   T=2: L(2)=-59, R(2)=-48 -> 0 not in [-59,-48] -> safe.\n\n   Actually, we found that T=6 is unsafe? But we only got T from the intersection: T must be at least 6 and at most 6? Because from the second inequality: T>=6, and from the first T<=6.916 -> so only T=6? \n\n   But wait: T must be integer? Yes, turns are integers.\n\n   So freeway4 is unsafe at T=6.\n\nFreeway5: same as freeway4? (-48,-59,right,12) -> same as above: unsafe at T=6.\n\nFreeway6: same as freeway4: unsafe at T=6.\n\nFreeway7: (24,-11,right,36) -> same as freeway3: unsafe at T=2.\n\nFreeway8: three cars: \n   car1: (56,45,right,4) -> same as freeway1 car1: never unsafe.\n   car2: (20,9,right,4) -> \n        L(T)=9+4*(T-2)\n        R(T)=20+4*(T-2)\n        We require: 9+4*(T-2)<=0<=20+4*(T-2)\n\n        The first: 9+4*(T-2)<=0 -> 4*(T-2)<=-9 -> T-2<=-2.25 -> impossible.\n\n        So safe.\n\n   car3: (-16,-27,right,4) -> \n        L(T)=-27+4*(T-2)\n        R(T)=-16+4*(T-2)\n        We require: -27+4*(T-2)<=0<=-16+4*(T-2)\n\n        Second: 0<=-16+4*(T-2) -> 4*(T-2)>=16 -> T-2>=4 -> T>=6.\n        First: -27+4*(T-2)<=0 -> 4*(T-2)<=27 -> T-2<=6.75 -> T<=8.75 -> so T=6,7,8.\n\n        At T=6: [-27+16, -16+16] = [-11,0] -> 0 included -> unsafe at T=6.\n        At T=7: [-27+20, -16+20] = [-7,4] -> 0 included? yes -> unsafe at T=7.\n        At T=8: [-27+24, -16+24] = [-3,8] -> 0 included? yes -> unsafe at T=8.\n\n        So freeway8 car3: unsafe at T=6,7,8.\n\nTherefore, for each freeway and turn T, we have:\n\nFreeway 1: unsafe at T=2 (from car2) -> safe for T>=3?\n   Actually, we computed car1: safe always; car2: only unsafe at T=2? So freeway1: unsafe at T=2, safe for T>=3.\n\nFreeway 2: unsafe at T=2, and for T>2: \n   At T=3: [0-24, 23-24] = [-24,-1] -> 0 not in -> safe for T>=3.\n\nFreeway 3: unsafe at T=2, and for T>2: \n   At T=3: [-11+36, 24+36] = [25,60] -> safe? \n   Actually, we computed only T=2 is unsafe? So safe for T>=3.\n\nFreeway 4: unsafe only at T=6? and safe at other times? (as we computed: T=2,3,4,5,7,... safe)\n\nFreeway 5: same as 4: unsafe at T=6.\n\nFreeway 6: same as 4: unsafe at T=6.\n\nFreeway 7: same as 3: unsafe at T=2, safe for T>=3.\n\nFreeway 8: \n   car1: safe always.\n   car2: safe always.\n   car3: unsafe at T=6,7,8 -> so freeway8 is unsafe at T=6,7,8.\n\nSummary by row and turn:\n\nWe are interested in turns T>=2.\n\nRow 1: unsafe at T=2, safe for T>=3.\nRow 2: unsafe at T=2, safe for T>=3.\nRow 3: unsafe at T=2, safe for T>=3.\nRow 4: unsafe at T=6, safe otherwise.\nRow 5: unsafe at T=6, safe otherwise.\nRow 6: unsafe at T=6, safe otherwise.\nRow 7: unsafe at T=2, safe for T>=3.\nRow 8: unsafe at T=6,7,8, safe otherwise.\n\nNow, we start at turn 2, row 0. We can only move to row 0,1? But we are at row 0. We can choose to go up (to row1) or stay (row0) or down? but row0 is the bottom, so we cannot go down. So at turn2, we can only do S (stay at 0) or U (go to 1). But if we go to row1 at turn2: then at turn2 we are on row1 -> unsafe (because row1 is unsafe at T=2). So we must avoid row1 at turn2.\n\nTherefore, at turn2, we must do S: stay at row0.\n\nThen at turn3: we are still at row0? No, we did S so we remain at row0 at the next turn? Actually, the update: at turn t, we are at row y_t, then we take action a_t which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nAt turn2: we are at (0,0). If we take S, then at turn3 we are still at (0,0).\n\nBut wait: the problem says: \n   at turn T, we are at row y_T, and we take action a_T to determine y_{T+1}.\n\nAnd at turn T, we check the row y_T for collision.\n\nAt turn2: we are at row0 -> no car, so safe. Then we take an action a_2.\n\nWe must do S at turn2 to avoid going to row1 (which is unsafe at turn2). Then at turn3, we are at row0.\n\nNow at turn3: we are at row0. What can we do? We can do S again, or U to row1, or D? D would go to row -1? But the grid is y in [0,9]. So we cannot go below 0. So D is not allowed? Actually, the update says y_{t+1} in [0,9]. So if we try D at row0, we stay at 0? Or is it forced to stay? The problem says: \n   Δy_t = -1 if a_t=D, but then y_{t+1}=y_t-1, but then clamped to [0,9]. So if we try to go down from 0, we stay at 0.\n\nSo actions from row0: U -> next row=1, S->0, D->0.\n\nNow at turn3: row0 is safe. We can consider going to row1 at turn3? \nBut row1 at turn3: we just computed that row1 is safe for T>=3. So at turn3, row1 is safe.\n\nSo we can do U at turn3: then at turn4 we will be at row1.\n\nBut note: when we are at turn3 and at row0, we take action U. Then at turn4 we arrive at row1. But during turn3, we are at row0 -> safe. Then at turn4, we are at row1. We must check row1 at turn4: safe? yes, because row1 is safe for T>=3, and turn4>=3.\n\nWe want to go to row9. The minimal steps without waiting would be: from 0 to 9: 9 moves up. But we have to avoid the unsafe rows at unsafe times.\n\nWe must avoid row4,5,6 at turn6? and row8 at turns6,7,8.\n\nWe start at turn2 at row0.\n\nTurn2: S -> then at turn3: row0.\n\nTurn3: U -> turn4: row1.\n\nTurn4: U -> turn5: row2.\n\nTurn5: U -> turn6: row3.\n\nBut at turn6: we are going to be at row3? Then we must check row3 at turn6: row3 is safe at turn6? Yes, because row3 is unsafe only at turn2, and safe for T>=3. So row3 at turn6 is safe.\n\nThen we can continue:\n\nTurn6: U -> turn7: row4.\n\nBut at turn7: we are at row4. We must check row4 at turn7: row4 is safe at turn7? Yes, because row4 is unsafe only at turn6. So safe.\n\nThen turn7: U -> turn8: row5.\n\nAt turn8: row5 -> row5 is unsafe only at turn6 -> safe at turn8.\n\nTurn8: U -> turn9: row6.\n\nAt turn9: row6 -> row6 is unsafe only at turn6 -> safe at turn9.\n\nTurn9: U -> turn10: row7.\n\nAt turn10: row7 -> row7 is safe at turn10? row7 is unsafe only at turn2 -> safe.\n\nTurn10: U -> turn11: row8.\n\nAt turn11: row8 -> row8 is unsafe at turns6,7,8 -> safe at turn11.\n\nThen turn11: U -> turn12: row9 -> done.\n\nTotal turns: from turn2 to turn12, that's 11 turns? But we started at turn2 and we did 10 actions: \n   turn2: S\n   turn3: U\n   turn4: U\n   turn5: U\n   turn6: U\n   turn7: U\n   turn8: U\n   turn9: U\n   turn10: U\n   turn11: U\n   turn12: (we don't need to do an action at turn12 because at turn11 we are at row8 and then we do U to go to row9 at turn12, and at turn12 we are at row9 -> done at turn12).\n\nBut the problem: we are to output the sequence of actions from turn t1 (which is 2) to the turn when we reach row9. And we are to minimize H, the number of turns in the sequence? Actually, the sequence is for t from t1 to t1+H-1. And we require that at turn t1+H-1, we are at row9.\n\nIn our plan: at turn12 we are at row9. So H = 12 - 2 + 1? No, because the sequence of actions is from turn2 to turn11 (inclusive). That's 10 actions? And then at turn12 we are at row9. So the last action is at turn11, and we are at row9 at the next state (turn12). So the sequence is for turns: 2,3,4,...,11 -> 10 turns. Then H=10.\n\nBut is there a faster way?\n\nWe started at turn2, and we did 10 actions (so H=10) and we end at turn12 (which is the state after the 10th action) at row9.\n\nBut we could try to go faster? For example, if we don't wait at the beginning? We had to wait at turn2 because row1 was unsafe at turn2. But what if we do U at turn2? Then we go to row1 at turn3? But at turn2: we are at row0 -> safe. Then we do U at turn2: then at turn3 we are at row1. But during turn2, we are at row0 -> safe. Then at turn3, we are at row1. Is row1 safe at turn3? Yes, as we computed. Then we can proceed:\n\nTurn2: U -> turn3: row1 (safe)\nTurn3: U -> turn4: row2 (safe, because row2 safe for T>=3, and turn4>=3)\nTurn4: U -> turn5: row3 (safe)\nTurn5: U -> turn6: row4 -> but row4 is unsafe at turn6! -> collision.\n\nSo we cannot go to row4 at turn6.\n\nTherefore, we must avoid being on row4,5,6 at turn6. Similarly, we must avoid row8 at turns6,7,8.\n\nSo in the above plan that started with a wait, we were at row3 at turn6 (safe) and then row4 at turn7 (safe) and so on.\n\nBut can we go faster by waiting less? We had to wait one turn at the beginning. What if we wait in the middle?\n\nFor example: we start at turn2: we do U -> turn3: row1 (safe)\nThen turn3: U -> turn4: row2 (safe)\nThen turn4: U -> turn5: row3 (safe)\nThen at turn5: we are at row3. If we do U at turn5, we go to row4 at turn6 -> unsafe. So we must not go to row4 at turn6. Instead, we can do S at turn5: then we stay at row3 at turn6? Actually, at turn5: we are at row3 -> we do S -> then at turn6 we are still at row3. And row3 at turn6 is safe? Yes. Then at turn6: we can do U -> turn7: row4. But row4 at turn7 is safe. Then we can continue.\n\nBut then we have:\n\nTurn2: U -> turn3: row1\nTurn3: U -> turn4: row2\nTurn4: U -> turn5: row3\nTurn5: S -> turn6: row3   (wait at row3 for one turn)\nTurn6: U -> turn7: row4\nTurn7: U -> turn8: row5\nTurn8: U -> turn9: row6\nTurn9: U -> turn10: row7\nTurn10: U -> turn11: row8\nBut row8 at turn11: safe? Yes, because row8 is unsafe only at 6,7,8 -> safe at turn11.\nTurn11: U -> turn12: row9.\n\nSame as before: 10 actions? And we end at turn12.\n\nBut we did one wait at turn5. Previously we did one wait at turn2. So same total steps.\n\nBut what if we avoid row8 at turns6,7,8 by waiting? We might be able to go faster? \n\nAlternatively, we can try to go through the unsafe rows earlier? \n\nBut row4,5,6 are unsafe only at turn6? So if we can pass row4,5,6 before turn6 or after turn6? \n\nWe start at turn2 at row0. The earliest we can be at row4 is turn6: \n   turn2: row0 -> turn3: row1 -> turn4: row2 -> turn5: row3 -> turn6: row4 -> but unsafe.\n\nSo we cannot be at row4 at turn6. The next chance: we must be at row4 at turn7 or later? \n\nSimilarly, row5: if we are at row5 at turn6: unsafe. So we must be at row5 at turn5 or earlier? or turn7 or later? But if we are at row5 at turn5: \n   We start: \n      turn2: row0 -> turn3: row1 -> turn4: row2 -> turn5: row3 -> then we cannot be at row5 at turn5 because we are only at row3 at turn5. \n\nTo be at row5 at turn5: \n   turn2: row0 -> turn3: row1 -> turn4: row2 -> turn5: row3 -> then we need two more moves to get to row5? So at least turn6 for row5? \n\nSimilarly, row6: at least turn7? \n\nBut we must avoid row4 at turn6: so we cannot be at row4 at turn6. So we have to be at row4 at turn7 or later.\n\nSimilarly, row5: we must avoid turn6 -> so at turn7 or later? \nBut if we are at row5 at turn7: then we were at row4 at turn6? But row4 at turn6 is unsafe. So we cannot be at row4 at turn6 -> so we cannot be at row5 at turn7? Because to be at row5 at turn7, we must have been at row4 at turn6. \n\nWait: \n   To get to row5 at turn7: \n        at turn7: we are at row5 -> so at turn6 we were at row4 (if we did U from row4 at turn6) or row5 (if we did S) or row6 (if we did D). But if we are at row5 at turn7, then we must have been at row4,5, or6 at turn6. \n\nBut if we were at row4 at turn6: unsafe. \nIf we were at row5 at turn6: unsafe (row5 unsafe at turn6). \nIf we were at row6 at turn6: unsafe (row6 unsafe at turn6). \n\nSo we cannot be at row5 at turn7? \n\nSimilarly, we cannot be at row6 at turn7? Because then we were at row5 at turn6 (unsafe) or row6 at turn6 (unsafe) or row7 at turn6? But to be at row7 at turn6: \n   We start: \n        turn2: row0 -> turn3: row1 -> turn4: row2 -> turn5: row3 -> turn6: row4 -> but row4 at turn6 unsafe -> not possible.\n\nTherefore, we must avoid being on rows 4,5,6 at turn6, and we also cannot be on row5 at turn7 (because we would have come from row4 at turn6) and similarly for row6 at turn7? \n\nBut wait: what if we are at row5 at turn7 by having been at row6 at turn6? Then we did D from row6 at turn6 to go to row5 at turn7? But row6 at turn6 is unsafe. So that is not allowed.\n\nTherefore, the only safe way is to pass row4 at turn7 or later, row5 at turn8 or later, row6 at turn9 or later? \n\nBut note: we can also be at row4 at turn5? \n   To be at row4 at turn5: \n        turn2: row0 -> turn3: row1 -> turn4: row2 -> turn5: row3 -> then we need to go to row4 at turn5? But we are at row3 at turn5, so we can go to row4 at turn6? \n\nActually, the state at turn5: we are at row3. Then we take U at turn5: then at turn6 we are at row4. But turn6: row4 is unsafe.\n\nSo we cannot be at row4 at turn5? Because we can only get there by being at row3 at turn5 and then doing U at turn5 to go to row4 at turn6? \n\nWe can only be at row4 at turn T if we were at row3 at turn T-1 and did U, or at row4 at turn T-1 and did S, or at row5 at turn T-1 and did D.\n\nSo the earliest we can be at row4 is turn6? and that is unsafe. Then the next chance is turn7: \n   To be at row4 at turn7: \n        We must have been at row3 at turn6 (and did S) or row4 at turn6 (and did D) or row5 at turn6 (and did D)? But row4 and row5 at turn6 are unsafe. \n        So we must have been at row3 at turn6 and did S -> then at turn7 we are at row3? Or did D? from row3 at turn6: D would go to row2 at turn7? \n\nTo get to row4 at turn7: \n   We must have been at row3 at turn6 and then did U at turn6: then at turn7 we are at row4. \n   But row3 at turn6 is safe? Yes. Then at turn7 we are at row4 -> safe? Yes, because row4 unsafe only at turn6.\n\nSimilarly, to be at row5 at turn8: \n   We can be at row4 at turn7 (safe) and then do U at turn7 -> row5 at turn8 (safe, because row5 unsafe only at turn6).\n\nRow6 at turn9: \n   from row5 at turn8 (safe) and do U at turn8 -> row6 at turn9 (safe).\n\nThen row7 at turn10: U from row6 at turn9 -> row7 at turn10 (safe).\nRow8 at turn11: U from row7 at turn10 -> row8 at turn11 (safe, because row8 unsafe only at 6,7,8, and turn11>8).\nThen row9 at turn12: U from row8 at turn11.\n\nSo the plan:\n\nTurn2: we start at row0. We can do S (to avoid row1 at turn2) or U? But if we do U at turn2, we go to row1 at turn3. Then we can proceed:\n\nTurn2: U -> turn3: row1 (safe)\nTurn3: U -> turn4: row2 (safe)\nTurn4: U -> turn5: row3 (safe)\nThen at turn5: we are at row3. We do nothing? Then at turn6: we must avoid row4,5,6. So we can stay at row3? \nTurn5: S -> then at turn6: row3 (safe)\nTurn6: U -> turn7: row4 (safe)\nTurn7: U -> turn8: row5 (safe)\nTurn8: U -> turn9: row6 (safe)\nTurn9: U -> turn10: row7 (safe)\nTurn10: U -> turn11: row8 (safe)\nTurn11: U -> turn12: row9.\n\nThis is 10 actions? From turn2 to turn11: 10 actions. Same as the first plan.\n\nBut in the first plan we did:\n   turn2: S\n   turn3: U\n   turn4: U\n   turn5: U\n   turn6: U\n   turn7: U\n   turn8: U\n   turn9: U\n   turn10: U\n   turn11: U\n\nThat's 10 actions. And we end at row9 at turn12.\n\nIn the second plan:\n   turn2: U\n   turn3: U\n   turn4: U\n   turn5: S\n   turn6: U\n   turn7: U\n   turn8: U\n   turn9: U\n   turn10: U\n   turn11: U\n\nAlso 10 actions.\n\nBut note: the first plan started with a wait at turn2, then moved up continuously from turn3 to turn11 (9 moves up) but we started at row0 at turn3 and ended at row9 at turn12: that's 9 moves? Actually, from row0 to row9: 9 moves. But we had an extra wait at the beginning.\n\nThe second plan: we moved up 3 moves (turn2 to turn5: from row0 to row3) in 3 moves, then waited at row3 for one turn (turn5: S), then moved up 6 moves (from row3 to row9: 6 moves) in 6 turns. Total moves: 3+1+6 = 10.\n\nBut we might be able to skip the wait? \n\nAlternatively, we can try to go down? But we are at row0, we cannot go down. \n\nIs there a way to take more than one wait? That would be slower.\n\nBut we want minimal H. \n\nIs there a way to do it in 9 actions? Then we would be at row9 at turn11.\n\nWe start at turn2 at row0. Then we do 9 actions: turns2 to 10. Then at turn11 we are at row9.\n\nTo get to row9 in 9 moves: we must do 9 Ups. But we have to avoid the unsafe states.\n\nThe moves would be:\n\nTurn2: U -> turn3: row1 (safe)\nTurn3: U -> turn4: row2 (safe)\nTurn4: U -> turn5: row3 (safe)\nTurn5: U -> turn6: row4 -> unsafe (row4 at turn6 unsafe) -> not allowed.\n\nSo we cannot do 9 consecutive Ups.\n\nWhat if we do 8 Ups and one wait? Then we would be at row8 at the end? not row9.\n\nWe need 9 Ups to go from row0 to row9? Actually, from row0 to row1: one U, row1 to row2: second U, ... row8 to row9: ninth U. So we need 9 Ups.\n\nBut we must have one wait somewhere? So 10 actions: 9 Ups and one S.\n\nBut where to put the wait? We have to avoid:\n\n- At turn6: we cannot be on row4,5,6,8? (row8 at turn6 unsafe) -> but we are moving up, so at turn6 we are at row4? if we did 4 Ups: \n   turn2: U -> row1 at turn3\n   turn3: U -> row2 at turn4\n   turn4: U -> row3 at turn5\n   turn5: U -> row4 at turn6 -> unsafe.\n\nSo we must avoid being at row4 at turn6. Therefore, we must not do the fourth U at turn5? Then we have to wait at some row below row4 at turn5? \n\nWe can wait at row3 at turn5: then we do S at turn5 -> then at turn6 we are at row3 (safe). Then we can do U at turn6 to go to row4 at turn7 (safe). Then we continue.\n\nSo the 9 Ups and one S:\n\n   turn2: U (1) -> row1 at turn3\n   turn3: U (2) -> row2 at turn4\n   turn4: U (3) -> row3 at turn5\n   turn5: S   -> wait at row3 at turn6? Actually, at turn5 we are at row3 -> we do S -> then at turn6 we are at row3 (state at turn6: row3, safe)\n   turn6: U (4) -> row4 at turn7\n   turn7: U (5) -> row5 at turn8\n   turn8: U (6) -> row6 at turn9\n   turn9: U (7) -> row7 at turn10\n   turn10: U (8) -> row8 at turn11\n   turn11: U (9) -> row9 at turn12\n\nBut we did 10 actions: from turn2 to turn11. And we end at row9 at turn12.\n\nBut we are missing one? We did 9 Ups and one S: 10 actions. And we need 10 actions to get from row0 to row9 with one wait.\n\nIs there a way to do it without the wait? We have to avoid row4 at turn6. But we cannot be at row4 at any turn other than turn6? Actually, we can be at row4 at turn7, but then we have to have been at row3 at turn6. But we can only get to row3 at turn6 by having been at row3 at turn5 and done S? or from row2 at turn5 and done U? \n\nBut to be at row3 at turn6: \n   We must have been at row3 at turn5 and done S at turn5, or \n   at row2 at turn5 and done U at turn5 -> then at turn6 we are at row3.\n\nBut if we do U at turn5 from row2 at turn5: \n   Then we are at row3 at turn6. \n\nBut then we are at row3 at turn6, which is safe. Then we can do U at turn6 to go to row4 at turn7.\n\nBut then we have:\n\n   turn2: U -> row1 at turn3\n   turn3: U -> row2 at turn4\n   turn4: S? or U? \n        If we do U at turn4: then at turn5: row3 -> then at turn5 we are at row3. Then at turn5 we do U? -> then at turn6: row4 -> unsafe.\n        If we do S at turn4: then at turn5: row2 -> then at turn5 we do U: then at turn6: row3 (safe). Then at turn6: U -> turn7: row4 (safe).\n\nSo:\n\n   turn2: U (1)\n   turn3: U (2)\n   turn4: S   (wait at row2)\n   turn5: U (3) -> row3 at turn6\n   turn6: U (4) -> row4 at turn7\n   turn7: U (5) -> row5 at turn8\n   turn8: U (6) -> row6 at turn9\n   turn9: U (7) -> row7 at turn10\n   turn10: U (8) -> row8 at turn11\n   turn11: U (9) -> row9 at turn12\n\nAgain 10 actions.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid row8 at turns6,7,8. In the above, we are at row8 at turn11: safe. \n\nBut we did 9 Ups and one S: 10 actions.\n\nSo minimal H is 10.\n\nNow, we must output the sequence. We have multiple possibilities. The problem asks for minimal H, and if multiple, any.\n\nWe can choose the first one we thought: \n   turn2: S (wait at row0 at turn2 to avoid row1 at turn2)\n   then 9 consecutive Ups.\n\nBut let me check the safety:\n\nTurn2: we are at row0 -> safe. Action: S -> so at turn3: row0.\n\nTurn3: we are at row0 -> safe. Action: U -> at turn4: row1.\n   At turn3: we are at row0 -> safe.\n\nTurn4: we are at row1 -> safe (because row1 safe for T>=3). Action: U -> turn5: row2.\n   At turn4: row1 safe.\n\nTurn5: row2 -> safe. Action: U -> turn6: row3.\n   At turn5: row2 safe.\n\nTurn6: row3 -> safe (row3 safe for T>=3). Action: U -> turn7: row4.\n   At turn6: row3 safe.\n\nTurn7: row4 -> safe (row4 unsafe only at turn6). Action: U -> turn8: row5.\n   At turn7: row4 safe.\n\nTurn8: row5 -> safe. Action: U -> turn9: row6.\n   At turn8: row5 safe.\n\nTurn9: row6 -> safe. Action: U -> turn10: row7.\n   At turn9: row6 safe.\n\nTurn10: row7 -> safe. Action: U -> turn11: row8.\n   At turn10: row7 safe.\n\nTurn11: row8 -> safe (row8 unsafe at 6,7,8 -> turn11 is safe). Action: U -> turn12: row9.\n\nAt turn12: we are at row9 -> goal.\n\nSo the sequence of actions for turns 2 to 11 (10 actions):\n\nTurn2: S\nTurn3: U\nTurn4: U\nTurn5: U\nTurn6: U\nTurn7: U\nTurn8: U\nTurn9: U\nTurn10: U\nTurn11: U\n\nBut wait, the last action is at turn11 and then at turn12 we are at row9. So we don't take an action at turn12? The sequence is from t1 to t1+H-1, and we are to have H actions? Then we are at row9 at the next state.\n\nSo we output:\n\nTurn 2: S\nTurn 3: U\nTurn 4: U\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\n\nBut is there a way to do it in 9 actions? We argued that we need 10 because we need 9 Ups and one wait. So no.\n\nAlternatively, we could use a wait at a different row? But we always need 10 actions.\n\nSo we output the above.\n\nBut note: in the beginning we saw that if we do U at turn2 we can also do it with a wait at turn5. Both are 10 actions.\n\nBut the problem does not specify which one, so we can choose.\n\nWe choose the first one: starting with S at turn2.\n\nSo the answer:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 2: S\nTurn 3: U\nTurn 4: U\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\n}\n\nBut wait: the minimal number of turns H is 10? Yes.\n\nBut let me double-check: \n   At turn2: we do S -> then at turn3: we are at row0.\n   Then we do 9 Ups: from turn3 to turn11: 9 Ups -> we go from row0 to row9 in 9 moves? \n        turn3: row0->row1\n        turn4: row1->row2\n        turn5: row2->row3\n        turn6: row3->row4\n        turn7: row4->row5\n        turn8: row5->row6\n        turn9: row6->row7\n        turn10: row7->row8\n        turn11: row8->row9\n\nSo at turn12: we are at row9. But the last action is at turn11. So we did 10 actions (from turn2 to turn11). \n\nAnd we are safe at every step.\n\nBut note: at turn6: we are moving from row3 to row4. At turn6: we are at row3 (because we are taking the action at turn6 to go to row4, but during turn6 we are at row3). And row3 at turn6 is safe. Then at turn7: we are at row4 -> and row4 at turn7 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, we are never on a row that is unsafe at that turn.\n\nSo it works.\n\nBut what about the cars on row8 at turn6,7,8? We are at row8 at turn11: safe.\n\nSo the sequence is valid.\n\nTherefore, the answer is as above.\n</think>\nTo reach the position (0, 9) from (0, 0) at turn \\(t_1 = 2\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1, \\dots, 8\\), the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 10. The sequence of actions ensures the player moves safely by avoiding rows at turns when cars cover position 0.\n\n- At turn 2, the player is at row 0. Moving up to row 1 would cause a collision because row 1 is unsafe at turn 2 (car coverage at 0). Therefore, the action is S (stay), and the player remains at row 0 for turn 3.\n- From turns 3 to 11, the player moves up (U) consecutively. The path avoids unsafe rows at critical turns:\n  - Rows 1, 2, 3, and 7 are unsafe only at turn 2, so they are safe from turn 3 onward.\n  - Rows 4, 5, and 6 are unsafe only at turn 6, so they are safe at turns 7, 8, and 9 respectively.\n  - Row 8 is unsafe at turns 6, 7, and 8, so it is safe at turn 11.\n- The player reaches row 9 at turn 12 after the 10th action (at turn 11).\n\nThe action sequence is:\n\n```\nTurn 2: S\nTurn 3: U\nTurn 4: U\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\n```\n\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{array}{c}\n\\text{Turn } 2: & \\text{S} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 3: & \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 4: & \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 5: & \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 6: & \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 7: & \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 8: & \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 9: & \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 10: & \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 11: & \\text{U} \\\\\n\\end{array}\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to get the player from (0,0) at turn t1=3 to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to 8. The player moves vertically: up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing y by +1, -1, or 0 respectively, and y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars are on each freeway y=1 to 8, and they move horizontally. For each car, I'm given its position at turn t1=3: head, tail, direction, and speed. Direction is left or right, which affects how the span changes over time.\n\nCollision happens at turn T if the player is on a freeway y_T and there's a car on that freeway such that 0 is in the car's span at that turn. The note says that if you move to a different y at turn T, you're not on that new y until the next turn, so you only check the car on your current y at the start of the turn.\n\nThe player position is updated at each turn based on the action, and collision is checked based on the player's y at that turn and the car spans at that exact turn.\n\nI need to find a sequence of actions starting from turn t1=3 for H turns, ending at y=9.\n\nCurrent turn is t1=3, player at (0,0). Since y=0 is not a freeway, there are no cars there, so no collision at y=0. But the goal is to reach y=9, which might have cars, but since it's the end point, I think we need to be at y=9 without collision at that turn.\n\nThe collision condition is only when on freeways y=1 to 8, I think. y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, so no cars there. Let me confirm.\n\nThe freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars. Collision only possible when y_t is between 1 and 8 inclusive.\n\nAt turn T, if y_T is between 1 and 8, and for the car on that freeway, 0 is in the span at turn T, then collision.\n\nBut for y=0 or y=9, since no freeway, no collision possible.\n\nSo starting at (0,0), which is safe, and need to reach (0,9), which is also safe.\n\nBut to get to y=9, I need to pass through y=1 to 8, where there might be cars.\n\nNow, I need to compute for each freeway and each future turn, where the cars are, to avoid being on that y when 0 is covered.\n\nFirst, let's list all the cars at turn t1=3.\n\nFreeway k=1: cars: (60,49,right,4) and (12,1,right,4)\n\nSince direction is right, for right-moving cars, span is [tail, head]? Let's see the update rule.\n\nFrom the problem:\n\nFor left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nFor right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nIn the right-moving case, it says Span(t1) = [τ, h] meaning τ is tail, h is head? But in the input, for k=1, it says (60,49,right,4), so I think the first number is head, second is tail.\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\nFor car on freeway i, head at h, tail at τ at turn t1.\n\nThen for left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT] where ΔT = T - t1\n\nFor right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] → [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT]\n\nIn the right-moving case, Span(t1) is given as [τ, h], so τ is the left end (tail), h is the right end (head), since it moves right.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, [h, τ] with h left, τ right, I think.\n\nTo avoid confusion, let's define the position.\n\nAt turn t1=3, for each car, we have head, tail, direction, speed.\n\nFor a car, the span is from min to max position.\n\nBut in the update, for left-moving, head is at h, tail at τ, and since moving left, head is left of tail? That might be messy.\n\nFrom the span definition:\n\nFor left-moving car: at t1, span is [h, τ], meaning from h to τ, and since moving left, h decreases over time.\n\nIn the input, for k=1, (60,49,right,4), and direction right, so for right-moving, span at t1 should be [τ, h] = [49, 60]? But it says (head, tail) = (60,49), so head=60, tail=49.\n\nFor right-moving, span(t1) = [tail, head] = [49, 60]\n\nThen at time T, span(T) = [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] = [49 + 4ΔT, 60 + 4ΔT]\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, span(t1) = [h, τ] = [head, tail], and at T, [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT]\n\nIn k=2, it's (-24,-1,left,24), so head=-24, tail=-1? But for left-moving, head should be the front when moving left, so if moving left, head is left, tail is right.\n\nIn span [h, τ], with h head, τ tail, for left-moving, h < τ since moving left.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving, tail < head.\n\nIn k=1, (60,49,right,4), 49<60, so tail=49, head=60.\n\nIn k=2, (-24,-1,left,24), head=-24, tail=-1, -24 < -1, so for left-moving, head is left.\n\nNow, collision if at turn T, player on y=k, and 0 is in the span of a car on freeway k at that turn.\n\nSince multiple cars on a freeway, if any car has 0 in span, collision.\n\nNow, ΔT = T - t1 = T - 3.\n\nT is the turn number, starting from t1=3.\n\nNow, let's list for each freeway the car spans as function of T.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: k=1, cars: (60,49,right,4) and (12,1,right,4)\n\nFor first car: span at T: [49 + 4(T-3), 60 + 4(T-3)]\n\nSimplify: [49 + 4T -12, 60 + 4T -12] = [37 + 4T, 48 + 4T]\n\nSimilarly, second car: (12,1,right,4), span at T: [1 + 4(T-3), 12 + 4(T-3)] = [1 + 4T -12, 12 + 4T -12] = [-11 + 4T, 4T]\n\n4T - 11 to 4T, but since it's positions, can be negative or large.\n\nNow, 0 in span for freeway 1 if for either car, min <= 0 <= max.\n\nFor car1: 37 + 4T <= 0 <= 48 + 4T\n\nSince 37+4T <=0 and 0<=48+4T, but 37+4T <=0 implies T <= -37/4 = -9.25, but T >=3, so impossible. 37+4T >= 37+12=49>0 for T>=3, so min=37+4T >0, so 0 not in [37+4T, 48+4T] for T>=3.\n\nSimilarly, max=48+4T>0, min>0, so 0 not covered.\n\nNow car2: min = -11 +4T, max=4T\n\n0 in span if min <=0 and max>=0, so -11+4T <=0 and 4T >=0.\n\n4T>=0 always for T>=0.\n\n-11+4T <=0 implies 4T <=11, T<=11/4=2.75\n\nSince T integer, T<=2.\n\nBut T>=3, so for T>=3, -11+4T >= -11+12=1>0? T=3, -11+12=1>0, min=1>0, so min>0, thus 0 not <= max? min= -11+4T, at T=3, min= -11+12=1, max=4*3=12, so [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSince min increases with T, for T>=3, min >=1 >0, so 0 not in span.\n\nThus for freeway 1, no car ever covers 0 for T>=3. So freeway 1 is always safe? Let me confirm.\n\nT=3: car2 min= -11+12=1, max=12, 1 to 12, 0 not in.\n\nT=4: min= -11+16=5, max=16, etc. all min>0. So yes, freeway 1 has no collision at 0 for any T>=3. So safe to be on y=1 at any time.\n\nBut we need to check for all freeways.\n\nNow freeway 2: k=2, car: (-24,-1,left,24)\n\nDirection left, so span at t1: [h, τ] = [-24, -1]? head=-24, tail=-1.\n\nFor left-moving, span(t1) = [h, τ] = [-24, -1]\n\nThen at T, span(T) = [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT] = [-24 - 24(T-3), -1 - 24(T-3)]\n\nSimplify: let ΔT = T-3, so [ -24 -24ΔT, -1 -24ΔT ] = [ -24(1 + ΔT), -1 -24ΔT ]\n\nSince ΔT >=0, this span is decreasing.\n\n0 in span if min <=0 <= max.\n\nmin = -24 -24ΔT, max = -1 -24ΔT\n\nSince both negative for ΔT>=0, min < max <0, so 0 > max, not in span. min <=0 always since negative, but max = -1 -24ΔT <= -1 <0, so 0 not <= max, thus 0 not in span for any T.\n\nAt T=3, ΔT=0, span=[-24,-1], both negative, 0 not in.\n\nAs T increases, both decrease, more negative, so always negative, 0 not covered.\n\nThus freeway 2 is always safe. No collision at 0.\n\nNow freeway 3: k=3, car: (60,25,right,36)\n\nRight-moving, so span at t1: [τ, h] = [25, 60]\n\nAt T: [25 + 36ΔT, 60 + 36ΔT] with ΔT=T-3\n\nmin = 25 + 36(T-3) = 25 + 36T - 108 = 36T - 83\n\nmax = 60 + 36(T-3) = 60 + 36T - 108 = 36T - 48\n\n0 in span if min <=0 <= max\n\nSo 36T - 83 <= 0 and 0 <= 36T - 48\n\nFirst, 0 <= 36T - 48 ⇒ 36T >=48 ⇒ T >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈1.333, so for T>=2\n\nSecond, 36T -83 <=0 ⇒ 36T <=83 ⇒ T <= 83/36 ≈ 2.305, so T<=2 since integer.\n\nT<=2 and T>=2, so T=2.\n\nBut T=2 is before t1=3? T is turn, t1=3, so for T=2, but we start from T=3, so for T>=3, 36T-83 >= 36*3-83=108-83=25>0? min=36T-83, at T=3: 108-83=25>0, max=108-48=60>0, so min>0, 0 not in span.\n\nSimilarly for T>3, min larger. So no, for T>=3, min >=25>0, so 0 not covered. Safe.\n\nT=2: min=36*2-83=72-83=-11, max=72-48=24, so -11<=0<=24, yes, 0 in span at T=2. But T=2 < t1=3, so not relevant for us since we start at T=3.\n\nSo for T>=3, freeway 3 safe.\n\nNow freeway 4: k=4, car: (-36,-47,right,12)\n\n(-36,-47,right,12)\n\nRight-moving, so span at t1: [τ, h] = [-47, -36]? tail=-47, head=-36.\n\nSince τ is tail, h is head, and for right-moving, tail < head, -47 < -36, yes.\n\nSpan at T: [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] = [-47 + 12ΔT, -36 + 12ΔT]\n\nΔT = T-3\n\nmin = -47 + 12(T-3) = -47 + 12T -36 = 12T -83\n\nmax = -36 + 12(T-3) = -36 +12T -36 = 12T -72\n\n0 in span if min <=0 <= max\n\nSo 12T -83 <=0 and 0 <= 12T -72\n\nFirst: 0 <= 12T -72 ⇒ 12T >=72 ⇒ T >= 6\n\nSecond: 12T -83 <=0 ⇒ 12T <=83 ⇒ T <= 83/12 ≈ 6.916, so T<=6\n\nT>=6 and T<=6, so T=6.\n\nAt T=6, min=12*6 -83=72-83=-11, max=72-72=0? 12T-72=72-72=0, so span=[-11,0]\n\nmin=-11<=0, max=0<=0? 0 <= max is 0<=0, which is true if we consider inclusive.\n\nTypically span [min,max] includes endpoints, I assume.\n\nSo at T=6, min=-11<=0, max=0>=0, so 0 is in span, specifically max=0.\n\nSo collision at T=6 on freeway 4 if player is there.\n\nFor other T, not.\n\nNow freeway 5: k=5, car: (-36,-47,right,12) same as freeway 4.\n\nInput: for k=5, (-36,-47,right,12), identical to k=4.\n\nSo same as above: 0 in span only at T=6.\n\nmin=12T-83, max=12T-72, at T=6, min=72-83=-11, max=72-72=0, so [ -11, 0], 0 included.\n\nNow freeway 6: k=6, car: (-36,-47,right,12) again same as k=4 and k=5.\n\nInput: all three have same car? k=4,5,6 all have (-36,-47,right,12)\n\nBut freeway 6 has this car, and no other? Let's see the table.\n\nIn the input:\n\n| Freeway k | Cars |\n\n| 1 | ... |\n\n| 2 | ... |\n\n| 3 | ... |\n\n| 4 | (-36,-47,right,12) |\n\n| 5 | (-36,-47,right,12) |  same as 4\n\n| 6 | (-36,-47,right,12) | same\n\n| 7 | (60,25,right,36) |\n\n| 8 | (60,49,right,4), (24,13,right,4), (-12,-23,right,4) |\n\nFor k=6, it's (-36,-47,right,12), so yes, same as k=4 and k=5.\n\nSo for freeway 6, also 0 in span at T=6 only.\n\nNow freeway 7: k=7, car: (60,25,right,36)\n\nSimilar to freeway 3.\n\nRight-moving, span at t1: [τ, h] = [25,60]\n\nAt T: [25 + 36ΔT, 60 + 36ΔT] = [25 + 36(T-3), 60 + 36(T-3)] = [36T - 108 +25, 36T -108 +60] = [36T -83, 36T -48]\n\nSame as freeway 3.\n\n0 in span if 36T-83 <=0 and 0<=36T-48\n\nT>= 48/36=4/3≈1.33, T>=2\n\nT<=83/36≈2.305, T<=2\n\nSo only T=2, before t1=3, so for T>=3, min=36T-83 >=36*3-83=108-83=25>0, so safe, no collision.\n\nNow freeway 8: k=8, cars: (60,49,right,4), (24,13,right,4), (-12,-23,right,4)\n\nThree cars.\n\nFirst car: (60,49,right,4), span at T: [49 +4(T-3), 60+4(T-3)] = [49+4T-12, 60+4T-12] = [37+4T, 48+4T]\n\nAs before, min=37+4T >=37+12=49>0 for T>=3, so 0 not covered.\n\nSecond car: (24,13,right,4), span at T: [13 +4(T-3), 24+4(T-3)] = [13+4T-12, 24+4T-12] = [1+4T, 12+4T]\n\nmin=1+4T >=1+12=13>0 for T>=3, max larger, so min>0, 0 not covered.\n\nThird car: (-12,-23,right,4), span at t1: [τ, h] = [-23, -12]\n\nAt T: [-23 +4(T-3), -12 +4(T-3)] = [-23 +4T -12, -12 +4T -12] = [4T -35, 4T -24]\n\n0 in span if min <=0 <= max\n\nmin = 4T -35, max = 4T -24\n\nSo 4T-35 <=0 and 0 <= 4T-24\n\nFirst: 4T-35 <=0 ⇒ 4T <=35 ⇒ T <= 35/4 = 8.75, T<=8\n\nSecond: 0 <= 4T-24 ⇒ 4T >=24 ⇒ T>=6\n\nSo T>=6 and T<=8, so T=6,7,8\n\nAt these times, 0 is in span for this car on freeway 8.\n\nNow summarize for each freeway when collision at 0 occurs:\n\n- y=1: never for T>=3\n\n- y=2: never\n\n- y=3: never for T>=3\n\n- y=4: at T=6\n\n- y=5: at T=6\n\n- y=6: at T=6\n\n- y=7: never\n\n- y=8: at T=6,7,8 (from third car)\n\ny=8 has collision at T=6,7,8.\n\nNow, player starts at turn T=3, position y=0.\n\nWe need to reach y=9, which is safe.\n\nThe minimal H might be small, but we need to avoid being on a freeway when collision happens.\n\nSpecifically, for y=4,5,6: unsafe only at T=6\n\nFor y=8: unsafe at T=6,7,8\n\ny=1,2,3,7 always safe for T>=3.\n\ny=0 and y=9 always safe.\n\nNow, player can move U, D, S each turn, changing y by +1, -1, or 0.\n\nStart at T=3, y=0.\n\nAfter each action, y changes, and at the start of the turn, we have y_T, and we check collision if y_T between 1 and 8 and 0 in car span for that y at T.\n\nThe sequence: at turn T, we choose action a_T, which determines y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy, but collision is based on y_T at turn T.\n\nLet's clarify the timing.\n\nAt the beginning of turn T, player is at position (0, y_T).\n\nThen we choose action a_T.\n\nThen, after action, player moves to (0, y_{T+1}), where y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy based on a_T.\n\nBut the collision check is at the start of the turn, before action? Or after?\n\nFrom the problem:\n\n\"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd y_T is the vertical position at turn T.\n\nNow, when is y_T defined? At turn T, the player is at (0, y_T), and then we apply action to get to next position.\n\nBut the collision is based on y_T at that turn.\n\nAlso, the note: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but not Span(T+1).\"\n\nThis implies that at turn T, you are on y_T, and collision is checked against cars on y_T at turn T.\n\nThen after action, you move to y_{T+1} for turn T+1.\n\nSo yes, for each turn T, given y_T, if 1<= y_T <=8, check if 0 in car span for that freeway at turn T.\n\nIf yes, collision.\n\nOtherwise, safe.\n\nThen apply action to get y_{T+1}.\n\nStart at T=3, y_3 = 0, which is safe.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 for some turn.\n\nSince we start at y=0, and need to go to y=9, minimal moves would be 9 up actions, but we might need to wait or go down to avoid collisions.\n\nBut with collisions, we need to avoid being on certain y at certain T.\n\nThe dangerous times are T=6 for y=4,5,6; and T=6,7,8 for y=8.\n\nSince y=4,5,6 are only unsafe at T=6, we can be there at other times.\n\nSimilarly, y=8 unsafe at T=6,7,8, so we can be there before T=6 or after T=8.\n\nT=6,7,8 are three turns.\n\nNow, let's think about the path.\n\nWe need to go from y=0 to y=9.\n\nPossible to go directly up, but need to check when we cross each y.\n\nSince y changes by at most 1 per turn, we will visit intermediate y values.\n\nFor example, to go from 0 to 9, we must pass through y=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 at some point, but not necessarily all if we move fast, but since min change is 0, we might skip some if we move multiple, but no, each move changes y by at most 1, so from 0 to 9, we need at least 9 turns to increase y by 9, but we can stay or go down, so H >=9.\n\nMinimal H is 9 if we go up every turn.\n\nBut we might have to avoid certain positions at certain times.\n\nStart at T=3, y=0.\n\nAfter actions, y at each turn.\n\nLet t be the turn number relative to start, but better to use absolute T.\n\nSet T from 3 onwards.\n\nWe need to define y_T for T=3,4,5,... up to some T where y_T=9.\n\nH is the number of turns, so from T=3 to T=3+H-1, with y_{3+H-1} =9.\n\nFor example, if H=9, then at T=11, y=9? Let's see.\n\nAt turn T=3, y=0.\n\nAfter one action (t=0), at end of turn, y_{4} = y_3 + Δy.\n\nPerhaps better to think of the state at start of each turn.\n\nAt start of turn T, y_T is fixed, we choose a_T, then y_{T+1} = y_T + a_T effect.\n\nBut for collision, at each turn T, we care about y_T and the cars at T.\n\nNow, for the sequence, we need to output actions for turns starting from t1=3.\n\nNow, let's list the unsafe (y,T) pairs:\n\nFrom above:\n\n- (4,6)\n\n- (5,6)\n\n- (6,6)\n\n- (8,6), (8,7), (8,8)\n\nThat's all.\n\ny=1,2,3,7 are always safe for T>=3.\n\ny=4,5,6 safe except at T=6.\n\ny=8 safe except at T=6,7,8.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nOne way is to go up as fast as possible.\n\nStart T=3, y=0, safe.\n\nChoose U, then y_4 =1\n\nT=4, y=1, which is freeway 1, but we saw it's always safe, so no collision.\n\nChoose U, y_5=2\n\nT=5, y=2, freeway 2, always safe, no collision.\n\nChoose U, y_6=3\n\nT=6, y=3, freeway 3, always safe, no collision.\n\nBut at T=6, we are at y=3.\n\nNow, if we choose U, y_7=4\n\nBut at T=7, y=4, and T=7.\n\nIs y=4 unsafe? From above, y=4 unsafe only at T=6, but T=7, so should be safe.\n\ny=4: unsafe only at T=6, so at T=7, safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=5 unsafe only T=6, y=6 unsafe only T=6.\n\ny=8 unsafe at T=6,7,8.\n\nSo at T=7, y=4 should be safe.\n\nContinue.\n\nT=6: y=3, safe, choose U, then y_7=4\n\nT=7: y=4, now T=7, not 6, so safe for y=4. Since unsafe only at T=6.\n\nChoose U, y_8=5\n\nT=8: y=5, T=8, not 6, so safe.\n\nChoose U, y_9=6\n\nT=9: y=6, T=9, not 6, safe.\n\nChoose U, y_10=7\n\nT=10: y=7, freeway 7, always safe.\n\nChoose U, y_11=8\n\nT=11: y=8, now T=11.\n\ny=8 unsafe at T=6,7,8, but T=11>8, so safe? T=6,7,8 unsafe, T=11 not in that range, so safe.\n\nThen choose U, y_12=9\n\nT=12: y=9, which is not freeway, safe, and we reached.\n\nBut we reached at T=12, which is turn 12.\n\nH: from T=3 to T=12, y_12=9.\n\nNumber of actions: from T=3 to T=11, actions at T=3 to T=11, 9 actions, H=9 turns? Let's see.\n\nTurns: at start T=3, after 0 actions, y=0.\n\nAfter first action (at T=3), y_4 set.\n\nAfter second action (at T=4), y_5 set, and so on.\n\nAfter k actions, y_{3+k} is set.\n\nTo have y_T =9 for some T.\n\nWe start at T=3, y_3=0.\n\nAfter H actions, we have y_{3+H} =9.\n\nThe last action is at turn 3+H-1, setting y_{3+H} to 9.\n\nAnd at that turn, if y_{3+H}=9, no collision since not freeway.\n\nIn the sequence, we have actions from turn t1 to t1+H-1, and after H actions, at turn t1+H, y=9.\n\nIn this case, t1=3, after H actions, at turn 3+H, y=9.\n\nIn my sequence: after 9 actions, at T=12, y=9.\n\nActions at turns T=3 to T=11.\n\nH=9.\n\nBut we might do it faster.\n\nIn the above, I went up every turn from T=3 to T=11, reaching y=9 at T=12.\n\nBut at T=6, I was at y=3, which is fine.\n\nCould I reach earlier?\n\nMinimal H: since from y=0 to y=9, must increase by 9, each U increases by 1, S or D don't help, so min H=9, with 9 ups.\n\nIs that possible? Only if we can be on each freeway at safe times.\n\nIn the above sequence, I was on:\n\nT=4: y=1, safe\n\nT=5: y=2, safe\n\nT=6: y=3, safe\n\nT=7: y=4, safe (since T=7≠6)\n\nT=8: y=5, safe (T=8≠6)\n\nT=9: y=6, safe (T=9≠6)\n\nT=10: y=7, safe\n\nT=11: y=8, safe (T=11>8)\n\nT=12: y=9, safe\n\nAll safe, so with H=9, it works.\n\nBut at T=11, y=8, T=11, which is after T=8, so not in unsafe times.\n\nUnsafe for y=8 is T=6,7,8, so T=11 is fine.\n\nNow, could I reach earlier? For example, if I start moving earlier, but I start at T=3, y=0.\n\nIf I go up faster, but I have to go through each y, since each step changes by 1, I must be at each integer y at some turn.\n\nThe earliest I can be at y=9 is at T=12, if I go up every turn from T=3 to T=11.\n\nAt T=3, y=0, after U, T=4 y=1; ... after U at T=11, T=12 y=9.\n\nSo T=12 is earliest possible.\n\nBut is there a way to be at y=9 at an earlier turn? For example, if I was higher at start, but I start at y=0.\n\nPerhaps I can stay or go down to avoid, but in this case, no need, since the above works.\n\nBut let's confirm if at T=6, when I was at y=3, it is safe, yes.\n\nAnother thing: at T=6, if I were on y=4,5,6, it would be unsafe, but I was on y=3.\n\nSimilarly, for y=8, I avoided T=6,7,8.\n\nIn this sequence, I was on y=8 at T=11, which is fine.\n\nBut could I be on y=8 earlier? For example, if I go up faster.\n\nFrom start, at T=3, y=0.\n\nIf I go U at T=3, y4=1\n\nU at T=4, y5=2\n\nU at T=5, y6=3\n\nU at T=6, y7=4\n\nBut at T=6, y=3, safe.\n\nTo be at y=8 earlier, say at T=10.\n\nT=10 y=8.\n\nBut y=8 at T=10: T=10>8, safe, but I reach later.\n\nEarliest y=8: if I go up every turn, at T=3 y=0, T=4 y=1, T=5 y=2, T=6 y=3, T=7 y=4, T=8 y=5, T=9 y=6, T=10 y=7, T=11 y=8, T=12 y=9.\n\nSo y=8 at T=11.\n\nIf I want y=8 at T=10, that would require y=8 at start of T=10, meaning after action at T=9, y10=8.\n\nBut at T=9, I need to be at y=7 or something.\n\nBut from above, to reach y=8 at T=10, I need to be at y=7 at T=9, and go U.\n\nBut at T=9, y=7 is safe.\n\nThen at T=10, y=8, but T=10, which is after 8, safe.\n\nThen go U to y=9 at T=11.\n\nBut I reach y=9 at T=11, which is earlier than T=12.\n\nHow?\n\nStart T=3 y=0\n\nAction U at T=3: y4=1\n\nT=4: y=1, U, y5=2\n\nT=5: y=2, U, y6=3\n\nT=6: y=3, U, y7=4\n\nT=7: y=4, U, y8=5\n\nT=8: y=5, U, y9=6\n\nT=9: y=6, U, y10=7? y10=7\n\nAt T=9, y=6, go U, then y10=7\n\nBut y=7 at T=10? No.\n\nAt start T=9, y=6, choose U, then y_{10} =7\n\nThen at T=10, y=7, choose U, y_{11}=8\n\nThen T=11, y=8, choose U, y_{12}=9\n\nTo reach y=9 earlier, I need to be at higher y faster.\n\nFor example, at T=3 y=0, if I could be at y=1 at T=3, but I start at y=0.\n\nThe position at each turn is fixed at start.\n\nAt T=3, y=0.\n\nAfter action, y4.\n\nThe earliest to reach y=9 is at T=12 with 9 ups.\n\nSince each U increases y by 1, and start from 0, after k ups, y= k at turn 3+k.\n\nSet y_{3+k} = k for k=0 to 9? At T=3, y=0, which is after 0 actions.\n\nAfter 1 action (at T=3), y4=1\n\nAfter 2 actions, y5=2\n\n...\n\nAfter m actions, y_{3+m} = m\n\nSet equal to 9, so m=9, y_{12}=9.\n\nThus minimal possible is at T=12 with 9 up actions.\n\nAnd in the sequence above, it avoids all collisions, as we checked.\n\nBut in the sequence, at T=11, y=8, which is safe since T=11 not 6,7,8.\n\nT=11 >8.\n\nNow, but in freeway 8, unsafe at T=6,7,8, so T=11 is fine.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nBut is there a problem with y=4,5,6 at T=6? In my sequence, at T=6, I was at y=3, not 4,5,6.\n\nAt T=7, y=4, T=7≠6, safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nBut let me confirm the freeway 8 at T=6,7,8.\n\nFor example, at T=6, if I were on y=8, collision.\n\nBut I am not.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, but in the car state, for freeway 8, at T=6,7,8, the third car covers 0.\n\nBut since I avoid being on y=8 at those times, fine.\n\nNow, but in my sequence, I have H=9, actions from T=3 to T=11, all U.\n\nBut the problem is to output the actions.\n\nBut let me see if I can do with less than 9 turns? No, because must increase y by 9.\n\nUnless I start from higher, but I start at 0.\n\nPerhaps I can go down and up, but that would take more turns, not less.\n\nSo H=9 is minimal.\n\nBut is it possible? In this case, yes, with the sequence.\n\nBut let me double-check the collision points.\n\nAnother thing: at T=6, for y=4,5,6, unsafe, but I am at y=3.\n\nAt T=7, y=4, which is safe since T=7≠6.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow for y=8, I am at y=8 at T=11, which is safe.\n\nBut T=11 is after T=8.\n\nNow, is there any other constraint?\n\nWhat about freeway 7? Always safe, fine.\n\nIn the beginning, I thought freeway 1 and 2 are safe, but let me confirm for y=1 at some T.\n\nFor example, at T=4, y=1, freeway 1, cars: as I computed, min position >0, so 0 not covered, safe.\n\nSimilarly all.\n\nBut in freeway 1, there was a car with span at T: [-11+4T, 4T], at T=3, [-11+12,12]=[1,12], min=1>0.\n\nAt T=4, [5,16], etc.\n\nAll good.\n\nSo the sequence should work.\n\nBut the player needs to reach (0,9), which is at y=9.\n\nIn the sequence, with all U:\n\nTurn T=3: action U, then y4=1\n\nT=4: U, y5=2\n\nT=5: U, y6=3\n\nT=6: U, y7=4\n\nT=7: U, y8=5\n\nT=8: U, y9=6\n\nT=9: U, y10=7\n\nT=10: U, y11=8? y11=8? Let's list y at each turn.\n\nAt start T=3: y=0\n\nAfter action at T=3 (U): y4=1\n\nT=4: y=1, action U: y5=2\n\nT=5: y=2, action U: y6=3\n\nT=6: y=3, action U: y7=4\n\nT=7: y=4, action U: y8=5\n\nT=8: y=5, action U: y9=6\n\nT=9: y=6, action U: y10=7\n\nT=10: y=7, action U: y11=8\n\nT=11: y=8, action U: y12=9\n\nAt T=12, y=9, which is the goal.\n\nNow, we need to reach at some turn, and H is the number of actions, which is from T=3 to T=11, 9 actions.\n\nThe sequence of actions is for turns t1 to t1+H-1, so turns 3 to 11.\n\nAnd y at turn t1+H = 3+9=12 is 9.\n\nIn the output, we need to list actions for each turn starting from t1.\n\nIn this case, all actions are U.\n\nBut is there a reason to do otherwise? For example, if I had to avoid being somewhere, but in this case, not.\n\nBut let me see if at T=6, when I am at y=3, it is freeway 3, which has a car, but we said it's safe.\n\nFreeway 3: car at [36T-83, 36T-48], at T=6: 36*6=216-83=133, 216-48=168, so [133,168], 0 not in, fine.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps I can reach faster by not going through all, but I can't.\n\nAnother thought: but y=9 is the goal, and it might be reached earlier if I start from higher, but I start from 0.\n\nPerhaps I can go down to y=0 and wait, but that would take more turns, not less.\n\nSo minimal H is 9.\n\nBut in the sequence, at T=8, I am at y=5, which is fine.\n\nT=8: y=5, freeway 5.\n\nFreeway 5 has car only unsafe at T=6, but T=8, so safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut for freeway 8, unsafe at T=6,7,8.\n\nAt T=8, if I were on y=8, it would be unsafe.\n\nBut in my sequence, at T=8, I am at y=5, not 8.\n\nAt T=8, y=5, safe.\n\nThen later at T=11, y=8, safe.\n\nNow, but let me confirm the T=8 for freeway 8.\n\nAt T=8, freeway 8, third car: span [4T-35, 4T-24] = [4*8-35, 32-24] = [32-35, 8] = [-3,8]\n\n-3 <=0<=8, so 0 in span, so if on y=8 at T=8, collision.\n\nBut I am not, so fine.\n\nIn my sequence, I avoid it.\n\nNow, but in the output, I need to specify the actions.\n\nBut the answer should be a sequence of U actions.\n\nBut let me see if H can be less. Suppose I use D or S, but that would not help to go up faster, so H cannot be less than 9.\n\nThus minimal H is 9.\n\nBut is there a way to be at y=9 at T=11? That would require y at T=11 to be 9.\n\nBut from start, after 8 actions, y_{11} = ? After m actions, y_{3+m}.\n\nSet y_{3+m} =9, so 3+m=11 implies m=8, y=9, but after 8 actions, y=8? Contradiction.\n\ny_{3+m} = value after m actions.\n\nAt T=3, before actions, y=0.\n\nAfter first action (T=3), y4= y3 + Δy, so if U, y4=1.\n\nAfter second action (T=4), y5= y4 + Δy, and so on.\n\nAfter k actions, y_{3+k} = y3 + sum of Δy up to k actions.\n\nSince y3=0, y_{3+k} = sum of Δy for the first k actions.\n\nTo have y_{3+k} =9, need sum of Δy =9 over k actions.\n\nEach Δy <=1, so k >=9.\n\nThus minimal k=9, with all Δy=1, i.e., all U.\n\nAnd y_{3+9}=y12=9.\n\nSo indeed, minimal H=9, with all U actions.\n\nAnd as per the collision, it works.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's list the y and T:\n\nT=3: y=0, not freeway, safe\n\nT=4: y=1, freeway 1, safe (as computed)\n\nT=5: y=2, freeway 2, safe\n\nT=6: y=3, freeway 3, safe (min car position 25>0)\n\nT=7: y=4, freeway 4, at T=7, car span: min=12*7 -83=84-83=1? For freeway 4, min=12T-83, at T=7: 84-83=1, max=12*7-72=84-72=12, so [1,12], 0 not in, safe.\n\nT=8: y=5, freeway 5, similarly min=12*8-83=96-83=13, max=96-72=24, [13,24], no 0.\n\nT=9: y=6, freeway 6, min=12*9-83=108-83=25, max=108-72=36, [25,36], no 0.\n\nT=10: y=7, freeway 7, min=36*10-83=360-83=277, max=360-48=312, no 0.\n\nT=11: y=8, freeway 8, at T=11, cars: first car min=37+4*11=37+44=81, max=48+44=92, no 0.\n\nSecond car min=1+44=45, max=12+44=56, no.\n\nThird car min=4*11-35=44-35=9, max=44-24=20, [9,20], min=9>0, so 0 not in, safe.\n\nThen T=12: y=9, safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is all U for 9 turns.\n\nNow, for the output.\n\nAnswer format:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1}\n\n...\n\nUp to Turn t_1 + H - 1\n\nWith H=9, t1=3.\n\nSo actions from turn 3 to turn 11.\n\nEach action U.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nIn the sequence, turn t1 + t for t=0 to H-1, so t from 0 to 8? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence is {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\n\nSo for t=0, a_{t1} = a_3\n\nt=1, a_4, ..., up to t=H-1, a_{t1 + H -1}\n\nWith H=9, t from 0 to 8, a_{3} to a_{11}\n\nYes.\n\nAnd each is U.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H\", which is 9.\n\nAnd the sequence.\n\nBut in the output, it should be in the box.\n\nBut is there a shorter path? I don't think so.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=9 faster by being on freeways when safe, but since I have to go through, and min steps, not possible.\n\nSuppose I stay at y=0 for some turns, but that would increase H, worse.\n\nOr go down, worse.\n\nSo yes.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 9 with all U actions.\n\nSo the answer should be:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 3: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 4: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 5: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: U \\end{array} }\n\nIn the format, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc., so I think this is fine.\n\nPerhaps write it as text.\n\nBut in the box, it should be clear.\n\nSince all same, but I think it's ok.\n\nBut in the initial state, player at (0,0), and cars, but I think I covered.\n\nOne thing: in freeway 4,5,6, at T=6, unsafe, but in my path, I am not there at T=6.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nBut just to be sure, is there any other freeway with issue? y=7 is always safe.\n\ny=1,2,3 safe.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 3\\) is 9, as the player must increase the vertical position from 0 to 9, requiring at least 9 upward moves. Each action must be chosen to avoid collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\) at each turn.\n\nThe collision analysis for each freeway at relevant turns shows:\n- Freeways 1, 2, 3, and 7 are always safe for \\(T \\geq 3\\).\n- Freeways 4, 5, and 6 are unsafe only at turn \\(T = 6\\).\n- Freeway 8 is unsafe at turns \\(T = 6, 7, 8\\).\n\nThe sequence of actions that achieves the goal in minimal turns while avoiding collisions is to move up (U) at every turn. This path avoids the unsafe states:\n- At \\(T = 6\\), the player is at \\(y = 3\\) (safe, as freeway 3 is always safe).\n- At \\(T = 7\\), \\(y = 4\\) (safe, as \\(T \\neq 6\\)).\n- At \\(T = 8\\), \\(y = 5\\) (safe, as \\(T \\neq 6\\)).\n- At \\(T = 9\\), \\(y = 6\\) (safe, as \\(T \\neq 6\\)).\n- At \\(T = 11\\), \\(y = 8\\) (safe, as \\(T = 11 > 8\\)).\n\nThe actions are applied from turn \\(t_1 = 3\\) to turn \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 11\\), resulting in position \\((0, 9)\\) at turn 12.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 3: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 4: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 5: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: U \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>We are given the current turn t1 = 4 and the player starts at (0,1). The goal is to reach (0,9) in minimal turns H, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways (y=1 to 8) at the moment when the player is on that freeway.\n\nImportant note: Collision occurs at turn T only if at that turn the player is on a freeway k (which is the y-coordinate) and the car on that freeway has a span that includes 0 at turn T.\n\nAlso note: When the player moves (U or D) at turn T, then at turn T they are still on the old row. At the next turn (T+1) they will be on the new row. Therefore, at the moment of the move (turn T) they are only at risk on the current row (y_T) and not on the row they are moving to (y_{T+1}).\n\nWe have 8 freeways (rows 1 to 8). Each freeway has one or more cars. Each car is defined by (head, tail, direction, speed). Note that the direction is either left or right, and the movement is continuous (the car spans move by s per turn in the given direction).\n\nWe are to output a sequence of actions starting at turn t1 (which is 4) until we reach row 9.\n\nApproach:\n1. We need to simulate the movement of the cars over time. Since the cars move at constant speeds and the grid is infinite in the x-direction (but we only care about x=0), we can compute when a car's span covers x=0.\n\n2. For each freeway k and for each car on that freeway, we can compute the time intervals (in terms of turns) during which the car covers x=0. However, note that the problem states that a collision occurs at turn T if at that turn the car's span includes 0. So we need to know for each freeway k and for each turn T, whether there is at least one car on freeway k that has 0 in its span at turn T.\n\n3. But note: the cars are moving continuously. For a left-moving car: \n   - The span at time T (relative to t1) is [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)] \n   - But note: the initial state at t1 is given. For a left-moving car, the head is at h and tail at τ? Actually, the table says for left-moving: \n        \"Span(t1) = [h, τ] -> Span(T) = [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]\"\n   However, observe the example: for freeway 2: (-48,-25,left,24). At t1=4, the span is [h, τ] = [-48, -25]? But that would be from -48 to -25 (which is a segment of length 23). Then at a future time T, the entire segment moves left by s*(T-t1) per the rule? Actually, the rule says for left-moving: \n        Span(T) = [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]\n   But note: if the car is moving left, then the entire segment should shift left (so the head becomes more negative). However, the representation of the car: the head is the front? Actually, the problem states for left-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, τ]\" and then moves to [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]. This implies that the head h is the leading part? But in a left-moving car, if the car is moving left, then the front is the leftmost part? Actually, the problem does not specify. But note the example: \n        freeway 1: (-48, -59, right, 4) -> wait, here head=-48 and tail=-59? and direction right? That would be odd because -48 is greater than -59, so if moving right the head should be the rightmost? \n\nLet me reinterpret the table:\n\nThe table for freeway 1 has two cars: \n   (-48, -59, right, 4) and (16,5,right,4)\n\nFor a right-moving car, the rule says: \n   \"Span(t1) = [τ, h] -> Span(T) = [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\"\n\nSo for the first car: at t1=4, the span is [τ, h] = [-59, -48] (because τ is tail and h is head). So the car is from -59 to -48 (length 11). And it is moving right. So at time T, the car is from [-59 + 4*(T-4), -48 + 4*(T-4)].\n\nSimilarly, the second car: [5,16] at t1=4? But the table says (16,5,right,4). Then according to the rule: [τ, h] = [5,16]? But the table says head=16, tail=5? So the car is from 5 to 16 (length 11) and moves right.\n\nBut wait, the problem says for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\" meaning that τ is the tail (left end) and h is the head (right end). So the representation in the table is (head, tail, direction, speed) for a right-moving car? Actually, the table says \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\".\n\nSo for a right-moving car, the head is the rightmost and tail is the leftmost. For a left-moving car, the head is the leftmost and tail is the rightmost? But the rule for left-moving says: \"Span(t1) = [h, τ]\" meaning that h is the leftmost (head) and τ is the rightmost (tail). \n\nSo in the table, for a car: (head, tail, direction, speed) is given.\n\nTherefore, for freeway 2: (-48,-25,left,24) -> head=-48 (leftmost), tail=-25 (rightmost). The car spans from -48 to -25 (length 23) and moves left. So at time T, the car spans from [ -48 - 24*(T-4), -25 - 24*(T-4) ].\n\nNow, we are only concerned with the x=0 position. We need to know for each freeway k and for each turn T (starting at t1=4 and going forward) whether there is a car on freeway k that covers 0 at turn T.\n\nLet me define:\n   For a car on freeway k: \n      Let t0 = 4 (the starting turn)\n\n   For a right-moving car (d='right'): \n        The car covers 0 at time T if and only if:\n            τ + s*(T-t0) <= 0 <= h + s*(T-t0)\n        =>  0 is in [τ + s*(T-t0), h + s*(T-t0)]\n\n   For a left-moving car (d='left'):\n        The car covers 0 at time T if and only if:\n            h - s*(T-t0) <= 0 <= τ - s*(T-t0)\n        =>  0 is in [h - s*(T-t0), τ - s*(T-t0)]\n\nBut note: the problem says that at turn T, the player is on freeway k (if the player's y-coordinate at turn T is k) and then if there is a car on freeway k that has 0 in its span at T, then collision.\n\nWe must avoid being on a freeway k at turn T if any car on that freeway covers 0 at T.\n\nThe player starts at (0,1) at turn 4. The goal is to get to (0,9). The player can move up (U: y+1), down (D: y-1), or stay (S: y unchanged). Note that y is bounded between 0 and 9.\n\nWe are to find the minimal H and a sequence of actions.\n\nWe can use BFS (breadth-first search) over the state (turn, y) to find the minimal turns to reach y=9. However, note that the turn number can be large? But the cars are periodic? Actually, the cars are moving at constant speeds and the grid is infinite, but the pattern of when a freeway is blocked at x=0 is periodic? However, the periods might be different for each car. But note: the speeds are integers, so the pattern for a single car is periodic with period (length of the car) / gcd? Actually, the condition for a car to cover 0 is linear in T.\n\nAlternatively, we can precompute for each freeway k the set of turns (relative to t0=4) at which the freeway is blocked. However, since the cars move continuously and the condition is linear, the set of blocked turns for a freeway might be a union of arithmetic progressions? Actually, it's a union of intervals? Because the car covers 0 for a contiguous set of turns? \n\nLet me check:\n\nFor a right-moving car: \n   Condition: τ + s*(T-4) <= 0 <= h + s*(T-4)\n   => (0 - h) / s <= T-4 <= (0 - τ) / s\n\n   But note: since the car has a fixed length, the condition is a continuous interval of T.\n\n   Specifically, the car covers 0 from T1 to T2 where:\n        T1 = 4 + ceil( (0 - h) / s )   ??? Actually, we have to be careful: the car covers 0 from the moment the left end (τ) passes 0 to the moment the right end (h) passes 0? Actually, the car covers 0 from when the left end is <=0 and the right end >=0 until the left end moves beyond 0? But actually, the condition is:\n\n        τ + s*(T-4) <= 0   => T >= 4 + (0 - τ) / s   [if s>0] but note: if s>0, then as T increases the car moves right. The left end (τ) moves right. So the car starts covering 0 when the left end becomes <=0? Actually, the car covers 0 when the left end is <=0 and the right end is >=0.\n\n        Similarly, when the left end becomes >0, then the car no longer covers 0? Actually, the condition is: \n            τ + s*(T-4) <= 0   => T <= 4 + (0 - τ) / s   ??? \n\n        Actually, solving the inequalities:\n\n        τ + s*(T-4) <= 0   => T-4 <= (0 - τ)/s   => T <= 4 + (0 - τ)/s   [if s>0, then the inequality direction remains]\n\n        and \n        h + s*(T-4) >= 0   => T-4 >= (0 - h)/s   => T >= 4 + ceil((0 - h)/s) ??? \n\n        But note: we are in integers? The problem does not say the positions are integers? Actually, the initial head and tail are integers, and the speed is integer, so the positions at integer turns are integers. Therefore, the condition is:\n\n        For a right-moving car, the car covers 0 at T (an integer) if:\n            (0 - h) is divisible by s? Not exactly. We require:\n\n            τ + s*(T-4) <= 0 <= h + s*(T-4)\n\n        Rearranged:\n            (0 - h) / s <= T-4 <= (0 - τ) / s\n\n        Since T is integer, we can write:\n\n            T-4 >= ceil( (0 - h) / s )   and T-4 <= floor( (0 - τ) / s )\n\n        But note: because the car moves continuously and we are sampling at integer turns, we can use:\n\n            T_min = ceil( (0 - h) / s + 4 )   ??? \n\n        Actually, let me do:\n\n            Let d = T-4.\n\n            Then we require:\n                τ + s*d <= 0   => d <= (0 - τ) / s   -> since d is integer, d <= floor( (0 - τ) / s )   [if s>0, then (0-τ) might be negative?]\n\n        Example: take the first car on freeway 1: (head=-48, tail=-59, right, 4) -> so τ = -59, h = -48.\n\n            Condition: \n                -59 + 4*d <= 0  => 4*d <= 59  => d <= 59/4 = 14.75 -> d <= 14 (since integer)\n                -48 + 4*d >= 0  => 4*d >= 48  => d >= 12\n\n            So d in [12,14] -> T in [4+12, 4+14] = [16,18]\n\n        Similarly, the second car on freeway 1: (head=16, tail=5, right, 4) -> \n            Condition: \n                5 + 4*d <= 0 -> 4*d <= -5 -> d <= -1.25 -> d <= -2? (but d>=0) -> never covers 0? \n            and 16+4*d>=0 -> always true for d>=0. But the left condition fails. So indeed, the second car never covers 0 for T>=4.\n\n        Therefore, freeway 1 is blocked at T=16,17,18.\n\nSimilarly, we can compute for every car and every freeway the intervals of T (from 4 onward) when the freeway is blocked (by at least one car).\n\nBut note: a freeway might have multiple cars, so we take the union of their intervals.\n\nWe are going to simulate the player moving. The state is (t, y) where t is the current turn (starting at t0=4) and y in [0,9]. We want to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nThe actions: U, D, S. Note that if we are at y=0, we cannot go down (but the update rule says y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t and then clamped to [0,9]? Actually, the update rule says: \n    y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, and y_{t+1} in [0,9]\n\nSo if at y=0 and we choose D, then y_{t+1} = 0 - 1 -> but then clamped? The problem says \"y_{t+1} ∈ [0,9]\". So it will be clamped to 0. Similarly, at y=9, if we choose U, we remain at 9.\n\nBut note: the problem does not explicitly say clamping, but the update rule says \"y_{t+1} ∈ [0,9]\". So we can assume that if the move would take it outside, it stays.\n\nHowever, the problem states: \n    y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, and then says y_{t+1} in [0,9]. \n\nSo it's defined to be clamped. We can model the move as:\n    If we choose U: y_{t+1} = min(9, y_t+1)\n    D: y_{t+1} = max(0, y_t-1)\n    S: y_{t+1} = y_t\n\nBut note: the problem says \"y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\" and then \"y_{t+1} ∈ [0,9]\". So we can assume that if the move goes beyond, it is set to the boundary.\n\nNow, the collision condition: at turn t, the player is at (0, y_t). We then check: if y_t is between 1 and 8 (inclusive), then we must check the freeway y_t at turn t: if at turn t, any car on freeway y_t covers x=0, then collision -> invalid state.\n\nBut note: if the player is at y_t=0 or y_t=9, then they are not on a freeway (since freeways are y=1..8) so no collision.\n\nTherefore, the state (t, y) is valid if:\n   - if y in {1,2,...,8}, then at turn t, freeway y is not blocked (i.e., no car on freeway y covers 0 at turn t).\n   - if y=0 or y=9, then no collision (but note: we are trying to get to (0,9), so at the final turn we are at y=9 and that's safe).\n\nWe start at (t0=4, y=1). We must check: at turn 4, freeway 1: we computed above that the first car on freeway1 blocks at T=16,17,18. So at T=4, freeway1 is not blocked? Let me check:\n\n   For the first car on freeway1: at T=4, the car is at [τ + s*0, h + s*0] = [-59, -48] -> does not cover 0.\n   The second car: [5,16] -> doesn't cover 0.\n\nSo at T=4, freeway1 is safe. Therefore, the start state is safe.\n\nWe then simulate the moves. We use BFS (or Dijkstra since all steps cost 1) to find the minimal number of turns to reach y=9.\n\nThe state: (turn, y). The turn number can be large? But note: the minimal path should not take too many turns because we can move at most 8 steps up (from 1 to 9: 8 steps). However, we might have to wait (by staying) to avoid collisions. So the total turns might be more than 8.\n\nWe need to precompute for each freeway k (1..8) the set of turns (from 4 onward) that are blocked.\n\nLet's compute the blocking intervals for each freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: k=1\n   Cars: \n      car1: (-48, -59, right, 4) -> τ=-59, h=-48, s=4, right.\n        Condition: \n            d = T-4\n            -59 + 4*d <= 0 <= -48 + 4*d\n            => 4*d <= 59 -> d <= 14.75 -> d <= 14\n            and 4*d >= 48 -> d>=12\n            => d in [12,14] -> T in [16,18]\n\n      car2: (16,5,right,4) -> τ=5, h=16, s=4\n        Condition:\n            5+4*d <= 0 -> 4*d <= -5 -> d <= -1.25 -> d<=-2 -> no nonnegative d satisfies -> never blocks.\n\n      So freeway1 is blocked at T=16,17,18.\n\nFreeway 2: k=2\n   Car: (-48,-25,left,24) -> head=-48, tail=-25, s=24, left.\n        Condition: \n            h - s*d <= 0 <= τ - s*d\n            => -48 -24*d <= 0 and 0 <= -25 -24*d -> wait, the second inequality: 0<=-25-24*d -> which is impossible for d>=0? \n            Actually, the car moves left: so at d=0, the car is [-48,-25]. Then as d increases, the car moves left (so becomes more negative). Therefore, it never covers 0? \n        Specifically:\n            The condition for 0 to be in [h-24*d, τ-24*d] = [-48-24d, -25-24d]. Since both ends are negative and decreasing, 0 is never in this interval.\n\n        So freeway2 is never blocked.\n\nFreeway 3: k=3\n   Car: (-48,-83,right,36) -> τ=-83, h=-48, s=36, right.\n        Condition:\n            -83 + 36*d <= 0 <= -48 + 36*d\n            => 36*d <= 83 -> d <= 83/36 ≈ 2.305 -> d<=2\n            and 36*d >= 48 -> d>=48/36≈1.333 -> d>=2 (since d must be integer)\n            So d=2: \n                Check: -83+36*2 = -83+72 = -11 <=0 -> true\n                        -48+36*2 = -48+72=24>=0 -> true.\n            Also d=1: \n                -83+36=-47<=0 -> true\n                -48+36=-12<0 -> fails the second condition? \n            So only d=2? \n            Therefore, T = 4+2 = 6.\n\n        So freeway3 is blocked at T=6.\n\nFreeway 4: k=4\n   Car: (-24,-35,right,12) -> τ=-35, h=-24, s=12, right.\n        Condition:\n            -35+12*d<=0<=-24+12*d\n            => 12*d<=35 -> d<=35/12≈2.916 -> d<=2\n            and 12*d>=24 -> d>=2\n            So d=2: \n                -35+24=-11<=0 -> true\n                -24+24=0>=0 -> true.\n            So T=4+2=6.\n\n        Blocked at T=6.\n\nFreeway 5: k=5\n   Same as freeway4: (-24,-35,right,12) -> so also blocked at T=6.\n\nFreeway 6: k=6\n   Same: (-24,-35,right,12) -> blocked at T=6.\n\nFreeway 7: k=7\n   Car: (-48,-83,right,36) -> same as freeway3? \n        Condition: same as freeway3 -> blocked at T=6.\n\nFreeway 8: k=8\n   Cars: \n        car1: (-48,-59,right,4) -> same as the first car on freeway1: blocked at T=16,17,18? \n        car2: (28,17,right,4) -> τ=17, h=28, s=4\n            Condition: \n                17+4*d<=0 -> 4*d<=-17 -> d<=-4.25 -> never (for d>=0) -> safe.\n        car3: (-8,-19,right,4) -> τ=-19, h=-8, s=4\n            Condition:\n                -19+4*d<=0<=-8+4*d\n                => 4*d<=19 -> d<=4.75 -> d<=4\n                and 4*d>=8 -> d>=2\n                => d in [2,4] -> T in [6,8] (because 4+2=6, 4+3=7, 4+4=8)\n\n        Therefore, freeway8 is blocked at:\n            from car1: T=16,17,18\n            from car3: T=6,7,8\n\n        So union: T in {6,7,8,16,17,18}\n\nSummary of blocked freeways by turn:\n\nWe are going to list for each freeway (1 to 8) and for turns starting at 4, which turns are blocked.\n\nFreeway1: {16,17,18}\nFreeway2: never blocked\nFreeway3: {6}\nFreeway4: {6}\nFreeway5: {6}\nFreeway6: {6}\nFreeway7: {6}\nFreeway8: {6,7,8,16,17,18}\n\nNow, we simulate the state (turn, y) starting at (4,1). We want to reach y=9.\n\nWe consider the next state: at turn t+1, the player moves to y' (which is y, y+1, or y-1, clamped to [0,9]). And then we check the state at turn t+1: if the new y' is between 1 and 8, then we check if at turn t+1, freeway y' is blocked? If it is blocked, then we cannot be at that state.\n\nBut note: at the current turn t, we are at y_t. Then we choose an action a_t. Then at turn t+1, we are at y_{t+1}. And we must check the state (t+1, y_{t+1}).\n\nWe start at (4,1) -> safe (freeway1 at turn4: safe).\n\nWe then consider the actions at turn4: U, D, S.\n\nBut note: the goal is to be at (0,9) at the last turn. So we are done when we first reach y=9 at some turn.\n\nWe'll do BFS (queue by turn and y). We record the minimal turn number when we reach y=9.\n\nThe state: (turn, y). We mark visited states? But note: we might come to the same y at a later turn and it might be beneficial if we avoided a collision? However, we are minimizing the turn number, so if we have a state (t,y) and we can get to (t',y) with t'<t, then we don't need to consider the later one. But wait: we might have a state (t,y) that is safe and then we wait (by staying) and then move. So we might have multiple paths to the same (y) at different turns. However, if we have a state (t,y) and we already visited (t,y) with a lower or equal turn, then we skip? Actually, we are doing BFS by increasing turn, so the first time we reach a state (t,y) is the minimal turn for that state.\n\nBut note: we might need to wait at a safe freeway for several turns. So we should allow multiple visits to the same y at different turns? And we mark the state (t,y) as visited. Since the turn t can be large, we must set a bound. However, the minimal path should be within a reasonable number of turns (like at most 20? because we have to avoid the blocked turns at 6,7,8 and 16,17,18).\n\nWe'll do BFS until we find the goal (y=9). We start with turn=4, and then we go to turn=5,6,... until we reach y=9.\n\nSteps:\n\n   We'll use a queue: each element is (turn, y, path) \n   We maintain a visited set: states (turn, y) that we have already expanded.\n\n   Start: (4,1, [])\n\n   Then from (4,1), we can do:\n        a = U: y_next = min(9,1+1)=2 -> state (5,2)\n        a = D: y_next = max(0,1-1)=0 -> state (5,0)\n        a = S: y_next = 1 -> state (5,1)\n\n   Check state (5,2): y=2 (freeway) -> check freeway2 at turn5: freeway2 is never blocked -> safe.\n        Then we add (5,2, [U])\n\n   (5,0): y=0 -> safe. Add (5,0, [D])\n   (5,1): y=1 -> check freeway1 at turn5: freeway1 is blocked at 16,17,18 -> turn5 not blocked -> safe. Add (5,1, [S])\n\n   Then we expand these states.\n\n   We continue until we reach y=9.\n\n   We must avoid states that are blocked.\n\nWe'll do the BFS:\n\nLevel 0 (turn=4): (4,1) -> safe.\n\nLevel 1 (turn=5): \n   (5,0): safe -> then from (5,0): \n        U -> y=1 -> state (6,1): check freeway1 at turn6: freeway1 blocked at 16,17,18 -> turn6 not blocked -> safe? \n        But wait: freeway1 at turn6: not in {16,17,18} -> safe. \n        D -> y=0 (remains 0)\n        S -> y=0 (remains 0)\n\n   (5,1): safe -> then from (5,1):\n        U -> y=2 -> state(6,2): freeway2 always safe -> safe.\n        D -> y=0 -> state(6,0): safe.\n        S -> y=1 -> state(6,1): safe? freeway1 at turn6: safe? -> safe.\n\n   (5,2): safe -> then from (5,2):\n        U -> y=3 -> state(6,3): freeway3 at turn6: blocked! (we have freeway3 blocked at turn6) -> unsafe -> skip.\n        D -> y=1 -> state(6,1): safe (as above)\n        S -> y=2 -> state(6,2): safe.\n\nSo at turn6, we have:\n\n   From (5,0): \n        U -> (6,1) -> safe -> add.\n        D -> (6,0) -> safe -> add.\n        S -> (6,0) -> same as above? Actually, we can do: \n            Actually, we do all actions. But note: we might get multiple ways to same state.\n\n   From (5,1): \n        U -> (6,2) -> safe -> add.\n        D -> (6,0) -> safe -> add.\n        S -> (6,1) -> safe -> add.\n\n   From (5,2):\n        D -> (6,1) -> safe -> add (but we already have (6,1) from two paths)\n        S -> (6,2) -> safe -> add (we already have (6,2) from (5,1)->U)\n\n        And U is unsafe.\n\nSo at turn6, states: (6,0), (6,1), (6,2)\n\nNow, we want to avoid freeways that are blocked at turn6: freeways 3,4,5,6,7,8 are blocked? \n   Specifically:\n        freeway3: blocked at 6 -> so if at turn6 we are on freeway3 (y=3), then unsafe -> we didn't go there.\n        freeway4: blocked at 6 -> y=4: unsafe.\n        freeway5: blocked -> y=5: unsafe.\n        freeway6: blocked -> y=6: unsafe.\n        freeway7: blocked -> y=7: unsafe.\n        freeway8: blocked at 6 -> y=8: unsafe.\n\nBut note: our states at turn6 are only y=0,1,2 -> all safe.\n\nNow, expand turn6:\n\nState (6,0): \n   U -> (7,1): check freeway1 at turn7: safe (only blocked at 16,17,18) -> safe.\n   D -> (7,0): safe.\n   S -> (7,0): same.\n\nState (6,1):\n   U -> (7,2): freeway2: safe.\n   D -> (7,0): safe.\n   S -> (7,1): safe.\n\nState (6,2):\n   U -> (7,3): freeway3 at turn7: blocked only at turn6 -> so turn7 safe? -> safe.\n   D -> (7,1): safe.\n   S -> (7,2): safe.\n\nSo at turn7, we have states: \n   (7,0), (7,1), (7,2), (7,3)\n\nNow, check blocked at turn7: \n   freeway8: blocked at 7 -> so if we are at freeway8 (y=8) at turn7, it's blocked. But we don't have y=8 at turn7.\n\n   freeway1: safe? freeway1 blocked at 16,17,18 -> safe.\n   freeway2: safe.\n   freeway3: safe? only blocked at 6 -> safe.\n   freeway4: blocked at 6 only -> safe at 7.\n   similarly 5,6,7: safe at 7.\n\n   Only freeway8 is blocked at 7? So if we were to go to y=8 at turn7, it would be unsafe. But we don't have that.\n\nExpand turn7:\n\nFor (7,0): \n   U -> (8,1): freeway1 at turn8: safe? -> safe.\n   D -> (8,0): safe.\n   S -> (8,0): same.\n\nFor (7,1):\n   U -> (8,2): freeway2: safe.\n   D -> (8,0): safe.\n   S -> (8,1): safe.\n\nFor (7,2):\n   U -> (8,3): freeway3: safe at turn8 -> safe.\n   D -> (8,1): safe.\n   S -> (8,2): safe.\n\nFor (7,3):\n   U -> (8,4): freeway4: safe at turn8 -> safe.\n   D -> (8,2): safe.\n   S -> (8,3): safe.\n\nAt turn8, we have states: (8,0), (8,1), (8,2), (8,3), (8,4)\n\nBut note: freeway8 is blocked at turn8? Yes! freeway8 is blocked at 6,7,8. So if we are at freeway8 (y=8) at turn8, it's blocked. But we don't have y=8 at turn8.\n\nSo all these states are safe.\n\nNow, we continue:\n\nAt (8,0): \n   U -> (9,1): freeway1 at turn9: safe? freeway1 blocked at 16,17,18 -> safe.\n\nAt (8,1):\n   U -> (9,2): safe.\n\nAt (8,2):\n   U -> (9,3): safe.\n\nAt (8,3):\n   U -> (9,4): safe.\n\nAt (8,4):\n   U -> (9,5): freeway5 at turn9: safe? freeway5 only blocked at turn6 -> safe.\n\nBut note: we are moving towards 9. We are at y=4 at turn8, and we need to get to y=9. We can do multiple U's.\n\nWe can see that from (8,4) we can go U repeatedly until we get to 9. But we must check the turns and the freeways.\n\nHowever, we are not at the goal yet. We need to get to y=9.\n\nBut note: we are at turn8 and we are at y=4. We need 5 more U moves to get to y=9? \n   Actually: \n        turn8: y=4\n        turn9: y=5 (if U)\n        turn10: y=6\n        turn11: y=7\n        turn12: y=8\n        turn13: y=9\n\nBut we must check the freeways for y=5,6,7,8 at turns 9,10,11,12.\n\nWe know:\n   freeway5: blocked only at turn6 -> safe at turn9 and beyond.\n   freeway6: only at turn6 -> safe.\n   freeway7: only at turn6 -> safe.\n   freeway8: blocked at 6,7,8,16,17,18 -> so at turn9: not blocked? \n        turn9: not in {6,7,8,16,17,18} -> safe.\n        turn10: safe? \n        turn11: safe?\n        turn12: safe? -> yes, because 12 is not in the blocked set.\n\nSo we can go from y=4 at turn8 to y=9 at turn13 by doing 5 U's.\n\nBut is that minimal? We started at turn4 and we are at turn13 -> H = 13-4+1? Actually, the sequence of actions starts at turn4 and goes to turn12 (so H=9 actions?).\n\nBut we might find a shorter path.\n\nAlternatively, we might have a path that gets to 9 earlier. For example, if we had moved faster earlier.\n\nBut we started at y=1 at turn4. The minimal number of moves (if no waiting) is 8 moves (from 1 to 9: 8 steps). So the earliest we could arrive is turn4+8 = turn12.\n\nBut at turn12: \n   We need to be at y=9 at turn12. But we must avoid collisions along the way.\n\nWe can try to see if we can get to 9 by turn12.\n\nHow? We need 8 moves up. So we must do 8 U's without waiting.\n\nWe start at (4,1). Then:\n\n   turn4: U -> (5,2) -> safe (freeway2 safe at turn5)\n   turn5: U -> (6,3) -> unsafe! (freeway3 blocked at turn6) -> so we cannot do U at turn5 to get to y=3 at turn6.\n\nSo we must avoid freeway3 at turn6. Therefore, we cannot be at y=3 at turn6.\n\nSo we have to wait somewhere until after turn6? \n\nAlternatively, we might go down to 0? but that would take extra moves.\n\nWe can try to go from 1 to 2 at turn5, then at turn6 we are at 2 (safe) and then at turn7 we go to 3 (safe, since freeway3 only blocked at turn6). Then we can go up.\n\nBut then we are at:\n\n   turn4: U -> (5,2)\n   turn5: S? -> but we are at 2 at turn5, then at turn6 we are at 2 (safe) -> then:\n        turn6: U -> (7,3) -> safe (freeway3 safe at turn7)\n        turn7: U -> (8,4) -> safe (freeway4 safe at turn8)\n        turn8: U -> (9,5) -> safe (freeway5 safe at turn9) ... but we are not at 9 yet.\n\nBut we are at 5 at turn9. Then we need 4 more moves: \n        turn9: U->6\n        turn10: U->7\n        turn11: U->8\n        turn12: U->9\n\nSo we reach at turn12. \n\nBut note: at turn12, we are at y=9 -> safe.\n\nSo total turns: from turn4 to turn12 -> 9 actions? Actually, the actions are from turn4 to turn11 (8 actions of U) and then one more at turn12? \n\nWait, the sequence:\n\n   Turn4: U -> (5,2)\n   Turn5: S (or we could do D? but we did S to wait) -> but we did not wait, we did U at turn6. Actually, we did:\n\n        turn4: U -> (5,2)\n        turn5: ? -> we must avoid being at y=3 at turn6. So we can stay at 2 at turn5? Then at turn5 we are at (5,2). Then at turn6 we are at (6,2) -> safe. Then at turn6 we do U -> (7,3). Then:\n\n        turn7: U -> (8,4)\n        turn8: U -> (9,5)\n        turn9: U -> (10,6)\n        turn10: U -> (11,7)\n        turn11: U -> (12,8)   -> at turn12, we are at y=8 -> then we must check freeway8 at turn12: blocked? \n                freeway8 is blocked at 6,7,8,16,17,18 -> turn12 is not in {6,7,8,16,17,18} -> safe.\n        turn12: U -> (13,9) -> at turn13, we are at y=9.\n\nSo that takes 9 moves? and ends at turn13.\n\nBut we can do without waiting? We started at 1 at turn4. We did:\n\n   turn4: U -> 2\n   turn5: U -> 3 -> but then at turn6 we would be at 3 -> blocked? so we cannot.\n\nAlternatively, we can go down to 0 at turn5? \n\n   turn4: D -> (5,0) -> safe.\n   turn5: U -> (6,1) -> safe (freeway1 safe at turn6)\n   turn6: U -> (7,2) -> safe.\n   turn7: U -> (8,3) -> safe.\n   turn8: U -> (9,4) -> safe.\n   turn9: U -> (10,5) -> safe.\n   turn10: U -> (11,6) -> safe.\n   turn11: U -> (12,7) -> safe.\n   turn12: U -> (13,8) -> safe (freeway8 not blocked at turn13? \n        freeway8 blocked at 6,7,8,16,17,18 -> turn13 not blocked -> safe.\n   turn13: U -> (14,9) -> goal.\n\nThat takes 10 moves? \n\nBut earlier we had a path that took 9 moves? Actually, the first path that avoided the freeway3 at turn6 by waiting at 2 for one turn (turn5->S) and then moving up:\n\n   turn4: U -> (5,2)\n   turn5: S -> (6,2)   [waiting at 2 for turn5->turn6: safe]\n   turn6: U -> (7,3)   [safe, because freeway3 only blocked at turn6? and at turn7 it's safe]\n   turn7: U -> (8,4)\n   turn8: U -> (9,5)\n   turn9: U -> (10,6)\n   turn10: U -> (11,7)\n   turn11: U -> (12,8)\n   turn12: U -> (13,9)\n\nThat's 9 actions (from turn4 to turn12) and we reach at turn13? Actually, the last action at turn12 moves from 8 to 9 at turn13.\n\nBut the goal is to be at (0,9) at the last turn of the sequence. The sequence of actions is for turns: 4,5,...,12 (9 actions) and the last action (at turn12) leads to y=9 at turn13. So the minimal H is 9.\n\nBut can we do it in 8 actions? That would require starting at turn4 and after 8 actions we are at turn12 and at y=9. \n\nWe need to go from 1 to 9 in 8 moves: that's 8 U moves. \n\nThe moves:\n\n   turn4: U -> (5,2) -> safe.\n   turn5: U -> (6,3) -> unsafe! (freeway3 at turn6 blocked) -> fails.\n\nSo we cannot do 8 moves without waiting.\n\nTherefore, 9 moves is minimal.\n\nBut we have multiple paths. We must output one.\n\nWe also have to avoid freeway8 at turns 6,7,8? but we are not at freeway8 until turn12 (in the above path) and turn12 is not blocked.\n\nBut note: in the above path, at turn12 we are at y=8? and then we move to y=9 at turn13. But at turn12, we are at freeway8? and turn12 is blocked? \n\nWait: freeway8 is blocked at turns 6,7,8,16,17,18. Turn12 is not in that set -> safe.\n\nBut what about the path that we considered earlier without waiting? We saw it failed at turn6. So the path with the wait at y=2 is valid.\n\nBut let me check the entire path:\n\n   turn4: start at (4,1) -> safe (freeway1 at turn4: safe)\n        action: U -> to (5,2)\n\n   turn5: at (5,2) -> safe (freeway2 always safe)\n        action: S -> to (6,2)   [waiting]\n\n   turn6: at (6,2) -> safe (freeway2 safe at turn6)\n        action: U -> to (7,3)\n\n   turn7: at (7,3) -> safe (freeway3 only blocked at turn6 -> safe at turn7)\n        action: U -> to (8,4)\n\n   turn8: at (8,4) -> safe (freeway4 only blocked at turn6 -> safe at turn8)\n        action: U -> to (9,5)\n\n   turn9: at (9,5) -> safe (freeway5 only blocked at turn6 -> safe at turn9)\n        action: U -> to (10,6)\n\n   turn10: at (10,6) -> safe (freeway6 only blocked at turn6 -> safe at turn10)\n        action: U -> to (11,7)\n\n   turn11: at (11,7) -> safe (freeway7 only blocked at turn6 -> safe at turn11)\n        action: U -> to (12,8)\n\n   turn12: at (12,8) -> safe (freeway8 blocked at 6,7,8,16,17,18 -> turn12 not blocked -> safe)\n        action: U -> to (13,9) -> goal.\n\nSo we have 9 actions: U, S, U, U, U, U, U, U, U.\n\nBut the problem asks for the sequence of actions starting at turn t1 (which is 4) for H turns. Here H=9.\n\nSo the actions for turn4, turn5, ..., turn12.\n\nWe can write:\n\nTurn 4: U\nTurn 5: S\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\n\nBut wait, at turn9 we are at y=5, and we do U -> y=6 at turn10. Then at turn10 we are at y=6 -> freeway6: safe? because freeway6 only blocked at turn6 -> safe.\n\nSimilarly, all are safe.\n\nBut note: we have to check freeway8 at turn12: we are at y=8 at turn12 -> freeway8: blocked? \n        freeway8: blocked at turns 6,7,8,16,17,18 -> turn12 is 12, which is not in the set -> safe.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is valid.\n\nIs there a shorter path? We argued that 8 moves is impossible. So this is minimal.\n\nBut note: we might use down moves to avoid? but that would take more moves. So this is minimal.\n\nTherefore, the answer:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 4: U\nTurn 5: S\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\n}\n\nBut wait: we have 9 actions? The problem says: a sequence of actions from t=0 to H-1. So we have t from 4 to 12, which is 9 turns. So H=9.\n\nBut note: the goal is reached at turn13? but the last action is at turn12 and then at turn13 we are at 9. The problem says: we must reach (0,9) at the last turn of the sequence? Actually, the sequence of actions is applied from turn4 to turn12 (9 actions) and then the state at turn13 is the result. The problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\" ? \n\nWait, the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning that the actions are taken at turns: t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\nAnd then the player update: \n   y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + a_{t1}\n   ...\n   y_{t1+H} = y_{t1+H-1} + a_{t1+H-1}\n\nBut note: we start at turn t1 (4) and we do H actions, then the last state we have is at turn t1+H.\n\nThe goal is to have y_{t1+H} = 9? \n\nIn our sequence:\n   H=9 actions: at turns 4,5,...,12 (which are t1+0 to t1+8? because t1=4, so t1+0=4, t1+1=5, ... t1+8=12) -> then the final state is at turn t1+H = 4+9 = 13? and y_{13} = 9.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the minimal H is 9.\n\nBut note: we might have a path that uses 9 moves but without the initial wait? \n\nFor example, if we start by staying at turn4:\n\n   turn4: S -> (5,1) [safe]\n   turn5: U -> (6,2) [safe] \n   turn6: U -> (7,3) [safe] \n   then same as above: \n        turn7: U->4\n        turn8: U->5\n        turn9: U->6\n        turn10: U->7\n        turn11: U->8\n        turn12: U->9 -> then we are at (13,9) -> same H=9.\n\nBut then the sequence: S, U, U, U, U, U, U, U, U -> same length.\n\nBut we want minimal H, and both have H=9.\n\nBut the problem doesn't require the minimal H to be unique. We can output any minimal sequence.\n\nWe already have one: starting with U then S then U...\n\nBut we can also output the one starting with S then U then U...\n\nBut note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and both have H=9.\n\nWe can choose either.\n\nBut we found one. We'll output the first one we found.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to see if we can avoid the wait at the beginning? \n\nBut both take 9 moves.\n\nBut note: in the path starting with S, we do:\n\n   turn4: S -> (5,1) -> safe.\n   turn5: U -> (6,2) -> safe (freeway2 safe at turn6)\n   turn6: U -> (7,3) -> safe (freeway3 safe at turn7? but at turn6 we are not at freeway3? we are moving from 2 to 3 at turn6? \n\n        At turn6: we are at y=2? No: \n            turn5: y=2? \n            turn5: we did U at turn5: from y=1 (at turn5) to y=2 at turn6? \n\n        Actually, at turn5 we are at y=1 (from turn4: S -> stayed at 1). Then at turn5: U -> then at turn6: y=2? \n\n        That doesn't get us to 3 at turn7? \n\n        Correction:\n\n            turn4: start at (4,1) -> S: then at turn5: y=1.\n            turn5: U: then at turn6: y= min(9,1+1)=2.\n\n            So we are at 2 at turn6. Then at turn6: U -> turn7: y=3.\n\n        So yes, at turn7: y=3 -> freeway3: safe at turn7? yes.\n\n        Then we continue:\n\n            turn7: U->4\n            turn8: U->5\n            turn9: U->6\n            turn10: U->7\n            turn11: U->8\n            turn12: U->9\n\n        So we reach at turn13? same as before.\n\n        The sequence: \n            Turn4: S\n            Turn5: U\n            Turn6: U\n            Turn7: U\n            Turn8: U\n            Turn9: U\n            Turn10: U\n            Turn11: U\n            Turn12: U\n\n        Also 9 moves.\n\nBut in this sequence, we don't have to wait at y=2? Actually, we moved from y=1 at turn5 to y=2 at turn6 -> that's normal movement. We didn't do a 'S' in the middle. So this sequence has no explicit wait, but we started by waiting at the start.\n\nBut the total moves: we did one S and then 8 U's -> 9 moves.\n\nSo either sequence is valid.\n\nWe can choose the one without the explicit wait (the second one) because it has more U's and might be simpler? \n\nBut both are minimal.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to go faster by using two moves in the beginning? \n\n   turn4: U -> (5,2)\n   turn5: U -> (6,3) -> unsafe? \n\n   So we cannot.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 9.\n\nWe'll output the sequence that starts with S then 8 U's? \n\nBut let me check the state at turn6 in the second sequence: \n   At turn6: we are at y=2 -> freeway2: safe? yes.\n\nBut wait, in the second sequence we never go to freeway3 at a blocked turn? because we are at freeway3 at turn7 (which is safe) and then move on.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\n   Turn4: S\n   Turn5: U\n   Turn6: U   [to y=3? no: at turn6: from y=1 at turn5? no, we did U at turn5: from y=1 (at turn5) to y=2 at turn6. Then at turn6 we do U: from y=2 to y=3 at turn7. So at turn6 we are at y=2.\n\n   Then at turn7: y=3.\n\n   So the freeway at turn7 is 3 -> which is safe.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is:\n\n   Turn4: S\n   Turn5: U\n   Turn6: U\n   Turn7: U\n   Turn8: U\n   Turn9: U\n   Turn10: U\n   Turn11: U\n   Turn12: U\n\nBut wait, we need to get from 1 to 9: \n   Start: 1\n   After turn4 (S): 1\n   turn5 (U): 2\n   turn6 (U): 3\n   turn7 (U): 4\n   turn8 (U): 5\n   turn9 (U): 6\n   turn10 (U): 7\n   turn11 (U): 8\n   turn12 (U): 9\n\nYes, that's 9 moves: one S and 8 U's? Actually, 9 actions: 1 S and 8 U's? \n\nBut the actions: \n   turn4: S -> 1 move\n   turn5: U -> 2\n   turn6: U -> 3\n   turn7: U -> 4\n   turn8: U -> 5\n   turn9: U -> 6\n   turn10: U -> 7\n   turn11: U -> 8\n   turn12: U -> 9\n\nYes, and then at turn13 we are at 9? But the last action is at turn12, and then the state at turn13 is 9.\n\nBut the problem: the sequence of actions is for turns t1 to t1+H-1 (which is 4 to 12) and then the state at turn t1+H = 4+9 = 13 is the result.\n\nSo it's correct.\n\nBut note: we must check that we are safe at every step.\n\nCheck:\n\n   turn4: y=1 -> freeway1: safe (turn4 not blocked)\n   turn5: y=1 -> freeway1: safe (turn5 not blocked) [because we did S at turn4: so at turn5 we are still at y=1? \n        Actually, the sequence: \n            At turn4: we start at (4,1). We do S -> then at turn5: y5 = y4 + 0 = 1.\n        Then at turn5: we are at (5,1) -> freeway1: safe (only blocked at 16,17,18) -> safe.\n\n   turn5: we do U -> then at turn6: y6 = 1+1 = 2.\n\n   turn6: we are at (6,2) -> freeway2: safe (always) -> safe.\n\n   turn6: we do U -> then at turn7: y7=3.\n\n   turn7: (7,3) -> freeway3: safe (only blocked at 6) -> safe.\n\n   turn7: U -> turn8: y=4 -> freeway4: safe (only blocked at 6) -> safe.\n\n   turn8: U -> turn9: y=5 -> freeway5: safe -> safe.\n\n   turn9: U -> turn10: y=6 -> freeway6: safe -> safe.\n\n   turn10: U -> turn11: y=7 -> freeway7: safe -> safe.\n\n   turn11: U -> turn12: y=8 -> freeway8: at turn12: blocked? \n        freeway8 blocked at 6,7,8,16,17,18 -> turn12 is 12, not in the set -> safe.\n\n   turn12: U -> turn13: y=9 -> goal.\n\nSo the sequence is safe.\n\nAnd it has 9 moves.\n\nTherefore, we can output:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 4: S\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\n}\n\nBut note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\" and we have H=9.\n\nBut we could also output the first sequence we found (with a wait at y=2). It doesn't matter.\n\nWe'll output the above sequence because it is also minimal and we just verified.\n\nBut wait, the initial state: at turn4 we are at y=1. The problem says we are at (0,1). Then we do S at turn4: so we stay at y=1. Then we do 8 U's to go to 9.\n\nBut we could do 8 U's without the initial S? That would be:\n\n   turn4: U -> to y=2 at turn5\n   turn5: U -> to y=3 at turn6 -> unsafe? because at turn6, y=3 -> freeway3 blocked.\n\nSo we cannot.\n\nTherefore, the sequence we have is minimal.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 4: S\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\n}\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach the position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 1)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 4\\) is 9. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by ensuring the player is not on a freeway when it is blocked at \\(x = 0\\).\n\nThe blocking times for each freeway are:\n- Freeway 1: blocked at turns 16, 17, 18\n- Freeway 2: never blocked\n- Freeway 3: blocked at turn 6\n- Freeway 4: blocked at turn 6\n- Freeway 5: blocked at turn 6\n- Freeway 6: blocked at turn 6\n- Freeway 7: blocked at turn 6\n- Freeway 8: blocked at turns 6, 7, 8, 16, 17, 18\n\nThe sequence of actions is:\n- At turn 4, staying (S) keeps the player at \\(y = 1\\), which is safe (freeway 1 is not blocked at turn 4).\n- At turn 5, moving up (U) to \\(y = 2\\) is safe (freeway 2 is never blocked).\n- At turn 6, moving up (U) to \\(y = 3\\) is safe (the player arrives at \\(y = 3\\) at turn 7, and freeway 3 is only blocked at turn 6).\n- From turns 7 to 12, moving up (U) each turn progresses the player to \\(y = 9\\) by turn 13. All intermediate positions are safe:\n  - Turn 7: \\(y = 3\\) (freeway 3 safe at turn 7)\n  - Turn 8: \\(y = 4\\) (freeway 4 safe at turn 8)\n  - Turn 9: \\(y = 5\\) (freeway 5 safe at turn 9)\n  - Turn 10: \\(y = 6\\) (freeway 6 safe at turn 10)\n  - Turn 11: \\(y = 7\\) (freeway 7 safe at turn 11)\n  - Turn 12: \\(y = 8\\) (freeway 8 safe at turn 12, as turn 12 is not blocked)\n- After the action at turn 12, the player reaches \\(y = 9\\) at turn 13.\n\nThis sequence uses 9 actions (turns 4 to 12) and is minimal, as 8 actions are insufficient due to the blockage at freeway 3 on turn 6.\n\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{array}{c}\n\\text{Turn } 4: \\text{S} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 5: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 6: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 7: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 8: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 9: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 10: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 11: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 12: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\end{array}\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 5, and the player is at (0,1). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns H, avoiding collisions.\n\nImportant: Collision occurs at turn T only if at that turn the player is on a freeway y (from 1 to 8) and there is a car on that freeway such that 0 (the x-coordinate of the player) is in the car's span at turn T.\n\nNote: The player updates position at the same time as the cars. However, note that when the player moves from y to y+1 (or y-1) at turn T, then at turn T the player is still on the original row (y) and then at turn T+1 the player is on the new row (y+1). So at the moment of the move (turn T), the player is on the starting row and then moves to the next row at the next turn.\n\nThus, when we are at turn T and we choose an action, the effect on the position is:\n- At the beginning of turn T: player is at (0, y_T)\n- We choose a_T: \n   - If a_T = S, then at the next turn (T+1) the player is still at (0, y_T) [but note: we are now at turn T+1 and the row is still the same? Actually, no: the position update is for the next turn. So:\n      - At turn T: player is at (0, y_T)\n      - After action a_T, the next position is computed for turn T+1: y_{T+1} = y_T + delta, and then we check for collision at turn T+1? \n\nBut note the problem says: \n  \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 in Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nSo at turn T, we are on row y_T and we check the cars on row y_T at turn T.\n\nHowever, when we move at turn T, we are still at row y_T during turn T. Then at turn T+1, we are at row y_{T+1} and then we check the cars on row y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nTherefore, the sequence of events for one turn (turn T) is:\n1. We are at position (0, y_T) at the start of turn T.\n2. We choose action a_T (U, D, S).\n3. The player's new position for turn T+1 is computed: y_{T+1} = y_T + (1 if U, -1 if D, 0 if S).\n4. Then, during turn T, we are still on row y_T and we must check that at turn T, on row y_T, there is no car that has 0 in its span at turn T? \n\nBut note: the problem says \"Collision occurs at turn T only if ...\". So at turn T, we are on row y_T and we check the cars on row y_T at turn T.\n\nHowever, if we move (U or D) at turn T, then at turn T we are still on row y_T, so we check row y_T at turn T. Then at turn T+1, we are on row y_{T+1} and we check row y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nTherefore, when we are at row 1 at turn 5, we must check row 1 at turn 5 for collision? But note the problem says: we are given the state at turn t1 (which is 5). So we are at (0,1) at turn 5. We have to avoid being at a row that has a car covering 0 at that turn.\n\nBut the problem does not say we have to avoid the starting state? It says \"avoid collisions\" during the journey. So we start at turn 5 at (0,1). We must check: at turn 5, is (0,1) safe? That is, is there a car on freeway 1 at turn 5 that has 0 in its span?\n\nSimilarly, for each subsequent turn, we must check the row we are on at that turn.\n\nGiven the car state at turn 5, we can compute the car positions at any future turn T (relative to turn 5: T = 5,6,7,...).\n\nWe are to find a sequence of actions (U, D, S) for turns 5, 6, ... until we reach row 9.\n\nWe start at row 1 at turn 5. We need to reach row 9.\n\nThe minimal H would be at least 8 (if we go up every turn: 1->2->3->...->9 in 8 moves). But we have to avoid the cars.\n\nWe must check for each row (from 1 to 8) at the turn when we are on that row, that the car(s) on that row do not have 0 in their span at that turn.\n\nLet me denote the current turn as t0 = 5.\n\nFor a future turn T (>=5), the position of a car that is left-moving or right-moving at turn 5 is:\n\nFor a car given by (h, τ, d, s) at turn 5:\n\nIf d = 'left', then at turn T (>=5), the span is:\n   [h - s*(T-5), τ - s*(T-5)]\n\nIf d = 'right', then at turn T (>=5), the span is:\n   [τ + s*(T-5), h + s*(T-5)]\n\nBut note: the problem says for left-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, τ]\" and then at T: [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]. However, note that for left-moving, h should be greater than τ? Actually, the representation is given as (head, tail). For left-moving, the head is at a larger x than the tail? But in the example for left-moving: they give (-72,-49,left,24) at turn 5. Then at turn 5, the span is [-72, -49]? Then at turn T, it becomes [-72 -24*(T-5), -49 -24*(T-5)].\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving: (h, τ, right, s) -> at turn T: [τ + s*(T-5), h + s*(T-5)].\n\nBut note: in the right-moving examples, they have (-44,-55,right,4): then at turn 5, the span would be [τ, h] = [-55, -44]? But wait, the problem says for right-moving at t1: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\". So the representation (h, τ) for right-moving is actually (head, tail) but the span is [tail, head]. So for (-44,-55,right,4): tail=-55, head=-44, so span at t1 is [-55, -44]. Then at turn T, it becomes [ -55 + 4*(T-5), -44 + 4*(T-5) ].\n\nSimilarly, for the left-moving car (-72,-49,left,24): at turn 5, span is [head, tail] = [-72, -49]? But note: the problem says for left-moving: \"Span(t1)= [h, τ]\" -> so h=-72, τ=-49, so the car covers from -72 to -49? But that would be from left to right? Actually, no: if the car is moving left, then the head is the front, which is at a more negative x? Actually, the problem doesn't specify the coordinate system, but we know that the player is at x=0. \n\nWe are only concerned when the span includes 0.\n\nSo we need to check for each freeway and each car on that freeway at a given turn T, whether 0 is in the car's span at turn T.\n\nLet's list the cars per freeway at turn 5 (t0=5):\n\nFreeway 1: two cars\n   car1: (-44, -55, right, 4) -> at turn 5: span = [ -55, -44]  (because right: [τ, h] = [-55, -44])\n   car2: (20, 9, right, 4) -> [9, 20] at turn 5.\n\nFreeway 2: one car\n   (-72, -49, left, 24) -> at turn 5: [-72, -49]\n\nFreeway 3: (-12, -47, right, 36) -> [ -47, -12] at turn 5.\n\nFreeway 4: (-12, -23, right, 12) -> [ -23, -12] at turn 5.\n\nFreeway 5: same as 4: (-12, -23, right, 12) -> [ -23, -12] at turn 5.\n\nFreeway 6: same as 4 and 5: (-12, -23, right, 12) -> [ -23, -12] at turn 5.\n\nFreeway 7: (-12, -47, right, 36) -> [ -47, -12] at turn 5.\n\nFreeway 8: three cars\n   car1: (-44, -55, right, 4) -> [ -55, -44] at turn 5.\n   car2: (32, 21, right, 4) -> [21, 32] at turn 5.\n   car3: (-4, -15, right, 4) -> [-15, -4] at turn 5.\n\nNow, we need to check for each freeway and for each turn T (>=5) whether 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway.\n\nBut note: we only care about the freeway at the turn when we are on it.\n\nOur plan: we start at row 1 at turn 5. We must check row 1 at turn 5.\n\nRow 1 (freeway 1) at turn 5:\n   car1: [-55, -44] -> 0 is not in this interval.\n   car2: [9,20] -> 0 is not in [9,20].\n\nSo row 1 is safe at turn 5.\n\nWe then choose an action at turn 5. We want to minimize the number of moves, so we prefer going up (U) if safe.\n\nBut we have to plan the entire path to row 9.\n\nWe can use BFS (state: (turn, row)) and we want to find the minimal turns to row 9.\n\nThe state: (turn, row) and we simulate actions (U, D, S). The turn starts at 5 and increases.\n\nBut note: the turn numbers are absolute. The cars' positions depend on the absolute turn.\n\nWe start at turn 5, row 1.\n\nWe can simulate:\n\nLet me compute the safety of each row for a range of turns (say from turn 5 to turn 20, because minimal turns is 8, but we might have to wait so we go a bit beyond).\n\nFor each freeway k (1 to 8) and for each turn T (>=5), we check if there is any car on freeway k at turn T that has 0 in its span.\n\nWe'll create a 2D array: safe[k][T] = True if at turn T, freeway k is safe (i.e., no car on row k has 0 in its span at T), else False.\n\nBut note: we are only concerned for the rows 1 to 8.\n\nWe'll compute for T from 5 to, say, 20.\n\nLet's do that.\n\nFirst, define the cars per freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: two cars (both right-moving)\n   carA: (h=-44, τ=-55, d='right', s=4) -> at turn T: [ -55 + 4*(T-5), -44 + 4*(T-5) ]\n   carB: (h=20, τ=9, d='right', s=4) -> [ 9 + 4*(T-5), 20 + 4*(T-5) ]\n\nFreeway 2: one car (left-moving)\n   car: (h=-72, τ=-49, d='left', s=24) -> at turn T: [ -72 -24*(T-5), -49 -24*(T-5) ]\n\nFreeway 3: one car (right-moving)\n   car: (h=-12, τ=-47, d='right', s=36) -> [ -47 + 36*(T-5), -12 + 36*(T-5) ]\n\nFreeway 4: one car (right-moving)\n   car: (h=-12, τ=-23, d='right', s=12) -> [ -23 + 12*(T-5), -12 + 12*(T-5) ]\n\nFreeway 5: same as freeway 4: [ -23 + 12*(T-5), -12 + 12*(T-5) ]\n\nFreeway 6: same as freeway 4: [ -23 + 12*(T-5), -12 + 12*(T-5) ]\n\nFreeway 7: same as freeway 3: [ -47 + 36*(T-5), -12 + 36*(T-5) ]\n\nFreeway 8: three cars (all right-moving)\n   carA: (h=-44, τ=-55, s=4) -> [ -55 + 4*(T-5), -44 + 4*(T-5) ]\n   carB: (h=32, τ=21, s=4) -> [21 + 4*(T-5), 32 + 4*(T-5) ]\n   carC: (h=-4, τ=-15, s=4) -> [-15 + 4*(T-5), -4 + 4*(T-5) ]\n\nNow, for each freeway and each T, we check if 0 is in the union of the spans of the cars on that freeway.\n\nBut note: the cars on a freeway might have overlapping spans? But we can check each car individually: if any car has 0 in its span, then unsafe.\n\nLet's compute for freeway 1 (k=1):\n\n   For carA: \n        span = [ -55 + 4*(T-5), -44 + 4*(T-5) ]\n        0 in [A, B] means A <= 0 <= B.\n\n        -55 + 4*(T-5) <= 0 <= -44 + 4*(T-5)\n\n        Solve:\n          -55 + 4*(T-5) <= 0  => 4*(T-5) <= 55 => T-5 <= 55/4 = 13.75 => T <= 18.75 -> T<=18 (since T integer) for the lower bound.\n\n        and 0 <= -44 + 4*(T-5) => 44 <= 4*(T-5) => 11 <= T-5 => T>=16.\n\n        So T must be in [16,18]? Let me check:\n\n          T=16: \n            lower = -55 + 4*(11) = -55+44 = -11\n            upper = -44+44=0 -> so 0 is included? [ -11, 0] -> yes, 0 is included.\n\n          T=17: lower = -55+4*12=-55+48=-7, upper=-44+48=4 -> [ -7,4] includes 0.\n          T=18: lower=-55+52=-3, upper=-44+52=8 -> [ -3,8] includes 0.\n          T=19: lower=-55+56=1, upper=-44+56=12 -> 0 not in [1,12].\n\n        So carA on freeway1 is unsafe at T=16,17,18.\n\n   For carB:\n        [9 + 4*(T-5), 20 + 4*(T-5)]\n        This interval is always above 0 for T>=5? \n          At T=5: [9,20] -> 0 not included.\n          As T increases, the interval moves right. So never includes 0.\n\n   Therefore, freeway1 is unsafe at T=16,17,18.\n\nFreeway 2 (k=2):\n   Only one car: [ -72 -24*(T-5), -49 -24*(T-5) ]\n\n        We need: -72 -24*(T-5) <= 0 <= -49 -24*(T-5)\n\n        But note: the interval is [a, b] with a = -72 -24*(T-5) and b = -49 -24*(T-5). Since the car is moving left, the entire interval is moving left (becoming more negative). So 0 will never be in this interval because both endpoints are negative for T>=5.\n\n        Check: at T=5: [-72, -49] -> negative, so 0 not included.\n        As T increases, the numbers become more negative. So always safe.\n\nFreeway 3 (k=3):\n   [ -47 + 36*(T-5), -12 + 36*(T-5) ]\n\n        We need: -47+36*(T-5) <= 0 <= -12+36*(T-5)\n\n        Solve left: -47+36*(T-5) <=0 -> 36*(T-5) <=47 -> T-5 <= 47/36 ~ 1.305 -> T<=6.305 -> T<=6.\n\n        Solve right: 0 <= -12+36*(T-5) -> 12<=36*(T-5) -> T-5>=12/36=1/3 -> T>=5.33 -> T>=6.\n\n        So T must be in [6,6] (only T=6).\n\n        Check T=6: \n            lower = -47+36*(1) = -11\n            upper = -12+36=24 -> [-11,24] includes 0.\n\n        So freeway3 is unsafe at T=6.\n\n        Also, note that for T<6: \n            T=5: [-47, -12] -> doesn't include 0? (all negative) -> safe.\n            T=6: unsafe.\n            T=7: lower=-47+72=25, upper=-12+72=60 -> [25,60] -> safe.\n\n        So freeway3: unsafe only at T=6.\n\nFreeway 4 (k=4):\n   [ -23 + 12*(T-5), -12 + 12*(T-5) ]\n\n        Conditions:\n          -23+12*(T-5) <= 0 <= -12+12*(T-5)\n\n        Left: -23+12*(T-5)<=0 -> 12*(T-5)<=23 -> T-5<=23/12 ~ 1.916 -> T<=6.916 -> T<=6.\n        Right: 0<= -12+12*(T-5) -> 12<=12*(T-5) -> T-5>=1 -> T>=6.\n\n        So only T=6.\n\n        Check T=6: \n            lower = -23+12= -11\n            upper = -12+12=0 -> [-11,0] -> includes 0.\n\n        So unsafe at T=6.\n\n        T=5: [-23, -12] -> safe.\n        T=7: [-23+24=1, -12+24=12] -> safe.\n\nFreeway 5: same as freeway4 -> unsafe at T=6.\n\nFreeway 6: same as freeway4 -> unsafe at T=6.\n\nFreeway 7: same as freeway3 -> unsafe at T=6.\n\nFreeway 8 (k=8):\n   Three cars:\n\n   carA: [ -55 + 4*(T-5), -44 + 4*(T-5) ]\n        We found for freeway1 that this car is unsafe at T=16,17,18. But for freeway8, we need to check the same formula? \n        Actually, the car is the same as in freeway1? But it's a different car? The representation is the same? \n        But note: the car on freeway8 is (-44,-55,right,4) which is the same as the one on freeway1? But they are on different freeways. So we compute independently.\n\n        For carA on freeway8: same as carA on freeway1: unsafe at T=16,17,18.\n\n   carB: [21 + 4*(T-5), 32 + 4*(T-5)] -> always positive? so safe.\n\n   carC: [-15 + 4*(T-5), -4 + 4*(T-5)]\n        Conditions:\n          -15+4*(T-5) <=0 <= -4+4*(T-5)\n\n        Left: -15+4*(T-5)<=0 -> 4*(T-5)<=15 -> T-5<=15/4=3.75 -> T<=8.75 -> T<=8.\n        Right: 0<= -4+4*(T-5) -> 4<=4*(T-5) -> T-5>=1 -> T>=6.\n\n        So T in [6,8].\n\n        Check:\n          T=6: [-15+4= -11, -4+4=0] -> includes 0.\n          T=7: [-15+8=-7, -4+8=4] -> includes 0.\n          T=8: [-15+12=-3, -4+12=8] -> includes 0.\n          T=9: [-15+16=1, -4+16=12] -> safe.\n\n        So carC is unsafe at T=6,7,8.\n\n        Therefore, freeway8 is unsafe if any of the cars is unsafe. So:\n          T=6: carC is unsafe -> entire freeway unsafe at T=6.\n          T=7: carC unsafe -> unsafe.\n          T=8: carC unsafe -> unsafe.\n          T=16,17,18: carA unsafe -> unsafe.\n\n        But note: at T=6,7,8: carC is unsafe, and at T=16,17,18: carA is unsafe.\n\n        So unsafe at T in {6,7,8,16,17,18}.\n\nSummary of unsafe times for each freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: T in {16,17,18}\nFreeway 2: never unsafe\nFreeway 3: T=6\nFreeway 4: T=6\nFreeway 5: T=6\nFreeway 6: T=6\nFreeway 7: T=6\nFreeway 8: T in {6,7,8,16,17,18}\n\nWe are at turn 5 at row 1 (freeway1). We want to go to row 9.\n\nWe can only move one row at a time (or stay). We cannot skip rows.\n\nThe minimal moves: we need to go from row1 to row9: that's 8 moves up (U). But we might have to wait (S) at some rows to avoid unsafe times.\n\nWe are at turn 5 at row1. Then at turn 6, we can be at row1 (if S), row2 (if U), or row0 (if D). But note row0 is safe because we only have freeways 1-8. The player can be at row0 and row9 without worrying about cars (since cars are on freeways 1-8). However, we cannot go below 0 or above 9.\n\nWe start at row1 at turn5.\n\nWe need to assign an action for each turn starting at turn5.\n\nWe simulate:\n\nWe are at (turn, row) and we choose an action (U, D, S) to get to next row at next turn.\n\nWe must avoid being on a freeway row (1-8) at a turn when that freeway is unsafe.\n\nWe can use BFS (or Dijkstra, since we want minimal turns) in the state (turn, row). The cost is the number of turns passed (so we want to minimize the turn at which we reach row9).\n\nBut note: we start at turn5, row1. We want to reach row9.\n\nWe consider:\n\nState: (t, y) \nActions: U -> (t+1, y+1) [if y+1<=9]\n         D -> (t+1, y-1) [if y-1>=0]\n         S -> (t+1, y)\n\nWe must check that at state (t, y) we are safe? \n\nBut note: the problem says collision occurs at turn T if we are on a freeway y (1<=y<=8) and that freeway at turn T is unsafe. \n\nSo if y=0 or y=9, then no collision (since no cars). But we are only required to reach (0,9). Note: when we are at row9, we are done at that turn. We don't need to stay or do anything else.\n\nSo when we are at row9, we stop.\n\nWe must avoid being at a row in [1,8] at a turn when that row is unsafe.\n\nWe have the unsafe table above.\n\nWe can simulate from turn5 onward.\n\nWe'll do a BFS (queue by turn) and we mark states (t,y) that we have visited.\n\nWe start: (5,1) -> safe? Yes, as we checked freeway1 at turn5: safe.\n\nWe want to reach any state (t,9) and then we stop.\n\nWe note that if we go up without waiting, we would be:\n\nTurn5: row1 -> action U -> then at turn6 we are at row2.\nBut row2 at turn6: is freeway2. Is freeway2 safe at turn6? From above, freeway2 is always safe. So safe.\n\nTurn6: at row2 -> action U -> turn7: row3.\nRow3 at turn7: freeway3. We have freeway3 unsafe only at turn6. So turn7: safe.\n\nTurn7: row3 -> U -> turn8: row4.\nRow4 at turn8: freeway4. Freeway4 unsafe only at turn6 -> safe.\n\nTurn8: row4 -> U -> turn9: row5.\nRow5 at turn9: freeway5. Freeway5 unsafe only at turn6 -> safe.\n\nTurn9: row5 -> U -> turn10: row6.\nRow6 at turn10: freeway6. unsafe only at turn6 -> safe.\n\nTurn10: row6 -> U -> turn11: row7.\nRow7 at turn11: freeway7. unsafe only at turn6 -> safe.\n\nTurn11: row7 -> U -> turn12: row8.\nRow8 at turn12: freeway8. We have freeway8 unsafe at T=6,7,8,16,17,18. So at turn12: safe.\n\nTurn12: row8 -> U -> turn13: row9. Done.\n\nSo H = 13-5 = 8 moves? But we did 8 moves: from turn5 to turn13, that's 8 actions: at turns 5,6,...,12. Then at turn13 we are at row9.\n\nBut let me check the turns:\n\n  Start: turn5: at row1.\n  After action at turn5: turn6 -> row2.\n  After action at turn6: turn7 -> row3.\n  After action at turn7: turn8 -> row4.\n  After action at turn8: turn9 -> row5.\n  After action at turn9: turn10 -> row6.\n  After action at turn10: turn11 -> row7.\n  After action at turn11: turn12 -> row8.\n  After action at turn12: turn13 -> row9.\n\nSo we use 8 actions (from turn5 to turn12) and we are at row9 at turn13. But the problem says: we are to output actions for turns t1 to t1+H-1, and we want the minimal H such that at turn t1+H-1 we are at row9? \n\nWait: the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and then at the end of that sequence, we have done H actions and we are at turn t1+H? And we require that at turn t1+H-1 we are at (0,9)? \n\nLet me read: \n  \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nBut note: the player update: \n   y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t.\n\nSo after the first action (at t1 =5), we get y6 = y5 + Delta y5.\n\nAfter H actions (at t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1), we have updated H times, so the last update is at turn t1+H-1, and then we are at row y_{t1+H} = 9.\n\nBut the problem says: \"reach (0,9)\" at turn t1+H-1? \n\nWait: the problem says: \"such that y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nBut note the indexing: \n   We start at turn t1 (which is 5) at position (0, y5) = (0,1).\n   Then we do action a5 -> then at turn6, we have y6 = y5 + Delta y5.\n\n   So after k actions (at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+k-1), we have y_{t1+k} = ... .\n\n   We want y_{t1+H} = 9? \n\nBut the problem says: \"y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nThis is a bit confusing.\n\nRead: \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning t from 0 to H-1, so actions at t1+0, t1+1, ... , t1+H-1.\n\nThen, the position after the last action: \n   We start at turn t1: position (0, y_{t1})\n   After action a_{t1}: then at turn t1+1, we are at y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + Delta a_{t1}.\n   ...\n   After the last action (at turn t1+H-1), then at the next turn (turn t1+H) we are at y_{t1+H}.\n\nBut the problem says: we want to reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1? \n\nNo, the problem says: \"such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\".\n\nBut note: at the beginning of turn t, we are at y_t. Then we choose an action a_t, and then we move to y_{t+1} at the next turn.\n\nSo to be at row9 at the beginning of turn T, we must have y_T = 9.\n\nThe problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\" -> meaning at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at row9.\n\nBut that would require that we have already arrived at row9 by the actions taken before turn t1+H-1.\n\nHow do we achieve that?\n\nWe start at turn t1 (5): we are at row1. Then we do H-1 actions? \n\nBut the sequence of actions is from t1 to t1+H-1 (total H actions). Then the state after these actions would be at turn t1+H.\n\nBut the problem requires that at turn t1+H-1 we are at row9.\n\nThis implies that the last action that got us to row9 was taken at turn t1+H-2? \n\nWait, let me map:\n\n   Turn:  5: y5 = 1 (given)\n   Action a5: then at turn6, y6 = y5 + Delta a5.\n\n   We want at turn t1+H-1 (i.e., turn 5+H-1) to have y_{5+H-1} = 9.\n\n   How did we get to row9 at turn 5+H-1? \n        It must be that at turn 5+H-2, we were at row8 and then did U, or at row9 and then did S, or at row10 (but not allowed) and then did D? But we cannot go above 9.\n\n   Actually, we can get to row9 by:\n        Being at row8 at turn 5+H-2 and then doing U -> then at turn 5+H-1: row9.\n        Or being at row9 at turn 5+H-2 and then doing S -> then at turn 5+H-1: row9.\n        Or being at row10 at turn 5+H-2? But we cannot be at row10.\n\n   So the last action (if we are to be at row9 at turn 5+H-1) must be taken at turn 5+H-2? But the problem says the sequence of actions goes up to a_{t1+H-1} = a_{5+H-1}. \n\n   This is confusing.\n\nLet me read the problem again: \n   \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" \n   and then \"such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\".\n\nBut note: the action a_{t1+t} is taken at turn t1+t. \n\n   For t=0: action at t1 (5)\n   For t=1: action at t1+1 (6)\n   ...\n   For t=H-1: action at t1+H-1.\n\nThen the position after the last action: we have taken H actions, so we are at turn t1+H.\n\nBut the problem requires that at turn t1+H-1 we are at row9.\n\nThis implies that we must be at row9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, without having taken the action at turn t1+H-1? \n\nBut then why do we take an action at turn t1+H-1?\n\nAlternatively, the requirement might be that we are at row9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, and then we take an action at turn t1+H-1? But that action might move us away? \n\nThis seems inconsistent.\n\nLooking back: \n   \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nand then \"such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\"\n\nI think the intention is: after taking the sequence of H actions (from turn t1 to turn t1+H-1), the player should be at row9 at the next turn (turn t1+H). But then it should be y_{t1+H}=9.\n\nBut the problem says y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nAlternatively, note that the initial turn is t1, and we are at y_{t1}. Then we take actions for H turns (so the last action is at turn t1+H-1) and then at that same turn (t1+H-1) we are at row9? But that would mean that we were at row9 at the start of turn t1+H-1, and then we take an action (which might change it).\n\nI think there is a misunderstanding.\n\nLooking at the update: the position at turn t is determined at the start of the turn. Then we choose an action, and that action determines the position at turn t+1.\n\nTherefore, to be at row9 at the start of turn T, we must have had the action at turn T-1 be such that it moved to row9 (if we were at row8 and did U, or row9 and did S, or row10 and did D, but row10 is invalid).\n\nBut the problem says: we are to output the actions taken at turns t1, t1+1, ... , t1+H-1, and we want that at the start of turn t1+H-1, the player is at row9? \n\nBut then the last action we output is at turn t1+H-1, which would then update the position to turn t1+H. But we don't care about turn t1+H? \n\nThe problem says: \"reach (0,9)\" at turn t1+H-1.\n\nSo we must be at row9 at the start of turn t1+H-1.\n\nThat means the action taken at turn t1+H-2 is the one that got us to row9 at turn t1+H-1.\n\nBut then we take an extra action at turn t1+H-1? Why? \n\nThe problem says: the sequence of actions is from t=0 to H-1, meaning H actions. But if we are already at row9 at the start of turn t1+H-1, then we don't need to take an action at that turn? \n\nAlternatively, the problem might mean that we take H actions and then at the moment after the last action, we are at row9? But the last action is taken at turn t1+H-1, and then the position at turn t1+H is set. \n\nI think the problem statement has a typo. It should be: we want y_{t1+H} = 9.\n\nBut let me check the example: minimal moves. The minimal moves to go from row1 to row9 is 8 moves (if we go up 8 times). Then we would be at row9 at turn 5+8 = 13. So H should be 8, and then we would have taken actions at turns 5 to 12 (8 actions), and then at turn13 we are at row9.\n\nBut the problem says: we want y_{t1+H-1}=9 -> so at turn 5+8-1=12, we want to be at row9. \n\nSo then we must be at row9 at the start of turn12.\n\nThat means we must have arrived at row9 by turn12.\n\nHow? We start at turn5 at row1. We have 7 moves from turn5 to turn11. So we must go from row1 to row9 in 7 moves? But that's 8 steps? \n\nWe start at row1 at turn5. \nAfter 1 move (at turn5): at turn6 we are at row2.\nAfter 2 moves: turn7 -> row3.\n...\nAfter 7 moves: turn12 -> row8? Then to get to row9 at turn12, we would have to be at row9 at the start of turn12, which would require that we were at row9 at turn11 and then did S, or at row8 at turn11 and then did U at turn11 to be at row9 at turn12.\n\nSo if we do 7 up moves and then one more up move at turn11, we get to row9 at turn12. But then we have done 8 moves? \n\nBut the sequence of actions: \n   We take actions at turns: 5,6,7,8,9,10,11 -> 7 actions? Then we are at row8 at turn12? But we want to be at row9 at turn12.\n\nAlternatively, we take 8 actions: \n   at turns5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12.\n\nBut then at turn12 (after the last action) we are at row9 at turn13? \n\nI think there is an off-by-one.\n\nGiven the confusion, let me look at the problem statement: \n   \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\"\n\nSo we must have the player at row9 at the start of turn t1+H-1.\n\nThis means that the actions taken from turn t1 to turn t1+H-2 have brought us to row9 by the start of turn t1+H-1.\n\nTherefore, the last action that matters is at turn t1+H-2.\n\nBut the sequence of actions we output includes a_{t1+H-1}? \n\nThe problem says: the sequence is for t=0 to H-1, so that's a_{t1} to a_{t1+H-1}. \n\nSo we output H actions, but the last action (at turn t1+H-1) is taken when we are already at row9? And then we might move away? \n\nBut the requirement is only to reach row9 and then we stop. However, the problem doesn't say we stop immediately; we have to output exactly H actions.\n\nBut note: after we reach row9, we could do S to stay, but that would be one extra action.\n\nTo minimize H, we would not want to do extra actions.\n\nTherefore, we must design the actions such that at the start of turn t1+H-1, we are at row9, and then the action at turn t1+H-1 is not necessary? But the problem requires H actions.\n\nAlternatively, the minimal H might be achieved when we arrive at row9 at turn t1+H-1 by the action taken at turn t1+H-2.\n\nBut then we have to output an action for turn t1+H-1? Even though we are already at row9. We can do S.\n\nSo the total number of actions H would be: the number of moves to get to row9 plus one (the S at the end).\n\nBut that would be non-minimal in terms of turns? \n\nLet me clarify with the example of going up without obstacles:\n\n   We start at turn5 at row1.\n   We want to be at row9 at turn T.\n   We need to go up 8 times.\n\n   If we do U at turn5: then at turn6 we are at row2.\n   ...\n   U at turn12: then at turn13 we are at row9.\n\n   But we want to be at row9 at the start of turn t1+H-1 = 5+H-1.\n\n   We want 5+H-1 = 13? -> H-1 = 8 -> H=9.\n\n   But then we would have to output 9 actions? That doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, if we are at row9 at the start of turn12, then we must have been at row8 at turn11 and done U at turn11 to be at row9 at turn12.\n\n   Then the actions:\n        turn5: U (to row2 at turn6)\n        turn6: U (to row3 at turn7)\n        ...\n        turn11: U (to row9 at turn12)\n\n   So we did 7 U's from turn5 to turn11 (7 actions) and then at turn12 we are at row9.\n\n   Then H-1 = 7? because the last action is at turn11 (t1+6) -> wait: t1=5, so turn11 = t1+6.\n\n   The actions: t=0 to t=H-1: that's turns t1 to t1+H-1.\n\n   We did actions at turns5,6,7,8,9,10,11 -> that's 7 actions. So H=7.\n\n   And then at turn t1+H-1 = 5+7-1 = 11, we are at row9? But no: at the start of turn11, we are at row8. Then we do U at turn11, and then at turn12 we are at row9. But the problem requires that at turn t1+H-1=11, we are at row9.\n\n   We are not at row9 at turn11; we are at row9 at turn12.\n\n   So this does not satisfy.\n\nWe must be at row9 at the start of turn11.\n\n   How? \n        At the start of turn11, we are at row9.\n        That means the action at turn10 must have brought us to row9 at turn11.\n        So at turn10, we were at row8 and did U, or at row9 and did S, or at row10 and did D.\n\n   We can do:\n        turn5: U -> turn6: row2\n        turn6: U -> turn7: row3\n        turn7: U -> turn8: row4\n        turn8: U -> turn9: row5\n        turn9: U -> turn10: row6\n        turn10: U -> turn11: row7 -> not 9.\n\n   We need to be at row9 at turn11.\n\n   Alternatively, we can go faster? But we can only move one per turn.\n\n   Unless we start higher? But we start at row1.\n\n   So it takes at least 8 moves to go from 1 to 9.\n\n   Therefore, we must be at row9 at turn5+8 = turn13.\n\n   So the earliest turn at which we can be at row9 is turn13.\n\n   Therefore, we must have y_{13} =9.\n\n   And we want this to be at turn t1+H-1 = 5+H-1.\n\n   So 5+H-1 = 13 -> H=9.\n\n   But then we would have to output 9 actions.\n\n   And the actions would be: \n        turn5: U\n        turn6: U\n        turn7: U\n        turn8: U\n        turn9: U\n        turn10: U\n        turn11: U\n        turn12: U  -> then at turn13: row9.\n        turn13: ? \n   But the last action is at turn13? and then we are at row9 at turn14? \n\n   This is messy.\n\nGiven the confusion, I think the problem likely meant that we are to be at row9 at the turn after the last action. \n\nBut the problem explicitly says: \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\".\n\nAnother possibility: the turns are counted including the starting turn. But the starting turn is turn5, and we are at row1, not row9.\n\nI think there might be a mistake in the problem statement.\n\nHowever, to resolve, let us assume that we are to output a sequence of H actions (at turns t1 to t1+H-1) such that at the beginning of turn t1+H, we are at row9. \n\nThen the requirement should be y_{t1+H}=9.\n\nAnd the minimal H for the obstacle-free case is 8.\n\nAnd then the answer format would be actions from turn5 to turn12.\n\nAnd then we are at row9 at turn13.\n\nThis matches the example above.\n\nIf the problem really means y_{t1+H-1}=9, then we would need H=9 and then we are at row9 at turn13? but then the turn for y_{t1+H-1}=y_{13} would be turn13, so we must be at row9 at turn13, which would require actions from turn5 to turn12 (8 actions) and then we are at row9 at turn13.\n\nBut then the last action is at turn12, and then we are at row9 at turn13.\n\n So to have y_{13}=9, we need to be at row9 at turn13.\n\n Therefore, in the answer, we would output actions for turns5 to turn12 (H=8 actions), and then at turn13 we are at row9.\n\n The problem says: we want y_{t1+H-1}=9 -> which would be y_{5+8-1}=y_{12}=9.\n\n But we are at row9 at turn13, not turn12.\n\n So this does not satisfy.\n\n Alternatively, if we do actions from turn5 to turn12 (8 actions), then the state after the last action is at turn13: row9.\n\n Therefore, the problem likely meant that we are to be at row9 at turn t1+H.\n\n I think we should assume that the intended meaning is to be at row9 at turn t1+H.\n\n Then the minimal H is the number of actions taken, and we are at row9 at the next turn.\n\n This is standard in such problems.\n\n So I will assume that we require y_{t1+H} = 9.\n\n Therefore, we want to be at row9 at turn 5+H.\n\n We start at row1 at turn5.\n\n We took H actions (at turns5 to 5+H-1) and then at turn5+H, we are at row9.\n\n The minimal H in the obstacle-free case is 8.\n\n Now, with obstacles, we have a path that takes 8 actions (from turn5 to turn12) and then at turn13 we are at row9, as described earlier.\n\n But we must check if that path is safe.\n\n The path: \n   turn5: at row1 -> safe (as we saw)\n   action U: then at turn6, we are at row2.\n\n   turn6: at row2 -> freeway2, which is always safe.\n   action U: then at turn7, row3.\n\n   turn7: at row3 -> freeway3: unsafe only at turn6 -> safe at turn7.\n   action U: turn8, row4.\n\n   turn8: at row4 -> freeway4: unsafe only at turn6 -> safe.\n   action U: turn9, row5.\n\n   turn9: at row5 -> freeway5: unsafe only at turn6 -> safe.\n   action U: turn10, row6.\n\n   turn10: at row6 -> freeway6: unsafe only at turn6 -> safe.\n   action U: turn11, row7.\n\n   turn11: at row7 -> freeway7: unsafe only at turn6 -> safe.\n   action U: turn12, row8.\n\n   turn12: at row8 -> freeway8: unsafe at T in {6,7,8,16,17,18} -> turn12 is safe.\n   action U: turn13, row9.\n\n So the entire path is safe.\n\n Therefore, we can do it in H=8 actions.\n\n The actions are:\n   turn5: U\n   turn6: U\n   turn7: U\n   turn8: U\n   turn9: U\n   turn10: U\n   turn11: U\n   turn12: U\n\n But wait, at turn12 we are at row8 and we do U, then at turn13 we are at row9.\n\n And we stop.\n\n However, the problem says to output the actions for turns t1 to t1+H-1, which is turn5 to turn12.\n\n So we output:\n\n   Turn 5: U\n   Turn 6: U\n   Turn 7: U\n   Turn 8: U\n   Turn 9: U\n   Turn 10: U\n   Turn 11: U\n   Turn 12: U\n\n But note: the problem might be using the requirement y_{t1+H-1}=9, but we have y_{13}=9, not y_{12}=9.\n\n If the problem insists on y_{t1+H-1}=9, then we would have to be at row9 at turn12.\n\n To be at row9 at turn12, we must have been at row9 at turn11 and done S, or at row8 at turn11 and done U.\n\n How to be at row9 at turn12:\n\n   We need to arrive at row9 by turn12.\n\n   That means we must have done the last up move at turn11.\n\n   So we need to be at row8 at turn11 and then do U at turn11 to be at row9 at turn12.\n\n   So the actions would be:\n        turn5: U -> row2 at turn6\n        turn6: U -> row3 at turn7\n        turn7: U -> row4 at turn8\n        turn8: U -> row5 at turn9\n        turn9: U -> row6 at turn10\n        turn10: U -> row7 at turn11\n        turn11: U -> row8 at turn12? -> no, at turn12 we would be at row8 only if we did S at turn11? \n\n   Let me clarify:\n\n        At turn11: we are at row7 (from the previous action at turn10).\n        Then we do U at turn11: then at turn12, we are at row8.\n\n   To be at row9 at turn12, we must have been at row8 or row9 or row10 at turn11.\n\n   So we need to be at row8 at turn11.\n\n   How to be at row8 at turn11? \n        turn5: start at row1\n        turn5: U -> row2 at turn6\n        turn6: U -> row3 at turn7\n        turn7: U -> row4 at turn8\n        turn8: U -> row5 at turn9\n        turn9: U -> row6 at turn10\n        turn10: U -> row7 at turn11\n        turn11: then to be at row8 at turn12, we do U at turn11 -> then at turn12 we are at row8.\n\n   We are not at row9.\n\n   Alternatively, if we are at row8 at turn11, then we could do S at turn11 to be at row8 at turn12? not row9.\n\n   Or if we are at row9 at turn11, then we can do S to be at row9 at turn12.\n\n   But to be at row9 at turn11, we would need to have arrived there by turn11.\n\n   That would require 8 moves from row1 to row9 in 6 actions? because we have actions from turn5 to turn10 (6 actions) to go from row1 to row9.\n\n   Impossible.\n\n   Therefore, we cannot be at row9 at turn12 with only 7 actions? because from row1 to row9 takes 8 moves.\n\n   With 7 actions, the best we can be is row8 at turn12.\n\n   So to be at row9 at turn12, we would need 8 actions, but then the last action (at turn12) would be either S (if we are already at row9) or U (from row8) or D (from row10).\n\n   But then at turn12, we are at row9 at turn13.\n\n   So we cannot be at row9 at turn12 if we start at row1 at turn5 and move only one per turn.\n\n   Therefore, I think the problem likely meant that we are to be at row9 at turn t1+H.\n\n   Given the above, I will output the actions for the path that gets us to row9 at turn13 (H=8 actions).\n\n   If the problem intended otherwise, then we might have to adjust.\n\n   But the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and in the obstacle-free case, the minimal H is 8.\n\n   So I will go with that.\n\n   Therefore, the answer is 8 actions of U.\n\n   But wait, is there a faster way? No, because we have to move up 8 times.\n\n   And we have shown that path is safe.\n\n   However, let me double-check freeway8 at turn12: \n        freeway8 has cars:\n          carA: at turn12: T=12 -> [ -55 + 4*(12-5) = -55+28 = -27, -44+28=-16] -> [-27,-16] -> safe.\n          carB: [21+4*7=21+28=49, 32+28=60] -> safe.\n          carC: [-15+28=13, -4+28=24] -> safe.\n\n        And freeway8 is unsafe at T=6,7,8,16,17,18. T=12 is safe.\n\n   So it is safe.\n\n   Therefore, the answer is:\n\n        Turn 5: U\n        Turn 6: U\n        Turn 7: U\n        Turn 8: U\n        Turn 9: U\n        Turn 10: U\n        Turn 11: U\n        Turn 12: U\n\n   But note: the problem says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" so we start with turn5.\n\n   Format:\n\n        \\boxed{\n        Turn 5: U\n        Turn 6: U\n        Turn 7: U\n        Turn 8: U\n        Turn 9: U\n        Turn 10: U\n        Turn 11: U\n        Turn 12: U\n        }\n\n   But wait, we are at row1 at turn5. Then after U at turn5, we are at row2 at turn6. Then U at turn6 to row3 at turn7, etc.\n\n   And we reach row9 at turn13.\n\n   This is minimal.\n\n   However, the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and we have H=8.\n\n   But is there a path with H=7? That would require only 7 actions, and then at turn5+7=12, we would be at row9.\n\n   But as reasoned, we cannot go from row1 to row9 in 7 moves (because 8 steps).\n\n   So H=8 is minimal.\n\n   But note: we might avoid some rows by waiting? But waiting would only increase H.\n\n   So we output the above.\n\n   However, what if we encounter an obstacle in the future? In this path, we avoid all obstacles.\n\n   But note: the path we described earlier goes through row2 at turn6, row3 at turn7, etc., and we checked that at the turns we are on those freeways, they are safe.\n\n   Therefore, this is safe.\n\n   So the answer is 8 consecutive U's.\n\n   Let me write it in the box.\n\n   But the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and H=8, so t from 0 to 7, which corresponds to turns 5 to 12.\n\n   So:\n\n        Turn 5: U\n        Turn 6: U\n        Turn 7: U\n        Turn 8: U\n        Turn 9: U\n        Turn 10: U\n        Turn 11: U\n        Turn 12: U\n\n   But note: the turn numbers in the output should be: \n        Turn 5: U\n        Turn 6: U\n        ...\n\n   We are done.\n\n   However, to be thorough, what if at some point we have to wait? \n\n   For example, if we were to go through row8 at turn8, then freeway8 is unsafe at turn8 (from our table, freeway8 unsafe at T=8). \n\n   But in our path, we are on row8 at turn12, not turn8.\n\n   So we avoided that.\n\n   Similarly, row3 at turn7 is safe, while at turn6 it would be unsafe.\n\n   So we are safe.\n\n   Therefore, the minimal H is 8.\n\n   Final answer.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 1) at turn 5. The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y = 1 to 8.\n\nThe unsafe turns for each freeway, based on car positions and movements, are:\n- Freeway 1: unsafe at turns 16, 17, 18\n- Freeway 2: always safe\n- Freeway 3: unsafe at turn 6\n- Freeway 4: unsafe at turn 6\n- Freeway 5: unsafe at turn 6\n- Freeway 6: unsafe at turn 6\n- Freeway 7: unsafe at turn 6\n- Freeway 8: unsafe at turns 6, 7, 8, 16, 17, 18\n\nThe minimal path to reach row 9 requires 8 upward moves (U) since the player must move from row 1 to row 9, a difference of 8 rows. The sequence of actions is:\n\n- At turn 5, move up to row 2 at turn 6. Freeway 1 at turn 5 is safe.\n- At turn 6, move up to row 3 at turn 7. Freeway 2 at turn 6 is safe.\n- At turn 7, move up to row 4 at turn 8. Freeway 3 at turn 7 is safe (unsafe only at turn 6).\n- At turn 8, move up to row 5 at turn 9. Freeway 4 at turn 8 is safe (unsafe only at turn 6).\n- At turn 9, move up to row 6 at turn 10. Freeway 5 at turn 9 is safe (unsafe only at turn 6).\n- At turn 10, move up to row 7 at turn 11. Freeway 6 at turn 10 is safe (unsafe only at turn 6).\n- At turn 11, move up to row 8 at turn 12. Freeway 7 at turn 11 is safe (unsafe only at turn 6).\n- At turn 12, move up to row 9 at turn 13. Freeway 8 at turn 12 is safe (unsafe at turns 6, 7, 8, 16, 17, 18; turn 12 is safe).\n\nThis sequence of 8 consecutive U actions ensures the player reaches row 9 at turn 13 without any collisions, as all freeways encountered during the path are safe at the respective turns. The minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 8.\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn } 5: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 6: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 7: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 8: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 9: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 10: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 11: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 12: \\text{U}\n}",

The current turn is t1 = 6, and I start at y=2.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how the cars move. Each car has a head and tail, and they move left or right at a constant speed. Collision happens only if at turn T, I'm on a freeway y_T and for that freeway, there's a car where 0 is in its span at that turn. Also, when I move to a new y, I'm not on that new y until the next turn, so I only check for collision on the freeway I'm currently on at the beginning of the turn.\n\nThe player position updates at the end of the turn based on the action. Let me read carefully.\n\n\"Player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\"\n\nAnd Δy_t depends on action a_t. So at turn t, I choose action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}. Then at turn t+1, I'm at position (0, y_{t+1}).\n\nCollision: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\ny_T is the player's y-position at turn T. So when I am at position (0, y_T) at turn T, I check if for that freeway y_T, there is a car such that 0 is in its span at time T.\n\nAlso, note: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nThat makes sense. When I'm moving, during turn T, I'm still on y_T, so I only care about cars on y_T at time T. After moving, I'm on y_{T+1} for turn T+1.\n\nNow, the goal is to reach y=9 as quickly as possible. Since y=9 is the top, and I start from y=2, I probably want to go up as much as possible, but I have to avoid the cars.\n\ny ranges from 0 to 9, with freeways 1 to 8 having cars. y=0 and y=9 might be safe, but I need to be at (0,9), which might be the goal, no cars there, I assume.\n\nThe freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 should be safe, but I need to end on y=9.\n\nNow, current position at t=6: (0,2)\n\nI need to find actions from t=6 onwards.\n\nLet me denote the current time as t1 = 6.\n\nI need to compute for each future turn T, the positions of the cars on each freeway.\n\nFirst, let's list all the cars and their movements.\n\nFor each car, we have (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s).\n\nDirection: left or right. From the update:\n\nLeft-moving: Span(T) = [h - s(T - t1), τ - s(T - t1)]\n\nIn the text: for left-moving, Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nh and τ are positions at time t1.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving: Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]? Let's see.\n\n\"Right-moving: [Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s (T-t1), h + s (T-t1)]\"\n\nIn the car state, it's given as (head h, tail τ, direction, speed).\n\nFor right-moving, Span(t1) = [τ, h], meaning τ is the left end, h is the right end? Let's see the notation.\n\nIn the table, for freeway 1: (-40, -51, right, 4) and (24, 13, right, 4)\n\nFor the first car, h = -40, τ = -51, d=right.\n\nSince it's right-moving, and Span(t1) = [τ, h]? But τ = -51, h = -40, so -51 to -40, which is from left to right, so τ should be the tail (left) and h the head (right) for right-moving cars.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, on freeway 2: (48, 71, left, 24)\n\nh=48, τ=71, d=left. Since left-moving, Span(t1) = [h, τ] = [48,71], which is from left to right? 48 to 71, so if it's left-moving, moving left, so at time t1, head is at 48, tail at 71? But that would be decreasing, so head is left, tail is right? I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me clarify the span notation.\n\nFrom the update rule:\n\nFor left-moving car: at time t1, Span(t1) = [h, τ], and at time T, Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nSince it's moving left, both ends decrease.\n\nFor example, freeway 2: (48, 71, left, 24)\n\nSo at t1, Span(t1) = [h, τ] = [48, 71], so head at 48, tail at 71. Since moving left, head is the left end? But 48 to 71, if moving left, the car is from 48 to 71, and moving left, so the left end (head) is 48, right end (tail) is 71. But typically, head is front, so for left-moving, front is left.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving, like freeway 1: (-40, -51, right, 4)\n\nd=right, so Span(t1) = [τ, h]? From the text: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h] for right-moving\"\n\nIn text: \"Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ]\"\n\n\"Right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h]\"\n\nFor right-moving, Span(t1) = [τ, h], so τ is left, h is right.\n\nFor car (-40, -51, right, 4), τ = -51, h = -40, so Span(t1) = [-51, -40], which makes sense, from left to right.\n\nAnd for left-moving, like (48,71,left,24), Span(t1) = [48,71], from left to right.\n\nNow, at time T, for left-moving, Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)] = [48 - 24(T-6), 71 - 24(T-6)] for that car.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving, Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] = [-51 + 4(T-6), -40 + 4(T-6)] for the first car on freeway 1.\n\nNow, collision happens if at turn T, I am on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there is a car such that 0 is within [left, right] of its span at time T.\n\nI need to find when 0 is covered for each freeway at each turn.\n\nSince the cars move continuously, but we only care at integer turns, I think.\n\nT is turn number, so integer.\n\nNow, let's list all freeways and their cars.\n\nFreeway 1 (y=1): two cars\n\nCar A: (-40, -51, right, 4) → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] = [-51 + 4(T-6), -40 + 4(T-6)]\n\nSince t1=6, let Δt = T - 6, so for T >=6, Δt >=0.\n\nSpan(T) = [-51 + 4Δt, -40 + 4Δt]\n\nCar B: (24, 13, right, 4) — wait, (h,τ) = (24,13), d=right, so Span(t1) = [τ, h] = [13,24]\n\nSpan(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] = [13 + 4Δt, 24 + 4Δt]\n\nFreeway 2 (y=2): one car (48,71,left,24)\n\nd=left, Span(t1) = [h,τ] = [48,71]\n\nSpan(T) = [h - sΔt, τ - sΔt] = [48 - 24Δt, 71 - 24Δt] with Δt = T-6\n\nFreeway 3 (y=3): (24, -11, right, 36)\n\n(h,τ) = (24,-11), d=right, Span(t1) = [τ,h] = [-11,24]\n\nSpan(T) = [τ + sΔt, h + sΔt] = [-11 + 36Δt, 24 + 36Δt]\n\nFreeway 4 (y=4): (0, -11, right, 12)\n\n(h,τ) = (0,-11), d=right, Span(t1) = [τ,h] = [-11,0]\n\nSpan(T) = [-11 + 12Δt, 0 + 12Δt] = [-11 + 12Δt, 12Δt]\n\nFreeway 5 (y=5): same as freeway 4? (0, -11, right, 12) so identical to freeway 4.\n\nCar state: | 5 | (0, -11, right, 12) |\n\nYes, same as freeway 4.\n\nFreeway 6 (y=6): (0, -11, right, 12) again? | 6 | (0, -11, right, 12) | so same as 4 and 5.\n\nFreeway 7 (y=7): (24, -11, right, 36) same as freeway 3.\n\nFreeway 8 (y=8): three cars\n\nFirst: (-40, -51, right, 4) same as freeway 1 car A.\n\nSecond: (36, 25, right, 4) — (h,τ) = (36,25), d=right, Span(t1) = [τ,h] = [25,36]\n\nSpan(T) = [25 + 4Δt, 36 + 4Δt]\n\nThird: (0, -11, right, 4) — (h,τ) = (0,-11), d=right, Span(t1) = [τ,h] = [-11,0]\n\nSpan(T) = [-11 + 4Δt, 0 + 4Δt] = [-11 + 4Δt, 4Δt]\n\nNow, I need to find for each freeway and each time, whether 0 is covered by any car on that freeway.\n\nThat is, for a given freeway k and time T, is 0 in the span of any car on k at T.\n\nBut since multiple cars, we need to check all.\n\nNow, since the spans are intervals, we can find for each car the times when it covers 0.\n\nBut for collision, we care about the freeway at the time we are on it.\n\nNow, I start at t=6, y=2.\n\nAt turn T, I am at y_T, which is determined by previous actions.\n\nI need to choose a sequence of actions to move from y=2 to y=9.\n\nEach action U, D, S changes y by +1, -1, 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nSince I need to go to y=9, and start from y=2, I need to go up, so probably U actions, but I have to avoid cars when I'm on the freeways.\n\nI can stay or go down to avoid, but that might take more turns, so I want to minimize H, so I should go up as fast as possible, only avoiding when necessary.\n\nH is the number of turns from t1, so from turn t1 to t1+H-1, I take actions, and after H actions, I am at y=9.\n\ny_{t1 + t} for t from 0 to H-1, but y_{t1} is given, actions from a_{t1} to a_{t1+H-1}, and after H actions, y_{t1+H} = 9.\n\nThe sequence is {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, so a_{t1} to a_{t1+H-1}, and after these H actions, position is y_{t1+H} = 9.\n\nAt turn t1, I start at y_{t1} =2, I choose a_{t1}, which sets y_{t1+1}, and so on, up to a_{t1+H-1}, which sets y_{t1+H} =9.\n\nThen H is the number of actions.\n\nI need min H such that I can reach y=9 in H steps from y=2.\n\nMinimal H would be 7, since from 2 to 9 is 7 steps up, but I might have to wait or detour due to cars.\n\nBut going up directly might not be possible if at some point the freeway is occupied when I'm there.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway, when it is safe to be on, i.e., when no car covers 0.\n\nBut since cars move, it depends on time.\n\nAlso, since I start at t=6, and I can control when I am on each freeway by choosing when to move.\n\nFor example, I can stay on a freeway or move away.\n\nBut to minimize time, I should only stay when necessary to avoid.\n\nLet's compute for each freeway k, the set of times T when it is unsafe, i.e., 0 is covered by some car on k at T.\n\nThen, I need that when I am on freeway k at time T, it is safe.\n\nNow, time T is in terms of turn number, integer.\n\nt1=6, so T >=6.\n\nLet Δt = T - 6, so Δt >=0 integer.\n\nFor freeway 1 (y=1):\n\nCars:\n\nCar A: Span(T) = [-51 + 4Δt, -40 + 4Δt]\n\n0 covered if -51 + 4Δt <= 0 <= -40 + 4Δt\n\nSo -51 + 4Δt <= 0 and 0 <= -40 + 4Δt\n\nFirst inequality: -51 + 4Δt <= 0 => 4Δt <= 51 => Δt <= 51/4 = 12.75, so Δt <=12 since integer\n\nSecond: 0 <= -40 + 4Δt => 40 <= 4Δt => Δt >= 10\n\nSo for Δt from 10 to 12 inclusive.\n\nSimilarly, Car B: Span(T) = [13 + 4Δt, 24 + 4Δt]\n\n0 covered if 13 + 4Δt <= 0 <= 24 + 4Δt\n\n13 + 4Δt <= 0? 4Δt <= -13? Impossible since Δt >=0, so 13+4Δt >=13>0, so 0 cannot be <= lower bound, so never covered. Lower bound min is 13 at Δt=0, always >0, so 0 never in [13+4Δt, 24+4Δt] since both positive.\n\nSo only Car A can cover 0 on freeway 1, from Δt=10 to 12, i.e., T=16 to 18.\n\nΔt=10,11,12 → T=6+10=16, 17,18.\n\nNow freeway 2 (y=2): one car (48,71,left,24)\n\nSpan(T) = [48 - 24Δt, 71 - 24Δt]\n\n0 covered if 48 - 24Δt <= 0 <= 71 - 24Δt\n\nFirst: 48 - 24Δt <= 0 => 48 <= 24Δt => Δt >= 48/24 = 2\n\nSecond: 0 <= 71 - 24Δt => 24Δt <= 71 => Δt <= 71/24 ≈ 2.958, so Δt <=2\n\nΔt >=2 and Δt <=2, so only Δt=2.\n\nThus T=6+2=8.\n\nBut t1=6, T=8, which is future.\n\nNow, freeway 3 (y=3): car (24,-11,right,36)\n\nSpan(T) = [-11 + 36Δt, 24 + 36Δt]\n\n0 covered if -11 + 36Δt <= 0 <= 24 + 36Δt\n\nFirst: -11 + 36Δt <= 0 => 36Δt <=11 => Δt <=11/36≈0.305, so Δt=0 since Δt>=0 integer\n\nSecond: 0 <= 24 + 36Δt, always true for Δt>=0\n\nSo at Δt=0, T=6, -11 +0 = -11 <=0 <=24, yes 0 in [-11,24]\n\nFor Δt=0: Span(T) = [-11,24] includes 0.\n\nFor Δt=1: [-11+36,24+36]=[25,60], 0 not in, since min 25>0.\n\nSo only at T=6, unsafe.\n\nFreeway 4 (y=4): car (0,-11,right,12)\n\nSpan(T) = [-11 + 12Δt, 12Δt]\n\n0 covered if -11 + 12Δt <= 0 <= 12Δt\n\nFirst: -11 + 12Δt <= 0 => 12Δt <=11 => Δt <=11/12≈0.916, so Δt=0\n\nSecond: 0 <= 12Δt, always for Δt>=0\n\nAt Δt=0, T=6, Span=[-11,0], 0 is included? [left, right], so if right=0, and 0<=0<=0, but 0 is equal to right, so yes, 0 is covered if the interval includes 0.\n\nSimilarly, left <=0<= right.\n\nAt T=6, [-11,0], -11<=0<=0, yes.\n\nFor Δt=1, Span=[-11+12,12]=[1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo only unsafe at T=6.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 5 (y=5): same as freeway 4, car (0,-11,right,12), so only unsafe at T=6.\n\nFreeway 6 (y=6): same, (0,-11,right,12), only unsafe at T=6.\n\nFreeway 7 (y=7): same as freeway 3, car (24,-11,right,36), only unsafe at T=6.\n\nNow freeway 8 (y=8): three cars.\n\nFirst car: (-40,-51,right,4) same as freeway 1 car A, Span(T) = [-51 + 4Δt, -40 + 4Δt]\n\n0 covered for Δt=10 to 12, T=16 to 18.\n\nSecond car: (36,25,right,4) Span(T) = [25 + 4Δt, 36 + 4Δt]\n\nMin 25>0, so never covers 0.\n\nThird car: (0,-11,right,4) Span(T) = [-11 + 4Δt, 4Δt]\n\n0 covered if -11 + 4Δt <= 0 <= 4Δt\n\nFirst: -11 + 4Δt <=0 => 4Δt <=11 => Δt <=11/4=2.75, so Δt<=2\n\nSecond: 0 <= 4Δt, always for Δt>=0\n\nSo for Δt=0,1,2\n\nΔt=0: Span=[-11,0], 0 covered\n\nΔt=1: Span=[-11+4,4]=[-7,4], -7<=0<=4, yes\n\nΔt=2: Span=[-11+8,8]=[-3,8], -3<=0<=8, yes\n\nΔt=3: Span=[-11+12,12]=[1,12], 0 not in\n\nSo unsafe for Δt=0,1,2, T=6,7,8\n\nNow, for freeway 8, unsafe if any car covers 0.\n\nFirst car covers only at T=16-18, which is later.\n\nSecond car never.\n\nThird car covers at T=6,7,8.\n\nSo for freeway 8, unsafe at T=6,7,8 from third car.\n\nAlso at T=16,17,18 from first car, but that might be later.\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway, times when unsafe:\n\ny=1: unsafe at T=16,17,18\n\ny=2: unsafe at T=8\n\ny=3: unsafe at T=6\n\ny=4: unsafe at T=6\n\ny=5: unsafe at T=6\n\ny=6: unsafe at T=6\n\ny=7: unsafe at T=6\n\ny=8: unsafe at T=6,7,8\n\nNow, at time T=6, I am at y=2.\n\nAt T=6, y=2 is freeway 2, which is safe at T=6? Freeway 2 is y=2.\n\nFrom above, y=2 is unsafe only at T=8.\n\nAt T=6, is y=2 safe?\n\nFreeway 2: unsafe only at T=8, so at T=6, it should be safe.\n\nConfirm: at T=6, Δt=0, freeway 2 car: Span=[48,71], which is 48 to 71, both >0, so 0 not covered, yes safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=3 to y=7 are all unsafe at T=6, except y=2.\n\ny=1: safe at T=6, since unsafe only later.\n\ny=8: unsafe at T=6.\n\nNow, I am at y=2 at time T=6.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\ny=9 has no cars, so always safe.\n\nBut I need to be on y=9 at some turn.\n\nThe goal is to reach (0,9), so I need y_{t1+H} =9 for some H.\n\nNow, actions: at each turn, I choose to go up, down, or stay.\n\nTo minimize H, I should go up when possible.\n\nBut I have to avoid being on unsafe freeways at that time.\n\nNow, at T=6, I am on y=2, which is safe.\n\nNow, I can choose action a_6.\n\nIf I go up, a_6=U, then y_7 = y_6 +1 =3\n\nThen at turn T=7, I am on y=3.\n\nNow, what is y=3 at T=7?\n\nFreeway y=3 is unsafe only at T=6, but at T=7, it should be safe.\n\nAt T=7, Δt=1, freeway 3: Span=[-11+36,24+36]=[25,60], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly, if I go down, to y=1, or stay on y=2.\n\nBut going down might not help.\n\nSince I need to go up, and y=3 to y=7 are unsafe at T=6 but safe later.\n\nAt T=6, I can stay on y=2 or move.\n\nBut y=2 will be unsafe at T=8, but that might be later.\n\nLet me list the safety over time.\n\nMake a table for times starting from T=6.\n\nTime T | y=1 | y=2 | y=3 | y=4 | y=5 | y=6 | y=7 | y=8\n\nT=6: y=1 safe (unsafe only later), y=2 safe (unsafe at T=8), y=3 unsafe, y=4 unsafe, y=5 unsafe, y=6 unsafe, y=7 unsafe, y=8 unsafe\n\nT=7: Δt=1\n\ny=1: safe, since unsafe only at 16-18\n\ny=2: car at [48-24,71-24]=[24,47], 0 not covered, safe (unsafe only at T=8)\n\ny=3: [25,60] safe\n\ny=4: car, Span=[-11+12,12]=[1,12], min=1>0, so 0 not covered, safe\n\nSimilarly y=5: same, [1,12] safe\n\ny=6: same, [1,12] safe\n\ny=7: [25,60] safe\n\ny=8: unsafe, from third car, Span=[-11+4,4]=[-7,4], -7<=0<=4, so 0 covered, unsafe\n\nAlso other cars safe.\n\nT=8: Δt=2\n\ny=1: safe\n\ny=2: unsafe, as computed, car [48-48,71-48]=[0,23], 0 covered?

First car not until later.\n\nSo y=8 safe at T=9.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nNow, I need to be on y=9 at the end.\n\ny=9 has no cars, so whenever I am on it, no collision, but I need to reach it.\n\nThe path: I start at T=6 on y=2.\n\nI can choose actions.\n\nI want to go up to y=9 with min steps.\n\nPossible to go up directly if freeways are safe when I am on them.\n\nAt T=6, I am on y=2, safe.\n\nI can go up to y=3 at T=7? Let's see.\n\nIf I take a_6 = U, then y_7 = 3.\n\nAt T=7, I am on y=3.\n\ny=3 at T=7: from above, safe, since unsafe only at T=6.\n\nSimilarly, if I go to y=4 at T=8, etc.\n\nBut let's simulate.\n\nOption 1: go straight up as fast as possible.\n\nStart T=6, y=2.\n\nAction a_6: U, then y_7=3\n\nAt T=7, on y=3: safe (as above)\n\nAction a_7: U, then y_8=4\n\nAt T=8, on y=4: at T=8, y=4 is safe, as above (Span min=13>0)\n\nAction a_8: U, y_9=5\n\nT=9, on y=5: safe\n\na_9: U, y_10=6\n\nT=10, on y=6: at T=10, Δt=4, y=6 car: Span=[-11+12*4,48]=[-11+48,48]=[37,48]? 12*4=48, Span=[-11+48,48]=[37,48], min>0, safe\n\na_10: U, y_11=7\n\nT=11, on y=7: similarly, safe\n\na_11: U, y_12=8\n\nT=12, on y=8: at T=12, Δt=6, y=8 cars.\n\nFirst car: not until T=16, safe\n\nThird car: at Δt=6, Span=[-11+24,24]=[13,24]? -11+4*6=-11+24=13, right=4*6=24, [13,24] min>0, safe\n\nSo safe.\n\na_12: U, y_13=9\n\nThen at T=13, on y=9, no cars, safe, and we reached y=9.\n\nNow, H: from t1=6, actions from a_6 to a_12? Let's see.\n\nActions: a_6, a_7, a_8, a_9, a_10, a_11, a_12: that's 7 actions.\n\ny start: y_6=2\n\nAfter a_6 U: y_7=3\n\na_7 U: y_8=4\n\na_8 U: y_9=5\n\na_9 U: y_10=6\n\na_10 U: y_11=7\n\na_11 U: y_12=8\n\na_12 U: y_13=9\n\nSo after 7 actions, at y_13=9, so H=7.\n\nBut is this possible? We need to check for collision at each step.\n\nAt each turn, when I am on the freeway, it must be safe.\n\nT=6: on y=2, safe\n\nT=7: on y=3, safe (T=7, y=3 safe)\n\nT=8: on y=4, safe\n\nT=9: on y=5, safe\n\nT=10: on y=6, safe\n\nT=11: on y=7, safe\n\nT=12: on y=8, safe as above\n\nT=13: on y=9, safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nBut earlier I thought y=8 unsafe at T=6,7,8, but here at T=12, it is safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=2 unsafe at T=8, but I was not on it at T=8.\n\nIn this path, I was on y=2 at T=6, then moved up.\n\nAt T=8, I was on y=4, not y=2.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nIs there a problem at the beginning?\n\nAt T=6, y=3 is unsafe, but I was not on it; I started on y=2.\n\nIn this sequence, all seems fine.\n\nBut let me confirm the car on freeway 8 at T=12.\n\nT=12, Δt=6\n\nThird car: Span=[-11 + 4*6, 4*6] = [-11+24, 24] = [13,24], 0 not in, yes.\n\nFirst car: not relevant.\n\nSo safe.\n\nThus with H=7, I can reach in 7 steps: all actions U.\n\nBut the problem is to output the sequence.\n\nIn the answer, it should be actions from t=6 to t=6+H-1.\n\nH=7, actions from t=6 to t=12? t=6 to t=6+6=12? Let's index.\n\nt1=6, actions a_t for t from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nSo a_6 to a_{6+7-1} = a_6 to a_12.\n\nAnd y_{13} =9.\n\nIn the sequence, turn t: a_t\n\nSo for turn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\n...\n\nUp to turn 12: U\n\nBut is there any issue at y=2 at T=8? I was not there.\n\nAnother thing: at T=8, y=2 is unsafe, and y=8 is unsafe, but I was on y=4.\n\nNow, but in the sequence above, I used 7 steps to go from 2 to 9.\n\nSince I start at 2, need to go to 9, difference 7, so min should be 7 if no waiting.\n\nHere it seems possible.\n\nBut let me check if at any point I need to wait.\n\nFor example, if I were to be on y=3 at T=6, but I'm not.\n\nPerhaps I can go faster? But 7 is minimal since 7 steps needed.\n\nUnless I start at 2, after 0 actions, y=2, not 9; after 1 action, y=3; ... after 7 actions, y=9.\n\nYes.\n\nBut in the car states, is there any car that might affect later?\n\nFor example, on freeway 1, unsafe at T=16-18, but that is far, and I will be at y=9 by T=13, so no issue.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nBut in this path, I reached at T=13.\n\nPerhaps I can reach earlier? No, from y=2 to y=9, min 7 steps.\n\nAfter H actions, y_{t1+H} = y_{6+H}\n\nSet equal to 9.\n\ny_6=2, so y_{6+H} =2 + number of U minus number of D, since S no change.\n\nTo reach 9, net +7, so min H=7 with all U.\n\nIf I do some D or S, H larger.\n\nSo here it works with all U.\n\nBut in the sequence, at T=7, I am on y=3, which is safe.\n\nBut earlier I thought y=3 unsafe only at T=6.\n\nT=7 is safe.\n\nSimilarly all.\n\nBut let me double-check freeway 3 at T=7.\n\nFreeway 3: car at T=7, Δt=1, Span=[-11+36,24+36]=[25,60], 0 not in, yes.\n\nSimilarly, at T=8, y=4: Span=[-11+24,24]=[13,24]? For y=4 car, s=12, Δt=2, Span=[-11+12*2, 12*2]=[-11+24,24]=[13,24], yes min 13>0.\n\nAll good.\n\nBut the player position: when I move, at turn T, I am on y_T, and I choose action to set y_{T+1}.\n\nIn terms of collision, only when on the freeway at that turn.\n\nIn this case, for the path: at T=6, on y=2, action U, set y_7=3\n\nT=7, on y=3, action U, set y_8=4\n\nT=8, on y=4, action U, set y_9=5\n\nT=9, on y=5, action U, set y_10=6\n\nT=10, on y=6, action U, set y_11=7\n\nT=11, on y=7, action U, set y_12=8\n\nT=12, on y=8, action U, set y_13=9\n\nNow, at each of these, the freeway was safe when I was on it.\n\ny=8 at T=12 is safe.\n\nBut earlier for y=8, I thought unsafe at T=6,7,8, but T=12 is later.\n\nT=12 is fine.\n\nPerhaps I should confirm with the third car on y=8.\n\nAt T=8, Δt=2, Span=[-11+8,8]=[-3,8], includes 0, unsafe.\n\nBut at T=12, Δt=6, Span=[-11+24,24]=[13,24], not include 0.\n\nYes.\n\nSo all clear.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 7, with all actions U.\n\nBut the answer should be the sequence.\n\nBut let me see if I can do with less? No, impossible to reach faster.\n\nPerhaps I can go up faster, but no.\n\nAnother thing: at T=6, I am on y=2, which is safe, but if I go up, I go to y=3 at T=7, safe.\n\nCould I stay or go down to avoid something? But no need, since I can go directly.\n\nBut in this case, it works.\n\nPerhaps for other freeways, but I think it's fine.\n\nBut let me check freeway 2 at T=8 unsafe, but I was not there.\n\nNow, the problem is to output the actions.\n\nSo sequence:\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nBut H=7, actions from t=6 to t=12, that's 7 actions: t=6,7,8,9,10,11,12.\n\nt=6 to t=12 inclusive is 7 turns.\n\nAnd after last action at t=12, position y_13=9.\n\nYes.\n\nBut in the answer format, it should be like:\n\n\\boxed{\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\n}\n\nBut is there any mistake?\n\nI recall that for freeway 4,5,6, at T=6, they are unsafe, but I was not on them at T=6; I was on y=2.\n\nIn the sequence, I pass through them later when safe.\n\nFor example, at T=8, I am on y=4, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider if at some point I have to be on a freeway when it is unsafe, but in this path, no.\n\nAnother thing: the car on freeway 2 at T=8 is unsafe, but since I am not there, fine.\n\nBut let me see if I can reach earlier, but no.\n\nPerhaps I can start by going down or something, but that would take more turns, worse.\n\nSo this should be minimal.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\", and here H=7.\n\nBut in the car states, for freeway 8, there is a car that might be issue, but not at this time.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the position at turn T.\n\nAnother point: when I am on y=8 at T=12, and I go to y=9, at T=12 I am on y=8, which is safe, then I move to y=9 at T=13.\n\nT=13 I am on y=9, no issue.\n\nNow, but in the answer, I think this is fine.\n\nBut let me confirm the initial position.\n\nAt turn t1=6, player position (0,2), so on freeway 2.\n\nThen I take actions.\n\nPerhaps I need to output for each turn starting from t1.\n\nIn the sequence, for turn t, action a_t.\n\nSo for turn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\n...\n\nUp to turn 12: U\n\nThen done.\n\nH=7.\n\nBut the answer should be in a box.\n\nPerhaps I should write it.\n\nBut is there any reason why I cannot go up directly?\n\nFor example, at T=6, if I go up, to y=3, but at T=6, y=3 is unsafe, but I go to y=3 at T=7, not at T=6.\n\nAt turn T=6, I am on y=2, I choose action U, which means at the end of turn 6, I move to y=3, so at turn 7, I start on y=3.\n\nSo at turn 6, I am on y=2, no issue.\n\nAt turn 7, I am on y=3, which is safe as per above.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 7 or others, but I think it's fine.\n\nAnother thing: in freeway 8, at T=7, it is unsafe, but I am not there until T=12.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 7 with all U actions.\n\nBut let me see the car on freeway 1, but not relevant.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if I need to avoid y=8 at earlier times, but I don't.\n\nSo I think this is correct.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 2)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 6\\) is 7. The sequence of actions consists entirely of \"U\" (up) moves, as this direct upward path avoids all collisions with cars on the freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) during the turns when the player is present on those freeways.\n\n### Verification of Collision Avoidance:\n- At turn \\(T = 6\\), the player is on freeway \\(y = 2\\), which is safe (no car covers position 0).\n- At turn \\(T = 7\\), the player is on freeway \\(y = 3\\), which is safe (car on \\(y = 3\\) does not cover 0 at \\(T = 7\\)).\n- At turn \\(T = 8\\), the player is on freeway \\(y = 4\\), which is safe (car on \\(y = 4\\) does not cover 0 at \\(T = 8\\)).\n- At turn \\(T = 9\\), the player is on freeway \\(y = 5\\), which is safe (car on \\(y = 5\\) does not cover 0 at \\(T = 9\\)).\n- At turn \\(T = 10\\), the player is on freeway \\(y = 6\\), which is safe (car on \\(y = 6\\) does not cover 0 at \\(T = 10\\)).\n- At turn \\(T = 11\\), the player is on freeway \\(y = 7\\), which is safe (car on \\(y = 7\\) does not cover 0 at \\(T = 11\\)).\n- At turn \\(T = 12\\), the player is on freeway \\(y = 8\\), which is safe (cars on \\(y = 8\\) do not cover 0 at \\(T = 12\\)).\n- At turn \\(T = 13\\), the player reaches \\(y = 9\\), which has no cars and is always safe.\n\n### Action Sequence:\nThe sequence of actions from turn \\(t_1 = 6\\) to turn \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 12\\) is as follows:\n\n- Turn 6: Move up (\\(U\\)), resulting in position \\((0, 3)\\) at turn 7.\n- Turn 7: Move up (\\(U\\)), resulting in position \\((0, 4)\\) at turn 8.\n- Turn 8: Move up (\\(U\\)), resulting in position \\((0, 5)\\) at turn 9.\n- Turn 9: Move up (\\(U\\)), resulting in position \\((0, 6)\\) at turn 10.\n- Turn 10: Move up (\\(U\\)), resulting in position \\((0, 7)\\) at turn 11.\n- Turn 11: Move up (\\(U\\)), resulting in position \\((0, 8)\\) at turn 12.\n- Turn 12: Move up (\\(U\\)), resulting in position \\((0, 9)\\) at turn 13.\n\nThis sequence achieves the goal in the minimal \\(H = 7\\) turns.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 6: U \\\\\nTurn 7: U \\\\\nTurn 8: U \\\\\nTurn 9: U \\\\\nTurn 10: U \\\\\nTurn 11: U \\\\\nTurn 12: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to get the player from (0,3) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t₁ = 7.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing y by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars move on specific freeways, and I need to avoid being on a freeway when a car's span includes x=0 at that turn. The collision check is only for the freeway I'm on at that exact turn.\n\nThe car spans are given at turn t₁=7, and for future turns, they move based on their speed and direction.\n\nLet me list all the cars for each freeway at t=7:\n\n- Freeway 1: two cars\n  - Car 1: head -36, tail -47, direction right, speed 4. Since it's right-moving, the span is [tail, head] = [-47, -36] at t=7? No, let's read carefully.\n\nThe notation says: for left-moving, span is [h, τ], and for right-moving, it's [τ, h]. But in the car state, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nFor freeway 1:\n- First car: head -36, tail -47, direction right, speed 4.\n  Since direction is right, and for right-moving, span is [tail, head] = [-47, -36] at t=7.\n- Second car: head 28, tail 17, direction right, speed 4. So span [17, 28] at t=7.\n\nDirection right, so moving right, meaning increasing x.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: one car, head 24, tail 47, direction left, speed 24.\nDirection left, so for left-moving, span is [h, τ] = [24, 47]? But head and tail: it says head 24, tail 47, and direction left.\n\nI need to clarify the head and tail.\n\nTypically, head is the front, tail is the back. For a left-moving car, if it's moving left, head should be on the right if x increases to the right.\n\nAssume x-axis increases to the right.\n\nFor a left-moving car (direction left), it's moving to decreasing x, so the head (front) has higher x, tail has lower x. So span [head, tail] might not be in order; but the notation says for left-moving: span is [h, τ], which might imply h is the right end, τ is the left end.\n\nIn the car state, it's given as (head, tail, dir, speed), so for dir left, head is the position of the front, which is the right end if moving left.\n\nThen for left-moving, span is [h, τ] but since h > τ if moving left, [h, τ] would be from high to low, but in terms of interval, it's from τ to h, but τ is smaller.\n\nI think it's better to think of the span as the range of x covered.\n\nFor freeway 2: head 24, tail 47, direction left, speed 24.\n\nSince direction left, and head is 24, tail is 47? That seems inconsistent because if head is front and moving left, head should be greater than tail, but 24 < 47, so perhaps tail is larger? I think there might be confusion in notation.\n\nLook back at the problem:\n\nFor left-moving: \"Span(t₁) = [h, τ]\" and it moves to [h - s(T-t₁), τ - s(T-t₁)]\n\nFor right-moving: \"Span(t₁) = [τ, h]\" to [τ + s(T-t₁), h + s(T-t₁)]\n\nIn the car state, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed)\n\nFor freeway 1, first car: head -36, tail -47, direction right.\n\nSince direction right, span is [τ, h] = [-47, -36]\n\nSimilarly, second car: head 28, tail 17, direction right. Tail 17, head 28, so [17,28]\n\nFor freeway 2: head 24, tail 47, direction left.\n\nDirection left, so for left-moving, span is [h, τ] = [24, 47]\n\nBut 24 to 47, and since moving left, decreasing x.\n\nIn general, for left-moving, the span [h, τ] with h and τ such that h > τ if moving left, but here head 24, tail 47, 24 < 47, so τ > h, which means for left-moving, if τ > h, then [h, τ] is from low to high, but moving left should have decreasing x, so the position should decrease over time.\n\nPerhaps the head and tail are labeled based on the car's orientation, not the x-value.\n\nI think it's safer to go by the span definition given.\n\nFor left-moving car at time t, span is [h, τ], and at time T, it's [h - s(T-t), τ - s(T-t)]\n\nSimilarly for right-moving, [τ, h] at t, [τ + s(T-t), h + s(T-t)] at T.\n\nThe values h and τ are positions at time t.\n\nFor freeway 2: at t=7, head=24, tail=47, direction left, so span [h, τ] = [24, 47] at t=7.\n\nSince moving left, at time T, positions decrease.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFreeway 3: head 60, tail 25, direction right, speed 36. Direction right, so span [τ, h] = [25, 60] at t=7.\n\nFreeway 4: head 12, tail 1, direction right, speed 12. Span [1,12] at t=7.\n\nFreeway 5: same as 4? head 12, tail 1, direction right, speed 12. Identical to freeway 4? But different freeway, so different cars I assume.\n\nFreeway 6: same, head 12, tail 1, direction right, speed 12. So all three are the same.\n\nFreeway 7: head 60, tail 25, direction right, speed 36. Same as freeway 3.\n\nFreeway 8: three cars:\n- First: head -36, tail -47, direction right, speed 4. Span [-47, -36] for right-moving.\n- Second: head 40, tail 29, direction right, speed 4. Span [29,40]\n- Third: head 4, tail -7, direction right, speed 4. Span [-7,4]\n\nNow, collision occurs if at turn T, the player is on freeway y, and for some car on that freeway, 0 is in the span at that turn. Meaning the car covers x=0 at time T.\n\nThe player is on a freeway only when y between 1 and 8, I think. y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, I assume safe.\n\nThe goal is (0,9), which is above the freeways.\n\nPlayer starts at (0,3) at turn t=7.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\ny=9 is the top, probably safe.\n\nNow, actions: U, D, S.\n\nMinimal turns to reach y=9 from y=3. The difference is 6, so if I could go up every turn, it would take 6 turns. But I might need to wait or go down to avoid cars.\n\nSo I need to simulate the car positions over time to see when it's safe to be on each row.\n\nSince cars move continuously, I need to find for each freeway and each turn, if there is a car covering x=0.\n\nThen, for the player path, when on y=1 to 8 at turn T, it must not be that for that y and T, 0 is covered by a car on that freeway.\n\nAlso, note that when moving, at turn T, after action, y_{T} is the position, and I am on freeway y_T if 1<= y_T <=8.\n\nIf I move to a different y, at turn T, I am on y_T only at that turn, not on the intermediate.\n\nThe note says: if at turn T, I decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T, then at turn T, I am on y_T, and at T+1 on y_{T+1}, so for collision at T, it's based on y_T, and at T+1 based on y_{T+1}.\n\nNo issue with moving through; only the position at the end of the turn matters for collision.\n\nNow, let's denote the time from t=7 onwards.\n\nSet τ = T - 7, so at τ=0, it's turn 7.\n\nFor each freeway k, and for each τ >=0, I need to know if at time 7+τ, there is a car on k that has 0 in its span.\n\nThat is, for some car on k, the span at time 7+τ includes 0.\n\nThen, for the player, at turn 7+τ, if y_τ is between 1 and 8, and for that freeway, 0 is covered, then collision.\n\ny_τ is the position after action at turn 7+τ, I think. Let's see the update.\n\nPlayer update: at turn t, action a_t determines y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with Δy based on a_t.\n\nThe sequence: at turn t, we choose action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nThe position is given for turn t, I think.\n\nIn the state, at turn t_1=7, player position is (0,3), so y_{t_1} = 3.\n\nThen, for turn t, y_t is the position at the start of turn t? But collision is during the turn or at the end?\n\nThe collision definition: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd y_T is the player position at turn T.\n\nIn the player update, y_{t+1} is after action at t.\n\nI need to clarify the timing.\n\nLet me read carefully.\n\n\"Player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, where Δy_t depends on a_t\"\n\nAnd a_t is action at turn t.\n\nSo at turn t, we choose a_t, which sets y_{t+1}.\n\nThen, at turn t, what is the position? I think y_t is the position at the beginning of turn t.\n\nThen, during turn t, we choose action, which affects y_{t+1}.\n\nBut for collision, it says \"at turn T\", and \"y_T\" is the position, I think at that turn.\n\nPerhaps it's better to think that at each turn T, the player has a position y_T, and for that T, if on freeway, we check cars for that T.\n\nIn the update, y_t is defined, and a_t is chosen to set y_{t+1}.\n\nFor turn T, position y_T is given, and we check collision based on y_T and cars at T.\n\nThen we choose a_t to set y_{t+1} for the next turn.\n\nIn this case, at turn t, position y_t is fixed, we choose a_t to move to y_{t+1}.\n\nCollision is checked at each turn based on y_t and cars at t.\n\nThe note says: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nThis implies that at turn T, you are on y_T, not on y_{T+1} yet.\n\nSo, for collision at turn T, it's based on y_T and the cars at time T.\n\ny_T is the position during turn T, before action or after? I think it's the position at the start of turn T.\n\nBut for the car span, at time T, it's defined.\n\nSo, for turn T, position y_T, and cars at time T.\n\nThen, after choosing action, y_{T+1} is set.\n\nStart at turn t₁=7, y_7 = 3.\n\nWe need to reach y_{t} = 9 for some t, and we want minimal H such that after H-1 actions, y_{t₁ + H - 1} = 9? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence of actions from t= t₁ to t= t₁ + H - 1, so H actions, but the position after H actions is y_{t₁ + H}.\n\nDefine.\n\nAt time t, position y_t.\n\nAt turn t, we choose a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nThe sequence of actions for t from t₁ to t₁ + H - 1, so H actions.\n\nThen after H actions, y_{t₁ + H} is set.\n\nWe want y_{t₁ + H} = 9.\n\nAnd we need the path from t₁ to t₁ + H with no collision at any turn t from t₁ to t₁ + H - 1, I think, because at each turn t, we have y_t, and if 1<= y_t <=8, we check collision at t.\n\nAt turn t₁ + H, if we reach y_{t₁ + H} = 9, and 9 is not a freeway, so no collision check, I assume.\n\nSimilarly, at start, y_{t₁} =3, which is freeway 3, so we need to check collision at t=7 for y=3.\n\nBut at t=7, the cars are given, so we need to ensure that at t=7, for y=3, no car covers 0.\n\nSimilarly for each turn.\n\nSo, for the player, at each turn t from t₁ onwards, y_t must be such that if 1<= y_t <=8, then for freeway y_t, at time t, no car has 0 in its span.\n\nThen we choose a_t to set y_{t+1}.\n\nWe start with y_{t₁} given.\n\nWe want to achieve y_{t} =9 for some t, with minimal t - t₁, I think, or minimal number of actions.\n\nThe minimal H such that after H actions, y_{t₁ + H} =9.\n\nH is the number of turns from t₁ to t₁ + H -1, so H actions, position at t₁ + H.\n\nMinimal H means reaching faster.\n\nSince we start at t₁, and we need to reach by some turn, minimal H means fewest actions to reach y=9.\n\nBut we might need to wait, so H could be larger than 6.\n\nNow, first, let's check at t=7, for each freeway, if 0 is covered.\n\nTime t=7.\n\nFreeway 1: cars:\n- Car1: right-moving, span [τ, h] = [-47, -36] at t=7. 0 not in [-47,-36], since -36 <0? -36 is less than 0, -36 <0, -47< -36<0, so all negative, 0 not in span.\n\n- Car2: [17,28], 17 to 28, all positive, 0 not in.\n\nSo for freeway 1, at t=7, no car at 0.\n\nFreeway 2: one car, left-moving, span [h, τ] = [24,47] at t=7. 24 to 47, all >0, 0 not in span.\n\nFreeway 3: right-moving, span [τ, h] = [25,60] at t=7, all >0, 0 not in.\n\nFreeway 4: right-moving, [1,12], 1 to 12, includes 0? 1 to 12, 0 not in, since 1>0.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 5: same as 4, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nFreeway 6: same, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nFreeway 7: same as 3, [25,60], 0 not in.\n\nFreeway 8: three cars:\n- Car1: [-47,-36], right-moving, 0 not in.\n- Car2: [29,40], 0 not in.\n- Car3: [-7,4], right-moving, span [-7,4], which includes 0, since -7 <=0<=4.\n\nAt t=7, for freeway 8, car3 has span [-7,4], which includes 0.\n\nSo at t=7, on freeway 8, 0 is covered.\n\nBut player is at y=3, freeway 3, which is safe at t=7.\n\nNow, we need to go to y=9.\n\nThe direct way is to go up, but we need to avoid being on a row when a car is at 0.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway and for future times, when 0 is covered.\n\nSince the cars move at constant speed, I can find for each car the times when it covers 0.\n\nThen for each freeway, the set of times when some car on it covers 0.\n\nThen for the player, when on that freeway at that time, collision.\n\nFor freeway k, the \"danger times\" when 0 is covered.\n\nThen player should not be on k at those times.\n\nNow, let's compute for each freeway.\n\nFirst, define time from t=7, so let τ = T - 7.\n\nFor each car, at time 7+τ, the span.\n\nFor a car, given at t=7, head and tail, direction, speed.\n\nFor right-moving car: span at time 7+τ is [τ + s*τ, h + s*τ]? Let's see.\n\nAt time T, for right-moving car, span at T is [τ + s*(T-7), h + s*(T-7)]? No.\n\nAt time T, for right-moving: [τ + s*(T - t₁), h + s*(T - t₁)] since t₁=7.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving: [h - s*(T - t₁), τ - s*(T - t₁)]\n\nThen 0 in span if min <= 0 <= max of the span.\n\nNow for each freeway.\n\nFreeway 1: two cars.\n\nCar1: right-moving, τ = -47, h = -36, s=4.\n\nSpan at T: [ -47 + 4*(T-7) , -36 + 4*(T-7) ]\n\n0 in span if -47 + 4Δτ <= 0 <= -36 + 4Δτ, where Δτ = T-7.\n\nSince the span is increasing, 0 in it when min <=0 and max >=0, but min and max depend.\n\n-47 + 4Δτ <= 0 <= -36 + 4Δτ\n\nFirst inequality: -47 + 4Δτ <= 0 => 4Δτ <= 47 => Δτ <= 47/4 = 11.75\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= -36 + 4Δτ => 4Δτ >= 36 => Δτ >= 9\n\nSo for Δτ from 9 to 11.75, 0 in span for car1.\n\nBut Δτ integer since turns are discrete, so Δτ =9,10,11.\n\nT=16,17,18.\n\nSimilarly, car2: right-moving, τ=17, h=28, s=4.\n\nSpan at T: [17 + 4Δτ, 28 + 4Δτ], both positive for Δτ>=0, so 0 not in span, since min 17>0.\n\nSo for freeway 1, only car1 can cover 0, at T=16,17,18 (Δτ=9,10,11)\n\nT=7+9=16, 7+10=17, 7+11=18.\n\nNow freeway 2: one car, left-moving, h=24, τ=47, s=24? Head=24, tail=47, direction left.\n\nSpan at t=7: [h, τ] = [24,47]\n\nAt time T: [h - sΔτ, τ - sΔτ] = [24 - 24Δτ, 47 - 24Δτ]\n\n0 in span if min <=0<=max, but since left-moving and decreasing, min is 24-24Δτ, max is 47-24Δτ.\n\n24-24Δτ <= 0 <= 47-24Δτ\n\nFirst: 24-24Δτ <=0 => 24 <= 24Δτ => Δτ >=1\n\nSecond: 0 <= 47-24Δτ => 24Δτ <=47 => Δτ <= 47/24 ≈ 1.958\n\nSo Δτ =1, since Δτ integer, Δτ=1, T=8.\n\nAt T=8, 24-24=0, 47-24=23, so [0,23], 0 included.\n\nAt Δτ=2, 24-48= -24, 47-48= -1, both negative, 0 not in.\n\nSo for freeway 2, danger at T=8.\n\nNow freeway 3: right-moving, τ=25, h=60, s=36.\n\nSpan at T: [25 + 36Δτ, 60 + 36Δτ], all positive, min 25>0, so 0 never in span.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 4: right-moving, τ=1, h=12, s=12.\n\nSpan at T: [1 + 12Δτ, 12 + 12Δτ], min at Δτ=0 is 1>0, so always positive, 0 never in span.\n\nFreeway 5: same as 4, 0 never in span.\n\nFreeway 6: same, 0 never.\n\nFreeway 7: same as 3, 0 never.\n\nNow freeway 8: three cars.\n\nCar1: right-moving, τ=-47, h=-36, s=4, same as freeway1 car1.\n\nSpan at T: [-47 +4Δτ, -36 +4Δτ]\n\n0 in span when -47+4Δτ <=0 <= -36+4Δτ\n\nAs before, Δτ=9,10,11, T=16,17,18.\n\nCar2: right-moving, τ=29, h=40, s=4? Head=40, tail=29, direction right, so τ=29, h=40, s=4.\n\nSpan at T: [29 +4Δτ, 40 +4Δτ], min 29>0, so 0 never in span.\n\nCar3: right-moving, head=4, tail=-7, direction right, so τ=-7, h=4, s=4.\n\nSpan at T: [-7 +4Δτ, 4 +4Δτ]\n\n0 in span if -7 +4Δτ <=0 <= 4 +4Δτ\n\nFirst: -7+4Δτ <=0 => 4Δτ <=7 => Δτ <=7/4=1.75\n\nSecond: 0 <=4 +4Δτ always true since Δτ>=0.\n\nAnd -7+4Δτ <=0 for Δτ <=1.75, so for Δτ=0,1 since integer.\n\nΔτ=0: T=7, span [-7,4], includes 0.\n\nΔτ=1: T=8, span [-7+4,4+4] = [-3,8], includes 0.\n\nΔτ=2: [-7+8,4+8]=[1,12], min=1>0, 0 not included.\n\nSo for car3, 0 in span at T=7 and T=8.\n\nTherefore, for freeway 8:\n\n- At T=7: car3 covers 0, as we saw.\n\n- At T=8: car3 covers 0.\n\n- Also at T=16,17,18 car1 covers 0, but later.\n\nBut for now, near future.\n\nSo danger times for each freeway:\n\n- Freeway 1: danger at T=16,17,18\n\n- Freeway 2: danger at T=8\n\n- Freeway 3: safe always\n\n- Freeway 4: safe always\n\n- Freeway 5: safe always\n\n- Freeway 6: safe always\n\n- Freeway 7: safe always\n\n- Freeway 8: danger at T=7,8, and also T=16,17,18 but T=7 and 8 are immediate.\n\nPlayer starts at t=7, y=3.\n\nFreeway 3 is safe at all times, since no car covers 0 ever.\n\nSimilarly, 4,5,6,7 safe.\n\nFreeway 2 has danger at T=8.\n\nFreeway 8 has danger at T=7 and T=8.\n\nAt t=7, player is on y=3, freeway 3, which is safe, no issue.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nPossible actions: U, D, S.\n\nIf we go up at t=7, a_7=U, then y_{8} = y_7 +1 =3+1=4.\n\nThen at t=8, y=4, freeway 4, which is safe always, so no collision.\n\nThen we can keep going up.\n\nBut let's see the danger.\n\nAt t=8, if we are on freeway 2, it would be dangerous, but we are on 4, safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8 dangerous at t=8, but we not on it.\n\nSo from y=3 at t=7, go U to y=4 at t=8.\n\nAt t=8, y=4, safe.\n\nThen at t=8, we can go U again to y=5 at t=9.\n\ny=5 freeway 5, safe.\n\nSimilarly, U to y=6 at t=10, safe.\n\nU to y=7 at t=11, safe.\n\nU to y=8 at t=12.\n\nNow at t=12, y=8, freeway 8.\n\nBut freeway 8 has danger times: at T=7,8,16,17,18.\n\nAt T=12, which is Δτ=5, not a danger time, so should be safe.\n\nConfirm: at T=12, Δτ=5.\n\nFreeway 8 cars:\n\nCar1: span [-47 +4*5, -36 +4*5] = [-47+20, -36+20] = [-27,-16], not include 0.\n\nCar2: [29+20,40+20]=[49,60], no.\n\nCar3: [-7+20,4+20]=[13,24], no, all >0.\n\nSo safe.\n\nThen from y=8 at t=12, go U to y=9 at t=13.\n\ny=9, not a freeway, safe.\n\nSo in 6 actions: from t=7 to t=12, actions at t=7,8,9,10,11,12 to go up each time, reaching y=9 at t=13.\n\nH is the number of turns? Let's see the sequence.\n\nStart: turn t=7, y=3.\n\nAfter action a_7, y_8 set.\n\nAfter a_8, y_9 set, and so on.\n\nWe want y_t =9 for some t.\n\nHere, after 6 actions: a_7 to a_12, y_{13} =9.\n\nt= t₁ + H, with H=6? t₁=7, t=13, so 13-7=6, so H=6 actions.\n\nThe minimal possible is 6, since from 3 to 9, 6 steps up.\n\nAnd in this path, no collision: at t=7, y=3 safe; t=8, y=4 safe; ... t=12, y=8 safe (since not danger time for freeway 8); t=13, y=9 safe.\n\nBut at t=8, freeway 8 is dangerous, but player is on y=4, not y=8, so ok.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2 dangerous at t=8, but player on y=4, not y=2.\n\nSo this seems fine.\n\nBut is there any issue?\n\nPlayer starts at t=7, y=3.\n\nAction a_7=U, then y_8=4.\n\nAt t=8, y=4, which is freeway 4, safe.\n\nThen a_8=U, y_9=5, and so on.\n\nAll good.\n\nBut let me confirm the freeway 8 at t=12, safe, as above.\n\nPerhaps I can go faster, but 6 is minimal.\n\nBut what about at t=7, if I go down or something, but that would take more turns, worse.\n\nOr stay, but staying doesn't help, since I need to go up.\n\nIn this case, no need to avoid, since all rows I use are safe at those times.\n\nBut freeway 2 is dangerous at t=8, but I don't go there.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8 dangerous at t=7 and 8, but I am on 3 and then 4.\n\nAt t=7, I am on 3, which is fine.\n\nIs there a reason to wait or go down? For example, if I wanted to go to y=2 or y=8 at some point, but I don't need to.\n\nBut in this path, I go directly up through y=4,5,6,7,8, all safe at the times I am there.\n\ny=4 to 8 are always safe, since no cars cover 0 ever for freeways 4,5,6,7.\n\nFreeway 3 also safe.\n\nOnly freeways 1,2,8 have danger times, but not when I am there.\n\nIn my path, I am never on freeway 1,2, or 8 at danger times.\n\nAt t=12, on freeway 8, but not danger time.\n\nSo H=6, actions: all U.\n\nBut let me write the sequence.\n\nTurn t_1 =7: a_{7} = U\n\nThen y_8=4\n\nTurn t_1 +1 =8: a_{8} = U, y_9=5\n\nTurn 9: a_9=U, y_{10}=6\n\nTurn 10: a_{10}=U, y_{11}=7\n\nTurn 11: a_{11}=U, y_{12}=8\n\nTurn 12: a_{12}=U, y_{13}=9\n\nSo actions from t=7 to t=12, 6 actions.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be from turn t_1 to t_1 + H-1.\n\nH is the minimal number of turns, I think.\n\nThe problem says: \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}_{t=0}^{H-1}\"\n\nIn the sequence, t from 0 to H-1, so actions for turns t_1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nSo for t=0, turn t_1, a_{t_1}\n\nt=1, turn t_1+1, a_{t_1+1}\n\n...\n\nt=H-1, turn t_1 + H -1, a_{t_1 + H -1}\n\nThen after that, y_{t_1 + H} is set to 9.\n\nIn this case, H=6, actions at turns 7,8,9,10,11,12, all U.\n\ny_{13}=9.\n\nIs there a way with H=5?\n\nWith 5 actions, from y=3, after 5 ups, y=8, but we need y=9, so not reached.\n\nIf I go up faster, but I can only go one step per turn, so minimum 6 steps to increase by 6.\n\nUnless I start from higher, but I start from 3.\n\nSo H=6 is minimal.\n\nBut perhaps I can reach earlier by going down first or something, but that doesn't help.\n\nFor example, at t=7, if I go down to y=2, but y=2 at t=7.\n\nt=7, y=2: freeway 2.\n\nAt t=7, freeway 2: car span [24,47], all >0, 0 not in, so safe? Earlier we computed for freeway 2, danger only at t=8.\n\nAt t=7, freeway 2: span [24,47], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nBut at t=8, dangerous.\n\nSo if at t=7, I go D to y=2 at t=8? Action at t=7: if a_7=D, then y_8 = y_7 -1 =3-1=2.\n\nThen at t=8, y=2, freeway 2, which is dangerous at t=8, collision.\n\nSo cannot.\n\nIf I go S at t=7, y_8=3, still on freeway 3, safe, but I wasted a turn, then I need to go up later, so H larger.\n\nNot better.\n\nSimilarly, going to other rows not necessary.\n\nSo the direct up path seems best.\n\nBut in the car list, freeway 4,5,6 all have cars, but they never cover 0, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3,7 safe.\n\nBut in my path, I go through y=4,5,6,7,8.\n\ny=7 is freeway 7, which is safe.\n\nAt t=12, y=8, freeway 8, safe as computed.\n\nBut earlier I thought freeway 8 has cars, but at t=12, no issue.\n\nPerhaps I should check if there are other dangers.\n\nFor example, freeway 1 danger at t=16,17,18, which is later, not relevant.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8 danger at t=16,17,18, but at t=12, fine.\n\nSo with H=6, it works.\n\nBut the problem is to output the sequence.\n\nIn the answer, it should be for each turn.\n\nBut in the sequence, for turn t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nH=6, turns 7 to 12.\n\nActions all U.\n\nBut let me confirm if at t=7, on y=3, is it safe? Freeway 3, no car covers 0, yes.\n\nt=8, y=4, freeway 4, safe.\n\nt=9, y=5, freeway 5, safe.\n\nt=10, y=6, freeway 6, safe.\n\nt=11, y=7, freeway 7, safe.\n\nt=12, y=8, freeway 8, at t=12, as above, no car at 0, safe.\n\nThen y_13=9.\n\nPerfect.\n\nBut in the car for freeway 8, car3 at t=7 and t=8 covers 0, but we are not on it.\n\nAt t=12, fine.\n\nPerhaps I can reach in fewer turns by going to y=9 directly, but not possible.\n\nOr, is there a way to jump? No.\n\nAnother thing: the vertical axis y=0 to 9, and freeways 1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, so when on y=0 or y=9, no collision possible.\n\nIn this case, we start from y=3, end at y=9.\n\nIf I go to y=0, I could stay there, but that takes more time.\n\nNot useful.\n\nSo I think H=6 with all U is fine.\n\nBut let me see the answer format.\n\nIt should be boxed with the actions.\n\nBut in the sequence, it should be for turns starting from t_1.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} = U\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1} = U\n\n...\n\nUp to turn t_1 + 5: a_{t_1 + 5} = U\n\nSince H=6, t from 0 to 5.\n\nTurn t_1 + 0: a_{7} = U\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{8} = U\n\n...\n\nTurn t_1 + 5: a_{12} = U\n\nThen y_{13}=9.\n\nBut in the sequence, it should be written as:\n\nTurn 7: a_7\n\nTurn 8: a_8\n\netc.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut in the problem, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc., so I need to use the variable.\n\nIn the answer, it should be with t_1.\n\nBut since t_1=7, but I think we should write with t_1.\n\nIn the format: \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc.\n\nSo I think:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } t_1: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 1: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 2: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 3: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 4: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 5: U \\end{array} }\n\nBut H=6, so up to t_1 + 5.\n\nt from 0 to H-1=5.\n\nYes.\n\nTo be precise.\n\nPerhaps I should check if at some point, when moving, but no, the collision is only at the position at that turn.\n\nAnother thing: the cars on freeway 4,5,6 all have the same car? But different freeways, so separate.\n\nBut since they never cover 0, fine.\n\nFreeway 4: car at [1,12] at t=7, moving right, so at later times, [1+12Δτ, 12+12Δτ], always min >0, so never at 0.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=6 with all up actions.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H\", and in the sequence, it should be clear.\n\nPerhaps I need to output H and the sequence.\n\nIn the box, it should be the sequence as specified.\n\nBut in the answer format, it shows the actions per turn.\n\nSo I think that's it.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position \\((0, 3)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 7\\) and needs to reach \\((0, 9)\\) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\), avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\nThe minimal \\(H\\) is 6, as it requires exactly 6 upward moves to increase the y-coordinate from 3 to 9. The sequence of actions consists solely of \"U\" (up) moves for each turn from \\(t_1\\) to \\(t_1 + 5\\).\n\n### Collision Avoidance Justification:\n- At turn \\(t = 7\\), the player is at \\(y = 3\\) (freeway 3). Freeway 3 has a car with span \\([25, 60]\\) at \\(t = 7\\), which does not include 0. Thus, no collision occurs.\n- After action \\(a_7 = U\\), at turn \\(t = 8\\), the player is at \\(y = 4\\) (freeway 4). Freeway 4 has a car with span \\([1, 12]\\) at \\(t = 8\\), which does not include 0 (as the span moves to \\([13, 24]\\) at \\(t = 8\\) due to speed 12). Thus, no collision.\n- At turn \\(t = 9\\), \\(y = 5\\) (freeway 5). Freeway 5 has a car with span \\([1, 12]\\) at \\(t = 9\\), moving to \\([25, 36]\\), not including 0. Safe.\n- At turn \\(t = 10\\), \\(y = 6\\) (freeway 6). Freeway 6 has a car with span \\([1, 12]\\) at \\(t = 10\\), moving to \\([37, 48]\\), not including 0. Safe.\n- At turn \\(t = 11\\), \\(y = 7\\) (freeway 7). Freeway 7 has a car with span \\([25, 60]\\) at \\(t = 11\\), moving to \\([133, 168]\\) (speed 36), not including 0. Safe.\n- At turn \\(t = 12\\), \\(y = 8\\) (freeway 8). Freeway 8 has three cars:\n  - Car 1: span \\([-47, -36]\\) at \\(t = 7\\), moving to \\([-27, -16]\\) at \\(t = 12\\) (speed 4), not including 0.\n  - Car 2: span \\([29, 40]\\) at \\(t = 7\\), moving to \\([49, 60]\\) at \\(t = 12\\), not including 0.\n  - Car 3: span \\([-7, 4]\\) at \\(t = 7\\), moving to \\([13, 24]\\) at \\(t = 12\\), not including 0.\n  Thus, no collision at \\(t = 12\\).\n\nAfter the sixth action at turn \\(t_1 + 5 = 12\\), the player reaches \\(y_{13} = 9\\), which is not a freeway, so no collision check is needed.\n\nThis path avoids all danger times:\n- Freeway 2 is dangerous only at \\(t = 8\\), but the player is at \\(y = 4\\) (not freeway 2).\n- Freeway 8 is dangerous at \\(t = 7\\) and \\(t = 8\\), but the player is at \\(y = 3\\) and \\(y = 4\\) respectively (not freeway 8).\n- Freeway 1 is dangerous at \\(t = 16, 17, 18\\), but these are later and not relevant.\n\nSince the player moves directly upward through safe freeways at all relevant times, and \\(H = 6\\) is the minimum possible (as \\(9 - 3 = 6\\) moves required), this sequence is optimal.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } t_1: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 1: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 2: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 3: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 4: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 5: U \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to get the player from (0,4) at turn t1 = 8 to (0,9) in the minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The player moves up, down, or stays with actions U, D, S, changing y by +1, -1, or 0 respectively, and y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars are on each freeway from 1 to 8, and they move left or right with given speeds. Collision happens only if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there's a car such that 0 is in its span at that exact turn. Importantly, if I move to a new row at turn T, I'm not on that new row until the next turn, so I only care about the car on the row I'm currently on at each turn.\n\nThe car positions are given at turn t1=8, and I need to compute where they are at future turns based on their speed and direction.\n\nLet me list out the car states for each freeway at t1=8:\n\n- Freeway 1: two cars\n  - Car 1: head -32, tail -43, direction right, speed 4. Since it's right-moving, head is larger? The notation says for right-moving: span at t1 is [τ, h] with τ tail, h head? Let's read carefully.\n\nThe car update rules:\n\nFor left-moving: span(t1) = [h, τ] → span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nFor right-moving: span(t1) = [τ, h] → span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nIn the table, for freeway 1, it says: (-32, -43, right, 4) and (32, 21, right, 4)\n\nFor the first car: (-32, -43, right, 4). Since it's right-moving, the span at t1 is [τ, h] = [-43, -32]? But it says head and tail, but in the notation, for right-moving, it's given as (head, tail) or (tail, head)?\n\nLook: \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nBut in the update, for right-moving, it uses [τ, h] for the span. There's inconsistency in the notation.\n\nRead carefully:\n\n\"Car State: | Freeway k | Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s) |\"\n\nThen for car update:\n\nLeft-moving: span(t1) = [h, τ] meaning from h to τ, so if h is head and τ is tail, for left-moving, head is left or right? This is confusing.\n\nAssume that for all cars, \"head\" is the front of the car in its direction of motion.\n\nSo for left-moving car, head is to the left, tail to the right? Since it's moving left.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving, head is to the right, tail to the left.\n\nBut in the span notation, for collision, we care about the x-position covering 0.\n\nFor a left-moving car: at t1, span is [h, τ] with h head, τ tail, and since moving left, head is smaller x, tail larger x? Let's think coordinates.\n\nAssume x-axis, with 0 being the player's x-position.\n\nFor left-moving car: moving left, so head is at smaller x, tail at larger x. So span [h, τ] with h < τ, and as it moves left, both decrease.\n\nIn the update: span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)], so h and τ are positions at t1.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving: span(t1) = [τ, h] but in the car state, it's given as (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s).\n\nFor right-moving, head h is larger x, tail τ is smaller x, so span should be [τ, h] with τ < h.\n\nIn the car list, for freeway 1: (-32, -43, right, 4)\n\nHere, head is -32, tail is -43. Since right-moving, head should be larger, but -32 > -43, yes, -32 is larger than -43, so head at -32, tail at -43, so span is from τ=-43 to h=-32, so [ -43, -32 ]? But according to update, for right-moving, span(t1) = [τ, h] = [-43, -32], which is correct, since τ=-43, h=-32.\n\nSimilarly, the second car on freeway 1: (32, 21, right, 4). Head 32, tail 21? But for right-moving, head should be larger, 32 > 21, yes, so span [τ, h] = [21, 32].\n\nNow, for left-moving, like freeway 2: (0, 23, left, 24)\n\nDirection left, so head should be smaller, but here head=0, tail=23, 0 < 23, so head at 0, tail at 23, span [h, τ] = [0, 23].\n\nOkay, consistent.\n\nNow, collision occurs at turn T only if player is on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there is a car such that 0 is in its span at turn T.\n\nPlayer position y_t is for turn t, so at turn T, player is at y_T, and we check cars on freeway y_T at turn T.\n\nAlso, note that if player moves at turn T to a new y, at turn T they are still on the old y, and only move to new y at turn T+1.\n\nThe update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, so action at t affects position at t+1.\n\nAt turn t, player is at y_t.\n\nAction a_t is applied, so y_{t+1} is set based on a_t.\n\nThen at turn t+1, player is at y_{t+1}.\n\nFor collision at turn T: player is at y_T, and we check cars on freeway y_T at turn T, i.e., if 0 in span of some car on row y_T at turn T.\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need to know when a car has 0 in its span.\n\nSince the cars move at constant speed, I can find for each car the times when 0 is covered.\n\nBut multiple cars per freeway, so for each freeway, I need the set of times when 0 is covered by any car on that row.\n\nThen, for the player, when moving through the rows, at each turn, for the row they are on, it must not be a collision time for that row.\n\nPlayer starts at turn t1=8, y=4.\n\nGoal: reach y=9 in min turns.\n\ny=9 is the top, no cars, since cars on y=1 to 8.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nBut we need to reach (0,9), so at some turn, y_t =9.\n\nNow, actions: U, D, S.\n\nTo minimize H, probably want to go up as fast as possible, but need to avoid the rows when cars are covering 0.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway the times when 0 is covered.\n\nDefine T relative to t1=8. Set τ = T - t1, so at τ=0, it's turn 8.\n\nFor each car, at time τ after t1, the span changes.\n\nFor a car, the span at time τ: since T = t1 + τ, so T - t1 = τ.\n\nFor left-moving car: span(τ) = [h - s τ, τ - s τ] wait no.\n\nFrom earlier: span(T) = [h - s (T-t1), τ - s (T-t1)] but τ is tail, confusing notation.\n\nUse t for time since t1.\n\nSet t = T - t1, so t=0 at current turn.\n\nFor a left-moving car: span at time t: [h - s t, tail - s t]\n\nSince at t=0, [h, tail]\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving: span at time t: [tail + s t, head + s t] because span(T) = [τ + s (T-t1), h + s (T-t1)] = [tail + s t, head + s t]\n\n0 is covered if min_span <= 0 <= max_span.\n\nFor left-moving: min = min(h - s t, tail - s t), but since h <= tail for left-moving? In our case, for left-moving, h < tail, so min is h - s t, max is tail - s t.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving, tail < head, so min is tail + s t, max is head + s t.\n\n0 covered if min <= 0 <= max.\n\nSince min and max change with t.\n\nFor each car, find t where 0 is in [min, max].\n\nt is integer, since turns are discrete.\n\nNow, for each freeway, list the cars and find for which t the freeway is occupied at x=0.\n\nStart with freeway 1: y=1\n\nCars:\n\n1. Right-moving: head h=-32, tail τ=-43, speed s=4\n\nSpan at t: [τ + s t, h + s t] = [-43 + 4t, -32 + 4t]\n\n0 in span if -43 + 4t <= 0 <= -32 + 4t\n\nSolve inequalities:\n\n-43 + 4t <= 0 => 4t <= 43 => t <= 43/4 = 10.75, so t <= 10 since integer? t <= floor(10.75) but inequality.\n\n-43 + 4t <= 0 and 0 <= -32 + 4t\n\nFirst: -43 + 4t <= 0 => 4t <= 43 => t <= 10.75, so for t <= 10\n\nt <= 10 since t integer, t <= 10\n\n4t <= 43, t <= 10.75, so t <= 10 because 4*10=40<=43, 4*11=44>43, but -43 +4t <=0 when 4t <=43, so for t=0 to t=10: -43+40=-3<=0, -43+44=1>0? Let's compute:\n\nt=10: -43 + 40 = -3 <=0\n\nt=11: -43 + 44 =1 >0, so -43+4t <=0 for t<=10\n\nNow second inequality: 0 <= -32 + 4t => 4t >=32 => t>=8\n\nSo for t from 8 to 10 inclusive.\n\nt=8: 0 <= -32 + 32 =0, yes\n\nt=9: 0 <= -32 + 36 =4, yes\n\nt=10: 0 <= -32 + 40 =8, yes\n\nt=7: 0 <= -32 + 28 = -4? 0 <= -4? False, so not.\n\nSo car 1 covers 0 at t=8,9,10\n\nNow second car on freeway 1: (32, 21, right, 4)\n\nHead=32, tail=21, right, s=4\n\nSpan at t: [21 + 4t, 32 + 4t]\n\n0 in span if 21+4t <=0 <=32+4t\n\nBut 21+4t <=0? 21+4t >=21>0 for t>=0, so left part 21+4t <=0 is false for all t, since min is at least 21. So never covers 0. 21+4t >=21 >0, so 0 not in [21+4t, 32+4t] since lower bound >0.\n\nSo only car 1 matters for freeway 1.\n\nThus freeway 1 occupied at t=8,9,10 relative to t1.\n\nt=8,9,10, but t=0 is turn t1=8, so at absolute turn: turn 8 (t=0), turn 9 (t=1), turn 10 (t=2)? Let's clarify.\n\nt = T - t1, so at T = t1, t=0\n\nT = t1 +1, t=1, etc.\n\nAt turn T, t = T - t1.\n\nFor freeway 1, occupied when t=8,9,10? t is offset.\n\nt=0: T=t1=8\n\nt=1: T=9\n\nt=2: T=10\n\netc.\n\nFrom above, for car, t=8,9,10: but t is offset from t1.\n\nIn the inequality, t is the time since t1, so at t=8, which is T = t1 +8 =8+8=16? No.\n\nI think I confused the variable.\n\nSet t_offset = T - t1, so t_offset = 0,1,2,...\n\nFor freeway 1, car 1 covers 0 at t_offset = 8,9,10? From above:\n\nt_offset from t1.\n\nFrom inequality: t >=8 and t<=10, so t_offset =8,9,10\n\nBut at t_offset=0, which is T=8, is it covered?\n\nAt t_offset=0: span [-43, -32], 0 not in, since -32<0? -32 to -43, -43< -32<0, so min=-43, max=-32, both negative, 0 not in, so not covered at t_offset=0.\n\nt_offset=8: span [-43 +4*8, -32 +4*8] = [-43+32, -32+32] = [-11, 0], so 0 in [-11,0], yes.\n\nt_offset=9: [-43+36, -32+36] = [-7,4], 0 in.\n\nt_offset=10: [-43+40, -32+40] = [-3,8], 0 in.\n\nt_offset=11: [-43+44, -32+44] = [1,12], 0 not <=1? 0 <1, not in since min=1>0.\n\nSo covered at t_offset=8,9,10.\n\nt_offset=8 is T= t1 +8 =8+8=16\n\nt_offset=9: T=17\n\nt_offset=10: T=18\n\nBut we are at t1=8 now, so in the near future, t_offset small, freeway 1 is not occupied yet.\n\nt_offset=8 is 8 turns later, so for now, freeway 1 is safe for small t.\n\nNow, freeway 2: y=2\n\nCar: (0, 23, left, 24)\n\nDirection left, so head h=0, tail τ=23, s=24\n\nSpan at t_offset: [h - s t, τ - s t] = [0 - 24t, 23 - 24t]\n\n0 in span if min <=0<= max, min=0-24t, max=23-24t\n\nSince left-moving, and h=0 < τ=23, so min = h - s t =0 -24t, max = τ - s t =23-24t\n\n0 in [min, max] if min <=0 and 0 <= max\n\nmin <=0: 0-24t <=0 => -24t <=0 => t >=0, always true for t>=0\n\n0 <= max: 0 <= 23 -24t => 24t <=23 => t <= 23/24 = 0.958, so t <= 0 since t integer? t=0: 0 <=23, true; t=1: 0 <=23-24= -1? false. So only at t_offset=0.\n\nAt t_offset=0, span [0,23], 0 is included, since min=0.\n\nSo freeway 2 occupied at t_offset=0, which is turn T= t1=8.\n\nSo at current turn, freeway 2 has a car covering 0.\n\nPlayer is at y=4 at turn 8, so not on y=2, so for now no collision, but if player is on y=2 at turn 8, it would collide, but player is at y=4.\n\nNow, for future, freeway 2 occupied only at t_offset=0, so for t_offset >=1, not occupied.\n\nt_offset=0 only.\n\nNow freeway 3: y=3\n\nCar: (-48, -83, right, 36)\n\nRight-moving, head=-48? Head and tail.\n\nHead h=-48, tail τ=-83, right, s=36\n\nSince right-moving, head should be larger, but -48 > -83? -48 is larger than -83, yes.\n\nSpan at t: [τ + s t, h + s t] = [-83 + 36t, -48 + 36t]\n\n0 in span if -83 +36t <=0 <= -48 +36t\n\nFirst: -83 +36t <=0 => 36t <=83 => t <= 83/36 ≈ 2.305, so t <=2\n\nSecond: 0 <= -48 +36t => 36t >=48 => t >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈1.333, so t>=2 since t integer? t>= ceil(1.333)=2\n\nt>=2 and t<=2, so t=2 only.\n\nt=2: check: -83+72= -11 <=0, 0 <= -48+72=24, yes.\n\nt=1: -83+36= -47 <=0, but 0 <= -48+36= -12? 0 <= -12 false.\n\nt=3: -83+108=25 >0? min= -83+108=25>0, so 0 not <=25, not in.\n\nSo only t_offset=2, T= t1+2=10.\n\nFreeway 4: y=4\n\nCar: (24, 13, right, 12)\n\nRight-moving, head=24, tail=13, s=12\n\nSpan: [13 +12t, 24 +12t]\n\n0 in? 13+12t <=0? min=13+12t >=13>0, so never <=0, so 0 not in span for any t.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 5: same as freeway 4? (24,13,right,12) identical, so same, never covers 0.\n\nFreeway 6: same, (24,13,right,12), never.\n\nFreeway 7: (-48,-83,right,36) same as freeway 3, so only at t_offset=2, T=10.\n\nFreeway 8: multiple cars.\n\nCars: (-32,-43,right,4), (44,33,right,4), (8,-3,right,4)\n\nFirst car: similar to freeway 1 car 1? Freeway 1 had (-32,-43,right,4), which we had.\n\nHere: (-32,-43,right,4), same as before.\n\nSpan: [-43 +4t, -32 +4t]\n\n0 in when t=8,9,10 as before.\n\nBut for freeway 8.\n\nSecond car: (44,33,right,4) head=44, tail=33, s=4\n\nSpan: [33+4t, 44+4t], min=33+4t>=33>0, never covers 0.\n\nThird car: (8,-3,right,4) head=8, tail=-3, s=4\n\nRight-moving, tail=-3, head=8, so span [τ + s t, h + s t] = [-3 +4t, 8 +4t]\n\n0 in span if -3+4t <=0 <= 8+4t\n\nFirst: -3+4t <=0 => 4t <=3 => t <= 0.75, so t<=0\n\nSecond: 0 <=8+4t, always true for t>=0\n\nSo for t<=0, since t integer, t=0\n\nAt t_offset=0, span [-3,8], 0 in [-3,8], yes.\n\nt=1: min= -3+4=1>0, not <=0.\n\nSo only at t_offset=0.\n\nNow for freeway 8, we have:\n\n- First car covers at t=8,9,10\n\n- Second car never\n\n- Third car covers at t=0\n\nSo overall, freeway 8 occupied at t_offset=0 (from third car) and t_offset=8,9,10 (from first car)\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway the dangerous times (t_offset when occupied at x=0)\n\ny=1: occupied at t=8,9,10\n\ny=2: occupied at t=0 only\n\ny=3: occupied at t=2 only\n\ny=4: never occupied\n\ny=5: never occupied\n\ny=6: never occupied\n\ny=7: occupied at t=2 only (same as y=3)\n\ny=8: occupied at t=0, and t=8,9,10\n\nt_offset=0 is now, turn 8.\n\nPlayer starts at turn 8, y=4.\n\ny=4 is never occupied, so at turn 8, on y=4, safe.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\ny=9 has no cars, always safe.\n\nBut to reach y=9, we need to pass through y=5,6,7,8 or go directly.\n\ny=4,5,6,7,8,9.\n\ny=5 and y=6 are always safe, since no cars cover 0 ever.\n\ny=7 occupied only at t=2, which is turn t1+2=10.\n\ny=8 occupied at t=0 (turn 8) and t=8,9,10 (turns 16,17,18)\n\nt=0 is now, but player is at y=4, not y=8.\n\nWe are at turn 8, t_offset=0.\n\nNow, to reach y=9 in min turns.\n\nSince we start at y=4, and need to go to y=9, difference of 5, so min H=5 if we go up each turn, but need to avoid collisions on the rows.\n\nPlayer can only change y by at most 1 per turn, so from y=4 to y=9, need at least 5 turns: to y=5,6,7,8,9.\n\nBut we might need to wait or go down if necessary, but since we want min turns, probably avoid waiting if possible.\n\nNow, the dangerous rows: y=2,3,7,8 have some dangerous times, but y=2 and y=3 are below, we are at y=4, going up, so we might not go there.\n\nSimilarly, y=1 is dangerous later, but far.\n\nNow, rows above: y=5 and y=6 always safe.\n\ny=7 dangerous only at t_offset=2, turn 10.\n\ny=8 dangerous at t_offset=0 (turn 8), and later at 16,17,18.\n\nBut t_offset=0 is now, turn 8, we are not on y=8.\n\nWe need to be on y=8 at some point before going to y=9.\n\nThe sequence: at turn T, y_T.\n\nStart at T=8, y=4.\n\nThen action a_8, which determines y_9.\n\nThen a_9 determines y_10, and so on.\n\nWe need to choose actions so that when on a row with cars, it is not a dangerous time for that row.\n\nFor y=7, dangerous only at t_offset=2, which is T=10.\n\nFor y=8, dangerous at T=8 (t_offset=0) and T=16,17,18.\n\nBut T=8 is past, we are at T=8, y=4, not on y=8.\n\nNow, min steps: from y=4 to y=9, need to increase y by 5, so min 5 actions: at T=8,9,10,11,12 to reach y=9 at T=13? Let's see.\n\nAt T=8: y=4\n\nAfter a_8, y_9 = y_8 + Δy\n\nIf a_8=U, y_9=5\n\nThen if a_9=U, y_10=6\n\na_10=U, y_11=7\n\na_11=U, y_12=8\n\na_12=U, y_13=9\n\nSo at T=13, y=9.\n\nH=5 turns? From t=8 to t=13, that's 5 steps: t=8,9,10,11,12 actions, y from 4 to 5,6,7,8,9 at t=9,10,11,12,13.\n\nAt turn T, y_T is position.\n\nSo at T=8: y=4\n\nT=9: y=5 (if a_8=U)\n\nT=10: y=6 (if a_9=U)\n\nT=11: y=7 (if a_10=U)\n\nT=12: y=8 (if a_11=U)\n\nT=13: y=9 (if a_12=U)\n\nNow, check collisions:\n\nAt T=8: y=4, which is safe, no car.\n\nT=9: y=5, freeway 5, always safe.\n\nT=10: y=6, freeway 6, always safe.\n\nT=11: y=7, freeway 7. Now, y=7 dangerous at T=10? t_offset for T=11.\n\nT=11, t_offset = T - t1 = 11-8=3\n\ny=7 dangerous at t_offset=2, which is T=10.\n\nAt T=11, t_offset=3, not dangerous, since only t_offset=2.\n\nSimilarly, y=8 dangerous at T=8,16,17,18, not at T=11,12,etc.\n\nT=12: y=8, t_offset=12-8=4, not dangerous.\n\nT=13: y=9, safe.\n\nSo this path: all safe, and reaches in 5 turns.\n\nBut at T=10, y=6, safe.\n\nIs there a problem?\n\nT=11, y=7, freeway 7 occupied only at t_offset=2, T=10, so at T=11, not occupied.\n\nSimilarly, T=12, y=8, not occupied at that time.\n\ny=8 occupied at T=8 and T=16,17,18, not at T=12.\n\nSo seems fine.\n\nBut let's confirm the actions.\n\nStart T=8, y=4.\n\na_8: U, then y_9=5\n\nT=9, y=5, action a_9: U, y_10=6\n\nT=10, y=6, action a_10: U, y_11=7\n\nT=11, y=7, action a_11: U, y_12=8\n\nT=12, y=8, action a_12: U, y_13=9\n\nAt T=13, y=9, done.\n\nH=5 turns, actions from t=8 to t=12.\n\nt=8,9,10,11,12.\n\nNow, but y=2 is dangerous at T=8, but we are not on it.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nBut in the sequence above, we never go to dangerous rows at dangerous times.\n\nBut is there a reason to go slower? Probably not, since min is 5.\n\nBut let's see if we can go faster? No, because we have to move step by step, so from 4 to 9, min 5 moves up.\n\nWe could go down, but that would take more turns, so not minimal.\n\nSo this should be fine.\n\nBut in the actions, at each turn, we choose U.\n\nBut let's list the turns.\n\nCurrent turn is t1=8.\n\nWe need to output actions starting from a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H -1}, and after H turns, at turn t1 + H, position should be (0,9).\n\nIn the sequence, after H actions, we reach.\n\nDefine: after k actions, we are at turn t1 + k.\n\nAt turn t1, position given.\n\nAfter action a_{t1}, at turn t1+1, y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + Δy\n\n...\n\nAfter action a_{t1 + H-1}, at turn t1 + H, y_{t1 + H} =9.\n\nIn this case, start turn 8, y=4.\n\nAfter 5 actions: a_8 to a_12, at turn 13, y=9.\n\nH=5.\n\nActions: a_8, a_9, a_10, a_11, a_12 all U.\n\nNow, but we need to confirm if at any point collision.\n\nAt turn 8: y=4, freeway 4, no car at 0, safe.\n\nTurn 9: y=5, freeway 5, always safe.\n\nTurn 10: y=6, freeway 6, always safe.\n\nTurn 11: y=7, freeway 7. Dangerous at T=10, but T=11 is not T=10, so safe.\n\nTurn 12: y=8, freeway 8. Dangerous at T=8 and T=16,17,18. T=12 not among, so safe.\n\nTurn 13: y=9, safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nBut is there a problem with y=7 at other times? No, only T=10 dangerous.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut in freeway 8, at T=8, it was dangerous, but we not on it.\n\nNow, but the player might be on y=8 at other times, but in this path, only at T=12, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nBut let's see if we can reach faster? From y=4 to y=9, min 5 steps, since each step max +1, so no.\n\nIf we start by staying, but that would take more turns.\n\nSo min H=5.\n\nBut in the car states, for example, freeway 2 is dangerous at T=8, but we are at y=4.\n\nAnother thing: at turn T, when we are on a row, we need to ensure no car covers 0 at that turn.\n\nIn this case, all fine.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's list the dangerous turns for each row:\n\nRow y=1: dangerous at T=16,17,18 (t_offset=8,9,10)\n\ny=2: dangerous at T=8 only\n\ny=3: dangerous at T=10 only (t_offset=2)\n\ny=4: never\n\ny=5: never\n\ny=6: never\n\ny=7: dangerous at T=10 only\n\ny=8: dangerous at T=8 and T=16,17,18\n\nIn our path:\n\nT=8: y=4, safe\n\nT=9: y=5, safe\n\nT=10: y=6, safe (y=6 never dangerous)\n\nT=11: y=7, safe (y=7 dangerous only T=10)\n\nT=12: y=8, safe (y=8 dangerous T=8 and later, not T=12)\n\nT=13: y=9, safe\n\nPerfect.\n\nNow, actions:\n\nTurn t1: a_{t1} = a_8 = U\n\nThen turn t1+1: a_9 = U\n\n...\n\nUp to a_{t1 + H-1} = a_{12}\n\nH=5, so actions from t=8 to t=12, that's 5 actions.\n\nt=8,9,10,11,12.\n\nOutput:\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nIn the answer format, it should be from turn t1 to t1 + H-1.\n\nNow, but the question is to output the sequence.\n\nBut in the car list, for freeway 4,5,6, no cars, so always safe.\n\ny=7 and y=8 have dangerous times, but we avoid them.\n\nIn this case, at T=10, we are at y=6, which is safe, while y=7 is dangerous at T=10, but we are not on it.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nIs there a shorter path? Suppose we go up faster, but we can't, since only +1 per turn.\n\nUnless we start from higher, but we start from 4.\n\nPerhaps we can go down to avoid, but that would increase turns.\n\nFor example, if we went to y=7 at T=10, it would be dangerous, but in our path, we are at y=7 at T=11, safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo min H=5.\n\nBut in the output, we need to specify the actions.\n\nNow, the answer should be in boxed.\n\nBut let's write it.\n\nSo sequence:\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nAnd after that, at turn 13, y=9.\n\nBut the action at turn 12 is U to go to y=9.\n\nIn the sequence, the last action is at turn 12, which sets y_13=9.\n\nYes.\n\nH=5 turns of actions.\n\nNow, but in the problem, it says \"reach (0,9)\", and \"after H turns\".\n\nAlso, in the note, it says if you move to new y at turn T, you are not on it until turn T+1.\n\nBut in our case, no issue.\n\nAnother thing: for freeway 8, at T=8, it is occupied, but we are not on it.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nPerhaps we can go directly without issue.\n\nBut just to see, if we had to be on y=7 at T=10, it would be bad, but we avoid.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo minimal H=5.\n\nNow, output format.\n\nIt should be:\n\n\\boxed{  \nTurn 8: U  \nTurn 9: U  \nTurn 10: U  \nTurn 11: U  \nTurn 12: U  \n}\n\nBut turn numbers: since t1=8, so Turn t_1: U, Turn t_1 +1: U, etc.\n\nIn the format: Turn t_1: a_{t_1}, Turn t_1 +1: a_{t_1 +1}, ..., up to Turn t_1 + H-1: a_{t_1 + H-1}\n\nHere H=5, so from t_1 to t_1 +4? Let's see.\n\nt_1 =8\n\nAction at t_1: a_8\n\nAction at t_1 +1: a_9\n\n...\n\nAction at t_1 + (H-1): a_{t_1 + H-1}\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t_1 + H, y=9.\n\nHere t_1 + H =13, y=9.\n\nSo actions at turns 8,9,10,11,12.\n\nThat is t_1, t_1+1, t_1+2, t_1+3, t_1+4.\n\nSince H=5, turns from t_1 to t_1 +4.\n\nt_1 + (H-1) = t_1 +4 =12.\n\nYes.\n\nSo output:\n\nTurn 8: U  \nTurn 9: U  \nTurn 10: U  \nTurn 11: U  \nTurn 12: U\n\nNow, in the box.\n\nBut I think that's it.\n\nBut just to be paranoid, is y=7 safe at T=11?\n\ny=7 dangerous only at T=10, so at T=11, no car, since only at t_offset=2.\n\nSimilarly, all fine.\n\nPerhaps we can have a shorter sequence if we go down and up, but that would take more turns, not minimal.\n\nFor example, if we go to y=3 or something, but no need.\n\nSo this should be the minimal.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 4) at turn 8 and needs to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y = 1 to y = 8.\n\n### Analysis of Car Occupancy at x=0\nThe times when each freeway is occupied at x=0 (i.e., a collision would occur if the player is on that freeway) are determined based on the car states at turn 8 and their movement rules. The offset \\( t \\) is defined as \\( t = T - 8 \\), where \\( T \\) is the absolute turn number.\n\n- **Freeway 1 (y=1)**: Occupied at \\( t = 8, 9, 10 \\) (turns 16, 17, 18).\n- **Freeway 2 (y=2)**: Occupied at \\( t = 0 \\) (turn 8).\n- **Freeway 3 (y=3)**: Occupied at \\( t = 2 \\) (turn 10).\n- **Freeway 4 (y=4)**: Never occupied.\n- **Freeway 5 (y=5)**: Never occupied.\n- **Freeway 6 (y=6)**: Never occupied.\n- **Freeway 7 (y=7)**: Occupied at \\( t = 2 \\) (turn 10).\n- **Freeway 8 (y=8)**: Occupied at \\( t = 0 \\) (turn 8) and \\( t = 8, 9, 10 \\) (turns 16, 17, 18).\n\n### Path to Reach (0, 9) in Minimal Turns\nThe player must move from y=4 to y=9, requiring a minimum of 5 upward moves (each increasing y by 1). The sequence of positions and turns is as follows:\n\n- At turn 8: Player is at y=4 (safe, as y=4 is never occupied).\n- Action at turn 8: Move up (U) → at turn 9, y=5 (safe, as y=5 is never occupied).\n- Action at turn 9: Move up (U) → at turn 10, y=6 (safe, as y=6 is never occupied).\n- Action at turn 10: Move up (U) → at turn 11, y=7 (safe, as y=7 is occupied only at turn 10, not turn 11).\n- Action at turn 11: Move up (U) → at turn 12, y=8 (safe, as y=8 is occupied at turns 8 and 16-18, not turn 12).\n- Action at turn 12: Move up (U) → at turn 13, y=9 (safe, as y=9 has no cars).\n\nThis sequence takes 5 turns (from turn 8 to turn 12) to reach y=9 at turn 13. No collisions occur, as the player avoids all dangerous freeways at dangerous times. Moving directly upward without delays minimizes \\( H \\), and going down or waiting would increase the number of turns unnecessarily.\n\n### Output\nThe minimal number of turns \\( H = 5 \\), with the sequence of actions starting from turn 8:\n\n\\boxed{  \nTurn 8: U \\\\  \nTurn 9: U \\\\  \nTurn 10: U \\\\  \nTurn 11: U \\\\  \nTurn 12: U  \n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at position (0, 5) at turn t_1 = 9. I need to get to (0, 9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. The vertical axis goes from y=0 to y=9, and we're starting at y=5.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing y by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9 inclusive.\n\nCars are on freeways y=1 to y=8, each with their positions and movements. Cars move left or right with a certain speed, and their positions are given as spans: head and tail. For left-moving cars, the span is [h, τ] and it moves left, so h decreases. For right-moving, it's [τ, h] and both increase. I need to avoid being on a freeway when a car's span includes 0 at that turn.\n\nThe key point is that collision happens only if at turn T, the player is on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there is a car where 0 is in its span at that exact turn T. Also, when moving to a new freeway, you're not considered on it until the next turn. So if you move to y_{T+1} at turn T, you're on y_T at turn T, and only check cars on y_T for collision at T.\n\nThe goal is to reach y=9, which is the top, and since it's position (0,9), and no cars on y=9 or y=0, I assume, since freeways are y=1 to 8. y=0 and y=9 should be safe, but I need to be on y=9 at some turn.\n\nThe player position is given as (0, y_t), so x is always 0, I think, since it's a vertical movement, and cars are on horizontal freeways, so collision is when x=0 is in the car's span at y_t at turn t.\n\nNow, I need the sequence of actions from turn t_1=9 onwards.\n\nFirst, list all cars at turn t_1=9.\n\nFor each freeway k from 1 to 8:\n\n- Freeway 1: two cars: \n  - First: head -28, tail -39, direction right, speed 4. Since direction is right, the span is [τ, h] = [-39, -28]? No.\n\nThe table says: for freeway 1: (-28, -39, right, 4)\n\nIt says: Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\n\nAnd for left-moving, span is [h, τ], for right-moving, [τ, h].\n\nIn the car update, for left-moving: span(t1) = [h, τ] → [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nFor right-moving: span(t1) = [τ, h] → [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nIn the state, it's given as (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\n\nFor a right-moving car, head should be the front when moving right, so if direction right, head is larger, tail smaller, and span is [tail, head] since it moves right, so tail increases, head increases.\n\nSimilarly for left, head is smaller, tail larger? Let's clarify.\n\nIn the left-moving case, it says span(t1) = [h, τ] with h and τ, and moves left, so h decreases, τ decreases.\n\nIn the state given, for freeway 1, first car: (-28, -39, right, 4)\n\nSince direction right, and head is -28, tail is -39? That seems odd because -28 > -39, so if head is -28 and tail is -39, and direction right, that means the car is moving right, so head at -28, tail at -39? But tail should be behind, so if moving right, tail is left, head is right, so if x increases right, tail should have smaller x, head larger x.\n\nHere, tail τ = -39, head h = -28, and -39 < -28, so tail at -39, head at -28, so the car spans from -39 to -28, and since moving right, the span is [τ, h] = [-39, -28].\n\nThen at time T, it becomes [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] = [-39 + 4(T-9), -28 + 4(T-9)]\n\nSimilarly, second car on freeway 1: (36, 25, right, 4)\n\nHead 36, tail 25? 25 < 36, so tail at 25, head at 36, moving right, so span [25, 36] at t1=9.\n\nThen at T, [25 + 4(T-9), 36 + 4(T-9)]\n\nNow freeway 2: (-24, -1, left, 24)\n\nDirection left, so for left-moving, span is [h, τ] with h and τ.\n\nHere head h = -24, tail τ = -1? -24 < -1, so head at -24, tail at -1? If moving left, head is left, tail is right? Let's see the update rule.\n\nFor left-moving: span(t1) = [h, τ] → [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nIn this case, h = -24, τ = -1, and since moving left, head should be the front when moving left, so if moving left, head has smaller x, tail has larger x.\n\nHere h = -24, τ = -1, -24 < -1, so head at -24, tail at -1, span [h, τ] = [-24, -1]? But [h, τ] with h=-24, τ=-1, so from -24 to -1, and moving left, so both decrease.\n\nAt T, [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)] = [-24 -24(T-9), -1 -24(T-9)]\n\nBut τ = -1, which is tail, and for left-moving, it's [h, τ] with h and τ, but in the span, it might be inclusive or what, but we care about whether 0 is in the interval.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: (-12, -47, right, 36)\n\nDirection right, head -12, tail -47? -47 < -12, so tail at -47, head at -12, span [τ, h] = [-47, -12] at t1.\n\nThen at T, [-47 + 36(T-9), -12 + 36(T-9)]\n\nFreeway 4: (36, 25, right, 12)  head 36, tail 25, so [25, 36] at t1, at T [25 +12(T-9), 36 +12(T-9)]\n\nFreeway 5: same as freeway 4: (36, 25, right, 12) so identical to freeway 4.\n\nFreeway 6: (36, 25, right, 12) same as 4 and 5.\n\nFreeway 7: (-12, -47, right, 36) same as freeway 3.\n\nFreeway 8: three cars: (-28, -39, right, 4), (48, 37, right, 4), (12, 1, right, 4)\n\nFirst car: head -28, tail -39, right, so span [-39, -28] at t1\n\nSecond: head 48, tail 37, right, span [37, 48] at t1\n\nThird: head 12, tail 1, right, span [1, 12] at t1\n\nAll with speed 4.\n\nNow, the player starts at y=5 at turn 9.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\nSince y=9 has no cars, it's safe, but I need to pass through freeways 6,7,8 to get there from y=5.\n\ny=5 is a freeway? Freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=5 has cars, since freeway 5 has cars.\n\nFreeway k corresponds to y=k, I think.\n\nThe freeway is at y=k, and player is at (0,y_t), so when on y_t, check cars on that row.\n\nAt turn t, player is on freeway y_t, and must not have 0 in any car's span on that freeway at that turn.\n\nAlso, when moving, if you move at turn T to y_{T+1}, you are on y_T at turn T, so you only check cars on y_T for collision at T.\n\nTo reach y=9, which is above, so I probably want to move up as much as possible.\n\nBut I need to avoid the cars.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway and each turn, whether it is safe to be there, i.e., no car has 0 in its span.\n\nSince the cars move, the safety depends on the turn.\n\nLet t be the turn number, with t1=9 as the starting turn.\n\nSo for a given turn T, and freeway k, is there any car on k where 0 is in its span at turn T.\n\nSpan at T depends on T - t1 = T - 9.\n\nSet Δt = T - 9, so at turn T = 9 + Δt.\n\nFor each car, the span at T is:\n\nFirst, for freeway 1:\n\nCar 1: right, s=4, span at t1: [τ, h] = [-39, -28]\n\nAt T: [-39 + 4Δt, -28 + 4Δt]\n\nCar 2: right, s=4, [25,36] at t1, at T: [25 + 4Δt, 36 + 4Δt]\n\n0 in span if -39 + 4Δt ≤ 0 ≤ -28 + 4Δt or 25 + 4Δt ≤ 0 ≤ 36 + 4Δt\n\nBut 0 is a point, so for first: -39 + 4Δt ≤ 0 ≤ -28 + 4Δt\n\nWhich is 4Δt ≤ 39 and 4Δt ≥ 28, so 28 ≤ 4Δt ≤ 39, so 7 ≤ Δt ≤ 9.75, since Δt integer? Turns are discrete, so Δt integer.\n\nSimilarly, second: 25 + 4Δt ≤ 0 ≤ 36 + 4Δt\n\n25 + 4Δt ≤ 0 implies 4Δt ≤ -25, Δt ≤ -6.25, but Δt ≥0 since T≥9, so never true.\n\n0 ≤ 36 + 4Δt always true since 4Δt ≥0, but the inequality is both: 25 + 4Δt ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ 36 + 4Δt, but 25+4Δt ≤0 requires Δt ≤ -6.25, impossible, so no, 0 not in span for car 2 at any T≥9.\n\nSimilarly, car 1: 0 in span when 7 ≤ Δt ≤ 9.75, so for Δt=7,8,9\n\nΔt=7: -39 +28 = -11, -28+28=0? Δt=7: -39 +4*7 = -39+28= -11, -28+28=0, so [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nΔt=8: -39+32= -7, -28+32=4, [-7,4], 0 in.\n\nΔt=9: -39+36= -3, -28+36=8, [-3,8], 0 in.\n\nΔt=10: -39+40=1, -28+40=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo freeway 1 unsafe at Δt=7,8,9 i.e. T=16,17,18? T=9+Δt, so for Δt=7, T=16; Δt=8,T=17; Δt=9,T=18.\n\nBut we start from T=9, Δt=0.\n\nAt Δt=0, T=9: car1 span [-39,-28], 0 not in, car2 span [25,36], 0 not in, so freeway 1 safe at T=9.\n\nSimilarly, other times.\n\nBut we care about when it is unsafe.\n\nFor freeway 1, unsafe when Δt=7,8,9 (T=16,17,18)\n\nNow freeway 2: only one car: (-24, -1, left, 24)\n\nDirection left, so span at t1: [h, τ] = [-24, -1] since left-moving.\n\nh=-24, τ=-1, and [h, τ] = [-24, -1]\n\nAt T: [h - s Δt, τ - s Δt] = [-24 -24 Δt, -1 -24 Δt]\n\n0 in span if -24 -24 Δt ≤ 0 ≤ -1 -24 Δt\n\nSince left part decreasing.\n\nSo -24 -24 Δt ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ -1 -24 Δt\n\nFirst inequality: -24 -24 Δt ≤ 0 => -24 Δt ≤ 24 => multiply by -1, reverse inequality, 24 Δt ≥ -24, so Δt ≥ -1, always true for Δt ≥0.\n\nSecond inequality: 0 ≤ -1 -24 Δt => 0 ≤ - (1 + 24 Δt) => 0 ≤ negative number, which is impossible since 1+24Δt >0.\n\nThus, 0 never in span for this car at any T≥9.\n\nSo freeway 2 is always safe? Let me check.\n\nAt Δt=0, span [-24,-1], 0 not in, yes.\n\nAs Δt increases, both ends decrease, so more negative, 0 not in.\n\nSo freeway 2 always safe.\n\nNow freeway 3: (-12, -47, right, 36)\n\nDirection right, head -12, tail -47, so span [τ, h] = [-47, -12] at t1.\n\nAt T: [-47 + 36 Δt, -12 + 36 Δt]\n\n0 in span if -47 +36 Δt ≤ 0 ≤ -12 +36 Δt\n\nWhich is -47 +36 Δt ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ -12 +36 Δt\n\nFirst: 36 Δt ≤ 47 => Δt ≤ 47/36 ≈ 1.305, so Δt ≤1 since integer.\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -12 +36 Δt => 12 ≤ 36 Δt => Δt ≥ 12/36 = 1/3, so Δt ≥1 since integer.\n\nSo both: Δt ≤1 and Δt ≥1, so Δt=1.\n\nAt Δt=1, T=10: span [-47+36, -12+36] = [-11,24], 0 in [-11,24], yes.\n\nFor other Δt, not.\n\nSo freeway 3 unsafe only at T=10.\n\nNow freeway 4: (36,25,right,12) span [25,36] at t1, at T [25+12Δt, 36+12Δt]\n\n0 in span if 25+12Δt ≤0 ≤36+12Δt\n\n25+12Δt ≤0 implies Δt ≤ -25/12 ≈ -2.08, impossible.\n\nSo never, freeway 4 always safe.\n\nSimilarly freeway 5: same as 4, always safe.\n\nFreeway 6: same as 4 and 5, always safe.\n\nFreeway 7: (-12,-47,right,36) same as freeway 3, so unsafe only at T=10.\n\nFreeway 8: three cars.\n\nFirst car: (-28,-39,right,4) span [-39,-28] at t1, at T [-39+4Δt, -28+4Δt]\n\n0 in if -39+4Δt ≤0 ≤ -28+4Δt\n\nSo 4Δt ≤39 and 4Δt ≥28, so 7 ≤ Δt ≤9.75, Δt=7,8,9\n\nT=16,17,18\n\nSecond car: (48,37,right,4) span [37,48] at t1, at T [37+4Δt,48+4Δt]\n\n0 in if 37+4Δt ≤0 ≤48+4Δt, first part 37+4Δt≤0 impossible, so never.\n\nThird car: (12,1,right,4) span [1,12] at t1, at T [1+4Δt,12+4Δt]\n\n0 in if 1+4Δt ≤0 ≤12+4Δt\n\n1+4Δt≤0 implies Δt≤ -0.25, impossible, so never.\n\nSo for freeway 8, only first car affects, unsafe at Δt=7,8,9 T=16,17,18.\n\nNow summarize safety per freeway over time.\n\nFreeway 1: unsafe at T=16,17,18\n\nFreeway 2: always safe\n\nFreeway 3: unsafe at T=10\n\nFreeway 4: always safe\n\nFreeway 5: always safe\n\nFreeway 6: always safe\n\nFreeway 7: unsafe at T=10\n\nFreeway 8: unsafe at T=16,17,18\n\ny=0 and y=9 no cars, always safe.\n\nPlayer starts at y=5 at T=9.\n\ny=5 is freeway 5, which is always safe, so at T=9, on y=5, safe.\n\nNow, I need to go to y=9.\n\nThe minimal number of turns might be 4, since from y=5 to y=9 is 4 steps up, but I have to avoid unsafe times.\n\nFirst, I can only move one step per turn, so minimum H=4 if I go up all the way.\n\nBut I need to check for each step if I would be on an unsafe freeway.\n\nLet me denote the turn sequence.\n\nAt turn T=9, position y=5.\n\nThen action a_{9} determines y_{10}, and so on.\n\nI need y_{t1 + H -1} =9, with t1=9, so at turn T=9 + (H-1), y=9.\n\nSet the turn when we reach y=9 as T_end = 9 + (H-1)\n\nSince we start at T=9, y=5, after H-1 actions, we are at turn 9 + (H-1) with y=9.\n\nThe sequence of actions from t=9 to t=9+H-2, and at t=9+H-1, we are at y=9.\n\nActions: a_t for t from t1 to t1+H-2, and position at t from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t, after action a_t, y_{t+1} = y_t + delta y.\n\nStart: turn 9, y_9 =5\n\nAfter a_9, y_10 = y_9 + delta, and so on, up to after a_{9+H-2}, y_{9+H-1} =9.\n\nAt each turn t, when we are at y_t, it must be safe, i.e., no collision on freeway y_t at turn t.\n\nSince we move to y_{t+1} at turn t, we are on y_t at turn t.\n\nFor example, at turn t=9, we are on y_9=5, which is safe.\n\nThen we choose a_9: U, D, or S.\n\nIf U, y_10 =6\n\nIf D, y_10=4, etc.\n\nBut we want to go to 9, so probably U or S, but S stays, so better to go up.\n\nNow, unsafe freeways:\n\ny=3 unsafe at T=10\n\ny=7 unsafe at T=10\n\ny=1 unsafe at T=16,17,18\n\ny=8 unsafe at T=16,17,18\n\nOthers always safe.\n\ny=9 safe.\n\nNow, from y=5, to go to y=9, I need to go through y=6,7,8,9.\n\ny=6 always safe, y=7 unsafe at T=10, y=8 unsafe at T=16,17,18, y=9 safe.\n\nT=10 is soon, since we start at T=9.\n\nIf I move up immediately.\n\nAt T=9, y=5, safe.\n\na_9 = U, then y_10=6\n\nAt T=10, y=6, which is freeway 6, always safe, so no problem.\n\nThen a_10 = U, y_11=7\n\nAt T=11, y=7, freeway 7.\n\nFreeway 7 is unsafe only at T=10, but T=11, so safe, since unsafe only at T=10.\n\nThen a_11 = U, y_12=8\n\nAt T=12, y=8, freeway 8.\n\nFreeway 8 unsafe at T=16,17,18, but T=12 is before, so safe? At T=12, Δt =12-9=3, freeway 8 unsafe only at Δt=7,8,9 T=16,17,18, so at T=12, safe.\n\nThen a_12 = U, y_13=9\n\nAt T=13, y=9, which is not a freeway, or safe, so we reach y=9 at T=13.\n\nH is the number of turns, from start to end.\n\nStart at turn t1=9, position y=5.\n\nAfter actions, we reach at some turn T with y=9.\n\nThe minimal H such that after H-1 actions, we are at y=9 at turn t1 + H -1.\n\nHere, from above, with actions: a_9=U, a_10=U, a_11=U, a_12=U, then at turn 13, y=9.\n\nSo turns: 9,10,11,12,13. At turn 9 y=5, turn 10 y=6, turn 11 y=7, turn 12 y=8, turn 13 y=9.\n\nSo we reach y=9 at turn 13, which is t1 + H -1 =9 + H -1 =13, so 8 + H =13? 9 + H -1 =13, so H-1=4, H=5.\n\nt1 + H -1 =13, t1=9, so 9 + H -1 =13, 8 + H =13, H=5.\n\nActions from t=9 to t=12, that's 4 actions, H-1=4, H=5.\n\nIn the sequence, we have actions for t=9,10,11,12.\n\nNow, check if all positions are safe.\n\nAt T=9, y=5, freeway 5, always safe, ok.\n\nAt T=10, y=6, freeway 6, always safe, ok.\n\nAt T=11, y=7, freeway 7. Freeway 7 unsafe at T=10, but T=11, so safe, as we said.\n\nAt T=12, y=8, freeway 8. Unsafe at T=16,17,18, T=12 is before, so safe.\n\nAt T=13, y=9, safe.\n\nSo this seems fine, H=5.\n\nBut is there a shorter path? H=5 means 4 actions to go from 5 to 9, which is 4 steps, minimal possible since we move one per turn.\n\nCould I reach faster by staying or something? Staying would take more turns, so no.\n\nOr going down and up, but that would take more turns, so not minimal.\n\nSo H=5 should be minimal.\n\nBut let me confirm the car positions.\n\nFor example, at T=11, y=7.\n\nFreeway 7 has car: same as freeway 3, (-12,-47,right,36)\n\nAt T=11, Δt=11-9=2\n\nSpan: [-47 + 36*2, -12 + 36*2] = [-47+72, -12+72] = [25,60], 0 not in, safe.\n\nAt T=12, y=8, freeway 8.\n\nCars: first car span at T: [-39 +4*3, -28 +4*3] since Δt=3, [-39+12, -28+12] = [-27,-16], 0 not in.\n\nOther cars not relevant.\n\nSafe.\n\nAt T=10, y=6, freeway 6, which has car (36,25,right,12), span at T=10, Δt=1, [25+12,36+12]=[37,48], 0 not in.\n\nAll good.\n\nBut in the sequence, I have to output actions starting from t_1=9.\n\nIn the answer, it should be:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} etc.\n\nt_1=9.\n\nSo actions: at turn 9: U, turn 10: U, turn 11: U, turn 12: U.\n\nThen at turn 13, y=9, but no action for turn 13, since we reach at the end of turn 12 or something?\n\nThe position is after the action.\n\nAt turn t, after action a_t, we have y_{t+1}, but at turn t, we are at y_t before action? I need to clarify the timing.\n\nFrom the player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, where Δy_t depends on a_t.\n\nSo at the beginning of turn t, player is at y_t.\n\nThen we choose action a_t, which determines Δy_t, then y_{t+1} is set for next turn.\n\nBut at turn t, during the turn, we are at position y_t, and that's when we might collide if on freeway with car at 0.\n\nAfter action, we move to new position for next turn.\n\nThe collision condition: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd y_T is the position at turn T.\n\nAlso, note: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nBut in this case, at turn T, you are on y_T, so you only care about cars on y_T at turn T.\n\nIn my sequence, at each turn, we are on the freeway and safe.\n\nIn the minimal case, with 4 up actions, we reach in 4 actions, so H=5 turns including start.\n\nBut let me see if I can do it in fewer.\n\nSuppose at T=9, I do S, stay, then y still 5, but then I need to move later, so it would take at least as many turns, no benefit.\n\nOr if I go down, but y=4 is freeway 4, always safe, but then I have to go up more, so more turns.\n\nFor example, if I go to y=4 at T=10, then to y=5 at T=11, etc., but that would take more than 4 steps to reach 9.\n\nSince from 5 to 9 is 4 steps, minimal actions is 4, so H=5 is minimal.\n\nAnd in this case, it works.\n\nBut earlier I thought y=7 unsafe at T=10, but in my sequence I am at y=7 at T=11, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=8 at T=12, safe.\n\nBut is there a problem with other freeways? For example, when I move, I might be on different rows.\n\nIn this path, I only visit y=5,6,7,8,9.\n\ny=5 at T=9, safe.\n\ny=6 at T=10, safe.\n\ny=7 at T=11, safe (since unsafe only at T=10).\n\ny=8 at T=12, safe (unsafe later).\n\ny=9 at T=13, safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nPerhaps I can go faster, but I don't think so.\n\nAnother thing: the player can stay, but that would not help to reach faster.\n\nOr move down, but counterproductive.\n\nSo minimal H=5.\n\nBut let me check if at some point, when I move, but since collision only when on the freeway at that turn, and we are safe.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 7, at T=10, it is unsafe, but I am not there at T=10.\n\nIn my sequence, at T=10, I am at y=6, not y=7.\n\ny=7 is unsafe at T=10, but I am there at T=11.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nNow, the answer should be the sequence.\n\nt_1=9, so:\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nThen at turn 13, y=9, but we don't need action for turn 13, since we have reached.\n\nThe sequence is for t from t_1 to t_1 + H-2, I think.\n\nIn the answer format: {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}, let's see.\n\n\"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\"\n\nIn the task: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} which minimizes H such that y_{t_1 + H -1} =9\"\n\na_{t_1 + t} for t from 0 to H-1.\n\nt from 0 to H-1, so that's H actions.\n\nThen y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nAfter H actions, we are at turn t_1 + H, with y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nLet's clarify.\n\nDefine the turns.\n\nSet t_index = t_1 + t for t=0,1,2,...,H-1\n\nThen for each k from 0 to H-1, we have action a_{t_1 + k}\n\nThen after action a_{t_1 + k}, the position is y_{t_1 + k + 1}\n\nBecause y_{t+1} = y_t + delta with a_t.\n\nStart: at turn t_1, position y_{t_1} =5\n\nAfter action a_{t_1}, position y_{t_1 +1}\n\n...\n\nAfter action a_{t_1 + (H-1)}, position y_{t_1 + H}\n\nWe want y_{t_1 + H -1} =9? Inconsistency.\n\nFrom the task: \"y_{t_1 + H -1} =9\"\n\nAnd actions from t=0 to H-1 for the offset.\n\nt from 0 to H-1, so actions at times: t_1 + 0, t_1 +1, ..., t_1 + (H-1)\n\nAfter these actions, the position at turn t_1 + H should be 9? No.\n\nAfter action a_t, y_{t+1} is set.\n\nSo after a_{t_1 + (H-1)}, y_{t_1 + H} is set.\n\nBut we want y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\ny_{t_1 + H -1} is the position at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nAt turn t_1 + H -1, position is y_{t_1 + H -1}, and we take action a_{t_1 + H -1}, which may change it.\n\nBut we want y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, meaning at that turn, we are already at 9.\n\nIn terms of the sequence, at turn t_1 + H -1, we are at position 9, and we might take an action, but since we are already at 9, the action could be S or something, but we need to reach at that turn.\n\nIn this case, for H=5, t_1 + H -1 =9+5-1=13, so at turn 13, y=9.\n\nNow, the actions are from t=0 to H-1=4, so actions at t_1 + t for t=0,1,2,3,4? t from 0 to H-1.\n\nH=5, t from 0 to 4, so actions at t_1 +0 =9, t_1+1=10, t_1+2=11, t_1+3=12, t_1+4=13.\n\nBut at turn 13, we want y_{13}=9, but if we take action at turn 13, it would change y to something else, but we want to be at 9 at turn 13.\n\nI think there is confusion.\n\nLet me read the task carefully.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9), ... such that y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\"\n\nAlso, \"after H-1 actions\" is mentioned.\n\nPerhaps the actions are taken from turn t_1 to t_1 + H - 2, and at turn t_1 + H -1, we are at y=9.\n\nIn the sequence index, it says {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}, which includes H actions.\n\nBut for H turns, from start to end, we have H positions and H-1 actions? Let's think.\n\nStandard: at turn t, position y_t.\n\nAction a_t taken, then y_{t+1} = y_t + delta y_t.\n\nThe sequence from turn t to turn t + k has k+1 positions and k actions.\n\nHere, we start at turn t_1, y_{t_1} given.\n\nWe end at some turn T, with y_T =9.\n\nThe number of turns from start to end is T - t_1 + 1.\n\nSet H as the number of turns, meaning we reach at turn t_1 + H - 1.\n\nFor example, at t_1, turn 1 of the sequence.\n\nAfter 0 actions, at turn t_1, position y_{t_1}.\n\nAfter 1 action, at turn t_1 +1, position y_{t_1 +1}, and so on.\n\nAfter k actions, at turn t_1 + k, position y_{t_1 + k}.\n\nWe want y_{t_1 + H -1} =9 after H-1 actions? Let's see.\n\nAfter H-1 actions, we are at turn t_1 + (H-1), position y_{t_1 + H -1}.\n\nAnd we set this to 9.\n\nThe actions are from turn t_1 to t_1 + H - 2, total H-1 actions.\n\nBut in the sequence, it is indexed as {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}, which would be t from 0 to H-1, that's H actions, at times t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nThen after a_{t_1 + H -1}, y_{t_1 + H} is set.\n\nBut we want y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nSo if we have actions up to a_{t_1 + H -1}, it affects y_{t_1 + H}, not y_{t_1 + H -1}.\n\nI think there is a mistake in the indexing.\n\nPerhaps the sequence {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} is for the actions that bring us to the position.\n\nI think it's better to look at the answer format.\n\nThe answer format is:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\n\nTurn t_1 +1: a_{t_1 +1}\n\n...\n\nup to the last action before reaching.\n\nAnd in the box, it should be the actions.\n\nIn the task: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\"\n\nAnd \"such that y_{t_1 + H -1} =9\"\n\nFor this to hold, with actions from t=0 to H-1, we need that after the actions, y_{t_1 + H -1} is 9.\n\nBut y_{t_1 + H -1} is determined by the previous actions.\n\nAt turn t_1 + H -1, position y_{t_1 + H -1}, which depends on actions up to a_{t_1 + H -2}.\n\nThe action a_{t_1 + H -1} is taken at turn t_1 + H -1, which affects y_{t_1 + H}, not y_{t_1 + H -1}.\n\nTo have y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, we need that at the beginning of turn t_1 + H -1, we are at 9, and we may take an action, but since we are at 9, we can take S or U or D, but U or D would move away, so probably we take S or just reach and stop, but the action is part of the sequence.\n\nTo minimize H, we probably reach exactly at that turn.\n\nIn this case, for my sequence, at turn 13, y=9.\n\nNow, the actions: from turn 9 to turn 12, actions U,U,U,U.\n\nThen at turn 13, we are at y=9, but if we need an action for turn 13, it could be S, but since we are already at 9, and H is defined with y_{t_1 + H -1}=9.\n\nLet's assume that at turn t_1 + H -1, we are at 9, and we may have an action, but it doesn't change the position if we stay, but we need to specify the action.\n\nIn the minimal case, we can have the last action bringing us to 9 or being at 9.\n\nIn my earlier, with actions at t=9,10,11,12: all U, then at turn 13, y=9.\n\nSo y_{13} =9.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =13, t_1=9, so 9 + H -1 =13, H=5.\n\nThe actions are for t from 0 to H-1=4? t from 0 to 4, actions at t_1+0 to t_1+4, that is turn 9 to 13.\n\nBut at turn 13, if we take action, y_{14} might change, but we want y_{13}=9.\n\nSo for turn 13, we should not take an action that changes y, so we can take S.\n\nThen the sequence includes a_{13} = S.\n\nBut that adds an extra action.\n\nLet's see the index.\n\nThe sequence {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} for H=5, t from 0 to 4, actions at 9,10,11,12,13.\n\nThen y_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{9+5-1} = y_{13}.\n\nAt turn 13, we are at y_{13}, before taking action a_{13}.\n\nThen we take a_{13}, which sets y_{14}.\n\nBut we want y_{13} =9, which is set by previous actions.\n\nIn this case, with actions at 9,10,11,12, we set y_{10},y_{11},y_{12},y_{13}.\n\nSpecifically, a_9 sets y_{10}, a_{10} sets y_{11}, ..., a_{12} sets y_{13}.\n\nThen at turn 13, we are at y_{13}, and we take a_{13} which sets y_{14}, but since we want y_{13}=9, and we are done, a_{13} can be anything, but probably we need to specify, and to stay, we can set S.\n\nBut in the position, we are at 9 at turn 13.\n\nIn the collision, at turn 13, we are on y=9, which is safe, no issue.\n\nThen for the sequence, we have actions from t=9 to t=13.\n\nBut for t=13, action a_{13} doesn't affect reaching, but we have to include it in the sequence since t from 0 to H-1.\n\nFor H=5, actions at t_1 to t_1+4, that is 5 actions.\n\nBut with 4 up actions, we reach y=9 at turn 13, so for action at turn 13, we can set S to stay, or U to go to 10, but y=10 not exist, y max 9, so U would not change, or D to 8, but we don't want to move away.\n\nThe player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + delta y, with y in [0,9], so if at y=9 and U, y_{t+1} = min(9+1,9)=9, similarly at 0 D, stays 0.\n\nSo at y=9, U or S both keep y=9.\n\nSimilarly, D would go to 8.\n\nBut to stay, we can do S or U.\n\nIn the sequence, for the last action, since we are at 9, we can do S.\n\nIn my case, with actions at 9,10,11,12: U, we have y_{10}=6, y_{11}=7, y_{12}=8, y_{13}=9.\n\nThen at turn 13, we are at y=9, and we need action a_{13}, which for the sequence, we can set S.\n\nThen H=5, actions: a9=U, a10=U, a11=U, a12=U, a13=S.\n\nBut with a13=S, we stay at 9.\n\nBut we reached at turn 13 with y=9.\n\nIf we don't include a13, but the sequence requires t from 0 to H-1 for H actions.\n\nPerhaps H includes the turn we reach.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nBut in this case, with only 4 actions U from t9 to t12, we reach at t13, so for H=5, we have an extra action at t13.\n\nBut since we must have the sequence for t=0 to H-1, we include it.\n\nTo avoid the extra action, we could reach earlier, but we start at y=5, so minimum 4 actions to reach y=9.\n\nAt turn 9, y=5, after first action, y=6 at turn 10, etc., after fourth action, y=9 at turn 13.\n\nSo turn 13 is when we first reach y=9.\n\nThen at turn 13, we are at y=9, and we take an action for the sequence, but it's the turn we reach.\n\nWith H=5, it includes the action at the reach turn.\n\nIn the collision, at turn 13, y=9, safe, and we take S, fine.\n\nIf I can reach at an earlier turn, but I can't from y=5.\n\nSuppose I start at turn 9, y=5, if I could be at y=9 at turn 9, but I can't, since only one move per turn.\n\nMinimal is to reach at turn 13.\n\nAnother way: if I do nothing, but that takes longer.\n\nSo H=5 is minimal.\n\nIn the sequence, actions: for t from 0 to 4 (since H=5, t=0,1,2,3,4)\n\na_{t1 + t} for t=0: a9, t=1: a10, t=2: a11, t=3: a12, t=4: a13\n\nNow a9=U, a10=U, a11=U, a12=U, a13=S\n\nBut a12=U sets y13= y12 +1, but y12=8, so y13=9.\n\nThen a13=S, sets y14=9, but we don't care about y14.\n\nAnd at turn 13, we are on y=9, safe.\n\nIn the sequence, we can output:\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: S\n\nBut is the S necessary? Since we reach at turn 13, and the action at turn 13 might not be needed, but according to the indexing, we include it.\n\nTo save an action, but we can't, since we need to specify the sequence for H actions.\n\nPerhaps for H=4, but let's see.\n\nIf H=4, then t1 + H -1 =9+4-1=12, so y12=9.\n\nActions from t=0 to 3: a9,a10,a11,a12.\n\nThen y_{t1 + H -1} = y12 =9.\n\nNow, with actions a9,a10,a11, we need to set y12=9.\n\nStart at t9, y9=5.\n\na9 sets y10.\n\na10 sets y11.\n\na11 sets y12.\n\nSo with three actions, from y9=5 to y12=9, that means we need to increase by 4 in 3 steps, which requires moving up every time, but y from 5 to 9 is +4, in 3 actions: if all U, y10=6, y11=7, y12=8, not 9.\n\ny12=8, not 9.\n\nIf we move faster, but we can only change by 1 per action, so impossible to reach y=9 in 3 actions from y=5.\n\nWith 3 actions, maximum y12=5+3=8, if all U.\n\nMinimum y12=5-3=2 if all D.\n\nCannot reach y=9.\n\nSo H=4 is impossible.\n\nH=5 is minimal.\n\nWith H=5, we have actions to set y13=9.\n\nIn the sequence with a13=S, it's fine.\n\nBut in the action at turn 13, we set S, which is not necessary, but acceptable.\n\nWe can have the last action be U to reach, but in this case, with a12=U, we set y13=9, so at turn 13, we are at 9.\n\nThen a13 can be S to stay.\n\nBut in the sequence, it's included.\n\nNow, back to the path, is there any issue with the cars?\n\nEarlier I thought it was fine, but let me double-check the unsafe times.\n\nAt T=10, y=3 and y=7 are unsafe.\n\nIn my sequence, at T=10, I am at y=6, which is safe.\n\nAt T=11, y=7, which is safe because unsafe only at T=10 for y=7.\n\nSimilarly, no problem.\n\nBut is there a car on y=6 at some time? No, y=6 always safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=8 at T=12, safe.\n\nBut what about later unsafe times, like T=16, but we are at T=13, so no issue.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if I need to wait or something, but not necessary.\n\nAnother thing: the player can stay on a freeway to avoid bad times.\n\nFor example, if I go to y=6 at T=10, which is safe, but if I stay there for some turns, but that would increase H, not minimal.\n\nSince I can go directly, no need.\n\nIn this case, it works.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 8, there is a car at (12,1,right,4) at t1, span [1,12], which includes 0? At t1, [1,12], 0 not in, but at earlier times, but since we start at t1, not concerned.\n\nAt T=12, as I said, safe.\n\nPerhaps I should list the actions directly.\n\nSo minimal H=5.\n\nSequence: a9=U, a10=U, a11=U, a12=U, a13=S\n\nIn the answer, since a13=S is just to stay, but we can specify the actions to reach.\n\nBut I think it's acceptable.\n\nTo have only four actions, but with H=5, we need five actions in the sequence.\n\nPerhaps the indexing is different.\n\nI think I should go with it.\n\nNow, in the output, for turn t1=9.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: S\n\nBut let me confirm if at any point collision.\n\nAt turn 9: y=5, freeway 5, cars: (36,25,right,12), at T=9, span [25,36], 0 not in, safe.\n\nAction U, go to y=6.\n\nTurn 10: y=6, freeway 6, same as above, [25,36] at t1, but at T=10, Δt=1, [25+12,36+12]=[37,48], 0 not in, safe.\n\nAction U, go to y=7.\n\nTurn 11: y=7, freeway 7, car (-12,-47,right,36), at T=11, Δt=2, [-47+72, -12+72]=[25,60], 0 not in, safe.\n\nAction U, go to y=8.\n\nTurn 12: y=8, freeway 8, cars: first (-28,-39,right,4), at T=12, Δt=3, [-39+12, -28+12]=[-27,-16], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car (48,37,right,4), [37+12,48+12]=[49,60], no.\n\nThird (12,1,right,4), [1+12,12+12]=[13,24], no. All safe.\n\nAction U, go to y=9.\n\nTurn 13: y=9, not a freeway, or safe, no cars. Action S, stay, but not necessary, but we set it.\n\nSo all good.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is U,U,U,U,S for turns 9 to 13.\n\nH=5.\n\nNow, in the box.\n\nBut the answer should be in the format.\n\nAlso, the current turn is t_0=9, but in the task, it says current turn is t_1, and in the state, it says \"Current Turn: t_0 =9\", but in the task description, it says \"current turn is {t_1}\", so I think t_1=9.\n\nIn the state, it says \"Current Turn: t_0 =9\", but in the task, it says \"current turn is {t_1}\", so probably t_1=9.\n\nI'll use t_1=9.\n\nSo the answer:\n\n\\boxed{ Turn 9: U \\\\ Turn 10: U \\\\ Turn 11: U \\\\ Turn 12: U \\\\ Turn 13: S }\n\nBut in the sequence, for t from 0 to H-1=4, actions at 9,10,11,12,13.\n\nYes.\n\nTo avoid S, but it's fine.\n\nI think this is correct.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 5) at turn \\(t_1 = 9\\) and aims to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis:\n- From the initial position \\(y = 5\\), the player must move up to reach \\(y = 9\\), requiring at least 4 upward moves (since each move changes \\(y\\) by at most +1).\n- The minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 5, as it takes 4 actions to move from \\(y = 5\\) to \\(y = 9\\), and the position \\(y = 9\\) is reached at turn \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 9 + 5 - 1 = 13\\).\n- The sequence of actions must ensure that at each turn \\(T\\), the player is not on a freeway \\(y_T\\) where a car's span includes 0 at that turn.\n\n#### Safety Check for Freeways:\n- **Freeway 1**: Unsafe at turns \\(T = 16, 17, 18\\) (due to car at \\((-28, -39, \\text{right}, 4)\\)). Safe at \\(T = 9\\) to \\(T = 15\\) and beyond.\n- **Freeway 2**: Always safe (no car spans include 0 at any turn).\n- **Freeway 3**: Unsafe only at \\(T = 10\\) (due to car at \\((-12, -47, \\text{right}, 36)\\)).

Safe otherwise.\n- **Freeway 8**: Unsafe at turns \\(T = 16, 17, 18\\) (due to car at \\((-28, -39, \\text{right}, 4)\\)). Safe at \\(T = 9\\) to \\(T = 15\\) and beyond.\n\n#### Proposed Action Sequence:\n- At turn \\(T = 9\\): Player is at \\(y = 5\\) (freeway 5, safe). Action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 6\\).\n- At turn \\(T = 10\\): Player is at \\(y = 6\\) (freeway 6, safe).

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at position (0, 6) at turn t_1 = 10. The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing the y-position by +1, -1, or 0 respectively, but y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCollision occurs only if at some turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there's a car such that 0 is in its span at that exact turn T. The note says that if you move to a different y at turn T, you're not on that new y until the next turn. So at turn T, you're on y_T, and if you move, you'll be on y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nNow, I need to model the car movements. Each car has a head, tail, direction, and speed. For left-moving cars (d = left), the span moves left, so head and tail decrease by s per turn. For right-moving (d = right), head and tail increase by s per turn.\n\nThe car state is given for freeways 1 to 8. Let me list out all cars for each freeway at turn t_1=10.\n\n- Freeway 1: two cars\n  - Car 1: (-24, -35, right, 4) — but head and tail: if direction is right, and it's moving right, head should be greater than tail? The notation says for left-moving, span is [h, τ] with h > τ? Let's see the car update.\n\nIn the car update, for left-moving: span(t1) = [h, τ] → span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nFor right-moving: span(t1) = [τ, h] → span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nI think there might be inconsistency in notation. Let me read carefully.\n\nIt says: for left-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\"\n\nAnd for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\"\n\nIn the right-moving case, it says Span(t1) = [τ, h], which might imply that τ is the left end and h is the right end, so for right-moving, τ < h, and it moves right, so both increase.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, Span(t1) = [h, τ], which might have h > τ, so h is right, τ is left, and both decrease.\n\nBut in the given data, for freeway 1: (-24, -35, right, 4)\n\nIf direction is right, and Span(t1) = [τ, h], so for this car, τ = -24, h = -35? But -24 > -35, so if τ = -24, h = -35, then τ > h, which would mean the left end is h = -35, right end is τ = -24? But that doesn't make sense because usually we expect left end smaller.\n\nI think there's confusion in the notation. Let me interpret based on the update rule.\n\nFor a right-moving car, Span(t1) = [τ, h] with τ and h such that τ is the tail (left end) and h is the head (right end), so τ < h.\n\nThen at T, [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] where ΔT = T - t1.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, Span(t1) = [h, τ] with h head (right end), τ tail (left end), so h > τ, and at T, [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT].\n\nIn the data, for freeway 1, first car: (-24, -35, right, 4)\n\nIf direction right, Span(t1) should be [τ, h], so τ = -24, h = -35? But -24 > -35, so τ = -24, h = -35 implies τ > h, which is inconsistent if τ should be left, h right.\n\nPerhaps the numbers are given as (head, tail, direction, speed), but the head and tail might not be in order.\n\nLet's look at the values: -24 and -35, -35 is smaller, so if direction right, and it's moving right, the left end should be smaller.\n\nI think it's likely that for the car data, it's given as (head, tail) but without specifying which is which, but from the context, for right-moving, in the span it's [τ, h] with τ left, h right, so τ < h.\n\nHere for first car on freeway 1: (-24, -35, right, 4), -24 > -35, so if τ and h, it could be that τ = -35 (left), h = -24 (right), but the data says (head, tail), so let's see the notation.\n\nIn the car state table, it says \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nSo for each car, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nBut head and tail: which one is which? From the update rule, for left-moving, span is [h, τ], and for right-moving, span is [τ, h].\n\nIn the left-moving case, [h, τ], and it moves left, so h decreases, so h is likely the right end or head.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving, [τ, h], moves right, τ increases, so τ is likely the left end or tail.\n\nSo generally, head is the front, tail is the back.\n\nFor a car moving right, head is on the right, tail on the left, so at position, head > tail.\n\nFor car moving left, head on left, tail on right, so head < tail.\n\nThen for the span:\n\n- If direction right, car moving right, head is high x, tail is low x, so span is [tail, head] with tail < head.\n\nIn update, for right-moving, span(t1) = [τ, h] → [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT], so τ is left end (tail), h is right end (head), τ < h.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, span(t1) = [h, τ] → [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT], so h is right end (head), τ is left end (tail), so for left-moving, head is on left, so head (h) is smaller than tail (τ)? Let's clarify.\n\nIf a car is moving left, its head is pointing left, so at a given time, the head has smaller x, tail has larger x, so left end is head, right end is tail, so span is [head, tail] with head < tail? But in the notation, it's [h, τ], and for left-moving, it's [h, τ], which becomes [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT], so if the car moves left, both decrease, so if initially h and τ, after moving left, h - sΔT and τ - sΔT, so if h < τ, then [h, τ] with h left, τ right, moving left.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving, [τ, h] with τ left, h right, moving right.\n\nIn the data, for freeway 1, first car: (head h, tail τ, d, s) = (-24, -35, right, 4)\n\nFor right-moving, head should be on right, tail on left, so if head is -24, tail is -35, but -24 > -35, so head at -24, tail at -35, so left end is tail -35, right end is head -24, so span is [tail, head] = [-35, -24], and since direction right, it should be [τ, h] with τ = tail = -35, h = head = -24.\n\nBut in the given, it's written as (head, tail) = (-24, -35), so for right-moving, the span is [tail, head] = [-35, -24], but in the notation, it says for right-moving, span(t1) = [τ, h], so τ is tail, h is head.\n\nIn this case, τ = -35, h = -24, so [τ, h] = [-35, -24].\n\nSimilarly, for the second car on freeway 1: (40, 29, right, 4). Head 40, tail 29, so for right-moving, tail should be left, head right, but 29 < 40, so tail 29, head 40, span [29,40].\n\nNow for freeway 2: (-48, -25, left, 24). Direction left, so for left-moving, span(t1) = [h, τ], with h head, τ tail.\n\nHead is given as -48, tail -25. If moving left, head should be on left, so if head is -48, tail is -25, and -48 < -25, so left end head -48, right end tail -25, span [h, τ] = [-48, -25], and it moves left.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nI think I have it.\n\nSo let's list for each freeway the cars with their spans at t1=10.\n\nFreeway k, cars: (head, tail, direction, speed)\n\nBut span at t1:\n\n- For right-moving (d=right): span = [tail, head] since tail left, head right.\n\nIn notation, [τ, h] with τ tail, h head.\n\n- For left-moving (d=left): span = [head, tail] with head left, tail right, so [h, τ] with h head, τ tail.\n\nIn both cases, the span is from left to right, with left end min, right end max.\n\nFor a car:\n\n- If d=right: left end = tail, right end = head, and tail < head.\n\n- If d=left: left end = head, right end = tail, and head < tail.\n\nIn the data, for d=right, head and tail given, with head > tail typically, but in freeway 1 first car, head=-24, tail=-35, head > tail since -24 > -35.\n\nSimilarly second car head=40, tail=29, 40>29.\n\nFor d=left, freeway 2: head=-48, tail=-25, and -48 < -25, so head < tail.\n\nOthers similar.\n\nNow for freeway 3: (24, -11, right, 36). d=right, head=24, tail=-11, tail=-11, head=24, so left end tail=-11, right end head=24, span [-11,24] at t1.\n\nBut tail=-11, head=24, so min is tail, max is head.\n\nFreeway 4: (48, 37, right, 12), head=48, tail=37, 37<48, span [37,48]\n\nFreeway 5: same as 4, (48,37,right,12), span [37,48]\n\nFreeway 6: same, (48,37,right,12), span [37,48]\n\nFreeway 7: (24,-11,right,36), same as freeway 3, span [-11,24]\n\nFreeway 8: three cars: (-24,-35,right,4), (52,41,right,4), (16,5,right,4)\n\nFirst car: head=-24, tail=-35, d=right, span [tail, head] = [-35,-24]\n\nSecond car: head=52, tail=41, span [41,52]\n\nThird car: head=16, tail=5, span [5,16]\n\nNow, the player starts at y=6 at t=10.\n\nGoal: reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nSince y=9 is the top, and player can only move up, down, or stay, but to minimize turns, probably want to move up as much as possible, but need to avoid collisions when on freeways 1 to 8.\n\nAt y=9, it's not a freeway, I assume, since freeways are y=1 to 8, so at y=0 and y=9, no cars, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 is safe, but we want y=9.\n\nNow, collision only when on y=k for k=1 to 8, and at that turn, for that freeway, 0 is in some car's span.\n\nThe player is at x=0 always, I think, since only y changes, x is fixed at 0.\n\nThe grid is 2D, but player moves only vertically, cars move horizontally, so at each turn, player chooses y-change, and cars move based on their speed.\n\nAt turn T, player is at some y_T, and for that y, if y between 1 and 8, we check if 0 is in any car's span on that freeway at turn T.\n\nNow, since the player position y changes only when action U or D is taken, and at turn T, after action, y_{T} is set.\n\nLet's clarify the turn sequence.\n\nAt turn t, player is at position (0, y_t)\n\nThen chooses action a_t, which determines y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with Δy_t based on a_t.\n\nThen at turn t+1, player is at (0, y_{t+1}), and so on.\n\nCollision at turn T if y_T is between 1 and 8, and for freeway y_T, there exists a car such that 0 is in its span at turn T.\n\nThe note says: if you move to y_{T+1} != y_T at turn T, you are not on y_{T+1} at turn T, only at turn T+1.\n\nSo at turn T, you are on y_T, and you might move to y_{T+1} for the next turn.\n\nNow, to reach y=9 from y=6, minimum number of turns if no cars would be 3 turns: up, up, up, to y=7,8,9.\n\nBut with cars, we need to check if on any freeway between, at the time, 0 is not occupied.\n\nSince we start at t=10, and we need to find actions from t=10 onwards.\n\nLet me denote the turns starting from t=10.\n\nAt t=10, player at y=6.\n\nWe need to find a sequence of actions a_{10}, a_{11}, a_{12}, ... until y=9 is reached.\n\nLet H be the number of turns from t=10, so after H actions, at turn t=10 + H, y should be 9? Let's see.\n\nAt turn t=10, y=6.\n\nAfter action a_{10}, at turn t=11, y_{11} = y_{10} + Δy based on a_{10}\n\n...\n\nAfter action a_{10 + k}, at turn t=10 + k + 1? Let's index properly.\n\nThe turn when position is set: at turn t, position is y_t.\n\nAfter action a_t, y_{t+1} is determined.\n\nWe want y_{t_final} = 9 for some final turn.\n\nThe sequence of actions from t=10 to t=10 + H - 1, so H actions, and after H actions, at turn t=10 + H, y_{10+H} should be 9.\n\nFor example, if no cars, from y=6, after U at t=10, y=7 at t=11; U at t=11, y=8 at t=12; U at t=12, y=9 at t=13. So H=3 actions, at t=10,11,12, and y=9 at t=13.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t=10 to t=10+H-1.\n\nWith cars, we need to ensure that for each turn when player is on freeway y=1 to 8, no collision.\n\nPlayer starts at y=6 at t=10, so at t=10, on freeway 6, need to check if collision at t=10 on freeway 6.\n\nThen depending on actions, at subsequent turns.\n\nFirst, let's compute for each freeway and each car, the span at any turn T.\n\nSince we care about when x=0 is occupied, which is when the span covers 0.\n\nFor a car on a freeway, at turn T, 0 is in span if left_end(T) <= 0 <= right_end(T)\n\nAnd since the car moves at constant speed, we can find when this happens.\n\nBut for each freeway, we have multiple cars, so we need the union of spans.\n\nFor a given freeway, at turn T, collision if 0 is in any car's span on that freeway.\n\nOtherwise safe.\n\nNow, for the player to be safe at turn T on freeway k, we need that at that turn, for freeway k, 0 not covered.\n\nSince we start from t=10, and we go forward.\n\nFirst, let's list for each freeway the cars and their movement.\n\nSet t1=10, so ΔT = T - 10 for T >=10.\n\nFor each freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: k=1, cars:\n\nCar A: d=right, s=4, at t=10, span [τ, h] = [-35, -24] since tail=-35, head=-24? Earlier: (head, tail) = (-24, -35), so for d=right, tail=-35, head=-24, so span [tail, head] = [-35, -24]\n\nAt T, span = [ -35 + 4*(T-10), -24 + 4*(T-10) ]\n\nSimilarly, car B: (40,29,right,4), head=40, tail=29, span [29,40] at t=10\n\nAt T, [29 + 4*(T-10), 40 + 4*(T-10)]\n\nNow, 0 in span for car A if -35 +4ΔT <= 0 <= -24 +4ΔT, which is impossible since both ends negative and increasing, min at T=10 is -35, max -24, both <0, and increasing, so never covers 0. Similarly, car B [29,40] to [29+4ΔT,40+4ΔT], min 29>0, so always >0, never covers 0. So freeway 1 is always safe, no car covers 0 at any time.\n\nCar A: left end -35 +4ΔT, at ΔT=0, -35, increases, so for large T, positive, but when does it cover 0?\n\n-35 +4ΔT <=0 <= -24 +4ΔT\n\nFirst inequality: -35 +4ΔT <=0 => 4ΔT <=35 => ΔT <= 35/4=8.75\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= -24 +4ΔT => 4ΔT >=24 => ΔT >=6\n\nSo for ΔT between 6 and 8.75, i.e., T from 16 to 18.75, so turns T=16,17,18, since T integer, at T=16,17,18, 0 might be covered if in span.\n\nAt T=16, ΔT=6, span: left = -35 +4*6 = -35+24= -11, right= -24 +24=0? -24+24=0, so [ -11, 0], so 0 included.\n\nAt T=17, ΔT=7, left=-35+28= -7, right=-24+28=4, so [-7,4], 0 in.\n\nT=18, ΔT=8, left=-35+32= -3, right=-24+32=8, [-3,8], 0 in.\n\nT=19, ΔT=9, left=-35+36=1, right=-24+36=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, for car B: [29+4ΔT,40+4ΔT], always >0, never covers 0.\n\nSo for freeway 1, collision at T=16,17,18.\n\nBut since we start at T=10, and we care about future turns, but for player on freeway 1 at those turns, collision.\n\nBut freeway 1 might be safe at other times.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 2: one car, (-48,-25,left,24)\n\nd=left, so span at t=10: [h, τ] = [-48, -25] since head=-48, tail=-25\n\nAt T, span: [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT] = [-48 -24ΔT, -25 -24ΔT]\n\nSince s=24, high speed.\n\nNow, 0 in span if -48 -24ΔT <= 0 <= -25 -24ΔT\n\nBut left end -48-24ΔT <0 always, decreasing.\n\nRight end -25-24ΔT, at ΔT=0, -25<0, decreasing, so both ends negative, so 0 never in span. Always negative, so freeway 2 always safe.\n\nFreeway 3: (24,-11,right,36) head=24, tail=-11, d=right, span at t=10: [τ,h] = [-11,24]\n\nAt T: [ -11 +36ΔT, 24 +36ΔT]\n\n0 in span if -11 +36ΔT <=0 <=24 +36ΔT\n\nFirst: -11 +36ΔT <=0 => 36ΔT <=11 => ΔT <= 11/36 ≈ 0.305, so only for ΔT=0, but at ΔT=0, T=10, left=-11<0, right=24>0, so 0 in span? -11 <=0<=24, yes.\n\nAt T=10, ΔT=0, span [-11,24], 0 is between -11 and 24, so yes, covered.\n\nFor ΔT>0, -11 +36ΔT, at ΔT=1, T=11, left=-11+36=25>0, so [25,60], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, only at T=10, 0 covered? Let's see.\n\n-11 +36ΔT <=0 <=24 +36ΔT\n\nSince 24+36ΔT >0 always for ΔT>=0.\n\nLeft: -11 +36ΔT <=0 => ΔT <= 11/36 <1, so only possible at ΔT=0.\n\nAt ΔT=0, -11 <=0<=24, true.\n\nAt ΔT=1, 25 <=0<=60? 25<=0 false.\n\nSo only at T=10, 0 covered for freeway 3.\n\nBut at T=10, player is not on freeway 3, player is on y=6 at t=10.\n\nFreeway 3 is y=3.\n\nSo at t=10, on freeway 3, 0 is occupied, but player not there.\n\nFor other times, no coverage.\n\nFreeway 4: (48,37,right,12) head=48, tail=37, d=right, span [37,48] at t=10\n\nAt T: [37+12ΔT, 48+12ΔT]\n\nAlways min 37>0, so never covers 0. Safe always.\n\nFreeway 5: same as freeway 4, (48,37,right,12), always safe.\n\nFreeway 6: same, (48,37,right,12), always safe.\n\nFreeway 6 is y=6, where player starts.\n\nAt t=10, on freeway 6, car: head=48, tail=37, both >0, span [37,48] at t=10, 37>0, so 0 not in span, so safe at t=10.\n\nAt future times, [37+12ΔT,48+12ΔT], always >0, so freeway 6 always safe.\n\nFreeway 7: (24,-11,right,36), same as freeway 3, head=24, tail=-11, d=right, span at t=10: [-11,24]\n\n0 covered only at T=10, as above.\n\nBut freeway 7 is y=7.\n\nAt T=10, 0 covered, but player at y=6, not affected.\n\nOther times not covered.\n\nFreeway 8: three cars.\n\nCar A: (-24,-35,right,4) head=-24, tail=-35, d=right, span [tail,head] = [-35,-24] at t=10\n\nAt T: [-35 +4ΔT, -24 +4ΔT]\n\n0 in span if -35 +4ΔT <=0 <= -24 +4ΔT\n\nAs earlier, for ΔT=6 to 8.75, T=16,17,18.\n\nSpecifically: T=16: [-35+24, -24+24] = [-11,0], 0 included\n\nT=17: [-35+28, -24+28] = [-7,4], 0 in\n\nT=18: [-35+32, -24+32] = [-3,8], 0 in\n\nT=19: [-35+36, -24+36] = [1,12], 0 not in\n\nCar B: (52,41,right,4) head=52, tail=41, span [41,52] at t=10, at T: [41+4ΔT,52+4ΔT], always >0, never cover 0.\n\nCar C: (16,5,right,4) head=16, tail=5, span [5,16] at t=10, at T: [5+4ΔT,16+4ΔT], min 5>0, always >0, never cover 0.\n\nSo for freeway 8, collision only at T=16,17,18 from car A.\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway when it is unsafe (0 covered):\n\n- Freeway 1: unsafe at T=16,17,18\n\n- Freeway 2: always safe\n\n- Freeway 3: unsafe only at T=10\n\n- Freeway 4: always safe\n\n- Freeway 5: always safe\n\n- Freeway 6: always safe (since min x=37>0)\n\n- Freeway 7: unsafe only at T=10\n\n- Freeway 8: unsafe at T=16,17,18\n\nPlayer starts at t=10, y=6.\n\ny=6 is freeway 6, which is always safe, so at t=10, safe.\n\nNow, we need to go to y=9.\n\ny=9 is not freeway, safe.\n\nThe freeways between are y=7 and y=8.\n\ny=7: freeway 7, unsafe only at T=10, but at T=10, player is at y=6, not y=7.\n\nIf player moves to y=7 at some turn.\n\nSimilarly y=8: freeway 8, unsafe at T=16,17,18.\n\nPlayer can be on y=7 or y=8 at different times.\n\nTo reach y=9 from y=6, min 3 up moves.\n\nBut we can also stay or move down to avoid bad times, but since we want min turns, probably not down, unless necessary.\n\nFirst, try to go directly up.\n\nStart at t=10, y=6.\n\nAction at t=10: if U, then y=7 at t=11.\n\nIf D, y=5 at t=11, but y=5 is freeway 5, always safe, but moving down away from goal, not good.\n\nIf S, y=6 at t=11.\n\nBut to reach y=9, we need to increase y.\n\nSo better to go up.\n\nSuppose at t=10, action U: then at t=11, y=7.\n\nNow at t=11, on freeway 7.\n\nFreeway 7 unsafe only at T=10, which is past, so at t=11, freeway 7 is safe (since only unsafe at t=10).\n\nSimilarly, freeway 7 car: at T=11, ΔT=1, span for freeway 7: car (24,-11,right,36), at T=11, ΔT=1, span [-11+36,24+36] = [25,60], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSo at t=11, y=7, safe.\n\nThen action at t=11: U, to y=8 at t=12.\n\nAt t=12, y=8, on freeway 8.\n\nFreeway 8 unsafe at T=16,17,18.\n\nAt t=12, which is before 16, so safe? At t=12, ΔT=2 from t=10.\n\nFreeway 8 car A: span at T=12, ΔT=2, [-35 +4*2, -24 +4*2] = [-35+8, -24+8] = [-27,-16], both negative, 0 not in.\n\nOther cars not cover 0. So safe.\n\nThen action at t=12: U, to y=9 at t=13.\n\nAt t=13, y=9, not freeway, safe.\n\nSo sequence: t=10: U, to y=7 at t=11\n\nt=11: U, to y=8 at t=12\n\nt=12: U, to y=9 at t=13\n\nH=3 turns, actions at t=10,11,12.\n\nNow, check for each position:\n\nAt t=10: y=6, freeway 6, always safe, ok.\n\nt=11: y=7, freeway 7, at t=11, as above, span [25,60], 0 not in, safe.\n\nt=12: y=8, freeway 8, at t=12, span car A: [-27,-16], 0 not in, safe.\n\nt=13: y=9, safe.\n\nSo it seems we can reach in 3 turns with no problem.\n\nBut is there any issue?\n\nFreeway 8 is unsafe at t=16,17,18, but we are at t=12, which is fine.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways not involved.\n\nBut player needs to be on freeway only when moving through, but in this case, we pass y=7 at t=11, y=8 at t=12, both safe at those times.\n\nPerhaps we can do it faster? But from y=6 to y=9, min 3 moves up, so 3 is minimum possible, and it works.\n\nBut let me confirm freeway 6 at t=10: car on y=6: (48,37,right,12), span at t=10: [37,48], 37>0, 0 not in, safe.\n\nYes.\n\nSo with actions: t=10: U, t=11: U, t=12: U.\n\nBut in the sequence, at t=10, action U, then at t=11, position y=7, etc.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} , etc.\n\nt_1=10.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nAnd after that, at turn 13, y=9.\n\nH=3.\n\nBut is there a reason to wait or something? In this case, no need.\n\nPerhaps at some point it is unsafe, but here it is safe.\n\nAnother thing: when moving, the note says if you move to different y, you are not on that y until next turn, but in this case, at each turn, we are on the y position, and we checked.\n\nFor example, at t=10, we are on y=6, take U, then at t=11, we are on y=7.\n\nAt t=11, on y=7, we take U, at t=12 on y=8, etc.\n\nNo issue.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 7, at t=10 it was unsafe, but we are not there at t=10.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think this works.\n\nBut let me check if at t=12 on freeway 8, it is safe.\n\nFreeway 8 at t=12: cars:\n\nCar A: span [-35 +4*(12-10), -24 +4*(12-10)] = [-35 +8, -24+8] = [-27,-16], 0 not in.\n\nCar B: [41+4*2,52+4*2] = [41+8,52+8]=[49,60]? At t=10 span [41,52], ΔT=2, [41+8,52+8]=[49,60], no.\n\nCar C: [5+4*2,16+4*2]=[5+8,16+8]=[13,24], both >0.\n\nSo no car covers 0, safe.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), which we do at turn 13.\n\nH=3 actions.\n\nBut in the sequence, actions from t=10 to t=12.\n\nt=10,11,12.\n\nNow, but let me see if we can do in less, but impossible since y=6 to y=9, need 3 up moves.\n\nUnless we start at y=6, but after actions, we might reach in fewer, but no, each action changes y by at most 1, so from 6 to 9, min 3 steps.\n\nSo H=3 is minimum.\n\nAnd it works.\n\nBut in the car states, for example freeway 3 and 7 had issue at t=10, but not relevant.\n\nPerhaps for other y, but we don't go there.\n\nSo I think this is fine.\n\nBut the player is at (0,6) at t=10, and we need to output actions.\n\nBut in the answer, it should be the sequence.\n\nBut let me confirm the turn numbering.\n\nt_1 = 10.\n\nActions: a_{10}, a_{11}, a_{12} with U,U,U.\n\nThen at turn t=13, y=9.\n\nThe minimal H is 3.\n\nBut is there a car on freeway 6? Yes, but safe.\n\nPerhaps I should list all freeway safety over time.\n\nSince we only care about the times we might be there.\n\nIn this path, we are on y=6 at t=10, y=7 at t=11, y=8 at t=12.\n\ny=6 at t=10: safe.\n\ny=7 at t=11: safe, as above.\n\ny=8 at t=12: safe.\n\nNo problem.\n\nSuppose we stay or something, but that would take more turns, not minimal.\n\nSo I think this is the way.\n\nBut in the freeway 8, there is a car that will be at 0 at t=16,17,18, but at t=12 it is fine.\n\nSo for the answer.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\"\n\nH=3, sequence U,U,U for t=10,11,12.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let me write the answer.\n\nSo:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\n}\n\nBut in the format, it should be Turn t_1: a_{t_1}, etc.\n\nt_1=10.\n\nSo Turn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nAnd H=3.\n\nBut since it says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\", so for t from 0 to H-1, a_{t_1 + t}\n\nSo for t=0, a_{10}, t=1, a_{11}, t=2, a_{12}.\n\nActions: a_{10}=U, a_{11}=U, a_{12}=U.\n\nThen y_{13}=9.\n\nYes.\n\nI think that's it.\n\nBut just to be thorough, suppose at some point we need to avoid, but here no need.\n\nFor example, if we were to be on y=8 at t=16, it would be bad, but we are at t=12.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo minimal H=3.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 6) at turn \\(t_1 = 10\\) and aims to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis:\n- The minimum number of turns to move from \\(y = 6\\) to \\(y = 9\\) is 3, as each \"U\" action increases \\(y\\) by 1.\n- Collision occurs only if, at turn \\(T\\), the player is on a freeway \\(y_T\\) (where \\(1 \\leq y_T \\leq 8\\)) and the position \\(x = 0\\) is within the span of any car on that freeway at turn \\(T\\).\n- The car spans and their movements were analyzed for all freeways from \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) to determine safe times:\n  - **Freeway 1 (y=1)**: Unsafe at turns 16, 17, 18. Safe at turn 10–15 and after 19.\n  - **Freeway 2 (y=2)**: Always safe.\n  - **Freeway 3 (y=3)**: Unsafe only at turn 10. Safe at all other turns.\n  - **Freeway 4 (y=4)**: Always safe.\n  - **Freeway 5 (y=5)**: Always safe.\n  - **Freeway 6 (y=6)**: Always safe (car span at turn 10 is [37, 48], min > 0, and increases).\n  - **Freeway 7 (y=7)**: Unsafe only at turn 10. Safe at all other turns.\n  - **Freeway 8 (y=8)**: Unsafe at turns 16, 17, 18. Safe at turns 10–15 and after 19.\n\n### Path to Goal:\n- At turn 10, player is at \\(y = 6\\) (freeway 6, always safe).\n- Action \"U\" at turn 10 moves to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 11.\n  - At turn 11, \\(y = 7\\) (freeway 7): Safe (span at turn 11 is [25, 60], 0 not in span).\n- Action \"U\" at turn 11 moves to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 12.\n  - At turn 12, \\(y = 8\\) (freeway 8): Safe (car A span [-27, -16], car B span [49, 60], car C span [13, 24]; 0 not in any span).\n- Action \"U\" at turn 12 moves to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 13.\n  - \\(y = 9\\) is not a freeway, so always safe.\n\nThis sequence reaches \\(y = 9\\) in 3 turns (minimal possible) with no collisions. Staying or moving down would increase \\(H\\), so it is not optimal.\n\n**Minimal \\(H = 3\\)**\n\n**Sequence of actions for turns \\(t_1 = 10\\) to \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 12\\):**\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 10: U \\\\\nTurn 11: U \\\\\nTurn 12: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are starting at turn t1 = 11, at position (0,7). The goal is to reach (0,9) in the minimal number of turns without colliding with cars on the freeways (y=1 to 8). We can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S). Note that the grid for y is from 0 to 9.\n\nImportant: Collision occurs at turn T only if the player is on a freeway y (which is between 1 and 8) at that turn T and if 0 (the x-coordinate of the player) is in the span of any car on that freeway at the same turn T.\n\nAlso note: When moving from y to y' at turn T, the player is considered to be on y at turn T and then on y' at turn T+1. So at the moment of the move (turn T), the player is still on the current row and will be on the next row at the next turn.\n\nWe are given the state of the cars at turn t1=11. For each car, we have (head, tail, direction, speed). Note the representation:\n\n- For a right-moving car: the span is [tail, head] (with tail < head) and at time t1 it's [tau, h]. Then at time T (>= t1), the car moves to [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n- For a left-moving car: the span is [head, tail] (with head > tail) and at time t1 it's [h, tau]. Then at time T, the car moves to [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)].\n\nWe must avoid being on a freeway row (y from 1 to 8) at a turn T when 0 is in the span of any car on that row at that same turn T.\n\nOur plan: We are at y=7 at turn 11. We need to get to y=9. We can only move one step at a time. The minimal moves in terms of vertical steps: from 7 to 9 we need at least 2 moves (two ups). However, we must avoid the freeways at the turns we are on them. Note that we are starting at y=7 (freeway row) at turn 11, so we must check that at turn 11 we are safe at y=7. Similarly, when we move to y=8 at turn 12, we must be safe at y=8 at turn 12, and then at turn 13 we move to y=9 (which is not a freeway) so we don't check for cars at y=9.\n\nBut note: the goal is to be at (0,9) at the last turn. The moment we are at (0,9) we are done. Also note that when we are at y=9, we are safe because freeways are only from y=1 to y=8.\n\nHowever, we must also consider that we might have to wait (use S) to avoid collisions.\n\nLet me write down the cars at each freeway at turn 11:\n\nFreeway 1 (y=1):\n  Car1: (-20, -31, right, 4) -> This car is moving right. So at turn 11: [tau, h] = [-31, -20]? \n  But note: the representation says (head, tail, direction, speed). For right-moving, the head is the front (larger x) and tail is the back (smaller x). So the span is [tail, head] = [-31, -20] at turn 11.\n\n  Actually, the problem says: for right-moving: [tau, h] -> so the tail is the first number and head the second? But the input is given as (head, tail, ...). So in the input for a right-moving car, the head is the larger number and tail the smaller? \n\n  Let me check the example: \n      (head, tail, direction, speed) = (-20, -31, right, 4)\n  Since the car is moving right, the tail should be the leftmost (smaller x) and head the rightmost (larger x). But here head=-20 and tail=-31, which is consistent because -20 > -31.\n\n  So the span at turn 11 is [tail, head] = [-31, -20].\n\n  Similarly, the second car on freeway 1: (44,33,right,4) -> but note 44>33, so span is [33,44].\n\nFreeway 2: (-72,-49,left,24) -> left moving: the head is the front (which is at the left, so larger x) and tail at the right? Actually, for left-moving, the representation in the input is (head, tail) and then the update: [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]. Also note the initial span is [head, tail]? But the problem says for left-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, tau]\". So at turn 11, the car is at [h, tau] = [-72, -49]? However, for a left-moving car, the head should be the front (which is the larger x) and tail the back (smaller x). But here head=-72 and tail=-49, which is inconsistent because -72 < -49. \n\nWait, let me re-read the problem: \n  For a left-moving car: \"Span(t1) = [h, tau]\" and then update: [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]. \n\nBut in the input for freeway 2: (-72, -49, left, 24). If we take h=-72 and tau=-49, then the span at turn 11 is [-72, -49]. However, note that for a left-moving car, the head (front) should be at a larger x than the tail? But here -49 is larger than -72. So it seems the input might be giving the head and tail in the order that for a left-moving car, the head is the leftmost (larger x) and tail the rightmost (smaller x). But in this case, the car is moving left, so the head (front) should be at a larger x? Actually, when the car moves left, the front (head) is at a larger x and the tail at a smaller x. But in the input, we have head=-72 and tail=-49, which would imply the head is at -72 and the tail at -49, meaning the head is at a smaller x? That doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, the problem states the car as (head, tail, direction, speed). So regardless of direction, the head is the front of the car and tail the back. For a right-moving car, the head is at a larger x than the tail. For a left-moving car, the head is at a larger x than the tail? Because when moving left, the front is at the left (larger x) and the back at the right (smaller x) as it moves left? Actually, no: if a car is moving left, then its front (head) is the leftmost part? Then as it moves left, the x-coordinate of the front decreases. \n\nBut in the input for freeway 2: head=-72, tail=-49. Since the car is moving left, the head (front) should be at a larger x than the tail? But -49 is larger than -72. So the head should be -49 and the tail -72? \n\nI think there is a confusion. Let me look at the update rules:\n\nFor left-moving: the update is [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]. The problem says: \"Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, tau]\". \n\nBut if the car is moving left, the entire car shifts to the left (decreasing x). So the head (which is the front) is at h and the tail at tau. And we must have h > tau (because the head is to the right of the tail? Then when moving left, the head moves to h - s*(T-t1) and the tail to tau - s*(T-t1). \n\nBut in the input, for freeway 2: (-72, -49, left, 24). If we interpret h=-72 and tau=-49, then h < tau. That would imply the head is to the left of the tail? That doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might have given the head and tail regardless of order? But note: the update rule for left-moving uses [h, tau] and then subtracts s*(T-t1). So the initial span is [h, tau] and then it moves left by subtracting. \n\nBut if h=-72 and tau=-49, then the initial span is [-72, -49]. As time passes, the car moves left: so at time T, the span becomes [-72 -24*(T-11), -49 -24*(T-11)]. \n\nHowever, the problem says for left-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, tau]\" and then becomes [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]. So the span at t1 is [h, tau]. But if h < tau, then the span [h, tau] would be from a lower x to a higher x? But that would be the same as a right-moving car? \n\nI think the problem intends that for a left-moving car, the head is the rightmost point (the front when moving left) and the tail is the leftmost? That doesn't make sense because when moving left, the front is the leftmost? \n\nWait, let me think: When a car moves left, its front (head) is the part that is leading to the left. So at time t1, the head is at position h, and the tail is at position tau, and we must have h > tau (because the head is at a larger x than the tail? But as the car moves left, both decrease, and the head remains at the front (so at a larger x than the tail). Actually, no: if the car is moving left, then the head (front) is at the leftmost part? Then the head should be at a smaller x than the tail? \n\nExample: \n  A car moving left: at time t1, the head (front) is at x=10, and the tail (back) is at x=20? Then the car spans from 10 to 20? But then if it moves left by 1 unit, the head becomes 9 and the tail 19. But that would be a car that is oriented from 9 to 19? Then the front (head) is at 9 and the tail at 19? Then the head is at a smaller x. \n\nSo in this case, for a left-moving car, the head is at the leftmost (smaller x) and the tail at the rightmost (larger x). \n\nBut the problem says: for left-moving, the span is [h, tau]. If h is the head (leftmost) and tau is the tail (rightmost), then we have h < tau. Then the span [h, tau] is from h to tau, which is increasing. \n\nSimilarly, for right-moving: the head is at the rightmost (larger x) and tail at the leftmost (smaller x). So the span [tau, h] is increasing from tau to h.\n\nTherefore, in the input:\n\nFor freeway 2: (head, tail, direction, speed) = (-72, -49, left, 24) \n  -> head = -72, tail = -49, and since it's left-moving, the head is the leftmost and tail the rightmost. So the car spans from -72 to -49. \n\nBut note: the problem says for left-moving the initial span is [h, tau] = [-72, -49]. Then at time T, it becomes [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)] = [-72 -24*(T-11), -49 -24*(T-11)].\n\nSimilarly, for a right-moving car, the initial span is [tau, head] = [tail, head] (with tail < head). \n\nSo let's list all cars at turn 11:\n\nFreeway 1 (y=1):\n  Car1: (head=-20, tail=-31, right, 4) -> tail=-31, head=-20 -> so span at t1: [-31, -20]\n  Car2: (head=44, tail=33, right, 4) -> tail=33, head=44 -> span at t1: [33,44]\n\nFreeway 2 (y=2):\n  Car1: (head=-72, tail=-49, left, 24) -> left-moving: span at t1: [-72, -49]\n\nFreeway 3 (y=3):\n  Car1: (head=60, tail=25, right, 36) -> tail=25, head=60 -> span: [25,60]\n\nFreeway 4 (y=4):\n  Car1: (head=60, tail=49, right, 12) -> tail=49, head=60 -> [49,60]\n\nFreeway 5 (y=5): same as 4? \n  Car1: (head=60, tail=49, right, 12) -> [49,60]\n\nFreeway 6 (y=6): same as 4 -> [49,60]\n\nFreeway 7 (y=7): \n  Car1: (head=60, tail=25, right, 36) -> [25,60]\n\nFreeway 8 (y=8):\n  Car1: (head=-20, tail=-31, right, 4) -> [-31, -20]\n  Car2: (head=56, tail=45, right, 4) -> [45,56]\n  Car3: (head=20, tail=9, right, 4) -> [9,20]\n\nWe are at turn 11, at y=7. We must check if we are safe at turn 11 at y=7.\n\nAt turn 11, on freeway 7: there is one car: [25,60]. Is 0 in [25,60]? No. So safe.\n\nNow, we want to move to y=8 and then to y=9. The minimal moves: \n  Turn 11: we are at y=7. \n  Turn 12: we move to y=8 -> then we must be safe at turn 12 at y=8.\n  Turn 13: we move to y=9 -> then we are at the goal.\n\nBut we must check the car on freeway 8 at turn 12.\n\nFreeway 8 at turn 12 (T=12, so T-t1=1):\n\nFor each car on freeway 8 (which are right-moving, so they move to the right by s*(T-t1)=4*1=4):\n\n  Car1: initially at turn11: [-31, -20] -> at turn12: [-31+4, -20+4] = [-27, -16]\n  Car2: [45,56] -> [45+4,56+4] = [49,60]\n  Car3: [9,20] -> [13,24]\n\nAt turn12, we are at y=8. We must check if 0 is in any of these spans? \n  [-27,-16]: 0 is not in this interval (negative numbers).\n  [49,60]: no\n  [13,24]: no\n\nSo at turn12, freeway8 is safe.\n\nThen at turn13, we move to y=9 and we are done.\n\nSo the sequence would be:\n  Turn11: U (to go from y=7 to y=8 at turn12)\n  Turn12: U (to go from y=8 to y=9 at turn13)\n\nBut note: at turn11, we are at y=7. We take action U at turn11: then at turn12 we are at y=8. Then at turn12 we take action U: then at turn13 we are at y=9.\n\nHowever, we must also check if we are safe at turn11: we already did (freeway7: [25,60] does not contain 0) -> safe.\n\nAnd at turn12: freeway8 is safe as above.\n\nSo the minimal H is 2? \n\nBut wait: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\" and the sequence of actions from t1 to t1+H-1. So H=2: we take two actions: one at turn11 and one at turn12.\n\nBut let me double-check the update: \n  Turn11: we are at y=7. We do U -> then at the next turn (turn12) we are at y=8.\n  Turn12: we are at y=8. We do U -> then at turn13 we are at y=9.\n\nSo at turn13 we have reached y=9.\n\nBut note: we are required to output the actions for turns t1, t1+1, ... until the last action at turn t1+H-1. And H is the number of turns? Actually, the player update is defined for each turn: at turn t, we choose a_t, and then we get y_{t+1}. So we start at turn t1 at position y_{t1}=7. Then we take H-1 actions? Or H actions? \n\nThe problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" such that after H turns (i.e., from t1 to t1+H-1) we end at y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nBut note: the state at turn t1 is given. Then we take action at turn t1, then turn t1+1, ... until turn t1+H-1. Then the position at turn t1+H is y_{t1+H} = ... but we are required to have reached (0,9) at turn t1+H-1? \n\nActually, the problem says: \"such that y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9\". \n\nSo at the end of the sequence of H actions (which are taken at turns t1, t1+1, ... t1+H-1), the position at turn t1+H-1 is 9.\n\nHow does that work? \n  At turn t1, we start at y_{t1}=7.\n  After taking action at turn t1, we get y_{t1+1}.\n  ...\n  After taking the last action at turn t1+H-1, we get y_{t1+H} = ??? \n\nBut note: the problem says the sequence is for t from 0 to H-1: \n  t=0: action at t1 -> then y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + Delta\n  t=1: action at t1+1 -> then y_{t1+2}\n  ...\n  t=H-1: action at t1+H-1 -> then y_{t1+H}\n\nSo we require that at turn t1+H-1 we are at 9? That doesn't match because the action at t1+H-1 would update to y_{t1+H}. \n\nAlternatively, the problem might mean that we have taken H actions and then at the turn after the last action we are at 9? But the problem says: \"y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9\".\n\nLet me read carefully: \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions ... to reach (0,9)\".\n\nAnd the update: at turn t, we take action a_t and then the position at turn t+1 is updated.\n\nSo at turn t1, we are at (0,7). We take an action at turn t1, which leads to turn t1+1 and position y_{t1+1}. We want that at some turn T we are at (0,9). The problem says: at turn t1+H-1 we are at 9.\n\nBut if we are at 9 at turn t1+H-1, that means we reached 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1? And then we take an action at turn t1+H-1? But that action might move us away? \n\nAlternatively, the problem might mean that we are at 9 at the end of the sequence, meaning after the last action we are at 9. \n\nBut the last action is taken at turn t1+H-1 and then we get y_{t1+H} at turn t1+H. So to have y_{t1+H} = 9, then we would require that at turn t1+H we are at 9. Then the condition would be y_{t1+H}=9. But the problem says y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nLooking back: \"such that y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9\". \n\nSo we are required to be at 9 at turn t1+H-1. That means that we are at 9 at the beginning of the turn t1+H-1? Then we take an action at that turn? But that action would then change y to 8,9, or 10? \n\nThis is confusing. \n\nBut note: the player update: \n  y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t.\n\nSo the position at turn t is y_t. Then we take action a_t at turn t, which determines y_{t+1}. \n\nWe start at turn t1: y_{t1} = 7. \nWe take action a_{t1} at turn t1, then we get y_{t1+1}.\nWe take action a_{t1+1} at turn t1+1, then we get y_{t1+2}.\n...\nWe take action a_{t1+H-1} at turn t1+H-1, then we get y_{t1+H}.\n\nBut we require y_{t1+H-1} = 9? That means that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 we are at 9. Then we take an action a_{t1+H-1} which will change the position to 8,9, or 10? But we want to be at 9 at the end? \n\nAlternatively, the problem might mean that we are at 9 at the end of the sequence, i.e., after taking the last action, we are at 9. But that would be at turn t1+H. \n\nBut the problem says: \"y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9\". \n\nI think there is a misunderstanding. Let me check the problem statement: \n  \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0, 9)\"\n\nand then: \"such that y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nBut note: the sequence of actions is taken at turns: t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1. Then the state after the last action is at turn t1+H. \n\nBut the problem says we must have y_{t1+H-1} = 9. \n\nThis implies that we are at 9 at the beginning of the turn t1+H-1, and then we take an action at that turn? Why would we take an action if we are already at 9? \n\nUnless the minimal H is defined as the number of turns from the start until we are at 9, and then we stop. But the sequence of actions includes the actions until we are at 9? \n\nAlternatively, the problem might mean that we are at 9 at the end of the last action? But then it would be y_{t1+H}=9.\n\nLooking at the example in the problem: \n  \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\"\n\nand the goal is to reach (0,9). \n\nIn the update rule, the position at the next turn is determined by the current action. \n\nI think the intended meaning is that we want to be at (0,9) at the end of the entire sequence, i.e., at turn t1+H. Then H is the number of turns we take actions? But then the condition should be y_{t1+H}=9.\n\nBut the problem explicitly says: y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the counting is: \n  At turn t1 (the current turn), we are at (0,7). Then we take an action at turn t1, and then at turn t1+1 we are at a new position. \n  We want to be at (0,9) at some turn T. \n\nThe problem says: the sequence of actions is for t=0 to H-1: meaning we take H actions: at t1, t1+1, ... t1+H-1. Then the position at turn t1+H is the result of the last action. \n\nBut then we require y_{t1+H}=9. \n\nBut the problem states: y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nI see the confusion. The problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\". And then the sequence is for turns t1 to t1+H-1. \n\nIn the problem, the term \"turns\" might refer to the time steps at which we are at a position? \n\nAt turn t1, we are at (0,7). Then after taking an action at turn t1, we move to turn t1+1. \n\nSo to be at (0,9) at turn T, we need to take actions from turn t1 to turn T-1. Then the number of actions is T - t1. \n\nBut the problem says: the minimal number of turns H. And then the sequence is from t1 to t1+H-1. \n\nIf H is the number of turns (including the starting turn?) then the starting turn is turn t1, then the next turn is t1+1, and so on until turn t1+H-1? \n\nBut then the position at turn t1+H-1 would be after taking H-1 actions? \n\nThe problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" -> so the actions are taken at t1+0, t1+1, ... t1+H-1: that's H actions. \n\nAnd then we require that at turn t1+H-1, we are at 9. \n\nBut note: the position at turn t is y_t. \n\nAt turn t1 (before any action in the sequence), we are at y_{t1}=7. \nAfter taking action a_{t1} at turn t1, we get y_{t1+1}.\nAfter taking action a_{t1+1} at turn t1+1, we get y_{t1+2}.\n...\nAfter taking action a_{t1+H-1} at turn t1+H-1, we get y_{t1+H}.\n\nBut we require y_{t1+H-1}=9. \n\nThis would mean that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at 9. Then we take an action a_{t1+H-1} which will update the position to y_{t1+H} which is either 8,9,10. \n\nBut we want to be at 9 at the end? \n\nUnless the action at turn t1+H-1 is S (stay), then we remain at 9. Then at turn t1+H we are still at 9. But the requirement is for turn t1+H-1 to be 9.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might mean that we are at 9 at the turn when we finish the last action, i.e., at turn t1+H-1 we take an action and then become at 9? That would be y_{t1+H}=9. \n\nI think there is a discrepancy. \n\nLooking at the answer format: \n  Turn t1: a_t1\n  Turn t1+1: a_{t1+1}\n  ...\n\nSo if we are to output two actions (for H=2), then we output:\n  Turn 11: U\n  Turn 12: U\n\nThen at turn11 we do U -> at turn12 we are at y=8.\nAt turn12 we do U -> at turn13 we are at y=9.\n\nBut then we are at y=9 at turn13, which is t1+2 = 13. \n\nThe problem requires y_{t1+H-1}=9. With H=2, that would be y_{11+2-1}=y_{12}=8, which is not 9. \n\nSo H=2 does not satisfy y_{12}=9. \n\nTherefore, we must have y_{t1+H-1}=9. \n\nSo we require that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at 9. \n\nThat means we must have reached 9 at the end of the previous action, i.e., at turn t1+H-2 we took an action that brought us to 9 at turn t1+H-1. \n\nThen at turn t1+H-1, we are at 9 and we take an action (which might be S to stay, or even move away). But the problem doesn't require that we stay at 9? It only requires that at turn t1+H-1 we are at 9. \n\nBut note: the goal is to reach (0,9). So if we are at 9 at turn t1+H-1, then we have reached. But then why take an action at that turn? \n\nThe problem says: the sequence of actions is for turns t1 to t1+H-1. So if we are at 9 at turn t1+H-1, then we don't need to move? We can take an action at turn t1+H-1 that keeps us at 9 (i.e., S) or even moves away? But moving away would be bad. \n\nSo to stay at 9, we must take action S at turn t1+H-1.\n\nBut then the minimal H: we must count the turn at which we are at 9 and then take an action to stay? \n\nAlternatively, we might reach 9 at turn t1+H-1 without the last action? \n\nExample: \n  We want to be at 9 at turn T = t1+H-1.\n  Then we must have arrived at 9 at the beginning of turn T. \n  How did we arrive? By an action taken at turn T-1. \n\nSo the last action that moved us to 9 is at turn T-1 = t1+H-2. \n\nThen at turn T = t1+H-1, we are at 9. Then we must take an action at turn T? But the problem requires a sequence of actions until turn t1+H-1. \n\nSo to have y_{t1+H-1}=9, we must have been moved to 9 by an action taken at turn t1+H-2, and then at turn t1+H-1 we are at 9 and we take an action (which should be S to remain, or we could take U or D? But if we take U we go to 10, which is invalid? because y must be in [0,9]. Similarly D would go to 8. \n\nBut we only care that at turn t1+H-1 we are at 9. The action taken at that turn might change it, but the condition is only on the state at the beginning of the turn.\n\nHowever, the goal is to reach (0,9) and we are there at the beginning of turn t1+H-1. \n\nBut then why take the action at turn t1+H-1? \n\nThe problem requires a sequence of actions for turns t1 to t1+H-1. So if we are at 9 at turn t1+H-1, then we must include an action at that turn. \n\nAnd to remain at 9, we choose S.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H: we need to arrive at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1. \n\nThe earliest we can be at 9 is at the beginning of turn t1+2: \n  Turn t1 (11): we start at y=7. \n  Turn t1+1 (12): we are at y=8 (if we took U at turn11) \n  Turn t1+2 (13): we are at y=9 (if we took U at turn12) \n\nSo at the beginning of turn13 (which is t1+2), we are at 9. \n\nThen we set H such that t1+H-1 = 13 -> 11+H-1=13 -> H=3.\n\nSo we need 3 turns: actions at turn11, turn12, and turn13.\n\nThe actions:\n  Turn11: U -> moves from 7 to 8 at turn12.\n  Turn12: U -> moves from 8 to 9 at turn13.\n  Turn13: S -> to remain at 9? But note, at turn13 we are already at 9 at the beginning. We take action S to remain at 9 for the next state? But the requirement is only that at turn13 (t1+H-1=13) we are at 9. And we are at the beginning. Then taking action S at turn13 will leave us at 9 at turn14, but we don't care about turn14.\n\nBut the problem says: we require y_{t1+H-1}=9. At the beginning of turn13, we are at 9. So condition satisfied.\n\nHowever, note that we must avoid collisions on freeways during the entire sequence. At turn13, we are at y=9, which is not a freeway, so no collision check.\n\nBut we must check the turns when we are on freeways: \n  Turn11: we are at y=7 (freeway) -> we checked: safe.\n  Turn12: we are at y=8 (freeway) -> we checked: safe.\n\nThen at turn13: we are at y=9 -> not a freeway.\n\nSo the sequence would be:\n  Turn11: U\n  Turn12: U\n  Turn13: S   (to satisfy that we take an action at turn13, and we remain at 9)\n\nBut is S necessary? The problem says the sequence must be for turns t1 to t1+H-1, and H=3, so we need actions at turn11,12,13.\n\nAlternatively, could we do without the last S? \n\nBut the problem requires that at turn t1+H-1 we are at 9. With H=3, we require at turn13 we are at 9. And we are. Then the last action at turn13 is S to stay.\n\nBut note: the action at turn13 doesn't change our position, and we are already at 9 at the beginning of turn13, so it's redundant? However, the problem requires a sequence of H actions. \n\nIs there a way to be at 9 at turn12? \n\nAt turn11: we start at y=7. To be at y=9 at the beginning of turn12, we would have to move up by 2 in one turn? But we can only move by +1, -1, or 0 per turn. So impossible. \n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 3.\n\nBut wait, what if we do:\n  Turn11: S (stay at 7)\n  Turn12: U (to 8)\n  Turn13: U (to 9)\n\nThen at turn13 we are at 9? But then we would have to take an action at turn13 to have the sequence of 3 actions? But then we are at 9 at the beginning of turn13? \n\nActually, at the beginning of turn11: y11=7.\nAfter action at turn11 (S): y12=7.\nAfter action at turn12 (U): y13=8.\nAfter action at turn13 (U): y14=9.\n\nThen at the beginning of turn13, we are at 8, not 9. So to be at 9 at the beginning of turn13, we would need to have taken two U's by turn12: which is impossible.\n\nTherefore, the earliest we can be at 9 is at the beginning of turn13.\n\nSo H must be 3.\n\nBut then our initial plan of two actions (without the last S) would not satisfy because the problem requires that at turn t1+H-1 we are at 9, and with H=2, that turn is turn12 (11+2-1=12) and at turn12 we are at 8, not 9.\n\nTherefore, we must have H=3.\n\nSo the actions are:\n  Turn11: U\n  Turn12: U\n  Turn13: S\n\nBut note: at turn13, we are at y=9. Taking S is safe and keeps us at 9.\n\nBut is there a shorter sequence? We see that we cannot be at 9 earlier than turn13.\n\nAlternatively, could we reach 9 by going down? \n  From 7: down to 6, then up to 7, then up to 8, then up to 9? That would take more turns.\n\nSo minimal H is 3.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: S\n\nBut let me double-check the collisions for the entire journey:\n\nAt turn11 (t=11): we are at y=7. Cars on freeway7: only one car: [25,60] -> 0 not in [25,60] -> safe.\n\nAt turn12 (t=12): we are at y=8. Cars on freeway8:\n  Car1: updated from turn11: [-31,-20] at turn11, so at turn12 (T=12): \n        right-moving: new tail = -31 + 4*(12-11) = -27, new head = -20+4 = -16 -> [-27,-16] -> 0 not in there.\n  Car2: [45,56] -> [45+4,56+4] = [49,60] -> 0 not in.\n  Car3: [9,20] -> [13,24] -> 0 not in.\n  Safe.\n\nAt turn13: we are at y=9 -> no freeway, safe.\n\nSo the sequence is valid.\n\nBut wait: the problem says that when we move, at the turn we are still on the current row. So at turn12, we moved from y=7 to y=8? Actually, no: \n  At turn11, we are at y=7. We take U -> then at turn12 we are at y=8.\n  At turn12, we are at y=8. We take U -> then at turn13 we are at y=9.\n  Then at turn13, we take S -> then at turn14 we are at y=9.\n\nBut the requirement is that at turn13 (t1+H-1 = 11+3-1=13) we are at 9. And at the beginning of turn13, we are at 9. Then we take S and remain at 9 for turn14, but that is beyond.\n\nSo it meets the requirement.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: S\n}\n\nBut note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\". We have H=3.\n\nHowever, let me see if we can avoid the last S? \n\nBut the problem requires a sequence of H actions, and H=3, so we need three actions. The last action is necessary to complete the sequence.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem allows that we stop after reaching 9, then we might only take two actions? But the problem states that we must output the sequence for the entire H turns.\n\nSo we output three actions.\n\nBut wait, what if we define H=2? Then we would be required to be at 9 at turn11+2-1=12. But at turn12 we are at 8, not 9. So H=2 is not valid.\n\nTherefore, we must have H=3.\n\nOne more thing: what if we take a different sequence? \n  Turn11: U -> to 8 at turn12.\n  Turn12: S -> stay at 8 at turn13.\n  Then we are at 8 at turn13, not 9.\n\nThen we would need another move: \n  Turn13: U -> to 9 at turn14.\n\nThen at turn14 we are at 9. Then we would need H=4: \n  We require y_{11+4-1}=y_{14}=9? \n  Then actions: turn11: U, turn12: S, turn13: U, turn14: S? \n\nThat's more than 3.\n\nSo the minimal H is 3.\n\nFinal answer.\n</think>\nThe goal is to reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 7) at turn \\(t_1 = 11\\) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\), avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\). Collision occurs only if the player is on a freeway row \\(y\\) at turn \\(T\\) and the x-coordinate 0 is within the span of any car on that row at the same turn.\n\n### Analysis:\n- **Initial Position**: At turn 11, the player is at (0, 7).\n- **Goal**: Reach (0, 9) as quickly as possible.\n- **Movement Constraints**: Each action \\(a_t \\in \\{U, D, S\\}\\) changes the y-coordinate by +1 (U), -1 (D), or 0 (S), with y clamped to [0, 9].\n- **Minimal Path**: The direct path requires moving up twice (from y=7 to y=8, then to y=9). This takes at least 2 moves, but the sequence must end with the player at y=9 at turn \\(t_1 + H - 1\\). The earliest this can occur is turn 13 (since moving from y=7 to y=9 in one turn is impossible). Thus, \\(H = 3\\):\n  - Turn 11: Move U to y=8 at turn 12.\n  - Turn 12: Move U to y=9 at turn 13.\n  - Turn 13: Must be at y=9 (beginning of turn), so action S keeps y=9 for turn 14 (but turn 14 is beyond the required turn 13).\n\n### Collision Avoidance:\n- **Turn 11 (y=7)**: Cars on freeway 7 are at [25, 60] (right-moving, speed 36). At turn 11, the span is [25, 60]. 0 is not in [25, 60], so safe.\n- **Turn 12 (y=8)**: Cars on freeway 8:\n  - Car 1: Right-moving, initial span [-31, -20] (speed 4). At turn 12 (offset 1): [-31 + 4, -20 + 4] = [-27, -16]. 0 not in [-27, -16].\n  - Car 2: Right-moving, initial span [45, 56] → [49, 60]. 0 not in [49, 60].\n  - Car 3: Right-moving, initial span [9, 20] → [13, 24]. 0 not in [13, 24].\n  Safe.\n- **Turn 13 (y=9)**: Not a freeway row (y=9 is not in 1–8), so no collision check.\n\n### Sequence:\n- **Turn 11**: Action U (moves to y=8 at turn 12).\n- **Turn 12**: Action U (moves to y=9 at turn 13).\n- **Turn 13**: Action S (stays at y=9 for turn 14; required to be at y=9 at turn 13, which is satisfied).\n\nThis sequence achieves y=9 at turn 13 (\\(t_1 + H - 1 = 11 + 3 - 1 = 13\\)) with \\(H = 3\\), the minimal turns.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 11: U \\\\\nTurn 12: U \\\\\nTurn 13: S\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 12, and the player is at (0,8). The goal is to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nNote: The player moves vertically (U: up, D: down, S: stay) and is at x=0 always. The cars move horizontally on their freeway (y=k for k=1..8). Collision occurs at turn T if the player is at freeway y_T and at that turn, the car on that freeway has a span that includes x=0.\n\nImportant: The player is considered to be on freeway y_t at turn t. When moving (U or D), at turn t, the player is at y_t. Then at turn t+1, they move to y_{t+1}. So, during turn t, they are on freeway y_t. Therefore, they must avoid cars on freeway y_t at turn t.\n\nWe start at turn 12 at y=8. We need to get to y=9. Since we are at y=8, we can try to go up immediately? But we must check the cars on freeway 8 at turn 12 and also on any freeway we might step on in the future.\n\nHowever, note that the goal is (0,9). So we need to be at y=9 at some turn T. Since we are at y=8 at turn 12, if we move up at turn 12, then at turn 13 we would be at y=9. But we must check:\n\n1. At turn 12: we are at y=8. We must check freeway 8 at turn 12: is there a car on freeway 8 such that 0 is in its span at turn 12?\n2. At turn 13: we are at y=9. But note that freeways 1-8 are the ones with cars. y=9 is the goal and has no cars? The problem says \"avoid collisions with cars on freeways y=1,...,8\". So once we are at y=9, we are safe.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H might be 1: if we can go from y=8 to y=9 in one move (at turn 12, action U) and we don't collide at turn 12 (on freeway 8) and at turn 13 we are at y=9 (no car check needed for y=9).\n\nBut we must check the cars on freeway 8 at turn 12.\n\nGiven for freeway 8 at turn 12: \n  cars: (-16, -27, right, 4), (60, 49, right, 4), (24, 13, right, 4)\n\nNote: The representation for a car is (head, tail, direction, speed). For right-moving cars, the span at time t is [tau + s*(t-t0), h + s*(t-t0)]? But note the update:\n\nFor right-moving: initially at t1 (which is 12) the car is [tau, h] meaning the tail is at tau and head at h? But the update rule says:\n  Right-moving: Span(t1) = [tau, h] -> at T: [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nSo at turn 12 (current turn), we have:\n\nCar1: tail = -27, head = -16, direction=right, speed=4 -> span at turn12: [-27, -16]? But note the update rule says for right-moving: [tau, h] -> so the span is from tau to h? Then at turn12: [-27, -16] -> does 0 lie in [-27,-16]? No, because -16 is less than 0? Actually, -27 to -16 is entirely negative. So 0 is not in the interval.\n\nBut wait: the update rule says: for right-moving: at time t1: [tau, h] and then at time T: [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n\nAt T=12 (so T-t1=0), the span is [tau, h] = [-27, -16] for the first car? But the given car is (-16, -27, right, 4). The head is -16 and tail is -27? That would imply the car is from -27 to -16? But typically the head is the front. For a right-moving car, the head should be at the rightmost, so if the car is moving right, then head should be greater than tail? But here: head=-16, tail=-27 -> then the car spans from -27 to -16? Then head is -16 (which is greater than -27) so that makes sense.\n\nSo car1: [-27, -16] at turn12 -> 0 is not in this interval.\n\nCar2: (60,49,right,4). This is problematic because 60>49, but for a right-moving car, the head should be at the right, so head should be greater than tail. But here head=60 and tail=49? Then the car is from 49 to 60? So at turn12: [49,60] -> 0 is not in [49,60].\n\nBut wait, the representation in the table is: (head, tail, ...). So for the second car: head=60, tail=49 -> so the car spans from 49 to 60? Then 0 is not in [49,60].\n\nCar3: (24,13,right,4) -> head=24, tail=13 -> span [13,24] -> 0 is not in [13,24].\n\nSo at turn12, freeway8 has no car at x=0. Therefore, we can be at y=8 at turn12 safely.\n\nNow, if we take action U at turn12, then at turn13 we are at y=9 and we are done.\n\nBut wait: what about the movement? When we are at turn12, we are at y=8. Then we take action U: so we move to y=9 at turn13. However, during turn12, we are on freeway8 and we already checked that at turn12, freeway8 is safe.\n\nAt turn13, we are at y=9 and the goal is reached. There are no cars on y=9 (since freeways are 1-8) so we are safe.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 1 (one action) and the sequence is:\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nBut note: the sequence is for turns starting at t1=12 and going for H turns. We take one action (at turn12) and then at the next turn (turn13) we are at the goal. So H=1.\n\nBut let me double-check: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\". So H is the number of actions? And we start at t1 (which is turn12) and we take actions at turns: t1, t1+1, ... t1+H-1.\n\nAfter H actions, we are at turn t1+H. And we require that at turn t1+H-1? Let me read:\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions ... to reach (0,9)\"\n\nBut the condition is: \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\nWait, the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning we take actions at t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1. Then at the end of these actions, the player is at turn t1+H. But the condition is that we reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1? \n\nActually, the problem says: \"such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\nSo we have:\n- Start at turn t1: we are at (0, y_{t1}) = (0,8).\n- We take an action at turn t1 (which is the first action) and that moves us to turn t1+1 with y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + Delta.\n- We want that at turn t1+H-1, we are at y=9.\n\nBut note: the actions are taken from t1 to t1+H-1, so the last action is taken at turn t1+H-1, which leads to the state at turn t1+H. But we require the position at turn t1+H-1 to be (0,9). \n\nThat seems inconsistent. Let me read the problem again:\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nand then the condition is \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\".\n\nSo after H actions (taken at turns t1, t1+1, ... t1+H-1) we are at turn t1+H. But the requirement is that at turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9). That means that the last action (taken at turn t1+H-1) must have already put us at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1? \n\nBut note: the state at turn t is the state after the action at turn t-1? Actually, the update rule is:\n\nAt turn t, we are at position (0, y_t). Then we choose an action a_t, and then we update to y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t.\n\nSo at turn t, we are at y_t, and we take action a_t which affects the next turn.\n\nTherefore, to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1, we must have taken actions at turns t1, t1+1, ... t1+H-2? \n\nBut the problem states the sequence for t from 0 to H-1: that is, actions at t1+0, t1+1, ... t1+H-1. And we require y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nSo for H=1: \n  We take action at turn t1 (which is 12) -> then at turn t1+1 = 13, we have y_{13} = y_{12} + Delta = 8 + 1 (if U) = 9.\n  But we require y_{t1+H-1} = y_{12+1-1}=y_{12}=8, not 9.\n\nSo that does not satisfy.\n\nTherefore, we must have H such that the position at turn t1+H-1 is 9.\n\nAt turn t1 (12), we are at 8. We need to be at 9 at turn t1+H-1.\n\nThe minimal H: \n  If H=1, then we require at turn t1+H-1 = 12, we are at 9 -> but we are at 8, so no.\n  If H=2: then we require at turn t1+2-1 = 13, we are at 9.\n\nSo we need to get to 9 at turn 13. How? We can do:\n\n  Turn12: action U -> then at turn13, we are at 9.\n\nBut we must avoid collisions at every turn from 12 to 12 (because we are at turn12 and then turn13? But at turn13 we are at y=9, which is safe). However, at turn12 we are at y=8 and we must check freeway8 at turn12 (which we did: safe). Then at turn13 we are at y=9 (safe).\n\nSo the sequence for H=2 would be:\n  Turn12: U\n  Turn13: ? -> but we only need H=2 actions? Actually, the sequence has H actions: from t=0 to H-1, so two actions: at turn12 and turn13? But we only need to get to 9 at turn13 (which is the state after the first action). \n\nBut note: the requirement is that at turn t1+H-1 = 12+2-1 = 13, we are at 9. And we have taken actions at turn12 and turn13? But we only need to take one action (at turn12) to get to 9 at turn13. The second action at turn13 is unnecessary? \n\nBut the problem says: the sequence is for t=0 to H-1, meaning we take H actions. However, after the first action (at turn12) we are already at 9 at turn13. Then the second action (at turn13) might be anything? But we don't need to move again? \n\nBut the problem says: we must reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1. If we are at 9 at turn13, then we are done. However, the sequence must have H actions? So for H=2, we must specify two actions. The second action (at turn13) can be S (stay) or even U or D? But if we are at 9 and we go up, we cannot because y is bounded by 9? Actually, the update rule: y_{t+1} must be in [0,9]. So if we are at 9 and do U, it stays at 9? Or does it? The rule says: \n  y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta, and then we require y_{t+1} in [0,9]. \n  So if at turn13 we are at 9 and we do U: 9+1=10 -> then we clamp to 9? The problem says \"y_{t+1} \\in [0,9]\". So it must be clamped? But the problem doesn't specify clamping. However, the rule says: \"y_{t+1} \\in [0,9]\". So if we try to go above 9, we stay at 9? \n\nBut the problem does not explicitly say what happens when going out of bounds. However, we can avoid that by staying.\n\nAlternatively, we can do:\n\n  Turn12: U -> at turn13: y=9 (goal reached at turn13, which is t1+H-1 for H=2? t1+H-1 = 12+2-1=13, so we are at 9 at turn13). Then we have to take a second action at turn13? But that action doesn't change our position? \n\nBut the problem doesn't require that we stop at 9, only that at turn t1+H-1 we are at 9. So we can take an extra action? But that would be non-minimal? Because we could have H=1? But we saw H=1 doesn't work because at turn12 we are at 8.\n\nWait, let me reexamine the indexing.\n\nWe start at turn t1 (12) at position (0,8). We want to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1.\n\nFor H=1: we require at turn t1+H-1 = 12+1-1=12, we are at 9. But we are at 8, so not.\n\nFor H=2: we require at turn 13 we are at 9.\n\nHow to get to 9 at turn13? We take an action at turn12: U -> then at turn13 we are at 9. Then we must also take an action at turn13? But we are already at 9 at the beginning of turn13? Then the action at turn13 is taken at a state that is already the goal? \n\nThe problem says: the sequence of actions from t1 to t1+H-1. For H=2, that is two actions: at turn12 and turn13.\n\nBut note: the condition is only on the state at turn t1+H-1 (which is turn13). So we can take any action at turn13? However, we must avoid collisions. At turn13 we are at y=9 (which is safe). Then we can take action S (stay) at turn13? Then we remain at 9. \n\nBut then we have taken two actions and we are at turn14? But the condition only requires that at turn13 (which is t1+H-1) we are at 9. At turn14 we are still at 9? So that satisfies? \n\nActually, the problem only requires that we reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1. It doesn't say we have to stop. So yes.\n\nBut we want minimal H. H=2 is the minimal because H=1 is not possible.\n\nAlternatively, we might be able to reach 9 at turn12? But we start at 8 at turn12. Without any action, we are at 8. To get to 9 we need an action. So we cannot be at 9 at turn12.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=2.\n\nBut let me confirm with the car positions. We already checked that at turn12, freeway8 is safe. Now, what about during the movement? \n\nThe problem says: collision occurs at turn T only if we are on freeway y_T and at that turn, a car on that freeway has 0 in its span.\n\nAt turn12: we are at y=8 -> check freeway8 at turn12: safe (as above).\nAt turn13: we are at y=9 -> no freeway to check (since cars are on 1-8).\n\nSo we are safe.\n\nBut wait: when we take the action at turn12, we are moving from y=8 to y=9. The note says: if we move to y_{T+1} != y_T at turn T, then we are not considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T. So at turn12, we are only on y=8. Then at turn13, we are on y=9. So we only check the freeway we are currently on at that turn.\n\nTherefore, the plan is safe.\n\nSo the sequence is:\n\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: S   (or U or D? But if we do U at turn13, we try to go to 10, but then clamped to 9? The problem doesn't specify clamping. To be safe, we do S. But the problem says: \"y_{t+1} \\in [0,9]\" so if we do U at 9, we get 10 which is not in [0,9]? Then what? The problem doesn't say. So to avoid ambiguity, we do S.\n\nAlternatively, we can do D? But that would take us to 8 at turn14, which is not desired? But the goal only requires we are at 9 at turn13 (which we are). So we can do anything? But we are required to provide a sequence that gets us to 9 at turn13 and then we can do S.\n\nBut the problem does not require to stay at 9, only to be there at turn13. However, to be safe (no collision) we must check the freeway we are on at turn13: y=9 (safe). Then at turn13 we take an action. If we take D, then at turn14 we go to 8. But that might cause a collision? We don't care about turn14? The problem only requires that at turn13 we are at 9. So we can take any action? \n\nBut we must avoid collisions at every turn we are in. At turn13 we are at y=9 (safe). Then we take an action: if we take D, then we move to y=8 at turn14. But at turn14, we are at y=8 and we must check freeway8 at turn14? But the problem doesn't require to avoid collisions beyond the turn when we reach the goal? Actually, the problem says: \"avoid collisions with cars ...\", meaning for every turn until we reach the goal? But note: we reach the goal at turn13. So we only need to avoid collisions from turn12 to turn13? \n\nThe problem states: \"to reach (0,9)\" and \"avoid collisions\". So we must avoid collisions during the entire journey until we reach the goal. The goal is reached at turn13. So we are safe at turn12 and turn13. Then the action at turn13 is taken at turn13, but after we have already reached the goal? \n\nHowever, the collision condition is per turn: at every turn T, if we are on a freeway 1-8, we check. At turn13 we are at y=9 (safe). Then we take an action at turn13: that action will lead to turn14. But the problem does not require that we avoid collisions after reaching the goal? Since the goal is reached at turn13, we don't care about what happens after? \n\nBut the problem says: \"a sequence of actions ... to reach (0,9) avoiding collisions\". So we must avoid collisions during the entire sequence of actions? The entire sequence includes the action at turn13? And that action leads to a state at turn14? But at turn14 we are at y=8 (if we do D) and then we must avoid collision at turn14? \n\nThis is ambiguous. To be safe, we should not cause a collision at any turn during the entire sequence. Therefore, we must ensure that for every turn from t1 (12) to t1+H-1 (13) we are safe? But the action at turn13 will lead to turn14, and we are at turn14? So we must also be safe at turn14? \n\nBut note: the goal is reached at turn13. The problem says \"to reach (0,9)\" and that happens at turn13. The subsequent actions are not part of the journey? However, the problem requires a sequence of H actions. \n\nTo avoid complications, we can choose an action at turn13 that doesn't cause a collision at turn14? But we don't care about turn14? Or we can just stay at 9? Then at turn14 we are at 9 (safe). \n\nTherefore, we do:\n\nTurn12: U\nTurn13: S\n\nThen:\n  At turn12: we are at y=8 (safe).\n  Action U: then at turn13, we are at y=9 (safe).\n  Then at turn13, we take S: we stay at y=9 for turn14? But we don't need to, but that is safe.\n\nSo the sequence is:\n\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: S\n\nBut note: the problem says the answer format:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1}\n...\n}\n\nSo for H=2, we have two actions: at turn12 and turn13.\n\nBut wait: the problem says the sequence is for t=0 to H-1, so:\n  t=0: turn12\n  t=1: turn13\n\nSo we write:\n\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: S\n\nBut is there a possibility to do it in H=1? We saw no. So H=2 is minimal.\n\nBut let me check if we can do it without the extra action? Actually, the problem requires that we are at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1. For H=1, that turn is 12, and we are at 8, not 9. So no.\n\nAlternatively, is there a way to be at 9 at turn12? Only if we start at 9, but we start at 8.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 2.\n\nBut wait: what if we do something else? For example, if we go down? That would be counterproductive. Or if we stay? Then we are at 8 at turn13, then we would have to move up at turn13 to be at 9 at turn14. Then H would be 3: \n  Turn12: S -> at turn13: 8\n  Turn13: U -> at turn14: 9\n  Then we require at turn t1+H-1 = 12+3-1=14: we are at 9. Then we need an action at turn14? So H=3: three actions.\n\nThat is worse.\n\nSo the minimal H is 2.\n\nBut we must check if at turn13, when we are at y=9, we are safe? We are, because no cars on y=9.\n\nAnd at turn12, we are at y=8: we checked the cars at turn12 on freeway8: no car at 0.\n\nTherefore, the plan is safe.\n\nBut wait: the car update: we are given the car state at turn12. Then at turn13, the cars move. However, we don't need to check freeway8 at turn13 because at turn13 we are at y=9. So we are safe.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: S\n}\n\nBut note: the current turn is t1=12. The problem says \"current turn is {t_1}\" and t_1=12.\n\nIn the answer format, we write:\n\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: S\n\nBut let me check the car on freeway8 at turn12 again? The cars are:\n\nCar1: (-16, -27, right, 4) -> at turn12: [-27, -16] -> 0 not in there.\nCar2: (60,49,right,4) -> [49,60] -> 0 not in there.\nCar3: (24,13,right,4) -> [13,24] -> 0 not in there.\n\nSo safe.\n\nBut what about the other freeways? We don't step on them. We are at y=8 at turn12 and then at turn13 at y=9. So we never step on freeways 1-7 during these two turns? So we don't need to check them.\n\nTherefore, the answer is as above.\n\nBut the problem says: the player is at (0,8) at turn12. We move to (0,9) at turn13. Then at turn13 we do S to stay.\n\nBut note: the action at turn13 (S) is necessary to complete the sequence of H=2 actions. And it doesn't harm.\n\nAlternatively, we could do U again at turn13? But then we try to go to 10, which is not allowed. The problem says y_{t+1} must be in [0,9]. So we assume it stays at 9? Then we are still at 9 at turn14. But we don't care. So that is safe too. But to be explicit, we do S.\n\nSo I think the answer is:\n\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: S\n\nBut the problem says: \"a sequence of actions ... to reach (0,9)\" and we do that at turn13. The S at turn13 is just a formality to have two actions.\n\nTherefore, we output:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: S\n}\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 8) at turn \\(t_1 = 12\\).
