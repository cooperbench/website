The goal is to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on the freeways (y=1 to 8).\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S) at each turn. The y-coordinate changes accordingly and must stay within [0,9].\n\nThe key is to avoid being on a freeway row (y=1 to 8) at a turn T when there is a car on that freeway that covers the x=0 position at that exact turn.\n\nNote: When moving from row y at turn T to row y' at turn T+1, at turn T the player is still on row y, and at turn T+1 the player is on row y'. So we only check the freeway corresponding to the row we are on at that turn.\n\nWe are given the car states at turn t_1 (which is 0). For each car, we are given (head, tail, direction, speed). Note the representation:\n\nFor left-moving cars (none in this problem, all are right-moving? Actually, the problem states:\n  - Left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s*(T-t_1), τ - s*(T-t_1)]\n  - Right-moving: [Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s*(T-t_1), h + s*(T-t_1)]\n\nBut note: in the given data, for freeway 1,2,3,8: cars are given as (48,37,right,6) and (12,1,right,6) and (-24,-35,right,6). \nFor right-moving, the span at t_1 is [τ, h] = [37,48] for the first car? But wait, the representation in the table is (head, tail, ...). \n\nLet me clarify: \nFor a right-moving car, the head is the front (leading part) and tail is the back. So when moving right, the head is at a larger x than the tail. Therefore, the span at time t_1 is [tail, head] = [τ, h]. \n\nBut in the data, the first car on freeway 1 is (48,37,right,6). So head=48, tail=37 -> so the car spans [37,48] at time 0? But note that the car moves right, so at time T, the span becomes [37+6*T, 48+6*T].\n\nSimilarly, the second car: (12,1,right,6) -> [1,12] at time 0, then [1+6*T, 12+6*T].\nThe third car: (-24,-35,right,6) -> [-35,-24] at time 0, then [-35+6*T, -24+6*T].\n\nFor freeways 4,5,6,7: \nFirst car: (-48,-59,right,6) -> [-59,-48] at time 0, then [-59+6*T, -48+6*T]\nSecond car: (0,-11,right,6) -> [-11,0] at time 0, then [-11+6*T, 0+6*T] = [ -11+6T, 6T ]\n\nFreeway 8: same as freeway 1,2,3 but with speed 4: \n(48,37,right,4) -> [37,48] at time0 -> [37+4T,48+4T]\n(12,1,right,4) -> [1,12] -> [1+4T,12+4T]\n(-24,-35,right,4) -> [-35,-24] -> [-35+4T,-24+4T]\n\nWe are at turn T (starting at T=0) and we are at row y. We must avoid if at turn T, we are on a freeway row (y from 1 to 8) and there is a car on that freeway such that 0 is in the car's span at that turn T.\n\nNote: The collision condition is: at turn T, if the player is on freeway k (which is row k) and for any car on that freeway, 0 is in the span [τ + s*T, h + s*T] (for right-moving) or [h - s*T, τ - s*T] (for left-moving) but all cars here are right-moving.\n\nSo for a right-moving car (h, τ, right, s) at time T (from t1=0), the span is [τ + s*T, h + s*T]. We require that 0 is NOT in that interval for any car on the freeway we are on at turn T.\n\nOur plan: We start at (0,0) at turn0. We wish to get to (0,9). We can only move one row per turn (or stay). So we must go from row0 to row9. The minimal number of turns is at least 9 (if we move up every turn). But we might have to wait (by staying) to avoid cars.\n\nWe are to output the sequence of actions for turns starting at t1=0 until we reach row9.\n\nLet me denote the state at turn t: row y_t.\n\nWe need to simulate from t=0 onward. We are at row0 at t=0. We are safe at row0 and row9 because there are no cars (freeways 1-8 only). However, note that at the moment we are at row0, we don't check any car. Similarly, when we reach row9, we are safe.\n\nThe challenge is the freeways 1 to 8.\n\nWe note that the cars on each freeway are periodic because they move with constant speed and the grid is infinite. However, we are only concerned with when the car spans cover x=0.\n\nFor a car (τ, h, right, s), the car covers x=0 at time T if:\n   τ + s*T <= 0 <= h + s*T\n\nThis can be rewritten as:\n   T >= ceil( (-h)/s ) ? Actually, we can solve for T:\n\n   We require: τ + s*T <= 0 <= h + s*T\n\n   => T >= ceil( (-h)/s ) and T <= floor( (-τ)/s )? Let me check:\n\n   From 0 >= τ + s*T  => T >= ceil( (-τ)/s )? Actually:\n\n   Lower bound: τ + s*T <= 0  => T >= ceil( (-τ)/s )   [if s>0, then we divide by positive, so inequality direction remains]\n   Upper bound: 0 <= h + s*T => T >= ceil( (-h)/s )? Wait, no:\n\n   0 <= h + s*T => s*T >= -h  => T >= ceil( (-h)/s )   [if s>0]\n\nBut note: we have two inequalities:\n\n   τ + s*T <= 0   => T >= ceil( (-τ)/s )\n   h + s*T >= 0   => T >= ceil( (-h)/s )\n\nBut note that since h > τ (because the head is ahead of the tail), then (-τ) > (-h). So ceil( (-τ)/s ) >= ceil( (-h)/s ). Therefore, the binding constraint for T is:\n\n   T >= ceil( (-τ)/s )\n\n   and also we require that the interval [τ+s*T, h+s*T] covers 0, which is equivalent to:\n\n      τ+s*T <= 0 <= h+s*T\n\n   This interval of T is from T_min = ceil( (-τ)/s ) to T_max = floor( (-h)/s )? Actually, let me solve for T:\n\n   We have two conditions:\n      τ + s*T <= 0   => T <= (0 - τ) / s   [but note: since s>0, this gives an upper bound? Actually, no: τ is negative?]\n\nLet me take an example: the car on freeway1: (48,37,right,6) -> τ=37, h=48, s=6.\n\nThen the condition: 37+6*T <= 0 <= 48+6*T.\n\nBut 37+6*T <=0 => 6*T <= -37 -> T <= -37/6 ≈ -6.16 -> which is impossible for T>=0. So this car never covers 0? \n\nSimilarly, the second car: (12,1,right,6): \n   1+6*T <=0 <=12+6*T -> \n   The first inequality: 1+6*T<=0 -> T<= -1/6 -> impossible.\n\nThird car: (-24,-35,right,6): \n   τ=-35, h=-24, s=6.\n   Condition: -35+6*T <=0 <= -24+6*T\n   => 6*T <= 35 -> T <= 35/6 ≈ 5.83 -> T from 0 to 5 (since T integer) for the first inequality, but the second inequality: 0<=-24+6*T -> 6*T>=24 -> T>=4.\n   So T in [4,5] (because T<=5.83 -> T=4,5).\n\n   At T=4: \n        span = [-35+24, -24+24] = [-11,0] -> does it cover 0? Yes, because -11<=0<=0? Actually, 0 is at the boundary. The problem says \"if 0 in Span(T)\" -> so if the interval is inclusive, then 0 is included.\n\n   At T=5: \n        span = [-35+30, -24+30] = [-5,6] -> covers 0.\n\n   So at T=4 and 5, this car covers 0 on freeway1.\n\nNow the car on freeway4: second car: (0,-11,right,6) -> head=0, tail=-11, so at T=0: span=[-11,0]. So at T=0, it covers 0? \n   Condition: -11+6*0 = -11 <=0<=0 -> yes.\n\n   Also, when does it cover 0? \n      Condition: -11+6*T <=0<=0+6*T\n      => 6*T>=11 -> T>= ceil(11/6)=2? Actually, the condition for the lower bound: -11+6*T<=0 -> T<=11/6≈1.83 -> so T<=1? \n      and the upper bound: 0<=0+6*T -> always true for T>=0.\n\n   Actually, we have:\n        -11+6*T <=0  -> T <= 11/6 ≈ 1.83 -> so for integer T: T=0,1\n        and 0<=6*T -> T>=0.\n\n   So at T=0 and T=1, the car covers 0.\n\nBut note: at T=0, the car is at [-11,0] -> so 0 is included. At T=1: [-11+6,0+6]=[-5,6] -> 0 is included. At T=2: [1,12] -> 0 not included.\n\nSimilarly, the first car on freeway4: (-48,-59,right,6) -> τ=-59, h=-48, s=6.\n   Condition: -59+6*T<=0<=-48+6*T\n   => 6*T>=59 -> T>=ceil(59/6)=10 (since 59/6≈9.83 -> ceil=10)\n        and 6*T>=48 -> T>=8, but the binding constraint is T>=10.\n        and the upper bound: from 0<=-48+6*T -> 6*T>=48 -> T>=8 -> already satisfied.\n        and from -59+6*T<=0 -> T<=59/6≈9.83 -> so T<=9? \n   Actually, we have:\n        -59+6*T<=0 -> T<=59/6≈9.83 -> so T<=9 (for integer T)\n        and 0<=-48+6*T -> T>=8.\n   So T must be in [8,9]? But then T>=10 and T<=9 is impossible? \n\n   Let me check: \n        T=8: span = [-59+48, -48+48] = [-11,0] -> covers 0? yes.\n        T=9: span = [-59+54, -48+54] = [-5,6] -> covers 0.\n\n   But wait, the condition: \n        -59+6*8 = -59+48 = -11 <=0 -> true, and -48+48=0>=0 -> true -> so T=8 and T=9 are covered.\n\n   However, the condition we derived from the inequalities: \n        We require both:\n            τ+s*T <=0 -> -59+6*T<=0 -> T<=59/6≈9.83 -> so T<=9 for integer T.\n            h+s*T>=0 -> -48+6*T>=0 -> T>=8.\n\n        So T=8,9.\n\n   Therefore, the car covers 0 at T=8 and T=9.\n\nBut wait, the car on freeway4 at T=0: the second car already covers 0 at T=0 and T=1, and the first car at T=8 and T=9.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway8, the cars have speed 4.\n\nCar1: (48,37,right,4) -> τ=37, h=48 -> 37+4*T<=0<=48+4*T -> T<= -37/4 (negative) -> never.\nCar2: (12,1,right,4) -> same: T<= -1/4 -> never.\nCar3: (-24,-35,right,4) -> τ=-35, h=-24, s=4.\n        Condition: -35+4*T<=0<=-24+4*T\n        => 4*T>=35 -> T>=ceil(35/4)=9\n        => and 4*T>=24 -> T>=6, but the binding constraint is T>=9.\n        => and from -35+4*T<=0 -> T<=35/4=8.75 -> so T<=8? -> no integer T satisfies T>=9 and T<=8.75 -> so never?\n\n        Let me check:\n          T=9: -35+36=1<=0? -> no, so condition fails: 1<=0 is false.\n          T=8: -35+32=-3<=0 -> true, but then 0<=-24+32=8 -> true. So T=8: [-3,8] covers 0.\n\n        Actually, the condition is:\n            -35+4*T <=0 -> T<=35/4=8.75 -> so T=0 to 8 (integer)\n            and 0<=-24+4*T -> T>=6.\n\n        So T in [6,8]? -> T=6,7,8.\n\n        At T=6: -35+24=-11<=0<=-24+24=0 -> true? 0<=0 is true -> covers.\n        T=7: -35+28=-7<=0<=-24+28=4 -> covers.\n        T=8: -35+32=-3<=0<=8 -> covers.\n\n        So at T=6,7,8, the car covers 0 on freeway8.\n\nNow, let's summarize the dangerous times for each freeway:\n\nFreeway 1,2,3 (identical): \n    Only the third car: (-24,-35,right,6) causes danger at T=4 and T=5.\n\nFreeway 4,5,6,7 (identical): \n    Second car: (0,-11,right,6): danger at T=0,1.\n    First car: (-48,-59,right,6): danger at T=8,9.\n\nFreeway 8: \n    Only the third car: (-24,-35,right,4): danger at T=6,7,8.\n\nWe are going to traverse from row0 to row9. We start at row0 at T=0.\n\nWe must avoid:\n  On freeway1: at T=4,5 -> if we are on row1 at T=4 or T=5, we crash? But note: freeway1 is row1. Similarly, freeway2 is row2, etc.\n\nOur plan: We need to be at row9 as soon as possible. We can move up, down, or stay. Since we start at 0 and need to get to 9, we will mostly move up. However, we might need to wait (stay) on a safe row to avoid a dangerous time.\n\nWe note:\n  At T=0: we are at row0 (safe). We can choose: U (go to row1 at T=1), D (invalid because row0 is minimum -> then row0 again? Actually, the rule: y_{t+1} in [0,9]. D from 0: 0-1=-1 -> not allowed, so if we try D we stay at 0? But the rule says: \"y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t\" and then it must be in [0,9]. So if we try D at row0, we get -1 -> then we must clamp? But the problem doesn't specify clamping. It says \"y_{t+1} in [0,9]\". So I think we must not choose D at row0. Similarly, at row9, we cannot choose U.\n\nSo at row0: only U or S.\n\nSimilarly, at row9: only D or S? But we want to end at row9, so we stop when we first reach row9.\n\nOur minimal moves: 9 moves up: \n   T0: row0 -> T1: row1 -> T2: row2 -> ... -> T9: row9.\n\nBut we must check for each row and time whether we crash.\n\nLet me simulate:\n\n  T0: row0 -> safe (no freeway check)\n\n  T1: row1 -> at time T=1, we are on row1 -> check freeway1 at T=1: \n        freeway1: \n          car1: (48,37,6): at T=1: [37+6,48+6]=[43,54] -> no 0.\n          car2: (12,1,6): [1+6,12+6]=[7,18] -> no.\n          car3: (-24,-35,6): [-35+6, -24+6]=[-29,-18] -> no.\n        so safe.\n\n  T2: row2 -> at T=2: freeway2 (same as freeway1) -> same calculation: no car covers 0 at T=2.\n\n  T3: row3 -> at T=3: freeway3: same -> safe.\n\n  T4: row4 -> at T=4: freeway4 -> we are on row4 at T=4? \n        freeway4: \n          second car: (0,-11,6): at T=4: [-11+24,0+24]=[13,24] -> no 0? -> safe? \n          first car: (-48,-59,6): at T=4: [-59+24, -48+24]=[-35,-24] -> no 0.\n        So safe? \n\n        But wait, freeway4 has the same cars as described? Actually, the freeways 4,5,6,7 are identical. And we are on row4 at T=4 -> so we check freeway4.\n\n        The second car: (0,-11,right,6) at T=4: \n            tail=-11, head=0 -> so the car moves: at T, the tail becomes -11+6T, head becomes 0+6T.\n            T=4: tail=-11+24=13, head=24 -> [13,24] -> no 0.\n\n        First car: (-48,-59,right,6): \n            tail=-59, head=-48 -> at T=4: [-59+24, -48+24] = [-35,-24] -> no 0.\n\n        So safe.\n\n  T5: row5 -> at T=5: freeway5 -> same as freeway4? \n        freeway5: same cars as freeway4 -> \n            second car: at T=5: [-11+30,0+30]=[19,30] -> safe.\n            first car: [-59+30, -48+30]=[-29,-18] -> safe.\n\n  T6: row6 -> at T=6: freeway6 -> \n        second car: [-11+36, 0+36] = [25,36] -> safe.\n        first car: [-59+36, -48+36] = [-23,-12] -> safe.\n\n  T7: row7 -> at T=7: freeway7 -> \n        second car: [-11+42,0+42]=[31,42] -> safe.\n        first car: [-59+42, -48+42] = [-17, -6] -> does -17<=0<=-6? -> no, 0 is not in [-17,-6] -> safe.\n\n  T8: row8 -> at T=8: freeway8 -> \n        freeway8 has different cars: \n            car1: (48,37,right,4): at T=8: [37+32,48+32]=[69,80] -> safe.\n            car2: (12,1,right,4): [1+32,12+32]=[33,44] -> safe.\n            car3: (-24,-35,right,4): [-35+32, -24+32] = [-3,8] -> does -3<=0<=8? yes! -> crash.\n\n        So at T=8, if we are on row8, we crash because of the third car.\n\n  T9: row9 -> safe.\n\nSo the problem is at T8 on row8: we crash.\n\nWe must avoid that. How?\n\nWe can delay our arrival to row8 so that we are not there at T=8. Alternatively, we can wait on a row above or below? \n\nNote: we are at T7: we are at row7. At T7 we are safe. Then at T8, we can choose to:\n   - Move up to row8: then at T8 we are on row8 -> crash.\n   - Stay at row7: then at T8 we are still on row7 -> check freeway7 at T=8:\n        freeway7: \n          second car: (0,-11,6): at T=8: [-11+48,0+48]=[37,48] -> safe.\n          first car: (-48,-59,6): at T=8: [-59+48, -48+48] = [-11,0] -> does -11<=0<=0? yes -> crash? \n\n        Oh no! At T=8, freeway7 has the first car: [-11,0] -> so 0 is covered -> if we are on row7 at T=8, we crash.\n\n   - Or move down to row6: then at T8 we are on row6 -> check freeway6 at T=8:\n        freeway6: same cars as freeway4: \n            second car: at T=8: [-11+48,0+48]=[37,48] -> safe.\n            first car: [-59+48, -48+48]=[-11,0] -> covers 0 -> crash.\n\nSo at T=8, we cannot be on row6,7,8? \n\nWhat about row5? \n   freeway5 at T=8: \n        second car: [-11+48,0+48]=[37,48] -> safe.\n        first car: [-59+48, -48+48]=[-11,0] -> covers 0 -> crash.\n\nSimilarly, row4: same -> crash.\n\nRow3: \n   freeway3: at T=8: \n        car1: (48,37,6): [37+48,48+48]=[85,96] -> safe.\n        car2: (12,1,6): [1+48,12+48]=[49,60] -> safe.\n        car3: (-24,-35,6): [-35+48, -24+48]=[13,24] -> safe.\n\nSo row3 at T=8 is safe.\n\nRow2: same as row3: safe? \n        freeway2: same cars -> safe.\n\nRow1: same -> safe.\n\nRow0: safe, row9: safe.\n\nSo at T=8, the only safe rows are 0,1,2,3,9? But we are at T7 at row7. We cannot get to row9 in one move from row7? We can only move one step. So at T8 we can be at row6,7,8 or if we move down to row6? But we saw row6 is dangerous.\n\nAlternatively, we might have waited earlier.\n\nWe need to adjust our path.\n\nIdea: wait at a safe row until T=9, then move up.\n\nBut note: at T=8, row8 is dangerous, but at T=9, row8: \n   freeway8 at T=9: \n        car3: [-35+4*9, -24+4*9] = [-35+36, -24+36] = [1,12] -> does not cover 0 -> safe.\n\nSo if we can be at row8 at T=9, that is safe.\n\nBut how to be at row8 at T=9? \n\nWe must have been at row7 at T=8, then move up at T=8 to row8 at T=9? \n   But at T=8, we are at row7 -> which we saw is dangerous: freeway7 at T=8: the first car is at [-11,0] -> covers 0 -> crash.\n\nAlternatively, we can be at row8 at T=9 by being at row7 at T=8 and then moving up at T=8? But we cannot be at row7 at T=8 because it's dangerous.\n\nWhat if we are at row9 at T=8? Then we are safe. But we are at row7 at T=7. To get to row9 at T=8, we would need to move up twice? But we can only move one per turn.\n\nAlternatively, we can be at row8 at T=9 by being at row8 at T=8? But row8 at T=8 is dangerous.\n\nSo we must avoid being on rows 4,5,6,7,8 at T=8? But we can be on row3 at T=8.\n\nPlan: \n   We need to be at row3 at T=8. Then at T=8, we are safe. Then at T=8 we can move up to row4 at T=9? Then we are at row4 at T=9: \n        freeway4 at T=9: \n            second car: [-11+54,0+54]=[43,54] -> safe.\n            first car: [-59+54, -48+54]=[-5,6] -> covers 0? yes! -> crash.\n\n   So row4 at T=9 is dangerous.\n\n   What about row5 at T=9: \n        freeway5: same -> [-5,6] -> crash.\n\n   row6 at T=9: \n        freeway6: same -> [-5,6] -> crash.\n\n   row7 at T=9: \n        freeway7: same -> [-5,6] -> crash.\n\n   row8 at T=9: safe (as we saw).\n\n   row9 at T=9: safe.\n\nSo if we are at row3 at T=8, we can then at T=8 move up to row4 at T=9? -> crash.\n\nAlternatively, we can move up twice: \n   T8: from row3 to row4 (at T9) -> crash.\n\nOr we can move up three times? But we can only move one per turn.\n\nWe must avoid rows 4,5,6,7 at T=9? \n\nBut note the first car on freeways 4-7: at T=9: \n   span = [-59+54, -48+54] = [-5,6] -> covers 0.\n\nSo rows 4,5,6,7 at T=9 are dangerous.\n\nThe only safe rows at T=9 are 0,1,2,3,8,9.\n\nBut we are at row3 at T=8. We want to get to row9. We can:\n\n   T8: move up to row4 -> at T9 we are on row4 -> crash.\n\n   T8: stay at row3 -> then at T9 we are on row3 -> safe, but we are not at row9.\n\n   T8: move down to row2? Then at T9 we are on row2 -> check freeway2 at T=9: \n        freeway2: \n          car1: [37+54,48+54]=[91,102] -> safe.\n          car2: [1+54,12+54]=[55,66] -> safe.\n          car3: [-35+54, -24+54]=[19,30] -> safe.\n\n        so safe.\n\nBut then we are at row2 at T9, which is not 9.\n\nWe need to get to row9. We have to go up eventually.\n\nWe must wait until T=10? \n\nAt T=10, freeways 4-7: \n   second car: [-11+60,0+60]=[49,60] -> safe.\n   first car: [-59+60, -48+60]=[1,12] -> safe.\n\nSo at T=10, rows 4,5,6,7 are safe.\n\nFreeway8 at T=10: \n   car3: [-35+40, -24+40]=[5,16] -> safe.\n\nSo we can traverse rows 4-7 at T>=10 safely.\n\nHow do we get from row3 at T=8 to row9?\n\n   T8: we are at row3 -> safe (as planned) \n   T8: we can choose: \n        Option 1: stay at row3 -> then at T9 we are at row3.\n        Then at T9: we can move up to row4 -> at T10 we are at row4? \n            But note: at T9 we are at row3 (safe) and then we move to row4 at T10 -> so at T10 we are at row4 -> which is safe? \n            However, we must check: at T9 we are on row3 (safe). At T10 we are on row4: then we check freeway4 at T=10 -> safe.\n\n        Then we can move up: \n            T10: row4 -> safe.\n            T11: row5 -> safe.\n            T12: row6 -> safe.\n            T13: row7 -> safe.\n            T14: row8 -> at T14: freeway8: \n                   car3: [-35+4*14, -24+4*14] = [-35+56, -24+56] = [21,32] -> safe.\n            T15: row9 -> done.\n\n        Total turns: 15.\n\n        But we started at T0, so turns: T0 to T15 -> 16 steps? \n\n        Actually, the sequence: \n            T0: row0\n            T1: row1\n            T2: row2\n            T3: row3\n            T4: row4 -> but wait, we didn't go to row4 at T4? \n\n        We must recount our path:\n\n        We originally went:\n            T0: row0\n            T1: row1\n            T2: row2\n            T3: row3\n            T4: row4 -> but then we saw that at T8 we would be at row8 and crash, so we adjusted.\n\n        We then decided to avoid row4 at T4? \n\n        Actually, we must slow down. We need to be at row3 at T8. How?\n\n        We started at row0 at T0.\n\n        We need to get to row3 at T8. That means we have 8 turns to go from row0 to row3: that is 3 moves up and 5 stays? \n\n        For example: \n            T0: row0 -> move U to row1 -> T1: row1.\n            T1: row1 -> move U to row2 -> T2: row2.\n            T2: row2 -> move U to row3 -> T3: row3.\n            Then from T3 to T8 (5 turns) we must stay at row3? \n                T3: row3 -> S -> T4: row3\n                T4: row3 -> S -> T5: row3\n                T5: row3 -> S -> T6: row3\n                T6: row3 -> S -> T7: row3\n                T7: row3 -> S -> T8: row3 -> safe.\n\n        Then T8: we are at row3 -> then we do:\n                T8: U -> row4 at T9 -> but then at T9 we are at row4 -> which is dangerous? \n                    freeway4 at T9: [-5,6] -> crash.\n\n        So we cannot move to row4 at T9.\n\n        Instead, we wait at row3 until T9? \n            T8: S -> row3 at T9 -> safe (freeway3 at T9: same as T8: safe? \n                freeway3: car3 at T9: [-35+54, -24+54]=[19,30] -> safe.\n\n            Then at T9: we are at row3 -> then we move up to row4 at T10 -> safe (freeway4 at T10: [1,12] and [49,60] -> no 0).\n\n        Then:\n            T10: row4 -> safe.\n            T11: row5 -> safe.\n            T12: row6 -> safe.\n            T13: row7 -> safe.\n            T14: row8 -> safe (freeway8 at T14: [21,32] -> safe).\n            T15: row9 -> done.\n\n        Total turns: 16 (from T0 to T15, so 16 actions: T0 to T15 inclusive? But note: we do an action at each turn. We start at T0 and do an action at T0, then T1, ... until T15 (which is the 16th turn). But the goal is to be at row9 at the last action.\n\n        How many actions? We start at T0 and do actions at T0, T1, ... T15 -> that's 16 actions. The player position after the last action (at T15) is row9.\n\n        But the minimal we hoped for was 9, but we have 16.\n\n        Is there a faster way?\n\nAlternative plan: \n\n   We avoid the danger at T8 on row8 by being at row9 at T8? But we can only move one per turn. At T7 we are at row7, so we cannot get to row9 at T8.\n\n   Or we can be at row8 at T9? Then we avoid T8. But to be at row8 at T9, we must be at row7 at T8 and then move up at T8. But at T8, row7 is dangerous.\n\n   How about being at row6 at T7? Then we can move up to row7 at T8? But row7 at T8 is dangerous.\n\n   Or we can be at row8 at T7? Then at T7 we are at row8 -> check freeway8 at T=7: \n        freeway8: car3: [-35+4*7, -24+4*7]=[-35+28, -24+28]=[-7,4] -> covers 0? yes -> crash.\n\n   So we cannot be at row8 at T7.\n\n   How about row8 at T10? Then we are safe. \n\n   We can try to slow down earlier. For example, we can wait at row0 for a few turns? \n\n   We start at row0. We must eventually go up. \n\n   Let me try to get to row8 at T10:\n\n        We need to be at row8 at T10. That means we have 10 turns to go from row0 to row8: 8 moves up and 2 stays.\n\n        We can distribute the stays. But note we must avoid dangerous times.\n\n        We know:\n          T8: rows 4,5,6,7,8 are dangerous (for rows 4-7: because of the first car? actually, for freeway4-7: at T=8, the first car is at [-11,0] -> so rows4,5,6,7 are dangerous at T8; and row8 is dangerous because of freeway8 car3).\n\n          T9: rows4,5,6,7 are dangerous (because of the first car: [-5,6] at freeway4-7) and row8 is safe? \n                freeway8 at T9: [1,12] -> safe.\n\n          T10: all rows 4-8 are safe.\n\n        So we want to avoid being on rows4,5,6,7 at T8 and T9, and row8 at T8.\n\n        We can be at row3 at T8 and T9? safe.\n\n        Then at T10, we can be at row4.\n\n        Plan:\n\n          T0: row0 -> move U to row1 -> T1: row1 (safe)\n          T1: move U to row2 -> T2: row2 (safe)\n          T2: move U to row3 -> T3: row3 (safe)\n          T3: stay at row3 -> T4: row3 (safe)\n          T4: stay at row3 -> T5: row3 (safe)\n          T5: stay at row3 -> T6: row3 (safe)\n          T6: stay at row3 -> T7: row3 (safe)\n          T7: stay at row3 -> T8: row3 (safe)\n          T8: stay at row3 -> T9: row3 (safe)\n          T9: move U to row4 -> T10: row4 (safe)\n          T10: move U to row5 -> T11: row5 (safe)\n          T11: move U to row6 -> T12: row6 (safe)\n          T12: move U to row7 -> T13: row7 (safe)\n          T13: move U to row8 -> T14: row8 (safe, because T14: freeway8: [-35+4*14, -24+4*14]=[21,32] -> safe)\n          T14: move U to row9 -> T15: row9 -> done.\n\n        That's 15 actions (from T0 to T14) and we finish at T15? \n\n        But note: we do actions at T0, T1, ... T14 (15 actions) and the last action (T14) moves us to row9 at T15. But the problem: we are to output the sequence until we reach row9. We are at row9 at T15, so we stop at the action at T14? \n\n        How many turns? H is the number of turns. We start at turn t1=0, and we do H actions: t=0 to t=H-1, and at turn t1+H-1 we are at row9.\n\n        Here, at T0 we start at row0. After H actions, at turn = 0+H-1, we are at row9.\n\n        We are at row9 at T15. So the turn index at the end is 15. Then:\n            0 + H - 1 = 15 -> H=16.\n\n        So 16 actions.\n\n        But is there a way with fewer?\n\nWe could try to be at row8 at T10 without waiting so long at row3.\n\n   We need to be at row8 at T10. We can be at row3 at T8, then at T8 we move up to row4 at T9? -> but row4 at T9 is dangerous.\n\n   We must be at row3 at T9? Then we can move up at T9 to row4 at T10 -> safe.\n\n   So we need to be at row3 at T9. How many moves up? 3 moves. And we have 9 turns (T0 to T9) to get to row3? That is 9 turns for 3 moves: so we have 6 extra stays. We can distribute them arbitrarily as long as we avoid danger.\n\n   But note: we must avoid being on a dangerous row at a dangerous time.\n\n   Danger times per row:\n\n      For freeways 1-3: dangerous at T=4,5 -> so if we are on row1,2,3 at T=4 or T=5, we crash? \n          Actually, freeway1: row1 -> dangerous at T=4,5? \n                freeway1 at T=4: car3: [-35+24, -24+24]=[-11,0] -> covers 0 -> so row1 at T=4 is dangerous.\n                freeway1 at T=5: car3: [-35+30, -24+30]=[-5,6] -> covers 0 -> dangerous.\n\n          Similarly, row2 and row3 at T=4,5 are dangerous? \n                freeway2: same as freeway1 -> dangerous at T=4,5.\n                freeway3: same.\n\n      For freeways 4-7: \n          T=0,1: dangerous for rows4,5,6,7? \n                Actually, at T=0,1: dangerous for any row in 4-7? \n          But note: we are only on that row at that turn.\n\n          Specifically, if we are on row4 at T=0 or T=1 -> crash. Similarly for rows5,6,7.\n\n          Also, T=8,9: dangerous for rows4,5,6,7.\n\n      Freeway8: \n          T=6,7,8: dangerous for row8.\n\n   So we must avoid:\n\n        T in {4,5}: rows1,2,3\n        T in {0,1}: rows4,5,6,7  -> but we start at row0, so we won't be on row4 at T0 or T1.\n        T in {8,9}: rows4,5,6,7\n        T in {6,7,8}: row8\n\n   Now, we want to minimize the total time.\n\n   We can do:\n\n        T0: row0 -> safe. We can move up to row1 -> then T1: row1. But T1 is not in {4,5} -> safe? \n            freeway1 at T1: car3: [-29,-18] -> safe.\n\n        T1: move up to row2 -> T2: row2 -> safe (freeway2 at T2: same calculation -> safe)\n\n        T2: move up to row3 -> T3: row3 -> safe (freeway3 at T3: car3: [-35+18, -24+18]=[-17,-6] -> safe)\n\n        T3: we are at row3. We want to avoid being at row3 at T4 and T5? \n            So we can move up to row4? -> at T4: row4 -> but T4 is dangerous for row4 (because freeway4-7 at T4: \n                freeway4: second car: [-11+24,0+24]=[13,24] -> safe.\n                         first car: [-59+24, -48+24]=[-35,-24] -> safe.\n                so actually row4 at T4 is safe? \n\n            But note: the danger for freeway4-7 is at T0,1 and T8,9. So T4 is safe for row4.\n\n        So T3: move up to row4 at T4 -> safe.\n\n        T4: we are at row4. Now, we must avoid being at rows4,5,6,7 at T8 and T9. And we must avoid row8 at T6,7,8.\n\n        How to get to row8 at T10? \n\n        We are at row4 at T4. We have 6 turns (T4 to T10) to get to row8: that requires 4 moves up and 2 stays.\n\n        We can:\n\n            T4: stay at row4 -> T5: row4 (safe, because T5 is not in {8,9} and freeway4 at T5: \n                   second car: [-11+30,0+30]=[19,30] -> safe.\n                   first car: [-59+30,-48+30]=[-29,-18] -> safe.\n\n            T5: move up to row5 -> T6: row5 -> safe? \n                   freeway5 at T6: second car: [-11+36,0+36]=[25,36] -> safe.\n                            first car: [-59+36,-48+36]=[-23,-12] -> safe.\n\n            T6: move up to row6 -> T7: row6 -> safe? \n                   freeway6 at T7: second car: [31,42] -> safe.\n                            first car: [-17,-6] -> safe.\n\n            T7: move up to row7 -> T8: row7 -> but T8 is dangerous for row7: \n                   freeway7 at T8: first car: [-59+48, -48+48]=[-11,0] -> covers 0 -> crash.\n\n        So we cannot be at row7 at T8.\n\n        We must avoid being at row7 at T8. \n\n        We can stay at row6 at T7? Then T7: row6 -> safe (as above). Then at T8: we are still at row6 -> \n                   freeway6 at T8: \n                         second car: [-11+48,0+48]=[37,48] -> safe.\n                         first car: [-59+48,-48+48]=[-11,0] -> covers 0 -> crash.\n\n        So row6 at T8 is dangerous.\n\n        Similarly, row5 at T8: same -> crash.\n\n        Row4 at T8: same -> crash.\n\n        So the only safe rows at T8 are 0,1,2,3. But we are at row6 at T7, we can move down to row5 at T8? -> crash.\n\n        We must be at row3 at T8? \n\n        But we are at row6 at T7. To get to row3 at T8, we would need to move down 3 times? -> not possible.\n\n        So we need to be at row3 earlier? \n\n        Alternatively, we can be at row7 at T10? \n\n        We want to be at row8 at T10. We can be at row7 at T9? \n            But at T9, row7 is dangerous: freeway7 at T9: first car: [-5,6] -> covers 0 -> crash.\n\n        So we cannot be at row7 at T9.\n\n        How about row7 at T10: safe.\n\n        So to be at row8 at T10, we must be at row7 at T9? But row7 at T9 is dangerous.\n\n        We must be at row7 at T10? Then we can move to row8 at T10? But we are only at row7 at T10, then we move to row8 at T11.\n\n        So we are at row8 at T11: \n            freeway8 at T11: [-35+44, -24+44]=[9,20] -> safe.\n\n        Then we can move to row9 at T12.\n\n        How to get to row7 at T10 safely?\n\n        From row4 at T4, we have 6 turns (T4 to T10) to get to row7: 3 moves up and 3 stays.\n\n        We must avoid being on a dangerous row at a dangerous time.\n\n        Dangerous times for rows4-7: T0,1,8,9. So T4 to T7 and T10 are safe for these rows.\n\n        So we can do:\n\n            T4: row4 -> safe.\n            T5: move up to row5 -> safe.\n            T6: move up to row6 -> safe.\n            T7: move up to row7 -> safe (T7 is not dangerous for row7: T7 is safe for freeway7? \n                   freeway7 at T7: \n                         second car: [31,42] -> safe.\n                         first car: [-17,-6] -> safe.\n\n            Then T7: we are at row7. Then we must avoid T8 and T9? \n\n            We can stay at row7 at T8? -> dangerous (freeway7 at T8: [-11,0] -> crash).\n            Or move down? But moving down to row6 at T8: dangerous (freeway6 at T8: [-11,0] -> crash).\n\n            So we must move down further? \n\n            We can move down to row5 at T8? -> dangerous.\n            row4? dangerous.\n            row3? safe, but we are at row7 at T7, we can move down to row6 at T8? -> dangerous.\n\n        So we cannot be at row7 at T7 if we then have to face T8.\n\n        We must not be on row7 until T10. So we should not move up to row7 until T10.\n\n        Therefore, we should stay at row6 until T10? \n\n            T7: at row6 -> safe (freeway6 at T7: safe) -> then we can stay at row6 for T8? -> dangerous (freeway6 at T8: crash).\n\n        Or we move down from row6 to row5 at T7? Then at T7 we are at row5 -> safe? \n            freeway5 at T7: \n                   second car: [31,42] -> safe.\n                   first car: [-17,-6] -> safe.\n\n            Then at T8: we can move down to row4? -> dangerous (row4 at T8: crash).\n\n            Or stay at row5 at T8: crash.\n\n        So we must move down to row3 at T8? But that's 3 moves down from row6 at T7: not possible.\n\n        Therefore, the safest is to go back to row3 at T8. \n\n        But we are at row4 at T4. We can:\n\n            T4: row4 -> safe.\n            T5: move up to row5 -> safe.\n            T6: move up to row6 -> safe.\n            T7: move down to row5 -> safe? \n                   freeway5 at T7: safe.\n            T8: move down to row4 -> dangerous? freeway4 at T8: first car: [-11,0] -> crash.\n\n        Or at T7: move down twice? not possible.\n\n        Or we can be at row3 at T8 by:\n\n            T4: row4 -> safe.\n            T5: move down to row3 -> safe.\n            T6: stay at row3 -> safe.\n            T7: stay at row3 -> safe.\n            T8: stay at row3 -> safe.\n\n        Then we are at row3 at T8. Then we can proceed as before.\n\n        Then the rest:\n\n            T8: row3\n            T9: row3 (safe)\n            T10: move up to row4 (safe)\n            T11: move up to row5 (safe)\n            T12: move up to row6 (safe)\n            T13: move up to row7 (safe)\n            T14: move up to row8 (safe, freeway8 at T14: [21,32])\n            T15: move up to row9\n\n        Total turns: 16.\n\n        The entire sequence:\n\n            T0: U (to row1)\n            T1: U (to row2)\n            T2: U (to row3)\n            T3: U (to row4)   [but wait, we want to be at row4 at T4? and then move down?]\n\n        Alternatively, we can avoid going up to row4 at T3. \n\n        Revised for the first part:\n\n            We need to be at row3 at T8.

The number of turns H=15.\n\n        But we start at turn0, and after 15 actions, the last turn is turn14, and we are at row9 at turn15? \n\n        How does the update work? \n            At turn0 (T0), we are at row0. We apply action a0 (U) -> then at the beginning of turn1 we are at row1.\n            ...\n            At turn14 (T14), we are at row8. We apply action a14 (U) -> then at the beginning of turn15 we are at row9.\n\n        The problem: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\n        We reach (0,9) at turn15. So we need to include actions from turn0 to turn14? That's 15 actions, and H=15 turns? \n\n        But note: the player's position at turn0 is given, and then after an action at turn0, we get to the next state at turn1.\n\n        The problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\" and the sequence is for t=0 to H-1.\n\n        We have H=15 because we do actions for 15 turns (0 to 14) and at the end of these actions, at turn15, we are at row9.\n\n        But the problem might consider the state at the turn when the action is taken. Let me read the collision rule: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if ...\". At turn0, we are at row0, safe. Then after action at turn0, we are at row1 at turn1.\n\n        So the turns when we are on a freeway are turns1 to 14? \n\n        In our plan, at turn8 (which is after we do the action at turn7 and before the action at turn8) we are at row3. Then we do action at turn8 (stay) -> then at turn9 we are still at row3.\n\n        So the dangerous turns for us are when we are at a freeway row at the beginning of the turn, before the action? \n\n        The problem says: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 in Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T\", and \"y_T\" is the row at turn T.\n\n        At the beginning of turn T, we are at row y_T. Then we choose an action, and then we update to y_{T+1}.\n\n        So at turn T, we are at row y_T, and that is when we check for collision.\n\n        Therefore, in our plan:\n\n            Turn0: row0 -> safe.\n            Turn1: row1 -> safe.\n            Turn2: row2 -> safe.\n            Turn3: row3 -> safe.\n            Turn4: row3 -> safe.\n            Turn5: row3 -> safe.\n            Turn6: row3 -> safe.\n            Turn7: row3 -> safe.\n            Turn8: row3 -> safe.\n            Turn9: row3 -> safe.\n            Turn10: row4 -> safe.\n            Turn11: row5 -> safe.\n            Turn12: row6 -> safe.\n            Turn13: row7 -> safe.\n            Turn14: row8 -> safe.\n            Turn15: row9 -> safe (goal).\n\n        We reach row9 at turn15. We do actions at turn0 to turn14. So the number of actions is 15, and the minimal number of turns H is 15? \n\n        But note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and we are to output the sequence for t=0 to H-1. Here H=15, so we output actions for turn0 to turn14.\n\n        Is there a way to do it in fewer than 15 turns? \n\n        Let me try to see if we can be at row9 by turn14.\n\n        That means we would be at row9 at turn14. To be at row9 at turn14, we must be at row8 at turn13 and then move up at turn13.\n\n        We need to be at row8 at turn13. When is freeway8 safe at turn13? \n            freeway8 car3: at T=13: [-35+4*13, -24+4*13] = [-35+52, -24+52] = [17,28] -> safe.\n\n        So row8 at turn13 is safe.\n\n        Now, can we be at row8 at turn13? We need to get from row0 to row8 in 13 turns? That's 8 moves up and 5 stays.\n\n        We must avoid:\n\n            turn4,5: rows1,2,3 -> danger\n            turn0,1: rows4,5,6,7 -> not an issue because we won't be there that early.\n            turn8,9: rows4,5,6,7 -> danger\n            turn6,7,8: row8 -> danger (but we are at row8 at turn13, which is safe)\n\n        We can try to distribute the 5 stays to avoid the danger times.\n\n        We must be off rows1,2,3 at turns4 and5. How?\n\n        We can be at row0, or row4 or above at turns4 and5. But to be at row4 or above by turn4, we need to move up 4 times in 4 turns: \n            turn0: U -> row1 at turn1\n            turn1: U -> row2 at turn2\n            turn2: U -> row3 at turn3\n            turn3: U -> row4 at turn4 -> safe? \n                   freeway4 at turn4: safe (as before) -> [13,24] and [-35,-24] -> safe.\n\n        Then at turn4: we are at row4. We must avoid being on rows4,5,6,7 at turns8 and9.\n\n        We can then move up to row5 at turn5: safe (freeway5 at turn5: safe)\n        turn6: U to row6 -> safe\n        turn7: U to row7 -> safe\n        turn8: we are at row7 -> danger! (freeway7 at turn8: [-11,0] -> crash)\n\n        So we cannot be at row7 at turn8.\n\n        We can stay at row6 at turn7 and turn8? \n            turn7: at row6 -> safe (freeway6 at turn7: safe)\n            turn8: at row6 -> danger (freeway6 at turn8: [-11,0] -> crash)\n\n        Or move down from row7 to row6 at turn8? -> then at turn8 we are at row6 -> crash.\n\n        Alternatively, we can be at row8 at turn8? -> danger (freeway8 at turn8: [-3,8] -> crash).\n\n        So we must be below row4 or above row7 at turn8? But row8 is dangerous, and row9 we can't be because we are at row7 at turn7. \n\n        We can try to be at row0 at turn8? But we are at row7 at turn7, we would have to move down 7 times in one turn? no.\n\n        We can plan to be at row3 at turn8? \n\n        From row4 at turn4, we can move down to row3 at turn5? -> safe (freeway3 at turn5: danger! -> freeway3 at turn5: car3: [-5,6] -> covers 0 -> crash) \n\n        Because at turn5 we would be at row3 -> crash.\n\n        So we cannot be at row3 at turn5.\n\n        How about turn4: we are at row4. Then we move down to row3 at turn5: \n            turn5: row3 -> freeway3 at turn5: dangerous -> crash.\n\n        Or we move down to row3 at turn4? -> then we are at row3 at turn4: freeway3 at turn4: [-11,0] -> crash.\n\n        Therefore, the earliest we can be at row8 is turn10? \n\n        And then we can be at row9 at turn11. Let's try:\n\n        We need to be at row8 at turn10: \n            freeway8 at turn10: car3: [5,16] -> safe.\n\n        How to get to row8 in 10 turns? 8 moves up and 2 stays.\n\n        We must avoid:\n            turn4,5: rows1,2,3 -> danger\n            turn8,9: rows4,5,6,7 -> danger\n            turn6,7,8: row8 -> danger (turn6,7,8 for row8) -> so turn10 is safe.\n\n        We can do:\n\n            turn0: U -> row1 at turn1\n            turn1: U -> row2 at turn2\n            turn2: U -> row3 at turn3\n            turn3: S -> row3 at turn4 -> danger! (freeway3 at turn4: [-11,0] -> crash)\n\n        We cannot be at row3 at turn4.\n\n        turn0: S -> row0 at turn1 (safe)\n        turn1: U -> row1 at turn2 (safe)\n        turn2: U -> row2 at turn3 (safe)\n        turn3: U -> row3 at turn4 -> danger.\n\n        turn0: U -> row1 at turn1\n        turn1: S -> row1 at turn2 (safe)\n        turn2: U -> row2 at turn3 (safe)\n        turn3: U -> row3 at turn4 -> danger.\n\n        turn0: U -> row1 at turn1\n        turn1: U -> row2 at turn2\n        turn2: S -> row2 at turn3 (safe)\n        turn3: U -> row3 at turn4 -> danger.\n\n        So we cannot be at row3 at turn4.\n\n        Therefore, the only way is to be at row4 or above by turn4.\n\n        turn0: U\n        turn1: U\n        turn2: U\n        turn3: U -> row4 at turn4: safe.\n\n        Then we have to do 4 more moves up (to get to row8) and we have 6 turns left (turn4 to turn10) for 4 moves: so we have 2 extra stays.\n\n        We must avoid being on rows4,5,6,7 at turn8 and turn9.\n\n        We can be at row4 at turn4, then we can move up to row5 at turn5, then to row6 at turn6, then to row7 at turn7.\n\n        Then at turn7: row7 -> safe (freeway7 at turn7: safe)\n\n        Then we have turns8 and9 to avoid rows4-7. We can move up to row8 at turn8? -> danger (freeway8 at turn8: [-3,8] -> crash).\n\n        Or we can stay at row7 at turn8: danger (freeway7 at turn8: crash).\n\n        Or move down from row7 to row6 at turn8: danger.\n\n        We can instead, after row7 at turn7, move down to row6 at turn8? -> danger.\n\n        Or we can wait at row7 for one turn? not possible because turn8 is dangerous.\n\n        How about not moving so fast:\n\n            turn4: row4 -> safe.\n            turn5: S -> row4 at turn5: safe.\n            turn6: U -> row5 at turn6: safe.\n            turn7: U -> row6 at turn7: safe.\n            turn8: we are at row6 -> danger! (freeway6 at turn8: crash)\n\n        turn4: S\n        turn5: S\n        turn6: U to row5\n        turn7: U to row6\n        turn8: U to row7 -> danger (row7 at turn8: crash)\n\n        turn4: U to row5\n        turn5: U to row6\n        turn6: U to row7\n        turn7: S at row7 -> safe (freeway7 at turn7: safe)\n        turn8: we are at row7 -> danger.\n\n        So the only safe option at turn8 is to be at row3 or below, or row8 or above. But we are at row7. We can't get to row8 at turn8 because it's dangerous, and we can't get to row3 in one move.\n\n        Therefore, the minimal solution might be 15 turns.\n\n        We output the 15-action sequence.\n\n        But note: in the 15-action sequence we had earlier, we were at row3 from turn3 to turn9, then moved up to row4 at turn10.\n\n        Let me write the actions:\n\n            turn0: U\n            turn1: U\n            turn2: U\n            turn3: S\n            turn4: S\n            turn5: S\n            turn6: S\n            turn7: S\n            turn8: S\n            turn9: U\n            turn10: U\n            turn11: U\n            turn12: U\n            turn13: U\n            turn14: U\n\n        This gets us to row9 at turn15.\n\n        But is there a way to save one turn? \n\n        Notice that at turn3 we are at row3. We have to wait until turn10 to move to row4. But turn10 is the first safe turn for row4 after the danger period. \n\n        However, we could move to row4 at turn10, but could we move to row4 earlier if we can avoid the danger at turn8 and turn9? \n\n        The danger for row4 is at turn8 and turn9. So if we are at row4 at turn7 or turn10, it's safe. \n\n        We are currently moving to row4 at turn10. What if we move to row4 at turn7? \n\n        In the sequence above, at turn7 we are at row3. We could do:\n\n            turn7: U (instead of S) -> then at turn8 we are at row4. \n\n        But at turn8, row4 is dangerous (freeway4 at turn8: [-11,0] -> covers 0 -> crash).\n\n        So we cannot.\n\n        move at turn6: U from row3 to row4 at turn7: safe (freeway4 at turn7: [-17,-6] -> safe), then \n        turn7: S at row4 -> safe (freeway4 at turn7: safe), \n        turn8: we must leave row4 because at turn8 it's dangerous. We can move up to row5? -> then at turn8 we are at row5: \n               freeway5 at turn8: [-11,0] -> crash.\n\n        or move down to row3 at turn8: safe? \n               freeway3 at turn8: car3: [13,24] -> safe.\n\n        So:\n\n            turn0: U\n            turn1: U\n            turn2: U -> turn3: row3\n            turn3: S -> turn4: row3\n            turn4: S -> turn5: row3\n            turn5: S -> turn6: row3\n            turn6: U -> turn7: row4  (safe)\n            turn7: D -> turn8: row3  (safe)\n            turn8: we are at row3. Then we can wait until turn10 to move up? \n            turn8: S -> turn9: row3\n            turn9: U -> turn10: row4 (safe)\n            then continue as before.\n\n        This sequence: \n            actions: 0:U,1:U,2:U,3:S,4:S,5:S,6:U,7:D,8:S,9:U,10:U,11:U,12:U,13:U,14:U -> 15 actions.\n\n        This also takes 15 turns to reach row9 at turn15.\n\n        But can we use the saved turn? In this sequence we are at row4 at turn7, then we move down to row3 at turn7 (which is allowed? \n            turn7: at row4, action D: y_{turn8} = 4-1=3 -> valid.\n\n        However, we have one extra move (the down move) so we don't save any turns.\n\n        Alternatively, after being at row4 at turn7, we could try to progress faster through the upper floors.\n\n        But we still have to avoid rows4-7 at turn8 and turn9. \n\n        After turn7: we are at row4. We cannot be at row5,6,7,8 at turn8 because: \n            row5,6,7: danger at turn8.\n            row8: danger at turn8.\n\n        So the only safe row at turn8 is row3 or below, or row9. We choose row3.\n\n        Then at turn9, we are at row3. Then at turn9, we can move to row4 at turn10.\n\n        So we still need turn10 to be at row4.\n\n        Therefore, the minimal is 15 turns.\n\n        We choose the first simple plan that uses only up and stay.\n\n        Final sequence (15 actions):\n\n            Turn 0: U\n            Turn 1: U\n            Turn 2: U\n            Turn 3: S\n            Turn 4: S\n            Turn 5: S\n            Turn 6: S\n            Turn 7: S\n            Turn 8: S\n            Turn 9: U\n            Turn 10: U\n            Turn 11: U\n            Turn 12: U\n            Turn 13: U\n            Turn 14: U\n\n        This means:\n\n            After action at turn0 (U): at turn1, we are at row1.\n            After action at turn1 (U): at turn2, row2.\n            After action at turn2 (U): at turn3, row3.\n            Actions at turn3 to turn8: S -> so we stay at row3 from turn3 to turn9.\n            After action at turn9 (U): at turn10, row4.\n            turn10: U -> turn11: row5.\n            turn11: U -> turn12: row6.\n            turn12: U -> turn13: row7.\n            turn13: U -> turn14: row8.\n            turn14: U -> turn15: row9.\n\n        And we are done.\n\n        But note: the problem says \"current turn is t_1\", and here t_1=0. The answer should be:\n\n            Turn 0: U\n            Turn 1: U\n            Turn 2: U\n            Turn 3: S\n            Turn 4: S\n            Turn 5: S\n            Turn 6: S\n            Turn 7: S\n            Turn 8: S\n            Turn 9: U\n            Turn 10: U\n            Turn 11: U\n            Turn 12: U\n            Turn 13: U\n            Turn 14: U\n\n        We output that.\n\n        However, note that at turn8 we do a stay, and then at turn9 we move up. We are safe at every turn.\n\n        Let me verify turn by turn for safety:\n\n          turn0: row0 -> safe.\n          turn1: row1 -> freeway1: T=1: car3: [-29,-18] -> safe.\n          turn2: row2 -> freeway2: T=2: car3: [-23,-12] -> safe.\n          turn3: row3 -> freeway3: T=3: car3: [-17,-6] -> safe.\n          turn4: row3 -> freeway3: T=4: car3: [-11,0] -> covers 0? \n                -11<=0<=0 -> yes, so crash? \n\n        Oh no! We forgot that freeways 1,2,3 are dangerous at T=4 and T=5 for any row in 1,2,3.\n\n        Specifically, at turn4, we are at row3 -> freeway3. The car3 at T=4: \n            tail=-35+6*4 = -35+24 = -11, head=-24+24=0 -> span=[-11,0] -> covers 0.\n\n        So we crash at turn4.\n\n        We must not be on row3 at turn4.\n\n        Therefore, the simple waiting at row3 from turn3 to turn8 is not safe because of turn4 and turn5.\n\n        We must leave row3 by turn3 or wait in a different row.\n\n        How about waiting at row0 for two turns?\n\n        Revised plan to avoid being on row3 at turn4 and turn5:\n\n          We can be at row0 at turn4? \n\n          turn0: S -> row0 at turn1\n          turn1: S -> row0 at turn2\n          turn2: U -> row1 at turn3\n          turn3: U -> row2 at turn4\n                 freeway2 at turn4: car3: [-35+24, -24+24] = [-11,0] -> crash.\n\n        turn0: S\n        turn1: U -> row1 at turn2\n        turn2: U -> row2 at turn3\n        turn3: U -> row3 at turn4 -> crash.\n\n        turn0: U -> row1 at turn1\n        turn1: S -> row1 at turn2\n        turn2: S -> row1 at turn3\n        turn3: U -> row2 at turn4 -> freeway2 at turn4: [-11,0] -> crash.\n\n        turn0: U\n        turn1: U\n        turn2: S -> row2 at turn3\n        turn3: S -> row2 at turn4 -> freeway2 at turn4: crash.\n\n        So being on row2 at turn4 is also crash.\n\n        The only safe rows at turn4 and turn5 are row0 and row4 and above.\n\n        Therefore, we must be at row4 by turn4.\n\n        turn0: U\n        turn1: U\n        turn2: U\n        turn3: U -> row4 at turn4: safe.\n\n        Then we are at row4 at turn4. Now, we must avoid being on rows4-7 at turn8 and turn9.\n\n        We have from turn4 to turn9 (6 turns) to kill, and we need to get to row8 eventually.\n\n        We can move up to row5 at turn5: safe.\n        row6 at turn6: safe.\n        row7 at turn7: safe.\n        then at turn8: we are at row7 -> danger.\n\n        So we need to leave rows4-7 by turn7? \n\n        We can move down from row7 to row3 at turn8? not possible.\n\n        Alternatively, we can from row4 at turn4, move down to row3 at turn5? -> then at turn5: row3 -> danger (freeway3 at turn5: car3: [-5,6] -> covers 0 -> crash)\n\n        So we cannot be at row3 at turn5.\n\n        The only safe haven at turn8 and turn9 is row3 or below. But we are at row7 at turn7. We can move down to row6 at turn8: -> danger (freeway6 at turn8: crash)\n\n        Therefore, the only safe places at turn8 and turn9 are row0,1,2,3. \n\n        How to get to row3 from row4 by turn8? \n\n        turn4: row4\n        turn5: move down to row3 -> turn5: row3 -> danger at turn5.\n\n        So we must not be at row3 at turn5.\n\n        We can be at row3 at turn8 and turn9. \n\n        How to be at row3 at turn8? \n\n          turn4: row4\n          turn5: we can move down to row3? -> then at turn5: row3 -> danger.\n\n        turn4: row4\n        turn5: move down to row3 -> crash at turn5.\n\n        turn4: row4\n        turn5: stay at row4 -> turn5: row4 (safe)\n        turn6: move down to row3 -> turn6: row3 (safe? freeway3 at turn6: car3: [-35+36, -24+36]=[1,12] -> safe)\n        turn7: stay at row3 -> turn7: row3 (safe)\n        turn8: stay at row3 -> turn8: row3 (safe)\n        turn9: stay at row3 -> turn9: row3 (safe)\n\n        Then we can move up from turn9 to turn14 as before.\n\n        Total actions: \n            turn0: U\n            turn1: U\n            turn2: U\n            turn3: U -> turn4: row4\n            turn4: S -> turn5: row4\n            turn5: D -> turn6: row3\n            turn6: S -> turn7: row3\n            turn7: S -> turn8: row3\n            turn8: S -> turn9: row3\n            turn9: U -> turn10: row4\n            turn10: U -> turn11: row5\n            turn11: U -> turn12: row6\n            turn12: U -> turn13: row7\n            turn13: U -> turn14: row8\n            turn14: U -> turn15: row9\n\n        15 actions.\n\n        Verify safety:\n\n          turn0: row0 -> safe.\n          turn1: row1 -> safe.\n          turn2: row2 -> safe.\n          turn3: row3 -> safe (freeway3 at turn3: car3: [-17,-6] -> safe).\n          turn4: row4 -> safe (freeway4: [13,24] and [-35,-24] -> safe).\n          turn5: row4 -> safe.\n          turn6: row3 -> safe (freeway3 at turn6: [1,12] -> safe).\n          turn7: row3 -> safe.\n          turn8: row3 -> safe.\n          turn9: row3 -> safe.\n          turn10: row4 -> safe.\n          turn11: row5 -> safe.\n          turn12: row6 -> safe.\n          turn13: row7 -> safe.\n          turn14: row8 -> safe.\n\n        This seems safe.\n\n        Therefore, we output this sequence.\n\n        Note: at turn5, we do 'D' from row4 to row3. That is valid.\n\n        The sequence in the required format:\n\n            Turn 0: U\n            Turn 1: U\n            Turn 2: U\n            Turn 3: U\n            Turn 4: S\n            Turn 5: D\n            Turn 6: S\n            Turn 7: S\n            Turn 8: S\n            Turn 9: S\n            Turn 10: U\n            Turn 11: U\n            Turn 12: U\n            Turn 13: U\n            Turn 14: U\n\n        But wait, after action at turn3 (U) we are at row4 at turn4.\n        Then at turn4: action S -> stay at row4 at turn5.\n        Then at turn5: action D -> move down to row3 at turn6.\n\n        So the action at turn5 is D, and then at turn6 we are at row3.\n\n        This matches.\n\n        We'll output this.\n\n        But note the initial condition: player at (0,0) at turn0.\n\n        This sequence has 15 actions, and we reach row9 at turn15.\n\n        Therefore, the minimal number of turns H is 15.\n\n        Final answer.\n</think>\nTo reach the goal position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 0) in minimal turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to 8, the following sequence of actions is determined. The cars on the freeways move at specified speeds, and collision occurs if the player is on a freeway row (y=1 to 8) at a turn T where any car on that row's freeway covers the x=0 position at that turn.\n\nThe dangerous turns for each freeway are:\n- Freeways 1, 2, 3: dangerous at turns 4 and 5 (due to car (-24, -35, right, 6) covering x=0).\n- Freeways 4, 5, 6, 7: dangerous at turns 0, 1, 8, and 9 (due to cars (0, -11, right, 6) and (-48, -59, right, 6)).\n- Freeway 8: dangerous at turns 6, 7, and 8 (due to car (-24, -35, right, 4)).\n\nThe minimal number of turns required is 15, with the player reaching (0, 9) at turn 15 after executing 15 actions (from turn 0 to turn 14). The sequence avoids all dangerous positions:\n\n- **Turn 0**: Move up (U) to row 1 (safe, as row 0 has no freeway).\n- **Turn 1**: Move up (U) to row 2 (safe, freeway 2 at turn 1: car spans do not cover x=0).\n- **Turn 2**: Move up (U) to row 3 (safe, freeway 3 at turn 2: car spans do not cover x=0).\n- **Turn 3**: Move up (U) to row 4 (safe, freeway 4 at turn 3: cars at [13, 24] and [-35, -24], no x=0).\n- **Turn 4**: Stay (S) at row 4 (safe, freeway 4 at turn 4: same as turn 3).\n- **Turn 5**: Move down (D) to row 3 (safe, freeway 3 at turn 5: car at [1, 12], no x=0; note turn 5 is dangerous for row 3, but the car span changed and does not cover x=0 at turn 5 for freeway 3).\n- **Turn 6**: Stay (S) at row 3 (safe, freeway 3 at turn 6: car at [1, 12], no x=0).\n- **Turn 7**: Stay (S) at row 3 (safe, freeway 3 at turn 7: car at [7, 18], no x=0).\n- **Turn 8**: Stay (S) at row 3 (safe, freeway 3 at turn 8: car at [13, 24], no x=0).\n- **Turn 9**: Stay (S) at row 3 (safe, freeway 3 at turn 9: car at [19, 30], no x=0).\n- **Turn 10**: Move up (U) to row 4 (safe, freeway 4 at turn 10: cars at [49, 60] and [1, 12], no x=0).\n- **Turn 11**: Move up (U) to row 5 (safe, freeway 5 at turn 11: same as freeway 4 at turn 10).\n- **Turn 12**: Move up (U) to row 6 (safe, freeway 6 at turn 12: same as freeway 4 at turn 10).\n- **Turn 13**: Move up (U) to row 7 (safe, freeway 7 at turn 13: same as freeway 4 at turn 10).\n- **Turn 14**: Move up (U) to row 8 (safe, freeway 8 at turn 14: car at [21, 32], no x=0).\n\nAt turn 15, the player reaches row 9 (goal), which is safe.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 0: U \\\\\nTurn 1: U \\\\\nTurn 2: U \\\\\nTurn 3: U \\\\\nTurn 4: S \\\\\nTurn 5: D \\\\\nTurn 6: S \\\\\nTurn 7: S \\\\\nTurn 8: S \\\\\nTurn 9: S \\\\\nTurn 10: U \\\\\nTurn 11: U \\\\\nTurn 12: U \\\\\nTurn 13: U \\\\\nTurn 14: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,3) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. The player moves vertically with actions U (up), D (down), or S (stay), changing y by +1, -1, or 0 each turn, but y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars move horizontally on their freeways. For each car, given its position at turn t1 (which is turn 3 here), I can find where it is at any future turn T. Since all cars are moving right with given speeds, I need to make sure that when I'm on a freeway y at turn T, the position x=0 is not covered by any car on that freeway at that turn.\n\nThe collision rule says: collision occurs at turn T only if 0 is in the span of any car on freeway y_T. And importantly, when I move from y to y' at turn T, I'm not on y' until the next turn, so I only care about the freeway I'm currently on when I'm on it.\n\nAt turn T, I am on freeway y_T. If I take an action to move to y_{T+1}, I am on y_T at turn T, and on y_{T+1} at turn T+1. So for collision at turn T, I check freeway y_T at turn T.\n\nThe note says: if I decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, I am not considered on y_{T+1} at turn T, so even if there is a car covering 0 on y_{T+1} at turn T, it doesn't matter because I'm not there yet. I only need to worry about the freeway I'm currently on for each turn.\n\nNow, the current state is at turn t1 = 3.\n\nPlayer at (0,3)\n\nCar states:\n\nFor each freeway k from 1 to 8, there are cars listed with (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s).\n\nAll directions are right, so they're all moving to the right.\n\nSince they're moving right, the span is [τ, h] initially, and at time T, it's [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)] because they're moving right.\n\nDirection is given as \"right\", and for right-moving, the update is [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)], since τ is tail and h is head, so as it moves right, both increase.\n\nIn the car update, for right-moving: Span(T) = [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nSimilarly for left, but all are right here.\n\nNow, collision if at turn T, I am on freeway y, and for some car on that freeway, 0 is in [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)] at that T.\n\nt1 is 3, so for a future turn T, the time elapsed is (T - 3).\n\nI need to go from y=3 to y=9. Since I can only change y by at most 1 per turn, the minimum number of turns H must be at least 6, because 9-3=6, so if I go up every turn, H=6. But I might have to wait or go around cars, so it could be more.\n\nBut I need to avoid collisions on the freeways I traverse.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, I assume, since no cars there. y=0 is the bottom, probably no freeway, and y=9 is the target, no cars mentioned for y=9.\n\nFreeways are from y=1 to y=8, so y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, so no cars, so safe.\n\nPlayer starts at (0,3), which is on freeway y=3? No, the position is (0,y), so y is the freeway level.\n\nThe grid has vertical axis y=0 to 9, and freeways are at y=1 to 8, I think. But player can be at y=0 or y=9, which are not freeways, so no cars.\n\nBut when player is at y=k for k=1 to 8, that's on freeway k.\n\nAt y=0 or y=9, no cars, so always safe.\n\nNow, I need to reach (0,9), so at some turn, I need to be at y=9.\n\nNow, for each freeway from 1 to 8, I need to know when it is safe to be there, i.e., when no car covers x=0.\n\nFor each freeway, I have a list of cars, and for each car, I can find the times when it covers x=0.\n\nA car covers x=0 at time T if 0 is in [τ + s*(T-3), h + s*(T-3)] for that car.\n\nSince all cars are moving right, and s is speed.\n\nLet me denote Δt = T - 3, the time since turn 3.\n\nSo for a car on freeway k, with tail τ, head h, speed s, it covers x=0 when τ + s*Δt ≤ 0 ≤ h + s*Δt.\n\nSince it's moving right, h > τ, I assume, because head is ahead.\n\nIn the span, for right-moving, head h should be greater than tail τ, I think.\n\nLook at the examples: for freeway 1, cars like (-48,-59,right,6), so h=-48, τ=-59, so τ < h since -59 < -48, and as it moves right, both increase.\n\nSimilarly, (30,19,right,6), 19 to 30, so τ=19, h=30.\n\nAnd (-6,-17,right,6), τ=-17, h=-6.\n\nSo for each car, τ and h, with τ < h since moving right.\n\nNow, the car covers x=0 when:\n\nτ + s Δt ≤ 0 ≤ h + s Δt\n\nWhich is equivalent to:\n\n- h / s ≤ Δt ≤ - τ / s\n\nBecause from τ + s Δt ≤ 0, so s Δt ≤ -τ, Δt ≤ -τ/s\n\nAnd 0 ≤ h + s Δt, so s Δt ≥ -h, Δt ≥ -h/s\n\nSince s > 0.\n\nSo the time interval when covered is [ ceil(-h/s), floor(-τ/s) ]? Let me think in terms of integer turns.\n\nΔt is integer, since turns are discrete.\n\nSo for a given car, it covers x=0 at time T (turn) if there exists integer Δt such that:\n\nτ + s Δt ≤ 0 ≤ h + s Δt\n\nWhich is max( ceil( (-h)/s ) , something) but better to solve inequalities.\n\nFrom above:\n\nΔt ≥ ceil( -h / s )\n\nΔt ≤ floor( -τ / s )\n\nBecause Δt must be integer.\n\nLet me compute.\n\nFrom τ + s Δt ≤ 0, so s Δt ≤ -τ, since s>0, Δt ≤ floor( (-τ)/s ) ? Not necessarily.\n\ns Δt ≤ -τ, so Δt ≤ floor( (-τ)/s ) only if (-τ)/s is not integer, but better to think:\n\ns Δt ≤ -τ implies Δt ≤ floor( (-τ)/s ) if we take inequality.\n\nActually, τ + s Δt ≤ 0 implies Δt ≤ ceil( (-τ)/s ) - 1? I'm confusing myself.\n\nStandard way: the smallest Δt such that τ + s Δt ≤ 0 is Δt = ceil( -τ / s )\n\nSimilarly, the largest Δt such that h + s Δt ≥ 0 is Δt = floor( -h / s )? Let's see.\n\nSet the inequalities.\n\nτ + s Δt ≤ 0 ⇒ s Δt ≤ -τ ⇒ Δt ≤ floor( (-τ)/s ) if (-τ)/s not integer, but if integer, equal.\n\nBetter to compute the range.\n\nThe car covers x=0 when:\n\n- h / s ≤ Δt ≤ - τ / s\n\nBut since Δt integer, Δt must satisfy ceil( -h / s ) ≤ Δt ≤ floor( -τ / s )\n\nBecause:\n\nFrom 0 ≤ h + s Δt, so s Δt ≥ -h, Δt ≥ ceil( -h / s )\n\nFrom τ + s Δt ≤ 0, s Δt ≤ -τ, Δt ≤ floor( -τ / s )\n\nYes.\n\nFor example, car (h, τ, s) covers x=0 for Δt from ceil(-h/s) to floor(-τ/s) inclusive.\n\nThen, for a freeway to be unsafe at Δt, if any car on that freeway covers x=0 at that Δt.\n\nOtherwise, safe.\n\nThen, for each freeway, I can find the set of Δt where it is unsafe.\n\nThen, when I plan my path, at each turn T, when I am at y, it must be that at that Δt = T-3, freeway y is safe.\n\nSince I start at turn t1=3, so at T=3, Δt=0.\n\nNow, let's list all freeways and their cars.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: cars (-48,-59,right,6), (30,19,right,6), (-6,-17,right,6)\n\nAll speed 6.\n\nCompute for each car when it covers x=0.\n\nCar 1: h=-48, τ=-59, s=6\n\nΔt min = ceil( -h/s ) = ceil( -(-48)/6 ) = ceil(48/6) = ceil(8) = 8\n\nΔt max = floor( -τ/s ) = floor( -(-59)/6 ) = floor(59/6) = floor(9.833) = 9\n\nSo covers from Δt=8 to 9.\n\nceil(-h/s) = ceil(48/6) = ceil(8) =8\n\nfloor(-τ/s) = floor(59/6) = floor(9.833) =9, so Δt=8,9.\n\nCar 2: h=30, τ=19, s=6\n\nΔt min = ceil(-h/s) = ceil(-30/6) = ceil(-5) = -5? ceil is for real numbers, ceil(-5) = -5 since integer.\n\nBut Δt is time from now, future, but it could be past, but we care about future.\n\n-30/6 = -5, ceil(-5) = -5\n\nfloor(-τ/s) = floor(-19/6) = floor(-3.166) = -4? Let's see.\n\nΔt min = ceil(-h/s) = ceil(-30/6) = ceil(-5) = -5\n\nΔt max = floor(-τ/s) = floor(-19/6) = floor(-3.166) = -4? Since floor is greatest integer less than or equal, so -3.166, less than or equal is -4? No.\n\n-3.166, integers less than or equal: -4, -5, etc., greatest is -4? No, -4 is less than -3.166? -4 < -3.166, and -3 > -3.166, so floor(-3.166) = -4? Let's clarify.\n\nFloor function: floor(x) is greatest integer n such that n <= x.\n\nFor x = -3.166, n <= -3.166, so n = -4, -5, ..., greatest is -4? -4 <= -3.166 is true, -3 > -3.166, so -3 not <= -3.166, so yes, floor(-3.166) = -4.\n\nSimilarly, ceil(x) is smallest integer n such that n >= x.\n\nceil(-5) = -5, since -5 >= -5.\n\nNow for car 2: h=30, τ=19, s=6\n\nΔt min = ceil(-h/s) = ceil(-30/6) = ceil(-5) = -5\n\nΔt max = floor(-τ/s) = floor(-19/6) = floor(-3.166) = -4\n\nNow, Δt from min to max, but min=-5, max=-4, so Δt = -5 and -4.\n\nBut Δt is T-3, and T is turn, so Δt negative means past turns, before turn 3.\n\nFor our purpose, we care about future, Δt >=0.\n\nAt Δt=-5 and -4, which are turns before 3, so for future turns, this car does not cover x=0, since the interval is over.\n\nSimilarly, car 3: h=-6, τ=-17, s=6\n\nΔt min = ceil(-h/s) = ceil(-(-6)/6) = ceil(6/6) = ceil(1) =1\n\nΔt max = floor(-τ/s) = floor(-(-17)/6) = floor(17/6) = floor(2.833) =2\n\nSo covers Δt=1,2.\n\nNow freeway 1 has three cars:\n\nCar1: covers Δt=8,9\n\nCar2: covers past, not future\n\nCar3: covers Δt=1,2\n\nSo freeway 1 is unsafe when any car covers, so unsafe at Δt=1,2,8,9.\n\nSafe at other times.\n\nNow freeway 2: same as freeway 1? \"2 | \\((-48, -59, right, 6), (30, 19, right, 6), (-6, -17, right, 6)\\)\"\n\nExactly the same as freeway 1, so unsafe at same times: Δt=1,2,8,9.\n\nNow freeway 3: same as 1 and 2? \"3 | \\((-48, -59, right, 6), (30, 19, right, 6), (-6, -17, right, 6)\\)\" yes, identical, so unsafe at Δt=1,2,8,9.\n\nNow freeway 4: \"4 | \\((-30, -41, right, 6), (18, 7, right, 6)\\)\"\n\nCars: first car h=-30, τ=-41, s=6\n\nΔt min = ceil(-h/s) = ceil(30/6) = ceil(5) =5\n\nΔt max = floor(-τ/s) = floor(41/6) = floor(6.833) =6\n\nSo covers Δt=5,6\n\nSecond car: h=18, τ=7, s=6\n\nΔt min = ceil(-h/s) = ceil(-18/6) = ceil(-3) = -3\n\nΔt max = floor(-τ/s) = floor(-7/6) = floor(-1.166) = -2\n\nSo covers Δt=-3,-2, past, not future.\n\nThus freeway 4 unsafe only from car1 at Δt=5,6.\n\nSafe other times.\n\nFreeway 5: same as freeway 4? \"5 | \\((-30, -41, right, 6), (18, 7, right, 6)\\)\" yes, identical, so unsafe at Δt=5,6.\n\nFreeway 6: same, \"6 | \\((-30, -41, right, 6), (18, 7, right, 6)\\)\" unsafe Δt=5,6.\n\nFreeway 7: same, \"7 | \\((-30, -41, right, 6), (18, 7, right, 6)\\)\" unsafe Δt=5,6.\n\nNow freeway 8: \"8 | \\((60, 49, right, 4), (24, 13, right, 4), (-12, -23, right, 4)\\)\"\n\nSpeed 4 for all.\n\nFirst car: h=60, τ=49, s=4\n\nΔt min = ceil(-h/s) = ceil(-60/4) = ceil(-15) = -15\n\nΔt max = floor(-τ/s) = floor(-49/4) = floor(-12.25) = -13? Let's compute.\n\n-49/4 = -12.25, floor(-12.25) = -13 since -13 <= -12.25 < -12\n\nΔt min = ceil(-60/4) = ceil(-15) = -15\n\nΔt max = floor(-49/4) = floor(-12.25) = -13\n\nSo covers Δt from -15 to -13, all past.\n\nSecond car: h=24, τ=13, s=4\n\nΔt min = ceil(-24/4) = ceil(-6) = -6\n\nΔt max = floor(-13/4) = floor(-3.25) = -4? -3.25, floor is -4 since -4 <= -3.25 < -3\n\nSo covers Δt from -6 to -4? min to max: Δt min = -6, Δt max = -4, so Δt = -6,-5,-4, past.\n\nThird car: h=-12, τ=-23, s=4\n\nΔt min = ceil(-h/s) = ceil(12/4) = ceil(3) =3\n\nΔt max = floor(-τ/s) = floor(23/4) = floor(5.75) =5\n\nSo covers Δt=3,4,5\n\nThus freeway 8 unsafe at Δt=3,4,5 from this car.\n\nOther cars not covering future.\n\nSo unsafe only at Δt=3,4,5.\n\nNow summarize for each freeway, unsafe at Δt:\n\nFreeway 1: unsafe Δt=1,2,8,9\n\nFreeway 2: same, Δt=1,2,8,9\n\nFreeway 3: same, Δt=1,2,8,9\n\nFreeway 4: unsafe Δt=5,6\n\nFreeway 5: same, Δt=5,6\n\nFreeway 6: same, Δt=5,6\n\nFreeway 7: same, Δt=5,6\n\nFreeway 8: unsafe Δt=3,4,5\n\nSafe otherwise for all.\n\nΔt is from 0 onwards.\n\nAt Δt=0, which is turn 3, where is player? At (0,3), freeway 3.\n\nIs freeway 3 safe at Δt=0?\n\nFreeway 3 unsafe at Δt=1,2,8,9, so at Δt=0, it should be safe, since not in unsafe times.\n\nSimilarly, check others.\n\nFor freeway 3, unsafe at 1,2,8,9, so at 0, safe.\n\nAt turn T=3, Δt=0, player at y=3.\n\nNow, I need to go to y=9.\n\nMinimum turns: from y=3 to y=9, need to increase by 6, so at least 6 turns if I go up every turn.\n\nBut I have to avoid unsafe times.\n\nLet me list for each y and each Δt, safe or not.\n\nSince y=1 to 8 are freeways, but I start at y=3.\n\ny=0 and y=9 always safe, but I start at y=3, target y=9.\n\nNow, let me make a table for Δt from 0 to, say, 10, and for each y, safe or not.\n\nBut y=0 and y=9 always safe, so only y=1 to 8 matter.\n\nFreeway 1: unsafe at Δt=1,2,8,9 → safe at Δt=0,3,4,5,6,7,10,...\n\nFreeway 2: same as 1, safe at Δt=0,3,4,5,6,7,10,...\n\nFreeway 3: same, safe at Δt=0,3,4,5,6,7,10,...\n\nFreeway 4: unsafe at Δt=5,6 → safe at Δt=0,1,2,3,4,7,8,9,10,...\n\nFreeway 5: same as 4, safe at Δt=0,1,2,3,4,7,8,9,10,...\n\nFreeway 6: same, safe at Δt=0,1,2,3,4,7,8,9,10,...\n\nFreeway 7: same, safe at Δt=0,1,2,3,4,7,8,9,10,...\n\nFreeway 8: unsafe at Δt=3,4,5 → safe at Δt=0,1,2,6,7,8,9,10,...\n\nNow, player position over time.\n\nStart at turn T=3, Δt=0, y=3.\n\nAt each turn, I choose action U, D, or S, changing y by +1, -1, 0.\n\ny must stay in [0,9].\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nSince I need to go up, and y=9 is safe, I should go up as fast as possible, but avoid being on unsafe freeway at wrong time.\n\nNow, at Δt=0, y=3 is safe, as above.\n\nI can choose to go up to y=4, or stay, or down, but down to y=2 might not help, so probably up or stay.\n\nBut I need to minimize turns, so I should go up when possible.\n\nNow, let's see the path.\n\nI am at y=3 at Δt=0.\n\nI want to go to y=4.\n\nAt turn T=3, I take action for next position.\n\nAt turn T, I am at y_T, and I choose a_{T} which determines y_{T+1}.\n\nFor collision at turn T, I check freeway y_T at time T.\n\nThen at T+1, I am at y_{T+1}, and check that freeway at time T+1.\n\nIn this case, at T=3, Δt=0, y=3, which is safe.\n\nNow, I can choose to move to y=4 at T=4.\n\nT=4 corresponds to Δt=1.\n\nAt Δt=1, what is freeway 4? Freeway 4 is at y=4.\n\nFreeway 4 is unsafe only at Δt=5,6, so at Δt=1, freeway 4 is safe, since unsafe only at 5,6.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3 at Δt=1 is unsafe.\n\nBut at T=4, Δt=1, if I am at y=4, I need freeway 4 to be safe at Δt=1, which it is.\n\nBut I need to get to y=4 at T=4.\n\nAt T=3, I am at y=3, safe.\n\nI take action a_{t1} = a_3, which is for turn 3, to go to y_{4}.\n\nIf I take U, then y_4 = y_3 +1 =4.\n\nThen at T=4, Δt=1, I am at y=4, and freeway 4 must be safe at Δt=1, which it is, as above.\n\nThen I can go to y=5, and so on.\n\nBut let's see the unsafe times.\n\nI want to go to y=9.\n\ny=9 is always safe, no freeway.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 safe.\n\nNow, from y=3 at Δt=0.\n\nOption: go up to y=4 at Δt=1.\n\nAt Δt=1, y=4: freeway 4 safe? Yes, unsafe only at 5,6.\n\nSo safe.\n\nThen from there, go to y=5 at Δt=2.\n\nAt Δt=2, y=5: freeway 5.\n\nFreeway 5 unsafe at Δt=5,6, so at Δt=2, safe.\n\nThen to y=6 at Δt=3.\n\nAt Δt=3, y=6: freeway 6.\n\nFreeway 6 unsafe at Δt=5,6, so at Δt=3, safe.\n\nThen to y=7 at Δt=4.\n\nAt Δt=4, y=7: freeway 7.\n\nFreeway 7 unsafe at Δt=5,6, so at Δt=4, safe.\n\nThen to y=8 at Δt=5.\n\nAt Δt=5, y=8: freeway 8.\n\nFreeway 8 unsafe at Δt=3,4,5.\n\nAt Δt=5, unsafe! Oh, problem.\n\nAt Δt=5, freeway 8 is unsafe.\n\nSo if I arrive at y=8 at Δt=5, I collide.\n\nI need to be at y=8 at a safe time.\n\nFreeway 8 safe at Δt=0,1,2,6,7,8,9,...\n\nUnsafe at 3,4,5.\n\nSo at Δt=5, unsafe.\n\nIn the path above, at Δt=4, I was at y=7, and I go to y=8 at Δt=5, which is unsafe.\n\nI could stay or go down, but I need to reach y=9.\n\nI could go slower or faster.\n\nFrom y=7 at Δt=4, I could go to y=8, but unsafe at Δt=5.\n\nI could stay at y=7 for one turn, then go to y=8.\n\nAt Δt=4, y=7 is safe, as above.\n\nIf I stay at y=7 at Δt=5? At turn T, when I stay, y_{T+1} = y_T, so at same position.\n\nAt Δt=5, if I am at y=7, freeway 7 at Δt=5.\n\nFreeway 7 is unsafe at Δt=5,6? Freeway 7 unsafe at Δt=5,6.\n\nYes, from above, freeway 7 unsafe at Δt=5,6.\n\nSo at Δt=5, if I am at y=7, it is unsafe!\n\nSimilarly, y=6,5,4 all unsafe at Δt=5,6.\n\nLet's list safe times for each y.\n\nFor y=4,5,6,7: unsafe at Δt=5,6\n\ny=4,5,6,7 all have unsafe at Δt=5,6.\n\ny=1,2,3 unsafe at Δt=1,2,8,9\n\ny=8 unsafe at Δt=3,4,5\n\nNow back to path.\n\nI am at y=3 at Δt=0, safe.\n\nGo to y=4 at Δt=1: y=4 safe at Δt=1? Yes, since unsafe only at 5,6.\n\nGo to y=5 at Δt=2: y=5 safe at Δt=2, yes.\n\nGo to y=6 at Δt=3: y=6 safe at Δt=3, yes (unsafe at 5,6, so 3 safe)\n\nGo to y=7 at Δt=4: y=7 safe at Δt=4, yes (unsafe at 5,6)\n\nNow at y=7 at Δt=4, safe.\n\nNext, I want to go to y=8.\n\nBut at Δt=5, y=8 unsafe, and y=7 also unsafe at Δt=5.\n\nIf I go to y=8 at Δt=5, unsafe.\n\nIf I stay at y=7 at Δt=5, unsafe because freeway 7 unsafe at Δt=5.\n\nIf I go down to y=6, at Δt=5, y=6 unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, all y=4,5,6,7 unsafe at Δt=5,6.\n\nSo at Δt=5, I cannot be on y=4,5,6,7 or 8.\n\ny=8 unsafe, y=4-7 unsafe.\n\nWhat about y=3? At Δt=5, freeway 3.\n\nFreeway 3 unsafe at Δt=1,2,8,9, so at Δt=5, it is safe? Δt=5 not in 1,2,8,9, so yes, safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=2: freeway 2 unsafe at 1,2,8,9, so at Δt=5, safe.\n\ny=1: same.\n\ny=0 always safe.\n\nBut I am at y=7 at Δt=4, I can go down to y=6, but at Δt=5, y=6 unsafe.\n\nI could go directly to y=8 from earlier.\n\nAnother idea: go faster to y=8 before Δt=3 or after Δt=5.\n\nCurrently, at Δt=4, I am at y=7.\n\nΔt=4 is turn T=3+4=7, but let's keep Δt.\n\nAt Δt=4, y=7 safe.\n\nFreeway 8 unsafe at Δt=3,4,5, so at Δt=4, y=8 would be unsafe, but I am not there.\n\nI need to reach y=8 at a safe time, like Δt=6 or later.\n\nBut at Δt=6, if I am at y=7, it is unsafe, since y=7 unsafe at Δt=6.\n\nSimilarly, y=4,5,6,7 all unsafe at Δt=6.\n\nSo I need to be at y=8 or higher at Δt=6.\n\ny=8 at Δt=6: freeway 8 safe at Δt=6, since unsafe only 3,4,5.\n\ny=9 safe.\n\nBut how to get there.\n\nFrom y=7 at Δt=4, I cannot stay or go to y=8 at Δt=5 because both unsafe.\n\nI could go to y=8 at Δt=4? At Δt=4, I am at y=7, to go to y=8, at turn with Δt=4, I am at y=7, I take U, then at next turn Δt=5, I am at y=8.\n\nBut at Δt=5, y=8 unsafe.\n\nI could delay going up earlier.\n\nStart from beginning.\n\nAt Δt=0, y=3 safe.\n\nInstead of going up immediately, I could stay or go down, but that might waste time.\n\nGo up to y=4 at Δt=1: safe.\n\nThen to y=5 at Δt=2: safe.\n\nNow at Δt=2, y=5 safe.\n\nInstead of going to y=6 at Δt=3, I could stay at y=5 for one turn.\n\nAt Δt=3, if I stay at y=5, freeway 5 at Δt=3.\n\nFreeway 5 unsafe at Δt=5,6, so at Δt=3, safe? Yes.\n\nThen at Δt=3, y=5 safe.\n\nThen I can go to y=6 at Δt=4.\n\nAt Δt=4, y=6: freeway 6 safe at Δt=4? Unsafe at 5,6, so Δt=4 safe.\n\nThen to y=7 at Δt=5? At Δt=5, y=7 unsafe.\n\nSame problem.\n\nFrom y=5 at Δt=2, I could go to y=6 at Δt=3: y=6 at Δt=3 safe.\n\nThen from y=6 at Δt=3, I could go to y=7 at Δt=4: safe.\n\nThen at Δt=4, y=7, same as before.\n\nI need to reach y=8 before Δt=3 or after Δt=5.\n\nBefore Δt=3: at Δt=0, y=3.\n\nIf I go up every turn:\n\nT=3, Δt=0, y=3 → take U, to y=4 at Δt=1\n\nT=4, Δt=1, y=4 → take U, to y=5 at Δt=2\n\nT=5, Δt=2, y=5 → take U, to y=6 at Δt=3\n\nT=6, Δt=3, y=6 → take U, to y=7 at Δt=4\n\nT=7, Δt=4, y=7 → now, if take U, to y=8 at Δt=5, unsafe.\n\nAt Δt=3, I am at y=6, which is safe.\n\nFreeway 8 unsafe at Δt=3,4,5, so at Δt=3, if I could be at y=8, but I am at y=6.\n\nTo reach y=8 at Δt=3, I need to have been at higher y earlier.\n\nAt Δt=0, y=3, I need to be at y=8 at Δt=3, which requires 5 steps up, but from Δt=0 to Δt=3, only 3 turns, y increases by at most 3, from 3 to 6, not to 8. Impossible.\n\nSimilarly, after Δt=5, I can be at y=8 at Δt=6 or later.\n\nBut at Δt=5 and 6, y=7 is unsafe, so I need to be at y=8 or y=9 at Δt=6.\n\ny=9 is target.\n\nNow, from y=7 at Δt=4, I can go down to y=6, but at Δt=5, y=6 unsafe.\n\nGo down to y=5 or lower.\n\nFor example, at Δt=4, y=7, take D, go to y=6 at Δt=5.\n\nBut at Δt=5, y=6 unsafe.\n\nTake S, stay at y=7 at Δt=5, unsafe.\n\nTake D to y=6, same.\n\nGo to y=8 at Δt=5, unsafe.\n\nSo from y=7 at Δt=4, all actions lead to unsafe at Δt=5 if I stay on freeway, or go to y=8 unsafe.\n\nUnless I go to y=9, but from y=7 to y=9 in one step? No, can only change by 1, so to y=8 first.\n\nSo impossible to avoid unsafe at Δt=5 if I am at y=7 at Δt=4.\n\nTherefore, I need to not be at y=7 at Δt=4.\n\nSimilarly, I need to arrive at y=8 later.\n\nBut to reach y=8 later, I need to be at y=7 earlier or later, but y=7 unsafe at Δt=5,6.\n\nLet's list the safe times to be on each freeway.\n\nFor y=1,2,3: safe except Δt=1,2,8,9\n\nSo safe at Δt=0,3,4,5,6,7,10,...\n\nFor y=4,5,6,7: safe except Δt=5,6\n\nSo safe at Δt=0,1,2,3,4,7,8,9,10,...\n\nFor y=8: safe except Δt=3,4,5\n\nSo safe at Δt=0,1,2,6,7,8,9,10,...\n\ny=0 and 9 always safe.\n\nNow, I start at y=3 at Δt=0.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nThe critical part is around Δt=5,6 where many freeways are unsafe.\n\nI can be on y=1,2,3 at Δt=5,6, since they are safe there.\n\nOr on y=8 at Δt=6 or later.\n\nBut y=4,5,6,7 unsafe at 5,6.\n\nSo for example, at Δt=5, I can be on y=0,1,2,3,8,9 but y=8 unsafe at 5, so only y=0,1,2,3,9.\n\nSimilarly at Δt=6, y=0,1,2,3,8,9 since y=8 safe at 6.\n\ny=9 always safe.\n\nBut to reach y=9, I need to pass through y=8 or come from below.\n\nSince y=7 is unsafe at 5,6, I might skip it or go at safe time.\n\ny=7 safe at Δt=4, for example.\n\nLet's plan the path with minimal turns.\n\nMinimum turns is 6, but let's see if possible.\n\nWith 6 turns: start at Δt=0, y=3\n\nAfter 0 turns, at y=3\n\nAfter 1 turn, at T=4, Δt=1, y=4\n\nAfter 2 turns, T=5, Δt=2, y=5\n\nAfter 3 turns, T=6, Δt=3, y=6\n\nAfter 4 turns, T=7, Δt=4, y=7\n\nAfter 5 turns, T=8, Δt=5, y=8\n\nAfter 6 turns, T=9, Δt=6, y=9\n\nBut at T=8, Δt=5, y=8: unsafe\n\nAt T=7, Δt=4, y=7: safe, but next to y=8 at Δt=5 unsafe.\n\nIf I go directly to y=9 from y=7, not possible, only one step.\n\nSo with 6 turns, I end at y=9 at Δt=6, but to reach there, I must be at y=8 at Δt=5 or earlier, but at Δt=5, y=8 unsafe, and at earlier, I can't reach.\n\nIn the sequence, at Δt=5, I am at y=8, which is unsafe, so collision.\n\nSo impossible in 6 turns.\n\nNeed at least 7 turns.\n\nWith 7 turns, I can reach y=9 at Δt=7, for example.\n\nStart at Δt=0, y=3.\n\nI need to be at y=9 at some Δt.\n\nLet me define the turns.\n\nLet t be the turn number from t1=3.\n\nSo turn t=3,4,5,6,7,8,9,...\n\nΔt = t - 3.\n\nAt each turn, position y_t.\n\ny_3 = 3.\n\nI need to find actions such that for each t, when on freeway, it is safe at that t.\n\nAnd y_{t+H} =9 for some H.\n\nMin H.\n\nSince from y=3 to y=9, min 6 steps, but we saw not possible, so H>=7.\n\nNow, to avoid the unsafe times.\n\nFor example, at t=8, Δt=5, many freeways unsafe.\n\nI should not be on y=4,5,6,7,8 at Δt=5.\n\nSimilarly at Δt=6, y=4,5,6,7 unsafe.\n\nBut y=8 safe at Δt=6.\n\ny=3 safe at Δt=5.\n\nSo possible to be at y=3 or y=8 at Δt=5.\n\nBut y=8 at Δt=5 unsafe, so only y=0,1,2,3,9 at Δt=5.\n\nSimilarly at Δt=6, y=0,1,2,3,8,9 safe.\n\nNow, let's start.\n\nAt t=3, Δt=0, y=3 safe.\n\nI can take U to y=4 at t=4.\n\nAt t=4, Δt=1, y=4: freeway 4 safe at Δt=1, yes.\n\nThen from here, I can take U to y=5 at t=5, Δt=2.\n\nAt t=5, Δt=2, y=5: freeway 5 safe at Δt=2, yes.\n\nThen take U to y=6 at t=6, Δt=3.\n\nAt t=6, Δt=3, y=6: freeway 6 safe at Δt=3, yes.\n\nNow at t=6, Δt=3, y=6 safe.\n\nNext, if I take U to y=7 at t=7, Δt=4.\n\nAt t=7, Δt=4, y=7: freeway 7 safe at Δt=4, yes.\n\nNow at t=7, Δt=4, y=7.\n\nNext turn t=8, Δt=5.\n\nIf I take U to y=8, then at t=8, Δt=5, y=8 unsafe.\n\nIf I take S, stay at y=7, at t=8, Δt=5, y=7 unsafe.\n\nIf I take D to y=6, at t=8, Δt=5, y=6 unsafe.\n\nAll bad.\n\nSo I need to be at a different y at t=8.\n\nAt t=7, Δt=4, y=7, I could take D to go down to y=6 at t=8, but unsafe.\n\nNot good.\n\nI should not be at y=7 at t=7.\n\nFor example, at t=6, Δt=3, y=6, instead of going up, I could go down or stay.\n\nBut I need to go up eventually.\n\nGo down to y=5 at t=7, Δt=4.\n\nAt t=7, Δt=4, y=5: freeway 5 safe at Δt=4, since unsafe only at 5,6, so Δt=4 safe.\n\nThen at t=7, y=5 safe.\n\nThen at t=8, Δt=5, I can take U to y=6, but at Δt=5, y=6 unsafe.\n\nTake S at y=5, unsafe at Δt=5.\n\nTake D to y=4, unsafe at Δt=5.\n\nAll unsafe at Δt=5.\n\nSo same issue.\n\nAt t=6, y=6, take D to y=5 at t=7, Δt=4, y=5 safe.\n\nThen at t=7, y=5, I can take D again to y=4 at t=8, Δt=5, but y=4 unsafe at Δt=5.\n\nNot good.\n\nOr take S, stay, unsafe.\n\nSo to avoid being on y=4-7 at Δt=5, I need to be at y<=3 or y=8 or 9 at Δt=5.\n\nBut y=8 unsafe at Δt=5, so only y=0,1,2,3,9.\n\ny=9 is target, but I am at lower y.\n\nSo possible to be at y=3 at Δt=5.\n\nFor example, at t=3, Δt=0, y=3, I can take S, stay at y=3 for multiple turns.\n\nBut that wastes time.\n\nOr go down to y=2, etc.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nStart: t=3, Δt=0, y=3 safe.\n\nTake S, stay at y=3 for t=4, Δt=1.\n\nAt t=4, Δt=1, y=3: freeway 3 unsafe at Δt=1,2, so at Δt=1, unsafe! Oh, freeway 3 unsafe at Δt=1 and 2.\n\nAt Δt=1, y=3 is unsafe.\n\nSo if I stay at t=4, I collide.\n\nTake U to y=4 at t=4, as before.\n\nOr take D to y=2 at t=4.\n\nAt t=4, Δt=1, y=2: freeway 2.\n\nFreeway 2 unsafe at Δt=1,2, so at Δt=1, unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, y=1 unsafe at Δt=1.\n\nSo at Δt=1, only safe freeways are y=4,5,6,7,8? y=4 safe at Δt=1, since unsafe only at 5,6.\n\ny=5,6,7 same.\n\ny=8 safe at Δt=1, since unsafe only at 3,4,5, so at 1 safe.\n\ny=0 and 9 safe.\n\nSo at Δt=1, safe to be on y=4,5,6,7,8.\n\nSimilarly at Δt=2, safe on y=4,5,6,7,8? y=4 safe at Δt=2, yes.\n\ny=1,2,3 unsafe at Δt=2.\n\ny=8 safe at Δt=2.\n\nBack to start.\n\nAt t=3, Δt=0, y=3 safe.\n\nI can take U to y=4 at t=4, Δt=1: safe.\n\nThen at t=4, y=4, Δt=1.\n\nNow, I need to be at y=3 or lower at t=8, Δt=5.\n\nBut from y=4, if I go down to y=3 at t=5, Δt=2.\n\nAt t=5, Δt=2, y=3: freeway 3 unsafe at Δt=2, so unsafe! Because unsafe at 1 and 2.\n\nSo at Δt=2, y=3 unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, if I go to y=2 or 1, also unsafe at Δt=2.\n\nSo at t=5, Δt=2, I cannot be on y=1,2,3.\n\nI can be on y=4,5,6,7,8.\n\nFor example, at t=4, y=4, I take S, stay at y=4 at t=5, Δt=2.\n\nAt t=5, Δt=2, y=4: freeway 4 safe at Δt=2, since unsafe only at 5,6, so safe.\n\nThen at t=5, y=4 safe.\n\nThen I can take U to y=5 at t=6, Δt=3.\n\nAt t=6, Δt=3, y=5: freeway 5 safe at Δt=3, yes.\n\nThen to y=6 at t=7, Δt=4.\n\nAt t=7, Δt=4, y=6: safe.\n\nThen to y=7 at t=8, Δt=5.\n\nAt t=8, Δt=5, y=7 unsafe.\n\nSame issue.\n\nFrom t=5, y=4, I can take U to y=5 at t=6, Δt=3: safe.\n\nThen from t=6, y=5, I can take U to y=6 at t=7, Δt=4: safe.\n\nThen at t=7, y=6, I can take U to y=7 at t=8, Δt=5: unsafe.\n\nOr I can stay at y=6 at t=8, Δt=5, unsafe.\n\nOr go down, unsafe.\n\nSo still problem at t=8, Δt=5.\n\nTo avoid, I need to be at y=8 at a safe time, like Δt=6.\n\nSo at Δt=6, I can be at y=8 or y=9.\n\nBut to be at y=8 at Δt=6, I need to come from y=7 at Δt=5 or y=9, but y=7 at Δt=5 unsafe, so I must be at y=7 at a safe time and go to y=8.\n\ny=7 safe at Δt=4, for example.\n\nAt Δt=4, I can be at y=7, then at Δt=5, I need to go to y=8 but unsafe, or stay unsafe, or go down unsafe.\n\nSo I can't be at y=7 at Δt=4 if I want to go to y=8 at Δt=6, because I have to pass through Δt=5.\n\nUnless I jump, but I can't.\n\nSo the only way is to be at y=7 at Δt=7 or something, but Δt=7 is late.\n\nLet's list the safe times for y=7: safe at Δt=0,1,2,3,4,7,8,9,...\n\nSimilarly for y=8: safe at Δt=0,1,2,6,7,8,9,...\n\nSo at Δt=4, y=7 safe, but at Δt=5, both y=7 and y=8 unsafe for different reasons.\n\nThen at Δt=6, y=7 unsafe, y=8 safe.\n\nSo to go from y=7 to y=8, I need to do it when both are safe or at the boundary.\n\nFor example, at Δt=4, y=7 safe, I can go to y=8 at Δt=5, but y=8 unsafe at 5.\n\nAt Δt=6, y=8 safe, but to be there, I need to come from y=7 at Δt=5, which is unsafe, or from y=9, not possible, or from y=8 at Δt=5, unsafe.\n\nSo the only possibility is to be at y=8 at Δt=2 or 1 or 0 or 6 or later.\n\nBut at Δt=0, I am at y=3, not 8.\n\nAt Δt=1, I can be at y=4, not 8.\n\nAt Δt=2, y=5, etc.\n\nSo earliest to be at y=8 is at Δt=5, but unsafe.\n\nNext safe at Δt=6.\n\nAt Δt=6, I can be at y=8.\n\nTo be at y=8 at Δt=6, I must be at y=7 at Δt=5 or y=9 or y=8 at Δt=5, but y=7 at Δt=5 unsafe, y=8 at Δt=5 unsafe, so impossible to be at y=8 at Δt=6 because I can't be at a predecessor at Δt=5.\n\nThe only predecessors are y=7, y=8, or y=9, but y=9 not predecessor for y=8.\n\nFrom y=7 at t, to y=8 at t+1.\n\nOr from y=8 stay.\n\nOr from y=9 down, but not likely.\n\nSo to be at y=8 at time t, I must have been at y=7, y=8, or y=9 at time t-1.\n\nBut at time t-1, if t corresponds to Δt=6, then t-1 is Δt=5.\n\nAt Δt=5, y=7 unsafe, y=8 unsafe, y=9 safe but if I am at y=9, I don't need to go to y=8.\n\nSo indeed, it is impossible to be at y=8 at Δt=6 because all possible previous positions at Δt=5 are either unsafe or not possible.\n\nSpecifically, if I am at y=8 at Δt=6, then at Δt=5, I was at some y such that I moved to y=8.\n\nIf I was at y=7 at Δt=5, then moved U to y=8 at Δt=6, but y=7 at Δt=5 unsafe.\n\nIf I was at y=8 at Δt=5, then moved S to y=8 at Δt=6, but y=8 at Δt=5 unsafe.\n\nIf I was at y=9 at Δt=5, moved D to y=8 at Δt=6, but at Δt=5, y=9 is safe, but if I am at y=9, I have reached, why go down?\n\nSo for reaching y=8, it must come from y=7 or itself, both unsafe at Δt=5.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to be at y=8 at Δt=6.\n\nSimilarly, at Δt=7, to be at y=8, I must come from y=7, y=8, or y=9 at Δt=6.\n\nAt Δt=6, y=7 unsafe, y=8 safe, y=9 safe.\n\nSo possible to be at y=8 at Δt=6 by staying from Δt=5, but y=8 unsafe at 5.\n\nOr from y=7 at Δt=6, but y=7 unsafe at 6.\n\nOr from y=9 at Δt=6, moved D.\n\nBut if at y=9, reached.\n\nSo to first reach y=8, it must be from y=7 or from below, but at Δt=6, y=7 unsafe, so only from y=8 at Δt=6 by staying, but to be at y=8 at Δt=6, I need to be there at Δt=5, impossible as above.\n\nAt Δt=7, I can be at y=8 from y=8 at Δt=6 or from y=7 at Δt=6 or from y=9.\n\nAt Δt=6, y=8 safe, so if I am at y=8 at Δt=6, I can stay to y=8 at Δt=7.\n\nOr from y=7 at Δt=6, but y=7 unsafe at 6, so I can't be there.\n\nOr from y=9 at Δt=6, moved D.\n\nBut again, if at y=9, reached.\n\nSo the only way to be at y=8 at Δt=7 is to be at y=8 at Δt=6.\n\nBut to be at y=8 at Δt=6, I need to be at y=8 at Δt=5 or y=7 at Δt=5, both impossible.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to be on freeway 8 at any time? That can't be right.\n\nLet's list when freeway 8 is safe: Δt=0,1,2,6,7,8,9,...\n\nAt Δt=0, I am at y=3, not 8.\n\nAt Δt=1, I can be at y=4, not 8.\n\nAt Δt=2, y=5, not 8.\n\nAt Δt=6, as above, impossible to be there because no way to arrive at that time without being unsafe at previous.\n\nBut at Δt=6, it is safe to be there, but how to get there.\n\nFor example, at Δt=2, I am at y=5, safe.\n\nThen I can go to y=6 at Δt=3, safe.\n\nThen to y=7 at Δt=4, safe.\n\nThen at Δt=4, y=7, I can go to y=8 at Δt=5, but unsafe.\n\nOr I can stay at y=7 at Δt=5, unsafe.\n\nOr go to y=6 at Δt=5, unsafe.\n\nSo no.\n\nFrom y=7 at Δt=4, I can go down to y=6 at Δt=5, unsafe.\n\nNot good.\n\nPerhaps go to y=8 earlier.\n\nAt Δt=0, y=3.\n\nGo U to y=4 at Δt=1.\n\nGo U to y=5 at Δt=2.\n\nThen at Δt=2, y=5, instead of going to y=6, go to y=6 at Δt=3.\n\nBut at Δt=3, y=6 safe.\n\nThen to y=7 at Δt=4, safe.\n\nThen to y=8 at Δt=5, unsafe.\n\nSame.\n\nOr from y=5 at Δt=2, go directly to y=8? Not possible.\n\nOr stay at y=5 for multiple turns.\n\nAt t=5, Δt=2, y=5 safe.\n\nTake S, stay at y=5 at t=6, Δt=3: safe.\n\nThen at t=6, Δt=3, y=5, take S to y=5 at t=7, Δt=4: safe.\n\nThen at t=7, Δt=4, y=5, take U to y=6 at t=8, Δt=5.\n\nAt t=8, Δt=5, y=6 unsafe.\n\nTake U to y=6 at t=7, Δt=4, y=6 safe.\n\nThen at t=7, y=6, take S to y=6 at t=8, Δt=5, unsafe.\n\nOr take U to y=7 at t=8, Δt=5, unsafe.\n\nOr take D to y=5 at t=8, unsafe.\n\nSo always unsafe at t=8, Δt=5 if on y=4-7.\n\nThe only escape is to be on y=3 or lower at t=8.\n\nBut how to get there from higher y.\n\nFor example, at t=7, Δt=4, I am at some y, say y=6, I can take D to y=5 at t=8, but unsafe.\n\nNot good.\n\nStart from lower.\n\nAt t=3, Δt=0, y=3, take D to y=2 at t=4, Δt=1.\n\nBut at t=4, Δt=1, y=2: freeway 2 unsafe at Δt=1, so unsafe.\n\nTake U to y=4 as before.\n\nOr take S at t=4, but y=3 unsafe at Δt=1.\n\nSo at Δt=1, I cannot be on y=1,2,3, so I must be on y=4,5,6,7,8 or 0,9.\n\nSimilarly at Δt=2, cannot be on y=1,2,3, so on y=4,5,6,7,8.\n\nAt Δt=5, cannot be on y=4,5,6,7,8, so must be on y=0,1,2,3,9.\n\nBut y=9 is target, so possible to be on y=3 at Δt=5.\n\nSo let's aim to be at y=3 at Δt=5.\n\nThen from there, go up to y=9.\n\nBut y=3 at Δt=5 is safe, as freeway 3 safe at Δt=5.\n\nThen I can go up.\n\nBut at Δt=5, t=8, y=3.\n\nThen from y=3, go to y=4 at t=9, Δt=6.\n\nAt Δt=6, y=4: freeway 4 unsafe at Δt=6? Freeway 4 unsafe at Δt=5,6, so at Δt=6, unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, y=5,6,7 unsafe at Δt=6.\n\ny=8 safe at Δt=6.\n\nBut from y=3, I go to y=4 at Δt=6, unsafe.\n\nGo to y=2, not up.\n\nSo how to go up from y=3 at Δt=5.\n\nAt t=8, Δt=5, y=3 safe.\n\nI can take U to y=4 at t=9, Δt=6.\n\nBut at t=9, Δt=6, y=4: freeway 4 unsafe at Δt=6, so collision.\n\nTake S, stay at y=3 at t=9, Δt=6: freeway 3 safe at Δt=6, since unsafe at 1,2,8,9, so at 6 safe.\n\nThen at t=9, Δt=6, y=3 safe.\n\nThen take U to y=4 at t=10, Δt=7.\n\nAt t=10, Δt=7, y=4: freeway 4 safe at Δt=7, since unsafe only at 5,6, so safe.\n\nThen to y=5 at t=11, Δt=8.\n\nAt t=11, Δt=8, y=5: freeway 5 unsafe at Δt=8? Freeway 5 unsafe at Δt=5,6, so at 8 safe? Δt=8 not in 5,6, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, to y=6 at t=12, Δt=9.\n\nAt t=12, Δt=9, y=6: freeway 6 unsafe at Δt=9? Freeway 6 unsafe at Δt=5,6, so at 9 safe.\n\nThen to y=7 at t=13, Δt=10.\n\nAt t=13, Δt=10, y=7: freeway 7 safe at Δt=10.\n\nThen to y=8 at t=14, Δt=11.\n\nAt t=14, Δt=11, y=8: freeway 8 safe at Δt=11.\n\nThen to y=9 at t=15, Δt=12.\n\nBut this is many turns, H=12 from start, but we can do better.\n\nFrom y=3 at Δt=5, t=8, I can go directly to higher if possible, but no.\n\nAnother idea: at Δt=6, I can be on y=8, which is safe.\n\nBut how to get to y=8 at Δt=6.\n\nAs before, difficult.\n\nPerhaps from y=3 at earlier time.\n\nLet's list the turns.\n\nTurn t=3, Δt=0, y=3 safe.\n\nAction: take U to y=4 at t=4, Δt=1.\n\nt=4, Δt=1, y=4 safe.\n\nNow, instead of going up, take D to y=3 at t=5, Δt=2.\n\nBut at t=5, Δt=2, y=3 unsafe, because freeway 3 unsafe at Δt=2.\n\nSo collision.\n\nTake S at y=4 at t=5, Δt=2: y=4 safe at Δt=2.\n\nThen at t=5, y=4 safe.\n\nThen take D to y=3 at t=6, Δt=3.\n\nAt t=6, Δt=3, y=3: freeway 3 safe at Δt=3, yes.\n\nThen at t=6, Δt=3, y=3 safe.\n\nThen I can take U to y=4 at t=7, Δt=4.\n\nAt t=7, Δt=4, y=4 safe.\n\nThen take U to y=5 at t=8, Δt=5.\n\nAt t=8, Δt=5, y=5: unsafe! Because freeway 5 unsafe at Δt=5.\n\nStill problem.\n\nFrom t=6, y=3, take U to y=4 at t=7, Δt=4, safe.\n\nThen at t=7, y=4, instead of U, take S to stay at y=4 at t=8, Δt=5.\n\nAt t=8, Δt=5, y=4 unsafe.\n\nTake D to y=3 at t=8, Δt=5.\n\nAt t=8, Δt=5, y=3 safe.\n\nYes!\n\nSo at t=8, Δt=5, y=3 safe.\n\nThen from there, I can go up.\n\nAt t=8, y=3, take U to y=4 at t=9, Δt=6.\n\nAt t=9, Δt=6, y=4: freeway 4 unsafe at Δt=6, so collision.\n\nNot good.\n\nAt t=8, y=3, take S to stay at y=3 at t=9, Δt=6.\n\nAt t=9, Δt=6, y=3: freeway 3 safe at Δt=6, yes.\n\nThen take U to y=4 at t=10, Δt=7.\n\nAt t=10, Δt=7, y=4 safe.\n\nThen to y=5 at t=11, Δt=8.\n\nAt t=11, Δt=8, y=5 safe.\n\nTo y=6 at t=12, Δt=9.\n\ny=6 safe at Δt=9.\n\nTo y=7 at t=13, Δt=10.\n\ny=7 safe.\n\nTo y=8 at t=14, Δt=11.\n\ny=8 safe.\n\nTo y=9 at t=15, Δt=12.\n\nBut H=12 turns from start, which is long.\n\nSince y=8 is safe at Δt=6, I can go to y=8 at Δt=6.\n\nAt Δt=6, t=9, y=8 safe.\n\nHow to get to y=8 at t=9, Δt=6.\n\nFrom t=8, Δt=5, I am at y=3, as above.\n\nFrom y=3 at t=8, Δt=5, I can take U to y=4 at t=9, Δt=6, but y=4 unsafe at Δt=6.\n\nNot good.\n\nFrom y=3 at t=8, take U to y=4 at t=9, unsafe.\n\nOr take S, stay, then at t=9, y=3, then U to y=4 at t=10, etc.\n\nBut to reach y=8 faster, from y=3 at t=8, it takes 5 steps to y=8, at t=13, etc.\n\nBut at Δt=6, t=9, I can be at y=8 if I come from y=7 at t=8, but y=7 at t=8, Δt=5 unsafe.\n\nOr from y=8 at t=8, unsafe.\n\nSo impossible to be at y=8 at Δt=6.\n\nSimilarly, at Δt=7, t=10, I can be at y=8.\n\nHow? From y=7 at t=9, Δt=6, but y=7 unsafe at Δt=6.\n\nOr from y=8 at t=9, Δt=6, but if I can be at y=8 at Δt=6, impossible.\n\nOr from y=9 at t=9, moved D.\n\nBut if at y=9, reached.\n\nSo at t=10, Δt=7, I can be at y=8 from y=8 at t=9, but to be at y=8 at t=9, need to be at Δt=6, impossible, or from y=7 at t=9, unsafe.\n\nSo only from y=9 at t=9, but then I don't need to be at y=8.\n\nFor the first time reaching y=8, it must be from y=7, at a time when y=7 is safe and y=8 is safe at the next turn.\n\nFor example, at Δt=2, y=7 safe, then to y=8 at Δt=3, but y=8 unsafe at Δt=3.\n\nAt Δt=7, y=7 safe, to y=8 at Δt=8, y=8 safe at Δt=8.\n\nYes.\n\nSo at Δt=7, I can be at y=7, safe, then take U to y=8 at Δt=8, safe.\n\nThen to y=9 at Δt=9.\n\nNow, how to get to y=7 at Δt=7.\n\nFrom start, at Δt=0, y=3.\n\nGo up to y=4 at Δt=1.\n\nTo y=5 at Δt=2.\n\nTo y=6 at Δt=3.\n\nTo y=7 at Δt=4.\n\nAt Δt=4, y=7 safe.\n\nThen I need to get to y=7 at Δt=7.\n\nFrom y=7 at Δt=4, I can stay or move, but at Δt=5, y=7 unsafe, so I have to leave or something.\n\nFrom y=7 at Δt=4, I can go down to lower y that is safe at Δt=5, like y=3.\n\nBut y=3 at Δt=5 is safe.\n\nSo from y=7 at Δt=4, take D to y=6 at Δt=5, but y=6 unsafe at Δt=5.\n\nTake D to y=5, unsafe.\n\nOnly way is to go directly to y=3, but not possible in one step.\n\nSo from y=7 at t=7, Δt=4, take multiple down.\n\nFor example, take D to y=6 at t=8, Δt=5, but unsafe.\n\nNot possible.\n\nAt Δt=4, y=7, take D to y=6 at Δt=5, unsafe, but I have to.\n\nSo no.\n\nPerhaps be at y=7 at Δt=7 directly.\n\nFrom start, with delays.\n\nAt t=3, Δt=0, y=3, take U to y=4 at t=4, Δt=1.\n\nTake U to y=5 at t=5, Δt=2.\n\nTake U to y=6 at t=6, Δt=3.\n\nNow at t=6, Δt=3, y=6, take S to stay at y=6 at t=7, Δt=4: safe.\n\nThen at t=7, y=6, take S to stay at y=6 at t=8, Δt=5: unsafe.\n\nTake U to y=7 at t=8, Δt=5: unsafe.\n\nTake D to y=5 at t=8, Δt=5: unsafe.\n\nAll bad.\n\nFrom t=6, y=6, take D to y=5 at t=7, Δt=4: safe.\n\nThen at t=7, y=5, take D to y=4 at t=8, Δt=5: unsafe.\n\nOr take S, unsafe.\n\nOr take U to y=6 at t=8, unsafe.\n\nNo.\n\nSo the only way is to be at a safe y at Δt=5, like y=3, and then go up after Δt=6.\n\nFor example, as in the long path.\n\nBut let's accept that and minimize from there.\n\nStart at t=3, Δt=0, y=3.\n\nTake U to y=4 at t=4, Δt=1.\n\nTake U to y=5 at t=5, Δt=2.\n\nTake U to y=6 at t=6, Δt=3.\n\nTake U to y=7 at t=7, Δt=4.\n\nNow at t=7, Δt=4, y=7, I need to go down to y=3 at t=8, but can't in one step.\n\nTake D to y=6 at t=8, Δt=5, but y=6 unsafe.\n\nCollision.\n\nSo not possible.\n\nAt t=6, Δt=3, y=6, take D to y=5 at t=7, Δt=4: safe.\n\nThen at t=7, y=5, take D to y=4 at t=8, Δt=5: unsafe.\n\nCollision.\n\nAt t=5, Δt=2, y=5, take D to y=4 at t=6, Δt=3: safe.\n\nThen at t=6, y=4, take D to y=3 at t=7, Δt=4: safe.\n\nAt t=7, Δt=4, y=3 safe.\n\nThen at t=7, y=3, I can take U to y=4 at t=8, Δt=5.\n\nBut at t=8, Δt=5, y=4 unsafe.\n\nTake S to stay at y=3 at t=8, Δt=5: safe.\n\nThen at t=8, y=3, take U to y=4 at t=9, Δt=6.\n\nBut at t=9, Δt=6, y=4 unsafe.\n\nTake S at y=3 at t=9, Δt=6: safe.\n\nThen take U to y=4 at t=10, Δt=7: safe.\n\nThen to y=5 at t=11, Δt=8: safe.\n\nTo y=6 at t=12, Δt=9: safe.\n\nTo y=7 at t=13, Δt=10: safe.\n\nTo y=8 at t=14, Δt=11: safe.\n\nTo y=9 at t=15, Δt=12.\n\nH=12 turns.\n\nBut at t=8, y=3, I can go directly to y=8 if possible, but not.\n\nSince y=8 is safe at Δt=6, and I am at y=3 at t=8, Δt=5, I can go to y=4 at t=9, Δt=6, but y=4 unsafe at 6.\n\nNot.\n\nOr from y=3 at t=8, go to y=2 at t=9, but y=2 at Δt=6: freeway 2 safe at Δt=6, since unsafe at 1,2,8,9, so at 6 safe.\n\nThen from y=2, go to y=3, etc., but slower.\n\nNot better.\n\nSo the fastest is to go up as far as possible before the unsafe period, then go down or stay low during unsafe, then go up after.\n\nFor example, go to y=7 at Δt=4, then during Δt=5,6, be on y=3 or lower, but how to get there.\n\nFrom y=7 at Δt=4, to y=3 at Δt=5, impossible.\n\nSo the best is to be at y=3 at Δt=5 by going down earlier.\n\nFrom start:\n\nt=3, Δt=0, y=3: take U to y=4 (action for turn 3)\n\nt=4, Δt=1, y=4: take U to y=5\n\nt=5, Δt=2, y=5: take D to y=4 (since at t=6, Δt=3, y=4 safe)\n\nAt t=5, Δt=2, y=5, take D, to y=4 at t=6, Δt=3.\n\nAt t=6, Δt=3, y=4: take D to y=3 at t=7, Δt=4.\n\nAt t=7, Δt=4, y=3: take S to stay at y=3 at t=8, Δt=5. (safe)\n\nThen at t=8, y=3: take U to y=4 at t=9, Δt=6.\n\nBut at t=9, Δt=6, y=4 unsafe.\n\nInstead, at t=8, y=3, take S to stay at y=3 at t=9, Δt=6: safe.\n\nThen at t=9, y=3: take U to y=4 at t=10, Δt=7: safe.\n\nThen U to y=5 at t=11, Δt=8: safe.\n\nU to y=6 at t=12, Δt=9: safe.\n\nU to y=7 at t=13, Δt=10: safe.\n\nU to y=8 at t=14, Δt=11: safe.\n\nU to y=9 at t=15, Δt=12.\n\nH=12.\n\nBut from t=9, y=3, I can go to y=8 faster, but no, because y=4 to y=7 are unsafe at Δt=6, but at Δt=7, they are safe.\n\nAt Δt=7, t=10, y=4 safe, etc.\n\nBut I have to go through each level.\n\nUnless I go directly, but can't.\n\nSo H=12 seems necessary, but let's see if I can reach y=9 sooner.\n\nFor example, at t=8, Δt=5, I am at y=3, safe.\n\nThen at t=9, Δt=6, I am at y=3, safe.\n\nThen at t=10, Δt=7, I go to y=4, safe.\n\nt=11, Δt=8, to y=5, safe.\n\nt=12, Δt=9, to y=6, safe.\n\nt=13, Δt=10, to y=7, safe.\n\nt=14, Δt=11, to y=8, safe.\n\nt=15, to y=9.\n\nBut at t=14, I am at y=8, then to y=9 at t=15.\n\nCan I be at y=8 earlier?\n\nFor example, at t=13, Δt=10, y=7, then to y=8 at t=14, Δt=11.\n\nBut at t=13, I am at y=7.\n\nHow to be at y=7 at t=13.\n\nFrom y=3 at t=9, to y=4 at t=10, y=5 at t=11, y=6 at t=12, y=7 at t=13.\n\nSo same as above.\n\nStart earlier up.\n\nAnother idea: at the beginning, stay at y=3 for more turns.\n\nAt t=3, y=3, take S to stay at y=3 at t=4, but at t=4, Δt=1, y=3 unsafe.\n\nSo cannot.\n\nTake U to y=4 at t=4, as before.\n\nOr take D to y=2 at t=4, but at t=4, Δt=1, y=2 unsafe.\n\nSo no.\n\nSo I think the minimal H is 12 turns.\n\nBut let's confirm the actions.\n\nTurn t=3: U to y=4\n\nTurn t=4: U to y=5\n\nTurn t=5: D to y=4  (at t=6, y=4)\n\nTurn t=6: D to y=3  (at t=7, y=3)\n\nTurn t=7: S to stay at y=3 (at t=8, y=3)\n\nTurn t=8: S to stay at y=3 (at t=9, y=3)\n\nTurn t=9: U to y=4 (at t=10, y=4) -- at t=10, Δt=7, y=4 safe\n\nTurn t=10: U to y=5 (t=11, y=5)\n\nTurn t=11: U to y=6 (t=12, y=6)\n\nTurn t=12: U to y=7 (t=13, y=7)\n\nTurn t=13: U to y=8 (t=14, y=8)\n\nTurn t=14: U to y=9 (t=15, y=9)\n\nH=12 turns from t=3 to t=14, actions from t=3 to t=14, 12 actions, reach at t=15? Let's see.\n\nStart at t=3, position after action.\n\nAt turn t, after action, position for next turn.\n\nClarify.\n\nAt turn T, player is at position y_T.\n\nThen chooses action a_T, which determines y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy.\n\nThen at turn T+1, player is at y_{T+1}, and so on.\n\nFor collision at turn T, check freeway y_T at time T.\n\nIn this case, at T=3, y_3=3, safe.\n\nTake action a_3, say U, so y_4 = 4.\n\nAt T=4, y_4=4, check freeway 4 at Δt=1, safe.\n\nTake action a_4, U, y_5=5.\n\nAt T=5, y_5=5, Δt=2, freeway 5 safe.\n\nTake a_5, D, so y_6=4.\n\nAt T=6, y_6=4, Δt=3, freeway 4 safe.\n\nTake a_6, D, so y_7=3.\n\nAt T=7, y_7=3, Δt=4, freeway 3 safe.\n\nTake a_7, S, so y_8=3.\n\nAt T=8, y_8=3, Δt=5, freeway 3 safe.\n\nTake a_8, S, so y_9=3.\n\nAt T=9, y_9=3, Δt=6, freeway 3 safe.\n\nTake a_9, U, so y_10=4.\n\nAt T=10, y_10=4, Δt=7, freeway 4 safe.\n\nTake a_10, U, y_11=5.\n\nAt T=11, y_11=5, Δt=8, freeway 5 safe.\n\nTake a_11, U, y_12=6.\n\nAt T=12, y_12=6, Δt=9, freeway 6 safe.\n\nTake a_12, U, y_13=7.\n\nAt T=13, y_13=7, Δt=10, freeway 7 safe.\n\nTake a_13, U, y_14=8.\n\nAt T=14, y_14=8, Δt=11, freeway 8 safe.\n\nTake a_14, U, y_15=9.\n\nAt T=15, y_15=9, reached.\n\nH=12 actions from t=3 to t=14, reach at t=15.\n\nBut the number of turns H is the number of actions to reach, so from t=3 to t=3+H-1, position at t=3+H.\n\nMinimal H.\n\nBut perhaps I can reach faster by going to y=8 at a safe time earlier.\n\nFor example, at Δt=2, t=5, I can be at y=5.\n\nIf I could be at y=8 at Δt=2, impossible.\n\nOr at Δt=7, t=10, y=8.\n\nHow to be at y=8 at t=10.\n\nFrom y=3 at t=3, need 5 steps up, so at t=8, y=8 if go up fast.\n\nBut at t=8, Δt=5, y=8 unsafe.\n\nAt t=9, Δt=6, impossible to be at y=8.\n\nAt t=10, Δt=7, y=8 possible if from y=7 at t=9 or y=8 at t=9.\n\nBut at t=9, Δt=6, y=7 unsafe, y=8 impossible.\n\nSo earliest at t=11, Δt=8, y=8.\n\nAt t=11, Δt=8, y=8 safe.\n\nHow to be at y=8 at t=11.\n\nFor example, from y=7 at t=10, Δt=7, y=7 safe, to y=8 at t=11, Δt=8, y=8 safe.\n\nThen to y=9 at t=12.\n\nNow, how to be at y=7 at t=10.\n\nFrom start, t=3, y=3 to y=7 in 4 steps: t=4 y=4, t=5 y=5, t=6 y=6, t=7 y=7.\n\nAt t=7, Δt=4, y=7 safe.\n\nThen from t=7, y=7, I need to be at y=7 at t=10, so I have to stay or move around.\n\nAt t=7, Δt=4, y=7, take S to y=7 at t=8, Δt=5, but unsafe.\n\nTake D to y=6 at t=8, unsafe.\n\nSo I can't stay at y=7.\n\nGo down to y=3 at some point.\n\nFor example, at t=7, y=7, take D to y=6 at t=8, unsafe.\n\nNot possible.\n\nSo to be at y=7 at t=10, I need to arrive at that time.\n\nFor example, from y=6 at t=9, to y=7 at t=10.\n\nBut at t=9, Δt=6, y=6 unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, so not possible.\n\nTherefore, the only way is to go down to y=3 during the unsafe period and then up.\n\nSo H=12 is the minimal.\n\nBut let's see if I can save one turn.\n\nSuppose at t=8, y=3, instead of staying, go to y=4 at t=9, but at t=9, Δt=6, y=4 unsafe.\n\nNot.\n\nOr at t=7, y=3, I go directly to y=8, impossible.\n\nSo I think H=12 is best.\n\nBut in the path above, from t=3 to t=14 actions, 12 actions, reach at t=15.\n\nBut the number of turns H is the number of actions, so H=12.\n\nFrom t=3 to t=3+H-1 actions, position at t=3+H.\n\nWith H=12, at t=15, y=9.\n\nPerhaps I can reach at t=14.\n\nAt t=14, y=9.\n\nThen at t=13, I need to be at y=8, and take U.\n\nAt t=13, y=8, Δt=10, safe.\n\nHow to be at y=8 at t=13.\n\nFrom t=3, in 10 turns? From t=3 to t=12 actions, position at t=13.\n\nActions from t=3 to t=12 for y from 3 to 8, 5 steps, so possible in 5 actions: t=3 U to y=4 at t=4, t=4 U to y=5 at t=5, ..., t=7 U to y=8 at t=8.\n\nBut at t=8, Δt=5, y=8 unsafe.\n\nAt t=9, impossible.\n\nAt t=10, Δt=7, y=8, but how to be there.\n\nFrom t=3, to y=8 at t=10, need 7 steps: t=3 to t=9 actions, position at t=10.\n\nActions: t=3 U to y=4, t=4 U to y=5, t=5 U to y=6, t=6 U to y=7, t=7 U to y=8 at t=8, but at t=8, Δt=5, y=8 unsafe.\n\nIf I delay, at t=6, y=6, take S to y=6 at t=7, then U to y=7 at t=8, unsafe.\n\nSo cannot reach y=8 before t=11.\n\nAt t=11, y=8, Δt=8, safe.\n\nThen to y=9 at t=12.\n\nBut at t=11, y=8, from where.\n\nFrom y=7 at t=10, to y=8 at t=11.\n\nAt t=10, y=7, Δt=7, safe.\n\nHow to be at y=7 at t=10.\n\nFrom t=3, to y=7 at t=10, position at t=10, so actions from t=3 to t=9.\n\n7 steps from y=3 to y=7, so actions t=3 U to y=4 t=4, t=4 U to y=5 t=5, t=5 U to y=6 t=6, t=6 U to y=7 t=7.\n\nAt t=7, y=7, Δt=4, safe.\n\nThen from t=7, I need to be at y=7 at t=10, so at t=7, y=7, take S to y=7 at t=8, but at t=8, Δt=5, y=7 unsafe.\n\nTake D to y=6 at t=8, unsafe.\n\nSo I cannot stay or move to y=7 at t=10 from here.\n\nGo down and come back.\n\nFor example, at t=7, y=7, take D to y=6 at t=8, unsafe.\n\nNot possible.\n\nSo to be at y=7 at t=10, I can come from y=6 at t=9 or y=7 at t=9 or y=8 at t=9.\n\nAt t=9, Δt=6, y=6 unsafe, y=7 unsafe, y=8 impossible.\n\nSo only from y=7 at t=9 by staying, but y=7 unsafe at t=9.\n\nSo impossible to be at y=7 at t=10.\n\nSimilarly, the earliest to be at y=7 after Δt=4 is at Δt=7, t=10.\n\nAt t=10, y=7, from y=6 at t=9, but at t=9, Δt=6, y=6 unsafe.\n\nOr from y=7 at t=9, unsafe.\n\nSo only from y=8 at t=9, moved D, but not.\n\nTherefore, impossible to be on y=7 at t=10.\n\nSimilarly for other levels.\n\nSo the path with H=12 is valid and minimal.\n\nNow, in the answer, I need to output the actions from t=3 to t=3+H-1 = t=14.\n\nH=12 turns, actions from t=3 to t=14.\n\nBut let's list the actions.\n\nFrom above:\n\nTurn t=3: U (to y=4)\n\nTurn t=4: U (to y=5)\n\nTurn t=5: D (to y=4)\n\nTurn t=6: D (to y=3)\n\nTurn t=7: S (stay y=3)\n\nTurn t=8: S (stay y=3)\n\nTurn t=9: U (to y=4)\n\nTurn t=10: U (to y=5)\n\nTurn t=11: U (to y=6)\n\nTurn t=12: U (to y=7)\n\nTurn t=13: U (to y=8)\n\nTurn t=14: U (to y=9)\n\nAt t=14, action U to y=9 at t=15.\n\nBut at t=15, position y=9, reached.\n\nThe sequence is for turns t=3 to t=14.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be actions for turns starting from t_1.\n\nSo for this case.\n\nBut in the down actions, I went to y=4 then down to y=3, but at t=5, I went D from y=5 to y=4, which is safe, etc.\n\nPerhaps I can avoid going down by staying at some point.\n\nFor example, at t=5, y=5, instead of D, take S to stay at y=5 at t=6, Δt=3, safe.\n\nThen at t=6, y=5, take S to stay at y=5 at t=7, Δt=4, safe.\n\nThen at t=7, y=5, take D to y=4 at t=8, Δt=5, unsafe.\n\nCollision.\n\nTake U to y=6 at t=8, unsafe.\n\nSo not better.\n\nTherefore, the path with down to y=3 and stay during unsafe period is fine.\n\nSo minimal H=12.\n\nNow, for the answer.\n\nCurrent turn t_1=3.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: D\n\nTurn 6: D\n\nTurn 7: S\n\nTurn 8: S\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nReach at turn 15.\n\nIn the sequence, last action at turn 14 to reach y=9 at turn 15.\n\nH=12 actions.\n\nBut let's confirm the collision points.\n\nAt each turn:\n\nT=3, Δt=0, y=3, safe\n\nT=4, Δt=1, y=4, safe\n\nT=5, Δt=2, y=5, safe\n\nT=6, Δt=3, y=4, safe (freeway 4 safe at Δt=3)\n\nT=7, Δt=4, y=3, safe\n\nT=8, Δt=5, y=3, safe\n\nT=9, Δt=6, y=3, safe (freeway 3 safe at Δt=6)\n\nT=10, Δt=7, y=4, safe\n\nT=11, Δt=8, y=5, safe\n\nT=12, Δt=9, y=6, safe\n\nT=13, Δt=10, y=7, safe\n\nT=14, Δt=11, y=8, safe\n\nThen at T=15, y=9, reached, no need to check.\n\nNo collision.\n\nAnd H=12.\n\nPerhaps I can reduce by one if I go to y=8 sooner, but as before, not possible.\n\nSo I think this is minimal.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 3)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 3\\) is 12.

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 6, and the player is at (0,3). The goal is to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on freeways 1 to 8 (which are the rows y=1 to y=8). Note that the player moves vertically (changing y-coordinate) and the cars move horizontally on their respective freeways (rows). The collision occurs only if at the turn T, the player is on a freeway y (which is between 1 and 8) and at that same turn T, the car on that freeway has a span that includes x=0.\n\nImportant note: When the player moves from y_T to y_{T+1} at turn T, at the moment of turn T, the player is still on row y_T. Then at turn T+1, the player is on row y_{T+1}. So when we are at turn T, we only check the freeway corresponding to y_T for collision.\n\nCar update: All cars are moving to the right (since direction is \"right\")? But note the representation:\n\nFor a right-moving car, the span at time t1 is [tau, h] (with tau <= h) and at time T, it becomes [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n\nHowever, looking at the data:\n\nFor freeway 1: \n  Car1: head=-30, tail=-41, direction=right, speed=6 -> but note: if it's right-moving, the head should be greater than the tail? But here head=-30 and tail=-41 -> so head > tail? Actually, -30 > -41, so the car is from -41 (tail) to -30 (head). Then when moving right, at time T, the car will be at [ -41 + 6*(T-6), -30 + 6*(T-6) ].\n\nSimilarly, the other cars on freeway 1: \n  (48,37,right,6): head=48, tail=37 -> so the car is from 37 to 48? Then at time T: [37+6*(T-6), 48+6*(T-6)]\n  (12,1,right,6): [1+6*(T-6), 12+6*(T-6)]\n\nBut note: at time t1=6, we have:\n  First car: [ -41 + 6*(0) = -41, -30] -> but wait, T-t1=0 at T=6, so [ -41, -30] (but that's 12 units long? Actually, from -41 to -30 is 12 units? -30 - (-41) = 11, so 12 units? Actually, the number of cells is 12? But note: the span is [a, b] inclusive? \n\nBut the problem says: collision occurs if 0 is in the span. So we need to check for each freeway the player is on at turn T, whether 0 is in any of the car spans on that freeway at turn T.\n\nWe are starting at turn 6, at (0,3). We need to get to (0,9). The player can move up (U: y+1), down (D: y-1), or stay (S: y same). We cannot go below 0 or above 9.\n\nWe are to find the minimal H (number of turns) and the sequence of actions from turn 6 to turn 6+H-1 such that at turn 6+H-1, y=9.\n\nNote: we start at y=3 at turn 6. So we must end at y=9 at turn (6+H-1). The minimal H would be at least 6 (because 3 to 9 is 6 steps up, but we can also take detours? but we want minimal, so we hope to go up as much as possible). However, we must avoid collisions.\n\nWe need to simulate the car positions at each future turn (relative to turn 6) and check for each turn and each freeway we are on whether there is a car covering x=0 at that turn.\n\nLet t = T - 6, so at our starting time, t=0.\n\nAt turn 6+T (where T>=0), the car on a freeway that was at (h, tau, d, s) at turn 6 will be:\n\nIf right-moving: span = [tau + s*T, h + s*T]   (since T = T - 6? actually T in our relative time is the number of turns after 6)\n\nSo for a car (h, tau, d, s) at turn 6, at relative time T (so absolute turn = 6+T), the span is:\n  if d == 'right': [tau + s*T, h + s*T]   (and note: tau <= h, so the tail is at tau and head at h, so the car extends from tau to h? but the problem says: at turn 6 the car is [h, tau] for left? and [tau, h] for right? \n\nWait, the problem states:\n\nFor a left-moving car: \n  initial: [h, tau] -> becomes [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\nFor right-moving: \n  initial: [tau, h] -> becomes [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut in the input, the cars are given as (head, tail, direction, speed). How to interpret?\n\nLooking at the data: \n  On freeway 1: (-30, -41, right, 6)\n\nSo for a right-moving car, the initial representation is (head, tail) = (-30, -41). But according to the update rule for right-moving, the initial span is [tau, h] = [-41, -30]. And then at time T, [ -41 + 6*T, -30 + 6*T ].\n\nSimilarly, the next car: (48,37,right,6): initial span [37,48]? Then at time T: [37+6*T, 48+6*T]\nBut wait: the problem says for right-moving: initial span is [tau, h] and the car moves right. But in the input, the tuple is (head, tail). So in the first car, head=-30, tail=-41 -> so tail=-41, head=-30. Then the initial span is [tail, head] = [-41, -30]. That matches.\n\nSo we can interpret the input for a car as (head, tail, direction, speed) as:\n  if direction is 'right', then the initial span is [tail, head] (and head>=tail).\n  if direction is 'left', then the initial span is [head, tail] (and head<=tail? but in the problem, for left it was [h, tau] and then h becomes the head? and we update by subtracting).\n\nBut in our problem, all cars are right-moving? Actually, the data only has 'right' in the current state. So we only have right-moving cars.\n\nSo for every car: at relative time T (from turn 6), the car's span is [tail + s*T, head + s*T].\n\nNow, we need to check for a given freeway i and relative time T, if the player is on freeway i at that time (i.e., y_{6+T} = i) then we must ensure that 0 is not in any car span on freeway i at relative time T.\n\nBut note: the freeway i has multiple cars. So we must check all cars on that freeway.\n\nWe are starting at y=3 at T=0 (absolute turn 6). We can choose actions: U, D, S.\n\nWe want the minimal number of turns. Since we have to go from 3 to 9, we need at least 6 moves (if we go up every time). But we must avoid the freeways at the times when we are on them if there is a car at x=0.\n\nWe can simulate the next few turns and check for collisions.\n\nWe'll plan to go up as much as possible, but if we see that at a future turn we would be on a freeway that has a car at x=0, then we might have to wait (S) or even go down? But going down would increase H, so we avoid if possible.\n\nWe'll simulate the car positions at each relative time T (starting from 0) and for each freeway we care about.\n\nFirst, let's list the cars per freeway and their movement:\n\nFreeway 1: three cars\n  car1: tail=-41, head=-30, s=6 -> span at T: [-41+6T, -30+6T]\n  car2: tail=37, head=48, s=6 -> [37+6T, 48+6T]\n  car3: tail=1, head=12, s=6 -> [1+6T, 12+6T]\n\nFreeway 2: same as freeway1? \n  The table says:\n  | 2 | (-30, -41, right, 6), (48, 37, right, 6), (12, 1, right, 6) |\n  But wait: the first car is (-30,-41) -> so tail=-41, head=-30? same as freeway1? \n  Actually, the table says for freeway2: \n      (-30, -41, right, 6), (48, 37, right, 6), (12, 1, right, 6)\n  So same as freeway1.\n\nFreeway 3: same.\n\nFreeway 4: \n  (-12, -23, right, 6) -> tail=-23, head=-12? -> [-23+6T, -12+6T]\n  (36,25,right,6) -> tail=25, head=36 -> [25+6T, 36+6T]\n\nFreeway 5: same as freeway4.\n\nFreeway 6: same as freeway4.\n\nFreeway 7: same as freeway4.\n\nFreeway 8: \n  (-40, -51, right, 4) -> tail=-51, head=-40 -> [-51+4T, -40+4T]\n  (36,25,right,4) -> [25+4T, 36+4T]\n  (0, -11, right, 4) -> tail=-11, head=0 -> [-11+4T, 0+4T] = [-11+4T, 4T]\n\nWe are starting at y=3 at T=0.\n\nWe need to go from y=3 to y=9. The direct path would be: \n  T0 (absolute turn 6): y=3 -> we are on freeway 3? But wait, the player is at (0,3) at turn 6. We must check freeway 3 at T=0.\n\nCheck freeway 3 at T=0:\n  Cars: same as freeway1? \n    car1: [-41, -30] -> 0 not in [-41,-30]? (since -30<0) -> no.\n    car2: [37,48] -> 0 not in [37,48] -> no.\n    car3: [1,12] -> 0 not in [1,12] -> no.\n\nSo we are safe at T=0 (turn6) at y=3.\n\nWe can then plan the next moves.\n\nWe want to minimize turns, so we prefer to go up. But we must check the next freeways at the time we are on them.\n\nWe'll simulate step by step:\n\nOption 1: always U until we hit 9.\n\nBut let's check the freeways we will step on:\n\nAt T0: y=3 -> safe.\n\nThen we do U: at T1 (turn7): y=4.\n\nWe are on freeway 4 at T1.\n\nCheck freeway4 at T=1:\n  car1: [-23+6*1, -12+6*1] = [-17, -6] -> 0 not in [-17,-6] -> safe.\n  car2: [25+6*1, 36+6*1] = [31,42] -> safe.\n\nThen T2 (turn8): y=5 -> freeway5 at T=2.\n  Freeway5 same as freeway4? \n    car1: [-23+12, -12+12] = [-11,0] -> now 0 is in [-11,0]? \n        The span is from -11 to 0 inclusive -> so 0 is included -> collision!\n\nSo at T=2 (absolute turn 8) if we are on freeway5, we collide.\n\nTherefore, we cannot be on freeway5 at T=2.\n\nSo we cannot go from y=4 at T1 to y=5 at T2? Because at T2 we are on freeway5 and there is a car covering 0.\n\nBut note: at T1 (turn7) we are at y=4. We could choose to not go up at T1? Or we could choose to go down? Or stay?\n\nBut we are at y=4 at T1. Then at T2, we can move to y=3 (down), y=4 (stay), or y=5 (up). But going up to y=5 causes collision.\n\nWhat about staying at y=4 at T2? Then we are on freeway4 at T2.\n\nCheck freeway4 at T=2:\n  car1: [-23+12, -12+12] = [-11,0] -> 0 is in [-11,0] -> collision! \n\nSo staying at y=4 at T2 is also not safe.\n\nWhat about going down to y=3 at T2? Then we are on freeway3 at T2.\n\nCheck freeway3 at T=2:\n  car1: [-41+12, -30+12] = [-29,-18] -> safe.\n  car2: [37+12,48+12]=[49,60] -> safe.\n  car3: [1+12,12+12]=[13,24] -> safe.\n\nSo going down to y=3 at T2 is safe.\n\nBut then we are back to y=3, and we have to go up again? That would take more turns.\n\nAlternatively, we might avoid freeway5 at T=2 by delaying our ascent.\n\nBut note: we must also avoid freeway4 at T=2 because it's unsafe. So at T2 we cannot be on y=4 or y=5? \n\nWe are at T1 at y=4. We must leave y=4 at T1? But at T1 we are already on y=4 and we are safe (as we saw for freeway4 at T1). Then at T2 we have to move to either y=3, y=4, or y=5. But y=4 and y=5 are unsafe at T2.\n\nSo the only safe move at T1 (from y=4) is to go down to y=3 at T2.\n\nBut then at T2 we are at y=3. Then we can try again to go up at T3.\n\nBut now we are at T2: y=3 (safe as above). Then T3: we can go to y=4.\n\nCheck freeway4 at T3 (relative time T=3):\n  car1: [-23+18, -12+18] = [-5,6] -> 0 is in [-5,6]? yes, because -5<=0<=6 -> collision.\n\nSo at T3, freeway4 is unsafe.\n\nThen we cannot go to y=4 at T3? \n\nAt T2 we are at y=3. We can also stay at y=3? Or go down to y=2? \n\nBut going down might be counterproductive.\n\nAlternatively, we might wait at y=3 until freeway4 is safe? \n\nCheck freeway4 at T=4:\n  car1: [-23+24, -12+24] = [1,12] -> 0 not in [1,12] -> safe? (but 0<1, so no)\n  car2: [25+24,36+24]=[49,60] -> safe.\n\nSo freeway4 is safe at T=4.\n\nSimilarly, what about freeway5? \n  At T=4: \n    car1: [-23+24, -12+24] = [1,12] -> safe.\n    car2: [25+24,36+24]=[49,60] -> safe.\n\nBut note: we are concerned with the time when we are on the freeway. \n\nSo plan:\n\nAt T0 (turn6): we are at y=3 (safe). We can choose to not move up immediately? \n\nBut we want minimal turns. We need to get to y=9. The direct path would take 6 moves. But we are already blocked at T2.\n\nAlternative plan:\n\nWe stay at y=3 for a few turns until the dangerous cars pass? \n\nBut note: at T=0: freeway3 is safe.\nAt T=1: freeway3: \n  car1: [-41+6, -30+6] = [-35,-24] -> safe.\n  car2: [37+6,48+6]=[43,54] -> safe.\n  car3: [1+6,12+6]=[7,18] -> safe.\n\nAt T=2: as above, safe.\n\nAt T=3: freeway3 at T=3:\n  car1: [-41+18, -30+18] = [-23,-12] -> safe (0 not in it)\n  car2: [37+18,48+18]=[55,66] -> safe.\n  car3: [1+18,12+18]=[19,30] -> safe.\n\nAt T=4: freeway3: \n  car1: [-41+24, -30+24] = [-17,-6] -> safe.\n  car2: [43+?] actually, at T=4: [37+24,48+24]=[61,72] -> safe.\n  car3: [1+24,12+24]=[25,36] -> safe.\n\nSo freeway3 is always safe? \n\nNow, we need to cross freeway4 and freeway5. We saw that freeway4 is unsafe at T=1? Actually, at T=1: freeway4 was safe (as above). But at T=2: unsafe, T=3: unsafe? \n\nFreeway4:\n  T=0: not checked because we start at y=3.\n  T=1: [-17,-6] (safe) and [31,42] (safe) -> safe.\n  T=2: [-11,0] -> unsafe (because 0 is included) and [37,48] -> unsafe due to first car.\n  T=3: [-5,6] -> unsafe (0 in [-5,6])\n  T=4: [1,12] -> safe (0 not in [1,12]) and [49,60] -> safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway5: same as freeway4? because the cars are identical? So same pattern.\n\nFreeway6: same as freeway4 -> same pattern.\n\nFreeway7: same.\n\nFreeway8: different.\n\nNow, we also have to go through freeway6,7,8 to get to 9.\n\nFreeway8 at time T:\n  car1: [-51+4T, -40+4T]\n  car2: [25+4T, 36+4T]\n  car3: [-11+4T, 4T]   [because the third car: tail=-11, head=0 -> becomes [-11+4T, 0+4T] = [-11+4T, 4T]\n\nWe need to avoid 0 in any of these at the time we are on freeway8.\n\nFor example, at time T:\n  car3: if -11+4T <= 0 <= 4T -> then unsafe.\n\nSolve: -11+4T <= 0 <= 4T -> \n  0 <= 4T -> T>=0 (always true for T>=0)\n  and -11+4T <= 0 -> 4T <= 11 -> T<=2.75 -> so T=0,1,2 are unsafe for car3? \n\nBut wait, at T=0: [-11,0] -> 0 is in it -> unsafe.\nT=1: [-7,4] -> 0 in [-7,4] -> unsafe.\nT=2: [-3,8] -> 0 in [-3,8] -> unsafe.\nT=3: [1,12] -> 0 not in [1,12] -> safe (for car3).\n\nBut also check other cars on freeway8 at T=3:\n  car1: [-51+12, -40+12] = [-39,-28] -> safe.\n  car2: [25+12,36+12]=[37,48] -> safe.\n\nSo freeway8 is safe at T>=3.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway4,5,6,7: safe at T>=4? Actually, at T=4: [1,12] -> safe.\n\nBut note: we are at T0 at y=3. We want to minimize H.\n\nWe can try to wait at y=3 until T=4? Then:\n\nAt T0 (turn6): y=3 -> safe (as we are).\nAt T1 (turn7): we can choose to stay at y=3? Then at T1: freeway3 -> safe (as above).\nAt T2 (turn8): stay at y=3 -> safe.\nAt T3 (turn9): stay at y=3 -> safe.\nAt T4 (turn10): now we can move up.\n\nBut we are at T4: we are at y=3. Then we do:\n  T4: move U to y=4 -> freeway4 at T4: safe (as above: [1,12] and [49,60] -> 0 not in [1,12] -> safe).\n  T5: move U to y=5 -> freeway5 at T5: \n        car1: [-23+6*5, -12+6*5] = [-23+30, -12+30] = [7,18] -> safe? (0 not in [7,18])\n        car2: [25+30,36+30]=[55,66] -> safe.\n  T6: move U to y=6 -> freeway6 at T6: same as freeway5? \n        car1: [7,18] -> safe? \n        car2: [55,66] -> safe.\n  T7: move U to y=7 -> freeway7 at T7: \n        car1: [-23+42, -12+42] = [19,30] -> safe.\n        car2: [25+42,36+42]=[67,78] -> safe.\n  T8: move U to y=8 -> freeway8 at T8: \n        We have T=8 (relative time from start) for freeway8?\n        car1: [-51+4*8, -40+4*8] = [-51+32, -40+32] = [-19,-8] -> safe.\n        car2: [25+32,36+32]=[57,68] -> safe.\n        car3: [-11+32, 32] = [21,32] -> safe.\n  T9: move U to y=9 -> we are done? But note: at y=9, there is no freeway? The freeways are y=1..8. So when we are at y=9, we are safe (no cars). And the goal is (0,9).\n\nBut note: when we move to y=9 at T9, at the turn T9 we are moving from y=8 to y=9. At turn T9, we start at y=8 and then move to y=9. So at turn T9, we are on freeway8? Then we must check freeway8 at T9.\n\nAt T9 (relative time 9) for freeway8:\n  car1: [-51+4*9, -40+4*9] = [-51+36, -40+36] = [-15,-4] -> safe.\n  car2: [25+36,36+36]=[61,72] -> safe.\n  car3: [-11+36, 4*9] = [25,36] -> safe.\n\nSo safe.\n\nThen the sequence would be:\n\nTurn6: S (stay at y=3)  [because we start at y=3, and we don't move at the first action? But note: the sequence of actions is for turns starting at t1=6. The first action a_{t1} is for turn6. At turn6, we are at y=3. We can choose an action. If we choose S, then y_{7}=y_6 +0 = 3. Then at turn7 we are at y=3.\n\nBut the problem: the sequence of actions is {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}. So the first action is at t1+0 = 6.\n\nSo at turn6: we do S -> then at turn7: we are still at y=3.\n\nThen turn7: S -> turn8: y=3.\nThen turn8: S -> turn9: y=3.\nThen turn9: S -> turn10: y=3. [we are at T4? Actually, at the start: T0 (turn6). Then after first action (turn6) we are at turn7 (T1). Then after turn7 action: turn8 (T2). Then turn8 action: turn9 (T3). Then turn9 action: turn10 (T4). Then at T4 (turn10) we do U -> so at turn11: y=4? \n\nBut note: the relative time T is the number of turns after the start? Actually, at turn6 (start) we are at T0. Then after an action at turn6, we get to turn7 which is T1. So:\n\n  Turn6 (T0): we start at y=3. Then we take action a6 -> then at turn7 (T1) we are at y = 3 + delta(a6).\n\nIn our plan, we want to stay at y=3 for 4 turns? Meaning we do S for 4 consecutive actions? Then:\n\n  a6 = S -> at turn7: y=3 (T1)\n  a7 = S -> at turn8: y=3 (T2)\n  a8 = S -> at turn9: y=3 (T3)\n  a9 = S -> at turn10: y=3 (T4)\n\nThen at T4 (turn10) we do:\n  a10 = U -> at turn11: y=4 (T5) [because we are at turn10: we are at y=3, then we do U, so next state y=4 at turn11.\n\nBut then we continue:\n\n  a11 = U -> turn12: y=5 (T6)\n  a12 = U -> turn13: y=6 (T7)\n  a13 = U -> turn14: y=7 (T8)\n  a14 = U -> turn15: y=8 (T9)\n  a15 = U -> turn16: y=9 (T10)\n\nBut at the turn we move to y=9 (turn16), we are at T10? \n\nBut note: we must end at turn (6+H-1) at y=9. The number of actions is H, and the last action leads to the state at turn 6+H-1.\n\nWe have actions from turn6 to turn16? That is 11 actions? (turns: 6,7,8,...,16 -> 11 turns). So H=11? \n\nBut we started at turn6 and ended at turn16: that's 11 turns? The states: \n  turn6: y=3 (start)\n  after a6 (at turn6): state at turn7: y=3\n  ... \n  after a15 (at turn15): state at turn16: y=9.\n\nSo the last action is at turn15, and we get to y=9 at turn16. So the sequence of actions is from turn6 to turn15 (10 actions)? \n\nWait: the sequence is for t=0 to H-1: \n  a_{t1+0} = a6\n  a_{t1+1} = a7\n  ...\n  a_{t1+H-1} = a_{6+H-1}\n\nAnd we require that at the state after the last action (i.e., at turn t1+H) we are at y=9? \n\nBut the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and then \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\nNote: the state update: after action a_t, we get state at t+1.\n\nSo we have:\n  At turn t1: state is (0,y0) = (0,3)\n  After action a_{t1} (t=0), we get state at turn t1+1: y1 = y0 + delta(a_{t1})\n  ...\n  After action a_{t1+H-1}, we get state at turn t1+H: y_{t1+H} = y_{t1+H-1} + delta(a_{t1+H-1})\n\nAnd we require that at turn t1+H, the position is (0,9). \n\nBut the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\"? \n\nRe-read: \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence ... to reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\"\n\nBut in the problem statement: \n  \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0, 9) at turn t_1 + H - 1\"\n\nSo at turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9).\n\nBut note the state update: \n  At turn t, we are at state (0, y_t). Then we choose action a_t, and then we move to state (0, y_{t+1}) at turn t+1.\n\nSo to be at (0,9) at turn T, we must have that the action at turn T-1 leads to y_T = 9.\n\nTherefore, we require that at turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9). \n\nThis means that the last action is taken at turn t1+H-2? \n\nWait, let me index:\n\nTurn: t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\nWe have actions: \n  a_{t1} (for turn t1) -> leads to state at turn t1+1: y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + delta(a_{t1})\n  ...\n  a_{t1+H-2} (for turn t1+H-2) -> leads to state at turn t1+H-1: y_{t1+H-1} = y_{t1+H-2} + delta(a_{t1+H-2})\n\nBut we want y_{t1+H-1} = 9.\n\nSo the last action is a_{t1+H-2}. Therefore, the sequence of actions is from t1 to t1+H-2? But the problem says the sequence is {a_{t1+t} for t=0 to H-1}. \n\nThis implies that the sequence has H actions? And the last action is at turn t1+H-1? Then the state after the last action is at turn t1+H. But we want the state at turn t1+H-1 to be 9? \n\nThere seems to be an inconsistency.\n\nRe-read the problem: \n  \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" \n  and then \"reach (0,9) at turn t_1+H-1\"\n\nBut the state at turn t1+H-1 is the result of the action taken at turn t1+H-2? \n\nAlternatively, the problem might be defining the actions as occurring at the same turn as the state? \n\nLooking at the update: \n  \"y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t\", and the action a_t is taken at turn t.\n\nSo the state at the beginning of turn t is (0, y_t). Then we take action a_t, and then we get state at turn t+1: y_{t+1}.\n\nTherefore, the state at turn t1 is given: (0,3). Then we take an action a_{t1} at turn t1, and then we get state at turn t1+1: y_{t1+1}.\n\nWe want that at turn t1+H-1, the state is (0,9). \n\nSo we require that after H-1 actions, we are at turn t1+H-1? \n\nThe actions are taken at turns: t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-2 (total of H-1 actions) and then at turn t1+H-1 we are at y=9.\n\nBut the problem says: the sequence is for t=0 to H-1, meaning H actions? \n\nThis is confusing.\n\nCheck the problem: \n  \"sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\"\n\nThat means we have actions at turns: t1+0, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1? So H actions? \n\nBut then the state after the last action (at turn t1+H-1) would be at turn t1+H. \n\nBut we want to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1? \n\nThis does not match.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might mean that we take the action at the turn and then immediately the state is updated? \n\nBut the update rule says: y_{t+1} = ... meaning the state at the next turn.\n\nI think there is a misunderstanding.\n\nLooking at the problem: \"reach (0, 9) at turn t_1 + H - 1\"\n\nAnd the sequence is for actions from t1 to t1+H-1? \n\nBut if we take H actions, then we will be at turn t1+H after the last action.\n\nBut we want to be at turn t1+H-1 at (0,9). \n\nSo we must have taken H-1 actions? \n\nBut the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\" and the sequence has H actions? \n\nPerhaps \"turns\" here refers to the number of time steps? \n\nAnother possibility: the game starts at turn t1, and we take an action at every turn until we reach. The total number of turns we play is H, meaning we take actions at H consecutive turns: from t1 to t1+H-1, and then at the end of the last action (at turn t1+H-1), we are at (0,9). \n\nBut that would mean the state at turn t1+H-1 is (0,9). \n\nBut how is that achieved? \n\nAt the start of turn t1, we are at (0,3). Then we take action a_{t1} -> then at turn t1+1, we are at y_{t1+1} = 3 + delta(a_{t1}).\n\nWe want that at turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9). \n\nSo the state at the start of turn t1+H-1 is y_{t1+H-1}. Then we do not take an action at that turn? \n\nBut the sequence includes an action for turn t1+H-1? \n\nThis is messy.\n\nLet me try with a small example.\n\nSuppose we are at turn0 at y0=3, and we want to get to y=4 at turn1? Then we take one action: at turn0, we do U, and then at turn1 we are at y=4.\n\nWe want to be at (0,4) at turn1. Then H should be 2? because we take one action at turn0? and then we are at turn1.\n\nBut the problem says: \n  \"minimal number of turns H\" \n  and we reach at turn t1+H-1.\n\nIn this case, if t1=0, then we want to be at turn0+H-1 = 1 -> so H-1=1 -> H=2.\n\nAnd the sequence has H=2 actions? but we only took one action.\n\nThe problem says: the sequence is for t=0 to H-1: so two actions? \n\nThat doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might be counting the state turns? \n\nI think there is a misinterpretation.\n\nLooking at the answer format: \n  Turn t1: a_{t1}\n  Turn t1+1: a_{t1+1}\n  ...\n\nuntil we have H lines.\n\nAnd we want that at turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9). \n\nBut if we have H actions, then we have actions at turns: t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1. \n\nThen the state after the last action (at turn t1+H-1) is at turn t1+H.\n\nBut we want to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1, which is before the last action? \n\nThat doesn't make sense.\n\nUnless the state at turn t1+H-1 is the state BEFORE the action of that turn.\n\nBut the problem states: \"current turn is t1\" and the position is given at turn t1.\n\nThen after action a_{t1}, we are at turn t1+1.\n\nSo the state at turn t1 is the starting state, and then we take actions at turns t1, t1+1, ... and the state evolves at turns t1+1, t1+2, ...\n\nWe want the state at turn t1+k to be (0,9) for some k.\n\nThe problem says: at turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9). \n\nSo k = H-1.\n\nAnd the number of actions to get from turn t1 to turn t1+H-1 is (H-1) actions? \n\nBut the sequence is specified as H actions? \n\nThis is confusing.\n\nPerhaps the \"turns\" in H is the number of actions? Then after H actions, we are at turn t1+H, and we want to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1? That doesn't work.\n\nI think there might be a off-by-one in the problem statement.\n\nLet me read carefully: \"minimal number of turns H\" and \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\".\n\nAnd the sequence of actions is for turns: t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\nBut then the state after the action at turn t1+H-1 is at turn t1+H.\n\nSo to have the state at turn t1+H-1 be (0,9), it must be that we didn't take an action at turn t1+H-1? \n\nThis is not matching.\n\nUnless the action at turn t is taken at the end of turn t, and then the state at turn t is already set to the new state? \n\nBut the update rule is written as: y_{t+1} = y_t + ... which suggests that the state at turn t+1 is updated from the state at turn t and action at turn t.\n\nI think the intended meaning is:\n\n- At turn t, the player is at state (0, y_t).\n- The player chooses action a_t.\n- Then the state for turn t+1 is computed.\n\nWe want that at turn t1+H-1, the player is at (0,9). \n\nHow many actions have been taken to get there? \n\nFrom turn t1 to turn t1+H-1, there are (H-1) actions: actions at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-2.\n\nBecause the action at turn t1 sets the state for turn t1+1, and the action at turn t1+H-2 sets the state for turn t1+H-1.\n\nTherefore, the sequence of actions should be for turns: t1 to t1+H-2, which is H-1 actions.\n\nBut the problem says: the sequence is {a_{t1+t} for t=0 to H-1, which would be H actions? \n\nThis is a contradiction.\n\nPerhaps the problem means that H is the number of actions, and the state after the last action (at turn t1+H-1) is at turn t1+H, and we want that state to be (0,9), but then the turn we reach is t1+H, not t1+H-1.\n\nThe problem explicitly says: \"at turn t1+H-1\".\n\nAnother possibility: the \"turns\" in H count the number of state turns after the initial state? \n\nI think the safest is to assume that the sequence of actions has to be such that after the actions, we are at (0,9) at the turn corresponding to the last action's next state.\n\nBut the problem says \"at turn t1+H-1\", so we must output accordingly.\n\nMaybe the initial state at turn t1 is not counted in the actions? \n\nLet me try to see the minimal example: \n  Start at turn6 at (0,3). We want to be at (0,9) at turn6 (H=1)? Then we are already there? But we are at 3, not 9.\n\nIf we do one action: at turn6 we do U, then at turn7 we are at 4. So to be at 9, we need more.\n\nSuppose we do 6 actions: \n  turn6: U -> turn7:4\n  turn7: U -> turn8:5\n  turn8: U -> turn9:6\n  turn9: U -> turn10:7\n  turn10: U -> turn11:8\n  turn11: U -> turn12:9\n\nThen at turn12, we are at 9. This is after 6 actions (at turns6 to turn11). The number of actions is 6.\n\nThe turn we reach is turn12 = t1+6 (since t1=6, 6+6=12). We want to be at turn t1+H-1 = 6+H-1.\n\nSo 6+H-1 = 12 -> H-1 = 6 -> H=7.\n\nAnd the sequence has H=7 actions? But we only did 6 actions.\n\nThis suggests that H is the number of turns including the starting turn? But then we are not taking an action on the last turn.\n\nGiven the confusion, I will assume that the sequence of actions is for turns: t1 to t1+H-1, and after these H actions, the state at turn t1+H is (0,9). But the problem says turn t1+H-1.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might have a typo, and it should be turn t1+H.\n\nIn the answer format, we are to write actions for turns: t1, t1+1, ... until the last action that brings us to y=9.\n\nAnd H is the number of actions.\n\nAnd we want the minimal number of actions such that the state at turn t1+H is (0,9).\n\nAnd the turn we reach is turn t1+H.\n\nThen in the example above, H=6, and the last state is at turn6+6=12.\n\nBut the problem says \"at turn t1+H-1\", which would be turn11, not turn12.\n\nThis is off by one.\n\nGiven the time, I will assume that the intended meaning is: \n  We take actions at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1 (H actions), and then the state at turn t1+H is (0,9).\n\nAnd the turn we reach is turn t1+H.\n\nAnd we hope that the problem's \"t1+H-1\" is a typo and should be \"t1+H\".\n\nOtherwise, we cannot resolve.\n\nSo in our plan above, we had:\n\nActions:\n  turn6: S\n  turn7: S\n  turn8: S\n  turn9: S\n  turn10: U\n  turn11: U\n  turn12: U\n  turn13: U\n  turn14: U\n  turn15: U\n\nThen at turn16, we are at y=9.\n\nSo that's 10 actions: from turn6 to turn15.\n\nThen H=10, and turn reached = 6+10 = 16.\n\nBut if the problem wants at turn t1+H-1 = 6+10-1=15, then we would be at y=8 at turn15, and then we need one more action to get to 9 at turn16.\n\nBut the problem says we must be at (0,9) at turn15.\n\nSo then we would need to be at y=9 at turn15.\n\nIn our simulation, how to get to y=9 at turn15? \n\nWe start at turn6: y=3.\n\nWe need to go up 6 steps, so we need 6 ups, and possibly some delays.\n\nWith 6 ups and 4 stays, we would have 10 actions and be at turn16 for state y=9.\n\nTo be at y=9 at turn15, we need to have taken 9 actions? because from turn6 to turn15 there are 10 states: \n  turn6: state1 (y=3)\n  turn7: state2\n  ...\n  turn15: state10\n\nWe start at state1 at turn6. After 9 actions (at turns6 to turn14), we are at state10 at turn15.\n\nWe want state10 to be y=9.\n\nSo we need to go from y=3 to y=9 in 9 actions? meaning 6 ups and 3 stays.\n\nIn our earlier safe plan, we waited 4 stays? now we only have 3 stays.\n\nCan we do it in 9 actions (6 ups and 3 stays)?\n\nWe would be at y=3 for 3 extra turns? then go up.\n\nBut we saw that we must avoid freeway4 and freeway5 at T=2 and T=3? \n\nLet me redefine relative time T as the number of turns after turn6. So at turn6, T=0; turn7, T=1; ... turn15, T=9.\n\nWe start at T0: y=3.\n\nWe do 3 stays: \n  a6=S: T1: y=3\n  a7=S: T2: y=3\n  a8=S: T3: y=3\n\nThen we do 6 ups:\n  a9=U: T4: y=4\n  a10=U: T5: y=5\n  a11=U: T6: y=6\n  a12=U: T7: y=7\n  a13=U: T8: y=8\n  a14=U: T9: y=9\n\nSo at turn15 (T9), we are at y=9.\n\nNow, check collisions:\n\nAt T0 (turn6): y=3 -> safe.\nAt T1 (turn7): y=3 -> safe.\nAt T2 (turn8): y=3 -> safe.\nAt T3 (turn9): y=3 -> safe.\nAt T4 (turn10): y=4 -> freeway4 at T=4: [1,12] (car1) and [49,60] (car2) -> 0 not in [1,12] -> safe.\nAt T5 (turn11): y=5 -> freeway5 at T=5: \n        car1: [-23+6*5, -12+6*5] = [-23+30, -12+30] = [7,18] -> safe.\n        car2: [25+30,36+30]=[55,66] -> safe.\nAt T6 (turn12): y=6 -> freeway6 at T=6: \n        car1: [-23+36, -12+36] = [13,24] -> safe.\n        car2: [25+36,36+36]=[61,72] -> safe.\nAt T7 (turn13): y=7 -> freeway7 at T=7: \n        car1: [-23+42, -12+42] = [19,30] -> safe.\n        car2: [25+42,36+42]=[67,78] -> safe.\nAt T8 (turn14): y=8 -> freeway8 at T=8: \n        car1: [-51+4*8, -40+4*8] = [-51+32, -40+32] = [-19,-8] -> safe.\n        car2: [25+32,36+32]=[57,68] -> safe.\n        car3: [-11+32, 4*8] = [21,32] -> safe.\nAt T9 (turn15): y=9 -> no freeway, safe.\n\nSo this works, and we are at y=9 at turn15 = t1+9 (since 6+9=15), and H-1=9? -> H=10? \n\nBut the problem says: at turn t1+H-1 = 6+H-1 = 15 -> so H-1=9 -> H=10.\n\nAnd the sequence has H=10 actions: from turn6 to turn6+9=15? \n\nBut in the above, we have actions from turn6 to turn14? that's 9 actions. \n\n turn6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14 -> 9 actions.\n\nThen at turn15, we are at y=9, but we haven't taken an action at turn15? and the sequence should be for turns t1 to t1+H-1 = turn6 to turn6+9 = turn15? \n\nSo we need an action at turn15? \n\nBut after turn15, we would be at turn16. We don't want that.\n\nThis is the confusion.\n\nIn the above simulation, the last action is at turn14 (a14=U) which brings us to y=9 at turn15.\n\n So the sequence of actions is for turns: 6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14 -> 9 actions.\n\n Then H should be 9? and turn t1+H-1 = 6+9-1 = 14, but we are at y=9 at turn15, not turn14.\n\nSo to be at y=9 at turn14, we would need to have arrived there by the action at turn13.\n\n then we need to be at y=9 at turn14.\n\n from y=3 to y=9 in 8 actions? (6 ups and 2 stays).\n\nLet me try with 8 actions: 6 ups and 2 stays.\n\nWe can use the two stays to wait at safe times.\n\n  a6=S: T1: y=3\n  a7=S: T2: y=3\n  a8=U: T3: y=4  [T=3: freeway4 unsafe? as we saw at T=3: [-5,6] -> unsafe]\n  --> collision.\n\n a6=U: T1: y=4 (safe at T1 for freeway4)\n a7=S: T2: y=4 ( but at T2, freeway4: [-11,0] -> unsafe)\n\n a6=U: T1: y=4 (safe)\n a7=D: T2: y=3 (safe)\n a8=U: T3: y=4 (freeway4 at T3: unsafe [-5,6])\n\n a6=S: T1: y=3\n a7=U: T2: y=4 (freeway4 at T2: unsafe) -> collision.\n\n a6=U: T1: y=4 (safe)\n a7=U: T2: y=5 (freeway5 at T2: unsafe) -> collision.\n\nSo it seems we cannot do it in 8 actions.\n\nWe need to wait until at least T=4 to be on freeway4.\n\nSo the earliest we can be at y=4 is at T=4.\n\n then to y=9, we need 5 more ups, so earliest at T=9.\n\n But T=9 corresponds to turn6+9=15.\n\n So we need to be at turn15 for y=9.\n\nTherefore, the sequence must be 9 actions: from turn6 to turn14, and state at turn15 is y=9.\n\n Then in the problem's requirement: we want to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1.\n\n Here, turn15 = 6+H-1 -> 6+H-1=15 -> H-1=9 -> H=10.\n\n So the sequence has H=10 actions: for turns 6 to 15? \n\n But then the last action at turn15 would produce state at turn16.\n\n We don't want that.\n\n Given the above, I think the problem likely has a off-by-one in the turn index.\n\n or in the answer, they might only want the actions until we reach, and the last action is the one that caused the reach.\n\n So in our safe plan with 9 actions (6 ups and 3 stays), we reach at turn15.\n\n So the sequence is for turns 6 to 14 (9 actions), and H=9.\n\n then turn reached = 6+9 = 15 = turn15.\n\n and the problem's \" turn t1+H-1\" would be 6+9-1=14, but we are not at 9 at turn14.\n\n So not matching.\n\n We must output for H=10 actions even if we only took 9? \n\n This is very confusing.\n\n Given the time, I will output the actions for turns 6 to 14 (9 actions) and state reaches 9 at turn15.\n\n But the problem asks for the sequence in the format with H actions for turns t1 to t1+H-1.\n\n and we want to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1.\n\n So if we output 9 actions, then H=9, and turn t1+H-1 = 6+8=14.\n\n But at turn14, in our simulation, we are at y=8.\n\n So not done.\n\n Therefore, we must include one more action.\n\n At turn14: we are at y=8. then we do U: a14=U -> turn15: y=9.\n\n So then the sequence has 10 actions: turns6 to turn15.\n\n Then H=10.\n\n turn t1+H-1 = 6+10-1 = 15, and at turn15, we are at y=9? \n\n But the state at turn15 is the state AFTER the action at turn14. \n The action at turn15 would be the 10th action, and then state at turn16.\n\n But in the sequence, the last action is a_{t1+9} = a_{15} (turn15).\n\n then after a15, state at turn16.\n\n But we want state at turn15 to be 9.\n\n So the action at turn14 (which is the 9th action) brings us to turn15 with y=9.\n\n Therefore, the sequence should include actions only until turn14.\n\n So the number of actions is 9, and we output for turns 6 to 14.\n\n then H=9, and turn t1+H-1 = 6+8=14, but we are at state turn15 for y=9, not turn14.\n\n How about we consider that the state at turn t is before the action. Then at turn14, before any action, we are at y=8. then we do action U, and then at the same turn, we are at y=9? \n\n The update rule does not allow that.\n\n The update rule: y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta, so it is for the next turn.\n\nGiven the above, I think the intended meaning in the problem is that the sequence of actions has H actions, and the state at turn t1+H is (0,9). \n\nAnd the turn mentioned in the problem \" turn t1+H-1\" is a typo and should be turn t1+H.\n\n Therefore, I will output the sequence for our safe plan of 9 actions, and state reaches (0,9) at turn15 = t1+9, so H=9 actions, and we output for turns 6 to 14.\n\n Then in the answer, H=9, and the actions are for turns 6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14.\n\n But the problem's format requires to put in a box the actions from turn6 to turn6+8=14.\n\n And assume that at turn15 we are at 9.\n\n To match the problem's requirement, we would need to have at turn14 ( after the last action) the state at turn15 is 9.\n\n So it's as per the update rule.\n\n Therefore, in the answer, we write:\n\n Turn 6: S\n Turn 7: S\n Turn 8: S\n Turn 9: S  [ but wait, in our faster plan we only did 3 stays? then 6 ups]\n\n In the faster plan with 9 actions (3 stays and 6 ups), the actions are:\n\n  turn6: S\n  turn7: S\n  turn8: S\n  turn9: U\n  turn10: U\n  turn11: U\n  turn12: U\n  turn13: U\n  turn14: U\n\n Then at turn15: y=9.\n\n So the sequence of actions is for turns 6 to 14 (9 actions).\n\n And we are at (0,9) at turn15 = t1+9.\n\n If the problem insists on turn t1+H-1=6+9-1=14, then we are at y=8 at turn14, not 9.\n\n So we must output for turn15 we are at 9, but the action at turn14 brings us there.\n\n Therefore, I think the problem has a mistake, or we need to output with H=10 including an extra action.\n\n But in the extra action, if we do U at turn14, then at turn15 we are at 9, so we can output:\n\n actions from turn6 to turn14: 9 actions, and then at turn15 we are at 9.\n\n But the problem's answer format only has the actions, and we have 9 actions.\n\n And the minimal turns H=9.\n\n So in the box, we put:\n\n Turn 6: S\n Turn 7: S\n Turn 8: S\n Turn 9: U\n Turn 10: U\n Turn 11: U\n Turn 12: U\n Turn 13: U\n Turn 14: U\n\n And H=9.\n\n Then the last action is at turn14, and at turn15 we are at 9.\n\n But the problem says \" at turn t1+H-1\", which is turn6+9-1=14, but we are at (0,8) at turn14 (before the action) and then after the action at turn14, at turn15 we are at 9.\n\n So the state at turn14 is not 9.\n\n To have state at turn14 be 9, we would have to have gotten there by the action at turn13.\n\n then we need to be at y=9 at turn14.\n\n from y=3 to y=9 in 8 actions? we saw it's not safe.\n\n Therefore, I think the problem likely means the state after the actions are taken, at the turn following the last action.\n\n Given the above, I will output the 9-action sequence.\n\n So the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 6: S\nTurn 7: S\nTurn 8: S\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: U\n}\n\n With H=9.\n\n But note: at turn9: when we do U, we are at T=3 ( turn9 - turn6 = 3) for the action, and then at turn10 (T=4) we are at y=4.\n\n which is safe.\n\n We have to ensure that at the turns we are on the freeways, it is safe.\n\n We did the checks above.\n\n So this should be correct.\n\n To be sure, let's list the state at each turn after the action:\n\n turn6: action S -> state at turn7: y=3 ( safe at turn7: freeway3 at T=1 -> cars: [-35,-24], [43,54], [7,18] -> safe)\n turn7: action S -> state at turn8: y=3 ( freeway3 at T=2: [-29,-18], [49,60], [13,24] -> safe)\n turn8: action S -> state at turn9: y=3 ( freeway3 at T=3: [-23,-12], [55,66], [19,30] -> safe)\n turn9: action U -> state at turn10: y=4 ( freeway4 at T=4: [-23+6*4=1, -12+6*4=12] -> [1,12] (0 not in) -> safe)\n turn10: action U -> state at turn11: y=5 ( freeway5 at T=5: [-23+30=7, -12+30=18] -> [7,18] -> safe)\n turn11: action U -> state at turn12: y=6 ( freeway6 at T=6: [-23+36=13, -12+36=24] -> [13,24] -> safe)\n turn12: action U -> state at turn13: y=7 ( freeway7 at T=7: [19,30] -> safe)\n turn13: action U -> state at turn14: y=8 ( freeway8 at T=8: car1=[-51+32=-19, -40+32=-8] -> safe; car2=[25+32=57,36+32=68] -> safe; car3=[-11+32=21, 32] -> safe)\n turn14: action U -> state at turn15: y=9 ( goal, safe)\n\n So it is safe.\n\n Therefore, the minimal number of turns H is 9 actions.\n\n So the answer is the sequence above.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 9, with the sequence of actions starting at turn \\(t_1 = 6\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) at turn 15 (\\(t_1 + 9 = 15\\)).\n\n- At turn 6, the player is at \\((0, 3)\\).

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,2) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible without colliding with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t₁ = 8, and I'm at y=2.\n\nFirst, I should understand how the cars move. All cars are moving right with various speeds. The collision happens only if at turn T, I'm on a freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there's a car such that 0 is in its span at that exact turn.\n\nThe player position updates after the action, so if I move up or down, I'm on the new row only at the next turn. Specifically, if at turn T I'm on y_T, and I take action A_t, then at turn T+1, I'm on y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy.\n\nBut for collision, it says: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\" And it also says that if I move to a different y at turn T, I'm not considered on that new y until turn T+1. Let me read carefully.\n\nIt says: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nSo, at turn T, I am on y_T, and I might collide with cars on that row at that turn. After I take the action, I move to a new position for the next turn.\n\nSo, for each turn, I am on a specific row, and I check for collision on that row at that turn.\n\nNow, the cars are given at turn t₁=8. So I need to compute their positions at future turns.\n\nLet me denote the time from t₁. Set τ = 0 at t₁, so at τ=0, turn is 8.\n\nAt τ=0, I am at y=2.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nThe actions: U increases y by 1, D decreases by 1, S stays.\n\ny must be between 0 and 9, inclusive.\n\nI start at y=2, want to go to y=9, so I need to increase y by 7. Since I can only move +1 per turn with U, or stay or down, but down would be counterproductive, so probably I need at least 7 turns if I move up every turn. But I might have to wait sometimes to avoid cars, so H might be more than 7.\n\nBut let's see the car positions.\n\nFirst, list all the cars and their spans at τ=0 (turn t₁=8).\n\nFreeway k=1 to 8.\n\nFor each, cars are given with (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nDirection: all are right, I think, since it says right-moving in the update.\n\nIn the table, for k=1 to 3, it's (-18,-29,right,6), (60,49,right,6), (24,13,right,6)\n\nFor k=4,5,6,7: (0,-11,right,6), (48,37,right,6)\n\nk=4 to 7 have two cars each.\n\nk=8: (-32,-43,right,4), (44,33,right,4), (8,-3,right,4)\n\nNow, for right-moving cars, the span at time T is [τ + s(T - t₁), h + s(T - t₁)]? Let's see the update.\n\nFrom the rule:\n\nFor right-moving: Span(T) = [τ + s(T - t₁), h + s(T - t₁)]\n\nIn the notation, it says for car k, head h, tail τ, but in the table, it's (head, tail, dir, speed), so let's use head and tail.\n\nIn the update:\n\nFor right-moving: Span(T) = [tail + s(T - t₁), head + s(T - t₁)]\n\nSimilarly, for left, but all are right here.\n\nIn this case, all cars are right-moving.\n\nSo, for a car with head h, tail t, speed s, at time T, position is [t + s(T - t₁), h + s(T - t₁)]\n\nSince it's moving right, tail is left, head is right? In the notation, for right-moving, it says \"Span(t₁) = [τ, h]\" so τ is tail, h is head, so tail ≤ head.\n\nIn the table, for example, k=1: (-18,-29,right,6), but -18 and -29, -18 > -29, so head = -18, tail = -29? But tail should be less than head for right-moving.\n\n-29 is less than -18, so tail = -29, head = -18? But in the tuple it's written as (head, tail), so ( -18, -29 ), but -18 > -29, so head is -18, tail is -29, but for right-moving, if head is to the right, but on a number line, right is increasing x, so head should be greater than tail.\n\nHere, head = -18, tail = -29, since -18 > -29, so yes, head is right of tail.\n\nSimilarly, (60,49), 60>49, head=60, tail=49.\n\n(24,13), 24>13.\n\nFor k=4: (0,-11), 0 > -11, head=0, tail=-11.\n\n(48,37), 48>37.\n\nk=8: (-32,-43), -32 > -43, head=-32, tail=-43.\n\n(44,33), 44>33.\n\n(8,-3), 8>-3, head=8, tail=-3.\n\nAll consistent.\n\nNow at time T, for a car, Span(T) = [tail + s(T - t₁), head + s(T - t₁)]\n\nSince t₁=8, let δ = T - 8, so δ is the number of turns after t₁.\n\nAt time T=8 + δ, Span(T) = [tail + s * δ, head + s * δ]\n\nCollision occurs if at turn T, I am on freeway y_T, and for some car on that freeway, 0 ∈ [tail + s δ, head + s δ]\n\nSince the freeway is fixed, and cars are on specific freeways.\n\ny_T is the row I'm on at turn T.\n\nI start at τ=0 (δ=0), y=2.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\nThe freeways y=1 to y=8 have cars; y=0 and y=9 are safe, I assume, since no cars mentioned, and collision only on freeways with cars.\n\nThe problem says \"avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1,…,8\", so y=0 and y=9 should be safe, no cars.\n\nAt y=0, I might be safe, and y=9 is the goal.\n\nNow, I need to move from y=2 to y=9, passing through y=3 to y=8, but I might stay on some rows or move up/down to avoid cars.\n\nSince I want to go up, probably moving up as much as possible, but avoiding collisions.\n\nNow, for each row, I need to know when it is safe to be there, i.e., when 0 is not in any car's span on that row.\n\nSince the cars move, the safety depends on time.\n\nAlso, since I can only move one row per turn, I need to plan the path.\n\nFirst, let's list for each freeway k, the cars and their span as a function of δ.\n\nδ = T - t₁ = T - 8.\n\nFor freeway k=1: cars:\n\nCar A: head=-18, tail=-29, s=6, so Span(δ) = [-29 + 6δ, -18 + 6δ]\n\nCar B: head=60, tail=49, s=6, Span(δ) = [49 + 6δ, 60 + 6δ]\n\nCar C: head=24, tail=13, s=6, Span(δ) = [13 + 6δ, 24 + 6δ]\n\nSimilarly for k=2 and k=3, same cars? The table shows identical for k=1,2,3.\n\n\" | 1 | (-18, -29, right, 6), (60, 49, right, 6), (24, 13, right, 6) | \"\n\n\" | 2 | (-18, -29, right, 6), (60, 49, right, 6), (24, 13, right, 6) | \"\n\n\" | 3 | (-18, -29, right, 6), (60, 49, right, 6), (24, 13, right, 6) | \"\n\nSo rows 1,2,3 have identical car setups.\n\nThen k=4: (0, -11, right, 6), (48, 37, right, 6)\n\nSo Car D: head=0, tail=-11, s=6, Span(δ) = [-11 + 6δ, 0 + 6δ]\n\nCar E: head=48, tail=37, s=6, Span(δ) = [37 + 6δ, 48 + 6δ]\n\nSimilarly for k=5,6,7: same as k=4.\n\nk=4,5,6,7 all have (0,-11,right,6) and (48,37,right,6)\n\nThen k=8: (-32,-43,right,4), (44,33,right,4), (8,-3,right,4)\n\nCar F: head=-32, tail=-43, s=4, Span(δ) = [-43 + 4δ, -32 + 4δ]\n\nCar G: head=44, tail=33, s=4, Span(δ) = [33 + 4δ, 44 + 4δ]\n\nCar H: head=8, tail=-3, s=4, Span(δ) = [-3 + 4δ, 8 + 4δ]\n\nNow, for a given row k and time δ, it is safe if 0 is not in any car's span on that row.\n\nThat is, for each car, 0 ∉ [tail + s δ, head + s δ]\n\nSince head >= tail, the interval is [L, U] with L = tail + s δ, U = head + s δ.\n\n0 not in [L,U] means either U < 0 or L > 0.\n\nI need this for all cars on that row.\n\nFor row k, at δ, safe if for all cars on k, 0 not in their span.\n\nNow, I start at row 2, δ=0.\n\nFirst, let's find for each row, when it is unsafe.\n\nSince I need to go up, and rows 1,2,3 are identical, similarly 4,5,6,7, and row 8 different.\n\nI am at row 2 at δ=0.\n\nFirst, check if row 2 is safe at δ=0.\n\nFor row 2, cars: same as row 1.\n\nCar A: Span(0) = [-29, -18], so L=-29, U=-18 <0, so U<0, 0 not in span.\n\nCar B: [49,60], L=49>0, so L>0, 0 not in span.\n\nCar C: [13,24], L=13>0, 0 not in span.\n\nSo at δ=0, all cars on row 2 have spans away from 0, so row 2 is safe at δ=0.\n\nSimilarly, row 1 and 3 should be same at δ=0.\n\nNow, I need to move to row 3,4,etc., up to 9.\n\nBut row 9 has no cars, so safe always.\n\nSimilarly row 0 safe.\n\nBut I'm going up.\n\nNow, since I can only change row by one per turn, and I start at y=2.\n\nThe minimal H would be if I go up every turn: from 2 to 3,4,5,6,7,8,9, that's 7 moves, so H=7, ending at turn t1+6? Let's see.\n\nAt turn T, I take action a_T, then at T+1, I am at new y.\n\nDefine the turns.\n\nSet t = t₁ + τ for τ = 0,1,2,...\n\nAt τ=0, turn t₁+0 =8, I am at y=2.\n\nI take action a_{t₁} at turn t₁, which determines y at τ=1.\n\nAfter action at turn T, y_{T+1} is set.\n\nAt turn T, I am at y_T, I take action a_T, then y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy.\n\nFor collision at turn T, it depends on y_T and the cars at that turn.\n\nIn this case, at τ=0 (T=8), y=2, which is safe, as above.\n\nThen I take action, say U, then at τ=1 (T=9), I am at y=3.\n\nThen at T=9, I am on row 3, check collision.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, to reach y=9, I need to be at y=9 at some turn.\n\ny_{t₁ + H -1} =9.\n\nAt turn t₁ + H -1, I am at y=9.\n\nThe actions are from t= t₁ to t₁ + H-1, so H actions, and after H actions, I am at y=9.\n\nSince I start at y=2, and I need to increase by 7, if all U, after 7 actions, I am at y=9.\n\nBut I might need to wait or go down if necessary, but going down seems bad, so probably not.\n\nFirst, let's find for each row, the times when it is unsafe.\n\nSince rows 1,2,3 are identical, let's group them.\n\nSimilarly rows 4,5,6,7 identical.\n\nRow 8 different.\n\nRow 9 safe.\n\nNow, for row 1,2,3: cars with s=6.\n\nCar A: Span(δ) = [-29 + 6δ, -18 + 6δ]\n\n0 in span if -29 +6δ <= 0 <= -18 +6δ\n\nWhich is -29 +6δ <=0 and 0 <= -18 +6δ\n\nSo 6δ <=29 and 6δ >=18, so δ <= 29/6 ≈4.833, δ >= 18/6=3\n\nSo for δ from 3 to 4 inclusive? δ integer?\n\nδ is integer, since turns are discrete.\n\nδ = T - t₁, integer.\n\nSo δ >=3 and δ <=4.833, so δ=3,4.\n\nAt δ=3: L = -29 +18 = -11, U= -18+18=0?

Earlier for row 1,2,3, unsafe only at δ=3,4, so at δ=0, safe.\n\nYes.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nSince y=9 safe, I just need to be there at some turn.\n\nBut minimal turns, so I want to go up as fast as possible.\n\nNow, I am at y=2 at δ=0.\n\nI can take actions: U, D, S.\n\nBut D to y=1 might not help, since I need to go up.\n\nS stays on y=2.\n\nBut I need to go to y=9.\n\nNow, the rows above: y=3,4,5,6,7,8.\n\ny=3 is same as y=2, group 1,2,3.\n\ny=4,5,6,7 are group with unsafe at δ=0,1.\n\ny=8 unsafe at δ=0 and δ>=8.\n\nNow, at δ=0, I am on y=2, safe.\n\nIf I go up to y=3 at next turn.\n\nTake action at τ=0 (turn 8): if I take U, then at τ=1 (turn 9), I am at y=3.\n\nNow at turn 9, δ=1 (since T=9, δ=9-8=1), y=3.\n\ny=3 is row 3, group 1,2,3, which at δ=1 is safe, since unsafe only δ=3,4.\n\nSo safe.\n\nThen I can go up again to y=4 at turn 10.\n\nAction at turn 9: U, then at turn 10, y=4.\n\nTurn 10, δ=2.\n\ny=4 is row 4, group 4,5,6,7.\n\nAt δ=2, row 4 safe, since unsafe only δ=0,1.\n\nδ=2>=2, safe.\n\nSimilarly, I can go to y=5 at turn 11, δ=3.\n\ny=5, group 4,5,6,7, at δ=3, safe? δ=3>1, so safe.\n\nSimilarly to y=6 at turn 12, δ=4, y=6, group 4-7, safe.\n\nTo y=7 at turn 13, δ=5, y=7, safe.\n\nTo y=8 at turn 14, δ=6, y=8.\n\nRow 8 at δ=6: δ=6 between 1 and 7, so safe.\n\nThen to y=9 at turn 15, δ=7.\n\nAction at turn 14: U, to y=9 at turn 15.\n\nAt turn 15, y=9, which is safe.\n\nNow, how many turns: from start.\n\nAt turn 8 (δ=0), I am at y=2.\n\nI take action at turn 8: U, to y=3 at turn 9.\n\nAction turn 9: U, to y=4 at turn 10.\n\nAction turn 10: U, to y=5 at turn 11.\n\nAction turn 11: U, to y=6 at turn 12.\n\nAction turn 12: U, to y=7 at turn 13.\n\nAction turn 13: U, to y=8 at turn 14.\n\nAction turn 14: U, to y=9 at turn 15.\n\nSo at turn 15, I reach y=9.\n\nThe actions are from turn 8 to turn 14, that's 7 actions: all U.\n\nH is the number of turns, from t= t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nt1=8.\n\nI reach y=9 at turn 15.\n\nturn 15 = t1 + 7, since 8+7=15.\n\ny_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nAt turn t1 + H -1, I am at y=9.\n\nIn this case, at turn 15, y=9.\n\nt1 + H -1 =15, t1=8, so 8 + H -1 =15, so 7 + H =15? 8 + H -1 =15, so H-1=7, H=8.\n\nLet's see: the sequence of actions.\n\nI take actions at turns: t1, t1+1, ..., up to t1 + H -1.\n\nAfter H actions, I am at turn t1 + H.\n\nDefine:\n\nAt time turn T, I am at y_T.\n\nAt turn T, I take action a_T, then y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy.\n\nAfter action at T, I move to new position at T+1.\n\nThe position y_{T+1} is after the action.\n\nAt turn T, I am at y_T, and collision check based on y_T and cars at T.\n\nI start at turn t1=8, y=2.\n\nI take actions at t=8,9,10,..., up to t= t1 + H -1.\n\nAfter H actions, I have moved H times, so I am at turn t1 + H.\n\nBut I need to be at y=9 at some turn, specifically at turn t1 + H -1? The problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H -1\"\n\n\" y_{t1 + H -1} =9 \"\n\ny_{t1 + H -1} =9, meaning at that turn, position is 9.\n\nIn terms of turns:\n\nAt turn t1 + H -1, I am at y=9.\n\nThe actions are taken from t=t1 to t=t1 + H -1, so H actions.\n\nFor example, if H=1, I take action at t1, and at turn t1, I am at y_t1, but after action, at turn t1+1, I am at new y, but y_{t1 + H -1} for H=1 is y_t1, so I need to be at y=9 already at start? But I am at y=2, so H>1.\n\nIn this case, to reach y=9 from y=2, minimal with all up: start at y=2 at turn 8.\n\nAfter first U at turn 8, at turn 9 y=3.\n\nAfter U at 9, at 10 y=4.\n\n...\nAfter U at 14, at 15 y=9.\n\nSo at turn 15, y=9.\n\nNow, turn 15 = t1 + 7, since 8+7=15.\n\ny_{t1 + H -1} =9, so t1 + H -1 =15, 8 + H -1 =15, 7 + H =15? 8 + H -1 =15, so H-1=7, H=8.\n\nThe actions: from turn t1 to t1+H-1, which is turn 8 to 15? t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nt1 + H -1 =15, so actions at turn 8 to 15? But that would be 8 actions.\n\nt1 to t1+H-1 inclusive: number of actions is (t1+H-1) - t1 +1 = H.\n\nAt turn t1, I take action a_{t1}, which affects y at t1+1.\n\nBut the position at turn t1 is given before action.\n\nAt turn t1, I am at y_{t1}, then I take action a_{t1}, then y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + Δy.\n\nSimilarly for next.\n\nThe collision at turn t1 depends on y_{t1} and cars at t1.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn t1 + H -1, I am at y=9.\n\nThe actions are a_{t1}, a_{t1+1}, ..., a_{t1+H-1}.\n\nIn my plan, to be at y=9 at turn 15, which is t1+7.\n\nt1+7 = t1 + H -1, so H-1=7, H=8.\n\nActions at turn 8 to 15? turn 15 is t1+7.\n\nt1 + H -1 = t1 +7, so H-1=7, H=8.\n\nActions at t=8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15? But at turn 15, if I take action, it would go to turn 16.\n\nBut I need to be at y=9 at turn t1+H-1=15.\n\nSo at turn 15, I am already at y=9, and I don't need to take action after that for moving to next, but the action sequence includes a_{t1+H-1}, which is at turn 15.\n\nBut at turn 15, if I am at y=9, and I take action, but since I have reached, I can take S or whatever, but the position is already 9.\n\nIn terms of collision, at turn 15, if I am at y=9, safe.\n\nBut I need to take action at turn 15, but it might affect, but since I am at y=9, I can take S, for example.\n\nIn the sequence, for H=8, actions from t=8 to t=15.\n\nAt t=8: take action, to y=9 at t=9? No.\n\nStart: at t=8, y=2.\n\nTake a_8, then at t=9, y= y2 + Δy.\n\nIn my earlier: take U at t=8, to y=3 at t=9.\n\nU at t=9, to y=4 at t=10.\n\n...\n\nU at t=14, to y=9 at t=15.\n\nAt t=15, y=9.\n\nNow, I need to be at y=9 at turn t1+H-1=15, so yes.\n\nBut I also need to take action at t=15? a_{t1+H-1} = a_{15}.\n\nAt turn 15, I am at y=9, I take action, but since I am at y=9, and I need to stay or whatever, but the position after action: if I take U, y=10, but y=10 invalid, since y=0 to9, so cannot, must take S or D, but D to y=8 not good.\n\nBut I don't need to move, I just need to be at y=9 at that turn.\n\nSo at turn 15, I am at y=9, I can take action S, then y_{16} still 9, but I don't care.\n\nThe condition is y_{t1+H-1}=9, so at turn 15, it is 9.\n\nThen action at t=15 can be S.\n\nIn the sequence, for H=8, actions at t=8 to15: a8 to a15.\n\na8: U, to y=3 at t=9\n\na9: U, to y=4 at t=10\n\na10: U, to y=5 at t=11\n\na11: U, to y=6 at t=12\n\na12: U, to y=7 at t=13\n\na13: U, to y=8 at t=14\n\na14: U, to y=9 at t=15\n\nThen at t=15, y=9, and I take a15, which can be S, then y16=9, but not needed.\n\nBut y_{t1+H-1} = y15=9, good.\n\nNow, is there a collision in this path?\n\nLet's check each turn.\n\nAt turn 8 (δ=0), y=2, row 2, group 1-3, safe at δ=0.\n\nAction U.\n\nAt turn 9 (δ=1), y=3, row 3, group 1-3, at δ=1, safe (unsafe only δ=3,4).\n\nAction U.\n\nAt turn 10 (δ=2), y=4, row 4, group 4-7, at δ=2, safe (unsafe δ=0,1).\n\nAction U.\n\nAt turn 11 (δ=3), y=5, row 5, group 4-7, at δ=3, safe.\n\nAction U.\n\nAt turn 12 (δ=4), y=6, row 6, group 4-7, at δ=4, safe.\n\nAction U.\n\nAt turn 13 (δ=5), y=7, row 7, group 4-7, at δ=5, safe.\n\nAction U.\n\nAt turn 14 (δ=6), y=8, row 8, at δ=6, row 8 safe for δ=1 to7, yes.\n\nAction U.\n\nAt turn 15 (δ=7), y=9, safe.\n\nAction S or whatever, but since we reach at turn 15, and we take action at turn 15, but for the sequence, we need to specify.\n\nIn the action list, we have a_{t1} to a_{t1+H-1}, all must be specified.\n\nAt turn 15, since y=9, we can take S.\n\nNow, but in this path, I used 7 U actions to go from 2 to 9, but with H=8 actions? Actions from t8 to t15, that's 8 actions: a8 to a15.\n\na8: U to y=3 at t9\n\na9: U to y=4 at t10\n\n...\n\na14: U to y=9 at t15\n\na15: at t15, take action, but y15=9, so if I take S, y16=9, or U to 10 invalid, so must take S or D, but S is fine.\n\nBut the position at turn t1+H-1=t15 is y=9, which is good.\n\nBut I have an extra action at t15 which is not necessary for reaching, but since H includes it, and the sequence must have H actions ending when we reach.\n\nTo minimize H, perhaps I can reach earlier.\n\nWith all up, I go from y=2 to y=9 in 7 moves, arriving at turn 15.\n\nBut turn 15 is t1+7, and y_{t1+7}=9.\n\ny_{t1+H-1}=9, so t1+H-1 = t1+7, thus H-1=7, H=8.\n\nBut at turn t1+7, I am at y=9, and I need to take the H-th action at that turn, but since I am already there, it might be wasteful, but necessary for the sequence.\n\nPerhaps I can be at y=9 at an earlier turn.\n\nFor example, if I start moving earlier, but I start at y=2 at t=8.\n\nMinimal time: since I need to increase y by 7, I need at least 7 up moves, but I might be able to do it with less than 8 actions? No, with 7 up moves, I go to y=9 at turn 15, but I take 7 actions from t8 to t14 to arrive at t15.\n\nLet's count the actions and turns.\n\nAt turn 8: position y=2\n\nAfter action a8: position at turn 9 is y2 + Δy\n\nAfter a9: position at turn 10\n\n...\n\nAfter a_k: position at turn 9 + k? Let's index.\n\nSet turn index.\n\nAt turn T, position y_T.\n\nAfter action a_T, y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy.\n\nStart: T=8, y8=2\n\nTake a8, then y9 = y8 + Δy8\n\nTake a9, y10 = y9 + Δy9\n\n...\n\nTake a_{T}, y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy_T\n\nI need y_{some T} =9.\n\nSpecifically, y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nt1=8, so y_{8 + H -1} =9.\n\nNow, from y8=2 to y_{8+H-1}=9.\n\nThe number of actions from turn 8 to turn (8+H-2) to reach position at turn (8+H-1).\n\nThe position changes after each action.\n\nAfter first action (at T=8), position at T=9.\n\nAfter second action (at T=9), position at T=10.\n\n...\n\nAfter k-th action, position at T=8+k.\n\nI need position at T=8+H-1 to be 9.\n\nAfter (H-1) actions, position at T=8 + (H-1).\n\nSet: after m actions, position at turn 8 + m.\n\nI need this position to be 9 for some m.\n\ny_{8 + m} =9.\n\nSince y8=2, to reach y=9, the minimal m is 7, since I need to increase by 7, so y_{8+7} = y15=9.\n\nThen, at that point, m=7, so after 7 actions, at turn 15.\n\nNow, the actions are taken at turns 8,9,10,11,12,13,14: that's 7 actions.\n\nThen at turn 15, position y=9, and I don't take action at turn 15 for this, but the sequence should include a_{t1} to a_{t1+H-1}, with y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nIn this case, with actions at t=8 to t=14, H=7 actions? t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nt1=8, t1+H-1=14, so H-1=6? Let's solve: t1 + H -1 =14, 8 + H -1 =14, 7 + H =14? 8+H-1=14, H-1=6, H=7.\n\nThen y_{t1+H-1} = y_{14} =? In the plan, after action at t=13: to y=8 at t=14? Let's see:\n\nActions:\n\na8 at t=8: U, y9=3\n\na9 at t=9: U, y10=4\n\na10 at t=10: U, y11=5\n\na11 at t=11: U, y12=6\n\na12 at t=12: U, y13=7\n\na13 at t=13: U, y14=8\n\na14 at t=14: ? But if H=7, actions from t=8 to t=14, a8 to a14.\n\nAfter a14, y15 = y14 + Δy14.\n\nBut y14=8 (from above), if I take a14=U, then y15=9.\n\nBut y_{t1+H-1} = y_{14} for H=7? t1+H-1=8+7-1=14, y14=8, not 9.\n\nProblem.\n\nTo have y_{t1+H-1}=9, with H=7, y_{8+7-1}=y14=9.\n\nBut from above, at t14, y14=8 if I arrived at t14 with previous actions.\n\nTo have y14=9, I need to be at y=9 at turn 14.\n\nBut at turn 14, y=9.\n\nHow? Start y8=2.\n\nIf I take actions to increase faster, but I can only increase by 1 per U.\n\nSo from y8=2 to y14=9, that's 6 turns later, but y increases by at most 6 in 6 actions? From turn 8 to turn 14.\n\nAt turn 8: y=2\n\nAfter a8, y9 =2 + Δy\n\n...\n\nAfter a13, y14 = y13 + Δy13\n\nThe position at turn T is before action at T.\n\ny_T is position at turn T.\n\ny8=2\n\nAfter action a8, y9 = y8 + Δy8\n\nSimilarly, y10 = y9 + Δy9\n\n...\n\ny14 = y13 + Δy13\n\nTo have y14=9, since y8=2, the sum of Δy from t=8 to t=13 must be +7.\n\nΔy_t for t=8 to13, 6 actions, each +1,0,-1, so maximum increase 6, cannot reach +7 in 6 steps.\n\ny14 = y8 + sum_{k=8 to13} Δy_k\n\nSince y14 and y8, difference over 6 steps.\n\nFrom turn 8 to turn 14, there are 6 actions: a8 to a13, affecting y9 to y14.\n\ny9 = y8 + Δy8\n\ny10 = y9 + Δy9 = y8 + Δy8 + Δy9\n\n...\n\ny14 = y8 + Δy8 + Δy9 + Δy10 + Δy11 + Δy12 + Δy13\n\nSo y14 = 2 + sum_{k=8 to13} Δy_k\n\nEach Δy_k <=1, so y14 <= 2 + 6*1 = 8\n\nSimilarly, y14 >= 2 + 6*(-1) = -4, but y>=0.\n\nSo y14 <=8, cannot be 9.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to be at y=9 at turn 14.\n\nSimilarly, earliest possible is turn 15, with y15=9.\n\nThen for y15=9, we have y15 = y8 + sum_{k=8 to14} Δy_k = 2 + sum_{k=8 to14} Δy_k\n\nSet equal to 9, so sum_{k=8 to14} Δy_k =7\n\nSince each Δy <=1, and 7 terms, must all be U, Δy=+1.\n\nSo only possible with all U actions from t=8 to t=14, then y15=9.\n\nThen at turn 15, y=9.\n\nNow, for the sequence, actions from t=t1 to t=t1+H-1, with y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nt1+H-1=15, so 8+H-1=15, H-1=7, H=8.\n\nThen actions at t=8 to t=15.\n\na8 to a15.\n\na8: U, to y9=3\n\na9: U, to y10=4\n\na10: U, to y11=5\n\na11: U, to y12=6\n\na12: U, to y13=7\n\na13: U, to y14=8\n\na14: U, to y15=9\n\nThen at t=15, y15=9, and I take a15, which must be S (since U to 10 invalid, D to 8 not desired, but I can take S to stay).\n\nThen y16=9, but not relevant.\n\nNow, collision: we need to ensure no collision at each turn from t=8 to t=15, but at t=15, y=9, no cars, safe.\n\nIn the path:\n\nAt t=8 (δ=0), y=2, safe as before.\n\nt=9 (δ=1), y=3, safe.\n\nt=10 (δ=2), y=4, row 4, group 4-7, at δ=2, safe.\n\nt=11 (δ=3), y=5, row 5, group 4-7, at δ=3, safe (δ>=2 safe).\n\nt=12 (δ=4), y=6, same, safe.\n\nt=13 (δ=5), y=7, same, safe.\n\nt=14 (δ=6), y=8, row 8, at δ=6, safe (δ=1 to7 safe).\n\nt=15 (δ=7), y=9, safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nBut in this, I have to take a15 at t=15, which is S.\n\nBut is there a way to reach with H smaller? H=8 with 7 U and 1 S at end.\n\nBut minimal H should be 8, since to reach y=9 from y=2, need at least 7 up moves, and with 7 actions I can be at y=9 at turn 15, but with actions from t=8 to t=14 (7 actions), I arrive at t=15, but y_{t1+H-1} for H=7 is y_{14}, which is not 9.\n\nTo have y_{t1+H-1}=9 with smaller H, but as above, impossible before turn 15.\n\nFor example, H=7: t1+H-1=8+7-1=14, y14=9 impossible.\n\nH=8: t1+H-1=15, y15=9 possible.\n\nSo minimal H is 8.\n\nIn the sequence, I have actions from t=8 to t=15, all U except last S? a8 to a14 are U, a15 is S.\n\nBut in the movement, a8 to a14 are all U, moving up each time.\n\nIn terms of turns, I am on rows at each turn:\n\nt=8: y=2\n\nt=9: y=3\n\nt=10: y=4\n\nt=11: y=5\n\nt=12: y=6\n\nt=13: y=7\n\nt=14: y=8\n\nt=15: y=9\n\nAll safe as per earlier.\n\nBut is there a problem with row 8 at some point? At t=14, δ=6, row 8 safe.\n\nBut earlier I thought about row 4-7 being unsafe at δ=0,1, but in this path, I am on row 4 at t=10, δ=2, safe.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nBut in the beginning, at δ=0, I am on row 2, not on row 4, so no issue.\n\nBut let me confirm row 8 at δ=6.\n\nδ=6, row 8: car F Span(6)= [-43 + 4*6, -32 + 4*6] = [-43+24, -32+24] = [-19,-8] <0, not 0.\n\nCar G: [33+24,44+24]=[57,68]>0\n\nCar H: [-3+24,8+24]=[21,32]>0, so all safe.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut in the car states, for row 4 at δ=2, car D: Span(2)= [-11+12, 0+12] = [1,12], L=1>0, not 0.\n\nGood.\n\nBut is there a faster way? For example, if I could be on a row earlier, but no, I need to go through each row.\n\nSince row 4-7 are unsafe at δ=0,1, but I am not on them at those times.\n\nAnother thing: at δ=3 and 4, rows 1-3 are unsafe, but in this path, at δ=3, t=11, I am on y=5, row 5, which is group 4-7, safe at δ=3.\n\nAt δ=4, t=12, y=6, same.\n\nI am not on rows 1-3 at δ=3,4.\n\nSimilarly, row 8 unsafe at δ=0,8,9,10, but at δ=0, I am on row 2, not 8; at δ=8, t=16, which is beyond, but I reach at t=15, δ=7, before that.\n\nSo all good.\n\nBut H=8, with 7 U and one S.\n\nBut the S at the end is necessary for the action sequence, but it doesn't move.\n\nPerhaps I can avoid the extra action by reaching earlier, but I cannot.\n\nAnother idea: maybe I can stay on some row to wait, but that would increase H, not decrease.\n\nFor example, if I stay at y=2 for some turns, then go up, but I would arrive later, so H larger.\n\nSimilarly, if I go down, worse.\n\nSo this should be minimal H=8.\n\nBut in the sequence, for the answer, I need to output the actions.\n\nBut let me see if I can reach with H=7 by being at y=9 at turn 14, but impossible as above.\n\nPerhaps I start moving down or something, but no.\n\nAnother thought: at the beginning, I am at y=2, δ=0.\n\nIf I take S at t=8, stay at y=2, then at t=9, y=2 still, but then I take U to y=3 at t=10, etc., but I arrive later.\n\nFor example, at t=8: S, y9=2\n\nt=9: U, y10=3\n\nt=10: U, y11=4\n\n... then to y=9 at t=16 or later, worse.\n\nSo not good.\n\nThus, the all-up path is fastest.\n\nBut in this path, with H=8, actions: a8=U, a9=U, a10=U, a11=U, a12=U, a13=U, a14=U, a15=S\n\nBut a15=S at turn 15 when I am already at y=9.\n\nNow, for the collision at turn t=15: y=9, no cars, safe.\n\nBut in the sequence, it should be fine.\n\nPerhaps I don't need the last action if I am already at goal, but the problem requires the sequence until I reach, including the action at the turn I reach.\n\ny_{t1+H-1}=9, so at that turn, I am at 9, and I take an action, but since it is the last, I can take S.\n\nTo minimize H, it should be ok.\n\nBut let me check if I can have y_{t1+H-1}=9 with H=7.\n\nAs before, impossible.\n\nPerhaps I can be at y=9 at turn 14 by other means, but no.\n\nAnother point: when I move, if I am at y=8 at some turn, and I take U, I go to y=9 at next turn.\n\nBut at turn when I am at y=8, I need to take U to go to 9.\n\nIn the sequence, to have y_T=9 at T=15, with actions from t=8 to t=14.\n\nBut with H=7, actions to t=13? Let's not confuse.\n\nI think H=8 is minimal.\n\nBut in the car states, for row 8, at δ=6, safe, but let me confirm the time.\n\nt=14, δ= t-8=6, yes.\n\nBut in row 8, at δ=6, car H: Span(6)= [-3+24,8+24]=[21,32], no issue.\n\nBut earlier for car H at δ=0, it was unsafe, but at δ=0, t=8, I was on row 2.\n\nNow, back to the task, I need to output the sequence.\n\nBut in the sequence, I have a15=S, but is there a way to avoid that?\n\nSuppose I reach y=9 at turn 14, but impossible.\n\nPerhaps I start from y=2 at t=8, and after 6 actions, I am at y=8 at t=14, then at t=14 I take U, to y=9 at t=15, but at t=14 I am at y=8, not 9.\n\nTo be at y=9 at t=14, I need y14=9.\n\nBut y14 = y8 + sum_{k=8 to13} Δy_k =2 + sum of 6 terms <=2+6=8, cannot be 9.\n\nSo indeed impossible.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 8.\n\nNow, for the sequence, actions from t=8 to t=15.\n\nt=8: action U\n\nt=9: U\n\nt=10: U\n\nt=11: U\n\nt=12: U\n\nt=13: U\n\nt=14: U\n\nt=15: S\n\nBut at t=15, action S.\n\nIn the output, it should be for each turn.\n\nBut let me write the turns.\n\nCurrent turn is t1=8.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 8: a_{8} = U\n\nTurn 9: a_{9} = U\n\nTurn 10: a_{10} = U\n\nTurn 11: a_{11} = U\n\nTurn 12: a_{12} = U\n\nTurn 13: a_{13} = U\n\nTurn 14: a_{14} = U\n\nTurn 15: a_{15} = S\n\nH=8.\n\nBut is there a problem with row 4 at some point? No.\n\nBut in row 4-7, at δ=0 and 1 unsafe, but I am on row 4 at t=10, δ=2, safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut let me check row 3 at t=9, δ=1.\n\nRow 3, group 1-3, at δ=1, unsafe? Earlier I said for row 1-3, unsafe only at δ=3,4.\n\nAt δ=1, safe.\n\nCar A: at δ=1, Span=[-29+6, -18+6]=[-23,-12] <0, not 0.\n\nCar B and C far away.\n\nSo safe.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nPerhaps I can have a shorter path by using down, but unlikely.\n\nFor example, if I go down to y=1, but at δ=0, y=1 is row 1, safe, but then I need to go up more, so more turns.\n\nNot better.\n\nSo I think this is fine.\n\nBut in the sequence, at turn 15, I put S, but since I am at y=9, and I need to stop, S is fine.\n\nPerhaps the action at the last turn is not needed, but the problem requires the sequence to reach, so I think it should include until the turn I am at 9.\n\nNow, for the answer format.\n\nBut let me see the car state again.\n\nIn row 4-7, at δ=0, car D has head=0, so 0 in span, unsafe.\n\nBut I am not on it.\n\nAnother thing: at turn t=10, δ=2, y=4, row 4.\n\nCar D: Span(2)= [-11+12, 0+12]= [1,12], 0 not in, good.\n\nBut is there any car that might be at 0 at other times?\n\nFor example, on row 8, car H at δ=0: Span(0)= [-3,8], includes 0, unsafe, but not on it.\n\nBut in my path, no issue.\n\nPerhaps I can start later, but no.\n\nI think it is correct.\n\nBut the problem is to output the sequence.\n\nBut in the initial position, I am at (0,2), and I need to reach (0,9), so y-coordinate.\n\nNow, the actions.\n\nBut in the sequence, H=8.\n\nBut let me confirm the minimal turns.\n\nSuppose I take no action at turn 15, but I have to for the sequence.\n\nPerhaps with H=7, but I cannot.\n\nAnother idea: if I am at y=8 at turn 14, and I take action at turn 14 to go to y=9 at turn 15, but at turn 14 I am at y=8, not 9.\n\nTo be at y=9 at turn 14, impossible.\n\nSo I think H=8 is minimal.\n\nNow for the output.\n\nAnswer format:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1}\n...\n}\n\nt1=8.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: S\n\nBut Turn 15 is t1 + 7, and since H=8, up to t1 + H -1 = 8+7=15.\n\nt1 + H -1 =15.\n\nYes.\n\nIn the sequence, the last action is S at turn 15.\n\nBut since the position is reached at turn 15, and I take S, it is fine.\n\nTo avoid S, I could have arrived earlier, but cannot.\n\nPerhaps I can be at y=9 at turn 15 without the last S, but the action sequence must be specified.\n\nI think it's acceptable.\n\nBut let me see if I can have a different path with same H or less, but less not possible.\n\nFor example, if I go to y=3 at turn 9, but then stay or something, but would take more turns.\n\nNo.\n\nSo I think this is the minimal.\n\nBut in the car state, for row 1,2,3 at δ=3,4 unsafe, but in my path, at δ=3, t=11, I am on y=5, not on row 1-3.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut just to be thorough, suppose at some point I need to avoid, but here no need.\n\nAnother thing: row 8 at δ=6, t=14, y=8.\n\nδ=6, row 8 safe.\n\nBut car F: at δ=6, Span=[-43+24, -32+24]=[-19,-8], no.\n\nCar H: at δ=6, [ -3+24, 8+24]=[21,32], no.\n\nGood.\n\nSo I think the sequence is fine.\n\nNow for the output.\n\nt1=8.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: S\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let me write it properly.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 2) at turn \\(t_1 = 8\\) and aims to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\nThe minimal \\(H\\) is 8, achieved by moving up (U) for the first 7 actions to increase the y-coordinate from 2 to 9, and then staying (S) at y=9 on the last turn.

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,3) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The cars are moving right, so their positions shift to the right over time.\n\nFirst, since all cars are moving right, their spans increase in the positive x-direction over time. But since we're only concerned with when they cross x=0 for collision, I need to find when any car on the freeway I'm on has its span including 0 at the turn I'm on that row.\n\nThe collision condition is: at turn T, if I'm on freeway y_T, then if for any car on that freeway, 0 is in its span at that exact turn, I collide.\n\nAlso, when I move from one row to another, I'm only on the new row at the next turn, so I don't get hit by cars on the row I'm moving to during the move turn.\n\nThe player position updates at each turn based on action: U for up (y+1), D for down (y-1), S for stay (y same).\n\nI start at y=3 at turn t=10.\n\nI need to reach y=9, which is the top row, I think. y=0 to 9, so y=9 is the goal.\n\ny=9 is the freeway? No, the freeways are y=1 to y=8, and y=0 and y=9 might be safe or something. The player position is at (0,y), so (0,0) and (0,9) are positions, not freeways. The freeways with cars are y=1 to y=8.\n\ny=0 and y=9 don't have cars, I assume, since they're not listed. So probably, when I'm at y=0 or y=9, no collision possible, but I need to be at (0,9) to finish.\n\nThe goal is to reach (0,9), so once I'm at (0,9), I'm done, no collision issue.\n\nNow, the car states are given for each freeway at turn t=10.\n\nAll cars are moving right, with given speeds.\n\nI need to simulate the car positions over time to see when it's safe to be on each row.\n\nSince the cars move continuously in position with time, but we're dealing with discrete turns, I think we need to compute the span at integer turns after t=10.\n\nLet t be the turn number relative to t_1=10. So at τ=0, it's turn 10, τ=1 is turn 11, and so on.\n\nSet τ = t - t_1, so at τ=0, it's turn t_1=10.\n\nPlayer starts at y=3.\n\nFor each freeway k, and for each car on it, we have the span at τ=0.\n\nThen at time τ (meaning turn t_1 + τ), the position of a car is shifted by s * τ, since speed s is in units per turn, I assume.\n\nThe update: for left-moving, but all are right-moving here, since direction is right.\n\nFor right-moving cars: at turn T, span is [τ + s(T - t_1), h + s(T - t_1)]? Let's see the notation.\n\nGiven: at turn t_1, for a right-moving car, span is [τ, h], so tail τ, head h? No.\n\nLook: \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h]\" for right-moving, but in the table, it says (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s).\n\nIn the car state, it's listed as (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s).\n\nFor example, freeway 1: cars (-6, -17, right, 6), so head is -6, tail is -17? That can't be right for right-moving.\n\nIf it's right-moving, head should be greater than tail if it's moving right.\n\n-6 > -17? -6 is greater than -17, yes, since -6 is to the right of -17 if x-axis increases right.\n\nx-axis: negative left, positive right, I assume.\n\nSo for a car, head and tail: for right-moving, head is the front, so head > tail, and it moves right.\n\nIn freeway 1, car: head h = -6, tail τ = -17, so since -6 > -17, head is at x=-6, tail at x=-17, so the span is from x=-17 to x=-6, which is length 11, and it moves right at speed 6.\n\nSimilarly, another car: head -42, tail -53? -42 > -53, so from -53 to -42.\n\nAnd (36, 25, right, 6), head 36, tail 25, so 25 to 36.\n\nBut head and tail: in the span, it's given as (head, tail), so for right-moving, [tail, head] is the interval, I think.\n\nIn the update rule: \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h] for right-moving\" and it says [τ, h], so τ is tail, h is head.\n\nThen at turn T, Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but all are right here.\n\nSo for a car at turn T, it spans [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nCollision on freeway k at turn T if player is on y=k and 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway.\n\nNow, for freeway k, we have multiple cars, so we need to check for each car if 0 in [τ_i + s_i (T-t_1), h_i + s_i (T-t_1)] for some car i on k.\n\nSince all cars on a freeway may have different positions and speeds, we need to consider all.\n\nIn this case, for some freeways, multiple cars are listed with the same parameters? Let's list the cars per freeway.\n\nFrom the table:\n\nFreeway 1: three cars: (-6,-17,right,6), (-42,-53,right,6), (36,25,right,6)\n\nAll with speed 6.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same as freeway 1? \"(-6, -17, right, 6), (-42, -53, right, 6), (36, 25, right, 6)\" for freeway 2? The table says:\n\n| Freeway k | Cars |\n\n1: (-6,-17,right,6), (-42,-53,right,6), (36,25,right,6)\n\n2: same: (-6,-17,right,6), (-42,-53,right,6), (36,25,right,6)\n\n3: same as 1 and 2.\n\n4: (12,1,right,6), (60,49,right,6)\n\n5: same as 4? (12,1,right,6), (60,49,right,6)\n\n6: same as 4 and 5.\n\n7: same as 4,5,6? (12,1,right,6), (60,49,right,6)\n\n8: different: (-24,-35,right,4), (52,41,right,4), (16,5,right,4) — speed 4.\n\nFreeway 8 has three cars with speed 4.\n\nFor freeways 1,2,3: identical cars? Positions are the same? That seems odd, but possible, I guess. Or is it a typo? But I'll assume it's as given.\n\nSimilarly, 4,5,6,7 have the same two cars.\n\n8 has different.\n\nBut for collision, we care about when 0 is covered on each freeway.\n\nSince the cars move, the times when 0 is covered depend on the car positions and speeds.\n\nLet me define τ = T - t_1, so at τ=0, turn t_1.\n\nFor a given freeway, the set of τ where it is dangerous to be on that freeway, i.e., some car has 0 in its span at that τ.\n\nFor a car with tail τ_t, head h, speed s, right-moving.\n\nAt time τ (relative), the span is [τ_t + s τ, h + s τ]\n\n0 in [τ_t + s τ, h + s τ] iff τ_t + s τ ≤ 0 ≤ h + s τ\n\nSince for right-moving, τ_t ≤ h, so the interval is from min to max.\n\nτ_t + s τ ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ h + s τ? No.\n\n0 in [A, B] means A ≤ 0 ≤ B.\n\nHere A = τ_t + s τ, B = h + s τ.\n\nSo A ≤ 0 ≤ B iff τ_t + s τ ≤ 0 and h + s τ ≥ 0.\n\nSince B = h + s τ, A = τ_t + s τ.\n\nSo inequality: τ_t + s τ ≤ 0 and h + s τ ≥ 0.\n\nWhich is equivalent to:\n\n- τ_t + s τ ≤ 0 ⇒ s τ ≤ -τ_t ⇒ τ ≤ -τ_t / s  (since s >0)\n\n- and h + s τ ≥ 0 ⇒ s τ ≥ -h ⇒ τ ≥ -h / s\n\nSo τ must satisfy: ceil( -h / s ) ≤ τ ≤ floor( -τ_t / s )? Let's see.\n\nFrom above:\n\nτ ≥ -h / s\n\nand τ ≤ -τ_t / s\n\nSince τ must be integer, because turns are discrete.\n\nτ is integer, time in turns.\n\nSo for the car to cover 0 at time τ, we need:\n\n- h / s + τ ≥ 0? From τ ≥ -h / s\n\nand τ ≤ -τ_t / s\n\nNow, since τ integer, the range of τ where it happens is from τ_min to τ_max where:\n\nτ_min = ceil( -h / s )\n\nτ_max = floor( -τ_t / s )\n\nThen for τ from τ_min to τ_max inclusive, 0 is in the span.\n\nBut we need to be careful with inequalities.\n\nFor example, if -h/s is integer, τ_min = -h/s, and at that τ, h + s τ = h + s*(-h/s) = h - h =0, so 0 is included.\n\nSimilarly, if -τ_t/s integer, τ_max = -τ_t/s, τ_t + s τ = τ_t + s*(-τ_t/s) = τ_t - τ_t =0, included.\n\nIf not integer, ceil and floor handle it.\n\nNow, for each car, we can find the interval of τ where it causes 0 to be covered.\n\nThen for a freeway, it is dangerous at τ if any car on that freeway has 0 covered at that τ.\n\nSo for each freeway, we can find the set of τ where it is not safe to be on that row.\n\nOtherwise, it is safe.\n\nNow, let's do this for each freeway.\n\nFirst, freeways 1,2,3: same cars, so same danger times.\n\nCars: car A: h=-6, τ_t=-17, s=6\n\ncar B: h=-42, τ_t=-53, s=6\n\ncar C: h=36, τ_t=25, s=6\n\nNow for car A: τ_min = ceil( -h / s ) = ceil( -(-6) / 6 ) = ceil(6/6) = ceil(1) =1\n\nτ_max = floor( -τ_t / s ) = floor( -(-17)/6 ) = floor(17/6) = floor(2.833) =2\n\n-τ_t = -(-17) =17, s=6, floor(17/6)= floor(2.833)=2\n\nτ_min = ceil( -h / s ) = ceil( -(-6)/6 ) = ceil(6/6)=ceil(1)=1\n\nSo for car A, 0 covered at τ=1 and τ=2.\n\nAt τ=1: A = τ_t + s τ = -17 +6*1 = -17+6=-11, B = h + s τ = -6 +6=0, so [ -11, 0], 0 included.\n\nAt τ=2: A = -17+12= -5, B= -6+12=6, [ -5,6], 0 included.\n\nAt τ=0: A= -17 +0 = -17, B= -6+0= -6, both negative, 0 not in [-17,-6].\n\nAt τ=3: A= -17+18=1, B= -6+18=12, both positive, 0 not in.\n\nSo τ=1,2.\n\nNow car B: h=-42, τ_t=-53, s=6\n\nτ_min = ceil( -h / s ) = ceil( -(-42)/6 ) = ceil(42/6)=ceil(7)=7\n\nτ_max = floor( -τ_t / s ) = floor( -(-53)/6 ) = floor(53/6) = floor(8.833)=8\n\nSo τ from 7 to 8 inclusive.\n\nAt τ=7: A = τ_t + s τ = -53 +42 = -11, B= -42 +42=0, [ -11,0], 0 in.\n\nτ=8: A= -53 +48= -5, B= -42+48=6, [ -5,6], 0 in.\n\nCar C: h=36, τ_t=25, s=6\n\nτ_min = ceil( -h / s ) = ceil( -36 / 6 ) = ceil(-6) = -6? -6 is integer, so τ_min = -6\n\nτ_max = floor( -τ_t / s ) = floor( -25 / 6 ) = floor( -4.166) = -5? Let's compute.\n\n-τ_t / s = -25 / 6 = -4.166, floor is -5? Floor of -4.166 is -5, since floor is the greatest integer less than or equal.\n\n-4.166, less than -4, so floor is -5.\n\nSimilarly, ceil(-6) = -6.\n\nNow τ must be integer, and τ >=0 since we start from τ=0, but τ can be negative? In this context, τ is time from t_1, so τ >=0, we don't care about past.\n\nSo for car C, τ_min = ceil(-36/6) = ceil(-6) = -6\n\nτ_max = floor(-25/6) = floor(-4.166) = -5\n\nBut τ >=0, so τ_min = -6 <0, τ_max = -5 <0, so for τ>=0, no overlap, car C does not cover 0 at any τ>=0.\n\nBecause at τ=0, span [25,36], both >0, moving right, so never covers 0 in future.\n\nSimilarly, other cars.\n\nSo for freeway 1 (and 2,3), dangerous at τ from car A: τ=1,2\n\ncar B: τ=7,8\n\ncar C: never for τ>=0\n\nSo combined, dangerous at τ=1,2,7,8.\n\nNow freeway 4,5,6,7: same cars.\n\nCars: (12,1,right,6) and (60,49,right,6)\n\nFirst car: h=12, τ_t=1, s=6\n\nτ_min = ceil( -h / s ) = ceil( -12 / 6 ) = ceil(-2) = -2\n\nτ_max = floor( -τ_t / s ) = floor( -1 / 6 ) = floor(-0.166) = -1\n\nBoth negative, so no danger for τ>=0.\n\nSecond car: h=60, τ_t=49, s=6\n\nτ_min = ceil(-60/6) = ceil(-10) = -10\n\nτ_max = floor(-49/6) = floor(-8.166) = -9\n\nNegative, no danger.\n\nSo for freeways 4,5,6,7, no car ever covers 0 for τ>=0. So always safe.\n\nIs that right?\n\nFirst car at τ=0: span [1,12], both >0, and moving right, so 0 never covered.\n\nSimilarly second car [49,60], always positive.\n\nSo yes, freeways 4,5,6,7 are always safe to be on.\n\nNow freeway 8: cars with speed 4.\n\nCars: (-24,-35,right,4), (52,41,right,4), (16,5,right,4)\n\nFirst car: h=-24, τ_t=-35, s=4\n\nτ_min = ceil( -h / s ) = ceil( -(-24)/4 ) = ceil(24/4) = ceil(6) =6\n\nτ_max = floor( -τ_t / s ) = floor( -(-35)/4 ) = floor(35/4) = floor(8.75) =8\n\nSo τ=6,7,8? τ from 6 to 8 inclusive.\n\nτ_min=6, τ_max=8, so τ=6,7,8.\n\nAt τ=6: A= τ_t + s τ = -35 + 4*6 = -35+24= -11, B= -24+24=0, [ -11,0], 0 in.\n\nτ=7: A=-35+28= -7, B=-24+28=4, [-7,4], 0 in.\n\nτ=8: A=-35+32= -3, B=-24+32=8, [-3,8], 0 in.\n\nSecond car: h=52, τ_t=41, s=4\n\nτ_min = ceil(-52/4) = ceil(-13) = -13\n\nτ_max = floor(-41/4) = floor(-10.25) = -11\n\nNegative, no danger.\n\nThird car: h=16, τ_t=5, s=4\n\nτ_min = ceil(-16/4) = ceil(-4) = -4\n\nτ_max = floor(-5/4) = floor(-1.25) = -2\n\nNegative, no danger.\n\nSo only first car causes danger at τ=6,7,8 for freeway 8.\n\nSummary of dangerous times for each freeway:\n\n- Freeway 1,2,3: dangerous at τ=1,2,7,8\n\n- Freeway 4,5,6,7: always safe (no danger)\n\n- Freeway 8: dangerous at τ=6,7,8\n\nτ is the time relative to t_1=10, so at turn T = t_1 + τ.\n\nPlayer starts at y=3 at τ=0.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nThe path: we can move up, down, or stay, but since we need to go up to 9, down might not help, but sometimes to avoid danger, we might wait or go down temporarily.\n\nBut since we want minimal turns, probably we go up as fast as possible, avoiding dangerous positions.\n\nCurrent position: at τ=0, y=3.\n\nNow, freeway y=3 is dangerous at τ=1,2,7,8.\n\nBut at τ=0, we are on y=3, but is it dangerous at τ=0? For y=3, at τ=0, is 0 covered?\n\nFor freeway 3 at τ=0: cars, as above, car A: [-17,-6], both negative, no; car B: [-53,-42], no; car C: [25,36], no. So at τ=0, y=3 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, for other freeways.\n\nWe need to plan the actions.\n\nActions at each turn: U, D, S, changing y.\n\ny must be integer between 0 and 9.\n\nGoal: reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nSince y=4,5,6,7 are always safe, we can be there any time.\n\ny=1,2,3 dangerous at τ=1,2,7,8\n\ny=8 dangerous at τ=6,7,8\n\ny=0 and y=9 safe.\n\nNow, starting from y=3 at τ=0.\n\nWe need to get to y=9.\n\nThe minimal number of moves: from y=3 to y=9, difference 6, so if we go up every turn, it takes 6 turns: τ=0 to τ=5, at τ=5 we reach y=9? Let's see.\n\nAt τ=0, position y=3.\n\nAfter action at τ=0, we move to next turn.\n\nTurn-based: at each turn t, we choose action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nLet me define the state at the beginning of turn.\n\nAt turn T, player is at position y_T.\n\nThen we choose action a_T, which determines y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy, with Δy based on a_T.\n\nThen at turn T, we are on freeway y_T, and we check collision based on the car spans at turn T.\n\nIn this case, at turn T=t_1 + τ, we are on y_τ, and check if 0 in span for freeway y_τ at time τ.\n\nThen after action, we go to y_{τ+1} at next turn.\n\nStart: at τ=0, turn t=10, position y=3.\n\nWe choose action a_{10}, which sets y_{11} = y_{10} + Δy.\n\nThen at turn τ=0, we are on y=3, which is freeway 3, and at τ=0, it is safe, as we saw.\n\nThen we move to next position.\n\nWe need to reach a state where at some turn, y_T =9.\n\nAnd for that turn, when we are on y=9, since no cars, it should be fine, but we need to be at (0,9) at some turn, and not collide during the path.\n\nCollision only when on freeways y=1 to 8.\n\nAt y=9, no issue.\n\nNow, to minimize H, the number of turns from start.\n\nH is the number of actions? Let's see.\n\n\"minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nSo actions from t=0 to H-1 relative, meaning H actions? Notation: {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}, so t from 0 to H-1, that's H actions.\n\nAfter H actions, we reach after H turns? Let's clarify.\n\nAt time t_1, we are at position.\n\nThen we perform actions at times t_1, t_1+1, ..., up to t_1 + H - 1.\n\nAfter action at t_1 + H - 1, we reach the position at turn t_1 + H.\n\nAnd at that point, we should be at (0,9).\n\nThe sequence of actions is for turns t_1 to t_1 + H - 1, H actions.\n\nThe position after H actions is at turn t_1 + H.\n\nAnd we need y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nDuring the turns t_1 to t_1 + H - 1, when we are on a freeway, we must not collide, meaning at each turn T from t_1 to t_1 + H - 1, when we are on y_T, it must be safe at that turn.\n\nAt turn T, position y_T, we perform action, then go to y_{T+1}.\n\nBut at turn T, we are on y_T, so collision check at T depends on y_T and the cars at T.\n\nThen after action, at T+1, we are on y_{T+1}, check collision there.\n\nThe last turn we care about is when we reach y=9, but at that turn, since y=9, no collision, so we don't need to check for collision when at y=9, I think, but we need to be at y=9 at some turn.\n\nIn the sequence, for the turn when we are at y=9, if it's a freeway, but y=9 is not a freeway with cars, freeways are 1-8, so y=9 is safe.\n\nSimilarly y=0 safe.\n\nSo, back to planning.\n\nWe start at τ=0, y=3.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at some τ.\n\nMinimal H: since from y=3 to y=9, need to increase by 6, each up move increases by 1, so minimum 6 up moves, but we can have stays or down, but that would take more turns, so probably we want exactly 6 up moves with no down or stay, but we have to avoid dangerous positions at certain times.\n\nThe dangerous times constrain when we can be on certain rows.\n\nList the safe times for each row:\n\ny=1: same as y=2,3? Freeways 1,2,3 all have same danger times? Freeway 1 is y=1, freeway 2 is y=2, etc.\n\nIn the grid, freeway k corresponds to row y=k.\n\nSo:\n\nRow y=1: dangerous at τ=1,2,7,8\n\nSimilarly y=2: same, τ=1,2,7,8\n\ny=3: τ=1,2,7,8\n\ny=4: always safe\n\ny=5: always safe\n\ny=6: always safe\n\ny=7: always safe\n\ny=8: dangerous at τ=6,7,8\n\ny=0 and y=9: always safe.\n\nNow, at τ=0, we are at y=3, which is safe since τ=0 not in {1,2,7,8}.\n\nWe need to get to y=9.\n\nThe direct way: go up every turn.\n\nStart: τ=0, y=3\n\nAction U: to y=4 at next turn.\n\nAfter action U at τ=0, y goes to 4 at τ=1.\n\nSequence:\n\nAt turn τ=0 (t=10): position y=3, choose action, say U, then y_{τ=1} =4\n\nAt turn τ=1 (t=11): position y=4, now y=4 is always safe, so no collision. Choose action, say U, then y_{τ=2}=5\n\nτ=2 (t=12): y=5, safe, U, to y=6\n\nτ=3 (t=13): y=6, safe, U, to y=7\n\nτ=4 (t=14): y=7, safe, U, to y=8\n\nτ=5 (t=15): y=8, now at τ=5, is y=8 safe?\n\ny=8 dangerous at τ=6,7,8\n\nτ=5 not in, so should be safe.\n\nAt τ=5, y=8.\n\nThen we need to go to y=9.\n\nAction U at τ=5, to y=9 at τ=6.\n\nNow at τ=6, we are at y=9, which is safe.\n\nBut we reached y=9 at τ=6, meaning at turn t_1 +6.\n\nNow, check if during the path, any collision.\n\nAt τ=0: y=3, safe (τ=0 not dangerous)\n\nAction U\n\nAt τ=1: y=4, safe\n\nAction U\n\nAt τ=2: y=5, safe\n\nAction U\n\nAt τ=3: y=6, safe\n\nAction U\n\nAt τ=4: y=7, safe\n\nAction U\n\nAt τ=5: y=8, now at τ=5, y=8 dangerous at τ=6,7,8, so τ=5 not dangerous, safe.\n\nAction U\n\nAt τ=6: y=9, safe.\n\nWe reached y=9 at τ=6.\n\nBut is this in minimal turns? From y=3 to y=9 in 6 moves, which is minimal since 6 steps.\n\nBut let's confirm the actions.\n\nActions from turn t_1 to t_1+5.\n\nt_1=10.\n\nAction at turn 10: U, to y=11? Positions: let's list turns.\n\nSet turn: at turn T, position y_T, action a_T determines y_{T+1}\n\nStart: turn 10, y=3\n\na_{10}: action at turn 10\n\nAfter a_{10}, y_{11} = y_{10} + Δy\n\nThen at turn 11, position y_{11}, we check collision based on cars at turn 11, which is τ=1.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nIn terms of τ:\n\nAt τ=0 (turn 10): y=3\n\nChoose a_{10}: U, then y_{11} = 3 +1 =4\n\nNow at turn 11, which is τ=1, position y=4\n\ny=4 at τ=1: y=4 is always safe, so no collision.\n\nThen a_{11}: U, y_{12} =4+1=5\n\nTurn 12, τ=2, y=5, safe\n\na_{12}: U, y_{13}=6\n\nTurn 13, τ=3, y=6, safe\n\na_{13}: U, y_{14}=7\n\nTurn 14, τ=4, y=7, safe\n\na_{14}: U, y_{15}=8\n\nTurn 15, τ=5, y=8\n\nNow y=8 at τ=5: dangerous at τ=6,7,8, τ=5 not in, so safe.\n\nThen a_{15}: U, y_{16}=9\n\nTurn 16, τ=6, y=9, safe, and we are at (0,9).\n\nSo in 6 turns: from turn 10 to 15 actions, and at turn 16 position y=9.\n\nH: number of actions, from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, so actions at 10,11,12,13,14,15: that's 6 actions, H=6.\n\nAfter H actions, position at turn t_1 + H.\n\nHere t_1 + H = 10 +6 =16, y=9.\n\nAnd during turns 10 to 15, we were on positions that were safe at those turns.\n\nTurn 10: τ=0, y=3, safe\n\nTurn 11: τ=1, y=4, safe\n\nTurn 12: τ=2, y=5, safe\n\nTurn 13: τ=3, y=6, safe\n\nTurn 14: τ=4, y=7, safe\n\nTurn 15: τ=5, y=8, safe\n\nAll good.\n\nBut is there a problem? y=8 at τ=5 is safe, but we go to y=9 at τ=6.\n\nNow, what about the dangerous times? For example, at τ=1,2,7,8, y=1,2,3 are dangerous, but we were not on them at those times.\n\nAt τ=1, we were on y=4, safe.\n\nSimilarly, at τ=6,7,8, y=8 is dangerous, but at τ=6, we are on y=9, not y=8.\n\nAt τ=6, y=9, not on freeway.\n\ny=8 dangerous at τ=6, but we are not on it.\n\nSo all fine.\n\nBut is this minimal? H=6 seems minimal since we need 6 up moves.\n\nBut perhaps we can do with stays or something, but that would increase H.\n\nSo H=6 should be achievable.\n\nBut in the sequence above, it seems to work.\n\nBut let's double-check if at some point we might be forced to be dangerous.\n\nFor example, at τ=5, we are on y=8, which is safe, then move to y=9 at τ=6.\n\nNow, if we had to be on y=8 at τ=6, it would be dangerous, but we are not.\n\nSimilarly, for lower rows.\n\nBut in this path, we are on y=3 only at τ=0, safe; then y=4 at τ=1, safe; etc.\n\ny=4 at τ=1 is fine.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), and we did in 6 turns.\n\nBut the answer format should be the actions.\n\nBut let's see if we can do faster? From y=3 to y=9 in 5 turns? Only if we move up faster, but each action changes by at most 1, so impossible to reach in less than 6 turns. Minimum 6 actions with all U.\n\nWith down or stay, it takes more, so H=6 is minimum.\n\nSo the sequence should be all U.\n\nBut actions: from turn 10 to 15, all U.\n\nBut let's write the actions.\n\nAnswer:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} = U\n\nTurn t_1 +1: a_{t_1+1} = U\n\n...\n\nUp to turn t_1 +5: a_{t_1+5} = U\n\nt_1=10.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 10: a_{10} = U\n\nTurn 11: a_{11} = U\n\nTurn 12: a_{12} = U\n\nTurn 13: a_{13} = U\n\nTurn 14: a_{14} = U\n\nTurn 15: a_{15} = U\n\nAnd at turn 16, we are at y=9.\n\nH=6.\n\nBut in the action sequence, it's from t=0 to H-1 relative, so for t from 0 to 5, actions at t_1 + t.\n\nIn the box, it should be:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\n\nTurn t_1 +1: a_{t_1+1}\n\n...\n\nTurn t_1 + (H-1): a_{t_1 + H-1}\n\nHere H-1=5, so up to turn 15.\n\nNow, but in the car states, for freeway 8, at τ=6,7,8 dangerous, but we are not on it.\n\nBut just to be thorough, is there any issue with the move?\n\nAnother thing: when we move, at the turn we move, we are on the current row, and we move to the next row at next turn.\n\nFor example, at turn τ=5, we are on y=8, safe, then we move to y=9 at τ=6.\n\nAt τ=6, we are on y=9, not on freeway.\n\nBut suppose at some turn we are on a row that is dangerous, but in this case, no.\n\nPerhaps for y=8 at τ=5, is it safe? Yes.\n\nBut let me confirm the car positions for y=8 at τ=5.\n\nFreeway 8, at τ=5 relative to t_1.\n\nτ=5, turn t=10+5=15.\n\nCars: first car: at τ=5, span [τ_t + s τ, h + s τ] = [-35 + 4*5, -24 + 4*5] = [-35+20, -24+20] = [-15, -4], both negative, so 0 not in, safe.\n\nOther cars not covering.\n\nSimilarly, at τ=6, it would be [-35+24, -24+24] = [-11,0], 0 included, dangerous.\n\nBut we are not on y=8 at τ=6.\n\nSo fine.\n\nIn the sequence, we have to output the actions.\n\nBut in the initial state, at turn t_1=10, position (0,3), and we need to start with action.\n\nPerhaps we can do with staying or something, but no need.\n\nBut in this case, it seems straightforward.\n\nBut why is freeway 4,5,6,7 always safe? Yes, as we saw.\n\nBut in the table, freeway 4,5,6,7 have cars, but they never cover x=0 for τ>=0.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nBut just to be sure, for freeway 4: cars (12,1,right,6) at τ=0: [1,12], at τ=1: [1+6,12+6]=[7,18], etc, always positive, never 0.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think the sequence is fine.\n\nBut the player starts at (0,3), and we go up to (0,9).\n\nBut in the action, we need to specify for each turn.\n\nPerhaps we can reach earlier? No, minimum 6 turns.\n\nMaybe by going down first or something, but that would take more turns.\n\nFor example, if we stay at y=3, but at τ=1 or 2, y=3 is dangerous, so we cannot stay.\n\nBut in this path, we leave immediately.\n\nAt τ=0, we could go down to y=2, but y=2 at τ=0 is safe? y=2 at τ=0.\n\nτ=0, for y=2, freeway 2, at τ=0, same as y=3 at τ=0, safe, but if we go down to y=2, then at τ=1, y=2 is dangerous, so we have to move away before τ=1.\n\nBut going down would make us go to y=2 at τ=1? Let's see.\n\nIf at τ=0, y=3, action D, then y_{τ=1} = 2.\n\nThen at τ=1, y=2, which is dangerous, collision.\n\nSo we cannot go down.\n\nSimilarly, action S, stay at y=3, then at τ=1, y=3, dangerous.\n\nSo at τ=0, we must go up, to y=4, to avoid being on y=3 at τ=1.\n\nSimilarly, for other points.\n\nIn our sequence, we go up immediately.\n\nAfter that, all up.\n\nBut at τ=5, we are on y=8, which is safe, then up to y=9.\n\nCould we reach y=9 earlier? No.\n\nSuppose we go faster, but cannot.\n\nOr, go to y=8 earlier, but y=8 at τ=6,7,8 is dangerous, so we cannot be on y=8 at those times.\n\nIn our sequence, we are on y=8 at τ=5, which is safe.\n\nIf we reach y=8 earlier, say at τ=4, then we can go to y=9 at τ=5.\n\nBut can we reach y=8 at τ=4?\n\nFrom start, at τ=0, y=3.\n\nAfter 4 up moves: actions at τ=0,1,2,3 U, then y at τ=4 would be y=3 +4 =7? Positions:\n\nAfter action at τ=0: to y=4 at τ=1\n\nAction at τ=1: to y=5 at τ=2\n\nAction at τ=2: to y=6 at τ=3\n\nAction at τ=3: to y=7 at τ=4\n\nSo at τ=4, y=7.\n\nThen to go to y=8, action U at τ=4, to y=8 at τ=5, same as before.\n\nIf we want y=8 at τ=4, we need to be at y=7 at τ=3, but from y=3 at τ=0, to y=7 at τ=3, that requires 4 up moves in 3 actions? Not possible.\n\nTime: at τ=0, y=3\n\nAfter 1 action: at τ=1, y=4 (if U)\n\nAfter 2 actions: at τ=2, y=5\n\nAfter 3 actions: at τ=3, y=6\n\nAfter 4 actions: at τ=4, y=7\n\nAfter 5 actions: at τ=5, y=8\n\nAfter 6 actions: at τ=6, y=9\n\nCannot reach y=8 before τ=5.\n\nAt τ=5, y=8 is safe, as we have.\n\nIf we go directly, it works.\n\nBut we have to avoid y=8 at τ=6,7,8, which we do.\n\nAnother thing: at τ=7,8, y=1,2,3 dangerous, but we are not there.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 6, with all up actions.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nIn the answer format, it should be with t_1.\n\nSince t_1=10.\n\nSo:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 10: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 14: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 15: & U \\end{array} }\n\nBut let's write it as specified.\n\n\"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} = U\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1} = U\n\nTurn t_1 + 2: a_{t_1 + 2} = U\n\nTurn t_1 + 3: a_{t_1 + 3} = U\n\nTurn t_1 + 4: a_{t_1 + 4} = U\n\nTurn t_1 + 5: a_{t_1 + 5} = U\n\nAnd H=6.\n\nIn the sequence, it's from t=0 to H-1=5, so t_1 to t_1+5.\n\nYes.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\", but in the box, probably just the sequence with turns.\n\nIn the answer format, it shows the actions for each turn.\n\nSo I think we're good.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 3) at turn \\(t_1 = 10\\). The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis of Car Movements and Safe Times\nThe cars on each freeway move right, and their positions are updated based on the turn relative to \\(t_1 = 10\\). Define \\(\\tau = T - t_1\\), where \\(T\\) is the absolute turn number. Collision occurs at turn \\(T\\) if the player is on freeway \\(y_T\\) and the span of any car on that freeway includes \\(x = 0\\) at that turn.\n\n- **Freeways 1, 2, and 3**: Dangerous at \\(\\tau = 1, 2, 7, 8\\) (due to cars covering \\(x=0\\) at these times).\n- **Freeways 4, 5, 6, and 7**: Always safe (cars never cover \\(x=0\\) for \\(\\tau \\geq 0\\)).\n- **Freeway 8**: Dangerous at \\(\\tau = 6, 7, 8\\) (due to one car covering \\(x=0\\) at these times).\n- **Rows \\(y = 0\\) and \\(y = 9\\)**: Always safe (no cars).\n\n### Path to Reach \\(y = 9\\) Minimally\n- From \\(y = 3\\) to \\(y = 9\\), a minimum of 6 upward moves (U) are required, as each move changes \\(y\\) by at most 1.\n- At \\(\\tau = 0\\) (turn 10), the player is at \\(y = 3\\), which is safe since \\(\\tau = 0\\) is not dangerous for \\(y = 3\\).\n- Moving up to \\(y = 4\\) at \\(\\tau = 1\\) (turn 11) is safe, as \\(y = 4\\) is always safe.\n- Continuing up through \\(y = 5, 6, 7\\) at \\(\\tau = 2, 3, 4\\) (turns 12, 13, 14) is safe, as these rows are always safe.\n- At \\(\\tau = 5\\) (turn 15), moving to \\(y = 8\\) is safe, as \\(\\tau = 5\\) is not dangerous for \\(y = 8\\).\n- Moving to \\(y = 9\\) at \\(\\tau = 6\\) (turn 16) is safe, as \\(y = 9\\) has no cars.\n\nThis path takes exactly 6 turns (actions) from turn 10 to turn 15, reaching \\(y = 9\\) at turn 16. No shorter path is possible, as 6 moves are required to increase \\(y\\) by 6. Down (D) or stay (S) actions would increase \\(H\\) and are unnecessary.\n\n### Action Sequence\n- At turn 10 (\\(\\tau = 0\\)): Action U moves to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 11. Position at turn 10 is safe.\n- At turn 11 (\\(\\tau = 1\\)): Action U moves to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 12. Position at turn 11 (\\(y = 4\\)) is safe.\n- At turn 12 (\\(\\tau = 2\\)): Action U moves to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 13. Position at turn 12 (\\(y = 5\\)) is safe.\n- At turn 13 (\\(\\tau = 3\\)): Action U moves to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 14. Position at turn 13 (\\(y = 6\\)) is safe.\n- At turn 14 (\\(\\tau = 4\\)): Action U moves to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 15. Position at turn 14 (\\(y = 7\\)) is safe.\n- At turn 15 (\\(\\tau = 5\\)): Action U moves to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 16. Position at turn 15 (\\(y = 8\\)) is safe (since \\(\\tau = 5\\) is not dangerous for \\(y = 8\\)).\n\nThe player reaches (0, 9) at turn 16 with \\(H = 6\\) actions.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 10: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 14: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 15: & U \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 12, and the player is at (0,5). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns H, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nThe player can move up (U: y+1), down (D: y-1), or stay (S: y same). Note that the grid has y in [0,9], so we cannot go below 0 or above 9.\n\nThe car update: all cars are moving right (since direction is 'right')? Actually, note the description:\n  - Left-moving: span becomes [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\n  - Right-moving: span becomes [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]   ??? Wait, let me check the problem.\n\nActually, the problem says:\n  For left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, tau] -> Span(T) = [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\n  For right-moving: Span(t1) = [tau, h] -> Span(T) = [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut note: in the car state table, the cars are given as (head, tail, direction, speed). For right-moving, the head should be greater than the tail? But in the given data, we see for freeway 1: (6, -5, right, 6). \n  Since it's right-moving, the span at t1 is [tail, head] = [-5, 6]? But the problem says for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [tau, h]\". So the car is from tau to h, and since it's right-moving, the head is the front? Then at time T, the car moves to [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, the head is the front? and the car moves to [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)].\n\nBut in our problem, all cars are right-moving? The direction is given as \"right\". So we only use the right-moving update.\n\nCollision condition: at turn T, if the player is at (0, y_T) and there is a car on freeway y_T such that 0 is in the span of that car at time T? Actually, the problem says: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T\".\n\nImportant note: when you are at position (0, y_T) at turn T, then you are on freeway y_T at turn T. And if at that same turn T, any car on freeway y_T has its span containing 0, then collision.\n\nAlso note: when you move from y_T to y_{T+1} at turn T, then at turn T you are still on y_T, and at turn T+1 you are on y_{T+1}. So at turn T, we check the car on freeway y_T.\n\nWe start at turn t1=12, at (0,5). We are at freeway 5 at turn 12.\n\nWe must avoid being at a freeway y (from 1 to 8) at a turn T when there is a car on freeway y that has 0 in its span at time T.\n\nWe are to compute for each future turn T (starting at T=12) the positions of the cars on each freeway? But note: we only care about the freeway we are on at that turn.\n\nHowever, to plan the path, we need to know for each freeway and each future turn T, whether there is a car on that freeway that has 0 in its span at T.\n\nBut note: the problem gives the car state at turn t1=12. So for a future turn T, the car on freeway k that had initial (at t1) span [tau, h] (if right) will be at [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n\nWe are to check if 0 is in the interval [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n\nSince the cars are long, and they are moving, we need to compute for each car and for each turn T (relative to t1) whether 0 is in the car's span at T.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T\". So we must avoid that.\n\nWe are starting at y=5 at turn 12. We can only change by -1,0,1 per turn.\n\nWe need to get to y=9. The minimal number of turns? Without any cars, we would go up 4 times: from 5 to 9 in 4 moves. But we must avoid the cars.\n\nWe must check for each freeway and for each turn if we are going to be on that freeway at that turn, then we must ensure that at that turn, no car on that freeway has 0 in its span.\n\nWe are going to simulate the path from turn 12 onwards. We need to compute the car positions at each future turn.\n\nLet t = T - t1, so t=0 at turn 12.\n\nFor a car on freeway k with initial (at t1=12) parameters: (head, tail, direction, speed) = (h, tau, d, s). Since all are right-moving, we have:\n\n  Span at time T = [tau + s*(T-12), h + s*(T-12)]\n\nWe need 0 to be NOT in [tau + s*(T-12), h + s*(T-12)] for the freeway we are on at turn T.\n\nNow, note that the car spans are given for freeways 1 to 8. Freeway 0 and 9 are not mentioned? But the player can be at y=0 and y=9. The problem says: \"avoid collisions with cars on freeways y = 1, ..., 8\". So when the player is at y=0 or y=9, there are no cars? So we are safe at y=0 and y=9? \n\nBut note: we start at (0,5) and we must reach (0,9). So the goal is at y=9, which is safe.\n\nNow, let's list the cars per freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: three cars: \n  (6, -5, right, 6) -> span at T: [-5+6*(T-12), 6+6*(T-12)] = [6T-72-5, 6T-72+6] = [6T-77, 6T-66]\n  (-30, -41, right, 6) -> [-41+6*(T-12), -30+6*(T-12)] = [6T-72-41, 6T-72-30] = [6T-113, 6T-102]\n  (48,37,right,6) -> [37+6*(T-12), 48+6*(T-12)] = [6T-72+37, 6T-72+48] = [6T-35, 6T-24]\n\nFreeway 2: same as freeway 1? \n  The table says: \n  | 2 | (6, -5, right, 6), (-30, -41, right, 6), (48, 37, right, 6) | \n  So same as freeway 1.\n\nFreeway 3: same.\n\nFreeway 4: two cars:\n  (24,13,right,6) -> [13+6*(T-12), 24+6*(T-12)] = [6T-72+13, 6T-72+24] = [6T-59, 6T-48]\n  (-42,-53,right,6) -> [-53+6*(T-12), -42+6*(T-12)] = [6T-72-53, 6T-72-42] = [6T-125, 6T-114]\n\nFreeway 5: same as freeway 4? \n  | 5 | (24,13,right,6), (-42,-53,right,6) | \n\nFreeway 6: same.\n\nFreeway 7: same.\n\nFreeway 8: three cars:\n  (-16,-27,right,4) -> [-27+4*(T-12), -16+4*(T-12)] = [4T-48-27, 4T-48-16] = [4T-75, 4T-64]\n  (60,49,right,4) -> [49+4*(T-12), 60+4*(T-12)] = [4T-48+49, 4T-48+60] = [4T+1, 4T+12]\n  (24,13,right,4) -> [13+4*(T-12), 24+4*(T-12)] = [4T-48+13, 4T-48+24] = [4T-35, 4T-24]\n\nWe are at turn T=12 (t=0) at y=5.\n\nWe must avoid being at freeway k (for k=1..8) at turn T if 0 is in any of the car spans on freeway k at that T.\n\nWe want to get to y=9 as quickly as possible. The minimal H is at least 4 (if we go up every turn). Let's check if we can go straight up from turn 12 to turn 15 (4 moves: 12->13->14->15->16) and be at y=9 at turn 16.\n\nBut we must check for each turn T in [12,15] (because at turn 16 we are at y=9, which is safe) the freeway we are on:\n\nTurn 12: y=5 -> freeway 5.\n  Check freeway 5 at T=12: \n    Car1: [6*12-59, 6*12-48] = [72-59,72-48] = [13,24] -> 0 not in [13,24]\n    Car2: [6*12-125, 6*12-114] = [72-125,72-114] = [-53,-42] -> 0 not in [-53,-42]\n  So safe.\n\nTurn 13: we move to y=6? (if we choose U at turn12) -> then at turn13 we are at freeway 6.\n  Check freeway6 at T=13: \n    Freeway6 has the same cars as freeway5? \n    Actually, freeway6 has the same cars as freeway4: \n        Car1: [6*13-59, 6*13-48] = [78-59,78-48] = [19,30] -> 0 not in [19,30]\n        Car2: [6*13-125, 6*13-114] = [78-125,78-114] = [-47,-36] -> 0 not in [-47,-36]\n    So safe.\n\nTurn 14: we move to y=7 (if U at turn13) -> freeway7 at T=14.\n  Freeway7: same as freeway4? \n        Car1: [6*14-59, 6*14-48] = [84-59,84-48] = [25,36] -> safe.\n        Car2: [6*14-125, 6*14-114] = [84-125,84-114] = [-41,-30] -> safe.\n\nTurn 15: we move to y=8 (if U at turn14) -> freeway8 at T=15.\n  Check freeway8 at T=15:\n        Car1: [4*15-75, 4*15-64] = [60-75,60-64] = [-15,-4] -> 0 not in? Actually, -15 to -4 -> negative, so 0 not in.\n        Car2: [4*15+1, 4*15+12] = [61,72] -> safe (positive)\n        Car3: [4*15-35, 4*15-24] = [60-35,60-24] = [25,36] -> safe.\n  So safe.\n\nThen at turn16, we move to y=9 (if U at turn15) -> then we are at y=9 at turn16, which is safe.\n\nSo the sequence: \n  Turn12: U -> y=6 at turn13\n  Turn13: U -> y=7 at turn14\n  Turn14: U -> y=8 at turn15\n  Turn15: U -> y=9 at turn16\n\nBut wait, at turn12 we start at y=5. After U at turn12, at the next state (turn13) we are at y=6.\n\nHowever, we must check the entire path: at each turn T, the player is at the freeway of the starting y of that turn? Actually, the problem says: at turn T, the player is at (0, y_T). Then we check the freeway y_T at time T.\n\nIn our plan:\n\nTurn12: we are at y=5 (freeway5) at time12 -> safe.\nTurn13: we are at y=6 (freeway6) at time13 -> safe.\nTurn14: we are at y=7 (freeway7) at time14 -> safe.\nTurn15: we are at y=8 (freeway8) at time15 -> safe.\n\nThen at turn16, we are at y=9 -> safe (no cars).\n\nSo with H=4 turns (from turn12 to turn15: 4 actions: U, U, U, U) and we reach y=9 at turn16.\n\nBut wait, the problem says: we start at turn t1=12, and we do actions for t=0 to H-1. So:\n\n  t=0 (turn12): action a12 -> then at turn13 we are at y13 = y12 + (action effect)\n  ...\n  t=H-1: last action at turn12+H-1, and then at the next state (turn12+H) we are at y=9.\n\nSo we do H actions, and we are at y=9 at turn12+H.\n\nIn our case, we did 4 actions: at turn12,13,14,15 -> then at turn16 we are at y=9. So H=4.\n\nBut let me double-check the car at freeway8 at turn15: \n  Car1: [4*15-75, 4*15-64] = [60-75,60-64] = [-15,-4] -> doesn't contain 0? Correct.\n  Car2: [4*15+1, 4*15+12] = [61,72] -> doesn't contain 0.\n  Car3: [4*15-35, 4*15-24] = [25,36] -> doesn't contain 0.\n\nHowever, note that the car2 on freeway8: at T=15, the span is [4*15+1, 4*15+12] = [61,72]. But wait, the initial at t1=12: (60,49,right,4) -> but wait, the head and tail: \n  The problem says for right-moving: initial span is [tau, head] = [49,60] at T=12? Then at T=15: [49+4*(15-12), 60+4*(15-12)] = [49+12, 60+12] = [61,72] -> that matches.\n\nBut what about at T=16? We don't care because we are not on freeway8 at T=16.\n\nSo the plan seems safe.\n\nBut wait, the freeway5 at T=12: \n  The car (24,13,right,6) -> at T=12: [13+6*0, 24+6*0] = [13,24] -> safe.\n  The car (-42,-53,right,6) -> at T=12: [-53+0, -42+0] = [-53,-42] -> safe.\n\nBut note: the initial state for freeway5 is given at turn12, so we are safe.\n\nHowever, I notice that the freeway1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 have the same cars? Actually, freeway1,2,3 have the same set, freeway4,5,6,7 have the same set, and freeway8 is different.\n\nBut in our path we only go through freeway5 (turn12), freeway6 (turn13), freeway7 (turn14), freeway8 (turn15). And we checked each.\n\nBut wait, what about freeway5 at turn12: we are safe. But what if we stay? We are not staying, but if we did, we would have to check again.\n\nBut in our plan we are moving up.\n\nHowever, let me check if there is any danger at freeway8 at other times? We are only at freeway8 at turn15.\n\nBut note: the problem says that when we are at a freeway at a particular turn, we only check that turn. So we are safe.\n\nBut wait: is there a possibility that a car might cover 0 at a different turn? For example, at freeway8 at T=16? But we are not there at T=16.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 4.\n\nBut the problem says: \"determine the minimal number of turns H\". And we found a path with H=4.\n\nBut let me see if we can do it in 3? \n  To get from y=5 to y=9 in 3 moves: we need to move up 4 steps in 3 moves? That's impossible because each move can only be +1 at most. So 3 moves: maximum we can get to y=5+3=8. Then we are at y=8 at turn15? Then we haven't reached y=9. So we need at least 4 moves.\n\nThus, the minimal H is 4.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: U\n\nBut note: at turn15 we do U, and then at the next state (turn16) we are at y=9. So we have done 4 actions and reached at turn16.\n\nBut the problem says: we start at turn12 (current turn) and we do actions for t=0 to H-1. So we do actions at turn12,13,14,15 (which are t=0,1,2,3) and then at turn16 (which is t=4) we are at y=9. So H=4.\n\nThe answer format:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: U\n}\n\nBut wait, let me double-check freeway8 at T=15 again. The car1: [4T-75, 4T-64] at T=15: [60-75,60-64] = [-15,-4] -> this is negative, so 0 is not in the interval? Correct.\n\nBut note: the interval [-15,-4] is from -15 to -4, which does not include 0.\n\nHowever, what if the interval includes 0? For example, if we had a car that at T=15 had span [-5,5], then 0 is in that interval.\n\nBut we don't have that.\n\nBut wait, there is a car on freeway8: the second car is [4T+1, 4T+12] at T=15: [61,72] -> positive.\n\nBut what about the third car: [4T-35,4T-24] at T=15: [60-35,60-24]=[25,36] -> positive.\n\nAnd the first car: negative.\n\nSo safe.\n\nBut what about freeway5 at T=12: \n  First car: [6*12-59, 6*12-48] = [72-59,72-48]=[13,24] -> positive, so 0 not in.\n  Second car: [6*12-125, 6*12-114]=[72-125,72-114]=[-53,-42] -> negative, so 0 not in.\n\nFreeway6 at T=13: \n  First car: [6*13-59, 6*13-48]=[78-59,78-48]=[19,30] -> safe.\n  Second car: [6*13-125, 6*13-114]=[78-125,78-114]=[-47,-36] -> safe.\n\nFreeway7 at T=14: \n  [6*14-59, 6*14-48]=[84-59,84-48]=[25,36] -> safe.\n  [6*14-125,6*14-114]=[84-125,84-114]=[-41,-30] -> safe.\n\nSo all safe.\n\nBut wait, the freeway1,2,3 have the same cars as freeway1? But we don't go there.\n\nHowever, just to be thorough, what if we had to go through freeway1? But we don't.\n\nTherefore, the plan is safe.\n\nBut note: the problem says the initial state for freeway8 has three cars: (-16,-27,right,4), (60,49,right,4), (24,13,right,4). \n\nWe have computed the third car as (24,13,right,4) -> at T=15: [13+4*(15-12), 24+4*(15-12)] = [13+12,24+12]=[25,36]. But wait, the initial head and tail: for right-moving, the initial span is [tail, head] = [13,24]? Then at T=15: [13+4*3, 24+4*3] = [13+12,24+12]=[25,36]. Correct.\n\nBut why did I write [4T-35,4T-24]? \n  Because: [13+4*(T-12)] = 13+4T-48 = 4T-35, and 24+4*(T-12)=24+4T-48=4T-24. So at T=15: 4*15-35=60-35=25, 4*15-24=60-24=36. Correct.\n\nSo the answer is four U's.\n\nBut the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\". So from t1=12 to t1+3=15.\n\nThus, the actions are at turn12,13,14,15.\n\nBut the player starts at (0,5) at turn12. After the first U (turn12), at turn13 the player is at (0,6). Then at turn13: U -> turn14: (0,7). Then at turn14: U -> turn15: (0,8). Then at turn15: U -> turn16: (0,9). So we reach at turn16.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 4.\n\nSo the answer:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: U\n}\n\nBut note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and we have H=4.\n\nBut let me see if there is any constraint that forces a longer path? For example, if at some point we had to wait? But we don't.\n\nHowever, what if we try to go faster? But we cannot.\n\nSo this is minimal.\n\nBut wait, what if we go down? That would make the path longer, so not minimal.\n\nTherefore, we output the above.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 5)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 12\\) is 4. The sequence of actions is:\n\n- At turn 12, move up (U) to \\(y = 6\\).\n- At turn 13, move up (U) to \\(y = 7\\).\n- At turn 14, move up (U) to \\(y = 8\\).\n- At turn 15, move up (U) to \\(y = 9\\).\n\nThis path avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) at each turn:\n\n- **Turn 12 (y = 5)**: Cars on freeway 5 have spans \\([13, 24]\\) and \\([-53, -42]\\). 0 is not in either span.\n- **Turn 13 (y = 6)**: Cars on freeway 6 have spans \\([19, 30]\\) and \\([-47, -36]\\). 0 is not in either span.\n- **Turn 14 (y = 7)**: Cars on freeway 7 have spans \\([25, 36]\\) and \\([-41, -30]\\). 0 is not in either span.\n- **Turn 15 (y = 8)**: Cars on freeway 8 have spans \\([-15, -4]\\), \\([61, 72]\\), and \\([25, 36]\\). 0 is not in any span.\n\nThe position at turn 16 is \\((0, 9)\\), which is safe as there are no cars on freeway 9. This path achieves the goal in the minimal \\(H = 4\\) turns.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 12: U \\\\\nTurn 13: U \\\\\nTurn 14: U \\\\\nTurn 15: U\n}",

The current turn is t₁ = 13, and the player is at y=6.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how the cars move. All cars are moving right, according to the car state table. For right-moving cars, the span at time T is [τ + s(T - t₁), h + s(T - t₁)], where h and τ are the head and tail at time t₁.\n\nThe collision happens if at turn T, when the player is at position (0, y_T), and for the freeway i = y_T, there is a car such that 0 is in its span at that turn. That is, if min(span) ≤ 0 ≤ max(span) for some car on row y_T at time T.\n\nAlso, note that when you move to a new row, you're not on that row until the next turn. So at turn T, if you move from y_T to y_{T+1}, you are only on row y_T during turn T, and you arrive at y_{T+1} at the start of turn T+1. So for collision, at turn T, you are on row y_T, so we check cars on row y_T at time T.\n\nThe key point is that the player position changes at the end of the turn, but the collision is checked during the turn when you are on a specific row.\n\nLet me denote the current time as t = 0 for simplicity, so t₁ = 0. Then at time t (turn t), player is at y_t.\n\nSet t_current = t₁ = 13. But to make it easier, I'll set t=0 as the current turn, so actions from t=0 to t=H-1, and at t=H-1, y should be 9.\n\nStart at t=0, y=6.\n\nGoal: reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nActions: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), S (stay, y same).\n\ny must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nNow, the cars: all freeways from 1 to 8 have cars moving right.\n\nLet me list the car spans at time t (relative to t₁=0).\n\nFor each freeway k, and for each car, given (h, τ, d, s) at t=0.\n\nd is direction, all are right, so for right-moving, span at time t is [τ + s*t, h + s*t]\n\nBecause at t=0, span is [τ, h], and moves right, so increases by s per turn.\n\nNow, collision at time t if player is on row i, and for row i, there is a car where 0 is in [τ + s*t, h + s*t]\n\nThat is, τ + s*t ≤ 0 ≤ h + s*t\n\nSince for right-moving, τ is left, h is right, so τ ≤ h, so span is [τ, h] increasing.\n\nSo condition: τ + s*t ≤ 0 ≤ h + s*t\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but all are right here.\n\nNow, let's list for each row the cars and their τ, h, s at t=0.\n\nFrom the table:\n\nRow 1: three cars: (h=12, τ=1, d=right, s=6), (h=-24? Wait no, head h, tail τ.\n\nFirst car: head=12, tail=1, so at t=0, span [1,12]\n\nSecond car: head=-24? That can't be right. Head is position, I think.\n\nLook: \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nFor row 1: (12,1,right,6), so head=12, tail=1, so at t=0, span [1,12] since right-moving, τ=1, h=12.\n\nThen (-24,-35,right,6), head=-24, tail=-35? Tail should be less than head for right-moving, I think.\n\n-35 < -24, so tail=-35, head=-24, so span [-35,-24] at t=0.\n\nSimilarly, (54,43,right,6), head=54, tail=43, span [43,54] at t=0.\n\nSimilarly for other rows.\n\nBut for collision, we care about when 0 is in the span.\n\nAlso, row 2 and 3 have same cars as row 1? According to table:\n\nRow 1: (12,1,right,6), (-24,-35,right,6), (54,43,right,6)\n\nRow 2: same (12,1,right,6), (-24,-35,right,6), (54,43,right,6)\n\nRow 3: same\n\nRow 4: (30,19,right,6), (-36,-47,right,6)  // only two cars\n\nRow 5: same as row 4\n\nRow 6: same\n\nRow 7: same\n\nRow 8: (-12,-23,right,4), (-48,-59,right,4), (28,17,right,4) with s=4\n\nNow, for each row, I need to find when there is a collision possible, i.e., when for some car, τ + s*t ≤ 0 ≤ h + s*t\n\nSince all moving right, s>0.\n\nSo for a given row and car, the time t when 0 is covered: τ + s*t ≤ 0 ≤ h + s*t\n\nWhich implies -h/s ≤ t ≤ -τ/s ? Let's solve inequalities.\n\nτ + s*t ≤ 0 ≤ h + s*t\n\nFrom left: τ + s*t ≤ 0 ⇒ t ≤ -τ/s\n\nFrom right: 0 ≤ h + s*t ⇒ t ≥ -h/s\n\nSince s>0.\n\nAlso, since τ ≤ h, -h/s ≤ -τ/s, so t must satisfy: ceil(-h/s) ≤ t ≤ floor(-τ/s) ? t is integer, turns.\n\nt is integer, so we need to find t such that max( ceil(-h/s), something) but let's compute the interval.\n\nt must satisfy: -h/s ≤ t ≤ -τ/s\n\nSince t integer, t from ceil(-h/s) to floor(-τ/s), inclusive, if ceil(-h/s) <= floor(-τ/s), else no collision at that car.\n\nThen for a row, if any car has such t, collision at that t.\n\nBut we need to know for each row and each time, whether it is occupied or not.\n\nFirst, let's list for each row the cars and their parameters.\n\nStart with row 1:\n\nCars:\n\nCar A: h=12, τ=1, s=6\n\nSo -h/s = -12/6 = -2, -τ/s = -1/6 ≈ -0.166, so t ≥ ceil(-2) = -2, t ≤ floor(-0.166) = -1? floor(-0.166) = -1 since -1 > -0.166? No.\n\nt ≥ ceil(-h/s) = ceil(-12/6) = ceil(-2) = -2\n\nt ≤ floor(-τ/s) = floor(-1/6) = floor(-0.166) = -1  (since floor is greatest integer less than or equal, -1 < -0.166? No, -1 is less than -0.166, but -0.166 is greater than -1.\n\nNumbers: -12/6 = -2 exactly.\n\n-τ/s = -1/6 ≈ -0.1667\n\nt must satisfy t ≥ -h/s = -2\n\nt ≤ -τ/s = -1/6 ≈ -0.1667\n\nSince t integer, t ≤ -1? Because t must be <= -0.1667, so t <= -1 since t integer, t <= -1.\n\nAnd t >= -2.\n\nSo t = -2, -1\n\nFor t = -2: check -h/s = -2, t >= -2, so t=-2 >= -2, true.\n\nt <= -1/6 ≈ -0.166, t=-2 <= -0.166? -2 < -0.166, true.\n\nSimilarly for t=-1: t=-1 >= -2, true; t=-1 <= -0.166, -1 <= -0.166 true? -1 = -1.0 < -0.166, yes.\n\n-1.0 < -0.166, so yes.\n\nBut t is time relative to t₁=0, so t=-2 and t=-1 are in the past, before current turn. At current turn t=0, is there collision?\n\nFor t=0: t=0, -h/s = -2, 0 >= -2 true; 0 <= -1/6 ≈ -0.166? 0 <= -0.166? No, 0 > -0.166, so false. So not for t=0.\n\nSimilarly, for other cars.\n\nCar B: h=-24, τ=-35, s=6\n\n- h/s = -(-24)/6? -h/s = -(-24)/6? h=-24, so -h/s = -(-24)/6 = 24/6 = 4\n\n-τ/s = -(-35)/6 = 35/6 ≈ 5.833\n\nt >= ceil(-h/s) = ceil(4) =4\n\nt <= floor(-τ/s) = floor(35/6) = floor(5.833) =5\n\nSo t=4,5\n\nCar C: h=54, τ=43, s=6\n\n- h/s = -54/6 = -9\n\n-τ/s = -43/6 ≈ -7.166\n\nt >= ceil(-9) = -9\n\nt <= floor(-7.166) = -8? floor(-7.166) = -8? No, floor is down, -8 < -7.166 < -7, so floor(-7.166) = -8? No.\n\n-7.166, integers: -8 < -7.166 < -7, so floor is -8, since greatest integer less than or equal, -8 <= -7.166, and -7 > -7.166 not less.\n\nfloor(-7.166) = -8\n\nSimilarly, ceil(-7.166) = -7\n\nBut here t <= floor(-τ/s) = floor(-43/6) = floor(-7.166) = -8\n\nt >= ceil(-h/s) = ceil(-54/6) = ceil(-9) = -9\n\nSo t from -9 to -8 inclusive.\n\nAll in past.\n\nFor row 1, at current time t=0, no car has 0 in span? Let's check car A: at t=0, span [1 +6*0, 12+6*0] = [1,12], 0 not in [1,12]\n\nCar B: span [-35 +0, -24+0] = [-35,-24], 0 not in\n\nCar C: [43,54], not.\n\nAnd for future, car B will have t=4,5: at t=4, span [-35 +6*4, -24+6*4] = [-35+24, -24+24] = [-11,0], so at t=4, span [-11,0], so 0 is included, since <=0 and >= min.\n\n-11 <=0 <=0, yes 0 is in [-11,0].\n\nSimilarly at t=5, span [-35+30, -24+30] = [-5,6], 0 in [-5,6].\n\nBut for row 1.\n\nSimilarly, car A and C not relevant for t>=0 except past.\n\nSo for row 1, collision at t=4 and t=5.\n\nt=4 and t=5.\n\nNow row 2 and row 3 are same as row 1, since cars identical.\n\nRow 2: same cars as row 1, so collision at t=4,5\n\nRow 3: same, t=4,5\n\nNow row 4: cars (30,19,right,6) and (-36,-47,right,6)\n\nFirst car: h=30, τ=19, s=6\n\n- h/s = -30/6 = -5\n\n- τ/s = -19/6 ≈ -3.166\n\nt >= ceil(-5) = -5\n\nt <= floor(-3.166) = -4? floor(-3.166) = -4\n\n-4 < -3.166 < -3, floor is -4\n\nt from -5 to -4, past.\n\nSecond car: h=-36, τ=-47, s=6\n\n- h/s = -(-36)/6 = 36/6 =6\n\n- τ/s = -(-47)/6 =47/6 ≈7.833\n\nt >= ceil(6) =6\n\nt <= floor(7.833) =7\n\nSo t=6,7\n\nThus for row 4, collision at t=6,7 from second car.\n\nFirst car not relevant for t>=0.\n\nSimilarly, row 5,6,7 same as row 4? Row 4 has two cars, row 5,6,7 same, so collision at t=6,7.\n\nRow 4: cars: (30,19,right,6) and (-36,-47,right,6)\n\nSecond car causes collision at t=6,7.\n\nSimilarly row 5,6,7 identical, so all have collision at t=6,7.\n\nNow row 8: different, s=4\n\nCars: (-12,-23,right,4), (-48,-59,right,4), (28,17,right,4)\n\nFirst car: h=-12, τ=-23, s=4\n\n- h/s = -(-12)/4 = 12/4 =3\n\n- τ/s = -(-23)/4 =23/4=5.75\n\nt >= ceil(3) =3\n\nt <= floor(5.75) =5\n\nSo t=3,4,5\n\nSecond car: h=-48, τ=-59, s=4\n\n- h/s = -(-48)/4 =48/4=12\n\n- τ/s = -(-59)/4 =59/4=14.75\n\nt >= ceil(12)=12\n\nt <= floor(14.75)=14\n\nSo t=12 to 14\n\nThird car: h=28, τ=17, s=4\n\n- h/s = -28/4 = -7\n\n- τ/s = -17/4 = -4.25\n\nt >= ceil(-7)= -7\n\nt <= floor(-4.25)= -5? floor(-4.25)= -5? -5 < -4.25 < -4, so floor -5\n\nt from -7 to -5, past.\n\nSo for row 8, collision at t=3,4,5 from first car, and t=12,13,14 from second car, but t=12,13,14 relative to t₁=0, which is now, t=13 is current? t relative, t=0 is current turn.\n\nt=0 is now, so for row 8, at t=3,4,5 collision from first car.\n\nt=3,4,5 are future turns.\n\nAnd t=12,13,14 also, but t=13 is current? t=0 is current, so t=13 is future.\n\nNow, summarize for each row, times when collision occurs (player cannot be on that row at that time):\n\nRow 1: collision at t=4,5\n\nRow 2: t=4,5\n\nRow 3: t=4,5\n\nRow 4: t=6,7\n\nRow 5: t=6,7\n\nRow 6: t=6,7\n\nRow 7: t=6,7\n\nRow 8: collision at t=3,4,5 (from first car) and also at t=12,13,14 (from second car)\n\nBut for our purpose, since we want to go to y=9, and we start at y=6, we need to move through rows 6,7,8 to reach 9.\n\ny=6,7,8 are the rows to move to 9.\n\nBut y=9 is not a freeway, freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nPlayer starts at (0,6), which is on row 6 at time t=0.\n\nNow, we need to check if at t=0, row 6 is occupied? For row 6, from above, collision at t=6,7, but t=0 is not 6 or 7, so should be safe now.\n\nSimilarly, for row 6, cars: same as row 4, row 6 has cars (30,19,right,6) and (-36,-47,right,6)\n\nAt t=0, span first car: [19,30], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: [-47,-36], 0 not in. So safe.\n\nNow, player is at y=6 at t=0.\n\nGoal: reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\ny=9 is the top, so we need to move up.\n\nPossible actions: U, D, S.\n\nSince we need to go up, D might not be useful, but could be to avoid collision.\n\nMinimal turns: from y=6 to y=9, minimum 3 turns if we go up each time: U,U,U.\n\nBut we need to avoid being on a row when there is collision.\n\nNow, let's list the forbidden (row, time) pairs.\n\nTime t relative to current, t=0 now.\n\nFor row 1: forbidden at t=4,5\n\nRow 2: t=4,5\n\nRow 3: t=4,5\n\nRow 4: t=6,7\n\nRow 5: t=6,7\n\nRow 6: t=6,7\n\nRow 7: t=6,7\n\nRow 8: forbidden at t=3,4,5 (and also t=12-14, but those are later, probably not relevant for minimal path)\n\nt=12-14 is far, since we want to reach in few turns.\n\nSimilarly, row 8 also forbidden at t=3,4,5.\n\nNow, we start at t=0, y=6.\n\ny=6 is safe at t=0, as above.\n\nWe need to be at y=9 at some T, and minimize T.\n\ny=9 is not a freeway, so no collision possible, we just need to arrive at y=9 at some turn.\n\nAt turn T, if y_T =9, we are done.\n\nNow, actions: each turn, we choose U, D, or S, changing y.\n\nTo go from 6 to 9, we need to increase y by 3, so at least 3 actions of U, but we might need to stay or move down to avoid being on a row at bad time.\n\nSince we start at t=0, y=6.\n\nIf we go up immediately: at t=0, action U, then y_1 = y_0 +1 =7 (at t=1)\n\nNotation: at turn t, we are at y_t, then after action, at turn t+1, y_{t+1}.\n\nAt turn t, we perform action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nSpecifically: at turn t, we are at position (0, y_t)\n\nWe choose action a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, with Δy based on a_t.\n\nAnd at turn t, we are on row y_t, so we check collision for row y_t at time t.\n\nThen at turn t+1, we are on row y_{t+1}, check at time t+1, etc.\n\nSo for turn t, collision if row y_t is occupied at time t.\n\nIn this case, at t=0, y_0=6, row 6 is safe at t=0, as above.\n\nNow, we want to reach y_T =9 for some T.\n\nSince y=9 is safe, T is the turn when we first reach y=9.\n\nMinimal T.\n\nThe minimal possible T is when we go up every turn: a0=U, y1=7; a1=U, y2=8; a2=U, y3=9. So at t=3, y=9.\n\nBut we need to check if we can be on the rows at those times without collision.\n\nt=0: y=6, safe.\n\nt=1: y=7, row 7.\n\nRow 7 is forbidden at t=6,7, but t=1 is not 6 or 7, so should be safe? Check.\n\nRow 7 has same as row 4, cars: at time t, for row 7.\n\nGeneral: for row 7, collision at t=6,7.\n\nAt t=1, is there collision? Cars on row 7: (30,19,right,6) and (-36,-47,right,6)\n\nAt t=1, span first car: [19 +6*1, 30+6*1] = [25,36], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: [-47+6, -36+6] = [-41,-30], 0 not in. So safe.\n\nSimilarly, t=2: y=8, row 8.\n\nRow 8 at t=2.\n\nRow 8 forbidden at t=3,4,5, etc.\n\nAt t=2, is it safe?\n\nRow 8 cars: first car (-12,-23,right,4), at t=2, span [τ + s*t, h + s*t] = [-23 +4*2, -12 +4*2] = [-23+8, -12+8] = [-15,-4], 0 not in? -15 <=0<= -4? 0 <= -4? No, 0 > -4, so 0 not in [-15,-4].\n\nSecond car (-48,-59,right,4), at t=2, [-59+8, -48+8] = [-51,-40], 0 not in.\n\nThird car (28,17,right,4), at t=2, [17+8, 28+8] = [25,36], 0 not in.\n\nSo row 8 safe at t=2.\n\nThen t=3: if we go to y=9, but at t=3, y should be 8 or something.\n\nIn the sequence: at turn t=2, if y2=8, and we do a2=U, then y3=9 at turn t=3.\n\nBut at turn t=2, we are on row 8 at time t=2, which is safe, as above.\n\nThen after action U, at turn t=3, we are at y3=9, which is safe.\n\nSo in three turns: actions U,U,U at t=0,1,2, reaching y=9 at t=3.\n\nBut we need to confirm row 8 at t=2 is safe, which we did.\n\nBut row 8 has collision at t=3,4,5, but at t=2 it is fine.\n\nIn this case, at t=3, we are at y=9, not on row 8.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nBut let's check if there is any issue with row 7 at t=1, which we said safe.\n\nt=1, y=7, row 7, safe.\n\nSeems fine.\n\nBut row 8 is forbidden at t=3, but we are not on row 8 at t=3 if we leave by then.\n\nIn this sequence, we are on row 8 only at t=2.\n\nt=2 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, for row 6 at t=0, safe.\n\nBut we need to output the actions starting from t₁=13.\n\nBut in relative terms, actions at t=0,1,2: U,U,U.\n\nThen H=3 turns, from t=0 to t=2, y at t=3 is 9? Let's clarify the timing.\n\nSet t=0: current turn, position y=6.\n\nAfter action a0, at turn t=1, position y1.\n\nAt turn t, we perform action a_t, and at that turn, we are on row y_t.\n\nFor turn t=0: we are on y0=6, perform a0, then y1 = y0 + Δy0\n\nAt turn t=1, we are on y1, perform a1, and so on.\n\nWe reach y=9 when for some T, at turn T, y_T=9.\n\nIn the sequence above, if we do a0=U, then y1=7\n\na1=U, y2=8\n\na2=U, y3=9\n\nSo at turn t=3, y3=9, we are done.\n\nAnd at each turn:\n\nTurn t=0: on row y0=6, time t=0, safe.\n\nTurn t=1: on row y1=7, time t=1, row 7 at t=1, as above, safe.\n\nTurn t=2: on row y2=8, time t=2, row 8 at t=2, safe.\n\nThen turn t=3: on row y3=9, no car, safe.\n\nSo it seems possible in 3 turns.\n\nBut is row 8 safe at t=2? Earlier calculation: for row 8, first car at t=2: span [-15,-4], 0 not in.\n\nOthers no.\n\nBut let's double-check row 8 at t=2.\n\nCars on row 8:\n\nFirst car: at t=0, head h=-12, tail τ=-23, s=4, right-moving.\n\nAt time t, span: [τ + s*t, h + s*t] = [-23 + 4t, -12 + 4t]\n\nAt t=2: [-23+8, -12+8] = [-15, -4], min=-15, max=-4, 0 not in [-15,-4], since -4 < 0.\n\nSecond car: h=-48, τ=-59, s=4, at t=2: [-59+8, -48+8] = [-51,-40], 0 not in.\n\nThird car: h=28, τ=17, s=4, at t=2: [17+8,28+8]=[25,36], 0 not in.\n\nYes.\n\nSimilarly, for row 7 at t=1: cars (30,19,right,6) and (-36,-47,right,6)\n\nAt t=1: first car [19+6,30+6]=[25,36], no 0\n\nSecond car [-47+6,-36+6]=[-41,-30], no 0.\n\nGood.\n\nBut row 8 has collision at t=3,4,5.\n\nAt t=3: for first car, span [-23+12, -12+12]? t=3, s=4, [ -23+4*3, -12+4*3] = [-23+12, -12+12] = [-11, 0]\n\n-11 <= 0 <= 0, yes, 0 is included, so collision if on row 8 at t=3.\n\nSimilarly at t=4: [-23+16, -12+16] = [-7,4], 0 in.\n\nt=5: [-23+20, -12+20] = [-3,8], 0 in.\n\nBut in our sequence, we are not on row 8 at t=3, we are at y=9.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nBut is there a reason we cannot go directly? The player is at y=6, and we can go up to 7,8,9 in three steps.\n\nBut let's see the car on row 8 at t=3, but we don't care.\n\nPerhaps for row 6 or 7, but at the times we are there, no collision.\n\nBut row 6 has collision at t=6,7, which is later.\n\nt=6 is turn 6, but we are done by t=3.\n\nSo should be fine.\n\nBut let's confirm if at any point we might be forced to stay or something.\n\nPerhaps I should list the safe times for each row we need.\n\nWe start at y=6, t=0.\n\nWe need to go to y=7, then y=8, then y=9.\n\nNow, y=7: row 7, when is it safe? Forbidden at t=6,7, so safe for t not 6 or 7, especially t=0,1,2,3,4,5,8,... etc.\n\nSimilarly, y=6: row 6, forbidden at t=6,7, safe otherwise.\n\ny=8: row 8, forbidden at t=3,4,5 and t=12,13,14.\n\nSo for t=0,1,2,6,7,8,9,10,11,15,... safe.\n\nIn our path, we are on y=6 at t=0, safe.\n\ny=7 at t=1, safe.\n\ny=8 at t=2, safe (since t=2 not forbidden).\n\nThen to y=9 at t=3.\n\nSeems minimal.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), and we do at turn t=3.\n\nBut turn count: from t=0 to t=2 actions, H=3 actions? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence: actions for turn t₁ + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nHere t₁=13.\n\nAt turn t₁: action a_{t₁}\n\nIn this case, at turn t=13 (which is t₁), player is at y=6, we do action U, then at turn t=14, y=7.\n\nThen at turn t=14, action U, to y=8 at t=15.\n\nAt turn t=15, action U, to y=9 at t=16.\n\nSo after 3 actions, at turn t=16, y=9.\n\nH=3 turns.\n\nBut is there a faster way? From y=6 to y=9, minimum 3 steps, since each step changes y by at most 1.\n\nSo 3 is minimum possible.\n\nBut we need to output the actions.\n\nBut in the car state, for row 8, there is a car at t=3,4,5, but in relative t=3, which is turn t₁+3=16.\n\nBut we are not on row 8 then.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if we can go faster, but no.\n\nAnother thing: the player can stay or go down, but that would take more turns, so not minimal.\n\nSo U,U,U should work.\n\nBut let's see the car on row 4 to 7, collision at t=6,7, but t=6 relative is turn 13+6=19, which is later.\n\nSimilarly, row 8 at t=12,13,14: t=13 is current turn, t=13 relative to t₁=0? t₁ is current, t=0.\n\nt relative: t=0 is turn t₁=13.\n\nt=13 relative is turn t₁+13=26, far away.\n\nBut at current turn t=0, which is turn 13, row 8 at time t=0: is it occupied?\n\nEarlier for row 8 at t=0: first car span [-23, -12], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car [-59,-48], no.\n\nThird car [17,28], no.\n\nSo safe, but we are not on it now.\n\nIn the sequence, we go to row 8 at t=2, which is turn 15, and it is safe.\n\nBut let's confirm row 8 at t=2, turn t₁+2=15.\n\nTime t=2 relative, which is absolute turn 13+2=15.\n\nCars on row 8 at time 15? The car positions depend on the time from t₁.\n\nSince we defined t relative to t₁=13.\n\nAt absolute turn T, for a car, span based on (T - t₁).\n\nIn our case, t relative.\n\nAt relative time t=2, which is absolute turn t₁ + t =13 +2=15.\n\nFor row 8, cars: at relative time t, span as computed.\n\nFirst car: [ -23 + 4t, -12 + 4t ]\n\nAt t=2: [-23+8, -12+8] = [-15,-4], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo should be fine.\n\nBut in the output, we need to list the actions starting from turn t₁.\n\nSo for turn t₁=13: action U\n\nTurn t₁+1=14: action U\n\nTurn t₁+2=15: action U\n\nThen at turn t₁+3=16, position y=9.\n\nH=3.\n\nBut the sequence is actions from t=0 to H-1, so H actions? In the answer format, {a_{t₁ + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}, so for t=0 to H-1, H actions.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t₁ + H, y should be 9? Let's see.\n\nAt turn t₁, before action, position is given.\n\nAfter action a_{t₁}, at turn t₁+1, position y_{t₁+1} = y_{t₁} + Δy\n\nSimilarly, after a_{t₁+1}, at turn t₁+2, y_{t₁+2}, and so on.\n\nWe reach (0,9) when for some turn T, position is (0,9).\n\nIn the sequence, after H actions, we have performed actions at turns t₁ to t₁+H-1, and at turn t₁+H, position is (0,9).\n\nFor example, here, after 3 actions: at turn t₁+3, position is (0,9).\n\nSo H=3.\n\nActions: a_{t₁}, a_{t₁+1}, a_{t₁+2} all U.\n\nBut in the output, it should be:\n\nTurn t_1: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 2: U\n\nBut let's make sure there is no collision at the times.\n\nAt turn t₁=13: position y=6, row 6 at time t=13 absolute? Since collision depends on absolute time or relative?\n\nThe car update is based on T - t₁, with t₁=13.\n\nIn the span: for a car, at time T, span is based on (T - t₁).\n\nIn the rule: at turn T > t₁, span is [h - s(T-t₁) for left, but here right, [τ + s(T-t₁), h + s(T-t₁)]\n\nT is absolute turn number.\n\nt₁=13.\n\nSo for row 6, at time T, when is collision.\n\nBut in our earlier, we used relative t, with t=T - t₁.\n\nSo for row 6, cars same as row 4, collision when relative t=6 or 7.\n\nAbsolute: at absolute turn T, collision if T - t₁ =6 or 7, so T=19 or 20.\n\nSimilarly, for row 7, same.\n\nRow 8, collision at relative t=3,4,5 or t=12,13,14.\n\nAbsolute: t=3: T=16, t=4:T=17, t=5:T=18; t=12:T=25, t=13:T=26, t=14:T=27.\n\nNow at current turn t₁=13, T=13, relative t=0.\n\nAt turn T=13: we are on row 6, which is safe, as relative t=0 not 6 or 7.\n\nThen action U, so at turn T=14, we are on row 7? At turn T=14, position y=7, so row 7 at time T=14.\n\nRelative t = T - t₁ =14-13=1.\n\nFor row 7, collision at relative t=6,7, so T=19,20.\n\nt=1 not 6 or 7, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, at turn T=14, we perform action U, so at turn T=15, position y=8.\n\nAt turn T=15, we are on row 8, time T=15.\n\nRelative t=15-13=2.\n\nFor row 8, collision at t=3,4,5,12,13,14.\n\nt=2 not in {3,4,5,12,13,14}, so safe.\n\nThen at turn T=15, action U, so at turn T=16, position y=9.\n\nAt T=16, y=9, no car, safe.\n\nAnd we reached.\n\nAt T=16, relative t=3, but row 8 has collision at t=3, which is T=16, but we are on y=9, not row 8.\n\nSo all good.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=3 with actions U,U,U.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\", but in this case, it seems straightforward.\n\nBut let me see if row 8 at t=2 is safe, relative t=2.\n\nFor row 8, first car: at relative t=2, span [-23 +4*2, -12 +4*2] = [-23+8, -12+8] = [-15,-4], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: [-59 +4*2, -48 +4*2] = [-59+8, -48+8] = [-51,-40], 0 not in.\n\nThird: [17+8,28+8]=[25,36], no.\n\nYes.\n\nPerhaps for y=8, we need to avoid t=3, but we are not there.\n\nAnother thing: the player might go down to avoid, but that would take more turns, so not minimal.\n\nFor example, if we stay at y=6 for one turn, then go up, but that would take 4 turns.\n\nSimilarly, going down to y=5 and up, more.\n\nSo U,U,U is best.\n\nBut let's see if at some point we must avoid.\n\nPerhaps row 7 or something.\n\nAt t=1 relative, row 7, safe.\n\nBut row 7 has collision at t=6,7, but not now.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nPerhaps I misread the car state.\n\nAnother row: row 1 to 3 have collision at t=4,5 relative, which is T=17,18.\n\nBut we are not on those rows.\n\nIn this path, we only go through rows 6,7,8 at times t=0,1,2 relative, all safe.\n\nSo should be ok.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is:\n\nTurn t_1: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 2: U\n\nWith H=3.\n\nBut in the answer format.\n\nBut let's write it properly.\n\nt_1 is given as 13.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nAnd after that, at turn 16, y=9.\n\nBut the sequence ends with the last action.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut the problem says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\", so for t=0 to H-1, H actions.\n\nHere H=3, t from 0 to 2.\n\na_{13}, a_{14}, a_{15} all U.\n\nThen at turn 16, position (0,9).\n\nNow, to be thorough, let's check if row 8 is safe at other times, but not necessary.\n\nPerhaps for row 8, at t=13 absolute, which is relative t=0, but we are not on it.\n\nBut I think it's fine.\n\nSo the minimal H is 3.\n\nBut the answer should be in the box.\n\nBut let's see if we can do it in less, impossible.\n\nPerhaps with S, but no, S keeps y same, so to increase y, we need U.\n\nUnless we start from higher, but we start at 6, need to 9, so at least 3 U.\n\nSo yes.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is three Ups.\n\nBut in the output, it should be written as:\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 13: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 14: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 15: U }\n\nIn the format: \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc.\n\nIn the problem, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" so use t_1.\n\nBut since t_1 is 13, we can write the numbers.\n\nIn the box, probably with the numbers.\n\nSince t_1 is given.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nBut let me confirm the car on row 8 at t=3 relative.\n\nAt t=3, relative, row 8 first car span [-23 +4*3, -12+12] = [-23+12, -12+12] = [-11,0], which includes 0, so if on row 8 at absolute turn 16, collision.\n\nBut in our case, at turn 16, we are at y=9, not row 8.\n\nAt turn 15, we were on row 8, but at time turn 15, relative t=2, safe.\n\nThen after action U at turn 15, at turn 16 we are at y=9.\n\nSo no collision.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n</think>\nThe goal is to reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 6) at turn \\(t_1 = 13\\) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\), avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis\n- The player starts at \\(y = 6\\) at turn \\(t = 13\\).\n- To reach \\(y = 9\\), the player must increase their \\(y\\)-coordinate by 3, requiring at least 3 turns if moving up (U) each turn.\n- The car configurations and movements are analyzed to ensure no collision occurs during the path.\n\n#### Car Collision Times (relative to \\(t_1 = 13\\))\n- **Row 1, 2, 3**: Collision at relative times \\(t = 4, 5\\) (absolute turns 17, 18).\n- **Row 4, 5, 6, 7**: Collision at relative times \\(t = 6, 7\\) (absolute turns 19, 20).\n- **Row 8**: Collision at relative times \\(t = 3, 4, 5\\) (absolute turns 16, 17, 18) and \\(t = 12, 13, 14\\) (absolute turns 25, 26, 27).\n\n#### Path to \\(y = 9\\)\n- At turn \\(t = 13\\) (relative \\(t = 0\\): Player is at \\(y = 6\\). Row 6 is safe at this time (no collision).\n- Action: Move up (U) to \\(y = 7\\) for turn \\(t = 14\\).\n- At turn \\(t = 14\\) (relative \\(t = 1\\): Player is at \\(y = 7\\). Row 7 is safe at this time (collision only at \\(t = 6, 7\\) relative, not \\(t = 1\\)).\n- Action: Move up (U) to \\(y = 8\\) for turn \\(t = 15\\).\n- At turn \\(t = 15\\) (relative \\(t = 2\\)): Player is at \\(y = 8\\). Row 8 is safe at this time (collision at \\(t = 3, 4, 5, 12, 13, 14\\) relative, not \\(t = 2\\)).\n- Action: Move up (U) to \\(y = 9\\) for turn \\(t = 16\\).\n\nAt turn \\(t = 16\\), the player reaches \\(y = 9\\), which is not a freeway and thus safe. This path takes exactly 3 turns (\\(H = 3\\)) and avoids all collisions.\n\n#### Why Minimal?\n- Moving up each turn is the fastest way to increase \\(y\\) from 6 to 9.\n- Staying (S) or moving down (D) would increase \\(H\\) beyond 3, so it is not minimal.\n- No alternative path with \\(H < 3\\) exists, as each action changes \\(y\\) by at most 1.\n\n### Sequence of Actions\n- Actions are for turns \\(t_1\\) to \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 13\\) to \\(15\\).\n- Sequence: \\(a_{13} = U\\), \\(a_{14} = U\\), \\(a_{15} = U\\).\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 13: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 14: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 15: U }",

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at position (0, 8) at turn t_1 = 15. The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. Since the player is at y=8, and needs to get to y=9, which is above, I need to move up. But y=9 is the top, and it's not a freeway, so no cars there. The freeways are from y=1 to y=8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe; no cars there.\n\nThe player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with actions U (+1), D (-1), S (0). And y must stay between 0 and 9 inclusive.\n\nCollision occurs only if at turn T, the player is on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there is a car such that 0 is in its span at that turn. The note says that if you move to a different y at turn T, you are not on that new y until the next turn. So at turn T, you are on y_T, and you take action a_T, which determines y_{T+1}. But for collision, it's based on where you are at turn T, so at turn T, you are on y_T, and you check if 0 is in the span of any car on freeway y_T at turn T.\n\nThe car update: for each car, at turn t_1, we have the span [head, tail] and direction and speed. Then at turn T > t_1, the span is shifted based on speed and direction.\n\nFor left-moving cars, head decreases, for right-moving, head increases. But in the description, it says:\n\n- Left-moving: Span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]? That seems inconsistent. Let me read carefully.\n\nIt says: for left-moving, Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nBut h and τ, which is head and tail? Typically, head is the front, but for left-moving, if it's moving left, head should decrease.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving: Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nThis notation is a bit messy. I think for consistency, we should think in terms of the position at time.\n\nBut let's interpret the spans given.\n\nFirst, all cars are moving right, I think, based on the data. Direction is \"right\" for all.\n\nSo for right-moving cars, at turn t_1, Span(t_1) = [τ, h], with τ < h, I assume.\n\nIn the table, for example, freeway 1: (24,13,right,6), so head=24, tail=13? But 24>13, so if moving right, head should be larger, tail smaller? The span is [head, tail] but head=24, tail=13, which is decreasing, but direction is right, so it should be increasing.\n\nI think there's confusion in the notation.\n\nLook: for right-moving, it says Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT]\n\nAnd τ and h, with τ probably tail, h head.\n\nIn the data, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed), but for right-moving, head should be greater than tail if it's moving right.\n\nFor freeway 1, cars: (24,13,right,6), so head=24, tail=13, since 24>13, and moving right, so the car is from x=13 to x=24, and moving right, so at later time, both increase.\n\nSimilarly, (-12,-23,right,6): head=-12, tail=-23, -12 > -23, so from x=-23 to x=-12, moving right.\n\n(-48,-59,right,6): similar.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nAnd for freeway 8, (-4,-15,right,4), etc.\n\nAll cars are moving right.\n\nNow, the player is at (0,8), so on freeway y=8 at turn t_1=15.\n\nBut we need to move to (0,9), which is not a freeway, so no cars, safe.\n\nBut to reach there, we need to be at y=9 at some turn.\n\nSince we start at y=8, we can go up to y=9 with U action, but we need to avoid collisions at each turn we are on a freeway.\n\nThe collision is only when we are on the freeway at that turn, and 0 is in the car's span for that freeway at that turn.\n\nNow, since we are at y=8 at turn 15, we need to check if at turn 15, on freeway 8, is there a car where 0 is in its span.\n\nFreeway 8 cars at t_1=15: (-4,-15,right,4), (-40,-51,right,4), (36,25,right,4)\n\nNow, span for each: first car: head=-4, tail=-15, so span [-15,-4] since right-moving, but in the notation, for right-moving, Span = [τ, h] with τ tail, h head.\n\nAt turn T, for right-moving car, Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nSimilarly for left, but all are right here.\n\nSo at turn t_1=15, s=4, but T=t_1, so ΔT=0, so Span(15) = [τ, h] for each car.\n\nFor freeway 8:\n\nCar1: τ = -15? The data is given as (head, tail), so for (head, tail, dir, speed), and dir=right.\n\nIn the car state, it's listed as (head, tail, direction, speed), but for right-moving, head should be the right end.\n\nIn the span definition, for right-moving, it says Span(t_1) = [τ, h] where τ is tail, h is head? But in the data, it's (head, tail), so head is h, tail is τ.\n\nFor the first car: head = -4, tail = -15? But if tail is τ, and it's the left end, then for right-moving, Span(t_1) = [τ, h] = [-15, -4]\n\nSimilarly, second car: head=-40? No, head=-40, tail=-51? That can't be, because -40 > -51, so tail should be -51, head -40.\n\nList:\n\nCar1: head = -4, tail = -15? But tail should be less than head for right-moving.\n\nhead=-4, tail=-15, so since -4 > -15, tail is -15, head is -4, so span at t_1 is [ -15, -4 ]\n\nSimilarly, car2: head=-40, tail=-51, so span [ -51, -40 ]\n\nCar3: head=36, tail=25, so span [25,36]\n\nAll moving right with speed 4.\n\nNow, at turn T, for a car, Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)] for right-moving.\n\nWith s speed, t_1=15.\n\nNow, we are at turn t_1=15, position y=8.\n\nWe need to check if at turn 15, on freeway 8, is 0 in any car's span.\n\nFor car1: span [ -15, -4 ] at T=15, is 0 in [ -15, -4 ]? -15 to -4, 0 is not in this interval since -4 < 0? -4 is less than 0, so [ -15, -4 ] is from -15 to -4, all negative, 0 > -4, so 0 not in [ -15, -4 ].\n\nSimilarly, car2: [ -51, -40 ], all negative, 0 not in.\n\nCar3: [25,36], all positive, 0 not in.\n\nSo at turn 15, on freeway 8, no collision, since 0 not in any span.\n\nNow, the player can take action at turn 15 to move.\n\nPossible actions: U, D, S.\n\nIf U, then y_{16} = 8 + 1 = 9, which is the goal, but we reach (0,9) at turn 16.\n\nBut we need to be at (0,9) at some turn, and since we take action at turn t, it affects position at turn t+1.\n\nAt turn t, we are at y_t, take action a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nWe start at turn t_1=15, y_15=8.\n\nAfter H turns, meaning after H actions, we are at turn t_1 + H, position y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nThe sequence is from t=0 to H-1, so actions a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1}, and after that, at turn t_1 + H, we are at y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nWe want y_{t_1 + H} = 9.\n\nSince we start at y_15=8, if we take U at turn 15, then y_16 = 8 + 1 = 9, so at turn 16, we are at (0,9), which is the goal. H=1 action, so sequence: a_15 = U.\n\nBut is this safe? We need to avoid collisions during the process.\n\nAt turn 15, we are on y=8, and we saw no collision at turn 15.\n\nWhen we take action U at turn 15, we move to y=9 at turn 16, and since y=9 has no cars, no collision.\n\nBut during the move, at turn 15, we were on y=8, safe, and at turn 16, on y=9, safe.\n\nSo it seems we can reach in one step.\n\nBut let me confirm the collision rule.\n\nThe note says: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 in span at T but not at T+1.\"\n\nBut in this case, at turn T=15, we are on y=8, and we move to y=9 at T+1=16.\n\nAt turn 15, we are on y=8, so we check cars on y=8 at turn 15, which we did, no collision.\n\nAt turn 16, we are on y=9, no cars, so no issue.\n\nSo H=1, action U at turn 15.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), and we can do it immediately.\n\nBut let's see why this might not be possible. Perhaps for other freeways, but since we are only on y=8 at turn 15, and then y=9, no other freeways involved.\n\nMaybe the cars on y=8 at other times, but we are only there at turn 15.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider if at turn 15, on y=8, it is safe, which it is.\n\nBut let me double-check the car positions at turn 15.\n\nFreeway 8 cars:\n\nCar1: span [ -15, -4 ] at T=15, 0 not in.\n\nCar2: [ -51, -40 ], 0 not in.\n\nCar3: [25,36], 0 not in.\n\nAll good.\n\nBut the player is at (0,8), which is x=0, y=8.\n\nAnd collision if at turn T, on freeway i, and 0 in car's span for that freeway at that turn.\n\nYes.\n\nSo with one action U at turn 15, we go to y=9 at turn 16.\n\nH=1.\n\nBut the answer should be minimal H, which is 1.\n\nBut let me see if there is any reason we cannot go up immediately.\n\nPerhaps for y=8, but at turn 15 it's safe.\n\nMaybe we need to consider the sequence, but it seems straightforward.\n\nBut let's look at the other freeways; perhaps the player needs to move through other rows, but no, since we are already at y=8, and can go directly to y=9.\n\ny=8 is a freeway, y=9 is not, so we can go up.\n\nBut in the car update, for future turns, but since we only stay at turn 15 on y=8, and move immediately, no issue.\n\nPerhaps the minimal H is 1.\n\nBut let me see the car state for other freeways; maybe it's a trick.\n\nFor example, freeway 4 to 7 have cars, but since we don't go there, no problem.\n\nFreeway 1,2,3 have similar cars, but y=8 is different.\n\nIn freeway 8, the cars are moving, but at turn 15, as above.\n\nPerhaps at turn 15, for freeway 8, car1: [ -15, -4], which is from x=-15 to x=-4, so x=0 is to the right of -4, not in the span.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nSo I think it's safe.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), and we can do it in one move.\n\nBut let me read the task again.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nWith H=1, sequence: a_{15} = U.\n\nAnswer format: Turn t_1: a_{t_1}, so Turn 15: U\n\nBut since H=1, only one action.\n\nBut I feel like this might be too simple, and perhaps I missed something.\n\nAnother thing: the player position is (0, y_{t_1}) = (0,8), and we need to reach (0,9), so vertical move only.\n\nBut with U, we can go directly.\n\nBut let's see if at turn 16, when we arrive at y=9, but y=9 has no cars, so ok.\n\nPerhaps the collision is only when on freeway, so y=0 and y=9 are safe.\n\nSo I think H=1 is possible.\n\nBut let me check if for y=8, at turn 15, it is indeed safe, which it is.\n\nPerhaps the cars are moving, but at the specific turn, we check.\n\nAnother point: the car update, for turn T, we have Span(T) based on t_1.\n\nAt turn 15, ΔT=0, so as above.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider that if we stay, but we don't need to.\n\nMaybe for other starting positions, but here it's fine.\n\nBut let's look at the car state for freeway 8; there is a car with head -4, tail -15, so at x=-15 to -4, and speed 4, moving right.\n\nAt turn 15, x=0 is not covered.\n\nIf we stayed, at later turns it might cover, but we are not staying.\n\nSimilarly, other cars.\n\nSo I think it's ok.\n\nPerhaps the player can go down, but that would take more turns, not minimal.\n\nSo minimal H is 1 with U.\n\nBut let me see the answer format; it should be a sequence.\n\nFor H=1, it should be one action.\n\nBut in the sequence, t from 0 to H-1, so for H=1, t=0, a_{t_1 + 0} = a_15.\n\nThen y_{t_1 + H} = y_16 =9.\n\nYes.\n\nPerhaps the turn numbering: at turn t_1, we are at position, we take action, move to next turn.\n\nSo with one action, we reach at turn 16.\n\nI think it's correct.\n\nBut why are there other freeways with cars? For example, if we were at lower y, we might need to navigate, but here we are at y=8 already.\n\nPlayer starts at (0,8), and needs to go to (0,9), so only one move up.\n\nUnless at turn 15, on y=8, it is not safe, but we checked it is.\n\nPerhaps I misread the car spans.\n\nFor freeway 8, cars: ( -4, -15, right, 4) , so tail= -15, head= -4, so span [ -15, -4] at t_1=15.\n\n0 is not in [ -15, -4] because -4 < 0, so 0 > -4, not included.\n\nSimilarly, ( -40, -51, right,4) , tail= -51, head= -40, span [ -51, -40], 0 not in.\n\n(36,25,right,4), but head=36, tail=25, so for right-moving, span should be [tail, head] = [25,36], since moving right, tail is left end.\n\nIn the notation, for right-moving, Span(t_1) = [τ, h] with τ tail, h head.\n\nSo here τ=25, h=36, so [25,36], 0 not in.\n\nSo all good.\n\nPerhaps the direction or something, but all right, so moving right.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nBut let me calculate the span at turn 15 for completeness.\n\nt_1=15, T=15, ΔT=0, so Span(15) = [τ, h] for each.\n\nCar1: τ = -15 (tail), h = -4 (head), so [ -15, -4]\n\nCar2: τ = -51, h = -40, [ -51, -40]\n\nCar3: τ = 25? The data is (head=36, tail=25), so tail=25, head=36, so [25,36]\n\nYes.\n\n0 not in any.\n\nSo no collision at turn 15 on y=8.\n\nThus, action U at turn 15, move to y=9 at turn 16.\n\nH=1.\n\nBut the problem says \"avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1,...,8\", and at turn 16, we are on y=9, not a freeway, so no issue.\n\nSo I think that's the answer.\n\nBut perhaps for other turns, if we had to stay, but we don't.\n\nMaybe the initial position is at turn t_1, and we need to act from there.\n\nI think I should consider if there is a car that will be at 0 at turn 15, but it's not.\n\nPerhaps the tail and head are inclusive, but 0 not in the intervals.\n\nSo I believe H=1 is possible.\n\nBut let me see the car state for other freeways, just in case.\n\nFor example, freeway 1: cars (24,13,right,6), so head=24, tail=13, span [13,24] at t_1=15.\n\nSimilarly, (-12,-23,right,6), head=-12, tail=-23, span [-23,-12]\n\n(-48,-59,right,6), span [-59,-48]\n\nAll far from 0.\n\nFreeway 2 and 3 same as 1? The table says for 1,2,3 all have the same cars: (24,13),(-12,-23),(-48,-59) all right speed 6.\n\nFreeway 4 to 7 have (42,31),(-24,-35) right speed 6.\n\nFor example, freeway 4: (42,31,right,6), span [31,42]? Tail=31, head=42, so [31,42]\n\n(-24,-35,right,6), tail=-35, head=-24, span [-35,-24]\n\nSimilarly for 5,6,7.\n\nFreeway 8 as before.\n\nAll cars are far from x=0 at turn 15.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, the player can move up immediately.\n\nSo minimal H is 1, action U at turn 15.\n\nAnswer should be:\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut the sequence is for t from 0 to H-1, so only one action.\n\nPerhaps I need to write it as per format.\n\nBut let me confirm if at turn 15, when we take U, we move to y=9 at turn 16, and we are at (0,9) at turn 16.\n\nYes.\n\nIf we take S or D, we stay or go down, which is worse, so U is best.\n\nSo I think that's it.\n\nBut the problem mentions \"multi-turn game\", and \"current turn is t_1\", and given initial position, so for this specific state, it should be fine.\n\nPerhaps for y=8, there is a car that will be at 0 soon, but at the exact turn, it's not.\n\nCollision only at the turn when we are on the freeway.\n\nSo I think correct.\n\nSo the answer should be:\n\n\\boxed{ Turn 15: U }\n\nBut in the format, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc.\n\nSince only one turn, it should be fine.\n\nPerhaps they expect the sequence, so for H=1, it's one line.\n\nI think it's ok.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 8) at turn \\(t_1 = 15\\). The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\), avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\nAt turn 15, the player is on freeway \\(y = 8\\). The cars on freeway 8 at turn 15 are:\n- Car 1: span \\([-15, -4]\\) (from tail \\(-15\\) to head \\(-4\\))\n- Car 2: span \\([-51, -40]\\) (from tail \\(-51\\) to head \\(-40\\))\n- Car 3: span \\([25, 36]\\) (from tail \\(25\\) to head \\(36\\))\n\nThe position \\(x = 0\\) is not in any of these spans, so there is no collision at turn 15.\n\nThe player can take action \\(U\\) (up) at turn 15, moving to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 16. Since \\(y = 9\\) is not a freeway (freeways are only \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\)), there are no cars, and thus no collision risk at turn 16.\n\nThis action sequence reaches the goal in one turn (\\(H = 1\\)). Any other action (\\(S\\) or \\(D\\)) would either keep the player at \\(y = 8\\) or move down, requiring additional turns and increasing \\(H\\), which is not minimal.\n\nThus, the minimal sequence is a single action: \\(U\\) at turn 15.\n\n\\boxed{ Turn 15: U }",
