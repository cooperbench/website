(4, 5) — value +1\n2. (3, 6) — value +1\n3. (2, 6) — value +1\n\nAll foods have a life span of 10, so they will disappear after turn 10.\n\n### Obstacles:\n- Internal obstacles include (3, 2), so moving Down is blocked.\n- Other obstacles are not directly blocking the immediate moves.\n\n### Possible Immediate Actions:\n1. **Move Left (L) to (2, 3)**:\n   - Next steps: From (2, 3), possible moves are U to (2, 4) — but (2, 4) is an obstacle, so blocked. \n   - Alternative: L to (1, 3), then U to (1, 4) — but (1, 4) is an obstacle. \n   - This path seems problematic for reaching food quickly.\n\n2. **Move Up (U) to (3, 4)**:\n   - Next steps: From (3, 4), can move U to (3, 5), then U to (3, 6) to eat the food at (3, 6).\n   - This is a direct path to the first food in 3 turns.\n\n### Evaluation:\n- Moving Up (U) to (3, 4) is the better immediate action because it leads directly to the food at (3, 6) in a few turns.\n- Moving Left (L) to (2, 3) does not provide a clear path to any food quickly and may lead to dead ends due to obstacles.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe best immediate action is to move **Up (U)** to (3, 4).\n\n\\boxed{U}",

All have life span 10, and since turn t1=0, they disappear after turn 10, meaning they last until turn 10 inclusive? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so if life span is N, it disappears after N turns, so it can be eaten on turns when countdown >0.\n> \n> For example, at turn t, life span l, it can be eaten if l >0, and after eating, it disappears.\n> \n> Here, all food has life span 10 at turn 0, so they can be eaten until turn 9? Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span).

The problem doesn't say anything about new food spawning. It only gives the current food positions. So I think only these three food items are present, no new ones until eaten or expired.\n> \n> The state input only gives current food, so I should assume no new food spawns; only these three exist until eaten or expired.\n> \n> To maximize score, I want to eat as many positive food as possible while avoiding risks.\n> \n> Since all food is positive here, value +1 each.\n> \n> Snake is length 1, so eating one food makes it length 2, and so on.\n> \n> But I need to avoid collisions and plan long-term.\n> \n> Also, tail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> But for now, snake length 1, no tail, so not an issue yet.\n> \n> First, let's find a path to eat one food.\n> \n> Easiest seems to be (3,6): go U to (3,4), then U to (3,5), then U to (3,6) to eat it.\n> \n> But when I eat at (3,6), on that turn, snake grows.\n> \n> Currently snake is at (3,3), one cell.\n> \n> After moving U to (3,4), snake position becomes [(3,4)] still length 1.\n> \n> Then U to (3,5), position [(3,5)]\n> \n> Then U to (3,6), now at (3,6), which is food, so eat it, snake grows to length 2: positions [(3,6), (3,5)]? When eating, the head moves to food, and a new segment is added at the previous tail position, but since tail was (3,5) before moving, but when moving to (3,6), head was at (3,5), moves to (3,6), so tail was... let's think carefully.\n> \n> Snake movement: when moving, head moves to new position, each segment moves to the next position, tail leaves its position.\n> \n> For a snake of length 1: positions [H]\n> \n> After moving to new cell, say new H, then positions [new H], and if ate food, it grows, so positions [new H, old H].\n> \n> Standard snake: when head moves to a cell, if it's food, snake grows, so the tail stays, and new head is added.\n> \n> But in terms of positions: before move, positions [P0] (head)\n> \n> Move to new cell Q.\n> \n> If no food, positions become [Q] (still length 1)\n> \n> If food at Q, positions become [Q, P0] (length 2)\n> \n> Similarly for longer snakes.\n> \n> In this case:\n> \n> Turn 0: start at (3,3)\n> \n> If I move U to (3,4), and (3,4) is not food, so snake becomes [(3,4)] length 1.\n> \n> Then turn 1: move U to (3,5), not food, snake [(3,5)]\n> \n> Turn 2: move U to (3,6), which is food, so eat it, snake becomes [(3,6), (3,5)] length 2, head at (3,6), tail at (3,5)\n> \n> Direction: after moving U multiple times, head direction U.\n> \n> Now, after that, I can eat other food.\n> \n> But there are other foods: (4,5) and (2,6)\n> \n> (2,6) is at (2,6), which is left of (3,6)\n> \n> (4,5) is at (4,5), which is down and right from (3,6)?

The grid goes from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7, but since borders are walls, the snake can only be on cells from (1,1) to (6,6). Let me confirm: walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so yes, the valid cells are x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n> \n> Now, internal obstacles: [(5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3), (5,1), (1,5), (3,2)]. So these cells are blocked and cannot be moved into.\n> \n> Snake positions: only [(3,5)]. That means the snake has only one segment? That can't be right for a snake game. Let me read: \"Snake Positions: [(3,5)]\". And it says \"head first\", but there's only one position. Maybe the snake is just the head? But in snake, the snake should have a body, but here it's given as a list with one element. Perhaps it's a new snake with length 1. That makes sense for the start.\n> \n> Snake head direction is U, meaning up.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (4,5) with life span 8, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (3,6) with life span 8, value 1\n> \n> - (2,6) with life span 8, value 1\n> \n> - (4,6) with life span 9, value 1\n> \n> All food has value 1, so all are positive.

Possible moves: U, D, L, R. But since direction is U, I can't do instant reverse to D. So I can go U, L, or R. Not D.\n> \n> Now, from (3,5):\n> \n> - U: to (3,6)\n> \n> - D: to (3,4) but D is reverse, so not allowed? Direction is U, so opposite is D. So I cannot move D this turn.\n> \n> - L: to (2,5)\n> \n> - R: to (4,5)\n> \n> Now, let's see what cells are safe.\n> \n> First, (3,6) has food, value 1. If I move U to (3,6), I eat the food there. Since snake is length 1, after eating, it becomes length 2. The head moves to (3,6), and the tail was at (3,5), but since it grows, the tail stays or what? Standard snake: when you eat, you grow, so after moving to food, the head is at food, and tail doesn't move, so new position: head at (3,6), and tail at (3,5), so snake becomes [(3,6), (3,5)].\n> \n> Similarly, if I move to (4,5), I eat the food there, snake becomes [(4,5), (3,5)].\n> \n> Now, risks: since snake is short, no body collision yet.\n> \n> Also, walls and obstacles.\n> \n> (3,6) is within bounds? x=3, y=6. y=6 is playable since y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=1 to 6, so y=6 is the top row, but not wall, it's playable. Similarly, x=3 is fine.\n> \n> Is (3,6) an obstacle? Obstacles are given, (3,6) not listed, so safe.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,5): x=4,y=5, not wall, not obstacle, safe.\n> \n> (2,5): x=2,y=5, should be safe, no obstacle there.\n> \n> (3,4): but I cannot move down, reverse not allowed.\n> \n> Now, also, food at (3,6) has life span 8, meaning it will disappear after 8 turns, including current? Life span decreases every turn, including current.\n> \n> Current turn t=2, food at (3,6) life span 8, so it will disappear at turn 2 + 8 - 1? Let's clarify life span.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So for food at turn t with life span L, it will disappear after L turns, meaning it is present for turns t to t+L-1? Or t to t+L?\n> \n> Example: if at turn t, life span L, then after one turn, at t+1, life span is L-1. When life span reaches 0, it disappears.\n> \n> So at turn t, life span L, it will disappear at turn t + L, because after L decreases, at turn t+L, life span is 0, so not present.\n> \n> Let's think: at turn t, life span L. After turn t, countdown decreases, so at start of turn t+1, life span is L-1. Similarly, at start of turn t+L, life span is 0, so food disappears before turn t+L or at?\n> \n> The state is given at the start of turn t, before action.\n> \n> After I move, the state updates.\n> \n> For life span: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So at current turn t, before action, food has life span L.\n> \n> After I take action and move, the turn ends, so countdown decreases by 1.\n> \n> So for food with life span L at turn t, after turn t, life span becomes L-1 for turn t+1.\n> \n> It disappears when life span reaches 0, so at the start of turn when life span is 0, food is gone.\n> \n> So for food at (3,6) with life span 8 at turn 2, it will be present until turn 2 + 8 - 1 = 9? Let's see:\n> \n> At turn 2: life span 8\n> \n> After turn 2: life span decreases to 7, and food still there for turn 3.\n> \n> At turn 3: life span 7\n> \n> After turn 3: decreases to 6, and so on.\n> \n> At turn 9: life span would be 8 - (9-2) = 8 - 7 = 1? Let's calculate decrease.\n> \n> From turn 2 to turn 3, life span decreases by 1, so from 8 to 7.\n> \n> At turn t, life span is L, then at turn t+1, life span is L-1.\n> \n> So at turn 2, life span 8\n> \n> Turn 3: 7\n> \n> ...\n> \n> Turn 9: 8 - (9-2) = 8 - 7 = 1? 9-2=7, so 8-7=1, so at turn 9, life span 1\n> \n> Then after turn 9, it decreases to 0 and disappears, so not available at turn 10.\n> \n> Similarly, it disappears at the end of turn when life span becomes 0, so for turn t, if life span L, it is available for L turns starting from t, so from t to t+L-1.\n> \n> At turn t, available with L.\n> \n> After turn t, L-1, available for turn t+1 if L-1 >0, etc.\n> \n> So at turn t, it can be eaten during turn t, and it will be present until the start of turn t+L, when life span becomes 0, it is removed.\n> \n> \"Disappears after N turns\" – after N turns from now.\n> \n> At turn t, with life span N, it disappears after N turns, meaning at turn t+N, it is gone.\n> \n> For example, at turn 2, life span 8, it will disappear after 8 turns, so at turn 10, it is not there.\n> \n> Turn 2: present\n> \n> Turn 3: present\n> \n> ...\n> \n> Turn 9: present (after 7 turns from turn 2)\n> \n> After 8 turns from turn 2 is turn 10, so at turn 10, it is disappeared.\n> \n> Similarly, for turn t, food with life span N is present from turn t to turn t+N-1.\n> \n> At turn t+N, it is gone.\n> \n> In this case, all food has life span at least 8, and current turn 2, so they last until turn 9 or 10, plenty of time, no urgency.\n> \n> Now, back to movement.\n> \n> Snake is at (3,5), direction U.\n> \n> I can move U, L, or R.\n> \n> If I move U to (3,6), I eat the food at (3,6), snake grows to [(3,6), (3,5)], length 2.\n> \n> Then head direction becomes U.\n> \n> If I move R to (4,5), eat food at (4,5), snake becomes [(4,5), (3,5)], head direction R.\n> \n> If I move L to (2,5), no food there, so snake moves to (2,5), but since no food, length remains 1, so snake is just [(2,5)], but after moving, the head is at new position, and since no grow, tail disappears, but here snake was length 1, so if no eat, snake moves to new cell, and since no tail, it might be just the head at new position.

The grid goes from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7, but since borders are walls, the snake can only be on cells from (1,1) to (6,6). Let me confirm: walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so yes, the valid cells are x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n> \n> Now, internal obstacles: [(5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3), (5,1), (1,5), (3,2)]. So these cells are blocked and cannot be moved into.\n> \n> Snake positions: only [(3,5)]. That means the snake has only one segment? That can't be right for a snake game. Let me read: \"Snake Positions: [(3,5)]\". And it says \"head first\", but there's only one position. Maybe the snake is just the head? But in snake, the snake should have a body, but here it's given as a list with one element. Perhaps it's a new snake with length 1. That makes sense for the start.\n> \n> Snake head direction is U, meaning up.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (4,5) with life span 8, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (3,6) with life span 8, value 1\n> \n> - (2,6) with life span 8, value 1\n> \n> - (4,6) with life span 9, value 1\n> \n> All food has value 1, so all are positive. No negative food here.\n> \n> Current turn: t=2.\n> \n> I need to plan an action sequence for at least 5 turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n> \n> Since the snake has only one segment, moving to a food will increase length to 2. But let's think carefully.\n> \n> First, let's sketch the grid.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls at borders, so playable area: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6.\n> \n> Obstacles:\n> \n> - (5,6)\n> \n> - (1,4)\n> \n> - (4,4)\n> \n> - (2,4)\n> \n> - (6,3)\n> \n> - (5,1)\n> \n> - (1,5)\n> \n> - (3,2)\n> \n> Snake head at (3,5), direction U (up).\n> \n> Food at:\n> \n> - (4,5) - right of head, same y\n> \n> - (3,6) - above head, since direction is U, and (3,5) to (3,6) is up\n> \n> - (2,6) - left and up\n> \n> - (4,6) - right and up\n> \n> Current turn t=2.\n> \n> I need to move the snake. Possible moves: U, D, L, R. But since direction is U, I can't do instant reverse to D. So I can go U, L, or R. Not D.\n> \n> Now, from (3,5):\n> \n> - U: to (3,6)\n> \n> - D: to (3,4) but D is reverse, so not allowed? Direction is U, so opposite is D. So I cannot move D this turn.\n> \n> - L: to (2,5)\n> \n> - R: to (4,5)\n> \n> Now, let's see what cells are safe.\n> \n> First, (3,6) has food, value 1. If I move U to (3,6), I eat the food there. Since snake is length 1, after eating, it becomes length 2. The head moves to (3,6), and the tail was at (3,5), but since it grows, the tail stays or what? Standard snake: when you eat, you grow, so after moving to food, the head is at food, and tail doesn't move, so new position: head at (3,6), and tail at (3,5), so snake becomes [(3,6), (3,5)].\n> \n> Similarly, if I move to (4,5), I eat the food there, snake becomes [(4,5), (3,5)].\n> \n> Now, risks: since snake is short, no body collision yet.\n> \n> Also, walls and obstacles.\n> \n> (3,6) is within bounds? x=3, y=6. y=6 is playable since y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=1 to 6, so y=6 is the top row, but not wall, it's playable. Similarly, x=3 is fine.\n> \n> Is (3,6) an obstacle? Obstacles are given, (3,6) not listed, so safe.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,5): x=4,y=5, not wall, not obstacle, safe.\n> \n> (2,5): x=2,y=5, should be safe, no obstacle there.\n> \n> (3,4): but I cannot move down, reverse not allowed.\n> \n> Now, also, food at (3,6) has life span 8, meaning it will disappear after 8 turns, including current? Life span decreases every turn, including current.\n> \n> Current turn t=2, food at (3,6) life span 8, so it will disappear at turn 2 + 8 - 1? Let's clarify life span.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So for food at turn t with life span L, it will disappear after L turns, meaning it is present for turns t to t+L-1? Or t to t+L?\n> \n> Example: if at turn t, life span L, then after one turn, at t+1, life span is L-1. When life span reaches 0, it disappears.\n> \n> So at turn t, life span L, it will disappear at turn t + L, because after L decreases, at turn t+L, life span is 0, so not present.\n> \n> Let's think: at turn t, life span L. After turn t, countdown decreases, so at start of turn t+1, life span is L-1. Similarly, at start of turn t+L, life span is 0, so food disappears before turn t+L or at?\n> \n> The state is given at the start of turn t, before action.\n> \n> After I move, the state updates.\n> \n> For life span: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So at current turn t, before action, food has life span L.\n> \n> After I take action and move, the turn ends, so countdown decreases by 1.\n> \n> So for food with life span L at turn t, after turn t, life span becomes L-1 for turn t+1.\n> \n> It disappears when life span reaches 0, so at the start of turn when life span is 0, food is gone.\n> \n> So for food at (3,6) with life span 8 at turn 2, it will be present until turn 2 + 8 - 1 = 9? Let's see:\n> \n> At turn 2: life span 8\n> \n> After turn 2: life span decreases to 7, and food still there for turn 3.\n> \n> At turn 3: life span 7\n> \n> After turn 3: decreases to 6, and so on.\n> \n> At turn 9: life span would be 8 - (9-2) = 8 - 7 = 1? Let's calculate decrease.\n> \n> From turn 2 to turn 3, life span decreases by 1, so from 8 to 7.\n> \n> At turn t, life span is L, then at turn t+1, life span is L-1.\n> \n> So at turn 2, life span 8\n> \n> Turn 3: 7\n> \n> ...\n> \n> Turn 9: 8 - (9-2) = 8 - 7 = 1? 9-2=7, so 8-7=1, so at turn 9, life span 1\n> \n> Then after turn 9, it decreases to 0 and disappears, so not available at turn 10.\n> \n> Similarly, it disappears at the end of turn when life span becomes 0, so for turn t, if life span L, it is available for L turns starting from t, so from t to t+L-1.\n> \n> At turn t, available with L.\n> \n> After turn t, L-1, available for turn t+1 if L-1 >0, etc.\n> \n> So at turn t, it can be eaten during turn t, and it will be present until the start of turn t+L, when life span becomes 0, it is removed.\n> \n> \"Disappears after N turns\" – after N turns from now.\n> \n> At turn t, with life span N, it disappears after N turns, meaning at turn t+N, it is gone.\n> \n> For example, at turn 2, life span 8, it will disappear after 8 turns, so at turn 10, it is not there.\n> \n> Turn 2: present\n> \n> Turn 3: present\n> \n> ...\n> \n> Turn 9: present (after 7 turns from turn 2)\n> \n> After 8 turns from turn 2 is turn 10, so at turn 10, it is disappeared.\n> \n> Similarly, for turn t, food with life span N is present from turn t to turn t+N-1.\n> \n> At turn t+N, it is gone.\n> \n> In this case, all food has life span at least 8, and current turn 2, so they last until turn 9 or 10, plenty of time, no urgency.\n> \n> Now, back to movement.\n> \n> Snake is at (3,5), direction U.\n> \n> I can move U, L, or R.\n> \n> If I move U to (3,6), I eat the food at (3,6), snake grows to [(3,6), (3,5)], length 2.\n> \n> Then head direction becomes U.\n> \n> If I move R to (4,5), eat food at (4,5), snake becomes [(4,5), (3,5)], head direction R.\n> \n> If I move L to (2,5), no food there, so snake moves to (2,5), but since no food, length remains 1, so snake is just [(2,5)], but after moving, the head is at new position, and since no grow, tail disappears, but here snake was length 1, so if no eat, snake moves to new cell, and since no tail, it might be just the head at new position.

Snake length = 2.\n- **Head Direction**: R (right).\n- **Possible Moves** (cannot reverse to L):\n  - U (up): (5,6) → **Blocked** (internal obstacle at (5,6)).\n  - D (down): (5,4) → Free (no obstacle or wall).\n  - R (right): (6,5) → Free (no obstacle or wall).\n  - L (left): (4,5) → Occupied by tail, but **allowed** (tail will move away if no food is eaten).\n\n### Food Analysis:\nAll food is positive (+1 value):\n1. (3,6): Life span = 6 (can be eaten until Turn 9).\n2. (2,6): Life span = 6 (until Turn 9).\n3. (4,6): Life span = 7 (until Turn 10).\n4. (1,1): Life span = 10 (until Turn 13).\n\n### Immediate Action Options:\n1. **Move Left (L) to (4,5)**:\n   - Safe (tail moves away).\n   - Next turn (Turn 5), can move U to (4,6) to eat food (life span 7).\n   - This is the most direct path to food with minimal risk.\n\n2. **Move Right (R) to (6,5)**:\n   - Moves away from food cluster at y=6.\n   - No immediate reward, and future path to food is less clear.\n\n3. **Move Down (D) to (5,4)**:\n   - Moves away from food.\n   - No strategic advantage unless avoiding future obstacles (not currently needed).\n\n### Optimal Choice:\n- **Move Left (L) to (4,5)** is the best immediate action because:\n  - It positions the snake to eat (4,6) on the next turn (Turn 5).\n  - The food at (4,6) has a long life span (7 turns), so no urgency, but this is the most efficient path.\n  - No collision risks or immediate dangers.\n\n### Final Decision:\n\\boxed{L}",

It's turn 6, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think? Let me confirm the coordinates.\n> \n> Walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the grid goes from x=1 to x=6 and y=1 to y=6? No, let's see: border cells are x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7, so moving to x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7 is a wall collision. Also, internal obstacles are given.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (6,6), and body at (6,5). Since it's a list with two positions, that means the snake has length 2: head and one body segment, which is also the tail.\n> \n> Head direction is Up, so it's moving upwards.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (3,6) with value 1, life span 4\n> \n> - (2,6) with value 1, life span 4\n> \n> - (4,6) with value 1, life span 5\n> \n> - (1,1) with value 1, life span 8\n> \n> All food has value 1, so all are positive food.

The rule says: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) | Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So for (3,6), life span 4 at turn 6, so it will disappear after turn 6 + 4 - 1? Let's clarify.\n> \n> If life span is N at turn t, and countdown decreases every turn including current, then at turn t, life span is N, at turn t+1 it's N-1, ..., at turn t + N - 1 it's 1, and it disappears after that, so not available on turn t + N.\n> \n> For example, life span 4 at turn 6: on turn 6, life span 4; turn 7, life span 3; turn 8, life span 2; turn 9, life span 1; after turn 9, it disappears, so not available on turn 10.

So moving Up to (6,7) is invalid, wall collision.\n> \n> - Down: to (6,5), but (6,5) is current tail position. Since it's the tail, and if I move there, normally it should be ok because the tail will move away. But I'm not eating food, so no growth.\n> \n> If I move Down to (6,5), the head moves to (6,5), and since no food eaten, the tail moves from (6,5) to... let's see snake movement.\n> \n> Snake positions: [(6,6), (6,5)] head and body.\n> \n> After moving Down, head moves to (6,5), and the body (which was tail) moves? When snake moves, if no food eaten, head moves to new position, each body segment moves to previous position of the segment before it.\n> \n> So, if head moves Down to (6,5), the body segment (6,5) was there, but head is moving to (6,5), which is occupied by the body. Since it's the tail, and no food, the tail should move to where? The body segment moves to the previous head position only if it's not the tail growing.\n> \n> Standard snake: when head moves to a new cell, if not food, tail moves away; if food, tail stays, length increases.\n> \n> In this case, moving to (6,5): cell (6,5) is currently occupied by the tail. If I move head there, and there is no food there (as per food list, no food at (6,5)), so no food eaten, so the snake should have head at (6,5), and the tail should be removed, so new positions: head at (6,5), and since only one body segment, it disappears? No.\n> \n> Snake has two segments: head at (6,6), body at (6,5). When head moves to (6,5), which is where the body is. But since we're moving to the same cell, and no food, the body segment should be removed, so the snake becomes just head at (6,5), length 1? That doesn't make sense.\n> \n> I think I have a confusion.\n> \n> Typically in snake, when the head moves to a new cell:\n> \n> - If the cell is empty, head moves there, and tail moves one step (so last segment is removed).\n> \n> - If the cell has food, head moves there, food eaten, tail does not move, so length increases.\n> \n> - If the cell is a wall or body, collision.\n> \n> But when moving to the tail cell: if head moves to the cell that is currently occupied by the tail, and there is no food, then since the tail will move away after the head moves, it should be safe. Head moves to tail position, and tail moves to its previous position or something.\n> \n> Let's think carefully.\n> \n> At start: positions [H, T] where H is head, T is tail.\n> \n> After moving head to a direction, say to cell X.\n> \n> If X is not food, and X is the current tail position, then head moves to X, and since T was there, but now head is there, and T needs to move. But T was the last segment, so if head moves to T's position, and no food, then the snake should have head at X (which was T), and T is removed, so snake becomes just [H] at X, length 1. But that means the snake shortened, which is not right; it should stay the same length if no food eaten.\n> \n> I think I have a mistake.\n> \n> In standard snake mechanics, when the snake moves, the head moves to a new cell, and each subsequent segment moves to the position of the previous segment. So for a snake with segments S0 (head), S1, S2, ..., Sk (tail).\n> \n> After move: new head position based on direction, then S1 moves to old S0 position, S2 moves to old S1 position, ..., Sk moves to old S_{k-1} position, and the old Sk position is vacated.\n> \n> So for a length 2 snake: positions [H, T].\n> \n> Head moves to new cell, say new_H.\n> \n> Then T moves to old H position.\n> \n> So new positions: [new_H, old_H].\n> \n> If new_H is the same as T, that means T was at some position, head moves to that position, then T moves to old H position.\n> \n> So for example, head at (6,6), T at (6,5).\n> \n> If head moves Down to (6,5), new_head = (6,5).\n> \n> Then T moves to old head position (6,6).\n> \n> So new snake positions: head at (6,5), body at (6,6). So the snake has effectively turned around.\n> \n> And no collision because when head moves to (6,5), T is still at (6,5) for a moment, but since T moves away immediately after, it's not a collision. The rule says \"you can move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> Similarly, if there was food at (6,5), and head moves there, then food is eaten, so T does not move, so head and T are both at (6,5) after, which causes collision.\n> \n> But in this case, no food at (6,5), so moving Down to (6,5) is safe.\n> \n> Now, back to possible moves from (6,6) direction Up.\n> \n> - Up: to (6,7), y=7 is wall, invalid.\n> \n> - Down: to (6,5), which is current tail, but as above, it should be safe since no food there.\n> \n> - Left: to (5,6)\n> \n> - Right: to (7,6), but x=7 is wall, invalid.\n> \n> So possible moves: Down, Left, or Up (invalid), Right (invalid), so only Down or Left.\n> \n> Down to (6,5) or Left to (5,6).\n> \n> Now, check if (5,6) is obstacle?
