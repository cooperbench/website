        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at (0, 0) at turn t_1 = 8. The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimum number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. The vertical axis goes from y=0 to y=9, so freeways are from y=1 to y=8, meaning the player needs to cross these to get to y=9.\n\nThe player moves vertically: up (U) increases y by 1, down (D) decreases y by 1, or stay (S) keeps y the same. y must stay between 0 and 9 inclusive.\n\nNow, about the cars: all cars are moving right, as per the direction given. For each freeway, there are cars listed with their positions at turn t_1=8.\n\nLet me list out the car positions at t_1=8 for each freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: two cars: (-48, -59, right, 6) and (0, -11, right, 6)\n\nFreeway 2: same as freeway 1: (-48, -59, right, 6) and (0, -11, right, 6)\n\nFreeway 3: same\n\nFreeway 4: same\n\nFreeway 5: three cars: (-48, -59, right, 6), (-12, -23, right, 6), (24, 13, right, 6)\n\nFreeway 6: same as freeway 5\n\nFreeway 7: same\n\nFreeway 8: same\n\nAll cars are moving right with speed 6, meaning they move 6 units per turn to the right.\n\nThe collision condition: a collision occurs at turn T if the player is on freeway y at that turn, and for some car on that freeway, 0 is in the span of the car at turn T. Since the player is at x=0 always, I think, because it says \"position (0, y_t)\", so x is fixed at 0. So collision happens if at turn T, on freeway k, there is a car whose span includes 0 at that turn.\n\nThe span is given for left-moving or right-moving, but all cars here are right-moving, so for right-moving, span at time T is [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]? Let's see the update rule.\n\nFor right-moving: Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nIn the notation, it says for right-moving: Span(t_1) = [τ, h], but in the car state, it's given as (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s). What is head and tail?\n\nFor right-moving, head is the front, I assume, so if moving right, head is to the right, tail to the left. In the span, it says Span(t_1) = [τ, h] for right-moving, which might mean from tail to head, so if tail is left, head is right, [τ, h] with τ < h for right-moving.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but all are right-moving here.\n\nIn the car state, for example, first car: (-48, -59, right, 6). Head h = -48, tail τ = -59? But -48 > -59, so if tail is -59 and head is -48, that means the car is from x=-59 to x=-48, so span [-59, -48]? But for right-moving, Span(t_1) should be [τ, h], so if τ = -59, h = -48, then [ -59, -48 ], and since moving right, at time T, Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)] = [-59 + 6(T-8), -48 + 6(T-8)]\n\nSimilarly, the second car on freeway 1: (0, -11, right, 6), so h=0, τ=-11, so at t_1=8, span is [τ, h] = [-11, 0]\n\nh=0, τ=-11, so from -11 to 0.\n\nAt exactly t_1=8, for this car, span includes 0, since [ -11, 0 ], so x=0 is included.\n\nBut the player is at y=0 at t_1=8, and freeways are from y=1 to y=8, so y=0 is not a freeway, I think. The collision is only on freeways y=1 to 8, so at y=0, no collision possible.\n\nSimilarly, y=9 might be safe, but we need to reach (0,9).\n\nNow, for the player to be on a freeway, y from 1 to 8.\n\nAt turn T, if player is on y=k (1 to 8), and for a car on that freeway, 0 is in Span(T), then collision.\n\nAlso, note: if you move to a different y at turn T, you are not on that y until the next turn or something? Let's see the note.\n\n\"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nThe action at turn T determines y_{T+1}.\n\nLet me read carefully.\n\nPlayer update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, where Δy_t depends on a_t.\n\nSo at turn t, you choose action a_t, which determines the change, and y_{t+1} is set accordingly.\n\nNow, when is the position considered? At each turn, I think we consider y_t at turn t.\n\nCollision at turn T only if on freeway y_T, and 0 in some car span on that freeway at turn T.\n\nThe note says: if at turn T, you choose to move to a different y, meaning a_t such that y_{T+1} ≠ y_T, then at turn T, you are still on y_T, not on y_{T+1}.\n\nSo, for collision at turn T, it depends on y_T and the cars at turn T on that row.\n\nIf you stay or move, at turn T, you are on y_T.\n\nThen after action, y_{T+1} is new position.\n\nBut for collision, it's checked at each turn based on current y_t.\n\nThe note clarifies that when you move to a new row, you are not on that new row during the turn you move; you arrive at the next turn.\n\nIn this case, since you move at turn T, y_{T+1} is set, but at turn T, you are on y_T.\n\nSo for example, if at turn T, you are on y=k, and you choose U, then y_{T+1} = k+1, but at turn T, position is (0,k), so collision depends on cars on row k at turn T.\n\nSimilarly, if you choose D or S.\n\nNow, back to the cars.\n\nAt t_1=8, for freeways 1-4, there are two cars each: one with span at t_1: [-59, -48] and [-11, 0] for the right-moving with speed 6.\n\nFor [-11,0] at t_1=8, span includes 0, so if player is on that freeway at turn 8, collision, but player is at y=0, not on freeway.\n\nSimilarly for other freeways 1-4 same.\n\nFor freeways 5-8, three cars: [-59,-48], [-23,-12]? Let's see: car (-12, -23, right, 6), head h=-12, tail τ=-23, so since right-moving, span [τ, h] = [-23, -12]\n\nSimilarly, (24,13, right,6), head 24, tail 13? 13 to 24, so [13,24]\n\nAnd (-48,-59) same as before.\n\nNow, at turn T, for a car, Span(T) = [τ + s(T-8), h + s(T-8)] for right-moving, since t_1=8.\n\ns=6 for all.\n\nNow, collision on row k at turn T if player is on y=k (1≤k≤8) and 0 is in Span(T) for some car on that row.\n\nSince the cars move, we need to find when 0 is covered for each row.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway, the times when 0 is occupied by a car.\n\nSince all cars on a row are identical for rows 1-4, and for 5-8, but rows 1-4 have the same cars, similarly 5-8.\n\nBut we need per row, but since the car states are same for rows 1-4, and same for 5-8, the collision times will be the same for rows in the same group.\n\nBut we need to consider each row separately, but since identical, we can treat them similarly.\n\nFirst, for freeway 1 (and similarly 2,3,4):\n\nCars:\n\nCar A: τ=-59, h=-48, s=6\n\nCar B: τ=-11, h=0, s=6\n\nAt time T, Span_A(T) = [-59 + 6(T-8), -48 + 6(T-8)]\n\nSpan_B(T) = [-11 + 6(T-8), 0 + 6(T-8)] = [-11 + 6(T-8), 6(T-8)]\n\n0 is in Span_B(T) when -11 + 6(T-8) ≤ 0 ≤ 6(T-8)\n\nSince the span is [low, high] with low ≤ high.\n\nSo for Span_B(T), low = -11 + 6(T-8), high = 6(T-8)\n\n0 in span if low ≤ 0 ≤ high, so:\n\n-11 + 6(T-8) ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ 6(T-8)\n\nFirst, 0 ≤ 6(T-8) ⇒ T-8 ≥ 0 ⇒ T ≥ 8\n\nSecond, -11 + 6(T-8) ≤ 0 ⇒ 6(T-8) ≤ 11 ⇒ T-8 ≤ 11/6 ≈ 1.833, so T ≤ 8 + 1.833 = 9.833, since T integer, T ≤ 9\n\nT-8 ≤ 11/6 ≈ 1.833, so T ≤ 9 since T integer.\n\nSimilarly, from above T ≥ 8.\n\nSo for Span_B, 0 in span at T=8 and T=9.\n\nAt T=8: low = -11 + 0 = -11, high=0, so [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nAt T=9: low = -11 + 6(1) = -5, high=6, so [-5,6], 0 included.\n\nAt T=10: low = -11 + 12 =1, high=12, [1,12], 0 not included.\n\nSimilarly, for Span_A(T): low = -59 + 6(T-8), high = -48 + 6(T-8)\n\n0 in span if low ≤ 0 ≤ high\n\n-59 + 6(T-8) ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ -48 + 6(T-8)\n\nFirst, 0 ≤ -48 + 6(T-8) ⇒ 48 ≤ 6(T-8) ⇒ 8 ≤ T-8 ⇒ T ≥ 16\n\nSecond, -59 + 6(T-8) ≤ 0 ⇒ 6(T-8) ≤ 59 ⇒ T-8 ≤ 59/6 ≈ 9.833 ⇒ T ≤ 17.833, so T ≤ 17\n\nBut from first, T ≥ 16, so T=16,17\n\nAt T=16: low = -59 + 6(8) = -59 + 48 = -11, high = -48 + 48 = 0, so [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nT=17: low = -59 + 54 = -5, high = -48 + 54 = 6, [-5,6], 0 included.\n\nT=18: low = -59 + 60 =1, high= -48+60=12, [1,12], 0 not.\n\nBut for row 1, car B covers T=8,9 and car A covers T=16,17, but since we are starting from T=8, and we care about small T for minimum moves, T=16,17 might be far, but we need to see.\n\nFor freeway 1, at T=8 and T=9, car B has 0 covered.\n\nSimilarly for rows 2,3,4 same.\n\nNow for freeways 5-8:\n\nCars: car C: (-48,-59,right,6) same as above, τ=-59,h=-48\n\nCar D: (-12,-23,right,6) so τ=-23, h=-12\n\nCar E: (24,13,right,6) head 24, tail 13, so τ=13, h=24? In the state: (24,13,right,6), but for right-moving, span [τ,h], so if tail τ=13, head h=24, then [13,24]\n\nBut 13 to 24, moving right.\n\nSimilarly, car D: (-12,-23,right,6), tail τ=-23, head h=-12, so [-23,-12]\n\nCar C: same as before [-59,-48]\n\nNow, for row 5 (and 6,7,8), at time T:\n\nSpan_C(T) = [-59 + 6(T-8), -48 + 6(T-8)] same as car A above.\n\nSpan_D(T) = [-23 + 6(T-8), -12 + 6(T-8)]\n\nSpan_E(T) = [13 + 6(T-8), 24 + 6(T-8)]\n\nNow, find when 0 in each span.\n\nFirst, Span_C: as before, 0 in span at T=16,17 only.\n\nSpan_D: low = -23 + 6(T-8), high = -12 + 6(T-8)\n\n0 in span if low ≤ 0 ≤ high\n\n-23 + 6(T-8) ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ -12 + 6(T-8)\n\nFirst, 0 ≤ -12 + 6(T-8) ⇒ 12 ≤ 6(T-8) ⇒ 2 ≤ T-8 ⇒ T ≥ 10\n\nSecond, -23 + 6(T-8) ≤ 0 ⇒ 6(T-8) ≤ 23 ⇒ T-8 ≤ 23/6 ≈ 3.833 ⇒ T ≤ 11.833, so T ≤ 11\n\nThus T=10,11\n\nAt T=10: low = -23 + 6(2) = -23+12= -11, high= -12+12=0, so [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nT=11: low = -23 + 18 = -5, high= -12+18=6, [-5,6], 0 included.\n\nT=12: low= -23+24=1, high= -12+24=12, [1,12], 0 not.\n\nSpan_E: low = 13 + 6(T-8), high=24 + 6(T-8)\n\n0 in span if low ≤ 0 ≤ high\n\nBut low =13 + 6(T-8) ≥ 13 >0 for T≥8, so low >0, so 0 < low ≤ high, so 0 not in span, ever, since min low at T=8 is 13>0.\n\nSimilarly for higher T, even larger.\n\nSo for row 5, only cars C and D matter, but car C at T=16,17 which is late, and car D at T=10,11.\n\nAt T=8: for row 5, car D: at T=8, low=-23 +0= -23, high= -12, so [-23,-12], 0 not in, since -12 <0? -23 to -12, all negative, 0 not in.\n\nCar C: [-59,-48], 0 not.\n\nCar E: [13,24], 0 not.\n\nSo at T=8, no car covers 0 on row 5.\n\nSimilarly, T=9: Span_D: low= -23 +6(1)= -17, high= -12+6= -6, [-17,-6], 0 not.\n\nSpan_C: [-59+6= -53, -48+6= -42], 0 not.\n\nSpan_E: [13+6=19,24+6=30], 0 not.\n\nT=10: Span_D: low= -23+12= -11, high= -12+12=0, [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nSimilarly, T=11: [-5,6], 0 included.\n\nT=12: [1,12], 0 not.\n\nAnd car C at T=16,17.\n\nBut for minimum time, T=10 and 11 are covered.\n\nSimilarly for rows 6,7,8 same as row 5.\n\nNow, row 1: at T=8 and 9 covered by car B.\n\nSummary of unsafe times for each row:\n\n- Rows 1,2,3,4: unsafe at T=8 and T=9\n\n- Rows 5,6,7,8: unsafe at T=10 and T=11\n\nUnsafe meaning if player is on that row at that turn, collision occurs.\n\nAlso, at other times, safe on that row.\n\nPlayer starts at t=8, y=0.\n\nGoal: reach y=9.\n\ny must be integer, from 0 to 9.\n\nActions: U, D, S, changing y by +1, -1, 0.\n\nMinimum H, the number of turns, meaning from t=8 to t=8+H-1, so after H actions, position at turn t=8+H-1 should be y=9.\n\nLet t be the turn index.\n\nAt turn 8: position y=0.\n\nAfter action a_8, y_9 = y_8 + Δy_8\n\nAfter a_9, y_10, and so on.\n\nWe need y_{8 + K} = 9 for some K, and K is the number of actions, so H = K, and the turn when reached is t = 8 + K - 1? Let's see.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t.\n\nAfter H actions, from t=8 to t=8+H-1, so y_{8+H-1} =9.\n\nFor example, if no action, at t=8, y=0.\n\nAfter one action, at t=9, y_9 could be 0,1, or -1 but y min 0, so if D, y=0 if y>0, but y=0, D would make y=-1, but y must be >=0, so probably y clamped? But in the update, it says y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, and y_{t+1} in [0,9], so if y_t=0 and a_t=D, Δy_t=-1, but y_{t+1} = -1 not in [0,9], so probably not allowed, or clamped to 0. Similarly for y=9 and U.\n\nThe update says y_{t+1} in [0,9], so I think it is clamped, so if y_t=0 and a_t=D, y_{t+1}=0, similarly if y_t=9 and a_t=U, y_{t+1}=9.\n\nIn the collision, only on freeways y=1-8, y=0 and y=9 are safe.\n\nNow, to reach y=9 from y=0, minimum steps: if we go up every turn, from y=0 to y=9, it takes 9 steps: after 9 U actions, y_9 to y_17, let's see.\n\nAt t=8, y=0.\n\nAfter a_8: if U, y_9=1\n\na_9: U, y_10=2\n\n...\n\nAfter 9 U actions, y_{17} =9? Start: t=8, y=0\n\nAfter first U (a_8), t=9, y=1\n\na_9, t=10, y=2\n\n...\n\na_{16}, t=17, y=9\n\nSo from t=9 to t=17, y from 1 to 9, but reached at t=17.\n\nNumber of actions: from t=8 to t=16, actions at t=8 to t=16, 9 actions, y_{17}=9.\n\nt=8: after 0 actions, y=0\n\nAfter 1 action at t=8, y at t=9\n\n...\n\nAfter k actions (at t=8 to t=8+k-1), y at t=8+k.\n\nSet y_{8+H} =9? No.\n\nDefine: let the turn when we reach y=9 be T_final.\n\nAt turn T_final, y_{T_final} =9.\n\nT_final >=9 since y=0 at t=8.\n\nThe actions are taken from t=8 to t= T_final -1, since each action determines next position.\n\nAt turn t, we take action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nSo to have y_{t} = something.\n\nStart: at t=8, y_8=0.\n\nWe take actions a_8, a_9, ..., up to a_{T-1} for some T, such that y_T =9.\n\nThen the number of actions is (T - 8), and H = number of turns from start to end, but the sequence is from t=8 to t= T-1? The problem says:\n\n\"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" so t from 0 to H-1, so actions at time t_1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nAnd after H actions, position at t_1 + H should be the final position? Let's see.\n\nAfter actions from t=0 to H-1, position at time t_1 + H.\n\nIn the problem: \"reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1\"\n\n\"y_{t_1 + H -1} =9\"\n\nAnd actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}, so for t from 0 to H-1, actions at time t_1 + t.\n\nFor example, if H=1, actions at t_1 +0 = t_1, and position at t_1 + H -1 = t_1 +1 -1 = t_1, so at turn t_1, y_{t_1} should be 9, but at start y=0, not 9, so H at least 2? Let's see.\n\nAt turn t_1, position (0,y_{t_1}), here y_8=0.\n\nAfter action a_{t_1}, y_{t_1+1} is set.\n\nWe need y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nFor H=1: position at t_1 +1 -1 = t_1, y_{t_1}=0 ≠9, not.\n\nH=2: position at t_1 +2-1 = t_1 +1, y_{t_1+1}, which could be 1 if U, not 9.\n\n...\n\nTo reach y=9 from y=0, minimum H such that y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nSince y increases by at most 1 per action, need at least 9 actions to go from 0 to 9.\n\nWith 9 actions: from t_1 to t_1+8, actions at t=8 to 16, y at t=17 should be 9.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =8 + H -1.\n\nSet this to T_final.\n\ny_{8 + H -1} =9.\n\nWith no delay, 8 + H -1 =8+9-1=16? Let's calculate min T_final.\n\nFrom y=0 at t=8, after k up moves, y_{8+k} =k, since each up increases y by 1.\n\ny_{t+1} = y_t +1 if U, so from t=8, y_8=0\n\ny_9 = y_8 + Δy_8, if U, y_9=1\n\ny_10=2 if U, etc.\n\nSo y_t = y_8 + number of U up to t-1 minus number of D, but since we go up, assume all U.\n\ny_t = (t - 8) for t from 9 to 17, but y_9=1, y_10=2, ..., y_17=9.\n\nSo to have y_t=9, t=17.\n\nThus T_final=17.\n\nWith H actions, y_{8+H} = ? After H actions, y at time 8+H.\n\ny_{8} =0\n\nAfter first action, y_{9} = y_8 + Δy_8\n\n...\n\nAfter H actions, y_{8+H} = y_8 + sum of Δy from t=8 to t=8+H-1.\n\nTo reach 9, sum Δy =9.\n\nEach |Δy| <=1, so min H=9, with all U.\n\nThen y_{8+9} = y_{17} =9.\n\nNow, position at turn t_1 + H -1 =8 + H -1.\n\nWith H=9, t_1 + H -1 =8+9-1=16, but y_{16} should be 9? Contradiction.\n\nI think I confused the indices.\n\nLet me read the problem carefully.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1\"\n\nSo reach at turn t = t_1 + H -1.\n\nFor example, at H=1, reach at t_1 +1 -1 = t_1, so at start turn, but y=0 not 9.\n\nH=2, reach at t_1 +2-1 = t_1 +1, y_{t_1+1} could be 1 if U, not 9.\n\n...\n\nWith H actions, we reach at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nAfter H actions, position at time t_1 + H.\n\nBut the reach turn is t_1 + H -1, so y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nFor example, at t_1 + H -1, position is 9.\n\nBut the actions affect the next position.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t is given, then we choose a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nSo at turn t_1 + H -1, we have y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nThis is after we have taken actions from t_1 to t_1 + H -2? Let's see.\n\nThe actions are from t=0 to H-1 for the sequence index, but time is t_1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nSo actions at time: t_1, t_1+1, ..., t_1 + H-1.\n\nThen after these actions, the position at time t_1 + H should be set, but we care about position at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nThe position at turn τ is y_τ.\n\nFor τ = t_1 + H -1, we want y_τ =9.\n\nThe actions taken before τ affect y_τ.\n\nSpecifically, actions at times before τ determine y_τ.\n\nActions at time t affect y_{t+1}.\n\nSo for y_τ, it is affected by actions at t= τ-1, τ-2, ..., but also the initial position.\n\nSince y_{t+1} depends on y_t and a_t.\n\nTo have y_τ =9 for τ = t_1 + H -1.\n\nFrom t_1 to τ, there are (τ - t_1) actions taken? From time t_1 to τ-1, actions at t_1 to τ-1 determine y_τ.\n\nFor example, τ = t_1 + H -1.\n\nThen actions at t_1 to (t_1 + H -1) -1 = t_1 + H -2.\n\nBut the action sequence includes a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H-1}, which is H actions.\n\nFor position at τ = t_1 + H -1, it is determined by actions up to time τ-1 = t_1 + H -2.\n\nBut the sequence has actions up to a_{t_1 + H-1}, which affects y_{t_1 + H}, not y_τ.\n\nThere's a mismatch.\n\nLet's read the answer format: \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc, up to some turn.\n\nAnd \"y_{t_1 + H -1} =9\"\n\nWith the actions from t_1 to t_1 + H-1.\n\nBut action at t_1 + H-1 affects y_{t_1 + H}, not y_{t_1 + H-1}.\n\nSo for y_{t_1 + H-1}, it is not directly affected by a_{t_1 + H-1}; a_{t_1 + H-1} affects y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nThe position at turn t is y_t, before any action at that turn.\n\nThen we choose a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nSo at turn t, we are at y_t, choose a_t, go to y_{t+1}.\n\nFor the final position at turn T, we want y_T =9.\n\nT = t_1 + H -1.\n\nThe actions taken are from t_1 to T-1, because action at t determines y_{t+1}, so for y_T, it is determined by actions at t= t_1 to T-1.\n\nNumber of actions: from t_1 to T-1 inclusive, that's (T-1) - t_1 +1 = T - t_1 actions.\n\nBut H is the number of actions in the sequence, which is for t from 0 to H-1, so times t_1 to t_1+H-1, so H actions.\n\nThen for position at T = t_1 + H -1, the actions that determine y_T are from t_1 to T-1 = t_1 to (t_1 + H -1) -1 = t_1 to t_1 + H -2.\n\nBut the sequence includes a_{t_1 + H-1}, which is not used for y_T; it affects y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nSo to have y_T =9 with T = t_1 + H-1, we need actions from t_1 to T-1, which is from t_1 to (t_1 + H -1) -1 = t_1 to t_1 + H -2.\n\nBut the sequence has H actions, from t_1 to t_1+H-1, so the last action a_{t_1+H-1} is extra for this position.\n\nFor example, suppose H=1, T= t_1 +1-1 = t_1, position at t_1, y_{t_1}, which is given, not 9.\n\nH=2, T= t_1 +2-1 = t_1 +1, position at t_1+1, which is determined by a_{t_1}, so we need a_{t_1} such that y_{t_1+1} =9, but from y=0, impossible in one action.\n\nSimilarly, for y_T=9, with T= t_1 + H -1, we need to go from y_{t_1} =0 to y_T=9, so the number of actions taken is from t_1 to T-1, number of actions = (T-1) - t_1 +1 = T - t_1.\n\nBut T = t_1 + H -1, so number of actions = (t_1 + H -1) - t_1 = H-1.\n\nThen the sequence has H actions, so there is one extra action.\n\nThe sequence includes a_T, which affects y_{T+1}, but we don't care about that.\n\nIn the context, for the position at T= t_1 + H -1 to be 9, we need actions from t_1 to T-1, which is H-1 actions.\n\nBut the sequence is given for H actions, including a_T.\n\nPerhaps it's a bit messy, but for the purpose, we can ignore that and just find the sequence to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nSince y must be 9 at turn T= t_1 + H -1, and with actions from t_1 to t_1+H-1.\n\nBut to minimize H, we want T as small as possible.\n\nMin T such that y_T=9.\n\nFrom y8=0, min T=17 with all U.\n\nThen T=17, so t_1 + H -1 =17, t_1=8, so 8 + H -1 =17, thus H-1=9, H=10.\n\nThen actions from t=8 to t=8+10-1=17? Let's calculate.\n\nT = t_1 + H -1 =17\n\n8 + H -1 =17, so H-1=9, H=10.\n\nActions at t=8 to t=8+10-1=17, so a8 to a17.\n\nBut a17 affects y18, not y17.\n\ny17 is determined by actions up to a16.\n\nWith a8 to a16: 9 actions (t=8 to 16), y17=9.\n\nThen the sequence has 9 actions for H=10? Inconsistency.\n\nPerhaps I should accept the definition and proceed.\n\nTo reach y_T=9 at T=17, with T= t_1 + H -1 =8 + H -1, so 8+H-1=17, H=10.\n\nThen actions at t=8 to t=8+10-1=17.\n\nBut with actions a8 to a16, we have y17=9, but a17 is also included, which we can set to S or something, but y17 is already 9, so a17 can be S, then y18=9.\n\nBut the position is at T=17.\n\nFor collision, we need to ensure that at each turn t from 8 to 16, when on y_t, no collision, but at t=17, y=9, not on freeway, safe.\n\nSo for turns t=8 to 16, we are on y=0 to 8, but y=0 and y=9 safe, only y=1 to 8 need check collision.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t=8 to t=17 for H=10.\n\nBut let's first find the minimum T.\n\nWith no cars, min T=17 with 9 up moves.\n\nBut with cars, we may need to delay or something to avoid collision.\n\nPlayer starts at y=0 at t=8, safe.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nThe dangerous rows are rows 1-4 at t=8 and 9, and rows 5-8 at t=10 and 11.\n\nIf we go straight up:\n\nAt t=8, y=0, safe.\n\na8=U, then at t=9, y=1\n\nBut at t=9, on row 1, which is unsafe at t=9, since for row 1, t=9 covered.\n\nSimilarly, if we go to y=1 at t=9, collision.\n\nSo cannot go directly.\n\nAt t=8, if we stay, a8=S, then y9=0, still safe.\n\nThen at t=9, if U, y10=1.\n\nBut at t=10, y=1, but row 1 is unsafe only at t=8 and9, at t=10, for row 1, at t=10, is it safe?\n\nFor row 1, cars: at t=10, car B: Span_B(10) = [-11 +6(2), 6(2)] = [-11+12, 12] = [1,12], 0 not in, since 1>0.\n\nCar A at t=10: low= -59+12= -47, high= -48+12= -36? -48 +6(10-8)= -48+12= -36, low= -59+12= -47, so [-47,-36], 0 not in.\n\nSo at t=10, row 1 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, row 1 unsafe only at t=8 and9.\n\nSimilarly for other rows.\n\nNow, rows 5-8 unsafe at t=10 and11.\n\nBack to the path.\n\nPlayer at t=8, y=0.\n\nIf we go up at t=8, to y=1 at t=9, but at t=9, y=1, and row 1 unsafe, collision.\n\nIf we stay at t=8, a8=S, then y9=0.\n\nThen at t=9, we can go up, a9=U, then y10=1.\n\nAt t=10, y=1, which is row 1, and at t=10, row 1 is safe, as above.\n\nThen we can continue up.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9.\n\nAt t=10, y=1.\n\nThen a10=U, y11=2.\n\nt=11, y=2, row 2, which is similar to row 1, unsafe at t=8,9, but t=11>9, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, a11=U, y12=3\n\na12=U, y13=4\n\nNow at y=4, row 4, which is like row 1, safe at t=13.\n\nThen a13=U, y14=5\n\nNow y=5 at t=14, row 5.\n\nRow 5 unsafe at t=10 and11, but t=14>11, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, a14=U, y15=6\n\na15=U, y16=7\n\na16=U, y17=8\n\na17=U, y18=9\n\nBut we need y_T=9 at T=t_1 + H -1=8+H-1.\n\nWith y18=9, T=18.\n\nThen 8+H-1=18, so H-1=10, H=11.\n\nActions from t=8 to t=8+11-1=17? t_1 + H -1 =17 for actions, but let's list.\n\nFrom above, with one stay at beginning:\n\nt=8: y=0, action S, then y9=0\n\nt=9: y=0, action U, y10=1\n\nt=10: y=1, action U, y11=2\n\nt=11: y=2, action U, y12=3\n\nt=12: y=3, action U, y13=4\n\nt=13: y=4, action U, y14=5\n\nt=14: y=5, action U, y15=6\n\nt=15: y=6, action U, y16=7\n\nt=16: y=7, action U, y17=8\n\nt=17: y=8, action U, y18=9\n\nSo at turn t=18, y=9.\n\nWe need y at T= t_1 + H -1 =9.\n\nSet T=18, so 8 + H -1 =18, H-1=10, H=11.\n\nActions at t=8 to t=8+11-1=17, so a8 to a17.\n\nIn the sequence, a8=S, a9=U, a10=U, ..., a17=U.\n\nBut a17=U from y17=8 to y18=9.\n\nPosition at T=18 is y18=9.\n\nBut we can reach earlier without the initial stay.\n\nFor example, at t=8, instead of staying, we could go down, but y=0, D would keep y=0, same as S.\n\nOr, we can go up later.\n\nBut min steps to go up is 9, but with delay.\n\nSince rows 1-4 are safe after t=9, and rows 5-8 safe after t=11, we can go up quickly to row 4 or something.\n\nFor example, at t=8, y=0, safe.\n\nWe need to be on row 1 at t>=10, not at t=9.\n\nSimilarly, for row 5, at t>=12, not at t=10 or 11.\n\nt=10 and 11 unsafe for row 5.\n\nSo to avoid row 1 at t=9, we can stay at y=0 for one turn.\n\nThen proceed.\n\nBut in the above, we reached y=9 at t=18 with 10 actions? From t=8 to t=17, 10 actions: a8 to a17, 10 actions.\n\nH=11, actions from t=0 to H-1=10, so 11 actions? t from 0 to 10 for index, times t_1+0 to t_1+10, t=8 to 18.\n\nAction at t=18 affects y19.\n\nI think I have an index problem.\n\nLet's define the reach turn T.\n\nWe want min T such that y_T=9.\n\nFrom start, min T=17 with all U, but with cars, it may be later.\n\nIn all U case: if a8=U, y9=1, but at t=9, y=1, row 1 unsafe, collision, so impossible.\n\nSo min T>17.\n\nWith one stay: as above, T=18.\n\nBut can we reach earlier?\n\nFor example, if we go up at t=8 to y=1 at t=9, collision, not possible.\n\nOr, at t=8, S, y9=0.\n\nThen at t=9, U, y10=1.\n\ny10=1 at t=10, safe for row 1.\n\nThen we can go up each turn to y11=2, y12=3, y13=4, y14=5.\n\nAt t=14, y=5, row 5.\n\nRow 5 unsafe at t=10 and 11, but t=14>11, safe.\n\nThen y15=6, y16=7, y17=8, y18=9.\n\nT=18.\n\nBut at t=14, y=5, we can go faster, but we have to go through each row.\n\nFrom y=5 to y=9, need 4 more up, to t=18.\n\nUnless we can skip some, but no, y changes by 1 each move.\n\nPerhaps we can stay on some row to avoid bad times.\n\nFor example, on row 5, unsafe at t=10 and 11, so if we are on row 5 at other times, safe.\n\nBut we want to go up, so staying may not help.\n\nFor instance, to reach y=5 earlier.\n\nAt t=10, if we are at y=5, but row 5 unsafe at t=10, collision.\n\nSo we need to be on row 5 only after t=11.\n\nSimilarly for row 1, not at t=8 or9.\n\nSo earliest to be on row 1 is t=10.\n\ny=1 at t=10.\n\nThen y=2 at t=11, row 2 safe since t=11>9.\n\ny=3 at t=12, safe.\n\ny=4 at t=13, safe.\n\ny=5 at t=14, row 5 safe since t=14>11.\n\ny=6 at t=15, row 6 similar to row 5, unsafe at t=10,11, t=15>11 safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=7 at t=16, y=8 at t=17, y=9 at t=18.\n\nSame as before.\n\nCan we be on y=5 later, but that would be worse.\n\nOr earlier, but cannot because row 5 unsafe at t=10,11.\n\nFor example, if we reach y=4 earlier.\n\nAt t=8, y=0.\n\nIf we could be at y=1 at t=10, but from t=8 to t=10, we can take actions.\n\nAt t=8, a8=S, y9=0\n\na9=U, y10=1\n\nSo y=1 at t=10.\n\nIf we do a8=U, y9=1 but collision at t=9.\n\nNo other choice.\n\nAt t=8, we could go down, but y=0, D or S both y9=0.\n\nSo only possibility is start with S or D, same, then U at t=9 to y10=1.\n\nThen proceed up.\n\nBut at t=10, y=1, we can go to y=2 at t=11.\n\nBut for rows 5-8, we need to be there after t=11.\n\nFor example, if we go faster to higher rows.\n\nFrom t=10, y=1.\n\nTo reach y=5, we need 4 steps: t=11 y=2, t=12 y=3, t=13 y=4, t=14 y=5.\n\nEarliest y=5 at t=14.\n\nThen to y=9 at t=18.\n\nBut at t=11, y=2, which is fine.\n\nNow, rows 5-8 unsafe at t=10 and 11 only for that row.\n\nBut at t=10, if we were on row 5, collision, but we are on row 1 at t=10, safe.\n\nSimilarly at t=11, we are on row 2 if we go up, safe.\n\nNo issue.\n\nPerhaps we can reach y=9 at t=17 with some path.\n\nSuppose at t=17, y=9.\n\nThen at t=16, y=8, and a16=U to y17=9.\n\nAt t=16, y=8, row 8.\n\nRow 8 unsafe at t=10 and 11, but t=16>11, safe.\n\nSimilarly, at t=15, y=7, row 7 safe.\n\nBut to have y=8 at t=16, we need y=7 at t=15 with a15=U.\n\ny=6 at t=14 with a14=U, and so on.\n\nNow, y=5 at t=13? Let's see the sequence.\n\nSuppose y=5 at t=13.\n\nThen at t=13, y=5, row 5.\n\nRow 5 unsafe at t=10 and 11, t=13>11, safe.\n\nThen a13=U, y14=6\n\na14=U, y15=7\n\na15=U, y16=8\n\na16=U, y17=9\n\nNow, how to have y=5 at t=13.\n\nFrom start, at t=8, y=0.\n\nWe need to reach y=5 by t=13.\n\nWith all U, from y=0 at t=8 to y=5 at t=13: y9=1, y10=2, y11=3, y12=4, y13=5.\n\nBut at t=9, y=1, row 1 unsafe, collision.\n\nSo cannot.\n\nWith delay: at t=8, S, y9=0\n\na9=U, y10=1\n\na10=U, y11=2\n\na11=U, y12=3\n\na12=U, y13=4? y12=3, a12=U, y13=4\n\nThen to y=5 at t=14: a13=U, y14=5\n\nThen as before, y15=6, etc, to y18=9.\n\nIf we want y=5 at t=13, from above, with no delay, y13=5 but at t=9 collision.\n\nWith delay at beginning, we have y10=1, y11=2, y12=3, y13=4, not y=5.\n\nTo have y=5 at t=13, we need y=4 at t=12 with a12=U.\n\nBut y=4 at t=12, how?\n\nIf from y=3 at t=11 with a11=U.\n\ny=2 at t=10 with a10=U.\n\ny=1 at t=9 with a9=U.\n\nBut at t=9, y=1, collision if we do a9=U.\n\nIf a8=U, y9=1, collision.\n\nIf a8=S, y9=0, then a9=U, y10=1, so at t=10, y=1, not at t=9.\n\nThen y=1 at t=10, a10=U, y11=2, a11=U, y12=3, a12=U, y13=4.\n\nCannot have y=5 at t=13 with this.\n\nIf we go up faster, but we can only increase by 1 per turn.\n\nSo minimum time to y=5 is with y=5 at t=13 only if we start from higher, but we start from y=0.\n\nEarliest possible y=5 is at t=13 with all U, but collision at t=9.\n\nWith one stay, earliest y=5 at t=14.\n\nSimilarly, for y=9, earliest without collision is t=18.\n\nBut let's check if we can be on row 5 at t=12.\n\nt=12, row 5: at t=12, is it safe?\n\nFor row 5, unsafe at t=10 and 11, at t=12, car D: Span_D(12) = [-23 +6(4), -12 +6(4)] = [-23+24, -12+24] = [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nCar C: [-59+24, -48+24] = [-35,-24], 0 not.\n\nCar E: [13+24,24+24]= [37,48], 0 not.\n\nSo safe at t=12.\n\nBut to be on y=5 at t=12, we need to reach faster.\n\nFrom t=8, y=0.\n\nTo y=5 at t=12: y9=1, y10=2, y11=3, y12=4? y at t: t=8 y=0, t=9 y=1, t=10 y=2, t=11 y=3, t=12 y=4.\n\ny=4 at t=12.\n\nTo be at y=5 at t=12, impossible because from y=4 at t=11 with a11=U, y12=5, or at t=12 position is after action or before.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t.\n\nTo have y_t=5, for example at t=12, y12=5.\n\nThen it comes from y11 with a11.\n\nIf a11=U and y11=4, then y12=5.\n\nBut y11=4 at t=11.\n\nNow, to have y11=4, from y10 with a10.\n\nIf a10=U and y10=3, etc.\n\nBut at t=9, if y9=1, collision.\n\nSo we cannot have y9=1.\n\nThe only way is to have y9=0, then y10=1, y11=2, y12=3, y13=4, y14=5, etc.\n\nSo y=5 at t=14 earliest.\n\nSimilarly, y=9 at t=18.\n\nPerhaps we can go down and up, but that would take more turns.\n\nFor example, at t=8, go down, but y=0, D keeps y=0.\n\nOr at some point stay to avoid, but since the unsafe times are past for higher rows, staying won't help to go faster.\n\nSo minimum reach turn is t=18 with y=9.\n\nThen T=18.\n\nT = t_1 + H -1 =18\n\nt_1=8, so 8 + H -1 =18, thus H-1=10, H=11.\n\nNow, actions from t=8 to t=8+11-1=17? t_1 + t for t=0 to H-1=10, so times 8 to 17? t from 0 to 10, times t_1+0=8 to t_1+10=18.\n\nAction at t=18? But we need position at T=18.\n\nIn the sequence, actions at t=8 to t=17 for H=11? Let's list the actions.\n\nTo have y18=9, we need a17=U with y17=8.\n\ny17=8 from a16=U with y16=7.\n\n...\n\nFrom start:\n\nAt t=8: y8=0, action S (to stay at y=0 for t=9)\n\nThen at t=9: y9=0, action U, to y10=1\n\nt=10: y10=1, action U, to y11=2\n\nt=11: y11=2, action U, to y12=3\n\nt=12: y12=3, action U, to y13=4\n\nt=13: y13=4, action U, to y14=5\n\nt=14: y14=5, action U, to y15=6\n\nt=15: y15=6, action U, to y16=7\n\nt=16: y16=7, action U, to y17=8\n\nt=17: y17=8, action U, to y18=9\n\nNow, position at turn T= t_1 + H -1 =8 + H -1.\n\nWe want this to be 18, so 8+H-1=18, H=11.\n\nThen actions at times t=8 to t=8+11-1=17? t_1 + t for t=0 to H-1=10, so times: for t=0: time 8, t=1: time 9, ..., t=10: time 18.\n\nAction at time 18: a_{t_1 + 10} = a_{18}\n\nBut in the above, at time t=17, we have action to go to y18=9.\n\nAt time t=18, we are at y18=9, and we can choose a18, but it doesn't affect the position at T=18.\n\nIn the sequence for H=11, actions from t=8 to t=18.\n\nBut at t=18, we need an action, but y is already 9.\n\nWe can set a18=S, for example.\n\nThen position at t=18 is y18=9.\n\nIn the action list, we have:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} = a_8 = S\n\nTurn t_1 +1: a_9 = U\n\n...\n\nUp to Turn t_1 +10: a_{18} = S or U, but since y=9, U would keep y=9, or S.\n\nBut in the minimal sequence, we don't need to specify after reaching, but since H includes it, we must.\n\nBut in the collision, at t=18, y=9, not on freeway, safe.\n\nSimilarly, for the actions, a18 can be S.\n\nNow, for the sequence, we have 11 actions.\n\nBut in the answer format, we need to list the actions.\n\nPerhaps we can have a shorter H if we reach earlier, but we cannot.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps go to y=9 directly without intermediate, but impossible.\n\nOr, for rows 5-8, since unsafe only at t=10,11, we can be on them at t=12 or later.\n\nBut in the path above, we are on row 5 at t=14, which is fine.\n\nBut can we be on row 5 earlier? Only at t=13, but we cannot reach y=5 at t=13 without collision earlier.\n\nSimilarly, for lower rows.\n\nSo I think t=18 is the earliest possible.\n\nThus H=11.\n\nNow, the sequence:\n\nActions:\n\nAt t=8: S\n\nt=9: U\n\nt=10: U\n\nt=11: U\n\nt=12: U\n\nt=13: U\n\nt=14: U\n\nt=15: U\n\nt=16: U\n\nt=17: U\n\nThen at t=18, for the action, since we need up to t=18 for H=11, but position at t=18 is already 9, so a18 can be S.\n\nIn the sequence, for t from 0 to 10: times 8 to 18.\n\na8=S, a9=U, a10=U, a11=U, a12=U, a13=U, a14=U, a15=U, a16=U, a17=U, a18=S\n\nBut a17=U from y17=8 to y18=9.\n\na18=S at y18=9, keeps y19=9.\n\nBut position at T=18 is y18=9.\n\nIn the list, we have actions from t=8 to t=18.\n\nNow, for the answer, we need to output the actions starting from t_1=8.\n\nIn the format: Turn t_1: a_{t_1}, etc.\n\nSo for H=11, actions at t=8 to t=18.\n\nBut t=18 is t_1 + 10.\n\nNow, to write:\n\nTurn 8: S\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: S  (or U, but S is fine)\n\nBut is turn 18 included? t_1 + H -1 for the position, but actions up to t_1 + H -1? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence is for t=0 to H-1, times t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nH=11, t_1=8, so times from 8 to 8+11-1=17? t_1 + H -1 =8+11-1=18, but that is the position turn.\n\nActions at times t_1 to t_1 + H -1? No.\n\nThe actions are at times: for index t=0 to H-1, time = t_1 + t.\n\nSo for t=0, time t_1\n\nt=1, time t_1+1\n\n...\n\nt=H-1, time t_1 + H -1\n\nThen position at time t_1 + H -1 is the final position.\n\nIn this case, for time t_1 + H -1, we have an action a_{t_1 + H -1}, which determines y_{t_1 + H}, not the position at t_1 + H -1.\n\nFor example, with H=11, actions at times 8 to 8+10=18? t from 0 to 10, times 8 to 18.\n\nt=0: time 8\n\nt=1: time 9\n\n...\n\nt=10: time 18\n\nThen position at time t_1 + H -1 =8+11-1=18.\n\nAt time 18, position y18, which is set by previous actions.\n\nThen a_{18} is chosen, but y18 is already set.\n\nIn the sequence above, with a8 to a17 as U except a8=S, we have y18=9.\n\nThen a18 can be anything, S or U.\n\nIn the output, we need to include a18.\n\nSimilarly, for the collision, at t=18, y=9, safe.\n\nNow, in the action list, for turn 18, we put S.\n\nBut to minimize H, is there a way with smaller H?\n\nSuppose we reach at t=17.\n\nThen T=17, y17=9.\n\nThen 8 + H -1 =17, so H-1=9, H=10.\n\nThen actions at times t=8 to t=8+10-1=17? t from 0 to 9, times 8 to 17.\n\nPosition at t=17 should be 9.\n\nBut to have y17=9, need y16=8 with a16=U.\n\ny16=8 at t=16, row 8 safe.\n\nBut y16=8 from y15=7 with a15=U.\n\n...\n\nDown to y9=1 with a9=U, but at t=9, if y9=1, collision.\n\nIf y9=0, then y10=1 with a10=U, then y11=2, ..., y16=7, y17=8 with a16=U? y16=7, a16=U, y17=8.\n\nNot 9.\n\ny17=8, not 9.\n\nTo have y17=9, need y16=8 and a16=U.\n\ny16=8 at t=16.\n\ny16=8 from y15=7 with a15=U.\n\ny15=7 from y14=6 with a14=U.\n\n...\n\ny10=1 from y9=0 with a9=U? y9=0, a9=U, y10=1.\n\nThen y11=2, y12=3, y13=4, y14=5, y15=6, y16=7, y17=8.\n\ny17=8, not 9.\n\nIf we start from y8=0, a8=U, but y9=1 collision, impossible.\n\nSo y17 cannot be 9; the earliest is y17=8 with the delayed start, then y18=9.\n\nThus minimum T=18, H=11.\n\nSo the sequence is as above.\n\nNow for the answer.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeways 5-8, there is a car at (24,13,right,6), but we saw it never covers 0, so no issue.\n\nSimilarly, all covered.\n\nSo minimal H is 11.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 8: S\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: S  (since at t=18, y=9, we can stay)\n\nBut for the action at t=18, it is part of the sequence.\n\nIn the output, it should be for turns from t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =8+11-1=18.\n\nSo actions at turn 8 to turn 18.\n\nIn the format:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 8: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 14: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 15: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 16: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 17: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 18: S \\end{array} }\n\nSince S at t=18 is arbitrary, we could put U, but S is fine.\n\nBut to be precise, in the sequence, a18 doesn't affect the position at t=18, but we need to specify.\n\nPerhaps we can have H smaller by not including the last action, but I think we have to follow the definition.\n\nAnother thing: at t=8, we put S, but we could put D, same effect since y=0.\n\nBut S is clearer.\n\nNow, in the sequence, from t=9 to t=17, all U except first S.\n\nt=9 to t=17 is 9 actions, all U, plus a8=S and a18=S, but a17=U to go to y18=9.\n\nIn the list above, it's fine.\n\nI think this is minimal.\n\nBut let's confirm the unsafe times.\n\nFor rows 1-4: unsafe at t=8,9\n\nAt t=10: safe, as [1,12] for car B, 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, for rows 5-8: unsafe at t=10,11\n\nAt t=10: car D span [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nt=11: [-5,6], 0 included.\n\nt=12: [1,12], safe.\n\nIn the path, we are on row 1 at t=10, safe.\n\nOn row 2 at t=11, safe.\n\n...\n\nOn row 5 at t=14, safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nNo need to do anything else.\n\nSo H=11.\n\nAnswer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 8\\), while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), is 11. This is achieved by staying at \\(y = 0\\) for the first turn to avoid the unsafe condition on row \\(y = 1\\) at turn 9, then moving up consistently to reach \\(y = 9\\) by turn 18.\n\n### Explanation:\n- At turn 8, the player is at \\(y = 0\\), which is safe (not a freeway). Choosing action \\(S\\) (stay) keeps the player at \\(y = 0\\) for turn 9, avoiding collision on row \\(y = 1\\) at turn 9 (unsafe due to car coverage).\n- From turn 9 onwards, moving up (\\(U\\)) each turn reaches \\(y = 9\\) at turn 18:\n  - Turn 9: \\(y = 0 \\to y = 1\\) (safe, as row \\(y = 1\\) is unsafe only at turns 8 and 9; turn 10 is safe).\n  - Turns 10–17: Continue moving up, reaching \\(y = 9\\) at turn 18. All intermediate rows are safe at the respective turns:\n    - Rows \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 4\\) are unsafe only at turns 8 and 9; turns 10 onwards are safe.\n    - Rows \\(y = 5\\) to \\(y = 8\\) are unsafe only at turns 10 and 11; turns 12 onwards are safe.\n- At turn 18, the player is at \\(y = 9\\) (goal), and action \\(S\\) is chosen (arbitrary, as position is already reached).\n\n### Action Sequence:\nThe sequence of actions \\(\\{a_t\\}\\) for turns \\(t = 8\\) to \\(t = 18\\) (i.e., \\(t_1 + t\\) for \\(t = 0\\) to \\(10\\)) is:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 8: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 14: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 15: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 16: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 17: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 18: S \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t₁ = 9, and I start at y=0. The goal is y=9.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the car movements. All cars are moving right with speed 6. For each car, the span is given as (head, tail, direction, speed). Since they're all moving right, the head is the right end, and tail is the left end? Let me read the car update rules.\n\nFor right-moving cars: \"Span(t₁) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t₁), h + s(T-t₁)]\"\n\nIn the table, it's given as (head h, tail τ, direction, speed). But in the rule, for right-moving, it says Span(t₁) = [τ, h], so τ is tail (left) and h is head (right). That matches: tail is left, head is right for right-moving cars.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, it would be head left, tail right, but all cars here are right-moving.\n\nSo for each car, at time T, the span is [τ + s(T-t₁), h + s(T-t₁)] for right-moving cars.\n\nt₁ is 9, current turn.\n\ns is speed, all 6.\n\nNow, collision occurs at turn T if the player is on freeway y_T and 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway at that turn.\n\nThe player position is at x=0, so we care about when x=0 is covered by a car span on the row we're on.\n\nAlso, note: if we move to a different y at turn T, we are not on that new y until the next turn. So at turn T, when we take action, we are on y_T, and after move, we are on y_{T+1} for the next turn.\n\nSpecifically: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nSo at turn T, we are on y_T. We take action a_T, which changes y to y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy_T.\n\nThen at turn T, for collision, we care about cars on freeway y_T at time T.\n\nAt turn T+1, we care about cars on y_{T+1} at time T+1.\n\nNow, we start at t₁=9, y=0.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nActions: U (up +1), D (down -1), S (stay 0).\n\ny from 0 to 9, so to go from 0 to 9, we need to increase y by 9, so minimum moves, if we only go up, it would take 9 moves, but we might need to wait or go down to avoid cars, so H might be more than 9.\n\nBut since we can only move one step at a time, and we need to go up 9, the minimal H without any obstacles would be 9, but with cars, it might be more.\n\nNow, let's look at the car states.\n\nAll freeways from 1 to 8 have cars, but different numbers.\n\nSpecifically:\n\nFreeway 1: two cars: (-42, -53, right, 6) and (6, -5, right, 6)\n\nSimilarly for 2,3,4 same as 1.\n\nFreeway 5,6,7,8: three cars each: (-42, -53, right, 6), (-6, -17, right, 6), (30, 19, right, 6)\n\nFirst, for each car, let's define the span at time t, relative to t₁=9.\n\nSet τ = T - t₁, so at τ=0, current time.\n\nThen for a car with (tail τ, head h, right, s=6), at time τ (after t₁), the position is:\n\nLeft end: tail + 6τ\n\nRight end: head + 6τ\n\nSince moving right, increasing.\n\nIn the span [τ + s(T-t₁), h + s(T-t₁)], so left: τ + 6τ? T-t₁ is the time difference.\n\nSet δt = T - t₁, so at δt=0, now.\n\nThen for a car, at δt, left end: tail + 6 * δt\n\nRight end: head + 6 * δt\n\nNow, we care about when x=0 is covered, i.e., left end <= 0 <= right end.\n\nSo for a car, collision at δt if tail + 6 δt <= 0 <= head + 6 δt\n\nNow, for freeway 1, cars:\n\nCar A: tail = -53, head = -42? In the table it says (head h, tail τ), so for first car: head = -42, tail = -53? But in the rule, for right-moving, span is [τ, h] with τ tail, h head.\n\nIn the car state: \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nAnd d=right, so span [τ, h] with τ left, h right.\n\nSo for first car on freeway 1: head h = -42, tail τ = -53? -53 and -42, but -53 < -42, so left end τ = -53, right end h = -42, so span from -53 to -42, which is left of zero, since both negative.\n\nSimilarly, second car: head =6, tail= -5, so left -5, right 6, which includes 0? -5 <=0<=6? 0 is between -5 and 6? -5 <= 0 <= 6 is true, since -5 < 0 < 6.\n\n-5 to 6 includes 0.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nLet's list for each freeway, at δt=0, which cars cover x=0.\n\nFirst, freeway 1:\n\nCar 1: τ = -53, h = -42, so left = -53 + 6*0 = -53, right = -42 + 0 = -42, both negative, so 0 not in [-53,-42].\n\nCar 2: τ = -5, h = 6? \" (6, -5, right, 6)\" so head=6, tail= -5, so left = tail = -5, right = head =6.\n\nAt δt=0, left = -5, right =6, so -5 <=0<=6, yes, 0 is covered.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 2,3,4 same as 1: each has a car with tail=-5, head=6 at δt=0, so x=0 covered.\n\nNow freeway 5,6,7,8:\n\nFirst car: head=-42, tail=-53, left=-53, right=-42, both neg, no cover.\n\nSecond car: head=-6? \"(-6, -17, right, 6)\" head=-6, tail=-17? tail τ, so left=τ=-17, right=h=-6.\n\n-17 and -6, both negative, -17 < -6 <0, so 0 not in [-17,-6].\n\n-17 to -6, all negative, 0 not included.\n\nThird car: head=30, tail=19? \"(30, 19, right, 6)\" so head=30, tail=19, left=19, right=30, both positive, 19 to 30, 0 not included since 19>0.\n\nAt δt=0, for freeway 5, no car covers x=0? Let's see:\n\nCar1: [-53,-42], no\n\nCar2: tail=-17, head=-6, so [-17,-6], all negative, 0 not in\n\nCar3: tail=19, head=30, [19,30], all positive, 0 not in\n\nSo at δt=0, freeway 5 has no car at x=0.\n\nSimilarly for 6,7,8 same.\n\nBut we are at y=0 at t₁=9, and we need to go to freeways 1-8.\n\nAt the start, we are on y=0, and there are no cars on y=0, I think? The freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nThe player starts at (0,0), and we need to reach (0,9). Freeways with cars are y=1 to 8.\n\nSo y=0 and y=9 are always safe, no cars.\n\nNow, at turn T, when we are on a freeway y_T between 1 and 8, we need to ensure that at that turn, no car on that freeway covers x=0.\n\nNow, for each freeway, we need to find for which δt the freeway is safe at x=0.\n\nThat is, for a given freeway k, at time δt, is there a car covering x=0.\n\nLet's define for each freeway the times when it is unsafe.\n\nStart with freeway 1.\n\nFreeway 1 has two cars:\n\nCar A: tail τ_A = -53, head h_A = -42, s=6\n\nCar B: tail τ_B = -5, head h_B = 6, s=6\n\nFor car A: covers x=0 when τ_A + 6 δt <= 0 <= h_A + 6 δt\n\n-53 + 6δt <= 0 <= -42 + 6δt\n\nFirst inequality: -53 + 6δt <= 0 => 6δt <= 53 => δt <= 53/6 ≈ 8.833, so δt <= 8 since integer? δt is integer, turns.\n\nδt is time step, T - t₁, integer, since turns.\n\nt₁=9, T is turn number, so δt = T - t₁, integer >=0.\n\nSimilarly, actions at discrete turns.\n\nSo δt integer.\n\nCar A: -53 + 6δt <= 0 <= -42 + 6δt\n\nFirst: -53 + 6δt <= 0 => 6δt <= 53 => δt <= 53/6 = 8.833, so δt <= 8\n\nSecond: 0 <= -42 + 6δt => 42 <= 6δt => δt >= 42/6 = 7\n\nSo both: 7 <= δt <= 8\n\nSimilarly, car B: τ_B + 6δt <= 0 <= h_B + 6δt\n\nτ_B = -5, h_B =6\n\n-5 + 6δt <= 0 <= 6 + 6δt? 0 <= 6 + 6δt always true since δt >=0, 6+6δt >=6>0.\n\nAnd -5 + 6δt <= 0 => 6δt <=5 => δt <= 5/6 ≈0.833, so δt <=0 since integer.\n\nδt <=0, and δt >=0, so only at δt=0.\n\nAt δt=0, -5 +0 <=0<=6+0, -5<=0<=6 true.\n\nFor δt=1, -5+6=1 >0, so left end=1>0, so 0 not <= left end? The inequality is left <=0<=right.\n\nAt δt=1, left = τ_B +6*1 = -5+6=1, right=6+6=12, so 1 <=0<=12? 1<=0 false, so 0 not covered.\n\nSimilarly for δt>0, left even larger.\n\nSo car B covers only at δt=0.\n\nNow for freeway 1, unsafe when either car covers.\n\nCar A covers at δt=7 and 8.\n\nCar B covers at δt=0.\n\nSo freeway 1 unsafe at δt=0,7,8.\n\nδt=0 is now, but we are not on freeway 1 now, we are on y=0.\n\nNow freeway 2,3,4: same as freeway 1, since same cars. So each unsafe at δt=0,7,8.\n\nBut δt=0 is t₁, we are not on them now.\n\nNow freeway 5,6,7,8: each has three cars.\n\nCar C: head=-42, tail=-53, same as before, covers at δt=7 and 8? Let's compute.\n\nτ_C = -53, h_C = -42\n\n-53 +6δt <=0 <= -42 +6δt\n\nAs before, 7<=δt<=8.\n\nCar D: head=-6, tail=-17? \"(-6, -17, right, 6)\" so head h_D = -6, tail τ_D = -17\n\nThen cover when τ_D +6δt <=0 <= h_D +6δt\n\n-17 +6δt <=0 <= -6 +6δt\n\nFirst: -17+6δt <=0 => 6δt <=17 => δt <=17/6≈2.833, δt<=2\n\nSecond: 0 <= -6 +6δt => 6 <=6δt => δt >=1\n\nSo both: 1<=δt<=2\n\nCar E: head=30, tail=19? \"(30, 19, right, 6)\" so head=30, tail=19\n\nCover when τ_E +6δt <=0 <= h_E +6δt\n\n19 +6δt <=0 <=30 +6δt\n\nNow, 19 +6δt <=0? 19 +6δt >=19>0 for δt>=0, so left end always positive, never <=0. So 0 cannot be <= left end since left end >=19>0, so inequality false for all δt. Thus, car E never covers x=0.\n\nSimilarly for all such cars on 5-8.\n\nSo for freeway 5, unsafe when car C or car D covers.\n\nCar C: δt=7,8\n\nCar D: δt=1,2\n\nCar E never.\n\nSo unsafe at δt=1,2,7,8\n\nSimilarly for freeway 6,7,8 same.\n\nNow freeway 1-4 unsafe at δt=0,7,8\n\nBut δt=0 is now, not relevant for future, since we start from now.\n\nWe start at δt=0, y=0.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nWe must pass through y=1 to 8, each for one turn or more, but since we move one step at a time, we will be on each y from 1 to 8 at some point, unless we skip, but we can only change by ±1 or 0, so we must visit each integer y between start and end.\n\nStart y=0, end y=9, so we need to be on y=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 at some turns.\n\nFor each such turn, when we are on y_k, at that turn, it must be safe, meaning no car on that freeway covers x=0 at that time δt.\n\nδt is relative to t₁=9, so for a future turn T, δt = T - 9.\n\nNow, we need to find a sequence of actions that gets us to y=9 in minimal H, with H being the number of turns, including the starting turn? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence is from t= t₁ to t₁ + H -1, so H actions over H turns, from turn t₁ to turn t₁ + H -1.\n\nAt turn t₁, we start at y_{t₁} =0, and after H actions, at turn t₁ + H -1, we are at y_{t₁ + H -1} =9? Let's see the time.\n\nAt turn T, we are at position y_T.\n\nAfter action a_T, we move to y_{T+1}.\n\nWe start at turn t₁, y_{t₁} =0.\n\nWe take action a_{t₁}, which determines y_{t₁ +1}.\n\nThen at turn t₁ +1, we are at y_{t₁ +1}, take action a_{t₁ +1}, and so on.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t₁ + H, we are at y_{t₁ + H}, but we need to reach y=9.\n\nThe sequence is {a_{t₁ + t} for t=0 to H-1}, so actions at times t₁ to t₁ + H -1.\n\nAfter a_{t₁ + H -1}, we are at y_{t₁ + H}.\n\nAnd we want y_{t₁ + H} =9.\n\nSince we start at y_{t₁} =0, and after H actions, we are at y_{t₁ + H}.\n\nWe need y_{t₁ + H} =9.\n\nThe minimal number of up moves needed is 9, since each U increases y by 1, D decreases, S stays.\n\nTo go from 0 to 9, net change +9, so number of U minus number of D must be 9.\n\nEach S or D doesn't help, so minimal H is at least 9, with all U, but may need to insert S or D to avoid cars, increasing H.\n\nH is the number of turns, i.e., number of actions.\n\nIn H turns, we can have y increase by at most H, so to reach 9, H >=9.\n\nWith H=9, all U, y goes 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9.\n\nBut we need to check if this path is safe, i.e., for each turn from t₁ to t₁+8, when we are on y_T, it must be safe for that freeway at that time.\n\ny_T: at turn T, we are on y_T.\n\nFor T from t₁ to t₁+8, y_T = T - t₁, since we start y_{t₁}=0, and each action U, so y_{t₁ + k} = k for k=0 to 9? Let's set time.\n\nSet δt = T - t₁, so at turn t₁ + δt, we are on y_{t₁ + δt}.\n\nFor the all-U path, at time δt, we are on y = δt.\n\nWe need for each δt from 0 to 8, when on y=δt, but y=δt, and freeways are y=1 to 8 for δt=1 to 8? y=δt, so for δt=0, y=0, safe.\n\nδt=1, y=1, freeway 1\n\nδt=2, y=2, freeway 2\n\n...\n\nδt=8, y=8, freeway 8\n\nThen at δt=9, y=9, safe, but we reach at turn t₁ +9, y_{t₁+9}=9, which is after 9 actions? Let's see.\n\nStart at turn t₁, δt=0, y=0.\n\nAfter action a_{t₁} = U, at turn t₁+1, y=1.\n\nGenerally, after action at turn T, we are at y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nIn terms of when we are on a position:\n\nAt turn T, we are at position y_T.\n\nWe take action a_T, which moves us to y_{T+1} for turn T+1.\n\nSo for the all-U sequence: actions all U from t₁ to t₁+8.\n\nAt turn t₁: y=0, take U, so at turn t₁+1, y=1\n\nAt turn t₁+1: y=1, take U, so at turn t₁+2, y=2\n\n...\n\nAt turn t₁+8: y=8, take U, so at turn t₁+9, y=9.\n\nWe reach y=9 at turn t₁+9.\n\nNow, collision check: at each turn T from t₁ to t₁+8, we are on y_T.\n\nFor T = t₁ + δt, with δt from 0 to 8.\n\nAt δt=0, T=t₁, y=0, safe, no freeway.\n\nδt=1, T=t₁+1, y=1, freeway 1\n\nWe need freeway 1 safe at time δt=1? Time: at turn T, the time for car is T - t₁ = δt.\n\nSo at turn T=t₁+1, δt=1, on freeway y=1.\n\nIs freeway 1 safe at δt=1?\n\nFrom earlier, freeway 1 unsafe at δt=0,7,8.\n\nδt=1 not in {0,7,8}, so should be safe at δt=1.\n\nSimilarly, δt=2, y=2, freeway 2, unsafe at δt=0,7,8, δt=2 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly for δt=3,4, same for freeway 3,4, unsafe only at δt=0,7,8, so at δt=3,4 safe.\n\nδt=0 not possible since we start at δt=0 y=0.\n\nNow δt=5, y=5, freeway 5.\n\nFreeway 5 unsafe at δt=1,2,7,8.\n\nδt=5 not in, so safe.\n\nSimilarly δt=6, y=6, freeway 6, same, unsafe at δt=1,2,7,8, δt=6 not in, safe.\n\nδt=7, y=7, freeway 7.\n\nFreeway 7 is like 5-8, unsafe at δt=1,2,7,8.\n\nδt=7 is unsafe.\n\nAt δt=7, on y=7, freeway 7 unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, δt=8, y=8, freeway 8, unsafe at δt=8.\n\nSo on the all-U path, at turn t₁+7 (δt=7), we are on y=7, which is unsafe.\n\nSimilarly at t₁+8, y=8, unsafe.\n\nSo collision at δt=7 and δt=8.\n\nThus all-U is not possible.\n\nWe need to avoid being on y=7 and y=8 at δt=7 and δt=8.\n\nAlso, for freeways 1-4, they are unsafe at δt=7,8, but since we are on y=δt, at δt=7 we are on y=7, which is freeway 7, not 1-4.\n\nFreeway 7 is one of 5-8.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo we need to delay or something.\n\nSince y=7 and y=8 are unsafe at δt=7 and δt=8, we should not be on them at those times.\n\nSimilarly, for other freeways, but at other times they might be unsafe, but in this case, for example, freeway 1 is unsafe at δt=7,8, but at δt=7, if we were on y=1, it would be unsafe, but in the path we are on y=7.\n\nWe need to plan the path so that when we are on a freeway, it is at a safe time for that freeway.\n\nNow, the unsafe times for each freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: unsafe at δt=7,8 (and 0, but 0 irrelevant)\n\nSimilarly for 2,3,4: same, unsafe at δt=7,8\n\nFreeway 5: unsafe at δt=1,2,7,8\n\nSimilarly for 6,7,8: unsafe at δt=1,2,7,8\n\nNow, we need to be on each y from 1 to 8 at some turn, and at that turn, for the corresponding freeway, δt must not be unsafe.\n\nMoreover, since we move sequentially, the order matters.\n\nWe start at y=0 at δt=0.\n\nWe end at y=9 at some δt.\n\ny=9 is safe always.\n\nNow, the minimal H: since we must increase y by 9, H >=9.\n\nWith H=9, we need to be on each y from 1 to 8 exactly once, since we move up each time, but we can have S or D, so we might stay or go down, thus visiting some y multiple times or not at all, but since we start at 0 and end at 9, we must visit all y from 0 to 9, but 0 and 9 safe, so we need to cover y=1 to 8, each at least once.\n\nIn a path with H actions, we have H+1 positions: from y_0 to y_H, with y_0=0, y_H=9.\n\nThe values y_t for t=0 to H.\n\nWe need that for each t where 1 <= y_t <=8, the freeway y_t is safe at time δt=t.\n\nδt is the time index, t here is the step from start.\n\nSet t=0 at δt=0, position y=0.\n\nAfter k actions, at step k, we are at turn t₁ + k, position y_k.\n\nδt = k, since δt = (t₁ + k) - t₁ = k.\n\nAt step k (after k actions, at turn t₁ + k), position y_k.\n\nWe need y_k =9 for some k.\n\nStart k=0, y_0=0.\n\nAfter H actions, at k=H, y_H=9.\n\nFor each k from 0 to H, if y_k between 1 and 8, then at time δt=k, freeway y_k must be safe.\n\ny_k is the position at step k.\n\nNow, for the freeway y_k, at time δt=k, it must not be unsafe.\n\nNow, we want minimal H.\n\nSince we need to go from 0 to 9, the minimal path has no down or stay, H=9, but we saw it doesn't work because at k=7, y=7, freeway 7 unsafe at δt=7; k=8, y=8, freeway 8 unsafe at δt=8.\n\nSo we need to have at k=7, not on y=7, and at k=8, not on y=8.\n\nSimilarly, for other unsafe times.\n\nBut also, for example, freeway 5 is unsafe at δt=1 and 2, so at k=1 and k=2, we should not be on freeway 5, i.e., not on y=5.\n\nSimilarly for other freeways at their unsafe times.\n\nNow, let's list the forbidden (y,k) pairs, where if at step k we are on y, it is unsafe.\n\nFor freeway 1: unsafe at δt=7,8, so if on y=1 at k=7 or k=8, unsafe.\n\nSimilarly for y=2,3,4 at k=7 or k=8.\n\nFor freeway 5: unsafe at δt=1,2,7,8, so if on y=5 at k=1,2,7,8 unsafe.\n\nSimilarly for y=6,7,8 at k=1,2,7,8.\n\ny=7 and y=8 are in both.\n\nAlso, for freeway 7, unsafe at k=1,2,7,8, so on y=7 at k=1,2,7,8 unsafe.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nNow, we need to have a sequence y_k for k=0 to H, with y_0=0, y_H=9, and |y_{k+1} - y_k| <=1, and for each k, if 1<=y_k<=8, then (y_k,k) not forbidden as above.\n\ny_k must not be in the unsafe state at that k.\n\nTo minimize H, we should avoid delays, so probably go up as much as possible.\n\nBut we need to skip the unsafe points.\n\nFor example, at k=7 and k=8, y=7 and y=8 are unsafe, so we should not be on them.\n\nSimilarly, at k=1 and k=2, y=5,6,7,8 are unsafe if on them, but y=5,6,7,8 at k=1 or 2.\n\nSpecifically:\n\nAt k=1: if on y=5, unsafe (freeway5 unsafe)\n\nSimilarly on y=6,7,8 unsafe.\n\nBut at k=1, possible positions: from y_0=0, after one action, y_1 can be 0 (S), 1 (U), or -1? But y=0 is min, y_{k+1} = y_k + Δy, and y in [0,9], so cannot go below 0.\n\nSimilarly, cannot go above 9 immediately.\n\nSo from y=0, a_t can be S, U, or D but D would go to -1, not allowed, so only S or U.\n\nSimilarly, at y=0, only S or U.\n\nAt y=9, only S or D.\n\nBut we start at y=0.\n\nSo at k=0, y=0.\n\nAfter action, y_1: if S, y=0; if U, y=1.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, at k=1, if y_1=1, which is freeway 1, at δt=1.\n\nFreeway 1 is safe at δt=1, since unsafe only at 7,8.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2,3,4 safe at k=1.\n\nBut freeway 5,6,7,8 unsafe at k=1,2.\n\nSo at k=1, if we are on y=5,6,7,8, it would be unsafe, but from y=0, we can only be at y=0 or 1 at k=1, so y=1 is safe, y=0 safe.\n\nSimilarly at k=2, from y=1, we can be at y=0,1,2.\n\ny=2 is freeway 2, safe at k=2 since unsafe only 7,8.\n\ny=1 or 0 safe.\n\nBut y=5,6,7,8 not reachable at k=2 from start.\n\nThe earliest to reach y=5 is k=5, with all U: y_k=k.\n\nSimilarly, y=6 at k=6, etc.\n\nSo at k=1 and k=2, we cannot be on y=5,6,7,8 anyway, since too high.\n\nSimilarly, the forbidden at k=1,2 for high y are not binding because we are low.\n\nSimilarly, at k=7,8, we need to avoid being on y=7 or y=8.\n\nAlso, for freeway 1-4, at k=7,8, if on y=1,2,3,4, unsafe, but if we are on high y, we might not be on low y at late k.\n\nNow, back to the problem: at k=7 and k=8, y=7 and y=8 are unsafe, so we need to be not on them.\n\nSimilarly, y=1,2,3,4 are unsafe at k=7,8, but if we are on y=7 or 8 at k=7,8, it's already covered, but we need to avoid all unsafe positions.\n\nTo have H small, we can try to be on y=7 at a different time, or wait.\n\nSince at k=7 and 8, y=7 and 8 are bad, we can be on them earlier or later.\n\nFor example, be on y=7 before k=7 or after k=8.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9.\n\nThe unsafe times for each freeway:\n\nFor a fixed freeway, it has safe times.\n\nBut we care about when we are on it.\n\nLet's list the safe times for each freeway.\n\nFreeway 1: unsafe at k=7,8, so safe for k=1,2,3,4,5,6,9,... etc.\n\nSimilarly freeway 2,3,4: safe for k=1 to6,9,10,...\n\nFreeway 5: unsafe at k=1,2,7,8, so safe for k=3,4,5,6,9,10,...\n\nSimilarly freeway 6,7,8: safe for k=3,4,5,6,9,10,...\n\nNow, we need to assign for each y from 1 to 8, a time k when we are on it, and at that k, it is safe for that freeway.\n\nMoreover, the sequence must be connected: |y_{k+1} - y_k| <=1.\n\nSince we start at k=0 y=0, end at k=H y=9.\n\nTo minimize H, we should visit each y exactly once, in order, but with possible stays or back, but to minimize, no extra moves.\n\nWith H=9, we must go from 0 to 9 in 9 steps, so y_k = k for k=0 to9, but we have problems at k=7 and k=8.\n\ny=7 at k=7 unsafe, y=8 at k=8 unsafe.\n\nSo we need to modify the path so that at k=7, we are not on y=7, and at k=8 not on y=8.\n\nSimilarly, for other k, but other k might be ok.\n\nFor example, at k=7, we could be on y=6 or y=8 or y=7, but y=7 bad, so y=6 or y=8.\n\nBut y=8 at k=7: freeway 8 at k=7, is it safe? Freeway 8 unsafe at k=7, since δt=7, unsafe for y=8.\n\nSimilarly, y=6 at k=7: freeway 6 at k=7.\n\nFreeway 6 unsafe at k=7, since for y=6, freeway 6 unsafe at k=7.\n\nFreeway 6 is unsafe at k=7,8,1,2.\n\nSo at k=7, on y=6, unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, y=8 at k=7, unsafe.\n\nWhat about y=5 at k=7? Freeway 5 at k=7, unsafe.\n\ny=4 at k=7: freeway 4 at k=7, unsafe since freeway 4 unsafe at k=7,8.\n\nSimilarly, all y from 1 to 8 at k=7 are unsafe? Let's see.\n\nFreeway 1-4: unsafe at k=7,8\n\nFreeway 5-8: unsafe at k=7,8\n\nSo at k=7, for any y from 1 to 8, the freeway is unsafe, because all freeways are unsafe at k=7.\n\nSimilarly at k=8.\n\nAt k=7, all freeways y=1 to 8 are unsafe.\n\nTherefore, we cannot be on any freeway at k=7 or k=8.\n\nThat means at step k=7 and k=8, we must be on y=0 or y=9.\n\nSimilarly for k=8.\n\nBut y=0 and y=9 are safe, no freeway.\n\nSo we need to be at y=0 or y=9 at k=7 and k=8.\n\nBut we start at y=0, k=0.\n\nAnd we need to reach y=9 by some H.\n\nNow, at k=7 and k=8, we must be on y=0 or y=9.\n\nSince y=9 is the goal, if we reach y=9 early, we can stay, but we need to be at y=9 at k=H for the end.\n\nBut we can reach before and stay.\n\nSimilarly, we can be at y=0 at k=7 or 8.\n\nBut y=0 is start.\n\nNow, let's see the implications.\n\nFirst, we cannot be on any y=1-8 at k=7 and k=8.\n\nSo for k=7 and k=8, position must be 0 or 9.\n\nNow, since we start from y=0 at k=0, and need to go to y=9, to be at y=0 at k=7, we must have come down or stayed, but that means we wasted time, increasing H.\n\nSimilarly, to be at y=9 at k=7, we must have reached early.\n\nBut minimal H might be larger than 9.\n\nNow, also, we need to visit all y from 1 to 8 at some point, but not at k=7 or 8.\n\nNow, the safe times for freeways: for example, freeway 1 safe at k=1,2,3,4,5,6,9,...\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nNow, k=1 and 2 have restrictions for high freeways, but as before, not binding.\n\nNow, to minimize H, we should go up as fast as possible, but avoid being on 1-8 at k=7,8.\n\nSo possible: reach y=9 before k=7, or after k=8.\n\nFirst, if we reach y=9 at or before k=7, then for k=7 and 8, we can be at y=9, safe.\n\nThen we need to have visited all y from 1 to 8 before k=7.\n\nSince at k=7 we are at y=9, so we must have been at y=8 at some k<=6.\n\nSimilarly, all y visited by k=6.\n\nNow, from k=0 to k=6, we need to go from y=0 to at least y=8, since we need to be at y=9 by k=7 or earlier.\n\ny at k=6 must be at least 8? Not necessarily, but to reach y=9 by k=7, at k=6, y_6 <=8, since |increment|<=1.\n\nIf at k=6, y_6=8, then at k=7, we can go to y=9.\n\nThen at k=7, we are at y=9.\n\nSimilarly, at k=8, we can stay or whatever, but since we need to end at y=9, we can set H such that at k=H, y_H=9.\n\nNow, if we reach at k=7, y=9, then we can have actions up to k=7, but we need to be at y=9 at some k.\n\nAfter H actions, at k=H, y_H=9.\n\nIf we reach y=9 at k=7, then H=7, but we started at k=0 y=0, after 7 actions, at k=7 y=9.\n\nBut we need to have visited all y from 1 to 8 during the path.\n\nWith H=7, from y=0 to y=9 in 7 steps, we must have net +9, but with 7 actions, the position can increase by at most 7, from 0 to 7, not to 9. Contradiction.\n\nEach action U: +1, D: -1, S:0.\n\nNet change: number of U minus number of D must be 9 to go from 0 to 9.\n\nWith A actions, |net change| <= A.\n\nSo to have net +9, need at least 9 actions.\n\nThus H >=9.\n\nMinimal H is 9, but with H=9, we must have exactly 9 U and 0 D, 0 S, so y_k = k for k=0 to 9.\n\nBut at k=7, y=7, on freeway 7, unsafe.\n\nAt k=8, y=8, unsafe.\n\nAnd we cannot avoid because with only U, we must be there at those times.\n\nBut earlier we saw that at k=7 and 8, all freeways are unsafe, so even if we could be on other y, it would still be unsafe.\n\nWith S or D, we can have H>9.\n\nSo H must be at least 10 or more.\n\nNow, with H>9, we can have S or D to waste time or move back.\n\nSpecifically, we need to not be on any y=1-8 at k=7 and k=8.\n\nSo for k=7 and k=8, we must be at y=0 or y=9.\n\nSince we start at y=0 k=0, and need to go to y=9, to be at y=0 at k=7, we must have stayed or gone down, but that means we are behind.\n\nTo be at y=9 at k=7, impossible with H min 9, as above.\n\nWith H=9, max y is 9, but only at k=9, with all U.\n\nAt k=7, y<=7, etc.\n\nSo to be at y=9 at k=7, we need at least 7 U, but net to 9, so with S or D, we need more actions.\n\nFor example, to be at y=9 at k=7, we need y_7=9.\n\nSince y_0=0, in 7 steps, net change +9, but each step max +1, so impossible to have net +9 in 7 steps. Max net +7 in 7 steps.\n\nSimilarly, min net -7.\n\nSo to have y_7=9, impossible.\n\nSimilarly, earliest to reach y=9 is k=9 with all U.\n\nSimilarly, to be at y=0 at k=7, possible, but we are behind.\n\nNow, back to the requirement: at k=7 and k=8, we must be at y=0 or y=9.\n\nBut y=9 impossible before k=9, so the only possibility is to be at y=0 at k=7 and/or k=8.\n\nSimilarly, at k=8, same thing.\n\nSo for k=7 and k=8, we must be at y=0.\n\nBecause y=9 not reachable yet.\n\nThen, since at k=7 and k=8 we are at y=0, that means we have wasted some time around y=0.\n\nThen, to reach y=9, we need to go up from there, but we have to visit all y=1-8 after k=8.\n\nNow, k=8 is at δt=8.\n\nNow, for freeways, at later times, they might be safe.\n\nFor example, at k=9, freeway 1 is safe? Freeway 1 unsafe only at k=7,8, so at k=9 safe.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFreeway 5-8 unsafe at k=7,8, so at k=9 safe.\n\nSo after k=8, all freeways are safe for k>=9.\n\nk=9,10,... safe for all.\n\nNow, so we can be on any freeway at k>=9 safely.\n\nNow, to minimize H, we should be at y=0 at k=7 and k=8, then go up as fast as possible to y=9.\n\nBut we need to visit y=1 to 8 at some point, which we can do after k=8.\n\nNow, at k=8, we are at y=0.\n\nThen we need to go to y=9.\n\nFrom k=8 to some H, with y_H=9.\n\nSince we start from y=0 at k=8, and need to reach y=9, with net +9, so we need at least 9 actions from there, but k=8 is already a step, we need to go to k=H.\n\nSet the actions.\n\nWe need to define the sequence from k=0.\n\nAt k=7 and k=8, we must be at y=0.\n\nSo from k=0 to k=6, we need to go from y=0 to some state, but at k=6, since at k=7 we need to be at y=0, so from k=6 to k=7, we must go down or stay, but y=0, so if y_6=0, we can S or D, but D to -1 invalid, so S; if y_6=1, we can D to 0.\n\nSimilarly, to be at y=0 at k=8, from k=7 to k=8, similar.\n\nBut we also need to visit all y=1-8 by some k.\n\nNow, from k=0 to k=6, we can visit some y, but not all, since we are low.\n\nFor example, with 6 steps, from y=0, we can reach up to y=6 with all U, or less.\n\nBut we need to visit all 1-8, so we must visit some after k=8.\n\nNow, since at k=8 we are at y=0, then from k=8 to k=H, we go up to y=9, visiting all y=1-8 in the process.\n\nThe minimal way is to go directly up with no S or D, taking 9 steps from k=8 to k=17, with y_8=0, y_9=1, ..., y_17=9.\n\nThen H=17, since k from 0 to 17, 18 positions, 17 actions? k is the step index.\n\ny_k at step k.\n\nk=0: y=0\n\nAfter H actions, k=H: y_H=9.\n\nWith y_8=0, and y_17=9, so from k=8 to k=17, 9 steps, y from 0 to 9.\n\nBut at k=8, we are at y=0, which is good for k=8.\n\nSimilarly at k=7, y_7=0.\n\nNow, from k=0 to k=6, we need to be somewhere, but since we are at y_7=0, and we need to reach y_7=0 from y_0=0.\n\nSo from k=0 to k=6, we can move around, but we must visit all y=1-8 during the whole path.\n\nIn the first part, from k=0 to k=6, we can visit some low y, but not high y.\n\nFor example, with 6 steps, from y=0, we can reach y=6 with all U, or y=5 with one S, etc., but y=7 or 8 not reachable by k=6.\n\nMax y at k=6 is 6.\n\nSo we can visit y=1 to 6 by k=6, but not 7 and 8.\n\nThen y=7 and 8 must be visited after k=8.\n\nIn the second part, from k=8 to k=17, we visit y=0 to 9, so y=1 to 8 are covered.\n\ny=0 at k=8, then y=1 at k=9, etc., up to y=9 at k=17.\n\nSo all y=1 to 8 visited at k=9 to 16.\n\nAt these times, k>=9, all freeways safe, as we said.\n\nNow, in the first part, from k=0 to k=6, we are at y_0=0, and we need to get to y_7=0.\n\ny_7=0.\n\nFrom k=0 to k=6, we start and end at y=0, with 6 actions.\n\nWe need to visit y=1 to 6 during this period, since after k=8 we visit y=1 to 8 again, but we don't need to visit multiple times, but it's ok, we can visit early.\n\nBut to minimize H, we don't care, as long as we visit at least once.\n\nIn the second part, we will visit all, so in the first part, we don't need to visit any, we can just stay at y=0 or move around but come back.\n\nTo save actions, we can stay at y=0 for the first 7 steps.\n\nThat is, from k=0 to k=6, all actions S, so y_k=0 for k=0 to 6.\n\nThen at k=6, y=0, take action to k=7.\n\nTo be at y_7=0, we can take S or D, but D invalid, so take S.\n\nAt k=7, y=0.\n\nSimilarly, at k=7, take action to k=8.\n\nTo be at y_8=0, take S again.\n\nThen at k=8, y=0.\n\nNow, from here, we need to go to y=9.\n\nTake all U actions.\n\nAt k=8, y=0, take U, to y=1 at k=9\n\nk=9, y=1, take U, to y=2 at k=10\n\n...\n\nUp to at k=16, y=8, take U, to y=9 at k=17\n\nk=17, y=9.\n\nNow, H=17, since after 17 actions, at k=17, y=9.\n\nk from 0 to 17, that's 18 positions, 17 actions.\n\ny_0 to y_17, 18 states, 17 actions.\n\nNow, we need to check if all are safe.\n\nFirst, for k=0 to 6: y_k=0, safe, no freeway.\n\nk=7: y=0, safe\n\nk=8: y=0, safe\n\nk=9: y=1, freeway 1 at δt=9.\n\nδt=k=9.\n\nFreeway 1 safe at k=9, since unsafe only 7,8.\n\nSimilarly, k=10: y=2, freeway 2 at k=10, safe.\n\n...\n\nUp to k=16: y=8, freeway 8 at k=16.\n\nFreeway 8 unsafe at k=1,2,7,8, so at k=16 safe.\n\nk=17: y=9, safe.\n\nNow, we have visited all y=1 to 8 at k=9 to 16, all safe times.\n\nBut H=17, which is large.\n\nWe can reduce H by not staying all the time at start.\n\nFor example, we can go up to some point and come back to y=0 by k=7.\n\nBut since we need to be at y=0 at k=7 and k=8, and from k=0 to k=6, we can move, but to visit high y early might not help, because we have to come back.\n\nFor instance, suppose we go up to y=6 by k=6, then at k=6, y=6, we need to go to y=7? But at k=7 we need to be at y=0, so from y=6, we need to go down to y=0 in one step? Impossible, |change|<=1, so from y=6 at k=6, to y_7=0, cannot, since to y=5 min.\n\ny_{k+1} = y_k + Δy, |Δy|<=1, so from y_k to y_{k+1}, change by at most 1.\n\nSo if at k=6, y_6=a, then at k=7, y_7 can be a-1, a, or a+1.\n\nTo have y_7=0, we need a-1=0, so a=1, or if a=0, S.\n\nSimilarly, for y_7=0, y_6 must be 0 or 1.\n\nSimilarly, for y_8=0, y_7 must be 0 or 1, and then y_8=0.\n\nBut we need y_7=0 and y_8=0.\n\nSo y_7=0.\n\nThen y_6 must be 0 or 1.\n\nIf y_6=0, then to y_7=0, action S.\n\nIf y_6=1, then to y_7=0, action D.\n\nSimilarly, at k=7, y_7=0, then to y_8=0, action S.\n\nNow, also, to have y_7=0, y_6 must be 0 or 1.\n\nSimilarly, y_8=0.\n\nNow, from k=0 to k=6, we start y_0=0, end with y_6=0 or 1.\n\nIf y_6=0, then we can have actions to stay or move but back to 0.\n\nIf y_6=1, then at k=6 y=1.\n\nNow, to minimize H, we want to start the ascent as soon as possible, but we have to be at y=0 at k=7 and 8.\n\nIn the above, with staying, we have H=17.\n\nBut we can do better by going up a bit and coming back.\n\nFor example, suppose we go up to y=3 or something by k=3, then come back to y=0 by k=6 or so.\n\nBut we need to visit y=1-8, but we can do that in the second part.\n\nSince we visit all in the second part, we don't need to visit in the first part.\n\nTo reduce H, we can shorten the first part.\n\nThe first part from k=0 to k=6, we have 6 actions to go from y_0=0 to y_6, with y_6=0 or 1.\n\nThen from y_6 to y_7=0.\n\nThen y_7=0 to y_8=0.\n\nThen from y_8=0 to y_H=9.\n\nThe minimal for the second ascent: from y=0 to y=9, minimal 9 actions, so from k=8 to k=17, y from 0 to 9, k=17 y=9.\n\nH=17.\n\nBut y_6 must be 0 or 1.\n\nIf y_6=0, then from k=0 to k=6, with y_6=0, we can have all S, or move around but back to 0.\n\nWith all S, we use 6 actions but no progress.\n\nIf we go up to y=1 and stay or something.\n\nFor example, suppose at k=0, y=0, take U to y=1 at k=1.\n\nThen at k=1, y=1, take S or D or U.\n\nBut we need to be at y_6=0 or 1.\n\nIf we go up, we have to come down, wasting actions.\n\nFor instance, to reach y_6=1: we can go to y=1 early and stay, or go up and down.\n\nBut with net zero or little.\n\nMinimal actions to have y_6=1: for example, at k=0 U to y=1 at k=1, then stay at y=1 for k=2 to k=6 with S actions. Then y_6=1.\n\nThen at k=6, y=1, take D to y=0 at k=7.\n\nThen at k=7, y=0, take S to y=0 at k=8.\n\nThen from k=8, y=0, start going up: U to y=1 at k=9, U to y=2 at k=10, ..., U to y=9 at k=17.\n\nSame as before, H=17.\n\nIf we go higher, say to y=3 at k=3, then need to come back to y=1 or 0 by k=6.\n\nFor example, k=0: U to y=1 k=1\n\nk=1: U to y=2 k=2\n\nk=2: U to y=3 k=3\n\nThen k=3: D to y=2 k=4\n\nk=4: D to y=1 k=5\n\nk=5: S to y=1 k=6? y_6=1\n\nThen k=6: D to y=0 k=7\n\nk=7: S to y=0 k=8\n\nThen same as before, k=8 to k=17 up.\n\nBut we used more actions in the first part, but H same, since we reach y=9 at k=17 still.\n\nIn this case, from k=0 to k=5, we have actions, y_6=1.\n\nThen k=6: D to y_7=0\n\nk=7: S to y_8=0\n\nk=8: U to y_9=1\n\n...\n\nBut y_9=1, which is same as before, but we visited y=1 earlier, but not necessary.\n\nIn terms of H, we still have y_17=9.\n\nNo savings.\n\nTo save, we need to start the ascent earlier or later, but we have to be at y=0 at k=7 and 8.\n\nPerhaps we can reach y=9 after k=8, but without the long stay.\n\nAnother idea: since at k=7 and 8 we must be at y=0, and then we go up, but we can be at y=9 earlier than k=17 if we don't stay at start.\n\nBut we have to visit all y=1-8 after k=8, since not visited before.\n\nIn the first part, if we visit some y, we don't need to visit them again, so we can start from higher at k=8.\n\nFor example, suppose in the first part, we visit y=1 to 6 by k=6.\n\nThen at k=6, y_6=6 (for example)\n\nBut to have y_7=0, impossible, since from y=6, can only go to 5,6,7.\n\nCannot reach 0.\n\ny_6 must be 0 or 1 to reach y_7=0.\n\nSo y_6 <=1.\n\nSimilarly, since y_0=0, to have y_6=1, we need net +1 in 6 actions, so one more U than D, for example.\n\nBut y_6=0 or 1.\n\nIf y_6=0, we can have all S, or equal U and D, net zero.\n\nIf y_6=1, net +1.\n\nBut in any case, the highest we can be at k=6 is y=6, but only if we go up, but then y_6=6, but we need y_6=0 or 1, so if we go up, we have to come down, so we can be at y=6 at some point, but back to y=0 or 1 at k=6.\n\nFor example, go to y=3 and back, as I had, but we visit y=1,2,3, but not 4,5,6,7,8.\n\nThen after k=8, we need to visit y=4,5,6,7,8 and 9.\n\nFrom y_8=0, we go up to y=9, visiting all.\n\nBut since we missed y=4,5,6,7,8 in the first part, we visit them in the second part.\n\nIn the second part from y=0 to y=9, we visit all, so no problem.\n\nBut H is still 17.\n\nTo reduce H, we need to have the ascent include the early visited y, but since we have to start from y=0 at k=8, we have to visit all from 0 up.\n\nUnless we are at higher y at k=8, but we must be at y=0 at k=8.\n\nSo y_8=0.\n\nThen we start from 0.\n\nSo we cannot be higher.\n\nThus minimal H is 17 with the sequence: stay at y=0 for first 7 turns (k=0 to6), then at k=7 stay, k=8 stay, then go up from k=8 to k=17.\n\nBut let's list the actions.\n\nActions at turn t, which is t₁ + t for t=0 to H-1, but in terms of k.\n\nSet k = step from start, δt=k.\n\nTurn at time t₁ + k.\n\nAction at turn t₁ + k determines y_{k+1}, but in the sequence, action at turn T for T from t₁ to t₁+H-1.\n\nDefine the sequence of actions.\n\nStart at turn t₁=9, y=0.\n\nWe need actions from turn 9 to turn 9 + H -1.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn 9 + H, y=9.\n\nTurn numbers: let T be absolute turn.\n\nAt turn T, position y_T.\n\nT from t₁ to t₁ + H -1 for actions, but positions at T to t₁ + H.\n\nAt turn t₁, y=0.\n\nAfter action a_{t₁}, y_{t₁+1} = y_t + Δy.\n\nEtc.\n\nFor simplicity, set τ = T - t₁, so τ from 0 to ? for turns.\n\nAt τ=0 (turn t₁), y=0.\n\nAction a_τ at time τ.\n\nAfter action, at time τ+1, position y_{τ+1}.\n\nWe need at time S, y_S =9 for some S.\n\nThen H = S, since from τ=0 to τ=S, S actions? Let's see.\n\nAt τ=0, after 0 actions, position y_0.\n\nAfter 1 action (at τ=0), position at τ=1, y_1.\n\n...\n\nAfter H actions (at τ=0 to H-1), position at τ=H, y_H=9.\n\nSo the sequence of actions is for τ=0 to H-1.\n\nAnd we need y_H=9.\n\nAlso, for each τ, if y_τ between 1 and 8, then at time δt=τ, freeway y_τ must be safe.\n\nNow, at τ=7 and τ=8, we must not be on 1-8, so y_7 and y_8 must be 0 or 9.\n\nBut y=9 impossible at τ=7 or 8 with H min 9, so y_7=0 and y_8=0.\n\nThen y_7=0, so at τ=7, position 0.\n\ny_8=0 at τ=8.\n\nFrom y_7=0 to y_8=0, so action at τ=7 must be S.\n\nSimilarly, y_8=0.\n\nNow, y_7=0, so y_6 must be 0 or 1.\n\nIf y_6=0, action at τ=6: S to y_7=0.\n\nIf y_6=1, action at τ=6: D to y_7=0.\n\nSimilarly, for τ=8, y_8=0, action at τ=7 is S, as above.\n\nTo have y_6=0 or 1.\n\nWe can have y_τ for τ=0 to 6 with y_6=0 or 1, and y_0=0.\n\nThe minimal H is achieved when we start going up as soon as possible after τ=8.\n\nBut at τ=8, y=0, so we need to go to y=9 from there.\n\nWith 9 actions, y from 0 to 9 at τ=17.\n\nH=17 actions.\n\nTo have smaller H, we need to have visited some high y before, but we can't because we have to be at y=0 at τ=7 and 8.\n\nFor example, if we visit y=8 at τ=6, but τ=6, y=8, then at τ=7, we can only be at 7,8,9, but we need to be at 0, impossible.\n\nSimilarly, so we cannot be high at τ=6.\n\ny_6 <=1.\n\nSo the highest we can be before τ=7 is y=1 at τ=6.\n\nThen we go down to 0 at τ=7.\n\nThen stay at 0 at τ=8.\n\nThen go up.\n\nBut in this case, for the up part, we need to visit y=2 to 8, which were not visited, so we have to go through all.\n\nFrom τ=8 y=0 to τ=17 y=9, visiting y=1 at τ=9, etc.\n\nBut y=1 was visited at τ=6 if we were there, but we can visit multiple times.\n\nNo problem.\n\nBut H=17 seems inevitable.\n\nPerhaps we can reach y=9 before τ=17 by having some moves in the first part.\n\nBut in the first part, we are at low y.\n\nFor example, suppose we go to y=1 at τ=1 and stay until τ=6, then at τ=6 y=1, D to y=0 at τ=7, S to y=0 at τ=8, then U from τ=8 to τ=17.\n\nBut at τ=9, we are at y=1 again, which is fine, but we visited y=1 at τ=1 to6 and at τ=9, redundant but ok.\n\nH still 17.\n\nTo save one step, suppose we are at y=1 at τ=8.\n\nBut we need y_8=0, so cannot.\n\ny_8 must be 0.\n\nSo no.\n\nAnother idea: at τ=8, y=0, then we go up, but we can go up faster if we don't need to visit all, but we do need to visit all y=1-8.\n\nSince we visited y=1 to 6 in the first part, we don't need to visit them again in the second part.\n\nFor example, in the first part, we can visit y=1 to 6.\n\nThen at τ=8, y=0, we go directly to y=7, but we can only move to y=1 at τ=9, then to y=2 at τ=10, etc., must step through each.\n\nCannot skip.\n\nSo from y=0 at τ=8, to y=9 at τ=17, we must visit y=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 in between, even if visited before.\n\nSo no shortcut.\n\nThus minimal H is 17.\n\nBut let's confirm the car states.\n\nPerhaps for some freeways, at certain times, but in this case, after τ=8, all safe, so no issue.\n\nBut H=17 seems large, but necessary.\n\nPerhaps we can be at y=9 at τ=8, but impossible.\n\nOr, another thought: at τ=7 and τ=8, we can be at y=9 if we reach early, but impossible to reach y=9 before τ=9.\n\nMinimal τ for y=9 is 9 with all U.\n\nAt τ=9, y=9.\n\nBut at τ=7 and 8, we are at y=7 and 8, which are unsafe.\n\nIf we reach at τ=9, then at τ=7 and 8, we are on 7 and 8, unsafe.\n\nBut to not be on 1-8 at τ=7 and 8, we must be on 0 or 9, so if we can be on 9 at τ=8, but at τ=8, with 8 actions, max y=8, not 9.\n\nSo impossible.\n\nThus, the only way is to be on 0 at τ=7 and 8.\n\nSo H=17 is minimal.\n\nBut let's see if we can reduce by one.\n\nSuppose at τ=6, y_6=1.\n\nThen at τ=6, action D, to y_7=0 at τ=7.\n\nAt τ=7, action S, to y_8=0 at τ=8.\n\nAt τ=8, action U, to y_9=1 at τ=9.\n\nThen U to y_10=2, ..., U to y_17=9 at τ=17.\n\nH=17.\n\nFrom τ=0 to τ=5, we can be at y=1 with fewer actions, but still, we need to go from y_0=0 to y_6=1.\n\nFor example, at τ=0: U to y=1 at τ=1\n\nThen τ=1 to τ=5: all S, so at τ=5, y=1? Positions:\n\nAt τ=0: y=0\n\nAfter a_0: at τ=1, y_1\n\nIf a_0=U, y_1=1\n\nThen at τ=1, a_1=S, y_2=1\n\n...\n\na_5=S, y_6=1\n\nThen a_6=D, y_7=0\n\na_7=S, y_8=0\n\na_8=U, y_9=1\n\na_9=U, y_10=2\n\n...\n\na_16=U, y_17=9\n\nSo actions from τ=0 to τ=16, 17 actions, y_17=9.\n\nSame as before.\n\nIf we do nothing from τ=0 to τ=7, all S, y=0 for τ=0 to 7.\n\nThen at τ=7, a_7=S, y_8=0\n\nThen a_8=U, y_9=1\n\n...\n\na_16=U, y_17=9\n\nBut at τ=7, y_7=0, and a_7=S to y_8=0.\n\nThen a_8 to a_16 for U to 9.\n\na_8: U to y_9=1\n\n...\n\na_16: U to y_17=9\n\nSo actions from τ=0 to τ=16, 17 actions.\n\ny_0 to y_17.\n\nNow, for the sequence, we need to output the actions for turns.\n\nBut in this sequence, from τ=0 to τ=7, we can have S actions, but at τ=6, if we have S, y_7=0, etc.\n\nBut all S from 0 to 7.\n\nThen U from 8 to 16.\n\nBut τ=16 is the 16th action? Let's index.\n\nActions a_τ for τ=0 to H-1.\n\nAfter H actions, at τ=H, y_H=9.\n\nWith H=17, a_0 to a_16.\n\ny_17=9.\n\nNow, for the collision: at τ=7, y=0, safe\n\nτ=8, y=0, safe\n\nOther times, when on freeway, at τ=9 to 16, y=1 to 8, at times τ=9 to 16, all >=9, safe.\n\nτ=9 to 16, δt=9 to 16, all >8, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nBut H=17.\n\nPerhaps we can start going up after τ=8 without delay.\n\nBut at τ=8 we are at 0.\n\nAnother idea: since at τ=7 and 8 we are at 0, but at τ=6, we can be at 1, then D to 0 at τ=7.\n\nBut still.\n\nPerhaps for the freeways, at τ=7 and 8, they are unsafe, but for example, freeway 1 is unsafe only if we are on it, but at τ=7, if we are on y=1, it is unsafe, but we are not.\n\nBut in this case, we avoid being on any.\n\nBut is there a way to be on y=9 at τ=9 with H=9, but we can't because of τ=7 and 8.\n\nUnless we can skip those times, but we can't, time must be sequential.\n\nSo I think H=17 is the minimal.\n\nBut let's double-check the car states.\n\nFor freeway 5, unsafe at δt=1,2,7,8.\n\nAt δt=1,2, if we were on high y, but we are not, so no problem.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps for y=7 and 8, we can be on them at other times.\n\nFor example, in the all-U path, at τ=7, y=7 unsafe, but if we can be on y=7 at τ=6 or τ=9, safe.\n\nSimilarly for y=8 at τ=6 or τ=9.\n\nBut in the direct path, at τ=6, y=6, not 7.\n\nTo be on y=7 at τ=6, we need to be faster, but from start, at τ=6, with 6 actions, max y=6, so y=7 impossible at τ=6.\n\nSimilarly, min y=0.\n\nSo at τ=6, y<=6.\n\nSimilarly, to be on y=7 at τ=9, but τ=9 is late.\n\nBut we have to be on y=7 at some τ not 7 or 8.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nIn the path, we can have delays.\n\nFor example, suppose we go up to y=6 by τ=6 with all U.\n\ny_0=0, a0=U, y1=1, a1=U, y2=2, ..., a5=U, y6=6.\n\nAt τ=6, y=6.\n\nThen at τ=6, we need to go to y7.\n\nBut at τ=7, we must be at 0 or 9, impossible, so we must not be on 1-8 at τ=7, so y7 must be 0 or 9.\n\nBut from y6=6, y7 can be 5,6,7, all between 1-8, unsafe at τ=7.\n\nIf y7=5, freeway 5 at τ=7 unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, all unsafe.\n\nSo we cannot be at y6=6 at τ=6 because then y7 will be 5,6, or7, all unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, if y6=5, y7=4,5,6 all unsafe.\n\nOnly if y6=0 or 1, then y7 can be 0 or 1 or 2, but if y6=0, y7=0 or1; if y6=1, y7=0,1,2.\n\nThen for y7=0, if y6=0, S; if y6=1, D.\n\nThen y7=0, safe.\n\nSimilarly for y8.\n\nSo no choice, we must have low y at τ=6.\n\nThus, the minimal H is 17.\n\nSo for the sequence, we can choose to stay at y=0 for the first 8 turns or so.\n\nBut let's specify.\n\nTo make it simple, all actions S from τ=0 to τ=7, so y=0 for τ=0 to 8.\n\nAt τ=0: y=0\n\na0=S, y1=0 at τ=1\n\na1=S, y2=0 at τ=2\n\n...\n\na6=S, y7=0 at τ=7\n\na7=S, y8=0 at τ=8\n\nThen from here, all U.\n\na8=U, y9=1 at τ=9\n\na9=U, y10=2 at τ=10\n\na10=U, y11=3 at τ=11\n\na11=U, y12=4 at τ=12\n\na12=U, y13=5 at τ=13\n\na13=U, y14=6 at τ=14\n\na14=U, y15=7 at τ=15\n\na15=U, y16=8 at τ=16\n\na16=U, y17=9 at τ=17\n\nSo H=17 actions: from τ=0 to 16.\n\nNow, for the turn numbers, t₁=9.\n\nSo actions from turn 9 to turn 9+16=25.\n\nTurn t: action\n\nTurn 9: S\n\nTurn 10: S\n\n...\n\nUp to turn 16: S? Let's list.\n\nActions at turn T for T from t₁ to t₁+H-1.\n\nt₁=9, H=17, so turns from 9 to 9+16=25.\n\nAction at turn 9: a for τ=0, which is S\n\nTurn 10: a τ=1, S\n\n...\n\nTurn 15: τ=6, S (since τ=0 to 16, 17 actions)\n\nτ=0: turn 9\n\nτ=1: turn 10\n\n...\n\nτ=16: turn 25\n\nAfter a_{25}, y at turn 26=9.\n\nTurn at which we reach y=9 is turn 26.\n\nBut in terms of the sequence, we need the actions.\n\nNow, for the output, we need to write the actions for each turn.\n\nBut in this sequence, from turn 9 to 15, all S?

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,2) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. The cars are moving, so I have to consider their positions at each turn.\n\nFirst, let's understand the car movement. All cars are moving right with speed 6. The car state is given for turn t_1 = 11.\n\nFor a right-moving car, the span at time T is [τ + s(T - t_1), h + s(T - t_1)], where (h, τ, d, s) is given at t_1.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\nFor freeway 1: cars are (-30, -41, right, 6) and (18, 7, right, 6)\n\nBut head and tail: for the first one, h = -30, τ = -41? That seems odd because usually head is greater than tail for right-moving, but here h = -30, τ = -41, which is less than h? No:\n\nτ is tail, h is head. For a right-moving car, if it's moving right, head should be to the right, so h > τ.\n\nIn the first car: h = -30, τ = -41. Since -30 > -41, that means head is at -30, tail at -41, so it's from left to right? -41 to -30, which is increasing, so yes, head at -30, tail at -41.\n\nBut typically, we think of position increasing to the right, so tail at -41, head at -30, so the car occupies from x= -41 to x= -30? Let's see the span.\n\nThe span is given as (head, tail), so for right-moving, head is the right end, tail is the left end.\n\nIn the update: for right-moving, span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nAt T = t_1, it should be [τ, h], so if h and τ are given, with h > τ for right-moving.\n\nIn this case, for first car: h = -30, τ = -41, so h > τ, since -30 > -41, so at t_1, span is [τ, h] = [-41, -30]\n\nSimilarly, second car: h=18, τ=7, so [7,18]\n\nBut for freeway 1, it says (-30,-41,right,6) and (18,7,right,6), so two cars.\n\nSimilarly for other freeways.\n\nNow for freeways 5 to 8, there are three cars each: (-30,-41,right,6), (6,-5,right,6), and (42,31,right,6)\n\nLet's list the cars for each freeway.\n\nFirst, freeways 1 to 4 have two cars each: car A: h=-30, τ=-41, s=6, right; car B: h=18, τ=7, s=6, right.\n\nFor car A: at t_1=11, span = [τ, h] = [-41, -30]\n\nFor car B: [7,18]\n\nSimilarly for freeways 2,3,4.\n\nNow freeways 5,6,7,8 have three cars: car A same as above: [-41,-30], car C: (6,-5,right,6) so h=6, τ=-5, so span [-5,6]? h=6, τ=-5, since -5 < 6, so [τ,h] = [-5,6]\n\nAnd car D: (42,31,right,6), h=42, τ=31, [31,42]\n\nAnd car A: [-41,-30]\n\nSo for each of freeways 5-8, cars at: [-41,-30], [-5,6], [31,42] at t_1=11.\n\nNow, collision occurs at turn T if the player is at y_T and for that freeway, 0 is in the span of some car on that freeway at time T.\n\nPlayer position at turn T is (0, y_T), so we care about freeway y_T.\n\nAnd collision if 0 ∈ span of a car on freeway y_T at time T.\n\nAlso, note that when moving, at turn T, if you move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T, you are not on y_{T+1} at turn T, so you only care about the freeway you are currently on at each turn.\n\nThe player update: at turn t, position is (0, y_t), then action a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, with constraints.\n\nAt turn T, after action, y_{T} is the row, and you check for collision on that row at that turn.\n\nThe collision condition: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd y_T is the player's y-position at turn T.\n\nAlso, from the note: if you move at turn T to a different row, you are not on that new row until turn T+1, so at turn T, you are still on the old row for collision purposes.\n\nLet me read the note carefully:\n\n\"Note that if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nSo, at turn T, after your action, you are on row y_T for that turn. If you move up or down, y_{T+1} is different, but at turn T, you are on y_T.\n\nCollision is checked at each turn T based on y_T and the car spans on freeway y_T at time T.\n\nNow, the player starts at turn t_1=11, y=2.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\ny from 0 to 9, so freeways 1 to 8 are the ones with cars, I think y=0 and y=9 might be safe, but y=9 is the target, and no cars on y=9 probably.\n\nThe freeways with cars are y=1 to y=8, as per the problem: \"avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1,…,8\"\n\nAnd y=0 and y=9 should be safe, no cars.\n\nBut at y=9, we don't care about cars since it's the goal.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 might be safe, but we start from y=2.\n\nNow, the minimal H to go from y=2 to y=9, which is 7 steps up if no cars, but with cars, we might need to wait or something.\n\nBut we can move up, down, or stay.\n\nEach action changes y by +1, -1, or 0.\n\nFrom y=2 to y=9, minimum steps if we go up every time: 7 actions, so H=7 turns, from t=11 to t=17, y=9 at turn 17.\n\nBut we need to avoid collisions, so we have to make sure that at each turn, when we are on a freeway y=1 to 8, 0 is not in the car span for that freeway at that turn.\n\nNow, since the cars are moving, the spans change over time.\n\nLet me define the time from turn 11 onwards.\n\nSet t = 0 as turn 11 for simplicity, so current time t=0, y=2.\n\nThen at time t (turn 11+t), we need to find actions.\n\nBut the car spans depend on T - t_1, so relative to turn 11.\n\nSet τ = T - t_1, so at time step τ, which is turn 11 + τ.\n\nAt τ=0, turn 11.\n\nPlayer at y=2.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at some τ = H-1, so after H actions, from τ=0 to τ=H-1, y at τ=H-1 is 9.\n\ny_τ at time step τ.\n\nStart at τ=0, y=2.\n\nAfter action a_0, y_1, and so on, up to y_H at τ=H, but we need y at turn when we reach, so after H actions, at time τ=H, y_H should be 9.\n\nDefine:\n\nAt time τ (τ=0,1,2,...), turn is 11+τ.\n\nPosition y_τ at time τ.\n\nAction a_τ is taken at time τ, determines y_{τ+1}.\n\ny_{τ+1} = y_τ + Δy_τ, with Δy from action.\n\nThen, at each time τ, we have y_τ, and we check collision: if y_τ between 1 and 8, and 0 in span of some car on freeway y_τ at time τ.\n\nTime τ corresponds to turn 11+τ, so T = 11+τ, t_1=11, so T - t_1 = τ.\n\nSo for a car, span at time τ is:\n\nFor right-moving: [τ + s * τ, h + s * τ]? s * (T - t_1) = s * τ.\n\nT - t_1 = τ.\n\nSo span at time τ: [τ + s τ, h + s τ] for right-moving? No.\n\nFrom earlier: for right-moving, span(T) = [τ + s (T-t_1), h + s (T-t_1)]\n\nAt time τ, T-t_1 = τ, so span(τ) = [τ + s τ, h + s τ]\n\nBut τ is the tail position at t_1, not to confuse with time.\n\nI should use different variable.\n\nLet me denote the tail and head at t_1.\n\nFor a car, let tail_0 be tail at t_1, head_0 head at t_1, speed s.\n\nThen at time τ (elapsed from t_1), for right-moving car, span(τ) = [tail_0 + s τ, head_0 + s τ]\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but all cars here are right-moving.\n\nIn this case, all cars are right-moving with speed 6.\n\ns=6 for all.\n\nNow for each freeway, the cars:\n\nFirst, freeway 1 (y=1): two cars\n\nCar A: tail_0 = -41, head_0 = -30, s=6\n\nCar B: tail_0 = 7, head_0 = 18, s=6? In the table, for freeway 1: (-30,-41,right,6) and (18,7,right,6)\n\nSo for first: head_0 = -30, tail_0 = -41\n\nSo span at τ: [tail_0 + 6τ, head_0 + 6τ] = [-41 + 6τ, -30 + 6τ]\n\nSimilarly, second car: head_0=18, tail_0=7, span [7 + 6τ, 18 + 6τ]\n\nSimilarly for freeways 2,3,4: same as freeway 1.\n\nFreeway 2,3,4 have the same cars: (-30,-41,right,6) and (18,7,right,6)\n\nNow freeways 5,6,7,8: three cars each.\n\nCar A: same as above: [-41 + 6τ, -30 + 6τ]\n\nCar C: (6,-5,right,6) so head_0=6, tail_0=-5, span [-5 + 6τ, 6 + 6τ]\n\nCar D: (42,31,right,6) head_0=42, tail_0=31, span [31 + 6τ, 42 + 6τ]\n\nCollision on freeway k at time τ if 0 is in any of the spans for that freeway.\n\nThat is, for some car, min of span <= 0 <= max of span.\n\nSince spans are intervals.\n\nNow, we need to find a sequence of actions to go from y=2 at τ=0 to y=9 at some τ=H, with no collision at each τ for y_τ in 1-8.\n\nMinimal H.\n\nFirst, since we start at y=2, and need to go to y=9, we must go through y=3,4,5,6,7,8.\n\nBut we can stay or go down to avoid, but since we need to go up, probably better to go up when possible.\n\nNow, the critical point is when we are on a row where 0 is in a car span at that time.\n\nWe need to see for each row, at what times it is safe, i.e., 0 not in any car span.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway k, the times τ when it is unsafe, i.e., collision possible.\n\nSince all freeways 1-4 are identical, and 5-8 are identical, except k different, but the car positions are the same for each group.\n\nFreeways 1 to 4 all have the same car configuration, so the safety is the same for all.\n\nSimilarly, freeways 5 to 8 all have the same.\n\nAnd freeway k is just the row number.\n\nSo for rows 1-4, the car spans are identical.\n\nSimilarly rows 5-8.\n\nNow, for a given row, it is safe at time τ if 0 not in any car span on that row.\n\nFirst, consider rows 1-4 (since same).\n\nCars: car A: span [ -41 + 6τ, -30 + 6τ ]\n\ncar B: [7 + 6τ, 18 + 6τ]\n\nNow, 0 in car A span if -41 + 6τ <= 0 <= -30 + 6τ\n\nSimilarly, 0 in car B if 7 + 6τ <= 0 <= 18 + 6τ\n\nBut 7 + 6τ <= 0 is impossible since τ >=0, 7+6τ >=7>0, so 0 <= 7+6τ is true, but 0 <= 18+6τ true, but 7+6τ <=0 false, so 0 is never in car B span because min is 7+6τ >=7>0.\n\nSimilarly, for car A: -41 + 6τ <= 0 <= -30 + 6τ\n\nSince -41 + 6τ <= 0 implies 6τ <= 41, τ <= 41/6 ≈ 6.833, so τ <=6\n\nAnd 0 <= -30 + 6τ implies 6τ >=30, τ >=5\n\nSo for car A, 0 in span when τ >=5 and τ <=6, since τ integer.\n\nτ integer, time steps.\n\nτ >=5 and τ <=6, so τ=5 or 6.\n\nAt τ=5: car A span: [-41+30, -30+30] = [-11, 0]\n\n-41 +6*5 = -41+30= -11, -30+30=0, so [ -11, 0 ], so 0 is included, since head at 0.\n\nAt τ=6: [-41+36, -30+36] = [-5,6], so 0 is in [-5,6].\n\nAt τ=7: [-41+42, -30+42] = [1,12], min=1>0, so 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, car B: min=7+6τ >=7>0, so 0 never in.\n\nSo for rows 1-4, unsafe only when τ=5 or 6.\n\nAt τ=5 or 6, if on row 1-4, collision.\n\nNow for rows 5-8.\n\nCars: car A: same [ -41 +6τ, -30 +6τ ]\n\ncar C: [ -5 +6τ, 6 +6τ ]  // since tail_0=-5, head_0=6\n\ncar D: [31 +6τ, 42 +6τ]\n\nNow, 0 in car A: as before, only when τ=5 or 6.\n\nAt τ=5: [-11,0], 0 in; τ=6: [-5,6], 0 in.\n\n0 in car C: -5 +6τ <= 0 <= 6 +6τ\n\n-5 +6τ <=0 implies 6τ <=5, τ <=5/6≈0.833, so for τ=0, possible.\n\nAt τ=0: -5 +0 = -5 <=0, 6+0=6>=0, so 0 in [ -5,6]\n\nAt τ=1: -5+6=1, 6+6=12, [1,12], 1>0, not include 0.\n\nSimilarly for τ>0, min >=1>0, not include.\n\nSo car C unsafe only at τ=0.\n\n0 in car D: 31+6τ <=0? 31+6τ >=31>0, so min >0, never include 0.\n\nSo for rows 5-8, unsafe when:\n\n- car A unsafe at τ=5,6\n\n- car C unsafe at τ=0\n\n- car D always safe\n\nSo overall, for rows 5-8:\n\nAt τ=0: unsafe due to car C\n\nAt τ=5: unsafe due to car A\n\nAt τ=6: unsafe due to car A\n\nAt other τ, safe.\n\nτ=0,5,6 unsafe.\n\nNow, we start at τ=0, y=2.\n\ny=2 is row 2, which is in 1-4, so rows 1-4.\n\nAt τ=0, for rows 1-4, is it safe?\n\nFor rows 1-4, at τ=0, car A: [-41,-30], both <0, 0 not in.\n\ncar B: [7,18]>0, not in.\n\nSo safe at τ=0 for rows 1-4.\n\nSimilarly, rows 5-8 unsafe at τ=0.\n\nBut we are at y=2, row 2, at τ=0, safe.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\ny=9 has no cars, so always safe, but we need to be at y=9 at some turn.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 safe, no cars.\n\nNow, path from y=2 to y=9.\n\nPossible actions: U, D, S.\n\nSince we need to go up, and time matters because of car movements.\n\nMinimal steps: if we go up every time, from y=2 to y=9, 7 steps: at τ=0, y=2; after 7 ups, at τ=7, y=9.\n\nBut we need to check for each step if collision.\n\ny_τ at time τ.\n\nAt τ=0: y=2, row 2, safe as above.\n\nAction a_0: if U, then y1=3; if D, y1=1; if S, y1=2.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nIf we go up each time:\n\nSequence:\n\nτ=0: y=2, action U, then y1=3\n\nBut collision at τ depends on y_τ.\n\nAt time τ, before action, we are at y_τ, then we do action to go to y_{τ+1}.\n\nBut collision is based on y_τ at time τ.\n\nSo for the sequence:\n\nStart τ=0: y_0=2\n\nAt time τ=0, y=2, which is row 2, safe (as rows 1-4 safe at τ=0 except later unsafe times, but at τ=0 safe).\n\nThen we take action a_0.\n\nSuppose a_0 = U, then y1=3\n\nNow at τ=1: y1=3\n\nTime τ=1, y=3, row 3, which is 1-4.\n\nAt τ=1, for rows 1-4: car A span: [-41+6= -35, -30+6= -24] <0, not 0.\n\ncar B: [7+6=13,18+6=24]>0, not 0. So safe.\n\nThen action a1=U, y2=4\n\nτ=2: y=4, row 4, similar, safe.\n\nAction a2=U, y3=5\n\nτ=3: y=5, row 5, which is rows 5-8.\n\nAt τ=3, for rows 5-8: we said safe except τ=0,5,6.\n\nτ=3, not 0,5,6, so safe.\n\nAction a3=U, y4=6\n\nτ=4: y=6, row 6, rows 5-8, τ=4, safe.\n\nAction a4=U, y5=7\n\nτ=5: y=7, row 7, rows 5-8.\n\nAt τ=5, for rows 5-8: unsafe, as we said.\n\nBecause car A at τ=5: span [-41+30, -30+30] = [-11,0], so 0 in span, collision.\n\nThus, if we are on row 5-8 at τ=5, collision.\n\nHere y=7 at τ=5, collision.\n\nSo we cannot be on rows 5-8 at τ=5.\n\nSimilarly, at τ=6, same issue.\n\nIn the direct up path, at τ=5, we would be at y=7 if we went up each time from τ=0.\n\ny at τ:\n\nτ=0: y=2\n\na0=U, y1=3 at τ=1\n\ny2=4 at τ=2\n\ny3=5 at τ=3\n\ny4=6 at τ=4\n\ny5=7 at τ=5 → collision\n\nSo need to avoid being on rows 5-8 at τ=5 or τ=6.\n\nAlso, rows 1-4 unsafe at τ=5 and τ=6.\n\nAt τ=5 and τ=6, all rows 1-8 are unsafe? Rows 1-4 unsafe at τ=5,6; rows 5-8 also unsafe at τ=5,6.\n\nAt τ=5: rows 1-4 unsafe because car A, rows 5-8 unsafe because car A.\n\nSimilarly τ=6.\n\nAt other times, safe except rows 5-8 at τ=0 unsafe.\n\nBut at τ=0, we start at y=2, which is row 2, rows 1-4, safe at τ=0.\n\nNow, we need to reach y=9.\n\ny=9 is safe at all times.\n\nBut to reach there, we need to pass through the rows.\n\nSince at τ=5 and τ=6, all rows 1-8 are unsafe, we must not be on any of these rows at time τ=5 or τ=6.\n\nThat means at time τ=5, we must be at y=0 or y=9 or between, but y=0 or y=9 only, since rows 1-8 all unsafe.\n\nSimilarly at τ=6.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe.\n\nBut we start from y=2, need to go to y=9.\n\nNow, minimal time: we can try to be at y=9 before τ=5 or after τ=6.\n\nBut to reach y=9 from y=2, minimum 7 steps, so at least τ=7 to be at y=9 if we start at τ=0.\n\ny at τ=0 is 2, after k actions, at τ=k, y_k.\n\nTo have y_k=9, need at least 7 actions if all up, so k=7, y_7=9.\n\nAt τ=7.\n\nSimilarly, we can reach earlier if we go up faster, but we can only change by 1 per step, so minimum 7 steps to go from 2 to 9.\n\nSo earliest possible at τ=7, y=9.\n\nBut at τ=7, we can be at y=9.\n\nNow, we need to avoid being on rows 1-8 at τ=5 and τ=6, since unsafe.\n\nAlso, at other times, we need to be safe when on those rows.\n\nSpecifically, at τ=0, rows 5-8 unsafe, but we are not on them yet.\n\nNow, let's plan the path.\n\nWe start at τ=0, y=2, safe.\n\nWe need to be at y=9 at τ=7 for minimal time.\n\nBut at τ=5 and τ=6, we must not be on rows 1-8, so must be at y=0 or y=9.\n\nBut y=9 at τ=7, so at τ=5 and τ=6, we cannot be at y=9 yet, so must be at y=0.\n\nSimilarly, we can be at y=0 at those times.\n\ny=0 is safe.\n\nSo, we need to be at y=0 at τ=5 and τ=6? Or at least not on 1-8.\n\nBut we can be at y=0.\n\nNow, from y=2 to y=0, then to y=9.\n\nBut going down to 0 might take extra steps.\n\nLet's see the timeline.\n\nWe need to ensure that at each τ, when on y=1-8, it is not an unsafe time for that row.\n\nBut since unsafe times are global for the rows, except rows 5-8 have τ=0 unsafe, but we start at y=2.\n\nList of unsafe times:\n\n- For all rows 1-8: unsafe at τ=5 and τ=6\n\n- Additionally, for rows 5-8: unsafe at τ=0\n\nAt other times, safe.\n\nNow, we start at τ=0, y=2: row 2, which is 1-4, and at τ=0, safe for 1-4, so ok.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at some τ, minimal.\n\nSince min steps 7, τ=7 possible if we can avoid collision at τ=5 and τ=6.\n\nBut at τ=5 and τ=6, we must be at y=0 or y=9.\n\nBut at τ=7, y=9, so at τ=5 and τ=6, we are not at 9, so must be at y=0.\n\nSo, we need to be at y=0 at τ=5 and τ=6.\n\nThen from there go to y=9.\n\nBut from y=2 to y=0, it takes 2 steps down, then from y=0 to y=9, 9 steps up, but that would be more than 7.\n\ny from 2 to 0: need to go down twice, so at τ=2, y=0 if we go down twice.\n\nThen from τ=2, y=0, to y=9, need 9 steps up, so at τ=11, y=9.\n\nBut we can reach earlier.\n\nSince at τ=5 and τ=6 we need to be at y=0, we can go to y=0 before and stay, or go down later.\n\nBut minimal time to reach y=9.\n\nWe can be at y=9 as early as τ=7 if we go directly, but we need to skip τ=5 and τ=6 on the way.\n\nBut since we must pass through the rows, we might need to delay or advance the crossing.\n\nAnother idea: at τ=5 and τ=6, be at y=0, then after that go up.\n\nBut we need to get to y=0 by τ=5.\n\nStart at τ=0, y=2.\n\nWe can go down to y=0 quickly.\n\nFor example:\n\nAt τ=0: y=2, safe, action D, to y=1\n\ny_{τ+1} after action.\n\nAt time τ=0, y=2, action a0, then y1 = y0 + Δy\n\nThen at time τ=1, we are at y1.\n\nCollision at τ=1 based on y1.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSequence:\n\nτ=0: position y=2, safe (as row 2 at τ=0 safe)\n\nAction: suppose we do D, to go down.\n\na0 = D, then y1 = 2 + (-1) =1? y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\n\nΔy_t: U: +1, D: -1, S:0\n\nSo after action a_t, y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\n\nAt time τ, we have position y_τ.\n\nAfter action a_τ, y_{τ+1} = y_τ + Δy_τ\n\nThen at time τ+1, position y_{τ+1}, and so on.\n\nCollision at time τ is based on y_τ.\n\nSo for τ=0: y_0=2, which is row 2, and at τ=0, safe for row 2.\n\nAction a0: if D, then y1 = 2 -1 =1\n\nThen at τ=1: y1=1, row 1, which is 1-4.\n\nAt τ=1, for rows 1-4: as before, safe, since τ=1 not 5 or 6.\n\ncar A at τ=1: [-41+6, -30+6] = [-35,-24] <0, not 0; car B [13,24]>0, not 0. Safe.\n\nIf we do S, y1=2, etc.\n\nBut we want to go to y=0 for τ=5 and 6.\n\nFirst, let's list the times when we need to be safe.\n\nWe need for all τ, if y_τ in 1-8, then not unsafe time for that row.\n\nUnsafe times: τ=5 and τ=6 for all rows 1-8.\n\nAlso τ=0 for rows 5-8.\n\nSince we start at y=2 not 5-8, and τ=0, ok.\n\nNow, to reach y=9 at τ=7.\n\ny_7=9.\n\nNow, the path must have y_τ for τ=0 to 6.\n\nAt τ=5 and τ=6, y_τ must not be in 1-8, so y_5 and y_6 must be 0 or 9.\n\nBut at τ=6, y=9 not yet, so y_5=0 and y_6=0.\n\nThen at τ=7, y_7=9.\n\nNow, from start, we need to get to y=0 by τ=5.\n\nStart at τ=0, y=2.\n\nTo y=0, we need to go down 2 steps.\n\nBut we can do it at different times.\n\nFor example, we can go down immediately.\n\nAt τ=0: y=2, action D, y1=1\n\nτ=1: y=1, action D, y2=0\n\nThen at τ=2, y=0\n\nNow, we need to be at y=0 at τ=5 and τ=6, so from τ=2 to τ=5, we can stay at y=0.\n\nActions: at τ=2, y=0, action S, y3=0\n\nτ=3, y=0, action S, y4=0\n\nτ=4, y=0, action S, y5=0\n\nτ=5: y=0, which is safe, since not on freeway 1-8.\n\nAction: now we need to go to y=9.\n\nBut at τ=5, y=0, safe.\n\nThen we can start going up.\n\nBut at τ=6, we need y_6=0, so we must stay or go down, but we need to go up later.\n\ny_6 must be 0.\n\nSo at τ=5, y=0, if we do S, then y6=0\n\nThen at τ=6, y=0, safe.\n\nThen from there, to y=9, need 9 steps up.\n\nAfter τ=6, y6=0, then a6=U, y7=1\n\nτ=7: y=1, which is row 1.\n\nAt τ=7, is row 1 safe?\n\nFor rows 1-4, at τ=7: car A span [-41+42, -30+42] = [1,12], min=1>0, not 0.\n\ncar B [7+42,18+42]= [49,60]>0, not 0. So safe.\n\nThen we can go up each step.\n\nBut from y6=0 at τ=6 to y=9, it takes 9 actions, so at τ=15, y=9.\n\ny at τ=6: y6=0\n\nAfter a6=U, y7=1 at τ=7\n\na7=U, y8=2 at τ=8\n\n...\n\nup to y15=9 at τ=15.\n\nBut we can reach faster.\n\nSince we only need to be at y=0 at τ=5 and τ=6, we can be at other rows at other times.\n\nFor example, from start, we can go up to some point, then down to 0 for τ=5 and 6, then up to 9.\n\nBut going down takes time.\n\nMinimal time to reach y=9 is 7 steps, but with constraint at τ=5 and 6.\n\nAt τ=7, y=9 is possible if we can be at y=9 at τ=7.\n\nBut to have y_7=9, we need to have started from y=2 and gone up 7 times, so y_0=2, y1=3, y2=4, y3=5, y4=6, y5=7, y6=8, y7=9.\n\nBut at τ=5, y=7, which is row 7, and τ=5, unsafe, collision.\n\nSimilarly at τ=6, y=8, row 8, unsafe.\n\nSo we cannot have that path.\n\nWe need to modify so that at τ=5 and τ=6, we are not at rows 1-8.\n\nSo for example, at τ=5, we are at y=0, but in the direct path, at τ=5, we are at y=7 if we went up all the way from start.\n\nBut we can go down at some point to reach y=0 at τ=5.\n\nSimilarly, we need to reach y=9 with minimal delay.\n\nLet me define the position over time.\n\nLet y_τ be the position at time τ.\n\nWe need y_0 = 2\n\ny_H = 9 for some H.\n\nMinimal H.\n\nAnd for each τ, if y_τ in {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}, then it must be safe, i.e., not (τ=5 or τ=6) and for rows 5-8 not τ=0.\n\nBut since τ=0 we start at 2, ok.\n\nThe only unsafe times are τ=5,6 for all 1-8, and τ=0 for 5-8.\n\nTo have y_H=9 with minimal H, H=7 is possible only if we avoid being on 1-8 at τ=5 and τ=6.\n\nBut in the sequence for H=7, we are on 1-8 at τ=5 and τ=6, specifically at high rows.\n\nSo we need to be at y=0 or y=9 at τ=5 and τ=6.\n\nSince y=9 at τ=7, we can't be at y=9 at τ=5 or 6, so must be at y=0.\n\nSo y_5 = 0 and y_6 = 0.\n\nThen from y_6=0, to y=9, it takes at least 9 steps, so y_{6+9} = y_15 =9, so H=15.\n\nBut we can do better if we are at a higher position before τ=5.\n\nFor example, suppose we go up to y=4 or something, then down to 0 for τ=5 and 6, then up to 9.\n\nBut let's calculate the time.\n\nSuppose we go up as much as possible before, then down to 0.\n\nStart τ=0, y0=2, safe.\n\nAction U, y1=3\n\nτ=1, y1=3, safe (row 3, τ=1 safe)\n\nAction U, y2=4\n\nτ=2, y2=4, safe\n\nNow, from here, we need to get to y=0 by τ=5.\n\nAt τ=2, y=4.\n\nTo y=0, need to go down 4 steps.\n\nBut we have from τ=2 to τ=5: that is, at τ=3,4,5 we can move.\n\ny at τ=3,4,5.\n\nWe need y_5=0.\n\nFrom y2=4 at τ=2.\n\nActions:\n\nAt τ=2, action, to set y3.\n\nIf we do D, y3=3\n\nThen τ=3, y=3\n\nIf D, y4=2\n\nτ=4, y=2\n\nIf D, y5=1\n\nτ=5, y=1, which is row 1, and τ=5, unsafe! Collision.\n\nNot good.\n\nIf from y2=4, do D, y3=3\n\nThen at τ=3, y=3, action S, y4=3\n\nThen action D, y5=2, still at row 2, τ=5 unsafe.\n\nWorse.\n\nTo reach y=0 by τ=5.\n\nFrom y2=4 at τ=2, we need to decrease y to 0 in 3 steps: from τ=2 to τ=5, we have actions at τ=2,3,4 to set y3,y4,y5.\n\ny5 is position at time τ=5.\n\nAfter actions at τ=2,3,4.\n\nAfter action at τ=4, y5 is set.\n\nThe actions: at τ=2, action a2, then y3 = y2 + Δy2\n\nAt τ=3, action a3, y4 = y3 + Δy3\n\nAt τ=4, action a4, y5 = y4 + Δy4\n\nWe need y5=0.\n\ny2=4.\n\nSo we need to go down 4 steps in 3 actions? Each action down decreases y by 1, so to go from 4 to 0, need 4 down actions, but we have only 3 actions: at τ=2,3,4 to affect y3,y4,y5.\n\ny2=4 at τ=2\n\nAfter a2, y3 = y2 + Δy2\n\nIf Δy2 = -1, y3=3\n\nThen after a3, y4 = y3 + Δy3\n\nIf Δy3 = -1, y4=2\n\nAfter a4, y5 = y4 + Δy4\n\nIf Δy4 = -1, y5=1\n\nOr if Δy4 = -1, y5=1, not 0.\n\nTo reach y=0, we need to have y4 such that after down, y5=0.\n\nIf y4=1, then a4=D, y5=0.\n\nBut y4=1, at time τ=4.\n\ny4 at τ=4.\n\nSimilarly, to have y5=0, we need y4=1 and a4=D, or y4=0 and a4=S or something.\n\nBut y5=0.\n\nFrom y2=4, with 3 actions, we can reach y5=0,1,2,3,4 depending on actions.\n\nFor example:\n\n- If all down: a2=D, y3=3; a3=D, y4=2; a4=D, y5=1\n\ny5=1\n\n- If a2=D, y3=3; a3=D, y4=2; a4=S, y5=2\n\n- a2=D, y3=3; a3=S, y4=3; a4=D, y5=2\n\n etc.\n\nCan we get y5=0?\n\nOnly if at some point we are at y=1 and go down, but y5 is set after a4.\n\nIf y4=1 and a4=D, then y5=0.\n\nBut y4=1 at τ=4.\n\nHow to get y4=1 from y2=4.\n\nWith two actions: at τ=2 and τ=3 to set y3 and y4.\n\ny2=4\n\na2: if D, y3=3\n\na3: if D, y4=2\n\nOr a3=S, y4=3\n\nOr a3=U, y4=4\n\nCannot get y4=1.\n\nIf a2=S, y3=4; then a3=D, y4=3; still not 1.\n\nNo way to get to y=1 with two actions from y=4; minimum y=2 if two downs, but y=2.\n\nFrom y=4, after one down, y=3; after two downs, y=2.\n\nCannot reach y=1 in two steps.\n\nSimilarly, cannot reach y=0.\n\nSo from y2=4, with actions at τ=2 and τ=3, we can get y4 to 2,3,4.\n\nThen with a4, y5 to 1,2,3,4 or if y4=2, a4=D, y5=1; a4=S, y5=2; etc.\n\nSo y5 can be 1,2,3,4, but not 0.\n\nWe cannot reach y=0 at τ=5 from y2=4 at τ=2.\n\nSimilarly, if we start higher, it's worse.\n\nAt τ=0, y=2.\n\nTo reach y=0 at τ=5.\n\ny5=0.\n\nNumber of steps from τ=0 to τ=5: 5 actions to go from y0 to y5.\n\ny0=2, y5=0, so net change -2.\n\nEach down action -1, up +1, stay 0.\n\nTo go from 2 to 0, net change -2, so we need two more down actions than up actions in the 5 actions.\n\nBut we also have the position at each step.\n\ny1 to y4 must be between 0 and 9.\n\nSince we need to be at y=0 at τ=5, and it takes time to go down.\n\nFor example, we can go down immediately.\n\nAt τ=0: y=2, action D, y1=1\n\nτ=1: y=1, action D, y2=0\n\nThen at τ=2, y=0\n\nThen we can stay at y=0 until τ=5.\n\nActions: at τ=2, y=0, action S, y3=0\n\nτ=3, y=0, action S, y4=0\n\nτ=4, y=0, action S, y5=0\n\nτ=5: y=0, good.\n\nSimilarly, at τ=5, action S, y6=0\n\nτ=6: y=0, good.\n\nThen from here, to go to y=9.\n\ny6=0\n\nAction at τ=6, a6, to y7.\n\nWe can go up.\n\na6=U, y7=1\n\nBut at τ=7, y7=1, row 1, and τ=7, which is after 6, so safe, as we saw.\n\nThen a7=U, y8=2\n\nτ=8, y=2, safe\n\na8=U, y9=3\n\nτ=9, y=3, safe\n\na9=U, y10=4\n\nτ=10, y=4, safe\n\na10=U, y11=5\n\nτ=11, y=5, row 5, which is 5-8, at τ=11.\n\nFor rows 5-8, unsafe only at τ=0,5,6.\n\nτ=11, not those, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, a11=U, y12=6\n\nτ=12, y=6, safe\n\na12=U, y13=7\n\nτ=13, y=7, safe\n\na13=U, y14=8\n\nτ=14, y=8, safe\n\na14=U, y15=9\n\nτ=15, y=9, reached.\n\nH=15, from τ=0 to τ=15, 15 actions.\n\nBut this is slow.\n\nWe can go faster by not going down all the way early.\n\nSince rows 5-8 are safe at τ=1,2,3,4,7,8,... except τ=0,5,6.\n\nτ=0,5,6 unsafe for 5-8.\n\nSimilarly for 1-4, safe except τ=5,6.\n\nWe can be on rows 3 or 4 at early times, then go down to 0 for τ=5,6, then go up.\n\nBut from high position, going down to 0 takes time.\n\nFor example, suppose we go up to y=4 by τ=2.\n\nAt τ=0: y=2, a0=U, y1=3\n\nτ=1: y=3, a1=U, y2=4\n\nτ=2: y=4\n\nNow from here, we need to be at y=0 at τ=5.\n\nAs before, we cannot reach y=0 at τ=5 from y=4 at τ=2 with 3 actions; best we can do is y5=1 as earlier.\n\nThen at τ=5, y=1, which is unsafe.\n\nNot good.\n\nGo up to y=3 at τ=1, then down.\n\nτ=0: y=2, a0=U, y1=3\n\nτ=1: y=3\n\nThen from y=3 at τ=1, to y=0 at τ=5.\n\nWith actions at τ=1,2,3,4 to set y2,y3,y4,y5.\n\ny1=3\n\na1: action, to y2\n\nIf a1=D, y2=2\n\nτ=2: y=2\n\na2=D, y3=1\n\nτ=3: y=1\n\na3=D, y4=0\n\nτ=4: y=0\n\nThen at τ=4, y=0, action a4, to y5.\n\nIf a4=S, y5=0\n\nThen τ=5: y=0, good.\n\nSimilarly, then a5=S, y6=0\n\nτ=6: y=0\n\nThen from y6=0, go up to 9, as before, to y15=9.\n\nSame as before, H=15.\n\nFrom y4=0 at τ=4, we can start going up earlier, but at τ=4, y=0, we can do a4=U, y5=1\n\nBut at τ=5, y=1, which is unsafe, collision.\n\nCannot, because at τ=5, we need to be at y=0 or 9.\n\nSo we must stay at y=0 at τ=5.\n\nSimilarly at τ=6.\n\nSo from τ=4 to τ=5, if y4=0, we must do S to stay at 0 for τ=5.\n\nSimilarly for τ=6.\n\nSo no gain.\n\nPerhaps we can be at y=9 before τ=5, but impossible from y=2 in less than 7 steps.\n\n2 to 9 is 7 steps, so at τ=7 earliest.\n\nBut at τ=5 and 6, we are on the way.\n\nAnother idea: since at τ=0, rows 5-8 are unsafe, but we are not on them.\n\nWe can go to rows 5-8 at τ=1,2,3,4,7,etc when safe.\n\nFor example, to reach y=9 at τ=7, we need to be at high y at early τ.\n\nBut at τ=5 and 6, we must not be on 1-8, so we must be at y=0 at those times.\n\nSo the only way is to be at y=0 at τ=5 and 6, then go up.\n\nBut that takes many steps.\n\nPerhaps we can reach y=9 later but with less total time by not going down as much.\n\nMinimal H is 15 in this case? But let's see if we can do better.\n\nSuppose we don't go to y=0 at τ=5 and 6, but at τ=5 and 6, we are not on the rows, so for example, if we are at y=9 at τ=6, but we can't, since min τ=7 for y=9.\n\nOr at y=0.\n\nBut y=0 at τ=5 and 6.\n\nThen from there up.\n\nBut to minimize H, we can go up as fast as possible except for the down to reach 0 at the right time.\n\nBut from start to τ=5, we need to go from y=2 to y=0, net down 2, so in 5 steps, we can have some up and down, but we end at 0.\n\nFor example, we could go up to y=4 or 5, but then we need to come down to 0 by τ=5, which takes more down actions, so it might not save time.\n\nLet's calculate the minimal time to reach y=0 at τ=5 from y=2 at τ=0.\n\nWith 5 actions, net change -2.\n\nThe position at each τ must be safe when on 1-8.\n\nBut at τ=0,1,2,3,4, for rows 1-4, all safe except if τ=5, but τ=5 is the time we are at y=0.\n\nSimilarly, if we go to rows 5-8, at τ=0 it is unsafe, so we cannot be on rows 5-8 at τ=0.\n\nAt τ=0, we start at y=2, not 5-8.\n\nAt τ=1,2,3,4, rows 5-8 are safe, since only unsafe at τ=0,5,6.\n\nSo we can be on rows 5-8 at τ=1,2,3,4.\n\nSimilarly, rows 1-4 safe at τ=0,1,2,3,4, except τ=5,6 but we are not on then.\n\nSo for τ=0 to 4, all rows 1-8 are safe, except rows 5-8 at τ=0, but at τ=0 we are at y=2.\n\nSo from τ=0 to 4, we can move freely on all rows.\n\nThen at τ=5, we must be at y=0 or 9, but 9 impossible, so y=0.\n\nSimilarly at τ=6, y=0.\n\nThen after, go up.\n\nSo to have y5=0.\n\nFrom y0=2, to y5=0 in 5 steps.\n\nNet change -2.\n\nWe can take a path that goes up and down but ends at 0 at τ=5.\n\nFor example:\n\nOption 1: go down directly.\n\nτ=0: y=2, a0=D, y1=1\n\nτ=1: y=1, a1=D, y2=0\n\nThen at τ=2, y=0, we can stay: a2=S, y3=0; a3=S, y4=0; a4=S, y5=0\n\nThen y5=0.\n\nOption 2: go up first, then down.\n\nBut to reach y=0 at τ=5.\n\nFor example, τ=0: y=2, a0=U, y1=3\n\nτ=1: y=3, a1=U, y2=4\n\nτ=2: y=4, a2=D, y3=3\n\nτ=3: y=3, a3=D, y4=2\n\nτ=4: y=2, a4=D, y5=1\n\nBut y5=1, not 0.\n\nNot good.\n\nτ=0: a0=U, y1=3\n\nτ=1: a1=U, y2=4\n\nτ=2: a2=U, y3=5\n\nτ=3: y=5, row 5, at τ=3 safe, a3=D, y4=4\n\nτ=4: y=4, a4=D, y5=3\n\ny5=3, not 0.\n\nWorse.\n\nTo reach lower, need more down actions.\n\nBut with 5 actions, from y=2, to end at 0, we need exactly two more down actions than up actions.\n\nLet U actions: u, D actions: d, S actions: s, with u+d+s=5, and net change: u - d = y5 - y0 = 0 - 2 = -2\n\nSo u - d = -2\n\nAnd u + d + s = 5\n\nSubtract: (u+d+s) - (u-d) = 5 - (-2) => 2d + s = 7\n\nSimilarly, add: 2u + s = 3\n\nSince u and d integers, 2d + s =7, s>=0, so d <=3, but 2d+s=7, possible d=3, s=1; or d=2, s=3; etc.\n\nThen from u - d = -2, if d=3, u=1; if d=2, u=0, etc.\n\nAlso, the position must stay within 0-9.\n\nFor example, d=3, u=1, s=1: net down 2, good.\n\nWe can have actions like D,D,D,U,S but net down 2 only if two D and one U, etc.\n\nu=1, d=3, s=1.\n\nFor example: start y=2\n\na0=D, y1=1\n\na1=D, y2=0\n\na2=S, y3=0 (s=1)\n\na3=U, y4=1\n\na4=D, y5=0\n\nThen at τ=5, y=0.\n\nBut at τ=4, y=1, row 1, at τ=4, which is safe, since not τ=5 or 6.\n\nSimilarly, other points safe.\n\nBut we have y5=0.\n\nSimilarly, we can have other sequences.\n\nBut in this case, we have extra movements, but we reach y=0 at τ=5.\n\nThen similarly, we need y6=0, so at τ=5, action S, y6=0\n\nThen at τ=6, y=0.\n\nThen from there, go up to 9.\n\ny6=0 at τ=6\n\na6=U, y7=1\n\nτ=7, y=1, safe\n\na7=U, y8=2\n\n...\n\nup to a14=U, y15=9\n\nSame as before.\n\nIf we go up faster from y6=0, but it still takes 9 steps to go from 0 to 9.\n\nSo H=15.\n\nBut at τ=7, y=1, which is fine.\n\nPerhaps we can start going up earlier, but we have to be at y=0 at τ=5 and 6.\n\nAnother thought: at τ=6, we can be at y=9 if we reached earlier, but impossible.\n\nOr at τ=5, if we are at y=9, impossible.\n\nSo the minimal H is 15.\n\nBut let's confirm if there is a way with less than 15.\n\nSuppose we reach y=9 at τ=8 or something.\n\nFor example, if we are at y=0 at τ=5 and 6, then from τ=6 y=0, go up 9 steps to τ=15 y=9.\n\nIf we can reach a higher position before τ=5, but then we have to go down to 0, which costs time, and we still need to go up from 0.\n\nFor example, suppose at τ=4, we are at y=4, then to be at y=0 at τ=5, we need y5=0, so from y4, if y4=1, a4=D, y5=0.\n\nBut how to get y4=1 from y0=2.\n\nWith 4 actions from τ=0 to set y1 to y4.\n\ny0=2\n\na0 to y1\n\na1 to y2\n\na2 to y3\n\na3 to y4\n\nNeed y4=1.\n\nFrom y=2 to y=1, net change -1.\n\nu - d = -1\n\nu + d + s =4\n\nThen 2d + s =5\n\n2u + s =3\n\nPossible u=1, d=2, s=1 or u=0, d=1, s=3, etc.\n\nFor example: a0=D, y1=1\n\nThen a1=S, y2=1\n\na2=S, y3=1\n\na3=S, y4=1\n\nThen at τ=4, y=1\n\nThen a4=D, y5=0\n\nThen y5=0\n\nBut at τ=4, y=1, safe.\n\nThen a5=S, y6=0? y6=0 for τ=6.\n\ny5=0 at τ=5\n\na5=S, y6=0\n\nThen from y6=0, go up to 9, to y15=9.\n\nStill H=15.\n\nIf we have y4=1, and we go up from there, but at τ=5 we need to be at 0, so we must go down at τ=4 action to set y5=0.\n\nNo gain.\n\nSo it seems H=15 is the minimal.\n\nBut let's think differently.\n\nPerhaps we don't need to be at y=0 at both τ=5 and τ=6; only if we are on the rows, but we can be at y=9 at τ=6 if possible, but not.\n\nOr, at τ=6, if we are at y=9, but we can't at τ=6.\n\nAnother idea: since the unsafe times are only τ=5 and 6 for the rows, we can be at y=0 at τ=5, then at τ=6, we can be at y=9 if we jump, but we can't, only one step.\n\nFrom y=0 at τ=5, after action, y6 = y5 + Δy5.\n\nIf y5=0, and a5=U, y6=1, but at τ=6, y=1, unsafe.\n\nIf a5=S, y6=0, safe.\n\nThen we can start from there.\n\nBut to reach y=9 faster, we need to be higher before τ=5.\n\nBut we have to be at 0 at τ=5.\n\nSo I think H=15 is the best.\n\nBut let's check the car positions again.\n\nPerhaps for some rows, at some times, it is safe even at τ=5 or 6, but no, we saw that at τ=5 and 6, all rows 1-8 are unsafe.\n\nFor example, at τ=5, for any row 1-8, car A is at span [-11,0] for rows 1-4, or for rows 5-8 also car A at [-11,0], so 0 is in the span, so collision if on that row.\n\nSimilarly at τ=6, car A at [-5,6] for all, so 0 in span.\n\nSo yes, all rows 1-8 unsafe at τ=5 and 6.\n\nSo must avoid.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 15 with the path going to y=0 by τ=2, staying until τ=6, then going up to 9.\n\nIn the sequence, we can start going up from τ=6.\n\nBut let's write the actions for the original turn.\n\nFirst, for the player, at turn t_1 + t for t from 0 to H-1.\n\nIn terms of τ, from τ=0 to τ=H-1, actions.\n\nSet τ=0 as turn 11.\n\nPlayer at (0,2)\n\nActions a_{11} to a_{11+H-1}\n\nAfter H actions, at turn 11+H, position y=9.\n\nIn the sequence, we need to specify actions from turn t_1 to t_1 + H-1.\n\nIn the answer format: Turn t_1: a_{t_1}, Turn t_1+1: a_{t_1+1}, ..., up to Turn t_1 + H-1: a_{t_1+H-1}\n\nAnd after that, at turn t_1 + H, y=9.\n\nFor H=15, actions from turn 11 to turn 25.\n\nBut let's see if we can reduce H.\n\nSuppose we reach y=9 at τ=8, for example.\n\nBut to do that, we need to have gone up faster, but with cars, we may have to wait.\n\nBut in this case, the only obstacle is τ=5 and 6.\n\nFor example, if we are at y=4 at τ=4, then at τ=4, y=4, if we go up, y5=5, but at τ=5, y=5, collision.\n\nIf we go down, y5=3, still collision at τ=5.\n\nSo we must not be on 1-8 at τ=5.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps at τ=4, we are at y=0, but to be at y=0 at τ=4, from y=2 at τ=0, we can do it, but then at τ=4, y=0, then at τ=5, we need to be at 0, so stay, similarly at τ=6.\n\nThen from τ=4 or 5 go up, but still from 0 to 9 in 9 steps, so at τ=13 or 14, y=9.\n\nFor example, go down to 0 by τ=2: as before.\n\ny0=2, a0=D, y1=1 at τ=1\n\na1=D, y2=0 at τ=2\n\nThen stay: a2=S, y3=0\n\na3=S, y4=0\n\na4=S, y5=0  // τ=5 y=0\n\na5=S, y6=0  // τ=6 y=0\n\nThen go up: a6=U, y7=1\n\na7=U, y8=2\n\na8=U, y9=3\n\na9=U, y10=4\n\na10=U, y11=5\n\na11=U, y12=6\n\na12=U, y13=7\n\na13=U, y14=8\n\na14=U, y15=9\n\nAt τ=15, y=9.\n\nH=15 actions, from τ=0 to τ=14 actions, y15 at τ=15.\n\nActions at τ=0 to 14.\n\nNow, at each point, we are safe: at τ=0, y=2, safe; τ=1, y=1, safe; τ=2, y=0 safe; τ=3, y=0 safe; τ=4, y=0 safe; τ=5, y=0 safe; τ=6, y=0 safe; τ=7, y=1, row 1, τ=7>6, safe; similarly others.\n\nAll good.\n\nBut can we start going up earlier? For example, after being at y=0, we go up immediately, but we have to stay at 0 for τ=5 and 6.\n\nIn the above, we stay at 0 from τ=2 to τ=6, which is 5 turns at 0, but we only need to be at 0 at τ=5 and 6, so we can be at higher position before.\n\nFor example, at τ=4, we can be at y=2 or something, then go down to 0 at τ=5.\n\nBut to be at y=0 at τ=5, and at τ=4, if we are at y=1, then a4=D, y5=0.\n\nBut how to be at y=1 at τ=4.\n\nFrom y0=2.\n\nWith 4 actions: a0,a1,a2,a3 to set y1,y2,y3,y4.\n\nNeed y4=1.\n\nFrom y=2 to y=1, net change -1.\n\nu - d = -1\n\nu + d + s =4\n\n2d + s =5\n\n2u + s =3\n\nu=1, d=2, s=1 for example.\n\nSequence:\n\nτ=0: y=2, a0=D, y1=1\n\nτ=1: y=1, a1=S, y2=1  // s=1\n\nτ=2: y=1, a2=S, y3=1\n\nτ=3: y=1, a3=S, y4=1\n\nThen at τ=4, y=1\n\nThen a4=D, y5=0\n\nThen at τ=5, y=0\n\nThen a5=S, y6=0  // for τ=6\n\nThen from y6=0, a6=U, y7=1\n\n... same as before, to y15=9.\n\nStill 15 actions.\n\nIf we have less stay, but we need to be at y=1 at τ=4.\n\nFrom y=2, we can go down to 1 at τ=1, then stay or move.\n\nBut same.\n\nSo I think H=15 is minimal.\n\nBut let's confirm the car at τ=0 for rows 5-8.\n\nIn this path, we are not on rows 5-8 at τ=0, so ok.\n\nNow for the action sequence.\n\nIn terms of the turn.\n\nt_1 = 11.\n\nActions from turn 11 to turn 11+14 = turn 25.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 11: a_{11} , since τ=0, action at turn 11.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from turn t_1 to t_1 + H-1.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t_1 + H, position.\n\nHere H=15 actions.\n\nSo actions at turn 11 to turn 25?

Action at turn t is a_t, which determines the move to position at turn t+1.\n\nIn the sequence, we list actions for turns t_1 to t_1 + H-1.\n\nFor H actions, turns t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nAfter that, at turn t_1 + H, position.\n\nHere, actions at turn 11 to 11+14=25.\n\n15 actions: turns 11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25.\n\nAt turn 26, y=9.\n\nNow the actions:\n\nAs above:\n\nAt turn 11: action D (down to y=1 at turn 12)\n\nTurn 11: position (0,2), action a11=D, then at turn 12, position y=1\n\nThen turn 12: position (0,1), action D, to y=0 at turn 13\n\nTurn 13: position (0,0), action S, stay y=0 at turn 14\n\nTurn 14: (0,0), action S, to y=0 at turn 15\n\nTurn 15: (0,0), action S, to y=0 at turn 16\n\nTurn 16: (0,0), action S, to y=0 at turn 17?

Not 0.\n\nTo have y turn 16=0.\n\nFrom turn 13 y=0, with actions at turn 13,14,15 to set y14,y15,y16.\n\ny turn 16 depends on action at turn 15.\n\nIf at turn 15, y=1, action D, y16=0.\n\nBut how to have y turn 15=1.\n\nFrom turn 13 y=0.\n\nAction turn 13: if U, y14=1\n\nThen action turn 14: if S, y15=1\n\nThen action turn 15: D, y16=0\n\nSimilarly, for turn 17, need y17=0.\n\ny turn 17 depends on action turn 16.\n\nAt turn 16, y=0, action S, y17=0\n\nThen from turn 17 y=0, go up.\n\nNow, positions:\n\nTurn 13: y=0, action U, so turn 14 y=1\n\nTurn 14: y=1, action S, so turn 15 y=1\n\nTurn 15: y=1, action D, so turn 16 y=0\n\nTurn 16: y=0, action S, so turn 17 y=0\n\nThen turn 17: y=0, action U, turn 18 y=1\n\netc., same as before to turn 26 y=9.\n\nBut now, from turn 11 to turn 13, we have:\n\nTurn 11: y=2, action D, turn 12 y=1\n\nTurn 12: y=1, action D, turn 13 y=0\n\nThen from turn 13 to 17 as above.\n\nActions: turn 11: D, turn 12: D, turn 13: U, turn 14: S, turn 15: D, turn 16: S, turn 17: U, etc.\n\nBut at turn 14, y=1, which is row 1, at time turn 14, τ= turn 14 - 11 =3, which is safe.\n\nTurn 15, y=1, τ=4, safe.\n\nThen turn 16 y=0, τ=5.\n\nGood.\n\nBut the up part still to turn 26.\n\nSame H.\n\nAnd we used more actions, but same number.\n\nIn this case, we reached y=0 at turn 13, then went up to 1, then down to 0, so extra movements, not better.\n\nSo the first sequence is fine.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 15.\n\nBut let's write the action sequence for the answer.\n\nFrom turn 11 to turn 25 actions.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 11: D\n\nTurn 12: D\n\nTurn 13: S\n\nTurn 14: S\n\nTurn 15: S\n\nTurn 16: S  // for turn 16 action, to keep y=0 at turn 17\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nTurn 11: D  // to y=1 at turn 12\n\nTurn 12: D  // to y=0 at turn 13\n\nTurn 13: S  // stay, y=0 at turn 14\n\nTurn 14: S  // stay, y=0 at turn 15\n\nTurn 15: S  // stay, y=0 at turn 16\n\nTurn 16: S  // stay, y=0 at turn 17\n\nTurn 17: U  // to y=1 at turn 18\n\nTurn 18: U  // to y=2 at turn 19\n\nTurn 19: U  // to y=3 at turn 20\n\nTurn 20: U  // to y=4 at turn 21\n\nTurn 21: U  // to y=5 at turn 22\n\nTurn 22: U  // to y=6 at turn 23\n\nTurn 23: U  // to y=7 at turn 24\n\nTurn 24: U  // to y=8 at turn 25\n\nTurn 25: U  // to y=9 at turn 26\n\nActions from turn 11 to 25, 15 actions.\n\nIn the answer format.\n\nBut we can start going up from turn 17 immediately.\n\nIn turn 17 action U.\n\nBut we need to list the actions.\n\nPerhaps for the freeways 5-8, at τ=0, it is unsafe, but we are not on them at τ=0.\n\nIn the path, when we go up, at turn 22, y=5, which is row 5, at time turn 22, τ=11, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think this is correct.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), and we did.\n\nMinimal turns, but with the constraint, it seems 15 is min.\n\nPerhaps we can go directly to higher rows earlier.\n\nFor example, at τ=1, we can be at y=3, then at τ=2, y=4, etc., but at τ=5, we need to be at 0, so we have to come down, which takes time, and we end up with the same or worse.\n\nSo I think H=15 is the answer.\n</think>\nTo reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 2) at turn \\(t_1 = 11\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the minimal number of turns required is \\(H = 15\\). This sequence ensures that the player is not on any freeway \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) at times \\(\\tau = 5\\) and \\(\\tau = 6\\) (relative to \\(t_1 = 11\\), so turns 16 and 17), when all these freeways are unsafe due to car spans covering position \\(x = 0\\). The player moves down to \\(y = 0\\) by turn 13 and stays there until turn 17 to avoid the unsafe times, then moves up directly to \\(y = 9\\).\n\nThe action sequence is as follows:\n\n- **Turn 11**: Action \\(D\\) (move down to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 12).  \n  At turn 11, \\(y = 2\\) (freeway 2), which is safe at \\(\\tau = 0\\) (since freeways 1-4 are safe except at \\(\\tau = 5,6\\)).\n- **Turn 12**: Action \\(D\\) (move down to \\(y = 0\\) at turn 13).  \n  At turn 12, \\(y = 1\\) (freeway 1), safe at \\(\\tau = 1\\).\n- **Turn 13**: Action \\(S\\) (stay at \\(y = 0\\) for turn 14).  \n  \\(y = 0\\) is always safe (no cars).\n- **Turn 14**: Action \\(S\\) (stay at \\(y = 0\\) for turn 15).  \n  \\(y = 0\\) safe.\n- **Turn 15**: Action \\(S\\) (stay at \\(y = 0\\) for turn 16).  \n  \\(y = 0\\) safe.\n- **Turn 16**: Action \\(S\\) (stay at \\(y = 0\\) for turn 17).  \n  At turn 16 (\\(\\tau = 5\\)), \\(y = 0\\) avoids collision (freeways 1-8 unsafe).\n- **Turn 17**: Action \\(U\\) (move up to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 18).  \n  At turn 17 (\\(\\tau = 6\\)), \\(y = 0\\) avoids collision.

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to get the player from (0,2) at turn 13 to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. The player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing the y-position by +1, -1, or 0, staying within 0 to 9.\n\nCars are on each freeway from 1 to 8. For each freeway, there are cars with positions given at turn 13. All cars are moving right, with speed 6. The car positions are given as (head, tail, direction, speed). Since they're all moving right, direction is right, so the head is greater than the tail, and as time increases, the car moves to the right, so positions increase.\n\nThe span for a right-moving car at time T is [τ + s*(T - t1), h + s*(T - t1)], where t1 is the current turn, 13.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if the player is on a freeway y at that turn, and for any car on that freeway, 0 is in the span at time T. Meaning the car covers x=0 at that time.\n\nImportant note: when the player moves to a new y, at turn T, if they move, they are not on y_{T+1} until the next turn. So at turn T, after action, they are on y_T for collision check. If they decide to move to y_{T+1} at turn T, they are still on y_T at turn T, so only cars on y_T matter for collision at turn T. Cars on y_{T+1} don't affect until turn T+1.\n\nStart: turn 13, player at y=2.\n\nGoal: reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nMinimal H: since from y=2 to y=9, need to increase by 7, each U move increases by 1, so minimum 7 turns if I can move up every turn without collision. But I have to avoid cars, so it might take longer if there are obstacles.\n\nNow, look at the car states.\n\nFor each freeway, cars are given. Let me list them for each y.\n\nFreeway k=1 to 8.\n\nFor k=1: cars: (-18,-29,right,6) and (30,19,right,6)\n\nHead and tail: for the first car, head is -18, tail is -29? That seems odd. If direction is right, head should be greater than tail, but -18 > -29? -18 is greater than -29, yes, since -18 is to the right of -29 on the x-axis, I assume x increases to the right.\n\nIn the span, for right-moving: [τ, h] with h > τ.\n\nHere, first car: h=-18, τ=-29, so since h > τ, and direction right, so at time t, span is [τ + s(t-t1), h + s(t-t1)]\n\nSimilarly, second car: h=30, τ=19, but 30 > 19, yes.\n\nτ is tail, h is head.\n\nIn the notation: (head h, tail τ, direction, speed)\n\nFor first car: h=-18, τ=-29, d=right, s=6.\n\nSince d=right, at time T, span = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] = [-29 + 6*(T-13), -18 + 6*(T-13)]\n\nSimilarly, second car: h=30, τ=19, so [19 + 6*(T-13), 30 + 6*(T-13)]\n\nBut τ=19, h=30, so min is τ=19, max is h=30, so [19 + 6ΔT, 30 + 6ΔT] where ΔT = T - t1 = T - 13.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow for freeways 1 to 4, it's the same: two cars each: one from (-18,-29) and one from (30,19)\n\nLet me compute the spans at time T.\n\nSet ΔT = T - 13.\n\nFor freeway 1:\n\nCar A: span = [-29 + 6ΔT, -18 + 6ΔT]\n\nCar B: span = [19 + 6ΔT, 30 + 6ΔT]\n\nCollision at freeway 1 if player is on y=1 at turn T and 0 is in one of these spans.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 2,3,4 same cars.\n\nNow freeway 5: three cars: (-18,-29,right,6), (18,7,right,6), (54,43,right,6)\n\nSimilarly for 6,7,8 same.\n\nFirst, for freeways 1-4:\n\nCar A: [-29 + 6ΔT, -18 + 6ΔT]\n\nCar B: [19 + 6ΔT, 30 + 6ΔT]\n\nNow, 0 in span A if -29 + 6ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ -18 + 6ΔT\n\nSimilarly for B: 19 + 6ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ 30 + 6ΔT\n\nBut 0 ≤ 30 + 6ΔT is always true for ΔT >=0 since 30+6ΔT >=30>0, similarly 19+6ΔT >=19>0? 19>0, so for B, 19+6ΔT >=19>0, so 0 ≤ 30+6ΔT true, but 19+6ΔT ≤ 0? 19+6ΔT >=19>0, so 19+6ΔT ≤ 0 is false for all ΔT, since min is 19 at ΔT=0. So 0 is never in span B because the left end is at least 19, so 0 < 19 <= left, so 0 not in [left, right].\n\nSimilarly, for span A: -29 +6ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ -18 +6ΔT\n\nSolve inequalities.\n\nFirst, -29 +6ΔT ≤ 0 => 6ΔT ≤ 29 => ΔT ≤ 29/6 ≈ 4.833, so ΔT <=4 since integer? ΔT is integer, turns.\n\nT is turn number, integer, so ΔT integer.\n\n-29 +6ΔT ≤ 0 => 6ΔT ≤ 29 => ΔT ≤ 29/6 = 4 + 5/6, so ΔT <=4\n\nAnd 0 ≤ -18 +6ΔT => 6ΔT >=18 => ΔT >=3\n\nSo for span A, 0 in span when ΔT=3 or 4.\n\nΔT=3: -29+18= -11, -18+18=0? -18 +6*3 = -18+18=0, so at ΔT=3, span A: [-29+18, -18+18] = [-11, 0]\n\n0 is included, since ≤.\n\nSimilarly, ΔT=4: -29+24= -5, -18+24=6, so [-5,6], 0 in it.\n\nΔT=5: -29+30=1, -18+30=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, for span B, as I said, left end 19+6ΔT >=19>0, so 0 never in span.\n\nSo for freeway 1, collision only if on y=1 at T with ΔT=3 or 4, i.e., T=13+3=16 or T=13+4=17.\n\nSimilarly for freeways 2,3,4 same, since same cars.\n\nNow freeway 5,6,7,8 have three cars.\n\nFreeway 5: cars: A: (-18,-29,right,6) same as before\n\nB: (18,7,right,6) head=18, tail=7\n\nC: (54,43,right,6) head=54, tail=43\n\nAll right-moving.\n\nSpan at T:\n\nCar A: [-29 +6ΔT, -18 +6ΔT]\n\nCar B: [7 +6ΔT, 18 +6ΔT]  // τ=7, h=18\n\nCar C: [43 +6ΔT, 54 +6ΔT]\n\nNow, 0 in span:\n\nFor A: same as before, ΔT=3 or 4.\n\nFor B: [7+6ΔT, 18+6ΔT], left min 7>0, so 0 never in.\n\nFor C: [43+6ΔT,54+6ΔT], left min 43>0, 0 never in.\n\nSo for freeway 5, collision only from car A at ΔT=3 or 4.\n\nSimilarly for freeways 6,7,8 same.\n\nBut freeway 5 has car B and C, but their spans start at 7 and 43, so 0 not covered, so only car A matters for collision at x=0.\n\nSimilarly for all freeways, the only car that can cover x=0 is the first one, (-18,-29,right,6), and it covers x=0 at ΔT=3 and 4, i.e., turn 16 and 17.\n\nFor freeways 1-4, only that car, for 5-8, also only that car, since other cars are to the right.\n\nSo, in summary, for any freeway k from 1 to 8, there is a collision if the player is on that freeway at turn T where T=16 or T=17.\n\nBecause at T=16, ΔT=3, car span [-11,0] for that car, includes 0.\n\nAt T=17, ΔT=4, span [-5,6], includes 0.\n\nAt other times, no collision possible from that car or others.\n\nFor example, at T=15, ΔT=2, car A: [-29+12, -18+12] = [-17,-6], all negative, 0 not in.\n\nT=18, ΔT=5, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo only at T=16 and 17, for any y from 1 to 8, if player is on y at that time, collision occurs.\n\nBut the player starts at turn 13, y=2.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\ny=9 is the goal, and cars are only on y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\ny=0 is bottom, y=9 top, cars on freeways 1-8.\n\nAt turn T, if player is on y=0 or y=9, no collision possible, since no cars there.\n\nNow, we need to reach (0,9), so y=9.\n\nMinimal turns: from y=2 to y=9, difference 7, so at least 7 turns if moving up every turn.\n\nBut at turns 16 and 17, if player is on any y from 1 to 8, collision.\n\nTurn 16 and 17 are relative to t1=13.\n\nTurn 13: current turn.\n\nTurn 14: ΔT=1\n\nTurn 15: ΔT=2\n\nTurn 16: ΔT=3\n\nTurn 17: ΔT=4\n\nTurn 18: ΔT=5, etc.\n\nSo turns 16 and 17 are dangerous for any y=1-8.\n\nNow, player starts at turn 13, y=2.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nPossible actions: U, D, S.\n\nTo minimize H, we want to move up as much as possible.\n\nBut we must avoid being on y=1-8 at turns 16 and 17.\n\nSince collision only at those two turns.\n\nAt other turns, no collision possible, so we can be on any y except at 16 and 17, we cannot be on 1-8.\n\nAt turn 16 and 17, player must be on y=0 or y=9 to avoid collision.\n\ny=9 is the goal, so we might reach early or stay.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9, so if we reach before, we can stop, but actions until we reach.\n\nThe sequence should continue until we are at y=9 at some turn.\n\nIn the action sequence, we specify actions until the turn before we reach, I think.\n\nLet's see the update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, so after action at t, position at t+1.\n\nStart at turn t1=13, position given (0,y_t1) = (0,2)\n\nAfter action a_t1, we get to position at turn t1+1, and so on.\n\nWe need y_{t1 + H} = 9? Let's see.\n\nAt turn t1 + t for t=0 to H-1, actions, and after H actions, we should be at (0,9).\n\nDefine the turns.\n\nAt the beginning of turn t, position is (0, y_t)\n\nThen we choose action a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nSo after action at t, position at t+1.\n\nWe start at turn 13, position y_13 = 2.\n\nAfter actions from t=13 to t=13+H-1, we have positions from y_14 to y_{13+H}.\n\nWe want y_{13+H} = 9.\n\nAnd H minimal.\n\nCollision is checked at each turn T, based on position y_T.\n\nIf at turn T, y_T is between 1 and 8, and for that freeway, 0 in car span at T, collision.\n\nHere, only at T=16 and T=17, collision possible if on y=1-8.\n\nAt other T, no collision.\n\nSo, to avoid collision, at turn 16 and turn 17, player must not be on y=1-8, so must be on y=0 or y=9.\n\nNow, since we are starting from y=2 at turn 13, and need to get to y=9.\n\nList the turns: turn 13,14,15,16,17,18,...\n\nAt turn 13: y=2 (safe, but collision only if on y=1-8 at 16 or 17, at turn 13, y=2, which is freeway 2, but at turn 13, ΔT=0, car spans: for y=2, car A: [-29, -18], both negative, 0 not in. Car B: [19,30], both positive, 0 not in. So no collision at turn 13. Similarly for other turns except 16 and 17.\n\nNow, we need to be at y=0 or y=9 at turn 16 and turn 17.\n\ny=9 is the goal, so if we reach y=9 before turn 16, we can stay there, but action S to stay.\n\nBut at turn 16 and 17, if we are at y=9, safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 safe.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9 eventually.\n\nNow, from turn 13 to turn 16: 3 turns (13 to 14,14 to 15,15 to 16), so 3 actions to affect position at turn 16.\n\nSimilarly, to turn 17, 4 actions.\n\nStart: turn 13, y=2.\n\nAfter action a_13, y_14 = y_13 + Δy_13\n\nThen a_14, y_15 = y_14 + Δy_14\n\na_15, y_16 = y_15 + Δy_15\n\na_16, y_17 = y_16 + Δy_16\n\na_17, y_18 = y_17 + Δy_17, etc.\n\nPosition at turn T is y_T.\n\nWe care about y_16 and y_17 must be 0 or 9.\n\ny_18, etc., but we want to reach y=9 asap.\n\nSince no other constraints, we should move up as much as possible, except to satisfy the safe positions at 16 and 17.\n\nNow, y_16 must be 0 or 9.\n\nSimilarly y_17 must be 0 or 9.\n\ny_17 depends on y_16 and action a_16.\n\nBut we need to get to y=9.\n\nCurrent y=2.\n\nIf we want y_16=9, that means from y_13=2 to y_16=9, need to increase by 7 in 3 steps (from turn 13 to 14,14 to 15,15 to 16: 3 actions).\n\nEach action can change y by at most +1, so maximum y_16 = 2 + 3*1 = 5 if all U.\n\n2 to 3,3 to 4,4 to 5, so y_16 <= 5 if we start from 2.\n\ny_13=2\n\nAfter a_13: y_14 = 2 + Δy_13, where Δy in {-1,0,1}\n\nThen y_15 = y_14 + Δy_14\n\ny_16 = y_15 + Δy_15\n\nSo y_16 = 2 + Δy_13 + Δy_14 + Δy_15\n\nSince each Δy <=1, y_16 <= 2 +1+1+1 =5\n\nSimilarly, min y_16 = 2 -3 = -1, but y>=0, so min 0 if all D, but not useful.\n\nSo y_16 cannot be 9, since max 5.\n\nSimilarly, cannot be 9 at turn 16.\n\nTherefore, y_16 must be 0, since it has to be 0 or 9, but 9 impossible.\n\ny_16 must be 0 or 9, but 9 not possible, so must be 0.\n\nSimilarly, for y_17.\n\ny_17 = y_16 + Δy_16\n\nIf y_16=0, then y_17 = 0 + Δy_16, which is -1,0,1, but y>=0, so y_17 can be 0 or 1.\n\nBut y_17 must be 0 or 9.\n\nIf y_17=1, which is between 1-8, and at turn 17, collision if on 1-8.\n\nBut y_17=1 is not 0 or 9, so if y_17=1, collision.\n\nTherefore, from y_16=0, y_17 must be 0 or 9, but y_17=0+ Δy_16 <=1, so only possible if y_17=0.\n\nIf Δy_16=0, y_17=0; if Δy_16=1, y_17=1; if Δy_16=-1, y_17=-1 invalid.\n\nSo only possible y_17=0 if we stay or move down, but move down from 0 to -1 invalid, so only S, y_17=0.\n\nBut y_17=0 or 9, so y_17=0 is acceptable.\n\nBut we need to get to y=9 eventually.\n\nNow, after turn 17, no collision danger, so we can move up freely.\n\nBut y_17=0, and we need to go to y=9.\n\nFrom y_17=0, to y=9, need at least 9 moves up.\n\nBut let's see the turns.\n\nFirst, y_16 must be 0.\n\nSince from y_13=2, to y_16=0, need to decrease by 2 in 3 steps.\n\ny_16 = 2 + sum_{t=13 to15} Δy_t = 0\n\nSo sum_{t=13 to15} Δy_t = -2\n\nEach Δy_t >= -1, so to get sum -2, possible with two D and one S, or other combinations.\n\nNow, similarly, y_17 must be 0 or 9, but as above, if y_16=0, y_17 must be 0, since cannot reach 9 from 0 in one step.\n\ny_17 = y_16 + Δy_16 = 0 + Δy_16\n\nΔy_16 <=1, so y_17 <=1 <9, so y_17 cannot be 9, must be 0.\n\nThus, we must have y_16=0 and y_17=0.\n\nThen after that, from turn 17, position y_17=0, we need to go to y=9.\n\nNo more danger, so we can move up as fast as possible.\n\nBut H should be minimal, so we want to start moving up as soon as possible.\n\nNow, from turn 13 to 16: we need to get to y_16=0.\n\ny_13=2\n\nActions at t=13,14,15 affect y_16.\n\ny_16 = y_15 + Δy_15\n\nBut y_15 = y_14 + Δy_14\n\ny_14 = y_13 + Δy_13 = 2 + Δy_13\n\nSet Δy_13, Δy_14, Δy_15 such that y_16 = 2 + Δy_13 + Δy_14 + Δy_15 = 0\n\nEach Δy in {-1,0,1}, so the sum must be -2.\n\nPossible combinations:\n\n- Two D and one S: for example, D,D,S in some order.\n\n- Or one D and two S? D and two S: -1 +0 +0 = -1, not -2.\n\n- Three D: -1-1-1=-3, but y cannot go below 0.\n\ny_14 = 2 + Δy_13, must be >=0.\n\nSimilarly y_15 = y_14 + Δy_14 >=0\n\ny_16 = y_15 + Δy_15 >=0\n\nSo we need to reach y=0 at turn 16 without going below 0.\n\nTo get sum Δy = -2 over three steps.\n\nWith y min 0.\n\nStart y=2.\n\nAfter first action, y_14 = 2 + Δy_13\n\nΔy_13 can be -1,0,1\n\nIf Δy_13 = -1, y_14=1\n\nThen if Δy_14 = -1, y_15=0\n\nThen Δy_15 =0, y_16=0\n\nOr if Δy_14=0, y_15=1, then Δy_15=-1, y_16=0\n\nIf Δy_13=0, y_14=2\n\nThen to get to 0, need Δy_14 and Δy_15 sum to -2.\n\nBut each >= -1, so min sum -2, only if both -1.\n\nSo y_15 = y_14 + Δy_14 = 2 + (-1) =1\n\nThen y_16 =1 + Δy_15 =1 + (-1) =0\n\nIf Δy_13=1, y_14=3, but we need to go down to 0, but y_14=3, then need to go down to 0 in two steps: y_15 =3 + Δy_14, if Δy_14=-1, y_15=2, then y_16=2 + Δy_15, if Δy_15=-1, y_16=1, not 0; if Δy_15=0, y_16=2; if -1,1. Cannot reach 0 from 3 in two steps with min y=0.\n\ny_15 min 1 if from 3 with down, but y_15=2 or 1 or 3? From y_14=3, Δy_14=-1, y_15=2; Δy_14=0, y_15=3; Δy_14=1, y_15=4.\n\nThen y_16 from 2,3, or4, cannot be 0 in one step.\n\nSo only possibilities: we must decrease early.\n\nSpecifically, to have y_16=0, we need to be at y=1 at turn 15, and then move down to 0.\n\nOr at y=0 at turn 15 and stay.\n\nBut from above:\n\nCase 1: Δy_13 = -1, so a_13=D, y_14=1\n\nThen at turn 14, y=1.\n\nNow, to have y_16=0.\n\ny_15 = y_14 + Δy_14 =1 + Δy_14\n\nThen y_16 = y_15 + Δy_15\n\nSet y_16=0.\n\nIf y_15=1, then Δy_15 must be -1, so a_15=D, y_16=0\n\nAnd y_15=1, which requires from above, with y_14=1, if Δy_14=0, y_15=1; if Δy_14=-1, y_15=0; if Δy_14=1, y_15=2\n\nIf y_15=0, then y_16 =0 + Δy_15, must be 0, so Δy_15=0, S, y_16=0\n\nIf y_15=1, then Δy_15=-1, D, y_16=0\n\nIf y_15=2, then y_16=2 + Δy_15, cannot be 0, since Δy_15>=-1, y_16>=1.\n\nSo for y_14=1, we can have:\n\n- Δy_14=0, y_15=1, then Δy_15=-1, y_16=0\n\n- Δy_14=-1, y_15=0, then Δy_15=0, y_16=0\n\n- Δy_14=1, y_15=2, then cannot reach y_16=0, so not possible.\n\nBack to Δy_13: if Δy_13=0, y_14=2\n\nThen y_15=2 + Δy_14\n\nIf Δy_14=-1, y_15=1\n\nThen y_16=1 + Δy_15, set to 0, so Δy_15=-1, y_16=0\n\nIf Δy_14=0, y_15=2, then y_16=2 + Δy_15, cannot be 0.\n\nIf Δy_14=1, y_15=3, worse.\n\nSo only if Δy_14=-1, y_15=1, then Δy_15=-1, y_16=0\n\nSimilarly, if Δy_13=1, y_14=3, then as above, cannot reach y_16=0.\n\nTherefore, only possible ways:\n\nOption A: a_13 = D, y_14=1\n\nThen at turn 14, y=1\n\nNow, sub-options:\n\nA1: a_14 = S, y_15=1, then a_15 = D, y_16=0\n\nA2: a_14 = D, y_15=0, then a_15 = S, y_16=0\n\nOption B: a_13 = S, y_14=2\n\nThen a_14 = D, y_15=1\n\nThen a_15 = D, y_16=0\n\nWe cannot have a_13 = U, because that would make y_14=3, then cannot reach y_16=0.\n\nNow, for y_17, we need y_17=0.\n\ny_17 = y_16 + Δy_16\n\nSince y_16=0, y_17 = 0 + Δy_16\n\nMust be 0 or 9, but Δy_16 <=1, so y_17 <=1 <9, so must be y_17=0, thus Δy_16=0, so a_16 must be S.\n\nThen y_17=0.\n\nNow, after that, from turn 17, y=0, we need to go to y=9.\n\nNo danger at turns after 17.\n\nSo we can move up every turn.\n\nFrom y_17=0, after action a_17, y_18 = 0 + Δy_17\n\nIf a_17=U, y_18=1\n\nThen a_18=U, y_19=2, ..., up to y_26=9? Let's see.\n\ny_17=0\n\nAfter a_17, y_18\n\nWe want to reach y=9 at some turn T.\n\nSince we move up, each U increases y by 1.\n\nFrom y=0 to y=9, need 9 steps up.\n\nAfter H actions from turn 17, but actions start from turn 17.\n\nTurn: at turn 17, position y_17=0\n\nWe apply action a_17, then y_18 = y_17 + Δy_17\n\nIf a_17=U, y_18=1\n\na_18=U, y_19=2\n\n...\n\nAfter k actions, y_{17+k} = 0 + number of U in first k actions.\n\nTo have y_{17+k} =9, need exactly k actions with all U, but since we can only move up, yes, but we need to reach exactly, so with k U actions, y_{17+k} = k.\n\nSet equal to 9, so k=9.\n\nThus, after 9 actions starting from turn 17, we reach y_{26} =9.\n\nActions from t=17 to t=25, 9 actions, y_26=9.\n\nBut turn 17: action a_17, to y_18\n\n...\n\na_25 to y_26=9\n\nNow, total turns from start.\n\nStart turn 13.\n\nWe have actions up to a_16 to set y_17=0.\n\nThen actions from a_17 to a_25 to go up.\n\nBut we need the sequence from t=13 onwards.\n\nFirst, we need to choose how to get to y_16=0 and y_17=0.\n\nFrom above, we have options.\n\nBut H should be minimal, meaning the number of actions until we reach y=9.\n\nWe reach y=9 at turn 26, since y_26=9 after a_25.\n\nThe actions are from t=13 to t=25, that's 13 actions? Let's count.\n\nTurn 13: action a_13\n\na_14\n\na_15\n\na_16\n\na_17\n\n...\n\na_25\n\nThat's from t=13 to t=25 inclusive, which is 25-13+1=13 actions.\n\nAfter 13 actions, y_{26} =9.\n\nBut is this minimal?\n\nEarlier I thought min 7, but we have to spend turns going down to avoid collision.\n\nWe could reach y=9 later but with fewer actions? No, since we need to increase y by 7, but we went down to 0, then up to 9, so net increase 7, but with detour, so more actions.\n\nMinimal actions would be 7 if no obstacles, but with obstacles, we have to take more.\n\nIn this case, we must be at 0 at turn 16 and 17, so we have to go down, then up.\n\nBut perhaps we can reach y=9 before turn 16? But earlier we saw impossible, since max y_16=5<9.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 17, y_17 must be 0, not 9.\n\nSo cannot reach before turn 18 or later.\n\nAt turn 18, y_18 could be something.\n\nBut at turn 17, we are at 0, so y_18 at least 0, up to 1 if we move up.\n\nBut to reach 9, need later.\n\nNow, back to the sequence.\n\nWe need to specify actions from t=13 to the action before reaching y=9.\n\nIn this case, we reach at turn 26.\n\nBut let's confirm if we can start moving up earlier.\n\nIn the options above, for the down part, we have choices that affect when we can start moving up.\n\nFor example, in option A1: a_13=D, y_14=1\n\na_14=S, y_15=1\n\na_15=D, y_16=0\n\na_16=S, y_17=0\n\nThen from turn 17, a_17=U, y_18=1\n\na_18=U, y_19=2\n\n...\n\na_25=U, y_26=9\n\nActions from t=13 to t=25: 13 actions.\n\nSimilarly, option A2: a_13=D, y_14=1\n\na_14=D, y_15=0\n\na_15=S, y_16=0  // since y_15=0, S, y_16=0\n\na_16=S, y_17=0  // must be S to stay\n\nThen a_17=U, etc., same as above.\n\nIn A2: a_15=S with y_15=0, y_16=0\n\nThen a_16=S, y_17=0\n\nNow option B: a_13=S, y_14=2\n\na_14=D, y_15=1\n\na_15=D, y_16=0\n\na_16=S, y_17=0\n\nThen a_17=U, etc.\n\nIn all cases, we have y_17=0 at turn 17.\n\nThen we need 9 U actions to reach y=9 at turn 26.\n\nBut is there a way to be higher when we start moving up?\n\nFor example, if we can be at y>0 at turn 17, but we cannot, because y_17 must be 0, as established.\n\nUnless we can be at y=9 at turn 17, but impossible from start.\n\nPerhaps we don't need to be at 0 at turn 17 if we can avoid collision another way, but at turn 17, if on y=1-8, collision, so must be on 0 or 9.\n\nAnd 9 impossible, so must be 0.\n\nSimilarly for 16.\n\nSo no choice.\n\nBut in the down phase, we can choose to stay or down, but in all cases, we end up at y=0 at turn 17.\n\nThen from there, we go up.\n\nBut to minimize H, since we have to go from 0 to 9, it takes 9 turns, so H=13 is fixed? H is the number of actions.\n\nFrom turn 13 to turn 25, actions, 13 actions.\n\nBut let's list the turns.\n\nTurn 13: start, position y=2\n\nAfter a_13, y_14\n\n...\n\nAfter a_25, y_26=9\n\nThe sequence has actions from t=13 to t=25, which is H=13 actions.\n\nBut we need to output the actions from t_1 to t_1 + H-1, with H minimal.\n\nt_1=13.\n\nIn the answer, it should be actions for turn t_1, t_1+1, ..., up to the action that brings us to y=9.\n\nAfter H actions, we are at position after turn t_1 + H.\n\nStart: turn t_1, position y_{t_1}\n\nAfter action a_{t_1}, position y_{t_1 +1}\n\n...\n\nAfter action a_{t_1 + H -1}, position y_{t_1 + H}\n\nWe want y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nHere t_1=13.\n\nSo y_{13 + H} =9.\n\nIn our case, y_26=9, so 13 + H =26, thus H=13.\n\nActions from a_13 to a_25.\n\nNow, for the down part, we can choose any of the options, but to minimize time, since we go up later, all same.\n\nBut we might start moving up earlier if we go down faster.\n\nFor example, in option A2: a_13=D, y_14=1\n\na_14=D, y_15=0\n\nNow at turn 15, y=0.\n\nBut we need y_16=0, so a_15 must be S, y_16=0\n\nSimilarly, a_16=S, y_17=0\n\nThen from a_17=U, etc.\n\nIf at turn 15, y=0, but we cannot move up because at turn 16, we need y_16=0, so if we move up at a_15, y_16=1, then at turn 16, y=1, which is dangerous, collision.\n\nSimilarly, we must have y_16=0, so at turn 15, if y=0, we must stay, cannot move up.\n\nSimilarly, if y=1 at turn 15, we must move down to 0 at turn 16.\n\nSo no benefit.\n\nIn terms of position, at turn 17 we are at 0, then we start moving up.\n\nThe earliest we can be at y=9 is turn 26.\n\nBut is there another way?\n\nPerhaps we can be at y=9 at turn 17? Impossible.\n\nOr at turn 18: y_18.\n\ny_18 = y_17 + Δy_17\n\ny_17=0, so y_18 <=1, not 9.\n\nSimilarly, turn 19: y_19 <=2, etc., up to turn 26: y_26=9 if all U from 17.\n\nSo yes, turn 26 is earliest possible to reach y=9.\n\nNow, back to actions.\n\nWe need to specify the sequence.\n\nFor the down part, we can choose.\n\nFor example, let's take option B: a_13=S, y_14=2\n\na_14=D, y_15=1\n\na_15=D, y_16=0\n\nThen a_16=S, y_17=0\n\nThen a_17=U, y_18=1\n\na_18=U, y_19=2\n\na_19=U, y_20=3\n\na_20=U, y_21=4\n\na_21=U, y_22=5\n\na_22=U, y_23=6\n\na_23=U, y_24=7\n\na_24=U, y_25=8\n\na_25=U, y_26=9\n\nSo after a_25, y_26=9.\n\nActions from t=13 to t=25.\n\nIn the sequence, we need to list for each turn.\n\nIn the answer format: Turn t: a_t\n\nSo for turn 13: S (from above)\n\nIn option B: a_13=S\n\nBut we could have other choices.\n\nTo be safe, let's make sure no collision at other points.\n\nFor example, at turn 14: y_14=2 (after a_13=S)\n\ny=2, freeway 2, at turn 14.\n\nΔT = T -13, turn 14, ΔT=1.\n\nCar spans: for freeway 2, car A: [-29 +6*1, -18 +6*1] = [-23, -12], 0 not in.\n\nCar B: [19+6,30+6]=[25,36], 0 not in. Safe.\n\nTurn 15: y_15=1 (after a_14=D)\n\ny=1, freeway 1, ΔT=2.\n\nCar A: [-29+12, -18+12] = [-17,-6], 0 not in.\n\nCar B: [19+12,30+12]=[31,42], not. Safe.\n\nTurn 16: y_16=0, which is not on freeway, safe.\n\nTurn 17: y_17=0, safe.\n\nThen turns 18 to 25: y from 1 to 8, but at these times, no car covers x=0, since only at ΔT=3,4, i.e., turn 16,17, but turn 16 and 17 we are at y=0, not on freeway.\n\nAt turn 18, ΔT=5, car spans: e.g., freeway 1 car A: [-29+30, -18+30]=[1,12], not include 0.\n\nSimilarly others, so no collision.\n\nSo safe.\n\nIn this sequence, we have a_13=S, but we could have a_13=D.\n\nFor example, option A2: a_13=D, y_14=1\n\na_14=D, y_15=0\n\na_15=S, y_16=0\n\na_16=S, y_17=0\n\nThen a_17 to a_25 U.\n\nAt turn 14: y=1, ΔT=1, car A: [-23,-12], not 0, safe.\n\nTurn 15: y=0, safe.\n\nEtc.\n\nSimilarly fine.\n\nTo minimize the number of actions? All same H=13.\n\nBut perhaps we can start moving up earlier if we go down faster, but in all cases, we are stuck at 0 until turn 17.\n\nFor example, if at turn 15 we are at 0, but we must stay to have y_16=0, cannot move up.\n\nSimilarly, only from turn 17 we can move up.\n\nSo no difference.\n\nTherefore, H=13 is minimal.\n\nNow, for the sequence, I need to output actions from turn 13 to turn 25.\n\nBut in the answer, it should be from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, which is 13 to 13+12=25? H=13 actions, from a_13 to a_25.\n\nt_1 + H -1 = 13 + 13 -1 = 25, yes.\n\nNow, in the sequence, for the up part, all U except the initial down.\n\nBut in the down part, we can choose.\n\nTo make it simple, let's use the sequence I have.\n\nFor example:\n\nTurn 13: S  (a_13=S)\n\nBut S means stay, y=2.\n\nThen Turn 14: D  (a_14=D), to y=1\n\nTurn 15: D  (a_15=D), to y=0? In my earlier, a_15=D from y=1 to y=0 at turn 16? Let's clarify.\n\nPosition at turn T: y_T\n\nAfter action a_T, y_{T+1}\n\nAt turn 13: y_13=2\n\na_13: if S, then y_14=2\n\na_14: if D, then y_15= y_14 + (-1) = 2-1=1? y_15 = y_14 + Δy_14\n\ny_14=2, a_14=D, Δy=-1, so y_15=2-1=1\n\nThen at turn 15: y_15=1\n\na_15: if D, Δy=-1, y_16=1-1=0\n\nThen at turn 16: y_16=0\n\na_16: S, Δy=0, y_17=0\n\nThen turn 17: y_17=0\n\na_17: U, y_18=1\n\na_18: U, y_19=2\n\n...\n\na_25: U, y_26=9\n\nIn terms of actions:\n\nTurn 13: S  // a_13, to y_14=2\n\nTurn 14: D  // a_14, to y_15=1\n\nTurn 15: D  // a_15, to y_16=0\n\nTurn 16: S  // a_16, to y_17=0\n\nThen Turn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\n...\n\nUp to Turn 25: U\n\nNow, from turn 17 to 25, that's 9 turns: 17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25.\n\nActions a_17 to a_25, 9 actions.\n\nIn the sequence, we need to list all actions from t=13 to t=25.\n\nt=13: S\n\nt=14: D\n\nt=15: D\n\nt=16: S\n\nt=17: U\n\nt=18: U\n\nt=19: U\n\nt=20: U\n\nt=21: U\n\nt=22: U\n\nt=23: U\n\nt=24: U\n\nt=25: U\n\nIn the answer, it should be in the box.\n\nBut let's confirm the turns.\n\nCurrent turn t_1=13.\n\nWe need minimal H and sequence.\n\nH=13 actions.\n\nSequence: as above.\n\nTo save space, we can write the U part once.\n\nBut in the output, list each turn.\n\nSince from t=17 to 25 all U, we can say.\n\nBut in the format, we need to write each.\n\nNow, another thing: in the car state, for freeway 5-8, there are more cars, but as we saw, only the left car matters, and it covers x=0 only at turn 16 and 17, which we avoid.\n\nAlso, at turn 15, for example, y=1, which is freeway 1, at ΔT=2, car span [-17,-6], not cover 0, safe.\n\nSimilarly all good.\n\nPerhaps we can have a sequence where we go down immediately.\n\nFor example, a_13=D, y_14=1\n\na_14=S, y_15=1\n\na_15=D, y_16=0\n\na_16=S, y_17=0\n\nThen same up.\n\na_13=D, then y_14=1\n\nBut at turn 14, y=1, ΔT=1, safe as before.\n\nThen a_14=S, y_15=1\n\nThen a_15=D, y_16=0\n\netc.\n\nSimilar.\n\nI think any is fine.\n\nNow, in the sequence above, with a_13=S, we stay at y=2 for one turn, which is fine.\n\nBut to be more efficient, we could go down immediately.\n\nBut since we have to wait until after turn 17 to move up, it doesn't save time.\n\nSo either way.\n\nI'll go with the first sequence.\n\nNow, for the answer.\n\nWe need to output the actions.\n\nAlso, in the sequence, from turn 17 to 25, all U, but turn 17 action to y_18=1, etc.\n\nNow, in the box.\n\nFirst, minimal H: 13\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 13: S\n\nTurn 14: D\n\nTurn 15: D\n\nTurn 16: S\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nTurn 20: U\n\nTurn 21: U\n\nTurn 22: U\n\nTurn 23: U\n\nTurn 24: U\n\nTurn 25: U\n\nIn the sequence, turn 17 to 25 is 9 actions U.\n\nBut we need to list.\n\nSince it's repetitive, but in text, we have to write.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be fine.\n\nPerhaps we can write \"Turn 17 to Turn 25: U each\" but I think we need to list each turn as per format.\n\nThe format says: Turn t_1: a_{t_1} etc., so list each.\n\nNow, I think it's ok.\n\nBut let's make sure about the collision note.\n\nThe note says: if you decide to move to y_{T+1} != y_T at turn T, you are not on y_{T+1} at turn T, so not collided by cars on y_{T+1} at turn T.\n\nBut in our case, at dangerous turns, we are not on freeway, so no issue.\n\nFor example, when we move, at turn T, we are on y_T for collision.\n\nIn our sequence, at turn 14, we move from y=2 to y=1? At turn 14, position y_14=2 (after a_13=S), then we apply a_14=D, which moves to y_15=1, but at turn 14, we are on y=2, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly, no problem.\n\nSo I think correct.\n\nTherefore, H=13.\n\nBut is there a shorter way?\n\nSuppose at turn 17, we are at y=0, but if we could be at higher y earlier, but we can't.\n\nPerhaps we can reach y=9 at an earlier turn by not going all the way down, but we have to avoid being on 1-8 at turn 16 and 17.\n\nBut since we must be at 0 or 9, and 9 impossible, must be 0.\n\nSo no.\n\nThus, minimal H is 13.\n\nSequence as above.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 2)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 13\\) is 13. This sequence avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by ensuring the player is at \\(y = 0\\) (a safe position with no cars) during turns 16 and 17, when collisions would otherwise occur on any freeway \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n- At turns 16 and 17 (\\(\\Delta T = 3\\) and \\(\\Delta T = 4\\) from \\(t_1 = 13\\)), the car with initial span \\((-18, -29)\\) covers \\(x = 0\\) for all freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), leading to a collision if the player is on any of these freeways.\n- The player must be at \\(y = 0\\) or \\(y = 9\\) at turns 16 and 17 to avoid collision. However, reaching \\(y = 9\\) by turn 17 is impossible from \\(y = 2\\) in the available turns (maximum \\(y_{16} = 5\\) and \\(y_{17} \\leq 1\\)), so \\(y = 0\\) is the only feasible safe position.\n- From turn 13 to turn 16, actions are chosen to reach \\(y_{16} = 0\\) without violating \\(y \\geq 0\\).\n- At turn 17, \\(y_{17} = 0\\) is maintained with a stay action (S), as moving would risk collision or invalid position.\n- After turn 17, no collision risk exists, so the player moves up (U) every turn to reach \\(y = 9\\) at turn 26 (after action \\(a_{25}\\)).\n\nThe sequence of actions \\(\\{a_t\\}_{t=13}^{25}\\) is:\n\n- **Turn 13: S** (stay, \\(y_{14} = 2\\))\n- **Turn 14: D** (down, \\(y_{15} = 1\\))\n- **Turn 15: D** (down, \\(y_{16} = 0\\))\n- **Turn 16: S** (stay, \\(y_{17} = 0\\)) – safe at \\(y = 0\\)\n- **Turn 17: U** (up, \\(y_{18} = 1\\))\n- **Turn 18: U** (up, \\(y_{19} = 2\\))\n- **Turn 19: U** (up, \\(y_{20} = 3\\))\n- **Turn 20: U** (up, \\(y_{21} = 4\\))\n- **Turn 21: U** (up, \\(y_{22} = 5\\))\n- **Turn 22: U** (up, \\(y_{23} = 6\\))\n- **Turn 23: U** (up, \\(y_{24} = 7\\))\n- **Turn 24: U** (up, \\(y_{25} = 8\\))\n- **Turn 25: U** (up, \\(y_{26} = 9\\)) – goal reached\n\nThis sequence achieves \\(y_{26} = 9\\) in \\(H = 13\\) actions, the minimum possible given the constraints.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 13: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 14: \\text{ D} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 15: \\text{ D} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 16: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 17: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 18: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 19: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 20: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 21: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 22: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 23: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 24: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 25: \\text{ U} \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,2) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t₁ = 14, and I'm at y=2.\n\nFirst, I should understand the car movements. All cars are moving right with speed 6. For each car, the span is given as (head, tail, direction, speed). Since they're all moving right, the head is the right end, and tail is left, I think? Let me read carefully.\n\nFor right-moving cars, it says: Span(t₁) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t₁), h + s(T-t₁)]\n\nIn the table, it's listed as (head h, tail τ, direction, speed). For right-moving, head is the front, so if it's moving right, head should be the right end? But in the span definition, for right-moving, it says Span(t₁) = [τ, h], and then moves to [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT].\n\nIn the car state, it's written as (head, tail, direction, speed). Let's see an example: for freeway 1, (-12, -23, right, 6). Since direction is right, and head is -12, tail is -23. -12 is greater than -23, so if it's moving right, head should be the larger x-value, I assume x is horizontal.\n\nThe grid is 2D, but only y matters for position, x is for the cars on freeways. Player is always at x=0, I think? The player position is given as (0, y), so x=0 fixed, and y from 0 to 9.\n\nCollision occurs if at turn T, y_T = k, and for some car on freeway k, 0 is in Span(T), meaning the car covers x=0 at that turn.\n\nPlayer is at (0, y_t), so when y_t = k, and x=0 is occupied by a car on freeway k at turn t, then collision.\n\nNow, for car movement: let's define for each car.\n\nGiven at t₁=14.\n\nFor a right-moving car with head h, tail τ, speed s, at time T, span is [τ + s(T-14), h + s(T-14)]\n\nSimilarly for left, but all are right-moving here.\n\nIn the span definition, for right-moving: Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t₁), h + s(T-t₁)]\n\nBut in the input, for each car, it's (head, tail, dir, speed). For right-moving, head should be the end in the direction of motion, so for right, head is larger x, tail smaller.\n\nIn freeway 1: (-12, -23, right, 6). Head is -12, tail is -23. Since moving right, at T, the tail becomes τ + s(T-14), head h + s(T-14).\n\nτ = -23, h = -12.\n\nSo Span(T) = [-23 + 6(T-14), -12 + 6(T-14)]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, collision when y_T = k and 0 in Span(T) for some car on k.\n\nAlso, note that when moving, at turn T, you are on y_T, and you check collision only for that freeway at that turn.\n\nThe note says: if you move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you are not on y_{T+1} at turn T, so no collision with cars on y_{T+1} at turn T.\n\nBut at turn T, you are on y_T, so you only care about cars on y_T at that turn.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=2 to y=9, so I need to move up 7 units. Each up move increases y by 1, down decreases, stay same. So minimum moves would be 7 up moves, but I have to avoid the freeways when cars are at x=0.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, I assume, no cars, since cars on y=1 to 8.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are not freeways, so no cars, so safe.\n\nPlayer starts at (0,2), which is on freeway y=2, but at turn t₁=14, we need to check if there is collision at turn 14 with cars on y=2.\n\nThe task is to start from turn t₁, and find actions for t from t₁ to t₁+H-1, ending at y=9.\n\nAt turn t₁, we are given position, and we need to take action for turn t₁ to go to turn t₁+1, etc.\n\nLet me denote the turns starting from t=14.\n\nAt t=14, position y=2.\n\nI need to find actions a_t for t=14,15,... up to some H where y_{t+H-1} =9? Let's see the sequence.\n\nThe sequence is {a_{t₁ + t} for t=0 to H-1, so a_{t₁} to a_{t₁ + H-1}, and after H actions, at turn t₁ + H, position should be (0,9)? Let's clarify.\n\nPlayer update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, based on a_t.\n\nSo at turn t, after action a_t, we move to y_{t+1}.\n\nThe state at turn t is before action, I think.\n\nTypically, at the start of turn t, position is y_t, then we choose action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nThen at turn t, we are at y_t, and we might collide if on freeway and car covers x=0.\n\nFor turn T, collision if y_T = k for k=1-8, and 0 in Span(T) for some car on k.\n\nThen, after action a_T, we go to y_{T+1}.\n\nThe sequence ends when we reach y=9, I think at some turn.\n\nThe minimal H such that y_{t₁ + H -1} =9? Let's read.\n\n\"minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t₁ + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAnd y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t based on a_t.\n\nSo after H actions, we are at turn t₁ + H, with y_{t₁ + H} = y_{t₁} + sum of Δy from t=t₁ to t₁+H-1.\n\nWe start at t₁, y_{t₁} =2.\n\nAfter actions a_{t₁} to a_{t₁+H-1}, we have y_{t₁+H} = y_{t₁} + Δy_{t₁} + ... + Δy_{t₁+H-1} = 9.\n\nSo y_{t₁+H} =9.\n\nAnd H is the number of actions, so number of turns from t₁ to t₁+H-1, so H actions over H turns, ending at turn t₁+H.\n\nMinimal H means minimal number of actions to reach y=9.\n\nSince we need to go from 2 to 9, delta y=7, so if no obstacles, H=7 with all U actions.\n\nBut with cars, we might need to wait or detour.\n\nNow, y can be from 0 to 9, so we can go down to y=0 if needed, but that might cost extra moves.\n\nSince we need to go up, probably better to go up directly if possible.\n\nFirst, I need to know for each freeway y=1 to 8, when cars cover x=0.\n\nFor each freeway, there are multiple cars, so I need to find when at least one car has 0 in its span.\n\nFor a given freeway k, at turn T, collision if for some car on k, 0 in [τ + s(T-14), h + s(T-14)] for right-moving cars.\n\nSince all cars are right-moving with speed 6.\n\nLet me list all cars for each freeway.\n\nFrom the table:\n\nFreeway 1: two cars: car A: h=-12, τ=-23, s=6\n\ncar B: h=36, τ=25, s=6? Head and tail, for car B: (36,25,right,6), but 36>25, so head=36, tail=25? That can't be right because tail should be left, head right.\n\nFor right-moving, head should be larger x, tail smaller.\n\nIn car A: head=-12, tail=-23, so tail=-23 < head=-12, so span from -23 to -12.\n\nAt T, span [ -23 + 6(T-14), -12 + 6(T-14) ]\n\nSimilarly car B: head=36, tail=25? But tail=25, head=36, so if moving right, tail is left end, head right end, so span [25,36] at t=14.\n\nThen at T, [25 + 6(T-14), 36 + 6(T-14)]\n\nSimilarly for other freeways.\n\nBut for freeway 1, cars: (-12,-23,right,6) and (36,25,right,6)\n\n(36,25,right,6) — tail=25, head=36, so span [25,36] at t=14.\n\nBut 25 to 36, so at x=0, 0 < 25, so not covered, and car A from -23 to -12, which includes negative x, so at T, when the span includes 0.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFirst, for each car, find when it covers x=0.\n\nFor a car, 0 in [τ + 6(T-14), h + 6(T-14)]\n\nSo let Δt = T - 14, so for car, 0 in [τ + 6Δt, h + 6Δt]\n\nSince h > τ for right-moving, we have τ + 6Δt ≤ 0 ≤ h + 6Δt\n\nThen we can solve for Δt.\n\nBut since the span is continuous, 0 is covered when τ + 6Δt ≤ 0 ≤ h + 6Δt\n\nWhich is equivalent to -h/6 ≤ Δt ≤ -τ/6? Let's see.\n\nFrom τ + 6Δt ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ h + 6Δt\n\nFirst inequality: τ + 6Δt ≤ 0 ⇒ 6Δt ≤ -τ ⇒ Δt ≤ -τ/6\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ h + 6Δt ⇒ 6Δt ≥ -h ⇒ Δt ≥ -h/6\n\nSo Δt ≥ -h/6 and Δt ≤ -τ/6\n\nSince τ < h, -τ/6 > -h/6, so the interval is [ ceil(-h/6), floor(-τ/6) ] or something? But Δt integer, T integer.\n\nΔt is integer, T integer, turn-based.\n\nSo for each car, the times when it covers x=0 are Δt such that max( ceil(-h/6), something) let's compute numerically.\n\nFirst, for freeway 1:\n\nCar A: h = -12, τ = -23, s=6\n\nΔt ≥ -(-12)/6 = 12/6 = 2\n\nΔt ≤ -(-23)/6 = 23/6 ≈ 3.833, so Δt ≤ 3 since integer? -τ/6 = -(-23)/6 = 23/6 = 3.833, so Δt ≤ floor(23/6)? Let's see.\n\nΔt ≥ -h/6 = -(-12)/6 = 12/6 = 2\n\nΔt ≤ -τ/6 = -(-23)/6 = 23/6 ≈ 3.833, so since Δt integer, Δt ≤ 3? 23/6=3.833, floor is 3, but:\n\n0 ≤ h + 6Δt, h=-12, so 0 ≤ -12 + 6Δt ⇒ 6Δt ≥ 12 ⇒ Δt ≥ 2\n\nτ + 6Δt ≤ 0, τ=-23, so -23 + 6Δt ≤ 0 ⇒ 6Δt ≤ 23 ⇒ Δt ≤ 23/6 ≈ 3.833, so Δt ≤ 3 since integer? Δt=4: 6*4=24>23, so -23 +24=1 >0, so τ +6Δt = -23+24=1>0, which violates τ +6Δt ≤0? No.\n\nτ +6Δt ≤0 for the left inequality.\n\nτ +6Δt ≤0 ⇒ -23 +6Δt ≤0 ⇒ 6Δt ≤23 ⇒ Δt ≤ 23/6 =3.833, so for integer Δt, Δt ≤3\n\nSimilarly, 0 ≤ h +6Δt ⇒ 0 ≤ -12 +6Δt ⇒ 12 ≤6Δt ⇒ Δt ≥2\n\nAlso, for Δt=2: τ+6*2= -23+12= -11 ≤0, h+6*2= -12+12=0, so 0≤0, which is included? 0 ≤ h+6Δt, at equality, 0=0, so x=0 is covered.\n\nSimilarly Δt=3: τ+6*3= -23+18= -5 ≤0, h+6*3= -12+18=6, 0≤6, yes.\n\nΔt=4: τ+6*4= -23+24=1 >0, so τ+6Δt=1>0, but we need τ+6Δt ≤0 for the span to cover left of 0? No.\n\nThe span is [τ+6Δt, h+6Δt], and we need τ+6Δt ≤ 0 ≤ h+6Δt\n\nFor Δt=4: τ+6Δt = -23+24=1, h+6Δt= -12+24=12, so [1,12], 0 not in [1,12] since 1>0, so 0 not covered.\n\nSimilarly, Δt=1: τ+6*1= -23+6= -17 ≤0, h+6*1= -12+6= -6, 0 ≤ -6? 0 >= -6? 0 ≤ h+6Δt is 0 ≤ -6? -6 <0, so false. So not covered.\n\nSo for car A, covers x=0 at Δt=2 and Δt=3.\n\nNow car B on freeway 1: h=36, τ=25, s=6\n\nΔt ≥ -h/6 = -36/6 = -6\n\nΔt ≤ -τ/6 = -25/6 ≈ -4.166, so Δt ≤ -5? Since integer.\n\nCompute:\n\nτ+6Δt ≤0: 25 +6Δt ≤0 ⇒ 6Δt ≤ -25 ⇒ Δt ≤ -25/6 ≈ -4.166, so Δt ≤ -5\n\n0 ≤ h+6Δt: 0 ≤36 +6Δt ⇒ 6Δt ≥ -36 ⇒ Δt ≥ -6\n\nBut Δt ≤ -τ/6 = -25/6 ≈ -4.166, so Δt ≤ -5\n\nΔt ≥ -6 and Δt ≤ -5? Δt ≤ -4.166, so Δt <= -5 since integer? -4.166, floor is -5? Δt integer, Δt ≤ floor(-4.166) = -5? floor of -4.166 is -5? No, floor is towards -inf, so floor(-4.166) = -5, yes.\n\n-25/6 = -4.166, so Δt ≤ -4.166, so since Δt integer, Δt ≤ -5? -5 < -4.166, yes, but let's check values.\n\nΔt ≥ -6: 0 ≤ h+6Δt =36 +6Δt, so for Δt= -6: 36 +6*(-6)=36-36=0, so 0≤0, covered.\n\nΔt= -5: 36 +6*(-5)=36-30=6>0, τ+6Δt=25+6*(-5)=25-30= -5 ≤0, so [ -5,6], 0 in it.\n\nΔt= -4: τ+6Δt=25+6*(-4)=25-24=1 >0, so [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, Δt= -6: [τ+6*(-6), h+6*(-6)] = [25-36, 36-36] = [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nSo for car B, covers at Δt= -6 and Δt= -5.\n\nBut Δt = T - 14, so for T=14, Δt=0, which is not in -6 or -5, so at T=14, no cover from car B.\n\nFor freeway 1, at T=14, car A does not cover (Δt=0, not 2 or 3), car B at Δt= -6,-5, T=8 or 9, not 14.\n\nSo at T=14, no car on freeway 1 covers x=0? But there are two cars, but at T=14, let's compute span.\n\nCar A at T=14: [τ, h] = [-23, -12], so x from -23 to -12, 0 not in.\n\nCar B: [25,36], 0 not in.\n\nSo yes, at T=14, freeway 1 is clear at x=0.\n\nBut we need for future turns.\n\nNow back to collision times for freeway 1.\n\nFrom car A, covers at Δt=2,3 → T=16,17\n\nCar B covers at Δt=-6,-5 → T=8,9 which are before t=14, so not relevant for T>=14.\n\nSo for freeway 1, cars cover x=0 only at T=16 and T=17 from car A.\n\nCar B at T=8,9, past.\n\nNow freeway 2: same as freeway 1? \"2 | (-12, -23, right, 6), (36, 25, right, 6) |\" same as freeway 1.\n\nIn the table, freeway 2 has same cars: (-12,-23,right,6) and (36,25,right,6)\n\nSimilarly freeway 3 and 4 same.\n\nFreeway 5: three cars: (-12,-23,right,6), (24,13,right,6), (60,49,right,6)\n\nSimilarly freeway 6,7,8 same.\n\nLet me list for each freeway the cars that can cover x=0 for T>=14.\n\nFirst, for a car like (-12,-23,right,6), as above, covers at Δt=2,3 → T=16,17\n\nSimilarly, car (36,25,right,6): covers at Δt= -6,-5 → T=8,9, past.\n\nNow car (24,13,right,6): head=24, tail=13, s=6\n\nΔt ≥ -h/6 = -24/6 = -4\n\nΔt ≤ -τ/6 = -13/6 ≈ -2.166, so Δt ≤ -3? Since integer.\n\nCompute:\n\nτ+6Δt ≤0: 13 +6Δt ≤0 ⇒ 6Δt ≤ -13 ⇒ Δt ≤ -13/6 ≈ -2.166, so Δt ≤ -3\n\n0 ≤ h+6Δt: 0 ≤24 +6Δt ⇒ 6Δt ≥ -24 ⇒ Δt ≥ -4\n\nSo Δt ≥ -4 and Δt ≤ -3? Δt ≤ -2.166, so Δt <= -3.\n\nΔt >= -4\n\nSo Δt= -4, -3\n\nFor Δt= -4: τ+6*(-4)=13-24= -11 ≤0, h+6*(-4)=24-24=0, so 0 in\n\nΔt= -3: τ+6*(-3)=13-18= -5 ≤0, h+6*(-3)=24-18=6, 0 in\n\nΔt= -2: τ+6*(-2)=13-12=1>0, h+6*(-2)=24-12=12, [1,12] not include 0.\n\nSo covers at Δt= -4,-3 → T=10,11, past.\n\nSimilarly, car (60,49,right,6): head=60, tail=49\n\nΔt ≥ -60/6 = -10\n\nΔt ≤ -49/6 ≈ -8.166, so Δt ≤ -9? Compute.\n\nτ+6Δt ≤0: 49 +6Δt ≤0 ⇒ 6Δt ≤ -49 ⇒ Δt ≤ -49/6 ≈ -8.166, so Δt ≤ -9\n\n0 ≤ h+6Δt: 0 ≤60 +6Δt ⇒ 6Δt ≥ -60 ⇒ Δt ≥ -10\n\nSo Δt= -10, -9\n\nCovers at T=4,5, past.\n\nSo for freeways with only two cars like y=1,2,3,4, only the first type car covers at T=16,17.\n\nFor y=5,6,7,8, there is also (24,13,right,6) but it covers at T=10,11, past, so only the (-12,-23,right,6) covers at T=16,17 for all freeways.\n\ny=5 has three cars: (-12,-23,right,6), (24,13,right,6), (60,49,right,6)\n\nBut (24,13) covers at T=10,11, past; (60,49) at T=4,5 past; so only (-12,-23) at T=16,17.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo for every freeway y=1 to 8, there is a car that covers x=0 at T=16 and T=17.\n\nSpecifically, for each k=1 to 8, there is a car with head=-12, tail=-23, speed=6, covering at T=16 and 17.\n\nAnd no other times for T>=14, except past times.\n\nFor y=1 to 4, only that car, for y=5-8, also other cars but they covered in past.\n\nSo for all freeways, at T=16 and T=17, x=0 is occupied, so if player is on any freeway y=1-8 at turn 16 or 17, collision.\n\nAt other times, for T>=14, except T=16,17, x=0 should be clear for all freeways, since no other cars cover it.\n\nFor example, at T=14, as we saw, no cover.\n\nT=15: for car (-12,-23,right,6), at Δt=1: τ+6*1= -23+6= -17, h+6*1= -12+6= -6, span [-17,-6], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly other cars not cover.\n\nT=18: Δt=4, span [-23+24, -12+24] = [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly for other cars, all not cover for T!=16,17.\n\nT=16: Δt=2, span [-23+12, -12+12] = [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nT=17: [-23+18, -12+18] = [-5,6], 0 included.\n\nSo yes, for all freeways y=1 to 8, at exactly T=16 and T=17, x=0 is occupied by a car, so player must not be on any freeway at those turns.\n\nAt other times, it should be safe to be on freeway, except we need to avoid when moving, but since we are only concerned with position at turn T for collision, and action determines next position.\n\nNow, player starts at t=14, y=2.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nThe dangerous turns are t=16 and t=17, when we must not be on y=1 to 8.\n\nAt t=16 and t=17, player must be at y=0 or y=9 to avoid collision.\n\nBut y=9 is the goal, so if we can be at y=9 by t=16 or t=17, that would be fine, but we need to get there.\n\nMinimal moves: from y=2 to y=9, need +7, so at least 7 up moves.\n\nNow, turns: start at t=14, y=2.\n\nAfter each action, we move to next turn.\n\nLet me denote the position at turn t.\n\nAt t=14: y=2\n\nWe choose a_{14}, which determines y_{15}\n\nThen at t=15: y_{15}, and we might collide if on freeway and car at x=0, but at t=15, no car at x=0 for any freeway, as above.\n\nSimilarly, t=16: if on freeway, collision.\n\nt=17: same.\n\nt=18: safe, etc.\n\nWe need to be at y=9 at some turn, say after H actions, at turn t=14+H.\n\ny_{14+H} =9.\n\nH minimal.\n\nSince we must avoid being on y=1-8 at t=16 and t=17.\n\nt=16 and t=17 are critical.\n\nNow, possible strategies:\n\n- Get to y=9 before t=16, so by t=15 or earlier.\n\n- Or stay at y=0 during t=16 and t=17.\n\n- Or be at y=9 at t=16 or t=17.\n\nBut y=9 is safe.\n\nSince we start at y=2, and need to go up, going down to y=0 might cost extra moves.\n\nFirst, let's see if we can reach y=9 before t=16.\n\nt=14: y=2\n\nAfter a_{14}, y_{15} = y_{14} + Δy\n\nSimilarly, after a_{15}, y_{16}, etc.\n\nTo reach y=9 by t=15, meaning y_{15}=9.\n\nBut at t=14, y=2, so from t=14 to t=15, we move with a_{14}, so y_{15} = 2 + Δy_{14}\n\nΔy_{14} can be +1, -1, 0, so y_{15} can be 1,2,3.\n\nCannot be 9, obviously. So impossible to be at y=9 at t=15.\n\nSimilarly, at t=16: y_{16} = y_{15} + Δy_{15}\n\ny_{15} <=3, so y_{16} <=4, cannot be 9.\n\nAt t=17: y_{17} = y_{16} + Δy_{16}, y_{16} <=4, so y_{17} <=5, not 9.\n\nAt t=18: y_{18} = y_{17} + Δy_{17}, y_{17} <=5, so y_{18} <=6, not 9.\n\nWe need to go step by step.\n\nStart at t=14, y=2.\n\nAfter a_{14}, y_{15} = 2 + U, D, or S, so 3,1, or 2.\n\nNow, to reach y=9, we need to increase y.\n\nThe earliest we can be at y=9 is if we go up every turn.\n\ny_{15} = 3 (if a_{14}=U)\n\ny_{16} = 4 (if a_{15}=U)\n\ny_{17} = 5 (a_{16}=U)\n\ny_{18} = 6 (a_{17}=U)\n\ny_{19} = 7 (a_{18}=U)\n\ny_{20} = 8 (a_{19}=U)\n\ny_{21} = 9 (a_{20}=U)\n\nSo at t=21, y=9.\n\nBut at t=16 and t=17, we are on freeway: at t=16, y=4, which is freeway, and cars at x=0, collision.\n\nSimilarly t=17, y=5, collision.\n\nSo we need to avoid being on freeway at t=16 and t=17.\n\nWe can either:\n\n- Be at y=0 at those turns.\n\n- Or at y=9.\n\nBut at t=16 and t=17, we cannot be at y=9 yet, as above, since we start from low y.\n\ny=0 is possible, but we need to go down.\n\nSince we have to wait during t=16 and t=17, we might as well stay at y=0 during that time to save moves, but going down costs moves.\n\nWe need to plan the path.\n\nThe critical period is t=16 and t=17, we must be at y=0 or y=9.\n\nBut y=9 not reachable by then, so must be at y=0 at t=16 and t=17.\n\nAt t=16 and t=17, position y_t must be 0 or 9, but 9 impossible, so y_t=0 for t=16 and t=17.\n\ny_t is position at turn t.\n\nSo y_{16} = 0 and y_{17} = 0.\n\nNow, y_{17} = y_{16} + Δy_{16}, so if y_{16}=0, then y_{17} = Δy_{16}, which can be -1,0,1.\n\nBut we need y_{17}=0, so Δy_{16} must be 0 or if y_{16}=0, Δy_{16}=S or D, but D would make y_{17}=-1, not possible since y>=0.\n\ny_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, and y in [0,9], so if y_t=0, a_t=D would make y_{t+1}= -1, invalid, so not allowed, I assume the player cannot go below 0 or above 9, so action is constrained.\n\nSimilarly, at y=9, cannot go up.\n\nSo at y_t=0, possible actions: U to y=1, S to y=0, D not possible.\n\nAt y=9, D to y=8, S to y=9, U not possible.\n\nNow, back to y_{17}=0.\n\nSince y_{17} must be 0, and y_{17} = y_{16} + Δy_{16}\n\nIf y_{16} = 0, then y_{17} = Δy_{16}, so to have y_{17}=0, must have Δy_{16}=0, i.e., S.\n\nIf y_{16} =1, then y_{17} =1 + Δy_{16}, to be 0, must have Δy_{16} = -1, i.e., D.\n\nSimilarly, other cases.\n\nBut we also need y_{16}=0 or 9, but 9 impossible, so y_{16}=0.\n\nThen y_{17} must be 0, and since y_{16}=0, we must have a_{16}=S, so y_{17}=0.\n\nIf y_{16} were not 0, but we need it to be 0 to avoid collision.\n\nSo y_{16}=0 and y_{17}=0.\n\nNow, y_{16} = y_{15} + Δy_{15}\n\ny_{15} can be from 0 to 9.\n\ny_{16} =0.\n\nSo if y_{15} =0, then y_{16} = Δy_{15}, must be 0, so a_{15}=S.\n\nIf y_{15}=1, then y_{16} =1 + Δy_{15}, must be 0, so Δy_{15}= -1, a_{15}=D.\n\nSimilarly, if y_{15}=2, y_{16}=2 + Δy_{15}=0, so Δy_{15}= -2, impossible since |Δy|=1 or 0.\n\nSimilarly, higher not possible.\n\nSo y_{15} must be 0 or 1.\n\nIf y_{15}=0, then a_{15}=S to y_{16}=0\n\nIf y_{15}=1, then a_{15}=D to y_{16}=0\n\nNow, similarly, y_{17} = y_{16} + Δy_{16} = 0 + Δy_{16}\n\nAnd y_{17}=0, so Δy_{16} must be 0, so a_{16}=S.\n\nNow, we have y_{16}=0 and y_{17}=0.\n\nNow, at t=14, y=2.\n\nWe need to get to y_{15}, which must be 0 or 1.\n\ny_{15} = y_{14} + Δy_{14} = 2 + Δy_{14}\n\nSo if y_{15} must be 0 or 1, then from y=2, with one move:\n\nIf a_{14}=D, y_{15}=1\n\nIf a_{14}=S, y_{15}=2, not 0 or 1.\n\nIf a_{14}=U, y_{15}=3, not 0 or 1.\n\nSo only possible with a_{14}=D, then y_{15}=1.\n\nThen, since y_{15}=1, to have y_{16}=0, we need a_{15}=D, so y_{16}=1 + (-1) =0\n\nThen a_{16}=S, y_{17}=0\n\nNow, after t=17, we need to go to y=9.\n\nAt t=17, y=0.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\ny=0 to y=9, need +9, so at least 9 up moves.\n\nBut we can start from t=17, position y=0.\n\nAfter a_{17}, y_{18}, etc.\n\nThe actions are from t=14 to t=14+H-1, and y_{14+H}=9.\n\nCurrently, we have:\n\nt=14: a_{14}=D, y_{15}=1\n\nt=15: a_{15}=D, y_{16}=0\n\nt=16: a_{16}=S, y_{17}=0\n\nNow at t=17, y=0, we need to go to y=9.\n\nWe can use up moves.\n\nEach U increases y by 1.\n\nSo from y=0 to y=9, need 9 U actions.\n\nBut we might need to wait or something, but since after t=17, no critical times, and freeways are safe except when cars, but only t=16,17 dangerous, and after that, all clear, so we can go directly up.\n\nBut at each turn, when on freeway, need to check if car at x=0, but after t=17, for T>=18, no car covers x=0, as we saw earlier, since only at T=16,17.\n\nFor example, at T=18, for car (-12,-23,right,6), span [ -23+6*4, -12+6*4] = [-23+24, -12+24] = [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly other cars, all not cover x=0 for T>17.\n\nSo for T>=18, all freeways are safe at x=0.\n\nSo we can be on any freeway without problem.\n\nThus from t=17, y=0, we can do all U actions to reach y=9 quickly.\n\ny_{17}=0\n\na_{17}=U, y_{18}=1\n\na_{18}=U, y_{19}=2\n\n...\n\nUp to a_{25}=U, y_{26}=9? Let's see:\n\nStart from y_{17}=0\n\nAfter a_{17}: y_{18} = 0 + U =1\n\na_{18}: y_{19}=1+U=2\n\na_{19}: y_{20}=3\n\na_{20}: y_{21}=4\n\na_{21}: y_{22}=5\n\na_{22}: y_{23}=6\n\na_{23}: y_{24}=7\n\na_{24}: y_{25}=8\n\na_{25}: y_{26}=9\n\nSo at turn t=26, y=9.\n\nNow, total actions: from t=14 to t=25, that's 12 actions: a_{14} to a_{25}, 12 steps.\n\nt=14: a_{14}\n\nt=15: a_{15}\n\n...\n\nt=25: a_{25}\n\nNumber of actions: from t=14 to t=25 inclusive, that's 12 actions.\n\nIndices: t from 14 to 25, that's 12 turns: 14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25.\n\nBut y_{26} =9, after 12 actions.\n\nH=12.\n\nBut we might do better? Because we went down to y=1 at t=15, then to 0 at t=16, stayed at 0 at t=17, then up.\n\nBut we started at y=2, went down, which is away from goal.\n\nPerhaps we can be at y=0 at t=16 and t=17, but start going up earlier.\n\nAt t=14, y=2.\n\nIf we go up to y=3 at t=15, but y_{15} must be 0 or 1 to reach y_{16}=0, as earlier.\n\ny_{15} must be 0 or 1, so we cannot be at y=3 at t=15; we must be at y=0 or 1.\n\nWith a_{14}, from y=2, only D gets to y=1, S to y=2, U to y=3, none to 0 except with multiple moves, but only one move to t=15.\n\nSo only possibility is a_{14}=D to y_{15}=1.\n\nThen a_{15}=D to y_{16}=0.\n\nThen a_{16}=S to y_{17}=0.\n\nThen up to 9.\n\nWe could have stayed at y=0 longer, but that might not help.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps we can reach y=9 after t=17, but with fewer moves by not going down.\n\nFor example, if we can be at a high y before t=16, but we can't reach high y early.\n\nt=14 y=2, t=15 y<=3, t=16 y<=4, all less than 9.\n\nSo we must avoid freeways at t=16 and t=17 by being at y=0.\n\nThe only way is to go down to y=0 at t=16 and stay there at t=17.\n\nThen go up.\n\nBut in the process, we used two down moves, which are extra, since we need net +7 to go from 2 to 9.\n\nIn the sequence: from t=14 y=2 to t=17 y=0, that's net -2, with two down moves.\n\nThen from y=0 to y=9, +9, with 9 up moves.\n\nTotal actions: 2 down + 9 up, but we have a stay at t=16.\n\nActions: a_{14}=D (down), a_{15}=D (down), a_{16}=S (stay), then a_{17} to a_{25} U, that's 9 U.\n\nSo actions: D,D,S, and then 9 U.\n\nNumber of actions: 12, from t=14 to t=25, y_{26}=9.\n\nH=12.\n\nBut can we reach earlier?\n\nAfter t=17, we go up, but we start from y=0.\n\nSince we need to be at y=0 at t=16 and t=17, and at t=17 we are at y=0, we can start going up immediately at t=17.\n\na_{17}=U to y_{18}=1, etc.\n\nPerhaps we can be at a higher position at t=17.\n\nBut at t=17, we must be at y=0, as established.\n\ny_{17}=0.\n\nNo choice.\n\nAnother thought: at t=16, we must be at y=0, but at t=17, if we could be at y=9, but impossible.\n\nSo no.\n\nPerhaps we don't need to be at y=0 both turns, but since we have to avoid collision, we must not be on freeway, so y=0 or 9, but 9 not possible, so y=0 both.\n\nIn the sequence above, we have a_{16}=S, which is a stay, but we could move up at t=17 if possible, but at t=17 we are at y=0, and we need to stay or go up, but going up is fine after.\n\nBut in terms of minimizing H, staying or moving doesn't affect the net displacement, but since we have to reach y=9, moving up is better.\n\nIn our sequence, at t=17, we are at y=0, we go up.\n\nBut let's confirm the turns.\n\nt=14: y=2, action a_{14}\n\nt=15: y= y_{14} + Δy_{14}, with a_{14}\n\nAt t=15, position y_{15}, which must be evaluated for collision.\n\nSimilarly for each turn.\n\nIn our case:\n\nAt t=14: y=2, freeway y=2. At t=14, cars on y=2: as above, at t=14, no car at x=0, so safe.\n\nAction a_{14}=D, so y_{15}=2 + (-1) =1\n\nAt t=15: y=1, freeway y=1. At t=15, for freeway 1, cars: car (-12,-23), at Δt=1, span [-17,-6], 0 not in; car (36,25) not cover. So safe.\n\nAction a_{15}=D, so y_{16}=1 + (-1)=0\n\nAt t=16: y=0, not freeway, safe. (y=0 safe)\n\nAction a_{16}=S, so y_{17}=0 +0 =0\n\nAt t=17: y=0, safe.\n\nAction a_{17}=U, y_{18}=0+1=1\n\nAt t=18: y=1, freeway. At t=18, for freeway 1, car (-12,-23), Δt=4, span [ -23+24, -12+24] = [1,12], 0 not in. Other cars not cover. So safe.\n\nSimilarly for other freeways, all safe at t=18.\n\nThen continue up: a_{18}=U, y_{19}=2\n\n...\nUp to a_{25}=U, y_{26}=9\n\nAt t=26: y=9, not freeway, safe, and we reached.\n\nNow, actions from a_{14} to a_{25}, 12 actions.\n\nBut can we reduce H?\n\nNotice that from t=17 y=0 to y=9, it takes 9 actions to reach y_{26}=9.\n\nBut we used actions at t=14 and t=15 to go down, and t=16 to stay.\n\nThe stay at t=16 might be wasteful; we could go up earlier, but we can't because we need to be at y=0.\n\nAt t=17, we are at y=0, and we go up.\n\nBut after t=17, all safe, so we can go directly.\n\nPerhaps we can reach y=9 faster by not going all the way down.\n\nBut we must be at y=0 at t=16 and t=17.\n\nAt t=17, if we go up, we leave y=0.\n\nBut at t=17, we must be at y=0 to avoid collision, since if on freeway, collision.\n\nIn the sequence, at t=17 we are at y=0.\n\nThen we go up at t=17 action.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps we can be at y=9 at t=17 or earlier, but impossible as calculated.\n\nMaybe we can use the fact that at t=16 and t=17, if we are moving, but the collision is based on position at turn t.\n\nThe note: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T\"\n\nBut at turn T, you are on y_T, so you only check cars on y_T.\n\nWhen you move, at turn T, you are on y_T, take action to go to y_{T+1}.\n\nIf y_{T+1} ≠ y_T, at turn T, you are not on y_{T+1}, so if cars on y_{T+1} at turn T cover x=0, no collision because you are not on that freeway at that turn.\n\nBut in this case, for our problem, at t=16 and t=17, we need to not be on freeway, so y_t must be 0 or 9.\n\nNo other way.\n\nPerhaps we can be at y=0 only at t=16, and at t=17 be at y=9, but impossible.\n\nSo the sequence above seems necessary.\n\nBut let's see if we can save a move.\n\nFor example, at t=16, we are at y=0, we do a_{16}=S to stay, but we could do a_{16}=U to go to y=1 at t=17.\n\nBut at t=17, if y=1, which is freeway, and t=17 is dangerous, so collision.\n\nWe must have y_{17}=0 or 9.\n\nIf y_{17}=1, collision.\n\nSo we cannot; we must stay at y=0 at t=17.\n\nThus a_{16} must be S if y_{16}=0.\n\nIf we could be at y=9, but no.\n\nSo the sequence is fixed until t=17.\n\nThen from there, we go up.\n\nBut we start from y=2 at t=14, go to y=1 at t=15, y=0 at t=16, stay y=0 at t=17, then up to y=9 at t=26.\n\nTotal turns from start to end: t=14 to t=26, but H is number of actions.\n\nActions: t=14 to t=25, 12 actions, y_{26}=9.\n\nSince we need to reach y=9, and we have net +7 from start, but we went down to 0, so extra 2 down, and one stay, so total moves: 2 down, 1 stay, 9 up, net +7, but 12 actions.\n\nIf we could go up immediately after, but we can't.\n\nAnother thought: at t=14, instead of going down, we could go up, but then y_{15}=3, which is not 0 or 1, so we cannot reach y_{16}=0 in one move from y=3.\n\nFor example, if a_{14}=U, y_{15}=3\n\nThen at t=15, y=3, safe (t=15 safe)\n\nThen to reach y_{16}=0, but from y=3 to y=0 in one move? Impossible, |Δy|<=1, so y_{16} can be 2,3,4, not 0.\n\nThus we cannot be at y_{16}=0 if we go up at t=14.\n\nIf we stay, a_{14}=S, y_{15}=2, then from there, to y_{16}=0, need a_{15}=D, y_{16}=1, not 0; or a_{15}=D from y=2 to y=1, not to 0.\n\nFrom y=2 at t=15, y_{16} = 2 + Δy_{15}, so 1,2,3, not 0.\n\nSo only way to reach y_{16}=0 is from y_{15}=0 or 1, and y_{15}=0 or 1 must come from y=2 with down, so a_{14}=D to y_{15}=1.\n\nThen a_{15}=D to y_{16}=0.\n\nNo other way.\n\nThus, the beginning is fixed: must go down to y=1 at t=15, then down to y=0 at t=16, then stay at y=0 at t=17.\n\nThen from t=17, go up to y=9.\n\nNow, to minimize H, we need to minimize the number of up moves, but we need exactly 9 up moves from y=0 to y=9, since no obstacles after.\n\nWe can do only U actions from t=17 onwards.\n\nBut t=17: we are at y=0, a_{17}=U to y_{18}=1\n\nThen U each turn up to a_{25}=U to y_{26}=9.\n\nCan we reach y=9 earlier?\n\nFor example, if at some point we can move faster, but no, each action changes y by at most 1.\n\nSo from y=0, it takes exactly 9 up actions to reach y=9.\n\nThus minimal H is 12: actions at t=14 to t=25.\n\nBut let's list the actions:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{14} = D\n\nTurn t_1 +1: a_{15} = D\n\nTurn t_1 +2: a_{16} = S  (t_1=14, so t_1+2=16)\n\nThen Turn t_1 +3: a_{17} = U\n\nt_1 +4: a_{18} = U\n\n...\n\nUp to a_{25}, which is t_1 +11, since t_1=14, t_1+11=25.\n\nt from t_1 to t_1 + H-1.\n\nH=12, so t from 14 to 14+11=25.\n\nActions: a_{14} to a_{25}\n\nThen y_{26} = y_{14 + 12} =9.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nTurn 14: a_{14} = D\n\nTurn 15: a_{15} = D\n\nTurn 16: a_{16} = S\n\nTurn 17: a_{17} = U\n\nTurn 18: a_{18} = U\n\nTurn 19: a_{19} = U\n\nTurn 20: a_{20} = U\n\nTurn 21: a_{21} = U\n\nTurn 22: a_{22} = U\n\nTurn 23: a_{23} = U\n\nTurn 24: a_{24} = U\n\nTurn 25: a_{25} = U\n\nThen at turn 26, y=9.\n\nBut we need to output the actions from t_1 to t_1+H-1, which is up to a_{25}.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 +1}\n\n...\n\nTurn t_1 + (H-1): a_{t_1 + H-1}\n\nWith H=12, t_1=14.\n\nBut is there a shorter way?\n\nPerhaps we can go up faster after t=17, but no.\n\nAnother idea: since at t=17 we are at y=0, and we need to be at y=9, but maybe we can start going up earlier, but we can't because at t=16 we must be at y=0 and stay or something.\n\nAt t=16, we are at y=0, we could do a_{16}=U to go to y=1 at t=17, but at t=17, y=1 is freeway, collision.\n\nNot possible.\n\nWe must do a_{16}=S to stay at y=0 for t=17.\n\nThus, I think H=12 is minimal.\n\nBut let's confirm the car states.\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 5 and 6,7,8, there are three cars, but as we saw, only the first one affects, and at t=16,17.\n\nFor example, freeway 5: cars (-12,-23,right,6), (24,13,right,6), (60,49,right,6)\n\n(24,13): head=24, tail=13, covers at T=10,11 as before.\n\nAt t=16, Δt=2, span: τ+6*2=13+12=25? τ=13, at T=16, Δt=2, span [13 + 12, 24 + 12]? No.\n\nSpan(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] = [13 + 6(16-14), 24 + 6(2)] = [13+12, 24+12] = [25,36], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, (60,49) at T=16, [49+12,60+12]=[61,72], not.\n\nOnly (-12,-23) at [ -23+12, -12+12]=[-11,0], 0 in.\n\nSimilarly at t=17.\n\nSo yes.\n\nTherefore, the minimal sequence is as above.\n\nBut in the action sequence, from t=17 to t=25, all U, that's 9 actions, plus t=14 D, t=15 D, t=16 S, total 12.\n\nPerhaps we can combine or something, but no.\n\nSince we need to be at y=0 at t=17, and we are, we go up.\n\nBut at t=17, after action, we go to y=18=1.\n\nBut we could have gone up at t=17 only if we were not at y=0, but we are.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nSo H=12.\n\nBut let's see if we can reach y=9 with fewer actions.\n\nSuppose we don't go down immediately.\n\nFor example, at t=14, we go up to y=3.\n\nThen at t=15, y=3, safe.\n\nBut then at t=16, we need y=0, but from y=3, we can go to y=2 at best, not 0, so we would be on freeway at t=16, collision.\n\nIf we go down at t=15, y_{16}=2, still freeway.\n\nNot possible.\n\nSimilarly, any other action leads to being on freeway at t=16 or not reaching y=0.\n\nThus, the only way is to go down to y=1 at t=15, then to y=0 at t=16, stay at t=17, then up.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 12.\n\nNow, for the answer, we need to output the sequence.\n\nt_1 = 14\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 14: D\n\nTurn 15: D\n\nTurn 16: S\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nTurn 20: U\n\nTurn 21: U\n\nTurn 22: U\n\nTurn 23: U\n\nTurn 24: U\n\nTurn 25: U\n\nIn the sequence, from turn 17 to 25, all U, which is 9 actions.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut in the answer format, it should be written with t_1.\n\nSince t_1 is given, we can write:\n\nTurn t_1: D\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: D\n\nTurn t_1 + 2: S\n\nTurn t_1 + 3: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 4: U\n\n...\n\nUp to Turn t_1 + 11: U\n\nBecause H=12, t from 0 to 11 relative to t_1.\n\n{ a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1 }\n\nSo for t=0: a_{t_1} = D\n\nt=1: a_{t_1 +1} = D\n\nt=2: a_{t_1 +2} = S\n\nt=3: a_{t_1 +3} = U\n\n...\n\nt=11: a_{t_1 +11} = U\n\nAnd t_1 +11 = 14+11=25.\n\nNow, in the output, we need to list each turn.\n\nSince from t=3 to t=11, all U, we can list them.\n\nBut in text, we write each line.\n\nNow, I think that's the answer.\n\nBut let's make sure about the car states.\n\nIn freeway 5,6,7,8, there is an extra car (24,13,right,6), but as we saw, it doesn't cover x=0 at T>=14, only at T=10,11, so fine.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=12 with the sequence above.\n</think>\nTo reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 2) at turn \\(t_1 = 14\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 12. The sequence of actions must ensure the player is not on any freeway (\\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\)) at turns 16 and 17, as cars cover \\(x = 0\\) on all freeways at these times, causing collisions. The only safe positions at turns 16 and 17 are \\(y = 0\\) or \\(y = 9\\), but \\(y = 9\\) is unreachable by turn 17 from the starting position. Thus, the player must be at \\(y = 0\\) at both turns 16 and 17.\n\nStarting from \\(y = 2\\) at turn 14:\n- At turn 14, moving down (\\(D\\)) to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 15.\n- At turn 15, moving down (\\(D\\)) to \\(y = 0\\) at turn 16.\n- At turn 16, staying (\\(S\\)) to remain at \\(y = 0\\) at turn 17.\n\nAfter turn 17, there are no collision risks, as cars do not cover \\(x = 0\\) for \\(T \\geq 18\\). From \\(y = 0\\) at turn 17, moving up (\\(U\\)) repeatedly for 9 turns reaches \\(y = 9\\) at turn 26.\n\nThe sequence of actions for turns \\(t_1\\) to \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 14\\) to \\(25\\) is:\n- \\(a_{14} = D\\): Move down to \\(y = 1\\).\n- \\(a_{15} = D\\): Move down to \\(y = 0\\).\n- \\(a_{16} = S\\): Stay to remain at \\(y = 0\\).\n- \\(a_{17} = U\\): Move up to \\(y = 1\\).\n- \\(a_{18} = U\\): Move up to \\(y = 2\\).\n- \\(a_{19} = U\\): Move up to \\(y = 3\\).\n- \\(a_{20} = U\\): Move up to \\(y = 4\\).\n- \\(a_{21} = U\\): Move up to \\(y = 5\\).\n- \\(a_{22} = U\\): Move up to \\(y = 6\\).\n- \\(a_{23} = U\\): Move up to \\(y = 7\\).\n- \\(a_{24} = U\\): Move up to \\(y = 8\\).\n- \\(a_{25} = U\\): Move up to \\(y = 9\\).\n\nThis sequence achieves \\(y = 9\\) at turn 26 (after 12 actions) with no collisions:\n- At turns 14 and 15, the player is on freeways but no cars cover \\(x = 0\\).\n- At turns 16 and 17, the player is at \\(y = 0\\), safe from collisions.\n- For turns 18 to 25, the player is on freeways, but no cars cover \\(x = 0\\) for \\(T \\geq 18\\).\n\nNo shorter sequence is possible, as the detour to \\(y = 0\\) is necessary to avoid collisions at turns 16 and 17, and 9 up moves are required from \\(y = 0\\) to \\(y = 9\\).\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 14: \\text{ D} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 15: \\text{ D} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 16: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 17: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 18: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 19: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 20: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 21: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 22: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 23: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 24: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 25: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,1) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t_1 = 15, and I'm at y=1.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the car movements. All cars are moving right with speed 6, meaning they increase their position by 6 per turn. The car spans are given at turn 15, and I need to find where they are at future turns to avoid being on the same freeway when the car covers position 0.\n\nCollision happens at turn T only if the player is on freeway y_T and for some car on that freeway, 0 is in the car's span at turn T. Also, when I move to a new freeway, I'm not on it until the next turn, so if I move up or down, I change freeways at the end of the turn.\n\nThe player position is updated before checking collision, I think. Let me read carefully.\n\n\"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd y_T is the position after the action at turn T-1? Let's see the sequence.\n\nAt the start of turn t, player is at (0, y_t). Then I choose an action a_t, which causes y_{t+1} to be set. Then, at the end of the turn, collision is checked based on y_{t+1} and the car positions at turn t? No.\n\nThe collision rule says \"at turn T\", so I think when we say turn T, we mean after the action is taken.\n\nLet me clarify the timing.\n\nAt turn T:\n\n- Player is at position y_T (which was set at the previous turn, I think).\n\nThe game dynamics say:\n\n\"Player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\"\n\nSo at turn t, action a_t is taken, which sets y_{t+1} for the next turn.\n\nThen, for collision: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\ny_T is the position at turn T, which means that at the beginning of turn T, player is at y_T, and during turn T, we check collision based on y_T and the car spans at time T.\n\nBut the car spans are given for time T, and y_T is the position during turn T.\n\nAlso, the note says: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nSo, at turn T, you are on freeway y_T. You take action a_T, which sets y_{T+1} for the next turn. But during turn T, you are on y_T, so collision is checked for freeway y_T at time T.\n\nIf you move, you are not on y_{T+1} until turn T+1, so at turn T, you are not affected by cars on y_{T+1}.\n\nIn this case, since we start at turn t_1=15, and we are at y=1.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, I think, as there are no cars on y=0 or y=9; cars are only on y=1 to 8.\n\nThe vertical axis is y=0 to 9, and freeways with cars are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 should be safe, no cars.\n\nNow, the cars: all are moving right with speed 6.\n\nLet me list the cars for each freeway at turn 15.\n\nFreeway 1: two cars: (-6,-17, right,6) and (42,31, right,6)\n\nFor a right-moving car, span is [tail, head], so for (42,31, right,6), head is 42, tail is 31? But it says (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nLook: \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nFor right-moving: \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h]\" and it moves to [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nIn the table, for freeway 1: (-6,-17,right,6) and (42,31,right,6)\n\nFor (-6,-17,right,6): head is -6, tail is -17? But for right-moving, head should be greater than tail, I think.\n\n-6 > -17, so head -6, tail -17, so span at t=15 is [τ, h] = [-17, -6]\n\nThen at time T, span is [-17 + 6*(T-15), -6 + 6*(T-15)]\n\nSimilarly, for (42,31,right,6): head 42, tail 31, span at t=15 [31,42], at T: [31 + 6*(T-15), 42 + 6*(T-15)]\n\nBut 31 to 42, that's length 11, and speed 6, but positions are integers, I assume.\n\nSimilarly, the other car on freeway 1: (-6,-17), head -6, tail -17, so positions from -17 to -6.\n\nNow, for freeway 2, same as freeway 1: same cars, (-6,-17,right,6) and (42,31,right,6)\n\nFreeway 3 same, freeway 4 same.\n\nThen freeway 5: (-6,-17,right,6), (30,19,right,6), and (-48,-59,right,6)\n\n(-48,-59,right,6): head -48, tail -59? -48 > -59, so span [ -59, -48] at t=15.\n\nSimilarly, (30,19,right,6): head 30, tail 19, span [19,30]\n\nAnd (-6,-17,right,6): [-17,-6]\n\nSimilarly for freeway 6,7,8 same as 5.\n\nNow, I need to find when these cars cover position 0 on each freeway.\n\nCollision if at turn T, player is on freeway y, and 0 is in the span of some car on that freeway at time T.\n\nSince all cars move at speed 6, the span shifts by 6 per turn.\n\nLet me find for each freeway and each car, the times when 0 is covered.\n\nFirst, for a car with span [L, R] at time t, at time T, span is [L + 6(T-t), R + 6(T-t)] for right-moving.\n\nSet 0 in [L + 6(T-t), R + 6(T-t)]\n\nSo L + 6(T-t) <= 0 <= R + 6(T-t)\n\nSince L <= R for right-moving.\n\nSo 0 >= L + 6(T-t) and 0 <= R + 6(T-t)\n\nThus, 6(T-t) >= -L and 6(T-t) <= -R? Let's solve inequalities.\n\nFrom 0 >= L + 6(T-t) => 6(T-t) <= -L\n\nFrom 0 <= R + 6(T-t) => 6(T-t) >= -R\n\nSo -R <= 6(T-t) <= -L\n\nThen T-t >= ceil( (-R)/6 ) and T-t <= floor( (-L)/6 )? Let's think.\n\n6(T-t) >= -R and 6(T-t) <= -L\n\nSince L and R could be negative.\n\nBut -R and -L, since L and R are integers, I think positions are integers.\n\nT-t must be integer.\n\nSo for each car, the interval of T-t when 0 is covered.\n\nThen for a freeway, if any car covers 0 at time T, then the freeway is occupied at that time.\n\nI need for each freeway, the times when it is safe, i.e., no car covers 0.\n\nSince multiple cars, I need the union of the times when any car covers 0.\n\nThen safe times are when no car covers 0.\n\nFirst, let's list all cars for each freeway.\n\nFreeway 1: cars: car A: h=-6, τ=-17, so L=τ=-17, R=h=-6? No.\n\nFor right-moving, span is [τ, h] with τ < h? In this case, for (-6,-17), head h=-6, tail τ=-17, since -6 > -17, so τ=-17, h=-6, so [τ,h] = [-17,-6] at t=15.\n\nSimilarly, car B: h=42, τ=31, [31,42]\n\nAt time T, car A: [-17 +6(T-15), -6 +6(T-15)]\n\nCar B: [31 +6(T-15), 42 +6(T-15)]\n\nNow, 0 in car A span when:\n\n-17 +6(k) <= 0 <= -6 +6(k) where k=T-15\n\nSo -17 +6k <= 0 => 6k <= 17 => k <= 17/6 = 2.833, so k <= 2 since integer? k <= floor(17/6) but 17/6=2.833, so 6k <=17, k<=2 since k integer.\n\n6k <=17, k<=2.833, so k<=2 for integer k.\n\nAnd 0 <= -6 +6k => 6 <= 6k => k >=1\n\nSo for car A, k=1 and k=2.\n\nk=1: -17+6= -11, -6+6=0, so [-11,0], 0 is included.\n\nk=2: -17+12= -5, -6+12=6, [-5,6], 0 included.\n\nk=0: -17 to -6, all negative, 0 not in.\n\nk=3: -17+18=1, -6+18=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, car B: 31 +6k <= 0 <= 42 +6k\n\n31+6k <=0? 6k <= -31, impossible since k>=0.\n\n0 <=42+6k always true for k>=0.\n\nBut 31+6k <=0 implies k <= -31/6 = -5.166, so k <= -6, but k=T-15 >=0, so never true. Thus 0 never in car B span because min is 31 at k=0, which is positive.\n\nSimilarly, for other freeways with same cars, car B never covers 0.\n\nNow for car A, it covers 0 at k=1 and k=2, i.e., T=16 and T=17.\n\nT-15=k, so T=16 and 17.\n\nNow freeway 2,3,4 same as freeway 1, so for y=1,2,3,4, occupied at T=16 and T=17.\n\nNow freeway 5: cars: car C: (-6,-17,right,6) same as above, so covers 0 at T=16,17\n\ncar D: (30,19,right,6) head 30, tail 19, so [19,30] at t=15\n\nAt T, [19+6k, 30+6k]\n\n0 in? 19+6k <=0 <=30+6k\n\n19+6k <=0? 6k <= -19, impossible, k>=0.\n\nSimilarly, min 19>0, so never covers 0.\n\ncar E: (-48,-59,right,6) head -48, tail -59, so τ=-59, h=-48, [-59,-48] at t=15\n\nAt T, [-59+6k, -48+6k]\n\n0 in: -59+6k <=0 <= -48+6k\n\nFirst, 0 <= -48+6k => 6k >=48 => k>=8\n\nAnd -59+6k <=0 => 6k <=59 => k<=59/6=9.833, so k<=9\n\nSo k from 8 to 9 inclusive.\n\nk=8: -59+48= -11, -48+48=0, [-11,0], 0 included\n\nk=9: -59+54= -5, -48+54=6, [-5,6], 0 included\n\nk=10: -59+60=1, -48+60=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo car E covers 0 at k=8 and k=9, i.e., T=23 and T=24? k=T-15, so T=15+8=23, T=15+9=24.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 6,7,8 same as freeway 5.\n\nFreeway 5 has three cars: C, D, E.\n\nC: like A, covers T=16,17\n\nD: never covers 0\n\nE: covers T=23,24\n\nSo for freeway 5, occupied when C covers or E covers, so at T=16,17,23,24.\n\nSimilarly for y=6,7,8.\n\nNow freeway 1 to 4: only car A type, occupied T=16,17\n\nFreeway 5 to 8: occupied T=16,17,23,24\n\ny=1 to 4: freeways 1,2,3,4\n\ny=5 to 8: freeways 5,6,7,8\n\nNow, I start at turn t=15, position y=1.\n\nAt turn 15, I am at y=1, and I take action a_{15}, which sets y_{16}.\n\nThen at turn 16, I am at y_{16}, and collision check based on y_{16} and car positions at time 16.\n\nSimilarly for each turn.\n\nI need to reach y=9, which is safe.\n\nThe minimal number of turns H, meaning I need y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, with t_1=15.\n\nSet t_1=15.\n\nI need to find actions from a_{15} to a_{15+H-1} such that after H turns, y_{15+H} =9? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence is {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}, so for t=0, a_{t_1}, t=1, a_{t_1+1}, ..., up to t=H-1, a_{t_1+H-1}\n\nThen after these actions, y_{t_1 + H} should be 9? Let's see the position.\n\nAt turn t_1, position is (0, y_{t_1}) = (0,1)\n\nAfter action a_{t_1}, y_{t_1 +1} is set.\n\nThen after action a_{t_1 + H -1}, y_{t_1 + H} is set.\n\nAnd we want y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nIn the task: \"reach (0,9)\", and \"y_{t_1 + H -1} =9\" — let's read.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\", and \"such that y_{t_1 + H -1} =9\"\n\ny_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nNow, y_{t_1 + H -1} is the position at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nAt turn t, position is y_t.\n\nSo at turn t_1 + H -1, y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nThe actions are from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, which set y_{t_1 +1} to y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nSpecifically, a_{t_1} sets y_{t_1 +1}, a_{t_1 +1} sets y_{t_1 +2}, ..., a_{t_1 + H -1} sets y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nBut we need y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, which is the position before action a_{t_1 + H -1} is taken? Let's clarify the state.\n\nAt the start of turn t, player is at position y_t.\n\nThen, during turn t, action a_t is taken, which determines y_{t+1} for the next turn.\n\nAlso, during turn t, collision is checked based on position y_t and car positions at time t.\n\nIf no collision, we proceed.\n\nThen at the end, we want to be at position (0,9), so at some turn, y_t =9.\n\nIn this case, we need y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, meaning at turn t_1 + H -1, the player is at y=9.\n\nSince y=9 is safe, no cars, so as long as we are there, no collision.\n\nNow, we start at turn 15, y=1.\n\nWe need to choose actions to move to y=9.\n\nEach action: U, D, or S, changing y by +1, -1, or 0.\n\ny from 0 to 9, so we can't go below 0 or above 9; it says y_{t+1} in [0,9], so if at boundary, D or U might be invalid, but we can stay or move away.\n\nCurrently at y=1, we can go to y=0,1,2 with actions D, S, U.\n\nBut y=0 is safe, but we need to go to 9, so probably not useful to go down.\n\nSimilarly, y=9 safe.\n\nNow, the obstacles are on y=1 to 8 at certain times.\n\nFirst, let's list for each freeway, the times when it is occupied, i.e., when 0 is covered by some car.\n\nFor y=1: occupied at T=16 and 17 (from car A)\n\nAt other times, should be safe, but let's confirm.\n\nAt T=16, car A span: k=1, [-17+6, -6+6] = [-11,0], so 0 covered.\n\nT=17, k=2, [-17+12, -6+12] = [-5,6], 0 covered.\n\nT=18, k=3, [-17+18, -6+18] = [1,12], 0 not covered.\n\nSimilarly, car B never covers 0.\n\nSo y=1 occupied only at T=16,17.\n\nSimilarly for y=2,3,4 same.\n\nNow for y=5: cars C, D, E.\n\nCar C: same as A, covers T=16,17\n\nCar D: never\n\nCar E: covers T=23,24\n\nSo occupied at T=16,17,23,24.\n\nSimilarly for y=6,7,8.\n\nNow y=1 to 4: occupied T=16,17\n\ny=5 to 8: occupied T=16,17 and also T=23,24\n\nI need to go from y=1 at turn 15 to y=9.\n\nSince I start at turn 15, y=1.\n\nAt turn 15, I am at y=1, so I take action a_{15}, which sets y_{16}.\n\nThen at turn 16, I am at y_{16}, and collision check: if y_{16} is between 1 and 8, and occupied at T=16.\n\nSimilarly for each turn.\n\nI need to avoid being on a freeway when it is occupied.\n\nAlso, since I move one step per turn, to go from y=1 to y=9, I need at least 8 actions: 8 Up moves, but I can stay or move down, so minimal H might be 8 if I can go straight up without collision.\n\nBut let's see if possible.\n\nFirst, at turn 15, I am at y=1.\n\nI take action a_{15}, which affects y_{16}.\n\nBut collision at turn T is based on y_T and cars at T.\n\nSo for turn 15: I am at y=1, and cars at T=15: for y=1, at T=15, car A span [-17,-6], all negative, 0 not covered, so safe. Similarly, no issue at T=15.\n\nNow, I need to be careful at future turns.\n\nI want to reach y=9 quickly.\n\nIf I go up every turn, from y=1 to y=2,3,... to 9.\n\nStart turn 15, y=1.\n\nAfter a_{15}, y_{16} set.\n\nThen at turn 16, y_{16} is position, and check collision at T=16.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo suppose I do U at each turn.\n\na_{15} = U, then y_{16} = y_{15} +1 = 1+1=2\n\nThen at turn 16, I am at y=2.\n\nNow, y=2 is freeway 2, which is occupied at T=16? y=2 is freeway 2, which for y=1 to 4, occupied at T=16.\n\nAt T=16, y=2, and since occupied, collision occurs.\n\nNot good.\n\nIf I do S at turn 15, a_{15}=S, then y_{16}=1\n\nAt turn 16, y=1, which is occupied at T=16, collision.\n\nIf I do D, a_{15}=D, y_{16}=0\n\nThen at turn 16, y=0, which has no cars, so safe. But y=0, then I need to go up later.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nSince y=1 to 4 are occupied at T=16 and 17, I need to avoid being on y=1,2,3,4 at turns 16 and 17.\n\nSimilarly, for y=5 to 8, also occupied at T=16,17, so at T=16 and 17, all freeways y=1 to 8 are occupied? Is that true?\n\ny=1 to 4 occupied T=16,17\n\ny=5 to 8 occupied T=16,17,23,24\n\nSo at T=16 and 17, all y=1 to 8 are occupied, meaning if I am on any of them, collision.\n\nAt turn 15, I am at y=1, which is safe at T=15.\n\nI take action a_{15}, setting y_{16}.\n\nThen at turn 16, if y_{16} is between 1 and 8, since all occupied at T=16, collision.\n\nSo the only way to avoid collision at turn 16 is to be at y=0 or y=9 at turn 16.\n\ny=9 is far, so only y=0.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 17, same thing, all occupied.\n\nSo I must be at y=0 or y=9 at turn 16 and turn 17 to avoid collision.\n\nBut at turn 16, I am at y_{16}, which is set by a_{15}.\n\nSimilarly, y_{17} set by a_{16}, etc.\n\nNow, at turn 15, I am at y=1.\n\nIf I do D, a_{15}=D, then y_{16}=0\n\nThen at turn 16, I am at y=0, safe, no cars.\n\nNow, at turn 16, I need to take action a_{16}, setting y_{17}.\n\nAt turn 17, I need to be at y=0 or y=9 to avoid collision, but y=9 is not reachable in one step from y=0, since from y=0, I can go to y=0 (S), y=1 (U), or stay, but y=1 at turn 17 is occupied.\n\nIf I do S at turn 16, a_{16}=S, then y_{17}=0, so at turn 17, y=0, safe.\n\nThen I can stay at y=0 until it's safe to move up.\n\nBut I need to go to y=9.\n\nThe next dangerous times are T=23,24 for y=5 to 8.\n\nBut for now, at turn 17, if I am at y=0, safe.\n\nThen at turn 17, I take action, setting y_{18}.\n\nNow, after T=17, y=1 to 4 are safe, since only occupied at 16,17.\n\ny=1 to 4 occupied only at 16 and 17, so at T=18 and later, they are safe.\n\ny=5 to 8 occupied at 16,17 and also 23,24.\n\nAt T=18,19,20,21,22, y=5 to 8 are safe, except at 23,24.\n\nNow, I am at turn 17, y=0, if I stayed.\n\nBut let's list the actions.\n\nStart: turn 15, y=1\n\nTo avoid collision at T=16, I must have y_{16} =0 or 9.\n\nSince y=9 not possible, y_{16}=0.\n\nSo a_{15} must be D, so that y_{16}=0.\n\nThen at turn 16, y=0, safe.\n\nNow at turn 16, I need to set y_{17} such that at turn 17, y_{17} is safe, so y_{17} must be 0 or 9.\n\nAgain, 9 not reachable, so y_{17} must be 0.\n\nThus a_{16} must be S or D? y_{17} = y_{16} + Δy = 0 + Δy\n\nIf a_{16}=S, Δy=0, y_{17}=0\n\nIf a_{16}=D, Δy=-1, but y=0, y_{17} would be -1, but y must be in [0,9], so probably not allowed, or clamped? The rule says y_{t+1} in [0,9], so if I try to go down from 0, I might stay at 0 or something. But it doesn't specify, but to be safe, assume that if action would take out of bounds, it stays or something. But let's see.\n\n\"y_{t+1} \\in [0,9]\", and \"Δy_t = +1 if U, -1 if D, 0 if S\", so if y_t=0 and D, y_{t+1} = -1, which is not in [0,9], so probably invalid, or we assume it stays at 0? The problem doesn't specify, but to avoid issue, perhaps we should not choose D at y=0.\n\nSimilarly for U at y=9.\n\nSo I think actions that would take out of bounds are not allowed, or we can assume y_{t+1} is clamped to [0,9].\n\nBut to be precise, let's assume that the action is only taken if possible, otherwise invalid.\n\nBut for safety, from y=0, only S or U possible; D is invalid or does nothing.\n\nSimilarly for y=9.\n\nIn this case, at y=0, I can do U to y=1, or S to stay y=0.\n\nNot D.\n\nSimilarly, at y=9, D to y=8 or S to stay, not U.\n\nNow back to turn 16: y=0.\n\nI need y_{17}=0 or 9 for safety at turn 17.\n\nBut y_{17}=9 impossible from here, so must have y_{17}=0.\n\nThus a_{16} must be S, so y_{17}=0.\n\nThen at turn 17, y=0, safe.\n\nNow at turn 17, I take action a_{17}, setting y_{18}.\n\nAt turn 18, since T=18>17, y=1 to 4 are safe, y=5 to 8 are safe except at 23,24.\n\nI can start moving up.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nFrom y=0, I can go up.\n\nBut y=5 to 8 have danger at T=23,24.\n\nNow, turn 17: y=0\n\na_{17} = ? I can do U to go to y=1.\n\ny_{18} =1\n\nThen at turn 18, y=1, which is safe since T=18 not occupied.\n\nSimilarly, I can keep going up.\n\nBut I need to avoid y=5 to 8 at T=23 and 24.\n\nNow, let's list the turns.\n\nSet k = T - 15, so turn T corresponds to k.\n\nTurn 15: k=0, y=1\n\nAfter a_{15}, y_{16} set.\n\nWe did a_{15}=D, so y_{16}=0\n\nTurn 16: k=1, y=0\n\na_{16}=S, y_{17}=0\n\nTurn 17: k=2, y=0\n\nNow a_{17}, I can do U, so y_{18} = y_{17} +1 = 0+1=1\n\nThen turn 18: k=3, y=1\n\nNow y=1 is safe at k=3.\n\nI can do U again, a_{18}=U, y_{19}=2\n\nTurn 19: k=4, y=2, safe\n\na_{19}=U, y_{20}=3\n\nTurn 20: k=5, y=3, safe\n\na_{20}=U, y_{21}=4\n\nTurn 21: k=6, y=4, safe\n\nNow from y=4, I can go to y=5.\n\nBut y=5 is freeway 5, which has danger at T=23,24, i.e., k=8,9.\n\nk = T-15, T=23 is k=8, T=24 is k=9.\n\nNow at turn 21: k=6, y=4\n\na_{21} = U, then y_{22}=5\n\nThen turn 22: k=7, y=5\n\nAt k=7, T=15+7=22, is y=5 occupied? y=5 to 8 occupied at T=23,24, not at 22.\n\nT=22, k=7.\n\nFor y=5, occupied at T=23,24, so at T=22, safe.\n\nSimilarly, I can be on y=5 at turn 22.\n\nThen a_{22}, I can go to y=6.\n\nBut I need to not be on y=5 to 8 at T=23 and 24.\n\nNow, at turn 22: y=5 (after a_{21}=U)\n\nTurn 22: k=7, y=5, safe\n\na_{22} = U, then y_{23} =6\n\nThen at turn 23: k=8, y=6\n\nNow T=23, y=6 is freeway 6, which is occupied at T=23, since y=5-8 occupied at 23,24.\n\nSo collision at turn 23.\n\nNot good.\n\nIf at turn 22, I do S, stay at y=5.\n\nThen y_{23}=5\n\nAt turn 23, y=5, T=23, occupied, collision.\n\nIf I do D, to y=4, but y=4 is safe at T=23.\n\nBut then I go down, not helpful.\n\nI need to be above y=8 or below, but y=9 is safe.\n\nSince at T=23 and 24, only y=5-8 occupied, y=1-4 and y=9 are safe.\n\ny=0 and y=9 safe.\n\nSo at turn 23 and 24, I need to be not on y=5,6,7,8.\n\nIn the sequence above, at turn 22, I am at y=5.\n\nIf I go up to y=6 at turn 23, collision.\n\nI could stay at lower levels until after T=24.\n\nBut that might take more turns.\n\nSince I need to reach y=9, and I can move to y=9 before T=23.\n\nLet's see the current position and time.\n\nAfter turn 17, I am at y=0 at turn 17 (k=2)\n\nThen I started moving up.\n\nTurn 17: y=0, a_{17}=U, y_{18}=1\n\nTurn 18: y=1, a_{18}=U, y_{19}=2\n\nTurn 19: y=2, a_{19}=U, y_{20}=3\n\nTurn 20: y=3, a_{20}=U, y_{21}=4\n\nTurn 21: y=4, a_{21}=U, y_{22}=5\n\nTurn 22: y=5\n\nNow from here, if I go up, to y=6 at turn 23, collision.\n\nIf I stay, y=5 at turn 23, collision.\n\nIf I go down to y=4, a_{22}=D, then y_{23}=4\n\nAt turn 23, y=4, which is safe, since y=1-4 not occupied at T=23.\n\nThen at turn 23, I can stay or move.\n\nBut y=4, I need to go to y=9, still 5 steps away.\n\nAfter T=24, I can move up.\n\nAt turn 23, y=4, safe.\n\na_{23} = ? I can do S or U or D.\n\nIf U, to y=5.\n\nBut at turn 24, T=24, y=5 if I go there, occupied.\n\nProblem.\n\nAt turn 23, y=4\n\nIf I do U, a_{23}=U, y_{24}=5\n\nThen at turn 24, y=5, T=24, occupied, collision.\n\nIf I do S, a_{23}=S, y_{24}=4, safe at turn 24.\n\nThen after, I can move up.\n\nBut at turn 24, y=4, safe.\n\nThen a_{24} = U, y_{25}=5\n\nNow turn 25: k=10, T=25, y=5\n\nAt T=25, for y=5, occupied? Only at 23,24, so at 25 safe.\n\nSimilarly, I can go up to y=9.\n\nBut let's see how many turns.\n\nI need to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nCurrently, from turn 22: y=5\n\nTo avoid collision at T=23 and 24, I need to not be on y=5-8 at those turns.\n\nAt turn 22, y=5, I can go down to y=4.\n\na_{22}=D, then y_{23}=4\n\nTurn 23: y=4, safe (T=23, y=4 not occupied)\n\nThen a_{23}, I can do S to stay at y=4, or U to y=5, but if U, y_{24}=5, then turn 24 y=5 occupied.\n\nSo better to stay: a_{23}=S, y_{24}=4\n\nTurn 24: y=4, safe (T=24, y=4 not occupied)\n\nThen a_{24}=U, y_{25}=5\n\nTurn 25: y=5, safe (T=25, not 23 or 24)\n\nThen I can go up: a_{25}=U, y_{26}=6\n\nTurn 26: y=6, safe\n\na_{26}=U, y_{27}=7\n\nTurn 27: y=7, safe\n\na_{27}=U, y_{28}=8\n\nTurn 28: y=8, safe? T=28, k=13, not 23 or 24, so safe.\n\na_{28}=U, y_{29}=9\n\nThen at turn 29, y=9, which is safe.\n\nNow, y_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{15 + H -1} =9\n\nt_1=15, so at turn 15+H-1, y=9.\n\nIn this case, at turn 29, y=9.\n\n15 + H -1 =29, so H-1=14, H=15.\n\nBut let's list the actions from turn 15.\n\nTurn 15: a_{15} = D, to go to y=0\n\nTurn 16: a_{16} = S, stay y=0\n\nTurn 17: a_{17} = U, to y=1\n\nTurn 18: a_{18} = U, to y=2\n\nTurn 19: a_{19} = U, to y=3\n\nTurn 20: a_{20} = U, to y=4\n\nTurn 21: a_{21} = U, to y=5\n\nTurn 22: a_{22} = D, to y=4? y_{23}=4\n\nAt turn 21: y=4, a_{21}=U, y_{22}=5\n\nTurn 22: y=5, a_{22}=D, then y_{23}=4\n\nTurn 23: y=4, a_{23}=S, y_{24}=4\n\nTurn 24: y=4, a_{24}=U, y_{25}=5\n\nTurn 25: y=5, a_{25}=U, y_{26}=6\n\nTurn 26: y=6, a_{26}=U, y_{27}=7\n\nTurn 27: y=7, a_{27}=U, y_{28}=8\n\nTurn 28: y=8, a_{28}=U, y_{29}=9\n\nThen at turn 29, y=9.\n\nH is the number of turns, from t=0 to H-1 for actions, with t_1 + t.\n\nActions from a_{15} to a_{28}, that's 14 actions? t from 0 to 13? Let's index.\n\nt_1=15, actions a_{15 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nAfter H actions, y_{15 + H} is set, but we need y_{15 + H -1} =9.\n\nIn the sequence, after a_{15 + H -1}, y_{15 + H} is set, but y_{15 + H -1} is the position at turn 15 + H -1.\n\nIn this case, at turn 29, y=9, so 15 + H -1 =29, so 14 + H =29? 15 + H -1 =29, so H-1=14, H=15.\n\nActions from a_{15} to a_{15+14} = a_{29}? No.\n\nActions: {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1}\n\nSo for t=0, a_{t_1} = a_{15}\n\nt=1, a_{16}\n\n...\n\nt=H-1, a_{t_1 + H -1}\n\nThen after these actions, at turn t_1 + H, position is set, but we need position at turn t_1 + H -1 to be 9.\n\nThat is, before the last action or something.\n\nAt turn t_1 + H -1, after action a_{t_1 + H -1} is taken, y_{t_1 + H} is set, but the position at turn t_1 + H -1 is y_{t_1 + H -1}, which is the state before action a_{t_1 + H -1} or after?\n\nI think I have confusion.\n\nDefine:\n\nAt the start of turn T, player is at position y_T.\n\nDuring turn T, action a_T is taken, which sets y_{T+1} for the next turn.\n\nAlso, during turn T, collision is checked based on y_T and car positions at time T.\n\nIf no collision, we proceed.\n\nThe position at turn T is y_T.\n\nWe need y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, meaning at turn t_1 + H -1, player is at position 9.\n\nIn the action sequence, we take actions from a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1}, which affect y_{t_1 +1} to y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- a_{t_1} sets y_{t_1 +1}\n\n- a_{t_1 +1} sets y_{t_1 +2}\n\n- ...\n\n- a_{t_1 + H -1} sets y_{t_1 + H}\n\nBut y_{t_1 + H -1} is the position at turn t_1 + H -1, which is set by a_{t_1 + H -2}? Let's see.\n\nAt turn t_1, position y_{t_1}\n\nAfter a_{t_1}, y_{t_1 +1} set\n\nAt turn t_1 +1, position y_{t_1 +1}\n\nAfter a_{t_1 +1}, y_{t_1 +2} set\n\n...\n\nAt turn t_1 + H -1, position y_{t_1 + H -1}\n\nAfter a_{t_1 + H -1}, y_{t_1 + H} set\n\nWe need y_{t_1 + H -1} =9\n\nThe actions are from a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1}, which are taken during turns t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nIn my earlier sequence, I have y=9 at turn 29.\n\nt_1=15, so 15 + H -1 =29, so H-1=14, H=15.\n\nActions from a_{15} to a_{29}? t from 0 to H-1=14, so a_{15} to a_{15+14} = a_{29}, but a_{29} sets y_{30}, but we need y_{29}=9.\n\nAt turn 29, y_{29} is the position before action a_{29}, so to have y_{29}=9, it must be set by previous actions.\n\nIn the sequence, when we take a_{t_1 + H -1} at turn t_1 + H -1, y_{t_1 + H} is set, but y_{t_1 + H -1} is already the position at that turn.\n\nFor example, in my sequence, at turn 28, y=8 (from previous), then a_{28}=U, sets y_{29}=9.\n\nThen at turn 29, position y_{29}=9, which is what we want.\n\nAnd action a_{28} is the last action in the sequence for H=15.\n\nActions: t from 0 to 14, a_{15} to a_{29}, but a_{29} is taken at turn 29, which sets y_{30}, but we don't care about that.\n\nBut at turn 29, after a_{28}, y_{29} is set to 9, so at turn 29, position is 9.\n\nAnd we don't take action at turn 29 in the sequence, since actions up to a_{t_1 + H -1} = a_{29} for H=15? t_1 + H -1 =15 +15 -1=29, so a_{29} is included.\n\nBut a_{29} is taken at turn 29, which might set y_{30}, but for collision at turn 29, we are at y_{29}, and if y_{29}=9, safe, no issue.\n\nThen after that, we stop.\n\nIn the sequence, we include a_{t_1 + H -1} = a_{29}, which we can set to S or something, but since we are at y=9, we can do S to stay.\n\nBut in this case, for reaching, we just need to be at y=9 at some turn, so a_{29} can be S.\n\nBut in my sequence, I have a_{28}=U to set y_{29}=9.\n\nThen at turn 29, y=9, so I can have a_{29}=S, but it's not necessary for reaching, but since the sequence must be given, I need to include it or not?\n\nThe action sequence is for t=0 to H-1, and at turn t_1 + H -1, we are at position 9.\n\nAfter action a_{t_1 + H -1}, y_{t_1 + H} is set, but we don't care as long as at turn t_1 + H -1, y=9.\n\nSo at that turn, we can be at y=9 from previous, and action a_{t_1 + H -1} can be S or whatever, but since y=9, U might be invalid, so probably S.\n\nIn my sequence, I reached y=9 at turn 29 with a_{28}=U.\n\nThen at turn 29, y=9, so for a_{29}, I can do S.\n\nBut in the sequence for H=15, actions from a_{15} to a_{29}, with a_{29} being at turn 29.\n\nBut let's list the turns.\n\nI think I can do better to reduce H.\n\nCurrently H=15, but I wasted time at y=0 and going down.\n\nSince the danger at T=16,17 is only two turns, I can stay at y=0 for those turns, then go up quickly.\n\nBut from y=0 to y=9, minimum 9 moves, but with the danger at T=23,24 for y=5-8, I need to be past y=8 or below before T=23.\n\nLet's find a faster way.\n\nStart turn 15, y=1\n\na_{15} = D, y_{16}=0\n\nturn 16, y=0\n\na_{16} = S, y_{17}=0\n\nturn 17, y=0\n\nNow, from here, instead of going up step by step, I can go up faster, but I can only move one per turn.\n\nAt turn 17, y=0\n\na_{17} = U, y_{18}=1\n\nturn 18, y=1, safe\n\na_{18} = U, y_{19}=2\n\nturn 19, y=2, safe\n\na_{19} = U, y_{20}=3\n\nturn 20, y=3, safe\n\na_{20} = U, y_{21}=4\n\nturn 21, y=4, safe\n\nNow at turn 21, y=4\n\nI need to go to y=5, but at T=23,24, y=5-8 occupied.\n\nT=23 is turn 23, k=8.\n\nCurrent turn 21, k=6, T=21.\n\nIf I go to y=5 at turn 22, as before.\n\nBut at turn 22, y=5, I can go directly to y=6,7,8 or 9, but I can only move one step.\n\na_{21} = U, y_{22}=5\n\nturn 22, y=5, safe (T=22)\n\nNow, if I do U again, a_{22}=U, y_{23}=6\n\nturn 23, y=6, T=23, occupied, collision.\n\nIf I do nothing, S, y_{23}=5, collision.\n\nIf I do D, y_{23}=4, safe.\n\nBut then I am at y=4 at turn 23.\n\nThen I have to wait until after T=24.\n\nBut at turn 23, y=4, I can stay, a_{23}=S, y_{24}=4\n\nturn 24, y=4, safe\n\nThen a_{24}=U, y_{25}=5, and so on to y=9 at turn 29 as before.\n\nTo save time, from y=4 at turn 21, I could stay or something.\n\nAnother idea: go to y=9 before T=23.\n\nT=23 is turn 23.\n\nCurrent turn 21, y=4.\n\nI need to reach y=9 by turn 22 or something.\n\nFrom y=4 to y=9, minimum 5 steps: turns 21 to 25.\n\nAt turn 21, y=4\n\na_{21}=U, y_{22}=5\n\nturn 22, y=5\n\na_{22}=U, y_{23}=6\n\nBut at turn 23, y=6, collision.\n\nIf I could jump, but no.\n\nSo impossible to be at y=9 before turn 23 from here.\n\nTurn 22: y=5, if I do U, y_{23}=6, collision.\n\nSo I must avoid being on y=5-8 at turn 23 and 24.\n\nAt turn 22, y=5, I can only go to y=4,5,6.\n\ny=6 at turn 23 is bad, y=5 bad, so only to y=4.\n\nThen proceed as before.\n\nPerhaps I can go to a higher y earlier.\n\nBut at the beginning, I had to go to y=0 to avoid turn 16 and 17.\n\nIs there another way?\n\nFor example, at turn 15, instead of going down, can I go up? But to where? y=2 at turn 16 is occupied, y=1 occupied, only y=0 or 9 safe.\n\nBut y=9 not reachable, so must go to y=0.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 16, must stay at y=0 or go to y=9, impossible.\n\nSo no choice but to be at y=0 for turns 16 and 17.\n\nThen from turn 18, I can start moving up.\n\nTurn 18: y=1\n\nTurn 19: y=2\n\nTurn 20: y=3\n\nTurn 21: y=4\n\nTurn 22: y=5\n\nThen at turn 22, I must go down to avoid turn 23 on y=5-8.\n\nTo save one turn, at turn 22, instead of going to y=5, I could stay at y=4 longer or something.\n\nAt turn 21, y=4, I could do S, a_{21}=S, y_{22}=4\n\nThen turn 22: y=4, safe\n\na_{22}=U, y_{23}=5\n\nBut at turn 23, y=5, T=23, occupied, collision.\n\nNot good.\n\nIf I do a_{21}=U, y_{22}=5, then a_{22}=D, y_{23}=4, same as before.\n\nSo I have to be at y=4 or below at turn 23 and 24.\n\nThen after turn 24, go up.\n\nFrom turn 24, y=4, a_{24}=U, y_{25}=5\n\nThen to y=9 at turn 29.\n\nBut turn 24 to 29 is 6 turns to go from 4 to 9? y=4 to y=9, 5 steps: y=5,6,7,8,9 at turns 25,26,27,28,29.\n\ny_{25}=5, y_{26}=6, ..., y_{29}=9.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, from start:\n\nTurn 15: y=1, a_{15}=D, y_{16}=0\n\nTurn 16: y=0, a_{16}=S, y_{17}=0\n\nTurn 17: y=0, a_{17}=U, y_{18}=1\n\nTurn 18: y=1, a_{18}=U, y_{19}=2\n\nTurn 19: y=2, a_{19}=U, y_{20}=3\n\nTurn 20: y=3, a_{20}=U, y_{21}=4\n\nTurn 21: y=4, a_{21}=U, y_{22}=5  // but at turn 22, y=5\n\nNow, to avoid, a_{22}=D, y_{23}=4\n\nTurn 23: y=4, a_{23}=S, y_{24}=4  // stay to avoid turn 24\n\nTurn 24: y=4, a_{24}=U, y_{25}=5\n\nTurn 25: y=5, a_{25}=U, y_{26}=6\n\nTurn 26: y=6, a_{26}=U, y_{27}=7\n\nTurn 27: y=7, a_{27}=U, y_{28}=8\n\nTurn 28: y=8, a_{28}=U, y_{29}=9\n\nThen turn 29: y=9\n\nNow, to have y_{29}=9, we need action at turn 28: U.\n\nThen at turn 29, we are at y=9.\n\nFor the action sequence, we need up to a_{t_1 + H -1} with y_{t_1 + H -1}=9.\n\nHere y_{29}=9, t_1=15, so 15 + H -1 =29, H-1=14, H=15.\n\nActions from a_{15} to a_{29}, but a_{29} is at turn 29, which sets y_{30}, but since we are at y=9, we can set a_{29}=S.\n\nIn the sequence, we include a_{15} to a_{29} for H=15.\n\nBut a_{29} is not necessary for reaching, but to have the position at turn 29, we need actions up to a_{28}.\n\nThe position y_t at turn t is determined by actions up to a_{t-1}.\n\ny_t is set by a_{t-1}.\n\nFor y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, it is set by a_{t_1 + H -2}.\n\nThen at turn t_1 + H -1, we take action a_{t_1 + H -1}, but it doesn't affect y_{t_1 + H -1}, only future.\n\nIn the sequence, we include actions from a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1}, meaning we take actions during turns t_1 to t_1 + H -1, and at the start of turn t_1 + H -1, we are at y=9.\n\nIn this case, for turn 29, y=9, so we start turn 29 at y=9, then we take action a_{29}, which could be S.\n\nBut to minimize H, perhaps we can reach earlier.\n\nFor example, if I can be at y=9 at turn 28.\n\nIs it possible?\n\nStart turn 15 y=1\n\nAfter a_{15}=D, y_{16}=0\n\na_{16}=S, y_{17}=0\n\na_{17}=U, y_{18}=1\n\na_{18}=U, y_{19}=2\n\na_{19}=U, y_{20}=3\n\na_{20}=U, y_{21}=4\n\nNow from y=4 at turn 21, instead of going to y=5, I go directly to y=9? No, only one step.\n\na_{21}=U, y_{22}=5\n\nThen at turn 22, y=5, I must go down or something to avoid next turns.\n\nBut to be at y=9 at turn 28, I need to move up faster, but I can't.\n\nFor example, at turn 21 y=4, a_{21}=U, y_{22}=5\n\nturn 22 y=5, if I do U, y_{23}=6, but collision at turn 23.\n\nNot possible.\n\nIf I stay at y=4 longer.\n\na_{21}=S, y_{22}=4\n\nturn 22 y=4\n\na_{22}=U, y_{23}=5, but turn 23 y=5, collision.\n\na_{22}=U, y_{23}=5, collision.\n\nNo, so I have to be at y=4 or below at turn 23 and 24.\n\nThen the earliest to start going up is turn 24 from y=4.\n\nThen y_{25}=5, y_{26}=6, y_{27}=7, y_{28}=8, y_{29}=9.\n\nSo y=9 at turn 29.\n\nIf I can be at a higher y before, but I can't because of the initial danger.\n\nFor example, from turn 18 y=1, I can only reach y=5 at turn 22, which is too early for the second danger.\n\nTurn 18: y=1, a_{18}=U, y_{19}=2\n\n... up to a_{21}=U, y_{22}=5, same as before.\n\nNo faster.\n\nSo H=15 seems necessary.\n\nBut let's confirm if I can reach y=9 earlier by not going down initially, but I have to for the first danger.\n\nAnother idea: since y=9 is safe, if I can go directly to y=9, but from y=1, it takes 8 turns, but during that, I have to pass through occupied areas.\n\nFor example, at turn 15, a_{15}=U, y_{16}=2, but at turn 16, y=2 occupied, collision.\n\nSimilarly, any action to y=1 or 2 at turn 16 will be occupied.\n\nSo impossible to be on y=1-8 at turn 16 or 17.\n\nMust be at y=0.\n\nSo I think H=15 is the minimal.\n\nBut in the sequence, I have a_{22}=D to go down, but I could avoid going to y=5 at all before the danger.\n\nFor example, at turn 21, y=4, instead of going to y=5, I stay at y=4.\n\na_{21}=S, y_{22}=4\n\nThen turn 22: y=4\n\na_{22}=S, y_{23}=4\n\nturn 23: y=4, safe\n\na_{23}=S, y_{24}=4\n\nturn 24: y=4, safe\n\nThen a_{24}=U, y_{25}=5\n\netc.\n\nBut this takes more turns; I reach y=9 later.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo the sequence I have is better.\n\nNow, in the sequence, at turn 22, I go down to y=4, but I was at y=5, which is fine at turn 22.\n\nThen go down to avoid.\n\nBut in terms of number of actions, it's the same.\n\nNow for the answer, I need to list the actions.\n\nt_1=15.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 15: D\n\nTurn 16: S\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nTurn 20: U\n\nTurn 21: U\n\nTurn 22: D  // to go to y=4 for turn 23\n\nAt turn 21, y=4, a_{21}=U, so y_{22}=5\n\nThen turn 22, y=5, a_{22}=D, so y_{23}=4\n\nThen turn 23, y=4, a_{23}=S, y_{24}=4\n\nThen turn 24, y=4, a_{24}=U, y_{25}=5\n\n...\n\nUp to turn 28: U to y=9 at turn 29.\n\nThen at turn 29, y=9, so for the sequence, actions from turn 15 to turn 28 to set y_{29}=9, but we need to include up to a_{29} for H=15? Let's set H.\n\ny_{15 + H -1} =9\n\nSet to turn 29, so 15 + H -1 =29, H-1=14, H=15.\n\nActions for t=0 to 14: a_{15} to a_{29}\n\nNow, a_{15} to a_{28} are as above, and a_{29} at turn 29, since y=9, we can set to S.\n\nNow, write the sequence.\n\nFirst, from above:\n\na_{15}: D\n\na_{16}: S\n\na_{17}: U\n\na_{18}: U\n\na_{19}: U\n\na_{20}: U\n\na_{21}: U  // to y=5 at turn 22? y_{22} set to 5 by a_{21}\n\nPosition at turn 22: y=5\n\na_{22}: D  // to set y_{23}=4\n\nPosition turn 23: y=4\n\na_{23}: S  // set y_{24}=4\n\nPosition turn 24: y=4\n\na_{24}: U  // set y_{25}=5\n\nPosition turn 25: y=5\n\na_{25}: U  // set y_{26}=6\n\nTurn 26: y=6\n\na_{26}: U  // y_{27}=7\n\nTurn 27: y=7\n\na_{27}: U  // y_{28}=8\n\nTurn 28: y=8\n\na_{28}: U  // y_{29}=9\n\nNow turn 29: y=9\n\nWe need to include a_{29}. Since at turn 29, y=9, we can do a_{29}=S.\n\nBut for the sequence, it's fine.\n\nIn the action list, for turn t_1 + H -1 = turn 29, we have a_{29}.\n\nNow, to write the answer.\n\nBut let's confirm if at any point collision.\n\nTurn 15: position y=1, T=15, y=1: car A span [-17,-6], 0 not in, safe.\n\nAction D, y_{16}=0\n\nTurn 16: position y=0, no cars, safe. Action S, y_{17}=0\n\nTurn 17: position y=0, safe. Action U, y_{18}=1\n\nTurn 18: position y=1, T=18, y=1 not occupied (only 16,17), safe. Action U, y_{19}=2\n\nTurn 19: y=2, T=19, safe. Action U, y_{20}=3\n\nTurn 20: y=3, T=20, safe. Action U, y_{21}=4\n\nTurn 21: y=4, T=21, safe. Action U, y_{22}=5\n\nTurn 22: y=5, T=22, for y=5, occupied at 23,24, not 22, so safe. Action D, y_{23}=4\n\nTurn 23: y=4, T=23, y=4 not occupied (only y=1-4 at 16,17, not 23), safe. Action S, y_{24}=4\n\nTurn 24: y=4, T=24, safe similarly. Action U, y_{25}=5\n\nTurn 25: y=5, T=25, not 23 or 24, safe. Action U, y_{26}=6\n\nTurn 26: y=6, T=26, safe. Action U, y_{27}=7\n\nTurn 27: y=7, T=27, safe. Action U, y_{28}=8\n\nTurn 28: y=8, T=28, safe. Action U, y_{29}=9\n\nTurn 29: y=9, safe. Then action a_{29}=S, but not needed.\n\nIn the sequence, we have 15 actions.\n\nBut to save one action, since at turn 22, instead of going to y=5 and down, I could go directly to a safe zone, but no.\n\nAnother idea: go to y=9 before the second danger, but not possible.\n\nSo I think H=15 is minimal.\n\nBut let's count the number of moves.\n\nFrom turn 15 to 29, that's 15 turns, but actions from 15 to 29, 15 actions.\n\nt from 0 to 14, 15 actions.\n\nPosition at turn 29 is y=9.\n\nWe can reach at turn 28?\n\nSuppose at turn 28, y=9.\n\nThen y_{28}=9.\n\nSet by a_{27}.\n\nFrom where? y_{27} must be 8 or 9.\n\nIf y_{27}=8, a_{27}=U to y_{28}=9.\n\nBut at turn 27, position y=8, T=27, is it safe? y=8, freeway 8, which is occupied only at T=23,24, not 27, so safe.\n\nBut how to be at y=8 at turn 27.\n\nFrom start, need to go from y=1 to y=8 in 12 turns? From turn 15 to turn 27.\n\nBut with the delays.\n\nStart turn 15 y=1, must go to y=0 for turn 16 and 17.\n\nSo y=0 at turn 16 and 17.\n\nThen from turn 18 y=1 to turn 27 y=8, that's 10 turns to go from y=1 to y=8, which needs 7 up moves, possible with 3 stays or something.\n\nBut I need to avoid the danger at turn 23.\n\nFor example:\n\nTurn 18: y=1\n\nTurn 19: y=2\n\nTurn 20: y=3\n\nTurn 21: y=4\n\nNow at turn 21, y=4\n\nI need to be not on y=5-8 at turn 23 and 24.\n\nTurn 23 is in 2 turns.\n\nIf at turn 21, I do U to y=5 at turn 22.\n\nThen at turn 22, y=5, I can do U to y=6 at turn 23, but collision.\n\nOr stay, collision.\n\nOr down to y=4 at turn 23.\n\nThen at turn 23, y=4, safe.\n\nBut y=4 at turn 23, then to y=8 at turn 27, I need to go to y=5,6,7,8.\n\nTurn 24: from y=4, a_{23}=U, y_{24}=5, but at turn 24, y=5, T=24 occupied, collision.\n\nIf a_{23}=S, y_{24}=4, then a_{24}=U, y_{25}=5, etc., as before, reaching y=8 at turn 28 or later.\n\nNot at turn 27.\n\nIf at turn 21, I stay at y=4: a_{21}=S, y_{22}=4\n\nThen a_{22}=U, y_{23}=5, but turn 23 y=5 collision.\n\nNot possible.\n\nSo cannot reach y=8 by turn 27; must be at y=4 or below at turn 23 and 24, then go up.\n\nThus y=9 at turn 29 is earliest.\n\nSo minimal H=15.\n\nNow for the answer.\n\nSequence of actions:\n\nTurn 15: D\n\nTurn 16: S\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nTurn 20: U\n\nTurn 21: U\n\nTurn 22: D\n\nTurn 23: S\n\nTurn 24: U\n\nTurn 25: U\n\nTurn 26: U\n\nTurn 27: U\n\nTurn 28: U\n\nTurn 29: S  // since at y=9, we can stay\n\nIn the sequence, a_{29} is included.\n\nTo write in the box.\n\nBut in the format, it should be for turns starting from t_1.\n\nAlso, in the car state, for freeway 5-8, there is car D: (30,19,right,6), but I thought it never covers 0, which is correct.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nI think no issue.\n\nSo the minimal H is 15.\n</think>\nTo reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 1)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 15\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 15. The sequence of actions ensures that the player avoids all occupied freeways at critical times:\n\n- Freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 4\\) are occupied at turns 16 and 17.\n- Freeways \\(y = 5\\) to \\(y = 8\\) are occupied at turns 16, 17, 23, and 24.\n\nThe strategy involves:\n1. Moving down to \\(y = 0\\) at turn 16 to avoid collision during turns 16 and 17, as \\(y = 0\\) has no cars.\n2. Staying at \\(y = 0\\) for turn 17 to remain safe.\n3. Moving up from \\(y = 0\\) starting at turn 18, reaching \\(y = 5\\) by turn 22.\n4. Moving down to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 23 to avoid being on \\(y = 5\\) to \\(y = 8\\) during turns 23 and 24.\n5. Staying at \\(y = 4\\) for turn 24 to remain safe.\n6. Moving up from \\(y = 4\\) starting at turn 25, reaching \\(y = 9\\) by turn 29.\n\nThe action sequence for turns \\(t_1 + t\\) from \\(t = 0\\) to \\(t = H-1 = 14\\) (i.e., turns 15 to 29) is as follows:\n\n- At turn 15, action \\(D\\) moves down to \\(y = 0\\) for turn 16.\n- At turn 16, action \\(S\\) stays at \\(y = 0\\) for turn 17.\n- At turn 17, action \\(U\\) moves up to \\(y = 1\\) for turn 18.\n- At turns 18 to 21, actions \\(U\\) move up one level per turn to reach \\(y = 5\\) by turn 22.\n- At turn 22, action \\(D\\) moves down to \\(y = 4\\) for turn 23 to avoid the occupation at turn 23.\n- At turn 23, action \\(S\\) stays at \\(y = 4\\) for turn 24 to avoid the occupation at turn 24.\n- At turn 24, action \\(U\\) moves up to \\(y = 5\\) for turn 25.\n- At turns 25 to 28, actions \\(U\\) move up one level per turn to reach \\(y = 9\\) by turn 29.\n- At turn 29, action \\(S\\) stays at \\(y = 9\\), as the position is reached.\n\nThis sequence ensures \\(y_{29} = 9\\) at turn 29 (since \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 15 + 15 - 1 = 29\\)) with no collisions, as verified against the car positions and occupation times.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 15: \\, D \\\\ \\text{Turn } 16: \\, S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 17: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 18: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 19: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 20: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 21: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 22: \\, D \\\\ \\text{Turn } 23: \\, S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 24: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 25: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 26: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 27: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 28: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 29: \\, S \\\\ \\end{array} }",

We need to get to (0,9) in minimal turns H, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to 8.\n\nThe player can move up (U: y+1), down (D: y-1), or stay (S: y same). Note that the grid has y from 0 to 9, and we start at y=0 and want to get to y=9.\n\nThe car update: each car is defined by (head, tail, direction, speed). The update for a car at turn T (from the current turn t1) is:\n  For a left-moving car: Span(T) = [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]   [Note: the example shows left-moving? But the table says \"right\" for all. Let me check the update rule.]\n\nActually, the update rule in the problem:\n  Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, tau] -> Span(T) = [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\n  Right-moving: Span(t1) = [tau, h] -> Span(T) = [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut note the representation in the table: \n  For example, freeway 1: (0, -11, right, 6) and (48,37,right,6)\n\nFor a right-moving car, the initial span at t1 is [tau, h]? But in the table it's given as (head, tail). Let me interpret:\n\nIn the problem, for a right-moving car, the initial span is given as (head, tail) and then the update is: [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n\nBut note: the problem says for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [tau, h]\" meaning that the car's head is at h and tail at tau? But then the update moves the entire car to the right.\n\nHowever, in the table, the first car on freeway1 is (0, -11, right, 6). \n  So, at t1 (turn 16), the span for this car (right-moving) is [tau, h] = [-11, 0]? But the problem says the representation in the table is (head, tail). \n\nWait, the problem states: \"Cars (head h, tail tau, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nSo for a right-moving car, the head is the front (rightmost) and tail is the leftmost? Then the span at t1 is [tail, head] = [-11, 0]. Then at time T, the span becomes [tail + s*(T-t1), head + s*(T-t1)].\n\nSimilarly, for a left-moving car, the head would be the front (leftmost) and tail the rightmost? But in the table all are right-moving.\n\nSo for every car in this state, they are right-moving. Therefore, for a car (h, tau, right, s) at t1, the span at time T (>=t1) is:\n  [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nCollision condition: at turn T, if the player is at freeway k (so y_T = k) and at that same turn, there is a car on freeway k such that 0 (the x-coordinate of the player) is in the span of that car at turn T.\n\nImportant: the player is at (0, y_t) at turn t. And at turn T, if the player is on freeway k (so y_T = k) and at that turn, 0 is in the span of any car on freeway k, then collision.\n\nAlso note: if at turn T the player moves to a new freeway (so y_{T+1} != y_T), then at turn T the player is still on freeway y_T. And at turn T, the player is not yet on freeway y_{T+1}. So when moving, the player is on the starting freeway during the entire turn.\n\nOur goal: start at turn 16 at (0,0) and we want to get to (0,9). We can only change y by -1,0,1 per turn. We have to avoid being at a freeway k (from 1 to 8) at a turn T when there is a car on that freeway k at turn T that has 0 in its span.\n\nWe note:\n- The player starts at y=0 (which is not a freeway with cars, so safe) and ends at y=9 (also not a freeway, so safe). The freeways with cars are y=1 to 8.\n\nWe must traverse through freeways 1 to 8 without being there when a car covers x=0.\n\nPlan: we need to simulate the movement of the cars over time and find a sequence of actions (U, D, S) that gets us from y=0 to y=9 in minimal H, avoiding collisions.\n\nSince the cars are moving at speed 6 (all have s=6), and they are right-moving, we can compute the span of each car at any future turn T (where T = 16, 17, ...).\n\nLet t = T - 16, so t=0 is turn 16.\n\nThen for a car given by (h, tau, right, 6) at t1=16, at time T (t steps after) the span is:\n  [tau + 6*t, h + 6*t]\n\nWe have multiple cars per freeway. We only care when the player is on a freeway k at turn T and at that turn, 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway.\n\nWe are going to try to find a path with minimal H. Since the minimal vertical distance is 9 steps (if we could go up without stopping), but we might have to wait (use S) to avoid collisions.\n\nWe can only move one step per turn, so at least 9 turns are needed (if we go up every turn). But we might have to detour (go down) or wait, so H might be more.\n\nWe'll simulate the cars on each freeway and note the times when the freeway is blocked at x=0.\n\nFor a given freeway k and time t (relative to t1=16, so absolute turn = 16+t), we need to check if there is any car on freeway k such that:\n  0 is in [tau + 6*t, h + 6*t]   for that car.\n\nNote: the span is inclusive? The problem says \"0 in Span(T)\", so we assume inclusive.\n\nLet's compute for each freeway k the set of times t (nonnegative integers) when the freeway k is blocked (i.e., 0 is in the span of at least one car on k).\n\nWe have:\n\nFreeway 1: \n  Car1: (0, -11, right, 6) -> span at time t: [-11 + 6t, 0 + 6t] = [6t-11, 6t]\n  Car2: (48, 37, right, 6) -> [37+6t, 48+6t]\n\nWe need to check when 0 is in [6t-11, 6t] or in [37+6t, 48+6t].\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2,3,4: same as freeway 1? According to the table, freeway 1,2,3,4 have the same cars: two cars: (0,-11,right,6) and (48,37,right,6).\n\nFreeway 5,6,7,8: three cars: (0,-11,right,6), (36,25,right,6), (-42,-53,right,6)\n\nSo freeways 1-4 are identical, and freeways 5-8 are identical.\n\nTherefore, we can group:\n\nGroup A (freeways 1-4): \n  Car A1: [6t-11, 6t]\n  Car A2: [37+6t, 48+6t]\n\nGroup B (freeways 5-8):\n  Car B1: [6t-11, 6t]   (same as A1)\n  Car B2: [25+6t, 36+6t]   (from (36,25): [25+6t, 36+6t])\n  Car B3: [-53+6t, -42+6t]  (from (-42,-53): [-53+6t, -42+6t])\n\nNow, for a freeway in group A, blocked at time t if:\n  Condition A: (6t-11 <= 0 <= 6t) OR (37+6t <= 0 <= 48+6t)\n\nBut note: 0 is always nonnegative, and 37+6t and 48+6t are positive for t>=0, so the second condition is never true because 0 is not in [positive, positive] (since 37+6t >=37>0). Actually, the second condition requires 0 to be between 37+6t and 48+6t, which are both positive, so 0 is never in that interval. Similarly, for the first car: 0 is in [6t-11, 6t] if 6t-11 <= 0 <= 6t.\n\nSo for group A, blocked at time t if:\n  6t - 11 <= 0 <= 6t   -> which is equivalent to 0 <= 6t and 6t-11<=0 -> 0<=t and t<=11/6 -> t<=1.833.\n\nSince t is integer, t=0,1.\n\nCheck:\n  t=0: [6*0-11, 0] = [-11,0] -> 0 is included? Yes, because the interval is inclusive. So t=0: blocked.\n  t=1: [6*1-11, 6] = [-5,6] -> 0 is in [-5,6] -> blocked.\n  t=2: [12-11,12] = [1,12] -> 0 not in [1,12] -> safe.\n\nSo for freeways 1-4: blocked at t=0 and t=1 (relative to t1=16, so absolute turns 16 and 17) and safe for t>=2.\n\nNow group B (freeways 5-8):\n  Car B1: [6t-11, 6t] -> blocked for t=0,1 (same as above)\n  Car B2: [25+6t, 36+6t] -> both positive, so 0 is never in this interval? -> safe from this car.\n  Car B3: [-53+6t, -42+6t] -> we require 0 in this interval: \n        -53+6t <= 0 <= -42+6t\n        This is equivalent to:\n          6t >= 53   and 6t <= 42? -> but 53>42, so no solution? \n        Actually: \n          left: -53+6t <= 0 -> t <= 53/6 = 8.833 -> t <= 8\n          right: 0 <= -42+6t -> 6t>=42 -> t>=7\n        So t in [7,8] (since t integer: t=7,8)\n\n        Check:\n          t=7: [-53+42, -42+42] = [-11,0] -> 0 is included? Yes.\n          t=8: [-53+48, -42+48] = [-5,6] -> 0 is included? Yes.\n          t=9: [-53+54, -42+54] = [1,12] -> 0 not included.\n\n        So car B3 blocks at t=7 and t=8.\n\nTherefore, for group B (freeways 5-8), blocked at:\n  t=0,1 (from B1) and t=7,8 (from B3).\n\nSummary:\n\nFreeways 1-4 (group A): blocked at t=0 (turn16) and t=1 (turn17); safe for t>=2.\n\nFreeways 5-8 (group B): blocked at t=0,1,7,8.\n\nNow, we are at turn 16 (t=0) at y=0 (safe because y=0 is not a freeway). We want to be at y=9 at the last turn.\n\nWe must pass through freeways 1 to 8. We start at y=0 (turn16) and we are about to take an action at turn16 to move to the next state at turn17.\n\nNote: at turn T, we are at y_T. We take an action a_T that determines y_{T+1}.\n\nWe are at turn16: y16=0.\n\nWe are going to simulate the next turns. We want to minimize H.\n\nThe minimal H without considering cars is 9: we go up 9 times. But we have to avoid the freeways at the times they are blocked.\n\nWe need to assign a y for each turn starting from turn16 (t=0) to the turn when we reach y=9.\n\nWe must have:\n  t=0 (turn16): y=0 (safe)\n  t=1 (turn17): y1 (from action at turn16: if U then y=1, if S then y=0, if D then invalid because y0=0, D would make y=-1 -> not allowed, so only U or S at turn16? But note: the update says y_{t+1} in [0,9]. So from y=0, D would try to go to -1, but then it must be clamped? The problem says: y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y, and y_{t+1} in [0,9]. So if we do D at y=0, then y_{t+1} = max(0, -1) = 0? But the problem doesn't specify clamping. Let me check:\n\nThe problem says: \"y_{t+1} in [0,9]\". So I think we must have that the result is clamped to [0,9]. But note the update rule: \"y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t\", and then we require y_{t+1} in [0,9]. So if we try to go below 0, it should be set to 0? Similarly above 9 set to 9? \n\nBut the problem does not specify clamping. However, the condition \"y_{t+1} in [0,9]\" must hold. Therefore, if the move would take us out, we are stuck? But that would be bad. Alternatively, the game might clamp. Since the problem doesn't specify, and to avoid complication, we assume that the move is only allowed if the result is in [0,9]. So from y=0, we cannot do D because that would give y=-1 not in [0,9]. Similarly, from y=9, we cannot do U.\n\nSo at y=0, we can only do U or S.\n\nSimilarly, at y=9, we can only do D or S.\n\nIn our case, we start at y=0, so at turn16: actions allowed: U or S.\n\nWe want to get to y=9 as quickly as possible.\n\nWe are going to plan a path:\n\nWe note the constraints per freeway and per time.\n\nWe have to traverse from y=0 to y=9, and we are constrained by the freeway blocks at each time step.\n\nWe can represent the state as (time, y) and we want to go from (0,0) to (H-1,9) for some H, with minimal H.\n\nThe time is the number of steps from turn16 (so at step t, we are at turn16+t).\n\nAt time t, we are at y_t. Then we choose an action a_t (U, D, S) to go to y_{t+1} = y_t + { -1,0,1 } (if the new y is in [0,9]).\n\nAnd we must not be on a freeway k (1<=k<=8) at time t if that freeway is blocked at time t.\n\nNote: at time t, we are at y_t. So we require that if y_t is between 1 and 8, then the freeway y_t must not be blocked at time t.\n\nWe start at t=0, y0=0 (safe) and we are about to choose an action.\n\nWe want to compute the minimal H and the sequence.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nt=0: y0=0 -> safe (not on freeway)\n\nWe then choose an action for t=0 (turn16) to get y1 (at t=1).\n\nConstraints for t=1 (turn17):\n  If y1 is in [1,8], then we must not be blocked at time t=1.\n\nBut note: at t=1, freeways 1-4 are blocked, and freeways 5-8 are blocked.\n\nSo if we go to y1=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 at t=1, we are blocked? Because all freeways are blocked at t=1.\n\nTherefore, we cannot be on any freeway at t=1. So the only safe option at t=1 is to be at y1=0 or y1=9? But we start at y0=0, and we are moving at turn16 to y1. We cannot get to y1=9 in one move. So we must either stay at 0 (S) or ... but if we do S, then y1=0 -> safe (not a freeway). If we do U, then we go to y1=1 -> blocked (freeway1 is blocked at t=1). So only S is allowed at t=0 (turn16) if we want to avoid collision at t=1.\n\nBut then at t=1, we are at y1=0. Then at t=1 (turn17) we choose an action for t=1 to get y2 (at t=2).\n\nNow, at t=2: \n  Freeways 1-4: safe (because t=2>=2, so safe for group A)\n  Freeways 5-8: safe at t=2? Because group B is blocked at t=0,1,7,8 -> so t=2 is safe.\n\nTherefore, at t=2, we can be on any freeway (1-8) without being blocked.\n\nBut we are at y1=0 at t=1. We can choose to go up at t=1 (turn17) to y2=1. Then at t=2, we are at freeway1 (which is group A) and t=2 is safe for group A. So that's okay.\n\nAlternatively, we could do U again to go to y2=1 at t=2? Actually, at t=1 (turn17) we are at y1=0. We can do U to get to y2=1 at t=2.\n\nSo let's try:\n\nTurn16 (t=0): S -> y1=0 (at t=1)\nTurn17 (t=1): U -> y2=1 (at t=2)\n\nNow at t=2, we are at y2=1 (freeway1) and t=2 is safe for group A.\n\nThen we want to go up as much as possible. But note: we have to avoid group B at t=7 and t=8? But group B is freeways 5-8. So if we are going to be on freeway5,6,7,8 at t=7 or t=8, that would be blocked.\n\nBut we are at t=2 at y=1. We need to get to y=9. The minimal time from y=1 to y=9 is 8 moves (if we go up every turn). So we would be at:\n\n  t=2: y=1\n  t=3: y=2\n  t=4: y=3\n  t=5: y=4\n  t=6: y=5\n  t=7: y=6\n  t=8: y=7\n  t=9: y=8\n  t=10: y=9\n\nBut note: at t=7, we are at y=6 (freeway6, group B) and t=7 is blocked for group B -> collision.\nSimilarly, at t=8, we are at y=7 (freeway7, group B) and t=8 is blocked.\n\nSo we cannot be on group B at t=7 and t=8.\n\nTherefore, we need to adjust the path.\n\nWe have two critical times: t=7 and t=8 for group B (freeways5-8). We must not be on freeways 5,6,7,8 at t=7 and t=8.\n\nWe can either:\n  (a) Avoid being on group B at t=7 and t=8 by being either below 5 or above 8? But above 8: at t=7 we want to be at y>=9? But we can only get to y=9 by t=10 in the above plan. Alternatively, we could speed up? But we are already going up as fast as possible.\n\n  (b) Slow down so that we are not on group B at t=7,8. For example, we can wait at some safe freeway until t=9, then proceed.\n\nBut note: we can also go down? But that might take more time.\n\nLet me compute the minimal time.\n\nWe start at t=0: y=0.\n\nWe have to wait at least until t=2 to be on group A (freeways1-4) because at t=0 and t=1 we cannot be on any freeway (they are blocked). So we must be at y=0 at t=0 and t=1.\n\nAt t=2, we can be at y=1 (freeway1, safe).\n\nThen we have to go through y=2,3,4 (group A) and then y=5,6,7,8 (group B).\n\nThe group A freeways are safe for t>=2. Group B freeways are safe for all t except t=0,1,7,8. But we are not going to be on group B at t=0,1 (because we are at t>=2). So the only danger times for group B are t=7 and t=8.\n\nTherefore, we must avoid being on group B at t=7 and t=8.\n\nWe can be on group B at t=6, t=9, t=10, etc.\n\nSo we need to plan so that when t=7 and t=8, we are not on freeways 5,6,7,8.\n\nWe can be either:\n  - Below 5: so y<=4 at t=7 and t=8.\n  - Or above 8: but we are at t=7: to be at y>=9, we would have to have reached y=9 by t=7. How? From t=2 at y=1, we need 6 moves to get to y=7? But we need to get to y=9. The minimal moves from y=1 to y=9 is 8 moves. So at t=2+8 = t=10 we get to y=9. So we cannot be at y=9 by t=7.\n\nTherefore, we must be below 5 at t=7 and t=8.\n\nBut we are at t=2 at y=1. We have 5 moves to get to t=7: from t=2 to t=7 is 5 moves (t=2,3,4,5,6,7: 5 steps? Actually, at t=2 we are at y1, then we have actions at t=2,3,4,5,6 (5 actions) to get to y at t=7.\n\nWe start at t=2: y=1.\nWe can go up 5 times: then at t=7: y=6 -> which is in group B -> blocked at t=7 -> not allowed.\n\nWe must not exceed y=4 at t=7 and also at t=8.\n\nSo we can go up only 3 times from t=2 to t=7? Then we would be at y=1+3=4 at t=7? How:\n\n  t=2: y=1\n  t=3: y=2 (after U at t=2)\n  t=4: y=3 (U)\n  t=5: y=4 (U) -> then we have two more moves: at t=5 and t=6.\n\nBut we need to be at y<=4 at t=7. So at t=6 we can be at y<=4? And then at t=7 we can choose to stay or move.\n\nActually, we can be at y=4 at t=7 by:\n\n  t=2: y=1 -> action U -> y=2 at t=3\n  t=3: y=2 -> U -> y=3 at t=4\n  t=4: y=3 -> U -> y=4 at t=5\n  t=5: y=4 -> now we have to avoid going above 4 until after t=8? But we have two turns (t=5 and t=6) to use before t=7.\n\nWe can do:\n  t=5: S -> y=4 at t=6\n  t=6: S -> y=4 at t=7\n\nThen at t=7: we are at y=4 (freeway4, group A) -> safe because group A is safe for t>=2.\n\nThen at t=7: we are at y=4. Now we can start moving up. But note: at t=8, we must not be on group B. So we have to avoid being at y>=5 at t=8.\n\nAt t=7: we are at y=4. We can do:\n  U -> y=5 at t=8 -> but at t=8, y=5 (freeway5, group B) is blocked -> not allowed.\n  S -> y=4 at t=8 -> safe (group A)\n  D -> y=3 at t=8 -> safe (group A, but freeway3 is group A) but that would be moving backward.\n\nSo we can do S at t=7 to stay at y=4 at t=8.\n\nBut then we are still at y=4 at t=8. Then at t=8: we can start moving up? But we have to get to y=9.\n\nFrom t=8: y=4, we need 5 moves to get to y=9: \n  t=8: y=4 -> U: y=5 at t=9\n  t=9: U: y=6 at t=10\n  t=10: U: y=7 at t=11\n  t=11: U: y=8 at t=12\n  t=12: U: y=9 at t=13\n\nBut note: at t=9, we are at y=5 (group B) and t=9 is safe for group B (because group B is only blocked at t=0,1,7,8). So t=9 is safe. Similarly, t=10,11,12 are safe.\n\nSo total turns: \n  We start at turn16 (t=0) and we end at turn16 + H - 1 = t=13? \n  H is the number of actions? The sequence is from turn16 to turn16+H-1. We have actions from t=0 to t=12 (13 actions) and then at t=13 we are at y=9? \n\nBut note: the player position at turn T is after taking the action at T-1? \n\nActually, we are at turn T: the state at turn T is after the action at turn T-1.\n\nWe start at turn16: we are at (0,0). Then we take an action at turn16 to get to turn17, etc.\n\nWe want to be at (0,9) at turn16+H-1.\n\nIn our plan:\n\n  turn16 (t=0): action S -> then at turn17: y=0\n  turn17 (t=1): action S? Actually, we had planned:\n      t=0 (turn16): S -> y1=0 (at turn17)\n      t=1 (turn17): U -> y2=1 (at turn18)\n\nBut above I then said at t=2 (turn18) we are at y=1.\n\nThen:\n\n  turn18 (t=2): U -> y=2 at turn19 (t=3)\n  turn19 (t=3): U -> y=3 at turn20 (t=4)\n  turn20 (t=4): U -> y=4 at turn21 (t=5)\n  turn21 (t=5): S -> y=4 at turn22 (t=6)\n  turn22 (t=6): S -> y=4 at turn23 (t=7)\n  turn23 (t=7): S -> y=4 at turn24 (t=8)\n  turn24 (t=8): U -> y=5 at turn25 (t=9)\n  turn25 (t=9): U -> y=6 at turn26 (t=10)\n  turn26 (t=10): U -> y=7 at turn27 (t=11)\n  turn27 (t=11): U -> y=8 at turn28 (t=12)\n  turn28 (t=12): U -> y=9 at turn29 (t=13)\n\nSo we reach y=9 at turn29. Therefore, H = number of actions = 13? \nThe sequence has actions from turn16 to turn28 (inclusive) -> 13 actions.\n\nBut we can try to optimize: we wasted two turns at y=4 (t=5 and t=6) and one more at t=7 and t=8? Actually, at t=5,6,7,8 we are at y=4.\n\nBut we could have moved earlier? However, we cannot be at group B at t=7 and t=8.\n\nAlternatively, we could go up faster initially and then wait at a safe spot in group B? But group B is unsafe at t=7,8. So we have to be below group B at t=7,8.\n\nBut note: we are at t=2 at y=1. We have 5 moves until t=7. We can go up 4 moves to get to y=5 at t=6? Then we cannot stay at y=5 at t=6? Because at t=6, group B is safe? But then at t=7 we have to leave y=5? But we can only move one step.\n\nSo:\n\n  t=2: y=1 -> U: y=2 at t=3\n  t=3: U: y=3 at t=4\n  t=4: U: y=4 at t=5\n  t=5: U: y=5 at t=6 -> now at t=6: freeway5 is group B, and t=6 is safe? Yes, because group B is only blocked at t=0,1,7,8.\n\n  Then at t=6: we are at y=5. Now we have to avoid being at y=5,6,7,8 at t=7. So at t=6, we can only move to y=4,5,6? But we are at y=5. \n    If we do U: y=6 at t=7 -> blocked (t=7, group B)\n    If we do S: y=5 at t=7 -> blocked\n    If we do D: y=4 at t=7 -> safe (group A)\n\n  So we do D at t=6: then at t=7: y=4 (safe).\n\n  Then at t=7: we are at y=4. Now we must avoid being at group B at t=8? \n    At t=7: we can do:\n        U: y=5 at t=8 -> blocked (because t=8, group B blocked)\n        S: y=4 at t=8 -> safe\n        D: y=3 at t=8 -> safe\n\n  We want to go up eventually, so we do S? Then at t=8: y=4.\n\n  Then at t=8: we can start going up: \n        t=8: U -> y=5 at t=9 (safe, because t=9 group B safe)\n        then we go up each turn until y=9.\n\nBut let's count:\n\n  t=0: y=0 (turn16: we do S? Actually, we have to do S at turn16 to avoid going to freeway at t=1? But we already did S at turn16 to get to y=0 at turn17? But wait, we started at y=0 at turn16. Then at turn16 we did S to stay at y=0 at turn17.\n\nBut we can avoid that? We had to be at y=0 at t=1 (because we cannot be on freeway at t=1). But we are already at y=0 at t=0. So if we do nothing? Actually, we have to choose an action at turn16: we can choose S to stay at y=0 for turn17.\n\nBut what if we do nothing at turn16? Then we are at y=0 at turn17? Actually, the action at turn16 determines the state at turn17.\n\nSo we must do S at turn16 to be at y=0 at turn17.\n\nThen at turn17 (t=1): we are at y=0. Then we do U to go to y=1 at turn18 (t=2).\n\nNow the plan with the detour:\n\n  turn16 (t=0): S -> y=0 at turn17 (t=1)\n  turn17 (t=1): U -> y=1 at turn18 (t=2)\n  turn18 (t=2): U -> y=2 at turn19 (t=3)\n  turn19 (t=3): U -> y=3 at turn20 (t=4)\n  turn20 (t=4): U -> y=4 at turn21 (t=5)\n  turn21 (t=5): U -> y=5 at turn22 (t=6)   [now at group B, t=6: safe]\n  turn22 (t=6): D -> y=4 at turn23 (t=7)   [to avoid being at group B at t=7: now at group A, safe]\n  turn23 (t=7): S -> y=4 at turn24 (t=8)   [safe, group A]\n  turn24 (t=8): U -> y=5 at turn25 (t=9)   [safe, group B at t=9: safe]\n  turn25 (t=9): U -> y=6 at turn26 (t=10)\n  turn26 (t=10): U -> y=7 at turn27 (t=11)\n  turn27 (t=11): U -> y=8 at turn28 (t=12)\n  turn28 (t=12): U -> y=9 at turn29 (t=13)\n\nSo again, we get to y=9 at turn29 -> H=13.\n\nBut we did a down move at turn22. Is there a way without going down? \n\nWe could wait at y=4 until t=8? Then we don't go to y=5 until t=8? But then we are at y=4 at t=7 and t=8, and then go up. But that is the first plan.\n\nAlternatively, we can go up to y=4 at t=5, then wait until t=8 at y=4, then go up. That also takes 13 moves.\n\nBut note: we have to get from y=0 to y=9: minimal 9 moves. But we have to wait for the safe times. We have 4 extra moves: two at the beginning (t=0 and t=1: we are stuck at y=0) and then two at the middle (waiting at y=4 for two turns? Actually, in the first plan we waited at y=4 for three turns: t=5,6,7? But in the first plan we were at y=4 from t=5 to t=8: that's 4 turns? Actually:\n\n  We got to y=4 at t=5 (turn21) and then we stayed until t=8 (turn24): so turns t=5,6,7,8: that's 4 turns? But we only need to avoid group B at t=7 and t=8. So we can be at y=4 at t=5,6,7,8: but that is 4 turns. We could have gone up to y=4 at t=5 and then at t=6 we could have done something else? \n\nBut we cannot go up at t=6 because then we would be at y=5 at t=7? which is blocked. So we have to wait at y=4 until after t=8? But at t=8 we can then move.\n\nBut note: at t=8 we are still at y=4, then we move up to y=5 at t=9. So we are stuck at y=4 for 4 turns? That seems inefficient.\n\nCan we go up to a higher freeway in group A? We are at y=4 (freeway4) at t=5. Then we have to wait until t=9 to start moving through group B? But we can only be at group A until y=4. \n\nAlternatively, we can go up to y=5 at a safe time? The safe times for group B are t=2,3,4,5,6,9,10,... \n\nWe can be at group B at t=6? Then we have to leave by t=7? So we can be at group B at t=6 and then drop back to group A at t=7? \n\nBut we already did that in the second plan: we went to y=5 at t=6 and then dropped to y=4 at t=7.\n\nBut that still took 13 moves.\n\nIs there a way to save a move?\n\nWe start at y=0 at t=0 and t=1 (we have to be there). Then we go up to y=1 at t=2, y=2 at t=3, y=3 at t=4, y=4 at t=5.\n\nNow, we have to spend t=5,6,7,8 somewhere without being on group B at t=7,8.\n\nBut we can only be at group A (y=1,2,3,4) or at y=0 or y=9? But we are at y=4. We could go down? But that would be counterproductive.\n\nAlternatively, we could have gone slower at the beginning? For example, stay at y=0 for an extra turn? But we are already forced to stay at y=0 for t=0 and t=1.\n\nAnother idea: can we reach y=4 earlier? We start at y=0 at t=1. Then at t=2: we go to y=1, t=3: y=2, t=4: y=3, t=5: y=4 -> that's the earliest we can get to y=4.\n\nThen we have to wait until t=9 to start going through group B? But we can start going through group B at t=6, as long as we leave by t=7? \n\nBut we have to cover the distance: from y=4 to y=9: 5 moves. We can do:\n\n  t=5: y=4 -> we can go to y=5 at t=6 (safe for group B at t=6)\n  t=6: we are at y=5 -> then we must go back to y=4 at t=7? \n        But then we haven't progressed.\n\nAlternatively, we can go from y=4 at t=5 to y=5 at t=6, then at t=6 we go up to y=6? But that would put us at y=6 at t=7 -> blocked.\n\nWe cannot.\n\nWe must be at a freeway <=4 at t=7 and t=8.\n\nSo we are stuck at y=4 for t=5,6,7,8? Then at t=8 we are at y=4, and then we go up:\n\n  t=8: U -> y=5 at t=9\n  t=9: U -> y=6 at t=10\n  t=10: U -> y=7 at t=11\n  t=11: U -> y=8 at t=12\n  t=12: U -> y=9 at t=13\n\nThat is 5 moves from t=8 to t=13. And we were at y=4 at t=5 to t=8: that's 4 turns (t=5,6,7,8) at y=4.\n\nBut we can leave y=4 at t=8? So we are at y=4 at t=5,6,7,8: that's 4 turns. Then we go up 5 times: from t=8 to t=13.\n\nTotal turns: from t=0 to t=13: 14 states? But we count the actions: from turn16 to turn28: 13 actions? \n\nWe have:\n\n  t (relative) | turn | y\n  0: turn16: y=0 -> action: S\n  1: turn17: y=0 -> action: U\n  2: turn18: y=1 -> action: U\n  3: turn19: y=2 -> action: U\n  4: turn20: y=3 -> action: U\n  5: turn21: y=4 -> action: S (or we could do S for multiple turns)\n  6: turn22: y=4 -> action: S\n  7: turn23: y=4 -> action: S\n  8: turn24: y=4 -> action: U\n  9: turn25: y=5 -> action: U\n  10: turn26: y=6 -> action: U\n  11: turn27: y=7 -> action: U\n  12: turn28: y=8 -> action: U\n  13: turn29: y=9\n\nSo we take 13 actions (from turn16 to turn28) and we are at y=9 at turn29. So H=13.\n\nBut we can reduce the waiting time? We only need to avoid group B at t=7 and t=8. We are at y=4 at t=5,6,7,8. We could leave y=4 at t=8 to go up? But we are already doing that.\n\nWe could at t=7 or t=8 go down? But that would be worse.\n\nAnother idea: after t=8, we are safe to go through group B. We can try to go faster? But we are going up every turn.\n\nWe can only move one per turn.\n\nBut note: we are at y=4 at t=8. We need to get to y=9: that takes 5 moves. So we must have at least 5 turns after t=8.\n\nThe minimal H is then: we start at t=0, and we have to be at y=4 by t=5 (which takes 5 moves: but note we start at y=0 at t=0, and we move 4 moves to get to y=4 at t=5). Then we wait 3 turns (t=5,6,7) and then at t=8 we start moving? But we have to be at y=4 at t=8? \n\nActually, we can be at y=4 at t=5, then we can leave at any time? But we have to be at y<=4 at t=7 and t=8. So we can be at y=4 at t=5 and then move to y=3 at t=6? But that would be worse.\n\nWe have to be at a state <=4 at t=7 and t=8. We can be at different freeways. For example:\n\n  At t=7: y=3\n  At t=8: y=4\n\nBut then we can do:\n\n  t=5: y=4 -> then we can move down to y=3 at t=6? \n  t=6: y=3 -> then at t=7: we can be at y=3 (safe) \n        then at t=7: we do U to y=4 at t=8 (safe) \n        then at t=8: y=4 -> then we go up as before.\n\nBut we saved one turn? Because we were not waiting? But we are still at y=4 at t=5 and then we moved down and then up, so we are still at y=4 at t=8? We haven't progressed.\n\nSo it doesn't help.\n\nAlternatively, we can be at y=4 at t=5, then we can go down to y=3 at t=6, then down to y=2 at t=7, then down to y=1 at t=8? That would be bad because then we have to climb back.\n\nSo it is better to stay at y=4.\n\nBut we are forced to wait 3 turns? Actually, from t=5 to t=8: we have to be at y<=4. We are at y=4 at t=5. Then we can stay at y=4 for t=6,7,8? That's 3 turns (actions at t=5,6,7: S,S,S) to remain at y=4. Then at t=8: we go up.\n\nBut that's 3 extra turns? Plus the 5 moves to go from y=4 to y=9, and the 5 moves to get to y=4 from y=0 (but note we had two moves at the beginning: turn16 and turn17 to get from y=0 to y=0 and then y=0 to y=1? Actually, we have:\n\n  Moves to get from y=0 (t=0) to y=4 (t=5): \n      t=0: S (stay at y=0) -> one move\n      t=1: U (to y=1) -> one move\n      t=2: U (y=2)\n      t=3: U (y=3)\n      t=4: U (y=4) -> so 5 moves to get to y=4 at t=5.\n\n  Then we do 3 moves (S at t=5, S at t=6, S at t=7) to remain at y=4 for t=6,7,8? \n      Actually, at t=5: we are at y=4, then we do S: at t=6 we are still at y=4.\n      Then at t=6: S -> t=7: y=4\n      Then at t=7: S -> t=8: y=4\n      So we did 3 S's.\n\n  Then we do 5 U's: from t=8 to t=12: \n        t=8: U -> t=9: y=5\n        t=9: U -> t=10: y=6\n        t=10: U -> t=11: y=7\n        t=11: U -> t=12: y=8\n        t=12: U -> t=13: y=9\n\nTotal moves: 5 (to get to y=4) + 3 (waiting) + 5 (to y=9) = 13 moves.\n\nWe must do 13 moves.\n\nBut is there a way to do 12? \n\nSuppose we try to be at y=5 at t=6, then drop to y=4 at t=7, then at t=7 we are at y=4, and then at t=8 we can go to y=5? But then we are at y=5 at t=9? \n\nBut we still need to cover from y=5 to y=9: 4 moves -> from t=9 to t=13: \n  t=9: y=5\n  t=10: y=6\n  t=11: y=7\n  t=12: y=8\n  t=13: y=9\n\nBut we did 13 moves again.\n\nAnd the initial part:\n\n  t=0: S (y=0 at t=1)\n  t=1: U (y=1 at t=2)\n  t=2: U (y=2 at t=3)\n  t=3: U (y=3 at t=4)\n  t=4: U (y=4 at t=5)\n  t=5: U (y=5 at t=6)   -> this is the fifth move? Then we have the drop and then the climb.\n\nTotal moves: \n  from t=0 to t=5: 5 moves (to y=5 at t=6)\n  then t=5: action U -> y=5 at t=6\n  then t=6: D -> y=4 at t=7\n  then t=7: U -> y=5 at t=8? But wait, at t=7 we are at y=4. Then at t=7 we do U: at t=8 we are at y=5 -> blocked! because t=8 group B is blocked.\n\nSo we cannot do that. We must not be at group B at t=8.\n\nSo at t=8, we must be at y<=4.\n\nTherefore, after dropping to y=4 at t=7, we must not go up at t=7? We must stay or go down.\n\nSo:\n\n  t=6: D -> y=4 at t=7\n  t=7: S -> y=4 at t=8\n  t=8: U -> y=5 at t=9\n  ...\n\nThen we have:\n\n  moves: \n    t=0: S\n    t=1: U\n    t=2: U\n    t=3: U\n    t=4: U\n    t=5: U   [y=5 at t=6]\n    t=6: D   [y=4 at t=7]\n    t=7: S   [y=4 at t=8]\n    t=8: U   [y=5 at t=9]\n    t=9: U   [y=6 at t=10]\n    t=10: U  [y=7 at t=11]\n    t=11: U  [y=8 at t=12]\n    t=12: U  [y=9 at t=13]\n\nThat's 13 moves.\n\nSo it seems 13 is the minimal.\n\nBut let's see if we can be at y=9 earlier by being faster in the group B section? No, because we need 5 moves from y=4 to y=9.\n\nAlternatively, can we get to y=4 earlier? We start at y=0 at t=0 and t=1. We can't get to y=4 before t=5? Because it takes 4 moves to go from y=0 to y=4, but we have to spend the first two turns at y=0. So the earliest to be at y=4 is t=5.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 13.\n\nNow, we can write the sequence.\n\nWe have two valid sequences:\n\nOption 1 (wait at y=4 for 4 turns):\n\n  turn16: S\n  turn17: U\n  turn18: U\n  turn19: U\n  turn20: U\n  turn21: S\n  turn22: S\n  turn23: S\n  turn24: U\n  turn25: U\n  turn26: U\n  turn27: U\n  turn28: U\n\nBut this gets to y=9 at turn29. And we have 13 actions.\n\nOption 2 (go up to y=5 and then drop to y=4 and then wait one more):\n\n  turn16: S\n  turn17: U\n  turn18: U\n  turn19: U\n  turn20: U\n  turn21: U   [to y=5 at turn22]\n  turn22: D   [back to y=4 at turn23]\n  turn23: S   [stay at y=4 at turn24]\n  turn24: U   [to y=5 at turn25]\n  turn25: U\n  turn26: U\n  turn27: U\n  turn28: U   [to y=9 at turn29]\n\nBut this has 13 actions too.\n\nWhich one is better? Both have the same H.\n\nBut we prefer a sequence without going down? Option 1 does not go down.\n\nOption 1:\n\n  Actions: S, U, U, U, U, S, S, S, U, U, U, U, U\n\nOption 2: S, U, U, U, U, U, D, S, U, U, U, U, U\n\nBoth 13 moves.\n\nWe can choose either. Let me choose Option 1.\n\nBut in Option 1, we are at y=4 from turn21 to turn24 (inclusive) for 4 turns? Actually:\n\n  turn16: S -> y17=0\n  turn17: U -> y18=1\n  turn18: U -> y19=2\n  turn19: U -> y20=3\n  turn20: U -> y21=4\n  turn21: S -> y22=4\n  turn22: S -> y23=4\n  turn23: S -> y24=4\n  turn24: U -> y25=5\n  turn25: U -> y26=6\n  turn26: U -> y27=7\n  turn27: U -> y28=8\n  turn28: U -> y29=9\n\nSo we are at y=4 for turns21,22,23,24? That's 4 turns: turn21,22,23,24.\n\nBut we only needed to avoid group B at turns23 and turn24? Actually, in absolute turns: \n  t=0: turn16 -> y=0\n  t=1: turn17 -> y=0\n  t=2: turn18 -> y=1\n  t=3: turn19 -> y=2\n  t=4: turn20 -> y=3\n  t=5: turn21 -> y=4\n  t=6: turn22 -> y=4\n  t=7: turn23 -> y=4   [here t=7: which is critical for group B? But we are at group A, safe]\n  t=8: turn24 -> y=4   [t=8: critical, but we are at group A, safe]\n  t=9: turn25 -> y=5   [safe for group B]\n\nSo it works.\n\nBut note: at turn24 (t=8) we are at y=4. Then we do U to go to y=5 at turn25 (t=9).\n\nSo the sequence is:\n\nTurn 16: S\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\nTurn 19: U\nTurn 20: U\nTurn 21: S\nTurn 22: S\nTurn 23: S\nTurn 24: U\nTurn 25: U\nTurn 26: U\nTurn 27: U\nTurn 28: U\n\nBut wait, we are at y=4 at turn21,22,23,24. Then we do U at turn24 to get to y=5 at turn25. Then we do U at turn25 to y=6, etc.\n\nThis is 13 actions.\n\nWe can also do:\n\n  turn21: S -> stay at y=4 for turn22\n  turn22: S -> stay for turn23\n  turn23: S -> stay for turn24\n  turn24: U -> to y=5 at turn25\n\nBut we have three S's at turn21,22,23.\n\nAlternatively, we could do at turn23: U? But then we would go to y=5 at turn24 -> and turn24 is t=8, which is blocked for group B. So we cannot.\n\nSo we must do S at turn23.\n\nTherefore, the sequence above is valid.\n\nBut let me confirm the last turn: we do U at turn28 to get to y=9 at turn29. And we are done.\n\nSo the minimal H is 13.\n\nNow, to write the answer:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 16: S\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\nTurn 19: U\nTurn 20: U\nTurn 21: S\nTurn 22: S\nTurn 23: S\nTurn 24: U\nTurn 25: U\nTurn 26: U\nTurn 27: U\nTurn 28: U\n}\n\nBut the problem asks for a sequence of actions from turn16 to turn16+H-1, which is 13 actions: turn16 to turn28.\n\nAnd we reach (0,9) at turn29, which is after the last action.\n\nThis sequence has 13 actions.\n\nWe could also use the other sequence (with a down move) but it has the same length.\n\nI think this is acceptable.\n\nLet me double-check the collisions:\n\nAt turn16: y=0 -> safe\nAt turn17: y=0 (after S at turn16) -> safe\nAt turn18: y=1 (after U at turn17) -> freeway1, t=2 (relative: t=2) -> safe for group A (t>=2 safe)\nAt turn19: y=2 -> freeway2, group A, t=3 (safe)\nAt turn20: y=3 -> freeway3, group A, t=4 (safe)\nAt turn21: y=4 -> freeway4, group A, t=5 (safe)\nAt turn22: y=4 -> freeway4, group A, t=6 (safe)\nAt turn23: y=4 -> freeway4, group A, t=7 (safe)\nAt turn24: y=4 -> freeway4, group A, t=8 (safe)\nAt turn25: y=5 -> freeway5, group B, t=9 (safe, because group B blocked at t=0,1,7,8 -> t=9 safe)\nAt turn26: y=6 -> freeway6, group B, t=10 (safe)\nAt turn27: y=7 -> freeway7, group B, t=11 (safe)\nAt turn28: y=8 -> freeway8, group B, t=12 (safe)\nAt turn29: y=9 -> safe (not a freeway)\n\nSo no collisions.\n\nTherefore, the answer is the sequence above.\n</think>\nTo reach the position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 0) at turn 16 while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 13. The sequence of actions is designed to navigate around the blocked freeway times:\n\n- Freeways 1–4 (group A) are blocked at turns 16 and 17 (relative times \\(t = 0\\) and \\(t = 1\\)) and safe thereafter.\n- Freeways 5–8 (group B) are blocked at turns 16, 17, 23, and 24 (relative times \\(t = 0, 1, 7, 8\\)) and safe otherwise.\n\nThe player starts at \\(y = 0\\) (safe) at turn 16. To avoid being on any freeway (1–8) at the blocked turns 16 and 17, the player must remain at \\(y = 0\\) for turns 16 and 17. This is achieved by:\n- **Turn 16**: Stay (S), resulting in \\(y = 0\\) at turn 17.\n\nAt turn 17, the player is still at \\(y = 0\\) and can move up. From turn 18 onward, the player moves up to \\(y = 4\\) as quickly as possible, as group A is safe for \\(t \\geq 2\\) (turns 18+). The player reaches \\(y = 4\\) at turn 21.\n\nThe player must avoid being on group B freeways (5–8) at turns 23 and 24. Thus, the player stays at \\(y = 4\\) (group A, safe) for turns 21, 22, and 23:\n- **Turn 21**: Stay (S), resulting in \\(y = 4\\) at turn 22.\n- **Turn 22**: Stay (S), resulting in \\(y = 4\\) at turn 23.\n- **Turn 23**: Stay (S), resulting in \\(y = 4\\) at turn 24.\n\nAfter turn 24, group B is safe. The player then moves up consecutively to reach \\(y = 9\\):\n- **Turn 24**: Up (U), to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 25.\n- **Turn 25**: Up (U), to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 26.\n- **Turn 26**: Up (U), to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 27.\n- **Turn 27**: Up (U), to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 28.\n- **Turn 28**: Up (U), to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 29.\n\nThis sequence ensures the player reaches (0, 9) at turn 29 (after 13 actions) without collisions, as verified by the freeway safety at each turn.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 16: S \\\\\nTurn 17: U \\\\\nTurn 18: U \\\\\nTurn 19: U \\\\\nTurn 20: U \\\\\nTurn 21: S \\\\\nTurn 22: S \\\\\nTurn 23: S \\\\\nTurn 24: U \\\\\nTurn 25: U \\\\\nTurn 26: U \\\\\nTurn 27: U \\\\\nTurn 28: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 17, and the player is at (0,0). The goal is to reach (0,9) in minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T only if the player is on a freeway y (which is from 1 to 8) and at that same turn T, for any car on that freeway, the car's span at turn T includes 0.\n\nNote: The player updates their position at the same time as the cars move. When the player moves from y_t to y_{t+1} at turn t, then at turn t they are still on the old row, and at turn t+1 they are on the new row.\n\nImportant: At turn T, the player is on row y_T. So if at turn T the player is on a freeway row k (1<=k<=8), then we must check the cars on freeway k at turn T.\n\nThe car update:\nFor a car at turn t1 (current turn) with head h, tail tau, direction d, speed s:\n- Left-moving: d = left -> the car moves to the left. Then at turn T (>=t1), the span is [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\n- Right-moving: d = right -> the car moves to the right. Then at turn T (>=t1), the span is [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]   [Note: for right-moving, the head is the rightmost? Actually, the input for right-moving cars is given as (head, tail) but in the update for right-moving, we see that at turn T the span becomes [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)] meaning that the tail (which was the left end) becomes the new left end? Actually, the representation for a right-moving car is given as (head, tail) but head is the front? However, in the update rule, it says:\n  - Right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [tau, h] -> Span(T) = [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\"\nBut in the input, the car is given as (head, tail). So for a right-moving car, the head is the larger coordinate? Because the update rule says that at t1, the span is [tau, h] meaning tau <= h? And then at T, it becomes [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving: at t1, the span is [h, tau] and then at T: [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]. So for left-moving, h is the leftmost? But note that the input for left-moving is also (head, tail). However, in the update rule for left-moving, the head is the left end? Actually, the problem states:\n  - Left-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, tau] -> ...\", so h is the left end and tau is the right end? But then the car would be moving left? Actually, if the car is moving left, then the entire car shifts left.\n\nBut note: in the input, all cars in this state are right-moving. So we only have right-moving cars.\n\nFor a right-moving car at turn t1 with (head, tail) = (h, tau), the initial span at t1 is [tau, h] (so tau <= h). Then at turn T, the span is [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n\nCollision condition: at turn T, if the player is on freeway k (so y_T = k) and there is a car on freeway k such that 0 is in the span [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n\nWe are at turn t1 = 17. We need to plan from t=17 to t=17+H-1, and at turn 17+H-1 we are at row 9.\n\nThe player starts at row 0 (which is not a freeway, so no collision at row 0). The goal is row 9 (also not a freeway).\n\nWe can only move one row per turn (or stay). So we need to go from row 0 to row 9: we have to traverse rows 1 to 8. But at each of these rows, we must avoid the cars.\n\nWe are to find the minimal H and the sequence of actions (each U, D, S) such that after H turns (i.e., at turn t1+H-1) we are at 9.\n\nNote: the player's position at the start of turn t1 is (0,0). Then we choose an action for turn t1: that action will determine y_{t1+1}. But note: during turn t1, we are still at row 0. Then at turn t1+1, we are at row y_{t1+1} (which is 0,1, or -1? but note y in [0,9] so if we are at 0 and do D, we stay at 0). So:\n\nAt turn t1 (17): we are at (0,0). We choose an action for this turn. Then:\n- If we choose S: then at turn 18, we are still at 0.\n- If we choose U: then at turn 18, we are at 1.\n- If we choose D: then at turn 18, we are at 0 (because we cannot go below 0).\n\nSimilarly, at any turn, if we are at y and choose D, then next y is max(0, y-1). But the problem says y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta, and y_{t+1} in [0,9]. So if we are at 0 and do D, we get 0. Similarly, at 9 and U, we get 9.\n\nWe are starting at 0 and want to get to 9. So we must use U actions. But we can also use S to wait and D to go down if needed? But going down from 0 doesn't help. So we will mainly use U and S.\n\nThe challenge is to avoid the cars on rows 1-8 at the times we are on those rows.\n\nWe are to compute the car positions at any future turn T (>=17) for each car.\n\nGiven the car state at turn 17:\n\nFor freeway 1: two cars: (6, -5, right, 6) and (54, 43, right, 6)\nFor freeway 2: same two cars: (6, -5, right, 6) and (54, 43, right, 6)\nFor freeway 3: same\nFor freeway 4: same\nFor freeway 5: three cars: (6, -5, right, 6), (42,31,right,6), (-36,-47,right,6)\nFor freeway 6: same three cars\nFor freeway 7: same three cars\nFor freeway 8: same three cars\n\nNote: the freeways 1-4 have two cars, and freeways 5-8 have three cars.\n\nLet me compute the span for each car at turn T (relative to turn t1=17):\n\nFor a car (head, tail, direction, speed) = (h, tau, d, s) at t1=17, at turn T (>=17):\n  Since all are right-moving: \n      left_end(T) = tau + s*(T-17)\n      right_end(T) = h + s*(T-17)\n\nCollision at freeway k at turn T happens if the player is on row k at turn T and there exists a car on freeway k such that:\n   left_end(T) <= 0 <= right_end(T)\n\nWe need to avoid that.\n\nWe are going to move from row 0 to row 9. We can only move one row per turn (if we do U) or stay. So the minimal H without cars would be 9: we do U 9 times and then we are at row 9 at turn 17+9-1 = turn 25? \n\nWait: \nAt turn 17: we start at row 0.\nWe take an action at turn 17: then at turn 18 we are at row (0+action). So to get to row 9, we need 9 upward moves. But we can also wait (S) at some rows. So the minimal number of turns is at least 9.\n\nBut we have to avoid the cars. So we might need to wait at some safe rows.\n\nWe are to find the minimal H. We can try to see if we can do it in 9 turns. Then we would be moving up every turn.\n\nLet me denote the turns: \nTurn 17: at row 0 -> action U: then at turn 18 we are at row 1.\nTurn 18: at row 1 -> action U: then at turn 19 we are at row 2.\n...\nTurn 25: at turn 25 we are at row 8? Then we need one more to get to row 9? \n\nActually:\n- Turn 17: we start at row 0. We take an action at turn 17 that will determine row at turn 18.\n- After 1 action (at turn 18): row = 1\n- After 2 actions: row=2 at turn 19\n- ...\n- After 8 actions: row=8 at turn 25\n- After 9 actions: row=9 at turn 26.\n\nSo if we do 9 consecutive U actions starting at turn 17, then:\n  At turn 17: we are at row 0 (safe)\n  At turn 18: row 1 -> check freeway 1 at turn 18\n  At turn 19: row 2 -> check freeway 2 at turn 19\n  ...\n  At turn 25: row 8 -> check freeway 8 at turn 25\n  At turn 26: row 9 -> goal (safe, because freeways are 1-8)\n\nSo we need to check for each row k at turn (17 + k) whether it is safe? Actually, the row we are on at turn T is the row we check at turn T.\n\nFor row 1 at turn 18: \n  Check freeway 1: cars at turn 18 (T=18, so T-17=1)\n    Car1: (h=6, tau=-5, d=right, s=6) -> \n        left_end(18) = -5 + 6*1 = 1\n        right_end(18) = 6 + 6*1 = 12\n        So span [1,12] -> does 0 fall in [1,12]? No. So safe for this car.\n    Car2: (54,43,right,6) -> \n        left_end(18) = 43+6=49\n        right_end(18)=54+6=60 -> 0 not in [49,60] -> safe.\n\nSo row1 at turn18 is safe.\n\nRow2 at turn19: \n  Freeway2: same cars as freeway1? \n    Car1: at turn19 (T=19, T-17=2): \n        left_end = -5+6*2 = 7, right_end=6+12=18 -> [7,18] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n    Car2: 43+12=55, 54+12=66 -> safe.\n\nRow3 at turn20: \n  Freeway3: same cars -> \n        Car1: -5+18=13, 6+18=24 -> [13,24] -> safe.\n        Car2: 43+18=61, 54+18=72 -> safe.\n\nRow4 at turn21:\n  Freeway4: same -> \n        Car1: -5+24=19, 6+24=30 -> safe.\n        Car2: 43+24=67, 54+24=78 -> safe.\n\nNow row5 at turn22:\n  Freeway5 has three cars: \n    Car1: (6,-5,right,6) -> at T=22: left_end=-5+6*(5)= -5+30=25, right_end=6+30=36 -> [25,36] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n    Car2: (42,31,right,6) -> left_end=31+30=61, right_end=42+30=72 -> safe.\n    Car3: (-36,-47,right,6) -> left_end=-47+30=-17, right_end=-36+30=-6 -> [-17,-6] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\nRow6 at turn23:\n  Freeway6: same three cars at T=23 (T-17=6)\n    Car1: -5+6*6=-5+36=31, 6+36=42 -> [31,42] -> safe.\n    Car2: 31+36=67, 42+36=78 -> safe.\n    Car3: -47+36=-11, -36+36=0 -> [-11,0] -> 0 is included? \n        The interval is from -11 to 0. Since it is a closed interval? The problem says \"0 in the span\". So 0 is in [-11,0] -> collision.\n\nSo if we are at row6 at turn23, we collide with car3 on freeway6.\n\nTherefore, going straight up without waiting leads to a collision at turn23 (on row6).\n\nWe must avoid that. So we need to adjust.\n\nWe can try to wait at some row until the car passes.\n\nBut note: we are at row5 at turn22. Then at turn22 we can choose to do S (stay at row5) or D (go down to row4) or U (go to row6). But if we go to row6 at turn23, we collide. So we must not go to row6 at turn23.\n\nOptions at turn22 (we are at row5):\n  Option 1: Stay at row5 (do S at turn22) -> then at turn23 we are still at row5.\n  Option 2: Go down to row4 (do D at turn22) -> then at turn23 we are at row4.\n\nBut we want to go up eventually. So let's see what happens if we wait at row5 for one turn.\n\nAt turn23: we are at row5 (if we did S at turn22). Then we check freeway5 at turn23 (T=23, T-17=6) for the cars on freeway5:\n\n  Car1: (6,-5,right,6): left_end = -5+6*6=31, right_end=6+36=42 -> [31,42] -> safe.\n  Car2: (42,31,right,6): [31+36=67, 42+36=78] -> safe.\n  Car3: (-36,-47,right,6): [-47+36=-11, -36+36=0] -> 0 is in [-11,0] -> but wait, we are on freeway5 at turn23? \n        The car is on freeway5? Yes. And we are on freeway5 at turn23? Yes. \n        So if we are at row5 at turn23, then we collide? \n\nBut note: the car3 at freeway5 at turn23 has span [-11,0]. This car is moving right. The freeway is row5. The player is at (0,5) at turn23. The collision condition is: 0 in the span of the car? Yes, because 0 is in [-11,0]. \n\nTherefore, row5 at turn23 is also unsafe? \n\nWait: the car is at freeway5 at turn23 and its span includes 0? Then if the player is on freeway5 at turn23, there is a collision.\n\nSo if we stay at row5 at turn22, then at turn23 we are at row5 and collide? \n\nBut at turn22 we were at row5? Then at turn22 we were safe? Yes, because at turn22 (T=22, T-17=5) for car3: \n  left_end = -47+6*5 = -47+30=-17, right_end=-36+30=-6 -> [-17,-6] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\nBut if we do S at turn22, then at turn23 we are still at row5 and the car has moved: now at T=23, the car3 has moved to [-11,0] -> 0 is included -> collision.\n\nTherefore, we cannot stay at row5 at turn22? Then what? \n\nWe could go back to row4 at turn23? But then we are at row4 at turn23.\n\nCheck row4 at turn23: freeway4 has two cars? \n  At turn23 (T=23, T-17=6) for freeway4:\n    Car1: (6,-5,right,6): [-5+36=31, 6+36=42] -> safe.\n    Car2: (54,43,right,6): [43+36=79, 54+36=90] -> safe.\n\nSo row4 at turn23 is safe.\n\nBut then we are at row4 at turn23. We need to eventually go up. \n\nWe can try to go to row5 at turn24? \n\nCheck row5 at turn24 (T=24, T-17=7):\n  Freeway5:\n    Car1: (6,-5,right,6): [-5+42=37, 6+42=48] -> safe.\n    Car2: (42,31,right,6): [31+42=73, 42+42=84] -> safe.\n    Car3: (-36,-47,right,6): [-47+42=-5, -36+42=6] -> [-5,6] -> 0 is in this interval? Yes, because -5<=0<=6 -> collision.\n\nSo row5 at turn24 is also unsafe? \n\nThen when can we go to row5? \n\nWe must wait until the car3 on freeway5 has passed 0 and then moved beyond 0? \n\nThe car3 is moving right: at T=23: [-11,0] -> so at T=23, the car covers from -11 to 0, so 0 is the rightmost? Then at T=24: [-5,6] -> still covers 0? \nAt T=25: [-47+6*8=-47+48=1, -36+48=12] -> [1,12] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\nSo row5 is safe at turn25? \n\nBut we are at row4 at turn23. Then:\n  Turn23: at row4 -> we can do U at turn23: then at turn24 we are at row5? But at turn24, row5 is unsafe? \n\nAlternatively, we can wait at row4 for one turn (do S at turn23) so at turn24 we are still at row4. Then at turn24, we can check row5 at turn25: which is safe? \n\nSo:\n  Turn22: at row5 -> we do D to go to row4 (to avoid collision at row5 at turn23) -> then at turn23 we are at row4.\n  Turn23: at row4 -> do S (wait) -> at turn24 we are at row4.\n  Turn24: at row4 -> do U -> at turn25 we are at row5.\n\nThen at turn25, we are at row5. Check: \n  Freeway5 at turn25: T=25, T-17=8 -> \n    Car1: [-5+48=43, 6+48=54] -> safe.\n    Car2: [31+48=79,42+48=90] -> safe.\n    Car3: [-47+48=1, -36+48=12] -> [1,12] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\nThen we can proceed.\n\nBut note: we are behind schedule. We were at row5 at turn22 (if we had gone up without waiting we would have been at row5 at turn22). But then we did:\n  turn22: D -> to row4 at turn23\n  turn23: S -> stay at row4 at turn24\n  turn24: U -> to row5 at turn25\n\nSo we spent two extra turns to get to row5 at turn25.\n\nThen from row5 at turn25, we can go up:\n\n  Turn25: at row5 -> do U: then at turn26 we are at row6.\n\nCheck row6 at turn26 (T=26, T-17=9):\n  Freeway6: three cars:\n    Car1: (6,-5,right,6): at T=26: [-5+54=49, 6+54=60] -> safe.\n    Car2: (42,31,right,6): [31+54=85,42+54=96] -> safe.\n    Car3: (-36,-47,right,6): [-47+54=7, -36+54=18] -> [7,18] -> safe.\n\nThen turn26: at row6 -> do U: then at turn27 we are at row7.\n\nCheck row7 at turn27 (T=27, T-17=10):\n  Freeway7: same cars as freeway6? \n    Car1: [-5+60=55, 6+60=66] -> safe.\n    Car2: [31+60=91,42+60=102] -> safe.\n    Car3: [-47+60=13, -36+60=24] -> safe.\n\nThen turn27: at row7 -> do U: then at turn28 we are at row8.\n\nCheck row8 at turn28 (T=28, T-17=11):\n  Freeway8: same cars -> \n    Car1: [-5+66=61,6+66=72] -> safe.\n    Car2: [31+66=97,42+66=108] -> safe.\n    Car3: [-47+66=19,-36+66=30] -> safe.\n\nThen turn28: at row8 -> do U: then at turn29 we are at row9 -> goal.\n\nTotal turns: from turn17 to turn29: that's 13 turns? But we started at turn17 and we did actions at turns 17,18,...,28 (12 actions) and we are at row9 at turn29? \n\nWait, let's recount:\n\nAt turn17: we start at row0. We do U at turn17 -> turn18: row1\nturn18: U -> turn19: row2\nturn19: U -> turn20: row3\nturn20: U -> turn21: row4\nturn21: U -> turn22: row5\n\nAt turn22: we are at row5. Then we do D -> turn23: row4\nturn23: S -> turn24: row4\nturn24: U -> turn25: row5\nturn25: U -> turn26: row6\nturn26: U -> turn27: row7\nturn27: U -> turn28: row8\nturn28: U -> turn29: row9.\n\nSo we did 12 actions: from turn17 to turn28 (inclusive) -> 12 turns? But H is the number of turns, so H=12? \n\nBut note: the sequence of actions is for t from t1 to t1+H-1. And at the end of these H actions, we are at row9 at turn (t1 + H - 1). \n\nWe are at turn17 (t1) and we take actions at turns: 17,18,...,28 (12 turns). Then at turn28 we take the last action (U) and then at turn29 we are at row9. But the position at turn29 is row9, which is the goal. And the last action is at turn28, which is the 12th action? \n\nBut note: the problem says: a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} meaning t=0 to H-1: so the actions are taken at turns: t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1. Then at turn (t1+H) we are at the position after the last action. But we require that at turn (t1+H-1) we are at (0,9). \n\nWait: the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions ... to reach (0,9) at turn (t1+H-1)\".\n\nSo we must be at (0,9) at the same turn we take the last action? Or after the last action?\n\nLet me read: \n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn (t1+H-1)\"\n\nSo at turn (t1+H-1) we are at (0,9). \n\nBut note the update: \n  At turn t, we are at position (0, y_t). Then we choose a_t. Then we move to y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta(a_t). Then at the next turn (t+1) we are at (0, y_{t+1}).\n\nSo to be at row9 at turn (t1+H-1), that means that at the start of turn (t1+H-1) we are at row9? \n\nBut the problem says \"reach (0,9) at turn (t1+H-1)\". \n\nAnd the collision condition is checked at the turn we are on the freeway. \n\nActually, the state at the beginning of turn t is (0, y_t). Then we choose a_t, and then during the turn we move? But the collision condition says: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if ... for any car on freeway y_T\". So at turn T, we are on row y_T, and we check the cars at that same turn T.\n\nTherefore, we are at row y_t at the beginning of turn t and throughout turn t? \n\nSo if we are to be at row9 at turn (t1+H-1), then we must be at row9 at the beginning of turn (t1+H-1). How did we get there? \n\nWe must have been at row8 at turn (t1+H-2) and then done U? Then at turn (t1+H-1) we are at row9? \n\nBut note: \n  At turn (t1+H-2): we are at row8. We do U. Then at the next state (turn t1+H-1) we are at row9? \n\nBut the problem says: at turn (t1+H-1) we are at (0,9). \n\nSo that means that at the start of turn (t1+H-1) we are at row9. How did we get to row9? \n\nWe must have been at row8 at the start of turn (t1+H-2) and then done U at turn (t1+H-2) to become row9 at turn (t1+H-1). \n\nBut then the last action (the U) is taken at turn (t1+H-2). And the sequence of actions is from t1 to t1+H-1? \n\nWait: the sequence is {a_{t1+t} for t=0 to H-1. \n  t=0: a_{t1} -> at turn t1\n  t=1: a_{t1+1} -> at turn t1+1\n  ...\n  t=H-1: a_{t1+H-1} -> at turn t1+H-1.\n\nThen at the end of turn t1+H-1, we are at row y_{t1+H}? \n\nBut we require to be at row9 at turn (t1+H-1). \n\nThis seems inconsistent.\n\nLet me re-read the problem: \n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn (t1 + H - 1)\"\n\nAnd the update: \n  y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t.\n\nSo at the start of turn t, we are at y_t. Then we do a_t, and then we set y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta(a_t). Then the next turn is t+1, and we are at y_{t+1}.\n\nTherefore, at turn (t1+H-1) we are at y_{t1+H-1}. We require that y_{t1+H-1} = 9.\n\nSo we must have y_{t1+H-1} = 9.\n\nHow do we get y_{t1+H-1}=9? \n  It must be that at the previous turn (t1+H-2) we were at y_{t1+H-2} and we did an action that made y_{t1+H-1} = y_{t1+H-2} + Delta(a_{t1+H-2}) = 9.\n\nSo the last action (at turn t1+H-2) is what gets us to 9 at turn t1+H-1. \n\nBut the sequence of actions includes a_{t1+H-1}? Then we are doing an extra action at turn t1+H-1? \n\nWait: the sequence is for t from 0 to H-1: so the actions are at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1. \n\nThen the states: \n  Start: at turn t1: y_{t1} = 0.\n  After a_{t1}: at turn t1+1: y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + Delta(a_{t1})\n  ...\n  After a_{t1+H-1}: at turn t1+H: y_{t1+H} = y_{t1+H-1} + Delta(a_{t1+H-1})\n\nBut we require that at turn (t1+H-1) we are at 9. So we require y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nBut then we are also taking an action at turn t1+H-1? Then we move to y_{t1+H}. We don't care about that? \n\nBut the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn (t1+H-1)\". So we are at 9 at the start of turn t1+H-1? And then we do an action at that turn? Then we move to 10? But we cannot go above 9. \n\nActually, if we are at 9 and do U, we stay at 9. Similarly, D would go to 8? But we don't want to leave 9.\n\nBut the problem does not say that we must stay at 9, only that we are at 9 at turn (t1+H-1). So we can do any action at the last turn? \n\nBut note: the sequence of actions is for t=0 to H-1. So we must specify H actions? \n\nBut we require that at turn (t1+H-1) we are at 9. Then the last action (at turn t1+H-1) might change the row? \n\nHowever, the problem says: we are to reach (0,9) at turn (t1+H-1). So at that turn, we are at 9. Then we do an action? But the collision condition at that turn: we are at row9, which is not a freeway, so no collision. \n\nBut if we do an action that moves us from 9, then at the next turn we are not at 9? But we don't care. \n\nBut the problem does not require to stay at 9, only to be at 9 at turn (t1+H-1). \n\nSo in the plan I described, we are at row9 at turn29? But in that plan, the last action (at turn28) moved us from row8 to row9 at turn29. Then we are at row9 at turn29. \n\nBut the sequence of actions we took was from turn17 to turn28: that's 12 actions. Then H=12? \n\nThen the turn at which we are at row9 is turn29 = t1+H-1? -> 17+12-1 = 28? -> wait, 17+12-1=28, but we are at row9 at turn29? \n\nI see the confusion: \n\nWe are at the start of turn17: y17=0.\nWe do a17: then at the start of turn18: y18 = 0 + Delta(a17)\n\nSo after k actions, we are at the start of turn (17+k) at row y_{17+k}.\n\nWe require that at turn (17+H-1) we are at row9. That means that at the start of turn (17+H-1), y_{17+H-1}=9.\n\nHow many actions have been taken? The actions are taken at turns: 17, 18, ..., 17+H-2. So the last action is at turn (17+H-2) and that action leads to y_{17+H-1}=9.\n\nTherefore, the sequence of actions is for turns: 17, 18, ..., 17+H-2. The length of the sequence is H-1? \n\nBut the problem says: the sequence is {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}. So t from 0 to H-1: that's H actions. \n\nAnd we require that at turn (t1+H-1) we are at row9.\n\nSo: \n  After H actions (taken at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1), the state at turn (t1+H) is determined? But we require the state at turn (t1+H-1) to be 9.\n\nThis is inconsistent.\n\nLet me check the problem statement: \n\"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn (t1+H-1)\"\n\nAnd the update: \n  y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta(a_t)\n\nSo: \n  t = t1: y_{t1} is given (0). Then we do a_{t1} -> then we get y_{t1+1}.\n  t = t1+1: we do a_{t1+1} -> then we get y_{t1+2}.\n  ...\n  t = t1+H-1: we do a_{t1+H-1} -> then we get y_{t1+H}.\n\nWe require that at turn (t1+H-1) we are at (0,9). That is, y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nBut note: at turn (t1+H-1), we have not taken the action a_{t1+H-1} yet? Because the action at turn (t1+H-1) is taken during that turn, and then it updates the state to y_{t1+H}. \n\nBut the state y_{t1+H-1} is the state at the start of turn (t1+H-1). Then we take a_{t1+H-1} and then we are at y_{t1+H} at the next turn.\n\nSo to have y_{t1+H-1}=9, we must have achieved that by the actions taken at turns t1 to t1+H-2.\n\nTherefore, the action at turn t1+H-1 is taken when we are already at 9? \n\nBut the problem requires the sequence to include H actions, including one at turn t1+H-1. \n\nSo we must specify an action at turn t1+H-1, even though we are already at 9? \n\nAnd that action might change our row? But we are allowed to do S (stay) at 9: then y_{t1+H}=9.\n\nBut the requirement is only that at turn (t1+H-1) we are at 9. So we can do any action at that turn? \n\nHowever, the minimal H might be achieved without that extra action? \n\nBut the problem says we must output a sequence of H actions. \n\nSo if we want to be at 9 at turn t1+H-1, then we must have been at 9 at the start of that turn, and then we do an action (which might be S) to stay or move, but we are at 9 at the required turn.\n\nSo in the plan I described earlier, we were at row9 at turn29. But we require to be at row9 at turn (t1+H-1)=17+H-1.\n\nSo if we set 17+H-1 = 29, then H=13? \n\nThen the actions are from turn17 to turn17+12 (which is turn29)? \n\nBut then at turn29 we take an action? And we are at row9 at the start of turn29? \n\nBut then we do an action at turn29, which updates to row10? or to row9 (if we do S) at turn29. \n\nBut we are required to be at row9 at turn29 (the start of turn29). Then we do an action at turn29, which doesn't affect the state at turn29.\n\nSo in the plan I described, we reached row9 at turn29. So we require that turn29 = 17+H-1 -> H=13.\n\nBut the actions we took were from turn17 to turn28: that's 12 actions. But we need to output 13 actions? \n\nWe need to output one more action at turn29? \n\nBut at turn29 we are already at row9. We can do S (or U or D, but U and D would leave 9? but we can do S to stay).\n\nSo the minimal H might be 13? \n\nBut is there a shorter path? \n\nAlternatively, we might be able to avoid the collision without taking two extra turns.\n\nLet me try to see if we can do it in 10 turns? \n\nWe require: at turn (17+10-1)=26, we are at row9.\n\nThat means we must move from row0 to row9 in 10-1=9 moves? But we have to avoid cars.\n\nThe minimal moves is 9 upward moves. But we must wait at least 2 extra turns (because we had to wait two turns to avoid row5 at turn23 and row5 at turn24). \n\nIn the previous plan, we used 12 moves? Actually, we used 12 actions? But the upward moves: \n  We did: \n      turns17-21: 5 U's -> to row5 at turn22.\n      then turn22: D -> to row4 at turn23.\n      turn23: S -> stay at row4 at turn24.\n      turn24: U -> to row5 at turn25.\n      then turns25-28: 4 U's -> to row9 at turn29.\n\nTotal U: 5+1+4 = 10 U's? But we started at row0, and 10 U's would take us to row10? But we are constrained to 9. \n\nActually, we did:\n  turn17: U -> row1 at turn18\n  turn18: U -> row2 at turn19\n  turn19: U -> row3 at turn20\n  turn20: U -> row4 at turn21\n  turn21: U -> row5 at turn22\n  turn22: D -> row4 at turn23   (this is a down move)\n  turn23: S -> row4 at turn24   (stay)\n  turn24: U -> row5 at turn25\n  turn25: U -> row6 at turn26\n  turn26: U -> row7 at turn27\n  turn27: U -> row8 at turn28\n  turn28: U -> row9 at turn29\n\nSo we did 9 U's, 1 D, 1 S -> total 11 actions? But we did 12 actions? \n\nThe actions are at turns17 to 28: that's 12 actions.\n\nBut to be at row9 at turn29, we require H such that 17+H-1=29 -> H=13.\n\nAnd we have 12 actions so far? We need one more action at turn29? \n\nBut we are already at row9 at turn29. So we can do S at turn29. \n\nSo the sequence would be 13 actions: the 12 we did plus S at turn29.\n\nBut that would be H=13.\n\nBut is there a better way?\n\nAlternative: instead of going down to row4 at turn23, can we go up to row6 at a safer time?\n\nWe saw that row6 at turn23 is not safe because of car3 on freeway6: at turn23: span [-11,0] -> 0 is included.\n\nBut at turn24: car3 on freeway6: T=24, T-17=7: \n  left_end = -47+42 = -5, right_end=-36+42=6 -> [-5,6] -> 0 is included -> unsafe.\nAt turn25: T=25, T-17=8: -47+48=1, -36+48=12 -> [1,12] -> safe.\n\nSo the earliest we can be at row6 is turn25.\n\nBut how can we get to row6 at turn25? \n\nWe start at row0 at turn17.\n\nWe need to be at row6 at the start of turn25? \n\nThat means we have 8 moves (from turn17 to turn24) to get from row0 to row6: so we need 6 U's and 2 waits? \n\nFor example: \n  We go up as fast as possible but wait at some rows to avoid the car on row5 and row6.\n\nBut we also have to avoid the other freeways? \n\nWe know that freeways 1-4 are safe at the times we would normally pass (turns18,19,20,21). \n\nThe problem is freeway5 and freeway6.\n\nFreeway5: \n  We must avoid being on freeway5 when the car3 is covering 0. \n  The car3 covers 0 from when? \n      We require: 0 in [left_end, right_end] \n        left_end = -47 + s*(T-17) \n        right_end = -36 + s*(T-17)\n        => -47 + 6*(T-17) <= 0 <= -36 + 6*(T-17)\n        => 6*(T-17) <= 47 and 6*(T-17) >= 36\n        => 36 <= 6*(T-17) <= 47\n        => 6 <= (T-17) <= 7.83 -> so T-17 = 6 or 7.\n\n        So at T=23 (6) and T=24 (7): unsafe for freeway5.\n\n        Similarly, for freeway6: same car3? Actually, freeway6 has the same car3? \n        But freeway6 is a different row. The car3 is on freeway5? No, the cars are per freeway. \n\nWait: the car state is given per freeway. So the car3 on freeway5 is only on freeway5. Similarly, the car3 on freeway6 is a different car? \n\nBut in the input, for freeway5: \n  Cars: (6, -5, right, 6), (42,31,right,6), (-36,-47,right,6)\nfor freeway6: \n  Cars: (6, -5, right, 6), (42,31,right,6), (-36,-47,right,6)\n\nSo it's the same set of cars? But they are on different freeways. \n\nSo for freeway5, the car3 is at freeway5, and for freeway6, there is a separate car3 (with the same parameters) on freeway6.\n\nTherefore, we must avoid freeway5 at turns 23 and 24, and freeway6 at turns 23 and 24? \n\nBecause for freeway6 at turn23: \n  car3: left_end = -47+6*6 = -47+36=-11, right_end=-36+36=0 -> unsafe.\n  at turn24: -47+42=-5, -36+42=6 -> unsafe.\n\nAnd at turn25: freeway6: car3: -47+48=1, -36+48=12 -> safe.\n\nSimilarly for freeway5: unsafe at turns23,24 and safe at turn25.\n\nTherefore, we cannot be on freeway5 at turns23 and24, and we cannot be on freeway6 at turns23 and24.\n\nWe must schedule our passage of freeway5 and freeway6 at a safe time: turn25 or later.\n\nHow about this plan:\n\n  We want to be at row5 at turn25 and row6 at turn25? That's impossible. \n\nWe can only be at one row per turn.\n\nWe need to be at row5 at one turn and row6 at another.\n\nThe safe times for row5: any turn T except T=23 and T=24.\nSimilarly for row6: except T=23 and T=24.\n\nBut also, we have to worry about the other cars? But the other cars on freeway5 and freeway6 are far away (they have large positive coordinates) and moving right, so they will never cover 0? \n\nFor example, freeway5 car1: (6,-5,right,6): at turn17: [-5,6] -> but then moves right. At any T, the car1 is at [ -5+6*(T-17), 6+6*(T-17) ] -> which for T>=17, the left_end is at least -5, and it increases. So it will cover 0 only when -5+6*(T-17) <=0<=6+6*(T-17). \n  -5+6k<=0 => 6k<=5 => k<=0.83 -> k=0: at turn17: [-5,6] -> 0 is included? But at turn17, we are not on freeway5? We are at row0 at turn17. \n\nBut if we are on freeway5 at turn17, then we would collide. But we are not. \n\nBut for future turns: at k>=1: left_end = -5+6>=1>0 -> so never covers 0 again.\n\nSimilarly, car2: [31,42] at turn17, and then moves right -> always above 31 -> never covers 0.\n\nSo the only dangerous car on freeway5 and freeway6 is car3.\n\nSo we can be on freeway5 at any turn T except 23 and 24, and on freeway6 at any turn T except 23 and 24.\n\nNow, we want to minimize the total turns. We need to go from row0 to row9, passing rows1-8. We can spend extra turns waiting at safe rows.\n\nThe minimal number of upward moves is 9. The minimal H would be 9 if we could go straight up. But we have to avoid rows5 and6 at turns23 and24. \n\nWe are at row0 at turn17.\n\nWe can try to go faster to rows1-4, and then wait, or slower.\n\nWe need to schedule:\n  Let t5 be the turn we are on row5.\n  Let t6 be the turn we are on row6.\n\nWe require t5 !=23 and t5!=24, and t6!=23 and t6!=24.\n\nAlso, the difference between t5 and t6 must be at least 1? And we must have t5 < t6, since we go up.\n\nThe turns are consecutive integers.\n\nAlso, we start at row0 at turn17. We can only move one row per turn.\n\nSo the earliest we can be at row5 is turn22: \n  turn17: row0\n  turn18: row1\n  turn19: row2\n  turn20: row3\n  turn21: row4\n  turn22: row5 -> but turn22 is safe? \n      freeway5 at turn22: T=22, T-17=5: car3: left_end=-47+30=-17, right_end=-36+30=-6 -> safe.\n\nThen we can be at row5 at turn22. Then we want to be at row6 at turn25 (because turn23 and24 are unsafe for row6). \n\nSo we can wait at row5 for two turns: \n  turn22: at row5 (safe) -> do S\n  turn23: at row5 -> but at turn23, row5 is unsafe? \n        freeway5 at turn23: car3: [-11,0] -> unsafe.\n\nSo we cannot wait at row5 on turn23.\n\nWe could go up to row6 at turn23? But row6 at turn23 is unsafe.\n\nSo we must leave row5 by turn22? But we just arrived at turn22. \n\nAt turn22, we are at row5. Then at turn22 we can do:\n  Option1: U -> then at turn23 we are at row6 -> unsafe.\n  Option2: D -> then at turn23 we are at row4.\n  Option3: S -> then at turn23 we are at row5 -> unsafe.\n\nSo the only safe option is D: to row4 at turn23.\n\nThen at turn23: at row4 -> safe (because freeway4 has no car covering 0 at turn23: as computed earlier).\nThen we can wait at row4 for two turns? \n  turn23: at row4 -> do S\n  turn24: at row4 -> do S? \n        freeway4 at turn24: T=24, T-17=7: \n            car1: -5+42=37, 6+42=48 -> safe.\n            car2: 43+42=85, 54+42=96 -> safe.\n        so safe.\n  turn25: at row4 -> do U: then at turn26 we are at row5? \n\nBut we want to be at row6 at turn25? \n\nAlternatively, from row4 at turn23, we could do U at turn23 to go to row5 at turn24? But at turn24, row5 is unsafe.\n\nSo we must wait at row4 until turn25? Then at turn25 we do U: to row5 at turn26.\n\nThen at turn26: at row5 -> safe? \n  freeway5 at turn26: T=26, T-17=9: car3: -47+54=7, -36+54=18 -> safe.\n\nThen we can proceed.\n\nBut then we are at row5 at turn26. Then we go up:\n  turn26: U -> turn27: row6\n        freeway6 at turn27: T=27, T-17=10: car3: -47+60=13, -36+60=24 -> safe.\n  turn27: U -> turn28: row7\n  turn28: U -> turn29: row8\n  turn29: U -> turn30: row9\n\nThen at turn30, we are at row9. \n\nBut we require to be at row9 at turn (17+H-1). So turn30 = 17+H-1 -> H=14.\n\nThis is worse than our previous plan (which was H=13).\n\nIn our previous plan, we were at row5 at turn22, then down to row4 at turn23, then wait at turn23 (row4) and then at turn24 go up to row5 at turn25, then to row6 at turn26, etc., reaching row9 at turn29.\n\nThat gave us: \n  turn29: row9 -> so 17+H-1=29 -> H=13.\n\nAnd we did 12 actions to get to row9 at turn29, and then we need one more action at turn29? But we are already at row9 at the start of turn29, so we can do S at turn29.\n\nSo the sequence is 13 actions.\n\nBut can we do better? \n\nWe could try to be at row5 earlier? \n\nThe earliest we can be at row5 is turn22. But then we have to leave row5 immediately because we cannot be there at turn23. \n\nFrom row5 at turn22, we can go down to row4 at turn23. Then from row4, we can go up to row5 at turn24? But row5 at turn24 is unsafe. \n\nOr we can go up to row5 at turn25: \n  turn22: row5 -> D to row4 at turn23.\n  turn23: row4 -> S to row4 at turn24.\n  turn24: row4 -> U to row5 at turn25.\n\nThat's what we did.\n\nAlternatively, from row5 at turn22, could we go up to row6 at a safe time? But we cannot go to row6 at turn23 (unsafe) or turn24 (unsafe). \n\nSo the earliest we can go to row6 is turn25. But to be at row6 at turn25, we must be at row5 at turn24? But row5 at turn24 is unsafe. \n\nSo we cannot go directly from row5 to row6 without waiting? \n\nTherefore, the plan we have is minimal.\n\nBut we can try to adjust the waiting: maybe wait at a lower row to avoid having to go down.\n\nFor example, wait at row4 before going to row5. \n\nWe can arrive at row4 earlier? \n\nThe earliest at row4 is turn21: \n  turn17: U -> row1 at turn18\n  turn18: U -> row2 at turn19\n  turn19: U -> row3 at turn20\n  turn20: U -> row4 at turn21\n\nThen at turn21: we are at row4. \n\nThen we can wait at row4 for 3 turns: \n  turn21: S -> row4 at turn22\n  turn22: S -> row4 at turn23\n  turn23: S -> row4 at turn24\n  turn24: U -> row5 at turn25\n\nThen proceed:\n  turn25: U -> row6 at turn26\n  turn26: U -> row7 at turn27\n  turn27: U -> row8 at turn28\n  turn28: U -> row9 at turn29\n\nTotal: \n  Actions: \n    turn17: U\n    turn18: U\n    turn19: U\n    turn20: U\n    turn21: S\n    turn22: S\n    turn23: S\n    turn24: U\n    turn25: U\n    turn26: U\n    turn27: U\n    turn28: U\n    and then at turn29: we are at row9 -> so we need to do an action at turn29? \n        We can do S.\n\nBut we have only done 12 actions (turns17 to 28) and we are at row9 at turn29. So we need a 13th action at turn29: S.\n\nTotal actions: 13.\n\nThis is the same as before.\n\nBut in this plan, we did not use a down move. We only used U and S.\n\nThe path: \n  turn17: U (to row1 at turn18)\n  turn18: U (to row2 at turn19)\n  turn19: U (to row3 at turn20)\n  turn20: U (to row4 at turn21)\n  turn21: S (stay at row4 at turn22)\n  turn22: S (stay at row4 at turn23)\n  turn23: S (stay at row4 at turn24)\n  turn24: U (to row5 at turn25) -> safe\n  turn25: U (to row6 at turn26) -> safe (freeway6 at turn26: car3 at [7,18] -> safe)\n  turn26: U (to row7 at turn27) -> safe\n  turn27: U (to row8 at turn28) -> safe\n  turn28: U (to row9 at turn29) \n  turn29: S (we are at row9 at turn29, and we do S to stay at row9 at turn30)\n\nBut the requirement is to be at row9 at turn (17+H-1). We are at row9 at turn29. So 17+H-1=29 -> H=13.\n\nThe actions from turn17 to turn29 (13 actions) are:\n\n  turn17: U\n  turn18: U\n  turn19: U\n  turn20: U\n  turn21: S\n  turn22: S\n  turn23: S\n  turn24: U\n  turn25: U\n  turn26: U\n  turn27: U\n  turn28: U\n  turn29: S\n\nBut note: at turn28: we do U, and then at turn29 we are at row9. Then at turn29 we do S.\n\nThis meets the requirement: at turn29 (which is 17+13-1=29) we are at row9.\n\nBut is it safe? \n\nWe need to check each turn where we are on a freeway (rows1-8) and verify that at that turn, no car on that freeway covers 0.\n\nWe are on:\n  row1 at turn18: safe (as before)\n  row2 at turn19: safe\n  row3 at turn20: safe\n  row4 at turn21: freeway4 at turn21: T=21, T-17=4: \n        car1: -5+24=19, 6+24=30 -> safe.\n        car2: 43+24=67, 54+24=78 -> safe.\n  row4 at turn22: T=22, T-17=5: \n        car1: -5+30=25, 6+30=36 -> safe.\n        car2: 43+30=73,54+30=84 -> safe.\n  row4 at turn23: T=23, T-17=6: \n        car1: -5+36=31,6+36=42 -> safe.\n        car2: 43+36=79,54+36=90 -> safe.\n  row4 at turn24: T=24, T-17=7: \n        car1: -5+42=37,6+42=48 -> safe.\n        car2: 43+42=85,54+42=96 -> safe.\n  row5 at turn25: T=25, T-17=8: \n        freeway5: \n            car1: -5+48=43,6+48=54 -> safe.\n            car2: 31+48=79,42+48=90 -> safe.\n            car3: -47+48=1,-36+48=12 -> [1,12] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n  row6 at turn26: T=26, T-17=9: \n        freeway6: \n            car1: -5+54=49,6+54=60 -> safe.\n            car2: 31+54=85,42+54=96 -> safe.\n            car3: -47+54=7,-36+54=18 -> safe.\n  row7 at turn27: similarly safe.\n  row8 at turn28: safe.\n\nSo it's safe.\n\nBut is this minimal? We used 13 turns. \n\nThe minimal without any waiting is 9, but we had to wait 3 turns (at row4: turns21,22,23). So total 9+3=12 moves? But we have 13 actions? \n\nThe upward moves: 9 (from row0 to row9). The waits: 3. And one extra action at the end (S at turn29). So 9+3+1=13.\n\nBut note: the last action (at turn29) is after we have already reached row9 at the start of turn29. So we could consider that we reached at turn29 with 12 actions? But the problem requires a sequence of H actions and to be at row9 at turn (17+H-1). \n\nIf we only did 12 actions, then we would be at row9 at turn29 (which is 17+12-1=28? -> 17+12-1=28, but turn29 is 28? no, turn29 is 29).\n\nWe are at row9 at turn29. To have 17+H-1=29, we need H=13.\n\nSo we must output 13 actions.\n\nBut is there a way with H=12? \n\nWe require 17+H-1 = 17+12-1 = 28. So we must be at row9 at turn28.\n\nHow to be at row9 at turn28? \n  That means we were at row8 at turn27, and did U at turn27 to be at row9 at turn28.\n\nWe need to be at row8 at turn27.\n\nWe can try:\n\n  We need to go from row0 to row8 in 10 actions? (because turn17 to turn27 is 11 states? let me see)\n\n  At turn17: row0.\n  After 1 action (turn17): at turn18: row1\n  After 2: turn19: row2\n  ...\n  After 8: turn25: row8? \n\n  Then at turn25: at row8 -> then do U at turn25: then at turn26: row9 -> but we need to be at row9 at turn28? \n\n  Alternatively, we want to be at row8 at turn27: \n        turn27: row8 -> then do U at turn27: then at turn28: row9.\n\n  So we need to be at row8 at turn27.\n\n  How many moves from row0 to row8? 8 U's. We have 10 actions (from turn17 to turn26) to get to row8 at turn27? \n\n  We start at turn17: row0.\n  We take actions at turn17,18,...,26 (10 actions) to be at row8 at turn27.\n\n  We can do 8 U's and 2 S's.\n\n  The earliest we can be at row8 is turn25 (8 moves: turn17 to turn24: 8 U's -> at turn25: row8). \n\n  But we need to be at row8 at turn27. So we can wait at row8 for two turns? \n\n  But we have to avoid the cars on freeway8? \n\n  Freeway8 at turn27: T=27, T-17=10: \n        car1: (6,-5,right,6): [-5+60=55,6+60=66] -> safe.\n        car2: (42,31,right,6): [31+60=91,42+60=102] -> safe.\n        car3: (-36,-47,right,6): [-47+60=13,-36+60=24] -> safe.\n\n  So row8 at turn27 is safe.\n\n  But we also have to pass the lower freeways safely.\n\n  We must avoid row5 and row6 at turns23 and24.\n\n  We can plan:\n\n      turn17: U -> row1 at turn18 (safe)\n      turn18: U -> row2 at turn19 (safe)\n      turn19: U -> row3 at turn20 (safe)\n      turn20: U -> row4 at turn21 (safe)\n      turn21: U -> row5 at turn22 (safe: freeway5 at turn22: T=22, T-17=5: car3: [-17,-6] -> safe)\n      turn22: what to do? \n          We cannot be at row5 at turn23 -> so we must leave.\n          Option: U -> then at turn23: row6 -> unsafe.\n          Option: D -> then at turn23: row4.\n          Option: S -> then at turn23: row5 -> unsafe.\n\n      So we must do D: to row4 at turn23.\n\n      Then at turn23: at row4 -> safe.\n      Then we have to get to row8 by turn27.\n\n      From row4 at turn23, we need 4 U's to get to row8, but we have 4 actions: turn23,24,25,26.\n\n      So:\n          turn23: at row4 -> do U: to row5 at turn24 -> but row5 at turn24 is unsafe.\n          turn23: do S: then at turn24: row4.\n          turn24: do U: to row5 at turn25 -> safe (as before).\n          turn25: do U: to row6 at turn26 -> safe (freeway6 at turn26: T=26, T-17=9: car3: [7,18] -> safe)\n          turn26: do U: to row7 at turn27\n          turn27: we are at row7, not row8.\n\n      We need to be at row8 at turn27. \n\n      Alternatively, from row4 at turn23, we do U at turn23: unsafe for row5 at turn24? No, we are doing U at turn23: then at turn24 we are at row5 -> unsafe.\n\n      Or we do two U's quickly:\n\n          turn23: at row4 -> do U: to row5 at turn24 -> unsafe.\n\n      How about going to row6 at turn25? \n          We can go from row4 to row6 in two moves? \n          turn23: U -> row5 at turn24 (unsafe) -> not allowed.\n          turn23: do nothing? then turn24: row4 -> then turn24: U to row5 at turn25 (safe) -> then turn25: U to row6 at turn26 (safe) -> then turn26: U to row7 at turn27 -> then we are at row7 at turn27, not row8.\n\n      We need to be at row8 at turn27. We are at row7 at turn27. So we are one short.\n\n      If we try to use fewer waits: \n\n          turn17: U\n          turn18: U\n          turn19: U\n          turn20: U\n          turn21: U -> row5 at turn22 (safe)\n          turn22: D -> row4 at turn23 (safe)\n          turn23: U -> to row5 at turn24 -> unsafe.\n\n      We cannot do that.\n\n      Or at turn22: do S? -> unsafe at turn23.\n\n      So we are forced to spend at least one extra turn at row4? \n\n      We did:\n\n          turn22: D to row4 at turn23\n          turn23: S to row4 at turn24\n          turn24: U to row5 at turn25\n          turn25: U to row6 at turn26\n          turn26: U to row7 at turn27\n          turn27: U to row8 at turn28\n\n      Then we are at row8 at turn28. Then we do U at turn28: to row9 at turn29.\n\n      To be at row9 at turn28? We would need to be at row8 at turn27 and do U at turn27 to be at row9 at turn28.\n\n      But we are at row8 at turn28, so we are late.\n\nTherefore, we cannot reach row9 at turn28.\n\nHence, the minimal H is 13.\n\nSo we choose the plan that uses 13 actions.\n\nWe have two plans:\n\nPlan A (with a down move):\n  Actions:\n    turn17: U\n    turn18: U\n    turn19: U\n    turn20: U\n    turn21: U\n    turn22: D\n    turn23: S\n    turn24: U\n    turn25: U\n    turn26: U\n    turn27: U\n    turn28: U\n    turn29: S\n\nBut in this plan, at turn29 we do S. We are at row9 at turn29? \n  At turn28: we were at row8. We did U at turn28: so at turn29 we are at row9.\n\n  Then at turn29 we do S: so at turn30 we are at row9.\n\n  And we are at row9 at turn29 (the start of turn29) and also at turn30? \n\n  But the requirement is at turn29 (17+13-1=29) we are at row9 -> satisfied.\n\nPlan B (without down move, only up and stay):\n  turn17: U\n  turn18: U\n  turn19: U\n  turn20: U\n  turn21: S\n  turn22: S\n  turn23: S\n  turn24: U\n  turn25: U\n  turn26: U\n  turn27: U\n  turn28: U\n  turn29: S\n\nIn this plan, we are at row4 from turn21 to turn24 (inclusive). Then at turn24 we do U: so at turn25 we are at row5. Then we do U at turn25: to row6 at turn26, etc., to row9 at turn29.\n\nBoth plans are safe and use 13 turns.\n\nBut note: in both plans, the action at turn29 is S, which is not harmful.\n\nWe can output either.\n\nBut the problem asks for minimal H, and both have H=13.\n\nWe can choose the one without down moves? It might be simpler.\n\nBut both are valid.\n\nLet me output Plan B.\n\nThe actions:\n\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\nTurn 19: U\nTurn 20: U\nTurn 21: S\nTurn 22: S\nTurn 23: S\nTurn 24: U\nTurn 25: U\nTurn 26: U\nTurn 27: U\nTurn 28: U\nTurn 29: S\n\nBut wait: the last action is at turn29, and we are at row9 at the start of turn29. Then we do S at turn29 -> then at turn30 we are still at row9. But we only care about being at row9 at turn29.\n\nSo it's fine.\n\nBut note: the sequence should be for t=0 to H-1=12, so 13 actions.\n\nNow, write the answer:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\nTurn 19: U\nTurn 20: U\nTurn 21: S\nTurn 22: S\nTurn 23: S\nTurn 24: U\nTurn 25: U\nTurn 26: U\nTurn 27: U\nTurn 28: U\nTurn 29: S\n}\n\nBut the current turn is t1=17, and the sequence starts at t1 and goes to t1+12=29.\n\nThis is the answer.\n</think>\nTo reach the position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 0) at turn 17 while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 13. The sequence of actions must ensure that the player is at row 9 at turn \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 17 + 13 - 1 = 29\\).\n\nThe car states at turn 17 are given, and all cars are right-moving with speed 6. The dangerous periods for freeways 5 and 6 are turns 23 and 24, as the car with parameters \\((-36, -47, \\text{right}, 6)\\) covers position 0 at these times. Specifically:\n- For freeway 5 at turn 23: span \\([-11, 0]\\) (collision if present).\n- For freeway 5 at turn 24: span \\([-5, 6]\\) (collision if present).\n- For freeway 6 at turn 23: span \\([-11, 0]\\) (collision if present).\n- For freeway 6 at turn 24: span \\([-5, 6]\\) (collision if present).\n\nThe player must avoid being on freeway 5 or 6 at turns 23 and 24. The safe plan involves moving up to row 4 by turn 21, waiting at row 4 for three turns (turns 21, 22, 23) to avoid the dangerous periods, then proceeding upward safely.\n\nThe sequence of actions is as follows:\n- **Turn 17 (action U)**: Move to row 1 at turn 18 (safe, as freeway 1 at turn 18 has no car covering 0).\n- **Turn 18 (action U)**: Move to row 2 at turn 19 (safe, freeway 2 at turn 19 safe).\n- **Turn 19 (action U)**: Move to row 3 at turn 20 (safe, freeway 3 at turn 20 safe).\n- **Turn 20 (action U)**: Move to row 4 at turn 21 (safe, freeway 4 at turn 21 safe).\n- **Turn 21 (action S)**: Stay at row 4 at turn 22 (safe, freeway 4 at turn 22 safe).\n- **Turn 22 (action S)**: Stay at row 4 at turn 23 (safe, freeway 4 at turn 23 safe).\n- **Turn 23 (action S)**: Stay at row 4 at turn 24 (safe, freeway 4 at turn 24 safe).\n- **Turn 24 (action U)**: Move to row 5 at turn 25 (safe, freeway 5 at turn 25: car spans do not cover 0).\n- **Turn 25 (action U)**: Move to row 6 at turn 26 (safe, freeway 6 at turn 26: car spans do not cover 0).\n- **Turn 26 (action U)**: Move to row 7 at turn 27 (safe, freeway 7 at turn 27 safe).\n- **Turn 27 (action U)**: Move to row 8 at turn 28 (safe, freeway 8 at turn 28 safe).\n- **Turn 28 (action U)**: Move to row 9 at turn 29 (goal reached, as row 9 is not a freeway).\n- **Turn 29 (action S)**: Stay at row 9 (required as part of the sequence; no collision possible).\n\nThis sequence ensures the player is at (0, 9) at turn 29 (i.e., \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 17 + 13 - 1 = 29\\)) and avoids all collisions.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 17: U \\\\\nTurn 18: U \\\\\nTurn 19: U \\\\\nTurn 20: U \\\\\nTurn 21: S \\\\\nTurn 22: S \\\\\nTurn 23: S \\\\\nTurn 24: U \\\\\nTurn 25: U \\\\\nTurn 26: U \\\\\nTurn 27: U \\\\\nTurn 28: U \\\\\nTurn 29: S\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,1) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t₁ = 18.\n\nFirst, I should understand how the cars move. All cars are moving to the right with speed 6, meaning they move 6 units to the right every turn.\n\nThe collision rule says that a collision occurs at turn T only if the player is on a freeway y at that turn, and for some car on that freeway, 0 is in its span at turn T. The player is at x=0 always, so we care about whether x=0 is covered by a car on the freeway the player is on at that turn.\n\nAlso, when the player moves to a new y, they are not on that new y until the next turn. So if at turn T, the player is on y_T, and they move to y_{T+1}, they are only on y_T at turn T, and on y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nThe player position is given as (0, y_t), so at turn t, they are at (0, y_t).\n\nThe update is: at turn t, they choose action a_t, which changes y for turn t+1.\n\nLet me read carefully.\n\n\"y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\" based on a_t.\n\nAnd collision at turn T if 0 ∈ Span(T) for a car on freeway y_T.\n\ny_T is the position at turn T.\n\nAlso, the note: if you move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you are not on y_{T+1} at turn T, so you only check for collision on y_T at turn T.\n\nIn this case, since you are at (0, y_T) at turn T, and you move to y_{T+1} at turn T, which takes effect at t+1.\n\nSo at turn T, you are on freeway y_T, so you need to avoid collision with cars on y_T at turn T.\n\nThen at turn T+1, you are on y_{T+1}, so you need to avoid collision there, and so on.\n\nNow, the cars: all freeways have cars moving right at speed 6.\n\nLet me list the cars for each freeway.\n\nFreeway 1: (12,1,right,6) and (60,49,right,6)\n\nI think head and tail: for right-moving, head is the front, so for the first car, head at 12, tail at 1? That seems odd because usually tail is behind.\n\nIn the car update, for right-moving: span at t is [τ, h], and at T, [τ + s(T-t), h + s(T-t)]\n\nIn the initial state, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed)\n\nFor right-moving, head should be greater than tail if it's moving right.\n\nIn freeway 1: (12,1,right,6), so head=12, tail=1, so span at t₁=18 is [1,12]? But the notation says for right-moving, span is [τ, h], so [1,12].\n\nSimilarly, (60,49,right,6), span [49,60].\n\nBut [49,60] is to the right, so at x=0, it might not be covered now.\n\nSimilarly for other freeways.\n\nFreeway 2,3,4 same as 1.\n\nFreeway 5,6,7,8: (12,1,right,6), (48,37,right,6), (-30,-41,right,6)\n\n(-30,-41) with direction right? -41 and -30, head=-30, tail=-41, so since right-moving, span [τ, h] = [-41, -30], which is left of zero.\n\nNow, all cars move right at 6 per turn.\n\nPlayer starts at turn t₁=18, position y=1.\n\nI need to get to y=9.\n\ny=9 is the goal, but freeways are y=1 to y=8, so y=9 might be safe, no cars, I assume.\n\nThe grid is y=0 to 9, freeways y=1 to 8 have cars, y=0 and y=9 might be safe.\n\ny=0 is the starting point sometimes, but here player is at (0,1) at turn 18.\n\ny=0 might be safe, but we need to reach (0,9).\n\nNow, to minimize H, the number of turns, so I should go up as fast as possible, but avoiding collisions.\n\nThe minimal vertical distance is from y=1 to y=9, which is 8 units, so if I go up every turn, it would take 8 turns: from y=1 to 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9.\n\nBut I might have to wait or go down if there's a car at x=0 when I'm on a freeway.\n\nSince I can stay or go down, but going down might not help if I'm going to y=9, so probably staying or going down only to avoid, but since time is minimal, I should only do that if necessary.\n\nBut going down from y=1 is not possible, since y=0 is bottom, and y_{t+1} must be in [0,9], so from y=1, I can go up to 2, down to 0, or stay at 1.\n\nSimilarly, at y=0, I can only go up to 1 or stay, I think, but since we need to reach y=9, staying or going down might delay.\n\nBut to avoid collision, I might need to.\n\nFirst, I need to find when cars are at x=0 on each freeway.\n\nSince cars move right, x=0 might be covered when the car span includes 0.\n\nFor each freeway, I need to find for which turns the car spans include 0.\n\nBut multiple cars per freeway, so I need to check for each car when it covers x=0.\n\nCollision if any car on that freeway has 0 in span at that turn.\n\nNow, let's define the time from current turn.\n\nSet τ = T - t₁, so at τ=0, current turn, t= t₁.\n\nFor a given freeway, at time τ after t₁, the position of a car.\n\nFor a car with initial head h, tail τ, direction right, speed s=6.\n\nAt turn T = t₁ + τ, the span is [τ + 6τ, h + 6τ]? Let's see.\n\nFrom the update: at turn T > t₁, span for right-moving car: [τ + s(T - t₁), h + s(T - t₁)]\n\ns=6, T - t₁ = τ.\n\nSo span at time τ: [tail + 6τ, head + 6τ] for right-moving.\n\n0 is in span if tail + 6τ ≤ 0 ≤ head + 6τ\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but here all are right-moving.\n\nIn this case, all cars are right-moving.\n\nSo for a car, 0 is covered when min(tail + 6τ, head + 6τ) ≤ 0 ≤ max, but since right-moving and tail < head, tail + 6τ ≤ head + 6τ, so 0 in [tail + 6τ, head + 6τ] if tail + 6τ ≤ 0 ≤ head + 6τ.\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need to find τ where for some car, this holds.\n\nBut since multiple cars, I need the union over cars.\n\nNow, let's list for each freeway the cars.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: cars (12,1,right,6) and (60,49,right,6)\n\nFor first car: tail=1, head=12\n\n0 in span if 1 + 6τ ≤ 0 ≤ 12 + 6τ\n\n1 + 6τ ≤ 0? 6τ ≤ -1, τ ≤ -1/6, but τ ≥ 0, so 1 + 6τ >0, so 0 ≤ 12 + 6τ is always true since τ≥0, but 1 + 6τ ≤ 0 is false, so 0 not in [1+6τ, 12+6τ] for τ≥0.\n\nSimilarly, second car: tail=49, head=60, 49 + 6τ ≤ 0 ≤ 60 + 6τ? 49+6τ >0, so 0 ≤ 60+6τ true, but 49+6τ ≤0 false, so never.\n\nSo for freeway 1, no car ever covers x=0 for τ≥0? Is that right?\n\n1 + 6τ ≥1 >0, so lower bound >0, so 0 not in span. Similarly for second car, 49+6τ >0.\n\nBut what about when τ negative? But we start from τ=0, so for future turns, x=0 not covered on freeway 1.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2,3,4 same cars, so same thing, no car covers x=0 for τ≥0.\n\nNow freeway 5: cars (12,1,right,6), (48,37,right,6), (-30,-41,right,6)\n\nFirst car: same as above, tail=1, head=12, 1+6τ >0, so 0 not in [1+6τ,12+6τ]\n\nSecond car: tail=37, head=48, 37+6τ >0, so 0 not in [37+6τ,48+6τ]\n\nThird car: head=-30, tail=-41, right-moving, so span at τ: [tail + 6τ, head + 6τ] = [-41 + 6τ, -30 + 6τ]\n\n0 in span if -41 + 6τ ≤ 0 ≤ -30 + 6τ\n\nSo -41 + 6τ ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ -30 + 6τ\n\nFirst inequality: -41 + 6τ ≤ 0 => 6τ ≤ 41 => τ ≤ 41/6 ≈ 6.833\n\nSecond inequality: 0 ≤ -30 + 6τ => 6τ ≥ 30 => τ ≥ 5\n\nSo for τ from 5 to 6.833, since τ integer, τ=5,6\n\nAt τ=5: -41 + 30 = -11 ≤ 0, -30 + 30 =0 ≤0? 0 ≤ 0 is true, so yes.\n\nAt τ=6: -41 + 36 = -5 ≤ 0, -30 + 36 =6 ≥0, so 0 ≤6 true, so yes.\n\nAt τ=7: -41+42=1 >0, so lower bound >0, 0 not in span.\n\nSimilarly, τ=4: -41+24= -17 ≤0, but -30+24= -6 <0, so 0 not ≤ -6? 0 ≤ -6 false, so not in span.\n\nSo for freeway 5, third car covers x=0 at τ=5 and τ=6.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6,7,8 have the same cars: (12,1,right,6), (48,37,right,6), (-30,-41,right,6), so same as freeway 5, so x=0 covered at τ=5 and τ=6.\n\nNow freeways 1-4 have no coverage at x=0 for τ≥0.\n\nFreeways 5-8 have coverage at τ=5 and τ=6.\n\nτ is time from now, so at turn t₁ + τ.\n\nt₁=18, so at turn 18 + 5 = 23 and turn 18 + 6 = 24.\n\nBut this is for freeways y=5 to y=8? Freeways k=5,6,7,8.\n\nk is the freeway number, which corresponds to y=k, I assume.\n\nIn the table, freeway k, and y=k.\n\nSo for freeway y=5,6,7,8, at turn 23 and 24, x=0 is covered by a car, so if the player is on that freeway at turn 23 or 24, collision occurs.\n\nFor freeways y=1,2,3,4, no car ever at x=0 for future turns, so safe at all times.\n\nPlayer starts at y=1 at turn t=18.\n\ny=1 is freeway 1, which is safe, no cars at x=0 ever.\n\nI need to get to y=9.\n\nThe freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=9 has no cars, so when I reach y=9, no collision.\n\nTo go from y=1 to y=9, I need to pass through y=2,3,4,5,6,7,8.\n\nSince y=1,2,3,4 are always safe, I can move up quickly through them.\n\nBut y=5,6,7,8 are dangerous at t=23 and t=24.\n\nt=23 and t=24 are specific turns.\n\nNow, the player position over time.\n\nLet me denote the turn sequence.\n\nSet t = t₁ + τ, with τ starting from 0.\n\nAt τ=0, turn t=18, y=1.\n\nI need to choose actions for each turn, starting from a_{t₁} for turn t₁, which affects y at t₁+1.\n\nAt turn t, I choose a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nSo at turn t=18, I choose a_{18}, which sets y_{19} = y_{18} + Δy, based on a_{18}.\n\nThen at turn t=19, I choose a_{19}, sets y_{20}, and so on.\n\ny_{t} is position at turn t.\n\nAt turn t, position (0, y_t), and I am on freeway y_t at that turn.\n\nCollision if at that turn, for freeway y_t, x=0 is covered.\n\nI need to reach y_t =9 for some t.\n\nSince I start at y=1, and need to get to y=9, the minimal steps are 8 up moves.\n\nBut I might need to avoid being on y=5,6,7,8 at t=23 or t=24.\n\nt=23 is τ=5, t=24 is τ=6.\n\nτ = t - t₁ = t - 18.\n\nSo at t=23, τ=5; t=24, τ=6.\n\nNow, the dangerous turns for y=5,6,7,8 are t=23 and t=24.\n\nFor other times, y=5,6,7,8 might be safe.\n\nSince for freeways 5-8, only at τ=5 and 6, x=0 covered, so for other τ, no coverage, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=1,2,3,4 always safe.\n\ny=0 and y=9 no cars, so safe.\n\nNow, I need to be at y=9 at some turn.\n\nSince I start at y=1 at t=18, I can go up each turn to reach y=9 at t=18+8=26, for example.\n\nBut let's see the path.\n\nAt t=18, y=1.\n\nI choose a_{18}, which sets y_{19}.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSuppose I go up every turn.\n\nThen at turn t, y_t = 1 + (t - 18) for t from 18 to ...\n\nAt t=18, y=1\n\nAfter action a_{18}=U, y_{19} = 1 +1 =2\n\nSimilarly, a_{19}=U, y_{20}=3\n\na_{20}=U, y_{21}=4\n\na_{21}=U, y_{22}=5\n\na_{22}=U, y_{23}=6\n\na_{23}=U, y_{24}=7\n\na_{24}=U, y_{25}=8\n\na_{25}=U, y_{26}=9\n\nNow, at which turns is the player on which y.\n\nAt turn t=18, y=1, freeway 1, safe.\n\nt=19, y=2, freeway 2, safe.\n\nt=20, y=3, freeway 3, safe.\n\nt=21, y=4, freeway 4, safe.\n\nt=22, y=5, freeway 5.\n\nNow, at t=22, is there collision? t=22, τ=22-18=4.\n\nFor freeway 5, at τ=4, is x=0 covered?\n\nEarlier for freeway 5, coverage at τ=5 and 6.\n\nτ=4 not covered, so safe.\n\nt=23, y=6, freeway 6.\n\nt=23, τ=5.\n\nFor freeway 6, at τ=5, covered? Freeway 6 has cars, and at τ=5, covered, so yes, collision if on y=6 at t=23.\n\nSimilarly, t=24, y=7, freeway 7, at τ=6, covered, collision.\n\nIn this path, at t=23, y=6, which is dangerous, and collision occurs.\n\nSimilarly at t=24, y=7, collision.\n\nSo not good.\n\nI need to avoid being on y=5,6,7,8 at t=23 or t=24.\n\nSince y=5,6,7,8 are all dangerous at those times.\n\nNow, at other times, they are safe.\n\nFor example, before t=23 or after t=24.\n\nt=22 is τ=4, safe for y=5.\n\nt=25 is τ=7, for freeway 5-8, τ=7>6.833, not covered, safe.\n\nSimilarly, t=24 τ=6 covered, t=25 τ=7 not covered.\n\nτ=7: for the car, -41 + 6*7 = -41+42=1 >0, so not covered.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo y=5,6,7,8 are safe except at t=23 and t=24.\n\nTo avoid collision, I should not be on y=5,6,7,8 at t=23 or t=24.\n\nI can be on other y at those times.\n\ny=0,1,2,3,4,9 are safe at all times, including t=23,24.\n\ny=9 has no cars, so safe.\n\nNow, I need to reach y=9.\n\nThe minimal number of turns might be more than 8 if I have to wait.\n\nBut I can stay or go down to avoid being on dangerous rows at dangerous times.\n\nFor example, at t=23 and t=24, I should be on y=0,1,2,3,4 or 9.\n\nBut y=9 is the goal, so if I can reach earlier, better.\n\nSince from y=1 to y=9, 8 steps up, but I need to delay or advance so that when I pass y=5-8, it's not at t=23 or 24.\n\nThe dangerous times are only t=23 and 24 for those rows.\n\nSo I can pass y=5-8 before t=23 or after t=24.\n\nBefore t=23, for example at t=22, y=5 is safe, as in the earlier path.\n\nIn the path, at t=22, y=5, safe.\n\nThen if I could go directly to y=6 at t=23, but t=23 y=6 is dangerous.\n\nI need to skip t=23 for y=6, etc.\n\nSince I move one step at a time, I have to be on each y at some point if I go through.\n\nBut I can stay on a row or go down.\n\nFor example, I can stay on y=4 for an extra turn or something.\n\nLet me think of the sequence.\n\nStart at t=18, y=1.\n\nI need to be at y=9 at some turn.\n\nThe constraint is that for t=23 and t=24, y_t should not be in {5,6,7,8}.\n\nSo y_{23} and y_{24} must be in {0,1,2,3,4,9}.\n\nSimilarly, at other times, no problem.\n\nNow, since I start at y=1, and need to go to y=9, I can go up as fast as possible, but avoid being on 5-8 at t=23,24.\n\nThe times t=23,24 are fixed.\n\nNow, let me list the turns: t=18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,...\n\nAt t=18, y=1.\n\nSuppose I go up each turn until I need to avoid.\n\nAt t=19, y=2\n\nt=20, y=3\n\nt=21, y=4\n\nNow at t=21, y=4, which is safe.\n\nNext, if I go up to y=5 at t=22, which is safe, as before.\n\nBut then at t=23, if I go to y=6, it would be bad.\n\nI could stay at y=4 or y=5 for an extra turn.\n\nBut at t=22, y=5 is safe, but t=23 is dangerous for y=5-8.\n\nAt t=23, if I am on y=5, it would be collision since freeway 5 at t=23 covered.\n\nSimilarly for y=6,7,8.\n\nSo at t=23, I cannot be on 5,6,7,8.\n\nSimilarly t=24.\n\nNow, at t=22, I can be on y=4 or y=5 or other.\n\ny=4 is safe at all times.\n\ny=5 is safe at t=22 (τ=4), but not at t=23 (τ=5).\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo, one way: at t=22, instead of going to y=5, I stay at y=4 or go down, but going down might not help.\n\nSince y=4 is safe, I can stay at y=4 for one turn to avoid moving to y=5 at a bad time.\n\nLet's see.\n\nAt t=21, y=4.\n\nI choose a_{21}, which sets y_{22}.\n\nIf I choose S, stay, then y_{22} =4 (since at turn t=21, action S, y_{t+1} = y_t +0, so y_{22}=4)\n\nThen at turn t=22, y=4, which is safe.\n\nThen I choose a_{22}, which sets y_{23}.\n\nNow, if I go up to y=5, but at t=23, y=5 would be on freeway 5 at t=23, which is dangerous.\n\nSo not good.\n\nIf I stay again at t=22, y_{23} =4 or something.\n\nSet actions.\n\nAt t=21, y=4, I can choose a_{21} = S, so y_{22} =4\n\nThen at t=22, y=4, choose a_{22}, if I choose U, y_{23}=5, but at t=23, y=5, collision.\n\nIf I choose S, y_{23}=4\n\nThen at t=23, y=4, which is safe, since y=4 not dangerous at t=23.\n\nThen I can go up later.\n\nBut at t=23, y=4, safe.\n\nThen at t=23, choose a_{23}, say U, y_{24}=5\n\nBut at t=24, y=5, t=24 is τ=6, for freeway 5, covered, so collision at t=24.\n\nProblem.\n\nIf at t=23, y=4, I choose to go up to y=5 at t=24, but at t=24, y=5 is dangerous.\n\nI could go down to y=3 or something, but that might delay.\n\nSince t=24 is dangerous, I need to avoid being on 5-8 at t=24 as well.\n\nAfter t=24, it's safe.\n\nSo I need to be on y=4 or below at t=23 and t=24, or on y=9.\n\nBut y=9 is far.\n\nFor example, at t=23 and t=24, stay on y=4.\n\nThen after that, go up quickly.\n\nSo let's try.\n\nStart: t=18, y=1\n\na_{18} = U, y_{19} =2\n\nt=19, y=2, a_{19} = U, y_{20}=3\n\nt=20, y=3, a_{20} = U, y_{21}=4\n\nt=21, y=4, now instead of going up, I stay: a_{21} = S, so y_{22} =4\n\nt=22, y=4, I need to avoid going to y=5 at t=23 or later.\n\nAt t=22, y=4, I can choose to stay again: a_{22} = S, so y_{23} =4\n\nt=23, y=4, which is safe.\n\nNow at t=23, I choose a_{23}, if I go up, y_{24} =5\n\nBut at t=24, y=5, which is dangerous.\n\nIf I stay, y_{24} =4\n\nThen at t=24, y=4, safe.\n\nThen after that, go up.\n\nBut at t=24, y=4, choose a_{24} = U, y_{25} =5\n\nNow t=25, y=5, τ=25-18=7, for freeway 5, τ=7, not covered, safe.\n\nSimilarly, then I can go up each turn to y=9.\n\nt=25, y=5, a_{25} = U, y_{26} =6\n\nt=26, y=6, a_{26} = U, y_{27} =7\n\nt=27, y=7, a_{27} = U, y_{28} =8\n\nt=28, y=8, a_{28} = U, y_{29} =9\n\nNow at t=29, y=9, reached.\n\nBut this took many turns: from t=18 to t=29, that's 11 turns? Let's count.\n\nt=18: start y=1\n\nAfter actions:\n\nt=19: y=2\n\nt=20: y=3\n\nt=21: y=4\n\nt=22: y=4 (stayed)\n\nt=23: y=4 (stayed)\n\nt=24: y=4 (stayed? no)\n\nAt t=22, y=4, a_{22}=S, y_{23}=4\n\nt=23, y=4, a_{23}=S, y_{24}=4? a_{23} sets y_{24}\n\nIf a_{23}=S, y_{24}=4\n\nThen t=24, y=4, safe.\n\nThen a_{24}=U, y_{25}=5\n\nt=25, y=5, safe (τ=7)\n\na_{25}=U, y_{26}=6\n\nt=26, y=6, τ=8, safe\n\na_{26}=U, y_{27}=7\n\nt=27, y=7, τ=9, safe\n\na_{27}=U, y_{28}=8\n\nt=28, y=8, τ=10, safe\n\na_{28}=U, y_{29}=9\n\nt=29, y=9, reached.\n\nNumber of actions from t=18 to t=28? From t=18 to t=29, but the position changes from y=1 at t=18 to y=9 at t=29.\n\nThe sequence of actions: actions at t=18 to t=28, 11 actions? Let's list the turns when actions are taken.\n\nI need actions for turns starting from t₁=18 to some H-1.\n\nAt turn t, action a_t determines y_{t+1}.\n\nSo to have y_{t} =9 at some t.\n\nIn this case, y_{29} =9, so actions from t=18 to t=28, that's 11 actions: a18 to a28.\n\nBut H is the number of turns, I think H is the number of actions or the time steps.\n\nThe problem says: \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t₁ + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAnd \"y_{t₁ + H - 1} =9\"\n\nSo at time t₁ + H - 1, position is 9.\n\nIn this case, if y_{29} =9, and t₁=18, so 18 + H -1 =29, so 17 + H =29, H=12.\n\nt₁ + H -1 =29, t₁=18, so 18 + H -1 =29, 17 + H =29, H=12.\n\nBut number of actions: from t=18 to t=28, that's 11 actions? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence is {a_{t₁ + t} for t=0 to H-1}\n\nSo for t=0, a_{t₁ +0} = a_{18}\n\nt=1, a_{19}\n\n...\n\nup to t=H-1, a_{t₁ + H -1}\n\nThen after that, at turn t₁ + H, position is set, but y_{t₁ + H} is determined by a_{t₁ + H -1}, and we want y_{t₁ + H -1} =9? No.\n\nLet's read.\n\n\"y_{t₁ + H - 1} =9\"\n\nAnd the actions are for turns from t₁ to t₁ + H -1.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t₁ + H, the position is y_{t₁ + H}, but we want y at turn t₁ + H -1 to be 9.\n\nThe position at turn T is y_T.\n\nAfter choosing a sequence of H actions, at turn t₁ + H -1, y_{t₁ + H -1} should be 9.\n\nFor example, if I start at t₁, y_{t₁} is given, then after action a_{t₁}, y_{t₁+1} is set, and so on, up to after a_{t₁ + H -1}, y_{t₁ + H -1} is set to 9? No.\n\nAt turn t, we choose a_t, then y_{t+1} is determined.\n\nSo at turn t₁, we choose a_{t₁}, which affects y_{t₁+1}\n\nAt turn t₁+1, choose a_{t₁+1}, affects y_{t₁+2}, and so on.\n\nAfter H actions, we have set y_{t₁+1}, y_{t₁+2}, ..., up to y_{t₁ + H}\n\nBut we want y_{t₁ + H -1} =9? That seems odd.\n\nLet's read the problem.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t₁ + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAnd \"y_{t₁ + H -1} =9\"\n\nI think it means that after H turns, starting from t₁, after H actions, at time t₁ + H, but it says y_{t₁ + H -1} =9.\n\nPerhaps it's a bit confusing.\n\nMaybe the actions are applied, and at the turn after H actions, position is 9.\n\nStandard: at time t, position y_t.\n\nAfter action at t, y_{t+1} is new position.\n\nWe start at t₁ with y_{t₁}.\n\nWe apply actions a_{t₁}, a_{t₁+1}, ..., a_{t₁ + H -1}\n\nThen y_{t₁ + H} is the position after H actions.\n\nBut we want to reach (0,9), so y_{t₁ + H} =9.\n\nBut the problem says y_{t₁ + H -1} =9.\n\nLet me check.\n\n\" y_{t₁ + H -1} =9 \"\n\nAnd the sequence is {a_{t₁ + t} for t=0 to H-1, which are actions at times t₁ to t₁+H-1.\n\nAfter that, at time t₁+H, y_{t₁+H} is set, but we want y at time t₁+H-1 to be 9.\n\ny_{t₁+H-1} is the position before the last action or something.\n\nFor example, at time t₁+H-1, position is y_{t₁+H-1}, and we may or may not apply action there.\n\nI think there's inconsistency.\n\nPerhaps the actions include the move to reach the position.\n\nLet's see the player update.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t, choose a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nSo at turn t, we are at y_t.\n\nAfter choosing a_t, we move to y_{t+1} at turn t+1.\n\nTo be at (0,9) at some turn, say T, we need y_T =9.\n\nThe actions are chosen from turn t₁ to turn T-1 to reach y_T=9.\n\nIn the sequence, for H turns, it means H actions to reach the position.\n\nThe problem says: \"the minimal number of turns H\" and \"y_{t₁ + H -1} =9\"\n\nAlso, the sequence is for t=0 to H-1, a_{t₁ + t}\n\nSo for t=0, a_{t₁}, which sets y_{t₁+1}\n\nt=1, a_{t₁+1}, sets y_{t₁+2}\n\n...\n\nt=H-1, a_{t₁ + H -1}, sets y_{t₁ + H}\n\nBut we want y_{t₁ + H -1} =9, which is before the last action.\n\nThat doesn't make sense because y_{t₁ + H -1} is set by previous actions, not by a_{t₁ + H -1}.\n\na_{t₁ + H -1} sets y_{t₁ + H}, not y_{t₁ + H -1}.\n\nSo there might be a mistake in the problem statement or my understanding.\n\nPerhaps \"turns\" refers to the time steps including the start.\n\nAnother possibility: \"turns\" means the number of time steps from start to finish.\n\nFor example, from turn t₁ to turn T when position is 9, the number of turns elapsed is T - t₁.\n\nThen H = T - t₁, so at turn t₁ + H, y_{t₁ + H} =9.\n\nThen the actions are from t₁ to t₁ + H -1, H actions.\n\nThen y_{t₁ + H} =9.\n\nBut the problem says y_{t₁ + H -1} =9, which is different.\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t₁ + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAnd \"y_{t₁ + H -1} =9\"\n\nAlso in the answer format, it shows actions from turn t₁ to t₁ + something.\n\nFor example, \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc.\n\nSo I think it's intended that y_{t₁ + H -1} =9, meaning that at the turn when we reach y=9, it is turn t₁ + H -1.\n\nSo for example, if we reach at turn T, then T = t₁ + H -1, so H = T - t₁ +1.\n\nThen the actions are from t₁ to T-1, so H-1 actions.\n\nLet's calculate.\n\nSet T = turn when y_T =9.\n\nThen from t₁ to T, there are T - t₁ +1 positions, but actions from t₁ to T-1, number of actions: (T-1) - t₁ +1 = T - t₁.\n\nThen H is the number of turns, which should be T - t₁ +1? But the problem says H turns with y_{t₁ + H -1} =9.\n\nSo if y_{t₁ + H -1} =9, then the reaching turn is t = t₁ + H -1.\n\nAnd actions from t= t₁ to t= t₁ + H -2? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence {a_{t₁ + t} for t=0 to H-1, so a_{t₁} to a_{t₁ + H -1}\n\nThen these actions determine y_{t₁+1} to y_{t₁ + H}\n\nBut we want y_{t₁ + H -1} =9.\n\ny_{t₁ + H -1} is determined by a_{t₁} to a_{t₁ + H -2}, not by a_{t₁ + H -1}.\n\na_{t₁ + H -1} determines y_{t₁ + H}, not y_{t₁ + H -1}.\n\nSo it's inconsistent.\n\nPerhaps for the position at turn t, it is before the action.\n\nI think there might be a confusion in the notation.\n\nLet's assume that at turn t, we are at position y_t, then we choose action a_t, which determines y_{t+1} for the next turn.\n\nTo have y_T =9 for some T.\n\nThe actions to choose are from t=t₁ to t=T-1.\n\nThe number of actions is K = T - t₁.\n\nThen H should be the number of turns, which might be K or K+1.\n\nBut the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and y_{t₁ + H -1} =9.\n\nAlso, in the answer, it lists actions from t₁ to t₁ + H-1.\n\nFor example, if H=1, then actions from t=0 to 0, a_{t₁}, and y_{t₁ +1-1} = y_{t₁} =9, but y_{t₁} is given, not set by action, so only if already at 9.\n\nBut here not.\n\nSo for H=1, it would require y_{t₁} =9, but it's 1, not 9.\n\nSo H must be at least 2 or something.\n\nI think it's better to assume that \"turns\" includes the start turn.\n\nPerhaps the sequence of actions brings us to y=9 at the turn after the last action.\n\nI think for simplicity, I'll assume that we need to reach y=9 at some turn T, with minimal T - t₁, and actions from t₁ to T-1.\n\nThen in the answer, for the sequence, H = T - t₁, actions from t₁ to t₁ + H -1 = T-1.\n\nThen y_T =9.\n\nBut the problem says y_{t₁ + H -1} =9, which would be y_T =9 if T = t₁ + H -1, so H = T - t₁ +1.\n\nThen for example, if I reach at T, H = T - t₁ +1, actions from t₁ to t₁ + (H-1) -1? Let's stop.\n\nI think for this problem, since it's a bit messy, I'll define T as the turn when we reach y=9.\n\nThen the number of actions is T - t₁.\n\nThe minimal number of turns H can be thought of as the number of actions, or the time elapsed.\n\nBut to match the format, I'll proceed with the sequence.\n\nIn my earlier path, I reached y=9 at t=29, t₁=18, so T=29, actions from t=18 to 28, 11 actions.\n\nH for the number of turns, if H is the number of actions, then H=11, and y_{t₁ + H -1} = y_{18+11-1} = y_{28}, but in that case, at t=28, y=8, not 9. y_{28}=8, then a_{28}=U, y_{29}=9.\n\nSo y_{28} not 9.\n\nIf H is such that y_{t₁ + H -1} =9, then in that case, at t=29, y=9, so t₁ + H -1 =29, 18 + H -1 =29, H=12.\n\nThen actions from t=0 to H-1=11, so a_{18} to a_{28}, 12 actions? t from 0 to 11 for H=12.\n\nt=0: a_{t₁+0} = a_{18}\n\nt=1: a_{19}\n\n...\n\nt=11: a_{18+11} = a_{29}? t up to H-1=11, a_{t₁ +11} = a_{18+11} = a_{29}\n\nBut a_{29} would set y_{30}, which is after we reached y=9 at t=29.\n\nThat doesn't make sense.\n\nI think there's a mistake in the problem statement.\n\nPerhaps the actions include the move to reach the position at the same turn.\n\nBut from the dynamics, it's clear that action at t affects position at t+1.\n\nSo I think for practical purposes, I'll define the reach turn T, and the number of actions is T - t₁, and list actions from t₁ to T-1.\n\nThen for the answer, H = T - t₁, and the sequence is a_{t₁} to a_{t₁ + H -1} = a_{T-1}, and y_T =9.\n\nBut the problem wants y_{t₁ + H -1} =9, so to satisfy, set T = t₁ + H -1, so that y_T = y_{t₁ + H -1} =9.\n\nThen the actions are from t₁ to T-1 = t₁ to (t₁ + H -1) -1 = t₁ to t₁ + H -2.\n\nThen the sequence has H-1 actions, from t=0 to H-2 for the indices.\n\nThis is messy.\n\nI think for this problem, since the collision depends on the position at each turn, I'll focus on the sequence to reach y=9 quickly while avoiding collision at each step.\n\nIn my earlier slow path, I used 11 actions to reach at t=29, but I can do better.\n\nSince the dangerous times are only t=23 and 24, I can pass y=5-8 before or after.\n\nFor example, I can reach y=4 earlier, then stay, then after t=24, go up.\n\nBut I start at y=1 at t=18.\n\nI can go up faster to y=4 or 5 before t=23.\n\nFor example, from t=18 y=1, go up to y=2 at t=19, y=3 at t=20, y=4 at t=21.\n\nThen at t=21, y=4, I can go up to y=5 at t=22.\n\nt=22, y=5, safe as τ=4.\n\nThen at t=22, y=5, I need to set y for t=23.\n\nIf I go up to y=6, t=23 y=6 collision.\n\nIf I stay at y=5, t=23 y=5 collision.\n\nIf I go down to y=4, then t=23 y=4 safe.\n\nThen at t=23, y=4, I can go up to y=5 at t=24, but t=24 y=5 collision.\n\nOr stay or go down.\n\nGo down to y=3 at t=24, safe, but then I have to come back.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo better to stay on safe row during dangerous times.\n\nSince y=5 is safe at t=22, but I can go to y=6 at t=23 only if it were safe, but it's not.\n\nAnother idea: I can go up to y=8 before t=23, for example.\n\nAt t=18 y=1\n\na18 U, y19=2\n\na19 U, y20=3\n\na20 U, y21=4\n\na21 U, y22=5\n\nt=22 y=5 safe.\n\nNow from here, to go to y=6, but at t=23 if I am on y=6, bad.\n\nBut I can go up to y=6 at a later time.\n\nAt t=22, y=5, I can choose to go down to y=4 or stay, but going down delays.\n\nOr, since I can move to y=6 only at t=23 or later, but t=23 is bad.\n\nSo I must not be on y=6 at t=23.\n\nSimilarly for other.\n\nThe only way is to be on y=4 or below at t=23 and t=24.\n\nThen after t=24, go up.\n\nBut t=24 is turn 24, after that t=25.\n\nFrom y=1 to y=4, it takes 3 steps: from t=18 y=1, to t=19 y=2, t=20 y=3, t=21 y=4, that's 3 actions, at t=21 y=4.\n\nThen I need to stay at y=4 for turns t=22, t=23, t=24.\n\nAt t=21, y=4, choose a21=S, so y22=4\n\nt=22, y=4, choose a22=S, so y23=4\n\nt=23, y=4, choose a23=S, so y24=4\n\nt=24, y=4, safe.\n\nThen at t=24, choose a24=U, y25=5\n\nt=25, y=5, safe (τ=7)\n\na25=U, y26=6\n\nt=26, y=6, safe\n\na26=U, y27=7\n\nt=27, y=7, safe\n\na27=U, y28=8\n\nt=28, y=8, safe\n\na28=U, y29=9\n\nt=29, y=9.\n\nReached at t=29 with actions from t=18 to t=28.\n\nNumber of actions: 11.\n\nBut I can reach earlier by going up to y=5 before and coming back or something, but that might not save time.\n\nSince y=5 is safe at t=22, I can be on y=5 at t=22, then at t=22, instead of staying, I can go down to y=4 for t=23, but then at t=23 y=4 safe, then at t=23, I can go up to y=5 for t=24, but t=24 y=5 collision, so I have to stay at y=4 or go down.\n\nNo gain.\n\nGo up to y=6 after t=24.\n\nBut to be on y=6 at t=25, etc.\n\nThe earliest I can be on y=5 after t=24 is t=25.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut I can be on y=4 at t=21, then if I go up at t=21 to y=5 at t=22, then I have to deal with t=23 and 24.\n\nBut I can't be on 5-8 at those times.\n\nSo the minimal time is to be at y=4 during t=23 and 24, then go up to y=9 in 5 more steps: to y=5,6,7,8,9.\n\nFrom y=4 to y=9, 5 steps: at t=24 y=4, a24 U, y25=5, t25 y5, a25 U, y26=6, t26 y6, a26 U, y27=7, t27 y7, a27 U, y28=8, t28 y8, a28 U, y29=9.\n\nt29 y9.\n\nBut at t=24, if y=4, it's before going up.\n\nIn the sequence, at t=24 y=4, then action to go up.\n\nBut to have y=4 at t=24, I need to be there from earlier.\n\nStart: t18 y1, a18 U, y19=2\n\nt19 y2, a19 U, y20=3\n\nt20 y3, a20 U, y21=4\n\nt21 y4, a21 S, y22=4 (stay)\n\nt22 y4, a22 S, y23=4\n\nt23 y4, a23 S, y24=4\n\nt24 y4, a24 U, y25=5\n\n...\n\nsame as before.\n\nTo save time, can I reach a higher y before t=23?\n\nFor example, from t=18 to t=22, I can be at y=5.\n\nt18 y1, a18 U, y19=2\n\nt19 y2, a19 U, y20=3\n\nt20 y3, a20 U, y21=4\n\nt21 y4, a21 U, y22=5\n\nt22 y5, safe.\n\nNow at t22, y5, I need to avoid being on y5-8 at t=23 and t=24.\n\nSo I can go down to y4 at t=23.\n\na22 D, so y23=4\n\nt23 y4, safe.\n\nThen at t23, y4, I can go up to y5 at t24, but t24 y5 collision.\n\nSo not good.\n\nGo down to y3 at t24.\n\na23 D, y24=3\n\nt24 y3, safe.\n\nThen at t24, y3, a24 U, y25=4\n\nt25 y4, a25 U, y26=5\n\nt26 y5, safe\n\na26 U, y27=6\n\netc, to y9 at t30 or later, worse.\n\nSo not better.\n\nStay at y5 at t22, but then at t22, if I stay, a22 S, y23=5, but t23 y5 collision.\n\nMust move down.\n\nSo no, the fastest is to stay at y4 during the dangerous period.\n\nBut can I reach y=8 before t=23?\n\nFor example, from t=18 to t=22, I can go up 4 times, to y=5 at t=22.\n\nTo go to y=6, I need to be at y=6 at some point.\n\nAt t=22, y=5, I can go to y=6 at t=23, but t=23 dangerous.\n\nI can't reach y=6 before t=23 because at t=22, I am at y=5, and to be at y=6 at t=23, I need to go up at t=22, which sets y23=6, but then at t=23 y6 collision.\n\nSo impossible to be on y=6 or higher before t=23, since I start from y=1 at t=18.\n\nMax I can be at t=22 is y=5, as above.\n\nSimilarly, after t=24, I can be on y=5 at t=25.\n\nThen go up to y=9 at t=29.\n\nSame as before.\n\nBut at t=24, if I am on y=4, I can go up to y=5 at t=25, etc.\n\nBut at t=24, I can be on y=4 or lower.\n\nAnother idea: since y=9 is safe, I can go directly to y=9 if possible, but I have to move step by step.\n\nOr, I can be on y=9 at t=23 or t=24, but to be on y=9 at t=23, I need to be at y=9 at that turn.\n\nFrom y=1 at t=18, to y=9 at t=23, that's 5 steps up in 5 turns? From t=18 to t=23, 5 turns later.\n\nAt t=18 y1\n\na18 U, y19=2\n\na19 U, y20=3\n\na20 U, y21=4\n\na21 U, y22=5\n\na22 U, y23=6\n\nBut at t=23 y6 collision, not 9.\n\nTo reach y=9 at t=23, I need to go up 8 steps from t=18 to t=23, but that's only 5 actions, impossible.\n\nNumber of actions from t=18 to t=22 to set y23.\n\nActions at t=18 to t=22 set y19 to y23.\n\n5 actions, can increase y by at most 5, from 1 to 6, not to 9.\n\nSo impossible to be at y=9 before t=26 at earliest, with 8 up actions.\n\nt=18 y1\n\nAfter 1 action, t=19 y2\n\n2 actions, t=20 y3\n\n3 actions, t=21 y4\n\n4 actions, t=22 y5\n\n5 actions, t=23 y6\n\n6 actions, t=24 y7\n\n7 actions, t=25 y8\n\n8 actions, t=26 y9\n\nSo earliest possible is t=26 with 8 up actions, but at t=23 y6 collision, t=24 y7 collision, so not possible without waiting.\n\nWith waiting, the best is t=29 as above.\n\nBut at t=25, I can be on y=5, then to y=9 in 4 more turns, t=29.\n\nBut let's see if I can be on a safe position at t=23 and t=24 and still reach faster.\n\nFor example, at t=23, if I am on y=9, but I can't reach that early.\n\nOr on y=0, but from y=1, going down to y=0 at t=19 or something, but that might not help.\n\nSuppose at t=18 y1, I go down to y0 at t=19.\n\nBut y=0 is safe, but then I have to come up, so it takes more time.\n\nFor example, a18 D, y19=0\n\nt19 y0, a19 U, y20=1\n\nt20 y1, a20 U, y21=2\n\netc, slower.\n\nNot better.\n\nSo the minimal time is to stay at y=4 from t=21 to t=24, then go up to y=9 by t=29.\n\nBut at t=24, I am at y=4, then go up.\n\nNumber of turns from start: at t=18 start, to t=29 reach, 11 turns elapsed, but with actions.\n\nReached at turn 29, so T=29, t1=18, number of actions: 11.\n\nBut for the answer, with the H definition.\n\nPerhaps I can save one turn.\n\nNotice that at t=22, I can be on y=5, which is safe, then at t=22, I go down to y=4 for t=23.\n\nThen at t=23, y=4, safe.\n\nThen at t=23, I can go down further or stay.\n\nBut to avoid t=24 on y=5-8.\n\nAt t=23, y=4, if I go up to y=5, t=24 y5 collision.\n\nSo I must not go to y=5 at t=24.\n\nSo at t=23, I can stay at y=4 or go down.\n\nSay stay at y=4 for t=24.\n\na23 S, y24=4\n\nThen same as before.\n\nOr, since at t=24, if I go to y=5, collision, but I can go to y=6 or higher, but at t=24, y=6 is also dangerous for freeway 6.\n\nAll y=5,6,7,8 dangerous at t=24.\n\nSo I have to be on y=4 or below at t=24.\n\nSo no choice.\n\nThus the sequence I have is minimal time.\n\nBut let's confirm the actions.\n\nActions:\n\nAt turn 18: choose U, so y19=2\n\nTurn 19: U, y20=3\n\nTurn 20: U, y21=4\n\nTurn 21: S, y22=4 (stay)\n\nTurn 22: S, y23=4 (stay)\n\nTurn 23: S, y24=4 (stay)\n\nTurn 24: U, y25=5\n\nTurn 25: U, y26=6\n\nTurn 26: U, y27=7\n\nTurn 27: U, y28=8\n\nTurn 28: U, y29=9\n\nReached at turn 29.\n\nNow for the answer, H is the number of turns.\n\nAccording to the problem, y_{t1 + H -1} =9, so t1 + H -1 =29, 18 + H -1=29, H=12.\n\nThen the sequence of actions is from t=0 to H-1=11, so 12 actions? t from 0 to 11, a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to 11.\n\nt=0: a18\n\nt=1: a19\n\nt=2: a20\n\nt=3: a21\n\nt=4: a22\n\nt=5: a23\n\nt=6: a24\n\nt=7: a25\n\nt=8: a26\n\nt=9: a27\n\nt=10: a28\n\nt=11: a29\n\nBut a29 sets y30, but we reached at y29, so no need for a29.\n\nThe last action is a28 which sets y29=9.\n\nIn the sequence, actions up to a28.\n\nFor H=12, t from 0 to 11, a18 to a29, but a29 is extra.\n\nIf H=11, then y_{t1 + H -1} = y_{18+11-1}=y28, which is 8, not 9.\n\nSo to have y_{t1 + H -1} =9, it must be that we reach at that turn with no further action needed, but in the dynamics, position is updated after action.\n\nI think there's a inconsistency, but for the sake of this problem, I'll provide the sequence of actions as above.\n\nPerhaps the \"turns\" refer to the actions taken.\n\nI think I should look for a shorter path.\n\nAnother idea: at t=22, I am at y=5, safe.\n\nThen instead of going down, I can go up to y=6 at t=23, but collision.\n\nUnless I can be not on the freeway at that time, but I have to be.\n\nOr, move to y=7 at t=24, but from y=5 at t=22, a22 U, y23=6, t23 y6 collision, can't reach y=7 directly.\n\nSo no.\n\nPerhaps for freeways 5-8, the coverage is at t=23 and 24, but for y=5, it is dangerous at t=23 and 24, similarly for all.\n\nBut at t=25, y=5 is safe, etc.\n\nSo I think 11 actions is minimal.\n\nBut let's see the car on freeway 5-8: the car that causes problem is the one with head -30, tail -41 at t1.\n\nAt τ=5, t=23, position: tail +6*5= -41+30= -11, head +30=0, so span [-11,0], so 0 is included.\n\nSimilarly τ=6, [-5,6], 0 included.\n\nAt τ=4, [-17,-6], 0 not included.\n\nτ=7, [1,6], 0 not included.\n\nSo only those times.\n\nSo no other times dangerous.\n\nThus, the sequence is as above.\n\nFor the answer, I'll write the actions from turn 18 to turn 28.\n\nH=11 for the number of actions.\n\nBut the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and in the box, list the actions.\n\nPerhaps I can reach at t=28 or something.\n\nSuppose I go up to y=4 at t=21.\n\nThen at t=21, instead of staying, I go up to y=5 at t=22.\n\nThen at t=22, y=5, I go down to y=4 at t=23.\n\na22 D, y23=4\n\nt23 y4, safe.\n\nThen at t23, y4, I go down to y=3 at t24.\n\na23 D, y24=3\n\nt24 y3, safe.\n\nThen at t24, y3, a24 U, y25=4\n\nt25 y4, a25 U, y26=5\n\nt26 y5, a26 U, y27=6\n\nt27 y6, a27 U, y28=7\n\nt28 y7, a28 U, y29=8\n\na29 U, y30=9, reached at t=30, worse.\n\nSo not better.\n\nAt t23 y4, I can go up to y=5 at t24, but collision, so no.\n\nSo the first sequence is best.\n\nThus actions:\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nTurn 20: U\n\nTurn 21: S\n\nTurn 22: S\n\nTurn 23: S\n\nTurn 24: U\n\nTurn 25: U\n\nTurn 26: U\n\nTurn 27: U\n\nTurn 28: U\n\nWith y at t29=9.\n\nFor the answer, since the problem asks for sequence from t1 to t1+H-1 with y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nSo set T=29, t1=18, so t1+H-1=29, H-1=11, H=12.\n\nThen actions for t=0 to 11: a18 to a29.\n\nBut a29 is not needed, and y29 is set by a28.\n\nIf I include a29, it would set y30, but we don't care.\n\nPerhaps the last action is to stay or something, but at y=9, no need to move.\n\nI think it's better to list only necessary actions.\n\nPerhaps in the context, H is the number of actions.\n\nI think for the output, I'll list the actions as above from turn 18 to turn 28.\n\nAnd H=11.\n\nBut to match the format, let's see the answer format.\n\n\" \\boxed{ Turn t_1: a_{t_1} Turn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1} ... } \"\n\nSo for this, from turn 18 to turn 28.\n\n10 actions? Turn 18 to 28 inclusive is 11 turns.\n\nTurn 18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28: 11 actions.\n\nThen y29=9.\n\nIf I must have y at the turn of the last action, but at turn 28, y=8, not 9.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nPerhaps the position is after the action, but the collision is during the turn.\n\nI think I should proceed.\n\nAnother thought: at t=24, if I am on y=4, and I go up, y25=5, but at t=24, I am on y=4, safe.\n\nNo issue.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n\nBut let's see if I can reach at t=28.\n\nTo reach y=9 at t=28, I need y28=9.\n\nFrom y1 at t18, in 10 turns, with 10 actions, can increase by 10, to y11, impossible, max to y11, but y=9, so possible with some down or stay, but to reach faster, but with collision constraint.\n\nMin actions to go from y1 to y9 is 8 up, but with waits.\n\nWith 8 actions, I can be at y9 at t26, but at t23 y6 collision, etc.\n\nSo not possible.\n\nWith 9 actions, at t27 y9? Actions from t18 to t25 set y19 to y26.\n\n5 actions to set y26, can be y6 to y10, so y9 possible at t26 with 8 actions, but at t23 y6 collision if I go straight.\n\nFor example, to be at y9 at t26.\n\nThen actions t18 to t25.\n\ny19=2, y20=3, y21=4, y22=5, y23=6, but t23 y6 collision, so must not be on y6 at t23.\n\nBut t23 is when I would be on y6 if I go up.\n\nSo I need to be on different y at t23.\n\nSay at t23, I am on y4, then to reach y9 at t26, I need from y4 to y9 in 3 steps, impossible, min 5 steps.\n\nAt t23 y4, then y24, y25, y26, only 3 positions, can be y7 at t26, not y9.\n\nTo have y26=9, I need to have been at y8 at t25, etc.\n\nBut at t23, if I am on y4, then at t24, I can be y5, t25 y6, t26 y7, not y9.\n\nSo impossible to reach before t29 with the constraint.\n\nSimilarly, t28 y9: need y28=9, so at t27 y8, t26 y7, t25 y6, t24 y5, but at t24 y5 collision if on y5 at t24.\n\nIf I can be on y5 at t24 only if not dangerous, but it is.\n\nSo no, earliest t29.\n\nThus the sequence is minimal.\n\nFor the answer, I'll write:\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 1) at turn \\(t_1 = 18\\). The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\nCars on freeways \\(y = 5\\) to \\(y = 8\\) cover \\(x = 0\\) at turns \\(t = 23\\) and \\(t = 24\\) (i.e., \\(\\tau = 5\\) and \\(\\tau = 6\\) from \\(t_1 = 18\\)), making these freeways unsafe at those turns. Freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 4\\) are always safe, as no cars cover \\(x = 0\\) for \\(\\tau \\geq 0\\). The position \\(y = 9\\) has no cars and is safe.\n\nTo minimize the number of turns, the player should ascend as quickly as possible but avoid being on freeways \\(y = 5\\) to \\(y = 8\\) at \\(t = 23\\) and \\(t = 24\\). The strategy is:\n- Move up to \\(y = 4\\) by turn \\(t = 21\\).\n- Stay at \\(y = 4\\) for turns \\(t = 22\\), \\(t = 23\\), and \\(t = 24\\) to avoid the dangerous freeways during the critical turns.\n- After \\(t = 24\\), move up directly to \\(y = 9\\).\n\nThe sequence of actions and positions is as follows:\n- At turn 18: \\(a_{18} = U\\), so \\(y_{19} = 2\\) (position at turn 19: (0, 2)).\n- At turn 19: \\(a_{19} = U\\), so \\(y_{20} = 3\\) (position at turn 20: (0, 3)).\n- At turn 20: \\(a_{20} = U\\), so \\(y_{21} = 4\\) (position at turn 21: (0, 4)).\n- At turn 21: \\(a_{21} = S\\), so \\(y_{22} = 4\\) (position at turn 22: (0, 4)).\n- At turn 22: \\(a_{22} = S\\), so \\(y_{23} = 4\\) (position at turn 23: (0, 4)).\n- At turn 23: \\(a_{23} = S\\), so \\(y_{24} = 4\\) (position at turn 24: (0, 4)).\n- At turn 24: \\(a_{24} = U\\), so \\(y_{25} = 5\\) (position at turn 25: (0, 5); safe as \\(\\tau = 7\\)).\n- At turn 25: \\(a_{25} = U\\), so \\(y_{26} = 6\\) (position at turn 26: (0, 6); safe as \\(\\tau = 8\\)).\n- At turn 26: \\(a_{26} = U\\), so \\(y_{27} = 7\\) (position at turn 27: (0, 7); safe as \\(\\tau = 9\\)).\n- At turn 27: \\(a_{27} = U\\), so \\(y_{28} = 8\\) (position at turn 28: (0, 8); safe as \\(\\tau = 10\\)).\n- At turn 28: \\(a_{28} = U\\), so \\(y_{29} = 9\\) (position at turn 29: (0, 9); goal reached).\n\nThe position \\(y_{29} = 9\\) is reached at turn \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 18 + H - 1 = 29\\), so \\(H = 12\\). The sequence of actions for \\(t = 0\\) to \\(H-1 = 11\\) is given above, with the last action at turn 28 setting \\(y_{29} = 9\\).\n\nThis sequence achieves the goal in \\(H = 12\\) turns, which is minimal given the collision constraints.\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 18: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 19: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 20: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 21: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 22: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 23: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 24: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 25: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 26: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 27: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 28: U }",

The goal is to reach (0,9) in minimal turns H, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S). The movement is only in the y-direction (vertical). The grid has y from 0 to 9.\n\nThe car update rules: \n- For a car on freeway i, at turn t1 we are given the head (h) and tail (tau), direction (d), and speed (s). \n- For a left-moving car: the span at time T (>= t1) is [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)] \n  (note: the problem states for left-moving: Span(t1)=[h, tau] -> at T: [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\n  But note: typically for left-moving, the head is the leftmost? However, the problem says:\n    Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, tau] -> becomes [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\n  But in the example, the cars are given with head and tail, and for right-moving: they give [tau, h] and then [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n  So, for left-moving, the head is the leading part? Actually, the problem says for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [tau, h]\" meaning from tail (left) to head (right). Similarly, for left-moving, it might be that the head is the leftmost? But note the example: \n\n  However, looking at the data, all cars are right-moving? Because the direction is \"right\" for all. So we only need the right-moving update.\n\nBut wait, the car state table:\n  Freeway 1: two cars: (18,7,right,6) and (-48,-59,right,6)\n  Note: for the first car: at t1=19, the span is [7, 18] (because for right-moving: [tau, h] = [7,18]?) \n  But the problem says for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [tau, h]\" and then at T: [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\n  So for the first car on freeway 1 at t1=19: \n      tau = 7, h = 18, s=6, direction=right.\n      At time t1 (19): the car occupies [7, 18] (x-coordinates).\n\n  How does the collision condition work?\n      Collision occurs at turn T only if the player is on freeway y (which is the player's y-coordinate at that turn) and at that same turn, the car on that freeway has a span that contains 0? \n      Specifically: \"if 0 in Span(T)\" for any car on freeway y_T.\n\n  Important note: the player at turn T is at (0, y_T). The car spans are on the x-axis. So if the car's span at time T covers x=0, then the player collides.\n\n  Also note: the player is only on a freeway if the freeway index is between 1 and 8 (inclusive) and the player's y-coordinate at that turn is that freeway.\n\n  Additionally, note the note: \n      \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} != y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 in Span(T) but 0 not in Span(T+1).\"\n\n  This means: at the moment of moving (at turn T), the player is still on the current freeway (y_T) and only checks the cars on that freeway. Then after the move, at turn T+1, the player is on y_{T+1}.\n\n  Therefore, to avoid collision at turn T, we must ensure that if the player is on freeway k (where k is between 1 and 8) at turn T, then for every car on freeway k at turn T, 0 must not be in the span of that car.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. We are at turn t1=19, at (0,2). We need to get to (0,9). The minimal number of moves without any cars would be 7 moves (all U: 2->3->4->...->9). But we have to avoid cars on freeways 1 to 8.\n\n2. We note that the cars are moving. We are given the state at turn 19.\n\n   For each freeway and each car, we can compute the span at any future turn T (>=19) by:\n      For a right-moving car: \n          span at T = [tau + s*(T-19), h + s*(T-19)]\n\n   But note: the problem says for right-moving: \n        at T: [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\n   However, the given car is (h, tau, d, s). But in the table, the first car on freeway1 is (18,7,right,6). \n        Here, head=18, tail=7? \n        But according to the update for right-moving, they use [tau, h] at t1? \n\n   The problem says: \n        Right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [tau, h]\" -> meaning at t1, the car spans from tau to h? \n        Then at T: [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\n   But note: the numbers: at t1=19, the first car on freeway1: \n        tau = 7, h = 18? Then the span at 19 is [7, 18] and at T: [7+6*(T-19), 18+6*(T-19)]\n\n   However, the problem gives the car as (head, tail, ...). So which is head and which is tail? \n        The update rule for right-moving says: \"Span(t1) = [tau, h]\" meaning the tail is the left end and head is the right end? \n\n   But in the example, the car is (18,7,...): so head=18, tail=7. Then indeed the tail is less than the head? Then [7,18] is the span.\n\n   So the update: at T, the car is at [7+6*(T-19), 18+6*(T-19)]\n\n   Similarly, the second car: (-48,-59,right,6): \n        tail = -59, head = -48 -> span at 19: [-59, -48] \n        at T: [-59+6*(T-19), -48+6*(T-19)]\n\n3. We need to check for each freeway k (from 1 to 8) and for each turn T (>=19) whether the player is on freeway k (i.e., y_T = k) and whether any car on freeway k has 0 in its span at turn T.\n\n4. The player starts at y=2 (freeway 2) at turn 19. So we must check at turn 19: \n   For freeway2: \n        Car1: (18,7,right,6) -> at T=19: [7+6*0, 18+6*0] = [7,18] -> 0 is not in [7,18] -> safe for this car.\n        Car2: (-48,-59,right,6) -> at T=19: [-59, -48] -> 0 is not in [-59,-48] -> safe.\n\n   So turn 19 is safe at freeway2.\n\n5. We need to plan a sequence of actions (U, D, S) to move from y=2 to y=9 in minimal turns without colliding.\n\n   The minimal H is at least 7 (because 2 to 9 is 7 steps up). But we might have to wait (use S) or even go down to avoid a collision? \n\n6. We must compute the positions of the cars for each freeway at each future turn.\n\n   Let T = 19, 20, 21, ... until we can get to 9.\n\n   We note that the player moves at turn T (starting at T=19) and the next state is at T+1.\n\n   We are to output the actions from turn 19 to turn 19+H-1, and at turn 19+H-1 the player is at 9.\n\n   We can use BFS or Dijkstra in the state (turn, y) but note that the turn can be large? However, we note that the cars move linearly and periodically? \n\n   But let's compute the car positions for the next few turns.\n\n   We note that the cars move at 6 units per turn. So the spans shift by 6 per turn to the right.\n\n   The critical point: we are at x=0. So we care when the span of a car on the freeway we are on covers 0.\n\n   For a car with span [a, b] (a<=b) at time T, it covers 0 if a <= 0 <= b.\n\n   Since the cars are moving at 6 per turn, the time when a car covers 0 is periodic? But note multiple cars per freeway.\n\n   Let's compute for each freeway and each car the time intervals (if any) when the car covers 0.\n\n   For a car on freeway k with (h, tau, d, s) = (head, tail, right, 6) at t1=19:\n        Let A0 = tau + 6*(T-19)\n        Let B0 = h + 6*(T-19)\n        We require A0 <= 0 <= B0.\n\n        => tau + 6*(T-19) <= 0 <= h + 6*(T-19)\n\n        => T >= ceil( ( -h ) / 6 + 19 )? Actually, let's solve:\n\n        From 0 >= tau + 6*(T-19)  -> T >= 19 - tau/6   [if tau is negative then this becomes a lower bound?]\n        and 0 <= h + 6*(T-19) -> T >= 19 - h/6? \n\n        Actually, we have:\n          tau + 6*(T-19) <= 0  => T <= 19 - tau/6   ??? Wait:\n\n          tau + 6*(T-19) <= 0  => 6*(T-19) <= -tau  => T-19 <= -tau/6  => T <= 19 - tau/6\n\n        and \n          h + 6*(T-19) >= 0  => 6*(T-19) >= -h  => T-19 >= -h/6  => T >= 19 - h/6\n\n        So the time T must satisfy: 19 - h/6 <= T <= 19 - tau/6.\n\n        But note: since the car is right-moving and the span is [tau+6*(T-19), h+6*(T-19)], which is moving to the right. \n\n        Example: first car on freeway1: tau=7, h=18 -> \n            T must be in [19 - 18/6, 19 - 7/6] = [19-3, 19-1.166...] = [16, 17.833...] -> but T>=19, so no overlap? \n\n        Actually, we have:\n          Lower bound: T >= 19 - 18/6 = 19 - 3 = 16 -> so from T=16 onward? But our T starts at 19. \n          Upper bound: T <= 19 - 7/6 = 19 - 1.166... = 17.833 -> so T<=17.833.\n\n        Therefore, at T=16,17: the car covers 0? But we start at T=19, which is after 17.833 -> so no.\n\n        Similarly, the second car: tau=-59, h=-48 -> \n            T must be in [19 - (-48)/6, 19 - (-59)/6] = [19+8, 19+59/6] = [27, 19+9.833] = [27, 28.833] -> so T=27,28.\n\n        Therefore, on freeway1, the second car will cover 0 at T=27 and T=28.\n\n        Similarly, for freeway2: same cars? The table says freeway2 has the same two cars: (18,7,right,6) and (-48,-59,right,6). So same as freeway1.\n\n        Freeway3: same.\n\n        Freeway4: same.\n\n        Freeway5: three cars: (18,7,right,6), (54,43,right,6), (-24,-35,right,6)\n\n          First car: (18,7) -> same as above -> no collision at T>=19.\n          Second car: (54,43) -> \n              T in [19 - 54/6, 19 - 43/6] = [19-9, 19-7.166] = [10, 11.833] -> T=10,11 -> already passed? So no.\n          Third car: (-24,-35) -> \n              T in [19 - (-24)/6, 19 - (-35)/6] = [19+4, 19+35/6] = [23, 19+5.833] = [23,24.833] -> so T=23,24.\n\n        Similarly, freeway6,7,8: same as freeway5.\n\n7. Summary of dangerous times (when a car covers 0) for each freeway:\n\n   Freeway1: at T=27,28 (from the second car)\n   Freeway2: same as freeway1: T=27,28\n   Freeway3: same: T=27,28\n   Freeway4: same: T=27,28\n   Freeway5: at T=23,24 (from the third car) and also the second car doesn't hit? and the first car doesn't hit? so only T=23,24.\n   Freeway6: same as freeway5: T=23,24\n   Freeway7: same: T=23,24\n   Freeway8: same: T=23,24\n\n   Therefore, we must avoid being on:\n        freeways 1,2,3,4 at turns 27 and 28.\n        freeways 5,6,7,8 at turns 23 and 24.\n\n8. The player starts at turn 19 at y=2 (freeway2). We need to get to y=9.\n\n   The minimal path without waiting: \n        Turn19: at y=2 -> then we can go U repeatedly: \n            T19: y=2 -> action U -> T20: y=3\n            T20: y=3 -> U -> T21: y=4\n            T21: y=4 -> U -> T22: y=5\n            T22: y=5 -> U -> T23: y=6 -> but at T23, freeway6 is dangerous (y=6 is freeway6) -> so we must avoid being on freeway6 at T23.\n\n   So we cannot be at y=6 at T23.\n\n   How to avoid? We can delay or change the path.\n\n   Option 1: Wait at some safe freeway until the danger passes.\n\n   We note:\n        At T23: we must not be on freeways 5,6,7,8 -> so we must be at y=0,1,2,3,4, or 9? \n        But note: freeways are only defined for y=1..8. The player is not on a freeway if y=0 or y=9. \n        However, the goal is (0,9) and we are safe at y=9.\n\n        Also, at T23: if we are at y=0, that's safe (no freeway). Similarly, y=9 is safe.\n\n        But we are at T19: y=2.\n\n        We need to get to y=9. The moves:\n\n        We can try to get to y=4 by T22 (which is safe because at T22, no danger for freeway4? but note: freeway4 is dangerous at T27,28, not T22) and then wait at y=4 for one turn? \n\n        Alternatively, we might try to get to y=5 at T22 and then at T22 we can either go up to y=6 (which would be at T23 -> dangerous) or wait at y=5? \n\n        But at T23, if we are at y=5 -> that is freeway5 -> dangerous! Because freeway5 is dangerous at T23.\n\n        Similarly, if we are at y=4 at T23: freeway4 is not dangerous at T23? freeway4 is only dangerous at T27,28 -> safe.\n\n        So plan:\n\n          T19: at y=2 -> U -> T20: y=3\n          T20: at y=3 -> U -> T21: y=4\n          T21: at y=4 -> S (wait) -> T22: y=4\n          T22: at y=4 -> U -> T23: y=5 -> but freeway5 at T23 is dangerous! -> so we cannot be at y=5 at T23.\n\n        So we need to avoid being at freeways 5,6,7,8 at T23 and T24.\n\n        We can wait two turns at y=4? \n\n          T21: y=4 -> S -> T22: y=4\n          T22: y=4 -> S -> T23: y=4 -> safe (freeway4 is safe at T23)\n          T23: y=4 -> U -> T24: y=5 -> but at T24: freeway5 is dangerous! \n\n        So we cannot be at y=5 at T24 either.\n\n        Therefore, we must avoid freeways 5,6,7,8 at both T23 and T24.\n\n        How about we get to y=3 and wait? \n\n          T19: U -> T20: y=3\n          T20: S -> T21: y=3\n          T21: S -> T22: y=3\n          T22: U -> T23: y=4 -> safe (freeway4 at T23 is safe)\n          T23: U -> T24: y=5 -> but at T24: freeway5 is dangerous -> so we must avoid.\n\n        Alternatively, we can go down to y=1? \n\n        But note: at T23 and T24, freeways 1,2,3,4 are safe? except that freeways 1,2,3,4 are dangerous at T27,28, but not at T23,24.\n\n        So if we are at freeway4 at T24: safe.\n\n        So:\n\n          T19: U -> T20: y=3\n          T20: S -> T21: y=3\n          T21: S -> T22: y=3\n          T22: U -> T23: y=4 (safe)\n          T23: U -> T24: y=5 -> dangerous? yes, because at T24, freeway5 is dangerous.\n\n        We need to avoid being at y=5,6,7,8 at T23 and T24.\n\n        How about we get to y=4 at T23 and then at T24 we stay at y=4? \n\n          T19: U (y=3) -> T20: U (y=4) -> T21: S (y=4) -> T22: S (y=4) -> T23: S (y=4) -> T24: U (y=5) -> but then at T24: we are at y=5 -> dangerous.\n\n        Alternatively, we can get to y=4 at T23 and then at T24 we go up to y=5? but that's dangerous.\n\n        We must wait until T25 to enter freeway5? \n\n        Since freeway5 is dangerous at T23 and T24, then at T25 it should be safe? \n\n        Let's check the third car on freeway5: \n            It covers 0 at T=23 and 24? \n            At T=25: \n                The third car: (-24,-35,right,6): \n                    at T=25: [ -35 + 6*(25-19) = -35+36=1, -24+6*6=-24+36=12 ] -> [1,12] -> 0 not in [1,12] -> safe.\n\n            The other cars on freeway5: \n                (18,7): at T=25: [7+6*6=7+36=43, 18+36=54] -> safe.\n                (54,43): at T=25: [43+36=79, 54+36=90] -> safe.\n\n        So freeway5 is safe at T25.\n\n        Similarly, freeway6,7,8: same cars? so at T25: safe.\n\n        Therefore, we can be at freeway5 at T25 and beyond.\n\n        So we can plan:\n\n          T19: U (y=3) \n          T20: U (y=4)\n          T21: S (y=4)   [wait at y=4 for one turn? but we have to avoid being at freeway5 at T23 and T24, and we are still at freeway4 at T21 and T22?]\n\n          Actually, we need to avoid freeway5 at T23 and T24, but we can be at freeway4 at T23 and T24.\n\n          Then at T24 we can move to freeway5? but that would be at T25? \n\n          How the move works: \n            At turn T, we are at y. We choose an action. Then at the next turn T+1, we are at y + delta.\n\n          So if we are at y=4 at T24, and we choose U at T24, then at T25 we are at y=5.\n\n          And at T25, freeway5 is safe.\n\n        Therefore, we can:\n\n          T19: U -> T20: y=3\n          T20: U -> T21: y=4\n          T21: S -> T22: y=4\n          T22: S -> T23: y=4   (safe: freeway4 at T23 is safe)\n          T23: S -> T24: y=4   (safe: freeway4 at T24 is safe)\n          T24: U -> T25: y=5   (safe: freeway5 at T25 is safe)\n\n          Then we can move up freely: \n          T25: U -> T26: y=6\n          T26: U -> T27: y=7\n\n          But wait: at T27, freeway7 is dangerous? because freeway7 is dangerous at T27? \n            Actually, freeway7 is dangerous at T27? \n            We have: freeway7: same as freeway5: dangerous at T23,24? and safe at T25 and beyond? \n\n          But note: our summary: freeways 1,2,3,4 are dangerous at T27,28. Freeways 5,6,7,8 are dangerous at T23,24. \n\n          So at T27: \n            freeway7 (y=7) is not dangerous? because the danger for freeways 5,6,7,8 was only at T23,24. \n\n          However, we also have freeways 1,2,3,4 dangerous at T27,28. But we are at y=7 at T27, so we are on freeway7 -> safe? \n\n          But wait: our summary for freeways 1-4: they are dangerous at T27,28. Freeways 5-8: dangerous only at T23,24. So at T27, freeway7 is safe.\n\n          Therefore, we can continue:\n\n          T27: U -> T28: y=8\n          T28: U -> T29: y=9 -> goal.\n\n        Total turns: from T19 to T29: that's 11 turns? \n\n        But note: we are to output actions for turns from t1 (19) to t1+H-1. The player is at T19: we take action at T19, then T20, ... until T28 (if we count 10 actions: T19 to T28, then at T29 we are at y=9). \n\n        Actually: \n          T19: action -> at T20: y=3\n          T20: action -> at T21: y=4\n          T21: action -> at T22: y=4\n          T22: action -> at T23: y=4\n          T23: action -> at T24: y=4\n          T24: action -> at T25: y=5\n          T25: action -> at T26: y=6\n          T26: action -> at T27: y=7\n          T27: action -> at T28: y=8\n          T28: action -> at T29: y=9\n\n        So we have taken 10 actions: at T19, T20, T21, T22, T23, T24, T25, T26, T27, T28. Then at T29 we are at y=9 -> so H=10.\n\n        But can we do better?\n\n        We note that we are forced to wait at y=4 for three turns (T21: stay, T22: stay, T23: stay) and then at T24 we move up to y=5. \n\n        However, we might be able to get to a higher freeway earlier? \n\n        Alternatively, we can go up to y=5 earlier, but then we have to avoid being at freeway5 at T23 and T24. \n\n        How about we go to y=5 at T22? \n          Then at T22: we are at freeway5 -> but T22 is not dangerous? because freeway5 is dangerous only at T23,24. \n          So T22: safe. Then at T22 we are at y=5. Then we must not be at y=5 at T23 and T24. \n\n          How? We can move down to y=4 at T23? \n            T22: at y=5 -> action D -> T23: y=4 -> safe (freeway4 at T23 is safe)\n            Then at T23: we are at y=4. Then at T24: we can either stay at y=4 or move? \n            But we want to eventually go up. \n\n          Then T24: we can move up to y=5? -> but at T24: freeway5 is dangerous -> so we cannot be at y=5 at T24.\n\n          So we have to wait at y=4 until T25? \n\n          Then:\n            T19: U -> T20: y=3\n            T20: U -> T21: y=4\n            T21: U -> T22: y=5   (safe at T22)\n            T22: D -> T23: y=4   (safe)\n            T23: S -> T24: y=4   (safe)\n            T24: U -> T25: y=5   (safe at T25)\n            Then same as before: \n            T25: U -> y=6\n            T26: U -> y=7\n            T27: U -> y=8\n            T28: U -> y=9\n\n          This also takes 10 actions: T19 to T28.\n\n        But we did an extra down move? So same number of moves? \n\n        Alternatively, we might avoid the down move by going up to y=6 earlier? \n\n          We cannot be at freeway6 at T23 and T24. \n\n          If we try to be at y=6 at T22: \n            T19: U (y=3)\n            T20: U (y=4)\n            T21: U (y=5) -> safe at T21? freeway5 at T21: not dangerous? \n            T22: U (y=6) -> safe at T22? freeway6 at T22: dangerous only at T23,24 -> so safe at T22.\n\n            Then at T22: we are at y=6. Then we need to avoid being at y=6 at T23 and T24.\n\n            How?

\n\n        How about we go down to y=0 and wait there until T25, then move up? \n\n          T19: D -> T20: y=1\n          T20: D -> T21: y=0\n          T21: S -> T22: y=0\n          T22: S -> T23: y=0\n          T23: S -> T24: y=0\n          T24: U -> T25: y=1   (freeway1: safe at T25)\n          T25: U -> T26: y=2   (freeway2: safe at T26?

\n\n          T24: U (y=1)\n          T25: U (y=2)\n          T26: U (y=3) -> safe at T26 (freeway3 at T26: safe)\n          T27: we must not be at freeway3 -> so we can move up to y=4? -> dangerous at T27 (freeway4) \n                or move up to y=5? -> but that would require two moves from y=3 to y=5 in one turn? impossible.\n\n          So we must be at y>=5 at T27? \n            T27: from y=3 at T26: we can only get to y=4 at T27.\n\n        Therefore, we get stuck.\n\n        We try to wait at y=0 one more turn? \n\n          T24: U (y=1)\n          T25: U (y=2)\n          T26: U (y=3) -> safe at T26\n          T27: we need to be at y>=5? impossible.\n\n        Alternatively, we might move faster from y=0:\n\n          T24: U (y=1)\n          T25: U (y=2)\n          T26: U (y=3)\n          T27: U (y=4) -> dangerous (freeway4 at T27)\n\n        So we have to wait at y=0 until T25? \n\n          T19: D (1)\n          T20: D (0)\n          T21: S (0)\n          T22: S (0)\n          T23: S (0)\n          T24: S (0)  // wait one more turn\n          T25: U (1)  // now at T25: y=1\n          T26: U (2)\n          T27: U (3) -> dangerous at T27 (freeway3)\n\n        Still not.\n\n        We must be above freeway4 by T27? \n\n          T25: U (1->2)\n          T26: U (2->3)\n          T27: U (3->4) -> dangerous.\n\n        The only safe freeways at T27 are y=0,5,6,7,8,9. \n\n        How to be at y=5 at T27 from the bottom? \n          T25: y=1 -> to get to y=5 at T27: need 4 moves in 2 turns: impossible.\n\n        Therefore, the down-then-up approach seems to take more than 11 turns.\n\n        We return to the 11-action plan.\n\n        But note: in the 11-action plan, we are at y=4 for turns T21, T22, T23, T24 (four turns) and then move up.\n\n        Is there a way to do it in 10 actions? \n\n        How about we are at y=5 at T25, but we start moving up sooner? \n\n        We cannot because of the danger at T23 and T24 in freeways 5-8.\n\n        How about we go up to y=6 sooner and then drop to a safe freeway before T23? \n\n          T19: U (3)\n          T20: U (4)\n          T21: U (5) -> safe\n          T22: U (6) -> safe\n          T23: D (5) -> dangerous! because at T23, freeway5 is dangerous.\n\n        Or T23: down to y=5 is dangerous.\n\n        How about down to y=4? \n          T23: from y=6 to y=5 -> then at T23: y=5 -> dangerous.\n\n        We cannot avoid.\n\n        Therefore, the minimal H is 11.\n\n        Let me double-check the 11-action plan:\n\n          Turn 19: U  -> y=3 at T20 (safe, freeway3: safe)\n          Turn 20: U  -> y=4 at T21 (safe, freeway4: safe)\n          Turn 21: S  -> y=4 at T22 (safe)\n          Turn 22: S  -> y=4 at T23 (safe)\n          Turn 23: S  -> y=4 at T24 (safe)\n          Turn 24: U  -> y=5 at T25 (safe: freeway5 at T25: cars: \n                car1: [7+6*(25-19)=7+36=43, 18+36=54] -> safe\n                car2: [43+36=79, 54+36=90] -> safe\n                car3: [-35+36=1, -24+36=12] -> safe (0 not in [1,12])\n          Turn 25: U  -> y=6 at T26 (freeway6: safe at T26)\n          Turn 26: U  -> y=7 at T27 (freeway7: safe at T27 because danger only at T23,24)\n          Turn 27: U  -> y=8 at T28 (freeway8: safe at T28)\n          Turn 28: U  -> y=9 at T29\n\n        We are at y=9 at T29, which is after 10 actions? \n\n        But note: the actions are taken at turns 19 to 28 (inclusive) -> 10 actions? \n        However, we have 10 actions but the states go from T19 (start at y=2) to T29 (y=9). \n\n        The problem: \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" \n\n        Here, t1 = 19. \n        We are outputting actions for t = 0 to H-1 relative to t1, so the actions are for turns 19, 20, ... 19+H-1.\n\n        And after H actions, we are at turn 19+H, and at that turn we are at y=9? \n\n        But in our plan, after 10 actions (H=10), we are at turn 19+10 = 29, and at y=9 -> correct.\n\n        However, we have 11 actions? Let's count:\n\n          Action at turn19: first action -> t=0\n          turn20: t=1\n          turn21: t=2\n          turn22: t=3\n          turn23: t=4\n          turn24: t=5\n          turn25: t=6\n          turn26: t=7\n          turn27: t=8\n          turn28: t=9\n\n        So H=10 actions.\n\n        But earlier I said 11 actions because I counted the turns from 19 to 29 as 11, but the actions are only 10.\n\n        The state at the beginning of turn19: y=2.\n        After action at turn19: state at turn20: y=3.\n        ...\n        After action at turn28: state at turn29: y=9.\n\n        So indeed 10 actions.\n\n        But wait, in the 11-action plan I described above, I had actions from turn19 to turn28 -> 10 actions.\n\n        And the plan is safe.\n\n        However, we had a miscalculation earlier: in the 11-action plan I said we wait at y=4 for turns T21, T22, T23, T24: that's four turns? \n          Actions: \n            T21: S -> so at the beginning of T21 we are at y=4, then we do S and at T22 we are at y=4.\n            T22: S -> at T23: y=4.\n            T23: S -> at T24: y=4.\n            T24: U -> at T25: y=5.\n\n          So we did three S actions at T21, T22, T23? \n\n          The actions are:\n            T19: U\n            T20: U\n            T21: S\n            T22: S\n            T23: S   // three S's\n            T24: U\n            T25: U\n            T26: U\n            T27: U\n            T28: U\n\n          That's 10 actions.\n\n        And the states:\n\n          T19: start y=2\n          T19: action U -> T20: y=3\n          T20: action U -> T21: y=4\n          T21: action S -> T22: y=4\n          T22: action S -> T23: y=4\n          T23: action S -> T24: y=4\n          T24: action U -> T25: y=5\n          T25: action U -> T26: y=6\n          T26: action U -> T27: y=7\n          T27: action U -> T28: y=8\n          T28: action U -> T29: y=9\n\n        So it is 10 actions.\n\n        But then why did I say 11? I think I miscounted the number of actions.\n\n        Therefore, the minimal H is 10.\n\n        However, we must re-check the collision at freeway5 at T25? \n          We are at freeway5 at T25: \n            The third car: at T25: \n                span = [ -35 + 6*(25-19) = -35 + 36 = 1, -24+36=12] -> [1,12] -> 0 is not in [1,12] -> safe.\n\n        And at T24 we are at y=4: freeway4 -> cars: \n            (18,7): [7+6*(24-19)=7+30=37, 18+30=48] -> safe.\n            (-48,-59): [-59+30=-29, -48+30=-18] -> safe.\n            But freeway4 only has two cars? the table says for freeway4: two cars: (18,7) and (-48,-59). \n\n        So safe.\n\n        And at T27: freeway7: cars:\n            (18,7): [7+6*(27-19)=7+48=55, 18+48=66] -> safe.\n            (54,43): [43+48=91, 54+48=102] -> safe.\n            (-24,-35): [-35+48=13, -24+48=24] -> safe.\n\n        So the plan is safe.\n\n        But note: at turn24, we are at freeway4: and there is a car at freeway4 that might be covering 0? \n          The cars on freeway4: \n            car1: (18,7,right,6) -> at T24: [7+6*5=37, 18+30=48] -> safe.\n            car2: (-48,-59,right,6) -> at T24: [-59+30=-29, -48+30=-18] -> safe.\n\n        And freeway4 is not dangerous at T24? only freeways 5,6,7,8 are dangerous at T23,24.\n\n        Therefore, we output:\n\n          Turn 19: U\n          Turn 20: U\n          Turn 21: S\n          Turn 22: S\n          Turn 23: S\n          Turn 24: U\n          Turn 25: U\n          Turn 26: U\n          Turn 27: U\n          Turn 28: U\n\n        But wait, we have 10 actions, but the last action at turn28 should move us from y=8 to y=9.\n\n        This is correct.\n\n        However, we must ensure we don't collide with any car on freeway8 at T28? \n          freeway8: cars at T28: \n            (18,7): [7+6*(28-19)=7+54=61, 18+54=72] -> safe.\n            (54,43): [43+54=97, 54+54=108] -> safe.\n            (-24,-35): [-35+54=19, -24+54=30] -> safe.\n\n        So safe.\n\n        And at T27 on freeway7: safe as above.\n\n        Therefore, the answer is 10 actions.\n\n        But is there a plan with 9 actions? \n          We need to reach y=9 in 9 actions: \n            T19: action -> T20: state\n            ...\n            T27: action -> T28: state y=9.\n\n          The net movement: from y=2 to y=9: 7 up moves.

The cars on each freeway move right at 6 units per turn, and collisions occur if the player is on a freeway (y=1 to 8) at a turn when any car on that freeway spans x=0. The dangerous periods are:\n- Freeways 1-4: dangerous at turns 27 and 28.\n- Freeways 5-8: dangerous at turns 23 and 24.\n\nThe player starts at turn 19 at y=2. The minimal sequence of 10 actions ensures the player avoids all dangerous freeways at critical turns:\n- At turns 23 and 24, the player stays at y=4 (freeway 4, safe as freeways 5-8 are dangerous, but freeway 4 is safe at these turns).\n- At turn 25, moving to y=5 is safe as freeway 5 is no longer dangerous.\n- The player reaches y=9 at turn 29 after 10 actions.\n\nThe sequence is:\n\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{array}{c}\n\\text{Turn } 19: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 20: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 21: \\text{S} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 22: \\text{S} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 23: \\text{S} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 24: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 25: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 26: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 27: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 28: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\end{array}\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,3) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible without colliding with any cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t1=20, and I have to find a sequence of actions: U for up, D for down, or S for stay.\n\nFirst, I should understand how the cars move. According to the update rules, all cars are moving right with speed 6. For right-moving cars, the span at time T is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)], where t1 is the current turn, which is 20.\n\nLet me denote the initial state at t=20.\n\nFor each freeway, the cars are given. But looking at the table, freeways 1 to 4 have two cars each, and 5 to 8 have three cars each, but all with the same parameters? That seems odd, but I'll go with it.\n\nLet me list the cars for each freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: two cars: (h=24, τ=13, d=right, s=6) and (h=-42, τ=-53, d=right, s=6)\n\nSimilarly for freeways 2,3,4.\n\nFreeway 5: three cars: (24,13,right,6), (60,49,right,6), (-18,-29,right,6)\n\nSame for 6,7,8.\n\nNow, since all cars are moving right at speed 6, and the collision happens only if the player is on a freeway y at turn T and 0 is in the span of some car on that freeway at that turn.\n\nThe player position is updated first, I think, based on the action, and then we check for collision at the new position for that turn.\n\nThe note says: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nLet me read carefully.\n\nThe collision occurs at turn T only if the player is on freeway y_T and 0 is in the span of a car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nThe position at turn T is y_T. When we take action at turn T, it determines y_{T+1}.\n\nThe sequence is:\n\n- At turn t, player is at position y_t.\n\n- Player chooses action a_t: U, D, or S.\n\n- Then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with the constraint that y_{t+1} must be between 0 and 9.\n\n- Then, for collision at turn t+1: we need to check if at turn t+1, when player is at y_{t+1}, if y_{t+1} is between 1 and 8, then we check if 0 is in the span of any car on freeway y_{t+1} at time t+1.\n\nThe collision is defined for the turn when the player is on the freeway.\n\nLet me see the definition:\n\n\"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\ny_T is the player's y-position at turn T.\n\nAt turn T, player is at (0, y_T). If y_T is between 1 and 8, then we check the cars on that freeway at time T to see if 0 is in their span at time T.\n\nIf 0 is in the span, collision occurs.\n\nThe note clarifies the timing: when you move to a new row at turn T, you are not on that row until the next turn.\n\nSpecifically: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T\"\n\nTurn T: you are at y_T. You take action a_T, which moves you to y_{T+1} for turn T+1.\n\nSo at turn T, you are on y_T, and we check collision based on cars at time T for freeway y_T.\n\nAt turn T+1, you are on y_{T+1}, and we check based on cars at time T+1 for freeway y_{T+1}.\n\nThe note says: if at turn T, you move to a different row, say from y_T to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T, then at turn T, you are still on y_T, so only cars on y_T matter for collision at turn T. At turn T+1, you are on y_{T+1}, so cars on y_{T+1} matter.\n\nAnd for the row you're moving to, you are not on it until the next turn, so if a car is passing 0 at time T on y_{T+1}, but you are not there yet, no collision. Similarly, if you leave a row, and a car comes at time T+1, but you're gone, no collision.\n\nIn this case, since we're moving vertically, and cars are horizontal, the key point is that we only care about the row we're on at that exact turn.\n\nNow, back to the cars.\n\nAll cars are moving right at speed 6. I need to find when 0 is occupied on each freeway for each turn.\n\nLet me define t as the turn number, with t=20 being current.\n\nFor a right-moving car with head h, tail τ at t=20, the span at time T is [τ + 6(T-20), h + 6(T-20)]\n\nSince it's moving right, the tail is on the left, head on the right, so span is [left, right] = [τ, h] at t=20, so at time T, it's [τ + 6(T-20), h + 6(T-20)]\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but here all are right-moving.\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 1: first car (24,13,right,6), so at t=20, span [13,24]? Head is 24, tail is 13, so since right-moving, tail is left end, head is right end, so span [13,24].\n\nThe notation says \"head h, tail τ\", and for right-moving, span is [τ, h], I think.\n\nLet me confirm: \"For car k on freeway i, suppose its head is at h, tail is at τ at turn t1, and speed s. Then for right-moving: Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\"\n\nYes, so for right-moving, at time t1, span is [τ, h], and it moves right, so at time T, [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but here all are right.\n\nNow, collision if 0 is in [τ + s(T-20), h + s(T-20)] for some car on the freeway at turn T.\n\n0 is the x-position where the player is, since player is always at x=0.\n\nPlayer is at (0, y_t), so x=0 always.\n\nSo for a given freeway k and turn T, we need to check if 0 is covered by any car on freeway k at time T.\n\nThat is, for some car, τ + 6(T-20) ≤ 0 ≤ h + 6(T-20)\n\nOr equivalently, 0 is between the left and right ends of the car at time T.\n\nNow, since the car spans might have gaps, we need to check all cars on that row.\n\nBut in this case, for each freeway, multiple cars.\n\nFirst, let's list all the cars for each freeway at t=20.\n\nFreeway 1: two cars:\n\nCar A: h=24, τ=13, so span at t=20: [13,24]\n\nCar B: h=-42, τ=-53, span at t=20: [-53,-42]\n\nSimilarly for freeways 2,3,4: same as freeway 1.\n\nFreeway 5: three cars:\n\nCar A: (24,13,right,6) → [13,24]\n\nCar B: (60,49,right,6) → [49,60]\n\nCar C: (-18,-29,right,6) → [-29,-18]\n\nSimilarly for freeways 6,7,8.\n\nNow, for a given freeway and time T, we need to see if 0 is in any of the spans.\n\nSince the player starts at y=3 and needs to go to y=9, which is above, so we probably want to go up as much as possible, but need to avoid collisions on the rows.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nThe goal is to reach (0,9), and since we're at (0,3), we need to get to row 9.\n\nEach action changes y by +1, -1, or 0.\n\nMinimal number of turns: since we need to go from 3 to 9, that's 6 steps up, but we can move down or stay, so H could be more than 6 if we need to avoid cars.\n\nBut we want minimal H, so probably go up as fast as possible, but avoid being on a row when a car is at x=0.\n\nNow, since we can stay or move down, we might need to wait sometimes.\n\nBut moving down might not help since we need to go up eventually, so probably better to stay or go up only, unless necessary to go down to avoid.\n\nBut going down from row 3 might not be good since row 0 is safe, but it delays reaching row 9.\n\nSimilarly, staying also delays.\n\nSo for minimal turns, we should only go up or stay, not down, I think.\n\nUnless going down helps to avoid a collision and save time overall, but that seems unlikely since we have to make net +6 in y.\n\nEach down or stay adds an extra turn without progress, so to minimize turns, we should avoid down and minimize stay.\n\nIdeally, go up every turn, but if on some row at some time, there is a car at x=0, we need to avoid being there at that time.\n\nSo we need to check for each row, when it is safe to be on it, i.e., when no car covers x=0.\n\nThen we can plan a path from row 3 to row 9 in time, moving up when possible.\n\nSince we start at turn 20, row 3.\n\nWe need to reach row 9 at some turn, say T, with y_T = 9.\n\nAnd for each turn between, when we are on a row between 1 and 8, it must be safe at that turn.\n\nNow, first, let's find for each freeway row k=1 to 8, for each time T, whether x=0 is occupied by a car.\n\nTime T is turn number, starting from t=20.\n\nLet me define τ = T - 20, the offset from current turn.\n\nSo for time τ, which is turns after now.\n\nτ=0 is current turn t=20.\n\nAt τ=0, t=20.\n\nFor a car, at time τ, position: left end: τ_left(τ) = τ + 6τ\n\ns=6, t1=20, so at time T=20+τ, left end = τ + 6τ, where τ is the tail at t=20? Let's use different variable.\n\nSet δ = T - 20, so at time δ (from now), for a car with tail τ at t=20, left end at time δ is τ + 6δ\n\nRight end is h + 6δ\n\n0 is covered if left_end <= 0 <= right_end, i.e., τ + 6δ <= 0 <= h + 6δ\n\nSince all cars on a row, we need for each row, the set of δ where 0 is covered by any car on that row.\n\nThen, the row is unsafe at time δ if covered, safe if not covered.\n\nFor the player, at time δ, if on row k, and k between 1 and 8, it must be safe, i.e., not covered.\n\nNow, let's compute for each row the unsafe times.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: k=1\n\nCars: car A: τ=13, h=24\n\ncar B: τ=-53, h=-42\n\nAt time δ, car A: left = 13 + 6δ, right = 24 + 6δ\n\n0 covered if 13 + 6δ <= 0 <= 24 + 6δ\n\nSince 13+6δ <=0 and 0<=24+6δ\n\n13+6δ <=0 => 6δ <= -13 => δ <= -13/6 ≈ -2.166, since δ is integer, δ <= -3? δ >=0 since we start from δ=0.\n\nδ = T-20, T>=20, so δ >=0.\n\nSo 13 + 6δ >=13 >0 for δ>=0, so 13+6δ >0, thus 13+6δ <=0 is false for all δ>=0.\n\nSimilarly, 0 <= 24+6δ is always true for δ>=0.\n\nBut for car A, 13+6δ <=0 <=24+6δ requires 13+6δ <=0, which is never for δ>=0, so car A never covers 0 for δ>=0.\n\nNow car B: τ=-53, h=-42\n\nleft = -53 + 6δ, right = -42 + 6δ\n\n0 covered if -53 + 6δ <= 0 <= -42 + 6δ\n\nWhich is -53 + 6δ <=0 and 0 <= -42 + 6δ\n\nFirst: -53 + 6δ <=0 => 6δ <=53 => δ <= 53/6 ≈ 8.833, so δ <=8 since integer\n\nSecond: 0 <= -42 + 6δ => 42 <= 6δ => δ >= 42/6 =7\n\nSo for car B, 0 covered when 7 <= δ <=8\n\nδ >=7 and δ <=8\n\nNow for freeway 1, only cars A and B, car A never covers, car B covers when δ=7 or 8.\n\nSo freeway 1 is unsafe at δ=7 and δ=8.\n\nSafe otherwise for δ>=0.\n\nδ=7: t=27, δ=8: t=28\n\nNow freeway 2: same as freeway 1, cars identical, so same unsafe times: δ=7,8\n\nSimilarly freeway 3: same, δ=7,8 unsafe\n\nFreeway 4: same, δ=7,8 unsafe\n\nNow freeway 5: k=5\n\nCars: A: (24,13,right,6) → same as before, τ=13,h=24, never covers 0 for δ>=0\n\nB: (60,49,right,6) → τ=49, h=60\n\nleft =49 +6δ, right=60+6δ\n\n49+6δ <=0? 49+6δ >0 for δ>=0, never <=0, so never covers 0.\n\nC: (-18,-29,right,6) → τ=-29, h=-18\n\nleft = -29 +6δ, right = -18 +6δ\n\n0 covered if -29 +6δ <=0 <= -18 +6δ\n\nWhich is -29 +6δ <=0 and 0 <= -18 +6δ\n\nFirst: -29 +6δ <=0 => 6δ <=29 => δ <=29/6≈4.833, δ<=4\n\nSecond: 0 <= -18 +6δ => 18 <=6δ => δ >=3\n\nSo δ >=3 and δ<=4, so δ=3,4\n\nThus for freeway 5, unsafe at δ=3 and δ=4.\n\nCars A and B never cover, only C covers at δ=3,4.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6: same as 5, unsafe at δ=3,4\n\nFreeway 7: same, unsafe δ=3,4\n\nFreeway 8: same, unsafe δ=3,4\n\nFreeway 8 has three cars same as 5,6,7.\n\nFreeway 5,6,7,8 all have the same cars: A,B,C as above, so all unsafe at δ=3,4.\n\nNow, rows 1-4: unsafe at δ=7,8\n\nRows 5-8: unsafe at δ=3,4\n\nδ is time offset from now, t=20+δ\n\nPlayer starts at δ=0, y=3.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at some δ=H-1, since we start action at δ=0 for turn t=20, and after H actions, at turn t=20+H, we are at position after H actions.\n\nLet's clarify the timing.\n\nAt turn t=20, player is at y=3.\n\nWe choose action a_{20} for turn 20.\n\nAfter action, at turn 21, y_{21} = y_20 + Δy, depending on a_{20}.\n\nThen at turn 21, we are at y_{21}, and so on.\n\nAfter H actions, we have done actions from t=20 to t=20+H-1, and at turn t=20+H, we are at y_{20+H}.\n\nWe want y_{20+H} = 9.\n\nAnd for each turn from t=20 to t=20+H-1, when we are at y_t, if y_t between 1 and 8, it must be safe at that turn.\n\nt from 20 to 20+H-1.\n\nIn terms of δ, let δ be such that turn t = 20 + δ, for δ from 0 to H-1 for the turns we are acting and being at positions.\n\nAt turn t=20+δ, for δ=0,1,2,..., we are at position y_{20+δ}\n\nAnd we choose action a_{20+δ} which determines y_{20+δ+1}\n\nBut the collision is checked at each turn based on y_{20+δ} and the cars at time t=20+δ.\n\nWe want for some H, after H actions, at turn t=20+H, y_{20+H} =9.\n\nAnd for each δ from 0 to H-1, at turn t=20+δ, if y_{20+δ} ∈ {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}, then it must be safe, i.e., no car at x=0 on that row at time t=20+δ.\n\nAt δ=0, t=20, we are at y=3, which is row 3, between 1 and 8, so we need it safe at t=20.\n\nSimilarly for other turns until we reach y=9.\n\nNow, at t=20, δ=0, for row 3: row 3 is one of freeways 1-4, which are unsafe at δ=7,8 but at δ=0, is it safe?\n\nFor rows 1-4, unsafe only at δ=7,8, so at δ=0, it is safe.\n\nSimilarly, rows 5-8 unsafe at δ=3,4, so at δ=0, they are safe except possibly at unsafe times.\n\nδ=0 for all rows: let's check.\n\nAt δ=0, t=20.\n\nFor row 1: unsafe at δ=7,8, so at δ=0, safe.\n\nRow 2: same, safe.\n\nRow 3: same, safe.\n\nRow 4: same, safe.\n\nRow 5: unsafe at δ=3,4, at δ=0, safe.\n\nSimilarly row 6,7,8 at δ=0 safe.\n\nSo all rows safe at δ=0.\n\nPlayer at y=3, safe.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\ny=9 is the goal, and it's not a freeway, so no cars, always safe.\n\nNow, the path: we start at y=3, δ=0.\n\nWe can take actions U, D, S.\n\nTo minimize H, we want to go up as much as possible.\n\nBut we need to avoid being on rows 1-4 at δ=7 or 8, and avoid being on rows 5-8 at δ=3 or 4.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- If on row k=1,2,3,4 at time δ=7 or δ=8, unsafe.\n\n- If on row k=5,6,7,8 at time δ=3 or δ=4, unsafe.\n\nNow, rows 5-8 unsafe at δ=3,4, which are earlier times.\n\nδ=3: t=23, δ=4: t=24\n\nδ=7: t=27, δ=8: t=28\n\nWe start at δ=0, y=3.\n\ny=3 is row 3, which is one of 1-4, so we need to not be on rows 1-4 at δ=7,8.\n\nSimilarly, not on rows 5-8 at δ=3,4.\n\nNow, since we are at y=3 at δ=0, and we need to get to y=9.\n\nThe minimal time: if we go up every turn, from y=3 to y=9 in 6 moves: after 6 ups, at turn t=20+6=26, y=9.\n\nNow, let's see the positions during.\n\nAt each turn δ from 0 to 5, we are at y_{20+δ}, and we move to y_{20+δ+1} after action.\n\nSequence:\n\nAt δ=0, t=20, y=3\n\nAfter a_{20}, at t=21, y_{21} = y_20 + Δy\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSuppose we always go up: actions U,U,U,U,U,U\n\nThen:\n\nAfter action at t=20: to y=4 at t=21\n\nAfter action at t=21: to y=5 at t=22\n\nAfter action at t=22: to y=6 at t=23\n\nAfter action at t=23: to y=7 at t=24\n\nAfter action at t=24: to y=8 at t=25\n\nAfter action at t=25: to y=9 at t=26\n\nNow, at each turn, when we are on a row between 1 and 8:\n\n- At t=20, δ=0, y=3, row 3, which is safe as above.\n\n- At t=21, δ=1, y=4, row 4, which is row 1-4, unsafe only at δ=7,8, δ=1<7, safe.\n\n- At t=22, δ=2, y=5, row 5, which is row 5-8, unsafe at δ=3,4; δ=2 <3, so safe? δ=2, not 3 or 4, so safe.\n\nUnsafe only at δ=3,4 for rows 5-8, so at δ=2, safe.\n\n- At t=23, δ=3, y=6, row 6, which is row 5-8, and δ=3, which is unsafe time! Because rows 5-8 unsafe at δ=3.\n\nSo at t=23, y=6, row 6, δ=3, unsafe, collision.\n\nProblem.\n\nSimilarly, if we continue, at t=24, δ=4, y=7, row 7, δ=4, unsafe for rows 5-8.\n\nt=25, δ=5, y=8, row 8, δ=5>4, safe? δ=5 not 3 or 4, so safe for rows 5-8.\n\nBut at t=23 and t=24, collision.\n\nSo we need to avoid being on rows 5-8 at δ=3 and δ=4.\n\nSimilarly, we need to avoid rows 1-4 at δ=7,8.\n\nIn the direct path, we are on row 5 at t=22? Let's list the turns and positions.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t.\n\nt=20: y=3\n\nAfter action a_t, y_{t+1} is set.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\n- t=20: position y=3\n\n- Take action a_{20}, say U, then y_{21} = 4\n\n- t=21: position y=4\n\n- Take action a_{21}, say U, then y_{22} = 5\n\n- t=22: position y=5\n\n- Take action a_{22}, say U, then y_{23} = 6\n\n- t=23: position y=6\n\n- Take action a_{23}, say U, then y_{24} = 7\n\n- t=24: position y=7\n\n- Take action a_{24}, say U, then y_{25} = 8\n\n- t=25: position y=8\n\n- Take action a_{25}, say U, then y_{26} = 9\n\n- t=26: position y=9, done.\n\nNow, collision checks:\n\n- At t=20: y=3, row 3, δ=0, safe\n\n- At t=21: y=4, row 4, δ=1, safe\n\n- At t=22: y=5, row 5, δ=2, safe (δ=2 not 3 or 4)\n\n- At t=23: y=6, row 6, δ=3, unsafe! Because rows 5-8 unsafe at δ=3\n\n- At t=24: y=7, row 7, δ=4, unsafe for rows 5-8\n\n- At t=25: y=8, row 8, δ=5, safe (δ=5 not 3 or 4)\n\nBut collisions at t=23 and t=24.\n\nSo we need to not be on rows 5-8 at t=23 and t=24, i.e., δ=3 and δ=4.\n\nt=23 is δ=3, t=24 is δ=4.\n\nSimilarly, we need to not be on rows 1-4 at t=27 and t=28, but since we are going up fast, we might not be there at those times if we avoid the early issue.\n\nIn this case, to avoid collision, we cannot be on rows 5,6,7,8 at t=23 and t=24.\n\nt=23 is δ=3, t=24 is δ=4.\n\nNow, at t=22, we are at y=5 if we go up, but y=5 is row 5, which is unsafe at t=23? At t=22, position y=5, which is at δ=2, which is safe, but at t=23, after moving to y=6.\n\nThe issue is at t=23 and t=24.\n\nSo for t=23 (δ=3) and t=24 (δ=4), we need y_t not in {5,6,7,8}, or if we are, it must not be a freeway row, but 5-8 are freeways.\n\ny_t must not be between 5 and 8 inclusive at t=23 and t=24.\n\nSimilarly, for t=27 and t=28, not on 1-4.\n\nBut since we are starting from low and going up, we can reach y=9 before t=27, so rows 1-4 at late times might not be an issue.\n\nFirst, let's handle the immediate problem.\n\nWe need to avoid being on rows 5-8 at δ=3 and δ=4, i.e., t=23 and t=24.\n\nOptions:\n\n1. Be on a row below 5 or above 8 at those times.\n\nBelow 5: rows 0,1,2,3,4 but rows 1-4 are safe at δ=3,4? Rows 1-4 are unsafe only at δ=7,8, so at δ=3,4, they are safe.\n\nSimilarly, row 0 and row 9 are safe always.\n\nSo at t=23 and t=24, we can be on rows 0,1,2,3,4 or 9.\n\nBut since we start from y=3 and need to go to y=9, we can be on lower rows.\n\nSpecifically, we can delay moving up to rows 5-8 until after t=24.\n\nt=24 is δ=4.\n\nAfter t=24, δ=5 and above, rows 5-8 are safe.\n\nSimilarly, we need to reach y=9.\n\nMinimal H: if we can stay low until after t=24, then go up.\n\nt=24 is turn 24, which is δ=4.\n\nWe start at t=20.\n\nAt t=20: y=3\n\nWe can stay on row 3 or move down to 2,1,0 or up to 4.\n\nBut if we stay low, we need to go up later.\n\nFor example, to avoid being on rows 5-8 at t=23 and t=24, we can be on row 4 or below at t=23 and t=24.\n\nThen after t=24, we can go up to 5,6,7,8,9.\n\nNow, let's see the sequence.\n\nSuppose at t=20, we are at y=3.\n\nWe need to choose actions.\n\nOption: stay on row 3 for a few turns until after t=24.\n\nt=24 is turn 24.\n\nCurrent t=20 to t=24 is 5 turns? Turns: t=20,21,22,23,24.\n\nAt t=20: position, then actions affect next position.\n\nList the positions we want at each turn.\n\nWe want for t=23 and t=24, y_t <=4 or y_t=9.\n\nBut y_t=9 might not be reachable yet.\n\ny_t <=4, since rows 0,1,2,3,4 are safe at those times.\n\nSimilarly, at t=22, we can be on row 5, since at t=22, δ=2, which is safe for row 5.\n\nδ=2 not 3 or 4.\n\nNow, let's plan from start.\n\nAt t=20: y=3, safe.\n\nNow, we can take action: if we go up, to y=4 at t=21.\n\nIf we stay, y=3 at t=21.\n\nIf down, to y=2 at t=21.\n\nBut going down might not help, so probably stay or up.\n\nSimilarly, to minimize time, we should go up when possible, but avoid the unsafe times.\n\nSince rows 5-8 are unsafe only at t=23 and t=24, we can be on row 4 at t=23 and t=24, then go up after.\n\nRow 4 is safe at all times except t=27,28, but we can be there before.\n\nt=23 and t=24 are δ=3,4, row 4 is safe since unsafe only δ=7,8.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo, for example:\n\nAt t=20: y=3\n\nTake action S (stay), then at t=21, y=3\n\nTake action S, at t=22, y=3? But we need to move eventually.\n\nBut let's see the times.\n\nt=20: y=3\n\nt=21: we can be y=3 or y=4 or y=2, etc.\n\nWe need to not be on 5-8 at t=23 and t=24.\n\nSo at t=23, y must be <=4 or >=9, but 9 not possible yet.\n\nSimilarly t=24.\n\nNow, at t=22: if we are on y=5, it is safe since δ=2 for t=22.\n\nt=22 is δ=2.\n\nThen at t=23, if we go up to y=6, unsafe.\n\nSo to avoid, at t=22, we should not be on y=5 if we plan to go up, but we can be on lower.\n\nSet positions.\n\nSuppose we stay at y=3 for some turns.\n\nAt t=20: y=3\n\nAction S: at t=21, y=3\n\nAction S: at t=22, y=3\n\nNow at t=22, y=3, safe.\n\nThen action: if we go up to y=4 at t=23? Action at t=22: U, then at t=23, y=4\n\nAt t=23, y=4, which is row 4, safe since δ=3, and row 4 unsafe only at δ=7,8.\n\nThen at t=23, we are at y=4.\n\nAction: if U, to y=5 at t=24.\n\nAt t=24, y=5, row 5, δ=4, which is unsafe for rows 5-8.\n\nProblem.\n\nIf at t=23, action S, stay at y=4, then at t=24, y=4, safe.\n\nThen after, we can go up.\n\nBut at t=24, y=4, safe.\n\nThen action at t=24: U, to y=5 at t=25\n\nt=25 is δ=5, which is safe for rows 5-8.\n\nSimilarly, then we can go up to y=6 at t=26, y=7 at t=27, y=8 at t=28, y=9 at t=29.\n\nBut at t=27 and t=28, rows 1-4 are unsafe, but we are on higher rows.\n\nt=27: δ=7, rows 1-4 unsafe.\n\nBut at t=27, if we are at y=6, row 6, which is not 1-4, so safe.\n\nSimilarly t=28, y=7 or whatever.\n\nIn this sequence:\n\n- t=20: y=3, action S? Let's list actions and positions.\n\nStart: t=20, position y=3\n\nAction a_20: S (stay), so y_{21} = 3\n\nt=21: position y=3\n\nAction a_21: S (stay), y_{22} = 3\n\nt=22: position y=3\n\nAction a_22: U (up), y_{23} = 4\n\nt=23: position y=4\n\nAction a_23: S (stay), y_{24} = 4  (since stay)\n\nt=24: position y=4\n\nAction a_24: U (up), y_{25} = 5\n\nt=25: position y=5\n\nAction a_25: U (up), y_{26} = 6\n\nt=26: position y=6\n\nAction a_26: U (up), y_{27} = 7\n\nt=27: position y=7\n\nAction a_27: U (up), y_{28} = 8\n\nt=28: position y=8\n\nAction a_28: U (up), y_{29} = 9\n\nt=29: position y=9, done.\n\nNow, check collisions:\n\nt=20: y=3, δ=0, safe\n\nt=21: y=3, δ=1, safe\n\nt=22: y=3, δ=2, safe\n\nt=23: y=4, δ=3, row 4 safe (not unsafe time)\n\nt=24: y=4, δ=4, row 4 safe\n\nt=25: y=5, δ=5, row 5-8 safe at δ=5\n\nt=26: y=6, δ=6, safe\n\nt=27: y=7, δ=7, row 7 is 5-8, but unsafe at δ=3,4, δ=7>4, safe. Rows 5-8 unsafe only δ=3,4, so at δ=7, safe.\n\nSimilarly t=28: y=8, δ=8, safe for rows 5-8.\n\nThen t=29: y=9, safe.\n\nNo collisions.\n\nH = number of actions: from t=20 to t=28, actions a20 to a28, 9 actions? Let's count.\n\nActions: at t=20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28: that's 9 actions.\n\nAfter 9 actions, at t=29, y=9.\n\nBut we started at t=20, after 0 actions, position at t=20.\n\nAfter 1 action (a20), position at t=21.\n\n...\n\nAfter H actions, position at t=20+H.\n\nWe want position at t=20+H to be 9.\n\nHere at t=29, y=9, so 20+H=29, H=9.\n\nBut is this minimal? We used two stays at the beginning and one stay at t=23, so we have extra turns.\n\nMinimal possible: we need at least 6 moves up, but with delays.\n\nIn the direct path, we had collision at t=23 and t=24.\n\nWe need to avoid being on rows 5-8 at t=23 and t=24.\n\nIn the above, we were on row 4 at those times.\n\nBut we used three extra turns: two stays and one extra up or something.\n\nFrom y=3 to y=9, minimal 6 moves up.\n\nBut we need to spend time not on rows 5-8 at t=23,24.\n\nt=23 and t=24 are specific times.\n\nAt t=22, we can be on row 4 or 5, but if on row 5, we cannot go up to 6 at t=23.\n\nBut at t=22, if we are on row 4, we can go to row 5 at t=23? No.\n\nAt t=22, position y, after action, to y_{23}.\n\nIf at t=22, y=4, then action U, to y=5 at t=23.\n\nBut at t=23, y=5, which is unsafe if δ=3.\n\nIf we stay at y=4 at t=22, then at t=23 y=4.\n\nTo be on row 5 at t=23, we must have been on row 4 or 5 or 6 at t=22 and action S or D or U to stay or move to 5.\n\nBut if we go to row 5 at t=23, it is unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, we cannot be on row 5 at t=23.\n\nSimilarly for 6,7,8.\n\nSo we must not be on rows 5-8 at t=23 and t=24.\n\nTherefore, at t=23, y must be <=4 or 9, but 9 impossible.\n\nSimilarly t=24, y<=4 or 9.\n\nSo y=0,1,2,3,4 at t=23 and t=24.\n\nNow, we start at y=3 at t=20.\n\nTo reach y=4 or less at t=23 and t=24.\n\nt=23 is three turns from now.\n\nFrom t=20 to t=23, we have actions at t=20,21,22 affecting positions at t=21,22,23.\n\nAt t=20: position y=3\n\nAfter a20, y21\n\nAfter a21, y22\n\nAfter a22, y23\n\nSimilarly, after a23, y24, etc.\n\nWe need y23 <=4 and y24 <=4.\n\nSince y changes by at most 1 per turn, y23 can be from 2 to 4, say.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, to minimize time, we should not go down, so we can stay or go up slowly.\n\nFor example:\n\nTo have y23 <=4 and y24 <=4.\n\nSince we start at y=3, we can go up to y=4 and stay there, or stay at 3.\n\nBut we need to go to 9 later.\n\nNow, the earliest we can be on row 5 or above after t=24.\n\nt=24 is δ=4.\n\nAfter t=24, at t=25, we can be on row 5, which is safe.\n\nThen from there, go up to 9.\n\nNow, from y=4 at t=24 to y=9, it takes 5 actions: to go to 5,6,7,8,9.\n\nAfter action at t=24, to y=5 at t=25\n\n...\n\nAfter action at t=28, to y=9 at t=29.\n\nSame as before.\n\nBut we can start going up earlier.\n\nFor example, at t=20: action U, to y=4 at t=21\n\nThen at t=21: action S, to y=4 at t=22? Action S means stay, so y_{t+1} = y_t.\n\nAt t=21, position y=4, action S, then y22=4\n\nThen at t=22, position y=4, action S, then y23=4\n\nAt t=23, position y=4, action S, then y24=4\n\nThen at t=24, position y=4, action U, to y=5 at t=25\n\nThen U at t=25 to y=6 at t=26\n\nU at t=26 to y=7 at t=27\n\nU at t=27 to y=8 at t=28\n\nU at t=28 to y=9 at t=29\n\nNow, positions:\n\nt=20: y=3, safe\n\na20: U → t=21: y=4\n\nt=21: y=4, safe (δ=1)\n\na21: S → t=22: y=4\n\nt=22: y=4, safe (δ=2)\n\na22: S → t=23: y=4\n\nt=23: y=4, safe (δ=3)\n\na23: S → t=24: y=4\n\nt=24: y=4, safe (δ=4)\n\na24: U → t=25: y=5, safe (δ=5)\n\na25: U → t=26: y=6, safe (δ=6)\n\na26: U → t=27: y=7, safe (δ=7)\n\na27: U → t=28: y=8, safe (δ=8)\n\na28: U → t=29: y=9\n\nH=9 actions, to t=29.\n\nBut we have stays at t=21,22,23, so three stays.\n\nIn the first sequence, I had stays at t=20,21 and then at t=23? Earlier sequence had a20:S, a21:S, a22:U, a23:S, a24:U, etc.\n\nIn that, from t=21 to t=22: stayed at y=3, then to y=4 at t=23.\n\nBut here from t=21 to t=24: at y=4, with stays.\n\nBut still H=9.\n\nCan we reduce?\n\nSuppose we go up faster but avoid being on 5-8 at t=23,24.\n\nFor example, at t=20: U to y=4 at t=21\n\nt=21: y=4\n\nNow, if we go up at t=21: U to y=5 at t=22\n\nt=22: y=5, which is safe at δ=2\n\nBut then at t=22, if we stay or go up, to y=5 or y=6 at t=23, which is unsafe.\n\nIf we go down? But that might not help.\n\nAt t=22, position y=5, action D, to y=4 at t=23.\n\nThen at t=23: y=4, safe.\n\nThen at t=23, action: if U to y=5 at t=24, but at t=24, y=5, δ=4, unsafe.\n\nProblem.\n\nIf at t=23, action S, stay y=4, then t=24 y=4, safe.\n\nThen at t=24, action U to y=5 at t=25, safe.\n\nThen go up.\n\nSequence:\n\nt=20: y=3, a20: U → t=21: y=4\n\nt=21: y=4, a21: U → t=22: y=5  (safe, δ=2)\n\nt=22: y=5, a22: D → t=23: y=4  (down to 4)\n\nt=23: y=4, a23: S → t=24: y=4  (stay)\n\nt=24: y=4, a24: U → t=25: y=5\n\nt=25: y=5, a25: U → t=26: y=6\n\nt=26: y=6, a26: U → t=27: y=7\n\nt=27: y=7, a27: U → t=28: y=8\n\nt=28: y=8, a28: U → t=29: y=9\n\nStill to t=29, and we have a down action, which is worse, and same H=9.\n\nBut we reached y=9 at t=29 same.\n\nH=9.\n\nBut with a down, it might be slower, but time same.\n\nNow, to save time, we need to be on row 5 earlier or later, but with the constraint.\n\nAnother idea: go up to row 4 and stay until after t=24, but we can go to row 5 at t=25.\n\nBut from t=20 to t=24, we can be at y=4.\n\nAt t=24, y=4, then go up.\n\nBut to go from y=4 to y=9, need 5 ups, from t=24 to t=29.\n\nIf we can be at higher row before, but we cannot because of unsafe times.\n\nAt t=22, we can be at y=5, but we have to go down or stay to avoid t=23 on row 5.\n\nBut that costs an extra action.\n\nSuppose we go up directly but skip the unsafe rows at unsafe times.\n\nFor example, at t=22: be at y=4, then at t=23: go to y=5? But at t=23, if y=5, unsafe.\n\nCannot.\n\nBe at y=3 at t=22, then at t=23 go to y=4, then at t=24 go to y=5? At t=24, y=5 unsafe.\n\nStill problem.\n\nThe only way to not be on 5-8 at t=23,24 is to be on <=4 at those times.\n\nThen the fastest is to be at y=4 at t=23 and t=24, for example.\n\nFrom start, at t=20: y=3, go up to y=4 at t=21.\n\nThen stay at y=4 from t=21 to t=24, with stays.\n\nThen at t=24, y=4, go up to y=5 at t=25, etc., to y=9 at t=29.\n\nBut we can reduce the stays if we start lower.\n\nAt t=20: y=3, stay at y=3 for one turn: a20:S, t=21:y=3\n\nThen a21:U, t=22:y=4\n\nThen a22:S, t=23:y=4\n\na23:S, t=24:y=4\n\na24:U, t=25:y=5\n\na25:U, t=26:y=6\n\na26:U, t=27:y=7\n\na27:U, t=28:y=8\n\na28:U, t=29:y=9\n\nSame as first sequence.\n\nH=9.\n\nBut is there a way to reach earlier?\n\nSuppose we go to row 5 at t=25, which is safe.\n\nTo be at y=5 at t=25.\n\nFrom y=3 at t=20, we need to reach y=5 in 5 steps? From t=20 to t=25, positions from y=3 to y=5, we can do it in fewer actions.\n\nFor example, a20:U, t=21:y=4\n\na21:U, t=22:y=5\n\nBut at t=22, y=5 is safe, but then we cannot stay at t=22 because if a22:S, t=23:y=5 unsafe; if a22:U, t=23:y=6 unsafe; if a22:D, t=23:y=4 safe, but then we are at y=4 at t=23.\n\nThen we can go to y=5 at t=24, but t=24 y=5 unsafe.\n\nSo we have to wait until t=25 to be on y=5.\n\nSimilarly, we can be at y=4 at t=24, then to y=5 at t=25.\n\nBut to be at y=4 at t=24, from y=3 at t=20.\n\nWe can reach y=4 quickly.\n\nFor example: a20:U, t=21:y=4\n\nThen stay until t=24: so a21:S, t=22:y=4; a22:S, t=23:y=4; a23:S, t=24:y=4; then a24:U, t=25:y=5.\n\nThen from y=5 to y=9: need 4 more ups, to t=29.\n\nt=25:y=5, a25:U, t=26:y=6; a26:U, t=27:y=7; a27:U, t=28:y=8; a28:U, t=29:y=9.\n\nStill t=29.\n\nIf we go up faster at the beginning, but we hit the unsafe zone.\n\nAnother idea: since row 4 is safe at all times except late, but we won't be there late, we can use row 4 as a waiting point.\n\nBut to minimize, we need to have less waiting.\n\nThe unsafe times are only two turns for rows 5-8, so we need to avoid those two turns on those rows.\n\nThe minimal delay is to have two extra turns, but in practice, with the position, we might need more.\n\nFrom y=3 to y=9, minimal 6 moves.\n\nBut we have to spend at least 2 turns not on rows 5-8 during t=23,24, but since we can be on lower rows, and we are already on row 3, we can be on row 3 or 4 at those times with no extra cost if we stay, but staying costs a turn without progress.\n\nFor example, if we stay at y=3 or y=4 during t=23 and t=24, that means we are not moving up, so we need additional turns to move up later.\n\nSpecifically, in the sequence, we have to have y_t <=4 for t=23 and t=24.\n\nThen at t=24, y=4, say.\n\nThen we need to go to y=9, which takes 5 actions: to increase by 5.\n\nFrom t=24 to t=29, 5 actions.\n\nt=24 position y=4, after action at t=24, to y=5 at t=25, ..., to y=9 at t=29.\n\nNow, from start to t=24, we have from t=20 to t=24, 5 turns to go from y=3 to y=4, which we can do with one up and stays, but we start at y=3 at t=20.\n\nTo have y=4 at t=24, we can do it with one up action and three stays, for example.\n\nBut the up action can be early.\n\nMinimal actions to be at y=4 at t=24: since y=3 at t=20, we need to increase y by 1 over 4 actions (from t=20 to t=24, actions at t=20,21,22,23 determine y at t=21,22,23,24).\n\ny_{24} depends on actions from t=20 to t=23.\n\nActions a20,a21,a22,a23 affect y21,y22,y23,y24.\n\nWe need y24=4.\n\nAnd for t=23, y23 <=4.\n\nBut since y23 <=4 and y24=4, it should be fine.\n\nTo have y24=4, with minimal actions, but we can have y increase slowly.\n\nFor example, a20:S, y21=3; a21:S, y22=3; a22:U, y23=4; a23:S, y24=4.\n\nThen at t=23, y=4, t=24, y=4.\n\nThen a24:U, y25=5, and so on to y29=9.\n\nH=9 actions.\n\na20:S, a21:S, a22:U, a23:S, a24:U, a25:U, a26:U, a27:U, a28:U.\n\n9 actions.\n\nIf we go up earlier: a20:U, y21=4; then a21:S, y22=4; a22:S, y23=4; a23:S, y24=4; same as before.\n\nStill need to stay at y=4 for three turns to cover t=22,23,24? In this case, at t=22: y=4, which is fine, but we don't need to be at y=4 until t=23,24.\n\nAt t=22, we can be at y=3 or 4 or 5, but if at y=5, we have to go down or stay to avoid unsafe, which costs.\n\nFor example, suppose at t=20: U to y=4 at t=21\n\nt=21: y=4, U to y=5 at t=22\n\nt=22: y=5, safe at δ=2\n\nThen to avoid t=23 on y=5 or higher, we must go down to y=4 at t=23: so a22:D, y23=4\n\nThen at t=23: y=4, safe\n\nThen to avoid t=24 on y=5, we can stay at y=4: a23:S, y24=4\n\nThen a24:U, y25=5, etc.\n\nSame as before, with a down action.\n\nStill to t=29.\n\nNo savings.\n\nThus, minimal H is 9, reaching at t=29.\n\nBut in the sequence, we have actions from t=20 to t=28, 9 actions.\n\nNow, about rows 1-4 at late times: in this plan, we are not on rows 1-4 at t=27,28, since we are on row 6,7,8 at those times, which are safe.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, one possible sequence is to stay at y=3 for two turns, then go to y=4 and stay, then go up.\n\nBut in the sequence I have.\n\nSince we need to be at y<=4 at t=23 and t=24, and at t=24 we can be at y=4, then go up.\n\nBut to reach y=4 at t=24 from y=3 at t=20, we can do with one up and the rest stay, but with multiple stays.\n\nWe can have different paths, but H=9 seems necessary.\n\nPerhaps go down to row 0, but that would take more turns, worse.\n\nSo H=9 is minimal.\n\nNow, for the sequence, let's write it clearly.\n\nTurn t_1 = 20.\n\nStart at (0,3)\n\nActions:\n\nTo have y=3 at t=20, t=21, then y=4 at t=22,23,24? Let's specify the actions for each turn.\n\nAt turn t, we choose action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nWe need the sequence of actions from t=20 onwards.\n\nFor position at t=24 to be 4, and at t=23 to be <=4.\n\nEarliest: let's have a sequence with minimal stays.\n\nFor example:\n\nAt t=20: action S (stay), so y_{21} = 3\n\nAt t=21: action S (stay), so y_{22} = 3\n\nAt t=22: action U (up), so y_{23} = 4\n\nAt t=23: action S (stay), so y_{24} = 4\n\nAt t=24: action U (up), so y_{25} = 5\n\nAt t=25: action U (up), so y_{26} = 6\n\nAt t=26: action U (up), so y_{27} = 7\n\nAt t=27: action U (up), so y_{28} = 8\n\nAt t=28: action U (up), so y_{29} = 9\n\nNow, positions:\n\nt=20: y=3\n\nt=21: y=3 (after a20)\n\nt=22: y=3 (after a21?

Number of actions: from t=20 to t=28, 9 actions.\n\nThe sequence is for t=20 to t=28.\n\nIn the answer, it should be actions from t=20 to t=20+H-1.\n\nHere H=9, actions from t=20 to t=28.\n\nReaches y=9 at t=29.\n\nTo write the answer.\n\nBut is there a sequence with H=8?\n\nSuppose H=8, then at t=28, y=9.\n\nSo actions from t=20 to t=27, 8 actions.\n\nAfter a27, at t=28, y=9.\n\nNow, y at t=28 must be 9.\n\nSince y starts at 3, after 8 actions, net change: each U +1, D -1, S 0, so to reach +6, we need at least 6 U, and at most 2 S or D, but D not useful.\n\nWith 6 U and 2 S, we can reach in 8 actions.\n\nFor example, start at y=3.\n\nAfter actions, y at t=28=9.\n\nNow, positions at intermediate turns.\n\nt=20: y=3\n\nWe need y at t=23 and t=24 <=4.\n\nt=23 is after 3 actions? Let's see.\n\nAt t=20: position\n\nAfter a20: y at t=21\n\nAfter a21: y at t=22\n\nAfter a22: y at t=23\n\nAfter a23: y at t=24\n\nAfter a24: y at t=25\n\nAfter a25: y at t=26\n\nAfter a26: y at t=27\n\nAfter a27: y at t=28=9\n\nWe need y at t=23 <=4 and y at t=24 <=4.\n\nAlso, y at t=28=9.\n\nSince y changes slowly, y at t=24 <=4, and y at t=28=9, so from t=24 to t=28, 4 actions, to increase from y<=4 to 9, which requires at least 5 increases, but only 4 actions, impossible.\n\ny at t=24 is after action a23, so at time t=24, position y_{24}.\n\nThen after actions a24,a25,a26,a27, we get to y_{28}.\n\nIn 4 actions, we can increase y by at most 4 (if all U), so from y_{24} <=4 to y_{28} <=8, but we need y_{28}=9, impossible.\n\ny_{28} <= y_{24} + 4 <= 4 + 4 = 8 < 9, cannot reach 9.\n\nTherefore, with y_{24} <=4, we cannot reach y_{28}=9 in 4 actions.\n\nThus, H=8 is impossible.\n\nSimilarly, for H=9, it works as above.\n\nThus minimal H is 9.\n\nNow, for the sequence, we can have different, but the one I have is fine.\n\nIn the sequence, we have two S at start, but we can have other.\n\nFor example, go up first then stay.\n\na20: U → y21=4\n\na21: S → y22=4\n\na22: S → y23=4\n\na23: S → y24=4\n\na24: U → y25=5\n\na25: U → y26=6\n\na26: U → y27=7\n\na27: U → y28=8\n\na28: U → y29=9\n\nSame H=9.\n\nIn this, actions: t=20: U, t=21: S, t=22: S, t=23: S, t=24: U, t=25: U, t=26: U, t=27: U, t=28: U.\n\nThen positions: t=20: y=3 (before any action, but position at turn)\n\nAt turn t=20: position y=3, then action a20=U\n\nAt turn t=21: position y=4, action a21=S\n\nt=22: y=4, action a22=S\n\nt=23: y=4, action a23=S\n\nt=24: y=4, action a24=U\n\nt=25: y=5, action a25=U\n\nt=26: y=6, action a26=U\n\nt=27: y=7, action a27=U\n\nt=28: y=8, action a28=U\n\nThen at t=29: y=9\n\nIn this, at t=28, y=8, and we reach y=9 at t=29.\n\nNow, in the sequence, for the answer, we need to output actions from t=20 to t=20+H-1, which is t=20 to t=28.\n\nNow, to write in the box.\n\nBut in the first sequence, I had S at t=20 and t=21, U at t=22, S at t=23, etc.\n\nBut it doesn't matter.\n\nNow, the car state is the same for all rows, but we have row 5-8 unsafe at δ=3,4, which we avoided.\n\nIn the output, we need the sequence.\n\nAlso, for the minimal H, it's 9.\n\nBut let's confirm if we can do with H=8 by not requiring y<=4 at t=24, but we must not be on 5-8 at t=24, so y<=4 or 9, but 9 not possible, so y<=4 at t=24.\n\nSimilarly, at t=23, y<=4.\n\nAnd from there, cannot reach y=9 in 4 actions, so H=9 is minimal.\n\nThus, the sequence.\n\nI'll use the first one I thought.\n\nAnswer:\n\nTurn 20: S\n\nTurn 21: S\n\nTurn 22: U\n\nTurn 23: S\n\nTurn 24: U\n\nTurn 25: U\n\nTurn 26: U\n\nTurn 27: U\n\nTurn 28: U\n\nThen at turn 29, y=9.\n\nIn terms of the action sequence for the turns.\n\nIn the box, it should be for each turn.\n\nAlso, in the car state, freeway 5-8 have three cars, but we already computed the unsafe times.\n\nNow, to write in the format.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 20: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 21: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 22: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 23: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 24: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 25: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 26: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 27: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 28: \\text{ U} \\end{array} }\n\nBut H=9 actions, from t=20 to t=28.\n\nIn the sequence, after last action at t=28, position at t=29 is 9.\n\nIn the answer, it should be the actions to reach at t=20+H.\n\nYes.\n\nTo make it shorter, but not possible.\n\nAnother sequence: since we need to be at y=4 at t=24, and we can reach there faster but with same end time.\n\nFor example, a20: U, to y=4 at t=21\n\nThen a21: S, a22: S, a23: S, to stay at y=4 for t=22,23,24? Positions: after a20:U, t=21:y=4\n\na21:S, t=22:y=4\n\na22:S, t=23:y=4\n\na23:S, t=24:y=4\n\nThen same as above.\n\nBut in this, at t=22: y=4, which is fine, but we have actions S at t=21,22,23.\n\nIn my first sequence, I have S at t=20,21 and S at t=23, so similar.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nSo for the answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 3)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 20\\) is 9. This sequence avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by ensuring the player is not on rows 5-8 at turns 23 and 24 (\\(\\delta = 3\\) and \\(\\delta = 4\\)), when these rows are unsafe, and not on rows 1-4 at turns 27 and 28 (\\(\\delta = 7\\) and \\(\\delta = 8\\)), though the latter is not an issue in this sequence as the player is on higher rows by then.\n\nThe sequence of actions is:\n- Stay at row 3 for turns 20 and 21 to avoid moving into unsafe rows prematurely.\n- Move up to row 4 at turn 22.\n- Stay at row 4 at turn 23 to avoid rows 5-8 at the unsafe turn 23.\n- Stay at row 4 at turn 24 to avoid rows 5-8 at the unsafe turn 24.\n- From turn 25 onwards, move up each turn to reach row 9 efficiently, as rows 5-8 are safe after turn 24.\n\nThe actions and resulting positions are:\n\n| Turn | Action | Position at Turn End | Safety Check (δ = Turn - 20) | Notes |\n|------|--------|-----------------------|-----------------------------|-------|\n| 20   | S      | (0, 3)               | δ=0, row 3 safe (unsafe only at δ=7,8) | Stay at row 3. |\n| 21   | S      | (0, 3)               | δ=1, row 3 safe            | Stay at row 3. |\n| 22   | U      | (0, 4)               | δ=2, row 4 safe (unsafe only at δ=7,8) | Move to row 4. |\n| 23   | S      | (0, 4)               | δ=3, row 4 safe            | Stay at row 4 to avoid rows 5-8 unsafe at δ=3. |\n| 24   | U      | (0, 5)               | δ=4, row 5 unsafe? **But action moves to row 5 at turn 25, position checked at turn 24 is row 4.** | At turn 24, position is row 4 (safe). Action U moves to row 5 at turn 25. |\n| 25   | U      | (0, 6)               | δ=5, row 6 safe (rows 5-8 unsafe only at δ=3,4) | Safe to move up. |\n| 26   | U      | (0, 7)               | δ=6, row 7 safe            | Safe to move up. |\n| 27   | U      | (0, 8)               | δ=7, row 8 safe (rows 1-4 unsafe at δ=7, but row 8 safe) | Safe to move up. |\n| 28   | U      | (0, 9)               | δ=8, row 9 safe (no cars)  | Reach goal. |\n\n- **Turn 24 clarification**: At turn 24, the player is at row 4 (safe, as δ=4 and row 4 is unsafe only at δ=7,8). The action U moves the player to row 5 at turn 25. Since row 5 is unsafe at δ=4, but the player is not on row 5 until turn 25 (δ=5), which is safe, no collision occurs.\n- **Unsafe times**: \n  - Rows 5-8 unsafe at δ=3 (turn 23) and δ=4 (turn 24). The sequence avoids these rows at these turns by being on row 4.\n  - Rows 1-4 unsafe at δ=7 (turn 27) and δ=8 (turn 28), but the player is on row 7 at turn 27 and row 8 at turn 28, which are safe for rows 5-8 at these δ values.\n\nThis sequence achieves the goal in 9 turns (actions from turn 20 to turn 28, reaching (0,9) at turn 29) and is minimal, as H=8 is impossible due to the constraint that the player must be at row ≤4 at turns 23 and 24, making it impossible to reach row 9 by turn 28 with only 8 actions.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 20: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 21: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 22: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 23: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 24: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 25: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 26: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 27: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 28: \\text{ U} \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,3) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible without colliding with any cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t1 = 21, and I'm at y=3. Actions are U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), or S (stay, y same), and y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the car movements. All cars are moving right with speed 6. For each car, the head and tail are given, and since they're moving right, the span at time T is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] because for right-moving, span goes from tail to head.\n\nIn the car update, for right-moving: Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nAnd collision happens at turn T only if the player is on that freeway at that turn and 0 is in the span for any car on that row.\n\nAlso, important: when I move to a new y, I'm not on that new row until the next turn. So at turn T, if I move, I'm on y_T for that turn, and then at turn T+1, I'm on y_{T+1}.\n\nLet me denote the current time as t = 0 relative to t1 to simplify. So t1 = 21, let τ = t - t1, so at τ=0, we start.\n\nPlayer position: at τ=0, y=3.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at some turn, say at relative time H, so y_H = 9.\n\nEach action changes y by +1, -1, or 0, with y clamped to [0,9].\n\nSince we start at y=3 and need to go to y=9, we need to increase y by 6, so minimum moves would be 6 up actions, but we might have to stay or move down to avoid cars, so H could be more than 6.\n\nBut we need minimal H.\n\nNow, cars: for each freeway k from 1 to 8, there are cars with positions at τ=0.\n\nList all cars per row.\n\nFrom the table:\n\nRow 1: two cars: (h=30, τ=19, d=right, s=6) and (h=-36, τ=-47, d=right, s=6)\n\nSince moving right, span at time τ relative: [τ + 6τ, h + 6τ] for each, but τ here is tail, not time.\n\nBetter to use different variable.\n\nSet time from start: let t be the time step relative to t1, so at t=0, current state.\n\nFor a car, at time t (relative), span is:\n\nFor right-moving: [τ + s*t, h + s*t] where τ and h are at t=0.\n\nSimilarly for left, but all are right here.\n\nAll cars are right-moving.\n\nNow, collision if at time t, player is on row y, and for that row, there is a car such that 0 is in the span at time t, meaning min(span) <= 0 <= max(span).\n\nSince span is [τ + s t, h + s t] for right-moving.\n\nτ is tail, h is head, so for right-moving, tail is left, head is right, so span is [tail + s t, head + s t].\n\nSo 0 in span if tail + s t <= 0 <= head + s t.\n\nSimilarly for other cars.\n\nNow, for each row, let's list the cars and their spans as function of t.\n\nFirst, row 1: two cars\n\nCar A: τ=19, h=30, s=6\n\nAt time t, span: [19 + 6t, 30 + 6t]\n\nCar B: τ=-47, h=-36, s=6\n\nSpan: [-47 + 6t, -36 + 6t]\n\nNow, 0 in span for car A if 19 + 6t <= 0 <= 30 + 6t\n\nBut 19 + 6t <=0 implies 6t <= -19, t <= -19/6 ≈ -3.166, which is impossible since t>=0. Similarly, 0 <= 30 + 6t always true for t>=0, but since min is 19+6t >0 for t>=0, so 0 never in span for car A. Similarly, for car B: -47 +6t <=0 <= -36 +6t\n\nLeft: -47+6t <=0 => 6t <=47 => t <= 47/6 ≈7.833\n\nRight: 0 <= -36 +6t => 6t >=36 => t>=6\n\nSo 0 in span when t>=6 and t<=7.833, so t=6,7 since t integer.\n\nt=6: min = -47+36= -11? -47 +6*6 = -47+36= -11\n\nMax = -36 +36=0\n\n-36 +6*6 = -36+36=0, so [ -11, 0], so 0 is included.\n\nt=7: min=-47+42= -5, max=-36+42=6, so [-5,6], 0 included.\n\nt=8: min=-47+48=1, max=-36+48=12, [1,12], 0 not included.\n\nSimilarly, for car A, never.\n\nSo for row 1, collision possible only from car B at t=6 and t=7.\n\nNow row 2: same as row 1? From table:\n\nRow 2: (30,19,right,6), (-36,-47,right,6) same as row 1.\n\nIn table it says for row 2: same cars, so identical to row 1.\n\nRow 3: same, row 4 same.\n\nRow 5: (30,19,right,6), (-48,-59,right,6), (-12,-23,right,6)\n\nThree cars.\n\nSimilarly for row 6,7,8 same as row 5.\n\nLet's confirm:\n\nRow 1 to 4: two cars each: (30,19,r,6) and (-36,-47,r,6)\n\nRow 5 to 8: three cars: (30,19,r,6), (-48,-59,r,6), (-12,-23,r,6)\n\nNow, for row 1, we have collision at t=6,7.\n\nSimilarly for row 2,3,4 same, since same cars.\n\nNow row 5: cars:\n\nCar C: τ=19, h=30, s=6, span [19+6t, 30+6t], min>0 for t>=0, never collision.\n\nCar D: τ=-59? h=-48? In table: (-48,-59,right,6) so head h=-48, tail τ=-59? Let's see.\n\nIn the car state: it says (head h, tail τ, direction, speed)\n\nFor row 5: (-48, -59, right, 6) so I think h=-48, τ=-59? But for right-moving, head should be greater than tail, -48 > -59, yes, so τ=-59, h=-48.\n\nSimilarly, (-12,-23,right,6) so τ=-23, h=-12? No: (-12,-23) so head h=-12, tail τ=-23.\n\nAnd (30,19,right,6) h=30, τ=19.\n\nNow, for car with τ=-59, h=-48, s=6\n\nSpan at t: [ -59 +6t, -48 +6t]\n\n0 in span: -59+6t <=0 <= -48+6t\n\nLeft: -59+6t <=0 => 6t<=59 => t<=59/6≈9.833\n\nRight: 0 <= -48+6t => 6t>=48 => t>=8\n\nSo t=8,9\n\nt=8: min=-59+48= -11, max=-48+48=0, [-11,0], 0 included\n\nt=9: min=-59+54= -5, max=-48+54=6, [-5,6], 0 included\n\nt=10: min=-59+60=1, max=-48+60=12, [1,12], no 0\n\nSimilarly, car with τ=-23, h=-12, s=6\n\nSpan: [-23+6t, -12+6t]\n\n0 in span: -23+6t <=0 <= -12+6t\n\nLeft: -23+6t <=0 => t<=23/6≈3.833\n\nRight: 0<= -12+6t => t>=2\n\nSo t=2,3\n\nt=2: min=-23+12= -11, max=-12+12=0, [-11,0], 0\n\nt=3: min=-23+18= -5, max=-12+18=6, [-5,6], 0\n\nt=4: min=-23+24=1, max=-12+24=12, [1,12], no\n\nAnd car with τ=19,h=30, never.\n\nSo for row 5, collision at t=2,3 from car (-12,-23) and t=8,9 from car (-48,-59)\n\nSimilarly for row 6,7,8 same.\n\nNow, row 1 to 4: collision only at t=6,7 from car (-36,-47)\n\nRow 5 to 8: collision at t=2,3 and t=8,9\n\nt=2,3 from one car, t=8,9 from another.\n\nWe need to get from y=3 at t=0 to y=9 at some H.\n\ny must be integer, actions change y by -1,0,+1.\n\nWe start at t=0, y=3.\n\nAt each turn t, we choose action, which determines y_{t+1}, but when we are on a row at time t, we check if collision for that row at time t.\n\nLet me clarify the timing.\n\nAt the beginning of turn t, we are at position (0, y_t).\n\nWe choose action a_t, which determines Δy_t, so y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, clamped.\n\nThen, after moving, at the end of the turn, I think we are on y_{t+1} for the collision check? No.\n\nLet's see the game dynamics.\n\n\"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nSo, at turn T, you are on freeway y_T, regardless of what action you take. After taking action, you move to y_{T+1}, but for collision at turn T, it's based on y_T.\n\nSo, when you are at turn T, you are on row y_T, and you might collide if for that row, at time T, 0 is in some car's span.\n\nThen you take action, go to y_{T+1}, and at turn T+1, you are on y_{T+1}, check collision there.\n\nIn this case, since we are only moving vertically, and horizontally at x=0, collision depends only on the row and time.\n\nWe need to ensure that for each time t from 0 to H-1, when we are at y_t, it is safe, meaning no collision on that row at time t.\n\nAt time t=H, we reach y_H=9, and we don't care about collision at t=H? The goal is to reach (0,9), and I think we need to be there without colliding, so probably we need to be safe at the time we arrive.\n\nBut at turn t, if y_t=9 and we are on it, we need no collision at that turn.\n\nThen, if we stay or something, but since we want to minimize turns, probably we arrive and stop.\n\nNow, for y=9, there are no cars, since cars only on y=1 to 8, so y=9 is always safe, similarly y=0 is safe, but we start from y=3.\n\ny=0 and y=9 have no cars, so safe at all times.\n\nNow, we start at t=0, y=3.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nThe minimal path would be to go up as much as possible, but avoiding collisions.\n\nSince we need min turns, we should avoid staying or going down unless necessary.\n\nBut going down might be needed to avoid a collision row at certain time.\n\nNow, let's list for each row and time when it is unsafe.\n\nFirst, rows 1 to 4: unsafe at t=6 and t=7.\n\nRow 1 to 4 are identical, unsafe at t=6,7.\n\nRows 5 to 8: unsafe at t=2,3 and t=8,9.\n\nt=2,3 and t=8,9.\n\nWe are at y=3 at t=0.\n\ny=3 is row 3? y=3 is freeway 3, I think.\n\nFreeway k is y=k, I assume.\n\ny=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8.\n\nAt t=0, we are on y=3.\n\nIs y=3 safe at t=0?\n\ny=3 is row 3, which has same as row 1, unsafe only at t=6,7.\n\nAt t=0, for row 3: cars same as row 1.\n\nCar A: span [19+0,30+0]=[19,30], not include 0.\n\nCar B: span [-47+0,-36+0]=[-47,-36], min=-47, max=-36, both negative, so 0 not in, since -47 <=0? -47 <=0 is true, but 0 <= -36? 0 <= -36 is false, so 0 not in [-47,-36].\n\n0 <= max must hold, but max=-36 <0, so 0 > max, not in span.\n\nSimilarly, at t=0, all min and max negative or positive, but for row 3, at t=0, safe.\n\nSimilarly, we need to go to y=9.\n\ny=9 is safe always.\n\nNow, we need to move from y=3 to y=9 in min steps.\n\nEach up move increases y by 1.\n\nWe need to go from 3 to 9, so min 6 up moves.\n\nBut we might need to stay or go down to avoid being on unsafe row at unsafe time.\n\nSince we start at t=0, and we can control when we are on which row.\n\nLet me denote the time we arrive at each y.\n\nSince we start at y=3, t=0.\n\nLet t_y be the time when we are at row y for the first time or something, but we might visit rows multiple times, but since we want min time, probably we go up directly, but might need to delay.\n\nTo min H, we should go up as fast as possible, but if at some point we would be on unsafe row at unsafe time, we need to avoid that by staying or moving down temporarily.\n\nBut moving down might cost extra turns.\n\nSince y=0 and y=9 are safe, we can go to y=0 or stay to wait.\n\nBut y=0 is safe, but going down might not be efficient.\n\nFirst, let's see the unsafe times for each row.\n\nRow y=1: unsafe t=6,7\n\ny=2: same, t=6,7\n\ny=3: same, t=6,7\n\ny=4: same, t=6,7\n\ny=5: unsafe t=2,3 and t=8,9\n\ny=6: same\n\ny=7: same\n\ny=8: same\n\nWe are starting at y=3, t=0.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nThe critical times are around t=2,3,6,7,8,9.\n\nSince we start at t=0, y=3, and y=3 is safe at t=0,1,2,3,4,5, except t=6,7.\n\nSimilarly, for y=4, safe except t=6,7.\n\ny=5 is safe except t=2,3 and t=8,9.\n\ny=6,7,8 similar.\n\nTo go from y=3 to y=9, we need to pass through y=4,5,6,7,8.\n\nSince min steps, we should go up each turn if possible.\n\nBut we need to avoid being on a row when it is unsafe.\n\nFor example, if we go up directly:\n\nt=0: y=3, safe\n\na_t=U, y=4 at t=1\n\nt=1: on y=4? At turn t=0, we are on y=3, take action U, so at t=1, we are on y=4.\n\nThen at turn t=1, we are on y=4, need to check if safe.\n\ny=4 unsafe only at t=6,7, so at t=1, safe.\n\nThen a_t=U, y=5 at t=2\n\nt=2: on y=5\n\ny=5 unsafe at t=2,3? t=2 is unsafe for y=5.\n\nOh, at t=2, on y=5, which is unsafe, collision.\n\nSo cannot be on y=5 at t=2.\n\nSimilarly, if we go to y=5 at t=1, but from y=4 at t=1, if we go U to y=5 at t=2, but at turn t=2, we are on y=5, which is unsafe.\n\nWe could stay on y=4 at t=1, but we are on y=4 at t=1.\n\nLet's list step by step.\n\nStart t=0, y=3, safe.\n\nAction: suppose U, then y=4 at t=1.\n\nTurn t=1: on y=4, safe since t=1 not 6 or 7.\n\nAction: if U, then y=5 at t=2.\n\nTurn t=2: on y=5, but y=5 unsafe at t=2, collision.\n\nNot good.\n\nSo at t=1, on y=4, instead of U, we could do S or D.\n\nIf S, stay on y=4, then at t=2, still on y=4.\n\ny=4 unsafe only at t=6,7, so at t=2, safe.\n\nThen at t=2, on y=4, action: if U, then y=5 at t=3.\n\nTurn t=3: on y=5, but y=5 unsafe at t=3, collision.\n\nStill problem.\n\nIf at t=2, on y=4, we do D, to y=3 at t=3.\n\nThen turn t=3: on y=3, which is safe at t=3 (since unsafe only t=6,7).\n\nThen from y=3, we can go U to y=4 at t=4, etc.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nWe need to avoid y=5 at t=2 and t=3.\n\nSimilarly, later we have t=6,7 for y=1-4, and t=8,9 for y=5-8.\n\nSince we are at y=3 at t=0, and we need to go up, but y=5 is unsafe at t=2,3, so we should not be on y=5 at t=2 or t=3.\n\nThe earliest we can be on y=5 is after t=3, so t=4 or later.\n\nSimilarly, for y=1-4, unsafe at t=6,7, so we should not be on y=1,2,3,4 at t=6 or t=7.\n\nNow, we start from y=3 at t=0.\n\nWe can spend some time at y=3 or y=4 or go down to y=0-2 to wait.\n\nBut going down might cost turns.\n\nSince y=0 is safe, we could go down to y=0 and stay, but that might increase H.\n\nTo minimize H, we should delay moving up or stay at safe rows.\n\nLet's think about the path.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nThe unsafe periods: for lower rows y=1-4, unsafe t=6,7\n\nFor upper rows y=5-8, unsafe t=2,3 and t=8,9.\n\nBut t=2,3 is early, t=6,7 medium, t=8,9 late.\n\nSince we start at t=0, y=3, which is lower row.\n\nt=2,3 is soon, and y=5 is unsafe then, so we cannot go to y=5 before t=4.\n\nSimilarly, we need to avoid being on y=1-4 at t=6,7.\n\nSo, one way is to be above y=4 by t=6.\n\nOr below, but below might be hard.\n\nLet's list possible actions.\n\nStart t=0, y=3, safe.\n\nNow, options:\n\n- Go up to y=4 at t=1.\n\n- Stay at y=3 at t=1.\n\n- Go down to y=2 at t=1.\n\nIf we go down, we might waste time.\n\nSimilarly at other points.\n\nTo avoid being on y=5 at t=2,3, we need to not reach y=5 before t=4.\n\nThat means, from t=0 to t=3, we should be at y<=4.\n\nAt t=0, y=3.\n\nAt t=1, we can be y=2,3,4.\n\nAt t=2, y=1,2,3,4.\n\nAt t=3, y=0,1,2,3,4.\n\nBut y=5 must be avoided at t=2,3.\n\nAlso, we need to avoid y=1-4 at t=6,7.\n\nNow, let's see how to go to y=5 at t=4 or later.\n\nSimilarly for higher rows.\n\nWe also have to consider the upper unsafe times t=8,9 for y=5-8.\n\nBut t=8,9 is later, we might be past that or something.\n\nFirst, let's get past the early unsafe times.\n\nSo, from t=0 to t=3, we need to be at y<=4.\n\nAt t=0, y=3.\n\nWe can, for example, stay at y=3 for a few turns or move down.\n\nBut moving down is bad, so better to stay or move up slowly.\n\nOption: at t=0, y=3, action S, so at t=1, still y=3.\n\nTurn t=1: on y=3, safe.\n\nThen at t=1, action S again, so at t=2, y=3.\n\nTurn t=2: on y=3, safe (not t=6,7).\n\nThen at t=2, action U, to y=4 at t=3.\n\nTurn t=3: on y=4, safe (t=3<6).\n\nThen at t=3, on y=4, action U to y=5 at t=4.\n\nNow turn t=4: on y=5.\n\nIs y=5 safe at t=4?\n\ny=5 unsafe at t=2,3 and t=8,9, not at t=4, so safe.\n\nThen we can proceed.\n\nAt t=4, on y=5, action U to y=6 at t=5.\n\nTurn t=5: on y=6.\n\ny=6 unsafe at t=2,3 and t=8,9.\n\nt=5 not 2,3 or 8,9, so safe.\n\nAction U to y=7 at t=6.\n\nNow turn t=6: on y=7.\n\ny=7 is row 7, which is unsafe at t=6? y=7 unsafe at t=2,3 and t=8,9.\n\nt=6 not 2,3 or 8,9, so should be safe.\n\nt=6: for row 7, unsafe only at t=2,3 and t=8,9, so t=6 is safe, yes.\n\nSimilarly, at t=6, on y=7, action U to y=8 at t=7.\n\nTurn t=7: on y=8.\n\ny=8 unsafe at t=2,3 and t=8,9.\n\nt=7 not 2,3 or 8,9, so safe.\n\nAction U to y=9 at t=8.\n\nNow turn t=8: on y=9, which is safe, no cars.\n\nWe have reached y=9 at t=8.\n\nBut at turn t=8, we are on y=9, and it is safe.\n\nNow, H is the number of turns from start including the arrival turn.\n\nWe started at t=0 (turn t1=21), and at t=8, we are at y=9.\n\nThe sequence: from t=0 to t=7 actions, and at t=8 we arrive.\n\nThe actions are for turns t1 to t1+H-1, I think.\n\nDefine H as the number of turns, so we reach at turn t1 + H -1? Let's see.\n\nIn the problem: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\", and y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nSo at time t1 + H -1, y=9.\n\nIn relative time, at time t = H-1, y=9.\n\nIn my notation, I set t=0 as start, so at time t, after t actions, we have done t moves? Let's clarify.\n\nAt the beginning of turn t (relative), we are at y_t.\n\nAfter action a_t, we go to y_{t+1}.\n\nThe turn is indexed by when we are on the position.\n\nAt turn t (relative to start), we are at position y_t, take action a_t, then at turn t+1, we are at y_{t+1}.\n\nCollision checked at each turn t for y_t.\n\nWe start at turn 0, y_0 =3.\n\nAfter H-1 actions, at turn H-1, we are at y_{H-1} =9.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t=0 to t=H-2? Let's see.\n\nThe actions are a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, meaning a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H -1}.\n\nAnd after these H actions, we have moved to the position at turn t1 + H.\n\nThe position is after the actions.\n\nAt turn T, before action, position y_T.\n\nAfter action a_T, position y_{T+1}.\n\nSo at turn t1, position y=3.\n\nWe apply a_{t1}, then at turn t1+1, position y1, and so on, up to turn t1 + H -1, we apply a_{t1 + H -1}, and then at turn t1 + H, position y=9.\n\nBut the turn when we reach y=9 is turn t1 + H.\n\nBut the sequence is actions from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nAnd we need y_{t1 + H} =9? No.\n\nThe problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H -1\"\n\n\"y_{t1 + H -1} =9\"\n\nAnd actions from t=0 to H-1 for a_{t1 + t}.\n\nSo at turn t1 + k, for k=0 to H-1, action a_{t1 + k}.\n\nAfter action a_{t1 + k}, we have position at turn t1 + k +1.\n\nSpecifically, at turn t1 + H -1, after action, position at turn t1 + H should be 9? Let's see.\n\nAt turn t1, position y_{t1} =3 (given).\n\nApply a_{t1}, then position at turn t1+1 is y_{t1+1}.\n\n...\n\nApply a_{t1 + H -1}, then position at turn t1 + H is y_{t1 + H}.\n\nBut we need y_{t1 + H -1} =9? Inconsistency.\n\nI think I misread.\n\nThe problem: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} such that y_{t1 + H -1} =9\"\n\ny_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nThat means at turn t1 + H -1, the position is (0,9).\n\nAnd we apply actions from t=0 to H-1, i.e., a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H -1}.\n\nThe last action a_{t1 + H -1} is applied at turn t1 + H -1, and after that, at the same turn or next?\n\nIn standard terms, at turn T, we are at position, take action, move to new position for next turn.\n\nBut here, y_{t1 + H -1} =9 means that at the start of turn t1 + H -1, we are at (0,9), or after action?\n\nThe position is given at the turn, I think.\n\n\"current turn is t1, position (0,y_{t1})\"\n\nSo at turn T, position is y_T.\n\nThen at turn T, we take action a_T, which determines y_{T+1}.\n\nThen at turn T+1, we are at y_{T+1}, and so on.\n\nNow, we need y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nThat means at turn t1 + H -1, we are at position y=9.\n\nAnd we have applied actions from turn t1 to turn t1 + H -2 to get to that position? Let's see.\n\nAt turn t1, we are at y_{t1}=3.\n\nWe apply action a_{t1}, which affects y_{t1+1}.\n\nThen at turn t1+1, we are at y_{t1+1}, apply a_{t1+1}, and so on.\n\nTo have y_{t1 + H -1} =9, we need to apply actions from turn t1 to turn t1 + H -2, so that at turn t1 + H -1, we are at y=9 without having to apply an action at that turn? But the action sequence includes a_{t1 + H -1}.\n\nIf at turn t1 + H -1, we are at y=9, and we apply a_{t1 + H -1}, it might move us away, but since y=9, if we apply S, we stay, or U/D, but y=9, U would be clamped to 9, I think, since y in [0,9], so U at y=9 might stay or error, but probably allowed to stay.\n\nThe position is clamped, so at y=9, U or S both keep y=9, D to y=8.\n\nBut to reach and be at y=9, we can apply S at that turn or something.\n\nIn the sequence, for y_{t1 + H -1} =9, it means that at the start of turn t1 + H -1, we are at (0,9), and we may apply an action, but the position is already 9.\n\nThe collision is checked at each turn based on the position at that turn.\n\nFor turn t1 + H -1, if we are at y=9, it is safe, and we can apply S or whatever, but since we have reached, we can just apply S.\n\nBut in the action sequence, we need to specify the actions to get there.\n\nThe actions are for turns t1 to t1 + H -1, and y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nSo, the actions from t1 to t1 + H -2 determine how we get to y_{t1 + H -1}, but at turn t1 + H -1, we apply a_{t1 + H -1}, which could be S to stay, or if we are not at 9, we move, but since y_{t1 + H -1} =9, we must be at 9 at the start of that turn.\n\nSo, for the last turn, we are already at 9, and we apply an action, but it doesn't change the position if we do S or U at y=9.\n\nIn terms of reaching, it is fine.\n\nIn our case, we can have H such that at turn t1 + H -1, we are at y=9.\n\nIn relative terms, at time t (from 0), at turn t, position y_t.\n\nWe need y_{H-1} =9 for some H.\n\nAnd actions a_t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nFor t from 0 to H-2, a_t determines y_{t+1}, and for t=H-1, a_{H-1} is applied, but since y_{H-1}=9, a_{H-1} can be S or U/D but position stays 9.\n\nBack to the path.\n\nIn my earlier plan, I had:\n\nt=0: y=3, safe\n\naction S? or U.\n\nIn the direct up with waiting:\n\nI had:\n\nt=0: y=3, safe, action S → y=3 at t=1? No.\n\nAction at turn t determines y_{t+1}.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t, apply a_t, get y_{t+1}.\n\nThen at turn t+1, position y_{t+1}.\n\nFor collision, at turn t, on position y_t, check for that row and time t.\n\nIn my sequence:\n\nStart: turn t=0, y=3, safe.\n\nApply action: let's say a0 = S, then y1 = y0 + Δy = 3 + 0 =3, so at turn t=1, position y=3.\n\nTurn t=1: y=3, safe (t=1 not 6 or 7)\n\nApply a1 = S, then y2 =3, at turn t=2, position y=3.\n\nTurn t=2: y=3, safe.\n\nApply a2 = U, then y3 =3+1=4, at turn t=3, position y=4.\n\nTurn t=3: y=4, safe (t=3<6)\n\nApply a3 = U, then y4 =4+1=5, at turn t=4, position y=5.\n\nTurn t=4: y=5, safe? y=5 unsafe at t=2,3, not t=4, so safe.\n\nApply a4 = U, then y5 =5+1=6, at turn t=5, position y=6.\n\nTurn t=5: y=6, safe? y=6 unsafe at t=2,3 and t=8,9, t=5 not, so safe.\n\nApply a5 = U, then y6 =6+1=7, at turn t=6, position y=7.\n\nTurn t=6: y=7, safe? y=7 unsafe at t=2,3 and t=8,9, t=6 not, so safe.\n\nApply a6 = U, then y7 =7+1=8, at turn t=7, position y=8.\n\nTurn t=7: y=8, safe? t=7 not 2,3 or 8,9, so safe.\n\nApply a7 = U, then y8 =8+1=9, at turn t=8, position y=9.\n\nNow, at turn t=8, y=9, which is the target.\n\nWe have y_{t=8} =9.\n\nIn terms of H, since at turn H-1 we need y=9, here at t=8, y=9, so H-1=8, thus H=9.\n\nt from 0 to 8, that's 9 turns? Indices: t=0 to t=8, that's 9 time points.\n\nTurn t=0 to t=8, that's 9 turns.\n\nBut y_{H-1} = y_8 =9, so H-1=8, H=9.\n\nActions from t=0 to t=H-1=8, so 9 actions.\n\nBut in the sequence, we applied actions a0 to a7 to get to y8=9.\n\na0 to a7: that's 8 actions? Let's list:\n\nActions applied at:\n\nAt turn 0: a0, to get y1? No.\n\nAt turn t, apply a_t, to determine y_{t+1}.\n\nBut position at turn t is y_t.\n\nWe need y_{H-1} =9.\n\nFor example, with H=9, y_{8} =9.\n\nWe apply actions a0 to a8? a_{t} for t=0 to H-1=8.\n\nBut a8 is applied at turn 8, when y8=9, and it determines y9, but we don't care about y9.\n\nSince y8=9, we can set a8=S, so y9=9, but we only care about y8=9.\n\nIn the action sequence, for turn t=8, we apply a8, but since we are already at 9, it can be S.\n\nIn terms of the path, with 8 actions from t=0 to t=7, we reach y8=9 at turn 8.\n\ny8 is position at turn 8.\n\nIn the sequence above, with actions:\n\nTurn 0: apply a0, after that y1\n\n...\n\nTurn 7: apply a7, after that y8\n\nSo with actions from turn 0 to turn 7, we have positions from y1 to y8.\n\nBut y0 is given at turn 0.\n\nWe need y_{H-1} at turn H-1.\n\nSo for H=9, turn H-1=8, y8=9.\n\nIn the above, with actions a0 to a7 applied at turns 0 to 7, we get y1 to y8.\n\ny8 is position after action at turn 7.\n\nAt turn 8, position y8.\n\nThen to have y8=9, we need to apply actions from turn 0 to turn 7 to set y8=9.\n\nThen at turn 8, we are at y8=9, and we apply a8, but for the sequence, a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, so for H=9, t=0 to 8, a0 to a8.\n\nAt turn 8, we apply a8, which can be S to stay at 9.\n\nSimilarly, in our case, with the above actions, we can set a8=S.\n\nBut in the path I described, we reached y8=9 at turn 8 with actions from t=0 to t=7.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- At turn 0: y0=3, apply a0=S, then y1=3\n\n- Turn 1: y1=3, apply a1=S, then y2=3\n\n- Turn 2: y2=3, apply a2=U, then y3=4\n\n- Turn 3: y3=4, apply a3=U, then y4=5\n\n- Turn 4: y4=5, apply a4=U, then y5=6\n\n- Turn 5: y5=6, apply a5=U, then y6=7\n\n- Turn 6: y6=7, apply a6=U, then y7=8\n\n- Turn 7: y7=8, apply a7=U, then y8=9\n\nSo at turn 8, y8=9.\n\nWe applied actions a0 to a7.\n\nFor H, y_{H-1}=y8=9, so H-1=8, H=9.\n\nThen the action sequence includes a0 to a8.\n\nBut we have a0 to a7, so for a8, at turn 8, we need to apply an action, but since we are at y=9, we can apply a8=S, so y9=9, but we don't care.\n\nIn the sequence, we can add a8=S.\n\nBut we reached at turn 8 with 8 actions? Actions a0 to a7 are 8 actions, but we have positions from y1 to y8, with y0 given.\n\nNumber of actions to go from y0 to y8 is 8 actions, over 8 turns? From turn 0 to turn 7 actions, to reach turn 8 position.\n\ny8 is after 8 actions? Let's count the turns.\n\nAt turn 0: position before action.\n\nAfter 0 actions, at turn 0, position y0.\n\nAfter 1 action (a0), at turn 1, position y1.\n\n...\n\nAfter k actions, at turn k, position y_k.\n\nTo have position at turn m be 9, we need after m actions, but y_m at turn m.\n\nWe need y_{H-1} =9 at turn H-1.\n\nWhich means after H-1 actions, we are at position 9 at turn H-1.\n\nThe actions applied are from turn 0 to turn H-2 to get to y_{H-1}, and at turn H-1, we apply a_{H-1}, but it doesn't affect y_{H-1}.\n\nIn practice, for the sequence, we specify actions for turns t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nIn this case, with H=9, we need 9 actions: a0 to a8.\n\nBut in the path above, with a0 to a7, we have y8=9, so for a8, we can set it to S.\n\nNow, back to the safety.\n\nIn the above sequence, we were at:\n\nt=0: y=3 safe\n\nt=1: y=3 safe\n\nt=2: y=3 safe\n\nt=3: y=4 safe\n\nt=4: y=5 safe\n\nt=5: y=6 safe\n\nt=6: y=7 safe\n\nt=7: y=8 safe\n\nt=8: y=9 safe\n\nAll safe.\n\nNow, we have to consider the later unsafe times, but in this case, we are not on y=5-8 at t=8,9 except possibly.\n\nAt t=8, we are on y=9, not on y=8.\n\nt=8: on y=9, safe.\n\nt=9 not reached.\n\nIn this sequence, we reached at t=8.\n\nBut is there a faster way?\n\nMinimal would be 6 up moves, but we had to wait at start.\n\nStart at y=3, t=0.\n\nIf we go up directly:\n\nt=0: y=3, safe, a=U, then y=4 at t=1\n\nt=1: y=4, safe (t=1<6), a=U, then y=5 at t=2\n\nt=2: y=5, but unsafe, collision.\n\nNot possible.\n\nGo up but avoid y=5 at t=2.\n\nFor example, at t=0, y=3, a=U, to y=4 at t=1\n\nt=1: y=4, safe, instead of U, do S, so a=S, then y=4 at t=2\n\nt=2: y=4, safe, then a=U, to y=5 at t=3\n\nt=3: y=5, unsafe at t=3, collision! Because t=3 is unsafe for y=5.\n\nOh, y=5 unsafe at t=3 as well.\n\nSo if we go to y=5 at t=3, still collision.\n\nSo we must not be on y=5 at t=2 or t=3.\n\nSo earliest to be on y=5 is t=4.\n\nSimilarly, in my first sequence, I stayed at y=3 until t=2, then to y=4 at t=3, then to y=5 at t=4.\n\nt=2: after action, y=4 at t=3? Let's see timeline.\n\nt=0: y=3, a=S, then y1=3 (position at t=1)\n\nt=1: y=3, a=S, then y2=3 (at t=2)\n\nt=2: y=3, a=U, then y3=4 (at t=3)\n\nt=3: y=4, a=U, then y4=5 (at t=4)\n\nt=4: y=5, a=U, etc.\n\nAt t=4, y=5, safe.\n\nCould we go faster?\n\nFor example, at t=0, y=3, a=U to y=4 at t=1\n\nt=1: y=4, instead of staying, but if we do S, y=4 at t=2, then at t=2, y=4, a=U to y=5 at t=3, but y=5 at t=3 unsafe.\n\nIf at t=1, y=4, we do D, to y=3 at t=2, then at t=2, y=3, safe, then a=U to y=4 at t=3, then a=U to y=5 at t=4, same as before, but we did an extra down, which costs more.\n\nWorse.\n\nGo down to y=0 or something, but slower.\n\nSo the sequence above seems efficient: two stays at start, then up all the way.\n\nBut in that sequence, we have H=9, with actions including the last S.\n\nBut we reached y=9 at t=8.\n\nNow, we have to check for the later times t=6,7 and t=8,9.\n\nIn the sequence, at t=6, we are on y=7, which is safe because for y=7, unsafe only t=2,3 and t=8,9, t=6 is safe.\n\nSimilarly t=7, y=8, unsafe only t=2,3,8,9, t=7 safe.\n\nt=8, y=9 safe.\n\nNow, what about t=8 and t=9 for y=5-8? We are not on those rows at that time.\n\nBut in this path, we are on y=5 at t=4, which is safe, y=6 at t=5 safe, etc.\n\nBut we need to ensure that when we are on y=8 at t=7, it is safe, which it is.\n\nNow, is there a way with fewer turns?\n\nMinimal H: we need to go from y=3 to y=9, difference 6, so min 6 up moves, but with waits.\n\nWith 6 up moves, we could reach in 6 turns if no delay, but here we need to avoid y=5 at t=2,3.\n\nSo we must delay the ascent to y=5 until t=4.\n\nWe can be at y=4 at t=1, but then we need to stay or something until t=3.\n\nFor example:\n\nt=0: y=3, a=U to y=4 at t=1\n\nt=1: y=4, a=S to y=4 at t=2? But at t=2, y=4, safe.\n\nThen at t=2, y=4, if we a=U to y=5 at t=3, but y=5 at t=3 unsafe.\n\nSo we must not go to y=5 at t=3.\n\nAt t=2, y=4, we can a=S again, to y=4 at t=3.\n\nt=3: y=4, safe (t=3<6), then a=U to y=5 at t=4.\n\nThen from there up.\n\nBut now:\n\nt=0: a=U → y1=4\n\nt=1: a=S → y2=4\n\nt=2: a=S → y3=4\n\nt=3: a=U → y4=5\n\nt=4: a=U → y5=6\n\nt=5: a=U → y6=7\n\nt=6: a=U → y7=8\n\nt=7: a=U → y8=9\n\nSo at turn t=8, y=9, same as before, but now we used one less stay? In this case, actions: a0=U, a1=S, a2=S, a3=U, a4=U, a5=U, a6=U, a7=U\n\nThen y8=9.\n\nNumber of actions: from a0 to a7, 8 actions, to reach y8=9 at turn 8.\n\nH-1=8, H=9, actions from t=0 to 8, so a8 needed.\n\nBut with a0 to a7, we have y8=9, so for a8, set S.\n\nCompared to first sequence where I had two S at beginning and then U, here I have U then two S then U...\n\nIn terms of turns, same H=9.\n\nIn first sequence: a0=S, a1=S, a2=U, a3=U, a4=U, a5=U, a6=U, a7=U → y8=9\n\nThis sequence: a0=U, a1=S, a2=S, a3=U, a4=U, a5=U, a6=U, a7=U → y8=9\n\nSame number.\n\nCan we reach earlier?\n\nSuppose we go down first to wait, but that would take more turns.\n\nFor example, at t=0, a=D to y=2 at t=1, then stay or something, but y=2 at t=1, then need to go up, but we start lower, so it takes more steps to reach y=9.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo min H should be 9.\n\nBut we have to consider the unsafe times at t=6,7 for y=1-4.\n\nIn this sequence, at t=6, we are on y=7, not on y=1-4, so safe.\n\nSimilarly t=7, y=8.\n\nt=6: y=7, which is row 7, unsafe at t=2,3,8,9, not t=6, so safe.\n\nBut what about t=8 and t=9 for y=8?\n\nAt t=7, we are on y=8, safe, then a=U to y=9 at t=8.\n\nAt t=8, we are on y=9, safe.\n\ny=8 at t=8: if we were on y=8 at t=8, it would be unsafe, but we are not; we are on y=9.\n\nIn the sequence, at t=7, y=8, we apply U, so at t=8, y=9.\n\nNo issue.\n\nSimilarly, for other rows.\n\nSo the sequence works.\n\nBut in the action list, for H=9, actions from t=0 to 8.\n\nIn the second sequence: actions:\n\nTurn 0: a0 = U  (to y=4)\n\nBut at turn 0, we apply a0, which sets y1.\n\nPosition at turn 1 is y1.\n\nIn terms of the turn when we are at position.\n\nPerhaps for the answer, we need to list actions for each turn starting from t1.\n\nBut let's confirm if we can do with H=8.\n\nSuppose H=8, then y_{7} =9 at turn 7.\n\nWe start at y0=3 at t=0.\n\nNeed to reach y7=9 at turn 7.\n\nSo we need to increase y by 6 in 7 moves, so one stay or down, but down worse.\n\nWith one stay, we can.\n\nFor example, go up 6 times with one delay.\n\nBut we need to avoid y=5 at t=2,3.\n\nSuppose:\n\nt=0: y=3, a=U → y1=4 at t=1\n\nt=1: y=4, a=U? But if a=U, y2=5 at t=2, unsafe.\n\na=S, y2=4 at t=2\n\nt=2: y=4, a=U → y3=5 at t=3, unsafe! Cannot.\n\na=S, y3=4 at t=3\n\nt=3: y=4, a=U → y4=5 at t=4\n\nNow t=4: y=5, safe.\n\nThen need to go to y=9 by t=7.\n\nFrom t=4, y=5, to t=7, we have 3 moves: to y=6,7,8, but we need y7=9.\n\nAfter 3 moves from t=4, we get to y7.\n\nAt t=4, position y4=5.\n\nApply a4 → y5\n\na5 → y6\n\na6 → y7\n\nWe need y7=9.\n\nSo from y4=5 to y7=9, need to increase by 4 in 3 moves, so possible with two U and one S, or three U but y=5 to y=9 is +4, so with three moves, we can go to y=6,7,8 or 9.\n\nBut y7=9, so we need to reach exactly 9.\n\nSo actions: a4=U → y5=6\n\na5=U → y6=7\n\na6=U → y7=8? Then y7=8, not 9.\n\na4=U → y5=6\n\na5=U → y6=7\n\na6=U → y7=8\n\nThen y7=8, not 9.\n\nTo get y7=9, we need from y4=5, after three actions, y7=9.\n\nSo must do three U: but U from 5: y5=6, y6=7, y7=8, then y7=8<9.\n\nIf we do U,U,U, we get to y7=8.\n\nThen we need to be at y=9 at turn 7, but we are at 8.\n\nIf we do U,U, but then y6=7, then a6=U, y7=8.\n\nStill 8.\n\nTo reach y=9, we need at least from y=5, three moves to y=8, then another move to y=9 at turn 8.\n\nBut for turn 7, we are at y=8 if we do that.\n\nBut we need y7=9, which requires starting from higher.\n\nIn this case, with delay, we are at y=5 at t=4, then to y=6 at t=5, y=7 at t=6, y=8 at t=7, so at turn 7, y=8, not 9.\n\nTo be at y=9 at turn 7, we need to be at y=9 at the start of turn 7.\n\nThat means we must have reached y=9 by turn 6 or earlier and stayed, or arrived at turn 7.\n\nBut from below, we can arrive at turn 7.\n\nFor example, if at turn 6, we are at y=8, apply U, then at turn 7, y=9.\n\nYes.\n\nBut in the above, at t=4, y=5, then:\n\nt=4: y=5, a=U → y5=6\n\nt=5: y=6, a=U → y6=7\n\nt=6: y=7, a=U → y7=8\n\nThen at turn 7, y=8.\n\nNot 9.\n\nTo get to y=9 at turn 7, we need at turn 6, to be at y=8 or y=9.\n\nIf at turn 6, y=8, apply U, then y7=9.\n\nIf at turn 6, y=9, apply S or U, y7=9.\n\nBut to be at y=8 or y=9 at turn 6.\n\nBut from t=4, y=5, to turn 6, we have two actions: a4 and a5, to set y6.\n\ny6 could be 5,6,7,8.\n\nMax y6=8 if a4=U, a5=U, y6=7? From y5: after a4, y5=6 if U; then a5=U, y6=7.\n\nNot 8.\n\ny4=5, a4=U → y5=6\n\na5=U → y6=7\n\nThen at turn 6, y=7.\n\nThen to have y7=9, need to go to y=9 from y=7 in one move, impossible; +2 not possible.\n\nSo from y=5 at t=4, the highest we can be at t=6 is y=7, and at t=7 y=8.\n\nCannot reach y=9 by t=7.\n\nWith earlier start.\n\nSuppose we go up faster initially but avoid the unsafe.\n\nBut we cannot be on y=5 before t=4.\n\nAt t=0, y=3, a=U → y1=4\n\nt=1: y=4, a=S → y2=4\n\nt=2: y=4, now cannot go U to y=5 at t=3, so must a=S → y3=4\n\nt=3: y=4, a=U → y4=5\n\nNow t=4: y=5, same as before.\n\nThen we can go up: a=U → y5=6\n\na=U → y6=7\n\na=U → y7=8\n\nThen at turn 7, y=8, not 9.\n\nTo reach y=9 at turn 7, we need y7=9, which requires that at some point we were higher earlier, but we are delayed by the unsafe time.\n\nWithout the delay, we could be at y=5 at t=2, but unsafe, or at t=1, but from y=3 to y=5 in two moves: t=0 y=3 a=U to y=4 at t=1; t=1 y=4 a=U to y=5 at t=2, but unsafe.\n\nCannot.\n\nSo impossible to reach y=9 before turn 8.\n\nAt turn 8, y=9 is possible as in the sequence.\n\nThus minimal H=9.\n\nNow, for the action sequence.\n\nIn the sequence, we can use the second one or first.\n\nBut we need to output for turns starting from t1=21.\n\nAlso, for the last action, since we reach at turn t1 + H -1 = t1 + 8, with H=9, t1 + 8.\n\nRelative t=8.\n\nNow, actions from relative t=0 to t=8.\n\nIn the sequence I have actions for t=0 to t=7 to reach y8=9, and t=8 action can be S.\n\nIn the second sequence: actions:\n\nt=0: a=U (to go to y=4)\n\nt=1: a=S (stay y=4)\n\nt=2: a=S (stay y=4)\n\nt=3: a=U (to y=5)\n\nt=4: a=U (to y=6)\n\nt=5: a=U (to y=7)\n\nt=6: a=U (to y=8)\n\nt=7: a=U (to y=9)\n\nThen at turn t=8, position y=9, apply a8=S to stay.\n\nBut a8 at t=8 is applied, setting y9, but we don't care.\n\nIn the sequence, it is included.\n\nSince y8=9, and we apply a8, it can be S.\n\nNow, for the answer, we need to list the actions for each turn.\n\nCurrent turn is t1=21.\n\nSo for turn 21: action a_{t1} = a0\n\nIn relative, t=0 is turn t1=21.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 21: a_{21} = U (in this sequence)\n\nThen turn 22: a_{22} = S\n\nTurn 23: a_{23} = S\n\nTurn 24: a_{24} = U\n\nTurn 25: a_{25} = U\n\nTurn 26: a_{26} = U\n\nTurn 27: a_{27} = U\n\nTurn 28: a_{28} = U  (to go to y=9)\n\nAfter a28 at turn 28, y29=9? Let's see.\n\nAt turn 28 (relative t=7? Let's index.\n\nTurn t1=21: relative t=0, position y=3, apply a_{21} = U → y at turn 22 is 4\n\nTurn 22 (t=1): position y=4, apply a_{22} = S → y at turn 23 is 4\n\nTurn 23 (t=2): position y=4, apply a_{23} = S → y at turn 24 is 4\n\nTurn 24 (t=3): position y=4, apply a_{24} = U → y at turn 25 is 5\n\nTurn 25 (t=4): position y=5, apply a_{25} = U → y at turn 26 is 6\n\nTurn 26 (t=5): position y=6, apply a_{26} = U → y at turn 27 is 7\n\nTurn 27 (t=6): position y=7, apply a_{27} = U → y at turn 28 is 8\n\nTurn 28 (t=7): position y=8, apply a_{28} = U → y at turn 29 is 9\n\nNow, at turn 29, position y=9.\n\nBut we need y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nt1 + H -1 = 21 + H -1.\n\nAt turn 29, which is t1 + 8, since 21+8=29.\n\ny_{29} =9, so t1 + H -1 =29, 21 + H -1=29, so 20 + H =29, H=9.\n\nThen the last turn in action is turn t1 + H -1 =29? Action sequence up to a_{29}?\n\nActions are from a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H -1} = a_{21} to a_{29}.\n\nBut in above, we have actions from a21 to a28, which set y22 to y29=9.\n\ny29=9 at turn 29.\n\nThen at turn 29, we need to apply a29, which can be S, so y30=9, but we don't care.\n\nIn the sequence, for turn 29, a29=S.\n\nBut since we are already at y=9, and we specify the action.\n\nIn the answer, we can list:\n\nTurn 21: U\n\nTurn 22: S\n\nTurn 23: S\n\nTurn 24: U\n\nTurn 25: U\n\nTurn 26: U\n\nTurn 27: U\n\nTurn 28: U\n\nTurn 29: S  (since at turn 29, position y=9, we apply S to stay)\n\nBut in the action, a29 at turn 29 sets y30, but since we only care about position at turn 29, it is fine.\n\nTo avoid extra, but we have to include it.\n\nIn the first sequence with two S first:\n\nTurn 21: S (stay at y=3)\n\nThen y at turn 22 is 3\n\nTurn 22: S (stay) → y23=3\n\nTurn 23: U → y24=4\n\nTurn 24: U → y25=5\n\n...\n\nBut at turn 24: position y=4? Let's:\n\nTurn 21: a=S → y22=3\n\nTurn 22: a=S → y23=3\n\nTurn 23: a=U → y24=4\n\nTurn 24: a=U → y25=5\n\nThen turn 25: y=5, a=U → y26=6\n\netc, similar.\n\nBut in this case, we reach y=9 later? Turn 23: U to y24=4\n\nTurn 24: U to y25=5\n\nTurn 25: U to y26=6\n\nTurn 26: U to y27=7\n\nTurn 27: U to y28=8\n\nTurn 28: U to y29=9\n\nSo at turn 29, y=9, same as before.\n\nThen turn 29: a=S.\n\nSo H=9 in both cases.\n\nThe second sequence might be slightly better because we moved up earlier, but same H.\n\nIn the second sequence, we were at y=4 from t=1 to t=3, while in first at y=3 from t=1 to t=2.\n\nBut no difference.\n\nNow, we need to make sure about the collision at other times.\n\nIn the sequence: for row y=4, unsafe at t=6,7.\n\nIn the path, at t=6 relative, which turn?

The cars on each freeway move right with speed 6, and collision occurs only if the player is on a freeway \\(y\\) at turn \\(T\\) and 0 is within the span of any car on that freeway at that turn.\n\n### Analysis of Unsafe Times for Each Freeway\n- **Freeways \\(y = 1, 2, 3, 4\\)**:  \n  - Cars: \\((30, 19, \\text{right}, 6)\\) and \\((-36, -47, \\text{right}, 6)\\).  \n  - Unsafe when \\(0 \\in \\text{Span}(T)\\) for the second car at turns \\(T = 6\\) and \\(T = 7\\) relative to \\(t_1\\).  \n  - Safe at all other times.\n\n- **Freeways \\(y = 5, 6, 7, 8\\)**:  \n  - Cars: \\((30, 19, \\text{right}, 6)\\), \\((-48, -59, \\text{right}, 6)\\), and \\((-12, -23, \\text{right}, 6)\\).  \n  - Unsafe when \\(0 \\in \\text{Span}(T)\\):  \n    - For car \\((-12, -23, \\text{right}, 6)\\) at turns \\(T = 2\\) and \\(T = 3\\).  \n    - For car \\((-48, -59, \\text{right}, 6)\\) at turns \\(T = 8\\) and \\(T = 9\\).  \n  - Safe at all other times.\n\n- **Freeways \\(y = 0\\) and \\(y = 9\\)**: Always safe (no cars).\n\n### Path to Minimize Turns\n- Start at \\(y = 3\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 21\\) (relative time \\(t = 0\\)).  \n- To reach \\(y = 9\\) in minimal turns, avoid being on unsafe freeways at unsafe times:  \n  - Avoid \\(y = 5\\) at \\(t = 2\\) and \\(t = 3\\) (relative).  \n  - Avoid \\(y = 1, 2, 3, 4\\) at \\(t = 6\\) and \\(t = 7\\).  \n  - Avoid \\(y = 5, 6, 7, 8\\) at \\(t = 8\\) and \\(t = 9\\).  \n- The minimal \\(H\\) is 9, achieved by:  \n  - Moving up to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 22 (\\(t = 1\\)).  \n  - Staying at \\(y = 4\\) for turns 22 and 23 (\\(t = 1\\) and \\(t = 2\\)) to avoid \\(y = 5\\) at \\(t = 2\\) and \\(t = 3\\).  \n  - Moving up directly from \\(y = 4\\) to \\(y = 9\\) from turn 24 to 28 (\\(t = 3\\) to \\(t = 7\\)), reaching \\(y = 9\\) at turn 29 (\\(t = 8\\)).  \n- At turn 29 (\\(t = 8\\)), the position is \\(y = 9\\), and action \\(S\\) is applied to stay at \\(y = 9\\).\n\n### Action Sequence\nThe sequence of actions for turns \\(t_1 = 21\\) to \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 21 + 9 - 1 = 29\\) is:\n\n- Turn 21: \\(U\\) (move up to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 22)  \n- Turn 22: \\(S\\) (stay at \\(y = 4\\))  \n- Turn 23: \\(S\\) (stay at \\(y = 4\\))  \n- Turn 24: \\(U\\) (move up to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 25)  \n- Turn 25: \\(U\\) (move up to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 26)  \n- Turn 26: \\(U\\) (move up to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 27)  \n- Turn 27: \\(U\\) (move up to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 28)  \n- Turn 28: \\(U\\) (move up to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 29)  \n- Turn 29: \\(S\\) (stay at \\(y = 9\\))\n\n### Verification\n- **Collision avoidance**:  \n  - At \\(t = 2\\) and \\(t = 3\\) (turns 23 and 24), player is at \\(y = 4\\), which is safe for \\(y = 4\\) at these times.  \n  - At \\(t = 6\\) and \\(t = 7\\) (turns 27 and 28), player is at \\(y = 7\\) and \\(y = 8\\), which are safe for \\(y = 7\\) and \\(y = 8\\) at these times (unsafe only at \\(t = 2, 3, 8, 9\\)).  \n  - At \\(t = 8\\) (turn 29), player is at \\(y = 9\\), which is always safe.  \n- **Position at turn 29**: \\(y = 9\\), as required.\n\nThis sequence achieves the goal in \\(H = 9\\) turns, which is minimal, as it is impossible to reach \\(y = 9\\) by turn 28 (relative \\(t = 7\\)) due to the need to avoid \\(y = 5\\) at \\(t = 2\\) and \\(t = 3\\).\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 21: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 22: \\, S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 23: \\, S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 24: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 25: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 26: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 27: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 28: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 29: \\, S \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get the player from (0,4) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. The player can move up, down, or stay each turn, changing y by +1, -1, or 0, and y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nThe car positions are given at turn t_1 = 22, and they move left or right with constant speed. For right-moving cars, the span at time T is [τ + s(T - t_1), h + s(T - t_1)], and for left-moving, it's [h - s(T - t_1), τ - s(T - t_1)]. But looking at the car state, all cars are right-moving, since direction is \"right\" for all.\n\nLet me list the cars for each freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: two cars: (36,25,right,6) and (-30,-41,right,6)\n\nFreeway 2: same as freeway 1? It says (36,25,right,6), (-30,-41,right,6) — identical to freeway 1.\n\nFreeway 3: same\n\nFreeway 4: same\n\nFreeway 5: three cars: (36,25,right,6), (-42,-53,right,6), (-6,-17,right,6)\n\nFreeway 6: same as 5\n\nFreeway 7: same as 5\n\nFreeway 8: same as 5\n\nAnd for freeways 1-4, only two cars, but for 5-8, three cars.\n\nThe head and tail: for right-moving cars, head is larger, tail smaller, so for (36,25,right,6), head=36, tail=25, so at t_1=22, position is from 25 to 36? But span is [τ, h] for right-moving, since it says \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h]\" for right-moving.\n\nLet me read carefully:\n\nFor right-moving: \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\"\n\nSo at time t_1, span is from τ to h, with h > τ since it's right-moving.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, it would be h to τ with τ < h, but here all are right-moving.\n\nIn the car state, for example, (36,25,right,6), so τ=25, h=36, so at t_1=22, the car occupies x from 25 to 36.\n\nBut since it's right-moving, at time T, it will be from τ + s(T-t_1) to h + s(T-t_1).\n\nSimilarly, the other car (-30,-41,right,6), τ=-41, h=-30? -30 > -41, yes, so at t_1, from -41 to -30.\n\nAnd for freeways 5-8, there's an additional car (-6,-17,right,6), so τ=-17, h=-6.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T only if the player is at y_T, and for that freeway, at x=0, 0 is in the span of some car on that freeway at time T.\n\nImportant point: the player is only on one freeway per turn, at y_t. When moving, at turn T, player is at position (0, y_T), and we check collision only if for freeway y_T, there is a car such that 0 is in its span at that exact turn T.\n\nAlso, note that if you move to a different y, you are not on that freeway until the next turn.\n\nThe note says: if you move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you are not considered on y_{T+1} at turn T, so you don't collide with cars on y_{T+1} at turn T.\n\nSimilarly, you are on y_T at turn T, so you can collide with cars on y_T at turn T.\n\nThe player position is updated after the action, I think.\n\nLet's see the dynamics: \"Player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\"\n\nSo at time t, player is at y_t. Then action a_t is taken, which determines Δy_t, so y_{t+1} is set.\n\nThen for collision at time t: I think collision is checked at time t based on y_t and the car positions at time t.\n\nThe collision rule says: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd y_T is the player's y position at turn T.\n\nSo at each turn T, player is at (0, y_T), and we look at freeway y_T, and check if at time T, for any car on that freeway, 0 is within its span.\n\nIf yes, collision.\n\nOtherwise, safe.\n\nNow, the goal is to reach (0,9), which is freeway 9, but freeways are y=1 to 8, and y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, I assume no cars there.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars, so we can be there without collision.\n\nThe player starts at y=4, and needs to go to y=9.\n\ny=9 is the target, and it's safe.\n\nNow, to minimize H, the number of turns, including the starting turn? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence is from t=0 to H-1, so actions at t_1 to t_1 + H - 1, and position after H steps is at turn t_1 + H.\n\nDefine the turns.\n\nCurrent turn is t_1 = 22.\n\nPlayer position at turn 22 is (0,4).\n\nWe need to find actions a_t for t = t_1, t_1+1, ..., up to some T such that at turn T, y_T = 9.\n\nAnd H is the number of actions, I think.\n\nThe sequence {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}, so for t from 0 to H-1, actions at time t_1 + t.\n\nThen after H actions, at time t_1 + H, the position is y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nWe want y_{t_1 + H} = 9.\n\nAnd we start from y_{t_1} = 4.\n\nSo the number of actions is H, and we go from turn t_1 to turn t_1 + H.\n\nFor example, if H=0, but we start at y=4, not 9, so H at least 1? But with actions, we move.\n\nMinimal H such that after H actions, we are at y=9.\n\nSince y changes by at most 1 each turn, from 4 to 9, minimum 5 actions to go directly up, but we might need to avoid cars, so it could take more turns if we have to wait or detour.\n\nBut we can only move vertically, no horizontal movement, so we have to choose when to be on which freeway to avoid collisions.\n\nNow, the cars are moving, so we need to find a time when for each freeway we are on, at that turn, x=0 is not occupied by a car.\n\nSince cars move continuously, we need to find times when no car on that freeway has span including 0 at that turn.\n\nNow, for each freeway, we can find when it is safe to be there, i.e., when no car covers x=0.\n\nFirst, let's model the car positions over time.\n\nSet t_1 = 22 as reference.\n\nFor a car, at time T, the span is as given.\n\nFor right-moving car with τ, h, s at t_1.\n\nSpan at T: [τ + s(T - 22), h + s(T - 22)]\n\n0 is in span if τ + s(T - 22) <= 0 <= h + s(T - 22)\n\nSince h > τ, it's a interval.\n\nSimilarly for all.\n\nNow, for each freeway, we have multiple cars, so we need that for all cars on that freeway, 0 is not in span at time T for the freeway to be safe at T.\n\nThat is, for a given freeway and time T, if there exists a car on that freeway such that 0 is in its span at T, then unsafe; else safe.\n\nThen, for the player to be at freeway y at time T, it must be that at time T, freeway y is safe.\n\nNow, let's list for each freeway the cars.\n\nFirst, freeways 1 to 4: two cars each.\n\nCar A: τ=25, h=36, s=6\n\nCar B: τ=-41, h=-30, s=6? For freeway 1, cars: (36,25,right,6) and (-30,-41,right,6)\n\nIn the tuple, it's (head, tail, direction, speed), I think.\n\nIn the car state: \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nAnd for right-moving, head is larger.\n\nSo for (36,25,right,6), h=36, τ=25\n\nSimilarly, (-30,-41,right,6), h=-30, τ=-41\n\nSince -30 > -41.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nCar A: τ=25, h=36, s=6\n\nAt time T, span: [25 + 6(T-22), 36 + 6(T-22)]\n\n0 in span if 25 + 6(T-22) <= 0 <= 36 + 6(T-22)\n\nSimilarly, car B: τ=-41, h=-30, s=6\n\nSpan at T: [-41 + 6(T-22), -30 + 6(T-22)]\n\n0 in span if -41 + 6(T-22) <= 0 <= -30 + 6(T-22)\n\nNow, let's find for which T these inequalities hold.\n\nFirst, for car A:\n\n25 + 6(T-22) <= 0 <= 36 + 6(T-22)\n\nLeft: 25 + 6(T-22) <= 0 => 6(T-22) <= -25 => T-22 <= -25/6 ≈ -4.166 => T <= 22 - 4.166 = 17.833, so T <= 17 since T integer? Turns are discrete, I assume integers.\n\nT is turn number, integer.\n\nSo T-22 integer, let k = T - 22, integer.\n\nThen for car A:\n\n25 + 6k <= 0 <= 36 + 6k\n\nFirst, 25 + 6k <= 0 => 6k <= -25 => k <= -25/6 ≈ -4.166, so k <= -5 since k integer? k <= -5? -25/6 = -4.166, so k <= -5? Let's see:\n\n6k <= -25, since 6*(-5) = -30 <= -25, 6*(-4) = -24 > -25? -24 > -25, so 6*(-4) = -24, -24 > -25, so -24 <= -25 is false, so 25 + 6k <= 0 only if 6k <= -25, which for k integer, k <= -5 because k=-5, 6*(-5)= -30 <= -25, 25-30= -5 <=0 true; k=-4, 6*(-4)= -24, 25-24=1 >0, not <=0.\n\nSimilarly, right inequality: 0 <= 36 + 6k => 36 + 6k >=0 => 6k >= -36 => k >= -6\n\nNow, both must hold: 25+6k <=0 and 0 <=36+6k\n\nSo k <= -5 and k >= -6\n\nk <= -5 from left, k >= -6 from right.\n\nSo for k from -6 to -5 inclusive.\n\nk >= -6 and k <= -5, so k= -6, -5.\n\nFor k=-6: 25 +6*(-6) =25-36= -11 <=0, 0 <=36-36=0, 0<=0 true.\n\nFor k=-5: 25-30= -5 <=0, 0<=36-30=6, true.\n\nFor k=-4: 25-24=1 <=0? 1<=0 false, so not.\n\nSimilarly, k=-7: 25-42= -17 <=0 true, but 0 <=36-42= -6? 0<= -6 false, so not.\n\nSo only for k=-6 and k=-5, T-22= -6 or -5, so T=16 or 17.\n\nT=22+k, k=T-22.\n\nT=16: k=-6\n\nT=17: k=-5\n\nSo car A covers x=0 at times T=16 and T=17.\n\nNow car B: τ=-41, h=-30, s=6\n\n0 in span if -41 +6k <=0 <= -30 +6k, where k=T-22\n\nFirst, -41 +6k <=0 => 6k <=41 => k <= 41/6 ≈6.833, so k<=6\n\nSecond, 0 <= -30 +6k => 6k >=30 => k>=5\n\nSo k>=5 and k<=6, so k=5,6\n\nT=22+5=27 or T=22+6=28\n\nSo car B covers x=0 at T=27 and T=28.\n\nTherefore for freeway 1, it is unsafe when either car covers, so at T=16,17 from A, and T=27,28 from B.\n\nSince cars are separate, freeway unsafe if any car covers, so unsafe at T=16,17,27,28.\n\nOther times, safe.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 2,3,4, same cars, so same unsafe times: T=16,17,27,28.\n\nNow freeways 5-8 have three cars.\n\nCar C: (36,25,right,6) same as car A above, so covers T=16,17\n\nCar D: (-42,-53,right,6), so h=-42? τ=-53, h=-42? Since head larger, -42 > -53, so τ=-53, h=-42, s=6\n\n0 in span if -53 +6k <=0 <= -42 +6k\n\nFirst, -53+6k <=0 => 6k <=53 => k <= 53/6 ≈8.833, so k<=8\n\nSecond, 0 <= -42 +6k => 6k >=42 => k>=7\n\nSo k>=7 and k<=8, k=7,8\n\nT=22+7=29, T=22+8=30\n\nCar E: (-6,-17,right,6), τ=-17, h=-6, s=6\n\n0 in span if -17 +6k <=0 <= -6 +6k\n\nFirst, -17+6k <=0 => 6k <=17 => k <= 17/6 ≈2.833, so k<=2\n\nSecond, 0 <= -6 +6k => 6k >=6 => k>=1\n\nSo k>=1 and k<=2, k=1,2\n\nT=22+1=23, T=22+2=24\n\nAnd car C same as before, T=16,17\n\nSo for freeway 5, unsafe when car C covers: T=16,17\n\nCar D: T=29,30\n\nCar E: T=23,24\n\nSo all unsafe times: T=16,17,23,24,29,30\n\nSimilarly for freeways 6,7,8.\n\nNow, freeway 1 to 4 unsafe at T=16,17,27,28\n\nFreeway 5 to 8 unsafe at T=16,17,23,24,29,30\n\nNow, the player starts at turn t_1=22, at y=4.\n\nWe need to get to y=9.\n\ny=9 has no cars, so always safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 safe.\n\nNow, we can move up, down, or stay each turn.\n\nEach action changes y by +1, -1, or 0.\n\ny must be in 0 to 9.\n\nNow, to go from y=4 to y=9, minimum 5 up moves, but we might need to wait or go down to avoid unsafe times.\n\nWe need a sequence of actions from turn 22 onwards.\n\nAt each turn T, we choose action, which determines y_{T+1}, but for collision, at turn T, we care about y_T and the cars at T.\n\nLet me denote the state at each turn.\n\nStart: turn 22, y=4.\n\nNow, freeway 4 is part of 1-4, so unsafe at T=16,17,27,28.\n\nT=22 is not in that list, so at T=22, freeway 4 is safe? Let's check.\n\nUnsafe times for freeway 4: T=16,17,27,28\n\nT=22 not in, so at T=22, y=4, freeway 4 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, we need to go to y=9.\n\nSince we start at y=4, and want to reach y=9, we probably want to go up as much as possible.\n\nBut we need to avoid unsafe times on the freeways we are on.\n\nNow, let's list for each freeway the safe times, i.e., when not unsafe.\n\nSince unsafe times are discrete, safe when not those times.\n\nFor freeway 1-4: unsafe T=16,17,27,28. Since T=22 now, past T=16,17 are irrelevant, only future matters. T=16,17 are before t_1, so for future turns, only T=27,28 unsafe for freeways 1-4.\n\nSimilarly, for freeways 5-8, unsafe at T=16,17,23,24,29,30. T=16,17 past, so future unsafe T=23,24,29,30.\n\nNow, current turn T=22.\n\nAt T=22, y=4, which is freeway 4, and safe since not 27 or 28.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\ny=9 is safe always.\n\nThe minimal turns: if we go directly up, from y=4 to y=9 in 5 moves: U,U,U,U,U, so at turns: T=22, y=4; after a22=U, y23=5; a23=U, y24=6; a24=U, y25=7; a25=U, y26=8; a26=U, y27=9. So at turn 27, y=9.\n\nBut we need to check for each turn if collision occurs.\n\nAt each turn T from 22 to 26, we are at y_T, and need freeway y_T safe at T.\n\nSpecifically:\n\nTurn 22: y=4, freeway 4 safe at T=22? Yes, as above.\n\nTurn 23: y=5, but y=5 is freeway 5, which is in 5-8, unsafe at T=23? Freeway 5 unsafe at T=23,24,etc.\n\nAt T=23, freeway 5 is unsafe because of car E, which covers T=23.\n\nSimilarly, if we are at y=5 at T=23, we would collide.\n\nIn this sequence, at turn 23, y=5, and T=23, freeway 5 unsafe, so collision.\n\nThus, cannot go directly at turn 23 to y=5.\n\nTurn 24: y=6, freeway 6, unsafe at T=24? Freeway 6 unsafe at T=24, so also collision if at y=6 at T=24.\n\nTurn 25: y=7, freeway 7, unsafe? Freeway 7 unsafe at T=23,24,29,30. T=25 not unsafe, so safe.\n\nBut at T=23 and 24, if we are there, unsafe.\n\nIn the direct path, at T=23 and 24 we are on y=5 and y=6, both unsafe.\n\nSo need to avoid being on freeways 5-8 at T=23 and T=24.\n\nSince freeways 5-8 unsafe at T=23 and 24.\n\nSimilarly, at T=22, we are on y=4, safe.\n\nWe need to get to y=9.\n\nOptions: we can stay or move down to avoid being on unsafe freeways at unsafe times.\n\nFor example, at T=23, if we are not on freeways 5-8, but freeways 1-4 are safe except at T=27,28, which are later.\n\nFreeways 1-4 safe at T=23, since only unsafe at 27,28.\n\nSimilarly, at T=24, freeways 1-4 safe.\n\ny=0 and y=9 safe.\n\nSo one idea: at turn 22, we are at y=4, safe.\n\nInstead of moving up to y=5 at turn 23, we could stay at y=4 or move down to y=3.\n\nBut we need to go up eventually.\n\nSince T=23 and 24 are unsafe for y=5-8, we should not be on those rows at those times.\n\nSo perhaps stay at y=4 for T=23 or go down to lower.\n\ny=4 is freeway 4, which is safe at T=23 and 24.\n\nSimilarly, y=3,2,1 are also freeways 1-4, all safe at T=23,24.\n\ny=0 safe.\n\nThen after T=24, we can move up.\n\nT=23 and 24 are critical.\n\nNow, let's list the actions starting from turn 22.\n\nTurn 22: at y=4, we can choose a action for y_{23}.\n\na_t at time t affects y_{t+1}.\n\nAt time t, position y_t, action a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nThen at time t+1, position y_{t+1}, and collision check at t+1 based on y_{t+1}.\n\nFor turn T, collision based on y_T.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nAt turn 22: y=4, and we are there, collision check: freeway 4 at T=22 safe, so ok.\n\nThen we take action a_{22}, which sets y_{23}.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 23, we have y_{23}, and check collision at T=23 based on y_{23}, and so on.\n\nBack to planning.\n\nTo avoid collision at T=23 and T=24, we need that at T=23, y_{23} not in {5,6,7,8}, because freeways 5-8 unsafe at T=23.\n\nSimilarly at T=24, y_{24} not in {5,6,7,8}.\n\ny_{23} could be 4,3,2,1,0 or 9, but 9 is far, unlikely.\n\nSimilarly for y_{24}.\n\nSince we start at y=4 at T=22, we can:\n\nOption 1: at T=22, stay or move down, so that at T=23, y_{23} <=4, so on freeway 1-4 or y=0, all safe at T=23.\n\nSimilarly for T=24.\n\nThen after T=24, move up.\n\nFor example:\n\nAt turn 22: action S, so y_{23} = y_{22} + 0 = 4 (since Δy=0 for S)\n\nThen at turn 23: y=4, freeway 4, safe at T=23? Yes, as above.\n\nThen we can choose action for y_{24}.\n\nAt turn 24: if we stay or move down, y_{24} <=4, safe.\n\nBut we need to go up eventually.\n\nSince T=24 is unsafe for y=5-8, we can be at y=4 or below.\n\nBut at T=25, we can move up.\n\nNow, freeways 5-8 unsafe only at T=23,24,29,30.\n\nT=25,26,etc. should be safe for 5-8 except at 29,30.\n\nSimilarly, freeways 1-4 unsafe only at T=27,28.\n\nNow, to reach y=9 quickly.\n\nAfter T=24, we can go up.\n\nFor example:\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 22 (T=22): at y=4, action a_{22}. If we do S, then y_{23}=4.\n\nTurn 23 (T=23): at y=4, safe. Action a_{23}. If we do U, then y_{24}=5.\n\nBut at T=24, if y_{24}=5, freeway 5 unsafe, collision.\n\nNot good.\n\nIf at turn 23, we do S, y_{24}=4.\n\nThen turn 24 (T=24): at y=4, safe. Then action a_{24}, say U, then y_{25}=5.\n\nNow turn 25 (T=25): at y=5, freeway 5. At T=25, is freeway 5 safe? Unsafe times T=23,24,29,30. T=25 not unsafe, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, then we can continue up.\n\nAfter y_{25}=5, we can go to y=6 at T=26, etc.\n\nBut let's see the path.\n\nStart:\n\nT=22: y=4, safe. Action a_{22} = S (stay), so y_{23} =4\n\nT=23: y=4, safe (freeway 4 safe at T=23). Action a_{23} = S, so y_{24} =4\n\nT=24: y=4, safe. Action a_{24} = U, so y_{25} =5\n\nT=25: y=5, freeway 5, at T=25 safe? Yes, T=25 not 23,24,29,30. Safe.\n\nAction a_{25} = U, so y_{26} =6\n\nT=26: y=6, freeway 6, at T=26 safe? Unsafe times for freeway 6: T=23,24,29,30. T=26 not, so safe.\n\nAction a_{26} = U, so y_{27} =7\n\nT=27: y=7, freeway 7, at T=27? Freeway 7 unsafe at T=23,24,29,30. T=27 not, so safe? But freeway 7 is part of 5-8, unsafe only at 23,24,29,30, so T=27 safe.\n\nAction a_{27} = U, so y_{28} =8\n\nT=28: y=8, freeway 8, at T=28? Unsafe times T=23,24,29,30, so T=28 safe.\n\nAction a_{28} = U, so y_{29} =9\n\nT=29: y=9, which is not a freeway, so no cars, safe. And we reached y=9 at turn 29.\n\nBut is that minimal? We used 7 actions: from t=22 to t=28, actions at 22,23,24,25,26,27,28, 7 actions, y reaches 9 at turn 29.\n\nBut we started at turn 22, position at turn 22 is y=4, after H actions, at turn 22+H, y=9.\n\nHere H=7, turn 29.\n\nBut we can do better.\n\nIn this sequence, we stayed at y=4 for two extra turns (T=23 and 24), but we could move up earlier or later.\n\nAt T=22, instead of staying, we could move down to y=3, but that might be worse.\n\nAfter T=24, we moved up one per turn.\n\nBut notice that at T=25,26,27,28, all freeways 5-8 are safe except at 29,30 which are later.\n\nWe reached at T=29.\n\nBut we could reach earlier.\n\nFor example, if we can be at y=9 before T=29.\n\nMinimal from y=4 to y=9 is 5 up moves, so earliest at turn 27: if we go up every turn from T=22.\n\nT=22: y=4\n\na22=U, y23=5\n\nBut at T=23, if y=5, unsafe.\n\na23=U, y24=6, at T=24, y=6 unsafe.\n\nSo collision.\n\nCannot go up at T=23 and T=24.\n\nSo we must avoid being on y=5-8 at T=23 and T=24.\n\nThus, at T=23 and T=24, we must be on y<=4 or y=9, but y=9 far.\n\ny<=4.\n\nSince we start at y=4 at T=22, the earliest we can be at y=9 is if we leave after T=24.\n\nAt T=22, we are at y=4.\n\nAfter action, y_{23} set.\n\nTo be not on y=5-8 at T=23, so y_{23} <=4.\n\nSimilarly, at T=24, y_{24} <=4.\n\nThen at T=24, we are at y<=4, say y=4.\n\nThen from there, we can go up to y=9 in 5 moves: to y=5 at T=25, y=6 T=26, y=7 T=27, y=8 T=28, y=9 T=29. Same as before.\n\nBut we could be at lower y and move up faster, but moving down first might take more turns.\n\nFor example, at T=22, move down to y=3, then at T=23, y=3, safe; then move down again to y=2 at T=24, then at T=25 move up, but to reach y=9, from y=2, need 7 up moves, worse.\n\nOr stay, but staying at y=4 for T=23 and 24 seems best.\n\nAt T=22, we can stay, so y_{23}=4.\n\nAt T=23, instead of staying, we can move down to y=3, but then at T=24, we are at y=3, then we need to move up, but y=3 to y=9 takes 6 moves, to T=30, worse.\n\nNot better.\n\nSo minimal seems to be reaching at T=29 with H=7 actions.\n\nBut earlier I thought about T=27.\n\nIs it possible to reach y=9 at T=27?\n\nFrom y=4 at T=22, to y=9 at T=27, that requires increasing y by 5 in 5 turns, so must go up every turn: actions U,U,U,U,U at t=22,23,24,25,26.\n\nThen positions:\n\nT=22: y=4\n\na22=U, y23=5\n\nT=23: y=5, unsafe, collision.\n\nCannot.\n\nIf we skip some, but we must be at y=9 at T=27, which requires that from T=22 to T=27, we increase by 5, so exactly one up per turn, no down or stay, because if we stay or down, y decreases or same, need more up later.\n\nTo reach y=9 from y=4 in 5 turns, net +5, so must have five up moves and no down moves, and no stay if we want exactly +5, but stay would make it take more turns.\n\nIn K turns, to go from y=a to y=b, the minimal K is |b-a|, achieved by moving directly.\n\nIf we move directly, K= |b-a|.\n\nIf we deviate, K larger.\n\nHere |9-4|=5, so minimal K=5 actions to reach, at turn T=22 +5 =27.\n\nBut at T=23 and 24, on the way, we are on unsafe freeways.\n\nSpecifically, to be at y=9 at T=27, we must be at y=5 at T=23, y=6 at T=24, etc., which are unsafe.\n\nUnless we can be at different positions, but no, the path is fixed if we go directly up.\n\nSo impossible to reach at T=27 without colliding at T=23 or 24.\n\nSimilarly, T=28: to be at y=9 at T=28, need to start from T=22, in 6 actions? From T=22 to T=28, 6 turns, y from 4 to 9, net +5, so we can have 5 up and one extra action, which could be stay or down, but that would make y at T=28 less than 9 if we have a stay or down.\n\nFor example, if we have 5 up and one stay, then at T=28, y=9 only if the stay is not used, but with 6 actions, if one stay, then after 6 actions, y=4 +5 -0 or something, but actions: each up +1, down -1, stay 0.\n\nAfter K actions, y = 4 + (number of U) - (number of D).\n\nTo reach y=9, 4 + U - D =9, so U - D =5.\n\nAlso, number of actions K = U + D + S.\n\nWe want minimal K such that U - D =5.\n\nSince D >=0, minimal K when D=0 and S=0, so U=5, K=5.\n\nBut with K=5, we have collision.\n\nIf we have S or D, then U must be larger, K larger.\n\nFor example, if we have one stay, then U - D =5, and K = U + D + S >= U + S >=6, since U >=5.\n\nSimilarly, with down, U must be at least 5 + D, so K = U + D + S >= (5+D) + D + S >=5 + 2D + S >=5.\n\nBut K>5 if D>0 or S>0.\n\nSo minimal K=5, but not possible due to collision.\n\nThus next is K=6, reach at T=28.\n\nWith K=6 actions, U - D =5.\n\nPossible with U=5, D=0, S=1; or U=6, D=1, S=0, etc.\n\nBut U=5, D=0, S=1: one stay, so we stay one turn, but where.\n\nSimilarly, to avoid collision at T=23 and 24.\n\nNow, reach at T=28: y_{28}=9.\n\nThen we must have y_{28}=9.\n\nThe position at each turn.\n\nT=28: y=9, safe.\n\nTo have y=9 at T=28, it came from y_{27} and action a_{27}, y_{28} = y_{27} + Δy_{27}.\n\nSince y_{28}=9, and y_{27} <=9, so if y_{27}=8, a_{27}=U; or y_{27}=9, a_{27}=S; or y_{27}=10 impossible, y max 9.\n\nSimilarly, back.\n\nBut we need to set from start.\n\nWith K=6, actions from t=22 to t=27, 6 actions, y at t=28.\n\nStart at T=22, y=4.\n\nAfter 6 actions, y_{28} = 4 + sum Δy from t=22 to t=27.\n\nΔy = +1 for U, -1 for D, 0 for S.\n\nSet U, D, S such that U - D =5, U + D + S =6.\n\nThen U - D =5, U + D + S =6.\n\nAdd: 2U + S =11, so S=11-2U.\n\nSince U >=5, and S >=0.\n\nIf U=5, then S=11-10=1, D=0.\n\nIf U=6, then S=11-12=-1<0 impossible.\n\nU=5, S=1, D=0.\n\nOr U=6, not possible.\n\nU=5, S=1, D=0: five ups and one stay.\n\nNow, we need to place the stay somewhere to avoid being on unsafe freeways at unsafe times.\n\nUnsafe times: T=23 and T=24 for freeways 5-8.\n\nAlso, later T=27,28 for freeways 1-4, but we are going up, so on higher freeways.\n\nT=29,30 for 5-8, but later.\n\nNow, the stay can be at a safe position.\n\nWe start at T=22, y=4.\n\nWe need to have y_{28}=9.\n\nThe sequence of y_t.\n\ny_{22} =4\n\nThen y_{23}, y_{24}, ..., y_{28}=9\n\nWith one stay, so five up and one no move.\n\nNet +5.\n\nThe stay must be at some turn, meaning at that turn, we do S, so y_{t+1} = y_t.\n\nNow, to avoid T=23 and T=24 unsafe.\n\nAt T=23, y_{23} must not be in {5,6,7,8}, so y_{23} <=4 or y_{23}=9, but 9 not yet.\n\nSimilarly at T=24, y_{24} <=4.\n\nNow, y_{22}=4.\n\nIf at T=22, we do U, then y_{23}=5.\n\nBut y_{23}=5, which is in 5-8, and T=23 unsafe, collision.\n\nNot good.\n\nIf at T=22, we do S, then y_{23}=4.\n\nThen at T=23, y=4 <=4, safe.\n\nThen we can do action.\n\nNow, at T=23, we need to set y_{24}.\n\nIf we do U, y_{24}=5, but at T=24, y=5 unsafe, collision.\n\nIf we do S, y_{24}=4, safe at T=24.\n\nThen at T=24, we do U, y_{25}=5.\n\nThen continue up to y_{28}=9.\n\nBut this has two stays, not one.\n\nIn this case, with U=5, S=1, D=0, but here if we have only one stay, we need to go up faster.\n\nFor example, after y_{23}=4, if at T=23 we do U, but y_{24}=5, which at T=24 unsafe.\n\nCannot.\n\nAt T=22, if we do D, but that would make y lower, need more up later.\n\nSuppose we do a down move.\n\nBut U - D =5, so if we do one down, we need six up, K= U + D + S =6 + D + S, but U=6 if D=1, then K=6+1+S=7+S>=7, worse than 6.\n\nNot better.\n\nSo only possibility with K=6 is U=5, S=1, D=0.\n\nNow, we must place the stay such that we avoid being on unsafe freeways at wrong times.\n\nSpecifically, we need that at T=23, y_{23} <=4, and at T=24, y_{24} <=4.\n\nNow, y_{22}=4.\n\nIf we do S at T=22, then y_{23}=4 <=4, good for T=23.\n\nThen at T=23, we must have y_{23}=4, and we need y_{24} <=4.\n\nSo action at T=23 must be S or D.\n\nIf we do S, y_{24}=4 <=4, good.\n\nThen at T=24, y=4, we can do U, y_{25}=5, and so on, but this has S at T=22 and S at T=23, two stays, but we only have one stay to place? Contradiction.\n\nWith U=5, S=1, we have only one stay.\n\nBut here to satisfy both T=23 and T=24, we need two stays or one down.\n\nSuppose at T=22, we do S, so y_{23}=4 (stay used).\n\nThen at T=23, we must do something to keep y_{24} <=4.\n\nOptions: if we do U, y_{24}=5 >4, not <=4, and unsafe.\n\nIf we do S, y_{24}=4, but that would be another stay, but we have only one stay, so we cannot do S again without using extra S.\n\nIn the action sequence, we have only one S action.\n\nSo at T=23, we must do U or D, not S.\n\nIf U, y_{24}=5, unsafe at T=24.\n\nIf D, y_{24}=3.\n\nThen y_{24}=3 <=4, safe at T=24.\n\nThen at T=24, y=3, we can do U, y_{25}=4.\n\nBut y=4 at T=25, freeway 4, which is unsafe at T=27,28? T=25 not 27 or 28, so safe.\n\nThen we need to go up to 9.\n\ny_{25}=4\n\nThen we need to reach y=9 by T=28.\n\nFrom y=4 at T=25 to y=9 at T=28, in 3 actions? y_{28}=9.\n\nFrom T=25 to T=28, 3 turns: T=25,26,27 actions, y at T=26,27,28.\n\ny_{25}=4\n\nAfter a25, y26\n\nAfter a26, y27\n\nAfter a27, y28\n\nTo have y28=9, and from y25=4, need +5 in 3 actions, impossible with max +1 per action.\n\ny28 = y25 + Δy25 + Δy26 + Δy27\n\nEach Δy <=1, so y28 <= 4 +1+1+1=7 <9, cannot reach 9.\n\ny25=4, after first action y26 <=5, y27<=6, y28<=7, max 7 at T=28, but we need y28=9, impossible.\n\nThus, if we go down at some point, we cannot reach y=9 by T=28.\n\nTherefore, with K=6 actions, it is impossible to reach y=9 at T=28 without colliding or without enough increase.\n\nThe only way with K=6 is to have the stay at a point where it doesn't cause issue, but we must avoid T=23 and 24 on y=5-8.\n\nBut as above, if we start at y=4 T=22, to have y_{23} <=4, we must do S or D at T=22.\n\nIf S, y_{23}=4, then at T=23, to have y_{24} <=4, we must do S or D at T=23.\n\nBut with only one S, we cannot do S at both; if we do D at T=23, y_{24}=3, then as above, we are behind and cannot reach y=9 by T=28.\n\nIf we do nothing at T=22, but we have to take action.\n\nPerhaps we can be on y=9 earlier, but with K=6, y at T=28.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps we can move up at T=22 to y=5, but at T=23 y=5 unsafe, unless we can be safe, but it is unsafe, collision.\n\nNo.\n\nSo it seems impossible to reach before T=29.\n\nThus minimal is T=29 with H=7 actions.\n\nBut in my first sequence, I reached at T=29 with actions from t=22 to t=28.\n\nH=7 actions.\n\nBut let's confirm the sequence.\n\nTurn 22: at y=4, action S, so y_{23}=4\n\nTurn 23: at y=4, action S, so y_{24}=4\n\nTurn 24: at y=4, action U, so y_{25}=5\n\nTurn 25: at y=5, action U, so y_{26}=6\n\nTurn 26: at y=6, action U, so y_{27}=7\n\nTurn 27: at y=7, action U, so y_{28}=8\n\nTurn 28: at y=8, action U, so y_{29}=9\n\nNow, check collisions:\n\nT=22: y=4, freeway 4 safe (not 27 or 28)\n\nT=23: y=4, freeway 4 safe\n\nT=24: y=4, freeway 4 safe\n\nT=25: y=5, freeway 5, T=25 not unsafe (unsafe 23,24,29,30), safe\n\nT=26: y=6, freeway 6, T=26 not unsafe, safe\n\nT=27: y=7, freeway 7, T=27 not unsafe (unsafe 23,24,29,30), safe\n\nT=28: y=8, freeway 8, T=28 not unsafe, safe\n\nT=29: y=9, safe, reached.\n\nNow, is there a way with H=6? As above, seems not.\n\nBut H=6 would be actions at t=22 to 27, y at t=28.\n\nBut y=9 at t=28 requires from y=4 to y=9 in 6 actions with net +5, so U=5, S=1 or U=6,D=1 etc., but U=6,D=1 means y=4+6-1=9, with K=7 actions if S=0, or more.\n\nU=6,D=1,S=0, K=7, y=4+6-1=9.\n\nBut K=7.\n\nWith K=6, U=5,S=1,D=0 or U=6,D=1,S=0 but U=6,D=1 requires K=7.\n\nOnly U=5,S=1,D=0 for K=6.\n\nThen y=4 +5 -0 =9 after 6 actions.\n\nBut as before, we cannot avoid collision at T=23 or 24 without being at y<=4, which requires not moving up early, but then we fall behind.\n\nFor example, if we do S at T=22, then y_{23}=4, then at T=23 we must do U to go up, but y_{24}=5, which at T=24 unsafe if we are on it.\n\nUnless we do S at a different time.\n\nSuppose we do U at T=22, but y_{23}=5, at T=23 collision immediately.\n\nNot possible.\n\nDo nothing at first, but same.\n\nSo impossible with H=6.\n\nThus minimal H=7.\n\nBut in the sequence above, we have two S at beginning, but we can have the stay later, but in this case, we need to wait until after T=24 to move up.\n\nAnother sequence: at T=22, we could move down to y=3, but then we need more up moves.\n\nFor example:\n\nT=22: action D, y_{23}=3\n\nT=23: at y=3, freeway 3, safe (since freeway 1-4 safe except 27,28). Action, say U, y_{24}=4\n\nT=24: at y=4, safe. Action U, y_{25}=5\n\nT=25: y=5, safe, action U, y_{26}=6\n\nT=26: y=6, safe, action U, y_{27}=7\n\nT=27: y=7, safe? T=27, freeway 7 unsafe? Freeway 7 unsafe at T=29,30? No, unsafe at 23,24,29,30, T=27 safe.\n\nAction U, y_{28}=8\n\nT=28: y=8, safe, action U, y_{29}=9\n\nSame as before, but we have one down and one up extra, so H=8 actions to reach at T=29, worse.\n\nNot better.\n\nSo the first sequence with two stays at beginning is better, H=7.\n\nBut in that sequence, we have actions S,S,U,U,U,U,U.\n\nNow, we can reduce the waiting if possible.\n\nNotice that at T=25,26,27,28, we can move up, but we are moving one per turn.\n\nSince freeways are safe except specific times, we could move faster, but we can only change by 1 per turn, so we have to go through each level.\n\nNo skip.\n\nSo I think H=7 is minimal.\n\nBut let's confirm the unsafe times for freeway 4 at later times.\n\nIn the sequence, at T=27 and 28, we are on higher freeways, not on freeway 4.\n\nFreeway 4 unsafe at T=27,28, but we are not there, so ok.\n\nSimilarly, for freeways 5-8, unsafe at T=29,30, but at T=29 we are at y=9, not on freeway.\n\nIn the sequence above, at T=29 we reach y=9.\n\nNow, the answer should be the sequence of actions.\n\nCurrent turn t_1=22.\n\nSequence from t=22 to t=22+H-1, with H=7, so t=22 to 28.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 22: S\n\nTurn 23: S\n\nTurn 24: U\n\nTurn 25: U\n\nTurn 26: U\n\nTurn 27: U\n\nTurn 28: U\n\nIn the sequence, after a28=U, at t=29, y=9.\n\nIn the action list, we have up to turn 28.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be actions from turn t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nHere t_1=22, H=7, so actions at turn 22 to 22+6=28.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, to write the answer.\n\nBut is there a shorter sequence?\n\nSuppose we move up immediately after, but we cannot.\n\nAnother idea: at T=22, we stay, y23=4\n\nThen at T=23, instead of stay, we move down to y=3, but then at T=24, y=3, then we move up to y=4 at T=25, etc., but then to reach y=9, it takes more turns.\n\nFor example, y at T=24:3, T=25:4, T=26:5, T=27:6, T=28:7, T=29:8, T=30:9, later.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo not better.\n\nPerhaps we can be on freeways 5-8 at T=25 or later, which is safe until T=29.\n\nBut we need to get there after T=24.\n\nIn the sequence, we start moving up at T=24 to y25=5.\n\nWe could start earlier, but cannot because of T=23 and 24.\n\nUnless we go to y=9 directly, but no.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nBut in the sequence, at T=27, we are at y=7, and freeway 7 is safe, but later at T=29,30 unsafe, but we are not there then.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo the sequence should be ok.\n\nNow, to output.\n\nBut the player needs to reach (0,9), which is done at turn 29.\n\nIn the answer, we list actions from turn 22 to 28.\n\nNow, in the car state, for freeways 5-8, there is a car at (-6,-17,right,6) which covers T=23,24, but we avoided.\n\nIn the sequence, we have two S at start, but we could have only one if we do something else, but not possible.\n\nPerhaps at T=22, we do nothing, same.\n\nSo I think it's minimal.\n\nBut let's see if we can reach at T=28 with different approach.\n\nSuppose we go down to y=0 or something, but that takes more time.\n\nNo.\n\nSo H=7 is minimal.\n\nThus the sequence:\n\nTurn 22: S\n\nTurn 23: S\n\nTurn 24: U\n\nTurn 25: U\n\nTurn 26: U\n\nTurn 27: U\n\nTurn 28: U\n\nIn the action, at turn 28: U to go to y=9 at turn 29.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, in the answer format.\n\nAlso, for freeway 4, at T=27,28 unsafe, but we are not on it, so ok.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n</think>\nThe goal is to reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 4) at turn \\(t_1 = 22\\) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\), avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis of Unsafe Times\n- Freeways 1 to 4 are unsafe at turns \\(T = 27\\) and \\(T = 28\\) due to cars covering \\(x = 0\\).\n- Freeways 5 to 8 are unsafe at turns \\(T = 23\\), \\(T = 24\\), \\(T = 29\\), and \\(T = 30\\) due to cars covering \\(x = 0\\).\n- At all other times, the freeways are safe.\n- Positions \\(y = 0\\) and \\(y = 9\\) have no cars and are always safe.\n\n### Strategy\n- The player starts at \\(y = 4\\) at turn \\(T = 22\\), which is safe for freeway 4.\n- Turns \\(T = 23\\) and \\(T = 24\\) are unsafe for freeways 5 to 8, so the player must avoid being on \\(y = 5\\) to \\(8\\) at these times.\n- To avoid collision, the player stays at \\(y = 4\\) for turns \\(T = 23\\) and \\(T = 24\\) by choosing the \"S\" (stay) action at turns 22 and 23.\n- After \\(T = 24\\), the player moves up (\"U\") each turn to reach \\(y = 9\\) as quickly as possible, as freeways 5 to 8 are safe from \\(T = 25\\) to \\(T = 28\\) (except \\(T = 29\\) and \\(T = 30\\), but the player reaches \\(y = 9\\) before then).\n\n### Sequence of Actions (Minimal \\(H = 7\\))\n- **Turn 22 (current turn)**: Start at \\(y = 4\\). Action \"S\" keeps the player at \\(y = 4\\) for turn 23, avoiding freeways 5-8 at \\(T = 23\\).\n- **Turn 23**: At \\(y = 4\\) (safe). Action \"S\" keeps the player at \\(y = 4\\) for turn 24, avoiding freeways 5-8 at \\(T = 24\\).\n- **Turn 24**: At \\(y = 4\\) (safe). Action \"U\" moves to \\(y = 5\\) for turn 25. Freeway 5 is safe at \\(T = 25\\).\n- **Turn 25**: At \\(y = 5\\) (safe). Action \"U\" moves to \\(y = 6\\) for turn 26. Freeway 6 is safe at \\(T = 26\\).\n- **Turn 26**: At \\(y = 6\\) (safe). Action \"U\" moves to \\(y = 7\\) for turn 27. Freeway 7 is safe at \\(T = 27\\).\n- **Turn 27**: At \\(y = 7\\) (safe). Action \"U\" moves to \\(y = 8\\) for turn 28. Freeway 8 is safe at \\(T = 28\\).\n- **Turn 28**: At \\(y = 8\\) (safe). Action \"U\" moves to \\(y = 9\\) for turn 29, reaching the goal safely.\n\n### Verification\n- Collision is checked at each turn based on the player's \\(y\\)-position and car spans at that turn:\n  - Turn 22: \\(y = 4\\), freeway 4 safe (not unsafe at \\(T = 22\\)).\n  - Turn 23: \\(y = 4\\), freeway 4 safe (not unsafe at \\(T = 23\\)).\n  - Turn 24: \\(y = 4\\), freeway 4 safe (not unsafe at \\(T = 24\\)).\n  - Turn 25: \\(y = 5\\), freeway 5 safe (not unsafe at \\(T = 25\\)).\n  - Turn 26: \\(y = 6\\), freeway 6 safe (not unsafe at \\(T = 26\\)).\n  - Turn 27: \\(y = 7\\), freeway 7 safe (not unsafe at \\(T = 27\\)).\n  - Turn 28: \\(y = 8\\), freeway 8 safe (not unsafe at \\(T = 28\\)).\n- The player reaches \\(y = 9\\) at turn 29, which is safe with no cars.\n\nThis sequence achieves the goal in \\(H = 7\\) actions, which is minimal because:\n- A direct path upward in 5 actions (turns 22 to 26) would collide at turns 23 or 24.\n- Paths with fewer than 7 actions (e.g., 6 actions) cannot reach \\(y = 9\\) by turn 28 without colliding or failing to increase \\(y\\) sufficiently.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 22: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 23: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 24: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 25: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 26: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 27: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 28: \\text{ U} \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,4) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The player can move up, down, or stay each turn, changing y by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars are on each freeway, and they move left or right with a certain speed. Collision happens only if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T and 0 is within the span of a car on that freeway at that turn.\n\nThe key point is that when you move to a new y, you're not on that y until the next turn. So if you move from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T you're still on y, and you arrive at y+1 at turn T+1. So you only check for collision on the freeway you're currently on at the start of the turn.\n\nLet me denote the current turn as t_1 = 23.\n\nPlayer starts at y = 4.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nThe minimal H might be 5, since from 4 to 9 is 5 steps up, but I have to avoid the cars on y=5 to y=8 during the turns when I'm on those rows.\n\ny=9 is the goal, and it's not a freeway, so no cars there. Freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, I assume.\n\ny=0 is the starting point, and y=9 is the target.\n\nNow, let's look at the car states.\n\nAll freeways have similar cars, but y=5 to 8 have an extra car.\n\nLet me list for each freeway the cars and their positions at turn t_1=23.\n\nFirst, for freeway k=1 to 4:\n\nTwo cars: (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\n\nBoth are (42,31, right, 6) and (-24,-35, right, 6)\n\nDirection is right, which means they are moving right? Let's see the update rule.\n\nFor right-moving: span at T is [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nSince they are moving right, head is larger, I think.\n\nIn the span notation, for right-moving, it says [τ, h] with τ < h, I assume.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, [h, τ] with h < τ.\n\nIn this case, both cars have head and tail, and direction right.\n\nFor the first car: (42,31, right, 6)\n\nBut 42 and 31, if direction is right, and it says [τ, h] for right-moving at t_1, so τ should be tail, h head, so if moving right, tail is left, head is right, so τ < h.\n\nBut here for (42,31), 42 > 31, so if direction right, τ=31, h=42? But in the list it says (head h, tail τ), so head=42, tail=31.\n\nBut for right-moving, at t_1, span is [τ, h] = [31,42], I think.\n\nSimilarly, the second car (-24,-35, right,6), head=-24, tail=-35, since -24 > -35, so [τ, h] = [-35, -24] at t_1.\n\nNow for freeways 5 to 8, three cars: (42,31,right,6), (-36,-47,right,6), and (0,-11,right,6)\n\n(0,-11,right,6) at t_1.\n\nNow, since all cars are moving right, and speed 6, which is fast.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if for the freeway y_T, 0 is within some car's span at that turn.\n\nThe player is on y at turn T, so we need to check if 0 is in the span of any car on freeway y at turn T.\n\nNow, the span changes with time.\n\nLet me define the time from current turn.\n\nSet τ = T - t_1, so at τ=0, current turn.\n\nFor a car on freeway i, at time τ (after t_1), the position.\n\nSince all cars moving right, span at time τ is [τ_i + s τ, h_i + s τ] for each car, where s=6 for all.\n\ns is speed, which is 6 for all cars.\n\nNow, for a specific freeway, we have multiple cars.\n\nI need to find for each freeway, for which τ, 0 is covered by some car on that freeway.\n\nThat is, when there exists a car on that freeway such that low(τ) <= 0 <= high(τ), where [low, high] is the span at time τ.\n\nSince the cars are moving, the span is shifting right with speed 6 per turn.\n\nLet me list for each freeway the initial spans at τ=0.\n\nFreeway 1 to 4:\n\nCar A: [τ, h] = [31,42] for the first one? Head=42, tail=31, direction right, so at τ=0, span is [tail, head] = [31,42]? No.\n\nFrom the update rule:\n\nFor right-moving, at time T, span is [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nAt T=t_1, s(T-t_1)=0, so [τ, h]\n\nAnd since direction right, τ is tail (left end), h is head (right end), so τ < h.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but here all are right-moving.\n\nSo for car (head h, tail τ, right, s), at time τ (after t_1), span is [τ + s τ, h + s τ]? Let's use t for time offset.\n\nSet t = T - t_1, so t=0 at current turn.\n\nAt time t, span for a car is:\n\nIf right-moving: [τ + s t, h + s t]\n\nIf left-moving: [h - s t, τ - s t], but here all right.\n\nSo for freeway 1 to 4:\n\nFirst car: head=42, tail=31, s=6, so span at time t: [31 + 6t, 42 + 6t]\n\nSecond car: head=-24, tail=-35, s=6, span at time t: [-35 + 6t, -24 + 6t]\n\nSimilarly for freeway 5 to 8:\n\nFirst car: same as above, [31 + 6t, 42 + 6t]\n\nSecond car: head=-36, tail=-47, s=6, span: [-47 + 6t, -36 + 6t]\n\nThird car: head=0, tail=-11, s=6, span: [-11 + 6t, 0 + 6t] = [-11 + 6t, 6t]\n\nNow, for each freeway, we need to find when 0 is covered, i.e., for some car, low(t) <= 0 <= high(t)\n\nThen at that time t, if player is on that freeway, collision.\n\nBut we need to know for each freeway, the times when it is occupied at x=0.\n\nSince x=0 is the player's path.\n\nPlayer is always at x=0, moving vertically.\n\nSo for each freeway y, we need the set of t where min over cars of low(t) <= 0 <= high(t) for some car on y.\n\nThat is, the freeway is blocked at time t if 0 is in some car's span.\n\nOtherwise, it is safe at time t.\n\nThen the player can be on that freeway only when it is safe.\n\nNow, since the player moves at most one y per turn, we need to plan the path.\n\nFirst, let's find for each y from 1 to 8, for which t it is safe.\n\nStart with y=1 to 4, since they have two cars.\n\nFor freeway 1 (and similarly 2,3,4):\n\nCars: [31 + 6t, 42 + 6t] and [-35 + 6t, -24 + 6t]\n\n0 in first car: 31 + 6t <= 0 <= 42 + 6t\n\nSince 31+6t <=0 and 0<=42+6t, but 42+6t is always positive for t>=0, since t=0, 42>0. 31+6t <=0 implies 6t <= -31, t <= -31/6 ≈ -5.166, but t>=0, so never true. Similarly, 0<=42+6t always true for t>=0, but the inequality requires both, so since 31+6t <=0 never for t>=0, so 0 not in first car for t>=0.\n\nSimilarly, second car: -35 + 6t <= 0 <= -24 + 6t\n\nSo -35 + 6t <= 0 and 0 <= -24 + 6t\n\nFirst: -35 + 6t <= 0 => 6t <= 35 => t <= 35/6 ≈ 5.833\n\nSecond: 0 <= -24 + 6t => 6t >= 24 => t >= 4\n\nSo for t in [4, 5.833], so t=4,5 since t integer? t is turn offset, integer.\n\nt=0,1,2,... integer.\n\nSo t=4 and t=5, 0 is in second car.\n\nt=4: low = -35 + 24 = -11, high = -24 + 24 = 0? Let's compute.\n\nAt t=4: -35 + 6*4 = -35 + 24 = -11\n\n-24 + 24 = 0\n\nSo span [-11, 0], so 0 is included, since high=0.\n\nSimilarly, t=5: -35 + 30 = -5, -24 + 30 = 6, span [-5,6], 0 in it.\n\nt=6: -35 + 36 =1, -24 + 36=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nt=3: -35 + 18 = -17, -24 + 18 = -6, [-17,-6], all negative, 0 not in.\n\nSo for freeway 1, occupied at t=4 and t=5.\n\nSimilarly for y=2,3,4, same cars, so same: occupied at t=4,5.\n\nNow freeway 5 to 8:\n\nCars: first same as before, [31+6t,42+6t], which never covers 0 for t>=0.\n\nSecond car: head=-36, tail=-47, so span at t: [-47 +6t, -36 +6t]\n\nThird car: [ -11 +6t, 0 +6t] = [-11+6t, 6t]\n\nNow, 0 in second car: -47 +6t <= 0 <= -36 +6t\n\nSo -47+6t <=0 => 6t <=47 => t <= 47/6 ≈7.833\n\n0 <= -36 +6t => 6t >=36 => t>=6\n\nSo t from 6 to 7.833, so t=6,7\n\nAt t=6: -47 +36 = -11, -36 +36=0, span [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nt=7: -47+42= -5, -36+42=6, span [-5,6], 0 in.\n\nt=8: -47+48=1, -36+48=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nNow third car: [-11+6t, 6t]\n\n0 in this: -11+6t <=0 <=6t\n\nFirst: -11+6t <=0 => 6t <=11 => t <= 11/6 ≈1.833\n\nSecond: 0 <=6t always for t>=0.\n\nBut t<=1.833, so t=0,1\n\nAt t=0: [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nt=1: -11+6=-5, 6*1=6, [-5,6], 0 in.\n\nt=2: -11+12=1, 12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo for freeway 5 to 8, we have:\n\nFrom third car, occupied at t=0 and t=1\n\nFrom second car, occupied at t=6 and t=7\n\nFirst car never.\n\nSo occupied at t=0,1 and t=6,7.\n\nt=0: occupied by third car.\n\nt=1: occupied by third car.\n\nt=6: occupied by second car.\n\nt=7: occupied by second car.\n\nAnd other times free, I think.\n\nFor example t=2: no car covers 0? Third car at t=2: [1,12], 0 not in. Second car: at t=2, -47+12=-35, -36+12=-24, [-35,-24], negative. First car [31+12=43,42+12=54? Wait [31+12,42+12]=[43,54], positive, 0 not in. So free.\n\nSimilarly, t=3: similar, all not cover 0.\n\nt=4: second car: -47+24=-23, -36+24=-12, [-23,-12], negative. Third car: [-11+24=13,24], positive. First car [31+24=55,42+24=66], positive. So free.\n\nt=5: second car: -47+30=-17, -36+30=-6, [-17,-6], negative. Third: [-11+30=19,30], pos. First: [55,66]? [31+30=61,42+30=72], pos. Free.\n\nt=6: second car covers, as above.\n\nSo for y=5 to 8, occupied at t=0,1,6,7.\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway:\n\ny=1: occupied t=4,5\n\ny=2: same as y=1, occupied t=4,5\n\ny=3: same, t=4,5\n\ny=4: same, t=4,5\n\ny=5: occupied t=0,1,6,7\n\ny=6: same, t=0,1,6,7\n\ny=7: same, t=0,1,6,7\n\ny=8: same, t=0,1,6,7\n\nPlayer starts at y=4 at t=0 (turn t_1=23).\n\nt=0 is current turn, player at y=4.\n\nAt t=0, player is on y=4.\n\nNow, y=4 is freeway, and at t=0, is it occupied?\n\nFor y=4, which is from 1-4 group, occupied at t=4,5 only.\n\nt=0, y=4 is free, since occupied only at t=4,5.\n\nSimilarly, y=5 to 8 occupied at t=0,1,6,7.\n\nSo at t=0, player on y=4, which is free, no collision.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\ny=9 is not a freeway, so safe.\n\nNow, the path: from y=4 to y=9, we need to go through y=5,6,7,8.\n\nBut we can stay or move up/down, but since we want minimal turns, probably move up directly.\n\nBut we have to avoid being on a freeway when it is occupied.\n\nThe player position at time t.\n\nLet y_t be the y-position at time t, where t is offset from current, so t=0: y=4\n\nt=1: y depends on action at t=0\n\netc.\n\nCollision at time t if y_t is between 1 and 8, and freeway y_t is occupied at time t.\n\nFor y_t to be safe, either y_t not in 1-8, or if in, not occupied at time t.\n\nSince we start at y=4 and want to go to y=9, we will be on freeways only during transition.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe.\n\nNow, minimal H: from y=4 to y=9, if we go up every turn, it takes 5 turns: after 5 actions, at t=5, y=9.\n\nt=0: start y=4\n\nAfter action a_t at time t, y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\n\nAt time t, player is at y_t, and we check collision based on y_t and time t.\n\nThen we choose action, which affects y_{t+1}.\n\nAfter H actions, at time t=H, y_H should be 9.\n\nTime: let’s index the position at time t.\n\nAt time t=0 (turn t_1=23), position y=4\n\nAfter action a_0, at time t=1, position y_1 = y_0 + Δy_0\n\nSimilarly, at time t, position y_t.\n\nWe need y_H = 9 for some H.\n\nCollision at time t if 1 <= y_t <=8 and freeway y_t is occupied at time t.\n\nNow, for each freeway, we have the unsafe times.\n\ny=1: unsafe at t=4,5\n\ny=2: unsafe t=4,5\n\ny=3: unsafe t=4,5\n\ny=4: unsafe t=4,5\n\ny=5: unsafe t=0,1,6,7\n\ny=6: unsafe t=0,1,6,7\n\ny=7: unsafe t=0,1,6,7\n\ny=8: unsafe t=0,1,6,7\n\nNow, player at t=0: y=4, which is safe since t=0 not in {4,5} for y=4.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nThe direct path: move up each turn.\n\nBut let's see when we would be on which y.\n\nt=0: y=4, safe\n\nAction a_0: if U, then y_1 =5\n\nIf S, y_1=4, etc.\n\nWe want minimal H, so probably U as much as possible.\n\nSuppose we always go up when possible.\n\nStart t=0: y=4, safe. Go U, so y_1=5\n\nt=1: y=5\n\nNow, at t=1, y=5, which is freeway, and for y=5, unsafe at t=0,1,6,7. t=1 is unsafe.\n\nSo at t=1, if y=5, collision!\n\nBecause y=5 occupied at t=1.\n\nSimilarly, if we go to y=5 at t=1, collision.\n\nBut at t=0, we are at y=4, if we go up to y=5 at t=1.\n\nAt time t=1, position y_1=5, so we check freeway y=5 at time t=1.\n\ny=5 is unsafe at t=1, so collision.\n\nSo we cannot go directly to y=5 at t=1.\n\nWe need to avoid being on y=5 at t=1.\n\nSimilarly, at t=0, if we stay, y_1=4, then at t=1, y=4, which is safe, since y=4 unsafe only at t=4,5, not t=1.\n\nt=1, y=4 safe.\n\nThen from there, we can go up later.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9.\n\ny=5 is unsafe at t=0,1,6,7\n\nt=0 and t=1 are early, t=6,7 later.\n\nSimilarly for y=6,7,8 same unsafe times.\n\nNow, we can be on y=5 only when it is safe, i.e., t not in {0,1,6,7}, so t=2,3,4,5,8,... but since we want minimal time, probably earlier.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSince y=5 to 8 are unsafe at t=0,1, we cannot be on them at t=0 or t=1.\n\nAt t=0, we are on y=4, which is safe.\n\nAt t=1, if we go to y=5, unsafe; if stay, y=4 safe; if down, to y=3, but y=3 is freeway, and unsafe at t=4,5, not t=1, so safe, but going down might not help.\n\nTo minimize turns, we should not go down.\n\nSo at t=0, we can only stay or go down? But go down to y=3.\n\ny=3 at t=1: y=3 unsafe at t=4,5, not t=1, so safe.\n\nBut then we are at y=3, which is farther from 9.\n\nSimilarly, we can stay at y=4 for some turns.\n\nBut let's think about the times when we can cross the dangerous rows.\n\nFirst, y=5 to 8 are safe only when t not in {0,1,6,7}, so for t=2,3,4,5,8,9,...\n\nSimilarly, y=4 is safe except t=4,5.\n\ny=1,2,3 similar to y=4.\n\nNow, to go from y=4 to y=9, we need to pass through y=5,6,7,8.\n\nEach step to next y takes one turn.\n\nWe can stay or move vertically.\n\nBut to reach y=9 fast, we should move up when possible.\n\nThe constraining points are y=5 to 8, which cannot be occupied at t=0,1.\n\nSince we start at t=0 on y=4, we can stay at y=4 for a few turns until it is safe to go up.\n\ny=5 is safe at t=2,3,4,5? t=2,3,4,5 are safe for y=5? y=5 unsafe at t=0,1,6,7, so safe at t=2,3,4,5,8,9,...\n\nSimilarly for y=6,7,8.\n\nBut y=4 is unsafe at t=4,5.\n\nNow, let's list the safe times for each:\n\ny=4: safe t=0,1,2,3,6,7,... except t=4,5\n\ny=5: safe t=2,3,4,5,8,9,... except t=0,1,6,7\n\ny=6: same as y=5\n\ny=7: same\n\ny=8: same\n\nWe start at t=0, y=4.\n\nWe need to be at y=9 at some t=H.\n\nSince y=9 is safe always.\n\nThe player can only change y by one per turn, so to go from 4 to 9, we need at least 5 moves up.\n\nBut we might need to stay or wait sometimes.\n\nEach move up increases y by one.\n\nLet k be the number of up moves, then we need k=5 to reach y=9 from y=4.\n\nBut we might have stay or down moves, which increase time but not position.\n\nTo minimize H, we should minimize the number of non-up moves, so ideally no down or stay, but we may need to stay to avoid collision.\n\nH is the number of turns including actions, so after H actions, at time H, we are at position.\n\nAt time t=0, after 0 actions, y=4.\n\nAfter first action, at t=1, y_1.\n\nAfter H actions, at time t=H, y_H.\n\nWe need y_H =9.\n\nThe minimal H is at least 5, if we can go up each time without collision.\n\nBut as we saw, if we go up at t=0, to y=5 at t=1, but at t=1, y=5 is unsafe.\n\nIf we stay at t=0, then at t=1, y=4, which is safe.\n\nThen at t=1, we can go up to y=5 at t=2.\n\nAt t=2, y=5 is safe, since t=2 not in {0,1,6,7} for y=5.\n\nSimilarly, then we can go up to y=6 at t=3.\n\nt=3, y=6: y=6 unsafe at t=0,1,6,7, so t=3 safe.\n\nThen to y=7 at t=4.\n\nt=4, y=7: unsafe at t=6,7? t=4 not in, so safe? y=7 unsafe at t=0,1,6,7, so t=4 safe.\n\nThen to y=8 at t=5.\n\nt=5, y=8: unsafe at t=0,1,6,7, t=5 not in, so safe.\n\nThen to y=9 at t=6.\n\nt=6, y=9, which is safe, not freeway.\n\nNow, check for collision during the path.\n\nt=0: y=4, safe as established.\n\nAction: we need to choose actions.\n\nAt t=0: we start at y=4.\n\nIf we do S (stay), then at t=1, y=4.\n\nIf U, at t=1, y=5, but unsafe.\n\nIn the path above, we stay at t=0.\n\nThen at t=1, y=4, safe.\n\nThen at t=1, we do U, so y_2 = y_1 + Δy, at t=1, action a_1, y_{2} = y_1 + Δy_1\n\nSet t=0: y=4\n\nAction a_0: let's say S (stay), so y_1 =4\n\nt=1: y=4, safe.\n\nAction a_1: U, so y_2 =5\n\nt=2: y=5, now check: y=5 at t=2, safe? y=5 unsafe at t=0,1,6,7, t=2 not in, so safe.\n\nAction a_2: U, y_3=6\n\nt=3: y=6, safe? t=3, not unsafe times, safe.\n\nAction a_3: U, y_4=7\n\nt=4: y=7, safe? t=4, not 0,1,6,7, so safe.\n\nAction a_4: U, y_5=8\n\nt=5: y=8, safe? t=5, not 0,1,6,7, so safe.\n\nAction a_5: U, y_6=9\n\nt=6: y=9, safe.\n\nSo we reached at t=6.\n\nH=6 turns? Let's see the number of actions.\n\nFrom t=0 to t=6, we have 6 actions: a_0 to a_5.\n\nAt time t=0, before action, position.\n\nAfter H actions, at time H, position.\n\nSequence: actions from t=0 to H-1, position at time t after t actions? Let's clarify.\n\nDefine:\n\n- At time t (turn t_1 + t), position is y_t\n\n- Action a_t is taken at time t, which determines y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\n\n- Collision checked at time t based on y_t\n\nIn the sequence, for t from 0 to H-1, actions a_t, and at time H, y_H =9.\n\nIn this case, with actions:\n\nt=0: position y=4, safe. Action a_0 = S (stay), so y_1 =4\n\nt=1: position y=4, safe. Action a_1 = U, so y_2=5\n\nt=2: position y=5, safe. Action a_2 = U, so y_3=6\n\nt=3: position y=6, safe. Action a_3 = U, so y_4=7\n\nt=4: position y=7, safe. Action a_4 = U, so y_5=8\n\nt=5: position y=8, safe. Action a_5 = U, so y_6=9\n\nt=6: position y=9, done.\n\nSo H=6, with actions from t=0 to t=5.\n\nBut is there a way with H=5?\n\nH=5 would mean after 5 actions, at time t=5, y_5=9.\n\nTo reach y=9 from y=4 in 5 steps, we need all actions U, no stay or down.\n\nSo sequence: a_0=U, a_1=U, a_2=U, a_3=U, a_4=U\n\nThen positions:\n\nt=0: y=4, safe\n\nAfter a_0=U, y_1=5\n\nt=1: y=5, but y=5 at t=1 is unsafe, collision! Cannot.\n\nIf we do something else, but with all U, we must have at t=1 y=5, which is unsafe.\n\nPerhaps start with down or something, but that would take more time or not help.\n\nFor example, at t=0, go down to y=3, but then y_1=3, at t=1 y=3 which is safe, but then we need to go up to 4,5,etc, which takes more steps.\n\nSimilarly, staying at some point.\n\nBut to reach in 5 turns, we need to be at y=9 at t=5.\n\nWith 5 up moves, but as above, at t=1 y=5 unsafe.\n\nUnless we can be on y=5 at a safe time.\n\nBut y=5 safe only at t=2,3,4,5.\n\nt=1 is unsafe.\n\nIn the all-up path, at t=1 we are on y=5, which is t=1 unsafe.\n\nIf we delay the move.\n\nSuppose at t=0, we stay, so y_1=4\n\nThen at t=1, y=4, we go up, y_2=5 at t=2.\n\nThen we need to reach y=9 at t=5.\n\nFrom t=2, y=5, we need to go to y=9 in 3 steps: so to y=6 at t=3, y=7 at t=4, y=8 at t=5, y=9 at t=6? Let's see.\n\nAfter action at t=2, y_3, etc.\n\nt=2: position y=5, after action.\n\nTo have y_5=9.\n\ny_5=9.\n\nNow, from y at t=0:4\n\nAfter actions:\n\nSuppose a_0 = S, so y_1=4\n\na_1 = U, so y_2=5\n\na_2 = U, so y_3=6\n\na_3 = U, so y_4=7\n\na_4 = U, so y_5=8\n\nThen y_5=8, not 9.\n\nTo reach y=9 at t=5, we need y_5=9.\n\nSo from y_0=4, after 5 actions, y_5=9, so we need 5 up moves, no other actions.\n\nBut with 5 up moves: y_1=5, y_2=6, y_3=7, y_4=8, y_5=9\n\nNow check collision:\n\nt=0: y=4, safe\n\nt=1: y=5, unsafe (t=1), collision\n\nCannot.\n\nIf we go up later, but with 5 actions, we must have positions at t=1,2,3,4.\n\ny at t=1 must be 5 or less, but to reach 9 in 4 more steps, if y_1=5, then y_2=6, y_3=7, y_4=8, y_5=9, same as above.\n\nIf at t=1 we are lower, say y_1=3, then we need to go up faster, but we can only increase by one per step, so from y_1=3, to y_5=9, need 6 increases, but only 4 actions from a_1 to a_4? Actions a_1 to a_4 determine y_2 to y_5.\n\ny_1 is after a_0.\n\ny_0=4\n\nAfter a_0, y_1\n\nAfter a_1, y_2\n\n...\n\nAfter a_4, y_5\n\ny_5=9\n\ny_0=4, so net change +5, so must have 5 up moves, no down, and stays don't help, so exactly 5 up moves, no other actions.\n\nThus the positions are fixed: y_t for t=0 to 5: y_0=4, y_1=5, y_2=6, y_3=7, y_4=8, y_5=9\n\nNow check collision:\n\nt=0: y=4, safe\n\nt=1: y=5, but y=5 at t=1 unsafe, collision\n\nt=2: y=6, y=6 at t=2: safe? t=2 not unsafe for y=6, unsafe at 0,1,6,7, so t=2 safe\n\nBut t=1 already collision.\n\nSo impossible to reach in 5 turns without collision.\n\nThus minimal H is 6.\n\nIn the earlier path with 6 turns, it worked with one stay.\n\nBut in that path, we had a stay at t=0.\n\nWe could have the stay later, but H=6 is minimal.\n\nIs there a way with H=5? Seems not.\n\nPerhaps go down first, but that would make it worse.\n\nSo H=6 is minimal.\n\nNow, in the path, we have actions: at t=0: S, then t=1: U, t=2: U, t=3: U, t=4: U, t=5: U\n\nIn terms of turn: current turn t_1=23.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn t_1 + 0 = turn 23: action a_{t_1} = S\n\nTurn t_1 + 1 = turn 24: action a_{t_1+1} = U\n\n...\n\nIn the sequence, we need actions for t from 0 to H-1.\n\nIn this case, H=6 actions? No.\n\nAfter H actions, at time H, position y_H.\n\nNumber of actions is H.\n\nFrom t=0 to t=H-1, actions a_t.\n\nIn the path:\n\nAction at time 0 (turn 23): S\n\nAction at time 1 (turn 24): U\n\nAction at time 2 (turn 25): U\n\nAction at time 3 (turn 26): U\n\nAction at time 4 (turn 27): U\n\nAction at time 5 (turn 28): U\n\nThen at time 6 (turn 29), y=9.\n\nBut we need to reach at some turn, so after action at time 5, y_6=9 at time 6.\n\nThe sequence has actions from t=0 to t=5, 6 actions.\n\nBut in the answer, it should be the actions to take.\n\nIn the minimal path, we have one stay and five ups.\n\nWe could have the stay at a different time.\n\nFor example, instead of staying at t=0, we could go up later.\n\nBut in this case, since we need to delay reaching y=5 until t=2.\n\nAnother possibility: at t=0, go up? But cannot, as before.\n\nPerhaps go to y=5 at t=5 or something.\n\nBut let's see the safe times.\n\ny=5 is safe at t=2,3,4,5\n\nSimilarly, we can be on y=5 at t=2,3,4,5.\n\nIn the path above, we are on y=5 at t=2.\n\nWe could be later, but that might take more time.\n\nSimilarly, for y=8, we need to be before going to 9.\n\nBut in this case, with H=6, it works.\n\nBut in the path, at t=4, we are on y=7.\n\nt=4, y=7: is it safe?\n\ny=7 unsafe at t=0,1,6,7, t=4 not in, so safe.\n\nt=5, y=8, safe.\n\nBut there is a potential issue at t=4 and t=5 for y=4.\n\nIn our path, at t=4, we are on y=7, not y=4.\n\ny=4 is unsafe at t=4,5, but we are not on it at those times.\n\nIn the path: t=0: y=4, t=1: y=4, t=2:y=5, t=3:y=6, t=4:y=7, t=5:y=8, t=6:y=9.\n\nAt t=4, y=7, not 4.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nWe could have a different sequence.\n\nFor example, at t=0, instead of stay, we could go down to y=3, but that would take more steps.\n\nFor instance: a_0=D, y_1=3\n\nt=1: y=3, safe (since y=3 unsafe only t=4,5, t=1 safe)\n\nThen a_1=U, y_2=4\n\nt=2: y=4, safe? t=2, y=4 unsafe at t=4,5, t=2 safe.\n\nThen a_2=U, y_3=5\n\nt=3: y=5, safe? t=3, y=5 unsafe at t=0,1,6,7, t=3 safe.\n\nThen a_3=U, y_4=6\n\nt=4: y=6, safe? t=4, y=6 unsafe at t=0,1,6,7, t=4 safe.\n\na_4=U, y_5=7\n\nt=5: y=7, safe? t=5 safe.\n\na_5=U, y_6=8\n\nt=6: y=8, safe? t=6, y=8 unsafe at t=6,7! Oh, t=6 is unsafe for y=8.\n\ny=8 unsafe at t=6,7.\n\nAt t=6, y=8, collision.\n\nThen we need to go to y=9, but at t=6, if we do U, y_7=9 at t=7.\n\nBut at t=6, collision on y=8.\n\nProblem.\n\nIn this sequence: after a_5=U at t=5, y_6=8 at t=6, but y=8 unsafe at t=6.\n\nCollision at t=6.\n\nIf at t=5, we are on y=7, and we do S, but y_6=7, then at t=6, y=7, which is unsafe at t=6? y=7 unsafe at t=6,7.\n\nt=6 unsafe.\n\nSo we cannot be on y=7 or 8 at t=6 or t=7.\n\nIn the first path, we were on y=8 at t=5, which is safe, and then to y=9 at t=6.\n\nt=5: y=8, safe.\n\nIn the down path, we ended up at t=6 on y=8, unsafe.\n\nBut in the first path, we avoided that.\n\nAnother sequence: suppose we stay at y=4 longer.\n\nFor example, at t=0: S, y_1=4\n\nt=1: y=4, safe, S again, y_2=4? But then we waste time.\n\nNot better.\n\nTo reach faster, but H=5 impossible, so H=6 is minimal.\n\nIn the first path, we have one stay at the beginning.\n\nWe could have the stay later, but not necessary.\n\nFor example, at t=0: U? Cannot.\n\nSuppose we go up to y=5 at t=2, as before.\n\nBut at t=4, we are on y=7.\n\ny=7 safe at t=4.\n\nBut if we could be faster, but no.\n\nAnother idea: since y=5 is safe at t=5, we can be on y=5 at t=5.\n\nBut then to reach y=9, it takes more time.\n\nFor example: start at t=0: y=4, safe, S or U? If U, to y=5 at t=1 unsafe.\n\nSo must stay or down.\n\nSuppose we stay at y=4 until t=1.\n\nt=0: S, y_1=4\n\nt=1: y=4, safe, now we can go U to y_2=5 at t=2.\n\nThen from there, we can go up each step.\n\nBut as before, y_2=5 at t=2, y_3=6 at t=3, y_4=7 at t=4, y_5=8 at t=5, y_6=9 at t=6.\n\nSame as before.\n\nIf we go faster, but cannot.\n\nAt t=2: y=5, we could do U to y_3=6, etc.\n\nBut at t=5, y=8, which is safe, since t=5 not unsafe.\n\nThen to y=9 at t=6.\n\nNow, what about y=4 at t=4 or t=5? We are not on it.\n\nIn the sequence, we are on y=4 only at t=0 and t=1.\n\nt=0 and t=1, y=4 is safe.\n\nt=4 and t=5, y=4 is unsafe, but we are not there.\n\nSimilarly, for y=5, we are at t=2, which is safe.\n\nt=6 and t=7 unsafe, but we are on y=8 at t=5, then to y=9.\n\ny=8 at t=5 safe.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, with H=6, it works.\n\nNow, the actions: at time t (offset):\n\nt=0: action S\n\nt=1: action U\n\nt=2: action U\n\nt=3: action U\n\nt=4: action U\n\nt=5: action U\n\nIn terms of turns:\n\nTurn t_1 + 0 = turn 23: action S\n\nTurn t_1 + 1 = turn 24: action U\n\nTurn t_1 + 2 = turn 25: action U\n\nTurn t_1 + 3 = turn 26: action U\n\nTurn t_1 + 4 = turn 27: action U\n\nTurn t_1 + 5 = turn 28: action U\n\nThen at turn 29, position (0,9)\n\nBut the sequence is for actions from t=0 to t=5.\n\nIn the answer format, it should list the actions starting from turn t_1.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 23: S\n\nTurn 24: U\n\nTurn 25: U\n\nTurn 26: U\n\nTurn 27: U\n\nTurn 28: U\n\nWith that, we reach (0,9) at turn 29.\n\nBut is there a shorter way? H=5 seems impossible.\n\nPerhaps we can go to y=9 earlier if we skip some, but no, we have to go through each y.\n\nAnother thought: we could go down to y=3 or something, but that would take more turns.\n\nFor example, if we go to y=3 at t=1, then to y=4 at t=2, etc., but from y=4 at t=2, then to y=5 at t=3, y=6 at t=4, y=7 at t=5, y=8 at t=6, y=9 at t=7, which is H=7, worse.\n\nSo not better.\n\nTherefore, the minimal is H=6 with one stay at the beginning.\n\nWe could have the stay at another point, but not necessary.\n\nFor example, suppose we go up at t=0 to y=5? Cannot.\n\nOr at t=1, if we are not on y=5.\n\nBut in the sequence, we have to have a stay somewhere to delay.\n\nSince y=5 to 8 are safe at t=2,3,4,5, we can be on them during those times.\n\nIn the path, we are on y=5 at t=2, y=6 at t=3, y=7 at t=4, y=8 at t=5, all within safe times.\n\nIf we are on y=5 at t=5, then we need to go to y=6,7,8,9, which takes to t=9, worse.\n\nSo best to be on the lower rows earlier.\n\nThus, the sequence is fine.\n\nNow, about the car on freeway 5-8 with head=0 at t_1.\n\nAt t=0, for y=5, the third car has span [-11,0], which includes 0, so occupied.\n\nSimilarly at t=1, [-5,6], includes 0.\n\nBut in our path, we are not on y=5 at t=0 or t=1.\n\nAt t=2, we are on y=5, and for y=5 at t=2, the cars: first car [31+12=43,42+12=54]? Span [31+6*2, 42+6*2]= [31+12,42+12]=[43,54], not cover 0.\n\nSecond car: [-47+12, -36+12]=[-35,-24], not.\n\nThird car: [-11+12, 12]=[1,12], not cover 0.\n\nSo safe.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, at t=4, we are on y=7.\n\ny=7 at t=4: cars same as y=5, since all freeways 5-8 have same cars? In the state, freeway 5,6,7,8 all have the same three cars.\n\nIn the table, it shows for each freeway k, the cars, and for k=5,6,7,8, all have (42,31,right,6), (-36,-47,right,6), (0,-11,right,6)\n\nSo yes, identical cars on each of y=5,6,7,8.\n\nSimilarly, y=1,2,3,4 have two cars each, same for all.\n\nSo the occupancy depends only on the row type, not the specific row, except that y=1-4 have different cars from y=5-8.\n\nBut within groups, same.\n\nSo our analysis is fine.\n\nTherefore, the minimal sequence is with 6 actions.\n\nNow, to write the answer.\n\nThe player starts at turn t_1=23, position (0,4).\n\nActions:\n\nAt turn 23: S\n\nAt turn 24: U\n\nAt turn 25: U\n\nAt turn 26: U\n\nAt turn 27: U\n\nAt turn 28: U\n\nThen at turn 29: (0,9)\n\nIn the sequence, we don't need to include the final position, just the actions up to reach.\n\nThe sequence should be the actions to take from turn t_1 onwards for H turns.\n\nIn the answer format: \\boxed{ ... } with lines for each turn.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 23: S\n\nTurn 24: U\n\nTurn 25: U\n\nTurn 26: U\n\nTurn 27: U\n\nTurn 28: U\n\nBut is this the minimal? H=6 turns of actions.\n\nPerhaps we can start with up later without stay.\n\nBut at t=0, if we do nothing, but we have to take action.\n\nAnother idea: since at t=0, we are on y=4, and it is safe, but if we go up, we go to y=5 at t=1 unsafe.\n\nBut we could go up at t=0, but then y_1=5, and at t=1 collision.\n\nUnless, but no.\n\nPerhaps move down to avoid, but no benefit.\n\nSo I think H=6 is minimal.\n\nBut let me confirm the time.\n\nCurrent turn t_1=23.\n\nAfter action at turn 23, position at turn 24.\n\nIn the dynamics: at turn T, position y_T, action a_T, then y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy_T.\n\nCollision at turn T if on freeway y_T and occupied.\n\nIn our case, for turn 23: y=4, safe, action S, so y_{24} =4\n\nTurn 24: y=4, safe, action U, so y_{25}=5\n\nTurn 25: y=5, which is freeway, at turn 25, time offset t=25-23=2, so t=2, y=5 safe, as above.\n\nThen action U, y_{26}=6\n\nTurn 26: y=6, t=26-23=3, y=6 safe, action U, y_{27}=7\n\nTurn 27: y=7, t=27-23=4, y=7 safe, action U, y_{28}=8\n\nTurn 28: y=8, t=28-23=5, y=8 safe (since unsafe t=6,7 which are t=29-23=6, t=30-23=7? t=5 is safe), action U, y_{29}=9\n\nTurn 29: y=9, done.\n\nAnd no collision.\n\nIf we try to go up at turn 23: action U, then y_{24}=5\n\nAt turn 24: position y=5, time offset t=24-23=1, so t=1, y=5 unsafe, collision.\n\nSo indeed, cannot.\n\nTherefore, the sequence must include a stay or delay.\n\nThus, minimal H=6.\n\nSo the answer should be as above.\n\nIn the sequence, we have actions from turn 23 to turn 28, that's 6 actions.\n\nBut turn 23 to 28 inclusive is 6 turns.\n\nIn the box.\n\nAlso, in the car state, for freeway 5-8, at t=0, the third car has head=0, tail=-11, so at t=0, span [-11,0], includes 0, occupied.\n\nBut we avoid that.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nSo I think that's the plan.\n</think>\nThe goal is to reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 4) at turn \\(t_1 = 23\\) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\), avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis of Car Occupancy\nThe cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 4\\) are identical and unsafe (i.e., a collision occurs if the player is on the freeway) at times \\(t = 4\\) and \\(t = 5\\) (where \\(t\\) is the time offset from \\(t_1\\), so \\(t = T - t_1\\)).  \nThe cars on freeways \\(y = 5\\) to \\(y = 8\\) are identical and unsafe at times \\(t = 0, 1, 6, 7\\).\n\n- **Freeways \\(y = 1, 2, 3, 4\\)**: Unsafe at \\(t = 4, 5\\) (safe at all other times).\n- **Freeways \\(y = 5, 6, 7, 8\\)**: Unsafe at \\(t = 0, 1, 6, 7\\) (safe at all other times).\n\nThe player starts at \\(y = 4\\) at \\(t = 0\\) (turn 23). To reach \\(y = 9\\) (which is not a freeway and always safe), the player must pass through freeways \\(y = 5\\) to \\(y = 8\\). The minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is determined as follows:\n- A direct upward path with 5 up actions would require positions: \\(y_{23} = 4\\), \\(y_{24} = 5\\), \\(y_{25} = 6\\), \\(y_{26} = 7\\), \\(y_{27} = 8\\), \\(y_{28} = 9\\). However, at \\(t = 1\\) (turn 24), \\(y = 5\\) is unsafe, leading to a collision. Thus, \\(H = 5\\) is impossible.\n- With \\(H = 6\\), the player can start by staying at \\(y = 4\\) for one turn to avoid being on \\(y = 5\\) at \\(t = 1\\). The sequence is:\n  - \\(t = 0\\) (turn 23): \\(y = 4\\) (safe), action Stay (S) → \\(y_{24} = 4\\).\n  - \\(t = 1\\) (turn 24): \\(y = 4\\) (safe), action Up (U) → \\(y_{25} = 5\\).\n  - \\(t = 2\\) (turn 25): \\(y = 5\\) (safe, as \\(t = 2\\) not unsafe for \\(y = 5\\)), action U → \\(y_{26} = 6\\).\n  - \\(t = 3\\) (turn 26): \\(y = 6\\) (safe, as \\(t = 3\\) not unsafe for \\(y = 6\\)), action U → \\(y_{27} = 7\\).\n  - \\(t = 4\\) (turn 27): \\(y = 7\\) (safe, as \\(t = 4\\) not unsafe for \\(y = 7\\)), action U → \\(y_{28} = 8\\).\n  - \\(t = 5\\) (turn 28): \\(y = 8\\) (safe, as \\(t = 5\\) not unsafe for \\(y = 8\\)), action U → \\(y_{29} = 9\\).\n- At \\(t = 6\\) (turn 29), \\(y = 9\\) is reached safely. No collisions occur, as all positions during the sequence are safe at their respective times.\n\nThis path achieves the goal in \\(H = 6\\) turns, which is minimal since \\(H = 5\\) is impossible.\n\n### Action Sequence\nThe actions are taken from turn \\(t_1 = 23\\) to turn \\(t_1 + 5 = 28\\) (6 actions), resulting in \\(y = 9\\) at turn 29.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 23: S \\\\\nTurn 24: U \\\\\nTurn 25: U \\\\\nTurn 26: U \\\\\nTurn 27: U \\\\\nTurn 28: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 24, and the player is at (0,4). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns, avoiding collisions.\n\nThe grid has freeways at y=1 to y=8. At each turn, the player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S). The vertical position is bounded between 0 and 9.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if the player is at position (0, y_T) and there is a car on freeway y_T that covers the x-coordinate 0 at that exact turn.\n\nImportant note: when moving from y_T to y_{T+1} at turn T, the player is only considered to be on freeway y_T during turn T. So if at turn T we are on freeway y_T and then we move to y_{T+1} at the same turn (meaning that at turn T we are on y_T and then at turn T+1 we are on y_{T+1}), then at turn T we must avoid the cars on y_T, but at the same turn T we are not on y_{T+1} so we don't worry about cars on y_{T+1} until we are actually on that row at a future turn.\n\nThe car update rules:\nFor a car on freeway i (which is one of the rows 1 to 8) at turn t1 (current turn) with head h, tail tau, direction d, and speed s:\n- If the car is left-moving, then the span at time T (>=t1) is [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)].\n  Note: the problem says for left-moving: span(t1) = [h, tau] -> becomes [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)].\n  But note that in the example the cars are given as (head, tail, direction, speed). For a left-moving car, typically the head is the front, which for left-moving would be the rightmost part? Actually, let's see the representation.\n\nHowever, looking at the data, all cars in the given state are right-moving. So we don't have any left-moving cars in this instance.\n\nFor a right-moving car:\n  The span at time t1 is [tau, h] (since the head is at h and tail at tau, and it's moving right, so the tail is the left end and head is the right end). Then at time T, the span becomes [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n\nSo for a right-moving car, at time T, the car occupies the interval [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if the player is at (0, y_T) and for some car on freeway y_T, 0 is in the interval [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)] (for a right-moving car).\n\nNow, the current state at turn t1=24:\n\nPlayer at y=4.\n\nCar state for each freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: two cars: \n  car1: (48,37,right,6) -> at t1=24: [37,48] (because tail=37, head=48, and moving right so tail is left, head is right). \n        But note: the representation says (head, tail) and then direction. So for right-moving, the head is the front (right end) and tail is the rear (left end). So the car spans from tail to head, i.e., [37,48] at turn 24.\n  car2: (-18,-29,right,6) -> at turn24: [-29,-18]\n\nFreeway 2: same as freeway1: two cars: [37,48] and [-29,-18]\n\nFreeway 3: same\n\nFreeway 4: same\n\nFreeway 5: three cars: \n  car1: (48,37,right,6) -> [37,48]\n  car2: (-30,-41,right,6) -> [-41,-30]\n  car3: (6,-5,right,6) -> [-5,6]\n\nFreeway 6: same as freeway5: [37,48], [-41,-30], [-5,6]\n\nFreeway 7: same\n\nFreeway 8: same\n\nOur goal is to go from y=4 to y=9. Since we start at y=4 and we can only move up, down, or stay, and we want to minimize turns, we would prefer moving up as much as possible. However, we must avoid collisions.\n\nNote that we are at turn 24 at y=4. We are not currently in a collision? We must check: at turn24, the player is at (0,4). On freeway4 (which is y=4) at turn24, we have two cars: \n  [37,48] and [-29,-18]. \nIs 0 in [37,48]? No. Is 0 in [-29,-18]? No. So we are safe at turn24.\n\nNow, we need to plan a sequence of actions to get to y=9 without colliding.\n\nThe minimal number of moves to go from 4 to 9 is 5 moves up (U). But we might have to wait (S) or even move down (D) to avoid cars.\n\nWe must check for each future turn T and for each freeway we might be on at that turn whether there is a car that covers 0.\n\nWe are going to simulate the moves and the car movements.\n\nLet me denote the current turn as t0 = 24. We are at turn t0: position y0 = 4.\n\nWe are going to consider the next turns: t = 24, 25, 26, ... until we get to y=9.\n\nBut note: the problem says we are to provide a sequence of actions starting at turn t1 (which is 24). So the first action is for turn24.\n\nHowever, note that at turn24 we are already at (0,4). The action at turn24 will determine where we are at turn25. But we are already at turn24 and we are safe. So we can choose an action for turn24 that might keep us at 4 or move to 5 or 3.\n\nBut we want to go to 9. So moving up is preferred.\n\nLet me compute the positions of the cars at future turns.\n\nFirst, note that the cars move at speed 6 per turn. So for a right-moving car, the entire car moves right by 6 per turn.\n\nWe are going to consider the freeways we might step on: from y=4 to y=9, we will be traversing freeways 5,6,7,8 and then goal at y=9 (which is not a freeway).\n\nBut note: when we are at y=9, we don't have to worry about cars because there are no freeways above 8. However, to get to 9 we must be at 8 at some turn and then move up to 9. But at the turn when we are at 8, we must avoid the cars on freeway8.\n\nAlso, we might pass through freeway5,6,7,8.\n\nNow, let me write the car positions at turn T (relative to t0=24, so T = 24,25,26,...) for the freeways we care about: 5,6,7,8.\n\nBut note: we start at 4. We can move to 5 at the next turn (if we choose U at turn24) and then we are at freeway5 at turn25? Actually:\n\n- At turn24: we are at y=4. We choose an action a24. \n  - If a24 = U, then at turn25 we are at y=5.\n  - If a24 = S, then at turn25 we are still at y=4.\n  - If a24 = D, then at turn25 we are at y=3.\n\nWe want to avoid being at a freeway at a turn when 0 is covered by a car on that freeway.\n\nSo for each freeway and each turn T, we can compute the car intervals and check if 0 is in any of them.\n\nLet me compute for freeway5 (y=5) at turns T>=24:\n\nFreeway5 has three cars at t0=24:\n  car1: [37,48] -> at T: [37 + 6*(T-24), 48 + 6*(T-24)]\n  car2: [-41,-30] -> at T: [-41 + 6*(T-24), -30 + 6*(T-24)]\n  car3: [-5,6] -> at T: [-5 + 6*(T-24), 6 + 6*(T-24)]\n\nSimilarly for freeway6,7,8: same set of cars? Actually, the table says freeway5,6,7,8 all have the same set: three cars: (48,37,right,6), (-30,-41,right,6), (6,-5,right,6). But note the representation: for the third car, it's (6,-5,right,6). That means at t0=24, it's [-5,6]. So:\n\nFreeway5,6,7,8 at turn T (>=24) have:\n  car1: [37 + 6*(T-24), 48 + 6*(T-24)]\n  car2: [-41 + 6*(T-24), -30 + 6*(T-24)]\n  car3: [-5 + 6*(T-24), 6 + 6*(T-24)]\n\nWe need to check for which T and which freeway (if we are on that freeway at turn T) we would collide.\n\nBut note: the freeways are independent. However, the same car pattern is on freeways 5,6,7,8. So the set of dangerous turns for each of these freeways is the same? Actually, yes, because the cars are identical on each. So if we are on freeway5 at turn T, we must avoid the same intervals as if we are on freeway6 at turn T? But wait, the freeway number doesn't matter for the car positions? Actually, the cars are per freeway. But in this case, each freeway has the same set of cars. So the danger condition for a freeway row is the same for rows 5,6,7,8.\n\nTherefore, if we are on any of the rows 5,6,7,8 at turn T, we are in danger if at least one of the three intervals on that row contains 0.\n\nBut note: the freeway number is fixed for the row, but the cars are defined per row. Since the cars on row5 are independent of row6, but in this instance, they are identical. So the condition for row5 at turn T is the same as for row6 at turn T? Actually, yes, because the car parameters are the same.\n\nTherefore, the set of dangerous turns is the same for every row in {5,6,7,8}. So if we are on row5 at turn T, it's dangerous if 0 is in one of the three intervals. Same for row6,7,8 at turn T.\n\nSo we can compute the set of T (starting from 24) for which 0 is in one of the three intervals for a particular freeway (say freeway5). And that set of T will be dangerous for any freeway in {5,6,7,8} at that turn.\n\nBut note: we might be on different freeways at different turns, but the danger condition per turn T is independent of the row? Actually, no: the row matters because the cars are on the row we are on. But since the cars on each row are the same, then the condition for row5 at T is the same as row6 at T, etc.\n\nTherefore, we can compute the dangerous turns for any row in {5,6,7,8} as the union of the dangerous turns for each car on that row.\n\nSo let's compute for each car on freeway5 (which is the same for 5,6,7,8) the times T when 0 falls in the car's interval.\n\nCar1: [37 + 6*(T-24), 48 + 6*(T-24)] contains 0?\n  37 + 6*(T-24) <= 0 <= 48 + 6*(T-24)\n  => 37 + 6*(T-24) <= 0 and 0 <= 48 + 6*(T-24)\n  => 6*(T-24) <= -37  => T-24 <= -37/6 ≈ -6.16 -> impossible since T>=24.\n  So car1 never covers 0.\n\nCar2: [-41 + 6*(T-24), -30 + 6*(T-24)] contains 0?\n  -41 + 6*(T-24) <= 0 <= -30 + 6*(T-24)\n  => \n    -41 + 6*(T-24) <= 0  => 6*(T-24) <= 41 => T-24 <= 41/6 ≈ 6.83 => T<=24+6.83 -> T<=30.83 -> T<=30\n    and\n    0 <= -30 + 6*(T-24) => 30 <= 6*(T-24) => 5 <= T-24 => T>=29\n  So for T in [29,30] (integer T: 29 and 30) we have 0 in this interval.\n\nCar3: [-5 + 6*(T-24), 6 + 6*(T-24)] contains 0?\n  -5 + 6*(T-24) <= 0 <= 6 + 6*(T-24)\n  => \n    -5 + 6*(T-24) <= 0 => 6*(T-24) <=5 => T-24 <= 5/6 ≈0.83 => T<=24.83 -> T<=24 (since T is integer and T>=24, so only T=24)\n    and\n    0 <= 6 + 6*(T-24) -> always true for T>=24.\n  So at T=24, we have:\n    -5 + 0 = -5 <=0<=6 -> yes, 0 is in [-5,6] at T=24.\n\nBut wait, at T=24, the interval for car3 is [-5,6] (since T-24=0). So 0 is in [-5,6]. Therefore, at turn24, if we are on freeway5, we would be in danger.\n\nBut note: we start at turn24 at freeway4 (y=4). We are not on freeway5 at turn24. So we are safe at turn24.\n\nHowever, if we choose to move up at turn24, then at turn25 we would be at freeway5 (y=5). So we must check freeway5 at turn25.\n\nAt turn25 (T=25): \n  car1: [37+6=43, 48+6=54] -> no 0\n  car2: [-41+6=-35, -30+6=-24] -> 0 not in [-35,-24]\n  car3: [-5+6=1, 6+6=12] -> 0 not in [1,12]? (0<1) -> no.\n\nSo at turn25, freeway5 is safe.\n\nNow, what about turn26? \n  car2: [-41+12=-29, -30+12=-18] -> 0 not in [-29,-18]? \n  car3: [1+6=7,12+6=18] -> no.\n\nBut we also have to check for T=29 and T=30 for car2? Yes, because car2 covers 0 at T=29 and T=30.\n\nAt T=29: \n  car2: [-41 + 6*(29-24) = -41+30 = -11, -30+30=0] -> interval [-11,0]. 0 is included? Yes, because the interval is closed. So 0 is in [-11,0]? Actually, the interval is [left, right] and since it's moving right, the car at T=29: left = -41 + 6*5 = -41+30=-11, right=-30+30=0. So the car covers from -11 to 0. Therefore, 0 is covered.\n\nAt T=30:\n  car2: [-41+6*6 = -41+36=-5, -30+36=6] -> interval [-5,6] -> 0 is in [-5,6].\n\nSo at T=29 and T=30, if we are on any of the freeways 5,6,7,8, we will collide.\n\nTherefore, we must avoid being on freeways 5,6,7,8 at turns 29 and 30.\n\nNow, what about other dangerous turns? We saw car3 is dangerous only at T=24 for freeway5, but we are not on freeway5 at T=24.\n\nAlso, car1 is never dangerous.\n\nSo the only dangerous turns for freeways 5,6,7,8 are T=29 and T=30.\n\nBut note: freeways 1,2,3,4 are also there. We start at freeway4 (y=4) at T=24. We must avoid being on freeways 1,2,3,4 at dangerous turns as well.\n\nLet me check freeway4 (and similarly 1,2,3) at future turns.\n\nFreeway4 (at t0=24) has two cars:\n  car1: [37,48] (right-moving) -> [37+6*(T-24), 48+6*(T-24)] -> never covers 0 (as with car1 above).\n  car2: [-29,-18] -> at T: [-29+6*(T-24), -18+6*(T-24)]\n\nCheck when 0 is in car2 on freeway4:\n  -29 + 6*(T-24) <= 0 <= -18 + 6*(T-24)\n  => \n    -29 + 6*(T-24) <=0 => 6*(T-24)<=29 => T-24<=29/6≈4.83 -> T<=28.83 -> T<=28\n    and\n    0 <= -18 + 6*(T-24) => 18 <=6*(T-24) => 3<=T-24 => T>=27\n  So T in [27,28] (integers 27 and 28).\n\nAt T=27: \n  car2: [-29+6*3 = -29+18=-11, -18+18=0] -> [-11,0] -> 0 is included? Yes.\nAt T=28: \n  car2: [-29+24=-5, -18+24=6] -> [-5,6] -> 0 is included.\n\nSo at turns 27 and 28, freeway4 is dangerous.\n\nSimilarly, freeway1,2,3 have the same cars as freeway4: two cars: [37,48] and [-29,-18]. So they are dangerous at turns 27 and 28.\n\nTherefore, we have:\n\nDangerous turns per freeway row:\n- Rows 1,2,3,4: dangerous at T=27 and T=28.\n- Rows 5,6,7,8: dangerous at T=29 and T=30.\n\nWe start at T=24 at y=4 (freeway4). We want to get to y=9.\n\nThe minimal moves: we need to go from 4 to 9, which is 5 steps up. So we could do: U,U,U,U,U in 5 moves, which would take 5 turns: \n  T=24: start at 4, then \n  T=24: action U -> at T=25: y=5\n  T=25: action U -> at T=26: y=6\n  T=26: action U -> at T=27: y=7\n  T=27: action U -> at T=28: y=8\n  T=28: action U -> at T=29: y=9\n\nBut note: at T=27, we are at y=7 -> freeway7 -> which is in {5,6,7,8} -> and T=27 is not dangerous for rows 5-8? The dangerous turns for rows 5-8 are 29 and 30. So at T=27, row7 is safe? Yes.\n\nAt T=28, we are at y=8 -> freeway8 -> and T=28 is not dangerous for row8? Dangerous for row8 is 29 and 30. So T=28 is safe.\n\nThen at T=29, we are at y=9 -> which is not a freeway, so no collision.\n\nBut wait, what about T=27 and T=28: we are on rows 7 and 8, which are safe at those turns.\n\nSo the sequence: \n  Turn24: U -> to 5 at T25\n  Turn25: U -> to 6 at T26\n  Turn26: U -> to 7 at T27\n  Turn27: U -> to 8 at T28\n  Turn28: U -> to 9 at T29\n\nBut we must check at each step whether we are safe.\n\nAt T=24: we are at y=4 -> freeway4. We know that at T=24, freeway4 is safe? \n  We computed that freeway4 is dangerous at T=27 and 28, but at T=24: \n    car1: [37,48] -> 0 not in there.\n    car2: [-29,-18] -> 0 not in there? because -29<=0<=-18? No, 0 is greater than -18? Actually, the interval is [-29,-18] which is from -29 to -18, so 0 is not in between. So safe.\n\nAt T=25: we are at y=5 -> freeway5. We computed that at T=25: \n  car1: [43,54] -> safe\n  car2: [-35,-24] -> safe\n  car3: [1,12] -> safe.\n\nAt T=26: y=6 -> freeway6: same as freeway5 at T=26? \n  car1: [37+12=49,48+12=60] -> safe\n  car2: [-41+12=-29, -30+12=-18] -> safe (0 not in [-29,-18])\n  car3: [-5+12=7,6+12=18] -> safe.\n\nAt T=27: y=7 -> freeway7: same as freeway5 at T=27? \n  car1: [37+18=55,48+18=66] -> safe\n  car2: [-41+18=-23, -30+18=-12] -> safe\n  car3: [-5+18=13,6+18=24] -> safe.\n\nAt T=28: y=8 -> freeway8: same as freeway5 at T=28? \n  car1: [37+24=61,48+24=72] -> safe\n  car2: [-41+24=-17, -30+24=-6] -> safe (0 not in [-17,-6])\n  car3: [-5+24=19,6+24=30] -> safe.\n\nThen at T=29: we are at y=9 -> no freeway, safe.\n\nSo this sequence of 5 moves (all U) seems safe.\n\nBut wait, we are at T=24: we are at y=4. The action at turn24 is U, which moves us to y=5 at T=25. So the first action is U at turn24.\n\nThe sequence would be:\n  Turn24: U\n  Turn25: U\n  Turn26: U\n  Turn27: U\n  Turn28: U\n\nAnd we reach y=9 at turn29? Actually, the position at the end of turn28 is y=8. Then at turn28 we apply U, so at turn29 we are at y=9.\n\nBut the problem says: we start at turn t1=24 at (0,4). We take actions at turns 24,25,..., and we want to be at (0,9) at the last action.\n\nThe last action we take is at turn t1+H-1, and after that we are at (0,9). So the total number of actions is H.\n\nIn this case, we take 5 actions: at turns 24,25,26,27,28. Then at the end of turn28 (which is the start of turn29) we are at y=9.\n\nSo H=5.\n\nBut is there a problem? We must avoid being on freeway4 at T=27 and T=28? We are not: we leave freeway4 at the first move (U at turn24) and then we are at freeway5 at T=25, and so on.\n\nAnd we are never on a freeway at a dangerous turn for that freeway.\n\nBut wait: what about freeway4 at T=24? We are there and safe.\n\nSo it seems we have a solution in 5 moves.\n\nBut let me double-check the dangerous turns for freeway4: we said dangerous at T=27 and 28. We are at freeway4 only at T=24, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly, for freeways 5-8, dangerous at T=29 and 30, but we are on freeways 5-8 at T=25 to T=28, which are not 29 or 30.\n\nSo it seems safe.\n\nBut why then is the problem asking for minimal H? 5 is minimal since we need to go up 5 steps.\n\nBut let me check if we can do it in fewer? We cannot because we start at 4 and need to get to 9: 5 steps are required.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 5.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\". We have H=5.\n\nSequence:\nTurn24: U\nTurn25: U\nTurn26: U\nTurn27: U\nTurn28: U\n\nBut wait, at turn28 we are at y=8 and we move to y=9 at the end of turn28 (so at turn29 we are at 9). And we are not at freeway8 at turn29? We are at freeway8 at turn28 (when we are at y=8) and then we move to y=9 at turn28 (by U), so at turn29 we are at y=9. And turn28: we are at y=8 at the beginning of the turn? Actually, the player update: at turn t, we are at y_t, then we choose a_t, and then y_{t+1} = y_t + delta.\n\nSo during turn t, we are at y_t. Therefore, at turn28, we are at y=8 (freeway8) for the entire turn. Then at the end of the turn, we update to y=9 for the next turn (turn29).\n\nAnd we have already checked that at turn28, freeway8 is safe.\n\nSo the sequence is safe.\n\nBut wait, what about the cars on freeway8 at turn28? We computed: \n  car1: [61,72] -> safe\n  car2: [-17,-6] -> safe\n  car3: [19,30] -> safe.\n\nYes.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 5 turns.\n\nBut the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and we have H=5.\n\nBut let me see if we can do it in less? We start at 4 and need to get to 9: we must have at least 5 moves up. So no.\n\nBut what about if we move faster? We can only move one step per turn. So 5 is minimal.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is:\n\nTurn24: U\nTurn25: U\nTurn26: U\nTurn27: U\nTurn28: U\n\nBut the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\". So t from 0 to H-1. Here t1=24, so:\n\na_{24+0} = a24 = U\na_{24+1} = a25 = U\na_{24+2} = a26 = U\na_{24+3} = a27 = U\na_{24+4} = a28 = U\n\nSo H=5.\n\nBut wait, the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\". So after H actions, we have taken actions at turns: t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1. And we are at (0,9) at the end of turn t1+H-1.\n\nIn our case, after 5 actions (at turns 24,25,26,27,28), at the end of turn28 we are at (0,9). So the last turn we act is turn28, and then we are done.\n\nSo the sequence is as above.\n\nBut why then is the example state given? Maybe there is a catch? Or maybe I missed a car.\n\nLet me recheck freeway5 at turn24: we saw car3 at freeway5 at turn24 covers 0? But we are not on freeway5 at turn24. But if we stay at turn24, we remain at freeway4. But if we move up, we leave freeway4 and go to freeway5 at turn25.\n\nBut what if we stay at freeway4? Then at turn25, we are still at freeway4. And we must avoid the dangerous turns for freeway4: T=27 and 28. But at turn25: T=25, freeway4: \n  car1: [37+6=43,48+6=54] -> safe\n  car2: [-29+6=-23, -18+6=-12] -> safe.\n\nSo if we stay at turn24, we are safe at turn24 and turn25 at freeway4. But then we have to eventually move up. But we might get stuck because we have to avoid freeway4 at T=27 and 28.\n\nBut if we move up at turn24, we avoid that.\n\nAlternatively, if we move down? That would be worse.\n\nSo the direct path is safe.\n\nBut wait, what about freeway5 at turn29? We are not on freeway5 at turn29 because we are at y=9 at turn29. So we don't care.\n\nSo I think the sequence is safe.\n\nBut let me check the state at each turn:\n\nTurn24 (current): y=4 -> safe (as above)\nAction: U -> so at the end of turn24, we set y25=5.\n\nTurn25: we are at y=5. \n  Freeway5 at T=25: \n    car1: [37+6=43,48+6=54] -> safe\n    car2: [-41+6=-35,-30+6=-24] -> safe\n    car3: [-5+6=1,6+6=12] -> safe.\nAction: U -> y26=6.\n\nTurn26: y=6 -> freeway6, same as freeway5 at T=26? \n  car1: [37+12=49,54] -> wait, 48+12=60 -> [49,60] -> safe\n  car2: [-41+12=-29, -30+12=-18] -> safe (0 not in [-29,-18])\n  car3: [1+6=7,12+6=18] -> safe.\nAction: U -> y27=7.\n\nTurn27: y=7 -> freeway7, T=27:\n  car1: [37+18=55,48+18=66] -> safe\n  car2: [-41+18=-23, -30+18=-12] -> safe\n  car3: [7+6=13? Actually, at T=27: for car3: [-5+6*(27-24)= -5+18=13, 6+18=24] -> [13,24] -> safe.\nAction: U -> y28=8.\n\nTurn28: y=8 -> freeway8, T=28:\n  car1: [37+24=61,48+24=72] -> safe\n  car2: [-41+24=-17, -30+24=-6] -> safe (0 not in [-17,-6])\n  car3: [-5+24=19,6+24=30] -> safe.\nAction: U -> y29=9.\n\nThen we are done.\n\nSo the sequence is safe.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 24: U\nTurn 25: U\nTurn 26: U\nTurn 27: U\nTurn 28: U\n}\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" and so on. So we write:\n\nTurn 24: U\nTurn 25: U\nTurn 26: U\nTurn 27: U\nTurn 28: U\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\", so we start with turn24.\n\nBut in the box, we write exactly as:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 24: U\nTurn 25: U\nTurn 26: U\nTurn 27: U\nTurn 28: U\n}\n\nBut the problem uses \"t_1\" in the example, but here t1=24.\n\nSo this should be the answer.\n</think>\nThe goal is to reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 4) at turn 24 in the minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y = 1 to 8.\n\n### Analysis:\n- The player starts at y = 4 (freeway 4) at turn 24.\n- The minimal number of moves to reach y = 9 is 5 upward moves (U), as each move increases y by 1.\n- The dangerous turns for freeways 1–4 are turns 27 and 28, as cars on these freeways cover x = 0 at these times.\n- The dangerous turns for freeways 5–8 are turns 29 and 30, as cars on these freeways cover x = 0 at these times.\n- The sequence of actions must avoid being on a freeway during its dangerous turns.\n\n### Safe Path:\n- At turn 24, starting at y = 4 (safe at turn 24), move up to y = 5 at turn 25.\n- At turn 25, at y = 5 (freeway 5), which is safe at turn 25, move up to y = 6 at turn 26.\n- At turn 26, at y = 6 (freeway 6), which is safe at turn 26, move up to y = 7 at turn 27.\n- At turn 27, at y = 7 (freeway 7), which is safe at turn 27 (not dangerous for freeways 5–8), move up to y = 8 at turn 28.\n- At turn 28, at y = 8 (freeway 8), which is safe at turn 28 (not dangerous for freeways 5–8), move up to y = 9 at turn 29.\n\nThis path avoids all dangerous turns:\n- Freeways 1–4 are only occupied at turn 24 (y = 4), which is safe.\n- Freeways 5–8 are occupied at turns 25–28, which are not their dangerous turns (29 and 30).\n- At turn 29, the player is at y = 9, which has no freeway and is safe.\n\nThe sequence requires 5 turns (H = 5) and reaches (0, 9) at the end of turn 28 (after the fifth action).\n\n### Action Sequence:\n- Turn 24: U (move to y = 5 at turn 25)\n- Turn 25: U (move to y = 6 at turn 26)\n- Turn 26: U (move to y = 7 at turn 27)\n- Turn 27: U (move to y = 8 at turn 28)\n- Turn 28: U (move to y = 9 at turn 29)\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 24: U \\\\\nTurn 25: U \\\\\nTurn 26: U \\\\\nTurn 27: U \\\\\nTurn 28: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are given the current turn t1 = 25 and the player is at (0,5). The goal is to reach (0,9) in minimal turns, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nImportant: \n- The player moves at each turn: U (up: y+1), D (down: y-1), or S (stay: y same). But note that y must be in [0,9].\n- Collision occurs at turn T if the player is on a freeway i (meaning y_T = i, and i from 1 to 8) and at that turn, there is a car on freeway i such that the car's span at turn T contains 0 (the x-coordinate where the player is).\n\nNote: When moving from y_T to y_{T+1} at turn T, the player is considered to be on freeway y_T at turn T (so checks collision for freeway y_T at turn T) and then moves to y_{T+1} for the next turn.\n\nGiven car states for each freeway (1 to 8). All cars are moving right (so the span at time T is [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)] for the initial state at t1).\n\nBut note: the car update rules:\n- For a car initially (at t1) with head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s:\n  - If left-moving: span at T is [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)] (and note that if the car is left-moving, then initially h < τ? Actually, the representation might be consistent: for left-moving, the head is the leading part? But in the problem, for left-moving: span(t1)=[h, τ] -> then at T: [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]. But note: if the car is moving left, then the head is the leftmost? Actually, the problem states:\n  - Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] -> then at T: [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]\n  - Right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] -> then at T: [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut in the given data, all cars are right-moving? Because the direction is \"right\". So for each car, we have:\n  initial span at t1: [τ, h] (so τ is the tail and h is the head, and since it's moving right, the head is the rightmost? Actually, in the data: \n  For example, on freeway 1: (54,43,right,6) -> so head=54, tail=43? But then the span at t1 is [43,54]? \n\nBut the problem says for right-moving: Span(t1)=[τ, h]. So in the data, the first two numbers are head and tail? But the problem says for right-moving: [τ, h]. So if the car is right-moving, then the tail is the left end and head is the right end? \n\nLooking at the problem: \n  Right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h] -> Span(T) = [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\"\n\nSo in the data, the first number is the head? But the problem uses (head, tail) in the table. So for right-moving, the head is the right end and tail is the left end? Then the span at t1 is [tail, head]. \n\nIn the data: for freeway 1: (54,43,right,6) -> so head=54, tail=43 -> then the initial span is [43,54]. \n\nSimilarly, the other car: (-12,-23,right,6) -> head=-12, tail=-23? Then initial span is [-23, -12]. \n\nSo for a car at time T (relative to t1: let dt = T - t1), the car's span for a right-moving car is:\n  [τ + s*dt, h + s*dt]\n\nWe need to check at turn T if the player is on freeway k (y_T = k) and if 0 is in the span of any car on freeway k at time T.\n\nNote: the player starts at turn t1 (T0 = t1) at (0,5). We are to plan from turn t1 to turn t1+H-1, and at turn t1+H-1 the player must be at (0,9).\n\nThe actions are taken at each turn starting at t1: a_{t1}, a_{t1+1}, ... until we reach 9.\n\nSince we want minimal H, we should aim to go up as much as possible. However, we must avoid collisions on freeways 6,7,8? Because we are starting at 5 and going to 9.\n\nBut note: we can also go down? But that would take more steps. So we should try to go up every step? But we have to avoid the cars.\n\nLet me list the freeways we must cross: from 5 to 6, then to 7, then to 8, then to 9. And note that we start at 5 and we are at 5 at turn t1. We are not on freeway 5? Actually, freeway 5 is at y=5? But the problem says freeways are at y=1,...,8. So when we are at y=5, we are on freeway 5? Yes.\n\nSo we must avoid collisions at freeway 5 at turn t1 (if any car on freeway5 at t1 has 0 in its span) and then at each subsequent turn when we are on a freeway.\n\nImportant: when we are at turn T and we are at y_T = k (k from 1 to 8) we must check the cars on freeway k at time T.\n\nBut note: if we move from k to k+1 at turn T, then at turn T we are still on k? Yes. Then at turn T+1 we are on k+1.\n\nSo the plan:\n\nWe are at turn T0=25, y=5.\n\nWe want to get to y=9. The minimal number of turns is 4 (if we can go up 4 times: U,U,U,U). But we have to check at each step which freeway we are on and if at that turn there is a car that causes a collision.\n\nSo we need to check for each freeway we step on (if we go up: then we will be on freeway 5 at turn25, freeway6 at turn26, freeway7 at turn27, freeway8 at turn28, and then at turn29 we would be at y=9, which is not a freeway? So we don't check at y=9. But note: the problem says we must reach (0,9). And at the turn when we are at 9, we are done. So we don't need to be at 9 for two turns? We just need to have y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nBut note: the sequence of actions: we take H actions? Actually, the sequence is from t=0 to H-1? The player update: at turn t, we take action a_t, then we get y_{t+1}. But note the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" such that at the end of these actions, at turn t1+H-1, we are at 9.\n\nBut note: at turn t1, we take action a_{t1} and then at turn t1+1, we have y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + Δy_{t1}. So after H actions, we have taken H steps? Then the state at turn t1+H is y_{t1+H} = ... but we require that at turn t1+H-1, we are at 9? \n\nWait, the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and then the player position at turn t1+H-1 is 9.\n\nBut note: the actions are taken at turns: t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1. So the last action is taken at turn t1+H-1. Then the state after that action is at turn t1+H? But we require that at turn t1+H-1 (before the last action) we are at 9? That doesn't seem right.\n\nLet me read: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\".\n\nAnd note: the player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t. So after taking action a_t at turn t, we get y_{t+1}.\n\nTherefore, at turn t1, we start at (0,5). Then we take an action a_{t1} at turn t1, and then at turn t1+1, we are at y_{t1+1}. \n\nSo to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1, that means we take H-1 actions? Because:\n  turn t1: state y_{t1} = 5\n  after a_{t1}: at turn t1+1: y_{t1+1} = 5 + Δy_{t1}\n  ...\n  after the last action (which is at turn t1+H-2?) we are at turn t1+H-1? \n\nBut the sequence is defined for t=0 to H-1: that is, actions at t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1. Then the state at turn t1+H (after the last action) is y_{t1+H}. \n\nBut the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\". \n\nThis is confusing. Let me check the problem statement:\n\n\"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\"\n\nBut by the update, the position at turn t1+H-1 is determined by the actions taken at turns t1 to t1+H-2? \n\nAlternatively, note that the action taken at turn t determines the position at turn t+1. Therefore, the position at turn t1+H-1 is determined by the actions taken at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-2? \n\nBut the sequence includes H actions: from t1 to t1+H-1. And we require that at turn t1+H-1 the player is at (0,9). \n\nBut the action at turn t1+H-1 would then determine the position at turn t1+H, which we don't care about? But the requirement is at turn t1+H-1.\n\nSo if we are already at 9 at turn t1+H-1, then the action at turn t1+H-1 is not necessary? But the sequence is defined for H actions. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sequence of H actions leads to the state at turn t1+H being 9? But the problem says \"at turn t1+H-1\".\n\nLet me reread: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} which minimizes H such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\"\n\nBut note: the actions are taken at time t1+t for t=0 to H-1. Then the state at time t1+H (after the last action) would be the result of the last action? \n\nBut the problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\"\n\nSo we require that at the moment we take the last action (at turn t1+H-1), we are already at 9? That doesn't make sense because the action at t1+H-1 would change the state.\n\nI think there is an inconsistency. Let me look at the update: \n  y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\n\nSo at turn t, we are at y_t. Then we choose a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nTherefore, at the start of turn t1, we are at y_{t1}=5. Then we choose a_{t1}, which moves us to y_{t1+1}. \n\nWe want y_{t1+H-1}=9. This is the state at the start of turn t1+H-1? Or at the end? \n\nIn the problem, the position is given for turn t1: (0,y_{t1}). So y_{t1} is the state at turn t1. Then after taking action a_{t1}, we get y_{t1+1}.\n\nTherefore, y_{t1+H-1} is the state at the beginning of turn t1+H-1. Then we take action a_{t1+H-1} and then we get y_{t1+H}. But we don't care about that.\n\nWe require that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at 9. Then we take an action at that turn? But we are already at 9. The action could be S, U, D? But if we are at 9 and we take U, we try to go to 10, but y must be in [0,9]. The problem says: \"y_{t+1} ∈ [0,9]\". So if we are at 9 and take U, we remain at 9? Or the move is not allowed? The problem doesn't specify, but note: \"y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\" and then clipped to [0,9]? \n\nThe problem says: \"y_{t+1} ∈ [0,9]\". So if we are at 9 and take U, then y_{t+1} = min(9, 10) = 9? Similarly, if we take D, we go to 8.\n\nBut we require that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at 9. Then we take an action, but we don't care as long as we have reached 9 at that turn.\n\nBut note: the sequence of actions includes H actions, the last one at turn t1+H-1. And we require that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at 9. How did we get to 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1? By the actions taken at turns t1 to t1+H-2. \n\nTherefore, the action at turn t1+H-1 is taken after we have already reached 9. So we can choose any action? But we don't care about the state after that. However, we must avoid collision on the freeway at turn t1+H-1? \n\nBut at turn t1+H-1, we are at y=9, which is not a freeway (freeways are 1-8). So no collision check at y=9.\n\nSo the minimal H: we start at turn t1=25, at y=5. We want to be at y=9 at turn t1+H-1. The minimal H is the minimal number of actions we take such that after H-1 moves we are at 9. \n\nHow many moves? To go from 5 to 9: we need 4 moves upward. So if we do U,U,U,U, then:\n  Turn t1 (25): start at 5, take U -> turn26: y=6\n  Turn26: take U -> turn27: y=7\n  Turn27: take U -> turn28: y=8\n  Turn28: take U -> turn29: y=9\n\nBut we require that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1=25+H-1, we are at 9. In this case, at the beginning of turn29, we are at 9? But in the above, at the beginning of turn25: y=5; turn26: y=6; ... turn29: y=9. So we are at y=9 at the beginning of turn29. \n\nTherefore, we need to set H such that t1+H-1 = 29? \n  25 + H - 1 = 29 -> H = 29-24 = 5.\n\nBut we took 4 actions: at turn25,26,27,28. So the sequence has H=5 actions? That would be actions at turn25,26,27,28,29. But we don't need the last action? \n\nAlternatively, we set H=4? Then the sequence is actions at turn25,26,27,28. Then the state at the beginning of turn25+4-1=28 is y28? But in the above, at the beginning of turn28 we are at y=8, not 9.\n\nSo to be at 9 at the beginning of turn T, we must have taken the last upward move at turn T-1. \n\nTherefore, to be at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we must have taken the last upward move at turn t1+H-2. And we started at 5. So we need 4 upward moves. Therefore, the minimal H must be at least 5: \n  Actions at turn25,26,27,28,29? But at turn29 we are at 9? No, the state at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 = 25+H-1 must be 9. \n\nIf we take 4 actions (H=4) at turns25,26,27,28, then the state at the beginning of turn25+4-1=28 is the state after the third action? \n\nLet me write the timeline:\n\nTurn25 (begin): y25=5\n  a25: U -> y26=6\nTurn26 (begin): y26=6\n  a26: U -> y27=7\nTurn27 (begin): y27=7\n  a27: U -> y28=8\nTurn28 (begin): y28=8\n  a28: U -> y29=9\n\nWe require y_{t1+H-1} = y_{25+H-1} = 9.\n\nSo 25+H-1 = 29? -> H=5. Then the sequence of actions is for t=0 to 4 (5 actions): \n  t0: a25\n  t1: a26\n  t2: a27\n  t3: a28\n  t4: a29\n\nBut at turn29 (begin) we are at y29=9, which satisfies the condition. Then we take a29? But we are already at 9. So we can set a29 to S? \n\nBut note: we are at freeway? At turn29, we are at y=9, which is not a freeway, so no collision. So we can set a29 to S (or U or D, but we are at 9, so if we set U we stay at 9, D goes to 8, but we don't care as long as at the beginning of turn29 we are at 9).\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 5? But we could be at 9 earlier? \n\nAlternatively, we can be at 9 at the beginning of turn28? How? \n  We start at 5 at turn25. \n  We need to get to 9 in two moves? Not possible: maximum 2 moves: 5 -> 7. \n  Three moves: 5->8. \n  Four moves: 5->9? But we can only move one per step? So 5->6->7->8->9: that's 4 moves, so at the beginning of turn29 we are at 9. \n\nTherefore, minimal H is 5.\n\nBut we have to avoid collisions. We must check for each freeway we are on at the time we are on it.\n\nIn the plan above, we are on:\n  turn25: freeway5? (y=5) -> at turn25, we are at freeway5.\n  turn26: freeway6\n  turn27: freeway7\n  turn28: freeway8\n\nAnd at turn29: y=9, not a freeway.\n\nSo we must check freeway5 at turn25, freeway6 at turn26, freeway7 at turn27, freeway8 at turn28.\n\nWe are given the car states at turn25 (t1=25). \n\nFor each freeway, we have a list of cars. For a car, we can compute its span at turn T (relative to t1: dt = T-25).\n\nFor a right-moving car: initial span [τ, h] at turn25, then at turn T: [τ + s*dt, h + s*dt]\n\nWe need to check if 0 is in that interval at turn T.\n\nLet's check for each freeway and each car at the required turn.\n\nFirst, freeway5 at turn25 (dt=0):\n  Cars: \n    (54,43,right,6): span at turn25: [43,54] -> 0 is not in [43,54]\n    (-24,-35,right,6): span at turn25: [-35,-24] -> 0 not in [-35,-24]\n    (12,1,right,6): span at turn25: [1,12] -> 0 not in [1,12]? 0 is less than 1 -> no.\n\nSo freeway5 at turn25: safe.\n\nFreeway6 at turn26 (dt=1):\n  Cars: \n    (54,43,right,6): [43+6*1, 54+6*1] = [49,60] -> 0 not in [49,60]\n    (-24,-35,right,6): [-35+6, -24+6] = [-29,-18] -> 0 not in [-29,-18]\n    (12,1,right,6): [1+6,12+6] = [7,18] -> 0 not in [7,18]\n\nSafe.\n\nFreeway7 at turn27 (dt=2):\n  Cars:\n    (54,43,right,6): [43+12,54+12] = [55,66] -> no\n    (-24,-35,right,6): [-35+12, -24+12] = [-23,-12] -> no\n    (12,1,right,6): [1+12,12+12] = [13,24] -> no\n\nSafe.\n\nFreeway8 at turn28 (dt=3):\n  Cars:\n    (54,43,right,6): [43+18,54+18] = [61,72] -> no\n    (-24,-35,right,6): [-35+18, -24+18] = [-17,-6] -> no\n    (12,1,right,6): [1+18,12+18] = [19,30] -> no\n\nSafe.\n\nTherefore, the plan: \n  Turn25: U -> to 6\n  Turn26: U -> to 7\n  Turn27: U -> to 8\n  Turn28: U -> to 9\n  Turn29: ? We must provide an action for turn29? But we are already at 9 at the beginning of turn29? And we require that at turn29 (which is t1+H-1=25+5-1=29) we are at 9. Then we take an action? We can choose any, but to be safe, we can choose S (stay). \n\nBut note: at turn29, we are at y=9 (not a freeway) so no collision. So we can set a29 to S.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 5, and the actions are:\n\nTurn25: U\nTurn26: U\nTurn27: U\nTurn28: U\nTurn29: S\n\nBut wait, the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" for t from 0 to H-1, which are 5 actions: t0 (t1+0=25) to t4 (t1+4=29).\n\nBut note: the requirement is that at turn t1+H-1=29, we are at 9. And at the beginning of turn29, we are at 9. Then we take the action at turn29 (which is S) and then we are still at 9? But we don't care about after.\n\nHowever, the problem says \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\", meaning at the beginning of that turn? Or after the action? \n\nThe problem says: \"the player position at turn t1 is (0, y_{t1})\". So the position is given at the beginning of the turn. Then we take an action and move to the next state. Therefore, the position at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 is y_{t1+H-1}. \n\nIn our plan, at the beginning of turn29, we are at 9. So we have reached. Then we take an action at turn29, but that action doesn't affect the condition.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nTurn25: U\nTurn26: U\nTurn27: U\nTurn28: U\nTurn29: S\n\nBut note: we could also set Turn29: U? But that would keep us at 9. Or D? Then we go to 8. But then at the beginning of turn30 we are at 8? But we don't care about turn30. However, the condition is only that at turn29 we are at 9 (at the beginning). So we can set any action at turn29. But to be minimal, we don't want to do anything that might cause an issue? But since we are at 9, no freeway, no collision. So we can set S or U.\n\nBut the problem says: we must avoid collisions at the turns we are on freeways. At turn29 we are at 9, so no freeway. So safe.\n\nBut note: the action at turn29 is taken at turn29, and at that turn we are at y=9. The collision check is only when we are on freeways (y=1..8). So no check.\n\nTherefore, the above plan is safe.\n\nBut wait: the car states for freeways 1 to 4? We are never on them? We start at 5 and go up to 9. So we skip freeways 1 to 4. So we don't need to check them.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 5.\n\nBut let me double-check the car states for freeway5 to 8. We did, and they are safe.\n\nBut note: the car list for freeways 1-4 and 5-8 are different? \n\nLooking at the given:\n\nFreeway1: two cars: (54,43,right,6) and (-12,-23,right,6)\nFreeway2: same as freeway1? \nFreeway3: same\nFreeway4: same\nFreeway5: three cars: (54,43,right,6), (-24,-35,right,6), (12,1,right,6)\nFreeway6: same as freeway5\nFreeway7: same\nFreeway8: same\n\nSo for freeway5 at turn25 (dt=0): \n  (54,43,right,6): [43,54] -> 0 not in [43,54]\n  (-24,-35,right,6): [-35,-24] -> 0 not in\n  (12,1,right,6): [1,12] -> 0 not in? 0 is less than 1.\n\nBut note: [1,12] is inclusive? The problem says \"span\", and 0 is not in [1,12]. \n\nSimilarly for the others.\n\nBut wait: the car on freeway5: (12,1,right,6) at turn25: [1,12]. At turn25, the player is at x=0, which is not in [1,12]. Safe.\n\nBut what about at later turns? We are only at freeway5 at turn25. So we don't care about freeway5 at other turns.\n\nSimilarly, we are at freeway6 at turn26: \n  The cars on freeway6: same as freeway5? \n  (54,43,right,6): at turn26 (dt=1): [43+6,54+6]=[49,60] -> 0 not in.\n  (-24,-35,right,6): [-35+6, -24+6] = [-29,-18] -> 0 not in.\n  (12,1,right,6): [1+6,12+6]=[7,18] -> 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo the plan is safe.\n\nBut is there a way to do it in fewer than 5 turns? \n\nWe require to be at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1. The earliest we can be at 9 is at the beginning of turn29 (if we start at turn25). Because we need 4 moves. So minimal H is 5.\n\nAlternatively, if we could be at 9 at the beginning of turn28? Then we would have to move from 5 to 9 in 3 moves: that would require moving up 4 steps in 3 moves? Impossible. So minimal H=5.\n\nBut note: we can also move down? But that would take more moves. So we don't.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 25: U\nTurn 26: U\nTurn 27: U\nTurn 28: U\nTurn 29: S\n}\n\nBut the problem says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" so we write:\n\nTurn 25: U\nTurn 26: U\nTurn 27: U\nTurn 28: U\nTurn 29: S\n\nBut note: the initial state is at turn25. The actions are taken at turn25,26,27,28,29.\n\nWe could also set the last action to U? But that would be the same. Or D? Then at turn30 we would be at 8, but we don't care. But the problem only requires that at turn29 (beginning) we are at 9. So we can choose any. But to be consistent, we choose S.\n\nAlternatively, we can stop at the fourth action? But then H would be 4? Then we would be at 9 at turn29? But with H=4, the last action is at turn28, and the state at turn25+4-1=28 is the state after the third action? \n\nLet me clarify:\n\nIf we set H=4, then the actions are taken at turn25,26,27,28. Then the state at turn25+4-1=28 is the state at the beginning of turn28? \n\nAfter the actions at turn25,26,27,28:\n  After a25 (U): at turn26: y=6\n  After a26 (U): at turn27: y=7\n  After a27 (U): at turn28: y=8\n  After a28 (U): at turn29: y=9\n\nBut we require the state at the beginning of turn28? That is, before taking a28? Then we are at 8, not 9.\n\nSo we need H=5 to have the state at the beginning of turn29 be 9.\n\nTherefore, we must have 5 actions.\n\nBut note: we could be at 9 at the beginning of turn28? That would require that after the actions at turn25,26,27, we are at 9 at the beginning of turn28. But then we would have moved from 5 to 9 in 3 moves: that is 4 steps? Impossible.\n\nSo the minimal H is 5.\n\nOne more thing: what if we take a different route? For example, go down to 4 then up? That would take more moves. So no.\n\nTherefore, the answer is as above.\n\nBut let me check freeway5 at turn25 again? We have a car (12,1,right,6): [1,12] at turn25. The player is at 0. Since 0 is not in [1,12], safe.\n\nBut note: what if the car spans are inclusive? The problem doesn't specify, but we assume inclusive. So [1,12] includes 1,2,...,12. 0 is not included.\n\nSimilarly, for the other cars.\n\nSo we are safe.\n\nTherefore, the minimal sequence is:\n\nTurn 25: U\nTurn 26: U\nTurn 27: U\nTurn 28: U\nTurn 29: S\n\nBut the problem says: \"avoid collisions with cars on freeways y=1,...,8\". We are at freeway5 at turn25, freeway6 at turn26, freeway7 at turn27, freeway8 at turn28. And we checked each. Safe.\n\nWe are never on freeway1,2,3,4. So no need to check.\n\nSo the answer.\n</think>\nThe goal is to reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 5) at turn \\(t_1 = 25\\) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\), avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\nThe minimal path requires moving up four times to go from \\(y = 5\\) to \\(y = 9\\). This takes 4 moves, resulting in being at \\(y = 9\\) at the beginning of turn 29. The number of turns \\(H\\) is the number of actions taken, which must include an action at turn 29 to satisfy the requirement that the position at turn \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 29\\) is (0, 9). Thus, \\(H = 5\\), with actions taken at turns 25 to 29.\n\nThe sequence of actions is:\n- **Turn 25**: Move up (U) to \\(y = 6\\).\n- **Turn 26**: Move up (U) to \\(y = 7\\).\n- **Turn 27**: Move up (U) to \\(y = 8\\).\n- **Turn 28**: Move up (U) to \\(y = 9\\).\n- **Turn 29**: Stay (S) at \\(y = 9\\) (or any action, as \\(y = 9\\) is not a freeway and no collision check occurs).\n\n### Collision Avoidance Verification:\n- **At turn 25 (freeway 5)**: Cars are at spans [43, 54], [-35, -24], and [1, 12]. The player is at \\(x = 0\\), not in any span. Safe.\n- **At turn 26 (freeway 6)**: Cars are at spans [49, 60], [-29, -18], and [7, 18]. \\(x = 0\\) not in any span.

The update for right-moving: \n   Span(T) = [tau + s*(T-26), head + s*(T-26)]\n\nBut note: the given head and tail at turn 26. For right-moving, the head is the front (so the car extends from tail to head, and head>tail). So at turn 26, the car is from tail to head. Then at turn T, it moves right: \n   tail(T) = tail(26) + s*(T-26)\n   head(T) = head(26) + s*(T-26)\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, the head is the front (which is the leftmost? Actually the problem states for left-moving: \n   Initially at t1: span = [h, tau] -> meaning h is the leftmost (head) and tau is the rightmost (tail)? But note the update: \n   [h, tau] becomes [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut in the given data, all cars are right-moving? Because the direction is \"right\". So we don't have left-moving cars in this problem.\n\nLooking at the car state:\n\nAll cars are right-moving. For example, freeway 1: \n   (60,49,right,6) and (-6,-17,right,6)\n\nSo for a right-moving car, the span at turn 26 is [tail, head] = [49,60] for the first car? But wait: the problem says for right-moving: the span at t1 is [tau, head] meaning tau is the tail (left end) and head is the front (right end). So the car covers [tau, head]. \n\nBut note: the problem states for right-moving: \n   Span(t1) = [tau, head] \n   Then at T: [tau + s*(T-t1), head + s*(T-t1)]\n\nSo for the car (60,49,right,6): \n   This must be (head, tail) = (60,49) meaning at t1=26, the car is from 49 to 60? But that doesn't make sense because 49<60, so it's [49,60]. Then the update: at T, it becomes [49 + 6*(T-26), 60 + 6*(T-26)].\n\nSimilarly, the other car on freeway1: (-6,-17,right,6) -> head=-6, tail=-17? Then the car is from -17 to -6? Then at T: [-17+6*(T-26), -6+6*(T-26)].\n\nBut note: the collision condition is that the car must have 0 in its span at the same turn the player is on that freeway.\n\nWe are at turn T (relative to 26: T = 26 + t) and at y-coordinate y_T (which is between 0 and 9). We only check the freeway y_T at turn T.\n\nWe need to avoid being on a freeway row (1-8) when at that turn T, there is a car on that freeway whose span includes 0.\n\nWe start at y=6 at turn 26. We want to get to y=9.\n\nThe minimal H would be at least 3 (if we go up three times: 6->7, 7->8, 8->9). But we must check if we can do that without collision.\n\nWe'll simulate the car positions at the turns we might be on the freeways.\n\nLet t be the number of turns after 26. So at turn 26+t, the player is at y_{26+t}.\n\nWe start at t=0: y=6.\n\nWe are going to consider actions for t=0,1,2,... until we reach y=9.\n\nWe are to find the minimal H and the sequence.\n\nFirst, note that we are at y=6 at turn 26. We don't check collision at y=6 at turn 26? Actually, we must check the current state? The problem says: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if ...\" and we are at turn 26. So we must check if at turn 26, on freeway 6, there is a car that has 0 in its span at turn 26.\n\nBut note: the player is at (0,6) at turn 26. So we are on freeway 6 at turn 26. We must check the cars on freeway 6 at turn 26.\n\nLooking at freeway 6: \n   Cars: (60,49,right,6), (-18,-29,right,6), (18,7,right,6)\n\nAt turn 26, we need to check if 0 is in any of these spans.\n\nFor the first car: [49,60] -> 0 is not in [49,60] -> safe.\nSecond car: [-29,-18] -> 0 is not in [-29,-18] -> safe.\nThird car: [7,18] -> 0 not in [7,18] -> safe.\n\nSo we are safe at turn 26.\n\nNow, we consider the next moves.\n\nWe want to minimize H, so we try to go up as much as possible.\n\nOption 1: Go up at turn 26 (t=0): then at turn 27 we are at y=7.\n\nAt turn 27 (t=1), we are on freeway 7. Check freeway 7 at turn 27 (which is 26+1).\n\nFreeway 7 has the same cars as freeway 6? Actually, the table:\n\nFreeway 7: (60,49,right,6), (-18,-29,right,6), (18,7,right,6)\n\nSo we compute the positions at turn 27 (t=1):\n\nFirst car: [49 + 6*1, 60 + 6*1] = [55,66] -> 0 not in [55,66]\nSecond car: [-29 + 6*1, -18 + 6*1] = [-23,-12] -> 0 not in [-23,-12]\nThird car: [7+6, 18+6] = [13,24] -> 0 not in [13,24]\n\nSo safe at turn 27 at y=7.\n\nThen we go up again at turn 27: so at turn 28 we are at y=8.\n\nCheck freeway 8 at turn 28 (t=2):\n\nFreeway 8: same car types.\n\nFirst car: [49+6*2, 60+6*2] = [61,72] -> safe\nSecond car: [-29+12, -18+12] = [-17,-6] -> 0 is not in [-17,-6] (since -17<=0<=-6? But 0 is greater than -6? Actually, -6 is the upper bound? So 0 is not in [-17,-6] because -17<=x<=-6 and 0>-6 -> safe.\nThird car: [7+12, 18+12] = [19,30] -> safe.\n\nThen at turn 28, we are at y=8. Then we want to go up to y=9 at turn 29.\n\nBut note: when we are at turn 28, we are at y=8. Then we choose action U to go to y=9 at the next turn. At turn 29, we are at y=9. And y=9 is not a freeway (freeways are 1-8), so no collision check at turn 29.\n\nBut we must check at turn 28 (when we were at y=8) and we did that: safe.\n\nAlso, at turn 29, we are at y=9, which is the goal.\n\nSo the sequence would be:\n\nTurn 26: U\nTurn 27: U\nTurn 28: U\n\nThen we are at y=9 at turn 29? Actually, note:\n\nAt turn 26: we start at y=6. We do U -> at turn 27: y=7.\nAt turn 27: U -> at turn 28: y=8.\nAt turn 28: U -> at turn 29: y=9.\n\nBut the problem says: we are to have a sequence of actions from t1 to t1+H-1, and then at the end of these actions we should be at (0,9). So at turn 26+H-1, we are at (0,9).\n\nWe start at turn 26 (t=0) and we take actions at turn 26,27,28 (3 actions). Then at turn 29 (which is 26+3) we are at (0,9). So H=3? But note: the sequence is for t from 0 to H-1? \n\nThe sequence is for t=0 to H-1: so we take H actions starting at t1. Then the player's position after H actions is at turn t1+H. But we require that at turn t1+H-1 we are at (0,9). \n\nWait, the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and then \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\nBut note the update: after taking action a_{t} at turn t, we move to y_{t+1}. So:\n\nAt turn t1: we are at y_{t1}. Then we take action a_{t1} and move to y_{t1+1} at turn t1+1.\n...\nAt turn t1+H-1: we take action a_{t1+H-1} and then we are at y_{t1+H} at turn t1+H.\n\nBut the problem requires that at turn t1+H-1 we are at (0,9). That doesn't seem to match.\n\nLet me re-read: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\" and then it says \"such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\".\n\nBut note: the problem states the player update: \n   y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t\n\nSo at the moment we are at turn t1, we are at y_{t1}. Then we take action a_{t1} and at turn t1+1 we are at y_{t1+1}. \n\nSo to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1, that means we must have taken H-1 actions? \n\nBut the sequence is defined for t=0 to H-1, meaning we take H actions. Then the last action is taken at turn t1+H-1 and then we are at y_{t1+H} at turn t1+H. \n\nBut the problem says: we should be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1. \n\nThis seems inconsistent. \n\nLooking back: \"reach (0,9)\" and then the condition is \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\nBut note: at the start of turn t1, we are at y_{t1}. We haven't taken any action at turn t1 yet. Then we take an action at turn t1, and then we are at y_{t1+1} at the start of turn t1+1. \n\nSo the position at the start of turn t is y_t.\n\nTherefore, we require that at the start of turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9). But that would mean we have taken H-1 actions? \n\nBut the sequence is from t=0 to H-1: so we take H actions. \n\nAlternatively, the problem might mean that we take H actions and then at the turn after the last action we are at the goal? \n\nBut the problem states: \"such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\nThis is confusing. Let me parse the indices.\n\nWe are at turn t1: at the beginning of turn t1, we are at (0, y_{t1}).\n\nThen we choose an action a_{t1}. Then we update to y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + Delta y_{t1}. Then we are at (0, y_{t1+1}) at the beginning of turn t1+1.\n\nWe want to be at (0,9) at the beginning of some turn. The problem says: at turn t1+H-1 we are at (0,9).\n\nSo at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9). How many actions have we taken? From turn t1 to turn t1+H-2: that's (H-1) actions? \n\nBut the sequence is defined for t=0 to H-1, meaning we take actions at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1. That's H actions. Then after taking the action at turn t1+H-1, we are at y_{t1+H} at the beginning of turn t1+H.\n\nSo to have y_{t1+H-1}=9, that would be the position at the beginning of turn t1+H-1. But we haven't taken the action at turn t1+H-1 yet? \n\nThis is messy.\n\nLooking at the answer format: \n   Turn t1: a_{t1}\n   Turn t1+1: a_{t1+1}\n   ...\n   Turn t1+H-1: a_{t1+H-1}\n\nAnd then we stop. So we take H actions: at turns t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nAfter taking the last action at turn t1+H-1, we update to y_{t1+H} at the beginning of turn t1+H. \n\nBut the problem requires: \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\nI think there might be an off-by-one. Let me check the problem statement again: \n   \"such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\"\n\nBut note: the initial state is at turn t1, and we are at y_{t1}. Then we take an action at turn t1 and move to y_{t1+1} at turn t1+1.\n\nWe want to be at y=9 at the beginning of a turn. The minimal H would be the number of actions required so that the beginning of turn t1+H-1 is at y=9? \n\nBut that would mean that we are at y=9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, and then we don't take an action at turn t1+H-1? But the sequence goes up to a_{t1+H-1}.\n\nAlternatively, the requirement might be that after H actions we are at y=9 at the beginning of turn t1+H. Then the condition would be y_{t1+H}=9.\n\nBut the problem explicitly says y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nPerhaps I made a mistake. Let me read carefully: \n   \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nand then \"such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\".\n\nThis implies that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9). How do we achieve that? \n\nWe start at turn t1 at y_{t1}=6. We need to get to 9. The minimal number of moves is 3 (if we go up three times). Then we would have:\n\nBeginning of turn t1: y=6.\nAfter action at turn t1 (U): beginning of turn t1+1: y=7.\nAfter action at turn t1+1 (U): beginning of turn t1+2: y=8.\nAfter action at turn t1+2 (U): beginning of turn t1+3: y=9.\n\nBut we want to be at (0,9) at the beginning of turn t1+H-1. So if we set H-1 = 3, then H=4? Then we would be at y=9 at the beginning of turn t1+3 = t1+H-1 (since H=4 -> H-1=3). \n\nBut then the sequence would be for t=0 to 3 (4 actions): \n   a_{t1}, a_{t1+1}, a_{t1+2}, a_{t1+3}\n\nBut then after the fourth action (at turn t1+3) we would be at y_{t1+4}? That would be beyond 9.\n\nAlternatively, if we only take 3 actions (H=3), then the sequence is t=0,1,2: \n   a_{t1}, a_{t1+1}, a_{t1+2}\n\nand then the state at the beginning of turn t1+3 is y_{t1+3}=9. But the problem requires y_{t1+H-1}=y_{t1+2}=9? That would require we are at 9 at turn t1+2.\n\nBut we start at 6. How to get to 9 in two moves? We can: \n   Move U at turn t1: then at turn t1+1: y=7.\n   Move U at turn t1+1: then at turn t1+2: y=8? Not 9.\n\nWe need three moves to get from 6 to 9. So we cannot be at 9 at turn t1+2.\n\nTherefore, I suspect the problem has a typo. It should be that at the beginning of turn t1+H we are at (0,9). Then H is the number of actions (so H=3) and then at turn t1+3 we are at (0,9).\n\nBut the problem explicitly says: \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\".\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sequence of actions leads to the position at the same turn? \n\nBut the dynamics say: after taking an action at turn t, we update the position for the next turn.\n\nI think the intended meaning is: we take H actions and then at the next turn (turn t1+H) we are at (0,9). Then the condition should be y_{t1+H}=9.\n\nGiven the confusion, let me look at the example in the problem: but there is no example.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and then the sequence is for H actions. And we want to be at (0,9) at the end.\n\nI think the standard interpretation is: we start at turn t1 at (0,6). We take an action at turn t1, then at turn t1+1 we are at a new position. We take an action at turn t1+1, and so on. We want to be at (0,9) at the beginning of a turn. The minimal number of actions is 3, and that would make us at (0,9) at the beginning of turn t1+3.\n\nTherefore, the condition should be y_{t1+3}=9. So H should be 3, and the sequence is for turns t1, t1+1, t1+2.\n\nBut the problem states: \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\". If H=3, then we require y_{t1+2}=9. But we are at y=8 at turn t1+2.\n\nSo that doesn't work.\n\nIf we set H=4, then we require y_{t1+3}=9. Then we take actions at turns t1, t1+1, t1+2, and then at turn t1+3 we are at y=9. But then the sequence would be 4 actions? But we only need 3 moves. The fourth action would be taken at turn t1+3 to move from y=9? But we are already at 9, so we can do S (stay). Then:\n\n   Turn t1: U -> y=7 at turn t1+1\n   Turn t1+1: U -> y=8 at turn t1+2\n   Turn t1+2: U -> y=9 at turn t1+3\n   Turn t1+3: S -> y=9 at turn t1+4\n\nBut then at turn t1+3 we are at y=9? Then we are done? But the problem says we should be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1 = t1+3. And we are at turn t1+3 at y=9? But then we have taken 3 actions? The sequence would be for t=0 to H-1=3, so four actions? \n\nBut we only need three moves to get to 9. The fourth action (at turn t1+3) is unnecessary.\n\nAlternatively, we can do:\n\n   Turn t1: S -> stay at 6 (then at turn t1+1 we are still at 6)\n   Turn t1+1: U -> 7 at turn t1+2\n   Turn t1+2: U -> 8 at turn t1+3\n   Turn t1+3: U -> 9 at turn t1+4\n\nThen at the beginning of turn t1+4 we are at 9. But then we require y_{t1+H-1}=9. If H=4, then we require at turn t1+3 we are at 9? But we are at 8 at turn t1+3.\n\nThis is very confusing.\n\nAnother possibility: the problem might mean that after taking the sequence of actions, at the last action's turn, we are at (0,9). But the last action is taken at turn t1+H-1, and then at that same turn we are at (0,9). But according to the dynamics, the position at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 is y_{t1+H-1}, and then we take an action and move to y_{t1+H} at the next turn.\n\nSo to be at (0,9) at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we don't take any action at that turn? But the sequence requires an action for turn t1+H-1.\n\nUnless we do nothing? But we have to specify an action.\n\nGiven the confusion, I think there might be a mistake in the problem statement. However, looking at the answer format, it says:\n\n   Turn t1: a_{t1}\n   Turn t1+1: a_{t1+1}\n   ...\n\n   Turn t1+H-1: a_{t1+H-1}\n\nAnd then we are done. So the last action is at turn t1+H-1. Then the state after this last action is at turn t1+H. So we are at (0,9) at turn t1+H.\n\nBut the problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\", which is the state at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, before the action at that turn.\n\nThis is inconsistent.\n\nI notice that the problem says: \"the minimal number of turns H\", and then the sequence is for H actions. But in the condition, it says y_{t1+H-1}=9. \n\nPerhaps \"turns H\" here means the number of game turns including the starting turn? But then we start at turn t1 and then we have H turns: turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1. Then the last state we care about is at turn t1+H-1. We want to be at (0,9) at the beginning of turn t1+H-1. \n\nThen we need to take actions at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-2 to affect the state at turn t1+H-1.\n\nBut then the sequence would be for turns t1 to t1+H-2, which is H-1 actions. But the problem says the sequence is from t=0 to H-1, which is H actions.\n\nThis is not matching.\n\nGiven the time, I will assume that the intended meaning is that we want to be at (0,9) at the beginning of turn t1+H, and we have taken H actions (at turns t1 to t1+H-1) to get there. This is the standard way.\n\nThen H=3 and we take actions at turns 26,27,28:\n\n   Turn 26: U -> to y=7 at turn 27\n   Turn 27: U -> to y=8 at turn 28\n   Turn 28: U -> to y=9 at turn 29\n\nAnd we are at (0,9) at turn 29 = t1+3.\n\nBut then the condition should be y_{t1+3}=9, not y_{t1+2}=9.\n\nSince the problem explicitly says y_{t1+H-1}=9, then for H=3, we require y_{26+2}=y_28=9. But we are at y=8 at turn 28.\n\nTherefore, we must be at y=9 at the beginning of turn 28. How can we do that? We must move from 6 to 9 in two moves? That's impossible because we can only move one unit per action.\n\nUnless we are allowed to move faster? The actions U, D, S only change by -1,0,1.\n\nSo it's impossible to be at 9 at turn 28 if we start at 6 at turn 26.\n\nTherefore, the only possibility is that the problem meant that we are at (0,9) at turn t1+H. Then we ignore the written condition and use that.\n\nPerhaps the index of the turn is different. Another interpretation: maybe the \"turn\" in \"minimal number of turns H\" means the number of turns after the current turn? So including the current turn as turn0? But then at turn0 (current) we are at 6, and we want to be at 9 at turn H-1.\n\nBut then we have H turns: turn0 to turnH-1. We want at turnH-1 we are at 9. Then the actions are taken at turn0, turn1, ..., turnH-1? But then we take H actions.\n\nAnd the actions affect the next turn. So:\n\n   At turn0 (t1): we are at y0=6.\n   We take action a0, then at turn1 we are at y1 = y0 + Delta.\n   ...\n   At turnH-1: we take action a_{H-1} and then at turnH we are at y_{H}.\n\nBut we want to be at 9 at the beginning of turnH-1. So y_{H-1}=9.\n\nThen we only take actions from turn0 to turnH-2 (H-1 actions) to influence up to turnH-1. But the problem says the sequence is for t=0 to H-1 (H actions).\n\nSo again, we have an extra action.\n\nGiven the time, and since we already checked that the three moves up are safe, I will output the three moves and assume that the goal is to be at 9 at turn t1+3.\n\nThen the answer would be:\n\nTurn 26: U\nTurn 27: U\nTurn 28: U\n\nBut then at turn 29 we are at 9. But the problem says we must be at 9 at turn t1+H-1 = 26+H-1. If H=3, then turn 26+2=28. But we are at 8 at turn28 and at turn29 we are at9.\n\nSo we are not at 9 at turn28.\n\nTherefore, we must do something else: perhaps we can move faster? We can't.\n\nPerhaps we can use fewer actions by moving up twice and then something else? No, we need three up moves.\n\nUnless there is a way to be at 9 in two moves? No.\n\nPerhaps the starting turn is counted as turn0 and then after three actions we are at turn3 (which is t1+3) and we are at9.\n\nAnd the problem condition is misstated.\n\nGiven that the car positions are safe for the three moves, and we can't avoid the three moves, I will output the three actions and set H=3.\n\nBut the answer format requires the actions for turns 26 to 26+H-1. For H=3, that's turns 26,27,28.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 26: U\nTurn 27: U\nTurn 28: U\n\nBut then at the beginning of turn29, we are at9.\n\nTo satisfy the condition y_{t1+H-1}=y_{28}=9, we are not.\n\nSo maybe we need to be at9 at turn28. How? We would have to be at8 at turn27 and then move up at turn27 to be at9 at turn28. But we start at6 at turn26.\n\nAt turn26: if we move U, then at turn27 we are at7.\nAt turn27: if we move U, then at turn28 we are at8.\nAt turn28: move U, then at turn29 we are at9.\n\nWe never are at9 at turn28.\n\nUnless we start at a higher position? We start at6.\n\nAnother possibility: maybe the initial position is at turn26, and we are allowed to not move and stay at6 for one turn, then move up three times? Then we would be at9 at turn30. Then if H=4, we would be at9 at turn30 = t1+4, and the condition requires at turn t1+H-1 = 26+3=29 to be at9? But at turn29 we would be at8 (if we moved up at turn28) or at9 if we moved up at turn29? Let's see:\n\nOption with waiting one turn:\n\n   Turn26: S -> at turn27: y=6\n   Turn27: U -> at turn28: y=7\n   Turn28: U -> at turn29: y=8\n   Turn29: U -> at turn30: y=9\n\nThen at turn29 (t1+3) we are at8, not9.\n\nWe would need to be at9 at turn29? Then we would have to be at8 at turn28 and move up at turn28 to be at9 at turn29. So:\n\n   Turn26: U -> turn27: y=7\n   Turn27: U -> turn28: y=8\n   Turn28: U -> turn29: y=9\n\nThis is the original three-move sequence, and at turn29 we are at9.\n\nThen if we set H=4, then the condition requires at turn26+4-1=29: y29=9. This matches.\n\nSo if we output three actions (H=3) then the sequence is for turns26,27,28 and then at turn29 we are at9, but the condition requires at turn28 (26+3-1=28) to be at9, which is not.\n\nIf we output four actions, then the last action is at turn29, and then at turn30 we are at9 or something else.\n\nBut we can do:\n\n   Turn26: U (-> y=7 at turn27)\n   Turn27: U (-> y=8 at turn28)\n   Turn28: U (-> y=9 at turn29)\n   Turn29: S (-> y=9 at turn30)\n\nThen at turn29 we are at9? No, at the beginning of turn29 we are at8, then we take U and at turn30 we are at9.\n\nWe are at9 at turn30.\n\nThe condition requires at turn26+H-1=26+4-1=29: we require y29=9, but we are at8 at turn29.\n\nAlternatively, if we do:\n\n   Turn26: U -> turn27:7\n   Turn27: U -> turn28:8\n   Turn28: U -> turn29:9\n   Then we are at9 at turn29. But then we have only taken three actions. To have four actions, we must do a fourth action at turn29.\n\n   Turn29: S -> turn30:9 (still at9)\n\n Then the beginning of turn29 is when we are at9? No: \n   - At the beginning of turn29, we are at9 (because after the action at turn28 we moved to9 at turn29).\n   - Then we take action S at turn29, and then at turn30 we are at9.\n\n So at the beginning of turn29, we are at9. \n\n Therefore, if we take H=4, then we require y_{26+4-1}=y_29=9, which is true.\n\n So the sequence is four actions:\n\n   Turn26: U\n   Turn27: U\n   Turn28: U\n   Turn29: S\n\n And at the beginning of turn29 (which is turn26+3) we are at9, and then we do S at turn29 to stay, and at turn30 we are still at9.\n\n But the condition is only for the beginning of turn29: y29=9, which is satisfied.\n\n Therefore, we need H=4 and the last action is S.\n\n But is this minimal? We could have reached in three actions to be at9 at turn29, but then we are not at9 at turn28. The condition requires at turn26+H-1=29 for H=4.\n\n However, with three actions, we are at9 at turn29, but then the turn26+H-1 for H=3 is turn28, and at turn28 we are at8, not9.\n\n Therefore, we must have H>=4.\n\n But note: the problem asks for the minimal number of turns H. With four actions, we are at9 at turn29 (the beginning) and then we do an action at turn29. But the condition is only for the state at turn29.\n\n So minimal H is 4.\n\n However, we can try to see if we can be at9 earlier? We start at6 at turn26. \n\n Can we be at9 at turn27? That would require two actions in one turn? No, only one action per turn.\n\n Can we be at9 at turn28? That would require three actions: at turn26,27,28. But then at the beginning of turn28 we are at8, and after action at turn28 we are at9 at turn29.\n\n So the earliest we can be at9 is at turn29.\n\n Therefore, the minimal H for which we can have y_{t1+H-1}=9 is when turn t1+H-1 = 29, so H-1 = 3, H=4.\n\n So we must use 4 actions.\n\n The first three actions are U, and the last action is S (or any, but S is fine).\n\n But we must check that during these actions, we avoid collisions.\n\n We have already checked the first three moves (UUU) for turns26,27,28. But now we have a fourth action at turn29.\n\n At turn29, we will be at y=9 (at the beginning of turn29), and then we do S, and then at turn30 we are at9. \n\n Since y=9 is not a freeway, we don't check collision at turn29 or turn30.\n\n But what about during the first three actions? Let's recap the states and turns:\n\n   Turn26: \n        - At beginning: y=6 -> check freeway6 at turn26: safe (as before)\n        - Action: U\n\n   Turn27:\n        - At beginning: y=7\n        - Check freeway7 at turn27: safe (as before)\n        - Action: U\n\n   Turn28:\n        - At beginning: y=8\n        - Check freeway8 at turn28: safe (as before)\n        - Action: U\n\n   Turn29:\n        - At beginning: y=9 -> not a freeway, no collision check.\n        - Action: S\n\n   Turn30: y=9.\n\n So the only new state is at turn29: we are at9, which is safe.\n\n Therefore, the sequence is safe.\n\n But is there a shorter sequence in terms of H? H=4.\n\n Can we be at9 at an earlier turn with the condition? For example, if we could be at9 at turn28, then H could be 3. But we can't.\n\n Therefore, minimal H is 4.\n\n So the answer is:\n\nTurn 26: U\nTurn 27: U\nTurn 28: U\nTurn 29: S\n\nBut note: the turns in the answer should be for turns 26 to 26+H-1 = 26+4-1=29.\n\n So we output:\n\nTurn 26: U\nTurn 27: U\nTurn 28: U\nTurn 29: S\n\nBut wait, is there a way to avoid the extra S? The condition is only that at turn t1+H-1=29 we are at9. We are at9 at the beginning of turn29. Then we take action S at turn29, but that doesn't change the state at the beginning of turn29. \n\nHowever, the problem requires a sequence of actions from t1 to t1+H-1, which is turns26 to29.\n\nAnd we are at9 at turn29 (beginning), which satisfies the condition.\n\nWe could do any action at turn29, but S is fine.\n\nAlternatively, we could do:\n\n   Turn26: U\n   Turn27: U\n   Turn28: U\n   Turn29: U   -> but then we try to go above9, which is not allowed, so we stay at9.\n\nBut the rules: y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t, and if we are at9 and do U, we stay at9. So U or S at turn29 are equivalent.\n\nSo we can do U as well. But S is explicitly allowed.\n\nNow, we must check if there is a sequence with H=4 that might be necessary for safety? But our three up moves are safe, and the fourth move is at y=9, so safe.\n\nBut is there a reason to do something else? For example, if we had to wait because of a car, but in this case, the path is clear.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 4.\n\nBut note: is there a sequence with H=3 that gets us to9 at turn28? We concluded it's impossible.\n\nOr is there a sequence that gets us to9 at an earlier turn? No.\n\nTherefore, we output the above.\n\nBut let me double-check the car positions for the turns we are on freeways: turns26 (y=6), turn27 (y=7), turn28 (y=8).\n\nFreeway 6 at turn26 (t=0):\n   Car1: [49,60] -> 0 not in [49,60]\n   Car2: [-29,-18] -> 0 not in [-29,-18]\n   Car3: [7,18] -> 0 not in [7,18]\n\nFreeway 7 at turn27 (t=1):\n   Car1: [49+6=55, 60+6=66] -> safe\n   Car2: [-29+6=-23, -18+6=-12] -> safe\n   Car3: [7+6=13, 18+6=24] -> safe\n\nFreeway 8 at turn28 (t=2):\n   Car1: [49+12=61, 60+12=72] -> safe\n   Car2: [-29+12=-17, -18+12=-6] -> 0 is not in [-17,-6] because the interval is from -17 to -6, which is below zero.\n   Car3: [7+12=19, 18+12=30] -> safe\n\nSo indeed safe.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 26: U\nTurn 27: U\nTurn 28: U\nTurn 29: S\n}\n\nBut note: the problem might have intended the condition to be at turn t1+H, but based on the stated condition, we must use H=4.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 6) at turn 26. The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) such that at the beginning of turn \\(26 + H - 1\\), the player is at \\(y = 9\\), while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis:\n- The player must move from \\(y = 6\\) to \\(y = 9\\), requiring at least 3 upward moves (U) to increase the y-coordinate by 3.\n- However, the condition \\(y_{26 + H - 1} = 9\\) means that at the beginning of turn \\(26 + H - 1\\), the player must be at \\(y = 9\\). \n- With \\(H\\) actions taken from turn 26 to turn \\(26 + H - 1\\), the position at the beginning of turn \\(26 + H - 1\\) results from the first \\(H - 1\\) actions.\n- To be at \\(y = 9\\) at the beginning of turn 29 (i.e., \\(26 + 3\\)), the player needs 3 upward moves by turn 28. This would set \\(y = 9\\) at the beginning of turn 29, satisfying the condition for \\(H = 4\\) (since \\(26 + 4 - 1 = 29\\)).\n\n### Collision Avoidance:\n- **Turn 26 (y = 6)**: \n  - Cars on freeway 6 at turn 26: \n    - (49, 60): span [49, 60], 0 not in span.\n    - (-29, -18): span [-29, -18], 0 not in span.\n    - (7, 18): span [7, 18], 0 not in span.\n  - Safe to stay or move.

Action: U, moving to y=9 at turn 29.\n- **Turn 29 (y = 9)**:\n  - At turn 29, the player is at y=9 (not a freeway, so no collision check).

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,7) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible without colliding with any cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. The cars are moving, and I have to avoid being on a freeway when a car is at position 0 at that turn.\n\nFirst, I should understand the car movements. All cars are moving right with speed 6, meaning they move 6 units to the right per turn. The position is given at turn t_1 = 27.\n\nFor each car, the span is given as (head, tail, direction, speed). For right-moving cars, head is the right end, tail is the left end. From the update rule:\n\nFor right-moving: Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nIn the table, it's listed as (head, tail, direction, speed). For right-moving, head is the front, so higher position, tail is lower.\n\nFor example, on freeway 1: cars: (-48, -59, right, 6) and (0, -11, right, 6)\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nCollision occurs if at turn T, I am on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, at position 0, it is within the span of some car, meaning 0 is between the tail and head inclusive at that turn.\n\nAlso, when I move, at turn T, I am on y_T, and I take action to go to y_{T+1}, so at turn T, I am on y_T, and I check collision on y_T at turn T.\n\nIf I stay on the same y, I am there every turn.\n\nBut if I move, I leave the current y and enter the new one only at the next turn.\n\nThe note says: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nSimilarly, I assume that for the current y, I am on it at turn T when I decide to move or stay.\n\nSo, at each turn T, I am on some y, and I take an action: U, D, or S, which changes y for the next turn, except S keeps it the same.\n\ny_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, so after action, position changes.\n\nAt the start of turn t, I am at position y_t. I take action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nThen, during turn t, I am at y_t, and I check if there is a car on freeway y_t at position 0 at time t.\n\nCollision occurs if at turn T, for the freeway y_T, 0 is within some car's span at time T.\n\nFor each freeway and each car, I need to compute when 0 is covered by that car.\n\nSince the cars move continuously, but we have discrete turns, and positions are integers? The spans are given with integers, and movement is per turn, so positions are discrete.\n\nThe grid is vertical axis y=0 to 9, but the cars are on horizontal freeways, I think, with positions like x-coordinate, but we only care about when x=0.\n\nThe freeway is a line, and cars have positions along that line.\n\nFor each freeway k, at time t, a car is present at position 0 if 0 is between the tail and head of that car at time t.\n\nFor a car, at time t, the span is [left, right] where for right-moving, left = τ + s(t - t_1), right = h + s(t - t_1)\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but all here are right-moving.\n\nIn this case, all cars are right-moving with speed 6.\n\nt_1 = 27.\n\nLet me denote Δt = t - 27, so for time t, Δt = t - 27.\n\nThen for a car with initial (h, τ, right, s) at t_1=27,\n\nAt time t, span: left = τ + s Δt, right = h + s Δt\n\nPosition 0 is covered if left <= 0 <= right.\n\nSince s=6 for all.\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need to find when position 0 is occupied by a car, meaning for some car, left <= 0 <= right at time t.\n\nThen, if I am on that freeway at time t, I collide.\n\nI am starting from y=7 at t=27.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\ny=9 is the goal, and it's not a freeway with cars, I think. Freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nThe player position is (0,y), so at x=0, and y from 0 to 9.\n\nCars are on freeways y=1 to 8, and we care about x=0.\n\ny=0 and y=9 have no cars, so safe.\n\nI start at (0,7) at t=27.\n\nI need to go to (0,9).\n\nI can move up, down, or stay.\n\nEach action changes y by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nNow, the minimal H should be small, since I'm at 7, need to go to 9, so at least 2 turns if I go up twice.\n\nBut I have to avoid collisions on freeways 7 and 8, since I start at 7.\n\ny=7 is a freeway, and y=8 is also.\n\nI need to check when cars are at x=0 on y=7 and y=8.\n\nFirst, let's list all cars for freeways 1 to 8.\n\nFrom the table:\n\nFreeway k | Cars\n\n1: (-48,-59,right,6), (0,-11,right,6)\n\n2: same as 1? \" (-48, -59, right, 6), (0, -11, right, 6) \" for k=1,2,3,4\n\nLet's see:\n\nFor k=1 to 4: each has two cars: car A: (-48,-59,right,6), car B: (0,-11,right,6)\n\nFor k=5 to 8: each has three cars: car A: (-48,-59,right,6), car B: (-12,-23,right,6), car C: (24,13,right,6)\n\nNow, for each car, compute when it covers x=0.\n\nFirst, for a car, at time t, with Δt = t - 27,\n\nleft = τ + 6 Δt\n\nright = h + 6 Δt\n\n0 covered if left <= 0 <= right\n\nSince h and τ are given, and for right-moving, head h is right end, tail τ is left end, so h > τ.\n\nIn the pairs, for example, (-48,-59), -48 > -59, so head -48, tail -59.\n\nSimilarly, (0,-11), 0 > -11.\n\nFor (24,13), 24 > 13? 24 is greater than 13, but in the span, it should be from left to right.\n\n(24,13), if head=24, tail=13, then left=13, right=24? But direction right, so moving right.\n\nIn the update: for right-moving, span at T is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nSo for car (h,τ,right,s), at t, position min = τ + s Δt, max = h + s Δt\n\n0 covered if min <= 0 <= max\n\nNow, let's compute for each car on relevant freeways.\n\nI am at y=7 at t=27.\n\nI need to consider freeways 7 and 8 mainly, since I start at 7 and need to go to 8 or 9.\n\nBut I might stay or move down, but moving down to y=6 might not help since I need to go up eventually.\n\nSince I need to go up, and time is critical, probably best to go up directly if possible.\n\nBut I have to avoid the times when cars are at x=0 on the freeways I am on.\n\nFirst, let's find for freeway 7, when is there a car at x=0.\n\nFreeway 7 has cars: A: (-48,-59,right,6), B: (-12,-23,right,6), C: (24,13,right,6)\n\nAt time t, Δt = t-27\n\nFor car A: min = τ + 6 Δt = -59 + 6 Δt\n\nmax = h + 6 Δt = -48 + 6 Δt\n\n0 covered if -59 + 6 Δt <= 0 <= -48 + 6 Δt\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nLet's solve the inequalities.\n\nFor car A: min <= 0 and 0 <= max\n\n-59 + 6 Δt <= 0 => 6 Δt <= 59 => Δt <= 59/6 ≈ 9.833, so Δt <= 9 since integer? Δt integer, t integer.\n\nt is turn number, so Δt integer.\n\nSimilarly, 0 <= -48 + 6 Δt => 6 Δt >= 48 => Δt >= 8\n\nSo for car A, covered when Δt >=8 and Δt <=9\n\nΔt=8: min = -59 + 48 = -11, max = -48 + 48 = 0\n\n0 <= max: 0 <= 0, yes, included.\n\nmin <=0: -11 <=0, yes.\n\nSo at Δt=8, covered.\n\nΔt=9: min = -59 + 54 = -5, max = -48 + 54 = 6\n\n-5 <=0 <=6, yes.\n\nΔt=10: min = -59 +60=1, max= -48+60=12, 1 <=0? 1 <=0 false, so 0 not covered.\n\nSimilarly, Δt=7: min= -59+42= -17, max= -48+42= -6, both negative, 0 not in [-17,-6].\n\nSo car A covers x=0 at Δt=8 and Δt=9 only.\n\nNow car B: (-12,-23,right,6)\n\nmin = τ +6Δt = -23 +6Δt\n\nmax = h +6Δt = -12 +6Δt\n\n0 covered if -23 +6Δt <=0 and 0 <= -12 +6Δt\n\nFirst: -23 +6Δt <=0 => 6Δt <=23 => Δt <= 23/6 ≈3.833, so Δt <=3\n\nSecond: 0 <= -12 +6Δt => 6Δt >=12 => Δt >=2\n\nSo Δt=2,3\n\nΔt=2: min= -23+12= -11, max= -12+12=0, 0 covered.\n\nΔt=3: min= -23+18= -5, max= -12+18=6, 0 covered.\n\nΔt=4: min= -23+24=1, max= -12+24=12, 1<=0 false.\n\nΔt=1: min= -23+6= -17, max= -12+6= -6, both neg, no.\n\nSo car B covers at Δt=2,3\n\nNow car C: (24,13,right,6)\n\nh=24, τ=13? Tail=13, head=24? But 13 to 24, moving right.\n\nmin = τ +6Δt =13 +6Δt\n\nmax = h +6Δt =24 +6Δt\n\n0 covered if 13 +6Δt <=0 and 0 <=24 +6Δt\n\nBut 13 +6Δt <=0, since 13>0 and Δt>=0, 13+6Δt >0, always false. So never covered.\n\nSimilarly, 0 <=24+6Δt always true for Δt>=0, but since first inequality false, never covered.\n\nSo for freeway 7, only cars A and B can cover x=0.\n\nCar A at Δt=8,9\n\nCar B at Δt=2,3\n\nΔt=0 is t=27, current time.\n\nAt t=27, Δt=0.\n\nFor freeway 7, at Δt=0, car B: min= -23 +0 = -23, max= -12 +0 = -12, both negative, 0 not covered.\n\nCar A: min=-59, max=-48, both neg, no.\n\nCar C: min=13, max=24, both pos, 0 not in.\n\nSo at t=27, no car at x=0 on y=7.\n\nBut I am at y=7 at t=27, and I need to take action.\n\nNow, for freeway 8, similar.\n\nFreeway 8 has same cars as 7, since k=5-8 all have same cars.\n\nk=5,6,7,8 all have: (-48,-59,right,6), (-12,-23,right,6), (24,13,right,6)\n\nSo for freeway 8, cars identical to freeway 7.\n\nSo same times: car B covers at Δt=2,3; car A at Δt=8,9; car C never.\n\nNow, I start at t=27, y=7.\n\nAt t=27, y=7, no car at x=0, so safe.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\ny=9 is safe, no cars.\n\nThe minimal path: go up to y=8 at some point, then to y=9.\n\nI could go directly to y=9 in one move? No, each action changes y by at most 1, so from 7 to 9, min two moves: e.g., U to 8, then U to 9.\n\nOr U to 8, then if not possible, S or something, but U U should be possible if I avoid collisions.\n\nI need to be on y=8 at some turn without collision, then from there to y=9.\n\nSince I start at y=7, I can stay or move.\n\nBut moving up immediately might be good.\n\nNow, at t=27, I am on y=7, no collision.\n\nIf I take action U at t=27, then at t=28, I will be at y=8.\n\nAt t=28, I am on y=8.\n\nNow, what about collision on y=8 at t=28?\n\nt=28, Δt = 28-27=1\n\nFor freeway 8, at Δt=1, is there a car at x=0?\n\nCar B: at Δt=1, min= -23 +6*1= -17, max= -12 +6= -6, both neg, no.\n\nCar A: min=-59+6=-53, max=-48+6=-42, both neg, no.\n\nCar C: min=13+6=19, max=24+6=30, both pos, no.\n\nSo at t=28, y=8, no car at x=0, safe.\n\nThen at t=28, I can take U to go to y=9 at t=29.\n\nAt t=29, I am on y=9, which is safe, no cars.\n\nThen I reached at t=29, with H=2 turns? Let's see.\n\nt=27: start at y=7\n\nAction a_{27}: say U\n\nThen y_{28} = 7 +1 =8\n\nAt t=28, I am on y=8, and no collision as above.\n\nThen action a_{28}: U\n\ny_{29} =8+1=9\n\nAt t=29, I am on y=9, safe.\n\nTotal turns: from t=27 to t=29, but H is the number of actions, I think.\n\nThe sequence is from t=0 to H-1, but here t_1 is 27.\n\nThe minimal number of turns H, and sequence {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nSo for H=2, actions at t=27 and t=28.\n\nThen at t=29, position is (0,9).\n\nThe position is reached at turn t_1 + H -1? Let's see.\n\nAt turn t, after action, position for next turn.\n\nAt turn t, I am at y_t, take action a_t, then y_{t+1} is set.\n\nSo after H actions, I am at turn t_1 + H.\n\nStart: at turn t_1, position y_{t_1}\n\nAfter action a_{t_1}, at turn t_1+1, position y_{t_1+1}\n\n...\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t_1 + H, position y_{t_1 + H}\n\nWe want y_{t_1 + H} =9? But the sequence is to reach at turn t_1 + H -1?\n\nI think I need to clarify.\n\nFrom the problem: \"reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1\"\n\n\"such that y_{t_1 + H - 1} =9\"\n\nLet's read:\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9), meaning y_{t_1 + H -1} =9\"\n\nFor example, if H=1, actions at t_1, then y_{t_1 +1} should be 9? No.\n\nAt turn t_1, position y_{t_1}, take action a_{t_1}, which sets y_{t_1 +1}.\n\nThen at turn t_1 +1, position y_{t_1 +1}.\n\nWe want y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nFor H=1: sequence with one action, a_{t_1}, then y_{t_1 +1} should be 9? But y_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{t_1 +1 -1} = y_{t_1} for H=1.\n\ny_{t_1 + H -1} for H=1 is y_{t_1}, which is 7, not 9.\n\nSo H=1 is impossible.\n\nH=2: sequence a_{t_1} and a_{t_1 +1}, then y_{t_1 + 2 -1} = y_{t_1 +1} should be 9.\n\nSimilarly, y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nIn terms of turns: after H actions, the position at turn t_1 + H -1 is set to 9.\n\nFor H=2, y_{t_1 +1} =9.\n\nFor example, at t_1=27, I want y_{28} =9.\n\nCurrently y_{27}=7.\n\nSo I need to go from 7 to 9 in one step? But actions change by at most 1, so impossible to go from 7 to 9 in one action. Each action changes y by -1,0, or +1, so from 7, after one action, y can be 6,7,8, not 9.\n\nAfter two actions: from 7, after first action to say 8, then second to 9, so y_{28} =8 or 9, but to have y_{28}=9, I need to be at 8 at t=27 after action? Let's think carefully.\n\nAt turn t_1=27: position y_{27}=7\n\nI take action a_{27}, which determines y_{28} = y_{27} + Δy\n\nThen at turn 28, position y_{28}, I take action a_{28}, which determines y_{29} = y_{28} + Δy\n\nAnd so on.\n\ny_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nFor H=2, y_{27 + 2 -1} = y_{28} =9.\n\nSo I need y_{28} =9.\n\nBut y_{28} is set by action at t=27: y_{28} = y_{27} + Δy_{27}\n\ny_{27}=7, so y_{28} = 7 + Δy, which can be 6,7,8. Cannot be 9. Max 8.\n\nSo impossible to have y_{28}=9.\n\nSimilarly, y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nFor H=2, it is y_{28}, which cannot be 9 from y_{27}=7.\n\nH=3: y_{27 +3 -1} = y_{29} =9\n\ny_{29} can be 9 if I go up twice.\n\nFor example, at t=27, take U, y_{28}=8\n\nThen at t=28, take U, y_{29}=9\n\nThen at turn t=29, position is (0,9), which is what we want.\n\nSimilarly, if H=3, we reach at turn 29.\n\nNow, back to earlier.\n\nAt t=27, y=7, no collision.\n\nIf I take U at t=27, then y_{28}=8.\n\nAt t=28, I am on y=8.\n\nAs computed, at t=28, Δt=1, no car at x=0 on y=8, safe.\n\nThen at t=28, I take U, so y_{29}=9.\n\nThen done in H=3 turns? H is the number of actions.\n\nSequence: a_{27}, a_{28}, so for H=2? No.\n\nH= number of turns, meaning number of actions.\n\nSequence from t=0 to H-1 relative to t_1.\n\nFor H=2, actions at t_1 and t_1+1, then y_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{t_1 +1} for H=2.\n\nBut y_{t_1 +1} cannot be 9 from y_{t_1}=7.\n\nSo min H must be at least 3.\n\nWith H=3, actions at t=27,28,29? No.\n\nActions {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nSo for H=3, actions at t_1 +0, t_1 +1, t_1 +2.\n\nThen y_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{t_1 + 3 -1} = y_{t_1 +2}\n\nSet to 9.\n\nIn this case, t_1=27, y_{29}=9.\n\nActions: a_{27} and a_{28} determine the moves to get there.\n\nSpecifically, with a_{27}: U, y_{28}=8\n\na_{28}: U, y_{29}=9\n\nNow, at t=27, when I take action, I am on y=7, safe.\n\nAt t=28, I am on y=8, and we saw at t=28, Δt=1, no car on y=8 at x=0, safe.\n\nThen at t=28, I take action U, and at t=29, I am on y=9, safe.\n\nSo it seems possible in H=3 with actions U at t=27 and U at t=28.\n\nBut the sequence is for t from t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nIn the answer, it should be:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\n\nTurn t_1+1: a_{t_1+1}\n\n...\n\nUp to turn t_1 + H -1: a_{t_1 + H -1}\n\nAnd with these actions, at turn t_1 + H -1, position is 9.\n\nIn this case, for H=3, actions at t=27,28,29? No.\n\nLet's index properly.\n\nThe actions are a_{t} for t = t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nFor example, with H=3, actions a_{27}, a_{28}, a_{29}? But a_{29} is taken at turn 29, which affects y_{30}, but we only care up to y_{29}=9.\n\ny_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{29} for H=3.\n\nAt turn 29, position y_{29} is already set, and we don't take action after that for reaching.\n\nThe sequence of actions is up to the point that after H actions, position at turn t_1 + H -1 is 9.\n\nThe last action is at turn t_1 + H -2? Let's see.\n\nStart at turn t_1, position y_{t_1}\n\nAction a_{t_1} at turn t_1: sets y_{t_1 +1}\n\nAction a_{t_1 +1} at turn t_1 +1: sets y_{t_1 +2}\n\n...\n\nAction a_{t_1 + k} at turn t_1 + k: sets y_{t_1 + k +1}\n\nAfter m actions, we have set y_{t_1 +1} to y_{t_1 + m}\n\nThe position at turn t is y_t.\n\nWe want y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nThis is set by the actions up to a_{t_1 + H -2}, because:\n\ny_{t_1 + H -1} is set by action a_{t_1 + H -2} at turn t_1 + H -2.\n\nFor example, to have y_{29} =9 for t_1=27.\n\ny_{29} is set by action at turn 28: a_{28} sets y_{29} = y_{28} + Δy_{28}\n\nBut y_{28} is set by a_{27}, and so on.\n\nThe action that directly sets y_{29} is a_{28}.\n\nBut the position y_{29} is the state at turn 29.\n\nThe sequence of actions to take: from turn t_1 to turn t_1 + H -1, we take actions, and at the end of these actions, at turn t_1 + H -1, position is 9.\n\nFor H=3, actions at t=27,28,29? But at turn 29, taking action sets y_{30}, which is after.\n\nI think I confused the indexing.\n\nLet me read the problem carefully.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9), meaning y_{t_1 + H -1} =9\"\n\nAnd \"a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1\" so actions at times t_1 +0, t_1 +1, ..., t_1 + H-1.\n\nEach action a_t is taken at turn t, and sets y_{t+1}.\n\nSo after taking a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H-1}, we have set y_{t_1 +1} to y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nThe position at turn t_1 + H is y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nBut we want position at turn t_1 + H -1 to be 9.\n\ny_{t_1 + H -1} is the position before taking action a_{t_1 + H -1}.\n\nAt turn t_1 + H -1, position is y_{t_1 + H -1}, which should be 9.\n\nThen we take action a_{t_1 + H -1}, which sets y_{t_1 + H}, but we don't care about that.\n\nFor example, to have y_{29} =9 for t_1=27.\n\nAt turn 29, position is 9, so we are done.\n\nThe actions taken are from turn t_1 to turn t_1 + H -2 to move to that position, and at turn t_1 + H -1, we might take an action, but since we are already at 9, we can take S or whatever, but the position is already 9 at that turn.\n\nIn the sequence, for H, we include actions from t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nBut for the position at t_1 + H -1 to be 9, it must be set by previous actions.\n\nSpecifically, y_{t_1 + H -1} is set by action a_{t_1 + H -2} at turn t_1 + H -2.\n\nThen at turn t_1 + H -1, we are at y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, and we take action a_{t_1 + H -1}, which might change it, but since we only care about reaching at that turn, we can take an action that keeps it or moves, but to be at 9 at that turn, we need to be there before the action.\n\nThe position is evaluated at the start of the turn or after action?\n\nI think I need to clarify the turn structure.\n\nFrom the game dynamics:\n\nAt turn t, the player is at position y_t.\n\nThen collision is checked based on y_t and the cars at time t.\n\nThen the player takes action a_t, which determines y_{t+1} for the next turn.\n\nSo at turn t, we have:\n\n- Position y_t\n\n- Check collision for (y_t, t)\n\n- Take action a_t, set y_{t+1}\n\nThen turn t+1, and so on.\n\nReaching (0,9) at turn T means that at turn T, y_T =9, and no collision at that turn if on freeway, but y=9 no freeway, so safe.\n\nIn this case, for y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, at turn t_1 + H -1, we are at y=9.\n\nThe actions are taken from turn t_1 to turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nThe action at turn t_1 + H -1 is taken at that turn, but it affects y_{t_1 + H}, not the current position.\n\nTo have y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, it must be that the actions up to a_{t_1 + H -2} have brought us to 9 at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nThen at turn t_1 + H -1, we are at 9, take some action, but since we are at 9, and we take a_{t_1 + H -1}, which might move us away, but the position at that turn is 9, so we have reached.\n\nFor example, with t_1=27, to reach at turn 29, y_29=9.\n\nActions: at turn 27, take a_27, sets y_28\n\nAt turn 28, take a_28, sets y_29\n\nAt turn 29, take a_29, sets y_30\n\nBut at turn 29, position y_29 is set by previous actions, and we want y_29=9.\n\nSo to have y_29=9, we need a_27 and a_28 such that from y_27=7, we go to y_29=9.\n\nFor instance, a_27=U, y_28=8; a_28=U, y_29=9.\n\nThen at turn 29, y_29=9, we are at (0,9).\n\nThen we take action a_29, but it doesn't affect the position at turn 29.\n\nIn the sequence, for H=3, we have actions at t=27,28,29.\n\nBut a_29 is not necessary for reaching at turn 29, but since the sequence includes it, we can choose a_29=S or U or D, but to be safe, S is fine.\n\nSimilarly, in general, for reaching at turn T, we need actions up to T-1 to set y_T, and at turn T, we take an action, but the position is already reached.\n\nNow back to the collision.\n\nIn my plan, at t=27, I am at y=7, no collision.\n\nTake a_27=U, so y_28=8.\n\nThen at t=28, I am at y=8.\n\nIs there collision at t=28 on y=8?\n\nAs before, Δt=28-27=1, for y=8, cars: min and max as before.\n\nCar B: min=-23+6*1=-17, max=-12+6=-6, 0 not in [-17,-6]\n\nCar A: min=-59+6=-53, max=-48+6=-42, no\n\nCar C: min=13+6=19, max=24+6=30, no\n\nSo no car at x=0, safe.\n\nThen I take a_28=U, so y_29=9.\n\nAt t=29, I am at y=9, safe.\n\nThen for the sequence, with H=3, actions: a_27=U, a_28=U, and a_29 can be S, since we are done.\n\nBut the position is reached at turn 29 with y_29=9.\n\nNow, but earlier I thought about freeway 7 at other times, but in this case, I only was on y=7 at t=27 and y=8 at t=28, both safe.\n\nBut what about freeway 6 or others? I didn't go there, so no issue.\n\nIn this path, I only visit y=7 and y=8, at t=27 and t=28 respectively.\n\nt=27: y=7, t=28: y=8, both safe as per above.\n\nBut let me confirm the car times for other freeways, but since I don't visit, irrelevant.\n\nBut just to be thorough.\n\nFor example, on freeway 7, car B covers at Δt=2,3, which is t=29 and t=30.\n\nBut at t=29, I am at y=9, not on freeway 7.\n\nSimilarly, car A at Δt=8,9, t=35,36, far away.\n\nSimilarly for y=8, same.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nBut is there a way with H=2?\n\nH=2: actions at t=27 and t=28.\n\nThen y_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{27+2-1} = y_{28} should be 9.\n\nBut from y_27=7, after one action, y_28 can be at most 8, cannot be 9. So impossible.\n\nThus minimal H=3.\n\nWith actions U at t=27 and U at t=28, we get to y=9 at t=29.\n\nThen for the sequence, we need to specify a_{29} as well, but since H=3, we include three actions.\n\na_{29} can be S, for example.\n\nIn the sequence, it should be fine.\n\nBut let's see the answer format.\n\nIt should be:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\n\nTurn t_1 +1: a_{t_1 +1}\n\n...\n\nTurn t_1 + H-1: a_{t_1 + H-1}\n\nFor H=3, t_1=27,\n\nTurn 27: U\n\nTurn 28: U\n\nTurn 29: S (or U or D, but S is safe)\n\nBut do we need to specify action at turn 29? Since we reach at turn 29, and action at turn 29 sets y_30, which is beyond, so it doesn't affect reaching at turn 29. But since the sequence includes it, we must provide an action. S is fine.\n\nTo minimize actions, but H is fixed for the sequence.\n\nAnother thing: in the car state, for freeways 1-4, there are cars that might be at x=0 at some times, but since I don't go there, no issue.\n\nBut in this case, it seems straightforward.\n\nBut let me double-check freeway 8 at t=28.\n\nt=28, Δt=1, as above.\n\nPerhaps I should compute explicitly.\n\nt=28, time from start: t-27=1\n\nFor freeway 8, car A: min = τ + s Δt = -59 + 6*1 = -53, max = h + s Δt = -48 +6 = -42, so span [-53,-42], 0 not in.\n\nCar B: min = τ + s Δt = -23 +6 = -17, max = h + s Δt = -12 +6 = -6, span [-17,-6], 0 not in.\n\nCar C: min=13+6=19, max=24+6=30, span [19,30], 0 not in.\n\nNo car at x=0.\n\nSimilarly at t=27, y=7: Δt=0\n\nCar B: min=-23, max=-12, span [-23,-12], no 0.\n\nCar A: min=-59, max=-48, no.\n\nCar C: min=13, max=24, no.\n\nSafe.\n\nSo with U at t=27 and U at t=28, I go to y=8 at t=28, then to y=9 at t=29.\n\nAt t=29, I take S or U, but S is fine.\n\nBut in the sequence for H=3, we have three actions.\n\nPerhaps I can reach in fewer? H=3 is minimal since from 7 to 9, min two moves, but with H=2, we need y_{28}=9, impossible.\n\ny_{t_1 + H -1} for H=2 is y_{28}, which must be 9, impossible from 7.\n\nSo H=3 is minimal.\n\nBut with the actions above, it works.\n\nBut in the car list, for freeway 5-8, there is car C (24,13), which never covers 0, so fine.\n\nBut for freeway 1-4, they have different cars: only two cars each, both with negative positions at t=27.\n\nFor example, freeway 1: cars (-48,-59,right,6) and (0,-11,right,6)\n\nAt t=27, Δt=0, car B: min=-11, max=0, so at min=-11, max=0, so 0 <= max is true, min<=0 true, so at t=27, on freeway 1, car B covers x=0? min=-11, max=0, so 0 is included, since 0 <= max.\n\nSimilarly, at t=27, for freeway 1, car B: at Δt=0, min=τ = -11, max=h=0, so span [-11,0], and 0 is included, so there is a car at x=0 at t=27 on y=1.\n\nSimilarly for y=2,3,4.\n\nBut I am not on those freeways, so no issue.\n\nIn my path, I am only on y=7 and y=8.\n\ny=7 and y=8 are freeways 7 and 8, which at t=27 and t=28 have no car at x=0.\n\nSo should be fine.\n\nBut let me confirm if at t=28, on y=8, is there any car?\n\nAs above, no.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if I need to wait or something, but not necessary.\n\nAnother thing: the player update: when I move, at turn T, I am on y_T, and if I move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T, then at turn T, I am not on y_{T+1}, so for collision, only y_T matters.\n\nIn this case, at t=27, I am on y=7, move to y=8, so at t=27, I am on y=7.\n\nAt t=28, on y=8.\n\nNo collision.\n\nSo I think it's ok.\n\nBut in the car list for freeway 5-8, car B is (-12,-23,right,6), which at Δt=2,3 covers, but t=29,30.\n\nNot at t=27 or 28.\n\nSo for t=28, Δt=1, not covered.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo with H=3, actions: a_{27}=U, a_{28}=U, and a_{29}=S.\n\nBut in the sequence, since we reach at turn 29, and a_{29} is taken, but it doesn't affect, so we can put S.\n\nTo be precise, the minimal H is 3, and sequence U,U,S.\n\nBut is there a problem?\n\nI think I missed something.\n\nFreeway 8 at t=28 is fine.\n\nBut let me list all times when cars are at x=0 for y=7 and y=8.\n\nSince y=7 and y=8 have same car configuration.\n\nCars: A: (-48,-59,right,6), covers when Δt=8,9 (t=35,36)\n\nB: (-12,-23,right,6), covers when Δt=2,3 (t=29,30)\n\nC: (24,13,right,6), never covers.\n\nSo at t=27, Δt=0: no cover\n\nt=28, Δt=1: no cover\n\nt=29, Δt=2: car B covers, min=-23+12=-11, max=-12+12=0? min= τ +6Δt = -23 +12 = -11? Δt=2, 6*2=12.\n\nmin = -23 + 12 = -11, max = -12 + 12 =0? h = -12? Car B: head=-12, tail=-23.\n\nSo min = tail + s Δt = -23 + 6*2 = -23 + 12 = -11\n\nmax = head + s Δt = -12 + 12 = 0\n\nSo span [-11,0], 0 covered.\n\nSimilarly at t=30, Δt=3, min=-23+18=-5, max=-12+18=6, 0 covered.\n\nBut at t=29, if I were on y=7 or y=8, I would collide, but in my plan, at t=29, I am at y=9, not on freeway.\n\nSimilarly, at t=28, on y=8, Δt=1, min=-23+6=-17, max=-12+6=-6, no 0.\n\nSo fine.\n\nTherefore, with actions: at t=27: U, go to y=8\n\nAt t=28: U, go to y=9\n\nAt t=29: S, stay or whatever.\n\nBut in the sequence for H=3.\n\nNow, the answer should be:\n\nTurn 27: U\n\nTurn 28: U\n\nTurn 29: S\n\nBut since we reached at turn 29, and S is safe.\n\nPerhaps I can have H=3 with different actions, but this seems minimal.\n\nAnother thing: the initial position is (0,7) at turn t_1=27.\n\nAnd I need to output the sequence.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 1-4, at t=27, there is a car at x=0, but I am not there.\n\nFor example, freeway 1: car (0,-11,right,6), at t=27, min=-11, max=0, so car present.\n\nBut y=1, not where I am.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nBut the problem is to avoid collisions when on freeways, which I did.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if I can do it in H=3 but with staying or something, but not necessary.\n\nMaybe I can go down, but that would take more turns, not minimal.\n\nSo minimal H is 3.\n\nNow, for the sequence, actions at t=27,28,29.\n\na_{27}=U, a_{28}=U, a_{29}=S\n\nBut in the answer format, it should be:\n\n\\boxed{  \nTurn 27: U  \nTurn 28: U  \nTurn 29: S  \n}\n\nBut let me write with subscripts.\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} = U\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1} = U\n\nTurn t_1 + 2: a_{t_1 + 2} = S  (since H=3, t from 0 to 2, so t_1 to t_1+2)\n\nt_1 + H -1 = 27 + 3 -1 = 29, so actions from t_1 to t_1 + 2.\n\nYes.\n\nPerhaps I can set a_{29} to U, but that would go to y=10, but y=10 is invalid, y must be in [0,9], so if at y=9, U would try to go to 10, but y_{t+1} must be in [0,9], so probably it stays or clips, but from the dynamics: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, and y_{t+1} must be in [0,9], so if y_t=9, U would make y_{t+1}=10, which is invalid, so probably not allowed or clipped, but to be safe, better to take S at y=9.\n\nSimilarly, D at y=0.\n\nIn this case, at t=29, y=9, so S is safe and valid.\n\nSo I think this is the answer.\n\nBut the player is at (0,7) at turn 27, and we need to reach (0,9) at turn 29.\n\nWith actions above.\n\nBut in the sequence, a_{29} is taken at turn 29, but since we are already at 9, it's fine.\n\nTo confirm H: with two actions, impossible to reach y=9 from y=7 in one step.\n\nSo H=3 is minimal.\n\nThus, the minimal H is 3, with sequence U, U, S.\n\nNow for the output.\n\nBut let me write it properly.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 7) at turn \\(t_1 = 27\\). The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis\n- From the initial position \\(y = 7\\), reaching \\(y = 9\\) requires at least two upward moves (U actions), as each action changes the vertical position by at most 1.\n- With \\(H = 2\\), the position at turn \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 27 + 2 - 1 = 28\\) must be 9. However, from \\(y_{27} = 7\\), after one action, \\(y_{28}\\) can be at most 8 (with U), so \\(y_{28} = 9\\) is impossible. Thus, \\(H = 2\\) is infeasible.\n- The minimal \\(H\\) is 3, meaning the position at turn \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 27 + 3 - 1 = 29\\) should be 9. This can be achieved with two upward moves: U at turn 27 to reach \\(y_{28} = 8\\), and U at turn 28 to reach \\(y_{29} = 9\\).\n- Collision avoidance:\n  - At turn 27, the player is on freeway \\(y = 7\\). The cars on freeway 7 (and identically on freeway 8, as per the car state) are:\n    - Car A: \\((-48, -59, \\text{right}, 6)\\), covers \\(x=0\\) at \\(\\Delta t = 8, 9\\) (turns 35, 36)\n    - Car B: \\((-12, -23, \\text{right}, 6)\\), covers \\(x=0\\) at \\(\\Delta t = 2, 3\\) (turns 29, 30)\n    - Car C: \\((24, 13, \\text{right}, 6)\\), never covers \\(x=0\\)\n  - At turn 27 (\\(\\Delta t = 0\\)):\n    - Car A: min = \\(-59 + 6 \\cdot 0 = -59\\), max = \\(-48 + 6 \\cdot 0 = -48\\), span \\([-59, -48]\\), 0 not in span\n    - Car B: min = \\(-23 + 6 \\cdot 0 = -23\\), max = \\(-12 + 6 \\cdot 0 = -12\\), span \\([-23, -12]\\), 0 not in span\n    - No collision on \\(y = 7\\).\n  - At turn 28 (\\(\\Delta t = 1\\)):\n    - Player moves to \\(y = 8\\) (via U at turn 27), so position is now on freeway \\(y = 8\\).\n    - Cars on \\(y = 8\\) (same as \\(y = 7\\)):\n      - Car A: min = \\(-59 + 6 \\cdot 1 = -53\\), max = \\(-48 + 6 \\cdot 1 = -42\\), span \\([-53, -42]\\), 0 not in span\n      - Car B: min = \\(-23 + 6 \\cdot 1 = -17\\), max = \\(-12 + 6 \\cdot 1 = -6\\), span \\([-17, -6]\\), 0 not in span\n      - Car C: min = \\(13 + 6 \\cdot 1 = 19\\), max = \\(24 + 6 \\cdot 1 = 30\\), span \\([19, 30]\\), 0 not in span\n    - No collision on \\(y = 8\\).\n- At turn 29, the player is at \\(y = 9\\), which has no cars and is safe.\n- The action at turn 29 is set to S (stay) since \\(y = 9\\) is the goal and moving up would attempt to go to \\(y = 10\\), which is invalid; S keeps the position at 9 safely.\n\n### Sequence\n- \\(H = 3\\) (actions at turns 27, 28, and 29).\n- Actions:\n  - Turn 27: U (move up to \\(y = 8\\))\n  - Turn 28: U (move up to \\(y = 9\\))\n  - Turn 29: S (stay at \\(y = 9\\))\n\nThis sequence reaches (0, 9) at turn 29 with no collisions, and \\(H = 3\\) is minimal.\n\n\\boxed{  \nTurn 27: U \\\\  \nTurn 28: U \\\\  \nTurn 29: S  \n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,8) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible without colliding with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The player is at y=8 at turn t1=28. I need to reach y=9, which is not a freeway, so no cars there, so once I'm at y=9, I'm safe. But I have to avoid cars on y=1 to y=8 when I'm on those rows.\n\nThe collision condition: at turn T, if I'm on y_T, and for that freeway, if 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway at turn T, then I collide. But note that when I move to a new row, I'm not considered on that row until the next turn. Let me read carefully.\n\n\"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd the note: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nSo, at turn T, I am on row y_T. If I choose an action that changes row, say to y_{T+1}, then at turn T, I am still on y_T, and I might collide with cars on y_T if 0 is in their span at T. Then, at turn T+1, I am on y_{T+1}, and I might collide with cars there.\n\nBut for the row I'm moving to, since I arrive at T+1, I only care about the car positions at T+1 for that row.\n\nNow, the cars are moving. All cars are right-moving, from the state.\n\nLet me list the cars for each freeway.\n\nFreeway 1: cars: (-42,-53,right,6), (6,-5,right,6)\n\nFreeway 2: same as freeway 1? The table says for each k, but it has multiple cars per freeway.\n\nLooking: | Freeway k | Cars ... |\n\nFor k=1 to 8, each has a list of cars.\n\nk=1: (-42,-53,right,6), (6,-5,right,6)\n\nk=2: same: (-42,-53,right,6), (6,-5,right,6)\n\nk=3: same\n\nk=4: same\n\nk=5: (-42,-53,right,6), (-6,-17,right,6), (30,19,right,6)\n\nk=6: same as k=5\n\nk=7: same\n\nk=8: same as k=5\n\nk=8 has three cars: (-42,-53,right,6), (-6,-17,right,6), (30,19,right,6)\n\nBut for k=1 to 4, only two cars each.\n\nNow, all are right-moving with speed 6.\n\nThe player is at (0,8) at turn t1=28.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\ny=8 is a freeway, so I have to be careful when on y=8.\n\nBut I start at y=8 at turn 28, so I might be at risk if 0 is in the span of a car on y=8 at turn 28.\n\nFirst, let's compute the car positions at turn t=28 for each freeway.\n\nThe car positions are given at turn t1=28, I think. The state is at turn t1, so the car spans are as given for turn t1.\n\nThe car state is given for turn t1, I believe.\n\nIt says: \"Car State\" at turn t1, with head, tail, etc.\n\nSo at turn 28, for each freeway, the car spans are as listed.\n\nNow, for a right-moving car, span is [τ, h] with τ < h, I assume, since it's moving right.\n\nIn the update: for right-moving, span at T is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nSimilarly for left, but all are right here.\n\nSo at time T, position is offset by s*(T-t1).\n\nt1=28.\n\nFirst, for freeway y=8, since I'm on it at turn 28.\n\ny=8 has cars: (-42,-53,right,6), (-6,-17,right,6), (30,19,right,6)\n\nAt turn 28, t1=28, so T=t1=28, offset s(28-28)=0, so spans are as given.\n\nNow, check if 0 is in any span.\n\nFirst car: [-53, -42]? Head and tail: it says (head h, tail τ, direction, speed)\n\nFor right-moving, span should be [τ, h] if τ < h.\n\nIn the car state: for k=8, cars: (-42,-53,right,6), (-6,-17,right,6), (30,19,right,6)\n\nNow, head and tail: for the first one, h=-42, τ=-53. Since right-moving, τ should be left, h right, so τ < h, so span is [τ, h] = [-53, -42]\n\nSimilarly, second car: h=-6, τ=-17, so τ=-17, h=-6, so [-17, -6]\n\nThird car: h=30, τ=19, so [19,30]\n\nNow, is 0 in any of these?\n\n[-53,-42]: 0 not in, since -42 < 0? -42 is negative, so max is -42 <0, so 0 not in.\n\n[-17,-6]: -17 to -6, all negative, -6 <0, so 0 not in.\n\n[19,30]: 19 to 30, all positive, 19>0, so 0 not in.\n\nSo at turn 28, on y=8, no car at position 0, so I am safe at start.\n\nNow, I need to reach y=9. Since y=9 is the top, and I'm at y=8, I can just go up one step, but I need to make sure that when I move, I don't collide.\n\nActions: U, D, S.\n\nU: y increases by 1, D: decreases by 1, S: stay same.\n\ny from 0 to 9, so at y=8, U goes to 9, D to 7, S stays 8.\n\nI want to go to y=9, so ideally, I can just do U at turn 28, then at turn 29, I am at y=9, and done.\n\nBut I need to check if that causes collision.\n\nAt turn 28, I am on y=8. Since no car at 0, I am safe.\n\nThen I choose action U. So at turn 28, I move to y=9? No.\n\nThe update: after action, y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nAt turn t, I am at position (0, y_t), I choose action a_t, then at turn t+1, I am at (0, y_{t+1}).\n\nWhen I choose action at turn t, it affects where I am at t+1.\n\nCollision is checked at each turn based on where I am.\n\nAt turn t, I am on row y_t. If 0 is in the span of a car on that row at time t, I collide.\n\nNow, when I choose to move to a different row, at turn t, I am still on y_t, so collision depends on cars on y_t at time t.\n\nThen, at turn t+1, I am on y_{t+1}, so collision depends on cars on y_{t+1} at time t+1.\n\nIn this case, at turn 28, I am on y=8, no collision, as we saw.\n\nIf I choose U at turn 28, then at turn 29, I am on y=9.\n\ny=9 has no cars, since freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=9 is safe, no cars.\n\nSo, I reach y=9 at turn 29 with one action: U at turn 28.\n\nBut is that correct? Turn count: from turn t1=28, I need to specify actions from t=28 to t=28+H-1, and y_{t1+H-1} =9.\n\nHere, if at turn 28 I do U, then at turn 29 I am at y=9, so H=1? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence is {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nt starts from 0.\n\nSo for t=0, a_{t1 +0} = a_28.\n\nThen after H actions, I am at turn t1 + H, position y_{t1 + H}.\n\nWe want y_{t1 + H -1} =9? Let's read.\n\n\"reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H -1\"\n\n\" a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H -1\"\n\nAfter the actions from t=0 to H-1, which are a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H -1}, the position after these actions is y_{t1 + H}.\n\nBut it says \"reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H -1\"\n\nTurn t1 + H -1.\n\nAfter k actions, I am at turn t1 + k.\n\nFor example, at turn t1, before any action, position is given.\n\nAfter first action at t1, I am at turn t1+1, position y_{t1+1}.\n\nAfter second action at t1+1, at turn t1+2, and so on.\n\nAfter H actions, I am at turn t1 + H.\n\nBut we want to be at (0,9) at turn t1 + H -1.\n\nt1 + H -1 is the turn after (H-1) actions.\n\nLet me define:\n\nAt turn T, position y_T.\n\nAction a_T is chosen, then y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy_T.\n\nAfter action at T, next turn T+1.\n\nThe sequence of actions from t=0 to H-1: a_{t1}, a_{t1+1}, ..., a_{t1 + H -1}\n\nAfter these actions, the last position is y_{t1 + H}\n\nBut we want y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\ny_{t1 + H -1} is the position at the start of turn t1 + H -1, before action a_{t1 + H -1}.\n\nAfter applying a_{t1 + H -1}, we go to y_{t1 + H}.\n\nBut we want the position at turn t1 + H -1 to be 9.\n\nThat is, before the action at that turn, or after?\n\n\"reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H -1\"\n\nI think \"at turn T\" means position at the beginning of turn T, before action.\n\nBut in terms of collision, position at turn T is used for collision check at that turn.\n\nIn the context, \"at turn T\" refers to the state at that turn.\n\nFor example, current state at turn t1: position (0, y_{t1})\n\nAfter actions, we want to be at position (0,9) at some turn.\n\nIt says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H -1\"\n\nAnd \"y_{t1 + H -1} =9\"\n\nIn the sequence, we have actions from t=0 to H-1, which affect turns from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nAfter action a_{t1 + k} at turn t1+k, we go to turn t1+k+1.\n\nThe position at turn t1 + k is y_{t1 + k}, which is determined before action a_{t1 + k}.\n\nFor k from 0 to H-1, actions at turns t1 to t1+H-1 change the position to y_{t1+1} to y_{t1+H}.\n\nWe want y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nThat means at turn t1 + H -1, before action, we are at (0,9).\n\nSince we are at (0,9), and no action needed, but we might need to specify the action for that turn? No.\n\nThe sequence is for t=0 to H-1, actions a_{t1} to a_{t1+H-1}.\n\nIf at turn t1 + H -1, we are at y=9, we don't necessarily need to do an action, but the sequence includes an action for each turn from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nBut if we are at y=9 at turn t1+H-1, and we want to stay or something, but the goal is to be at (0,9), so once there, we can stop, but the actions are for moving there.\n\nPerhaps for the turn where we reach, we might not need an action if we are already there, but in this setup, at each turn we must choose an action.\n\nBut y=9 is the target, and it's safe.\n\nIn this case, for me to be at y=9 at turn t1+H-1, that means before action at that turn, I am at y=9.\n\nThen, if I choose S, I stay, or U or D, but U would go to 10, but y max 9, so U from 9 might not be allowed, or it stays, but according to the dynamics, y in [0,9], so if at 9, U might be invalid, or it stays, but the equation says y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, with y in [0,9], so probably if at 9 and U, it stays 9, similarly for 0 and D.\n\nBut in this case, since we want to reach, we can choose to stay or not.\n\nBut minimal turns, so we want to get there as soon as possible.\n\nBack to the point: if I am at y=8 at turn 28, and I do U at turn 28, then at turn 29, I am at y=9.\n\nNow, at turn 28, I am at y=8, and I do action U.\n\nAfter action, at turn 29, y=9.\n\nWe want to be at (0,9) at turn t1 + H -1.\n\nt1=28.\n\nIf H=1, then t1 + H -1 = 28 +1 -1 =28.\n\nBut at turn 28, I am at y=8, not 9.\n\nIf I do nothing, I stay at 8.\n\nWith H actions, the position at turn t1 + H -1 is y_{t1 + H -1}.\n\nFor H=1, t1 + H -1 = t1 +1 -1 = t1 =28, y_{28} =8, not 9.\n\nTo have y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nFor example, if I do action at turn 28, go to y_{29}=9, then at turn 29, I am at 9.\n\nSo for turn t=29, y_29=9.\n\nt1 + H -1 =29, so 28 + H -1 =29, so H-1=1, H=2.\n\nThen the sequence: actions from t=0 to H-1=1, so t=0 and t=1? t from 0 to H-1.\n\nt=0: a_{t1 +0} = a_28\n\nt=1: a_{t1 +1} = a_29\n\nAnd y_{t1 + H -1} = y_{28 + 2 -1} = y_29 =9.\n\nYes.\n\nSo with one action: at turn 28, do U, then at turn 29, y=9.\n\nBut I need to specify actions for t=28 to t=28+H-1, with H=2, so a_28 and a_29.\n\nAt turn 29, I am at y=9, I can do S or something, but since I am already at 9, and no need to move, but I have to choose an action, but it doesn't matter, as long as I am at 9 at turn 29.\n\nThe minimal H should be 1, but with H=1, I can only be at turn 28, which is not 9.\n\nSo minimal H is 2: action at turn 28 to go to 9 at turn 29.\n\nH=2: actions a_28 and a_29, with y_29=9.\n\nBut a_29 can be S, since I am at 9.\n\nBut I need to reach at turn t1+H-1=29.\n\nIn this case, with a_28=U, I go to y_29=9.\n\nThen a_29 can be anything, S, U, D, but if U, y_30=9 or 10, but y=10 invalid, so probably stays 9, similarly.\n\nBut since we are at 9, it's fine.\n\nBut in terms of collision, when I am at y=9, no cars, so safe.\n\nBut in this action, at turn 28, when I do U, I am on y=8 at turn 28, which is safe, as we checked.\n\nThen at turn 29, I am on y=9, safe.\n\nSo with a_28=U, and say a_29=S, but a_29 is at turn 29, when I am at y=9, and I do S, stay at 9 for turn 30, but we don't care, since we reached at turn 29.\n\nThe sequence should be until I reach.\n\nBut in the sequence for t=0 to H-1, with H=2, a_28 and a_29.\n\na_28=U to go up, a_29 can be S, for example.\n\nBut is there a problem with cars?\n\nI am at y=8 at turn 28, safe.\n\nThen I move to y=9 at turn 29.\n\nBut is there any issue with the row below or above? No, because when I move, I am not on the row during the move, only at the turns.\n\nIn this case, it seems fine.\n\nBut why would I need more turns? Only if there is a car at position 0 on y=8 at some turn, but at turn 28 it's safe, and if I move immediately, I don't stay, so no problem.\n\nPerhaps for other freeways, but since I leave y=8 immediately, I don't care about future positions on y=8.\n\nThe only collision risk is when I am on a freeway row at that turn.\n\nSince I am on y=8 only at turn 28, and it's safe, then I go to y=9 at turn 29, safe.\n\nSo H=2 should work.\n\nBut let's confirm the car positions at turn 28 for y=8.\n\nWe have cars: [-53,-42], [-17,-6], [19,30], none contain 0, so yes.\n\nNow, but the player is at (0,8), so position x=0, y=8.\n\nCollision if for that y, at that turn, 0 in car span.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, but I need to make sure that for the action, when I choose U, at turn 28, I am on y=8, no issue.\n\nThen at turn 29, on y=9, no cars.\n\nSo it seems straightforward.\n\nBut why are there other freeways? I don't need to go through them, since I start at y=8 and go directly to y=9.\n\ny=9 is not a freeway, so no issue.\n\nBut is y=9 accessible? Yes, from y=8 with U.\n\ny=8 to y=9 with U.\n\nSimilarly, I could go down, but that would take longer, not minimal.\n\nSo minimal H should be 2.\n\nBut let's see the answer format.\n\nI need to output the actions.\n\nBut perhaps I missed something.\n\nAnother thing: the cars are moving, and for y=8, at turn 28 it's safe, but if I stay, it might not be safe later, but I don't stay, I leave immediately.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nPerhaps for other rows, but I don't visit them.\n\nIn this case, since I start at y=8 and go up, I only need to be on y=8 at turn 28.\n\nBut let's double-check the car on y=8.\n\nFreeway 8: cars at t=28: [-53,-42], [-17,-6], [19,30]\n\nAll away from 0.\n\nNow, the speeds are 6, so they are moving right.\n\nAt future turns, for example, at turn 29, the positions would be shifted by s*(29-28) =6*1=6 to the right.\n\nSo for y=8 at turn 29: first car: [-53+6, -42+6] = [-47,-36]\n\nSecond: [-17+6, -6+6] = [-11,0]\n\n[-11,0], and 0 is included? -11 to 0, so 0 is in the span.\n\n[ -11, 0 ], since it includes endpoints, I assume? The span is [τ, h], so for right-moving, it includes τ and h.\n\nIn this case, at turn 29, for second car, span [-17 +6, -6 +6] = [-11, 0]\n\nSo 0 is in the span, since it includes 0.\n\nIf I were on y=8 at turn 29, I would collide.\n\nBut in my plan, I am not on y=8 at turn 29; I am on y=9 at turn 29.\n\nAt turn 28, I am on y=8, and I do U, so at turn 29, I am on y=9.\n\nI am never on y=8 at turn 29, so no collision.\n\nSimilarly, for other turns.\n\nSo it should be fine.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's see if going up immediately is possible.\n\nPerhaps there is a car at position 0 on some other row, but I don't go there.\n\nAnother thing: when I move, I might be between rows, but the note says that during the move, I am not on the row until the next turn.\n\nSpecifically, at turn T, I am on y_T, and if I move to y_{T+1}, at turn T, I am still on y_T for collision, and at turn T+1, on y_{T+1}.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, with one action U at turn 28, I can be at y=9 at turn 29.\n\nSo H=2: actions a_28 and a_29.\n\na_28 = U to move up.\n\na_29: since I am at y=9, I can choose S, for example.\n\nThe sequence: Turn 28: U\n\nThen Turn 29: S (or anything, but S is fine)\n\nBut in the sequence, for t=0 to H-1, a_{t1} to a_{t1+H-1}\n\nWith H=2, a_28 and a_29.\n\nAnd y_{t1 + H -1} = y_{28+2-1} = y_29 =9.\n\nYes.\n\nBut is there a way with H=1? H=1 would mean actions from t=0 to 0, only a_28, and y_{t1 + H -1} = y_{28+1-1} = y_28 =8, which is not 9, so impossible. So H=2 is minimal.\n\nPerhaps I can reach earlier, but I start at turn 28, so I can only start from there.\n\nSo I think this is it.\n\nBut the problem has many cars listed, and for multiple freeways, but since I don't go through them, it doesn't matter.\n\nPerhaps for y=8, there is a car coming, but at turn 28 it's safe, and I leave.\n\nBut let's see the car that will be at 0 at turn 29: the second car on y=8, at turn 29, span [-11,0], so 0 is occupied, but since I am not there at turn 29, fine.\n\nNow, just to be complete, let's see the initial position.\n\nPlayer at (0,8) at turn 28.\n\nI do U at turn 28, go to (0,9) at turn 29.\n\nSafe.\n\nPerhaps I need to output the sequence.\n\nBut the answer should be minimal H, which is 2.\n\nBut let's see if for some reason I cannot go up immediately.\n\nFor example, if at turn 28, on y=8, there was a car at 0, but there isn't.\n\nOr if going up required avoiding something, but no.\n\nAnother thing: y=9 is the goal, and it's row 9, which is not a freeway, so always safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 is bottom, but not freeway? Freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 have no cars.\n\ny=0 might be the start or something, but here not relevant.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 8, there is a car that will be at 0 at turn 29, but I avoid it by leaving.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if I need to go through other rows, but I don't.\n\nThe player is at (0,8), and (0,9) is adjacent, so directly reachable.\n\nSo minimal H=2.\n\nNow, the sequence: Turn 28: U\n\nTurn 29: S (for example)\n\nBut in the answer format, I need to list the actions.\n\nBut let's write it.\n\nBut perhaps I can have a_29 not specified, but I have to include it since H=2.\n\nSince at turn 29 I am at 9, and I need to be at turn 29, so action at turn 29 is after, but it doesn't affect the position at turn 29.\n\nThe position at turn T is before action a_T.\n\nAt turn T, position y_T, then I do a_T, then go to y_{T+1}.\n\nSo at turn 29, y_29=9, which is what we want.\n\nThen I do a_29, which can be S, staying at 9 for turn 30, but we don't care.\n\nSo in the sequence, I need to include a_29.\n\nBut to minimize, I can choose S.\n\nPerhaps I can have H such that I reach earlier, but I start at turn 28, so I cannot reach before turn 29.\n\nEarliest at turn 29.\n\nSo H=2.\n\nNow, but let's check if for y=8 at turn 28, is there any car exactly at 0? No, as spans don't include 0.\n\nSpans: [-53,-42], -42 <0, [-17,-6], -6<0, [19,30]>0, so no.\n\nAnd for other freeways, not relevant.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n\nBut the problem has cars for all freeways 1 to 8, but I only care about where I am.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider if I have to move down or something, but no reason.\n\nAnother thought: maybe to avoid future collision, but since I leave immediately, no issue.\n\nPerhaps the goal is to reach (0,9), and I can be there for multiple turns, but minimal turns to first reach, I think.\n\nThe task is to reach at some turn, minimize H, which is the number of actions to reach by turn t1+H-1.\n\nIn this case, with H=2, I reach at turn 29.\n\nIf I do nothing at turn 28, S, then at turn 29, I am still at y=8, which might have collision, as we saw at turn 29, car at [-11,0], so if I am at y=8 at turn 29, I collide because 0 in span.\n\nThen I cannot stay; I must move.\n\nBut I can move up or down.\n\nIf I move down to y=7, then I have to come back, which takes more turns, not minimal.\n\nSo best to move up immediately.\n\nIf I move up, I avoid the collision on y=8 at turn 29.\n\nSo yes.\n\nTherefore, the minimal sequence is U at turn 28, then at turn 29 I am at 9, and I can do S at turn 29.\n\nSo actions: Turn 28: U, Turn 29: S\n\nIn the sequence, for t=0: a_{28} = U\n\nt=1: a_{29} = S\n\nH=2.\n\nNow, to write in the box.\n\nBut let's confirm the car positions once more.\n\nCurrent turn t1=28.\n\nPlayer at (0,8)\n\nFreeway 8 cars: \n\nCar1: head -42, tail -53, right, speed 6. Since right, span at t: [τ + s(t-28), h + s(t-28)] = [-53 + 6(t-28), -42 + 6(t-28)]\n\nSimilarly, car2: h=-6, τ=-17, so [ -17 + 6(t-28), -6 + 6(t-28) ]\n\nCar3: h=30, τ=19, [19 + 6(t-28), 30 + 6(t-28)]\n\nAt t=28: [ -53, -42], [ -17, -6], [19,30]\n\nAt t=29: [ -53+6, -42+6] = [-47,-36], [ -17+6, -6+6] = [-11,0], [19+6,30+6]=[25,36]\n\nSo at t=29, on y=8, position 0 is occupied by the second car, span [-11,0], includes 0.\n\nSo if on y=8 at t=29, collide.\n\nBut by moving up at t=28, I am not on y=8 at t=29.\n\nSimilarly, at t=28, on y=8, no issue.\n\nFor other freeways, say if I were to go down, but I don't.\n\nFor example, freeway 7: similar cars, but I don't go there.\n\nSo no need.\n\nTherefore, the minimal is to go up immediately.\n\nSo the sequence should be:\n\nTurn 28: U\n\nTurn 29: S\n\nBut in the action at turn 29, I could do U, but y=9, U would try to go to 10, but since y max 9, it probably stays, so effectively S.\n\nSimilarly, D to 8, but then I leave, not good.\n\nSo S is fine.\n\nTo be precise, since the position is reached at turn 29, action at 29 doesn't change it for that turn.\n\nSo I think it's ok.\n\nNow, for the answer format.\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 28: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 29: S }\n\nIn the sequence, it's for turns t1 to t1+H-1, which is 28 and 29.\n\nH=2.\n\nPerhaps I can have only one action, but as we saw, impossible to be at 9 at turn 28.\n\nSo yes.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 8) at turn 28. The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y = 1 to y = 8.\n\nAt turn 28, the player is on freeway y = 8. The cars on y = 8 at turn 28 are:\n- Car 1: span [-53, -42] (head = -42, tail = -53, direction = right, speed = 6)\n- Car 2: span [-17, -6] (head = -6, tail = -17, direction = right, speed = 6)\n- Car 3: span [19, 30] (head = 30, tail = 19, direction = right, speed = 6)\n\nPosition 0 is not in any of these spans, so no collision occurs at turn 28.\n\nTo reach y = 9, the player can move up (action U) at turn 28. This results in y_{29} = 8 + 1 = 9 at turn 29.\n\nAt turn 29, the player is on y = 9, which is not a freeway (freeways are y = 1 to 8), so there are no cars and no collision risk. The position (0, 9) is reached at turn 29.\n\nThe minimal number of turns H is 2, as y_{t_1 + H - 1} = y_{28 + 2 - 1} = y_{29} = 9.\n\nThe sequence of actions is:\n- At turn 28: action U to move to y = 9 at turn 29.\n- At turn 29: action S to stay at y = 9 (since the position is already reached, but an action must be specified; S is chosen as it maintains the position).\n\nNo other sequence can achieve the goal in fewer turns, as H = 1 would leave the player at y = 8 at turn 28, not y = 9.\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 28: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 29: S }",
