        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to get from (0,0) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The player moves vertically, and the cars move horizontally on their respective freeways. Collision happens only if at the turn when I'm on a freeway, the x=0 is within the span of a car on that freeway at that exact turn.\n\nThe game starts at turn t_1 = 0, and I'm at (0,0). But y=0 is not a freeway; the freeways are from y=1 to y=8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, I think. The goal is to reach (0,9), which is also not a freeway, so no cars there.\n\nThe collision condition is only when I'm on a freeway y=1 to 8 at turn T, and for that freeway, there's a car where 0 is in its span at that turn T.\n\nAlso, when I move to a new y, I'm not considered on that new y until the next turn. So if I move from y_t to y_{t+1} at turn t, at turn t I'm still on y_t, and at turn t+1 I'm on y_{t+1}.\n\nThe player update: at each turn, I choose an action: U (up, y increases by 1), D (down, y decreases by 1), or S (stay, y same). And y must stay between 0 and 9 inclusive.\n\nNow, the cars: for each freeway, there are cars with initial positions at turn t_1=0.\n\nI need to find a sequence of actions starting from turn 0 to minimize H, the number of turns to reach y=9.\n\nCurrent position: (0,0) at turn 0.\n\nGoal: reach (0,9) at some turn T, so y_T =9.\n\nI need to go from y=0 to y=9, so I need to increase y by 9. Each U action increases y by 1, S keeps it same, D decreases. To minimize turns, I probably want to use as many U actions as possible, but I have to avoid the freeways when there's a car at x=0.\n\nSince I start at y=0 and end at y=9, both safe, and I need to cross y=1 to y=8, but I can stay on some y for multiple turns to avoid cars.\n\nThe minimal number of turns without any cars would be 9 turns, all U actions, but with cars, I might need to wait or go down sometimes to avoid collisions.\n\nFirst, I need to model the car movements for each freeway at each turn.\n\nThe car spans are given at turn t_1=0, and they move with constant speed.\n\nFor left-moving cars, the span moves left, so head decreases, tail decreases.\n\nFor right-moving, head increases, tail increases.\n\nThe span is given as (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nDirection: left or right.\n\nIn the table, for freeway 1: (48, 37, right, 12) and (0, -11, right, 12)\n\nI need to find when x=0 is covered by a car on that freeway.\n\nx=0 is covered if for a car, min(head,tail) <= 0 <= max(head,tail), but since the span is a interval, it should be that 0 is between the tail and head.\n\nIn the description, for left-moving: span(t) = [h_t, τ_t] or something? Let's see.\n\nFor left-moving: \"Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\"\n\nIt says Span(t_1) = [h, τ], but for left-moving, if it's moving left, head should be on the right, I think? I need to interpret the coordinates.\n\nAssume that x increases to the right, so for a right-moving car, head is on the right, tail on left, so span is [tail, head] with tail < head.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, head on left, tail on right? But in the notation, it might be consistent.\n\nLook at freeway 1: cars (48, 37, right, 12) and (0, -11, right, 12)\n\nFor right-moving, direction right, so head should be greater than tail? 48 and 37, 48>37, so head=48, tail=37? But span from 37 to 48.\n\nThen (0, -11), 0 > -11, so head=0, tail=-11? But -11 to 0, which is from left to right.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, like freeway 3: (48, 71, left, 24), 48 and 71, 71>48, so if left-moving, head should be smaller? But it says (48,71,left,24), and 48<71, so perhaps head is the front when moving.\n\nTo avoid confusion, I should think of the span as an interval [min, max] that moves.\n\nThe key is that for a car, at time T, the position is shifted by speed times time difference.\n\nFor a right-moving car with speed s, at time T, the tail position is τ_0 + s*(T - t_1), head position is h_0 + s*(T - t_1)\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, tail is τ_0 - s*(T - t_1), head is h_0 - s*(T - t_1)\n\nIn the description:\n\nFor left-moving: Span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nBut h and τ are at t_1, so if at t_1, h is head, τ is tail.\n\nFor left-moving, if it moves left, head decreases, tail decreases.\n\nIn freeway 3: (48,71,left,24), at t_1=0, span [48,71]? But 48 to 71, if moving left, head should be 71? I think there's inconsistency in notation.\n\nPerhaps the head and tail are always such that for the direction, head is the leading part.\n\nTo simplify, I should compute the left and right endpoints.\n\nFor any car, define the position at time T.\n\nLet t=0 be t_1.\n\nFor a car with (head, tail, dir, speed) at t=0.\n\nIf dir = right, then at time T, the car occupies x such that min(head, tail) + s*T <= x <= max(head, tail) + s*T\n\nSimilarly for left, min(head, tail) - s*T <= x <= max(head, tail) - s*T\n\nBut min and max depend on which is larger.\n\nSince the span is given, we can find the left and right ends.\n\nFor a car, at t=0, the span is from low to high, where low = min(head,tail), high = max(head,tail), but head and tail might not be ordered.\n\nIn the data, for right-moving, like (48,37,right,12), 48 and 37, 48>37, so high=48, low=37.\n\nSimilarly, (0,-11,right,12), low=-11, high=0.\n\nFor left-moving, freeway 3: (48,71,left,24), 48 and 71, 48<71, so low=48, high=71, but moving left, so at time T, low = 48 - s*T, high = 71 - s*T.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nThen, for a freeway, at time T, there is a collision if for any car on that freeway, low(T) <= 0 <= high(T), i.e., 0 is between the low and high ends.\n\nNow, for each freeway k=1 to 8, I need to find when x=0 is occupied at time T.\n\nSince the cars move continuously, but we only care at integer turns, T integer.\n\nT is turn number, so integer.\n\nAlso, for the player, at turn T, I am at position y_T, and if y_T between 1 and 8, I need that for freeway k=y_T, no car has 0 in span at that T.\n\nIf I move to a new y at turn T, I am on the new y at turn T+1.\n\nAt turn T, after action, I am at y_{T+1}, but the position is for the turn.\n\nLet's clarify the timing.\n\nAt the start of turn t, I am at position (0, y_t).\n\nI choose action a_t, which determines y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nThen, after the action, at the end of turn t, I am at (0, y_{t+1}), and this position is for turn t+1? I think I need to see when the collision is checked.\n\nThe collision occurs at turn T if I am on freeway y_T at turn T, and for that freeway, 0 in span of some car at turn T.\n\nThe player position at turn T is y_T.\n\nWhen I perform action at turn T, I move to y_{T+1}, which is my position for turn T+1.\n\nFor collision at turn T, it is based on y_T and the car positions at turn T.\n\nIf I am at y_T at turn T, and y_T between 1 and 8, then check if for freeway y_T, there is a car with 0 in span at time T.\n\nNow, for the cars, at time T, the span is as computed.\n\nAlso, when I move, at turn T, after action, I go to y_{T+1}, but for collision at T, it's based on y_T, not y_{T+1}.\n\nThe note says: if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you are not on y_{T+1} at turn T, so no collision with cars on y_{T+1} at turn T.\n\nBut for y_T, if you are on it, you might have collision.\n\nIn this case, since you are on y_T at turn T, you check for freeway y_T at time T.\n\nIf you move away, at turn T, you are still on y_T for collision purpose.\n\nThen at turn T+1, you are on y_{T+1}.\n\nOkay.\n\nNow, back to the cars.\n\nLet me list for each freeway the cars and their span at time T.\n\nSince T starts from 0, and we care from T=0 onwards.\n\nBut at T=0, I am at y=0, which is not a freeway, so no collision. I need to start moving.\n\nLet me make a table for each freeway, when x=0 is occupied.\n\nThat is, for each k, find the set of T where for some car on k, 0 is in the span at T.\n\nThen, for the player, when on freeway y at turn T, it must be that T is not in the occupied times for that y.\n\nNow, y changes based on actions.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway the times when it is occupied at x=0.\n\nFreeway 1: y=1\n\nCars:\n\n1. (48,37,right,12) : at t=0, low=37, high=48, speed=12 right, so at time T, position low + 12T to high + 12T, so 37+12T to 48+12T.\n\n0 in span if 37+12T <= 0 <= 48+12T\n\nBut 37+12T <=0 and 0<=48+12T.\n\nSince 37+12T <=0 implies T <= -37/12 ≈ -3.08, so for T>=0, 37+12T >=37>0, so 0 <= 37+12T is false, so 0 not in [37+12T, 48+12T] for T>=0.\n\nSimilarly, 0 <=48+12T always true for T>=0, but low end 37+12T >0 for T>=0, so 0 not in interval.\n\nSecond car: (0,-11,right,12) at t=0, low=-11, high=0, speed=12 right, so at T, -11+12T to 0+12T = 12T to 12T? High=0, so position: low +12T = -11+12T to high +12T = 0 +12T = 12T.\n\nSo span [ -11+12T, 12T ]\n\n0 in span if -11+12T <= 0 <= 12T\n\nWhich is 12T -11 <=0 and 0<=12T\n\nFrom 0<=12T, T>=0\n\nFrom 12T -11 <=0, T <= 11/12 ≈ 0.916\n\nSo for T=0, -11 <=0<=0? 0<=0 is true, and -11<=0 true, so yes, 0 in [ -11, 0 ] at T=0.\n\nAt T=0, span [-11,0], so 0 is included, since it's the head or tail.\n\nIn the inequality, -11+12*0 = -11 <=0 <=0=12*0, yes.\n\nFor T=1, span [-11+12, 12] = [1,12], 0 not in [1,12]\n\nFor T>1, low increases, so 0 not covered.\n\nSo for freeway 1, occupied at T=0 only? At T=0, for this car.\n\nBut there is another car, but first one not occupied.\n\nSo only at T=0, occupied by second car.\n\nBut at T=0, I am not on freeway 1, I am at y=0.\n\nNow, for player, if I am on y=1 at turn T, I need T not such that occupied.\n\nHere, freeway 1 occupied only at T=0.\n\nT=0 is turn 0.\n\nNow freeway 2: y=2\n\nCars: (-48, -95, right, 48)\n\nAt t=0, head=-48? tail=-95? Since right-moving, and -48 > -95, so low = min = -95, high = max = -48.\n\nSpeed 48 right, so at T, position low + 48T to high + 48T = -95 + 48T to -48 + 48T\n\n0 in span if -95 +48T <= 0 <= -48 +48T\n\nWhich is:\n\n-95 +48T <=0 => 48T <=95 => T <= 95/48 ≈ 1.979\n\n0 <= -48 +48T => 48 <=48T => T >=1\n\nSo for T=1: -95+48= -47 <=0 <= -48+48=0? 0<=0 true, -47<=0 true, so yes.\n\nT=2: -95+96=1 <=0? 1<=0 false, and 0<= -48+96=48 true, but 1 <=0 false, so not.\n\nFor T=1, low=-95+48= -47? -95+48= -47, high=-48+48=0, so span [-47,0], so -47<=0<=0, yes 0 included.\n\nAt T=2, span [-95+96, -48+96] = [1,48], 0 not in.\n\nT=0: span [-95, -48], 0 not in, since -48<0? -48 to -95? min=-95, max=-48, so -95 to -48, all negative, 0 not in.\n\nSo only T=1 occupied for freeway 2.\n\nFreeway 3: y=3\n\nCars: (48,71,left,24)\n\nDirection left, at t=0 head=48, tail=71? 48 and 71, since left-moving, head should be smaller? But 48<71, so low=48, high=71.\n\nMoving left, speed 24, so at T, position: low -24T to high -24T = 48-24T to 71-24T\n\n0 in span if 48-24T <= 0 <= 71-24T\n\nWhich is:\n\n48-24T <=0 => 48<=24T => T>=2\n\n0 <= 71-24T => 24T <=71 => T <= 71/24 ≈ 2.958\n\nSo T=2: 48-48=0 <=0 <=71-48=23? 0<=0 true, 0<=23 true, so yes.\n\nT=3: 48-72=-24 <=0 <=71-72=-1? 0<=-1 false, and -24<=0 true, but 0<=-1 false, so not.\n\nT=1: 48-24=24 <=0? false, so not.\n\nSo only T=2 occupied for freeway 3.\n\nFreeway 4: y=4\n\nCars: three cars\n\nFirst: (-48, -59, right, 12)\n\n-48 and -59, right-moving, min=-59, max=-48 (since -59<-48)\n\nSpeed 12 right, at T, position: -59+12T to -48+12T\n\n0 in span if -59+12T <=0 <= -48+12T\n\nWhich:\n\n-59+12T <=0 => 12T <=59 => T <= 59/12 ≈4.916\n\n0 <= -48+12T => 12T >=48 => T>=4\n\nSo T=4: -59+48= -11 <=0 <= -48+48=0? 0<=0 true, -11<=0 true, yes.\n\nT=5: -59+60=1 <=0? false, not.\n\nSecond car: (-12, -23, right, 12)\n\n-12 and -23, min=-23, max=-12\n\nRight, speed 12, at T, -23+12T to -12+12T\n\n0 in span if -23+12T <=0 <= -12+12T\n\n-23+12T <=0 => 12T <=23 => T <= 23/12 ≈1.916\n\n0 <= -12+12T => 12T >=12 => T>=1\n\nSo T=1: -23+12= -11 <=0 <= -12+12=0? yes.\n\nT=2: -23+24=1 <=0? false.\n\nThird car: (24,13, right, 12)\n\n24 and 13, min=13, max=24? 13<24, so low=13, high=24\n\nRight, speed 12, at T, 13+12T to 24+12T\n\n0 in span if 13+12T <=0 <=24+12T\n\nBut 13+12T >=13>0 for T>=0, so never <=0, so 0 not in interval.\n\nNow, for freeway 4, occupied when any car has 0 in span.\n\nFrom first car: at T=4\n\nSecond car: at T=1\n\nThird car: never\n\nSo occupied at T=1 and T=4.\n\nFreeway 5: y=5\n\nCars: (48,37,right,4)\n\n48 and 37, min=37, max=48\n\nRight, speed 4, at T, 37+4T to 48+4T\n\n0 in span if 37+4T <=0 <=48+4T\n\n37+4T <=0 only if T large negative, impossible for T>=0, so never.\n\nFreeway 6: y=6\n\nCars: three\n\nFirst: (48,37,right,4) same as above, never occupied.\n\nSecond: (12,1,right,4) min=1, max=12? 1<12, low=1, high=12\n\nRight, speed 4, at T, 1+4T to 12+4T\n\n0 in span if 1+4T <=0 <=12+4T\n\n1+4T <=0 false for T>=0, so never.\n\nThird: (-24,-35,right,4) min=-35, max=-24\n\nRight, speed 4, at T, -35+4T to -24+4T\n\n0 in span if -35+4T <=0 <= -24+4T\n\n-35+4T <=0 => 4T <=35 => T <= 35/4 = 8.75\n\n0 <= -24+4T => 4T >=24 => T>=6\n\nSo T=6: -35+24= -11 <=0 <= -24+24=0? yes\n\nT=7: -35+28= -7 <=0 <= -24+28=4? 0<=4 true, -7<=0 true, yes\n\nT=8: -35+32= -3 <=0 <= -24+32=8? yes\n\nT=9: -35+36=1 <=0? false\n\nSo for T=6,7,8\n\nNow, freeway 6 occupied at T=6,7,8\n\nBut only if I am on y=6 at those turns.\n\nFreeway 7: y=7\n\nCars: (48,37,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12)\n\nFirst car: (48,37,right,12) as freeway 1, never occupied for T>=0.\n\nSecond car: (0,-11,right,12) same as freeway 1, at T=0 occupied, but for T>=1 not.\n\nAt T=0: span [-11,0], 0 in.\n\nT=1: [1,12], not.\n\nSo freeway 7 occupied only at T=0.\n\nFreeway 8: y=8\n\nCars: (48,37,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12) same as above, occupied only at T=0.\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway the occupied times at x=0:\n\ny=1: T=0\n\ny=2: T=1\n\ny=3: T=2\n\ny=4: T=1 and T=4\n\ny=5: never occupied (since no car or cars don't cover 0)\n\ny=6: T=6,7,8\n\ny=7: T=0\n\ny=8: T=0\n\ny=5 is always safe, no cars at x=0 ever.\n\ny=5 has one car (48,37,right,4), which spans from 37+4T to 48+4T, all positive for T>=0, so yes, never at 0.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=0 at turn 0 to y=9 at some turn.\n\ny=0 at turn 0.\n\nI perform actions starting from turn 0.\n\nAt turn 0, I am at y=0.\n\nI choose action a_0, which sets y_1.\n\nThen at turn 1, I am at y_1, and so on.\n\nI need to reach y=9 at some turn H, so y_H =9.\n\nH is the number of turns, including the starting point? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence is from t=0 to H-1, actions, and at turn H-1, after action, y_H =9.\n\nDefine turns.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t.\n\nAfter action a_t, y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy.\n\ny_{t+1} is position at turn t+1.\n\nThe sequence of actions for t from 0 to H-1, so after H actions, y_H =9.\n\nTurn t from 0 to H-1, actions a_t, then after a_{H-1}, y_H =9.\n\nAnd we start at turn 0, y_0=0.\n\nMinimal H, meaning minimal number of turns to reach y=9.\n\nSince we need to increase y by 9, minimal H is 9 if no obstacles, but with obstacles, it might be more.\n\nNow, the freeways y=1 to 8 have occupied times.\n\nI need to plan a path: sequence of y_t for t=0 to H, with y_0=0, y_H=9, and for each t, if y_t between 1 and 8, then t not in occupied times for that y_t.\n\ny_t is the position at turn t.\n\nFor example, at turn t, if y_t = k, 1<=k<=8, then t must not be occupied for k.\n\nIf y_t not in 1-8, no problem.\n\nNow, the actions control how y changes: each step, y can stay, up, or down by 1.\n\nStart y_0=0.\n\nI need to avoid being on a freeway when it is occupied.\n\nList the occupied times:\n\nFor y=1: occupied only at t=0. But at t=0, I am at y=0, not on y=1. So for y=1, if I am on it at t, t cannot be 0. But t=0 is past, so as long as I am not on y=1 at t=0, which I'm not, so for y=1, I can be on it at any t except possibly others, but only t=0 occupied, which is gone.\n\nFor y=1, occupied only at t=0, and since at t=0 I'm not on it, so for t>=1, if I am on y=1, it is safe, because not occupied except t=0.\n\nSimilarly, y=2: occupied only at t=1. So I must not be on y=2 at t=1.\n\ny=3: occupied only at t=2, so not on y=3 at t=2.\n\ny=4: occupied at t=1 and t=4, so not on y=4 at t=1 or t=4.\n\ny=5: never occupied, so always safe to be on y=5.\n\ny=6: occupied at t=6,7,8, so not on y=6 at t=6,7,8.\n\ny=7: occupied only at t=0, so safe for t>=1.\n\ny=8: occupied only at t=0, safe for t>=1.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=0 to y=9.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe always.\n\nTo minimize turns, I want to go up as fast as possible, but avoiding the forbidden (y,t) pairs.\n\nThe forbidden positions:\n\n- Cannot be on y=2 at t=1\n\n- Cannot be on y=3 at t=2\n\n- Cannot be on y=4 at t=1 or t=4\n\n- Cannot be on y=6 at t=6,7,8\n\n- For other y and times, safe.\n\ny=1,5,7,8 are safe except as above, but y=1 safe after t=0, etc.\n\nSince y=5 is always safe, I might stay there to avoid bad times.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nStart at t=0, y=0.\n\nAt turn 0, I choose action a_0, which sets y_1.\n\ny_1 can be 0 (S), 1 (U), or -1 but y min=0, so D not possible since y=0, so a_0 can be S or U.\n\nIf a_0=S, y_1=0\n\nIf a_0=U, y_1=1\n\nCannot D.\n\nThen at turn 1, y_1 position.\n\nNow, if y_1=1, then at turn 1, I am on y=1. But y=1 is safe at t=1, since only occupied at t=0. So ok.\n\nIf y_1=0, still at start.\n\nBut to go up, better to move.\n\nNow, at t=1, I cannot be on y=2 or y=4, because occupied.\n\nSpecifically, cannot be on y=2 at t=1, and cannot be on y=4 at t=1.\n\ny=4 occupied at t=1.\n\nNow, similarly, at t=2, cannot be on y=3.\n\nAt t=4, cannot be on y=4.\n\nAt t=6,7,8 cannot be on y=6.\n\nNow, since y=5 is always safe, I can use it as a safe haven.\n\nI want to reach y=9 in min turns.\n\nSuppose I go up directly, all U actions.\n\nStart t=0, y=0\n\na_0=U, then y_1=1 at turn 1\n\nAt turn 1, y=1, which is safe.\n\nThen a_1=U, y_2=2 at turn 2\n\nBut at turn 2, y=2, and y=2 is occupied only at t=1, not t=2, so should be safe? y=2 occupied at t=1, not t=2.\n\nAt t=2, if I am on y=2, is it occupied? From above, y=2 occupied only at t=1, so at t=2, not occupied, so safe.\n\nBut at t=1, I was on y=1, not y=2.\n\nNow, y_2=2 at turn 2, safe.\n\nThen a_2=U, y_3=3 at turn 3\n\nAt turn 3, y=3. y=3 occupied only at t=2, not t=3, so safe.\n\nThen a_3=U, y_4=4 at turn 4\n\nAt turn 4, y=4. But y=4 occupied at t=4, so collision! Cannot be on y=4 at t=4.\n\nProblem.\n\nAlso, at t=1, y=4 is occupied, but I'm not on it at t=1.\n\nBut at t=4, I am on y=4 when it is occupied.\n\nSo need to avoid that.\n\nThen a_4=U, y_5=5 at turn 5, safe since y=5 always safe.\n\na_5=U, y_6=6 at turn 6, but at t=6, y=6 is occupied, collision.\n\nSimilarly, if I continue.\n\nSo direct path has problems at t=4 and t=6,7,8.\n\nNeed to adjust.\n\nOne way is to delay or avoid during bad times.\n\nFor example, at t=4, cannot be on y=4.\n\nBut in the path, when I reach y=4.\n\nI need to reach y=4 before or after t=4.\n\nSimilarly for y=6, avoid at t=6,7,8.\n\nSince y=5 is safe, I can stay at y=5 for some turns.\n\nStart: t=0, y=0\n\na_0=U: to y=1 at turn 1\n\nt=1, y=1, safe\n\nNow, at t=1, I need to choose a_1.\n\nIf I go up to y=2, but at t=1, I cannot be on y=2, because occupied at t=1.\n\nIf a_1=U, y_2=2, but at turn 2, y=2, and t=2, which is not occupied for y=2, so it should be ok.\n\nAt turn t, the position is y_t.\n\nAt turn 1, y_1=1 (if I came from a_0=U)\n\nThen a_1 action sets y_2.\n\nIf a_1=U, y_2=2, so at turn 2, I am at y=2.\n\nNow, for y=2, occupied only at t=1, not t=2, so at t=2, y=2 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, at t=1, I am at y=1, which is safe.\n\nThe issue is at t=1, I cannot be on y=2 or y=4, but since I am at y=1, not on them.\n\nSo for a_1=U, y_2=2 at t=2, safe.\n\nThen at t=2, y=2, I can go to y=3 with a_2=U.\n\ny_3=3 at turn 3.\n\nAt turn 3, y=3, occupied only at t=2, not t=3, so safe.\n\nThen a_3=U, y_4=4 at turn 4.\n\nBut at t=4, y=4 is occupied, so cannot.\n\nSo need to not be at y=4 at t=4.\n\nOptions: either be at y=4 before t=4 or after, or not go there, but I need to cross.\n\nSince y=5 is safe, I can go to y=5 before t=4.\n\nFor example, at t=3, if I am at y=3, instead of going to y=4, I can go directly to y=5 if possible? But I can only change by ±1 or 0.\n\nFrom y=3, I can go to y=4 or y=2 or stay.\n\nBut to reach y=5, I need to go through y=4.\n\nSo I must visit y=4 at some point.\n\nI need to be on y=4 at a time when not occupied, i.e., not t=1 or t=4.\n\nOccupied at t=1 and t=4, so safe times for y=4 are t=0,2,3,5,6,... except t=1 and t=4.\n\nBut t=0, I am at y=0, not on y=4.\n\nSo possible to be on y=4 at t=2,3,5,etc.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBack to the path.\n\nFrom start: t=0 y=0\n\na_0=U: y_1=1 at t=1\n\nt=1 y=1, safe\n\nNow at t=1, I choose a_1.\n\nIf I go U to y=2 at t=2, as above, safe.\n\nBut then at t=2, y=2, I can go to y=3 at t=3 with a_2=U.\n\ny_3=3 at t=3, safe.\n\nNow at t=3, y=3, I need to go to y=4 or y=2 or stay.\n\nIf I go to y=4 at t=4, but t=4 is bad for y=4.\n\nSo I should not go to y=4 at t=4.\n\nI could stay at y=3 for one turn or go down, but that might delay.\n\nSince I need to avoid t=4 for y=4, I can be at y=4 earlier or later.\n\nAt t=3, I am at y=3.\n\nIf I go U to y=4 at t=4, bad.\n\nI could go S, stay at y=3 at t=4? But at turn t=4, if I stay, y_4=3, position at turn 4 is y=3.\n\ny=3 is safe at t=4? y=3 occupied only at t=2, not other times, so at t=4, y=3 is safe.\n\nThen I can stay at y=3 for one turn.\n\na_3=S, then y_4=3 at turn 4.\n\nThen at turn 4, y=3, safe.\n\nThen a_4=U, y_5=4 at turn 5.\n\nAt turn 5, y=4, now is it occupied? y=4 occupied at t=1 and t=4, not t=5, so safe.\n\nThen y_5=4 at t=5.\n\nThen a_5=U, y_6=5 at turn 6, safe since y=5 always.\n\nNow, at t=6, y=5, I need to go to y=6, but at t=6,7,8, y=6 is occupied, so I cannot be on y=6 at those times.\n\nSo I should avoid being on y=6 at t=6,7,8.\n\nI can be on y=6 before or after.\n\nFor example, at t=5, I am at y=4? Let's see the path so far.\n\nt=0: y=0\n\na_0=U: y_1=1 at t=1\n\nt=1: y=1, a_1=U: y_2=2 at t=2\n\nt=2: y=2, a_2=U: y_3=3 at t=3\n\nt=3: y=3, a_3=S: y_4=3 at t=4  (stayed)\n\nt=4: y=3, a_4=U: y_5=4 at t=5\n\nt=5: y=4, a_5=U: y_6=5 at t=6\n\nNow at t=6, y=5, I need to go to y=6,7,8,9.\n\nBut y=6 occupied at t=6,7,8.\n\nIf I go U to y=6 at t=7, but at turn 7, y=6, which is occupied.\n\nSimilarly, if I stay at y=5, y_6=5, then at t=6, y=5, safe.\n\nThen a_6 action.\n\nIf I go U to y=6 at t=7, but t=7 occupied for y=6.\n\nIf I stay, y_7=5 at t=7, still safe.\n\nBut I need to go up.\n\nSince y=6 is bad from t=6 to 8, I need to be on y=6 before t=6 or after t=8.\n\nBefore t=6, for example at t=5, I am at y=4, not y=6.\n\nAt t=4, I was at y=3, etc.\n\nI can reach y=6 earlier.\n\nIn the current path, at t=6, I am at y=5.\n\nI can go to y=6 at t=7, but occupied, or stay at y=5 until t=9 or something.\n\nBut that might take more turns.\n\nSince I need to reach y=9, and y=6 to y=9 is 3 steps, but with delays.\n\nAnother idea: go to y=5 quickly and stay there during bad times for y=6.\n\nBut y=5 is safe.\n\nIn the path above, I reached y=5 at t=6.\n\nt=6: y=5\n\nNow, if I stay at y=5 for a few turns.\n\na_6=S: then y_7=5 at t=7\n\na_7=S: y_8=5 at t=8\n\nThen at t=8, y=5, I can go U to y=6 at t=9.\n\nAt turn 9, y=6, now y=6 occupied at t=6,7,8, not at t=9? Earlier I have t=6,7,8 occupied for y=6.\n\nAt t=9, is it occupied?\n\nFor y=6, third car: (-24,-35,right,4), at T, span -35+4T to -24+4T\n\n0 in if -35+4T <=0 <= -24+4T\n\n-35+4T <=0 when T<=35/4=8.75, so T<=8\n\n0<= -24+4T when T>=6\n\nSo for T=6,7,8 only, T=9: -35+36=1>0, not <=0, and 0<= -24+36=12, but 1<=0 false, so not occupied. Similarly, other cars don't cover. So at t=9, y=6 is safe.\n\nThen at t=9, y=6, I can go up.\n\na_8=U? Let's list turns.\n\nAfter t=8: y=5\n\nAt turn t=8, position y=5.\n\na_8 action sets y_9.\n\nIf a_8=U, y_9=6 at turn 9.\n\nTurn 9, y=6, safe as above.\n\nThen a_9=U, y_10=7 at turn 10\n\ny=7, occupied only at t=0, not t=10, safe.\n\na_10=U, y_11=8 at turn 11\n\ny=8, occupied only at t=0, safe.\n\na_11=U, y_12=9 at turn 12.\n\nReach y=9 at turn 12.\n\nBut is this minimal? H=12 turns? From t=0 to t=11 actions, y_12=9, so 12 steps? Number of actions from t=0 to t=11 is 12 actions? Let's count.\n\nt from 0 to H-1 actions, y_H=9.\n\nHere, actions at t=0 to t=11, 12 actions, y_12=9.\n\nBut y_0=0, after 12 actions, y_12=9.\n\nMinimal possible is 9, but with obstacles, it might be more.\n\nPerhaps I can do better.\n\nIn the above, I stayed at y=3 for one turn to avoid y=4 at t=4, and stayed at y=5 for three turns to avoid y=6 during t=6-8.\n\nBut I might reduce the waiting.\n\nFor y=6, bad at t=6,7,8, so I need to be on y=6 before t=6 or after t=8.\n\nBefore t=6: at t=5, I was at y=4, if I could be at y=6 at t=5, but I can only move one step per turn, so at t=5, I can be at y=5 max if I go up fast.\n\nStart: t=0 y=0\n\na_0=U: y_1=1 t=1\n\na_1=U: y_2=2 t=2\n\na_2=U: y_3=3 t=3\n\nNow, instead of staying, I could go directly to y=4 at t=4, but t=4 bad, so not.\n\nAt t=3, y=3, I can go to y=4 at t=4, bad, or go to y=2, down, but that might not help.\n\nPerhaps I can reach y=4 earlier.\n\nAt t=2, I am at y=2.\n\nIf I go U to y=3 at t=3.\n\nBut at t=2, y=2, I could go U to y=3 or D to y=1 or S.\n\nBut going down delays.\n\nSo not better.\n\nFrom y=3 at t=3, if I go U to y=4 at t=4, bad, so I must delay.\n\nIn previous, I stayed at t=4 at y=3.\n\nBut y=3 is safe at t=4.\n\nThen to y=4 at t=5.\n\nNow for y=6, I need to be there not at t=6,7,8.\n\nIf I can be at y=6 before t=6.\n\nAt t=5, I am at y=4, so at t=5, y=4.\n\nTo be at y=6 at t=5, impossible, since only one step per turn.\n\nAt t=5, max y=5 if I go up from y=4.\n\nIn the sequence: at t=5, y=4 (if I go from y=4 at t=5)\n\nThen a_5=U: y_6=5 at t=6\n\nBut at t=6, y=5, not y=6.\n\nTo be at y=6 at t=5, I need to have been at y=5 at t=4 or something.\n\nt=4: in previous, I was at y=3 or y=4.\n\nSuppose I go faster to y=4.\n\nBut at t=1, I cannot be on y=4, occupied.\n\nAt t=0, y=0.\n\na_0=U: y_1=1 t=1\n\nAt t=1, y=1, cannot go to y=2 or y=4 directly, only to y=0,1,2.\n\nIf a_1=U, y_2=2 t=2\n\nThen at t=2, y=2, a_2=U, y_3=3 t=3\n\nAt t=3, y=3, a_3=U, y_4=4 t=4 but bad.\n\nIf at t=3, I do something else.\n\nBut I need to reach y=4 at safe time.\n\nSafe times for y=4: t=2,3,5,6,...\n\nt=2: can I be at y=4 at t=2?\n\nAt t=2, position y_2.\n\nFrom start, t=0 y=0, a_0=U: y_1=1 t=1, a_1=U: y_2=2 t=2, so at t=2, y=2, not 4.\n\nCannot reach y=4 at t=2.\n\nSimilarly, at t=3, y_3=3 if I go up, not 4.\n\nSo earliest I can be at y=4 is t=4, but bad, or later.\n\nAt t=3, I can be at y=3, then to y=4 at t=4 bad, or wait to t=5.\n\nSimilarly, for y=6.\n\nNow, back to y=6.\n\nIf I can be at y=6 at t=5, but impossible.\n\nt=5: max y=5, since from y=0 to y=5 in 5 steps: t=0 y=0, a0 U y1=1, a1 U y2=2, a2 U y3=3, a3 U y4=4, but at t=4 y=4 bad if I go, but I cannot be at y=4 at t=4 safely.\n\nIn the safe path, I am at y=4 at t=5.\n\nThen y=5 at t=6.\n\nThen I need to go to y=6.\n\nBut at t=6,7,8, cannot be on y=6.\n\nSo I have to be on y=6 after t=8, at t=9 or later.\n\nThus, I must stay at some y below until t=9 to go to y=6.\n\nSince y=5 is safe, I can stay at y=5 from t=6 to t=8, then go to y=6 at t=9.\n\nAs in the first path.\n\nTo minimize H, I should go up as fast as possible except when forced to wait.\n\nIn the path: I reached y=5 at t=6.\n\nThen stayed at y=5 for t=6,7,8? At t=6 y=5, if I stay, at t=7 y=5, t=8 y=5, then a8 U to y=6 at t=9.\n\nActions: from t=6 to t=8, if I stay, three S actions.\n\nBut at t=6, I am at y=5, I can go up later.\n\nBut I need to avoid being on y=6 during t=6-8.\n\nSo staying at y=5 is fine.\n\nNow, after t=9 y=6, then I can go up to y=7,8,9 quickly.\n\ny=7 and y=8 are safe except t=0, so for t>0 safe.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nt=0: y=0, a0=U\n\nt=1: y=1, a1=U\n\nt=2: y=2, a2=U\n\nt=3: y=3, a3=S  (stay to avoid y=4 at t=4)\n\nt=4: y=3, a4=U\n\nt=5: y=4, a5=U\n\nt=6: y=5, a6=S  (stay to avoid y=6)\n\nt=7: y=5, a7=S  (stay)\n\nt=8: y=5, a8=U  (to y=6 at t=9)\n\nt=9: y=6, a9=U  (to y=7 at t=10)\n\nt=10: y=7, a10=U  (to y=8 at t=11)\n\nt=11: y=8, a11=U  (to y=9 at t=12)\n\ny_12=9, so H=12, actions from t=0 to t=11.\n\nNumber of turns: 12 actions.\n\nBut I can reduce the waiting.\n\nAt t=6, y=5, I need to stay until t=8, but I can go to y=6 at t=9.\n\nBut is there a way to reach y=6 earlier? No, because before t=6, I cannot be at y=6.\n\nFor example, at t=5, I am at y=4 or y=5.\n\nIf I could be at y=5 earlier, then I could go to y=6 before t=6.\n\nIn the sequence, I reached y=5 at t=6.\n\nCan I reach y=5 earlier?\n\nStart: t=0 y=0, a0=U y1=1 t=1\n\na1=U y2=2 t=2\n\na2=U y3=3 t=3\n\nNow, instead of staying at t=3, if I go U at t=3 to y4=4 at t=4, but bad, not possible.\n\nSo I must delay at some point before y=4.\n\nAt t=3, I stayed at y=3.\n\nBut if I go down or something, worse.\n\nSo I think I cannot reach y=5 before t=6.\n\nt=0: y=0\n\nt=1: y=1 (after a0=U)\n\nt=2: y=2 (a1=U)\n\nt=3: y=3 (a2=U)\n\nNow at t=3, y=3, if I go U, y4=4 at t=4, collision.\n\nIf I go S, y4=3 at t=4, then a4=U y5=4 at t=5\n\nThen a5=U y6=5 at t=6\n\nSo y=5 at t=6, cannot earlier.\n\nThen from t=6 y=5, I need to go to y=6 after t=8, so at t=9 y=6.\n\nIf I stay at y=5 from t=6 to t=8, that's three turns: t=6,7,8 at y=5.\n\nBut at t=8, I am at y=5, then a8=U to y=6 at t=9.\n\nI could, after reaching y=5, go down to y=4 or something, but that might not help and could take more turns.\n\nSince y=5 is safe, staying is fine.\n\nBut to save turns, I need to reach y=9 faster.\n\nAnother idea: go to y=8 or y=7 during the bad times, but y=7 and y=8 are safe except t=0, so I can be on them.\n\nBut to reach them, I need to go through y=6.\n\nFor example, at t=6, if I am at y=5, I could go to y=6, but occupied, so I cannot.\n\nUnless I go at a different time.\n\nPerhaps I can go up to y=9 before t=6 or after t=8.\n\nBut to reach y=9, I need at least 9 steps, but with constraints.\n\nMinimal time: since I must avoid y=4 at t=4 and y=6 at t=6,7,8, I have delays.\n\nIn the path, I have one turn waiting at y=3 and three turns waiting at y=5.\n\nBut the waiting at y=3 is to avoid y=4 at t=4, and at y=5 to avoid y=6 during t=6-8.\n\nBut for y=6, I only need to avoid three turns, but since I have to be at y=5 until t=6, and cannot go to y=6 until t=9, I wait three turns.\n\nBut I could be at a different y.\n\nFor example, at t=6,7,8, I could be at y=7 or y=8, but to be on y=7 at t=6, I need to have been on y=6 at t=5 or something.\n\nt=6 position y_6.\n\nIf y_6=7, that means at t=5, I was at y=6 or y=7 or y=8, but from below.\n\nSuppose at t=5, I am at y=4 or y=5.\n\nIf at t=5, y=5, then a5=U, y6=6 at t=6, but occupied, bad.\n\nIf I go to y=7 at t=6, I need to be at y=6 at t=5 or y=7 at t=5, but at t=5, I can be at y=5 max, so y_5 <=5, then y_6 <=6, so cannot be at y=7 at t=6.\n\nSimilarly, cannot be above y=6 at t=6 if coming from below.\n\nSo at t=6, I must be at y<=5, and since y=6 occupied, I should be below, like y=5 or less.\n\nSimilarly for t=7,8.\n\nSo the only safe place near is y=5.\n\nThus staying at y=5 is optimal.\n\nNow, for the earlier part, avoiding y=4 at t=4.\n\nI could be on y=4 at a different time.\n\nFor example, at t=3, can I be at y=4?\n\nAt t=3, y_3: from start, max y_3=3, as above.\n\nAt t=2, y_2=2, so y_3=3 if up.\n\nCannot be at y=4 at t=3.\n\nSo must be at y=4 at t=5 or later.\n\nIn the path, I have y=4 at t=5.\n\nThen y=5 at t=6.\n\nNow, is there a way to reach y=5 earlier? No.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=5 directly or something, but no.\n\nAnother idea: since y=5 is safe, and I need to avoid y=4 at t=4, I could go to y=5 before t=4.\n\nBut at t=4, to be at y=5, I need y_4=5.\n\ny_4: at turn 4.\n\nFrom start: t=0 y=0\n\na0=U: y1=1 t=1\n\na1=U: y2=2 t=2\n\na2=U: y3=3 t=3\n\nThen a3=U: y4=4 t=4 but collision at y=4 t=4.\n\nCannot.\n\nIf I go faster, but at t=1, I am at y=1, cannot jump to y=3.\n\nSo impossible to reach y=4 before t=4 safely, and at t=4 it is bad, so must be after, like t=5.\n\nSimilarly for y=6.\n\nThus, the path I have seems necessary.\n\nBut let's confirm the number of turns.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nActions:\n\nt=0: a0=U (to y=1)\n\nt=1: a1=U (to y=2)\n\nt=2: a2=U (to y=3)\n\nt=3: a3=S (stay y=3)\n\nt=4: a4=U (to y=4)  // at t=5 y=4\n\nAfter a4, y5=4 at t=5? Let's list positions.\n\nAfter action at t, y_{t+1} set.\n\nt=0: action a0, sets y1\n\nAfter a0, position at turn 1 is y1.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo:\n\n- At turn 0: position y0=0\n\nAction a0: choose U, so y1 = y0 +1 =1\n\n- Turn 1: position y1=1\n\nAction a1: U, y2=2\n\n- Turn 2: position y2=2\n\nAction a2: U, y3=3\n\n- Turn 3: position y3=3\n\nAction a3: S, so y4 = y3 +0 =3\n\n- Turn 4: position y4=3\n\nAction a4: U, y5=4\n\n- Turn 5: position y5=4\n\nAction a5: U, y6=5\n\n- Turn 6: position y6=5\n\nAction a6: S, y7=5\n\n- Turn 7: position y7=5\n\nAction a7: S, y8=5\n\n- Turn 8: position y8=5\n\nAction a8: U, y9=6\n\n- Turn 9: position y9=6\n\nAction a9: U, y10=7\n\n- Turn 10: position y10=7\n\nAction a10: U, y11=8\n\n- Turn 11: position y11=8\n\nAction a11: U, y12=9\n\n- Turn 12: position y12=9, reached.\n\nNumber of actions: from t=0 to t=11, 12 actions, H=12 turns to reach turn 12.\n\nBut y12=9 at turn 12.\n\nMinimal H: since I have to wait, it might be ok.\n\nBut perhaps I can save one turn.\n\nNotice that for y=6, bad at t=6,7,8, but at t=5, I am at y=4 or y=5.\n\nIf at t=5, I am at y=5, and I could go to y=6 at t=6, but bad.\n\nBut if I am at y=5 at t=5, then at t=5, position y=5, safe.\n\nThen action a5: if I go U, y6=6 at t=6, bad.\n\nBut I cannot go to y=6 directly from y=5 at t=5? No, action at t=5 sets y6.\n\nIf I go U at t=5, y6=6 at t=6.\n\nOccupied.\n\nIf I stay, y6=5 at t=6.\n\nThen same as before.\n\nSuppose I go down to y=4 at some point, but that might not help.\n\nAnother thought: since y=5 is safe, and I need to be at high y, but I have to cross y=6.\n\nPerhaps I can reach y=9 without going to y=6 during bad times by taking a different path, but I have to go through all y from 0 to 9.\n\nUnless I skip, but I can only change by 1, so I must visit each integer y between.\n\nSo the path must include all y from 0 to 9 in order, but I can stay or move, so I don't have to visit all if I move down, but to reach y=9 from y=0, since I move ±1 or 0, the y values must change monotonically or with downs, but to minimize time, it's best to go up directly with waits.\n\nIn this case, with downs would take more turns, so not better.\n\nThus, the path above with 12 turns seems reasonable.\n\nBut let's see if I can reduce the wait at y=5.\n\nFor example, if I can be at y=6 at t=5, but impossible.\n\nAt t=8, I go to y=6 at t=9.\n\nBut t=9 is when I go.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=7 or higher during t=6-8.\n\nBut to be at y=7 at t=6, I need y_6=7.\n\ny_6=7 means at t=5, I was at y=6,7,8.\n\nBut at t=5, I can be at y=5 max, so y_5 <=5, so y_6 <=6, cannot be 7.\n\nSimilarly for t=7,8.\n\nSo impossible to be above y=6 during t=6-8 if coming from below.\n\nThus, must be below or at y=5.\n\nSo staying at y=5 is fine.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to list the actions.\n\nIn the sequence above, actions are:\n\nt=0: U\n\nt=1: U\n\nt=2: U\n\nt=3: S\n\nt=4: U\n\nt=5: U\n\nt=6: S\n\nt=7: S\n\nt=8: U\n\nt=9: U\n\nt=10: U\n\nt=11: U\n\nIn the action list, for turn t_1 + t, but t_1 is given as current turn, here t_1=0.\n\nIn the problem, current turn is t_1, but in this case t_1=0.\n\nAnswer format: for each turn, action.\n\nNow, H=12, but let's see if I can do with H=11 or less.\n\nSuppose I start with S at t=0, stay at y=0, but that delays, so worse.\n\nOr go down, not possible.\n\nAt the end, I go up from y=8 to y=9, but I can reach y=8 faster? But y=8 is safe, but I need to go through y=6,7.\n\nIn the path, I reach y=8 at t=11, then to y=9 at t=12.\n\nBut if I can reach y=8 earlier.\n\nFor example, if I don't wait at y=3, but I have to, because of y=4 at t=4.\n\nSuppose at t=3, instead of staying, I go down to y=2, but then at t=4, y=2 or something, but I need to go up later, takes more turns.\n\nFor example: t=0 y=0 a0=U y1=1\n\nt=1 y=1 a1=U y2=2\n\nt=2 y=2 a2=U y3=3\n\nt=3 y=3 a3=D y4=2? Then at t=4 y=2, safe? y=2 occupied only t=1, so safe.\n\nBut now I am at y=2 at t=4, then I need to go up to y=3,4,etc.\n\na4=U y5=3 at t=5\n\nt=5 y=3, a5=U y6=4 at t=6\n\nNow at t=6 y=4, safe since y=4 not occupied at t=6.\n\nThen a6=U y7=5 at t=7\n\nt=7 y=5, safe\n\nNow, y=6 occupied at t=6,7,8.\n\nAt t=7, I am at y=5, cannot go to y=6 at t=8 because occupied.\n\na7=U y8=6 at t=8, but t=8 occupied for y=6, bad.\n\na7=S y8=5 at t=8\n\nThen a8=U y9=6 at t=9, safe\n\nThen similar as before.\n\nBut now, from t=3 to t=4, I went down, then up, so I have extra moves.\n\nPath:\n\nt=0: y0=0 a0=U\n\nt=1: y1=1 a1=U\n\nt=2: y2=2 a2=U\n\nt=3: y3=3 a3=D  // down to y=2\n\nt=4: y4=2 a4=U  // to y=3\n\nt=5: y5=3 a5=U  // to y=4\n\nt=6: y6=4 a6=U  // to y=5\n\nt=7: y7=5 a7=S  // stay, since cannot go to y=6 yet\n\nt=8: y8=5 a8=U  // to y=6 at t=9\n\nt=9: y9=6 a9=U\n\nt=10: y10=7 a10=U\n\nt=11: y11=8 a11=U\n\nt=12: y12=9\n\nSame as before, 12 turns, but I used a down action, which wasted a turn, whereas in the first path I used stay, which is better than down.\n\nIn first path, at t=3 I stayed, here I went down and back up, so worse or same.\n\nIn first path with stay at t=3, I have fewer changes.\n\nBut both have 12 turns to reach y=9.\n\nIn the down path, I reached y=4 at t=6, later than in first path at t=5, so I lost time.\n\nIn first path, y=4 at t=5, here at t=6.\n\nSo worse.\n\nThus, the first path is better.\n\nPerhaps I can avoid waiting at y=3 by going to y=5 earlier, but impossible.\n\nAnother idea: since y=5 is safe, I could go directly to y=5 if possible, but I can only move one step, so must go through y=1,2,3,4.\n\nUnless I start from y=0, I go to y=1, etc.\n\nNo shortcut.\n\nThus, minimal H is 12.\n\nBut let's confirm if I can be on y=4 at t=3 or something, but no.\n\nPerhaps at t=1, I stay or something.\n\nt=0 y=0 a0=U y1=1\n\nt=1 y=1, if a1=S, y2=1 at t=2\n\nThen at t=2 y=1, a2=U y3=2 at t=3\n\nt=3 y=2, a3=U y4=3 at t=4\n\nt=4 y=3, a4=U y5=4 at t=5\n\nSame as before, y=4 at t=5.\n\nThen continue.\n\nBut I wasted a turn at t=1 staying, so reached y=5 later.\n\nFor example, at t=5 y=4, a5=U y6=5 at t=6, same as before.\n\nBut now I have an extra stay at t=1, so I reach later.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo the first path is optimal.\n\nThus, actions:\n\nTurn 0: U\n\nTurn 1: U\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: S\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: S\n\nTurn 7: S\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nIn the sequence, for turn t_1 + t, but t_1=0, so turns 0 to 11.\n\nIn the answer, it should be listed.\n\nThe sequence has H=12 actions? From t=0 to t=11, that's 12 actions.\n\nBut in the problem, the sequence is {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, and y_{t_1 + H} =9 or something.\n\nDefine.\n\nIn the task: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}_{t=0}^{H-1} which minimizes H such that y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9\" no.\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAnd \"y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9\"? Not specified.\n\nIn the game dynamics, after actions, the position updates.\n\nAt turn t_1, position (0, y_{t_1})\n\nAfter action a_{t_1}, y_{t_1 +1} = y_{t_1} + Δy\n\nThen at turn t_1 +1, position (0, y_{t_1 +1})\n\n...\n\nAfter sequence of H actions from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, the position at turn t_1 + H should be (0,9).\n\nIn the action sequence, {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, so t from 0 to H-1, actions at times t_1 +0 to t_1 + H-1.\n\nThen after a_{t_1 + H-1}, y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nAnd at turn t_1 + H, position is (0,9).\n\nIn this case, t_1=0, start y=0.\n\nAfter H actions, y_H =9.\n\nIn my sequence, after 12 actions, y_{12}=9.\n\nActions at t=0 to 11.\n\nt_1 + t for t=0 to 11, so H=12.\n\nNow, to write the answer.\n\nBut in the sequence, I have actions.\n\nIn the boxed, list for each turn.\n\nSince t_1=0, it's turn 0 to turn 11.\n\nBut in the format, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc.\n\nSo for turn 0: U\n\nTurn 1: U\n\n...\n\nUp to turn 11: U\n\nBut let's list all.\n\nPerhaps I can have a shorter path by not going to y=6 at all during bad times, but I have to cross.\n\nAnother thought: since y=5 is safe, and I can go from y=5 to y=6 after t=8, but what if I go to y=7 or y=8 directly from y=5? But I can't, only to y=6.\n\nSo no.\n\nThus, I think H=12 is minimal.\n\nBut let's confirm the car for y=6.\n\nFreeway 6 occupied at t=6,7,8.\n\nAt t=9, safe.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nPerhaps I can reach y=9 before t=6, but impossible, since min 9 turns, but with constraints, I have to wait.\n\nFor example, to be at y=9 at t=9, I need y_9=9.\n\ny_9=9 means at t=8, y=8 or9, but from below, y=8.\n\nAt t=8, y=8, but to be there, I need to come from y=7 at t=7, and so on.\n\nBut at t=6, I need to be on y=6, but occupied, so impossible to be at y=6 at t=6.\n\nThus, cannot reach y=9 before t=9 or something.\n\nEarliest possible: since y=6 cannot be at t=6,7,8, so the earliest I can be at y=6 is t=9.\n\nThen y=7 at t=10, y=8 at t=11, y=9 at t=12.\n\nSo must be at least t=12 to be at y=9.\n\nSimilarly, I also had to delay for y=4, but that was at lower y, so the bottleneck is y=6.\n\nThus, H=12 is minimal.\n\nNow for the actions.\n\nIn the sequence, from t=0 to t=11 actions.\n\nBut at t=3, I have S, and t=6 and t=7 S.\n\nIn the list:\n\nTurn 0: U\n\nTurn 1: U\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: S\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: S\n\nTurn 7: S\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nNow, to write in the boxed format.\n\nThe answer should be:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 0: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 1: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 2: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 3: & S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 4: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 5: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: & S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: & S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: & U \\end{array} }\n\nBut in the format, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc., and since t_1=0, it's fine.\n\nH=12.\n\nBut let's make sure about the car states.\n\nFor example, at turn 4, when I am at y=3, is there any issue? y=3 occupied only at t=2, not t=4, safe.\n\nAt turn 5, y=4, occupied at t=1 and t=4, not t=5, safe.\n\nAt turn 6, y=5, no cars, safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nAt turn 9, y=6, as computed, not occupied.\n\nSo all good.\n\nThus, the minimal H is 12.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 0\\) is 12.

        "thinking": "<think>We are given the current turn t1 = 3 and the player is at (0,3). The goal is to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nImportant: Collision occurs at turn T only if the player is on a freeway y (which is between 1 and 8) and at that turn T, the car on that freeway has a span that includes 0.\n\nNote: The player updates at the same time as the cars. The player's action at turn t (say at time t) determines the position at time t+1. However, for collision: at turn T, the player is at y_T (which is the position after the action at T-1) and that is the freeway we check. But note: we are given the state at t1=3. So the player is at y3 = 3.\n\nWe are to output a sequence of actions starting from turn t1=3 (so the first action is a3) until we reach y=9.\n\nThe car state for each freeway (from 1 to 8) is given. Each car is represented by (head, tail, direction, speed). Note the direction: \n- For left-moving: the car moves to the left (negative x direction). The span at time t1 is [h, τ] and then at time T, it becomes [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)].\n- For right-moving: the car moves to the right. The span at time t1 is [τ, h] (but note the representation in the table: (head, tail, direction, speed) and for right it says \"head\" first? Actually, the table says for right: (head, tail, direction, speed) and then the span is [τ, h] for right? But wait the update rule says for right: [τ, h] becomes [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]. However, in the table the representation for right is given as (head, tail) but then the span is [tail, head] for right? Actually, the update rule says for right: \"Span(t1)=[τ, h]\" meaning that at t1, the car occupies from τ to h (with τ < h) and then moves to the right. But in the table, the first number is head and second is tail. We have to be cautious.\n\nLooking at the update rule:\n- Left-moving: span at t1 is [h, τ] -> meaning from h to τ, and since h is the head and the car is moving left, the head is the front? So if the car is moving left, then the head is at the rightmost? Actually, the update rule says: for left-moving, the span at T is [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]. So if at t1 the car is from h to τ (with h > τ, because moving left) then the entire car moves left by s*(T-t1). Similarly, for right: the span at t1 is [τ, h] (so τ < h) and then becomes [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n\nBut in the table, for freeway 1: two cars: (-36, -47, right, 12) and (36, 25, right, 12). \nFor the first car: head=-36, tail=-47, direction=right. But for a right-moving car, the head should be the front and so the head should be greater than the tail? But here head=-36 and tail=-47, so -36 > -47, so the head is at -36 and tail at -47? Then the span at t1 should be [tail, head] = [-47, -36]? But the update rule says for right: [τ, h] -> [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]. So τ = -47, h = -36? Then at time T, the car is at [-47 + 12*(T-3), -36 + 12*(T-3)].\n\nSimilarly, the second car on freeway1: (36,25,right,12) -> τ=25, h=36? Then [25,36] becomes [25+12*(T-3), 36+12*(T-3)].\n\nBut wait, the representation in the table: the first number is head and the second is tail. For a right-moving car, the head is the front (so the larger x) and the tail is the rear (smaller x). So the span is [tail, head] = [min, max]. For left-moving, the head would be the front (which is the leftmost? Actually, if moving left, the front is at the left, so the head would be less than the tail? But the update rule says for left: [h, τ] and then [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]. So if h is the head and the car moves left, then h should be the leftmost? Actually, the update rule uses [h, τ] for left, meaning that the car occupies from h to τ? But if the car moves left, then the head (front) is at the left, so h would be less than τ? \n\nBut in the table, for freeway 3: (-24,-1,left,24). For left, the representation is (head, tail) = (-24,-1). Then the span at t1 is [h, τ] = [-24, -1]? But then the car would be from -24 to -1? And then moving left, so the entire car moves left: at time T, it becomes [-24 -24*(T-3), -1 -24*(T-3)].\n\nSo to summarize: \nFor a car (head, tail, direction, speed):\n- If direction is left: the car occupies the interval [min(head, tail), max(head, tail)]? But wait: the update rule says the span is [h, τ] for left. But in the example, head=-24, tail=-1, so [h,τ] = [-24,-1] -> but that is an interval of 23 units? And then moving left. But note: the update rule does not require that h and τ are in any particular order? Actually, the update rule uses [h, τ] regardless of which is bigger? But then the car would be from the smaller to the larger? \n\nBut the update rule for left: [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]. So if h < τ, then the car is from h to τ. If h > τ, then the car is from τ to h? But the problem does not specify. However, in the example, for left: they give (-24,-1,left,24) and -24 < -1, so the car is from -24 to -1. Similarly, for right: the representation (head, tail) and then the span is [τ, h]? But in the first car of freeway1: (-36,-47,right,12) -> head=-36, tail=-47. Then the span is [τ, h] = [-47, -36]? So the car is from -47 to -36.\n\nTherefore, we can interpret:\n- For a car (head, tail, direction, speed):\n  - If direction is left: the car occupies the interval [min(head, tail), max(head, tail)] at t1? Actually, the update rule uses [h, τ] and then subtracts s*(T-t1) from both. So the relative order of h and τ doesn't matter? Because the update is linear. But the collision condition: we need to check if 0 is in [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]? But if h>τ, then the interval [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)] would be backwards? \n\nThis is critical. The problem states the span as [head, tail] for left and [tail, head] for right? Actually, the update rule says for left: [h, τ] and for right: [τ, h]. But note that in mathematics, an interval [a,b] is from min(a,b) to max(a,b). However, the update rule does not specify that the interval is inclusive and ordered. But in the collision condition, we check if 0 is in the span. So we must interpret the span as the set of points between the two numbers (including both) regardless of order? Actually, no: the problem says \"the car span\" and then gives the update. It does not specify the order. But note: in the right-moving update, they write [τ, h] and then [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]. So if τ < h, then the car is from τ to h. If τ > h, then the car would be from τ to h but that would be backwards? \n\nLooking at the examples: \nFreeway1: first car: head=-36, tail=-47, direction=right. Then τ = tail = -47, h = head = -36. And -47 < -36, so the car is from -47 to -36. Then at T, it becomes [-47 + 12*(T-3), -36 + 12*(T-3)].\n\nSimilarly, the second car: head=36, tail=25 -> τ=25, h=36, so [25,36] -> [25+12*(T-3), 36+12*(T-3)].\n\nFor freeway3: head=-24, tail=-1, direction=left -> so the car is from h=-24 to τ=-1? But the update rule for left: [h, τ] becomes [h -24*(T-3), τ -24*(T-3)] -> so from -24 -24*(T-3) to -1 -24*(T-3). Since -24 < -1, the interval is from a lower number to a higher.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the span is always from the smaller value to the larger value? Actually, the update rule for left: [h, τ] and then subtracts the same value, so the order of h and τ does not change the set. Similarly for right. So we can represent the car at time t1 as an interval [L, R] where:\n  - For left: L = min(h, τ), R = max(h, τ)\n  - For right: L = min(τ, h), R = max(τ, h)   -> but note: for right, the update rule uses [τ, h] so we take L = min(τ, h), R = max(τ, h)\n\nBut wait, the update rule for right: [τ, h] becomes [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]. So if τ > h, then the interval would be [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)] which is backwards? That doesn't make sense. Therefore, we must assume that for a right-moving car, τ <= h? Similarly, for left, h and τ: does the problem assume h <= τ? \n\nLooking at the data: \n- All the cars in the table: \n  For right: \n    freeway1: (-36,-47,right,12): here head=-36, tail=-47 -> so if we take τ = tail = -47, h = head = -36 -> then τ < h -> so the interval is [-47, -36].\n    (36,25,right,12): head=36, tail=25 -> τ=25, h=36 -> [25,36]\n  For left:\n    freeway3: (-24,-1,left,24): head=-24, tail=-1 -> if we take h=-24, τ=-1 -> then h < τ -> so the interval is [-24, -1].\n\nSo it appears that the representation is such that the car spans are given with the head and tail in the order that the head is the front. For right, the front is at the larger x (so head > tail) and for left, the front is at the smaller x (so head < tail). Therefore, we can compute the interval at t1 as:\n  - Right: [min(head, tail), max(head, tail)]? Actually, for right: the tail is the rear (so the leftmost) and head is the front (rightmost). So the interval is [tail, head] -> which is [min(tail, head), max(tail, head)]? But in the example, tail=-47 and head=-36, so min is -47, max is -36 -> that matches.\n\n  Similarly, for left: the head is the front (leftmost) and tail is the rear (rightmost). So the interval is [head, tail] -> [min(head, tail), max(head, tail)]? But in the example, head=-24, tail=-1, so min=-24, max=-1 -> that matches.\n\nTherefore, we can define for every car:\n  L0 = min(head, tail)\n  R0 = max(head, tail)\n\nThen at time T (relative to t1, so let dt = T - t1 = T-3):\n  - For right: the car moves to the right by s*dt, so the interval becomes [L0 + s*dt, R0 + s*dt]\n  - For left: the car moves to the left by s*dt, so the interval becomes [L0 - s*dt, R0 - s*dt]\n\nNow, collision condition: at turn T, if the player is on freeway y (which is between 1 and 8) and if 0 is in the interval of any car on that freeway at time T.\n\nNote: the player at turn T is at position (0, y_T). The freeway we check is y_T. And we check all cars on that freeway at time T.\n\nThe player's movement:\n  At turn t (starting at t=3,4,...), the player chooses an action a_t in {U, D, S}. Then:\n      y_{t+1} = y_t + 1 (if U), y_t - 1 (if D), y_t (if S), but clamped to [0,9].\n\nWe start at t1=3 at y3=3. We want to reach y=9.\n\nWe are to find the minimal H (number of turns) and the sequence of actions from a3 to a_{3+H-1} such that at the end of H actions (i.e., at time 3+H) we are at y=9. Note: the turn index: \n  Turn 3: we are at y3=3. Then we choose a3 -> at turn 4, we are at y4 = y3 + Δy3.\n  So after H actions, we are at time 3+H and the position y_{3+H}. We require y_{3+H}=9.\n\nWe are to avoid collisions at every turn T (from t1=3 onward) when we are at freeway y_T (if y_T is between 1 and 8). At T=3: we are at y3=3. We must check freeway3 at time T=3? \n\nBut note: the car state is given at t1=3. So at T=3, we can check the cars on freeway3: \n  Freeway3: one car: (-24,-1,left,24). At T=3: [min(-24,-1), max(-24,-1)] = [-24,-1] and then for left: at T=3: [-24 -24*(0), -1 -24*(0)] = [-24,-1]. Is 0 in [-24,-1]? No, because -24<=0<=-1? 0 is not in that interval. So we are safe at T=3.\n\nHowever, the problem says: collision occurs at turn T only if 0 is in the span of any car on freeway y_T. So at T=3, we are on freeway3 and we check freeway3 at T=3 -> safe.\n\nBut note: the player is at (0,3) at T=3. Then we take an action a3 to move to T=4.\n\nWe need to simulate the movement and the car positions at each future turn.\n\nThe minimal H: the minimal number of actions to get from y=3 to y=9 is 6 (if we only move up: 3->4->5->6->7->8->9: 6 moves). But we might have to wait because of cars.\n\nSo we must check for each freeway we will be on at each turn whether there is a car that covers 0 at that turn.\n\nWe are going to simulate turns starting from T=3 (current) and then T=4,5,... until we reach y=9.\n\nWe'll try to go as fast as possible (always U) and if we get blocked, we might have to wait (S) or even go down (D) to avoid? But going down would take us away from 9, so that would increase H. So we should avoid going down unless necessary.\n\nBut note: we can only be on freeways 1-8. The goal is at freeway 9? Actually, the grid: y=0,1,...,9. And the goal is (0,9). And the cars are on freeways y=1,...,8. So when we are at y=0 or y=9, there are no cars. But note: we start at y=3 and we are going to y=9. We must pass through y=4,5,6,7,8. And we are safe at y=0 and y=9.\n\nBut note: the problem says: avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1,...,8. So when we are at y=0 or y=9, no collision check.\n\nWe are to find the minimal H. We will try H=6 (only up) and see if it works. If not, then we try H=7, etc.\n\nBut note: we might have to wait at some freeway. So let's simulate with H=6:\n\nTurn 3: y3=3 -> safe (as above, car on freeway3: [-24,-1] -> 0 not in [-24,-1] -> safe.\n\nThen we choose a3 = U -> then at turn 4: y4 = 3+1 = 4.\n\nAt turn 4: we are on freeway4. Check freeway4 at time T=4 (dt=1):\n  Freeway4 has three cars:\n    car1: (-12,-23,right,12) -> at t1=3: L0 = min(-12,-23) = -23, R0 = max(-12,-23) = -12 -> then at T=4: [ -23 + 12*1, -12 + 12*1 ] = [-11, 0]\n    car2: (24,13,right,12) -> L0 = min(24,13)=13, R0=24? Actually, wait: the representation is (head, tail). For car2: head=24, tail=13? Then for right: we defined L0 = min(tail, head) = min(13,24)=13, R0 = max(13,24)=24 -> at T=4: [13+12,24+12]=[25,36]\n    car3: (60,49,right,12) -> L0 = min(60,49)=49, R0=60 -> [49+12,60+12]=[61,72]\n\nAt T=4, freeway4: the first car: [-11,0] -> does 0 fall in [-11,0]? Yes, because -11<=0<=0. So collision.\n\nTherefore, if we go up at turn3, we get to freeway4 at turn4 and collide.\n\nSo we must avoid that. How? We can wait at freeway3 at turn4? Then we do S at turn3: then at turn4, we are still at y4=3. But we were at freeway3 at turn3 and then at turn4? Then at turn4 we are at freeway3 again. Check freeway3 at T=4 (dt=1): \n  Freeway3: (-24,-1,left,24) -> at T=4: [min(-24,-1) -24*1, max(-24,-1)-24*1] = [-24-24, -1-24] = [-48, -25]. 0 is not in [-48,-25] -> safe.\n\nThen at turn4, we can choose U to go to y5=4? But then at turn5: we are at freeway4 at T=5 (dt=2). Check freeway4 at T=5:\n  car1: [-23 + 12*2, -12+12*2] = [-23+24, -12+24] = [1,12] -> 0 not in [1,12] -> safe?\n  car2: [13+12*2,24+12*2] = [13+24,24+24]=[37,48] -> safe.\n  car3: [49+24,60+24]=[73,84] -> safe.\n\nSo at T=5, freeway4 is safe.\n\nBut we have to consider the entire path. We are at y3=3 at T=3 -> safe.\n  a3 = S -> then at T=4: y4=3 -> safe (as above).\n  a4 = U -> then at T=5: y5=4 -> safe (as above).\n\nThen we continue: \n  T=5: at y5=4 -> safe. Then we do a5=U -> then at T=6: y6=5.\n\nAt T=6: freeway5? Check freeway5 at T=6 (dt=3):\n  Freeway5: one car: (60,49,right,4) -> L0 = min(60,49)=49, R0=60 -> [49+4*3, 60+4*3] = [49+12,60+12]=[61,72] -> safe.\n\nThen a6=U -> T=7: y7=6.\n\nAt T=7: freeway6. Check freeway6 at T=7 (dt=4):\n  Freeway6 has three cars: \n    (60,49,right,4): [49+4*4,60+4*4]=[49+16,60+16]=[65,76] -> safe.\n    (24,13,right,4): [13+16,24+16]=[29,40] -> safe.\n    (-12,-23,right,4): [min(-12,-23)= -23, max(-12,-23)=-12] -> then [ -23+4*4, -12+4*4] = [-23+16, -12+16]=[-7,4] -> 0 is in [-7,4]? Yes, because -7<=0<=4 -> collision.\n\nSo if we go up at turn6 (T=7 at freeway6) we collide.\n\nTherefore, we cannot go up at turn6. What to do? We can wait at freeway5 at T=6: so at turn5 we are at y5=4, then at turn5 we do S -> then at T=6 we are still at y6=5? Actually, no: \n  Turn5: we are at y5=4 (at T=5). Then we choose a5: if we do S, then at T=6: y6=4 -> but we were at freeway4 at T=5, then at T=6 we are at freeway4? Then we avoid freeway6 at T=6? But we need to get to freeway5 eventually.\n\nAlternatively, we can wait at freeway5? But at T=6 we are at freeway5? Actually, we were at freeway4 at T=5. Then we do U at turn5: then at T=6 we are at freeway5. Then we must check freeway5 at T=6: which we did above and it was safe. Then at turn6 we want to do S to avoid freeway6 at T=7? But if we do S at turn6, then at T=7 we are still at freeway5? Then we can avoid freeway6 at T=7.\n\nBut then we have to go to freeway6 eventually.\n\nAlternatively, we can go up from freeway5 at a later time.\n\nSo let's try:\n\nPlan A:\n  Turn3: S (to avoid collision at freeway4 at T=4)\n  Turn4: U -> T=5: freeway4 (safe at T=5: as above)\n  Turn5: U -> T=6: freeway5 (safe at T=6: as above)\n  Then at turn6: we cannot go U because then at T=7: freeway6 is unsafe. So we do S at turn6: then at T=7: we are still at freeway5? \n      But note: at T=6 we were at freeway5, then we do S -> then at T=7: y7 = y6 (which is 5) -> so freeway5 at T=7? \n      Check freeway5 at T=7 (dt=4): \n          car: (60,49,right,4) -> [49+4*4,60+4*4]=[65,76] -> safe.\n\n  Then at turn7: we do U -> T=8: freeway6? \n      Check freeway6 at T=8 (dt=5):\n          car1: (60,49,right,4): [49+4*5,60+4*5]=[49+20,60+20]=[69,80] -> safe.\n          car2: (24,13,right,4): [13+20,24+20]=[33,44] -> safe.\n          car3: (-12,-23,right,4): [-23+20, -12+20] = [-3,8] -> 0 is in [-3,8]? Yes. So collision.\n\nSo we collide at T=8 on freeway6.\n\nAlternatively, at turn7 we do not go to freeway6? We can wait again? Then at turn7: S -> then at T=8: freeway5 again? \n  Check freeway5 at T=8 (dt=5): [49+20,60+20]=[69,80] -> safe.\n\nThen at turn8: U -> T=9: freeway6 at T=9 (dt=6):\n  car1: [49+24,60+24]=[73,84] -> safe.\n  car2: [13+24,24+24]=[37,48] -> safe.\n  car3: [-23+24, -12+24] = [1,12] -> safe (0 not in [1,12]).\n\nSo that works.\n\nThen we continue:\n  T=9: we are at y9=6 -> then we need to go to 9: so we need 3 more moves: U at turn9 -> T=10: freeway7; U at turn10 -> T=11: freeway8; U at turn11 -> T=12: freeway9.\n\nBut we have to check freeway7 and freeway8.\n\nFreeway7 at T=10 (dt=7):\n  Cars: \n      (-36,-47,right,12): L0=-47, R0=-36 -> at T=10: [-47+12*7, -36+12*7] = [-47+84, -36+84] = [37,48] -> safe.\n      (36,25,right,12): [25+84, 36+84]=[109,120] -> safe.\n\nFreeway8 at T=11 (dt=8):\n  Cars: same as freeway7? \n      (-36,-47,right,12): [-47+12*8, -36+12*8] = [-47+96, -36+96] = [49,60] -> safe.\n      (36,25,right,12): [25+96,36+96]=[121,132] -> safe.\n\nSo the entire plan:\n\n  Turn3: S\n  Turn4: U\n  Turn5: U\n  Turn6: S\n  Turn7: S\n  Turn8: U\n  Turn9: U\n  Turn10: U\n  Turn11: U\n\nBut wait: we started at T=3: y3=3.\n  T3: a3=S -> y4=3\n  T4: a4=U -> y5=4\n  T5: a5=U -> y6=5\n  T6: a6=S -> y7=5\n  T7: a7=S -> y8=5\n  T8: a8=U -> y9=6\n  T9: a9=U -> y10=7\n  T10: a10=U -> y11=8\n  T11: a11=U -> y12=9\n\nSo we reach at T=12 (which is 9 moves from turn3 to turn11? Actually, we have taken 9 actions: from a3 to a11 (9 actions) and H=9? But note: the minimal without waiting is 6. We used 9.\n\nBut is there a faster way?\n\nWhat if we avoid freeway4 at T=4 by going down? But going down would take us to y=2 at T=4. Then we are on freeway2? Check freeway2 at T=4 (dt=1):\n  Freeway2: (96,49,right,48) -> L0 = min(96,49)=49, R0=96 -> [49+48*1,96+48]=[97,144] -> safe.\n\nBut then we are at y=2. Then we have to go up from 2 to 9: which is 7 moves. And we have already used one move (down) so total 8 moves? But we have to avoid collisions in the entire path.\n\nAlternatively, we might go down at turn3 to y4=2, then at turn4 go up to y5=3, then at turn5 go up to y6=4, then ... but that would be 7 moves from 3 to 9: 6 moves? Actually from 3 to 9: 6 moves. But we went down then up: that is two moves to get back to 3? Then we are at 3 at T=5. Then we can try to go up at T=5 to 4 at T=6? Then we avoid the freeway4 at T=4? But we have to check:\n\nTurn3: D -> y4=2 (at T=4: freeway2 -> safe as above)\nTurn4: U -> y5=3 (at T=5: freeway3 -> check freeway3 at T=5: dt=2 -> car: [-24-24*2, -1-24*2] = [-24-48, -1-48] = [-72,-49] -> safe)\nTurn5: U -> y6=4 (at T=6: freeway4 -> check at T=6: dt=3)\n      Freeway4:\n        car1: (-12,-23,right,12) -> [-23+12*3, -12+12*3] = [-23+36, -12+36]=[13,24] -> safe\n        car2: [13+12*3,24+12*3]=[13+36,24+36]=[49,60] -> safe\n        car3: [49+12*3,60+12*3]=[49+36,60+36]=[85,96] -> safe\nTurn6: U -> y7=5 (at T=7: freeway5 -> check at T=7: dt=4)\n        car: (60,49,right,4) -> [49+4*4,60+4*4]=[49+16,60+16]=[65,76] -> safe\nTurn7: U -> y8=6 (at T=8: freeway6 -> check at T=8: dt=5)\n        car1: (60,49,right,4): [49+20,60+20]=[69,80] -> safe\n        car2: (24,13,right,4): [13+20,24+20]=[33,44] -> safe\n        car3: (-12,-23,right,4): [-23+20, -12+20]=[-3,8] -> 0 in [-3,8] -> collision.\n\nSo at T=8, freeway6 is unsafe.\n\nThen we have to wait at freeway5? So at turn7: we do S -> then at T=8: y8=5 (freeway5) -> safe? \n        freeway5 at T=8: [49+4*5,60+4*5]=[49+20,60+20]=[69,80] -> safe.\nThen turn8: U -> then at T=9: freeway6? Check at T=9: dt=6\n        car1: [49+24,60+24]=[73,84] -> safe\n        car2: [13+24,24+24]=[37,48] -> safe\n        car3: [-23+24,-12+24]=[1,12] -> safe\nThen turn9: U -> T=10: freeway7 -> safe? \n        freeway7 at T=10: dt=7 -> \n            car1: [-47+12*7, -36+12*7]=[-47+84,-36+84]=[37,48] -> safe\n            car2: [25+84,36+84]=[109,120] -> safe\n        then U at turn10: T=11: freeway8 -> \n            freeway8 at T=11: dt=8 -> \n                car1: [-47+12*8, -36+12*8]=[-47+96,-36+96]=[49,60] -> safe\n                car2: [25+96,36+96]=[121,132] -> safe\n        then U at turn11: T=12: freeway9 -> goal.\n\nSo this path: \n  Turn3: D\n  Turn4: U\n  Turn5: U\n  Turn6: U\n  Turn7: S\n  Turn8: U\n  Turn9: U\n  Turn10: U\n  Turn11: U\n\nTotal 9 moves? But we started at 3 and went down to 2 then up: so from 3 to 9: 6 moves? But we did 9 actions? Actually, we did 9 actions and ended at T=12 (from T=3 to T=12: 9 turns?).\n\nBut note: the goal is to minimize the number of turns H (the number of actions). The above two plans both have H=9.\n\nBut is there a plan with H=8? or 7?\n\nWe must get from 3 to 9: 6 moves upward. We cannot avoid at least 6 U moves. So minimal H is at least 6. But we saw that 6 is impossible. Then 7: we would have to do 6 U and 1 S? But 6 U and 1 S: that would take 7 moves. Can we do it?\n\nWe need to avoid the collisions at freeway4 and freeway6.\n\nThe collisions occur at:\n  freeway4: unsafe at T=4, but safe at T=5 and T=6? \n      T=4: unsafe (car1: [-11,0])\n      T=5: safe (car1: [1,12])\n      T=6: safe? [13,24] -> safe.\n\n  freeway6: unsafe at T=7 and T=8? \n      T=7: unsafe (car3: [-7,4] -> includes 0)\n      T=8: unsafe (car3: [-3,8] -> includes 0)\n      T=9: safe (car3: [1,12])\n\nSo we must be at freeway4 at a time not 4, and at freeway6 at a time not 7 or 8.\n\nWe are at freeway4 when we move from y=3 to y=4? Then we are at freeway4 at the next turn. Similarly, we are at freeway6 when we move from y=5 to y=6? Then at the next turn we are at freeway6.\n\nWe start at T=3 at y=3.\n\nWe can schedule:\n  We want to be at freeway4 at T=5 (safe) and freeway6 at T=9 (safe).\n\nHow? \n  T=3: at y=3 -> safe.\n  We can do:\n      T3: U -> then at T=4: y=4 -> but freeway4 at T=4 is unsafe -> not good.\n      T3: S -> then at T=4: y=3 -> safe.\n      Then T4: U -> then at T=5: y=4 -> freeway4 at T=5: safe.\n      Then T5: U -> then at T=6: y=5 -> freeway5 at T=6: safe (as above).\n      Then we want to be at freeway6 at T=9. But we are at y=5 at T=6. Then we have to wait until T=8 to move to freeway6? \n          Because if we move at T6: U -> then at T=7: y=6 -> freeway6 at T=7: unsafe.\n          If we wait at T6: S -> then at T=7: y=5 -> safe (freeway5 at T=7: [65,76] -> safe)\n          Then at T7: U -> then at T=8: y=6 -> freeway6 at T=8: unsafe (car3: [-3,8] -> unsafe).\n          Then we must wait again: T7: S -> then at T=8: y=5 -> safe.\n          Then at T8: U -> then at T=9: y=6 -> freeway6 at T=9: safe.\n\n      Then we need to go from 6 to 9: three moves: \n          T9: U -> T10: y=7 -> freeway7 at T10: safe? \n              freeway7 at T10: dt=7 -> [37,48] and [109,120] -> safe.\n          T10: U -> T11: y=8 -> freeway8 at T11: dt=8 -> [49,60] and [121,132] -> safe.\n          T11: U -> T12: y=9 -> goal.\n\n      So total actions: \n          T3: S\n          T4: U\n          T5: U\n          T6: S\n          T7: S\n          T8: U\n          T9: U\n          T10: U\n          T11: U -> 9 actions.\n\nAlternatively, after freeway5 at T=6, we could do two waits? But that doesn't help.\n\nBut note: we need to be at freeway6 at T=9. We are at freeway5 at T=6. We can do:\n  T6: wait (S) -> T7: freeway5 -> safe.\n  T7: wait (S) -> T8: freeway5 -> safe.\n  T8: U -> T9: freeway6 -> safe.\n\nThen we have to do three U moves for freeway7,8,9. That is 3 moves. So from T9: we do U at T9 -> T10:7; T10:U->T11:8; T11:U->T12:9. So total 9 moves.\n\nBut is there a way to save one move?\n\nWhat if we go up faster? We see that freeway4 is safe at T=5 and T=6. We were at freeway4 at T=5. Then we did U at T5 to get to freeway5 at T6. But what if we do two moves at freeway4? \n  At T5: we are at freeway4. Instead of going up, we wait? Then at T6: we are still at freeway4? Then at T6: we go up to freeway5 at T7. Then at T7: freeway5 is safe? \n      freeway5 at T7: [49+4*4,60+4*4]=[65,76] -> safe.\n  Then at T7: we go up to freeway6 at T8? But freeway6 at T8: unsafe (car3: [-3,8] -> unsafe).\n\nSo that doesn't help.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to be at freeway6 at T=9, but we can get to freeway6 earlier? But T=9 is the next safe time for freeway6 after T=6? Because at T=6: we are at freeway5, so we would be at freeway6 at T=7? which is unsafe. Then T=8: unsafe. Then T=9: safe. So we must avoid freeway6 at T=7 and T=8.\n\nTherefore, we cannot avoid two waits at freeway5.\n\nBut what if we do an extra move at the beginning? For example, we do two waits at freeway3? Then we go up at T5 to freeway4 at T6? Then freeway4 at T6: safe. Then we go up at T6 to freeway5 at T7: safe. Then we wait at freeway5 at T7 and T8? Then at T9: freeway6. Then we do three moves to 9: total moves: \n  T3: S\n  T4: S\n  T5: U\n  T6: U\n  T7: S\n  T8: S\n  T9: U\n  T10: U\n  T11: U -> 9 moves again.\n\nAlternatively, we might go down to y=2 at T4, then at T4 go up to y=3 at T5, then at T5 go up to y=4 at T6? Then freeway4 at T6: safe. Then we can go up at T6 to y=5 at T7: safe. Then we must avoid freeway6 at T7 and T8? So we wait at T7: S -> then at T8: y=5 -> then at T8: U -> T9: y=6 (freeway6 at T9: safe). Then three moves to 9: \n  T3: D\n  T4: U\n  T5: U\n  T6: U\n  T7: S\n  T8: U\n  T9: U\n  T10: U\n  T11: U? -> 9 moves.\n\nWe have to do 6 U moves and 3 non-U moves (S or D). So total 9 moves.\n\nBut note: we can avoid the first wait by going down? But going down and then up is two moves to get back to the same position? So that doesn't save.\n\nIs there a way to be at freeway6 at T=9 with only 6 U moves and 2 waits? That would be 8 moves.\n\nWe need to be at freeway6 at T=9. We start at T=3 at y=3. We have 6 moves to go: 3->4->5->6->7->8->9. But we have to avoid freeway4 at T=4 and freeway6 at T=7 and T=8.\n\nWe can try to slow down at the beginning and then speed up? \n\nSuppose we do:\n  T3: S (wait) -> T4: y=3\n  T4: S (wait) -> T5: y=3\n  T5: U -> T6: y=4 -> freeway4 at T6: safe (as above: [13,24] at T6? Actually, freeway4 at T6: dt=3 -> car1: [13,24] -> safe)\n  T6: U -> T7: y=5 -> freeway5 at T7: safe\n  T7: U -> T8: y=6 -> freeway6 at T8: unsafe -> not good.\n\nSo we cannot do that.\n\nAlternatively, we do:\n  T3: S -> T4: y=3\n  T4: U -> T5: y=4 -> freeway4 at T5: safe\n  T5: U -> T6: y=5 -> freeway5 at T6: safe\n  T6: S -> T7: y=5 -> freeway5 at T7: safe\n  T7: U -> T8: y=6 -> freeway6 at T8: unsafe.\n\nSo we still hit freeway6 at T8.\n\nBut if we wait two times at freeway5: \n  T6: S -> T7: y=5\n  T7: S -> T8: y=5\n  T8: U -> T9: y=6 -> freeway6 at T9: safe.\n\nThen we need to go to 9: three moves: \n  T9: U -> T10: y=7\n  T10: U -> T11: y=8\n  T11: U -> T12: y=9\n\nTotal: 9 moves.\n\nBut wait, we have 6 U moves and 3 S moves: 9 moves.\n\nWe cannot do less than 9? \n\nWhat if we do not wait at freeway3? We try to go down at T3 to y=2 at T4. Then we can do:\n  T3: D -> T4: y=2 (freeway2: safe)\n  T4: U -> T5: y=3 (freeway3: safe at T5: [-72,-49] -> safe)\n  T5: U -> T6: y=4 (freeway4: safe at T6: [13,24] -> safe)\n  T6: U -> T7: y=5 (freeway5: safe at T7: [65,76] -> safe)\n  T7: S -> T8: y=5 (freeway5: safe at T8: [69,80] -> safe)\n  T8: U -> T9: y=6 (freeway6: safe at T9: [1,12] -> safe)  [because car3: [1,12]]\n  T9: U -> T10: y=7 (freeway7: safe)\n  T10: U -> T11: y=8 (freeway8: safe)\n  T11: U -> T12: y=9\n\nStill 9 moves.\n\nBut note: at T8 we did U to go from y=5 to y=6 at T9. Then we have three moves to go from 6 to 9: that is three moves. But we are at T9 at y=6. Then we do U at T9 to y=7 at T10, U at T10 to y=8 at T11, U at T11 to y=9 at T12. So 9 moves.\n\nIs there a way to be at freeway6 at T=9 without waiting two extra times? \n\nWe have to cover 6 levels (from 3 to 9) in 6 moves upward. But we have to avoid two freeways at specific times. The minimal delay is 2 waits? So total moves = 6+2 = 8? But then we would be at y=9 at T=3+8-1=10? \n\nLet me count: \n  We do 6 U and 2 S: total 8 moves.\n  Then the position: \n      Start at y3=3.\n      Then 8 actions: \n          U, U, U, U, U, U, S, S -> but we would be at 3+6=9? Then the two S would do nothing? So we are at 9 at the sixth move? Then the last two S are done at y=9? \n          Actually: \n            T3: U -> y4=4\n            T4: U -> y5=5\n            T5: U -> y6=6\n            T6: U -> y7=7\n            T7: U -> y8=8\n            T8: U -> y9=9   -> then we are already at 9 at T9? Then we don't need the last two moves? But the problem requires that we output a sequence until the turn we reach 9. So we stop at the move that makes us reach 9.\n\nBut we cannot do 6 U in a row because we collide at freeway4 at T4 and freeway6 at T7 and T8? \n\nSpecifically, if we do 6 U in a row:\n  T3: U -> T4: y=4 -> collide at freeway4 (car1: [-11,0] at T4)\n\nSo we have to avoid that.\n\nWe need to insert waits in between. The two collisions happen at freeway4 and freeway6. We can insert one wait before freeway4 and one wait before freeway6? \n\nBut we have to insert a wait at freeway3 to avoid freeway4 at T4? Then we insert a wait at freeway5 to avoid freeway6 at T7 and T8? But we need two waits at freeway5? \n\nAlternatively, we insert one wait at freeway3 and one wait at freeway5? Then we do:\n\n  T3: S -> T4: y=3\n  T4: U -> T5: y=4 (freeway4 at T5: safe)\n  T5: U -> T6: y=5 (freeway5 at T6: safe)\n  T6: U -> T7: y=6 (freeway6 at T7: unsafe) -> so we collide.\n\nSo that doesn't work.\n\nWe need two waits: one for freeway4 and two for freeway6? But that would be three waits? \n\nBut note: we only have two problematic freeways. However, freeway6 is unsafe for two consecutive turns (T7 and T8). So we have to avoid both. How? By waiting two extra turns at freeway5.\n\nTherefore, we must have at least two waits. So total moves = 6 (U) + 2 (waits) = 8? But then we would be at 9 at the 8th move? \n\nLet me try:\n\n  T3: U -> T4: y=4 -> collide -> so we cannot do U at T3.\n\nWe must do a wait at T3: \n  T3: S -> T4: y=3\n  T4: U -> T5: y=4 -> safe\n  T5: U -> T6: y=5 -> safe\n  T6: S -> T7: y=5 -> safe\n  T7: S -> T8: y=5 -> safe\n  T8: U -> T9: y=6 -> safe\n  T9: U -> T10: y=7 -> safe\n  T10: U -> T11: y=8 -> safe\n  T11: U -> T12: y=9 -> goal.\n\nThat's 9 moves.\n\nBut wait, at T8: we do U to y=6 at T9. Then at T9: we are at y=6. Then we do U at T9 to y=7 at T10, etc. So we have 6 U and 3 S? \n\nAlternatively, can we combine a wait and a down move to save one move? Probably not.\n\nAnother idea: go up to freeway7 early? But we have to go through freeway4,5,6.\n\nOr use a down move to skip freeway6 at a safe time? For example, from freeway5, we go down to freeway4 at a time when freeway4 is safe, then up to freeway5 again? That would waste moves.\n\nTherefore, it seems that 9 is the minimal.\n\nBut let me check if there is a path with 8 moves.\n\nSuppose we do 6 U and 2 S. The 2 S must be inserted in the sequence. The sequence of moves must get us from 3 to 9 in 8 moves. The net movement is +6, so we must have 6 U and 2 non-U moves that are either S or D. But D would reduce the net, so we need more U to compensate. Therefore, the non-U moves must be S. So we have 6 U and 2 S.\n\nThe S moves can be done at any freeway. But we must avoid collisions.\n\nThe timeline:\n  T3: we start at y=3.\n  We have 8 actions: a3 to a10.\n\n  The position at each turn T (for T=3 to 11) must be safe.\n\n  We require that at T=11 (after a10) we are at y=9.\n\n  The moves: we need to have 6 U and 2 S.\n\n  The positions:\n      T3: 3\n      T4: 3 + d3   (d3: -1,0,1)\n      T5: T4 + d4\n      ...\n      T11: T10 + d10 = 9\n\n  We require sum_{t=3 to 10} d_t = 6.\n\n  And d_t is in {-1,0,1} but also we cannot go below 0 or above 9.\n\n  We have 8 moves, sum=6, so the number of U is 6, the number of D is 0, and the number of S is 2.\n\n  So the net is 6.\n\n  The sequence: the two S can be at any two of the 8 moves.\n\n  We must avoid:\n      freeway4 at T=4: unsafe.\n      freeway6 at T=7 and T=8: unsafe.\n\n  We will be at freeway4 when we move from 3 to 4: then the next turn we are at 4. \n  Similarly, freeway6 when we move from 5 to 6: then the next turn we are at 6.\n\n  We are at freeway y at turn T if the position at T is y.\n\n  We must schedule:\n      We cannot be at freeway4 at T=4.\n      We cannot be at freeway6 at T=7 or T=8.\n\n  How can we be at freeway4? \n      We are at freeway4 at turn T if the position at T is 4.\n\n  Similarly, freeway6 at turn T if the position at T is 6.\n\n  We start at T=3: y=3.\n\n  We want to be at freeway4 at a turn other than 4? We can be at T=5 or T=6, etc.\n\n  Similarly for freeway6: avoid T=7 and T=8.\n\n  We have to assign the two S moves to two of the 8 actions.\n\n  Let me try to put the first S at T3: then we are at y=3 at T4.\n  Then we can do U at T4: then at T5: y=4 -> freeway4 at T5: safe.\n  Then U at T5: T6: y=5.\n  Then we need to avoid freeway6 at T7 and T8. So we can put the second S at T6: then at T7: y=5.\n  Then U at T7: T8: y=6 -> freeway6 at T8: unsafe! -> not good.\n\n  Put the second S at T7: \n        T3: S -> T4:3\n        T4: U -> T5:4\n        T5: U -> T6:5\n        T6: U -> T7:6 -> freeway6 at T7: unsafe.\n\n  Put the first S at T4:\n        T3: U -> T4:4 -> freeway4 at T4: unsafe.\n\n  Put the first S at T5:\n        T3: U -> T4:4 -> unsafe.\n\n  Put the first S at T6:\n        T3: U -> T4:4 -> unsafe.\n\n  Put the first S at T3 and the second at T8:\n        T3: S -> T4:3\n        T4: U -> T5:4\n        T5: U -> T6:5\n        T6: U -> T7:6 -> unsafe at freeway6 at T7.\n\n  Put the first S at T4 and the second at T7:\n        T3: U -> T4:4 -> unsafe.\n\n  Put the first S at T4 and the second at T8:\n        T3: U -> T4:4 -> unsafe.\n\n  Put the first S at T5 and the second at T7:\n        T3: U -> T4:4 -> unsafe.\n\n  Put the first S at T5 and the second at T8:\n        T3: U -> T4:4 -> unsafe.\n\n  Put the first S at T6 and the second at T7:\n        T3: U -> T4:4 -> unsafe.\n\n  Therefore, there is no way to have only two waits and avoid the collisions.\n\nThus, minimal H is 9.\n\nWe can choose any of the 9-move paths. The first one we found:\n\n  Turn3: S\n  Turn4: U\n  Turn5: U\n  Turn6: S\n  Turn7: S\n  Turn8: U\n  Turn9: U\n  Turn10: U\n  Turn11: U\n\nBut let me verify the entire path:\n\n  T3: y=3 -> freeway3: at T3: [-24,-1] -> 0 not in -> safe. Action: S -> then T4: y=3.\n  T4: y=3 -> freeway3: at T4 (dt=1): [-24-24, -1-24] = [-48,-25] -> safe. Action: U -> then T5: y=4.\n  T5: y=4 -> freeway4: at T5 (dt=2): \n        car1: [-23+12*2, -12+12*2] = [-23+24, -12+24] = [1,12] -> safe.\n        car2: [13+24,24+24]=[37,48] -> safe.\n        car3: [49+24,60+24]=[73,84] -> safe.\n        Action: U -> then T6: y=5.\n  T6: y=5 -> freeway5: at T6 (dt=3): [49+4*3,60+4*3]=[49+12,60+12]=[61,72] -> safe. Action: S -> then T7: y=5.\n  T7: y=5 -> freeway5: at T7 (dt=4): [49+16,60+16]=[65,76] -> safe. Action: S -> then T8: y=5.\n  T8: y=5 -> freeway5: at T8 (dt=5): [49+20,60+20]=[69,80] -> safe. Action: U -> then T9: y=6.\n  T9: y=6 -> freeway6: at T9 (dt=6):\n        car1: [49+4*6,60+4*6]=[49+24,60+24]=[73,84] -> safe.\n        car2: [13+24,24+24]=[37,48] -> safe.\n        car3: [-23+24,-12+24]=[1,12] -> safe.\n        Action: U -> then T10: y=7.\n  T10: y=7 -> freeway7: at T10 (dt=7):\n        car1: [-47+12*7, -36+12*7]=[-47+84,-36+84]=[37,48] -> safe.\n        car2: [25+84,36+84]=[109,120] -> safe.\n        Action: U -> then T11: y=8.\n  T11: y=8 -> freeway8: at T11 (dt=8):\n        car1: [-47+12*8, -36+12*8]=[-47+96,-36+96]=[49,60] -> safe.\n        car2: [25+96,36+96]=[121,132] -> safe.\n        Action: U -> then T12: y=9 -> goal.\n\nSo it works.\n\nThe sequence of actions for turns 3 to 11 (9 actions) is:\n\n  Turn 3: S\n  Turn 4: U\n  Turn 5: U\n  Turn 6: S\n  Turn 7: S\n  Turn 8: U\n  Turn 9: U\n  Turn 10: U\n  Turn 11: U\n\nBut note: the problem asks for the sequence of actions starting from t_1 (which is 3) for t=0 to H-1. Here H=9, so t from 0 to 8? \n\nActually, the sequence is for t=0 to H-1: that is 9 actions: a3 to a11.\n\nSo we output:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 3: S\nTurn 4: U\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: S\nTurn 7: S\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\n}\n\nBut wait, the turn index: the first action is at turn3, then turn4, ... turn11. And after the action at turn11, we are at turn12: y12=9.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 9.\n\nWe'll output the above sequence.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns to reach position (0, 9) from (0, 3) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y = 1 to 8 is 9 turns. The sequence of actions is designed to avoid collisions at critical points:\n\n- **Freeway 4 (y=4)** is unsafe at turn 4 due to a car spanning [-11, 0]. Waiting at y=3 on turn 3 avoids this collision.\n- **Freeway 6 (y=6)** is unsafe at turns 7 and 8 due to a car spanning [-7, 4] and [-3, 8] respectively. Waiting at y=5 on turns 6 and 7 avoids these collisions.\n\nThe sequence ensures safe passage:\n- **Turn 3 (y=3)**: Safe (car at [-24, -1] does not cover 0). Action: Stay (S) to remain at y=3.\n- **Turn 4 (y=3)**: Safe (car at [-48, -25] does not cover 0). Action: Up (U) to move to y=4.\n- **Turn 5 (y=4)**: Safe (cars at [1, 12], [37, 48], [73, 84] do not cover 0). Action: Up (U) to move to y=5.\n- **Turn 6 (y=5)**: Safe (car at [61, 72] does not cover 0). Action: Stay (S) to remain at y=5.\n- **Turn 7 (y=5)**: Safe (car at [65, 76] does not cover 0). Action: Stay (S) to remain at y=5.\n- **Turn 8 (y=5)**: Safe (car at [69, 80] does not cover 0). Action: Up (U) to move to y=6.\n- **Turn 9 (y=6)**: Safe (cars at [73, 84], [37, 48], [1, 12] do not cover 0). Action: Up (U) to move to y=7.\n- **Turn 10 (y=7)**: Safe (cars at [37, 48], [109, 120] do not cover 0). Action: Up (U) to move to y=8.\n- **Turn 11 (y=8)**: Safe (cars at [49, 60], [121, 132] do not cover 0). Action: Up (U) to move to y=9.\n\nAfter turn 11, the player reaches (0, 9). The sequence minimizes turns by using waits only when necessary and moving up otherwise.\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn } 3: \\text{S} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 4: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 5: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 6: \\text{S} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 7: \\text{S} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 8: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 9: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 10: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 11: \\text{U}\n}",

The player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing the y-position by +1, -1, or 0, staying within 0 to 9.\n\nCars move left or right, and I collide only if I'm on a freeway y at turn T and 0 is in the car's span at that turn. Importantly, when I move to a new y, I'm not on that new y until the next turn, so I only check for collisions on the y I'm currently on at the start of the turn.\n\nThe current turn is t_1 = 5, and I'm at y=4.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the car positions at each turn relative to t=5.\n\nFor each car, given at turn 5, I can find where it is at any future turn T.\n\nThe span is given for turn t_1=5.\n\nFor left-moving cars, span at T is [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]? Let me read carefully.\n\nIt says:\n\nLeft-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nBut in the notation, for left-moving, h and τ, with h being head? Head and tail might imply direction.\n\nIn the car state, it's given as (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\n\nFor example, freeway 1: (-12, -23, right, 12)\n\nDirection right, so head should be the front when moving right.\n\nIn the update:\n\nRight-moving: Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nIt says for right-moving: \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h]\" and then Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nSimilarly for left: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nIn the input, it's given as (head, tail, dir, speed), but in the span definition, for right-moving, Span(t_1) = [τ, h], meaning from tail to head, I think.\n\nLet me clarify.\n\nFor a car moving right, at time t_1, the span is from tail to head, with tail at left, head at right, so positions from τ to h, with τ < h since moving right.\n\nThen at time T, it moves right, so positions increase: [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] where ΔT = T - t_1.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving: at t_1, span from head to tail? It says Span(t_1) = [h, τ], and since moving left, h is probably the left end at t_1? I'm confused.\n\nLet's read: \"Left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s (T-t_1), τ - s (T-t_1)]\"\n\nIf it's moving left, and at t_1, head h and tail τ, but in the span, it's [h, τ], which might be from h to τ, so if moving left, h could be the left end or right end?\n\nI think there's inconsistency in notation.\n\nPerhaps \"head\" is always the front, so for right-moving, head is right, tail is left; for left-moving, head is left, tail is right.\n\nIn the span for collision, it's a interval, and we care if 0 is in that interval.\n\nFor collision, we need to know for each freeway and each turn, if there is a car such that 0 is in its span at that turn.\n\nSince the player is at x=0, we care if x=0 is covered by a car on the same y at that turn.\n\nNow, for each car, given its state at t_1=5, I can compute for any T, the span.\n\nLet me define Δt = T - t_1 = T - 5.\n\nThen for a car:\n\nIf direction right: span at T is [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt]\n\nIf direction left: span at T is [h - s Δt, τ - s Δt]\n\nAnd in the input, (head, tail, dir, speed)\n\nFor example, freeway 1: cars: (-12, -23, right, 12) and (60, 49, right, 12)\n\nFirst car: head h=-12, tail τ=-23, dir right, speed 12.\n\nSince right, at t_1=5, span should be from tail to head? But tail τ=-23, head h=-12, so if moving right, tail at left, head at right, so positions from τ to h, which is from -23 to -12.\n\nThen at time T, span = [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] = [-23 + 12 Δt, -12 + 12 Δt]\n\nSimilarly, second car: (60, 49, right, 12), so tail=49, head=60? Head=60, tail=49, so tail at 49, head at 60, moving right, so span at t_1: from 49 to 60.\n\nAt T: [49 + 12 Δt, 60 + 12 Δt]\n\nNow freeway 2: (0, -47, right, 48)\n\nHead=0, tail=-47, dir right, speed 48.\n\nSpan at t_1: from tail to head, so [-47, 0]? But head is 0, tail -47, so positions from -47 to 0.\n\nAt T: [-47 + 48 Δt, 0 + 48 Δt] = [-47 + 48 Δt, 48 Δt]\n\nFreeway 3: (-72, -49, left, 24)\n\nDir left, head=-72, tail=-49.\n\nFor left-moving, Span(t_1) = [h, τ] = [-72, -49]?

Since y=9 is the goal, and no cars above, I just need to reach y=9.\n\ny=0 to y=9, with freeways 1 to 8.\n\nI start at y=4, so I need to move up to y=9.\n\nBut I have to avoid being on a freeway when a car covers x=0.\n\nAlso, I can move up, down, or stay, but since I want minimal turns, I should move up as much as possible, but I have to avoid the cars.\n\nThe minimal number of turns is at least 5, since from 4 to 9 is 5 steps up, but I might need to stay or go down to avoid collisions, so H could be more than 5.\n\nBut let's see if I can do it in 5 turns.\n\nAt each turn, when I am on a certain y, I need that at that turn, for that y, no car has 0 in its span.\n\nI start at turn t=5, y=4.\n\nFirst, I need to check for each freeway, at which turns 0 is covered, so I know when I cannot be on that row.\n\nSince the cars move continuously, I need to find for each freeway and each turn, if there is a collision risk.\n\nLet me define the turns: t=5,6,7,... up to when I reach y=9.\n\nΔt = T - 5.\n\nFor each freeway k, I need to find when 0 is in the span of some car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nThat is, for some car, min_span <= 0 <= max_span.\n\nSince span is [low, high], 0 is in if low <= 0 <= high.\n\nNow for each freeway, let's list the cars and find when 0 is covered.\n\nStart with freeway 1: y=1\n\nCars: \n\nCar A: [-23 +12 Δt, -12 +12 Δt]\n\n0 in span if -23 +12 Δt <= 0 <= -12 +12 Δt\n\nSo -23 +12 Δt <= 0 => 12 Δt <= 23 => Δt <= 23/12 ≈ 1.916, so Δt <= 1 since integer\n\nAnd 0 <= -12 +12 Δt => 12 Δt >= 12 => Δt >=1\n\nSo for Δt >=1 and Δt <=1, so Δt=1\n\nSimilarly, at Δt=1: low = -23+12= -11, high= -12+12=0, so 0 <= 0 <=0, yes covered.\n\n-11 <= 0 <=0, yes.\n\nFor Δt=0: low=-23, high=-12, both negative, 0 not <= -12? 0 <= -12 false, so not covered.\n\nΔt=2: low=-23+24=1, high=0+24=12, 1<=0<=12? 0<1, false.\n\nSo only at Δt=1, which is T=6, covered.\n\nCar B: [49 +12 Δt, 60 +12 Δt]\n\nlow=49+12Δt, high=60+12Δt, both positive for Δt>=0, so 0 not in, since low >=49>0.\n\nSo on freeway 1, only car A covers 0 at T=6 (Δt=1)\n\nNo other times.\n\nSo freeway 1 is safe except at T=6.\n\nT=6, y=1 has collision if on it.\n\nNow freeway 2: y=2\n\nOne car: (0, -47, right, 48)\n\nSpan at T: [-47 +48 Δt, 0 +48 Δt] = [-47 +48 Δt, 48 Δt]\n\n0 in span if -47 +48 Δt <= 0 <= 48 Δt\n\nFirst, 0 <= 48 Δt always true for Δt >=0 since 48Δt >=0.\n\nSecond, -47 +48 Δt <= 0 => 48 Δt <= 47 => Δt <= 47/48 <1, so Δt <=0 since integer.\n\nΔt <=0.\n\nBut Δt >=0, so only possible at Δt=0.\n\nAt Δt=0, low=-47, high=0, so -47 <=0<=0, yes covered.\n\nFor Δt=1, low=-47+48=1, high=48, 1<=0<=48 false.\n\nSo only at T=5 (Δt=0), covered.\n\nBut at T=5, we are at turn t_1=5, but the player is at y=4, not on y=2, so for freeway 2, collision only at T=5, but we are not on it, so for future turns, no collision on y=2.\n\nAt T>5, no car covers 0 on y=2.\n\nFreeway 3: y=3\n\nCar: (-72, -49, left, 24)\n\nDir left, so span at T: [h - s Δt, τ - s Δt] = [-72 -24 Δt, -49 -24 Δt]\n\nh=-72, τ=-49.\n\nSo low = -72 -24 Δt, high = -49 -24 Δt\n\n0 in span if -72 -24 Δt <= 0 <= -49 -24 Δt\n\nBut low and high are both decreasing, and for Δt>=0, low <= high <= -49 <0, so 0 <= high is false since high negative, so 0 never in span. Always safe.\n\n-49 -24Δt <= -49 <0, so high <0, so 0 > high, so 0 not <= high, so never covered. Safe.\n\nFreeway 4: y=4\n\nCars: (12,1,right,12), (48,37,right,12), (-36,-47,right,12)\n\nFirst car: span at T: [1 +12 Δt, 12 +12 Δt]\n\n0 in? low=1+12Δt >=1>0 for Δt>=0, so 0 < low, not covered.\n\nSecond car: [37+12Δt,48+12Δt] >=37>0, 0 not covered.\n\nThird car: [-47 +12 Δt, -36 +12 Δt]\n\n0 in if -47 +12 Δt <= 0 <= -36 +12 Δt\n\nFirst, 0 <= -36 +12 Δt => 12 Δt >=36 => Δt >=3\n\nSecond, -47 +12 Δt <=0 => 12 Δt <=47 => Δt <=47/12≈3.916, so Δt<=3\n\nSo Δt >=3 and Δt <=3, so Δt=3\n\nAt Δt=3, low= -47+36= -11, high= -36+36=0, so -11<=0<=0, covered.\n\nSo on freeway 4, only at T=8 (Δt=3) covered by third car.\n\nNow, at T=5, Δt=0, for freeway 4: first car [1,12], 0 not in; second [37,48] not; third [-47,-36], 0 not in since -36<0? -36 <=0 but 0 <= -36 false? 0 <= high? high=-36<0, so 0 > high, not <=, so 0 not in [-47,-36] because -36 <0. Similarly, at Δt=0, all low<0 or high<0 except first car low=1>0, so no coverage at T=5. Only at T=8.\n\nT=5: Δt=0, cars: [1,12], min=1>0; [37,48]>0; [-47,-36] both neg, so no car covers 0. Only at T=8.\n\nFreeway 5: y=5\n\nCar: (-44, -55, right, 4)\n\nSpan: [-55 +4 Δt, -44 +4 Δt]\n\n0 in if -55 +4 Δt <=0 <= -44 +4 Δt\n\nSo 0 <= -44 +4 Δt => 4 Δt >=44 => Δt >=11\n\nAnd -55 +4 Δt <=0 => 4 Δt <=55 => Δt <=55/4=13.75, so Δt<=13\n\nSo for Δt=11,12,13\n\nAt Δt=11: low=-55+44=-11, high=-44+44=0, covered\n\nΔt=12: low=-55+48=-7, high=-44+48=4, 0 in [-7,4], yes\n\nΔt=13: low=-55+52=-3, high=-44+52=8, 0 in, yes\n\nΔt=14: low=-55+56=1, high=12, 1<=0<=12 false\n\nSo covered at T=16,17,18 (since Δt=11,12,13; T=5+11=16, etc.)\n\nBut we are at t=5, and we want to finish quickly, so T=16 is far, but we might be on y=5 before that, so need to avoid at those times.\n\nFreeway 6: y=6\n\nCars: three\n\nFirst: (-44, -55, right, 4) same as freeway 5 car? Head=-44, tail=-55, right, s=4, so span [-55+4Δt, -44+4Δt]\n\n0 covered for Δt=11,12,13 as above.\n\nSecond car: (32,21,right,4) head=32, tail=21, span [21+4Δt,32+4Δt] >=21>0, no cover.\n\nThird car: (-4,-15,right,4) head=-4, tail=-15, span [-15+4Δt, -4+4Δt]\n\n0 in if -15+4Δt <=0 <= -4+4Δt\n\n0 <= -4+4Δt => 4Δt >=4 => Δt >=1\n\nAnd -15+4Δt <=0 => 4Δt <=15 => Δt <=15/4=3.75, so Δt<=3\n\nSo Δt=1,2,3\n\nAt Δt=1: low=-15+4=-11, high=-4+4=0, covered\n\nΔt=2: low=-15+8=-7, high=-4+8=4, covered\n\nΔt=3: low=-15+12=-3, high=-4+12=8, covered\n\nSo for freeway 6, covered at T=6,7,8 (Δt=1,2,3)\n\nBy third car.\n\nFirst car only at higher Δt.\n\nFreeway 7: y=7\n\nCars: same as freeway 1: (-12,-23,right,12) and (60,49,right,12)\n\nFirst car: [-23+12Δt, -12+12Δt], 0 covered only at Δt=1, T=6\n\nAs freeway 1.\n\nSecond car not cover.\n\nSo only at T=6 covered.\n\nFreeway 8: y=8\n\nSame as 7, only covered at T=6.\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway, the unsafe turns when collision if on that y.\n\ny=1: unsafe at T=6\n\ny=2: unsafe only at T=5, but T=5 is now, and we are not on it, so safe for T>5\n\ny=3: always safe\n\ny=4: unsafe at T=8\n\ny=5: unsafe at T=16,17,18 (but far, we may not be there)\n\ny=6: unsafe at T=6,7,8\n\ny=7: unsafe at T=6\n\ny=8: unsafe at T=6\n\ny=9: no freeway, or no cars, always safe.\n\nI need to go from y=4 at T=5 to y=9 asap.\n\nAt T=5, I am at y=4.\n\nNow, y=4 is safe at T=5, since no car covers 0, as we saw.\n\nI need to choose action: U, D, or S.\n\nSince I want to go up, U to y=5, or S at y=4, or D to y=3, but down might not help.\n\nMinimal turns, so I should go up when possible.\n\nBut I have to avoid unsafe times.\n\nLet me think about the path.\n\nI start at T=5, y=4.\n\nAfter action, at the end of turn, I move to new y, but for collision, at the start of turn, I am on y, and I check collision based on that.\n\nThe player update: at turn t, I am at position y_t.\n\nI choose action a_t, which determines y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nThen, at turn t, I am on y_t, and I collide if at turn t, for freeway y_t, 0 is covered.\n\nThen, after moving, at turn t+1, I am on y_{t+1}, and so on.\n\nSo for each turn, when I am on a certain y, it must be safe at that turn.\n\nNow, I want to reach y=9 at some turn H, meaning at turn H, y_H =9.\n\nSince at turn H, I am on y=9, which is safe, no problem.\n\nThe sequence: from t=5 to t=5+H-1 or something.\n\nLet t be the turn index.\n\nSet t=5 as current.\n\nI need to find actions for t=5,6,7,... until I reach y=9.\n\nAt t=5, y=4, safe as we saw.\n\nI can choose a_5: U, S, or D.\n\nIf U, y_6 =5\n\nIf S, y_6=4\n\nIf D, y_6=3\n\nThen at t=6, I am on y_6, and must be safe at t=6.\n\nNow, t=6 unsafe for which y?\n\nFrom above:\n\ny=1 unsafe at t=6\n\ny=6 unsafe at t=6\n\ny=7 unsafe at t=6\n\ny=8 unsafe at t=6\n\ny=4: at t=6, is it safe? y=4 unsafe only at t=8, so at t=6, y=4 is safe.\n\ny=3 always safe\n\ny=5: at t=6, Δt=1, for y=5, unsafe only at t=16,17,18, so at t=6, safe.\n\nSimilarly y=2 safe, etc.\n\nSo at t=6, unsafe y: 1,6,7,8\n\nSafe y: 2,3,4,5,9\n\nNow, back to t=5.\n\nIf I go U at t=5, to y=5 at t=6.\n\ny=5 at t=6 is safe, as above.\n\nThen at t=6, I am on y=5, safe.\n\nThen I can choose action for t=6.\n\nIf I stay S at t=5, y=4 at t=6, which is safe.\n\nIf down, to y=3, safe but lower.\n\nNow, similarly for later turns.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nSince y=9 is safe always, I can go directly if possible.\n\nBut there might be blocks.\n\nNow, let's see the unsafe times.\n\nFirst, t=6 is bad for many rows: y=1,6,7,8 unsafe.\n\nt=7: let's list unsafe times for each y.\n\ny=1: unsafe only t=6, so t=7 safe\n\ny=2: always safe for t>5\n\ny=3: always safe\n\ny=4: unsafe at t=8\n\ny=5: unsafe at t=16,17,18 (later)\n\ny=6: unsafe at t=6,7,8\n\ny=7: unsafe only t=6, so t=7 safe\n\ny=8: unsafe only t=6, so t=7 safe\n\nt=7 unsafe for which y?\n\ny=6 unsafe at t=7\n\ny=4 unsafe at t=8? t=7 is safe for y=4.\n\ny=4 unsafe only at t=8.\n\ny=6 unsafe at t=6,7,8\n\nSo at t=7:\n\nUnsafe y: 6 (since y=6 unsafe t=6,7,8)\n\ny=1 safe, y=2 safe, y=3 safe, y=4 safe (since unsafe only t=8), y=5 safe, y=7 safe (unsafe only t=6), y=8 safe (only t=6), y=9 safe.\n\nSo at t=7, only y=6 unsafe.\n\nt=8:\n\ny=1 safe\n\ny=2 safe\n\ny=3 safe\n\ny=4 unsafe (at t=8)\n\ny=5 safe\n\ny=6 unsafe (t=6,7,8)\n\ny=7 safe\n\ny=8 safe\n\nSo unsafe y: 4 and 6\n\nNow, I am at t=5, y=4.\n\nI need to get to y=9.\n\nOne way: go up directly.\n\nIf I go up at each step.\n\nt=5: at y=4, safe. Go U, to y=5 at t=6.\n\nt=6: at y=5, which is safe (since y=5 unsafe only later). Then I can go U to y=6? But at t=6, y=6 is unsafe! I cannot be on y=6 at t=6.\n\nIf I go U to y=6, then at t=6, I would be on y=6, which is unsafe, collision.\n\nBut when I choose action at t=6, if I go U, I move to y=6 at the end of turn, so at turn t=6, I am still on y=5 when I start the turn, and I choose action to move to y=6, which happens at t=7.\n\nImportant point.\n\nAt turn T, I am at position y_T.\n\nI choose action a_T, which sets y_{T+1}.\n\nDuring turn T, I am on y_T, and I check for collision on freeway y_T at time T.\n\nAfter the action, I move to y_{T+1} for the next turn.\n\nSo at turn T, I am always on y_T, and collision is checked based on y_T and time T.\n\nThen y_{T+1} is set based on action.\n\nFor example, at t=5, y=4, I am on y=4 at time 5, no collision.\n\nI choose a_5=U, so y_6=5.\n\nAt t=6, I am on y=5, check collision at time 6 for y=5. Since y=5 safe at t=6, no issue.\n\nThen I choose action for t=6.\n\nIf I choose U, then y_7=6.\n\nBut at t=6, I am on y=5, not on y=6 yet.\n\nWhen I am on y=6 is at turn t=7, if I move there.\n\nBack to sequence.\n\nAt t=5: y=4, safe. Suppose I go U, to y=5 at t=6.\n\nt=6: now at y=5, which is safe at t=6. I can choose action.\n\nI want to go to y=6. But at t=7, when I would be on y=6 if I go up now.\n\nAt t=6, I choose a_6.\n\nIf a_6=U, then y_7=6.\n\nThen at turn t=7, I will be on y=6.\n\nNow, at t=7, y=6 is unsafe, because from earlier, y=6 unsafe at t=7.\n\nIf I am on y=6 at t=7, collision.\n\nTherefore, I cannot go to y=6 at t=7.\n\nIf I go S at t=6, then y_7=5, stay on y=5.\n\nThen at t=7, on y=5, which is safe.\n\nBut y=5 is still low.\n\nIf I go D, to y=4, but then I go down.\n\nBut I need to go up.\n\nAt t=6, since I am at y=5, and I can go U, but then y_7=6, and at t=7, y=6 unsafe.\n\nI could go S to stay at y=5 for t=7.\n\nOr go D to y=4.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nSince y=6 is unsafe at t=7, I need to avoid being on y=6 at t=7.\n\nSimilarly, at t=8, y=6 is still unsafe, and also y=4 unsafe.\n\nNow, I need to reach y=9.\n\nMinimal turns: from y=5 to y=9 is 4 steps, but I might need to delay.\n\nSince y=3 is always safe, I could go down to avoid, but that might take more turns.\n\nNot efficient.\n\nAnother idea: at t=5, instead of going up, I stay or go down to avoid the bad times.\n\nBut let's list the safe paths.\n\nI need to be at y=9 at some turn.\n\nThe unsafe periods:\n\nFor y=6, unsafe at t=6,7,8\n\nt=6,7,8 y=6 unsafe.\n\nAlso y=4 unsafe at t=8.\n\ny=1 unsafe at t=6, but y=1 is low, not relevant.\n\ny=7 and 8 only unsafe at t=6.\n\nNow, I am at t=5, y=4.\n\nI can go to y=5 at t=6 by going U at t=5.\n\nThen at t=6, at y=5, safe.\n\nNow from here, I need to go to y=6, but y=6 is unsafe at t=7 and t=8.\n\nAt t=7, y=6 unsafe; t=8, y=6 unsafe.\n\nWhen is y=6 safe? Before t=6 or after t=8.\n\nt=6: unsafe, t=7 unsafe, t=8 unsafe, t=9: let's check.\n\ny=6: cars, at t=9, Δt=4.\n\nFor freeway 6, third car covers at Δt=1,2,3, so t=6,7,8.\n\nAt t=9, Δt=4, low=-15+16=1, high=-4+16=12, min=1>0, so 0 not covered, safe.\n\nSimilarly, first car at higher Δt.\n\nSo y=6 safe for t=9 and later.\n\nSimilarly, t=5: at t=5, Δt=0, for y=6, third car span [-15,-4], 0 not in, safe, but at t=5 I am not on y=6.\n\nAt t=5, I am at y=4.\n\nSo y=6 is safe at t=5, but I am not there; unsafe t=6,7,8; safe t=9 and after.\n\nSimilarly, y=4 unsafe only at t=8, safe other times.\n\ny=5 safe except t=16-18, which is far.\n\nNow, back to the point.\n\nAt t=6, I am at y=5 (if I went up at t=5).\n\nI need to go to y=6, but I cannot at t=7 or t=8 because unsafe.\n\nSo I have to stay at y=5 or go down until t=9.\n\nIf I stay at y=5 for a few turns.\n\nFor example, at t=6: at y=5, safe. I can choose S, so y_7=5.\n\nThen at t=7, on y=5, safe (since y=5 safe at t=7).\n\nThen at t=7, I can choose S again, y_8=5.\n\nAt t=8, on y=5, safe? y=5 unsafe only later, so safe at t=8.\n\nThen at t=8, I can go U to y_9=6.\n\nThen at t=9, on y=6, which is now safe.\n\nThen I can go up to y=7, etc.\n\nBut let's see the turns.\n\nFrom t=5: start y=4\n\na_5=U, to y=5 at t=6\n\nt=6: at y=5, a_6=S, to y=5 at t=7? If a_6=S, y_7=5\n\nThen t=7: at y=5, a_7=S, y_8=5\n\nt=8: at y=5, now I can go U, a_8=U, y_9=6\n\nt=9: at y=6, safe, go U, a_9=U, y_10=7\n\nt=10: at y=7, safe (y=7 unsafe only t=6, so safe), go U, a_10=U, y_11=8\n\nt=11: at y=8, safe (unsafe only t=6), go U, a_11=U, y_12=9\n\nThen at t=12, y=9, done.\n\nH=12-5+1? Turns from t=5 to t=11, that's 7 actions? Let's index.\n\nStart at turn t=5, position y=4.\n\nAfter H turns, at turn t=5+H-1, y=9? Better to think of the sequence.\n\nAfter action at turn t, I move to next position.\n\nAfter 0 actions, at t=5, y=4.\n\nAfter 1 action, at t=6, y depends on a_5.\n\nI reach y=9 at some turn T, after H actions, so at turn t=5+H, y=9? Let's see.\n\nAt turn t, after choosing action, I set y_{t+1}.\n\nSo at turn t=5, I start with y_5=4.\n\nI choose a_5, which sets y_6.\n\nThen at turn t=6, I have y_6, choose a_6, set y_7, and so on, until at some turn t=5+K, I have y_{5+K}=9.\n\nThe number of actions is K, from t=5 to t=5+K-1.\n\nThe turn when I reach y=9 is t=5+K.\n\nThe actions are from t=5 to t=5+K-1, K actions.\n\nH is the number of turns, I think, from the problem.\n\n\"minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\"\n\nt_1 + t for t from 0 to H-1, so actions at t_1, t_1+1, ..., t_1+H-1.\n\nAfter these H actions, I reach (0,9), I think.\n\nAfter action at t_1+H-1, the position is at turn t_1 + H.\n\nThe position after H actions is at turn t_1 + H.\n\nAnd we want y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t_1 to t_1+H-1.\n\nFor example, with H actions, I go from turn t_1 to turn t_1+H.\n\nAt turn t_1, before action, position is given.\n\nAfter action a_{t_1}, position at turn t_1+1, and so on, after a_{t_1+H-1}, position at turn t_1+H.\n\nWe want at turn t_1+H, y=9.\n\nIn the collision, at each turn t, we are at y_t, and we check collision based on t and y_t.\n\nIn the sequence above, with going up at t=5 to y=5 at t=6, then stay at y=5 for t=6 and t=7? Let's list turns.\n\nt=5: y=4, safe\n\na_5=U → y_6=5\n\nt=6: y=5, safe (as y=5 safe at t=6)\n\na_6=S → y_7=5\n\nt=7: y=5, safe\n\na_7=S → y_8=5? If a_7=S, y_8=5\n\nt=8: y=5, safe (y=5 not unsafe until t=16)\n\nBut at t=8, I can go U to y=6.\n\na_8=U → y_9=6\n\nt=9: y=6, safe (since y=6 safe at t=9)\n\na_9=U → y_10=7\n\nt=10: y=7, safe\n\na_10=U → y_11=8\n\nt=11: y=8, safe\n\na_11=U → y_12=9\n\nt=12: y=9, done.\n\nActions from t=5 to t=11, that's 7 actions: t=5,6,7,8,9,10,11.\n\nH=7 turns.\n\nBut I can do better.\n\nAt t=6, I am at y=5, instead of staying, I could go down to y=4 or something, but that might not help.\n\nSince y=3 is always safe, I could go to y=3 to avoid, but going down then up takes more steps.\n\nAnother idea: at t=5, I don't go up, I stay at y=4 for t=6.\n\nt=5: y=4, a_5=S → y_6=4\n\nt=6: now at y=4, is it safe? y=4 unsafe only at t=8, so at t=6, safe.\n\nThen at t=6, I can go U to y=5? a_6=U → y_7=5\n\nt=7: at y=5, safe\n\nThen at t=7, I can go U to y=6? But at t=8, I would be on y=6 if I go now.\n\nt=7: choose a_7.\n\nIf a_7=U → y_8=6\n\nBut at t=8, y=6 is unsafe, and also y=4 is unsafe, but I would be on y=6.\n\nSo collision at t=8 on y=6.\n\nIf at t=7 I go S, y_8=5\n\nThen t=8: at y=5, safe\n\nThen a_8=U → y_9=6, same as before.\n\nThen to y=9 at t=12 again.\n\nNot better.\n\nAt t=5, I go down to y=3.\n\nt=5: a_5=D → y_6=3\n\nt=6: at y=3, safe\n\nThen I can go up from there.\n\nBut y=3 to y=9 is 6 steps, plus the down, so at least 7 actions, worse.\n\nSo not better.\n\nBut I need to reach faster.\n\nPerhaps I can be on y=6 at t=9 directly, but from y=5 at t=6, if I go up at t=6 to y=6 at t=7, but t=7 y=6 unsafe.\n\nI have to wait until t=9 to be on y=6.\n\nBut from y=4 to y=5 at t=6, then I stay at y=5 for t=7 and t=8, then to y=6 at t=9.\n\nThe stay at y=5 for two turns: t=7 and t=8 I am at y=5.\n\nt=6 I am at y=5, t=7 at y=5, t=8 at y=5, then t=9 at y=6.\n\nBut I can go to y=7 earlier.\n\ny=7 is safe except at t=6.\n\nAt t=7, y=7 is safe.\n\nSimilarly y=8 safe except t=6.\n\nSo if I can be on y=7 at t=7, for example.\n\nBut to be on y=7 at t=7, I need at t=6 to be on y=6 or y=7 or y=8 and go down or stay, but y=6,7,8 all unsafe at t=6 except if I stay, but y=7 at t=6 unsafe.\n\nAt t=6, the only safe y to be on are 2,3,4,5.\n\ny=1 unsafe, y=6 unsafe, y=7 unsafe, y=8 unsafe, so only y=2,3,4,5 safe at t=6.\n\nI am at y=5 at t=6, which is safe.\n\nIf I want to be on y=7 at t=7, I need to be at y=6 or y=7 or y=8 at t=6 and go down or stay or up, but since at t=6 I am on y=5, I can go U to y=6, but then at t=7 I would be on y=6, which is unsafe at t=7.\n\nI could go to y=4 at t=6, then to y=5 at t=7, etc, slower.\n\nSo I cannot be on high y at early turns because of the unsafe times.\n\nAnother possibility: at t=5, I go to y=5 at t=6, then at t=6, instead of staying, I go down to y=4.\n\nt=5: a_5=U → y_6=5\n\nt=6: at y=5, a_6=D → y_7=4\n\nt=7: at y=4, now y=4 at t=7, is it safe? y=4 unsafe only at t=8, so at t=7, safe.\n\nThen at t=7, I can go U to y=5, a_7=U → y_8=5\n\nt=8: at y=5, safe, but at t=8, y=4 is unsafe, but I am on y=5, safe.\n\nThen a_8=U → y_9=6\n\nSame as before, then to y=9 at t=12.\n\nNo gain.\n\nPerhaps I can reach y=9 in fewer than 7 turns.\n\nMinimal is 5, but impossible because to go from 4 to 9 in 5 steps, I need to go up each turn, but let's see if possible.\n\nSuppose I go U every turn from t=5 to t=9.\n\nt=5: y=4, a_5=U → y_6=5\n\nt=6: y=5, a_6=U → y_7=6\n\nBut at t=7, y=7=6, and y=6 unsafe at t=7, collision. Not possible.\n\nIf at t=6 I go S, then y_7=5, then t=7: y=5, a_7=U → y_8=6, but at t=8, y=6 unsafe, collision.\n\nSo I must avoid being on y=6 at t=7 or t=8.\n\nSimilarly, cannot be on y=6 before t=9.\n\nSo the earliest I can be on y=6 is t=9.\n\nFrom y=4 at t=5, to y=5 at t=6, then stay at y=5 for t=7 and t=8, then to y=6 at t=9.\n\nThen from y=6 to y=9, 3 steps: to y=7 at t=10, y=8 at t=11, y=9 at t=12.\n\nt=9: y=6, a_9=U → y_10=7\n\nt=10: y=7, a_10=U → y_11=8\n\nt=11: y=8, a_11=U → y_12=9\n\nSo y=9 at t=12.\n\nActions from t=5 to t=11, H=7 actions.\n\nBut at t=8, I am at y=5, and I go U to y=6 at t=9.\n\nCan I go to y=7 earlier?\n\nFor example, if I can be on y=7 at t=7.\n\nTo be on y=7 at t=7, I need at t=6 to be on y=6 or y=7 or y=8 and move appropriately.\n\nBut at t=6, if I am on y=6, unsafe; y=7 unsafe; y=8 unsafe. So I cannot be on y=6,7,8 at t=6.\n\nThe only possibilities at t=6 are y=2,3,4,5.\n\nFrom there, to reach y=7 at t=7, I need to go up from y=6, but I cannot be on y=6 at t=6.\n\nIf at t=6 I am on y=5, I can go U to y=6, but then at t=7 I am on y=6, not y=7.\n\nTo be on y=7 at t=7, I must have been on y=7 at t=6 and stay, or on y=6 at t=6 and go up, or on y=8 and go down.\n\nBut all require being on y=6,7,8 at t=6, which is impossible due to collision.\n\nTherefore, I cannot be on y=7 at t=7.\n\nSimilarly, for y=8 at t=7 or earlier, impossible.\n\nSo the earliest I can be on y=7 is t=7? t=7, y=7 is safe, but how to get there.\n\nAt t=7, y=7 is safe, but to be on y=7 at t=7, I need to have moved there at t=6.\n\nBut at t=6, I cannot be on a position to move to y=7 except from y=6 or y=7 or y=8, which are all unsafe at t=6.\n\nTherefore, I cannot be on y=7 at t=7.\n\nSimilarly, y=8 at t=7 impossible.\n\ny=7 can be first reached at t=7? No, at t=7, if I am on y=6 at t=6 and go U, but y=6 at t=6 unsafe, cannot.\n\nSince I cannot be on y=6,7,8 at t=6, and at t=7, to be on y=7, I must come from y=6, y=7, or y=8 at t=6, but all not possible, so I cannot be on y=7 at t=7.\n\nSimilarly, not at t=8? Let's see.\n\nAt t=8, y=7 is safe.\n\nTo be on y=7 at t=8, I need to have been at y=6, y=7, or y=8 at t=7 and move accordingly.\n\nAt t=7, where can I be?\n\nAt t=7, unsafe y: only y=6, as we listed earlier.\n\nSafe y: 1,2,3,4,5,7,8,9\n\nSo I can be on y=7 at t=7, for example.\n\ny=7 at t=7 is safe.\n\nTo be on y=7 at t=7, I need to have been on y=7 at t=6 and stay, or on y=6 at t=6 and go up, or on y=8 at t=6 and go down.\n\nBut at t=6, y=6,7,8 all unsafe, so I cannot be on any of them at t=6.\n\nTherefore, I cannot be on y=7 at t=7.\n\nSimilarly, for any t, to be on y at t, I must have been on a position at t-1 that allows move.\n\nBut specifically, for t=7, since I cannot be on the adjacent rows at t=6, I cannot reach y=7 at t=7.\n\nSimilarly, y=8 at t=7 impossible.\n\nNow, can I be on y=7 at t=8?\n\nAt t=8, y=7 is safe.\n\nTo be on y=7 at t=8, I need at t=7 to be on y=6, y=7, or y=8.\n\nAt t=7, y=6 is unsafe, so I cannot be on y=6 at t=7.\n\ny=7 and y=8 are safe at t=7.\n\nSo I can be on y=7 at t=7 and stay, or on y=8 and go down, or on y=6 and go up, but y=6 unsafe, cannot.\n\nSo possible to be on y=7 at t=7 and stay for t=8, or on y=8 at t=7 and go down to y=7 at t=8.\n\nBut to be on y=7 at t=7, as above, I cannot, because at t=6 I cannot be on the required positions.\n\nTo be on y=7 at t=7, I must have been on y=7, y=6, or y=8 at t=6, all impossible.\n\nTherefore, I cannot be on y=7 at t=7.\n\nSimilarly, for t=8, to be on y=7 at t=8, I need at t=7 to be on y=6, y=7, or y=8.\n\ny=6 unsafe at t=7, cannot.\n\ny=7: can I be on y=7 at t=7? As above, no, because cannot at t=6.\n\ny=8: similarly, cannot be on y=8 at t=7 because to be there at t=7, need at t=6 to be on y=7,y=8,y=9, but y=7,8 unsafe at t=6, y=9 possible but I am not there.\n\ny=9 is safe, but at t=6, if I were on y=9, I could stay or go down, but I am at y=5 or lower.\n\nSo at t=7, I cannot be on y=7 or y=8, because I couldn't reach them at t=7.\n\nWhat positions can I be at t=7?\n\nAt t=7, I can be on y=1,2,3,4,5,7,8,9, but not y=6.\n\nBut to be on y=7,8,9 at t=7, I need to have come from somewhere.\n\nFor example, if at t=6 I am on y=5, I can go U to y=6, but at t=7 I am on y=6, not y=7.\n\nIf I am on y=4 at t=6, go U to y=5 at t=7.\n\nEtc.\n\nThe highest I can be at t=7 is y=5, by going up from y=4 at t=5 to y=5 at t=6, then if I go U at t=6, to y=6 at t=7, but y=6 unsafe at t=7.\n\nIf I go S at t=6, to y=5 at t=7.\n\nSo at t=7, I can be at y=5 or lower, but not higher than y=5.\n\nSimilarly, at t=8, I can be at y=6 if I go from y=5, but y=6 unsafe at t=8.\n\nOr stay at y=5.\n\nOr if I go to y=4, etc.\n\nSo at t=8, I can be at y=5 (safe), or lower, or if I could go to y=6, but unsafe.\n\ny=7 at t=8: to be there, I need at t=7 on y=6,7,8.\n\ny=6 unsafe at t=7, cannot.\n\ny=7: if I could be on y=7 at t=7, but I cannot, as above.\n\ny=8: similarly cannot.\n\nSo at t=7, I can only be on y<=5.\n\nThen at t=8, from y=5 at t=7, I can go U to y=6 at t=8, but y=6 unsafe at t=8, collision.\n\nOr go S to y=5 at t=8, safe.\n\nOr go D to y=4, but at t=8, y=4 is unsafe! y=4 unsafe at t=8.\n\nIf I go to y=4 at t=8, collision.\n\ny=4 at t=8 unsafe.\n\nSo at t=8, unsafe y: 4 and 6.\n\nSafe y: 1,2,3,5,7,8,9\n\nBut at t=7, I am at say y=5, safe.\n\nThen at t=7, I choose action.\n\nIf I go U to y=6, then at t=8 on y=6, unsafe.\n\nIf I go S to y=5, then at t=8 on y=5, safe.\n\nIf I go D to y=4, then at t=8 on y=4, unsafe.\n\nSo the only safe choice at t=7 if I am on y=5 is to stay S, to be on y=5 at t=8.\n\nThen at t=8, on y=5, I can go U to y=6 at t=9.\n\nThen proceed as before.\n\nSo I think the sequence I have is the fastest: reach y=6 at t=9, then to y=9 at t=12.\n\nBut from y=6 at t=9 to y=9 at t=12, that's 3 turns: t=9 to y=7, t=10 to y=8, t=11 to y=9.\n\nSo position at t=12 is y=9.\n\nActions at t=5 to t=11.\n\nH=7 actions.\n\nBut let's confirm if I can reach earlier.\n\nSuppose at t=5, I go S, stay at y=4 for t=6.\n\nt=5: a_5=S → y_6=4\n\nt=6: at y=4, safe (t=6 not unsafe for y=4)\n\nThen a_6=U → y_7=5\n\nt=7: at y=5, safe\n\na_7=S → y_8=5? Or a_7=U? If a_7=U → y_8=6, but at t=8 y=6 unsafe.\n\nSo must a_7=S → y_8=5\n\nt=8: at y=5, safe\n\na_8=U → y_9=6\n\nThen same as before.\n\nNo better.\n\nAt t=6, if I am at y=4, I could go to y=3 or something, but slower.\n\nSo I think H=7 is minimal.\n\nBut let's list the actions.\n\nTurn t=5: action U, to y=5 at t=6\n\nTurn t=6: action S, to y=5 at t=7 (stay)\n\nIn the sequence, action at turn t determines the move, but position after.\n\nIn answer, we list actions.\n\nSo for H=7:\n\nAction at t_1 = t=5: U\n\nt=6: S\n\nt=7: S  (to stay at y=5 for t=8)\n\nt=8: U  (to y=6 at t=9)\n\nt=9: U  (to y=7 at t=10)\n\nt=10: U (to y=8 at t=11)\n\nt=11: U (to y=9 at t=12)\n\nBut at t=7, action S, so y_8=5\n\nThen t=8 action U, y_9=6\n\nt=9 action U, y_10=7\n\nt=10 U, y_11=8\n\nt=11 U, y_12=9\n\nYes.\n\nBut can I save a turn by going to y=7 earlier?\n\nFor example, after t=9 at y=6, I go up to y=7, but y=7 is safe.\n\nBut I need to be on y=6 first at t=9.\n\nSince y=7 is safe at t=7, but I cannot be there because I cannot reach it.\n\nAnother idea: at t=5, go U to y=5 at t=6.\n\nThen at t=6, go U to y=6? But at t=6, if I go U, I set y_7=6, so at turn t=7, I am on y=6, which is unsafe at t=7.\n\nCollision.\n\nNot possible.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=8 at some point.\n\nBut similar issue.\n\nI think it's not possible in less than 7 turns.\n\nMinimal H=7.\n\nBut let's check the car on y=4 at t=8.\n\nIn the sequence, I avoid it by being on y=5.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nPerhaps I can go directly to y=9 without stopping.\n\nBut I have to avoid y=6 during t=6,7,8.\n\nSo I must not be on y=6 until t=9.\n\nTherefore, from y=4 to y=9, with a delay at y=5.\n\nI could be on other rows, but y=5 is fine.\n\nSo I think H=7 is the minimal.\n\nNow, in the answer format.\n\nActions for t=5 to t=11.\n\nt_1 =5, so actions at t_1, t_1+1, ..., t_1+6 for H=7.\n\nt from 0 to H-1=6, so t_1 + t for t=0 to 6: turns 5,6,7,8,9,10,11.\n\nActions: U, S, S, U, U, U, U\n\nIn the sequence: at t=5:U, t=6:S, t=7:S, t=8:U, t=9:U, t=10:U, t=11:U\n\nBut at t=7: S, so I stay at y=5 for t=8.\n\nThen t=8: U to y=6 at t=9.\n\nYes.\n\nTo write the answer.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 5 and 6, there are unsafe times, but in this sequence, I don't encounter them.\n\nFor example, y=5 unsafe at t=16, but I am there at t=6,7,8, which is early, safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nPerhaps I can have a different sequence with same H.\n\nFor example, at t=5, I stay S, then at t=6 go U to y=5, etc, but same number of steps.\n\nOr at t=6, if I go D to y=4, but then at t=7 go U to y=5, same.\n\nSo no gain.\n\nThus minimal H=7.\n\nNow, write the answer.\n\nThe sequence:\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: S\n\nTurn 7: S\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let's confirm the positions:\n\nt=5: y=4, action U, so y_6=5\n\nt=6: y=5, action S, so y_7=5\n\nt=7: y=5, action S, so y_8=5\n\nt=8: y=5, action U, so y_9=6\n\nt=9: y=6, action U, so y_10=7\n\nt=10: y=7, action U, so y_11=8\n\nt=11: y=8, action U, so y_12=9\n\nAt each turn, collision check:\n\nt=5: y=4, freeway 4, at T=5, no car covers 0, safe.\n\nt=6: y=5, freeway 5, at T=6, Δt=1, cars: only one, span [-55+4(1), -44+4(1)] = [-51,-40], 0 not in, safe.\n\nt=7: y=5, T=7, Δt=2, span [-55+8, -44+8] = [-47,-36], 0 not in, safe.\n\nt=8: y=5, T=8, Δt=3, span [-55+12, -44+12] = [-43,-32], 0 not in, safe.\n\nt=9: y=6, freeway 6, T=9, Δt=4, cars: third car span [-15+16, -4+16] = [1,12], min=1>0, not cover; first car not cover, etc. safe.\n\nt=10: y=7, freeway 7, T=10, Δt=5, cars: first car [-23+60, -12+60]=[37,48]>0; second [49+60,60+60]=[109,120]>0, safe.\n\nt=11: y=8, similar, safe.\n\nt=12: y=9, no freeway, safe.\n\nPerfect.\n\nSo H=7.\n\nBut the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and I think 7 is minimal.\n\nPerhaps I can reach at t=11 or earlier.\n\nSuppose at t=8, I am at y=5, and I go U, but to y=6 at t=9.\n\nIf at t=8 I could be higher, but I cannot.\n\nAnother path: suppose I go to y=3 at some point, but it takes more steps.\n\nFor example, at t=5, go D to y=3 at t=6.\n\nt=6: at y=3, safe.\n\nThen go U to y=4 at t=7.\n\nt=7: at y=4, safe (t=7 not unsafe).\n\nThen go U to y=5 at t=8.\n\nt=8: at y=5, safe.\n\nThen go U to y=6 at t=9, same as before, but I took an extra down and up, so more turns.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo H=7 is minimal.\n\nThus the sequence.\n</think>\nTo reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from \\((0, 4)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 5\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\), the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 7.

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 7, and the player is at (0,5). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on freeways 1 to 8 (which are the rows y=1 to y=8). The player moves vertically: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), S (stay, y unchanged). The player's y must be in [0,9].\n\nImportant: Collision occurs at turn T if at that turn the player is on a freeway k (i.e., y_T = k) and the car on that freeway has a span that covers 0 (the x-coordinate of the player) at that exact turn T.\n\nNote: When the player moves from y_T to y_{T+1} at turn T, at the moment of turn T the player is still on y_T. So at turn T, we check the freeway y_T for collision. Then, at the next turn, we will be on y_{T+1}.\n\nWe are given the state at turn t1=7 for the cars. Each car is defined by (head, tail, direction, speed). The update for a car from turn t1 to a future turn T (>=t1) is:\n- For left-moving (direction left): the car moves left. The span at T is [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)] (note: in the problem, for left-moving the initial span is [h, tau] and h>tau? Actually, the problem states: left-moving: Span(t1)= [h, tau] -> becomes [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]. But note that if the car is moving left, then the head is the rightmost point? Actually, the problem says for left-moving: the car moves to the left, so the entire segment shifts left.\n\nHowever, note the representation: \n- For left-moving: the initial span is given as (head, tail). In the example for freeway 3: (24,47, left,24). If it's moving left, then at t1=7, the car is from 24 to 47? But then as time goes by, the car moves left so the numbers decrease.\n\nBut wait: the problem says for left-moving: \n  Span(t1) = [h, tau] -> becomes [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut note: if the car is moving left, then the head (front) is at the right? Actually, the problem says \"head\" and \"tail\". In a left-moving car, the head is the front, which is the leftmost part? Or the rightmost? Let me see the update: it shifts the entire segment to the left (decreasing x). So if at t1, the car is from h to tau (with h>tau, meaning h is the right end and tau the left? or vice versa?) — but the update formula subtracts the same amount, so the relative positions remain.\n\nActually, the problem states for left-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, tau]\" and then becomes [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]. This implies that the car is a contiguous segment. However, the order of h and tau is not specified. But note: for a left-moving car, if h is the head (front) and tau the tail, then the head should be the leftmost point? But in the update, both h and tau are being reduced by the same amount, so the head (h) is the rightmost? Because if the car moves left, the head (front) would be the leftmost and then the tail would be to the right? That doesn't match.\n\nLooking at the right-moving update: \n  Span(t1) = [tau, h] -> becomes [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nSo for right-moving, the initial span is [tau, h] meaning from tau to h (with tau < h) and then it shifts right. \n\nBut for left-moving, the initial span is [h, tau] — which might be from h to tau, and if h>tau then it's from high to low? That would be the same as [tau, h] but in reverse? But the update subtracts, so if h>tau, then after subtracting, the segment becomes [h - s*dt, tau - s*dt] and if h>tau then the segment is still contiguous? Actually, it's a closed interval? \n\nThe problem states: collision if 0 is in the span at turn T.\n\nSo we can interpret the car as occupying the interval [min(h,tau), max(h,tau)]? But wait, the update for left-moving: if the initial span is [h, tau] and the car moves left, then the entire segment shifts left. However, the problem does not specify the order. But note the right-moving case: they write [tau, h] and then shift right. So for consistency, I think we should interpret:\n\n- For a left-moving car: the head is the rightmost point and the tail is the leftmost? Then the initial span is [tail, head] = [tau, head]? But the problem writes (h, tau) and then in the update for left-moving they write [h, tau] -> [h - s*dt, tau - s*dt]. If h>tau, then the car is from tau to h (but written as [h, tau] meaning from h down to tau? That doesn't make sense). Alternatively, the problem might have written the head and tail without regard to order? But the update formula is symmetric: subtracting the same amount.\n\nActually, regardless of the order, the car occupies the interval between the two numbers. So we can define the car's position at time T as the interval [min(h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)), max(h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1))] for left-moving? But wait, the update formula subtracts the same amount to both, so the relative order of h and tau doesn't change? \n\nLooking at the given data, for freeway 1: (12,1,right,12) — but wait, the freeway 1 has two cars: (12,1,right,12) and (-36,-47,right,12). For a right-moving car, the update uses [tau, h] and then adds. So for the first car on freeway1: (head=12, tail=1, direction=right, speed=12). Then at time t1=7, the span is [tau, h] = [1,12]. Then at time T, it becomes [1+12*(T-7), 12+12*(T-7)].\n\nSimilarly, for a left-moving car: freeway3: (24,47,left,24). Then at t1=7, the span is [24,47]? But then at time T, it becomes [24-24*(T-7), 47-24*(T-7)]. However, note that 24-24*(T-7) might become less than 47-24*(T-7) if T>7? Actually, 24-24*(T-7) is less than 47-24*(T-7) because 24<47. So the interval becomes [24-24*(T-7), 47-24*(T-7)].\n\nBut wait: if the car is left-moving, then the head should be the front? The problem says \"head\" and \"tail\". In the update for left-moving, they write [h, tau] and then subtract. So in the example, h=24 and tau=47. Then the head is 24 and the tail is 47? That would imply the head is the left end? Then the car is from 24 to 47? But when moving left, the head (front) is at the left? Then the entire car moves left. So at T, the head is 24 - 24*(T-7) and the tail is 47 - 24*(T-7). So the car occupies [24-24*(T-7), 47-24*(T-7)]? But that interval is of length 23, and moving left.\n\nSo in summary, for any car at time T (>=t1) on freeway k:\n- If direction is right: the car occupies [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)] (since at t1 it was [tau, h] and then we add s*(T-t1) to both)\n- If direction is left: the car occupies [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)] (and note that h and tau are given, and we subtract s*(T-t1) from both)\n\nBut note: the problem states for left-moving: initial span [h, tau] and then becomes [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]. So the interval at time T is [min(h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)), max(h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1))]? Actually, the update formula doesn't specify the order, but the collision condition is if 0 is in the interval. So we can compute the interval as [min, max] of the two endpoints.\n\nHowever, in the right-moving case, the initial representation is [tau, h] meaning tau is the left end and h the right? Then the update is [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)] which is increasing. Similarly, for left-moving, if at t1 we have [h, tau] and we subtract, then if h < tau, the interval would be [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)] and if h>tau, then it would be [tau - s*(T-t1), h - s*(T-t1)]? But the problem doesn't specify the relative order of h and tau.\n\nLooking at the data: \n- For freeway1: (12,1,right,12) -> so h=12, tau=1. Then at t1, the span is [1,12] for the right-moving car? So tau=1 is the left end, h=12 the right end. That makes sense: the car is from 1 to 12 at t1=7.\n- For freeway3: (24,47,left,24) -> h=24, tau=47. Then at t1, the span is [24,47]. Since it's left-moving, and we subtract, the car is from 24 to 47 at t1=7? But if the car is moving left, then at a later time the entire segment shifts left. However, the head is 24 and tail 47? That would imply the head is the left end? Then the car is from 24 (head) to 47 (tail). Then when moving left, the head (front) goes to 24 - 24*(T-7) and the tail goes to 47 - 24*(T-7). So the interval is [24-24*(T-7), 47-24*(T-7)].\n\nBut note: the car on freeway3 at t1=7 is from 24 to 47. The player is at x=0. So at t1=7, 0 is not in [24,47]. But as time goes by, the car moves left. So we need to check at each turn T if 0 is in the interval.\n\nSimilarly, for the other cars.\n\nThe goal: move the player from y=5 at turn 7 to y=9 at some turn T (>=7) without ever having a collision. We want the minimal number of turns H (so the sequence of actions from turn7 to turn7+H-1, and at the last action (turn7+H-1) we end at y=9).\n\nThe player can only change by at most 1 per turn. The minimal number of moves to go from 5 to 9 is 4 (if we go up every turn). But we have to avoid collisions.\n\nWe need to check for each freeway k (from 1 to 8) and for each turn T (>=7) when the player is on that freeway (i.e., when y_T = k) that 0 is not in the span of any car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nNote: the freeway k has multiple cars? Yes, for example freeway1 has two cars. So we must avoid any of them.\n\nWe are at turn7: the player is at y=5. So we are not on freeway5? Actually, freeways are y=1 to 8. The player is at y=5 at turn7, so we must check freeway5 at turn7: are there cars on freeway5 at turn7 that have 0 in their span?\n\nFreeway5: (-36,-47,right,4). This is a right-moving car. At t1=7, the span is [tau, h] = [-47, -36]? (because the problem says for right-moving: [tau, h] and then becomes [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]. But note: the given data is (head, tail) = (-36, -47). Then for right-moving, we are to represent the span as [tau, h]. So tau is the tail and h is the head. Then tau = -47, h = -36. So at t1=7, the car is from -47 to -36. Then at turn7, the car is at [-47, -36]. The player is at x=0, which is not in [-47,-36]? So no collision at turn7.\n\nSimilarly, we need to plan the next moves.\n\nWe want to go from y=5 to y=9. The direct path: we can go up 4 times: U,U,U,U. Then we would be at:\n  Turn7: at y=5 -> check freeway5: as above, no collision.\n  Turn8: we move U to y=6 -> check freeway6 at turn8.\n  Turn9: move U to y=7 -> check freeway7 at turn9.\n  Turn10: move U to y=8 -> check freeway8 at turn10.\n  Turn11: move U to y=9 -> but note: we are at y=9 at turn11. However, freeway9 does not exist (freeways only 1-8). So when we are at y=9, we are safe. But note: we must avoid collisions on the way.\n\nSo we need to check the freeways at the times we are on them.\n\nLet me compute the positions of the cars at the required turns.\n\nFirst, for the direct path (4 moves: U at turn7, turn8, turn9, turn10) and then at turn11 we are at y=9 and done.\n\n- At turn7: y=5 -> check freeway5: car at [-47, -36] (as above) -> 0 not in interval -> safe.\n- At turn8: y=6 -> check freeway6 at turn8 (T=8, dt=1).\n  Freeway6 has three cars: \n      (-36,-47,right,4), \n      (40,29,right,4) -> wait, this is given as (head, tail) = (40,29). For right-moving, we represent as [tau, h] -> [29,40] at t1=7? But note: the problem says for right-moving: the initial span is [tau, h]. So if head=40, tail=29, then tau=29, h=40? Then at t1=7: [29,40]. Then at T=8: [29+4*(8-7), 40+4*(8-7)] = [33,44]. 0 not in [33,44] -> safe.\n      (4,-7,right,4) -> [tau, h] = [-7,4] at t1=7? Then at T=8: [-7+4, 4+4] = [-3,8]. 0 is in [-3,8]? -> collision! So we cannot be on freeway6 at turn8.\n\nTherefore, the direct path is blocked at turn8 (freeway6) because of the car (4,-7,right,4) becomes [-3,8] at turn8, and 0 is in that interval.\n\nSo we must avoid being on freeway6 at turn8.\n\nWe have to consider alternative paths. We can:\n  - Delay the upward movement by one turn: at turn7 we stay (S) or go down (D) and then go up later? But going down might lead to collisions on lower freeways and also it would take more moves.\n  - Or we can wait until freeway6 is clear at a later turn? But note that the cars are moving. For freeway6, the car that caused the problem: (4,-7,right,4) -> at turn7: [-7,4] -> at turn8: [-3,8] -> at turn9: [1,12] -> at turn10: [5,16] -> at turn11: [9,20] -> so 0 is only in the interval at turn8? Actually, at turn7: [-7,4] contains 0? Yes, it does. But at turn7 we are not on freeway6 (we are at y=5 at turn7). At turn8 we are on freeway6 and the car is [-3,8] which contains 0. At turn9: [1,12] does not contain 0? Actually, 1 to 12: 0 is not in [1,12]? Correct. So if we can be on freeway6 at turn9, then we avoid the collision.\n\nBut note: we are at y=5 at turn7. We want to be at y=9. How can we adjust?\n\nOption 1: \n  Turn7: S (stay at y=5) -> then at turn8, we are still at y=5? Then we must check freeway5 at turn8? \n      Freeway5: only one car (-36,-47,right,4). At t1=7: [-47,-36]. At turn8: [-47+4, -36+4] = [-43,-32] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n  Then turn8: U to y=6 -> now at turn8: we are at y=6? But at turn8, the freeway6 car (the one that was (4,-7,right,4)) is at [-3,8] -> collision? So we cannot go to y=6 at turn8.\n\nOption 2: \n  Turn7: D to y=4 -> then at turn7 we are moving from y=5 to y=4. But at turn7 we are still at y=5? Then we check freeway5: safe as above. Then at turn8: we are at y=4 -> check freeway4 at turn8.\n\nFreeway4: three cars: \n  (36,25,right,12) -> at t1=7: [25,36]? Because for right-moving: [tau, h] -> tau=25, h=36? Then at turn8: [25+12,36+12] = [37,48] -> safe.\n  (-48,-59,right,12) -> [tau, h] = [-59,-48] -> turn8: [-59+12, -48+12] = [-47,-36] -> safe.\n  (-12,-23,right,12) -> [tau, h] = [-23,-12] -> turn8: [-23+12, -12+12] = [-11,0] -> 0 is in this interval? Because -11<=0<=0? So collision at turn8 on freeway4.\n\nSo if we go down to y=4 at turn8, we get a collision on freeway4 at turn8.\n\nOption 3: \n  Turn7: U to y=6 -> but then at turn7 we are at y=5? Then we check freeway5: safe. Then at turn8: we are at y=6 -> collision as we saw.\n\nSo we must avoid being on freeway6 at turn8. And we cannot be on freeway4 at turn8? Also, we must avoid freeway6 at turn8.\n\nAlternative: wait at y=5 for one turn? Then at turn8 we are at y=5. Then at turn9, we can go U to y=6. Then we are on freeway6 at turn9.\n\nAt turn9, freeway6: \n  Car1: (-36,-47,right,4) -> at t1=7: [-47,-36] -> turn9: [-47+4*2, -36+4*2] = [-39,-28] -> safe.\n  Car2: (40,29,right,4) -> at t1=7: [29,40] -> turn9: [29+8,40+8] = [37,48] -> safe.\n  Car3: (4,-7,right,4) -> at t1=7: [-7,4] -> turn9: [-7+8,4+8] = [1,12] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\nSo at turn9, freeway6 is safe.\n\nThen we can:\n  Turn7: S (stay at y=5) -> safe (freeway5: at turn7: [-47,-36] -> safe; at turn8: we are at y=5 again -> check freeway5 at turn8: [-47+4, -36+4] = [-43,-32] -> safe)\n  Turn8: U to y=6 -> at turn8: we are at y=6? But we must check freeway6 at turn8: the car (4,-7,right,4) is at [-3,8] -> collision? So we cannot do U at turn8.\n\nBut wait: at turn8 we are moving from y=5 to y=6. At turn8, we are at y=5? Then we check freeway5 at turn8: safe. Then at turn9: we are at y=6? Then we check freeway6 at turn9: safe as above.\n\nThe rule: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} != y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T\". So at turn T, we are on y_T. Then at the next turn (T+1) we are on y_{T+1}.\n\nTherefore:\n  Turn7: S -> at turn7: y=5 -> check freeway5: safe.\n  Turn8: S -> at turn8: y=5 -> check freeway5 at turn8: safe (as above).\n  Turn9: U -> at turn9: we are at y=6? Actually, at turn9, we are at y=6? But we must check freeway6 at turn9: safe.\n\nBut then we have to continue:\n  Turn10: U to y=7 -> at turn10: we are at y=7? Check freeway7 at turn10.\n  Turn11: U to y=8 -> check freeway8 at turn11.\n  Turn12: U to y=9 -> done.\n\nSo total turns: from turn7 to turn12: 6 turns (H=6: actions at turns7,8,9,10,11).\n\nBut can we do better? We lost 2 turns (we did two S at turn7 and turn8) and then started going up.\n\nAlternatively, can we go up to y=7 earlier? We were at y=5 at turn7. We want to be at y=7 at turn9? But to avoid freeway6 at turn8, we cannot go through freeway6 at turn8. So we must avoid being at y=6 at turn8.\n\nBut we can be at y=7 at turn9? How? \n  Turn7: U to y=6 -> but at turn7 we are at y=5? Then we check freeway5: safe. Then at turn8: we are at y=6 -> collision? So we cannot do that.\n\nSo the only way to avoid freeway6 at turn8 is to not be at y=6 at turn8. So we must either stay at y=5 or go down to y=4 at turn8? But we saw that going down to y=4 at turn8 causes a collision on freeway4.\n\nTherefore, we have to stay at y=5 for at least one extra turn? But we did two S? Actually, we only need to avoid being at y=6 at turn8. So we can do:\n\nOption: \n  Turn7: S -> stay at y=5 (turn7: safe, turn8: at y=5 -> safe)\n  Turn8: U -> to y=6 at turn9? But at turn8: we are at y=5? Then at turn9: we are at y=6 -> then we check freeway6 at turn9: safe.\n\nThen we can:\n  Turn9: at y=6 -> safe.\n  Turn10: U to y=7 -> at turn10: check freeway7.\n\nNow, freeway7 at turn10 (T=10, dt=3): \n  Cars on freeway7: two cars: (12,1,right,12) and (-36,-47,right,12)\n  For (12,1,right,12): at t1=7: [1,12] -> at T=10: [1+12*3, 12+12*3] = [1+36,12+36]=[37,48] -> safe.\n  For (-36,-47,right,12): at t1=7: [-47,-36] -> at T=10: [-47+36, -36+36] = [-11,0] -> 0 is in [-11,0]? Yes, because -11<=0<=0 -> collision.\n\nSo at turn10, if we are at y=7, we collide with the car (-36,-47,right,12) which at turn10 is at [-11,0].\n\nSo we must avoid freeway7 at turn10.\n\nWe can try to delay the move to freeway7 until turn11? Then we would be at y=7 at turn11.\n\nAt turn11: freeway7 cars:\n  (12,1,right,12): [1+12*4, 12+12*4] = [49,60] -> safe.\n  (-36,-47,right,12): [-47+12*4, -36+12*4] = [-47+48, -36+48] = [1,12] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\nSo freeway7 is safe at turn11.\n\nTherefore, we can:\n  Turn7: S (y=5)\n  Turn8: S (y=5)\n  Turn9: U (to y=6 at turn9) -> safe (freeway6 at turn9: safe as above)\n  Turn10: U -> we would be at y=7 at turn10? But that causes collision? So we cannot.\n\nBut we can do:\n  Turn9: at y=6 -> safe.\n  Turn10: S (stay at y=6) -> then at turn10: we are at y=6 -> check freeway6 at turn10.\n\nFreeway6 at turn10 (T=10, dt=3):\n  Car1: (-36,-47,right,4) -> [-47+4*3, -36+4*3] = [-47+12, -36+12] = [-35,-24] -> safe.\n  Car2: (40,29,right,4) -> [29+12,40+12] = [41,52] -> safe.\n  Car3: (4,-7,right,4) -> [-7+12,4+12] = [5,16] -> safe.\n\nThen turn11: U to y=7 -> at turn11: we are at y=7 -> check freeway7 at turn11: safe (as above: [1,12] and [1,12] for the second car? Actually, the second car: [-36,-47,right,12] at turn11: [-47+48, -36+48] = [1,12] -> 0 not in).\n\nThen:\n  Turn12: U to y=8 -> at turn12: check freeway8 at turn12.\n\nFreeway8 at turn12 (T=12, dt=5):\n  Cars: (12,1,right,12) and (-36,-47,right,12)\n  (12,1,right,12): [1+12*5, 12+12*5] = [1+60,12+60]=[61,72] -> safe.\n  (-36,-47,right,12): [-47+60, -36+60] = [13,24] -> safe.\n\nThen turn13: U to y=9 -> done.\n\nBut this takes 7 turns: from turn7 to turn13 (actions at turns7,8,9,10,11,12,13) -> H=7.\n\nWe want minimal H. Maybe we can do better.\n\nAlternatively, we could go up to y=7 at a different time? Or even go down and then up? But that might take more moves.\n\nAnother idea: go up to y=6 at a time when freeway6 is safe (like turn9) and then go to y=7 at a time when freeway7 is safe (like turn11). So:\n\n  Turn7: S (y=5) -> safe\n  Turn8: S (y=5) -> safe\n  Turn9: U (y=6) -> safe (turn9: freeway6 safe)\n  Turn10: S (y=6) -> safe (turn10: freeway6 safe)\n  Turn11: U (y=7) -> safe (turn11: freeway7 safe)\n  Turn12: U (y=8) -> safe (turn12: freeway8 safe) [we computed above: freeway8 at turn12 safe? We did for turn12: freeway8 cars: [61,72] and [13,24] -> safe]\n  Turn13: U (y=9) -> done.\n\nThat is 7 turns.\n\nBut note: we are at y=8 at turn12, then turn13: U to y=9 -> so we are done at turn13. But we started at turn7. So the sequence is for t=7 to t=13 (7 actions: 6 steps?).\n\nWait, H is the number of turns we are taking. We start at turn7 and we take actions at turn7, turn8, ... until the last action at turn7+H-1 and then we are at y=9 at the end of that action.\n\nSo we have H actions: from t=7 to t=7+H-1.\n\nWe want minimal H.\n\nIs there a way to avoid waiting so long? We can try to go to y=7 at turn11? But we are at y=5 at turn7. We need to go from 5 to 7: that takes 2 moves. But we have to avoid freeway6 at turn8 and freeway7 at turn10.\n\nHow about:\n  Turn7: U to y=6? -> at turn7: we are at y=5 -> safe. Then at turn8: we are at y=6 -> collision? So we cannot.\n\n  Turn7: S -> y=5 (safe)\n  Turn8: U -> then at turn8: we are at y=5? Then at turn9: y=6 -> safe (freeway6 at turn9 safe). Then at turn9: we are at y=6. Then we can go to y=7 at turn10? But freeway7 at turn10 is not safe.\n\n  So we must wait until turn11 to be at y=7.\n\nTherefore, the earliest we can be at y=7 is turn11.\n\nThen we can be at y=8 at turn12 and y=9 at turn13. So minimal H=7.\n\nBut let's check if we can go faster from y=7 to y=9? We can only move one per turn. So from y=7 at turn11 to y=9 at turn13: that's 2 moves.\n\nBut what if we try to skip freeway7? We cannot because we have to go through y=7 and y=8 to get to y=9.\n\nAlternatively, we could go to y=4 or y=3 and then up? But that would take more moves.\n\nLet me check freeway8 at turn11? We might be able to go to y=8 earlier? But we are at y=7 at turn11. Then at turn12 we go to y=8. Then at turn13 to y=9.\n\nBut we have to be at y=8 at turn12. We computed freeway8 at turn12: safe.\n\nIs there a way to be at y=8 earlier? For example, at turn10? But to be at y=8 at turn10, we would have to be at y=7 at turn9. But to be at y=7 at turn9, we would have to be at y=6 at turn8 -> which we cannot because freeway6 at turn8 is not safe.\n\nSo the plan we have is:\n\n  Turn7: S\n  Turn8: S\n  Turn9: U\n  Turn10: S   (or we could do U? But then we would be at y=7 at turn10 -> collision on freeway7. So we must do S at turn10 to stay at y=6)\n  Turn11: U   -> to y=7 (safe at turn11)\n  Turn12: U   -> to y=8 (safe at turn12)\n  Turn13: U   -> to y=9\n\nBut note: at turn10, we are at y=6 and we do S -> so we stay at y=6. Then at turn11, we do U to y=7 -> safe.\n\nWe can try to avoid the S at turn10? How? We want to go from y=6 at turn9 to y=7 at turn10? But freeway7 at turn10 is not safe. So we must avoid.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 7.\n\nBut wait: we started at turn7. The actions are for turns: 7,8,9,10,11,12,13 -> 7 actions. So H=7.\n\nBut is there a way to do it in 6? We need to get from 5 to 9 in 4 moves, but we have to avoid two collisions: one at freeway6 at turn8 and one at freeway7 at turn10. The earliest we can be at freeway6 safely is turn9, and the earliest we can be at freeway7 safely is turn11. Then we have to be at y=7 at turn11. Then we go up to y=9 at turn13 (which is 2 more moves). So total moves: \n  turn7: we are at y=5.\n  turn9: we can be at y=6 (by turn7: S, turn8: U -> but wait, at turn8 we do U: then at turn9 we are at y=6? But at turn8 we are at y=5 (if we did S at turn7) then at turn8 we do U: then at turn9 we are at y=6 -> safe. Then at turn9 we do U: then at turn10 we are at y=7 -> collision? So we have to wait at y=6 until turn11? Then at turn11 we go to y=7 -> safe. Then turn12: to y=8, turn13: to y=9.\n\nSo we cannot skip the wait at y=6.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 7.\n\nNow, we must write the sequence:\n\nTurn7: S\nTurn8: S\nTurn9: U\nTurn10: S   (wait at y=6 for one turn to avoid freeway7 at turn10)\nTurn11: U\nTurn12: U\nTurn13: U\n\nBut wait: at turn13 we do U to go from y=8 to y=9.\n\nBut let me verify the entire path:\n\nTurn7: \n  Action: S -> y7 = 5\n  Check freeway5 at turn7: car (-36,-47,right,4) -> [-47,-36] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\nTurn8:\n  Action: S -> y8 = 5\n  Check freeway5 at turn8: car: [-47+4, -36+4] = [-43,-32] -> safe.\n\nTurn9:\n  Action: U -> then at turn9: we are at y=6? Actually, we start turn9 at y=5? Then we move U: so at turn9 we are at y=6? \n  Check freeway6 at turn9: \n        car1: (-36,-47,right,4) -> [-47+4*2, -36+4*2] = [-39,-28] -> safe.\n        car2: (40,29,right,4) -> [29+8,40+8]=[37,48] -> safe.\n        car3: (4,-7,right,4) -> [-7+8,4+8]=[1,12] -> safe.\n\nTurn10:\n  Action: S -> stay at y=6.\n  Check freeway6 at turn10: \n        car1: [-47+4*3, -36+4*3] = [-35,-24] -> safe.\n        car2: [29+12,40+12]=[41,52] -> safe.\n        car3: [-7+12,4+12]=[5,16] -> safe.\n\nTurn11:\n  Action: U -> to y=7.\n  Check freeway7 at turn11: \n        car1: (12,1,right,12) -> [1+12*4, 12+12*4] = [49,60] -> safe.\n        car2: (-36,-47,right,12) -> [-47+48, -36+48] = [1,12] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\nTurn12:\n  Action: U -> to y=8.\n  Check freeway8 at turn12:\n        car1: (12,1,right,12) -> [1+12*5, 12+12*5] = [61,72] -> safe.\n        car2: (-36,-47,right,12) -> [-47+60, -36+60] = [13,24] -> safe.\n\nTurn13:\n  Action: U -> to y=9. \n  We don't check freeways because y=9 is not a freeway (only 1-8).\n\nSo we reach y=9 at turn13.\n\nBut is there a way to do it in 6 turns? We need to reach y=9 at turn7+5 (since H=6: actions at t7 to t7+5 = t12). Then we would be at y=9 at turn12.\n\nBut we are at y=5 at turn7. We need to gain 4 levels. In 5 moves (from turn7 to turn11: 5 actions) we can gain at most 5 levels? So we can get to y=10? But we are bounded by [0,9]. So we can only get to y=9 at the earliest at turn7+4? But that was blocked.\n\nBut with 5 moves (H=5): \n  We start at turn7: y=5.\n  After 5 moves (turn7 to turn11): we can be at y=5+ (number of U minus number of D) in 5 moves.\n\nTo get to y=9 we need +4. So we must have 4 U and 1 non-U (which could be S or D). But if we do 4U and 1S, we end at y=9. The moves can be in any order.\n\nBut we have to avoid collisions.\n\nWe need to be at y=9 at the last move (turn7+5-1 = turn11).\n\nThe path: \n  turn7: action1\n  turn8: action2\n  turn9: action3\n  turn10: action4\n  turn11: action5\n\nAnd at the end of turn11 (after action5) we are at y=9.\n\nWe must also be safe at every intermediate turn.\n\nWe must avoid being at y=6 at turn8 (because of freeway6) and at y=7 at turn10 (because of freeway7).\n\nConsider:\n\n  Option A: \n    turn7: U -> to y=6 at turn8 -> collision at turn8? So no.\n\n  Option B:\n    turn7: S -> y=5 at turn8 -> safe (freeway5 at turn8: safe)\n    turn8: U -> to y=6 at turn9 -> safe (freeway6 at turn9: safe)\n    turn9: U -> to y=7 at turn10 -> collision? freeway7 at turn10: car2 at [-11,0] -> collision.\n\n  Option C:\n    turn7: S -> y=5 at turn8 -> safe.\n    turn8: S -> y=5 at turn9 -> safe (freeway5 at turn9: [-47+4*2, -36+4*2] = [-39,-28] -> safe)\n    turn9: U -> to y=6 at turn10 -> then at turn10: we are at y=6 -> safe (freeway6 at turn10: safe as above)\n    turn10: U -> to y=7 at turn11 -> safe (freeway7 at turn11: safe)\n    turn11: U -> to y=8 at turn11? But we need to be at y=9 at the end of turn11. So we are at y=8 -> not 9.\n\n  Option D:\n    turn7: S -> y=5 at turn8.\n    turn8: U -> to y=6 at turn9 -> safe.\n    turn9: S -> at turn9: y=6 -> safe? Then at turn10: we are at y=6? Then we do U at turn10: to y=7 at turn11 -> but then we are at y=7 at turn11, then we need one more U to get to y=8 at turn12? Not enough for H=5.\n\n  Option E: use a D? \n    turn7: D -> to y=4 at turn8. \n        At turn7: y=5 -> safe.\n        At turn8: y=4 -> freeway4 at turn8: \n              car3: (-12,-23,right,12) -> [-23+12, -12+12] = [-11,0] -> collision.\n\n  Option F: \n    turn7: U -> blocked as before.\n\nTherefore, it seems impossible to do in 5 moves. So minimal H is 6? Or 7?\n\nWait, we have 5 moves? H=5 means we take 5 actions: from turn7 to turn11. We end at turn11 at y=9. But we need to be at y=9 at the last action. We start at y=5. We need 4 net up moves. So we can do 4U and 1S? Then we end at y=9.\n\nBut in the moves, we must avoid the collisions.\n\nLet me try:\n\n  Turn7: S -> y=5 at turn8 -> safe.\n  Turn8: U -> y=6 at turn9 -> safe (freeway6 at turn9: safe)\n  Turn9: S -> y=6 at turn10 -> safe (freeway6 at turn10: safe)\n  Turn10: U -> y=7 at turn11 -> safe (freeway7 at turn11: safe)\n  Turn11: U -> y=8 at turn11? But we are at turn11: we do U -> then we go to y=8? But we need to get to y=9. \n\nWait, at turn11 we do the fifth action: U. Then we go from y=7 (at the start of turn11) to y=8 at the end of turn11. We are not at y=9.\n\nTo get to y=9, we would need one more U.\n\nSo with 5 actions we can only get to y=8? Then we need a sixth action to get to y=9.\n\nSo minimal H must be at least 6? But with 6 actions we can get to y=9.\n\nLet me try with 6 actions (H=6: actions at turn7 to turn12) and end at y=9 at turn12.\n\n  We need to be at y=9 at the end of turn12.\n\n  We can try:\n      turn7: S (y=5 at turn8)\n      turn8: U (y=6 at turn9) -> safe\n      turn9: U (y=7 at turn10) -> collision at freeway7 at turn10.\n\n  turn7: S\n  turn8: U (y=6 at turn9) -> safe\n  turn9: S (y=6 at turn10) -> safe\n  turn10: U (y=7 at turn11) -> safe\n  turn11: U (y=8 at turn12) -> safe (freeway8 at turn12: safe as before)\n  turn12: U (y=9 at turn12) -> done.\n\nBut wait, at turn12 we do U and we go from y=8 to y=9. Then we are at y=9 at the end of turn12.\n\nAnd we have 6 actions: turn7 to turn12.\n\nNow, check the entire path:\n\n  Turn7: action S -> at turn7: y=5 -> check freeway5: safe.\n          Then we end turn7 at y=5? Then at the beginning of turn8 we are at y=5.\n\n  Turn8: action U -> then at turn8: we are still at y=5? (because we haven't moved yet at the moment of collision check) -> check freeway5 at turn8: safe.\n          Then we move to y=6 -> but for turn8, we are not on freeway6 until turn9? \n\n  Important: at turn8, we are at y=5. Then we do U: so at turn9 we will be at y=6. But at turn8, we are at y=5 -> safe.\n\n  Turn9: we start at y=6? Then we do action U? Or in this plan we do action S at turn9? \n\n  Let me write step by step:\n\n      At the start of turn7: y=5.\n      Turn7: do S -> then at the end of turn7, y=5. \n             During turn7: we are at y=5 -> check freeway5: safe.\n\n      At the start of turn8: y=5.\n      Turn8: do U -> then during turn8: we are at y=5 -> check freeway5: safe. \n             Then we move to y=6 -> so at the start of turn9: y=6.\n\n      Turn9: do S -> then during turn9: we are at y=6 -> check freeway6: \n             cars: \n                 car1: [-47+4*(9-7), -36+4*(9-7)] = [-47+8, -36+8] = [-39,-28] -> safe.\n                 car2: [29+4*2,40+4*2] = [37,48] -> safe.\n                 car3: [-7+8,4+8] = [1,12] -> safe.\n\n      Then at the end of turn9: y=6.\n\n      Turn10: do U -> during turn10: we are at y=6 -> check freeway6: \n             car1: [-47+4*(10-7), -36+4*3] = [-35,-24] -> safe.\n             car2: [29+12,40+12]=[41,52] -> safe.\n             car3: [-7+12,4+12]=[5,16] -> safe.\n             Then we move to y=7 -> at the start of turn11: y=7.\n\n      Turn11: do U -> during turn11: we are at y=7 -> check freeway7: \n             car1: [1+12*(11-7), 12+12*4] = [49,60] -> safe.\n             car2: [-47+12*4, -36+48] = [1,12] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n             Then we move to y=8 -> at the start of turn12: y=8.\n\n      Turn12: do U -> during turn12: we are at y=8 -> check freeway8: \n             car1: [1+12*(12-7), 12+60] = [61,72] -> safe.\n             car2: [-47+12*5, -36+60] = [13,24] -> safe.\n             Then we move to y=9.\n\n      Done.\n\nThis is 6 actions: \n  Turn7: S\n  Turn8: U\n  Turn9: S\n  Turn10: U\n  Turn11: U\n  Turn12: U\n\nAnd we end at y=9 at turn12.\n\nTotal turns: 6.\n\nBut wait, at turn11 we are at y=7 and we do U -> to y=8 at turn12? Then at turn12 we do U again -> to y=9 at turn12? But we can only do one move per turn. So at turn12 we start at y=8 and then do U to go to y=9.\n\nSo the sequence is:\n\n  Turn7: S\n  Turn8: U\n  Turn9: S\n  Turn10: U\n  Turn11: U\n  Turn12: U\n\nAnd we are at y=9 at the end of turn12.\n\nBut note: the action at turn12 is U, and after that we are at y=9.\n\nIs this minimal? H=6.\n\nBut earlier we thought we needed 7. But we found a way to do in 6.\n\nWe avoided the two collisions by:\n  - Avoiding freeway6 at turn8 by not being there (we were at y=5 at turn8) and then being at freeway6 at turn9 (safe) and then at freeway6 again at turn10 (safe).\n  - Then at turn10 we moved to freeway7 at turn11? But we were at freeway6 at turn10, and then we moved to freeway7 at turn11. And freeway7 at turn11 is safe.\n\nBut note: at turn10 we were at freeway6, then we moved to freeway7 at turn11. At turn11, we are at freeway7 -> safe.\n\nThen at turn11 we move to freeway8 at turn12, and at turn12 we are at freeway8 -> safe.\n\nThen we move to y=9.\n\nSo it works.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=6.\n\nBut in the sequence above, we did:\n\n  turn7: S\n  turn8: U -> moves to y=6 at turn9\n  turn9: S -> stays at y=6 at turn10\n  turn10: U -> moves to y=7 at turn11\n  turn11: U -> moves to y=8 at turn12\n  turn12: U -> moves to y=9\n\nWe have 6 actions.\n\nNow, is there a way to do in 5? We need to get to y=9 by turn11 (since 5 actions: turn7 to turn11). We start at y=5. We need 4 net up moves. So 4U and 1S? But we must be at y=9 at the end of turn11.\n\nLet me try:\n\n  turn7: U -> then at turn7: y=5 -> safe. Then at turn8: we are at y=6 -> collision (freeway6 at turn8: car3 at [-3,8] contains 0). -> fails.\n\n  turn7: S -> turn8: y=5 -> safe.\n  turn8: U -> turn9: y=6 -> safe (freeway6 at turn9: safe)\n  turn9: U -> turn10: y=7 -> collision (freeway7 at turn10: car2 at [-11,0] contains 0). -> fails.\n\n  turn7: S\n  turn8: U\n  turn9: U -> blocked as above.\n\n  turn7: D -> turn8: y=4 -> collision on freeway4? car3 at turn8: [-11,0] -> collision.\n\n  turn7: S\n  turn8: S\n  turn9: U -> y=6 at turn10 -> safe\n  turn10: U -> y=7 at turn11 -> safe\n  turn11: U -> y=8 at turn11? Then we are at y=8 at the end of turn11, not y=9. \n          We need one more U to get to y=9 -> so we need 6 actions.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=6.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 7: S\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: S\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\n}\n\nBut note: the problem says \"current turn is t1\" and we are to write for turns starting at t1. And t1=7.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 7: S\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: S\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\n\nWe have 6 lines.\n\nBut wait, the player is at (0,5) at turn7. Then after turn7: S, at the end of turn7, still at (0,5). Then at turn8: U -> then at the end of turn8, at (0,6)? But we are not at (0,6) until turn9? \n\nActually, the update is: \n  y_{t+1} = y_t + \\Delta y_t\n\nSo at turn t, we do action a_t, and then y_{t+1} is the position for the next turn.\n\nBut the collision check is at turn t: we are at y_t.\n\nSo at turn7: we are at y=5. We do action S -> then y_{8} = 5 + 0 = 5. So at the start of turn8, we are at y=5.\n\nAt turn8: we do U -> then y_{9} = 5 + 1 = 6. So at the start of turn9, we are at y=6.\n\nThe sequence of positions:\n  Turn7: y=5\n  Turn8: y=5\n  Turn9: y=6\n  Turn10: y=6  (because we did S at turn9: so y_{10}=6+0=6)\n  Turn11: y=7  (U at turn10: y_{11}=6+1=7)\n  Turn12: y=8  (U at turn11: y_{12}=7+1=8)\n  Turn13: y=9  (U at turn12: y_{13}=8+1=9)\n\nBut we are done at turn13? But we only took actions until turn12. And at the end of turn12, we are at y=8? We need to be at y=9.\n\nThis is a critical point: \n\n  The problem: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" such that after the last action (at turn t1+H-1) we are at (0,9).\n\nBut in our plan, after the last action (turn12) we are at y=8? Then we haven't reached y=9.\n\nWe must have one more action to get to y=9.\n\nSo we need 7 actions? \n\nBut wait, we defined H as the number of turns (actions). And we want to be at y=9 at the end of the last action.\n\nSo we need an action that takes us from y=8 to y=9. That must be an U at the last action.\n\nTherefore, we must be at y=8 at the start of the last turn, then do U to get to y=9.\n\nIn the sequence above, we are at y=8 at the start of turn12? Then we do U at turn12 and then y_{13}=9. But then we are at y=9 at turn13. So we need to include turn13? \n\nBut then H=7: actions at turn7 to turn13.\n\nBut earlier we had a plan that used 6 actions and ended at y=8 at turn12? That is not done.\n\nSo how do we get to y=9 in 6 actions? \n\nWe need to be at y=9 at the end of turn12. That means at the start of turn12 we are at y=8, then we do U at turn12 and then we are at y=9 at the end of turn12.\n\nBut then the last action is at turn12 and we are at y=9.\n\nSo the positions:\n  Turn7: y=5 (start)\n  After action at turn7: y_{8} = 5 + \\Delta -> we want to be at y=9 at the end of the last action (turn12), which is y_{13}? \n\nLet me clarify the timing:\n\n  - At the start of turn t, the player is at y_t.\n  - Then we choose action a_t.\n  - Then the next state: y_{t+1} = y_t + \\Delta y_t (clamped to [0,9]).\n  - During turn t, the player is at y_t (for collision check).\n\nAnd we want after the last action (which is at turn t1+H-1 = 7+H-1) to have y_{t1+H} = 9.\n\nNote: after the action at turn T, the new position is y_{T+1}.\n\nSo if we do the last action at turn12, then we have y_{13} = 9.\n\nBut we are asked to reach (0,9) at the end of the sequence. So y_{t1+H} = 9.\n\nTherefore, the last action is at turn t1+H-1, and then at the next turn (t1+H) we are at y=9.\n\nIn our case, t1=7, so we want y_{7+H} = 9.\n\nWe start at turn7: y_7=5.\n\nThen after H actions (at turns7,8,...,7+H-1), we have y_{7+H} = 9.\n\nThe minimal moves: we need at least 4 up moves. So H must be at least 4? But we have to account for waits.\n\nThe number of up moves must be 4. The other moves can be S or D, but D would be counterproductive.\n\nSo the total number of moves H must be at least 4, but can be more.\n\nIn the plan with 6 actions (H=6): \n  We have: y_{7+6} = y_{13} = 9.\n\nAnd we have 4 U and 2 S? In our previous 6-action plan we had: S, U, S, U, U, U -> that's 4 U and 2 S. \n\nBut in terms of the state:\n\n  y7 = 5\n  After a7 (S): y8 = 5\n  After a8 (U): y9 = 6\n  After a9 (S): y10 = 6\n  After a10 (U): y11 = 7\n  After a11 (U): y12 = 8\n  After a12 (U): y13 = 9\n\nSo yes, we reach y13=9.\n\nAnd we have 6 actions: at turns7,8,9,10,11,12.\n\nSo H=6.\n\nNow, we must ensure that at every turn from 7 to 12, when we are at y_t, it is safe.\n\n  Turn7: y7=5 -> safe (freeway5 at turn7: [-47,-36] -> 0 not in)\n  Turn8: y8=5 -> safe (freeway5 at turn8: [-43,-32] -> safe)\n  Turn9: y9=6 -> safe (freeway6 at turn9: [-39,-28], [37,48], [1,12] -> safe)\n  Turn10: y10=6 -> safe (freeway6 at turn10: [-35,-24], [41,52], [5,16] -> safe)\n  Turn11: y11=7 -> safe (freeway7 at turn11: [49,60], [1,12] -> 0 not in [1,12] because 0<1? So safe)\n  Turn12: y12=8 -> safe (freeway8 at turn12: [61,72], [13,24] -> safe)\n\nAll safe.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 6.\n\nBut can we do with H=5? Then we would have y_{12}=9.\n\nWe start at y7=5. After 5 actions (turns7 to 11), we have y12=9.\n\nWe need to increase by 4. So we must have 4 U and 1 S? Or 4 U and 1 D? But D would reduce. So 4U and 1S.\n\nLet me try:\n\n  We have to avoid freeway6 at turn8 and freeway7 at turn10.\n\n  Option:\n      a7: S -> y8=5 (safe at turn7 and turn8: freeway5)\n      a8: U -> y9=6 (safe at turn9: freeway6 at turn9 is safe)\n      a9: U -> y10=7 (collision at turn10: freeway7 at turn10 has car2 at [-11,0] -> collision)\n\n  Another option:\n      a7: U -> then y8=6 (collision at turn8: freeway6 at turn8 has car3 at [-3,8] -> collision)\n\n  Another option:\n      a7: S\n      a8: S -> y9=5 (safe: freeway5 at turn9: [-39,-28] -> safe)\n      a9: U -> y10=6 (safe: freeway6 at turn10: safe)\n      a10: U -> y11=7 (safe: freeway7 at turn11: safe)\n      a11: U -> y12=8 -> not 9.\n\n  So we need one more U.\n\n  If we do a11: U -> y12=8, then we are not at 9.\n\n  So we cannot reach y12=9 in 5 actions.\n\n  Therefore, minimal H=6.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 7: S\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: S\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\n}\n\nBut note: the problem says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\". Here H=6, so t from 0 to 5.\n\nWe write:\n\nTurn 7: a_{7} = S\nTurn 8: a_{8} = U\nTurn 9: a_{9} = S\nTurn 10: a_{10} = U\nTurn 11: a_{11} = U\nTurn 12: a_{12} = U\n\nBut the turn indices are 7 to 12.\n\nAlternatively, the problem says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" and then \"Turn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1+1}\" ... up to \"Turn t_1 + H - 1\".\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 7: S\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: S\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\n\nThis is correct.\n</think>\nTo reach the position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 5) at turn 7 while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8, the minimal number of turns required is 6. The sequence of actions is designed to avoid collisions at critical points:\n\n- At turn 8, being on freeway y=6 would cause a collision with a car spanning [-3, 8] (which contains 0). Therefore, the player stays at y=5 (freeway 5) for turns 7 and 8.\n- At turn 9, freeway y=6 is safe (cars span [-39, -28], [37, 48], and [1, 12]; 0 is not in any interval).\n- The player stays at y=6 during turn 10 to avoid being on freeway y=7 at turn 10, where a car spans [-11, 0] (containing 0).\n- By turn 11, freeway y=7 is safe (cars span [49, 60] and [1, 12]; 0 not in [1, 12]).\n- Freeway y=8 is safe at turn 12 (cars span [61, 72] and [13, 24]; 0 not in either).\n\nThe sequence of actions ensures the player moves from y=5 to y=9 in 6 turns (H=6) without any collisions:\n\n- Turn 7: Stay (S) at y=5 (safe, freeway 5: [-47, -36]).\n- Turn 8: Move up (U) to y=6 at turn 9 (safe at turn 8: freeway 5: [-43, -32]).\n- Turn 9: Stay (S) at y=6 (safe, freeway 6: [-39, -28], [37, 48], [1, 12]).\n- Turn 10: Move up (U) to y=7 at turn 11 (safe at turn 10: freeway 6: [-35, -24], [41, 52], [5, 16]).\n- Turn 11: Move up (U) to y=8 at turn 12 (safe, freeway 7: [49, 60], [1, 12]).\n- Turn 12: Move up (U) to y=9 at turn 13 (safe at turn 12: freeway 8: [61, 72], [13, 24]).\n\nAfter turn 12, the player reaches (0, 9) at turn 13.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 7: S \\\\\nTurn 8: U \\\\\nTurn 9: S \\\\\nTurn 10: U \\\\\nTurn 11: U \\\\\nTurn 12: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are given the current turn t1 = 9, and the player is at (0,6). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to 8.\n\nThe player can move up (U: +1), down (D: -1), or stay (S: 0) in the y-direction. The y-coordinate is bounded between 0 and 9.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if the player is on a freeway k (where k is the y-coordinate at that turn) and at that same turn T, there is a car on freeway k such that 0 (the x-coordinate of the player) is in the span of that car.\n\nImportant: When moving from y_T to y_{T+1} at turn T, the player is considered to be on freeway y_T at turn T, and then moves to y_{T+1} at the next turn. So if at turn T the player is at y_T = k, then we check the cars on freeway k at turn T. If the player moves to k+1 at turn T, then at turn T the player is still on k, and at turn T+1 the player will be on k+1.\n\nThe goal is to get to y=9 (which is the top, and note that there are no cars on y=9 because the freeways are only from 1 to 8). So once we reach y=9, we are safe.\n\nWe start at y=6 at turn 9.\n\nWe need to simulate the movement of the cars as well. The cars move continuously with their speeds. The update for a car at turn T (relative to the initial turn t1=9) is:\n\nFor a left-moving car (d = left): \n  At turn t1 + t, the car's span is [h - s*t, τ - s*t]   (note: in the problem, for left-moving, the initial head h is at t1, and then it moves left so the head becomes h - s*t and tail τ - s*t)\n\nBut note: the problem states for left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] -> Span(T) = [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving: [τ, h] -> [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nHowever, note the representation in the table:\n\nFor freeway 1: \n  (36,25,right,12): right-moving, so at t1=9, the car is from 25 to 36? But the representation says (head, tail, direction, speed). \n\nBut the problem says for right-moving: the span at t1 is [τ, h]? Actually, the problem says for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\". So in the input, the first number is the head and the second is the tail? But for right-moving, the head is the front which is the larger x? Actually, the problem doesn't specify which is front, but the update rule tells us.\n\nLet me clarify the representation:\n\nIn the table, for a car we have: (head, tail, direction, speed)\n\nFor a right-moving car: the head is the front (the leading part) and the tail is the rear. So at t1, the car is from tail to head? But the update rule says: for right-moving, the span at t1 is [τ, h] meaning from τ to h? Then that implies that in the tuple (head, tail), the head is the larger value? \n\nBut look at freeway 2: (0, -47, right, 48). Then at t1=9, the car is from -47 to 0? So the head is 0 and the tail is -47.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving: freeway 3: (-24,-1,left,24). Then the span at t1 is [h, τ] = [-24, -1]? So the head is -24 and the tail is -1? But that would mean the car is from -24 to -1? Then as time goes, the car moves left: so the head becomes -24 - 24*t and the tail becomes -1 -24*t.\n\nHowever, note that the problem says for left-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, τ]\". So in the tuple, the first number is the head and the second is the tail, and the car is from head to tail? But then if head=-24 and tail=-1, then the car is from -24 to -1? But that would be a car of length 23? Then when moving left, the entire segment moves left.\n\nBut wait: the problem says the car span is [head, tail] for left-moving? Actually, the problem says: \"left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ]\". Then the update: [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]. So the entire interval shifts left by s*(T-t1).\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving: the span is [τ, h] at t1, and then becomes [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n\nSo in the input:\n\nFor a car (h, τ, d, s):\n  if d == 'left': the car occupies the interval [min(h,τ), max(h,τ)]? Actually, not necessarily: because the head might be less than the tail? \n\nBut in the example for freeway 3: (-24, -1, left, 24). The head is -24 and tail is -1. Since it's left-moving, the head should be the leftmost? Actually, no: the head is defined as the front. For a left-moving car, the front is the leftmost? So the head is the leftmost and the tail is the rightmost? Then the car is from h to τ (with h <= τ). Then the car is from -24 to -1? That is 24 units long? But then the update: at time T, it becomes [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)] = [-24 -24*(T-9), -1 -24*(T-9)]. \n\nSimilarly, for a right-moving car: the head is the rightmost and the tail is the leftmost? So the car is from τ (left) to h (right). Then the update: [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n\nBut in the input for freeway 1: (36,25,right,12): so head=36, tail=25. Then the car is from 25 to 36? Then at T, it becomes [25+12*(T-9), 36+12*(T-9)].\n\nAnother example: freeway 2: (0,-47,right,48): car from -47 to 0? Then at T, becomes [-47+48*(T-9), 0+48*(T-9)].\n\nNow, collision: at turn T, if the player is at (0, k) and on freeway k, then we check if 0 is in any car's span on freeway k at that turn T.\n\nWe are to plan from turn 9 (current) to the turn when we reach y=9.\n\nWe start at turn 9 at y=6.\n\nWe need to simulate the cars for each freeway for each future turn.\n\nSince we are minimizing the number of turns, we try to go up as fast as possible, but we must avoid collisions.\n\nWe can consider moving up (U), down (D), or staying (S) at each step.\n\nWe note that the player can only change by one unit per turn.\n\nWe are to output the sequence of actions starting at turn t1=9.\n\nThe answer should be in the format:\n\nTurn 9: a_9\nTurn 10: a_10\n...\n\nuntil the turn when we first reach y=9.\n\nLet me denote the state as (turn, y). We start at (9,6).\n\nWe wish to reach (T,9) for the smallest T>=9.\n\nWe can do a BFS over the states (turn, y) and check for collisions.\n\nBut the turn can be large? However, the cars move linearly and the player only has 3 moves per turn, and the grid in y is only 10 states (0..9). But the cars: we have to compute their positions at each turn.\n\nNote: the cars' positions are linear functions of time. So we can compute for any turn T the exact position of the car.\n\nHowever, we must avoid collisions at every turn when the player is on a freeway (y from 1 to 8).\n\nWe can simulate turn by turn, starting from turn 9.\n\nWe note that the player must not be on a freeway k at turn T if there is a car on freeway k at turn T that has 0 in its span.\n\nWe are going to simulate until we reach y=9.\n\nWe'll try to move up as much as possible, but if we see that moving up would cause a collision in the next step (when we are on that freeway at that turn) then we might have to wait or go down.\n\nBut note: we can also go down to avoid, but then we have to come back up, which might take more turns.\n\nWe are minimizing the total number of turns, so we want the shortest path.\n\nWe can use BFS in the state space: state = (t, y) where t is the current turn (starting at 9) and y in [0,9]. The goal is y=9.\n\nThe actions: U, D, S. Then next state: (t+1, y + dy) with dy = +1 for U, -1 for D, 0 for S, but clamped to [0,9]. However, note that the problem says \"y_{t+1} \\in [0,9]\", so if we are at 0 and choose D, we stay at 0? Similarly, at 9 and choose U, we stay at 9? But the problem says: \"y_{t+1} \\in [0,9]\" and the update is applied then clamped? Actually, the problem does not explicitly say clamping, but it says y_{t+1} must be in [0,9]. So we assume that if the move would take it out of bounds, it stays.\n\nBut note: the problem says: \"y_{t+1} = y_t + \\Delta y_t\", and then \"y_{t+1} \\in [0,9]\". So we must clamp. For example, at y=0 and a_t=D: then y_{t+1} = -1 -> but then we set to 0? Or is the move invalid? The problem says \"y_{t+1} \\in [0,9]\", so we clamp.\n\nSo:\n  if y_t + \\Delta y_t < 0, then y_{t+1}=0\n  if y_t + \\Delta y_t > 9, then y_{t+1}=9\n  else y_{t+1} = y_t + \\Delta y_t\n\nBut note: we are at y=6 at turn 9. We want to get to y=9. The minimal moves without any cars would be 3 moves: U, U, U. But we have to avoid cars.\n\nWe must check for each turn T and each freeway k (if we are on that freeway at that turn) whether the car on that freeway (if any) has 0 in their span.\n\nWe are given the cars per freeway at turn t1=9.\n\nWe need to compute for each freeway k (1..8) and for each future turn T (>=9) the set of x-coordinates that are occupied by cars on that freeway at turn T.\n\nBut note: we only care about the player's x=0.\n\nSo for a given freeway k and turn T, we check: is there a car on freeway k at turn T such that 0 is in [L, R] (the span of the car)?\n\nWe can precompute for each freeway k and for each car on k, the intervals of time when the car covers x=0? Actually, we can compute the exact condition.\n\nBut note: the cars move continuously, so at a fixed turn T, the car's span is fixed.\n\nFor a car on freeway k:\n\n  If it is right-moving: the span at turn T is [τ + s*(T-9), h + s*(T-9)].\n  Then 0 is in [τ + s*(T-9), h + s*(T-9)] if and only if:\n      τ + s*(T-9) <= 0 <= h + s*(T-9)\n\n  Similarly, for left-moving:\n      h - s*(T-9) <= 0 <= τ - s*(T-9)\n\nBut note: for left-moving, the span is [h - s*(T-9), τ - s*(T-9)]. Then the condition is:\n      h - s*(T-9) <= 0 <= τ - s*(T-9)\n\nBut wait: for left-moving, the head h is the leftmost at t1? Actually, the problem states: for left-moving, the span at t1 is [h, τ] (so h is the left end, τ is the right end). Then at T, the left end is h - s*(T-9) and the right end is τ - s*(T-9). So the condition is:\n      h - s*(T-9) <= 0 <= τ - s*(T-9)\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving: the span at t1 is [τ, h] (so τ is the left end, h is the right end). Then at T, the left end is τ + s*(T-9) and the right end is h + s*(T-9). Condition:\n      τ + s*(T-9) <= 0 <= h + s*(T-9)\n\nBut note: in the right-moving case, we have τ <= h? In the input, for right-moving: (head, tail) = (h, τ) and then the span is [τ, h] so τ should be <= h? \n\nCheck freeway 1: (36,25,right,12): then τ=25, h=36 -> 25<=36, so condition: 25 + 12*(T-9) <= 0 <= 36 + 12*(T-9). But 25+12*(T-9) is always positive for T>=9? So 0 is never in this interval? \n\nSimilarly, freeway 1 has another car: (-12,-23,right,12): so τ=-23, h=-12 -> then condition: -23 + 12*(T-9) <= 0 <= -12 + 12*(T-9)\n\nSolve: \n   -23 + 12*(T-9) <= 0  => 12*(T-9) <= 23 => T-9 <= 23/12 ≈ 1.916 => T <= 10.916 -> so T=10 and T=11? \n   and 0 <= -12 + 12*(T-9) => 12*(T-9) >= 12 => T-9>=1 => T>=10.\n\nSo together: T>=10 and T<=10.916 -> so T=10? Because T is integer? Then at T=10, we have:\n   -23 + 12*(1) = -23+12 = -11 <=0 -> true\n   -12 + 12 = 0 <=0 -> true? (but note: the interval is [left, right] and 0 is included if the endpoints are included? The problem says \"0 in the span\", so if the interval is closed? Yes, because the update gives closed intervals.\n\nSo at T=10, the car covers x=0? \n\nBut wait: the condition is: \n   left = τ + s*(T-9) = -23 + 12*(1) = -11\n   right = h + s*(T-9) = -12 + 12 = 0\n\nSo the span is [-11, 0]. Then 0 is included? Yes.\n\nSo at T=10, freeway 1 has a car that covers x=0.\n\nSimilarly, we can compute for every freeway and every car.\n\nBut note: a freeway may have multiple cars. We only need to know if at least one car covers x=0 at turn T.\n\nWe can precompute for each freeway k (1..8) and for each car on k, the set of turns T (>=9) for which the car covers x=0.\n\nAlternatively, we can compute for each freeway k a set of \"danger\" turns: the turns T at which there is at least one car on freeway k that covers x=0.\n\nThen during the simulation, when we are at (t, y) and we are about to be on freeway y at turn t, if y is between 1 and 8, then we check if t is a danger turn for freeway y? Then we cannot be there.\n\nBut note: if we are at y=0 or y=9, then we are not on a freeway (the freeways are y=1..8), so no collision check.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Precomputation: for each freeway k (1..8) and each car on that freeway, compute the time intervals (if any) when the car covers x=0. Then the danger turns for freeway k are the integer T in those intervals.\n\nBut note: the car might cover x=0 for a continuous interval of real time, but we only check at integer turns.\n\nSo for a car, we can compute the integer turns T>=9 for which the condition holds.\n\nWe'll do:\n\nFor each freeway k, we'll have a set (or a list) of danger turns.\n\nBut note: the danger set for a freeway k is the union over its cars.\n\nWe can also note that the danger condition for a car is linear in T, so the set of T for which the car covers 0 is an interval (possibly empty) of integers.\n\nLet me compute for each car:\n\nRight-moving car: (h, τ, d='right', s)\nCondition: τ + s*(T-9) <= 0 <= h + s*(T-9)\n\nThis is equivalent to:\n   τ + s*(T-9) <= 0   => T-9 >= ceil(-τ/s) ? Actually, we have to solve the inequalities.\n\nBut note: we are solving for integer T.\n\nWe can write:\n   T-9 >= ceil( ( -h ) / s )   ??? Let me rearrange:\n\nWe have:\n   τ + s*(T-9) <= 0   => s*(T-9) <= -τ   => T-9 <= floor(-τ / s)   ??? Wait, no:\n\nActually, we have:\n   τ + s*(T-9) <= 0   => s*(T-9) <= -τ   => T-9 <= (-τ) / s\n\nBut note: if s>0, then dividing by positive s.\n\nBut we have two inequalities:\n\n   (1) τ + s*(T-9) <= 0\n   (2) 0 <= h + s*(T-9)   => h + s*(T-9) >= 0   => s*(T-9) >= -h   => T-9 >= ceil(-h / s)   [if we are using real numbers, but for integers: T-9 >= ceil(-h/s) ]\n\nBut (1): τ + s*(T-9) <= 0 => s*(T-9) <= -τ => T-9 <= floor((-τ) / s)   [because if we have s*(T-9) <= -τ, then T-9 must be <= floor((-τ)/s) ?]\n\nActually, we can compute the integer T satisfying:\n\n   T-9 >= ceil( (-h) / s )   and   T-9 <= floor( (-τ) / s )\n\nBut note: the inequality (2): h + s*(T-9) >= 0  => s*(T-9) >= -h => T-9 >= ceil(-h/s)   [if we are using real numbers, then the smallest integer T-9 that satisfies is ceil(-h/s)].\n\nSimilarly, (1): τ + s*(T-9) <= 0 => s*(T-9) <= -τ => T-9 <= floor(-τ/s)   [because the largest integer that is <= (-τ)/s is floor(-τ/s)].\n\nSo the integer T must satisfy:\n   ceil( (-h) / s ) <= T-9 <= floor( (-τ) / s )\n\nBut note: h and τ can be negative or positive.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving car: (h, τ, 'left', s)\nCondition: h - s*(T-9) <= 0 <= τ - s*(T-9)\n\nWhich is:\n   0 >= h - s*(T-9)   => s*(T-9) >= h   => T-9 >= ceil(h/s)\n   and 0 <= τ - s*(T-9)   => s*(T-9) <= τ   => T-9 <= floor(τ/s)\n\nSo: T-9 in [ceil(h/s), floor(τ/s)]\n\nBut note: for the left-moving, the head h and tail τ: in the example freeway 3: (-24,-1,left,24): \n   T-9 in [ceil(-24/24), floor(-1/24)] = [ceil(-1), floor(-0.0416)] = [-1, -1]? But that's not possible because T>=9 -> T-9>=0.\n\nLet me check the condition: \n   h - s*(T-9) <= 0 -> -24 - 24*(T-9) <= 0 -> -24 <= 24*(T-9) -> T-9 >= -1 -> which is always true for T>=9.\n   and 0 <= τ - s*(T-9) -> 0 <= -1 -24*(T-9) -> 24*(T-9) <= -1 -> T-9 <= -1/24 -> T-9 <= -0.0416 -> which is impossible for T>=9.\n\nSo this car never covers x=0? That makes sense because the car is at [-24,-1] at T=9 and moves left, so it goes to more negative, so 0 is never covered.\n\nSo we can compute for each car the interval for T-9: [L, R] (if L<=R) then the danger turns for that car are T = 9 + k, for k = L, L+1, ..., R.\n\nThen for a freeway, the danger turns are the union of the danger turns from all its cars.\n\nWe'll do that for each freeway.\n\nLet me do it for each freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: two cars: (36,25,right,12) and (-12,-23,right,12)\n\nCar1: right-moving: h=36, τ=25, s=12.\n   T-9 in [ceil(-36/12), floor(-25/12)] = [ceil(-3), floor(-2.083)] = [-3, -3]? -> but T-9>=0 -> no integer T in [0, ...) satisfies? So no danger from this car.\n\nCar2: (-12,-23,right,12): h=-12, τ=-23, s=12.\n   T-9 in [ceil(-(-12)/12), floor(-(-23)/12)] = [ceil(12/12), floor(23/12)] = [ceil(1), floor(1.916)] = [1, 1] -> so T-9=1 -> T=10.\n\nSo freeway 1: danger at T=10.\n\nFreeway 2: one car: (0,-47,right,48)\n   h=0, τ=-47, s=48.\n   T-9 in [ceil(-0/48), floor(-(-47)/48)] = [ceil(0), floor(47/48)] = [0, 0]? because 47/48<1 -> floor(47/48)=0.\n   So T-9=0 -> T=9.\n\nSo at turn 9, freeway 2 has a car covering x=0? \n\nCheck: at T=9: the car is [τ, h] = [-47,0]. So 0 is in [-47,0]? Yes, at the endpoint.\n\nSo freeway 2: danger at T=9.\n\nFreeway 3: (-24,-1,left,24): \n   T-9 in [ceil(-24/24), floor(-1/24)]? Wait, for left-moving we have the formula: [ceil(h/s), floor(τ/s)] = [ceil(-24/24), floor(-1/24)] = [ceil(-1), floor(-0.0416)] = [-1, -1] -> no danger for T>=9.\n\nFreeway 4: three cars: \n  (60,49,right,12): h=60, τ=49 -> T-9 in [ceil(-60/12), floor(-49/12)] = [ceil(-5), floor(-4.083)] = [-5,-5] -> no danger.\n  (-24,-35,right,12): h=-24, τ=-35 -> T-9 in [ceil(24/12), floor(35/12)] = [ceil(2), floor(2.916)] = [2,2] -> T=9+2=11.\n  (12,1,right,12): h=12, τ=1 -> T-9 in [ceil(-12/12), floor(-1/12)] = [ceil(-1), floor(-0.083)] = [-1,-1] -> no.\n\nSo freeway 4: danger at T=11.\n\nFreeway 5: (-28,-39,right,4): \n   h=-28, τ=-39 -> T-9 in [ceil(28/4), floor(39/4)] = [ceil(7), floor(9.75)] = [7,9] -> so T=9+7=16, 17, 18, 19? (from 7 to 9 inclusive: 7,8,9 -> T=16,17,18)\n\nBut wait: the formula: T-9 in [ceil( (-h)/s ), floor( (-τ)/s )] = [ceil(28/4), floor(39/4)] = [ceil(7), floor(9.75)] = [7,9]. So T=9+7=16, 17, 18? (since 9+9=18)\n\nSo freeway 5: danger at T=16,17,18.\n\nFreeway 6: three cars:\n  (-28,-39,right,4): same as freeway5? -> T=16,17,18.\n  (48,37,right,4): h=48, τ=37 -> T-9 in [ceil(-48/4), floor(-37/4)] = [ceil(-12), floor(-9.25)] = [-12,-10] -> no (T>=9).\n  (12,1,right,4): h=12, τ=1 -> T-9 in [ceil(-12/4), floor(-1/4)] = [ceil(-3), floor(-0.25)] = [-3,-1] -> no.\n\nSo freeway 6: danger at T=16,17,18.\n\nFreeway 7: two cars: (36,25,right,12) and (-12,-23,right,12) -> same as freeway1: so danger at T=10.\n\nFreeway 8: same as freeway1: danger at T=10.\n\nSummary of danger turns per freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: {10}\nFreeway 2: {9}\nFreeway 3: {}\nFreeway 4: {11}\nFreeway 5: {16,17,18}\nFreeway 6: {16,17,18}\nFreeway 7: {10}\nFreeway 8: {10}\n\nNow, we simulate from turn 9, starting at y=6.\n\nWe wish to get to y=9 as quickly as possible.\n\nWe'll use BFS (or Dijkstra, but all moves cost 1) to find the shortest path.\n\nState: (turn, y)\n\nWe start at (9,6). \n\nAt a state (t,y), we consider actions: U, D, S.\n\nThen next state: (t+1, y') where y' = min(9, max(0, y + dy)) with dy: +1 for U, -1 for D, 0 for S.\n\nBut then we must check: if the next state (t+1, y') is safe? Actually, no: we must check at the next turn t+1, when the player is at y', if y' is in [1,8] (so a freeway) then we must check that at turn t+1, freeway y' is not dangerous? i.e., t+1 is not in the danger set for freeway y'.\n\nBut note: at the current turn t, we are at y. We choose an action at turn t. Then at turn t, we are at y (and we have already been safe at turn t, because we are at that state). Then we move to (t+1, y').\n\nSo when we are at (t,y), we assume we are safe at turn t (if y in [1,8] then t is not in the danger set for y?).\n\nBut when we start at (9,6): we must check if at turn 9, freeway 6 is dangerous? \n\nFrom above, freeway 6: danger at T=16,17,18 -> so at T=9, freeway6 is safe.\n\nBut we also have freeway2: danger at T=9, but we are not on freeway2 at turn9, we are on freeway6.\n\nSo the state (t,y) must satisfy: if y in [1,8], then t is not in the danger set for freeway y.\n\nWe start at (9,6): 6 in [1,8] -> check freeway6: danger set {16,17,18} -> 9 not in there -> safe.\n\nNow, from (9,6), we can choose U, D, S.\n\nIf we choose U: then next y' = min(9,6+1)=7. Then next state (10,7). Now, we must check: at turn10, freeway7 is dangerous? freeway7: danger set {10} -> yes! So if we go to (10,7), we are on freeway7 at turn10 -> collision.\n\nSo we cannot do U at turn9.\n\nIf we choose D: then y' = max(0,6-1)=5. Then state (10,5). Check freeway5 at turn10: danger set {16,17,18} -> 10 not in -> safe.\n\nIf we choose S: then y'=6. Then state (10,6). Check freeway6 at turn10: safe (since danger at 16,17,18).\n\nSo from (9,6): we can go to (10,5) or (10,6) but not (10,7).\n\nWe then continue.\n\nWe want the minimal H such that we reach y=9.\n\nWe can use BFS (since all moves cost 1 and we want the minimal number of turns).\n\nWe'll keep a visited set for states (t,y) to avoid cycles? But note: we can go down and then up, and the turn is increasing, so we don't have cycles in the strict sense? But we might get to the same y at a later turn? But since we are minimizing the number of turns, we want the earliest time we get to y=9. So we can use a BFS that expands by turn.\n\nWe'll use a queue: each state is (t, y, path) but the path might be long. Alternatively, we can store the parent pointers, or we can store the minimal steps and then reconstruct.\n\nBut note: the state space: t can go up to ...? but we know the minimal turns is at least 3 (if we go up 3 times) but might be more. The danger turns are up to 18, so we don't need to go too far.\n\nWe'll simulate until we reach y=9.\n\nWe'll do:\n\nLet dist[t][y] = minimal number of steps (turns) from start to reach (t,y). But we start at (9,6) and we count the number of actions? Actually, the problem: we start at turn9, and we take actions at turn9, turn10, ... until we reach y=9 at some turn T.\n\nThe total turns H is the number of actions? Actually, the problem says: we take H actions: from t1 to t1+H-1. Then at turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9). So H is the number of actions.\n\nWe start at turn9, and we take an action at turn9, then at turn10, ... until we are at y=9.\n\nSo we want the sequence of actions from turn9 until the turn we first get to y=9.\n\nWe'll do BFS in the state (t,y) and the time t is increasing.\n\nWe start at (9,6) with 0 actions taken? But we are at turn9 and we haven't taken an action for that turn? Actually, we are about to take the first action at turn9.\n\nBut note: the state at turn9 is the starting position. Then we take an action at turn9 to move to turn10.\n\nSo we can consider the state (t,y) meaning that at the beginning of turn t, we are at y. Then we choose an action a_t, and then at the end of the turn (or at the next turn) we are at y_{t} (but actually, the move happens and then we are at the next turn).\n\nBut the problem: after taking an action at turn t, we are at the next state at turn t+1.\n\nSo the state (t,y) is the state at the start of turn t: we are at y. Then we choose a_t, which determines y_{t+1}. Then we are at (t+1, y_{t+1]).\n\nBut we are given that at turn9, we are at (0,6). So we start at state (9,6). Then we take action a9 to get to (10, y10).\n\nSo we don't have to check the state (9,6) for collision? Actually, we are at freeway6 at turn9: we already checked that it is safe.\n\nSo algorithm:\n\nLet Q be a queue. We start with state (9,6) and path [].\n\nWe mark visited[state] = (t,y) to avoid processing the same state again? But we might have different paths to the same (t,y) and we want the minimal H. Since we are doing BFS by t, the first time we reach (t,y) we have the minimal t. But note: we are minimizing the total turns (which is H = T - 9 + 1? Actually, the number of actions H = T - 9 + 1, because we take an action at turn9, then at turn10, ... until turn T (the last action). Then we are at turn T at y=9. So we want the minimal T (then H = T-9+1).\n\nBut actually, we want the minimal H? Or the minimal T? The problem says: minimal number of turns H. And then we output the sequence of H actions.\n\nNote: we start at turn9. After H actions, we are at turn9+H-1. And we require that at turn9+H-1, we are at y=9.\n\nSo we want the minimal H such that we can get from (9,6) to (9+H-1,9).\n\nWe can do BFS by the number of actions.\n\nWe'll do:\n\n  states: (t, y) where t is the current turn (the next action will be taken at turn t, and we are at y at the beginning of turn t).\n\n  We start at (9,6) with H=0? But we haven't taken any actions. We will take H actions.\n\n  We want to find a path to a state (t,9) for the smallest H = t - 9 + 1? Actually, if we are at state (t,9) then we have taken (t-9) actions? \n\n  How: \n      At turn9: we start at (9,6). Then we take an action a9 -> we get to (10, y10). Then we have taken 1 action.\n      After k actions: we are at turn9+k, and we are at y_{9+k}.\n\n  We want to be at y=9 at turn T = 9 + (H-1). Why? Because we take H actions: the first at turn9, the last at turn9+H-1. Then at the end of the last action, we are at turn T = 9+H-1 and we must be at y=9.\n\n  So we are looking for a state (T,9) with T as small as possible (>=9) and then H = T-9+1.\n\n  Therefore, we can do BFS until we find the smallest T such that we can be at (T,9) and we were safe at every step.\n\n  We start at (9,6). Then we consider actions: that will lead to (10, y10). Then from (10,y10) we consider actions to (11,y11), etc.\n\n  We mark a state (t,y) as visited to avoid revisiting with a larger or equal t? But if we get to (t,y) with a larger t, it might be necessary if we avoid a future collision? However, since we are looking for the minimal T, we can break when we first get to (T,9). But note: we might get to (T,9) at the same T by different paths? Then we take the first one.\n\n  However, we must avoid states that we have already visited at the same (t,y) with a larger number of actions? But we are doing BFS by t (which is the same as by the number of actions: t = 9 + number_of_actions_taken). So the first time we get to (t,y) is the minimal number of actions to get there.\n\n  So we can use:\n\n      visited = dictionary: key (t,y) -> we mark it once we visit.\n\n  Steps:\n\n      queue = deque()\n      start: (9,6) -> and we haven't taken any action yet? Actually, we are at the beginning of turn9.\n\n      We will generate next states by applying an action at turn9.\n\n      We mark (9,6) as visited.\n\n      Then for each action in [U, D, S]:\n          next_y = clamp(y + dy)\n          next_t = 10\n          Then we check: if next_y is in [1,8], then we must check that at turn10, freeway next_y is not dangerous? \n          But note: at the next state, we are at (10, next_y). Then we will be on freeway next_y at turn10. So we check: if next_y in [1,8] and 10 is in the danger set for freeway next_y, then skip.\n\n          Also, if next_y is 0 or 9, no check.\n\n      Then if we haven't visited (10, next_y), we enqueue it and record the action.\n\n      We continue until we get to a state (T,9) for any T. Then we stop and output the sequence.\n\n  But note: we might get to (T,9) and then we output the sequence of actions that led to it.\n\n  However, we must record the path. We can store for each state (t,y) the action that we took at the previous state to get here, and the previous state.\n\n  Alternatively, we store the entire path from the start.\n\n  Since H is small, we can store the path.\n\n  We'll store: (t, y, path) where path is the list of actions taken so far (from turn9 to turn t-1). Then at state (t,y), the next action we take at turn t will be appended.\n\n  But note: at state (9,6): we are about to take an action at turn9. Then we take a9 and go to (10, next_y). Then the path for (10, next_y) is [a9].\n\n  Then from (10, next_y), we take a10 and go to (11, next_y2), and the path becomes [a9, a10].\n\n  We stop when we reach a state (T, next_y) such that next_y==9.\n\n  Then the sequence of actions is the path.\n\n  The minimal H is the length of the path.\n\n  We do BFS so the first time we hit y=9 we have the minimal T (and hence minimal H).\n\nLet me simulate:\n\nStart: (9,6) -> path=[].\n\nActions:\n\n  U: next_y = 7 -> then state (10,7). But freeway7 at turn10: danger? yes (T=10 is in danger set) -> skip.\n\n  D: next_y = 5 -> state (10,5). Check: freeway5 at turn10: danger? {16,17,18} -> no. So we enqueue (10,5, ['D']).\n\n  S: next_y = 6 -> state (10,6). Check: freeway6 at turn10: safe. Enqueue (10,6, ['S']).\n\nNow from (10,5) (path=['D']):\n\n  Actions at turn10:\n\n    U: next_y = 6 -> state (11,6). Check: freeway6 at turn11: safe? (danger at 16,17,18) -> yes, safe. Enqueue (11,6, ['D','U']).\n\n    D: next_y = 4 -> state (11,4). Check: freeway4 at turn11: danger? freeway4: danger at T=11 -> yes! So skip.\n\n    S: next_y=5 -> state (11,5). Check: freeway5 at turn11: safe. Enqueue (11,5, ['D','S']).\n\nFrom (10,6) (path=['S']):\n\n  Actions:\n\n    U: next_y=7 -> state (11,7). Check: freeway7 at turn11: danger set {10} -> 11 not in -> safe. Enqueue (11,7, ['S','U']).\n\n    D: next_y=5 -> state (11,5). Check: freeway5 at turn11: safe. Enqueue (11,5, ['S','D']) but we already have (11,5) from the other branch? But we can have multiple paths to same state? But BFS by time: we are at the same time and same state? We mark visited by (t,y). So we should not enqueue (11,5) twice? We mark (11,5) as visited when we first get there.\n\n    S: next_y=6 -> state (11,6). Check: safe. Enqueue (11,6, ['S','S']).\n\nBut note: we already have (11,6) from the first branch? So we only enqueue if we haven't visited (t,y) before.\n\nNow, we continue:\n\nWe have:\n\n  (10,5): done, expanded.\n\n  (10,6): done, expanded.\n\nNow we have states at t=11: (11,6) from two paths: one ['D','U'] and one ['S','S']? But we only need one? We take the first one we get to (11,6) and mark it visited.\n\nWe'll process in order of t.\n\nSo next: the states at t=11: we have (11,5), (11,7), (11,6) [we only enqueue the first time we get to (11,y)].\n\nLet me list the queue:\n\n  After t=10: we have (10,5) and (10,6). We process (10,5) and then (10,6).\n\n  Then from (10,5): we generate (11,6) and (11,5). Then mark (10,5) done.\n\n  Then from (10,6): we generate (11,7) and (11,5) and (11,6). But (11,5) and (11,6) are already generated? So we only enqueue (11,7) and skip the others if we mark visited.\n\nWe'll do:\n\n  We use a queue and a visited set. We mark (t,y) as visited.\n\n  When we generate (next_t, next_y), if we haven't visited it, we enqueue.\n\nSo:\n\n  Start: enqueue (9,6, []) and mark visited(9,6)=True.\n\n  Then:\n\n      pop (9,6): \n          U: (10,7) -> danger? yes -> skip.\n          D: (10,5) -> not visited -> enqueue with ['D'], mark visited(10,5)=True.\n          S: (10,6) -> not visited -> enqueue with ['S'], mark visited(10,6)=True.\n\n      pop (10,5): \n          U: (11,6) -> not visited? -> enqueue with ['D','U'], mark visited(11,6)=True.\n          D: (11,4) -> danger at freeway4 at turn11? yes (freeway4: T=11) -> skip.\n          S: (11,5) -> not visited -> enqueue with ['D','S'], mark visited(11,5)=True.\n\n      pop (10,6):\n          U: (11,7) -> not visited -> enqueue with ['S','U'], mark visited(11,7)=True.\n          D: (11,5) -> visited? already from (10,5) we have (11,5) -> skip.\n          S: (11,6) -> visited? already from (10,5) we have (11,6) -> skip.\n\n      Now queue: (11,6) with ['D','U'], (11,5) with ['D','S'], (11,7) with ['S','U'].\n\n      Now pop (11,6): \n          We are at (11,6). We want to get to y=9? not yet.\n          Actions:\n            U: (12,7) -> check freeway7 at turn12: danger set {10} -> safe. Enqueue (12,7, ['D','U','U']) -> mark visited(12,7).\n            D: (12,5) -> freeway5 at turn12: safe? danger at 16,17,18 -> safe. Enqueue (12,5, ['D','U','D']).\n            S: (12,6) -> freeway6 at turn12: safe. Enqueue (12,6, ['D','U','S']).\n\n      Pop (11,5): \n          Actions:\n            U: (12,6) -> visited? no -> enqueue (12,6, ['D','S','U']) -> but we already have (12,6) from above? but we mark visited per state, so we skip if we have already (12,6) in the queue? Actually, we mark when we enqueue. But we haven't enqueued (12,6) for this path? We have from (11,6) we enqueued (12,6). So when we generate (12,6) from (11,5) we see that we have not visited (12,6) yet? Actually, we enqueued (12,6) from (11,6) and marked it visited? Then when we process (11,5) we generate (12,6) and see it's visited? So skip.\n\n            D: (12,4) -> freeway4 at turn12: danger set {11} -> 12 not in -> safe. Enqueue (12,4, ['D','S','D']) -> mark visited(12,4).\n            S: (12,5) -> freeway5: safe. Enqueue (12,5, ['D','S','S']) -> but we have (12,5) from (11,6) with action D? -> mark visited(12,5) when we enqueue? Then we skip.\n\n      Pop (11,7): \n          Actions:\n            U: (12,8) -> freeway8 at turn12: danger set {10} -> safe. Enqueue (12,8, ['S','U','U'])\n            D: (12,6) -> visited -> skip.\n            S: (12,7) -> freeway7: safe. Enqueue (12,7, ['S','U','S']) -> but we already have (12,7) from (11,6) with action U? Then skip.\n\n      Now we have states at t=12: (12,7), (12,5), (12,6), (12,4), (12,8), (12,5) [but the last one skipped].\n\n      Now we continue until we get to y=9.\n\n      We are at (12,8): \n          Then actions at turn12:\n            U: (13,9) -> we are at y=9 -> goal! \n            So we found a path: ['S','U','U','U']? \n            But wait: the path for (12,8) is ['S','U','U']? Then we take U at turn12 to get to (13,9). So the entire path: \n                turn9: S\n                turn10: U\n                turn11: U\n                turn12: U\n            Then at turn13 we are at y=9.\n\n            So the actions: \n                Turn9: S\n                Turn10: U\n                Turn11: U\n                Turn12: U\n\n            Then we are at (13,9). So H = 4 actions.\n\n      But is that minimal? We started at turn9, and after 4 actions, we are at turn12? \n          Action0 (turn9): S -> state (10,6)\n          Action1 (turn10): U -> state (11,7)\n          Action2 (turn11): U -> state (12,8)\n          Action3 (turn12): U -> state (13,9)\n\n      So 4 actions.\n\n      But we also had a path that went down to 5 and then up? That might be longer.\n\n      However, is there a path with 3 actions? \n          We start at (9,6). We want to get to (12,9) in 3 actions: \n            turn9: action -> to (10,y1)\n            turn10: action -> to (11,y2)\n            turn11: action -> to (12,y3) and we want y3=9.\n\n          Then we need to go from 6 to 9 in 3 moves: that requires 3 ups: U,U,U.\n\n          But at turn9: we tried U -> to (10,7) -> collision? yes (freeway7 at turn10 is dangerous). So we cannot do U at turn9.\n\n          Therefore, minimal H is 4.\n\n      So the path we found: S, U, U, U.\n\n      But let me verify the safety:\n\n        Turn9: at (0,6) -> freeway6 at turn9: safe (danger at 16,17,18 -> not 9).\n        Action: S -> so we stay at 6? Then at turn10: we are at (0,6). But wait: we did S -> then y10 = 6? Then at turn10: we are at freeway6 -> check: freeway6 at turn10: safe? yes.\n\n        Then at turn10: we do U -> then y11 = 7? Then at turn11: we are at freeway7. Check freeway7 at turn11: danger set {10} -> 11 not in -> safe.\n\n        Then at turn11: we do U -> then y12 = 8. At turn12: freeway8: danger set {10} -> safe.\n\n        Then at turn12: we do U -> then y13 = 9. We are done.\n\n      So safe.\n\n      But wait: what about the path that went down to 5? We also found a path to (12,8) and then U to 9. But we found one that gets to 9 at turn13.\n\n      However, we found a path that gets to 9 at turn13 with 4 actions.\n\n      But note: we also have a path that went: \n          (9,6) -> D to (10,5) \n          then at (10,5): U to (11,6)\n          then at (11,6): U to (12,7)\n          then at (12,7): U to (13,8) -> not 9, so then we need another U at turn13: to (14,9) -> that would be 5 actions.\n\n      So the path we found is the shortest.\n\n      However, we found a path that goes: \n          (9,6) -> S to (10,6)\n          then (10,6) -> U to (11,7)\n          then (11,7) -> U to (12,8)\n          then (12,8) -> U to (13,9)\n\n      So the sequence: \n          Turn9: S\n          Turn10: U\n          Turn11: U\n          Turn12: U\n\n      We output:\n\n          Turn 9: S\n          Turn 10: U\n          Turn 11: U\n          Turn 12: U\n\n      But wait: the turn indices: \n          The actions are taken at turn9, turn10, turn11, turn12.\n\n      And at turn13, we are at (0,9) without taking an action? But the problem: we take actions until we are at (0,9). The last action is at turn12, which moves us to (0,9) at turn13.\n\n      The problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" so from t1=9 to 9+H-1.\n\n      Here H=4, so t=0,1,2,3 -> actions at 9,10,11,12.\n\n      And then at turn13 (which is t1+H-1 = 9+4-1=12? -> wait, t1+H-1 = 9+4-1=12? But we are at turn13? \n\n      Actually, the player update: \n          At turn9: we take action a9 -> then at turn10 we are at y10.\n          At turn10: we take a10 -> then at turn11 we are at y11.\n          At turn11: we take a11 -> then at turn12 we are at y12.\n          At turn12: we take a12 -> then at turn13 we are at y13=9.\n\n      But the problem says: at turn t1+H-1 we are at (0,9). So we require at turn t1+H-1 to be at (0,9). \n\n      Here, t1=9, H=4, then t1+H-1=12. But at turn12, we are at (0,8) (after the third action) and then we take the fourth action to get to (0,9) at turn13. So at turn12, we are not at (0,9). \n\n      This is a confusion.\n\n      Let me re-read the problem:\n\n        \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\n        and then: \"at turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9)\".\n\n      How the state evolves:\n\n        At the start of turn t1: we are at (0, y_{t1}).\n\n        Then we take an action a_{t1} -> then at the start of turn t1+1, we are at (0, y_{t1+1}).\n\n        After taking H actions (at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1), we are at the start of turn t1+H, at position (0, y_{t1+H}) and we require that y_{t1+H}=9.\n\n      But the problem says: \"at turn t1+H-1\" we are at (0,9)? \n\n      Actually, the problem states: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning the actions are taken at turns: t1+0, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\n        Then after the last action (at turn t1+H-1), we are at the state at the next turn? \n\n        The update: \n            after action at turn t, we get y_{t+1}.\n\n        So after the last action at turn t1+H-1, we get y_{t1+H} = 9.\n\n        Therefore, we are at (0,9) at turn t1+H.\n\n        But the problem says: \"at turn t1+H-1\" we are at (0,9)? \n\n      This is a discrepancy.\n\n      Let me check the problem statement: \n          \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions ... to reach (0,9)\"\n\n          and then in the answer format: we output the actions for turn t1, t1+1, ... until the last action.\n\n      And then: \"at turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9)\"? \n\n      Actually, the problem says: \"at turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9)\"? \n\n      I see: \n          \"Find a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{H-1} which minimizes H such that y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\n      So the player position after the actions is y_{t1+H-1} = 9.\n\n      How is y_{t1+H-1} defined? \n\n        We take an action at turn t1+t for t=0 to H-1.\n\n        Then:\n\n          At turn t1: we take a_{t1} -> then y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + \\Delta a_{t1}\n\n          At turn t1+1: we take a_{t1+1} -> then y_{t1+2} = y_{t1+1} + \\Delta a_{t1+1}\n\n          ...\n\n          At turn t1+H-1: we take a_{t1+H-1} -> then y_{t1+H} = y_{t1+H-1} + \\Delta a_{t1+H-1}\n\n        But the problem says: we require y_{t1+H-1} = 9.\n\n      This is confusing.\n\n      Actually, the problem defines the state at turn t as (0,y_t). Then the action a_t is taken at turn t, and then the state at turn t+1 is updated.\n\n      So we start at turn t1: state y_{t1} = 6.\n\n      Then we take an action a_{t1} to get y_{t1+1}.\n\n      Then we take an action a_{t1+1} to get y_{t1+2}.\n\n      ...\n\n      Then we take an action a_{t1+H-1} to get y_{t1+H}.\n\n      But the problem says: we require y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\n      That means: we are at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1? Then we take an action at turn t1+H-1? But if we are already at 9, then we don't need to take that last action? \n\n      Alternatively, the indexing might be that the state y_t is after the action at turn t-1? \n\n      The problem says: \"Player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + \\Delta y_t\", meaning that at turn t, we take an action that moves us to y_{t+1}.\n\n      So the state at turn t is y_t. Then we take action a_t to get to y_{t+1}.\n\n      Therefore, to be at (0,9) at turn T, we have y_T = 9.\n\n      And the last action is taken at turn T-1.\n\n      The problem: \"minimizes H such that y_{t1+H-1} = 9\"\n\n      Here, if we set T = t1+H-1, then we require y_T = 9.\n\n      Then the actions taken are from turn t1 to turn T-1 = t1+H-2? \n\n      But the problem says the sequence is for t=0 to H-1: \n          a_{t1+0}, a_{t1+1}, ..., a_{t1+H-1}\n\n      Then the last action is at turn t1+H-1, which would produce y_{t1+H} = y_{t1+H-1} + \\Delta a_{t1+H-1} = 9 + \\Delta a_{t1+H-1}? \n\n      This does not match.\n\n      Let me re-read: \n\n          \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\"\n\n          and then \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\"\n\n      How many actions? H actions, at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\n      How many state updates? H updates: from y_{t1} to y_{t1+1}, then to y_{t1+2}, ... to y_{t1+H}.\n\n      But we require y_{t1+H-1}=9? \n\n      That would mean that after H-1 actions (at turns t1 to t1+H-2) we are at y_{t1+H-1}=9, and then we take an extra action at turn t1+H-1? \n\n      The problem says: the sequence has H actions, so we take an action at turn t1+H-1. Then we get y_{t1+H} = y_{t1+H-1} + \\Delta a_{t1+H-1} = 9 + \\Delta a_{t1+H-1} which might not be 9.\n\n      This is inconsistent.\n\n      Alternatively, the problem might mean: we take H actions, and then at the state after the last action we are at y_{t1+H}=9. Then the turn at which we are at (0,9) is t1+H.\n\n      But the problem says: at turn t1+H-1 we are at (0,9).\n\n      Let me check the example: if we do 3 actions: \n          turn9: U -> y10 = 7\n          turn10: U -> y11 = 8\n          turn11: U -> y12 = 9\n          Then at the start of turn12, we are at y12=9. \n          So we took actions at turn9,10,11 (3 actions) and we are at (0,9) at turn12.\n\n      Then H=3, and we require y_{t1+H-1} = y_{9+3-1}=y_{11}=8, not 9.\n\n      Therefore, I think there is a mistake.\n\n      The problem states: \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\", meaning the state at turn t1+H-1 is 9.\n\n      But by the update, after k actions, we are at y_{t1+k} at the start of turn t1+k.\n\n      So to be at y_{t1+H-1}=9, we need to have taken H-1 actions? \n\n      But then the sequence of actions would be H-1 actions? \n\n      The problem says the sequence is for t=0 to H-1, which is H actions.\n\n      I think the indexing in the problem is:\n\n          The state at the beginning of turn t is y_t.\n          Then we take action a_t at turn t, and then we get y_{t+1} = y_t + \\Delta a_t.\n\n          Therefore, the action a_t is taken at turn t, and it moves us to y_{t+1}.\n\n          We start at turn t1: state y_{t1}=6.\n\n          We take actions at turn t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1 (so H actions) to get to y_{t1+H}=9.\n\n          Then we are at (0,9) at the beginning of turn t1+H.\n\n          The problem says: \"at turn t1+H-1\" we are at (0,9)? \n\n          That would be the state at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 is 9? But then we would take an action at turn t1+H-1 to get to y_{t1+H} which might not be 9.\n\n      Alternatively, the problem might mean that after taking the last action (at turn t1+H-1) we are at (0,9) at the next turn? But then the turn we are at (0,9) is t1+H.\n\n      But the problem says: \"at turn t1+H-1\" we are at (0,9). \n\n      This is confusing.\n\n      Looking back at the problem statement: \n          \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions ... to reach (0,9)\"\n\n          and then: \"at turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9)\"\n\n      And the answer format: we output the actions for turn t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\n      So I think they mean: \n          We take an action at turn t to affect the state at the next turn.\n\n          But the collision check is at the turn when we are on the freeway: at the beginning of the turn, before taking the action? Or after? \n\n      The problem says: \n          \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 in Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\n          and \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} != y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 in Span(T) but not in Span(T+1).\"\n\n      This implies that at turn T, we are on freeway y_T (the state at the beginning of turn T is y_T). Then we take an action to move to y_{T+1}. \n\n      Therefore, the state at the beginning of turn T is y_T, and we are on freeway y_T at turn T.\n\n      Then we take an action a_T to move to y_{T+1} (which will be the state at the beginning of turn T+1).\n\n      So to be at (0,9) at the beginning of turn T, we set y_T=9.\n\n      And the last action we took was at turn T-1, which moved us to y_T=9.\n\n      The sequence of actions: from turn t1 to turn T-1. The number of actions H = T - t1.\n\n      Then the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\" and then \"at turn t1+H-1\" we are at (0,9)? \n\n      If H = T - t1, then T = t1 + H.\n\n      Then we are at (0,9) at turn t1+H.\n\n      But the problem says: at turn t1+H-1 we are at (0,9). \n\n      So it's not matching.\n\n      Alternatively, if they define H as the number of turns we are simulating (including the starting turn?) then it might be different.\n\n      Given the confusion, let me look at the example in the problem? There is no example.\n\n      But in the answer format, they output:\n\n          Turn t1: a_{t1}\n          Turn t1+1: a_{t1+1}\n          ...\n          Turn t1+H-1: a_{t1+H-1}\n\n      and then after taking the last action at turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9) at the next turn.\n\n      But then we are at (0,9) at turn t1+H.\n\n      And the problem says \"at turn t1+H-1\" we are at (0,9) is not true.\n\n      I think there is a mistake in the problem statement.\n\n      However, in the task description, it says: \"Find a sequence of actions ... which minimizes H such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\"\n\n      So they require that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\n      How can that happen? \n\n        We start at turn t1: y_{t1}=6.\n\n        After 0 actions: we are at turn t1: y_{t1}=6.\n        After 1 action (at turn t1): we are at turn t1+1: y_{t1+1}=?\n        ...\n\n        After k actions: we are at turn t1+k: y_{t1+k}=?\n\n        We require that after H-1 actions, we are at y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\n        But then we are also taking H actions? \n\n      The problem says the sequence has H actions.\n\n      This implies that we take H actions, but then we are at state y_{t1+H} (after the last action), not y_{t1+H-1}.\n\n      Therefore, I think the problem meant to say: \n          \"minimizes H such that y_{t1+H}=9\"\n\n      and then we output actions for turns t1 to t1+H-1.\n\n      And then the turn at which we are at (0,9) is t1+H.\n\n      But the problem explicitly says: \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\".\n\n      Given the confusion, I will output the sequence that gets us to (0,9) as soon as possible, which is at turn13 (t1+4) for the above path, and we took 4 actions.\n\n      But if the problem requires y_{t1+H-1}=9, then we need to be at 9 at turn12 (t1+3) by taking only 3 actions? But we couldn't.\n\n      Alternatively, they might consider that we don't take an action on the turn we arrive? \n\n      But the problem says: we take a sequence of actions until we reach (0,9).\n\n      Given the above simulation, the minimal number of actions is 4.\n\n      And we found a path with 4 actions.\n\n      So we output:\n\n        Turn 9: S\n        Turn 10: U\n        Turn 11: U\n        Turn 12: U\n\n      And we are at (0,9) at turn13.\n\n      But if the problem requires y_{12}=9, then we need to be at 9 at turn12. \n\n      How? \n          Start at turn9: y9=6.\n          Action at turn9: U -> would go to y10=7, but collision at turn10 on freeway7? not allowed.\n          Action at turn9: D or S -> then at turn10: we are at 5 or 6.\n          Then we need to go from 5/6 to 9 in 2 moves: that requires 3 moves: impossible.\n\n      Therefore, we cannot be at y12=9.\n\n      The next chance is at turn13: y13=9.\n\n      So minimal H: the number of actions to get to y_{t1+H}=9 is 4.\n\n      But the problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\", which would be y_{12}=9 -> which is not achievable.\n\n      This suggests there might be an error in the problem statement.\n\n      Given the problem says \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\", then we must have a state at the beginning of turn12 at y=9.\n\n      How can we achieve that? We need to have taken actions at turn9,10,11 to get to y12=9.\n\n      But as above, we cannot do three ups because the first up is blocked.\n\n      What if we do a different sequence? \n          turn9: D -> to y10=5 (safe)\n          turn10: U -> to y11=6 (safe)\n          turn11: U -> to y12=7 (safe) -> not 9.\n\n      Or \n          turn9: D -> y10=5\n          turn10: U -> y11=6\n          turn11: U -> y12=7 -> then we need one more U to get to 8 at turn13, and then to 9 at turn14.\n\n      Or \n          turn9: S -> y10=6\n          turn10: S -> y11=6\n          turn11: U -> y12=7\n\n      Or \n          turn9: S -> y10=6\n          turn10: U -> y11=7\n          turn11: U -> y12=8\n\n      Then we are at 8 at turn12.\n\n      To be at 9 at turn12, we would have to have moved from 8 to 9 at turn11? But that would be one move: then we would be at 9 at turn12? \n\n      But then the action at turn11: from y11 (which is 8) we do U -> then y12=9.\n\n      So if we can get to 8 at turn11, then we can do U at turn11 to get to 9 at turn12.\n\n      How to get to 8 at turn11? \n          from 6 at turn9 to 8 at turn11: that requires 2 moves: +2, so two ups.\n\n      But at turn9: we cannot do U (because then we would be at 7 at turn10, which is dangerous).\n\n      So we do:\n          turn9: S -> y10=6\n          turn10: U -> y11=7 (safe, because freeway7 at turn11 is safe)\n          turn11: U -> y12=8? -> but we want to be at 8 at turn11? \n\n      The state at turn11 is y11=7 (after the action at turn10).\n\n      Then at turn11: we do U -> then y12=8.\n\n      So we are at 8 at turn12, not turn11.\n\n      Therefore, we cannot be at 8 at turn11.\n\n      The only way to be at 8 at turn11 is to have done two ups: \n          turn9: U -> y10=7 (blocked) -> not allowed.\n\n      Therefore, we cannot be at 9 at turn12.\n\n      So the minimal is to be at 9 at turn13.\n\n      Given the problem asks for the minimal H such that y_{t1+H-1}=9, then we would require H-1 = 13 - 9 = 4, so H=5? \n\n      But then the sequence would be 5 actions, and we are at 9 at turn13, which is t1+4, so y_{t1+4}=9, so then we require H-1=4 -> H=5.\n\n      Then the sequence would be for turns 9,10,11,12,13: \n          action0 at turn9, action1 at turn10, ... action4 at turn13.\n\n      But then after action4 at turn13, we would be at y14, not y13.\n\n      It's very confusing.\n\n      Alternatively, if we let T = t1 + k be the turn when we are at y_T=9, then the number of actions taken is k (because we took actions at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+k-1).\n\n      Then the problem requires y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\n      Then T = t1+H-1, and the number of actions is H-1? \n\n      But the problem says the sequence has H actions.\n\n      This is not matching.\n\n      Given the time, I will output the sequence that gets to (0,9) at turn13 with 4 actions, as the shortest we found.\n\n      And since the problem example in the answer format might be flexible, and we found a valid safe path.\n\n      So the answer is:\n\n          Turn 9: S\n          Turn 10: U\n          Turn 11: U\n          Turn 12: U\n\n      This is 4 actions.\n\n      But the problem says we must reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1=9+4-1=12? \n\n      In our simulation, at turn12 we are at (0,8), and then after the action at turn12 we get to (0,9) at turn13.\n\n      So if the problem means that after the last action we are at (0,9), then we are at (0,9) at turn13, not turn12.\n\n      But the problem explicitly says: \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\", which is y_{12}=9.\n\n      Since we cannot achieve that, I must have made a mistake.\n\n      Re-check the move: \n\n          turn9: S -> then at turn10 we are at y10 = 6 (because S: no move) -> then at turn10, we are at (0,6) and freeway6: safe.\n          turn10: U -> then at turn11 we are at y11 = 7. At turn11, we are at freeway7: and turn11 is not in danger set for freeway7 (which is {10}) -> safe.\n          turn11: U -> then at turn12 we are at y12=8. At turn12, freeway8: danger set {10} -> safe.\n          turn12: U -> then at turn13 we are at y13=9.\n\n      So at turn12, we are at 8.\n\n      To be at 9 at turn12, we would have to have taken an action at turn11 that moved us to 9 at turn12, but from 7 at turn11, we can only move to 6,7, or 8.\n\n      So we cannot.\n\n      Therefore, the only hope is to be at 9 at turn12 by being there at the beginning of turn12.\n\n      How to get there? \n          We must have been at 8 at turn11, then do U at turn11 to get to 9 at turn12.\n          So we need to be at 8 at turn11.\n\n      How to get to 8 at turn11? \n          We start at 6 at turn9.\n          Then: \n             turn9: action -> to y10 = ?\n             turn10: action -> to y11 = 8.\n\n          So we need +2 in two moves: U and then U.\n\n          But turn9: U -> blocked.\n\n      Alternative: \n          turn9: U (blocked) -> not allowed.\n          turn9: D or S.\n\n      If we do turn9: D -> y10=5.\n          turn10: then we can do U -> y11=6.\n          turn11: U -> y12=7 -> not 8.\n\n      turn9: D -> y10=5.\n          turn10: U twice? not allowed: only one action per turn.\n\n      So impossible.\n\n      Therefore, the minimal is to be at 9 at turn13.\n\n      Given the problem's condition might be misstated, and since we have a safe path with 4 actions, I will output that.\n\n      If the problem requires exactly to be at 9 at turn t1+H-1, then we need to output a path that gets to 9 at turn12, which is impossible, so then there is no solution? That can't be.\n\n      Perhaps I missed a path.\n\n      What if we do:\n\n          turn9: U (blocked) -> skip.\n          turn9: D -> to 5.\n          turn10: U -> to 6.\n          turn11: U -> to 7.\n          turn12: U -> to 8.\n          turn13: U -> to 9.\n\n      That's 5 actions.\n\n      But then we are at 9 at turn14, so y14=9.\n\n      Then if we set H=5, then t1+H-1=9+5-1=13, so we require y13=9, but we are at 9 at turn14.\n\n      This doesn't work.\n\n      How about: \n\n          turn9: S -> 6\n          turn10: U -> 7\n          turn11: U -> 8\n          turn12: U -> 9   [then at turn13 we are at 9? or at turn12 we are at 9?]\n\n      Let's do the timeline:\n\n          Beginning of turn9: y9=6.\n          Action at turn9: S -> then y10=6.\n          Beginning of turn10: y10=6.\n          Action at turn10: U -> then y11=7.\n          Beginning of turn11: y11=7.\n          Action at turn11: U -> then y12=8.\n          Beginning of turn12: y12=8.\n          Action at turn12: U -> then y13=9.\n\n      So we are at 9 at turn13.\n\n      To be at 9 at turn12, we would need to have taken an action at turn11 that moved us from 8 to 9 at turn12, but at turn11 we are at 7, not 8.\n\n      So the earliest we can be at 9 is turn13.\n\n      Therefore, we must have H such that t1+H-1 = 13? \n          9 + H - 1 = 13 -> H = 5.\n\n      Then we output 5 actions.\n\n      But then we would output actions for turns 9,10,11,12,13.\n\n      But at turn13, we are at 9, so we don't need to take an action? \n\n      The sequence should be the actions that bring us to 9 at turn13.\n\n      The last action is at turn12: which is the fourth action.\n\n      So we only need 4 actions.\n\n      This indicates that the indexing in the problem is: \n          H is the number of actions taken, and we are at (0,9) at turn t1+H.\n\n      then the condition is: at turn t1+H, we are at (0,9), which is not written as y_{t1+H-1} but as y_{t1+H} = 9.\n\n      Given the problem says \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\", it might be a typo and they meant y_{t1+H}=9.\n\n      I think we should output the sequence for the actions that achieve the goal in the minimal number of actions (which is 4) and then we are at (0,9) at turn13.\n\n      So the answer is the 4 actions.\n\n      If the problem really requires y_{t1+H-1}=9, then we must output a sequence of 5 actions that gets us to 9 at turn13 (y13=9) and then the last action (the fifth) would be taken at turn13? but then we would move to y14.\n\n      So that doesn't work.\n\n      Therefore, I will assume that the problem meant: we are at (0,9) at turn t1+H, and we took H actions.\n\n      Then H=4.\n\n      Output:\n\n        Turn 9: S\n        Turn 10: U\n        Turn 11: U\n        Turn 12: U\n\n      If the problem meant that after H actions we are at (0,9) at turn t1+H, then this meets.\n\n      If the problem meant that we are at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1, then this does not meet, but we have no solution that meets that condition.\n\n Given the above, I think the intended meaning is that we are at (0,9) at turn t1+H.\n\n So the answer is the 4-action sequence.\n\n But to be safe, let me see if we can achieve it in 5 actions with being at 9 at turn13 ( which is t1+4) and then if we set H=5, then t1+H-1=13, so we require y13=9, which is satisfied.\n\n Then the sequence would be 5 actions, but the last action (at turn13) would be what? We are at 9 at turn13, so we don't need to move. We can do 'S'.\n\n Then the actions:\n\n      turn9: S\n      turn10: U\n      turn11: U\n      turn12: U\n      turn13: S\n\n This is 5 actions, and we are at y14=9? \n\n      turn13: we are at y13=9.\n      Action: S -> y14=9.\n\n      Then we are at 9 at turn14.\n\n      But we want to be at 9 at turn13.\n\n      If we do nothing at turn13, then we are still at 9 at turn14, but at turn13 we are at 9.\n\n      The problem: at turn13 (the beginning), we are at 9. Then we take an action at turn13: which is not needed.\n\n      The condition is: at turn t1+H-1=9+5-1=13, we are at (0,9) -> which is true at the beginning of turn13.\n\n      Then we output the actions including the action at turn13.\n\n      But the action at turn13 doesn't change anything.\n\n      So the sequence: S, U, U, U, S.\n\n      This achieves: \n          turn9: S -> y10=6 ( so at the beginning of turn10, we are at 6)\n          turn10: U -> y11=7\n          turn11: U -> y12=8\n          turn12: U -> y13=9\n          turn13: S -> y14=9\n\n      But at the beginning of turn13, we are at 9, which is what we want.\n\n      However, the action at turn13 is unnecessary.\n\n      But the problem: minimize H. If we can achieve being at 9 at turn13 with only 4 actions, then why take 5? \n\n      But with 4 actions, we are at 9 at turn13 (beginning) without taking an action at turn13. \n\n      How? \n          We take actions at turn9,10,11,12 -> then at the beginning of turn13, we are at 9.\n\n      So we don't take an action at turn13.\n\n      Therefore, the sequence has only 4 actions.\n\n      Then H=4, and we are at 9 at turn13 = t1+4 = 9+4 = 13, and the condition: at turn t1+H-1 = 9+4-1=12, we are at what? y12=8, not 9.\n\n      So it does not satisfy the condition.\n\n      With 4 actions, we are at 9 at turn13, so we want to set H=4 and then turn t1+H-1=12, but we are not at 9 then.\n\n      With 5 actions, we are at 9 at turn13 (at the beginning) and we take an action at turn13 (the fifth action), and then we are at 9 at turn14.\n\n      but the condition is for turn13 ( which is t1+4) = 13? -> wait, t1+H-1 = 9+5-1=13, so turn13.\n\n      and at turn13, we are at 9? \n\n          At the beginning of turn13, before any action, we are at y13.\n          With the first 4 actions, we have y13=9.\n          So at the beginning of turn13, we are at 9.\n\n      Therefore, the condition is satisfied at the beginning of turn13.\n\n      Then we take the fifth action at turn13, which is not necessary, but it is part of the sequence.\n\n      So the minimal H is 5, and the sequence is the 4 actions to get to 9 at turn13 plus one extra action (S) at turn13.\n\n      Then the sequence: \n\n          Turn9: S\n          Turn10: U\n          Turn11: U\n          Turn12: U\n          Turn13: S\n\n      This meets: \n          at the beginning of turn13, we are at 9, so condition satisfied.\n          and we took 5 actions.\n\n      Is there a sequence of 5 actions that gets us to 9 earlier? \n\n          We can try to be at 9 at turn12 (beginning) -> impossible.\n\n      Therefore, minimal H is 5.\n\n      Let me confirm with the a down-then-up path that might be faster? \n\n          turn9: D -> to 5 at turn10.\n          turn10: U -> to 6 at turn11.\n          turn11: U -> to 7 at turn12.\n          turn12: U -> to 8 at turn13.\n          turn13: U -> to 9 at turn14.\n\n      Then at the beginning of turn13, we are at 8, not 9.\n\n      So not.\n\n      The only path to have 9 at turn13 (beginning) is the one that does:\n\n          turn9: S (y10=6)\n          turn10: U (y11=7)\n          turn11: U (y12=8)\n          turn12: U (y13=9)\n\n      then at the beginning of turn13, we are at 9.\n\n      But then we have only taken 4 actions. \n\n      The problem requires a sequence of H actions, and then at turn t1+H-1=9+4-1=12, we are at y12=8, not 9.\n\n      So we need to take an action at turn13 to make it 5 actions: \n          then turn13: we do S (or anything) -> then we are at 9 at turn14.\n\n      but then at turn13 (beginning) we are at 9, so condition turn13=9+5-1=13 meets.\n\n      So we must take an extra action.\n\n      Therefore, minimal H is 5.\n\n      The sequence: \n\n          Turn9: S\n          Turn10: U\n          Turn11: U\n          return12: U\n          Turn13: S   (or U, but then we go to 10 which is clamped to 9, so same as S)\n\n      Let me verify the freeways:\n\n          turn9: at y=6 -> safe.\n          turn10: at y=6 -> safe.\n          turn11: at y=7 -> safe (freeway7: danger only at 10)\n          turn12: at y=8 -> safe (freeway8: danger only at 10)\n          turn13: at y=9 -> not a freeway, so safe.\n\n      The actions: \n          turn9: S -> then at turn10 we are at 6.\n          turn10: U -> then at turn11 we are at 7.\n          turn11: U -> then at turn12 we are at 8.\n          turn12: U -> then at turn13 we are at 9.\n          turn13: S -> then at turn14 we are at 9.\n\n      But the condition is: at turn t1+H-1=13, we are at (0,9) -> at the beginning of turn13, we are at 9, so yes.\n\n      Therefore, H=5.\n\n      So the answer is 5 actions.\n\n      Output:\n\n          Turn 9: S\n          Turn 10: U\n          Turn 11: U\n          Turn 12: U\n          Turn 13: S\n\n      But is there a path with H=5 that gets us to 9 at an earlier turn? \n\n          We are at 9 at turn13 (beginning) -> which is the earliest possible.\n\n      So minimal H is 5.\n\n      This and only this meets the condition.\n\n      Therefore, the answer is the above sequence.\n\n      Note: we could do any action at turn13: U, D, or S. But since we are at 9, U and D will be clamped to 9. So we can do U, D, or S. We choose S.\n\n      So final answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 5, with the sequence of actions starting at turn \\(t_1 = 9\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\).\n\n- At turn 9, the player is at \\((0, 6)\\).
