The goal is to reach (0,9) in minimal number of turns without colliding with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nPlayer movement: \n  - U: y increases by 1 (up)\n  - D: y decreases by 1 (down)\n  - S: stay (y unchanged)\n\nConstraints: \n  - y must be in [0,9]. So we cannot go below 0 or above 9.\n\nCollision condition:\n  - At turn T, if the player is at (0, y_T) and y_T is a freeway (i.e., between 1 and 8 inclusive), then we must avoid any car on that freeway at that turn.\n  - Specifically, if the car's span at turn T includes 0 (the x-coordinate where the player is) then collision occurs.\n\nImportant note: \n  - When moving from y_T to y_{T+1} at turn T, the player is considered to be on freeway y_T at turn T (and hence must avoid cars on freeway y_T at turn T). \n  - At the same turn T, when we are at y_T, we are not yet at y_{T+1}. So if we move to a new freeway at the next turn, we don't have to worry about the cars on that new freeway at the current turn.\n\nCar update:\n  - All cars in the given state are moving right (since direction is 'right').\n  - For a right-moving car: \n        initial span at t1 (turn 0) is [tau, h] (note: head h is greater than tail tau? Actually, the table says for freeway 1: (-48,-59,right,4) ... but note that -48 > -59, so head h = -48, tail tau = -59. Then the span is [tau, h] = [-59, -48] for that car? But the table says (head, tail) = (-48, -59). So let me interpret: \n        The car is defined by (head, tail, direction, speed). For a right-moving car, the head is at the front (so a higher x-coordinate) and the tail at the back. But note: in the example for freeway 1: \n          (-48, -59, right, 4): head = -48, tail = -59 -> so the span is from -59 (tail) to -48 (head). \n\n  - The update for a right-moving car: \n        Span(T) = [tau + s*(T-t1), head + s*(T-t1)]\n        So at turn T, the car covers [tau + s*T, head + s*T] (since t1=0).\n\n  - Similarly, for left-moving, it would be [head - s*T, tail - s*T] but we don't have any left-moving.\n\nSo all cars are right-moving.\n\nWe are at turn 0. We need to plan a sequence of actions for turns 0, 1, 2, ... until we reach y=9.\n\nWe start at y0 = 0.\n\nWe note that at y=0 and y=9, there are no cars (freeways are from 1 to 8). So we are safe at these positions.\n\nOur goal is to get to y=9 as quickly as possible, but we must traverse the freeways 1 to 8 without being at an x=0 when a car's span covers 0 at the same turn.\n\nWe are going to simulate the movement and the car positions at each turn.\n\nLet me list the cars per freeway at turn 0 (t1=0):\n\nFreeway 1: \n  Car1: head=-48, tail=-59, speed=4 -> span at T: [-59 + 4*T, -48 + 4*T]\n  Car2: head=-12, tail=-23, speed=4 -> [-23+4T, -12+4T]\n  Car3: head=24, tail=13, speed=4 -> [13+4T, 24+4T]\n\nFreeway 2:\n  Car: head=48, tail=37, speed=12 -> [37+12T, 48+12T]\n\nFreeway 3:\n  Car: head=-48, tail=-59, speed=4 -> [-59+4T, -48+4T]\n\nFreeway 4:\n  Same as freeway 1: three cars: [-59+4T, -48+4T], [-23+4T, -12+4T], [13+4T,24+4T]\n\nFreeway 5: same as freeway 1.\n\nFreeway 6: same as freeway 1.\n\nFreeway 7: one car: [-59+4T, -48+4T]\n\nFreeway 8: one car: [-59+4T, -48+4T]\n\nWe note that the cars on freeways 3,7,8 are only the first car (the long one). The others have multiple.\n\nOur plan: we want to go from y=0 to y=9. The minimal number of moves without any obstacles would be 9 moves (all U). But there are obstacles.\n\nWe must avoid being at a freeway y (from 1 to 8) at a turn T when 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway at that turn.\n\nWe can also move down (D) if necessary to avoid a collision, but note that we cannot go below 0.\n\nWe can also stay (S) to wait.\n\nWe are going to try to compute the safety of each freeway at each turn.\n\nWe note that the cars move continuously. We are only concerned with the time when the player is at a freeway.\n\nWe are going to simulate the journey. We start at turn0: y0=0 (safe). Then we choose an action for turn0.\n\nWe want to minimize the number of turns, so we prefer to go up as much as possible.\n\nLet me try to see when we can go up without being hit.\n\nAt turn0: we are at y=0. We choose an action for turn0. We can choose U, D, or S.\n\nIf we choose U at turn0, then at turn1 we will be at y=1. But at turn1, we must check the freeway y=1 at turn1.\n\nAt turn1, freeway1:\n  Car1: [-59+4*1, -48+4*1] = [-55, -44] -> does 0 lie in [-55,-44]? No, because -55<=0<=-44 -> 0 is not in this interval? Actually, -55 <= -44, and 0 is greater than -44? So 0 is not in the interval. Similarly:\n  Car2: [-23+4, -12+4] = [-19, -8] -> 0 is not in this interval? (0 > -8) -> no.\n  Car3: [13+4,24+4]=[17,28] -> no.\n\nSo at turn1, freeway1 is safe.\n\nTherefore, we can go from y0=0 (turn0) to y1=1 (turn1) by using U at turn0.\n\nNow at turn1, we are at y=1 (freeway1). We then choose an action for turn1.\n\nWe want to go to y=2 as quickly as possible. So we try U.\n\nIf we choose U at turn1, then at turn2 we will be at y=2. Check freeway2 at turn2.\n\nFreeway2 at turn2: \n  Car: [37+12*2, 48+12*2] = [37+24, 48+24] = [61,72] -> 0 is not in [61,72] -> safe.\n\nSo we can go U at turn1 to get to y=2 at turn2.\n\nNow at turn2, we are at y=2. We choose U for turn2? Then at turn3 we will be at y=3.\n\nCheck freeway3 at turn3:\n  Car: [-59+4*3, -48+4*3] = [-59+12, -48+12] = [-47, -36] -> 0 is not in [-47,-36] -> safe.\n\nSo we go U at turn2 to y=3 at turn3.\n\nAt turn3, we are at y=3. We choose U at turn3? Then at turn4 we are at y=4.\n\nFreeway4 at turn4:\n  We have three cars:\n    Car1: [-59+4*4, -48+4*4] = [-59+16, -48+16] = [-43, -32] -> 0 not in.\n    Car2: [-23+4*4, -12+4*4] = [-23+16, -12+16] = [-7, 4] -> 0 is in [-7,4]? Yes, because -7<=0<=4 -> collision.\n\nSo at turn4, if we are at y=4, we will collide with the second car on freeway4.\n\nTherefore, we cannot go U at turn3.\n\nWhat are our options at turn3 (y=3)? \n  - We can choose S (stay) at turn3: then at turn4 we are still at y=3. Then we avoid freeway4 at turn4? But note: we are at y=3 at turn4, so we must check freeway3 at turn4? \n      Freeway3 at turn4: \n          Car: [-59+4*4, -48+4*4] = [-43, -32] -> safe.\n\n  - Or we can choose D: then at turn4 we go down to y=2. Then at turn4 we are at y=2, so we check freeway2 at turn4: \n        [37+12*4, 48+12*4] = [37+48,48+48] = [85,96] -> safe.\n\nBut we want to go up, so staying or going down might delay.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to avoid the collision by waiting at y=3 until the car on freeway4 passes.\n\nWhen will the car2 on freeway4 be clear of 0?\n  Car2: at turn T: [-23+4T, -12+4T] covers 0 when -23+4T <= 0 <= -12+4T.\n        => 4T <= 23  => T <= 5.75\n        and 0 <= -12+4T => 4T>=12 => T>=3.\n\nSo it covers 0 for T in [3,5] (since T is integer: T=3,4,5) because:\n  T=3: [-23+12, -12+12] = [-11,0] -> 0 is included? Actually, the interval is [-11,0] and 0 is included? But note the representation: the car spans from tail to head. For T=3: tail=-23+12=-11, head=-12+12=0 -> so the span is [-11,0] and it includes 0? Yes.\n\n  T=4: [-23+16, -12+16] = [-7,4] -> includes 0.\n  T=5: [-23+20, -12+20] = [-3,8] -> includes 0.\n\n  T=6: [-23+24, -12+24] = [1,12] -> does not include 0.\n\nSo after turn5, the car2 on freeway4 is safe.\n\nBut note: we are at turn3 at y=3. If we wait at y=3 for 3 turns (turn3: stay, turn4: stay, turn5: stay), then at turn6 we can move to y=4 without collision? But we have to check freeway3 at turns4 and 5 and 6? \n\nActually, we are at y=3 during turns4 and 5 (if we stay). So we must check freeway3 at turns4 and 5.\n\nFreeway3 at turn4: \n  Car: [-59+16, -48+16] = [-43, -32] -> safe.\n\nFreeway3 at turn5:\n  Car: [-59+20, -48+20] = [-39, -28] -> safe.\n\nThen at turn6, we go U from y=3 to y=4. Then at turn6 we are at y=4? Actually, we are at y=4 at turn6? But we must check freeway4 at turn6.\n\nFreeway4 at turn6: \n  Car1: [-59+24, -48+24] = [-35, -24] -> safe.\n  Car2: [-23+24, -12+24] = [1,12] -> safe (0 not in [1,12]).\n  Car3: [13+24,24+24]=[37,48] -> safe.\n\nSo that is safe.\n\nBut that would take 3 extra turns (from turn3 to turn6) to go from y=3 to y=4. That is too long.\n\nAlternatively, we could go down at turn3 to y=2 at turn4, then at turn4 we are at y=2. Then we can try to go up again at turn4? But then we would be at y=3 at turn5. Then at turn5, we must check freeway3 at turn5: which we already saw is safe. Then at turn5 we can go to y=4? But then at turn5 we are moving to y=4 at turn5? Actually, no: at turn5 we are at y=3 (if we went down at turn3 and then up at turn4: \n  turn3: at y=3, choose D -> at turn4: y=2.\n  turn4: at y=2, choose U -> at turn5: y=3.\n\nThen at turn5, we are at y=3. Then we can choose U at turn5 to go to y=4 at turn6? Then at turn6 we are at y=4 and we check freeway4 at turn6: safe as above.\n\nSo that is the same number of turns: from turn3 to turn6 (3 turns) to get to y=4.\n\nBut note: we are trying to minimize the total turns. We are at turn3 (we have already taken 3 turns: turn0,1,2,3) and we are at y=3. We want to get to y=9.\n\nIf we take 3 more turns to get to y=4, that would be 6 turns to get to y=4. Then we have 5 more freeways (y=4 to y=9) to go. But we might encounter more obstacles.\n\nAlternatively, we might avoid the collision at freeway4 by timing differently. We might go up at turn3 to y=4 at turn4 and collide? That we cannot do. So we have to avoid.\n\nBut wait, is there a way to go up at a different time? We are constrained by the car schedules.\n\nAnother idea: we can try to go up twice quickly? But we are at y=3 at turn3. We cannot go up at turn3 and then again at turn4 because we would be at y=4 at turn4 and then y=5 at turn5. But we are forced to check freeway4 at turn4 (which is unsafe) and freeway5 at turn5? Let me check freeway5 at turn5.\n\nFreeway5 has the same cars as freeway4. So at turn5, freeway5:\n  Car2: [-23+4*5, -12+4*5] = [-23+20, -12+20] = [-3,8] -> includes 0 -> unsafe.\n\nSo if we go from y=3 (turn3) to y=4 (turn4) we collide at freeway4. Then if we go to y=5 at turn5, we would be at freeway5 at turn5 and collide.\n\nSo we must avoid being at freeway4 at turns4 and freeway5 at turns5? Actually, we have to avoid each freeway at the turn we are on it.\n\nBut note: we can try to skip freeway4 and freeway5 by going faster? But we can only move one step at a time.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to wait at a lower freeway until the cars pass.\n\nBut let me see the schedule for the critical cars:\n\nOn freeways 4,5,6: \n  The car2 (which is the one that causes the problem) is present and covers 0 from turn3 to turn5 (inclusive). So at turn6, it is clear.\n\nSimilarly, on freeway1,2,3,7,8: \n  freeway1: car2: same as above: covers 0 at turns3,4,5? \n      For freeway1 at turn T: \n          car2: [-23+4T, -12+4T] -> covers 0 for T in [3,5] (as above).\n  freeway3: only one car? The car: [-59+4T, -48+4T] -> when does it cover 0?\n        -59+4T <= 0 <= -48+4T\n        => 4T <= 59 -> T<=14.75\n        and 0<=-48+4T => T>=12.\n        So it covers 0 from T=12 to T=14 (inclusive). We are at early turns (like T<10) so safe.\n\n  freeway7 and 8: same as freeway3? They also have the same car? \n        freeway7: one car: [-59+4T, -48+4T] -> same as freeway3: safe until T=12.\n        freeway8: same.\n\nBut note: freeway2: \n  Only one car: [37+12T, 48+12T] -> when does it cover 0?\n        37+12T <= 0 <= 48+12T -> \n        But 37+12T is positive for T>=0, so 0 is never in the interval? Because 37+12T >=37>0 -> so the entire car is always to the right of 0? Therefore, freeway2 is always safe? \n\n  Let me check: \n      T=0: [37,48] -> doesn't include 0? Correct.\n      T=1: [49,60] -> no.\n      T=2: [61,72] -> no.\n\n  So freeway2 is always safe.\n\nSo the problematic freeways are 1,4,5,6 (because they have the car2 that covers 0 at turns 3,4,5). \n\nBut note: we have already passed freeway1 at turn1. And at turn1, we were safe because the car2 at freeway1: \n      at T=1: [-23+4, -12+4] = [-19,-8] -> does not include 0.\n\nSo we are safe at freeway1 at turn1.\n\nBut what about freeway4,5,6? They have the same car2 and the same schedule.\n\nTherefore, we must avoid being on freeway4,5,6 at turns 3,4,5? But note: we are at turn3 at y=3. We want to go up to y=4,5,6. \n\nWe must not be at freeway4 at turn4 (if we go up at turn3) because that would be turn4 and freeway4: unsafe.\n\nBut we can try to be at freeway4 at a turn other than 4? For example, if we delay our arrival at freeway4 until turn6.\n\nHow can we do that?\n\nWe are at turn3: y=3. We can:\n  Option1: Stay at y=3 for 3 turns (turns3,4,5) and then at turn6 go to y=4. Then at turn6 we are at y=4 (freeway4) and it is safe. Then at turn6 we can go to y=5 at turn7? Then at turn7 we are at y=5 (freeway5). At turn7, freeway5: \n        car2: [-23+4*7, -12+4*7] = [-23+28, -12+28] = [5,16] -> safe (0 not in).\n        So we can go to y=5 at turn7. Then to y=6 at turn8: freeway6 at turn8: \n              car2: [-23+32, -12+32] = [9,20] -> safe.\n\n  Then we can continue: \n        turn8: y=6 -> U to y=7 at turn9: freeway7 at turn9: \n              car: [-59+36, -48+36] = [-23, -12] -> safe (0 not in) because -23<=0<=-12 -> 0 is not in the interval? Actually, the interval is [-23, -12] and 0 is not in between? It is below -12? So no.\n\n        Actually, 0 is greater than -12? So no.\n\n        Then turn9: y=7 -> U to y=8 at turn10: freeway8 at turn10: \n              car: [-59+40, -48+40] = [-19, -8] -> safe.\n\n        Then turn10: y=8 -> U to y=9 at turn11: safe (y=9 is not a freeway).\n\n  Total turns: from turn0 to turn10: 11 turns? But we started at turn0 and we take actions at turn0,1,...,10 (11 actions) to be at y=9 at turn11? \n\n  Actually, we are at turn0: y0=0.\n  turn0: U -> turn1: y1=1.\n  turn1: U -> turn2: y2=2.\n  turn2: U -> turn3: y3=3.\n  Then at turn3: we choose to stay for 3 turns? \n        turn3: S -> turn4: y4=3.\n        turn4: S -> turn5: y5=3.\n        turn5: S -> turn6: y6=3.\n        turn6: U -> turn7: y7=4.\n        turn7: U -> turn8: y8=5.\n        turn8: U -> turn9: y9=6.\n        turn9: U -> turn10: y10=7.\n        turn10: U -> turn11: y11=8.\n        turn11: U -> turn12: y12=9.\n\n  That is 12 turns? We are at turn0 and we take 12 actions? The turns are from turn0 to turn11 (12 steps) to reach turn12? But the problem says: we are to output a sequence of actions for turns t1, t1+1, ... until we reach at turn t1+H-1 the position (0,9). So H is the number of actions. We need H actions to get from turn0 to turn0+H-1? \n\n  Actually, if we take H actions, we are at turn0+H. But the position at turn0+H is y_{t1+H} = 9.\n\n  We start at turn0: we are at (0,0). After one action (turn0): we are at turn1. We want to be at (0,9) at some turn T. The turn index T is the turn after the last action.\n\n  The problem: we are to find H and a sequence {a_{t1+t} for t=0 to H-1 such that at turn t1+H, the player is at (0,9). \n\n  So if we take H actions, we go from turn0 to turnH. We start at turn0: state0. After a0: state1. After a1: state2. ... After a_{H-1}: stateH.\n\n  We require stateH: y_H = 9.\n\n  So in the above plan, we have:\n\n      Turn0: a0 -> at turn1: y1=1\n      Turn1: a1 -> at turn2: y2=2\n      Turn2: a2 -> at turn3: y3=3\n      Turn3: a3=S -> at turn4: y4=3\n      Turn4: a4=S -> at turn5: y5=3\n      Turn5: a5=S -> at turn6: y6=3\n      Turn6: a6=U -> at turn7: y7=4\n      Turn7: a7=U -> at turn8: y8=5\n      Turn8: a8=U -> at turn9: y9=6\n      Turn9: a9=U -> at turn10: y10=7\n      Turn10: a10=U -> at turn11: y11=8\n      Turn11: a11=U -> at turn12: y12=9\n\n  So H=12.\n\nBut we might do better.\n\nAlternative plan: \n\n  Instead of staying at y=3 for three turns, we might go down to y=2 at turn3? Then we can try to go up again. But we have to avoid freeway4,5,6 at the critical times.\n\n  At turn3: we are at y=3. We choose D -> then at turn4: y=2 (freeway2 is always safe, as we saw).\n\n  Then at turn4: we are at y=2. We can choose to go up to y=3 at turn5? Then at turn5: we are at y=3 (freeway3: safe as we saw). \n\n  Then at turn5: we can choose to go up to y=4 at turn6? Then at turn6: we are at freeway4: safe (as above).\n\n  Then we can go up continuously? \n\n  So the sequence:\n\n      turn0: U -> turn1: y=1\n      turn1: U -> turn2: y=2\n      turn2: U -> turn3: y=3\n      turn3: D -> turn4: y=2\n      turn4: U -> turn5: y=3\n      turn5: U -> turn6: y=4   (freeway4 at turn6: safe)\n      turn6: U -> turn7: y=5   (freeway5 at turn7: safe? \n            freeway5: car2 at turn7: [-23+4*7, -12+4*7]=[5,16] -> safe)\n      turn7: U -> turn8: y=6   (freeway6 at turn8: car2: [-23+32, -12+32]=[9,20] -> safe)\n      turn8: U -> turn9: y=7   (freeway7: at turn9: car: [-59+36, -48+36]=[-23,-12] -> safe)\n      turn9: U -> turn10: y=8  (freeway8 at turn10: car: [-59+40, -48+40]=[-19,-8] -> safe)\n      turn10: U -> turn11: y=9\n\n  Total actions: 11 (from turn0 to turn10). \n\n  So H=11.\n\nBut note: we started at y=0 at turn0. After 11 actions, we are at turn11: y=9.\n\nIs there a way to do it in 10 actions?\n\nWe must get from 0 to 9 in 10 moves? That would be 9 steps up and 1 step down? But we have to avoid the obstacles.\n\nAlternatively, we could go up without the detour? But we saw that going straight up at turn3 would cause a collision at turn4.\n\nWhat if we skip the waiting by going up earlier? We are at turn3: y=3. We cannot go up at turn3 because at turn4 we would be at y=4 and collide.\n\nBut what if we had gone slower in the beginning? \n\nFor example, at turn0: we could stay at y=0 for a turn? But that would only delay and we have no obstacle at y=0.\n\nAlternatively, at turn2: we are at y=2. Instead of going up to y=3 at turn3, we could stay at y=2 at turn3? Then at turn3 we are at y=2 (freeway2: safe). Then at turn4: we go to y=3? Then at turn4: freeway3: safe? \n        freeway3 at turn4: [-59+16, -48+16]=[-43,-32] -> safe.\n\nThen at turn5: we go to y=4? Then at turn5: freeway4: \n        car2: [-23+20, -12+20]=[-3,8] -> unsafe (0 in the interval).\n\nSo we still hit at turn5.\n\nAlternatively, we could wait at y=2 until turn6? Then go up? \n\n  turn0: U -> turn1: y=1\n  turn1: U -> turn2: y=2\n  turn2: S -> turn3: y=2\n  turn3: S -> turn4: y=2\n  turn4: S -> turn5: y=2\n  turn5: U -> turn6: y=3\n  turn6: U -> turn7: y=4 -> freeway4 at turn7: safe? \n        car2: [-23+28, -12+28]=[5,16] -> safe.\n  turn7: U -> turn8: y=5 -> freeway5 at turn8: \n        car2: [-23+32, -12+32]=[9,20] -> safe.\n  turn8: U -> turn9: y=6 -> freeway6 at turn9: \n        car2: [-23+36, -12+36]=[13,24] -> safe.\n  turn9: U -> turn10: y=7 -> freeway7 at turn10: \n        car: [-59+40, -48+40]=[-19,-8] -> safe.\n  turn10: U -> turn11: y=8 -> freeway8 at turn11: \n        car: [-59+44, -48+44]=[-15,-4] -> unsafe? \n        Because -15<=0<=-4? 0 is in [-15,-4]? Actually, 0 is greater than -4? So no, it doesn't include 0? \n        The interval is [-15, -4] -> 0 is not in the interval? Because 0 is greater than -4? So safe.\n  turn11: U -> turn12: y=9.\n\n  That is 12 actions? \n\nBut note: we did 12 actions: turn0 to turn11. Then at turn12: y=9.\n\nAlternatively, after y=2 we could go up faster? But we have to avoid the critical turns for freeway4,5,6: turns 3,4,5. So if we are at freeway4 at turn7 (which is safe) and freeway5 at turn8 (safe) and freeway6 at turn9 (safe), that is acceptable.\n\nBut we see that at freeway8 at turn11: the car is [-15,-4] -> does not include 0? Correct.\n\nBut we are at freeway8 at turn11: safe. Then we go to y=9 at turn12.\n\nTotal actions: 12.\n\nBut our previous detour (with one down) was 11. So 11 is better.\n\nCan we do 10?\n\nWe must get to y=9 at turn10. That means we need 10 moves? \n\nWe start at y0=0. After 10 moves, we are at turn10: y10 must be 9. So we must have exactly 9 net up moves and 1 down move? Or 10 up moves? But we can only go up to 9. We start at 0: 9 up moves would get us to 9. So we need 9 up moves and 1 other move (either down or stay) but that would be 10 moves? But then we would be at 9? \n\nBut we have to avoid the obstacles.\n\nThe problem is that we have to avoid the critical freeways at the critical turns. The critical turns for freeway4,5,6 are 3,4,5. We are going to pass freeway4 at some turn, freeway5 at the next, freeway6 at the next.\n\nWe must not be at freeway4 at turn4? But we could be at freeway4 at turn3? That would be too early? \n\nAt turn3: we can be at freeway4? How? \n  We start at turn0: y0=0.\n  turn0: U -> turn1: y=1.\n  turn1: U -> turn2: y=2.\n  turn2: U -> turn3: y=3. \n  But that is freeway3, not freeway4.\n\nTo be at freeway4 at turn3: we would have to be at y=4 at turn3. But that would require 4 up moves in 3 moves? Not possible.\n\nSo we cannot be at freeway4 at turn3.\n\nWe cannot be at freeway4 at turn4? We can: \n      turn0: U -> turn1:1\n      turn1: U -> turn2:2\n      turn2: U -> turn3:3\n      turn3: U -> turn4:4 -> but that is unsafe.\n\nWe can be at freeway4 at turn5? \n      turn0:U->1\n      turn1:U->2\n      turn2:U->3\n      turn3:S->3\n      turn4:U->4 at turn5 -> unsafe? because freeway4 at turn5: car2: [-3,8] -> unsafe.\n\nAt turn6: safe.\n\nSo we must be at freeway4 at turn6 or later.\n\nSimilarly, freeway5: we must be at it at turn7 or later? Because at turn5 and 6 it is unsafe? \n      freeway5: car2: at turn5: [-3,8] -> unsafe (covers 0)\n                turn6: [1,12] -> safe? \n                Actually, at turn6: [-23+24, -12+24] = [1,12] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\nBut wait: we have to check the entire freeway5 at the turn we are on it. So if we are at freeway5 at turn6: \n        car2: [1,12] -> does not include 0 -> safe.\n        car1: [-59+24, -48+24]=[-35,-24] -> safe.\n        car3: [13+24,24+24]=[37,48] -> safe.\n\nSo freeway5 is safe at turn6.\n\nSimilarly, freeway6: at turn6: \n        car2: [1,12] -> safe? \n        But wait: freeway6 has the same cars as freeway5? So at turn6: same as above: safe.\n\nBut note: the car2 on freeway5 and freeway6 are the same? Actually, they are independent. But they have the same schedule? Yes.\n\nSo we can be at freeway4 at turn6: safe.\n            freeway5 at turn7: safe? \n                  at turn7: freeway5: car2: [-23+28, -12+28]=[5,16] -> safe.\n            freeway6 at turn8: safe? [9,20] -> safe.\n\nBut then we can go:\n\n      turn0: U -> turn1:1\n      turn1: U -> turn2:2\n      turn2: U -> turn3:3\n      turn3: S -> turn4:3   (waiting one more turn? but we are at freeway3 at turn4: safe)\n      turn4: U -> turn5:4   -> at turn5: freeway4: unsafe? because at turn5: car2: [-3,8] -> unsafe.\n\nSo that doesn't work.\n\nWe must avoid freeway4 until turn6. How?\n\nWe must be at y=3 at turn5? Then we can go to y=4 at turn6? \n\nWe start at y0=0.\nWe need to be at y=3 at turn5? \n\nHow to get to y=3 at turn5:\n\n  turn0: U -> turn1:1\n  turn1: U -> turn2:2\n  turn2: S -> turn3:2\n  turn3: S -> turn4:2\n  turn4: U -> turn5:3\n\n  Then at turn5: we are at freeway3: safe? \n        freeway3 at turn5: car: [-59+20, -48+20]=[-39,-28] -> safe.\n\n  Then turn5: U -> turn6:4 (freeway4 at turn6: safe)\n  turn6: U -> turn7:5 (freeway5 at turn7: safe)\n  turn7: U -> turn8:6 (freeway6 at turn8: safe)\n  turn8: U -> turn9:7 (freeway7 at turn9: [-23,-12] -> safe)\n  turn9: U -> turn10:8 (freeway8 at turn10: [-19,-8] -> safe)\n  turn10: U -> turn11:9\n\n  That is 11 actions? \n\nBut we did 11 moves: turn0 to turn10: 11 actions -> then at turn11: y=9.\n\nAlternatively, we might be able to do:\n\n  turn0: U ->1\n  turn1: U ->2\n  turn2: S ->2\n  turn3: U ->3 at turn4? Then at turn4: freeway3: safe? \n        freeway3 at turn4: [-43,-32] -> safe.\n  Then at turn4: we are at y=3. We want to go to y=4 at turn5? But freeway4 at turn5 is unsafe? \n        freeway4 at turn5: car2: [-3,8] -> unsafe.\n\nSo we cannot go to y=4 at turn5.\n\nWe must wait until turn5 to be at y=3? Then at turn5: we are at y=3 (freeway3: safe) and then at turn6: we go to y=4 (safe). \n\nBut then we have:\n\n  turn0: U (1)\n  turn1: U (2)\n  turn2: S (2)   [at turn2: we are at y=2, so we can do S to stay at y=2 at turn3?]\n  turn3: S (2)   [at turn3: y=2]\n  turn4: U (3)   [at turn4: y=3? But we are at turn4: freeway3: safe? \n        freeway3 at turn4: [-43,-32] -> safe]\n  turn5: S (3)   [stay at y=3 at turn5: freeway3 at turn5: [-39,-28] -> safe]\n  turn6: U (4)   [freeway4 at turn6: safe]\n  turn7: U (5)   [freeway5 at turn7: safe]\n  turn8: U (6)   [freeway6 at turn8: safe]\n  turn9: U (7)   [freeway7: safe? at turn9: [-23,-12] -> safe]\n  turn10: U (8)  [freeway8 at turn10: [-19,-8] -> safe]\n  turn11: U (9)  [then at turn11: y=9]\n\n  Total 12 moves? \n\nBut we can skip one of the stays? \n\nWe want to be at y=3 at turn5. How?\n\n  We start: \n      turn0: U -> turn1:1\n      turn1: U -> turn2:2\n      Then we need to spend 3 turns at y=2? \n            turn2: S -> turn3:2\n            turn3: S -> turn4:2\n            turn4: U -> turn5:3\n\n      Then we have used 5 moves to get to y=3 at turn5.\n\n  Alternatively, we can do:\n\n      turn0: U ->1\n      turn1: S ->1   [then at turn2: y=1]\n      turn2: U ->2\n      turn3: U ->3 at turn4? Then at turn4: y=3 (freeway3: safe) and then we have to wait at turn4? because we cannot go to y=4 at turn5 (unsafe). So we must wait until turn6 to go to y=4.\n\n      Then:\n          turn4: S ->3\n          turn5: S ->3\n          turn6: U ->4\n          ... same as before: 11 moves? \n\n      But total moves: \n          turn0:U, turn1:S, turn2:U, turn3:U, turn4:S, turn5:S, turn6:U, ... until turn11:U -> 12 moves.\n\nSo it seems 11 moves is the best we have so far (with the down move).\n\nBut let me see if we can do 10 moves.\n\nWe need to be at y=9 at turn10. So we must have 9 up moves and 1 down move? Or 8 up moves and 2 stays? But then we wouldn't get to 9? \n\nWe must have exactly 9 net up moves. So we can have 9 up moves and 1 down move? Then the net is 8? Not enough. \nOr 10 up moves? But we start at 0: 10 up moves would take us to 10, which is not allowed. \n\nSo we must have exactly 9 up moves and 1 non-up move (either down or stay). But that non-up move must occur at a freeway where we can afford to do it? \n\nWe have to avoid the critical times at freeway4,5,6: turns 3,4,5. \n\nSuppose we do:\n\n      turn0: U ->1\n      turn1: U ->2\n      turn2: U ->3\n      turn3: D ->2   (instead of staying, we go down) -> at turn4: y=2\n      turn4: U ->3   at turn5: y=3\n      turn5: U ->4   at turn6: y=4 (freeway4: safe at turn6)\n      turn6: U ->5   at turn7: y=5 (freeway5: safe at turn7)\n      turn7: U ->6   at turn8: y=6 (freeway6: safe at turn8)\n      turn8: U ->7   at turn9: y=7 (freeway7: safe at turn9)\n      turn9: U ->8   at turn10: y=8 (freeway8: at turn10: [-19,-8] -> safe)\n\n      Then we are at y=8 at turn10. We need one more move to get to y=9? \n\n      So we do:\n          turn10: U ->9 at turn11.\n\n      That is 11 moves.\n\nBut we can do:\n\n      turn0: U ->1\n      turn1: U ->2\n      turn2: U ->3\n      turn3: D ->2\n      turn4: U ->3\n      turn5: U ->4\n      turn6: U ->5\n      turn7: U ->6\n      turn8: U ->7\n      turn9: U ->8\n      turn10: U ->9\n\n      Then at turn10 we do U and at turn11 we are at 9. Still 11 moves.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to do the down move earlier? \n\n      turn0: U ->1\n      turn1: D ->0   (then we are back at 0, which is safe, but we lost progress)\n      turn2: U ->1\n      ... then we are delayed.\n\nWe can try to use a stay:\n\n      turn0: U ->1\n      turn1: U ->2\n      turn2: S ->2   (at turn3: y=2)\n      turn3: U ->3   (at turn4: y=3)\n      turn4: U ->4   (at turn5: y=4 -> unsafe at freeway4? because at turn5: freeway4: car2: [-3,8] -> unsafe)\n\nSo that fails.\n\n      turn0: U ->1\n      turn1: U ->2\n      turn2: U ->3\n      turn3: S ->3   (at turn4: y=3)\n      turn4: U ->4   (at turn5: y=4 -> unsafe)\n\n      turn0: U ->1\n      turn1: U ->2\n      turn2: U ->3\n      turn3: U ->4   (at turn4: unsafe)\n\nSo we cannot avoid the critical turns without an extra move.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 11.\n\nWe choose the plan with the down move at turn3.\n\nSequence:\n\n  turn0: U\n  turn1: U\n  turn2: U\n  turn3: D   (we go down to y=2 at turn4)\n  turn4: U   (to y=3 at turn5)\n  turn5: U   (to y=4 at turn6)\n  turn6: U   (to y=5 at turn7)\n  turn7: U   (to y=6 at turn8)\n  turn8: U   (to y=7 at turn9)\n  turn9: U   (to y=8 at turn10)\n  turn10: U  (to y=9 at turn11)\n\nBut wait: at turn10 we are at y=8? Then we do U and at turn11 we are at y=9. So we need 11 actions.\n\nBut note: we must not collide at any freeway. Let's verify:\n\n  turn0: action U -> at turn1: y=1 (freeway1)\n        freeway1 at turn1: \n            car1: [-55,-44] -> safe.\n            car2: [-19,-8] -> safe.\n            car3: [17,28] -> safe.\n\n  turn1: action U -> at turn2: y=2 (freeway2)\n        freeway2 at turn2: [61,72] -> safe.\n\n  turn2: action U -> at turn3: y=3 (freeway3)\n        freeway3 at turn3: [-59+12, -48+12] = [-47,-36] -> safe.\n\n  turn3: action D -> at turn4: y=2 (freeway2)\n        freeway2 at turn4: [37+48,48+48]=[85,96] -> safe.\n\n  turn4: action U -> at turn5: y=3 (freeway3)\n        freeway3 at turn5: [-59+20, -48+20]=[-39,-28] -> safe.\n\n  turn5: action U -> at turn6: y=4 (freeway4)\n        freeway4 at turn6: \n            car1: [-59+24, -48+24]=[-35,-24] -> safe.\n            car2: [-23+24, -12+24]=[1,12] -> safe.\n            car3: [13+24,24+24]=[37,48] -> safe.\n\n  turn6: action U -> at turn7: y=5 (freeway5)\n        freeway5 at turn7: \n            car2: [-23+28, -12+28]=[5,16] -> safe.\n\n  turn7: action U -> at turn8: y=6 (freeway6)\n        freeway6 at turn8: \n            car2: [-23+32, -12+32]=[9,20] -> safe.\n\n  turn8: action U -> at turn9: y=7 (freeway7)\n        freeway7 at turn9: [-59+36, -48+36]=[-23,-12] -> safe (0 not in).\n\n  turn9: action U -> at turn10: y=8 (freeway8)\n        freeway8 at turn10: [-59+40, -48+40]=[-19,-8] -> safe.\n\n  turn10: action U -> at turn11: y=9 (goal).\n\nSo it works.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 11.\n\nOutput:\n\nTurn 0: U\nTurn 1: U\nTurn 2: U\nTurn 3: D\nTurn 4: U\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\n\nBut note: the problem says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\". Since t1=0, we have t from 0 to 10 (inclusive) for H=11.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 0: a_{0} = U\nTurn 1: a_{1} = U\nTurn 2: a_{2} = U\nTurn 3: a_{3} = D\nTurn 4: a_{4} = U\nTurn 5: a_{5} = U\nTurn 6: a_{6} = U\nTurn 7: a_{7} = U\nTurn 8: a_{8} = U\nTurn 9: a_{9} = U\nTurn 10: a_{10} = U\n\nBut wait: the last action (turn10) moves us from y=8 to y=9 at turn11. So we have 11 actions and we reach at turn11.\n\nThe problem says: \"a sequence of actions ... to reach (0,9)\". We have reached.\n\nSo we output:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 0: U\nTurn 1: U\nTurn 2: U\nTurn 3: D\nTurn 4: U\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\n}\n\nBut let me double-check: is there a way to do it in 10?\n\nWe need to be at y=9 at turn10. That requires 10 actions? \n\nWe start at y0=0. After 10 actions, we are at turn10: y10.\n\nWe must have y10=9.\n\nWe must have made 9 net up moves. So we must have 9 up moves and 1 non-up move? But then the net up moves would be 8? Not enough.\n\nUnless we have 10 up moves? But then we would be at y=10, which is not allowed (y in [0,9]). So we cannot have 10 up moves.\n\nTherefore, we must have exactly 9 up moves and 1 non-up move (down or stay). But then the net is 8? So we would be at y=8 at turn10? Not 9.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible in 10 moves.\n\nHence, 11 is minimal.\n\nWe have a valid 11-move sequence.\n\nSo the answer is as above.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 0\\) is 11, with the following sequence of actions:\n\n- At turn 0, move up (U) to reach \\((0, 1)\\) at turn 1. Freeway 1 at turn 1 is safe: cars are at \\([-55, -44]\\), \\([-19, -8]\\), \\([17, 28]\\), none containing 0.\n- At turn 1, move up (U) to reach \\((0, 2)\\) at turn 2.

Freeway 3 at turn 3 is safe: car at \\([-47, -36]\\), not containing 0.\n- At turn 3, move down (D) to reach \\((0, 2)\\) at turn 4. Freeway 2 at turn 4 is safe: car at \\([85, 96]\\), not containing 0.\n- At turn 4, move up (U) to reach \\((0, 3)\\) at turn 5. Freeway 3 at turn 5 is safe: car at \\([-39, -28]\\), not containing 0.\n- At turn 5, move up (U) to reach \\((0, 4)\\) at turn 6. Freeway 4 at turn 6 is safe: cars at \\([-35, -24]\\), \\([1, 12]\\), \\([37, 48]\\), none containing 0.\n- At turn 6, move up (U) to reach \\((0, 5)\\) at turn 7. Freeway 5 at turn 7 is safe: cars at \\([-35, -24]\\), \\([5, 16]\\), \\([37, 48]\\), none containing 0.\n- At turn 7, move up (U) to reach \\((0, 6)\\) at turn 8. Freeway 6 at turn 8 is safe: cars at \\([-35, -24]\\), \\([9, 20]\\), \\([37, 48]\\), none containing 0.\n- At turn 8, move up (U) to reach \\((0, 7)\\) at turn 9. Freeway 7 at turn 9 is safe: car at \\([-23, -12]\\), not containing 0.\n- At turn 9, move up (U) to reach \\((0, 8)\\) at turn 10. Freeway 8 at turn 10 is safe: car at \\([-19, -8]\\), not containing 0.\n- At turn 10, move up (U) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) at turn 11.

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at position (0, 1) at turn t_1 = 1. The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. Since the player is on y=1 initially, and we need to go to y=9, which is above, so we probably need to move up.\n\nThe vertical axis goes from 0 to 9, and freeways are from y=1 to y=8. y=0 and y=9 might be safe or something, but the collision only happens if on a freeway y=1 to 8 and at that position when a car is present.\n\nThe collision definition: at turn T, if the player is on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there is a car such that 0 is in its span at turn T. The span is the position where the car covers.\n\nAlso, when moving, if you move at turn T to a different y, you are not considered on that new y until the next turn. So at turn T, when you take action, you move to y_{T+1}, but during turn T, you are still on y_T.\n\nThe player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, based on action at time t.\n\nSo at time t, you choose a_t, which determines Δy_t, and then y_{t+1} is set accordingly.\n\nNow, for collision: collision occurs at turn T only if for the freeway y_T, and for any car on that freeway, 0 is in Span(T) for that car.\n\nSpan(T) is the position of the car at time T.\n\nIn this case, since the player is at x=0 always, I think. The grid is 2D, but player only moves vertically, I assume horizontally fixed at x=0? The position is (0, y_t), so x is always 0. And cars are on freeways, which are horizontal lanes, I think, and they move left or right.\n\nThe car span is given in terms of position, like head h and tail τ, so I think x-coordinate.\n\nFor a car on freeway i, at time t, its span is [min, max] in x-direction, and at x=0, if 0 is between min and max, then collision if player is on that freeway.\n\nAnd player is at (0, y_t), so at turn T, if y_T is between 1 and 8, and for that y, there is a car with 0 in its span at time T.\n\nNow, the cars are given for each freeway k (which is y=k, I think).\n\nFreeway k means y=k, I believe.\n\nIn the table, freeway k from 1 to 8.\n\nNow, current turn t_1=1, player at (0,1).\n\nWe need to reach (0,9).\n\nSince we start at y=1, and need to go to y=9, we must move up through y=2 to y=8, but we can stay or move down if needed to avoid cars.\n\nBut moving down might not be efficient since we need to go up.\n\nMinimal turns, so probably go up as fast as possible, avoiding collisions.\n\nH is the number of turns, from t=0 to H-1, but t_1 is given, so actions from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, and at turn t_1 + H -1, position should be (0,9).\n\nTurn indices: let's say we start at turn t_1, so time t = t_1.\n\nAt turn t, we choose a_t, which affects y_{t+1}.\n\nPosition at turn t is y_t.\n\nAt turn t, position is (0, y_t).\n\nThen we choose a_t, which sets Δy_t, so y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nThen at turn t+1, position is (0, y_{t+1}), and so on.\n\nCollision at turn T: when we are at position y_T, if y_T between 1 and 8, and for freeway y_T, there is a car with 0 in Span(T).\n\nSpan(T) is the car's position at time T.\n\nNow, for each freeway, the cars are given with their state at t_1=1.\n\nWe need to find for each turn T, where the cars are.\n\nFirst, let's list all cars for each freeway.\n\nFrom the table:\n\nFreeway 1: three cars\n\n- Car 1: head -44, tail -55, direction right, speed 4\n\n- Car 2: head -8, tail -19, direction right, speed 4\n\n- Car 3: head 28, tail 17, direction right, speed 4\n\nDirection right: since it says right-moving, and for right-moving, span is [τ, h] with τ < h? Let's see the update.\n\nIn the car update:\n\nFor left-moving: span(t1) = [h, τ] -> span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nFor right-moving: span(t1) = [τ, h] -> span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nIn the state, for freeway 1, first car: head -44, tail -55, direction right.\n\nFor right-moving, head should be greater than tail? But here head -44, tail -55, and -44 > -55, so head is right, tail left.\n\nIn the notation, for right-moving, it says span(t1) = [τ, h] with τ tail, h head, so τ ≤ h.\n\nHere tail -55, head -44, so τ = -55, h = -44.\n\nSimilarly, car 2: head -8, tail -19, so τ = -19? Head -8, tail -19, since -8 > -19, so for right-moving, tail should be left, head right, so τ = -19, h = -8.\n\nSpan(t1) = [τ, h] = [-19, -8] for car 2? But in the table it says (head h, tail τ, direction, speed), so for car 2: head -8, tail -19, so if direction right, head is the front, so when moving right, head increases.\n\nIn the span, for right-moving, at time T, span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nSince it moves right, positions increase.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, positions decrease.\n\nNow for freeway 1:\n\nCar 1: head = -44, tail = -55, dir right, s=4\n\nSo at t1=1, span = [τ, h] = [-55, -44]? No.\n\nAccording to the state, it says \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nFor right direction, head h is the right end, tail τ is the left end.\n\nIn the update for right-moving: span(t1) = [τ, h] and then span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, span(t1) = [h, τ] with h left, τ right? Let's see.\n\nFor left-moving: span(t1) = [h, τ] -> [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nAnd it says \"head h, tail τ\", so for left-moving, head is left, tail is right, I think.\n\nIn car 3 on freeway 1: head 28, tail 17, direction right. 28>17, so head right, tail left, so for right-moving, span = [tail, head] = [17,28] at t1? Tail 17, head 28, so if direction right, tail is left, head right, so span = [τ, h] = [17,28].\n\nSimilarly, car 2: head -8, tail -19, so τ = -19, h = -8, span = [-19, -8]\n\nCar 1: head -44, tail -55, τ = -55, h = -44, span = [-55, -44]\n\nAll direction right, speed 4.\n\nNow for other freeways.\n\nFreeway 2: only one car: head 60, tail 49, direction right, speed 12. So span at t1: [49,60]\n\nFreeway 3: one car: head -44, tail -55, direction right, speed 4, same as freeway 1 car 1, span [-55,-44]\n\nFreeway 4: three cars, same as freeway 1: (-44,-55,right,4), (-8,-19,right,4), (28,17,right,4) — head 28, tail 17, so span [17,28]? Tail 17, head 28, so [17,28]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 5: same as above.\n\nFreeway 6: same.\n\nFreeway 7: one car: (-44,-55,right,4), span [-55,-44]\n\nFreeway 8: one car: (-44,-55,right,4), span [-55,-44]\n\nFreeway 1 has three cars, but freeway 3,7,8 have only one, etc.\n\nLet's list for each freeway the cars at t1=1.\n\nt1=1.\n\nFor each freeway k, the cars present:\n\n- k=1: car A: [-55,-44], right, s=4; car B: [-19,-8], right, s=4; car C: [17,28], right, s=4? Head 28, tail 17, so if direction right, span [17,28]\n\nIn the state, for car C: (28,17,right,4), so head=28, tail=17, direction right, so since moving right, tail is left end, head right end, so span = [τ, h] = [17,28]\n\nSimilarly, car B: head=-8, tail=-19, so τ=-19, h=-8, span [-19,-8]\n\nCar A: τ=-55, h=-44, span [-55,-44]\n\nAll speed 4, right.\n\n- k=2: one car: head=60, tail=49, right, s=12, so span [49,60]\n\n- k=3: one car: head=-44, tail=-55, right, s=4, span [-55,-44]\n\n- k=4: three cars: same as k=1: [-55,-44], [-19,-8], [17,28]\n\n- k=5: same as k=1: [-55,-44], [-19,-8], [17,28]\n\n- k=6: same: [-55,-44], [-19,-8], [17,28]\n\n- k=7: one car: [-55,-44], right, s=4\n\n- k=8: one car: [-55,-44], right, s=4\n\nNow, we need to find for each turn T, for each freeway, where the cars are, to see if at position x=0, it is covered by any car on that freeway at that turn.\n\nSince the player is at x=0, we care about whether 0 is in the span for any car on freeway y at turn T.\n\nNow, the player starts at y=1 at turn t=1.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\ny=9 is not a freeway, it's the top, so no cars, so when we reach y=9, no collision possible, I think.\n\nThe freeways are only y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 should be safe.\n\nBut we start at y=1, which is a freeway.\n\nNow, to minimize turns, we want to go up as fast as possible, but we need to avoid being on a freeway when a car is at x=0.\n\nSince we can only move one step per turn or stay, the minimal time to go from y=1 to y=9 is 8 turns if we move up every turn, but we might need to wait or move down to avoid collisions.\n\nH is the number of turns from t_1, so from turn t_1 to t_1 + H -1, we take H actions, and at turn t_1 + H -1, y =9.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t_1 + H, position y_{t_1 + H} =9? Let's see.\n\nStart at turn t_1=1, position y_1 =1.\n\nWe take actions a_1, a_2, ..., a_{1+H-1} for t from 0 to H-1? The sequence is {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, so a_{1}, a_{2}, ..., a_{1+H-1}.\n\nThen after H actions, at turn t_1 + H, position is set.\n\nBut the position at turn t_1 + H is y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nWe need y_{t_1 + H -1} =9? No.\n\nThe sequence is actions from t=0 to H-1 for the offset, so actions at times t_1, t_1+1, ..., up to t_1 + H -1.\n\nAfter taking action at time t, we go to time t+1 with new y.\n\nSo at turn t_1, we start with y_{t_1}.\n\nThen we take a_{t_1}, which determines y_{t_1 +1}.\n\nThen at turn t_1 +1, we have position y_{t_1 +1}, and we take a_{t_1 +1}, and so on, up to after taking action at time t_1 + H -1, we have position at turn t_1 + H.\n\nBut we need the position at turn t_1 + H -1 to be 9? Let's read carefully.\n\n\"reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1\"\n\nFrom the task: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1\"\n\nIn the task: \"reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1\"\n\nAnd \"y_{t_1 + H -1} =9\"\n\nYes.\n\nAlso, in the answer, actions from turn t_1 to turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nFor example, action at turn t_1, turn t_1+1, ..., turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nAnd after all actions, at turn t_1 + H -1, position is (0,9).\n\nNow, at turn t_1 + H -1, we are at y=9, which is not a freeway, so no collision.\n\nBut during the path, from turn t_1 to turn t_1 + H -2, we might be on freeways y=1 to 8, and we need to avoid collision at those turns.\n\nCollision at turn T for T from t_1 to t_1 + H -2 if y_T between 1 and 8 and collision condition.\n\nAt turn t_1 + H -1, y=9, no issue.\n\nStart at turn 1, y=1.\n\nWe need to find actions to get to y=9 at some turn.\n\nMinimal H.\n\nFirst, let's find the car positions over time.\n\nSet t1=1.\n\nFor a car, at time T, span depends on T - t1 = T - 1.\n\nLet delta_t = T - t1 = T - 1.\n\nThen for a right-moving car with span at t1 [τ, h], speed s, span at T: [τ + s * delta_t, h + s * delta_t]\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but all cars here are right-moving, I think. In the data, all are right direction.\n\nIn freeway 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 all cars have direction right.\n\nNo left-moving cars, all right-moving.\n\nSo for any car, at time T, span is [τ + s*(T-1), h + s*(T-1)]\n\nAnd we care about whether 0 is in this interval for the freeway we are on at turn T.\n\nNow, for each freeway, list the cars and when 0 is in their span.\n\nFirst, freeway y=1 at turn T.\n\nFreeway 1 has three cars:\n\nCar A: τ=-55, h=-44, s=4\n\nSpan at T: [-55 + 4*(T-1), -44 + 4*(T-1)]\n\n0 in span when min <= 0 <= max, so -55 +4(T-1) <= 0 <= -44 +4(T-1)\n\nSince the car is moving right, min and max increase.\n\nSet L(T) = -55 + 4(T-1)\n\nH(T) = -44 + 4(T-1)\n\n0 in [L(T), H(T)] iff L(T) <= 0 <= H(T)\n\nL(T) <= 0: -55 +4(T-1) <= 0 => 4(T-1) <= 55 => T-1 <= 13.75 => T <= 14.75, so T <= 14 since T integer\n\nH(T) >= 0: -44 +4(T-1) >=0 => 4(T-1) >=44 => T-1 >=11 => T >=12\n\nSo for T=12 to 14 inclusive, 0 in span for this car.\n\nSimilarly, car B: τ=-19, h=-8, s=4\n\nL(T) = -19 +4(T-1)\n\nH(T) = -8 +4(T-1)\n\n0 in [L,H] iff L<=0 and H>=0\n\nL<=0: -19+4(T-1) <=0 => 4(T-1) <=19 => T-1 <=4.75 => T<=5.75, so T<=5\n\nH>=0: -8+4(T-1) >=0 => 4(T-1) >=8 => T-1 >=2 => T>=3\n\nSo for T=3,4,5\n\nCar C: τ=17, h=28, s=4\n\nL(T)=17+4(T-1)\n\nH(T)=28+4(T-1)\n\nL(T) =17+4(T-1) >0 for all T>=1, since 17>0, and increasing.\n\nH(T)>0, so 0 in span only if L(T) <=0 <= H(T), but L(T) >=17>0, so 0 < L(T) <= H(T), so 0 not <= H(T) when L(T)>0, actually since L(T) >0, 0 < L(T), so 0 not in [L,H] because L>0.\n\nSo for car C, 0 never in span, since min position is 17 at T=1, increasing.\n\nSo on freeway 1, collision when either car A or car B has 0 in span.\n\nCar A: T=12,13,14\n\nCar B: T=3,4,5\n\nCar C: never.\n\nSo at turn T, on freeway 1, collision if T=3,4,5 or T=12,13,14.\n\nNow freeway 2: one car: τ=49, h=60, s=12\n\nL(T) =49 +12(T-1)\n\nH(T)=60+12(T-1)\n\nL(T) >0 for all T>=1, since 49>0, increasing, so 0 never in span. No collision on freeway 2 ever.\n\nFreeway 3: one car: same as car A on freeway 1: τ=-55, h=-44, s=4\n\nSo span at T: [-55+4(T-1), -44+4(T-1)]\n\n0 in span for T=12,13,14, same as above.\n\nFreeway 4: three cars, same as freeway 1: car A, B, C types.\n\nCar A: [-55,-44] at T=1, collision T=12,13,14\n\nCar B: [-19,-8] at T=1, collision T=3,4,5\n\nCar C: [17,28], no collision\n\nSo same as freeway 1: collision at T=3,4,5 or 12,13,14\n\nSimilarly freeway 5: same as freeway 1 and 4.\n\nFreeway 6: same.\n\nFreeway 7: one car: same as car A: [-55,-44], s=4, collision at T=12,13,14\n\nFreeway 8: one car: same, collision at T=12,13,14\n\nNow, summary for each freeway when collision occurs at x=0:\n\n- y=1: collision at T=3,4,5 and T=12,13,14\n\n- y=2: no collision ever\n\n- y=3: collision at T=12,13,14\n\n- y=4: collision at T=3,4,5 and T=12,13,14\n\n- y=5: collision at T=3,4,5 and T=12,13,14\n\n- y=6: collision at T=3,4,5 and T=12,13,14\n\n- y=7: collision at T=12,13,14\n\n- y=8: collision at T=12,13,14\n\nNow, player starts at turn T=1, y=1.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nAt each turn, we choose action: U, D, or S, changing y by +1, -1, or 0.\n\ny must be integer between 0 and 9.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at some turn, say T_end, with T_end = t1 + H -1 = 1 + H -1 = H.\n\nSet T_start = t1 =1.\n\nWe need to have y_T =9 at T = T_end, where T_end = t1 + H -1 = 1 + H -1 = H.\n\nH is the number of turns, actions from T=1 to T=H.\n\nAt turn T=H, position y_H =9.\n\nAnd T_end = H.\n\nNow, during turns T=1 to T=H-1, we are on some y between 0 and 8, and if y between 1 and 8, we need no collision at that turn.\n\nAt turn T, position y_T, if y_T in 1-8, then no car collision on that freeway at turn T.\n\nAlso, we start at T=1, y=1.\n\nNow, minimal H, so we want to reach y=9 as fast as possible.\n\nThe direct way: move up every turn.\n\nStart T=1, y=1.\n\nAction a_1 = U, then y_2 = y1 +1 =1+1=2\n\nAt T=1, y=1, which is freeway, need to check collision.\n\nAt T=1, for y=1, is there collision?\n\nFrom above, y=1 has collision at T=3,4,5 and 12,13,14. T=1 not in, so no collision at T=1.\n\nThen a1=U, y2=2\n\nT=2, y=2, freeway 2.\n\nFreeway 2 has no collision ever, so safe.\n\na2=U, y3=3\n\nT=3, y=3, freeway 3.\n\nFreeway 3 has collision at T=12,13,14, T=3 not in, so no collision? T=3 for y=3.\n\ny=3 collision at T=12,13,14 only, so at T=3, no collision.\n\nBut y=3 collision only at T=12,13,14, so at T=3, safe.\n\nThen a3=U, y4=4\n\nT=4, y=4, freeway 4.\n\nFreeway 4 has collision at T=3,4,5 and 12,13,14.\n\nT=4 is in 3,4,5? T=4, yes, collision at T=4 for y=4.\n\nOh, collision if we are on y=4 at T=4.\n\nBecause at T=4, on freeway 4, car B has 0 in span.\n\nSo if we go up directly, at T=4, y=4, collision.\n\nNot good.\n\nSo we need to avoid that.\n\nPerhaps stay or move down at some point.\n\nSince we need minimal H, we should go up as much as possible, but avoid being on dangerous positions.\n\nList the dangerous (y,T) pairs where if on y at T, collision.\n\nFrom above:\n\nFor y=1: dangerous at T=3,4,5 and T=12,13,14\n\ny=2: never dangerous\n\ny=3: dangerous at T=12,13,14\n\ny=4: dangerous at T=3,4,5 and T=12,13,14\n\ny=5: same, T=3,4,5 and 12,13,14\n\ny=6: same, T=3,4,5 and 12,13,14\n\ny=7: dangerous at T=12,13,14\n\ny=8: dangerous at T=12,13,14\n\nNow, the critical part is around T=3,4,5 for y=4,5,6 and also y=1 at that time, but y=1 is also dangerous at T=3,4,5.\n\ny=1 dangerous T=3,4,5.\n\nSimilarly, later at T=12-14, many y dangerous.\n\nBut since we start early, T=1, and we want minimal H, probably H small, so we can avoid the early danger and reach before T=12.\n\nT=12 is far, so let's first try to reach y=9 quickly, avoiding T=3,4,5 on affected y.\n\nStart T=1, y=1.\n\nAt T=1, y=1 is safe (not dangerous).\n\nOptions: we can go U, D, or S.\n\nIf S, y2=1, same position.\n\nBut we need to go up, so S might waste time.\n\nD to y=0, but y=0 not freeway, safe, but then we need to come back, might take more turns.\n\nSimilarly, U to y=2.\n\ny=2 is always safe.\n\nSo better to go up.\n\nSo at T=1, action U, y2=2.\n\nT=2, y=2, safe, as y=2 no danger.\n\nNow at T=2, we can go U, D, or S.\n\nIf U, y3=3.\n\nT=3, y=3.\n\ny=3 dangerous only at T=12,13,14, so at T=3 safe.\n\nThen if U, y4=4, but at T=4, y=4 dangerous, collision.\n\nSo we cannot go directly to y=4 at T=4.\n\nAt T=2, y=2, we could choose to not go up immediately.\n\nFor example, at T=2, we could stay S, so y3=2.\n\nThen at T=3, y=2, safe.\n\nThen at T=3, we can go U to y4=3? Let's see.\n\nT=3, action, if we go U, y4 = y3 +1 =2+1=3? Position at turn T.\n\nAt turn T=2, y2=2.\n\nAction a2: if S, then y3=2.\n\nThen at T=3, y=2, safe.\n\nThen a3: if U, y4=3.\n\nThen T=4, y=3.\n\ny=3 dangerous at T=12,13,14, not at T=4, so safe.\n\nThen a4: if U, y5=4.\n\nT=5, y=4.\n\ny=4 dangerous at T=3,4,5, so T=5 is dangerous, collision if on y=4 at T=5.\n\nBecause T=5 is in 3,4,5 for y=4.\n\nSo if we go to y=4 at T=5, collision.\n\nNot good.\n\nAt T=4, y=3, instead of going U, we could stay or go down.\n\nBut we need to go up.\n\nPerhaps at some point go down to avoid.\n\nSince y=2 is always safe, we can stay there for a while.\n\nBut we need to go to y=9.\n\nAnother idea: go to y=0 or something.\n\ny=0 is not freeway, always safe.\n\nSimilarly y=9 safe.\n\nBut let's think about the dangerous times.\n\nThe danger at T=3,4,5 for y=4,5,6 and also y=1.\n\ny=1 is dangerous at T=3,4,5, but we are at y=2 at T=3 if we stayed or something.\n\nStart:\n\nT=1, y=1, safe. Action U, y2=2\n\nT=2, y=2, safe. Now instead of going to y=3 at T=3, we can stay at y=2 for one turn.\n\nAction at T=2: S, so a2=S, y3=2\n\nT=3, y=2, safe (y=2 always safe)\n\nAction at T=3: U, so a3=U, y4=3\n\nT=4, y=3, safe (y=3 dangerous only at T=12-14, not now)\n\nNow at T=4, y=3, we want to go to y=4, but at T=5, if we go to y=4, T=5 y=4 dangerous.\n\nSo we need to not be on y=4 at T=5.\n\nSimilarly, if we go to y=5 at T=5, also dangerous, since y=5 dangerous T=3,4,5.\n\ny=6 also.\n\nSo at T=4, y=3, we can:\n\n- Go U to y5=4, but then at T=5 y=4 dangerous, collision.\n\n- Go S to y5=3, then at T=5 y=3, safe.\n\n- Go D to y5=2, safe.\n\nIf we stay at y=3, then at T=5, y=3 safe.\n\nThen at T=5, we can go U to y6=4.\n\nT=6, y=4.\n\nNow, y=4 dangerous at T=3,4,5, but T=6 >5, so for y=4, danger only up to T=5, at T=6, is it safe?\n\nFor y=4, collision at T=3,4,5 only? From earlier, for y=4, car B danger T=3,4,5, car A danger T=12,13,14, so at T=6, no danger for y=4.\n\nSimilarly, T=6 is not 3,4,5 nor 12-14, so safe.\n\nThen at T=6, y=4, we can go U to y7=5.\n\nT=7, y=5.\n\ny=5 dangerous at T=3,4,5, T=7>5, and next danger T=12, so safe.\n\nThen U to y8=6, T=8, y=6.\n\nSimilarly, safe at T=8.\n\nThen U to y9=7, T=9, y=7.\n\ny=7 dangerous at T=12,13,14, not T=9, safe.\n\nU to y10=8, T=10, y=8.\n\nSimilarly, safe.\n\nU to y11=9, T=11, y=9, which is the goal.\n\nAt T=11, y=9, we are at the position, and since it's not freeway, no collision, and we reached.\n\nNow, let's list the actions and turns.\n\nStart T=1, y=1, action a1: we took U, so y2=2\n\nT=2, y=2, action a2: we took S (stay), so y3=2\n\nT=3, y=2, action a3: U, so y4=3\n\nT=4, y=3, action a4: S (stay), so y5=3? In my plan, at T=4, I said stay or something.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nAfter T=4, y=3, we need to not go to y=4 at T=5, so at T=4, we should not go U, because if a4=U, y5=4, then T=5 y=4 collision.\n\nSo at T=4, we should stay or go down.\n\nIf we stay, a4=S, then y5=3\n\nT=5, y=3, safe.\n\nThen a5=U, y6=4\n\nT=6, y=4, safe (as above)\n\nThen a6=U, y7=5\n\nT=7, y=5, safe\n\na7=U, y8=6\n\nT=8, y=6, safe\n\na8=U, y9=7\n\nT=9, y=7, safe\n\na9=U, y10=8\n\nT=10, y=8, safe\n\na10=U, y11=9\n\nT=11, y=9, reached.\n\nNow, how many turns? Actions from T=1 to T=10, that's 10 actions.\n\nT=1 to T=10, actions at 10 turns, but H is the number, and we reach at T=11.\n\nT_start =1, after H actions, at turn T=1+H, position y_{1+H}\n\nWe need y_{t1 + H -1} = y_{1 + H -1} =9\n\nt1 + H -1 = H, since t1=1.\n\nSet T_end = t1 + H -1 =1 + H -1 =H\n\ny_{T_end} = y_H =9\n\nIn the sequence, actions at times t=1 to t=H-1? No.\n\nThe actions are for t from t1 to t1 + H -1, so times 1,2,3,..., up to time H-1? Let's index.\n\nThe sequence {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, so for t=0, a_{t1} = a_1\n\nt=1, a_{t1+1}=a_2\n\n...\n\nt=H-1, a_{t1 + H -1} = a_{1 + H -1} = a_H\n\nActions at times: 1, 2, 3, ..., H\n\nTimes from 1 to H.\n\nThen after action at time H, position at time H+1 is set.\n\nBut we need position at time t1 + H -1 = 1 + H -1 = H to be 9.\n\ny_H =9.\n\nIn the state, at turn H, position y_H=9.\n\nIn terms of turns: at turn 1, we have y1, take action a1, go to y2.\n\nAt turn 2, y2, take a2, go to y3, ..., at turn k, y_k, take a_k, go to y_{k+1}.\n\nWe need at some turn M, y_M =9.\n\nAnd M = t1 + H -1 = H.\n\nSo y_H =9.\n\nThe actions are taken from turn 1 to turn H-1? No.\n\nWhen we take action at turn T, it affects y_{T+1}.\n\nTo have y_H =9, we need to have taken actions from turn 1 to turn H-1, which set y2 to y_H.\n\nSpecifically, y1 is given, then a1 determines y2, a2 determines y3, ..., a_{H-1} determines y_H.\n\nThen at turn H, we have y_H=9, and no action is taken at turn H, I think, or we don't need action since we reached.\n\nThe sequence of actions is for turns t1 to t1+H-1, which is turn 1 to turn H.\n\nBut action at turn H would affect y_{H+1}, but we don't care, since we reached at turn H.\n\nIn the definition, the sequence is {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, so a_{1} to a_{1+H-1} = a_H.\n\nActions at times: 1,2,3,...,H.\n\nFor each action at time t, it determines y_{t+1}.\n\nSo after action at time t, y_{t+1} is set.\n\nAt time t=H, we take action a_H, which would set y_{H+1}, but we need y_H=9 at turn H.\n\ny_H is the position at turn H, which is set by previous actions.\n\nTo have y_H=9, we need the actions from t=1 to t=H-1 to set y_H.\n\nSpecifically, y1 is given.\n\na1 at t=1 sets y2\n\na2 at t=2 sets y3\n\n...\n\na_{k} at t=k sets y_{k+1}\n\nSo for y_H to be set, it is set by a_{H-1} at turn H-1.\n\nThen at turn H, we have position y_H, and if we take action a_H, it sets y_{H+1}, but since we reached y_H=9, we don't need to take action, but the sequence includes actions up to a_H.\n\nIn the task, the sequence has H actions, from a_{t1} to a_{t1+H-1}, and after that, at turn t1 + H -1, position is (0,9).\n\nt1 + H -1 = 1 + H -1 = H.\n\nPosition at turn H is (0,9).\n\nNow, position at turn H is y_H, which depends on the actions taken before.\n\ny_H is determined by the actions from turn 1 to turn H-1.\n\nSpecifically, y_H = y1 + sum of Δy from t=1 to t=H-1.\n\ny_k for k>1 is determined by previous actions.\n\nAt turn H, we have y_H, and we don't take an action that affects it; the action at turn H affects y_{H+1}, which we don't care.\n\nIn the sequence, for the last action, when we reach, we may not need to take action, but the sequence specifies actions up to turn t1+H-1, which for us is turn H.\n\nBut if at turn H we take an action, it changes y_{H+1}, but y_H is already set.\n\nTo have y_H=9, we need that the position at turn H is 9, which is set by actions up to turn H-1.\n\nThen at turn H, we might take an action, but since we reached, we can take S or something, but it doesn't affect y_H.\n\nIn the collision, at turn H, if y_H=9, no collision.\n\nBut during turns 1 to H-1, we need to avoid collision when on freeway.\n\nIn my earlier plan, I have:\n\nStart T=1, y=1\n\na1=U, so y2=2\n\nT=2, y=2\n\na2=S, so y3=2  (stayed)\n\nT=3, y=2\n\na3=U, so y4=3\n\nT=4, y=3\n\na4=S, so y5=3  (stayed)\n\nT=5, y=3\n\na5=U, so y6=4\n\nT=6, y=4\n\na6=U, so y7=5\n\nT=7, y=5\n\na7=U, so y8=6\n\nT=8, y=6\n\na8=U, so y9=7\n\nT=9, y=7\n\na9=U, so y10=8\n\nT=10, y=8\n\na10=U, so y11=9\n\nAt T=11, y=11? y11=9\n\nPosition at turn T=11 is y11=9.\n\nWe need position at turn H to be 9, so H=11.\n\ny_H = y11=9, so H=11.\n\nActions from turn 1 to turn 10? The sequence has actions at t=1 to t=H.\n\nH=11, actions at t=1 to t=11.\n\nBut at t=11, we take a11, which sets y12, but we don't care.\n\nIn the position, at turn H=11, y11=9.\n\nNow, in the actions, we have a1 to a10 to set the path to y11=9.\n\na11 is extra, but we can set a11=S, for example.\n\nNow, check collision during the path.\n\nT=1, y=1: not dangerous, safe\n\nT=2, y=2: always safe\n\nT=3, y=2: safe\n\nT=4, y=3: y=3 dangerous only at T=12-14, T=4 safe\n\nT=5, y=3: safe\n\nT=6, y=4: y=4 dangerous at T=3,4,5, T=6 not, safe\n\nT=7, y=5: dangerous at T=3,4,5, T=7 not, safe\n\nT=8, y=6: dangerous at T=3,4,5, T=8 not, safe\n\nT=9, y=7: dangerous at T=12-14, T=9 not, safe\n\nT=10, y=8: dangerous at T=12-14, T=10 not, safe\n\nT=11, y=9: not freeway, safe\n\nAll good.\n\nH=11 turns? Actions from 1 to 10 set y2 to y11, with y11=9.\n\nThen at turn 11, we have position, and we need to include action for turn 11.\n\nSince we reached at turn 11, action a11 can be anything, say S.\n\nMinimal H: is this minimal?\n\nDirect up would be: a1=U, y2=2; a2=U, y3=3; a3=U, y4=4; but at T=4, y=4 collision, not possible.\n\nIf we go slower.\n\nFor example, at T=1, U to y2=2\n\nT=2, instead of U, we stay or down, but down to y=1, which at T=3 might be dangerous? y=1 dangerous at T=3,4,5.\n\nAt T=2, y=2, if we go D, a2=D, y3=1\n\nThen T=3, y=1, which is dangerous at T=3, collision.\n\nNot good.\n\nIf we go to y=0.\n\nT=1, U to y2=2\n\nT=2, D to y3=1? y3= y2 + (-1) if D, so y3=1\n\nT=3, y=1, dangerous.\n\nT=2, D to y3=1, but T=3 y=1 collision.\n\nIf T=2, S, y3=2\n\nThen T=3, y=2, safe.\n\nThen we can go U at T=3 to y4=3\n\nT=4, y=3, safe.\n\nThen at T=4, if U to y5=4, T=5 y=4 collision.\n\nIf at T=4, we go D to y5=2, for example.\n\nT=5, y=2, safe.\n\nThen at T=5, U to y6=3\n\nT=6, y=3, safe\n\nU to y7=4, T=7 y=4 safe, and so on.\n\nBut this takes more turns: from T=5 y=2 to y=9, need 7 up moves, so to y9 at T=12 or something.\n\nWorse than before.\n\nIn my first plan, I used two stays, at T=2 and T=4, to avoid the danger times.\n\nH=11, with y11=9.\n\nBut can we do with less?\n\nFor example, if we can go faster but skip the dangerous spots.\n\nSince y=2 is always safe, we could go directly to y=2 and stay until after T=5.\n\nFor example:\n\nT=1, y=1, a1=U, y2=2\n\nT=2, y=2, a2=S, y3=2\n\nT=3, y=2, a3=S, y4=2  (stay again)\n\nT=4, y=2, a4=U, y5=3\n\nBut at T=5, y=3? y5=3\n\nT=5, y=3, which is safe, since y=3 dangerous only later.\n\nThen a5=U, y6=4\n\nT=6, y=4, safe as before.\n\nThen continue up.\n\nBut we stayed extra at T=3, so now to reach y=9, let's see.\n\ny6=4 at T=6\n\na6=U, y7=5\n\nT=7, y=5\n\na7=U, y8=6\n\nT=8, y=6\n\na8=U, y9=7\n\nT=9, y=7\n\na9=U, y10=8\n\nT=10, y=8\n\na10=U, y11=9\n\nT=11, y=9 same as before.\n\nBut we have an extra stay at T=3, so we are at y=2 longer, but still reach at T=11.\n\nIn first plan, we had y4=3 at T=4, but stayed to avoid y=4 at T=5.\n\nIn the first sequence: after a3=U at T=3, y4=3 at T=4\n\nThen a4=S at T=4, y5=3 at T=5\n\nThen a5=U at T=5, y6=4 at T=6\n\nIn the sequence with extra stay: y3=2 at T=3 (after a2=S at T=2? Let's not confuse.\n\nFirst plan:\n\nT=1: y1=1, a1=U, y2=2\n\nT=2: y2=2, a2=S, y3=2\n\nT=3: y3=2, a3=U, y4=3\n\nT=4: y4=3, a4=S, y5=3\n\nT=5: y5=3, a5=U, y6=4\n\n...\n\nUp to a10=U, y11=9 at T=11.\n\nAlternative: at T=2, instead of staying, go up to y3=3.\n\nBut at T=3, y=3 is safe, but then if we go to y4=4 at T=4, collision.\n\nSo we must not be on y=4 at T=4 or T=5.\n\nSimilarly, cannot be on y=5 at T=5, etc.\n\nSo we need to delay reaching y=4 until after T=5.\n\nIn the first plan, we reach y=4 at T=6, which is safe.\n\nWe could reach earlier if we go to higher y but avoid.\n\nFor example, from y=3 at T=4, instead of staying, go down to y=2, but that might not help.\n\nOr go directly to y=6 or something, but we can only move one step.\n\nAnother idea: since y=2 is safe, and at T=4, if we are at y=2, we can go up to y=3 at T=5? Let's see.\n\nStart: T=1, y=1, a1=U, y2=2\n\nT=2, y=2, a2=U, y3=3  (go up immediately)\n\nT=3, y=3, safe\n\nNow at T=3, we need to set y4.\n\nIf a3=S, y4=3\n\nThen T=4, y=3, safe\n\nThen a4=U, y5=4, but T=5 y=4 collision.\n\nIf at T=3, a3=D, y4=2\n\nThen T=4, y=2, safe\n\na4=U, y5=3\n\nT=5, y=3, safe\n\na5=U, y6=4\n\nT=6, y=4, safe, same as before.\n\nBut we wasted a move down and up, so it takes more turns to reach y=9.\n\nFor example, from y6=4 at T=6, to y9, need 5 up moves, to T=11 again.\n\ny6=4 at T=6, a6=U, y7=5 T=7, ..., up to a10=U, y11=9 T=11.\n\nSame as before.\n\nCan we reach before T=11?\n\nFor example, if we can be at y=4 at T=6, but y=4 at T=6 is fine, but to reach y=9 faster, we need to move up continuously except for the delays.\n\nThe minimal time: from y=1 to y=9, need 8 up moves.\n\nEach up move increases y by 1.\n\nBut we may have stay or down moves.\n\nTo minimize H, we want to minimize the number of non-up moves.\n\nIn the path, we start at y=1, end at y=9, so net change +8, so number of U minus number of D should be 8.\n\nEach U: +1, D: -1, S: 0.\n\nLet U_count, D_count, S_count.\n\ny_final = y_initial + U_count - D_count = 1 + U_count - D_count =9, so U_count - D_count =8.\n\nTotal actions: H = U_count + D_count + S_count.\n\nWe want to minimize H, so minimize S_count + D_count, since U_count =8 + D_count.\n\nH = U_count + D_count + S_count = (8 + D_count) + D_count + S_count = 8 + 2 D_count + S_count.\n\nTo minimize H, we need to minimize D_count and S_count, ideally both 0.\n\nBut with D_count=0 and S_count=0, H=8, but direct up has collision at T=4.\n\nWith S_count=2 and D_count=0, H=10, as in my first plan: U_count=8, D_count=0, S_count=2, H=10.\n\nIn my sequence, actions: a1=U, a2=S, a3=U, a4=S, a5=U, a6=U, a7=U, a8=U, a9=U, a10=U.\n\nSo U: 8 times (a1,a3,a5,a6,a7,a8,a9,a10), that's 8 U.\n\nS: 2 times (a2 and a4)\n\nD: 0\n\nH=10 actions.\n\nThen y at turn 11 is 9.\n\nWith H=10, y_H = y_{10} =? t1 + H -1 =1+10-1=10, y_{10}=9.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t=1 to t=10.\n\nAfter a10, y11 is set, but we need y at turn t1+H-1=10.\n\nt1+H-1=1+10-1=10, so y_{10}=9.\n\nIn my sequence: let's list positions.\n\nT=1: y1=1\n\na1=U, y2=2\n\nT=2: y2=2\n\na2=S, y3=2\n\nT=3: y3=2\n\na3=U, y4=3\n\nT=4: y4=3\n\na4=S, y5=3\n\nT=5: y5=3\n\na5=U, y6=4\n\nT=6: y6=4\n\na6=U, y7=5\n\nT=7: y7=5\n\na7=U, y8=6\n\nT=8: y8=6\n\na8=U, y9=7\n\nT=9: y9=7\n\na9=U, y10=8\n\nT=10: y10=8? We need y_{10}=9.\n\nProblem.\n\ny_{10} at T=10 is 8, but we need y_{10}=9.\n\nInconsistency.\n\nt1+H-1=10, y_{10} should be 9.\n\nBut in the sequence, at T=10, y10=8.\n\nThen we need to go up to y11=9 at T=11.\n\nBut T=11 is later.\n\nTo have y_{10}=9, we need to reach earlier.\n\nFor example, if we have less stays.\n\nIn the path above, with two stays, we have y10=8 at T=10, but we need y10=9.\n\nSo we must reach by T=10.\n\nThus, we need to save one turn.\n\nPerhaps we can have only one stay.\n\nFor example, avoid being at y=4 at T=4 or T=5.\n\nAt T=4, if we are not on y=4 or y=5.\n\nSince we start from below.\n\nT=1, y=1\n\na1=U, y2=2\n\nT=2, y=2\n\nNow, at T=2, if we go U, a2=U, y3=3\n\nT=3, y=3, safe\n\nThen at T=3, we cannot go U because y4=4 at T=4 collision.\n\nSo we must do something else at T=3.\n\nIf we go S, a3=S, y4=3\n\nT=4, y=3, safe\n\nThen at T=4, go U, a4=U, y5=4\n\nT=5, y=4, but T=5 dangerous for y=4, collision.\n\nIf at T=4, go D, a4=D, y5=2\n\nT=5, y=2, safe, but then we are at y=2, need to go up again.\n\nWorse.\n\nAt T=3, go D, a3=D, y4=2\n\nT=4, y=2, safe\n\na4=U, y5=3\n\nT=5, y=3, safe\n\na5=U, y6=4\n\nT=6, y=4, safe\n\nThen a6=U, y7=5\n\n...\n\nTo reach y=9: from y6=4 at T=6, need 5 up to y11=9 at T=11, but we need y at T=10.\n\ny6=4 at T=6, a6=U, y7=5 T=7, a7=U, y8=6 T=8, a8=U, y9=7 T=9, a9=U, y10=8 T=10, y10=8, not 9.\n\nStill y10=8.\n\nTo have y10=9, we need to be at higher y earlier.\n\nFor example, start by going up faster but avoid the collision point.\n\nAt T=1, y=1, instead of U, go S or D.\n\nIf S, a1=S, y2=1\n\nT=2, y=1, but at T=2, y=1, is it dangerous? y=1 dangerous at T=3,4,5, T=2 not, so safe.\n\nThen a2=U, y3=2\n\nT=3, y=2, safe\n\na3=U, y4=3\n\nT=4, y=3, safe\n\na4=U, y5=4 but T=5 y=4 collision.\n\nSame problem.\n\nIf at T=1, go D to y=0.\n\na1=D, y2=0\n\nT=2, y=0, safe, not freeway.\n\nThen a2=U, y3=1\n\nT=3, y=1, but y=1 dangerous at T=3, collision.\n\nNot good.\n\na2=S, y3=0, T=3 y=0 safe, then a3=U, y4=1, T=4 y=1, dangerous? y=1 dangerous T=3,4,5, T=4 yes, collision.\n\nIf we stay at y=0 until after T=5.\n\nT=1, a1=D, y2=0\n\nT=2, y=0, a2=S, y3=0\n\nT=3, y=0, a3=S, y4=0\n\nT=4, y=0, a4=S, y5=0\n\nT=5, y=0, a5=U, y6=1\n\nT=6, y=1, now y=1 dangerous at T=12,13,14, not T=6, safe.\n\nThen a6=U, y7=2\n\nT=7, y=2 safe\n\na7=U, y8=3\n\nT=8, y=3 safe\n\na8=U, y9=4\n\nT=9, y=4 safe\n\na9=U, y10=5\n\nT=10, y10=5, but we need y10=9, not reached.\n\nThen need more actions, H larger.\n\nNot better.\n\nSo back to the first plan, but we need to reach y=9 at turn 10.\n\nWith two stays, we have y10=8 at T=10.\n\nSo to have y10=9, we need one less stay or one less down.\n\nBut with D_count=0, we need S_count=1? Then U_count=8, S_count=1, H=9, then y at turn t1+H-1=1+9-1=9 should be 9.\n\ny9=9.\n\nCan we achieve with only one stay?\n\nStart T=1, y=1, a1=U, y2=2\n\nT=2, y=2, now if we go U, a2=U, y3=3\n\nT=3, y=3, safe\n\nAt T=3, we cannot go U, so we must S or D.\n\nIf S, a3=S, y4=3\n\nT=4, y=3, safe\n\nThen a4=U, y5=4, T=5 y=4 collision.\n\nIf at T=3, D, a3=D, y4=2\n\nT=4, y=2, safe\n\na4=U, y5=3\n\nT=5, y=3, safe\n\na5=U, y6=4\n\nT=6, y=4, safe\n\nThen to y9=9: a6=U, y7=5; a7=U, y8=6; a8=U, y9=7; a9=U, y10=8; not 9.\n\ny9=7 at T=9, need y9=9? For H=9, y_{9} should be 9.\n\nBut here y9=7.\n\nNot enough.\n\nWith one stay at different point.\n\nSuppose we go up to y=3 quickly but then stay to avoid.\n\nT=1, a1=U, y2=2\n\nT=2, a2=U, y3=3\n\nT=3, a3=S, y4=3\n\nT=4, y4=3, a4= something.\n\nIf a4=U, y5=4, T=5 collision.\n\nIf a4=S, y5=3, T=5 y=3 safe, but then a5=U, y6=4, T=6 y=4 safe, then y6=4 at T=6, need to go to y9=9 by T=9, but from y6=4 to y9=9, need 5 steps, but only 3 actions a6,a7,a8 to set y7,y8,y9.\n\ny6 at T=6, a6 sets y7, a7 sets y8, a8 sets y9.\n\nSo with three actions, we can increase y by at most 3, so y9 <= y6 +3 =4+3=7 <9, cannot reach y9=9 from y6=4 in 3 actions.\n\nImpossible.\n\nIf we are higher earlier, but we can't because of the danger.\n\nStart at y=1, to reach high y quickly but avoid T=4 and T=5 on y=4,5,6.\n\nBut y=4,5,6 dangerous only at T=3,4,5, so at T=1,2,6,7,... safe.\n\nAt T=1, y=1, if we go U, y2=2\n\nT=2, y=2, go U, y3=3\n\nBut at T=3, y=3 safe, but then we are stuck because we cannot go to y=4 at T=4 or T=5.\n\nUnless we go to y=6 directly, but we can only move one step.\n\nAnother idea: since y=2 is safe, we can go to y=2 and then at T=4 go up to y=3, etc.\n\nBut T=4 y=3 safe, T=5 y=4 dangerous.\n\nSo we need to be at y=3 at T=5 or something.\n\nLet's list the safe positions.\n\nFor turn T=1: y=1 safe, y=2 safe, y=3 safe, etc. except the dangerous.\n\nAt T=1: all y safe except if on dangerous, but y=1 not dangerous at T=1.\n\nT=1: y=1 safe, y=2 safe, y=3 safe, y=4 dangerous? y=4 dangerous at T=3,4,5, not T=1, so all safe at T=1.\n\nSimilarly T=2: all safe, since y=4 dangerous only T=3,4,5, etc.\n\nT=3: y=1 dangerous, y=4 dangerous, y=5 dangerous, y=6 dangerous? y=6 dangerous at T=3,4,5.\n\ny=2 safe, y=3 safe (since danger only later), y=7 safe, etc.\n\nSpecifically:\n\nAt T=3: dangerous y: 1,4,5,6 (from above, y=1 T=3, y=4 T=3, y=5 T=3, y=6 T=3)\n\nSafe y: 2,3,7,8\n\ny=3 is safe at T=3, as established.\n\nSimilarly T=4: dangerous y:1,4,5,6\n\nSafe y:2,3,7,8\n\nT=5: dangerous y:1,4,5,6\n\nSafe y:2,3,7,8\n\nT=6: all safe except later dangers not yet.\n\netc.\n\nNow, to reach y=9 quickly.\n\nStart T=1, y=1 safe, a1=U, y2=2\n\nT=2, y=2 safe, a2=U, y3=3\n\nT=3, y=3 safe (since not dangerous)\n\nNow at T=3, we need to choose action for y4.\n\nWe want y4 such that at T=4, it is safe.\n\nAt T=4, safe y are 2,3,7,8.\n\nBut from y3=3, we can go to y4=2,3, or4.\n\ny4=2: safe\n\ny4=3: safe\n\ny4=4: dangerous\n\nSo we can go to y4=3 or y4=2.\n\nIf we go to y4=3, a3=S, y4=3\n\nThen T=4, y=3 safe.\n\nThen at T=4, for y5, at T=5, safe y are 2,3,7,8.\n\nFrom y4=3, we can go to y5=2,3,4.\n\ny5=2: safe\n\ny5=3: safe\n\ny5=4: dangerous\n\nSo go to y5=3 or 2.\n\nIf y5=3, a4=S, y5=3\n\nThen T=5, y=3 safe.\n\nThen at T=5, a5=U, y6=4\n\nT=6, y=4 safe (since danger only at T=3,4,5 for y=4)\n\nThen proceed up.\n\nBut y6=4 at T=6, then to y9=9, need a6=U y7=5, a7=U y8=6, a8=U y9=7, a9=U y10=8, not 9.\n\nFor H=9, y9=9 needed.\n\nFrom above, at T=5, y=3, if we could be higher.\n\nBut at T=3, we are at y=3, and we stayed or went down, so not higher.\n\nAt T=3, from y3=3, instead of staying, we could go to y=7 or 8, but impossible, only adjacent move.\n\nSo cannot.\n\nPerhaps start by not going up immediately.\n\nFor example, T=1, a1=S, y2=1\n\nT=2, y=1, at T=2, y=1 safe? T=2 not dangerous for y=1, yes.\n\nThen a2=U, y3=2\n\nT=3, y=2 safe\n\na3=U, y4=3\n\nT=4, y=3 safe\n\na4=U, y5=4 but T=5 collision? y5=4 at T=5 dangerous.\n\nSame.\n\nIf at T=4, we go U, but to avoid y=4 at T=5.\n\nNot possible.\n\nSo it seems we cannot reach before T=11 with y10=9? Earlier I had a sequence with H=10, y10=8.\n\nTo have y10=9, we need to start from higher or something.\n\nAnother idea: use down move to be at safe spot faster, but down might not help.\n\nFor example, T=1, a1=U, y2=2\n\nT=2, a2=U, y3=3\n\nT=3, a3=D, y4=2\n\nT=4, y4=2, safe\n\na4=U, y5=3\n\nT=5, y5=3, safe\n\na5=U, y6=4\n\nT=6, y6=4, safe\n\na6=U, y7=5\n\na7=U, y8=6\n\na8=U, y9=7\n\na9=U, y10=8\n\ny10=8 at T=10.\n\nStill not 9.\n\nTo reach y9=9 at T=9, we need y9=9.\n\nFrom above, at T=6, y6=4, then with a6,a7,a8 to set y7,y8,y9, max y9=4+3=7.\n\nIf we can be at y=6 at T=6, for example.\n\nBut at T=3, we are at y=3, to be at y=6 at T=6, we need three up moves, but at T=4 and T=5, we cannot be on y=4 or y=5 if dangerous.\n\nAt T=4, if we go to y=4, dangerous, so we cannot be on y=4 at T=4.\n\nSimilarly, cannot be on y=5 at T=5 if dangerous.\n\nSo to go from y=3 at T=3 to y=6 at T=6, we need y4, y5, y6.\n\nAt T=4, y4 must be safe, so y4=3 or 2 or 7,8 but from y=3, only 2,3,4 possible, so y4=2 or 3.\n\nIf y4=3, then at T=5, y5 must be safe, from y4=3, y5=2,3,4, safe are 2,3, so y5=2 or 3.\n\nThen y6 from there, not 6.\n\nIf y4=2, then y5 from 2 can be 1,2,3.\n\nAt T=5, y=1 dangerous, so y5=2 or 3.\n\nThen y6=3 or 4, not 6.\n\nSo impossible to be at y=6 at T=6.\n\nSimilarly, cannot reach high y early with the danger zones.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 10 with y10=9 not possible; we need H=11 with y11=9.\n\nIn the first plan, with H=10 actions, we have y10=8 at T=10, then with a10=U, y11=9 at T=11, so for H=11, y11=9.\n\nAnd we have two stays.\n\nPerhaps we can have only one stay if we time differently.\n\nFor example, T=1, a1=U, y2=2\n\nT=2, a2=U, y3=3\n\nT=3, a3=S, y4=3  (stay at y=3)\n\nT=4, y4=3, now a4=U, but y5=4, T=5 collision.\n\nNot good.\n\nT=3, a3=D, y4=2\n\nT=4, a4=U, y5=3\n\nT=5, a5=U, y6=4\n\nThen same as before.\n\nNo savings.\n\nSo probably H=11 is minimal with the given constraints.\n\nNow for the sequence.\n\nIn the answer, we need to output the actions.\n\nWith H=11, actions from turn 1 to turn 11.\n\nBut at turn 11, action can be S, since we reached.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nTurn 1: U\n\nTurn 2: S\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: S\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: S  (or anything)\n\nBut at turn 10, action U sets y11=9.\n\nThen at turn 11, we are at y11=9, and we take action a11, which could be S, setting y12=9, but we don't care.\n\nIn the position, at turn t1+H-1=1+11-1=11, y11=9.\n\nNow, collision check: we have T=1 to T=10 for positions, T=11 is goal.\n\nIn the sequence above:\n\nT=1: y=1, safe\n\nT=2: y=2, safe\n\nT=3: y=2, safe\n\nT=4: y=3, safe\n\nT=5: y=3, safe\n\nT=6: y=4, safe\n\nT=7: y=5, safe\n\nT=8: y=6, safe\n\nT=9: y=7, safe\n\nT=10: y=8, safe\n\nAll good.\n\nAnd y11=9.\n\nNow, the actions are for each turn.\n\nIn the answer format:\n\nTurn 1: a_{1} = U\n\nTurn 2: a_{2} = S\n\nTurn 3: a_{3} = U\n\nTurn 4: a_{4} = S\n\nTurn 5: a_{5} = U\n\nTurn 6: a_{6} = U\n\nTurn 7: a_{7} = U\n\nTurn 8: a_{8} = U\n\nTurn 9: a_{9} = U\n\nTurn 10: a_{10} = U\n\nTurn 11: a_{11} = S  (say)\n\nBut since at turn 11, we reached, action doesn't matter.\n\nPerhaps we can have no action at turn 11, but the sequence should have H actions.\n\nIn the task, the sequence has H actions, so for H=11, 11 actions.\n\nIn the collision note, when moving, at turn T, if you move to different y, you are not on the new y until next turn, but in this case, we are only concerned with the position at each turn, not during move.\n\nI think we covered.\n\nTo save one action, but I think not possible.\n\nAnother thought: at the beginning, since we start at y=1, and it is safe at T=1, we can go up immediately.\n\nPerhaps at T=4, instead of staying, we can go down to y=2, but then we need to come back, wasting moves.\n\nNo benefit.\n\nSo I think H=11 is minimal.\n\nNow, for the car state, I think I have all.\n\nIn freeway 4,5,6, they have cars that are dangerous at T=3,4,5, but we avoided.\n\nAlso, later dangers at T=12-14, but we reach before, so fine.\n\nSo the sequence should be as above.\n\nNow, in the answer, list for each turn.\n\nBut turn t1=1, so:\n\nTurn 1: U\n\nTurn 2: S\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: S\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: S\n\nBut for turn 11, since we are at y=9, and action S is fine.\n\nWe can set turn 11 to U, but y12=10, but y must be <=9, so if y=9, U would be invalid? y must be in [0,9], so if y=9, U not possible, similarly D from y=0.\n\nIn the player update, y_{t+1} must be in [0,9], so action must be valid.\n\nAt y=9, we cannot go U, so action must be D or S.\n\nSimilarly at y=0, cannot go D.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 10, we are at y=8? In the position:\n\nAfter a10=U at turn 10, y11=9.\n\nAt turn 11, y11=9, so action a11 must be S or D.\n\nS is fine.\n\nSimilarly, in the path, no issue.\n\nTo make it cleaner, since we reached at turn 11, but we have to include action for turn 11.\n\nIn the sequence, turn 11 action S.\n\nNow, the minimal H is 11.\n\nBut let's confirm if we can reach with H=10.\n\nSuppose H=10, then y_{10} must be 9.\n\nWe need to go from y1=1 to y10=9 in 9 actions (from a1 to a9, since a1 to a9 set y2 to y10).\n\ny10 = y1 + sum_{t=1 to 9} Δy_t\n\ny10 =1 + (number of U - number of D) from t=1 to 9.\n\nSet to 9, so number of U minus number of D =8.\n\nWith 9 actions, U_count - D_count =8, and S_count + D_count + U_count =9.\n\nSince U_count =8 + D_count, then 8 + D_count + D_count + S_count =9, so 2 D_count + S_count =1.\n\nSo possible if D_count=0, S_count=1; or D_count=1, S_count=-1 impossible; or D_count=0, S_count=1; or D_count=1, S_count=-1 no.\n\n2 D_count + S_count =1, so either D_count=0, S_count=1; or D_count=1, S_count=-1 impossible; or D_count=0.5, no.\n\nSo only possibility: D_count=0, S_count=1, U_count=8.\n\nThen actions: 8 U, 1 S, 0 D.\n\nH=9 actions? H=10 for the sequence.\n\nFor H=10, sequence has 10 actions, from t=1 to t=10.\n\nThen y at turn t1+H-1=1+10-1=10 must be 9.\n\ny10=9.\n\ny10 is determined by a1 to a9.\n\ny10 = y1 + sum_{t=1 to 9} Δy_t\n\nSet to 9, with y1=1, so sum_{t=1 to9} Δy_t =8.\n\nΔy_t: U: +1, D: -1, S:0.\n\nSo sum = U_count - D_count =8.\n\nTotal actions from t=1 to 9: 9 actions.\n\nU_count + D_count + S_count =9.\n\nU_count - D_count =8.\n\nAdd: 2 U_count + S_count =17\n\nSubtract: 2 D_count - S_count = -7? Not integer, no issue.\n\nFrom U_count - D_count =8\n\nU_count + D_count + S_count =9\n\nSet D_count = d, S_count = s\n\nThen U_count = 8 + d\n\nThen (8+d) + d + s =9, so 8 + 2d + s =9, thus 2d + s =1.\n\nSince d and s non-negative integers, possible (d,s) = (0,1) or (1,-1) invalid, so only d=0, s=1.\n\nThen U_count =8 +0=8.\n\nSo 8 U, 0 D, 1 S in 9 actions (t=1 to9).\n\nThen y10=9.\n\nNow, with 9 actions, we have to have 8 U and 1 S.\n\nThe S must be placed such that we avoid collisions.\n\nThe dangerous points are at T=4 and T=5 for y=4,5,6.\n\nWe need to be not on those at those times.\n\nStart T=1, y=1, must take action, since we have actions.\n\nSuppose we take the S early or late.\n\nFor example, T=1, if a1=S, then y2=1\n\nT=2, y=1, but at T=2, y=1 safe, a2=U, y3=2\n\nT=3, y=2, safe, a3=U, y4=3\n\nT=4, y=3, safe, now a4=U, y5=4 but T=5 y=4? y5=4 at T=5, dangerous.\n\nCollision.\n\nIf at T=4, a4=S, then y5=3\n\nT=5, y=3, safe, then a5=U, y6=4\n\nT=6, y=4 safe, but we have only 8 U and 1 S, but we used one S at a4, and we need to go to y10=9 from y6=4.\n\ny6=4 at T=6, then we need y10=9, so increase by 5 in 4 actions (a6 to a9).\n\nWith 4 actions, we can do 4 U, so y10 = y6 +4 =4+4=8, but we need y10=9, impossible since only 4 actions to increase from y6.\n\ny6=4, a6 sets y7, a7 sets y8, a8 sets y9, a9 sets y10.\n\nWith a6 to a9, four actions, we can have up to 4 U, so y10 <=4+4=8<9, cannot reach 9.\n\nIf we place the S later.\n\nFor example, T=1, a1=U, y2=2\n\nT=2, a2=U, y3=3\n\nT=3, a3=S, y4=3\n\nT=4, y4=3, now a4 must be U or something, but if a4=U, y5=4, T=5 collision.\n\nIf a4=S, y5=3, T=5 y=3 safe, then a5=U, y6=4, T=6 y=4 safe.\n\nBut y6=4, then to y10=9, need +5 in 4 actions, impossible.\n\nT=1, a1=U, y2=2\n\nT=2, a2=S, y3=2  (S here)\n\nT=3, a3=U, y4=3\n\nT=4, a4=U, y5=4, but T=5 y=4? y5=4 at T=5 dangerous, collision.\n\nNot possible.\n\nT=1, a1=U, y2=2\n\nT=2, a2=U, y3=3\n\nT=3, a3=U, but y4=4 at T=4 collision, not possible.\n\nSo indeed, with H=10, we cannot avoid collision and reach y10=9.\n\nThus minimal H=11.\n\nNow for the sequence, as above.\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 2, no car, but we didn't use it, but it's fine.\n\nSo the actions:\n\nTurn 1: U\n\nTurn 2: S\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: S\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: S\n\nIn the answer format.\n\nBut let's write it properly.\n</think>\nTo reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 1) at turn \\(t_1 = 1\\) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the sequence of actions must navigate around dangerous time steps where collisions occur. The dangerous times for each freeway are derived from the car states at turn 1 and their movement rules.\n\n- **Collision conditions**:\n  - Freeway 1: collision at turns 3, 4, 5 and 12, 13, 14\n  - Freeway 2: no collision at any turn\n  - Freeway 3: collision at turns 12, 13, 14\n  - Freeway 4: collision at turns 3, 4, 5 and 12, 13, 14\n  - Freeway 5: collision at turns 3, 4, 5 and 12, 13, 14\n  - Freeway 6: collision at turns 3, 4, 5 and 12, 13, 14\n  - Freeway 7: collision at turns 12, 13, 14\n  - Freeway 8: collision at turns 12, 13, 14\n\nThe goal is to reach \\(y = 9\\) at turn \\(H\\) with minimal \\(H\\), avoiding being on a freeway \\(y\\) at turn \\(T\\) if \\((y, T)\\) is a dangerous pair. Starting at \\(y = 1\\) at turn 1, the player must move upward but avoid positions where collisions occur, particularly around turns 3–5 for freeways 4, 5, and 6.\n\nThe minimal \\(H\\) is 11, achieved with the following sequence of actions:\n- At turn 1, move up to \\(y = 2\\), avoiding collision at turn 1.\n- At turn 2, stay to remain at \\(y = 2\\) (safe, as freeway 2 has no collision risk).\n- At turn 3, move up to \\(y = 3\\), avoiding collision (freeway 3 is safe at turn 3).\n- At turn 4, stay to remain at \\(y = 3\\), avoiding the dangerous turn 4 for freeways 4, 5, and 6.\n- At turn 5, move up to \\(y = 4\\), now safe as the danger period for freeway 4 has passed.\n- From turns 6 to 10, move up consecutively to reach \\(y = 8\\) by turn 10, as all freeways are safe in this range (danger periods start at turn 12 or later).\n- At turn 11, stay at \\(y = 9\\) (the goal, no collision risk).\n\nThis sequence ensures no collisions:\n- Turn 1 (\\(y=1\\)): safe (not dangerous at turn 1)\n- Turn 2 (\\(y=2\\)): safe (freeway 2 always safe)\n- Turn 3 (\\(y=2\\)): safe\n- Turn 4 (\\(y=3\\)): safe (freeway 3 safe at turn 4)\n- Turn 5 (\\(y=3\\)): safe\n- Turn 6 (\\(y=4\\)): safe (danger period for freeway 4 ended at turn 5)\n- Turn 7 (\\(y=5\\)): safe (danger period for freeway 5 ended at turn 5)\n- Turn 8 (\\(y=6\\)): safe (danger period for freeway 6 ended at turn 5)\n- Turn 9 (\\(y=7\\)): safe (danger period starts at turn 12)\n- Turn 10 (\\(y=8\\)): safe (danger period starts at turn 12)\n- Turn 11 (\\(y=9\\)): safe (not a freeway)\n\nThe actions are listed below for turns 1 to 11, with \\(H = 11\\).\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 1: a_{1} = U \\\\\nTurn 2: a_{2} = S \\\\\nTurn 3: a_{3} = U \\\\\nTurn 4: a_{4} = S \\\\\nTurn 5: a_{5} = U \\\\\nTurn 6: a_{6} = U \\\\\nTurn 7: a_{7} = U \\\\\nTurn 8: a_{8} = U \\\\\nTurn 9: a_{9} = U \\\\\nTurn 10: a_{10} = U \\\\\nTurn 11: a_{11} = S\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at position (0, 2) at turn t₁ = 2. The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. Each turn, the player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing y by +1, -1, or 0 respectively, and y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars are on each freeway, and they move left or right with a certain speed. For right-moving cars, the span moves right over time, and for left-moving, it moves left. Collision happens if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T, and the x-position 0 is within the car's span at that turn.\n\nImportantly, when moving to a new freeway, you're not on that freeway until the next turn. So if you move from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T you're still on y, and you arrive at y+1 at turn T+1. So you only check for collision on the freeway you're currently on at the start of the turn.\n\nThe car states are given for turn t₁=2. I need to find a sequence of actions starting from turn 2 to reach y=9 as quickly as possible.\n\nFirst, list out the car positions at turn 2 for each freeway. Since all cars are right-moving, according to the data.\n\nFreeway 1: three cars\n\n- Car 1: head -40, tail -51, right, speed 4\n\nFor right-moving cars, head is the front, so since it's moving right, head should be greater than tail? Let me check the span definition.\n\nFor right-moving: Span(t₁) = [τ, h] and at T, [τ + s(T-t₁), h + s(T-t₁)]\n\nIn the table, for freeway 1, it says (-40, -51, right, 4). But -40 is head, -51 is tail? That seems odd because -40 > -51, so if head is -40 and tail is -51, and it's right-moving, but -40 > -51, so the span should be from tail to head, which is [-51, -40]? But in the notation, it says (head h, tail τ, direction, speed).\n\nLook: \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nFor freeway 1: (-40, -51, right, 4)\n\nh = -40, τ = -51\n\nSince direction is right, the span is [τ, h] = [-51, -40] at t₁=2.\n\nThen at time T, span is [τ + s(T-t₁), h + s(T-t₁)] = [-51 + 4(T-2), -40 + 4(T-2)]\n\nSimilarly, other cars.\n\nBut -51 + 4(T-2) and -40 + 4(T-2)\n\nSince s=4, and T increases, the car moves right.\n\nSimilarly, second car on freeway 1: (-4, -15, right, 4), so h=-4, τ=-15, so span [-15, -4] at t=2.\n\nτ=-15, h=-4, so [ -15, -4 ]\n\nAnd third car: (32, 21, right, 4), h=32, τ=21, so [21, 32]\n\nBut τ=21, h=32, yes [21,32]\n\nNow, for collision: at turn T, if player is on freeway k, and 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nAlso, player position: at turn T, y_T, and we need to avoid 0 in span for cars on y_T at T.\n\nNow, player starts at y=2 at t=2.\n\nGoal is y=9.\n\nSince we can only move one y per turn, the minimum number of turns to go from y=2 to y=9 is 7 turns if we move up every turn, but we might need to wait or avoid cars, so it could take more, but we want minimal, so probably we try to go up as much as possible, but avoid collisions.\n\nFirst, let's list all freeways and their cars at t=2, and then we need to see for each future turn, where the cars are.\n\nBut since cars move, we need to compute for each freeway, at each turn, if there is a car covering x=0.\n\nThat is, for each freeway k, and each turn T, if there exists a car on k such that 0 is in [τ + s(T-t₁), h + s(T-t₁)] for that car.\n\nSince all cars on a freeway might have different spans, we need to check each car.\n\nAlso, note that for right-moving cars, as above.\n\nIn this case, all cars are right-moving, from the data.\n\nFreeway 1: cars with (h,τ): (-40,-51), (-4,-15), (32,21) all right, speed 4.\n\nFreeway 2: only one car: (-48,-59, right,12)\n\nFreeway 3: one car: (-40,-51, right,4)\n\nFreeway 4: three cars: same as freeway 1: (-40,-51), (-4,-15), (32,21) all right speed 4\n\nFreeway 5: same three: (-40,-51), (-4,-15), (32,21) right speed 4\n\nFreeway 6: same three: (-40,-51), (-4,-15), (32,21) right speed 4\n\nFreeway 7: one car: (-40,-51, right,4)\n\nFreeway 8: one car: (-40,-51, right,4)\n\nNow, t₁=2.\n\nWe need to find for each freeway k from 1 to 8, for each turn T >=2, whether x=0 is occupied by a car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nThat is, for a given k and T, if min_span <= 0 <= max_span for some car on k at T.\n\nSince the spans are intervals, we can find when 0 is covered.\n\nLet Δt = T - t₁ = T - 2\n\nFor each car, the span at T is [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] for right-moving.\n\nThen 0 is in [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] if τ + s Δt <= 0 <= h + s Δt\n\nSince for right-moving, τ <= h, so the interval is [left, right] with left <= right.\n\nSo condition: τ + s Δt <= 0 and 0 <= h + s Δt\n\nWhich is equivalent to:\n\nFrom τ + s Δt <= 0: s Δt <= -τ  => Δt <= -τ / s\n\nFrom 0 <= h + s Δt: s Δt >= -h  => Δt >= -h / s\n\nAlso, since Δt >=0.\n\nSo for each car, the turns where it covers x=0 are from ceil( -h/s ) to floor( -τ/s ) in terms of Δt? Let's see.\n\nΔt >= ceil( -h/s ) ? Not exactly.\n\nLet's compute the range.\n\nFrom above:\n\nΔt >= -h / s  and  Δt <= -τ / s\n\nSince s >0.\n\nAnd since Δt must be integer, the integer Δt where it covers is from ceil( -h/s ) to floor( -τ/s )? Let's think carefully.\n\nFor example, take a car with h and τ.\n\nThe earliest Δt when it covers 0 is when h + s Δt >= 0, so Δt >= ceil( -h/s )? If -h/s is not integer, ceil(-h/s) is the smallest integer greater than or equal to -h/s.\n\nSimilarly, the latest Δt when τ + s Δt <= 0, so Δt <= floor( -τ/s )\n\nThen for Δt from max(0, ceil( -h/s ) ) to min( something, floor( -τ/s ) ), but only if ceil(-h/s) <= floor(-τ/s)\n\nLet's compute for each car.\n\nFirst, let's list all cars per freeway.\n\nFreeway 1:\n\nCar A: h=-40, τ=-51, s=4\n\nCompute -h/s = -(-40)/4 = 40/4 = 10\n\n-τ/s = -(-51)/4 = 51/4 = 12.75\n\nΔt >= -h/s = 10\n\nΔt <= -τ/s = 12.75\n\nSince Δt integer, Δt >= 10 and Δt <= 12.75, so Δt <= 12 since floor(12.75)=12\n\nSo Δt from 10 to 12 inclusive.\n\nThus at T = t₁ + Δt = 2 + Δt, so T=12,13,14? Δt=10,11,12 → T=12,13,14\n\nt₁=2, T=2 + Δt, Δt=10 → T=12, Δt=11→T=13, Δt=12→T=14\n\nNow, check: at Δt=10, h + s Δt = -40 + 4*10 = -40+40=0, τ + s Δt = -51 +40= -11, so [ -11, 0], 0 included.\n\nAt Δt=11, h+ s Δt= -40+44=4, τ+s Δt= -51+44= -7, [ -7,4], 0 in.\n\nAt Δt=12, h+ s Δt= -40+48=8, τ+s Δt= -51+48= -3, [ -3,8], 0 in.\n\nAt Δt=13, h+44= -40+52=12, τ+52= -51+52=1, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, Δt=9, h+36= -40+36= -4, τ+36= -51+36= -15, [-15,-4], 0 not in.\n\nSo yes, T=12,13,14.\n\nCar B on freeway 1: h=-4, τ=-15, s=4\n\n- h/s = -(-4)/4 = 4/4=1\n\n- τ/s = -(-15)/4 = 15/4 = 3.75\n\nΔt >= -h/s =1\n\nΔt <= -τ/s =3.75, so Δt <=3\n\nThen Δt >=1 and Δt <=3, so Δt=1,2,3\n\nT=2+1=3, T=4, T=5\n\nCheck: Δt=1, h+s Δt= -4+4=0, τ+s Δt= -15+4= -11, [ -11,0], 0 in.\n\nΔt=2, -4+8=4, -15+8= -7, [ -7,4], 0 in.\n\nΔt=3, -4+12=8, -15+12= -3, [ -3,8], 0 in.\n\nΔt=0, -4+0= -4, -15+0= -15, not cover 0.\n\nΔt=4, -4+16=12, -15+16=1, [1,12], 0 not.\n\nCar C on freeway 1: h=32, τ=21, s=4\n\n- h/s = -32/4 = -8\n\n- τ/s = -21/4 = -5.25\n\nΔt >= -h/s = -(-8) =8? -h/s = - (32)/4 = -32/4 = -8\n\n- h/s = - (32) / 4 = -8\n\nThen Δt >= -h/s = -8, but since Δt >=0, always true for Δt >=0? No.\n\nΔt >= ceil( -h/s )\n\n- h/s = -32/4 = -8, so ceil(-8) = -8, but Δt >=0, so Δt >=0 satisfies since -8 <=0.\n\nSimilarly, Δt <= floor( -τ/s ) = floor( -21/4 ) = floor(-5.25) = -6? Let's see.\n\n- τ/s = -21/4 = -5.25\n\nΔt <= -τ/s = -5.25\n\nBut Δt >=0, and -5.25 <0, so Δt <= -5.25 is impossible since Δt>=0. So no coverage.\n\nCheck: τ + s Δt =21 + 4 Δt, which for Δt=0 is 21, h+ s Δt=32, so [21,32] at T=2, all positive, not cover 0. As Δt increases, it moves right, so never covers 0 since left end 21 +4Δt >0 always. So yes, car C never covers 0.\n\nSo for freeway 1, cars that cover 0: car A at T=12,13,14 and car B at T=3,4,5.\n\nSo freeway 1 is occupied at T=3,4,5,12,13,14.\n\nNow freeway 2: one car (-48,-59, right,12)\n\nh=-48, τ=-59, s=12\n\n- h/s = -(-48)/12 = 48/12=4\n\n- τ/s = -(-59)/12 = 59/12 ≈ 4.9167\n\nΔt >= -h/s =4\n\nΔt <= -τ/s ≈4.9167, so Δt <=4 since floor(4.9167)=4? Δt <= floor(4.9167)=4\n\nBut Δt >=4 and Δt <=4, so Δt=4\n\nT=2+4=6\n\nCheck: at Δt=4, h+s Δt= -48 + 12*4 = -48+48=0, τ+s Δt= -59+48= -11, [ -11,0], 0 included.\n\nAt Δt=3, -48+36= -12, -59+36= -23, [ -23,-12], 0 not.\n\nΔt=5, -48+60=12, -59+60=1, [1,12], 0 not.\n\nSo freeway 2 occupied only at T=6.\n\nFreeway 3: one car (-40,-51, right,4) same as car A on freeway 1.\n\nSo h=-40, τ=-51, s=4\n\n- h/s = -(-40)/4=10\n\n- τ/s = -(-51)/4=12.75\n\nΔt >=10, Δt <=12.75, so Δt=10,11,12 → T=12,13,14\n\nOccupied at T=12,13,14\n\nFreeway 4: same as freeway 1, three cars: car A: (-40,-51, right,4) → covers T=12,13,14\n\nCar B: (-4,-15, right,4) → covers T=3,4,5\n\nCar C: (32,21, right,4) → never covers 0\n\nSo freeway 4 occupied at T=3,4,5 and T=12,13,14\n\nFreeway 5: same as freeway 1 and 4, occupied at T=3,4,5 and T=12,13,14\n\nFreeway 6: same, T=3,4,5 and T=12,13,14\n\nFreeway 7: one car (-40,-51, right,4) → same as car A, covers T=12,13,14\n\nFreeway 8: one car (-40,-51, right,4) → same, T=12,13,14\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway, the turns when it is occupied (i.e., some car covers x=0):\n\nFreeway 1: T=3,4,5 and 12,13,14\n\nFreeway 2: T=6\n\nFreeway 3: T=12,13,14\n\nFreeway 4: T=3,4,5 and 12,13,14\n\nFreeway 5: T=3,4,5 and 12,13,14\n\nFreeway 6: T=3,4,5 and 12,13,14\n\nFreeway 7: T=12,13,14\n\nFreeway 8: T=12,13,14\n\nNote that at other times, the freeway is clear.\n\nPlayer starts at y=2 at T=2.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\ny from 2 to 9, difference 7, so minimum 7 moves up.\n\nBut we need to avoid being on a freeway when it is occupied.\n\nThe player is on a freeway at turn T if y_T = k for k=1 to 8.\n\nAt T=2, player is on y=2.\n\ny=2 is freeway 2? Freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=2 is freeway 2.\n\nAt T=2, what is the state?\n\nWe need to check if at T=2, freeway 2 is occupied.\n\nFor freeway 2, we have occupied only at T=6, not at T=2.\n\nAt T=2, Δt=0.\n\nFor freeway 2 car: at Δt=0, h=-48, τ=-59, span [-59,-48], 0 not in, so freeway 2 clear at T=2.\n\nSimilarly, player is at y=2, which is freeway 2, and it's clear, so no collision at start.\n\nNow, we need to move to y=9.\n\nPossible actions: U, D, S each turn.\n\nSince we want minimal turns, we should go up as much as possible, but avoid occupied times.\n\nLet me list the occupied turns for each y:\n\ny=1 (freeway 1): occupied T=3,4,5,12,13,14\n\ny=2: occupied T=6\n\ny=3: occupied T=12,13,14\n\ny=4: occupied T=3,4,5,12,13,14\n\ny=5: occupied T=3,4,5,12,13,14\n\ny=6: occupied T=3,4,5,12,13,14\n\ny=7: occupied T=12,13,14\n\ny=8: occupied T=12,13,14\n\ny=9 is the goal, no cars.\n\nPlayer path: at each turn T, we are at y_T, and we choose action to set y_{T+1}.\n\nThe collision is checked at the beginning of the turn, based on y_T and the cars at T.\n\nAt turn T, we are on y_T, and we choose action, then move to y_{T+1} for the next turn.\n\nWe need to ensure that for each T, if y_T between 1 and 8, then freeway y_T is not occupied at T.\n\nStart at T=2, y=2, freeway 2 not occupied at T=2, ok.\n\nNow, we need to reach y=9 at some turn, say H, so at turn H, y_H=9.\n\nSince y=9 has no cars, it's always safe, but we need to be on it.\n\nThe minimal H: from y=2 to y=9, at least 7 turns if always up.\n\nBut we might need to wait or detour to avoid occupied times.\n\nFirst, let's see if we can go directly up without stopping.\n\nSuppose we go up every turn from T=2 to T=8: actions U,U,U,U,U,U,U\n\nThen y: T=2:2, action U → y3=3\n\nT=3: y=3, action U → y4=4\n\nT=4: y=4, action U → y5=5\n\nT=5: y=5, action U → y6=6\n\nT=6: y=6, action U → y7=7\n\nT=7: y=7, action U → y8=8\n\nT=8: y=8, action U → y9=9\n\nNow, at T=9, y=9, goal reached? H is the number of actions, from T=2 to T=8, we have actions at T=2,3,4,5,6,7,8, so 7 actions, reach at T=9.\n\nBut we need to check for collision at each turn T from 2 to 8, since y_T from 2 to 8.\n\nAt T=2: y=2, freeway 2 occupied only at T=6, not at T=2, so safe.\n\nT=3: y=3, freeway 3 occupied at T=12,13,14, not at T=3, so safe.\n\nT=4: y=4, freeway 4 occupied at T=3,4,5 and 12-14. At T=4, occupied, so collision!\n\nFreeway 4 occupied at T=4, and y=4 at T=4, so 0 in span, collision.\n\nSimilarly, T=5: y=5, freeway 5 occupied at T=5, collision.\n\nIn the sequence above, at T=4, y=4, occupied, so not safe.\n\nWe need to avoid being on y=4,5,6 at T=4 and T=5, since they are occupied.\n\ny=4,5,6 all occupied at T=3,4,5.\n\nSpecifically:\n\nAt T=3: freeways 1,4,5,6 occupied? Freeway 1 occupied at T=3,4,5; freeway 4 at T=3,4,5; freeway 5 at T=3,4,5; freeway 6 at T=3,4,5.\n\nBut at T=3, y=3: freeway 3 is not occupied at T=3, only at 12-14.\n\nIn the path above, at T=3, y=3, freeway 3 clear, safe.\n\nBut at T=4, y=4, freeway 4 occupied, unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, if we go up, we hit occupied at T=4.\n\nSo we need to not be on y=4,5,6 at T=4 and T=5? T=3,4,5 for those freeways.\n\nBut y=3 is safe at T=3, as above.\n\nProblem is y=4,5,6 at T=4 and T=5 specifically? Let's see the occupied times.\n\nFor y=4: occupied T=3,4,5\n\ny=5: T=3,4,5\n\ny=6: T=3,4,5\n\ny=3: occupied only at T=12,13,14, so at T=3, safe.\n\ny=2: occupied at T=6\n\ny=7: at T=12,13,14, safe earlier.\n\nIn the direct path, at T=3, y=3 safe, but at T=4, y=4 unsafe.\n\nTo avoid, we could stay or move down, but we want minimal turns.\n\nSince the occupation is at T=3,4,5 for y=4,5,6, we can be on other y or wait.\n\nBut y=1 is occupied at T=3,4,5 too, so not safe.\n\ny=2: at T=3, is it occupied? Freeway 2 occupied only at T=6, so at T=3, freeway 2 clear.\n\nSimilarly, y=7 clear at T=3.\n\ny=8 clear except later.\n\nSo at T=3, we could be on y=2 or y=3 or y=7, etc., but since we start from y=2 at T=2, we need to decide actions.\n\nPossible to stay at y=2 for some turns or move down to y=1 or up to y=3.\n\nBut y=1 occupied at T=3,4,5, so if we go to y=1, it might be unsafe.\n\nLet's plan the path.\n\nStart T=2, y=2.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nThe dangerous times are around T=3-5 and T=12-14.\n\nSince we start at T=2, and T=12-14 is far, we can reach before that if we go fast, but T=3-5 is soon.\n\nMinimal time to reach y=9 from y=2 is 7 turns, ending at T=9.\n\nBut at T=4 and T=5, if we are on y=4,5,6, it is occupied.\n\nIn a direct up path, at T=4, we are on y=4 if we went up from T=3 y=3.\n\nAt T=2, y=2, after action.\n\nLet's think turn by turn.\n\nAt turn T, we are at y_t, choose action to set y_{t+1}.\n\nFor collision at T, it depends on y_T.\n\nWe need for each T, y_T not in occupied freeway at T.\n\nAt T=2: y=2, freeway 2 not occupied, safe.\n\nNow for T=3: we will be at y_3, which depends on action at T=2.\n\nAction at T=2: if U, then y3=3; if S, y3=2; if D, y3=1.\n\ny=3 at T=3: freeway 3 not occupied at T=3, safe.\n\ny=2 at T=3: freeway 2 not occupied at T=3 (only at T=6), safe.\n\ny=1 at T=3: freeway 1 occupied at T=3, unsafe! So cannot be at y=1 at T=3.\n\nSimilarly, at T=4, if y=4, occupied; y=5 occupied; y=6 occupied; y=3 not occupied; y=2 not occupied; y=1 occupied; etc.\n\nLet's list for each T, which y are safe.\n\nT=2: y=2 is safe (as above)\n\nAlso, at T=2, player is at y=2, so we start from there.\n\nFor T=3:\n\n- If y=1: occupied, unsafe\n\n- y=2: freeway 2 clear, safe\n\n- y=3: freeway 3 clear, safe\n\n- y=4: occupied (since freeway 4 occ at T=3), unsafe\n\n- y=5: occupied, unsafe\n\n- y=6: occupied, unsafe\n\n- y=7: clear, safe\n\n- y=8: clear, safe\n\n- y=9: safe, but not reached yet\n\nSimilarly for other T.\n\nT=4:\n\n- y=1: occupied (T=4), unsafe\n\n- y=2: clear (freeway 2 occ only T=6), safe\n\n- y=3: clear (occ only later), safe\n\n- y=4: occupied, unsafe\n\n- y=5: occupied, unsafe\n\n- y=6: occupied, unsafe\n\n- y=7: clear, safe\n\n- y=8: clear, safe\n\nT=5:\n\n- y=1: occupied, unsafe\n\n- y=2: clear, safe\n\n- y=3: clear, safe\n\n- y=4: occupied, unsafe\n\n- y=5: occupied, unsafe\n\n- y=6: occupied, unsafe\n\n- y=7: clear, safe\n\n- y=8: clear, safe\n\nT=6:\n\n- y=1: not occupied at T=6? Freeway 1 occ at T=3,4,5 and 12,13,14, not T=6, so clear? T=6 not in {3,4,5,12,13,14}, so clear.\n\nSimilarly, y=2: freeway 2 occupied at T=6, so unsafe.\n\ny=3: freeway 3 occ only T=12-14, not T=6, clear, safe\n\ny=4: occ at T=3,4,5,12-14, not T=6, clear, safe\n\nSimilarly y=5,6,7,8 all clear at T=6 except y=2 occupied.\n\nFreeway 2 occupied at T=6.\n\nOthers not.\n\nSo at T=6:\n\n- y=1: clear, safe\n\n- y=2: occupied, unsafe\n\n- y=3: clear, safe\n\n- y=4: clear, safe\n\n- y=5: clear, safe\n\n- y=6: clear, safe\n\n- y=7: clear, safe\n\n- y=8: clear, safe\n\nT=7:\n\nAll freeways clear except later occupations, so all y=1-8 safe at T=7.\n\nSimilarly T=8,9, etc., until T=12.\n\nNow back to path.\n\nWe start T=2, y=2, safe.\n\nNow for T=3, we need y_3 safe.\n\nPossible y_3: from action at T=2.\n\nIf action S, y3=2, safe.\n\nIf action U, y3=3, safe.\n\nIf action D, y3=1, but y=1 at T=3 unsafe, so cannot do D.\n\nSo at T=2, actions S or U are possible, D not.\n\nSuppose we do U at T=2, so y3=3.\n\nThen at T=3, y=3, safe.\n\nNow for T=4, we need y_4 safe.\n\ny_4 depends on action at T=3.\n\nAt T=3, we are at y=3.\n\nAction: if U, y4=4; but y=4 at T=4 occupied, unsafe.\n\nIf S, y4=3; y=3 at T=4 safe? At T=4, y=3 is safe, as above.\n\nIf D, y4=2; y=2 at T=4 safe.\n\nSo at T=3, we can do S or D, not U.\n\nSuppose we do S at T=3, so y4=3.\n\nThen at T=4, y=3, safe.\n\nNow for T=5, need y_5 safe.\n\nAt T=4, y=3, action: if U, y5=4; but y=4 at T=5 occupied, unsafe.\n\nIf S, y5=3; y=3 at T=5 safe.\n\nIf D, y5=2; y=2 at T=5 safe.\n\nSo again, cannot do U, can do S or D.\n\nSuppose we do S again, y5=3.\n\nThen at T=5, y=3, safe.\n\nNow T=6, need y_6 safe.\n\nAt T=5, y=3, action.\n\nPossible: if U, y6=4; y=4 at T=6: freeway 4 not occupied at T=6 (occ only T=3-5,12-14), so clear, safe.\n\nIf S, y6=3; y=3 at T=6 safe.\n\nIf D, y6=2; but y=2 at T=6 occupied, unsafe! Cannot.\n\nSo at T=5, we can do U or S, not D.\n\nIf we do U, y6=4.\n\nThen at T=6, y=4, safe as above.\n\nThen we can continue up.\n\nFrom T=6, y=4.\n\nAction at T=6: U to y7=5, or S to y7=4, or D to y7=3.\n\nAt T=7, all safe, so we can go up.\n\nSimilarly to y=9.\n\nBut we are at y=4 at T=6, need to go to y=9.\n\ny=4 to y=9, need 5 moves up.\n\nBut let's see the turns.\n\nIn this path: T=2: y=2, action U → y3=3\n\nT=3: y=3, action S → y4=3\n\nT=4: y=3, action S → y5=3\n\nT=5: y=3, action U → y6=4\n\nT=6: y=4, action U → y7=5\n\nT=7: y=5, action U → y8=6\n\nT=8: y=6, action U → y9=7? y9=7? Let's list positions.\n\nAt T=6, y=4\n\nAfter action at T=6, y7=5 if U\n\nT=7: y=5, action U → y8=6\n\nT=8: y=6, action U → y9=7\n\nT=9: y=7, action U → y10=8\n\nT=10: y=8, action U → y11=9\n\nReached at T=11, y=11=9? y11=9.\n\nBut at T=11, y=9, goal.\n\nNumber of actions: from T=2 to T=10, actions at T=2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10? That's 9 actions.\n\nBut we started from y=2 at T=2, after 8 actions we reach y=10=9? Let's count.\n\nInitial: T=2, y=2\n\nAfter action T=2: y3=3 (U)\n\nT=3: y=3, action S, y4=3\n\nT=4: y=3, action S, y5=3\n\nT=5: y=3, action U, y6=4\n\nT=6: y=4, action U, y7=5\n\nT=7: y=5, action U, y8=6\n\nT=8: y=6, action U, y9=7\n\nT=9: y=7, action U, y10=8\n\nT=10: y=8, action U, y11=9\n\nSo at T=11, y=9. Actions from T=2 to T=10, 9 actions.\n\nBut we can do better? Earlier we had two S actions, which delayed us.\n\nAt T=5, we could have done U to go to y=4 at T=6.\n\nBut at T=4, instead of staying, we could move.\n\nAnother idea: at T=3, instead of staying, we could go down to y=2.\n\nAt T=2, action U to y3=3.\n\nThen at T=3, action D to y4=2.\n\ny4=2 at T=4: safe, as y=2 at T=4 safe.\n\nThen at T=4, y=2, we can do action.\n\nPossible U to y5=3, or S to y5=2, or D to y5=1.\n\ny=1 at T=5: occupied? T=5, y=1 occupied, unsafe.\n\ny=2 at T=5: safe.\n\ny=3 at T=5: safe.\n\nSo at T=4, y=2, action: U to y5=3, or S to y5=2, not D.\n\nSuppose U to y5=3.\n\nThen at T=5, y=3, safe.\n\nThen at T=5, action: as before, U to y6=4 or S to y6=3.\n\nIf U to y6=4, then at T=6, y=4, safe.\n\nThen continue up.\n\nPath: T=2: action U, y3=3\n\nT=3: action D, y4=2\n\nT=4: action U, y5=3\n\nT=5: action U, y6=4\n\nT=6: action U, y7=5\n\nT=7: y=5, action U, y8=6\n\nT=8: y=6, action U, y9=7\n\nT=9: y=7, action U, y10=8\n\nT=10: y=8, action U, y11=9\n\nSame as before, 9 actions to reach at T=11.\n\nAfter T=5, y=3, we could go directly.\n\nBut we need to go to higher y.\n\nAt T=3, if we stay, we are at y=3 until T=5, then go to y=4 at T=6.\n\nBut y=3 to y=9 is 6 steps, from T=6 y=4 to y=9, 5 steps, but we start moving at T=6.\n\nFrom T=6 y=4 to T=11 y=9, 5 actions.\n\nTotal from T=2 to T=10 actions, 9 actions.\n\nBut minimal should be 7, but we have delays.\n\nCan we avoid the occupied zone by going faster or slower?\n\nAt T=2, instead of going up, we stay or go down, but going down might be worse.\n\nAt T=2, action S: stay at y=2.\n\nThen y3=2 at T=3, safe.\n\nThen at T=3, y=2, action: U to y4=3, or S to y4=2, or D to y4=1.\n\nD to y4=1: at T=4, y=1, occupied? T=4, y=1 occupied, unsafe, so cannot.\n\nS to y4=2, safe.\n\nU to y4=3, safe.\n\nIf at T=3, action U to y4=3.\n\nThen at T=4, y=3, safe.\n\nThen at T=4, action: U to y5=4, but y=4 at T=5? Action at T=4 sets y5.\n\nAt T=4, we are at y=3, choose action for y5.\n\nIf U, y5=4; but at T=5, y=4 occupied, unsafe.\n\nIf S, y5=3, safe.\n\nIf D, y5=2, safe.\n\nSo cannot U, must S or D.\n\nThen similar to before.\n\nIf we go to y=2 earlier.\n\nAnother point: at T=6, y=2 is occupied, so we cannot be on y=2 at T=6.\n\nBut in previous paths, we avoided that.\n\nPerhaps we can go up to y=7 or 8 before T=12, but T=12 is later.\n\nFor example, if we can reach y=9 by T=8 or 9, before T=12.\n\nBut with occupations at T=3-5, we need to not be on y=4,5,6 at those times.\n\nSince we start at y=2 at T=2, we can go to y=3 at T=3, then we need to stay or move to avoid y=4,5,6 at T=4 and T=5.\n\nAt T=4, we can be on y=2,3,7,8\n\nSimilarly at T=5.\n\nBut to be on y=7 or 8, we need to be higher earlier.\n\nAt T=2, y=2, we can only reach y=3 at T=3, then at T=4, if we go U, we go to y=4, which is bad, but we can't go directly to y=7.\n\nSo we have to be on y=2 or y=3 at T=4 and T=5, since moving up takes time.\n\nThen at T=6, we can start moving up.\n\nBut at T=6, we can be on y=3,4,5,6,7,8 all safe except y=2.\n\nIn the path, at T=5, if we are at y=3, we can go to y=4 at T=6.\n\nThen from y=4 at T=6, we need to go to y=9.\n\ny=4 to y=9 is 5 steps: to y5=5 at T=7, y6=6 at T=8, y7=7 at T=9, y8=8 at T=10, y9=9 at T=11.\n\nSo reach at T=11.\n\nCan we be at a higher y at T=6?\n\nFor example, if at T=5, we were at y=7, then we can go faster.\n\nBut can we reach y=7 by T=5?\n\nFrom y=2 at T=2 to y=7 at T=5.\n\nT=2: y=2, action U to y3=3\n\nT=3: y=3, action U to y4=4, but at T=4, y=4 occupied, collision! Cannot.\n\nIf we go down or stay, we are lower.\n\nSo impossible to be at y=7 by T=5; the highest we can be at T=4 is y=3 or 4, but y=4 unsafe at T=4.\n\nAt T=4, we can be at y=3 max if we started from y=2.\n\nAt T=2: y=2\n\nAfter T=2 action: U to y3=3\n\nThen at T=3, if we could go up, but U to y4=4 unsafe, so we stay or down, so y4<=3.\n\nSimilarly, at T=4, y<=3, then at T=5, y<=4 if we go up, but at T=5 y=4 unsafe, so at T=5 y<=3.\n\nThen at T=6, we can go to y=4.\n\nSo we are stuck at y<=3 until T=5, then at T=6 y=4, then to y=9 in 5 more turns, reach T=11.\n\nBut earlier at T=3, we could go down to y=2, but that doesn't help to go higher.\n\nAt T=2, if we stay, y3=2, then at T=3, go U to y4=3, same as before.\n\nOr at T=3, go S, y4=2, then at T=4, go U to y5=3, then at T=5, go U to y6=4, same as before.\n\nSo seems inevitable to be delayed until T=6.\n\nBut at T=6, we are at y=4, then to y=9.\n\nBut y=4 to y=9 is 5 moves, 5 turns actions, from T=6 to T=10 actions, reach y at T=11.\n\nActions at T=6,7,8,9,10 for moving up, plus previous actions.\n\nIn the sequence, from T=2 to T=5, we have actions: for example, T=2:U, T=3:S, T=4:S, T=5:U, that's 4 actions to reach y=4 at T=6.\n\nThen T=6:U, T=7:U, T=8:U, T=9:U, T=10:U to reach y=9 at T=11, 5 actions.\n\nTotal 9 actions.\n\nBut we can reach faster if we go to a safe y earlier.\n\nWhat about y=7 or 8.\n\nFor example, at T=4, we can be on y=7 if we moved up fast, but from y=2 at T=2, to y=7 at T=4: need two U, but at T=3, if we go U to y=3, then at T=3 go U to y=4, but at T=4 y=4 occupied, unsafe.\n\nCannot.\n\nSimilarly, no way.\n\nSo indeed, the earliest we can be above y=3 is at T=6, at y=4.\n\nThen 5 more to y=9.\n\nBut at T=6, we can be at y=4, but we can be higher if we moved during the waiting.\n\nBut during T=3 to T=5, we are at y=2 or 3, which are safe, but we can't move up because we would hit occupied.\n\nFor example, at T=4, if we are at y=3, we can go to y=2, but that doesn't help.\n\nOr stay.\n\nBut no up.\n\nSo y=4 at T=6 is the best.\n\nThen from there.\n\nBut let's confirm the actions.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn t1=2: action U, so y3=3\n\nThen at T=3, we need to not go up, so action S or D.\n\nIf S, y4=3\n\nAt T=4, action S, y5=3\n\nAt T=5, action U, y6=4\n\nAt T=6, action U, y7=5\n\nAt T=7, action U, y8=6\n\nAt T=8, action U, y9=7\n\nAt T=9, action U, y10=8\n\nAt T=10, action U, y11=9\n\nReached at T=11.\n\nBut at T=8, y=6, is it safe? At T=8, freeway 6 occupied only at T=3,4,5 and 12,13,14, not at T=8, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, T=9 y=7, freeway 7 occupied only T=12-14, safe.\n\nT=10 y=8, safe.\n\nT=11 y=9, goal.\n\nNow, number of turns H: from turn 2 to turn 10, 9 actions, H=9.\n\nBut we might reduce by moving during the waiting period, but we can't.\n\nAt T=3, if we do D to y4=2, then at T=4, y=2, action U to y5=3, then at T=5, y=3, action U to y6=4, same as above, but we did D and U instead of S S, same number of actions.\n\nIn fact, with D and U, we have extra move, but same y at same time.\n\nIn this case, at T=4, we are at y=2 instead of y=3, which is lower, but we go to y=3 at T=5, then to y=4 at T=6, same as before.\n\nBut in terms of actions, it's the same.\n\nFor example: T=2: U, y3=3\n\nT=3: D, y4=2\n\nT=4: U, y5=3\n\nT=5: U, y6=4\n\nThen same as before.\n\nBut now we have an extra D and U, which might not be efficient, but in this case, we reach y=4 at T=6 same as staying at y=3 for two turns.\n\nBut with more actions? No, actions: T=2:U, T=3:D, T=4:U, T=5:U, that's 4 actions to y=4 at T=6.\n\nSame as T=2:U, T=3:S, T=4:S, T=5:U, also 4 actions.\n\nThen continue.\n\nSo no gain.\n\nBut we can reach earlier if we can be at y=9 before.\n\nAnother idea: go to y=0 or y=9, but y=0 is bottom, not helpful.\n\ny=9 is goal.\n\nPerhaps during T=6 to T=11, but we have occupations at T=12-14, but since we reach by T=11, before, it should be fine.\n\nBut in the path above, we reach at T=11.\n\nIs there a way to save one turn?\n\nFor example, at T=5, if we can be at y=4, but at T=5, y=4 is occupied, so we cannot be there.\n\nAt T=6, we can be at y=4.\n\nBut from y=4 at T=6, to y=9 at T=11, 5 turns.\n\nPerhaps we can be at y=5 at T=6 or something.\n\nHow? At T=6, y=5: to be at y=5 at T=6, we need to have y5=5? At T=5, we are at y, action U to y6=5.\n\nBut at T=5, if we are at y=4, but y=4 at T=5 occupied, cannot.\n\nIf at T=5 we are at y=3, action U to y6=4, not 5.\n\nTo be at y=5 at T=6, we need to be at y=4 at T=5 and action U, but at T=5 y=4 occupied, impossible.\n\nSimilarly, cannot be higher than y=4 at T=6.\n\nSo y=4 at T=6 is best.\n\nThen to y=9 in 5 steps.\n\nThus minimal H=9 actions.\n\nBut let's confirm the sequence.\n\nWe also have to avoid T=12-14, but since we finish by T=11, it's fine.\n\nNow, the sequence of actions.\n\nStarting from turn t1=2.\n\nWe need to output actions for turn t1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nH=9, so t from 0 to 8.\n\nt=0: turn 2, action a2\n\nt=1: turn 3, a3\n\n...\n\nt=8: turn 10, a10\n\nAnd y at turn 11 should be 9.\n\nIn the sequence above:\n\nTurn 2: action U (to y=3)\n\nTurn 3: action S (stay y=3) or we can do D, but S is fine.\n\nTo be consistent, let's use S.\n\nTurn 4: action S (stay y=3)\n\nTurn 5: action U (to y=4)\n\nTurn 6: action U (to y=5)\n\nTurn 7: action U (to y=6)\n\nTurn 8: action U (to y=7)\n\nTurn 9: action U (to y=8)\n\nTurn 10: action U (to y=9)\n\nIn this, at turn 10, action U, y11=9.\n\nBut turn 10 is t1 + 8? t1=2, H=9, actions from t=2 to t=10, that's turns 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10.\n\nAfter action at turn 10, y at turn 11 is 9.\n\nThe sequence: a2=U, a3=S, a4=S, a5=U, a6=U, a7=U, a8=U, a9=U, a10=U\n\nBut at turn 9, action U to y10=8? Let's list:\n\nAfter action at turn t, y_{t+1} is set.\n\nTurn t: action a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + delta\n\nAt turn 2: y2=2, a2=U, then y3=3\n\nTurn 3: y3=3, a3=S, y4=3\n\nTurn 4: y4=3, a4=S, y5=3\n\nTurn 5: y5=3, a5=U, y6=4\n\nTurn 6: y6=4, a6=U, y7=5\n\nTurn 7: y7=5, a7=U, y8=6\n\nTurn 8: y8=6, a8=U, y9=7\n\nTurn 9: y9=7, a9=U, y10=8\n\nTurn 10: y10=8, a10=U, y11=9\n\nYes.\n\nWe can have a different action at turn 3 or 4, but same.\n\nIn the answer, we need to output from turn t1.\n\nNow, about the car at T=6 for y=2, but we avoided it.\n\nIs there a shorter path?\n\nSuppose at turn 2, we do not U, but S.\n\nThen y3=2\n\nThen at turn 3, y3=2, action U to y4=3\n\nThen turn 4, y4=3, action: cannot U to y5=4 unsafe, so S or D.\n\nIf S, y5=3\n\nThen turn 5, y5=3, action U to y6=4\n\nSame as before, but we started with S instead of U at turn 2, so we are one step behind: at turn 2 action S, we are still y=2 at turn 3, whereas with U, we were y=3 at turn 3.\n\nSo worse.\n\nIf at turn 4, we do D to y5=2, then at turn 5, y5=2, but at T=5 y=2 safe, action U to y6=3, then at turn 6, y6=3, action U to y7=4, now at T=7 y=4, which is later than before.\n\nThen from y=4 at T=7, to y=9 at T=12, even later.\n\nSo worse.\n\nThus the first path is better.\n\nPerhaps we can go directly to y=7 or something, but not possible.\n\nSo minimal H=9.\n\nBut let's check if we can reach by T=10 or something.\n\nFor example, if at T=5, we are at y=3, then at T=5 action U to y6=4, T=6 y=4, U to y7=5, T=7 y=5, U to y8=6, T=8 y=6, U to y9=7, T=9 y=7, U to y10=8, T=10 y=8, U to y11=9, same T=11.\n\nIf we could be at y=5 at T=6, but impossible.\n\nAnother idea: use down to y=1 or something, but y=1 occupied at T=3,4,5, so dangerous.\n\nFor example, at turn 2, action D to y3=1, but at T=3, y=1 occupied, collision! Cannot.\n\nSo no.\n\nThus, the sequence above is minimal.\n\nNow, for the answer, we need to output the actions.\n\nIn the sequence, we have two S actions at turn 3 and 4.\n\nWe could have different, but it's fine.\n\nSince at turn 3, we could do D to y4=2, then turn 4 U to y5=3, turn 5 U to y6=4, same.\n\nBut with D and U, it might be unnecessary, but same number.\n\nI think S S is fine.\n\nNow, about the later occupations at T=12-14, but we reach before, so no issue.\n\nIn the path, we go through y=6 at T=8, which is freeway 6, and at T=8, it is not occupied, as per earlier.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nSo should be safe.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=9.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: S\n\nTurn 4: S\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nIn the answer format, it should be for each turn.\n\nNow, the player reaches (0,9) at turn 11, after action at turn 10.\n\nThe sequence is for t from t1 to t1+H-1, which is turn 2 to turn 10.\n\nIn the box.\n\nAlso, in the car state, freeway 2 has a car at T=6, but we are not on it at that time.\n\nIn this path, at T=6, we are at y=4, not y=2.\n\nAll good.\n\nPerhaps we can save a turn by going to y=9 faster, but not possible.\n\nAnother thought: at turn 5, after staying at y=3, we go U to y=4 at T=6.\n\nBut at T=6, if we could go multiple steps, but no, one move per turn.\n\nSo I think 9 is minimal.\n\nThus the sequence.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 2) at turn \\(t_1 = 2\\) and must reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis:\n- The minimum vertical distance from \\(y = 2\\) to \\(y = 9\\) is 7 units, requiring at least 7 \"U\" actions if no delays.\n- However, cars occupy certain freeways at specific turns, forcing the player to wait or adjust the path:\n  - Freeways \\(y = 1, 4, 5, 6\\) are occupied at turns \\(T = 3, 4, 5\\) and \\(T = 12, 13, 14\\).\n  - Freeway \\(y = 2\\) is occupied at \\(T = 6\\).\n  - Freeways \\(y = 3, 7, 8\\) are occupied at \\(T = 12, 13, 14\\).\n- Since the goal must be reached before \\(T = 12\\) to avoid later occupations, and occupations at \\(T = 3, 4, 5\\) block direct upward movement, the player must stay at \\(y = 3\\) during \\(T = 4\\) and \\(T = 5\\) to avoid collisions.\n- The earliest safe upward movement to \\(y = 4\\) is at \\(T = 6\\), after which the player can move up continuously to \\(y = 9\\).\n\n### Optimal Path:\n- At \\(T = 2\\), the player is at \\(y = 2\\) (freeway 2, unoccupied at \\(T = 2\\)).\n- Move up to \\(y = 3\\) at \\(T = 3\\) (freeway 3, unoccupied at \\(T = 3\\)).\n- Stay at \\(y = 3\\) for \\(T = 4\\) and \\(T = 5\\) to avoid occupations on \\(y = 4, 5, 6\\).\n- At \\(T = 6\\), move up to \\(y = 4\\) (freeway 4, unoccupied at \\(T = 6\\)).\n- Then move up each turn to reach \\(y = 9\\) by \\(T = 11\\).\n\nThis path requires 9 actions (turns \\(T = 2\\) to \\(T = 10\\)), with the player reaching (0, 9) at \\(T = 11\\).\n\n### Action Sequence:\n- **Turn 2**: U (move to \\(y = 3\\) at \\(T = 3\\))\n- **Turn 3**: S (stay at \\(y = 3\\) for \\(T = 4\\))\n- **Turn 4**: S (stay at \\(y = 3\\) for \\(T = 5\\))\n- **Turn 5**: U (move to \\(y = 4\\) at \\(T = 6\\))\n- **Turn 6**: U (move to \\(y = 5\\) at \\(T = 7\\))\n- **Turn 7**: U (move to \\(y = 6\\) at \\(T = 8\\))\n- **Turn 8**: U (move to \\(y = 7\\) at \\(T = 9\\))\n- **Turn 9**: U (move to \\(y = 8\\) at \\(T = 10\\))\n- **Turn 10**: U (move to \\(y = 9\\) at \\(T = 11\\))\n\n### Verification:\n- Collisions are avoided:\n  - \\(T = 2\\): \\(y = 2\\), freeway 2 unoccupied.\n  - \\(T = 3\\): \\(y = 3\\), freeway 3 unoccupied.\n  - \\(T = 4\\): \\(y = 3\\), freeway 3 unoccupied.\n  - \\(T = 5\\): \\(y = 3\\), freeway 3 unoccupied.\n  - \\(T = 6\\): \\(y = 4\\), freeway 4 unoccupied.\n  - \\(T = 7\\): \\(y = 5\\), freeway 5 unoccupied.\n  - \\(T = 8\\): \\(y = 6\\), freeway 6 unoccupied.\n  - \\(T = 9\\): \\(y = 7\\), freeway 7 unoccupied.\n  - \\(T = 10\\): \\(y = 8\\), freeway 8 unoccupied.\n- The player reaches \\(y = 9\\) at \\(T = 11\\), before the \\(T = 12-14\\) occupations.\n\nThis sequence achieves the goal in \\(H = 9\\) turns, the minimum possible given the constraints.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 2: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 3: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 4: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 5: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: U \\\\ \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 3, and the player is at (0,3). The goal is to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nImportant: The collision rule says that at turn T, if the player is at (0, y_T), then we check the freeway y_T at that turn T. The player is only on the freeway of the row they are currently on at that exact turn.\n\nNote: The cars are moving on fixed freeways (rows) and we only care about the freeway we are on at the turn we are on that row.\n\nThe car update: \n  - Right-moving: the car's head (h) and tail (τ) are given. The car moves to the right at speed s. So at time T, the car's position is [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)] for a right-moving car? \nBut note: the table says for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\"\nSo the head is the larger coordinate? Actually, the table says for right-moving: at t1, the span is [τ, h] meaning from τ to h, and since it's moving right, both increase.\n\nBut in the given data, for example, freeway 1: \n  (-36, -47, right, 4) -> at t1=3, the car is from -47 to -36? But note: the representation is (head, tail, direction, speed). \n  However, the table says for right-moving: at t1, the span is [τ, h]. So in the data, the first two numbers are head and tail? But the example: (head=-36, tail=-47) for a right-moving car? Then the span at t1 is [tail, head] = [-47, -36]. Then as time passes, the car moves right: \n      Span(T) = [-47 + s*(T-t1), -36 + s*(T-t1)]\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving cars, it would be [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)], but we don't have any left-moving in this problem.\n\nSo all cars in this state are right-moving.\n\nWe are at turn T (starting at T0 = t1 = 3) and we need to plan a sequence of actions (U, D, S) to move from y=3 to y=9, avoiding collisions.\n\nThe player update: \n  - At each turn, we choose an action: \n        U: y = y + 1 (if y<9)\n        D: y = y - 1 (if y>0)\n        S: y remains\n\nWe start at y3 = 3 at turn 3.\n\nWe need to compute for each freeway and for each future turn (relative to t1=3) the positions of the cars on that freeway.\n\nSince we are only concerned with whether the player is on a freeway at a particular turn and whether at that turn the car spans cover 0, we can compute the car positions at any future turn T (where T>=3).\n\nWe note that a car on freeway k at turn T will cause a collision if the player is on row k at turn T and 0 is in the car's span at turn T.\n\nThe car's span at turn T (for a right-moving car) is [τ + s*(T-3), h + s*(T-3)], where (h, τ) are the head and tail at turn 3? But wait, the data gives (head, tail) at turn 3? Actually, the table says \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\" at turn t1=3.\n\nSo for a car (h, τ, right, s) at turn 3, at turn T (>=3) the span is:\n  [τ + s*(T-3), h + s*(T-3)]\n\nWe require that at the turn when the player is on freeway k, the point x=0 is not in the span of any car on that freeway at that same turn.\n\nWe are to find the minimal H (number of turns) and the actions from turn 3 to turn 3+H-1 such that at turn 3+H-1, y=9.\n\nWe note that the player can only change by at most 1 per turn, so the minimum H without obstacles would be 6 (from 3 to 9: 3->4->5->6->7->8->9, 6 moves? Actually, from 3 to 9: 9-3=6 steps, so 6 actions? But note: we start at turn 3 and do H actions, then at the end of H actions we are at turn 3+H. But the position after H actions is y_{3+H}. We want y_{3+H} = 9.\n\nActually, the sequence: \n  turn 3: we start at y3 = 3.\n  turn 4: we are at y4 = y3 + Δy3 (from action at turn3)\n  ...\n  turn 3+H: we are at y_{3+H} = ... \n\nBut note: the problem says: we are to reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1? Let me read:\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nSo the sequence is for t from 0 to H-1: meaning actions at turns: t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\nThen after H actions, the turn is t1+H, and the position is y_{t1+H}.\n\nBut we want to be at (0,9) at that turn? Actually, the problem says: \"reach (0,9)\" at the end. So y_{t1+H} = 9.\n\nBut note: the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning:\n  a_{t1+0} = action at turn t1\n  a_{t1+1} = action at turn t1+1\n  ...\n  a_{t1+H-1} = action at turn t1+H-1\n\nThen the last action is at turn t1+H-1, and the position after that action is at turn t1+H.\n\nBut the problem says: \"reach (0,9)\" at turn t1+H-1? Actually, the problem says: \"such that y_{t1+H-1} = 9\". \n\nWait, let me read again: \n  \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}_{t=0}^{H-1} which minimizes H such that y_{t1+H-1} = 9\"\n\nSo the position at turn t1+H-1 is 9.\n\nThat means we do H actions: \n  action at turn t1 (t=0) -> leads to position at turn t1+1\n  action at turn t1+1 (t=1) -> leads to position at turn t1+2\n  ...\n  action at turn t1+H-1 (t=H-1) -> leads to position at turn t1+H.\n\nBut we require y_{t1+H-1} = 9? That would be the position at the turn before the last action? That doesn't make sense.\n\nLet me read the problem again: \n  \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nand then: \"such that y_{t1+H-1} = 9\"\n\nBut note the player update: \n  y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\n\nSo after one action at turn t, we get y_{t+1}.\n\nTherefore, if we do an action at turn t1, then we get y_{t1+1}.\nThen after H actions (at turns t1, t1+1, ... t1+H-1), we have updated the position H times, so the final position is y_{t1+H}.\n\nBut the problem says: we want y_{t1+H-1} = 9? That would be after H-1 actions? \n\nWait, the index: \n  t0 = t1: we are at y_{t1} = 3.\n  After first action (at t1): we get y_{t1+1}.\n  After second action (at t1+1): we get y_{t1+2}.\n  ...\n  After H actions (the last at t1+H-1): we get y_{t1+H}.\n\nBut the problem says: we want to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1? That would be the position after H-1 actions? \n\nBut note the problem states: \"reach (0,9)\" at the end of the sequence, and the sequence has H actions. \n\nLooking at the example answer format: \n  Turn t1: a_{t1}\n  Turn t1+1: a_{t1+1}\n  ...\n  Turn t1+H-1: a_{t1+H-1}\n\nAnd then we have done H actions, and the position after the last action is at turn t1+H. But the problem says we require y_{t1+H-1} = 9? \n\nThis seems inconsistent.\n\nLet me check the problem: \n  \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nand then: \"such that y_{t1+H-1} = 9\"\n\nBut note: the position at the beginning of turn t1 is (0,3). Then we take an action at turn t1, and then at turn t1+1 we have a new position. So the position at the end of the sequence of actions is at turn t1+H (after H actions). \n\nHowever, the problem says we require the position at turn t1+H-1 to be 9? That would be the position at the beginning of turn t1+H-1? But we are taking an action at turn t1+H-1 to move from y_{t1+H-1} to y_{t1+H}. \n\nThis is confusing.\n\nLooking back at the problem: \n  \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning we are controlling the actions at turns from t1 to t1+H-1. \n\nAnd then it says: \"to reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\"? \n\nBut the player update rule: \n  y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\n\nSo at turn t1, we take action a_{t1} and then at turn t1+1, we are at y_{t1+1}. \n\nTherefore, the position at turn t1+1 is the result of the first action. \n\nSo to have the position at turn t1+H-1 be 9, we are saying that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at 9? But then we don't need to take an action at turn t1+H-1? \n\nBut the sequence of actions includes an action at turn t1+H-1? \n\nThis is a discrepancy.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem means that we take H actions and then at the next turn (turn t1+H) we are at 9? But the problem says \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\".\n\nLet me read the problem again: \n  \"such that y_{t1+H-1} = 9\"\n\nand the action sequence is for turns t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nBut note: the position at the start of turn t1 is given as (0,3). Then we take an action at turn t1, which leads to y_{t1+1}. Then at the start of turn t1+1, we are at y_{t1+1}. \n\nSo the position at the start of turn t1+k is y_{t1+k}. \n\nWe require that at the start of turn t1+H-1, we are at 9? But then we are going to take an action at turn t1+H-1? And that action might move us away? \n\nThat doesn't make sense for reaching (0,9) as the final position.\n\nI think there might be a misunderstanding. Let me look at the problem statement: \n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nand then: \"such that y_{t1+H-1} = 9\"\n\nBut note: the goal is to be at (0,9). The problem does not specify at which turn we must be at (0,9). It says \"reach (0,9)\", meaning we are at (0,9) at some turn. But the condition is that at turn t1+H-1, we are at 9.\n\nBut the minimal H would be the minimal number of actions to get to 9? \n\nThe minimal moves to go from 3 to 9 is 6 moves (all U). But we have obstacles.\n\nBut the problem says: the sequence of actions is for t=0 to H-1, meaning H actions. And we require that after these H actions, the position at turn t1+H is not 9, but the position at turn t1+H-1 is 9? \n\nThis is confusing.\n\nLet me try to clarify with the update:\n\nAt turn t1 (3): we are at y3 = 3.\nWe take action a3 at turn 3: then y4 = y3 + Δy3.\nWe take action a4 at turn 4: then y5 = y4 + Δy4.\n...\nWe take action a_{3+H-1} at turn 3+H-1: then y_{3+H} = y_{3+H-1} + Δy_{3+H-1}.\n\nThe problem requires y_{3+H-1} = 9? Then the last action (at turn 3+H-1) would be taken from 9? And then we move to y_{3+H} = 9 + Δy, which might be 10 or 8 or 9? But we want to be at 9 at the end? \n\nThis does not make sense.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might mean that we must be at 9 at the beginning of turn 3+H-1? Then we don't take an action at turn 3+H-1? But the sequence includes an action at turn 3+H-1.\n\nI think there is a mistake in the problem statement. \n\nLooking at the answer format: \n  Turn t1: a_{t1}\n  Turn t1+1: a_{t1+1}\n  ...\n  Turn t1+H-1: a_{t1+H-1}\n\nAnd then we stop. So the last action is at turn t1+H-1, and the position after that action is at turn t1+H. \n\nBut the problem says: \"such that y_{t1+H-1} = 9\", which is the position at the beginning of turn t1+H-1. \n\nThis means that we require to be at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, and then we take an action at turn t1+H-1? That action will then move us away? \n\nThat does not make sense.\n\nPerhaps the problem is: we want to be at (0,9) at the turn when we have taken the last action, i.e., at turn t1+H (after the last action). \n\nBut the problem explicitly says: \"such that y_{t1+H-1} = 9\".\n\nAnother possibility: the indexing of turns might be such that the position is updated immediately after the action in the same turn? But the update rule says: \"y_{t+1} = y_t + ...\", so the new position is at the next turn.\n\nGiven the confusion, I will assume that the intended meaning is that we require the player to be at y=9 at the beginning of turn t1+H. That is, after H actions, we are at y_{t1+H} = 9.\n\nWhy? Because the goal is to reach (0,9) and we start at turn t1 at y=3. After H actions (t1 to t1+H-1), we have moved to y_{t1+H}. And we want that to be 9.\n\nBut the problem says \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\". \n\nLet me see if there is an example in the problem? There isn't.\n\nLooking at the collision rule: \n  \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T\"\n\nThis happens at the turn T when the player is at (0, y_T). And at the beginning of turn T, the player is at y_T. Then we take an action and move.\n\nSo for the goal, we want to be at (0,9) at some turn T. And at that turn T, we must not collide with any car on freeway 9? But note the freeways are from 1 to 8. Freeway 9 doesn't exist? Actually, the grid has y=0,1,...,9. The freeways with cars are y=1..8. So at y=9, there are no cars. Similarly, y=0 has no cars? \n\nThe problem says: \"avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y = 1, ..., 8\". So when we are on y=0 or y=9, there are no cars to collide.\n\nTherefore, we can be at y=9 safely.\n\nBut the problem says: we must avoid collisions on the freeways we traverse. When we are at a freeway k (1<=k<=8) at turn T, we must not have 0 in the car span of any car on freeway k at turn T.\n\nNow, back to the goal: we want to be at (0,9) at the end. The problem says we must be at y_{t1+H-1}=9. But that would mean at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at 9. Then we take an action at turn t1+H-1? And then move to y_{t1+H} which might be 8,9, or 10 (but 10 is invalid). \n\nBut if we are already at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, and we take an action, we might move away. So then we are not at 9 at the end of the sequence.\n\nThis suggests that the problem might mean that we are to be at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H, i.e., after the last action we are at 9.\n\nGiven the confusion, I will look at the minimal H. \n\nWithout obstacles, to go from 3 to 9: we need 6 moves of U. Then we would be at y_{3+6} = y9 = 9. So H=6 actions: at turns 3,4,5,6,7,8. Then at turn 9, we are at y9=9.\n\nBut the problem says: the sequence is for t=0 to H-1, so H=6 actions: \n  a3, a4, a5, a6, a7, a8.\n\nThen the final position is at turn 9 (t1+H = 3+6 = 9).\n\nAnd the problem requires y_{t1+H-1} = y_{8} = 9? But then at turn 8, we would be at 9, and then at turn 8 we take an action? That would be the last action (a8) which would then move us to y9 = 9 + Δy8. If we choose U at turn8 and we are at 9, then we cannot go up, so we might choose S or D? But then we would not be at 9 at turn9.\n\nThis is very confusing.\n\nLet me re-read the problem: \n  \"such that y_{t1+H-1} = 9\"\n\nand the actions are from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nBut note: the position y_t is defined at the beginning of turn t. At the beginning of turn t1, we are at y_{t1}=3. \nAfter action at turn t1, we get to y_{t1+1} at the beginning of turn t1+1.\n\nSo after H actions, we are at the beginning of turn t1+H.\n\nBut the problem requires that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at 9? \n\nThis means that after H-1 actions, we are at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1. Then we take one more action at turn t1+H-1, which might move us away from 9.\n\nThat doesn't make sense for the goal.\n\nUnless the goal is to be at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, and then we don't care about the last action? But the problem says to reach (0,9) and then stop. And the sequence has H actions, including one at turn t1+H-1.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, I will assume that the intended goal is to be at y=9 at the beginning of turn t1+H. That is, after H actions, we are at y_{t1+H} = 9.\n\nThis is the natural interpretation: we start at turn t1 at y_{t1}=3, and after H actions (at turns t1 to t1+H-1), we are at y_{t1+H}=9.\n\nThen the condition is y_{t1+H} = 9.\n\nAnd the problem's requirement \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\" might be a typo and should be \"y_{t1+H}=9\".\n\nOtherwise, the problem doesn't make sense.\n\nSo I will proceed with: we require y_{3+H} = 9.\n\nAnd the minimal H is the smallest such that there is a sequence of actions of length H that moves from y3=3 to y_{3+H}=9 without colliding.\n\nThe minimal steps without obstacles is 6 (all U).\n\nBut we have to avoid the cars on the freeways 1 to 8.\n\nLet's compute the car positions at future turns.\n\nWe are at turn 3. We will simulate turns 4,5,6,... until we find a safe path to 9.\n\nThe cars:\n\nFor each freeway k (1 to 8), we have a list of cars. Each car is (head, tail, direction, speed). All are right-moving.\n\nFor a car (h, τ, 'right', s) at turn 3, at turn T (>=3), the span is:\n  [τ + s*(T-3), h + s*(T-3)]\n\nWe care about whether 0 is in this span at turn T.\n\nNote: the span is a continuous interval. We require that 0 is NOT in the span for any car on the freeway k at the turn T when the player is on freeway k.\n\nThe player is on freeway k at turn T if y_T = k.\n\nWe start at turn 3 at y=3.\n\nWe can only move up, down, or stay.\n\nWe need to go from 3 to 9, so we must eventually move up.\n\nThe minimal H is 6, but we must check if moving up at every step from turn 3 to turn 8 (6 actions) is safe.\n\nLet's simulate for freeway 3 to freeway 8 at turns when we might be there.\n\nWe plan to move: \n  turn3: action U -> then at turn4, we are at y4=4.\n  turn4: action U -> at turn5, y5=5.\n  turn5: action U -> at turn6, y6=6.\n  turn6: action U -> at turn7, y7=7.\n  turn7: action U -> at turn8, y8=8.\n  turn8: action U -> at turn9, y9=9.\n\nBut note: we are at freeway 4 at turn4, freeway5 at turn5, ... freeway8 at turn8.\n\nWe need to check for each of these freeways at that turn if there is a car covering 0.\n\nLet's compute for freeway k at turn T = k? Not exactly: \n  turn4: we are at freeway 4.\n  turn5: freeway 5.\n  turn6: freeway 6.\n  turn7: freeway 7.\n  turn8: freeway 8.\n\nSo we need to check freeway 4 at turn4, freeway5 at turn5, etc.\n\nFreeway 1 to 3: we are not on them after turn3 (we start at 3 at turn3, then move to 4 at turn4, so we are at freeway3 only at turn3). But we start at 3 at turn3, so we must check freeway3 at turn3.\n\nAt turn3, we are at freeway3. Is there a car on freeway3 at turn3 that covers 0?\n\nFreeway3: only one car: (-36, -47, right, 4) -> at turn3: span = [tail + 0, head + 0] = [-47, -36]. So 0 is not in [-47, -36]. So safe.\n\nNow, freeway4 at turn4:\n\nFreeway4 has three cars: \n  car1: (-36, -47, right, 4)\n  car2: (0, -11, right, 4)\n  car3: (36, 25, right, 4)\n\nAt turn T=4: \n  time passed: T-3 = 1.\n\ncar1: [ -47 + 4*1, -36 + 4*1] = [-43, -32] -> 0 not in it.\ncar2: [ -11 + 4*1, 0 + 4*1] = [-7, 4] -> 0 is in [-7,4]? Yes, because -7<=0<=4.\ncar3: [25+4, 36+4] = [29,40] -> no.\n\nSo at turn4, freeway4 has a car (car2) that covers 0. Therefore, if we are on freeway4 at turn4, we collide.\n\nTherefore, the straight path is not safe.\n\nWe must avoid being on freeway4 at turn4.\n\nSo we need to adjust.\n\nWe might delay moving up at some turns or move down to avoid being on a freeway at a turn when it is occupied.\n\nWe are at turn3: y3=3.\n\nWe have to choose an action: U, D, or S.\n\nIf we go up at turn3, then at turn4 we are at y4=4 -> collides.\n\nSo we cannot go up at turn3.\n\nAlternatives: \n  - Stay at turn3: then at turn4, we are at y4=3. Then we are on freeway3 at turn4. Check freeway3 at turn4.\n\n    Freeway3: only one car: (-36,-47,right,4) -> at T=4: [-47+4, -36+4] = [-43,-32] -> 0 not in it. Safe.\n\n    Then at turn4, we are at 3. Then we can try to go up at turn4? Then at turn5, we go to 4.\n\n    But then we are at freeway4 at turn5.\n\n    Check freeway4 at turn5 (T=5, so T-3=2):\n\n        car1: [-47+8, -36+8] = [-39, -28] -> safe.\n        car2: [-11+8, 0+8] = [-3, 8] -> 0 is in [-3,8]? Yes.\n        car3: [25+8, 36+8] = [33,44] -> safe.\n\n    So at turn5, freeway4 is still unsafe.\n\n  - Or go down at turn3: to y4=2. Then at turn4, we are at freeway2.\n\n    Freeway2: only one car: (-36,-47,right,12) -> at T=4: [-47+12, -36+12] = [-35, -24] -> safe.\n\n    Then at turn4, we are at 2. Then we can go up at turn4 to 3 at turn5.\n\n    Then at turn5, freeway3: T=5 -> car: [-47+8, -36+8] = [-39,-28] -> safe.\n\n    Then at turn5, we are at 3. Then we can go up at turn5 to 4 at turn6.\n\n    Then at turn6, freeway4: T=6 (T-3=3): \n        car1: [-47+12, -36+12] = [-35,-24] -> safe.\n        car2: [-11+12, 0+12] = [1,12] -> 0 not in [1,12] -> safe.\n        car3: [25+12, 36+12] = [37,48] -> safe.\n\n    So at turn6, freeway4 is safe.\n\n    Then we can continue: \n        turn6: at 4 -> action U to 5 at turn7.\n        turn7: at 5 -> check freeway5 at turn7 (T=7, T-3=4)\n\n        Freeway5: three cars:\n            car1: (-36,-47,right,4) -> at T=7: [-47+16, -36+16] = [-31, -20] -> safe.\n            car2: (0,-11,right,4) -> [-11+16, 0+16] = [5,16] -> safe.\n            car3: (36,25,right,4) -> [25+16, 36+16] = [41,52] -> safe.\n\n        Then at turn7: action U to 6 at turn8.\n        turn8: at 6 -> freeway6 at turn8 (T=8, T-3=5): \n            car1: [-47+20, -36+20] = [-27,-16] -> safe.\n            car2: [-11+20, 0+20] = [9,20] -> safe.\n            car3: [25+20, 36+20] = [45,56] -> safe.\n\n        Then at turn8: action U to 7 at turn9.\n        turn9: at 7 -> freeway7 at turn9 (T=9, T-3=6): \n            Freeway7: only one car: (-36,-47,right,4) -> [-47+24, -36+24] = [-23,-12] -> safe.\n\n        Then at turn9: action U to 8 at turn10.\n        turn10: at 8 -> freeway8 at turn10 (T=10, T-3=7): \n            Freeway8: one car: (-36,-47,right,4) -> [-47+28, -36+28] = [-19,-8] -> safe.\n\n        Then at turn10: action U to 9 at turn11.\n\n        So we reached 9 at turn11.\n\n        Total actions: from turn3 to turn10 (8 actions): \n            turn3: D -> to 2 at turn4\n            turn4: U -> to 3 at turn5\n            turn5: U -> to 4 at turn6\n            turn6: U -> to 5 at turn7\n            turn7: U -> to 6 at turn8\n            turn8: U -> to 7 at turn9\n            turn9: U -> to 8 at turn10\n            turn10: U -> to 9 at turn11\n\n        H = 8 actions? But we are at 9 at turn11, which is after 8 actions.\n\n        The problem requires the position at turn t1+H-1 = 3+8-1 = 10 to be 9? \n        But at turn10, we are at 8 (because we went U at turn10 to become 9 at turn11). \n        So at the beginning of turn10, we were at 8, then we took U and became 9 at turn11.\n\n        But the problem says we require y_{t1+H-1}=y_{10}=9? But we were at 8 at turn10.\n\n        This does not satisfy.\n\n        Alternatively, if we do 7 actions? Then we would be at turn3+7=10, and we require y_{3+7-1}=y_{9}=9? \n        But in our sequence, at turn9 we were at 7, then we took U to go to 8 at turn10.\n\n        So at turn9, we are at 7, not 9.\n\n        We need to be at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1.\n\n        Let me reframe: \n          We are at turn3: y3=3.\n          After 1 action (at turn3): y4 = ... \n          We want after H actions to have y_{3+H} = 9? But the problem says y_{3+H-1}=9.\n\n        Given the problem says y_{t1+H-1}=9, then we require that at the beginning of turn 3+H-1, we are at 9.\n\n        In our plan above, we are at 9 at turn11. So at the beginning of turn11, we are at 9. \n        Then we don't need to take an action at turn11? But our sequence has 8 actions, from turn3 to turn10.\n\n        Then the beginning of turn11 is after 8 actions, and we are at 9. \n\n        But the last action was at turn10. \n\n        So the beginning of turn11 is y11=9.\n\n        Then the condition is y_{3+8-1} = y_{10} = 9? \n        But 3+8-1 = 10, and we are at y10=8? \n\n        We want y_{t1+H-1}=y_{3+H-1}=9.\n\n        In our sequence, we are at 9 at turn11. So to have y_{3+H-1}=9, we set 3+H-1 = 11 -> H-1 = 8 -> H=9.\n\n        But then we would have 9 actions. The 9th action would be at turn3+8 = turn11? But then at turn11 we take an action, and then at turn12 we move. But we are already at 9 at the beginning of turn11.\n\n        We don't want to move away.\n\n        So we could do at turn11: action S, then y12=9. But then we are at 9 at turn12, not at turn11.\n\n        The problem says we require to be at 9 at turn t1+H-1. \n\n        So if we want to be at 9 at turn11, then we set t1+H-1=11 -> 3+H-1=11 -> H=9.\n\n        Then the sequence is for actions at turns 3 to 3+8 (9 actions: turns 3,4,...,11).\n\n        And we require that at turn11 (the beginning) we are at 9.\n\n        In our plan, we became 9 at turn11 (without an action at turn11). But how? \n\n        The last action was at turn10: we did U from 8 to 9, so at turn11 we are at 9.\n\n        So then the action at turn11 is not needed? But the sequence must have H=9 actions? \n\n        This is messy.\n\n        Alternatively, we can do 8 actions and be at 9 at turn11, which is the beginning of turn11. Then we don't need an action at turn11. But the sequence is for turns 3 to 3+7 (8 actions) and then at turn11 we are at 9.\n\n        But the problem requires the sequence to have H actions and then we are at 9 at turn t1+H-1.\n\n        For our 8 actions: \n          t1+H-1 = 3+8-1 = 10.\n          We are at turn10: we were at 8 (because at turn10 we are at 8, then we took U and became 9 at turn11).\n\n        So y10=8, not 9.\n\n        Therefore, to be at 9 at turn10, we need to arrive at 9 earlier.\n\n        We need to reach 9 by turn10.\n\n        How many actions does that take? \n          From 3 to 9: 6 steps up. \n          So we must do 6 U actions, but we may have to wait sometimes.\n\n        We are at turn3: y3=3.\n        We want y10=9.\n\n        We have 7 actions: turns3 to turn9.\n\n        And then at turn10, we are at y10 = y9 + Δy9.\n\n        We require y10=9.\n\n        So we require y9=9 and then we do S? Or we could be at 8 at turn9 and then do U at turn9 to get to 9 at turn10.\n\n        But the condition is y10=9.\n\n        So we can achieve it in 7 actions: \n          actions at turns3,4,5,6,7,8,9 -> 7 actions, then at turn10 we are at the new position.\n\n        We require y10=9.\n\n        How to achieve that in 7 actions? \n\n        We start at 3 at turn3.\n        After 7 actions, we are at turn10.\n\n        The net displacement must be +6.\n\n        So we need at least 6 U actions and one extra action that is not U? But we can also have S or D, but then we need extra U to compensate.\n\n        The minimal number of U is 6, so we must have 6 U and one other action. The other action could be S or D.\n\n        But if we do D, then we have to do an extra U to compensate, so total moves would be 7: 6U and 1D? Then net +5, not 6.\n\n        Or 7U? But 7U is not possible because we can only go up to 9.\n\n        Actually, if we are at 9, we cannot go up. So we can only do S or D.\n\n        Therefore, to have net +6 in 7 actions, we must have 6U and 1S (or 6U and 1D which would give net +5, not enough).\n\n        So the only possibility is 6U and 1S.\n\n        We need to insert one S somewhere.\n\n        We have to avoid freeway4 at turn4 and turn5 (because we saw it's occupied).\n\n        Let me check freeway4 at turn6: we saw at turn6 (T=6) it was safe.\n\n        We also need to check other freeways.\n\n        We need to plan a path that uses 6U and 1S in 7 actions, and reaches 9 at turn10.\n\n        The positions:\n\n          turn3: y3=3\n          turn4: y4 = 3 + a3\n          turn5: y5 = y4 + a4\n          turn6: y6 = y5 + a5\n          turn7: y7 = y6 + a6\n          turn8: y8 = y7 + a7\n          turn9: y9 = y8 + a8\n          turn10: y10 = y9 + a9\n\n        But we only have actions at turns3 to turn9 (7 actions). Then y10 = y9 + a9.\n\n        We require y10=9.\n\n        We have to choose the actions.\n\n        One S and six U's.\n\n        We can try to delay the first move to avoid freeway4 at turn4.\n\n        Option: \n          turn3: S -> then y4=3.\n          turn4: U -> y5=4.\n          turn5: U -> y6=5.\n          turn6: U -> y7=6.\n          turn7: U -> y8=7.\n          turn8: U -> y9=8.\n          turn9: U -> y10=9.\n\n        But this has 6U and 1S, so net +6.\n\n        Check collisions:\n\n          turn3: at freeway3: safe (as before).\n          turn4: at freeway3: safe (as before, freeway3 at turn4: [-43,-32]).\n          turn5: at freeway4: turn5 (T=5) -> freeway4: car2 spans [-3,8] -> 0 in it -> collision.\n\n        So not safe.\n\n        Another option: \n          turn3: U -> would collide at turn4 (freeway4) -> not safe.\n\n        Another: \n          turn3: D -> y4=2.\n          turn4: U -> y5=3.\n          turn5: U -> y6=4 -> at turn6, freeway4: T=6: safe (as before: car2 at [1,12], 0 not in it).\n          turn6: U -> y7=5.\n          turn7: U -> y8=6.\n          turn8: U -> y9=7.\n          turn9: U -> y10=8. -> but we need to be at 9 at turn10? \n\n        We are at 8 at turn10. \n\n        But we have used one D and six U's: net change: 6U -1D = +5, so we are at 3+5=8.\n\n        We need one more U, but we have used 7 actions already.\n\n        So not enough.\n\n        We must not use a D if we want net +6.\n\n        So we must use only U and S.\n\n        We need to insert the S at a point where we are not on a dangerous freeway.\n\n        We have to avoid freeway4 at turns4 and5.\n\n        We can try:\n\n          turn3: S -> y4=3.\n          turn4: S -> y5=3.\n          turn5: U -> y6=4.  // at turn6, freeway4: T=6: safe.\n          turn6: U -> y7=5.\n          turn7: U -> y8=6.\n          turn8: U -> y9=7.\n          turn9: U -> y10=8. // not 9.\n\n        Net: 5U and 2S -> net +5, so only to 8.\n\n        Not enough.\n\n        Or:\n\n          turn3: U -> collides at turn4.\n\n        Not safe.\n\n        Try to be on freeway4 at a later turn.\n\n        We need to be at freeway4 only at turn6 or later.\n\n        So we can do:\n\n          turn3: S -> y4=3.\n          turn4: U -> y5=4. // turn5: freeway4: unsafe.\n          -> not safe.\n\n        turn3: S -> y4=3.\n          turn4: U -> y5=4. // unsafe.\n\n        turn3: D -> y4=2.\n          turn4: U -> y5=3.\n          turn5: S -> y6=3. // then we are at freeway3 at turn6: safe.\n          turn6: U -> y7=4. // at turn7, freeway4: T=7: car2: [ -11+4*(7-3)= -11+16=5, 0+16=16] = [5,16] -> safe.\n          turn7: U -> y8=5.\n          turn8: U -> y9=6.\n          turn9: U -> y10=7. // not 9.\n\n        Net: 4U, 1D, 2S -> net +3 -> 3+3=6, not 9.\n\n        This is taking too long. We need to do more U's.\n\n        We have to minimize the waiting.\n\n        How about we do not wait at the beginning, but in the middle.\n\n        We must do 6U and 1S. Let's try to do the S at a turn where we are on a safe freeway.\n\n        For example, at turn6, if we are on freeway6, is it safe? \n\n        freeway6 at turn6: T=6, T-3=3.\n        Freeway6: three cars: \n            car1: (-36,-47,right,4) -> [-47+12, -36+12] = [-35,-24] -> safe.\n            car2: (0,-11,right,4) -> [-11+12, 0+12] = [1,12] -> safe.\n            car3: (36,25,right,4) -> [25+12, 36+12] = [37,48] -> safe.\n\n        freeway5 at turn5: \n            T=5, T-3=2.\n            car1: [-47+8, -36+8] = [-39,-28] -> safe.\n            car2: [-11+8,0+8] = [-3,8] -> unsafe (0 in it).\n\n        freeway5 at turn6: \n            T=6, T-3=3.\n            car1: [-47+12, -36+12] = [-35,-24] -> safe.\n            car2: [-11+12,0+12] = [1,12] -> safe.\n            car3: [25+12,36+12] = [37,48] -> safe.\n        so freeway5 at turn6 is safe.\n\n        freeway7 at turn7: \n            T=7, T-3=4.\n            car: [-47+16, -36+16] = [-31,-20] -> safe.\n\n        freeway8 at turn8: \n            T=8, T-3=5.\n            car: [-47+20, -36+20] = [-27,-16] -> safe.\n\n        freeway4 at turn>=6 is safe (at turn6 onward).\n\n        freeway3 at any turn we've seen is safe.\n\n        freeway2: \n            only one car: (-36,-47,right,12)\n            at turn4: [-47+12, -36+12] = [-35,-24] -> safe.\n            at turn5: [-47+24, -36+24] = [-23,-12] -> safe.\n            at turn6: [-47+36, -36+36] = [-11,0] -> does this include 0? \n                span is [-11,0] -> 0 is included. So at turn6, freeway2 is unsafe.\n\n        freeway1: \n            has three cars.\n            We care only if we are on freeway1.\n            car2: (0,-11,right,4) -> at turn4: [-7,4] (includes0), turn5: [-3,8] (includes0), turn6: [1,12] (safe), etc.\n\n        So to avoid freeway4 at turns4 and5, we can try to be at freeway5 at turn6, freeway6 at turn7, etc.\n\n        Plan with 6U and 1S, and we want to be at 9 at turn10.\n\n        We need to cover +6 in 7 actions: so the S must be inserted somewhere safe.\n\n        Try to spend an extra turn at a safe freeway.\n\n        For example, at freeway3: we know turn3 and turn4 are safe.\n\n        Or at freeway5: turn6 is safe.\n\n        Let me try:\n\n          turn3: U -> to 4 at turn4: collides. -> not good.\n\n          turn3: S -> then turn4: y=3.\n          turn4: U -> to 4 at turn5: collides (freeway4 at turn5 is unsafe).\n\n          turn3: D -> to 2 at turn4.\n          turn4: U -> to 3 at turn5.\n          turn5: U -> to 4 at turn6: safe (freeway4 at turn6 is safe).\n          then we continue: \n             turn6: U to 5 at turn7: safe.\n             turn7: U to 6 at turn8: safe.\n             turn8: U to 7 at turn9: safe.\n             turn9: U to 8 at turn10: safe.\n          then we are at 8 at turn10. We need to be at 9 at turn10, but we are at 8.\n\n        We need an extra U, but we have used 6 actions ( turns3 to turn8) and we have one action left at turn9: we can do U to 9 at turn10.\n\n        So then the sequence: \n          turn3: D\n          turn4: U\n          turn5: U\n          turn6: U\n          turn7: U\n          turn8: U\n          turn9: U\n\n        Actions: 6U and 1D.\n\n        Net: +5, so we are at 3+5=8 at turn10.\n\n        Not 9.\n\n        turn3: D (1D)\n        turn4: U (1U) -> net -1+1=0, still at 3? \n          No: \n             at turn3: y3=3.\n             action D: y4=2.\n             action U: y5=3.\n             action U: y6=4.\n             ...\n\n        So after two actions, we are back at 3.\n\n        then from there we do 6U: \n          turn5: U -> y6=4\n          turn6: U -> y7=5\n          turn7: U -> y8=6\n          turn8: U -> y9=7\n          turn9: U -> y10=8\n\n        still 8.\n\n        We need an seventh U, but we are at 8 at turn10, and we can do U at turn10 to get to 9 at turn11, but then we are at 9 at turn11, not turn10.\n\n        Given the problem requires to be at 9 at turn10, we must have y10=9.\n\n        So we must have at turn10 we are at 9.\n\n        Therefore, the last action (at turn9) must move us to 9.\n\n        So at turn9, we must be at 8 or 9. \n          If at 8, then U to 9.\n          If at 9, then S to 9.\n\n        So we can be at 8 at turn9 and then U, or at 9 at turn9 and then S.\n\n        net requirement: at the beginning of turn9, we must be at 8 or 9.\n\n        to be at 8 or 9 at turn9, we need to have moved net +5 or +6 from turn3 to turn9 (6 actions: turns3 to turn8).\n\n        +5: 5U and 1 other (S or D) -> but then we have used 6 actions and have net +5, so at turn9 we are at 3+5=8.\n        +6: 6U -> at turn9 we are at 9.\n\n        So either:\n          Option1: 6U in the first 6 actions, then at turn9 we are at 9, and then we do S at turn9 to stay at 9.\n          Option2: 5U and 1S in the first 6 actions, then at turn9 we are at 8, and then we do U at turn9 to get to 9 at turn10.\n\n        But note: in Option1, we would be at 9 at turn9 (from the action at turn8) and then at turn9 we do S, then at turn10 we are still at 9.\n\n        So both satisfy y10=9.\n\n        However, in Option1, we are at freeway9 at turn9 and turn10, but freeway9 has no cars, so safe.\n\n        But can we do 6U in a row without\n        We try Option1: 6U from turn3 to turn8.\n\n        turn3: U -> to 4 at turn4: collides at freeway4 turn4.\n\n        not safe.\n\n        Option2: 5U and 1S in the first 6 actions, and then a U at turn9.\n\n        The net from the first 6 actions is +5, so we are at 8 at turn9.\n\n        We need to distribute the 1S in the first 6 actions.\n\n        We have to avoid freeway4 at turn4 and turn5.\n\n        Let me try to do the S at a safe spot.\n\n        For example, at turn3: S, then we are at 3 at turn4.\n        turn4: U -> to 4 at turn5: freeway4 at turn5 is unsafe.\n\n        turn3: U -> unsafe.\n\n        turn3: D -> then we are at 2 at turn4.\n        turn4: U -> to 3 at turn5.\n        turn5: now we can do S: stay at 3 at turn6.

\n        But at turn10, we are at 8 (because we take U at turn10 to become 9 at turn11).\n\n        So not.\n\n        to have y_{3+H-1}=y_{10}=9, we need to be at 9 at turn10.\n\n        then we must have taken the action to arrive at 9 by turn10.\n\n        In the above, we are at 9 at turn11.\n\n        So to be at 9 at turn10, we need to do the last U at turn9.\n\n        then the sequence for 8 actions ( to be at 9 at turn10) should be:\n\n          turn3: S\n          turn4: S\n          turn5: U // to 4 at turn6: safe.\n          turn6: U // to 5 at turn7: safe.\n          turn7: U // to 6 at turn8: safe.\n          turn8: U // to 7 at turn9: safe.\n          turn9: U // to 8 at turn10 -> not 9.\n\n        or \n\n          turn3: S\n          turn4: S\n          turn5: U // to 4 at turn6\n          turn6: U // to 5 at turn7\n          turn7: U // to 6 at turn8\n          turn8: U // to 7 at turn9\n          turn9: U // to 8 at turn10\n          // missing one U to get to 9.\n\n        So we need to do 6U in the 8 actions, then net +6.\n\n        So two more U's.\n\n        But we can't because we only have 8 actions.\n\n        We have 8 actions: we can do 6U and 2S.\n\n        In the above, we have 5U and 2S.\n\n        So one more U.\n\n        turn3: S\n          turn4: U // unsafe at turn5 ( freeway4 at turn5) -> not safe.\n\n        not possible.\n\n        turn3: D // to 2 at turn4.\n          turn4: U // to 3 at turn5.\n          turn5: U // to 4 at turn6: safe.\n          turn6: U // to 5 at turn7.\n          turn7: U // to 6 at turn8.\n          turn8: U // to 7 at turn9.\n          turn9: U // to 8 at turn10.\n        net: -1+6 = +5 -> at 8 at turn10.\n\n        then not 9.\n\n        turn3: D\n          turn4: U\n          turn5: U\n          turn6: U\n          turn7: U\n          turn8: U\n          turn9: U // to 9 at turn10.\n        net: -1+6 =+5, so at 3+5=8 at turn10?

-> y10=8, not 9.\n\n        or if we do 9 actions, then we require y_{3+9-1}=y11=9.\n\n        So if we do 9 actions, then we can have:\n\n          actions: turns3 to turn11 (9 actions) -> and we want y11=9.\n\n        In the above, we are at 9 at turn11, so we can do:\n\n          turn3: S\n          turn4: S\n          turn5: U // to 4 at turn6\n          turn6: U // to 5 at turn7\n          turn7: U // to 6 at turn8\n          turn8: U // to 7 at turn9\n          turn9: U // to 8 at turn10\n          turn10: U // to 9 at turn11\n          turn11: action not needed? but we must do an action at turn11? \n\n        then at turn11, we take an action, and then at turn12 we move.\n\n        to have y11=9, we must be at 9 at the beginning of turn11.\n\n        in the above, at the beginning of turn11, we are at 8 ( because at turn10 we were at 8, then we took U and became 9 at turn11).\n\n        so at the beginning of turn11, we are at 8.\n\n        then we take an action at turn11: we can do U (invalid) or D or S.\n\n        if we do S, then at turn12 we are at 8? or if we do S at 8, we stay at 8.\n\n        not 9.\n\n        if we do U at turn11: then we are at 9 at turn12.\n\n        then we would be at 9 at turn12.\n\n        For 9 actions, we require y_{3+9-1}=y11=9.\n\n        but we are at 8 at turn11.\n\n        So not.\n\n        to be at 9 at turn11, we need to have gotten to 9 by turn11.\n\n        so the last action that moves us to 9 must be at turn10.\n\n        then the position at turn11 = 9.\n\n        in the sequence above, we moved to 9 at turn11 by the action at turn10.\n\n        so at the beginning of turn11, we are at 9.\n\n        Therefore, for the sequence of 8 actions ( turns3 to turn10), we become 9 at turn11.\n\n        then we have H=8 actions.\n\n        and we require y_{t1+H-1} = y_{3+8-1}=y10= ? \n          at turn10, we are at 8.\n\n        but we want y10=9.\n\n        So it does not satisfy.\n\n        unless the problem means that we are at 9 at turn t1+H.\n\n        Given the only way to resolve the indexing is to assume that the intended condition is to be at 9 at turn t1+H, then we can use the 8-action sequence and be at 9 at turn11=3+8.\n\n        then we would output the 8 actions.\n\n        and H=8.\n\n        and in the answer, we list actions for turn3 to turn10.\n\n        then the position at turn11 is 9.\n\n        and the problem's \"y_{t1+H-1}\" would be y_{10}=8, but we hope that is a typo.\n\n        Given the problem says \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\", and in our sequence we have y10=8, it does not meet.\n\n        I think the only way is to output the sequence that gets to 9 at turn11 and assume that the condition is for turn t1+H.\n\n        Or to do 9 actions and then be at 9 at turn12, and set H=9, then we require y_{3+9-1}=y11=9.\n\n        In the sequence above, we can do an extra S at the end:\n\n          turn3: S\n          turn4: S\n          turn5: U // to 4 at turn6\n          turn6: U // to 5 at turn7\n          turn7: U // to 6 at turn8\n          turn8: U // to 7 at turn9\n          turn9: U // to 8 at turn10\n          turn10: U // to 9 at turn11\n          turn11: S // then at turn12, we are at 9.\n        but we want y11=9.\n\n        at the beginning of turn11, we are at 9 ( from the action at turn10).\n\n        then at turn11, we do S, and then at turn12 we are still at 9.\n\n        but the problem only requires to reach (0,9) and then we stop. \n        but the condition is that at turn t1+H-1=3+9-1=11, we are at 9.\n\n        So this meets: at turn11, we are at 9.\n\n        then the sequence has 9 actions: from turn3 to turn11.\n\n        and we do: \n          turn3: S\n          turn4: S\n          turn5: U\n          turn6: U\n          turn7: U\n          turn8: U\n          turn9: U\n          turn10: U\n          turn11: S\n\n        But wait, at turn10: we are at 8, and we do U to get to 9 at turn11.\n        then at turn11: we are at 9, and we do S to stay.\n\n        then at turn12, we are at 9.\n\n        but the condition is only for turn11: we are at 9, which is true.\n\n        So this works.\n\n        Now check if it is safe.\n\n        We need to check each turn when we are on a freeway 1-8.\n\n        turn3: y3=3 -> freeway3: safe.\n        turn4: y4=3 ( after S) -> freeway3: at T=4: car: [-47+4, -36+4] = [-43, -32] -> safe.\n        turn5: y5=3 ( after S) -> freeway3: at T=5: [-47+8, -36+8] = [-39, -28] -> safe.\n        turn6: y6=4 ( after U at turn5) -> freeway4: at T=6: \n              car1: [-47+12, -36+12] = [-35,-24] -> safe.\n              car2: [-11+12,0+12] = [1,12] -> safe.\n              car3: [25+12,36+12] = [37,48] -> safe.\n        turn7: y7=5 ( after U) -> freeway5: at T=7: \n              car1: [-47+16, -36+16] = [-31, -20] -> safe.\n              car2: [-11+16,0+16] = [5,16] -> safe.\n              car3: [25+16,36+16] = [41,52] -> safe.\n        turn8: y8=6 ( after U) -> freeway6: at T=8: \n              car1: [-47+20, -36+20] = [-27,-16] -> safe.\n              car2: [-11+20,0+20] = [9,20] -> safe.\n              car3: [25+20,36+20] = [45,56] -> safe.\n        turn9: y9=7 ( after U) -> freeway7: at T=9: \n              car: [-47+24, -36+24] = [-23,-12] -> safe.\n        turn10: y10=8 ( after U) -> freeway8: at T=10: \n              car: [-47+28, -36+28] = [-19, -8] -> safe.\n        turn11: y11=9 -> no car ( freeway9 not exists) -> safe.\n\n        So the sequence is safe.\n\n        Therefore, H=9.\n\n        Actions:\n          turn3: S\n          turn4: S\n          turn5: U\n          turn6: U\n          turn7: U\n          turn8: U\n          turn9: U\n          turn10: U\n          turn11: S\n\n        But wait, the last action at turn11 is S, and we are at 9, so we could any action, but S is safe.\n\n        However, the problem asks for a sequence to reach (0,9) and we reached at turn11 ( by the action at turn10), and then at turn11 we are at 9 and we do S to stay.\n\n        This is safe and meets the condition.\n\n        But is there a shorter H? \n          We have H=9.\n          Is there a sequence with H=8?\n\n          If we do not do the last S, then we would have 8 actions: \n             turn3: S\n             turn4: S\n             turn5: U\n             turn6: U\n             turn7: U\n             turn8: U\n             turn9: U\n             turn10: U\n          then at turn11, we are at 9, so we have reached.\n          but the sequence has 8 actions, and we require to output the actions from turn3 to turn10.\n\n          then the condition: y_{3+8-1}=y10=8, but we want it to be 9.\n\n          So it does not meet the problem's condition.\n\n        Therefore, the minimal H is 9.\n\n        So the answer is 9 actions.\n\n        But note: the initial straight plan with waiting only two extra turns and then 6U might be faster, but we saw freeway4 at turn4 and turn5 is unsafe.\n\n        In this plan, we waited at 3 for turns3,4,5 ( three turns) and then moved up.\n\n        We could wait less if we can find a safe spot to wait in between.\n\n        For example, after moving to 4, we might wait at 4 if it is safe at a later turn.\n\n        But at turn6, freeway4 is safe, and onward.\n\n        So we could do:\n\n          turn3: D -> to 2 at turn4.  // safe ( freeway2 at turn4: [-35,-24] -> safe)\n          turn4: U -> to 3 at turn5.  // safe ( freeway3 at turn5: [-39,-28] -> safe)\n          turn5: U -> to 4 at turn6.  // safe ( freeway4 at turn6: safe)\n          then we can do: \n          turn6: S // wait at 4 for one turn. // at turn7, freeway4: safe ( as above)\n          turn7: U // to 5 at turn8.\n          turn8: U // to 6 at turn9.\n          turn9: U // to 7 at turn10.\n          turn10: U // to 8 at turn11.\n          turn11: U // to 9 at turn12.\n\n        then we are at 9 at turn12.\n\n        This is 9 actions: \n          D, U, U, S, U, U, U, U, U.\n\n        net: -1+7 =+6, so at 9 at turn12.\n\n        then to have y_{3+9-1}=y11=9, we are at 8 at turn11 ( because we do U at turn11 to become 9 at turn12) -> not 9.\n\n        not meet.\n\n        to be at 9 at turn11, we need to have done the last U at turn10.\n\n        then the last action is at turn10: U from 8 to 9 at turn11.\n\n        then the sequence of 9 actions would be:\n\n          turn3: D\n          turn4: U\n          turn5: U\n          turn6: U\n          turn7: S // wait at 4 for one turn? \n          // but at turn7, we are at 4? \n          // Let's sim:\n\n          turn3: D -> y4=2.\n          turn4: U -> y5=3.\n          turn5: U -> y6=4.\n          turn6: U -> y7=5.\n          turn7: S -> y8=5.\n          turn8: U -> y9=6.\n          turn9: U -> y10=7.\n          turn10: U -> y11=8.\n          // not 9.\n\n        not.\n\n        turn7: U -> to 5 at turn8.\n          turn8: S // at 5 for turn9.\n          turn9: U // to 6 at turn10.\n          turn10: U // to 7 at turn11.\n          not 9.\n\n        So the first plan with two S at the beginning is valid and safe, and meets the condition for H=9.\n\n        Therefore, the answer is the sequence:\n\n          turn3: S\n          turn4: S\n          turn5: U\n          turn6: U\n          turn7: U\n          turn8: U\n          turn9: U\n          turn10: U\n          turn11: S\n\n        But note, at turn11, we are at 9, and we do S, which is fine.\n\n        However, since we are at 9, we could also do nothing, but S is explicit.\n\n        The problem requires to output the sequence.\n\n        So in the box.\n\n        But is there a sequence with H=8 that meets the condition? \n\n        We would need to be at 9 at turn10 ( because 3+8-1=10).\n\n        and we have 8 actions.\n\n        net +6 in 8 actions: with 6U and 2S.\n\n        Example: \n          turn3: S\n          turn4: S\n          turn5: U\n          turn6: U\n          turn7: U\n          turn8: U\n          turn9: U\n          turn10: U  // but this is 6U and 2S, net +6, so at turn11, we are at 9, not at turn10.\n\n        to be at 9 at turn10, we need net +6 in 7 actions ( because actions from turn3 to turn9: 7 actions determine y10).\n\n        net +6 in 7 actions: 6U and 1S.\n\n        But we cannot do that without passing through freeway4 at an unsafe turn.\n\n        Therefore, H=9 is the minimal.\n\n        So the answer is as above.\n</think>\nTo reach position (0, 9) from (0, 3) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8, the following sequence of actions is required. The cars on each freeway move right at their given speeds, and collision occurs if the player is on a freeway y=k at turn T and 0 is within the span of any car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nThe initial state at turn 3:\n- Player at (0, 3)\n- Freeway 1: [(-36, -47, right, 4), (0, -11, right, 4), (36, 25, right, 4)]\n- Freeway 2: [(-36, -47, right, 12)]\n- Freeway 3: [(-36, -47, right, 4)]\n- Freeway 4: [(-36, -47, right, 4), (0, -11, right, 4), (36, 25, right, 4)]\n- Freeway 5: [(-36, -47, right, 4), (0, -11, right, 4), (36, 25, right, 4)]\n- Freeway 6: [(-36, -47, right, 4), (0, -11, right, 4), (36, 25, right, 4)]\n- Freeway 7: [(-36, -47, right, 4)]\n- Freeway 8: [(-36, -47, right, 4)]\n\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 9, with actions from turn 3 to turn 11.

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get the player from (0,3) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible without colliding with any cars on the freeways y=1 through 8. The current turn is t₁ = 4.\n\nFirst, I should understand how the cars move. All cars are moving right, based on the directions given. The car update rule for right-moving cars is: at turn T, the span is [τ + s(T-t₁), h + s(T-t₁)], where h and τ are the head and tail at t₁.\n\nIn the span, for right-moving, it says [τ, h] → [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT], so τ is the left end and h is the right end? That seems odd because usually head is front. Let me read carefully.\n\nIt says: \"Right-moving: [Span(t₁) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t₁), h + s(T-t₁)]\"\n\nBut in the table, for example, on freeway 1: (-32, -43, right, 4). If τ is tail and h is head, and it's right-moving, so at t₁=4, head is at -32, tail at -43? That would mean the car is from -43 to -32, so head at -32, which is less than tail? That doesn't make sense for right-moving.\n\nPerhaps I misread. Let's see the span: [h, τ] for left-moving, and [τ, h] for right-moving? It says:\n\nLeft-moving: Span(t₁) = [h, τ] → [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT]\n\nRight-moving: Span(t₁) = [τ, h] → [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT]\n\nIn left-moving, [h, τ] with h and τ, but if h is head, for left-moving, head should be on the left? I'm getting confused.\n\nPerhaps I should think of the span as [min, max] for the positions.\n\nFor a right-moving car, at t₁, the span is from left end to right end, so [x_left, x_right], and since it's moving right, x_left and x_right increase with time.\n\nIn the notation, for right-moving, it says Span(t₁) = [τ, h], so τ is the left end (tail?), h is the right end (head?).\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, Span(t₁) = [h, τ], with h head, τ tail, but for left-moving, head might be smaller x if moving left.\n\nTo avoid confusion, let's define the position: the car occupies a set of x positions at time t.\n\nCollision occurs if at turn T, the player is at (0, y_T), and for the car on freeway y_T, 0 is within the car's span at T.\n\nPlayer is at (0, y_t) at turn t, meaning at the beginning of turn t, I think.\n\nThe update: at turn t, player chooses action a_t, which determines Δy_t, so y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nThen, at turn t, the player is at (0, y_t), and if y_t is between 1 and 8, and there is a car on freeway y_t such that 0 is in its span at time t.\n\nThe collision condition: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd y_T is the player's y-position at turn T.\n\nAlso, note: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T\", so at turn T, you are on y_T, and you only check cars on y_T at time T for collision.\n\nWhen you move, at turn T, you are at y_T, you choose action, then at turn T+1, you are at y_{T+1}. So during turn T, you are on row y_T.\n\nFor collision at turn T: you are on freeway y_T, and 0 must not be in the span of any car on that freeway at time T.\n\nNow, for the cars, all are right-moving, from the data.\n\nLet me list all cars per freeway at t₁=4.\n\nFreeway 1: three cars: (head h, tail τ, dir, speed)\n\nFirst car: (-32, -43, right, 4) → since right-moving, span at t₁ is [τ, h] = [-43, -32]\n\nSimilarly, second car: (4, -7, right, 4) → [-7, 4]\n\nThird car: (40, 29, right, 4) → [29, 40]? head 40, tail 29, so if right-moving, head should be larger, so [29,40] makes sense, head at 40.\n\nIn the notation, for right-moving, Span = [τ, h], so τ is left end, h is right end.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 2: (-24, -35, right, 12) → [-35, -24]\n\nFreeway 3: (-32, -43, right, 4) → [-43, -32]\n\nFreeway 4: same as freeway 1: (-32,-43,right,4), (4,-7,right,4), (40,29,right,4) → [-43,-32], [-7,4], [29,40]\n\nFreeway 5: same as above\n\nFreeway 6: same\n\nFreeway 7: (-32,-43,right,4) → [-43,-32]\n\nFreeway 8: (-32,-43,right,4) → [-43,-32]\n\nFreeway 1 has three cars, freeway 2 has one, freeway 3 has one, freeway 4,5,6 have three each, freeway 7 and 8 have one each.\n\nPlayer starts at y=3 at turn t=4.\n\nI need to go to y=9, which is not a freeway, so no cars there. y=0 and y=9 are safe, I assume, since freeways are y=1 to 8.\n\nThe goal is to reach (0,9), so y=9.\n\nSince y=9 has no cars, once I'm there, no collision.\n\nNow, I need to move up from y=3 to y=9, but avoiding the cars when I'm on freeways y=1 to 8.\n\nEach action U, D, S changes y by +1, -1, 0.\n\ny must stay between 0 and 9, so I can't go below 0 or above 9.\n\nSince I start at 3 and need to go to 9, I need to increase y by 6, so minimum 6 turns if I go up every turn, but I might have to wait or detour to avoid cars.\n\nH is the number of turns from t₁, so after H turns, I am at turn t₁ + H, position y_{t₁+H}.\n\nThe sequence is for t from t₁ to t₁ + H -1, so actions at turns t₁ to t₁+H-1, and after H actions, I am at y_{t₁+H}.\n\nAnd we want y_{t₁+H} = 9.\n\nSince y starts at 3, to reach 9, I need net +6 in y changes.\n\nEach U gives +1, D gives -1, S gives 0.\n\nSo the minimal H without obstacles would be 6, with all U.\n\nBut with cars, I might need more if I have to wait or go down sometimes.\n\nFirst, I need to see for each freeway, when 0 is occupied by a car at different times.\n\nSince all cars are moving right at constant speed, I can find for each freeway, the times when a car is at x=0.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if for freeway y_T, there is a car such that 0 ∈ [τ + s(T-t₁), h + s(T-t₁)] for right-moving cars.\n\nSince all cars are right-moving, Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t₁), h + s(T-t₁)]\n\nAnd 0 is in this interval if τ + s(T-t₁) ≤ 0 ≤ h + s(T-t₁)\n\nSince for right-moving, τ ≤ h, so it's τ + sΔT ≤ 0 ≤ h + sΔT, where ΔT = T - t₁.\n\nNow, t₁ = 4, so ΔT = T - 4.\n\nLet me define t = T - t₁, so at time relative to t₁.\n\nSet τ = 0 at t₁.\n\nSo for a car, at Δt after t₁, position: left end = τ + s Δt, right end = h + s Δt\n\n0 in span if τ + s Δt ≤ 0 ≤ h + s Δt\n\nSince τ and h are at t₁.\n\nFor each car, I can find the values of Δt where this inequality holds.\n\nBut since multiple cars per freeway, I need to find when at least one car has 0 in span.\n\nFirst, let's list all freeways and their cars.\n\nFreeway 1: three cars:\n\nCar A: τ = -43, h = -32, s=4\n\nSo 0 in span if -43 + 4 Δt ≤ 0 ≤ -32 + 4 Δt\n\nSimilarly, car B: τ = -7, h = 4, s=4 → -7 + 4 Δt ≤ 0 ≤ 4 + 4 Δt\n\nCar C: τ = 29, h = 40, s=4 → 29 + 4 Δt ≤ 0 ≤ 40 + 4 Δt\n\nNow, for car C: 29 + 4Δt ≤ 0? 29 + 4Δt is at least 29 since Δt ≥0, so 29 + 4Δt ≥ 29 >0, so left end >0, so 0 ≤ left end is false, so 0 not in span for car C ever, since left end starts at 29 and increases.\n\nSimilarly, for car A: -43 + 4Δt ≤ 0 ≤ -32 + 4Δt\n\nSolve inequalities.\n\nFirst, -43 + 4Δt ≤ 0 ⇒ 4Δt ≤ 43 ⇒ Δt ≤ 43/4 = 10.75\n\nSecond, 0 ≤ -32 + 4Δt ⇒ 4Δt ≥ 32 ⇒ Δt ≥ 8\n\nSo for car A, Δt between 8 and 10.75 inclusive? Since Δt integer? Turns are discrete, so Δt integer.\n\nΔt = T - t₁, T is turn number, integer, so Δt integer.\n\nSo Δt ≥ 8 and Δt ≤ 10.75, so Δt = 8,9,10\n\nSimilarly, for car B: -7 + 4Δt ≤ 0 ≤ 4 + 4Δt\n\n-7 + 4Δt ≤ 0 ⇒ 4Δt ≤ 7 ⇒ Δt ≤ 7/4 = 1.75\n\n0 ≤ 4 + 4Δt always true since 4 + 4Δt ≥ 4 >0 for Δt ≥0\n\nSo only -7 + 4Δt ≤ 0, which is Δt ≤ 1.75, so Δt = 0,1? Δt integer, Δt ≥0.\n\nAt Δt=0: -7 +0 = -7 ≤0, 0 ≤4, true.\n\nΔt=1: -7+4= -3 ≤0, 0≤4+4=8, true.\n\nΔt=2: -7+8=1 ≤0? 1 ≤0 false, so not.\n\nSo car B: Δt=0 and 1.\n\nBut Δt=0 is t=t₁, which is turn 4.\n\nNow for freeway 1:\n\nCar A occupied at Δt=8,9,10\n\nCar B at Δt=0,1\n\nCar C never.\n\nSo freeway 1 has collision at Δt=0,1 (from car B) and Δt=8,9,10 (from car A).\n\nΔt=0: turn 4, Δt=1: turn 5, etc.\n\nNow freeway 2: one car: τ=-35, h=-24, s=12\n\n0 in span if -35 + 12 Δt ≤ 0 ≤ -24 + 12 Δt\n\nFirst, -35 +12Δt ≤0 ⇒ 12Δt ≤35 ⇒ Δt ≤ 35/12 ≈ 2.916, so Δt ≤2\n\nSecond, 0 ≤ -24 +12Δt ⇒ 12Δt ≥24 ⇒ Δt ≥2\n\nSo Δt ≥2 and Δt ≤ 2.916, so Δt=2\n\nThus, collision only at Δt=2, which is turn t=6 (since t₁=4, Δt=2, T=6)\n\nNow freeway 3: one car: τ=-43, h=-32, s=4, same as car A on freeway1.\n\nSo collision at Δt=8,9,10 → turns 12,13,14? t=t₁ + Δt, t₁=4, so Δt=8: turn 12, Δt=9: turn 13, Δt=10: turn 14.\n\nt₁=4, Δt=0: turn 4, Δt=1: turn 5, ..., Δt=8: turn 12, etc.\n\nFreeway 3: same as freeway1 car A, so occupied at Δt=8,9,10 → turns 12,13,14.\n\nBut freeway 3 is different row.\n\nNow freeway 4: three cars, same as freeway1: cars like A,B,C.\n\nCar A: [-43,-32] s=4 → occ at Δt=8,9,10\n\nCar B: [-7,4] s=4 → occ at Δt=0,1\n\nCar C: [29,40] s=4 → never\n\nSo same as freeway1: occupied at Δt=0,1 and 8,9,10\n\nSimilarly freeway 5: same as above, occupied at Δt=0,1 and 8,9,10\n\nFreeway 6: same, occupied at Δt=0,1 and 8,9,10\n\nFreeway 7: one car: τ=-43, h=-32, s=4, same as car A, so occupied at Δt=8,9,10 → turns 12,13,14\n\nFreeway 8: same as freeway7, occupied at Δt=8,9,10 → turns 12,13,14\n\nNow, player starts at turn 4, y=3.\n\nAt turn 4, y=3, which is freeway 3? Freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=3 is freeway 3.\n\nAt turn 4, Δt=0, y=3, freeway 3.\n\nIs freeway 3 occupied at Δt=0? From above, freeway 3 has only one car, occupied at Δt=8,9,10, not at Δt=0. So at turn 4, freeway 3 is safe, no car at x=0.\n\nBut player is at (0,3) at turn 4, and we need to check collision at each turn when on freeway.\n\nAt turn 4, y=3, freeway 3, cars: only one car, which is not at 0 at Δt=0, so safe.\n\nNow, I need to go to y=9.\n\ny=9 is safe, no freeway.\n\nThe path: I need to move from y=3 to y=9, so through y=4,5,6,7,8.\n\nBut I can stay or move up/down.\n\nMinimal turns: go up every turn, so actions U,U,U,U,U,U for 6 turns, to y=9.\n\nBut need to check if I collide on the way.\n\nStart at turn 4, y=3.\n\nAction at turn 4: if I do U, then y5 = y4 +1 =4\n\nOr S, stay, or D down, but down to 2, not good.\n\nI should go up.\n\nBut let's see the positions.\n\nI am at turn T, y_T.\n\nFor each turn, when I am on a freeway, I need no car at x=0 on that freeway.\n\nNow, from above, freeway 3: occupied only at Δt=8,9,10, i.e., turns 12,13,14.\n\nSince t₁=4, turn 12 is t=12, which is later.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways.\n\nFreeway 1: occupied at Δt=0,1 and 8,9,10 → turns 4,5, and 12,13,14\n\nΔt=0: turn 4, Δt=1: turn 5, Δt=8: turn 12, etc.\n\nFreeway 2: occupied only at Δt=2, turn 6.\n\nFreeway 3: occupied at Δt=8,9,10, turns 12,13,14\n\nFreeway 4: same as 1, occupied turns 4,5,12,13,14\n\nFreeway 5: same, turns 4,5,12,13,14\n\nFreeway 6: same, turns 4,5,12,13,14\n\nFreeway 7: occupied at Δt=8,9,10, turns 12,13,14\n\nFreeway 8: occupied at Δt=8,9,10, turns 12,13,14\n\nPlayer starts turn 4, y=3.\n\ny=3 is freeway 3.\n\nAt turn 4, Δt=0, freeway 3: not occupied, as above.\n\nIf I go up to y=4 at turn 5.\n\nNow, action at turn 4: suppose I do U, then at turn 5, y=4.\n\nAt turn 5, y=4, which is freeway 4.\n\nFreeway 4 at turn 5: Δt = T - t₁ = 5-4=1, so Δt=1.\n\nFreeway 4 occupied at Δt=1? From above, freeway 4 occupied at turns 4,5,12,13,14.\n\nTurn 4: Δt=0, turn 5: Δt=1, both occupied.\n\nAt turn 5, Δt=1, freeway 4 is occupied.\n\nIf I am at y=4 at turn 5, and freeway 4 has a car at x=0, so collision.\n\nTherefore, if I go directly up at turn 4 to y=4 at turn 5, I collide at turn 5.\n\nI need to avoid that.\n\nPerhaps I should not go up immediately, or go down first.\n\nBut going down might take more turns.\n\nSince the obstacles are only at early and late times, I might wait at y=3 or go down to y=0 or something.\n\ny=0 is safe, no freeway.\n\nSimilarly, y=9 safe.\n\nNow, let's list the occupied times for each freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: turns 4,5,12,13,14\n\nFreeway 2: turn 6 only\n\nFreeway 3: turns 12,13,14\n\nFreeway 4: turns 4,5,12,13,14\n\nFreeway 5: turns 4,5,12,13,14\n\nFreeway 6: turns 4,5,12,13,14\n\nFreeway 7: turns 12,13,14\n\nFreeway 8: turns 12,13,14\n\nPlayer at turn 4: y=3, freeway 3, which is safe at turn 4 (not occupied).\n\nI need to be at y=9 at some turn.\n\nIf I stay at y=3 for some turns, but freeway 3 is safe except at turns 12,13,14, which are later.\n\nSimilarly, if I go to other rows.\n\nBut I need to go through y=4,5,6,7,8 to reach y=9.\n\ny=4,5,6 are problematic at early times.\n\nSpecifically, freeway 4,5,6 are occupied at turns 4 and 5.\n\nTurn 4: freeway 4,5,6 occupied.\n\nBut at turn 4, player is at y=3, which is not occupied, so ok.\n\nIf I want to go to y=4, I need to be at y=4 at some turn.\n\nAt turn 4, y=3, if I do S, stay, then at turn 5, I am still at y=3.\n\nAt turn 5, y=3, freeway 3, which is not occupied (only at 12-14), so safe.\n\nThen at turn 5, if I do U, to y=4 at turn 6.\n\nAt turn 6, y=4, freeway 4.\n\nNow, freeway 4 at turn 6: Δt=6-4=2, which is not in occupied turns for freeway 4 (turns 4,5,12,13,14), so not occupied, safe.\n\nSimilarly, I can proceed.\n\nLet's plan a path.\n\nStart: turn 4, y=3\n\nOption 1: Go up immediately.\n\nTurn 4: U → y5=4\n\nBut at turn 5, y=4, freeway 4, which is occupied at turn 5 (since Δt=1), collision. Not good.\n\nOption 2: Stay at turn 4: S → at turn 5, y=3 (still)\n\nTurn 5, y=3, safe, as above.\n\nThen turn 5: U → y6=4\n\nAt turn 6, y=4, freeway 4, Δt=2, not occupied (freeway4 occ at 4,5,12,13,14, not 6), so safe.\n\nThen turn 6: U → y7=5\n\nAt turn 7, y=5, freeway 5.\n\nFreeway 5 occupied at turns 4,5,12,13,14. Turn 7, Δt=3, not in list, so safe.\n\nThen turn 7: U → y8=6\n\nAt turn 8, y=6, freeway 6.\n\nFreeway 6 occupied at turns 4,5,12,13,14. Turn 8, Δt=4, not in list, safe.\n\nThen turn 8: U → y9=7\n\nAt turn 9, y=7, freeway 7.\n\nFreeway 7 occupied at turns 12,13,14. Turn 9, Δt=5, not 12-14, so safe.\n\nThen turn 9: U → y10=8\n\nAt turn 10, y=8, freeway 8.\n\nFreeway 8 occupied at turns 12,13,14. Turn 10, Δt=6, not 12-14, safe.\n\nThen turn 10: U → y11=9\n\nAt turn 11, y=9, not a freeway, safe. Reached.\n\nNow, H: from turn 4 to turn 11, that's 7 actions? Turns: actions at turn 4,5,6,7,8,9,10 to reach y11=9.\n\nNumber of turns: from t=4 to t=10 inclusive? Actions at t=4 to t=10, 7 actions, to be at y11.\n\nSequence: turn4: S (stay), turn5: U, turn6: U, turn7: U, turn8: U, turn9: U, turn10: U\n\nAfter these, y11=9.\n\nBut at turn4, I did S, so y4=3, then turn5: U to y5=4? No.\n\nAt turn T, after action, y_{T+1} is set.\n\nStart: turn4, position y4=3.\n\nAction a4: if S, then y5 = y4 +0 =3\n\nThen at turn5, position y5=3.\n\nAction a5: U, then y6 = y5 +1 =4\n\nThen at turn6, y6=4\n\nAction a6: U, y7=5\n\nAt turn7, y7=5\n\nAction a7: U, y8=6\n\nAt turn8, y8=6\n\nAction a8: U, y9=7\n\nAt turn9, y9=7\n\nAction a9: U, y10=8\n\nAt turn10, y10=8\n\nAction a10: U, y11=9\n\nAt turn11, y11=9, done.\n\nH=7 turns? Actions from t=4 to t=10, that's 7 actions.\n\nBut is this minimal? Earlier I thought min 6, but with obstacles, I had to wait one turn.\n\nIn this case, I used one S at start, then all U.\n\nBut I could go directly if I avoid the occupied times.\n\nFor example, at turn 4, y=3, instead of staying, can I go down? But y=2 is freeway 2.\n\nFreeway 2 occupied only at turn 6.\n\nIf I go down at turn 4: D, then y5=2\n\nAt turn5, y=2, freeway 2.\n\nFreeway 2 at turn5: Δt=1, occupied only at Δt=2, turn6, not turn5, so safe.\n\nThen at turn5, I can go up to y=3 or to y=1, etc., but I need to go up eventually.\n\nThis might take more turns.\n\nFor example, turn4: D → y5=2\n\nTurn5: U → y6=3\n\nBut y6=3 at turn6, freeway3, which is safe except later, turn6 Δt=2, not occupied, safe.\n\nBut now at y=3, same as start, and I have used two turns to go down and up, net no progress, worse than staying.\n\nTurn4: D → y5=2\n\nTurn5: U → y6=3? y6 = y5 +1 =2+1=3, yes.\n\nBut I was at y=3 at turn4, now at y=3 at turn6, wasted two turns.\n\nNot good.\n\nFrom y=2, go directly to y=4? But to go to y=4, I need to be at y=4 at some turn.\n\nAt turn5, y=2, I can do U to y=3 at turn6, or D to y=1, etc.\n\nBut let's not digress; the first plan with one wait seems better.\n\nIn the first plan, H=7 actions to reach in 7 turns from start? From turn4 to turn10 actions, reach at turn11.\n\nSince we start at turn4, after H actions, at turn t1+H.\n\nt1=4, after H actions, at turn 4+H.\n\nWe want y_{4+H} =9.\n\nIn the sequence, actions at t=4 to 4+H-1, y from 3 to 9.\n\nIn my sequence: action at t=4: S, y5=3\n\nt=5: U, y6=4\n\nt=6: U, y7=5\n\nt=7: U, y8=6\n\nt=8: U, y9=7\n\nt=9: U, y10=8\n\nt=10: U, y11=9\n\nSo y11=9, so 4+H=11, H=7.\n\nBut is there a way with H=6?\n\nH=6 means actions from t=4 to t=9, reach y10=9.\n\ny10=9.\n\nStart y4=3.\n\nAfter 6 actions, y_{10} should be 9.\n\nNet Δy = +6, so I need exactly six U actions, no S or D, because S or D would require more U or not reach +6.\n\nIf I do S or D, I need to compensate with extra U, so more actions.\n\nTo have net +6 in 6 actions, I must do U every time, no S or D.\n\nSo only possibility: all U from turn4 to turn9.\n\nThen positions:\n\nTurn4: y4=3\n\na4=U → y5=4\n\nAt turn5: position y5=4, freeway4, occupied at turn5 (since freeway4 occ at turn5), collision! Not possible.\n\nIf I start later, but I have to start at turn4.\n\nPerhaps go down first, but with all U, I can only go up.\n\nUnless I do different actions, but with H=6, must all be U to reach y=9 from y=3 in 6 steps.\n\ny_{t} at t=4 is 3, y_{10} =9, so from y4 to y10, 6 steps: y5 to y10.\n\ny5 = y4 + Δy4\n\ny6 = y5 + Δy5 = y4 + Δy4 + Δy5\n\n...\n\ny10 = y4 + sum_{t=4 to 9} Δy_t\n\nSet y10=9, y4=3, so sum_{t=4 to 9} Δy_t = 6\n\nEach Δy_t = +1, -1, or 0, so to sum to 6 in 6 terms, all must be +1, so all a_t = U for t=4 to 9.\n\nThus, y5=4, y6=5, y7=6, y8=7, y9=8, y10=9.\n\nNow, check collisions:\n\nAt turn5: y5=4, freeway4, occupied at turn5, collision.\n\nSimilarly, at turn6: y6=5, freeway5, which is occupied at turn6? Freeway5 occupied at turns 4,5,12,13,14. Turn6 not occupied, but at turn5, y5=4, which is occupied.\n\nOnly turn5 has issue, but since collision at turn5, it fails.\n\nThus, impossible with H=6.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 7, as I had.\n\nBut in my sequence, I have H=7 with one S and six U.\n\nBut I could have other sequences.\n\nFor example, instead of staying at turn4, I could go up later or something.\n\nBut in this case, with H=7, it works.\n\nNow, in the sequence, at turn4 I did S, but is there a way to go up immediately without colliding?\n\nAt turn4, y=3, if I do U, y5=4, but at turn5 y=4 occupied.\n\nUnless I go to a different row.\n\nBut from y=3, I can only go to y=4,2, or stay.\n\ny=2 at turn5.\n\nIf at turn4, I do U to y5=4, but collision, not possible.\n\nDo D to y5=2.\n\nThen at turn5, y=2, freeway2.\n\nFreeway2 at turn5: Δt=1, occupied only at turn6, not turn5, so safe.\n\nThen I need to get to y=9.\n\nFrom y=2 at turn5.\n\nNow, if I go all U, y6=3, y7=4, etc., but at turn6, y=3, freeway3, safe.\n\nTurn7: y=4, freeway4.\n\nTurn7: Δt=3, freeway4 not occupied (only 4,5,12-14), safe.\n\nTurn8: y=5, freeway5, Δt=4, not occupied.\n\nTurn9: y=6, freeway6, Δt=5, not occupied.\n\nTurn10: y=7, freeway7, Δt=6, not occupied (freeway7 occ at 12-14)\n\nTurn11: y=8, freeway8, Δt=7, not occupied.\n\nTurn12: y=9, safe.\n\nBut this takes more turns: from turn4: D to y5=2\n\nTurn5: U to y6=3\n\nTurn6: U to y7=4\n\nTurn7: U to y8=5\n\nTurn8: U to y9=6\n\nTurn9: U to y10=7\n\nTurn10: U to y11=8\n\nTurn11: U to y12=9\n\nNow y12=9, so after actions at t=4 to t=11, that's 8 actions, H=8, worse than before.\n\nAfter turn11 action, y12=9.\n\nActions from t=4 to t=11, 8 actions.\n\nBut in first plan, only 7 actions.\n\nSo better to stay at y=3 for one turn than go down.\n\nPerhaps from y=2, I can go directly to higher, but I can only move one step per turn.\n\nAnother idea: at some point, I might need to avoid the late obstacles, but in this case, for H=7, I reach before the late times.\n\nIn my first plan, I reach y=9 at turn11, and the late obstacles are at turns 12-14, so no issue.\n\nIn the sequence, when I go through freeways, I am at y=4 at turn6, which is before turn12, safe.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nBut let me confirm freeway 2.\n\nIn my first plan, I didn't go to y=2, so freeway 2 is not an issue.\n\nNow, in the sequence, I have turn4: S, so y5=3\n\nTurn5: U, y6=4\n\nAt turn6, y=4, freeway4, Δt=2, not occupied, ok.\n\nThen up to y=8 at turn10, then U to y11=9.\n\nAt turn10, y=8, freeway8, which is occupied at turns12,13,14, turn10 is Δt=6, not those, so safe.\n\nIs there any other car? For example, freeway 2 has a car at turn6, but I am not on freeway 2 at turn6; at turn6 I am on y=4, freeway4.\n\nSo no.\n\nTherefore, the sequence works with H=7.\n\nBut can I do it in H=7 without the initial stay?\n\nFor example, start by going up at a different time.\n\nAt turn4, y=3, if I do nothing, but I have to take action.\n\nSuppose I go up at turn4 to y=4, but collision at turn5.\n\nNot possible.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=1 or something, but might take more time.\n\nAnother thought: at turn4, I could go down to y=2, but as before, takes more time.\n\nPerhaps I can move faster in some way, but I can only change by one per turn.\n\nUnless I skip some rows, but I have to go through each y.\n\nFor example, to go from y=3 to y=9, I need to be on each intermediate row at some turn, but I can be on a row multiple times, but that would increase turns.\n\nMinimal is to go directly with possible waits.\n\nIn this case, with one wait at start.\n\nI could wait later.\n\nFor example, at turn4: U to y5=4, but collision, not possible.\n\nTurn4: S to y5=3\n\nThen as before.\n\nAfter reaching y=4, I might need to wait, but in the path, no need.\n\nSuppose I go up to y=6 quickly.\n\nBut from y=3, if I go U at turn4 to y5=4, collision.\n\nCannot.\n\nUnless I go to y=2 first.\n\nTurn4: D to y5=2\n\nThen at turn5, y=2, freeway2, which at turn5 is not occupied (only turn6), so safe.\n\nThen turn5: U to y6=3\n\nTurn6: U to y7=4\n\nNow at turn7, y=4, freeway4, Δt=3, not occupied, safe.\n\nThen continue U: turn7: U to y8=5\n\nturn8: U to y9=6\n\nturn9: U to y10=7\n\nturn10: U to y11=8\n\nturn11: U to y12=9\n\nBut now y12=9, with actions from t=4 to t=11, H=8, worse.\n\nFrom y=2, at turn5, I could go U twice or something, but still, to y=3 then y=4.\n\nNo shortcut.\n\nThus, minimal H is 7, with sequence: S at turn4, then U each turn until turn10.\n\nIn the sequence: actions at t=4: S, t=5: U, t=6: U, t=7: U, t=8: U, t=9: U, t=10: U\n\nThen y11=9.\n\nNow, in the answer, I need to output the actions starting from turn t1=4.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 4: S\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nBut after turn10 action, y11=9, so H=7 actions.\n\nNow, but in the sequence, at turn10, I do U to y11=9.\n\nIs there a way to reach earlier? With H=6 impossible, as we saw.\n\nPerhaps I can reach y=9 at turn10 with H=6, but from above, not possible.\n\ny10=9 requires net +6 from y4=3 in 6 steps (t=4 to9), must all U, but then y5=4 at turn5 collides.\n\nSo no.\n\nThus, H=7 is minimal.\n\nNow, in the sequence, I have S at turn4.\n\nBut let me confirm if at turn5, when I am at y=3, is it safe? Yes.\n\nAnd at turn6, y=4, freeway4, Δt=2, not occupied.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nBut freeway 4 has cars at turn4 and turn5, but at turn6, not.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nAnother thing: freeway 2 is occupied at turn6, but I am not on it at that time.\n\nIn my sequence, at turn6, I am at y=4, not y=2.\n\nSo fine.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 7, with actions as above.\n\nNow, for the output, I need to write the actions.\n\nBut the player starts at turn t1=4, position (0,3).\n\nIn the sequence, turn4: action S, so stay at y=3.\n\nThen turn5: U to y=4.\n\nEtc.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 4: S\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\n}\n\nBut H=7, and the last action is at turn10.\n\nTo confirm, after turn10 action, y11=9.\n\nThe sequence is for t from t1 to t1+H-1, so t=4 to 4+6=10? H=7, t1=4, so actions from t=4 to t=4+H-1=4+6=10.\n\nt=4 to t=10 inclusive.\n\nAnd y_{t1 + H} = y_{4+7} = y11=9.\n\nYes.\n\nPerhaps I can have a sequence with no S, but with D, but that would require extra U, so H larger, not better.\n\nThus, this should be minimal.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's see if I can start with U at a different point.\n\nSuppose at turn4, I do S, as before.\n\nIf I do nothing, same.\n\nPerhaps I can go up later but still H=7.\n\nFor example, turn4: U? But cannot, collision.\n\nTurn4: S, turn5: S, but then I stay longer, H larger.\n\nNot better.\n\nTurn4: U to y5=4, but collision, invalid.\n\nSo no other choice.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is as above.\n\nNow, in the output, it should be in the box.\n\nBut let me write the actions clearly.\n\nSo for turn t1=4:\n\nAction a4 = S\n\nThen a5 = U\n\na6 = U\n\na7 = U\n\na8 = U\n\na9 = U\n\na10 = U\n\nAnd that's it.\n\nNow, to write in the format.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 3) at turn \\(t_1 = 4\\). The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\).\n\n### Analysis:\n- The player must increase their y-position from 3 to 9, requiring a net change of +6.\n- Without obstacles, the minimal \\(H\\) is 6, achieved by moving up (U) every turn. However, due to car positions, moving up immediately causes a collision at turn 5 on freeway 4.\n- Freeway occupancy analysis (based on car movements and collision conditions) shows:\n  - Freeway 4 is occupied at turns 4 and 5 (relative to \\(t_1 = 4\\)).\n  - Other freeways have occupancy at later turns (e.g., turns 12-14), which do not affect a minimal-time path.\n- A sequence with \\(H = 6\\) (all U actions) results in a collision at turn 5 (y=4, freeway 4 occupied). Thus, \\(H = 6\\) is impossible.\n- A sequence with \\(H = 7\\) is possible by staying (S) at turn 4 to avoid the collision at turn 5, then moving up (U) for the next 6 turns. This reaches y=9 at turn 11 without collisions:\n  - Turn 4: S → y=3 (freeway 3, safe at turn 4).\n  - Turn 5: U → y=4 (freeway 4, safe at turn 6, as freeway 4 is not occupied at Δt=2).\n  - Turn 6: U → y=5 (freeway 5, safe at turn 7, Δt=3 not occupied).\n  - Turn 7: U → y=6 (freeway 6, safe at turn 8, Δt=4 not occupied).\n  - Turn 8: U → y=7 (freeway 7, safe at turn 9, Δt=5 not occupied).\n  - Turn 9: U → y=8 (freeway 8, safe at turn 10, Δt=6 not occupied).\n  - Turn 10: U → y=9 (safe, not a freeway).\n- \\(H = 7\\) is minimal, as \\(H = 6\\) is infeasible and no shorter path exists.\n\n### Sequence of Actions:\nThe sequence of actions for turns \\(t_1 = 4\\) to \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 10\\) is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 4: S\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\n}",

We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on the freeways (y=1 to 8) at the moment we are on that freeway.\n\nImportant note: \n- Collision occurs at turn T only if at that turn the player is on a freeway k (i.e., y_T = k) and 0 (the x-coordinate of the player) is in the span of any car on that freeway at the same turn T.\n- When moving from y_T to y_{T+1} (by U or D), note that at turn T the player is still on y_T and will move to y_{T+1} at the next turn. So at turn T, we only check the freeway y_T.\n\nThe car update:\n  For a car on freeway i at turn t1 (current turn) with head h, tail tau, direction d, speed s:\n    If left-moving (d = left): \n        Span(T) = [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\n    If right-moving (d = right):\n        Span(T) = [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut note: in the given state, all cars are right-moving (d = right). So for each car, at turn T (>= t1), the span is:\n   [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nWe are at turn t1=5. We will simulate the player's moves and check at each turn which freeway we are on and whether the car spans on that freeway at that turn cover 0.\n\nGoal: reach (0,9) as quickly as possible.\n\nSince we start at y=3 and need to get to y=9, we must move upward. The minimal number of moves without any obstacles would be 6 moves (all U). However, we have to avoid collisions on freeways 4,5,6,7,8 (and also 3 if we stay there) as we move up.\n\nWe are allowed to move down, but that would take more turns, so we should avoid that unless necessary.\n\nWe can also stay (S) to wait for a car to pass.\n\nWe need to compute the positions of the cars at future turns.\n\nLet me denote the current turn as T0 = 5.\n\nFor a future turn T (>=5), the position of a car that is given at T0=5 with (h, tau, d, s) is:\n   Since d=right: \n        left_end = tau + s*(T-5)\n        right_end = h + s*(T-5)\n\nAnd the span is [left_end, right_end] (because tau is the tail and h is the head? But note: in the table for a right-moving car, they wrote: (head h, tail tau) and then the span at T0 is [tau, h]? Actually, they wrote: \n   Right-moving: Span(t1) = [tau, h] -> becomes [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut note: in the given data, for example on freeway 1: \n   (-28, -39, right, 4) -> at T0=5: span = [-39, -28]? That doesn't make sense because -39 is less than -28. But they say: \"head h, tail tau\", and for a right-moving car, the head is at the right? So the tail is at -39 and head at -28? Then the span is from -39 to -28? But then at T0=5, the car is from -39 to -28? \n\nWait, they wrote: \n   For right-moving: [Span(t1) = [tau, h]] -> meaning that at t1, the car's tail is at tau and head at h? But then the span is [tau, h] and since tau < h, that would be the interval. However, in the example: (-28, -39, ...) -> if h = -28 and tau = -39, then tau < h? Actually, -39 < -28, so the car spans from -39 to -28? That is a car of length 11? \n\nBut then the update: at T, the car moves right, so the entire segment shifts right by s*(T-t1). So at T, the span is [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n\nSimilarly, for the car (8, -3, right, 4) on freeway 1: at T0=5, the car is from -3 to 8? That is a car of length 11? And then (44,33,right,4) -> that would be from 33 to 44? But 33 to 44 is 11 as well.\n\nBut wait: (44,33) -> then head=44, tail=33? Then the span is [33,44]. But the direction is right, so moving to the right.\n\nNow, the collision condition: at turn T, if the player is on freeway k and the player's x=0 is in the span of any car on freeway k at turn T.\n\nSo we must avoid having 0 in [tau + s*(T-5), h + s*(T-5)] for any car on the freeway k that we are on at turn T.\n\nWe are going to simulate the player's moves. We start at turn5 at y=3.\n\nWe need to output the actions for turns 5, 6, 7, ... until we reach 9.\n\nWe are to minimize H (the number of turns including the starting turn? Actually, the sequence is from t=0 to H-1, meaning H moves? But note: we are at turn5 (the starting state). Then we take an action at turn5 to move to turn6, then turn7, etc. until we are at 9 at some turn.\n\nWe start at turn5 at y=3. Then at turn5 we choose an action (U, D, or S) which will determine y6. Then at turn6 we are at y6, and so on.\n\nWe are done when we are at y=9 at some turn T, and then H = T - 5 + 1? Actually, the sequence is from t=0 to H-1, meaning we take H actions? And we start at turn5 and take actions at turn5, turn5+1, ... turn5+H-1, and then after H actions, we are at turn5+H. But the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning t=0 corresponds to a_{t1}, and t=H-1 corresponds to a_{t1+H-1}. Then at turn t1+H we have the position? Actually, the update: after action a_{t} we get y_{t+1}. So:\n\n  At turn5: we are at y5=3.\n  We choose a5: then we get y6 = y5 + Delta y5.\n  Then at turn6: we are at y6, then choose a6, etc.\n\nWe want to reach y_{t1+H} = 9? But note: the sequence of actions is from t=0 to H-1, so we take H actions, and then at turn5+H we are at y_{5+H}. So we require y_{5+H}=9.\n\nBut the problem says: \"reach (0,9)\" at turn t1+H-1? Let me check: \n  \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and then \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\". \n\nWait: \n  The sequence is for t=0 to H-1: \n      a_{t1+0} = a_{t1} (turn5)\n      a_{t1+1} = a_{6}\n      ...\n      a_{t1+H-1} = a_{5+H-1}\n\nThen after the last action (a_{5+H-1}), we are at turn t1+H = 5+H. But the problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\" meaning at the turn after the last action? \n\nActually, the update rule: \n   At turn t, we are at y_t, then we choose a_t, and then we get y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t.\n\nSo at the turn when we take the last action (a_{5+H-1}), we are at y_{5+H-1}. Then after the action, we get y_{5+H} = y_{5+H-1} + Delta. But the goal is to have y_{5+H-1} = 9? \n\nWait, the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\". So at the turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9). \n\nBut note: at turn t1+H-1, we are about to take an action? Then after that action we would leave? But the goal is to be at (0,9) at that turn. And we don't require to take an action after that? \n\nSo the last turn we are at (0,9) is turn5+H-1. Therefore, we start at turn5 (at y=3) and we want to be at y=9 at turn5+H-1. \n\nSo the number of turns we are simulating is H-1? Actually, we are taking H actions? But note the sequence has H actions: from t=0 to H-1 (which are at turns 5, 6, ..., 5+H-1). Then at the moment after the last action (at turn5+H-1) we have y_{5+H}? But the goal is at turn5+H-1 we must be at 9.\n\nWait, let me clarify:\n\nAt turn5 (t1=5): we start at y5=3. Then we take an action a5. Then at turn6, we are at y6 = y5 + Delta(a5). Then we take a6, ... until we take an action at turn5+H-1? Then at turn5+H-1 we are at y_{5+H-1}. We require that y_{5+H-1} = 9.\n\nBut note: at turn5+H-1, we take an action a_{5+H-1} and then we get y_{5+H}. But we don't care about y_{5+H} because we are only required to be at 9 at turn5+H-1.\n\nSo we are at turn5+H-1 at position (0,9). And we have taken H actions: at turns 5, 6, ..., 5+H-1. So H is the number of actions.\n\nWe are to minimize H.\n\nWe start at turn5 at y=3. We need to get to y=9. The minimal H without obstacles would be 6: because 3 to 9 is 6 steps, so we need 6 actions? But wait: \n  Start at turn5: y5=3.\n  After action a5 (U): turn6, y6=4.\n  After a6 (U): turn7, y7=5.\n  ... until at turn10: y10=8? Then at turn11: y11=9? That would be 6 actions (from turn5 to turn10) and then at turn10 we are at 9? But then H=6? But then we are at y10=9, which is at turn5+5? Wait: \n      t1+H-1 = 5 + H - 1 = 10 -> then H=6? So 6 actions: \n          turn5: a5\n          turn6: a6\n          ...\n          turn10: a10\n\nBut we require at turn10 (which is t1+5) to be at 9. So we need to go from 3 to 9 in 5 moves? That would require 6 moves? \n\nWait: 3 to 4: one move, 4 to 5: second, 5 to 6: third, 6 to 7: fourth, 7 to 8: fifth, 8 to 9: sixth. So we need 6 moves. Then at turn5+6 = turn11 we would be at 9? But that does not match: we require at turn5+H-1=11 to be at 9? Then H-1=6, so H=7? \n\nI think I have an off-by-one. Let me reexamine:\n\nWe have:\n  Turn t1 (5): we are at y5=3. We take action a5 -> then at turn6, we are at y6.\n  Turn6: we take a6 -> at turn7, y7.\n  ...\n  We take an action at turn t1 + (H-1) = 5+H-1 -> then at turn 5+H, we are at y_{5+H}.\n\nBut the problem says: we must have y_{t1+H-1} = 9. So we require that at turn 5+H-1, we are at 9.\n\nBut after we take an action at turn5+H-1, we get y_{5+H}. So how can we be at 9 at turn5+H-1? \n\nActually, the state at turn5+H-1 is the state BEFORE we take the action at that turn? Or after? \n\nThe problem says: \"the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions ... to reach (0,9)\".\n\nAnd the answer format: \n  Turn t1: a_{t1}\n  Turn t1+1: a_{t1+1}\n  ...\n  Turn t1+H-1: a_{t1+H-1}\n\nSo we take H actions: at turns t1, t1+1, ... t1+H-1.\n\nAfter taking the action at turn t1+H-1, we get the next state at turn t1+H. But the goal is to be at (0,9) at the turn when we have taken the last action? Actually, the goal is to be at (0,9) at the turn when we are about to take an action? Or after? \n\nThe problem says: \"reach (0,9)\" at turn t1+H-1. So at turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9). And then we take the action a_{t1+H-1}? But then we might leave? \n\nBut note: the collision condition is checked at the turn when we are on a freeway. So if we are at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1, then we are on freeway 9? But freeways are from 1 to 8. So freeway 9 does not exist? Actually, the grid has y=0,1,...,9. And the freeways (with cars) are at y=1 to 8. So y=0 and y=9 are safe? \n\nBut the problem says: avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1,...,8. So if we are at y=0 or y=9, we are safe? \n\nSo at turn t1+H-1, we are at y=9 -> safe.\n\nBut how do we get there? \n\nWe start at turn5 at y=3. Then we take actions. We must be at y=9 at turn5+H-1.\n\nSo we need to move from 3 to 9 in (5+H-1) - 5 = H-1 turns? Actually, the moves:\n\n  We start at turn5: y5=3.\n  Then at turn6: y6 = 3 + Delta(a5)\n  ...\n  At turn5+H-1: y_{5+H-1} = 3 + sum_{t=5}^{5+H-2} Delta(a_t) = 9.\n\nSo the net upward movement must be 6. Each U gives +1, D gives -1, S gives 0. So we need the total upward moves minus downward moves to be 6. And the minimal H is at least 6 (if we do 6 U's).\n\nBut the time when we are at each freeway matters because of the cars.\n\nWe need to check for each freeway we step on (from y=3 to y=9) at the turn we are on that freeway, that 0 is not in the span of any car on that freeway at that turn.\n\nWe will plan a path: we can do a BFS over (turn, y) to find the minimal H such that at turn5+H-1 we are at y=9, and we never collide on freeways 1..8.\n\nBut note: the turn index can be large? The cars move at constant speed, so we can compute the car positions at any turn.\n\nHowever, we want minimal H. We start at turn5 at y=3. We can only change by at most 1 per turn. So to get to 9, we need at least 6 moves. So H>=6? But then the turn at which we are at y=9 would be turn5+ (H-1) = 5+H-1. For H=6, that would be turn10? Then we are at y=9 at turn10? How? \n\nActually, the moves:\n\n  At turn5: we are at y=3.\n  We take an action at turn5 -> then at turn6 we are at y=?\n  ...\n  We take an action at turn10 (which is t1+5) -> then at turn11 we are at y=?\n\nBut we require at turn10 (t1+5) to be at y=9? So we must have reached y=9 at the beginning of turn10? \n\nBut the update: we are at y_t at the beginning of turn t? Then we choose an action and then we are at y_{t+1} at the next turn.\n\nSo at the beginning of turn5: y5=3.\nAt the beginning of turn6: y6 = 3 + Delta(a5)\n...\nAt the beginning of turn5+H-1: y_{5+H-1} = ... \n\nWe require that at the beginning of turn5+H-1, we are at 9? But then we take an action at turn5+H-1? We don't care what happens after? \n\nBut note: we must not collide at any turn from 5 to 5+H-2? Because at turn5, we are at y=3 (freeway 3) and we check for collisions? Then at turn6, we are at y6, etc., until at turn5+H-1 we are at y=9 (safe). \n\nSo we must not collide at any turn t in [5, 5+H-2] (because at turn5+H-1 we are at y=9, which is safe). \n\nTherefore, we must check for each turn from 5 to 5+H-2 (if H>=1) the freeway we are on at that turn.\n\nWe start at turn5 at y=3 -> must check freeway3 at turn5.\n\nThen we move to y6 at turn6 -> check freeway y6 at turn6, etc.\n\nWe are going to try to find the minimal H such that we can have a sequence of H-1 moves (if we consider the state at turn5 as given) that get us from 3 to 9 in H-1 moves? Actually, the number of actions is H, and the number of state transitions is H? But the states we are in are at turns 5,6,...,5+H-1.\n\nWe need to be at y=9 at state 5+H-1.\n\nSo we can do a BFS in the state space: (turn, y) \n\nThe state: at a given turn t (>=5) and y in [0,9]. We start at (5,3). We want to reach (t,9) for some t. We are to minimize the number of actions? But the number of actions is (t - 5) because we take one action per turn from 5 to t-1? Then at turn t we are at 9 without having taken an action at turn t? But we don't take an action at turn t? \n\nActually, we take actions at turns 5,6,...,t-1 to get to turn t at y=9. Then the number of actions is (t-5). And we require that at each turn s (from 5 to t-1) we are safe (if y_s is between 1 and 8, then no car on freeway y_s at turn s has 0 in its span).\n\nBut note: at turn t, we are at y_t=9 (safe) and we don't take an action? So we don't need to check for collision at turn t? Actually, we are not on a freeway (because freeways are 1-8) at turn t? So we are safe.\n\nTherefore, we need to minimize H = number of actions = t - 5. And then the turn at which we are at 9 is t = 5 + H.\n\nBut the problem says: we must be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1. So 5+H-1 = t? Then H = t - 4. \n\nThis is confusing. Let me read the problem again:\n\n  \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning:\n      a_{t1+0} = a_5\n      a_{t1+1} = a_6\n      ...\n      a_{t1+H-1} = a_{5+H-1}\n\n  and then the position at turn t1+H-1 is 9? \n\nBut the position at turn t1+H-1 is the state at the beginning of that turn? Or after the action of that turn? \n\nGiven the update: \n   y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta(a_t)\n\nSo the action a_t is taken at turn t, and then the next state is y_{t+1}.\n\nTherefore, the state at the beginning of turn t is y_t.\n\nAfter we take a_{5+H-1} at turn5+H-1, we get y_{5+H} = y_{5+H-1} + Delta(a_{5+H-1}).\n\nBut we require y_{5+H-1} = 9. So at the beginning of turn5+H-1, we are at 9. Then we take an action? But we don't care about the next state? \n\nAnd then we stop? So the last action is taken at turn5+H-1? \n\nBut then we have taken H actions: from turn5 to turn5+H-1.\n\nAnd the state at the beginning of each turn t (for t=5 to 5+H-1) must be safe (if y_t in [1,8], then no car on freeway y_t at turn t has 0 in its span).\n\nAt the beginning of turn5+H-1, we are at 9 -> safe.\n\nSo we need to be at y=9 at the beginning of turn5+H-1.\n\nHow many moves? We start at turn5 at y=3. We need to get to y=9 at the beginning of turn5+H-1. The number of state transitions is (5+H-1) - 5 = H-1? \n\nBut the state changes by the actions taken from turn5 to turn5+H-2? \n\nActually, the actions we take are at turns 5,6,...,5+H-1? But then the last action (at turn5+H-1) is taken when we are already at 9? And then we move to y_{5+H} = 9 + Delta(a_{5+H-1})? But we don't care? \n\nBut wait, the requirement is only to be at 9 at the beginning of turn5+H-1. Then we can choose any action at that turn? However, the problem says \"reach (0,9)\" and then we output the actions including the last one? \n\nBut note: the goal is to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1, meaning at the beginning of that turn. Then we take an action? But the action might move us away? However, the problem does not require us to stay there. It only requires that at that turn we are there.\n\nAnd then we stop? So the last action is at the turn when we are already at 9? But that action might be anything? \n\nBut that seems wasteful. We might be able to get to 9 earlier.\n\nAlternatively, we could have been at 9 at an earlier turn. We want to minimize H, the number of actions. \n\nWe start at turn5 at y=3. We want to be at y=9 at the beginning of turn5+H-1. \n\nThe minimal H is when we move up as fast as possible: 6 steps. Then we would be at 9 at the beginning of turn5+6 = turn11? How? \n\n  At turn5: y5=3.\n  Action a5=U: then at turn6, y6=4.\n  a6=U: turn7, y7=5.\n  a7=U: turn8, y8=6.\n  a8=U: turn9, y9=7.\n  a9=U: turn10, y10=8.\n  a10=U: turn11, y11=9.\n\nBut then at the beginning of turn11, we are at 9. So we require turn5+H-1 = 11 -> 5+H-1=11 -> H=7.\n\nAnd we have taken 7 actions: at turns5,6,7,8,9,10,11? But wait, we only need to take actions until turn10 to get to 9 at turn11? \n\nBut the last action is at turn10: a10=U, which moves us from 8 to 9 at turn11. Then at the beginning of turn11, we are at 9. \n\nSo we have taken actions at turns5,6,7,8,9,10 -> 6 actions? Then H=6? \n\nBut then the turn at which we are at 9 is turn11 = 5+6 = 5+H? But the problem says we must be at 9 at turn5+H-1. Then 5+H-1=11 -> H=7. \n\nSo we must output 7 actions? But we only took 6 actions. \n\nThe issue: the sequence of actions is for turns5 to 5+H-1. And we want to be at 9 at the beginning of turn5+H-1. \n\nIn the above scenario, if we take 6 actions (turns5 to 10), then we are at 9 at turn11. But turn11 is 5+6 = 5+H (if H=6) -> then 5+H-1 = 10, and at the beginning of turn10 we were at 8, not 9.\n\nSo to be at 9 at the beginning of turn10, we would need to have been at 9 at turn10. How? \n\n  We start at turn5: 3.\n  We want to be at 9 at turn10 (which is 5+H-1 -> 5+H-1=10 -> H=6).\n\n  Then we have 5 moves: from turn5 to turn9 we take actions, and then at turn10 we are at 9.\n\n  So we need to get from 3 to 9 in 5 moves? That means net +6 in 5 moves? That requires moving up by 6 in 5 moves: which is impossible because each move at most +1.\n\nSo the minimal H is 7? Then we are at 9 at turn11 (5+7-1=11) and we have taken 7 actions.\n\nBut then we must output 7 actions. And the last action (at turn11) is taken when we are at 9? But then we move to 10? But we don't care. \n\nAlternatively, we could have been at 9 earlier? But we are constrained by the cars.\n\nBut mathematically, we cannot be at 9 in less than 6 moves? But then we must be at 9 at turn5+6 = turn11? And then H=7? \n\nSo H=7 is the minimal? \n\nBut let me confirm: \n  We need to go from 3 to 9: 6 steps. \n  We take an action at turn5 to move to 4 at turn6.\n  ... \n  At turn10: we are at 8? Then we take an action at turn10 to move to 9 at turn11.\n  Then at the beginning of turn11, we are at 9.\n\n  So we have taken actions at turns5,6,7,8,9,10 -> 6 actions. But then H=6? \n  But then we are at 9 at turn11, which is t1+6 = 5+6 = 11, but we require to be at 9 at turn t1+H-1 = 5+6-1 = 10? That is not satisfied.\n\n  If we take H=7, then we require to be at 9 at turn5+7-1 = 11. That matches.\n\n  And we take 7 actions: at turns5,6,7,8,9,10,11. \n\n  But at turn11, we are already at 9 (at the beginning of turn11), so we take an action? But then we move to 10 or 8 or stay? But we don't care. \n\n  So the minimal H is 7? \n\n  However, we could be at 9 earlier if we move faster? But we can only move one step per turn. \n\n  Or if we start at turn5 at 3, and we move up 6 times, then at turn11 we are at 9. And we must output 7 actions? But the seventh action is at turn11, and we are already at 9 at the beginning of turn11, so we can choose any action? But then we would move away? \n\n  The problem only requires to be at (0,9) at turn11. After that, we can do whatever.\n\n  But we must output exactly H=7 actions.\n\n  So the minimal H is 7.\n\nBut is it possible to be at 9 earlier by moving faster? No.\n\nTherefore, we are going to try to find a sequence of 7 actions that gets us to y=9 at the beginning of turn11 (5+7-1=11), and along the way (turns5 to 10) we avoid collisions.\n\nWe will simulate the car positions at turns 5,6,7,8,9,10.\n\nFirst, let's list the cars per freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: \n  car1: (h=-28, tau=-39, right, 4)\n  car2: (h=8, tau=-3, right, 4)\n  car3: (h=44, tau=33, right, 4)\n\nFreeway 2:\n  car: (h=-12, tau=-23, right, 12)\n\nFreeway 3:\n  car: (h=-28, tau=-39, right, 4)\n\nFreeway 4:\n  same as freeway1: three cars: (-28,-39,right,4), (8,-3,right,4), (44,33,right,4)\n\nFreeway 5: same\n\nFreeway 6: same\n\nFreeway 7: one car: (-28,-39,right,4)\n\nFreeway 8: one car: (-28,-39,right,4)\n\nWe are going to simulate the positions of these cars at turns 5,6,7,8,9,10.\n\nFor a car with (h, tau, right, s) at turn T (>=5):\n   left_end = tau + s*(T-5)\n   right_end = h + s*(T-5)\n\nWe need to check for each freeway k we are on at turn T, if 0 is in any car's span on freeway k at turn T.\n\nWe start at turn5 at y=3. We must avoid collision at freeway3 at turn5.\n\nLet's compute for freeway3 at turn5: \n   Only one car: h=-28, tau=-39, s=4.\n   T=5: left_end = -39 + 4*(0) = -39\n          right_end = -28 + 0 = -28\n   Span: [-39, -28] -> 0 is not in this interval? -> safe.\n\nAt turn5: we are safe at y=3.\n\nNow, we plan to move up as much as possible. But we must check the next freeways.\n\nWe are going to consider the path: we start at y=3 at turn5.\n\nWe want to be at y=9 at turn11.\n\nWe need to decide the actions for turn5,6,...,10 (7 actions) that will get us to y=9 at the beginning of turn11.\n\nBut note: the state at the beginning of turn11 is y11 = y10 + Delta(a10). And we require y11=9.\n\nBut we also require that at the beginning of turn11 we are at 9, and then we take an action? But that action doesn't affect our safety at turn11 because we are at 9 (safe). \n\nSo we only care about turns5 to 10.\n\nWe need to simulate the car positions at turns5,6,7,8,9,10.\n\nWe will compute for each freeway k and for T in {5,6,7,8,9,10} the set of intervals that are occupied by cars.\n\nFreeway 1 (k=1):\n  car1: (-28,-39,4) -> at T, left = -39+4*(T-5), right = -28+4*(T-5)\n  car2: (8,-3,4) -> left = -3+4*(T-5), right=8+4*(T-5)\n  car3: (44,33,4) -> left=33+4*(T-5), right=44+4*(T-5)\n\nLet's compute for T=5 to 10:\n\nT=5:\n  car1: [-39, -28] -> 0 not in\n  car2: [-3,8] -> 0 is in? Yes, because -3<=0<=8 -> collision if we are on freeway1 at turn5.\n\nBut we are not on freeway1 at turn5, but if we move to freeway1 at some turn, we have to avoid T when 0 is in car2's span.\n\nT=6:\n  car1: -39+4= -35, -28+4=-24 -> [-35,-24] -> no 0.\n  car2: -3+4=1, 8+4=12 -> [1,12] -> 0 not in.\n  car3: 33+4=37, 44+4=48 -> [37,48] -> no.\n\nT=7:\n  car1: -39+8=-31, -28+8=-20 -> no.\n  car2: -3+8=5, 8+8=16 -> [5,16] -> no.\n  car3: 33+8=41, 48 -> no.\n\nT=8:\n  car1: -39+12=-27, -28+12=-16 -> no.\n  car2: -3+12=9, 8+12=20 -> [9,20] -> no.\n  car3: 33+12=45, 44+12=56 -> no.\n\nT=9:\n  car1: -39+16=-23, -28+16=-12 -> no.\n  car2: -3+16=13, 8+16=24 -> [13,24] -> no.\n  car3: 33+16=49, 44+16=60 -> no.\n\nT=10:\n  car1: -39+20=-19, -28+20=-8 -> no.\n  car2: -3+20=17, 8+20=28 -> [17,28] -> no.\n  car3: 33+20=53, 44+20=64 -> no.\n\nBut at T=5, freeway1 has car2 covering [ -3, 8] which includes 0. So if we are on freeway1 at turn5, we collide.\n\nBut we are at turn5 at freeway3, not freeway1.\n\nFreeway2:\n  Only one car: (h=-12, tau=-23, right,12)\n  At T: left = -23+12*(T-5), right = -12+12*(T-5)\n\nT=5: [-23,-12] -> 0 not in.\nT=6: -23+12=-11, -12+12=0 -> [-11,0] -> 0 is in! (right endpoint included) -> collision.\nT=7: -23+24=1, -12+24=12 -> [1,12] -> 0 not in.\nT=8: 13, 24 -> no.\nT=9: 25, 36 -> no.\nT=10: 37,48 -> no.\n\nSo freeway2 is dangerous at turn6: because [ -11, 0] -> 0 is included.\n\nFreeway3:\n  Only one car: (-28,-39,4) -> as above, at T=5: [-39,-28] -> safe.\n  T=6: [-35,-24] -> safe.\n  T=7: [-31,-20] -> safe.\n  T=8: [-27,-16] -> safe.\n  T=9: [-23,-12] -> safe.\n  T=10: [-19,-8] -> safe.\n\nFreeway4:\n  Three cars: same as freeway1.\n\n  At T=5: \n      car1: [-39,-28] -> safe.\n      car2: [-3,8] -> 0 in -> dangerous.\n      car3: [33,44] -> safe.\n\n  So at T=5, freeway4 is dangerous.\n\n  T=6: \n      car1: [-35,-24] -> safe.\n      car2: [1,12] -> safe.\n      car3: [37,48] -> safe.\n\n  T=7: safe (as freeway1 at T=7)\n\n  Similarly, T=8,9,10: safe.\n\nFreeway5: same as freeway4 -> dangerous at T=5, safe at T>=6.\n\nFreeway6: same -> dangerous at T=5, safe at T>=6.\n\nFreeway7:\n  One car: (-28,-39,4) -> same as freeway3: always safe for T=5 to 10.\n\nFreeway8:\n  One car: (-28,-39,4) -> same.\n\nNow, our plan: we start at turn5 at y=3 (freeway3) -> safe.\n\nWe want to move to y=9 in 6 moves (so we would be at turn11 at 9). But we have to avoid collisions on the freeways we step on.\n\nWe will simulate the moves:\n\nWe are at:\n  turn5: y=3 (safe)\n\nThen we take an action at turn5. We can choose U, D, or S.\n\nWe want to go up, so U is preferred.\n\nIf we choose U at turn5: then at turn6, we will be at y=4.\n\nAt turn6, freeway4: we computed that at T=6, freeway4 is safe (because car2 at freeway4 at T=6: [1,12] -> 0 not in). So safe.\n\nThen at turn6: we are at y=4 (freeway4) -> safe.\n\nThen we take an action at turn6: U -> then at turn7, y=5.\n\nAt turn7, freeway5: we have to check freeway5 at T=7.\n\nFreeway5: same as freeway4? But we computed freeway4 at T=7 is safe? Actually, freeway5 at T=7: \n  The cars on freeway5: same as freeway1? \n  At T=7: \n      car1: [-39+4*(7-5)= -39+8=-31, -28+8=-20] -> safe.\n      car2: [-3+8=5, 8+8=16] -> safe.\n      car3: [33+8=41, 44+8=52] -> safe.\n\nSo safe.\n\nThen at turn7: y=5 -> freeway5: safe.\n\nThen U at turn7: turn8, y=6 -> freeway6 at T=8.\n\nFreeway6: same as freeway1 at T=8: safe.\n\nThen U at turn8: turn9, y=7 -> freeway7 at T=9.\n\nFreeway7: one car: at T=9: left=-39+4*(9-5)= -39+16=-23, right=-28+16=-12 -> [-23,-12] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\nThen U at turn9: turn10, y=8 -> freeway8 at T=10.\n\nFreeway8: at T=10: left=-39+4*(10-5)= -39+20=-19, right=-28+20=-8 -> [-19,-8] -> safe.\n\nThen U at turn10: turn11, y=9 -> safe.\n\nSo we can do all U's: \n  turn5: U -> to 4\n  turn6: U -> to 5\n  turn7: U -> to 6\n  turn8: U -> to 7\n  turn9: U -> to 8\n  turn10: U -> to 9\n\nThen at the beginning of turn11, we are at 9.\n\nBut we have taken 6 actions: turns5 to 10. But we need to output H=7 actions? \n\nThe problem: we are at 9 at turn11, which is 5+6 = 11, but we require to be at 9 at turn5+H-1 -> 5+H-1=11 -> H=7.\n\nSo we need one more action. We take an action at turn11. Since we are at 9 at the beginning of turn11, we can choose any action: U, D, or S. But if we choose U, we go to 10 which is invalid? The grid is y=0..9, so we cannot go above 9. The rule: y_{t+1} in [0,9]. So if we are at 9 and choose U, we stay at 9? Or the move is blocked? \n\nThe update rule says: y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t, and y_{t+1} in [0,9]. So if we are at 9 and choose U, we would try to go to 10, but then it is clamped to 9? Or is it invalid? The rule doesn't specify, but typically in such games, the move is blocked. So we stay at 9.\n\nSimilarly for D: if at 0 and choose D, we stay at 0.\n\nSo we can choose any action at turn11: \n  If we choose U: then y12 = min(9, 9+1)=9.\n  D: y12 = max(0,9-1)=8 -> then we leave 9, but we were at 9 at turn11, so that satisfies the condition? \n  S: stay at 9.\n\nBut the requirement is to be at 9 at the beginning of turn11. We are, and then we take an action. So we can choose S to stay at 9.\n\nSo the sequence would be 7 actions: \n  turn5: U\n  turn6: U\n  turn7: U\n  turn8: U\n  turn9: U\n  turn10: U\n  turn11: S   (or U, but then we stay at 9)\n\nBut note: at turn11, we are at 9 and then we take an action. Then at turn12, we are still at 9? But we don't care.\n\nSo the minimal H is 7, and the sequence of 7 actions.\n\nBut is there a way to get to 9 earlier? For example, at turn10? \n\nTo be at 9 at the beginning of turn10, we would have to go from 3 to 9 in 5 moves? That requires 6 steps in 5 moves? Impossible.\n\nTherefore, we must use 7 actions.\n\nBut let me verify if there is any collision along the way with the above plan:\n\n  turn5: y=3 -> freeway3: safe (as computed)\n  turn6: y=4 -> freeway4: at T=6, car2: [1,12] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n  turn7: y=5 -> freeway5: at T=7, safe.\n  turn8: y=6 -> freeway6: at T=8, safe.\n  turn9: y=7 -> freeway7: at T=9, safe.\n  turn10: y=8 -> freeway8: at T=10, safe.\n\nSo safe.\n\nBut what about freeway2? We never step on freeway2? We went from 3 to 4 to 5 to 6 to 7 to 8 to 9. So we skipped freeway2? \n\nFreeway2 is at y=2. We are going upward from 3 to 9, so we never go to 2. So we are safe.\n\nBut wait, freeway2 is dangerous at turn6: if we were at freeway2 at turn6, we would collide. But we are at freeway4 at turn6, not freeway2.\n\nSo the plan is safe.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 7, and the sequence is:\n\nTurn5: U\nTurn6: U\nTurn7: U\nTurn8: U\nTurn9: U\nTurn10: U\nTurn11: S   (we choose S to stay, but U or D would also be acceptable? But the problem doesn't specify, but to minimize disturbance we choose S. However, any action is acceptable at the last step.)\n\nBut the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and we have H=7. And the sequence is 7 actions.\n\nWe output:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: S\n}\n\nBut note: the last action is at turn11, which is t1+6? But we need to output up to turn t1+H-1 = 5+7-1=11, so that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, we could do:\n\n  Turn11: U  -> then we stay at 9? \n  or Turn11: D -> then we go to 8? \n\nBut the requirement is only to be at 9 at the beginning of turn11. The action at turn11 doesn't affect that. So we can choose any. But to be safe, we choose S.\n\nBut what if we choose D at turn11? Then at turn12 we are at 8, but we don't care. And at turn11 we are at 9 (safe). \n\nBut the problem does not require us to stay at 9. So any action is acceptable.\n\nI'll choose S.\n\nBut let me check if we can avoid the last action? That is, can we be at 9 at turn10? \n\nTo be at 9 at turn10, we need to get from 3 to 9 in 5 moves: \n  5 moves: we need to go up 6 steps -> impossible.\n\nSo we must do 6 moves to get to 9 at turn11, and then one extra action (the 7th) at turn11.\n\nTherefore, the answer is as above.\n\nBut note: we must avoid freeway2 at turn6? But we are not on freeway2. So no issue.\n\nBut what if we had to go through freeway2? We didn't.\n\nBut is there a shorter path? We don't need to consider down moves because that would take more moves.\n\nSo the above is optimal.\n\nBut wait: what if we wait at some freeway to avoid a car? But in this case, we didn't encounter any car that forces us to wait. The dangerous freeways (like freeway4 at turn5) we avoided by not being there at turn5. We were at freeway4 at turn6, which was safe.\n\nBut what about freeway5 at turn5? We were not there. And at turn6, freeway5? But we were at freeway4 at turn6, then freeway5 at turn7.\n\nBut freeway5 at turn6: \n   T=6: \n        car1: -39+4= -35, -28+4=-24 -> safe.\n        car2: -3+4=1, 8+4=12 -> safe.\n        car3: 33+4=37, 44+4=48 -> safe.\n\nSo even if we had been at freeway5 at turn6, it would be safe. Similarly, freeway6 at turn6: safe.\n\nSo we could have moved faster? But we are moving as fast as possible.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is:\n\nTurn5: U\nTurn6: U\nTurn7: U\nTurn8: U\nTurn9: U\nTurn10: U\nTurn11: S\n\nBut note: at turn10 we are at y=8, then we do U to go to 9 at turn11. Then at turn11 we do S. \n\nBut we could do:\n\n  Turn10: U -> then at turn11 we are at 9, and then we do nothing? But we have to output 7 actions.\n\nSo we must include an action at turn11.\n\nAlternatively, we could do:\n\n  Turn5: S  (wait) and then later move up? But that would take more than 7 actions? So not minimal.\n\nTherefore, the above is the minimal.\n\nBut let me check if we can do it in 7 actions but with a different sequence? For example, if we do a down move? That would be worse.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: S\n}\n\nBut to be precise, we can choose any action at turn11. Let me choose S.\n\nHowever, the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and we have H=7. And we have 7 actions.\n\nBut note: the initial turn is turn5, and we take actions at 5,6,7,8,9,10,11 -> 7 actions, and we are at 9 at turn11 (the beginning of turn11) -> satisfies.\n\nSo we output.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 3)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 5\\) is 7. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\) by moving upward exclusively, as no car spans cover the player's path at the required turns.\n\n### Verification of Collision Avoidance:\n- **Turn 5 (\\(y = 3\\)):**  \n  Freeway 3 has one car: head = -28, tail = -39, direction = right, speed = 4.  \n  Span at turn 5: \\([-39 + 4 \\times 0, -28 + 4 \\times 0] = [-39, -28]\\).  \n  \\(0 \\notin [-39, -28]\\) → safe.\n\n- **Turn 6 (\\(y = 4\\)):**  \n  Freeway 4 has three cars:  \n  - Car 1: \\([-39 + 4 \\times 1, -28 + 4 \\times 1] = [-35, -24]\\) → \\(0 \\notin [-35, -24]\\).  \n  - Car 2: \\([-3 + 4 \\times 1, 8 + 4 \\times 1] = [1, 12]\\) → \\(0 \\notin [1, 12]\\).  \n  - Car 3: \\([33 + 4 \\times 1, 44 + 4 \\times 1] = [37, 48]\\) → \\(0 \\notin [37, 48]\\).  \n  All spans safe.\n\n- **Turn 7 (\\(y = 5\\)):**  \n  Freeway 5 (same cars as freeway 4):  \n  - Car 1: \\([-39 + 4 \\times 2, -28 + 4 \\times 2] = [-31, -20]\\) → safe.  \n  - Car 2: \\([-3 + 4 \\times 2, 8 + 4 \\times 2] = [5, 16]\\) → safe.  \n  - Car 3: \\([33 + 4 \\times 2, 44 + 4 \\times 2] = [41, 52]\\) → safe.\n\n- **Turn 8 (\\(y = 6\\)):**  \n  Freeway 6 (same cars):  \n  - Car 1: \\([-39 + 4 \\times 3, -28 + 4 \\times 3] = [-27, -16]\\) → safe.  \n  - Car 2: \\([-3 + 4 \\times 3, 8 + 4 \\times 3] = [9, 20]\\) → safe.  \n  - Car 3: \\([33 + 4 \\times 3, 44 + 4 \\times 3] = [45, 56]\\) → safe.\n\n- **Turn 9 (\\(y = 7\\)):**  \n  Freeway 7 has one car: head = -28, tail = -39, direction = right, speed = 4.  \n  Span at turn 9: \\([-39 + 4 \\times 4, -28 + 4 \\times 4] = [-23, -12]\\).  \n  \\(0 \\notin [-23, -12]\\) → safe.\n\n- **Turn 10 (\\(y = 8\\)):**  \n  Freeway 8 has one car: head = -28, tail = -39, direction = right, speed = 4.  \n  Span at turn 10: \\([-39 + 4 \\times 5, -28 + 4 \\times 5] = [-19, -8]\\).  \n  \\(0 \\notin [-19, -8]\\) → safe.\n\n- **Turn 11 (\\(y = 9\\)):**  \n  \\(y = 9\\) is not a freeway (freeways are \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\)), so no collision check is needed.

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,4) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to 8. The current turn is t₁ = 6.\n\nFirst, I should understand the car positions and how they move. All cars are moving right, and I have their positions at turn t₁=6.\n\nThe collision condition is that at turn T, if I'm on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there's a car where 0 is in its span at that turn. Since I'm always at x=0, I care about when a car's span includes x=0.\n\nAlso, when I move, I'm not on the new freeway until the next turn. So if I move from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T I'm still on y, and at turn T+1 I'm on y+1. So I only check for collision on the freeway I'm currently on at each turn.\n\nThe player position is updated after the action, but the collision is checked based on where I am after the move, I think. Let me read carefully.\n\n\"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd y_T is the player's y-position at turn T.\n\nAlso, \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T\", which makes sense.\n\nSo at each turn T, I have a position y_T, and I need that for the cars on freeway y_T, 0 is not in their span at turn T.\n\nNow, the cars move with constant speed. Since all are moving right, for a car with initial head h, tail τ at t₁, speed s, at time T, span is [τ + s(T - t₁), h + s(T - t₁)] for right-moving, since head is at h, tail at τ, and it moves right, so head increases.\n\nIn the car update:\n\nRight-moving: Span(T) = [τ + s(T - t₁), h + s(T - t₁)]\n\nAnd since head is larger for right-moving, I assume h > τ for right-moving cars.\n\nIn the initial state, for freeway 1: (-24, -35, right, 4). -24 and -35? -24 > -35, so head is -24, tail is -35? That seems odd because usually head is the front, but if moving right, and tail is smaller, then yes, head is larger.\n\nLet's clarify: for a right-moving car, at position, head h is the right end, tail τ is the left end, so h > τ. When moving right, both increase.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but here all are right-moving.\n\nIn freeway 1: cars: (-24, -35, right, 4), so h = -24, τ = -35? -24 > -35, so head is -24, tail is -35, which means the car spans from x=-35 to x=-24? That would be length 11, but let's see.\n\nx from τ to h, so if τ = -35, h = -24, then span is from -35 to -24.\n\nBut at turn T, for right-moving, span is [τ + s(T-t₁), h + s(T-t₁)]\n\nSimilarly, (12,1,right,4): h=12, τ=1? 12>1, so span from 1 to 12? But τ=1, h=12, so [1,12] at t₁.\n\nAnd (48,37,right,4): h=48, τ=37, span [37,48].\n\nBut let's list all freeways.\n\nt₁ = 6.\n\nPlayer at (0,4)\n\nCars:\n\nFreeway 1: three cars: \n\nCar A: h=-24, τ=-35, d=right, s=4 → at T, span: [ -35 + 4(T-6), -24 + 4(T-6) ]\n\nCar B: h=12, τ=1, d=right, s=4 → [1 + 4(T-6), 12 + 4(T-6)]\n\nCar C: h=48, τ=37, d=right, s=4 → [37 + 4(T-6), 48 + 4(T-6)]\n\nFreeway 2: one car: (0, -11, right, 12) → h=0, τ=-11, s=12\n\nAt T, span: [ -11 + 12(T-6), 0 + 12(T-6) ] = [12(T-6) -11, 12(T-6)]\n\nFreeway 3: one car: (-24, -35, right, 4) → same as freeway 1 car A: [ -35 + 4(T-6), -24 + 4(T-6) ]\n\nFreeway 4: three cars, same as freeway 1: A, B, C equivalents.\n\nCar A: [ -35 + 4(T-6), -24 + 4(T-6) ]\n\nCar B: [1 + 4(T-6), 12 + 4(T-6)]\n\nCar C: [37 + 4(T-6), 48 + 4(T-6)]\n\nFreeway 5: same, three cars identical to above.\n\nFreeway 6: same.\n\nFreeway 7: one car: (-24, -35, right, 4) → same as A.\n\nFreeway 8: one car: (-24, -35, right, 4) → same.\n\nNow, I need to get to y=9 from y=4.\n\ny=9 is the goal, and there are no cars on y=9, I assume, since freeways are 1 to 8.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are not freeways, I think. y=0 is the bottom, y=9 top, freeways in between.\n\nPlayer can be on y=0 or y=9, but no cars there.\n\nNow, to reach (0,9), which is x=0, y=9.\n\nMinimal turns: since I'm at y=4, and need to go to y=9, that's 5 steps up if I go directly, but I might need to wait or go down to avoid cars.\n\nEach action U increases y by 1, D decreases, S stays.\n\ny between 0 and 9, so I can't go below 0 or above 9.\n\nNow, I need to find a sequence of actions from t=6 onwards.\n\nLet me denote time t starting from t=6.\n\nAt t=6, I am at y=4.\n\nI need to find for each future turn, whether I can be on y=4,5,6,7,8 without collision.\n\ny=9 is the goal, and since no cars, I can be there safely.\n\nBut I need to reach it, so when I move to y=9, I don't check collision for y=9, I think, because no freeway there.\n\nThe collision is only for freeways y=1 to 8, I believe.\n\n\"avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y = 1, …, 8.\"\n\nSo when I am on y=0 or y=9, no collision possible.\n\nSimilarly, at y=0, I might not be able to go down, but since y=0, D would keep me at 0 or something, but let's see the update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, with y in [0,9], so if at y=0 and action D, y_{t+1} = max(0, y_t -1) =0, I assume. Similarly at y=9, U keeps at 9.\n\nBut in this case, I start at y=4, need to go to y=9.\n\nNow, to minimize turns, I should go up as much as possible, but I need to avoid times when on a freeway, x=0 is covered by a car.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway and each time, whether x=0 is occupied.\n\nSince the cars move, I need to compute for each freeway, at time T, if there is a car where 0 is in [low, high] of its span.\n\nFor a given freeway k and time T, if for any car on k, 0 is between τ + s(T-t₁) and h + s(T-t₁) inclusive? Since it's a span, I assume it's inclusive.\n\nNow, for freeway 1: cars A,B,C\n\nCar A: low = -35 + 4(T-6), high = -24 + 4(T-6)\n\n0 in [low, high] if low ≤ 0 ≤ high\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSimilarly for other freeways.\n\nt₁=6, so let u = T - 6, time offset.\n\nSet u = T - 6, so u=0 is turn 6, u=1 turn 7, etc.\n\nAt u=0, T=6.\n\nFor freeway 1:\n\nCar A: low = -35 + 4u, high = -24 + 4u\n\n0 in [low, high] if -35 +4u ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ -24 +4u\n\nSimilarly, Car B: low = 1 + 4u, high = 12 + 4u\n\n0 in [1+4u, 12+4u] if 1+4u ≤ 0 ≤ 12+4u\n\nBut 1+4u ≤ 0 implies 4u ≤ -1, u ≤ -0.25, impossible since u≥0. And 0 ≤ 12+4u always true for u≥0? No.\n\n0 ≤ 12+4u always true since 12+4u ≥12>0 for u≥0.\n\nBut for 0 to be in [1+4u, 12+4u], we need 1+4u ≤ 0 ≤ 12+4u.\n\nBut 1+4u ≤ 0 only if u ≤ -0.25, impossible. So for all u≥0, 0 < 1+4u ≤ low, so 0 not in [1+4u, 12+4u] because low =1+4u ≥1 >0 for u≥0.\n\nAt u=0, low=1, high=12, 0<1, so not in.\n\nSimilarly for u>0, low increases, so 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, Car C: low=37+4u, high=48+4u, both >0 for u≥0, so 0 not in.\n\nNow Car A: low = -35 +4u, high = -24 +4u\n\n0 in if -35 +4u ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ -24 +4u\n\nWhich is 4u ≤ 35 and 4u ≥ 24? Let's see:\n\n-35 +4u ≤ 0 => 4u ≤ 35 => u ≤ 35/4 = 8.75\n\n0 ≤ -24 +4u => 4u ≥ 24 => u ≥ 6\n\nSo for Car A on freeway 1, 0 in span when u between 6 and 8.75, i.e., u=6,7,8 since u integer? T is turn, so u integer.\n\nu = T-6, integer.\n\nAt u=6, T=12: low = -35 +4*6 = -35+24= -11, high= -24+24=0? -24+24=0, so [ -11, 0 ], 0 is included? high=0, so [low, high] includes 0 if low≤0≤high.\n\nAt u=6: low=-11, high=0, so 0 ≤ 0 is true, and -11≤0 true, so yes, 0 in span.\n\nu=7: low=-35+28= -7, high=-24+28=4, [ -7,4], 0 in.\n\nu=8: low=-35+32= -3, high=-24+32=8, [ -3,8], 0 in.\n\nu=9: low=-35+36=1, high=-24+36=12, [1,12], 0 not <=0? 0<1, not in.\n\nu=6,7,8: 0 in span for Car A.\n\nBut Car B and C never have 0 in span for u≥0.\n\nSo for freeway 1, at u=6,7,8, occupied by Car A.\n\nu=6: T=12, u=7:T=13, u=8:T=14.\n\nNow freeway 2: one car: h=0, τ=-11, s=12\n\nAt u, low = -11 + 12u, high = 0 + 12u = 12u\n\n0 in [low, high] if -11 +12u ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ 12u\n\n0 ≤ 12u always for u≥0.\n\n-11+12u ≤ 0 => 12u ≤ 11 => u ≤ 11/12 ≈ 0.916\n\nSo only possible for u=0? u=0: low=-11, high=0, so [ -11, 0], 0 ≤0 true, so 0 in span.\n\nu=1: low=-11+12=1, high=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nu=0 only.\n\nAt u=0, T=6, freeway 2 has a car with span [ -11, 0] at T=6, so x=0 is covered.\n\nNow freeway 3: one car, same as freeway 1 Car A: (-24,-35,right,4)\n\nSo same as above: 0 in span for u=6,7,8.\n\nFreeway 4: three cars, same as freeway 1: Car A, B, C.\n\nCar A: occupied u=6,7,8\n\nCar B: never\n\nCar C: never\n\nSo same as freeway 1.\n\nSimilarly freeway 5: same\n\nFreeway 6: same\n\nFreeway 7: one car, same as Car A: occupied u=6,7,8\n\nFreeway 8: one car, same: occupied u=6,7,8\n\nNow, for each freeway, at each time, when is it occupied at x=0.\n\nBut I need for each freeway, at time T, if occupied.\n\nSince I might be on different freeways at different times.\n\nFirst, at u=0, T=6, I am at y=4.\n\nFreeway 4: at u=0, is it occupied?\n\nFreeway 4 has cars: Car A at u=0: low=-35, high=-24, both negative, so 0 not in [-35,-24]\n\nCar B: low=1, high=12, 0 not in\n\nCar C: low=37, high=48, not\n\nSo freeway 4 at T=6 is not occupied? But I need to check for each.\n\nFreeway 4 cars same as freeway 1.\n\nAt u=0: Car A: [-35,-24], 0 not in\n\nCar B: [1,12], not\n\nCar C: [37,48], not\n\nSo freeway 4 clear at u=0.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2 at u=0: occupied, as above.\n\nBut I am at y=4, freeway 4.\n\nAt time T=6, I am on y=4, freeway 4.\n\nIs freeway 4 occupied at x=0 at T=6?\n\nAs above, no, all cars have spans not covering 0.\n\nCar A: [-35,-24], 0 not in\n\nCar B: [1,12], min x=1>0\n\nCar C: [37,48]>0\n\nSo yes, freeway 4 clear at T=6.\n\nNow, I need to go to y=9.\n\nPossible actions: U, D, S.\n\nI need to choose actions to move up without being on a freeway when it's occupied at x=0.\n\nNow, let's list for each freeway y=1 to 8, for each u (T-6), when it is occupied at x=0.\n\nStart with y=1: freeway 1\n\nOccupied when u=6,7,8 (T=12,13,14)\n\ny=2: freeway 2\n\nOccupied only at u=0 (T=6)\n\ny=3: freeway 3\n\nOne car, same as y=1 car A, occupied u=6,7,8\n\ny=4: freeway 4\n\nCars A,B,C: occupied only when Car A is, u=6,7,8\n\ny=5: same as y=4, occupied u=6,7,8\n\ny=6: same, occupied u=6,7,8\n\ny=7: freeway 7, one car, occupied u=6,7,8\n\ny=8: freeway 8, one car, occupied u=6,7,8\n\nNow, for y=2, occupied only at u=0, which is now, T=6.\n\nBut at T=6, I am not on y=2, I am on y=4.\n\nNow, I need to move from y=4 to y=9.\n\nThe minimal number of turns: if I go up directly, I need 5 moves: U,U,U,U,U to go from 4 to 9 in 5 steps.\n\nBut I might need to wait if some freeway is occupied when I am on it.\n\nNow, let's see the times when each freeway is occupied.\n\nFor y=4,5,6,7,8: all occupied from u=6 to u=8, i.e., T=12 to T=14.\n\nBut I am at u=0, T=6, and I need to reach y=9 by some H.\n\nu from 0 onwards.\n\nI need to be on y=9 at some turn.\n\nThe sequence of actions: at each turn, I choose action, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nStart at t=6, u=0, y=4.\n\nI choose action a_{6}, which affects y_{7}.\n\nNotation: at turn T, I am at position y_T, I choose action a_T, which determines y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy.\n\nThen at turn T, I am on y_T, and I check collision for freeway y_T at time T.\n\nFor example, at T=6, I am on y=4, and freeway 4 at T=6 is not occupied, so safe.\n\nThen I choose a_6, which could be U, D, S.\n\nIf U, y_7 =5; if S, y_7=4; if D, y_7=3.\n\nThen at T=7, I am on y_7, and check collision for that freeway at time T=7.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nI need y_{t} =9 for some t, and H is the number of turns from start to that point.\n\nThe sequence is from t=6 to t=6+H-1, and at t=6+H-1, y=9.\n\nt=6 is turn 0 in u, let's use u.\n\nSet u=0: turn 6, y=4\n\nAfter action, at u=1: turn 7, y depends on action.\n\nAt time u, I am at y_u.\n\nThen I choose action a_u, which sets y_{u+1} = y_u + delta.\n\nBut the turn is t = 6 + u.\n\nAt turn t=6+u, position y_{6+u}.\n\nTo simplify, let's work with u, time offset.\n\nu=0: turn 6, y=4\n\nAction a_0 for turn 6.\n\nThen u=1: turn 7, y_1 = y_0 + delta from a_0\n\nAnd so on.\n\nCollision at time u: for freeway y_u, at time u (which is T-6, but time is absolute, but since we care about span, and span depends on T, which is 6+u.\n\nBut in the span calculation, I used u = T-6, so at time u, span is based on u.\n\nFor example, at time u, for a car, span is as computed with that u.\n\nAnd freeway y_u at time u.\n\nI need to find a sequence of actions from u=0 to some H-1, such that at some u_final, y_{u_final} =9, and for each u from 0 to u_final-1, when I am on y_u, it is not occupied at time u.\n\nAt u_final, I am on y=9, which has no cars, so no issue.\n\nThe minimal H such that I reach y=9 in H steps, meaning from u=0 to u=H-1, I have actions, and at u=H-1, y=9.\n\nNumber of turns: from turn 6 to turn 6 + (H-1), so H turns? Let's see.\n\nAt turn 6: u=0, action a_0\n\nTurn 7: u=1, action a_1\n\n...\n\nAfter k actions, at turn 6+k, y_{6+k}\n\nI need y_{6+k} =9 for some k, and k is the number of actions, so H = k+1? The number of turns from start to end.\n\nThe sequence is for turns t=6 to t=6 + H -1, with H actions, and at turn t=6 + H -1, position is (0,9).\n\nFor example, if I do nothing, at turn 6, y=4, not 9.\n\nAfter one action at turn 6, at turn 7, y could be 3,4,5.\n\nTo reach y=9 from y=4, I need at least 5 Up actions, but I might have S or D, so H >=5.\n\nMinimal H is 5 if I can go directly up without collision.\n\nBut let's see if I can.\n\nStart u=0, y=4, freeway 4 not occupied.\n\nI can go U, to y=5 at u=1.\n\nu=1, turn 7, y=5, freeway 5.\n\nIs freeway 5 occupied at u=1?\n\nFreeway 5: same as others, cars occupied only at u=6,7,8, not at u=1.\n\nu=1, T=7, u=1.\n\nFreeway 5 at u=1: not occupied, as per earlier.\n\nSimilarly, I can go U to y=6 at u=2.\n\nu=2, y=6, freeway 6 at u=2: not occupied, since occupied only u=6,7,8.\n\nu=2 is early.\n\nSimilarly, U to y=7 at u=3.\n\nu=3, y=7, freeway 7 at u=3: not occupied.\n\nU to y=8 at u=4.\n\nu=4, y=8, freeway 8 at u=4: not occupied, since occupied u=6,7,8, u=4<6.\n\nThen U to y=9 at u=5.\n\nAt u=5, y=9, which is not a freeway, no collision.\n\nSo in 5 actions: U,U,U,U,U from u=0 to u=4, reaching y=9 at u=5.\n\nu=0: turn 6, action U, then at turn 7 (u=1), y=5\n\nu=1: turn 7, action U, turn 8 (u=2), y=6\n\nu=2: turn 8, action U, turn 9 (u=3), y=7\n\nu=3: turn 9, action U, turn 10 (u=4), y=8\n\nu=4: turn 10, action U, turn 11 (u=5), y=9\n\nNow, at each turn, when on freeway, was it occupied?\n\nAt turn 6 (u=0): y=4, freeway 4, not occupied, safe.\n\nTurn 7 (u=1): y=5, freeway 5, not occupied, safe.\n\nTurn 8 (u=2): y=6, freeway 6, not occupied, safe.\n\nTurn 9 (u=3): y=7, freeway 7, not occupied, safe.\n\nTurn 10 (u=4): y=8, freeway 8, not occupied, safe.\n\nThen at turn 11 (u=5): y=9, no freeway, done.\n\nSo it seems I can reach in 5 turns, with all U.\n\nBut is freeway 8 safe at u=4? u=4, T=10.\n\nFreeway 8 occupied at u=6,7,8, u=4 is before, so yes.\n\nSimilarly all good.\n\nBut what about freeway 2? It was occupied at u=0, but I was not on it at that time.\n\nI was on y=4 at u=0.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nSo minimal H=5, sequence: all U.\n\nBut let's confirm the actions.\n\nTurn t=6: action a_{t1} = a_6 = U\n\nThen at turn 7, y=5\n\nTurn 7: a_7 = U\n\nTurn 8, y=6\n\nTurn 8: a_8 = U\n\nTurn 9, y=7\n\nTurn 9: a_9 = U\n\nTurn 10, y=8\n\nTurn 10: a_10 = U\n\nTurn 11, y=9\n\nAnd H=5? From turn 6 to turn 11, that's 6 turns? Turns: 6,7,8,9,10,11. That's 6 turns, but positions: at turn 6 start, after actions.\n\nNumber of actions: from turn 6 to turn 10, 5 actions: a6 to a10, and at turn 11, y=9.\n\nThe sequence is for turns from t1 to t1 + H -1, so turns t=6 to t=6+H-1, with actions, and at turn t=6+H-1, position (0,9).\n\nFor H=5, turns: 6,7,8,9,10 with actions a6 to a10, and at turn 11, position (0,9)? Turn 11 is after action a10.\n\nLet's clarify.\n\nAt turn T, I am at position y_T, then I perform action a_T, which sets y_{T+1}.\n\nAfter action a_T, at turn T+1, I am at y_{T+1}.\n\nI reach (0,9) when at some turn T, y_T =9.\n\nIn the sequence, the actions are from turn t1 to turn t1 + H -1, meaning a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H -1}, and after these H actions, at turn (t1 + H -1) +1 = t1 + H, y_{t1 + H} =9.\n\nFor example, with H actions, I reach at turn t1 + H.\n\nIn this case, from turn 6, after 5 actions (U at t6 to t10), at turn 11, y=9.\n\nSo the last action is at turn t1 + H -1 = 10, and position at turn 11 is (0,9).\n\nH=5, turns for actions: t=6 to t=10.\n\nIn the sequence, we list actions for turns t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nHere t1=6, H=5, so actions for turn 6 to turn 10.\n\nBut in my earlier, I have a6=U, a7=U, a8=U, a9=U, a10=U.\n\nAnd at turn 11, y=9.\n\nNow, is there any problem? At any point, was I on a freeway when occupied?\n\nAt turn 6: y=4, freeway 4, u=0, not occupied.\n\nTurn 7: y=5, freeway 5, u=1, not occupied (since occupied only u=6,7,8)\n\nu=1, T=7, freeway 5 at T=7: u=1, not in 6-8, so safe.\n\nSimilarly turn 8: y=6, u=2, safe.\n\nTurn 9: y=7, u=3, safe.\n\nTurn 10: y=8, u=4, safe.\n\nu=4, T=10, freeway 8 at T=10: u=4, occupied only at u=6,7,8, so u=4<6, safe.\n\nYes.\n\nBut what about freeway 2 at u=0? But I was not on it.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nBut in freeway 2, at u=0, it is occupied, but since I am not on it, no issue.\n\nSo it seems fine.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), and I can do it in 5 turns.\n\nBut let me double-check if all freeways are safe at those times.\n\nFor example, freeway 5: at u=1, T=7.\n\nFreeway 5 cars: same as freeway 1.\n\nAt u=1: Car A: low=-35+4(1)= -31, high=-24+4= -20, both negative, 0 not in.\n\nCar B: low=1+4(1)=5, high=12+4=16, 0 not in.\n\nCar C: low=37+4=41, high=48+4=52, not.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut for freeway 8, at u=4, T=10.\n\nFreeway 8 has one car: same as Car A: low=-35+4*4= -35+16= -19, high=-24+16= -8, both negative, 0 not in.\n\nSince u=4 <6.\n\nOccupied only from u=6.\n\nu=6: low=-35+24= -11, high=-24+24=0, [ -11,0], 0 included.\n\nBut u=4 is fine.\n\nSo yes.\n\nTherefore, I can go directly up in 5 steps.\n\nBut the answer should be H=5, sequence U for each turn.\n\nBut let's see if there is any constraint I missed.\n\nThe player starts at (0,4), and I need to output the actions.\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 2, at t=6, there is a car with head at 0, tail -11, so at x=0, it is occupied, but on freeway 2, not 4.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if I need to avoid being on certain rows at certain times, but in this case, not necessary.\n\nTo be thorough, let's see when freeways are occupied.\n\nFor example, y=1 occupied at u=6,7,8\n\ny=2 at u=0\n\ny=3 at u=6,7,8\n\ny=4 at u=6,7,8\n\netc.\n\nSince I go through y=4 to 8 from u=0 to u=4, which is before u=6, all safe.\n\nu=0 to u=4 for positions, u=0:y4, u=1:y5, u=2:y6, u=3:y7, u=4:y8, all u<6, so not during occupation period.\n\ny=2 occupied only at u=0, but I never go to y=2 or below in this path.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 5.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\"\n\nIn this case, H=5.\n\nBut let me see if H can be less? From y=4 to y=9, difference 5, so at least 5 Up actions needed, so H at least 5. Cannot be less.\n\nIf I do S or D, it takes more turns, so minimal is 5.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n\nBut in the output format, I need to list the actions.\n\nFor turn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nAnd H=5.\n\nBut in the sequence, it should be for turns t1 to t1+H-1, which is 6 to 10.\n\nThen at turn 11, position (0,9).\n\nNow, about the collision note: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T\"\n\nIn this case, when I move from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T I am on y, and at turn T+1 on y+1.\n\nIn my actions, at each turn, I move up, so at turn T, I am on y_T, and I move to y_T+1, so at turn T, I am on the current freeway, which I checked is safe.\n\nFor example, at turn 10, I am on y=8, freeway 8, which is safe at T=10 (u=4), then I move to y=9, at turn 11.\n\nNo issue.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nBut let me check if at some point, when I move, the next position might be occupied, but no, because collision is only checked at the current turn for current freeway.\n\nThe note says that when I move, at turn T, I am not on the new freeway yet, so I don't check collision for the new freeway at turn T.\n\nBut in this case, since I only care about current freeway at current time, it should be ok.\n\nIn my plan, I never encounter a situation where I move and might be on a freeway at wrong time.\n\nSo I think H=5 with all U is correct.\n\nBut perhaps I should consider if for some freeway, at the time I am on it, it is occupied.\n\nFor example, suppose I were to be on y=4 at u=6, but in this case, I am not.\n\nIn my path, I am on y=4 at u=0, not at u=6.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps for y=2, at u=0 it is occupied, but I am not on it.\n\nSo no.\n\nTherefore, the sequence should be:\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nAnd H=5.\n\nBut in the answer format, I need to box it.\n\nBut let me write it properly.\n\nThe minimal number of turns H=5.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 6: a_{6} = U\n\nTurn 7: a_{7} = U\n\nTurn 8: a_{8} = U\n\nTurn 9: a_{9} = U\n\nTurn 10: a_{10} = U\n\nAnd after that, at turn 11, position (0,9).\n\nNow, I think that's it.\n\nBut the problem says \"reach (0,9)\", and I do.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's see if I can do it in H=4? Impossible, because from y=4, after 4 actions, y can be at most 8 if all U, but y=8 is not 9, so I need to reach y=9, so after k actions, y can be from 4-k to 4+k, but since y<=9, to reach 9, need at least 5 U actions, so H min 5.\n\nIf I do S, I stay, but that increases H, so not minimal.\n\nSimilarly, D would make it worse.\n\nSo H=5 is minimal.\n\nThus, the answer.\n</think>\nThe goal is to reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 4) at turn \\(t_1 = 6\\) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\), avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\).\n\n### Analysis:\n- The player starts at (0, 4) at turn 6.\n- To reach (0, 9), the player must increase their y-coordinate by 5, requiring at least 5 \"U\" (up) actions, as each \"U\" increases y by 1, and \"S\" (stay) or \"D\" (down) would increase the number of turns.\n- The car states and their movements were analyzed to determine safe times to be on each freeway. Key points:\n  - Freeway 2 is occupied at x=0 only at turn 6 (u=0), but the player is not on freeway 2 at this time.\n  - Freeways 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 are occupied at x=0 only during turns 12 to 14 (u=6 to 8), which is after the relevant turns for the minimal path.\n- A direct upward path is feasible:\n  - At turn 6 (u=0), on freeway 4: not occupied.\n  - At turn 7 (u=1), on freeway 5: not occupied.\n  - At turn 8 (u=2), on freeway 6: not occupied.\n  - At turn 9 (u=3), on freeway 7: not occupied.\n  - At turn 10 (u=4), on freeway 8: not occupied.\n- After 5 \"U\" actions starting from turn 6, the player reaches (0, 9) at turn 11.\n- \\(H = 5\\) is minimal, as fewer turns cannot achieve y=9 from y=4.\n\n### Action Sequence:\n- Turn 6: action \\(a_6 = U\\) → position at turn 7: (0, 5)\n- Turn 7: action \\(a_7 = U\\) → position at turn 8: (0, 6)\n- Turn 8: action \\(a_8 = U\\) → position at turn 9: (0, 7)\n- Turn 9: action \\(a_9 = U\\) → position at turn 10: (0, 8)\n- Turn 10: action \\(a_{10} = U\\) → position at turn 11: (0, 9)\n\nNo collisions occur, as all freeways occupied during the path (y=4 to y=8) are safe at the respective turns.\n\n\\boxed{5}  \nTurn 6: U  \nTurn 7: U  \nTurn 8: U  \nTurn 9: U  \nTurn 10: U",

        "thinking": "<think>We are given the current turn t1=7 and the player is at (0,5). The goal is to reach (0,9) in minimal turns H, avoiding collisions.\n\nThe vertical grid is from y=0 to y=9. The freeways (where cars are) are y=1 to y=8. The player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S). The player's y-position is updated as:\n  U: y+1 (if y<9)\n  D: y-1 (if y>0)\n  S: y remains.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if the player is on a freeway y (from 1 to 8) and at that turn T, the player's x=0 is inside the span of any car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nImportant note: when moving from y to y' at turn T, at the moment of the move (turn T) the player is still on the old row y. Then at the next turn (T+1) the player is on the new row y'. So, when moving at turn T, we only check the cars on the freeway of the current row (y) at turn T.\n\nWe are given the car state at turn t1=7 for each freeway (1 to 8). Each car is described by (head, tail, direction, speed). Note the direction is either left or right, but in the update:\n  Left-moving: span at T is [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]   (and note the head is the front, so for left-moving the head is at the right end? Actually, the problem says for left-moving: initial span [h, tau] -> [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]. This implies that for left-moving, h is the rightmost point and tau the leftmost? But wait: at t1, the span is [h, tau]. Then as time passes, the car moves left, so both endpoints decrease.\n\nBut note the representation for right-moving: [tau, h] -> [tau+s*(T-t1), h+s*(T-t1)]. So for right-moving, the tail tau is the left end and head h is the right end? Actually, the problem says for right-moving: span(t1)=[tau, h] and then at T: [tau+s*(T-t1), h+s*(T-t1)].\n\nSo let me clarify:\n\nFor a left-moving car:\n  At t1: the car occupies from tau to h (with tau <= h) and then moves left. So the entire car moves left. The head (which is the front) is at h (the right end) and the tail at tau (the left end). But the span is given as [h, tau] which would be from h to tau, but if tau is less than h then that would be a negative interval? Actually, the numbers provided have negative numbers and positive.\n\nLooking at the data: \n  Freeway 1: (-20, -31, right, 4) -> but for right-moving, the representation is [tau, h] so [ -31, -20 ]? Then at turn 7: the car is from -31 to -20? Then moving right at speed 4 per turn.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, the representation [h, tau] would be [h, tau] and then both decrease.\n\nBut note: in the given data, all cars are right-moving? Actually, the direction is given as \"right\" for all. So we only have right-moving cars.\n\nSo for each car on freeway k, at turn T (>=t1=7), the car's span is [tau + s*(T-7), h + s*(T-7)] for a right-moving car.\n\nCollision: at turn T, if the player is on freeway y (which is between 1 and 8) and 0 (the player's x) is in the span of any car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nNote: the player is at (0, y_t) at turn t. So at turn T, if y_T is between 1 and 8, we must check all cars on freeway y_T at turn T.\n\nOur plan: we start at turn 7 at y=5. We need to get to y=9. The minimal H in terms of vertical moves: we need to go from 5 to 9: that's 4 steps up. But we might have to wait (or even go down) to avoid collisions.\n\nWe are to output a sequence of actions starting at turn 7 (t=0 in our sequence index) until we reach y=9.\n\nWe must avoid collisions at every turn we are on a freeway (i.e., when y_t is in [1,8]).\n\nWe are allowed to stay at the same row (which may be safe if at that turn no car on that row covers 0) or move to adjacent rows.\n\nBut note: when we move at turn T, we are still on the old row at turn T. Then at turn T+1 we are on the new row.\n\nSo the collision check at turn T is only for the row we are currently on (which is y_T).\n\nWe are given the state at turn 7. We need to compute the positions of the cars at any future turn T.\n\nLet T = 7 + t (where t>=0, and t=0 is turn 7).\n\nFor a car on freeway k at turn 7: (head, tail, direction, speed) = (h, tau, d, s). Since all are right-moving, the span at turn 7+t is:\n  [tau + s*t, h + s*t]\n\nWe must check for each freeway we are on at turn T=7+t: is 0 in the span of any car on that freeway at turn T?\n\nWe start at y=5 at turn 7.\n\nWe need to go to y=9. The minimal number of moves if there were no cars: 4 steps up (so H=4, but note we start at turn7 and we do 4 actions: at turn7, turn8, turn9, turn10 -> then at turn10 we are at y=9? Actually, at turn7 we start at y=5. Then:\n\nturn7: action U -> at turn8: y=6\nturn8: action U -> at turn9: y=7\nturn9: action U -> at turn10: y=8\nturn10: action U -> at turn11: y=9 -> then we stop at turn11? But note we require the last action to be at turn (t1+H-1) and then at the end of that turn we are at y=9. So if we do 4 actions (at turns 7,8,9,10) then at turn11 we are at y=9? Actually, the sequence is from t=0 to H-1, meaning we do H actions. After H actions, we have moved H steps? But note:\n\nThe update: at turn T, we do action a_T, then the new position is for turn T+1.\n\nSo:\n  At turn7 (start): y=5.\n  After action at turn7: at turn8 we are at y5 + delta.\n\nWe require that at the turn after the last action (turn t1+H) we are at y=9? Actually, the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" such that after these H actions, the position becomes (0,9). That is, at turn t1+H we are at (0,9).\n\nSo:\n  turn7: we are at y=5.\n  We do actions at turns: 7, 8, ..., 7+H-1.\n  Then at turn 7+H, we are at y=9.\n\nTherefore, we must have moved up 4 times. But we can also move down or stay. However, the minimal H would be at least 4.\n\nBut we must avoid collisions at every turn from turn7 to turn7+H-1? Actually, we must avoid collisions at every turn we are on a freeway. Note that at turn7: we are at y=5 (freeway) and then at each subsequent turn until we leave the freeways (y=0 or y=9) we are vulnerable.\n\nSpecifically, at turn T (>=7) we are at y_T. If y_T is in [1,8], then we must check for collision at that turn.\n\nAt turn7: we are at y=5 -> freeway 5.\n\nAt turn8: we are at the y after the first action, which could be 4,5, or 6 -> and if it's in [1,8] then check.\n\nWe need to simulate the future car positions on each freeway.\n\nFirst, let's note the cars per freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: three cars: \n  c1: (-20, -31, right, 4) -> at turn7: [ -31 + 4*0, -20 + 4*0] = [-31, -20] -> but wait, the representation: for right-moving, at turn7 we have [tau, h] = [-31, -20]? Actually, the problem says the state at turn t1 is given. So at turn7, the car is defined by (head, tail) = (-20, -31). But for a right-moving car, the representation is [tail, head]? Actually, the problem says: for a right-moving car, the span at t1 is [tau, h]. So for this car: tau=-31, h=-20 -> so the span is [-31, -20]. Then at turn T=7+t: [ -31 + 4*t, -20 + 4*t ]\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 1: \n  c2: (16, 5, right, 4) -> [5, 16] at t=0? But wait: the problem says: (head, tail) = (16,5) and it's right-moving -> so the span at t1=7 is [tail, head] = [5,16]. Then at T: [5+4*t, 16+4*t]\n  c3: (52,41,right,4) -> [41,52] at t1=7.\n\nFreeway 2: one car: (12,1,right,12) -> [1,12] at t1=7, then at T: [1+12*t, 12+12*t]\n\nFreeway 3: one car: (-20,-31,right,4) -> same as freeway1 c1: [-31, -20] at t1=7, then at T: [-31+4*t, -20+4*t]\n\nFreeway 4: same as freeway1: three cars: \n  c1: [-31, -20] at t1=7 -> [-31+4*t, -20+4*t]\n  c2: [5,16] at t1=7 -> [5+4*t, 16+4*t]\n  c3: [41,52] at t1=7 -> [41+4*t, 52+4*t]\n\nFreeway 5: same as freeway1: three cars.\n\nFreeway 6: same as freeway1: three cars.\n\nFreeway 7: one car: (-20,-31,right,4) -> [-31, -20] at t1=7 -> [-31+4*t, -20+4*t]\n\nFreeway 8: one car: same as freeway7.\n\nNow, we are at turn7 at y=5. We must check freeway5 at turn7: are there any car spans that contain 0?\n\nAt freeway5, turn7 (t=0):\n  Car1: [-31, -20] -> 0 is not in this interval? (since -20 < 0? Actually, -20 is negative, so 0 is not between -31 and -20? Actually, -31 <= 0 <= -20? -> no, because -20 is less than 0? Actually, no: -20 < 0, and the interval is from -31 to -20, so 0 is not in between. So safe for car1.\n\n  Car2: [5,16] -> 0 not in [5,16] -> safe.\n\n  Car3: [41,52] -> 0 not in [41,52] -> safe.\n\nSo at turn7, we are safe.\n\nNow, we plan to move up. But we must check the next turns.\n\nWe are going to simulate the minimal path: we try to go up as fast as possible and see if we can avoid collisions.\n\nOption 1: always go up (4 times). Then:\n\nTurn7: at y=5 -> safe as above.\nAction: U -> then at turn8: y=6.\n\nTurn8: at y=6. Check freeway6 at turn8 (t=1, because from turn7 to turn8: t=1).\n\nFreeway6 at turn8 (t=1):\n  Car1: [-31+4*1, -20+4*1] = [-27, -16] -> 0 not in [-27,-16] -> safe.\n  Car2: [5+4*1, 16+4*1] = [9,20] -> 0 not in [9,20] -> safe.\n  Car3: [41+4*1,52+4*1] = [45,56] -> safe.\n\nAction: U -> at turn9: y=7.\n\nTurn9: at y=7 (freeway7). Check at turn9 (t=2: because from turn7 to turn9: 2 turns passed).\n\nFreeway7: one car: \n  [-31+4*2, -20+4*2] = [-31+8, -20+8] = [-23, -12] -> safe.\n\nAction: U -> at turn10: y=8.\n\nTurn10: at y=8 (freeway8). Check at turn10 (t=3).\n\nFreeway8: one car: [-31+4*3, -20+4*3] = [-31+12, -20+12] = [-19,-8] -> safe.\n\nAction: U -> at turn11: y=9 -> goal.\n\nSo we can do 4 consecutive U moves and be safe? Then H=4, and the actions at turns 7,8,9,10 are U.\n\nBut wait: what about freeway2? We never went to freeway2. And freeway3 and freeway4 and freeway5 we only were at turn7 on freeway5 and then moved to 6,7,8. So we didn't need to check freeway2,3,4, etc. because we were not on them at those turns.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\n\nThen at turn11 we are at y=9.\n\nBut let me double-check freeway5 at turn7: we already did.\n\nfreeway6 at turn8: \n  car1: [-27,-16] -> doesn't cover 0? Correct.\n  car2: [9,20] -> doesn't cover 0? Correct.\n\nfreeway7 at turn9: [-23,-12] -> doesn't cover 0? Correct.\n\nfreeway8 at turn10: [-19,-8] -> doesn't cover 0? Correct.\n\nSo it seems safe.\n\nBut why is freeway2 present? It has a car (12,1,right,12) -> at turn7: [1,12] -> but we are not on freeway2 at any turn? So we don't care.\n\nHowever, note that if we had to stay on a row that has a car covering 0, we would have to avoid.\n\nBut in this case, we are moving through without staying.\n\nBut wait: what about the car on freeway2? It moves at 12 per turn. At turn7: [1,12] -> at turn8: [1+12,12+12]=[13,24] -> safe. At turn7: if we had been on freeway2, we would have been hit? But we weren't.\n\nSo the sequence is safe.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 4.\n\nBut the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and note that H is the number of actions. We have 4 actions.\n\nBut let me check if we can do it in less? 4 moves up is the minimum because 5 to 9 requires 4 moves. So no.\n\nBut what about if we go up faster? We can only go one step at a time.\n\nSo the answer should be:\n\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\n\nBut wait: the answer format:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 7: a_{7}\nTurn 8: a_{8}\nTurn 9: a_{9}\nTurn 10: a_{10}\n}\n\nBut note: the problem says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\". So t from 0 to 3 (H=4) gives:\n\nt=0: turn7 -> a7\nt=1: turn8 -> a8\nt=2: turn9 -> a9\nt=3: turn10 -> a10\n\nSo yes.\n\nBut let me check if at any point we are on a freeway that has a car covering 0 at that turn? We did, and we found none.\n\nBut wait: what about freeway5 at turn7? We are at y=5 and turn7: freeway5 has cars that do not cover 0.\n\nBut what about freeway6 at turn8: we have car2: [9,20] at turn8? 0 is not in [9,20] -> safe.\n\nBut wait: the car on freeway2: at turn7 is at [1,12] -> which does cover 0? Actually, [1,12] includes 0? No, because 1 to 12: 0 is less than 1. So it does not include 0.\n\nSimilarly, at turn8: freeway2 car: [13,24] -> no.\n\nSo the plan is safe.\n\nBut why was freeway2 mentioned? Maybe to distract? Or maybe if we had to use freeway2? But we didn't.\n\nSo I think the minimal sequence is 4 moves up.\n\nBut let me consider if we had to wait? For example, if at some point a car was coming, we might have to wait. But in this case, we don't.\n\nBut wait: what about freeway5 at turn7: we have a car at [5,16] at turn7? That is, from 5 to 16. But the player is at x=0, which is not in [5,16]? So safe.\n\nSimilarly, at turn8: freeway6: car2 is at [9,20] -> 0 is not in [9,20].\n\nBut note: at turn7, freeway5 car2 is at [5,16] -> which does not include 0? Correct.\n\nBut what if we had stayed at freeway5 at turn8? Then we would be at y=5 at turn8. Then we would check freeway5 at turn8 (t=1):\n\n  Car1: [-31+4, -20+4] = [-27,-16] -> safe.\n  Car2: [5+4, 16+4] = [9,20] -> safe.\n  Car3: [41+4,52+4] = [45,56] -> safe.\n\nSo even if we stayed, it would be safe? But we don't need to.\n\nSo the minimal is 4.\n\nBut the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and we have H=4.\n\nBut note: the goal is to reach (0,9) and we do so at turn11. The number of actions is 4.\n\nBut the problem does not require the time to be minimal? It says \"minimal number of turns H\" and H is the number of actions? Actually, the problem says: \"the minimal number of turns H\" and then the sequence of H actions. So H is the length of the sequence.\n\nAnd we have H=4.\n\nBut let me check if we can do it in 3? That would require moving from 5 to 9 in 3 moves: but 5+3=8, not 9. So impossible. So 4 is minimal.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\n}\n\nBut wait: the problem says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" and so on. So we write:\n\nTurn 7: a_{7} -> U\nTurn 8: a_{8} -> U\nTurn 9: a_{9} -> U\nTurn 10: a_{10} -> U\n\nBut note: the answer format says to write the actions for each turn starting at t1 and then t1+1, etc.\n\nSo:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\n}\n\nBut to be precise, I should write the actions as per the format.\n\nHowever, the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\". So we have:\n\nt=0: turn7 -> a7 = U\nt=1: turn8 -> a8 = U\nt=2: turn9 -> a9 = U\nt=3: turn10 -> a10 = U\n\nSo the boxed answer should list these four turns.\n\nBut the problem also says: \"determine the minimal number of turns H\", but the answer format only shows the sequence. So we output the sequence and H is implied (4).\n\nSo I think we are done.\n\nBut wait: what about the car on freeway2? At turn7, it is at [1,12] -> which does not include 0? Because 0 < 1. But what if we were on freeway2 at turn7? We are not, so safe.\n\nBut note: at turn7, we are at y=5, so freeway5.\n\nBut what if we moved down? Then we might hit freeway4? But we are going up.\n\nSo I think it's safe.\n\nBut let me check freeway5 at turn7 again: the car2 is [5,16] -> which means the car occupies from 5 to 16. The player is at 0. So no collision.\n\nBut what if we had to cross freeway2? We don't.\n\nSo the answer is as above.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 5)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 7\\) is 4. The sequence of actions is:\n\n- At turn 7, move up (U) to position \\(y = 6\\) at turn 8.\n- At turn 8, move up (U) to position \\(y = 7\\) at turn 9.\n- At turn 9, move up (U) to position \\(y = 8\\) at turn 10.\n- At turn 10, move up (U) to position \\(y = 9\\) at turn 11.\n\nThis sequence avoids collisions with all cars on the freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) at each turn:\n\n- **Turn 7 (y=5)**: Cars on freeway 5 are at spans \\([-31, -20]\\), \\([5, 16]\\), and \\([41, 52]\\). Position \\(x=0\\) is not in any span.\n- **Turn 8 (y=6)**: Cars on freeway 6 are at spans \\([-27, -16]\\), \\([9, 20]\\), and \\([45, 56]\\). Position \\(x=0\\) is not in any span.\n- **Turn 9 (y=7)**: Cars on freeway 7 are at span \\([-23, -12]\\). Position \\(x=0\\) is not in the span.\n- **Turn 10 (y=8)**: Cars on freeway 8 are at span \\([-19, -8]\\). Position \\(x=0\\) is not in the span.\n\nThus, the sequence is safe and reaches the goal in the minimal number of turns.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 7: U \\\\\nTurn 8: U \\\\\nTurn 9: U \\\\\nTurn 10: U\n}",

We need to get to (0,9) in minimal turns H, avoiding collisions.\n\nImportant note: \n- Collision occurs at turn T only if the player is on freeway y_T and at that turn T, there is a car on that freeway such that 0 (the x-coordinate of the player) is in the car's span at turn T.\n\n- When moving from y to y' at turn T, note that at the moment of turn T, the player is still on y (so we check for collision on freeway y at turn T). Then after the move, at turn T+1, the player will be on y'. So we don't check the destination freeway at turn T.\n\nThe goal is to get to (0,9). Note that (0,9) is the top row, and there are no cars above it (since cars are only on freeways 1 to 8). So once we are at (0,9), we are safe.\n\nWe start at (0,6) at turn 8. We need to plan actions for turns 8, 9, 10, ... until we reach 9.\n\nWe have 8 freeways (y=1 to 8). Each freeway has cars that move either left or right at a constant speed. The car state is given at turn t1=8.\n\nLet me write down the car spans at turn t1=8 for each freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: \n  Car1: head=-16, tail=-27, direction=right, speed=4 -> This car is moving right, so the span is [tau, h] = [-27, -16] (since tail is the leftmost and head is the rightmost when moving right). \n  But note: the update rule for right-moving: at turn T, span = [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n  Similarly, car2: (20,9,right,4) -> [9,20] at t1? Actually, the representation is (head, tail, direction, speed). \n  For a right-moving car, the head is the rightmost and tail is the leftmost? The update rule says: \n    Right-moving: [tau, h] at t1 becomes [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n  But note the given data: \n      Car1: head=-16, tail=-27 -> so at t1, the car spans from -27 (tail) to -16 (head). \n      Car2: head=20, tail=9 -> so at t1, the car spans from 9 to 20.\n      Car3: head=56, tail=45 -> from 45 to 56.\n\nFreeway 2: \n  Only one car: (24,13,right,12) -> so [13,24] at t1.\n\nFreeway 3: \n  Only one car: (-16,-27,right,4) -> [-27,-16] at t1.\n\nFreeway 4: same as freeway1: three cars: [-27,-16], [9,20], [45,56] at t1.\n\nFreeway 5: same as freeway1.\n\nFreeway 6: same as freeway1.\n\nFreeway 7: one car: (-16,-27,right,4) -> [-27,-16] at t1.\n\nFreeway 8: one car: (-16,-27,right,4) -> [-27,-16] at t1.\n\nWe are starting at y=6 at turn 8. We can move U (up to y=7), D (down to y=5), or S (stay at y=6).\n\nWe need to avoid collisions when we are on a freeway. Specifically, when we are on freeway k at turn T, we require that at that turn T, there is no car on freeway k such that 0 is in the car's span at turn T.\n\nWe are going to simulate the movement and the car positions over time (turns). We want the minimal H.\n\nNote: The car positions are functions of time (relative to t1). For a car at freeway k, at time T (global turn), the span is:\n\n  If right-moving: [tau + s*(T - t1), h + s*(T - t1)]\n  If left-moving: [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut note: all cars in this problem are right-moving. So we only use the right-moving formula.\n\nSo for a car given by (h, tau, d, s) at t1, at time T (>=t1) the span is:\n   [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nWe are at turn 8, so let t = T - t1, then at time t (steps after t1) the car's span is:\n   [tau + s*t, h + s*t]\n\nWe are at freeway k at turn T (which is t1+t) and we require that 0 is not in the span of any car on that freeway at that turn.\n\nLet me write a function to check for a given freeway k and time t (relative to t1, so turn = t1+t) whether the freeway k is safe at that turn.\n\nBut note: we start at t=0 (turn t1=8) and we are at y=6. We need to check y=6 at turn 8? \n  Actually, at the start of turn 8, we are at (0,6). We are about to take an action. But the collision condition is: at turn T, if we are on freeway k, then we check for collision on that freeway at that turn.\n\nSo at the very turn we are on a freeway, we must avoid the cars at that turn.\n\nTherefore, at turn 8 (t=0) we are on freeway 6. We must check if freeway 6 at t=0 is safe.\n\nFreeway 6 at t=0: \n  Three cars: \n    car1: tau=-27, h=-16, s=4 -> span = [-27, -16] -> 0 is not in [-27,-16] -> safe for this car.\n    car2: tau=9, h=20, s=4 -> [9,20] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n    car3: tau=45, h=56, s=4 -> [45,56] -> safe.\n\nSo freeway6 at t=0 is safe.\n\nNow, we can choose an action: U, D, or S.\n\nOur goal is to get to y=9 as quickly as possible. We are at y=6, so we need to go up 3 steps. But we cannot go up blindly because we have to avoid the freeways at the time we are on them.\n\nWe are going to try to find the minimal H by simulating possible moves. Since we want minimal H, we try to go up as much as possible, but we must avoid collisions.\n\nLet me denote:\n  t: the number of steps after t1 (so at step t, the global turn is t1+t)\n\nWe are at y(t) at step t (after t actions, starting at t=0: y(0)=6).\n\nWe have to plan actions a_{t1+t} for t=0,1,2,... until we reach 9.\n\nWe are constrained by:\n  y(t+1) = y(t) + delta, where delta = +1 (U), -1 (D), 0 (S), and y(t+1) must be in [0,9].\n\nWe require that at each step t (global turn t1+t), we are on freeway y(t) (if y(t) is between 1 and 8) and we must check that freeway at that turn is safe.\n\nNote: when y(t)=0 or y(t)=9, there are no cars (freeways are 1-8). So we don't need to check for cars.\n\nBut note: we start at y(0)=6, and we are at turn 8 (t=0). We are safe at turn8 on freeway6.\n\nNow, let's try to go up as quickly as possible.\n\nOption 1: Go up three times: \n  t0 (t=0): at y=6 -> safe as above.\n  Action at t=0: U -> then at turn 9 (t=1) we are at y=7.\n      We must check freeway7 at turn9 (t=1 relative to t1=8: so t=1).\n      Freeway7 has one car: (-16,-27,right,4) -> at t=1: \n          span = [tau + s*1, h + s*1] = [-27+4, -16+4] = [-23, -12] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\n  Action at t=1: U -> then at turn10 (t=2) we are at y=8.\n      Check freeway8 at turn10 (t=2):\n          car: [-27+4*2, -16+4*2] = [-27+8, -16+8] = [-19, -8] -> safe.\n\n  Action at t=2: U -> then at turn11 (t=3) we are at y=9 -> goal.\n\nSo we have a sequence: U, U, U. H=3.\n\nBut wait, we must check every step: at each turn we are on a freeway, we check that freeway at that turn.\n\nWe did:\n  Turn8 (t=0): y=6 -> safe (as above).\n  Turn9 (t=1): y=7 -> safe (freeway7 at t=1: [-23,-12] -> safe).\n  Turn10 (t=2): y=8 -> safe (freeway8 at t=2: [-19,-8] -> safe).\n  Then at turn11 (t=3): we are at y=9 -> goal.\n\nSo H=3.\n\nBut let me check if there are any cars that might be a problem? \n\nWhat about the other freeways? We only care about the freeway we are on at that turn.\n\nBut wait, what about freeway6 at turn9? We are not on freeway6 at turn9, so we don't care. Similarly, we don't care about freeway7 at turn8 or turn10? We only check the freeway we are on at that turn.\n\nSo the above sequence seems safe.\n\nBut let me double-check the car on freeway8 at t=2: \n  The car is initially at [-27,-16] at t1=8 (t=0). At t=2 (turn10), it moves right by 4*2=8, so [-27+8, -16+8] = [-19,-8] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway7 at t=1: [-27+4, -16+4] = [-23,-12] -> safe.\n\nBut what about freeway6? We are only on freeway6 at turn8 (t=0). At turn8, the cars on freeway6 are:\n  [-27,-16], [9,20], [45,56] -> none contains 0.\n\nSo the sequence: \n  Turn8: U\n  Turn9: U\n  Turn10: U\n\nBut wait: after the first U at turn8, we are at y=7 at turn9. Then after the second U at turn9, we are at y=8 at turn10. Then after the third U at turn10, we are at y=9 at turn11. So we are at y=9 at turn11, which is the goal.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"reach (0,9)\" and we are at (0,9) at turn11. We don't need to stay there? We just need to be there at some turn.\n\nSo H=3 turns? But let me count the actions: we take 3 actions: at turns 8,9,10. Then at turn11 we are at 9.\n\nBut the problem says: a sequence of actions for t from 0 to H-1, and then we are at 9 at turn t1+H-1? \n\nWait: the sequence is for t=0 to H-1, meaning we take H actions. Then the state after H actions is at time t1+H. So we are at y at turn t1+H.\n\nBut the goal is to have y_{t1+H-1} = 9? \n\nLet me read: \n  \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and then \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\".\n\nNote: \n  t = 0: action at t1+0 -> turn t1\n  t = 1: action at t1+1\n  ...\n  t = H-1: action at t1+H-1\n\nThen the state after the last action is at turn t1+H. But the condition is that at turn t1+H-1 (after H-1 actions) we are at 9? \n\nWait, let's see the update: \n  After action at turn t, the next state is at turn t+1.\n\nSo if we take an action at turn t1, then at turn t1+1 we are at y1 = y0 + delta.\nSimilarly, if we take an action at turn t1+H-1, then at turn t1+H we are at y_{t1+H}.\n\nBut the condition is: we want y_{t1+H-1} = 9? That doesn't seem right because we are at y_{t1+H-1} at the beginning of turn t1+H-1? And then we take an action at that turn which moves us to turn t1+H.\n\nActually, the state y_t is at the beginning of turn t? Or after the action? \n\nThe problem states: \n  \"y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t\"\n\nSo at the start of turn t, the player is at y_t. Then we choose an action a_t, and then we move to y_{t+1} at the start of turn t+1.\n\nTherefore, the condition is: we want at the start of turn t1+H, we are at y_{t1+H} = 9? \n\nBut the problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\". \n\nLet me read the problem again: \n  \"minimizes H such that y_{t1+H-1} = 9\"\n\nAnd the sequence is for t=0 to H-1: actions at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\nAfter the last action (at turn t1+H-1), the state becomes y_{t1+H} = y_{t1+H-1} + delta_{t1+H-1}.\n\nBut we want y_{t1+H-1} = 9? Then we are at 9 at the start of turn t1+H-1. Then we take an action at that turn? That action would then move us to y_{t1+H} which might be 8,9, or 10? But 10 is invalid.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might mean that at the start of turn t1+H-1 we are at 9, and then we don't necessarily take an action? But the sequence of actions is for t=0 to H-1, so we take H actions. The last action is at turn t1+H-1, and then we end at y_{t1+H} = 9? \n\nBut the condition says y_{t1+H-1}=9. \n\nThis is ambiguous. Let me see the problem:\n\n  \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0, 9)\"\n\nand then \"such that y_{t1+H-1} = 9\"\n\nBut note: the state after the last action is at turn t1+H. So to have the player at (0,9) at the start of turn t1+H, then we require that the action at turn t1+H-1 leads to y_{t1+H}=9.\n\nTherefore, we require y_{t1+H}=9.\n\nBut the problem says y_{t1+H-1}=9. \n\nLet me check the problem statement again: \n  \"minimizes H such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\"\n\nBut if we are at y_{t1+H-1}=9 at the start of turn t1+H-1, then we are already at 9. Then we don't need to take an action? But the sequence includes an action at turn t1+H-1? That action might move us away.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem means that after H-1 actions we are at 9? \n\nBut the sequence is defined for t=0 to H-1, so we take H actions. \n\nI think there might be an off-by-one. Let me clarify with an example:\n\nSuppose we are at y=6 at turn8. If we do nothing (S), then we are still at 6 at turn9. But we want to get to 9.\n\nIf we take an action U at turn8, then at turn9 we are at 7.\n\nSo to be at 9 at turn T, we must have taken an action at turn T-1 that moves us from 8 to 9? \n\nBut the condition in the problem is: we want y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nSo if we set H=1, then we want y_{8}=9? But we start at 6 -> not 9.\n\nH=2: we want y_{9}=9? \n  At turn8 we take an action a8. Then y9 = y8 + delta8. \n  We start at y8=6. Then y9 = 6 + delta. To get 9, we would need delta=3 -> not possible.\n\nH=3: we want y_{10}=9?\n  Then at turn8: a8 -> y9 = 6+delta8\n  turn9: a9 -> y10 = y9 + delta9\n  We require y10=9.\n\nBut the problem says we want y_{t1+H-1}=9, which for H=3 is y_{8+3-1}=y_{10}=9 -> so that matches.\n\nSo the goal is: at the start of turn t1+H, we are at y_{t1+H}=9? \n\nBut the condition says y_{t1+H-1}=9? \n\nWait, no: \n  We want y_{t1+H-1} = 9.\n\nBut in the example above, for H=3, we want y_{10}=9? But the state y10 is the state at the start of turn10. \n\nBut in the update, after the action at turn9, we get y10. \n\nSo if we take actions at turn8 and turn9 (two actions, H=2) we get y10? \n\nBut then the condition for H=2 would be: we want y_{8+2-1}=y9=9. \n\nBut if we take two actions: \n  Action at turn8: we go from y8=6 to y9=?\n  Action at turn9: we go from y9 to y10.\n\nWe want y9=9? Then we must have gone from 6 to 9 in one action? Impossible.\n\nTherefore, the condition must be: we want the state at the start of turn t1+H to be 9, which is y_{t1+H}=9.\n\nBut the problem says: y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nI think there is a mistake in the problem. \n\nLooking back: \n  \"minimizes H such that y_{t1+H-1} = 9\"\n\nBut in the example, if we are at y8=6 and we want to get to 9, we need at least 3 steps? \n\nWait, no: \n  We are at turn8: we start at y8=6. \n  We take an action at turn8: then at turn9 we are at y9 = 6 + delta.\n  We take an action at turn9: then at turn10 we are at y10 = y9 + delta.\n  We take an action at turn10: then at turn11 we are at y11 = y10 + delta.\n\nWe want y_{t1+H-1} = 9.\n\nFor H=3: we want y_{8+3-1}=y10=9.\n\nSo we need to be at 9 at the start of turn10? \n\nThen we have taken two actions: at turn8 and turn9.\n\nAt turn8: action a8 -> y9 = 6 + a8\nAt turn9: action a9 -> y10 = y9 + a9\n\nWe want y10=9.\n\nSo we need to achieve that in two actions? \n\nBut we are at 6 at the start. \n  After turn8: we can be at 5,6,7.\n  Then after turn9: we can be at 4,5,6,7,8 (if we went up then down, etc). \n  We cannot get to 9 in two moves from 6: \n      6 -> 7 -> 8 (max) \n      or 6->7->7 (if we stay) \n      or 6->7->8? \n      But 9? We need two ups: \n          6 -> 7 (action U at turn8) -> then at turn9 we are at 7. Then we do U again -> then at turn10 we are at 8. \n      We cannot get to 9 in two moves? \n\nThree moves: \n  turn8: U -> y9=7\n  turn9: U -> y10=8\n  turn10: U -> y11=9\n\nThen we want y_{8+3-1}=y10=8? not 9.\n\nSo if we take three actions, we get to 9 at turn11, and we want y_{t1+H-1}=y10=9? Then we are not there.\n\nThis suggests the problem might mean: we want to be at 9 at the start of turn t1+H, meaning y_{t1+H}=9.\n\nBut the problem explicitly says: \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\".\n\nAlternatively, the indexing might be: \n  The sequence of actions is taken from t1 to t1+H-1, and the state after the last action is at turn t1+H, and we require that state to be 9? \n\nBut the problem says \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\".\n\nLet me read the problem again: \n  \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0, 9)\"\n\nand then \"such that y_{t1+H-1} = 9\"\n\nI think the confusion is: what is the state after the actions? \n\nThe problem says: \n  Player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t.\n\nSo the action at turn t determines the next state at turn t+1.\n\nTherefore, if we take an action at turn t1, we get y_{t1+1}.\nThen action at turn t1+1: we get y_{t1+2}.\n...\nAction at turn t1+H-1: we get y_{t1+H}.\n\nWe want y_{t1+H} = 9? But the problem says y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nThis is very confusing.\n\nLooking at the answer format: \n  Turn t1: a_{t1}\n  Turn t1+1: a_{t1+1}\n  ...\n\nAnd then we stop after H actions. \n\nAnd then we require that at the end, we are at 9. \n\nBut the condition is y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nPerhaps the state y_t is the state at the beginning of turn t, and then we take an action a_t, and then during turn t we are at y_t, and then we update to y_{t+1} at the beginning of turn t+1.\n\nAnd collision occurs at turn t if we are on freeway y_t at turn t.\n\nThen the goal is to be at y_{t1+H-1}=9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1. \n\nBut then we are at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, and then we take an action at turn t1+H-1? That action will move us to y_{t1+H} = 9 + delta, which might be 8,9, or 10 (invalid) if we move down or up.\n\nBut we want to be at 9, and then we are done? So we don't care what happens after? \n\nThe problem says \"reach (0,9)\", so once we are at 9 at the beginning of a turn, we have reached? \n\nBut then why do we need to take an action at that turn? \n\nThe sequence of actions is for turns t1 to t1+H-1. So if we are at 9 at turn t1+H-1, then we are done at the beginning of that turn, but then we still take an action? \n\nThis is messy.\n\nLet me assume that the condition is to have the player at 9 at the beginning of a turn, and we don't necessarily have to take an action after that? \n\nBut the sequence is defined for H actions. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps H is the number of turns we take actions until we are at 9. \n\nBut the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\" and then the sequence has H actions.\n\nAnd then the condition is: after these H actions, we are at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H? \n\nBut the condition says y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nI think there might be a typo. In many similar problems, the state after the last action is at turn t1+H, and we require y_{t1+H}=9.\n\nGiven the confusion, let me try to see what the minimal H is for both interpretations.\n\nInterpretation 1: we require y_{t1+H}=9.\n  We start at y8=6.\n  We want to get to y_{8+H}=9.\n  The minimal number of moves: we need to go up 3 times, so at least 3 actions.\n  So H=3: \n      turn8: U -> y9=7\n      turn9: U -> y10=8\n      turn10: U -> y11=9 -> so at turn11 (which is t1+3) we are at 9.\n  So H=3.\n\nInterpretation 2: we require y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n  We start at y8=6.\n  We want y_{8+H-1}=9.\n  For H=3: we want y_{10}=9.\n  How to achieve y10=9?\n      turn8: action a8 -> y9 = 6 + a8\n      turn9: action a9 -> y10 = y9 + a9\n      We want y10=9.\n      So we need to go from 6 to 7 at turn8 (a8=U), then from 7 to 9? But we can only move by ±1 or 0. \n      We cannot jump from 7 to 9 in one move.\n  H=4: we want y_{11}=9.\n      turn8: a8 -> y9 = 6 + a8\n      turn9: a9 -> y10 = y9 + a9\n      turn10: a10 -> y11 = y10 + a10\n      We want y11=9.\n      We can do: \n          turn8: U -> y9=7\n          turn9: U -> y10=8\n          turn10: U -> y11=9 -> works.\n\n  But then H=4.\n\nBut in the first interpretation, we can do it in H=3.\n\nThe problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", so we prefer smaller H.\n\nBut the condition explicitly says y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nLet me read the problem again: \n  \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0, 9)\"\n\nand then \"such that y_{t1+H-1} = 9\"\n\nAnd also, the collision avoidance is only during the turns we are on the freeways.\n\nGiven that, if we are at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, then during that turn we are at 9, which is not a freeway (freeways are 1-8), so no collision check. Then we take an action at turn t1+H-1, but that action might move us away, but we don't care because the goal is already achieved at the beginning of the turn.\n\nBut the goal is to reach (0,9), and we are there at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, so we have reached. The action at that turn is not necessary? But the sequence requires H actions, and the last action is at turn t1+H-1.\n\nThis is inconsistent.\n\nPerhaps the action at turn t1+H-1 is not taken if we are already at 9? But the sequence includes it.\n\nI think the safest is to follow the condition as stated: we require y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nTherefore, we must be at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1.\n\nThen, we need to plan actions for turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-2 to get to y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nBut the sequence has H actions: from turn t1 to turn t1+H-1.\n\nAnd at each turn we take an action, including at turn t1+H-1 even though we are already at 9? \n\nBut then the action at turn t1+H-1 will change our position.\n\nUnless we do S (stay) at turn t1+H-1.\n\nSo if we are at 9 at turn t1+H-1, then we can do action S to stay at 9.\n\nSo for example, to be at 9 at turn10 (t1=8, so turn10 = 8+2, so H-1=2 -> H=3), then we can do:\n  turn8: U -> y9=7\n  turn9: U -> y10=8\n  turn10: U -> y11=9   [but then at turn10 (beginning) we are at 8, not 9]\n\nAlternatively, to have y10=9, we need:\n  y10 = y9 + a9 = 9.\n  y9 = y8 + a8 = ... \n\nBut we start at y8=6. \n  a8: U -> y9=7\n  a9: ? -> we need y10=9 -> requires a9=+2, which is not allowed.\n\nSo we cannot have y10=9.\n\nNext: y11=9 at the beginning of turn11, which is t1+3, so H-1=3 -> H=4.\n\nThen we can do:\n  turn8: U -> y9=7\n  turn9: U -> y10=8\n  turn10: U -> y11=9\n\nThen at turn11 (beginning) we are at 9. So we set H=4, and we take actions at turns 8,9,10,11? But then the last action (at turn11) would be after we are already at 9? \n\nBut the condition is that at the beginning of turn11 we are at 9, so we have reached. Then we take an action at turn11? But we are at 9, and we might move to 10, which is invalid, or to 8, or stay.\n\nBut the problem says we only need to reach (0,9), so once we are there at the beginning of turn11, we are done. However, the sequence requires an action at turn11.\n\nSo we can do S at turn11 to stay at 9.\n\nTherefore, the sequence would be:\n  turn8: U\n  turn9: U\n  turn10: U\n  turn11: S\n\nBut then H=4.\n\nBut is there a way to be at 9 at an earlier turn? \n\nLet me see if we can be at 9 at turn9 or turn10.\n\n turn9: y9=9? \n   y9 = y8 + a8 = 6 + a8. \n   a8 can be U -> 7, D->5, S->6. None gives 9.\n\n turn10: y10=9?\n   y10 = y9 + a9 = (6+a8) + a9.\n   a8 and a9 are in {U,D,S} -> the maximum we can get is 6+1+1=8.\n\n turn11: y11=9 -> possible, as above.\n\n turn12: also possible, but later.\n\nSo minimal H such that y_{8+H-1}=9 is for H=4: y_{8+4-1}=y11=9.\n\nTherefore, we need 4 actions: at turns 8,9,10,11.\n\nBut in this case, we are at freeways during turns 8,9,10, and at turn11 we are at 9 (safe).\n\nWe must avoid collisions on freeways at turns 8,9,10.\n\nWe already know turn8 at freeway6 is safe.\n\nFor turn9 (t=1 relative to t1=8): we are at y9. \n  How do we get to y9? \n  We do U at turn8 -> y9=7.\n\n  Check freeway7 at turn9 (t=1): \n      car: initially [-27,-16] -> at t=1: [-27+4, -16+4] = [-23,-12] -> safe.\n\nFor turn10 (t=2): we are at y10. \n  We do U at turn9 -> y10=8.\n\n  Check freeway8 at turn10 (t=2): \n      car: initially [-27,-16] -> at t=2: [-27+8, -16+8] = [-19,-8] -> safe.\n\nThen at turn11, we are at 9, and we do S.\n\nSo the sequence is:\n  Turn8: U\n  Turn9: U\n  Turn10: U\n  Turn11: S\n\nBut wait, the last action is at turn11, which is t1+3, and we are done at turn11. \n\nBut the problem requires the sequence to have H=4 actions, from turn8 to turn11.\n\nBut is there a shorter sequence? We saw that we cannot get to 9 before turn11.\n\nBut what if we do more moves in the same number of turns? For example, can we get to 9 at turn11 with H=4 but without three ups? We did three ups and then a stay.\n\nBut we must avoid collisions. Is there a way to get to 9 earlier? No.\n\nBut wait, what if we go down first? That would take more turns.\n\nSo the minimal H is 4.\n\nBut earlier I thought we could do it in 3 actions for the other interpretation. \n\nGiven the problem explicitly says y_{t1+H-1}=9, we must use H=4.\n\nBut let me confirm with the car movements. \n\nIn the sequence above, we are safe at every step.\n\nHowever, I see that freeway7 at turn9 is safe, freeway8 at turn10 is safe.\n\nBut what about the other freeways? We are only on freeway7 at turn9 and freeway8 at turn10, and freeway6 at turn8. We are not on other freeways.\n\nSo it works.\n\nBut is there a sequence with H=3? \n  We want y_{8+3-1}=y10=9. \n  But we cannot achieve y10=9 from y8=6 in two actions: maximum is 6+1+1=8.\n\nSo H=4 is minimal.\n\nBut let me check if we can be at 9 at turn11 with only three actions? \n  If we take only three actions: at turns8,9,10, then we would have:\n      y9 = 6 + a8\n      y10 = y9 + a9\n      y11 = y10 + a10\n  We want y11=9, but for H=3 the condition is y_{8+3-1}=y10=9, which we don't care about in this interpretation. But the problem requires y_{t1+H-1}=9, so for H=3 we require y10=9, which we cannot achieve.\n\nTherefore, we must have H=4.\n\nBut wait, the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\", and then the sequence has H actions. And we require that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 we are at 9.\n\nSo we need to be at 9 at turn11 (for H=4: 8+4-1=11).\n\nSo the answer should be 4 actions.\n\nBut let me see if we can get to 9 earlier by a different route. For example, if we go down and then up? That would take more turns.\n\nOr if we wait? \n\nFor example, if we do:\n  turn8: S -> y9=6\n  turn9: U -> y10=7\n  turn10: U -> y11=8\n  turn11: U -> y12=9\n\nThen we are at 9 at turn12. For H=5: we require y_{8+5-1}=y12=9. \n  So H=5.\n\nWorse.\n\nOr if we do:\n  turn8: U -> y9=7\n  turn9: S -> y10=7\n  turn10: U -> y11=8\n  turn11: U -> y12=9 -> H=5.\n\nStill worse.\n\nSo the minimal H is 4.\n\nBut is there a sequence that gets us to 9 at an earlier turn? For example, turn11 is the earliest we can be at 9.\n\nTherefore, we choose H=4.\n\nBut let me re-check the car positions for the sequence:\n\n  Turn8: at y=6 (freeway6) -> check at turn8 (t=0): \n        freeway6 cars: \n          car1: [-27, -16] -> at t=0: [-27, -16] -> safe.\n          car2: [9,20] -> safe.\n          car3: [45,56] -> safe.\n\n  Action: U\n\n  Turn9: we are at y=7 (freeway7) -> check at turn9 (t=1): \n        freeway7: one car: [-27+4*1, -16+4*1] = [-23,-12] -> safe.\n\n  Action: U\n\n  Turn10: we are at y=8 (freeway8) -> check at turn10 (t=2): \n        freeway8: one car: [-27+4*2, -16+4*2] = [-19,-8] -> safe.\n\n  Action: U\n\n  Turn11: we are at y=9 (not a freeway) -> no collision check.\n  But we are required to take an action at turn11? And we want to be at 9 at the beginning of turn11, so we are already at 9. Then we do S to stay.\n\n  Action: S\n\nSo the sequence is U, U, U, S.\n\nBut wait, after the third U (at turn10), we move to y11=9. Then at turn11, we are at 9, and we do S -> then y12=9, but the goal is to be at 9 at turn11 (which we are), and then we take an action but that doesn't affect the goal.\n\nThe problem only requires that at turn t1+H-1 = 8+4-1 = 11, we are at 9. We are at 9 at the beginning of turn11, so condition satisfied.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: S\n\nBut is there a possibility that at some turn we are not safe? \n\nWhat about the car on freeway2? We never go to freeway2, so it doesn't matter.\n\nSimilarly, freeway3,4,5: we are only on freeways 6,7,8.\n\nBut freeway4 and freeway5 have cars, but we are not on them at any turn.\n\nSo it is safe.\n\nBut wait, what if we could do it in H=4 but with a different sequence that avoids potential future collisions? But in this sequence, we are safe.\n\nBut let me check freeway7 at turn9: \n  We have a car at [-23,-12] -> safe.\n\nBut is there another car on freeway7? The table says freeway7 has only one car.\n\nSimilarly, freeway8: one car.\n\nBut freeway6 at turn8: three cars, all safe.\n\nSo we are good.\n\nBut earlier I thought about freeway2 having a car at (24,13,right,12). At turn8 (t=0): [13,24]. At turn9: [13+12, 24+12] = [25,36] -> safe. At turn10: [37,48] -> safe. We are not on freeway2, so it doesn't matter.\n\nSo the minimal H is 4.\n\nBut let me see if we can do it in H=4 but without the last S? \n\nThe sequence has to have 4 actions. We must provide an action for turn11.\n\nAnd since we are at 9, we can only do S or D. But if we do D, we go to 8, which is not desired. But the goal is already achieved at the beginning of turn11, so we can do S to remain.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: S\n}\n\nBut the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and we have H=4.\n\nBut is there a sequence with H=4 that gets us to 9 at turn11 and we do not need to do the last S? \n\nNo, because the sequence must have exactly H=4 actions.\n\nTherefore, we include the S.\n\nBut note: after the action at turn11 (S), we are at y12=9, which is fine, but we only care about being at 9 at turn11.\n\nSo this is acceptable.\n\nPerhaps we can avoid the last action by being at 9 earlier and then not taking an action? But the problem requires exactly H actions.\n\nSo we output the above.\n\nBut let me double-check if there is a sequence with H=3. \n  For H=3, we require y_{8+3-1}=y10=9.\n  How to achieve that?\n      y10 = y9 + a9 = 9.\n      y9 = y8 + a8 = 6 + a8.\n      So 6 + a8 + a9 = 9.\n      a8 and a9 are in { -1,0,1 }.\n      So a8+a9=3 -> impossible since max is 2.\n\n  Therefore, H=3 is impossible.\n\nSo minimal H=4.\n\nThus, the answer is the sequence above.\n</think>\nThe goal is to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 6)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 8\\) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\), avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\).

The cars are on freeways y=1 to y=8, and they move right or left with given speeds. Collision happens if at turn T, I'm on a freeway y, and for some car on that freeway, 0 is in its span at that turn.\n\nFirst, since I start at y=7 and need to go to y=9, I probably need to move up twice. But I have to avoid the cars on y=7 and y=8 when I'm there.\n\nLet me denote the current turn as t=0 for simplicity, so t1=9, but since all calculations are relative, I'll set t=0 at the start.\n\nSo at turn 0 (which is t1=9), I'm at y=7.\n\nI need to find actions a_t for t=0,1,2,... up to H-1 such that y_H-1 = 9.\n\ny_t is my position at turn t, after action a_t.\n\nThe player update is: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, where Δy_t depends on a_t: U for +1, D for -1, S for 0.\n\nAnd y_t must be integer between 0 and 9 inclusive.\n\nNow, collision: at turn T, if I'm on freeway y_T, and for some car on that freeway, 0 is in its span at turn T.\n\nImportant note: when I move to a new freeway, at turn T, if I move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T, I am not on y_{T+1} at turn T, so I don't collide with cars on y_{T+1} at turn T. I only care about the cars on the freeway I'm currently on at that turn.\n\nAlso, for a car, its span at time T is given by moving from initial position at t1 (t=0).\n\nFor each car, at t=0, we have head, tail, direction, speed.\n\nDirection: right or left.\n\nIn the car update:\n\nLeft-moving: span at T is [h - s(T - t1), τ - s(T - t1)] but t1 is fixed, and T is absolute.\n\nSince t1=9, but I'll use relative time.\n\nSet t=0 as current turn, so t1=9, then at time T from t=0, T is the turn number.\n\nAt turn t (relative to start), which is absolute turn t1 + t.\n\nBut for car positions, we care about the absolute turn.\n\nDefine: let τ be the absolute turn number.\n\nAt τ = t1 = 9, initial state.\n\nThen at absolute turn τ, for a car, if it is left-moving, span is [h - s(τ - t1), τ - s(τ - t1)]? Let's see the notation.\n\nFrom the problem:\n\nFor car on freeway i, at turn t1, head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s.\n\nThen at turn T > t1:\n\nIf left-moving: Span(T) = [h - s(T - t1), τ - s(T - t1)]\n\nBut in the notation, for left-moving, it says Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nSimilarly for right: Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nIn the table, for each car, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nI need to interpret what head and tail mean.\n\nFor left-moving cars, head is the front, which is smaller x if moving left? Let's think.\n\nSuppose a car moving left, so decreasing x.\n\nAt t1, position: if head h and tail τ, and direction left, then since moving left, head should be on the right? I'm confused.\n\nLook at the car update:\n\nFor left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] and it becomes [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT] at T.\n\nIf it's moving left, decreasing x, then at T, the positions decrease, so h - sΔT and τ - sΔT.\n\nBut in the span [h, τ], if it's moving left, and h and τ are positions, which one is larger?\n\nFor example, in freeway 1, there is a car (-12, -23, right, 4). Direction right, so moving right.\n\nFor right-moving, Span(t1) = [τ, h] → [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT]\n\nIn this case, for right-moving, they have [τ, h] with τ and h, and since moving right, τ + sΔT and h + sΔT, so τ should be the left end and h the right end, I think.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, [h, τ] with h - sΔT, τ - sΔT, so if moving left, h should be the right end and τ the left end? Let's see.\n\nIn the left-moving case: Span(t1) = [h, τ] and moves to [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT].\n\nIf moving left, the car is shifting left, so the right end decreases, left end decreases.\n\nSo in [h, τ], if moving left, h should be the right end, τ the left end, so when it moves left, both decrease.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] with moving right, τ is left end, h is right end, so [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT].\n\nIn the notation, for a car, (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nFrom the context, for direction right, head is the front, which is the right end, tail is left end? Let's see the values.\n\nIn freeway 1, car ( -12, -23, right, 4 ). Since direction right, and [τ, h] for span, but in the tuple it's (head, tail, dir, speed).\n\nFor this car, head = -12, tail = -23.\n\nSince direction right, and span is [τ, h] = [tail, head]? In the car update, for right-moving, it says Span(t1) = [τ, h] so τ is tail, h is head.\n\nIn the description, it says \"head h, tail τ\" so head is h, tail is τ.\n\nFor right-moving, Span(t1) = [τ, h] which is [tail, head], so tail is left, head is right.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, Span(t1) = [h, τ] so head is right, tail is left? In the update, for left-moving, [h, τ] with h - sΔT, τ - sΔT, so if moving left, head h is the right end, tail τ is the left end.\n\nBut in the tuple, for left-moving, it might be specified.\n\nIn this problem, all cars seem to be right-moving, from the table.\n\nLook at the car state:\n\nFreeway 1: cars (-12,-23,right,4), (24,13,right,4), (60,49,right,4) — all right-moving.\n\nFreeway 2: (36,25,right,12) — right-moving.\n\nFreeway 3: (-12,-23,right,4) — right-moving.\n\nFreeway 4: same as 1, right-moving.\n\nFreeway 5: same, right-moving.\n\nFreeway 6: same, right-moving.\n\nFreeway 7: (-12,-23,right,4) — right-moving.\n\nFreeway 8: (-12,-23,right,4) — right-moving.\n\nAll cars are right-moving with speed 4 or 12.\n\nFreeway 2 has speed 12, others speed 4.\n\nAnd all directions are right, so we don't have left-moving cars here.\n\nSo for all cars, direction right, so at time t, the span is [tail + s*(t - t1), head + s*(t - t1)]? Let's write the span at absolute time τ.\n\nSet t1 = 9.\n\nAt absolute time τ, for a car with initial tail τ_init, head h_init, speed s, direction right.\n\nThen span at τ is [τ_init + s*(τ - 9), h_init + s*(τ - 9)]\n\nSince direction right.\n\nSimilarly, collision at turn τ if I am on freeway y at turn τ, and for some car on that freeway, 0 is in the span, i.e., τ_init + s*(τ - 9) ≤ 0 ≤ h_init + s*(τ - 9)\n\nSince head is larger, h_init > τ_init for right-moving cars? In the values, for example, car (-12,-23,right,4), head=-12, tail=-23, so head > tail since -12 > -23.\n\nSimilarly (24,13,right,4), 24>13, head=24, tail=13.\n\n(60,49,right,4) 60>49.\n\n(36,25,right,12) 36>25.\n\nAll have head > tail, which makes sense for right-moving.\n\nSo span at τ is [tail + s(τ-9), head + s(τ-9)] and 0 is in span if tail + s(τ-9) ≤ 0 ≤ head + s(τ-9)\n\nNow, I start at absolute time τ=9, at y=7.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nSince y=9 is the top, and I'm at y=7, I need to move up to y=8 and then to y=9.\n\nBut I have to avoid cars on y=7 and y=8 when I'm there.\n\nAlso, I can stay or move down, but since I need to go up, moving down might not help, but I might need to wait.\n\nFirst, let's list the cars on each freeway that matter.\n\nI care about freeways y=7 and y=8, since I start at y=7 and need to go to y=8 or 9.\n\nBut when I move, I might be on other freeways, but since I start at y=7 and go up, I will be on y=7, then possibly y=8, then y=9.\n\ny=9 is the target, and there are no cars on y=9, I think? The freeways are y=1 to 8, y=0 and y=9 have no cars, I assume, since not listed.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are not freeways with cars, so no collision there.\n\nSo only y=1 to 8 have cars.\n\nNow, I need to be at y=7 at time τ=9 (t=0), then I can move up to y=8 at some point, then to y=9.\n\nBut I have to ensure that when I am on y=7 or y=8, there is no car on that freeway at that time where 0 is in span.\n\nAlso, when I move to y=8, at that turn, I am still on the previous freeway until I move, I think.\n\nLet's clarify the timing.\n\nAt turn T (absolute), I choose action a_T.\n\nThen, after action, y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy_T.\n\nAnd at turn T, I am on freeway y_T.\n\nThen, for collision, at turn T, I am on y_T, and we check if for any car on freeway y_T, 0 is in span at time T.\n\nThen, after action, at turn T+1, I am on y_{T+1}, and so on.\n\nAlso, when I move, at turn T, if I go from y_T to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T, then at turn T, I am on y_T, so I check cars on y_T at time T.\n\nAt turn T+1, I am on y_{T+1}, so I check cars on y_{T+1} at time T+1.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nNow, for freeway y=7, at time τ, which cars are present.\n\nFrom table, freeway 7 has one car: (-12, -23, right, 4)\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8 has one car: (-12, -23, right, 4)\n\nFreeway 6 has three cars, but I might not be on it, but since I start at 7 and go up, I only care about y=7 and y=8 for now.\n\nI start at y=7 at τ=9.\n\nI need to leave y=7 at some point by moving up to y=8 or down to y=6, but down might not be useful.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nFirst, let's find when it is safe to be on y=7.\n\nFor freeway 7, car: tail = -23, head = -12, s=4, direction right.\n\nSpan at time τ: [ -23 + 4(τ - 9), -12 + 4(τ - 9) ]\n\n0 is in span if -23 + 4(τ - 9) ≤ 0 ≤ -12 + 4(τ - 9)\n\nSimilarly for freeway 8, same car: tail=-23, head=-12, s=4, so same span.\n\nFreeway 8 car is also (-12,-23,right,4), so identical to freeway 7 car.\n\nNow, solve for when 0 is in span for y=7.\n\n-23 + 4(τ - 9) ≤ 0 ≤ -12 + 4(τ - 9)\n\nFirst inequality: -23 + 4(τ - 9) ≤ 0 => 4(τ - 9) ≤ 23 => τ - 9 ≤ 23/4 = 5.75, so τ ≤ 9 + 5.75 = 14.75, since τ integer, τ ≤ 14\n\nτ is turn number, integer.\n\nSimilarly, second inequality: 0 ≤ -12 + 4(τ - 9) => 12 ≤ 4(τ - 9) => 3 ≤ τ - 9 => τ ≥ 12\n\nSo for y=7, car, 0 in span when τ ≥ 12 and τ ≤ 14.\n\nThat is, at times τ=12,13,14.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 8, same car, same span, so unsafe at τ=12,13,14.\n\nNow, at τ=9, where are we?\n\nAt τ=9, for y=7 car: span [ -23 + 4(0), -12 + 4(0) ] = [-23, -12], 0 not in, since -23 to -12, all negative.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nSo at τ=9, safe on y=7.\n\nI need to move to y=8 eventually.\n\ny=8 also has a car, same as y=7.\n\nNow, when is it safe on y=8? Same as above, unsafe at τ=12,13,14.\n\nBut at other times, safe.\n\nNow, I need to reach y=9.\n\ny=9 has no cars, so once I am on y=9, no collision, but I need to be at position (0,9) at some turn.\n\nThe condition is to reach (0,9), meaning y_t =9 for some t.\n\nAnd we need the sequence until we reach.\n\nNow, since I start at y=7, I can move up immediately or wait.\n\nBut I need minimal turns, so probably move up as soon as possible.\n\nBut I have to avoid the unsafe times.\n\nAt τ=9, t=0, I am at y=7.\n\nI can choose action: U, D, or S.\n\nIf I go U at τ=9, then y_{10} = 8.\n\nBut at turn τ=10, I am on y=8? Let's see.\n\nAt turn τ=9, I am on y=7, I choose action.\n\nAfter action, at τ=10, y_{10} is set.\n\nAt turn τ, I am on y_τ.\n\nSo at turn τ=9, I am on y_9=7.\n\nI choose a_9, which affects y_{10}.\n\nThen at turn τ=10, I am on y_{10}, and so on.\n\nNow, collision is checked at each turn based on current y_τ.\n\nFor example, at τ=9, y_9=7, check if collision on freeway 7 at time τ=9.\n\nAs above, span [-23,-12], 0 not in, safe.\n\nNow, if I choose a_9 = U, then y_{10} = 7 + 1 = 8.\n\nThen at turn τ=10, I am on y_{10}=8.\n\nNow, check collision on freeway 8 at time τ=10.\n\nFor freeway 8 car: span at τ=10: [ -23 + 4(10-9), -12 + 4(10-9) ] = [ -23 + 4(1), -12 + 4(1) ] = [-19, -8], which is -19 to -8, 0 not in, so safe.\n\nThen I can choose next action.\n\nIf I go to y=9 at τ=11, for example.\n\nAfter at τ=10, y=8, I choose a_10=U, then y_{11}=9.\n\nAt turn τ=11, I am on y_{11}=9, no cars, safe, and I reached y=9.\n\nBut is that possible? I need to check if at τ=10, when I was on y=8, it was safe, which it is, as above.\n\nThen at τ=11, y=9, done.\n\nH=2 turns? From t=0 to t=1, I reach at t=2? Let's index.\n\nSet t=0 at τ=9.\n\nTurn t=0 (τ=9): position y=7\n\nAction a_0: U, then y_1 = 7 +1 =8\n\nTurn t=1 (τ=10): position y=8\n\nAction a_1: U, then y_2 = 8+1=9\n\nTurn t=2 (τ=11): position y=9, reached.\n\nNow, check collisions:\n\nAt t=0 (τ=9): on y=7, car span [-23,-12], 0 not in, safe.\n\nAt t=1 (τ=10): on y=8, car span [-19,-8], 0 not in, safe.\n\nAt t=2 (τ=11): on y=9, no cars, safe.\n\nSo I reached in 2 turns.\n\nBut is there a problem? The unsafe times are τ=12,13,14 for y=7 and y=8, but here I'm at τ=10 and 11, before that, so fine.\n\nτ=10 is safe, τ=11 for y=8: span at τ=11: [ -23 +4(11-9), -12 +4(11-9) ] = [ -23 + 8, -12 +8] = [-15, -4], still negative, 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, at τ=12: [ -23 +4(3), -12 +12] = [ -23+12, -12+12] = [-11, 0], now 0 is included, since ≤0≤0? The inequality: tail + sΔT ≤ 0 ≤ head + sΔT\n\nAt τ=12, ΔT=3, tail + sΔT = -23 +12 = -11 ≤0, head + sΔT = -12 +12=0 ≤0? 0 ≤ 0 is true, so yes, 0 is in span at τ=12.\n\nSimilarly, τ=13: [-23+16, -12+16] = [-7,4], 0 in since -7≤0≤4.\n\nτ=14: [-23+20, -12+20] = [-3,8], 0 in.\n\nτ=15: [-23+24, -12+24] = [1,12], 0 not <=1? 1>0, so 0 not >=1? 0 <1, not in span.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut in our case, at τ=10 and 11, not unsafe.\n\nSo with two moves up, I can reach.\n\nBut the player position is (0,y), and cars are on the freeway, but since x=0, and we care if 0 is in the car span, which is about the x-position.\n\nIn this case, it worked.\n\nBut let me check other freeways, but I was only on y=7 and y=8.\n\ny=7 and y=8 have cars, but at the times, safe.\n\nIn the sequence, I moved directly.\n\nBut is there any reason I cannot? For example, are there cars on other freeways that might affect? But I was not on them, so no.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider if I stay or something, but minimal turns, 2 seems fine.\n\nBut let me see the car on freeway 2, but I was not on it.\n\nPerhaps I should confirm the time.\n\nt1=9, absolute.\n\nAt τ=9, y=7.\n\nAfter action U at τ=9, to y=8 at τ=10.\n\nThen U at τ=10 to y=9 at τ=11.\n\nAt τ=10, on y=8, span [-19,-8], not include 0.\n\nAt τ=11, on y=9, safe.\n\nBut at τ=11, if I were on y=8, it would be unsafe? But I'm on y=9.\n\nAt τ=11, y=8 car span: as above, [-15,-4], not include 0.\n\nOnly from τ=12.\n\nSo seems fine.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), which I do at τ=11.\n\nBut in the action sequence, I need to output for turns starting from t1.\n\nIn the answer, it should be:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t1} which is a9\n\nTurn t1+1: a10\n\netc.\n\nIn my notation, t=0 is τ=9, a_0 is action at τ=9.\n\nThen after H turns, at turn H, y_H=9.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t=0 to H-1, and y_H=9.\n\nIn this case, H=2, actions at t=0 and t=1, y at t=2 is 9.\n\ny_t at turn t.\n\nAt start, turn t=0, y0=7.\n\nAfter action a0, y1 = y0 + Δy0.\n\nAfter a1, y2 = y1 + Δy1.\n\nWhen y_t =9 for some t.\n\nIn this case, with a0=U, y1=8\n\na1=U, y2=9\n\nSo at t=2, y=9.\n\nMinimal H should be 2.\n\nBut is there a way in 1 turn? From y=7, if I go U, to y=8 at next turn, but y=8 not 9, so I need at least two actions to go from 7 to 9, since each action changes by at most 1.\n\ny_t changes by -1,0,1 each step, so from 7 to 9, need at least two up moves, so H at least 2.\n\nAnd I have a sequence in 2.\n\nBut in the car state, freeway 7 and 8 have the same car, but at τ=10, safe.\n\nBut let me check if at τ=10, for y=8, is there any car? Freeway 8 has one car, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut in the table, freeway 1 has multiple cars, but I don't care.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if I can go faster, but I can't, since max +1 per turn.\n\nMaybe I need to avoid by staying or moving down, but that would increase H, not minimal.\n\nSo H=2 should be fine.\n\nBut let me double-check the collision condition.\n\nAt turn τ=10, I am on y=8, freeway 8 has car with span at τ=10: [ -23 +4(1), -12 +4(1) ] = [-19, -8], min x=-19, max x=-8, both negative, 0 not in, so no collision.\n\nSimilarly at τ=9, y=7, span [-23,-12], no.\n\nAnd at τ=11, I am on y=9, no car.\n\nBut when I move to y=9 at τ=11, at turn τ=11, I am on y=11=9, no car.\n\nBut is there any issue with the car on y=8 at that time? No, because I'm not on y=8.\n\nAnother thing: the note says that if I move to a different freeway, I am not considered on the new freeway until the next turn.\n\nIn this case, when I move from y=7 to y=8 at τ=10, at turn τ=9, I am on y=7, and I choose U, so at τ=10, I am on y=8.\n\nNo issue.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 2, which has speed 12, but I'm not on it.\n\nFreeway 2 is y=2, I'm on 7 and 8.\n\nBut let me see the cars on other freeways, but since I'm not on them, irrelevant.\n\nFor example, freeway 6 has cars, but I never on y=6.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think H=2 is possible.\n\nBut the problem is to output the sequence.\n\nIn the answer format.\n\nTurn t1: a_{t1} , which is U\n\nTurn t1+1: a_{t1+1}, U\n\nThen done.\n\nt1=9.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nAnd I reach at turn 11.\n\nBut the sequence is for actions from t=0 to H-1.\n\nIn terms of absolute, action at turn 9 and turn 10.\n\nThen position at turn 11 is (0,9).\n\nNow, but let me confirm if at turn 10, when I am on y=8, is there any car that could hit?\n\nFreeway 8 only has that one car, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut in the car list, for freeway 8, only one car: (-12,-23,right,4)\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut let me see freeway 6, for example, but I'm not on it.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if I need to go through other rows, but no, I can go directly up.\n\nMaybe at some times it is unsafe to move, but here it seems safe.\n\nAnother thought: at τ=11, if I were on y=8, it would be safe, but I'm not.\n\nτ=11: for y=8 car, span [ -23 +4(2), -12 +4(2) ] = [-23+8, -12+8] = [-15,-4], not include 0.\n\nOnly τ=12,13,14 unsafe.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nPerhaps the minimal H is 2.\n\nBut let me see if I can do it in H=1, impossible.\n\nOr if I stay, H larger.\n\nSo I think 2 is minimal.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 2, there is a car with speed 12, but I'm not on y=2.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways have cars, but not relevant.\n\nFor example, freeway 1 has cars at (-12,-23,right,4), etc., but y=1, not where I am.\n\nSo I think no issue.\n\nTherefore, the sequence should be:\n\nAt turn 9: U\n\nAt turn 10: U\n\nThen at turn 11, position (0,9).\n\nNow, in the answer format.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\n}\n\nBut let me write it properly.\n\nThe turn is t_1, which is 9.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 9: a_{9} (which is U)\n\nIn the format: Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\n\nThen Turn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1}\n\netc.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nAnd H=2.\n\nBut the player reaches at turn 11, but the actions are for turns 9 and 10.\n\nThe sequence is {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nt from 0 to H-1.\n\nIn this case, t=0: a_{9+0} = a9\n\nt=1: a_{10}\n\nThen after H=2 actions, at time t=2, y=9.\n\nYes.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if moving down or staying could avoid something, but no need.\n\nAnother thing: the freeway y=7 and y=8 have the same car position, but at different times.\n\nBut in this case, fine.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 7, at τ=9, safe, but if I stay, it might become unsafe, but I don't stay.\n\nSuppose I stay at y=7 at τ=9, then at τ=10, still on y=7, span at τ=10: for y=7 car, [ -23 +4(1), -12 +4(1) ] = [-19,-8], safe, but I waste a turn.\n\nThen I can move later, but H larger.\n\nSimilarly, moving down to y=6, but then I have to come back, more turns.\n\nSo not minimal.\n\nTherefore, the minimal is to move up immediately.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n\nBut let me check the car on freeway 2 quickly.\n\nFreeway 2: (36,25,right,12)\n\nAt τ=9, span [25 +12(0), 36 +12(0)]? Wait.\n\nTail=25, head=36, s=12.\n\nAt time τ, span [25 + 12(τ-9), 36 + 12(τ-9)]\n\n0 in span if 25 +12(τ-9) ≤ 0 ≤ 36 +12(τ-9)\n\nFirst, 25 +12(τ-9) ≤0 => 12(τ-9) ≤ -25, impossible since left side >=0 for τ>=9? τ-9 >=0, so 12(τ-9) >=0, 25>0, so min span is at least 25>0, so 0 never in span for this car.\n\nSimilarly, other cars with positive head and tail, like (24,13,right,4), min at τ=9 is 13>0, so 0 not in, and as time increases, min increases, so never include 0.\n\nSimilarly, (60,49,right,4), min 49>0.\n\nThe cars that can include 0 are those with negative or cross zero.\n\nIn this case, only the cars like (-12,-23,right,4) which have negative values, and move right, so at some point cross zero.\n\nIn our case, for y=7 and y=8, only that car.\n\nFor freeway 3, also (-12,-23,right,4), same.\n\nBut I'm not on it.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 4,5,6 have multiple, but min and max, for example, freeway 1: cars (-12,-23,right,4), (24,13,right,4), (60,49,right,4)\n\nNow, (24,13,right,4), at τ=9, [13,24], both positive, 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly (60,49) [49,60], positive.\n\nOnly the first one can have 0 in span, as we calculated.\n\nBut for y=7 and y=8, only one car each, the negative one.\n\nSo I think my earlier plan is fine.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 2, with actions U at turn 9 and U at turn 10.\n\nSo the answer should be:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\n}\n\nIn the format, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc., so I think it's clear.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 7) at turn \\(t_1 = 9\\).

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,8) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. I'm at y=8 now, and I need to get to y=9. Since y=9 is the top, and there are no freeways above it, I think y=9 is safe; the cars are only on y=1 to y=8. So I just need to move up to y=9 without getting hit by cars on y=8 or any other freeway I might be on during the moves.\n\nThe player position is given as (0, y_t), and we're moving vertically, I assume. The grid is 2D, but only the y-coordinate changes, and x=0 is where we are, I think. The cars are on horizontal freeways, so they move left or right, and we're at x=0, so collision happens if at the turn we're on a freeway where a car spans x=0.\n\nThe collision rule: at turn T, if we are on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there is a car such that 0 is in its span at that turn, then collision.\n\nAlso, when we move, at turn T, we are on y_T, and we choose action to go to y_{T+1}. But at the moment of turn T, we are on y_T, so we check for cars on freeway y_T at turn T.\n\nIf we move to a different freeway, we are not on that freeway at turn T, only at T+1.\n\nIn this case, I'm at (0,8) at turn t_1=10.\n\nI need to reach (0,9), which means I need to have y=9 at some turn.\n\nThe minimal H such that after H turns, y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9.\n\nLet's clarify the indexing.\n\nAt turn t_1, which is 10, I am at position (0, y_{10}) = (0,8).\n\nAfter one action, at turn t_1 + 1 = 11, I go to y_{11} based on action a_{10}.\n\nThe sequence of actions is from t=0 to H-1, but t here is relative to t_1.\n\nThe sequence is {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nSo for t=0, a_{t1 + 0} = a_{10}, which determines y_{11}.\n\nThen after H actions, at turn t1 + H, the position is y_{t1 + H}.\n\nBut we want y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9? Let me read.\n\n\"reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H - 1\"\n\nTurn t1 + H - 1.\n\nAt turn t1, position is (0, y_{t1}) = (0,8)\n\nAfter first action a_{t1}, at turn t1+1, position is (0, y_{t1+1})\n\n...\n\nAfter k actions, at turn t1+k, position is (0, y_{t1+k})\n\nWe want that at some turn T, y_T = 9, and T = t1 + H - 1.\n\nSo the position after H-1 actions is at turn t1 + (H-1), with y_{t1 + H-1} = 9.\n\nLet's set t = turn number.\n\nAt turn t, position is (0, y_t)\n\nAction a_t is taken at turn t, affecting y_{t+1}.\n\ny_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with Δy_t based on a_t.\n\nSo at turn t, we are at y_t, and we choose a_t, which sets y_{t+1}.\n\nThen at turn t+1, we are at y_{t+1}, and so on.\n\nTo have y_T = 9 for some T.\n\nIn this case, at turn t1=10, we are at y_10=8.\n\nWe want y_T = 9 for T = t1 + H - 1.\n\nSo after (H-1) actions, we reach y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9.\n\nThe actions are from t = t1 to t1 + H - 2? Let's see.\n\nActions: a_t for t from t1 to t1 + H - 1? No.\n\nThe sequence is {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nSo for t=0, a_{t1}, which affects y_{t1+1}\n\nFor t=1, a_{t1+1}, affects y_{t1+2}\n\n...\n\nFor t=H-1, a_{t1 + H -1}, which affects y_{t1 + H}\n\nBut we want y_{t1 + H -1} = 9.\n\ny_{t1 + H -1} is set by the action at turn t1 + H -2? Let's clarify.\n\nAt turn τ, position y_τ is determined, and we choose a_τ, which sets y_{τ+1}.\n\nSo for τ from t1 to t1 + H - 2, we choose a_τ to set y_{τ+1}.\n\nThen at turn t1 + H -1, we have y_{t1 + H -1} = 9.\n\nThe last action that affects this is a_{t1 + H -2}, which sets y_{t1 + H -1}.\n\nBut y_{t1 + H -1} could be 9 without any action if we were already there, but we are at 8, so we need to move.\n\nThe actions are from t1 to t1 + H - 2, and at turn t1 + H -1, we are at 9.\n\nThe sequence of actions has H elements, from a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H -1}.\n\nFor a_{t1 + H -1}, it is chosen at turn t1 + H -1, which sets y_{t1 + H}.\n\nBut we want y_{t1 + H -1} = 9, which is set by a_{t1 + H -2} at turn t1 + H -2.\n\nSo a_{t1 + H -1} is not used for reaching y=9 at turn t1+H-1; it might be for something else, but the goal is just to reach (0,9), so once we are at (0,9), we stop, I think. But the sequence includes actions until we reach, but the last action sets the position after.\n\nI think there's a confusion in the indexing.\n\nLet me read the task: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H -1.\"\n\nAnd \"y_{t1 + H -1} = 9\"\n\nNow, at turn t1, y_t1 = 8.\n\nAfter 0 actions, at turn t1, we are at 8, not 9.\n\nAfter 1 action: at turn t1+1, y_t1+1 could be 7,8,9 depending on action.\n\nIf we do U at t1, y_t1+1 = 9, so at turn t1+1, we are at 9.\n\nThen T = t1 +1, and H-1 =1? Let's see.\n\nT = t1 + H -1 = t1 +1, so H-1 =1, thus H=2.\n\nActions: t from 0 to H-1 =1, so t=0, a_t1.\n\nOne action a_t1, which is U, and at turn t1+1, we are at 9.\n\nIf we do nothing, S, y_t1+1=8, not 9.\n\nD, y_t1+1=7, worse.\n\nSo to reach in one step, H=2, actions: a_t1 = U, then at turn t1+1, y=9.\n\nT = t1+1 = t1 + H -1, so H-1 =1, H=2.\n\nSimilarly, if we need more turns.\n\nIn this case, I'm at y=8, I can go to y=9 with U, but I need to check if at turn t1=10, when I am on y=8, if there is a car on y=8 at x=0.\n\nBecause at turn T, if I am on freeway y_T, and 0 in car span, collision.\n\nSo at turn t1=10, I am on y=8, so I need to check if for freeway 8, at turn 10, is there a car with 0 in its span.\n\nSimilarly, if I move to y=9, at turn t1+1=11, I am on y=9, but y=9 has no cars, I think, since cars on y=1 to 8 only, so y=9 is safe.\n\nThe freeways are y=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, I assume, so no cars there, so safe.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are the boundaries, probably no cars, so when at y=0 or y=9, no collision possible.\n\nIn this case, at turn t1=10, I am at y=8, which has cars.\n\nI need to check if at turn 10, on freeway 8, is x=0 occupied by a car.\n\nIf not, I can move up to y=9 at turn 11, and be safe.\n\nIf it is occupied, I might need to wait or something.\n\nFirst, let's list the cars for each freeway.\n\nFreeway k=1 to 8, but only some have cars.\n\nGiven:\n\nFreeway 1: three cars: (-8,-19, right,4), (28,17,right,4), (-48,-59,right,4)\n\nDirection right, so they are moving right, so head is to the right, tail left.\n\nIn the span, for right-moving, span is [tail, head] with tail < head.\n\nIn the car state, it says \"head h, tail τ\", and for right-moving, span [τ, h], so τ should be less than h.\n\nBut look: for freeway 1, first car: h=-8, τ=-19, d=right.\n\n-8 > -19, so tail τ=-19, head h=-8, so span [-19, -8] at t1=10.\n\nSimilarly, second car: h=28, τ=17? 28>17, so span [17,28]\n\nBut 17 to 28, head 28, tail 17, that doesn't make sense because if moving right, head should be greater, but 28>17, so [17,28] is from left to right, so at x=17, tail, x=28 head.\n\nBut the values: τ=17, h=28, so τ=17 is tail, h=28 is head, so span [17,28].\n\nSimilarly, third car: h=-48, τ=-59, -48 > -59, so span [-59,-48].\n\nNow, at turn t=10, for freeway 1, cars at [ -19,-8], [17,28], [-59,-48], all moving right at speed 4.\n\nx=0: is 0 in any span? [ -19,-8] : -19 to -8, 0 is not between, since -8 < 0? -8 is less than 0, but -19 < -8 < 0, so -8 < 0, so 0 > -8, not in [-19,-8]. Similarly, [17,28], 17>0, not include 0. [-59,-48], all negative, not include 0. So at t=10, freeway 1 has no car at x=0.\n\nBut we are not on freeway 1 now, we are on freeway 8.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: only one car: (48,37,right,12) h=48, τ=37, d=right, so since right, span [τ,h] = [37,48], at t=10. 0 not in.\n\nFreeway 3: one car: (-8,-19,right,4) same as freeway 1 first car, span [-19,-8], 0 not in.\n\nFreeway 4: three cars same as freeway 1: (-8,-19,right,4), (28,17,right,4)? h=28,τ=17, so [17,28], and (-48,-59,right,4) [-59,-48]. 0 not in any.\n\nSimilarly freeway 5: same as 1 and 4.\n\nFreeway 6: same.\n\nFreeway 7: one car (-8,-19,right,4) [-19,-8]\n\nFreeway 8: one car (-8,-19,right,4) [-19,-8]\n\nWe are on freeway 8 at turn t1=10.\n\nFor freeway 8, at turn 10, car span [-19,-8], which is from x=-19 to x=-8. x=0 is not in this interval since -8 < 0. So no car at x=0 at turn 10.\n\nTherefore, I can safely be at y=8 at turn 10 without collision.\n\nNow, I want to move to y=9. So action a_{10} = U, then y_{11} = 8 +1 =9.\n\nAt turn 11, I am at y=9, which has no cars, so safe.\n\nThen I have reached (0,9) at turn 11, which is t1 +1 =10+1=11.\n\nNow, T = t1 + H -1 =11, so 10 + H -1 =11, thus H-1=1, H=2.\n\nActions: sequence from t=0 to H-1=1, so t=0: a_{t1 +0} = a_{10} = U\n\nThat's it, one action.\n\nBut the sequence should have H actions, from t=0 to H-1.\n\nFor H=2, t=0 and t=1, actions a_{10} and a_{11}.\n\nBut at turn 11, I am already at y=9, so I don't need to do anything, but I might need to specify action for a_{11}, but since I have reached, I can choose S or something.\n\nThe goal is to reach at turn t1 + H -1, and the actions are up to a_{t1 + H -1}.\n\nIn this case, for T= t1 + H -1 =11, so t1 + H -1 =11, t1=10, so 10 + H -1 =11, H=2.\n\nActions: a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to 1.\n\nt=0: a_{10}, which sets y_{11}\n\nt=1: a_{11}, which sets y_{12}\n\nBut we want y_{11} =9, which is set by a_{10}.\n\na_{11} is for after we have reached, so it doesn't matter, but we need to include it in the sequence.\n\nIn the answer, we need to output the actions until the turn before we reach, I think, but let's see the format.\n\n\"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\"\n\nAnd \"reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H -1\"\n\nIn this case, with a_{10}=U, y_{11}=9, so at turn 11, we are at (0,9).\n\nThen for a_{11}, we can set it to S, for example, since we are already there.\n\nBut the minimal H, we can have H=2, with actions U and then S, but we reach at turn 11.\n\nIf I do only one action, but H must be at least 1? With H=1, actions from t=0 to 0, only a_{10}.\n\nThen y_{11} is set, but at turn t1 + H -1 =10 +1 -1=10, we are at y=8, not 9. So we need H such that t1 + H -1 >= t1, and y_{t1 + H -1}=9.\n\nSince at t1 we are at 8, we need at least one action to move to 9, so minimal H=2, with y_{11}=9.\n\nThen actions: a_{10} and a_{11}, with a_{10}=U to go to 9, and a_{11} can be S or U or D, but since we are at 9, moving up might go beyond, but y in [0,9], so if at 9, U would go to 10, but y=10 not allowed, so probably we should not go beyond, so S is safe.\n\nSimilarly, D to 8, but we want to be at 9, but the position at turn t1+H-1=11 is 9, regardless of a_{11}.\n\nBut for the action at turn 11, it sets y_{12}, but we don't care about after.\n\nIn the sequence, we need to specify actions for all turns from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nBut since we reach at turn t1+H-1, the action at that turn is not necessary for reaching, but we have to include it.\n\nIn this case, since at turn 11 we are at 9, we can do a_{11}=S to stay.\n\nNow, back to the car: at turn 10, on freeway 8, no car at x=0, so safe.\n\nThen move to y=9 at turn 11, safe.\n\nBut is there any issue?\n\nThe car on freeway 8: at turn 10, span [-19,-8], moving right at speed 4.\n\nAt turn 11, the car will have moved: since right-moving, at turn T, span [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]? Let's see the update.\n\nCar update: for turn T > t1.\n\nAt turn T, span for right-moving: [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nSince original at t1: [τ, h]\n\nAfter (T-t1) turns, moved right by s per turn, so tail becomes τ + s(T-t1), head h + s(T-t1), so span [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but here all are right-moving.\n\nFor freeway 8 at turn 10, car: τ=-19, h=-8, s=4, d=right.\n\nAt turn 10, span [-19, -8]\n\nAt turn 11, T=11, T-t1=1, so span [ -19 + 4(1), -8 + 4(1) ] = [-15, -4]\n\nStill not at x=0.\n\nx=0 not in [-15,-4].\n\nSo at turn 11, if I were on y=8, but I am moving to y=9 at turn 11, so at turn 11, I am on y=9, not on y=8.\n\nThe collision is only when on the freeway at that turn.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, with H=2, actions: a_{10} = U, a_{11} = S (for example)\n\nBut the problem is to reach at turn t1 + H -1, which is turn 11 for H=2.\n\nBut let me confirm if I can reach faster or if there is a problem.\n\nPerhaps I can reach in one turn, but at turn t1=10, I am at 8, to be at 9 at turn t1=10, impossible, since position is fixed at turn start.\n\nSo minimal H=2.\n\nBut is there a car at x=0 on y=8 at some turn?\n\nIn this case, no.\n\nBut let me check all freeways quickly, but since I only care about the freeways I am on during the path.\n\nIn this direct path, I am only on y=8 at turn 10 and y=9 at turn 11.\n\ny=9 no cars.\n\ny=8 at turn 10: safe.\n\nSo it should be fine.\n\nBut let me see the car state again.\n\nFreeway 8 has only one car: (-8,-19,right,4), so at t=10, [-19,-8], 0 not in.\n\nAt t=11, [-15,-4], 0 not in.\n\nNow, when would it be at x=0?\n\nSet h + s(T-t1) = -8 + 4(T-10)\n\nSet equal to 0: -8 + 4(T-10) =0, 4(T-10)=8, T-10=2, T=12.\n\nSimilarly, tail at T=12: τ + s(T-t1) = -19 + 4(2) = -19+8= -11\n\nHead: -8 + 8 =0? -8 + 4*2 = -8+8=0.\n\nSo at turn T=12, head at 0, tail at -11? Span [ -19 + 4(12-10), -8 + 4(12-10) ] = [-19+8, -8+8] = [-11, 0]\n\nSo at turn 12, span includes x=0, since [ -11, 0], 0 is included.\n\nBut I am not on y=8 at turn 12, I am at y=9.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 2.\n\nBut the player starts at (0,8) at turn 10, and with U at turn 10, to y=9 at turn 11.\n\nThen action at turn 11 can be S.\n\nSo sequence: Turn 10: U, Turn 11: S\n\nBut in the answer, it should be from turn t1 to t1 + H -1.\n\nH=2, turns t1 to t1+1, i.e., 10 and 11.\n\nBut let me see if H can be smaller? H=1: only turn t1=10, but at turn 10, y=8, not 9.\n\nImpossible.\n\nSo H=2 is minimal.\n\nBut the problem might be that at turn 10, I need to output action, and at turn 11.\n\nIn the car list, freeway 8 has car, but not at x=0.\n\nAnother thing: freeway 8 has only one car, but in the table, it says for freeway 8: (-8,-19,right,4), same as others.\n\nBut let me confirm the car state.\n\n\"Freeway 8 | (-8, -19, right, 4)\"\n\nYes.\n\nPerhaps I should check if for other freeways, but I don't go there.\n\nBut just to be thorough, suppose I had to move down or something, but here not necessary.\n\nPerhaps the cars on other freeways might affect if I move, but in this case, I move directly up.\n\nAnother point: when I move from y=8 to y=9, at turn 10, I am on y=8, no issue.\n\nThen at turn 11, on y=9, no cars.\n\nSo safe.\n\nPerhaps I can do it in H=2.\n\nBut the answer should be minimal H, which is 2.\n\nBut let me see the initial position is (0,8), and need to (0,9), so adjacent.\n\nUnless blocked, but not blocked.\n\nPerhaps at turn 10, if I do U, I go to y=9 at turn 11, but during the move, is there any intermediate state? No, the position changes instantly at turn end.\n\nThe collision is only checked at the turn when we are on the freeway.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nBut let me read the note: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 in span at T but not at T+1.\"\n\nIn this case, not relevant.\n\nSo for this, it should work.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=2.\n\nActions: a_{10} = U, a_{11} = S (or U or D, but S is fine).\n\nNow, in the output, it should be:\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: S\n\nBut since at turn 11 we are at 9, and S keeps it, or we can do nothing, but action must be specified.\n\nPerhaps we can have H=2 with only moving, but we need two actions.\n\nAnother thought: can I reach at turn 10? No, because at turn 10 I am at 8.\n\nUnless I was moving before, but no, position is given at turn 10.\n\nSo I think H=2 is correct.\n\nBut let me see if for some reason I cannot move up immediately.\n\nFor example, if at turn 10, x=0 was occupied on y=8, but it's not.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider the next turns.\n\nSuppose I do S at turn 10, then at turn 11, I am still at y=8.\n\nThen at turn 11, if I do U, to y=9 at turn 12.\n\nBut that takes more turns, H=3, worse.\n\nSimilarly, if I move down, worse.\n\nSo minimal is to go up immediately.\n\nTherefore, for this case, it should be straightforward.\n\nBut let me double-check the car positions.\n\nFreeway 8 at turn t1=10: car with h=-8, τ=-19, s=4, right-moving.\n\nSpan at t=10: [τ, h] = [-19, -8] since right, and τ < h.\n\nx=0: -8 < 0, so 0 not in [-19,-8].\n\nAt t=11: [ -19 +4(1), -8 +4(1) ] = [-15, -4], 0 not in.\n\nAt t=12: [-19+8, -8+8] = [-11,0], 0 is included, so if on y=8 at turn 12, collision.\n\nBut I am not there.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways have cars, but not at x=0 at relevant times.\n\nFor example, freeway 7: similar car, at t=10: [-19,-8], etc.\n\nBut I don't care.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 2.\n\nSequence: a_{10} = U, a_{11} = S\n\nIn the answer format:\n\n\\boxed{ Turn 10: U\\\\ Turn 11: S }\n\nBut let me write it properly.\n\nThe turn is t_1=10, so:\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: S\n\nSince H=2, turns from t1 to t1+H-1=11.\n\nt1 + H -1 =10 +2 -1=11, yes.\n\nNow, I think that's the answer.\n\nBut the problem has many cars listed, but for this move, only freeway 8 matters, and it's clear.\n\nPerhaps I misread the car for freeway 8.\n\n\"Freeway 8 | (-8, -19, right, 4)\"\n\nYes.\n\nh=-8, τ=-19, so tail -19, head -8, span [-19,-8].\n\nx=0 not in.\n\nPerhaps the coordinates: head and tail, but for right-moving, head is the front, so if moving right, head has higher x.\n\nHere h=-8, τ=-19, so at x=-19 tail, x=-8 head, moving to increasing x.\n\nSo at t=10, from -19 to -8.\n\nx=0 is to the right, not covered.\n\nYes.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 8) at turn \\(t_1 = 10\\). The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\), avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\nAt turn 10, the player is on freeway \\(y = 8\\). The car on freeway 8 has a span of \\([-19, -8]\\) at turn 10, and since the car is moving right at speed 4, \\(x = 0\\) is not within this span. Therefore, the player is safe at turn 10.\n\nTo reach \\(y = 9\\), the player can move up (action \\(U\\)) at turn 10, resulting in \\(y_{11} = 9\\). At turn 11, the player is on \\(y = 9\\), which has no cars, so it is safe. Thus, the player reaches (0, 9) at turn 11.\n\nThe turn \\(T = t_1 + H - 1 = 11\\) must satisfy \\(y_T = 9\\). With \\(t_1 = 10\\), solving \\(10 + H - 1 = 11\\) gives \\(H = 2\\). The sequence of actions has \\(H = 2\\) elements, from \\(t = 0\\) to \\(t = 1\\) relative to \\(t_1\\).\n\n- At turn 10 (\\(t = 0\\)), action \\(a_{10} = U\\) moves the player to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 11.\n- At turn 11 (\\(t = 1\\)), action \\(a_{11} = S\\) is chosen to stay at \\(y = 9\\), as no further movement is needed.\n\nThis sequence achieves the goal in the minimal \\(H = 2\\) turns.\n\n\\boxed{ Turn 10: U\\\\ Turn 11: S }",
