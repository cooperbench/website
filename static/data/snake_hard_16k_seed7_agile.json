It's turn 0, and the grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think? Walls are at x=0 and x=7, so x from 1 to 6, and y from 1 to 6? Let me confirm.\n> \n> Border cells: x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. So the grid is 8x8, with cells from (0,0) to (7,7), but the walls are at the borders, so the snake can only be on cells where 1 ≤ x ≤ 6 and 1 ≤ y ≤ 6. Similarly for food.\n> \n> Internal obstacles are given: [(5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1)]. These are also blocked, so snake can't go there.\n> \n> Snake positions: only one segment, [(3,3)]. So the snake is just the head at (3,3), no body yet. That means it's length 1, so eating food will increase length.\n> \n> Head direction is L, meaning left. So currently facing left.\n> \n> Food:\n> \n> - (3,1) with value 1, life span 10\n> \n> - (3,2) with value 1, life span 10\n> \n> - (1,6) with value 1, life span 10\n> \n> All food is positive, value 1, and life span 10, so they disappear after 10 turns, including this turn, so countdown decreases each turn.\n> \n> Since snake is at (3,3) and head direction left, possible moves: U (up), D (down), L (left), R (right). But no instant reverse, so since current direction is L, I cannot move R (right) on this turn. So possible actions: U, D, L.\n> \n> Moving L would go to (2,3), U to (3,4), D to (3,2).\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score and prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> First, since the snake has no body, there's no body collision risk yet.

Then the head is at (3,2), and there's a body segment at (3,3). But since I just ate, the tail doesn't move yet? When you eat, the snake grows, so after moving to (3,2), the snake becomes [(3,2), (3,3)], head at (3,2), tail at (3,3).\n> \n> Then on next turn, if I move, the tail will stay or move? Standard snake: when you move, the head moves to new position, and if you didn't eat, tail moves forward, so last segment is removed. If you ate, tail doesn't move, so length increases.\n> \n> In this case, if I eat at (3,2), after move, snake is [(3,2), (3,3)].\n> \n> Then next turn, if I move down to (3,1), I can eat that food too, since (3,1) has food.\n> \n> (3,1) has food, value 1.\n> \n> But let's see the grid and obstacles.\n> \n> First, obstacles: list is (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1)\n> \n> (3,4) is an obstacle, so I cannot go there.\n> \n> (3,4) is directly above (3,3), so moving U to (3,4) is impossible because it's an obstacle.\n> \n> Similarly, moving L to (2,3): is (2,3) free?

Obstacles: (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), but (1,3) not listed, so free.\n> \n> Also, food at (1,6), which is north-east.\n> \n> But let's think about the food life span. All life span 10, so from turn 0, they disappear after 10 turns, meaning on turn 10 they are gone, I think. Life span decreases each turn including current, so at turn 0, life span 10, after turn 0, it becomes 9, and so on, until 0, it disappears. So it can be eaten until turn 9? Let's clarify.\n> \n> Life span N: disappears after N turns. Countdown decreases every turn including current.\n> \n> So at turn t, food has life span L, it will disappear at turn t + L.\n> \n> It can be eaten on turns t to t+L-1, I think.\n> \n> For example, at turn 0, life span 10, it is present from turn 0 to turn 9, disappears at turn 10.\n> \n> Similarly, can be eaten on turn 0 to 9.\n> \n> Here all food has life span 10 at turn 0, so I have until turn 9 to eat them.\n> \n> Now, back to decision.\n> \n> If I move D to (3,2) at turn 0, I eat one food, score +1, length 2.\n> \n> Then at turn 1, I can move to (3,1) to eat another, but (3,1) has food, so if I move D, I eat it, score +2 total, length 3, but then at (3,1), surrounded: U body, D wall, L and R free but I need to move away.\n> \n> If I move L to (2,1) or R to (4,1).\n> \n> Say I move L to (2,1), no food, so snake moves to [(2,1), (3,1), (3,2)]? After eating at (3,1), snake is [(3,1), (3,2), (3,3)].\n> \n> Then move to (2,1): head to (2,1), body: since no eat, tail moves, so the last segment (3,3) is removed, snake becomes [(2,1), (3,1), (3,2)]? Let's sequence.\n> \n> At turn 0: start at [(3,3)], move D to (3,2), eat, so now snake [(3,2), (3,3)]\n> \n> Turn 1: move D to (3,1), eat, so now snake [(3,1), (3,2), (3,3)]  (length 3)\n> \n> Turn 2: move L to (2,1), no food, so head to (2,1), tail moves away from (3,3), so snake becomes [(2,1), (3,1), (3,2)]? Positions: head to (2,1), then body segments: previous head was (3,1), now it's body, and (3,2) body, tail was (3,3) but since no eat, tail is removed, so segments: new head (2,1), then the first body is (3,1), then (3,2).

So I must avoid these cells.\n> \n> The snake positions are: head at (3,2) and body at (3,3). Since there are only two segments, the tail is at (3,3). The head direction is down, which is D. That means the snake is moving downward, so from (3,2) to (3,3) was the previous move, but since direction is given as D, I think that's the current moving direction.\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (3,1) with value 1, life span 9\n> \n> - (1,6) with value 1, life span 9\n> \n> - (6,3) with value 1, life span 10\n> \n> All food has positive value, +1, so no negative food here.

After moving, the new head will be at (3,3), and the tail was at (3,3), but when the snake moves, the tail moves to where the body was or something.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when snake moves, head goes to new position, each segment moves to the position of the previous segment. So with two segments: head at (3,2), tail at (3,3). If I move down to (3,3), new head position is (3,3).

It has life span 9, so it will disappear after turn 9, but since current turn 1, it has 8 more turns? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 1, life span 9, after turn 1, it becomes 8, and so on, disappears when life span 0.\n> \n> So for (3,1), life span 9 at turn 1, so it will be there until turn 9, and disappear at turn 10 or something? Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So at turn t, food has life span L, it means it will disappear after L turns, so at turn t+L, it's gone. Countdown decreases each turn, so at turn t, countdown L, turn t+1, countdown L-1, ..., turn t+L-1, countdown 1, then at turn t+L, it disappears before the turn or after? Typically, it should be available until the end of turn when countdown reaches 0.\n> \n> But for movement, we move on each turn, so if life span is 1 at turn t, it is still there when we move on turn t, and disappears after that turn.\n> \n> Similarly here, at turn 1, life span 9, so it will be there for turns 1 to 9, and disappear at turn 10.\n> \n> Similarly for others: (1,6) life span 9, (6,3) life span 10, so (6,3) lasts one turn longer.\n> \n> But since we are at turn 1, all have plenty of time.\n> \n> Now, back to actions.\n> \n> I need to maximize score, so I should try to eat food when possible, but with long-term survival.\n> \n> First, let's consider moving towards (3,1) since it's close.\n> \n> But I can't directly, so I need to set up for it.\n> \n> If I move left to (2,2) on turn 1.\n> \n> Then on turn 2, from (2,2), I can move up to (2,1).\n> \n> Then on turn 3, from (2,1), I can move right to (3,1) to eat the food.\n> \n> That seems straightforward.\n> \n> If I move right to (4,2) on turn 1, then to (4,1) or (4,3), it takes more moves to reach (3,1).\n> \n> Similarly, if I move down to (3,3), I'm farther away.\n> \n> So moving left seems best to get to (3,1) quickly.\n> \n> But is there any risk?\n> \n> When I move to (3,1) on turn 3, what happens.\n> \n> Turn 1: move L to (2,2).

So the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), but with internal obstacles.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: [(5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1)]\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (2,2), body at (3,2). So the snake is only two segments long right now. Head direction is left, meaning it was moving left to get to (2,2) from (3,2).\n> \n> Food:\n> \n> - (3,1) with value 1, life span 8\n> \n> - (1,6) with value 1, life span 8\n> \n> - (6,3) with value 1, life span 9\n> \n> All food is positive since value is +1. No negative food mentioned.\n> \n> I need to plan 5+ turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks. Since the snake is short, eating food will make it grow, which could lead to self-collision risks later.\n> \n> Current head position: (2,2)\n> \n> Possible moves: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), L (left, x-1), R (right, x+1)\n> \n> But head direction is L, so I cannot move right (opposite) on this turn because of the no instant reverse rule. So possible actions: U, D, L. Moving right would be reverse, not allowed.\n> \n> So from (2,2):\n> \n> - U: to (2,3)\n> \n> - D: to (2,1)\n> \n> - L: to (1,2)\n> \n> Now, check for collisions:\n> \n> - Walls: borders at x=0,7 y=0,7, so (2,3), (2,1), (1,2) are all within bounds since x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6?

(2,3) not listed, so ok.\n> \n> - D to (2,1): (2,1) not in obstacles, walls are at y=0, so (2,1) is playable.\n> \n> - L to (1,2): but (1,2) is an obstacle, so cannot move there.\n> \n> - R: but cannot because reverse direction not allowed, head dir is L.\n> \n> So only possible actions: U or D.\n> \n> U: (2,3) or D: (2,1)\n> \n> Now, food locations: (3,1), (1,6), (6,3)\n> \n> (3,1) is at x=3,y=1\n> \n> (1,6) at x=1,y=6\n> \n> (6,3) at x=6,y=3\n> \n> Current head at (2,2)\n> \n> If I move U to (2,3), that's not food.\n> \n> If I move D to (2,1), not food.\n> \n> But (3,1) is food, but I'm at (2,2), so to reach (3,1), I need to move down and then right or something.\n> \n> From (2,2), I can only go U or D now.\n> \n> After moving, I can go to other directions.\n> \n> I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n> \n> Also, life span: food at (3,1) has life span 8, meaning it disappears after 8 turns from now? Current turn is 2, life span 8, so it will disappear after turn 2 + 8 = turn 10? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so if not eaten, it disappears after N turns.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span).

Let's clarify.\n> \n> Typically: if life span is N at turn t, it will disappear after N turns, meaning it is there for N more turns. So at turn t, life span N, it will be there until turn t + N - 1, and gone at turn t + N.\n> \n> For example, N=1: present only at turn t, gone at turn t+1.\n> \n> N=2: present at turn t and t+1, gone at turn t+2.\n> \n> So here, turn t=2:\n> \n> (3,1): life span 8, present turns 2 to 9 (8 turns), gone turn 10.\n> \n> (1,6): life span 8, turns 2 to 9, gone turn 10.\n> \n> (6,3): life span 9, turns 2 to 10, gone turn 11.\n> \n> Now, back to current move.\n> \n> I can only move U or D from (2,2).\n> \n> Let's consider both options.\n> \n> First, move U to (2,3).\n> \n> Then snake positions: head to (2,3), tail was at (3,2), but since snake moves, tail moves to where body was? Snake movement: head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead.\n> \n> Current snake: positions [(2,2), (3,2)] so head (2,2), body (3,2).\n> \n> After move, if head moves to (2,3), then the body segment that was at (2,2) moves to where? The body segment follows the head.\n> \n> After head moves to new cell, the tail end moves forward, so the segment that was at (3,2) will move to the previous position of the segment ahead, which was (2,2).\n> \n> Standard snake: when head moves to a new cell, the tail cell is left, and if no food eaten, tail moves, so the segment that was tail is removed, and new head added.\n> \n> Since no food eaten unless on food, so if not on food, snake length same, head moves to new position, tail segment is removed.\n> \n> In this case, from [(2,2), (3,2)], if head moves to (2,3), not food, so new positions: head at (2,3), and the body segment moves to (2,2), so new snake: [(2,3), (2,2)]\n> \n> Similarly, if move D to (2,1), new snake: [(2,1), (2,2)]? Let's see:\n> \n> Head was (2,2) to (2,1), body from (3,2) to (2,2), so [(2,1), (2,2)]\n> \n> Now, after move, head direction changes based on action.\n> \n> But for future moves, I need to know the head direction for no reverse rule.\n> \n> Now, for turn 2, action: U or D.\n> \n> I need to plan 5 turns ahead, so turns 2 to 7 or something.\n> \n> Also, food to consider.\n> \n> (3,1) is close, at (3,1), which is adjacent to (2,1) or (3,2), but (3,2) is current body, so not accessible directly.\n> \n> From (2,2), if I move D to (2,1), then I am at (2,1), and (3,1) is adjacent right.\n> \n> From (2,1), I can move R to (3,1) on next turn, which is food.\n> \n> But let's see if that is safe.\n> \n> First, move to (2,1) on turn 2.\n> \n> Then on turn 3, from (2,1), head direction is D (since I moved down), so I can move U, D, L, but not R? Head direction after move to (2,1) is D (down).\n> \n> After moving down to (2,1), head direction is D.\n> \n> Then possible moves: U (up, to (2,2)), but (2,2) is now the body? Current positions after turn 2 move: if I move D to (2,1), snake is [(2,1), (2,2)]\n> \n> So at turn 3, head at (2,1), direction D.\n> \n> Possible moves:\n> \n> - U: to (2,2), but (2,2) is occupied by body, so collision? Body collision: head touches any body segment.\n> \n> (2,2) is a body segment, so moving to (2,2) would be collision.\n> \n> - D: to (2,0), but y=0 is wall, so wall collision.\n> \n> - L: to (1,1), is that free? x=1,y=1, not wall? Walls: x=0,7 y=0,7, so (1,1) should be playable. Obstacles: (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), but (1,1) not listed, so ok.\n> \n> - R: to (3,1), which is food.\n> \n> And since head direction is D, moving R is right, which is not opposite to down, so allowed. Opposite would be U, but R is perpendicular.\n> \n> So from (2,1) with dir D, I can move L to (1,1) or R to (3,1).\n> \n> Moving U to (2,2) or D to (2,0) both deadly.\n> \n> So only L or R.\n> \n> If I move R to (3,1), it's food, so I eat it, snake grows to length 3.\n> \n> If I move L to (1,1), not food.\n> \n> But (3,1) is food, so I should consider going to it.\n> \n> But there might be risks.\n> \n> First, let's see the tail reward danger.\n> \n> If I eat (3,1), which is positive food, value +1, snake length +1.\n> \n> After eating, snake grows, so new positions.\n> \n> Current before turn 3: snake at [(2,1), (2,2)]\n> \n> Head at (2,1), move R to (3,1), which is food.\n> \n> So after eating, head moves to (3,1), and since food eaten, tail does not move, so new segment added at head, so snake becomes: [(3,1), (2,1), (2,2)]? Positions: the body segments remain, tail stays, head adds new cell.\n> \n> Standard: when food eaten, head moves to food cell, a new segment is added at the tail end, so the tail position remains, and a new segment is created there? No.\n> \n> Typically in snake, when head moves to food, the head occupies the food cell, and the tail does not move, so snake grows by one segment. The positions: the new head is at food, the previous positions are all there, and tail stays.\n> \n> So from [(2,1), (2,2)], head moves to (3,1), so new head at (3,1), and body segments: (2,1) becomes the first body, (2,2) is tail.\n> \n> So snake: [(3,1), (2,1), (2,2)]\n> \n> Length 3.\n> \n> Now, head direction is R (since moved right).\n> \n> Now, possible next moves.\n> \n> But first, is there tail reward danger? Tail reward danger is when head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, but in this case, the tail is at (2,2), and (2,2) does not have food; food was at (3,1) which we just ate. So no issue.\n> \n> Tail reward danger only if the tail cell itself has food that can be eaten, but tail cell is part of snake, so food can't be there unless spawned under, but it was eaten, so no.\n> \n> The rule: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves onto it.\"\n> \n> But here, no food under body now.\n> \n> So safe to eat (3,1).\n> \n> If I do this sequence:\n> \n> Turn 2: move D to (2,1)\n> \n> Turn 3: move R to (3,1) eat food.\n> \n> Now, after that, snake at [(3,1), (2,1), (2,2)]\n> \n> Head at (3,1), direction R.\n> \n> Now, turn 4, possible moves.\n> \n> Head direction R, so cannot move L (left).\n> \n> Possible: U (to (3,2)), D (to (3,0) but y=0 wall), L (not allowed), R (to (4,1))\n> \n> (3,2): is it free?

The snake starts at positions [(2,1), (2,2)] with head at (2,1) and tail at (2,2). The head direction is down, which makes sense because from (2,2) to (2,1) is moving down in y-coordinate (assuming y increases upwards? Wait, no, in the movement constraints, U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), so y=0 is the bottom, y=7 is the top? Let me confirm.\n> \n> In the movement: U (x,y+1) – that means moving up increases y, so y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top. Similarly, D (x,y-1) decreases y, so moving down. Snake positions: head at (2,1), which is x=2, y=1, and previous was (2,2), so from (2,2) to (2,1) is moving down, decreasing y, so direction D is correct.\n> \n> Now, food positions:\n> \n> - (3,1) with life span 7, value 1 (positive food)\n> \n> - (1,6) with life span 7, value 1\n> \n> - (6,3) with life span 8, value 1\n> \n> All food is positive, value 1, so no negative food here. Life spans are given as 7,7,8 for turn t1=3.\n> \n> Life span decreases each turn, including current, so at turn t1=3, food at (3,1) has life span 7, meaning it will disappear after 7 more turns? Let's clarify life span.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span).

When life_span reaches 0, it disappears before the next turn or after? It says \"disappears after N turns\", so if spawned at turn T with life_span N, it disappears at turn T+N. Countdown decreases every turn, so at turn T, life_span=N; turn T+1, life_span=N-1; ... turn T+N-1, life_span=1; at turn T+N, it disappears, I think.\n> \n> But it says \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so for food present at turn t1, life_span is given, and it will decrease each turn.\n> \n> For (3,1), life_span=7 at turn 3, so it will disappear after turn 3+7=10? Let's see: after N turns from now, meaning from current turn.\n> \n> Standard: if life_span is L at turn T, it will be available for L turns, disappearing after turn T+L-1 or something. But to be precise: \"disappears after N turns\", and N=life_span at that turn.\n> \n> Example: at turn t1, life_span=N, then at turn t1, countdown=N; after turn t1, countdown becomes N-1 for turn t1+1; when countdown reaches 0, it disappears before the next turn.\n> \n> I think it's better to think that at the start of each turn, the food has a certain life span, and after the turn, it decreases.\n> \n> But in the input, it's given for current turn t1, so for food at (3,1), at turn 3, life_span=7, meaning after this turn, it will have 6 left, and so on, until life_span=1 at turn 9, and at turn 10 it disappears.\n> \n> Similarly for others.\n> \n> Now, internal obstacles: walls at (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1).

Walls are listed: internal obstacles include (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), but not (1,1). Border walls are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so (1,1) should be free unless it's an obstacle. Obstacles are (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1). So (1,1) is not listed, so it should be free.\n> \n> (1,2) is a wall, so (1,1) is below that, should be ok.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,1): is it a wall? Walls: (3,4) is a wall, but (3,1) not listed, so free.\n> \n> But (3,1) has food!

If I move to (3,1), head at (3,1), and tail is at (2,2), but after move, tail will move to where? When snake moves, head goes to new position, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment in front, so tail moves to where head was, which is (2,1).\n> \n> But since we eat food, length increases, so tail doesn't move? Let's see food mechanics.\n> \n> If I eat positive food, length increases by one, so after eating, the new tail is added, meaning the tail stays in place or something? No.\n> \n> Standard snake: when you eat food, the head moves to the food cell, and a new segment is added where the tail was, so the tail doesn't move that turn; the snake grows.\n> \n> But in terms of positions: after move without eating, head moves to new cell, each body segment shifts, tail cell is vacated.\n> \n> With eating, head moves to food, new segment is added at the previous tail position, so tail doesn't move, and a new position is added.\n> \n> In this case, snake positions: current [(2,1), (2,2)], head (2,1), tail (2,2).\n> \n> If I move to (3,1) and eat food, then new head at (3,1), and since I eat, the tail (2,2) stays, and a new segment is added? No: the snake grows by one, so the body includes the previous head position.\n> \n> After moving and eating: head at new position (3,1), the previous head (2,1) becomes body, and tail (2,2) remains tail, but since length increases, the tail doesn't advance; a new segment is added where the tail was, so positions become [(3,1), (2,1), (2,2)].\n> \n> Yes.\n> \n> Without eating, if I move to a free cell, positions become [new head, previous head], so tail moves to previous head position.\n> \n> But in this case, if I move to (3,1), I eat the food there.\n> \n> Now, is there any danger? Tail reward danger: but here, tail is at (2,2), head moving to (3,1), not adjacent to tail, so no issue.\n> \n> (2,2) and (3,1) are not adjacent; adjacent means sharing a side, so (2,1) and (2,2) are adjacent vertically, (2,1) and (3,1) horizontally, etc.\n> \n> Tail at (2,2), head at (2,1) now, moving to (3,1), which is not adjacent to (2,2); (3,1) is right of (2,1), (2,2) is above, so not adjacent.\n> \n> So safe to eat.\n> \n> But I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n> \n> Other moves: I could move left to (1,1).\n> \n> Or right to (3,1) to eat.\n> \n> Or down, but down to (2,0) is wall, invalid.\n> \n> Cannot move up because reverse direction.\n> \n> Current direction D, so cannot move U.\n> \n> So only possible moves: L to (1,1) or R to (3,1).\n> \n> (1,1) has no food, so moving there just moves without eating.\n> \n> (3,1) has food, eat and grow.\n> \n> But let's see the grid and plan ahead.\n> \n> First, draw the grid mentally.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n> \n> Walls: border x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1)\n> \n> Snake: head (2,1), body (2,2)\n> \n> Food: (3,1), (1,6), (6,3)\n> \n> All value 1.\n> \n> Life spans: at turn 3, (3,1) life 7, so disappears after turn 10?

Walls: internal (4,4) is wall, but (4,1) not listed, border ok, so free? But check obstacles: (4,4) is at y=4, (4,1) at y=1, different, so should be free.\n> \n> But let's list all obstacles to be sure.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1)\n> \n> So (4,1) is clear.\n> \n> Also, U to (3,2): (3,2) is not a wall, no food there.\n> \n> But (3,2) might be free.\n> \n> Now, from (3,1), after moving R, head direction R.\n> \n> Possible moves: U (3,2), R (4,1), cannot move L (left) because that would be opposite to current direction R?

After growth, positions are [(3,1), (2,1), (2,2)], then move head to (3,2), so new head (3,2), previous head (3,1) becomes body, (2,1) body, and tail (2,2) moves to (2,1)? Without eating: head moves to (3,2), body segments: the segment after head was (3,1), so it moves to where head was, but in sequence: positions before move: [head=(3,1), body1=(2,1), body2/tail=(2,2)]\n> \n> After moving head to (3,2), the body segments move: body1 (which was at (2,1)) moves to head's old position (3,1), and tail (2,2) moves to body1's old position (2,1).

It's turn 4. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and internal obstacles at (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1). So, I should sketch a grid to visualize this.\n> \n> Let me make a 8x8 grid since x and y go from 0 to 7.\n> \n> - Walls: borders are all cells where x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Internal obstacles: (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), (3,4), (4,4), (5,2), (5,5), (6,1).\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (3,1), then body at (2,1), and tail at (2,2). So the snake has three segments. Head direction is right, which matches moving from (2,1) to (3,1)? Let's see the positions: [(3,1), (2,1), (2,2)]. Since head is first, and it was moving right to (3,1), so previous position was (2,1), and before that (2,2)? From (2,2) to (2,1) is down, then to (3,1) is right? That might be inconsistent. Head direction is given as R, so current direction is right.\n> \n> Food:\n> \n> - (1,6) with life span 6, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (6,3) with life span 7, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (2,3) with life span 10, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> All food is positive, no negative food here. Life span decreases each turn, including current, so at turn 4:\n> \n> - Food at (1,6): life span 6, so disappears after turn 4 + 6 - 1? Life span decreases every turn including current, so if life span is N at turn t, it disappears after N turns, meaning it lasts for N turns starting from t.\n> \n> Typically, if life span is N at turn t, it will be gone by turn t + N. For example, at turn t, countdown starts, after one turn it's N-1, and so on, until 0, then disappears. But the input says \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So for food at (1,6): life span 6 at turn 4. After turn 4, life span becomes 5, and so on, until turn 4 + 6 - 1 = turn 9, it has life span 1, then after turn 9, it disappears? Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Disappears after N turns\" means it is present for N turns, including the current one. So at turn t, with life span N, it will be there until turn t + N - 1, and gone at turn t + N.\n> \n> For (1,6): life span 6 at turn 4, so present from turn 4 to turn 4 + 5 = turn 9? Turn t to t + N - 1.\n> \n> Standard: if life span N at turn t, it decreases to 0 over N turns, disappearing when countdown reaches 0 after N turns.\n> \n> But the rule says: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> Example: at turn t, life span N. After turn t, countdown is N-1? I think it's better to think: at the start of turn t, life span is S. During turn t, it can be eaten, and at the end of turn t, life span decreases by 1. If it reaches 0 after decrease, it disappears.\n> \n> The input gives life span at current turn, so for food, it has that life span now, and will decrease each turn.\n> \n> For (1,6): life span 6 at turn 4, so after turn 4, it becomes 5, after turn 5 it becomes 4, ..., until after turn 9 it becomes 0 and disappears, so it can be eaten from turn 4 to turn 9 inclusive? Let's see:\n> \n> - Start of turn 4: life span 6\n> \n> - After turn 4: if not eaten, life span 5\n> \n> - After turn 5: 4\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - After turn 9: life span 0, disappears, so not present on turn 10.\n> \n> It can be eaten during turns 4 to 9, since during turn t, life span is S, and after eating or not, S decreases.\n> \n> Similarly for others:\n> \n> (6,3): life span 7 at turn 4, present turns 4 to 10 (since after turn 10 it becomes 0 and disappears)\n> \n> (2,3): life span 10 at turn 4, present turns 4 to 13.\n> \n> Now, snake: head at (3,1), body at (2,1), tail at (2,2). Head direction R, so it moved right to (3,1) from (2,1).\n> \n> Possible moves: since head is at (3,1), direction R, so it can move U, D, L, R, but no instant reverse, so cannot move left (opposite of right). Current direction is R, so cannot move L immediately.\n> \n> Possible moves from (3,1):\n> \n> - U: (3,2)\n> \n> - D: (3,0) but y=0 is wall, so invalid\n> \n> - L: (2,1) but (2,1) is body, but is it safe? (2,1) is the body segment, but when snake moves, the tail will move, so moving to (2,1) might be possible if the tail leaves.\n> \n> Collision rule: body collision if head touches any body segment except that the tail cell is safe to enter because the tail moves.\n> \n> Specifically: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, moving to a body segment is deadly unless it is the tail segment and the tail moves away.\n> \n> In this case, (2,1) is the second segment, not the tail; tail is at (2,2). So moving to (2,1) would be collision with body, deadly.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,1) is head, so adjacent cells:\n> \n> - North: (3,2)\n> \n> - South: (3,0) which is wall, invalid\n> \n> - West: (2,1) which is body (segment 1), not tail, so collision if moved to\n> \n> - East: (4,1)\n> \n> Now, (4,1): is it wall or free? Walls: borders are x=0 or x=7, y=0 or y=7, so (4,1) is x=4,y=1, not border. Internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1). None of these is (4,1), so (4,1) is free.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,2): not border, not in internal obstacles list. Internal obstacles: (5,2), but (3,2) not listed, so free.\n> \n> (2,1) is occupied by body, so cannot move there.\n> \n> So possible moves:\n> \n> - U to (3,2)\n> \n> - R to (4,1)\n> \n> D to (3,0) is wall, invalid.\n> \n> L to (2,1) is body, deadly.\n> \n> So only U or R.\n> \n> Now, food locations: (1,6), (6,3), (2,3)\n> \n> (2,3) is close to snake, at (2,3).\n> \n> Snake head at (3,1), so (2,3) is at row 3, column 2? (x,y) so (2,3) is x=2,y=3.\n> \n> Grid: x horizontal, y vertical? Usually in coordinates, x is horizontal, y vertical, so (x,y).\n> \n> So head at (3,1), food at (2,3) which is left and up? From (3,1), (2,3) is west and north, so not adjacent directly; adjacent cells are (3,2), (4,1), (3,0) invalid, (2,1) invalid.\n> \n> (2,3) is two cells away: from (3,1) to (2,3) is not adjacent; Manhattan distance |3-2| + |1-3| =1 +2=3, so not adjacent.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,6) is far, (6,3) is also far.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan 5+ turns ahead to maximize score, prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> First, let's list all possible moves and consequences.\n> \n> Option 1: Move Up to (3,2)\n> \n> Then head at (3,2), body follows: previous head (3,1) becomes body, so snake: [(3,2), (3,1), (2,1)] and tail at (2,1)? Positions: new head (3,2), then the segment that was head is now body at (3,1), then the next body at (2,1), and tail was (2,2) but when snake moves, the tail moves to the previous position of the last body segment? Standard snake movement: when head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead.\n> \n> So current positions: index 0: head (3,1), 1: body (2,1), 2: tail (2,2)\n> \n> After move U to (3,2):\n> \n> - New head: (3,2)\n> \n> - Segment 0 moves to new head, but it's replaced; better to think: the head moves to (3,2), so new positions: head at (3,2), then the previous head (3,1) is now the first body segment, then the previous first body (2,1) is now the second body, and the tail (2,2) is left, but since the snake moves, the tail is removed only if no food eaten; since no food eaten, tail moves? When no food, tail is removed, but positions shift.\n> \n> When snake moves without eating, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so the last position (tail) is vacated.\n> \n> So after move U to (3,2):\n> \n> - Head moves to (3,2)\n> \n> - Body segment 1 (which was at (2,1)) moves to where head was, (3,1)\n> \n> - Body segment 2 (which was at (2,2)) moves to where segment 1 was, (2,1)\n> \n> So new snake positions: head (3,2), body (3,1), body (2,1) — tail is at (2,1), so positions [(3,2), (3,1), (2,1)]\n> \n> Tail is at (2,1).\n> \n> Now, from (3,2), possible moves.\n> \n> Current direction: moved up, so direction now U? Head direction for next move: since moved U, direction is U, so cannot move D (down) next turn.\n> \n> Possible moves from (3,2):\n> \n> - U to (3,3)\n> \n> - D to (3,1) but (3,1) is now body segment, and it's not the tail? Tail is at (2,1), (3,1) is the second segment, so moving to (3,1) would collide with body.\n> \n> - L to (2,2)\n> \n> - R to (4,2)\n> \n> Now, (3,1) is occupied, so invalid to move there.\n> \n> (2,2): is it free? Previous tail was at (2,2), but after move, it moved to (2,1), so (2,2) is empty now? Let's see: before move, positions were (3,1), (2,1), (2,2). After move U, new positions: (3,2), (3,1), (2,1). So cell (2,2) is now free, since tail moved.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,2) should be free.\n> \n> Check walls: (2,2) not border, not internal obstacle (internal: (1,2) but not (2,2), so free.\n> \n> (4,2): not border, internal obstacles: (5,2) is wall, (4,2) not listed, so free.\n> \n> (3,3): not border, internal: (3,4) is wall, but (3,3) not listed, so free.\n> \n> So from (3,2), possible moves: U to (3,3), L to (2,2), R to (4,2).

The snake is moving right (R).\n- **Possible Moves**:\n  - **U (Up)**: (4,2) \n    - Check: Not a wall, not an internal obstacle, not occupied by the snake's body (except the tail, but the tail is at (2,1)). \n    - Valid.\n  - **D (Down)**: (4,0) \n    - Check: y=0 is a wall. \n    - Invalid.\n  - **L (Left)**: (3,1) \n    - Check: Occupied by the body (not the tail). Moving here would cause the head to collide with the body segment at (3,1) after the move (since the tail moves to (3,1)). \n    - Invalid (collision).\n  - **R (Right)**: (5,1) \n    - Check: Not a wall, not an internal obstacle (internal obstacles are at (5,2), (6,1), etc., but (5,1) is free). \n    - However, moving to (5,1) leads to a dead end: from (5,1), the only possible move is U to (5,2), but (5,2) is an internal obstacle. Thus, moving R would trap the snake. \n    - Invalid (dead end).\n\n### Valid Moves\nFrom the above, the only valid and safe move is **U (Up) to (4,2)**. \n\n### Why Not Other Moves?\n- **R (Right) to (5,1)**: As analyzed, this leads to a dead end where the snake cannot move further without colliding or hitting a wall/obstacle. This is suicidal and must be avoided.\n- **L (Left) to (3,1)**: This causes an immediate collision with the body segment at (3,1), as the tail would move to (3,1) after the move, resulting in the head and tail occupying the same cell.\n- **D (Down) to (4,0)**: This is a wall collision and is invalid.\n\n### Guidance from Previous Thinking Model\nThe previous thinking model also concluded that the only safe and viable move is **U (Up)**. It further planned a sequence to reach the food at (6,3) by:\n1. Moving U to (4,2) on Turn 5.\n2. Moving U to (4,3) on Turn 6.\n3. Moving R to (5,3) on Turn 7.\n4. Moving R to (6,3) to eat the food on Turn 8.\n5. Moving U to (6,4) on Turn 9 to avoid the dead end at (6,2).\n\nThis sequence is safe and maximizes the score by reaching the positive food at (6,3) while avoiding risks.\n\n### Immediate Action for Turn 5\nGiven the analysis, the immediate action for Turn 5 must be **U (Up)** to (4,2). This is the only move that avoids collisions, dead ends, and keeps the snake safe while allowing future movement options.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\boxed{U}",
        "state": "**Current Turn**: \\( t_0 = 5 \\)\n**Cells occupied by walls**:\n\t - Border Cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7.\n\t - Internal Obstacles: [(5, 2), (4, 4), (1, 2), (1, 5), (1, 4), (3, 4), (5, 5), (6, 1)]\n**Snake Positions**:[(4, 1), (3, 1), (2, 1)]\n**Snake Head Direction**: R\n**Food Positions, Life Span and Value**:\n\t- (1, 6, 5, 1)\n\t- (6, 3, 6, 1)\n\t- (2, 3, 9, 1)\n> **Guidance from a Previous Thinking Model:** Turn \\( t_1 = 5 \\)\n> <think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 5, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid is from (0,0) to (7,7), with walls on the borders.\n> \n> Internal obstacles are at: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1). So these cells are blocked and I can't move there.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (4,1), then body at (3,1), and tail at (2,1). So the snake is horizontal, facing right (east), from left to right: (2,1) - (3,1) - (4,1). Head direction is R, which is right, so moving east.\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (1,6) with value 1, life span 5\n> \n> - (6,3) with value 1, life span 6\n> \n> - (2,3) with value 1, life span 9\n> \n> All food has value +1, so they're all positive food. No negative food mentioned.\n> \n> Life span: for (1,6), life span 5, meaning it disappears after 5 turns, including current turn. Since current turn is 5, it will disappear after turn 5? Let me clarify the life span countdown.\n> \n> The problem says: \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So for food at (1,6) with life span 5 on turn 5: it will disappear after turn 5 + 5 - 1? No.\n> \n> If life span is N, and it appears at some turn, it disappears after N turns, including the turn it was spawned or when countdown starts.\n> \n> But here, it's given at turn 5 with life span 5, so it must have been spawned earlier. The life span is the remaining life.\n> \n> For example, (1,6) has life span 5 at turn 5, so it will disappear after 5 more turns? Let's read carefully.\n> \n> \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" so on turn t, if life span is L, after turn t, L decreases by 1, and when L reaches 0, it disappears.\n> \n> Standard way: at the start of turn t, if food has life span L, it will be there for L turns, including turn t. So after L turns, it's gone.\n> \n> For (1,6): life span 5 at turn 5, so it will be present on turns 5,6,7,8,9, and disappear after turn 9 (or at the start of turn 10?).\n> \n> Similarly, (6,3): life span 6 at turn 5, so turns 5 to 10.\n> \n> (2,3): life span 9, turns 5 to 13.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan an action sequence for at least 5 turns ahead, but since I have to think 5+ turns, I should plan a sequence of actions.\n> \n> The action sequence should be for turns starting from current turn t1=5.\n> \n> Also, I must avoid risks and prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> First, let's sketch the grid.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls at borders, so I can only be in (1,1) to (6,6)? No, borders are walls, so cells like (0,0) are walls, but I can be at (1,1), etc. Since walls occupy cells, I can't move to x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So playable area is x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? Let's confirm.\n> \n> \"Cells occupied by walls: Border cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7.\" So any cell with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 is a wall cell. Also internal obstacles.\n> \n> So the grid: rows and columns from 0 to 7.\n> \n> Playable cells: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except where internal obstacles are.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1)\n> \n> List them:\n> \n> - (1,2)\n> \n> - (1,4)\n> \n> - (1,5)\n> \n> - (3,4)\n> \n> - (4,4)\n> \n> - (5,2)\n> \n> - (5,5)\n> \n> - (6,1)\n> \n> Snake: head (4,1), body (3,1), tail (2,1).

But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, if I move to a cell that will be vacated by the tail, it's safe.\n> \n> Currently, snake positions: [(4,1), (3,1), (2,1)] so head at (4,1), tail at (2,1).\n> \n> If I move left to (3,1), which is currently occupied by the body, but after the move, the snake will move: head to new position, each segment follows.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, and the tail is left, so if head moves to where tail is, since tail moves away, no collision.\n> \n> In this case:\n> \n> - If I move L to (3,1): (3,1) is currently the body segment. After move, head goes to (3,1), but (3,1) was occupied, but since the body will move, the segment that was at (3,1) will move to where head was? Let's think.\n> \n> Sequence: head is at (4,1). If I move left to (3,1), which is currently occupied by the first body segment.\n> \n> After move: head moves to (3,1). The body segment that was at (3,1) must move to where the head was, which is (4,1), but (4,1) is now empty? Positions: before move: head (4,1), segment1 (3,1), segment2 (2,1) tail.\n> \n> After moving left: head to (3,1). Then segment1 (which was at (3,1)) moves to the previous head position (4,1). Then segment2 (tail at (2,1)) moves to the previous position of segment1, which was (3,1).\n> \n> So new positions: head at (3,1), body at (4,1), tail at (3,1)? No: head to (3,1), then body segment that was at (3,1) moves to (4,1), and tail from (2,1) moves to (3,1). So positions: [(3,1), (4,1), (3,1)]? Head at (3,1), then body at (4,1), but tail moved to (3,1), which is same as head? That would be collision.\n> \n> I think I confused.\n> \n> Standard: the head moves to a new cell. Then each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> So positions list: index 0 head, 1 body1, 2 body2/tail.\n> \n> Before move: pos[0] = (4,1), pos[1] = (3,1), pos[2] = (2,1)\n> \n> After move left: new head position is (3,1). Then, the body segments: segment1 (index 1) moves to where head was, (4,1). Segment2 (index 2, tail) moves to where segment1 was, (3,1).\n> \n> But now head is at (3,1), and tail moves to (3,1), so at the end, head and tail are both at (3,1), which is a collision.\n> \n> But the rule says: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> In this case, the tail was at (2,1), and I move head to (3,1), which is where the body was, not directly to tail.\n> \n> The key point is moving to the cell that the tail is leaving, but here I'm moving to a body cell, not the tail cell.\n> \n> Specifically, moving to the tail cell is safe if it's adjacent and tail moves away.\n> \n> But moving to a body cell that is not the tail is unsafe.\n> \n> In this case, (3,1) is the body segment, not the tail. Tail is at (2,1).\n> \n> So if I move to (3,1), which is occupied by body, it will cause collision because after move, head is at (3,1), and then the tail moves to (3,1), but since it's the same cell, collision.\n> \n> Moreover, during the move, head touches body segment at (3,1).\n> \n> So generally, moving to any cell occupied by snake except the tail cell is dangerous.\n> \n> But for tail cell, it might be safe if tail moves away.\n> \n> In this position: possible moves from (4,1):\n> \n> - U: to (4,2) - is this free?

After eating, moving up on turn 9 ensures long-term survival by steering clear of the risky (6,2) dead end. The closer food at (2,3) is de-prioritized due to its longer life span, allowing it to be pursued later if possible.\n",

Playable area: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6 except obstacles.\n> \n> Blocked cells:\n> \n> - Border: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 — all these cells are walls.\n> \n> - Internal: (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), (3,4), (4,4), (5,2), (5,5), (6,1)\n> \n> Also, snake occupies (5,3), (4,3), (4,2) — but (4,2) is an obstacle? (4,2) is the tail, but it's also listed as an internal obstacle? No, internal obstacles are separate. Let's see.\n> \n> Internal obstacles are given as: [(5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1)]\n> \n> And snake is at [(5,3), (4,3), (4,2)]\n> \n> So (4,2) is occupied by snake tail, and (5,2) is an obstacle, different cell.\n> \n> (5,2) is obstacle, (4,2) is snake tail.\n> \n> Now, for current position (5,3), head.\n> \n> Possible moves from (5,3):\n> \n> - R: to (6,3) — is this valid? (6,3) is within x=1-6, y=1-6? x=6, y=3, x=6 is not wall? Walls are x=0 and x=7, so x=6 is ok, y=3 is ok. But is there obstacle or body?\n> \n> (6,3) has food, but let's check if it's blocked.\n> \n> First, walls: x=6 is not x=0 or x=7, so not border wall. y=3 not y=0 or y=7.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (6,1) is obstacle, but (6,3) is not listed, so not obstacle.\n> \n> Snake: snake is at (5,3), (4,3), (4,2), so (6,3) is not occupied by snake body.\n> \n> Therefore, (6,3) is free, and has food with value 1.\n> \n> - U: to (5,4) — (5,4) is x=5,y=4. Not border. Internal obstacles? (5,5) is obstacle, but (5,4) not listed. Snake? Not occupied. So free? But is there food? Food at (1,6),(6,3),(2,3),(1,3), not (5,4), so no food, just empty.\n> \n> - D: to (5,2) — (5,2) is an internal obstacle! From the list: (5,2) is obstacle, so cannot move there, collision.\n> \n> So from (5,3), possible moves: R to (6,3), U to (5,4), D to (5,2) but (5,2) obstacle, so invalid. Only R and U are possible? D is to (5,2), which is blocked.\n> \n> Coordinates: from (5,3), D is down, y decreases, so (5,2). Yes, (5,2) is in obstacle list.\n> \n> L is left, to (4,3), but (4,3) is the body segment, not tail. Head is at (5,3), body is (4,3), so moving L to (4,3) would be body collision, since it's not the tail; only tail can be moved into if it moves away.\n> \n> Currently, tail is at (4,2), not (4,3).\n> \n> If I move L to (4,3), that's where the body is, and since body doesn't move away immediately, it would collide. Rule: head touches any body segment except when moving to tail and tail moves.\n> \n> But (4,3) is not the tail; tail is (4,2). So moving to (4,3) would be collision.\n> \n> Therefore, only possible moves from (5,3) are R to (6,3) or U to (5,4).\n> \n> D to (5,2) is obstacle, L to (4,3) is body collision.\n> \n> So actions for turn 8: R or U.\n> \n> Now, I need to think ahead 5+ turns.\n> \n> First, let's list the food and their deadlines:\n> \n> - (1,6): must be eaten by turn 9 (since life span 2, disappears after turn 9)\n> \n> - (6,3): must be eaten by turn 10 (life span 3, disappears after turn 10)\n> \n> - (2,3): must be eaten by turn 13 (life span 6)\n> \n> - (1,3): must be eaten by turn 16 (life span 9)\n> \n> Snake is at (5,3), and (6,3) is adjacent to the right, with food that expires in 3 turns, so it can be eaten now.\n> \n> But I need to consider the risks.\n> \n> If I eat (6,3), the snake grows to length 4. After eating, head moves to (6,3), and a new segment is added, so snake becomes [(6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,2)] for the next state, but when head moves to (6,3), the body follows, so positions: head to (6,3), then the previous head (5,3) becomes body, and so on, tail (4,2) stays until move, but when head moves, the tail moves forward only if no growth, but if food eaten, tail doesn't move, new segment added.\n> \n> Rule: when eating positive food, length increases by one, so tail doesn't move; new segment added where tail was? No.\n> \n> Standard snake: when head moves to food, it grows, so the new head is at food, and the tail stays, so length increases.\n> \n> Positions: after moving to food, head is at new position, the previous positions remain, and tail doesn't advance.\n> \n> For example, current snake: positions [(5,3), (4,3), (4,2)]\n> \n> If head moves R to (6,3), which has food, so snake grows to length 4.\n> \n> New positions: head at (6,3), then the body segments: (5,3) is now body, (4,3) is body, and (4,2) is still tail? No: the segments are: new head (6,3), then the previous head (5,3) becomes neck, then (4,3) becomes body, and (4,2) is tail. But since length increases, we add a new segment at the end, so tail stays at (4,2) for now? I think I'm confusing.\n> \n> Standard behavior: when snake eats, the head moves to the food cell, and a new segment is added at the tail position, so the tail doesn't move. So the snake extends by one cell at the tail end.\n> \n> So before move: segments: 0: head (5,3), 1: body (4,3), 2: tail (4,2)\n> \n> After moving head to (6,3) and eating, new segments: head (6,3), then body (5,3), then body (4,3), and new tail at (4,2) — but (4,2) was tail, now it's still there, and we add a new segment? No.\n> \n> Typically, the tail position doesn't change when eating; the new segment is added, so the tail stays fixed, and we have an additional segment.\n> \n> Initial: positions S = [H, B, T] where H is head, B is body, T is tail.\n> \n> After moving to a free cell: head moves to new position, say H', then S' = [H', H, B] and tail T is removed, so positions [H', H, B] but B was body, now it's tail.\n> \n> In this case, from [ (5,3), (4,3), (4,2) ], move to free cell, say (6,3) no food, then new head (6,3), body (5,3), and tail (4,3) — (4,2) is left, and tail becomes (4,3).\n> \n> But (4,2) was tail, now it's empty.\n> \n> If move to food, say (6,3) with food, then head moves to (6,3), body (5,3), body (4,3), and tail (4,2) — so we keep the tail, length increases to 4.\n> \n> Yes.\n> \n> So after eating (6,3), snake becomes: head (6,3), body (5,3), body (4,3), tail (4,2). So positions: [(6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,2)]\n> \n> Now, head at (6,3), direction after move is R (since we moved right).\n> \n> Now, from there, possible moves.\n> \n> But first, let's consider the choice for turn 8.\n> \n> Option 1: Move R to (6,3), eat food, snake grows to 4.\n> \n> Then head at (6,3), direction R.\n> \n> Possible next moves: from (6,3), x=6, y=3.\n> \n> Possible: U to (6,4), D to (6,2), L to (5,3), but L is left, opposite to current direction R? After moving R, the new direction is R, so for next turn, cannot move L (opposite).\n> \n> Also, check cells:\n> \n> - U: (6,4) - not border, x=6<7, y=4<7, not obstacle? Obstacles: (6,1) is obstacle, but (6,4) not listed, so free? But y=4, x=6.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (5,5),(5,2), etc., not (6,4), so (6,4) should be free.\n> \n> - D: (6,2) - (6,2) not in obstacles, but (6,1) is obstacle, (6,2) is y=2, should be free? But let's list all obstacles.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), (3,4), (4,4), (5,2), (5,5), (6,1)\n> \n> So (6,2) is not listed, so free.\n> \n> - L: (5,3) - but (5,3) is now a body segment! After move, snake is at [(6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,2)], so (5,3) is body, not tail. Moving to (5,3) would be body collision, since it's not the tail. Tail is at (4,2).\n> \n> Also, L is opposite direction, so not allowed anyway.\n> \n> So from (6,3), after moving R, direction R, possible moves: U to (6,4), D to (6,2), R to (7,3) but x=7 is wall, so invalid. So only U or D.\n> \n> Now, (6,4): free, no food.\n> \n> (6,2): free, no food.\n> \n> But if I go U to (6,4), then from there, I might go left or up, etc.\n> \n> But I need to think about other food.\n> \n> (1,6) is about to expire, must be eaten by turn 9.\n> \n> From (6,3), it's far, (1,6) is at x=1,y=6.\n> \n> Distance: |6-1| + |3-6| = 5 + 3 = 8 cells, but snake moves one per turn, so at least 8 turns, but (1,6) expires after turn 9, so only 2 turns left: turn 8 and 9. After turn 9 it disappears. Turn 8 is now, turn 9 next.\n> \n> But snake is at (6,3), to reach (1,6) in 2 turns is impossible, min distance 8 cells. So (1,6) cannot be reached in time from here; it will disappear after turn 9.\n> \n> Similarly, from current position (5,3), if I don't eat (6,3), I could move U to (5,4), but (5,4) is empty, no food.\n> \n> Then from there, I might go towards other food.\n> \n> But (1,6) is too far to reach in time, since turn 8 and 9 only.\n> \n> Let's calculate: current turn 8.\n> \n> (1,6) can be eaten on turn 8 or 9.\n> \n> Snake head at (5,3).\n> \n> To reach (1,6): delta x = -4, delta y = +3, so min 7 moves, but in 2 turns, impossible. So (1,6) is unreachable and will disappear; we should ignore it for planning.\n> \n> Similarly, other food: (6,3) is close, can be eaten now.\n> \n> (2,3) at (2,3), which is left, same y, x=2.\n> \n> From (5,3) to (2,3) is |5-2|=3 cells left, so 3 turns min, but with obstacles.\n> \n> (1,3) at (1,3), similar.\n> \n> But (6,3) is immediate.\n> \n> If I don't eat (6,3), it will be there for 3 turns, so I can eat it later.\n> \n> But there might be risks.\n> \n> Another thing: the food at (1,3) has long life, but there is an obstacle at (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), so row y=1 has obstacles, but (1,3) is food, and it's not obstacle, so it should be accessible.\n> \n> But let's think about the path.\n> \n> I need to plan a sequence.\n> \n> Also, there is a rule about \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because of collision.\n> \n> But currently, tail is at (4,2), head at (5,3), not adjacent. Adjacent would be same x or y differ by 1.\n> \n> (5,3) and (4,2): |5-4|=1, |3-2|=1, so diagonal, not adjacent; adjacent means sharing a side, so up, down, left, right.\n> \n> So (5,3) adjacent cells: (5,4), (5,2), (6,3), (4,3).\n> \n> Tail is at (4,2), which is not adjacent to head; (4,2) is down-left, not sharing side.

It's turn 9. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and internal obstacles at (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1). So, I should sketch a grid to visualize this.\n> \n> The grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls block those cells. Internal obstacles are specific cells that are blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (6,3), then (5,3), (4,3), (4,2). So the snake has 4 segments. Head direction is right, meaning it was moving to the right to reach (6,3) from (5,3), I assume.\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (1,6) with value 1, life span 1 (so it disappears after this turn if not eaten?)\n> \n> Life span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 9, life span 1 means it will disappear after turn 9? Let me clarify the life span rule.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So, if life span is given as 1 at turn 9, that means after this turn (turn 9), it will disappear. Because countdown decreases every turn, including current. So on turn 9, if not eaten, it vanishes.\n> \n> Similarly, for (2,3): value 1, life span 5, so it will disappear after turn 13? Let's see: at turn 9, life span 5, so it has 5 turns left including turn 9. After turn 9, life span becomes 4, and so on, until life span 0 after turn 13? I need to be careful.\n> \n> The countdown decreases every turn. At the start of turn t, the life span is L. After the turn, if not eaten, it decreases to L-1. When L reaches 0, it disappears.\n> \n> For food at (1,6): life span 1 at turn 9. So on turn 9, if not eaten, after turn 9, life span becomes 0, and it disappears. So it can only be eaten on turn 9, or not at all.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,3): life span 5 at turn 9, so it will disappear after turn 13? After turn 9, life span 4; turn 10, life span 3; ... turn 13, life span 0 after the turn, so it disappears after turn 13. So it can be eaten from turn 9 to 13.\n> \n> Turn 13 is the last chance to eat it.\n> \n> (1,3): life span 8 at turn 9, so disappears after turn 16.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (6,3), direction right. Possible moves: since head direction is right, I can go up (U), down (D), or right (R), but not left (L) because that would be instant reverse, which is not allowed. \"No instant reverse\": cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn. Current direction is R, so opposite is L, so I cannot move left.\n> \n> So from (6,3), possible moves:\n> \n> - U: (6,4)\n> \n> - D: (6,2)\n> \n> - R: (7,3)\n> \n> But walls: border x=7 is wall, so (7,3) is wall, cannot go there.\n> \n> Also, internal obstacles: (6,1) is obstacle, but (6,2) is not listed, so should be free?

Let me clarify: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so if life span is N at turn t, it will disappear after N turns, so at turn t + N, it's gone. For example, at turn 10, life span 5, it will be there until turn 14, and gone on turn 15.

What is there? (6,5) has food with value 1, life span 10. So if I move to (6,5), I eat the food, snake grows to length 5, and new head position (6,5). Then tail moves, so tail at (4,3) moves away, but since I ate food, a new segment is added, so positions become: head (6,5), then (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), and tail was (4,3), but since I ate, new tail is (4,3) or? When snake eats, it grows, so the tail doesn't move that turn; the new segment is added at the head position after move, but since head moves to food, it eats, so snake length increases by one, and the body segments remain, so new positions: head at (6,5), then previous head (6,4) becomes body, then (6,3), (5,3), and (4,3) remains, but since length increases, a new segment is added.

It's turn 12, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid (since x and y go from 0 to 7, so 8 cells in each direction). Walls are on the borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are all walls. Also, there are internal obstacles at: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1). I should list all obstacles to avoid them.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (5,3), then (5,4), (6,4), (6,3). So the snake has 4 segments. Head direction is down (D), which means it was moving down to (5,3) from (5,4)? Let's see: positions are [(5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3)]. Since head is first, and direction is D, that means from previous position, it moved down to (5,3). But (5,4) is the second segment, which was the head before moving down. Let me sketch this.\n> \n> Assume y increases upwards? No, in grid coordinates, typically y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top, but in the movement, U is (x,y+1), which might imply y+1 is up if y=0 is bottom. But in the state, it doesn't specify, but from walls, y=0 and y=7 are borders, so probably y=0 is bottom row, y=7 is top row, so U (y+1) means moving up, D (y-1) means moving down.\n> \n> In snake positions: head at (5,3), then body at (5,4), (6,4), (6,3). Since head direction is D, it was moving down to (5,3), so from (5,4) to (5,3). Then the body: from (5,4) to (6,4)?

Positions: head (2,3), then body: previous head position? After head moves to (2,3), the body: seg1 moves to (3,3), seg2 moves to (4,3), seg3 moves to (5,3), and since eaten, add new segment at previous tail position? Standard snake: when eat, head moves to food, body follows, but tail stays, so snake grows by one.\n> \n> So before move: snake H(3,3), B1(4,3), B2(5,3), T(5,4)\n> \n> Move head to (2,3), eat food. Then, new positions: head (2,3), then the first body segment moves to previous head position (3,3), second body to previous first body (4,3), tail to previous second body (5,3), and since eaten, a new segment is added at the previous tail position (5,4)? No.\n> \n> Typically: the body segments shift: each segment moves to the position of the previous one.\n> \n> After head moves to new position, each subsequent segment moves to where the previous segment was.\n> \n> So before move: positions: index 0: (3,3), index 1: (4,3), index 2: (5,3), index 3: (5,4)\n> \n> Head moves to (2,3).\n> \n> Then, index 1 (body) moves to where index 0 was, which is (3,3)\n> \n> Index 2 moves to where index 1 was, (4,3)\n> \n> Index 3 (tail) moves to where index 2 was, (5,3)\n> \n> Since food eaten, a new segment is added at the position where the tail was before moving, which is (5,4).

Minimum distance: |dx|=4, |dy|=1, so at least 4 moves, but I have only turn 13 and 14, so I can be at (2,3) at earliest turn 15, but food disappears after turn 14, so not present on turn 15.

And borders are walls, so any cell with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 is a wall.\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (4,3), then body segments at (5,3), (5,4), (6,4). So the snake is three segments long: head, and two body parts, but positions are given as list: [(4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4)]. That's four positions: head at (4,3), next at (5,3), then (5,4), then tail at (6,4).

Let's see: at turn 13, life_span=4. After turn 13, it becomes 3; turn 14, becomes 2; turn 15, becomes 1; turn 16, becomes 0 and disappears. So available from turn 13 to 16.\n> \n> Turn 16: if eaten on turn 16, before it disappears.\n> \n> But life span decreases each turn, so when life_span reaches 0, it disappears at the end of that turn or something?

But to be precise.\n> \n> Assume that at the beginning of turn T, the food is present if life_span > 0. After the snake moves and eats, if head moves to food, it eats it, then the food is removed. Life span decreases after the turn, I think.\n> \n> The rule: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> But it doesn't specify when exactly. To avoid confusion, let's interpret as: at the start of each turn, before the snake moves, the life span is decreased by 1 for each food. If life span becomes 0, it disappears and cannot be eaten that turn.\n> \n> But the rule says \"including current\", so for turn 13, with life_span=2, it means at turn 13, life_span is 2; after turn 13, it becomes 1 for turn 14, and so on.\n> \n> When can it be eaten? On turn 13, life_span is 2, so it can be eaten on this turn or next, but not on turn 15.\n> \n> Similarly, for (1,3): life_span=4 at turn 13, so can be eaten on turns 13,14,15,16.\n> \n> Turn 16: if eaten on turn 16, life_span decreases to 0 after, so it should be available on turn 16 if life_span was >0 at start.\n> \n> I think it's safe to assume that food can be eaten on any turn as long as its life_span at the start of the turn is at least 1, and after eating, it's removed.\n> \n> But let's not overcomplicate; for now, I'll note the expiration.\n> \n> (2,3): expires after turn 14 (since life_span=2 at turn 13, so last chance to eat is turn 14)\n> \n> (1,3): life_span=4, expires after turn 16\n> \n> (6,5): life_span=7, expires after turn 19\n> \n> (5,6): life_span=10, expires after turn 22\n> \n> All value 1.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (4,3), moving left.\n> \n> Possible moves from (4,3):\n> \n> - Left (L): to (3,3)\n> \n> - Up (U): to (4,4)\n> \n> - Down (D): to (4,2)\n> \n> But (4,4) is an internal obstacle!

No.\n> \n> When snake eats food, it grows, so the tail stays in place for this turn. Standard snake: when you eat, the head moves to food, and a new segment is added, so the tail doesn't move.

Since we eat, we add a segment at the tail, but the tail doesn't move, so positions become [ (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4) ] and the tail is still (5,4), but now there are 6 segments, with tail at (5,4).\n> \n> In terms of collision, the body includes all segments except the head.\n> \n> But in this case, (1,3) is new head, and (2,3) is now body, but it was head, so it's fine.\n> \n> Now, is moving to (1,3) safe? (1,3) has food, so eating it.\n> \n> But there's a special case: \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and newly grown tail collide.\n> \n> Here, tail is at (5,4), head is at (2,3), which is not adjacent to tail. Adjacent means sharing a side, so (2,3) and (5,4) are not adjacent; (2,3) to (5,4) is distance |2-5| + |3-4| = 3+1=4, not 1. So no issue.\n> \n> Also, (1,3) itself: is it under snake body? No, snake body is all at y=3 or (5,4), not (1,3).\n> \n> So moving to (1,3) seems safe for this turn.\n> \n> But I need to think ahead. If I eat (1,3), snake grows to length 6, and head at (1,3).\n> \n> Then from there, possible moves: since I moved left to (1,3), direction is L, so next turn I can go L, U, or D, but L to (0,3) is wall, since x=0 is border wall. So L not possible.\n> \n> U to (1,4), but (1,4) is an internal obstacle! From the list: internal obstacles include (1,4), so (1,4) is blocked.\n> \n> D to (1,2), but (1,2) is also an internal obstacle, listed.\n> \n> So from (1,3), after eating, I can only move U, D, or L, but L to (0,3) wall, U to (1,4) obstacle, D to (1,2) obstacle. So no possible moves! I would be trapped and die next turn.\n> \n> That's bad. So if I go to (1,3) now, I eat the food, but then I have no escape, because all adjacent cells are walls or obstacles.\n> \n> Adjacent cells to (1,3):\n> \n> - Left: (0,3) wall\n> \n> - Up: (1,4) obstacle\n> \n> - Down: (1,2) obstacle\n> \n> - Right: (2,3) which is now body, since after move, (2,3) is part of the body.\n> \n> After moving to (1,3), positions: head (1,3), body (2,3), (3,3), etc., so (2,3) is occupied by body, so I can't move back right.\n> \n> Therefore, from (1,3), no safe moves; any move would be into wall, obstacle, or body. So I would die on turn 16.\n> \n> Therefore, going to (1,3) is suicidal. I must avoid that.\n> \n> So action L is not good.\n> \n> Now, other actions from current position (2,3): U or D.\n> \n> U to (2,4)\n> \n> D to (2,2)\n> \n> First, check if they are safe.\n> \n> (2,4): is it free? Snake body: (3,3),(4,3),(5,3),(5,4) all different. Obstacles: internal obstacles include (1,4), (1,5), (3,4), (4,4), etc., but (2,4) not listed, so should be free. Walls: y=7 is top, but (2,4) y=4<7, so ok.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,2): not in snake body, not in obstacles list (obstacles have (1,2), but (2,2) not listed), not wall.\n> \n> So both U and D are possible.\n> \n> Now, food: no food at (2,4) or (2,2), so no eating, just move.\n> \n> If I go U to (2,4), then snake moves: head to (2,4), body follows: (2,3) becomes body, then (3,3), etc., tail (5,4) moves to where? After move without eating, tail moves.\n> \n> Current positions: [ (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4) ]\n> \n> After moving head to (2,4): new head (2,4), then body: (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), and tail: since no eat, tail moves off (5,4), but where? The segment that was at (5,3) moves to (5,4)? Let's see.\n> \n> When snake moves without eating, head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the next position, tail leaves its position.\n> \n> So from [H: (2,3), B1: (3,3), B2: (4,3), B3: (5,3), T: (5,4)]\n> \n> After moving head to (2,4): new positions: H: (2,4), B1: (2,3) (previous head), B2: (3,3) (previous B1), B3: (4,3) (previous B2), T: (5,3) (previous B3). Since tail was (5,4), it is removed, and B3 (5,3) becomes new tail.\n> \n> Positions: head (2,4), then (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3). Tail at (5,3).\n> \n> Similarly, if move down to (2,2): head (2,2), body (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), tail at (5,3) since (5,4) is gone.\n> \n> Now, after moving, direction changes. If I go U, new direction is U; if D, new direction is D.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan multiple turns.\n> \n> Also, there are other food: (6,5) and (5,6).\n> \n> (6,5) is at x=6,y=5, which might be accessible.\n> \n> (5,6) at x=5,y=6.\n> \n> Now, current head (2,3).\n> \n> If I go up to (2,4), then from there, I can go U, D, L, R? Direction now U, so I can go U, L, R, not D (reverse).\n> \n> Similarly, if down to (2,2), direction D, can go D, L, R, not U.\n> \n> I should consider both options.\n> \n> First, let's think about the food at (1,3). It has life span 2, so only available this turn and next. If I don't eat it now, I might eat it next turn, but from where?\n> \n> If I don't go left now, I can go up or down, then next turn I might be able to approach (1,3) from another direction, but (1,3) is surrounded: left wall, up obstacle, down obstacle, so only accessible from right, which is (2,3).\n> \n> (1,3) can only be accessed from (2,3), since other sides blocked.\n> \n> So to eat (1,3), I must be at (2,3) and move left to (1,3). But as we saw, that traps me.\n> \n> If I don't eat it this turn, on turn 16, if I am at a position to move to (1,3), but from where? Only from (2,3). So if I leave (2,3) now, I can't come back to (2,3) easily because the snake body might be there.\n> \n> For example, if I go up to (2,4) on turn 15, then on turn 16, head at (2,4), and (2,3) is body, so I can't move to (2,3) because it's occupied. Similarly, if I go down to (2,2), same thing.\n> \n> Moreover, (1,3) life span 2: after turn 15, if not eaten, at start of turn 16, life span decreases to 1, so it can be eaten on turn 16 if I can reach it.\n> \n> But to reach (1,3) on turn 16, I need to be at (2,3) on turn 16, but on turn 16, (2,3) might be occupied by body.\n> \n> After turn 15 action:\n> \n> Case 1: If I go up to (2,4) on turn 15, positions: head (2,4), body (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3)\n> \n> Then on turn 16, I can move from (2,4) to possible cells: U to (2,5), D to (2,3) but (2,3) is body, collision, L to (1,4) obstacle, R to (3,4) which is obstacle? Internal obstacles: (3,4) is listed, yes.\n> \n> (3,4) is internal obstacle.\n> \n> So from (2,4), possible moves:\n> \n> - U: (2,5) - is it free? No obstacles listed at (2,5), no walls, not body (body is (2,3),(3,3),etc.), so free.\n> \n> - D: (2,3) - but occupied by body, collision, so not possible.\n> \n> - L: (1,4) - obstacle, not possible.\n> \n> - R: (3,4) - obstacle, not possible.\n> \n> So only possible move is U to (2,5).\n> \n> Similarly, if on turn 15 I go down to (2,2), then head at (2,2), body (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3)\n> \n> On turn 16, from (2,2), direction D (since moved down), so can go D, L, R, not U.\n> \n> - D to (2,1) - free? Not wall, not obstacle (obstacles at (1,2), but (2,1) not listed), not body, so free.\n> \n> - L to (1,2) - obstacle, not possible.\n> \n> - R to (3,2) - free? Not listed obstacle, not body, walls ok.\n> \n> - U to (2,3) - body, collision, not possible.\n> \n> So possible moves: D to (2,1) or R to (3,2).\n> \n> But not to (2,3) or (1,3).\n> \n> In both cases, after moving away from (2,3), I cannot return to (2,3) because it becomes body, so I cannot eat (1,3) on turn 16 or later. Since (1,3) can only be accessed from (2,3), and (2,3) is now body, I can never eat (1,3) after this turn.\n> \n> Therefore, if I don't eat (1,3) on turn 15, it will disappear unused.\n> \n> But eating it traps me, as we saw.\n> \n> So better to avoid (1,3) completely and focus on other food and survival.\n> \n> So for turn 15, I should not go left. Instead, go up or down.\n> \n> Now, which one?

It's turn 16. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and internal obstacles at (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1).

So the snake is 5 segments long, moving up (U), so it was coming from (2,3) to (2,4).\n> \n> Head direction is U, meaning last move was up to (2,4).\n> \n> Food:\n> \n> - (1,3) with life span 1, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (6,5) with life span 4, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (5,6) with life span 7, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (2,1) with life span 10, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> All food is positive; no negative food mentioned.\n> \n> Life span decreases each turn, including current turn. So at turn 16, for (1,3), life span is 1, so it disappears after this turn? Life span: \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So at turn t, if life span is L, it will disappear after turn t + L - 1? Let me clarify.\n> \n> If at turn t, a food has life span N, it means it will disappear after N more turns. So on turn t, it's present; turn t+1, if N>1, it might still be there, but countdown decreases. After N turns from now, it's gone.\n> \n> Specifically: if life span is N at turn t, it will be gone on turn t + N. Because on turn t, it decreases to N-1 for the next turn, and so on, until N=0, then it disappears.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So at the start of turn t, if life span is N, after this turn, it decreases to N-1. So if N=1, after turn t, it disappears; it's not available on turn t+1.\n> \n> Similarly, if N=1 at turn t, it can be eaten on turn t, but not after.\n> \n> In this case, for (1,3), life span 1 at turn 16.

Positions: after move, snake is at [(2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3)]\n> \n> Previous: indices: 0:head (2,4), 1: (2,3), 2: (3,3), 3: (4,3), 4:tail (5,3)\n> \n> After move U: head to (2,5), so new position 0: (2,5)\n> \n> Then position 1: previous position 0, which is (2,4)\n> \n> Position 2: previous position 1, which is (2,3)\n> \n> Position 3: previous position 2, which is (3,3)\n> \n> Position 4: previous position 3, which is (4,3)\n> \n> The previous position 4 (5,3) is left, so tail moved from (5,3) to (4,3), but since we didn't eat, length same, so tail is at (4,3), and (5,3) is empty now.\n> \n> Okay.\n> \n> Now, at turn 16, I have to choose action for turn 16.\n> \n> But only one possible move?

(1,3) is not adjacent to (2,4); it's diagonal or something? (2,4) to (1,3) is not adjacent; adjacent means sharing edge, so up, down, left, right.\n> \n> (1,3) is left and down from (2,4), so not directly reachable; I would need to go through (1,4) or (2,3), both blocked.\n> \n> (1,4) is wall, (2,3) is body, so impossible to reach (1,3) from current position in one move. In fact, since (1,4) is wall, and (1,3) might be accessible from other sides, but from (2,4), no direct path, and with obstacles, it might be unreachable now.\n> \n> For example, to reach (1,3), I could go left to (1,4) but wall, or down to (2,3) but body, so I can't move to (1,3) this turn. And since life span is 1, it disappears after this turn, so I cannot eat it at all. It's impossible to eat (1,3) on this turn or ever, since it disappears.\n> \n> So forget about (1,3); it will disappear unused.\n> \n> Now, other food: (6,5), (5,6), (2,1).\n> \n> (2,1) is far, life span 10, so plenty of time.\n> \n> But I need to move.\n> \n> From (2,4), only possible move is U to (2,5), as we saw.\n> \n> Is there any other option?

Let's clarify the life span.\n> \n> The input says: \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value: (6,5,3,1)\" so it's (x,y,life_span,value).

It's turn 19, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think? Let me confirm: walls are at x=0 and x=7, so x from 1 to 6; y=0 and y=7, so y from 1 to 6. But there are internal obstacles too.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: [(5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1)]. So these cells are blocked and I can't move there.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (3,6), then (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3). So the snake is 5 segments long. Head direction is Up, which means last move was Up, so from (3,5) to (3,6), I assume.\n> \n> Food:\n> \n> - (6,5) with life span 2, value +1 (positive food)\n> \n> - (5,6) with life span 4, value +1\n> \n> - (2,1) with life span 7, value +1\n> \n> - (4,1) with life span 10, value +1\n> \n> All food seems to be positive, no negative food mentioned. Value is 1 for all, and life span decreasing each turn.\n> \n> Life span: for (6,5), life span 2, meaning it disappears after 2 more turns, including current turn? The rule says: \"disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So for (6,5), at turn 19, life span 2, so it will disappear after turn 20? Let's think carefully.\n> \n> \"Disappears after N turns\" – I think it means that after N turns from now, it's gone. Since countdown decreases every turn including current, at turn t, if life span is L, it will be gone after turn t + L - 1? Let's clarify.\n> \n> Suppose at turn t, food has life span L. After turn t, countdown decreases by 1 to L-1. After turn t+1, if L-1 >0, it decreases to L-2, and so on, until it reaches 0, and then it disappears. So it can be eaten until the turn when countdown is 1, I think. After that turn, it disappears.\n> \n> For example, (6,5) at turn 19, life span 2. After turn 19, countdown becomes 1; after turn 20, countdown becomes 0, and it disappears, so it can be eaten on turn 19 or 20, but not after that.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,6) life span 4: can be eaten on turns 19,20,21,22.\n> \n> (2,1) life span 7: turns 19 to 25.\n> \n> (4,1) life span 10: turns 19 to 28.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (3,6), direction Up. Possible moves: U, D, L, R, but with constraints.\n> \n> No instant reverse: since head direction is Up, I cannot move Down immediately, because that would be opposite direction. So possible moves: Up, Left, Right. Down is not allowed.\n> \n> Also, need to avoid walls and body collisions, but body collision: if head moves to a body segment, it dies, except if it's the tail and the tail moves away, but generally, for now, the tail is at (2,3), and head is at (3,6).\n> \n> Let me sketch the grid mentally.\n> \n> Grid: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, but walls at borders, so cells (1,1) to (6,6) are playable, except internal obstacles.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1).

(3,5) is the second segment, so moving Down to (3,5) would cause collision with body. Also, Down is opposite to current direction Up, so it's invalid anyway.\n> \n> - Left: to (2,6). Is (2,6) free? Snake positions: (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3). So (2,6) not occupied. Walls: y=6 is not wall, walls are y=0 and y=7, so y=6 is inside. x=0 and x=7 walls, so x=2 is fine. Internal obstacles: check if (2,6) is obstacle. Obstacles are (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1). (2,6) not listed, so free.

When head moves to (6,6), the tail moves from (2,3) to (2,4)? Let's see snake movement.\n> \n> When snake moves without eating, tail moves forward, so segments shift.\n> \n> In this case, on turn 20, after eating at (5,6), snake grows, so positions: head (5,6), then (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), and tail (2,3) but since it grew, tail is still (2,3), no.\n> \n> When you eat, the tail doesn't move that turn, so segments: after move to (5,6) and eat, the new head is (5,6), previous head (4,6) becomes body, and the tail stays, so positions: (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), and (2,3) is still there? No.\n> \n> Snake positions before turn 20: at start of turn 20, positions are [(4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4)] because on turn 19, I moved to (4,6), so head at (4,6), body (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), tail (2,3) but (2,3) is part of body, positions are (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), and (2,3) is the last segment? Let's list positions after each turn.\n> \n> At turn 19 start: snake positions [(3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3)]\n> \n> I move Right to (4,6).\n> \n> After move, new positions: head to (4,6), so the body follows: the segment that was at (3,6) moves to where head was? No.\n> \n> Standard snake: when head moves to a new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> So from positions: head (3,6) moves to (4,6), so new head (4,6).\n> \n> The body segment that was at (3,5) moves to (3,6), the segment at (2,5) moves to (3,5), (2,4) moves to (2,5), and (2,3) moves to (2,4). Tail was (2,3), now moves to (2,4), and the cell (2,3) is empty.\n> \n> So after turn 19 move to (4,6): positions [(4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4)]  (2,3) is gone, tail now at (2,4).\n> \n> Length still 5, no food eaten.\n> \n> Now turn 20: from (4,6), I move right to (5,6). (5,6) has food, so I eat it.\n> \n> After move to (5,6) and eat, new head (5,6), the body: segment at (4,6) stays as body, (3,6) stays, (3,5) stays, (2,5) stays, (2,4) stays, and since I ate, a new segment is added at the tail position, so tail was at (2,4), it stays, and new tail is added? No.\n> \n> When you eat, after moving the head to the food cell, the tail does not move, so the snake grows by one segment at the tail.\n> \n> So positions: head (5,6), then the previous body: (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), and since tail didn't move, (2,4) is still there, but now it's not the tail, the new tail is the last segment, which is (2,4) or?\n> \n> Before move: positions [(4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4)] so head (4,6), tail (2,4).\n> \n> Move head to (5,6), which has food, so after move, head is (5,6), the first body segment moves to (4,6) which was head position, but (4,6) is now occupied by the body, so positions: new head (5,6), then (4,6) (which was head), then (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), and tail (2,4) stays because no move for tail when eating. So the snake has a new segment, so positions: (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4) — length 6, tail at (2,4).\n> \n> (2,4) is now the tail, and (2,5) is the second last.\n> \n> Now, head at (5,6), direction from (4,6) to (5,6) is Right, so head direction Right.\n> \n> Turn 21: possible moves.\n> \n> Cannot move Left (opposite to Right).\n> \n> Up: (5,7) invalid wall.\n> \n> Down: (5,5) but (5,5) is obstacle, blocked.\n> \n> Right: (6,6) — is it free? Walls: x=6,y=6, x=6 is not wall, walls x=0,x=7, so x=6 ok, y=6 ok, no internal obstacle at (6,6), so yes, can move to (6,6).\n> \n> So must move to (6,6).\n> \n> After move, no food, so positions shift: head to (6,6), body: (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), tail moves to (2,4)?

So when head moves to (3,6), that cell is now the head, and the segment that was there becomes part of the body.\n> \n> Then, the next segment moves to where the first body was, which is (3,6), but it's now occupied, so collision? I think there is a collision because the head is moving to a cell that is immediately occupied by a body segment, and since it's not the tail, it doesn't move away in time.\n> \n> The note says: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> But here, (3,6) is not the tail; it's the first body segment. The tail is (2,4).\n> \n> So moving to (3,6) would cause head to collide with body segment at (3,6), which is deadly.\n> \n> Similarly, for any body segment except the tail, moving into it causes collision.\n> \n> In this case, (3,6) is adjacent to head and is a body segment, so moving left to (3,6) is invalid and deadly.\n> \n> Therefore, I cannot move left.\n> \n> Now, up: (4,7) is y=7, wall, so invalid.\n> \n> Down: (4,5) - let's check if free.\n> \n> (4,5): coordinates, x=4,y=5.\n> \n> Not in snake: snake positions are (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4). (3,5) is there, but (4,5) is not listed, so not occupied.\n> \n> Not an obstacle: obstacles are (1,4), (1,5), (1,2), (3,4), (4,4), (5,2), (5,5), (6,1). (4,5) not among them.\n> \n> So (4,5) is free.\n> \n> Right: (5,6) - x=5,y=6.\n> \n> Is this free? Snake: (4,6), (3,6), etc. no (5,6).\n> \n> Obstacles: (5,5) is obstacle, (5,2), but (5,6) not listed, so should be free.\n> \n> Also, there is food at (5,6) with value +1, life span 3.\n> \n> So moving right to (5,6) would eat the food, since head moves onto it.\n> \n> Now, possible actions for turn 20: U, D, R, but U is wall, so invalid. L is body, invalid. So only D or R.\n> \n> D: down to (4,5)\n> \n> R: right to (5,6)\n> \n> I need to think ahead multiple turns.\n> \n> First, if I move R to (5,6), I eat the food there. Food at (5,6) has life span 3, so it will disappear after 3 turns, but since I eat it now, it's gone.\n> \n> Eating food: head moves to (5,6), which has food, so I eat it, length increases by 1. New positions: head (5,6), then body (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4). And since I ate, a new segment is added, so snake becomes length 6: positions [(5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4)]\n> \n> After eating, the new segment is added at the tail? No, in snake, when you eat, the head grows, so the tail stays, but a new segment is added where the tail was or something? Standard: when you eat, the head moves to the food cell, and a new segment is added to the tail, so the tail doesn't move, and the snake grows.\n> \n> Rule: \"Length of snake +1\" for positive food.\n> \n> So when eating, head moves to food cell, and the tail does not move, so a new segment is added at the tail position, making the snake longer.\n> \n> In terms of positions: suppose before move, positions S = [H, B1, B2, ..., T]\n> \n> After moving without eating: new head at new position, then body: B1, B2, ..., T, but T moves away if not eaten.\n> \n> With eating: head moves to food, new positions: [new_head, H, B1, B2, ..., T] and since eating, the tail stays, so T position has the new segment added, so positions become [new_head, H, B1, B2, ..., T] with T not moving.\n> \n> In this case, if I move to (5,6), which has food, so head moves to (5,6), and since I eat, the tail (2,4) does not move, so new positions: head (5,6), then previous head (4,6) now body, then (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4) and since growth, the tail stays, so positions: [(5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4)] with (2,4) being the end.\n> \n> Tail is now (2,4), but it was the tail before, now it's still there with a new segment? No: the segment at (2,4) remains, and since the snake grows, it doesn't move, so the new tail is at (2,4), and the segment before that is (2,5), etc.\n> \n> Original positions: [ (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4) ] head at (4,6), tail at (2,4)\n> \n> After moving right to (5,6) and eating: head to (5,6), so new head (5,6), then the previous positions become the body, but since eating, the tail stays, so body: (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4) but (2,4) doesn't move, so it's part of the body. So new positions: [ (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4) ] with head (5,6), tail (2,4). Length 6.\n> \n> If I don't eat, and move to a free cell, then head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the previous position, so tail moves away.\n> \n> For example, if I move down to (4,5), no food there, so head moves to (4,5), body: (4,6) moves to where head was? Positions: new head (4,5), then body segments: the first body segment moves to previous head position (4,6), so (4,6) is now occupied by body, then (3,6) moves to (3,6)? Let's sequence:\n> \n> Current: pos0: (4,6) head, pos1: (3,6), pos2: (3,5), pos3: (2,5), pos4: (2,4) tail.\n> \n> After moving down to (4,5):\n> \n> - New head: (4,5)\n> \n> - Then pos1 (which was at (3,6)) moves to pos0 old position, which is (4,6)\n> \n> - Pos2 ( (3,5) ) moves to pos1 old position (3,6)\n> \n> - Pos3 ( (2,5) ) moves to pos2 old position (3,5)\n> \n> - Pos4 ( (2,4) ) moves to pos3 old position (2,5)\n> \n> - And tail was at (2,4), which moves to (2,5), so (2,4) is free now.\n> \n> So new positions: [ (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5) ] head at (4,5), tail at (2,5).\n> \n> Back to choices.\n> \n> For turn 20, I can move down to (4,5) or right to (5,6).\n> \n> Now, food: (6,5) life span 1, so it disappears after this turn or next? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 20, it has life span 1, meaning after this turn, it might disappear if not eaten.\n> \n> Life span: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So for food at (6,5) with life span 1 at turn 20: during turn 20, if not eaten, at the end of turn 20, life span decreases to 0, and it disappears, so it's only available this turn.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,6) life span 3, so it has 3 turns left including this one, so if not eaten now, it will be there for turns 20,21,22, disappear after turn 22.\n> \n> (2,1) life span 6, (4,1) life span 9.\n> \n> (6,5) is about to disappear; if I don't eat it now, it's gone.\n> \n> But to eat (6,5), I need to go to (6,5), which is from (4,6), I can't reach directly; I need to move towards it.\n> \n> From (4,6), to go to (6,5), I could move right to (5,6) first, but (5,6) has food, so if I move there, I eat that instead.\n> \n> If I want (6,5), I need to go directly, but from (4,6), I can go down to (4,5) or right to (5,6), not to (6,5) directly.\n> \n> After moving, I can go further.\n> \n> But (6,5) life span 1, so only this turn to eat it.\n> \n> If I don't eat it this turn, it disappears.\n> \n> So, to eat (6,5) on turn 20, I need to be at (6,5) now, but I'm at (4,6), so I can't; it's too far. I can only move to adjacent cells. So I cannot eat (6,5) on this turn; it will disappear after this turn since life span becomes 0.\n> \n> Therefore, (6,5) is not eatable; it will be gone after turn 20.\n> \n> So forget about that food.\n> \n> Now, food at (5,6) can be eaten if I move right.\n> \n> Food at (2,1) and (4,1) are farther, with longer life.\n> \n> Now, I need to think ahead 5+ turns.\n> \n> First, let's consider moving right to (5,6) and eating it.\n> \n> Then positions: head (5,6), body (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4) length 6.\n> \n> Direction: since I moved right, new head direction is R.\n> \n> Now, from (5,6), possible moves: U, D, L, R, but no instant reverse, so cannot move L (left).\n> \n> U: (5,7) y=7 wall, invalid.\n> \n> D: (5,5) - is this free? (5,5) is an internal obstacle, listed in obstacles: (5,5) is there, so wall, cannot go.\n> \n> L: (4,6) - but (4,6) is now the first body segment. Since I just moved, (4,6) is occupied by body. Can I move to (4,6)? It's not the tail; tail is at (2,4). So moving left to (4,6) would cause collision with body segment.\n> \n> R: (6,6) - x=6,y=6. Is this within bounds? x=6, y=6, borders are x=0,x=7 walls, so x=6 is not wall, since walls are x=0 and x=7, so x=6 is playable. Similarly y=6.\n> \n> Is (6,6) free? Not in snake positions, not in obstacles. Obstacles: (6,1) is wall, but (6,6) not listed, so free.\n> \n> So from (5,6), possible moves: only R to (6,6), since U wall, D wall ( (5,5) obstacle), L body, so only right to (6,6).\n> \n> After moving to (6,6), no food there, so no eat.\n> \n> New positions: head to (6,6), body: (5,6) moves to where head was? After eating, positions: [ (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4) ]\n> \n> Move to (6,6): no food, so head to (6,6), then body segments move: (5,6) moves to previous position? Standard: the first body segment moves to the old head position (5,6), but it's already there? Let's think.\n> \n> After eating at turn 20, positions: [(5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4)]\n> \n> Now turn 21, move to (6,6).\n> \n> Since no food, head moves to (6,6), then the body: the segment that was at (5,6) moves to where? The new head is at (6,6), so the first body segment moves to the previous head position, which is (5,6). But (5,6) is currently occupied by the head, but head is moving, so the cell (5,6) becomes free for the body to move to? In terms of positions, the segment that was at position 1 ( (4,6) ) moves to position 0 old, which is (5,6).\n> \n> List indices.\n> \n> After turn 20: positions: idx 0: (5,6) head, idx1: (4,6), idx2: (3,6), idx3: (3,5), idx4: (2,5), idx5: (2,4) tail.\n> \n> Move to (6,6) no food.\n> \n> New head: (6,6)\n> \n> Then idx1 moves to old idx0 position: (5,6)\n> \n> Idx2 moves to old idx1 position: (4,6)\n> \n> Idx3 moves to old idx2 position: (3,6)\n> \n> Idx4 moves to old idx3 position: (3,5)\n> \n> Idx5 (tail) moves to old idx4 position: (2,5)\n> \n> So new positions: [(6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5)] head (6,6), tail (2,5)\n> \n> Now, from (6,6), direction R.\n> \n> Possible moves: U (6,7) y=7 wall, invalid.\n> \n> D (6,5) - but (6,5) had food, but it disappeared after turn 20, since life span was 1 at turn 20, not eaten, so gone. Now (6,5) should be free? But is it accessible?\n> \n> (6,5): x=6,y=5. Not wall, not obstacle? Obstacles: (6,1) is wall, but (6,5) not listed, so free.\n> \n> But snake is not there.\n> \n> L (5,6) - (5,6) is now the first body segment, idx1. Moving left to (5,6) would be collision, since it's body.\n> \n> R (7,6) x=7 wall, invalid.\n> \n> So only possible move: down to (6,5).\n> \n> Move to (6,5), no food, so head to (6,5), body: idx1 (5,6) to (6,6), idx2 (4,6) to (5,6), idx3 (3,6) to (4,6), idx4 (3,5) to (3,6), idx5 (2,5) to (3,5)?

The segment that was following (3,6), which is idx2 (3,5), moves to the position of idx1, which was (3,6)\n> \n> Standard: the segment that was at position i moves to the position of segment i-1 from the previous state, but since head moved, it's the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> After head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the position of the segment it was following.\n> \n> So: segment at idx1 ( (3,6) ) moves to where idx0 was, (4,6)\n> \n> Segment at idx2 ( (3,5) ) moves to where idx1 was, (3,6)\n> \n> Segment at idx3 ( (2,5) ) moves to where idx2 was, (3,5)\n> \n> Segment at idx4 ( (2,4) ) moves to where idx3 was, (2,5)\n> \n> So new positions: [(4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5)] head (4,5), tail (2,5)\n> \n> Direction: moved down, so new direction D.\n> \n> From (4,5), possible moves: U, D, L, R, but no instant reverse, so cannot move U (up, opposite to down).\n> \n> U: (4,6) - but (4,6) is now the first body segment.

So, I should sketch a grid to visualize this.\n> \n> The grid is 8x8 since x from 0 to 7 and y from 0 to 7. Walls are at the borders and those internal points.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (6,4), then body segments at (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6). So the snake is moving downwards, since head is at (6,4) and next is (6,5), which is above it? Let's see: positions are listed as [(6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6)]. Head is (6,4), and (6,5) is directly above it in y-direction? y=4 to y=5, but if y increases upwards or downwards?\n> \n> In the movement, U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), so I need to know the coordinate system. Typically in such games, (0,0) is bottom-left or top-left? But here it doesn't specify, but from the movement: U (x,y+1) increases y, which might be up if y=0 is bottom, or down if y=0 is top. But in the state, snake head is at (6,4), and direction is D, which is down, meaning y decreases? Let's clarify.\n> \n> Snake head direction is given as D, which is down, (x,y-1). Now, current positions: head (6,4), then (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), etc. (6,4) to (6,5): if y increases, (6,5) has higher y, so if U is (x,y+1), that would be moving up to higher y. But the snake is moving down? Head direction is D, so it should be moving to lower y.\n> \n> Inconsistency here. Positions: [(6,4), (6,5), (6,6), ...]. From head to body: head (6,4), then (6,5), which is y=5 > y=4, so if y increases upwards, (6,5) is above (6,4). But direction is D, down, which should be decreasing y. But if head is at (6,4) and moving down, it should go to (6,3), but the next segment is at (6,5), which is behind it? I think I have the direction wrong.\n> \n> Perhaps the positions are listed from head to tail. Head is first, so (6,4) is head, then (6,5) is the next segment, meaning the head was previously at (6,5) or something? Let's think about the movement.\n> \n> When the snake moves, the head moves to a new position, and each segment follows the previous one. So if the head was at position A, and moves to B, then the segment that was at A moves to where the head was, but since it's a chain, each segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> At turn t, positions: head at H_t, then segment at S1_t, S2_t, etc.\n> \n> After move, at t+1, head moves to new position, say H_{t+1}, then S1_{t+1} = H_t, S2_{t+1} = S1_t, and so on.\n> \n> In this case, for turn 24, positions: [(6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6)]\n> \n> Since head is at (6,4), and it was moving down (direction D), so previous position before moving to (6,4) was probably (6,3) or something, but let's see the sequence.\n> \n> The body segments show where the snake was. Since head is at (6,4), and next segment is at (6,5), that means before moving to (6,4), the head was at (6,5) at some point? Let's list the positions in order:\n> \n> Index 0: (6,4) head\n> \n> Index 1: (6,5)\n> \n> Index 2: (6,6)\n> \n> Index 3: (5,6)\n> \n> Index 4: (4,6)\n> \n> Index 5: (3,6) tail\n> \n> Since the snake was moving down to reach (6,4), that means it came from a position with higher y, like (6,5), which has y=5, and moved down to (6,4) with y=4. So y decreases when moving down.\n> \n> Therefore, in this coordinate system, higher y is up, lower y is down. So (0,0) is bottom-left, I assume, with x increasing right, y increasing up. Confirmed by U: (x,y+1) up, D: (x,y-1) down, L: (x-1,y) left, R: (x+1,y) right.\n> \n> So head at (6,4), moving down (D), so it just moved from (6,5) to (6,4) between turns 23 and 24? At turn 24, it is at (6,4), and direction is D, meaning it moved down to get there.\n> \n> Now, food positions:\n> \n> - (2,1) with life span 3, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (4,1) with life span 5, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (4,2) with life span 8, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> All food is positive, no negative food mentioned.

It's turn 25, and the grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, meaning coordinates from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are the borders, so playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6)? No, let's clarify.\n> \n> The walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the grid is 8x8, with cells from (0,0) to (7,7), but the borders are walls, so snake can only be in (1,1) to (6,6). Also, there are internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1). So these are blocked cells.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (6,3), then (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6). So the head is at (6,3), moving down, since direction is D. Down means decreasing y? Let's confirm the coordinate system.\n> \n> Typically in such grids, (0,0) is bottom-left or top-left? The movement: U is (x,y+1), so if U increases y, that might imply y increases upwards. But D is (x,y-1), so y decreases when moving down, so probably y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top? But walls at y=0 and y=7, so y=0 is bottom wall, y=7 is top wall.\n> \n> In the snake positions: head at (6,3), then (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6). Since head direction is D (down), and from (6,3) to (6,4) would be up if y increases upwards? Let's see the sequence.\n> \n> Snake positions: [(6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6)]\n> \n> Head is (6,3), next segment (6,4), so from (6,3) to (6,4) is an increase in y, which should be up if U is (x,y+1). But head direction is given as D, down. Contradiction?\n> \n> Head direction is the direction the head is facing, which is the direction it moved to get to current position? Or the direction for next move?\n> \n> The state says: \"Snake Head Direction: D\" and current head is at (6,3). But the previous position must be where it came from.\n> \n> List positions in order: index 0: head (6,3), index 1: (6,4), index 2: (6,5), index 3: (6,6), index 4: (5,6), index 5: (4,6).\n> \n> So from head to tail: at turn 25, head is at (6,3), and it moved to this position from... since direction is D, down, meaning it came from above? Let's think.\n> \n> If head direction is D, and it's at (6,3), that means it moved down to (6,3), so it came from (6,4)? But (6,4) is the next segment. Positions are given with head first, so segment 0 is head, segment 1 is the neck, and so on to tail.\n> \n> So at some previous turn, the head was at (6,4), and it moved down to (6,3)? But (6,4) is now occupied by segment 1, which is correct.\n> \n> From the positions, moving from (6,4) to (6,3) would be down, since y decreased from 4 to 3? y=4 to y=3, so y decreased, which is down direction.\n> \n> But in the list, position 0 is (6,3), position 1 is (6,4), so the head was at (6,4) at previous turn, moved down to (6,3), so now head at (6,3), and body at (6,4), (6,5), etc.\n> \n> Direction D means it moved down to current position, so for next move, it can go U, L, R, but not D, because no instant reverse?

But check internal obstacles: internal obstacles are (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1). (6,2) is not listed, so should be free, but is it occupied by snake? Snake positions: head (6,3), body (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6). So (6,2) is not occupied, so moving D to (6,2) is possible? But let's confirm the grid.\n> \n> Grid: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So cells (1,1) to (6,6) are playable, except where obstacles or snake.\n> \n> (6,2): x=6, y=2, not wall, and not in obstacle list: obstacles are (5,2), (4,4), etc., (6,2) not listed, so free, not occupied by snake, so can move there.\n> \n> Moving L: left to (5,3). x=5,y=3. Is it wall? x=5 not 0 or 7, y=3 not 0 or 7. Obstacles: (5,2) is obstacle, but (5,3) not listed. Snake: (5,6) is occupied, but (5,3) not in positions, so free. So can move to (5,3).\n> \n> Moving R: right to (7,3). But x=7 is wall, since border cells x=7 are walls. So cannot move R to (7,3).\n> \n> Also, cannot move U to (6,4) because it's occupied by body.\n> \n> So possible moves from (6,3) with current direction D: cannot move U (reverse and occupied), can move D to (6,2), L to (5,3), R to (7,3) but wall, so not possible. So only D and L are possible? D to (6,2) and L to (5,3).\n> \n> But L to (5,3) is left, which is not opposite to D, so ok.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead, maximize score, avoid risks.\n> \n> First, let's list the food:\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (2,1) with value 1, life_span 2 (so disappears after 2 turns, including current?

Playable area: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, except obstacles.\n> \n> Obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1)\n> \n> So blocked cells: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1)\n> \n> Snake: head (6,3), body (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6)\n> \n> Tail at (4,6)\n> \n> Food at: (2,1), (4,1), (4,2), (2,5)\n> \n> (4,2) is food, but (4,2) is not obstacle? Obstacles include (4,4), etc., but (4,2) is food, so it's not blocked, food can be on free cells.\n> \n> Now, I need to eat food while avoiding collisions.\n> \n> But there's a special case: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because after eating, tail grows and collides with head.\n> \n> Currently, tail is at (4,6), head at (6,3), not adjacent. Adjacent cells to head (6,3) are: (6,4) up, (6,2) down, (5,3) left, (7,3) right but wall. (6,4) is body, not tail. Tail is (4,6), far away.\n> \n> So no immediate danger.\n> \n> Now, possible moves:\n> \n> Option 1: Move D to (6,2)\n> \n> Then head at (6,2). Now, from (6,2), possible moves: U to (6,3) but (6,3) is now body? After moving to (6,2), the snake positions: head at (6,2), then the body: since not eating, tail moves, so segments: new head (6,2), then previous head (6,3) becomes neck, then (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), and tail (4,6) is gone? When snake moves without eating, the tail moves away.\n> \n> At turn 25, positions: [ (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6) ]\n> \n> After move D to (6,2):\n> \n> Head moves to (6,2), then each body segment moves to previous position, so:\n> \n> New positions: head (6,2), then (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6). Tail was (4,6), but since no growth, it disappears, so the new tail is (5,6), which was previously the second last.\n> \n> Positions: index 0: (6,3) head, 1: (6,4), 2: (6,5), 3: (6,6), 4: (5,6), 5: (4,6) tail.\n> \n> After move down to (6,2): new head (6,2), then body: position 0 moves to (6,2), position 1 moves to old position 0, which is (6,3), position 2 moves to old position 1 (6,4), position 3 to old 2 (6,5), position 4 to old 3 (6,6), position 5 to old 4 (5,6). Old position 5 (4,6) is left, so tail gone. New snake: [(6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6)] and tail at (5,6).\n> \n> Length is 6, same.\n> \n> From (6,2), direction is D (since moved down). Possible moves: U, D, L, R, but cannot U because opposite to D? Current direction after move is D, so for next turn, cannot move U.\n> \n> Also, (6,2) to U (6,3): but (6,3) is now body segment, occupied, so collision.\n> \n> D to (6,1): but (6,1) is internal obstacle? Obstacles include (6,1), which is wall? No, (6,1) is listed as internal obstacle, so cannot move there.\n> \n> L to (5,2): (5,2) is internal obstacle, blocked.\n> \n> R to (7,2): x=7 wall, cannot.\n> \n> So from (6,2), no possible moves? All directions blocked or occupied.\n> \n> U: (6,3) occupied by body\n> \n> D: (6,1) obstacle\n> \n> L: (5,2) obstacle\n> \n> R: (7,2) wall\n> \n> So indeed, moving to (6,2) leads to a dead end immediately. At turn 26, after moving to (6,2), the snake is stuck and cannot move anywhere without dying.\n> \n> Therefore, moving D to (6,2) is suicidal and must be avoided.\n> \n> So the only possible move at turn 25 is L to (5,3).\n> \n> Then head moves to (5,3).\n> \n> After moving to (5,3), direction is L (left).\n> \n> New positions: head (5,3), then (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6). Tail (4,6) gone, new tail at (5,6).\n> \n> Now, from (5,3), possible moves:\n> \n> - U to (5,4)\n> \n> - D to (5,2) but (5,2) is obstacle, blocked\n> \n> - L to (4,3)\n> \n> - R to (6,3) but (6,3) is now body segment, occupied, so collision\n> \n> Cannot move R because (6,3) is occupied and not tail.\n> \n> Also, current direction is L, so cannot move R (opposite).\n> \n> Possible moves: U to (5,4) or L to (4,3).\n> \n> (5,4): is it free? Check obstacles: internal obstacles include (4,4), (3,4), etc., but (5,4) not listed, so should be free. Snake positions: after move, positions are (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6). So (5,4) not occupied.\n> \n> (4,3) not obstacle or occupied.\n> \n> So can move U or L.\n> \n> Now, let's think about food.\n> \n> Food at: (2,1), life_span 2, so must eat by turn 26.\n> \n> (4,1) life_span 4, eat by turn 28.\n> \n> (4,2) life_span 7, eat by turn 31.\n> \n> (2,5) life_span 10, eat by turn 34.\n> \n> (2,1) is at (2,1), which is close to left-bottom.\n> \n> Head at (5,3) after moving to (5,3) at turn 25.\n> \n> To eat (2,1), need to go left and down.\n> \n> But (2,1) must be eaten by turn 26, so only one turn left: turn 26.\n> \n> At turn 26, after moving to (5,3) at turn 25, head at (5,3).\n> \n> From (5,3), if I move L to (4,3), then at (4,3), then to (2,1) is not adjacent, (4,3) to (2,1) is not directly reachable in one move, since (3,3) or something.\n> \n> From (4,3), I could move down to (4,2) but (4,2) is food, but let's see.\n> \n> (2,1) is at distance: from (5,3) to (2,1) is |5-2|=3 in x, |3-1|=2 in y, so min moves 5, but I have only this turn and next to eat it? Turn 25 action is to move to (5,3), then turn 26 I can move, but (2,1) must be eaten by turn 26, meaning on turn 26.\n> \n> After turn 26, if not eaten, it disappears.\n> \n> So at turn 26, head must be at (2,1) to eat it.\n> \n> But from (5,3) at turn 25 end, to (2,1) at turn 26, that's one move, but |5-2|=3, |3-1|=2, not adjacent, so impossible to reach in one move. Therefore, (2,1) cannot be eaten; it's too far and will disappear after turn 26.\n> \n> Similarly, at turn 25, head at (6,3), moving to (5,3), still not close to (2,1).\n> \n> So (2,1) is unattainable; we should ignore it.\n> \n> Now, other food: (4,1) at (4,1), life_span 4, so eat by turn 28.\n> \n> (4,2) at (4,2), life_span 7.\n> \n> (2,5) at (2,5), life_span 10.\n> \n> Now, head after turn 25 move to (5,3).\n> \n> From (5,3), can move U to (5,4) or L to (4,3).\n> \n> Let's think about the grid and obstacles.\n> \n> First, list all blocked cells:\n> \n> Walls: all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so cells like (0,anything), (7,anything), (anything,0), (anything,7) are walls.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1)\n> \n> (6,1) is internal, but y=1, not border?

It's turn 26, and I'm playing Snake on a 7x7 grid since the borders are x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7. That means the grid goes from (0,0) to (7,7), but since walls are at the borders, I can't go to x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7. Also, there are internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1). So I need to avoid those.\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (5,3), then body segments at (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6). So the snake has 6 segments. Head direction is left, meaning it was moving left to reach (5,3) from the previous position. Since it's moving left, the previous head was at (6,3) or something? Let's list the positions: [(5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6)]. From head to tail: head at (5,3), then (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), tail at (5,6).\n> \n> Head direction is L, so it's facing left. That means from the previous turn, it moved left to (5,3). Before that, the head was probably at (6,3), but (6,3) is now the second segment. Let's think about the movement. On turn 25, head was at (6,3), moved left to (5,3) on turn 26. So current turn 26, head is at (5,3), direction left.\n> \n> Now, food positions with value and life span:\n> \n> - (2,1) value 1, life span 1 (so it disappears after this turn if not eaten? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 26, life span 1 means after this turn, it will be gone? Let me read carefully.\n> \n> Food life span: disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current. So for a food with life span N at turn t, it will disappear at the end of turn t + N - 1? Let's clarify.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> For example, if a food spawns at turn t with life span N, at turn t, life span is N, decreases to N-1 at next turn, and so on, until life span 0, then it disappears. But it says \"disappears after N turns\", so after N turns from spawn, it should be gone.\n> \n> But here, we're given life span at current turn. So for (2,1): life span 1 at turn 26. That means after turn 26, it will disappear? Since countdown decreases including current turn.\n> \n> Let's interpret: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So at the start of turn, when we see the food, life span is the number of turns it will last, including the current turn.\n> \n> For food at (2,1): life span 1 at turn 26. So during turn 26, if not eaten, after turn 26, it disappears. Similarly, (4,1): life span 3, so it will last for 3 more turns including turn 26, so disappears after turn 28? Let's think.\n> \n> Suppose a food has life span N at turn t. After turn t, life span becomes N-1. If life span is 1 at turn t, after turn t, it becomes 0 and disappears. So for (2,1), at turn 26, life span 1, so if not eaten on turn 26, it disappears after this turn.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,1): life span 3, so it will be there for turns 26,27,28, disappears after turn 28.\n> \n> (4,2): life span 6, so turns 26 to 31, disappears after turn 31.\n> \n> (2,5): life span 9, turns 26 to 34, disappears after turn 34.\n> \n> All food has value 1, so all positive food.\n> \n> Now, I need to choose actions for the next few turns, thinking at least 5 turns ahead.

Walls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls.

No, walls are at x=0 and x=7, so cells from x=1 to x=6 are playable, similarly y=1 to y=6, but internal obstacles block some cells.\n> \n> x=0 and x=7 are walls, meaning cells with x=0 or x=7 are occupied, similarly y=0 and y=7.

So cells from (1,1) to (6,6) are playable, but with internal obstacles.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1)\n> \n> List them:\n> \n> - (1,2)\n> \n> - (1,4)\n> \n> - (1,5)\n> \n> - (3,4)\n> \n> - (4,4)\n> \n> - (5,2)\n> \n> - (5,5)\n> \n> - (6,1)\n> \n> And snake positions: (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5)\n> \n> Food at: (4,1), (4,2), (2,5), (5,3)\n> \n> (5,3) is food, but snake body is at (5,3)? Snake positions include (5,3), which is a body segment. Food at (5,3) is under the snake body. According to rules, food under body can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves onto it.\n> \n> Currently, head is at (3,3), body at (4,3), (5,3), etc. So (5,3) is occupied by the snake, so food there can't be eaten now. It has life span 10, so it might be available later if the snake moves away.\n> \n> Similarly, other foods: (4,1) life span 2, (4,2) life span 4, (2,5) life span 7.\n> \n> Life span decreases each turn, including current turn. So at turn 28, life span is given; after this move, it will decrease by 1.\n> \n> Turn 28: food life spans are as given.\n> \n> After turn 28 action, life span decreases by 1 for all food.\n> \n> Then turn 29, and so on.\n> \n> I need to plan a sequence for the next few turns, at least 5 turns ahead.\n> \n> First, let's list possible actions for turn 28.\n> \n> Head at (3,3), direction L, so cannot go R.\n> \n> Possible moves:\n> \n> - L: to (2,3)\n> \n> - U: to (3,4)\n> \n> - D: to (3,2)\n> \n> Now, check if these are safe.\n> \n> (2,3): is it occupied or wall? Walls: x=0 and x=7, y=0 and y=7 are borders. (2,3) is within 1 to 6 in both x and y, so no border wall. Internal obstacles: (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), (3,4), (4,4), (5,2), (5,5), (6,1). (2,3) not in obstacles, and not in snake body? Snake body: (3,3) is head, (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5). So (2,3) is empty. Safe to move to? But after moving, the snake will have new head position, and tail might move, but since we're moving to empty cell, no collision.\n> \n> Collision: if head moves to a cell occupied by body or wall, it dies. But when moving to a cell, the body segments will move, so only if the cell is occupied by a body segment that won't move away, but since tail moves, only if it's a body segment not the tail.\n> \n> General rule: head can move to a cell if it's not a wall and not occupied by a body segment except the tail, because tail will move forward.\n> \n> In this case, for (2,3): empty, so safe.\n> \n> Similarly, U to (3,4): (3,4) is an internal obstacle? Obstacles include (3,4)? Yes, (3,4) is in the list: internal obstacles (3,4). So (3,4) is a wall cell, cannot move there. Deadly collision.\n> \n> So U is not possible.\n> \n> D to (3,2): (3,2) is within grid? x=3, y=2, y from 1 to 6? y=0 and y=7 walls, so y=1 to 6. (3,2) not in obstacles: obstacles are (1,2), but (1,2) is different. (3,2) not listed, so no obstacle. Snake body: positions are (3,3), (4,3), etc, all y=3 or higher except tail. (3,2) not occupied, so safe.\n> \n> So available moves: L or D. U not possible, R not allowed due to reverse.\n> \n> Now, L to (2,3) or D to (3,2).\n> \n> I need to consider food and future moves.\n> \n> Food locations:\n> \n> - (4,1) at turn 28, life span 2. After turn 28, it decreases to 1, then after turn 29, to 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten only on turn 28 or 29? Life span decreases after each turn, including current.\n> \n> Definition: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> And \"disappears after N turns\", so at the start of turn, if life span is L, it can be eaten during that turn, and after the turn, life span decreases by 1.\n> \n> If life span is 1, it can be eaten on that turn, then disappears.\n> \n> For (4,1): life span 2 at turn 28. So it can be eaten on turn 28 or turn 29.

After move, head direction changes to the move direction.\n> \n> Then from there, possible moves.\n> \n> Similarly, if move D to (3,2), head down.\n> \n> Now, I need to think about eating food.\n> \n> (4,1) is at (4,1), which is below current position. (3,3) to (4,1) is down-left, but not adjacent directly.\n> \n> (4,1) is adjacent to (4,2) and (3,1), etc.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,2) is at (4,2), adjacent to (4,1), (4,3), (3,2), (5,2) but (5,2) is obstacle.\n> \n> (5,2) is internal obstacle.\n> \n> Also, (2,5) is at (2,5), which is left and up.\n> \n> Now, life span of (4,1) is short, only 2 turns left, including current. So if not eaten now or next turn, it disappears.\n> \n> Turn 28: can eat it if I move to (4,1), but from (3,3), (4,1) is not adjacent; adjacent cells are (3,4), (3,2), (2,3), (4,3). (4,3) is occupied by body, so I can't move there directly.\n> \n> From (3,3), I can only move to adjacent empty cells: (2,3), (3,2), or (3,4) but (3,4) obstacle, so only (2,3) or (3,2).\n> \n> Neither is (4,1), so I cannot eat (4,1) this turn.\n> \n> Next turn, turn 29, if I am at a position adjacent to (4,1), I can eat it.\n> \n> (4,1) can be reached from (4,2), (3,1), (5,1), or (4,0) but y=0 wall, so not.\n> \n> (3,1) or (4,2) or (5,1).\n> \n> (5,1) might be obstacle? Internal obstacles: (6,1) is obstacle, but (5,1) not listed, so should be free.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,1) not listed, free.\n> \n> But (4,1) is food.\n> \n> To eat (4,1) on turn 29, I need to be at a cell adjacent to it on turn 29.\n> \n> Similarly for other foods.\n> \n> First, let's consider moving to eat (4,1) since it has short life.\n> \n> But I need to get to a position to eat it.\n> \n> Current position (3,3), moves to (2,3) or (3,2).\n> \n> If I move L to (2,3) on turn 28.\n> \n> Then head at (2,3), direction L.\n> \n> Possible moves from (2,3): U to (2,4), D to (2,2), L to (1,3), R to (3,3).

R not allowed.\n> \n> (2,4): is it free? (2,4) not in obstacles? Obstacles: (1,4), but (2,4) not listed, should be free. Snake body: after move, snake positions: head to (2,3), then body: previous head (3,3) becomes segment, so positions: [(2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5)] but tail is (6,5), when head moves to (2,3), tail moves to (6,4)? Let's think.\n> \n> When snake moves, head goes to new position, each segment moves to previous position of the segment ahead, so tail segment is removed unless eating food.\n> \n> Not eating food, so length same.\n> \n> Start: positions [(3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5)] head (3,3)\n> \n> Move to (2,3): new head (2,3), then (3,3) becomes body, so body segments: (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), and tail (6,5) moves to where? The segment that was at (6,4) is now at (6,3)? Let's index.\n> \n> Positions: index 0: head (3,3), 1: (4,3), 2: (5,3), 3: (6,3), 4: (6,4), 5: tail (6,5)\n> \n> After move L to (2,3): new head at (2,3), then segment 0 moves to (2,3), but segments: new position 0: (2,3), then position 1: old position 0, which is (3,3), position 2: old position 1, (4,3), position 3: old position 2, (5,3), position 4: old position 3, (6,3), position 5: old position 4, (6,4), and tail old position 5 (6,5) is removed, so new positions: [(2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4)]  tail at (6,4)\n> \n> (6,5) is gone.\n> \n> Now, from (2,3), possible moves turn 29: U to (2,4), D to (2,2), L to (1,3)\n> \n> R to (3,3) but reverse, not allowed.\n> \n> (2,4): not obstacle, not body? Body has (3,3), (4,3), etc, (2,4) not occupied, so safe.\n> \n> (2,2): similarly, should be safe.\n> \n> (1,3): x=1, y=3, not border wall, obstacles: (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), so (1,3) not listed, should be free. But let's confirm obstacles: (1,2), (1,4), (1,5) are obstacles, so (1,3) is not, so free.\n> \n> But (1,3) is adjacent to obstacles, but not itself obstacle.\n> \n> So from (2,3), can go U, D, L.\n> \n> Now, to reach (4,1), which is at (4,1).\n> \n> From (2,3), it's not adjacent; I need to move towards it.\n> \n> But (4,1) life span 2 at turn 28, so on turn 29, life span 1, can be eaten on turn 29.\n> \n> If I am at (3,1) or (4,2) or (5,1) on turn 29, I can eat it.\n> \n> From current turn 28, if I move to (2,3), on turn 29 I can go to (2,2) or (1,3) or (2,4), none of which is adjacent to (4,1).\n> \n> (2,2) to (4,1) is not adjacent; (3,1) is adjacent to (4,1), but from (2,2) I can go to (2,1) or (3,2) etc, but not directly to (3,1) in one move from (2,3) or (2,2).\n> \n> From (2,3), if I go D to (2,2) on turn 29, then from (2,2), on turn 30 I can go to (2,1), (3,2), (1,2) but (1,2) obstacle, etc.\n> \n> But (4,1) will disappear after turn 29, since life span 1 on turn 29, after turn 29 it decreases to 0 and disappears, so only turn 29 to eat it.\n> \n> On turn 29, if I am not adjacent to (4,1), I cannot eat it.\n> \n> From turn 28 position (3,3), if I move to (2,3), on turn 29 I am at (2,3), not adjacent to (4,1).

Tail is at (6,4), (3,3) is the second segment, so moving to (3,3) would cause collision because body is there and won't move away when head moves? When head moves, the body segments shift, but the cell (3,3) is currently occupied by the first body segment, which will move to the old head position, but when head moves to a cell, if that cell is occupied by a body segment that is not the tail, it might cause collision.\n> \n> Rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment).

When head moves to (3,3), at the same time, that body segment will move to where? Let's think carefully.\n> \n> When the snake moves, all segments move simultaneously: head to new position, each subsequent segment to the previous position of the one ahead.\n> \n> So, positions before move: head at (3,2) after turn 28 move?

No.\n> \n> After the move, the head is at the new position, and the segment that was there moves to its next position.\n> \n> But if the new head position is the same as a body segment position before the move, it means collision.\n> \n> Specifically, for any body segment except the tail, if head moves to its position, since that segment doesn't move away immediately, it causes collision.\n> \n> For the tail, if head moves to tail position, the tail moves away, so it's ok.\n> \n> In this case, (3,3) is occupied by the first body segment, not the tail.

It's turn 29. The grid is 8x8 because walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so coordinates range from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls occupy those borders, so the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6)? Let me check.\n> \n> Border cells: x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7. So any cell with x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7 is a wall. So the playable area is x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6. That's a 6x6 grid internally.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: [(5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1)]\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (2,3), then (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4). So the snake has 6 segments. Head direction is L, meaning left, so it was moving left last turn, I assume. Since head direction is given as L, and positions show head at (2,3), previous was (3,3), so yes, moving left.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (4,1) with value 1, life span 1 (so it disappears after this turn or next? Life span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 29, life span 1 means it will disappear after this turn if not eaten. Let's read carefully.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So for food at (4,1), life span 1 at turn 29. That means after this turn (turn 29), it will disappear. Because countdown decreases on turn 29, and when it reaches 0, it disappears.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,2) life span 3, so it has 3 turns left including turn 29, so it will disappear after turn 31 if not eaten.\n> \n> (2,5) life span 6, so disappears after turn 34.\n> \n> (5,3) life span 9, disappears after turn 37.\n> \n> But (5,3) is currently occupied by the snake's body. Snake positions: (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4). So (5,3) is the fourth segment, which is body, not head. Head is at (2,3).\n> \n> Food can spawn under body, but can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves onto it later.\n> \n> In this case, food at (5,3) is on the body, so to eat it, the snake needs to move such that the body segment leaves (5,3), and later head comes back to (5,3) when it's free.\n> \n> But food has life span 9, so it might be possible, but we need to think ahead.\n> \n> Now, current head position: (2,3), direction L, so it can move left, up, or down? Movement constraints: cannot move opposite to current direction. Current direction is L (left), so cannot move right (opposite). Can move up, down, or left.\n> \n> Possible moves from (2,3):\n> \n> - Left: to (1,3)\n> \n> - Up: to (2,4)\n> \n> - Down: to (2,2)\n> \n> But need to check walls and obstacles.\n> \n> Walls: borders are walls, so x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1)\n> \n> So for (1,3): is it a wall? x=1, y=3. Not a border wall, and not in internal obstacles. Internal obstacles have (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), but not (1,3). So (1,3) should be free, but is it occupied by snake? Snake positions: from (2,3) to (6,3) and (6,4), so (1,3) is not occupied. So moving left to (1,3) is possible.\n> \n> Up to (2,4): not a wall, not obstacle? Internal obstacles: (1,4), (3,4), but not (2,4). Snake: tail is at (6,4), head at (2,3), so (2,4) not occupied. So possible.\n> \n> Down to (2,2): not wall, obstacles: (1,2), but (2,2) not listed. Snake: not occupied. So possible.\n> \n> But (2,2) is above y=0? y=0 is wall, but (2,2) is y=2, x=2, which is within 1-6, so should be free.\n> \n> Grid: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, I think. x=0 and x=7 walls, so min x=1, max x=6; y=0 and y=7 walls, min y=1, max y=6.\n> \n> So (2,2) is valid.\n> \n> Now, food: we have positive food at (4,1), (4,2), (2,5), (5,3). All value 1, so all positive, no negative food here. Value 1 for all, so all good to eat, but need to avoid risks.\n> \n> (4,1) has life span 1, so if not eaten this turn, it disappears.\n> \n> Current turn is 29, so if head moves to (4,1) this turn, it can eat it, but is it possible? Head at (2,3), (4,1) is two moves away, not adjacent. Adjacent means one move.\n> \n> From (2,3), possible moves: (1,3), (2,4), (2,2). None of these are (4,1). (4,1) is at x=4,y=1.\n> \n> So cannot reach (4,1) this turn. Therefore, (4,1) will disappear after this turn since life span 1. So we cannot eat it; it will be gone.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,2) has life span 3, so available for turns 29,30,31? Countdown decreases every turn including current.\n> \n> At turn 29, life span 1 for (4,1) means it has one turn left, so after turn 29, it disappears.\n> \n> For (4,2), life span 3 at turn 29: after turn 29, life span 2; after turn 30, life span 1; after turn 31, disappears. So can be eaten on turns 29,30,31.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,5) life span 6, available turns 29 to 34.\n> \n> (5,3) life span 9, available turns 29 to 37.\n> \n> But (5,3) is currently occupied by snake body.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (2,3), direction L.\n> \n> I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score and survival.\n> \n> First, let's map the grid to visualize.\n> \n> Create a grid from (1,1) to (6,6).\n> \n> Walls: borders x=0,x=7,y=0,y=7 not playable.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1)\n> \n> So mark obstacles:\n> \n> - (1,2) obstacle\n> \n> - (1,4) obstacle\n> \n> - (1,5) obstacle\n> \n> - (3,4) obstacle\n> \n> - (4,4) obstacle\n> \n> - (5,2) obstacle\n> \n> - (5,5) obstacle\n> \n> - (6,1) obstacle\n> \n> Snake: positions: (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4)\n> \n> So head (2,3), then body (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), tail (6,4)\n> \n> Food: (4,1), (4,2), (2,5), (5,3) but (5,3) has food but occupied, so not accessible yet.\n> \n> (5,3) has food, but snake is on it, so can only eat if snake moves away and head comes back later.\n> \n> Current turn 29.\n> \n> Possible actions at turn 29: from (2,3), can go L to (1,3), U to (2,4), D to (2,2)\n> \n> Cannot go R because opposite to L.\n> \n> Now, let's evaluate each option.\n> \n> First, if go L to (1,3):\n> \n> (1,3) is not obstacle, not wall. Snake body is at (3,3), (4,3), etc., not (1,3). So safe to move.\n> \n> Then head to (1,3), snake grows if eat food? But no food at (1,3), so no eat, length same. Then body follows: new head (1,3), then (2,3) becomes body, so positions: [(1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4)] but since no eat, tail moves, so last segment (6,4) is removed? No.\n> \n> When snake moves without eating, head moves to new position, each segment moves to previous position, so tail is removed.\n> \n> Snake positions after move: head to new position, then the previous positions shift, so the last one is removed.\n> \n> So from [(2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4)] move to (1,3), no food, so new positions: [(1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3)] and (6,4) is removed since tail moved. Tail was at (6,4), it moves to where? The segment before tail was (6,3), which moves to where tail was? Let's think.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when moving, head goes to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment. So the tail segment is left, and if no food eaten, that cell is empty.\n> \n> In terms of positions: old positions: index 0: head, 1,2,3,4,5.\n> \n> After move to new head position, new positions: new head, then old head becomes segment 1, old segment 1 becomes segment 2, ..., old segment 4 becomes segment 5, and old segment 5 (tail) is removed.\n> \n> Here, positions: let's number: seg0: (2,3), seg1: (3,3), seg2: (4,3), seg3: (5,3), seg4: (6,3), seg5: (6,4)\n> \n> Move head to (1,3), no eat. Then new seg0: (1,3), new seg1: old seg0 (2,3), new seg2: old seg1 (3,3), new seg3: old seg2 (4,3), new seg4: old seg3 (5,3), new seg5: old seg4 (6,3). Old seg5 (6,4) is removed.\n> \n> So new snake: [(1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3)] and (6,4) free now.\n> \n> But food at (5,3) is still there? Food is at (5,3), which is now occupied by new seg4: (5,3), which is body, not head. So food is still under body.\n> \n> If go U to (2,4): (2,4) is not obstacle, not wall. Snake? (2,4) not occupied, so move to (2,4), no food there, so new positions: head (2,4), then (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3). Tail (6,4) removed.\n> \n> Similarly, if go D to (2,2): (2,2) is free, move to (2,2), new positions: [(2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3)] with (6,4) removed.\n> \n> Now, food (4,1) will disappear after this turn, so we can't eat it.

Adjacent means sharing a side, so (2,3) and (6,4) are not adjacent; distance is large.\n> \n> So not an issue now.\n> \n> Now, let's think about eating (4,2) which is at (4,2), life span 3, so must eat by turn 31.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,5) at (2,5), life span 6, eat by 34.\n> \n> (5,3) at (5,3), but occupied, life span 9, so we have time.\n> \n> First, from current position (2,3), we can go to (1,3), (2,4), or (2,2).\n> \n> I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> Let's consider the grid and possible paths.\n> \n> First, the food at (4,2) is important because it has short life.

Let's sequence.\n> \n> Turn 29: move to (2,2), no eat, positions: [(2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3)]  // tail (6,3) is last, since (6,4) removed earlier.\n> \n> After turn 29 move to (2,2): head (2,2), then (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3).

New head (4,2), and since eat, tail not removed, so new positions: head (4,2), then previous positions: so old head (3,2) becomes body, (2,2) body, (2,3) body, (3,3) body, (4,3) body, (5,3) body, and we add a new segment where? When eating, the tail doesn't move, so we add a new segment at the position where the tail was before moving? Standard snake: when head moves to food, it eats, so the new head is at food cell, and the tail remains, so snake grows by one segment.\n> \n> Positions: before move, snake at [(3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3)]\n> \n> Move head to (4,2), which has food, so after move: head at (4,2), then the previous segments: seg1: (3,2), seg2: (2,2), seg3: (2,3), seg4: (3,3), seg5: (4,3), and since eat, we add a new segment at the old tail position?

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State\n\nFirst, let's summarize the current state of the game at Turn \\( t_0 = 30 \\):\n\n- **Grid Dimensions**: 8x8 grid with borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.\n- **Internal Obstacles**: \n  - (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1)\n- **Snake Positions**: \n  - Head: (2,4)\n  - Body: [(2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3)] (total length 6)\n- **Snake Head Direction**: U (Up)\n- **Food Items**:\n  - (4,2): value=1, life_span=3\n  - (2,5): value=1, life_span=5\n  - (5,3): value=1, life_span=8 (currently under the snake's body at (5,3))\n\n### Possible Moves at Turn 30\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However, there are restrictions:\n\n1. **No Instant Reverse**: Cannot move in the opposite direction of the current head direction. Current direction is U, so cannot move D.\n2. **Wall and Obstacle Collision**: Cannot move into a cell that is a wall or an internal obstacle.\n3. **Body Collision**: Cannot move into a cell occupied by the snake's body unless it's the tail (since the tail will move forward).\n\nGiven the current head position (2,4) and direction U, let's evaluate possible moves:\n\n1. **Up (U) to (2,5)**:\n   - Check borders: (2,5) is within bounds (x=2, y=5).\n   - Check obstacles: (2,5) is not in the internal obstacles list.\n   - Check body: (2,5) is not currently occupied by the snake's body.\n   - Food: (2,5) has positive food with value=1.\n   - **Valid Move**.\n\n2. **Down (D) to (2,3)**:\n   - Reverse direction from U to D is not allowed.\n   - Also, (2,3) is occupied by the snake's body (second segment), not the tail, so would cause a collision.\n   - **Invalid Move**.\n\n3. **Left (L) to (1,4)**:\n   - Check borders: (1,4) is within bounds.\n   - Check obstacles: (1,4) is in the internal obstacles list.\n   - **Invalid Move**.\n\n4. **Right (R) to (3,4)**:\n   - Check borders: (3,4) is within bounds.\n   - Check obstacles: (3,4) is in the internal obstacles list.\n   - **Invalid Move**.\n\n**Conclusion**: The only valid move at Turn 30 is **Up (U) to (2,5)**.\n\n### Consequences of Moving Up to (2,5)\n\nMoving U to (2,5):\n\n- **New Head Position**: (2,5)\n- **Food at (2,5)**: \n  - It's positive food (+1 score, snake length increases by 1).\n  - The food will be eaten, so it's removed from the food list.\n- **Snake Growth**:\n  - After eating, the snake grows by one segment.\n  - New segment is added at the previous tail position (6,3).\n- **New Snake Positions**:\n  - Head: (2,5)\n  - Body: [(2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,3)] \n    - Wait, this seems incorrect because the tail was at (6,3), and we're adding a new segment there, but the tail doesn't move when eating. Let me correct:\n    - Before move: [(2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3)]\n    - After move and eat:\n      - New head: (2,5)\n      - New body: [(2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3)] (same as before, but shifted)\n      - New segment added at old tail position: (6,3)\n      - So new positions: [(2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3)]\n    - Actually, the tail doesn't move when eating, so the new segment is added where the tail was, and the tail stays there.\n    - So the new tail is at (6,3), and the new segment is also at (6,3), which doesn't make sense because the snake can't have two segments at the same position.\n    - I think the correct interpretation is that the new segment is added where the tail was, and the tail moves forward as usual, but since we're eating, the tail doesn't move, and the new segment is added at the tail's position, making the tail stay there.\n    - Maybe it's better to think that after eating, the tail doesn't move, and a new segment is added where the tail was, making the tail the new segment.\n    - So the snake grows by adding a new segment at the tail's position, and the tail is now the new segment.\n    - Therefore, the new positions are:\n      - Head: (2,5)\n      - Body: [(2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3)]\n      - New segment added at (6,3), so the tail is now at (6,3) (same as before), but the snake is longer.\n    - Wait, that doesn't show growth. Maybe the new segment is added after the tail.\n    - Perhaps the correct sequence is:\n      - Original: [H:(2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), T:(6,3)]\n      - After move U and eat:\n        - New head: (2,5)\n        - Body: [(2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3)]\n        - New segment added at old tail position: (6,3), so now tail is at (6,3), but with an extra segment.\n        - So new positions: [(2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3)]\n    - This seems correct: the snake grows by adding a new segment at the tail's position, making the tail stay where it was, but now the snake is longer.\n\n- **Food Updates**:\n  - (2,5) is eaten, so removed.\n  - (4,2): life_span decreases from 3 to 2 (available until turn 32).\n  - (5,3): life_span decreases from 8 to 7 (available until turn 37).\n\n### Verifying the Only Possible Move\n\nFrom the initial analysis, the only valid move is U to (2,5). Let's double-check:\n\n- **Left (L) to (1,4)**: Blocked by obstacle.\n- **Right (R) to (3,4)**: Blocked by obstacle.\n- **Down (D) to (2,3)**: \n  - Reverse direction (from U to D) is not allowed.\n  - Also, (2,3) is occupied by the body (not the tail), so collision.\n- **Up (U) to (2,5)**: \n  - Not a reverse.\n  - No obstacle.\n  - Not occupied by body (only (2,3), (3,3), etc. are body; (2,5) is free).\n  - Has food, which is positive.\n\nThus, **U is indeed the only valid move**.\n\n### Potential Concerns\n\nOne might worry about the food at (5,3) under the body. However, at this turn, we cannot reach it directly because:\n\n- (5,3) is under the body (specifically, the 5th segment at index 4 in zero-based indexing).\n- To eat it, the body must move away first, which would take multiple turns.\n- Given that its life_span is 8, we have until turn 37 to eat it, which is plenty of time to maneuver.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nGiven the above analysis, the only safe and valid move at Turn 30 is to move Up to (2,5), eating the positive food there.\n\n\\boxed{U}",

No.\n> \n> When you eat, the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move; a new segment is added at the tail position.\n> \n> Standard snake mechanics: when you eat, the head moves to the food cell, and a new segment is added at the previous tail position, so the snake grows by one.\n> \n> But in this case, if the food is under the tail, and you move the head to the tail position to eat it, then after eating, head is on that cell, and a new segment is added at the old tail position, which is the same cell, so collision.\n> \n> But the rule says: \"if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills\"\n> \n> \"Adjacent to the tail\" means head is next to the tail cell, not on it.\n> \n> For example, if tail is at T, head at H, adjacent to T, and T has food. If head moves to T to eat, then after moving, head is on T, which had food, so it eats, and since it ate, the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move, and a new segment is added at the previous tail position, which is T, but head is now on T, so head and new segment are on the same cell, collision, death.\n> \n> Yes, that makes sense.\n> \n> But in our case, for (5,3), it's currently under a body segment, not the tail.\n> \n> The tail is at (6,3).\n> \n> So to eat (5,3) food, we need to have the snake move so that (5,3) is vacated, and then head moves there.\n> \n> Since the food is under body, it will be freed when the body moves away.\n> \n> For example, if the snake moves, the segments shift, so after some moves, (5,3) might be vacated.\n> \n> Currently, at turn 30, (5,3) is S4.\n> \n> After one move without eating, new snake: head moved, S1 to S4 shift, new S5 is old S4 at (5,3), so (5,3) is now tail.\n> \n> Then if the snake moves again, without eating, the tail moves away, so (5,3) is vacated, and new tail is elsewhere.\n> \n> Then at that point, if head can move to (5,3), it can eat the food, provided it's still there.\n> \n> But when the tail moves away, (5,3) is free, but head may not be able to reach it immediately.\n> \n> Also, the food has life span, so we have until turn 37 to eat it.\n> \n> But let's first look at the immediate situation.\n> \n> Head at (2,4), direction U, so it can move U, D, L, R, but no instant reverse, so since current direction U, it cannot move D (down) on next turn, because that would be reverse.\n> \n> So possible moves from (2,4): U, L, R. D is not allowed because it would be opposite to current U.\n> \n> Current head direction is U, so moving D would be reverse, not allowed.\n> \n> So options: U to (2,5), L to (1,4), R to (3,4).\n> \n> But we need to check walls and obstacles.\n> \n> First, (2,5): is it wall or obstacle? Walls: border x=0,7 y=0,7, so (2,5) is within bounds. Internal obstacles: (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), (3,4), (4,4), (5,2), (5,5), (6,1). (2,5) is not in obstacles, so it's free.\n> \n> But is there food at (2,5)? Yes, food at (2,5) with value 1, life span 5.\n> \n> Also, (1,4) is an obstacle, so cannot move L to (1,4) because it's blocked.\n> \n> (1,4) is in internal obstacles: (1,4) is listed, so it's a wall cell, cannot move there.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,4) is also an internal obstacle, so cannot move R to (3,4).\n> \n> (3,4) is in obstacles: yes, (3,4) listed.\n> \n> So from (2,4), possible moves:\n> \n> - U to (2,5): available, and has food? (2,5) has food, value 1.\n> \n> - L to (1,4): but (1,4) is obstacle, so invalid.\n> \n> - R to (3,4): (3,4) is obstacle, invalid.\n> \n> - D: not allowed because reverse from U.\n> \n> So only possible move is U to (2,5).\n> \n> Is that right? Let me confirm.\n> \n> Current position: head (2,4), direction U.\n> \n> Move U: to (2,5)\n> \n> Move L: to (1,4), but (1,4) is internal obstacle, so wall, cannot move there.\n> \n> Move R: to (3,4), which is also internal obstacle, cannot move.\n> \n> Move D: to (2,3), but (2,3) is current body segment? No, moving to a body segment is only deadly if it's not the tail? Rules: body collision if head touches any body segment, except that you can move into the tail cell because tail will move.\n> \n> Rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So for D to (2,3): (2,3) is currently occupied by S1, which is not the tail; tail is at (6,3). So (2,3) is a body segment, not tail, so moving there would cause collision, death.\n> \n> Therefore, D is invalid not only because reverse but also because it's a body collision.\n> \n> Similarly, L and R are blocked by walls.\n> \n> So indeed, only possible move is U to (2,5).\n> \n> And (2,5) has food, so if we move there, we eat it, since it's positive food.\n> \n> Now, eating it: reward +1, snake grows by one.\n> \n> After eating, the snake length increases, and a new segment is added.\n> \n> But let's think about the sequence.\n> \n> At turn 30, we must move U to (2,5), as it's the only choice.\n> \n> Then, after moving to (2,5), we eat the food there, since (2,5) has food.\n> \n> So snake grows: new head at (2,5), and new segment added at the previous tail position.\n> \n> Previous snake: S0:(2,4), S1:(2,3), S2:(3,3), S3:(4,3), S4:(5,3), S5:(6,3)\n> \n> After move U to (2,5) and eating:\n> \n> New head: (2,5)\n> \n> Since ate, new segment added, so positions: new S0: (2,5), new S1: old S0 = (2,4), new S2: old S1 = (2,3), new S3: old S2 = (3,3), new S4: old S3 = (4,3), new S5: old S4 = (5,3), new S6: old S5 = (6,3)  // because we add a segment at the tail.\n> \n> When eating, the tail doesn't move; a new segment is added at the tail position.\n> \n> So after eating:\n> \n> - Head moves to new position: (2,5)\n> \n> - Body segments: previous head and body follow, and since ate, a new segment is added at the previous tail position.\n> \n> So new positions:\n> \n> - S0: (2,5)  // new head\n> \n> - S1: (2,4)  // old head\n> \n> - S2: (2,3)  // old S1\n> \n> - S3: (3,3)  // old S2\n> \n> - S4: (4,3)  // old S3\n> \n> - S5: (5,3)  // old S4\n> \n> - S6: (6,3)  // new segment, added at old tail position\n> \n> Old tail was S5 at (6,3), so new segment added there.\n> \n> Now, the food at (2,5) is eaten, so it should be removed, but in the state, we have other food.\n> \n> Also, head direction: after moving U, new head direction is U.\n> \n> Now, we need to plan for future turns.\n> \n> But since we must move U now, turn 30 action is U.\n> \n> Then for turn 31 onwards.\n> \n> First, let's list the state after turn 30 action.\n> \n> After turn 30: snake moves U to (2,5), eats food there.\n> \n> Food remaining: (4,2) with life span 3, but at turn 30, we used turn 30, so for turn 31, life span decreases.\n> \n> At turn 30, food (4,2) life span 3, so available on turn 30,31,32.\n> \n> After turn 30, if not eaten, at turn 31, life span 2.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,5) was eaten, so gone.\n> \n> (5,3) food: at turn 30, life span 8, available until turn 37.\n> \n> After turn 30 action:\n> \n> Snake positions: head (2,5), then (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3) — 7 segments.\n> \n> Head direction: U (since moved up).\n> \n> Food: (4,2) with life span now 2 for turn 31 (since at turn 30 it was 3, after turn 30, decreases to 2 for turn 31?

It's turn 30. The grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so coordinates from (0,0) to (7,7).\n> \n> Internal obstacles are: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1).

So the snake is 6 segments long, moving upwards (head direction U).\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (4,2) with life span 3, value 1 (positive food)\n> \n> - (2,5) with life span 5, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (5,3) with life span 8, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> (5,3) is listed as food, but (5,3) is also part of the snake body, since snake positions include (5,3). According to the rules, food can spawn under the body, but it can only be eaten if the body moves away and the head moves onto it.\n> \n> Here, (5,3) has food with life span 8, but it's currently occupied by the snake's body. Specifically, looking at snake positions: indices: head (2,4), then (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3). So (5,3) is the 5th segment (index 4, since head is 0).\n> \n> Since it's under the body, to eat it, the snake needs to move so that the body leaves (5,3), and then the head moves there. But that might take multiple turns.\n> \n> Also, head direction is U, so moving up.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan an action sequence for multiple turns ahead, at least 5 turns, to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n> \n> First, let's map out the grid for clarity. I'll sketch a grid.\n> \n> Grid rows y from 0 to 7, bottom to top? Usually in such games, y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top, but since head is at (2,4) and moving U, which is (x,y+1), so U increases y, so probably y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top. Similarly, x from left to right.\n> \n> So, walls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), (3,4), (4,4), (5,2), (5,5), (6,1)\n> \n> Snake: head (2,4), body (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), tail (6,3)\n> \n> Food: (4,2), (2,5), and (5,3) but (5,3) is occupied by body.\n> \n> (5,3) food has life span 8, meaning it disappears after 8 turns from now? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 30, life span 8 means it will disappear after 7 more turns? Let's see.\n> \n> Life span N: disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current. So at turn t, if life span is L, it will be gone by turn t + L. After turn t + L - 1, it should be gone? I need to be careful.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So, for example, at turn t, life span N, then at turn t+1, life span N-1, ..., at turn t + N -1, life span 1, then after that turn, it disappears, so not available on turn t + N.\n> \n> In the state, it's given as (x,y, life_span, value), so at turn 30, for (5,3) food, life span 8, so it will disappear after turn 30 + 8 = 38, meaning not available on turn 38, so last chance to eat is on turn 37.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,2) life span 3, disappear after turn 33, last eat on turn 32? Let's calculate:\n> \n> - At turn 30, life span L:\n> \n> - After turn 30, L decreases to L-1 at start of turn 31? The countdown decreases every turn including current.\n> \n> I think it's: during turn t, the food is present with life span L. After the turn, life span decreases by 1.\n> \n> So at the beginning of turn t, life span is L, it can be eaten during turn t. After turn t, if not eaten, life span becomes L-1 for turn t+1.\n> \n> If L=1 at turn t, after turn t, it disappears, so not available for turn t+1.\n> \n> Similarly, for (4,2) at turn 30, life span 3: available on turns 30, 31, 32. Disappears after turn 32, not on turn 33.\n> \n> For (2,5) life span 5: available turns 30 to 34, disappear after turn 34.\n> \n> For (5,3) life span 8: available turns 30 to 37, disappear after turn 37.\n> \n> Now, (5,3) is occupied by snake body, so it can't be eaten now. The snake needs to move so that the segment at (5,3) moves away, and then head moves to (5,3).\n> \n> Currently, snake positions: head (2,4), then (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3). So the segment at (5,3) is the 5th segment, which will move when the snake moves.\n> \n> The tail is at (6,3), so when the snake moves, the tail will leave (6,3), but (5,3) might not move immediately.\n> \n> To free up (5,3), the snake needs to move such that the body part on (5,3) moves away.\n> \n> Since the snake moves one step at a time, the body follows.\n> \n> After one move, if head moves, say, up to (2,5), then the body: the segment that was at head position moves to where head was, and so on. So after one move, the segment at (2,3) will be at (2,4), (3,3) at (2,3)? Let's trace.\n> \n> Current positions: let's index segments: S0: (2,4), S1: (2,3), S2: (3,3), S3: (4,3), S4: (5,3), S5: (6,3)\n> \n> When snake moves in direction D, new head position is current head moved in D, then each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> So after move, new S0: (x,y) based on direction, then S1: old S0, S2: old S1, etc., up to S5: old S4, and tail is gone? No, when not eating, the tail moves, so the last segment is removed, but since we're moving, the snake doesn't grow, so the tail cell is vacated.\n> \n> But for body positions, the segments shift.\n> \n> Specifically, for (5,3), which is S4, after a move, S4 will be at old S3 position, which is (4,3), and S5 will be at old S4 position (5,3), but since the snake moves, the new tail is the old S5, which was (6,3), but it moves to old S4 position? Let's clarify.\n> \n> After moving without eating:\n> \n> - New head: position based on move direction\n> \n> - New segment 1: position of old head\n> \n> - New segment 2: position of old segment 1\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - New segment k: position of old segment k-1\n> \n> - The last segment, old tail, is removed, so that cell is free.\n> \n> In this case, snake has 6 segments, positions S0 to S5.\n> \n> After move without eating:\n> \n> - New S0: moved head\n> \n> - New S1: old S0\n> \n> - New S2: old S1\n> \n> - New S3: old S2\n> \n> - New S4: old S3\n> \n> - New S5: old S4  // since there are 6 segments, new tail is old S4?

No.\n> \n> When you eat, the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move; a new segment is added at the tail position.\n> \n> Standard snake mechanics: when you eat, the head moves to the food cell, and a new segment is added at the previous tail position, so the snake grows by one.\n> \n> But in this case, if the food is under the tail, and you move the head to the tail position to eat it, then after eating, head is on that cell, and a new segment is added at the old tail position, which is the same cell, so collision.\n> \n> But the rule says: \"if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills\"\n> \n> \"Adjacent to the tail\" means head is next to the tail cell, not on it.\n> \n> For example, if tail is at T, head at H, adjacent to T, and T has food. If head moves to T to eat, then after moving, head is on T, which had food, so it eats, and since it ate, the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move, and a new segment is added at the previous tail position, which is T, but head is now on T, so head and new segment are on the same cell, collision, death.\n> \n> Yes, that makes sense.\n> \n> But in our case, for (5,3), it's currently under a body segment, not the tail.\n> \n> The tail is at (6,3).\n> \n> So to eat (5,3) food, we need to have the snake move so that (5,3) is vacated, and then head moves there.\n> \n> Since the food is under body, it will be freed when the body moves away.\n> \n> For example, if the snake moves, the segments shift, so after some moves, (5,3) might be vacated.\n> \n> Currently, at turn 30, (5,3) is S4.\n> \n> After one move without eating, new snake: head moved, S1 to S4 shift, new S5 is old S4 at (5,3), so (5,3) is now tail.\n> \n> Then if the snake moves again, without eating, the tail moves away, so (5,3) is vacated, and new tail is elsewhere.\n> \n> Then at that point, if head can move to (5,3), it can eat the food, provided it's still there.\n> \n> But when the tail moves away, (5,3) is free, but head may not be able to reach it immediately.\n> \n> Also, the food has life span, so we have until turn 37 to eat it.\n> \n> But let's first look at the immediate situation.\n> \n> Head at (2,4), direction U, so it can move U, D, L, R, but no instant reverse, so since current direction U, it cannot move D (down) on next turn, because that would be reverse.\n> \n> So possible moves from (2,4): U, L, R. D is not allowed because it would be opposite to current U.\n> \n> Current head direction is U, so moving D would be reverse, not allowed.\n> \n> So options: U to (2,5), L to (1,4), R to (3,4).\n> \n> But we need to check walls and obstacles.\n> \n> First, (2,5): is it wall or obstacle? Walls: border x=0,7 y=0,7, so (2,5) is within bounds. Internal obstacles: (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), (3,4), (4,4), (5,2), (5,5), (6,1). (2,5) is not in obstacles, so it's free.\n> \n> But is there food at (2,5)? Yes, food at (2,5) with value 1, life span 5.\n> \n> Also, (1,4) is an obstacle, so cannot move L to (1,4) because it's blocked.\n> \n> (1,4) is in internal obstacles: (1,4) is listed, so it's a wall cell, cannot move there.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,4) is also an internal obstacle, so cannot move R to (3,4).\n> \n> (3,4) is in obstacles: yes, (3,4) listed.\n> \n> So from (2,4), possible moves:\n> \n> - U to (2,5): available, and has food? (2,5) has food, value 1.\n> \n> - L to (1,4): but (1,4) is obstacle, so invalid.\n> \n> - R to (3,4): (3,4) is obstacle, invalid.\n> \n> - D: not allowed because reverse from U.\n> \n> So only possible move is U to (2,5).\n> \n> Is that right? Let me confirm.\n> \n> Current position: head (2,4), direction U.\n> \n> Move U: to (2,5)\n> \n> Move L: to (1,4), but (1,4) is internal obstacle, so wall, cannot move there.\n> \n> Move R: to (3,4), which is also internal obstacle, cannot move.\n> \n> Move D: to (2,3), but (2,3) is current body segment? No, moving to a body segment is only deadly if it's not the tail? Rules: body collision if head touches any body segment, except that you can move into the tail cell because tail will move.\n> \n> Rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So for D to (2,3): (2,3) is currently occupied by S1, which is not the tail; tail is at (6,3). So (2,3) is a body segment, not tail, so moving there would cause collision, death.\n> \n> Therefore, D is invalid not only because reverse but also because it's a body collision.\n> \n> Similarly, L and R are blocked by walls.\n> \n> So indeed, only possible move is U to (2,5).\n> \n> And (2,5) has food, so if we move there, we eat it, since it's positive food.\n> \n> Now, eating it: reward +1, snake grows by one.\n> \n> After eating, the snake length increases, and a new segment is added.\n> \n> But let's think about the sequence.\n> \n> At turn 30, we must move U to (2,5), as it's the only choice.\n> \n> Then, after moving to (2,5), we eat the food there, since (2,5) has food.\n> \n> So snake grows: new head at (2,5), and new segment added at the previous tail position.\n> \n> Previous snake: S0:(2,4), S1:(2,3), S2:(3,3), S3:(4,3), S4:(5,3), S5:(6,3)\n> \n> After move U to (2,5) and eating:\n> \n> New head: (2,5)\n> \n> Since ate, new segment added, so positions: new S0: (2,5), new S1: old S0 = (2,4), new S2: old S1 = (2,3), new S3: old S2 = (3,3), new S4: old S3 = (4,3), new S5: old S4 = (5,3), new S6: old S5 = (6,3)  // because we add a segment at the tail.\n> \n> When eating, the tail doesn't move; a new segment is added at the tail position.\n> \n> So after eating:\n> \n> - Head moves to new position: (2,5)\n> \n> - Body segments: previous head and body follow, and since ate, a new segment is added at the previous tail position.\n> \n> So new positions:\n> \n> - S0: (2,5)  // new head\n> \n> - S1: (2,4)  // old head\n> \n> - S2: (2,3)  // old S1\n> \n> - S3: (3,3)  // old S2\n> \n> - S4: (4,3)  // old S3\n> \n> - S5: (5,3)  // old S4\n> \n> - S6: (6,3)  // new segment, added at old tail position\n> \n> Old tail was S5 at (6,3), so new segment added there.\n> \n> Now, the food at (2,5) is eaten, so it should be removed, but in the state, we have other food.\n> \n> Also, head direction: after moving U, new head direction is U.\n> \n> Now, we need to plan for future turns.\n> \n> But since we must move U now, turn 30 action is U.\n> \n> Then for turn 31 onwards.\n> \n> First, let's list the state after turn 30 action.\n> \n> After turn 30: snake moves U to (2,5), eats food there.\n> \n> Food remaining: (4,2) with life span 3, but at turn 30, we used turn 30, so for turn 31, life span decreases.\n> \n> At turn 30, food (4,2) life span 3, so available on turn 30,31,32.\n> \n> After turn 30, if not eaten, at turn 31, life span 2.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,5) was eaten, so gone.\n> \n> (5,3) food: at turn 30, life span 8, available until turn 37.\n> \n> After turn 30 action:\n> \n> Snake positions: head (2,5), then (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3) — 7 segments.\n> \n> Head direction: U (since moved up).\n> \n> Food: (4,2) with life span now 2 for turn 31 (since at turn 30 it was 3, after turn 30, decreases to 2 for turn 31?

Possible moves:\n1. **U (Up)**: (3,6)\n   - Check safety: \n     - Not a wall (y=6 is valid).\n     - Not an internal obstacle.\n     - Not occupied by snake body.\n   - Valid move.\n2. **D (Down)**: (3,4)\n   - Check safety: \n     - (3,4) is an internal obstacle. **Invalid**.\n3. **R (Right)**: (4,5)\n   - Check safety:\n     - Not a wall.\n     - Not an internal obstacle.\n     - Not occupied by snake body.\n   - Valid move.\n\n### Food Considerations:\n- (4,2): Life_span 1 (disappears after Turn 32). Cannot reach it in one move from (3,5). Ignore.\n- (5,3): On tail. Cannot eat now (must wait for tail to move away). Life_span 6 (last chance: Turn 37).\n- (2,2): Life_span 9 (last chance: Turn 40). Safe to plan for later.\n\n### Path Analysis:\n#### Option 1: Move U to (3,6)\n- New head: (3,6), direction U.\n- Snake positions: [(3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3)] (tail at (4,3)).\n- Next moves:\n  - From (3,6), cannot move D (reverse). Can move U (to (3,7) → wall), L (to (2,6)), or R (to (4,6)).\n  - Moving L to (2,6) leads to potential dead-end (cannot go down from (1,6) due to obstacles).\n  - Moving R to (4,6) is safer but may lead to top-right corner (risky long-term).\n\n#### Option 2: Move R to (4,5)\n- New head: (4,5), direction R.\n- Snake positions: [(4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3)] (tail at (4,3)).\n- Next moves:\n  - From (4,5), cannot move L (reverse). Can move U (to (4,6)), D (to (4,4) → obstacle), or R (to (5,5) → obstacle).\n  - Only valid move: U to (4,6).\n    - Then from (4,6), must move R to (5,6) (other moves lead to dead-ends).\n    - This path eventually traps the snake in the top-right corner.\n\n### Decision:\nBoth options (U or R) lead to potential dead-ends, but **moving U to (3,6)** offers slightly more flexibility (can choose L or R on the next turn). Moving R forces an immediate path to the top-right corner, which is riskier. \n\n### Immediate Action:\n\\boxed{U}",
        "state": "**Current Turn**: \\( t_0 = 32 \\)\n**Cells occupied by walls**:\n\t - Border Cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7.\n\t - Internal Obstacles: [(5, 2), (4, 4), (1, 2), (1, 5), (1, 4), (3, 4), (5, 5), (6, 1)]\n**Snake Positions**:[(3, 5), (2, 5), (2, 4), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 3), (5, 3)]\n**Snake Head Direction**: R\n**Food Positions, Life Span and Value**:\n\t- (4, 2, 1, 1)\n\t- (5, 3, 6, 1)\n\t- (2, 2, 9, 1)\n> **Guidance from a Previous Thinking Model:** Turn \\( t_1 = 32 \\)\n> <think>First, I'm playing Snake on a 2D grid. The grid has walls: border cells where x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7 are walls, so I can't go there. There are also internal obstacles at (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), and (6,1). I need to avoid these.\n> \n> The snake positions are given as a list: head is at (3,5), then body segments at (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3). So the snake is 7 segments long. The head direction is right (R), meaning it's moving to the right.\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (4,2) with value 1 and life span 1. Life span 1 means it disappears after this turn if not eaten. Since life span decreases every turn including current, and current turn is 32, if I don't eat it this turn, it will be gone next turn.\n> \n> - (5,3) with value 1 and life span 6. Value 1 is positive food, so eating it increases length by 1.\n> \n> - (2,2) with value 1 and life span 9. Also positive food.\n> \n> All food has value 1, so they're all positive. No negative food here.\n> \n> I need to think 5+ turns ahead and prioritize long-term survival over immediate rewards.\n> \n> Current head position: (3,5), direction R. So from (3,5), moving right would go to (4,5).\n> \n> But let's see what cells are safe to move to. Possible moves: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), L (left, x-1), R (right, x+1).\n> \n> Since current direction is R, I cannot move left (L) next because that would be instant reverse. So forbidden moves: if current direction is R, I can't move L on the next turn. But I can move U, D, or R.\n> \n> Now, let's list possible actions for turn t1=32.\n> \n> Current head: (3,5)\n> \n> - Move U: to (3,6). But y=6? Grid y from 0 to 7, so y=6 is within bounds. Walls: y=0 and y=7 are borders, so y=6 is not a wall. Internal obstacles: check if (3,6) is an obstacle. Obstacles are at (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1). (3,6) is not in that list, so should be safe, but I need to check if it's occupied by the snake or not.\n> \n> Snake positions: (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3). So (3,6) is not occupied by snake, and not a wall, so moving U to (3,6) should be possible.\n> \n> - Move D: to (3,4). Now, is (3,4) safe? Internal obstacles include (3,4), yes! (3,4) is listed as an internal obstacle. So moving D to (3,4) is into a wall, deadly collision. Cannot move D.\n> \n> - Move L: to (2,5). But current direction is R, moving L would be opposite, so instant reverse, not allowed. Cannot move L.\n> \n> - Move R: to (4,5). Is (4,5) safe? Not a border wall, not in internal obstacles: obstacles are (5,2), (4,4), etc. (4,5) not listed, so no obstacle. Snake positions: (4,5) is not occupied; snake is at (3,5), (2,5), etc., (4,5) not there. So moving R to (4,5) should be safe.\n> \n> (4,5) is not occupied; let's list all snake segments: (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3). So (4,5) is free.\n> \n> Also, food at (4,2), but that's different.\n> \n> So for turn 32, possible moves: U to (3,6), R to (4,5). D and L are not possible.\n> \n> Now, I need to think about food.\n> \n> Food at (4,2): value 1, life span 1. Since life span 1, it disappears after this turn. So if I don't eat it now, it's gone.\n> \n> But to eat it, I need to move head to (4,2) this turn.\n> \n> Current head is at (3,5), (4,2) is not adjacent; it's down-left or something. From (3,5) to (4,2): delta x=+1, delta y=-3, so not adjacent. I can't move directly there in one step.\n> \n> Possible moves are only U or R this turn, to (3,6) or (4,5). Neither is (4,2), so I cannot eat the food at (4,2) this turn. It will disappear after this turn since life span 1, and we're on turn 32, so after this turn, it's gone. So I should ignore this food; it's not reachable.\n> \n> Food at (5,3): value 1, life span 6. Position (5,3). Snake positions include (5,3), which is the tail? Snake positions: head (3,5), then (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3). So (5,3) is the last segment, the tail.\n> \n> But food is at (5,3), and the snake is already on it? Food can spawn under the body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves onto it.\n> \n> Currently, food is at (5,3), and tail is at (5,3), so it's under the tail segment.\n> \n> To eat it, I need the tail to move away, and then head to move onto (5,3).\n> \n> But the tail moves when the snake moves forward. When the head moves to a new cell, and if it eats food, a new segment is added, so the tail doesn't move. Otherwise, tail moves forward.\n> \n> Standard snake mechanics: when head moves to a cell, if it has food, snake grows, so tail stays; else, tail moves to the next segment.\n> \n> But here, for food under the body, it can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves in.\n> \n> Specifically: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> In this case, food is at (5,3), which is currently occupied by the tail segment. So if the snake moves, and the tail moves away, then (5,3) becomes empty, and if the head moves onto it later, it can eat the food.\n> \n> But life span is 6, so it has a few turns.\n> \n> Food at (2,2): value 1, life span 9.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan a sequence of actions for multiple turns, at least 5 turns ahead.\n> \n> Start from turn 32.\n> \n> Current head at (3,5), direction R.\n> \n> Possible actions: U or R.\n> \n> If I move U to (3,6), new head position (3,6), direction U.\n> \n> Then the snake body: the head moves to (3,6), so new positions: head (3,6), then previous head (3,5) becomes body, then (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), and tail (5,3). But since no food eaten, tail moves away, so the segment at (5,3) is removed, tail is now at (4,3)? Let's think.\n> \n> After move: head to new position, then the body follows. So if head moves to (3,6), positions become: [(3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3)] and the tail (5,3) is gone because we didn't eat food, so snake length remains 7, but positions shift.\n> \n> Original positions: indices: 0: (3,5) head, 1: (2,5), 2: (2,4), 3: (2,3), 4: (3,3), 5: (4,3), 6: (5,3) tail.\n> \n> After moving head to (3,6) without eating food: new head at (3,6), then body segments: the first body segment is the old head (3,5), then (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), and the tail (5,3) is dropped, so new positions: [(3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3)] with tail at (4,3).\n> \n> If I move R to (4,5), new head at (4,5), then body: (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), and tail (5,3) dropped, so positions: [(4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3)] tail at (4,3).\n> \n> Now, food at (5,3) is still there, but now the cell (5,3) is empty because tail moved away. But head is not on it.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (2,2) and (4,2) but (4,2) will be gone after this turn.\n> \n> After turn 32, food at (4,2) disappears.\n> \n> Now, I need to consider eating the food at (5,3) or (2,2).\n> \n> But (5,3) has life span 6, so it will last until turn 32 + 6 - 1? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 32, life span 1 for (4,2) means it disappears after turn 32, so on turn 33 it's gone.\n> \n> Similarly, for (5,3), life span 6 at turn 32, so it decreases to 5 on turn 33, 4 on 34, ..., down to 0 on turn 37, so it disappears after turn 37. So it can be eaten from turn 32 to turn 37.\n> \n> Turn 32: life span 6, can be eaten if head moves to it.\n> \n> But currently on turn 32, head is at (3,5), (5,3) is not adjacent, so cannot eat now.\n> \n> After moving, on turn 33, etc.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,2) life span 9 at turn 32, so disappears after turn 40 (32+9-1=40? Let's calculate: life span N at turn t, disappears after N turns, including current, so last chance to eat is on turn t + N - 1.\n> \n> For example, (4,2) life span 1 at t=32, last chance to eat is turn 32, disappears after.\n> \n> (5,3) life span 6 at t=32, last chance to eat is turn 32 + 6 - 1 = 37.\n> \n> (2,2) life span 9 at t=32, last chance to eat is turn 32 + 9 - 1 = 40.\n> \n> Now, also, there's a danger: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> But in this case, the tail is at (5,3), and food is on it, so if I eat it, I grow, but since it's the tail, after eating, the tail doesn't move, so head is on (5,3) and the new tail is still (5,3)? No.\n> \n> When you eat food, you grow, so a new segment is added at the tail position, so the tail doesn't move; the head moves to the food cell, and a new segment is added where the tail was, so the tail becomes the new segment.\n> \n> Standard: if head moves to food cell, the snake grows, so the tail stays in place, and a new segment is added at the tail position, so the tail position remains the same, but now it's part of the body, and the new tail is the previous segment or something.\n> \n> Let's clarify.\n> \n> Typically: when head moves to a cell with food, the snake length increases by one. The head occupies the food cell, and the body follows, but the tail does not move; a new segment is added at the end, so the tail position remains, and it becomes the second last segment, with the new segment at the old tail position.\n> \n> But in terms of positions, when head eats food, positions: new head at food cell, then the previous head, body, ..., up to the tail, and then a new segment is added at the tail position, so the tail position stays the same.\n> \n> For example, suppose tail at T, head moves to F where F is food, then new positions: head at F, then old head, body, ..., old tail, and new segment at old tail position, so tail is still at T, but now it's not the end; the new segment is at T, so tail is at T.\n> \n> Perhaps it's better not to overcomplicate.\n> \n> In this case, for the food at (5,3), which is the current tail, if I move head to (5,3) and eat it, then since it's positive food, snake grows: head moves to (5,3), and a new segment is added at the old tail position, which is (5,3), but (5,3) is where head is, so it would be head at (5,3), and a new segment at (5,3)? That doesn't make sense; collision immediately.\n> \n> I think I have a mistake.\n> \n> When head moves to a cell, if it has food, the snake grows, so the tail does not move. That means the position that was tail remains occupied, and head moves to the new cell.\n> \n> But if the food is under the tail, and head moves to that cell, it's the same cell as tail, so moving head to (5,3) when tail is at (5,3) would mean head and tail are on the same cell, which is a collision.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n> \n> In this case, if head is adjacent to tail, and tail has food, eating that food causes a problem.\n> \n> But here, the food is on the tail cell, so if head moves to tail cell to eat it, head is moving directly to the tail cell, which might cause collision.\n> \n> Let's read carefully.\n> \n> \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> For food under the tail, when the tail moves away, the cell is free, then head can move onto it to eat.\n> \n> In this case, on turn 32, food is at (5,3), occupied by tail. After the snake moves (without eating other food), the tail moves away, so (5,3) becomes free, and food is still there. Then on a subsequent turn, if head moves to (5,3), it can eat the food.\n> \n> But when it eats, since it's positive food, snake grows: head moves to (5,3), and a new segment is added at the position where the tail was before the move. But at the time of eating, the tail has moved, so the new segment is added at the current tail position.\n> \n> Suppose at turn t, tail is at T, food at T.\n> \n> After move at turn t, tail moves to new position, so T is free, food at T is exposed.\n> \n> Then at turn t+1, if head moves to T, it eats the food. At that time, the tail is somewhere else, say T_new.\n> \n> When head eats food at T, the snake grows: head moves to T, then the body follows, and a new segment is added at the current tail position T_new, so the tail stays at T_new, and a new segment is added there, so no immediate collision.\n> \n> But the danger is when head is adjacent to tail and the tail cell has food.\n> \n> In this case, for (5,3), after the tail moves, it's not adjacent to head immediately.\n> \n> Let's see the positions.\n> \n> After turn 32, if I move U or R, the tail moves away from (5,3), so (5,3) is free with food.\n> \n> Then head can later move to (5,3) to eat it.\n> \n> But when I eat it, I grow, so the tail doesn't move that turn, but since the tail was not adjacent, it should be fine.\n> \n> The specific danger is if head is adjacent to tail, and I eat the food on the tail cell, then after eating, head is on the food cell, and a new segment is added at tail, so head and new segment are adjacent or same? It might cause collision if not careful.\n> \n> The rule says: \"because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n> \n> Let's parse the rule: \"If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n> \n> When you eat the food on the tail cell, head moves to tail cell, but tail cell was occupied by tail, so moving head to tail cell would cause head to collide with tail segment, which is deadly.\n> \n> Yes, that's the point.\n> \n> If the food is on the tail cell, and head is not on it, but if head moves to it to eat, since tail is on that cell, head moving to a cell occupied by body (tail is a body segment) causes collision, so you die immediately.\n> \n> Therefore, you can only eat food on tail cell after the tail has moved away.\n> \n> In the rule, it says the body must move away first.\n> \n> In this case, for (5,3), it is currently occupied by tail, so I cannot eat it now; I must wait for the tail to move away.\n> \n> After the snake moves on turn 32, tail moves, (5,3) free, then I can eat it later.\n> \n> Similarly for other body segments.\n> \n> But for tail, it's clear.\n> \n> Back to planning.\n> \n> First, for turn 32, I can move U or R.\n> \n> Let me consider the grid to plan ahead.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.

It's turn 33, and I'm playing Snake on a 8x8 grid since the borders are x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7. Walls are at the borders and also internal obstacles at: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1).\n> \n> Snake positions: Head at (3,6), then body segments at (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3). So the snake is 7 segments long. Head direction is Up, meaning it moved to (3,6) from (3,5) since it was moving upwards.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (5,3) with value 1 and life span 6\n> \n> - (2,2) with value 1 and life span 8\n> \n> Both are positive food since value is +1. Life span means they disappear after that many turns, including the current turn. So for (5,3), it has 6 turns left, including turn 33, so it will disappear after turn 38. Similarly, (2,2) has 8 turns left, disappearing after turn 40.\n> \n> I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks. Prioritize long-term survival over immediate rewards.\n> \n> Possible moves: I can go Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). But I can't instantly reverse, so since current head direction is Up, I cannot go Down on the next turn. So from (3,6), possible moves:\n> \n> - Up: to (3,7). But y=7 is the top border, and walls are at y=0 and y=7, so (3,7) is a wall cell. Cannot move there.\n> \n> - Down: to (3,5). But (3,5) is the second segment of the snake. Moving to a body segment is deadly unless it's the tail and we're moving into it as the tail moves away.\n> \n> Let's check the snake positions: head at (3,6), then (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3). So (3,5) is directly below the head and is occupied by the body. If I move down to (3,5), that's a collision with the body, which is deadly. The rule says: body collision (head touches any body segment), except that you can move into the cell occupied by the tail segment since the tail will move forward.\n> \n> (3,5) is not the tail; the tail is at (4,3). (3,5) is the neck, so moving there would cause a collision. Therefore, Down is not possible.\n> \n> - Left: to (2,6). Is this valid? Let's see if there's a wall or body.\n> \n> Walls: internal obstacles include (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), etc., but (2,6) doesn't seem to be a wall. Borders are x=0 and x=7, so x=2 is within bounds. y=6 is between 0 and 7. Also, snake positions: (2,6) is not occupied by the snake. Snake is at (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), etc. (2,6) is empty. So Left to (2,6) seems possible.\n> \n> - Right: to (4,6). Similarly, check walls: internal obstacles have (4,4), but (4,6) is not listed. x=4, y=6 should be fine. Snake not there. So Right to (4,6) possible.\n> \n> But head direction is Up, and I'm considering Left or Right, which are not reverse, so that's fine. Down is reverse and also deadly, so invalid.

Life span N, disappears after N turns including current, so if life span is 6, and current turn 33, it will be gone at turn 39? Let's clarify.\n> \n> The rule: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So for food at (5,3) with life span 6 on turn 33, on turn 33, countdown=6, after turn 33 it becomes 5, ..., down to 0, and when countdown reaches 0, it disappears. I think it disappears at the end of the turn when countdown reaches 0.\n> \n> Typically, it might be that after N turns, it's gone.

But for planning, I need to know how many turns it will be present.\n> \n> For (5,3): life span 6, current turn 33. So on turn 33, countdown=6; turn 34, countdown=5; ... turn 38, countdown=0, so it disappears after turn 38, meaning not available on turn 39.

That's left and down. But there are obstacles and the snake body.\n> \n> Path to (2,2): from (3,6) to (2,6) then to? (2,6) to (2,5) but (2,5) is occupied by snake body. Snake has (2,5), which is the third segment.\n> \n> If I go to (2,6), then from there, I can go Down to (2,5)? But (2,5) is body, so collision unless it's the tail.\n> \n> Current tail is (4,3), so (2,5) is not tail, it's body, so moving to (2,5) would be deadly.\n> \n> From (2,6), I could go Left to (1,6), but x=1, y=6. Is there a wall? Internal obstacles: (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), but (1,6) is not listed, so it might be free. Borders: x=0 is wall, but x=1 is not border, so should be ok.\n> \n> Then from (1,6), I can go Down to (1,5), but (1,5) is an internal obstacle!

It's turn 34, and I'm playing Snake on a grid. The walls are defined: border cells at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the grid is from (0,0) to (7,7), but since borders are walls, I can only move within x=1 to x=6 and y=1 to y=6? Let me confirm.\n> \n> The border walls are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the playable area should be from (1,1) to (6,6), I think. But there are also internal obstacles: [(5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1)]. So I need to avoid those cells too.\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (4,6), then (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3). So the snake has 7 segments. Head direction is R, which is right, so moving east.\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (5,3) with life_span=5, value=1 (positive)\n> \n> - (2,2) with life_span=7, value=1 (positive)\n> \n> - (5,4) with life_span=10, value=1 (positive)\n> \n> All food is positive, no negative food here. Value=1 for all, and life_span decreases each turn.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan an action sequence for at least 5 turns ahead, but since food has life spans, I should consider when they disappear. Turn t1=34, so:\n> \n> - Food at (5,3): life_span=5, so disappears after turn 34+5=39? Life_span decreases every turn including current, so if life_span=N, it disappears after N turns from now.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So for food at turn t with life_span L, it will disappear after turn t + L - 1? Let's clarify.\n> \n> If countdown decreases every turn including current, at turn t, if life_span is L, then:\n> \n> - After turn t, countdown becomes L-1\n> \n> - After turn t+1, L-2\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - After turn t + (L-1), countdown becomes 0, and it disappears before turn t + L? I need to be careful.\n> \n> Typically in such games, if life_span is L at turn t, it means it will be present for L more turns, including turn t. So after turn t + L - 1, it disappears before turn t + L.\n> \n> For example, at turn t, life_span L: it can be eaten on turns t, t+1, ..., up to turn t + L - 1. On turn t + L, it's gone.\n> \n> Similarly here: for food at (5,3) with life_span=5 at turn 34:\n> \n> - Can be eaten on turns 34, 35, 36, 37, 38. Disappears before turn 39.\n> \n> Food at (2,2) life_span=7: can be eaten turns 34 to 40.\n> \n> Food at (5,4) life_span=10: turns 34 to 43.\n> \n> All have value=1, so positive.\n> \n> Now, snake head is at (4,6), direction R (right). So possible moves: since direction is R, I can go U (up), D (down), R (right), but not L (left) because that would be instant reverse, which is not allowed. Rule: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\"\n> \n> Current direction is R, so I cannot move L on this turn.

It's turn 36, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid is from (0,0) to (7,7), and walls are the borders, meaning I can't go to x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7. Also, there are internal obstacles at: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1). I should list all obstacles to avoid.\n> \n> Obstacles: borders plus these points:\n> \n> - (5,2)\n> \n> - (4,4)\n> \n> - (1,2)\n> \n> - (1,5)\n> \n> - (1,4)\n> \n> - (3,4)\n> \n> - (5,5)\n> \n> - (6,1)\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (6,6), then (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4). So the snake is 7 segments long. Head direction is R, which is right, so moving east.\n> \n> Food:\n> \n> - (5,3) with value 1, life span 3 (so it disappears after 3 turns, including this one? Life span decreases every turn, so if life span is 3 on turn 36, it will be gone after turn 38? Let me clarify.\n> \n> Life span: \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So for food at (5,3), life span 3 on turn 36. That means:\n> \n> - Turn 36: life span 3\n> \n> - Turn 37: life span 2\n> \n> - Turn 38: life span 1\n> \n> - Turn 39: gone? But \"disappears after N turns\", so if N=3 on turn 36, it should disappear after turn 38, meaning it's not there on turn 39. Similarly, life span decreases each turn, so on turn t, if life span is L, it will be present for L more turns, including turn t. So it disappears on turn t + L.\n> \n> For (5,3): life span 3 on turn 36, so it disappears after turn 38, meaning last chance to eat is turn 38.\n> \n> Similarly:\n> \n> - (2,2) value 1, life span 5: disappears after turn 40 (36+4?

Walls at borders, so cells (0,y) for all y, (7,y) for all y, (x,0) for all x, (x,7) for all x.

(6,5) is within bounds, x=6 not 0 or 7, y=5 not 0 or 7. Internal obstacles: (6,1) is obstacle, but (6,5) not listed, so should be free. But is it occupied by snake? Snake positions: (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4). (6,5) not in list, so empty. So D to (6,5) is possible.\n> \n> - R: (7,6) — x=7 is wall, so collision. Cannot go R.\n> \n> - L: but cannot, because current direction R, no instant reverse. Even if I could, (5,6) is the body segment, but since tail will move, it might be ok? Rule: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\" But in this case, moving L to (5,6) which is the first body segment.\n> \n> Snake positions: head (6,6), then (5,6) is the next segment. If I move L to (5,6), that's where the body is. But after move, head moves to (5,6), and the tail will move, so the segment that was at (5,6) will move to where? When snake moves, head goes to new position, each body segment moves to previous position of the segment before it.\n> \n> If I move left to (5,6), which is currently occupied by the first body segment. After move, head is at (5,6), and the body segment that was at (5,6) will move to the new position, but since head moved to (5,6), which was body, but now it's head, and the tail end will be cut off or something? No, when snake moves without eating, the tail moves forward, so the last segment is removed.\n> \n> Specifically: if no food eaten, snake moves head to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, and the tail segment is removed. So the cell that was tail becomes empty.\n> \n> But if I move head to a cell that was occupied by a body segment, it could cause collision only if it's not the tail and it doesn't move away, but since the body moves, it might be ok.\n> \n> Rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, moving to the tail cell is safe because the tail moves away. But moving to a non-tail body cell is deadly because that segment doesn't move away immediately; it only moves when the snake moves, so if head moves to a body cell, it collides.\n> \n> In this case, (5,6) is the first body segment, not the tail. Tail is (2,4). So if I move to (5,6), which is occupied by body, it's a collision, deadly. Cannot go L.\n> \n> Similarly, U is wall, R is wall, so only possible move is D to (6,5).\n> \n> Is that right? U: (6,7) y=7 wall, yes.\n> \n> R: (7,6) x=7 wall, yes.\n> \n> L: (5,6) body, collision, not tail, so deadly.\n> \n> D: (6,5) — let's confirm: not wall, not body, not obstacle. Body positions: (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4). (6,5) not there. Obstacles: (6,1) is obstacle, but (6,5) not. So yes, only D is possible.\n> \n> But that seems too constrained. Let me double-check.\n> \n> Snake head at (6,6), direction R.\n> \n> Possible moves: U, D, R, but R to (7,6) is x=7 wall, invalid.\n> \n> U to (6,7) is y=7 wall, invalid.\n> \n> L to (5,6) is body segment, and since it's not the tail (tail is (2,4)), it would be collision, so invalid.\n> \n> D to (6,5) is empty, no wall, so valid.\n> \n> So for turn 36, I must go D to (6,5).\n> \n> But I need to think ahead for multiple turns.\n> \n> After moving to (6,5), what next?\n> \n> Also, food: (5,3) is below, but I need to get to it.\n> \n> (5,3) is at y=3, x=5.\n> \n> From (6,5), if I go D, head to (6,5).\n> \n> Then on turn 37, head at (6,5), direction?

Not wall, not obstacle? Obstacles: (6,1) is obstacle, (6,4) not listed, so should be free. Snake: after move, snake positions will be: head (6,5), then body: previous head was (6,6), so body segments: (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), but tail (2,4) is removed since no food eaten? When snake moves without eating, tail is removed.\n> \n> On turn 36: snake positions: [(6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4)] — 7 segments.\n> \n> After moving D to (6,5): new head (6,5), then body: the first body segment moves to previous head position (6,6), but since head moved to (6,5), the new body is: (6,6) becomes the first body segment, then (5,6) becomes second, (4,6) third, (3,6) fourth, (3,5) fifth, (2,5) sixth, and (2,4) is removed because no food, so tail is gone. New tail is (2,5)? Let's list:\n> \n> New positions: head at (6,5)\n> \n> Then the segments: the segment that was at (6,6) moves to where? Standard snake movement: when head moves to new cell, each subsequent segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> So:\n> \n> - Head was (6,6), moves to (6,5)\n> \n> - Segment 1 (was at (5,6)) moves to where head was, (6,6)\n> \n> - Segment 2 (was at (4,6)) moves to where segment 1 was, (5,6)\n> \n> - Segment 3 (was at (3,6)) moves to where segment 2 was, (4,6)\n> \n> - Segment 4 (was at (3,5)) moves to where segment 3 was? No, segments: positions are ordered.\n> \n> Snake positions after move: head to new position (6,5)\n> \n> Then body: the first body segment is the old head position, so (6,6) becomes body.\n> \n> Then the second body segment moves to the old position of the first body segment, which was (5,6)\n> \n> Similarly, third to (4,6), fourth to (3,6), fifth to (3,5), sixth to (2,5), and the tail (2,4) is not included, so new snake: [(6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5)] — tail is (2,5), length 7 still? No, since no food, length decreases? No, when no food eaten, the snake moves, head to new, tail is removed, so length decreases by one? But in the rules, it says for negative food, length unchanged, but for no food, I think length decreases? No.\n> \n> Rule: \"Positive Food: Length of snake +1\", \"Negative Food: Length of snake unchanged\", but when no food eaten, the snake should shorten, I think? Let me check.\n> \n> In standard snake, when no food eaten, snake moves, head to new, tail moves off, so length remains the same, but the tail cell is vacated.\n> \n> Length remains the same until food is eaten.\n> \n> In the rules, it doesn't specify, but from description: \"the tail will move forward\" implies that without eating, tail moves, so length unchanged. Only when eating positive food, length increases.\n> \n> For example, in initial state, snake has positions, after move without eating, the last position is removed, so length same.\n> \n> In this case, from 7 segments, after move to (6,5), new positions: head (6,5), then body: (6,6) [old head], (5,6) [old seg1], (4,6) [old seg2], (3,6) [old seg3], (3,5) [old seg4], (2,5) [old seg5], and (2,4) is not included, so segments: (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5) — that's 7 positions? Old positions: 1 head, 6 body? List indices.\n> \n> Turn 36: positions index 0: head (6,6), 1: (5,6), 2: (4,6), 3: (3,6), 4: (3,5), 5: (2,5), 6: tail (2,4)\n> \n> After moving down to (6,5): new head at (6,5)\n> \n> New body: segment 1: position of old head, (6,6)\n> \n> Segment 2: position of old segment 1, (5,6)\n> \n> Segment 3: position of old segment 2, (4,6)\n> \n> Segment 4: position of old segment 3, (3,6)\n> \n> Segment 5: position of old segment 4, (3,5)\n> \n> Segment 6: position of old segment 5, (2,5)\n> \n> Old segment 6 (tail) is not moved to; it is removed. So new snake has head and 6 body segments? Positions: new index 0: (6,5), 1: (6,6), 2: (5,6), 3: (4,6), 4: (3,6), 5: (3,5), 6: (2,5) — but (2,5) was previously segment 5, now it's segment 6, and (2,4) is gone. So 7 segments, same length. Yes, length unchanged without eating.\n> \n> Tail is now (2,5).\n> \n> Back to turn 37: head at (6,5), direction down (since I moved down).\n> \n> Possible moves:\n> \n> - D: to (6,4)\n> \n> - L: to (5,5)\n> \n> - R: to (7,5) x=7 wall, invalid\n> \n> - U: to (6,6) but (6,6) is now body segment, and it's not the tail (tail is (2,5)), so collision, deadly. Cannot go U.\n> \n> So possible: D to (6,4) or L to (5,5).\n> \n> Now, (6,4): is it free? Not wall, not obstacle (obstacles include (6,1) but not (6,4)), not snake: snake positions at turn 37: head (6,5), body (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), so (6,4) not occupied.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,5): is it free? Obstacles: (5,5) is listed as internal obstacle? Internal obstacles: (5,5) is one of them: from list, (5,5) is an obstacle, so cannot go there.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: [(5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1)]\n> \n> Yes, (5,5) is an obstacle, so L to (5,5) is invalid, collision.\n> \n> Therefore, from (6,5), only possible move is D to (6,4).\n> \n> Then on turn 38, head at (6,4), direction down.\n> \n> Possible moves:\n> \n> - D: to (6,3)\n> \n> - L: to (5,4)\n> \n> - R: to (7,4) wall, invalid\n> \n> - U: to (6,5) but (6,5) is body (since after previous move, body includes (6,5)? Let's see snake positions after turn 37 move.\n> \n> After turn 37 move to (6,4): head to (6,4)\n> \n> Body: old head (6,5) becomes segment 1, then (6,6) seg2, (5,6) seg3, (4,6) seg4, (3,6) seg5, (3,5) seg6, and tail (2,5) removed? Positions: new head (6,4), then body (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5) — and (2,5) gone, tail is (3,5)?

So snake: [(6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5)] tail at (3,5).\n> \n> Now turn 38, head at (6,4), direction down.\n> \n> Possible moves:\n> \n> - D: to (6,3)\n> \n> - L: to (5,4)\n> \n> - R: to (7,4) wall, invalid\n> \n> - U: to (6,5) but (6,5) is body segment, not tail (tail is (3,5)), so collision, invalid.\n> \n> So possible: D to (6,3) or L to (5,4).\n> \n> Now, (6,3): free? Not wall, not obstacle, not snake. Snake has (6,4), (6,5), etc., but (6,3) not occupied.\n> \n> (5,4): free? Obstacles: (5,4) not listed, but food at (5,4)? Food is at (5,3), (2,2), (5,4). (5,4) is food position? Food: (5,4,8,1) so (5,4) has food.\n> \n> But food can be on a cell, and I can move to it to eat, as long as not collision.\n> \n> First, (5,4) is not wall, not obstacle, and not snake? Snake positions: (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), so (5,4) not occupied, so I can move to (5,4) to eat the food.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,3) is free, no food there.\n> \n> But (5,3) has food, but that's separate.\n> \n> For turn 38, from (6,4), I can go to (6,3) or (5,4).\n> \n> If I go to (5,4), I eat the food at (5,4), which is positive, so length increases, and I get +1.\n> \n> If I go to (6,3), no food.\n> \n> Now, I need to think ahead.\n> \n> Also, food at (5,3) has life span 3 on turn 36, so available until turn 38, disappears on 39. So on turn 38, it's still there, life span 1? Turn 36: L=3, turn 37: L=2, turn 38: L=1, gone on 39. So on turn 38, I can eat (5,3) if I go there.\n> \n> But (5,3) is at (5,3), which is below.\n> \n> Now, from current position on turn 38 head at (6,4), if I go L to (5,4), I eat (5,4), then head at (5,4), and since I ate, the tail doesn't move, so snake grows: new head at (5,4), body: the previous positions include (6,4) which becomes body, but since I ate, the tail is not removed, so positions: head (5,4), then old head (6,4) becomes first body, then (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5), and tail (3,5) remains, so length 8 now.\n> \n> Then direction: I moved L, so direction left.\n> \n> If I go D to (6,3), no eat, head to (6,3), body (6,4), (6,5), etc., tail removed, so positions: head (6,3), body (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), and (3,5) removed? After move, new head (6,3), body seg1 (6,4) [old head], seg2 (6,5), seg3 (6,6), seg4 (5,6), seg5 (4,6), seg6 (3,6), and old tail (3,5) removed, so tail (3,6).\n> \n> Direction down.\n> \n> Now, to maximize score, I should eat food, but avoid risks.\n> \n> Food at (5,3) is available only on turn 38, since life span.\n> \n> Turn 38 is the last chance to eat (5,3).\n> \n> (5,4) has life span 8, so many turns left.\n> \n> (2,2) has life span 5, available until turn 40.\n> \n> From turn 38 position, if I am at (6,4), and I go to (5,4), I eat (5,4), and I'm at (5,4) on turn 38.\n> \n> Then on turn 39, head at (5,4), direction L.\n> \n> Possible moves: since direction L, I can go L, U, D, not R (reverse).\n> \n> - L: to (4,4) but (4,4) is internal obstacle, cannot go.\n> \n> - U: to (5,5) but (5,5) is obstacle, cannot.\n> \n> - D: to (5,3)\n> \n> - R: cannot, reverse.\n> \n> So only D to (5,3) is possible? (5,3) has food, and it's available on turn 38, but on turn 39, it's gone? Turn 38: (5,3) L=1, so on turn 38 it's there, but after turn 38, on turn 39, it disappears.\n> \n> Life span: on turn t, if L, available on that turn.

From (6,4), possible moves are to (6,3) or (5,4), not directly to (5,3) because not adjacent? Adjacent cells: up, down, left, right. From (6,4), (5,3) is down-left, not direct adjacent; it's diagonal, not allowed. Only orthogonal moves.\n> \n> So from (6,4), I can only go to (6,3) or (5,4), not to (5,3) directly.\n> \n> Therefore, to eat (5,3) on turn 38, I need to be at a position where I can move to (5,3) on turn 38.\n> \n> On turn 38, head is at (6,4), and (5,3) is adjacent?

Cannot reach it directly from (6, 4) (not adjacent orthogonally). Will disappear after this turn.\n   - (5, 4): Life span 6. Can be eaten now or later.\n   - Other foods are too far to consider for immediate action.\n\n4. **Immediate Decision**:\n   - **Option 1: Move L to (5, 4)**:\n     - Eat the food (+1 score, length increases to 8).\n     - Next moves: From (5, 4), must move D to (5, 3) (other directions blocked by walls or body).\n     - From (5, 3), can move L to (4, 3) to avoid trapping.\n   - **Option 2: Move D to (6, 3)**:\n     - No food eaten.\n     - Next moves: From (6, 3), must move L to (5, 3) (moving D to (6, 2) leads to a dead end).\n     - From (5, 3), can move L to (4, 3).\n\n### Optimal Choice\n- **Move L to (5, 4)** is better because:\n  - It immediately scores +1.\n  - The subsequent path (D to (5, 3), then L to (4, 3)) is safe and allows for future movement towards other foods (e.g., (2, 6)).\n\n### Action Sequence\n- **Turn 38**: Move L to (5, 4) (eat food).\n- **Turn 39**: Move D to (5, 3).\n- **Turn 40**: Move L to (4, 3).\n\n### Final Answer\n\\boxed{L}",

It's turn 38, and the grid is 8x8 since borders are x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7. Walls include the borders and internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1).\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (6,4), then body: (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5). So the snake is 7 segments long. Head direction is D, meaning down, which is decreasing y. Since y decreases when moving down, from (6,4) moving down would go to (6,3), but let's confirm the coordinates.\n> \n> In grid terms, typically, (0,0) is bottom-left or top-left? The problem doesn't specify, but since moving down decreases y, it might be that y=0 is the bottom or top? Let's see the movement: U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), so if U increases y, it might be that y increases upwards, so (x,0) could be the bottom row. But in the snake positions, head at (6,4), body at (6,5) and (6,6), so (6,6) has higher y, so if U is (x,y+1), that means moving up increases y, so y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top? Let's check the walls.\n> \n> Walls: border cells x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Snake head at (6,4), moving down to (x,y-1) would be (6,3). But body is at (6,5) and (6,6), which are above if y increases upwards. Yes, so (6,6) is the top part, y=6 is high, moving down decreases y.\n> \n> Head direction is D, down, so last move was down to (6,4). Now, I can move U, D, L, R, but no instant reverse. Since head direction is D, I cannot move U (up) on this turn, because that would be opposite to current direction.\n> \n> Current head direction is D, so I cannot move U immediately. Possible moves are D, L, R. But I need to see which are safe.\n> \n> Now, food positions:\n> \n> - (5,3) value 1, life span 1 (so disappears after this turn if not eaten? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 38, life span 1 means it will disappear after this turn, so must be eaten now or never.\n> \n> Life span: disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current. So for food at (5,3), life span 1 at turn 38. After turn 38, countdown to 0, so it disappears. So to eat it, must move to (5,3) on turn 38.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,2) value 1, life span 3, so has 3 turns left including turn 38, so will disappear after turn 40? Let's think.\n> \n> Life span N at turn t means it will be there for N more turns, including turn t. So after N turns, it disappears. For example, life span 1 at turn t: present at turn t, disappears after turn t, so must be eaten on turn t.\n> \n> Life span 3 at turn t: present at turn t, t+1, t+2; disappears after turn t+2.\n> \n> So:\n> \n> - (5,3): life span 1, must eat on turn 38 or gone.\n> \n> - (2,2): life span 3, can be eaten on turn 38, 39, or 40; disappears after turn 40.\n> \n> - (5,4): life span 6, can be eaten from turn 38 to 43.\n> \n> - (2,6): life span 9, many turns.\n> \n> Also, all food has value 1, so all positive food? Value is +1 for all, according to the list: value1, value2, etc., all 1? Let's see: \"value1,1\" for (5,3), similarly others, all value 1 and life span given.\n> \n> In the input: (5,3,1,1) – I think this is (x,y,value,life_span), so (5,3) value=1, life_span=1.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,2,3,1) – value=1? No, it says \"value2, life_span2\" but in the list, it's written as ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 ), so for (2,2) it's value=1? Let's read carefully.\n> \n> \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span:\n> - ( (5,3), 1, 1 )\n> - ( (2,2), 1, 3 )\n> - ( (5,4), 1, 6 )\n> - ( (2,6), 1, 9 )\"\n> \n> In the text: \" (5, 3, 1, 1) \" it might be abbreviated, but from context, it's (x,y,value,life_span). And all values are 1, so all positive food. No negative food here.\n> \n> But in the rules, there is negative food, but in this state, all food is +1, so good.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (6,4), direction D.\n> \n> Possible moves: cannot move U (reverse), so can move D, L, or R.\n> \n> - D: down to (6,3)\n> \n> - L: left to (5,4)\n> \n> - R: right to (7,4)\n> \n> But need to check walls and collisions.\n> \n> First, walls: border x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.

(5,4) is a food position? Food at (5,4) is present, but (5,4) might not be occupied by snake or wall.\n> \n> Snake positions: head (6,4), body (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5)\n> \n> So (5,4) is not in snake body, and not a wall? Walls: internal obstacles include (5,5), but not (5,4).

Snake: (6,4) head, body from (6,5) to (3,5), so (6,3) not occupied. Walls: (6,1) is wall, but (6,3) not listed, so free.\n> \n> But (6,3) might be accessible.\n> \n> Now, food at (5,3) must be eaten this turn or gone.\n> \n> (5,3) is adjacent to head? Head at (6,4), so (5,3) is diagonally? Adjacent cells: (6,4) can move to (6,3) down, (5,4) left, (7,4) right but wall, or (6,5) up but cannot reverse.\n> \n> (5,3) is not directly adjacent; from (6,4), moving to (5,3) would be diagonal, not allowed; must move in U/D/L/R.\n> \n> So to reach (5,3) from (6,4), I need to move to (5,4) or (6,3) first, but (5,3) is one step away only if I move left or down, but (5,3) is at (5,3), which is left and down from (6,4).\n> \n> From (6,4), (5,3) is not orthogonally adjacent; adjacent cells are (6,5) up, (6,3) down, (5,4) left, (7,4) right.\n> \n> (5,3) is down-left, not directly reachable in one move. To eat (5,3), I need to be at (5,3), so I must move to it from an adjacent cell.\n> \n> Currently, head at (6,4), so adjacent cells are (6,3), (5,4), (7,4). (7,4) is wall, so only (6,3) and (5,4) are possible moves.\n> \n> But (5,3) is adjacent to (6,3) and to (5,4), for example.\n> \n> If I move to (5,4) this turn, then next turn I could move down to (5,3) if I want.\n> \n> But (5,3) has life span 1, so must be eaten on this turn, turn 38. If I don't move to it now, it disappears.\n> \n> Can I move to (5,3) directly from (6,4)? No, because it's not orthogonally adjacent; it's diagonal, which is not a direct move.\n> \n> The only way to eat (5,3) on this turn is if I move to it directly, but since it's not adjacent, I can't.\n> \n> (6,4) to (5,3) is not a valid move; valid moves are only up, down, left, right to adjacent cells.\n> \n> So from (6,4), (5,3) is not adjacent; distance is sqrt(2), not 1 in grid steps.\n> \n> Therefore, I cannot move to (5,3) directly from (6,4).

It will disappear after this turn because life span 1.\n> \n> Life span 1 at turn 38: it is present at turn 38, and if not eaten during turn 38, it disappears after turn 38. Since I can't move to it on turn 38, I cannot eat it, so it will be gone.\n> \n> Therefore, (5,3) is not available for eating; I should ignore it.\n> \n> Now, other foods: (2,2), (5,4), (2,6)\n> \n> (5,4) is directly adjacent to head?

No, snake body is at (6,5), (6,6), etc., not (5,4). Food can spawn under body, but in this case, (5,4) is not under body; it's free.\n> \n> So moving to (5,4) would eat the food, increase length by 1.\n> \n> But I need to think about future moves and risks.\n> \n> First, let's list possible actions for turn 38.\n> \n> Head at (6,4), direction D, so can move:\n> \n> - D: to (6,3)\n> \n> - L: to (5,4)\n> \n> - R: to (7,4) but wall, invalid.\n> \n> So only D or L.\n> \n> If I move L to (5,4), I eat the food at (5,4), snake grows to 8 segments, head now at (5,4), and since I moved left, new direction L.\n> \n> Then body will follow: new tail position depends on movement.\n> \n> If I move D to (6,3), no food, head at (6,3), direction D.\n> \n> Now, I need to think ahead 5+ turns.\n> \n> Also, there is a danger about tail reward: if head adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it causes collision.\n> \n> But here, tail is at (3,5), head is at (6,4), not adjacent.

(5,4) and (4,4) is wall, but (5,4) is free.\n> \n> (5,4) has food.\n> \n> (2,2) food, (2,6) food.\n> \n> Now, life span: (5,4) has 6 turns, (2,2) has 3 turns, (2,6) has 9 turns.\n> \n> I need to survive and eat food.\n> \n> Also, the snake is in a bit of a corner; head at (6,4), with walls around.\n> \n> For example, moving left to (5,4) eats food, but then head at (5,4), which has walls nearby.\n> \n> From (5,4), possible moves: U to (5,5), but (5,5) is wall, internal obstacle.\n> \n> D to (5,3), but (5,3) has food but it will disappear after this turn, so on next turn, if I'm at (5,4), (5,3) might be gone or not, but since life span 1 at turn 38, after turn 38 it disappears, so on turn 39, (5,3) is gone.\n> \n> L to (4,4), but (4,4) is wall.\n> \n> R to (6,4), but that's where the body is, but (6,4) is previous head, which will move? When snake moves, the body follows, so after moving head to (5,4), the body will move to (6,4) from (6,5)? Let's think.\n> \n> After moving to (5,4), the new positions: head at (5,4), then the first body segment moves to previous head (6,4), but since we ate food, a new segment is added at the tail, so the tail doesn't move.\n> \n> When you eat food, length increases, so the head moves to new cell, and a new segment is added where the tail was, so tail stays, body shifts.\n> \n> Standard snake: when move without eating, head to new cell, tail removed. When eat, head to new cell, tail stays, new segment added.\n> \n> So in this case, if I move to (5,4) and eat food, new head at (5,4), body: previous head (6,4) becomes segment 1, then (6,5) segment 2, (6,6) segment 3, (5,6) segment 4, (4,6) segment 5, (3,6) segment 6, and tail (3,5) stays, so tail is still (3,5), and a new segment is added at tail? No.\n> \n> Positions: before move: head (6,4), body (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), tail (3,5).\n> \n> After moving head to (5,4) and eating: new head (5,4), then the body segments shift: the segment that was at (6,4) is now the first body segment at (6,4)? No.\n> \n> When head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment in front.\n> \n> So: new head at (5,4). Then, the first body segment (previously at (6,5)) moves to the old head position (6,4)? Let's index.\n> \n> Positions list: index 0: head, 1: next, etc., to tail.\n> \n> After move without eating: new head at new position, position 0 new, position 1 = old position 0, position 2 = old position 1, ..., position k = old position k-1, tail old position k-1 is removed.\n> \n> With eating: new head at new position, position 1 = old position 0, position 2 = old position 1, ..., position k = old position k-1, and new tail position = old tail position, since tail doesn't move, and a new segment is added at the end.\n> \n> So for length L, positions: after eat, new head, then old head, then old body up to old tail, which remains tail? No.\n> \n> Example: snake of length 2: head A, tail B.\n> \n> Move to new cell C and eat: new head C, then old head A becomes body, and tail B remains, so positions: C (head), A (body), B (tail), length 3.\n> \n> If not eat, move to C, head C, tail moves to A, B removed, positions C, A.\n> \n> Similarly here.\n> \n> Current snake: positions [ (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5) ] head to tail.\n> \n> After moving to (5,4) and eating: new head at (5,4), then body: old head (6,4) becomes first body segment, so positions: head (5,4), body (6,4), then (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), and tail (3,5) remains, and since ate, new segment added at tail, so tail is now (3,5) still, but a new segment is added where? The new segment is added at the previous tail position, so the tail doesn't move, but a new segment is attached.\n> \n> So positions: head (5,4), then body segments: (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), and tail (3,5), but since ate, we add a new segment at the tail, so the old tail (3,5) becomes the new last body segment, and the new tail is still at (3,5)? No.\n> \n> When adding a segment, the tail position stays the same, and it becomes the new tail, but the segment is added, so the list grows.\n> \n> After move and eat: the head moves to new position, the body segments each move to the position of the previous segment, so the first body segment moves to old head position, second to old first body, etc., and the tail position remains, but since we add a segment, the old tail position is now occupied by the new last body segment, and the tail itself is still at the same cell, but it's not moving, so the cell is unchanged.\n> \n> In terms of positions: new head at new cell. Then, for the body, the segment that was at index i moves to the position of index i-1 from previous state. But since we ate, we don't remove the tail, so the tail cell stays.\n> \n> So previous positions: P0 = head (6,4), P1 = (6,5), P2 = (6,6), P3 = (5,6), P4 = (4,6), P5 = (3,6), P6 = tail (3,5)\n> \n> After moving to (5,4) and eating: new positions: new head at (5,4).

It's turn 39. The grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so cells from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are at the borders, so playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6)? Let me confirm.\n> \n> Walls: Border cells x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. That means if x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7, it's a wall. So the grid is 8x8, but the actual playable cells are from (1,1) to (6,6), since (0,y) and (7,y) for all y, and (x,0), (x,7) for all x are walls. Also internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1). So these are blocked cells.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (5,4), then (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5). So the snake has 8 segments. Head direction is L, meaning it was moving left to reach (5,4) from previous position. Since head is at (5,4) and direction is L, it came from the right, so previous head was at (6,4), but (6,4) is the second segment now. Snake positions list: head first, so (5,4) is head, then body: (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5). So the tail is at (3,5).\n> \n> Head direction L means it just moved left to (5,4), so from (6,4) to (5,4). Since it moved left, the current direction is left, so for the next move, I can't move right instantly because of no instant reverse. So possible moves are U, D, L, but not R.\n> \n> Food:\n> \n> - (2,2) with value 1, life span 3. So it disappears after 3 turns, including current turn? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 39, life span 3 means it will disappear after turn 41? Let's see: at turn t, life span N, it disappears after N turns, meaning after turn t + N - 1 or something. Need to clarify.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span).

Let's think.\n> \n> \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" – so at the start of turn t, if life span is N, after the turn, it decreases to N-1. When it reaches 0, it disappears, so it is present until the end of turn when life span becomes 0.\n> \n> Standard way: at turn t, with life span N, it will be present for N more turns, including turn t. So it disappears after turn t + N - 1? Let's define.\n> \n> Suppose at turn t, food has life span L.\n> \n> After turn t is completed, life span becomes L-1.\n> \n> If L-1 > 0, it remains; if L-1 = 0, it disappears after this turn.\n> \n> \"Disappears after N turns\" – I think \"after N turns\" means after N full turns have passed.\n> \n> Perhaps it's better to think: if at turn t, life span is N, then it will disappear at the end of turn t + N - 1? Let's see an example.\n> \n> Assume at turn t, life span N.\n> \n> - During turn t, it is present.\n> \n> - After turn t, countdown decreases to N-1.\n> \n> - If N-1 > 0, it remains for turn t+1.\n> \n> - When countdown reaches 0, it disappears after that turn.\n> \n> So for food at (2,2): turn 39, life span 3, so:\n> \n> - Turn 39: life span 3, present\n> \n> - Turn 40: life span 2, present\n> \n> - Turn 41: life span 1, present\n> \n> - After turn 41, life span 0, disappears, so not present on turn 42.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (2,6): life span 8, turn 39, so it will be present until turn 46 (since 39+8-1=46? Turn 39: L=8, after turn L=7; turn 40: L=7, ..., turn 46: L=1, present; after turn 46, L=0, disappear. Turn 39 to 46 is 8 turns? From turn 39 to turn 46 inclusive is 8 turns: 39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46. That's 8 turns, but life span decreases each turn, so at turn 39 L=3, turn 40 L=2, turn 41 L=1, turn 42 not present. For (2,2), L=3 at turn 39, so present on turn 39,40,41; disappears before turn 42.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,6) L=8 at turn 39, present on turns 39 to 46 inclusive (8 turns: 39 to 46 is 46-39+1=8 turns), disappears before turn 47.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan actions for multiple turns ahead, at least 5 turns, to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n> \n> Current turn is t1=39.\n> \n> I need to output an action sequence starting from turn 39.\n> \n> Possible actions: U, D, L, R, but since head direction is L, I cannot move right (opposite) on this turn. So for turn 39, possible moves: U (up, to (5,5)? y+1 is up? Let's define coordinates.\n> \n> Typically in grids, (0,0) bottom left or top left? The problem says \"U(x,y+1)\", so assuming y increases upwards, x increases right. So U: (x,y+1), D: (x,y-1), L: (x-1,y), R: (x+1,y).\n> \n> Walls: border x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So playable area: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1)\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (5,4), body: (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5)\n> \n> So let's plot this to visualize.\n> \n> Grid rows y from 1 to 6, columns x from 1 to 6.\n> \n> y=6: top, y=1: bottom.\n> \n> x=1 left, x=6 right.\n> \n> Obstacles:\n> \n> - (5,2): x=5,y=2\n> \n> - (4,4)\n> \n> - (1,2)\n> \n> - (1,5)\n> \n> - (1,4)\n> \n> - (3,4)\n> \n> - (5,5)\n> \n> - (6,1)\n> \n> Snake:\n> \n> Head: (5,4)\n> \n> Then (6,4) -- to the right\n> \n> Then (6,5) -- up\n> \n> Then (6,6) -- up\n> \n> Then (5,6) -- left\n> \n> Then (4,6) -- left\n> \n> Then (3,6) -- left\n> \n> Then (3,5) -- down? (3,6) to (3,5) is down.\n> \n> So the snake is like: head at (5,4), body goes to (6,4), then up to (6,5), up to (6,6), left to (5,6), left to (4,6), left to (3,6), down to (3,5). So tail at (3,5).\n> \n> Now, current direction L, so just moved left from (6,4) to (5,4). So cannot move right immediately.\n> \n> Possible moves from (5,4):\n> \n> - U: (5,5) but (5,5) is an obstacle? Internal obstacles include (5,5), yes, (5,5) is listed, so cannot move there.\n> \n> Obstacles: (5,5) is an internal obstacle, so blocked.\n> \n> - D: (5,3) -- is this free? Let's see what's at (5,3).\n> \n> First, walls: not border, so possible.\n> \n> Obstacles: obstacles are (5,2), (4,4), etc., (5,2) is at y=2, but (5,3) is not listed, so should be free.\n> \n> Snake positions: snake is at (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5). So (5,3) is not occupied by snake or obstacle, so free? But (5,2) is obstacle, but (5,3) should be free.\n> \n> - L: (4,4) -- (4,4) is an internal obstacle! (4,4) is listed, so blocked.\n> \n> - R: (6,4) -- but (6,4) is occupied by the snake's body, second segment. But when we move, the snake moves, so after move, the tail moves, so we can move to a cell that was tail, but only if it becomes free.\n> \n> Collision rules: body collision if head touches any body segment except the tail, because when head moves to a cell, if that cell is occupied by body, it collides, but if it is the tail, and tail moves away, it might be ok? Let's see.\n> \n> \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, if head moves to a cell that is currently occupied by the tail, it is safe because the tail moves away at the same time, so no collision.\n> \n> But if it moves to a cell occupied by any other body segment, it collides and dies.\n> \n> Also, walls: cannot move to wall cells.\n> \n> Now, from (5,4), possible moves:\n> \n> - U: (5,5) -- but (5,5) is an internal obstacle, so wall, cannot move there. Blocked.\n> \n> - D: (5,3) -- is this free? Let's check: not a wall border, not internal obstacle (obstacles are (5,2), not (5,3)), not occupied by snake body except possibly tail. Snake positions: (5,4) head, (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5). So (5,3) is not in the list, so free. But (5,2) is obstacle below, but (5,3) is clear. So can move down to (5,3).\n> \n> - L: (4,4) -- (4,4) is internal obstacle, so blocked, cannot move there.\n> \n> - R: (6,4) -- (6,4) is occupied by the snake's second segment. Is this a body collision? The cell (6,4) has a body segment that is not the tail. Tail is at (3,5). So (6,4) is the second segment, which is not tail. If head moves to (6,4), it would collide with the body at (6,4), since that segment doesn't move away immediately; only the tail moves when the head moves. When head moves to a new cell, all body segments shift, so the segment at (6,4) would move to where the head was, (5,4), but the head is moving to (6,4), so at the new state, (6,4) would be the new head position, but the old body at (6,4) is moving to (5,4), so the cell (6,4) is vacated by the body and occupied by head simultaneously? No.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, that cell becomes new head, then each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead. So when head moves from (5,4) to (6,4), the cell (6,4) was occupied by the second segment, which then moves to (5,4), which was the old head position. But at the moment of movement, when head moves to (6,4), if (6,4) was occupied by a body segment, it might cause collision. But according to the rule: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment\", implying that for non-tail segments, it is a collision.\n> \n> Specifically: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, moving to a cell occupied by a non-tail body segment causes collision.\n> \n> Here, (6,4) is occupied by the second segment, not tail, so moving right to (6,4) would cause collision.\n> \n> Therefore, from (5,4), possible moves:\n> \n> - U: blocked by obstacle (5,5)\n> \n> - D: (5,3) free, can move\n> \n> - L: blocked by obstacle (4,4)\n> \n> - R: blocked by body at (6,4) (non-tail)\n> \n> So only possible move is down to (5,3). Is that right?\n> \n> U: (5,5) obstacle, blocked.\n> \n> D: (5,3) — let's confirm if it's free. x=5,y=3.\n> \n> Not border wall.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (5,2) is at y=2, (5,3) is y=3, not listed, so no obstacle.\n> \n> Snake: positions are (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (3,5). (5,3) not there.\n> \n> Also, no food there, I think, but food is at (2,2) and (2,6), not (5,3).\n> \n> So (5,3) is empty and free.\n> \n> L: (4,4) is obstacle, blocked.\n> \n> R: (6,4) has body segment, non-tail, so collision if move there.\n> \n> Therefore, only possible action is D, down to (5,3).\n> \n> But I need to think multiple turns ahead. Also, there might be risks or opportunities.\n> \n> First, for turn 39, I must move down, as it's the only choice to avoid immediate death.\n> \n> But let's double-check.\n> \n> Is there any other possibility? What about moving into the tail? Tail is at (3,5), which is not adjacent to head.

Subsequent moves prioritize reaching the positive food at (2,6) by turn 45, as it has a long life span and is achievable via a safe leftward then upward path, while avoiding the deadly dead end that would result from moving right on turn 40.

It's turn 40, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid goes from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are at the borders, so I can only move within x=1 to x=6 and y=1 to y=6? Let me confirm.\n> \n> The border cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, meaning those are walls, so the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6). x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, since x=0 and x=7 are walls, similarly y=0 and y=7.\n> \n> Also, there are internal obstacles: [(5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1)]. So these cells are blocked and I can't move there.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (5,3), then body segments: (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6). So the tail is at (3,6).\n> \n> Head direction is D, which is down. So last move was down, meaning from (5,4) to (5,3)? Positions are head first: [(5,3), (5,4), ...], so head is at (5,3), and the next segment is (5,4). Since head direction is D, down, that means the snake was moving down to (5,3), so from (5,4) to (5,3) down.\n> \n> Now, possible moves: I can move U (up), D (down), L (left), R (right), but with constraints. No instant reverse, so since head direction is D (down), I cannot move U (up) on the next turn. So possible actions now: D, L, R. But I have to check for collisions.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (2,2) with life span 2, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (2,6) with life span 7, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (2,4) with life span 10, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> All food are positive, value 1, so no negative food here. Life spans: (2,2) has life 2, meaning it disappears after 2 turns, including current turn? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 40, life span 2 means it will be there for this turn and next, disappearing at turn 42? Let's read carefully.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So, for a food with life span L at turn T, it will disappear after L turns, so it exists from turn T to turn T + L - 1? Let's think.\n> \n> Countdown decreases every turn, including current. So at turn T, if life span is L, after turn T, countdown becomes L-1, and so on, until countdown 0, then it disappears. So it exists as long as countdown > 0.\n> \n> At the turn it is spawned, life span is N, so after that turn, it decreases to N-1.\n> \n> In the state, at turn 40, food is given with life span.\n> \n> For (2,2): life span 2, so at turn 40, countdown=2.

But that might be messy.\n> \n> The rule says: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> I think it's simpler: at the start of turn t, if food has life_span S, it can be eaten during that turn. At the end of the turn, life_span decreases by 1. When life_span reaches 0, it disappears before the next turn.\n> \n> But for planning, we care about how many turns it will be available.\n> \n> For food at turn 42 with life span 6: it will be available for eating on turns 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, and 47.

It says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" and \"Action Sequence\" in order for turns t1, t1+1, etc. But it might be for as long as I can reasonably plan.\n> \n> Probably, I should plan for at least 5 turns.\n> \n> First, let's see the grid around.\n> \n> Let me sketch a small grid.\n> \n> Columns x: 0 to 7\n> \n> Rows y: 0 to 7, but usually y increases up, but in the positions, snake is at (3,3), (4,3), etc., and food at (2,6), (2,4), so y=6 is high, probably y=0 bottom, y=7 top?

Let me confirm the wall cells.\n> \n> Walls: border cells x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Also internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1).

(2,5) new head, then (2,4) is now first body, then (2,3), (3,3), etc., up to (6,5), and (6,6) removed.

        "thinking": "Let's analyze the current state and possible moves step-by-step to determine the best immediate action at Turn 45.\n\n### Current State (Turn 45):\n- **Snake Positions**: [(2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5)]  \n  (Head at (2,5), tail at (6,5), length = 9)\n- **Head Direction**: U (up)\n- **Food**:\n  - (2,6): value +1, life span 3 (disappears after Turn 47)\n  - (3,5): value +1, life span 8 (disappears after Turn 52)\n- **Walls/Obstacles**: Border walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Internal obstacles at [(5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1)].\n\n### Possible Moves from (2,5):\nCurrent direction is U (up), so we cannot move D (down) due to the \"no instant reverse\" rule. Possible moves:\n1. **U (up) to (2,6)**:\n   - (2,6) has food (+1). \n   - Check safety: \n     - Not a wall or obstacle.\n     - Not occupied by the snake's body (only the tail is at (6,5)).\n     - Not adjacent to the tail's food (tail is at (6,5), no food there).\n   - Outcome: Eat food, grow to length 10.\n2. **L (left) to (1,5)**:\n   - (1,5) is an internal obstacle (wall). Invalid move (deadly collision).\n3. **R (right) to (3,5)**:\n   - (3,5) has food (+1).\n   - Check safety:\n     - Not a wall or obstacle.\n     - Not occupied by the snake's body.\n     - Not adjacent to the tail's food.\n   - Outcome: Eat food, grow to length 10.\n\n### Decision:\nBoth U and R are valid moves that allow eating positive food. We must choose the move that maximizes long-term survival and score. \n\n#### Option 1: Move U to (2,6)\n- Eat (2,6) (life span 3, expires soon).\n- Next turn (Turn 46), from (2,6):\n  - Cannot move L (to (1,6)): Leads to a dead end (all moves from (1,6) are invalid).\n  - Must move R to (3,6).\n- From (3,6), can eat (3,5) at Turn 47, but this leads to being trapped at (3,5) with no valid moves afterward (death at Turn 48).\n\n#### Option 2: Move R to (3,5)\n- Eat (3,5) (life span 8, expires later).\n- Next turn (Turn 46), from (3,5):\n  - Can move U to (3,6) or R to (4,5).\n  - Moving U to (3,6) allows eating (2,6) at Turn 47 (before it expires), but this again leads to being trapped at (2,6) (death at Turn 48).\n  - Moving R to (4,5) avoids eating (2,6), but this means missing the expiring food (lower score).\n\n### Conclusion:\nBoth options eventually lead to being trapped after eating both foods. However, eating (2,6) first (Option 1) ensures we don't miss the expiring food, and the sequence allows us to eat both foods before death. This maximizes the score (total +2) compared to eating only one food (+1).\n\n### Final Action:\n\\boxed{U}",
        "state": "**Current Turn**: \\( t_0 = 45 \\)\n**Cells occupied by walls**:\n\t - Border Cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7.\n\t - Internal Obstacles: [(5, 2), (4, 4), (1, 2), (1, 5), (1, 4), (3, 4), (5, 5), (6, 1)]\n**Snake Positions**:[(2, 5), (2, 4), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 3), (5, 3), (5, 4), (6, 4), (6, 5)]\n**Snake Head Direction**: U\n**Food Positions, Life Span and Value**:\n\t- (2, 6, 3, 1)\n\t- (3, 5, 8, 1)\n> **Guidance from a Previous Thinking Model:** Turn \\( t_1 = 45 \\)\n> <think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 45, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the playable area is from x=1 to x=6 and y=1 to y=6? Let me confirm.\n> \n> The walls are border cells: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. That means the grid is from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7, but x=0 and x=7 are walls, similarly y=0 and y=7. So the snake can only be in cells where 1 <= x <= 6 and 1 <= y <= 6? Not necessarily, because internal obstacles might block, but the borders are walls, so moving to x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7 is a wall collision.\n> \n> Also, internal obstacles: [(5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1)]. So these cells are also blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (2,5), then (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5). So the snake is 9 segments long. Head direction is U, which is up, so moving in the positive y-direction.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (2,6) with value 1 and life span 3. So it will disappear after 3 turns, including this one? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 45, life span 3 means it will be there for turns 45, 46, 47, and disappear after turn 47? Let me clarify the life-span rule.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So for food at (2,6) with life span 3 at turn 45: it will be present on turn 45, 46, 47, and disappear before turn 48? Countdown decreases every turn, so at turn 45, countdown is 3, after turn 45, it becomes 2, then after turn 46, it becomes 1, after turn 47, it becomes 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten on turns 45, 46, or 47.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (3,5) with value 1 and life span 8, so it will last until turn 52 (45 + 8 - 1? Let's see: at turn 45, life span 8, so after 8 turns, it disappears. After turn 45, life span 7; turn 46, 6; ... turn 52, 0, disappears before turn 53. So present from turn 45 to 52.\n> \n> Both foods have value +1, so positive food.\n> \n> I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks.

So:\n> \n> - (1,2), (1,4), (1,5) in column x=1\n> \n> - (3,4) at (3,4)\n> \n> - (4,4) at (4,4)\n> \n> - (5,2), (5,5)\n> \n> - (6,1)\n> \n> Snake: head at (2,5), moving up (U). Positions: [(2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5)]\n> \n> So the snake is mostly vertical from (2,3) to (2,5), then right to (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), then up to (5,4), then right to (6,4), then up to (6,5). Head at (2,5) U.\n> \n> Food at (2,6) and (3,5).\n> \n> (2,6) is directly above the head at (2,5).

But for current action, I can choose U, L, R, but not D because of no instant reverse. Directions: U, D, L, R. Current head direction is U, so I cannot move D on this turn because that would be opposite direction.\n> \n> The rule: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\"\n> \n> \"on next turn\" – let's read carefully.\n> \n> \"Movement Constraints: In each turn you can choose to move 1 cell in following directions: U, D, L, R. No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\"\n> \n> The phrasing is a bit ambiguous. \"Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\" – I think it means that when you choose an action for the current turn, you cannot choose the opposite of the current direction.\n> \n> For example, current direction is U, so for turn t, I cannot choose D; I can choose U, L, or R.\n> \n> Similarly, after moving, the new direction becomes the move I made.\n> \n> So at turn 45, head direction U, so I can move U, L, or R, but not D.\n> \n> Possible moves from (2,5):\n> \n> - U: to (2,6)\n> \n> - L: to (1,5)\n> \n> - R: to (3,5)\n> \n> Now, check what these cells are.\n> \n> First, (2,6): is it a wall? Walls are at y=0 and y=7, so y=6 is not wall, x=2 is between 1 and 6. But is it an obstacle? Internal obstacles: (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), (3,4), (4,4), (5,2), (5,5), (6,1). (2,6) not in list, so free? But it has food! Food at (2,6) with value 1.\n> \n> (2,6) has food, and it's not a wall or obstacle, so moving U to (2,6) is possible, and I would eat the food.\n> \n> But I need to check if it's safe. Eating food increases length, so the tail grows.\n> \n> Also, collision: if I move to (2,6), is there a body part? Snake positions: [(2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5)]. (2,6) is not in the list, so no body collision. Also, not a wall. So moving U to (2,6) seems safe for this turn.\n> \n> But I need to think ahead.\n> \n> Similarly, moving L to (1,5): (1,5) is an internal obstacle? Internal obstacles include (1,5), yes, (1,5) is in the list, so it's a wall, cannot move there. Obstacle means it's like a wall, I think.\n> \n> \"Cells occupied by walls\" include internal obstacles, so (1,5) is a wall cell, so moving to (1,5) would be a wall collision, deadly. So cannot move L.\n> \n> Moving R to (3,5): (3,5) has food? Food at (3,5), yes, value 1. Is (3,5) a wall? x=3, y=5, not in wall list. Walls: borders x=0,7 y=0,7, and internal (1,2),(1,4),(1,5),(3,4),(4,4),(5,2),(5,5),(6,1). (3,5) not listed, so free. And no body part? Snake positions: (2,5), (2,4), etc., no (3,5), so moving to (3,5) is also possible, eating the food there.\n> \n> So from current position, I can move U to (2,6) or R to (3,5), both have food, or I could move to a safe cell without food, but both available moves have food except L is blocked.\n> \n> L is blocked, so only U and R are possible, both with food.\n> \n> But I need to think about the consequences.\n> \n> First, if I move U to (2,6): I eat the food at (2,6). Since it's positive food, snake length increases by 1. So after eating, the snake will have a new segment. When I move to (2,6), the head moves there, and since I eat food, the tail doesn't move, so the new position: head at (2,6), and the body: the previous head (2,5) becomes body, then (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), and since I ate, the tail stays, so tail is still (6,5), length 10 now? Original positions: 9 segments. After move without eating, tail moves forward, but with eating, tail doesn't move.\n> \n> Sequence: when snake moves, head moves to new cell. If new cell has food, eat it, and snake grows, so tail doesn't move; else, tail moves to next segment, so length same.\n> \n> Here, moving to (2,6) has food, so eat, head at (2,6), body: (2,5) added, then (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5) remains as tail. So positions: [(2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5)]? (6,5) is the tail, and since tail didn't move, it stays, but in the list, (6,5) was the last, and it remains.\n> \n> Original snake: index 0: head (2,5), 1: (2,4), 2: (2,3), 3: (3,3), 4: (4,3), 5: (5,3), 6: (5,4), 7: (6,4), 8: tail (6,5).\n> \n> After moving U to (2,6) and eating: new head at (2,6), then segment 1 becomes (2,5), segment 2 becomes (2,4), ..., up to segment 8 becomes (6,4), and since ate, new segment added, so segment 9 is (6,5), which was the old tail, but since tail didn't move, it stays, so the new tail is still (6,5), but now it's part of the body? Let's think.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, and eats food, the tail does not advance, so the new position has the head at new cell, and all body segments remain, with the tail staying put. So the snake gains one segment.\n> \n> So new positions: head (2,6), then the previous head (2,5) is now the first body, then (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), and tail (6,5) remains. So now 10 segments: [(2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5)].\n> \n> Similarly, if I move R to (3,5), eat food there, new head at (3,5), then (2,5) becomes body, then (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5) remains, so positions: [(3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5)].\n> \n> Now, for both cases, I need to think about future moves.\n> \n> First, let's consider moving U to (2,6).\n> \n> After turn 45: head at (2,6), direction U (since I moved U).\n> \n> Now, at turn 46, I need to choose next action.\n> \n> Possible moves from (2,6): U, D, L, R.\n> \n> But current direction U, so cannot move D.\n> \n> U to (2,7): but y=7 is wall, since border y=7 is wall. So cannot move U, collision.\n> \n> L to (1,6): x=1, y=6. Is (1,6) a wall? Internal obstacles: (1,2),(1,4),(1,5), but not (1,6). Border walls: x=0 and x=7 are walls, but x=1 is not border wall? x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x=1 is not wall, unless internal obstacle.\n> \n> Internal obstacles listed: (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), so (1,6) is not in list, so it should be free.\n> \n> But is it? Walls: border cells x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So cells like (0,y) for all y, (7,y) for all y, (x,0) for all x, (x,7) for all x are walls.\n> \n> Additionally, internal obstacles: the points listed, which are also walls.\n> \n> So (1,6): x=1 not 0 or 7, y=6 not 0 or 7, and not in internal obstacles list: (1,2), (1,4), (1,5) are obstacles, (1,6) not listed, so (1,6) should be free.\n> \n> Similarly, R to (3,6): (3,6) not wall, not obstacle.\n> \n> D to (2,5): but (2,5) is now a body segment! After moving to (2,6), positions: head (2,6), body (2,5), (2,4), etc. So (2,5) is occupied by the snake body, so moving to (2,5) would be body collision.\n> \n> Similarly, for other directions.\n> \n> From (2,6), possible moves:\n> \n> - U: (2,7) is y=7, wall, invalid.\n> \n> - D: to (2,5), which is body segment, collision, invalid.\n> \n> - L: to (1,6), which should be free, as above.\n> \n> - R: to (3,6), which should be free.\n> \n> Now, (1,6): is it accessible?

Let me confirm.\n> \n> The walls are border cells: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. That means the grid is from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7, but x=0 and x=7 are walls, similarly y=0 and y=7. So the snake can only be in cells where 1 <= x <= 6 and 1 <= y <= 6? Not necessarily, because internal obstacles might block, but the borders are walls, so moving to x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7 is a wall collision.\n> \n> Also, internal obstacles: [(5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1)].

Walls are at y=0 and y=7, so y=6 is not wall, x=2 is between 1 and 6. But is it an obstacle? Internal obstacles: (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), (3,4), (4,4), (5,2), (5,5), (6,1). (2,6) not in list, so free? But it has food! Food at (2,6) with value 1.\n> \n> (2,6) has food, and it's not a wall or obstacle, so moving U to (2,6) is possible, and I would eat the food.\n> \n> But I need to check if it's safe. Eating food increases length, so the tail grows.\n> \n> Also, collision: if I move to (2,6), is there a body part? Snake positions: [(2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5)]. (2,6) is not in the list, so no body collision. Also, not a wall. So moving U to (2,6) seems safe for this turn.\n> \n> But I need to think ahead.\n> \n> Similarly, moving L to (1,5): (1,5) is an internal obstacle? Internal obstacles include (1,5), yes, (1,5) is in the list, so it's a wall, cannot move there. Obstacle means it's like a wall, I think.\n> \n> \"Cells occupied by walls\" include internal obstacles, so (1,5) is a wall cell, so moving to (1,5) would be a wall collision, deadly. So cannot move L.\n> \n> Moving R to (3,5): (3,5) has food? Food at (3,5), yes, value 1. Is (3,5) a wall? x=3, y=5, not in wall list. Walls: borders x=0,7 y=0,7, and internal (1,2),(1,4),(1,5),(3,4),(4,4),(5,2),(5,5),(6,1). (3,5) not listed, so free. And no body part? Snake positions: (2,5), (2,4), etc., no (3,5), so moving to (3,5) is also possible, eating the food there.\n> \n> So from current position, I can move U to (2,6) or R to (3,5), both have food, or I could move to a safe cell without food, but both available moves have food except L is blocked.\n> \n> L is blocked, so only U and R are possible, both with food.\n> \n> But I need to think about the consequences.\n> \n> First, if I move U to (2,6): I eat the food at (2,6). Since it's positive food, snake length increases by 1. So after eating, the snake will have a new segment. When I move to (2,6), the head moves there, and since I eat food, the tail doesn't move, so the new position: head at (2,6), and the body: the previous head (2,5) becomes body, then (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), and since I ate, the tail stays, so tail is still (6,5), length 10 now? Original positions: 9 segments. After move without eating, tail moves forward, but with eating, tail doesn't move.\n> \n> Sequence: when snake moves, head moves to new cell. If new cell has food, eat it, and snake grows, so tail doesn't move; else, tail moves to next segment, so length same.\n> \n> Here, moving to (2,6) has food, so eat, head at (2,6), body: (2,5) added, then (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5) remains as tail. So positions: [(2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5)]? (6,5) is the tail, and since tail didn't move, it stays, but in the list, (6,5) was the last, and it remains.\n> \n> Original snake: index 0: head (2,5), 1: (2,4), 2: (2,3), 3: (3,3), 4: (4,3), 5: (5,3), 6: (5,4), 7: (6,4), 8: tail (6,5).\n> \n> After moving U to (2,6) and eating: new head at (2,6), then segment 1 becomes (2,5), segment 2 becomes (2,4), ..., up to segment 8 becomes (6,4), and since ate, new segment added, so segment 9 is (6,5), which was the old tail, but since tail didn't move, it stays, so the new tail is still (6,5), but now it's part of the body? Let's think.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, and eats food, the tail does not advance, so the new position has the head at new cell, and all body segments remain, with the tail staying put. So the snake gains one segment.\n> \n> So new positions: head (2,6), then the previous head (2,5) is now the first body, then (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), and tail (6,5) remains. So now 10 segments: [(2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5)].\n> \n> Similarly, if I move R to (3,5), eat food there, new head at (3,5), then (2,5) becomes body, then (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5) remains, so positions: [(3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5)].\n> \n> Now, for both cases, I need to think about future moves.\n> \n> First, let's consider moving U to (2,6).\n> \n> After turn 45: head at (2,6), direction U (since I moved U).\n> \n> Now, at turn 46, I need to choose next action.\n> \n> Possible moves from (2,6): U, D, L, R.\n> \n> But current direction U, so cannot move D.\n> \n> U to (2,7): but y=7 is wall, since border y=7 is wall. So cannot move U, collision.\n> \n> L to (1,6): x=1, y=6. Is (1,6) a wall? Internal obstacles: (1,2),(1,4),(1,5), but not (1,6). Border walls: x=0 and x=7 are walls, but x=1 is not border wall? x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x=1 is not wall, unless internal obstacle.\n> \n> Internal obstacles listed: (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), so (1,6) is not in list, so it should be free.\n> \n> But is it? Walls: border cells x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So cells like (0,y) for all y, (7,y) for all y, (x,0) for all x, (x,7) for all x are walls.\n> \n> Additionally, internal obstacles: the points listed, which are also walls.\n> \n> So (1,6): x=1 not 0 or 7, y=6 not 0 or 7, and not in internal obstacles list: (1,2), (1,4), (1,5) are obstacles, (1,6) not listed, so (1,6) should be free.\n> \n> Similarly, R to (3,6): (3,6) not wall, not obstacle.\n> \n> D to (2,5): but (2,5) is now a body segment! After moving to (2,6), positions: head (2,6), body (2,5), (2,4), etc. So (2,5) is occupied by the snake body, so moving to (2,5) would be body collision.\n> \n> Similarly, for other directions.\n> \n> From (2,6), possible moves:\n> \n> - U: (2,7) is y=7, wall, invalid.\n> \n> - D: to (2,5), which is body segment, collision, invalid.\n> \n> - L: to (1,6), which should be free, as above.\n> \n> - R: to (3,6), which should be free.\n> \n> Now, (1,6): is it accessible? No obstacles, yes.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,6) free.\n> \n> But I need to see if there are foods or dangers.\n> \n> Foods: only two foods, (2,6) was eaten, so removed, and (3,5) still there with life span 7 after this turn? Turn 45: food (2,6) life span 3, eaten, so gone. Food (3,5) life span 8, at turn 45, after turn 45, life span 7 for turn 46.\n> \n> At turn 46, only food is (3,5) with life span 7.\n> \n> But (3,5) is at (3,5), which is below (2,6)? (2,6) to (3,5) is not adjacent directly; (3,5) is down-right from (2,6)? (2,6) to (3,5) is not a direct move; moves are U/D/L/R.\n> \n> From (2,6), moving to (3,5) directly is not possible; only adjacent cells.\n> \n> (3,5) is at x=3,y=5, while (2,6) is x=2,y=6, so not adjacent; (2,6) adjacent cells: (2,7), (2,5), (1,6), (3,6). (3,5) is not adjacent to (2,6); it's diagonal.\n> \n> So at (2,6), no food adjacent.\n> \n> So from (2,6), I can move L to (1,6) or R to (3,6).\n> \n> Now, let's think about moving to (1,6) or (3,6).\n> \n> First, if I move L to (1,6): head to (1,6), no food there, so no eat, snake moves, tail moves forward.\n> \n> After move: head to (1,6), direction L. Then the body: previous head (2,6) becomes body, then (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), and tail (6,5) moves to (6,4)? When no eat, tail moves.\n> \n> Original after eat: positions at turn 45 end: [(2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5)]\n> \n> After moving to (1,6) without eating: head to (1,6), then the body: (2,6) becomes segment 1, (2,5) segment 2, ..., up to (6,4) becomes segment 8?

No: after head moves to new cell, the first body segment is the previous head position, so new: head (1,6), body: (2,6), then (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), and (6,4) becomes the tail, but (6,4) was segment 8, and segment 9 (6,5) is removed since tail moved.\n> \n> So positions: [(1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4)] with tail at (5,4)? Let's count segments.\n> \n> Previous: 10 segments.\n> \n> After move without eat: head moves to new cell, and all segments shift, tail cell is vacated.

It's turn 47. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and internal obstacles at (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1). So, I should sketch a grid to visualize this.\n> \n> The grid is from (0,0) to (7,7), I assume, since borders are mentioned.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (3,6), then body: (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4). So the snake is 10 segments long. Head direction is R (right), meaning it's moving east.\n> \n> Food: two items:\n> \n> - (3,5) with life span 6, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (6,4) with life span 9, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> (6,4) is also the tail position of the snake, since snake positions end with (6,4). But food is at (6,4), and the tail is there. According to the rules, food can spawn under the body, but can only be eaten when the body moves away and head moves onto it. But here, (6,4) is the tail, so if the snake moves such that the tail moves away, then head can eat it, but we have to be careful because of Tail Reward Danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills the snake because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> In this case, food is at tail (6,4), and head is at (3,6). Are they adjacent? Let's see positions: head (3,6), tail (6,4). Distance: |3-6| = 3 in x, |6-4| = 2 in y, so not adjacent; they are 3 cells apart in x and 2 in y, so not adjacent. So no immediate danger from that.\n> \n> But when can the snake eat this food? The tail will move when the snake moves, so if the snake moves in a way that the tail leaves (6,4), then later head can come to (6,4) to eat the food.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (3,5) has life span 6, meaning it disappears after 6 turns, including current turn? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 47, life span 6, so it will disappear after turn 52? Let's clarify.\n> \n> Life span N: disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current. So at turn t, if life span is L, it will be gone after turn t + L - 1? For example, if L=1, it disappears after this turn, so if not eaten now, it's gone.\n> \n> Standard: if life span is L at turn t, it has L turns left, including current. So after L turns, it disappears. So for food at (3,5), life span 6 at turn 47, so it will disappear after turn 52 (since 47 to 48 is one turn down, 48 to 49 second, ..., 52 to 53 would be the sixth, but after turn 52, it's gone? Let's think carefully.\n> \n> At turn 47, life span 6. After turn 47 is completed, life span decreases to 5 at turn 48. After turn 48, to 4, and so on. So it disappears when life span reaches 0. After turn 47, if not eaten, life span becomes 5 at start of turn 48. After turn 52, life span becomes 0, so it disappears before turn 53. So last chance to eat is on turn 52.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (6,4) life span 9 at turn 47, so it disappears after turn 55 (47 + 8 = 55? Let's calculate: from turn 47 to 48: down to 8, turn 48 to 49:7, ..., after turn 55: at start of turn 56, life span 0, gone. So can be eaten from turn 47 to 55 inclusive? At turn t, with life span L, it can be eaten during turn t if head moves there, and life span decreases after the turn if not eaten? I think we need to clarify the timing.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) | Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> And \"Food can be eaten if head moves onto the food cell during the turn.\"\n> \n> I think when the snake moves to a cell with food, it eats it at that turn.\n> \n> Countdown: at the beginning of turn t, for each food, if life span is L, and it's not eaten during t, then at end of turn, L decreases by 1. If L was 1, it disappears after the turn.\n> \n> For food at (3,5): life span 6 at turn 47. So during turn 47, if eaten, fine. If not, after turn 47, life span becomes 5. Similarly, it can be eaten on turn 47,48,49,50,51,52. On turn 52, if life span is 1, and eaten, ok; if not, after turn 52, it disappears.\n> \n> Similarly for (6,4): life span 9, can be eaten from turn 47 to 55.\n> \n> Now, current head position (3,6), direction R (right). Possible moves: since head direction is R, I can move U, D, R, but not L (left) because that would be instant reverse? No instant reverse: cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\n> \n> Current direction is R, so next move cannot be L (left). Can move U (up), D (down), or R (right).\n> \n> Now, let's see the grid. I should make a map.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.

No, when you eat, the tail doesn't move immediately; the snake grows, so after moving, the head is at new position, and a new segment is added at the end, but since it grows, the tail doesn't move that turn.\n> \n> Movement: each turn, head moves to a new cell, if that cell has food, it eats, and the snake grows, so tail stays in place (no movement of tail that turn). If no food, tail moves forward, so last segment is removed.\n> \n> Standard snake mechanics.\n> \n> In this case, if I move to (3,5) and eat, then new head position (3,5), and the body segments remain, but since it grows, we add a new segment at the end, so tail is still (6,4), but now snake has 11 segments.\n> \n> Positions: original body from (2,6) to (6,4), head was (3,6), move down to (3,5), so new head (3,5), and since eaten, we add a new segment at the tail, so tail becomes the new end, which is... let's see the body.\n> \n> Current snake: positions list: [ (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4) ]\n> \n> After move: head moves to (3,5), so new head (3,5). Since eaten, no tail movement, so body remains, and we add a new segment at the position where tail was, so the snake becomes: [ (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4) ] and since we add a segment, tail is now (6,4) but it's the same cell? No, the last segment was (6,4), we add a new segment at (6,4), so now tail is still (6,4), but it's the same cell? In terms of positions, the new tail is at (6,4), but since we added a segment, the position (6,4) is now occupied by the new tail segment.\n> \n> But the food at (6,4) is still there, under the tail.\n> \n> If no eat, tail moves: head moves to new cell, last segment removed.\n> \n> But here with eat, no tail move, tail position stays, but we add a segment, so the tail cell has the tail segment.\n> \n> Now, direction: after moving down, new head direction is D (down).\n> \n> Now, the other option is to move R to (4,6), no eat, so head moves to (4,6), tail (6,4) is removed, so new positions: [ (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4) ] and tail is (5,4).

Positions given as (x,y), so let's say x from left to right, y from bottom to top? But in coordinates, (0,0) bottom left or top left? Usually in such games, (0,0) top left, y increasing down, or bottom left y up. But here, walls y=0 and y=7, so probably y=0 is bottom or top? Not specified, but since walls are borders, it doesn't matter for adjacency, but for visualization.\n> \n> In the snake positions, head (3,6), and moving down to (3,5) would decrease y, so probably y=0 is bottom or top? If head at (3,6) and down to (3,5), y decreases, so likely y increases up or down.\n> \n> In standard coordinates, often y=0 top, y increases down, so down means increasing y. But here, from (3,6) to (3,5), if down is D, to (3,5), y decreased, so y=0 is top? Let's see the walls.\n> \n> Walls at y=0 and y=7, so if y=0 is top, y=7 bottom, then from (3,6) down to (3,7) would be invalid wall, but D is to (3,5), y=5, which is between 0 and 7.\n> \n> Similarly, U to (3,7) y=7 wall.\n> \n> So probably y=0 is top row, y=7 bottom row, so decreasing y is up? I'm confused.\n> \n> Define: let's say cell (x,y), with x from 0 to 7 (left to right), y from 0 to 7 (top to bottom). So moving up (U) decreases y, down (D) increases y, left (L) decreases x, right (R) increases x.\n> \n> For example, from (3,6), U to (3,5), D to (3,7), L to (2,6), R to (4,6).\n> \n> In this case, D to (3,7) is y=7, which is bottom wall, invalid.\n> \n> U to (3,5) is valid.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (3,5) is above head? Head at (3,6), (3,5) is y=5, which is one above if y=6 is lower than y=5? If y=0 top, y=7 bottom, then y=5 is above y=6.\n> \n> So from (3,6) to (3,5) is moving up, but the action is D? I think I have a confusion in direction naming.\n> \n> In the problem, U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), L (x-1,y), R (x+1,y).\n> \n> U: (x, y+1) — so y+1, which if y=0 top, y+1 down, so U is down? Let's read.\n> \n> \"U`(x,y+1)`\" so if y increases downward, U is down. Similarly, D is (x,y-1), y decreases, so up.\n> \n> In standard, often U is up, but here the definition is U: (x,y+1), so y+1 means increasing y, which if y=0 top, y+1 is down, so U is downward movement.\n> \n> But in the head direction, it says \"Snake Head Direction: R\", which is right.\n> \n> And movement: U, D, L, R.\n> \n> To avoid confusion, let's use the coordinate changes.\n> \n> U: delta x=0, delta y=+1\n> \n> D: delta x=0, delta y=-1\n> \n> L: delta x=-1, delta y=0\n> \n> R: delta x=+1, delta y=0\n> \n> And since walls at y=0 and y=7, with internal obstacles, we can think of the grid with (0,0) as top-left or bottom-left, but for adjacency, it doesn't matter.\n> \n> For this state, from (3,6), with direction R (last move was R, so current direction R).\n> \n> Possible moves:\n> \n> - U: to (3,6+1) = (3,7) — y=7, border wall, invalid\n> \n> - D: to (3,6-1) = (3,5) — y=5, within bounds, not wall, not occupied by body (body at (2,6),(2,5),etc, (3,5) not in list), so valid, and has food.\n> \n> - L: to (3-1,6) = (2,6) — occupied by body segment (second position), so collision, invalid.\n> \n> - R: to (3+1,6) = (4,6) — x=4,y=6, not border (x=0,7 walls, x=4 ok), not internal obstacle (obstacles at (5,2),(4,4),etc, (4,6) not listed), not occupied by snake, so valid, no food.\n> \n> So only two choices: D to (3,5) or R to (4,6).\n> \n> If I go D to (3,5), I eat the food, grow to 11 segments, new head at (3,5), direction D.\n> \n> Then the snake is at: [(3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4)] tail at (6,4).\n> \n> Food at (6,4) is still there, under tail.\n> \n> If I go R to (4,6), no eat, head to (4,6), tail removed, so snake: [(4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4)] tail at (5,4).\n> \n> Food at (3,5) is still there, life span now 5 at turn 48 if not eaten now.\n> \n> Now, I need to think ahead 5 turns.\n> \n> Also, the food at (6,4) is under tail, so to eat it, we need the tail to move away and head to come later.\n> \n> But if we eat at (3,5) now, the tail stays at (6,4), so food still under tail.\n> \n> If we don't eat, tail moves, so at (6,4) is now free, but food is there, so head can eat it immediately if possible, but head is at (3,6) or after move.\n> \n> After move R to (4,6), tail moved from (6,4), so (6,4) is now free with food, but head is at (4,6), not adjacent to (6,4), so not immediately eatable.\n> \n> Distance: from (4,6) to (6,4) is |4-6|=2 in x, |6-4|=2 in y, so not adjacent.\n> \n> Now, let's plan for multiple turns.\n> \n> First, consider the option of eating now at (3,5).\n> \n> Turn 47: move D to (3,5), eat food, grow to 11 segments.

Up to (4,7) wall, left to (3,6) body, so only Down or Right.\n> \n> Now, I need to think about food and survival.\n> \n> Food at (3,5) and (6,4).\n> \n> (3,5) is close to the snake. Current head (4,6), (3,5) is left and down? From (4,6), (3,5) is one left and one down, but since we can only move one step, not directly adjacent diagonally.\n> \n> Adjacent cells: (4,5) down, (5,6) right, (3,6) left but invalid, (4,7) up invalid.\n> \n> (3,5) is not adjacent to head; it's at (3,5), head at (4,6), so distance: Δx=1, Δy=1, not adjacent, so we need multiple moves to reach.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,4) is at (6,4), head at (4,6), so we need to move right and down.\n> \n> Now, life span: (3,5) has life span 5, meaning it will disappear after 5 more turns? At current turn 48, life span 5, so after this turn (turn 48), it will have 4 left, then 3,2,1, and on turn 53 it disappears. So it can be eaten on turns 48 to 52 inclusive.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,4) life span 8, available turns 48 to 55.\n> \n> But turn 48 is current, so we can eat on turn 48 if head moves to food.\n> \n> But head is at (4,6), food at (3,5) and (6,4), neither adjacent, so cannot eat immediately.\n> \n> Now, let's plan the path.\n> \n> First, I need to avoid collisions and plan for multiple turns.\n> \n> Also, the tail: tail is at (5,4), and there might be food under tail or something, but here no food listed under snake, I think.\n> \n> Food at (3,5) and (6,4), not under snake.\n> \n> Now, \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> But here, tail is at (5,4), head at (4,6), not adjacent; adjacent would be same x or y differing by 1.\n> \n> (4,6) and (5,4): Δx=1, Δy=2, not adjacent. So no issue now.\n> \n> Now, to maximize score, I should eat the food, but with life span, (3,5) might expire soon, so I should go for it first? But it has only 5 turns left, and I need to reach it.\n> \n> Distance to (3,5): from (4,6) to (3,5), I can go down to (4,5), then left to (3,5), but (3,5) might be available.\n> \n> (4,5) is free, as I thought.\n> \n> Then from (4,5), I can move left to (3,5), but (3,5) is the food position.\n> \n> Is (3,5) occupied? No, not by snake or obstacle.\n> \n> But when I move to (3,5), I eat the food, snake grows, so new head at (3,5), and tail doesn't move, so length increases.\n> \n> But before that, from (4,6), if I move down to (4,5), turn 48.\n> \n> Then on turn 49, head at (4,5), I can move left to (3,5) to eat food.\n> \n> But is (3,5) reachable? Let's see the body.\n> \n> When I move to (4,5) on turn 48, the snake moves: head to (4,5), then the body follows: previous head (4,6) becomes new neck, so positions: head (4,5), then (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), and tail (5,4) moves to (5,3)? Let's trace.\n> \n> On turn 48, before move: positions: [(4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4)] head at (4,6)\n> \n> I move down to (4,5). So new head at (4,5).

Let's list positions.\n> \n> Old positions: index 0: (4,6) head, 1: (3,6), 2: (2,6), 3: (2,5), 4: (2,4), 5: (2,3), 6: (3,3), 7: (4,3), 8: (5,3), 9: (5,4) tail\n> \n> After move down to (4,5):\n> \n> New head: (4,5)\n> \n> Then new body:\n> \n> - Segment 1 (was at (3,6)) moves to old head position (4,6)\n> \n> - Segment 2 (was at (2,6)) moves to old segment 1 position (3,6)\n> \n> - Segment 3 (was at (2,5)) moves to old segment 2 position (2,6)\n> \n> - Segment 4 (was at (2,4)) moves to old segment 3 position (2,5)\n> \n> - Segment 5 (was at (2,3)) moves to old segment 4 position (2,4)\n> \n> - Segment 6 (was at (3,3)) moves to old segment 5 position (2,3)\n> \n> - Segment 7 (was at (4,3)) moves to old segment 6 position (3,3)\n> \n> - Segment 8 (was at (5,3)) moves to old segment 7 position (4,3)\n> \n> - Segment 9 (was at (5,4)) moves to old segment 8 position (5,3)\n> \n> New tail is at (5,3), since segment 9 moved to (5,3).\n> \n> But segment 8 was at (5,3), moved to (4,3), and segment 9 was at (5,4) moved to (5,3).\n> \n> Now positions: head (4,5), then (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3) — 10 segments, tail at (5,3).\n> \n> Now on turn 49, from (4,5), I can move left to (3,5).\n> \n> (3,5) is food, so I move to (3,5) and eat it.\n> \n> Then new head at (3,5), and snake grows, so tail doesn't move, new segment added.\n> \n> After eating: head at (3,5), then the previous head (4,5) becomes body, so positions: head (3,5), then (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3) and since ate food, tail stays, so 11 segments? Let's see.\n> \n> Before move, positions: [(4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3)]\n> \n> Move head to (3,5), which is food, so after move: head at (3,5), then the first body segment moves to where head was, (4,5), and so on, but since ate food, the tail doesn't move, so a new segment is added at the tail position? No.\n> \n> Standard snake growth: when you eat, the head moves to food, and a new segment is added at the previous tail position, so length increases.\n> \n> So positions: new head at (3,5), then the body segments: the segment that was head now is neck at (4,5), then (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), and new tail at (5,3)? No.\n> \n> The tail segment stays, so the new tail is the old tail position.\n> \n> After move to (3,5):\n> \n> - Head: (3,5)\n> \n> - Neck: previous head at (4,5)\n> \n> - Then previous segment 1 at (4,6)\n> \n> - Previous segment 2 at (3,6)\n> \n> - Previous segment 3 at (2,6)\n> \n> - Previous segment 4 at (2,5)\n> \n> - Previous segment 5 at (2,4)\n> \n> - Previous segment 6 at (2,3)\n> \n> - Previous segment 7 at (3,3)\n> \n> - Previous segment 8 at (4,3)\n> \n> - Previous segment 9 at (5,3) — this was the tail, but since we ate, it remains, and a new segment is added? No.\n> \n> When head moves to food, the tail does not advance, so the last segment stays, and a new segment is created at the old tail position, so the tail position is the same as before, but now it's part of the body, and a new tail is added? I'm confusing myself.\n> \n> Standard: when snake eats, the head moves to the food cell, the body follows as usual, but the tail does not move, so the snake gains one segment. So the new positions are: head at new position, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, but the last segment (tail) does not move, so it stays, and since the segment before it moves to its position, it effectively adds a new segment at the tail.\n> \n> In terms of positions: suppose before move, positions P0 (head), P1, P2, ..., Pk (tail)\n> \n> Head moves to new cell, say N.\n> \n> Then after move: head at N, P0 moves to N? No.\n> \n> After head moves to N, the new body segments are: the segment that was P0 is now at N, but P0 was head, now it's the first body segment at the position where head was? Let's not use indices.\n> \n> Before move: head at H, body segments at B1, B2, ..., Bm, tail at T.\n> \n> After moving head to new cell N:\n> \n> - If N is not food: new head at N, new body: H, B1, B2, ..., Bm except the tail T is left, so positions: N, H, B1, B2, ..., B_{m-1}, and Bm is removed? No.\n> \n> When head moves to N, the new head is N, the first body segment is the old head position H, the second body segment is the old first body position B1, and so on, up to the old tail position, but the old tail position is vacated.\n> \n> Since tail moves, the cell T is free now.\n> \n> But if N is food, then after moving to N, the head is at N, the first body segment is at H, second at B1, ..., the last body segment is at B_{m-1}, and the tail stays at T, but since we add a segment, the new tail is at T, and Bm is now part of body? I think I have it.\n> \n> Typically: positions list: [H, B1, B2, ..., Bk] where Bk is tail.\n> \n> Head moves to N.\n> \n> If not food: new positions [N, H, B1, B2, ..., B_{k-1}] so tail is B_{k-1}, Bk is removed.\n> \n> If food: new positions [N, H, B1, B2, ..., Bk] so tail is Bk, and length increased.\n> \n> In this case, before move on turn 49: positions [ (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3) ] head (4,5), tail (5,3)\n> \n> Move head to (3,5), which is food.\n> \n> So after move: head at (3,5), then the old head (4,5) is first body, then (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), and since ate, tail stays at (5,3), so new positions: [(3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3)] with 11 segments, tail at (5,3).\n> \n> (5,3) is the tail.\n> \n> Back to the plan.\n> \n> If I go down on turn 48 to (4,5), then on turn 49 left to (3,5) to eat the food at (3,5).\n> \n> Food at (3,5) has life span 5 at turn 48, so on turn 49, it should still be there, since life span decreases after each turn, including when we are about to move? Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So at turn 48, life span is 5, meaning after turn 48, it will have 4 left, so it exists during turn 48 and 49? Let's see.\n> \n> The food is present as long as life span > 0, I think. Countdown decreases every turn, including current, so at the start of turn t, if life span L, it is present, and after the turn, L decreases by 1.\n> \n> So for (3,5) at turn 48, life span 5, so it is present. After turn 48, life span becomes 4, still present for turn 49, and so on, until after turn 52, it becomes 0 and disappears for turn 53.\n> \n> Similarly, at turn 49, life span 4, present.\n> \n> So moving to (3,5) on turn 49 is fine, we can eat it.\n> \n> Then we get +1 score.\n> \n> Now, after that, we have another food at (6,4) with life span 8, so plenty of time.\n> \n> But we need to think long-term survival.\n> \n> After eating at (3,5), head at (3,5), and we have to move from there.\n> \n> But let's first decide the sequence.\n> \n> Another option: from (4,6), I could go right to (5,6) on turn 48.\n> \n> Then from (5,6), I can go down to (5,5), but (5,5) is an obstacle?

But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> Here, (4,6) is not the tail; tail is at (5,3).

Not border, y=5 not 0 or 7. Internal obstacles: (6,1) is obstacle, but (6,5) not listed, so should be free. Also, not occupied by snake? Current snake after move: head moved to (6,6), so positions: new head (6,6), then (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3). Tail was (5,3), but since we moved, the tail moves off, so snake now: head (6,6), body: (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), and tail (4,3)?

Positions after turn 50 move:\n> \n> After turn 49: head (6,6), body (5,6) to (4,3)\n> \n> After turn 50 move down to (6,5): new head (6,5), then old head (6,6) becomes first body, then (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), and tail (4,3) is removed? Old tail was (4,3), which is now position 9, but when head moves, tail is removed, so the new snake: positions 0: (6,5) head, 1: (6,6) body, 2: (5,6), 3: (4,6), 4: (3,6), 5: (2,6), 6: (2,5), 7: (2,4), 8: (2,3), 9: (3,3).

No.\n> \n> When food is eaten, the head moves to the food cell, and a new segment is added at the tail, so the tail doesn't move, and the body grows.\n> \n> Standard snake: when you eat, head moves to food, tail stays, so length increases by one.\n> \n> In this case, after move to (6,4), head is at (6,4), the previous head (6,5) is now body, and so on, up to the tail (3,3), which remains, so the new tail is still (3,3), but since we add a segment, the positions should include one more.\n> \n> Positions before move: head (6,5), body (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), tail (3,3)\n> \n> After moving head to (6,4) and eating food: new head at (6,4), then the body: (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3) — and since food eaten, we add a new segment at the tail, so the tail position (3,3) is duplicated, or rather, the tail doesn't advance, so the segment that was tail remains, and we add the new head position.\n> \n> So new positions: [ (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3) ] length 11.\n> \n> Tail is (3,3).\n> \n> Now, for turn 52, head at (6,4), direction D (since last move was down).\n> \n> Possible moves: U, D, L, R, but no instant reverse, so cannot move U (up).\n> \n> Current direction D, so cannot move U.\n> \n> Now, surroundings of (6,4):\n> \n> - U: (6,5) - but (6,5) is the first body segment now, so moving up would collide, invalid\n> \n> - D: (6,3) - not wall? y=3 not border.

So it cannot move left immediately? No: \"Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\" – this is for the next action. Since current direction is R, for the next move (turn t1), it cannot move left, because that would be instant reverse.\n> \n> Let me read: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\"\n> \n> So on turn t1, since current head direction is R, I cannot choose to move left for the action on turn t1. But I can choose up or down.\n> \n> Available moves from (6,6):\n> \n> - Up: (6,7) but y=7 is wall, so invalid.\n> \n> - Down: (6,5) – is this valid? y=5, x=6.\n> \n> - Left: (5,6) – but (5,6) is occupied by the snake body? Snake body has (5,6), which is the first body segment.\n> \n> Collision: if head moves to a body segment, it dies, except if it's the tail and the tail moves away.\n> \n> Rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So moving to (5,6): (5,6) is not the tail; tail is at (4,3). Positions: head (6,6), body: (5,6), (4,6), etc. So (5,6) is the immediate next segment, so if head moves left to (5,6), it would collide with body, since (5,6) is occupied and not the tail.\n> \n> Only if moving to the tail cell, and tail moves away, it's ok.\n> \n> Here, (5,6) is not tail; tail is (4,3), so moving to (5,6) would cause collision.\n> \n> Similarly, moving up to (6,7) is wall, invalid.\n> \n> Moving down to (6,5): what is at (6,5)? Not occupied by snake or obstacle? Let's see.\n> \n> Snake positions: (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3). So (6,5) is not in this list.\n> \n> Obstacles: internal obstacles include (6,1), but not (6,5). Borders: (6,5) has x=6, y=5, which is not border wall since borders are x=0,7 y=0,7. x=6 is within 1 to 6? x=1 to 6 are playable, x=6 is ok, y=5 ok.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (6,1) is obstacle, but (6,5) is not listed, so it should be free.\n> \n> Similarly, down to (6,5) seems possible.\n> \n> But moving left to (5,6) is occupied by body, so invalid.\n> \n> Right to (7,6) is wall, invalid.\n> \n> Up to (6,7) is wall, invalid.\n> \n> So only possible move from (6,6) is down to (6,5).\n> \n> Is that right? Head at (6,6), can only move down to (6,5)? But let's confirm the direction constraint.\n> \n> Current head direction is R, but since it can't move right, and can't move left (opposite, instant reverse not allowed), so only up or down, but up is wall, so only down is possible.\n> \n> But is down allowed? (6,5) is free? Snake positions: no (6,5). Obstacles: no (6,5). Walls: not border since x=6, y=5, x=6 is not x=0 or x=7, similarly y=5 not y=0 or 7. Borders are x=0 and x=7, so x=1 to x=6 are ok. y=0 and y=7, so y=1 to y=6 ok. So (6,5) should be free.\n> \n> But there is food at (6,4), but (6,5) is different.\n> \n> So for turn t1=50, only possible action is Down to (6,5).\n> \n> But let's make sure about the direction: since it was moving right to (6,6), and now at (6,6), moving down, which is perpendicular, not opposite, so should be fine.\n> \n> And no instant reverse issue since not moving left.\n> \n> So action for turn 50 must be D.\n> \n> But I need to plan multiple turns.\n> \n> After moving to (6,5), what next?\n> \n> Let's simulate.\n> \n> Turn 50: move D to (6,5). New head position (6,5).\n> \n> Snake moves, so tail moves as well? When snake moves without eating, tail moves away.\n> \n> If it doesn't eat, the tail segment is removed.\n> \n> In this case, moving to (6,5), which is not food, so snake moves to (6,5), then the body follows: new head (6,5), then previous head (6,6) becomes body, so positions: head (6,5), body: (6,6), then (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), and tail (4,3) is removed? Let's see the sequence.\n> \n> Original positions: [ (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3) ]\n> \n> After moving head down to (6,5): new head at (6,5), then the body segments follow: the first body segment was (5,6), but now head moved to (6,5), so the new body is the previous head (6,6) at position 1, then (5,6) at position 2, (4,6) at 3, and so on, up to (3,3) at position 9, and the tail (4,3) is removed since no growth.\n> \n> So new snake positions: [ (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3) ] and (4,3) is gone. Length is still 10.\n> \n> Now, head at (6,5), and direction is now down, since it moved down.\n> \n> Food: (3,5) life_span 3, so at turn 50, life_span 3, meaning it will disappear after 3 more turns, including current? \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> At turn t1=50, food at (3,5) has life_span 3, so it exists on turn 50,51,52, and disappears after turn 52? Or at the end of turn 52?\n> \n> Typically, life_span decreases each turn, so at turn 50, life_span 3; after turn 50, it decreases to 2, exists; after turn 51 to 1, exists; after turn 52 to 0, disappears. So can be eaten on turn 50,51,52.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,4) life_span 6, at turn 50, so exists for 6 turns: 50 to 55, disappears after 55 or at end of 55? After turn, life_span decreases.\n> \n> Assume: at the start of turn, life_span is given, and after each turn, it decreases by 1. When life_span reaches 0, it disappears before the next turn.\n> \n> So for (3,5): life_span 3 at turn 50, so can be eaten on turn 50,51,52. After turn 52, if not eaten, gone.\n> \n> (6,4): life_span 6, can be eaten turn 50 to 55.\n> \n> (4,6): life_span 9, turn 50 to 58.\n> \n> But (4,6) is currently under snake body, so can only be eaten if body moves away.\n> \n> Now back to turn 50: we must move D to (6,5).\n> \n> After that, head at (6,5), direction D.\n> \n> Now turn 51: possible moves from (6,5).\n> \n> Current direction D, so cannot move up (instant reverse).\n> \n> Possible: down, left, right.\n> \n> - Down: (6,4) – what is there?

After move, snake positions: head (6,5), body (6,6), etc. So (6,6) is occupied by body.\n> \n> If move up to (6,6), it would be body collision, since (6,6) is not tail; tail is now (3,3)? Positions: [ (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3) ] so tail is (3,3).\n> \n> (6,6) is position 1, body segment.\n> \n> So moving to (6,6) would collide with body.\n> \n> Down to (6,4): is it free?

Distance: from (6,4) to (3,5), need to move left 3 times and up once, but since we can only move one step per turn, and we are at (6,4) on turn 52, we can move to adjacent cell, so to reach (3,5) it takes min 3 moves left and 1 up, so 4 moves, but on turn 52 we can only move to one adjacent, so we can't reach (3,5) this turn.

        "state": "**Current Turn**: \\( t_0 = 51 \\)\n**Cells occupied by walls**:\n\t - Border Cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7.\n\t - Internal Obstacles: [(5, 2), (4, 4), (1, 2), (1, 5), (1, 4), (3, 4), (5, 5), (6, 1)]\n**Snake Positions**:[(6, 5), (6, 6), (5, 6), (4, 6), (3, 6), (2, 6), (2, 5), (2, 4), (2, 3), (3, 3)]\n**Snake Head Direction**: D\n**Food Positions, Life Span and Value**:\n\t- (3, 5, 2, 1)\n\t- (6, 4, 5, 1)\n\t- (4, 6, 8, 1)\n> **Guidance from a Previous Thinking Model:** Turn \\( t_1 = 51 \\)\n> <think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 51. The grid has walls: border cells at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7). Internal obstacles are at (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1). I should plot this to visualize.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (6,5), then (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3). So the snake is 10 segments long. Head direction is down, which is decreasing y, since y=5 to y=6 would be down? Let me clarify coordinates.\n> \n> Typically in grids, (0,0) is bottom-left or top-left? The movement: U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), L is (x-1,y), R is (x+1,y). So y increases up? That might be unusual. Let's see: U is (x,y+1), so moving up increases y. So (0,0) is bottom-left, I assume, with y increasing upwards. But walls at y=0 and y=7, so y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top.\n> \n> Snake positions: head (6,5), next is (6,6). Since head is at (6,5) and direction is D (down), which is to (x,y-1). But (6,6) is above (6,5) if y increases up? (6,5) to (6,6) would be moving up if y increases up. But direction is given as D, down. Contradiction?\n> \n> Snake positions: [(6,5), (6,6), ...]. So from head to body: head at (6,5), then (6,6), which is same x, y+1, so that would be up from (6,5) to (6,6)? But direction is D, down. That doesn't make sense.\n> \n> Perhaps the positions are listed with head first, so the snake was at (6,6) previously and moved to (6,5) with direction down? Let's see the sequence.\n> \n> Positions: index 0: head (6,5), index 1: (6,6), which is the segment behind the head. So to get from index 1 to index 0, it moved from (6,6) to (6,5), which is decreasing y, so down direction. Yes, that makes sense. So head at (6,5), and it moved down to there from (6,6). So current direction is D, meaning if it continues down, next position would be (6,4).\n> \n> Now, food:\n> \n> - (3,5) with life span 2, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (6,4) with life span 5, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (4,6) with life span 8, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> (4,6) is also a snake body segment? Snake positions: (4,6) is the third segment, index 2: (5,6), index 3: (4,6). So (4,6) is occupied by the snake body.\n> \n> But food can spawn under snake body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves there. So (4,6) has food, but it's currently under the snake, so we can't eat it immediately.\n> \n> Similarly, other food: (3,5) and (6,4).\n> \n> Life spans: (3,5) has life span 2, meaning it disappears after 2 turns including this one? Countdown decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 51, life span 2, so it will disappear after turn 52? Let's see.\n> \n> Life span N: disappears after N turns. Countdown decreases every turn including current. So at turn t, if life span is L, it will be gone after turn t + L - 1? For example, at turn t, L=1, it disappears after this turn, so can be eaten only if head moves there this turn. If L=2 at turn t, it can be eaten on turn t or t+1, and disappears after turn t+1.\n> \n> Standard: if life span N at turn t, it exists for N turns: from turn t to turn t + N - 1, and disappears at turn t + N.\n> \n> But the countdown decreases every turn, so at turn t, it has N turns left; after turn t, it has N-1, and so on, until 0, then it disappears.\n> \n> But for eating, it can be eaten as long as it exists, so from turn t to turn t + N - 1.\n> \n> In this case, turn 51:\n> \n> - Food at (3,5): life span 2, so can be eaten on turn 51 or 52, disappears after turn 52.\n> \n> - Food at (6,4): life span 5, can be eaten from 51 to 55.\n> \n> - Food at (4,6): life span 8, can be eaten from 51 to 58.\n> \n> But (4,6) is currently occupied by snake body, so it can only be eaten if the snake moves away and head comes later.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan actions for multiple turns ahead, at least 5 turns.\n> \n> Current head position: (6,5), direction D.\n> \n> Possible moves: since direction is D, I can move D (continue down), or L (left), or R (right), but not U (up) because that's opposite, and no instant reverse.\n> \n> So available actions: D, L, R.\n> \n> Now, let's see the grid to avoid walls and body.\n> \n> First, walls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7, inclusive? Walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the playable area is from x=1 to x=6, y=1 to y=6? Let's see.\n> \n> Border cells: x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. So cells like (0,0), (0,1), ..., (7,7) are all walls. Internal obstacles given.\n> \n> So playable cells: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except internal obstacles.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1)\n> \n> List: (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), (3,4), (4,4), (5,2), (5,5), (6,1)\n> \n> Now, snake positions: head (6,5), body: (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3)\n> \n> So tail is at (3,3).\n> \n> Now, food: (3,5), (6,4), (4,6) but (4,6) is occupied.\n> \n> (4,6) is food but under body, so not accessible now.\n> \n> My goal is to maximize score by eating positive food while avoiding risks. All food here is value 1, positive.\n> \n> I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> First, let's see immediate options.\n> \n> From (6,5), I can move:\n> \n> - D: to (6,4) — is this safe? (6,4) has food? Yes, (6,4) is a food position with life span 5. Also, is it a wall? No, walls are at borders and internal, (6,4) is not listed as wall. Internal obstacles include (6,1), but not (6,4). Borders: x=6 is not wall? x=6, y=4: x=6 is not border wall? Border walls are x=0 and x=7, so x=6 is playable, y=4 playable. Similarly, (6,4) not in internal obstacles, so it's free, except food is there.\n> \n> Moving to (6,4): if I move D to (6,4), I eat the food, since head moves there. Food at (6,4) is positive, so I gain +1, length increases by 1.\n> \n> But is it safe? After moving, the snake body: head to (6,4), then the previous head (6,5) becomes body, and so on. Tail is at (3,3), which moves to (2,3) or something? When head moves, the tail moves only if no food eaten; if food eaten, tail doesn't move, so length increases.\n> \n> Collision: moving to (6,4), is there any body segment there? Current body positions: (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3). None at (6,4), so no collision. Walls: no. So moving D to (6,4) seems safe and I eat food.\n> \n> But there's a risk: Tail Reward Danger. If head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills. Here, tail is at (3,3), head at (6,5), not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing edge, so (6,5) to (3,3) is not adjacent; distance is |dx| + |dy| = 3 + 2 = 5, not adjacent. So no issue.\n> \n> Thus, moving D to (6,4) seems good.\n> \n> But I need to think long-term. Also, there is food at (3,5) with short life span, only 2 turns left, so I might want to eat that soon.\n> \n> (3,5) can be eaten on turn 51 or 52.\n> \n> If I move to (6,4) on turn 51, I eat that food, but then (3,5) might disappear if I don't get it by turn 52.\n> \n> From (6,4), where can I go?\n> \n> Also, food at (4,6) under body, which might be available later.\n> \n> Let me sketch the grid.\n> \n> Grid 8x8, but playable area: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? Borders: x=0,7 and y=0,7 are walls, so cells with x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6 are playable, except internal obstacles.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), (3,4), (4,4), (5,2), (5,5), (6,1)\n> \n> So let's list all obstacles:\n> \n> - Walls: all cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7\n> \n> - Internal: (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), (3,4), (4,4), (5,2), (5,5), (6,1)\n> \n> Now snake: head (6,5), body: (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3)\n> \n> Food: (3,5), (6,4), (4,6) but (4,6) occupied.\n> \n> Now, possible moves from (6,5):\n> \n> - D: to (6,4) — free, has food.\n> \n> - L: to (5,5) — is (5,5) free? (5,5) is an internal obstacle? Internal obstacles include (5,5), yes, (5,5) is listed, so wall, cannot move there.\n> \n> - R: to (7,5) — but x=7 is border wall, cannot move.\n> \n> - U: to (6,6) — but (6,6) is the first body segment, so if I move there, head touches body, collision, death. Also, instant reverse not allowed since current direction D, U is opposite, so cannot move U anyway.\n> \n> So only possible moves are D, L, R, but L to (5,5) is wall, R to (7,5) is wall, so only possible move is D to (6,4).\n> \n> Is that right? Available actions: D, L, R, but L is to (5,5), which is obstacle, R to (7,5) border wall, so indeed, only D is possible?\n> \n> But (5,5) is internal obstacle, yes, listed. And (7,5) border.\n> \n> So from (6,5), moving L would be to (5,5), which is wall, not allowed. Similarly R to (7,5) wall. D to (6,4) is possible.\n> \n> U not allowed and would be body.\n> \n> So only one choice: move D to (6,4).\n> \n> Then on turn 51, action D.\n> \n> After moving to (6,4), I eat the food there, so length increases to 11, and the food is consumed.\n> \n> Now, new state: head at (6,4), direction D (since I moved down).\n> \n> Body: the previous head (6,5) becomes new body segment, so positions: head (6,4), then (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3) — but since I ate food, tail doesn't move, so positions: head (6,4), body: (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3) — 11 segments.\n> \n> Tail is still at (3,3) for now.\n> \n> Now, food: (3,5) with life span 2 at turn 51, so after turn 51, life span decreases to 1, so can be eaten on turn 52 only, then disappears.\n> \n> (6,4) was eaten, so removed.\n> \n> (4,6) with life span 8, still there, under body? (4,6) is occupied by body segment. After move, (4,6) is still body, since it was index 3, now with new head, positions: index 0: (6,4), 1: (6,5), 2: (6,6), 3: (5,6), 4: (4,6), etc. So (4,6) is index 4, body, with food under it, but not accessible.\n> \n> Life span of (4,6) food: at turn 51, life span 8, so after turn 51, it will have 7 left, etc.\n> \n> Now turn 52.\n> \n> Head at (6,4), direction D.\n> \n> Possible moves: D, L, R (not U, since opposite to current D).\n> \n> Current direction D, so can move D, L, R.\n> \n> Now, positions:\n> \n> - D: to (6,3) — what is (6,3)? Is it free? y=3, x=6. Borders: no, x=6 not border, y=3 not border. Internal obstacles: (6,1) is obstacle, but (6,3) not listed. Snake body: current positions: (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3). (2,3) and (3,3) are there, but (6,3) not occupied. So (6,3) seems free. Also, no food there.\n> \n> - L: to (5,4) — (5,4) is not wall? Internal obstacles: (5,2), (5,5), not (5,4). So (5,4) should be free.

The segment that was at old position 4 is now at new position 5, but the cell is the same, so (4,6) is still occupied by the same segment.\n> \n> The cell (4,6) is occupied by the segment that was there, and it hasn't moved; only the head and the body segments closer to head have changed.\n> \n> The segment at old index 4 is still at (4,6) after the move, but now it is index 5 in the new list.\n> \n> The cell (4,6) is still occupied.\n> \n> When will it move? When the head moves again, and this segment will move to the position of the previous segment in the chain.\n> \n> For example, on the next move, if head moves to another cell with no food, then new position for this segment will be the position of old position 3 or something.\n> \n> It takes as many moves as the index for the segment to move to a new cell.\n> \n> The segment at index k will move when the head has moved k times.\n> \n> In this case, for index 4, after 4 moves of the head with no food, this segment will have moved to a new position.\n> \n> But that's slow.\n> \n> Since the snake is long, it might take time to free (4,6).\n> \n> But the food at (4,6) has long life span, 8 turns at turn 51, so after turn 51, it has 7 turns left (since countdown decreases every turn).\n> \n> At turn 51, life span 8, so it can be eaten from turn 51 to turn 58.\n> \n> After turn 51, it has 7 turns left, can be eaten from turn 52 to turn 58.\n> \n> Similarly, at turn 52, it has 6 turns left, etc.\n> \n> But since it's under body, it can only be eaten when the cell is free and head moves there.\n> \n> So I need to free that cell first.\n> \n> To free (4,6), I need the body to move away from it.\n> \n> In the current configuration, the segment at (4,6) will move when the head moves and the body shifts.\n> \n> For example, if I move the head several times without eating food, the body will shift, and eventually the segment at (4,6) will move to a different cell.\n> \n> Specifically, after one move with no food, the segment at (4,6) remains, but its index changes.\n> \n> After two moves with no food, it might move.\n> \n> Let's assume I don't eat food for a few turns.\n> \n> After turn 51, head at (6,4), segment at (4,6) is index 4.\n> \n> After one move with no food, say to (6,3), new positions: head (6,3), 1:(6,4), 2:(6,5), 3:(6,6), 4:(5,6), 5:(4,6), ... so (4,6) is now index 5, still there.\n> \n> After second move with no food, say head to (6,2), new positions: head (6,2), 1:(6,3), 2:(6,4), 3:(6,5), 4:(6,6), 5:(5,6), 6:(4,6), so (4,6) index 6, still there.\n> \n> The segment is still at (4,6) because it's far from the head.\n> \n> The segment will only move when the head has moved enough that this segment is close to the tail and the tail moves.\n> \n> The cell (4,6) will be vacated when the segment that is there moves to a different cell, which happens when the tail advances.\n> \n> For example, each time no food is eaten, the tail moves forward, so the body shortens from the tail end.\n> \n> In this case, the segment at (4,6) is fixed until it becomes the tail or something.\n> \n> Let's think of the tail.\n> \n> After turn 51, tail at (3,3).\n> \n> If I move with no food, the tail is removed, so the new tail is the previous position 9: (2,3) or something.\n> \n> After turn 51, position 10: (3,3) tail.\n> \n> After move to (6,3) no food, tail removed, new tail is old position 9: (2,3)\n> \n> Positions: new 0: (6,3), 1: (6,4), 2:

only when it is not the last segment, but as long as it is not the tail, it stays until the head moves and it shifts position.\n> \n> I think I'm confusing myself.\n> \n> The cell (4,6) will be occupied until the segment that is there is no longer part of the snake, which happens when it becomes the tail and then the tail moves away with no food.\n> \n> But it's not efficient.\n> \n> To free (4,6), I need to move the head such that the body segment at (4,6) is forced to move, but it only moves when the segment before it moves, and so on.\n> \n> The fastest way is to have the head move in a way that the body shifts quickly, but since the snake is long, it takes many moves.\n> \n> For example, after 4 moves with no food, the segment that was at (4,6) will have moved to the position that was (6,4) or something, but it's messy.\n> \n> Perhaps for now, since the food at (3,5) is lost, and (6,4) is eaten, I should focus on not trapping myself and then go for (4,6) later.\n> \n> But (4,6)

It's turn 52. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and internal obstacles at (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1). So the playable area is from x=1 to x=6 and y=1 to y=6, minus those obstacles.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (6,4), then (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3). So the snake has 11 segments. Head direction is down, which is decreasing y, since D is (x,y-1). Current head is (6,4), moving down would go to (6,3).\n> \n> Head direction is D, so from (6,4), moving D would go to (6,3). But let's list the positions to understand the shape.\n> \n> Positions: (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3)\n> \n> So the head is at (6,4), tail is at (3,3). The snake is going down from (6,4), but the body is above it at (6,5) and (6,6), so it must have been moving up or something. Let's see the direction: head at (6,4), next segment (6,5), which is above it, so y=5 > y=4, so if head was at (6,5) and moved down to (6,4), that makes sense because head direction is given as D, so it just moved down to (6,4).\n> \n> From the positions: (6,4) is head, then (6,5) is the neck, so it came from (6,5) to (6,4), which is down, so direction D is consistent.\n> \n> Now, food:\n> \n> - (3,5) with value 1, life span 1\n> \n> - (4,6) with value 1, life span 7\n> \n> - (1,1) with value 1, life span 10\n> \n> All food has value +1, so positive food. No negative food mentioned.\n> \n> Life span: (3,5) has life span 1, meaning it disappears after this turn if not eaten? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 52, it has life span 1, so after this turn, it will be gone if not eaten. Similarly, (4,6) has life span 7, so it will last 7 more turns, and (1,1) has life span 10.\n> \n> But (4,6) is currently occupied by the snake! Look: snake positions include (4,6). Food at (4,6) is listed, but the snake is on that cell? That might be possible because food can spawn under the body, but it can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves in.\n> \n> Specifically, for (4,6), it's the 5th segment of the snake: positions are [(6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), ...] so (4,6) is occupied by the snake body.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (3,5) – is that occupied? Snake has (2,5), (2,4), etc., (3,5) not in positions, so free? Let's see all snake positions: (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3)\n> \n> (3,5) is not in the list, so it should be free, but is it a wall or obstacle? Walls: internal obstacles are (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1). (3,5) is not in walls, so it should be empty.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,6) is occupied by snake body, and food is there, but since it's under body, it can't be eaten directly.\n> \n> Food at (1,1) is also free, I assume.\n> \n> Now, head at (6,4), direction D, so possible moves: since direction is D, I can't move U (up) instantly because that would be reverse.

Possible moves: D, L, R.\n> \n> D: (6,3)\n> \n> L: (5,4)\n> \n> R: (7,4) but x=7 is wall, border, so invalid. x=7 is border, so (7,4) is out of bounds.\n> \n> Similarly, U is reverse, not allowed.\n> \n> So possible actions: D to (6,3) or L to (5,4).\n> \n> Now, (6,3): is it safe? Let's check if it's wall or body.\n> \n> Walls: (6,1) is obstacle, but (6,3) is not listed.

Internal obstacles: (5,2), (5,5) listed, but (5,4) not. So should be free. Snake positions: no (5,4), so empty.\n> \n> But I need to think ahead to maximize score and avoid risks.\n> \n> First, immediate turn: turn 52, I need to choose action.\n> \n> Food at (3,5) has life span 1, meaning if not eaten this turn, it disappears. So it might be tempting to go for it, but how?\n> \n> Head at (6,4), (3,5) is at x=3,y=5. That's not adjacent; it's 3 units away in x and 1 in y, so I can't reach it in one move.\n> \n> Possible moves from (6,4): to (6,3) or (5,4).\n> \n> From (6,3), next moves could be to (6,2), (5,3), (7,3) but x=7 wall, so (6,2) or (5,3).\n> \n> Similarly from (5,4), could go U to (5,5), but (5,5) is obstacle? Internal obstacles include (5,5), so (5,5) is wall, cannot go there.\n> \n> D to (5,3), L to (4,4) but (4,4) is obstacle, listed, so cannot, R to (6,4) but that's where head was, occupied by body now? After move, body moves, but at the moment of move, (6,4) will be occupied by the neck when head moves away.\n> \n> Let's think carefully.\n> \n> Also, food at (4,6) is on the body, but it has life span 7, so it might be available later if the snake moves away.\n> \n> But for now, (3,5) is critical because it disappears after this turn.\n> \n> Can I reach (3,5) this turn? No, because it's not adjacent to head. Adjacent cells are (6,3), (5,4), (7,4) invalid, (6,5) but (6,5) is body, and U is reverse, not allowed anyway.\n> \n> So I cannot eat (3,5) this turn. Therefore, it will disappear after this turn regardless. So no point trying for it; it's gone.\n> \n> Life span 1 at turn 52, so if not eaten on turn 52, it disappears. Since I can't eat it this turn, it will be gone.\n> \n> So I should ignore (3,5).\n> \n> Now, other food: (4,6) is on body, so I need to move the body away to eat it later.\n> \n> (4,6) is currently occupied by snake segment, so to eat it, I need the head to be on (4,6) after the body moves away.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,1) is far away, life span 10, so plenty of time.\n> \n> Now, head at (6,4), direction D.\n> \n> Possible actions: D to (6,3) or L to (5,4).\n> \n> I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> First, let's sketch the grid to visualize.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, minus obstacles.\n> \n> Obstacles: (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), (3,4), (4,4), (5,2), (5,5), (6,1)\n> \n> And borders, but we avoid x=0,7 y=0,7 anyway.\n> \n> Snake: head (6,4), body: (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), tail (3,3)\n> \n> So the snake is mostly on the right and top, with a bend.\n> \n> From head (6,4) down, but since direction D, moving to (6,3) would go towards the bottom.\n> \n> (5,4) is left.\n> \n> Now, if I go D to (6,3), what happens?\n> \n> (6,3) should be safe. Then next turn, from (6,3), direction is D, so I can move D to (6,2), L to (5,3), or R invalid, U reverse not allowed.\n> \n> (6,2): is it wall? (6,1) is obstacle, but (6,2) not listed, so should be free. No body there yet.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,3): not obstacle, not body.\n> \n> But (6,1) is obstacle below, so (6,2) is above (6,1), should be ok.\n> \n> If I go to (6,3), then I can consider going down or left.\n> \n> But there might be risks.\n> \n> Another option: go L to (5,4) now.\n> \n> (5,4): not obstacle, not body.\n> \n> From (5,4), direction was from (6,4) to (5,4), so moving left, so new direction L.\n> \n> Then possible moves: U to (5,5), but (5,5) is obstacle, cannot.\n> \n> D to (5,3), or L to (4,4), but (4,4) is obstacle, cannot.\n> \n> R to (6,4), which is now body, but after move, (6,4) is occupied by the neck, and since the snake moves, when head moves to (5,4), the tail moves away from (3,3), so (6,4) is now the second segment, so moving back to (6,4) might be possible if it's not the neck or something? No, collision: if head moves to a cell occupied by body, it dies, except if it's the tail and tail moves away.\n> \n> Specifically, when moving, the head moves first, then the body follows. So if head moves to a cell that will be free after tail moves, but only if it's the tail cell.\n> \n> General rule: head can move to the current tail position because when the snake moves, the tail leaves that cell before head arrives, so no collision.\n> \n> But for other body parts, collision occurs.\n> \n> In this case, if I go to (5,4) from (6,4), then next move, from (5,4), if I go R back to (6,4), but (6,4) is currently the neck, which is now the second segment after head moves to (5,4).\n> \n> After moving to (5,4), the snake positions become: head (5,4), then (6,4) (was head), then (6,5), etc., and tail (3,3) moves? When head moves to (5,4), the segment that was at (3,3) is removed if no food eaten, so positions: new head (5,4), then (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3) — tail is (2,3), since (3,3) is gone?

It's turn 53. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and internal obstacles at (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1).\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (6,3), then body segments: (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3). So the snake is 11 segments long. Head direction is Down (D), meaning it's moving downwards. Since it's at (6,3) and direction is D, last move was down to (6,3) from (6,4)? Positions are listed head first: [(6,3), (6,4), ...], so head is at (6,3), and the next segment is (6,4), which is above it since y increases upwards? I need to confirm the coordinate system.\n> \n> Typically in such games, (0,0) might be bottom-left or top-left. But here, walls are given with y=0 and y=7 as borders. Snake positions: head at (6,3), then (6,4), (6,5), (6,6). Since y=6 is high, and it goes to (5,6), etc., probably y=0 is bottom and y=7 is top, so moving up increases y.\n> \n> Head direction is D, which is down, so (x,y-1). So from (6,3), moving down would go to (6,2), but (6,2) might be a wall or something? Walls: borders y=0 and y=7, so y=2 should be fine unless there's an obstacle.\n> \n> Internal obstacles include (6,1), which is a point, so (6,2) should be free.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (4,6) with value 1 and life span 7? The format is (x,y, value, life_span), so (4,6,7,1) – that might be (x,y, life_span, value)? Let's read: \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value: - (4, 6, 7, 1)\" and \"- (1, 1, 9, 1)\". It says \"Value and Life Span\" but in the input it's listed as (x,y, something, something).

I think it's a tuple: (x,y, life_span, value) or what?\n> \n> Let's see the value: it says value1, life_span1, so for (4,6,7,1), it could be x=4,y=6, life_span=7, value=1? And (1,1,9,1) x=1,y=1, life_span=9, value=1? Both have value=1, but value should be +1 for positive food or -1 for negative, but here both are 1, so both positive? But it says \"Positive Food\" and \"Negative Food\", so value should indicate sign.\n> \n> In this case, both have value=1, so both are positive food? But let's confirm the notation.\n> \n> In the state: \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value: - (4, 6, 7, 1) - (1, 1, 9, 1)\" and since it says \"Value and Life Span\", I think (x,y, life_span, value) or (x,y, value, life_span)? But value is +1 or -1, life_span is number.\n> \n> For (4,6,7,1), if it's (x,y, life_span, value), then life_span=7, value=1. Similarly, (1,1,9,1) life_span=9, value=1. Both value=1, so positive food.\n> \n> But value=1 means positive, -1 would be negative.

When the snake moves without eating, the tail is removed, so the segment that was at index 5 ( (4,6) ) will be at index 5 for a while, but as the snake moves, it shifts.\n> \n> The position (4,6) will be vacated when the segment that was there moves away, which depends on the movement.\n> \n> Since the snake moves one step at a time, the cell (4,6) will be free only after the segment that is currently on it moves to another cell.\n> \n> Currently, at turn 53, segment at (4,6) is index 5.\n> \n> After one move, if no eat, tail is removed, head moves, so index 5 is still at (4,6) because the segments shift: the head moves, segment 1 moves to where head was, segment 2 to where segment 1 was, ..., segment 5 still at (4,6) since it was not affected yet.\n> \n> Let's think: positions array, after move, new head position, then each body segment takes the previous position of the one before it.\n> \n> So for segment i, it moves to where segment i-1 was.\n> \n> Segment 0 (head) moves to new position.\n> \n> Segment 1 moves to where segment 0 was.\n> \n> Segment 2 moves to where segment 1 was.\n> \n> ...\n> \n> Segment 5 moves to where segment 4 was.\n> \n> Currently, segment 4 is at (5,6), segment 5 at (4,6).\n> \n> After move, if head moves, say to (6,2), new segment 0: (6,2)\n> \n> Segment 1: (6,3)  // old head position\n> \n> Segment 2: (6,4)  // old segment 1\n> \n> Segment 3: (6,5)  // old segment 2\n> \n> Segment 4: (6,6)  // old segment 3\n> \n> Segment 5: (5,6)  // old segment 4\n> \n> Segment 6: (4,6)  // old segment 5? Old segment 5 was at (4,6), and segment 6 moves to where segment 5 was, so segment 6 to (4,6)\n> \n> Old positions: seg0: (6,3), seg1: (6,4), seg2: (6,5), seg3: (6,6), seg4: (5,6), seg5: (4,6), seg6: (3,6), etc.\n> \n> After move down to (6,2):\n> \n> New seg0: (6,2)  // new head\n> \n> New seg1: old seg0 position (6,3)\n> \n> New seg2: old seg1 position (6,4)\n> \n> New seg3: old seg2 position (6,5)\n> \n> New seg4: old seg3 position (6,6)\n> \n> New seg5: old seg4 position (5,6)\n> \n> New seg6: old seg5 position (4,6)\n> \n> New seg7: old seg6 position (3,6)\n> \n> And so on, up to new seg10: old seg9 position (2,4), and old tail seg10 at (2,3) is removed.\n> \n> So after one move, (4,6) is now occupied by new seg6, which is the old seg5 position, so still occupied.\n> \n> Similarly, for any move, the cell (4,6) remains occupied until the segment that is there moves away, which happens when that segment is no longer at the tail end.\n> \n> The segment at (4,6) is currently index 5. It will move when the snake moves, but it moves to a new position only when it is not the tail, but since the tail is removed, the indices shift.\n> \n> The cell (4,6) will be free when the segment that is currently on it is the one that becomes the tail and is removed, or when it moves away.\n> \n> But in this case, index 5 is not the tail; tail is index 10.\n> \n> To free (4,6), we need the snake to move such that the segment at (4,6) is the last one, and when it moves, (4,6) is vacated.\n> \n> Currently, seg5 is at (4,6). This segment will move to a new position when the snake moves, because seg5 will become new seg4 or something, and it moves to where seg4 was.\n> \n> In the move, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> So for the cell (4,6) to be vacated, the segment that is there must move away, and no other segment moves to it immediately.\n> \n> In this case, when the snake moves, seg5 moves to where seg4 was, which is (5,6), so (4,6) is left empty, but then new seg6 moves to (4,6), which is the old position of seg5, so (4,6) is immediately reoccupied by the next segment.\n> \n> Let's see: after move, new seg5 is at old seg4 position, which is (5,6), and new seg6 is at old seg5 position, which is (4,6), so (4,6) is still occupied by new seg6.\n> \n> Similarly, it will be occupied until the tail passes by.\n> \n> Specifically, (4,6) will be free when the segment that was at (4,6) has moved away and the tail has moved past it.\n> \n> Since the snake is moving, (4,6) will be free only when the tail is at (4,6) and then moves away.\n> \n> Currently, tail is at (2,3). The path from (2,3) to (4,6) is not direct, but the snake will move, and eventually the tail will reach (4,6) if the head doesn't eat food.\n> \n> For example, if the snake continues moving, the tail at (2,3) will move to (2,4), then (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), etc., so when the tail reaches (4,6), and then moves away, (4,6) will be vacated.\n> \n> How many turns? From tail at (2,3), to move to (2,4), then (2,5), then (2,6), then (3,6), then (4,6). So after 5 moves, the tail will be at (4,6), and on the 6th move, if no food eaten, the tail moves away from (4,6), and it becomes free.\n> \n> But during this time, the food at (4,6) has a life span of 7 turns, starting from turn 53.\n> \n> Life span 7, so it disappears after 7 turns, meaning it is present on turns 53,54,55,56,57,58,59, and disappears after turn 59, so on turn 60 it's gone.\n> \n> Countdown decreases every turn including current, so at turn 53, life=7, turn 54 life=6, ..., turn 59 life=1, turn 60 life=0, gone.\n> \n> So food at (4,6) available from turn 53 to 59.\n> \n> Tail at (2,3), to reach (4,6): the snake body is fixed for now, but as the head moves, the body shifts.\n> \n> The distance from tail to (4,6): tail at (2,3), (4,6) is at index 5, but indices change.\n> \n> The segment currently at (2,3) is the tail, index 10.\n> \n> The segment at (4,6) is index 5.\n> \n> The number of moves until the tail moves to (4,6) is the number of moves for index 5 to become the tail.\n> \n> Currently, there are 11 segments, so index 5 is the 6th segment from head, 5th from tail? Indices from 0 to 10, head 0, tail 10.\n> \n> Index 5 is 5 positions from head, so when the snake moves without eating, the tail is removed, so after k moves, the segment that was at index k will be the tail when the snake has moved k times.\n> \n> After 0 moves, tail is index 10.\n> \n> After 1 move, tail is index 10 removed, new tail is index 9 (which was the second last).\n> \n> After 2 moves, tail is index 8, and so on.\n> \n> After m moves, the tail is the segment that was at index 10 - m.\n> \n> For example, after 5 moves, tail is the segment that was at index 5.\n> \n> Currently, at turn 53, segment at index 5 is at (4,6).\n> \n> After 5 moves without eating, at turn 58, the segment that was index 5 will be the tail, at some position.\n> \n> But as the snake moves, the position changes.\n> \n> Initially, segment index 5 is at (4,6).\n> \n> After one move, if no eat, it moves to where index 4 was, which is (5,6), and so on.\n> \n> But to have the cell (4,6) free, we need the tail to be at (4,6) and then move away.\n> \n> The tail will reach (4,6) when the segment that was there is the tail, but the position changes.\n> \n> It's messy.\n> \n> Since the snake is moving, the cell (4,6) will be occupied until the tail passes it.\n> \n> The current position of the tail is (2,3), and the body from there to (4,6): from (2,3) to (2,4) to (2,5) to (2,6) to (3,6) to (4,6), so it's 5 cells away, meaning after 5 moves, if the head doesn't eat food and the snake moves such that the body doesn't block, the tail will move to (4,6) on the 5th move.\n> \n> Let's simulate:\n> \n> At turn 53: tail at (2,3)\n> \n> After move at turn 53: head moves, tail removed, new tail at (2,4) if head moves, say, down or left, new tail is the previous index 9, which is (2,4) in positions.\n> \n> Positions: index 8: (2,5), index 9: (2,4), index 10: (2,3)\n> \n> After move, new tail is index 9, which was at (2,4), so tail at (2,4)\n> \n> After turn 54 move, new tail at (2,5) (old index 8)\n> \n> After turn 55, new tail at (2,6) (old index 7)\n> \n> After turn 56, new tail at (3,6) (old index 6)\n> \n> After turn 57, new tail at (4,6) (old index 5)\n> \n> So on turn 57, after the move, tail is at (4,6)\n> \n> Then on turn 58, when the snake moves again, if no food eaten, the tail at (4,6) moves away, and (4,6) is vacated.\n> \n> Food at (4,6) has life span: at turn 53, life=7; turn 54, life=6; turn 55, life=5; turn 56, life=4; turn 57, life=3; turn 58, life=2; turn 59, life=1; turn 60 gone.\n> \n> On turn 58, after the move, (4,6) is free, and food is still there with life=2.\n> \n> Then on turn 58, the head can move to (4,6) to eat the food, if possible.\n> \n> But the head needs to be adjacent to (4,6) on turn 58 to move to it.\n> \n> First, I need to plan the path.\n> \n> Other food at (1,1) with life span 9, so available until turn 61 (since turn 53 life=9, turn 54=8, ..., turn 61=1, turn 62 gone).\n> \n> Now, back to current turn, turn 53, head at (6,3), direction D, possible moves: L to (5,3) or D to (6,2).\n> \n> I need to choose a sequence of actions for 5+ turns.\n> \n> Also, there is a danger with the tail: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it causes collision because the tail grows and head collides.\n> \n> But in this case, food at (4,6) is under body, not tail yet.\n> \n> For now, let's think about getting to the food.\n> \n> First, let's consider moving towards (1,1) or (4,6).\n> \n> (4,6) might be easier to get soon.\n> \n> But to eat (4,6), we need to have it free and head move to it.\n> \n> As above, (4,6) will be free on turn 58 after the move.\n> \n> On turn 58, after the snake moves, (4,6) is vacated, and food is there.\n> \n> Then on turn 58, the head can be at a cell adjacent to (4,6) and move to it.\n> \n> (4,6) has neighbors: (4,5), (4,7) but y=7 wall, (3,6), (5,6).\n> \n> (3,6) and (5,6) are often occupied by the snake, but on turn 58, after the move, what is the snake position?\n> \n> Let's simulate the snake movement assuming no food eaten until then.\n> \n> At turn 53: positions: head (6,3), body: (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3)\n> \n> Direction D.\n> \n> Suppose we move D to (6,2) at turn 53.\n> \n> New positions: head (6,2), then (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4)  // tail (2,3) removed\n> \n> Turn 54: head at (6,2), direction D (since moved down), possible moves: D to (6,1) but (6,1) is an obstacle!

So, I should sketch this grid to visualize.\n> \n> The grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls occupy those cells, meaning the snake can't go there. Borders are all cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Internal obstacles are specific points.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (5,3), then body segments: (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4). So the tail is at (2,4).\n> \n> Snake head direction is L, which is left, so it was moving left to (5,3) from (6,3)? Positions are given head first: [(5,3), (6,3), ...], so from (6,3) to (5,3), it moved left. Current direction is L, so last move was left.\n> \n> Food: There are two food items:\n> \n> - (4,6) with value 1 and life span 6? It says (4,6,6,1) – I think that's (x,y, life_span, value). Let me check the input: \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value: - (4,6,6,1) - (1,1,8,1)\" So for (4,6), life_span=6, value=1. Similarly, (1,1) life_span=8, value=1. Both are positive food since value=1.\n> \n> Life span: for (4,6), it disappears after 6 turns, including current turn? Countdown decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 54, life_span=6, so it will disappear after turn 59? Let's clarify: \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So if life_span is N at turn t, it will be gone by turn t + N - 1? Example: at turn t, life_span=N, after turn t, it becomes N-1, and so on, until life_span=0, it disappears. So it can be eaten from turn t to turn t + N - 1, and at turn t + N, it's gone.\n> \n> Standard: if life_span starts at N on turn t, after one turn, turn t+1, life_span is N-1, and when life_span reaches 0, it disappears. So it exists for N turns: from turn t to turn t + N - 1 inclusive? Let's think carefully.\n> \n> Suppose food spawns at turn t with life_span N. At turn t, life_span=N. After turn t, countdown decreases by 1, so at turn t+1, life_span=N-1. ... At turn t + k, life_span=N-k. When N-k = 0, at turn t + N, life_span=0, and it disappears. So it can be eaten from turn t to turn t + N - 1, since at turn t + N, it's gone.\n> \n> In this case, for (4,6): life_span=6 at turn 54. So it can be eaten from turn 54 to turn 59 (since 54+5=59, life_span=1 on turn 59, gone on turn 60).\n> \n> Similarly, (1,1): life_span=8 at turn 54, can be eaten from turn 54 to turn 61.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (5,3), direction L (left). Possible moves: since direction is L, I can move L, U, or D, but not R because no instant reverse. Rules: \"no instant reverse: cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\" Current direction is L, so opposite is R, so I cannot move right on this turn. Possible moves: Left (continuing left), Up, or Down.\n> \n> But I have to consider walls and body collisions.\n> \n> First, let's map the grid.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls:\n> \n> - Border: all cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7.\n> \n> - Internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1)\n> \n> Snake positions: head (5,3), then (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4)\n> \n> So tail is (2,4).\n> \n> Food at (4,6) and (1,1).\n> \n> (4,6) is a food position, but look at snake positions: (4,6) is part of the snake body! Snake has (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), etc. Specifically, (4,6) is the 7th segment? Let's list:\n> \n> Index: 0: head (5,3)\n> \n> 1: (6,3)\n> \n> 2: (6,4)\n> \n> 3: (6,5)\n> \n> 4: (6,6)\n> \n> 5: (5,6)\n> \n> 6: (4,6)\n> \n> 7: (3,6)\n> \n> 8: (2,6)\n> \n> 9: (2,5)\n> \n> 10: tail (2,4)\n> \n> So (4,6) is occupied by the snake body, segment 6.\n> \n> But food is at (4,6), with life_span 6, value 1.\n> \n> Rules: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> Also, \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> First, since food is under the body at (4,6), to eat it, the snake must move so that the body moves away from (4,6), and then head moves there.\n> \n> Currently, (4,6) is occupied by segment 6. When the snake moves, the tail moves, but since it's not the tail, it might take a few moves to free up the cell.\n> \n> Also, life_span is 6, so it has from turn 54 to 59 to be eaten.\n> \n> Now, head is at (5,3), and (4,6) is at (4,6), which is not adjacent; it's 3 units away in x and 3 in y, so Manhattan distance 6, not close.\n> \n> The other food is at (1,1), far away.\n> \n> I need to plan moves to maximize score, thinking 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> First, possible actions for turn 54.\n> \n> Head at (5,3), direction L, so cannot move R. Possible: L, U, D.\n> \n> - Left (L): to (4,3)\n> \n> - Up (U): to (5,4)\n> \n> - Down (D): to (5,2)\n> \n> Now, check for collisions or walls.\n> \n> First, (4,3): is it wall or body?\n> \n> Walls: internal obstacles, (5,2) is wall, but (4,3) is not listed as wall. Borders: x=0 or 7, y=0 or 7, so (4,3) is within 1-6? x=4, y=3, both between 1 and 6? Grid is 0 to 7, so cells with x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6 are not border walls, except internal obstacles.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1)\n> \n> (4,3) is not in this list, and not border, so safe from walls.\n> \n> Now, body: snake positions: (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4)\n> \n> (4,3) is not in this list, so no body collision.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,4): not wall, not body? Body has (6,4), but (5,4) is not listed, so empty.\n> \n> (5,2): but (5,2) is an internal obstacle, wall! So cannot move down to (5,2).\n> \n> So possible moves: L to (4,3) or U to (5,4). D is invalid.\n> \n> Now, I need to think ahead multiple turns.\n> \n> Food at (4,6) is under the body, so we need to move the snake so that the segment at (4,6) moves away.\n> \n> Currently, segment at (4,6) is index 6. When the snake moves, the head moves to a new position, and each segment moves to the previous position of the one before it. So when head moves, segment 1 moves to old head position, segment 2 to old segment 1, etc., and the tail segment is removed unless food is eaten.\n> \n> But since we don't eat food, tail moves, so the cell that was tail is freed.\n> \n> To free (4,6), which is currently occupied, we need the snake to move such that the segment at (4,6) moves to a different position.\n> \n> Since the snake moves one step at a time, we need to advance the snake so that the body part on (4,6) is no longer there.\n> \n> Currently, positions: let's list the path.\n> \n> From head: (5,3) -> to (6,3) -> (6,4) -> (6,5) -> (6,6) -> (5,6) -> (4,6) -> (3,6) -> (2,6) -> (2,5) -> (2,4) tail.\n> \n> So the segment at (4,6) will move when the snake moves. When head moves, segment 6 (at (4,6)) will move to where segment 5 was, which is (5,6), but segment 5 is at (5,6), and when head moves, segment 1 moves to (5,3), segment 2 to (6,3), ..., segment 5 to (6,6)? Let's think of the movement.\n> \n> Standard snake: when head moves to a new cell, the tail end is removed, so the body segments shift: the cell that was head becomes body, and the last body cell is removed.\n> \n> In terms of positions: after one move without eating, head moves to new position, and the tail position is removed.\n> \n> So the body segments remain, but each is shifted.\n> \n> For cell occupancy: after move, the new head position is occupied, and the old tail position is vacated.\n> \n> For a specific cell like (4,6), it is currently occupied by the snake. When the snake moves, if (4,6) is not the tail, it will be occupied by the next segment.\n> \n> (4,6) is segment 6. The tail is segment 10 at (2,4).\n> \n> When snake moves, head moves to new position, say P. Then the new body starts from old head position (5,3), then (6,3), etc., up to segment 9, and the new tail is old segment 9 position, which was (2,5)? Let's index properly.\n> \n> Positions list: index 0: head, 1: body1, 2: body2, ..., 10: tail.\n> \n> After move without eating:\n> \n> - New head at the moved position\n> \n> - New body segments: from old index 0 to 9, but shifted. Specifically, new body segment 1 is old head position, new body segment 2 is old body1 position, ..., new body segment 10 is old body9 position.\n> \n> Old tail (index 10) is removed.\n> \n> So for cell (4,6), it is currently occupied by old index 6.\n> \n> After a move, if no food eaten, the snake shortens, but the positions: new index 6 will be the old index 5 position? Let's see.\n> \n> After move:\n> \n> - New head: moved to\n> \n> - New pos1: old head (5,3)\n> \n> - New pos2: old pos1 (6,3)\n> \n> - New pos3: old pos2 (6,4)\n> \n> - New pos4: old pos3 (6,5)\n> \n> - New pos5: old pos4 (6,6)\n> \n> - New pos6: old pos5 (5,6)  // this is the cell that was (5,6)\n> \n> - New pos7: old pos6 (4,6)  // so (4,6) is now occupied by new pos7, which is old pos6, so still occupied, but by a different segment.\n> \n> The cell (4,6) is still occupied after the move, because old pos6 moves to new pos7, but it's the same cell until the segment moves.\n> \n> When the snake moves, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment. So the segment that was at (4,6) will move to where the segment in front of it was.\n> \n> In this case, the segment at (4,6) is following the segment at (5,6). When the snake moves, the segment at (5,6) will move to a new position based on the head movement, but the head is at (5,3), not connected directly.\n> \n> The path is: from head (5,3) to (6,3), then to (6,4), etc., so the segment at (5,6) is connected to (6,6) and to (4,6)? Positions: (5,6) is connected to (6,6) and to (4,6), since it's a chain.\n> \n> The segment at (5,6) has neighbors: behind it is (6,6), ahead it is (4,6) in the list? List: (6,6) at index 4, (5,6) at index 5, (4,6) at index 6. So from head, it goes to body, so (5,6) is followed by (4,6), and (5,6) is preceded by (6,6).\n> \n> When the snake moves, the head moves to a new cell. Then, each body segment moves to the position of the segment it was following.\n> \n> Specifically, for segment at (4,6), it was following (5,6), so it will move to (5,6) only if (5,6) doesn't move, but (5,6) will move to where its predecessor was, and so on.\n> \n> But when head moves, (5,6) will move to where the segment before it was, but it's easier to think that all segments except the head move to the position of the previous segment in the list.\n> \n> After head moves to new position, the body segment that was at position i moves to the position that was i-1.\n> \n> For example, when head moves from (5,3) to say (4,3), then:\n> \n> - New head at (4,3)\n> \n> - The body segment that was at (6,3) (index 1) moves to old head position (5,3)\n> \n> - The body segment that was at (6,4) (index 2) moves to old index 1 position (6,3)\n> \n> - Index 3 at (6,5) moves to (6,4)\n> \n> - Index 4 at (6,6) moves to (6,5)\n> \n> - Index 5 at (5,6) moves to (6,6)\n> \n> - Index 6 at (4,6) moves to (5,6)  // so now (4,6) is vacated because the segment that was there moved to (5,6)\n> \n> - Then index 7 at (3,6) moves to (4,6)  // (4,6) is occupied again\n> \n> After the move, the cell (4,6) is occupied by the segment that was at (3,6), because index 6 moves to (5,6), and index 7 moves to old index 6 position, which is (4,6).\n> \n> Similarly, the tail moves to old second last position.\n> \n> But the key point is that the cell (4,6) is never vacated because when one segment leaves, another moves in immediately, since the snake is contiguous.\n> \n> For a body cell to be vacated, it must be the tail, and when the tail moves, the cell is freed.\n> \n> Otherwise, for internal body cells, when the snake moves, the cell may be occupied by a different segment, but it's still occupied.\n> \n> To free (4,6), it must become the tail at some point, so that when the snake moves, the tail leaves and no one moves in.\n> \n> Currently, (4,6) is index 6, not tail. The tail is (2,4).\n> \n> To make (4,6) the tail, we need to move the snake in such a way that the segments after it are reduced, but since we don't eat food, the length stays the same, so (4,6) will only be tail when all segments after it have been moved past, but that's not how it works.\n> \n> The tail is always the last segment, and it moves when the head moves, freeing the old tail cell.\n> \n> For (4,6) to be free, it needs to be the tail position at some move.\n> \n> But currently, it's not the tail, and we can't shorten the snake without eating, so (4,6) will only be freed when it becomes the tail, which requires that the snake moves in a way that the path shortens towards it, but with constant length, it only happens if we eat food to grow, but we're not eating yet.\n> \n> Let's think differently.\n> \n> The cell (4,6) is occupied by the snake. When the snake moves, if no food is eaten, the tail is removed, so the cell that was tail is freed. For (4,6) to be freed, it must be the current tail at that move.\n> \n> Since the tail is at (2,4), and (4,6) is far, it will take several moves for (4,6) to become the tail, as the snake moves.\n> \n> Specifically, the distance from head to the food cell in terms of body segments.\n> \n> The food is at index 6, so there are 5 segments after it (indices 7 to 11? Indices: 6 is (4,6), then 7:(3,6), 8:(2,6), 9:(2,5), 10:(2,4) tail. So 4 segments after it.\n> \n> When the snake moves without eating, the tail is removed, so after one move, the new tail is old index 9, which was (2,5).\n> \n> After two moves, new tail is old index 8, (2,6), and so on.\n> \n> After k moves without eating, the new tail is the old position of index (10 - k + 1) or something.\n> \n> Initial positions: index 0 to 10, 11 segments.\n> \n> After one move without eating, new snake has 10 segments: new index 0 to 9, with new tail at old index 9 position.\n> \n> Old index 9 is (2,5).\n> \n> After two moves, new snake has 9 segments, tail at old index 8 position (2,6).\n> \n> After three moves, tail at old index 7 position (3,6).\n> \n> After four moves, tail at old index 6 position (4,6).\n> \n> So after exactly 4 moves without eating, the segment that was at (4,6) becomes the tail.\n> \n> At that point, when the snake moves on the next turn, if it doesn't eat, the tail moves, and (4,6) is freed.\n> \n> Then, if the head moves to (4,6), it can eat the food.\n> \n> But the food is there, and we need to time it.\n> \n> Also, life_span: at turn 54, life_span=6 for (4,6), so it can be eaten until turn 59.\n> \n> We have from turn 54 to 59.\n> \n> Now, to free (4,6), we need to make it the tail, which takes 4 moves without eating.\n> \n> So if we make 4 moves without eating food, on the 5th move, (4,6) is freed, and we can move head there to eat.\n> \n> Sequence:\n> \n> - After 0 moves (turn 54): tail at (2,4)\n> \n> - After 1 move (turn 55): tail at old (2,5) or new tail position, but the cell (4,6) is still occupied.\n> \n> After k moves, the cell that was index (10 - k) becomes the tail when k=4, index 6.\n> \n> Initial indices: 0:head, 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10:tail\n> \n> After first move (no eat): new indices 0 to 9, tail is old index 9\n> \n> After second move: new indices 0 to 8, tail is old index 8\n> \n> After third move: new indices 0 to 7, tail is old index 7\n> \n> After fourth move: new indices 0 to 6, tail is old index 6\n> \n> So after four moves, the new snake has the tail at the position that was previously index 6, which is (4,6).\n> \n> Then, on the fifth move, if we move to (4,6), we can eat the food, but at that point, (4,6) is the current tail position, and if we move head there, it might cause collision.\n> \n> Rules: when head moves to a cell, if it's food, it eats, length increases.\n> \n> But \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head is adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> In this case, when (4,6) is the tail, and we move head to (4,6), but (4,6) is the current tail, so if we move head to the tail position, it's like the head is moving to where the tail is, but when we eat, the tail doesn't move, so new head is at (4,6), and the tail stays, so it grows, and since head is on tail, it collides with itself.\n> \n> Specifically, when you eat food, you grow, so the tail doesn't move, and head moves to food cell, which was tail, so head and tail are on same cell, which is collision, death.\n> \n> Therefore, we cannot eat food that is under the tail when we move to it; it must be freed first.\n> \n> In this case, for (4,6), when it becomes the tail, we cannot eat it by moving to it directly because it causes collision.\n> \n> We need to free the cell first: when (4,6) is the tail, on the next move, if we move away, the tail moves to the next position, freeing (4,6), then on the subsequent move, we can move head to (4,6) to eat, but only if food is still there.\n> \n> Let's outline:\n> \n> Turn t: after some moves, (4,6) is tail.\n> \n> Turn t: snake head somewhere, tail at (4,6)\n> \n> Turn t: move head to some position, not eating (assume), so tail moves to the previous position, freeing (4,6).

Make (4,6) the tail by moving 4 times without eating any food. During these moves, we don't eat, so length decreases by one each move? No, when we move without eating, length stays the same, but the tail moves, so the body shortens from the tail end.\n> \n> After 4 moves without eating, the snake has 11 - 4 = 7 segments, and the tail is at the position that was (4,6).\n> \n> Then, on the next move (fifth move), we move the head to a different position, so the tail moves, freeing (4,6).\n> \n> Then, on the sixth move, we move head to (4,6) to eat, if food is there.\n> \n> But we need to ensure that during these moves, we don't die and that head can reach (4,6) on that turn.\n> \n> Also, life_span: at turn 54, life_span=6 for (4,6).\n> \n> Let t=54.\n> \n> After 4 moves: turns 54,55,56,57, we move without eating.\n> \n> At start of turn 54, life_span=6.\n> \n> After turn 54, if not eaten, life_span decreases to 5.\n> \n> After turn 55, to 4, and so on.\n> \n> After turn 58, life_span=0?

        "thinking": "Let's analyze the current state and possible moves step-by-step to determine the best immediate action for Turn 55.\n\n### Current State (Turn 55):\n- **Snake Positions**: Head at (4,3), body segments follow: (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5).\n- **Head Direction**: Left (L) (last move was from (5,3) to (4,3)).\n- **Food**:\n  - (4,6): Value +1, Life Span 5 (disappears after Turn 59).\n  - (1,1): Value +1, Life Span 7 (disappears after Turn 61).\n  - (4,3): Value +1, Life Span 10 (disappears after Turn 64). **Note**: Head is currently on (4,3), but food under the head cannot be eaten unless the head moves away and back (rules clarification).\n\n### Possible Moves from (4,3):\n- Cannot reverse direction (no move Right (R) since last move was Left (L)).\n- **Up (U)**: (4,4) is a wall (internal obstacle). Invalid.\n- **Down (D)**: (4,2) is free (no wall or body).\n- **Left (L)**: (3,3) is free (no wall or body).\n\n### Valid Moves: Down (D) or Left (L).\n\n#### Option 1: Move Down (D) to (4,2)\n- **Pros**:\n  - Moves away from the coiled body, potentially opening space.\n  - Avoids immediate collisions.\n- **Cons**:\n  - Moves away from food at (4,3) and (4,6), making it harder to eat them later.\n  - May lead to dead ends if not careful.\n\n#### Option 2: Move Left (L) to (3,3)\n- **Pros**:\n  - Moves toward the left side, potentially opening paths to (1,1) (though eating (1,1) is risky as it leads to a dead end).\n  - Keeps the snake's body more compact, which might help in future maneuvers.\n- **Cons**:\n  - Moves away from food at (4,6), which has a short lifespan (must be eaten by Turn 59).\n  - (1,1) is a dead end if eaten directly.\n\n### Analysis of Food:\n1. **(4,6)**:\n   - To eat, must free the cell by moving the tail to (4,6) and then move the head onto it.\n   - Requires precise maneuvering and may not be feasible within the remaining lifespan (5 turns).\n   - High risk of collision or running out of time.\n\n2. **(1,1)**:\n   - Eating it directly leads to a dead end (no exit after eating).\n   - Not a viable target unless the snake can approach it differently (currently not possible).\n\n3. **(4,3)**:\n   - Currently under the head but cannot be eaten until the head moves away and back.\n   - Long lifespan (10 turns), so can be targeted later.\n\n### Decision:\nGiven the constraints and risks:\n- Moving **Left (L)** to (3,3) is safer and avoids immediate dead ends. It also keeps the snake's body more manageable for future moves.\n- Moving **Down (D)** to (4,2) is also safe but may complicate future attempts to eat food due to the snake's elongated body.\n\n### Immediate Action:\nChoose **Left (L)** to (3,3) to maintain flexibility and avoid immediate risks. \n\n\\boxed{L}",

That's 11 segments. Head direction is left (L), so last move was left, meaning from (5,3) to (4,3), I think. Positions are given head first, so (4,3) is head, then (5,3) is the first body segment, which was the previous head position.\n> \n> Head direction L means the snake is facing left, so moving left to (4,3) from (5,3).\n> \n> Food positions with value and life span:\n> \n> - (4,6) with value 1, life span 5\n> \n> - (1,1) with value 1, life span 7\n> \n> - (4,3) with value 1, life span 10\n> \n> (4,3) is the head position?

Let me clarify.\n> \n> The snake positions list has the head at index 0, so (4,3) is head, and body segments start from index 1: (5,3), etc. So (4,3) is occupied by the head, not by a body segment. Therefore, food at (4,3) is under the head, so it should be eatable now.\n> \n> But the rule says: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body\" – body, not head.

The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> It specifies \"under the snake's body\", meaning not under the head. If food is under the head, it can be eaten when the head is on it, I assume.\n> \n> In this state, food at (4,3) is listed, and head is at (4,3), so probably, at the start of the turn, if head is on food, it gets eaten, I think.

So (4,6) is the 8th segment, which is a body segment, not head. So food at (4,6) is under the body.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,3) is head, so food under head.\n> \n> I think for food under head, it can be eaten immediately, but for food under body, it requires the body to move away and head to move onto it later.\n> \n> But for the current turn, at (4,3), since head is there, I think it gets eaten at the start or after move? I need to clarify the sequence.\n> \n> The action sequence is for turns starting from t1, so for turn 55, I choose an action, then the snake moves, then if the new head position has food, it is eaten, and the snake grows (if positive food).\n> \n> Similarly, for food under body, it remains until the body moves away and head moves onto it.\n> \n> In this state, for (4,3), head is on it, so when I move, the head will leave, but the food is there, so if I move away, the food is still there, under the head position, but head is moving away, so the cell is now empty or what?\n> \n> I think I'm confusing myself.\n> \n> Let's assume the standard Snake game mechanics: at each turn, the snake moves one cell in the chosen direction. If the new head position has food, the food is eaten, the snake grows, and the food disappears. If no food, the tail moves, so snake length stays the same.\n> \n> But here, food can be under the body, so it's not eaten until the head moves onto it after the body leaves.\n> \n> For the current state, at turn 55 start, head is at (4,3) with food, so when I move, the head moves to a new position, and the old position (4,3) becomes body, so the food at (4,3) is now under the body, not eaten.\n> \n> Then, for the food to be eaten, the body must move away (i.e., the snake moves so that the segment at (4,3) moves to another cell, freeing it), and later the head moves onto (4,3) when it's free.\n> \n> Similarly for (4,6), it's under body now.\n> \n> So in this case, at turn 55, head is at (4,3) with food, but since I'm about to move, the food will not be eaten because the head is leaving the cell without eating it? That seems odd.\n> \n> Perhaps the eating happens before the move or after.\n> \n> I think there's ambiguity. Let me look for clues in the rules.\n> \n> The rule says: \"the head moves onto the food cell\" for eating, so it's when the head enters a cell with food.\n> \n> In the current state, the head is already on (4,3) with food, but it didn't \"move onto\" it; it's already there. So for it to be eaten, it must have been eaten when it moved to (4,3), but that was on a previous turn.\n> \n> The state is given at the beginning of turn 55, before any action.\n> \n> So at the beginning of turn 55, the snake head is at (4,3), and there is food at (4,3), so presumably, this food was not eaten when the snake moved to (4,3), which could be because it was under the body or something.\n> \n> I think I need to assume that for food under the head, it can be eaten, but the rule doesn't specify.\n> \n> Let's read the rule carefully: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> It says \"under the snake's body\", not under the head. So if food is under the head, it might be eatable immediately.\n> \n> But in the state, (4,3) has food and head is there, so for turn 55, when I choose an action, if I do nothing, but I have to move.\n> \n> Perhaps the food is listed as present, but since head is on it, it will be eaten at the end of the turn or something.\n> \n> To resolve this, let's think logically. If the head is on a food cell at the start of the turn, it should be considered for eating. But in Snake, eating usually happens when you move onto the cell.\n> \n> I think for consistency, eating occurs when the snake moves to a cell with food. So at the start of turn, if head is on food, it means it was not eaten, perhaps because it spawned there or something.\n> \n> In this case, for (4,3), since head is on it at start, and I move away, the food remains, and it's now under the body.\n> \n> Similarly, for (4,6), it's under body.\n> \n> So for both, to eat them, I need to have the body move away and then head move onto it.\n> \n> For (4,3), since head is leaving, it will be under body after this move.\n> \n> I think that's the way to interpret.\n> \n> So at turn 55, I choose a direction to move the head from (4,3).\n> \n> Current head direction is L, so I can move U, D, L, R, but no instant reverse, so since last move was L (to (4,3) from (5,3)), I cannot move R (right) immediately, because that would be opposite.\n> \n> So possible moves: U (up, to (4,4)), D (down, to (4,2)), L (left, to (3,3)), R is not allowed because reverse.\n> \n> R is right, which is opposite to left, so cannot move R.\n> \n> So options: U, D, or L.\n> \n> Now, let's map the grid.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls at borders and internal obstacles.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1)\n> \n> Also borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls.\n> \n> Snake positions: head (4,3), then (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5)\n> \n> So the snake is coiled around.\n> \n> Now, food:\n> - (4,6): value 1, life span 5, so disappears after turn 55 + 5 = 60? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 55, life span 5, so it will disappear after 5 turns, meaning on turn 60 it is gone. Similarly, at turn t, life span N, it will be there for N turns, disappearing after N decreases to 0.\n> \n> Life span: \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so at turn 55, for (4,6), life span 5, so after turn 55, countdown to 4, then turn 56 to 3, etc., until turn 59 countdown 1, turn 60 countdown 0 and disappears. So available from turn 55 to 59 inclusive.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,1) life span 7, available turns 55 to 61.\n> \n> (4,3) life span 10, available turns 55 to 64.\n> \n> But (4,3) is under head, but as we said, not eaten yet.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan a sequence of actions for at least 5 turns: 55 to 60 or more.\n> \n> But first, let's find safe moves from (4,3).\n> \n> Possible moves from (4,3):\n> \n> - U: to (4,4) – but (4,4) is an internal obstacle?

Walls: borders, and internal (5,2), but not (4,2), so (4,2) should be free. Snake body: positions are (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), etc., no (4,2), so empty. Also not wall. So (4,2) is free.\n> \n> - L: to (3,3) – (3,3) free? Walls: internal (3,4) is wall, but (3,3) not listed, and not border, so should be free.

Let's see.\n> \n> After move: head to (4,2), then body segments: previous head (4,3) now first body, then (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), and tail (2,5) is removed since no growth. So new positions: [(4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6)] — 11 segments, same length.\n> \n> (2,5) removed, so (2,6) is now the last segment.\n> \n> Similarly, if I go L to (3,3), head to (3,3), body: (4,3), (5,3), etc., tail removed, new positions: [(3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6)] — and (2,5) removed.\n> \n> In both cases, the food at (4,3) is now under the body at (4,3), since (4,3) is now a body segment.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (4,6) is still under body.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan to eat food while avoiding collisions.\n> \n> Also, there is a risk: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> But tail cell is where the tail is, which will move.\n> \n> For example, if head moves to a cell adjacent to tail, and that cell has food, and I eat it, the tail doesn't move, so snake grows, but then head is where tail was, and tail is still there, but since I grow, a new segment is added at tail, so head and new tail are at same position?

So the grid is 8x8 from (0,0) to (7,7), I assume, since borders are at x=0,7 and y=0,7.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (4,3), then body segments: (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5). That's 11 segments. Head direction is left (L), so last move was left, meaning from (5,3) to (4,3), I think. Positions are given head first, so (4,3) is head, then (5,3) is the first body segment, which was the previous head position.\n> \n> Head direction L means the snake is facing left, so moving left to (4,3) from (5,3).\n> \n> Food positions with value and life span:\n> \n> - (4,6) with value 1, life span 5\n> \n> - (1,1) with value 1, life span 7\n> \n> - (4,3) with value 1, life span 10\n> \n> (4,3) is the head position? But food can spawn under the snake's body, and it says (4,3) has food. But the head is currently at (4,3), so if food is there, can I eat it immediately?\n> \n> According to the rules: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> But here, the head is already on (4,3), which has food. But for eating to happen, the body must move away first? Let me read carefully.\n> \n> It says: \"can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> Since the head is already on the cell, but if the body is also on it, the body needs to move away before the head can eat it. But in this case, (4,3) is the head, so no body is on it now. Let's see the snake positions: [(4,3), (5,3), ...] so (4,3) is head, and (5,3) is the next segment. So the food at (4,3) is under the head.\n> \n> But to eat food, the head must move onto it, but it's already on it? I think there might be a misunderstanding.\n> \n> Perhaps when the snake moves to a cell with food, it eats it. But the rule specifies that for food under the body, it requires the body to move away first.\n> \n> In this case, since the head is on (4,3) and food is there, I think it should be eaten immediately if possible, but the rule says for food under the body, it needs the body to move away.\n> \n> (4,3) is the head, not the body. Let me clarify.\n> \n> The snake positions list has the head at index 0, so (4,3) is head, and body segments start from index 1: (5,3), etc. So (4,3) is occupied by the head, not by a body segment. Therefore, food at (4,3) is under the head, so it should be eatable now.\n> \n> But the rule says: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body\" – body, not head. Head is separate.\n> \n> Let me read the rule again: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> It specifies \"under the snake's body\", meaning not under the head. If food is under the head, it can be eaten when the head is on it, I assume.\n> \n> In this state, food at (4,3) is listed, and head is at (4,3), so probably, at the start of the turn, if head is on food, it gets eaten, I think. But the rule doesn't explicitly say.\n> \n> Let's see the input: \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value: - (4, 6, 5, 1) - (1, 1, 7, 1) - (4, 3, 10, 1)\"\n> \n> And snake positions: head at (4,3), so (4,3) has food and head is there.\n> \n> I think that means the food is under the head, and it should be eatable, but the rule says for body, not head. I need to interpret.\n> \n> Perhaps at the beginning of the turn, if the head is on a food cell, it is eaten, and the snake grows.\n> \n> But in this case, since the head is on (4,3) with food, it should be eaten now, on turn 55, before I make a move.\n> \n> But let's confirm the turn sequence. The state is given for turn t1=55, and I need to choose an action for turn t1.\n> \n> Typically in such games, the state is observed, then the snake moves, and if after move, head is on food, it eats.\n> \n> But here, food is listed at positions including where snake is.\n> \n> For example, (4,6) is also a food position, and snake has a segment at (4,6) – let's see snake positions: positions are (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5). So (4,6) is the 8th segment, which is a body segment, not head. So food at (4,6) is under the body.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,3) is head, so food under head.\n> \n> I think for food under head, it can be eaten immediately, but for food under body, it requires the body to move away and head to move onto it later.\n> \n> But for the current turn, at (4,3), since head is there, I think it gets eaten at the start or after move? I need to clarify the sequence.\n> \n> The action sequence is for turns starting from t1, so for turn 55, I choose an action, then the snake moves, then if the new head position has food, it is eaten, and the snake grows (if positive food).\n> \n> Similarly, for food under body, it remains until the body moves away and head moves onto it.\n> \n> In this state, for (4,3), head is on it, so when I move, the head will leave, but the food is there, so if I move away, the food is still there, under the head position, but head is moving away, so the cell is now empty or what?\n> \n> I think I'm confusing myself.\n> \n> Let's assume the standard Snake game mechanics: at each turn, the snake moves one cell in the chosen direction. If the new head position has food, the food is eaten, the snake grows, and the food disappears. If no food, the tail moves, so snake length stays the same.\n> \n> But here, food can be under the body, so it's not eaten until the head moves onto it after the body leaves.\n> \n> For the current state, at turn 55 start, head is at (4,3) with food, so when I move, the head moves to a new position, and the old position (4,3) becomes body, so the food at (4,3) is now under the body, not eaten.\n> \n> Then, for the food to be eaten, the body must move away (i.e., the snake moves so that the segment at (4,3) moves to another cell, freeing it), and later the head moves onto (4,3) when it's free.\n> \n> Similarly for (4,6), it's under body now.\n> \n> So in this case, at turn 55, head is at (4,3) with food, but since I'm about to move, the food will not be eaten because the head is leaving the cell without eating it? That seems odd.\n> \n> Perhaps the eating happens before the move or after.\n> \n> I think there's ambiguity. Let me look for clues in the rules.\n> \n> The rule says: \"the head moves onto the food cell\" for eating, so it's when the head enters a cell with food.\n> \n> In the current state, the head is already on (4,3) with food, but it didn't \"move onto\" it; it's already there. So for it to be eaten, it must have been eaten when it moved to (4,3), but that was on a previous turn.\n> \n> The state is given at the beginning of turn 55, before any action.\n> \n> So at the beginning of turn 55, the snake head is at (4,3), and there is food at (4,3), so presumably, this food was not eaten when the snake moved to (4,3), which could be because it was under the body or something.\n> \n> I think I need to assume that for food under the head, it can be eaten, but the rule doesn't specify.\n> \n> Let's read the rule carefully: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> It says \"under the snake's body\", not under the head. So if food is under the head, it might be eatable immediately.\n> \n> But in the state, (4,3) has food and head is there, so for turn 55, when I choose an action, if I do nothing, but I have to move.\n> \n> Perhaps the food is listed as present, but since head is on it, it will be eaten at the end of the turn or something.\n> \n> To resolve this, let's think logically. If the head is on a food cell at the start of the turn, it should be considered for eating. But in Snake, eating usually happens when you move onto the cell.\n> \n> I think for consistency, eating occurs when the snake moves to a cell with food. So at the start of turn, if head is on food, it means it was not eaten, perhaps because it spawned there or something.\n> \n> In this case, for (4,3), since head is on it at start, and I move away, the food remains, and it's now under the body.\n> \n> Similarly, for (4,6), it's under body.\n> \n> So for both, to eat them, I need to have the body move away and then head move onto it.\n> \n> For (4,3), since head is leaving, it will be under body after this move.\n> \n> I think that's the way to interpret.\n> \n> So at turn 55, I choose a direction to move the head from (4,3).\n> \n> Current head direction is L, so I can move U, D, L, R, but no instant reverse, so since last move was L (to (4,3) from (5,3)), I cannot move R (right) immediately, because that would be opposite.\n> \n> So possible moves: U (up, to (4,4)), D (down, to (4,2)), L (left, to (3,3)), R is not allowed because reverse.\n> \n> R is right, which is opposite to left, so cannot move R.\n> \n> So options: U, D, or L.\n> \n> Now, let's map the grid.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls at borders and internal obstacles.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1)\n> \n> Also borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls.\n> \n> Snake positions: head (4,3), then (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5)\n> \n> So the snake is coiled around.\n> \n> Now, food:\n> - (4,6): value 1, life span 5, so disappears after turn 55 + 5 = 60? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 55, life span 5, so it will disappear after 5 turns, meaning on turn 60 it is gone. Similarly, at turn t, life span N, it will be there for N turns, disappearing after N decreases to 0.\n> \n> Life span: \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so at turn 55, for (4,6), life span 5, so after turn 55, countdown to 4, then turn 56 to 3, etc., until turn 59 countdown 1, turn 60 countdown 0 and disappears. So available from turn 55 to 59 inclusive.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,1) life span 7, available turns 55 to 61.\n> \n> (4,3) life span 10, available turns 55 to 64.\n> \n> But (4,3) is under head, but as we said, not eaten yet.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan a sequence of actions for at least 5 turns: 55 to 60 or more.\n> \n> But first, let's find safe moves from (4,3).\n> \n> Possible moves from (4,3):\n> \n> - U: to (4,4) – but (4,4) is an internal obstacle?

Walls: borders, and internal (5,2), but not (4,2), so (4,2) should be free. Snake body: positions are (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), etc., no (4,2), so empty. Also not wall. So (4,2) is free.\n> \n> - L: to (3,3) – (3,3) free? Walls: internal (3,4) is wall, but (3,3) not listed, and not border, so should be free.

So after two moves without eating, (4,6) becomes the tail.\n> \n> Then, on the next move, if I don't eat, the tail moves away, freeing (4,6), and head can move to it later.\n> \n> But it takes 2 moves to make it tail, then on the third move, if I move without eating, it frees.\n> \n> From turn 55, after moving to (4,2), on turn 56 I need to move without eating, turn 57 move without eating, then on turn 58, if I move without eating, (4,6) is freed, and on turn 58 or later, head can move to it.\n> \n> But (4,6) life span: at turn 55, life 5, after turn 55, life 4 (for turn 56), turn 56 life 3, turn 57 life 2, turn 58 life 1, so on turn 58, if I free it and head moves to it, it can be eaten.\n> \n> Similarly, on turn 59, life 0, disappears.\n> \n> So possible to eat on turn 58.\n> \n> But it requires two moves without eating to make it tail, then on the third move, free it, but when I free it, the head is somewhere else, so I need to have the head move to (4,6) on the same turn or later.\n> \n> When I move on turn 58, if I move such that the tail leaves (4,6), freeing it, and simultaneously, if I move the head to (4,6), I can eat it.\n> \n> But the head moving to (4,6) and tail leaving can happen on the same turn.\n> \n> For example, on turn 58, if tail is at (4,6), and I move the head to (4,6), but head moving to tail position: if head is adjacent to tail, and I move to tail position to eat food, but there is the tail reward danger.\n> \n> Let's see.\n> \n> If on turn 58, tail is at (4,6), which has food, and head is at some position adjacent to (4,6).\n> \n> Possible adjacent cells to (4,6): (4,5), (4,7) but y=7 wall, (3,6), (5,6).\n> \n> (5,6) is wall? Internal obstacles: (5,5) is wall, but (5,6) not listed, so not wall. (4,5) not wall, (3,6) not wall.\n> \n> But (4,7) is border wall.\n> \n> So adjacent: (4,5), (3,6), (5,6).\n> \n> Now, if head is at one of these, say (4,5), and I move to (4,6), which is tail position with food.\n> \n> Then, since head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has food, if I eat it, I die because of collision.\n> \n> Similarly, if head at (3,6), move to (4,6), same thing.\n> \n> Or at (5,6), move to (4,6), same.\n> \n> So I cannot eat the food on the tail cell if head is adjacent; it causes death.\n> \n> Therefore, to eat (4,6), I need to free it first by moving the tail away, then later move head to it when it's free and no adjacent issue.\n> \n> But once freed, I can move head to it directly.\n> \n> In the sequence, when I free (4,6) on turn 58 by moving the tail away, at that moment, the head is not on it, so no problem, then on a subsequent turn, I can move head to (4,6) to eat, as long as life span >0.\n> \n> On turn 58, after moving, (4,6) is free, and life span is 1, so on turn 59, if I move to (4,6), it can be eaten, but life span at turn 59 is 0, so it might be gone.\n> \n> Life span at turn 58: during turn 58, before move, life span is 1 (since decreased at start of turn or end?).\n> \n> The rule: \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so at the beginning of each turn, the countdown decreases.\n> \n> For food at turn t, life span N, at start of turn t, countdown N, then during the turn, if head moves to it, it is eaten, then at end of turn, countdown decreases to N-1 for next turn, but if eaten, it's removed.\n> \n> Disappears after N turns, meaning it lasts for N full turns.\n> \n> Assume that at the start of turn t, for a food with life span L, it has countdown L, and if during the turn head moves to it, it is eaten. At the end of the turn, countdown decreases by 1, so for next turn it has countdown L-1. If countdown reaches 0 at start of turn, it disappears before any action.\n> \n> Standard way: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn including current\", so for example, at turn 55, life span 5, so it is present. After turn 55, countdown to 4, so at turn 56, countdown 4, and so on, until after turn 59, countdown to 0, so at turn 60, it is gone.\n> \n> So the food can be eaten on turns 55 to 59 inclusive, as long as countdown >0 during the turn.\n> \n> On turn 59, countdown is 1, so can be eaten.\n> \n> On turn 60, countdown 0, gone.\n> \n> For (4,6), can be eaten on turns 55,56,57,58,59.\n> \n> But to eat it, I need it free.\n> \n> To free it, I need to have the tail at (4,6) and then move without eating to free it.\n> \n> As above, from turn 55 move to (4,2), then after two moves without eating, on turn 57, (4,6) is tail.\n> \n> Then on turn 58, I can move the head to some direction, but if I move without eating, the tail moves away, freeing (4,6), but head is not on it, so (4,6) is free, and I can move to it on turn 59 to eat.\n> \n> On turn 58, after moving, (4,6) is free, countdown for (4,6) at turn 59 is 1 (since at start of turn 59, countdown 1), so on turn 59, I can move head to (4,6) to eat it.\n> \n> But I need to have the head able to move to (4,6) on turn 59.\n> \n> Similarly, for the other food at (1,1), I can go for that.\n> \n> But first, let's go back to turn 55 decision.\n> \n> If I move L to (3,3) at turn 55.\n> \n> From (4,3) to (3,3), last move L, so new head (3,3), body (4,3), (5,3), etc., tail (2,5) removed, new tail (2,6).\n> \n> Positions: head (3,3), body (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6).\n> \n> Food at (4,3) is now under body at (4,3).\n> \n> From (3,3), possible moves: U, D, L, R.\n> \n> Last move L (from (4,3) to (3,3)), so cannot move R (right, reverse).\n> \n> U to (3,4), but (3,4) is internal wall, so cannot.\n> \n> D to (3,2), not wall, not snake, free.\n> \n> L to (2,3), not wall, free.\n> \n> R not allowed.\n> \n> So can go D to (3,2) or L to (2,3).\n> \n> Now, the food at (1,1) is at (1,1), which is free, and I can try to go for it.\n> \n> Also, there is a risk near the tail.\n> \n> Tail is at (2,6), and head at (3,3), not adjacent.\n> \n> But if I move towards (1,1), I might eat it.\n> \n> (1,1) has life span 7, so plenty of time.\n> \n> But let's think about the grid and obstacles.\n> \n> Internal walls at (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), so at x=1, y=2,4,5 are walls, so y=1,3,6,7 are free at x=1, but y=7 border, so (1,1), (1,3), (1,6) free, but (1,6) might be border or not, y=6, y=7 border, so (1,6) free.\n> \n> y=0 and y=7 walls, so y=1 to 6 are free except walls.\n> \n> At x=1, walls at (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), so free cells at (1,1), (1,3), (1,6).\n> \n> (1,6) is free, but snake has (2,6), so occupied.\n> \n> To reach (1,1), I can go from (3,3) to (2,3) or (3,2), then to (1,1).\n> \n> For example, from (3,3) go L to (2,3), then from (2,3) can go L to (1,3), then from (1,3) go D to (1,2), but (1,2) is wall, so cannot.

It's turn 57, and the grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so coordinates range from (0,0) to (7,7). Internal obstacles are given: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1). Snake positions: head is at (2,3), and the body goes to (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6). So the snake is 11 segments long. Head direction is L, which means left, so it's moving west, towards decreasing x.\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (4,6) with value 1 and life span 3. But (4,6) is part of the snake body; it's the 10th segment in the list, index 9 if we start from head. Snake positions: index 0: (2,3) head, 1: (3,3), 2: (4,3), 3: (5,3), 4: (6,3), 5: (6,4), 6: (6,5), 7: (6,6), 8: (5,6), 9: (4,6), 10: (3,6). So (4,6) is occupied by the snake body at position (4,6) which is index 9.\n> \n> But the food is at (4,6) with life span 3.

Walls are borders, so x=0 and x=7 are walls, y=0 and y=7 walls.\n> \n> x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x=1 to x=6 are within bounds? x=0 and x=7 are walls, so cells from x=1 to x=6, y=1 to y=6?

Cannot reverse (D is forbidden). \n   - U: (2, 5) \n     - Check: Not a wall or body. Free.\n   - L: (1, 4) \n     - Check: Internal obstacle. Invalid.\n   - R: (3, 4) \n     - Check: Internal obstacle. Invalid.\n   - D: (2, 3) \n     - Check: Body segment and reverse. Invalid.\n\n2. **Only Valid Move**: U to (2, 5). \n\n### Reasoning:\n- The food at (4, 6) is under the tail. To eat it, the tail must move away first, but the life span is too short (disappears after Turn 59). It is impossible to reach it in time from the current position.\n- Other foods are either under the body or too far to reach immediately.\n- The only safe and valid move is U to (2, 5). \n\n### Conclusion:\nThe immediate action for Turn 58 is to move up. \n\n\\boxed{U}",

It's turn 58. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and internal obstacles at (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1). So, I should sketch this grid to visualize.\n> \n> The grid is from (0,0) to (7,7). Walls on the borders, so cells like (0,y), (7,y), (x,0), (x,7) are all walls. Internal obstacles are given, so those cells are blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (2,4), then body segments: (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6). The head is at (2,4) and direction is U, which is up, so moving towards increasing y.\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (4,6) with value 1, life span 2\n> \n> - (1,1) with value 1, life span 4\n> \n> - (4,3) with value 1, life span 7\n> \n> - (6,6) with value 1, life span 10\n> \n> All food has value +1, since it says positive food with reward +1. Negative food isn't mentioned here, so all are positive.\n> \n> Life span: for (4,6), life span 2, meaning it disappears after 2 turns, including current turn. So on turn 58, life span 2, so it will be gone by turn 60? Let's clarify life span decrease.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So for food at (4,6) with life span 2 on turn 58: on turn 58, countdown is 2. After turn 58, it decreases to 1. After turn 59, it decreases to 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten on turn 58 or 59, but not after.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,1) life span 4: available for turns 58,59,60,61.\n> \n> (4,3) life span 7: available longer.\n> \n> (6,6) life span 10: available for many turns.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (2,4), direction U.

So all cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1)\n> \n> So blocked cells: walls and obstacles.\n> \n> Now, snake body: positions from head to tail: (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6)\n> \n> Head at (2,4), tail at (4,6).\n> \n> Food at (4,6) — but (4,6) is occupied by the snake's tail segment. According to the rules, food can spawn under the body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and then head moves onto it.\n> \n> Specifically: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> Also, \"Tail Reward Danger\": If head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and newly grown tail collide.\n> \n> In this case, food is at (4,6), which is the tail position. Snake tail is at (4,6), and food is there.\n> \n> Head is at (2,4). Is head adjacent to tail? Adjacent means sharing an edge, so up, down, left, right.\n> \n> (2,4) to (4,6): difference in x is 2, y is 2, so not adjacent; it's diagonal, not adjacent. Adjacent cells are those with |dx| + |dy| = 1.\n> \n> So (2,4) adjacent cells: (2,5), (2,3), (1,4), (3,4)\n> \n> (4,6) adjacent cells: (4,5), (4,7) but y=7 is wall, (3,6), (5,6), (5,6) is part of snake body? Snake positions: (6,6), (5,6), (4,6) so (5,6) is body segment before tail.\n> \n> But head at (2,4) is not adjacent to tail at (4,6). Distance is |2-4| + |4-6| = 2 + 2 = 4, not 1. So no immediate danger.\n> \n> To eat the food at (4,6), we need the tail to move away first, then head move to (4,6).\n> \n> Currently, tail is at (4,6). When snake moves, the tail will move depending on the direction.\n> \n> Snake movement: each turn, head moves to a new cell, and tail moves forward if not eating, or stays if eating and growing.\n> \n> But when eating, snake grows, so tail doesn't move; new tail is added.\n> \n> Standard snake: when head eats food, a new segment is added at the tail position, so tail stays, and snake length increases.\n> \n> But here, for food under body: if food is under tail, when tail moves away, the food is exposed, then head can move to it.\n> \n> In this case, food at (4,6) is under tail. So if the snake moves such that tail leaves (4,6), then the food is revealed, and head can later move to (4,6) to eat it.\n> \n> But life span is 2, so it must be eaten soon.\n> \n> Turn 58: life span 2, so available on turn 58 and 59.\n> \n> After turn 59, it disappears.\n> \n> Now, current turn 58, head at (2,4), direction U.\n> \n> Possible moves: U, D, L, R, but cannot reverse direction instantly. Current direction U, so cannot go D (down), because that would be reverse.\n> \n> Reverse of U is D.\n> \n> So allowed moves: U (up, y+1), L (left, x-1), R (right, x+1).

Positions: (4,3) is the fourth segment? Snake: (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), ... so (4,3) is a body segment.\n> \n> Food at (4,3) with life span 7. But it's under the body, so to eat it, we need the body to move away.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (6,6): (6,6) is snake body position, eighth segment? Positions: (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6) so (6,6) is occupied.\n> \n> Food at (6,6) with life span 10.\n> \n> And food at (1,1) which is free, life span 4.\n> \n> And food at (4,6) under tail, life span 2.\n> \n> Now, life span: (4,6) must be eaten by turn 59, since life span 2 on turn 58: after turn 58, life span 1; after turn 59, life span 0, gone.\n> \n> Similarly, others have more time.\n> \n> But to eat (4,6), we need tail to move away.\n> \n> Tail is at (4,6). When snake moves, if it doesn't eat food, tail moves forward.\n> \n> Currently, tail is at (4,6), and the segment before is (5,6).\n> \n> The snake is: positions: head (2,4), then (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), tail (4,6)\n> \n> So the tail is at (4,6), and the second last is (5,6).\n> \n> When snake moves, if it doesn't eat, head moves to new position, and tail moves to the next segment, so tail would leave (4,6) and move towards the body direction.\n> \n> The body is from (6,6) to (5,6) to (4,6), so it's like the tail is moving left from (5,6) to (4,6)? Positions: (6,6), then (5,6), then (4,6), so the direction is from (6,6) to (5,6) to (4,6), so moving left (decreasing x).\n> \n> But when snake moves, the tail segment will be removed if no growth.\n> \n> So on turn 58, if we move to (2,5), and don't eat food, then new head is (2,5), and tail moves forward: the tail was at (4,6), and since no growth, tail is removed, so new tail is (5,6), and the segment at (4,6) is freed.\n> \n> But food is at (4,6), so when tail moves away, food is revealed.\n> \n> Then on subsequent turns, we can move head to (4,6) to eat it.\n> \n> But life span is short.\n> \n> First, on turn 58, we must move U to (2,5), as only choice.\n> \n> Then after that, head at (2,5), direction U.\n> \n> Now, possible moves from (2,5): U, D, L, R, but cannot reverse down.\n> \n> Current direction U, so cannot D.\n> \n> Now, (2,5) to U: (2,6)\n> \n> (2,6): not border, not obstacle?

No collision with wall or body? Body: snake segments are all listed, (2,6) not in positions, so no body collision. Wall not there. So U is possible.\n> \n> Move L to (1,5): x=1,y=5. Borders: x=1 not 0 or 7, y=5 not 0 or 7. Internal obstacles: (1,5) is in the list! (1,5) is an internal obstacle, so wall. Cannot move there.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: [(5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1)]\n> \n> So (1,5) is wall, so moving left to (1,5) is invalid, collision.\n> \n> Move R to (3,5): (3,5) is not in walls, not in snake positions? Snake at (3,3) but not (3,5), and no food at (3,5), so should be free. Walls: x=3 not border, y=5 not border, internal obstacles: (3,4) is wall, but (3,5) is different. (3,4) is wall, but (3,5) not listed, so should be free. Snake positions: no (3,5), so R to (3,5) possible.\n> \n> D is forbidden since opposite direction.\n> \n> So possible actions: U to (2,6), R to (3,5), and L is invalid.\n> \n> But L to (1,5) is wall, so only U and R possible? What about staying? No, must move one cell in U, D, L, R, but D forbidden, L wall, so only U or R.\n> \n> U to (2,6) or R to (3,5).\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> First, let's see the food.\n> \n> (4,6) has life span 1, must be eaten this turn or gone. But (4,6) is at x=4,y=6. Head at (2,5), so not adjacent. To eat (4,6) on this turn, head must move to (4,6), but it's two steps away, impossible in one move. So cannot eat (4,6) this turn, it will disappear after this turn.\n> \n> (4,6) life span 1, turn 59, so if not eaten on turn 59, it disappears. Head at (2,5), cannot reach (4,6) in one move, so it will disappear, no point considering.\n> \n> Now, other food: (1,1) at (1,1), life span 3, so can be eaten on turn 59,60,61.\n> \n> (4,3) at (4,3), but occupied by snake body segment 4: (4,3). So to eat it, body must move away, then head move there.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,6) at (6,6), occupied by segment 9: (6,6), so same issue.\n> \n> Snake head at (2,5), if I move U to (2,6), or R to (3,5).\n> \n> Let me sketch the grid for better visualization.\n> \n> Grid 8x8, cells (0,0) to (7,7). y from 0 to 7, I assume y=0 bottom, y=7 top, but in coordinates, it might not matter, but for movement, U is y+1, D y-1.\n> \n> Walls:\n> \n> Borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls.\n> \n> Internal: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1)\n> \n> Snake: head (2,5), body: (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), tail (5,6)\n> \n> Food: (4,6), (1,1), (4,3), (6,6)\n> \n> (4,3) and (6,6) are occupied by body, so not accessible yet.\n> \n> (4,6) is free?

Snake positions: after move, head to new position, body follows.\n> \n> After moving U to (2,6), new positions: head (2,6), then previous head (2,5) becomes segment, so snake becomes: [(2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6)] but tail was (5,6), so when head moves, the tail moves away from (5,6) to the next? Standard snake movement: head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment in front, so tail moves off its position.\n> \n> Specifically, after moving head to (2,6), the segments: segment 1 (previously (2,4)) moves to (2,5), segment 2 ( (2,3) ) moves to (2,4), segment 3 ( (3,3) ) moves to (2,3), and so on, up to segment 10 ( (6,6) ) moves to (6,5)?

Walls include the borders and internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1).\n> \n> Snake positions: Head is at (3,6), and the body segments follow: (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5). So the tail is at (6,5). Snake length is 11 segments.\n> \n> Head direction is right (R), meaning it was moving right to get to (3,6) from (2,6). Since (2,6) is to the left, and head is at (3,6), moving right makes sense.\n> \n> Now, food items:\n> \n> - (1,1) with value 1, life span 2 (so it disappears after turn 62? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 61, life span 2 means it has 2 turns left, including this one. So it will be gone after turn 62.\n> \n> Life span: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So for food at (1,1) with life span 2 on turn 61, it will disappear after turn 62, meaning it's available on turn 61 and 62, gone on turn 63.\n> \n> Similarly:\n> \n> - (1,1): value 1, life span 2 (available turn 61 and 62)\n> \n> - (4,3): value 1, life span 4 (available turn 61,62,63,64, gone after 64)\n> \n> - (6,6): value 1, life span 7 (available for 7 turns from now)\n> \n> - (5,1): value 1, life span 10 (available for 10 turns)\n> \n> All food has value 1, so all positive food. No negative food mentioned, so all are good to eat, but I need to avoid risks.\n> \n> Special case: food can be under the snake body. Looking at food positions:\n> \n> - (4,3) is listed, but snake has a segment at (4,3) in the body. Positions: (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), etc. Yes, (4,3) is occupied by the snake body. So this food is under the body. To eat it, the body must move away, and then head must move onto it.\n> \n> Similarly, other foods: (1,1) is free, I think; (6,6) free; (5,1) free, but (5,1) is near a wall? Walls include (6,1), which is adjacent, but (5,1) itself not a wall.\n> \n> Walls: border x=0,7 y=0,7 and internal: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1).\n> \n> So (5,1) is at x=5,y=1; walls at x=0,7 y=0,7, so (5,1) is on the border? y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=1 is not border, but x=5,y=1 should be free unless internal wall.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (6,1) is a wall, but (5,1) is not listed, so it should be free.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,1) should be free, but let's see internal walls: (1,2), (1,4), (1,5) are walls, but (1,1) not listed, so free.\n> \n> (6,6) is at x=6,y=6; borders x=7,y=7, so not border; internal walls: (5,5), (6,1), but (6,6) not listed, so free.\n> \n> (4,3) is occupied by snake body.\n> \n> Now, head at (3,6), direction right.\n> \n> Possible moves: I can go U, D, L, R, but no instant reverse. Since head direction is R, I cannot go left (L) immediately, because that would be opposite.\n> \n> Current direction is R, so I cannot move L on this turn.\n> \n> Allowed moves: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), R (right, x+1). L is opposite, not allowed.\n> \n> So from (3,6):\n> \n> - U: (3,7) but y=7 is border wall, so (3,7) is wall, cannot move there.\n> \n> - D: (3,5) – is this free? Let's see walls and snake.\n> \n> Walls: internal walls include (3,4)? (3,4) is a wall? Internal obstacles: (3,4) is listed. Yes, (3,4) is a wall.\n> \n> (3,4) is a wall, so (3,5) – y=5, x=3. Walls: (3,4) is at y=4, so (3,5) should be free? (3,4) is a wall cell, so (3,5) is above it, not a wall unless specified.\n> \n> Internal obstacles are specific cells, so (3,4) is wall, but (3,5) is not listed as wall, and not border, so it should be free.\n> \n> Similarly, snake positions: head (3,6), then (2,6), (2,5), etc. (3,5) is not occupied by snake? Snake: (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5). So positions: x,y: (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5). So (3,5) is not occupied, so it should be free.\n> \n> Therefore, D to (3,5) is possible.\n> \n> R: (4,6) – what's here? Walls: x=4,y=6; not border, internal walls: (4,4) is wall, but (4,6) not listed, so free. Snake: (4,3) is body, but (4,6) not occupied, so free.\n> \n> L: but L is opposite to current direction R, so not allowed. Cannot move left.\n> \n> U: (3,7) is y=7 border wall, cannot.\n> \n> So possible moves from (3,6): D to (3,5) or R to (4,6).\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead, prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> Also, consider food.\n> \n> Foods:\n> \n> - (1,1): value 1, life span 2, so must be eaten by turn 62 or it's gone. Turn 61 now, so if not eaten now, only one more chance on turn 62.\n> \n> - (4,3): value 1, under snake body at (4,3), which is a body segment. To eat, need body to move away and head to move there. But (4,3) is occupied now, so I need to move such that the snake moves and (4,3) is vacated, then head can go there later. But life span 4, so it has until turn 64.\n> \n> - (6,6): value 1, life span 7, plenty of time.\n> \n> - (5,1): value 1, life span 10, also plenty.\n> \n> But (5,1) is near walls: (6,1) is wall, and (5,2) is wall? Internal walls: (5,2) is listed, yes, so (5,1) is at (5,1), surrounded? (5,1) has walls at (5,2) south? y=1, (5,2) is below? y=2.\n> \n> Coordinates: let's assume (x,y), with y increasing up? Movement: U is (x,y+1), so y increases up, I think.\n> \n> Standard: U (x,y+1) means up increases y.\n> \n> So grid: bottom-left (0,0), top-left (0,7), bottom-right (7,0), top-right (7,7).\n> \n> Head at (3,6), which is x=3,y=6, so near top.\n> \n> (5,1): x=5,y=1, near bottom.\n> \n> Walls: (5,2) is at (5,2), which is directly above (5,1)? y=2 is above y=1? Since y increases up, y=1 is below y=2.\n> \n> So (5,1) at y=1, (5,2) at y=2, so (5,2) is north of (5,1).\n> \n> Similarly, (6,1) is wall at (6,1).\n> \n> Also borders: y=0 is wall, so (5,1) is between y=0 and y=2 walls, but y=0 is wall, y=1 is not wall, but (5,1) is at y=1, so it's accessible, but to reach it, need to be careful.\n> \n> (5,1) can be accessed from left, right, or up? Up to (5,2) is wall, so cannot come from above. Down to (5,0) is y=0 wall, cannot. Left (4,1) or right (6,1) which is wall, so only from left or... (6,1) is wall, so cannot from right. (4,1) might be free, but need to check.\n> \n> (4,1) not wall, not snake? Snake is all above, so probably free.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,1) can only be accessed from left (4,1) or from below? But below is (5,0) wall, or above (5,2) wall, so only horizontally from (4,1) or (6,1) but (6,1) wall, so only from (4,1).\n> \n> (4,1) must be free to access (5,1).\n> \n> Similarly, (1,1) can be accessed, but there are walls around.\n> \n> First, let's list all free cells or something. But I should focus on possible paths.\n> \n> Back to current move: I can go to (3,5) or (4,6).\n> \n> (4,6) is to the right, (3,5) is down.\n> \n> Now, (4,6): what's there? Free, I think. Then from there, I can move.\n> \n> (3,5): free.\n> \n> Now, the food at (1,1) is urgent; it has life span 2, meaning if not eaten by turn 62, it disappears. Turn 61 now, so if I don't eat it this turn, I have only turn 62 to eat it.\n> \n> But (1,1) is far from (3,6). How to get there?\n> \n> From (3,6), if I go down to (3,5), or right to (4,6).\n> \n> To reach (1,1), I need to go left and down.\n> \n> But I cannot go left now because of direction.\n> \n> Also, the area around (1,1): walls at (1,2), (1,4), (1,5)? Internal walls: (1,2), (1,4), (1,5) are walls.\n> \n> (1,1) at (1,1), so above it (1,2) is wall, left x=0 wall, right (2,1) might be free, down (1,0) y=0 wall. So (1,1) can only be accessed from the right, from (2,1).\n> \n> (2,1) must be free to access (1,1).\n> \n> Now, (2,1) is not occupied by snake; snake is at (2,3) to (2,6) and others, but (2,1) is free, I think.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,2) might be wall? Walls: (1,2) is wall, but (2,2) not listed, so free.\n> \n> But to reach (2,1), I need to come from above or left/right, but left x=0 wall, so from above or right.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (3,6), to go to (1,1), it's a path, but with obstacles.\n> \n> For example, from (3,6) to (2,6) but (2,6) is body, cannot go there. Snake positions: (2,6) is the first body segment, so if I move, the snake will move, and tail moves, so cells become free.\n> \n> But for head movement, I cannot move to a cell occupied by body, except the tail, because tail will move.\n> \n> Collision: head touches any body segment except that if it's the tail and tail moves, it's ok, but only if I move into the tail cell and it moves away.\n> \n> Rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, if I move to a cell that will be vacated by the tail, it's safe.\n> \n> In this case, tail is at (6,5), so if I move to (6,5), it might be safe only if the tail moves away, but when I move head to a cell, the tail moves only after the head moves and body follows.\n> \n> Sequence: when head moves to a new cell, if it's food, snake grows, else, tail moves off.\n> \n> But collision: if head moves to a cell occupied by body, it collides, except if that cell is the current tail position, because after head moves there, tail moves away, so no collision.\n> \n> Specifically: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, moving to tail position is safe.\n> \n> Now, back to moves.\n> \n> Possible moves from (3,6):\n> \n> - D to (3,5): free cell, not body, not wall.\n> \n> - R to (4,6): free cell.\n> \n> L not allowed, U wall.\n> \n> Now, if I go D to (3,5), then head at (3,5), direction down.\n> \n> Then from there, I can go U, D, L, R, but no reverse, so since I came from up? From (3,6) to (3,5), moving down, so direction D. Then next move, cannot go U (opposite).\n> \n> Similarly, if I go R to (4,6), direction R, then cannot go L.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan for food.\n> \n> Food at (1,1) with short life.\n> \n> If I want to eat (1,1) on turn 62, I need to be adjacent to it on turn 62.\n> \n> (1,1) can only be accessed from (2,1), so I need to be at (2,1) on turn 62 to eat it by moving left.\n> \n> But turn 62 is next turn.\n> \n> Currently turn 61, head at (3,6).\n> \n> To be at (2,1) on turn 62, I need to move from (3,6) to (2,1) in one move, impossible. Distance is too far.\n> \n> From (3,6) to (2,1) is |3-2| + |6-1| = 1 + 5 = 6 steps, so I need at least 6 moves, but I have only this turn and next to eat it, since life span 2: available turn 61 and 62.\n> \n> On turn 61, I am at (3,6), not at (1,1), so I can't eat it now.\n> \n> On turn 62, I need to move to (1,1) to eat it.\n> \n> But to move to (1,1) on turn 62, I need to be at an adjacent cell on turn 61, like (2,1) or (1,0) but (1,0) wall, or (0,1) wall, or (1,2) wall, so only possible from (2,1).\n> \n> So on turn 61, I must be at (2,1) to move to (1,1) on turn 62.\n> \n> But on turn 61, I am at (3,6), which is not (2,1), and I can't reach (2,1) in one move. From (3,6) to (2,1) is not adjacent; adjacent cells are (3,5), (3,7) wall, (4,6), (2,6).\n> \n> (2,6) is occupied by snake body, so I can't move there unless it's tail, but (2,6) is not tail; tail is (6,5).\n> \n> (2,6) is the second segment, so if I move to (2,6), it would collide with body.\n> \n> Therefore, I cannot be at (2,1) on turn 61, so I cannot eat (1,1) on turn 62 either. Therefore, (1,1) cannot be eaten; it will disappear after turn 62 without being eaten.\n> \n> Life span 2 on turn 61: present on turn 61 and 62, gone on 63. Since I can't reach it by turn 62, it will be lost. So I should ignore this food for now.\n> \n> Not worth risking for food I can't reach.\n> \n> Similarly, other foods.\n> \n> Now, food at (4,3): under snake body at (4,3). To eat it, I need the snake to move so that (4,3) is vacated, then head moves there.\n> \n> Currently, (4,3) is occupied by a body segment. When the snake moves, if I don't eat food, the tail moves, so cells can be vacated.\n> \n> Snake positions: head (3,6), then segments: (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5)\n> \n> Tail is (6,5).\n> \n> If I move the head, the body follows.\n> \n> For example, if I move head to (3,5), then new head (3,5), then the segment that was at (2,6) moves to (3,6)? Let's see the new positions.\n> \n> After move to (3,5): head moves to (3,5), then the body: the first segment moves to previous head position (3,6), so (2,6) moves to (3,6), then (2,5) moves to (2,6), (2,4) to (2,5), (2,3) to (2,4), (3,3) to (2,3)? Positions: the body segments shift: the segment at index 1 moves to where head was, index 2 moves to where index 1 was, and so on.\n> \n> After head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> So if head moves to (3,5), then:\n> \n> - Head: (3,5)\n> \n> - Body[0]: was at (2,6), now moves to where head was, (3,6)\n> \n> - Body[1]: was at (2,5), now moves to where body[0] was, (2,6)\n> \n> - Body[2]: was at (2,4), now to (2,5)\n> \n> - Body[3]: was at (2,3), now to (2,4)\n> \n> - Body[4]: was at (3,3), now to (2,3)\n> \n> - Body[5]: was at (4,3), now to (3,3)\n> \n> - Body[6]: was at (5,3), now to (4,3)\n> \n> - Body[7]: was at (6,3), now to (5,3)\n> \n> - Body[8]: was at (6,4), now to (6,3)\n> \n> - Body[9]: was at (6,5), now to (6,4)\n> \n> - And tail was body[9] at (6,5), but since no food eaten, tail moves off, so new tail is at (6,4)? After movement, the last segment is at (6,4), and (6,5) is vacated.\n> \n> Similarly, the cell (4,3) was occupied by body[5], which is now moving to (3,3), so (4,3) is vacated, but there is food there? Food at (4,3) with value 1.\n> \n> After this move, (4,3) is free, and food is still there, since life span decreases but not eaten.\n> \n> Then, if I can move head to (4,3) next, I can eat it.\n> \n> But head is at (3,5) after first move.\n> \n> From (3,5), I can go to (4,3)? Not directly, (4,3) is not adjacent to (3,5). Adjacent cells: (3,6), (3,4), (2,5), (4,5).\n> \n> (3,6) is now occupied by the first body segment after move.\n> \n> (3,4) is wall, as (3,4) is internal obstacle.\n> \n> (2,5): let's see, after move, (2,5) is occupied by body? After move to (3,5), positions: head (3,5), body: (3,6), (2,6), (2,5)?

It's turn 62, and the grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, meaning coordinates from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls occupy the borders, so playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6) I think? Let me confirm.\n> \n> Walls: border cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So any cell with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 is a wall. Also, internal obstacles: [(5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1)]. So these cells are blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (4,6), then body: (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4). And head direction is R, meaning right.\n> \n> Food: there are four food items:\n> \n> - (1,1) with value 1, life span 1\n> \n> - (4,3) with value 1, life span 3? Wait, the format is (x, y, life_span, value)? Let's see: \" (1, 1, 1, 1) \" – I think it's (x, y, life_span, value). Similarly, (4, 3, 3, 1) so x=4,y=3, life_span=3, value=1. But value=1 for all, I think? (1,1,1,1), (4,3,3,1), (6,6,6,1), (5,1,9,1). All have value=1, so all are positive food? But one has value=1, which is positive. The rules say positive food has +1, negative has -1, but here all values are 1, so all positive? Let me check.\n> \n> Food positions: (1,1,1,1) – this might be (x,y, life_span, value) and value=1, so positive. Similarly, (4,3,3,1) value=1, (6,6,6,1) value=1, (5,1,9,1) value=1. So all food is positive with +1 reward and length increase. No negative food here.\n> \n> Life span: (1,1) has life span 1, meaning it disappears after this turn? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 62, life span 1 means it will disappear after this turn, so if not eaten now, it's gone.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,3) has life span 3, so it will disappear after 3 more turns, including turn 62? Let's clarify life span.\n> \n> From rules: \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So for a food with life span N at turn t, it will be gone after turn t + N - 1? Let's think.\n> \n> If countdown decreases every turn including current, at turn t, life span is N, then at turn t, after the turn, countdown becomes N-1. If countdown reaches 0, it disappears.\n> \n> Standard way: at the start of turn t, if life span is L, it decreases to L-1 at end of turn, and if L-1=0, it disappears.\n> \n> But for eating, if head moves onto it during the turn, it's eaten before disappearance.\n> \n> In this context, for (1,1,1,1): at turn 62, life span is 1. After turn 62, it will disappear, so it must be eaten on turn 62 or it's gone.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,3,3,1): life span 3 at turn 62, so after turn 62, it becomes 2, then 1, then 0 after turn 64, so disappears after turn 64? Let's define turns.\n> \n> Turn t: current turn, life span L.\n> \n> After turn t, life span becomes L-1.\n> \n> If L-1 = 0, food disappears.\n> \n> If L-1 > 0, it remains with life span L-1.\n> \n> So for (1,1,1,1): L=1 at turn 62. After turn 62, it becomes 0, so disappears. Must be eaten on turn 62.\n> \n> For (4,3,3,1): L=3 at turn 62. After turn 62, L=2; after turn 63, L=1; after turn 64, L=0, disappears. So available until turn 64 inclusive? Can be eaten on turns 62,63,64.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,6,6,1): L=6, available for 6 turns from 62 to 67? After turn 62, L=5; ... after turn 67, L=0, disappear. So available turns: 62 to 67.\n> \n> (5,1,9,1): L=9, available for many turns.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (4,6), direction R (right). So current position: (4,6)\n> \n> Possible moves: since direction is R, can move R, U, D, but not L (opposite, instant reverse not allowed).\n> \n> Current head direction R, so cannot move L to (3,6) because that would be left, opposite to right.\n> \n> Possible moves from (4,6):\n> \n> - Right: (5,6)\n> \n> - Up: (4,7) but y=7 is wall, since border y=7 is wall. So (4,7) is invalid.\n> \n> - Down: (4,5)\n> \n> - Left: (3,6) but that's opposite to current direction R, so not allowed.\n> \n> So only possible moves: Right to (5,6) or Down to (4,5).\n> \n> Now, need to think 5+ turns ahead, maximize score, avoid risks.\n> \n> First, let's map the grid.\n> \n> Grid size: walls at x=0,7 y=0,7, so cells from (1,1) to (6,6) are playable, but with internal obstacles.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1)\n> \n> List: (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), (3,4), (4,4), (5,2), (5,5), (6,1)\n> \n> Snake positions: head (4,6), then (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4)\n> \n> So snake length: 11 segments.

(5,6) to (6,6) is right, so can move to (6,6) next turn.\n> \n> (6,6) has food, value 1, positive.\n> \n> But need to check if it's safe.\n> \n> If move to (6,6) on turn 63, head to (6,6), eat food, so snake grows, new tail added, so positions: head (6,6), then (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), and since ate food, tail not removed, so new segment at old tail position? When eat food, head moves to food, food consumed, and a new segment is added at the tail position, so tail stays.\n> \n> After eating, snake length increases by one.\n> \n> So from current 11 segments, after eating, 12 segments.\n> \n> In this case, if on turn 63, from (5,6) move R to (6,6), eat food, so new head (6,6), body: previous head (5,6) becomes segment 1, and so on, up to previous tail (6,3) becomes segment 11, and new segment added at (6,3)? Standard: when you eat, the tail doesn't move, so new tail is the old tail, and a new segment is added.\n> \n> Positions: after move to (6,6), head is (6,6), then the previous positions: previous head (5,6) becomes first body segment, previous seg1 (4,6) becomes second, ..., previous seg10 (6,3) becomes eleventh body segment, and since food eaten, a new segment is added at the position of the previous tail, which was (6,3), so new segment at (6,3), but (6,3) is already the position of previous seg10, which is now seg11? Let's index.\n> \n> Before move to (6,6): positions at turn 63 start: head (5,6), seg1 (4,6), seg2 (3,6), seg3 (2,6), seg4 (2,5), seg5 (2,4), seg6 (2,3), seg7 (3,3), seg8 (4,3), seg9 (5,3), seg10 (6,3)\n> \n> After move R to (6,6): head moves to (6,6), which has food, so consumed. New head: (6,6)\n> \n> Then body: each segment moves to previous position: so seg1 becomes (5,6), seg2 becomes (4,6), seg3 becomes (3,6), seg4 becomes (2,6), seg5 becomes (2,5), seg6 becomes (2,4), seg7 becomes (2,3), seg8 becomes (3,3), seg9 becomes (4,3), seg10 becomes (5,3)\n> \n> And since food eaten, a new segment is added at the previous tail position, which was (6,3), so new segment at (6,3). But (6,3) is now occupied by the new segment.\n> \n> So new positions: head (6,6), then (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3)\n> \n> Now, head at (6,6), which is corner, surrounded? (6,6) has x=6, y=6. Possible moves: left to (5,6), down to (6,5), but y=5 is down? y decreases down? In coordinates, U: y+1, D: y-1, L: x-1, R: x+1.\n> \n> So from (6,6), possible moves:\n> \n> - U: (6,7) but y=7 wall, invalid\n> \n> - D: (6,5)\n> \n> - L: (5,6)\n> \n> - R: (7,6) but x=7 wall, invalid\n> \n> So can move D to (6,5) or L to (5,6)\n> \n> But (5,6) is now body segment, directly behind head? In positions, (5,6) is the first body segment, so if move L to (5,6), it would collide with body, die.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,5) is free? Let's see.\n> \n> (6,5): not wall, not obstacle? Internal obstacles: (6,1) is obstacle, but (6,5) not listed, so free. Snake positions: in new list, (6,5) not occupied, so free.\n> \n> So from (6,6), can move D to (6,5) or L to (5,6) but (5,6) is body, so collision if move there. So only possible move is D to (6,5).\n> \n> Then after that, head at (6,5), and so on.\n> \n> But at (6,6), if we move, we can only go down to (6,5), which might be ok, but we are in a corner.\n> \n> Now, back to turn 62 choice.\n> \n> If on turn 62 we move R to (5,6), then on turn 63 we can move to (6,6) to eat food, but after that, we are stuck at (6,6) with only one move down to (6,5).\n> \n> From (6,5), we can move to where?\n> \n> (6,5): moves possible: U to (6,6) but that is body now, or D to (6,4), L to (5,5), R invalid (x=7 wall).\n> \n> (6,6) is body, so U invalid. R invalid. D to (6,4): (6,4) was tail or something, but after eating, positions include (6,3) and (5,3) etc., (6,4) is free? After eating at (6,6), positions are (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3) — so (6,4) not occupied, and not obstacle, so free.\n> \n> L to (5,5): (5,5) is internal obstacle, blocked.\n> \n> So from (6,5), can move D to (6,4) or U to (6,6) but (6,6) occupied, invalid, so only D to (6,4).\n> \n> Then to (6,4), then from there, moves: U to (6,5), D to (6,3) but (6,3) is body, L to (5,4), R invalid.\n> \n> (6,3) is body, so D invalid. U to (6,5) is body? From (6,4), U to (6,5) — (6,5) was previous position, but after moving to (6,4), let's see the sequence.\n> \n> After turn 63: at (6,6)\n> \n> Turn 64: move D to (6,5), head to (6,5), body shifts: head (6,5), then (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), ..., down to (6,3) or something.\n> \n> Positions: before turn 64, at start of turn 64: head (6,6), body (5,6), (4,6), ..., (6,3)\n> \n> Move D to (6,5): (6,5) free, so move, no food? (6,5) no food, so just move, tail removed? New head (6,5), body: (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3) — and (6,3) removed since no food. Tail was (6,3), removed.\n> \n> So positions: head (6,5), then (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3)\n> \n> (6,3) removed.\n> \n> Now from (6,5), move to (6,4) on turn 65? But we are at (6,5) after turn 64.\n> \n> From (6,5), moves: U to (6,6) occupied, D to (6,4) free, L to (5,5) obstacle, R invalid. So only D to (6,4).\n> \n> Turn 65: move D to (6,4), head to (6,4), no food, body shifts: head (6,4), then (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3) — and (5,3) removed? Segments: previous head (6,5) to seg1, (6,6) to seg2, (5,6) to seg3, ..., up to (4,3) to seg11? Let's count.\n> \n> Before move: head (6,5), seg1 (6,6), seg2 (5,6), seg3 (4,6), seg4 (3,6), seg5 (2,6), seg6 (2,5), seg7 (2,4), seg8 (2,3), seg9 (3,3), seg10 (4,3), seg11 (5,3) — 12 segments? After eating at turn 63, snake has 12 segments.\n> \n> Turn 64 start: positions as above, 12 segments.\n> \n> After move to (6,4) no food: new head (6,4), then seg1 (6,5), seg2 (6,6), seg3 (5,6), seg4 (4,6), seg5 (3,6), seg6 (2,6), seg7 (2,5), seg8 (2,4), seg9 (2,3), seg10 (3,3), seg11 (4,3) — and (5,3) removed. So now 11 segments, tail at (4,3).\n> \n> But (4,3) has food? Food at (4,3) with life span, but we are at turn 65, life span was 3 at turn 62, so at turn 62 L=3, turn 63 L=2, turn 64 L=1, turn 65 L=0, so after turn 64 it disappears, so on turn 65 no food at (4,3).\n> \n> Anyway, from (6,4), moves: U to (6,5) occupied, D to (6,3), L to (5,4), R invalid.\n> \n> (6,3) is free?

It's turn 63, and I'm the snake AI. I have to think at least 5 turns ahead to maximize my score while avoiding risks.\n> \n> The grid has walls: border cells where x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7 are walls, so the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6) since x and y go from 0 to 7, but borders are walls, so I can't go to x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Also, there are internal obstacles at: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1). So these cells are blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (5,6), then (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3). So the snake has 11 segments. Head direction is R, meaning it was moving right last turn, so from (4,6) to (5,6).\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (4,3) with value 1 and life span 3. But (4,3) is occupied by the snake's body! It's the 9th segment in the list: positions are (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3). So (4,3) is the 9th position, which is part of the body. But according to the rules, food can spawn under the body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and then the head moves onto it.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,6) with value 1 and life span 5.\n> \n> And (5,1) with value 1 and life span 8.\n> \n> All food has value 1, so positive food, but I need to be careful with the one under the body.\n> \n> Now, life span: for (4,3), life span 3, meaning it disappears after 3 turns, including current turn. So on turn 63, life span is 3, so it will disappear after turn 65? Let's see: countdown decreases every turn, including current. So on turn 63, life span 3, after turn 63 it becomes 2, after turn 64 it becomes 1, after turn 65 it becomes 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten on turns 63, 64, or 65 if available.\n> \n> But since it's under the body, I need to move the body away first.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,6) life span 5: disappears after turn 67? Turn 63:5, t64:4, t65:3, t66:2, t67:1, t68:0 disappear? After N turns, so if life span N on turn T, it disappears at the end of turn T + N - 1 or something? I need to be precise.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So, on the turn it's spawned, life_span is N, and after N turns, it's gone. For example, if spawned on turn T with life_span N, it exists from turn T to turn T + N - 1, and disappears at the start of turn T + N or something? The countdown decreases every turn including current, so on turn T, life_span = N, on turn T+1, it's N-1, ..., on turn T + (N-1), it's 1, and on turn T + N, it should be 0 and disappear before the turn starts or after? But for eating, it can be eaten on any turn when life_span >0 and head moves to it.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so on turn 63, for (4,3), life_span=3, so it has 3 turns left including this one. After turn 63, it will have 2 left, and so on. So it can be eaten on turns 63, 64, 65.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,6) life_span=5, can be eaten turns 63 to 67.\n> \n> (5,1) life_span=8, turns 63 to 70.\n> \n> Now, snake head is at (5,6), direction R, so last move was right to (5,6). Possible moves: U, D, L, R. But I cannot move opposite to current direction if it's an instant reverse. Current direction is R, so opposite is L. Since I just moved right to (5,6), I cannot move left to (4,6) because that would be immediate reverse, which is not allowed. The rule says: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\" So for turn 63, I cannot move L (left) because that would be opposite to R.\n> \n> So possible moves from (5,6): U (up to (5,7)? But y=7 is a border wall, so (5,7) is out of bounds, I can't go there. D (down to (5,5)), L (left to (4,6)), but (4,6) is the second segment of the snake, but according to movement constraints, I can move into the tail cell only if the tail moves away, but let's see.\n> \n> Collision rules: I die if head touches any body segment except that I can move into the cell occupied by the tail segment because the tail will move forward, so it's safe as long as I don't hit other body parts.\n> \n> In this case, from (5,6), possible moves:\n> \n> - U: (5,7) - but y=7 is border wall, so invalid, collision.\n> \n> - D: (5,5) - is this free? Let's see what's at (5,5). Snake positions: head (5,6), then (4,6), (3,6), etc., down to (6,3). (5,5) is not in the snake positions? Positions are: (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3). So (5,5) is not listed, so it should be empty. But there's an internal obstacle at (5,5)? Internal obstacles include (5,5)? List: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1). Yes, (5,5) is an internal obstacle, so wall, cannot move there.\n> \n> So D to (5,5) is invalid, wall.\n> \n> - L: (4,6) - this is the second segment of the snake, at position (4,6). Now, since it's not the tail, if I move there, head would touch body segment, which is deadly. Tail is at (6,3), which is the last segment. (4,6) is the neck, second position, so if I move left to (4,6), head would be on a body cell that is not the tail, so collision, die.\n> \n> - R: (6,6) - now (6,6) is within bounds? x=6, y=6. Border walls: x=0 and x=7 are walls, y=0 and y=7 are walls. So x=6 is not x=7, so (6,6) should be playable, but x=7 is wall, so x=6 is ok. Similarly y=6 ok. Is there an obstacle? Internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1). (6,6) is not listed, so it should be free. Also, food at (6,6) is present.\n> \n> But (6,6) has food, but let's see if I can move there.\n> \n> From (5,6), moving R to (6,6) is possible? But is (6,6) occupied? Snake positions don't include (6,6), only up to (6,3), so (6,6) is empty except for the food.\n> \n> So possible moves: only R to (6,6) seems valid? U is wall, D is wall (obstacle), L is body collision.\n> \n> L to (4,6): (4,6) is occupied by snake body, and it's not the tail, so yes, collision.\n> \n> R to (6,6): (6,6) is not occupied by snake or wall, and it has food, but I can move there.\n> \n> But let's confirm the direction. Head direction is R, so moving R is fine, not reverse.\n> \n> Also, no instant reverse issue since I'm not moving opposite.\n> \n> So only possible move is R to (6,6)? But is that the only option?\n> \n> What about other directions?

It's turn 64, and I'm playing Snake on a 7x7 grid since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think. Let me confirm the coordinates.\n> \n> The walls are border cells: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So yes, the grid is 1 to 6 in both x and y, with obstacles inside.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: [(5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1)]\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (6,6), then (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3). So the snake is 12 segments long.\n> \n> Head direction is R, which means it was moving right to get to (6,6). Since it came from (5,6) to (6,6), so previous move was right.\n> \n> Food:\n> \n> - (4,3) with value 1 and life span 2. This means it disappears after 2 turns, including current turn? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 64, life span 2 means it will disappear after turn 65? Let me think.\n> \n> Life span: \"Disappears after N turns\", and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So for food at (4,3) with life span 2 on turn 64:\n> \n> - Turn 64: life span 2 (countdown decreases to 1 after this turn? Or at the start?)\n> \n> The rule says: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So on turn t when it's present, countdown decreases. For example, if spawned on turn t with life span N, on turn t, countdown is N, then decreases each turn.\n> \n> But here, on turn 64, it's given with life span 2, so:\n> \n> - Turn 64: countdown = 2, decreases to 1 at the end of turn 64?\n> \n> I need to clarify the timing.\n> \n> Typically in such games, at the start of turn, the state is given, then you make a move, and after the move, things update.\n> \n> The rule: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" and \"disappears after N turns\".\n> \n> Also, \"can be eaten only if head moves onto it\".\n> \n> So for food at (4,3) on turn 64 with life span 2:\n> \n> - After turn 64, if not eaten, life span decreases to 1.\n> \n> - After turn 65, if not eaten, life span decreases to 0 and disappears.\n> \n> So it can be eaten on turn 64 or 65, but not after.\n> \n> Similarly, other food:\n> \n> - (5,1) value 1, life span 7\n> \n> - (6,2) value 1, life span 10\n> \n> All food has value 1, so positive food, no negative food here.\n> \n> Now, special case: food at (4,3) is on a body segment. Let's see snake positions: (4,3) is the 10th segment? Snake positions: head (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3). So (4,3) is occupied by the snake body, specifically the 10th segment.\n> \n> But food is at (4,3), which is under the body. To eat it, two conditions: body moves away, and head moves onto it.\n> \n> Since the body is at (4,3), and the snake moves, if the tail moves away from (4,3), and then head moves to (4,3), it can be eaten.\n> \n> But in this case, (4,3) is not the tail; tail is at (6,3).

But is (6,5) safe?\n> \n> Let's check the grid.\n> \n> Walls: border x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so cells (1,1) to (6,6) are playable? x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n> \n> (6,6) is top-right corner? y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=1 to y=6 are inside, similarly x=1 to x=6.\n> \n> So (6,6) is a corner.\n> \n> Head at (6,6), direction R.\n> \n> Moving:\n> \n> - U: (6,7) but y=7 is wall, so not possible.\n> \n> - D: (6,5) which is within bounds.\n> \n> - L: (5,6) but (5,6) is the second segment of snake, so if I move left to (5,6), head would collide with body, since (5,6) is occupied by snake body.\n> \n> Snake positions: [(6,6), (5,6), ...] so (5,6) is the first body segment, directly behind head. So moving to (5,6) would cause collision, as head touches body.\n> \n> - R: (7,6) x=7 wall, invalid.\n> \n> So only possible move is D to (6,5).\n> \n> But is (6,5) empty? Snake positions: let's list all occupied cells.\n> \n> Snake: (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3)\n> \n> So (6,5) is not in this list, so it should be empty.\n> \n> Also, obstacles: internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1)\n> \n> (6,5) is not an obstacle, so moving to (6,5) should be safe.\n> \n> But after moving, the snake will have a new head at (6,5), and tail will move from (6,3)?

After turn 65 it disappears.\n> \n> Turn 64: life span 2\n> \n> After turn 64, if not eaten, life span becomes 1\n> \n> After turn 65, if not eaten, life span 0, disappears.\n> \n> So it can be eaten on turn 64 or 65.\n> \n> But currently, (4,3) is under snake body, so to eat it, the body must move away, then head move to it.\n> \n> Similarly, other food at (5,1) and (6,2).\n> \n> (6,2) is near, but (6,1) is obstacle, so (6,2) might be accessible.\n> \n> First, on turn 64, I must move to (6,5) since it's the only choice.\n> \n> Is that right?

It's turn 65. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and internal obstacles at (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1).\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (6,5), then body segments: (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3). So the snake is 12 segments long.\n> \n> Head direction is down (D), which means from (6,5), moving down would be to (6,4), but let's confirm the coordinate system. Typically, in grids, y=0 might be top or bottom; here, since moving up increases y (U: (x,y+1)), and down decreases y (D: (x,y-1)), so y=0 is probably the bottom, and y=7 is top? No, let's see the state: snake head at (6,5), direction D. If D is down, y decreases, so from (6,5) down to (6,4).\n> \n> But in the food, we have positions like (4,3), which might be near the bottom if y=0 is bottom.\n> \n> Also, walls at y=0 and y=7, so y=0 and y=7 are boundaries.\n> \n> Now, food: three items:\n> \n> - (4,3) with value 1, life span 1 (so it disappears after this turn if not eaten? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 65, life span 1 means after this turn, it will be gone? Let me read the rule.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So for food at (4,3), life span 1 at turn 65. That means after turn 65, it disappears. So if not eaten on turn 65, it's gone.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,1) life span 6, so it will disappear after 6 more turns, meaning it can be eaten from turn 65 to 70 inclusive? Countdown decreases every turn including current.\n> \n> At turn t, life span L, it will disappear after L turns, so it can be eaten on turns t, t+1, ..., t+L-1? Let's clarify.\n> \n> Suppose at turn t, food has life span N. After turn t, countdown decreases to N-1. It disappears after N turns, meaning at the end of turn t + N, it is removed. So it can be eaten on any turn from t to t + N - 1 inclusive.\n> \n> For example, life span 1 at turn t: can be eaten only on turn t, disappears after turn t.\n> \n> Life span 2: can be eaten on turn t or t+1, disappears after turn t+1.\n> \n> Similarly here: for (4,3), life span 1 at turn 65, so must be eaten on this turn or it's gone.\n> \n> (5,1) life span 6, so can be eaten from turn 65 to 70.\n> \n> (6,2) life span 9, turn 65 to 73.\n> \n> All food has value +1, so all positive food, no negative food mentioned. Value 1 for all.\n> \n> Now, snake head is at (6,5), direction D (down). So from (6,5), moving down would go to (6,4).\n> \n> But let's see what cells are occupied.\n> \n> First, possible moves from head position (6,5):\n> \n> - Up: (6,6) but (6,6) is occupied by the snake body, second segment. But can we move there? Only if it's the tail and we can move into tail position because tail will move.\n> \n> Current snake positions: [(6,5) head, (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3)] so 12 segments.\n> \n> Tail is at (5,3).\n> \n> From head (6,5), possible directions:\n> \n> - U: to (6,6) - but (6,6) is occupied by body segment. Is it safe? In snake, moving into a cell that will be vacated by the tail is ok, but only if that cell is the tail position at the time of move.\n> \n> General rule: after moving, the head goes to a new position, and if it's not food, tail moves forward, so the cell that was tail is now free.\n> \n> But when head moves to a cell, if that cell is occupied by body, it collides, except if it's the tail cell at that moment.\n> \n> Specifically: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, for a move to be safe, the head must not move to a cell that is occupied by any body segment except the tail segment.\n> \n> If it moves to the tail segment, since tail moves away, it's ok, but only if no growth happens? When you eat food, you grow, so tail doesn't move.\n> \n> Important: when you eat food, the snake grows, so tail stays in place, meaning that if you move head to the tail position and eat food, you collide because the new tail is added there.\n> \n> Rule: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n> \n> But in general, moving to tail position is only safe if you don't eat food, because if you don't eat, tail moves, so the cell is free. If you eat, tail doesn't move, so head and tail are on same cell or adjacent? When you eat, head moves to food, which might be tail, and if tail has food, and you eat it, then since you grow, the tail doesn't move, so head is on the same cell as the old tail, which is now the new body, so collision.\n> \n> Standard snake: if head moves to a cell that is occupied by body, it dies, except if that cell is the current tail and you don't eat food, because tail moves away.\n> \n> But if you move to tail and eat food, then tail doesn't move, so head and tail are on same cell, which is collision.\n> \n> In this case, for moving to tail position:\n> \n> - If there is no food on that cell, and you move to it, then since you don't eat, tail moves forward, so it's safe; the head occupies the tail position, which becomes part of body, but since tail moved, it's fine.\n> \n> - If there is food on the tail cell, and you move to it to eat, then you grow, tail doesn't move, so head is now on the same cell as the tail was, but tail is still there? No: when you eat, the head moves to the food cell, which was occupied by tail, so at that moment, head and tail are on same cell? But in terms of positions, the tail segment is still there until after the move.\n> \n> I think I need to clarify the sequence.\n> \n> Typically in snake movement:\n> \n> 1. Head moves to a new cell.\n> \n> 2. If the new cell has food, the snake grows (tail doesn't move), and food is consumed.\n> \n> 3. If no food, tail moves forward (so the last segment is removed).\n> \n> So, when head moves to a cell:\n> \n> - If that cell is empty, and not body, then if no food, tail moves, all good.\n> \n> - If that cell has food, then grow, tail stays.\n> \n> - If that cell is occupied by body (except tail), collision.\n> \n> - If that cell is the tail position:\n> \n> - Case A: no food on tail cell: head moves to tail cell, since no food, tail moves forward, so tail cell is vacated, and head is now where tail was, but tail moved, so no collision.\n> \n> - Case B: food on tail cell: head moves to tail cell to eat food, so it grows, meaning tail does not move; so the head is now on the cell that was tail, and since tail doesn't move, that cell now has both head and tail? No, after eating, the tail segment remains, and a new segment is added at head, so the cell that was tail is now a body segment, and head is on it, so collision.\n> \n> Therefore, moving to the tail cell is only safe if there is no food on it, and you don't eat, so tail moves away.\n> \n> If there is food on tail cell and you eat it, it causes collision because the tail doesn't move.\n> \n> In this state, is there food on tail? Tail is at (5,3), and food at (4,3) and (5,1) and (6,2), so (5,3) has no food listed? Food positions: (4,3), (5,1), (6,2). (5,3) is not listed as food, so no food there.\n> \n> But (4,3) is food, which is occupied by a body segment? Snake positions include (4,3), which is the 11th segment? Positions: index 0: head (6,5), 1: (6,6), 2: (5,6), 3: (4,6), 4: (3,6), 5: (2,6), 6: (2,5), 7: (2,4), 8: (2,3), 9: (3,3), 10: (4,3), 11: (5,3) tail.\n> \n> So (4,3) is a body segment, and there is food at (4,3) with life span 1.\n> \n> Rule about food under body: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> So for food at (4,3), it's currently under the snake body (segment 10), so it can only be eaten if the snake moves such that body is no longer on (4,3), and then head moves to it.\n> \n> Similarly, other food: (5,1) and (6,2) are not under snake, I think.\n> \n> (5,1): is it occupied? Snake at (6,5), (6,6), etc., no (5,1), so free.\n> \n> (6,2): not in snake positions, so free.\n> \n> (4,3) is occupied, so food there can't be eaten until the snake moves off it.\n> \n> Now, back to possible moves from head (6,5).\n> \n> Direction D (down): to (6,4)\n> \n> Is (6,4) wall? Walls: border x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7, and internal obstacles.\n> \n> (6,4): x=6, y=4. Borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so (6,4) is within 1 to 6? x and y from 0 to 7, I think, since borders at 0 and 7.\n> \n> Grid size: walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so playable area x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? Let's see.\n> \n> x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x from 1 to 6 inclusive? Similarly y from 1 to 6? But y=0 and y=7 are walls.\n> \n> For example, (6,4): x=6, y=4. x=6 is not 0 or 7, y=4 not 0 or 7, so not border wall. Internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1). (6,4) not in list, so free.\n> \n> But is it occupied by snake? Snake positions: (6,5), (6,6), etc., no (6,4), so free.\n> \n> Moving down to (6,4) is possible.\n> \n> Next, direction L: left to (5,5)\n> \n> (5,5): internal obstacle? (5,5) is in internal obstacles list: (5,5), yes, so wall, cannot move there.\n> \n> Direction R: right to (7,5), but x=7 is border wall, so cannot move.\n> \n> Direction U: up to (6,6)\n> \n> (6,6) is occupied by snake body, second segment. Now, is it tail? Tail is at (5,3), not (6,6), so (6,6) is a body segment, not tail, so moving to it would cause collision.\n> \n> Therefore, from (6,5), with head direction D, possible moves:\n> \n> - U: (6,6) - body, collision\n> \n> - D: (6,4) - free, possible\n> \n> - L: (5,5) - wall, impossible\n> \n> - R: (7,5) - wall, impossible\n> \n> So only possible move is down to (6,4)? But what about the reverse move? Head direction is D (down), so moving up would be reverse, but rule says \"No instant reverse\": Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\n> \n> Current direction is D, so cannot move U, which is opposite. But U is to (6,6), which is body anyway, so not possible regardless.\n> \n> But D is possible, to (6,4).\n> \n> Is there any other direction? L and R are walls, so only D is possible? But let's confirm.\n> \n> Perhaps I missed something. Head at (6,5), only adjacent cells: up (6,6), down (6,4), left (5,5), right (7,5). Left (5,5) is obstacle, right is border wall, up is body and reverse, down is free. So only down is safe and possible.\n> \n> But the snake must move, so for turn 65, action should be D.\n> \n> But let's think ahead. Food at (4,3) has life span 1, so if not eaten this turn, it disappears. But it's under the snake body at (4,3), which is segment 10. To eat it, the body must move away, then head moves to it.\n> \n> But on this turn, body is on (4,3), so it can't be eaten now. Only after the body moves off.\n> \n> After moving, if we move down, head goes to (6,4), and the snake moves: since no food eaten (assuming (6,4) has no food), tail moves to (4,3)? After move, head at (6,4), body segments shift: the segment that was at (6,5) is now behind head, so positions become: head (6,4), then (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), and tail (5,3) moves off? When no food, tail moves, so the last segment (5,3) is removed, and the new tail is (4,3)? Let's list positions after move down.\n> \n> Current positions: indices 0: (6,5) head, 1: (6,6), 2: (5,6), 3: (4,6), 4: (3,6), 5: (2,6), 6: (2,5), 7: (2,4), 8: (2,3), 9: (3,3), 10: (4,3), 11: (5,3) tail.\n> \n> After move D to (6,4):\n> \n> - Head moves to (6,4)\n> \n> - Since no food at (6,4), tail is removed, so new positions: head (6,4), then body: [ (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3) ] and tail at (4,3)? Segments: the old body from index 1 to 11, but index 1 (6,6) becomes the segment after head, and so on, up to index 10 (4,3), and index 11 (5,3) is removed since tail moved.\n> \n> After move:\n> \n> - New head: (6,4)\n> \n> - Then the previous head (6,5) becomes first body segment.\n> \n> - Then (6,6) second body, (5,6) third, ..., up to (4,3) which was index 10, now it's the 11th body?

No: since no food, length doesn't increase, but tail moves, so one segment is added at head, one removed at tail.\n> \n> Original: 12 segments.\n> \n> After move: head moves to new cell (6,4), which was empty, so new head position.\n> \n> Then the body: the first body segment is the previous head position (6,5), then the next is the previous first body (6,6), and so on, up to the previous second last body, which was (4,3) index 10, and the tail (5,3) index 11 is not included, so new positions: head (6,4), body: (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), and tail (4,3)?

It's turn 66, and I'm the snake AI. My goal is to maximize score by eating positive food while avoiding risks, and I must think at least 5 turns ahead, prioritizing long-term survival.\n> \n> The grid has walls. Border cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the grid is 8x8 from (0,0) to (7,7). Internal obstacles are at: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1). I need to avoid these.\n> \n> Snake positions: Head is at (6,4), then body segments: (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3). So the snake is 12 segments long.\n> \n> Head direction is D, which is down, meaning it's moving downwards. Since it's moving down, the next position would be (x,y-1) if it continues, but since it's direction D, and it's at (6,4), moving down would go to (6,3).\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (5,1) with life span 6, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (6,2) with life span 8, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> Both foods are positive, so eating them gives +1 score and increases length by 1.\n> \n> Life span: For (5,1), life span 6 means it disappears after 6 turns, including this turn, so it has 6 turns left starting from turn 66. Similarly, (6,2) has 8 turns left.\n> \n> Now, head direction is D, so I can't move up instantly because that would be reverse. Possible moves: Since head is facing down, I can move down (continue), left, or right, but not up.\n> \n> Let me sketch the grid to visualize.\n> \n> Grid is 8x8, from (0,0) bottom-left to (7,7) top-right? Usually in such games, (0,0) is top-left or bottom-left? The state doesn't specify, but since head direction is D (down), and snake positions show head at (6,4) with body at (6,5) and (6,6), which have higher y, so if y increases upwards, then (6,6) is above (6,5), which is above (6,4), so head at (6,4) moving down to lower y, meaning y decreases as we go down. So probably (0,0) is bottom-left, y=0 bottom, y=7 top. x=0 left, x=7 right.\n> \n> Confirming: snake positions: head (6,4), then (6,5), (6,6) – so (6,6) has higher y, so if head is moving down from (6,4) to lower y, but current head is at (6,4), direction down, so next move could be to (6,3).\n> \n> Body segments: after head (6,4), then (6,5), (6,6), so (6,5) is above head? Head at (6,4), next body at (6,5), which has y=5 > 4, so y=5 is north of y=4 if y increases north.\n> \n> But direction is down, meaning decreasing y.\n> \n> So let's assume standard: x from left to right, y from bottom to top? Or top to bottom? In programming, often y=0 top, y increasing down, but here since head is at (6,4) and body at (6,5), and direction down, if y=5 is above, then down decreases y.\n> \n> To avoid confusion, let's define coordinates:\n> \n> Set (0,0) as bottom-left corner, so x right, y up. Then (6,4) is at x=6, y=4.\n> \n> Moving down: (x,y) to (x,y-1)\n> \n> Moving up: to (x,y+1)\n> \n> Left: (x-1,y)\n> \n> Right: (x+1,y)\n> \n> Now, head at (6,4), direction down, so last move was to (6,4) from above, which was (6,5)? Positions: snake positions list: [(6,4), (6,5), (6,6), ...] so head is first, so at turn 66, head is at (6,4), and it came from (6,5) since direction is down, so previous head was at (6,5) at turn 65, moved down to (6,4).\n> \n> Body segments: after head (6,4), the next is (6,5), which was the previous head position, then (6,6), (5,6), etc.\n> \n> For movement, from current head (6,4), I can move to adjacent cells except walls or reverse direction.\n> \n> Possible moves: since direction is down, I can move down (to (6,3)), left (to (5,4)), or right (to (7,4)), but not up to (6,5) because that's reverse and also occupied by body.\n> \n> But I can move to cells that are free.\n> \n> First, check adjacent cells:\n> \n> - Down: (6,3)\n> \n> - Left: (5,4)\n> \n> - Right: (7,4)\n> \n> - Up: (6,5) but this is body, and reverse, so invalid.\n> \n> Now, walls: border walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So x=7 is right border, so (7,4) is wall? x=7 is border, so (7,4) is a wall cell, cannot move there.\n> \n> Similarly, y=0 is bottom, so (6,3) is y=3, not wall yet.\n> \n> y=0 is bottom, so cells with y=0 or y=7 are walls, x=0 or x=7 are walls.\n> \n> So for (6,3): x=6, y=3, not border, so ok if not obstacle.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1)\n> \n> (6,1) is an obstacle, but (6,3) is not listed, so should be free.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,4): is it obstacle?

opportunities. This sequence ensures the snake moves away from risks while positioning it in open spaces for better maneuverability over the next 5+ turns.\n",

All other moves are blocked by walls or body segments.\n\n### Additional Notes:\n- The food at (3,6) is currently under the snake's body and cannot be eaten immediately. The snake must vacate (3,6) first and then return to eat it.\n- The foods at (5,1) and (6,2) are not immediately accessible without risking collision or dead ends, as analyzed in the Thinking Model's guidance.\n\n### Final Decision:\n\\boxed{D}",

It's turn 67, and I'm playing Snake on a 7x7 grid, since the borders are x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7. That means the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think? Let me confirm: x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x from 1 to 6, similarly y from 1 to 6. But let's check the coordinates.\n> \n> The grid has walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the cells are from (1,1) to (6,6). Internal obstacles are given: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1). I should list all obstacles to avoid.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (5,4), then (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3). So the snake has 12 segments. Head direction is left (L), meaning it was moving left to (5,4) from previous position. Since head is at (5,4) and previous was... positions are listed head first, so from head to tail: (5,4) head, then (6,4), which is right of head? Let's plot this.\n> \n> Grid is 6x6: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n> \n> Head: (5,4) moving left. So it came from (6,4)? Positions: [(5,4), (6,4), ...] so head is (5,4), next is (6,4), which is east of head? (5,4) and (6,4) are adjacent horizontally. Since head is at (5,4) and moving left, that means it was previously at (6,4) and moved left to (5,4). But in the list, (6,4) is the second segment, which is the neck. So current head position is (5,4), and it just moved left from (6,4) to (5,4). Now, for the next move, since it's moving left, I can't instantly reverse to right, so possible moves are up, down, or left, but not right.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (5,1) with life span 5, value +1\n> \n> - (6,2) with life span 7, value +1\n> \n> - (3,6) with life span 10, value +1? It says \"Value and Life Span\": (5,1,5,1) so (x,y,life_span,value). Value is 1, which is positive food.\n> \n> All food has value 1, so all are positive food? No negative food here.\n> \n> (3,6) is listed, but let's see where that is.\n> \n> Also, (3,6) is part of the snake body? Snake positions: (3,6) is the 7th segment? Positions: index 0: (5,4) head, 1: (6,4), 2: (6,5), 3: (6,6), 4: (5,6), 5: (4,6), 6: (3,6), 7: (2,6), etc.\n> \n> So (3,6) is occupied by the snake body, segment 6. But food is at (3,6) with life span 10, value 1.\n> \n> Food can spawn under the snake's body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves onto it.\n> \n> Currently, (3,6) has food and is occupied by snake body segment. So if the snake moves such that this cell is vacated and later head moves there, it can be eaten.\n> \n> Similarly, other food: (5,1) and (6,2) are not occupied, I think.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score and survival.\n> \n> First, let's map the grid.\n> \n> Grid cells: rows y=1 to 6, columns x=1 to 6.\n> \n> Walls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, so we can't go there.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1)\n> \n> List: (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), (3,4), (4,4), (5,2), (5,5), (6,1)\n> \n> Snake: head (5,4), body: (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3)\n> \n> So tail is at (3,3).\n> \n> Head direction L, so from (6,4) to (5,4), moving left.\n> \n> Possible moves from (5,4):\n> \n> - Up: (5,5) but (5,5) is an obstacle? Internal obstacles include (5,5), so (5,5) is a wall, cannot move there.\n> \n> - Down: (5,3) – is this free? Let's see what's at (5,3).\n> \n> Current snake positions: (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3)\n> \n> (5,3) is not in the list, and not an obstacle? Obstacles: (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), (3,4), (4,4), (5,2), (5,5), (6,1). (5,3) is not an obstacle, so it should be free.\n> \n> - Left: (4,4) but (4,4) is an internal obstacle? Obstacles include (4,4), yes, so cannot move left to (4,4).\n> \n> - Right: (6,4) but (6,4) is the neck, which is part of the body. But since the snake will move, when we move, the tail moves, so we can move to the tail cell if it's the only one, but here (6,4) is the second segment, not the tail.\n> \n> Collision rules: if head touches any body segment except the tail, it's a collision. But when moving, if you move to the cell that was the tail, and the tail moves away, it's ok, because the tail vacates.\n> \n> Specifically: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, from (5,4), possible moves:\n> \n> - Up: (5,5) – but (5,5) is an obstacle, wall, cannot move.\n> \n> - Down: (5,3) – no wall, not occupied by body except possibly tail, but tail is at (3,3), far away. (5,3) is empty, I think.\n> \n> - Left: (4,4) – obstacle, cannot move.\n> \n> - Right: (6,4) – (6,4) is currently occupied by the second segment. But after move, if I move right to (6,4), since the snake moves, the tail moves, so (6,4) will be occupied by head, and the body follows.\n> \n> When I move, the head moves to a new cell, and each segment moves to the next position, so the tail cell is vacated.\n> \n> If I move right to (6,4), which is currently the neck, after move, head moves to (6,4), and the segment that was at (6,4) moves to... let's see the positions.\n> \n> Current positions: index 0: (5,4) head, 1: (6,4), 2: (6,5), 3: (6,6), 4: (5,6), 5: (4,6), 6: (3,6), 7: (2,6), 8: (2,5), 9: (2,4), 10: (2,3), 11: (3,3) tail.\n> \n> If I move right to (6,4), new head position: (6,4). Then the body: segment 1 moves to where head was, (5,4), but since head moved to (6,4), segment 1 was at (6,4), which is now head, so segment 1 moves to (5,4)? Let's think.\n> \n> After move, new positions: head moves to new cell, then each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead.\n> \n> So, if head moves to (6,4), then:\n> \n> - New head: (6,4)\n> \n> - Segment 1 (was at (6,4)) moves to the previous head position? No.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: the head moves to a new cell, then each subsequent segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> So positions shift: new position 0: (6,4) for head\n> \n> Position 1: moves to where position 0 was, which is (5,4)\n> \n> Position 2: moves to where position 1 was, which is (6,4)? No.\n> \n> Let's list current positions:\n> \n> P0: (5,4)\n> \n> P1: (6,4)\n> \n> P2: (6,5)\n> \n> P3: (6,6)\n> \n> P4: (5,6)\n> \n> P5: (4,6)\n> \n> P6: (3,6)\n> \n> P7: (2,6)\n> \n> P8: (2,5)\n> \n> P9: (2,4)\n> \n> P10: (2,3)\n> \n> P11: (3,3) tail\n> \n> If head moves right to (6,4):\n> \n> - New head: (6,4)\n> \n> - Then P1 moves to old P0: (5,4)\n> \n> - P2 moves to old P1: (6,4)? But (6,4) is now head, and P2 was at (6,5), moves to where P1 was, which is (6,4), but (6,4) is occupied by new head? No, in terms of position, P2 moves to the cell that was occupied by P1, which is (6,4), but since head is moving there, it might be a collision.\n> \n> Collision: if the head moves to a cell that is occupied by any body segment except the tail, it collides.\n> \n> Here, moving to (6,4), which is currently occupied by P1, the neck. Since P1 is not the tail, moving there would cause head to collide with body, death.\n> \n> Similarly, if moving to a cell that will be occupied after move, but the rule is about the cell being occupied before move or after?\n> \n> The state is before move, so cells occupied by body are deadly except tail.\n> \n> \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, before move, the cells with body segments are deadly for head to move to, except the tail cell.\n> \n> Here, (6,4) has P1, which is not tail, so moving to (6,4) would be collision.\n> \n> Similarly, for (5,3), it's empty, no body, no wall.\n> \n> Down to (5,3) is possible.\n> \n> Left to (4,4) is obstacle, impossible.\n> \n> Up to (5,5) obstacle, impossible.\n> \n> So only possible move from (5,4) is down to (5,3)?

It's turn 67, and I'm playing Snake on a 7x7 grid, since the borders are x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7. That means the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think? Let me confirm: x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x from 1 to 6, similarly y from 1 to 6. But let's check the coordinates.\n> \n> The grid has walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the cells are from (1,1) to (6,6). Internal obstacles are given: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1). I should list all obstacles to avoid.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (5,4), then (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (3,3). So the snake has 12 segments. Head direction is left (L), meaning it was moving left to (5,4) from previous position. Since head is at (5,4) and previous was... positions are listed head first, so from head to tail: (5,4) head, then (6,4), which is right of head? Let's plot this.\n> \n> Grid is 6x6: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n> \n> Head: (5,4) moving left. So it came from (6,4)? Positions: [(5,4), (6,4), ...] so head is (5,4), next is (6,4), which is east of head? (5,4) and (6,4) are adjacent horizontally. Since head is at (5,4) and moving left, that means it was previously at (6,4) and moved left to (5,4). But in the list, (6,4) is the second segment, which is the neck. So current head position is (5,4), and it just moved left from (6,4) to (5,4). Now, for the next move, since it's moving left, I can't instantly reverse to right, so possible moves are up, down, or left, but not right.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (5,1) with life span 5, value +1\n> \n> - (6,2) with life span 7, value +1\n> \n> - (3,6) with life span 10, value +1? It says \"Value and Life Span\": (5,1,5,1) so (x,y,life_span,value). Value is 1, which is positive food.\n> \n> All food has value 1, so all are positive food? No negative food here.\n> \n> (3,6) is listed, but let's see where that is.\n> \n> Also, (3,6) is part of the snake body? Snake positions: (3,6) is the 7th segment?

Let's list:\n> \n> After move: head to (6,2)\n> \n> Since eat, body does not move, so all body segments stay: so segment 1 still at (5,3), segment 2 at (5,4), segment 3 at (6,4), segment 4 at (6,5), segment 5 at (6,6), segment 6 at (5,6), segment 7 at (4,6), segment 8 at (3,6), segment 9 at (2,6), segment 10 at (2,5), segment 11 at (2,4)\n> \n> Then a new segment is added at the previous tail position, which was (2,4), but (2,4) is now segment 11, so new segment 12 at (2,4)? That would be two segments at same cell, impossible.\n> \n> I think I have confusion.\n> \n> When you eat, the head moves to the food cell, and the tail does not move, so the new length has the tail staying, and the body segments remain in place.\n> \n> For example, before move, positions: H, B1, B2, ..., Bk, T\n> \n> After moving to food: new head at food, B1 to Bk remain, T remains, and a new segment is added at T, so new positions: H_new, B1, B2, ..., Bk, T, new_T\n> \n> So the tail cell has two segments now? No: the positions are: head at new position, then the first body segment B1 at its position, ..., up to the old tail T at its position, and a new tail added at the same position as T? That doesn't make sense.\n> \n> I think I need to clarify the growth mechanism.\n> \n> Typically in Snake, when you eat food, the head moves to the food cell, and a new segment is added to the tail, so the tail position doesn't change that turn, meaning that the cell where the tail was remains occupied by the new tail, and no vacating.\n> \n> In terms of positions, when you move without eating, the tail moves forward, vacating its cell.\n> \n> When you eat, the tail stays, so no vacating, and the snake grows.\n> \n> So for positions: before move, snake has segments S0, S1, S2, ..., Sn where S0 head, Sn tail.\n> \n> Move to new cell for head.\n> \n> If not food, new head at new cell, then S1 to new S0 position, S2 to old S1 position, ..., Sn to old Sn-1 position, and old Sn vacated.\n> \n> If food, new head at food cell, then S1 to S0, S2 to S1, ..., Sn to Sn-1? No, the body doesn't move; only the head moves to the new cell, and the body stays, but since the head moved, the neck should move to the old head position, etc.\n> \n> I think I have it wrong.\n> \n> Standard: the snake always moves one cell per turn, with the head moving to a new cell.\n> \n> Then, if the new cell has food, the snake grows, so the tail does not move, and a new segment is added at the tail position.\n> \n> Otherwise, the tail moves to the next position, vacating the old tail cell.\n> \n> In terms of positions:\n> \n> - When moving to empty cell: new head position, then each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so the tail moves, old tail cell vacated.\n> \n> - When moving to food cell: new head position, then each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, but the tail does not move; instead, the tail position stays, and a new segment is added there, so the tail cell is not vacated, and the snake grows.\n> \n> The movement of body segments is the same; only when eating, the tail doesn't advance, so the last position is duplicated.\n> \n> For example, positions before move: H, B1, B2, ..., T\n> \n> After move to new cell C:\n> \n> - If C not food: new positions: C (new H), H (new B1), B1 (new B2), ..., Bk (new T), and T vacated.\n> \n> - If C food: new positions: C (new H), H (new B1), B1 (new B2), ..., Bk (new B_{k+1}), T (new T, since tail doesn't move), so T remains, and new segment added at T, so positions: C, H, B1, B2, ..., Bk, T with T at same position.\n> \n> In this case, for the body, B1 moves to H, B2 to B1, etc., but T stays.\n> \n> In the sequence, the number of segments increases.\n> \n> In our case, for turn 69, moving to (6,2) which is food.\n> \n> Before move at turn 68: positions: H (6,3), B1 (5,3), B2 (5,4), B3 (6,4), B4 (6,5), B5 (6,6), B6 (5,6), B7 (4,6), B8 (3,6), B9 (2,6), B10 (2,5), B11 (2,4) tail.\n> \n> Move to (6,2) on turn 69.\n> \n> (6,2) is food, so after move:\n> \n> New head: (6,2)\n> \n> Then new B1: old H (6,3)\n> \n> New B2: old B1 (5,3)\n> \n> New B3: old B2 (5,4)\n> \n> New B4: old B3 (6,4)\n> \n> New B5: old B4 (6,5)\n> \n> New B6: old B5 (6,6)\n> \n> New B7: old B6 (5,6)\n> \n> New B8: old B7 (4,6)\n> \n> New B9: old B8 (3,6)\n> \n> New B10: old B9 (2,6)\n> \n> New B11: old B10 (2,5)\n> \n> New B12: old B11 (2,4)  // new tail, since tail didn't move, added at old tail position\n> \n> Old tail was at (2,4), now new B12 at (2,4), so position occupied.\n> \n> Snake length 13 now.\n> \n> Head at (6,2), which has only one possible move: up to (6,3), since other directions blocked.\n> \n> (6,3) is now occupied by B1, which is body, not tail.

That means x from 0 to 7, but since walls are occupied, the snake can only be on cells where 1 ≤ x ≤ 6 and 1 ≤ y ≤ 6? No, x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x from 1 to 6, similarly y from 1 to 6. But let's see the snake positions: (4,3), (5,3), etc., all between 1 and 6, so yes, grid is 1 to 6 in both x and y.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: [(5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1)]. So these cells are blocked and snake can't go there.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (4,3), then (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4). So the snake is 12 segments long. Head direction is L, meaning left, so it was moving left to (4,3) from previous position.\n> \n> Head direction is given as L, and positions: head (4,3), then (5,3). Since head is (4,3) and next is (5,3), which is to the right, but direction is L? That might be a mistake. Head direction should indicate the direction it moved to get to the current head position.\n> \n> Current head position is (4,3), and the previous head position was (5,3), since snake positions are head first: [(4,3), (5,3), ...]. So from (5,3) to (4,3) is left, so direction L makes sense; it moved left to (4,3).\n> \n> Now, food:\n> \n> - (5,1) with life span 3, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (6,2) with life span 5, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (3,6) with life span 8, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> All food is positive, no negative food mentioned. Value is 1 for all.\n> \n> Life span: for (5,1) it's 3, meaning it disappears after 3 turns, including current turn? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so after N turns, it vanishes.\n> \n> Current turn is t1=69.\n> \n> I need to plan an action sequence for multiple turns ahead, at least 5 turns, to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n> \n> First, let's map the grid.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n> \n> Walls: borders are walls, so cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are out of bounds. Internal obstacles: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1). So these are blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions: let's list them to see occupied cells.\n> \n> Head: (4,3)\n> \n> Body: (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4)\n> \n> Tail is at (2,4)\n> \n> Food at: (5,1), (6,2), (3,6)\n> \n> (3,6) is listed as food, but (3,6) is also part of the snake body? Snake positions include (3,6) as the 9th segment? Let's count:\n> \n> Positions: index 0: (4,3) head, 1: (5,3), 2: (5,4), 3: (6,4), 4: (6,5), 5: (6,6), 6: (5,6), 7: (4,6), 8: (3,6), 9: (2,6), 10: (2,5), 11: (2,4) tail.\n> \n> So (3,6) is occupied by the snake body, segment 8.\n> \n> But food is at (3,6) with life span 8, value 1.\n> \n> Food can spawn under the snake's body, but it can only be eaten if the body moves away and then head moves onto it.\n> \n> Currently, (3,6) has food under it, but since snake is there, it can't be eaten now. Only when the snake moves and that cell is vacated, and later head moves there.\n> \n> Similarly, other food: (5,1) and (6,2) are not occupied by snake, I think.\n> \n> (5,1): is it occupied? Snake positions: (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), etc., no (5,1). Similarly (6,2) not listed. (5,1) is y=1, which might be border? Walls: y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=1 is playable.\n> \n> y=0 is wall, y=7 is wall, so y from 1 to 6 are playable. (5,1) is x=5,y=1, which is within 1-6, so it's a valid cell.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,2) x=6,y=2.\n> \n> Now, internal obstacles include (6,1), which is wall, so (6,1) is blocked.\n> \n> (5,1) is not an obstacle, I think. Obstacles are: (5,2), (4,4), etc., (5,1) is not listed, so it should be free except for food.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,2) is not listed as obstacle.\n> \n> But (6,1) is obstacle, so (6,2) should be free.\n> \n> Now, head at (4,3), direction L, so it can move U, D, L, R but not reverse, which would be R, since L is left, reverse is right.\n> \n> Current direction L, so cannot move R on next turn.\n> \n> Possible moves from (4,3):\n> \n> - Up: to (4,4) but (4,4) is an internal obstacle? Obstacles include (4,4), yes, so (4,4) is wall, cannot move there.\n> \n> - Down: to (4,2). Is (4,2) free? Not occupied by snake or wall? Snake positions: no (4,2), walls: y=0 is wall, but (4,2) is y=2, which is not border. Internal obstacles: (5,2) is obstacle, but (4,2) not listed, so should be free.\n> \n> - Left: to (3,3). (3,3) not occupied? Snake positions: head (4,3), then (5,3), etc., no (3,3). Not a wall.\n> \n> - Right: to (5,3), but (5,3) is the body segment, but since it's the neck, moving right would cause collision? Let's see.\n> \n> The snake body: positions are [(4,3) head, (5,3) next, then (5,4), etc.]. So if head moves to (5,3), which is occupied by the first body segment, that would be a collision because the body segment is still there when head moves in.\n> \n> But the rules say: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> In this case, (5,3) is the second segment, not the tail. Tail is (2,4).\n> \n> When the snake moves, the head moves to a new position, and the tail moves away from its current position, so the cell that was tail becomes free, but other body cells remain until the snake moves.\n> \n> Specifically, when head moves to a new cell, if that cell is occupied by any body segment except the tail, it's a collision. If it's the tail, it's ok because tail moves.\n> \n> Here, (5,3) is the first body segment, not tail. Tail is (2,4). So moving to (5,3) would be collision.\n> \n> Similarly, moving to any cell occupied by body except tail is death.\n> \n> Now, possible moves from (4,3):\n> \n> - U: (4,4) - but (4,4) is internal obstacle, wall, cannot.\n> \n> - D: (4,2) - seems free? Let's check if occupied or wall.\n> \n> Cells: (4,2) - x=4,y=2. Not border wall. Internal obstacles: (5,2) is obstacle, but not (4,2). Snake positions: no (4,2). So should be free.\n> \n> - L: (3,3) - similarly, not wall, not occupied by snake. Internal obstacles include (3,4)? (3,4) is obstacle, but (3,3) not listed. Snake positions: (3,6) is body, but (3,3) not there. So free.\n> \n> - R: (5,3) - but (5,3) is occupied by body segment (index 1), so moving there would cause collision, death. Not possible.\n> \n> Also, cannot move reverse, which is R, but it's not possible anyway.\n> \n> So possible moves: Down to (4,2) or Left to (3,3).\n> \n> Now, I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n> \n> Food available:\n> \n> - (5,1) with life span 3, value 1. Current turn t=69, so it disappears after turn 71? Life span decreases each turn including current, so at turn 69, life span 3, meaning it will be there for 3 turns: turn 69,70,71, gone at turn 72.\n> \n> - (6,2) with life span 5, so present until turn 73? Turn 69:5, 70:4, 71:3, 72:2, 73:1, gone at 74? Life span N, after N turns it disappears. So if at turn t, life span L, it will disappear at turn t + L - 1? Let's clarify.\n> \n> Rule: \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So at turn t, with life span L, it decreases to L-1 at turn t+1, and so on, until L=0, it disappears at the end of that turn or beginning? Typically, it disappears after the countdown.\n> \n> \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so at turn t, countdown is L, after turn t, it becomes L-1 for turn t+1. When countdown reaches 0, it disappears.\n> \n> So for food at (5,1) at turn 69, life span 3: at turn 69, countdown=3; after turn 69, countdown=2 for turn 70; after turn 70, countdown=1 for turn 71; after turn 71, countdown=0, disappears before turn 72 or at turn 72? I think it's available until countdown 1, and disappears when countdown becomes 0.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,2) life span 5 at turn 69: countdown=5 at turn 69, decreases to 4 at turn 70, etc., down to 1 at turn 73, disappears at turn 74.\n> \n> (3,6) life span 8: countdown=8 at turn 69, decreases to 1 at turn 76, disappears at turn 77.\n> \n> But (3,6) is currently occupied by snake body, so it can't be eaten until the snake moves away.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (4,3), can move to (4,2) or (3,3).\n> \n> I need to plan a sequence of actions for several turns.\n> \n> First, let's consider the immediate move.\n> \n> If I move down to (4,2), then head is at (4,2), and the snake body moves: tail moves away, so the new positions would be head at (4,2), then previous head (4,3) becomes body, then (5,3), (5,4), ..., up to (2,5), and tail (2,4) is removed? No.\n> \n> When snake moves, head moves to new cell, and each segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, so the tail segment is removed from its position.\n> \n> So from current: positions [ (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4) ]\n> \n> If head moves to (4,2), new head (4,2), then body: (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5) and tail (2,4) is gone, so the snake has 12 segments? No, length unchanged unless food eaten.\n> \n> After move, positions: new head at (4,2), then the first body segment is old head (4,3), then (5,3), ..., up to (2,5), and the last segment (2,4) is not there anymore, so the snake shortens? No.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when moving without eating, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so the tail cell is vacated.\n> \n> So after moving down to (4,2):\n> \n> - Head: (4,2)\n> \n> - Body: (4,3) [was head], (5,3) [was seg1], (5,4) [was seg2], (6,4) [was seg3], (6,5) [was seg4], (6,6) [was seg5], (5,6) [was seg6], (4,6) [was seg7], (3,6) [was seg8], (2,6) [was seg9], (2,5) [was seg10], and (2,4) was tail, now removed.

Then body: segment 1 moves to old head (4,3), segment 2 moves to (5,3), segment 3 to (5,4), ..., segment 11 to (2,5), and segment 12 (tail) was at (2,4), but since no growth, tail is not added, so the new tail is the cell that was segment 10, which is (2,5), and (2,4) is vacated.\n> \n> New positions: [ (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5) ] and (2,4) free now.\n> \n> Similarly, if move left to (3,3): new head (3,3), body [ (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), ..., up to (2,5) ], tail at (2,5), and (2,4) free.\n> \n> Now, back to choices.\n> \n> Move down to (4,2) or left to (3,3).\n> \n> From (4,2), possible next moves: but let's think about food and risks.\n> \n> Food at (5,1) is close, at (5,1), which is down-left from (4,2)?

The grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think? Let me confirm the coordinates.\n> \n> Walls: Border cells x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7. That means x from 0 to 7, but since walls are occupied, the snake can only be on cells where 1 ≤ x ≤ 6 and 1 ≤ y ≤ 6? No, x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x from 1 to 6, similarly y from 1 to 6. But let's see the snake positions: (4,3), (5,3), etc., all between 1 and 6, so yes, grid is 1 to 6 in both x and y.\n> \n> Internal obstacles: [(5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1)].

So the snake is 12 segments long. Head direction is L, meaning left, so it was moving left to (4,3) from previous position.\n> \n> Head direction is given as L, and positions: head (4,3), then (5,3). Since head is (4,3) and next is (5,3), which is to the right, but direction is L? That might be a mistake. Head direction should indicate the direction it moved to get to the current head position.\n> \n> Current head position is (4,3), and the previous head position was (5,3), since snake positions are head first: [(4,3), (5,3), ...]. So from (5,3) to (4,3) is left, so direction L makes sense; it moved left to (4,3).\n> \n> Now, food:\n> \n> - (5,1) with life span 3, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (6,2) with life span 5, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (3,6) with life span 8, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> All food is positive, no negative food mentioned.

Snake positions: no (4,2), walls: y=0 is wall, but (4,2) is y=2, which is not border. Internal obstacles: (5,2) is obstacle, but (4,2) not listed, so should be free.\n> \n> - Left: to (3,3). (3,3) not occupied? Snake positions: head (4,3), then (5,3), etc., no (3,3). Not a wall.\n> \n> - Right: to (5,3), but (5,3) is the body segment, but since it's the neck, moving right would cause collision? Let's see.\n> \n> The snake body: positions are [(4,3) head, (5,3) next, then (5,4), etc.]. So if head moves to (5,3), which is occupied by the first body segment, that would be a collision because the body segment is still there when head moves in.\n> \n> But the rules say: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> In this case, (5,3) is the second segment, not the tail. Tail is (2,4).\n> \n> When the snake moves, the head moves to a new position, and the tail moves away from its current position, so the cell that was tail becomes free, but other body cells remain until the snake moves.\n> \n> Specifically, when head moves to a new cell, if that cell is occupied by any body segment except the tail, it's a collision. If it's the tail, it's ok because tail moves.\n> \n> Here, (5,3) is the first body segment, not tail. Tail is (2,4). So moving to (5,3) would be collision.\n> \n> Similarly, moving to any cell occupied by body except tail is death.\n> \n> Now, possible moves from (4,3):\n> \n> - U: (4,4) - but (4,4) is internal obstacle, wall, cannot.\n> \n> - D: (4,2) - seems free? Let's check if occupied or wall.\n> \n> Cells: (4,2) - x=4,y=2. Not border wall. Internal obstacles: (5,2) is obstacle, but not (4,2). Snake positions: no (4,2). So should be free.\n> \n> - L: (3,3) - similarly, not wall, not occupied by snake. Internal obstacles include (3,4)? (3,4) is obstacle, but (3,3) not listed. Snake positions: (3,6) is body, but (3,3) not there. So free.\n> \n> - R: (5,3) - but (5,3) is occupied by body segment (index 1), so moving there would cause collision, death. Not possible.\n> \n> Also, cannot move reverse, which is R, but it's not possible anyway.\n> \n> So possible moves: Down to (4,2) or Left to (3,3).\n> \n> Now, I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n> \n> Food available:\n> \n> - (5,1) with life span 3, value 1. Current turn t=69, so it disappears after turn 71? Life span decreases each turn including current, so at turn 69, life span 3, meaning it will be there for 3 turns: turn 69,70,71, gone at turn 72.\n> \n> - (6,2) with life span 5, so present until turn 73? Turn 69:5, 70:4, 71:3, 72:2, 73:1, gone at 74? Life span N, after N turns it disappears. So if at turn t, life span L, it will disappear at turn t + L - 1? Let's clarify.\n> \n> Rule: \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So at turn t, with life span L, it decreases to L-1 at turn t+1, and so on, until L=0, it disappears at the end of that turn or beginning? Typically, it disappears after the countdown.\n> \n> \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so at turn t, countdown is L, after turn t, it becomes L-1 for turn t+1. When countdown reaches 0, it disappears.\n> \n> So for food at (5,1) at turn 69, life span 3: at turn 69, countdown=3; after turn 69, countdown=2 for turn 70; after turn 70, countdown=1 for turn 71; after turn 71, countdown=0, disappears before turn 72 or at turn 72? I think it's available until countdown 1, and disappears when countdown becomes 0.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,2) life span 5 at turn 69: countdown=5 at turn 69, decreases to 4 at turn 70, etc., down to 1 at turn 73, disappears at turn 74.\n> \n> (3,6) life span 8: countdown=8 at turn 69, decreases to 1 at turn 76, disappears at turn 77.\n> \n> But (3,6) is currently occupied by snake body, so it can't be eaten until the snake moves away.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (4,3), can move to (4,2) or (3,3).\n> \n> I need to plan a sequence of actions for several turns.\n> \n> First, let's consider the immediate move.\n> \n> If I move down to (4,2), then head is at (4,2), and the snake body moves: tail moves away, so the new positions would be head at (4,2), then previous head (4,3) becomes body, then (5,3), (5,4), ..., up to (2,5), and tail (2,4) is removed? No.\n> \n> When snake moves, head moves to new cell, and each segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, so the tail segment is removed from its position.\n> \n> So from current: positions [ (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4) ]\n> \n> If head moves to (4,2), new head (4,2), then body: (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5) and tail (2,4) is gone, so the snake has 12 segments?

It's turn 71, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid (since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the grid goes from (0,0) to (7,7)).\n> \n> Walls are at the borders and internal obstacles at: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1). So these are cells I must avoid.\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (3,2), and the body segments follow: (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6). So the snake has 12 segments. Head direction is down (D), meaning it was moving downward to reach (3,2) from (3,3)? Let's see the positions: from head to tail: (3,2) is head, then (3,3), which is above it, so if head is at (3,2) and previous was (3,3), that means it moved down to (3,2) from (3,3). But direction is given as D, which is down, so current head direction is down.\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (5,1) with value 1, life span 1\n> \n> - (6,2) with value 1, life span 3? Wait, the format says (x,y, life_span, value), but in the input it's listed as (5,1,1,1), (6,2,3,1), etc. Let me read: \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value: - (5, 1, 1, 1) - (6, 2, 3, 1) - (3, 6, 6, 1) - (4, 5, 9, 1)\"\n> \n> I think it's (x,y, life_span, value). So:\n> \n> - (5,1): life_span=1, value=1 (positive food)\n> \n> - (6,2): life_span=3, value=1 (positive)\n> \n> - (3,6): life_span=6, value=1 (positive)\n> \n> - (4,5): life_span=9, value=1 (positive)\n> \n> All food here is positive with value 1, so eating any gives +1 score and increases length by 1.\n> \n> Now, life_span: for (5,1), life_span=1, meaning it will disappear after this turn if not eaten? Life_span decreases every turn, including current. So on turn 71, life_span is 1, so after this turn (turn 71), it will disappear. If I eat it on turn 71, I get it, but if not, it's gone.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,2) has life_span=3, so it will last for 3 more turns including current, so disappears after turn 73 if not eaten? Let's clarify: life_span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn t, with life_span N, it will be there for N turns, and disappear after N turns.\n> \n> The rule says: \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So for a food with life_span N at turn t, it will disappear at the end of turn t + N - 1? I need to be careful.\n> \n> Typically, if life_span is N at turn t, it means it has N turns left, including the current turn. After N turns, it's gone.\n> \n> For example, at turn t, life_span N: it can be eaten on turns t, t+1, ..., up to t + N - 1? Let's think.\n> \n> If countdown decreases every turn including current, and it disappears after N turns.\n> \n> Suppose at turn t, life_span = N. After turn t, countdown becomes N-1. After turn t+1, it becomes N-2, and so on, until it reaches 0, and then it disappears. So when life_span reaches 0, it disappears.\n> \n> So for food at (5,1): life_span=1 at turn 71. After turn 71, life_span becomes 0, so it disappears immediately after turn 71. That means it can only be eaten on turn 71, if I move to it now.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,2): life_span=3 at turn 71. After turn 71, it becomes 2, then after turn 72, 1, after turn 73, 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten on turns 71, 72, or 73.\n> \n> (3,6): life_span=6, so lasts until turn 76 (after turn 71, 70 left? Turn 71: life=6, after turn 71: life=5, ..., after turn 76: life=0, disappear. So can be eaten turns 71 to 76.\n> \n> (4,5): life_span=9, lasts until turn 79.\n> \n> Now, snake head is at (3,2), direction down. So from (3,2), possible moves: U (up, to (3,3)), D (down, to (3,1)), L (left, to (2,2)), R (right, to (4,2)).\n> \n> But I need to consider constraints.\n> \n> First, no instant reverse: current direction is D (down), so I cannot move up (U) next, because that would be opposite. So U is forbidden for this turn.\n> \n> Possible moves from (3,2): D to (3,1), L to (2,2), R to (4,2). U is invalid because reverse.\n> \n> Now, check for collisions.\n> \n> First, walls: borders x=0,7 y=0,7.

I can only move one step per turn. So I cannot reach (5,1) this turn; it's too far. Since it disappears after this turn, I cannot eat it. So (5,1) is inaccessible for me; I should ignore it.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,2) is at (6,2), which is adjacent to? From (3,2), not adjacent. Can be eaten in turns 71-73.\n> \n> (3,6) is at (3,6), which is part of the snake body! Look: snake positions include (3,6), which is the 11th segment or something. Positions: index 0: (3,2) head, 1: (3,3), 2: (4,3), 3: (5,3), 4: (5,4), 5: (6,4), 6: (6,5), 7: (6,6), 8: (5,6), 9: (4,6), 10: (3,6), 11: (2,6) tail.\n> \n> So (3,6) is a body segment. Food at (3,6) is under the snake body.\n> \n> Special case: food can spawn under body, but can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves onto it.\n> \n> So for (3,6), it has food with value 1, life span 6.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,5) has food, but (4,5) is not in snake positions?

(4,1) to (6,2) is not adjacent; (4,1) to (6,2) is Δx=2, Δy=1, so not reachable in one move. From (4,1) on turn 73, I can move to (5,1) or (3,1), not to (6,2). (6,2) from (4,1) is not adjacent; possible moves from (4,1) are to (4,0) wall, (4,2) body, (3,1), (5,1).

Let's see the movement.\n> \n> After a move, each segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> So for example, if head moves to new pos, then segment 1 moves to old head pos, segment 2 moves to old seg1 pos, and so on, tail is removed.\n> \n> So for (3,6), which is index 10, after a move, it will move to the position of index 9, which is (4,6).\n> \n> Similarly, the cell (3,6) will be vacated if the segment moves away.\n> \n> But when the snake moves, the segment at (3,6) will move to (4,6), so the cell (3,6) becomes free, but then the new position at (4,6) is occupied by the segment that was at (3,6), so (4,6) is now occupied by a different segment.\n> \n> The cell (3,6) is vacated after the move.\n> \n> Similarly, the food there can be eaten if head moves to it after it's vacated.\n> \n> But in this case, after any move, the cell (3,6) might be vacated or not, depending on the move.\n> \n> Let's simulate a move.\n> \n> Suppose on turn 71, I move the head to some position.\n> \n> Case 1: move D to (3,1).\n> \n> As before, new positions: head (3,1), body (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6).

Therefore, moving U is slightly better in terms of survival turns.\n\n### Considering Food\n\nNow, let's see if we can reach any food to extend survival:\n\n1. **Food at (6,2)**:\n   - Life span 3: must be eaten by turn 74\n   - Currently at turn 72, so need to eat by turn 74\n   - From (2,2), moving U to (2,3) then to (2,4) doesn't help reach (6,2)\n   - From (2,2), moving D to (2,1) then R to (3,1) also doesn't help\n   - Seems impossible to reach (6,2) in time\n\n2. **Food at (3,6)**:\n   - After moving on turn 72, tail moves away from (3,6), exposing the food\n   - Life span 5: must be eaten by turn 76\n   - From (2,2), moving U to (2,3) then to (2,4) etc. doesn't approach (3,6)\n   - From (2,2), moving D to (2,1) then R to (3,1) is slightly closer but still far\n\n3. **Food at (4,5)**:\n   - Life span 8: can be eaten later\n   - From (2,2), moving U to (2,3) then to (2,4) etc. doesn't approach (4,5)\n   - From (2,2),\n Therefore, the final answer is \\boxed{S}",
        "state": "**Current Turn**: \\( t_0 = 72 \\)\n**Cells occupied by walls**:\n\t - Border Cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7.\n\t - Internal Obstacles: [(5, 2), (4, 4), (1, 2), (1, 5), (1, 4), (3, 4), (5, 5), (6, 1)]\n**Snake Positions**:[(2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 3), (5, 3), (5, 4), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6), (5, 6), (4, 6), (3, 6)]\n**Snake Head Direction**: L\n**Food Positions, Life Span and Value**:\n\t- (6, 2, 3, 1)\n\t- (3, 6, 5, 1)\n\t- (4, 5, 8, 1)\n> **Guidance from a Previous Thinking Model:** Turn \\( t_1 = 72 \\)\n> <think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 72, and the grid is 8x8 since borders are from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7.

So the snake is 12 segments long.\n> \n> Head direction is L, which means left, so last move was to the left. Since the head is at (2,2) and previous was (3,2), moving left to (2,2) makes sense.\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (6,2) with life span 3, value 1 (positive food)\n> \n> - (3,6) with life span 5, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (4,5) with life span 8, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> All food is positive, no negative food here. Life span indicates how many turns left before they disappear, including the current turn. So for (6,2), it has 3 turns left, meaning it will disappear after turn 74 if not eaten? Let's see: life span decreases each turn, including current. So at turn 72, life span is 3, so it will be there for turns 72,73,74, and disappear before turn 75. Similarly, (3,6) with life span 5: present for turns 72,73,74,75,76, gone before 77. (4,5) with life span 8: turns 72 to 79.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan an action sequence for at least 5 turns ahead, but since the problem says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", I should plan for more if possible. But the answer format might expect a sequence for the next few turns.\n> \n> Also, I must avoid risks and prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> First, let's map out the grid to visualize.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls at borders and internal: (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1).\n> \n> Snake positions:\n> \n> Head: (2,2)\n> \n> Body: (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6)\n> \n> So tail is at (3,6).\n> \n> Head direction L, so coming from right, at (2,2).\n> \n> Possible moves: since head is at (2,2) and direction is L, I can move L, U, D, but not R because that would be instant reverse? No instant reverse means I cannot move opposite to current direction. Current direction is L, so opposite is R. So I cannot move right on the next turn. But I can move up, down, or left.\n> \n> Available moves from (2,2):\n> \n> - Left: (1,2) – but (1,2) is an internal obstacle wall, so I cannot move there. Walls are deadly, so moving to (1,2) is invalid.\n> \n> - Up: (2,3) – let's see if this is free. Snake body: (3,2), (3,3), etc. (2,3) is not in the body positions listed. Body positions: (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6). So (2,3) is empty? Also, check walls: no wall at (2,3), borders are x=0,7 or y=0,7, so (2,3) should be free.\n> \n> x=2,y=3: not a border cell, not in internal obstacles: internal obstacles are (5,2), (4,4), (1,2), (1,5), (1,4), (3,4), (5,5), (6,1). So (2,3) is clear.\n> \n> - Down: (2,1) – y=1, not border, not in obstacles. Snake body: (3,2) is at y=2, not (2,1). So should be free.\n> \n> - Right: (3,2) – but (3,2) is the first body segment. Moving to body segment would cause collision, except for the tail, but only if it's the tail and we're moving into it, but here (3,2) is not the tail, it's the segment right after head.\n> \n> Collision: head touches any body segment except the tail, but when moving into the tail cell, it's okay because the tail moves away.\n> \n> In this case, (3,2) is the second segment, not the tail. Tail is at (3,6). So moving to (3,2) would cause collision with body.\n> \n> Also, cannot move left to (1,2) because wall.\n> \n> So from (2,2), possible moves:\n> \n> - Up to (2,3)\n> \n> - Down to (2,1)\n> \n> - Cannot move left (wall) or right (body collision).\n> \n> Now, direction constraint: since last move was left to (2,2), I cannot move right on this turn, but right is invalid anyway. So only up or down are possible and allowed.\n> \n> Now, I need to think about food and survival.\n> \n> Food locations:\n> \n> - (6,2): life span 3, so must be eaten by turn 74.\n> \n> - (3,6): life span 5, eat by 76.\n> \n> - (4,5): life span 8, eat by 79.\n> \n> But (3,6) is the tail position? Snake positions include (3,6), which is the tail.\n> \n> Food at (3,6) is on the tail cell.\n> \n> But for food under the body, it can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves onto it.\n> \n> Specifically for (3,6), it's the tail, so when the snake moves, the tail will move away if we don't eat food, but since food is there, we need to have the head move to it after the tail moves.\n> \n> The rule: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> Also, \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> Let's see where tail is: (3,6)\n> \n> Head is at (2,2), not adjacent to (3,6). Adjacent means sharing an edge, so (2,2) and (3,6) are not adjacent; distance is |2-3| + |2-6| = 1 + 4 = 5, not adjacent.\n> \n> So no immediate danger.\n> \n> Now, for food at (3,6): since it's under the tail, to eat it, we need the tail to move away, then head move to (3,6).\n> \n> Similarly, other food.\n> \n> But eating (3,6) might be tricky because the snake is long, and we need to navigate to it.\n> \n> First, let's consider immediate moves.\n> \n> From head (2,2), I can go up to (2,3) or down to (2,1).\n> \n> I need to plan multiple turns ahead.\n> \n> Let me sketch the grid.\n> \n> List all occupied cells.\n> \n> Walls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.

So food is under the tail.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,5) is food, but is it under snake? Snake has (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6) — (4,5) is not in snake positions, so it's free. Snake positions don't include (4,5), so it's empty with food.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,2) is food, not in snake positions.\n> \n> (3,6) is occupied by snake tail, with food.\n> \n> Now, for turn 72, I need to choose action: U or D.\n> \n> Let's consider consequences.\n> \n> If I go up to (2,3):\n> \n> - Turn 72: move to (2,3)\n> \n> Then head at (2,3), body follows: new head (2,3), then (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), etc., tail at (3,6) moves? When head moves to (2,3), the tail (3,6) will move to the next segment? No.\n> \n> Snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, the tail end is removed unless food is eaten.\n> \n> If no food eaten, head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, so the tail is removed.\n> \n> Specifically: after moving to (2,3), the new snake positions: head (2,3), then the previous head (2,2) becomes body, so (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6) — and the tail (3,6) is removed because no food eaten, so snake has 11 segments now? Original was 12 segments, after move without eating, length same, so tail removed.\n> \n> Original positions: 12 cells.\n> \n> After move: head to (2,3), so positions: (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6) — that's 12 positions? (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6) — but (4,6) was the second last, tail was (3,6), so when moving, the segment at (3,6) is removed, so the new tail is (4,6).\n> \n> List: after move, head to (2,3), then the first body segment is the previous head (2,2), then next is previous (3,2), then (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), and then (4,6) which was before (5,6), so positions: (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6) — and (3,6) is gone. So 12 segments? No: original 12, we moved without eating, so length unchanged, so one segment removed from tail.\n> \n> Original: index 0: (2,2), 1: (3,2), 2: (3,3), 3: (4,3), 4: (5,3), 5: (5,4), 6: (6,4), 7: (6,5), 8: (6,6), 9: (5,6), 10: (4,6), 11: (3,6)\n> \n> After moving head to (2,3) without eating: new head (2,3), then body: old head (2,2) at position 1, old position 1 (3,2) at position 2, and so on, up to old position 10 (4,6) at position 11, and old tail (3,6) is removed. So new positions: head (2,3), then (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6) — that's 12 segments? Positions from 0 to 11: 12 segments.\n> \n> But length should be same if no food eaten, so it should be 11 segments now? I think I'm confusing.\n> \n> Standard snake: when no food, head moves to new cell, tail cell is vacated, so snake has same length.\n> \n> In terms of positions, the new snake has the new head and all but the last segment of the old snake.\n> \n> Old snake: segments S0, S1, S2, ..., S11, with S0 head, S11 tail.\n> \n> After move to new cell N: new head N, then S0, S1, S2, ..., S10. S11 is removed. So new snake has 12 segments? S0 to S10 is 11 segments, plus new head, 12? No.\n> \n> S0 is the old head, which becomes the neck, so new segments: new head, then old S0, old S1, ..., old S10. Old S11 is removed.\n> \n> Number of segments: old had 12, after move, new head, and old S0 to S10, which is 11 segments, so total 12 segments? Old S0 to S11: 12 segments.\n> \n> After: new head, old S0, old S1, ..., old S10. Old S0 to S10 is 11 segments, plus new head, 12 segments. But since no food eaten, length should be same, 12, so it's correct, tail is removed only if food not eaten, but the segment count remains the same because the head adds a new segment, but tail removes one, so net same.\n> \n> In this case, new snake: positions from new head to old second-to-last.\n> \n> Old positions: indices 0 to 11.\n> \n> After move to new cell: new position 0: new head, position 1: old position 0, position 2: old position 1, ..., position 11: old position 10. Old position 11 (tail) is removed.\n> \n> So new snake has 12 segments, with new tail at old position 10.\n> \n> In this case, for up move: new head (2,3), then body: (2,2) [old head], (3,2) [old body1], (3,3) [old body2], (4,3) [old body3], (5,3) [old body4], (5,4) [old body5], (6,4) [old body6], (6,5) [old body7], (6,6) [old body8], (5,6) [old body9], (4,6) [old body10], and old body11 (3,6) removed. So new tail is (4,6).\n> \n> Similarly, if I move down to (2,1), new head (2,1), body: (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), tail (4,6) or what?

Internal obstacles include (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), so (1,3) is free.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,3) is body position?
