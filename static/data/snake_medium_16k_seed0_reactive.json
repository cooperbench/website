        "thinking": "### Understanding the Problem\n\nFirst, I need to understand the current state of the Snake game:\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The game is played on an 8x8 grid (since x and y range from 0 to 7).\n2. **Walls**:\n   - **Border Walls**: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. These are the edges of the grid.\n   - **Internal Obstacles**: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3). These are additional walls inside the grid.\n3. **Snake**:\n   - **Positions**: Only the head is present at (3,3). This implies the snake is of length 1.\n   - **Direction**: The head is currently moving Left (L).\n4. **Food**:\n   - Three pieces of food:\n     - (3,5): value=1, life_span=10\n     - (2,2): value=1, life_span=10\n     - (4,3): value=1, life_span=10\n\n### Initial Observations\n\n- Since the snake is of length 1, the only body part is the head. There's no tail to worry about collisions yet.\n- The current direction is Left (L), meaning the head is moving towards decreasing x-coordinate.\n- The food at (4,3) is directly to the right of the snake's head (since (3+1,3) = (4,3)).\n\n### Possible Actions\n\nGiven the current direction is Left (L), the possible next moves are:\n1. **Continue Left (L)**: Move to (2,3).\n2. **Turn Up (U)**: Move to (3,4).\n3. **Turn Down (D)**: Move to (3,2).\n\nNote: Turning Right (R) is the opposite of the current direction (L), so it's not allowed.\n\n### Evaluating Each Action\n\n#### 1. Continue Left (L) to (2,3)\n- **New Position**: (2,3)\n- **Check for Walls**:\n  - x=0 is a wall, but (2,3) is not on the border or an internal obstacle.\n- **Check for Food**:\n  - No food at (2,3).\n- **Outcome**: Safe move, but no immediate reward.\n\n#### 2. Turn Up (U) to (3,4)\n- **New Position**: (3,4)\n- **Check for Walls**:\n  - Not a border wall. Check internal obstacles: (1,4), (4,4), (2,4) are obstacles, but (3,4) is not listed.\n- **Check for Food**:\n  - No food at (3,4).\n- **Outcome**: Safe move, but no immediate reward.\n\n#### 3. Turn Down (D) to (3,2)\n- **New Position**: (3,2)\n- **Check for Walls**:\n  - Not a border wall. No internal obstacles at (3,2).\n- **Check for Food**:\n  - No food at (3,2).\n- **Outcome**: Safe move, but no immediate reward.\n\n#### Bonus Consideration: Food at (4,3)\n- The food at (4,3) is adjacent to the current head position (3,3).\n- However, to reach it, the snake would need to move Right (R), which is the opposite of the current direction (L).\n- **Opposite Move Constraint**: The snake cannot reverse direction instantly, so moving Right is not allowed.\n\n### Analyzing Food Accessibility\n\nLooking at the food positions:\n1. **(3,5)**: Up and Up again from (3,3).\n   - First move Up to (3,4), then Up again to (3,5).\n   - But need to ensure no obstacles in the path.\n2. **(2,2)**: Left to (2,3), then Down to (2,2).\n   - First move Left to (2,3), then Down to (2,2).\n3. **(4,3)**: Not directly accessible because it requires a Right move, which is forbidden.\n\n### Planning a Path to Food\n\nGiven the current state, the snake can plan to reach either (3,5) or (2,2).\n\n#### Path to (3,5):\n1. **First Move**: Up to (3,4).\n   - Valid and safe.\n2. **Second Move**: Up to (3,5).\n   - Check for walls: (3,5) is not a wall.\n   - Check for food: Yes, (3,5) has food.\n   - **Outcome**: Can eat food in two moves.\n\n#### Path to (2,2):\n1. **First Move**: Left to (2,3).\n   - Valid and safe.\n2. **Second Move**: Down to (2,2).\n   - Check for walls: (2,2) is not a wall.\n   - Check for food: Yes, (2,2) has food.\n   - **Outcome**: Can eat food in two moves.\n\n### Choosing the Optimal First Move\n\nSince both paths require two moves, we need to decide which is better.\n\n**Considerations**:\n- **Distance**: Both are equidistant.\n- **Obstacles**: \n  - For (3,5), after the first move to (3,4), the next move is Up. No obstacles.\n  - For (2,2), after the first move to (2,3), the next move is Down. No obstacles.\n- **Future Flexibility**: \n  - Moving Up might open more options in the upper part of the grid.\n  - Moving Left might be restrictive due to the wall at x=0.\n\n### Immediate Decision\n\nAt turn \\( t_0 = 0 \\), the snake needs to make the first move towards one of the food items.\n\n- **Option 1**: Up (U) towards (3,5).\n- **Option 2**: Left (L) towards (2,2).\n\nSince the snake is currently moving Left, continuing Left maintains the current direction, which might be simpler. However, changing direction to Up is also valid and might be better for exploring the grid.\n\nBut, looking at the internal obstacles:\n- Moving Left to (2,3) is safe.\n- Moving Up to (3,4) is also safe.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nSince both options are equally valid, I might choose to move Up (U) to start heading towards (3,5). This is because the upper part of the grid has fewer internal obstacles compared to the left side, which has walls at (1,4), (2,4), and (4,4).\n\nHowever, the immediate move Up doesn't guarantee a better path, but it's a safe choice.\n\n### Verification\n\n- **Up (U)**: (3,3) → (3,4)\n  - Next move can be Up to (3,5) to eat food.\n  - Or Left to (2,4), but (2,4) is a wall → invalid.\n  - Or Right to (4,4), but (4,4) is a wall → invalid.\n  - Or Down to (3,3), but that's the previous position → might be invalid if it's considered a reverse move.\n\n- **Left (L)**: (3,3) → (2,3)\n  - Next move can be Left to (1,3), but (1,3) is safe.\n  - Or Up to (2,4), but (2,4) is a wall → invalid.\n  - Or Down to (2,2) to eat food.\n\nBoth options have their merits, but moving Left seems more straightforward as the next move after Left can be Down to (2,2) to eat food.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter considering both options, I think moving Left is better because it leads directly to a path where the next move can be Down to eat the food at (2,2).\n\n\\boxed{L}",

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State\n\nFirst, let's break down the given information to understand the current state of the game.\n\n1. **Current Turn**: \\( t_0 = 1 \\)\n   - This is the first turn of the game.\n\n2. **Cells occupied by walls**:\n   - **Border Cells**: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. This means the grid is bounded by walls at these coordinates. The playable area is from x=1 to x=6 and y=1 to y=6.\n   - **Internal Obstacles**: [(5, 6), (1, 4), (4, 4), (2, 4), (6, 3)]. These are additional walls inside the grid that the snake cannot pass through.\n\n3. **Snake Positions**: [(2, 3)]\n   - The snake currently consists of only its head at position (2, 3). There are no body segments yet since the length is 1.\n\n4. **Snake Head Direction**: L (Left)\n   - The snake is currently moving to the left. On the previous move, it must have moved left to reach (2, 3), so the direction is left.\n\n5. **Food Positions, Life Span, and Value**:\n   - (3, 5, 9, 1): Position (3,5), life span 9, value +1 (positive food)\n   - (2, 2, 9, 1): Position (2,2), life span 9, value +1\n   - (4, 3, 9, 1): Position (4,3), life span 9, value +1\n   - (6, 4, 10, 1): Position (6,4), life span 10, value +1\n\n### Possible Actions\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However, there are constraints:\n\n1. **No instant reverse**: Since the current direction is Left (L), the snake cannot move Right (R) on the next move. So, possible moves are U, D, L.\n\n2. **Wall and Obstacle Collision**: The snake cannot move into a cell that is a wall or an internal obstacle.\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n#### 1. Move Left (L)\n   - Current head position: (2, 3)\n   - Move left: (x-1, y) → (1, 3)\n   - Check if (1, 3) is a wall or obstacle:\n     - Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 → (1,3) is within bounds.\n     - Internal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3) → (1,3) is not in this list.\n   - Also, since the snake has no body segments, no risk of body collision.\n   - Food at (1,3)? No food is listed at this position.\n   - **Conclusion**: Valid move, but no immediate reward.\n\n#### 2. Move Up (U)\n   - Move up: (x, y+1) → (2, 4)\n   - Check (2,4):\n     - Internal obstacles: (2,4) is in the list → cannot move here.\n   - **Conclusion**: Invalid move (would collide with obstacle).\n\n#### 3. Move Down (D)\n   - Move down: (x, y-1) → (2, 2)\n   - Check (2,2):\n     - Borders: y=2 is within 1-6.\n     - Internal obstacles: (2,2) is not listed.\n   - Food at (2,2): Yes, there is positive food with value +1.\n     - Since the snake has no body segments, no risk of \"Tail Reward Danger\".\n   - **Conclusion**: Valid move, can eat positive food, increasing length to 2.\n\n#### 4. Move Right (R)\n   - Not allowed because it's the reverse of current direction (L).\n\n### Evaluating Best Move\n\nPossible valid moves: Left (L) and Down (D).\n\n- **Move L (Left)**:\n  - New head position: (1,3)\n  - No food eaten.\n  - Snake remains length 1.\n  \n- **Move D (Down)**:\n  - New head position: (2,2)\n  - Eats positive food at (2,2).\n  - Snake length increases to 2 (body segment at previous head position (2,3)).\n\nBetween these, moving Down allows us to eat positive food and increase the snake's length, which is beneficial for maximizing score.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Dangers\n\nAfter moving Down:\n- New snake positions: [(2,2), (2,3)] (head at (2,2), body at (2,3)).\n- Next possible moves from (2,2):\n  - Cannot reverse direction (from Down to Up), so Up is not allowed next turn.\n  - Need to check surroundings for immediate dangers in future moves, but since we're only deciding the immediate action at \\( t_0 \\), this is sufficient.\n\n### Verifying Food Accessibility\n\nThe food at (2,2) is directly accessible by moving Down, and since the snake is length 1, there's no body to collide with after growing. The \"Tail Reward Danger\" doesn't apply here because the snake doesn't have a tail yet that could cause a collision after growing.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe best immediate action is to move Down to eat the positive food at (2,2), increasing the snake's length and score.\n\n\\boxed{D}",

This means the snake cannot move outside these boundaries.\n   - **Internal Obstacles**: \n     - (5, 6)\n     - (1, 4)\n     - (4, 4)\n     - (2, 4)\n     - (6, 3)\n3. **Snake**:\n   - **Positions**: Head at (2, 2), body segment at (2, 3).\n   - **Direction**: Currently moving Down (\"D\").\n4. **Food**:\n   - (3, 5): value = 1, life_span = 8\n   - (4, 3): value = 1, life_span = 8\n   - (6, 4): value = 1, life_span = 9\n\n### Visualizing the Snake and Food\n\nLet's visualize the snake and the food positions relative to the walls.\n\n- **Snake**:\n  - Head: (2, 2)\n  - Body: (2, 3)\n  \n  The snake is moving Down (D), which means in the previous move, the head was at (2, 3) and moved to (2, 2), so the body is now at (2, 3).\n\n- **Possible Moves**:\n  - From (2, 2), moving Down would go to (2, 1).\n  - Moving Left: (1, 2)\n  - Moving Right: (3, 2)\n  - Moving Up: (2, 3) — but this is the current body position.\n\nHowever, since the snake is currently moving Down, the opposite direction is Up. According to the rules, we cannot make an instant reverse, so we cannot move Up (to (2, 3)) next.\n\nSo, possible moves from (2, 2) are:\n- Down (D): (2, 1)\n- Left (L): (1, 2)\n- Right (R): (3, 2)\n\n### Checking for Wall Collisions\n\nNow, let's check if any of these moves would hit a wall or an internal obstacle.\n\n1. **Down (D) to (2, 1)**:\n   - y=1 is not a border wall (y=0 is).\n   - Check internal obstacles: (2,1) is not listed as an obstacle.\n   - Safe move.\n\n2. **Left (L) to (1, 2)**:\n   - x=1 is not a border wall.\n   - Check internal obstacles: (1,2) is not listed.\n   - Safe move.\n\n3. **Right (R) to (3, 2)**:\n   - x=3 is not a border wall.\n   - Check internal obstacles: (3,2) is not listed.\n   - Safe move.\n\nAll three possible moves are safe in terms of walls and obstacles.\n\n### Checking for Body Collisions\n\nNext, we need to ensure that moving to these positions doesn't collide with the snake's body.\n\nCurrent body segment is at (2, 3). After the move, the body will move to where the head is now, which is (2, 2).\n\nSo, after moving:\n- If we move Down to (2,1), new positions: [(2,1), (2,2)]\n- If we move Left to (1,2), new positions: [(1,2), (2,2)]\n- If we move Right to (3,2), new positions: [(3,2), (2,2)]\n\nNone of these new head positions overlap with the new body position (which is (2,2)), so no immediate body collision.\n\nHowever, we also need to consider the \"Tail Reward Danger\" rule: if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake.\n\nCurrently, the tail is at (2,3). After the move, the tail will be at (2,2). \n\nIs there food at (2,3)? Checking the food positions:\n- (3,5), (4,3), (6,4) — none at (2,3), so no danger from that.\n\nSimilarly, after the move, the tail will be at (2,2), and the head will be at one of the new positions. We need to ensure that in the next move, if we move towards the tail, there's no food there that could cause a collision.\n\nBut for the immediate move, this isn't a concern since the tail is moving to where the head is now, and there's no food there.\n\n### Evaluating Food Opportunities\n\nNow, let's see if any of the possible moves can lead us closer to food.\n\nCurrent food positions:\n1. (3,5): value = +1\n2. (4,3): value = +1\n3. (6,4): value = +1\n\nWe can calculate the Manhattan distance from each possible new head position to each food item.\n\n**Option 1: Move Down to (2,1)**\n- Distance to (3,5): |2-3| + |1-5| = 1 + 4 = 5\n- Distance to (4,3): |2-4| + |1-3| = 2 + 2 = 4\n- Distance to (6,4): |2-6| + |1-4| = 4 + 3 = 7\n\nClosest food is (4,3) with distance 4.\n\n**Option 2: Move Left to (1,2)**\n- Distance to (3,5): |1-3| + |2-5| = 2 + 3 = 5\n- Distance to (4,3): |1-4| + |2-3| = 3 + 1 = 4\n- Distance to (6,4): |1-6| + |2-4| = 5 + 2 = 7\n\nClosest food is (4,3) with distance 4.\n\n**Option 3: Move Right to (3,2)**\n- Distance to (3,5): |3-3| + |2-5| = 0 + 3 = 3\n- Distance to (4,3): |3-4| + |2-3| = 1 + 1 = 2\n- Distance to (6,4): |3-6| + |2-4| = 3 + 2 = 5\n\nClosest food is (4,3) with distance 2.\n\nMoving Right seems the most promising as it gets us closest to food (distance 2 to (4,3)).\n\n### Checking Immediate Food Access\n\nIs any food immediately accessible in one move?\n\nFrom (2,2):\n- (3,5): needs at least 3 moves (e.g., Right, Up, Up)\n- (4,3): can reach in 2 moves (Right to (3,2), then Right to (4,2), then Up to (4,3))\n- (6,4): multiple moves away\n\nNo food is directly adjacent to (2,2), so no immediate eating.\n\n### Considering Future Moves\n\nMoving Right to (3,2) seems best because:\n- It's safe (no walls or body collision).\n- It minimizes distance to the closest food (4,3).\n- From (3,2), next move could be Right to (4,2), then Up to (4,3) to eat the food.\n\nAlternative moves:\n- Down to (2,1): moves away from all food.\n- Left to (1,2): also moves away from most food except (4,3), but same distance as Down.\n\n### Verifying No Better Options\n\nIs there a better immediate move than Right?\n\nLooking at (6,4), it's further away, so not immediately beneficial.\n(3,5) is also far.\n\nRight seems optimal for approaching (4,3).\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter evaluating all options, moving **Right (R)** to (3,2) is the best immediate action to position the snake closer to the nearest positive food at (4,3) without any immediate risks.\n\n\\boxed{R}",

        "thinking": "Alright, let's tackle this Snake game scenario step by step. I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action to take at Turn \\( t_0 = 3 \\).\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions and Walls**:\n   - The grid is 8x8 (from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7).\n   - Border walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So, we can't move beyond these.\n   - Internal obstacles at: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3). These are like additional walls we can't move into.\n\n2. **Snake**:\n   - Positions: Head at (3,2), body segment at (2,2).\n   - Current direction: Right (R). This means the last move was to the right (from (2,2) to (3,2)).\n\n3. **Food**:\n   - Three pieces of food:\n     - (3,5): value=1, life_span=7\n     - (4,3): value=1, life_span=7\n     - (6,4): value=1, life_span=8\n   - All are positive food (+1 reward, length increases by 1).\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (3,2), moving Right (R) would take us to (4,2). But let's check all possible moves (U, D, L, R) considering:\n\n- **No instant reverse**: Last move was R, so we can't move Left (L) immediately.\n- **Wall and obstacle collisions**: Can't move into walls or obstacles.\n- **Body collision**: Can't move into body segments except the tail (since the tail moves forward).\n\nSo, possible moves from (3,2):\n\n1. **Up (U)**: (3,3)\n   - Check walls: Not a border wall (y=7 is far), no internal obstacles at (3,3).\n   - Check body: Snake body is at (2,2), so no collision.\n   - Valid move.\n\n2. **Down (D)**: (3,1)\n   - y=1 is not a border wall (y=0 is below).\n   - No internal obstacles at (3,1).\n   - Body at (2,2), no collision.\n   - Valid move.\n\n3. **Left (L)**: (2,2)\n   - Last move was R, so L is reverse. **Not allowed**.\n   - Even if allowed, body is at (2,2), but since the tail moves, it's technically okay, but reverse is forbidden.\n\n4. **Right (R)**: (4,2)\n   - x=4 is not a border wall (x=7 is far).\n   - No internal obstacles at (4,2).\n   - Body at (2,2), no collision.\n   - Valid move.\n\nSo, possible moves: U, D, R.\n\n### Evaluating Moves Based on Food\n\nNow, let's see which moves bring us closer to food or are safer.\n\n1. **Up (U) to (3,3)**:\n   - Closest food in this direction: (3,5) is above, but two steps up.\n   - No immediate food at (3,3).\n   - Next moves could be towards (3,5).\n\n2. **Down (D) to (3,1)**:\n   - No food in this direction immediately.\n   - Next moves could go towards (4,3) by moving right then up, but not direct.\n\n3. **Right (R) to (4,2)**:\n   - Next to (4,3) food (one move up from (4,2)).\n   - Direct path: R to (4,2), then U to (4,3) to eat food.\n\nAlso, check if moving R to (4,2) is safe:\n- Next turn, from (4,2), possible moves would be U, D, R (can't go L back to (3,2)).\n- U to (4,3) is food, but need to ensure no tail reward danger.\n\n### Checking Tail Reward Danger\n\nFrom current state:\n- Snake: [(3,2), (2,2)]\n- Tail is at (2,2).\n- Adjacent to head (3,2): adjacent cells are (3,3), (3,1), (2,2), (4,2).\n- Tail is at (2,2), which is adjacent to head.\n- Is there positive food at tail? No, food is at (3,5), (4,3), (6,4). So no danger here.\n\n### Choosing the Best Move\n\nBetween U, D, R:\n- R seems best as it positions us next to food at (4,3), which we can eat next turn by moving U.\n- U is safe but doesn't immediately help in getting food.\n- D is safe but moves away from food.\n\n### Verifying Safety of R to (4,2)\n\nAfter moving R to (4,2):\n- Snake: [(4,2), (3,2)]\n- Next turn, from (4,2), possible moves:\n  - U to (4,3): food there. Eating it would make snake [(4,3), (4,2), (3,2)].\n    - Then tail is at (3,2), which is not adjacent to new head (4,3), so no tail reward danger.\n  - D to (4,1): safe but no food.\n  - R to (5,2): safe (no walls or obstacles at (5,2)), but no food.\n\nSo, moving R now allows us to eat food at (4,3) next turn safely.\n\n### Alternative Consideration: Food at (6,4)\n\nAnother food is at (6,4). From (3,2):\n- To reach (6,4), path could be R to (4,2), then R to (5,2), then U to (5,3), then R to (6,3), but (6,3) is an obstacle. So blocked.\nAlternative path: R to (4,2), U to (4,3), R to (5,3), U to (5,4), R to (6,4). But (5,6) is an obstacle, but not in this path. Seems possible but longer.\n\n(4,3) is closer, so prioritize that.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nBest immediate action is to move Right (R) to (4,2), setting up to eat (4,3) next turn.\n\n\\boxed{R}",

However, there are constraints:\n\n1. **No Instant Reverse**: Since the current direction is Right (R), the snake cannot move Left (L) in the next move.\n   - **Allowed Directions**: U, D, R\n\n2. **Wall and Obstacle Collision**: The snake cannot move into a cell that is a wall or an obstacle.\n   - Current head position: (4,2)\n   - Possible moves:\n     - U: (4,3) → Check if this is a wall or obstacle.\n     - D: (4,1) → Check.\n     - R: (5,2) → Check.\n\nLet's check each:\n\n- **U: (4,3)**:\n  - Is (4,3) a wall or obstacle?\n    - Border walls: y=7 is top, y=0 is bottom, so y=3 is not a border wall.\n    - Internal obstacles: (4,4) is an obstacle, but (4,3) is not listed.\n  - **Conclusion**: Valid move.\n\n- **D: (4,1)**:\n  - y=1 is not a border wall.\n  - Not listed as an internal obstacle.\n  - **Conclusion**: Valid move.\n\n- **R: (5,2)**:\n  - x=5 is not a border wall (border is x=0 and x=7).\n  - Internal obstacles: (5,6) is an obstacle, but (5,2) is not.\n  - **Conclusion**: Valid move.\n\n### Checking for Food\n\nNow, let's see if any of the possible moves lead to food:\n\n1. **U: (4,3)**:\n   - Food at (4,3) with value=1, life_span=6.\n   - This is positive food (+1 score, length increases by 1).\n   - **Tail Position**: Current tail is at (3,2).

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding any risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**Current Turn**: 5  \n**Grid Size**: 8x8 (since borders are x=0/x=7 and y=0/y=7)  \n**Walls**:  \n- Borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7  \n- Internal Obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3)  \n\n**Snake**:  \n- Positions: Head at (4,3), then (4,2), then (3,2)  \n- Current Direction: Up (U)  \n\n**Food Items**:  \n1. (3,5): value=1, life_span=5  \n2. (6,4): value=1, life_span=6  \n3. (6,6): value=1, life_span=9  \n\n### Visualizing the Snake and Food\n\nLet me sketch a rough map to visualize positions:\n\n```\ny=7: -----------------\n...\ny=6: ... F3(6,6) ...\ny=5: F1(3,5) ...\ny=4: ... (internal walls at (1,4),(2,4),(4,4)) F2(6,4) ...\ny=3: H(4,3) ... (internal wall at (6,3))\ny=2: B(4,2) T(3,2) ...\ny=1: ...\ny=0: -----------------\nx=0 x=1 x=2 x=3 x=4 x=5 x=6 x=7\n```\n\n- H: Head at (4,3)\n- B: Body at (4,2)\n- T: Tail at (3,2)\n- F1, F2, F3: Food items\n\n### Possible Moves from Current Position (Head at (4,3), Direction U)\n\nFrom direction U (up), the snake just moved up to (4,3) from (4,2). The possible moves are:\n\n1. **Up (U)**: (4,4)  \n   - Check: (4,4) is an internal wall → Collision → Invalid  \n2. **Left (L)**: (3,3)  \n   - Check:  \n     - Not a wall: x=3 is not a border, y=3 is not a border, and (3,3) is not an internal wall.  \n     - Not part of the body: Snake body is at (4,2) and (3,2). (3,3) is not occupied by body.  \n     - Valid move.  \n3. **Right (R)**: (5,3)  \n   - Check:  \n     - Not a wall: x=5 is not a border, y=3 is not a border, and (5,3) is not an internal wall (internal walls are at (5,6), etc.).  \n     - Not part of the body: (5,3) is not in snake positions.  \n     - Valid move.  \n4. **Down (D)**: (4,2)  \n   - Check:  \n     - Opposite direction: Current direction is U, D is opposite → Cannot reverse instantly → Invalid  \n\nSo, valid moves are L (left) and R (right).\n\n### Evaluating Left (L) to (3,3)\n\n- New head position: (3,3)  \n- Check for food at (3,3): No food listed there.  \n- Next turn's possible moves from (3,3):  \n  - Current direction would be L.  \n  - Can't reverse to R immediately.  \n  - Possible: U, D, L  \n\nNo immediate reward or risk here.\n\n### Evaluating Right (R) to (5,3)\n\n- New head position: (5,3)  \n- Check for food at (5,3): No food listed there.  \n- Next turn's possible moves from (5,3):  \n  - Current direction would be R.  \n  - Can't reverse to L immediately.  \n  - Possible: U, D, R  \n\nAlso no immediate reward or risk.\n\n### Considering Food Access\n\nLet's see if moving L or R can help reach food in future turns.\n\n**Food at (3,5)**:  \n- To reach (3,5) from (4,3):  \n  - Need to go left to (3,3), then up to (3,4), then up to (3,5).  \n  - (3,4): Not a wall, not occupied by snake currently.  \n  - But need to ensure no collisions in path.  \n\n**Food at (6,4)**:  \n- From (4,3):  \n  - Right to (5,3), then up to (5,4), but (5,4):  \n    - Check walls: (5,6) is a wall, but (5,4) is not listed as a wall.  \n    - Then right to (6,4).  \n  - But (6,3) is a wall, but that's below.  \n\n**Food at (6,6)**:  \n- Quite far, may not be reachable soon.  \n\nBetween L and R, moving left seems more promising to reach (3,5), which is closer.\n\n### Checking Tail Reward Danger\n\nIs there any food under the tail that could be dangerous if eaten?\n\nTail is at (3,2). Is there food at (3,2)? No, food is at (3,5), (6,4), (6,6). So no danger from tail food.\n\n### Checking Immediate Food Under Head or Body\n\nIs there food under the snake's body that could be eaten if head moves onto it after body moves away?\n\nCurrent snake positions: (4,3), (4,2), (3,2).  \nFood positions: (3,5), (6,4), (6,6). None under body. So no immediate food to eat this turn.\n\n### Decision Between L and R\n\nBoth L and R are safe moves with no immediate reward. Moving L seems better to approach (3,5), which is the closest positive food.\n\n### Verifying No Immediate Collisions\n\n- L to (3,3):  \n  - Not a wall, not body. Safe.  \n- R to (5,3):  \n  - Not a wall, not body. Safe.  \n\nBoth safe, but L is towards food.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter considering all options, moving **Left (L)** seems the better choice to position the snake closer to the nearest positive food at (3,5) without any immediate risks.\n\n\\boxed{L}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action to take at Turn 6.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**Snake Positions**: [(3, 3), (4, 3), (4, 2)]\n- Head is at (3, 3), direction is Left (L).\n- Body segments: (4, 3) and tail at (4, 2).\n\n**Food Items**:\n1. (3, 5): value = 4, life_span = 1\n2. (6, 4): value = 5, 1\n3. (6, 6): value = 8, 1\n\n**Walls**:\n- Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (can't go beyond these).\n- Internal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3)\n\n### Possible Moves from Current Position (3, 3), Direction Left\n\nFrom the current head position (3, 3) moving Left (L), the next possible directions are:\n- Left (L): (2, 3)\n- Up (U): (3, 4)\n- Down (D): (3, 2)\n\nCannot move Right (R) because that's the opposite of current direction (Left).\n\n### Checking Each Possible Move\n\n**1. Move Left (L) to (2, 3)**\n- Check for walls: (2,4) is a wall, but (2,3) is not listed as a wall.\n- Check for body collision: \n  - Current body segments are at (4,3) and (4,2). (2,3) is not on the body.\n- Check for food: No food at (2,3).\n- Is this safe? Yes, no immediate collision.\n\n**2. Move Up (U) to (3, 4)**\n- Check walls: (3,4) is not a wall.\n- Check body: Not on body.\n- Check food: No food at (3,4).\n- Safe move.\n\n**3. Move Down (D) to (3, 2)**\n- Check walls: Not a wall.\n- Check body: (4,2) is body, but (3,2) is not.\n- Check food: No food at (3,2).\n- Safe move.\n\n### Considering Food\n\nNow, let's see where the food is and if we can reach any safely.\n\nFood positions:\n1. (3,5): Up from head is (3,4), then (3,5). Need two moves Up.\n   - But life_span is 1, so it will disappear after this turn. Can't reach it in one move.\n2. (6,4): Current head is (3,3). To reach (6,4), need to go Right then Up, etc. Too far, life_span is 1.\n3. (6,6): Similarly, too far, life_span is 1.\n\nNone of the food can be reached in one move, so we don't need to consider eating food this turn.\n\n### Avoiding Future Collisions\n\nWe should also think about where the snake will be after this move to avoid trapping ourselves.\n\nCurrent body:\n- Head at (3,3), body at (4,3), tail at (4,2).\n\nAfter any move:\n- Head moves to new position, body follows:\n  - If head moves to (2,3), body becomes [(2,3), (3,3), (4,3)], tail (4,2) is gone.\n  - Similarly for other moves.\n\nNo immediate danger in any move, but let's see which is better for future options.\n\n**Move Left to (2,3):**\n- Next moves from (2,3): Can go Left (1,3), Up (2,4), Down (2,2).\n  - (2,4) is a wall (internal obstacle at (2,4)).\n  - So possible next moves: Left to (1,3), Down to (2,2).\n\n**Move Up to (3,4):**\n- Next moves: Left (2,4) - wall, Up (3,5), Right (4,4) - wall.\n  - So only Up to (3,5), but then next move from (3,5) is limited.\n\n**Move Down to (3,2):**\n- Next moves: Left (2,2), Down (3,1), Right (4,2) - but (4,2) is current tail, which will move away.\n  - So all three possible unless (4,2) is still body next turn, but tail moves, so (4,2) is free after this move.\n\n### Best Move\n\nSince no food is reachable this turn, and all moves are safe, we can choose any. But to maximize future options:\n\n- Moving Left to (2,3) leaves us with two possible moves next turn (Left to (1,3), Down to (2,2)).\n- Moving Down to (3,2) leaves three possible moves next turn (Left, Down, Right), but Right is into where the tail was, which is now free.\n  \nMoving Down seems to give more options next turn.\n\n### Checking Tail Reward Danger\n\nIs the tail adjacent to head with positive food?\n- Tail is at (4,2). Adjacent cells to head (3,3):\n  - (3,4), (3,2), (2,3), (4,3).\n  - Tail is at (4,2), not adjacent to head (adjacent to head is (4,3), which is body).\n  - So no tail reward danger.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAll moves are safe, no food to eat immediately, and moving Down gives more options next turn.\n\n\\boxed{D}",

I'm going to analyze the current state of the game and decide the best immediate action to take at Turn 7.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**1. Snake Position and Direction:**\n- **Snake Positions**: [(3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 3)]\n  - Head is at (3, 2).\n  - Body segments are at (3, 3) and (4, 3).\n- **Head Direction**: Down (D). This means the snake was moving downward in the previous turn (from (3, 3) to (3, 2)).\n\n**2. Walls and Obstacles:**\n- **Border Walls**: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So, the grid is from (1,1) to (6,6) excluding internal obstacles.\n- **Internal Obstacles**: [(5, 6), (1, 4), (4, 4), (2, 4), (6, 3)]\n  - These are cells the snake cannot move into.\n\n**3. Food Items:**\nEach food item is represented as (x, y, life_span, value).\n- (3, 5, 3, 1): Positive food at (3,5), life span 3, value +1.\n- (6, 4, 4, 1): Positive food at (6,4), life span 4, value +1.\n- (6, 6, 7, 1): Positive food at (6,6), life span 7, value +1.\n- (1, 5, 10, 1): Positive food at (1,5), life span 10, value +1.\n\nAll foods are positive (+1), and none are negative in this scenario.\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (3, 2) and direction D (down), the possible moves are:\n- **Up (U)**: (3, 3) - But this is the body segment immediately after the head. Moving here would cause a collision with the body unless the body moves away.\n- **Down (D)**: (3, 1) - y=1 is within bounds (y=0 is a wall, so y=1 is valid).\n- **Left (L)**: (2, 2) - Check for walls or obstacles: (2,4) is an obstacle, but (2,2) is clear.\n- **Right (R)**: (4, 2) - Check for walls or obstacles: (4,4) is an obstacle, but (4,2) is clear.\n\n**No instant reverse rule**: Since the current direction is D, the opposite is U. So, we cannot move U next. But in this case, moving U would lead to immediate collision with the body at (3,3), so it's not a viable move regardless.\n\n### Evaluating Possible Moves\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n1. **Down (D) to (3, 1)**:\n   - Check walls: y=0 is a wall, so y=1 is valid.\n   - Check body collision: The body is at (3,3) and (4,3). (3,1) is not part of the body.\n   - Food at (3,1)? No food listed there.\n   - After moving, the snake would be: [(3,1), (3,2), (3,3)] (tail at (4,3) moves away).\n   - No immediate reward, but safe move.\n\n2. **Left (L) to (2, 2)**:\n   - Check walls/obstacles: (2,2) is clear.\n   - Body collision: (2,2) is not in the body.\n   - Food at (2,2)? No.\n   - After moving: [(2,2), (3,2), (3,3)].\n   - Safe move, no reward.\n\n3. **Right (R) to (4, 2)**:\n   - Check walls/obstacles: (4,2) is clear (obstacle at (4,4)).\n   - Body collision: (4,2) is not in the body.\n   - Food at (4,2)? No.\n   - After moving: [(4,2), (3,2), (3,3)].\n   - Safe move, no reward.\n\n4. **Up (U) to (3, 3)**:\n   - This is the body segment immediately after the head.\n   - Normally, moving into the body is deadly unless it's the tail and the tail moves away.\n   - Current tail is at (4,3). After moving U to (3,3), the body would be [(3,3), (3,2), (4,3)].\n   - The new tail would be (4,3), but the head is at (3,3), and the next segment is (3,2), which is not adjacent to the new tail, so no immediate collision.\n   - However, the segment at (3,3) is the one we're moving into, which is the first body segment after the head. This would cause a collision because the head is moving into a body segment that hasn't moved away yet.\n   - Therefore, moving U is deadly and should be avoided.\n\nSo, U is invalid due to collision, and D, L, R are safe but don't lead to immediate food.\n\n### Checking for Food Opportunities\n\nNow, let's see if any food is reachable soon or if we can plan a path towards food.\n\nCurrent foods:\n1. (3,5): life span 3. Current turn 7, so disappears at turn 10.\n   - Distance from (3,2): |3-3| + |5-2| = 3.\n   - Need to move up thrice to reach it.\n   - But first move cannot be U (as discussed), so cannot reach it immediately.\n2. (6,4): life span 4, disappears at turn 11.\n   - Distance: |6-3| + |4-2| = 5.\n   - Need to move right and up.\n3. (6,6): life span 7, disappears at turn 14.\n   - Distance: |6-3| + |6-2| = 7.\n4. (1,5): life span 10, disappears at turn 17.\n   - Distance: |1-3| + |5-2| = 5.\n\nNone of the foods are adjacent to the current head position (3,2), so no immediate food can be eaten this turn.\n\n### Considering Future Moves\n\nSince no food is immediately accessible, we should choose a move that keeps options open for reaching food in the future.\n\nLooking at the closest food:\n- (3,5) is closest (distance 3), but requires moving up, which we can't do immediately.\n- Next is (6,4) and (1,5) at distance 5.\n\nTo reach (6,4), we'd need to move right and up. Starting with R might be better.\nTo reach (1,5), we'd need to move left and up. Starting with L might be better.\n\nAlternatively, moving down (D) to (3,1) doesn't seem to lead towards any food quickly.\n\nBetween L and R:\n- Moving L to (2,2): closer to (1,5).\n- Moving R to (4,2): closer to (6,4).\n\nBoth (6,4) and (1,5) have similar distances, but (6,4) disappears at turn 11, (1,5) at turn 17. (6,4) is more urgent.\n\nAlso, moving R to (4,2) might be better because:\n- From (4,2), next move could be R to (5,2), then U to (5,3), etc., towards (6,4).\n- From (2,2), moving towards (1,5) would require moving L to (1,2), then U to (1,3), etc., but (1,4) is an obstacle, making path to (1,5) tricky.\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nIs there any food under the tail that could be dangerous?\nCurrent tail is at (4,3). Is there food at (4,3)?\nLooking at food positions: no food at (4,3). So no danger from tail food.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nGiven that:\n- Moving U is deadly.\n- Moving D is safe but doesn't lead towards food.\n- Moving L is safe but path towards (1,5) is obstructed by (1,4).\n- Moving R is safe and provides a clearer path towards (6,4), which is more urgent than (1,5).\n\nTherefore, the best immediate action is to move **Right (R)**.\n\n\\boxed{R}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The grid is 8x8 (from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7).\n2. **Walls**:\n   - Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.\n   - Internal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3).\n3. **Snake**:\n   - Positions: Head at (4,2), then (3,2), then (3,3).\n   - Current direction: Right (R).\n4. **Food**:\n   - (3,5): value=1, life_span=2.\n   - (6,4): value=1, life_span=3.\n   - (6,6): value=1, life_span=6.\n   - (1,5): value=1, life_span=9.\n\n### Visualizing the Snake and Food\n\nLet me sketch the current positions to better understand:\n\n- Snake:\n  - Head: (4,2) - facing Right.\n  - Body: (3,2), (3,3).\n  \nSo, the snake is moving right from (3,2) to (4,2), with the tail at (3,3).\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (4,2) and direction R, the possible next moves are:\n\n1. **Continue Right (R)**: (5,2)\n   - Check if (5,2) is valid:\n     - Not a wall: x=5 is not a border (x=0 or 7), y=2 is not a border.\n     - Not an internal obstacle: (5,6) is the only internal obstacle at x=5, but y=6 ≠ 2.\n     - Not part of the snake's body: Body is at (3,2) and (3,3), (5,2) is clear.\n   - Valid move.\n\n2. **Turn Up (U)**: (4,3)\n   - Check (4,3):\n     - Not a border.\n     - Internal obstacles: (4,4) is at y=4, so (4,3) is clear.\n     - Snake body: (3,3) is at x=3, so (4,3) is clear.\n   - Valid move.\n\n3. **Turn Down (D)**: (4,1)\n   - Check (4,1):\n     - Not a border (y=0 is border, but y=1 is not).\n     - No internal obstacles at (4,1).\n     - Snake body: (3,2) is at y=2, (3,3) at y=3, so (4,1) is clear.\n   - Valid move.\n\n4. **Turn Left (L)**: (3,2)\n   - Check (3,2):\n     - This is the immediate body segment after the head.\n     - Normally, moving into the tail is allowed because the tail will move forward, but here the tail is at (3,3), and the body is at (3,2).\n     - Moving left would place the head at (3,2), which is the current first body segment.\n     - After the move, the tail moves from (3,3) to ... wait, let's see:\n       - Current snake: [(4,2), (3,2), (3,3)].\n       - Move L to (3,2):\n         - New head: (3,2).\n         - Body: (4,2), (3,2) - but (3,2) is now both head and first body segment? That's a collision.\n     - Actually, moving into the immediate body segment is a collision because the tail hasn't moved yet to free up space.\n     - So, moving Left is invalid (would collide with body).\n\n### Evaluating Valid Moves: R, U, D\n\nNow, let's evaluate the valid moves based on food proximity and safety.\n\n**Food Positions**:\n1. (3,5): value=1, life=2.\n2. (6,4): value=1, life=3.\n3. (6,6): value=1, life=6.\n4. (1,5): value=1, life=9.\n\n**Current head at (4,2)**.\n\nLet's see distances to food:\n\n1. (3,5):\n   - Manhattan distance: |4-3| + |2-5| = 1 + 3 = 4.\n2. (6,4):\n   - |4-6| + |2-4| = 2 + 2 = 4.\n3. (6,6):\n   - |4-6| + |2-6| = 2 + 4 = 6.\n4. (1,5):\n   - |4-1| + |2-5| = 3 + 3 = 6.\n\nClosest foods are (3,5) and (6,4) at distance 4.\n\n**Option 1: Move Right (R) to (5,2)**:\n- Next position: (5,2).\n- Distance to (6,4): |5-6| + |2-4| = 1 + 2 = 3.\n- Distance to (3,5): |5-3| + |2-5| = 2 + 3 = 5.\n- Moving towards (6,4).\n\n**Option 2: Move Up (U) to (4,3)**:\n- Next position: (4,3).\n- Distance to (3,5): |4-3| + |3-5| = 1 + 2 = 3.\n- Distance to (6,4): |4-6| + |3-4| = 2 + 1 = 3.\n- Moving towards both (3,5) and (6,4).\n\n**Option 3: Move Down (D) to (4,1)**:\n- Next position: (4,1).\n- Distance to (1,5): |4-1| + |1-5| = 3 + 4 = 7.\n- Distance to (6,6): |4-6| + |1-6| = 2 + 5 = 7.\n- Not moving towards any food directly.\n\nBetween R and U, both seem good. Let's see potential paths:\n\n- Moving Right to (5,2):\n  - Next possible moves from (5,2):\n    - Current direction is R, so can't move L next.\n    - Can move R to (6,2) - but (6,3) is a wall, so (6,2) is okay.\n    - Can move U to (5,3) - check walls: (6,3) is a wall, but (5,3) is clear.\n    - Can move D to (5,1) - clear.\n  - From (6,2), can then go U to (6,3) - but (6,3) is a wall, so can't.\n  - So, moving R seems to head towards (6,4), but may get stuck near walls.\n\n- Moving Up to (4,3):\n  - Next possible moves from (4,3):\n    - Current direction is U (since we turned from R to U).\n    - Can't move D next.\n    - Can move U to (4,4) - but (4,4) is an internal obstacle. Can't.\n    - Can move L to (3,3) - but current body is [(4,2), (3,2), (3,3)], so after moving to (4,3), body is [(4,3), (4,2), (3,2)], tail is at (3,2).\n     - Moving L to (3,3): is (3,3) in body? After move, body is [(4,3), (4,2), (3,2)], so (3,3) is clear.\n     - But (3,3) was tail, but tail moved to (3,2), so (3,3) is free.\n    - Can move R to (5,3) - clear.\n  - From (4,3), moving L to (3,3) is safe, then can go U to (3,4) towards (3,5).\n\nMoving Up seems to offer a clearer path towards (3,5), which is closer in terms of steps (distance reduces from 4 to 3).\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nWe need to ensure that if we eat food, the new tail doesn't collide with the head.\n\nCurrently, tail is at (3,3). If we eat food, the tail doesn't move, so the snake grows by one, and the new tail is the old tail (since length increases by 1).\n\nBut the \"Tail Reward Danger\" is when the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food. Here, tail is at (3,3), head is at (4,2). Adjacent means:\n\n- (3,3) is adjacent to (4,2)? Let's see:\n  - (3,3) and (4,2): |3-4| + |3-2| = 1 + 1 = 2. Not adjacent (adjacent is distance 1: same x and y differs by 1 or vice versa).\n  \nSo no immediate danger from tail reward.\n\n### Deciding the Move\n\nBetween R and U:\n\n- R: heads towards (6,4), but may get near walls.\n- U: heads towards (3,5), seems more straightforward.\n\nAlso, (3,5) has life_span=2, meaning it will disappear after 2 more turns (current turn is 8, so at turn 10 it's gone). (6,4) has life_span=3, so disappears at turn 11. Both are safe for now.\n\nGiven that, moving Up seems better to target (3,5).\n\n### Verifying Move Up\n\nMove U to (4,3):\n\n- New head: (4,3).\n- Body: [(4,3), (4,2), (3,2)].\n- Tail was at (3,3), which moves to (3,2) (since the segment before was (3,2)).\n- No collision.\n- Next turn, can move towards (3,5) by going Left to (3,3), then Up to (3,4), then Up to (3,5).\n\nSeems safe.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter evaluating, the best immediate action is to move **Up (U)** to position (4,3), aiming towards the food at (3,5).\n\n\\boxed{U}",

Can't go there.\n- **Left (L)**: (3,3) - need to check if this is safe.\n- **Right (R)**: (5,3) - need to check if this is safe.\n- **Down (D)**: (4,2) - but this is the current body segment (4,2). However, since the tail is at (3,2), moving down would make the head go to (4,2) and the tail moves away from (3,2), so this might not be a collision unless the snake grows. But since we're not eating food here, length stays the same, so tail moves away, and head moves to (4,2) where body was, but body moves away, so it's safe unless we're eating food that would make us grow into the tail.\n\nWait, let's clarify the movement:\n- If we move Down (D) to (4,2):\n  - Current body: [(4,3), (4,2), (3,2)]\n  - After move: head moves to (4,2), then body segments follow:\n    - First body segment moves to where head was: (4,3)\n    - Second body segment moves to where first was: (4,2)\n    - But now the head is at (4,2) and the second body segment is also moving to (4,2) at the same time, which would cause a collision. So moving Down is not safe.\n\nWait no, let's think step by step:\nCurrent snake: [H(4,3), B1(4,2), B2(3,2)]\nMove D:\n- New head: (4,2)\n- Then B1 moves to old H: (4,3)\n- B2 moves to old B1: (4,2)\nSo new snake: [(4,2), (4,3), (4,2)] - now head is at (4,2) and tail is at (4,2), which means the head and tail are colliding, which is deadly. So moving Down is not safe.\n\nSo Down is out.\n\nLeft (L) to (3,3):\n- Check if (3,3) is safe:\n  - Not a wall: walls are at x=0,7; y=0,7; and internal obstacles listed, (3,3) is not in them.\n  - Not in body: body is at (4,2) and (3,2), (3,3) is not in body.\n  - So safe to move to (3,3).\n\nRight (R) to (5,3):\n- Check if (5,3) is safe:\n  - Not a wall: not in internal obstacles (internal obstacles are at (5,6), etc., not (5,3)).\n  - Not in body: body is at (4,2) and (3,2), (5,3) is not in body.\n  - So safe to move to (5,3).\n\nUp is blocked by wall at (4,4), Down causes collision, so possible moves are Left to (3,3) or Right to (5,3).\n\n### Evaluating Food\n\nNow, let's see if moving Left or Right can eat any food.\n\n1. Left to (3,3):\n   - Food at (3,5), (6,4), (6,6), (1,5).\n   - (3,3) is not a food position, so no food eaten.\n   - So length remains the same.\n\n2. Right to (5,3):\n   - (5,3) is not a food position, so no food eaten.\n   - Length remains the same.\n\nSo neither move immediately eats food. But let's see if moving in one direction sets us up better for future food.\n\nFuture food considerations:\n- All food has life_span=1, meaning they disappear next turn, so we can't plan for them beyond this turn unless we can reach them now.\n- Can we reach any food this turn? Current head at (4,3), foods at:\n  - (3,5): distance is |4-3| + |3-5| = 1 + 2 = 3, can't reach in one move.\n  - (6,4): distance is |4-6| + |3-4| = 2 + 1 = 3, can't reach.\n  - (6,6): distance is |4-6| + |3-6| = 2 + 3 = 5, can't reach.\n  - (1,5): distance is |4-1| + |3-5| = 3 + 2 = 5, can't reach.\nSo no food is reachable this turn.\n\n### Avoiding Future Collisions\n\nSince we can't eat food this turn, we should choose a move that keeps options open next turn.\n\nLeft to (3,3):\n- Next head at (3,3), direction L.\n- Possible next moves from (3,3), direction L:\n  - Can't reverse to R.\n  - U: (3,4) - check:\n    - Not a wall: (3,4) is not in internal obstacles.\n    - Not in body: current body after move will be [(3,3), (4,3), (4,2)], so (3,4) is not in body.\n  - D: (3,2) - body will be [(3,3), (4,3), (4,2)], so (3,2) is not in body, but is it a wall? No, walls are at y=0, not y=2.\n  - L: (2,3) - not a wall, not in body.\nSo from (3,3), can go U, D, or L next turn.\n\nRight to (5,3):\n- Next head at (5,3), direction R.\n- Possible next moves from (5,3), direction R:\n  - Can't reverse to L.\n  - U: (5,4) - not a wall, not in body (body will be [(5,3), (4,3), (4,2)]).\n  - D: (5,2) - not a wall, not in body.\n  - R: (6,3) - but (6,3) is an internal obstacle (wall), so can't go R.\nSo from (5,3), can go U or D next turn.\n\nLeft gives more options next turn (U, D, L) vs Right (U, D), so Left seems better for keeping options open.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Dangers\n\nIs there any immediate danger in moving Left to (3,3)?\n- Not colliding with walls or body.\n- Not eating any food, so no risk of tail collision from growing.\n\nSimilarly for Right to (5,3), no immediate danger.\n\n### Decision\n\nBetween Left and Right, Left provides more options next turn (3 vs 2), so it's better for maneuverability.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{L}",

        "thinking": "Alright, let's tackle this Snake game scenario step by step. I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**Current Turn**: 10  \n**Walls**:\n- Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (so the grid is from (0,0) to (7,7))\n- Internal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3)\n\n**Snake Positions**: [(3,3), (4,3), (4,2)]  \nThis means:\n- Head: (3,3)\n- Body segment 1: (4,3)\n- Body segment 2 (tail): (4,2)\n\n**Snake Head Direction**: L (Left)  \nThis tells us the snake was moving left in the previous move.\n\n**Food Items**:\n1. (6,4) - value: 2, life_span: 1\n2. (6,6) - value: 4, life_span: 1\n3. (1,5) - value: 7, life_span: 1\n4. (3,2) - value: 10, life_span: 1\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the head at (3,3), the snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However, since the current direction is Left (L), the snake cannot instantly reverse to Right (R) on the next move. So, possible moves are U, D, L.\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n1. **Left (L)**: (3,3) → (2,3)\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: x=0 is at x=0, so x=2 is safe.\n     - Internal obstacles: (2,4) is an obstacle, but we're moving to (2,3), so no collision.\n     - Body: Snake body is at (4,3) and (4,2). (2,3) is not in the body, so safe.\n   - Check for food:\n     - No food at (2,3).\n   - Safe move, no immediate reward.\n\n2. **Up (U)**: (3,3) → (3,4)\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: y=7 is at y=7, so y=4 is safe.\n     - Internal obstacles: (1,4), (4,4), (2,4) are obstacles, but we're moving to (3,4), which is not listed.\n     - Body: (3,4) is not in [(4,3), (4,2)], so safe.\n   - Check for food:\n     - No food at (3,4).\n   - Safe move, no immediate reward.\n\n3. **Down (D)**: (3,3) → (3,2)\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: y=0 is at y=0, so y=2 is safe.\n     - Internal obstacles: None at (3,2).\n     - Body: (3,2) is not in [(4,3), (4,2)], wait—actually, the tail is at (4,2), but (3,2) is not the same, so safe.\n   - Check for food:\n     - There is food at (3,2) with value 10, life_span 1.\n     - Can we eat it? The food is under the snake's body? Let's see:\n       - Snake body: [(3,3), (4,3), (4,2)]. (3,2) is not under the snake's body, it's adjacent to the tail (4,2).\n       - The food is at (3,2), and the tail is at (4,2). They are adjacent but not overlapping.\n       - To eat this food, the head moves to (3,2), and the tail is at (4,2). After eating, the snake grows, so the new tail would be at (4,2), and the head at (3,2), with the previous head (3,3) becoming body.\n       - Would this cause a collision? New positions after eating: [(3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (4,2)].\n       - Check if head collides with body: head at (3,2), body at (3,3), (4,3), (4,2). No collision.\n       - Also, no \"Tail Reward Danger\" because the tail is at (4,2), and the food is at (3,2), not under the tail.\n     - So, we can safely eat the food at (3,2) for +10 points and grow in length.\n   - This seems like a very rewarding move.\n\n### Evaluating Food Options\n\nLooking at the food items:\n1. (6,4) - value 2, life_span 1: Far away, not reachable immediately.\n2. (6,6) - value 4, life_span 1: Also far.\n3. (1,5) - value 7, life_span 1: Far.\n4. (3,2) - value 10, life_span 1: Adjacent to head, can be eaten by moving Down.\n\nThe food at (3,2) is the most valuable and immediately accessible. It's also about to disappear next turn (life_span 1, and countdown decreases this turn, so after this turn, it's gone).\n\n### Decision\n\nMoving Down (D) to (3,2) allows the snake to eat the high-value food (+10) and grow safely without any collisions. The other moves don't provide any immediate reward and don't position the snake better for future rewards.\n\n### Verifying No Immediate Reverse\n\nCurrent direction is Left (L), so we cannot move Right (R). We're not choosing R, so this constraint is satisfied.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe best immediate action is to move Down (D) to eat the high-value food at (3,2).\n\n\\boxed{D}",

Move Left (L) to (2,2)\n- **Check for Collisions**:\n  - **Walls**: x=0 is a wall, but (2,2) is not a wall.\n  - **Body**: Snake body is at (3,3), (4,3), (4,2). (2,2) is not in the body.\n- **Food Check**: No food at (2,2).\n- **Safety**: Safe move, no immediate collision.\n\n#### 2. Move Right (R) to (4,2)\n- **Check for Collisions**:\n  - **Walls**: x=7 is a wall, (4,2) is not a wall.\n  - **Body**: (4,2) is the tail. Normally, moving into the tail is safe because the tail moves forward, but we need to check if the tail has positive food that would cause a collision after growth.\n    - Current tail is at (4,2). Is there positive food at (4,2)?\n    - Looking at food positions: (6,4), (6,6), (1,5) — none at (4,2).\n    - So, no food under tail, safe to move here.\n- **Food Check**: No food at (4,2).\n- **Safety**: Safe move.\n\n#### 3. Move Down (D) to (3,1)\n- **Check for Collisions**:\n  - **Walls**: y=0 is a wall, (3,1) is not y=0 yet (y=0 is (3,0)).\n  - **Body**: (3,1) is not in the body [(3,3), (4,3), (4,2)].\n- **Food Check**: No food at (3,1).\n- **Safety**: Safe move.\n\n### Evaluating Food Opportunities\n\nNow, let's see if any food is reachable in the next move or if we should plan to move towards food in future turns.\n\nCurrent food:\n1. (6,4): value=1, life_span=1 (will disappear after this turn if not eaten)\n2. (6,6): value=3, life_span=1 (will disappear after this turn)\n3. (1,5): value=6, life_span=1 (will disappear after this turn)\n\nNone of these foods are adjacent to the current head position (3,2), so we cannot eat any food this turn. \n\n### Choosing the Best Move\n\nSince no food is immediately accessible, the priority is to stay safe and possibly move towards higher-value food for future turns. \n\nLooking at the food:\n- (1,5): value=6 is the highest, but it's at (1,5), which is quite far (distance of |3-1| + |2-5| = 2 + 3 = 5).\n- (6,4) and (6,6) are closer but will disappear after this turn, so not reachable.\n\nGiven that, the best immediate move is to stay safe and not trap ourselves. \n\nLet's evaluate the safety of each possible move further:\n\n- **Left (L) to (2,2)**:\n  - Next possible moves from (2,2): U, L, D (cannot go R, which is back to (3,2)).\n    - U to (2,3): check walls/body. (2,3) is not a wall; body will have moved from (3,3) to (3,2), etc., so (2,3) is safe.\n    - L to (1,2): not a wall, not in new body.\n    - D to (2,1): not a wall, not in new body.\n  - Seems safe, multiple options next turn.\n\n- **Right (R) to (4,2)**:\n  - Next possible moves from (4,2): U, R, D (cannot go L to (3,2)).\n    - U to (4,3): current body is at (4,3), but after move, body will be [(4,2), (3,3), (4,3)], so (4,3) is part of body — collision if go U.\n    - R to (5,2): not a wall, not in new body.\n    - D to (4,1): not a wall, not in new body.\n  - Only two safe options next turn (R or D), but one leads to potential collision if we choose U.\n\n- **Down (D) to (3,1)**:\n  - Next possible moves from (3,1): L, R, D (cannot go U to (3,2)).\n    - L to (2,1): not wall, not in new body.\n    - R to (4,1): not wall, not in new body.\n    - D to (3,0): y=0 is wall — collision.\n  - Two safe options next turn (L or R).\n\nBetween L, R, D:\n- L and D offer two safe options next turn.\n- R offers two safe options but one is risky if we choose U next.\n- L seems slightly better because it's moving towards higher-value food at (1,5) in the long run.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Dangers\n\nIs there any immediate danger in choosing L?\n- New head at (2,2), body at [(2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3)] — tail at (4,3) will be removed if no food eaten.\n- No food at (2,2), so tail is removed, new body is [(2,2), (3,2), (3,3)].\n- Next head at (2,2), no adjacent food under tail (tail is at (3,3)), so no tail reward danger.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter evaluating all options, moving **Left (L)** seems the safest and provides flexibility for future moves while also moving towards the higher-value food at (1,5) in subsequent turns.\n\n\\boxed{L}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The grid is 8x8 (from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7).\n2. **Walls**:\n   - Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (can't move to these coordinates).\n   - Internal obstacles (can't move to these either): (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3).\n3. **Snake**:\n   - Positions: Head at (2,2), then (3,2), (3,3), (4,3) (tail).\n   - Current direction: Left (L).\n4. **Food**:\n   - (6,6): value=3, life_span=1.\n   - (1,5): value=5, life_span=1.\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (2,2) moving left (L), the possible next moves are:\n- **Left (L)**: (1,2)\n- **Up (U)**: (2,3)\n- **Down (D)**: (2,1)\n  \nCannot move Right (R) because that's the opposite of current direction (L), which is not allowed.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each possible move:\n\n#### 1. Move Left (L) to (1,2)\n- Check if (1,2) is valid:\n  - Not a wall: x=1 is not a border wall, and (1,2) is not in internal obstacles.\n  - Not part of the snake's body: Snake body is at (3,2), (3,3), (4,3). (1,2) is not there.\n- Is there food at (1,2)? No.\n- So, this is a safe move with no immediate reward.\n\n#### 2. Move Up (U) to (2,3)\n- Check (2,3):\n  - Not a wall.\n  - Snake body: (3,3) is part of the body, but (2,3) is not the same as (3,3), so safe.\n  - Food: No food at (2,3).\n- Safe move, no reward.\n\n#### 3. Move Down (D) to (2,1)\n- Check (2,1):\n  - Not a wall (y=1 is not a border, and (2,1) not in obstacles).\n  - Snake body: Not overlapping.\n  - Food: No.\n- Safe move, no reward.\n\n### Considering Food\n\nCurrently, the food is at:\n- (6,6): Far from the snake's current position (2,2). Moving towards it would take several moves, and its life_span is 1, meaning it will disappear after this turn. So, not reachable this turn.\n- (1,5): Also far, life_span=1, so it will disappear after this turn. Not reachable this turn.\n\nSo, no food is reachable this turn. Our goal is to avoid dying and position ourselves for future food.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Dangers\n\nIs there any immediate danger in any move?\n- Moving Left (L) to (1,2):\n  - Next turn, the tail will be at (3,2) (since the snake moves forward, tail segment at (4,3) will move to (3,3), and so on).\n  - No immediate collision risk.\n  \n- Moving Up (U) to (2,3):\n  - Next positions: head at (2,3), body at (2,2), (3,2), (3,3).\n  - No collision.\n  \n- Moving Down (D) to (2,1):\n  - Next positions: head at (2,1), body at (2,2), (3,2), (3,3).\n  - No collision.\n\nAll moves seem safe. Now, which move positions us better for future food?\n\n### Future Positioning\n\nLooking at the food that might appear next (since current food disappears), we want to move towards areas where food is more likely to appear or where we have more space.\n\n- Current snake is in the lower left area.\n- Moving Left (L) to (1,2) brings us closer to the left wall (x=0), which might limit future moves.\n- Moving Up (U) to (2,3) moves towards the center.\n- Moving Down (D) to (2,1) moves towards the bottom wall (y=0).\n\nBetween Up and Down, Up seems better because it moves towards the center where more food might appear, whereas Down moves towards the border.\n\n### Verifying Tail Reward Danger\n\nIs there any food under the tail that could be dangerous if we move in a certain way?\nCurrent tail is at (4,3). Is there food at (4,3)? No, food is at (6,6) and (1,5). So no danger from tail food.\n\n### Decision\n\nAll moves are safe this turn, but moving Up seems slightly better for future positioning. Moving Left is also safe but moves towards the wall. Down moves towards another wall.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{U}",

        "thinking": "Alright, let's tackle this Snake game scenario step by step. I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding any risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**Current Turn**: 13\n\n**Walls**:\n- Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. This means the grid is 8x8 (from (0,0) to (7,7)), and the snake can't go outside these bounds.\n- Internal obstacles (walls where the snake can't go):\n  - (5, 6)\n  - (1, 4)\n  - (4, 4)\n  - (2, 4)\n  - (6, 3)\n\n**Snake Positions**:\n- Head: (2, 3)\n- Body segments in order: (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)\n  \nSo, the snake's body forms a sort of \"L\" shape:\n- Head at (2,3)\n- Next at (2,2) - directly below the head\n- Then (3,2) - to the right\n- Then (3,3) - up, making the tail\n\n**Snake Head Direction**: Currently moving Up (U). This means the last move was from (2,2) to (2,3), moving upwards.\n\n**Food Items**:\nEach food is given as (x, y, life_span, value).\n1. (6, 6, 2, 1) - positive food at (6,6), life span 2, value +1\n2. (1, 5, 4, 1) - positive food at (1,5), life span 4, value +1\n3. (3, 4, 10, 1) - positive food at (3,4), life span 10, value +1\n\nAll foods are positive, so no negative foods to worry about here.\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (2,3) and current direction Up (U), the possible moves are Up, Left, or Right (can't go Down because that would reverse the direction from Up to Down, which is not allowed).\n\nLet's explore each possible move:\n\n1. **Up (U)**: Move from (2,3) to (2,4)\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: Is (2,4) a wall?\n       - Internal walls include (2,4) - yes! So this is a wall. Can't go here.\n     - Body: Even if not a wall, would it collide with body?\n       - Current body segments: (2,2), (3,2), (3,3)\n       - (2,4) is not in these, but it's a wall, so already invalid.\n   - **Conclusion**: Can't move Up.\n\n2. **Left (L)**: Move from (2,3) to (1,3)\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: Is (1,3) a wall?\n       - Border walls are x=0,7 and y=0,7 - (1,3) is within bounds.\n       - Internal walls: (1,4) is a wall, but (1,3) is not listed.\n     - Body: Is (1,3) in body segments?\n       - Body: (2,2), (3,2), (3,3) - no.\n   - Check for food:\n     - Is there food at (1,3)? Looking at food positions:\n       - (6,6), (1,5), (3,4) - no.\n   - **Conclusion**: Safe move, no food to eat.\n\n3. **Right (R)**: Move from (2,3) to (3,3)\n   - Check for collisions:\n     - Walls: Is (3,3) a wall?\n       - Not listed in internal or border walls.\n     - Body: Is (3,3) in body segments?\n       - Yes! (3,3) is the tail.\n       - Normally, moving into the tail is safe because the tail moves forward, but we need to check for \"Tail Reward Danger\".\n   - Check for food:\n     - Is there food at (3,3)? No, food is at (3,4), etc.\n   - Tail Reward Danger:\n     - The rule says: If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake.\n     - Here, the head is at (2,3), tail is at (3,3) - they are adjacent (right next to each other).\n     - Is there positive food at the tail (3,3)? No, food is at (3,4), etc.\n     - So no danger from eating tail food here.\n   - But is the tail moving away?\n     - Current body: [(2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3)]\n     - If head moves to (3,3), new body will be [(3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2)]\n     - The old tail (3,3) is now the head, and the new tail is (3,2).\n     - The segment that was at (2,3) moves to where the head was, and so on.\n     - But the key is that the head is moving to where the tail was, and the tail is moving away, so no collision.\n   - **Conclusion**: Safe move, no food to eat.\n\n### Evaluating Food Options\n\nNow, let's see if any food is reachable or beneficial to go for:\n\n1. (6,6,2,1):\n   - Distance from (2,3): |6-2| + |6-3| = 4 + 3 = 7 steps away.\n   - Life span: 2 turns left (including current turn), so after this move, it will disappear in 1 more turn.\n   - Impossible to reach in time (need at least 7 moves, only 1 left before it disappears).\n   - **Not viable**.\n\n2. (1,5,4,1):\n   - Distance from (2,3): |1-2| + |5-3| = 1 + 2 = 3 steps.\n   - Life span: 4 turns left.\n   - Can reach in 3 moves, life span will be 4 - 3 = 1 when we get there (since countdown decreases every turn including current).\n   - So possible to reach before it disappears.\n   - Path to (1,5):\n     - From (2,3), possible first moves towards it: Left to (1,3) is closer in x, then up to (1,4), but (1,4) is a wall.\n     - Alternative: Up is blocked by wall at (2,4), so Left is only option first.\n     - After Left to (1,3), next move could be Up to (1,4) - but (1,4) is wall, so can't.\n     - Only other option from (1,3) is Right (back to (2,3)) or Down to (1,2) - not helpful.\n     - Seems like (1,5) is actually not reachable because (1,4) is blocked.\n   - **Conclusion**: Cannot reach (1,5) due to wall at (1,4).\n\n3. (3,4,10,1):\n   - Distance from (2,3): |3-2| + |4-3| = 1 + 1 = 2 steps.\n   - Life span: 10 turns - plenty of time.\n   - Can reach in 2 moves.\n   - Path:\n     - First move: Right to (3,3), then Up to (3,4).\n     - Check if (3,4) is safe:\n       - Walls: Not listed.\n       - Body: After first move to (3,3), body is [(3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2)].\n       - Next move Up to (3,4): not in body segments.\n       - Also, no tail reward danger because tail is at (3,2), not adjacent to (3,4).\n   - **Conclusion**: Can reach (3,4) in two moves, eating +1 food safely.\n\n### Deciding Immediate Action\n\nOur options for immediate move at t=13:\n- Left (L) to (1,3): safe, no food, but doesn't lead to any immediate food.\n- Right (R) to (3,3): safe, no food, but sets up to go Up next to (3,4) to eat food.\n\nUp is blocked by wall, so can't go Up now.\n\nBetween Left and Right, Right is better because it's the first step towards reaching the food at (3,4).\n\nLeft doesn't lead to any food and seems to corner the snake more.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Food Under Head\n\nIs there food under the snake's body that can be eaten now?\n- Head is at (2,3), body at (2,2), (3,2), (3,3).\n- Food positions: (6,6), (1,5), (3,4) - none under body.\n- So no immediate food to eat by moving away and back.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe best immediate action is to move Right (R) to (3,3), setting up to move Up next turn to eat the food at (3,4).\n\n\\boxed{R}",

(3,4): value=1, life_span=9\n\nAll foods are positive (value=1), and none are negative in this scenario.\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the head at (3,3), the possible moves are:\n- Up (U): (3,4)\n- Down (D): (3,2)\n- Left (L): (2,3)\n- Right (R): (4,3)\n\nBut we have to consider:\n1. **No instant reverse**: Current direction is R, so cannot move L (left) next.\n   - So, cannot move to (2,3).\n2. **Wall and obstacle collisions**:\n   - Up to (3,4): Check if (3,4) is a wall or obstacle.\n     - Walls: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7. (3,4) is not on the border.\n     - Internal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3). (3,4) is not in this list.\n     - So, (3,4) is free.\n   - Down to (3,2):\n     - (3,2) is currently the tail (last segment). Normally, moving into the tail is safe because the tail will move forward, but we need to check if there's food there that could cause a collision after eating.\n     - Looking at food positions: none at (3,2).\n     - Also, (3,2) is not a wall or obstacle.\n     - So, (3,2) is safe to move into.\n   - Right to (4,3):\n     - Check (4,3):\n       - Not a border wall.\n       - Not in internal obstacles.\n       - Not occupied by any body segment except possibly the tail, but the tail is at (3,2).\n       - So, (4,3) is free.\n\nSo possible moves: U, D, R.\n\n### Checking Each Possible Move\n\n**1. Move Up (U) to (3,4)**:\n- New head position: (3,4)\n- Is there food at (3,4)? Yes: value=1, life_span=9.\n  - Eating it: length increases by 1, score +1.\n  - New snake: [(3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2)]\n  - Check for Tail Reward Danger: Is the head adjacent to the tail after eating?\n    - New tail is (3,2).\n    - Adjacent to (3,4)? (3,4) is adjacent to (3,3), (4,4), (2,4), (3,5). Not adjacent to (3,2).\n    - So no danger.\n- Is (3,4) safe otherwise? Yes, as checked earlier.\n- This seems safe and beneficial.\n\n**2. Move Down (D) to (3,2)**:\n- New head position: (3,2)\n- Is there food at (3,2)? No.\n- Snake movement: tail moves away, so new snake: [(3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2)]\n  - Tail was at (3,2), now moves to (2,2).\n- Is this safe?\n  - No immediate collision.\n  - But we're not gaining any points.\n- Not as good as moving up where we can eat food.\n\n**3. Move Right (R) to (4,3)**:\n- New head position: (4,3)\n- Is there food at (4,3)? No.\n- Snake movement: [(4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2)]\n  - Tail moves away from (3,2).\n- Safe move, but no score gain.\n- Not as good as moving up.\n\n### Comparing Moves\n\n- Up: Eat food, gain +1, length +1, safe.\n- Down: No gain, safe.\n- Right: No gain, safe.\n\nBest choice is Up to eat the food at (3,4).\n\n### Verifying No Immediate Dangers After Moving Up\n\nAfter moving Up:\n- Snake: [(3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2)]\n- Next possible moves from (3,4):\n  - Current direction would be U.\n  - Possible next moves: U, L, R (cannot reverse to D).\n  - Need to ensure that after this move, the snake isn't trapped or in immediate danger next turn.\n  - From (3,4), possible next moves:\n    - U to (3,5): Check if free.\n      - Not a border (y=7 is border, y=5 is fine).\n      - Not an obstacle.\n      - Not in body except possibly tail, but tail is at (3,2).\n      - Free.\n    - L to (2,4): \n      - Check (2,4): internal obstacle. Cannot move here.\n    - R to (4,4):\n      - Check (4,4): internal obstacle. Cannot move here.\n    - So next turn, only U is possible from (3,4).\n    - But that's okay; we can deal with that next turn.\n\n### Checking Other Foods\n\nOther foods:\n- (6,6): life_span=1, so will disappear after this turn if not eaten.\n  - Too far to reach now (head at (3,3), need at least 3 moves right and 3 up).\n- (1,5): life_span=3.\n  - Also far, not immediately reachable.\n  \nNo need to consider them for immediate move.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nBest immediate action is to move Up to eat the food at (3,4), gaining +1 score and increasing length safely.\n\n\\boxed{U}",

        "thinking": "Alright, let's tackle this Snake game scenario step by step. I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**Current Turn**: 15  \n**Walls**:\n- Border walls: x=0, x=7 (left and right edges), y=0, y=7 (bottom and top edges).\n- Internal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3)\n\n**Snake Positions**: \n- Head: (3,4)\n- Body segments: (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2)\n\nSo, the snake's body is as follows:\n- Head at (3,4)\n- Next segment at (3,3)\n- Then (2,3)\n- Then (2,2)\n- Tail at (3,2)\n\n**Snake Head Direction**: U (Up, which is increasing y-coordinate)\n\n**Food**:\n- Only one food item: at (1,5) with value=1 and life_span=3.\n\n### Visualizing the Grid\n\nLet's sketch a small part of the grid around the snake and food to visualize positions. The grid is 8x8 (from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7).\n\n- Snake head at (3,4), moving Up (U).\n- Next positions:\n  - Up from (3,4) is (3,5)\n  - Down: (3,3) - but this is the next body segment, so can't go there (would collide immediately).\n  - Left: (2,4)\n  - Right: (4,4)\n\nBut let's check walls and obstacles:\n- (2,4) is an internal obstacle, so can't go left.\n- (4,4) is also an internal obstacle, so can't go right.\n- Up to (3,5): is this free?\n  - Not a wall or obstacle listed.\n  - Not occupied by snake body (snake body is at (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2)).\n- Down to (3,3): occupied by body, so can't go there.\n\nSo, from current position (3,4) with direction U, possible moves:\n- Continue Up to (3,5) - seems possible.\n- Can't go left or right due to obstacles.\n- Can't go down due to body.\n\nBut wait, the rule says \"No instant reverse\": cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn. Current direction is U, so opposite is D. So moving D is not allowed, but in this case, D is already blocked by body, so it's a moot point.\n\n### Checking Food\n\nFood is at (1,5):\n- Current head is at (3,4).\n- To reach (1,5) from (3,4):\n  - Need to go left twice and up once, or up once and left twice.\n  - But can't do that in one move.\n  - Next move could be left to (2,4), but (2,4) is an obstacle.\n  - Or up to (3,5), then next move could be left to (2,5), then left to (1,5).\n  - But food has life_span=3, so it will disappear after 3 turns (including current turn 15), so it will be gone by turn 18.\n  - To eat it, need to reach it by turn 17 (since at turn 18 it disappears before we can eat it).\n  - From turn 15 to 17 is 2 moves: \n    - Turn 15: move ?\n    - Turn 16: move ?\n    - At start of turn 17, if head is at (1,5), can eat.\n  - Current head at (3,4). To reach (1,5) in 2 moves:\n    - Option 1: Left to (2,4) - but (2,4) is obstacle, so can't.\n    - Option 2: Up to (3,5), then left to (2,5), then left to (1,5) - but that's 3 moves, too late.\n  - So seems impossible to reach (1,5) before it disappears.\n\nTherefore, the food at (1,5) is not reachable in time to eat it.\n\n### Other Possible Moves\n\nFrom (3,4), possible moves:\n- Up to (3,5): \n  - Not a wall or obstacle.\n  - Not occupied by body.\n  - Safe move.\n- Left to (2,4): obstacle, can't.\n- Right to (4,4): obstacle, can't.\n- Down to (3,3): body, can't.\n\nSo only possible move is Up to (3,5).\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nThe rule mentions \"Tail Reward Danger\": If head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nIn our case:\n- Tail is at (3,2).\n- Adjacent cells to head (3,4):\n  - (3,5), (2,4), (4,4), (3,3).\n  - Tail is at (3,2), which is not adjacent to head (3,4) (distance is 2 in y-coordinate).\n  - So no tail reward danger here.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOnly possible safe move is Up to (3,5). Other directions are blocked by walls, obstacles, or body. The food is unreachable before it disappears, so no need to consider it for this move.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{U}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**Current Turn**: 16  \n**Grid Size**: 8x8 (since borders are x=0/x=7 and y=0/y=7)  \n**Walls**:  \n- Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7  \n- Internal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3)  \n\n**Snake**:  \n- Positions (head first): [(3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2)]  \n- Current direction: U (Up, which is (x, y+1))  \n\n**Food**:  \n1. (1,5): value = 2, life_span = 1  \n2. (1,1): value = 10, life_span = 1  \n\n### Visualizing the Snake and Food\n\nLet me visualize the snake's position and the food locations to better understand the scenario.\n\n- Snake:\n  - Head at (3,5)\n  - Body segments at (3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2)\n  \n- Food:\n  - (1,5): positive food (value=2), life_span=1 (will disappear next turn if not eaten)\n  - (1,1): positive food (value=10), life_span=1 (will disappear next turn if not eaten)\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However, since the current direction is Up, the snake cannot instantly reverse to Down (D) on the next move. So, possible moves are U, L, R.\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n#### 1. Move Up (U) - (3,6)\n- New head position: (3,6)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: y=7 is the upper border, so (3,6) is within bounds.\n  - Internal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3) - none at (3,6).\n  - Body collision: Snake body is at [(3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2)] - no overlap with (3,6).\n- Food at (3,6)? No food listed there.\n- Outcome: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n#### 2. Move Left (L) - (2,5)\n- New head position: (2,5)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: x=0 is left border, (2,5) is within bounds.\n  - Internal obstacles: none at (2,5).\n  - Body collision: Snake body is at [(3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2)] - no overlap with (2,5).\n- Food at (2,5)? No food listed there.\n- Outcome: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n#### 3. Move Right (R) - (4,5)\n- New head position: (4,5)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: x=7 is right border, (4,5) is within bounds.\n  - Internal obstacles: none at (4,5).\n  - Body collision: Snake body is at [(3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (2,2)] - no overlap with (4,5).\n- Food at (4,5)? No food listed there.\n- Outcome: Safe move, no food eaten.\n\n### Considering Food\n\nNow, let's look at the food positions and see if we can reach any of them safely.\n\n**Food at (1,5)**:\n- Current head at (3,5). To reach (1,5), need to move left twice: first to (2,5), then to (1,5).\n- But food's life_span is 1, meaning it will disappear after this turn (since countdown decreases every turn including current). So, we cannot reach it in this turn; it's too far.\n  \n**Food at (1,1)**:\n- Current head at (3,5). Distance is too great to reach in one move; life_span is also 1, so it will disappear after this turn. Cannot reach it this turn.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger\n\nWe need to check if the head is adjacent to the tail and if the tail cell has positive food that could cause a collision if eaten.\n\n- Tail is at (2,2).\n- Adjacent cells to tail: (1,2), (3,2), (2,1), (2,3).\n- Head is at (3,5), which is not adjacent to (2,2). So, no immediate danger from tail food.\n\n### Evaluating Best Move\n\nSince none of the food can be reached this turn (both will disappear after this turn), our priority is to move safely without colliding and possibly position ourselves for future food.\n\nPossible moves: U, L, R.\n\n- U: (3,6) - safe, no food.\n- L: (2,5) - safe, no food.\n- R: (4,5) - safe, no food.\n\nAll three moves are safe with no immediate benefit. We can choose any, but let's think about future moves:\n\n- Moving Up (U) to (3,6): Next moves could be L to (2,6) or R to (4,6), but we're moving away from the center where food might spawn.\n- Moving Left (L) to (2,5): Next could be U to (2,6), D to (2,4), or L to (1,5) (but (1,5) has food disappearing this turn).\n- Moving Right (R) to (4,5): Next could be U to (4,6), D to (4,4), or R to (5,5). (4,4) is an internal obstacle, so D is blocked.\n\nMoving Right seems slightly better as it opens up more options next turn without immediate obstacles.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter evaluating all options, moving Right (R) seems like a safe choice that doesn't lead to any immediate dangers and keeps options open for future moves.\n\n\\boxed{R}",

Let's check possible moves considering:\n\n1. **Current Direction**: R.\n   - Cannot instantly reverse to L (from R to L is not allowed).\n   - Possible moves: U, D, R.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each possible move:\n\n#### 1. Move Right (R) to (5,5)\n- **Check for Walls**:\n  - (5,5) is not a border wall (x=7 is wall, x=5 is not).\n  - Internal obstacles: (5,6) is a wall, but (5,5) is not listed as a wall.\n- **Check for Body Collision**:\n  - Snake body segments: (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (2,3).\n  - (5,5) is not in the body segments.\n- **Food Check**:\n  - No food at (5,5).\n- **Conclusion**: Safe move, but no immediate reward.\n\n#### 2. Move Up (U) to (4,6)\n- **Check for Walls**:\n  - (4,6): y=6 is not a border wall (y=7 is).\n  - Internal obstacles: (5,6) is a wall, but (4,6) is not listed.\n- **Check for Body Collision**:\n  - (4,6) is not in the body segments.\n- **Food Check**:\n  - No food at (4,6).\n- **Conclusion**: Safe move, but no immediate reward.\n\n#### 3. Move Down (D) to (4,4)\n- **Check for Walls**:\n  - (4,4): internal obstacle listed at (4,4) — this is a wall.\n- **Conclusion**: Cannot move here; it's a wall.\n\n### Evaluating Food\n\nNow, let's look at the food positions:\n\n1. **Food at (1,5)**:\n   - Value: +1, life_span: 1 (will disappear after this turn).\n   - Distance from head (4,5):\n     - Manhattan distance: |4-1| + |5-5| = 3.\n     - To reach (1,5) from (4,5), need to move left three times: L, L, L.\n     - But current direction is R, and next move cannot be L (instant reverse).\n     - So, cannot reach (1,5) in one move; it's too far and will disappear next turn.\n   \n2. **Food at (1,1)**:\n   - Value: +9, life_span: 1 (will disappear after this turn).\n   - Distance from head (4,5):\n     - Manhattan distance: |4-1| + |5-1| = 3 + 4 = 7.\n     - Cannot reach in one move; will disappear next turn.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger Check\n\nThe rule states that if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\n- **Tail Position**: (2,3).\n- **Adjacent to Head (4,5)**:\n  - Adjacent means sharing a side, so Manhattan distance = 1.\n  - Distance between (4,5) and (2,3): |4-2| + |5-3| = 2 + 2 = 4.\n  - Not adjacent (distance > 1), so no danger from tail food.\n\n### Deciding the Best Move\n\nGiven that both foods will disappear next turn and are unreachable in one move, our priority is to avoid collisions and stay alive while positioning for potential future food.\n\nPossible moves:\n- R to (5,5): Safe, no reward.\n- U to (4,6): Safe, no reward.\n- D to (4,4): Wall, invalid.\n- L: Instant reverse, invalid.\n\nBetween R and U:\n- Moving R continues the current direction, which might be preferable unless there's a reason to turn.\n- Moving U could be exploring new areas, but currently, no immediate benefit.\n\nSince both are safe and no immediate reward is available, moving R seems slightly better as it continues the current path without unnecessary turns.\n\n### Checking for Future Moves After R to (5,5)\n\nAfter moving to (5,5), next possible moves (from R direction):\n- Cannot go L (reverse).\n- Can go U, D, or R.\n\nLooking ahead:\n- U to (5,6): (5,6) is a wall — invalid.\n- D to (5,4): Check if wall or body:\n  - (5,4): Not listed as wall; not in current body (body will move as snake moves).\n- R to (6,5): Check walls:\n  - (6,5): Not border wall; internal obstacle at (6,3), not (6,5).\n\nSo, after R to (5,5), can choose D or R next turn, which seems safe.\n\n### Alternative: Moving U to (4,6)\n\nAfter U to (4,6), next possible moves (from U direction):\n- Cannot go D (reverse).\n- Can go L, R, or U.\n- U to (4,7): y=7 is border wall — invalid.\n- L to (3,6): Check walls:\n  - (3,6): Not listed as wall.\n- R to (5,6): (5,6) is wall — invalid.\n\nSo, only L is safe next move from (4,6).\n\nThis seems more restrictive than moving R to (5,5).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGiven that moving R to (5,5) keeps more options open for the next move and is safe, and moving U leads to a more restrictive path next turn, the better immediate action is to move R.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{R}",

        "thinking": "Alright, let's tackle this Snake game scenario step by step. I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to take at turn \\( t_0 = 18 \\).\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\nFirst, let's summarize the given information:\n\n1. **Grid Size**: The grid is 8x8 (since x and y range from 0 to 7).\n2. **Walls**:\n   - **Border Walls**: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (so the snake can't go beyond these coordinates).\n   - **Internal Obstacles**: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3). These are cells the snake cannot move into.\n3. **Snake Positions**: \n   - Head: (5,5)\n   - Body segments: (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3)\n   - So the snake's length is 5.\n4. **Snake Head Direction**: Currently moving Right (R).\n5. **Food**:\n   - Only one food item: at (1,1) with value=1 (positive food), life_span=9, countdown=1 (since life_span is 9 and it's at turn 18, assuming it appeared at turn 10, so it disappears at turn 19).\n\n### Visualizing the Snake and Food\n\nLet me visualize the snake's position and the food:\n\n- Snake:\n  - Head at (5,5)\n  - Next at (4,5)\n  - Then (3,5)\n  - Then (3,4)\n  - Tail at (3,3)\n  \n- Food at (1,1), which is positive and will disappear next turn (turn 19).\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (5,5) moving Right (R), the possible moves are:\n\n1. **Up (U)**: (5,6)\n   - Check if (5,6) is valid:\n     - Not a wall: x=5 is not a border wall, y=6 is not a border wall (since y=7 is the border).\n     - Not an internal obstacle: (5,6) is listed as an internal obstacle → **Invalid**.\n   \n2. **Down (D)**: (5,4)\n   - Check (5,4):\n     - Not a border wall.\n     - Not in internal obstacles list.\n     - Not part of the snake's body except possibly the tail, but tail is at (3,3).\n     - **Valid**.\n   \n3. **Left (L)**: (4,5)\n   - Check (4,5):\n     - Not a wall.\n     - It's the first body segment after the head → moving left would make the head collide with the body immediately → **Invalid** (body collision).\n   \n4. **Right (R)**: (6,5)\n   - Check (6,5):\n     - Not a border wall (x=7 is border, so x=6 is okay).\n     - Not in internal obstacles.\n     - Not part of the snake's body.\n     - **Valid**.\n\nSo, the valid moves from current position and direction are Down (D) and Right (R).\n\n### Considering Food\n\nThere's positive food at (1,1) with countdown=1 (will disappear next turn). \n\nCurrent head is at (5,5). Distance to food is |5-1| + |5-1| = 4 + 4 = 8 cells away. \n\nGiven that the snake moves one cell per turn, it's impossible to reach the food at (1,1) in this turn (turn 18) since it's 8 cells away and the food disappears at turn 19 (next turn). \n\nTherefore, the food at (1,1) is unreachable in the current turn, so we can ignore it for this decision.\n\n### Evaluating Valid Moves\n\nNow, between the two valid moves: Down (D) to (5,4) and Right (R) to (6,5).\n\nLet's see where each move takes us and what the future possibilities might be.\n\n1. **Move Right (R) to (6,5)**:\n   - New head: (6,5)\n   - Body follows: (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4)\n   - Tail (3,3) moves away, so length increases if we eat food, but no food is eaten here.\n   - Next possible moves from (6,5):\n     - Current direction is R, so can't move L (opposite).\n     - U: (6,6) - check:\n       - y=6 is not border, x=6 not border.\n       - Not in internal obstacles.\n       - Not in new body positions: (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4) → (6,6) is clear.\n       - Valid.\n     - D: (6,4) - check:\n       - Not border.\n       - Not in internal obstacles.\n       - Not in body.\n       - Valid.\n     - R: (7,5) - check:\n       - x=7 is border → **Invalid**.\n     So next moves would be U or D.\n\n2. **Move Down (D) to (5,4)**:\n   - New head: (5,4)\n   - Body: (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4)\n   - Tail (3,3) moves away.\n   - Next possible moves from (5,4), current direction is D (since we moved D from R, but direction is now D? Wait, direction is the last move, so after moving D, direction is D.\n     - Can't move U (opposite).\n     - L: (4,4) - check:\n       - Internal obstacle at (4,4) → **Invalid**.\n     - R: (6,4) - check:\n       - Not border.\n       - Not in internal obstacles.\n       - Not in body.\n       - Valid.\n     - D: (5,3) - check:\n       - Not border.\n       - Not in internal obstacles (internal obstacles are at (6,3), not (5,3)).\n       - Not in body.\n       - Valid.\n     So next moves would be R or D.\n\n### Choosing Between D and R\n\nBoth moves seem safe in the immediate turn. Let's see if one leads to a potential trap or more options later.\n\n- Moving R to (6,5):\n  - Next moves U or D.\n  - U to (6,6): then next moves could be U (to (6,7) which is border), L (to (5,6) which is obstacle), R (to (7,6) border) → only D is possible, but that's back to (6,5), which is body now → could be limiting.\n  - D to (6,4): then next moves could be L (to (5,4)), R (to (7,4) border), D (to (6,3) which is obstacle) → only L is possible, but (5,4) is body now → also limiting.\n\n- Moving D to (5,4):\n  - Next moves R or D.\n  - R to (6,4): then next moves could be U (to (6,5)), D (to (6,3) obstacle), R (to (7,4) border) → only U is possible, but (6,5) is body now → limiting.\n  - D to (5,3): then next moves could be L (to (4,3)), R (to (6,3) obstacle), D (to (5,2)) → L and D possible. More options.\n\nMoving D seems to give slightly more options in the next step compared to R, where both immediate next steps after R seem to lead to more constrained positions.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Dangers\n\nAlso, need to ensure that moving D doesn't lead to immediate danger next turn.\n\nAfter moving D to (5,4), body is (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4). Tail was at (3,3), which moves away, so no new tail collision.\n\nSimilarly, moving R to (6,5), body is (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4). Tail moves away, no collision.\n\nBoth are safe in that regard.\n\n### Decision\n\nGiven that the food is unreachable this turn, and both D and R are safe, but D seems to offer slightly more flexibility in the next move, I'll choose to move Down.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{D}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**Current Turn:** 19  \n**Walls:**\n- Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (so the grid is 8x8 from (0,0) to (7,7))\n- Internal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3)\n\n**Snake Positions:**\n- Head: (5,4)\n- Body segments: (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4)\n  \nSo, the snake's body is:\n- (5,4) - head\n- (5,5)\n- (4,5)\n- (3,5)\n- (3,4) - tail\n\n**Snake Head Direction:** D (Down, which is decreasing y-coordinate)\n\n**Food:**\n1. (1,1) - value: 8, life_span: 1\n2. (2,3) - value: 10, life_span: 1\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However, since the current direction is Down, the snake cannot instantly reverse to Up (that would be illegal). So, possible moves are Down, Left, or Right.\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n#### 1. Move Down (D)\n- Current head: (5,4)\n- New head position: (5,3) (since Down decreases y by 1)\n\nCheck for collisions:\n- Walls: y=0 is a wall, but (5,3) is not on y=0.\n- Internal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3) — (5,3) is not in this list.\n- Body collision: Snake body segments are at (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4). (5,3) is not in these.\n\nSo, moving Down is safe in terms of collisions.\n\nNow, check for food:\n- Food at (1,1) and (2,3). (5,3) is not a food position.\n  \nSo, moving Down is safe but doesn't eat any food.\n\n#### 2. Move Left (L)\n- Current head: (5,4)\n- New head position: (4,4)\n\nCheck for collisions:\n- Walls: Not on borders.\n- Internal obstacles: (4,4) is an internal obstacle! So, moving Left would collide with the obstacle.\n  \nSo, moving Left is not safe.\n\n#### 3. Move Right (R)\n- Current head: (5,4)\n- New head position: (6,4)\n\nCheck for collisions:\n- Walls: x=7 is a wall, (6,4) is not on x=7.\n- Internal obstacles: (6,3) is an obstacle, but (6,4) is not.\n- Body collision: Snake body is at (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4). (6,4) is not in these.\n\nSo, moving Right is safe in terms of collisions.\n\nCheck for food:\n- Food at (1,1) and (2,3). (6,4) is not a food position.\n\nSo, moving Right is safe but doesn't eat any food.\n\n### Evaluating Food Options\n\nBoth food items have a life_span of 1, meaning they will disappear after this turn if not eaten. \n\nLet's see if we can reach any food this turn:\n\n1. Food at (1,1):\n   - Distance from head (5,4): |5-1| + |4-1| = 4 + 3 = 7 steps away. Can't reach in one move.\n\n2. Food at (2,3):\n   - Distance from head (5,4): |5-2| + |4-3| = 3 + 1 = 4 steps away. Can't reach in one move.\n\nSo, we cannot eat any food this turn regardless of our move.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger\n\nWe need to check if the head is adjacent to the tail and if the tail cell has positive food.\n\n- Tail is at (3,4).\n- Adjacent cells to tail: (2,4), (4,4), (3,3), (3,5).\n- Head is at (5,4). Is (5,4) adjacent to (3,4)? \n  - Distance: |5-3| + |4-4| = 2 + 0 = 2. Not adjacent (adjacent means distance of 1).\n\nSo, no tail reward danger here.\n\n### Best Move\n\nFrom the possible safe moves (Down and Right), neither leads to eating food this turn. Both are equally safe in terms of not colliding. \n\nNow, let's think about future moves:\n\n- Moving Down to (5,3):\n  - Next possible moves from (5,3): Can't go Up (reverse of Down), so Left, Right, or Down.\n  - Down to (5,2): safe unless there's an obstacle.\n  - Left to (4,3): need to check obstacles.\n  - Right to (6,3): (6,3) is an obstacle, so not safe.\n\n- Moving Right to (6,4):\n  - Next possible moves from (6,4): Can't go Left (reverse of Right), so Up, Down, or Right.\n  - Right to (7,4): x=7 is a wall, so not safe.\n  - Up to (6,5): need to check obstacles.\n  - Down to (6,3): (6,3) is an obstacle, so not safe.\n\nBetween Down and Right, moving Down seems slightly better because from (5,3), we have two possible safe moves next (Down to (5,2) or Left to (4,3)), whereas from (6,4), only Up to (6,5) is safe next.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter evaluating all options, the safest move that keeps future options open is **Down**.\n\n\\boxed{D}",

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State\n\nFirst, let's visualize the current state based on the provided information.\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The grid is 8x8 (from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7).\n2. **Walls**:\n   - **Border Walls**: All cells where x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7 are walls.\n   - **Internal Obstacles**: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3).\n3. **Snake**:\n   - Positions (head first): [(5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5)].\n   - Current head direction: Down (D).\n4. **Food**:\n   - (1,1): value=7, life_span=1.\n   - (2,3): value=9, life_span=1.\n\n### Visualizing the Snake and Food\n\nLet's plot the snake and food on the grid:\n\n- **Snake**:\n  - Head: (5,3)\n  - Body: (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5)\n  \n  The snake is moving Down (D), meaning it's moving in the negative y-direction. The next position from the head (5,3) moving Down would be (5,2).\n\n- **Food**:\n  - (1,1): Positive food (value=7), life_span=1 (will disappear next turn).\n  - (2,3): Positive food (value=9), life_span=1 (will disappear next turn).\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (5,3) and direction D, the possible moves are:\n\n1. **Continue Down (D)**: (5,2)\n   - Check if (5,2) is valid:\n     - Not a wall: x=5 is not 0 or 7; y=2 is not 0 or 7.\n     - Not an internal obstacle: (5,2) is not in [(5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3)].\n     - Not colliding with body: Snake body is at (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5). (5,2) is not in these.\n     - Valid move.\n\n2. **Turn Left (L)**: (4,3)\n   - Current direction is D, so left is relative to down, which is right in standard orientation (but need to confirm).\n   - Actually, if facing down (negative y), left is decreasing x, right is increasing x.\n   - So Left from D is (x-1,y) = (4,3).\n   - Check (4,3):\n     - Not a wall.\n     - Not an internal obstacle.\n     - Not in body: (4,3) vs [(5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5)] — no.\n     - Valid.\n\n3. **Turn Right (R)**: (6,3)\n   - Right from D is (x+1,y) = (6,3).\n   - Check (6,3):\n     - Internal obstacle at (6,3) — cannot move here.\n\nSo possible moves: D to (5,2), L to (4,3). R is invalid.\n\n### Checking for Food\n\nNow, let's see if moving to any of these positions eats food:\n\n1. **Down to (5,2)**:\n   - Food at (1,1) and (2,3) — neither is (5,2).\n   - No food eaten.\n\n2. **Left to (4,3)**:\n   - No food at (4,3).\n   - No food eaten.\n\nNeither immediate move eats food. However, we should consider future moves to see if one direction leads us closer to food.\n\n### Evaluating Paths to Food\n\nFood positions:\n- (1,1): Manhattan distance from head (5,3) is |5-1| + |3-1| = 4 + 2 = 6.\n- (2,3): |5-2| + |3-3| = 3 + 0 = 3.\n\nClosest food is at (2,3), distance 3.\n\nPaths to (2,3):\nFrom (5,3), need to go left (decrease x) by 3 to reach x=2, and no change in y.\n\nPossible sequence: L to (4,3), then L to (3,3), then L to (2,3).\n\nBut need to check if these moves are safe:\n\n- After first L to (4,3):\n  - Next moves from (4,3):\n    - Current direction is L (since we turned left from D, now moving left).\n    - Possible moves:\n      - Continue L: (3,3)\n      - Turn 'left' from L is U (relative to left is up): (4,4)\n      - Turn 'right' from L is D: (4,2)\n    - Check (3,3):\n      - Not wall, not obstacle, not body (current body will have moved: original body was [(5,4),(5,5),(4,5),(3,5)], after moving head to (4,3), body is [(5,3),(5,4),(5,5),(4,5)] — (3,3) not in this.\n      - Safe.\n    - Then to (2,3):\n      - From (3,3), continue L to (2,3):\n        - Not wall, not obstacle, body will be [(4,3),(5,3),(5,4),(5,5)] — (2,3) not in this.\n        - Safe.\n      - Can reach (2,3) in 3 moves.\n\nAlternative path: D to (5,2), then L to (4,2), then L to (3,2), then U to (3,3), then L to (2,3) — longer.\n\nSo initial L seems better for reaching (2,3).\n\n### Checking for Immediate Dangers\n\nIs there any immediate danger in moving L to (4,3)?\n\n- Current body: [(5,4),(5,5),(4,5),(3,5)].\n- After moving to (4,3), new body: [(5,3),(5,4),(5,5),(4,5)].\n- Tail is at (4,5), which is not adjacent to new head (4,3) (distance is |4-4| + |5-3| = 2, not adjacent).\n- No food under tail to worry about \"Tail Reward Danger\".\n\nSimilarly, moving D to (5,2):\n- New body: [(5,3),(5,4),(5,5),(4,5)].\n- Tail at (4,5), distance to head (5,2) is |5-4| + |2-5| = 1 + 3 = 4, not adjacent.\n- Safe.\n\n### Considering Food Lifespan\n\nBoth foods have life_span=1, meaning they will disappear next turn (t=21). So we cannot reach them in this turn (t=20), but can we position ourselves to reach them next turn?\n\nNo, because even if we move towards them, they'll disappear before we can eat them. So immediate food is not a factor this turn.\n\n### Deciding the Move\n\nSince neither move leads to eating food this turn (and food will disappear next turn), we should choose a move that keeps us safe and possibly positions us better for future food spawns.\n\nOptions:\n1. D to (5,2):\n   - Moves away from current body.\n   - Next turn from (5,2), possible moves: L to (4,2), R to (6,2) (but (6,3) is obstacle, (6,2) is not wall or obstacle), or continue D to (5,1) (but y=1 is safe, but y=0 is wall, so can go to (5,1) next).\n   \n2. L to (4,3):\n   - Moves left, towards where food was (but it's disappearing).\n   - Next turn from (4,3), can go L to (3,3), U to (4,4) (but (4,4) is obstacle), or D to (4,2).\n\nBoth moves seem safe. Moving D keeps us in a more central position, while L moves us left where there might be more space.\n\nGiven that moving L could help in exploring more of the grid, and both moves are safe, L might be slightly better for future flexibility.\n\nHowever, moving D keeps us aligned with the current direction, avoiding unnecessary turns which might be simpler.\n\nGiven that both are safe and no immediate food to eat, either is acceptable. I'll choose L to start moving towards the left side where there might be more open space.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter considering all factors, the safest and most strategic immediate action is to move Left (L).\n\n\\boxed{L}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**Current Turn (t₀):** 22\n\n**Walls:**\n- Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (so the grid is 8x8 from (0,0) to (7,7))\n- Internal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3)\n\n**Snake:**\n- Positions (head first): [(3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5)]\n- Current head direction: Left (L)\n\n**Food:**\n1. (1,1): value=5, life_span=1\n2. (2,3): value=7, life_span=1\n3. (5,4): value=10, life_span=1\n\n### Visualizing the Snake and Food\n\nLet's visualize the snake's body and the food positions.\n\n- Snake:\n  - Head: (3,3)\n  - Body: (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5) (tail)\n  \nSo the snake is currently moving left (from (4,3) to (3,3)).\n\nFood:\n- (1,1): positive food (value=5)\n- (2,3): positive food (value=7)\n- (5,4): positive food (value=10) — but this is currently under the snake's body segment (5,4)\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (3,3) and direction L (left), the possible next moves are:\n\n1. **Continue Left (L):** (2,3)\n   - Check if (2,3) is valid:\n     - Not a wall: (2,3) is not in the wall list.\n     - Not part of the body except possibly the tail:\n       - Snake body: (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5) — none are (2,3), so safe.\n     - Food at (2,3): value=7, life_span=1\n     - After moving, the tail moves from (5,5) to (5,4), so the new tail is (5,4).\n     - Is (2,3) adjacent to the new tail (5,4)? \n       - Distance: |2-5| + |3-4| = 3 + 1 = 4, not adjacent (adjacent means distance=1).\n     - So eating is safe.\n\n2. **Turn Up (U):** (3,4)\n   - Check (3,4):\n     - Walls: not listed.\n     - Body parts: none at (3,4).\n     - Food: none at (3,4).\n     - Safe move, but no immediate reward.\n\n3. **Turn Down (D):** (3,2)\n   - Check (3,2):\n     - Walls: not listed.\n     - Body parts: none at (3,2).\n     - Food: none at (3,2).\n     - Safe move, but no immediate reward.\n\n4. **Reverse Right (R):** (4,3)\n   - Current direction is L, so R is opposite.\n   - Rule: No instant reverse. So cannot go R.\n\nSo possible actions: L, U, D.\n\n### Evaluating Possible Moves\n\n**Option 1: Left (L) to (2,3)**\n- Eats food at (2,3): value=7, life_span=1.\n- Snake grows by 1: new head at (2,3), body becomes [(2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4)] (tail is (5,4)).\n- Score increases by 7.\n- Check if next move is safe:\n  - From (2,3), possible moves:\n    - L: (1,3) — check walls: not listed; body: none; food: none.\n    - U: (2,4) — check walls: not listed; body: none; food: none.\n    - D: (2,2) — check walls: not listed; body: none; food: none.\n  - Seems safe for next move.\n\n**Option 2: Up (U) to (3,4)**\n- No food eaten.\n- Snake moves: head to (3,4), tail moves from (5,5) to (5,4).\n- New positions: [(3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4)].\n- Next moves from (3,4):\n  - U: (3,5) — check: no walls, no body, no food.\n  - L: (2,4) — wall at (2,4)? Internal obstacles include (2,4), so cannot go L.\n  - R: (4,4) — wall at (4,4), so cannot go R.\n  - D: (3,3) — but current body is (3,3), so would collide next turn unless tail moves.\n     - After this move, tail is at (5,4), next move D to (3,3), then tail moves to (5,3), so no collision.\n     - But seems risky as options are limited next turn.\n\n**Option 3: Down (D) to (3,2)**\n- No food eaten.\n- Snake moves: head to (3,2), tail to (5,4).\n- New positions: [(3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4)].\n- Next moves from (3,2):\n  - D: (3,1) — no walls, no body, no food.\n  - L: (2,2) — no walls, no body, no food.\n  - R: (4,2) — no walls, no body, no food.\n  - U: (3,3) — body at (3,3), but tail is at (5,4), so next turn tail moves to (5,3), so (3,3) is safe.\n  - Seems safer than U, but still no immediate reward.\n\n### Considering Food Under Body\n\nThere's food at (5,4) which is currently under the snake's body.\n- To eat it:\n  - Need to move body away first, then head onto it.\n  - Currently, (5,4) is the 4th segment (from head: 0-head,1,2,3,4-tail).\n  - Next move if we go L: body becomes [(2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4)] — (5,4) is now tail.\n  - Then next turn, if we go R to (3,3), then D to (3,2), etc., but (5,4) is tail, so to eat it, head would have to go to (5,4) when tail moves away.\n  - Seems complicated and not immediately beneficial compared to eating (2,3).\n\n### Checking Immediate Rewards\n\n- Left (L): eat (2,3) for +7.\n- Up (U) or Down (D): no immediate reward.\n  \nGiven that the food at (2,3) has life_span=1, meaning it will disappear after this turn if not eaten now. The other foods:\n- (1,1): life_span=1 — will disappear after this turn.\n- (5,4): life_span=1 — under body, hard to eat immediately.\n\nSo the only immediately accessible and expiring food is at (2,3).\n\n### Potential Risks with Left Move\n\nIs there any risk in moving left to (2,3)?\n- Not colliding with body or walls.\n- After eating, new tail is at (5,4), head at (2,3).\n- Next turn, possible moves from (2,3):\n  - L: (1,3) — no issues.\n  - U: (2,4) — wall at (2,4), cannot go.\n  - D: (2,2) — safe.\n  - R: (3,3) — body is at (3,3), but tail is at (5,4), so next turn tail moves to (5,3), so (3,3) is safe.\n  \nSeems safe.\n\n### Alternative Considerations\n\nIs there a better long-term move than eating (2,3)?\n- Food at (1,1) is also expiring, but it's far and not reachable this turn.\n- Food at (5,4) is under body and not immediately accessible.\n- Moving U or D doesn't provide immediate benefit and may limit future options.\n\n### Decision\n\nThe best immediate action is to move Left (L) to (2,3) to eat the positive food there, gaining +7 points, with no immediate risks.\n\n\\boxed{L}",

        "thinking": "Alright, let's tackle this Snake game scenario step by step. I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n1. **Current Turn**: 23\n2. **Walls**:\n   - **Border Walls**: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. This means the grid is 8x8 (from (0,0) to (7,7)), and the snake cannot go outside these bounds.\n   - **Internal Obstacles**: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3). These are additional walls inside the grid that the snake must avoid.\n3. **Snake Positions**: \n   - Head: (2, 3)\n   - Body: [(3, 3), (4, 3), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)]\n   - So, the snake is moving left (current direction is L), with its head at (2,3) and tail at (5,5).\n4. **Food**:\n   - (1, 1): value = 4, life_span = 1\n   - (5, 4): value = 9, value = 1 (Note: There seems to be a typo here; it's likely value = 9, life_span = 1)\n\n### Snake's Current Direction and Possible Moves\n\nCurrent direction is Left (L). From the head at (2,3), moving left would go to (1,3). \n\n**Possible Moves** (without considering constraints yet):\n- Up (U): (2,4)\n- Down (D): (2,2)\n- Left (L): (1,3) - current direction\n- Right (R): (3,3) - opposite of current direction\n\n**Movement Constraints**:\n- Cannot reverse direction instantly: So, cannot go Right (R) from Left (L).\n- Therefore, possible moves: U, D, L.\n\n### Checking Each Possible Move for Safety and Benefits\n\nLet's evaluate U, D, L one by one.\n\n#### 1. Move Up (U): (2,4)\n- New head position: (2,4)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: \n    - Border walls: y=7 is max, so y=4 is fine.\n    - Internal obstacles: (1,4), (2,4), (4,4) are walls. (2,4) is a wall! So, cannot move here.\n  - Body: \n    - Snake body segments: (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5). (2,4) is not in the body, but it's a wall, so invalid.\n- **Conclusion**: Cannot move Up.\n\n#### 2. Move Down (D): (2,2)\n- New head position: (2,2)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls:\n    - y=0 is min, y=2 is fine.\n    - Internal obstacles: (2,4) is a wall, but we're at (2,2), no overlap.\n  - Body:\n    - (2,2) is not in [(3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5)].\n  - Also, tail is at (5,5), so no immediate collision with tail.\n- Check for food:\n  - Food at (1,1) and (5,4). (2,2) is not a food position.\n- **Conclusion**: Safe to move Down, but no food eaten.\n\n#### 3. Move Left (L): (1,3)\n- New head position: (1,3)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls:\n    - x=0 is min, x=1 is fine.\n    - Internal obstacles: (1,4) is a wall, but we're at (1,3), no overlap.\n  - Body:\n    - (1,3) is not in the body segments.\n- Check for food:\n  - Food at (1,1) and (5,4). (1,3) is not a food position.\n- **Conclusion**: Safe to move Left, but no food eaten.\n\n### Considering Food\n\nNow, let's look at the food:\n\n1. (1,1): value = 4, life_span = 1\n   - Distance from head (2,3): |2-1| + |3-1| = 1 + 2 = 3 (Manhattan distance)\n   - Life_span is 1, so it will disappear after this turn if not eaten.\n   - To eat it, need to reach (1,1) next turn, but from (2,3), can't reach in one move (would need two moves: e.g., Left then Down).\n   - So, cannot eat this food this turn.\n\n2. (5,4): value = 9, life_span = 1\n   - Currently under the snake's body at (5,4) (which is part of the snake's body).\n   - From the rules: Food under the body can only be eaten if:\n     - The body moves away (i.e., the segment at (5,4) moves), and\n     - The head moves onto the food cell (i.e., head moves to (5,4)).\n   - Current body segment after head is (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5).\n   - If we move Left or Down, the tail (5,5) moves to (5,4), so (5,4) is still occupied by the snake (now by the new tail), so the food is still under the body.\n   - To have the body move away from (5,4), the tail must move away from (5,4). Currently, tail is at (5,5), moving to (5,4) next unless we change direction to move the tail differently.\n   - To eat (5,4), the head would need to move to (5,4) when it's not occupied by the body. But currently, (5,4) is occupied, and moving the snake won't free it up this turn because the tail is moving into it.\n   - Also, even if we could, the head is at (2,3), and (5,4) is too far to reach in one move (would need to move Right then Up, but can't reverse direction to Right from Left).\n   - **Conclusion**: Cannot eat (5,4) this turn.\n\n### Tail Reward Danger\n\nFrom the rules:\n- If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n- Current tail is at (5,5), with no food there (food is at (5,4), which is adjacent to tail but not on the tail.\n- So, no danger from this rule currently.\n\n### Best Move Decision\n\nFrom the possible safe moves:\n- Down (D): (2,2) - safe, no food\n- Left (L): (1,3) - safe, no food\n\nBoth moves are safe but don't eat food. Since (1,1) is disappearing next turn and we can't reach it, and (5,4) is also disappearing but can't be eaten, the immediate goal is to stay alive and position for future food.\n\nBetween Down and Left:\n- Moving Left continues in the current direction, which might be preferable unless there's a reason to change.\n- Moving Down could start turning the snake to explore more of the grid, but with walls nearby, it's not clear which is better.\n\nGiven that moving Left keeps the snake moving towards the left side where there might be more space (since right side has more body and obstacles), and moving Down might lead towards the bottom wall, Left seems slightly better to keep options open.\n\nHowever, looking at the walls and snake body:\n- Moving Left to (1,3):\n  - Next moves from (1,3): can't go Right (reverse), so U, D, L.\n  - Up to (1,4): but (1,4) is a wall.\n  - Down to (1,2): safe.\n  - Left to (0,3): x=0 is a wall, so can't.\n  - So from (1,3), only Down is possible next turn, which might corner us.\n\nMoving Down to (2,2):\n- Next moves from (2,2): can't go Up (reverse), so D, L, R.\n  - Down to (2,1): safe.\n  - Left to (1,2): safe.\n  - Right to (3,2): safe.\n  - More options next turn.\n\nTherefore, moving Down gives more flexibility next turn compared to moving Left.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter evaluating both options, moving Down seems better as it provides more flexibility for future moves without immediately cornering the snake.\n\n\\boxed{D}",

        "thinking": "Alright, let's tackle this Snake game scenario step by step. I'm going to analyze the current state of the game and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**Current Turn**: 24  \n**Walls**:\n- Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (so the grid is 8x8 from (0,0) to (7,7))\n- Internal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3)\n\n**Snake Positions**: [(2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4)]  \nThis means:\n- Head is at (2,2)\n- Body segments are at (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4)\n- Tail is at (5,4)\n\n**Snake Head Direction**: D (Down)  \nThis implies the snake was moving downward in the previous move (from (2,3) to (2,2)).\n\n**Food**:\n1. (1,1): value = 3, life_span = 1\n2. (5,4): value = 8, life_span = 1\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R). However, since the current direction is D (Down), the snake cannot instantly reverse to U (Up) in the next move. So, possible moves are D, L, R.\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n#### 1. Move Down (D) - (2,2) to (2,1)\n- New head position: (2,1)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: y=0 is a wall, (2,1) is not a wall (since y=0 is at y=0, and y=1 is above it)\n  - Body: Snake body segments are at (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4). (2,1) is not in this list.\n  - So, no collision.\n- Food at (2,1)? No food listed there.\n- After moving, the tail (5,4) moves forward, so the new body will be [(2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3)]\n  - The tail was at (5,4), which has food (5,4,8,1). If the head moves to (5,4), it would eat the food, but here we're moving to (2,1), so no.\n- This move is safe but doesn't eat any food.\n\n#### 2. Move Left (L) - (2,2) to (1,2)\n- New head position: (1,2)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: x=0 is a wall, (1,2) is not a wall.\n  - Internal obstacles: (1,4), (2,4), (4,4), (5,6), (6,3). (1,2) is not an obstacle.\n  - Body: (1,2) is not in [(2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4)].\n  - So, no collision.\n- Food at (1,2)? No food listed there.\n- After moving, the tail moves forward, new body: [(1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3)]\n- This move is safe but doesn't eat any food.\n\n#### 3. Move Right (R) - (2,2) to (3,2)\n- New head position: (3,2)\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: x=7 is far, no issue.\n  - Internal obstacles: (3,2) is not listed.\n  - Body: (3,2) is not in the body segments.\n  - So, no collision.\n- Food at (3,2)? No food listed there.\n- After moving, the tail moves forward, new body: [(3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3)]\n- This move is safe but doesn't eat any food.\n\n### Evaluating Food Options\n\nCurrently, there are two food items:\n1. (1,1): value = 3, life_span = 1\n   - Distance from head (2,2): Manhattan distance = |2-1| + |2-1| = 2\n   - To reach (1,1) from (2,2):\n     - First move: Left to (1,2)\n     - Next move: Down to (1,1)\n     - But life_span is 1, so it will disappear after this turn. Cannot reach in time.\n2. (5,4): value = 8, life_span = 1\n   - Currently, the tail is at (5,4), and the food is also at (5,4).\n   - According to the rules, food under the body can only be eaten if:\n     - The body moves away (tail moves from (5,4)), and\n     - The head moves onto (5,4).\n   - To eat this:\n     - The tail is at (5,4), which is the last segment. After any move, the tail will move forward:\n       - Current body: [(2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4)]\n       - After any move, the new tail will be (5,3), so (5,4) is no longer part of the body.\n     - Then, the head can move to (5,4) in the next move.\n     - But life_span is 1, so it will disappear after this turn. Cannot reach in time.\n   - Also, even if we could, the head is not adjacent to the tail (distance from (2,2) to (5,4) is |2-5| + |2-4| = 3 + 2 = 5, not adjacent), so the \"Tail Reward Danger\" doesn't apply here.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Food Consumption\n\nIs there any food that can be eaten immediately in the next move?\n- The head is at (2,2). Adjacent cells:\n  - Up (U): (2,3) - body segment, cannot eat (and reverse is not allowed)\n  - Down (D): (2,1) - no food\n  - Left (L): (1,2) - no food\n  - Right (R): (3,2) - no food\nSo, no immediate food to eat.\n\n### Considering Future Moves\n\nSince both foods will disappear after this turn (life_span=1), we can ignore them for future planning. The best move is to position the snake for potential future food spawns while avoiding collisions.\n\n### Choosing the Safest Move\n\nAll three possible moves (D, L, R) are safe in terms of not colliding with walls, obstacles, or the body. None of them lead to immediate food consumption.\n\nBetween D, L, R:\n- Moving Down (D) to (2,1): heads towards the bottom wall (y=0), which might limit future options.\n- Moving Left (L) to (1,2): heads towards the left wall (x=0), but still has space.\n- Moving Right (R) to (3,2): more central, keeps more options open.\n\nGiven that, moving Right seems the most flexible for future moves.\n\n### Verifying Tail Reward Danger\n\nIs there any risk with moving Right?\n- The tail is at (5,4), head is at (2,2), not adjacent.\n- After moving Right to (3,2), the new tail is at (5,3), still not adjacent to (3,2).\n- No risk of tail collision.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nSince all moves are safe and no immediate food can be eaten, the best choice is to move Right to keep more options open for future moves.\n\n\\boxed{R}",

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State\n\nFirst, let's visualize the current state of the game based on the provided information.\n\n**Grid Dimensions**: The grid is 8x8 (since x and y range from 0 to 7).\n\n**Walls**:\n- Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (i.e., the edges of the grid).\n- Internal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3).\n\n**Snake**:\n- Positions (head first): [(3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3)].\n  - Head at (3,2), direction is Right (R).\n  - Body segments: (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3).\n  - Tail is at (5,3).\n\n**Food**:\n1. (1,1): value = 1, life_span = 2.\n2. (5,4): value = 1, life_span = 7.\n3. (2,5): value = 1, life_span = 10.\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nThe snake's current direction is Right (R). From the head at (3,2), the possible moves are:\n\n- **Right (R)**: (4,2)\n- **Up (U)**: (3,3)\n- **Down (D)**: (3,1)\n\nCannot move Left (L) because it's the opposite of the current direction (Right).\n\nNow, let's evaluate each possible move for safety and potential rewards.\n\n#### 1. Move Right (R) to (4,2)\n\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: x=7 is a border wall, but (4,2) is not a wall.\n  - Body segments: Snake body is at [(2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3)]. (4,2) is not in this list, so no body collision.\n  \n- Food at (4,2)? No food listed there.\n  \n- Safe move with no immediate reward.\n\n#### 2. Move Up (U) to (3,3)\n\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: (3,3) is not a wall.\n  - Body segments: (3,3) is part of the body (4th segment). Moving here would collide with the body.\n  \n- **Dangerous**: Body collision.\n\n#### 3. Move Down (D) to (3,1)\n\n- Check for collisions:\n  - Walls: y=0 is a border wall, but (3,1) is not a wall.\n  - Body segments: (3,1) is not in the body list.\n  \n- Food at (3,1)? No food listed there.\n  \n- Safe move with no immediate reward.\n\n### Evaluating Food\n\nNow, let's see if any food is reachable or worth targeting.\n\n1. **Food at (1,1)**:\n   - Current position: (3,2).\n   - To reach (1,1), need to move Left then Down or Down then Left.\n   - But current direction is Right, cannot move Left immediately.\n   - Life_span = 2, meaning it will disappear after 2 more turns (including current turn). It's risky to try to reach it in time.\n\n2. **Food at (5,4)**:\n   - From (3,2), could go Right to (4,2), then Up to (4,3), then Right to (5,3), then Up to (5,4).\n   - But (5,3) is the tail. Moving to (5,3) is safe because the tail will move away.\n   - However, after moving to (5,3), next move to (5,4) would be safe unless the tail moves in a way that causes collision, which seems unlikely based on current body positions.\n   - Life_span = 7, so plenty of time.\n\n3. **Food at (2,5)**:\n   - From (3,2), would need to go Left to (2,2), then Up to (2,3), then Up to (2,4), but (2,4) is a wall, so cannot go there.\n   - Alternative path not straightforward due to walls.\n   - Life_span = 10, so not urgent.\n\n### Potential Plan\n\nGiven the above, the most promising food is at (5,4). To reach it:\n\n1. Current position: (3,2), direction R.\n2. Move Right to (4,2).\n3. Next move could be Up to (4,3).\n4. Then Right to (5,3).\n5. Then Up to (5,4) to eat the food.\n\nBut we only decide the immediate action for the current turn.\n\n### Immediate Action Choices\n\nFrom current position (3,2), direction R:\n\n- **Right (R) to (4,2)**: Safe, no reward, but sets up path to (5,4).\n- **Down (D) to (3,1)**: Safe, no reward, but doesn't help in reaching food.\n- **Up (U) to (3,3)**: Deadly (body collision).\n\nBetween Right and Down, Right is better as it moves towards the food at (5,4).\n\n### Checking for Tail Reward Danger\n\nIs the head adjacent to the tail with positive food on the tail?\n\n- Tail is at (5,3).\n- Head is at (3,2). Distance to tail: |3-5| + |2-3| = 2 + 1 = 3. Not adjacent (adjacent would be distance 1).\n- So no tail reward danger.\n\n### Verifying No Immediate Reverse\n\nCurrent direction is R, so cannot move L (which is opposite). Moving R, U, or D is allowed.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe best immediate action is to move **Right (R)** to (4,2), which is safe and starts moving towards the food at (5,4).\n\n\\boxed{R}",

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State\n\nFirst, let's break down the current state of the game to understand where everything is positioned.\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, meaning the grid is 8x8 (from (0,0) to (7,7)).\n   \n2. **Internal Obstacles**: These are walls inside the grid where the snake cannot move:\n   - (5, 6)\n   - (1, 4)\n   - (4, 4)\n   - (2, 4)\n   - (6, 3)\n\n3. **Snake Positions**: The snake's body is represented as a list from head to tail:\n   - Head: (4, 2)\n   - Body segments: (3, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 3)\n   - So, the snake is 6 segments long.\n\n4. **Snake Head Direction**: Currently moving Right (R), meaning the last move was to the right (from (3,2) to (4,2)).\n\n5. **Food Items**: There are three food items with their positions, values, and remaining life spans:\n   - (1, 1): value = 1, life_span = 1\n   - (5, 4): value = 1, life_span = 6\n   - (2, 5): value = 1, life_span = 9\n\n### Visualizing the Grid\n\nTo better understand, let's sketch a simple representation of the grid with the snake and food positions.\n\n```\ny=7 +-----------------+\n    |                 |\n    |                 |\n    |                 |\n    |                 |\n    |                 |\n    |                 |\ny=2 |   S S S         |  Snake head at (4,2), body follows\n    |     S S S       |\n    |                 |\ny=0 +-----------------+\n     x=0             x=7\n```\n\n- Snake head at (4,2), moving right (from (3,2)).\n- Food at (1,1), (5,4), (2,5).\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (4,2) and direction R, the possible next moves are:\n\n1. **Up (U)**: (4,3)\n   - Check if (4,3) is occupied by the snake's body or a wall.\n   - Snake body: (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3) — (4,3) is the tail.\n   - Moving to the tail is generally safe because the tail will move away, but we must check if there's food there that could cause a collision after growth.\n   - No food is at (4,3) currently (from the food list).\n   - So, moving U to (4,3) is safe.\n\n2. **Down (D)**: (4,1)\n   - Check walls: y=0 is a wall, but (4,1) is not a wall.\n   - Snake body: (4,1) is not in the body segments.\n   - No food at (4,1).\n   - So, moving D to (4,1) is safe.\n\n3. **Left (L)**: (3,2)\n   - Current direction is R, so L is the opposite direction.\n   - Rule: Cannot move opposite to current direction on the next turn.\n   - So, L is invalid.\n\n4. **Right (R)**: (5,2)\n   - Check walls: x=7 is a wall, (5,2) is not a wall.\n   - Internal obstacles: (5,6) is an obstacle, but not (5,2).\n   - Snake body: (5,2) is not in the body segments.\n   - No food at (5,2).\n   - So, moving R to (5,2) is safe.\n\n### Evaluating Food\n\nNow, let's see if any food is reachable or beneficial to go for:\n\n1. **(1,1)**: value=1, life_span=1 (will disappear after this turn)\n   - Distance from head (4,2):\n     - Manhattan distance: |4-1| + |2-1| = 3 + 1 = 4\n     - Cannot reach in one move; would need multiple moves.\n     - Since life_span=1, it will disappear after this turn, so not reachable.\n\n2. **(5,4)**: value=1, life_span=6\n   - Distance: |4-5| + |2-4| = 1 + 2 = 3\n   - Can't reach in one move, but could plan to move towards it.\n   - Current move options towards it:\n     - To decrease x from 4 to 5: need to move R to (5,2).\n     - Then next move would be U to (5,3), then U to (5,4).\n     - But need to check if (5,3) is safe:\n       - Walls: no\n       - Obstacles: (6,3) is an obstacle, but (5,3) is not listed.\n       - Snake body: need to see future positions, but likely safe.\n\n3. **(2,5)**: value=1, life_span=9\n   - Distance: |4-2| + |2-5| = 2 + 3 = 5\n   - Further away, life_span is longer, can consider later.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Food\n\nIs any food adjacent to the head that can be eaten this turn?\n\nAdjacent cells to head (4,2):\n\n- U: (4,3) — tail is here, but no food.\n- D: (4,1) — no food.\n- L: (3,2) — body segment, cannot move there (opposite direction also).\n- R: (5,2) — no food.\n\nNo immediate food to eat this turn.\n\n### Avoiding Tail Reward Danger\n\nSpecial case: If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake.\n\nCurrent tail is at (4,3). Adjacent to head (4,2)? Yes, (4,3) is above (4,2).\n\nIs there food at (4,3)? No, from the food list.\n\nSo no danger from tail reward this turn.\n\n### Choosing the Best Move\n\nFrom safe moves: U, D, R.\n\nWhich one is best strategically?\n\n1. **U (4,3)**:\n   - Moves onto the tail's current position.\n   - Tail will move away, so no collision.\n   - No food there, so no growth.\n   - After move, head at (4,3), tail was at (4,3), so new tail will be the previous segment (3,3).\n   - Next turn, cannot move D (opposite of U), but can move L, R, or U again.\n\n2. **D (4,1)**:\n   - Moves away from current body.\n   - No immediate benefit, but opens space.\n   - Next turn can move L, R, or D (not U opposite).\n\n3. **R (5,2)**:\n   - Moves towards the food at (5,4).\n   - Next move could be U to (5,3), then U to (5,4) to eat the food.\n   - Seems like a path towards positive food.\n\nBetween these, moving R seems the most proactive towards getting food at (5,4).\n\n### Verifying Move R to (5,2)\n\n- New head position: (5,2)\n- Snake body becomes: [(5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3)]\n   - Tail was (4,3), which moves away, so (3,3) is new tail.\n- Next turn, from (5,2), possible moves:\n   - U: (5,3) — check:\n     - Not a wall or obstacle.\n     - Not in new body: (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3)\n     - So safe.\n   - D: (5,1) — safe.\n   - L: (4,2) — body segment, but it's the segment after head, so would collide.\n     - Wait, no: the body after head is (4,2), so moving L to (4,2) would collide with the next segment.\n     - So L is invalid.\n   - R: (6,2) — check:\n     - x=6, y=2: is there a wall or obstacle?\n       - Border walls: x=7 is wall, x=6 is not.\n       - Internal obstacles: (6,3) is obstacle, but (6,2) is not.\n     - Not in body.\n     - So R is safe.\n\nFrom (5,2), next move can be U to (5,3), then U to (5,4) to eat food.\n\n### Alternative Move U to (4,3)\n\nIf we choose U:\n\n- New head: (4,3)\n- Body: [(4,3), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3)]\n   - Tail was (4,3), now moves to (3,3).\n- Next turn from (4,3), cannot move D (opposite of U), can move L to (3,3) — but that's the tail, which is safe unless food is there (no food at (3,3)).\n   - Moving L to (3,3): tail is at (3,3), so after move, tail moves to (2,3), head at (3,3), no collision.\n   - Then next move could be towards food at (2,5) by moving U to (3,4), etc.\n\nBut this seems less direct towards food compared to moving R.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe most promising immediate move is **R (Right)** to (5,2), which starts a path towards the food at (5,4). Other moves don't provide immediate benefits or lead towards food as directly.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{R}",

        "thinking": "Alright, let's tackle this Snake game scenario step by step. I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action to take at turn \\( t_0 = 27 \\).\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**1. Grid Dimensions and Walls:**\n- The grid is 8x8 (from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7).\n- Border walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So, we can't move outside these bounds.\n- Internal obstacles (walls) at: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3).\n\n**2. Snake:**\n- Positions (head first): [(5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3)].\n  - Head is at (5,2).\n  - Tail is at (3,3).\n- Current direction: R (right). So, the snake was moving to the right to reach (5,2) from (4,2).\n\n**3. Food:**\n- Two pieces:\n  - (5,4): value = +1, life_span = 6.\n  - (2,5): value = +1, life_span = 8.\n\n### Possible Moves from Current Position (5,2) with Current Direction R:\n\nFrom the head at (5,2), moving right (R) would take us to (6,2). But let's check all possible moves (U, D, L, R) considering:\n- No instant reverse: Current direction is R, so cannot move L (left) next.\n- Must avoid walls and body collisions (except tail under certain conditions).\n\n**Possible Directions: U, D, R (cannot go L due to no instant reverse).**\n\nLet's evaluate each:\n\n**1. Up (U): (5,2) → (5,3)**\n- Check for walls:\n  - (5,3): Not in internal obstacles list. Not a border wall (since y=3 is within 0-7).\n- Check for body collision:\n  - Snake body segments: (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3).\n  - (5,3) is not in the body, so safe.\n- Food at (5,3)? No, food is at (5,4) and (2,5).\n- So, moving U is safe but doesn't eat food.\n\n**2. Down (D): (5,2) → (5,1)**\n- Check walls:\n  - (5,1): Not in internal obstacles. y=1 is within bounds.\n- Body collision:\n  - (5,1) not in body segments.\n- Food at (5,1)? No.\n- Safe move, no food.\n\n**3. Right (R): (5,2) → (6,2)**\n- Check walls:\n  - (6,2): Not in internal obstacles. x=6 is within bounds (border is x=7).\n- Body collision:\n  - (6,2) not in body segments.\n- Food at (6,2)? No.\n- Safe move, no food.\n\n**4. Left (L): Not allowed (opposite of current direction R).**\n\n### Evaluating Food Options\n\nWe have two positive foods:\n1. (5,4): value +1, life_span 6.\n   - Distance from head (5,2): need to go up twice (to y=4).\n   - Current move U to (5,3), then next move could be U to (5,4).\n   - But need to ensure that after eating, the tail doesn't cause a collision.\n   - Current tail is at (3,3). After two moves (assuming no other body movement), tail would have moved forward, but need to see the entire path.\n\n2. (2,5): value +1, life_span 8.\n   - Distance from head (5,2): need to go left and up.\n   - More steps needed, life_span is longer (8 vs 6), but further away.\n\nGiven that both foods are positive and same value, closer one (5,4) seems more immediate.\n\n### Planning Path to (5,4):\n\nCurrent head at (5,2), direction R.\n\nMove sequence:\n1. U to (5,3).\n   - Snake becomes: [(5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3)].\n   - Tail moves from (3,3) to (2,3) (assuming body follows).\n2. Next move U to (5,4) to eat food.\n   - Snake would be: [(5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3)].\n   - Length increases by 1 (from 6 to 7).\n   - Need to check if new tail is at (2,3), and head at (5,4) is not adjacent to tail.\n   - Distance between (5,4) and (2,3) is more than 1, so safe.\n\nBut we're only deciding the immediate move at t=27, which is the first U to (5,3).\n\n### Checking for Immediate Dangers in Next Move\n\nAfter first move U to (5,3):\n- New head at (5,3).\n- Body segments: (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3).\n- Tail is at (2,3).\n- Is head adjacent to tail? (5,3) and (2,3): distance is 3 in x, 0 in y → not adjacent (must be exactly 1 cell away in x or y).\n- So no immediate danger.\n\n### Alternative Moves (D or R):\n\nIf we don't go U, alternatives are D or R:\n- D to (5,1): safe, no food.\n- R to (6,2): safe, no food.\n\nBut these don't progress towards food. (5,4) is closer with life_span 6, so better to start moving towards it.\n\n### Checking Tail Reward Danger for (5,4):\n\nWhen we reach (5,4) to eat:\n- Tail is at (2,3) (after two moves).\n- Head at (5,4) is not adjacent to (2,3), so no danger of collision after eating.\n\n### Is There Any Immediate Danger in Moving U?\n\nCurrent head at (5,2), moving U to (5,3):\n- Check if (5,3) is occupied by body: no, body is at (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3).\n- No walls at (5,3).\n- Not reversing direction (current is R, moving U is allowed).\n- So safe.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nBest immediate action is to start moving towards the closest positive food at (5,4) by moving Up (U).\n\n\\boxed{U}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n1. **Current Turn (t₀)**: 28\n2. **Walls**:\n   - **Border Cells**: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (so the grid is 8x8 from (0,0) to (7,7))\n   - **Internal Obstacles**: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3)\n3. **Snake Positions**: \n   - Head: (5,3)\n   - Body: [(5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3)]\n   - So the snake is 6 segments long.\n4. **Snake Head Direction**: Currently moving Up (U).\n5. **Food Items**:\n   - (5,4): value=1, life_span=5\n   - (2,5): value=1, life_span=7\n   - (1,3): value=1, life_span=10\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the current head position (5,3) moving Up (U), the possible next moves are:\n- **Up (U)**: (5,4) — current direction, can't reverse to Down (D) unless we change direction.\n- **Left (L)**: (4,3)\n- **Right (R)**: (6,3)\n\nBut we must check for:\n- Wall collisions.\n- Body collisions (except the tail, which moves away).\n- Food positions and their values.\n\n### Checking Each Possible Move\n\n1. **Move Up (U) to (5,4)**:\n   - Check walls: (5,4) is not a wall.\n   - Check body: Snake body is at [(5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3)]. (5,4) is not in the body.\n   - Food: (5,4) has positive food (value=1).\n     - Check Tail Reward Danger: The tail is at (2,3). Is (2,3) adjacent to (5,4)? \n       - Adjacent means same x and y differs by 1 or same y and x differs by 1.\n       - (5,4) and (2,3): x diff is 3, y diff is 1 → not adjacent (adjacent requires one diff to be 1 and the other 0).\n     - So no Tail Reward Danger.\n   - Safe to eat the food at (5,4).\n\n2. **Move Left (L) to (4,3)**:\n   - Check walls: (4,3) is not a wall.\n   - Check body: (4,3) is not in the body.\n   - Food: No food at (4,3).\n   - Safe move, but no immediate reward.\n\n3. **Move Right (R) to (6,3)**:\n   - Check walls: (6,3) is an internal obstacle (from the list).\n   - So this move would collide with a wall → deadly.\n\n### Evaluating Best Move\n\n- **Up (U)**: Eat positive food at (5,4), safe, increases length by 1.\n- **Left (L)**: Safe but no reward.\n- **Right (R)**: Deadly.\n\nBetween U and L, U is better because it gives a reward.\n\n### Checking for Other Considerations\n\n- **Food at (2,5) and (1,3)**: \n  - (2,5): Currently at (2,3), to reach (2,5), need to go Up twice, but there's an obstacle at (2,4).\n   - From (2,3), can't go Up to (2,4) because (2,4) is a wall.\n   - So can't reach (2,5) directly.\n  - (1,3): Currently at (5,3), to reach (1,3), need to go Left four times, but snake is long and path may be blocked by its own body or walls.\n   - Not immediately accessible.\n\n- **Tail Movement**:\n  - If we move Up to (5,4), the tail is at (2,3) and will move to (2,2) (since the body is [(5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2)] after head moves).\n   - No immediate collision risk.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe best immediate action is to move Up (U) to eat the positive food at (5,4), which is safe and beneficial.\n\n\\boxed{U}",

To reach (2,5), we'd need to go Left multiple times after moving Up or Right.\n   - Immediate moves don't reach it directly.\n\n2. **Food at (1,3)**:\n   - Currently at (5,4). (1,3) is near the tail at (2,3).\n   - To reach (1,3), we'd need to move Left multiple times, but it's adjacent to the tail.\n   - **Tail Reward Danger**: If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake.\n     - Currently, tail is at (2,3). Adjacent cells to tail are (1,3), (2,2), (2,4), (3,3).\n     - (1,3) is adjacent to tail and has positive food → Eating it is dangerous.\n     - So, we should avoid moving towards (1,3).\n\n### Checking for Immediate Food Consumption\n\nIs any food directly reachable in the next move?\n\n- Moving Up to (5,5): No food there.\n- Moving Right to (6,4): No food there.\n\nSo, no immediate food consumption in the next move.\n\n### Planning Ahead\n\nSince no food is immediately accessible, we should choose a move that keeps options open and avoids dead ends.\n\n- **Move Up (U)**:\n  - New head at (5,5).\n  - From (5,5), possible next moves:\n    - Up to (5,6): (5,6) is an internal obstacle → invalid.\n    - Left to (4,5): Need to check if (4,5) is safe.\n    - Right to (6,5): Need to check if (6,5) is safe.\n    - Down to (5,4): Reverse, invalid.\n  - So, from (5,5), can go Left or Right.\n\n- **Move Right (R)**:\n  - New head at (6,4).\n  - From (6,4), possible next moves:\n    - Up to (6,5): Need to check.\n    - Down to (6,3): (6,3) is an obstacle → invalid.\n    - Left to (5,4): Reverse, invalid.\n    - Right to (7,4): x=7 is a border wall → invalid.\n  - So, from (6,4), can only go Up.\n\nBetween U and R, moving Up seems better because it leaves two options (Left or Right) next turn, whereas moving Right only leaves one option (Up).\n\n### Checking for Future Food Access\n\nMoving Up to (5,5):\n\n- Then, can go Left to (4,5), then Left to (3,5), then Left to (2,5) to reach the food at (2,5).\n  - Need to ensure that by the time we reach (2,5), the food is still there (life_span=6, current turn=29).\n  - Assuming the food was just spawned, it will disappear at turn 35, so we have time.\n\nMoving Right to (6,4):\n\n- Then, must go Up to (6,5).\n  - From (6,5), options are Left to (5,5) or Right to (7,5) (invalid), so Left.\n  - This path seems less direct towards the food at (2,5).\n\n### Avoiding Dead Ends\n\nWe should also avoid getting stuck in corners or near walls where we might not have escape routes later.\n\n- Moving Up seems safe in this regard.\n- Moving Right leads to a position where next move is forced Up, which is less flexible.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nGiven the above analysis, the best immediate move is **Up (U)**, as it maintains flexibility and doesn't lead to immediate or future collisions, while also keeping the path to the food at (2,5) open.\n\n\\boxed{U}",

        "thinking": "Alright, let's break down the current state of the Snake game and decide on the best immediate action to take at Turn 30.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions and Walls**:\n   - The grid is 8x8 (from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7).\n   - Border walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.\n   - Internal obstacles at: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3).\n\n2. **Snake Details**:\n   - Positions (head first): [(5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2)].\n     - Head at (5,5), direction is Up (U).\n     - Tail at (2,2).\n   - Length: 7 segments.\n\n3. **Food Items**:\n   - (2,5): value=1, life_span=5.\n   - (1,3): value=1, life_span=8.\n\n### Possible Moves from Current Position (5,5) with Direction U (Up)\n\nFrom the current head position (5,5) and direction U, the possible moves are:\n- **Up (U)**: (5,6) \n  - Check if (5,6) is valid:\n    - (5,6) is an internal obstacle → **Invalid** (collision with wall).\n- **Left (L)**: (4,5)\n  - Check if (4,5) is valid:\n    - Not a wall or border.\n    - Not part of the snake's body except possibly the tail (but tail is at (2,2)).\n    - No instant reverse check: Current direction is U, moving L is not opposite (opposite would be D) → **Valid**.\n- **Right (R)**: (6,5)\n  - Check if (6,5) is valid:\n    - Not a border (x=7 is border, x=6 is fine).\n    - Not an internal obstacle (internal obstacles are at (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3) — (6,5) is not listed).\n    - Not part of the snake's body.\n    - No instant reverse → **Valid**.\n- **Down (D)**: (5,4)\n  - Check if (5,4) is valid:\n    - (5,4) is the second segment of the snake → **Invalid** (collision with body).\n\nSo, possible valid moves: Left (L) to (4,5) or Right (R) to (6,5).\n\n### Evaluating Food Options\n\nNow, let's see if either move can reach food:\n\n1. **Food at (2,5)**:\n   - Current head at (5,5). To reach (2,5), need to move left three times: (5,5)→(4,5)→(3,5)→(2,5).\n   - But food's life_span is 5, and it's turn 30. Assuming it appeared at turn 25, it will disappear at turn 30 (since countdown includes current turn). So it's still available this turn.\n   - However, moving left once to (4,5) doesn't reach it immediately. Would need a plan to reach it in future turns, but we're only deciding immediate action.\n\n2. **Food at (1,3)**:\n   - Current head at (5,5). To reach (1,3), need multiple moves, not reachable immediately.\n\nNeither food is reachable in the immediate next move, so the immediate goal is to move towards safety or position for future food collection.\n\n### Checking for Immediate Dangers\n\n- **Tail Reward Danger**: Check if the tail is adjacent to the head and has positive food.\n  - Tail is at (2,2), head at (5,5). Not adjacent (distance is |5-2| + |5-2| = 6), so no danger here.\n\n### Choosing Between L and R\n\nNow, between moving Left to (4,5) or Right to (6,5):\n\n1. **Left to (4,5)**:\n   - Next possible moves from (4,5):\n     - Current direction would be L (since we moved L from U).\n     - Possible next moves: L (from L is no instant reverse, so can't go R), so can go U, D, or L.\n     - U: (4,6) — check:\n       - Not a wall (internal walls: (5,6) is a wall, but (4,6) is not listed).\n       - Not part of snake's body.\n     - D: (4,4) — internal obstacle → invalid.\n     - L: (3,5) — valid.\n   - Future path seems open, especially towards (2,5) food.\n\n2. **Right to (6,5)**:\n   - Next possible moves from (6,5):\n     - Current direction would be R.\n     - Possible next moves: U, D, R (can't go L).\n     - U: (6,6) — not a wall, not in snake.\n     - D: (6,4) — not a wall, not in snake (but (6,3) is a wall, but (6,4) is fine).\n     - R: (7,5) — x=7 is border wall → invalid.\n   - Also seems safe, but doesn't lead directly towards food.\n\nBetween the two, moving Left seems slightly better as it starts moving towards the food at (2,5), which is about to disappear soon (this is its last turn), but we can't reach it immediately. However, moving Right doesn't offer a clear advantage either.\n\nBut wait, the food at (2,5) is at (2,5), and our snake's tail is at (2,2). The head is at (5,5), moving left to (4,5), then possibly (3,5), then (2,5). \n\nIs there a tail reward danger if we reach (2,5)?\n- Tail is at (2,2), food is at (2,5). When head moves to (2,5), tail will be at (3,2) (since the snake moves forward).\n- Distance between (2,5) and (3,2) is |2-3| + |5-2| = 1 + 3 = 4, not adjacent (adjacent is distance 1).\n- So no tail reward danger in this path.\n\nHowever, since the food at (2,5) will disappear after this turn (life_span=5, appearing at turn 25, disappears at turn 30), we can't reach it this turn, so it's not immediately relevant.\n\nGiven that, both L and R are safe, with no immediate food to collect. \n\nLooking at the snake's body:\n- Moving left to (4,5) is safe.\n- Moving right to (6,5) is also safe.\n\nPerhaps moving right is slightly better because:\n- Moving left would have the next move options towards the edge where the food is disappearing.\n- Moving right keeps more options open in the center.\n\nBut both seem equally safe. \n\nAlternatively, consider the snake's length is 7, and the grid is 8x8 with obstacles, so space is limited. Moving right might keep more space open.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nAfter considering both options, both Left and Right are safe with no immediate advantage. Since the food at (2,5) is about to disappear and we can't reach it this turn, and moving right keeps more central options open, I'll choose to move Right.\n\n\\boxed{R}",

I'm going to analyze the current state and determine the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**Current Turn**: 31  \n**Walls**:\n- Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (so the grid is 8x8 from (0,0) to (7,7))\n- Internal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3)\n\n**Snake Positions**:  \nHead at (6,5), then body segments at:  \n(5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2)  \nSo the snake is 7 segments long.\n\n**Snake Head Direction**: R (Right)  \nThis means the snake was moving to the right in the previous move.\n\n**Food**:\n1. (2,5): value=4, life_span=1\n2. (1,3): value=7, life_span=1\n3. (4,1): value=10, life_span=1\n\nWait a minute, the food format seems to be (x, y, value, life_span), but the given data is (x, y, life_span, value). Assuming the order is (x, y, value, life_span), let's correct that:\n1. (2,5): value=1, life_span=4\n2. (1,3): value=1, life_span=7\n3. (4,1): value=1, life_span=10\n\nAll foods are positive (+1 value).\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nThe snake can move in four directions: Up (U), Down (D), Left (L), Right (R).  \nCurrent direction is R, so we cannot instantly reverse to L (no instant reverse rule).\n\nSo possible moves: U, D, R\n\nNow, let's see where each move would take the head:\n\n1. **Right (R)**: (6,5) → (7,5)\n   - Check walls: x=7 is a border wall → collision → death\n   - Not a valid move.\n\n2. **Up (U)**: (6,5) → (6,6)\n   - Check walls: y=6 is not a wall (walls are at y=0 and y=7)\n   - Check obstacles: (6,6) is not in the internal obstacles list\n   - Check body: Snake body is at (5,5), (5,4), etc. (6,6) is not in the body\n   - Valid move.\n\n3. **Down (D)**: (6,5) → (6,4)\n   - Check walls: y=4 is not a wall\n   - Check obstacles: (6,4) is not in the internal obstacles list\n   - Check body: Snake body is at (5,5), (5,4), etc. (6,4) is not in the body\n   - Valid move.\n\nSo possible valid moves: U, D\n\n### Checking for Food\n\nNow, let's see if moving U or D leads to eating food.\n\n1. **Move U to (6,6)**:\n   - Is there food at (6,6)? No.\n   - So no food eaten.\n\n2. **Move D to (6,4)**:\n   - Is there food at (6,4)? Let's check food positions:\n     - (2,5), (1,3), (4,1) → no (6,4)\n   - So no food eaten.\n\nNeither U nor D directly leads to food. But let's think ahead: after moving, where can we go next to get food?\n\n### Planning Ahead\n\nCurrent head at (6,5). After move:\n\n1. **If U to (6,6)**:\n   - Next moves from (6,6): U (to (6,7) - wall), D (back to (6,5) - body), L (to (5,6)), R (to (7,6) - wall)\n   - Possible next moves: L\n   - Moving L to (5,6): check food - no, but (5,6) is an obstacle! So cannot move L next.\n   - So after U, next turn we'd be stuck (only can go D back to (6,5), which is body collision)\n   - Not a good path.\n\n2. **If D to (6,4)**:\n   - Next moves from (6,4): U (back to (6,5)), D (to (6,3)), L (to (5,4)), R (to (7,4) - wall)\n   - (6,3) is an obstacle, so cannot go D\n   - (5,4) is part of the body (snake is at ..., (5,4), ...) but the tail is at (3,2), so (5,4) is not the tail. Moving to body is death.\n   - So only possible next move is U back to (6,5), which is body collision\n   - Also seems stuck.\n\nHmm, both U and D seem to lead to dead ends next turn. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, when moving, the tail also moves forward. So the body segments shift.\n\nCurrent body: [(6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2)]\n\nAfter moving, the tail (last segment) is removed, and a new head is added at the move position.\n\n1. **Move U to (6,6)**:\n   - New head: (6,6)\n   - New body: [(6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2)]\n   - Tail was (3,2), now removed. So next turn, possible moves from (6,6):\n     - U to (6,7) - wall\n     - D to (6,5) - body (second segment)\n     - L to (5,6) - obstacle\n     - R to (7,6) - wall\n     - All moves lead to death next turn.\n\n2. **Move D to (6,4)**:\n   - New head: (6,4)\n   - New body: [(6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2)]\n   - Tail was (3,2), now removed. Next turn moves from (6,4):\n     - U to (6,5) - body (second segment)\n     - D to (6,3) - obstacle\n     - L to (5,4) - body (fourth segment)\n     - R to (7,4) - wall\n     - All moves lead to death next turn.\n\nThis seems like a no-win situation where any move leads to death next turn. But maybe there's a way to eat food to extend the snake and avoid this.\n\nWait, the only way to survive is to eat food to extend the snake, so the tail doesn't move, giving more space.\n\nBut currently, no move leads directly to food. However, food can be under the body if the body moves away and head moves onto it.\n\nCurrent food positions:\n1. (2,5)\n2. (1,3)\n3. (4,1)\n\nIs any food under the snake's body?\n\nSnake body positions:\n(6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2)\n\nFood at:\n- (2,5): not under body\n- (1,3): not under body\n- (4,1): not under body\n\nSo no food is under the body currently. Thus, no way to eat food this turn.\n\nGiven that, both U and D lead to death next turn. But maybe one is slightly better in some way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial assumption about food order was wrong. Maybe the food is (x,y, life_span, value). Then:\n\nFood:\n1. (2,5): life_span=4, value=1\n2. (1,3): life_span=7, value=1\n3. (4,1): life_span=10, value=1\n\nSame as before, all positive.\n\n### Re-evaluating Moves\n\nGiven that both U and D lead to death next turn, but we must choose one, perhaps choose the one that doesn't immediately die this turn.\n\nBut both U and D are valid this turn, but lead to death next turn. Maybe choose randomly, but since both are equally bad, perhaps U is slightly better because it moves towards the center (but not really).\n\nAlternatively, maybe the snake can survive longer by choosing D to (6,4), then next turn forced to U to (6,5), but (6,5) is now the second segment, so collision. Same for U first.\n\nThis seems like a forced death scenario. Maybe the only choice is to choose one and accept death next turn.\n\nGiven that, perhaps choose D to (6,4), as it's closer to some food (though not directly helpful).\n\nBut since both are equally bad, and the instruction is to choose an action, I'll choose D.\n\n\\boxed{D}",

        "thinking": "Alright, let's tackle this Snake game scenario step by step. I'm going to analyze the current state and decide the best immediate action for the snake to maximize its score while avoiding risks.\n\n### Understanding the Current State\n\n**Current Turn**: 32  \n**Walls**:\n- Border walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 (so the grid is 8x8 from (0,0) to (7,7))\n- Internal obstacles: (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3)\n\n**Snake Positions**: \nHead at (6,4), then [(6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2)]  \nSo the tail is at (4,2).\n\n**Snake Head Direction**: Currently moving Down (D). This means the last move was Down, so the snake cannot move Up next (no instant reverse).\n\n**Food**:\n1. (2,5): value=1, life_span=3\n2. (1,3): value=1, life_span=6\n3. (4,1): value=1, life_span=9\n\n### Possible Moves\n\nFrom the head at (6,4), moving Down (D) would go to (6,3). But let's check possible moves considering current direction is D (so cannot move U):\n\nPossible moves from (6,4):\n- U (Up): (6,5) - but this is the body segment right after the head, so collision. Can't go here.\n- D (Down): (6,3) - need to check if this is valid.\n- L (Left): (5,4)\n- R (Right): (7,4) - but x=7 is a wall, so can't go here.\n\nSo possible moves: D or L.\n\n#### Checking Move D (Down to (6,3)):\n\n- (6,3): \n  - Is it a wall? Internal obstacles include (6,3), so yes, it's a wall. Can't move here.\n  \nSo D is invalid.\n\n#### Checking Move L (Left to (5,4)):\n\n- (5,4):\n  - Is it a wall? Internal obstacles include (5,6), (1,4), (4,4), (2,4), (6,3). (5,4) is not listed, so not a wall.\n  - Is it body? Snake body segments: (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2). (5,4) is part of the body.\n  \nNow, can we move into a body segment? Normally, body collision is deadly, but there's an exception: if it's the tail, and the tail will move away. \n\nCurrent tail is at (4,2). (5,4) is not the tail, so moving here would collide with the body. Deadly, can't do this.\n\nWait, but the snake's body is: head at (6,4), then (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), etc. So (5,4) is the 4th segment (counting head as 1st). The tail is (4,2), so (5,4) is not the tail. So moving left to (5,4) would collide with the body. Not allowed.\n\nHmm, seems both D and L are invalid. \n\nWait, is there another move? Current direction is D, so cannot move U (reverse). We've checked D and L, R is wall. So only possible is L but that's body collision.\n\nThis seems like a dead end. Maybe I missed something.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the snake positions:\n\nSnake: [(6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2)]\n\nSo the body segments are (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2).\n\nPossible moves from (6,4):\n\n- U: (6,5) - body, collision.\n- D: (6,3) - wall (internal obstacle).\n- L: (5,4) - body, but is it tail? Tail is (4,2), so no, it's not tail. Collision.\n- R: (7,4) - wall (x=7).\n\nSo all moves lead to collision or wall. This seems like the snake is trapped with no valid moves, which would mean game over.\n\nBut maybe I'm missing something about the tail. The tail is at (4,2), and the segment before tail is (5,2). \n\nIs there any food under the snake's body that we can try to eat by moving away?\n\nLooking at food:\n- (2,5), (1,3), (4,1)\n\nNone of these are under the snake's body. The snake's body covers:\n(6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2)\n\nFood positions:\n(2,5) - not under snake\n(1,3) - not under snake\n(4,1) - not under snake\n\nSo no food under body to try to free up space.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter checking all possible moves:\n- Up: body collision\n- Down: wall\n- Left: body collision (not tail)\n- Right: wall\n\nThere are no valid moves that avoid collision or walls. Therefore, the snake has no possible moves to continue without dying, leading to game over.\n\nHowever, since the task is to provide an immediate action, and all actions lead to death, any move would result in the same outcome. But typically in such cases, the snake would just continue in its current direction until collision.\n\nGiven that, the only possible move is Down, even though it's a wall, because the other options are also invalid.\n\nBut since the instruction is to provide an action, and all actions are invalid, perhaps the correct answer is that no move is possible, but since we must provide one, we can choose any, but it will lead to death.\n\nGiven that, I'll choose Down as it's the current direction.\n\n\\boxed{D}",
