The snake is at position [(3,3)], which means it's just the head since there's only one segment. The head direction is left, so it's facing west.\n> \n> The walls are defined: border cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the grid is from (0,0) to (7,7). Also, there's an internal obstacle at (1,6).\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (4,5) with life span 10 and value +1 (positive food)\n> \n> - (3,5) with life span 10 and value +1\n> \n> - (6,6) with life span 10 and value +1\n> \n> All food has value +1 and life span 10, so they're all positive food. Since life span decreases every turn, including current, and we're at turn 0, they'll disappear after 10 turns if not eaten.\n> \n> The snake is only one segment long, so it's just the head. That means there's no body to collide with yet, except for walls and obstacles.\n> \n> Movement constraints: I can move U, D, L, R, but since current direction is L, I cannot move R (right) on the next turn because that would be instant reverse. So possible moves from (3,3) are U, D, L. R is not allowed because it's opposite to current left direction.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score and prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> First, let's map out the grid. It's 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7). Walls are the borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Obstacle at (1,6).\n> \n> Food at (4,5), (3,5), (6,6).\n> \n> Snake at (3,3).\n> \n> Since the snake is only one segment, eating food will increase its length. After eating, the snake grows, so I need to be careful about collisions later.\n> \n> But for now, no body segments, so the only dangers are walls and the obstacle.\n> \n> Also, the tail reward danger isn't relevant yet since there's no tail.\n> \n> Let me list possible moves from (3,3):\n> \n> - Up (U): to (3,4)\n> \n> - Down (D): to (3,2)\n> \n> - Left (L): to (2,3)\n> \n> - Right (R): but not allowed because it's opposite to current left direction. Current direction is L, so moving R would be instant reverse, which is not permitted. So only U, D, L are possible.\n> \n> Now, I need to consider the food. (3,5) is directly above at (3,5), which is two cells up from (3,3). (4,5) is one right and two up, (6,6) is three right and three up.\n> \n> Since I need to think multiple turns ahead, I should evaluate paths to each food and see which one is safer or more beneficial.\n> \n> Also, since all food is positive, eating any will increase length by one.\n> \n> But with multiple food, I can plan to eat more than one.\n> \n> First, let's see what happens if I move towards (3,5).\n> \n> (3,5) is at (3,5), snake at (3,3). So I can go up twice to reach it.\n> \n> Turn 0: from (3,3), move U to (3,4)\n> \n> Then turn 1: from (3,4), move U to (3,5) and eat the food. Now snake length becomes 2, with positions [(3,5), (3,4)] or something. When you eat, the head moves to the food cell, and a new segment is added, so after eating at (3,5), the snake would be head at (3,5), and tail at (3,4). But since it was moving up, the body is (3,4), and head now at (3,5).\n> \n> Initial: head at (3,3), length 1.\n> \n> After move U to (3,4): head at (3,4), no food there, so tail stays? Since no food eaten, the tail doesn't grow. Since only one segment, after moving to (3,4), snake is at [(3,4)].\n> \n> Then move U to (3,5): now at (3,5), which has food, so eat it, snake grows to length 2: head at (3,5), tail at (3,4).\n> \n> Direction: after first move U, head direction is U, so from (3,4) to (3,5) is U again.\n> \n> Now, at turn 1, head at (3,5), direction U.\n> \n> Food at (3,5) is eaten, so it disappears.\n> \n> Other food: (4,5) and (6,6) still there.\n> \n> Now, from (3,5), possible moves: U, D, L, R. But current direction is U, so cannot move D (down) instantly.\n> \n> Also, walls: y=7 is wall, so if move U to (3,6), that's fine, y=6 is not border yet? y=0 and y=7 are borders, so y=6 is safe, y=7 is wall.\n> \n> Grid: y=0 and y=7 are walls, so cells from y=1 to y=6 are free, but y=7 is wall, so cannot move to y=7.\n> \n> Similarly x=0 and x=7 walls.\n> \n> (3,6) is within bounds, y=6 <7.\n> \n> But if move U to (3,6), that's possible.\n> \n> Or move L to (2,5), R to (4,5), or D to (3,4), but D is opposite to current U, so not allowed.\n> \n> So from (3,5), direction U, can move U, L, R. Not D.\n> \n> (4,5) has food, which is adjacent right.\n> \n> So I could move R to (4,5) and eat it immediately on turn 2? Let's sequence.\n> \n> After eating at (3,5) on turn 1, at turn 2, head at (3,5), direction U.\n> \n> Move R to (4,5): (4,5) has food, so eat it, snake grows to length 3: head at (4,5), body: (3,5) and (3,4)? Positions: before move, snake is [(3,5), (3,4)] head at (3,5).\n> \n> Move R to (4,5): head moves to (4,5), which has food, so eat, add new segment. So snake becomes: head (4,5), then previous head (3,5) becomes body, and tail (3,4). So positions: [(4,5), (3,5), (3,4)].\n> \n> Length 3.\n> \n> Then I have food at (6,6).\n> \n> But I need to think further.\n> \n> If I don't go for (3,5) first, maybe go for other food.\n> \n> Since snake is short, all paths are open.\n> \n> But let's consider the obstacle at (1,6). It might block some areas.\n> \n> Also, I should avoid dead ends.\n> \n> Another thing: life span of food is 10 turns, so I have time, but since I'm at turn 0, and life span 10, they disappear after turn 10, meaning on turn 11 they are gone? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 0, life span 10, after turn 0, it becomes 9, and so on, until life span 0, it disappears before the next turn or something. But it says \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So at turn t, food has life span L, it will disappear after L more turns, meaning it will be there for turns t to t+L-1, and disappear at turn t+L.\n> \n> For example, at turn 0, life span 10, it exists from turn 0 to turn 9, disappears at turn 10.\n> \n> Similarly for all food here.\n> \n> Since all have life span 10, I have 10 turns to eat them, but I can eat them sooner.\n> \n> But with multiple, I need to plan a path.\n> \n> Now, let's list all cells: grid 8x8, but walls at borders, so playable area is x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? No.\n> \n> x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x from 1 to 6? Let's see: coordinates from (0,0) to (7,7), but (0,y) and (7,y) for all y are walls, similarly (x,0) and (x,7) for all x are walls.\n> \n> Also, internal obstacle at (1,6).\n> \n> So free cells: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except (1,6) is obstacle.\n> \n> x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, but (1,6) is blocked.\n> \n> y=6 is not wall, but (1,6) is obstacle, so cells like (1,5), (2,6) etc. are free.\n> \n> x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, minus (1,6).\n> \n> Now food at (4,5), (3,5), (6,6).\n> \n> (3,5) and (4,5) are both at y=5, x=3 and x=4.\n> \n> (6,6) at x=6,y=6.\n> \n> Snake at (3,3).\n> \n> Possible moves from (3,3) direction L: can go U to (3,4), D to (3,2), L to (2,3).\n> \n> If I go L to (2,3), then I'm moving away from the food, which might not be efficient.\n> \n> (2,3) is left, then from there I can go to other places.\n> \n> But let's think about getting to (3,5) quickly.\n> \n> From (3,3) to (3,5): I can go U twice, as I thought.\n> \n> To (4,5): I can go U to (3,4), then R to (4,4), then U to (4,5)? From (3,4), to (4,5) is not adjacent, (4,5) is right and up from (3,4), but moves are only orthogonal, so from (3,4) I can go U to (3,5), R to (4,4), D to (3,3) but not allowed or occupied, L to (2,4).\n> \n> To reach (4,5) from (3,3), one way: U to (3,4), then R to (4,4), then U to (4,5). That's three moves.\n> \n> But (4,5) is at (4,5), from (3,3) to (4,5) is one right and two up, so minimum two moves if I could go diagonal, but orthogonal only, so min two moves only if I go right then up or up then right, but from (3,3), I can go U to (3,4), then from (3,4) to (4,5) is not adjacent; (4,5) is one right from (3,5) or one up from (4,4).\n> \n> From (3,3) to (4,5): paths:\n> \n> - U to (3,4), then R to (4,4), then U to (4,5)  // three moves\n> \n> - Or R first, but I cannot go R from (3,3) because current direction L, opposite not allowed.\n> \n> So only U, D, L possible at start.\n> \n> So after U to (3,4), direction now U, then from (3,4) I can go U to (3,5), R to (4,4), L to (2,4), D not allowed.\n> \n> If I go U to (3,4), then U to (3,5), I eat the food at (3,5) in two moves.\n> \n> Then from there, I can go to (4,5) easily.\n> \n> (4,5) is adjacent right from (3,5), so after eating at (3,5) on turn 1, on turn 2 I can move R to (4,5) and eat it.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,6) is farther.\n> \n> If I go directly to (4,5) first, it would take longer.\n> \n> From (3,3), move U to (3,4) (turn 0), then from (3,4) move R to (4,4) (turn 1), then move U to (4,5) (turn 2) and eat.\n> \n> But at (3,4) I could move U to (3,5) instead.\n> \n> So eating (3,5) is faster, in two turns, while eating (4,5) takes at least three turns from start.\n> \n> (6,6) is at (6,6), from (3,3) is three right and three up, so min three moves if no obstacles.\n> \n> But I can't go right directly.\n> \n> Another option: from (3,3) move D to (3,2), but that might lead to bottom, away from food.\n> \n> Or move L to (2,3), then to (2,4), etc., also away.\n> \n> So probably best to go up towards the food.\n> \n> But I need to think long-term.\n> \n> After eating both (3,5) and (4,5), I have a snake of length 3, and then I can go to (6,6).\n> \n> (6,6) is at corner, x=6,y=6, which is near the wall.\n> \n> x=6 is not wall, x=7 is wall, so (6,6) is safe.\n> \n> But if I go there, I need to be careful not to hit walls.\n> \n> Also, with a longer snake, I need to avoid colliding with body.\n> \n> But for now, snake is short.\n> \n> Let's simulate a sequence.\n> \n> First, at turn 0, from (3,3), I should move U to (3,4) to get closer to (3,5).\n> \n> Then turn 1, from (3,4), I can move U to (3,5) and eat the food.

(6,5) is directly to the right of head if I go right twice: from (4,5) to (5,5) to (6,5). Similarly, (6,6) is up and right.\n> \n> But I have to think about the path and possible collisions.\n> \n> Also, the snake has a body at (3,5), which is left of head, and tail at (3,4).\n> \n> If I move, the body will follow. For example, if I move right to (5,5), then the new positions: head at (5,5), body at (4,5), tail at (3,5)? Let's see how the snake moves.\n> \n> When snake moves, head goes to new position, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead. So after moving right to (5,5):\n> \n> - New head: (5,5)\n> \n> - Body: previous head position (4,5) becomes the new first body segment\n> \n> - Then the previous first body (3,5) moves to where? The segment that was at (3,5) moves to the position of the previous head, which is (4,5)? No.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: the tail moves forward, so the segment at tail position moves away.\n> \n> Initial positions: [head (4,5), body1 (3,5), body2/tail (3,4)]\n> \n> After moving head to new position, say (5,5):\n> \n> - New head: (5,5)\n> \n> - The body segments follow: the first body segment moves to where head was, (4,5)\n> \n> - The tail moves to where the first body was, (3,5)\n> \n> But the tail was at (3,4), so it moves to (3,5)? That doesn't make sense.\n> \n> Positions list: index 0: head, index 1: body, index 2: tail.\n> \n> When head moves to a new cell, the tail is removed unless food is eaten, but if no food eaten, snake doesn't grow, so tail is removed.\n> \n> Rule: when you eat food, length increases, so tail is not removed; if no food, tail is removed.\n> \n> In this case, if I don't eat food, after moving, the snake will have head at new position, and the body segments shift: the last segment (tail) is removed.\n> \n> So from [(4,5), (3,5), (3,4)]:\n> \n> Move to (5,5): new positions: head (5,5), then the first body segment is now at (4,5), and the second body segment (which was tail) is at (3,5). But since no food eaten, length stays 3, so the tail (3,4) is removed, and the new tail is the segment that was at (3,5), now at (3,5)? Let's clarify.\n> \n> Typically, in snake games, when moving without eating:\n> \n> - Head moves to new cell.\n> \n> - Each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment in front.\n> \n> - The tail cell is vacated.\n> \n> So positions: let S be the list: S[0] = head, S[1] = first body, S[2] = tail.\n> \n> After move to new head position H_new:\n> \n> - New S[0] = H_new\n> \n> - New S[1] = old S[0] (previous head position)\n> \n> - New S[2] = old S[1] (previous first body position)\n> \n> - The old S[2] is no longer part of snake, so cell is free.\n> \n> In this case, old: S[0] = (4,5), S[1] = (3,5), S[2] = (3,4)\n> \n> After moving head to (5,5):\n> \n> New S[0] = (5,5)\n> \n> New S[1] = old S[0] = (4,5)\n> \n> New S[2] = old S[1] = (3,5)\n> \n> And (3,4) is now free.\n> \n> Similarly, if I move up to (4,6):\n> \n> New head (4,6), new body at (4,5), new tail at (3,5), and (3,4) free.\n> \n> Down to (4,4): head (4,4), body (4,5), tail (3,5), (3,4) free.\n> \n> Now, food at (6,5) and (6,6). Both have positive value, so I want to eat them to grow.\n> \n> But I need to plan a sequence of moves.\n> \n> Also, life span: food at (6,6) has life span 7, meaning it disappears after 7 turns including current, so from turn 3, it will disappear after turn 3+7-1? Life span decreases every turn, including current.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So for food at (6,6), life span 7 at turn 3. After turn 3, life span becomes 6, and so on, until it reaches 0, then disappears.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,5) life span 8 at turn 3.\n> \n> Since current turn is 3, (6,6) will be gone after turn 9 (since turn 3: life=7, turn 4:6, ..., turn 9:0, gone after turn 9? Or at the end of turn when life=0?\n> \n> Typically, it disappears when life span reaches 0, so after the turn where countdown reaches 0.\n> \n> But for planning, I need to reach it before life span ends.\n> \n> (6,6) life=7 at turn 3, so it will disappear after turn 9 (since 3+7-1=9? Let's calculate: start turn t, life=N, after N turns, it disappears, meaning after (t + N - 1) it is gone? I think it's better to think in terms of when it expires.\n> \n> Rule: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so at turn t, countdown = N, then at turn t+1, countdown = N-1, ..., at turn t + N - 1, countdown=1, then at turn t + N, countdown=0 and it disappears, so you must eat it on or before turn t + N - 1.\n> \n> For (6,6) at turn 3, life=7, so must be eaten by turn 3 + 7 - 1 = 9? Turn 3: countdown=7, turn 4:6, ..., turn 9: countdown=1, turn 10: countdown=0, gone. So must eat by turn 9.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,5) life=8 at turn 3, must eat by turn 3+8-1=10.\n> \n> But since we start from turn 3, and I need to plan actions for turns starting from t=3.\n> \n> Now, head at (4,5), I can move U, D, or R.\n> \n> If I move R to (5,5), then positions: head (5,5), body (4,5), tail (3,5)\n> \n> Food at (6,5) is at (6,5), which is adjacent to (5,5) if I go right again.\n> \n> But from (5,5), I can go to (6,5) to eat the food, but need to check if it's safe.\n> \n> First, what about the other food at (6,6)?\n> \n> Also, there's a special rule: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because head and newly grown tail collide.\n> \n> In this case, at turn 3, tail is at (3,4), not adjacent to head. Head at (4,5), tail at (3,4), which is adjacent? Adjacent means sharing a side, so (4,5) and (3,4) are diagonal? No, adjacent should be up, down, left, right, not diagonal.\n> \n> So (4,5) and (3,4) are not adjacent; they are diagonal. Adjacent cells share a common edge, so for (4,5), adjacent are (4,6) up, (4,4) down, (3,5) left, (5,5) right.\n> \n> Tail is at (3,4), which is not adjacent to (4,5); it's one step left and one down.\n> \n> So no issue now.\n> \n> Back to moving.\n> \n> Option 1: Move R to (5,5) at turn 3.\n> \n> Then turn 4: from (5,5), I can move to (6,5) to eat the food there, or move elsewhere.\n> \n> If I move to (6,5) on turn 4, I eat the food at (6,5), which has value +1, so snake grows.\n> \n> When you eat food, the tail doesn't move; a new segment is added where the tail was, so length increases.\n> \n> After eating, positions: when head moves to food cell, food is eaten, and the snake grows by one segment, so the tail doesn't move; instead, a new segment is added at the tail position, but since tail moves only if no food, it's a bit different.\n> \n> Standard: when head moves to a cell with food, the food is consumed, and the snake grows. So the head moves to the food cell, and the body segments follow, but the tail stays where it is, so the new segment is added, meaning the tail position doesn't change; the segment that was tail remains, and a new segment is added behind? No.\n> \n> In terms of positions: after moving head to food cell, the positions are updated: new head at food cell, body segments shift, but since food eaten, the tail is not removed; instead, the snake gains a segment, so the last position (tail) stays, and a new segment is added at the end.\n> \n> But the new segment is added at the previous tail position, but since the tail would have moved if no food, it's like the tail doesn't advance.\n> \n> Example: current positions before move: [H, B1, T]\n> \n> After moving to food cell: new head at food, new B1 at old H, new B2 at old B1, and since food eaten, a new segment is added at old T position? But old T position might be occupied or something.\n> \n> Typically, the growth happens at the next move; after eating, the tail doesn't retreat for that move.\n> \n> So for simplicity: when snake eats food, after the move, the length increases, so the tail position remains, and a new body segment is effectively added.\n> \n> In position list: after moving head to new position (with food), the body segments move as usual, but the tail segment is not removed; instead, it stays, and the list has one more segment.\n> \n> Initial: [ (4,5), (3,5), (3,4) ]\n> \n> Move head to (5,5) – no food there, so new positions: [ (5,5), (4,5), (3,5) ] and (3,4) free.\n> \n> But if (5,5) had food, and I move there, eat food, then new positions: head at (5,5), then body at (4,5), and tail at (3,5), but since ate food, the tail stays and a new segment is added, so positions become [ (5,5), (4,5), (3,5) ] and the tail is at (3,5), but it was already there, and length increases, so the segment at (3,5) remains, and since it was the tail, it becomes the second body, and a new tail is added, but the new tail is added at the position where the tail was before growth? I think I'm confusing myself.\n> \n> Standard implementation: when snake eats food, during the move, the head moves to the food cell, the body follows, but the tail does not move; so the snake grows by one cell at the tail end.\n> \n> So for positions: after eating, the position list has the new head position, then all previous positions, including the tail.\n> \n> Example: positions [A, B, C] where C is tail.\n> \n> Move head to D, which has food. Then new positions: [D, A, B, C] – head D, then A, B, C, so tail is now C, and the snake has grown.\n> \n> Similarly, if no food, move to D no food, new positions [D, A, B] , tail B, C removed.\n> \n> In this case, for turn 3, if I move to (5,5), no food there, so new snake: [(5,5), (4,5), (3,5)] and (3,4) free.\n> \n> Then turn 4, from (5,5), I can move to (6,5) which has food. So move to (6,5), eat food, so new positions: head (6,5), then previous head (5,5), then body (4,5), then tail (3,5), so [(6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5)] and length 4.\n> \n> Similarly, if I go to (6,5) directly, but from (4,5) to (6,5) is two moves.\n> \n> Back to turn 3 options.\n> \n> Also, the other food at (6,6).\n> \n> Now, grid boundaries: x=0 to 7, y=0 to 7, so (6,5) and (6,6) are within bounds, not walls.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (1,6), which is not near, so ignore for now.\n> \n> Now, possible moves from (4,5):\n> \n> - R to (5,5): as above.\n> \n> - U to (4,6)\n> \n> - D to (4,4)\n> \n> I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> First, let's consider going for the closer food at (6,5).\n> \n> From (4,5), move R to (5,5) on turn 3.\n> \n> Then on turn 4, from (5,5), I can move R to (6,5) to eat the food.\n> \n> After eating, snake is at [(6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5)] with length 4.\n> \n> Now, head at (6,5), direction R (since moved right).\n> \n> From here, I can move U, D, L, or R?

Let me check: \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value: - (6, 6, 6, 1) - (6, 5, 7, 1) - (2, 2, 10, 1)\" So all have value 1, so all positive food. No negative food mentioned.\n> - So: Food at (6,6) with life 6 turns, (6,5) with life 7 turns, and (2,2) with life 10 turns. All +1 value.\n> \n> Grid size: Since walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6)? x from 1 to 6? Let's see: x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x=1 to x=6 are playable? Similarly for y.\n> \n> x=0 and x=7 are walls, so valid x: 1 to 6? But (6,5) is given, and x=6 should be playable if walls are at x=0 and x=7. Typically, walls are at the borders, so cells from (1,1) to (6,6) might be playable, but let's confirm.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (1,6), which is within the grid.\n> \n> Also, snake is at (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), so y=5, x from 3 to 5.\n> \n> Now, head direction is R, so moving right.\n> \n> I need to plan actions for turns starting from t=4, and think 5+ turns ahead. So from turn 4 to at least turn 9 or so.\n> \n> First, let's sketch the grid:\n> \n> - Rows y=0 to y=7, but y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=1 to y=6 are playable? Walls are at y=0 and y=7, so cells with y=1 to y=6 should be playable, similarly x=1 to x=6.\n> \n> But there's an internal obstacle at (1,6), which is playable cell but blocked.\n> \n> Also, food at (6,6), (6,5), (2,2).\n> \n> (6,5) is directly to the right of the head, since head is at (5,5), moving right, so (6,5) is adjacent right.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,6) is up-right from head? Head at (5,5), (6,6) is one step right and one step up.\n> \n> (2,2) is far away.\n> \n> Life spans: food at (6,6) life 6, meaning it disappears after 6 turns? Countdown decreases every turn, including current.\n> \n> Current turn is t=4.\n> \n> Life span: it says \"life_span\" and \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> For food at (6,6): life_span=6 at turn 4. So after turn 4, it has 5 turns left? Let's interpret.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So at the time it is spawned, life_span=N, then each turn, it decreases by 1, and when it reaches 0, it disappears? But it says \"disappears after N turns\", meaning it lasts for N turns including the turn it was spawned or after?\n> \n> It says: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so at turn t when it appears, life_span=N, then at turn t, countdown is N, and it decreases each turn, so after N turns, at turn t+N, it disappears? I think I need to clarify.\n> \n> Suppose food spawns at turn S with life_span L. Then at turn S, countdown = L. After each turn, countdown decreases by 1. When countdown reaches 0, the food disappears at the end of that turn or beginning? But for decision, we care about when it can be eaten.\n> \n> Since it can be eaten only if the head moves onto it when it exists.\n> \n> For (6,6): at turn 4, life_span=6, so countdown=6. After turn 4, countdown becomes 5; after turn 5, 4; ... after turn 9, countdown=0, so it disappears after turn 9 or at start of turn 10? But since countdown decreases every turn including current, at turn t, if countdown >0, food is present.\n> \n> At turn 4, countdown=6, so it will be present until turn 9 (since after turn 9, countdown=0, gone). Let's calculate:\n> \n> - Turn 4: countdown=6\n> \n> - After turn 4 (start of turn 5), countdown=5\n> \n> - Start of turn 5: countdown=5\n> \n> - After turn 5, countdown=4\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - Start of turn 9: countdown=1\n> \n> - After turn 9, countdown=0, so food disappears, not available on turn 10.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,5) life_span=7 at turn 4, so countdown=7 at turn 4, disappears after turn 10 (start of turn 11, countdown=0).\n> \n> (2,2) life_span=10, countdown=10, disappears after turn 13.\n> \n> Now, snake positions: head at (5,5), body at (4,5), tail at (3,5). So the snake occupies (3,5), (4,5), (5,5). Length 3.\n> \n> Head direction R, so moving right.\n> \n> Possible actions at turn 4: since head direction is R, I can move U (up), D (down), or R (right), but not L (left) because that would be instant reverse, which is not allowed. \"No instant reverse\": cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn. Current direction is R, so opposite is L, so cannot move L. So possible moves: U, D, R.\n> \n> Now, let's see the immediate options:\n> \n> - Move R to (6,5): but (6,5) has food! Value +1, so if I move there, I eat it, snake length increases to 4.\n> \n> But is it safe? Let's see.\n> \n> First, (6,5) is within bounds? x=6, y=5. Walls at x=0,x=7,y=0,y=7. x=6 should be playable since x=7 is wall, so x=1 to x=6 are playable? x=0 and x=7 walls, so cells x=1 to x=6, y=1 to y=6 should be playable, except obstacles.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (1,6), not affecting here.\n> \n> So (6,5) is a valid cell.\n> \n> If I move to (6,5), I eat the food there, so snake grows: new head at (6,5), body was (5,5) now becomes body, (4,5) body, and tail (3,5) will move? When you eat, the tail doesn't move, so positions become: head at (6,5), then previous head (5,5) now body, then (4,5) body, and (3,5) tail. But since I ate, the tail stays, so new segment added? Standard snake: when you eat, you grow, so the tail doesn't move that turn.\n> \n> Rule: \"Length of snake +1\" when eating positive food. So after eating, the snake grows by one segment.\n> \n> So if I move to (6,5) at turn 4, I eat the food, so positions: head at (6,5), then (5,5) (which was head, now body), (4,5) (body), and (3,5) (tail), and since I ate, a new segment is added, but where? Typically, the new segment is added at the tail, but it doesn't move, so the tail stays in place for that turn.\n> \n> After moving to (6,5) and eating, the snake becomes: head (6,5), body (5,5), body (4,5), tail (3,5). But since length increased, at the end of the turn, the tail doesn't move, so the new position is head at (6,5), body at (5,5), body at (4,5), and tail at (3,5), with length 4 now. Next turn, when I move, the tail will move.\n> \n> Similarly, if I don't eat, tail moves.\n> \n> But for collision, when I move to a cell, I need to check if it's safe.\n> \n> Moving to (6,5): is it occupied? Snake occupies (3,5), (4,5), (5,5). (6,5) is not occupied, and no wall, so it's free. Food is there, so I eat it.\n> \n> But there's a danger: \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and newly grown tail collide.\n> \n> In this case, tail is at (3,5), head at (5,5), not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing an edge, so (3,5) and (5,5) are not adjacent; (4,5) is between them. So distance is 2, not adjacent. So no issue.\n> \n> Head moving to (6,5), which is adjacent to current head (5,5), but tail is at (3,5), far. So safe to eat.\n> \n> But let's confirm the grid.\n> \n> y-coordinates: from 0 to 7, walls at y=0 and y=7, so y=1 to y=6 playable.\n> \n> Similarly x=1 to x=6.\n> \n> (6,5) is valid.\n> \n> Now, other moves: I can move U to (5,6) or D to (5,4).\n> \n> (5,6): is it free? Snake at y=5, x=3,4,5, so (5,6) is above head. Is there food? Food at (6,6) and (6,5), not at (5,6). So empty cell, I assume.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,4) below, no food mentioned, so empty.\n> \n> Also, walls: y=6 is playable? y=7 is wall, so y=6 should be playable. Similarly y=4.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (1,6), not here.\n> \n> So possible moves from (5,5) at turn 4: U to (5,6), D to (5,4), R to (6,5).\n> \n> R to (6,5) has food.\n> \n> But I need to think long-term.\n> \n> There's also food at (6,6) and (2,2).\n> \n> (2,2) is far, life span 10, so plenty of time.\n> \n> But (6,5) and (6,6) are close, with shorter life.\n> \n> (6,5) life 7, so disappears after turn 10, (6,6) after turn 9.\n> \n> Since I'm at (5,5), moving R to (6,5) is immediate food.\n> \n> But let's think ahead.\n> \n> If I eat at (6,5), snake grows to length 4, head at (6,5), direction was R, but after moving, direction changes to the move I make.\n> \n> After moving to (6,5), the new head direction is R, I think, but for next move, I can choose new direction.\n> \n> Current head direction is given as R, but after moving, the direction is based on the move.\n> \n> For no instant reverse, it's based on the current move direction.\n> \n> At turn 4, I move to (6,5) with action R.\n> \n> Then at turn 5, head at (6,5), and I just moved R, so I can move U, D, R, but not L (left, opposite of R).\n> \n> Now, from (6,5), possible moves: U to (6,6), D to (6,4), R to (7,5) but x=7 is wall, so cannot move R. x=7 is wall, so (7,5) is invalid, collision.\n> \n> So from (6,5), I can only move U or D, not R, and not L because of no reverse, but L would be to (5,5), which is now body? Let's see.\n> \n> After moving to (6,5) at turn 4, positions: head (6,5), body (5,5), body (4,5), tail (3,5).\n> \n> At turn 5, if I move L to (5,5), (5,5) is occupied by body, so collision. Also, moving L is opposite to last direction R, so not allowed anyway.\n> \n> Last move was R, so cannot move L. So only U or D possible.\n> \n> U to (6,6): (6,6) has food! Positive food, value +1.\n> \n> If I move U to (6,6), I eat it, snake grows to length 5.\n> \n> Is it safe? (6,6) is adjacent to head (6,5), and tail is at (3,5), not adjacent, so no tail reward danger.\n> \n> Then positions: head at (6,6), body at (6,5), body at (5,5), body at (4,5), tail at (3,5). Length 5.\n> \n> Now, from there, I might be stuck at top-right corner.\n> \n> (6,6) is at the corner, since x=6, y=6 are borders, x=7 wall, y=7 wall.\n> \n> From (6,6), possible moves: since I just moved U, last direction U, so I can move L, R, D, but not U? No, no instant reverse, so cannot move opposite to last move.\n> \n> Last move was U (up), so opposite is D (down). So cannot move D.\n> \n> Possible: L to (5,6), R to (7,6) but x=7 wall, invalid, U to (6,7) but y=7 wall, invalid. So only possible move is L to (5,6).\n> \n> (5,6) is free? Currently, snake at (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6) after eating? After moving to (6,6) at turn 5, positions: head (6,6), body (6,5), body (5,5), body (4,5), tail (3,5). (5,6) is not occupied, and no wall, so I can move to (5,6).\n> \n> Then at turn 6, head to (5,6), last move L, so now can move U, D, L, but not R (opposite).\n> \n> From (5,6), possible moves: U to (5,7) y=7 wall, invalid; D to (5,5), but (5,5) is body; L to (4,6); R to (6,6) but last move was L, so cannot move R immediately? Last move from (6,6) to (5,6) is L, so direction L, opposite is R, so cannot move R.\n> \n> But (6,6) is occupied by body now, so moving R to (6,6) would collide with body.\n> \n> Similarly, D to (5,5) is body.\n> \n> U to (5,7) wall.\n> \n> So only possible move is L to (4,6).\n> \n> (4,6) should be free, assuming no food or obstacle.\n> \n> Then continue, but I'm moving away, and might get trapped or something.\n> \n> But let's not get ahead; this is one path.\n> \n> Back to turn 4.\n> \n> If I move R to (6,5) at turn 4, I get +1, head at (6,5).\n> \n> Then at turn 5, I can move U to (6,6) to get another +1 immediately, as above.\n> \n> Or move D to (6,4).\n> \n> If I move D to (6,4) at turn 5, no food there, I assume, so just move, tail moves, so positions: head to (6,4), body (6,5), body (5,5), tail (4,5), since tail moves, and (3,5) is abandoned. Length still 4? After eating at turn 4, length 4, so at turn 5, if I don't eat, tail moves, so positions: head to (6,4), body (6,5), body (5,5), body (4,5), and tail was (4,5)?

So at turn 5, life span is 5, so it will last until turn 5 + 5 - 1? Let's clarify life span.\n> \n> Life span: it disappears after N turns, and countdown decreases every turn including current. So for a food with life span N at turn t, it will be present for N turns, from turn t to turn t + N - 1. At turn t + N, it disappears.\n> \n> For the food at (6,6): life span 5 at turn 5. So it appears at turn 5, and will be there until turn 9 (since 5 + 5 - 1 = 9). Turn 5: life span 5, after turn 5, life span becomes 4, and so on, until turn 10 when it would be gone, but since it decreases at each turn, on turn 10, if life span was 1 at turn 9, after turn 9 it becomes 0 and disappears. Standard: at turn t, with life span L, after the turn, L decreases by 1. If L=1 at turn t, it is eaten or disappears after that turn.\n> \n> But for planning, we care about when it exists. So food at (6,6) with L=5 at t=5: exists from t=5 to t=9 inclusive. After turn 9, it disappears.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (2,2) with value 1, life span 9 at t=5: exists from t=5 to t=13 (since 5 + 9 - 1 = 13).\n> \n> Both foods have value +1, so positive food.\n> \n> Now, snake head is at (6,5), moving right. But x=7 is a wall, so moving right to (7,5) is impossible; it's a wall collision. So I cannot move right. But the head direction is R, so I need to change direction.\n> \n> Available moves: since head direction is R, I can move U, D, or L? But no instant reverse, so I cannot move left because left is opposite of right. Opposite directions: U and D are opposites, L and R are opposites.\n> \n> Current direction R, so I can move U, D, or R? But R to (7,5) is wall, so invalid. So possible moves: U or D, but not L because L is opposite of R.\n> \n> Movement constraints: cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn. So from R, I can move U, D, or R, but R is blocked by wall.\n> \n> So at turn t=5, I must choose between U or D.\n> \n> If I move U, to (6,6)? (6,6) is a food position, but let's see.\n> \n> First, list possible actions for turn 5.\n> \n> Head at (6,5), direction R.\n> \n> Possible moves:\n> \n> - U: to (6,6)\n> \n> - D: to (6,4)\n> \n> - R: to (7,5) but x=7 wall, invalid\n> \n> - L: to (5,5) but (5,5) is the body segment, but it's the tail? Snake positions: [(6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5)] so head (6,5), then (5,5) is the first body segment, which is the neck, and (3,5) is the tail.\n> \n> When I move, if I move to a cell not occupied by body or wall, it's fine. But if I move to (5,5), which is occupied by the body, except that (5,5) is the segment that will become the new tail after move, so it might be okay to move there if it's the tail cell and will move away.\n> \n> Collision rules: body collision if head touches any body segment, but you can move into the cell occupied by the tail segment because the tail moves forward, so after move, the tail is no longer there.\n> \n> So for movement to (5,5): (5,5) is currently occupied by the second segment. After moving left to (5,5), the head moves to (5,5), but (5,5) was the position of the first body segment. After the move, the snake positions will be: head at (5,5), then the old head (6,5) becomes new body? No.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when snake moves, head goes to new position, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead. So tail segment is removed if no food eaten, or if food eaten, tail doesn't move, so snake grows.\n> \n> Specifically: if no food eaten, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so the tail position is vacated. If food eaten, head moves to food cell, body segments move as before, but tail stays, so snake grows by one.\n> \n> Now, collision: head cannot move to a cell that will be occupied by a body segment after the move, except for the current tail cell, because the tail moves away.\n> \n> In this case, if I move left to (5,5), which is currently occupied by the first body segment. After moving, the head would be at (5,5), but (5,5) was the position of the first body segment, which will move to where? Let's simulate.\n> \n> Current positions: index 0: head (6,5), 1: (5,5), 2: (4,5), 3: (3,5) tail.\n> \n> If I move left to (5,5): new head position (5,5). Since I moved to (5,5), which is not a food cell (foods are at (6,6) and (2,2), so (5,5) has no food), so no food eaten. Therefore, the body segments: segment 1 moves to where head was, (6,5)? No.\n> \n> After move: head moves to new position (5,5). Then, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> So new positions: head at (5,5)\n> \n> Then body segment that was at index 1 (5,5) moves to where head was, (6,5)? But (6,5) is now the new position for segment 1? Let's think of the positions.\n> \n> Before move: positions: [ (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5) ]\n> \n> After move left to (5,5):\n> \n> - Head moves to (5,5)\n> \n> - Then, the segment that was at (5,5) (index 1) moves to the previous position of head, which is (6,5)? No.\n> \n> The movement: the head moves to the new cell. Then, each subsequent segment moves into the cell where the previous segment was.\n> \n> So: the segment that was at index 1 (position (5,5)) will move to where index 0 (head) was, which is (6,5).\n> \n> Similarly, index 2 (4,5) moves to where index 1 was, (5,5).\n> \n> Index 3 (tail) moves to where index 2 was, (4,5).\n> \n> But when head moves to (5,5), which is the same as where index 1 was, so at that moment, before the body moves, both head and index 1 are at (5,5)? That would be collision.\n> \n> I think I have a confusion.\n> \n> Standard way: when you move the head to a new cell, if that cell is not occupied, then the tail moves forward, so the cell that was tail is vacated.\n> \n> But if the head moves to a cell that is currently occupied by a body segment, it's collision, except if it's the tail.\n> \n> In this case, (5,5) is occupied by the first body segment, which is not the tail. The tail is at (3,5).\n> \n> So moving to (5,5) would cause head to collide with the body segment at (5,5), because after head moves to (5,5), that cell is now head, but the body segment at (5,5) is still there until it moves, but in terms of the grid, during the move, when head moves to (5,5), it is entering a cell occupied by body, so collision.\n> \n> The rules say: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> Here, (5,5) is not the tail segment; it's the first body segment. The tail is at (3,5).\n> \n> Therefore, moving to (5,5) would cause collision with body.\n> \n> Similarly, moving to (6,5) is where head is now, invalid.\n> \n> Moving to (7,5) wall, invalid.\n> \n> So for turn 5, from (6,5) with direction R, possible moves:\n> \n> - U: to (6,6) - which might be food, and not occupied by body? Current body positions: (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5). So (6,6) is not in that list, so empty or food.\n> \n> - D: to (6,4) - similarly, not occupied.\n> \n> - L: to (5,5) - occupied by body segment, not tail, so collision.\n> \n> - R: to (7,5) - wall, collision.\n> \n> So only U and D are possible moves.\n> \n> Now, (6,6) has food, as per food list: (6,6,5,1) meaning (x,y,life_span,value) so (6,6) with value 1.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,4) is empty, I think.\n> \n> Grid: walls at x=0,7 y=0,7, and internal obstacle at (1,6), so (1,6) is blocked.\n> \n> (6,6) is a valid cell, not wall.\n> \n> Now, if I move U to (6,6), I eat the food there, since it's positive food, snake grows by one.\n> \n> If I move D to (6,4), no food, so snake moves without growing.\n> \n> But I need to think ahead multiple turns.\n> \n> Also, the food at (6,6) has life span 5, so it will disappear after turn 9, as I thought earlier.\n> \n> But at turn 5, I can eat it if I move there.\n> \n> Now, there's a special case: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because head and newly grown tail collide.\n> \n> In this case, tail is at (3,5), head at (6,5), not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing an edge, so (6,5) and (3,5) are not adjacent; they are 3 units apart.\n> \n> So no issue with that for now.\n> \n> Now, let's plan actions.\n> \n> I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> First, for turn 5, I can choose U or D.\n> \n> Option 1: Move U to (6,6) at turn 5.\n> \n> Then, I eat the food, snake grows to length 5. New positions: head moves to (6,6), body: (6,5) becomes new segment, then (5,5), (4,5), (3,5). So positions: [(6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5)]\n> \n> Head direction now U, since I moved up.\n> \n> Food at (6,6) is eaten, so removed. Only food left is at (2,2) with life span 9, so exists until turn 13.\n> \n> Now, turn 6: head at (6,6), direction U.\n> \n> Possible moves: U, D, L, R, but no instant reverse. Direction U, so cannot move D (down).\n> \n> Also, walls: x=7 wall, y=7 wall? y=7 is top wall.\n> \n> Grid: y=0 bottom, y=7 top? Since walls y=0 and y=7, so y from 1 to 6? No.\n> \n> Walls: border cells x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the playable area is x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? But internal obstacle (1,6), which is within.\n> \n> x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except (1,6) is wall.\n> \n> So (6,6): if I move U from (6,6), to (6,7), but y=7 is wall, so invalid.\n> \n> Move D: to (6,5), but (6,5) is now occupied by the second body segment? After eating, positions: head (6,6), then (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5)\n> \n> At turn 6, head at (6,6), direction U.\n> \n> Move U to (6,7): y=7 wall, invalid.\n> \n> Move D to (6,5): (6,5) is occupied by the first body segment. Is it safe? (6,5) is the position of the segment that was just behind head, which will become the new body after move.\n> \n> If I move D to (6,5), that cell is currently occupied by the first body segment. After move, head moves to (6,5), but (6,5) is where the body segment is, so collision, unless it's the tail.\n> \n> Here, (6,5) is not the tail; tail is at (3,5). So moving to (6,5) would cause collision with body.\n> \n> Move L to (5,6): (5,6) is within grid? x=5,y=6. Walls: x=0,7 y=0,7, so (5,6) should be valid, and not occupied? Current positions: (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5). So (5,6) not occupied.\n> \n> Move R to (7,6): x=7 wall, invalid.\n> \n> So possible moves from (6,6) direction U: U and R invalid, D invalid because body, so only L to (5,6) is possible? But I can move L to (5,6), or is there down? D is invalid.\n> \n> Moves: U invalid (wall), D to (6,5) but body collision, L to (5,6), R to (7,6) wall invalid.\n> \n> So only L to (5,6) is possible.\n> \n> Then, after moving to (5,6), no food there, so snake moves, tail moves. Positions: head to (5,6), body: (6,6) moves to (6,6)? Let's see: head was (6,6), moves to (5,6). Since no food, tail moves: the segment at (3,5) is removed, so new positions: head (5,6), then the segment that was at (6,5) moves to (6,6)? Positions before move: [ (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5) ]\n> \n> After move to (5,6), no food eaten:\n> \n> - Head to (5,6)\n> \n> - Segment 1 (was at (6,5)) moves to previous head position (6,6)\n> \n> - Segment 2 (was at (5,5)) moves to where segment 1 was, but segment 1 is moving to (6,6), so segment 2 moves to (6,5)? Let's step by step.\n> \n> After head moves to new position (5,6), the body segments shift: the segment that was at index 1 (position (6,5)) moves to where index 0 was, (6,6). Similarly, segment at index 2 (5,5) moves to where index 1 was, (6,5). Segment at index 3 (4,5) moves to where index 2 was, (5,5). Segment at index 4 (tail, (3,5)) is removed since no growth.\n> \n> So new positions: head (5,6), then (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), and tail (4,5)? Segments: index 0: (5,6), index 1: (6,6), index 2: (6,5), index 3: (5,5), index 4: (4,5) — but we started with 5 segments? Original snake had 4 segments: positions list has 4 elements: [(6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5)] so length 4. After eating at (6,6), it grew to length 5: [(6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5)].\n> \n> After moving to (5,6) no food: head to (5,6), then body: segment 1 (was (6,5)) to (6,6), segment 2 (was (5,5)) to (6,5), segment 3 (was (4,5)) to (5,5), segment 4 (was (3,5)) to (4,5), and tail segment (3,5) is gone, so positions: [(5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5)] — (4,5) is the tail now.\n> \n> (4,5) was index 3, now it moves to where index 2 was? Indexing: after head move, the new body segments are: the previous head position becomes new neck, etc.\n> \n> New head: (5,6)\n> \n> New segment 1: position where head was, (6,6)\n> \n> New segment 2: position where segment 1 was, (6,5)\n> \n> New segment 3: position where segment 2 was, (5,5)\n> \n> New segment 4: position where segment 3 was, (4,5)\n> \n> Segment 3 was (4,5)? Previous positions: index 0: (6,6) head, index 1: (6,5), index 2: (5,5), index 3: (4,5), index 4: (3,5)\n> \n> After head moves to (5,6):\n> \n> - New head: (5,6)\n> \n> - New index 1: previous index 0 position, (6,6)\n> \n> - New index 2: previous index 1 position, (6,5)\n> \n> - New index 3: previous index 2 position, (5,5)\n> \n> - New index 4: previous index 3 position, (4,5)\n> \n> - And previous index 4 (3,5) is not part of snake anymore.\n> \n> So new positions: [(5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5)]\n> \n> Tail at (4,5).\n> \n> Now, head at (5,6), direction? I moved L from (6,6), so direction is now L (left).\n> \n> Turn 7: head at (5,6), direction L.\n> \n> Possible moves: U, D, L, R, but no instant reverse, so cannot move R (right, opposite of L).\n> \n> Also, walls: move U to (5,7) y=7 wall, invalid.\n> \n> Move D to (5,5): (5,5) is occupied by a body segment? Current positions: (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5). So (5,5) is index 3, body segment.\n> \n> Moving to (5,5) would collide with body.\n> \n> Move L to (4,6): (4,6) not occupied, should be ok.\n> \n> Move R to (6,6): but (6,6) is occupied by index 1, body segment, collision.\n> \n> So only possible move L to (4,6).\n> \n> Then continue, but this seems like I'm getting stuck in the corner.\n> \n> From (5,6) move L to (4,6), no food, so positions shift.\n> \n> But let's not get too deep yet.\n> \n> Back to turn 5.\n> \n> If at turn 5 I move U to (6,6), I eat food, grow to 5, then at turn 6 I can only move L to (5,6), then turn 7 from (5,6) I can only move L to (4,6) or down, but D to (5,5) is body, U invalid, R invalid, so L to (4,6).\n> \n> Then at (4,6), I can move L, D, or U, etc.\n> \n> But there's another food at (2,2), far away.\n> \n> If I go down at turn 5.\n> \n> Option 2: at turn 5, move D to (6,4).\n> \n> Then, no food eaten, so snake moves: head to (6,4), body: (5,5) moves to (6,5)? Positions before: [ (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5) ]\n> \n> After move D to (6,4): no food, so head (6,4), then segment 1 (was (5,5)) to (6,5), segment 2 (was (4,5)) to (5,5), segment 3 (was (3,5)) to (4,5), tail gone.\n> \n> New positions: [(6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5)] tail at (4,5).\n> \n> Head direction now D (down).\n> \n> Now turn 6: head at (6,4), direction D.\n> \n> Possible moves: U, D, L, R.\n> \n> No instant reverse, so cannot move U (up).\n> \n> Move D to (6,3): (6,3) should be valid, not occupied.\n> \n> Move L to (5,4): valid.\n> \n> Move R to (7,4) wall, invalid.\n> \n> Move U to (6,5): but (6,5) is occupied by body segment, index 1, so collision.\n> \n> So possible moves: D to (6,3) or L to (5,4).\n> \n> Both seem ok.\n> \n> Now, I need to think long-term.

It's turn 6, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think? Let me confirm the coordinates.\n> \n> Walls: Border cells are x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7. So the grid goes from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7, but since walls are at the borders, the snake can only be on cells from (1,1) to (6,6), I believe. But let's see the snake positions: head at (6,4), which is within 1 to 6 in both axes? x=6, y=4. x=6 is okay since walls are at x=0 and x=7, so x from 1 to 6 should be playable? Similarly y from 1 to 6? But y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y from 1 to 6.\n> \n> Also, there's an internal obstacle at (1,6).\n> \n> Snake positions: [(6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5)] so head is at (6,4), then body segments: (6,5), (5,5), (4,5). So the tail is at (4,5).\n> \n> Head direction is Down, which is D. Moving down decreases y, I think? Let's clarify directions:\n> \n> U: (x, y+1) — up, increasing y\n> \n> D: (x, y-1) — down, decreasing y\n> \n> L: (x-1, y) — left, decreasing x\n> \n> R: (x+1, y) — right, increasing x\n> \n> Head direction is D, so last move was down, meaning from a higher y to lower y. Head is at (6,4), and since it moved down, it came from (6,5) or something? Snake positions: head (6,4), then (6,5), which is directly above since y=5 to y=4 is down. Yes.\n> \n> Now, food:\n> \n> - (6,6) with life span 4, value 1 (positive food)\n> \n> - (2,2) with life span 8, value 1 (positive food)\n> \n> Both are positive, no negative food here.\n> \n> Life span: food disappears after N turns, and countdown decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 6, for (6,6), life span 4, so it will disappear after 4 more turns? Life span is the number of turns it will last, including the current turn? Let me read.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So, at the time it's spawned, life_span = N, and each turn it decreases by 1, and when it reaches 0, it disappears. Since it decreases every turn including current, at turn t, if life_span is L, it will last for L turns, disappearing at turn t + L - 1 or something? Let's think.\n> \n> Suppose food appears at turn T with life_span N. Then at turn T, life_span is N, and it decreases each turn. After N decreases, it disappears. So it can be eaten from turn T to turn T + N - 1, inclusive? At turn T, life_span N, after turn T it becomes N-1, and so on, until life_span=0, it disappears. So the food is present for N turns: from turn T to turn T + N - 1.\n> \n> In the state, at current turn t1=6, food has a life_span given, so for (6,6), life_span=4, so it will disappear after turn 6 + 4 - 1 = turn 9? Let's clarify:\n> \n> - At turn 6, life_span=4, meaning after 4 turns, it will be gone. After turn 6, it has 3 turns left? Better to think of life_span as the remaining turns it will exist.\n> \n> \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" so at turn t, with life_span L, it decreases to L-1 at turn t+1, and so on, until L=0 at some turn.\n> \n> For (6,6): at turn 6, life_span=4, so:\n> \n> - Turn 6: life_span=4\n> \n> - Turn 7: life_span=3\n> \n> - Turn 8: life_span=2\n> \n> - Turn 9: life_span=1\n> \n> - Turn 10: life_span=0, disappears? But since it decreases after each turn, after turn 6, it becomes 3, etc.\n> \n> The food can be eaten on turns when life_span > 0.\n> \n> At turn t, with life_span L, it can be eaten on that turn if head moves to it, and then it disappears.\n> \n> After that, life_span decreases to L-1 for the next turn, but since it was eaten, it's gone.\n> \n> In this case, for (6,6), at turn 6, life_span=4, so it can be eaten on turn 6,7,8,9, and disappears after turn 9 or at turn 10? I think it's simpler: the food is available for L turns starting from now. So with L=4, it can be eaten from turn 6 to turn 9 inclusive, and disappears at turn 10.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,2) with life_span=8, so available from turn 6 to turn 13 inclusive.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan actions for turn 6 and beyond, thinking at least 5 turns ahead.\n> \n> Current head position: (6,4)\n> \n> Head direction: D (down, so moving decreasing y)\n> \n> Possible moves: I can move U, D, L, R, but with constraints.\n> \n> No instant reverse: since current direction is D, I cannot move U (up) on the next turn, because that would be opposite direction.\n> \n> Current direction is D, so I just moved down. So for next move, I cannot move up (U), because that would be reversing direction instantly.\n> \n> Allowed moves: D (continue down), L (left), or R (right). Not U.\n> \n> Also, I need to avoid walls and body collisions.\n> \n> Walls: borders x=0,7 y=0,7, and internal obstacle (1,6)\n> \n> So playable area: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except (1,6) is blocked.\n> \n> Now, snake body: positions [(6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5)]\n> \n> Head is at (6,4), body segments at (6,5), (5,5), (4,5)\n> \n> If I move, the snake moves, so the tail will also move.\n> \n> When the head moves to a new cell, and if it eats food, it grows, so the tail doesn't move; else, the tail moves forward.\n> \n> In this case, since we're moving, the positions change.\n> \n> Also, collision: if head touches any body segment except the tail, it dies. But if it touches the tail, it might be okay if the tail moves away.\n> \n> Specifically: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> But there's a special case: Tail Reward Danger—if head is adjacent to the tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and newly grown tail collide.\n> \n> I need to check that.\n> \n> First, let's find possible moves from (6,4) at turn 6.\n> \n> Possible actions:\n> \n> - U: up to (6,5) — but (6,5) is occupied by the body segment? Snake positions: (6,4) head, (6,5) is the first body segment. So moving to (6,5) would be colliding with body, which is deadly. So cannot move U to (6,5).\n> \n> - D: down to (6,3) — y decreases, so (6,4) to (6,3). Is (6,3) within bounds? y=3, since walls at y=0, y=7, so y=3 is between 1 and 6, so okay. Is it occupied? Snake positions: (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5). None at (6,3), so empty. Also not wall. So possible.\n> \n> - L: left to (5,4) — x decreases. (5,4): is it occupied? Snake has (5,5) but not (5,4). Walls: not border or obstacle. Obstacle is (1,6), not here. So (5,4) is free, so possible.\n> \n> - R: right to (7,4) — but x=7 is wall, since border x=7 is wall. So cannot move right, out of bounds.\n> \n> So possible moves: D or L.\n> \n> Cannot U (body) or R (wall).\n> \n> Now, head direction is D, so moving D is allowed, L is also allowed since not reverse.\n> \n> I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n> \n> Food available: (6,6) and (2,2)\n> \n> (6,6) is close, at (6,6), which is above the head, but head is at (6,4), so to reach (6,6), I need to go up, but currently at (6,4), moving down or left.\n> \n> (6,6) has life_span 4, so available until turn 9.\n> \n> (2,2) has life_span 8, available longer.\n> \n> Also, (6,6) might be risky because of tail reward danger? Let's see.\n> \n> First, let's consider moving D to (6,3).\n> \n> If I move D to (6,3), turn 6 action D.\n> \n> Then snake positions: head moves to (6,3), and since no food eaten, tail moves, so body: the last segment (4,5) is removed, and new positions: head (6,3), then previous head (6,4) becomes body, then (6,5), then (5,5). So snake: [(6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5)]\n> \n> Tail is at (5,5).\n> \n> Now, at turn 7, head at (6,3), direction D (since moved down).\n> \n> Possible moves: from (6,3), cannot move U (reverse, since direction is D), so can move D, L, R.\n> \n> D to (6,2): within bounds, not occupied? Snake: (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5). (6,2) free? Assuming no other snakes or obstacles, so yes.\n> \n> L to (5,3): free, not occupied.\n> \n> R to (7,3): x=7 wall, cannot.\n> \n> So possible D or L.\n> \n> If I go D, to (6,2), then later I might go further down or left, but (6,6) is up, so I might not reach it soon, and life_span is short, only until turn 9. Turn 6 to turn 9, so 4 turns including turn 6.\n> \n> At turn 6, I didn't go towards it.\n> \n> If I go L from (6,3) to (5,3), then I can go up or down or left, etc.\n> \n> But (6,6) is at y=6, I'm at y=3, so far away.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,2) is at (2,2), which is left and down.\n> \n> Now, alternative: at turn 6, move L to (5,4).\n> \n> Action L at turn 6.\n> \n> Head to (5,4).\n> \n> Since no food, tail moves, so snake: head (5,4), then previous head (6,4), then (6,5), then (5,5)? Positions: after move, head to (5,4), then the body: the segment that was at (6,4) is now part of body, but since head moved, the body follows.\n> \n> Original: before move, positions: [(6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5)]\n> \n> After moving L to (5,4): head at (5,4), then the next segment was (6,4), which is now behind, so body: (6,4) becomes the segment after head? Let's think.\n> \n> The snake moves: head to new position, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment in front.\n> \n> So: head was at (6,4), moves to (5,4).\n> \n> Then, the segment that was at (6,5) moves to where head was, (6,4).\n> \n> The segment at (5,5) moves to (6,5).\n> \n> The segment at (4,5) moves to (5,5), and since no growth, the tail (4,5) is removed, so new positions: [(5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5)]? Let's list:\n> \n> - Head: (5,4)\n> \n> - Then, the first body segment was at (6,5), but it moves to the previous position of the head, which is (6,4)\n> \n> - Then, the next body segment was at (5,5), moves to the previous position of the first body segment, which was (6,5)\n> \n> - Then, the last body segment was at (4,5), moves to the previous position of the previous, which was (5,5)\n> \n> And since no growth, we remove the tail, so the segment at (4,5) is gone, and the new tail is at (5,5).\n> \n> Positions: head (5,4), then body: (6,4), (6,5), (5,5)\n> \n> So [(5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5)]\n> \n> Now, at turn 7, head at (5,4), and since I moved left, direction is now L.\n> \n> Possible moves: cannot move R (reverse), so can move U, D, L.\n> \n> U to (5,5): but (5,5) is occupied by the tail? Snake positions: (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5). So (5,5) is the tail.\n> \n> Moving to (5,5): since it's the tail, and tail will move, so it might be safe, as long as after move, head is not colliding.\n> \n> After moving to (5,5), head at (5,5), but (5,5) was tail, now head moves there, and tail moves away.\n> \n> But in this case, (5,5) is occupied by the tail, so moving there: since tail will move, it should be okay, as per rules.\n> \n> Similarly, D to (5,3): free, not occupied.\n> \n> L to (4,4): free, not occupied.\n> \n> R to (6,4): but (6,4) is occupied by a body segment, which is not tail; (6,4) is a body segment, not tail. Tail is at (5,5).\n> \n> So moving to (6,4) would collide with body, deadly.\n> \n> So possible moves: U to (5,5), D to (5,3), L to (4,4)\n> \n> Now, if I move U to (5,5), I go to tail position. But (5,5) has no food, I think. Food is at (6,6) and (2,2), not at (5,5). So moving to (5,5) doesn't eat food, so tail moves, and head is at (5,5), which was previously tail, but since tail moves, no collision.\n> \n> New positions: head to (5,5), then body: the segment at (6,4) moves to (5,4)? Let's compute.\n> \n> Head moves to (5,5), which was tail.\n> \n> Then, the first body segment at (6,4) moves to the previous head position (5,4)? Positions before move: [(5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5)]\n> \n> After head moves to (5,5): head at (5,5)\n> \n> Then, the segment that was at (6,4) moves to where head was, (5,4)\n> \n> The segment at (6,5) moves to where the first body was, (6,4)\n> \n> The segment at (5,5) was tail, but head is moving there, so it becomes part of body, but since no food, tail is removed.\n> \n> The last segment was (5,5), which is now occupied by head, so it's gone, and the new tail is where the last body segment was, but it moved.\n> \n> New positions: head at (5,5), then the segment that was at (6,4) is now at (5,4), then segment that was at (6,5) is now at (6,4), and the segment that was at (5,5) is removed since head is there and no growth.\n> \n> So snake: [(5,5), (5,4), (6,4)]\n> \n> Is that right? Head at (5,5), then next should be (5,4), then (6,4), and (6,5) is no longer part since tail moved? Let's list:\n> \n> - Head new position: (5,5)\n> \n> - Body segments: the previous positions except tail.\n> \n> The body segments move to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> The first body segment was at (6,4), it moves to the previous position of the head, which is (5,4)\n> \n> The second body segment was at (6,5), it moves to the previous position of the first body segment, which was (6,4)\n> \n> The tail was at (5,5), but since head moved to (5,5) and no food, it is not replaced, so the tail is gone.\n> \n> So new snake: head at (5,5), then body at (5,4), then body at (6,4). But (6,4) is from (6,5) moving to (6,4)? Positions:\n> \n> - Head: (5,5)\n> \n> - Segment 1: moved to (5,4)  // from (6,4) to (5,4)\n> \n> - Segment 2: moved to (6,4)  // from (6,5) to (6,4)\n> \n> And no segment at (5,5) anymore since it was tail and not grown.\n> \n> So snake: [(5,5), (5,4), (6,4)]\n> \n> Length 3 now? Original length was 4, no food eaten, so after move, length should be 4, but we have three positions? Mistake.\n> \n> Original positions before turn 6 move: 4 segments.\n> \n> After moving head to new position, and no growth, the tail is removed, so new snake has same length, positions shifted.\n> \n> In this case, from [(5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5)] before move.\n> \n> After head moves to (5,5):\n> \n> - New head: (5,5)\n> \n> - Then, the segment that was at (6,4) moves to (5,4)  // previous head position\n> \n> - The segment that was at (6,5) moves to (6,4)  // previous position of first body\n> \n> - The segment that was at (5,5) moves to (6,5)? No, the tail at (5,5) is where head is moving, so it is consumed, but since no food, it is not grown, so the tail is removed, and the new positions are: head (5,5), body at (5,4), body at (6,4), and the last body at (6,5) moves to where? The segment at (6,5) moves to the previous position of the segment before it, which was (6,4) for the first body, but let's index.\n> \n> List positions in order: index 0: head, 1: first body, 2: second body, 3: tail.\n> \n> Before move: pos0: (5,4), pos1: (6,4), pos2: (6,5), pos3: (5,5)\n> \n> After head moves to (5,5): new pos0: (5,5)\n> \n> Then new pos1: the previous pos0, which is (5,4)\n> \n> New pos2: the previous pos1, which is (6,4)\n> \n> New pos3: the previous pos2, which is (6,5)\n> \n> But previous pos3 was (5,5), which is not used, and since no growth, we don't add a new segment, so the tail is new pos3: (6,5)\n> \n> So snake: [(5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5)]\n> \n> But (6,5) is the tail.\n> \n> And (5,5) is head, which was previously tail position, but now it's head, and tail is at (6,5), so no collision.\n> \n> Back to turn 6 choices.\n> \n> At turn 6, I can move D to (6,3) or L to (5,4).\n> \n> If I move L to (5,4), as above, then at turn 7, I can move U, D, or L from (5,4).\n> \n> But let's think about the food at (6,6).\n> \n> (6,6) is at (6,6), which is above the current head position (6,4).

Also, an internal obstacle at (1,6). So, the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), and walls block those cells.\n> - **Snake Positions**: Head is at (5,4), then body segments at (6,4), (6,5), (5,5). So the snake is shaped like it turned left from right or something. Let's plot this:\n> - Head: (5,4)\n> - Segment 1: (6,4)  // right of head\n> - Segment 2: (6,5)  // up from previous\n> - Segment 3: (5,5)  // left from previous, so it's a sort of square or something. Positions: (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5). So it's like the head is at bottom-left, then it went right to (6,4), then up to (6,5), then left to (5,5). But (5,5) is above the head? (5,4) and (5,5) are adjacent vertically.\n> \n> Actually, let's list coordinates:\n> \n> - (5,4) head\n> - (6,4) // east\n> - (6,5) // north\n> - (5,5) // west\n> \n> So the snake is in a \"hook\" shape. Head at (5,4), facing left (since head direction is L). Head direction is given as L, meaning it moved left to get to (5,4) from previous position? Head direction is the direction it's facing, which is left, so it came from the right. Since positions are head first, the previous move was into (5,4) from (6,4)? But (6,4) is the first body segment.\n> \n> Snake positions: [(5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5)] so head is (5,4), and it moved to this position from (6,4), since (6,4) is next, so it moved left to (5,4). Head direction is L, which matches.\n> \n> Now, food:\n> \n> - Food at (6,6) with life span 3, value 1 (positive)\n> - Food at (2,2) with life span 7, value 1 (positive)\n> - Food at (2,1) with life span 10, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> All food is positive, no negative food mentioned. Value is +1 for all, and life span given.\n> \n> Life span decreases every turn, including current turn. So at turn 7, life span 3 means it will disappear after 3 more turns? Life span is the number of turns it remains, including the current turn. So for food at (6,6) with life span 3 on turn 7, it will disappear after turn 9? Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So, on turn t, a food with life span L will disappear after turn t + L - 1? For example, if L=3 on turn 7, it decreases to 2 on turn 8, to 1 on turn 9, and gone on turn 10? But \"disappears after N turns\" might mean it lasts for N turns from now.\n> \n> I think it's better to think: at the start of turn t, food has life span L, it will be there for turns t, t+1, ..., t+L-1, and gone on turn t+L. But since countdown decreases every turn including current, on turn t, life span is L, meaning it has L turns left including this one.\n> \n> For (6,6): life span 3 on turn 7, so it will be available on turns 7,8,9, and disappear on turn 10.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,2) life span 7 on turn 7, available turns 7 to 13.\n> \n> (2,1) life span 10, available turns 7 to 16.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (5,4), facing left. Possible moves: since head direction is L, it can move left, up, or down? Movement constraints: I can choose U, D, L, R, but no instant reverse. Since it's facing left, moving right would be reverse, which is not allowed. So from current position and direction, possible moves are: L (continue left), U (up), D (down). Not R, because that would be opposite to current direction.\n> \n> Current head position: (5,4)\n> \n> - Move L: to (4,4)\n> - Move U: to (5,5)\n> - Move D: to (5,3)\n> \n> But (5,5) is occupied by the tail? Snake positions: (5,4) head, (6,4), (6,5), (5,5) tail.\n> \n> (5,5) is the last segment, which is the tail.\n> \n> If I move to (5,5), is that allowed? Generally, moving to the tail is allowed because when the snake moves, the tail also moves, so the head can move to where the tail was, and they won't collide because tail moves away.\n> \n> But there's a special case: **Tail Reward Danger**: If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail collide.\n> \n> First, let's see what cells are occupied.\n> \n> Snake body: (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5). So all these cells are occupied by snake, except the head can move to tail if no food or with care.\n> \n> Now, food is at (6,6), (2,2), (2,1). None of these are under the snake body currently? Let's see: (6,6) is not occupied, (2,2), (2,1) not occupied. Snake is at (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5). (5,5) is occupied, but no food there. Food is elsewhere.\n> \n> (6,6) is one cell away from (6,5), etc.\n> \n> First, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score, prioritizing long-term survival.\n> \n> Current snake length: 4 segments.\n> \n> I need to eat food to grow.\n> \n> Available food: (6,6) with short life, (2,2) and (2,1) with longer life.\n> \n> (6,6) is at (6,6), which is near the snake. Snake head at (5,4).\n> \n> Distance to (6,6): from (5,4) to (6,6) is |6-5| + |6-4| = 1 + 2 = 3 Manhattan distance, but with obstacles.\n> \n> Possible paths.\n> \n> First, let's list all cells: grid from (0,0) to (7,7), walls at borders and (1,6).\n> \n> So, cells: x from 0 to 7, but x=0 and x=7 are walls, y=0 and y=7 walls. Also (1,6) wall.\n> \n> So movable cells: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, except (1,6) is wall, so not accessible.\n> \n> (1,6) is given as internal obstacle, so it's a wall cell.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (5,4), facing left.\n> \n> Possible moves this turn (turn 7):\n> \n> - Left (L) to (4,4)\n> \n> - Up (U) to (5,5)\n> \n> - Down (D) to (5,3)\n> \n> Now, (5,5) is currently occupied by the tail. But since it's the tail, moving to (5,5) is generally safe, as the tail will move away when the snake advances. However, if there is food on (5,5), it could be dangerous, but there is no food there now. Food is elsewhere.\n> \n> In this case, no food on (5,5), so moving to (5,5) should be safe. The snake would grow only if it eats food, but here no food, so moving to (5,5) means the head goes to where the tail was, and since no food, the tail doesn't grow, so the tail moves off, and head is at (5,5), body segments shift: new positions would be head at (5,5), then (5,4), (6,4), (6,5). (5,5) was tail, now head is there, and (6,5) becomes the new tail or something. Let's simulate.\n> \n> Current positions: turn 7: head (5,4), body (6,4), (6,5), tail (5,5)\n> \n> If I move U to (5,5):\n> \n> - New head position: (5,5)\n> \n> - Then the body: since head moved to previous tail, and no food eaten, so snake doesn't grow, so the tail segment is removed, and new body is: head at (5,5), then previous head (5,4), then (6,4), and (6,5) is removed? Standard snake movement: when moving, head goes to new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead.\n> \n> So positions: index 0: head, 1: next, etc.\n> \n> After move U to (5,5):\n> \n> - New head: (5,5)\n> \n> - Segment 1 moves to where head was: (5,4)\n> \n> - Segment 2 moves to where segment 1 was: (6,4)\n> \n> - Segment 3 (tail) moves to where segment 2 was: (6,5)\n> \n> But segment 2 was at (6,5)? Current positions: [ (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5) ]\n> \n> - Head at (5,4)\n> \n> - Segment 1: (6,4)\n> \n> - Segment 2: (6,5)\n> \n> - Segment 3 (tail): (5,5)\n> \n> After moving head to (5,5):\n> \n> - New head: (5,5)\n> \n> - Segment 1 moves to old head position: (5,4)\n> \n> - Segment 2 moves to old segment 1 position: (6,4)\n> \n> - Segment 3 moves to old segment 2 position: (6,5)\n> \n> Old segment 2 position is (6,5), so segment 3 moves to (6,5), but that's where segment 2 was, so now segment 3 is at (6,5), and segment 2 is at (6,4)? Let's list new positions:\n> \n> - Head: (5,5)\n> \n> - Segment 1: (5,4)  // from old head\n> \n> - Segment 2: (6,4)  // from old segment 1\n> \n> - Segment 3: (6,5)  // from old segment 2\n> \n> But old segment 2 was (6,5), so segment 3 moves to (6,5), which is the same cell? No, segment 3 was at (5,5), which is now head, so segment 3 moves to where segment 2 was, which is (6,5).\n> \n> And (6,5) was occupied by segment 2, but segment 2 moves to (6,4), so (6,5) is now free for segment 3 to move into.\n> \n> New positions: head at (5,5), segment at (5,4), segment at (6,4), segment at (6,5). So the snake is now at (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5). But (6,5) is the tail.\n> \n> Importantly, the cell (5,5) was the tail, but now it's the head, and no collision because the tail moved away.\n> \n> If there was food on (5,5), and I moved there, I would eat it and grow, so the tail doesn't move, and head is on food, but since it's the tail position, it might cause collision if head is adjacent, but in this case, no food, so no issue.\n> \n> Back to moves.\n> \n> Also, walls: (5,5) is within bounds, not wall. (5,3) down, y=3, which is above y=0, so ok. (4,4) left, x=4, not border.\n> \n> Now, for each move, I need to think about future turns.\n> \n> First, food at (6,6) is close but has short life span. Life span 3 on turn 7, so available only until turn 9. If I want to eat it, I need to reach it by turn 9.\n> \n> From (5,4) to (6,6): one way is to go up to (5,5), but (5,5) is occupied, but I can move there, as above. From (5,5), I can then go to (6,5) or (5,6) or (4,5), etc.\n> \n> But (6,5) is currently a body segment, but after move, it might be different.\n> \n> Let's think step by step.\n> \n> Also, there is food at (2,2) and (2,1) which are far, but longer life.\n> \n> Prioritize long-term survival, so I need to avoid dead ends and ensure I have space to move.\n> \n> First, let's assess the current area.\n> \n> Grid: walls at borders, so playable area is x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, except (1,6) is wall.\n> \n> So available cells: all (x,y) with 1<=x<=6, 1<=y<=6, except (1,6) is blocked.\n> \n> Now, snake occupies: (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5) — that's four cells.\n> \n> After any move, the snake will occupy different cells.\n> \n> I should consider going for the near food or not.\n> \n> (6,6) is at (6,6), which is adjacent to (6,5), but (6,5) is currently a body segment.\n> \n> If I move up to (5,5), then from there, I can go to (6,5) or other.\n> \n> After moving U to (5,5), new positions: head at (5,5), body at (5,4), (6,4), (6,5) as tail.\n> \n> Now, from (5,5), possible moves: U to (5,6), D to (5,4) but (5,4) is occupied by body, L to (4,5), R to (6,5) but (6,5) is tail.\n> \n> Moving to (6,5) is moving to the tail cell, which is safe if no food, but there is no food there.\n> \n> If I move R to (6,5), since it's the tail, and no food, it should be ok. Head moves to (6,5), then body shifts: head to (6,5), segment 1 to (5,5), segment 2 to (5,4), segment 3 to (6,4). New tail at (6,4).\n> \n> Then from (6,5), I can go to (6,6) to eat the food.\n> \n> But (6,6) has food with value 1, positive.\n> \n> If I go to (6,6) from (6,5), I move to (6,6), eat food, so snake grows: new head at (6,6), body: previous head (6,5) becomes new segment, then (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), and tail stays or new segment added? When eating, the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move, or a new segment is added.\n> \n> Standard: when head moves to food, it eats it, so the length increases by one, meaning the tail doesn't move that turn.\n> \n> So positions: before move to (6,6), suppose at some turn, head at (6,5), body at (5,5), (5,4), (6,4) — let's say after previous moves.\n> \n> If head at (6,5) and I move R to (6,6), which has food.\n> \n> New head at (6,6), and since food eaten, a new segment is added at the tail, so the body is: head (6,6), then previous positions: the segment that was at head position becomes body, so (6,5) becomes new body segment, then the rest: (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), and since growth, the tail (6,4) stays, and new segment is added, so positions: head (6,6), then (6,5), then (5,5), then (5,4), then (6,4). Length 5 now.\n> \n> But (6,4) was the tail, and it stays, so no issue with collision.\n> \n> But in this case, from current position, to reach (6,6) quickly.\n> \n> But life span: it has to be eaten by turn 9.\n> \n> Turn 7: I can move U to (5,5), then turn 8: from (5,5) move R to (6,5), then turn 9: from (6,5) move U to (6,6) to eat.\n> \n> On turn 9, it can be eaten, and life span was 3 on turn 7, so on turn 8, life span 2, turn 9 life span 1, so it can be eaten on turn 9.\n> \n> If I go directly, but from (5,4) I can't go directly to (6,6) in one move.\n> \n> Other moves: if I move D to (5,3), then I'm farther.\n> \n> Or L to (4,4).\n> \n> But let's consider the tail reward danger.\n> \n> Currently, head at (5,4), tail at (5,5), which are adjacent? (5,4) and (5,5) are adjacent vertically, so head is adjacent to tail.\n> \n> Is that right?

It's turn 8. The grid has walls at the borders, so x from 0 to 7 and y from 0 to 7, meaning it's an 8x8 grid. There's also an internal obstacle at (1,6).\n> \n> The snake positions are: head at (4,4), then body segments at (5,4), (6,4), and tail at (6,5). So the snake has 4 segments. Head direction is left (L), which means it was moving left to get to (4,4) from (5,4)? Let me trace the positions: the list is [(4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5)]. Since head is at (4,4) and direction is L, that makes sense because moving left from (5,4) to (4,4).\n> \n> Now, food items:\n> \n> - (6,6) with life span 2 and value 1 (positive food)\n> \n> - (2,2) with life span 6 and value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (2,1) with life span 9 and value 1 (positive)\n> \n> All food is positive; no negative food here. Value is +1 for all, and life span is given.\n> \n> Life span decreases every turn, including the current turn. So at turn 8, for (6,6) life span is 2, meaning it will disappear after turn 9? Let's clarify: \"life_span\" is the number of turns it remains, including the current turn. So if life_span is N at turn t, it disappears after turn t + N - 1? I need to be careful.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So for food at (6,6) with life_span=2 at turn 8:\n> \n> - At turn 8, life_span=2\n> \n> - After turn 8, countdown decreases to 1\n> \n> - After turn 9, countdown decreases to 0, so it disappears before turn 10? Let's think.\n> \n> Typically, \"disappears after N turns\" might mean it lasts for N turns starting from now.\n> \n> But it says: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so at the start of turn t, if life_span is L, after the turn, it decreases by 1. If L reaches 0, it disappears before the next turn.\n> \n> The rule: \"Disappears after N turns\" – I think it means it will disappear after N more turns, including this one.\n> \n> But to be precise: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> Assume that at the beginning of turn t, food has life_span L. After the turn, L decreases by 1. If L becomes 0, the food is removed before the next turn.\n> \n> For (6,6): at turn 8, life_span=2. After turn 8, it decreases to 1. After turn 9, it decreases to 0 and disappears, so it can be eaten on turn 8 or turn 9.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,2): life_span=6 at turn 8, so it will last until after turn 13? Let's calculate:\n> \n> - Turn 8: L=6\n> \n> - After turn 8: L=5\n> \n> - After turn 9: L=4\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - After turn 13: L=0, disappears before turn 14.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,1): L=9 at turn 8, disappears after turn 16 or so.\n> \n> Now, snake head is at (4,4), direction L (left). So possible moves from (4,4): since direction is L, it can move L (left), U (up), D (down), but not R (right) because that would be instant reverse, which is not allowed. Rule: \"No instant reverse\": cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\n> \n> Current direction is L, so cannot move R.\n> \n> Possible moves from (4,4):\n> \n> - Left (L): to (3,4)\n> \n> - Up (U): to (4,5)\n> \n> - Down (D): to (4,3)\n> \n> Now, I need to check for collisions and walls.\n> \n> Walls: border walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Also internal obstacle at (1,6).\n> \n> So, (3,4): is it within bounds? x=3 between 1 and 6? x from 0 to 7, so x=3 is valid, y=4 valid. No wall at (3,4) as per given, only borders and (1,6).\n> \n> (4,5): x=4, y=5, should be fine.\n> \n> (4,3): x=4, y=3, fine.\n> \n> Now, snake body: positions are (4,4) head, (5,4), (6,4), (6,5) tail.\n> \n> If I move to (3,4), is it occupied by body? Body segments are (5,4), (6,4), (6,5). (3,4) is not in the list, so no collision.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,5): not in body positions.\n> \n> (4,3): not in body positions.\n> \n> Also, walls: no issue.\n> \n> But I need to think ahead 5+ turns to maximize score and avoid risks.\n> \n> Food locations:\n> \n> - (6,6): near the tail area, life span short, only 2 turns left including current? At turn 8, L=2, so can be eaten on turn 8 or 9.\n> \n> - (2,2): far, L=6, so plenty of time\n> \n> - (2,1): also far, L=9\n> \n> Now, snake is at (4,4), moving left to (3,4) might be an option.\n> \n> But let's see the grid layout.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. So 8x8.\n> \n> Obstacle at (1,6), which might block paths.\n> \n> Snake: head (4,4), body (5,4), (6,4), tail (6,5). So the snake is like: from (4,4) left, but (5,4) is right of head, since head is at (4,4) and (5,4) is next, meaning the body is to the east? Positions list: index 0 is head, index 1 is first body segment, etc.\n> \n> So from head (4,4), the neck is (5,4), which is to the east, so the snake was moving west to (4,4), so direction L is consistent.\n> \n> Now, tail is at (6,5). If the snake moves, the tail will move when the head moves, but only if it doesn't eat food. When it eats food, it grows, so tail doesn't move.\n> \n> Rule: when eating positive food, length increases by 1, so tail stays in place, and new segment added.\n> \n> But for movement, when snake moves, if no food eaten, tail moves forward, so the cell that was tail is freed.\n> \n> In this case, if snake moves to a new cell, and no food, the tail (6,5) will move to where? The body moves: head to new position, each segment moves to the previous position of the segment before it.\n> \n> So if head moves to (3,4), then (5,4) becomes the new position for the segment that was at (5,4), but it moves to where head was? Let's think.\n> \n> After move: new head position, then the old head becomes the new neck, and so on, tail moves off the old tail position.\n> \n> Specifically: if head moves to new cell, then the segment that was at index 1 moves to index 0's old position, index 2 to index 1's old position, etc., and the last segment (tail) is removed from its position.\n> \n> But when eating food, a new segment is added at the tail position, so tail doesn't move, and length increases.\n> \n> For now, no food eaten, so if snake moves, tail moves from (6,5) to the previous position of the segment before it, which is (6,4)? Positions: indices: 0: (4,4) head, 1: (5,4), 2: (6,4), 3: (6,5) tail.\n> \n> If head moves to (3,4), then new positions: head at (3,4), then segment that was at index 0 moves to? No: the body segments move to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> After move: new head at (3,4), then the first body segment is at old head position (4,4), second body at old first body position (5,4), and tail at old second body position (6,4). The old tail position (6,5) is now empty.\n> \n> Similarly, if head moves up to (4,5), new head (4,5), body at (4,4), (5,4), tail at (6,4) — since tail moves to (6,4), and (6,5) freed.\n> \n> If down to (4,3), similar.\n> \n> Now, food at (6,6): if snake can get there, it might eat it.\n> \n> But (6,6) is adjacent to current tail (6,5)? (6,5) is tail, (6,6) is one cell south? y=6, assuming y increases up or down?\n> \n> Coordinate system: U is (x,y+1), so y increases up, I assume, like standard coordinates.\n> \n> In the movement: U (x,y+1), so y+1 is up, y-1 is down, so y=0 bottom, y=7 top? Let's confirm.\n> \n> Typically in grids, (0,0) is bottom-left or top-left? But here, movement U (x,y+1) suggests that y increases as we go up, so (0,0) might be bottom-left, (0,7) top-left, etc.\n> \n> But walls: y=0 and y=7, so y=0 is bottom row, y=7 top row.\n> \n> Similarly, x=0 left, x=7 right.\n> \n> Food at (6,6): x=6, y=6, which is near top-right.\n> \n> Current tail at (6,5), which is directly below (6,6) since y=5 vs y=6, so (6,5) is south of (6,6).\n> \n> If snake moves towards (6,6), but head is at (4,4), so it's not close.\n> \n> (6,6) has short life span, only 2 turns left: can be eaten on turn 8 or 9.\n> \n> To eat it on turn 8, head would need to be at (6,6) now, but head is at (4,4), not adjacent, so impossible to eat on turn 8.\n> \n> On turn 9: if head moves to (6,6) on turn 9.\n> \n> But from (4,4), it takes multiple moves to get to (6,6). Minimum moves: from (4,4) to (6,6) is 2 steps right and 2 up, or similar, but since head can only move one cell per turn, it would take at least |6-4| + |6-4| = 4 moves if no obstacles, so earliest turn 12? Turn 8: at (4,4), after move turn 8 to say (5,4) or something, but let's not jump.\n> \n> At turn 8, head at (4,4). To reach (6,6), need to go east and north.\n> \n> But current direction is L (left, west), so moving right (east) is reverse, not allowed on next turn.\n> \n> So from (4,4), possible moves: L to (3,4), U to (4,5), D to (4,3).\n> \n> None of these get closer to (6,6) immediately. (3,4) is west, away; (4,5) north, but (6,6) is north-east; (4,3) south, away.\n> \n> So it will take at least 3 or 4 moves to reach (6,6), but by then, the food will be gone. Life span: at turn 8, L=2, so after turn 8, L=1; after turn 9, L=0 and disappears. So it can only be eaten on turn 8 or 9, but on turn 8 impossible, on turn 9 possible only if head is at (6,6) on turn 9.\n> \n> To be at (6,6) on turn 9, the head must be at a cell adjacent to (6,6) on turn 8, and move to it on turn 9.\n> \n> Adjacent cells to (6,6): (5,6), (6,5), (7,6), (6,7). But walls: x=7 and y=7 are walls, so (7,6) and (6,7) are invalid or walls? Walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so (7,6) is on x=7, which is wall, so invalid. Similarly (6,7) is y=7, wall. So only possible adjacent cells are (5,6) and (6,5).\n> \n> (6,5) is currently occupied by the tail.\n> \n> Now, on turn 8, head is at (4,4), which is not adjacent to (6,6). The closest it can be to (6,6) on turn 8 is if it moves, but from (4,4), in one move, it can go to (3,4), (4,5), or (4,3), none of which are adjacent to (6,6). (4,5) is at distance |6-4| + |6-5| = 2+1=3, not adjacent. Similarly others are farther.\n> \n> So impossible to reach (6,6) by turn 9. Therefore, the food at (6,6) cannot be eaten; it will disappear after turn 9 without being eaten. So we should ignore it.\n> \n> Now, other food: (2,2) and (2,1), both with longer life spans.\n> \n> (2,2): L=6 at turn 8, so can be eaten until turn 13 or so, as I calculated earlier.\n> \n> Similarly (2,1): L=9, plenty of time.\n> \n> Now, (2,1) is at (2,1), which is near bottom-left, and (2,2) is one above it.\n> \n> Snake is at (4,4), so need to go west and south to reach there.\n> \n> Also, there is an internal obstacle at (1,6), but (1,6) is top-left area, while (2,1) and (2,2) are bottom-left, so might not directly affect, but could block paths.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan a path to eat food while avoiding collisions and thinking long-term.\n> \n> First, let's sketch the grid:\n> \n> - Walls: borders, and (1,6) occupied.\n> \n> - Snake: head (4,4), body (5,4), (6,4), tail (6,5)\n> \n> - Food: (6,6) but we ignore, (2,2), (2,1)\n> \n> Since (6,6) is not reachable, focus on the other food.\n> \n> Possible moves from current position (4,4):\n> \n> - Left (L) to (3,4)\n> \n> - Up (U) to (4,5)\n> \n> - Down (D) to (4,3)\n> \n> Now, after moving, the snake body changes.\n> \n> Also, need to consider future positions and food.\n> \n> Moreover, the food at (2,1) and (2,2) are close to each other, so we might eat both.\n> \n> But (2,2) has shorter life span (6 turns) compared to (2,1) with 9, so perhaps prioritize (2,2) first.\n> \n> L=6 at turn 8, so it disappears after turn 13, meaning last chance to eat on turn 13.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,1) disappears after turn 16.\n> \n> Now, distance from (4,4) to (2,2): |4-2| + |4-2| = 2+2=4, so minimum 4 moves.\n> \n> Similarly to (2,1): |4-2| + |4-1| = 2+3=5 moves.\n> \n> But with obstacles, might take more.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (1,6), but that's far from (2,2), so probably not an issue for going to (2,2).\n> \n> (2,2) is at x=2,y=2; (1,6) is x=1,y=6, so different area.\n> \n> Paths to (2,2):\n> \n> One way is to go west then south, or south then west, etc.\n> \n> But need to avoid walls and body.\n> \n> Current body positions: (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5)\n> \n> If we move, these change.\n> \n> Also, tail is at (6,5), which might move.\n> \n> Now, let's think about the direction and possible paths.\n> \n> Since head direction is L, and we want to go west, moving left might be good.\n> \n> But let's simulate moves.\n> \n> First, turn 8: we need to choose action.\n> \n> Options:\n> \n> 1.

That means the grid goes from (0,0) to (7,7), I think. x=0 and x=7 are walls, so the playable area is from x=1 to x=6? Let me confirm.\n> \n> The walls are border cells: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So yes, the grid is 8x8, but cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, so the snake can move from (1,1) to (6,6), I assume. x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? Let's see: walls at x=0 and x=7, so x=1 to x=6 are free, similarly y=1 to y=6. But food is at (6,6), which might be on the border? (6,6): x=6, y=6. Since x=7 is wall, x=6 should be free, but it's adjacent to wall. Similarly, y=6 is free. Walls are at x=0 and x=7, so x=1 to x=6 are free cells. Similarly for y. So playable area: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6. (1,1) to (6,6).\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (1,6). So that cell is blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (3,4), then (4,4), (5,4), (6,4). So it's horizontal, left to right, but head direction is L, which is left. Head direction is L, meaning it was moving left last turn? Let's see: positions are (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4). If head is at (3,4) and direction is L, that means it was moving left to (3,4) from, say, (4,4)? But positions are given as (3,4), (4,4), etc., with head first. So at turn 9, head is at (3,4), and it came from (4,4) because direction is L, so it moved left to (3,4). So the body is from head (3,4) to tail (6,4).\n> \n> Food:\n> \n> - (6,6) value 1, life span 1. So it disappears after 1 turn, meaning it will disappear after this turn or next?

Let's read carefully.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So for food at (6,6,1,1), life span 1, so at turn 9, countdown is 1.

But since we have current turn, and life span, we need to see when it vanishes.\n> \n> \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so at the turn it appears, countdown is N, then each turn it decreases by one, and when it reaches 0, it disappears.\n> \n> For (6,6,1,1), life span 1, so at turn 9, countdown is 1. After turn 9, when we move to turn 10, countdown would be 0, so it disappears before turn 10. So on turn 9, it is present, and can be eaten on turn 9 if head moves there.

Rule: when eating positive food, length +1, so when I move to food, I eat it, head moves to that cell, and since I eat, the tail does not move, so the snake grows by one.\n> \n> Standard snake: when you eat, you grow, so the tail stays, and a new segment is added.\n> \n> From the description: \"Length of snake +1\" for positive food.\n> \n> So, when head moves to food cell, it eats, and the snake grows, meaning that the tail does not move that turn.\n> \n> Otherwise, when not eating, tail moves.\n> \n> So, in this case, if I move to (2,2) on turn 11 from (3,2), I eat the food at (2,2), so head moves to (2,2), and the tail remains, so the snake becomes: head (2,2), then previous head (3,2), then (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), and tail (5,4) stays? Positions: before move, at turn 10 end, after move to (3,2), snake positions: head (3,2), then (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), tail (5,4)? After moving to (3,2), the positions are: head (3,2), then the previous positions minus tail? When snake moves, head to new position, each segment moves to previous position of the one before.\n> \n> Start: positions [(3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (5,4)] head (3,3)\n> \n> After move down to (3,2): head moves to (3,2), then the body: the segment that was at (3,3) moves to where head was? No.\n> \n> Standard: when moving, the head moves to new cell, and each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> So, from [(3,3) head, (3,4) seg1, (4,4) seg2, (5,4) tail]\n> \n> After move down to (3,2): new head at (3,2), then seg1 moves to (3,3), seg2 moves to (3,4), tail moves to (4,4)? Positions: head (3,2), then body: (3,3), (3,4), (4,4). Tail was (5,4), but it moves to (4,4) since seg2 was at (4,4) and moves to where seg1 was, which is (3,4)? Let's index.\n> \n> Let S0 = head, S1, S2, S3 = tail.\n> \n> At turn start: S0=(3,3), S1=(3,4), S2=(4,4), S3=(5,4)\n> \n> After move to new head position, say N.\n> \n> Then new positions: head at N, S0 moves to N, so S1 moves to old S0 position, S2 moves to old S1 position, S3 moves to old S2 position.\n> \n> Old S0 was (3,3), so after move, S1 moves to (3,3), S2 moves to old S1 position (3,4)?

S3 is tail at (4,4).\n> \n> Previously tail was at (5,4), now at (4,4), so tail moved.\n> \n> But (5,4) is now empty.\n> \n> If I then move to (2,2) from (3,2) on turn 11.\n> \n> At turn 11 start, positions: head (3,2), body (3,3), (3,4), (4,4)\n> \n> Move left to (2,2): (2,2) has food, so I eat it.\n> \n> New head at (2,2), and since I eat, the tail does not move, so the snake grows: positions become head (2,2), then previous head (3,2), then (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), and tail stays, so new segment at (4,4)? When eating, head moves to food, and a new segment is added at the tail position, so tail doesn't move.\n> \n> So new positions: head (2,2), then the body from before: (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), and tail (4,4) remains, but since we add a segment, the tail is now the new segment at old tail position.\n> \n> After move without eating: if not food, head to new, each segment moves, tail moves away.\n> \n> With eating: head to new, segments move, but tail does not move, so the segment that was tail stays, and a new segment is added there? No.\n> \n> Typically: when you eat, you grow, so after moving the head, the tail does not advance, so the snake has one more segment.\n> \n> Positions: after moving head to new position, the body segments shift, but if you eat, the last position (the old tail position) is not removed, so it becomes part of the body.\n> \n> In this case:\n> \n> At turn 11 start: positions H=(3,2), B1=(3,3), B2=(3,4), T=(4,4)\n> \n> Move to (2,2), which has food, so eat.\n> \n> New head at (2,2)\n> \n> Then, the body: B1 moves to old H position (3,2), B2 moves to old B1 position (3,3), but T does not move, so T stays at (4,4), and since we eat, we add a new segment, so the tail is now at (4,4), and the new segment is added? No.\n> \n> The positions become: head (2,2), then the first body segment at previous head position (3,2), then second body at previous B1 position (3,3), then third body at previous B2 position (3,4), and tail at previous T position (4,4), but since we ate, we add one segment, so now there is an additional segment at the end.\n> \n> So snake grows to 5 segments: head (2,2), seg1 (3,2), seg2 (3,3), seg3 (3,4), tail (4,4)\n> \n> Previously it was 4 segments, after eating, 5 segments.\n> \n> Yes.\n> \n> Then direction is left.\n> \n> Now, back to turn 10.\n> \n> If I move down to (3,2) on turn 10, then on turn 11 I can move left to (2,2) to eat the food.\n> \n> But is that good?

Since it moved to (3,2) from (3,1) or something? Positions: head at (3,2), and next is (3,3), so if head is at (3,2) and direction is D, that means it's facing down, so it came from above, from (3,3) to (3,2)? But (3,3) is the first body segment, so the head was at (3,3) before moving down to (3,2). Let's list the positions in order: index 0: head (3,2), index 1: (3,3), index 2: (3,4), index 3: (4,4). So from turn 10 to 11, head moved from (3,3) to (3,2) direction down, and the body followed, so (3,4) moved to (3,3), and (4,4) moved to (3,4)? No, the tail is at (4,4), so when head moves to (3,2), the segment that was at (3,3) moves to where head was? Standard snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead.\n> \n> So at turn 10, positions might have been: head (3,3), then (3,4), (4,4), and maybe (4,3) or something, but here only 4 segments. From positions: at turn 11, head (3,2), body (3,3), (3,4), (4,4). So before move, at turn 10: head was at (3,3), body segments at (3,4), (4,4), and since it moved down, the new head is (3,2), and the tail was at (4,4), which might have been added when food was eaten.\n> \n> But for now, I don't need the history. Current snake: head at (3,2) facing down.\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (2,2) with value 1, life span 4\n> \n> - (2,1) with value 1, life span 6\n> \n> - (1,1) with value 1, life span 9\n> \n> All food has value +1, so all positive food, no negative food mentioned. Value is 1 for all, and life span given.\n> \n> Life span decreases every turn, including current turn. So at turn 11, for (2,2) life span 4, meaning it will disappear after 4 more turns, so turns 11,12,13,14 it exists, gone on turn 15? Life span decreases each turn, so at turn t, if life span is L, it will last for L turns including t, so disappears after L turns.\n> \n> For (2,2): life span 4 at turn 11, so it will be there for turns 11,12,13,14, and disappear on turn 15.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,1): life span 6, so turns 11 to 16, disappear turn 17.\n> \n> (1,1): life span 9, turns 11 to 19, disappear turn 20.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan actions for at least 5 turns: from turn 11 to, say, turn 15 or 16.\n> \n> Current head position: (3,2), direction down.\n> \n> Possible moves: U (up, to (3,3)), D (down, to (3,1)), L (left, to (2,2)), R (right, to (4,2)).\n> \n> But movement constraints: no instant reverse. Current direction is D (down), so I cannot move up (U) immediately, because that would be reverse. Reverse of down is up, so moving up is not allowed. Only possible moves are D, L, R. Down, left, or right.\n> \n> Down: to (3,1)\n> \n> Left: to (2,2)\n> \n> Right: to (4,2)\n> \n> Now, I need to check if these cells are safe.\n> \n> First, walls: border walls x=0,7 y=0,7, so (3,1): y=1, which is not 0, so it's within bounds, no wall. Similarly, (2,2) and (4,2) are both within 1 to 6, so no border walls. Internal obstacle: (1,6), which is not near, so all these cells are free of walls.\n> \n> Now, body collision: snake body segments are at (3,3), (3,4), (4,4).\n> \n> (3,1): not occupied by body, so safe.\n> \n> (2,2): not occupied by body, body is at (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), so (2,2) is free.\n> \n> (4,2): similarly free.\n> \n> But (2,2) has food! So moving left to (2,2) would eat the food.\n> \n> Similarly, other positions: (3,1) has no food, (4,2) has no food.\n> \n> Food is at (2,2), (2,1), (1,1). So (2,2) has food with value +1.\n> \n> If I move to (2,2), I eat the food, snake length increases by 1, so after eating, snake will have 5 segments.\n> \n> But I need to think about tail reward danger.\n> \n> Tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> Currently, tail is at (4,4). Head is at (3,2). Are they adjacent? Let's see distance: |dx| + |dy| = |3-4| + |2-4| = 1 + 2 = 3, not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing an edge, so up, down, left, right.\n> \n> Head (3,2), tail (4,4): not adjacent; (3,2) and (4,4) are diagonal, not adjacent. Adjacent cells would be like (3,2) and (3,3), or (3,2) and (4,2), etc.\n> \n> Specifically, (3,2) and (4,4) are not adjacent; the adjacent cells to head are (3,3) up, (3,1) down, (2,2) left, (4,2) right.\n> \n> Tail is at (4,4), which is not adjacent to head. So no tail reward danger here.\n> \n> Therefore, moving to (2,2) seems good; I eat the food, get +1 score, and grow.\n> \n> But I need to think long-term. Life span of (2,2) is 4, but since I'm on turn 11, I can eat it now.\n> \n> Similarly, there are other foods.\n> \n> But let's consider the options.\n> \n> Option 1: Move left to (2,2), eat food immediately.\n> \n> Then, on turn 11, head moves to (2,2), eats food, so new snake positions: head at (2,2), then body: the previous head position (3,2) becomes body, so segments: (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), and since ate food, a new segment is added where tail was? When you eat food, the tail doesn't move, so the snake grows by adding a segment at the tail end.\n> \n> Standard: when head moves to a food cell, the snake grows, so the tail stays in place for that turn, and a new segment is added.\n> \n> So after eating, positions: head at (2,2), then the body includes (3,2) which was head, then (3,3), (3,4), and tail at (4,4) remains since it doesn't move, so segments: [(2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4)].\n> \n> Tail was at (4,4), and since we ate food, it stays, so the new tail is still (4,4) for now? No.\n> \n> When head moves to food, the head occupies the food cell, and the body moves as usual except the tail doesn't retract, so the snake grows by one segment.\n> \n> So previous positions: head (3,2), body (3,3), (3,4), tail (4,4)\n> \n> After moving head to (2,2) and eating food:\n> \n> - New head: (2,2)\n> \n> - Body: the first body segment moves to where head was, (3,2)\n> \n> - Then next to where first body was, (3,3)\n> \n> - Then next to where second body was, (3,4)\n> \n> - And since ate food, tail doesn't move, so a new segment is added at the previous tail position? No, the tail position remains, so the segment that was tail stays, and we add a new segment at that position, so now there are five segments: head (2,2), then (3,2), then (3,3), then (3,4), then (4,4) as tail.\n> \n> (4,4) is still tail, and it didn't move.\n> \n> Now, direction: head moved left, so new direction is L.\n> \n> Now, for future turns, I need to plan.\n> \n> But I should consider other moves.\n> \n> Option 2: Move down to (3,1). No food there, so no growth. Snake moves: head to (3,1), body to (3,2), then (3,3), then (3,4) to where? Tail was (4,4), moves to (3,4)? Let's see: positions after move: head (3,1), then body moves to previous positions: segment 1 to (3,2), segment 2 to (3,3), segment 3 to (3,4), but tail was at (4,4), which moves to where segment 2 was, but segment 2 was at (3,3), no.\n> \n> Previous positions: indices: 0:(3,2) head, 1:(3,3), 2:(3,4), 3:(4,4) tail.\n> \n> After move down to (3,1):\n> \n> - New head: (3,1)\n> \n> - Segment 1 moves to old head (3,2)\n> \n> - Segment 2 moves to old segment 1 (3,3)\n> \n> - Segment 3 (tail) moves to old segment 2 (3,4)\n> \n> So new positions: [(3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)]\n> \n> Tail is now at (3,4).\n> \n> Direction down.\n> \n> No food eaten.\n> \n> Option 3: Move right to (4,2). No food, similar to above, positions: head (4,2), then (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), tail at (3,4)? After move: head (4,2), segment 1 to (3,2), segment 2 to (3,3), segment 3 to (3,4), so [(4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)]\n> \n> Direction right.\n> \n> Now, back to option 1: if I eat at (2,2), I get +1, snake longer.\n> \n> But I need to think about the food at (2,1) and (1,1), which are close.\n> \n> Also, life span: (2,2) has life span 4, so if I don't eat it now, it might disappear soon, but I can eat it now.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,1) has life span 6, so I have more time.\n> \n> (1,1) has life span 9, plenty of time.\n> \n> But I should plan multiple turns.\n> \n> Since I need to think 5+ turns ahead, let's simulate possible sequences.\n> \n> First, immediate action on turn 11.\n> \n> If I move left to (2,2), eat food.\n> \n> Then turn 11: action L to (2,2)\n> \n> Now turn 12: head at (2,2), direction L (since I moved left).\n> \n> Possible moves: from (2,2), I can move U, D, L, R.\n> \n> But no instant reverse: current direction L, so cannot move R (right), because reverse of left is right.\n> \n> So possible: U (to (2,3)), D (to (2,1)), L (to (1,2))\n> \n> Now, (2,1) has food!

Let's see: borders are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the playable area should be x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6. But there's also an internal obstacle at (1,6). So cells occupied by walls are all (x,y) where x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7, and also (1,6).\n> \n> - Snake positions: Head at (2,2), then (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4). So the snake has 5 segments. Head direction is L, which means left, so it was moving left to (2,2) from previous position? Positions are given in order: head first, so from (2,2) to (3,2) to (3,3) to (3,4) to (4,4). Since head direction is L, it was moving left to (2,2), so previous position must have been (3,2) or something, but let's not worry about that.

Life span decreases every turn, including current turn. So at turn 12, for (2,1), life span 5 means it will disappear after 5 more turns? Life span is the number of turns it remains, including the current turn, so it disappears after N turns from now.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So for food at (2,1), life span 5 at turn 12: it will be there for turns 12,13,14,15,16, and disappear after turn 16? Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Disappears after N turns\" – I think it means after N turns from now, it vanishes. For example, if N=5 at turn t, it exists on turns t, t+1, t+2, t+3, t+4, and disappears at the start of turn t+5 or something. But the countdown decreases every turn, including current, so at turn t, countdown is N, at turn t+1, it's N-1, and so on, until countdown=0, then it disappears.\n> \n> The rule: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" so at turn t, countdown is life_span, then at turn t+1, it's life_span -1, etc. When countdown reaches 0, it disappears, I assume before the turn starts or after? But for eating, as long as it's present during the turn, it can be eaten.\n> \n> Typically, at the beginning of turn, food is present if countdown >0, and after the snake moves, if head eats it, then it's consumed.\n> \n> But for planning, I need to know when it disappears.\n> \n> Similarly for (1,1), life span 8 at turn 12.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (2,2), direction L, so moving left. Possible moves: since direction is L, I can move L (continue left), U (up), D (down), but not R (right) because that would be instant reverse, which is not allowed.\n> \n> Rule: \"No instant reverse\": Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn. So current direction is L, so I cannot move R on this turn.\n> \n> So possible actions at turn 12: L, U, D. R is invalid.\n> \n> Now, let's map the grid to visualize.\n> \n> Grid size: walls at x=0,7 and y=0,7, so playable area x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6. But internal obstacle at (1,6), so (1,6) is blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions: head (2,2), body (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), tail (4,4).

Typically in grids, y=0 might be top or bottom, but in snake, it's common to have y increasing downwards or upwards? The movement: U is (x,y+1), which might imply y increasing upwards or downwards?\n> \n> Let's see: U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), so if y increases upwards, U would increase y, meaning up, D decrease y, down. But in many systems, y increases downwards.\n> \n> In the state, walls include y=0 and y=7, but we need to know the orientation.\n> \n> From the movement definitions:\n> \n> U: (x,y+1) — if y+1, it could be up or down depending on coordinate system.\n> \n> But in the context, since walls are given, and positions, let's plot.\n> \n> Assume (0,0) is bottom-left, y increasing upwards, or top-left, y increasing downwards? I think it's ambiguous, but for collision, it doesn't matter, as long as we know adjacent cells.\n> \n> For example, from (2,2), moving U: (2,3), D: (2,1), L: (1,2), R: (3,2).\n> \n> Now, food is at (2,1) and (1,1), so (2,1) is one cell down from (2,2) if y increases upwards, or one cell up if y increases downwards. But again, for adjacency, it's clear: (2,1) is adjacent to (2,2) vertically.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,1) is adjacent to (1,2) and (2,1), etc.\n> \n> To avoid confusion, I'll define the grid: let's say the bottom-left is (1,1), top-right is (6,6), but walls are x=0,7 y=0,7, so playable cells: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n> \n> And let's assume y increases as we go up, so U: y+1 (up), D: y-1 (down), L: x-1 (left), R: x+1 (right).\n> \n> That makes sense with the walls: y=0 is bottom wall, y=7 top wall, etc.\n> \n> In the food, (2,1) is at y=1, which is bottom row, x=2.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,1) is bottom-left corner, but x=1,y=1.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (1,6), which is top-left, y=6.\n> \n> Now snake: head at (2,2), which is above (2,1).\n> \n> Body: (3,2) is right of head, same y, then (3,3) up from there, then (3,4) up, then tail (4,4) right and same y or what? (3,4) to (4,4) is right, x+1.\n> \n> So snake path: from head (2,2) left to? Previous move was to (2,2) from where? Since direction is L, it came from right, so from (3,2) to (2,2), moving left.\n> \n> Then body segments: (3,2) which is where it was, then (3,3), which is above (3,2), so it must have turned up at some point, then (3,4) up, then to (4,4) right.\n> \n> So the snake is like: head at (2,2), then to (3,2) — wait no, positions: [(2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4)] so the body after head is (3,2), so when head moves, the body follows.\n> \n> Currently, cells occupied: (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4).\n> \n> Food at (2,1) and (1,1).\n> \n> (2,1) is directly below (2,2), so if I move D to (2,1), I can eat it, since it's positive food.\n> \n> But I need to think about risks and plan ahead.\n> \n> First, possible moves at turn 12:\n> \n> - L: to (1,2)\n> \n> - U: to (2,3)\n> \n> - D: to (2,1)\n> \n> - R: not allowed, since opposite to current direction L.\n> \n> So choices: L, U, D.\n> \n> Now, if I move D to (2,1), I eat the food. Value +1, length increases to 6. After eating, the tail doesn't move immediately? When you eat, the snake grows, so after moving to (2,1), head is there, and since food is eaten, the tail doesn't move this turn, so the new segment is added at head, but positions: after move, head to (2,1), then body segments: previous head (2,2) becomes body, then (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), and tail (4,4) stays, but since food eaten, tail doesn't move, so positions become: [(2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4)]? No.\n> \n> Standard snake mechanics: when you move, head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment. If no food eaten, tail position is vacated. If food eaten, tail doesn't move, so a new segment is added at the tail position, but effectively, the snake grows by one.\n> \n> More precisely: after moving head to new cell, if food is there, it is eaten, and the body moves such that the last segment (tail) does not advance, so the snake gains a segment. If no food, tail moves forward, so snake length same.\n> \n> In this case, if I move to (2,1) and eat food, then new positions: head at (2,1), then previous head (2,2) is now first body, then (3,2) second body, then (3,3) third, (3,4) fourth, and (4,4) is still tail, but since food eaten, tail stays, so the segment that was tail is now part of body, and new tail is... positions: the snake had 5 segments, after eating, it has 6, so the positions are [new head, previous head, previous body1, body2, body3, previous tail] since tail didn't move.\n> \n> Initial positions: indices: 0:head (2,2), 1: (3,2), 2: (3,3), 3: (3,4), 4:tail (4,4)\n> \n> After move D to (2,1) and eat food:\n> \n> New head: (2,1)\n> \n> Then body: segment 0 becomes body at (2,2)\n> \n> Segment 1 moves to where segment 0 was, which is (2,2), but (2,2) is now occupied by the new body, so segment 1 goes to (2,2)? No.\n> \n> When head moves, all body segments shift to the position of the previous segment in the list.\n> \n> So after head moves to new position, the first body segment (index 1) moves to where head was ( (2,2) ), the second body segment (index 2) moves to where index 1 was ( (3,2) ), index 3 moves to where index 2 was ( (3,3) ), and index 4 (tail) moves to where index 3 was ( (3,4) ), but only if no food eaten. If food eaten, the tail does not move, so index 4 stays at (4,4), and a new segment is added at the tail position? No, the snake grows, so the tail remains, meaning the position that was tail is not vacated.\n> \n> Standard: if food eaten during move, the tail position is not removed, so the snake length increases by one, with the new segment at the head position after move? I think I have it.\n> \n> Perhaps it's better to think: after the head moves to a new cell, if that cell has food, the food is consumed, and the body moves, but the tail does not move, so the last segment stays, increasing length. If no food, tail moves, so length same.\n> \n> In terms of positions: for move, new head position, then the body positions are the previous positions from head to tail-1, and if food eaten, tail position remains, else it is removed.\n> \n> In list: positions [p0, p1, p2, ..., pk] with p0 head, pk tail.\n> \n> After move to new position p_new:\n> \n> - If no food, new positions: [p_new, p0, p1, p2, ..., pk-1]  (tail pk is removed)\n> \n> - If food, new positions: [p_new, p0, p1, p2, ..., pk]  (tail pk stays, so length increased)\n> \n> In this case, if I move to (2,1) and eat, new positions: [ (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4) ]  length 6.\n> \n> If no eat, say move to (1,2), no food there, new positions: [ (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4) ] and (4,4) vacated, length 5.\n> \n> Back to turn 12.\n> \n> I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> First, evaluate immediate options.\n> \n> Option 1: Move D to (2,1) at turn 12.\n> \n> - Eat positive food, score +1, length to 6.\n> \n> - New positions: head (2,1), body (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), tail (4,4)\n> \n> - Head at (2,1), which is on the bottom row, y=1.\n> \n> - Possible moves from there: U to (2,2), but (2,2) is now occupied by body, so if I move U to (2,2), head collides with body, death.\n> \n> L to (1,1), which has food, but need to check.\n> \n> R to (3,1), but (3,1) might be free?

So head moving to (2,2) while (2,2) is still a body part would cause collision, because the segment is there until the snake moves. When the head moves, the body shifts, so if head moves to (2,2), which is currently occupied by the neck, after movement, the neck would be at (1,2) or something? I need to simulate.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, the segment that was head is now neck, and so on, tail is removed unless food eaten.\n> \n> So, before move: positions: H(1,2), N(2,2), B(3,2), B(3,3), T(3,4)\n> \n> If I move right to (2,2): new head at (2,2), but (2,2) was occupied by N, so now head is on (2,2), which was N, and N moves to where? After move, the new position: head at (2,2), then the first body segment is at (1,2) (which was H), then (2,2) was N, but now head is there, so the body segments shift: after head moves to (2,2), the segment that was at (2,2) needs to move, but it's now the head position. Collision occurs if the new head position is the same as any body segment that will not be the tail moving away.\n> \n> Specifically, if the new head cell is occupied by a body segment that is not the tail, it's a collision because that segment is still there.\n> \n> In this case, (2,2) is occupied by the neck, which is not the tail, so moving to (2,2) would cause head to collide with body segment, death.\n> \n> Similarly, moving to any cell occupied by body except tail is deadly.\n> \n> Tail is at (3,4), which is not adjacent, so not an option here.\n> \n> So from (1,2), possible moves:\n> \n> - Up to (1,3)\n> \n> - Down to (1,1)\n> \n> - Left to (0,2): wall, invalid\n> \n> - Right to (2,2): body collision, invalid\n> \n> So only U or D are possible.\n> \n> Now, (1,3): what is there?

When you eat food, the tail doesn't move, so new positions: head at (1,1), then the previous head (1,2) becomes first body, so segments: H(1,1), B(1,2), B(2,2), B(3,2), B(3,3), T(3,4) — length 6 now.\n> \n> Tail is still at (3,4).\n> \n> Now from (1,1), possible moves: U to (1,2), but (1,2) is now a body segment, B(1,2), so moving to it would be collision, since it's not the tail.\n> \n> D: to (1,0), but y=0 wall, death.\n> \n> L: to (0,1), x=0 wall, death.\n> \n> R: to (2,1), which is food position (2,1), so I could go there.\n> \n> (2,1) is food, and it's empty except for food, so moving to (2,1) is possible.\n> \n> So from (1,1), only possible move is R to (2,1), since U, D, L are all blocked or body.\n> \n> U to (1,2) is body, D to wall, L to wall, so only R to (2,1).\n> \n> Then, if I go to (2,1), I eat that food too, since (2,1) has food, value 1.\n> \n> Then snake grows to length 7.\n> \n> New positions: head at (2,1), then B(1,1), B(1,2), B(2,2), B(3,2), B(3,3), T(3,4) — tail at (3,4).\n> \n> Now from (2,1), possible moves: U to (2,2), but (2,2) is body segment?

It's turn 14, and I'm playing Snake on a grid. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and an internal obstacle at (1,6). So the grid is from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls block those cells.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (1,1), then (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4). So the snake has 6 segments. Head direction is down, meaning it was moving down to (1,1) from (1,2)? Let's see: positions are listed as head first, so from head to tail: (1,1) is head, then (1,2) is next, which is below it? No, y-coordinates: if y increases up or down? The movement says U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), so I need to know the coordinate system.\n> \n> Typically in grids, (0,0) is bottom-left or top-left? The walls are given with y=0 and y=7 as borders, and U is (x,y+1), which might mean y increases upwards or downwards? U is up, so (x,y+1) should be increasing y when moving up. But in standard screen coordinates, y often increases downwards, but here the movement definitions suggest that U (up) increases y, so y must be increasing upwards. Let me confirm.\n> \n> Movement: U (x,y+1) — so if you move up, y increases. That means y=0 is the bottom row, y=7 is the top row? But walls: y=0 and y=7 are borders. Similarly, x=0 left, x=7 right.\n> \n> In the snake positions: head at (1,1), and previous head was at (1,2) since it's the second position.

Before moving down, the head was at (1,2), and it moved down to (1,1). Let's see the sequence:\n> \n> - Turn 13: head was at (1,2), direction to (1,1) is down? From (1,2) to (1,1): y decreased, so that's down. Then before that, it was at (1,2), which came from?

No.\n> \n> \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So at turn t, with life span N, the food will be present for N turns: turns t, t+1, ..., t+N-1, and disappears at turn t+N.\n> \n> For example, at turn t, life span N, after turn t, countdown becomes N-1, and so on, until countdown 0, then disappears.

I need to be precise.\n> \n> \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" — so on the turn it spawns, countdown is N, after that turn, it becomes N-1, and when countdown reaches 0, it disappears, so it is present for turns when countdown >=1.\n> \n> At turn t with life span L, food is present from turn t to turn t + L - 1, and disappears at turn t + L.\n> \n> For food at (2,1): turn 14, life span 3, so it will be there on turns 14, 15, 16, and disappear at turn 17.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,1) life span 9, present from turn 14 to 22, disappear at turn 23.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan actions for multiple turns ahead, at least 5 turns.\n> \n> Current head position: (1,1), direction D (down).\n> \n> Available moves: I can move U, D, L, R, but with constraints.\n> \n> No instant reverse: since current direction is D, I cannot move U (up) next, because that would be opposite direction.\n> \n> Possible moves from (1,1):\n> \n> - Down (D): to (1,0) — but y=0 is wall, so not possible.\n> \n> y=0 is border wall, so (1,0) is invalid.\n> \n> - Up (U): to (1,2) — but (1,2) is occupied by the snake body (first segment).\n> \n> Collision with body: head touches any body segment is deadly. But there's an exception: if it's the tail, and tail moves, it might be ok, but only if I'm moving into the tail cell and the tail will move away.\n> \n> Rule: \"But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> In this case, (1,2) is not the tail; it's the first body segment. Tail is at (3,4).\n> \n> So moving to (1,2) would collide with body segment, death.\n> \n> - Left (L): to (0,1) — but x=0 is wall, so invalid.\n> \n> - Right (R): to (2,1) — (2,1) has food, and it's not a wall or body? Body positions: (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4). So (2,1) is not occupied by body or wall. Walls are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and internal (1,6). So (2,1) is free.\n> \n> But (2,1) has food, positive food.\n> \n> Now, can I eat it? Moving to (2,1) would eat the food, since head moves onto food cell.\n> \n> But is there any danger? \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> Currently, tail is at (3,4). Head is at (1,1), which is not adjacent to (3,4). Adjacent means neighboring cells: up, down, left, right.\n> \n> Distance: from (1,1) to (3,4) is |dx|=2, |dy|=3, not adjacent. Adjacent would be same row or column with |dx|=1 or |dy|=1.\n> \n> So head is not adjacent to tail, so eating food at (2,1) should be fine.\n> \n> Moreover, after eating, snake grows, so new tail is added, so positions become: head at (2,1), then (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4) — tail was (3,4), but since we eat, we add a segment, so tail becomes (3,4) and new segment? When we eat, the length increases, so after moving to food, head is at food, and tail doesn't move? Standard snake: when you eat, you grow, so on the move you eat, you move head to food, the body follows, but since you eat, tail stays or something.\n> \n> Rule: \"Length of snake +1\" when eating positive food.\n> \n> So when head moves to food cell, it consumes the food, and the snake grows by one segment. That means that after moving, the tail does not move; it stays, so the new position has head at food, and all body segments shift, but tail remains, so length increases.\n> \n> For example, from current positions: head to (2,1), food eaten, so new head at (2,1), then the previous head (1,1) becomes first body, then (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4) remains as tail? But (3,4) was tail, now it's still there, and we add no new segment? I think I'm confusing.\n> \n> Standard snake mechanics: when no eat, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to previous position, tail leaves its cell.\n> \n> When eat, head moves to food, body segments follow, but tail does not move, so the cell where tail was remains occupied, and a new segment is added there? No.\n> \n> Typically: the snake moves one step: head to new position, each segment to the previous position of the one ahead. If no eat, tail position is vacated. If eat, tail does not vacate, so the snake grows by one cell at the tail end.\n> \n> So in this case, if I move to (2,1) and eat, the new positions should be: head at (2,1), then the old head (1,1) is now first body, then old first body (1,2) is now second body, and so on, up to old tail (3,4) remains tail, but since we ate, the tail doesn't move, so it stays, and length increases.\n> \n> After move without eat: positions would be head to new, then body to old head, etc., tail to previous tail position? Let's list.\n> \n> Current positions: index 0: head (1,1), 1: seg1 (1,2), 2: seg2 (2,2), 3: seg3 (3,2), 4: seg4 (3,3), 5: tail (3,4)\n> \n> If I move head to new position, say (2,1), without eating, then new head (2,1), seg1 to old head (1,1), seg2 to old seg1 (1,2), seg3 to old seg2 (2,2), seg4 to old seg3 (3,2), tail to old seg4 (3,3), and (3,4) vacated.\n> \n> But if I eat at (2,1), then head to (2,1), seg1 to (1,1), seg2 to (1,2), seg3 to (2,2), seg4 to (3,2), tail to (3,3), and since we ate, we add a new segment at the tail, so tail is now at (3,3), but we add a new tail segment? No: the tail moves to (3,3), but because we ate, we don't remove the last segment, so the segment that was at (3,4) remains? I think it's better to think that after moving with eat, the snake has one more segment, so the tail position from before is still occupied.\n> \n> From rule: \"Length of snake +1\" when eating.\n> \n> So after moving to food: head at food, each body segment moves to the previous position, and the tail stays where it was, meaning that the last position is not vacated, and we have an additional segment.\n> \n> In terms of positions: after move with eat, the new positions are: head at new cell, then all previous positions from head to tail are now body segments, including the old tail, and a new segment is added at the old tail position? No.\n> \n> Example: suppose snake is [H, B1, T] with H at A, B1 at B, T at C.\n> \n> Move to new cell D without food: new [H at D, B1 at A, T at B], C vacated.\n> \n> Move to D with food: new [H at D, B1 at A, T at C], and since ate, length increases, so T is still at C, no vacate, and now B1 is at A, so positions are [D, A, C] — but C was T, now it's still there, so we have head at D, then A, then C, with no segment at B? That can't be.\n> \n> I think I have it wrong.\n> \n> Standard way: when snake eats, it moves head to new cell (with food), the body follows as usual, but the tail does not move, so the cell that would have been vacated is not, and the snake grows by one cell at the tail end. So the tail remains in place for that turn.\n> \n> After the move, the tail is still at its old position, and the new segment is added there.\n> \n> In the position list, after eating, the tail position is the same as before, and the body extends.\n> \n> For this case:\n> \n> Current: H(1,1), B1(1,2), B2(2,2), B3(3,2), B4(3,3), T(3,4)\n> \n> Move head to (2,1) with eat: head now at (2,1), B1 moves to old H position (1,1), B2 moves to old B1 position (1,2), B3 moves to old B2 position (2,2), B4 moves to old B3 position (3,2), T moves to old B4 position (3,3). But since we ate, T does not move? No, all segments move except that the tail doesn't leave, so T moves to (3,3), and since we ate, we don't remove the cell, so (3,4) is still occupied? But (3,4) was T, now T is at (3,3), so (3,4) should be vacated unless we add a segment.\n> \n> I think I found a better way: in the move, when you eat, the tail does not advance; it stays, so the snake grows.\n> \n> So for move with eat: head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to previous position, but the tail does not move, so the last position remains occupied, and the snake has a new segment at the tail end, so length increases.\n> \n> So positions: new head at (2,1), B1 at old head (1,1), B2 at old B1 (1,2), B3 at old B2 (2,2), B4 at old B3 (3,2), and T stays at (3,4)? But then the segment that was B4 is moving to (3,2), but T is still at (3,4), so we have an extra segment.\n> \n> Positions become: head (2,1), then B1 (1,1), B2 (1,2), B3 (2,2), B4 (3,2), and T (3,4) — but B4 was at (3,3) before, now at (3,2), and T at (3,4) same as before. But the body is not connected; from (3,2) to (3,4) is not adjacent, missing a segment.\n> \n> I think I have a confusion.\n> \n> Perhaps it's that the body segments all shift, and when you eat, you add a new segment at the position where the tail was, so the tail doesn't move, but a new segment is added behind it.\n> \n> But in terms of the list, after move with eat, the positions are: new head position, then the previous head position, then the previous body positions in order, and the previous tail position is still included, but since tail didn't move, it's the same cell.\n> \n> Let's read the rule: \"Length of snake +1\" when eating positive food.\n> \n> Also, from the state, when food is eaten, it's consumed.\n> \n> For simulation, when the head moves to a food cell, the food is eaten, and the snake grows, so the tail does not move on that turn, meaning that the cell the tail was in remains occupied, and the new tail is there, but since it didn't move, the positions are: head new, then the previous positions of head and all body segments except the tail is removed? I'm messing up.\n> \n> I found a better way: in the position list, when the snake moves without eating, the new position list is [new_head, old_head, old_body1, ..., old_body_{n-2}, old_tail? No.\n> \n> Standard: positions are a list from head to tail.\n> \n> When moving to a new cell without food: new_head = new position, then the rest of the list is the old list without the last element (tail), so the new list is [new_head] + old_list[:-1] , so the tail position is removed.\n> \n> With food: new_head = new position, then the new list is [new_head] + old_list, so the old tail is still there, and we have all old positions plus new head, so length increases by one.\n> \n> For example, current list: [ (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4) ]\n> \n> Move to (2,1) with food: new head (2,1), then add old list: so new positions: [ (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4) ] — so the tail is still (3,4), but now it's the last, and we have an additional segment at (3,3) which was the fourth segment, now it's body, and tail at (3,4).\n> \n> Old list had 6 positions, new list has 7 positions.\n> \n> The cell (3,4) was tail, now it's still occupied, and (3,3) is also occupied, which was previously occupied by B4, now it's part of body.\n> \n> And the head is at (2,1).\n> \n> Similarly, if no food, move to (2,1): new head (2,1), then old head and body except tail: so [ (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3) ] — tail was at (3,4), now removed, so positions from (3,2) to (3,3), and (3,4) vacated.\n> \n> Yes, that makes sense.\n> \n> Back to the move.\n> \n> From (1,1), moving right to (2,1) is possible, and it has food, so I can eat it.\n> \n> But are there any risks?

Subsequent turns (15-16) are forced right due to body and wall constraints, leading to (4,1) by turn 16. At turn 17, moving right to eat the second positive food at (5,1) maximizes score with no tail collision risk, and avoids the food expiring later. Turns 18-19 move up to access open areas for long-term survival, as no food remains and the snake must avoid the bottom-left body cluster.\n",

And since growth, we add a new segment where the tail was, but tail was at (3,2), and since no move, the tail stays, so the new tail is added at (3,2)? Standard snake growth: when head eats food, the tail remains in place, so a new segment is added at the position of the current tail before the move.\n> \n> Before move: snake is [(4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2)] with tail at (3,2).\n> \n> Head moves to (5,1).

No.\n> \n> When head moves to a food cell, it eats the food, and the snake grows by one segment. This means that during this move, the tail does not move, so the new segment is effectively added at the tail position, but since tail doesn't move, the snake gains a segment.\n> \n> After move: head at new position, then the entire previous snake body, including the tail, becomes the new body, so length increases by one.\n> \n> In this case: before move to (5,1), snake was at positions: head (4,1), body segments (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), tail (3,2).\n> \n> After head moves to (5,1) and eats food, the new snake is: head (5,1), followed by (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), and (3,2) — but (3,2) is still the tail, and since we add a segment, the tail is now (3,2), and we have an additional segment? I think I'm confusing.\n> \n> Standard: the snake body is a list of positions. When head moves to a new cell without food, the head goes to new position, and the tail is removed.

It's turn 16, and I'm playing Snake on a grid that seems to be 7x7, since the borders are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. There's also an internal obstacle at (1,6).\n> \n> The snake positions are: head at (3,1), then body segments at (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3). So the snake is 7 segments long. The head direction is R, meaning it's moving right, so it came from the left.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - Food at (5,1) with value 1 and life span 7. Since current turn is 16, it will disappear after turn 16 + 7 = 23, but life span decreases every turn including current, so it has 7 turns left including this one? Let me read the life-span rule: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So if life_span is 7 at turn 16, it means after 7 more turns, it will disappear. So it can be eaten from turn 16 to turn 22, and disappears at turn 23? But since we eat on the turn we move to it, it should be available until turn 22.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (5,2) with value 1 and life span 10, so it has 10 turns left.\n> \n> Both foods have value +1, so positive food.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n> \n> First, let's sketch the grid. Assume grid from x=0 to x=7, y=0 to y=7. But borders are walls, so cells like (0,y), (7,y), (x,0), (x,7) are walls. Also, internal obstacle at (1,6).\n> \n> Snake positions:\n> \n> - Head: (3,1)\n> \n> - Body: (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3)\n> \n> So let's list all occupied cells:\n> \n> - (3,1): head\n> \n> - (2,1)\n> \n> - (1,1)\n> \n> - (1,2)\n> \n> - (2,2)\n> \n> - (3,2)\n> \n> - (3,3)\n> \n> So the snake is shaped like: from (3,1) right to (2,1)? Head is at (3,1), moving right, so previous position was left, which is (2,1), then (1,1), then it turned down to (1,2), then right to (2,2), then down to (3,2)? Positions are given in order: head first, then body segments.\n> \n> So: (3,1) -> (2,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (2,2) -> (3,2) -> (3,3)\n> \n> So from (3,1) to (2,1) is left, but head direction is R, which is right. Contradiction?\n> \n> Head direction is given as R, meaning it's currently moving right. But from the positions, at (3,1), if it's moving right, the next position should be to the right, like (4,1), but it's not, the body is behind it.\n> \n> The positions are the current positions; the direction is the direction it was moving to get to the head position. So at turn 16, the head is at (3,1), and it arrived there by moving right, so from (2,1) to (3,1). Yes.\n> \n> So at turn 16, head is at (3,1), and it moved right to get there, so the previous head position was (2,1) at turn 15.\n> \n> Body segments follow: after head is (2,1), which was the head at turn 15, then (1,1) which was turn 14, then (1,2) which was turn 13, and so on.\n> \n> But for movement, I need to decide where to go next.\n> \n> Possible moves from current head (3,1): since head direction is R, I can move U, D, or R, but not L because that would be instant reverse. Current direction is R, so I cannot move L (left) on the next turn.\n> \n> Allowed moves: U (up, to (3,2)? (3,2) is currently occupied by the body.\n> \n> Let's list possible adjacent cells from (3,1):\n> \n> - Right: (4,1)\n> \n> - Up: (3,2) but (3,2) is occupied by a body segment, so moving there would cause collision unless it's the tail that moves away.\n> \n> - Down: (3,0) but y=0 is a wall, so (3,0) is out of bounds or wall? Borders: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7 are walls, so (3,0) is a wall cell, cannot move there.\n> \n> - Left: (2,1) but (2,1) is occupied by body, and also, instant reverse is not allowed since current direction is R, moving left would be opposite.\n> \n> Instant reverse: cannot move opposite to current direction. Current direction is R, so moving L is not allowed.\n> \n> So possible moves:\n> \n> - U: to (3,2)\n> \n> - R: to (4,1)\n> \n> - D: to (3,0) but that's wall, invalid.\n> \n> - L: not allowed, and also occupied.\n> \n> So only U and R are possible? U to (3,2) and R to (4,1).\n> \n> Now, (3,2) is occupied by a body segment, which is not the tail. The tail is at (3,3). (3,2) is the second last segment or something.\n> \n> Snake positions: indices: 0: head (3,1), 1: (2,1), 2: (1,1), 3: (1,2), 4: (2,2), 5: (3,2), 6: tail (3,3)\n> \n> So (3,2) is position 5, which is not the tail; tail is (3,3).\n> \n> If I move to (3,2), which is occupied by the body, that would be a collision because the body segment there doesn't move away immediately; only the tail moves when we eat, but here we're not eating, just moving.\n> \n> General rule: when moving, if the head moves to a cell occupied by a body segment, it dies, unless that body segment is the tail and it moves away at the same time.\n> \n> Specifically: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, if I move to a cell that is the tail, and I don't eat food, the tail moves, so it's safe. But if I move to a non-tail body segment, it's collision.\n> \n> In this case, (3,2) is position 5, which is not the tail; tail is (3,3). So moving to (3,2) would cause collision.\n> \n> Therefore, from (3,1), moving U to (3,2) is invalid because it's occupied by a non-tail body segment.\n> \n> Moving D to (3,0) is wall, invalid.\n> \n> Moving L to (2,1) is invalid because instant reverse not allowed, and also occupied.\n> \n> Moving R to (4,1) seems possible, as (4,1) might be empty or food.\n> \n> Is (4,1) occupied? From snake positions, no: snake has (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3). So (4,1) is not listed, so it should be empty, or could be food.\n> \n> Food is at (5,1) and (5,2), so (4,1) is empty.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,2) is occupied, so not empty.\n> \n> So only possible move is R to (4,1)? But what about other directions?\n> \n> Up: (3,2) is occupied, so not possible.\n> \n> Left: not allowed.\n> \n> Down: wall.\n> \n> So only right to (4,1) is possible?\n> \n> But let's confirm the grid.\n> \n> Grid size: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so cells from x=1 to x=6, y=1 to y=6? No.\n> \n> x=0 and x=7 are walls, so the playable area is x=1 to x=6, y=1 to y=6? But y=0 and y=7 are also walls, so yes, grid from (1,1) to (6,6) I think, since x=0,7 and y=0,7 are walls.\n> \n> For example, (3,0): y=0, so wall.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,7) would be wall.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (1,6), which is within playable area.\n> \n> Playable cells: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except walls.\n> \n> (1,6) is internal obstacle, so not accessible.\n> \n> So from (3,1), adjacent cells:\n> \n> - North: (3,2) - but occupied by snake body at (3,2)\n> \n> - South: (3,0) - y=0, wall\n> \n> - West: (2,1) - occupied and instant reverse not allowed\n> \n> - East: (4,1) - should be empty, since not in snake positions or walls.\n> \n> Food is at (5,1) and (5,2), not (4,1).\n> \n> So only possible move is East to (4,1).\n> \n> But is there no other option? What about moving to other cells? From (3,1), only four directions.\n> \n> Perhaps I can consider that if I move up, but (3,2) is occupied, so no.\n> \n> Unless the body moves away, but in this case, when I move, the head moves first, then the body follows, so if I move to (3,2), which is currently occupied, but when I move, the head goes to (3,2), and the body segment that was there moves to the next position, but since it's not the tail, it might still be colliding.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when the head moves to a new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment. So if head moves to (3,2), which was occupied by segment 5, then segment 5 moves to where segment 4 was, which is (2,2), and so on, down to the tail.\n> \n> But at the moment of movement, if the head moves to a cell that is occupied by a body segment, it collides, because that segment hasn't moved yet.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, for non-tail segments, it's always a collision if head moves there.\n> \n> In this case, (3,2) is occupied by segment 5, which is not the tail, so moving there would cause collision.\n> \n> Therefore, from (3,1), the only safe move is to (4,1).\n> \n> Then, after moving to (4,1), the snake will be: head at (4,1), then the body: the previous head (3,1) becomes the first body segment, so positions: [(4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2)] and tail (3,3) moves to where (3,2) was? Let's think.\n> \n> After moving head to (4,1), the new positions:\n> \n> - Head: (4,1)\n> \n> - Then the previous positions shifted: segment 1 was (2,1), but now it moves to where head was, (3,1)\n> \n> Generally, the body segments follow: the segment that was behind the head moves to the head's old position.\n> \n> So: new head: (4,1)\n> \n> Then body segments:\n> \n> - First body: old head position (3,1)\n> \n> - Second body: old first body position (2,1)\n> \n> - Third body: old second body (1,1)\n> \n> - Fourth body: old third body (1,2)\n> \n> - Fifth body: old fourth body (2,2)\n> \n> - Sixth body: old fifth body (3,2)\n> \n> - Tail: old sixth body (3,3)? No.\n> \n> Positions: indices 0 to 6.\n> \n> After move: head to new position, then body segment i moves to position of segment i-1 from before, for i from 1 to 6.\n> \n> Segment 0 (head) moves to (4,1)\n> \n> Segment 1 moves to where segment 0 was: (3,1)\n> \n> Segment 2 moves to where segment 1 was: (2,1)\n> \n> Segment 3 moves to where segment 2 was: (1,1)\n> \n> Segment 4 moves to where segment 3 was: (1,2)\n> \n> Segment 5 moves to where segment 4 was: (2,2)\n> \n> Segment 6 (tail) moves to where segment 5 was: (3,2)\n> \n> And the old tail position (3,3) is now empty, unless there was food, but no.\n> \n> So new snake positions: [(4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2)]\n> \n> Tail is at (3,2), which was previously occupied.\n> \n> Now, at this point, head is at (4,1), direction is R (since we moved right).\n> \n> Now, I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n> \n> Food: (5,1) with value 1, life span 7, so at turn 16, it has 7 turns left, meaning it disappears after turn 22? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 16, life span 7, after turn 16, it becomes 6, and so on, until 0, then disappears. So it can be eaten as long as life span >0, I think. When life span reaches 0, it disappears before the turn or after?\n> \n> \"Disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so if at turn T, life span L, it decreases to L-1 at turn T+1, and when it reaches 0, it disappears.\n> \n> For example, at turn 16, life span 7, so:\n> \n> After turn 16: life span 6 (still present)\n> \n> After turn 17: 5, etc.\n> \n> After turn 22: life span 1\n> \n> After turn 23: life span 0, disappears, so not present at turn 23.\n> \n> So it can be eaten from turn 16 to turn 22 inclusive.\n> \n> Similarly for (5,2), life span 10 at turn 16, so disappears after turn 25 (since 16+10=26, but after turn 25: life span 0? Let's calculate:\n> \n> Turn 16: life span 10\n> \n> After turn 16: dec to 9\n> \n> ...\n> \n> After turn 25: dec to 0, disappear at turn 26.\n> \n> But eaten on the turn we move to it.\n> \n> Now back to the game.\n> \n> At turn 16, I must move to (4,1), as that's the only choice.\n> \n> Then at turn 17, head at (4,1), direction R.\n> \n> From (4,1), possible moves:\n> \n> - U: to (4,2)\n> \n> - D: to (4,0) but y=0 wall, invalid\n> \n> - L: to (3,1) but (3,1) is now occupied by the first body segment?

It's turn 17, and I'm the snake. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and an internal obstacle at (1,6). So, the playable area is from x=1 to x=6 and y=1 to y=6, except for (1,6) which is blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (4,1), then body segments: (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2). So the snake is coiled up. Head direction is right (R), meaning it was moving to the right to reach (4,1) from previous position. Since head is at (4,1) and direction is R, it came from left, so previous head was at (3,1), but (3,1) is now the first body segment.\n> \n> Snake positions list: [(4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2)]. So head is (4,1), and tail is (3,2). The snake has 7 segments.\n> \n> Food available:\n> \n> - (5,1) with life_span 6, value +1 (positive food)\n> \n> - (5,2) with life_span 9, value +1 (also positive food)\n> \n> Both are positive foods, no negative food mentioned. Value is 1 for both, so +1 score and length increase if eaten.\n> \n> Life_span: for (5,1) it's 6, meaning it disappears after 6 turns including this one, so it will be gone by turn 17 + 6 - 1? Let's clarify life_span.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) | Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So for food at turn t with life_span L, it disappears at the end of turn t + L - 1? Let's think.\n> \n> \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" and \"disappears after N turns\". So if life_span is N at turn t, after one turn (turn t+1), life_span becomes N-1, and so on, until life_span 0, it disappears. So it can be eaten only when life_span >=1.\n> \n> At turn t, life_span L, it can be eaten on turn t, then life_span decreases to L-1 at turn t+1, and so on, until L=0, it disappears before the next turn.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" so at the start of turn, if life_span is L, during the turn it can be eaten, and at the end of the turn, life_span decreases by 1. When life_span reaches 0 after decrease, it disappears.\n> \n> For food at (5,1): life_span 6 at turn 17. So:\n> \n> - Turn 17: life_span 6, can be eaten\n> \n> - After turn 17, life_span becomes 5\n> \n> - Turn 18: life_span 5, can be eaten\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - Turn 22: life_span 1, can be eaten\n> \n> - After turn 22, life_span decreases to 0 and disappears, so not available on turn 23.\n> \n> Similarly for (5,2): life_span 9 at turn 17, so it will be around until after turn 17+8=25? Let's calculate.\n> \n> At turn 17, life_span 9.\n> \n> After turn 17: life_span 8\n> \n> Turn 18: life_span 8, etc.\n> \n> After turn 25: life_span 9 - (25-17) = 9 - 8 =1? Turns from 17 to 25 inclusive is 9 turns? Better to think indices.\n> \n> Turn t: life_span L\n> \n> After k turns, at turn t+k, life_span is L - k\n> \n> It disappears when life_span <=0 after decrease.\n> \n> So for (5,1): L=6 at t=17\n> \n> At turn t=17 + k, life_span = 6 - k\n> \n> Available when 6 - k >=1, so k <=5\n> \n> k from 0 to 5, turns 17 to 22.\n> \n> At turn 23: life_span =6-6=0, not available.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,2): L=9 at t=17\n> \n> Available from turn 17 to turn 17+8=25? k from 0 to 8, turns 17 to 25.\n> \n> At turn 25: life_span=9-8=1, can be eaten.\n> \n> After turn 25, life_span=0, disappears.\n> \n> Now, snake head at (4,1), direction R. So possible moves: since direction is R, I can move U, D, R, but not L (because L is opposite, instant reverse not allowed).\n> \n> Current head direction is R, so I cannot move L on the next turn. Moves allowed: U, D, R.\n> \n> Now, grid size: walls at x=0,7 and y=0,7, so playable area x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, but internal obstacle at (1,6), so (1,6) is blocked.\n> \n> I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n> \n> First, let's list possible actions for turn 17.\n> \n> Head at (4,1), direction R.\n> \n> Possible moves:\n> \n> - U: to (4,2)\n> \n> - D: to (4,0), but y=0 is wall, so invalid. Walls are at y=0, so (4,0) is out of bounds, collision.\n> \n> - R: to (5,1)\n> \n> - L: to (3,1), but (3,1) is a body segment, and since direction is R, moving L is opposite, so not allowed anyway.\n> \n> So valid moves: U to (4,2) or R to (5,1).\n> \n> Now, (5,1) has food with value +1. If I move R to (5,1), I eat the food, score +1, length increases by 1.\n> \n> But I need to check for risks.\n> \n> First, after eating, the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move this turn? No, when you eat, the tail grows immediately, meaning that after moving to the food, the new segment is added, so the tail stays in place or something.\n> \n> Standard snake mechanics: when you eat food, you move the head to the food cell, and a new segment is added at the tail, so the tail doesn't move that turn. But in terms of positions, the head moves to the food, and the body follows, but since a new segment is added, the tail position remains the same for that turn? Let's clarify from the rules.\n> \n> The rules say: \"Length of snake +1\" when eating positive food.\n> \n> And for movement, the snake moves: head to new position, each body segment moves to the previous position of the next segment, and the tail moves away from its position.\n> \n> But when eating, the tail doesn't move, so a new segment is added where the tail was, so the snake grows.\n> \n> In terms of collision, after moving, if head collides with body, it dies.\n> \n> Also, special case: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> But in this case, the food is at (5,1), which is not under the snake body, I think. Let's see snake positions: [(4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2)]\n> \n> (5,1) is empty, so moving to (5,1) should be fine, no collision.\n> \n> But after eating, the snake grows, so the new length will be 8 segments.\n> \n> Now, the tail is at (3,2). After moving head to (5,1), the body moves: (4,1) becomes new neck, and so on, tail at (3,2) will stay or move? When head moves to new cell, each segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead.\n> \n> So positions after move without eating: head to (5,1), then (4,1) to where head was, but (4,1) is now body, so the segment that was at (3,1) moves to (4,1), (2,1) to (3,1), (1,1) to (2,1), (1,2) to (1,1)? Let's list current positions:\n> \n> Index: 0: head (4,1)\n> \n> 1: (3,1)\n> \n> 2: (2,1)\n> \n> 3: (1,1)\n> \n> 4: (1,2)\n> \n> 5: (2,2)\n> \n> 6: tail (3,2)\n> \n> After moving head to (5,1), without eating, the new positions would be:\n> \n> Head: (5,1)\n> \n> Body: segment 1 moves to previous head position (4,1)\n> \n> Segment 2 moves to previous segment 1 position (3,1)\n> \n> Segment 3 moves to previous segment 2 position (2,1)\n> \n> Segment 4 moves to previous segment 3 position (1,1)\n> \n> Segment 5 moves to previous segment 4 position (1,2)\n> \n> Segment 6 (tail) moves to previous segment 5 position (2,2)\n> \n> And the previous tail position (3,2) is now empty.\n> \n> But when eating food, since it's positive food, length increases, so a new segment is added. The new segment is added at the tail position before it moves, so the tail doesn't move, and a new segment is created at the old tail position.\n> \n> So with eating: head moves to (5,1), new head position.\n> \n> Then the body: segment 1 moves to (4,1) (previous head)\n> \n> Segment 2 moves to (3,1) (previous segment 1)\n> \n> Segment 3 moves to (2,1) (previous segment 2)\n> \n> Segment 4 moves to (1,1) (previous segment 3)\n> \n> Segment 5 moves to (1,2) (previous segment 4)\n> \n> Now, segment 6 (tail) does not move; instead, a new segment is added at (3,2) (previous tail position), so the tail is now at (3,2), and new segment at (3,2) is part of body, tail is still (3,2)? No.\n> \n> Positions after move with eating:\n> \n> - Head: (5,1)\n> \n> - Body: the segment that was index 1 is now at (4,1)\n> \n> - Index 2 at (3,1)\n> \n> - Index 3 at (2,1)\n> \n> - Index 4 at (1,1)\n> \n> - Index 5 at (1,2)\n> \n> - Index 6 (old tail) at (2,2)? Let's think carefully.\n> \n> When the head moves to a new cell and eats, the head occupies the food cell, and a new segment is added at the current tail position before any movement. Then the body moves as usual.\n> \n> So before movement: positions: H: (4,1), B1: (3,1), B2: (2,1), B3: (1,1), B4: (1,2), B5: (2,2), T: (3,2)\n> \n> After move: head moves to (5,1)\n> \n> Then, the new segment is added at T's position, so we have an extra segment.\n> \n> Then, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> So: B1 moves to where H was, (4,1)\n> \n> B2 moves to where B1 was, (3,1)\n> \n> B3 moves to where B2 was, (2,1)\n> \n> B4 moves to where B3 was, (1,1)\n> \n> B5 moves to where B4 was, (1,2)\n> \n> T moves to where B5 was, (2,2)\n> \n> And new segment at where T was, (3,2)\n> \n> So the new positions are: head (5,1), then segments: (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2) — and the new segment at (3,2), but (3,2) is already there?

    {
        "step": 18,

        "thinking": "Based on the detailed analysis provided by the Thinking Model, the immediate action for the current Turn \\( t_0 = 18 \\) is to move **Up (U)** to eat the positive food at (5, 2). This action maximizes the score by securing the +1 point immediately and avoids unnecessary risks. \n\nHere's the reasoning summarized:\n1. **Valid Moves**: From the current head position (5, 1) with direction **R**, the allowed moves are **U**, **D**, or **R** (no instant reverse to **L**). \n   - **D** to (5, 0) is invalid (wall collision at y = 0).\n   - **R** to (6, 1) is safe but does not yield immediate points.\n   - **U** to (5, 2) is safe, avoids collisions, and eats the positive food (+1 score, length +1).\n\n2. **Food Mechanics**: The food at (5, 2) has a lifespan of 8 turns (disappears after turn 25). Eating it now ensures the point is secured early, and the snake can then focus on survival. Delaying risks missing the food if the snake gets trapped or the food expires.\n\n3. **Collision Safety**: \n   - Moving **U** to (5, 2) does not collide with the body (current body segments do not include (5, 2)). \n   - No \"Tail Reward Danger\" (tail is at (3, 2), not adjacent to (5, 2)).\n\n4. **Long-Term Survival**: After eating, the Thinking Model suggests moving upward (e.g., (5, 3), (5, 4), etc.) to open space, avoiding the congested bottom-left area and walls.\n\n### Final Action:\n\\boxed{U}",
        "state": "**Current Turn**: \\( t_0 = 18 \\)\n**Cells occupied by walls**:\n\t - Border Cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7.\n\t - Internal Obstacles: [(1, 6)]\n**Snake Positions**:[(5, 1), (4, 1), (3, 1), (2, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2)]\n**Snake Head Direction**: R\n**Food Positions, Life Span and Value**:\n\t- (5, 2, 8, 1)\n> **Guidance from a Previous Thinking Model:** Turn \\( t_1 = 18 \\)\n> <think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 18. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and an internal obstacle at (1,6). So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), with (1,6) blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (5,1), then body segments: (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2). So the snake is 8 segments long. Head direction is right (R), meaning it's moving to the right.\n> \n> Food: only one food mentioned at (5,2) with life span 8 and value 1. Value 1 means it's positive food, so eating it would increase the snake's length by 1 and give +1 score. Life span 8 means it disappears after 8 turns, including the current turn. So from turn 18, it will last until turn 25 (since it decreases each turn, including turn 18).\n> \n> Now, I need to plan an action sequence for at least 5 turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks. I should think about survival first.\n> \n> Current head position: (5,1), moving right. From the positions, the head is at (5,1), and next would be to (6,1) if it moves right, but let's see the possible moves.\n> \n> Possible moves from (5,1): Up (U) to (5,2), Down (D) to (5,0), Left (L) to (4,1), Right (R) to (6,1).\n> \n> But head direction is R, so if I move left, that would be opposite direction, but the rule says \"no instant reverse\": cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn. Current direction is R, so I cannot move L (left) immediately because that would be opposite.\n> \n> So allowed moves: U, D, R. Not L.\n> \n> Now, check for collisions:\n> \n> - Walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So:\n> \n> - U to (5,2): y=2 is within 1 to 6? y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y from 1 to 6 are safe? y=0 is wall, y=7 is wall. Grid coordinates: since walls at y=0 and y=7, cells from y=1 to y=6 are free, but y=0 and y=7 are walls, so valid y: 1 to 6 inclusive? Let's clarify.\n> \n> Cells occupied by walls: border cells x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So any cell with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 is a wall. Similarly, internal obstacle at (1,6).\n> \n> So for movement, we cannot move to cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, or (1,6).\n> \n> Now, (5,2): x=5, y=2. x=5 is not 0 or 7, y=2 is not 0 or 7, and not (1,6), so safe from walls.\n> \n> (5,0): y=0, which is wall, so invalid.\n> \n> (4,1): x=4,y=1, not wall, but moving left to (4,1) is not allowed because it's opposite direction? No, (4,1) is the current position of the first body segment? Let's see.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (5,1), then (4,1), (3,1), etc. So (4,1) is occupied by the body.\n> \n> But for movement, when we move, the snake will advance, so the head moves to a new position, and the tail moves, so cells that are occupied now might not be occupied after move.\n> \n> Collision rules: body collision only if head touches a body segment after the move, but since the tail moves, the cell that was tail becomes free, except when eating food.\n> \n> Specifically: after moving, if head is on a cell with body segment, it dies. But the tail segment will move away if no food eaten, so only if head hits a segment that is not the tail or something.\n> \n> Standard snake: when moving, head goes to new cell, each segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, and if food eaten, a new segment is added at the tail.\n> \n> In terms of collision: head collides with any body segment except that the tail is safe because it moves, but only if we don't eat food.\n> \n> Rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, after moving, if the head is on a cell that is occupied by any body segment except the current tail position (because tail moves), it's ok only for the tail cell.\n> \n> But in this case, for turn t1, when we move, the snake will have new positions.\n> \n> Let's list current positions:\n> \n> Index 0: head (5,1)\n> \n> 1: (4,1)\n> \n> 2: (3,1)\n> \n> 3: (2,1)\n> \n> 4: (1,1)\n> \n> 5: (1,2)\n> \n> 6: (2,2)\n> \n> 7: (3,2)  // tail\n> \n> After one move, if no food eaten, head moves to new position, segment 1 moves to (5,1), segment 2 to (4,1), ..., segment 7 to (2,2)? Let's see the sequence.\n> \n> Positions: [ (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2) ]\n> \n> After move, if head moves to (6,1), for example, then new positions: head at (6,1), then body: (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2) and tail is (2,2)? No.\n> \n> The body segments follow: the new position 1 is old head (5,1), position 2 is old position 1 (4,1), position 3 is old position 2 (3,1), position 4 is old position 3 (2,1), position 5 is old position 4 (1,1), position 6 is old position 5 (1,2), position 7 is old position 6 (2,2), and old position 7 (3,2) is abandoned, so tail moves.\n> \n> Now, collision: if head moves to a cell that is currently occupied by a body segment, it might be a collision unless it's the tail and we don't eat food.\n> \n> Specifically, if head moves to a cell that is not the current tail position, and it's occupied, collision. If it moves to current tail position, it's ok only if no food eaten, because if food eaten, tail doesn't move, so head and tail would be on same cell or something.\n> \n> Rule: \"But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, moving to the tail cell is safe because the tail moves away, so after move, head is on that cell, tail is elsewhere, no collision.\n> \n> But if you move to a non-tail body cell, it's occupied and will still be there after move, so collision.\n> \n> Also, if you eat food, tail doesn't move, so if head moves to a cell that was not tail, but if it was tail and you eat food, it might be a problem? Rule has \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it kills snake because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> Let's read that.\n> \n> \"**Tail Reward Danger**: If the head is *adjacent to the tail* and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n> \n> In this case, the food is at (5,2), which is not the tail. Tail is at (3,2).\n> \n> First, for possible moves from (5,1):\n> \n> - U to (5,2): that's where the food is. So if I move up, I go to (5,2), which has food. Since it's positive food, I eat it, length increases by 1.\n> \n> Now, check if it's safe. (5,2) is not occupied by any body segment? Current positions: (5,1) head, (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2). (5,2) is not in this list, so it's free, no body there. So moving to (5,2) is safe from collision, and I eat food.\n> \n> But is there Tail Reward Danger? Head is at (5,1), tail at (3,2). Are they adjacent? Adjacent means sharing an edge, so (5,1) and (3,2): dx=2, dy=1, not adjacent; adjacent would be same x, y±1 or same y, x±1. So (5,1) and (5,2) are adjacent vertically, but (5,1) and (3,2) are not adjacent. Distance in x is 2, y is 1, so not adjacent cells. So no issue.\n> \n> Thus, moving U to (5,2) seems possible, and I get +1 score, length increases.\n> \n> But I need to think long-term. Also, life span of food is 8 turns, from turn 18, so it will disappear at turn 25 if not eaten. But I can eat it now.\n> \n> Other moves:\n> \n> - D to (5,0): but y=0 is wall, so invalid, cannot move there.\n> \n> - L to (4,1): but (4,1) is current position of body segment 1. After move, if I move left to (4,1), which is occupied by body segment 1. Since I don't eat food (no food at (4,1)), tail moves. Current tail is (3,2). After move, head at (4,1), body: (5,1), (4,1)? Old head was (5,1), so new body segment at (5,1). But (4,1) was segment 1, now it will be segment 2? Let's see: after move, head to (4,1), but (4,1) was occupied by segment 1. Since tail moves, the segment that was at (4,1) will move to new position? But head is moving to (4,1), which is currently occupied.\n> \n> Specifically: if I move to (4,1), which is currently the position of the first body segment. After the move, since no food eaten, the body segments shift: the new head is at (4,1), new segment 1 is old head (5,1), new segment 2 is old segment 1, which was (4,1), but now it moves to where? The positions: after move, head at (4,1), then segment 1 at old head (5,1), segment 2 at old segment 1 position? No, each segment moves to the position of the previous segment in the chain.\n> \n> Standard: the segment i moves to the position that segment i-1 had before the move, for i from 1 to length, but with head being segment 0.\n> \n> Easier: after move, the new position of segment k is the old position of segment k-1 for k >=1, and new head is the new position.\n> \n> So, if head moves to (4,1), which is old position of segment 1.\n> \n> Then new positions: head: (4,1)\n> \n> segment 1: old head (5,1)\n> \n> segment 2: old segment 1 (4,1) — but (4,1) is where head just moved to? Conflict.\n> \n> Old positions: index 0: (5,1), index 1: (4,1), index 2: (3,1), etc.\n> \n> After moving head to (4,1):\n> \n> - New head: (4,1)\n> \n> - New segment 1: old head position, (5,1)\n> \n> - New segment 2: old segment 1 position, which is (4,1) — but (4,1) is now the head position, so new segment 2 would be at (4,1), but head is also at (4,1)? That can't be.\n> \n> I think I have a confusion.\n> \n> In snake, when you move, the head moves to a new cell, then each body segment moves to the cell where the segment ahead was. So the segment that was behind moves to the position that was just vacated.\n> \n> Specifically, for body segment i, it moves to the position that segment i-1 had before the move. Since segment i-1 has moved, that position is free except for the tail.\n> \n> But in terms of collision, when head moves to a cell, if that cell is occupied by a body segment that is not the tail, it collides because that segment will still be there after the move.\n> \n> If it is the tail, and no food eaten, the tail moves away, so it's safe.\n> \n> In this case, (4,1) is occupied by segment 1, which is not the tail (tail is segment 7 at (3,2)). So if head moves to (4,1), it would be moving to a cell occupied by segment 1. After the move, segment 1 will move to (5,1) (old head position), so (4,1) will be occupied by the head, but during the move, since the cell was occupied, it might be considered collision before the move or after?\n> \n> The rule says: \"body collision (head touches any body segment)\" — I think this means after the move, if the head is on a cell with a body segment.\n> \n> But after the move, the segments have moved.\n> \n> So for move to (4,1): after move, head is at (4,1). Where are the body segments? New segment 1 is at old head (5,1), new segment 2 is at old segment 1 (4,1)? No.\n> \n> List old positions: P0=(5,1), P1=(4,1), P2=(3,1), P3=(2,1), P4=(1,1), P5=(1,2), P6=(2,2), P7=(3,2)\n> \n> After head moves to new position, say Q.\n> \n> Then new positions: head at Q, segment 1 at P0, segment 2 at P1, segment 3 at P2, ..., segment 7 at P6.\n> \n> And P7 is abandoned.\n> \n> So if Q = (4,1), which is P1.\n> \n> Then new head: (4,1)\n> \n> new seg1: P0 = (5,1)\n> \n> new seg2: P1 = (4,1)  — but (4,1) is the same as head position! So head and seg2 are both at (4,1), collision.\n> \n> Yes, so moving to a body segment position that is not the tail causes collision because that segment will move to a new position, but in the new state, head is at Q, and seg2 is at P1, which if Q equals P1, then head and seg2 are on the same cell.\n> \n> Similarly, if Q is any Pi for i not 7 (tail), it will be occupied by seg_{i+1} or something.\n> \n> Generally, after move, the cell Q is head, and the cells P0 to P6 are occupied by seg1 to seg7, but P0 is now seg1, P1 is seg2, etc.\n> \n> So the cells occupied after move are: Q, P0, P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, P6.\n> \n> And P7 is free.\n> \n> Now, head is at Q, and the body segments are at P0 to P6.\n> \n> For collision, if Q is equal to any of P0 to P6, then head collides with that body segment.\n> \n> P0 to P6 are the old positions except tail.\n> \n> In this case, P0 to P6 are: (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2)\n> \n> P7 is (3,2) tail.\n> \n> So if head moves to Q, and Q is one of (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), then collision, because after move, that cell is occupied by a body segment.\n> \n> If Q is P7, (3,2), then after move, head at (3,2), and body segments at P0 to P6, which are (5,1), (4,1), etc., so (3,2) is not in P0 to P6, since P6 is (2,2), P7 was (3,2) but not occupied after move. So moving to tail position is safe if no food eaten.\n> \n> But if food eaten, tail doesn't move, so if Q is food and we eat it, then new tail is added at the end, so positions: head at Q, body: P0, P1, ..., P7, and since Q was not occupied before, no collision, but if Q was tail, and we eat food, then head and the new tail are both at Q or adjacent? Let's not worry now.\n> \n> Back to moves.\n> \n> From (5,1), possible Q:\n> \n> - U: (5,2) — not in current body positions, and not wall, so safe.\n> \n> - D: (5,0) — y=0 wall, invalid.\n> \n> - L: (4,1) — which is in body positions, P1=(4,1), so if move to (4,1), after move, head at (4,1), and seg2 is at P1=(4,1), so same cell, collision. Invalid.\n> \n> - R: (6,1) — x=6, y=1. x=6 is not 0 or 7, y=1 not 0 or 7, not (1,6), so not wall. Is it occupied? Current positions: (5,1), (4,1), etc., (6,1) not listed, so free. After move, head at (6,1), body at (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), and tail at (3,2) moves away? New seg7 at P6=(2,2), so no one at (3,2). So (6,1) not occupied, safe.\n> \n> So allowed moves: U or R. D and L invalid.\n> \n> U leads to (5,2) with food, R to (6,1) empty.\n> \n> If I move U, I eat the food at (5,2).

Walls at borders and (1,6) obstacle.\n> \n> I should sketch a grid.\n> \n> Grid 8x8, cells (0,0) to (7,7), but walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so playable area x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x from 1 to 6 inclusive? Let's see: for example, (1,1) is snake, so x=1 is valid, not wall. Border cells are walls, so x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x from 1 to 6 are free, similarly y from 1 to 6. And (1,6) is obstacle, so (1,6) is blocked.\n> \n> So free cells: x=1 to 6, y=1 to6, except (1,6) is obstacle.\n> \n> Snake positions: (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2)\n> \n> So the snake is mostly on the bottom row, with a turn at (1,1) to (1,2) up, then to (2,2) right, to (3,2).\n> \n> Head at (5,1) moving right.\n> \n> Food at (5,2) with life span 8.\n> \n> If I eat the food now, I get +1, but I need to consider if it's safe long-term.\n> \n> After eating, snake length 9, head at (5,2), direction up (since I moved U).\n> \n> Then from there, I can move U, D, L, R, but no reverse, so since I just moved U, I cannot move D next turn.\n> \n> But let's plan sequence.\n> \n> Since the food has life span 8, I don't have to eat it immediately; I can eat it later, as long as before turn 25.\n> \n> But I need to think about survival and maximizing score. Currently only one food, so if I eat it, I get +1, but then I need to find other food, but no other food mentioned, so probably only one food for now. But food might spawn later, but the state doesn't say, so I think for this turn, only this food is present. I have to work with current state.\n> \n> The state says \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value\" and lists one food, so only this one for now.\n> \n> Life span 8 means it will disappear after 8 turns, so from turn 18, it will be gone after turn 25. Turn 18: life span 8, so after turn 18, it decreases to 7, then 6, ..., down to 0, and disappears when life span reaches 0? The rule says \"disappears after N turns\", \"countdown decreases every turn including current\", so at turn t with life span L, after the turn, if not eaten, life span becomes L-1, and when L=0 after the turn, it disappears.\n> \n> So for this food, at turn 18, life span 8. After turn 18, if not eaten, life span 7. After turn 19, 6, ..., after turn 25, life span 0, so it disappears, not available on turn 26.\n> \n> So I can eat it on any turn from 18 to 25.\n> \n> But I need to plan multiple moves.\n> \n> Now, if I eat it now, turn 18, I get the point, but then the snake is longer, which might make it harder to maneuver in the future, especially with walls and obstacles.\n> \n> The grid is small, 6x6 playable area with an obstacle.\n> \n> Playable cells: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, except (1,6) blocked, so 36 - 1 = 35 cells, but snake occupies 8, so 27 free, but with food at (5,2).\n> \n> After eating, if I eat, snake 9 cells, 26 free.\n> \n> But I need to avoid dead ends.\n> \n> Since I have to think 5+ turns, I should simulate possible paths.\n> \n> First option: move U to (5,2) and eat food.\n> \n> Then on turn 19, head at (5,2), direction U (since I moved up).\n> \n> Possible moves: U to (5,3), D to (5,1), but D is opposite to current direction?

It's turn 19. The grid has walls at the borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and one internal obstacle at (1,6). So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are at the edges, meaning I can't go to x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7. Also, (1,6) is blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (5,2), then body segments: (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2). So the snake has 9 segments. Head direction is Up, meaning it moved up to get to (5,2) from (5,1), I assume.\n> \n> Food: only one piece mentioned: at (5,5) with value 1 and life span 10. Since it's turn 19, and life span decreases every turn, including current, so in 10 turns, it will disappear if not eaten. Value is +1, so it's positive food.\n> \n> I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score, prioritizing long-term survival over immediate rewards. Also, avoid risks like collisions.\n> \n> First, let's sketch the grid. I'll make a small grid representation mentally.\n> \n> Grid size: from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls on borders, so playable area is x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? No, walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so cells from x=1 to x=6 and y=1 to y=6 are playable, except internal obstacles. Internal obstacle at (1,6), so (1,6) is blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions:\n> \n> - Head: (5,2)\n> \n> - Body: (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2)\n> \n> So the snake is coiled around the bottom-left area. From head (5,2), up to (5,1) is down? Head is at (5,2), and next is (5,1), which is below, so the snake is moving upward to (5,2), so from (5,1) to (5,2) was up.\n> \n> Directions: head direction is U, so it's facing up.\n> \n> Now, possible moves: since head is at (5,2) facing U, I can move U, L, or R, but not D because that would be instant reverse? No instant reverse means I can't move opposite to current direction on the next turn. Current direction is U, so I can't move D immediately. So possible actions: U (up to (5,3)), L (left to (4,2)), R (right to (6,2)).\n> \n> Now, check for collisions or walls.\n> \n> - U to (5,3): what's there? Snake positions: (5,3) not listed, so it should be empty or food? Food is at (5,5), not (5,3). Walls: y=7 is wall, but (5,3) is y=3, x=5, which should be within bounds. x=5, y=3, walls are at x=0,7 and y=0,7, so (5,3) is safe, no wall. Is it occupied? Snake has segments at (5,2), (5,1), etc., but not (5,3), so it should be free.\n> \n> - L to (4,2): (4,2) is occupied by a body segment? Snake positions: (4,1), (3,1), etc., but (4,2) is listed as a body segment? Positions: (5,2) head, then (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2). So (4,2) is not in the list; it's free? (4,2) is not mentioned, so it should be empty.\n> \n> Similarly, R to (6,2): (6,2) not in snake positions, no wall, so free.\n> \n> Also, (5,3) is free.\n> \n> But I need to think about the food.

But I need to consider the path and what happens after eating.\n> \n> Also, life span is 10, so it will disappear at turn 19 + 10 - 1? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 19, life span is 10, so after 10 turns, it will be gone. On turn 19, it's present, and countdown decreases each turn, so on turn 20, life span 9, ..., down to turn 28, life span 1, and on turn 29, it disappears?

It's turn 20, and I'm playing Snake on a grid with walls and one internal obstacle. The grid has borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7). The internal obstacle is at (1,6).\n> \n> Snake positions: Head is at (5,3), and the body segments follow: (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2). So the snake is 9 segments long.\n> \n> Head direction is Up, which is U, meaning it's moving towards increasing y.\n> \n> Food: There's one food at (5,5) with value 1 and life span 9. Since life span decreases every turn, including the current one, it will disappear after 9 more turns, so it will be gone by turn 29.\n> \n> I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks. The goal is to eat positive food but prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> First, let's visualize the grid. I should sketch this out mentally.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n> \n> Walls: Borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So cells like (0,y), (7,y), (x,0), (x,7) are walls.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (1,6).\n> \n> Snake: Head at (5,3), then down to (5,2), (5,1), then left to (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), then up to (1,2), then right to (2,2). So the snake is kind of coiled or has a bend.\n> \n> From (1,1) to (1,2) is up, then to (2,2) is right. So positions: (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2). So the tail is at (2,2).\n> \n> Head direction is U, so it's moving up. From (5,3), moving up would go to (5,4).\n> \n> Possible moves: Since head direction is U, I can move U, L, or R, but not D because that would be instant reverse. Rule: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\" Current direction is U, so opposite is D, which is not allowed. So I can go U (up), L (left), or R (right).\n> \n> Now, food is at (5,5). Since head is at (5,3), moving up would go to (5,4), then to (5,5) in two moves if I keep going up.\n> \n> But I need to think about risks.

Snake positions: (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2). None at (5,4), so empty. Not a wall, since y=4, not 0 or 7, x=5 not 0 or 7, and (1,6) is obstacle but different position. So (5,4) is free.\n> \n> - (4,3): similarly, not in snake positions, not wall.

Are they adjacent? (5,5) and (2,2): delta x=3, delta y=3, not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing an edge, so |dx|<=1 and |dy|<=1 and not both zero. Here |dx|=3, |dy|=3, not adjacent. So no issue.\n> \n> Moreover, when I eat, the tail doesn't move that turn, but since food is not at tail, it should be fine.\n> \n> Rule: when you eat, the tail doesn't move, so snake grows.\n> \n> But in this case, food at (5,5), not at tail.\n> \n> So moving U twice: turn 20 to (5,4), turn 21 to (5,5) eat food.\n> \n> But after eating on turn 21, head at (5,5), and new segment added, so snake becomes positions: [(5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2)]? Let's trace.\n> \n> After move to (5,4) on turn 20: head moves to (5,4), tail moves? When snake moves, head to new position, each segment moves to the next position, tail is removed unless eating.\n> \n> On turn 20, move to (5,4): so new positions: head (5,4), then previous head (5,3) becomes body, so body: (5,3), then (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), etc., down to (2,2). Since no eating, tail (2,2) is removed? No.\n> \n> Snake movement: when moving without eating, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, and the tail cell is vacated.\n> \n> So from turn 19 to turn 20, but we start at turn 20 with positions given.\n> \n> At turn 20, positions are given. When I choose action for turn 20, I move to a new cell.\n> \n> If I move to (5,4), and since no food there, snake moves: head to (5,4), then body: the first body segment moves to where head was (5,3), second to where first was (5,2), and so on, down to tail: the tail at (2,2) moves to where the previous tail segment was? Let's list the segments in order.\n> \n> Snake positions at turn 20: index 0: head (5,3), 1: (5,2), 2: (5,1), 3: (4,1), 4: (3,1), 5: (2,1), 6: (1,1), 7: (1,2), 8: (2,2) tail.\n> \n> If I move U to (5,4):\n> \n> - New head: (5,4)\n> \n> - Then segment 1 moves to old head position (5,3)\n> \n> - Segment 2 moves to old segment 1 position (5,2)\n> \n> - Segment 3 moves to old segment 2 position (5,1)\n> \n> - Segment 4 moves to old segment 3 position (4,1)\n> \n> - Segment 5 moves to old segment 4 position (3,1)\n> \n> - Segment 6 moves to old segment 5 position (2,1)\n> \n> - Segment 7 moves to old segment 6 position (1,1)\n> \n> - Segment 8 (tail) moves to old segment 7 position (1,2)\n> \n> Since no eating, the old tail position (2,2) is vacated.\n> \n> New positions: head (5,4), body: (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2) and tail is (1,2)?

So tail is at (1,2).\n> \n> Now, is there any danger? Head at (5,5), which is not adjacent to any body part except (5,4) which is the neck, but that's fine.

Since turn 20, life span 9, so it will be there until turn 28? Let's see: life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 20, life span 9, meaning it has 9 turns left, so it disappears at the start of turn 29 or after turn 28? The rule says: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So at turn t, if food has life span L, it will be there for L more turns, so disappears when countdown reaches 0, which is after L turns.\n> \n> At turn t, life span L, then at turn t+1, life span L-1, ..., at turn t+L-1, life span 1, then at turn t+L, it disappears, so not available on turn t+L.\n> \n> In this case, turn 20, life span 9, so available on turns 20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28.

It's turn 21, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid is from (0,0) to (7,7), with walls on the borders.\n> \n> There's an internal obstacle at (1,6). So that cell is blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions: Head is at (5,4), and the body segments follow: (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2). So the snake has 9 segments. Head is at (5,4), and it's moving upwards, since head direction is U.\n> \n> Food: Only one food item at (5,5) with value 1 and life span 8. Since it's positive food, eating it gives +1 score and increases length by 1.\n> \n> Life span is 8, meaning it will disappear after 8 turns, including the current turn. So it will be gone by turn 28 if not eaten.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks. Prioritize long-term survival over immediate rewards.\n> \n> Current head position: (5,4), direction U. Moving up would go to (5,5), which is where the food is. But I need to check if that's safe.\n> \n> First, what are the possible moves? Since head direction is U, I can move U, L, or R, but not D because that would be instant reverse, which is not allowed. The rules say: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\" So current direction is U, so I cannot move D. So possible moves: U, L, R.\n> \n> Now, moving U to (5,5): That's the food position. But I need to check if I can eat it safely.\n> \n> The food is at (5,5), and snake head is at (5,4). Moving up to (5,5) would eat the food if it's available.\n> \n> But there's a special case: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if the body moves away and the head moves onto it.\" Here, the food is at (5,5), which is not under the snake's body currently. Snake body positions: (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), etc. (5,5) is not in the snake positions, so it should be fine to eat directly.\n> \n> Snake positions: [(5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2)] — so (5,5) is not occupied by snake, so moving there should allow eating the food.\n> \n> But there's a danger: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake.\n> \n> Where is the tail? Snake positions: head (5,4), then body, tail is the last segment, which is (1,2).\n> \n> Tail is at (1,2). Head is at (5,4), which is not adjacent to (1,2). Adjacent means sharing an edge, so (5,4) and (1,2) are far apart. Distance: |5-1|=4, |4-2|=2, not adjacent.\n> \n> So no issue with tail reward danger here.\n> \n> Therefore, moving up to (5,5) should eat the food, increasing length to 10, and score +1.\n> \n> But I need to think ahead for survival.\n> \n> After eating, the snake will grow, so the tail won't move immediately? No, when you eat food, the snake grows by one segment at the end, but the movement: when you move to a new cell, if you eat food, you add a segment, so the tail stays in place. But in the next move, the tail moves forward.\n> \n> Standard snake mechanics: when head moves to a cell with food, it eats it, and the new segment is added at the head position, so the snake grows immediately, meaning that after eating, the tail doesn't move in that turn; the head moves to the food, eats it, and the new tail position is where the head was, but since it grows, the segment count increases.\n> \n> Perhaps I should simulate the movement.\n> \n> Current turn: t=21.\n> \n> If I move U to (5,5), eat food. Then new snake positions: head moves to (5,5), and since food is eaten, a new segment is added, so the body includes the previous head position. So new positions: head at (5,5), then previous segments: (5,4) becomes the first body segment, then (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), etc., and tail at (1,2) remains, but since we add a segment, the tail doesn't move; we have one more segment.\n> \n> After eating, the snake length increases, so positions become: [ (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2) ] — (1,2) is now the second last, and tail is (1,1)? Let's list:\n> \n> Before move: positions: [ (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2) ] so head (5,4), tail (1,2).\n> \n> After move U: head moves to (5,5), and since food is eaten, the tail does not move; we add a new segment at the end? No.\n> \n> Standard: when snake moves, head goes to new position, each segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead. If no food eaten, tail moves away. If food eaten, tail stays, so new segment is added.\n> \n> In this case: after moving to (5,5) and eating, the new positions: head at (5,5), then the previous head (5,4) becomes body, so [ (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2) ] — now there are 10 segments. Tail is (1,2), but (1,1) is also there. Positions: index 0: (5,5) head, 1: (5,4), 2: (5,3), 3: (5,2), 4: (5,1), 5: (4,1), 6: (3,1), 7: (2,1), 8: (1,1), 9: (1,2) tail. So tail is at (1,2).\n> \n> (1,1) is segment 8, (1,2) is segment 9, tail.\n> \n> But (1,1) and (1,2) are adjacent, but that's fine.\n> \n> Now, after this move, head is at (5,5), direction is U (since I moved up).\n> \n> Now, I need to plan for future turns.\n> \n> But I should consider other moves and think ahead.\n> \n> First, immediate move: moving U to eat food seems good, but is it safe?\n> \n> After moving to (5,5), what are the surroundings?\n> \n> Grid: walls at x=0,7 and y=0,7, obstacle at (1,6).\n> \n> From (5,5), possible moves: U, D, L, R. But current direction is U, so I cannot move D (reverse) next turn? After moving U, the new head direction is U, so for the next turn, I can move U, L, R, but not D.\n> \n> Now, positions: head at (5,5), body at (5,4), (5,3), etc.\n> \n> Moving U to (5,6): is that safe? (5,6) is within bounds? y=6, since walls at y=7, so y=6 is ok, x=5 between 0-7.\n> \n> Is (5,6) occupied? Snake positions: after move, body has (5,4), (5,3), etc., but (5,6) is not in the positions, so it should be free.\n> \n> (5,6) is empty, no wall, obstacle is at (1,6), not (5,6).\n> \n> So moving U to (5,6) is possible.\n> \n> But I need to think about long-term.\n> \n> Moving L to (4,5) or R to (6,5) might be options, but since there's food at (5,5), not moving there might miss the opportunity, and life span is 8, so it will be there for 8 turns, but I should eat it if possible to avoid it disappearing or risks later.\n> \n> But the food is directly above, and moving up eats it, which is good for score and growth.\n> \n> But let's think about the risks after eating.\n> \n> After eating, snake is at (5,5), with body below: (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), then (4,1), etc.\n> \n> The grid has an obstacle at (1,6), but that's not near.\n> \n> Now, the snake is mostly in the bottom-left, but head is at (5,5).\n> \n> I need to consider the available space and potential dead ends.\n> \n> Since the snake is long, 10 segments after eating, and the grid is 8x8 minus walls and obstacles, but walls are borders, so playable area is 6x6? x from 1 to 6? Walls at x=0 and x=7, so x=1 to 6 inclusive? Let's clarify.\n> \n> Walls: border cells x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7. So the playable grid is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think? x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6?

It's turn 22. The grid has walls on the borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. There's also an internal obstacle at (1,6).

Walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7, but walls are at the borders, so playable area is x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? Let's confirm.\n> \n> Border cells: x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. Internal obstacle at (1,6). So playable cells are from x=1 to 6 and y=1 to 6, except where obstacles are. (1,6) is an obstacle, so not accessible.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (5,5), body segments down to (5,1), then left to (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), and tail at (1,2). So the snake is mostly vertical from (1,1) to (5,1) then up to (5,5), with a turn at (5,1) to (4,1), etc. Let's list the positions in order:\n> \n> - Head: (5,5) - moving up\n> \n> - Next: (5,4)\n> \n> - Then: (5,3)\n> \n> - Then: (5,2)\n> \n> - Then: (5,1)\n> \n> - Then: (4,1)\n> \n> - Then: (3,1)\n> \n> - Then: (2,1)\n> \n> - Then: (1,1)\n> \n> - Tail: (1,2)\n> \n> (1,2) is the tail?

(1,1) to (1,2) is moving right, but head is at (5,5) moving up.\n> \n> The direction is given as head direction U, so current movement is up.\n> \n> Now, food is at (4,6) with value 1, life span 10.\n> \n> Since the head is at (5,5) and moving up, if it continues up, it goes to (5,6). But y=6 is a border wall? Walls at y=0 and y=7, so y=6 should be playable? y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y from 1 to 6 are playable, I think.\n> \n> Border cells: y=0 and y=7 are walls. So y=1 to y=6 are inside.

No, walls are borders and (1,6). (5,6) y=6, which is not wall, and not obstacle. Obstacle is only (1,6).\n> \n> So (5,6) is empty.\n> \n> - Down: (5,4) — occupied by body\n> \n> - Left: (4,5) — is this occupied?

Then from there, I can go to (4,6) or (5,7) but y=7 is wall, so not possible, or (6,6), or back down but might be body later.\n> \n> (5,7) is y=7, which is wall, so invalid.\n> \n> From (5,6), possible moves: up? (5,7) wall, invalid. Down to (5,5), but (5,5) will be body after move. When I move to (5,6), the snake head moves to (5,6), and the tail might move or not depending on eating.\n> \n> But in this move, I'm not eating food, so no growth, tail moves away.\n> \n> Currently, food is at (4,6), not eaten yet.\n> \n> If I move U to (5,6), I don't eat food, so snake moves to (5,6), body follows, so the segment at (5,5) becomes body, (5,4) to (5,3) etc., and tail at (1,2) moves to where? Current tail is at (1,2), but when snake moves without eating, the tail moves forward.\n> \n> Positions: after moving head to (5,6), the body segments shift: new head (5,6), then (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1).

It's turn 23, and I have to plan my actions for the next few turns, thinking at least 5 turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n> \n> The grid has walls: border cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the playable area is from x=1 to x=6 and y=1 to y=6? Let me confirm. Walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, meaning those coordinates are blocked. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (1,6).\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (4,5), then (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1). So the snake is 10 segments long. Head direction is left (L), meaning it was moving left to (4,5) from (5,5)? Positions are listed head first, so from head to tail: (4,5) is head, then (5,5) is the first body segment, and so on, down to (1,1) as tail.\n> \n> Food: only one food item at (4,6) with value 1 and life span 9. Since it's turn 23, and life span 9, it will disappear after 9 turns, so on turn 32 (23+9=32). Value is +1, so positive food.\n> \n> I need to think about moving towards this food or other possibilities, but there's only one food right now. The grid might have other cells, but no other food is listed, so I assume only this one food is present.\n> \n> Playable grid: since walls at x=0,7 and y=0,7, the valid cells are x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6. But there's an internal obstacle at (1,6), so (1,6) is blocked. Also, snake occupies several cells.\n> \n> List all occupied cells to avoid collisions.\n> \n> Snake occupies: (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1)\n> \n> Walls: borders x=0,7 and y=0,7, and obstacle (1,6)\n> \n> Food at (4,6)\n> \n> Now, head is at (4,5) with direction L. Since it's moving left, the previous position was to the right, which is (5,5), so from (5,5) to (4,5) left.\n> \n> Current possible moves: since head direction is L, I can move L, U, or D, but not R instantly because reverse is not allowed. The rule says \"no instant reverse\", so I cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn. Current direction is L, so I cannot move R on this turn.\n> \n> So from (4,5), possible moves:\n> \n> - Left (L): to (3,5)\n> \n> - Up (U): to (4,6)\n> \n> - Down (D): to (4,4)\n> \n> - Right (R): not allowed, opposite direction.\n> \n> Now, check if these cells are safe:\n> \n> - (3,5): is this occupied or wall? Walls are at borders, so x=0,7 y=0,7. (3,5) is within 1-6,1-6, not a wall. Snake positions: (3,5) is not in the list: snake has (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), etc., no (3,5), so it should be free, except for possible food, but no food there.\n> \n> - (4,6): this is where the food is. But is it safe to move there? (4,6) is within grid, not wall, and not occupied by snake body. Snake has positions, (4,6) not listed, so it's free. But moving to (4,6) would eat the food since head moves onto it.\n> \n> - (4,4): similarly, within grid, not wall, not in snake positions, so free.\n> \n> Now, moving to (4,6) would eat the food, since it's positive food, value +1, so snake length increases by 1.\n> \n> But I need to think long-term. Also, there's a rule about \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills. But here, tail is at (1,1), which is far, not adjacent to head. Head at (4,5), tail at (1,1), not adjacent. So no issue.\n> \n> After eating food, the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move that turn, right? When you eat food, the length increases, so the tail stays in place, and a new segment is added at head.\n> \n> Standard snake: when you eat, you grow, so the tail doesn't move for that turn, meaning the cell where tail was remains until next move.\n> \n> But in terms of collision, after moving to food, head is at (4,6), and since it ate, the tail remains at (1,1) for this turn, so no immediate collision.\n> \n> But I need to plan multiple turns.\n> \n> First, let's consider moving to the food directly: on turn 23, move U to (4,6).\n> \n> Then, after that, snake will be at positions: head at (4,6), then the body: since it ate, the tail doesn't move, so new positions: [(4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1)] but since it grew, tail stays, so positions are [ (4,6) , (4,5) , (5,5) , (5,4) , (5,3) , (5,2) , (5,1) , (4,1) , (3,1) , (2,1) , (1,1) ] and length is now 11.\n> \n> Then, for next turn, I need to move from (4,6). But what direction? After moving U, the new head direction would be U.\n> \n> Then possible moves from (4,6): U, L, R, but not D (reverse).\n> \n> Now, (4,6) is at y=6, which is the top row? Walls at y=7 and y=0, so y=6 is the highest y, since y=7 is wall. Grid from y=1 to y=6, I think. y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=1 to y=6 are playable, y=6 is the top row.\n> \n> Similarly, x=1 to x=6.\n> \n> At (4,6), moving U would go to (4,7), but y=7 is wall, so invalid, collision. So I cannot move U from (4,6).\n> \n> Possible moves: L to (3,6), R to (5,6), D to (4,5).\n> \n> But D is down, which might be reverse? Current direction after move U would be U, so moving D would be opposite, so not allowed. \"No instant reverse\", so from current direction U, I cannot move D on the next turn.\n> \n> Similarly, from (4,6) with direction U, I can move L, R, or U, but U is to (4,7) which is wall, so invalid. So only possible: L to (3,6) or R to (5,6).\n> \n> Now, check these cells.\n> \n> (3,6): is it free? Snake positions after eating: (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), etc., and (1,1). (3,6) not occupied.

It's turn 25, and the grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So cells from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are on the borders, so the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think? Let me confirm.\n> \n> Border cells: x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. So the grid is 8x8, but since x and y go from 0 to 7, the accessible cells are x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? No, walls are at the borders, so moving to x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 is deadly. But positions can be from (0,0) to (7,7), but (0,0) etc. are walls, so snake can't be there. Snake positions are given, and they are within 1 to 6 in x and y, I think.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (3,6), then (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1). So x from 2 to 5, y from 1 to 6. All within bounds, since walls are at x=0,7 and y=0,7.\n> \n> Also, there's an internal obstacle at (1,6). So (1,6) is a wall cell.\n> \n> Now, head direction is L, which is left, so moving towards decreasing x.\n> \n> Food: only one food at (6,3) with value 1 and life span 10. Since it's turn 25, and life span 10, it will disappear after 10 turns, so on turn 35 it will be gone? Life span decreases every turn including current, so on turn t, if life span is N, it disappears after N turns, meaning after turn t + N -1 or something? Let's clarify.\n> \n> From the rules: \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So if on turn t, a food has life_span L, then:\n> \n> - On turn t, life_span = L\n> \n> - After turn t, life_span becomes L-1 for the next turn.\n> \n> - It disappears when life_span reaches 0, I think. But it says \"disappears after N turns\", meaning after N turns from now.\n> \n> For example, if life_span is 10 on turn t, then after 10 turns, on turn t+10, it should be gone, but let's see the countdown.\n> \n> \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" – this might be a bit ambiguous.\n> \n> I think it's better to think: at the start of turn t, if a food has life_span S, then after this turn, S decreases by 1, and if S becomes 0, it disappears before the next turn.\n> \n> But the rule says: \"Disappears after N turns\" and N is the life_span given.\n> \n> Also, for the current turn, we have the life_span value.\n> \n> In this case, turn 25, food at (6,3) with life_span 10.\n> \n> So, after 10 turns, it will disappear. Meaning, on turn 26, life_span becomes 9, and so on, until turn 35, when life_span would be 0, and it disappears before turn 36, I suppose. But for eating, as long as life_span >0 when the head moves onto it, it can be eaten.\n> \n> Specifically, when the head moves to a food cell, if life_span >0, it gets eaten.\n> \n> Now, the food has value +1, so it's positive food.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan an action sequence for multiple turns, thinking 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> First, let's map out the grid.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n> \n> Walls: all border cells: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls.

Let's read.\n> \n> \"head touches any body segment\" is deadly, but exception: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, if the head moves to the tail's current position, it's ok, because after the move, the tail moves away, so head and tail are not colliding.\n> \n> In this case, for move to (2,6): current tail is at (2,1), not (2,6), so (2,6) is empty, so safe.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,5) is empty, safe.\n> \n> Now, food is at (6,3), which is far away.\n> \n> I need to think about getting to the food while avoiding risks.\n> \n> Also, since I have to think 5+ turns ahead, I should plan a path.\n> \n> First, let's sketch the grid.\n> \n> Label x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n> \n> Walls: all cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and (1,6).\n> \n> So playable area: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, except (1,6) blocked.\n> \n> Now snake: head at (3,6), body: (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), tail at (2,1).\n> \n> So the snake is mostly on the right and bottom, with head at top-left part? (3,6) is y=6, which is top row, x=3.\n> \n> y=6 is the top row since y=7 is wall, so y=6 is accessible, but below is y=5, etc.\n> \n> Let's think y=0 bottom, y=7 top, I assume? In coordinates, (x,y), with U increasing y, so y=0 bottom, y=7 top? But walls at y=0 and y=7, so y=1 to y=6 are playable.\n> \n> Similarly, x=0 left, x=7 right.\n> \n> So head at (3,6): x=3, y=6, which is top row.\n> \n> Then to (4,6) same row, then down to (4,5), then to (5,5), down to (5,4), down to (5,3), down to (5,2), down to (5,1), then left to (4,1), left to (3,1), left to (2,1).\n> \n> So the snake is like: from (3,6) left to (2,6)? No, current positions only.\n> \n> Food at (6,3), which is bottom-right, x=6,y=3.\n> \n> Life span 10, so it will be there for 10 turns from now, meaning until turn 34? Let's calculate.\n> \n> Turn 25: life_span 10\n> \n> After turn 25, before turn 26, life_span decreases to 9? The rule: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> I think it's: at the beginning of turn, the life_span is as given, and after the turn, it decreases by 1.\n> \n> But for eating, when you move to the cell during the turn, you can eat it if life_span >0.\n> \n> Since countdown includes current turn, on turn t with life_span N, it can be eaten on this turn, and after this turn, life_span becomes N-1 for the next turn.\n> \n> It disappears when life_span reaches 0, I think.\n> \n> Rule: \"Disappears after N turns\" – after N turns from now.\n> \n> So if on turn t, life_span N, it disappears after N turns, so it can be eaten up to turn t + N - 1.\n> \n> For example, turn t: life_span N, can be eaten.\n> \n> After turn t, life_span N-1.\n> \n> On turn t+1, life_span N-1, can be eaten if N-1 >0.\n> \n> ...\n> \n> On turn t + k, life_span N - k, can be eaten if N - k >0.\n> \n> It disappears when N - k = 0, so after turn t + N -1, it is gone for turn t + N.\n> \n> In this case, turn 25, life_span 10, so it can be eaten from turn 25 to turn 34 (since 25 + 10 - 1 = 34). On turn 34, life_span = 10 - (34-25) = 10 - 9 =1?

It's turn 26, and the grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So coordinates range from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are at the borders, meaning I can't go to x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (1,6).\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (3,5), and the body segments follow: (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1). So the snake is 11 segments long. Head direction is down, which is D. That means last move was down, so from (3,6) to (3,5), I think? Let's list the positions in order: head (3,5), then (3,6), which is above it, so if head is at (3,5) and moving down, it should be going to lower y, but (3,6) has higher y, so let's clarify.\n> \n> Positions: [(3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1)]\n> \n> Head is at (3,5), and the next segment is (3,6). (3,6) has y=6, which is north of (3,5) since y increases upwards? Typically in grids, y=0 is bottom or top? In the movement, U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), so y increases upwards, I assume. So (3,5) to (3,6) would be moving up, but head direction is given as D, down.\n> \n> Inconsistency: head is at (3,5), and the second segment is at (3,6). If y increases upwards, (3,6) is north, so one above. But head direction is D, which is down, meaning towards decreasing y. But from (3,6) to (3,5) would be down, since y decreases.\n> \n> Let's think of the snake movement. The positions are listed from head to tail. So at some previous turn, head was at (3,6), and it moved down to (3,5), so now head is at (3,5), and the segment that was at (3,6) is still there, but when snake moves, the tail moves, etc.\n> \n> In the list, position 0: head (3,5), position 1: (3,6), which is the segment behind the head. Since head moved down to (3,5), it was previously at (3,6), and direction was down to (3,5). Then the body follows: after (3,6) is (4,6), which might be from previous turns.\n> \n> Head direction is given as \"D\" for current state, meaning the snake is facing down, so last move was down to current position.\n> \n> Now, food: only one food given: (6,3) with life span 9 and value 1. Value 1 means positive food, since +1 reward and length increases. Life span 9, so it will disappear after 9 turns, including current turn. So from turn 26, it has 9 turns left, meaning it disappears after turn 34? Let's see: life span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 26, life span 9, so after turn 26, it will have 8 left, and so on, until it reaches 0 and disappears. After turn t, life span decreases by 1. So at turn 26, life span 9; after turn 26, it becomes 8; after turn 27, 7, ..., after turn 34, it becomes 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten from turn 26 to 34 inclusive? When exactly is it eaten?\n> \n> Food can be eaten when the head moves onto the cell during a turn. So if head moves to (6,3) on turn t, and food is still there, it is eaten.\n> \n> At turn 26, food at (6,3) has life span 9, meaning it will be present for turns 26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33, and on turn 34 it disappears before the move, I think? The rule says: \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So for food with life span L at turn t, it will disappear after t + L - 1 turns? Let's think.\n> \n> Suppose at turn t, food has life span L. After turn t, life span becomes L-1. After turn t+1, L-2, ..., after turn t + (L-1), life span becomes 0, and it disappears before turn t+L or after?\n> \n> The rule says: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> I think it's better to interpret: at the start of turn t, if food has life span s, it will be present for that turn. After the turn, life span decreases by 1. So if life span is s at turn start, after s turns, it will be gone. For example, at turn 26, life span 9, so it is present on turns 26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33, and after turn 33, life span becomes 0, so on turn 34, it is not present.\n> \n> Similarly, it can be eaten on any turn from 26 to 33 if head moves to (6,3) on that turn.\n> \n> Now, back to snake. Head at (3,5), direction down. Possible moves: since direction is down, I can move down, left, or right, but not up because no instant reverse. Reverse of down is up, so I cannot move up on next turn.\n> \n> Current head direction is D, so I can move D, L, or R, but not U.\n> \n> Now, grid: walls at borders x=0,7 and y=0,7, so I cannot go to x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Also internal obstacle at (1,6).\n> \n> Snake positions: let's plot this to visualize.\n> \n> Grid 8x8, cells (0,0) to (7,7), but walls at x=0,7 and y=0,7, so playable area is x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? No, x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, but let's confirm.\n> \n> Walls: x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are wall cells. So for example, (0,1) is wall, (1,0) wall, etc. Playable cells: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (1,6), which is within playable area, so (1,6) is blocked.\n> \n> Now snake: head (3,5), body: (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1)\n> \n> Let's list all occupied cells by snake:\n> \n> - (3,5) head\n> \n> - (3,6) body\n> \n> - (4,6) body\n> \n> - (4,5) body\n> \n> - (5,5) body\n> \n> - (5,4) body\n> \n> - (5,3) body\n> \n> - (5,2) body\n> \n> - (5,1) body\n> \n> - (4,1) body\n> \n> - (3,1) tail\n> \n> Now, food at (6,3) with value +1, life span 9.\n> \n> I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score, prioritize survival.\n> \n> First, where can I move now at turn 26.\n> \n> Head at (3,5), direction D.\n> \n> Possible moves:\n> \n> - Down (D): to (3,4). Is (3,4) valid? Check if wall or body.\n> \n> Walls: x=0,7 y=0,7, so (3,4) is x=3,y=4, within 1-6, not wall. Body: is (3,4) occupied? Snake positions: (3,5), (3,6), etc. (3,4) not in list, so empty, I think. Let's see all y: positions have y=5,6,5,5,4,3,2,1,1,1. (3,4) not listed, so free. But is it safe? Moving to (3,4), then the snake body will move; tail will move from (3,1) to wherever, but since head moves, the segment at (3,6) will become the new neck, etc.\n> \n> After move, the new head position is where I move, and the tail moves forward, so cells are freed except if I eat food.\n> \n> But here, no food at (3,4), so after moving to (3,4), the tail (3,1) will be removed, so (3,4) becomes head, (3,5) becomes body, (3,6) body, etc., and tail (3,1) is removed.\n> \n> But (3,4) is free now, so moving D to (3,4) should be safe.\n> \n> - Left (L): to (2,5). (2,5): x=2,y=5, not wall, not in snake positions? Positions: all x=3,4,5 except tail (3,1) etc. (2,5) not occupied, so should be free.\n> \n> - Right (R): to (4,5). (4,5) is occupied by body! (4,5) is the fourth segment, index 3 in list: positions[3] is (4,5), which is body. So if I move right to (4,5), head would collide with body segment, which is deadly. So I cannot move right.\n> \n> Cannot move right.\n> \n> - Up (U): to (3,6). But (3,6) is occupied by body segment, position[1] (3,6). Also, since current direction is D, moving U is reverse, which is not allowed. So cannot move up.\n> \n> So possible moves: Down to (3,4) or Left to (2,5).\n> \n> Now, I need to think about the food at (6,3).\n> \n> (6,3) is at x=6,y=3. Currently, snake head is at (3,5), so it's 3 steps right and 2 steps down, or something.\n> \n> Distance: Δx = 3, Δy = -2, since y=5 to y=3 is down, decreasing y.\n> \n> To reach (6,3) from (3,5), I need to move right 3 times and down 2 times, but not necessarily straight; I need to plan a path.\n> \n> But I must avoid walls, obstacles, and body collisions.\n> \n> Also, the snake body is long, so I need to be careful not to trap myself.\n> \n> Moreover, there's the tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> But here, tail is at (3,1), which is not adjacent to head. Head at (3,5), tail at (3,1), distance is 4 in y, not adjacent. Adjacent would be one cell away, like same x y±1 or same y x±1.\n> \n> So no issue now.\n> \n> But food at (6,3) might be under body or something? Let's see if (6,3) is occupied.\n> \n> Food positions: (6,3) is given, and snake positions do not include (6,3), so it's free, not under snake.\n> \n> The rule says food can spawn under body, but in this case, it's not; it's at (6,3), which is empty.\n> \n> Now, life span 9, so I have until turn 33 to eat it, I think. Turn 26 to 33, 8 turns? At turn 26, life span 9, so after 9 turns it disappears. After turn 26: span 8, turn 27:7, ..., turn 34:0, not present. So last chance to eat is on turn 33, when head moves to it on turn 33.\n> \n> Turn 33: if head moves to (6,3) on turn 33, and life span was 1 at start of turn, after move it decreases, but since eaten, it disappears.\n> \n> So I can eat it from turn 26 to 33.\n> \n> Now, distance: from (3,5) to (6,3), min moves: |3-6|=3 in x, |5-3|=2 in y, so at least 3 moves if I go diagonally, but I can only move orthogonally, so min 5 moves? No, since each move changes one coordinate, min moves is max(Δx, Δy) = max(3,2) = 3 moves? For example, right to (4,5), down to (4,4), right to (5,4), down to (5,3), right to (6,3). From (3,5) to (6,3): one way is R to (4,5), but (4,5) is occupied! I cannot move to (4,5) because body is there.\n> \n> (4,5) is a body segment, so I cannot move there directly.\n> \n> Other paths.\n> \n> For example, down to (3,4), then right to (4,4), then right to (5,4), but (5,4) is body? Positions: (5,4) is index 5, body segment.\n> \n> List of occupied cells: (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1)\n> \n> So occupied: (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1)\n> \n> Free cells: for example, (3,4) should be free, (4,4) free? (4,4) not in list, (5,4) is occupied, but (4,4) is not listed, so free.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,3) free, etc.\n> \n> From (3,5), I can move down to (3,4) or left to (2,5).\n> \n> Now, to reach (6,3), I need to go right and down.\n> \n> But directly right is blocked.\n> \n> So possible path: down to (3,4), then I can go right to (4,4), then to (5,4) but (5,4) is occupied, so not free. (5,4) is body, so I cannot move there unless the body moves away.\n> \n> But when I move, the snake moves, so cells become free.\n> \n> I need to simulate the movement.\n> \n> Also, the food has limited time, but 9 turns is plenty for min distance 3-4 moves.\n> \n> But I need to avoid dead ends.\n> \n> Moreover, I should think about the entire body.\n> \n> Now, tail is at (3,1), and head at (3,5), so the snake is coiled or something.\n> \n> Let me sketch the grid.\n> \n> Assume y from 0 to 7, bottom to top? Movement: U is (x,y+1), so y increases up, I think. So (0,0) bottom left, (7,7) top right? But walls at y=0 and y=7, so y=0 is bottom wall, y=7 top wall.\n> \n> Similarly x=0 left, x=7 right.\n> \n> Playable area: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (1,6), which is top-left area.\n> \n> Now snake:\n> \n> Head: (3,5)  // x=3,y=5\n> \n> Body: (3,6)  // above head? y=6\n> \n> Then (4,6)  // right\n> \n> Then (4,5)  // down\n> \n> Then (5,5)  // right\n> \n> Then (5,4)  // down\n> \n> Then (5,3)  // down\n> \n> Then (5,2)  // down\n> \n> Then (5,1)  // down\n> \n> Then (4,1)  // left\n> \n> Then (3,1)  // left, tail\n> \n> So the snake is like: from head (3,5), up to (3,6), right to (4,6), down to (4,5), right to (5,5), down to (5,4), down to (5,3), down to (5,2), down to (5,1), left to (4,1), left to (3,1).\n> \n> It's a bit snake-like shape.\n> \n> Now, the area around: for example, (3,4) is free, (4,4) free, (2,5) free, etc.\n> \n> Food at (6,3).\n> \n> (6,3) is to the right and down from head.\n> \n> Since (5,3) is occupied, I need to go around or wait for body to move.\n> \n> But body will move as I move.\n> \n> I need to plan a sequence to reach (6,3) safely.\n> \n> Also, after eating, snake grows, so it gets longer.\n> \n> Now, at turn 26, I can move down to (3,4) or left to (2,5).\n> \n> If I move down to (3,4), then head at (3,4), direction down (since I moved down).\n> \n> Then body: the segment at (3,6) will move to (3,5), etc., tail moves from (3,1) to (4,1)? Let's simulate.\n> \n> After move down to (3,4):\n> \n> New positions: head at (3,4)\n> \n> Then the previous head (3,5) becomes body, so body segments: (3,5), (3,6), but (3,6) was body, now it shifts.\n> \n> When snake moves without eating, head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, tail is removed.\n> \n> So from old positions: [ (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1) ]\n> \n> After moving head to (3,4):\n> \n> New head: (3,4)\n> \n> Then body: position 0 becomes body at old head position (3,5)\n> \n> Position 1 becomes at old position 0: (3,6) -> but no, the body segments shift: the first body segment moves to the old head position, which is (3,5)\n> \n> Then second body segment moves to old first body position, which is (3,6)\n> \n> List indices:\n> \n> Old: index 0: (3,5) head\n> \n> Index 1: (3,6) body\n> \n> Index 2: (4,6) body\n> \n> Index 3: (4,5) body\n> \n> Index 4: (5,5) body\n> \n> Index 5: (5,4) body\n> \n> Index 6: (5,3) body\n> \n> Index 7: (5,2) body\n> \n> Index 8: (5,1) body\n> \n> Index 9: (4,1) body\n> \n> Index 10: (3,1) tail\n> \n> After move down to (3,4):\n> \n> New head: (3,4)\n> \n> Then new body:\n> \n> Segment 1: old head position (3,5)\n> \n> Segment 2: old segment 1 position (3,6)\n> \n> Segment 3: old segment 2 position (4,6)\n> \n> Segment 4: old segment 3 position (4,5)\n> \n> Segment 5: old segment 4 position (5,5)\n> \n> Segment 6: old segment 5 position (5,4)\n> \n> Segment 7: old segment 6 position (5,3)\n> \n> Segment 8: old segment 7 position (5,2)\n> \n> Segment 9: old segment 8 position (5,1)\n> \n> Segment 10: old segment 9 position (4,1)\n> \n> The tail, segment 10, was at (3,1), but since no eat, tail is removed, so new snake has segments from 0 to 9, but length same, 11 segments?

It's turn 27, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid is from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls occupy those borders, meaning I can't move to x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (1,6).\n> \n> Snake positions: Head is at (2,5), and the body segments follow: (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1). So the snake is 11 segments long. Head direction is L, meaning left, so it was moving left last turn.\n> \n> Food: There's one food at (6,3) with life span 8 and value 1. Since value is 1, it's positive food. Life span 8 means it will disappear after 8 turns, including this one, so it has 7 more turns after turn 27 before it vanishes.\n> \n> I need to plan an action sequence for at least 5 turns ahead, starting from turn 27. The sequence should be for turns 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, etc., but since I have to think 5+ turns ahead, I should plan for several moves.\n> \n> First, let's visualize the grid. I'll sketch a grid from (0,0) to (7,7).\n> \n> - Walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are all walls. So accessible cells are x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? No, y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y from 1 to 6?

Also, internal obstacle at (1,6).\n> \n> So the playable area is x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except where obstacles are.\n> \n> x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x from 1 to 6 inclusive? For example, x=1 is not a wall, x=6 is not, but x=0 and x=7 are walls. Similarly, y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y from 1 to 6.\n> \n> y=0 is wall, y=7 is wall, so y from 1 to 6 is accessible? But y=1 to 6, that's 6 rows? Let's list coordinates.\n> \n> Assume min x=1, max x=6; min y=1, max y=6. But y=0 and y=7 are walls, so cells with y=1 to 6 are accessible.

Since it's moving left, the previous head was at (3,5) before moving to (2,5)? Snake positions are given in order: head first, so positions are at turn 27.\n> \n> Snake positions: [(2,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1)]\n> \n> So at turn 27, head is at (2,5), and it was moving left to get there, so from (3,5) to (2,5).\n> \n> Now, possible moves from (2,5): since head direction is L, I cannot instantly reverse to R, so I can't go right. Possible moves: Up, Down, Left.

It's at (6,3), which is far from current head at (2,5). Distance: delta x = 4, delta y = -2, so it's not adjacent.\n> \n> Life span 8, so it has until turn 27+7=34 to be eaten, since it disappears after N turns, including current, so after turn 27, it has turns 28,29,30,31,32,33,34 to be eaten, and disappears on turn 35? Let's clarify life span.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So for food at (6,3), life_span=8 at turn 27. That means on turn 27, life_span decreases to 7, then 6, etc., and when it reaches 0, it disappears. So it will disappear after 8 turns from when it was spawned? But we don't know when it was spawned.\n> \n> The life span is given at current turn, so at turn 27, it has life_span=8, meaning it has 8 turns left including turn 27. So after 8 more turns, it will be gone.

When can it be eaten? As long as it exists, which is when life_span >0.\n> \n> At turn 34, life_span=1, so it can be eaten on turn 34, and then on turn 35 it would be gone, but if eaten on 34, it's consumed.\n> \n> Similarly, on turn 27, it can be eaten if head moves there.\n> \n> But head is at (2,5), food at (6,3), so not immediate.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan a sequence to maximize score, but there's only one food, and it's positive.

Snake positions: (3,6) and (4,6) are occupied, but (2,6) is not in the list. Also, walls: not wall. Obstacle: (1,6) is obstacle, but (2,6) is fine. So (2,6) is free.\n> \n> (2,4): not in snake positions, not wall, should be free.\n> \n> (1,5): not in snake positions, not wall, obstacle at (1,6) but (1,5) is different, so free.\n> \n> Now, if I move to any of these, the snake will move: head to new position, and tail moves forward, so the segment at (4,1) will be removed, and a new segment added at head if I eat food, but no food at these positions, so length remains same, tail moves.\n> \n> Specifically, after move, new head position, and the body: the tail (4,1) is removed, and the new position becomes the head, so the body shifts.\n> \n> For example, if I move U to (2,6), new positions: head (2,6), then (2,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1) — and (4,1) is gone.\n> \n> Similarly for other moves.\n> \n> Now, I need to think about getting to the food at (6,3).\n> \n> But (6,3) is at x=6, y=3.

So, it disappears after turn 28 + 7 = 35? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 28, life span is 7, meaning it has 7 turns left, including this one. So it will disappear after turn 34? Let me calculate: at turn t, life span N means it disappears after N-1 turns? No.\n> \n> Life span: \"disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So for food at (6,3), life_span=7 at turn 28.

Turn 28 + 10 = 38, but since countdown decreases after each turn, including current:\n> \n> Let T be the turn when food appears or when we start counting.\n> \n> At turn t, life_span N means:\n> \n> - It is present from turn t to turn t + N - 1 inclusive? No.\n> \n> \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So, at the beginning of turn t, countdown is N.\n> \n> During turn t, it can be eaten.\n> \n> After turn t, countdown decreases to N-1.\n> \n> Similarly, after turn t+1, to N-2, ..., after turn t + k, to N - k -1? Better to think indices.\n> \n> Suppose at turn t, food has life_span N.\n> \n> - Turn t: countdown = N\n> \n> - After turn t is processed, countdown becomes N-1\n> \n> - Turn t+1: countdown = N-1\n> \n> - After turn t+1, becomes N-2\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - Turn t + N - 1: countdown = 1\n> \n> - After turn t + N - 1, countdown becomes 0, and food disappears, so not available for turn t + N.\n> \n> Therefore, for food at (6,3), life_span=7 at turn 28:\n> \n> Available until turn 28 + 7 - 1 = 34.

Movement: D is (x,y-1), so decreasing y. Walls: y=0 and y=7, so y=0 is bottom wall, y=7 top wall. So (2,3): x=2, y=3, within 1 to 6? Grid: x from 0 to 7, but x=0 and x=7 are walls, so valid x are 1 to 6? Similarly y=0 and y=7 walls, valid y 1 to 6.\n> \n> Let's clarify the grid.\n> \n> Walls: border cells x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.

Usually in coordinates, but movement: U (x,y+1) might be up or down, but typically in grids, y=0 bottom, y=6 top or something. But here, movement U (x,y+1) is up, D (x,y-1) down, so y increases up, decreases down.\n> \n> But walls: y=0 and y=7 walls, so y=1 bottom, y=6 top? y=0 is wall, so the lowest y is 1, which is bottom wall adjacent, but y=1 is playable? y=0 is wall, y=1 is not wall, similarly y=6 not wall, y=7 wall.\n> \n> So cells: y from 1 to 6, with y=1 bottom row, y=6 top row.\n> \n> Similarly x=1 left, x=6 right.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (1,6) — top-left? x=1,y=6.\n> \n> Now snake positions: head (2,4), body: (2,5) which is up, (3,5), (3,6) which is up-right, (4,6) up, (4,5) down, (5,5) right, (5,4) down, (5,3) down, (5,2) down, (5,1) down.

When food eaten, the head moves to food cell, and a new segment is added, so tail doesn't move.

It's turn 29, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since the walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. That means the grid goes from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are at the borders, so I can only move within (1,1) to (6,6), I think? Let me confirm.\n> \n> The walls are defined as border cells: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So, any cell with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 is a wall. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (1,6). So, cells (1,6) is blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (3,4), then body segments: (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1). So, the snake is 12 segments long. Head direction is R, which is right, so moving east.\n> \n> Food: There's one food at (6,3) with value 1 and life span 6. That means it will disappear after 6 turns, including the current turn. Since it's turn 29, the food will disappear after turn 34? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so if life span is 6 at turn 29, it will be 5 at turn 30, 4 at 31, ..., down to 0 at turn 34, and disappear after that, so last chance to eat it is turn 34.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score, prioritizing long-term survival.\n> \n> First, let's map out the grid. I'll sketch a grid to visualize.\n> \n> Grid from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls at borders, so playable area is x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, except obstacles.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (1,6), which is within bounds.\n> \n> Snake positions:\n> \n> - Head: (3,4)\n> \n> - Body: (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1)\n> \n> So, tail is at (5,1).\n> \n> Head direction is R, so last move was right to (3,4). From the positions, previous head was at (2,4)? Let's see the sequence: positions are given head first, so at turn 29, head is (3,4), then (2,4) is the first body segment, which was head at turn 28, I assume.\n> \n> But for movement, I care about the current head and direction.\n> \n> Current head at (3,4), moving right. So possible moves: U, D, L, R. But I cannot move opposite to current direction, which is R, so opposite is L. So I cannot move left. Also, moving left might not be possible due to body or walls, but let's check possible actions.\n> \n> Possible actions from (3,4):\n> \n> - U: up to (3,5)\n> \n> - D: down to (3,3)\n> \n> - L: left to (2,4) but cannot because it's opposite to R, and also it's occupied by body? (2,4) is a body segment, but since the snake will move, I need to see if it's safe.\n> \n> Movement rules: I can move to a cell only if it's not a wall and not occupied by body, except for the tail, because when I move, the tail moves away, so the tail cell becomes free after the move.\n> \n> Specifically: I can move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will move forward and vacate that cell.\n> \n> In this case, the tail is at (5,1), which is far away, so not adjacent.\n> \n> So, from (3,4):\n> \n> - U to (3,5): is this cell occupied? Snake positions: (3,5) is the fourth segment? Positions: index 0: head (3,4), 1: (2,4), 2: (2,5), 3: (3,5), 4: (3,6), 5: (4,6), 6: (4,5), 7: (5,5), 8: (5,4), 9: (5,3), 10: (5,2), 11: tail (5,1)\n> \n> So (3,5) is occupied by the third body segment (index 3). Since it's not the tail, if I move to (3,5), it will cause a collision because the body is there and won't move away before I arrive.\n> \n> When I move, the head moves to a new cell, and each body segment moves to the next position, so the cell that was occupied by the tail is vacated.\n> \n> But for a body segment, if I move the head to a cell that is currently occupied by a body segment, it will cause a collision unless it's the tail.\n> \n> In this case, (3,5) is the position of segment 3, which is not the tail. So if I move to (3,5), the head would be on that cell while the body is still there, so collision.\n> \n> Similarly, other cells.\n> \n> Available moves from (3,4):\n> \n> - U: (3,5) - occupied by body segment (3,5), not tail, so deadly.\n> \n> - D: (3,3) - is this free? Let's see the positions: none of the snake positions have (3,3), and walls: x=0,7 y=0,7, so (3,3) should be free. Also, no obstacle mentioned except (1,6), so (3,3) is empty and safe to move to.\n> \n> - L: (2,4) - but (2,4) is occupied by body segment 1. Not tail, so deadly. Also, cannot move opposite to current direction R. So illegal move anyway.\n> \n> - R: (4,4) - is this free? Positions: head is (3,4), next would be (4,4). Snake positions: (4,6), (4,5), (4,6) is segment 5, (4,5) is segment 6, (5,5) segment 7, etc. No (4,4) in the list, so empty. Walls: x=4, y=4 is within 1-6, so safe.\n> \n> y=4 is not border, borders are y=0 and y=7, so y=4 is fine.\n> \n> So possible moves: D or R. U is blocked by body, L is illegal and blocked.\n> \n> D: down to (3,3)\n> \n> R: right to (4,4)\n> \n> Now, there's food at (6,3) with value +1, life span 6.\n> \n> I need to get to (6,3) to eat it, but it has to be before turn 34.\n> \n> Current turn 29, so I have 5 turns to reach it?

It's 8x8? x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7, so 8 cells each way, but walls are at the borders, so playable area is x=1 to 6? No, walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the grid is from x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? Let's confirm.\n> \n> \"Border cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7\" means any cell with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 is a wall. Also, internal obstacle at (1,6).\n> \n> So, playable cells are x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except where walls are. (1,6) is a wall, so that's occupied.\n> \n> Now, snake positions:\n> \n> Head: (4,3)\n> \n> Body: (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3)\n> \n> Tail: (5,3)\n> \n> Food at (6,3) and (2,5).\n> \n> (2,5) is listed in food, but let's see if it's under the snake. Snake positions include (2,5), which is the fourth segment? Positions: index 0: head (4,3), 1: (3,3), 2: (3,4), 3: (2,4), 4: (2,5), 5: (3,5), etc.\n> \n> So (2,5) is occupied by the snake's body segment. But food is at (2,5) with value 1 and life span 10. According to the rules, food can spawn under the body, but it can only be eaten if the body moves away and then the head moves onto it.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,3) is a free cell, I think.

(2,5) is occupied.\n> \n> Food at (2,5) is under the snake body.\n> \n> Life span: for (6,3), life span 4, so it disappears after 4 turns, including current turn? \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" so at turn 31, life span 4, so it will be there for turns 31,32,33,34, and disappear after that, so not available on turn 35.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,5) has life span 10, so it will last until turn 40 or something.\n> \n> Turn 31, life span 10, so countdown: turn 31: 10, turn 32:9, ..., turn 40:1, turn 41:0 and disappear? Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Life-span disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so if life span is N at turn t, it will be present until turn t + N - 1, and disappear at turn t + N.\n> \n> For example, at turn t, life span N, then:\n> \n> - Turn t: countdown N\n> \n> - Turn t+1: countdown N-1\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - Turn t + N - 1: countdown 1\n> \n> - Turn t + N: countdown 0, food disappears.\n> \n> So for (6,3) at turn 31, life span 4, so available until turn 34 (countdown 1), disappears on turn 35.\n> \n> For (2,5), life span 10, available until turn 40, disappears on turn 41.\n> \n> Now, head is at (4,3), direction R, so it just moved to (4,3) from left? Previous position must be (3,3), but (3,3) is the second segment. Head was at (3,3) at previous turn, moved right to (4,3), so direction is R.\n> \n> Possible moves: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), L (left, x-1), R (right, x+1).\n> \n> But cannot move opposite to current direction immediately.

Positions: x from 2 to 5, y from 3 to 6, but (4,4) not in list, so yes, free.\n> \n> Similarly, down: (4,2) - y=2, not in positions, and not wall? Walls are borders, y=0 and y=7, so y=2 is playable. x=4, y=2 should be free.\n> \n> Left: (3,3) - but that's the body segment, occupied.\n> \n> Right: (5,3) - (5,3) is the tail? Positions: tail is (5,3), but at this turn, (5,3) is occupied by the tail.\n> \n> Now, moving to a body segment is deadly, except for the tail, because when you move, the tail also moves, so if head moves to where tail is, and tail moves away, it might be ok, but only if it's the tail and you're not eating food or something. Let's see the rules.\n> \n> \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, moving to the tail cell is safe, because the tail moves, so no collision.\n> \n> In this case, right to (5,3) is the tail, so moving R to (5,3) should be safe.\n> \n> Similarly, up to (4,4) is free, down to (4,2) is free.\n> \n> Left to (3,3) is body segment, not tail, so collision if move there.\n> \n> (3,3) is the second segment, not tail, so moving L would cause collision.\n> \n> So possible moves from (4,3): U, D, R.\n> \n> R to (5,3) is tail, safe.\n> \n> Now, food: (6,3) is to the right, at (6,3). From (4,3), R to (5,3), then if move R again to (6,3), but (6,3) is food.\n> \n> But (6,3) has x=6, but walls: border cells x=7 or x=0? x=7 is wall, but x=6 is not border, I think. Borders are x=0 and x=7, so x=6 is playable.\n> \n> x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x=1 to x=6 are playable? x=0 and x=7 are walls, so cells with x=0 or x=7 are walls. x=6 is not 0 or 7, so it's free, unless internal obstacle, but no, only (1,6) is internal obstacle.\n> \n> So (6,3) is a valid cell.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,5) is food under body.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> First, let's consider the food at (6,3) which disappears soon, life span 4, so only available until turn 34.\n> \n> Turn 31: countdown 4\n> \n> Turn 32: countdown 3\n> \n> Turn 33: countdown 2\n> \n> Turn 34: countdown 1\n> \n> Turn 35: disappears\n> \n> So we have until turn 34 to eat it.\n> \n> But to eat it, we need to be at (6,3) with head.\n> \n> Currently at (4,3), so we can go right: to (5,3) on turn 31, then to (6,3) on turn 32.\n> \n> But (5,3) is currently tail.

Let's think.\n> \n> At turn 31 start: positions: seg0: (4,3), seg1: (3,3), seg2: (3,4), seg3: (2,4), seg4: (2,5), seg5: (3,5), seg6: (3,6), seg7: (4,6), seg8: (4,5), seg9: (5,5), seg10: (5,4), seg11: (5,3)\n> \n> Now, if we move head R to (5,3).

It's turn 32. The grid has walls at the borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. There's also an internal obstacle at (1,6). So the grid is 8x8 from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls block those cells.\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (5,3), and the body segments follow: (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4). Let me list them in order:\n> \n> - Head: (5,3)\n> \n> - Then: (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4)\n> \n> That's 12 segments, so the snake length is 12.\n> \n> Head direction is R, which is right, so moving towards increasing x.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (6,3) with life span 3 and value 1 (positive food)\n> \n> - (2,5) with life span 9 and value 1 (positive food)\n> \n> Both are positive food, no negative food mentioned.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan an action sequence for at least 5 turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks. I should think about the immediate moves and potential future paths.\n> \n> First, let's visualize the grid. I'll sketch a small grid.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n> \n> Walls: all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 cells are walls. Also, internal obstacle at (1,6).\n> \n> Snake positions:\n> \n> - (5,3) head\n> \n> - (4,3)\n> \n> - (3,3)\n> \n> - (3,4)\n> \n> - (2,4)\n> \n> - (2,5) — this is also a food position? Food is at (2,5), and snake has a segment at (2,5). According to the rules, food can spawn under the body, but it can only be eaten if the body moves away and then head moves onto it.\n> \n> Similarly, for (6,3), which is adjacent to head.\n> \n> Current head at (5,3), direction R. Possible moves: since direction is R, I can go R (right to (6,3)), U (up to (5,4)), or D (down to (5,2)). Cannot go L (left to (4,3)) because that's opposite direction, instant reverse not allowed.\n> \n> Rule: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\" So current direction R, so cannot go L.\n> \n> So possible actions: U, D, R.\n> \n> Now, (6,3) has food with life span 3. Since it's turn 32, and life span decreases each turn, including current, so at turn 32, life span is 3, meaning it will disappear after 3 turns? Let me read carefully.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So for food at (6,3), life span 3 at turn 32. That means:\n> \n> - Turn 32: life span 3\n> \n> - Turn 33: life span 2\n> \n> - Turn 34: life span 1\n> \n> - Turn 35: life span 0, disappears at the end of turn 35 or beginning of turn 36? I think it disappears after N turns, so if it appears at turn T, it lasts until turn T + N - 1 or something. Need to clarify.\n> \n> Typically in such games, when countdown decreases every turn including current, if life span is N at turn t, it will be gone at the start of turn t + N or something.\n> \n> Let's think: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So at turn t, when we have the state, life span is L, then after the turn, it decreases to L-1, and when L-1=0, it disappears before next turn.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> I think it's better to assume that at the start of turn, if life span is L, after the turn, it becomes L-1, and if L-1=0, it disappears before the next turn.\n> \n> But for the purpose of eating, during the turn, if head moves to the food cell, it can be eaten as long as life span >0 when the move is made.\n> \n> Similarly, in the state, life span is given for the current turn.\n> \n> For (6,3), life span 3 at turn 32. So:\n> \n> - Turn 32: can be eaten, life span 3\n> \n> - After turn 32, life span becomes 2 for turn 33\n> \n> - Turn 33: can be eaten, life span 2\n> \n> - After turn 33, life span 1 for turn 34\n> \n> - Turn 34: can be eaten, life span 1\n> \n> - After turn 34, life span 0, disappears, so not available on turn 35.\n> \n> Similarly for (2,5), life span 9 at turn 32, so it will last until turn 32 + 9 - 1 = turn 40? Let's not worry, it has long life.\n> \n> Now, back to possible moves from (5,3):\n> \n> - R to (6,3): this cell has food. If I move here, I eat the food, snake grows by one, so new head at (6,3), and tail doesn't move? No, when you eat food, the snake grows, so the tail stays in place for that turn.\n> \n> Standard snake: when you eat food, you move to the food cell, and the tail doesn't advance, so snake length increases by one.\n> \n> But here, \"Length of snake +1\" for positive food.\n> \n> Also, collision: if head moves to a cell with body, it dies, except if it's the tail cell, because tail will move.\n> \n> Rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So moving to tail is safe because tail moves away.\n> \n> Now, current positions: head at (5,3), body segments: (4,3), (3,3), etc., and tail at (5,4)? Snake positions: [(5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4)]\n> \n> So tail is at (5,4).\n> \n> If I move R to (6,3), what is there? (6,3) is a food cell, not occupied by snake body. Let's see the snake positions: (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4). None of these are (6,3), so (6,3) is empty except for food. So moving to (6,3) should be safe, and I eat the food, so snake grows: new head at (6,3), body includes the old head (5,3), and the tail stays? When you eat, you add a segment, so after moving to (6,3), the snake becomes: head (6,3), then (5,3), (4,3), ..., up to tail (5,4), and since you ate, the tail doesn't move, so the new tail is still (5,4), and length increases to 13.\n> \n> But (5,4) is the current tail, and it will be the last segment.\n> \n> Now, after this move, the head direction would be R.\n> \n> But let's not get ahead; we need to think multiple turns.\n> \n> First, is moving to (6,3) safe? (6,3) is within bounds? x=6, y=3, x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7, but x=7 is wall, so (6,3) is not wall, since border walls are x=0 and x=7, so x=6 is fine, y=3 fine. No internal obstacle there. So yes, moving to (6,3) seems possible and I get +1 score.\n> \n> But I need to think long-term. Also, there's a risk: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake.\n> \n> In this case, for (6,3), it's not on the tail, so no issue.\n> \n> The tail is at (5,4), head at (5,3), so adjacent? (5,3) and (5,4) are adjacent vertically, but head is at (5,3), tail at (5,4), so they are adjacent, but the food is at (6,3), not on tail. Tail Reward Danger only applies if the food is on the tail cell itself and head is adjacent to it.\n> \n> Rule: \"If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake\"\n> \n> Here, tail is at (5,4), which has no food; food is at (2,5) and (6,3). (2,5) is actually occupied by snake body, as per positions: (2,5) is the sixth segment? Positions: index 0: (5,3) head, 1: (4,3), 2: (3,3), 3: (3,4), 4: (2,4), 5: (2,5), 6: (3,5), etc. So (2,5) is a body segment, and food is at (2,5), so food is under the body.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,3) is free.\n> \n> For (6,3), moving there is fine.\n> \n> But let's consider other moves.\n> \n> Option U: up to (5,4). What is at (5,4)? Current tail is at (5,4). If I move to (5,4), which is the tail, since tail will move, it should be safe. But is there food? (5,4) has no food listed; food is only at (6,3) and (2,5). So moving to (5,4) is safe, but no food eaten, snake moves, tail advances, so length same.\n> \n> Option D: down to (5,2). (5,2) is empty? No snake or wall? Walls: x=0,7 y=0,7, (1,6) obstacle. (5,2) should be free. Moving there is safe, no food.\n> \n> Now, if I move R to (6,3), I eat food, grow to 13, head at (6,3), direction R.\n> \n> Then from there, possible moves: U to (6,4), D to (6,2), R to (7,3) but x=7 is wall, so cannot. L to (5,3) but (5,3) is now the second segment? After moving to (6,3), snake: head (6,3), then (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4) tail.\n> \n> (5,3) is the neck, so if I go L to (5,3), that would be moving back, but (5,3) is occupied by body, and since it's not the tail, it would cause collision. Tail is at (5,4), so (5,3) is body, not tail. Moving to (5,3) from (6,3) would be suicide.\n> \n> From (6,3), possible moves:\n> \n> - U to (6,4): check if free. (6,4) not in snake positions? Current positions after move: head (6,3), body (5,3), (4,3), ..., (5,4) tail. (6,4) not listed, so should be free. Also not wall, y=4 <7.\n> \n> - D to (6,2): similarly, should be free.\n> \n> - R to (7,3): x=7 wall, cannot.\n> \n> - L to (5,3): but (5,3) is body segment, collision.\n> \n> So from (6,3), only U or D possible.\n> \n> But I need to think beyond immediate.\n> \n> Now, the other food is at (2,5), which is currently occupied by snake body. To eat it, the body must move away, then head moves there.\n> \n> Currently, (2,5) is the position of the 5th segment? Positions: index 0: (5,3) head, 1: (4,3), 2: (3,3), 3: (3,4), 4: (2,4), 5: (2,5), 6: (3,5), etc.\n> \n> So segment at index 5 is (2,5), which has food under it. Life span 9, so plenty of time.\n> \n> To eat this, the snake must move so that the segment at (2,5) moves away, freeing the cell, and then later head moves to (2,5) when it's empty.\n> \n> But head is far away at (5,3), so it might take several turns.\n> \n> Also, the snake is long, 12 segments, so it's a bit cramped.\n> \n> Grid is 8x8 with walls, so 64 cells, minus walls: border walls occupy cells, but since x=0,7 and y=0,7 are walls, that's 2*8 + 2*8 - 4 corners = 16 + 16 - 4 = 28 wall cells? No: for a grid from (0,0) to (7,7), cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. Number of such cells: top and bottom rows: 8 cells each, left and right columns but corners shared, so 2*8 + 2*8 - 4 = 16+16-4=28 wall cells, but internal cells are from (1,1) to (6,6), 6x6=36 cells, minus internal obstacle at (1,6), so 35 free cells?

But since I didn't eat on turn 33, tail moves, so the last segment (5,4) is removed, so snake: head (6,4), then (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5) and tail at (5,5)? Let's trace.\n> \n> After turn 32: ate food at (6,3), so snake grows: positions: head (6,3), then previous segments: (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4) — so 13 segments, tail at (5,4).\n> \n> Turn 33: move U to (6,4). (6,4) is free, no food, so no eat, just move.

Segment 5 is at (2,4), and it will move to where segment 4 moves from, etc.\n> \n> After a move:\n> \n> - Head moves to new cell.\n> \n> - Segment 1 (index 1) moves to old position of head (6,3)\n> \n> - Segment 2 moves to old position of segment 1 (5,3)\n> \n> - Segment 3 moves to old position of segment 2 (4,3)\n> \n> - Segment 4 moves to old position of segment 3 (3,3)\n> \n> - Segment 5 moves to old position of segment 4 (3,4)\n> \n> - Segment 6 moves to old position of segment 5 (2,4)\n> \n> - Segment 7 moves to old position of segment 6 (2,5)\n> \n> - Segment 8 moves to old position of segment 7 (3,5)\n> \n> - And so on.\n> \n> Old position of segment 6 is (2,5), which is vacated only if the tail moves, but segment 6 is not tail; tail is segment 12.\n> \n> After move, if no food eaten:\n> \n> - New head position\n> \n> - Body segments: segment i moves to position of segment i-1 for i from 1 to 12, but since head is new, it's a bit different.\n> \n> The list of positions: after moving without eating, the new list is:\n> \n> [new_head, old_head, old_seg1, old_seg2, ..., old_seg11]\n> \n> The tail, old_seg12, is removed.\n> \n> For example, if snake moves right, but we can't because wall, so let's take U or D.\n> \n> Suppose at turn 33, we move U to (6,4)\n> \n> Then new head: (6,4)\n> \n> Then body:\n> \n> - Segment 1 (was (5,3)) moves to old head position (6,3)\n> \n> - Segment 2 (was (4,3)) moves to old seg1 position (5,3)\n> \n> - Segment 3 (was (3,3)) moves to old seg2 position (4,3)\n> \n> - Segment 4 (was (3,4)) moves to old seg3 position (3,3)\n> \n> - Segment 5 (was (2,4)) moves to old seg4 position (3,4)\n> \n> - Segment 6 (was (2,5)) moves to old seg5 position (2,4)\n> \n> - Segment 7 (was (3,5)) moves to old seg6 position (2,5)\n> \n> - Segment 8 (was (3,6)) moves to old seg7 position (3,5)\n> \n> - Segment 9 (was (4,6)) moves to old seg8 position (3,6)\n> \n> - Segment 10 (was (4,5)) moves to old seg9 position (4,6)\n> \n> - Segment 11 (was (5,5)) moves to old seg10 position (4,5)\n> \n> - Segment 12 (was (5,4)) moves to old seg11 position (5,5)\n> \n> And the old seg12 position (5,4) is vacated.\n> \n> Now, the food is at (2,5). After this move, segment 7 moves to old seg6 position, which is (2,5). Old seg6 was at (2,5), so segment 7 moves to (2,5), so (2,5) is still occupied by segment 7 now.\n> \n> Initially, segment 6 was at (2,5), after move, segment 7 moves to (2,5), so (2,5) remains occupied.\n> \n> Similarly, if we move D or other, it might take several moves for (2,5) to be vacated.\n> \n> The food at (2,5) is under the body, and as the snake moves, different segments may occupy it until the tail passes over it.\n> \n> To eat the food, we need the head to move to (2,5) when it is not occupied by any body segment.\n> \n> So, we need to free (2,5) first.\n> \n> Currently, at turn 33, (2,5) is occupied by segment 6.\n> \n> The tail is at (5,4), which is segment 12.\n> \n> The snake has 13 segments.\n> \n> When the snake moves, the position (2,5) will be occupied by the next segment in line, until the tail moves away.\n> \n> Specifically, the segment that is at a position where it will be the last to leave (2,5) as the snake moves.\n> \n> Since the snake is moving, the body segments shift positions.\n> \n> The cell (2,5) will be freed when the segment that was occupying it moves to a new position and no other segment moves to it immediately, but because of the shift, when the tail passes over it.\n> \n> Let's think about the order.\n> \n> The food at (2,5) can be eaten only after it is vacated and before life span ends.\n> \n> Life span 8 at turn 33, so it decreases by 1 each turn, so at turn 33, life=8; turn 34, life=7; ... turn 40, life=1; after turn 40, it disappears, so it can be eaten up to turn 40.\n> \n> Now, to free (2,5), we need the snake to move such that the segment at (2,5) moves away and no segment replaces it immediately.\n> \n> In the current configuration, (2,5) is occupied by segment 6. Segment 6 is the 7th segment from head? Head is segment 0, so segment 6 is the 7th position.\n> \n> When the snake moves, segment 6 moves to the position of segment 5, which is (2,4). Then segment 7 moves to the old position of segment 6, which is (2,5). So (2,5) is now occupied by segment 7.\n> \n> Similarly, on the next move, segment 7 moves to where segment 6 was, which is now (2,4) or whatever, and segment 8 moves to (2,5), and so on.\n> \n> (2,5) will be occupied until the tail segment moves away from it.\n> \n> The tail is at (5,4), which is far away.\n> \n> The position (2,5) is part of the body, and as the snake moves, the occupancy of (2,5) will change to the next segment each move, until the segment that is currently at (2,5) is no longer in the snake or something.\n> \n> Let's find which segment will be the last to occupy (2,5).\n> \n> The snake segments from head to tail: positions with indices.\n> \n> Segment at (2,5) is index 6 (0-based, head=0).\n> \n> When snake moves, each segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> So the cell (2,5) is occupied by segment k for some k.\n> \n> After a move, segment k moves to the position that segment k-1 was at before the move.\n> \n> Then segment k+1 moves to the position that segment k was at before the move, which is (2,5).\n> \n> So for each move, the segment that moves to (2,5) is the one that was previously at the position where segment k-1 was, but it's messy.\n> \n> The cell (2,5) will be occupied by consecutive segments as the snake moves, until the tail passes it.\n> \n> The distance from the head to the food segment.\n> \n> Head at (6,3), food at (2,5), Manhattan distance |6-2| + |3-5| = 4 + 2 = 6, so it's 6 segments away from head? Not exactly.\n> \n> The snake must move to advance the body.\n> \n> To free (2,5), the snake needs to move enough times so that the tail has passed (2,5).\n> \n> Currently, the tail is at (5,4), which is not near (2,5).\n> \n> The segment at (2,5) is part of the body, and when the snake moves, it will take several moves for (2,5) to be vacated.\n> \n> Specifically, since the snake has 13 segments, and (2,5) is occupied by segment 6, after 6 moves, segment 6 will be at a new position, but let's simulate.\n> \n> Assume we don't eat any food, so snake length stays the same.\n> \n> After one move, say we move U to (6,4), as before.\n> \n> New positions:\n> \n> Head: (6,4)\n> \n> Seg1: (6,3)  // old head\n> \n> Seg2: (5,3)  // old seg1\n> \n> Seg3: (4,3)  // old seg2\n> \n> Seg4: (3,3)  // old seg3\n> \n> Seg5: (3,4)  // old seg4  // old seg4 was (3,4), so seg5 moves to (3,4)?

It's turn 34. The grid has walls at the borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. There's also an internal obstacle at (1,6). So, the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), but with obstacles.\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (6,4), and the body segments follow: (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (5,5). Let me list them in order:\n> \n> - Head: (6,4)\n> \n> - Segment 1: (6,3)\n> \n> - Segment 2: (5,3)\n> \n> - Segment 3: (4,3)\n> \n> - Segment 4: (3,3)\n> \n> - Segment 5: (3,4)\n> \n> - Segment 6: (2,4)\n> \n> - Segment 7: (2,5)\n> \n> - Segment 8: (3,5)\n> \n> - Segment 9: (3,6)\n> \n> - Segment 10: (4,6)\n> \n> - Segment 11: (4,5)\n> \n> - Segment 12: (5,5)  // tail\n> \n> The snake has 13 segments? Let's count: positions from (6,4) to (5,5) is 13 positions. Indices: 0 to 12, so 13 segments.\n> \n> Snake head direction is Up, meaning it moved to (6,4) from below, since previous position would be (6,3) but (6,3) is the first body segment, so the head is at (6,4) and it's facing Up, so it came from (6,3).\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (2,5) with value 1 and life span 7\n> \n> - (4,1) with value 1 and life span 10\n> \n> Both are positive food, since value is +1.\n> \n> Life span: for (2,5), it disappears after 7 turns, including this turn, so it has 7 turns left starting from turn 34. After turn 34, it decreases to 6, then 5, etc., until turn 40 it disappears? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 34, life span is 7, meaning it will disappear after 7 turns, so at turn 41 it's gone. Let's clarify: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So on turn 34, life span is 7; after turn 34, it becomes 6; turn 35, it becomes 5; ... turn 40, it becomes 1; turn 41, it becomes 0 and disappears. Similarly for (4,1), life span 10, disappears after turn 43.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan an action sequence for the next 5+ turns. Since it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", I should plan for at least 5 turns, but probably more to ensure survival.\n> \n> First, let's map out the grid. Grid size: walls at x=0,7 and y=0,7, so cells from (1,1) to (6,6) are playable, except internal obstacle at (1,6).\n> \n> Internal obstacle: (1,6), so that cell is blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions: let's plot this to visualize.\n> \n> I'll make a small grid. Rows y from 0 to 7, but y=0 and y=7 are walls, similarly x=0 and x=7 walls. So playable: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6.\n> \n> y=1 bottom, y=6 top? Usually in grids, y increases upwards, but in coordinates, it might be different. In the state, head direction is U, which is (x,y+1), so y increases upwards, I think.

Tail at (5,5).\n> \n> Now, food at (2,5). But (2,5) is occupied by the snake? Snake positions include (2,5), which is segment 7: (2,5).\n> \n> Food is at (2,5), but snake is also at (2,5)?

No (4,1), so (4,1) is empty.\n> \n> (2,5) is occupied by snake segment, so food is there but under the body.\n> \n> To eat it, the snake must move so that segment moves away, then head can move to (2,5) when it's free.\n> \n> But currently, head is at (6,4), far away.\n> \n> Now, head direction is U, so from (6,4), possible moves: U, D, L, R, but with no instant reverse.

That segment is part of the body. When the snake moves, the tail will move, but since it's not the tail, it might not move immediately.\n> \n> The tail is at (5,5). Segment at (2,5) is fixed until the snake moves and the body shifts.\n> \n> To free up (2,5), the snake needs to move such that the segment leaves (2,5), which happens when the snake moves forward and the body follows.\n> \n> Since (2,5) is a body segment, not tail, when snake moves, the segment at (2,5) will move to the next position only if it's not the tail, but in snake movement, when head moves, all body segments shift forward, so the segment that was at (2,5) will move to where the previous segment was, but it's a chain.\n> \n> Standard snake: when head moves to a new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment. So the cell that was occupied by the tail is vacated, unless food is eaten.\n> \n> But here, since no food is eaten, when snake moves, the tail moves, so the cell (5,5) is vacated, and all segments shift: head to new position, segment 1 to old head position, and so on, down to tail moving to position of segment 11 or something.\n> \n> Let's simulate one move.\n> \n> Current positions: index 0: (6,4) head, index 1: (6,3), index 2: (5,3), ..., up to index 12: (5,5) tail.\n> \n> If head moves to a new position, say (6,5), then new positions: head at (6,5), index 1 at (6,4) (old head), index 2 at (6,3) (old index 1), index 3 at (5,3) (old index 2), and so on, until index 12 at (4,5)? Old index 11 is (4,5), so tail moves to (4,5), and (5,5) is vacated.\n> \n> Similarly, if head moves left to (5,4), new head (5,4), index 1 at (6,4), index 2 at (6,3), etc., tail at (4,5) or something.\n> \n> But for (2,5), it's index 7. When snake moves, index 7 will move to where index 6 was, which is (2,4), since index 6 is (2,4). Current index 6 is (2,4), index 7 is (2,5), so if head moves, index 7 will move to (2,4), so (2,5) is vacated? Not necessarily vacated, but the segment leaves (2,5) only if the body shifts.\n> \n> In the shift, the cell (2,5) is no longer occupied because the segment moves to (2,4), but (2,4) was occupied by index 6, who moves to where index 5 was, etc.\n> \n> After one move, the cell that was occupied by the tail is free, and other cells might change.\n> \n> Specifically for (2,5): current position index 7 at (2,5).\n> \n> After head moves (say to (6,5)), new positions: head (6,5), index 1 at (6,4), index 2 at (6,3), index 3 at (5,3), ..., let's trace.\n> \n> Better to list positions after move.\n> \n> Assume head moves U to (6,5).\n> \n> Then new snake:\n> \n> - Head: (6,5)\n> \n> - Index 1: (6,4)  // old head\n> \n> - Index 2: (6,3)  // old index 1\n> \n> - Index 3: (5,3)  // old index 2\n> \n> - Index 4: (4,3)  // old index 3\n> \n> - Index 5: (3,3)  // old index 4\n> \n> - Index 6: (3,4)  // old index 5\n> \n> - Index 7: (2,4)  // old index 6, which was (2,4)?

But according to the rules, food can spawn under the snake's body, but it can only be eaten if the body moves away and the head moves onto it. So currently, (2,5) has food under it, but since it's not the head, it can't be eaten yet. The snake needs to move so that this cell is vacated, then later the head can come to eat it.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,1) is free, I think.

So current direction is L, meaning it came from right, so it was at (6,4) before moving to (5,4)? Positions: head (5,4), then (6,4), which is the previous head position.\n> \n> Since head direction is L, it moved left to (5,4), so from (6,4) to (5,4).\n> \n> Now, possible moves: since it just moved left, it cannot instantly reverse to right, so R is not allowed.

Walls: y=7 is wall, but (5,5) is y=5, not wall. Internal obstacles: (1,6), not here. So (5,5) should be empty? But there might be food? Food is at (2,5) and (4,1), so (5,5) no food. So it should be safe to move to, as long as not wall or body.\n> \n> Snake positions: (5,4) is head, but moving to (5,5), which is not occupied by any body part, I think. Let's list all positions: (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5). So (5,5) not listed, so free.\n> \n> - Move D to (5,3): (5,3) is a body segment, the 4th position: (5,3). So if head moves to (5,3), it would collide with the body segment there, since it's not the tail? Tail is at (4,5).\n> \n> Important: body collision except when moving into the tail cell, because the tail will move.\n> \n> Rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment).

If it moves to the tail cell, it's ok because tail moves.\n> \n> Here, (5,3) is occupied by the 4th segment, which is not the tail. Tail is (4,5). So moving to (5,3) would cause collision, death.\n> \n> Therefore, D to (5,3) is not safe.\n> \n> - Move L to (4,4): what is there? (4,4) not in snake positions? Snake has (4,3), (4,5), (4,6), but not (4,4)? (4,4) is missing from the list. Positions: (4,3), then (3,3), so (4,4) not there. Also not wall, since walls are borders. So (4,4) should be empty.\n> \n> Food? (4,1) is food, not (4,4). So (4,4) is free and safe.\n> \n> - Move R: but R is opposite to current direction L, so not allowed. Cannot move right.\n> \n> So for turn 35, possible moves: U to (5,5) or L to (4,4). D is invalid because of body.\n> \n> Now, I need to think ahead 5+ turns.\n> \n> Also, there is food at (2,5) which is currently occupied by the snake body at segment (2,5). So to eat that, the snake needs to move so that (2,5) is vacated, then head can go there.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (4,1) is free, but far away.\n> \n> Life span: food at (2,5) has life span 6, so after turn 35, it has 5 turns left: it will disappear after turn 35 + 6 - 1? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 35, it has life_span=6, meaning it will disappear after 6 turns, so it can be eaten until turn 40 (since turn 35: countdown 6, turn 36:5, turn 37:4, turn 38:3, turn 39:2, turn 40:1, turn 41: gone?

The tail is at (4,5), which is the last segment.\n> \n> To vacate (2,5), the snake needs to move so that the segment at (2,5) moves away. But since the snake moves by the head moving and tail moving, when the head moves, the tail also moves forward, so cells are vacated.\n> \n> Specifically, when the snake moves, the head goes to a new cell, each segment moves to the next position, and the tail cell is vacated.\n> \n> But in this case, (2,5) is not the tail; it's an intermediate segment.

It's turn 36, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid is from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are at the borders, meaning I can't go to those cells. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (1,6).\n> \n> Snake positions: Head is at (4,4), and the body segments follow: (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6). That's 13 segments, so the snake is 13 units long.\n> \n> Head direction is L, which is left, so moving left. Last move was left to (4,4) from (5,4), I think. Positions are listed head first, so from (4,4) to (5,4) to (6,4), etc. So the head is at (4,4), and it was moving left to get there from (5,4).\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (2,5) with value 1 and life span 5. So it disappears after 5 turns, including this turn? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so if life span is 5 at turn 36, it will disappear after turn 40? Let me confirm.\n> \n> Life span decreases every turn, including the current turn. So at turn t, if life span is N, it will last until turn t + N - 1, and disappear at turn t + N. For example, at turn 36, life span 5 means:\n> \n> - Turn 36: life span 5\n> \n> - Turn 37: life span 4\n> \n> - Turn 38: life span 3\n> \n> - Turn 39: life span 2\n> \n> - Turn 40: life span 1\n> \n> - Turn 41: it disappears. So it can be eaten from turn 36 to 40 inclusive? No.\n> \n> If at turn t, life span is L, then after this turn, life span becomes L-1, and so on, until it reaches 0, and then it disappears. So the food is present as long as life span > 0.\n> \n> So for food at (2,5) with life span 5 at turn 36:\n> \n> - Available on turns: 36, 37, 38, 39, 40 (since after turn 40, life span would be 0, so gone at turn 41).\n> \n> Similarly, food at (4,1) with life span 8 at turn 36:\n> \n> - Available from turn 36 to 36+7=43? Turn 36: life span 8, so after 8 decrements, it disappears at turn 36 + 8 = 44? Let's think:\n> \n> - Start of turn 36: life span 8, food present.\n> \n> - After turn 36, life span decreases to 7.\n> \n> - After turn 37, to 6, and so on.\n> \n> - After turn 43, life span decreases to 0, so food disappears at the start of turn 44.\n> \n> Therefore, food is available from turn t to turn t + life_span - 1 inclusive.\n> \n> For (2,5): life span 5 at turn 36, available turns 36 to 40.\n> \n> For (4,1): life span 8 at turn 36, available turns 36 to 43.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks. Prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> First, let's map out the grid. Walls at borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are all walls, so the playable area is x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? No.\n> \n> Border cells: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. So for x, 0 and 7 are walls, so x=1 to 6 are playable? x=0 and x=7 are walls, so columns x=0 and x=7 are walls, but rows y=0 to y=7 at x=0 and x=7 are walls. Similarly for y=0 and y=7.\n> \n> The grid has cells from (0,0) to (7,7), but cells where x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. Also, internal obstacle at (1,6).\n> \n> So playable cells are where 1≤x≤6 and 1≤y≤6, except for walls at borders and internal obstacles.\n> \n> x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, so for example, cell (0,1) is wall, (1,0) is wall, etc. Playable cells are x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except internal obstacles.\n> \n> Internal obstacle: (1,6), so (1,6) is blocked.\n> \n> Now, snake positions: let's list them in order:\n> \n> Head: (4,4)\n> \n> Then: (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6)\n> \n> That's 13 segments.

But since the snake will move, we need to see where the body will be after move.\n> \n> When I move, the head moves to a new position, and the tail moves forward, so body segments shift.\n> \n> So to check collision, after moving, the head should not collide with the body except the tail cell might be ok if tail moves.\n> \n> Specifically, after moving, the head is at new position, and the body is the old positions minus the tail, but with head added.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, the tail is removed unless food is eaten.\n> \n> If no food eaten, head moves to new cell, tail is removed, so body shifts.\n> \n> If food eaten, head moves to food, tail not removed, so snake grows by one.\n> \n> Now, for collision: after move, if head position is same as any body segment (except the tail, if tail is moving away), but since tail moves, the cell that was tail becomes empty, so head can move to where tail was, but only if it's the only segment there.\n> \n> In this case, when head moves to a cell, if that cell is occupied by any body segment except the current tail, it's collision. If it's the tail cell, it might be ok because tail moves away simultaneously.\n> \n> But in terms of grid state after move: the new head position should not be in the set of body segments that remain after tail moves.\n> \n> Easier to simulate the move.\n> \n> Let's list all current snake positions: [(4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (3,6), (4,6)]\n> \n> If I move to a direction, say to cell C.\n> \n> Then, if C has no food, new head is at C, new body is [C] + positions[:-1] so all except the last (tail).\n> \n> Then if C is in the old body positions except the tail, it collides.\n> \n> If C has food, new head at C, new body is [C] + positions, so all positions plus new head, so length increases, and tail stays.\n> \n> Collision if C is in old positions except possibly tail.\n> \n> But if C is the tail position, and no food, then after move, tail moves away, so C is empty before head moves?

But in this case, head and tail are at same position after eating, but since it's the same cell, it might be considered collision or not? The rules don't specify, but typically in snake, eating food at tail position might be allowed if tail moves away, but here the rule says \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because head and newly grown tail collide.\n> \n> Let's read carefully.\n> \n> \" **Tail Reward Danger**: If the head is *adjacent to the tail* and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n> \n> So this is specific to when head is adjacent to tail, and tail has food, and head moves to eat it.\n> \n> In general, for other cases, moving to tail position might be safe if no food or something.\n> \n> But let's first list possible moves from current position.\n> \n> Current head (4,4), direction L.\n> \n> Possible actions: U, D, L (since R is reverse, not allowed).\n> \n> Move L to (3,4): (3,4) is currently occupied by segment 7.

Walls: borders x=0,7 y=0,7; internal (1,6). (4,6) is not (1,6), so no wall. Snake positions: head (4,5), tail (3,6), etc., no (4,6), so empty. So (4,6) is safe.\n> \n> (3,5) is occupied, so not safe unless it's tail, but it's not.\n> \n> Tail is (3,6), so if I move to (3,6), that might be safe, but (3,6) is tail, so moving to (3,6) could be safe because tail moves.\n> \n> But from (4,5), (3,6) is not adjacent; adjacent are (4,6), (4,4), (3,5), (5,5). (3,6) is diagonal, not adjacent, so I can only move to orthogonal cells.\n> \n> So only possible safe moves: U to (4,6) or R to (5,5).\n> \n> Cannot move L to (3,5) because body collision.\n> \n> Cannot move D, reverse not allowed.\n> \n> So choices: U or R.\n> \n> Now, I need to think about food and long-term.\n> \n> Food at (2,5), (4,1), (2,4)\n> \n> (2,5) has food but it's under body segment 10.

So new seg12 is the old seg11.\n> \n> Specifically, after move, new head, then old seg0, old seg1, ..., old seg11.\n> \n> So old seg10 becomes new seg11, old seg11 becomes new seg12 (tail).\n> \n> After another move, old seg10 becomes new seg11, then after second move, it becomes new seg12? Let's index.\n> \n> After first move (no eat): positions: new head, then old seg0, old seg1, ..., old seg11. So the body has 12 segments, tail is old seg11.\n> \n> Old seg10 is now the 11th segment (since new seg1 is old seg0, new seg2 is old seg1, ..., new seg11 is old seg10, new seg12 is old seg11).\n> \n> New positions: index 0: new head\n> \n> Index 1: old seg0\n> \n> Index 2: old seg1\n> \n> ...\n> \n> Index 12: old seg11\n> \n> And old seg12 is gone.\n> \n> So for old seg10, it is now at new index 11 (since new index k corresponds to old seg(k-1) for k=1 to 12).\n> \n> After first move, the segment that was at old seg10 position is now at new index 11.\n> \n> After second move without eating, new head, then new index 1: previous new seg0 (which was new head), but let's not confuse.\n> \n> After first move, let's say the snake has positions Q0, Q1, ..., Q12 where Q0 new head, Q1 = old P0, Q2 = old P1, ..., Q12 = old P11.\n> \n> So the position that was old P10 is now occupied by Q11.\n> \n> After second move without eating, new head R0, then R1 = Q0, R2 = Q1, R3 = Q2, ..., R12 = Q11.\n> \n> So the position that was Q11 is now R12, the tail.\n> \n> But Q11 is the position of old P11, not old P10.\n> \n> I'm interested in the segment that was at (2,5), which is old P10.\n> \n> After first move, that segment is at Q11 position, which is the position it moved to, but in terms of the cell, the cell (2,5) is now occupied by Q11, which is old P11, not the same segment.\n> \n> The segment that was at (2,5) is now at a new position.\n> \n> Specifically, after first move, the segment that was at P10 is now at the position that was P9, because when the snake moves, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> For example, from P positions, after head move, the segment that was at P1 moves to P0 position, but P0 is the head position, which is new.\n> \n> The segment that was at Pk moves to the position of P(k-1) for k=1 to 12, but P0 is replaced by new head.\n> \n> So the segment at P10 moves to P9 position.\n> \n> Similarly, the segment at P11 moves to P10 position, and the segment at P12 (tail) is removed.\n> \n> In this case, for cell (2,5), it was occupied by P10 segment. After move, that segment moves to P9 position, which is (2,4), so (2,5) is now occupied by the segment that was at P11, which is (3,5), so (2,5) is now occupied by a different segment, not freed.\n> \n> Similarly, the cell is only freed if it was the tail position.\n> \n> Otherwise, body cells are always occupied unless the tail was there and moves.\n> \n> To free (2,5), I need the tail to be at (2,5) and then move away.\n> \n> Currently, (2,5) is occupied by seg10, and tail is at (3,6).\n> \n> The distance: seg10 to tail is two segments away (seg11 and seg12), so after two moves without eating, seg10 will be the tail.\n> \n> After first move no eat, new tail is old seg11.\n> \n> After second move no eat, new tail is old seg10.\n> \n> Then when the snake moves again, if no eat, the tail (old seg10) moves away, freeing (2,5).\n> \n> But when it moves, it may not be at (2,5) anymore.\n> \n> Let's simulate.\n> \n> Current: P10 at (2,5)\n> \n> After first move no eat: the segment that was P10 is now at P9 position, which is (2,4), and the new position at (2,5) is occupied by the segment that was P11, at (3,5), so (2,5) has the segment from (3,5) now.\n> \n> After second move no eat: the segment that was P10 is now at P8 position or something.\n> \n> It's messy.\n> \n> The cell (2,5) will be free only when the tail is at (2,5) and the snake moves without eating, so the tail is removed.\n> \n> Currently, tail is at (3,6), not at (2,5).\n> \n> To get the tail to (2,5), I need to move the snake so that the segment at (2,5) becomes the tail.\n> \n> Since it's seg10 now, and there are 13 segments, after 3 moves without eating, the current seg10 will be the tail, because each move reduces the tail index.\n> \n> Start with 13 segments, indices 0 to 12.\n> \n> After one move no eat, 12 segments, indices 0 to 11, where new 0 is new head, new 1 is old 0, new 2 is old 1, ..., new 11 is old 10, and old 11 and 12 are gone? No.\n> \n> After move, new segments: new head, then old 0 to old 11 as new 1 to new 12? Let's define.\n> \n> Before move: segments S0, S1, S2, ..., S12 with positions.\n> \n> After move to new head position, new segments: T0 = new position, T1 = S0 position, T2 = S1 position, ..., T12 = S11 position.\n> \n> So the number of segments is the same if no growth, but the tail S12 is removed, so new snake has positions T0 to T12, but T12 is at S11 position, so the segment S11 is now at T12 position.\n> \n> The segment that was S10 is now at T11 position, which is S9 position.\n> \n> The position of S10 is now occupied by T11, which is the segment that was S11.\n> \n> So the cell (2,5) remains occupied.\n> \n> After k moves without eating, the segment that was S10 will be at a new position, and the cell (2,5) will be occupied by a different segment until the tail reaches it.\n> \n> The cell (2,5) will be free only when the tail is at that cell and the snake moves without eating.\n> \n> To have the tail at (2,5), since currently S10 is at (2,5), S10 will become the tail after 3 moves without eating, because after 3 moves, the new tail will be the segment that was S9, but let's calculate.\n> \n> After 0 moves: tail is S12 at (3,6)\n> \n> After 1 move no eat: new tail is S11 at (3,5)\n> \n> After 2 moves no eat: new tail is S10 at (2,5)  because after first move, new tail is S11, after second move, new tail is the previous new S11, which was S10.\n> \n> After first move: new snake: T0 new head, T1 = S0, T2 = S1, ..., T12 = S11, so tail T12 = S11 at position of S11.\n> \n> After second move no eat: U0 new head, U1 = T0, U2 = T1, ..., U12 = T11, so tail U12 = T11 = S10 at position of S10, which is (2,5).\n> \n> Then, after second move, tail is at (2,5).\n> \n> Then on the third move, if no food eaten, the snake moves, new head, and tail is removed, so (2,5) is vacated.\n> \n> At that point, if head moves to (2,5), it can eat the food.\n> \n> But the food is at (2,5), and when the cell is vacated, the food is still there, so if head moves to it, it can eat.\n> \n> Similarly for other cells.\n> \n> For (2,5) food, it can be eaten when the snake moves such that on that turn, the tail was at (2,5) and moves away, and head moves to (2,5).\n> \n> But the head moving to (2,5) must be on the same turn that the tail leaves.\n> \n> In general, for a food under body, it can be eaten when the segment that was on it becomes the tail and the snake moves with head going to that cell.\n> \n> But it's a bit specific.\n> \n> In this case, for (2,5), to eat it, I need to have the tail at (2,5) and then on the next move, head moves to (2,5) while tail moves away.\n> \n> But the tail moving away happens when the snake moves.\n> \n> So on the turn when tail is at (2,5), if I move the head to (2,5), but that would cause collision because the tail is there, but since it's the tail, moving to tail cell is safe because the tail moves away simultaneously.\n> \n> Rule: you can move into the tail cell because the tail moves forward.\n> \n> So if tail is at (2,5), and head moves to (2,5), it is safe, and since food is there, it gets eaten, and snake grows, so tail doesn't move, new tail is added, so no collision.\n> \n> But there is a danger if head is adjacent to tail and tail has food, but here it's moving to tail.\n> \n> The tail reward danger is when head is adjacent to tail and the tail cell has food, eating it kills because after eating, the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move, and head is on the food, but the previous tail is still there, but since head moved to it, they are on the same cell, which is not possible, but in snake, when you eat, you grow, so head moves to food, and the tail doesn't move, so the new segment is added at the tail position.\n> \n> But if the head moves to the tail position to eat food, and tail is there, before move, head and tail are at different cells.\n> \n> Suppose tail is at F, which has food, and head is at H, adjacent to F.\n> \n> If head moves to F, then head moves to F, eats food, so snake grows, so the tail stays at F, but head is now at F, so they are on the same cell, which is collision.\n> \n> That's the tail reward danger.\n> \n> To avoid that, you should not eat food on the tail cell if head is adjacent to tail.\n> \n> Otherwise, if head is not adjacent, moving to tail cell is fine, as tail moves away.\n> \n> In this case for (2,5), to eat it safely, I need the tail to be at (2,5) and head not adjacent to it when I move to it.\n> \n> So first, I need to get the tail to (2,5).\n> \n> Currently, tail is at (3,6), and (2,5) is occupied by seg10.\n> \n> As above, after 2 moves without eating, the tail will be at (2,5).\n> \n> Then at that point, if head is not adjacent to (2,5), I can move to it.\n> \n> Currently at turn 37, head at (4,5), tail at (3,6).\n> \n> After

Total length is 13.\n- **Food**:\n  - (2,5): value +1, life span 2 (disappears after Turn 40).\n  - (4,1): value +1, life span 5 (disappears after Turn 43).\n  - (2,4): value +1, life span 8 (disappears after Turn 46).\n\n### Possible Moves at Turn 39\nFrom the head position (3,6) and current direction L, the possible moves are:\n- **L (Left)**: to (2,6)\n  - Check: (2,6) is not a wall or body segment (except tail, which moves).\n- **D (Down)**: to (3,5)\n  - Check: (3,5) is not a wall or body segment.\n- **U (Up)**: to (3,7)\n  - Invalid: y=7 is a wall.\n- **R (Right)**: to (4,6)\n  - Invalid: instant reverse from L to R is not allowed.\n\nSo, valid immediate moves are L to (2,6) or D to (3,5).\n\n### Evaluating Move L to (2,6)\n**Turn 39**: Move L to (2,6)\n- New head: (2,6)\n- Body shifts: (3,6) becomes first body segment, etc., tail (2,5) is removed.\n- Food at (2,5) is now free (was under tail).\n\n**Turn 40**: From (2,6), move D to (2,5) to eat the food.\n- New head: (2,5)\n- Snake grows: length becomes 14.\n- Tail remains at (2,4) (which has food).\n\n**Potential Issue**: After eating (2,5), head is at (2,5), tail at (2,4) with food. They are adjacent vertically. If we then try to eat (2,4), it would cause a collision (Tail Reward Danger).\n\n**Solution**: After eating (2,5), avoid eating (2,4) immediately. Instead, move away to (1,5) or (3,5).\n\n### Evaluating Move D to (3,5)\n**Turn 39**: Move D to (3,5)\n- New head: (3,5)\n- Body shifts: (3,6) becomes first body segment, etc., tail (2,5) is removed.\n- Food at (2,5) is now free.\n\n**Turn 40**: From (3,5), move L to (2,5) to eat the food.\n- New head: (2,5)\n- Snake grows: length becomes 14.\n- Tail remains at (2,4) with food.\n\n**Potential Issue**: Same as above—head at (2,5), tail at (2,4) with food, adjacent.\n\n**Solution**: After eating (2,5), move away to (1,5) or (2,6). However, moving to (2,6) leads to a dead end (no further moves possible).\n\n### Comparing Both Options\n- **Move L first**:\n  - Allows more flexibility after eating (2,5) (can move R to (3,5) then D to (3,4)).\n  - Avoids immediate dead ends.\n- **Move D first**:\n  - Leads to a dead end after eating (2,5) if moving to (2,6).\n  - Less flexible.\n\n### Decision\n**Turn 39**: Move L to (2,6) for better flexibility.\n\n**Subsequent Moves**:\n- **Turn 40**: D to (2,5) to eat the food.\n- **Turn 41**: R to (3,5) to avoid the tail collision risk.\n- **Turn 42**: D to (3,4) (safe move to tail position).\n- **Turn 43**: L to (2,4) to eat the food there (no immediate collision risk).\n\n### Final Answer\n\\boxed{L}",
        "state": "**Current Turn**: \\( t_0 = 39 \\)\n**Cells occupied by walls**:\n\t - Border Cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7.\n\t - Internal Obstacles: [(1, 6)]\n**Snake Positions**:[(3, 6), (4, 6), (4, 5), (4, 4), (5, 4), (6, 4), (6, 3), (5, 3), (4, 3), (3, 3), (3, 4), (2, 4), (2, 5)]\n**Snake Head Direction**: L\n**Food Positions, Life Span and Value**:\n\t- (2, 5, 2, 1)\n\t- (4, 1, 5, 1)\n\t- (2, 4, 8, 1)\n> **Guidance from a Previous Thinking Model:** Turn \\( t_1 = 39 \\)\n> <think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 39. The grid has walls: border cells at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and an internal obstacle at (1,6). So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), with walls on the borders and one internal wall at (1,6).\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (3,6), then (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5). That's 13 segments. Head direction is L, which means left, so moving towards decreasing x.\n> \n> Food:\n> \n> - (2,5) with value 1 and life span 2. So it disappears after 2 turns, including this turn? Life span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 39, life span 2 means it will disappear after turn 40? Let me clarify.\n> \n> Life span: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So for food at (2,5) with life span 2 at turn 39:\n> \n> - Turn 39: life span 2\n> \n> - Turn 40: life span 1 (if not eaten)\n> \n> - Turn 41: gone? No: \"disappears after N turns\" – I think it means it lasts for N turns, so at the start of turn 39, life span is 2, so after turn 39, it decreases to 1, and after turn 40, it decreases to 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten on turn 39 or 40, but not after that.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,1) with value 1, life span 5: available until turn 43? Turn 39: life span 5, turn 40:4, ..., turn 43:1, turn 44: gone. So disappears after turn 43? Let's define turns.\n> \n> Assume that at the beginning of turn t, the life span is given. After the turn, it decreases by one. So for food with life span L at turn t, it can be eaten on turns t, t+1, ..., t+L-1, and disappears after turn t+L-1 or at turn t+L? Better to think in terms of remaining turns.\n> \n> \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" – so on turn t, with life span L, after the turn, life span becomes L-1. If L-1 >0, it remains; if L-1=0, it disappears.\n> \n> So for (2,5): life span 2 at turn 39. After turn 39, if not eaten, life span becomes 1. After turn 40, if not eaten, life span becomes 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten on turn 39 or 40.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,1): life span 5 at turn 39. Can be eaten from turn 39 to 43 inclusive? After turn 39, life span 4; ... after turn 43, life span 0, disappears. So eating possible on turns 39,40,41,42,43.\n> \n> Turn 43: life span at start is 1, after turn, becomes 0, disappears. So yes, can be eaten on turns 39 to 43.\n> \n> (2,4) with value 1, life span 8: can be eaten from turn 39 to 46.\n> \n> All food has value 1, so all positive food, no negative food mentioned. Value is +1 for all.\n> \n> Now, snake head is at (3,6), direction L, so last move was left to (3,6).\n> \n> Possible moves: since head direction is L, I can move L (left), U (up), D (down), but not R (right) because that would be instant reverse? \"No instant reverse\": cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\n> \n> Current head direction is L, so I cannot move R on this turn, because that would be opposite to current movement.\n> \n> Allowed moves: since moving left, I can continue L, or turn U or D, but not R.\n> \n> Also, need to avoid walls and body collisions, but body collision: head touches body segment except tail, because tail moves.\n> \n> Snake positions: head (3,6), then segments: (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5). Tail is at (2,5).\n> \n> If I move to a cell, it should not be a wall or a body segment except the tail, because when I move, the tail also moves, so the cell where tail was becomes free, but only if I don't eat food. If I eat food, tail doesn't move, so the body stays.\n> \n> Standard snake: when you move, if no food eaten, head moves to new cell, tail moves away, so the tail cell is free. If food eaten, head moves to food, tail stays, so snake grows.\n> \n> In this case, food can be under body, but only eaten if body moves away and head moves there.\n> \n> Now, food at (2,5), which is currently occupied by the tail. Tail is at (2,5), and there is food at (2,5) with life span 2.\n> \n> But according to special cases: food can spawn under snake body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves onto it.\n> \n> Here, (2,5) is the tail, so if the snake moves such that the tail moves away, then (2,5) becomes free, but the food is there. Then, if head moves to (2,5), it can eat it.\n> \n> But there's a danger: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills snake, because head and newly grown tail collide.\n> \n> Let's see positions.\n> \n> Head at (3,6), tail at (2,5). Are they adjacent? (3,6) and (2,5): x differs by 1, y differs by 1, so diagonal, not adjacent? Adjacent means sharing an edge, so up, down, left, right, not diagonal.\n> \n> So adjacent cells: for head at (3,6), adjacent are: (3,5) down, (3,7) up, but y=7 is wall, so not, (2,6) left, (4,6) right.\n> \n> (2,6) is left, but (2,6) is not tail; tail is (2,5).\n> \n> (2,5) is not adjacent to (3,6); it's diagonal. Adjacent would be same x or same y, differing by 1.\n> \n> (3,6) adjacent: (4,6) right, (2,6) left, (3,5) down, (3,7) up but y=7 wall, so invalid.\n> \n> (2,5) is at x=2,y=5, which is left and down from (3,6), not sharing an edge.\n> \n> So head and tail are not adjacent; they are diagonal.\n> \n> Therefore, if I eat the food at (2,5), it might be possible without immediate collision, but I need to check the tail reward danger.\n> \n> Tail reward danger only if head is adjacent to tail and tail has food.\n> \n> Here, not adjacent, so should be fine.\n> \n> But let's list all cells.\n> \n> First, possible moves from head (3,6):\n> \n> - Left (L) to (2,6): is (2,6) valid? Not a wall? Walls: borders x=0,x=7,y=0,y=7, and internal (1,6). (2,6) is within bounds, x=2 not 0 or 7, y=6 not 0 or 7, and not (1,6), so free. But is it occupied by body?\n> \n> Snake positions: (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5). So (2,6) is not in this list, so empty? But (2,6) might have food or not, but no food at (2,6), only at (2,5), (4,1), (2,4).\n> \n> (2,4) has food, but (2,6) no.\n> \n> So moving L to (2,6) should be possible, as long as not wall or body.\n> \n> Body: segments are at the positions listed, (2,6) not listed, so free.\n> \n> - Down (D) to (3,5): (3,5) is not in snake positions, not wall, y=5>0, x=3 not 0 or 7, not (1,6), so free.\n> \n> - Up (U) to (3,7): but y=7 is wall, since border, so invalid.\n> \n> - Right (R) to (4,6): but (4,6) is the second segment, body, so collision.

It's turn 40, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since the borders are x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7.

So the snake has 13 segments.\n> \n> The head direction is left, meaning it was moving left to get to (2,6) from (3,6), I assume. Since positions are listed head first, and it came from (3,6) to (2,6), so direction L is consistent.\n> \n> Now, food items:\n> \n> - (2,5) with value 1 and life span 1. So it disappears after this turn if not eaten.\n> \n> - (4,1) with value 1 and life span 4. So it will disappear in 4 turns, meaning after turn 43? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so if life span is N, it disappears after N turns. For (2,5), life span 1, so after turn 40, it will be gone if not eaten now. Similarly, (4,1) life span 4, so it will disappear after turn 43.\n> \n> Life span: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So at turn t, if life span is L, it will last for L more turns, including turn t. After turn t+L-1, it should be gone. Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span).

Let's think.\n> \n> Suppose at turn t, life span is N. After turn t (current turn), countdown decreases by 1, so it becomes N-1. Then after turn t+1, it decreases to N-2, and so on, until after turn t + N - 1, it becomes 0, and it disappears. So it can be eaten from turn t to turn t + N - 1.\n> \n> In this case, for (2,5): at turn 40, life span 1, so it can be eaten only on turn 40.

Turn 40: life span 4, after turn 40, it becomes 3; turn 41: 2; turn 42: 1; turn 43: 0, disappears after turn 43? I think it's better to think that it disappears at the end of turn t + N.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> Perhaps it's like: at the start of turn, if life span is L, it will be present during this turn, and after this turn, life span becomes L-1. If L-1 >=1, it remains, else it disappears.\n> \n> So for (2,5): life span 1 at turn 40, so it can be eaten on turn 40. After turn 40, life span becomes 0, so it disappears.\n> \n> For (4,1): life span 4 at turn 40, so present on turn 40, after turn 40 life span 3, present on 41, after 41 span 2, present 42, after 42 span 1, present 43, after 43 span 0, disappears.\n> \n> So it can be eaten from turn 40 to 43.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,4) value 1, life span 7, so from turn 40 to 46.\n> \n> (2,3) value 1, life span 10, turn 40 to 49.\n> \n> All food has value 1, so all positive food?

No, the new head is (2,5), and the first body segment is the previous head position (2,6), then the second body segment is the previous first body segment position (3,6), and so on, up to the previous tail position (2,4). But since we ate, we don't remove the tail; so the tail stays, meaning that (2,4) is still part of the snake, and we add a new segment at the end? No.\n> \n> Typically, the snake grows by keeping the tail in place for that turn.\n> \n> So positions: after moving head to new position, if no eat, tail is removed.

It's turn 41. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and one internal obstacle at (1,6). So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are off-limits.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (2,5), then body segments: (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4). That's 14 segments. Let me list them in order:\n> \n> - Head: (2,5)\n> \n> - Next: (2,6)\n> \n> - (3,6)\n> \n> - (4,6)\n> \n> - (4,5)\n> \n> - (4,4)\n> \n> - (5,4)\n> \n> - (6,4)\n> \n> - (6,3)\n> \n> - (5,3)\n> \n> - (4,3)\n> \n> - (3,3)\n> \n> - (3,4)\n> \n> - Tail: (2,4)\n> \n> Head direction is down, which is decreasing y, since D is (x,y-1). But the head is at (2,5), and direction is D, so from previous move, it must have come from above, so y was higher. Previous position: since it moved down to (2,5), it came from (2,6)? But (2,6) is the second segment. Let's see the positions: snake positions are given as list, head first. So from (2,5) to (2,6) to (3,6), etc. Direction is D, meaning the last move was down, so head was at (2,6) before moving to (2,5)? But (2,6) is listed as the second segment. I think I need to think about the movement.\n> \n> The head direction is given as D, so on the next move, it can move in directions except up, because no instant reverse. Since current direction is down, it cannot move up on the next turn.\n> \n> Now, food positions:\n> \n> - (4,1) with life span 3, value 1 (positive food)\n> \n> - (2,4) with life span 6, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (2,3) with life span 9, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> All food is positive, no negative food here. Life span decreases each turn, including current turn 41. So for (4,1), life span 3, it will disappear after 3 turns, so by turn 44 it's gone. Similarly, (2,4) life span 6, gone by turn 47, (2,3) life span 9, gone by turn 50.\n> \n> Now, (2,4) is a food position, but (2,4) is also part of the snake body? Let's check snake positions: positions are (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4). So (2,4) is the tail segment.\n> \n> Food at (2,4) with value 1 and life span 6. But it's under the snake's tail. According to rules, food can be under body but can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves onto it later.\n> \n> Also, there's a special case: Tail Reward Danger. If head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills the snake because after eating, tail grows and collides with head.\n> \n> In this case, head is at (2,5), tail at (2,4), which is directly below? (2,5) to (2,4) is down, so adjacent vertically. Head and tail are adjacent.\n> \n> Specifically, head at (2,5), tail at (2,4), so they are adjacent cells.\n> \n> Now, there is food at (2,4), which is the tail position. If the snake tries to eat this food, meaning head moves to (2,4) when the tail is there, but when head moves to (2,4), the tail will move away first? Let's think about the movement.\n> \n> When the snake moves, the head moves to a new cell, and the tail moves away from its current position, so the cell is freed. Then, if the new head position has food, it eats it, and tail doesn't move, so snake grows.\n> \n> But in this case, food is at tail (2,4). If head moves to (2,4), at the same time, tail is supposed to move away. So if head moves to (2,4), and tail moves away, then (2,4) is no longer occupied by tail, so head can move there and eat the food if present.\n> \n> But there's a danger: if head moves to a cell that was the tail, and it eats food, then the snake grows, meaning a new tail segment is added where the tail was, but since tail moved, the new tail is added at the previous tail position after move.\n> \n> Standard snake movement:\n> \n> - Head moves to new cell.\n> \n> - If new cell has food, snake grows: tail stays, so length increases by one.\n> \n> - If no food, tail moves forward, so length same.\n> \n> In this case, if head moves to a cell that currently has food and is occupied by tail, when head moves there:\n> \n> - The tail cell (2,4) is vacated because tail moves away (if no growth) or stays (if growth).\n> \n> But when head moves to (2,4), at that moment, the cell (2,4) might have food.\n> \n> According to rules: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> Also, for Tail Reward Danger: \"If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n> \n> In this scenario: head at (2,5), tail at (2,4), adjacent. Food at (2,4).\n> \n> If head moves down to (2,4):\n> \n> - Head moves to (2,4).\n> \n> - Since (2,4) has food, it eats it: reward +1, snake grows, so tail does not move. Therefore, a new tail segment is added at the current tail position, but since tail was at (2,4), and head is moving to (2,4), after move: head is at (2,4), and because of growth, the tail remains at (2,4)? No.\n> \n> Let's clarify:\n> \n> Before move:\n> \n> - Head: (2,5)\n> \n> - Tail: (2,4)\n> \n> - Food at (2,4)\n> \n> Head moves to (2,4):\n> \n> - New head position: (2,4)\n> \n> - Since (2,4) has food, snake eats it: so the tail does not move. Therefore, the segment that was tail at (2,4) remains, and a new head is at (2,4), but that means two segments at (2,4), which is collision.\n> \n> Yes, that's the Tail Reward Danger. Specifically, head moves to the tail cell, eats food, grows, so now both head and the old tail are at (2,4), but since it's the same cell, it's a collision, snake dies.\n> \n> Therefore, moving to (2,4) now would be fatal because head and tail are adjacent and tail has food.\n> \n> So, I must avoid moving to (2,4) while the food is there and tail is adjacent.\n> \n> In this case, since head is at (2,5) and direction is D, moving down to (2,4) would be instant death.\n> \n> Therefore, I cannot move down to (2,4) right now.\n> \n> Other directions: I can move left, right, or up? But direction is D, so no instant reverse, so I cannot move up (which would be opposite of down).\n> \n> Current direction is D, so possible moves: L, R, D, but D is deadly, so only L or R.\n> \n> Now, grid: let's sketch the grid.\n> \n> Walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Also internal obstacle at (1,6).\n> \n> So, cells: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.

Life span decreases each turn including current, so at turn 41, life span 3, meaning it disappears after 3 turns, so on turn 44 it's gone. So must eat on turn 41, 42, or 43.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,4) food, but we can't eat it now due to danger, life span 6, disappears after turn 46? Turn 41 + 6 -1 = 46? Let's clarify life span.\n> \n> Rule: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) | Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So at turn t, food with life span L will disappear after L turns, so it can be eaten on turns t, t+1, ..., t+L-1.\n> \n> For (4,1): at turn 41, life span 3, so can be eaten on turn 41, 42, 43.

So the snake is 14 segments long.\n> \n> Head direction is Down, which is (x,y-1).

Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 43, life_span=1 means it will be gone after turn 43, so we can only eat it on this turn if we move there.\n> \n> Life span: it says \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So for food at (4,1) with life_span=1, on turn 43, it has 1 turn left, meaning after turn 43, it disappears. So to eat it, we must be on (4,1) at the start of turn 43 or during turn 43? I think when the snake head moves to a food cell, it eats it at that moment.\n> \n> Typically in Snake, when the head enters a cell with food, it eats it immediately. So for food with life_span, it must be eaten before or on the turn when countdown reaches 0.\n> \n> Let's read carefully: \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So for example, food with life_span N spawns at turn T, it exists from turn T to turn T+N-1, and disappears after turn T+N-1, so it can be eaten from turn T to turn T+N-1 inclusive?

Countdown: at turn 43, life_span=4, so it has 4 turns left including current, so it will be gone after turn 46? Let's define.\n> \n> Assume that at the start of turn t, for a food with life_span L, it has L turns left including turn t. After turn t, if not eaten, countdown decreases to L-1, and so on. When countdown reaches 0, it disappears after that turn.\n> \n> For (4,1): life_span=1 at turn 43, so after turn 43, it disappears. Must be eaten during turn 43 to get it.\n> \n> Similarly, (2,4): life_span=4 at turn 43, so it has 4 turns left: exists until after turn 46? At turn 43: countdown=4, after turn 43: countdown=3, after turn 44: countdown=2, after turn 45: countdown=1, after turn 46: countdown=0, disappears.

From above, after removing tail (3,3), the new body is indices 1 to 14: (2,4) to (4,3), but (4,3) is index 14, which becomes the tail.\n> \n> New list: head (1,3), then body: (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), and tail (4,3)? No: the body segments are the previous positions shifted.\n> \n> Standard: the new body starts from the old head position down to the second last, so old head (2,3) becomes new body[1], old body[1] (2,4) becomes new body[2], ..., old body[14] (4,3) becomes new body[15], but since no growth, we don't have a new segment, so the last one is removed.\n> \n> Positions: let S be the list.\n> \n> After move without eat, new_head = new position, new_body = [old_head] + old_body[0:-1] or something.\n> \n> Typically: new_positions = [new_head] + old_positions[:-1]\n> \n> Old positions: [P0, P1, P2, ..., Pk] with P0 head, Pk tail.\n> \n> New head at new_cell.\n> \n> If no eat, new positions: [new_cell, P0, P1, P2, ..., P_{k-1}] so tail Pk is removed.\n> \n> So length same.\n> \n> In this case, old positions at turn 44: [ (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3) ] 16 elements, P0=(2,3), P1=(2,4), ..., P15=(3,3)\n> \n> Move to (1,3) no eat, new positions: [ (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3) ] and (3,3) is gone.

So at turn 44, the snake is facing down, meaning from current head (1,3), if it moves down, it goes to (1,2).\n> \n> But the previous position: since the head is at (1,3) and the next segment is (1,4), that means the snake was moving up to (1,4) before, but now direction is down, so it must have turned around.\n> \n> In terms of movement, for the next move, I need to choose action for turn 44 based on head direction D.\n> \n> Food positions:\n> \n> - (2,4) with life span 4, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (2,3) with life span 6, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (4,2) with life span 9, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> All are positive food, value +1.\n> \n> Life span: each decreases by 1 per turn, including current turn, so at turn 44, life span 4 means it will disappear after 4 more turns? Life span is given as the remaining turns it exists.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span).

Let's clarify: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so at turn 45, life span is 3, meaning after turn 45, it becomes 2, then after turn 46, it becomes 1, and after turn 47, it becomes 0 and disappears.

So after eating, the new head is at (2,4), and the tail doesn't move? No, when you eat food, the head moves to the food cell, and a new segment is added, so the tail stays in place for that turn. Standard snake mechanics: when you eat, head moves to food, body follows, but since length increases, the tail doesn't move, so effectively, the cell where tail was is now part of body.\n> \n> In terms of positions: when snake moves, head moves to new position, each segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, and if food eaten, a new segment is added at the end.\n> \n> But for collision, after move, if head collides with body, it dies.\n> \n> Specifically for this food at (2,4): if I move U to (2,4), I eat it, so length becomes 16.\n> \n> Now, after moving to (2,4), the new positions: head at (2,4), then previous head (2,3) becomes segment 1, then (1,3) segment 2, ..., all the way to tail (4,3) still there, and since length increased, the tail doesn't move, so (4,3) remains tail? Let's think.\n> \n> Current positions before move: head (2,3), body: (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3) — that's 15 segments.\n> \n> After moving head to (2,4) and eating food, the new positions: head at (2,4), then the first body segment is the old head (2,3), then (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), and the tail (4,3) remains since it didn't move, but because we added a segment, the tail is now (4,3), and we have a new segment? I'm confusing myself.\n> \n> Standard: when snake eats, on that move, head moves to food cell, the body segments shift forward, and since length increases, the last segment (tail) is not removed, so the new tail is the old second last or something.\n> \n> After move without eating: head to new position, each body segment to previous position of predecessor, tail position is vacated.\n> \n> With eating: head to new position (food), body segments shift to previous positions, but no tail vacated, so the tail from before is still there, and the segment before tail becomes part of body.\n> \n> In list terms: positions [H, B1, B2, ..., Bk, T]\n> \n> After moving to new cell C:\n> \n> - If not eat, new positions [C, H, B1, B2, ..., Bk] and T is removed.\n> \n> - If eat, new positions [C, H, B1, B2, ..., Bk, T] so length increases by one.\n> \n> In this case, moving to (2,4) which has food, so after move: head at (2,4), then old head (2,3) becomes body, then (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), and tail (4,3) remains.

Head at (2,4), and body segments: (2,3) is directly below, but that's not collision, collision is if head is on same cell as body.\n> \n> (2,4) is head, and the body includes (1,3), (1,4), etc. (1,4) is a body segment at (1,4), which is left and up? (2,4) and (1,4) are adjacent, but not same cell, so no collision.\n> \n> Also, walls: (2,4) is not wall, x=2,y=4, not border or obstacle.\n> \n> But there's a special case: Tail Reward Danger.

Let me confirm: border cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. So the grid is 8x8 in coordinates, but playable cells are x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6. x=0 to 7 inclusive is 8 units, but since walls are at the borders, snake can be from (1,1) to (6,6). For example, snake positions include (3,3), (2,3), etc., all between 1 and 6, so yes, playable grid is 6x6: rows 1-6, columns 1-6.\n> \n> Internal obstacle: (1,6) is a wall. So that cell is blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions: head is at (3,3), direction is R (right), so it's moving right. Body segments: (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3). That's 15 segments. Let me list them in order:\n> \n> Head: (3,3)\n> \n> Then (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3)\n> \n> (5,3) is the tail. Positions are given head first, so (3,3) head, (2,3) next, then (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3) tail. So tail is at (5,3).\n> \n> Now food:\n> \n> - (2,4) with life span 2, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (4,2) with life span 7, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (3,6) with life span 10, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> (3,6) is also a snake position? Snake positions include (3,6), which is the 7th segment or something. Let's see: indices: 0: (3,3), 1: (2,3), 2: (1,3), 3: (1,4), 4: (1,5), 5: (2,5), 6: (2,6), 7: (3,6), ... so (3,6) is occupied by the snake body. But food can spawn under body, and can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves onto it later.\n> \n> Food at (3,6) is listed with life span 10, value 1. But (3,6) is currently occupied by the snake, so it's under the body.\n> \n> Similarly, other food: (2,4) and (4,2) are not occupied? Let's check.\n> \n> Snake positions: (2,4) is not in the list. Positions: (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3). So (2,4) is not there, so it's free? But food is at (2,4), so it should be there.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,2) not in snake positions, so free.\n> \n> (3,6) is in snake positions, so food is under the body there.\n> \n> Life spans: for (2,4), life span 2, meaning it disappears after 2 turns, including current turn? Countdown decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 46, life span 2, so after this turn, it will have life span 1, and if not eaten by turn 47, it disappears? Let's see the rule: \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So for food at turn t with life span L, it will disappear after t + L - 1 turns? Example: at turn t, life span L, after turn t, it becomes L-1, and so on, until L=0, it disappears before the next turn or after? Typically, it should be that at the start of turn t, if life span is L, it decreases to L-1 during the turn, and if L-1=0, it disappears after this turn, meaning it can be eaten on this turn if possible.\n> \n> The rule says: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> I think it's better to think: at the beginning of turn t, the food has remaining life span R. After the turn, R decreases by 1. If after decrease, R=0, it disappears and cannot be eaten on the next turn.\n> \n> But it can be eaten during turn t if head moves to it.\n> \n> Similarly, for turn t, with R remaining, it can be eaten on that turn, then after eating, it's gone, and at end of turn, R decreases, but since it's eaten, it doesn't matter.\n> \n> For food at (2,4) at turn 46, life span 2, so remaining life span 2. After turn 46, it decreases to 1. After turn 47, it decreases to 0 and disappears, so it can be eaten on turn 46 or 47.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,2) life span 7, so many turns left.\n> \n> (3,6) life span 10, but it's under snake body, so need body to move away.\n> \n> Current head direction is R, right, so from (3,3), moving right.\n> \n> Possible moves: since direction is R, I can go U, D, R, but not L, because L would be opposite, left, which is reverse of right, so not allowed. No instant reverse.\n> \n> So from (3,3), head at (3,3), direction R, so next move can be U (up), D (down), or R (right), but not L (left).\n> \n> Now, let's see the grid state.\n> \n> First, walls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, so cannot go there.

It's turn 47. The grid has walls at the borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (1,6). The snake positions are given as a list: head at (4,3), then (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3).

But (3,6) is part of the snake body? Let me check the snake positions.\n> \n> Snake positions: (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3)\n> \n> (3,6) is the 9th segment, so it's occupied by the body. But food can spawn under the body, and it can only be eaten if the body moves away and the head moves onto it.\n> \n> Food at (3,6) has life span 9, so it might be there for a while, but since the snake is on it, the head can't eat it until the body moves off.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (2,4) has life span 1, so it must be eaten this turn or it disappears.\n> \n> Food at (4,2) is free, I think.\n> \n> Now, current head position is (4,3), moving right (R). So from (4,3), moving right would go to (5,3). But let's see what cells are available.\n> \n> First, I need to find possible moves from (4,3) with direction R.\n> \n> Possible actions: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), L (left, x-1), R (right, x+1).\n> \n> But no instant reverse, so since current direction is R, I cannot move L (left) immediately, because that would be opposite.\n> \n> So allowed moves: U, D, R. L is not allowed because it would reverse to left.\n> \n> Current direction R, so opposite is L, so cannot move L. Can move U, D, or R.\n> \n> Now, let's check the grid boundaries.\n> \n> Grid is from x=0 to x=7, y=0 to y=7, so (4,3) is within bounds.\n> \n> Moving to:\n> \n> - U: (4,4)\n> \n> - D: (4,2)\n> \n> - R: (5,3)\n> \n> - L: (3,3) but L is not allowed due to reverse, so we skip.\n> \n> Now, check for collisions:\n> \n> - (4,4): is this occupied? Snake positions: let's list all occupied cells.\n> \n> Snake: (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3)\n> \n> So (4,4) is occupied by the snake body, segment 12th? Positions: index 0: (4,3) head, 1: (3,3), 2: (2,3), 3: (1,3), 4: (1,4), 5: (1,5), 6: (2,5), 7: (2,6), 8: (3,6), 9: (4,6), 10: (4,5), 11: (4,4), 12: (5,4), 13: (6,4), 14: (6,3)\n> \n> So (4,4) is index 11, which is body, not head. If head moves to (4,4), it would collide with body segment at (4,4), but when the snake moves, the tail moves, so let's think carefully.\n> \n> In snake movement, when the head moves to a new cell, and if it's not food, the tail moves away, so the cell that was tail is now free. But if the head moves to a cell that is currently occupied by body, it might collide, except for the tail.\n> \n> Specifically, if the head moves to a cell that is occupied by any body segment except the current tail, it collides and dies. But if it moves to the tail cell, since the tail moves, it's ok.\n> \n> In this case, (4,4) is occupied by index 11, which is not the tail. Tail is (6,3), index 14.\n> \n> So moving to (4,4) would be collision because it's body.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,3): is (5,3) occupied? Looking at snake positions, (5,4) is index 12, (6,4) index 13, (6,3) index 14. (5,3) is not listed, so should be free? Let's list all x,y:\n> \n> x: 4,3,2,1,1,1,2,2,3,4,4,4,5,6,6\n> \n> y: 3,3,3,3,4,5,5,6,6,6,5,4,4,4,3\n> \n> So positions: (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3)\n> \n> (5,3) is not in this list, so it should be empty.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,2) is not in list, empty.\n> \n> (4,4) is occupied, as above.\n> \n> Also, walls: borders x=0,7 y=0,7, and internal (1,6). (1,6) is occupied by wall, but snake has (2,6) and (1,5), etc., but (1,6) is wall, so cannot go there.\n> \n> For moving to (5,3): x=5,y=3, not border, not wall, and not occupied by snake except possibly tail, but tail is (6,3), different cell.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,2): x=4,y=2, not border, not wall, not occupied.\n> \n> (4,4) occupied, cannot go there.\n> \n> U to (4,4) is invalid.\n> \n> D to (4,2) is possible.\n> \n> R to (5,3) is possible.\n> \n> L to (3,3) but L not allowed due to reverse.\n> \n> So possible moves: D or R.\n> \n> D: (4,2) or R: (5,3)\n> \n> Now, there is food at (4,2) with value 1, life span 6.\n> \n> If I move D to (4,2), I eat the food, since it's positive food, snake length increases by 1, and I get +1 score.\n> \n> But I need to think long-term, 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> Also, food at (2,4) with life span 1, must be eaten this turn or lost.\n> \n> But (2,4) is not adjacent to head? Head at (4,3), (2,4) is two cells away, not reachable in one move. So I cannot eat it this turn unless I move directly to it, but from (4,3), moving to (2,4) is not possible in one step; only adjacent cells.\n> \n> Possible moves are only to (4,2), (5,3), or (4,4) but (4,4) occupied, so only (4,2) or (5,3).\n> \n> (2,4) is not adjacent, so I cannot eat it this turn. Since life span is 1, it will disappear after this turn, so it's gone forever if not eaten now, but I can't reach it, so it will disappear.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (3,6) is under the body at (3,6), which is segment 8, so I can't eat it now.\n> \n> So for turn 47, I have to choose between moving to (4,2) or (5,3).\n> \n> If I move to (4,2), I eat the food there, snake grows to length 16.\n> \n> If I move to (5,3), no food, so snake doesn't grow, tail moves, so length stays 15.\n> \n> But I need to think about future moves.\n> \n> Let me sketch the grid.\n> \n> Grid 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), with walls at borders and (1,6).\n> \n> Snake positions:\n> \n> Head: (4,3)\n> \n> Body: (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3)  // 14 body segments.\n> \n> After move, if no food eaten, tail moves away.\n> \n> Food: (2,4) - but will disappear after this turn since life span 1.\n> \n> (4,2) - free, value 1\n> \n> (3,6) - under snake, life span 9\n> \n> Now, for turn 47, actions:\n> \n> Option 1: Move D to (4,2) - eat food, grow to 16 segments.\n> \n> Then new head position (4,2), direction down? But direction: I moved down, so new direction is D.\n> \n> Snake will be: head (4,2), then previous head (4,3) becomes neck, and so on, tail (6,3) moves off if no growth, but since I ate food, no tail move, so snake becomes: (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3)  // 16 segments, tail at (6,3)\n> \n> Positions: new head (4,2), then the old segments: index 0 was (4,3) now at position 1, index 1 (3,3) at position 2, ..., up to index 13 (6,4) at position 14, index 14 (6,3) at position 15. And since I ate food, I add a new segment at the end, but when eating, the tail doesn't move, so the new tail is the old tail, but since I grow, the segment that was tail remains, and I add a new segment? No.\n> \n> Standard snake: when head eats food, it moves to the food cell, and the tail does not move, so length increases by one. So the new position is the head at food cell, followed by the previous head, and all body, with tail unchanged.\n> \n> So from old positions: head was at (4,3), body segments from index 1 to 14.\n> \n> After moving head to (4,2) and eating food, new snake: head (4,2), then (4,3) [old head], then (3,3) [index1], (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3)  // so 16 segments, tail at (6,3)\n> \n> Now, direction is D.\n> \n> Option 2: Move R to (5,3) - no food, so no growth, tail moves.\n> \n> Head to (5,3), then new positions: (5,3), (4,3) [old head], (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4)  // tail (6,3) is removed, so 14 segments? Original 15 segments, head moves to new cell, tail moves off, so new length 15? Positions: head (5,3), then body: old head (4,3), then index1 (3,3), up to index13 (6,4), and index14 (6,3) is removed.\n> \n> Old positions: index 0: (4,3), 1:(3,3), 2:(2,3), 3:(1,3), 4:(1,4), 5:(1,5), 6:(2,5), 7:(2,6), 8:(3,6), 9:(4,6), 10:(4,5), 11:(4,4), 12:(5,4), 13:(6,4), 14:(6,3)\n> \n> After move R to (5,3), no food: new head (5,3), then body: (4,3) [old head], (3,3) [index1], (2,3) [2], (1,3) [3], (1,4) [4], (1,5) [5], (2,5) [6], (2,6) [7], (3,6) [8], (4,6) [9], (4,5) [10], (4,4) [11], (5,4) [12], (6,4) [13]  // and (6,3) is removed, so 14 segments? Index 13 was (6,4), which is now the last, but (6,4) was index13, now it becomes the tail, and (6,3) index14 is gone.\n> \n> Number of segments: from head to (6,4), which is 14 segments? Let's count: positions from 0 to 13 were 14, but with head new, it's 14 segments? Original: 15 positions. After move, head new position, body from old head to old second last, so if no growth, length same, but tail cell removed.\n> \n> Original length 15. After move, new head, then 14 body segments from old positions except the tail is removed, so new body has 14 segments including the neck? New snake: head at (5,3), then the first body segment is old head (4,3), which was one segment, then old index1 (3,3), ..., up to old index13 (6,4). Old index13 is (6,4), which was the 14th segment? Indices: 0 to 14, 15 segments.\n> \n> After move: new head at (5,3), then old head (4,3) becomes body segment 1, old index1 (3,3) becomes body segment 2, ..., old index13 (6,4) becomes body segment 14, and old index14 (6,3) is removed. So the new snake has head and 14 body segments, total 15 segments? Body segments: from old head to old index13, that's 14 cells, plus new head, total 15, yes. Tail is now at (6,4).\n> \n> Similarly, for eating case, with growth, head new, then all old segments, so 16 segments.\n> \n> Back to decision.\n> \n> If I move D to (4,2), I eat food, grow to 16, head at (4,2), direction D.\n> \n> If I move R to (5,3), no eat, length 15, head at (5,3), direction R.\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5 turns ahead.\n> \n> Also, food at (2,4) will disappear after this turn, so it's gone.\n> \n> Food at (3,6) is under body, life span 9, so it has 9 turns left, including this turn? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 47, life span 1 for (2,4), so after turn 47, it disappears. For (4,2), life span 6, so it will disappear after 6 turns if not eaten. Similarly for (3,6), life span 9.\n> \n> But (3,6) is under snake body, so it can only be eaten when the body moves away.\n> \n> Current body at (3,6) is segment 8.\n> \n> When the snake moves, that cell might be freed if the tail moves or something.\n> \n> But for now, let's consider the two options for turn 47.\n> \n> First, option: move D to (4,2)\n> \n> Then turn 47: move D, eat food at (4,2), snake grows to 16, head at (4,2), direction D.\n> \n> Now turn 48: from (4,2), direction D, so moving down.\n> \n> Possible moves: U, D, L, R, but no instant reverse, so cannot move U (up) because opposite to D.\n> \n> So can move L (left), R (right), or D (down).\n> \n> Now, cells:\n> \n> - L: (3,2)\n> \n> - R: (5,2)\n> \n> - D: (4,1)\n> \n> Now, check walls: y=0 is wall, so (4,1) is y=1, not wall? y=0 is wall, y=1 is not border wall.

It's turn 48, and I'm playing Snake on a 7x7 grid since the borders are from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7. That means the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), because walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (1,6).\n> \n> Snake positions: The head is at (4,2), and the direction is down, which is D. So moving down means increasing y, I assume? Let me confirm the coordinate system. The problem says U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), L is (x-1,y), R is (x+1,y). So y increases up, decreases down. That means (4,2) with direction D, so if it moves down, it would go to (4,1), but y=1 is within bounds, y=0 is wall.\n> \n> List the snake positions in order: head is (4,2), then (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3). That's 16 segments.\n> \n> Now, food: There's only one food item mentioned: (3,6) with value 1 and life span 9. But (3,6) is also a part of the snake's body. Specifically, looking at the positions, (3,6) is the 10th segment in the list? Let's index them:\n> \n> Position 0: head (4,2)\n> \n> 1: (4,3)\n> \n> 2: (3,3)\n> \n> 3: (2,3)\n> \n> 4: (1,3)\n> \n> 5: (1,4)\n> \n> 6: (1,5)\n> \n> 7: (2,5)\n> \n> 8: (2,6)\n> \n> 9: (3,6)  <-- this is where the food is\n> \n> 10: (4,6)\n> \n> 11: (4,5)\n> \n> 12: (4,4)\n> \n> 13: (5,4)\n> \n> 14: (6,4)\n> \n> 15: (6,3)  tail\n> \n> Food is at (3,6), which is currently occupied by the 9th body segment. So the food is under the snake's body.\n> \n> Now, life span is 9, meaning it disappears after 9 turns, including this turn. So from turn 48, it will disappear after turn 48 + 8? Let's see: \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So at turn 48, life_span=9, so it will be there for 9 more turns: turns 48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56, and disappear after turn 56? Or after N turns means it disappears when countdown reaches 0.\n> \n> \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So at turn t, if life_span is L, it will be present for L more turns, including turn t. So for turn t, countdown starts at L, decreases by 1 each turn, and when countdown reaches 0, it disappears before the next turn or after?\n> \n> Standard interpretation: at turn t, with life_span L, it will disappear after L-1 more turns? Let's think carefully.\n> \n> Suppose at turn t, food has life_span N. After this turn, countdown becomes N-1 for next turn. It disappears when countdown reaches 0. So it is present on turns where countdown > 0.\n> \n> At turn t, life_span N, so after turn t, it has N-1 left. After turn t+1, N-2, ..., after turn t + (N-1), it has 1 left, then after turn t + N -1, at the start of turn t + N, countdown is 0, so it disappears before turn t + N? I need to clarify.\n> \n> The rule says: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> I think it's better to think: at the beginning of turn t, if food has life_span L, it will be present during turn t, and then the countdown decreases to L-1 for the next turn. It is removed when countdown reaches 0.\n> \n> So for this food: at turn 48, life_span=9, so it is present on turn 48. After turn 48, countdown becomes 8 for turn 49. It will be present until turn 48 + 8 = turn 56? Let's calculate:\n> \n> - Turn 48: countdown=9 (present)\n> \n> - After turn 48: countdown=8\n> \n> - Turn 49: countdown=8 (present)\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - Turn 56: countdown=1 (present? countdown=1 at start of turn)\n> \n> - After turn 56: countdown=0, so it disappears before turn 57.\n> \n> So it is present from turn 48 to turn 56 inclusive. That's 9 turns: 48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56. Disappears after turn 56.\n> \n> Now, the head is at (4,2), direction D. Current direction is down, so from (4,2), moving down would go to (4,1). But y=1 is within bounds, and no wall there? Walls are at y=0, so (4,1) should be ok, but let's check if it's occupied.\n> \n> Snake positions: (4,2) is head, then (4,3) is just below? y decreases down, so (4,2) to (4,1) would be down, but (4,3) is above since y+1 is up? Coordinate system: U: (x,y+1) so y increases up, D: (x,y-1) y decreases down.\n> \n> So (4,2) with D direction. Moving D would go to (4,1). Is (4,1) free? Snake positions: from the list, (4,2), (4,3), etc. (4,3) is at y=3, which is above (4,2) since y=3 > y=2. So (4,1) is not in the snake positions, and not a wall, so it should be free.\n> \n> But we need to think multiple turns ahead.\n> \n> Also, there's food at (3,6), which is under the body at position (3,6), which is segment 9.\n> \n> To eat that food, since it's under the body, we need to move the body away so that (3,6) is free, and then move the head there.\n> \n> Currently, the head is at (4,2), and (3,6) is far away.\n> \n> First, let's map the grid to visualize.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, but walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so playable cells are x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x=1 to 6, similarly y=1 to 6. But internal obstacle at (1,6), which is within.\n> \n> So grid: 6x6 playable area, from (1,1) to (6,6).\n> \n> Walls: all cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Internal: (1,6).\n> \n> So (1,6) is an obstacle, cannot move there.\n> \n> Snake positions:\n> \n> Head: (4,2)\n> \n> Then: (4,3)  // this is north of head? y=3 > y=2, so up.\n> \n> Then (3,3) west\n> \n> (2,3) west\n> \n> (1,3) west\n> \n> (1,4) north\n> \n> (1,5) north\n> \n> (1,5) is at (1,5), then (2,5) east? x=2>1\n> \n> (2,5) to (2,6) north\n> \n> (2,6) to (3,6) east\n> \n> (3,6) to (4,6) east\n> \n> (4,6) to (4,5) south? y=5<6\n> \n> (4,5) to (4,4) south\n> \n> (4,4) to (5,4) east\n> \n> (5,4) to (6,4) east\n> \n> (6,4) to (6,3) south\n> \n> Tail: (6,3)\n> \n> Now food at (3,6), which is currently occupied by the snake body.\n> \n> To eat this food, we need to move the snake such that the body moves away from (3,6), and then head moves to (3,6).\n> \n> But (3,6) is part of the body, so as the snake moves, the tail will move, but segments move only when the head moves.\n> \n> When the head moves, the entire snake shifts, so the segment at (3,6) will move to the next position based on the movement.\n> \n> Current position of segment at (3,6): it's between (2,6) and (4,6). From the list: after (2,6) is (3,6), then (4,6). So when the snake moves, if head moves, say, down to (4,1), then the body shifts: the first body segment moves to where head was, (4,2), then next to (4,3), and so on, so the segment at (3,6) will move to where the previous segment was? Let's think carefully.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment in the chain.\n> \n> So for example, if head moves from (4,2) to (4,1), then:\n> \n> - New head: (4,1)\n> \n> - Segment that was at index 1 (4,3) moves to (4,2) (old head position)\n> \n> - Index 2 (3,3) moves to (4,3)\n> \n> - Index 3 (2,3) moves to (3,3)\n> \n> - Index 4 (1,3) moves to (2,3)\n> \n> - Index 5 (1,4) moves to (1,3)? No, the positions are updated sequentially.\n> \n> The new position for each segment is the position of the previous segment before the move.\n> \n> Before move: positions: [ (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3) ]\n> \n> After head moves to (4,1):\n> \n> - Head new: (4,1)\n> \n> - Body segments: the first body segment moves to old head position (4,2)\n> \n> - Second body segment moves to old first body position (4,3)\n> \n> - Third to old second (3,3)\n> \n> - Fourth to old third (2,3)\n> \n> - Fifth to old fourth (1,3)\n> \n> - Sixth to old fifth (1,4)\n> \n> - Seventh to old sixth (1,5)\n> \n> - Eighth to old seventh (2,5)\n> \n> - Ninth to old eighth (2,6)\n> \n> - Tenth to old ninth (3,6)  <-- this was the food position\n> \n> - Eleventh to old tenth (4,6)\n> \n> - And so on.\n> \n> The cell (3,6) was occupied by the ninth segment. After the move, that segment moves to the position of the eighth segment, which was (2,6). So (2,6) is now occupied, and (3,6) is now free, because no segment is moving to (3,6); the segment that was there moved to (2,6), and the segment that was at (4,6) moves to (3,6)? Let's see:\n> \n> After move:\n> \n> - Index 0: new head (4,1)\n> \n> - Index 1: old index 0: (4,2)\n> \n> - Index 2: old index 1: (4,3)\n> \n> - Index 3: old index 2: (3,3)\n> \n> - Index 4: old index 3: (2,3)\n> \n> - Index 5: old index 4: (1,3)\n> \n> - Index 6: old index 5: (1,4)\n> \n> - Index 7: old index 6: (1,5)\n> \n> - Index 8: old index 7: (2,5)\n> \n> - Index 9: old index 8: (2,6)\n> \n> - Index 10: old index 9: (3,6)  <-- this segment moves from (3,6) to (2,6)? No: index 9 moves to old index 8 position, which is (2,6)\n> \n> - Index 10 moves to old index 9 position, which is (3,6)\n> \n> - Index 11 moves to old index 10 position (4,6)\n> \n> - Etc.\n> \n> So after the move, the cell (3,6) is now occupied by index 10, which moved from (4,6) to (3,6). So (3,6) is still occupied, by a different segment.\n> \n> Similarly, the cell that was (3,6) is now free only if no segment moves there, but in this case, index 10 moves to (3,6), so it's occupied.\n> \n> In general, when the snake moves, the only cell that might become free is the tail position if no food is eaten, but since no food is eaten here, the tail moves away, so the old tail position (6,3) becomes free, but (3,6) remains occupied because the segment that was there moves away, but another segment moves in? No.\n> \n> In this case, for cell (3,6):\n> \n> - Before move: occupied by index 9\n> \n> - After move: index 9 moves to (2,6), and index 10 moves to (3,6), so (3,6) is now occupied by index 10.\n> \n> So it's still occupied, just by a different part of the body.\n> \n> The cell becomes free only if it was the tail and we don't eat food, so the tail moves, leaving the cell empty.\n> \n> But for a body segment not at the end, when the snake moves, that cell is vacated but immediately reoccupied by the next segment.\n> \n> So for a body cell to become free, it must be that the segment moving away is not followed by another segment moving in, which only happens for the tail.\n> \n> Therefore, for food under the body, to free it, we need the tail to move away from that position or for the snake to move such that that segment is the last to leave.\n> \n> Specifically, for (3,6), it is currently occupied by index 9. This segment will move away when the snake moves, but since index 10 is behind it, index 10 will move to (3,6) when the snake moves, so (3,6) remains occupied unless we eat food or something.\n> \n> The only way to free a body-occupied cell is if that cell is the tail position, and we move the tail away without eating food there.\n> \n> But (3,6) is not the tail; the tail is at (6,3).\n> \n> So to free (3,6), we need to move the snake such that the segment at (3,6) becomes the tail, or something.\n> \n> Let's think about the tail. The tail is at (6,3). When we don't eat food, the tail moves, so the position (6,3) will be free after the move.\n> \n> For (3,6), it is a middle segment, so it will always be occupied as long as the snake is there, because when it moves, the previous segment moves in.\n> \n> The food at (3,6) can only be eaten if the snake moves such that the head moves to (3,6) at a time when (3,6) is not occupied by the body, which requires that the body has moved away from it.\n> \n> That means we need the segment that is currently at (3,6) to move away, and no other segment to move to it immediately, which can only happen if (3,6) is the tail position at some point.\n> \n> In other words, we need to shorten the snake or move so that (3,6) becomes the tail.\n> \n> But we can't shorten the snake; only by eating negative food, but there's no negative food here.\n> \n> We can eat the food at (3,6) only when the snake has moved such that the cell is free, and then head moves there.\n> \n> But to make (3,6) free, the segment that is there must move away and not be replaced, which means it must be the tail at that moment.\n> \n> So we need to move the snake so that the segment at (3,6) becomes the tail. That means we need to consume all segments after it, which we can't do directly; it happens when the snake moves and we don't eat food, so the tail shortens, but the tail is at (6,3), which is far.\n> \n> The distance from head to the food segment: the food is at index 9 in the positions list. Head is index 0, so there are 9 segments before the tail, but the tail is index 15.\n> \n> Positions: 16 segments, indices 0 to 15.\n> \n> Food at (3,6) is position of index 9.\n> \n> Tail is index 15 at (6,3).\n> \n> To make index 9 the tail, we need to have the snake shorten by 6 segments, since there are 6 segments after it (indices 10 to 15).\n> \n> Shortening happens when we don't eat food; each time we move without eating, the tail is removed, so the snake shortens by one.\n> \n> Currently, with 16 segments, if we move without eating food, the snake becomes 15 segments, tail moves, etc.\n> \n> To make index 9 the tail, we need to move 6 times without eating any food, so that the first 6 segments after head are kept, and the tail is removed step by step.\n> \n> After moving k times without eating, the snake shortens by k, so the segment that was at position m will be at position m-k in the new shorter snake.\n> \n> Let's say current positions: indices 0 to L-1, L=16.\n> \n> After one move without eating, new positions: head at new position, then indices 0 to L-2 of old become indices 1 to L-1 of new, so the old tail is gone.\n> \n> For a specific segment at old index i, after k moves without eating, if i >= k, it becomes index i-k in the new snake, and if i < k, it might be gone if k > i, but since we start from head, indices from 0.\n> \n> After k moves without eating, the snake has L - k segments.\n> \n> The segment that was at index i will be at index i - k, provided that i - k >= 0, otherwise it is removed.\n> \n> For example, after k=1 move without eating, old index 0 is new head? No: after move, new head is the new position, old index 0 becomes new index 1, old index 1 becomes new index 2, ..., old index L-2 becomes new index L-1, old index L-1 is removed.\n> \n> So old index i becomes new index i+1 for i from 0 to L-2, but new index 0 is the new head position.\n> \n> The body segments are shifted: the segment that was at old index i is now at new index i+1 for i from 0 to L-2, and the last one is removed.\n> \n> The position that was occupied by old index i is now occupied by new index i+1, except for the tail.\n> \n> For the cell at (3,6), currently occupied by old index 9.\n> \n> After one move without eating, the segment that was at index 9 is now at new index 10, but in terms of position, it moves to the position of old index 8 or something.\n> \n> As above, after move, the cell (3,6) is occupied by the segment that was at old index 10, which moves to (3,6) if the movement is such, but in general, the cell may not be free.\n> \n> To make the cell (3,6) free, we need that at some point, it is the tail position, and we move the tail away.\n> \n> Currently, (3,6) is not the tail; the tail is at (6,3).\n> \n> We need to move the snake so that (3,6) becomes the tail position.\n> \n> That means we need to have all segments after it consumed or moved past.\n> \n> Since we can only shorten by not eating, we need to not eat food for several moves until the segment that was at index 9 becomes the tail.\n> \n> Currently, index 9 is the 10th segment (since 0-based, it's the 10th), and tail is index 15, so there are 6 segments after it.\n> \n> After 6 moves without eating, the snake will have 16-6=10 segments, and the segment that was at index 9 will be at index 9-6=3? Let's calculate.\n> \n> After k moves without eating:\n> \n> - The new length is L - k\n> \n> - The segment that was at old index i will be at new index i, but only if i < L - k? No.\n> \n> After first move without eating: new snake: new head, then old indices 0 to L-2 become new indices 1 to L-1.\n> \n> So old index i becomes new index i+1 for i from 0 to L-2.\n> \n> After second move without eating: from this new snake, old index j becomes new index j+1 for j from 0 to L-2, but this \"old\" is the after-first-move snake.\n> \n> It's messy.\n> \n> The position that was occupied by old index i will be occupied by new index i for i from 1 to L-1 after one move, but new index i is the segment that was old index i-1.\n> \n> For the cell to be free, it must be the tail cell at that time.\n> \n> So for (3,6) to be free, it must be the tail position when we move.\n> \n> Currently, it is not the tail.\n> \n> We can make it the tail by not eating food for 6 moves, but after 6 moves, the position (3,6) may not be the tail because the snake has moved.\n> \n> The tail position changes as the snake moves.\n> \n> To have (3,6) as the tail, we need to move the snake in such a way that after some moves, the tail is at (3,6).\n> \n> But currently the tail is at (6,3), and the food is at (3,6), which is different.\n> \n> We need to bring the tail to (3,6) or move the snake so that (3,6) becomes the end.\n> \n> But since the snake is connected, it's difficult.\n> \n> Perhaps it's not feasible to eat this food because it's under the body and we can't free it easily.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> And \"the body moves away\" means that at some point, the cell is vacated.\n> \n> That can only happen if that cell is the tail position and we move the tail away.\n> \n> So for (3,6), we need to have the snake positioned such that (3,6) is the tail, then when we move, the tail leaves, so (3,6) is free, then later the head can move to it.\n> \n> But currently, (3,6) is not the tail.\n> \n> We can try to move the snake so that (3,6) becomes the tail.\n> \n> For example, if we move the head in a way that the tail end moves towards (3,6), but it's complicated.\n> \n> Let's see the current tail position (6,3), and food at (3,6).\n> \n> The snake is long, 16 segments.\n> \n> Perhaps it's not worth it to try to eat this food, especially since it has a life span of 9 turns, so we have until turn 56.\n> \n> But we need to maximize score, so we should consider if it's possible and low risk.\n> \n> First, let's see what moves are possible now.\n> \n> Head at (4,2), direction down.\n> \n> Possible moves: U, D, L, R, but cannot move opposite to current direction. Current direction is D, so cannot move U (up), because opposite.\n> \n> Opposite of D is U, since D is down, U is up.\n> \n> So can move D, L, or R.\n> \n> Moving D to (4,1): is (4,1) free? Not occupied by snake or wall? Walls: y=0 is wall, so (4,0) is wall, but (4,1) is playable. Snake positions: (4,1) not in list, so yes, free.\n> \n> Moving L to (3,2): (3,2) is not in snake positions? Positions: head (4,2), then (4,3), (3,3), etc. (3,2) is not listed, so should be free. Also not wall.\n> \n> Moving R to (5,2): similarly, not in positions, not wall.\n> \n> So all three directions possible.\n> \n> But we need to think ahead.\n> \n> Also, there might be risks.\n> \n> For example, moving down to (4,1): then from there, possible moves.\n> \n> But let's consider the food.\n> \n> Since the food is at (3,6) with value 1, and we have to avoid risks, and it might be hard to eat it, perhaps we should ignore it for now and focus on survival and other opportunities, but there's only one food mentioned, so no other food.\n> \n> The state says \"Food Positions: (3,6,9,1)\" so only one food on the grid.\n> \n> So we need to eat this to score, but it's under the body.\n> \n> Perhaps we can eat it when the body moves away.\n> \n> The life span is 9, so we have 9 turns to eat it.\n> \n> Current turn 48, disappears after turn 56.\n> \n> So we can plan to eat it later.\n> \n> But let's see where the snake is.\n> \n> The head is at (4,2), and the food is at (3,6), which is up and left.\n> \n> Also, the snake is coiled, so there might be risks of collision if we move carelessly.\n> \n> For example, from (4,2), if we move left to (3,2), then we are at (3,2), which is adjacent to (3,3), which is a body segment.\n> \n> (3,3) is the second body segment, index 2.\n> \n> But it's not the tail, so if head moves to (3,2), and (3,3) is body, but after move, the body will move, so it's ok, as long as not colliding with other parts.\n> \n> Collision: head touches any body segment except the tail, because tail will move.\n> \n> In this case, moving to (3,2): is (3,2) occupied? No, currently free.\n> \n> After moving to (3,2), the new head is (3,2), then the body: first body segment moves to (4,2), which was old head, then second to (4,3), etc.\n> \n> (3,3) is old index 2, which will move to old index 1 position, (4,3), so (3,3) is vacated, and head is at (3,2), which is not touching any body except possibly the neck, but the neck is at (4,2) now, which is adjacent but not the same cell, so no collision.\n> \n> Collision is when head moves to a cell occupied by body, but (3,2) is free, so no problem.\n> \n> Similarly for other moves.\n> \n> But there is a special case: \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> But here, tail is at (6,3), head at (4,2), not adjacent.\n> \n> Adjacent means sharing a cell or adjacent cells? Collision is when head moves to a cell with body, but for tail reward danger, it's when head is adjacent to the tail cell, meaning they are next to each other, and the tail cell has food, so if head moves to it, we eat the food, snake grows, so the new tail is where the old tail was, but since head was adjacent and moves to tail, after eating, the head is on the food cell, and the new tail is the old tail position, but since the snake grows, the tail doesn't move, so the head is on the food, and the tail is still there, so if they were adjacent, now head is on tail cell, but tail cell is now head, and the segment that was tail is now the second last, so no collision, but the rule says it kills.\n> \n> Let's read: \"If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n> \n> When you eat food, the snake grows, so when you move to the food cell, you eat it, so the head moves to the food cell, and since it's food, the tail does not move, so the snake grows: the new head is on the food cell, and the tail remains where it was.\n> \n> If the head was adjacent to the tail before the move, and you move to the tail cell (which has food), then after eating, the head is on that cell, and the tail is still there, but the tail cell is now occupied by the new head, and the old tail is now the second last segment, so the new head and the old tail are on the same cell? No.\n> \n> Before move: head at H, tail at T, and H and T are adjacent.\n> \n> You move head to T, which has food.\n> \n> After move: new head at T (since you moved to T), you eat the food, so the snake grows: the new positions are: new head at T, then the old head at H becomes the new neck, and the tail remains at T?

(4,4), then (4,5), then (4,6), then (3,6), then (2,6), etc.\n> \n> So after 6 moves, the tail will be at (3,6), because from (6,3) to (6,4) move 1, (5,4) move 2, (4,4) move 3, (4,5) move 4, (4,6) move

It's turn 49. The grid has borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7). There's an internal obstacle at (1,6).\n> \n> The snake positions are given as a list: head at (4,1), then (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4). So the snake has 16 segments. The head is at (4,1) and the tail is at (6,4).\n> \n> The snake's head direction is D, which is down. That means it's moving downward, so from (4,1), moving down would be to (4,0), but y=0 is a wall, so that would be a collision. But let's confirm the direction. Head direction is given as D, and positions: head at (4,1), next segment at (4,2). (4,2) has a higher y-value than (4,1), so if y increases upwards or downwards? Typically in grids, y=0 is top or bottom? The movement definitions: U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), so if D is (x,y-1), that means decreasing y is down, so y=0 is probably the bottom row, and y=7 is the top? Let's see the wall description.\n> \n> Walls: border cells x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7. And internal obstacle (1,6). Now, snake positions: head (4,1), then (4,2). (4,2) has y=2, which is greater than y=1, so since D is (x,y-1), moving down decreases y, so from (4,1) to (4,0) would be down, but (4,2) has higher y, so the body is below the head? That doesn't make sense with direction.\n> \n> Head direction is D, meaning it was moving down to get to (4,1). But the next segment is (4,2), which has y=2 > y=1, so if y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top, then moving down decreases y, so from a higher y to lower y. So if head is at (4,1), and it was moving down, it should have come from (4,2) or something. Positions are listed head first: [(4,1), (4,2), ...], so (4,1) is head, (4,2) is the first body segment. That means the head is at (4,1) and the body is at (4,2), which has a higher y-coordinate, so if y increases as we go up, then (4,2) is above (4,1), so the snake is moving downward to (4,1) from (4,2)? But direction is given as current head direction, which is D.\n> \n> I think I have a confusion. The head direction is the direction it is facing or moving towards. So if head is at (4,1) and direction is D, that means on the next move, if it continues down, it would go to (4,0). But (4,0) is a wall since y=0 is border.\n> \n> Similarly, the segment behind it is (4,2), which is at y=2, so with y decreasing down, (4,2) is north of (4,1), so the snake is moving south.\n> \n> But in the positions, after (4,2), it's (4,3), which is y=3, even higher, then (3,3), etc. Let's list all positions with coordinates:\n> \n> - Head: (4,1)\n> \n> - Body: (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6)?

Life_span is given as current remaining life, so it decreases each turn.\n> \n> \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so at turn t, if life_span is L, it will disappear at turn t + L if not eaten. After turn t + L, it's gone.\n> \n> For (3,6): life_span=8 at turn 49, so if not eaten, it disappears after turn 49+8=57.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,4): life_span=10, disappears after turn 49+10=59.\n> \n> Snake head at (4,1), direction D (down).

Walls are borders x=0,7 y=0,7 and internal (1,6).

It's turn 50, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since the walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think? Let me confirm the coordinates.\n> \n> The walls are defined as border cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7, meaning that x=0 and x=7 are walls, and y=0 and y=7 are walls. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (1,6). Snake positions are given, and food at (3,6) with life span 7 and value 1 (positive), and (6,4) with life span 9 and value 1 (positive).\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (5,1), then (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4). So the tail is at (5,4).\n> \n> Head direction is R, meaning right, so last move was to the right. From the positions, head is at (5,1), which is right of previous position (4,1), so yes, direction is right.\n> \n> Now, possible moves: since head direction is R, I can go U (up), D (down), or R (right), but not L (left) because that would be instant reverse, which is not allowed. So actions: U, D, R.\n> \n> I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks. Prioritize long-term survival.\n> \n> First, let's map out the grid. Walls at borders, so playable cells: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except internal obstacle at (1,6).\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (1,6), which is already a wall, so no issue.\n> \n> Now, food locations:\n> \n> - Food at (3,6): value 1, life span 7. Current turn is 50, so it disappears after turn 50 + 7 - 1? Life span decreases every turn including current, so if life span is N at turn t, it disappears after N turns, meaning it lasts until turn t + N - 1.\n> \n> Let's clarify: \"Life-span disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n> \n> So at turn t, with life span L, it will disappear after L turns, meaning it exists for L more turns including the current one? Countdown decreases every turn, so at turn t, countdown is L, then at turn t+1, countdown L-1, ..., down to 0, and when countdown reaches 0, it disappears after that turn or at the end of the turn?\n> \n> Typically, if countdown decreases every turn including current, and disappears after N turns, I think it means that at the start of turn t, if food has life span N, it will be there for this turn and N-1 more turns, so it disappears at the end of turn t + N - 1.\n> \n> For example, at turn t, life span N, after this turn, countdown becomes N-1, and so on, until countdown 0, then after turn when countdown was 0, it disappears. So it is present for N turns: from turn t to turn t + N - 1.\n> \n> Similarly here: for food at (3,6), life span 7 at turn 50, so it will be present from turn 50 to 56 inclusive?

But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, when moving, if the head moves to a cell that is currently occupied by the tail, it is safe because the tail will move away, so no collision.\n> \n> But if it moves to any other body segment, it collides and dies.\n> \n> In this case, moving L to (4,1): what is (4,1)? From snake positions: [(5,1), (4,1), (4,2), ...] so (4,1) is the second segment, which is not the tail. Tail is at (5,4).

Current positions: 16 segments, after move no food, head to (6,1), previous head (5,1) becomes body, but the last segment tail (5,4) is removed, so the body segments from index 1 to 15: (4,1) to (4,5) and (5,4) removed, but (4,5) is the second last? Indices: after move, new head (6,1), then the first body is previous head (5,1), then the next is previous index 1 (4,1), then previous index 2 (4,2), ..., up to previous index 14 (4,4), but previous index 15 (5,4) removed, so the new body is from previous index 0 to 14 except index 0 is now head, so bodies: (5,1) from previous head, then previous bodies from index 1 to 14: (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4). Previous index 14 is (4,4), and index 15 (5,4) removed, so new positions: head (6,1), then (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), and (4,4) is tail?

No.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when moving to a cell without food, the head moves to the new cell, and the tail is removed, so the snake shortens by one segment?

Old positions: index 0: (5,1) head, 1: (4,1), 2: (4,2), 3: (4,3), 4: (3,3), 5: (2,3), 6: (1,3), 7: (1,4), 8: (1,5), 9: (2,5), 10: (2,6), 11: (3,6), 12: (4,6), 13: (4,5), 14: (4,4), 15: (5,4) tail.\n> \n> After move to (6,1) no food, new head at (6,1), then new body segments: old head position (5,1) becomes body, then old index 1 (4,1), old index 2 (4,2), old index 3 (4,3), old index 4 (3,3), ..., old index 14 (4,4), and the old tail index 15 (5,4) is removed. So the new positions are: head (6,1), then (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), and (4,4) is the last, so tail at (4,4). But (4,5) is also there; let's list: new index 0: head (6,1), index 1: (5,1), index 2: (4,1), index 3: (4,2), index 4: (4,3), index 5: (3,3), index 6: (2,3), index 7: (1,3), index 8: (1,4), index 9: (1,5), index 10: (2,5), index 11: (2,6), index 12: (3,6), index 13: (4,6), index 14: (4,5), index 15: (4,4) tail. But old index 14 is (4,4), old index 13 is (4,5), so new index 14 is old index 13 (4,5), new index 15 is old index 14 (4,4), and old index 15 removed.

So it disappears after 6 turns, including this one. Since current turn is 51, it will disappear after turn 56? Let me calculate: life span 6 means it has 6 turns left starting from now. So on turn 51, life span decreases to 5, then 4, etc., until turn 56 it disappears. But it says \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so at turn 51, life span is 6, meaning it has 6 turns including this one. So it can be eaten from turn 51 to 56, and disappears on turn 57? I need to clarify.\n> \n> The rule: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So at turn t, if life span is L, it decreases to L-1 on the next turn, and when it reaches 0, it disappears. So for food at (3,6) with life span 6 on turn 51:\n> \n> - Turn 51: life span 6\n> \n> - Turn 52: life span 5\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - Turn 56: life span 1\n> \n> - Turn 57: life span 0, disappears. So it can be eaten from turn 51 to 56 inclusive.\n> \n> Similarly, second food: (6,4), value 1, life span 8. So it appears on turn 51 with life span 8, decreases each turn, disappears on turn 59.\n> \n> Both foods are positive, value +1 each.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan actions for multiple turns ahead, at least 5 turns. The action sequence should start from turn 51.\n> \n> Current head position: (6,1), direction R (right). So possible moves: since head direction is R, I can move U (up), D (down), R (right), but not L (left) because that's opposite and no instant reverse. Rule: \"No instant reverse\": cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn. So from R, I can go U, D, R, but not L.\n> \n> Grid limits: walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? No: walls are at x=0 and x=7, so x=1 to 6 are safe? Let's see: \"Border cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7\" so cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls, so the playable area is x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? But y=1 to 6, and borders at y=0 and y=7, so y from 1 to 6 should be fine, similarly x from 1 to 6.\n> \n> But internal obstacle at (1,6), so (1,6) is blocked.\n> \n> Also, snake body: I need to avoid colliding with body except for the tail, which moves.\n> \n> First, let's map the snake positions:\n> \n> List of positions:\n> \n> 1.

Position 13 is (3,6), which is part of the body. Food at (3,6) is under the body? But according to the rule, food can spawn under the body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves onto it.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,4) is not occupied by snake; let's check snake positions: (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4). So (6,4) is free? x=6, y=4: (6,1) is there, but y=4, not listed, so (6,4) should be empty.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,6) is occupied by segment 13.\n> \n> Food at (3,6) is under the body, so it can be eaten only if that body part moves away and head comes there.\n> \n> Now, life span: food at (3,6) has life span 6, so it can be eaten until turn 56.\n> \n> Food at (6,4) has life span 8, until turn 58?

Is this safe? Not wall, not body? Walls: y=0 and y=7, so y=2 is fine. Body: is (6,2) occupied? Snake positions: all y=1 for head and next two, then (4,2), but (4,2) is at x=4, not x=6. (6,1) is head, (5,1), (4,1), etc. So (6,2) is not occupied. Also, no wall. So U to (6,2) is possible.\n> \n> - D: (6,1-1) = (6,0). But y=0 is wall, so collision, death. Cannot go D.\n> \n> - R: (6+1,1) = (7,1). x=7 is wall, so collision, death. Cannot go R.\n> \n> So only possible move is U, to (6,2).\n> \n> Is that right? Head at (6,1), direction R. Moving U to (6,2) is up, which is perpendicular, so allowed. D and R are invalid due to walls.\n> \n> R is to (7,1), which is x=7, wall. D to (6,0), y=0 wall. U to (6,2) is free? Let's confirm body: positions are listed, (6,2) not in the list. Grid: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, but (6,2) should be within bounds since y=2 not border.\n> \n> y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=1 to 6 are playable. Similarly x=1 to 6.\n> \n> Internal obstacle (1,6), but (6,2) is fine.\n> \n> So only possible move at turn 51 is U to (6,2).\n> \n> But I need to plan multiple turns.\n> \n> After moving U, the head direction changes to U.\n> \n> Then for turn 52, from (6,2), direction U.\n> \n> Possible moves: U, D, L, R?

Let's list the positions after turn 51 move.\n> \n> Initial positions: [(6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4)]\n> \n> After moving head to (6,2), the body shifts: the new positions are:\n> \n> Head: (6,2)\n> \n> Then the first body segment is the old head: (6,1)\n> \n> Then (5,1)\n> \n> Then (4,1)\n> \n> Then (4,2)\n> \n> Then (4,3)\n> \n> Then (3,3)\n> \n> Then (2,3)\n> \n> Then (1,3)\n> \n> Then (1,4)\n> \n> Then (1,5)\n> \n> Then (2,5)\n> \n> Then (2,6)\n> \n> Then (3,6)\n> \n> Then (4,6)\n> \n> Then (4,5)  // this was second last, now last but one? Positions: old tail was (4,4), which is removed. Old positions had 16 segments.

The food at (3,6) is ignored due to its short remaining lifespan (6 turns) and occupation by the body, making it impossible to reach and eat safely within the time frame while avoiding collisions. After eating, the snake moves upward to open space to ensure long-term survival.\n",

I need to be careful.\n> \n> Life span: it says \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So for food at (3,6), life span 5 on turn 52, so on turn 53 it will be 4, turn 54:3, turn 55:2, turn 56:1, turn 57:0 and disappears. So it can be eaten from turn 52 to 56 inclusive? Turn 52: life span 5, eaten; if not eaten, turn 53: life span 4, and so on, until turn 56: life span 1, then turn 57 it disappears.

Last move was Left (since I moved Left from (6,2) to (5,2)), so direction Left, so can't go Right (reverse). Also, Down to (5,1) is body, so only Up or Left possible? Down to (5,1): (5,1) is occupied by snake, so collision, invalid. So from (5,2), moves: Up to (5,3), Left to (4,2), or Right to (6,2) but reverse not allowed, so only Up or Left.\n> \n> (4,2) is occupied? Current positions: (4,2) is seg4, so if I go Left to (4,2), it's body, collision. So from (5,2), only safe move is Up to (5,3), since (5,3) is free.\n> \n> Positions: (5,3) not in list, so free.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,2) is occupied, so cannot go Left.\n> \n> So if I go Left on turn 52 to (5,2), then on turn 53, I can only go Up to (5,3) or Down to (5,1) but body, or Left to (4,2) body, or Right to (6,2) reverse, so only Up to (5,3) is safe.\n> \n> Then from (5,3), etc.\n> \n> But going Left on turn 52 might not be efficient for getting food.\n> \n> Prioritize eating (6,4) since it's close and easy.\n> \n> But let's think long-term.\n> \n> There is a danger with food at (3,6) because it's under body, and also tail reward danger if head adjacent to tail and tail has food.\n> \n> First, let's eat (6,4).\n> \n> On turn 52, move Up to (6,3).\n> \n> Then on turn 53, from (6,3), move Up to (6,4) and eat the food. Snake grows, so new segment added, length increases.\n> \n> After eating, positions: on turn 53, after moving to (6,4), head at (6,4), then the body: since food eaten, tail doesn't move, so segments: new head (6,4), then old head (6,3), then old seg1 (6,2), old seg2 (6,1), ..., up to old seg15 (4,6), and new tail is old tail (4,5)? When food eaten, the tail remains, and a new segment is added at the end.\n> \n> Standard snake: when food eaten, head moves to food, body follows, but tail stays, so length increases by one.\n> \n> So after moving to (6,4) and eating, snake positions: head (6,4), then (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), and (4,5) is still there?

It's turn 53, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since the borders are x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7. Walls are at the borders and there's an internal obstacle at (1,6).\n> \n> Snake positions: The head is at (6,3), and the direction is Up. The body segments follow: (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6). Let me list these out to visualize.\n> \n> Snake: Head (6,3), then (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6). So that's 16 segments? Let me count: positions from index 0 to 15, so 16 cells. Yes.\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (3,6) with value 1 and life span 4. But (3,6) is occupied by the snake's body? Snake positions include (3,6), which is the 15th segment (index 14 if head is 0). In the list, (3,6) is the second last position: positions are [ (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6) ]. So (3,6) is occupied by the snake body.\n> \n> But food at (3,6) is listed. According to the rules, food can spawn under the snake's body, but it can only be eaten if the body moves away and then the head moves onto it. So this food is under the snake body at (3,6).\n> \n> Similarly, other food: (6,4) with value 1, life span 6; and (3,1) with value 1, life span 9.\n> \n> All food has value +1, so all positive, no negative food mentioned.\n> \n> Now, head direction is Up, meaning last move was Up, so from (6,2) to (6,3), I assume? Snake positions: head at (6,3), previous was (6,2), so yes, moving Up.\n> \n> I need to plan at least 5 turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n> \n> First, let's map the grid. Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls at borders, so cells where x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Also internal obstacle at (1,6).\n> \n> So, cells to avoid: all border cells and (1,6).\n> \n> Now, snake head at (6,3), direction Up.\n> \n> Possible moves: I can move Up, Down, Left, Right, but cannot instantly reverse. Since direction is Up, reverse would be Down, so I cannot move Down next. So possible moves: Up, Left, Right. Down is not allowed because it would be instant reverse.\n> \n> Rule: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\"\n> \n> Current direction is Up, so opposite is Down, so cannot move Down on this turn.\n> \n> So for turn 53, I can choose U, L, or R.\n> \n> Now, let's see the food:\n> \n> - Food at (3,6): under snake body, life span 4. Since current turn is 53, it will disappear after 4 turns, meaning it will be gone by turn 57? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 53, life span 4, so it will be there for turns 53,54,55,56, and disappear at turn 57? Let's clarify.\n> \n> \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So for food at (3,6), life span 4 at turn 53. After turn 53, countdown becomes 3; after turn 54, countdown 2; after turn 55, countdown 1; after turn 56, countdown 0, so it disappears before turn 57. So it can be eaten from turn 53 to 56, but since it's under snake body, it can only be eaten if the snake moves away and head comes back.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (6,4): life span 6, so from turn 53 to 58 (since after 6 turns: turns 53,54,55,56,57,58, disappear at turn 59? Countdown: start 6 at turn 53, after t53:5, t54:4, t55:3, t56:2, t57:1, t58:0, gone at turn 59.\n> \n> And food at (3,1): life span 9, so last until turn 61 or so.\n> \n> But I need to think about accessing them.\n> \n> Also, there's a danger with tail: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it kills because tail grows and causes collision.\n> \n> First, let's find the tail.

Food at (6,4) with value +1.\n> \n> If I move Up to (6,4), I eat the food, snake grows, so new head at (6,4), and tail stays, so length becomes 17.\n> \n> But is it safe?

Therefore, the immediate priority is to eat the accessible positive food at (6,4) to increase score and length, then maneuver leftward and upward to avoid dead ends and position for future opportunities, such as the longer-lived food at (3,1). This sequence prioritizes survival by steering clear of the body and walls while setting up for long-term gains.\n",

It's turn 54, and I'm the snake AI. The grid has walls: border cells where x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7 are walls, and there's an internal obstacle at (1,6). So the grid is 8x8? Since x from 0 to 7 and y from 0 to 7, that's 8 cells in each direction, but the borders are walls, so the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6)? Let's confirm.\n> \n> x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x-coordinates from 1 to 6 are playable? Similarly for y: y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y from 1 to 6. But there's an internal obstacle at (1,6), which is on the border? y=6 is not a wall border since walls are y=0 and y=7, so y=6 is playable. Walls are only at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So playable grid is x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? x=1 to x=6, that's 6 cells, similarly y=1 to y=6, 6x6 grid? But positions include (6,4), etc., and food at (3,6), which has y=6. Since y=7 is wall, y=6 should be playable. Similarly, (1,6) is given as internal obstacle, so it's blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (6,4), and direction is U (up). So current head direction is up, meaning last move was up.\n> \n> Snake body: [(6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6)]\n> \n> Let me list the positions in order:\n> \n> - Head: (6,4)\n> \n> - Then (6,3) - one down\n> \n> - (6,2) - down\n> \n> - (6,1) - down\n> \n> - (5,1) - left\n> \n> - (4,1) - left\n> \n> - (4,2) - up\n> \n> - (4,3) - up\n> \n> - (3,3) - left\n> \n> - (2,3) - left\n> \n> - (1,3) - left? From (2,3) to (1,3) is left.\n> \n> - (1,4) - up\n> \n> - (1,5) - up\n> \n> - (2,5) - right\n> \n> - (2,6) - up\n> \n> - (3,6) - right\n> \n> - (4,6) - right, and this is the tail? Positions have 17 segments? Let's count: from index 0 to 16, that's 17 positions. Head at (6,4), tail at (4,6).\n> \n> Now, food:\n> \n> - (3,6) with value 1 and life span 3\n> \n> - (3,1) with value 1 and life span 8\n> \n> Both are positive food since value is +1.\n> \n> Life span: for (3,6), it disappears after 3 turns, including current turn? Life span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 54, life span is 3, meaning it will disappear after turn 56? Let's see: if life span is N at turn t, it decreases each turn, so after N turns, it disappears. At turn t, life span is N, so after turn t, it becomes N-1; at turn t+1, it becomes N-2, ..., at turn t + N-1, it becomes 1, and at turn t + N, it becomes 0 and disappears. But since it can be eaten only when head moves onto it, and life span decreases at the end of turn or something? The countdown decreases every turn, including current, so if life span is 3 at turn 54, it means:\n> \n> - Turn 54: life span 3\n> \n> - After turn 54, life span becomes 2 for turn 55\n> \n> - After turn 55, life span becomes 1 for turn 56\n> \n> - After turn 56, life span becomes 0 and disappears, so it can be eaten up to turn 56? At the start of turn 56, life span is 1, and after the turn, it becomes 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten during turn 56 if head moves to it.\n> \n> Similarly, for (3,1), life span 8 at turn 54, so it will last until turn 61 or so.\n> \n> Now, the snake head is at (6,4), direction U. So from (6,4), moving up would go to (6,5).\n> \n> But we need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> First, let's map the grid.\n> \n> Playable area: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except internal obstacle at (1,6).\n> \n> So walls: all cells where x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and (1,6).\n> \n> (1,6) is occupied by wall, so not accessible.\n> \n> Now, snake body: let's list all occupied cells to avoid collisions.\n> \n> Snake positions:\n> \n> (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6)\n> \n> (2,6) is at y=6, which is not wall, but (1,6) is obstacle, so (2,6) is fine.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,6) and (4,6) are at y=6.\n> \n> Food at (3,6) and (3,1).\n> \n> (3,6) has food, but (3,6) is also occupied by the snake's body? Snake positions include (3,6)? Let's see: positions are (6,4) head, then ... (2,6), (3,6), (4,6) tail. So (3,6) is a body segment, specifically the 15th segment? Indices: 0: (6,4), 1: (6,3), 2: (6,2), 3: (6,1), 4: (5,1), 5: (4,1), 6: (4,2), 7: (4,3), 8: (3,3), 9: (2,3), 10: (1,3), 11: (1,4), 12: (1,5), 13: (2,5), 14: (2,6), 15: (3,6), 16: (4,6)\n> \n> So (3,6) is position 15, which is not the tail; tail is (4,6). And there is food at (3,6), but it's under the snake's body.\n> \n> According to the rules, food can spawn under the body but can only be eaten if the body moves away and then head moves onto it.\n> \n> So for (3,6), since it's occupied, I can't eat it now. I need to move so that the body leaves (3,6), then later head can come back to eat it.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (3,1) is not occupied, I think. Snake has (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), but not (3,1). (3,1) is free? Cells: (4,1) is snake, (5,1) snake, (6,1) snake, (3,1) is not listed, so probably free, and has food.\n> \n> Now, current head position (6,4), direction U, so I can move U, D, L, R, but with no instant reverse. Since direction is U, reverse is D, so I cannot move D immediately. Possible moves: U, L, R. Not D.\n> \n> Moving U to (6,5)\n> \n> L to (5,4)\n> \n> R to (7,4) but x=7 is wall, so invalid.\n> \n> x=7 is wall, so from (6,4), moving R to (7,4) is wall, not possible.\n> \n> Similarly, moving U to (6,5): y=5, which is within 1-6, and not wall.\n> \n> Moving L to (5,4): x=5, y=4, should be free? Need to check if occupied by body.\n> \n> Body cells: (6,4) head, (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6)\n> \n> So (5,4) is not in this list, so it should be free.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,5) not in list, free.\n> \n> (7,4) wall, invalid.\n> \n> (6,3) is body, moving D to (6,3) would be collision, but since direction is U, I cannot move D anyway because of no reverse.\n> \n> So possible moves: U to (6,5), L to (5,4), or R invalid, so only U and L possible? R is to (7,4) wall, so not possible. So from (6,4), only U or L.\n> \n> Now, I need to think about the food and plan ahead.\n> \n> Food at (3,6) with life span 3, meaning it will disappear after turn 56 (since at turn 54:3, turn 55:2, turn 56:1, after turn 56 gone).\n> \n> Similarly, food at (3,1) with life span 8, so it will last until after turn 61 or something.\n> \n> But (3,6) is currently under the snake body at position (3,6). To eat it, I need to move the body away from (3,6), then bring head there.\n> \n> When the snake moves, the tail moves, so if I move, the tail will move away from (4,6), but (3,6) is not tail, it's a middle segment.\n> \n> The segment at (3,6) will move when the snake moves. Depending on the path.\n> \n> Let's think about the snake's movement.\n> \n> Current head (6,4), direction U.\n> \n> If I move U to (6,5), then new head (6,5), body: (6,5) head, then (6,4), (6,3), ..., and tail (4,6) moves? When head moves to a new cell, the tail end is removed, so the segment at (4,6) is removed, and a new segment is added at head position if no food eaten, but since no food eaten, tail moves.\n> \n> After moving U to (6,5): new positions: head (6,5), then (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6) and tail is now (3,6)? Let's see: the last segment was (4,6), which is removed, so the new body is from index 1 to 16 minus the last, but with head added.\n> \n> Original positions: 0:(6,4), 1:(6,3), 2:(6,2), 3:(6,1), 4:(5,1), 5:(4,1), 6:(4,2), 7:(4,3), 8:(3,3), 9:(2,3), 10:(1,3), 11:(1,4), 12:(1,5), 13:(2,5), 14:(2,6), 15:(3,6), 16:(4,6)\n> \n> After moving U, head to (6,5), so new head (6,5), then the body segments from old 0 to 15: (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6) — and the tail old (4,6) is gone. So now the snake has 17 segments? No, when moving without eating, the snake length stays the same, so tail is removed.\n> \n> Original length 17 cells. After move, head moves to new position, and tail is removed, so new positions: [ (6,5) ] + positions[0] to [15] , which is (6,4) to (3,6), so from index 0 to 15, that's 16 cells, plus new head, 17 cells? Positions[0] is old head, which becomes new position 1, up to positions[15] which is (3,6), and positions[16] is removed.\n> \n> So new snake: head at (6,5), then old head (6,4), then (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6) — that's 17 positions, but (3,6) is now the tail.\n> \n> Positions: 0: (6,5) new head, 1: (6,4) old head, 2: (6,3), 3: (6,2), 4: (6,1), 5: (5,1), 6: (4,1), 7: (4,2), 8: (4,3), 9: (3,3), 10: (2,3), 11: (1,3), 12: (1,4), 13: (1,5), 14: (2,5), 15: (2,6), 16: (3,6) new tail.\n> \n> Yes, tail is now at (3,6).\n> \n> But there is food at (3,6), and now the tail is at (3,6), so the food is under the tail.\n> \n> If I want to eat the food at (3,6), I need the head to move to (3,6) when it's free.\n> \n> But now after this move, (3,6) is occupied by tail, so not free.\n> \n> Similarly, if I move L instead to (5,4).\n> \n> From (6,4) move L to (5,4), direction was U, but moving L is not reverse, so ok.\n> \n> New head (5,4), then body: old head (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6) and tail (4,6) removed.\n> \n> So new positions: head (5,4), then (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6) tail.\n> \n> Again, (3,6) is tail.\n> \n> In both cases, after one move, (3,6) becomes the tail.\n> \n> But there is food at (3,6), so if I move such that the head goes to (3,6) when it's the tail, I can eat it, but there's a danger: Tail Reward Danger.\n> \n> If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because after eating, the tail grows, so the new tail is at the old tail position, and head is there, so collision.\n> \n> Specifically: if head moves to a cell that has food and is the current tail position, then after eating, the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move, and head is on the food cell, which was tail, so now head and tail are on same cell?

When the snake moves forward without eating, the tail will move to where the second last segment was, which is (2,6). So from positions, index 15 is (2,6), index 16 is (3,6). When moving, if no food eaten, the new tail will be at (2,6), and (3,6) is vacated.\n> \n> But there is food at (3,6), so if we move and don't eat, the tail moves to (2,6), and (3,6) is empty, but food is there, so it becomes exposed.\n> \n> Then, on subsequent turns, head can move to (3,6) to eat it.\n> \n> But life span is short, only 2 turns including current? At turn 55, life span 2.\n> \n> After turn 55, it decreases to 1.

Rule says: if head moves to a cell with body, it collides, except if it's the tail and tail moves away, but at the same time, it's ambiguous.\n> \n> The collision rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So it is possible to move to the tail position because the tail moves away simultaneously.\n> \n> But there's a special case for food: \"Tail Reward Danger: If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n> \n> In this case, head is at (5,4), tail at (3,6).

So not adjacent.\n> \n> Therefore, moving to tail might be safe.\n> \n> But let's see the positions: head (5,4), to move to (3,6) directly?

Let's list:\n> \n> After move, head to new position, then each subsequent segment takes the previous position of the segment before it.\n> \n> So:\n> \n> - New head: (4,4)  // if moved left\n> \n> - Then segment 1: old head position (5,4)\n> \n> - Segment 2: old segment 1 position (6,4)\n> \n> - Segment 3: old segment 2 position (6,3)\n> \n> - Segment 4: old segment 3 position (6,2)\n> \n> Old segment 3 is (6,2), which had food under it? Position (6,2) is occupied, but when the segment moves away, to where? After move, segment 4 will be at old segment 3 position, which is (6,2).\n> \n> Old positions: segment 0: (5,4), seg1: (6,4), seg2: (6,3), seg3: (6,2), seg4: (6,1), etc.\n> \n> After moving head to (4,4):\n> \n> - New head: (4,4)\n> \n> - New seg1: old head (5,4)\n> \n> - New seg2: old seg1 (6,4)\n> \n> - New seg3: old seg2 (6,3)\n> \n> - New seg4: old seg3 (6,2)  // so (6,2) is still occupied by new seg4\n> \n> - New seg5: old seg4 (6,1)\n> \n> - And so on.\n> \n> The position (6,2) is now occupied by new seg4, which was old seg3. But the food is at (6,2), and it's still under the body, not exposed.\n> \n> To expose (6,2), we need the segment that is there to move away. But since the snake is moving, each turn the segments shift, but the cell (6,2) might be occupied by different segments.\n> \n> In this case, after the move, (6,2) is occupied by new seg4. On the next move, if we move again without eating, new seg4 will move to where new seg5 was, which is (6,1), so (6,2) is vacated? Let's see.\n> \n> After turn 55, positions: head (4,4), seg1 (5,4), seg2 (6,4), seg3 (6,3), seg4 (6,2), seg5 (6,1), etc.\n> \n> Now turn 56, if we move, say head to (4,5) or something.\n> \n> New head to new position, say (4,5) if up.\n> \n> Then new seg1: old head (4,4)\n> \n> New seg2: old seg1 (5,4)\n> \n> New seg3: old seg2 (6,4)\n> \n> New seg4: old seg3 (6,3)\n> \n> New seg5: old seg4 (6,2)  // (6,2) is now occupied by new seg5\n> \n> Still occupied.\n> \n> The segment at (6,2) is moving to the next position each time, but the cell is only vacated when the tail moves away from it, but here (6,2) is not the tail.\n> \n> The cell (6,2) will be vacated when the segment that was there moves to another position, and no new segment comes, but since the snake is contiguous, when the snake moves forward, the cell that was occupied by the last body segment (before tail) is vacated if no growth.\n> \n> In general, for a body segment not the tail, when the snake moves, that cell is left empty if it was the end, but here (6,2) is in the middle.\n> \n> The only cell vacated each turn is the previous tail position, if no food eaten.\n> \n> In this case, the tail is at (3,6), so when snake moves without eating, tail moves to (2,6), and (3,6) is vacated.\n> \n> For (6,2), it is occupied by a body segment, and when that segment moves, the cell is immediately occupied by the next segment or something? No.\n> \n> When the snake moves, all segments shift: the head moves to a new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment in the chain, so the cell that was occupied by the tail is left empty.\n> \n> Other cells are not necessarily vacated; they are just occupied by different segments.\n> \n> For example, position (6,2) is currently occupied by seg3. After move, seg3 moves to where seg2 was, which is (6,3), so (6,2) is no longer occupied by seg3, but now seg4 moves to (6,2), so (6,2) is still occupied, just by a different segment.\n> \n> So the cell (6,2) remains occupied unless the segment that is there moves and no other segment takes its place, which only happens for the tail cell.\n> \n> Therefore, for a food under a body segment that is not the tail, it will never be exposed because the cell is always occupied by some part of the snake until the snake moves away from that area or something, but in this case, since the snake is long and coiled, it might stay occupied.\n> \n> Specifically for (6,2), it is part of the body, and as the snake moves, different segments occupy it, but the cell itself is always filled.\n> \n> To expose the food at (6,2), we need the snake to move in such a way that no segment is at (6,2) after some move.\n> \n> That means the segment that was at (6,2) must move, and the next segment not move to it, which only happens if that position is not the immediate next, but in the shifting, it's always covered.\n> \n> The only way to vacate (6,2) is if the snake grows or the tail passes through it, but it's complicated.\n> \n> Since the food is under the body, and the body is moving, but the cell is constantly occupied, so the food can only be eaten if the head moves to it at the exact moment when it is exposed, but it never is exposed because some segment is always there.\n> \n> But that can't be right; there must be a way.\n> \n> Perhaps if the snake changes direction, the body moves away.\n> \n> For example, if the head moves in a way that the segment at (6,2) moves and the position is not immediately filled, but in the standard Snake movement, when the snake moves, all segments shift simultaneously, so the cell that was occupied by the last segment (tail) is vacated, but other cells may be vacated if the snake turns, but in terms of occupancy, after the move, the new positions are set.\n> \n> Let's think: at turn 55, position (6,2) is occupied.\n> \n> After a move, the segment that was at (6,2) moves to a new position, say to (6,3) or whatever, and the cell (6,2) is now free, but at the same time, the segment that was behind moves to (6,2), so it is immediately reoccupied.\n> \n> For instance, in the move I described, seg3 was at (6,2), after move, it moves to (6,3), and seg4 moves to (6,2), so (6,2) is now occupied by seg4.\n> \n> So the cell is never empty; it's always under the body.\n> \n> The only cell that can be vacated is the tail position when the snake moves without eating.\n> \n> For food under a non-tail body segment, it can only be eaten if that segment is the tail at some point, or if the snake shortens, but here no negative food, so snake only grows or stays same length.\n> \n> Since no eating, snake stays same length, so the body segment at (6,2) will always be occupied until the snake moves in a way that the tail passes through it or something, but it's not the tail.\n> \n> In this case, for (6,2), it is not the tail, and the tail is far away, so it may take many moves for that cell to be vacated, if ever.\n> \n> Specifically, the food at (6,2) has life span 10, so it might disappear before we can eat it.\n> \n> But to eat it, we need to have the head move to (6,2) when it is not occupied, which requires that the snake has moved away from that area or the tail has passed.\n> \n> But it's messy.\n> \n> Perhaps for simplicity, since the food is under the body, and the body is dense, it might not be feasible to eat it soon.\n> \n> Similarly for (3,6), it is under tail, so it can be exposed when tail moves.\n> \n> So let's focus on (3,6) first, as it has short life span.\n> \n> Life span 2 at turn 55, so we can eat it on turn 56 if we expose it on turn 55.\n> \n> Plan for turn 55 and 56.\n> \n> Current head at (5,4), direction L.\n> \n> We need to move such that on turn 56, head can move to (3,6).\n> \n> First, on turn 55, we move to a position that is adjacent to (3,6), so that on turn 56 we can move to (3,6).\n> \n> (3,6) neighbors: (2,6), (4,6), (3,5), (3,7) but y=7 wall, so (2,6), (4,6), (3,5).\n> \n> (2,6) is currently occupied by the second last segment, which will be the new tail after move.\n> \n> After turn 55 move, tail moves to (2,6), so (2,6) is occupied.\n> \n> (4,6) and (3,5) are free.\n> \n> So head needs to be at (4,6) or (3,5) on turn 56 to move to (3,6).\n> \n> But on turn 56, after turn 55 move.\n> \n> First, on turn 55, we move from (5,4) to some place.\n> \n> Possible moves: L to (4,4), U to (5,5), D to (5,3).\n> \n> From (4,4), we can go to (4,5), (4,3), (3,4), (5,4) but (5,4) is body after move, not good.\n> \n> From (5,5), to (5,6), (5,4), (6,5), (4,5)\n> \n> From (5,3), to (5,4), (5,2), (6,3), (4,3)\n> \n> We need to reach (4,6) or (3,5) by turn 56.\n> \n> (4,6) is at x=4,y=6\n> \n> (3,5) at x=3,y=5\n> \n> From current (5,4), to reach (4,6) in one move?

Walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so cells from x=1 to x=6 and y=1 to y=6 are playable, but there's an internal obstacle at (1,6), so that cell is blocked.\n> \n> Snake positions: Head at (5,5), then (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6).

At turn t, if life_span is L, it will disappear after L turns, meaning it can be eaten on turns from t to t+L-1. For example, if food has life_span 1 at turn t, it can be eaten only on turn t.

It's under the body at (6,2), which is the 5th segment. When the snake moves, the body will move, so after a few moves, (6,2) might be free if the snake moves away.\n> \n> Currently, the segment at (6,2) is the 5th, so when the snake moves, the tail moves forward, so the body at (6,2) will move to the next position.\n> \n> Let's see the snake body order: indices from head: 0: (5,5), 1: (5,4), 2: (6,4), 3: (6,3), 4: (6,2), 5: (6,1), 6: (5,1), etc.\n> \n> When the snake moves, the head moves to a new position, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment in front, and the tail segment is removed if no food eaten.\n> \n> Since no food eaten yet, when the snake moves, the tail moves away from (2,6), and the body at (6,2) will move to where (6,3) was or something.\n> \n> Let's simulate one move.\n> \n> At turn 56, before move, head at (5,5), tail at (2,6).\n> \n> If I move, say, U to (5,6), then new head at (5,6), new body: segment 1: old head (5,5), segment 2: old segment 1 (5,4), segment 3: old segment 2 (6,4), and so on, down to segment 16: old segment 15 (1,5), and tail old segment 16 (2,6)? Let's index properly.\n> \n> Positions list: index 0: head (5,5), index 1: (5,4), index 2: (6,4), index 3: (6,3), index 4: (6,2), index 5: (6,1), index 6: (5,1), index 7: (4,1), index 8: (4,2), index 9: (4,3), index 10: (3,3), index 11: (2,3), index 12: (1,3), index 13: (1,4), index 14: (1,5), index 15: (2,5), index 16: tail (2,6)\n> \n> After moving head to new position, new positions: new index 0: new head position, say (5,6) if moved U.\n> \n> Then index 1: old index 0 (5,5)\n> \n> index 2: old index 1 (5,4)\n> \n> index 3: old index 2 (6,4)\n> \n> index 4: old index 3 (6,3)\n> \n> index 5: old index 4 (6,2)  -- old (6,2) moves to old (6,3)? No.\n> \n> When the head moves to a new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> So after moving head to (5,6), the new position 1 is the old head (5,5), position 2 is old position 1 (5,4), position 3 is old position 2 (6,4), position 4 is old position 3 (6,3), position 5 is old position 4 (6,2), position 6 is old position 5 (6,1), and so on, up to position 16 is old position 15 (2,5), and the tail position 16 is new, but since no food, the tail is removed, so the new snake has 17 segments, but the last segment (old tail (2,6)) is removed, so new positions: head (5,6), then (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5) -- 17 segments? Old positions had 17, after move, head new, tail removed, so still 17 segments? Let's count: old positions 17 cells. After move: new head, and the body from old head to old second last, so 16 body segments? No.\n> \n> Standard snake: when moving without eating, the head moves to a new cell, each subsequent segment moves to the position of the previous segment, and the tail cell is vacated.\n> \n> So the number of segments remains the same, but the tail position changes.\n> \n> In this case, before move: 17 positions.\n> \n> After moving head to new cell, the new body is: new head, then old head, then old body1, ..., up to old body15, and the tail is old body16? Indices: let's say positions S[0] to S[16], S[0] head, S[16] tail.\n> \n> After move to new head position H_new, the new positions are: H_new, S[0], S[1], S[2], ..., S[15]. S[16] is removed.\n> \n> So new positions: 17 segments, from H_new, S[0], S[1], ..., S[15].\n> \n> S[15] is the new tail, which was the old S[15].\n> \n> In this case, old S[15] is (2,5), index 15 is (2,5), index 16 is (2,6) tail.\n> \n> After move, new head, say (5,6), then new S[1] = old S[0] = (5,5), new S[2] = old S[1] = (5,4), new S[3] = old S[2] = (6,4), new S[4] = old S[3] = (6,3), new S[5] = old S[4] = (6,2), new S[6] = old S[5] = (6,1), and so on, up to new S[16] = old S[15] = (2,5).\n> \n> Old tail (2,6) is gone.\n> \n> So for the food at (6,2), which was under old S[4], after this move, if I move the head, the segment at (6,2) will move to (6,3) if the head moves, but the cell (6,2) might be vacated or not.\n> \n> In the new positions, new S[5] is at (6,2) if I didn't eat food, but after moving, the body segment that was at (6,2) is now at new position, so the cell (6,2) is free only if no segment is there.\n> \n> After move, the new positions: for example, if I move U to (5,6), new head (5,6), then S[1] (5,5), S[2] (5,4), S[3] (6,4), S[4] (6,3), S[5] (6,2), S[6] (6,1), etc. So S[5] is at (6,2), so the food is still under the body at (6,2), now occupied by new S[5].\n> \n> Similarly, if I move in other directions, it might still be occupied.\n> \n> To free (6,2), I need the snake to move so that the body leaves that cell and no segment is there.\n> \n> Currently, (6,2) is occupied by a body segment. When the snake moves, that segment moves to the next position, so the cell (6,2) is vacated only if no new segment moves to it.\n> \n> But when the head moves, the tail moves, so the cell of the tail is vacated, but (6,2) is not the tail.\n> \n> For (6,2) to be free, the segment that is there must move away, and no other segment moves to it.\n> \n> For example, if the snake moves in a way that the body at (6,2) moves to another cell, and no segment comes to (6,2), then it is free.\n> \n> Since the body is connected, it's tricky.\n> \n> The cell (6,2) will be free when the segment that was there moves to a different cell and the new position is not filled by another segment immediately.\n> \n> In this case, the segment at (6,2) is S[4], which will move to the position of S[3] when the head moves, but S[3] is (6,3), so if head moves, S[4] moves to (6,3), and S[5] moves to (6,2), so (6,2) is still occupied by S[5] now.\n> \n> Similarly, it stays occupied unless the snake eats food and grows, or the tail moves away.\n> \n> Since the tail is at (2,6), and it's moving, eventually if the snake moves, the position (6,2) might be vacated when the segment that was there is no longer part of the snake, but it takes many moves.\n> \n> For example, the distance from head to the segment at (6,2) is 4 segments away, so to vacate (6,2), I need to move the snake so that after 4 moves, the tail has moved, but it's messy.\n> \n> A better way: the cell (6,2) will be free when the tail has moved enough that the segment that was at (6,2) has become the tail and moved away.\n> \n> Currently, (6,2) is S[4], which is the 5th segment. The tail is S[16], so there are 12 segments after it. So after 12 moves, S[4] will be the tail, and when it moves, (6,2) will be vacated if the tail moves away.\n> \n> But when the tail moves, the cell is vacated.\n> \n> Let's think: after k moves, the segment that was at position i will be at position i-k if i-k >=0, but it's better not to think in indices.\n> \n> The cell (6,2) is currently occupied by a body segment. It will remain occupied until that segment moves away and no segment replaces it, but since the snake is moving, the occupation shifts.\n> \n> The cell (6,2) will be free when the tail passes through it or something, but it's not necessarily.\n> \n> To have (6,2) free, I need the snake to have moved enough that the segment at (6,2) has been the tail and moved on.\n> \n> Since the segment at (6,2) is the 5th segment, and there are 17 segments, after 12 moves, it will be the 17th segment, the tail. Then on the next move, when the tail moves, (6,2) is vacated.\n> \n> But during those moves, the snake is moving, so the position changes.\n> \n> For example, if I keep moving in a certain direction, the segment at (6,2) will move to different cells.\n> \n> But eventually, after many moves, the cell (6,2) might be free.\n> \n> But with life_span 9, I have time, so I can plan to free it later.\n> \n> For now, I should focus on (3,1) which is available and not under body.\n> \n> So let's go for (3,1).\n> \n> From (5,5) to (3,1), shortest path: for example, move L to (4,5), then D to (4,4), but (4,4) is free?

But (6,2) is currently occupied by a body segment of the snake.\n> \n> According to the rules: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> So, since the body is on it now, the snake can't eat it immediately; the body must move away first, then head can move onto it later.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,1) is not occupied by snake; let's see where it is. (3,1): snake positions are mostly above y=1, except (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), etc., but (3,1) not listed, so it's free, but has food.\n> \n> Now, life span: (3,1) life 6, so after turn 57, it will be 5, then 4, etc., disappearing after turn 62.\n> \n> (6,2) life 8, so after turn 57, life 7, then down to 0 after turn 64.\n> \n> But (6,2) is occupied now, so to eat it, the body must move away.\n> \n> The snake moves, so each turn, the tail moves, and if it eats food, it grows.\n> \n> Current snake length: positions list has 17 segments? Let's count: from head to tail: (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5) — that's 17 positions, so length 17.\n> \n> Index: 1: (4,5), 2: (5,5), 3: (5,4), 4: (6,4), 5: (6,3), 6: (6,2), 7: (6,1), 8: (5,1), 9: (4,1), 10: (4,2), 11: (4,3), 12: (3,3), 13: (2,3), 14: (1,3), 15: (1,4), 16: (1,5), 17: (2,5) — yes, 17 segments.\n> \n> Now, food at (6,2): (6,2) is the 6th segment, so when the snake moves, that segment will move, and if the head moves to (6,2) later, it can eat the food, but only if the body has moved away first.\n> \n> Similarly, for (3,1), it's free now.\n> \n> But (3,1) has life span 6, meaning it will be there for 6 more turns including this one? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 57, life span is 6, so it exists on turns 57,58,59,60,61, and disappears after turn 62? Let's clarify.\n> \n> The food is present as long as life span > 0. At turn t, with life span L, it will be there for L turns, including turn t. So from turn t to t+L-1, it exists, and disappears at turn t+L.\n> \n> For (3,1): life span 6 at turn 57, so it exists on turns 57,58,59,60,61,62? Turn 57: life span 6, after turn 57, it decreases to 5, so at start of turn 58, life span 5, and so on. At start of turn 57, life span 6, so it can be eaten on turn 57 if head moves there. After eating, it's gone, but if not eaten, it remains until life span reaches 0.\n> \n> Typically, life span decreases at the end of the turn or beginning? The rule says: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> And \"Disappears after N turns\", so I think at the end of each turn, life span decreases by 1.\n> \n> But for the purpose of being eaten, on turn t, if head moves to food, it is eaten, and food is removed.\n> \n> Then, at the end of the turn, for remaining food, life span decreases.\n> \n> If life span was 1, after decreasing to 0, it disappears.\n> \n> So for (3,1) at turn 57, life span 6, so it can be eaten on turns 57 to 62? From turn 57 to 62, that's 6 turns: 57,58,59,60,61,62.\n> \n> At turn 57, life span 6, eaten on 57, life becomes 5 after, but since eaten, it's gone. If not eaten, after turn 57, life span 5, and so on, until after turn 62, if not eaten, life span would be 0, so it disappears.\n> \n> Similarly for (6,2), life span 8, exists from turn 57 to 64.\n> \n> Now, back to possible moves for turn 57.\n> \n> Head at (4,5), direction L.\n> \n> Possible actions: L to (3,5), U to (4,6), D to (4,4).\n> \n> I need to evaluate each option, thinking 5+ turns ahead.\n> \n> First, let's see the grid layout.\n> \n> Walls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 walls.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (1,6).\n> \n> Snake occupies many cells.\n> \n> Food at (3,1) and (6,2) but (6,2) is occupied, so not accessible until body moves.\n> \n> (3,1) is free.\n> \n> Now, (3,1) is at bottom left, but let's see coordinates.\n> \n> x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n> \n> (3,1) is x=3,y=1.\n> \n> From head (4,5), to reach (3,1), it's down and left, but with obstacles.\n> \n> First, let's consider moving to (3,5).\n> \n> (3,5) is free, not wall, not snake.\n> \n> From (3,5), what can I do next?\n> \n> Similarly, (4,6) up, (4,4) down.\n> \n> Also, there's a risk with the tail.\n> \n> Tail is at (2,5), which is adjacent to head?

Then new head (2,5), segment 1 moves to (3,5), segment 2 to (4,5), segment 3 to (5,5), segment 4 to (5,4), segment 5 to (6,4), segment 6 to (6,3), segment 7 to (6,2)? Segment 6 was at (6,2), after move, segment 6 moves to where segment 5 was? Let's think.\n> \n> When head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> \n> So, after head moves to new position, say P_new.\n> \n> Then, the segment that was at position i moves to position i-1 for i=1 to len-1, and tail (last) is removed if no food.\n> \n> So, for cell (6,2): currently occupied by segment 6.\n> \n> After one move, if head moves and no food eaten, segment 6 will move to where segment 5 was, which is (6,3), since segment 5 is at (6,3).\n> \n> Segment 5: (6,3), segment 6: (6,2), so when segment 5 moves to where segment 4 was? Segment 4 is at (6,4), so segment 5 moves to (6,4), segment 6 moves to where segment 5 was, (6,3).\n> \n> Then the cell (6,2) is now occupied by segment 7, which was at (6,1)? Segment 7 is at (6,1), moves to (6,2).\n> \n> Let's clarify:\n> \n> After head moves to new cell, the new body segments are:\n> \n> - New position 0: new head position\n> \n> - Position 1: old position 0 (where head was)\n> \n> - Position 2: old position 1\n> \n> - ...\n> - Position k: old position k-1 for k from 1 to len-1\n> \n> - Then the tail (old position len-1) is removed, so that cell is free if not occupied.\n> \n> In this case, for cell (6,2), it was old position of segment 6.\n> \n> After move, segment 6 is now at the position where segment 5 was, which is (6,3), so (6,2) is now occupied by the segment that was at old position 7, which was (6,1), so segment 7 moves to (6,2).\n> \n> Similarly, the cell (6,2) is still occupied by the body, but by a different segment.\n> \n> To vacate (6,2), it needs to be the tail position, and when the snake moves without eating, the tail moves away.\n> \n> Currently, tail is at (1,5), far away.\n> \n> The segment at (6,2) is not tail, so as long as the snake is moving, that cell will be occupied by some body segment until the tail passes through, which will take many turns.\n> \n> The food at (6,2) has life span 7, so it will disappear in 7 turns if not eaten.\n> \n> To eat it, the snake needs to have (6,2) free and head move to it.\n> \n> But since it's under body, it will only be free when the tail moves away from it, but the tail is at (1,5), and the path is long, so it might take time to vacate.\n> \n> Perhaps I can move in a way that the body shifts faster.\n> \n> But let's estimate how many turns to vacate (6,2).\n> \n> The tail is at (1,5), and the snake is coiled, so it's not a straight path.\n> \n> From tail to (6,2): the segment at (6,2) is position 6, tail is position 16, so there are 10 segments after it, so it will take at least 10 moves for the tail to reach near there, but since the snake is not straight, it might take more turns to free that cell.\n> \n> For example, the cell (6,2) will be occupied until the segment that is currently at position 16 (tail) moves to it, but as the snake moves, the indices change.\n> \n> The distance in terms of segments: from head to (6,2) is 6 segments away, but to free the cell, the tail needs to be at that position and move away.\n> \n> The tail is currently 16 segments from head, so it will take about 16 moves for the tail to be where the head is now, but the head moves, so it's dynamic.\n> \n> In general, for a cell occupied by a body segment not tail, it will be freed in approximately the number of segments from that point to the tail moves.\n> \n> Here, from (6,2) to tail: the segment at (6,2) is 6th from head, tail is 16th, so 10 segments after, so it will take at least 10 moves for that cell to be vacated, assuming the snake moves in a way that the tail follows directly, but in this case, the snake is turning, so it might take more.\n> \n> For example, the tail is at (1,5), and to move to (6,2), it has to go through the body path.\n> \n> The body path from tail to (6,2): tail (1,5) to (1,4) to (1,3) to (2,3) to (3,3) to (4,3) to (4,2) to (4,1) to (5,1) to (6,1) to (6,2), so it's a path of 10 segments from tail to (6,2), I think.\n> \n> From tail (1,5) to (1,4) to (1,3) to (2,3) to (3,3) to (4,3) to (4,2) to (4,1) to (5,1) to (6,1) to (6,2), so 10 segments, but (6,2) is included, so to move the tail to (6,2), it takes moving the snake 10 times, then on the 11th move, if no food eaten, the tail moves away and (6,2) is free.\n> \n> But during this, if the snake eats food, the tail doesn't move, so it takes longer.\n> \n> But in this case, food at (6,2) has life 7, which is less than 10, so by the time the tail could reach, the food might have disappeared. Life span 7 at turn 58, so it disappears after turn 58 + 7 - 1? Life span decreases each turn including current.\n> \n> Life span N: disappears after N turns, meaning on turn t + N, it's gone.\n> \n> \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So at turn t, life span L, it will disappear at turn t + L.\n> \n> For example, at turn 58, life span 5 for (3,1), so it will be there until turn 58 + 5 - 1? Let's see.\n> \n> \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So at turn t, countdown is L, at turn t+1, it is L-1, ..., at turn t + L - 1, countdown 1, at turn t + L, it disappears, so last chance to eat is turn t + L - 1.\n> \n> For food at (6,2): life span 7 at turn 58, so countdown: turn 58: 7, turn 59:6, ..., turn 64:1, turn 65: disappears. So can be eaten from turn 58 to 64.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,1): life 5, turn 58:5, turn 59:4, turn 60:3, turn 61:2, turn 62:1, turn 63: disappears. Eat by turn 62.\n> \n> (1,2): life 10, turn 58:10, eat by turn 67.\n> \n> To eat (6,2), it needs to be free and head move to it. But it's currently under body, and as we saw, it might take 10 or more turns to free it, but life only 7 turns left, so it's impossible to eat (6,2) because by the time it could be free, food is gone.\n> \n> The cell (6,2) is occupied by a body segment, and it will only be free when the tail moves away from it, but the tail is far, and with life span 7, it can't be freed in time. Even if the snake moves directly towards it, the head is at (3,5), (6,2) is 3 units away in x and 3 in y, so Manhattan distance 6, but the body is in the way, so head can't reach it in one move, and the cell is occupied, so it can't be eaten immediately.\n> \n> But since it's under body, it can only be eaten if vacated and head moves in, but with short life, it's not feasible. So probably, (6,2) food is not eatable; we should ignore it.\n> \n> Similarly, for other food, they are free, so can be eaten if head moves to them.\n> \n> So focus on (3,1) and (1,2).\n> \n> (3,1) has short life, only 5 turns left, must be eaten by turn 62.\n> \n> (1,2) has longer life, 10 turns.\n> \n> Also, there is the Tail Reward Danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> Currently tail is at (1,5), and food at (1,2) is not on tail, so no issue yet.\n> \n> Now, let's plan the moves.\n> \n> Current head at (3,5), direction L.\n> \n> Options: L to (2,5), U to (3,6), D to (3,4).\n> \n> I need to get to (3,1) or (1,2) soon.\n> \n> (3,1) is at (3,1), which is down-left from current position.\n> \n> From (3,5) to (3,1) is directly down, but need to go through (3,4), (3,3), etc.\n> \n> (3,4) is free, (3,3) is occupied by snake body.\n> \n> Snake has (3,3) at position 12.\n> \n> Similarly, to (1,2), from (3,5) to (1,2) is left and down.\n> \n> First, let's consider going for (3,1) since it has shorter life.\n> \n> (3,1) must be eaten by turn 62, which is 4 turns from now (turn 58,59,60,61,62; turn 58 current, so 5 turns including current?

For example:\n> \n> - At turn t: countdown N\n> \n> - Turn t+1: countdown N-1\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - Turn t + N - 1: countdown 1\n> \n> - Turn t + N: countdown 0, food disappears.\n> \n> So for food at (3,1) with life span 4 at turn 59:\n> \n> - Turn 59: available, countdown 4\n> \n> - Turn 60: countdown 3\n> \n> - Turn 61: countdown 2\n> \n> - Turn 62: countdown 1\n> \n> - Turn 63: gone\n> \n> Similarly for others.\n> \n> Food (6,2) with value 1 and life span 6 at turn 59:\n> \n> - Available until turn 64 (since 59+6-1=64? Turn 59: life span 6, so disappears after 6 turns, meaning at turn 65? I'm confusing myself.\n> \n> Standard way: if life span is N at turn t, it will be present from turn t to turn t + N - 1, inclusive. Disappears at turn t + N.\n> \n> For (3,1): turn 59, life span 4, so present turns 59,60,61,62; disappears at turn 63.\n> \n> For (6,2): turn 59, life span 6, present turns 59 to 64; disappears at turn 65.\n> \n> For (1,2): turn 59, life span 9, present turns 59 to 67; disappears at turn 68.\n> \n> But we need to think only 5+ turns ahead, so up to turn 64 or so.\n> \n> Now, snake head is at (2,5), direction left. So current possible moves: since direction is L, I can go L (continue left), or U/D (turn up or down), but not R (opposite, not allowed).\n> \n> Current head position: (2,5)\n> \n> Possible moves:\n> \n> - Left (L): to (1,5)\n> \n> - Up (U): to (2,6)\n> \n> - Down (D): to (2,4)\n> \n> But need to check for walls and collisions.\n> \n> First, walls: borders x=0,7; y=0,7. Internal obstacle at (1,6).\n> \n> So (1,5): x=1,y=5, which is within bounds, no wall at (1,5), only border at x=0, so x=1 is fine.\n> \n> (2,6): y=6, but y=7 is border, so y=6 is within 1 to 6, I think. Grid from x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? Walls at x=0 and x=7, so x from 1 to 6 inclusive. Similarly y=0 and y=7, so y from 1 to 6.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (1,6), which is x=1,y=6.\n> \n> So cells:\n> \n> - (1,5): x=1, y=5, no wall, but is it occupied? Snake body: let's list all positions.\n> \n> Snake positions: [(2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4)]\n> \n> So (1,5) is not in this list, so it's free, I think. But there might be food or something, but for movement, as long as not wall or body, it's ok, but body collision: if head moves to a body segment, it dies, except if it's the tail and tail moves away.\n> \n> Specifically: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So, for (1,5): not in snake positions, so no issue.\n> \n> Now (2,6): y=6, x=2. Walls: border y=7, so y=6 is fine. Internal obstacle at (1,6), not (2,6). Snake positions: (2,6) not listed, so free.\n> \n> (2,4): x=2,y=4, within bounds, no wall, not in snake positions, so free.\n> \n> But (2,4) is not in the list: positions are (2,5), (2,3), etc., no (2,4), so yes.\n> \n> Also, food at (3,1), (6,2), (1,2).\n> \n> (6,2) is occupied by the snake? Snake has (6,2) in the body: positions include (6,2), which is the 8th segment or something. But food at (6,2) is present? But the snake is on it, so it can be eaten only if the body moves away and head moves onto it.\n> \n> Similarly, other foods.\n> \n> Now, for turn 59, I need to choose an action: L, U, or D.\n> \n> But I need to think 5+ turns ahead, so I should simulate possible paths.\n> \n> First, let's map the grid.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, but with walls at borders and obstacle at (1,6).\n> \n> So cells: (1,1) to (6,6), except (1,6) is blocked.\n> \n> Now snake: head (2,5), going left.\n> \n> Body: from (2,5) to (1,4), 17 segments.\n> \n> Food:\n> \n> - (3,1): value +1, life until turn 62 (present turns 59,60,61,62)\n> \n> - (6,2): value +1, but snake is on it? (6,2) is part of snake body, specifically, in the list: (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), etc. So (6,2) is occupied by body, so food there can be eaten only if body moves away and head moves to it later.\n> \n> But life span: at turn 59, life span 6, so it has time.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,2): value +1, life span 9, plenty of time.\n> \n> Now, (1,2) is not occupied? Snake positions: (1,3) and (1,4), so (1,2) is free.\n> \n> (1,2) is free, since not in snake positions.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,1) is free? Snake has (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), but (3,1) not listed, so free.\n> \n> (6,2) is occupied by body segment.\n> \n> Also, for (6,2) food, since snake is on it, it can be eaten only if that body segment moves away, meaning the snake moves so that the tail leaves, and then head comes to (6,2) when it's free.\n> \n> But currently, (6,2) is not the tail; tail is (1,4).\n> \n> Tail is (1,4), so (6,2) is somewhere in the middle.\n> \n> To eat food under body, it needs to be vacated first.\n> \n> Now, I need to maximize score, so I should aim for positive food while avoiding risks.\n> \n> First, let's see possible moves from (2,5):\n> \n> - L to (1,5): (1,5) is free? As above, not occupied, so ok.\n> \n> - U to (2,6): (2,6) free, no issue.\n> \n> - D to (2,4): (2,4) free, no issue.\n> \n> But I have to consider the direction: after move, new direction will be set.\n> \n> Also, for each, what happens next.\n> \n> Moreover, I need to think about the food and the tail.\n> \n> Another thing: \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n> \n> But tail is at (1,4), and head is at (2,5), not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing a side, so (2,5) and (1,4) are diagonal, not adjacent. Adjacent cells are up, down, left, right, so (1,4) and (2,5) are not adjacent; they are diagonal. So no issue now.\n> \n> Possible adjacent cells to head: (2,5) has neighbors: (1,5) left, (3,5) right but cannot reverse, (2,6) up, (2,4) down.\n> \n> (3,5) is body, since snake body has (3,5) as second segment.\n> \n> So moving right to (3,5) would be collision, but cannot anyway since reverse not allowed.\n> \n> Now, let's evaluate each option for turn 59.\n> \n> Option 1: Move Left to (1,5)\n> \n> Then new head position: (1,5)\n> \n> Snake body: tail will move away from (1,4) to the next, but when head moves to (1,5), the body will shift, so new positions: head at (1,5), then the old head (2,5) becomes body, so segments: [(1,5), (2,5), (3,5), ... up to (1,4) but (1,4) was tail, so when snake moves, the tail is removed unless food eaten.\n> \n> Since no food eaten, tail is removed, so new snake: head at (1,5), then (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3)] and tail (1,4) is gone.\n> \n> Original positions: 17 segments. After move without eating, head moves to new position, tail is removed, so 16 segments? Let's count.\n> \n> After moving left to (1,5):\n> \n> - New head: (1,5)\n> \n> - Then the previous segments: first body segment is (2,5), then (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3)\n> \n> (1,4) was the tail, so it is removed. So new snake has 16 segments: from (1,5) to (1,3).\n> \n> (1,3) is the new tail.\n> \n> Now, at (1,5), is there food? Food at (1,2), (3,1), (6,2) but (6,2) occupied, (1,2) not here. So no food at (1,5), so no eat, length same.\n> \n> Then for next turns, I need to think.\n> \n> But let's not get ahead; first, from (1,5), possible moves: since moved left, direction is L, so can go L, U, D, but not R.\n> \n> L to (0,5): but x=0 is wall, so invalid, collision.\n> \n> U to (1,6): but (1,6) is internal obstacle, wall, so invalid.\n> \n> D to (1,4): (1,4) is now free? After move, (1,4) is not part of snake anymore, so it should be free.\n> \n> After moving to (1,5), the cell (1,4) is empty now.\n> \n> So D to (1,4) is possible.\n> \n> Also, since direction is L, I can go U or D, not R.\n> \n> U is invalid to (1,6), so only D to (1,4).\n> \n> Is that right? From (1,5), neighbors:\n> \n> - Left (0,5): wall, invalid\n> \n> - Up (1,6): obstacle, invalid\n> \n> - Down (1,4): free, valid\n> \n> - Right (2,5): but (2,5) is now the first body segment, so moving right would be collision, and also reverse not allowed since direction is L.\n> \n> So only possible move is down to (1,4).\n> \n> Then from there, and so on.\n> \n> But this seems risky because from (1,5), only one move possible, down to (1,4), then from (1,4), where to go?\n> \n> (1,4) neighbors: left (0,4) wall, up (1,5) body, right (2,4), down (1,3).\n> \n> (1,5) is body, (1,3) is tail or body? After moving to (1,4), let's see.\n> \n> If at turn 59 I move L to (1,5), then turn 60 I must move D to (1,4).\n> \n> Then at (1,4), new head position.\n> \n> Snake: after moving to (1,4), head at (1,4), body: (1,5), (2,5), etc., down to (1,3)? After turn 59 move to (1,5), snake is [(1,5), (2,5), (3,5), ..., (1,3)] with tail at (1,3).\n> \n> Then turn 60 move D to (1,4): but (1,4) is below (1,5), so moving down to (1,4).\n> \n> Then new head (1,4), and since no food, tail removed, so the last segment (1,3) is removed? Let's trace.\n> \n> After turn 59: snake at [(1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3)] 17 segments? No: after moving to (1,5) without eating, the tail (1,4) was removed, so from 17 down to 16: positions from (1,5) to (1,3), that's 16 cells? Let's list indices.\n> \n> Original: 17 segments, indices 0 to 16: head (2,5)=0, (3,5)=1, (4,5)=2, (5,5)=3, (5,4)=4, (6,4)=5, (6,3)=6, (6,2)=7, (6,1)=8, (5,1)=9, (4,1)=10, (4,2)=11, (4,3)=12, (3,3)=13, (2,3)=14, (1,3)=15, (1,4)=16 tail.\n> \n> After move left to (1,5): new head (1,5), then the previous head (2,5) becomes segment 1, and so on, up to (1,3) which was segment 15, now segment 15, and tail (1,4) removed, so new segments: (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3) — that's 17 segments? (1,3) is included, and (1,4) removed, but (1,3) was already there, so the list has 17 positions but one is duplicated or something? No.\n> \n> When head moves to new cell, the tail is removed, so the snake shortens by one cell if no food eaten.\n> \n> Original snake: 17 cells. After moving to new head position without eating, the new snake has head at new position, and the body from the old head to the second-to-last segment, so 16 cells.\n> \n> For example: old positions: H, B1, B2, ..., B15, T\n> \n> After move to new H' without eat: new positions H', H, B1, B2, ..., B15, and T is removed. So B15 becomes the new tail.\n> \n> In this case: old: H=(2,5), B1=(3,5), ..., B15=(1,3), T=(1,4)\n> \n> After move to (1,5): new H' = (1,5), then H=(2,5), B1=(3,5), ..., up to B15=(1,3), and T=(1,4) removed.

No, in Snake, when you move without eating, the tail moves forward, so the length stays the same, but the tail cell is vacated.\n> \n> In terms of positions, the number of segments remains the same; the snake moves forward by one cell, so the head is new, the tail is removed, so the body shifts.\n> \n> In this case, from 17 segments, after move without eat, still 17 segments, but the tail has changed.\n> \n> In the new list, (1,3) is the last, which was previously the second-to-last.\n> \n> But in the list, it's 17 positions.\n> \n> For turn 60, from (1,5), move down to (1,4).\n> \n> Then new head at (1,4), and body: (1,5), (2,5), etc., and tail (1,3) removed? When head moves to (1,4), old head (1,5) becomes body, so new positions: (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3) and tail (1,3) removed, so new tail is (2,3)?

So new snake: (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3) — 17 segments, tail at (2,3).\n> \n> Then from (1,4), possible moves: direction is down (since moved down from (1,5) to (1,4)), so can go D, L, R, not U.\n> \n> D to (1,3): but (1,3) is not occupied now, but in the new snake, (1,3) is removed, so free.\n> \n> L to (0,4) wall, invalid.\n> \n> R to (2,4): (2,4) free?

Previous direction at (1,3) was D (since moved down from (1,4)).\n> \n> After moving to (1,3), head direction is D.\n> \n> Then move right to (2,3), new direction R.\n> \n> New positions: head (2,3), body: (1,3) [prev head], (1,4) [prev seg1], (2,4) [prev seg2], (2,5) [prev seg3], (3,5) [prev seg4], ..., up to (4,3) [prev seg14], and tail (3,3) gone? List: head (2,3), then (1,3), (1,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3) — tail at (4,3)? Positions: after move to (2,3), head (2,3), body: previous head (1,3), then previous positions: seg1 was (1,4), seg2 was (2,4), seg3 was (2,5), seg4 was (3,5), seg5 was (4,5), seg6 was (5,5), seg7 was (5,4), seg8 was (6,4), seg9 was (6,3), seg10 was (6,2), seg11 was (6,1), seg12 was (5,1), seg13 was (4,1), seg14 was (4,2), seg15 was (4,3), and prev tail (3,3) gone, so new tail at (4,3).\n> \n> From (2,3), I can move down to (2,2), but (2,2) may be free, or to (3,3), but (3,3) is gone, so (3,3) is free now?

Turn 61 from (1,4) move to (1,3), then turn 62 from (1,3) can move to (2,3), but (2,3) is not (3,1).\n> \n> From (1,3) to (1,2) or to (2,3), neither is (3,1).\n> \n> To reach (3,1) by turn 62, I need to be at (3,2) or (2,1) or (4,1) or (3,0) but y=0 wall, so only (3,2), (2,1), (4,1).\n> \n> (2,1) and (4,1) are occupied by snake.\n> \n> At turn 60, (4,1) and (5,1), (6,1) are body segments.\n> \n> (2,1) not occupied.\n> \n> (3,2) not occupied.\n> \n> So from (2,4), I can go to (3,4) at turn 60, then at turn 61 from (3,4) I can go to (3,3) but occupied, or to (4,4), then at turn 62 from (4,4) I can go to (4,3) occupied, or to (3,4) occupied, or to (5,4) occupied, or to (4,5) occupied, all bad.\n> \n> From (3,4), after move, I can go to (4,4) if free, but from (4,4), I can only go to (4,3) if it frees up, but it won't soon.\n> \n> Another path: from (2,4) move left to (1,4) at turn 60, then at turn 61 move down to (1,3), then at turn 62 move down to (1,2), but (1,2) is food, not (3,1).\n> \n> From (1,3) at turn 61, I can move right to (2,3), then at turn 62 from (2,3) I can move down to (2,2) if free, then at turn 63 to (2,1) or (3,2), but (3,1) gone.\n> \n> But turn 62 is last chance for (3,1), so I need to be at (3,1) on turn 62.\n> \n> To be at (3,1) on turn 62, on turn 61 I need to be at a cell adjacent to (3,1), so (3,2), (2,1), (4,1), or (3,0) invalid.\n> \n> (2,1) and (3,2) are potential.\n> \n> At turn 61, where can I be?\n> \n> If at turn 60 I move to (3,4), then at turn 61 from (3,4) I can only go to (4,4) if available, then at turn 62 from (4,4) to (4,3) or something, not to (3,1).\n> \n> If at turn 60 I move to (1,4), then at turn 61 from (1,4) I can go to (1,3) or (1,5).\n> \n> If I go to (1,3), then at turn 62 I can go to (1,2) or (2,3).\n> \n> From

If I move right to (3,4), then from (3,4) on turn 61, I can move to (3,3) but occupied, or (4,4), not to (3,2).\n> \n> If I move left to (1,4), then from (1,4) on turn 61, I can move to (1,3) or (1,5), neither is (3,2).\n> \n> So it's impossible to reach (3,2) or (2,1) by turn 61 from current position.\n> \n> Therefore, I cannot eat (3,1) at all, because I can't reach it by turn 62.\n> \n> Is that true?\n> \n> Let's list all possible paths in 2 moves from (2,4).\n> \n> Turn 60: move to (1,4) or (3,4).\n> \n> If to (1,4), then turn 61: from (1,4) move to (1,3) or (1,5).\n> \n> If to (1,5), then at (1,5).\n> \n> None of these are adjacent to (3,1).\n> \n> If to (3,4), turn 61: to (4,4) or if possible (3,3) but not, or (2,4) occupied, so only (4,4).\n> \n> Then at (4,4), not adjacent to (3,1).\n> \n> Adjacent cells to (3,1) are (3,2), (2,1), (4,1), (3,0) invalid.\n> \n> (4,1) is occupied by snake at all times, since it's a body segment.\n> \n> (2,1) is free, but not reached.\n> \n> (3,2) is free, not reached.\n> \n> So indeed, from current position, in two moves, I cannot be adjacent to (3,1), so I cannot eat it on turn 62 either.\n> \n> On turn 60, if I could move to a cell that is closer, but I can't.\n> \n> Perhaps the food can be eaten if the head moves onto it when free, but since I can't reach it in time, I must abandon (3,1).\n> \n> It has only 3 life span, but I can't eat it, so I should focus on other food.\n> \n> Now, (6,2) food is at (6,2), currently occupied, life span 5, so must eat by turn 64.\n> \n> And (1,2) by turn 67.\n> \n> Also, after moving, the food at (6,2) might become free.\n> \n> Let's plan to eat (6,2) or (1,2).\n> \n> First, let's choose an action for turn 60.\n> \n> Options: move left to (1,4) or right to (3,4).\n> \n> If I move right to (3,4), then I can go to (4,4), then I need to find a way to free up space.\n> \n> The snake is long, and the tail is moving, so cells will free up over time.\n> \n> For example, tail is at (1,3), and as snake moves without eating, tail moves, so (1,3) frees up, then (1,2) might be accessible.\n> \n> But (1,2) is food, so I can eat it when I move to it.\n> \n> Similarly, for (6,2), it's occupied, but as the snake moves, the segment at (6,2) will move away.\n> \n> In the current positions, (6,2) is segment 8.\n> \n> When the snake moves, segment 8 moves to where segment 7 was, which is (6,3), but let's see the movement.\n> \n> At turn 60, if I move head to (3,4), then new positions as before: head (3,4), body (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3) tail.\n> \n> (6,2) is still occupied by index 9.\n> \n> At turn 61, if I move head to (4,4), for example.\n> \n> From (3,4), I can move to (4,4), assuming (4,4) free.\n> \n> New head (4,4), direction R.\n> \n> New positions: head (4,4), body: (3,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3) — tail (2,3) gone, new tail (3,3).\n> \n> (6,2) is now index 10, still occupied.\n> \n> The segment at (6,2) will move to (6,3) next if head moves, but it's slow.\n> \n> To free (6,2), I need the snake to move so that the segment that was on (6,2) moves away, and no other segment is there, then head can move in.\n> \n> But since the snake is long, it takes time for the body to move away.\n> \n> For example, the segment at (6,2) is part of the body, and it will follow the head's path with delay.\n> \n> To eat (6,2), I need to have the head move to (6,2) when it's free.\n> \n> Currently, it's occupied, and the countdown to free it depends on how the snake moves.\n> \n> Similarly, moving left might be better for (1,2).\n> \n> Let's consider moving left to (1,4) at turn 60.\n> \n> Then at turn 61, from (1,4), I can move down to (1,3).\n> \n> Then at (1,3), I can move down to (1,2) to eat the food at (1,2) on turn 62.\n> \n> (1,2) has value 1, life span 8, so I can eat it.\n> \n> Then the snake grows, so length increases.\n> \n> After eating, the tail doesn't move, so the position where tail was remains.\n> \n> At turn 60: move to (1,4)\n> \n> Positions: head (1,4), body (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3) tail\n> \n> Turn 61: move down to (1,3)\n> \n> New head (1,3), body: (1,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3) — tail (2,3) gone\n> \n> Now, food at (1,2) is adjacent, so at turn 62, move down to (1,2) to eat it.\n> \n> Then, because eating food, the snake grows, so the tail is not removed. New positions: head at (1,2), then body: (1,3), (1,4), (2,4), (2,5), etc., and the tail remains, so the segment that was at (3,3) is now tail, but since we ate, we add a new segment at the tail position, so length increases.\n> \n> When you eat food, the length increases by one, so the tail doesn't move; the new position is added at the tail.\n> \n> After move to (1,2) with eat, new head (1,2), body: previous head position (1,3), then the rest of body, and since ate, no tail removal, so new tail is the old tail position, which was (3,3), but with growth, the tail stays and a new segment is added? Standard snake growth: when you eat, you move the head to food, body follows, but tail doesn't move, so length increases.\n> \n> Positions: after moving to (1,2) with eat, head at (1,2), then the first body segment is previous head (1,3), then previous body segments: (1,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3) — and since ate, the tail (3,3) is not removed, so it remains, and the new segment is added at the end, so the body includes (3,3) as part of it, and the new tail is still (3,3)? No.\n> \n> Let's clarify: when no eat, head moves to new cell, each segment moves to previous position, tail is removed.\n> \n> With eat, head moves to new cell (food), each segment moves to previous position, but tail is not removed, so the new positions have one more segment; the tail from before remains in place.\n> \n> So after eating, the snake is longer.\n> \n> At turn 61, positions before move: head (1,3), body (1,4), (2,4), ..., (3,3) tail.\n> \n> Move head to (1,2) and eat food.\n> \n> New head (1,2), then body: (1,3) [previous head], (1,4) [previous seg1], (2,4) [previous seg2], ..., up to (3,3) [previous tail, now part of body], and since ate, no removal, so new positions include all previous plus the new head, so length 17 again? Before turn 61, after move to (1,3), length was 16 (since tail removed). At turn 60 after move to (1,4), length 16. Turn 61 after move to (1,3), no eat, length 15? Let's count positions.\n> \n> At turn 60 start: 17 positions.\n> \n> After move to (1,4) at turn 60: new positions, head (1,4), then 16 body segments from previous, but tail removed, so 16 positions.\n> \n> Similarly, at turn 61, after move to (1,3): head (1,3), then body: (1,4), (2,4), ..., up to (3,3), and tail (2,3) was gone, so how many? From previous: at turn 60 after move, positions: (1,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3) — that's 17 positions? No:\n> \n> At turn 60 after move to (1,4): head (1,4), then the body consists of the previous positions except the tail is removed.\n> \n> Previous positions at turn 60 start: 17 cells.\n> \n> Move head to (1,4), so new head (1,4).\n> \n> Then the first body segment is previous head (2,4).\n> \n> Second body segment is previous seg1 (2,5).\n> \n> Third is previous seg2 (3,5).\n> \n> ...\n> \n> Up to the 16th body segment is previous seg15 (2,3)?

after eat, head (1,2), then body: (1,3), (1,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3) tail.\n> \n> So (6,2) is index 11 (0-based head, 1: (1,3), 2: (1,4), 3: (2,4), 4: (2,5), 5: (3,5), 6: (4,5), 7: (5,5), 8: (5,4), 9: (6,4), 10: (6,3), 11: (6,2), 12: (6,1), etc.\n> \n> So it will take at least 11 moves for that segment to move away, but as the snake moves, the body moves, so after k moves, the segment that was at (6,2) will be at the position of the segment k steps ahead.\n> \n> After one move, if head moves, the segment at (6,2) moves to where the segment before it was, which is (6,3), but (6,3) is occupied by index 10, so it moves to (6,3) if index 10 moves, but when head moves, all segments shift.\n> \n> When head moves to a new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment before it.\n> \n> So for index 11 (6,2), it will move to the previous position of index 10, which was (6,3).\n> \n> Similarly, after move, (6,2) is no longer occupied, but (6,3) is occupied by the new segment.\n> \n> But the food at (6,2) might be free if no one is on it after the move.\n> \n> After a move, if the cell is not occupied, the food can be eaten.\n> \n> But in this case, after a move, the cell (6,2) may be free or not.\n> \n> For example, at turn 62, (6,2) occupied.\n> \n> After head moves to (2,2), new positions: head (2,2), body: (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3) — tail (3,3) gone, new tail at (4,3).\n> \n> (6,2) is now occupied by index 12, since head (2,2), body 1: (1,2), 2: (1,3), 3: (1,4), 4: (2,4), 5: (2,5), 6: (3,5), 7: (4,5), 8: (5,5), 9: (5,4), 10: (6,4), 11: (6,3), 12: (6,2), etc.\n> \n> So (6,2) still occupied.\n> \n> Similarly, each move, the segment on (6,2) changes, but it remains occupied until the body moves past.\n> \n> The cell (6,2) will be free when the segment that was on it moves away and no other segment moves to it.\n> \n> Since the snake is moving, (6,2) might be free when the tail passes or something.\n> \n> But the tail is at (3,3), far away.\n> \n> It might take many turns to free (6,2).\n> \n> For example, if I move the head towards the right, the body will follow, and eventually the segment at (6,2) will move.\n> \n> But it could take 10 turns or more.\n> \n> With life span 5 at turn 60, by turn 64, it might be possible.\n> \n> But let's estimate.\n> \n> From head at (1,2) to (6,2), I can move right and down.\n> \n> But with the body, I need to avoid collisions.\n> \n> Perhaps it's better to move towards the area to free up space.\n> \n> Since (3,1) is not eatable, I should accept that and focus on long-term survival and other food.\n> \n> There is also the food at (1,2) which I can eat soon.\n> \n> So for turn 60, I will move left to (1,4) to set up for eating (1,2).\n> \n> Then sequence:\n> \n> Turn 60: move L to (1,4)\n> \n> Turn 61: move D to (1,3)\n> \n> Turn 62: move D to (1,2) to eat food.\n> \n> Then at turn 63, from (1,2), I can move R to (2,2) or D to (1,1).\n> \n> I need to think about the direction.\n> \n> After eating, head at (1,2), direction D (since moved down).\n> \n> Then possible moves: U to (1,3) occupied, D to (1,1) if free, L invalid, R to (2,2) if free.\n> \n> (1,1) should be free, (2,2) free.\n> \n> I can move to (2,2) to start moving right.\n> \n> Or to (1,1) to go down.\n> \n> But to reach (6,2), moving right is better.\n> \n> Also, (6,2) food needs to be free.\n> \n> At turn 62 after eating, (6,2) occupied.\n> \n> After each move, the occupation changes.\n> \n> For example, at turn 63, if I move from (1,2) to (2,2), new head (2,2), body (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,4), etc., and tail moves, so (6,2) still occupied by some segment.\n> \n> The index of (6,2) decreases as the head moves away, but the position may change slowly.\n> \n> Perhaps I can move in a way that the body straightens or something.\n> \n> But it's complicated.\n> \n> Since the food at (6,2) has value 1 and is risky to get, and (1,2) is easy, I can eat (1,2) and then ignore (6,2) if it's too risky, and just survive for points, but there might be more food later, but not specified, so only these food for now.\n> \n> The state has only these food, but new food may spawn, but not mentioned, so I think only these are present.\n> \n> To maximize score, I should try to eat all possible food.\n> \n> But (3,1) impossible, so only (1,2) and (6,2).\n> \n> (1,2) I can eat at turn 62.\n> \n> (6,2) I can try to eat by turn 64.\n> \n> But from (1,2) to (6,2), with a long snake, it might take 5 or 6 moves to get close, but (6,2) may not be free.\n> \n> For example, from (1,2) to (2,2) turn 63, to (3,2) turn 64, but (3,2) may be free, then to (4,2) turn 65, etc., but (6,2) life span ends after turn 64, so must eat by turn 64.\n> \n> At turn 63, from (1,2) I can be at (2,2), not adjacent to (6,2).\n> \n> At turn 64, from (2,2) I can be at (3,2) or (2,1), not (6,2).\n> \n> So I cannot reach (6,2) by turn 64 from there.\n> \n> Therefore, it might be impossible to eat (6,2) as well, because the snake is in the way and I can't reach it in time.\n> \n> Similarly, from the beginning, if I had moved differently.\n> \n> But at turn 60, if I move right to (3,4), then to (4,4), then to (5,4) but (5,4) occupied, or to (4,3) occupied, no good.\n> \n> So I think I cannot eat any food except (1,2), and (3,1) and (6,2) are not accessible in time.\n> \n> So the best is to eat (1,2) and then survive.\n> \n> For the action sequence, I'll go for (1,2).\n> \n> Turn 60: move L to (1,4)\n> \n> Turn 61: move D to (1,3)\n> \n> Turn 62: move D to (1,2) eat food\n> \n> Then for the next turns, I need to plan to avoid walls and body.\n> \n> After turn 62, head at (1,2), direction D.\n> \n> Then turn 63: can move R to (2,2) or D to (1,1).\n> \n> Let's move R to (2,2) to go towards the center.\n> \n> Turn 64: from (2,2), can move U, D, L, R.\n> \n> L to (1,2) occupied, U to (2,3) may be free, D to (2,1) free, R to (3,2) free.\n> \n> Say move R to (3,2).\n> \n> Turn 65: from (3,2), move to (4,2) or (3,3),

It's turn 61, and the grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. There's also an internal obstacle at (1,6).\n> \n> The snake positions are given as a list: head is at (1,4), then (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3). So the snake is 17 segments long.\n> \n> The head direction is L, which means left, so the snake is currently moving left.\n> \n> Now, food items:\n> \n> - (3,1) with life span 2, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (6,2) with life span 4, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (1,2) with life span 7, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> - (4,3) with life span 10, value 1 (positive)\n> \n> All food is positive, no negative food here.\n> \n> Life span indicates how many turns left before it disappears, including the current turn. So for (3,1), life span 2 means it will disappear after turn 62 if not eaten? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so:\n> \n> - At turn 61, life span 2: will disappear after turn 62? Let's clarify.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So if life span is S at turn T, it will disappear after S turns, meaning it can be eaten until turn T + S - 1, I think? Let's think carefully.\n> \n> Suppose at turn T, a food has life span S. After turn T, life span becomes S-1. It disappears when life span reaches 0, so it exists from turn T to turn T + S - 1, and disappears at the start of turn T + S? I need to be precise.\n> \n> The rule says: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so at the beginning of turn T, if life span is S, after the turn, it decreases to S-1. It is present during turn T and can be eaten if the head moves to it during turn T.\n> \n> After turn T, life span becomes S-1, so if S-1 > 0, it remains for next turn.\n> \n> It disappears when after decreasing, life span becomes 0.\n> \n> So for (3,1) at turn 61, life span 2: it is present on turn 61 and 62, disappears after turn 62.\n> \n> Similarly, (6,2) life span 4: present turns 61,62,63,64, disappears after turn 64.\n> \n> (1,2) life span 7: present turns 61 to 67.\n> \n> (4,3) life span 10: present turns 61 to 70.\n> \n> All values are +1, so all good to eat.\n> \n> Now, the snake head is at (1,4), moving left. So from (1,4), moving left would go to (0,4), but x=0 is a wall, so moving left is impossible—it would cause a wall collision.\n> \n> Head direction is L, and it's at (1,4). If it moves left to (0,4), x=0 is border wall, so that's invalid and deadly.\n> \n> Therefore, the snake cannot move left; it must choose another direction, but it has to move in a direction that doesn't cause instant death.\n> \n> The action choices are U, D, L, R, but L is towards wall, so not possible. Also, no instant reverse: since current direction is L, it cannot move R (right) immediately, because that would be opposite direction.\n> \n> Current head direction is L, so moving R would be reverse, which is not allowed.\n> \n> Therefore, possible moves are U (up) or D (down), since L is wall and R is reverse.\n> \n> From (1,4), possible adjacent cells:\n> \n> - Up: (1,5)\n> \n> - Down: (1,3)\n> \n> - Left: (0,4) wall, invalid\n> \n> - Right: (2,4) but (2,4) is the second segment of the snake, which is the body.\n> \n> Snake positions: head (1,4), then (2,4), which is directly right.\n> \n> If it moves right to (2,4), that is the position of the second segment. But at the start of the turn, before movement, (2,4) is occupied by the body. After movement, the head moves to (2,4), and the tail moves, so it might be okay, but let's see the collision rules.\n> \n> Collision: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment).

It's turn 63, and the grid is 8x8 since borders are x=0/x=7 and y=0/y=7, meaning coordinates from (0,0) to (7,7). There's an internal obstacle at (1,6).\n> \n> Snake positions: head at (2,3), then (1,3), (1,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3). So the snake has 17 segments. Head direction is right (R), so it's moving east.\n> \n> Food items:\n> \n> - (6,2) with value 1 and life span 3\n> \n> - (1,2) with value 1 and life span 5\n> \n> - (4,3) with value 1 and life span 8\n> \n> All food has value +1, so they're all positive food. Life span means how many turns they last, decreasing each turn, including the current one.\n> \n> Now, I need to choose a sequence of actions for the next few turns, thinking at least 5 turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks. Prioritize long-term survival over immediate rewards.\n> \n> First, let's map out the grid. I'll sketch a grid to visualize.\n> \n> Grid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n> \n> Walls: borders are walls, so cells where x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Also, internal obstacle at (1,6).\n> \n> Snake positions:\n> \n> Head: (2,3)\n> \n> Body: (1,3), (1,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3)\n> \n> (4,3) is the tail? Let's list in order:\n> \n> Index 0: (2,3) head\n> \n> 1: (1,3)\n> \n> 2: (1,4)\n> \n> 3: (2,4)\n> \n> 4: (2,5)\n> \n> 5: (3,5)\n> \n> 6: (4,5)\n> \n> 7: (5,5)\n> \n> 8: (5,4)\n> \n> 9: (6,4)\n> \n> 10: (6,3)\n> \n> 11: (6,2)\n> \n> 12: (6,1)\n> \n> 13: (5,1)\n> \n> 14: (4,1)\n> \n> 15: (4,2)\n> \n> 16: (4,3) tail\n> \n> So tail is at (4,3).\n> \n> Now food:\n> \n> - (6,2): but (6,2) is currently occupied by the snake's body at index 11. Food can be under the body but can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves there.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,3) is the tail, and there's food at (4,3)? Food positions: (6,2,3,1), (1,2,5,1), (4,3,8,1)\n> \n> (4,3) has food with value 1, life span 8. But (4,3) is the tail position. So food is under the tail.\n> \n> Now, head is at (2,3), direction right.\n> \n> Possible moves: since head is moving right, it can go U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), R (right, x+1). Cannot go left (L) because that's opposite direction, and no instant reverse is allowed. Current direction is R, so cannot go L.\n> \n> So from (2,3), possible moves:\n> \n> - U: to (2,4)\n> \n> - D: to (2,2)\n> \n> - R: to (3,3)\n> \n> Now, check what's at these cells.\n> \n> First, (2,4): looking at snake positions, (2,4) is index 3. So it's occupied by body. Cannot move there, collision.\n> \n> (2,2): is this a wall or free? Walls are borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. (2,2) is not border, and no internal obstacle mentioned except (1,6). So should be free, but is it occupied by snake?\n> \n> Snake positions: (2,3) head, (1,3), (1,4), (2,4), (2,5), etc. No (2,2), so should be empty.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,3): not in snake positions, not wall, so free.\n> \n> Food at (1,2), (6,2), (4,3), but (4,3) is tail, (6,2) is body.\n> \n> Now, life spans: current turn 63.\n> \n> Food at (6,2) life span 3, so disappears after 3 turns, meaning it will be gone if not eaten by turn 65? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 63, life span 3, then turn 64, life span 2, turn 65, life span 1, turn 66, life span 0, gone. So must be eaten by turn 65 to get it, I think. When life span reaches 0, it disappears before the turn or after?\n> \n> The rule says: \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n> \n> So for food with life span L at turn t, it will disappear at turn t + L - 1? Let's clarify.\n> \n> Suppose at turn t, life span is L. After turn t, it decreases to L-1. When L-1=0, it disappears, so it is present until the end of turn t + L - 1.\n> \n> Standard way: if life span is N at turn t, it exists for N more turns, so it can be eaten on turns t, t+1, ..., t+N-1, and disappears after turn t+N-1, before turn t+N.\n> \n> For (6,2): life span 3 at turn 63, so can be eaten on turn 63, 64, or 65. Disappears after turn 65.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,2): life span 5, can be eaten turn 63 to 67.\n> \n> (4,3): life span 8, turn 63 to 70.\n> \n> But (4,3) is currently occupied by tail. To eat it, the tail must move away, and head moves there later.\n> \n> Similarly for (6,2), occupied by body at index 11.\n> \n> Now, back to possible moves for head at (2,3):\n> \n> - U to (2,4): but (2,4) is occupied by body, so collision, death. Cannot.\n> \n> - D to (2,2): free, no wall, no snake? Snake positions: (2,3) head, then (1,3), (1,4), (2,4), etc. No (2,2), so empty. Also, not a food position? Food at (1,2), (6,2), (4,3). (2,2) no food.\n> \n> - R to (3,3): free, no snake, not food.\n> \n> (3,3) is empty.\n> \n> Now, if I move D to (2,2), what happens? Head moves to (2,2), body follows: tail (4,3) will move to (4,2)? When head moves, the body shifts: the head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so tail moves away from its current position.\n> \n> Specifically: after moving, new head position, then body segments: segment 1 moves to old head position (2,3), segment 2 to old segment 1 position (1,3), and so on, last segment (tail) moves to previous tail position? No.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, the tail leaves its cell, and each body segment advances.\n> \n> So after move, the cell that was tail is now empty, unless food is there or something.\n> \n> In this case, if head moves from (2,3) to (2,2), then:\n> \n> New head: (2,2)\n> \n> Body: segment 1 (was index 1: (1,3)) moves to old head position? No.\n> \n> The positions update: the new head is at the new position, then the first body segment moves to the old head position, second to old first body position, etc.\n> \n> So indices:\n> \n> After move down to (2,2):\n> \n> - New head: (2,2)\n> \n> - Then body: segment 0 (old head) was (2,3), so segment 1 moves to (2,3)\n> \n> Segment 1 was (1,3), now moves to (2,3)\n> \n> Then segment 2 was (1,4), moves to (1,3)  // position of segment 1\n> \n> Segment 3 was (2,4), moves to (1,4)  // position of segment 2\n> \n> Segment 4 was (2,5), moves to (2,4)  // position of segment 3\n> \n> And so on, up to segment 16 was (4,3), moves to position of segment 15, which was (4,2)?

        "thinking": "### Understanding the Current State\n\nFirst, let's summarize the current state of the game:\n\n- **Grid Size**: 8x8 (coordinates from (0,0) to (7,7))\n- **Walls**: Borders (x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7) and an internal obstacle at (1,6)\n- **Snake**:\n  - Head at (2,2), direction D (down, meaning the snake is facing downwards)\n  - Body segments: [(2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2)]\n  - Length: 17 segments\n- **Food**:\n  - (6,2): value +1, life_span 2\n  - (1,2): value +1, life_span 4\n  - (4,3): value +1, life_span 7\n  - (5,3): value +1, life_span 10\n\n### Possible Moves from Current Position (2,2)\n\nThe snake's head is at (2,2) facing down (D). The possible moves are:\n\n1. **Up (U)**: (2,1)\n   - But this is the reverse of the current direction (D), which is not allowed.\n2. **Down (D)**: (2,3)\n   - However, (2,3) is the first body segment, leading to a collision.\n3. **Left (L)**: (1,2)\n   - Check if (1,2) is safe:\n     - Not a wall (not x=0 or y=0 or internal obstacle)\n     - Not occupied by the snake's body (from the positions list)\n   - Contains food with value +1.\n4. **Right (R)**: (3,2)\n   - Check if (3,2) is safe:\n     - Not a wall\n     - Not occupied by the snake's body\n   - No food present.\n\nSo, the viable immediate moves are **Left (L)** to (1,2) or **Right (R)** to (3,2).\n\n### Evaluating Move Left (L) to (1,2)\n\n**Pros**:\n- Immediate consumption of food at (1,2), increasing score by +1 and length by 1.\n  \n**Cons**:\n- After moving to (1,2), the next possible moves are limited:\n  - From (1,2), direction is now L (left).\n  - Possible moves: U, D, R (cannot move L, reverse of L is R, which is not allowed immediately).\n    - U to (1,1):\n      - Safe, no collision or walls.\n    - D to (1,3):\n      - (1,3) is a body segment, collision.\n    - R to (2,2):\n      - (2,2) is now part of the body (after moving head to (1,2)), collision.\n    - L to (0,2):\n      - x=0 is a wall.\n  - Only safe move is U to (1,1).\n    - From (1,1), next moves are very limited, likely leading to a dead end soon due to the snake's length.\n\n**Conclusion**: Moving left leads to a risky path with high chance of getting trapped due to the snake's length and limited space in the top-left corner.\n\n### Evaluating Move Right (R) to (3,2)\n\n**Pros**:\n- Moves towards the center and more open space.\n- Opens a path to reach other foods at (4,3) and (5,3) which have longer life spans.\n  \n**Cons**:\n- No immediate food consumption.\n\n**Plan After Moving Right**:\n1. **Turn 64**: Move R to (3,2).\n   - New head position: (3,2), direction R.\n2. **Turn 65**: From (3,2), possible moves:\n   - U to (3,1)\n   - D to (3,3)\n   - R to (4,2)\n   - Cannot move L (reverse of R).\n   - Best move: R to (4,2) to approach (4,3).\n3. **Turn 66**: From (4,2), move D to (4,3) to eat food.\n   - New head: (4,3), direction D.\n4. **Turn 67**: From (4,3), move R to (5,3) to eat another food.\n   - New head: (5,3), direction R.\n\nThis sequence allows eating two foods ((4,3) and (5,3)) while keeping the snake in a more open area, reducing collision risks.\n\n### Why Not Try to Eat (6,2)?\n\n- (6,2) is currently under the snake's body (segment at (6,2)).\n- To eat it:\n  - The body must move away from (6,2).\n  - Then, the head must move to (6,2) before it disappears (life_span=2 at turn 64, so disappears after turn 65).\n- From (2,2), even if we move towards (6,2), we cannot reach it in one move after the body moves away, making it impossible to eat before it disappears.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nGiven the analysis, moving **Right (R)** at turn 64 is the better choice as it:\n\n1. Avoids the risky top-left corner.\n2. Provides a path to consume two foods ((4,3) and (5,3)) with higher life spans.\n3. Keeps the snake in a more open area, reducing the chance of immediate collisions.\n\n### Action Sequence\n\nBased on the above reasoning, the immediate action at turn 64 is to move **Right (R)**. The subsequent planned moves are:\n\n- Turn 64: R\n- Turn 65: R\n- Turn 66: D\n- Turn 67: R\n\nHowever, since the task is to decide the **immediate action for the current Turn \\( t_0 = 64 \\)**, the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{R}",

It's turn 64, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since the borders are x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7. There's also an internal obstacle at (1,6).\n> \n> The snake positions are: head at (2,2), then (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2). So the snake has 17 segments. The head direction is down, which is D, meaning moving towards decreasing y, so from (2,2) it was moving to (2,1) or something? Let's see the positions: from head (2,2) to (2,3) – that seems inconsistent with direction.\n> \n> Head is at (2,2), and the next segment is (2,3). If direction is D (down, decreasing y), but (2,3) has y=3 which is higher than y=2, so that would be up? I think I have a confusion.\n> \n> Direction D means down, so y decreases. But the snake positions: head (2,2), then (2,3). (2,3) has y=3, which is north of (2,2) if y increases up. Typically in grids, y=0 is bottom or top? The borders are y=0 and y=7, so I need to know the coordinate system.\n> \n> Looking at the walls: border cells x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7. So it's a grid from x=0 to 7, y=0 to 7. Now, is y=0 the bottom or top? It doesn't specify, but in many games, y=0 is top or bottom. I need to infer from the positions.\n> \n> Snake head at (2,2), direction D (down). If down means decreasing y, then moving to (2,1) would be down. But the next segment is (2,3), which has higher y, so that suggests that y increases as we go up? Let's see the sequence.\n> \n> Positions: (2,2) head, then (2,3), so from (2,2) to (2,3) is +y, which is up if y=0 is bottom? I think I need to assume a coordinate system.\n> \n> Typically in such problems, (0,0) is top-left, y increases down, or bottom-left, y increases up. But here, since direction is given as D for down, and positions, let's see.\n> \n> Head direction is D, meaning it was moving down to reach (2,2). But the previous position isn't given, only the current positions. The positions list is from head to tail.\n> \n> The positions are listed as [(x0,y0), (x1,y1), ...] with head first. So (2,2) is head, then (2,3) is the first body segment. That means the snake was moving from (2,3) to (2,2)? No.\n> \n> If head is at (2,2) and direction is D, meaning it entered (2,2) from above, so from (2,3)? But (2,3) is the next segment, which is part of the body. I'm confusing myself.\n> \n> Let's think: the direction \"Snake Head Direction\" is the direction it is currently facing, meaning the direction it moved to get to the current head position.\n> \n> So, head is at (2,2), and it moved there in the direction D (down). Down means decreasing y if y=0 is top, or increasing y if y=0 is bottom. But from the positions, since the next segment is (2,3), that means the head was previously at (2,3) or something? No.\n> \n> The positions are the current positions. Head at (2,2), then the segment behind it is (2,3). So, the snake was at (2,3) in the previous turn, and it moved down to (2,2)? But if it moved down from (2,3) to (2,2), that would mean y decreased, so y=3 to y=2, so if y=0 is top, y=3 is below y=2? I need to define the coordinate system.\n> \n> Assume that (0,0) is the top-left corner, so y increases downward, x increases right. That is standard in many grids.\n> \n> So, if (0,0) is top-left, then:\n> \n> - U (up) decreases y\n> \n> - D (down) increases y\n> \n> - L (left) decreases x\n> \n> - R (right) increases x\n> \n> Now, head at (2,2), direction D (down). Since it moved down to get to (2,2), that means it came from above, so from (2,1)? But the positions show next segment at (2,3), which is below (2,2) if y increases down.\n> \n> If y increases down, then (2,2) to (2,3) is down, +y.\n> \n> But direction is given as D, meaning it moved down to (2,2). So if it moved down to (2,2), it came from (2,1) if y increases down? Let's clarify.\n> \n> Suppose (0,0) top-left, y increases down.\n> \n> Then:\n> \n> - Moving U (up) to (x,y) means from (x,y+1)\n> \n> - Moving D (down) to (x,y) means from (x,y-1)\n> \n> - Moving L (left) to (x,y) means from (x+1,y)\n> \n> - Moving R (right) to (x,y) means from (x-1,y)\n> \n> For current head position (2,2), direction D means it moved down to (2,2), so it came from (2,1), because moving down to (2,2) from (2,1) — if y increases down, (2,1) is above (2,2).\n> \n> But the positions list has head at (2,2), then next is (2,3). (2,3) is below (2,2) if y increases down.\n> \n> So if head is at (2,2) and it came from (2,1) (above), then the body should be behind it, which would be (2,3)? But (2,3) is below, so that doesn't match.\n> \n> Perhaps the direction is the current facing direction, for the next move.\n> \n> Let's read the input: \"Snake Head Direction: D\" and it says \"action on turn\" for moves.\n> \n> In the movement constraints, it says \"in each turn you can choose to move 1 cell in direction U, D, L, R\".\n> \n> And \"Snake Head Direction\" is given, which is the direction it is currently facing, so for the next move, I can choose any direction except the opposite, due to no instant reverse.\n> \n> Also, for the positions, the list is [head, segment1, segment2, ..., tail].\n> \n> So for head at (2,2), with direction D, that means it is facing down, so if y increases down, it is facing towards increasing y.\n> \n> Then the next segment is (2,3), which is consistent with it moving down to (2,3) in the next or something.\n> \n> I think I should just accept the positions as given.\n> \n> Positions: (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2)\n> \n> So head at (2,2), tail at (4,2).\n> \n> Direction D, so it is facing down.\n> \n> Now, food positions:\n> \n> - (6,2,2,1)  // this is (x,y, life_span, value) I think. Format is (x,y, life_span, value) but it says \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span\" and in the list it's ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 ) so for (6,2,2,1) it might be (x,y, life_span, value) or (x,y, value, life_span)? Let's see the input.\n> \n> It says: \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value:\" then \" (6, 2, 2, 1) \" etc. But in the description, it says \" ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 ) \" so for (6,2,2,1), it might be (x,y) = (6,2), value=2, life_span=1? But value should be +1 or -1, but here it's 2? That can't be.\n> \n> Look: \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value: - (6, 2, 2, 1)\" but it says \"Value and Life Span\", and in core rules, food has value +1 or -1, but here it's numbers like 2 and 1.\n> \n> Perhaps it's a typo or I misread.\n> \n> Input: \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value: - (6, 2, 2, 1) - (1, 2, 4, 1) - (4, 3, 7, 1) - (5, 3, 10, 1)\"\n> \n> But in the core rules, food has value which is +1 or -1, and life_span.\n> \n> Here, for (6,2,2,1), it might be (x,y, life_span, value) or (x,y, value, life_span)? Value is supposed to be +1 or -1, but 2 and 1 are given, which are not -1.\n> \n> Perhaps it's (x,y, value, life_span) and value can be other numbers? But core rules say positive food +1, negative food -1.\n> \n> Let's read core rules: \"Positive Food - Reward Value = +1\" and \"Negative Food - Penalty Value = -1\"\n> \n> But in the state, it's given as numbers like 2 and 1, which are not +1 or -1. That must be a mistake.\n> \n> Perhaps the food value is listed as the third number, and life span as fourth.\n> \n> For (6,2,2,1): x=6,y=2, value=2, life_span=1? But value should be +1 or -1, not 2.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,2,4,1): x=1,y=2, value=4, life_span=1\n> \n> (4,3,7,1): x=4,y=3, value=7, life_span=1\n> \n> (5,3,10,1): x=5,y=3, value=10, life_span=1\n> \n> But all values are positive and greater than 1, which contradicts the core rules. Core rules say value is +1 for positive, -1 for negative.\n> \n> Perhaps in this case, all food is positive, but with different values? But core rules say \"Reward Value = +1\" for positive food.\n> \n> I think there might be a misunderstanding.\n> \n> Look at the state input format: \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span: - ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 )\" so for example, \"(6, 2, 2, 1)\" should be interpreted as (x,y) = (6,2), value = 2, life_span = 1.\n> \n> But core rules say value is +1 for positive food. Here value is 2, which is not +1.\n> \n> Similarly, all have values like 2,4,7,10, all positive, and life_span 1 for all except one has 2.\n> \n> (6,2,2,1) has value=2, life_span=1? Or is it (x,y, life_span, value)?\n> \n> The text says \" (6, 2, 2, 1) \" and \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value\", so it's ambiguous.\n> \n> But in the core rules, it's specified as value and life_span.\n> \n> Perhaps for this game, the value can be different, but core rules say +1 for positive.\n> \n> I think I should go by the state given. In the state, it's listed as numbers, so I'll assume that the value is the third number, and life_span the fourth, so for (6,2,2,1), it's x=6,y=2, value=2, life_span=1.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,2,4,1): x=1,y=2, value=4, life_span=1\n> \n> (4,3,7,1): x=4,y=3, value=7, life_span=1\n> \n> (5,3,10,1): x=5,y=3, value=10, life_span=1\n> \n> But all life_span are 1 except for (6,2,2,1) which has life_span=1? 2,1 so value=2, life_span=1.\n> \n> (6,2,2,1) means value=2, life_span=1? Or value=1, life_span=2? The text says \"Life Span and Value\" but the numbers are listed as (x,y, a, b).\n> \n> Perhaps it's (x,y, life_span, value).\n> \n> For (6,2,2,1): if life_span=2, value=1.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,2,4,1): life_span=4, value=1\n> \n> (4,3,7,1): life_span=7, value=1\n> \n> (5,3,10,1): life_span=10, value=1\n> \n> Yes, that makes sense because value is 1 for all, which is +1, and life_span varies.\n> \n> For (6,2,2,1): x=6,y=2, life_span=2, value=1\n> \n> (1,2,4,1): x=1,y=2, life_span=4, value=1\n> \n> (4,3,7,1): x=4,y=3, life_span=7, value=1\n> \n> (5,3,10,1): x=5,y=3, life_span=10, value=1\n> \n> All positive food with value +1, different life spans.\n> \n> Okay, that resolves that.\n> \n> So food at:\n> \n> - (6,2) with life_span=2, value=1\n> \n> - (1,2) with life_span=4, value=1\n> \n> - (4,3) with life_span=7, value=1\n> \n> - (5,3) with life_span=10, value=1\n> \n> Now, current turn t1=64.\n> \n> Snake head at (2,2), direction D (down, so facing increasing y if y down).\n> \n> Walls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and internal obstacle at (1,6).\n> \n> Snake positions: let's list the cells to visualize.\n> \n> Grid from (0,0) top-left to (7,7) bottom-right, y increasing down.\n> \n> Head at (2,2), direction D, so can move U, D, L, R but not U (since reverse of D is U, so cannot move U immediately).\n> \n> No instant reverse: cannot move opposite to current direction.

Snake positions: (2,2), (2,3) is the first body segment, so moving to (2,3) would be body collision, deadly.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,2): is it occupied? Snake positions: (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2)\n> \n> So (1,2) is not in the list; let's see: (1,3) is there, but (1,2) is not listed, so it should be free, but is it a wall? Walls are borders and internal. Borders x=0,7 y=0,7, so (1,2) is not border. Internal obstacle only (1,6), so (1,2) should be free.\n> \n> Similarly, (3,2): not in snake positions, not wall.\n> \n> Also, (6,2) is a body segment? (6,2) is in positions: (6,2) is the 13th segment, I think, but let's count.\n> \n> Positions: index 0: (2,2) head, 1: (2,3), 2: (1,3), 3: (1,4), 4: (2,4), 5: (2,5), 6: (3,5), 7: (4,5), 8: (5,5), 9: (5,4), 10: (6,4), 11: (6,3), 12: (6,2), 13: (6,1), 14: (5,1), 15: (4,1), 16: (4,2) tail.\n> \n> So (6,2) is position 12, which is a body segment.\n> \n> But for moving, when the snake moves, the tail will move, so if head moves to a cell, it's only deadly if it collides with body except the tail, because the tail moves away.\n> \n> Core rules: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n> \n> So moving to the tail cell is safe, as long as it's the current tail and it moves.\n> \n> In this case, from (2,2), moving to (1,2) or (3,2) or (2,3) but (2,3) is body segment, not tail, so collision if move there.\n> \n> (2,3) is position 1, not tail, so moving to (2,3) would cause collision with body.\n> \n> Similarly, moving to (1,2): not occupied by body or wall, so safe.\n> \n> Moving to (3,2): similarly safe.\n> \n> Now, food at (1,2), (4,3), (5,3), (6,2) but (6,2) is occupied by body, and we have a rule about that.\n> \n> Food can be under body, but can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves there.\n> \n> Currently, food at (6,2) which is occupied by body segment.\n> \n> Life_span for food: for (6,2) life_span=2, but current turn 64, life_span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 64, it has life_span 2, meaning it will disappear after 2 more turns? Life_span decreases every turn, so if life_span=N at turn t, it disappears after N turns, meaning it can be eaten until turn t+N-1 or something.\n> \n> The rule: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\", and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So at turn t, if life_span is S, it decreases to S-1 at turn t+1, and so on, until S=0, it disappears. So it exists for S turns including the current turn.\n> \n> For example, S=2 at turn t: exists at t and t+1, disappears at t+2.\n> \n> Similarly, S=1: exists only at t, disappears at t+1.\n> \n> In this case, food at (6,2) has life_span=2 at turn 64, so it exists at turn 64 and 65, disappears at 66.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,2) life_span=4, exists until turn 67?

Possible moves: since head is moving right, I can go U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), R (right, x+1), but not L (left, x-1) because that would be an instant reverse, which is not allowed. The rule says: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\" Current direction is R, so opposite is L, so I cannot move left on this turn.

It's the 14th segment: positions list has (6,2) as index 13? Let's index them.\n> \n> Snake positions in order: index 0: (3,2) head, 1: (2,2), 2: (2,3), 3: (1,3), 4: (1,4), 5: (2,4), 6: (2,5), 7: (3,5), 8: (4,5), 9: (5,5), 10: (5,4), 11: (6,4), 12: (6,3), 13: (6,2), 14: (6,1), 15: (5,1), 16: (4,1) tail.\n> \n> So (6,2) is occupied by the snake's body at index 13.\n> \n> But there's food at (6,2) with life span 1. The food mechanics say: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if the body moves away and the head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> So for (6,2), since it's under the body, I can only eat it if that body segment moves away, and then I move the head there.\n> \n> But life span is 1, meaning it disappears after this turn, including current turn. So on turn 65, if I don't eat it, it will be gone.\n> \n> To eat it, I need the head to move to (6,2) after the body has moved away.\n> \n> But (6,2) is currently occupied by the snake, so I can't move there now. The snake can't move to a cell it occupies except for the tail, because the tail moves.\n> \n> General rule: when the snake moves, the head goes to a new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment before it, and the tail segment is removed if no food is eaten, or a new segment is added if food is eaten.\n> \n> Specifically for food under body: to eat it, the body must move away first, then head can move there later.\n> \n> For (6,2), it's the 13th segment. When the snake moves, the tail end moves forward, so if no food is eaten, the tail at (4,1) will be removed, and a new head position is added.\n> \n> But for (6,2), since it's not the tail, it won't move away immediately.\n> \n> Let's simulate one move.\n> \n> Current turn 65, snake head at (3,2), direction R.\n> \n> Possible moves: U, D, R.\n> \n> If I move right to (4,2), then new head is (4,2), body segments shift: segment 1 (2,2) moves to where head was? No.\n> \n> Standard snake movement: when the snake moves, the head moves to a new cell, then each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead of it. So the segment that was at position i moves to position i-1, for i from 1 to len-1.\n> \n> After moving, the positions are updated.\n> \n> For example, if head moves to (4,2), then:\n> \n> - New head: (4,2)\n> \n> - Segment 1: was (2,2), but now it moves to the old head position? No.\n> \n> Let's think: the positions list: after moving right, head goes to (4,2), then the first body segment (index 1, (2,2)) moves to the old head position (3,2)? But (3,2) is where head was, but now head is at (4,2), so the body segment that was behind head moves to (3,2).\n> \n> Generally: new head position based on move, then each subsequent segment takes the position of the previous segment in the list.\n> \n> So positions after move: new head at (new_x, new_y), then position 1 is old head (3,2), position 2 is old position 1 (2,2), position 3 is old position 2 (2,3), and so on, up to position 16 is old position 15 (5,1), and old position 16 (4,1) is removed if no food eaten.\n> \n> If no food eaten, the tail is removed, so the snake shortens by one? No, in snake game, when no food is eaten, the snake moves, head to new position, each body segment follows, so the tail position is vacated.\n> \n> Specifically: the number of segments remains the same unless food is eaten. If no food, the tail end cell is left empty.\n> \n> In terms of positions list: if head moves to new cell without eating, the new positions are: [new_head] + positions[:-1], so the last position is removed.\n> \n> For example, 17 segments, after move no eat: 17 positions, but the last one is dropped, so new positions have 17 segments? No.\n> \n> Start with positions: P0, P1, P2, ..., P16 (17 positions, P0 head, P16 tail).\n> \n> After moving head to new cell N:\n> \n> - New head: N\n> \n> - New position 1: old P0\n> \n> - New position 2: old P1\n> \n> - ...\n> \n> - New position 16: old P15\n> \n> - Old P16 is removed, no longer occupied.\n> \n> So the snake has the same number of segments, but the tail has moved.\n> \n> If food is eaten, new head at food position, and a new segment is added at the tail, so positions: [new_head] + positions, so the tail stays, and a new tail is added? Standard: when food eaten, head moves to food cell, and a new segment is added at the tail, so the tail doesn't move, and a new position is added.\n> \n> Example: if head moves to food at F, then new positions: [F] + positions, so old positions all remain, and new head at F, so the snake grows by one segment.\n> \n> Similarly, if no food, new positions: [new_head] + positions[:-1], so the last position is removed, snake length same.\n> \n> Back to food at (6,2): it is currently occupied by the snake at position 13 (index 13, which is (6,2)).\n> \n> To eat this food, the body must move away first. That means that on some turn, when the snake moves, the segment at (6,2) moves to another position, vacating (6,2), and then on a subsequent turn, the head can move to (6,2) to eat the food.\n> \n> But the food has life span 1, so it disappears after turn 65. That means if it's not eaten on turn 65, it's gone. But since it's under the body, I can't eat it on turn 65 because the head can't move to (6,2) while it's occupied. And even if I could, it's not the head moving there with the body gone; the body is there now.\n> \n> The rule: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n> \n> For turn 65, (6,2) is occupied, so I can't eat it now. After the move, if the segment moves, but life span decreases, so after turn 65, if not eaten, it disappears.\n> \n> Life span: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) | Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n> \n> So for food at (6,2) with life span 1, on turn 65, if not eaten, it disappears after this turn. So I cannot eat it at all, because it's under the body and will be gone after this turn. There's no opportunity to eat it later.\n> \n> Therefore, the food at (6,2) is not eatable; I should ignore it.\n> \n> Similarly, other food: (1,2) with life 3, (4,3) with life 6, (5,3) with life 9.\n> \n> Now, let's see the grid.\n> \n> I should map the grid to see free cells and obstacles.\n> \n> Grid from (0,0) to (7,7).

The grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So coordinates range from (0,0) to (7,7), but (0,0) is a corner wall, so playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6)? Walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, meaning cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls.

Also internal obstacle at (1,6).\n> \n> Snake positions:\n> \n> - Head: (5,2)\n> \n> - Then: (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1)\n> \n> Tail is (6,1).\n> \n> Current direction: R (right), so from (5,2), moving right would go to (6,2), but (6,2) is occupied by the snake body? Let's see: positions include (6,2) and (6,1), etc.\n> \n> List all snake positions to avoid:\n> \n> (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1)\n> \n> So, cells occupied by snake: all these points.\n> \n> Food:\n> \n> - (1,2) - life span 2, so if not eaten by turn 68, it disappears? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 67, life span 2 means it has 2 turns left: after turn 67, it becomes 1, after turn 68 it disappears. Similarly for others.\n> \n> Turn 67: life span 2, so after this turn (if not eaten), it will have life span 1 for turn 68, and after turn 68, if not eaten, it disappears.\n> \n> Similarly, (4,3) life span 4: after turn 67, 3 left; turn 68, 2 left; etc.\n> \n> Now, current head at (5,2), moving right. Possible moves: U (up, to (5,3)), D (down, to (5,1)), L (left, to (4,2)), R (right, to (6,2)).\n> \n> But (6,2) is occupied by snake body? Let's check: (6,2) is in the positions, it's the 15th segment or something. Positions: index 0: (5,2) head, 1: (4,2), 2: (3,2), 3: (2,2), 4: (2,3), 5: (1,3), 6: (1,4), 7: (2,4), 8: (2,5), 9: (3,5), 10: (4,5), 11: (5,5), 12: (5,4), 13: (6,4), 14: (6,3), 15: (6,2), 16: (6,1) tail.\n> \n> So (6,2) is occupied by the body segment at index 15. Since the head is moving, if it moves to (6,2), it would collide with the body because that cell is occupied and not the tail that will move away.\n> \n> Rule: body collision if head touches any body segment except the tail, but when moving, if head moves to a cell that will be vacated by the tail, it's ok, but here (6,2) is not the tail; tail is (6,1).\n> \n> Let's think carefully.\n> \n> When the snake moves, the head moves to a new cell, and the tail moves away from its current cell, so cells that were body might be free after move.\n> \n> But for collision, the head cannot move to a cell that is occupied by any body segment at the time of move, except that it can move to the tail's current position because the tail will move, so that cell becomes free.\n> \n> Standard snake rules: head moves to new cell; if it's food, tail doesn't move, so snake grows; if not, tail moves one step.\n> \n> Collision: if head moves to a cell that is occupied by any part of the body except that it can move to the tail's current position because when the tail moves, that cell is vacated, so no collision.\n> \n> In this case, for turn 67, head at (5,2), moving to (6,2): (6,2) is currently occupied by the snake body (index 15). But after the move, the tail will move from (6,1), so (6,2) will be occupied by the head, and the body segment that was at (6,2) will move to where? Let's simulate the movement.\n> \n> When the snake moves, the head goes to a new position, and each segment moves to the position of the previous segment. So if head moves to (6,2), then:\n> \n> - New head: (6,2)\n> \n> - Then the segment that was at (5,2) moves to where head was, but head was at (5,2), so the first body segment (index 1) was (4,2), it moves to (5,2)\n> \n> Similarly, (4,2) to (5,2)? No.\n> \n> Positions sequence: let's number them for clarity.\n> \n> Let S[t] be positions at turn t.\n> \n> At turn 67, positions: P0 = (5,2), P1 = (4,2), P2 = (3,2), P3 = (2,2), P4 = (2,3), P5 = (1,3), P6 = (1,4), P7 = (2,4), P8 = (2,5), P9 = (3,5), P10 = (4,5), P11 = (5,5), P12 = (5,4), P13 = (6,4), P14 = (6,3), P15 = (6,2), P16 = (6,1)\n> \n> Head direction R, so if we move right, head goes to (6,2).\n> \n> But (6,2) is currently P15, occupied.\n> \n> After move:\n> \n> - New head: (6,2)  // this was P15\n> \n> - Then P0 moves to (6,2)? No, the new position for index 0 is (6,2)\n> \n> Index 1 (was P1 (4,2)) moves to P0's old position (5,2)\n> \n> Index 2 (was P2 (3,2)) moves to P1's old position (4,2)\n> \n> ...\n> \n> Index 15 (was P15 (6,2)) moves to P14's old position (6,3)? P14 is (6,3), which is index 14.\n> \n> Let's think of the positions after move.\n> \n> When head moves to a new cell, say new_head_pos.\n> \n> Then the new body segments are: old_head_pos, followed by the old body segments except the last one if no food eaten.\n> \n> If no food eaten, the tail moves away, so the last segment is removed.\n> \n> So if head moves to new_pos, and new_pos is not food, then:\n> \n> - New positions: [new_pos, old_head, old_body[0], old_body[1], ..., old_body[-2]]  because the tail is removed.\n> \n> In terms of indices:\n> \n> New position 0: new_head\n> \n> New position 1: old position 0 (head)\n> \n> New position 2: old position 1\n> \n> ...\n> \n> New position k: old position k-1 for k from 1 to len-1\n> \n> Then the last old position is vacated.\n> \n> For collision: if the new_head position is the same as any of the old body positions (except the tail position if it's moving away), but since the tail moves away, it's safe to move to the tail's current position.\n> \n> Otherwise, if it's any other body position, it's a collision because that cell is occupied and won't be vacated.\n> \n> In this case, for moving to (6,2):\n> \n> Current positions: (6,2) is occupied by index 15, which is not the tail; tail is index 16 (6,1).\n> \n> So if head moves to (6,2), it would be moving to a cell occupied by index 15, which is not the tail, so collision occurs, snake dies.\n> \n> Similarly, if moving to a cell that is any body segment except the tail.\n> \n> Tail is index 16 (6,1), so moving to (6,1) would be safe because the tail will move away.\n> \n> But (6,1) is down from (5,2), which is D.\n> \n> Let's list possible moves from (5,2):\n> \n> - U: to (5,3)\n> \n> - D: to (5,1)\n> \n> - L: to (4,2)\n> \n> - R: to (6,2)\n> \n> Now, check each:\n> \n> - (5,3): is this occupied? Current positions: let's see, (5,3) not in list? Positions: (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1). So (5,3) is not listed, so it's empty? But there is food at (5,3), which is one of the food positions.\n> \n> Food at (5,3) with value 1, life 7.\n> \n> But (5,3) is not in snake positions, so it should be free, except for possible food or wall.\n> \n> Walls: borders and (1,6), so (5,3) should be free.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,1): is it occupied? Not in positions, so free. But y=1, not wall yet, x=5,y=1, borders are x=0,x=7,y=0,y=7, so (5,1) is within bounds.\n> \n> (4,2): is occupied by index 1, which is body, not tail. Tail is (6,1), so moving left to (4,2) would be collision because (4,2) is occupied by body.\n> \n> (6,2): occupied by index 15, collision.\n> \n> So only possible moves without immediate collision: U to (5,3) or D to (5,1).\n> \n> Also, cannot move opposite to current direction. Current direction is R (right), so opposite is L (left). But moving L to (4,2) is invalid anyway due to collision, so only U and D are possible and safe from immediate collision.\n> \n> U: to (5,3)\n> \n> D: to (5,1)\n> \n> Now, (5,3) has food? Yes, food at (5,3) with value 1.\n> \n> Similarly, (5,1) has no food mentioned, so probably empty.\n> \n> But I need to think ahead.\n> \n> Also, food at (1,2) with life span 2, so it will disappear after turn 68, meaning if not eaten by turn 68, it's gone. Turn 67 and 68 are the last chances.\n> \n> Similarly, others have more life.\n> \n> Now, tail position is (6,1), and head is at (5,2), so they are adjacent: (5,2) and (6,1) are not adjacent? Adjacent means sharing a side, so up, down, left, right.\n> \n> (5,2) and (6,1): not sharing a side; (5,2) right is (6,2), down is (5,1), etc. (6,1) is down-right, but not adjacent horizontally or vertically.\n> \n> So no immediate tail reward danger.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan a sequence for 5+ turns.\n> \n> First, let's consider moving up to (5,3) or down to (5,1).\n> \n> If I move up to (5,3), that is food, so I eat it, snake grows, so length increases by 1, and I get +1 score.\n> \n> After eating, the tail doesn't move, so positions: new head at (5,3), then old head (5,2), then the rest, and tail stays, so new positions: head (5,3), then (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), ..., up to (6,1), and since I ate, tail doesn't move, so the new tail is still (6,1), but the segment that was tail is now part of body, and a new segment is added at head? No.\n> \n> When you eat food, the head moves to the food cell, and the tail doesn't move, so the snake grows by one segment. So the new positions are: [new_head] + all old positions.\n> \n> So old positions: 17 segments.\n> \n> After move to (5,3) and eat, new positions: head (5,3), then old positions from index 0 to 16: (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1)\n> \n> So now 18 segments, tail at (6,1).\n> \n> But (6,1) is still the tail? In the list, index 17 is (6,1), tail.\n> \n> After growth, the tail doesn't move, so it stays.\n> \n> Now, head direction: since I moved U, new direction is U.\n> \n> Now, from (5,3), possible moves: U to (5,4), D to (5,2), L to (4,3), R to (6,3).\n> \n> But (5,4) is occupied by old position, which is now index 12? New positions: index 0: (5,3), 1: (5,2), 2: (4,2), ..., up to 17: (6,1)\n> \n> (5,4) is position of index 12? Let's find: from above, after growth, position 12 is (5,4)? Old positions: after move, position 0: (5,3), position 1: (5,2), position 2: (4,2), position 3: (3,2), position 4: (2,2), position 5: (2,3), position 6: (1,3), position 7: (1,4), position 8: (2,4), position 9: (2,5), position 10: (3,5), position 11: (4,5), position 12: (5,5), position 13: (5,4)? Old positions had (5,4) at index 12? Earlier: before move, index 12 was (5,4), but after move and growth, let's list new positions:\n> \n> - 0: (5,3) head\n> \n> - 1: (5,2)  // old head\n> \n> - 2: (4,2)  // old body 1\n> \n> - 3: (3,2)  // old body 2\n> \n> - 4: (2,2)  // old body 3\n> \n> - 5: (2,3)  // old body 4\n> \n> - 6: (1,3)  // old body 5\n> \n> - 7: (1,4)  // old body 6\n> \n> - 8: (2,4)  // old body 7\n> \n> - 9: (2,5)  // old body 8\n> \n> - 10: (3,5)  // old body 9\n> \n> - 11: (4,5)  // old body 10\n> \n> - 12: (5,5)  // old body 11\n> \n> - 13: (5,4)  // old body 12\n> \n> - 14: (6,4)  // old body 13\n> \n> - 15: (6,3)  // old body 14\n> \n> - 16: (6,2)  // old body 15\n> \n> - 17: (6,1)  // old body 16/tail\n> \n> So (5,4) is occupied by index 13.\n> \n> (6,3) by index 15, etc.\n> \n> Now, from (5,3), move U to (5,4): (5,4) is occupied by index 13, which is body, not tail, so collision.\n> \n> Move D to (5,2): (5,2) is occupied by index 1, body, collision.\n> \n> Move L to (4,3): (4,3) is not in positions, and not wall, so free?

But (5,4) is occupied by the snake's body? Let's check the positions.\n> \n> Snake positions: (5,3) head, then (5,2), but (5,4) is also a body segment? List in order:\n> \n> Positions: index 0: (5,3) head, 1: (5,2), 2: (4,2), 3: (3,2), 4: (2,2), 5: (2,3), 6: (1,3), 7: (1,4), 8: (2,4), 9: (2,5), 10: (3,5), 11: (4,5), 12: (5,5), 13: (5,4), 14: (6,4), 15: (6,3), 16: (6,2), 17: (6,1) tail.\n> \n> So (5,4) is position 13, which is part of the body. But when the snake moves, the tail moves, so cells can free up.\n> \n> Since head is at (5,3) and direction is Up, moving Up to (5,4) might be possible if that cell is not occupied after movement.\n> \n> When the snake moves, the head moves to a new cell, and each segment moves to the next position, so the tail leaves its current cell.\n> \n> So at turn t, before movement, positions are as given.\n> \n> If I move Up from (5,3) to (5,4), then new head is (5,4), and the body shifts: (5,3) becomes the new neck, (5,2) moves to (4,2) or something? Let's think carefully.\n> \n> The snake positions list is in order: head, then body segments to tail.\n> \n> When the head moves to a new cell, that becomes the new head position. Then each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment. So the tail segment is left, freeing that cell.\n> \n> But if the head moves to a food cell, the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move, and a new segment is added at the tail.\n> \n> In this case, for movement without eating, the tail moves forward.\n> \n> But here, we might eat food.\n> \n> First, possible moves from current position (5,3) with direction Up.\n> \n> Possible directions: Up (U) to (5,4), Down (D) to (5,2), Left (L) to (4,3), Right (R) to (6,3).\n> \n> But no instant reverse: since current direction is Up, I cannot move Down, because Down is opposite to Up. So Down is not allowed.\n> \n> Also, need to check if the cells are free or walls.\n> \n> Walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, so all cells with x=0,7 or y=0,7 are invalid.\n> \n> Internal obstacle at (1,6), so (1,6) is blocked.\n> \n> Now, from (5,3):\n> \n> - Up (U) to (5,4): (5,4) is currently occupied by the snake at position 13. But after movement, if no food eaten, the tail at (6,1) will move, so (5,4) might be free? No.\n> \n> When moving, the head moves to (5,4), but (5,4) is currently occupied, so it would be a collision unless that cell is the tail and we move into it.\n> \n> General rule: moving into a cell occupied by the body is deadly, except if it's the tail cell, because the tail will move away.\n> \n> In this case, (5,4) is not the tail; tail is (6,1). (5,4) is position 13, which is part of the body, not the tail. So if I move to (5,4), it's a body collision and I die.\n> \n> Similarly, Down to (5,2): (5,2) is position 1, body segment, not tail, so collision. But also, Down is reverse direction, which is not allowed anyway.\n> \n> Left to (4,3): (4,3) is not in the snake positions? Let's see: positions are (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1)\n> \n> (4,3) is not listed, so it should be free? (4,3) is not in the positions, and it's within bounds: x=4, y=3, which is between 1 and 6, not wall, not obstacle. Obstacle is only (1,6), so (4,3) should be empty.\n> \n> Right to (6,3): (6,3) is position 15, body segment, not tail. (6,3) is occupied.\n> \n> (6,3) is in positions: index 15, yes.\n> \n> So possible moves:\n> \n> - Up to (5,4): occupied by body, collision\n> \n> - Down to (5,2): occupied and reverse, not allowed\n> \n> - Left to (4,3): empty? Let's confirm: positions have (4,2), (4,5), but not (4,3). So (4,3) is free. And food at (4,3) is one of the foods, with value 1.\n> \n> - Right to (6,3): occupied by body at (6,3), position 15.\n> \n> (6,3) is body, so moving there would be collision.\n> \n> Therefore, only possible move is Left to (4,3).\n> \n> But (4,3) has food! Food at (4,3) with value 1 and life span 3.\n> \n> If I move to (4,3), I eat the food, so snake grows: head moves to (4,3), and since food is eaten, tail doesn't move, so new snake positions: head at (4,3), then previous head (5,3) becomes body, and so on, up to tail at (6,1) still there, and length increases by one.\n> \n> Then, since I ate food, score increases by 1.\n> \n> But I need to think ahead.\n> \n> Also, there is food at (1,2) with life span 1, so if I don't eat it this turn, it disappears.\n> \n> But to eat (1,2), I would need to go to (1,2), which is far, and I can only move left to (4,3) now, so I can't reach (1,2) this turn.

So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), but with walls on the borders and an obstacle at (1,6).\n> \n> Snake positions: The head is at (4,3), and the direction is Left (L).

Life span decreases every turn, including current. So if life span is 9 on turn 69, it will last until turn 77 (since it decreases each turn: turn 69: life=9, turn 70: life=8, ..., turn 77: life=1, then disappears after that, so it can be eaten up to turn 77).\n> \n> Now, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks.

No, border cells are walls, so x=0 and x=7 are walls, y=0 and y=7 are walls.

So head is at (3,4), then the body segments follow: (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3). That's 19 segments, so the snake is 19 units long.\n> \n> Snake head direction: Currently moving Left (L), since the head is at (3,4) and the next segment is (4,4), which is to the right, so yes, moving left means decreasing x.\n> \n> Food:\n> - (5,6) with life span 7 and value 1 (positive food)\n> - (3,2) with life span 9 and value 1 (positive food)\n> \n> Both foods are positive, so eating them increases length by 1. No negative food here.\n> \n> Life span: For (5,6), life span 7, which means it disappears after 7 turns, including the current turn. So on turn 71, life span 7, so it will disappear after turn 77 (71 + 6 more turns? Let's think carefully.\n> \n> Life span decreases every turn, including the current one. So if life span is N at turn t, it will disappear after turn t + N - 1. For example:\n> - At turn t, life span N\n> - After turn t, life span becomes N-1\n> - After turn t+1, life span N-2, and so on, until after turn t + N - 1, life span becomes 0, and it disappears before turn t + N.\n> \n> So for (5,6) at turn 71, life span 7: it will be present on turns 71,72,73,74,75,76,77. After turn 77, before turn 78, it disappears. Similarly for (3,2), life span 9: present from turn 71 to 79 inclusive.\n> \n> Now, I need to plan an action sequence for at least 5 turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks. Since the snake is long, 19 segments, the board might be crowded.\n> \n> First, let's visualize the grid. I'll sketch a 7x7 grid for x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, since borders are walls.\n> \n> - Walls: (0,y) for all y, (7,y) for all y, (x,0) for all x, (x,7) for all x. Also internal obstacle at (1,6).\n> \n> So playable cells: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except (1,6) is blocked.\n> \n> Now snake positions:\n> Head: (3,4)\n> Body: (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3)\n> \n> Let's list all occupied cells by snake:\n> \n> - (3,4) - head\n> - (4,4)\n> - (4,3)\n> - (5,3)\n> - (5,2)\n> - (4,2)\n> - (3,2)\n> - (2,2)\n> - (2,3)\n> - (1,3)\n> - (1,4)\n> - (2,4)\n> - (2,5)\n> - (3,5)\n> - (4,5)\n> - (5,5)\n> - (5,4)\n> - (6,4)\n> - (6,3)\n> \n> That's 19 positions.\n> \n> Now, food at:\n> - (5,6) - this is within bounds? x=5,y=6. y=6 is not wall? Walls are y=0 and y=7, so y=6 is playable. But (1,6) is obstacle, so (5,6) should be fine.\n> - (3,2) - also playable.\n> \n> (3,2) is occupied by the snake? Let's see: (3,2) is in the snake positions, it's the 7th segment: positions are [(3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), ...] so (3,2) is a body segment.\n> \n> Food at (3,2) with life span 9 and value 1. But the snake is currently on (3,2)? No, the head is at (3,4), and (3,2) is a body segment. According to the rules, food can spawn under the snake's body, but it can only be eaten if the body moves away and then the head moves onto it.\n> \n> Similarly, for (5,6), that seems free.\n> \n> Current head direction is L, meaning left, so decreasing x.\n> \n> From (3,4), moving left would go to (2,4). But (2,4) is occupied? Let's see the positions: (2,4) is in the list, it's the 12th segment? Positions: index 0: (3,4), 1: (4,4), 2: (4,3), 3: (5,3), 4: (5,2), 5: (4,2), 6: (3,2), 7: (2,2), 8: (2,3), 9: (1,3), 10: (1,4), 11: (2,4), 12: (2,5), 13: (3,5), 14: (4,5), 15: (5,5), 16: (5,4), 17: (6,4), 18: (6,3)\n> \n> (2,4) is position index 11, which is a body segment. But when the snake moves, the tail moves, so the cell (2,4) might be freed if the snake moves away.\n> \n> I need to think about possible moves for the next turn.\n> \n> Current head at (3,4), direction L, so moving left to (2,4) is possible? (2,4) is currently occupied, but since the snake will move, the tail will move, so (2,4) might not be occupied after the move, depending on where the head goes.\n> \n> General movement: when the head moves to a new cell, the tail end is removed, unless food is eaten. So if no food eaten, snake moves by adding a new head and removing the tail.\n> \n> So at turn 71, head at (3,4). I choose a direction to move.\n> \n> Possible moves from (3,4):\n> - Up (U): (3,5)\n> - Down (D): (3,3)\n> - Left (L): (2,4) - but currently occupied by body\n> - Right (R): (4,4) - but currently occupied by body segment at index 1\n> \n> (4,4) is the next segment, so moving right would cause collision, because head would move to (4,4) which is immediately behind it, but since it's moving, let's see.\n> \n> Collision rules: head touches any body segment except the tail, because the tail moves away. Specifically, if the head moves to a cell that will be occupied by a body segment after the move, it collides.\n> \n> When the snake moves:\n> - Head moves to new position.\n> - Each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n> - The tail segment is removed.\n> \n> So, for a move to be safe, the new head position must not be occupied by any body segment except possibly the current tail position, because the tail will move away.\n> \n> In this case, current positions:\n> \n> Head: (3,4)\n> Segment 1: (4,4)  // right of head\n> Segment 2: (4,3)  // down from (4,4)\n> ... and so on.\n> \n> Tail: (6,3)\n> \n> If I move left to (2,4), (2,4) is currently segment 11. After moving head to (2,4), the body segments will shift: segment 1 moves to old head (3,4), segment 2 to segment 1's old position (4,4), and so on, up to segment 18 moves to segment 17's position, and segment 18 old position (6,3) is vacated.\n> \n> The key point: the new head position (2,4) is currently occupied by segment 11. After the move, segment 11 will be at a different position. Specifically, when head moves, segment 1 moves to (3,4), segment 2 to (4,4), ..., segment 11 moves to the position of segment 10, which is (1,4), and so on.\n> \n> Since (2,4) is not the tail, and it's occupied before the move, moving to (2,4) would cause the head to collide with the body segment there immediately, because at the time of move, that cell is occupied and not vacated yet.\n> \n> The collision happens if the new head position is occupied by any part of the snake's body except the very end (the tail cell), because the tail moves away.\n> \n> In this case, (2,4) is not the tail; the tail is at (6,3). So moving to (2,4) would cause collision since it's a body segment.\n> \n> Similarly, moving right to (4,4): (4,4) is segment 1, which is not the tail, so collision.\n> \n> Moving up to (3,5): (3,5) is segment 13 in the list? Positions: (3,5) is index 13, which is a body segment. Not tail, so collision if moved there.\n> \n> Moving down to (3,3): what is at (3,3)? Looking at the positions, (3,3) is not listed. Let's list all occupied cells:\n> \n> From snake positions:\n> (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3)\n> \n> So cells occupied: let's list coordinates:\n> \n> (1,3), (1,4)\n> (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5)\n> (3,2), (3,4), (3,5)  // missing (3,3)\n> (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)\n> (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5)\n> (6,3), (6,4)\n> \n> And (3,3) is not occupied, and not a wall.\n> \n> Also, (3,1) might be possible, but y=1 to 6, (3,1) is within bounds? y=0 is wall, so y=1 is playable.\n> \n> y from 1 to 6, x from 1 to 6.\n> \n> (3,3) is free? From above, not listed, so yes.\n> \n> Similarly, (1,5) might be free, etc.\n> \n> Back to possible moves from (3,4):\n> \n> - Up: to (3,5) - but (3,5) is occupied by segment 13, which is body, not tail, so collision.\n> \n> - Down: to (3,3) - not occupied, so possible.\n> \n> - Left: to (2,4) - occupied by segment 11, not tail, collision.\n> \n> - Right: to (4,4) - occupied by segment 1, not tail, collision.\n> \n> Therefore, the only possible move without immediate collision is Down to (3,3).\n> \n> But is that safe? Also, need to consider walls: (3,3) is within bounds, no wall.\n> \n> Now, head direction: current direction is L (left), so moving down is not reverse, since reverse would be right or left? Directions: U, D, L, R.\n> \n> Current direction L, so opposite is R. Down is perpendicular, so allowed. No instant reverse, but down is fine.\n> \n> So for turn 71, I must move down to (3,3), otherwise I die immediately.\n> \n> But let's confirm the food at (3,2). (3,2) has food, but it's under a body segment now? (3,2) is segment 6 in positions, occupied.\n> \n> But after moving, if I go to (3,3), then the snake moves: new head at (3,3), then body: segment 1 moves to (3,4), segment 2 to (4,4), ..., segment 18 moves to (6,4)? Let's trace the tail.\n> \n> Current positions: indices 0 to 18.\n> \n> After move down to (3,3):\n> \n> - New head: (3,3)\n> - Then segment 0 (old head) becomes new segment 1: (3,4)\n> - Segment 1 old becomes segment 2: (4,4)\n> - Segment 2 old becomes segment 3: (4,3)\n> - Segment 3 old becomes segment 4: (5,3)\n> - Segment 4 old becomes segment 5: (5,2)\n> - Segment 5 old becomes segment 6: (4,2)\n> - Segment 6 old becomes segment 7: (3,2)  // this is where food is\n> - And so on, up to segment 18 old becomes segment 19: (6,3), but since no food eaten, tail is removed, so segment 18 old position (6,3) is vacated.\n> \n> The snake has 19 segments, no food eaten, so after move, new snake has head at (3,3), then segments from old head and body except tail removed.\n> \n> New positions: head (3,3), then body: old positions from index 0 to 17, but shifted.\n> \n> After move:\n> - Position 0 (new head): (3,3)\n> - Position 1: old pos 0 = (3,4)\n> - Position 2: old pos 1 = (4,4)\n> - Position 3: old pos 2 = (4,3)\n> - Position 4: old pos 3 = (5,3)\n> - Position 5: old pos 4 = (5,2)\n> - Position 6: old pos 5 = (4,2)\n> - Position 7: old pos 6 = (3,2)  // food at (3,2) is under this segment now\n> - Position 8: old pos 7 = (2,2)\n> - Position 9: old pos 8 = (2,3)\n> - Position 10: old pos 9 = (1,3)\n> - Position 11: old pos 10 = (1,4)\n> - Position 12: old pos 11 = (2,4)\n> - Position 13: old pos 12 = (2,5)\n> - Position 14: old pos 13 = (3,5)\n> - Position 15: old pos 14 = (4,5)\n> - Position 16: old pos 15 = (5,5)\n> - Position 17: old pos 16 = (5,4)\n> - Position 18: old pos 17 = (6,4)  // tail was old pos 18, which is removed\n> \n> Old tail was (6,3), which is vacated.\n> \n> Now, food at (3,2) is under position 7 of the new snake, so it's covered. But to eat it, the body must move away, then head move onto it.\n> \n> Similarly, food at (5,6) is free.\n> \n> Now, at turn 71, I must move down to (3,3) to avoid collision.\n> \n> Then, for future turns, I need to plan.\n> \n> But I need to output an action sequence starting from turn 71.\n> \n> Turn 71: action must be D (down) to (3,3)\n> \n> Now, after this move, head is at (3,3), and direction was L, but now moving down, so new head direction is D.\n> \n> Now, from (3,3), possible moves for next turn.\n> \n> First, let's list the new snake positions after turn 71 move:\n> \n> Head: (3,3)\n> \n> Body:\n> 1: (3,4)\n> 2: (4,4)\n> 3: (4,3)\n> 4: (5,3)\n> 5: (5,2)\n> 6: (4,2)\n> 7: (3,2)  // food under this\n> 8: (2,2)\n> 9: (2,3)\n> 10: (1,3)\n> 11: (1,4)\n> 12: (2,4)\n> 13: (2,5)\n> 14: (3,5)\n> 15: (4,5)\n> 16: (5,5)\n> 17: (5,4)\n> 18: (6,4)  // new tail\n> \n> And (6,3) is free now.\n> \n> Food: (5,6) and (3,2) but (3,2) is occupied by segment 7.\n> \n> (5,6) is free.\n> \n> Now, head at (3,3), direction D (since just moved down).\n> \n> Possible moves from (3,3):\n> - U: up to (3,4) - but (3,4) is segment 1, which is body, not tail, so collision if move there.\n> - D: down to (3,2) - (3,2) is occupied by segment 7, which is body, not tail, so collision.\n> - L: left to (2,3) - (2,3) is segment 9? Positions: segment 9 is (2,3), which is body, not tail. Tail is at (6,4), so not tail, collision.\n> - R: right to (4,3) - (4,3) is segment 3, body, not tail, collision.\n> \n> (3,4) is seg1, (3,2) is seg7, (2,3) is seg9, (4,3) is seg3, all not tail.\n> \n> But (3,2) has food, but since it's occupied, I can't move there directly.\n> \n> All directions seem blocked?

But are these cells that will be vacated? No, when I move, the body shifts, but the new head position must be free or the tail.\n> \n> Specifically, for a move to (x,y), it must not be occupied by any body segment except the current tail position.\n> \n> Here, tail is at (6,4), which is not adjacent to (3,3), so all adjacent cells are occupied by non-tail segments.\n> \n> Therefore, from (3,3), there is no safe move? But that would mean the snake is trapped and will die on the next turn.\n> \n> But that can't be; I need to think about the movement.\n> \n> After moving to (3,3) on turn 71, for turn 72, when I choose a move, the tail will move again.\n> \n> Current state before turn 72 move: head at (3,3), direction D.\n> \n> If I move, say, right to (4,3), but (4,3) is currently occupied by segment 3.\n> \n> When I move head to (4,3), then:\n> - New head: (4,3)\n> - Segment 1 moves to (3,3) (old head)\n> - Segment 2 moves to (3,4) (old seg1)\n> - Segment 3 moves to (4,4) (old seg2)\n> - And so on, up to segment 18 moves to old seg17 position, and tail old seg18 (6,4) is removed.\n> \n> But at the time of moving, the cell (4,3) is occupied by segment 3, so when the head tries to move there, it collides with the body segment before the move.\n> \n> Similarly for other directions.\n> \n> The only way it's safe is if I move to the tail position, but tail is at (6,4), not adjacent.\n> \n> (3,3) to (6,4) is not adjacent.\n> \n> So indeed, from (3,3), all adjacent cells are occupied by body segments that are not the tail, so any move will cause collision.
