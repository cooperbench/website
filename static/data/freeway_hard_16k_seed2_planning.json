        "thinking": "<think>We are given the current turn t1 = 0 and the player starts at (0,0). The goal is to reach (0,9) in minimal turns H, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways 1 to 8.\n\nPlayer can move: U (up: y+1), D (down: y-1), S (stay: y unchanged). Note that y is bounded between 0 and 9.\n\nImportant: Collision occurs at turn T only if at that turn the player is on a freeway row (y_T) and at the same time the car (on that freeway) has a span that includes the x-coordinate 0 at turn T.\n\nNote: The player's x-coordinate is always 0. We only move vertically.\n\nCar update:\n- Left-moving: the car moves left (negative x direction) with speed s. So at time T, the car's position is shifted left by s*(T - t1) from its initial state at t1.\n- Right-moving: the car moves right (positive x direction) with speed s.\n\nBut note: the car state is given at t1 (which is 0). So for a future turn T, we can compute the car's span.\n\nFor a car at freeway k (which is row k) with initial head h, tail tau, direction d, and speed s:\n- If d is 'right': \n   - At time T, the head becomes h + s*(T - t1) = h + s*T (since t1=0)\n   - The tail becomes tau + s*T.\n   - The span is [tau + s*T, h + s*T] (note: in the table, for right-moving cars, the initial span is given as (head, tail) but the example in the update rule says: for right-moving, initial span [tau, h] becomes [tau + s*T, h + s*T]. However, looking at the table, the cars are given as (head, tail, direction, speed). We must interpret the head and tail appropriately.\n\nBut note the example in the update rule for right-moving: \n   Initial: [tau, h] -> becomes [tau + s*T, h + s*T]\n\nSo the initial head is the rightmost point? and tail the leftmost? Actually, in the update rule it says for right-moving: initial span is [tau, h] meaning from tail (left) to head (right). So in the table, the numbers: for freeway 5: (48,37,right,6) -> this seems inconsistent because 48>37, so if head=48 and tail=37, then the car would be from 37 to 48? But then at time T, it becomes [37+6T, 48+6T]. \n\nSimilarly, for left-moving: the update rule says: initial span [h, tau] (which would be from head (leftmost) to tail (rightmost)) and then becomes [h - s*T, tau - s*T]. But note the example in the table for left-moving: none in this problem? Actually, the table only has right-moving cars.\n\nSo for this problem, all cars are right-moving.\n\nTherefore, for a car (h, tau, 'right', s) at freeway k, at time T (from turn t1=0), the car's span is [tau + s*T, h + s*T].\n\nCollision: if at turn T, the player is at row k (i.e., y_T = k) and the car on row k has a span that includes 0? That is, if:\n   tau + s*T <= 0 <= h + s*T\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T\". \n\nImportant: The player is at (0, y_T) at turn T.\n\nAlso note: when the player moves from y to y+1 (or y-1) at turn T, then at turn T the player is still on the previous row? The note says: if you move to y_{T+1} != y_T at turn T, then you are not considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T. So at turn T, you are on the row y_T (the starting row of that turn) and then at the next turn you move to the next row.\n\nTherefore, when we are at turn T, we are at row y_T, and we check the cars on row y_T at time T.\n\nPlan:\nWe need to go from y0=0 to yH=9. The minimal H in terms of vertical moves is at least 9 (if we always go up). But we might have to wait (use S) to avoid collisions, so H might be more than 9.\n\nWe can model this as a state-space search: state = (time, y). Time starts at 0 and increases. We want to reach (time T, y=9) with minimal T.\n\nBut note: the car positions change with time, so we must simulate the cars at each time step.\n\nConstraints:\n- y must be in [0,9].\n- At each time step t (starting from t1=0), we choose an action a_t in {U, D, S}. Then:\n   y_{t+1} = y_t + delta, where delta = +1 (U), -1 (D), 0 (S).\n\nWe start at time 0, y0=0.\n\nWe must avoid: at each time t (from 0 to T-1, and note at time T we are at the goal and we don't need to check after that? Actually, the last action is at time t1+H-1, and then we are at y_{t1+H} = 9? But note: the sequence of actions is for t from t1 to t1+H-1, and after H-1 actions, we are at turn t1+H-1 and then the position becomes y_{t1+H-1} + ... and that must be 9.\n\nActually, the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning from t1 to t1+H-1. Then after H actions (and H turns have passed, because each action is one turn), the player has moved H steps. But note: the position at turn t1 is given. Then:\n\nAt turn t1: we are at (0, y_{t1}) -> then we choose a_{t1} and that gives y_{t1+1}.\n...\nAt turn t1+H-1: we choose a_{t1+H-1} and that gives y_{t1+H}.\n\nWe require y_{t1+H} = 9.\n\nTherefore, we are at (0,0) at time 0. We need to find the smallest H and actions a_0, a_1, ... a_{H-1} such that after applying these actions, we are at y_H = 9 and we never collided during turns 0 to H-1.\n\nNote: at each turn t (from 0 to H-1), we are at row y_t and we must check the cars on row y_t at time t.\n\nWe do not check at time H because we are done.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Precompute for each freeway row (1 to 8) the set of cars and their movement.\n\n2. For each time step t (starting from 0) and for each y in [0,9], we can define if the state (t, y) is safe: meaning that if the player is at row y at time t, then there is no car on row y at time t that covers 0.\n\nBut note: if y=0 or y=9, there are no cars? The freeways are from y=1 to y=8. So if the player is at y=0 or y=9 at time t, then there is no car to collide with. Therefore, these rows are always safe.\n\n3. We can use BFS (breadth-first search) over the state (t, y). However, note that t can be large? But we are looking for minimal H, and H might be bounded by some maximum. Since we have to go up at least 9 times, and we can also go down, but we are bounded by the grid (0 to 9). Actually, we can design a state (y, t) and we want to minimize t. But note: the car positions are linear in time, so we can compute the safety condition for each time.\n\nHowever, the time might be large? But the cars are moving and eventually the cars that are far away will pass. We can compute the time intervals when a car is covering 0 on a given row.\n\nBut note: for a given car on row k, with (h, tau, 'right', s), the car covers 0 at time t if:\n   tau + s*t <= 0 <= h + s*t   [since at time t, the car's span is [tau+s*t, h+s*t]]\n\nBut note: the initial state is at t=0. So we are solving for t (nonnegative integer) in:\n   tau + s*t <= 0 <= h + s*t\n\nThis is equivalent to:\n   t >= ceil(-h/s)   [if s>0] and t >= ceil(-tau/s) ??? Actually:\n\n   We have two inequalities:\n      tau + s*t <= 0   => t <= -tau/s   [if s>0, note tau is negative?] \n      and 0 <= h + s*t => t >= -h/s.\n\nBut wait: let's see the signs. In the given cars, for freeway 1: (-48, -71, right, 24). \n   tau = -71, h = -48, s=24.\n\nThen the condition: \n   -71 + 24*t <= 0 and -48 + 24*t >= 0.\n\nFirst: -71+24t<=0 -> 24t<=71 -> t<=71/24≈2.96 -> t<=2 (since integer, and the inequality is <=0, so at t=3: 24*3=72>71 -> then -71+72=1>0 -> so the first inequality fails at t=3? Actually, we have to be careful: the condition is for the entire car to cover 0? \n\nBut note: the car is moving right. At time t, the car is from (tau+s*t) to (h+s*t). For freeway1 at time t:\n   left end = -71 + 24*t\n   right end = -48 + 24*t\n\nWe require 0 to be in [left, right] -> left <= 0 <= right.\n\nSo:\n   -71 + 24*t <= 0   => 24*t <= 71 -> t <= 71/24 ≈ 2.958 -> so t<=2 (because t integer, at t=3: -71+24*3=1>0 -> fails)\n   and -48+24*t >=0 -> 24*t>=48 -> t>=2.\n\nSo t must be 2.\n\nSimilarly, for other cars.\n\nBut note: a freeway may have multiple cars. We only need one car to cover 0 to cause a collision.\n\nTherefore, for each row k and each car on row k, we can compute the set of time intervals (if any) when the car covers 0. Then the row k is unsafe at time t if any car on row k covers 0 at time t.\n\nSince the cars move at constant speed, the coverage of 0 by a car is a contiguous interval of time? Actually, for a car, the coverage of 0 is a single contiguous interval? \n\nFor a car with (h, tau, d, s) and d='right':\n\nWe have:\n   t_min = ceil( (-h)/s )? Actually: from the inequalities:\n\n   Condition: left_end <= 0 <= right_end\n      tau + s*t <= 0   -> t <= (-tau)/s\n      h + s*t >= 0    -> t >= (-h)/s\n\nBut note: if h and tau are negative (as in the example), then (-h) and (-tau) are positive.\n\nThe interval for t: [ ceil( (-h)/s ), floor( (-tau)/s ) ]? \n\nBut note: in the example: h=-48, tau=-71, s=24:\n   (-h)/s = 48/24=2, (-tau)/s=71/24≈2.958 -> then t must be in [2, 2.958] -> so integer t=2.\n\nBut what if the interval is not integer? Then we take integer t in [ceil( (-h)/s ), floor( (-tau)/s )]? \n\nActually, the inequalities are:\n   t >= (-h)/s   -> since h is negative, (-h) is positive -> t >= 2.\n   t <= (-tau)/s -> t <= 71/24 ≈2.958 -> so t<=2 (if we take integer, the largest integer <=2.958 is 2).\n\nSo the integer t must satisfy: \n   t_min = ceil( (-h)/s )   [if (-h)/s is not integer, then we take the next integer]\n   t_max = floor( (-tau)/s ) [if (-tau)/s is not integer, then we take the floor]\n\nBut note: if the car does not cover 0 at all? then no time.\n\nHowever, in our case, we are only concerned with nonnegative t.\n\nSo for each car, we can compute the time interval [t_min, t_max] (if any) during which the car covers 0.\n\nBut note: if the car is already covering 0 at t=0? Then we must avoid that row at t=0.\n\nNow, for each row k, we can compute the set of times t for which the row is unsafe: if any car on row k covers 0 at time t.\n\nSince multiple cars on a row, we take the union of the intervals for each car.\n\nBut note: the intervals might be non-overlapping? We can compute the union of intervals for a row.\n\nHowever, we don't need the entire set of unsafe times for each row, but we can check at a given time t and row k: is there any car on row k that covers 0 at time t?\n\nAlternatively, we can precompute for each row k the set of unsafe times (as a set of integers) or as a list of intervals. Then during BFS we can check.\n\nBut note: the times we care about are bounded. Since we are going from 0 to 9, the minimal H is 9. And we might have to wait, but we can set an upper bound for H. Since the cars are moving and will eventually pass, we can set a maximum H, say 100? \n\nBut let's see the cars: the cars have high speeds and are starting at negative positions. The most delayed car? For example, freeway 2: (-48,-83,right,36). \n   t_min = ceil(48/36)=ceil(1.333)=2\n   t_max = floor(83/36)=floor(2.305)=2 -> so only unsafe at t=2.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 5: three cars. \n   First car: (48,37,right,6): \n        t_min = ceil(-48/6)=ceil(-8)= -8 -> but t>=0, so we start at 0? \n        Actually: condition: 37+6t <=0<=48+6t -> \n            37+6t<=0 -> 6t<=-37 -> t<=-37/6 (negative) -> no solution? \n        So this car never covers 0? \n\n   Second car: (12,1,right,6): \n        Condition: 1+6t<=0<=12+6t -> \n            1+6t<=0 -> 6t<=-1 -> t<=-1/6 -> no solution? \n        So never covers 0.\n\n   Third car: (-24,-35,right,6):\n        Condition: -35+6t<=0<=-24+6t -> \n            -35+6t<=0 -> 6t<=35 -> t<=35/6≈5.833 -> t<=5\n            -24+6t>=0 -> 6t>=24 -> t>=4\n        So t in [4,5] -> unsafe at t=4,5.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 6: same as freeway 5? \n   | 6 | (48,37,right,6), (12,1,right,6), (-24,-35,right,6) | -> same as freeway 5? unsafe at t=4,5.\n\nFreeway 7: (48,37,right,12)\n        Condition: 37+12t<=0<=48+12t -> \n            37+12t<=0 -> 12t<=-37 -> no solution? \n        So safe.\n\nFreeway 8: (48,37,right,4)\n        Condition: 37+4t<=0<=48+4t -> \n            37+4t<=0 -> 4t<=-37 -> no solution? \n        So safe.\n\nSo summary of unsafe rows:\n\nRow 1: unsafe at t=2 (from the only car)\nRow 2: unsafe at t=2 (from the car: (-48,-83,right,36) -> same as row1? \n        Actually: \n          car: (-48,-83,right,36): \n             t_min = ceil(48/36)=ceil(1.333)=2\n             t_max = floor(83/36)=2.305 -> floor=2 -> so only t=2.\nRow 3: same as row2? because the car is (-48,-83,right,36) -> same as row2: unsafe at t=2.\nRow 4: same as row2: unsafe at t=2.\nRow 5: unsafe at t=4,5 (from the third car: (-24,-35,right,6))\nRow 6: unsafe at t=4,5 (same as row5)\n\nRow 7: safe\nRow 8: safe\n\nAlso note: row0 and row9 are always safe.\n\nTherefore, we have:\n\nTime t=0: safe everywhere? but we start at row0 -> safe.\nTime t=1: rows 1-8: \n   row1: safe? because unsafe only at t=2 -> so safe at t=1.\n   row2: safe at t=1.\n   row3: safe at t=1.\n   row4: safe at t=1.\n   row5: safe (only unsafe at t=4,5)\n   row6: safe\n   row7: safe\n   row8: safe\nTime t=2: \n   row1: unsafe -> avoid row1 at t=2.\n   row2: unsafe -> avoid row2 at t=2.\n   row3: unsafe -> avoid row3 at t=2.\n   row4: unsafe -> avoid row4 at t=2.\n   row5: safe (unsafe at t=4,5) -> so row5 is safe at t=2.\n   row6: safe\n   row7: safe\n   row8: safe\nTime t=3: \n   row1: safe? because the car at row1: only unsafe at t=2 -> so safe at t=3.\n   similarly, row2,3,4: safe at t=3.\n   row5: safe\n   row6: safe\n   row7: safe\n   row8: safe\nTime t=4:\n   row1: safe\n   row2: safe\n   row3: safe\n   row4: safe\n   row5: unsafe -> avoid row5 at t=4.\n   row6: unsafe -> avoid row6 at t=4.\n   row7: safe\n   row8: safe\nTime t=5:\n   row5: unsafe\n   row6: unsafe\n   others safe.\nTime t=6: \n   row5: safe? because the car on row5 at t=5 was unsafe, but at t=6: \n        For the third car on row5: (-24,-35,right,6): \n            at t=6: \n                left = -35+6*6 = -35+36=1 -> so [1, -24+36=12] -> [1,12] -> does it cover 0? 0 is not in [1,12] -> so safe.\n        Similarly, row6: same -> safe at t=6.\n\nSo we have:\n\nUnsafe times per row:\nrow1: [2]\nrow2: [2]\nrow3: [2]\nrow4: [2]\nrow5: [4,5]\nrow6: [4,5]\n\nWe are at time0: y0=0.\n\nWe want to reach y=9.\n\nWe can only move one row per step (or stay). We can go up, down, or stay.\n\nWe are going to use BFS: state = (time, y). We start at (0,0). We want to reach (time T, 9) for minimal T.\n\nActions: U, D, S.\n\nConstraints: \n   next_y = y + delta, and must be in [0,9].\n   and the state (time+1, next_y) must be safe? Actually, note: at the current step, we are at time t and row y. Then we choose an action that moves us to row y' at the next time step (time t+1). Then at time t+1, we are at row y'. So we require that (time t+1, row y') is safe.\n\nBut note: at the current state (t,y), we are safe because we are already there? Actually, we started at (0,0) and it's safe. Then we choose an action to go to (t+1, y') and we require that (t+1, y') is safe.\n\nSo we simulate:\n\nWe start at (0,0) -> safe.\n\nThen we choose an action at time0: \n   If we choose U: then at time1, we are at y=1 -> we must check: at time1, is row1 safe? Yes (because row1 is unsafe only at time2). So safe.\n   If we choose D: then at time1, we are at y=-1 -> but y must be >=0 -> not allowed.\n   If we choose S: then at time1, we are at y=0 -> safe.\n\nSimilarly, then we proceed.\n\nWe want the minimal T (number of actions) to reach y=9.\n\nSince we must go up 9 times, and we can also go down, but we are bounded, we can use BFS until we reach y=9.\n\nWe note that the unsafe conditions are only at specific times. We'll build a graph and use BFS.\n\nWe'll keep a visited set to avoid states that we've been to at the same or earlier time? But note: if we are at (time, y) and we've been there at an earlier time, then we can skip. Because we want minimal time. However, sometimes going down and then up might be necessary? But in this case, because the unsafe conditions are fixed in time and we can wait, we might have a cycle? But we can avoid states that we've been to at the same y with the same time? Actually, we are doing BFS by time: we expand by increasing time.\n\nWe can do:\n\n   Let queue = deque([(0,0)])   # (time, y)\n   Let parent[time][y] = (prev_time, prev_y, action) for backtracking.\n\n   We start at time0, y0=0.\n\n   Then for each state (t, y), we try actions: U, D, S (if they lead to y' in [0,9]).\n        Then the next state is (t+1, y') and we check if (t+1, y') is safe: \n            if y' is 0 or 9: safe.\n            if y' in [1,8]: check if time t+1 is in the unsafe set for row y'. \n\n        If safe, then we mark and enqueue.\n\n   We stop when we reach y=9 (at any time).\n\nBut note: we want the minimal time.\n\nWe can break when we first reach y=9.\n\nWe must avoid re-visiting a state (t, y) if we have already reached it with a lower time? But we are doing BFS by time (each step increases time by 1) so the first time we reach (t, y) is the minimal time.\n\nBut note: we might have multiple ways to the same state at the same time? Then we can mark visited at (t,y).\n\nWe'll use a visited matrix: visited[t][y] = True, but t can be large? We don't know the bound. Alternatively, we can use a set: visited.add((t,y)).\n\nBut we are going to set an upper bound for time? Let's set max_time = 100? Since minimal steps is 9, and worst-case we might have to wait a few steps.\n\nNow, we simulate:\n\nUnsafe for row1: t=2 -> so at time1, row1 is safe? as we computed.\n\nWe'll build a list for each row (1 to 8) of the unsafe times:\n\nrow1: {2}\nrow2: {2}\nrow3: {2}\nrow4: {2}\nrow5: {4,5}\nrow6: {4,5}\nrow7: {}\nrow8: {}\n\nWe start:\n\n   t=0: at y=0.\n\n   Actions at t=0:\n      U: y1 = 1 -> time1: check row1 at time1: 1 not in {2} -> safe. So state (1,1)\n      D: y1 = -1 -> invalid.\n      S: y1=0 -> safe. So state (1,0)\n\n   Then t=1: we have states: (1,1) and (1,0)\n\n   From (1,1):\n        U: y2=2 -> time2: row2 at time2: unsafe? time2 in row2's unsafe set? row2: unsafe at {2} -> unsafe! -> skip.\n        D: y2=0 -> time2: row0 -> safe -> state (2,0)\n        S: y2=1 -> time2: row1: unsafe -> skip.\n\n   From (1,0):\n        U: y2=1 -> time2: row1: unsafe -> skip.\n        D: invalid.\n        S: y2=0 -> safe -> state (2,0)   [but we already have (2,0) from above?]\n\n   So at t=2, we have state (2,0).\n\n   Now from (2,0):\n        U: y3=1 -> time3: row1: unsafe set {2} -> time3=3 not in -> safe -> state(3,1)\n        D: invalid.\n        S: y3=0 -> safe -> state(3,0)\n\n   Then t=3: states (3,1) and (3,0)\n\n   From (3,1):\n        U: y4=2 -> time4: row2: unsafe set {2} -> 4 not in -> safe -> state(4,2)\n        D: y4=0 -> safe -> state(4,0)\n        S: y4=1 -> safe -> state(4,1)\n\n   From (3,0):\n        U: y4=1 -> safe -> state(4,1) [duplicate? we can mark by (t,y) so we don't duplicate at same time?]\n        D: invalid.\n        S: state(4,0) [duplicate]\n\n   So at t=4, we have: (4,2), (4,0), (4,1)\n\n   Now, at time4, row5 and row6 are unsafe -> so we cannot be at row5 or row6 at time4.\n\n   From (4,2):\n        U: y5=3 -> time5: row3: unsafe set {2} -> 5 not in -> safe -> state(5,3)\n        D: y5=1 -> safe -> state(5,1)\n        S: y5=2 -> safe -> state(5,2)\n\n   From (4,0):\n        U: y5=1 -> safe -> state(5,1) [duplicate? but same state at same time? we can avoid duplicate states at the same time by not storing duplicates? Actually, we are storing (t,y) so we can have multiple ways to the same state at the same time? Then we can skip if we have visited (t,y).]\n\n   We'll use a visited set per state (t,y). So if we get to (5,1) from two different paths, we only need one.\n\n   From (4,1):\n        U: y5=2 -> safe -> state(5,2) [duplicate? but we already have (5,2) from (4,2) by S?]\n        D: y5=0 -> state(5,0)\n        S: state(5,1)\n\n   So at t=5: states: (5,3), (5,1), (5,2), (5,0)\n\n   But note: at time5, row5 and row6 are unsafe! So if we try to go to row5 or row6 at time5, it's unsafe.\n\n   From (5,3):\n        U: y6=4 -> safe? row4: unsafe set {2} -> safe -> state(6,4)\n        D: y6=2 -> safe -> state(6,2)\n        S: y6=3 -> safe -> state(6,3)\n\n   From (5,2):\n        U: y6=3 -> safe -> state(6,3) [duplicate]\n        D: y6=1 -> safe -> state(6,1)\n        S: state(6,2) [duplicate]\n\n   From (5,1):\n        U: y6=2 -> safe -> state(6,2) [duplicate]\n        D: y6=0 -> state(6,0)\n        S: state(6,1) [duplicate]\n\n   From (5,0):\n        U: state(6,1) [duplicate]\n        D: invalid\n        S: state(6,0)\n\n   So at t=6: states: (6,4), (6,2), (6,3), (6,1), (6,0)\n\n   Now, at time6: unsafe rows: none (since row5 and row6 are safe at time6).\n\n   We can now move freely? \n\n   We need to get to row9.\n\n   From (6,4):\n        U: y7=5 -> safe (row5: unsafe at {4,5} -> 6 not in) -> state(7,5)\n        D: y7=3 -> state(7,3)\n        S: state(7,4)\n\n   Similarly, we can continue.\n\n   We want to get to y=9 as quickly as possible.\n\n   From (6,4): we can go up 5 times: 4->5->6->7->8->9: that takes 5 steps? so at time11? \n\n   But we can also go faster? We are at time6 at row4. We can go up every step: \n        time7: row5 -> safe (row5 safe at time7) -> y=5\n        time8: row6 -> safe -> y=6\n        time9: row7 -> safe -> y=7\n        time10: row8 -> safe -> y=8\n        time11: row9 -> goal.\n\n   But we might be able to go faster from other states? \n\n   However, we are at time6 at row4. The minimal steps from row4 to row9 is 5 (because 4+5=9). So that would be time11.\n\n   But we have other states at time6: row2, row3, row1, row0. \n\n   For example, from (6,0): \n        We have to go up 9 steps: 0->1->...->9: that would be 9 steps -> time15.\n\n   From (6,1): 8 steps -> time14.\n\n   From (6,2): 7 steps -> time13.\n\n   From (6,3): 6 steps -> time12.\n\n   From (6,4): 5 steps -> time11.\n\n   So the minimal time so far is 11.\n\n   But is there a path that gets to row9 earlier? \n\n   We were at time5 at row3: then we went to row4 at time6. Then from row4 we need 5 steps.\n\n   Alternatively, at time5: could we have gone higher? \n\n   At time5, we had states: (5,3), (5,1), (5,2), (5,0). The highest row was 3.\n\n   Then at time6, we got to row4 (from row3) and row3,2,1,0.\n\n   So the highest row at time6 is 4.\n\n   Then we go to row5 at time7, row6 at time8, row7 at time9, row8 at time10, row9 at time11.\n\n   But wait: can we skip some rows? \n\n   However, we can only move one row per step.\n\n   Therefore, the minimal time from start to row9 is at least 9 steps (if we go up every step) but we had to detour? Actually, we started at row0 and then went to row1 at time1, then had to go back to row0 at time2? then to row1 at time3, then row2 at time4, then row3 at time5, row4 at time6, and then row5 at time7, etc. So we had to wait at time2? \n\n   Alternatively, is there a path that avoids waiting? \n\n   We started at row0 at time0. Then we went to row1 at time1. Then at time2, we cannot stay at row1 (unsafe) and we cannot go to row2 (unsafe) so we had to go down to row0. Then at time3, we went to row1. Then at time4, we went to row2. Then at time5, we went to row3. Then at time6, we went to row4. Then at time7, row5 (safe because row5 unsafe only at time4,5) -> safe. Then time8: row6 (safe at time8) -> safe. Then time9: row7, time10: row8, time11: row9.\n\n   So the sequence of actions:\n\n   t0: U -> to row1\n   t1: D? but wait: we went from row1 (at time1) to row0 at time2: so action at t1: D? \n        Actually: at time1 we were at row1 -> then we took action D at time1: to go to row0 at time2.\n\n   Then at time2 we were at row0 -> then at time2 we took action U to go to row1 at time3? \n        But wait: at time2, from row0, we took U -> then at time3 we are at row1.\n\n   Then at time3: we are at row1 -> we took U to go to row2 at time4? \n        But wait: at time3, row1: safe -> then we can take U to row2 at time4? and time4: row2 is safe? because row2 unsafe only at time2 -> so safe at time4.\n\n        However, at time4, we have a state (4,2). Then at time4, we can take U to go to row3 at time5? \n        Then at time5: row3 is safe? row3 unsafe only at time2 -> safe.\n\n        Then at time5: we are at row3 -> then we take U to row4 at time6.\n\n        Then at time6: row4: safe? row4 unsafe only at time2 -> safe.\n\n        Then at time6: row4 -> then we can go up: \n          time6: U -> row5 at time7: safe (row5 unsafe at 4,5 -> 7 safe)\n          time7: U -> row6 at time8: safe (row6 unsafe at 4,5 -> 8 safe)\n          time8: U -> row7 at time9: safe\n          time9: U -> row8 at time10: safe\n          time10: U -> row9 at time11: goal.\n\n   So the sequence of actions:\n\n      t0: U  (from row0 to row1 at time1)\n      t1: D  (from row1 to row0 at time2)  -> but wait, is that the only option? \n          Alternatively, we could have taken S at time0 to stay at row0 at time1, then at time1: \n              we can take U to row1 at time2 -> but row1 is unsafe at time2 -> collision.\n\n          So we had to go up at time0 and then down at time1? \n\n      Then:\n          t0: U\n          t1: D -> so we are at row0 at time2? \n          Then at time2: we are at row0 -> then we take U to row1 at time3? \n          Then at time3: U to row2 at time4? \n          Then at time4: U to row3 at time5?\n          Then at time5: U to row4 at time6?\n          Then at time6: U to row5 at time7?\n          Then at time7: U to row6 at time8?\n          Then at time8: U to row7 at time9?\n          Then at time9: U to row8 at time10?\n          Then at time10: U to row9 at time11.\n\n      That's 11 actions: H=11.\n\n      The actions: \n          t0: U\n          t1: D\n          t2: U\n          t3: U\n          t4: U\n          t5: U\n          t6: U\n          t7: U\n          t8: U\n          t9: U\n          t10: U\n\n      But wait: from row0 at time2, we go U to row1 at time3. Then from row1 at time3, we go U to row2 at time4. Then row2 at time4: safe -> yes. Then row3 at time5: safe. Then row4 at time6: safe. Then row5 at time7: safe.\n\n      But note: at time4, we are at row2 -> safe? yes. \n      At time5, we are at row3 -> safe? yes.\n\n      However, we can skip one of the moves? \n\n      Alternatively, we had another path: at time1 we were at row0? by taking S at time0? \n\n          t0: S -> stay at row0 at time1? \n          Then at time1: we can take U to row1 at time2 -> but row1 at time2: unsafe -> collision. So that path is invalid.\n\n      So the only option at time1 was to go down to row0? But we were already at row0? \n\n      Actually: at time0: we started at row0 -> then at time0 we took U to row1 at time1. Then at time1, we were at row1 -> then we took D to row0 at time2.\n\n      Then at time2: we are at row0 -> then we take U to row1 at time3.\n\n      But then we have to go up from row1 at time3 to row2 at time4.\n\n      Then we continue.\n\n      So the sequence is fixed? \n\n      However, we had at time3: we were at row1 -> we could have taken U to row2 at time4? and that's safe.\n\n      So the actions are:\n\n          t0: U\n          t1: D\n          t2: U\n          t3: U\n          t4: U   -> to row3 at time5? \n          t5: U   -> to row4 at time6\n          t6: U   -> to row5 at time7\n          t7: U   -> to row6 at time8\n          t8: U   -> to row7 at time9\n          t9: U   -> to row8 at time10\n          t10: U  -> to row9 at time11\n\n      But wait: from row0 at time2, we take U to row1 at time3 -> that's one step. Then from row1 at time3, we take U to row2 at time4 -> then row2 at time4: safe. Then from row2 at time4, we take U to row3 at time5 -> safe. Then row3 at time5 to row4 at time6 -> safe. Then row4 at time6 to row5 at time7 -> safe. Then row5 at time7 to row6 at time8 -> safe. Then row6 at time8 to row7 at time9 -> safe. Then row7 at time9 to row8 at time10 -> safe. Then row8 at time10 to row9 at time11.\n\n      That's 11 actions.\n\n      But we started at time0 and we have 11 actions (from t0 to t10) so H=11.\n\n      Is there a faster way? \n\n      Consider: can we avoid going down? \n\n      At time0: we go to row1 at time1 -> safe.\n      Then at time1: we cannot stay at row1 (because at time2 row1 is unsafe) and we cannot go to row2 (because at time2 row2 is unsafe). So we must leave row1 and row2 at time2? The only safe row at time2 is row0 and rows>=5? But row5 is unsafe at time2? no, row5 is unsafe at time4 and 5. So row5 is safe at time2? \n\n      How do we get to row5 at time2? \n\n      We are at row1 at time1. Then we can only move one step. So we can go to row0, row1 (stay) or row2. But row1 and row2 are unsafe at time2. So the only safe option is row0.\n\n      Therefore, we must go down to row0 at time2.\n\n      Then from row0 at time2: we can go to row1 at time3? Then row1 is safe at time3. Then we can go to row2 at time4? safe. Then row3 at time5? safe. Then row4 at time6? safe. Then row5 at time7? safe.\n\n      Alternatively, from row0 at time2: can we go to row0 (stay) at time3? Then at time3: row0 is safe. Then at time3 we can go to row1 at time4? safe. Then row2 at time5? safe. Then row3 at time6? safe. Then row4 at time7? safe. Then row5 at time8? safe. That would be slower.\n\n      So the minimal is 11.\n\n      But wait: we had another state at time4: we could be at row2 at time4? and then we can go up to row3 at time5, then row4 at time6, then row5 at time7, etc. -> that's the same.\n\n      Therefore, the minimal H is 11.\n\n      The actions:\n\n          Turn 0: U\n          Turn 1: D\n          Turn 2: U\n          Turn 3: U\n          Turn 4: U\n          Turn 5: U\n          Turn 6: U\n          Turn 7: U\n          Turn 8: U\n          Turn 9: U\n          Turn 10: U\n\n      But wait: after 11 actions, we are at turn 0 to turn 10 (11 actions) and then at time11 we are at row9.\n\n      However, the problem says: a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} -> so we have H actions, and we start at t1=0, so the actions are for t=0,1,...,10 -> H=11.\n\n      And we are at y_{11} = 9.\n\n      Now, we must verify the entire path:\n\n        t0: start at (0,0) -> action U -> to (0,1) at time1.\n        t1: at (0,1) -> action D -> to (0,0) at time2.\n        t2: at (0,0) -> action U -> to (0,1) at time3.\n        t3: at (0,1) -> action U -> to (0,2) at time4.\n        t4: at (0,2) -> action U -> to (0,3) at time5.\n        t5: at (0,3) -> action U -> to (0,4) at time6.\n        t6: at (0,4) -> action U -> to (0,5) at time7.\n        t7: at (0,5) -> action U -> to (0,6) at time8.\n        t8: at (0,6) -> action U -> to (0,7) at time9.\n        t9: at (0,7) -> action U -> to (0,8) at time10.\n        t10: at (0,8) -> action U -> to (0,9) at time11.\n\n      Check collisions:\n\n        Time0: row0 -> safe (no cars)\n        Time1: row1 -> safe (because row1 unsafe only at time2)\n        Time2: row0 -> safe\n        Time3: row1 -> safe (time3 not in {2})\n        Time4: row2 -> safe (time4 not in {2}) -> but row2 unsafe only at time2 -> safe.\n        Time5: row3 -> safe (row3 unsafe only at time2) -> safe.\n        Time6: row4 -> safe (row4 unsafe only at time2) -> safe.\n        Time7: row5 -> safe? row5 unsafe at time4,5 -> time7 safe.\n        Time8: row6 -> safe? row6 unsafe at time4,5 -> safe.\n        Time9: row7 -> safe (no car at row7 at time9? row7 is always safe) -> safe.\n        Time10: row8 -> safe (always safe) -> safe.\n\n      So no collisions.\n\n      Therefore, the minimal H is 11.\n\n      The answer:\n\n      Turn 0: U\n      Turn 1: D\n      Turn 2: U\n      Turn 3: U\n      Turn 4: U\n      Turn 5: U\n      Turn 6: U\n      Turn 7: U\n      Turn 8: U\n      Turn 9: U\n      Turn 10: U\n\nBut wait, we have 11 actions? and the last action is at turn10, which leads to row9 at time11.\n\nThe problem says: the sequence of actions is for turns t1 to t1+H-1, and we start at t1=0, so turns 0 to 10, which is 11 turns.\n\nBut the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\" and then the sequence has H actions? \n\nYes, because we take one action per turn. And we start at turn0, and after H actions we are at the goal. So H=11.\n\nTherefore, we output:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 0: U\nTurn 1: D\nTurn 2: U\nTurn 3: U\nTurn 4: U\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\n}\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" and t1=0.\n\nSo we write:\n\nTurn 0: U\nTurn 1: D\nTurn 2: U\nTurn 3: U\nTurn 4: U\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\n\nHowever, we must check if there is a path with H<11? \n\nWhat if we go faster? \n\nAt time0: U -> row1 at time1.\nAt time1: we cannot go to row2 at time2 (unsafe) and row1 at time2 is unsafe. So we must go to row0 at time2.\n\nThen at time2: we are at row0. Then we go U to row1 at time3.\nThen we go U to row2 at time4 (safe? because row2 unsafe only at time2 -> safe at time4).\nThen we go U to row3 at time5 (safe).\nThen we go U to row4 at time6 (safe).\nThen we go U to row5 at time7 (safe).\nThen we go U to row6 at time8 (safe).\nThen we go U to row7 at time9, row8 at time10, row9 at time11.\n\nSame as above.\n\nAlternatively, at time3: we are at row1. Instead of going up to row2 at time4, could we go up twice? We can only move one per turn.\n\nAnother idea: at time0: S (stay at row0) at time1 -> then at time1: we are at row0 -> then we can go U to row1 at time2 -> but row1 is unsafe at time2 -> collision. So that fails.\n\nAt time0: D? invalid.\n\nSo no alternative.\n\nTherefore, the above sequence is minimal.\n\nBut note: we could have gone to row3 at time4? from row2 at time4? Then we could save one step? \n\nBut we are at row0 at time2 -> then at time3 we are at row1 -> then at time4 we are at row2 -> then at time5 we are at row3 -> same as above.\n\nAlternatively, at time3: from row1, we go up to row2 at time4 -> then at time4 we are at row2 -> then at time5 we go to row3 -> same.\n\nSo we cannot skip.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid row5 and row6 at time4 and time5? but we are not going to row5 until time7, so that's safe.\n\nTherefore, we have the answer.\n\nBut let me check if we can avoid the down move? \n\nWhat if we go to row3 at time2? \n\nWe start at time0: row0 -> at time0 we take U: to row1 at time1.\nAt time1: we take U: to row2 at time2 -> but row2 is unsafe at time2 -> collision.\n\nAt time1: we take UU? no, we can only take one action per turn.\n\nSo we cannot jump to row3 at time2.\n\nSimilarly, we cannot use row4 at time2? because we can only be at row2 at time2 at best? and that's unsafe.\n\nSo the down move is necessary.\n\nThus, the answer is as above.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach the position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) is 11.

Collision happens only if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y, and for that freeway, there is a car such that 0 is in its span at that turn. The span changes over time based on direction and speed.\n\nImportant note: when I move to a new y at turn T, I'm not on that new y until turn T+1. So at turn T, I'm on y_T, and if I move, at turn T+1 I'm on y_{T+1}. Collision is checked based on where I am at each turn.\n\nSpecifically: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nBut since I'm moving at turn T, at turn T I'm still on y_T, so I only care about cars on y_T at turn T. When I arrive at y_{T+1} at turn T+1, I need to check cars on y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nThe collision condition is per turn: at turn T, I'm on y_T, and I collide if for freeway y_T, there is a car with 0 in its span at time T.\n\nNow, the car spans are given at time t_1 = 1. I need to compute where they are at future times.\n\nLet me list all the cars at t=1.\n\nFreeway 1: one car, head -24, tail -47, direction right, speed 24.\n\nSince it's right-moving, span at time T: [τ + s(T - t1), h + s(T - t1)] = [-47 + 24(T-1), -24 + 24(T-1)]\n\nDirection right: span at T is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nGiven head h, tail τ. For right-moving, head is larger, so at t1, span is [τ, h], then at T, it's [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nSimilarly, left-moving: if direction left, head is smaller, span at t1 is [h, τ], then at T, [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nIn this case, all cars seem to be right-moving except I need to check.\n\nFreeway 1: (-24, -47, right, 24)\n\nSince direction right, head is -24, tail is -47? Head should be the front, so for right-moving, head is larger number, but here h=-24, τ=-47, -24 > -47, so head is -24, tail is -47, so at t1, span is [τ, h] = [-47, -24]\n\nThen at time T, span is [ -47 + 24(T-1), -24 + 24(T-1) ]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFreeway 2: (-12, -47, right, 36)\n\nh=-12, τ=-47, so at t1, span [-47, -12]\n\nAt T: [ -47 + 36(T-1), -12 + 36(T-1) ]\n\nFreeway 3: same as 2? (-12, -47, right, 36) identical to freeway 2? Probably different freeway, but same car state? No, freeway 3 has same car.\n\nFreeway 4: also (-12, -47, right, 36) same as 2 and 3? That seems odd, but possible.\n\nFreeway 5: has three cars: (54,43,right,6), (18,7,right,6), (-18,-29,right,6)\n\nAll right-moving, speed 6.\n\nFor each car, at t1:\n\nFirst car: h=54, τ=43, span at t1: [43,54]? Since right-moving, [τ,h] = [43,54]\n\nAt T: [43 + 6(T-1), 54 + 6(T-1)]\n\nSecond car: (18,7,right,6), span at t1: [7,18], at T: [7 + 6(T-1), 18 + 6(T-1)]\n\nThird car: (-18,-29,right,6), span at t1: [-29,-18], at T: [-29 + 6(T-1), -18 + 6(T-1)]\n\nFreeway 6: same as freeway 5? (54,43,right,6), (18,7,right,6), (-18,-29,right,6) identical to freeway 5.\n\nFreeway 7: (60,49,right,12), so h=60, τ=49? head 60, tail 49, so at t1 span [49,60], at T: [49 + 12(T-1), 60 + 12(T-1)]\n\nFreeway 8: (52,41,right,4), h=52, τ=41, span at t1 [41,52], at T: [41 + 4(T-1), 52 + 4(T-1)]\n\nNow, I start at y=1 at turn t=1.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nSince y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, I think no cars there, so safe. But I start at (0,1), which is on freeway 1? Position (0,y), so at (0,y), y is the freeway row.\n\nFreeways are from y=1 to y=8, so y=0 and y=9 should be safe, no cars.\n\nI need to be at (0,9), which is not a freeway, so no collision possible there.\n\nBut to reach there, I need to be on y=9 at some turn.\n\nNow, actions: each turn I can change y by -1,0,+1.\n\nFrom y=1 to y=9, the minimum moves would be 8 up actions, but I have to avoid cars on the way, and also I might need to wait or something.\n\nSince I can only change by 1 each turn, the minimal H without obstacles would be 8 turns to go from y=1 to y=9 with U each time.\n\nBut with cars, I might need to delay or go down sometimes, but going down might not help since I need to go up.\n\nI should compute for each freeway, when 0 is occupied, i.e., when a car spans 0.\n\nBecause collision happens if at turn T, I am on freeway k, and 0 is in some car's span on that freeway at time T.\n\nSo for each freeway k, I need to find the times T where 0 is not covered by any car, i.e., for all cars on k, 0 not in span at T.\n\nThen, when I am on k at T, it must be safe.\n\nSince I start at t=1 on y=1, I need to check for each freeway at each time if it's safe.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway, the times when 0 is occupied.\n\nSince the cars move continuously, but we have discrete turns, and spans are intervals.\n\n0 is occupied on freeway k at time T if there exists a car on k such that the span at T contains 0.\n\nThat is, for some car, min_span <= 0 <= max_span.\n\nSince the spans are intervals, we can find when 0 is covered.\n\nFor freeway 1: only one car, span at T: [ -47 + 24(T-1), -24 + 24(T-1) ]\n\nSet low = -47 + 24(T-1), high = -24 + 24(T-1)\n\n0 in [low, high] if low <= 0 <= high.\n\nSo -47 + 24(T-1) <= 0 and 0 <= -24 + 24(T-1)\n\nFirst inequality: -47 + 24(T-1) <= 0 => 24(T-1) <= 47 => T-1 <= 47/24 = 1.9583, so T <= 2.9583, since T integer, T <= 2\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= -24 + 24(T-1) => 24 <= 24(T-1) => 1 <= T-1 => T >= 2\n\nSo T >=2 and T <=2, so T=2.\n\nFor T=2, low = -47 +24(1) = -47+24= -23, high= -24+24=0\n\nSo [ -23, 0 ], so 0 is included? high=0, so 0 <=0 is true, so yes, 0 in [-23,0]\n\nFor T=1: low = -47 +24(0) = -47, high=-24+0=-24, so [-47,-24], 0 not in, since -24 <0.\n\nT=3: low=-47+24(2)= -47+48=1, high=-24+48=24, [1,24], 0 not in.\n\nSo only at T=2, 0 is occupied on freeway 1.\n\nFor other T, freeway 1 is safe at 0.\n\nNow freeway 2: one car, h=-12, τ=-47, right, s=36\n\nSpan at T: [ -47 + 36(T-1), -12 + 36(T-1) ]\n\n0 in span if low <=0 <= high\n\n-47 +36(T-1) <=0 and 0 <= -12 +36(T-1)\n\nFirst: -47 +36(T-1) <=0 => 36(T-1) <=47 => T-1 <=47/36≈1.3055, T<=2.3055, T<=2\n\nSecond: 0 <= -12 +36(T-1) => 12 <=36(T-1) => 1/3 <= T-1 => T-1 >= 1/3, since T integer, T >= 2? T-1 >= 0.333, so for T>=2, since T=1: T-1=0<0.333\n\nT=1: T-1=0, -12 +0 = -12 <0, so 0 <= -12 false.\n\nT=2: -12 +36(1) = 24, 0 <=24 true.\n\nT=1: low= -47 +0 = -47, high= -12, both negative, 0 not <= high.\n\nSo for T=2: low= -47 +36(1) = -47+36= -11, high= -12+36=24\n\n[ -11, 24], 0 in it.\n\nT=1: [ -47, -12], no\n\nT=3: low= -47 +36(2)= -47+72=25, high= -12+72=60, [25,60], no 0.\n\nSo only T=2 occupied for freeway 2.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as freeway 2, (-12,-47,right,36), so same, only T=2 occupied.\n\nFreeway 4: also same, only T=2.\n\nNow freeway 5: has three cars.\n\nFirst car: (54,43,right,6), span at T: [43 +6(T-1), 54 +6(T-1)]\n\n0 in it? min=43+6(T-1) >=43>0 for T>=1, so always >0, never <=0? min is at least 43>0, so 0 not in span for any T. Similarly, max at least 43>0, so this car never covers 0.\n\nSecond car: (18,7,right,6), span at T: [7+6(T-1), 18+6(T-1)]\n\nmin=7+6(T-1), for T=1, min=7, max=18, both >0.\n\nT=2: min=7+6=13, max=18+6=24>0\n\nAlways min >=7>0, so never covers 0.\n\nThird car: (-18,-29,right,6), span at T: [-29 +6(T-1), -18 +6(T-1)]\n\nSet low = -29 +6(T-1), high= -18 +6(T-1)\n\n0 in [low, high] if low <=0 <= high\n\nlow <=0: -29 +6(T-1) <=0 => 6(T-1) <=29 => T-1 <=29/6≈4.833, T<=5.833, T<=5\n\nhigh >=0: -18 +6(T-1) >=0 => 6(T-1) >=18 => T-1 >=3, T>=4\n\nSo T>=4 and T<=5.\n\nT=4: low= -29 +6(3) = -29+18= -11, high= -18+18=0, so [ -11, 0], 0 included.\n\nT=5: low= -29 +6(4)= -29+24= -5, high= -18+24=6, [ -5,6], 0 in.\n\nT=3: low= -29+6(2)= -29+12= -17, high= -18+12= -6, both negative, 0 not <= high? high=-6<0, so 0 not in.\n\nT=6: low= -29+30=1, high= -18+30=12>0, min>0, not.\n\nSo for freeway 5, only the third car can cover 0, at T=4 and T=5.\n\nFirst two cars never cover 0, so freeway 5 is occupied at T=4 and T=5.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6 is identical to freeway 5, so same, occupied at T=4 and T=5.\n\nNow freeway 7: (60,49,right,12), span at T: [49 +12(T-1), 60 +12(T-1)]\n\nmin=49+12(T-1) >=49>0 for all T>=1, so never covers 0. Freeway 7 always safe at 0.\n\nmin=49 at T=1, increases, always >0.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8: (52,41,right,4), span at T: [41 +4(T-1), 52 +4(T-1)]\n\nmin=41+4(T-1) >=41>0 for all T, so always >0, never covers 0. So freeway 8 always safe.\n\nSummary of when each freeway is occupied (unsafe) at position 0:\n\n- Freeway 1: only at T=2\n\n- Freeway 2: only at T=2\n\n- Freeway 3: only at T=2\n\n- Freeway 4: only at T=2\n\n- Freeway 5: at T=4 and T=5\n\n- Freeway 6: at T=4 and T=5\n\n- Freeway 7: never\n\n- Freeway 8: never\n\ny=7 and y=8 are always safe.\n\ny=1 to 4 are only unsafe at T=2, and safe otherwise.\n\ny=1: unsafe at T=2, safe else.\n\ny=2: unsafe at T=2, safe else.\n\nSimilarly y=3 and y=4.\n\ny=5 and y=6 unsafe at T=4 and T=5, safe else.\n\ny=7 and y=8 always safe.\n\nI start at turn t=1, position y=1.\n\nAt turn T=1, I am on y=1.\n\nIs it safe? At T=1, freeway 1: we said not occupied, since only T=2.\n\nAt T=1, for freeway 1: span [-47,-24], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways at T=1 are safe except possibly, but y=1 at T=1 is safe.\n\nNow, I need to reach y=9.\n\ny=9 is not a freeway, so to be at (0,9), I need to be on y=9 at some turn.\n\nSince y=9 has no cars, it's always safe, but I need to move there.\n\nThe position is (0,y), and freeways are for y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, so no cars, so when I am at y=0 or y=9, no collision possible.\n\nBut to reach y=9, I need to go through the freeways.\n\nNow, actions: each turn I can go up, down, or stay.\n\nI start at y=1 at t=1.\n\nI need to get to y=9 as fast as possible.\n\nMinimal without obstacles: 8 up moves, from t=1 to t=8, y from 1 to 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9.\n\nBut I have to avoid being on unsafe freeways at unsafe times.\n\nFor example, if I go up each turn:\n\nAt t=1: y=1, safe (as above)\n\nAction: I can choose action at each turn.\n\nTurn t: I am at position (0, y_t), I choose action a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, with Δy based on a_t.\n\nThen at turn t+1, I am at (0, y_{t+1}), and so on.\n\nCollision is checked at each turn based on current y_t.\n\nSo for the sequence.\n\nStart at t=1, y=1.\n\nIf I do U at t=1, then y2 = y1 +1 = 2\n\nThen at t=2, I am at y=2.\n\nBut at t=2, y=2 is unsafe! Because freeway 2 is occupied at T=2.\n\nSimilarly, if I stay at t=1, S, then y2 = y1 =1, at t=2 I am still at y=1, which is unsafe at T=2.\n\nIf I go down, D, y2=1-1=0, at t=2 I am at y=0, which is not a freeway, so safe, no cars.\n\ny=0 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=9 safe.\n\nSo at t=1, if I do D, I go to y=0 at t=2.\n\nThen from there, I can go up.\n\nBut going down might take extra turns.\n\nI need min H.\n\nH is the number of turns, from t to t+H-1, so actions from t=1 to t=H-1, and after H actions, I am at y=9 at turn t=1 + (H-1) = H? Let's see.\n\nTurn index: start at turn t=1, after 0 actions, y=1.\n\nAfter first action at t=1, I go to y at t=2.\n\nGenerally, after k actions, I am at turn t=1+k.\n\nI reach y=9 at some turn T, and H is such that T = t1 + H - 1 = 1 + H - 1 = H.\n\nt1 + H - 1, since actions from t=0 to H-1 relative, but here t1=1.\n\nSequence {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, so actions at times t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\nThen after action at t1+H-1, position at turn (t1+H-1) + 1? No.\n\nAt turn T, before action, position is (0, y_T), then I choose action a_T, which determines y_{T+1}.\n\nThen at turn T+1, I am at (0, y_{T+1}).\n\nSo when I am at turn T, I am at y_T, and I perform action a_T to go to y_{T+1}.\n\nI need to be at y=9 at some turn, say at turn T, for T >=1.\n\nBut at turn T, if I am at y=9, since not freeway, no collision, so it's fine.\n\ny=9 is reached at some turn.\n\nThe position after actions: at turn t1, I start with y_{t1} =1.\n\nAfter action a_{t1} at turn t1, I go to y_{t1+1}.\n\nI need y_{t1 + H} =9? Let's see the indices.\n\nTurn: t=1, position y1=1\n\nChoose a1, then y2 = y1 + Δy1\n\nAt turn t=2, position y2, choose a2, y3 = y2 + Δy2, and so on.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t.\n\nI need for some t, y_t =9.\n\nAnd H is the number of actions, so from t=1 to t=H, after H actions, I am at turn t=1+H, position y_{1+H}.\n\nt1 + H -1 is the last action turn? Let's see the answer format.\n\n\"sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1\"\n\nt1=1, so actions a1, a2, ..., a_{1 + H -1} = a_H\n\nFor t from 0 to H-1, a_{t1 + t} = a_{1 + t}, so actions at t=1,2,3,...,H.\n\nThen after these actions, the position at turn (1 + H) should be (0,9)? At turn T, after action a_T, position at T+1.\n\nAfter action at turn T, position at turn T+1 is set.\n\nSo after last action at turn t=H (since actions from t=1 to t=H), position at turn H+1 should be 9.\n\nAnd collision is checked at each turn from t=1 to t=H, but not at t=H+1 if we are at y=9.\n\nSince y=9 has no cars, no collision.\n\nBut during the path, for turns t=1 to t=H, when at y_t, it must be safe, i.e., not colliding with cars on that freeway at that turn.\n\nFor t=1 to H, y_t must be such that if y_t between 1 and 8, it is safe at time t.\n\nNow, back to the path.\n\nI start at t=1, y=1, safe.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\nThe unsafe times:\n\nFor y=1,2,3,4: unsafe only at t=2\n\nFor y=5,6: unsafe at t=4 and t=5\n\ny=7,8 always safe.\n\nTo minimize H, I want to go up as fast as possible.\n\nBut at t=2, if I am on y=1,2,3, or 4, I will collide, since all are unsafe at t=2.\n\ny=1 to 4 all unsafe at t=2.\n\nSo at t=2, I cannot be on y=1,2,3,4.\n\nWhere can I be at t=2?\n\nI can be on y=0, or y=5,6,7,8, but y=5 and 6 might be safe at t=2? Let's see.\n\nAt t=2, y=5 and y=6 are safe, since they are only unsafe at t=4 and 5.\n\ny=5 unsafe at t=4,5, so at t=2, safe.\n\nSimilarly y=6 safe at t=2.\n\ny=7,8 always safe.\n\ny=0 safe.\n\nSo at t=2, I can be on y=0, or y=5,6,7,8.\n\nBut from y=1 at t=1, how can I be on y=5 at t=2? Impossible, since I can only change by +1,0,-1 per turn.\n\nFrom y=1 at t=1, after one action, y2 can be 0,1, or 2.\n\nNot 5.\n\nSimilarly, cannot be on y=6,7,8 at t=2.\n\nSo only possibilities for y2: 0,1,2.\n\nBut y=1 and 2 are unsafe at t=2, so if I am on y=1 or 2 at t=2, I collide.\n\nTherefore, the only safe choice at t=2 is to be on y=0.\n\nSo I must go down at t=1, so that y2=0.\n\nAction at t=1: D, then y2=0.\n\nAt t=2, I am at y=0, which is safe.\n\nNow from there, I need to go up to y=9.\n\nAt t=2, y=0.\n\nI can choose action at t=2.\n\nIf I go up, U, then y3=1.\n\nBut at t=3, what is the safety?\n\nNow, for y=1, unsafe only at t=2, so at t=3, y=1 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways.\n\nLet's list the unsafe times again.\n\ny=1: unsafe t=2, safe t=1, t=3,4,5,...\n\ny=2: same, unsafe t=2 only\n\ny=3: unsafe t=2 only\n\ny=4: unsafe t=2 only\n\ny=5: unsafe t=4 and t=5\n\ny=6: unsafe t=4 and t=5\n\ny=7: always safe\n\ny=8: always safe\n\nAt t=2, I am at y=0.\n\nAt t=3, I can be at y=0,1, or -1, but y cannot be negative, y in [0,9], so y=0 or 1.\n\nIf I do S at t=2, y3=0\n\nIf U, y3=1\n\nIf D, but y=0, D would go to -1, invalid, so only S or U possible? y_{t+1} must be in [0,9], so from y=0, I can do S (y=0), U (y=1), or D? D would be y= -1, not allowed, so only S or U.\n\nSimilarly, from y=9, only D or S, not U.\n\nBut here y=0.\n\nSo at t=2, action: if S, stay at y=0 for t=3.\n\nIf U, go to y=1 at t=3.\n\nNow, at t=3, if I am at y=1, it is safe, since unsafe only t=2.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 safe.\n\nI want to go up, so better to go to y=1 at t=3.\n\nAction at t=2: U, then y3=1.\n\nAt t=3, position y=1, safe.\n\nNow from here, I need to go to y=9.\n\nI can start going up.\n\nBut I have to avoid y=5 and 6 at t=4 and t=5.\n\nAt t=3, I am at y=1.\n\nIf I go up, U, then y4=2 at t=4.\n\nt=4, y=2 is safe? y=2 unsafe only t=2, so at t=4 safe.\n\ny=2 is freeway 2, unsafe only at t=2, so at t=4 safe.\n\nSimilarly, I can continue up.\n\nBut y=5 and y=6 are unsafe at t=4 and t=5.\n\nSo if I go up directly:\n\nt=3: y=1, action U, then y4=2\n\nt=4: y=2, action U, then y5=3\n\nt=5: y=3, action U, then y6=4\n\nt=6: y=4, action U, then y7=5\n\nt=7: y=5, action U, then y8=6\n\nt=8: y=6, action U, then y9=7\n\nt=9: y=7, action U, then y10=8\n\nt=10: y=8, action U, then y11=9\n\nNow, at which turns am I on which y, and check safety.\n\nt=3: y=1, safe (not t=2)\n\nt=4: y=2, safe (t=4 not unsafe for y=2)\n\ny=2 unsafe only t=2, so t=4 safe.\n\nt=5: y=3, unsafe? y=3 unsafe only t=2, so t=5 safe.\n\nt=6: y=4, safe.\n\nt=7: y=5, now t=7, is y=5 safe? y=5 unsafe at t=4 and 5, t=7>5, so should be safe? Earlier we said y=5 unsafe only t=4,5, so at t=7, safe.\n\nSimilarly, t=8: y=6, unsafe at t=4,5, t=8 safe.\n\nt=9: y=7, always safe\n\nt=10: y=8, always safe\n\nt=11: y=9, safe.\n\nBut I reached y=9 at t=11.\n\nH is the number of actions, from t=1 to t=H, position at t=H+1=9.\n\nIn this case, actions from t=1 to t=10? Let's list the turns and actions.\n\nStart t=1: we have action at t=1 (D), to go to y2=0\n\nt=2: action U, to y3=1\n\nt=3: action U, to y4=2\n\nt=4: action U, to y5=3\n\nt=5: action U, to y6=4\n\nt=6: action U, to y7=5\n\nt=7: action U, to y8=6\n\nt=8: action U, to y9=7\n\nt=9: action U, to y10=8\n\nt=10: action U, to y11=9\n\nSo after 10 actions, at turn t=11, y=9.\n\nNumber of actions H=10.\n\nBut I started at t=1 y=1, and ended at t=11 y=9.\n\nBut is this minimal? Probably not, because I went down first.\n\nWithout going down, can I avoid the t=2 problem?\n\nAt t=1, y=1, if I don't go down, I must be on y=0,1, or 2 at t=2.\n\ny=1 and 2 unsafe at t=2, so only y=0 safe, so I must go down at t=1, no choice.\n\nSo that seems necessary.\n\nBut after that, I went directly up, but I have y=5 and 6 unsafe at t=4,5, but in the path above, at t=4 I was at y=2, which is fine, and at t=5 I was at y=3, fine, and I reached y=5 at t=7, which is after t=5, so safe.\n\nSimilarly for y=6.\n\nBut can I reach faster?\n\nFor example, from y=0 at t=2, if I go up faster.\n\nBut from y=0 to y=9, minimal 9 steps: y=0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9, but I start from y=0 at t=2, so at t=3 y=1, t=4 y=2, ..., up to t=11 y=9, same as above.\n\nt=2 y=0, t=3 y=1, t=4 y=2, t=5 y=3, t=6 y=4, t=7 y=5, t=8 y=6, t=9 y=7, t=10 y=8, t=11 y=9.\n\n10 actions from t=2 to t=11? Actions at t=2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 to reach y=9 at t=11.\n\nBut I also have action at t=1.\n\nTotal actions from t=1 to t=10, 10 actions.\n\nBut H is the number, so H=10.\n\nBut perhaps I can be smarter.\n\nNotice that y=7 and 8 are always safe, and I can go directly to them.\n\nBut from y=1 at t=1, I have to go through the lower freeways.\n\nAnother idea: at t=1, I go down to y=0 at t=2.\n\nThen at t=2, I stay or go up.\n\nBut if I stay at y=0, it delays, not helpful.\n\nSo go up at t=2 to y=1 at t=3.\n\nThen at t=3, y=1.\n\nInstead of going up step by step, I need to consider the unsafe times for y=5 and 6 at t=4 and 5.\n\nBut in the path above, at t=4 I am at y=2, not 5 or 6, so fine.\n\nAt t=4, if I could be at y=5, but from y=1 at t=3, I can only be at y=2 at t=4, not y=5.\n\nSo impossible to skip.\n\nPerhaps I can go down or stay to avoid being on y=5 or 6 at t=4 or 5.\n\nBut in the direct path, I am not on them at t=4 or 5, so no need.\n\nt=4: in path, y=2\n\nt=5: y=3\n\ny=5 at t=7, which is fine.\n\nBut t=7 is after t=5, safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, but I have to reach y=9.\n\nAnother point: since y=7 and 8 are always safe, I could go to them earlier, but I have to go through y=1 to 6 first.\n\nMinimal time: from start t=1 y=1, to y=9.\n\nThe critical point is t=2, I must be at y=0 to avoid collision.\n\nThen from t=2 y=0, to t=3 y=1, t=4 y=2, ..., each step up, until y=9 at t=11.\n\nCan I reach before t=11?\n\nFor example, if I go up twice in a row or something, but no, I can only change by 1 per turn.\n\nUnless I start from higher, but I start from y=1.\n\nPerhaps I can stay at some point to let the cars pass, but in this case, for y=5 and 6, the unsafe times are t=4 and 5, but since I am not on them at that time, no issue.\n\nIn fact, in the path, I pass y=5 at t=7, which is fine.\n\nBut let's confirm if there is a shorter path.\n\nSuppose at t=1, I go down to y=0 at t=2.\n\nThen at t=2, I go up to y=1 at t=3.\n\nNow at t=3, y=1, instead of going up, suppose I go up to y=2 at t=4.\n\nBut at t=4, I need to avoid y=5 and 6? No, y=5 and 6 are unsafe only if I am on them at t=4 or 5.\n\nBut at t=4, if I am at y=2, it is not y=5 or 6, so fine.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps I can reach y=9 faster by going directly, but I don't see how.\n\nAnother idea: after t=3 y=1, I go up to y=2 at t=4, then to y=3 at t=5, then to y=4 at t=6.\n\nNow at t=6, y=4.\n\ny=5 is unsafe at t=4 and 5, but t=6 is after, so safe to go to y=5 at t=7? Yes.\n\nBut I have to go through y=5 at some point.\n\nIn the sequence, I go to y=5 at t=7.\n\nBut t=7 is fine.\n\nCan I be at y=5 earlier? For example, if I were at y=4 at t=4, but from t=3 y=1, at t=4 I can only be at y=2, not y=4.\n\nImpossible.\n\nFrom y=0 at t=2, if I could jump, but no.\n\nSo I think 10 actions is the minimal.\n\nBut let's count the turns.\n\nStart: t=1, y=1\n\nAction a1: D, to y=0 at t=2\n\nt=2, y=0, action a2: U, to y=1 at t=3\n\nt=3, y=1, action a3: U, to y=2 at t=4\n\nt=4, y=2, action a4: U, to y=3 at t=5\n\nt=5, y=3, action a5: U, to y=4 at t=6\n\nt=6, y=4, action a6: U, to y=5 at t=7\n\nt=7, y=5, action a7: U, to y=6 at t=8\n\nt=8, y=6, action a8: U, to y=7 at t=9\n\nt=9, y=7, action a9: U, to y=8 at t=10\n\nt=10, y=8, action a10: U, to y=9 at t=11\n\nNow, at t=11, y=9, reached.\n\nActions from t=1 to t=10, 10 actions.\n\nH=10.\n\nBut is there a way with less?\n\nFor example, if I don't go down, but I must, because at t=2, I cannot be on y=1-4.\n\nUnless I can be on y=5 at t=2, but impossible from y=1.\n\nPerhaps at t=1, I stay, but if I stay at t=1, y=1 at t=1, then at t=2 y=1, which is unsafe, collision.\n\nIf I go up, y=2 at t=2, unsafe.\n\nSo only down is safe.\n\nThus, I must take at least one down, which adds an extra step.\n\nWithout obstacle, from y=1 to y=9, 8 up moves, 8 actions, to y=9 at t=9.\n\nBut here, because of t=2, I need to go to y=0 first, which takes one extra down and then I have to come back, so two extra actions? Down and up, but in terms of net, I go from y=1 to y=0, then to y=1, so I wasted two actions to be back at y=1 at t=3 instead of t=2.\n\nAt t=1 y=1, if no obstacle, I could be at y=2 at t=2, but now I am at y=1 at t=3, so I lost one turn, then from there I go to y=9 in 8 more actions, total 9 actions? Let's see.\n\nIdeal: t=1 y=1, U to y=2 at t=2, U to y=3 at t=3, ..., U to y=9 at t=9. 8 actions (t=1 to t=8), position at t=9.\n\nBut with obstacle, at t=1, D to y=0 at t=2.\n\nThen from t=2 y=0, U to y=1 at t=3.\n\nThen from t=3 y=1, U to y=2 at t=4, ..., U to y=9 at t=11. Actions t=1 to t=10, 10 actions.\n\nCompared to ideal 8 actions, I have 10, so 2 extra.\n\nBut in this case, from t=3 y=1 to t=11 y=9, that's 8 actions, but I had two actions before: t=1 D and t=2 U, to get to y=1 at t=3.\n\nSo total 10 actions.\n\nNow, about y=5 and 6 at t=4,5, in this path, at t=4 I am at y=2, t=5 at y=3, both safe, and I go to y=5 at t=7, which is after t=5, so no problem.\n\nBut suppose I want to avoid y=5 and 6 at t=4,5, but I am not on them anyway.\n\nPerhaps I can stay on some safe row during t=4,5.\n\nFor example, at some point, I could stay on y=7 or 8, but I need to get there first.\n\nSince y=7 and 8 are always safe, I could go directly to y=7 as fast as possible.\n\nFrom start: t=1 y=1, must go to y=0 at t=2.\n\nt=2 y=0, go to y=1 at t=3.\n\nt=3 y=1, go to y=2 at t=4.\n\nt=4 y=2, go to y=3 at t=5.\n\nt=5 y=3, now at t=5, y=3 is safe, but I need to go to y=4, etc.\n\nBut y=5 is unsafe at t=4 and 5, but t=5 is now, and I am at y=3, not y=5.\n\nIf I go to y=4 at t=6, then to y=5 at t=7, same as before.\n\nNo shortcut.\n\nAfter t=3 y=1, I could go up faster, but cannot.\n\nAnother idea: since y=4 is safe except t=2, and t=2 passed, so y=4 always safe after t=2.\n\nSimilarly, I could go to y=4 and stay, but I need to go up.\n\nNot helpful.\n\nPerhaps I can reach y=9 in fewer than 10 turns by not going all the way down or something, but I think not.\n\nMaybe at t=1, I go down to y=0, then at t=2, instead of going up, I stay at y=0, but that delays, worse.\n\nSo the sequence I have seems optimal.\n\nBut let's confirm the safety at each step.\n\nt=1: y=1, action D\n\nAt t=1, y=1, is it safe? Yes, as computed.\n\nt=2: y=0, action U\n\ny=0, not freeway, safe.\n\nt=3: y=1, action U\n\ny=1, t=3, safe (unsafe only t=2)\n\nt=4: y=2, action U\n\ny=2, t=4, safe (unsafe only t=2)\n\nt=5: y=3, action U\n\ny=3, t=5, safe (unsafe only t=2)\n\nt=6: y=4, action U\n\ny=4, t=6, safe (unsafe only t=2)\n\nt=7: y=5, action U\n\ny=5, t=7, is it safe? y=5 unsafe at t=4 and 5, t=7>5, so safe? Yes, freeway 5 occupied only at t=4,5, so t=7 safe.\n\nSimilarly, t=8: y=6, action U\n\ny=6, t=8, safe, since unsafe only t=4,5.\n\nt=9: y=7, action U\n\ny=7, always safe.\n\nt=10: y=8, action U\n\ny=8, always safe.\n\nThen at t=11: y=9, reached.\n\nAll safe.\n\nNow, H=10 actions.\n\nBut is there a sequence with H=9?\n\nSuppose I start at t=1 y=1.\n\nAction: if I could be at higher y earlier.\n\nFor example, after going down to y=0 at t=2.\n\nThen at t=2, action U to y=1 at t=3.\n\nNow at t=3, y=1, if I do U to y=2 at t=4.\n\nSame as before.\n\nNo.\n\nPerhaps I can go from y=0 to y=1 faster, but no.\n\nAnother thought: at t=5, I am at y=3, which is safe.\n\nBut y=5 is unsafe at t=5, but I am not on it.\n\nIf I were on y=5 at t=5, I would collide, but I am not.\n\nIn this path, I avoid the unsafe times by being elsewhere.\n\nBut can I be at y=9 earlier?\n\nFor example, if I start from t=1, and go up, but I can't at t=2.\n\nUnless I skip some rows, but I can't.\n\nPerhaps I can go down to y=0 and stay, but that doesn't help.\n\nI think 10 is minimal.\n\nBut let's see the answer format.\n\nThe sequence should be actions from t=1 onwards.\n\nIn the sequence above: a1=D, a2=U, a3=U, a4=U, a5=U, a6=U, a7=U, a8=U, a9=U, a10=U\n\nBut H=10, actions from t=1 to t=10.\n\nIn the answer, it should be for turns starting from t1=1.\n\nNow, but I have to write the actions.\n\nIn the car states, freeway 5 and 6 have multiple cars, but we considered, and only unsafe at t=4,5.\n\nIn freeway 5, at t=4 and t=5, 0 is covered, so unsafe.\n\nSimilarly for 6.\n\nIn the path, I am not on them at those times.\n\nPerhaps I can be on y=7 or 8 earlier.\n\nFor example, from t=3 y=1, if I go up, it takes 6 more actions to y=7? From y=1 to y=7: need 6 up, to y=7 at t=9? t=3 y=1, after actions: t=3 action U to y=2 t=4, U to y=3 t=5, U to y=4 t=6, U to y=5 t=7, U to y=6 t=8, U to y=7 t=9.\n\nThen to y=9: U to y=8 t=10, U to y=9 t=11.\n\nSame as before.\n\nIf I go directly, but I have to pass through.\n\nSo I think H=10 is the minimal.\n\nBut let's confirm if at t=4 and t=5, I could be on a safe row.\n\nFor example, at t=4, I could be on y=7 or 8, but from t=3 y=1, I can only be at y=2 at t=4, not y=7.\n\nImpossible.\n\nSimilarly, so no.\n\nThus, the sequence is as above.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to list the actions.\n\nCurrent turn is t1=1.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 1: D\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nAnd H=10.\n\nBut after a10 at turn 10, y11=9.\n\nIn the sequence, t from 0 to H-1, but here t1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nt1=1, so t=0: a_{1+0}=a1\n\nt=1: a2\n\n...\n\nt=H-1: a_{1+H-1} = a_H\n\nSo for H=10, actions a1 to a10.\n\nIn the box, list Turn t1: a_{t1}, etc.\n\nAlso, in the car state, freeway 5 and 6 have cars, but we handled.\n\nAnother thing: at t=7, y=5, is it safe? t=7, freeway 5.\n\nAt t=7, for freeway 5, cars:\n\nFirst car: span at T=7: [43 +6(7-1), 54 +6(6)] = [43+36, 54+36]= [79,90], not near 0.\n\nSecond car: [7+6(6), 18+36]= [43,54], not 0.\n\nThird car: [-29 +6(6), -18+36]= [-29+36, -18+36]= [7,18], min=7>0, so 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly at t=8, y=6.\n\nFreeway 6 same as 5, at t=8: T=8, t-1=7\n\nFirst car: [43+6(7), 54+42]= [43+42,54+42]= [85,96]? 6*(8-1)=6*7=42, so [43+42,54+42]=[85,96]\n\nSecond: [7+42,18+42]=[49,60]\n\nThird: [-29+42, -18+42]=[13,24], all >0, safe.\n\nSo yes.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 10.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), and I do at turn 11.\n\nNow, for the answer format.\n\n\\boxed{ Turn 1: D Turn 2: U Turn 3: U Turn 4: U Turn 5: U Turn 6: U Turn 7: U Turn 8: U Turn 9: U Turn 10: U }\n\nBut H=10, and actions from t=1 to t=10.\n\nIn the sequence, it should be up to turn t1 + H -1 =1+10-1=10, yes.\n\nt1 + H -1 =10.\n\nAnd y at turn (t1 + H) =1+10=11 should be 9.\n\nYes.\n\nPerhaps I can have a sequence where I reach earlier, but I don't think so.\n\nSuppose at t=6, I am at y=4, instead of going up to y=5 at t=7, but I have to go up eventually.\n\nNo.\n\nAnother idea: since y=7 and 8 are safe, I could go to y=8 and stay, but I need to reach y=9, so I have to go up.\n\nNot helpful.\n\nSo I think this is minimal.\n\nThus, the answer.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 1) at turn \\(t_1 = 1\\) and must reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis of Car Occupancy at Position 0\nThe collision occurs at turn \\(T\\) if the player is on freeway \\(k\\) (where \\(1 \\leq k \\leq 8\\)) and position 0 is within the span of any car on that freeway at turn \\(T\\). Based on the car states at turn \\(t_1 = 1\\), the times when position 0 is occupied (unsafe) for each freeway are:\n- Freeway 1: Occupied only at \\(T = 2\\)\n- Freeway 2: Occupied only at \\(T = 2\\)\n- Freeway 3: Occupied only at \\(T = 2\\)\n- Freeway 4: Occupied only at \\(T = 2\\)\n- Freeway 5: Occupied at \\(T = 4\\) and \\(T = 5\\)\n- Freeway 6: Occupied at \\(T = 4\\) and \\(T = 5\\)\n- Freeway 7: Never occupied (always safe)\n- Freeway 8: Never occupied (always safe)\n\n### Path to Reach (0, 9) Minimally\n- At turn \\(T = 1\\), the player is at \\(y = 1\\). Freeway 1 is safe at \\(T = 1\\) (not occupied). However, at \\(T = 2\\), freeways 1 to 4 are unsafe. To avoid collision, the player must not be on \\(y = 1, 2, 3,\\) or \\(4\\) at \\(T = 2\\). The only safe option is to move down to \\(y = 0\\) (not a freeway, so no collision possible). Thus, the action at turn 1 is \\(D\\) (down), resulting in position \\(y = 0\\) at turn 2.\n- At turn \\(T = 2\\), the player is at \\(y = 0\\) (safe). To progress toward \\(y = 9\\), the action is \\(U\\) (up), resulting in position \\(y = 1\\) at turn 3. At \\(T = 3\\), freeway 1 is safe (unsafe only at \\(T = 2\\)).\n- From turn 3 onward, the player can move up directly to \\(y = 9\\), as the unsafe times for freeways 5 and 6 (\\(T = 4\\) and \\(T = 5\\)) are avoided by being on lower freeways at those times:\n  - At \\(T = 4\\), the player is at \\(y = 2\\) (freeway 2, safe at \\(T = 4\\)).\n  - At \\(T = 5\\), the player is at \\(y = 3\\) (freeway 3, safe at \\(T = 5\\)).\n  - Freeways 7 and 8 are always safe, so no delays are needed.\n\nThe sequence of actions to reach \\(y = 9\\) at turn 11 (after 10 actions) is:\n- Turn 1: \\(D\\) → to \\(y = 0\\) at turn 2\n- Turn 2: \\(U\\) → to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 3\n- Turn 3: \\(U\\) → to \\(y = 2\\) at turn 4\n- Turn 4: \\(U\\) → to \\(y = 3\\) at turn 5\n- Turn 5: \\(U\\) → to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 6\n- Turn 6: \\(U\\) → to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 7 (freeway 5 safe at \\(T = 7\\))\n- Turn 7: \\(U\\) → to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 8 (freeway 6 safe at \\(T = 8\\))\n- Turn 8: \\(U\\) → to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 9 (freeway 7 always safe)\n- Turn 9: \\(U\\) → to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 10 (freeway 8 always safe)\n- Turn 10: \\(U\\) → to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 11\n\n### Minimal Number of Turns \\(H\\)\n- The player starts at turn 1 (\\(t_1 = 1\\)).\n- After \\(H = 10\\) actions (turns 1 to 10), the position at turn \\(t_1 + H = 1 + 10 = 11\\) is (0, 9).\n- This path is minimal because:\n  - At turn 2, the player must be at \\(y = 0\\) to avoid collision, requiring an initial down action and adding an extra turn compared to a no-obstacle path.\n  - Any attempt to reach \\(y = 9\\) faster (e.g., in 9 actions) would require being on an unsafe freeway at a critical turn (e.g., on \\(y = 1, 2, 3,\\) or 4 at \\(T = 2\\), or on \\(y = 5\\) or 6 at \\(T = 4\\) or \\(T = 5\\)), causing collision.\n  - The direct upward path after turn 2 avoids all unsafe states and reaches \\(y = 9\\) in the fewest possible turns.\n\nThus, the minimal \\(H = 10\\), and the sequence of actions is as follows.\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 1: D \\\\ \\text{Turn } 2: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 3: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 4: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 5: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: U }",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S) each turn, changing y by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars are moving on each freeway, and I have their positions and speeds at turn t_1 = 2. I need to find a sequence of actions starting from turn 2 to reach y=9 without colliding. Collision happens only if at some turn T, I'm on a freeway y_T, and for that freeway, the car spans include x=0 at that exact turn.\n\nThe note says that if I move to a different y at turn T, I'm not considered on that new y until the next turn, so at turn T, I'm still on y_T, and I only check cars on y_T for collision at turn T.\n\nThe car update: for left-moving cars, span moves left, for right-moving, span moves right. All cars here are right-moving, I think? Let me check the table.\n\nFreeway 1: (0, -23, right, 24) — head at 0, tail at -23? That seems odd because usually head is the front, but for right-moving, head should be larger, I think. Let me read carefully.\n\nIt says: for right-moving, span is [τ, h] with τ < h, and it moves right: [τ + sΔt, h + sΔt]\n\nSimilarly, left-moving: [h, τ] with h < τ, moves left: [h - sΔt, τ - sΔt]\n\nIn the car state, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nFor freeway 1: (0, -23, right, 24). Since it's right-moving, head should be the right end, so at t=2, span is [τ, h] = [-23, 0], so from x=-23 to x=0.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: (24, -11, right, 36) — head 24, tail -11, so span [-11, 24]\n\nFreeway 3: same as 2? (24, -11, right, 36) — probably a typo or same for multiple, but I think it's per freeway, so each freeway has its own cars.\n\nFreeway 4: also (24, -11, right, 36) — same as 2 and 3? That might be a mistake or intentional.\n\nFreeway 5: three cars: (60,49,right,6), (24,13,right,6), (-12,-23,right,6) — all right-moving.\n\nSimilarly freeway 6: same as 5? (60,49,right,6), (24,13,right,6), (-12,-23,right,6)\n\nFreeway 7: (-48,-59,right,12) — head -48, tail -59? For right-moving, if head is -48 and tail -59, since tail should be left, head right, so if both negative, -59 < -48, so tail -59, head -48, span [-59, -48]\n\nThen moves right.\n\nFreeway 8: (56,45,right,4) — head 56, tail 45, span [45,56]\n\nNow, at turn T, collision if I'm on that freeway and 0 is within the span of some car on that freeway at that turn.\n\nThe player starts at turn t_1=2, position (0,0). y=0 is not a freeway, I think freeways are y=1 to y=8, so at y=0, no cars, so no collision. Similarly, y=9 is the goal, probably no cars there.\n\nThe vertical axis y=0 to 9, freeways y=1 to 8 have cars.\n\nSo at start, turn 2, y=0, safe.\n\nI need to reach (0,9), so y=9.\n\nMinimal turns, so probably I want to go up as fast as possible, but avoiding cars.\n\nSince I can only change y by 1 per turn, minimum turns to go from y=0 to y=9 is 9 turns, if I go up every time. But I might need to wait or go down to avoid cars.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway, when a car is at x=0.\n\nThe cars are moving, so for each freeway, I need the times when some car's span includes x=0.\n\nSince all cars are right-moving, and spans are intervals moving right with speed s.\n\nFor a given freeway, at time t (from t_1=2), the position relative to t.\n\nSet t=0 as turn 2, so current turn is t=0.\n\nThen at turn T (relative to t_1, so absolute turn is t_1 + T), for a car with initial span [τ, h] at T=0, speed s, right-moving.\n\nAt time T, span is [τ + s*T, h + s*T]\n\nCollision if y_T = k and 0 ∈ [τ + s*T, h + s*T] for some car on freeway k.\n\nSince the span includes 0 if τ + s*T ≤ 0 ≤ h + s*T.\n\nBut for right-moving, τ is left, h is right, so τ ≤ h, so 0 ∈ [τ + sT, h + sT] iff τ + sT ≤ 0 ≤ h + sT.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but all are right-moving here.\n\nNow, for each freeway, list the cars and find for which T, the inequality holds for some car.\n\nAlso, since multiple cars per freeway, I need to check all.\n\nStart with freeway 1: only one car: (head, tail) = (0, -23) at T=0, speed 24.\n\nSo span at T: [-23 + 24T, 0 + 24T] = [-23 + 24T, 24T]\n\n0 ∈ [-23 + 24T, 24T] iff -23 + 24T ≤ 0 ≤ 24T\n\nFirst inequality: -23 + 24T ≤ 0 ⇒ 24T ≤ 23 ⇒ T ≤ 23/24 ≈ 0.958\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ 24T ⇒ T ≥ 0\n\nBut T is integer, since turns are discrete.\n\nT is turn index, starting from 0.\n\nT ≥ 0 and T ≤ 0.958, so T=0 only? T=0: -23 +0 ≤0 ≤0? 0 ≤0 is true, and -23≤0 true, so yes, at T=0, 0 is in [-23,0].\n\nBut T=0 is the current turn, turn t_1=2, and player is at y=0, which is not freeway 1, freeway 1 is y=1.\n\ny=0 has no freeway, so no collision.\n\nAt turn T, we care only if player is on that freeway, i.e., y_T = k for freeway k.\n\nFor freeway 1, we need to know when collision happens if player is on y=1 at turn T.\n\nAt turn T, 0 ∈ span for freeway 1 iff -23 + 24T ≤ 0 ≤ 24T\n\nSince T integer, 0 ≤ 24T always for T≥0, and -23 +24T ≤0 ⇒ 24T ≤23 ⇒ T ≤ 23/24 <1, so T=0 only.\n\nT=0: -23 ≤0 ≤0, yes.\n\nBut T=0 is current turn, and at T=0, player is at y=0, not on freeway 1, so no issue.\n\nFor T≥1, 24T ≥24 >23, so -23+24T ≥1 >0, so 0 < -23+24T ≤ something, so 0 not in [ -23+24T, 24T] for T≥1.\n\nFor T=1: [ -23+24, 24] = [1,24], 0 not in [1,24]\n\nSimilarly, T=2: [25,48], etc.\n\nSo for freeway 1, only at T=0 there is a car at x=0, but since player not on y=1 at T=0, it's fine. For later turns, no car at x=0 on freeway 1.\n\nNow freeway 2: cars: (24, -11, right, 36) — head 24, tail -11, so at T=0, span [-11,24]\n\nAt time T, [ -11 +36T, 24 +36T]\n\n0 ∈ this iff -11 +36T ≤ 0 ≤ 24 +36T\n\nLeft: -11 +36T ≤0 ⇒ 36T ≤11 ⇒ T ≤ 11/36 ≈ 0.305\n\nRight: 0 ≤ 24 +36T always true for T≥0\n\nSo T ≤ 0.305, since T integer, T=0 only.\n\nT=0: -11 ≤0 ≤24, true.\n\nBut at T=0, player not on y=2.\n\nFor T≥1, -11+36T ≥ -11+36=25>0, so 0 not in [25 + something, bigger], so no.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as freeway 2, (24,-11,right,36), so same, only T=0 has car at x=0.\n\nFreeway 4: same, only T=0.\n\nNow freeway 5: multiple cars.\n\nFirst car: (60,49,right,6) — head 60, tail 49? For right-moving, tail should be left, head right, so if tail 49, head 60, span [49,60] at T=0.\n\nAt T, [49+6T, 60+6T]\n\n0 ∈ [49+6T, 60+6T] iff 49+6T ≤0 ≤60+6T\n\nBut 49+6T ≤0? 49+6T ≥49>0 for T≥0, so always false. 0 not in this interval since min is 49>0. So this car never at x=0.\n\nSecond car: (24,13,right,6) — head 24, tail 13, span [13,24] at T=0.\n\nAt T, [13+6T, 24+6T]\n\n0 ∈ iff 13+6T ≤0 ≤24+6T\n\n13+6T ≤0? 13+6T ≥13>0, so false. Never.\n\nThird car: (-12,-23,right,6) — head -12, tail -23, since right-moving, tail left, head right, so tail -23, head -12, span [-23,-12] at T=0.\n\nAt T, [-23+6T, -12+6T]\n\n0 ∈ iff -23+6T ≤0 ≤ -12+6T\n\nLeft: -23+6T ≤0 ⇒ 6T ≤23 ⇒ T≤23/6≈3.833\n\nRight: 0 ≤ -12+6T ⇒ 6T ≥12 ⇒ T≥2\n\nSo for T integer, T=2,3\n\nT=2: -23+12= -11 ≤0? -11≤0 true, and 0 ≤ -12+12=0, 0≤0 true.\n\nT=3: -23+18= -5 ≤0 true, 0 ≤ -12+18=6, true.\n\nT=4: -23+24=1 ≤0? 1≤0 false, and 0 ≤ -12+24=12 true, but left false, so no.\n\nSo for freeway 5, car 3 at x=0 when T=2 and T=3.\n\nT relative to t_1=2, so absolute turn 4 and 5.\n\nBut we need for player position.\n\nNow freeway 6: same cars as freeway 5? The table says freeway 6: (60,49,right,6), (24,13,right,6), (-12,-23,right,6) — identical to freeway 5.\n\nSo same, at T=2 and T=3, x=0 occupied on freeway 6.\n\nNow freeway 7: (-48,-59,right,12) — head -48, tail -59? Tail left, head right, so span [-59,-48] at T=0.\n\nAt T, [-59+12T, -48+12T]\n\n0 ∈ iff -59+12T ≤0 ≤ -48+12T\n\nLeft: -59+12T ≤0 ⇒ 12T ≤59 ⇒ T≤59/12≈4.916\n\nRight: 0 ≤ -48+12T ⇒ 12T ≥48 ⇒ T≥4\n\nSo T=4, since T integer.\n\nT=4: -59+48= -11 ≤0 true, 0 ≤ -48+48=0 true.\n\nT=5: -59+60=1 ≤0? false.\n\nSo only T=4.\n\nFreeway 8: (56,45,right,4) — head 56, tail 45, span [45,56] at T=0.\n\nAt T, [45+4T, 56+4T]\n\n0 ∈? 45+4T ≥45>0, so min >0, never contains 0.\n\nSo summary of dangerous times for each freeway:\n\n- Freeway 1: only T=0, but not relevant since player not there at T=0.\n\n- Freeway 2: only T=0, not relevant.\n\n- Freeway 3: only T=0, not relevant.\n\n- Freeway 4: only T=0, not relevant.\n\n- Freeway 5: occupied at T=2 and T=3\n\n- Freeway 6: occupied at T=2 and T=3 (same as 5)\n\n- Freeway 7: occupied at T=4\n\n- Freeway 8: never occupied\n\nFreeway 5 and 6 both occupied at T=2 and T=3.\n\nFreeway 7 at T=4.\n\nPlayer starts at T=0, y=0.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nEach turn, y changes by -1,0,1.\n\nMinimum 9 turns to go from 0 to 9 with all U.\n\nBut we need to avoid being on freeway when occupied.\n\nFreeways are y=1 to 8.\n\nSo for y=5, it is occupied at T=2 and T=3\n\nSimilarly y=6 at T=2 and T=3\n\ny=7 at T=4\n\ny=1,2,3,4,8 not occupied at any T except T=0 which is past.\n\ny=1 to 4: only dangerous at T=0, but T=0 is over, so for T>=1, no danger on y=1,2,3,4.\n\ny=8 never dangerous.\n\ny=5 dangerous at T=2,3\n\ny=6 dangerous at T=2,3\n\ny=7 dangerous at T=4\n\nT is turn index from 0.\n\nNow, player position: let y_t be the y position at turn t (relative, t=0,1,2,...)\n\nStart t=0, y=0.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at some turn H, so after H turns, y_H =9.\n\nt from 0 to H, H turns means from t=0 to t=H, H+1 positions? Let's clarify.\n\nTurn: at turn T, we perform action a_{t1 + T}, which determines y_{T+1} from y_T.\n\nDefine:\n\nAt the beginning of turn T (relative), player is at position y_T.\n\nThen we choose action a_T, which determines y_{T+1} = y_T + delta y, with delta y based on a_T.\n\nCollision check at turn T: when we are at position y_T, we check if for freeway k = y_T, if there is a car with 0 in span at turn T.\n\nIf we move to a different y, at turn T we are still on y_T, so we only check cars on y_T at turn T.\n\nThen after action, we move to y_{T+1}.\n\nStart: at turn T=0, position y_0 = 0.\n\nSince y=0 not freeway, no collision possible at T=0.\n\nAfter action a_0, we go to y_1, and so on.\n\nWe need to reach y_H = 9 for some H, and H is the number of turns, so from T=0 to T=H-1, we take actions, and at turn H, we are at y_H.\n\nThe sequence: actions from T=0 to T=H-1, position from y_0 to y_H.\n\nCollision at each turn T=0 to T=H-1: at position y_T, if y_T is between 1 and 8, check if freeway y_T has a car at x=0 at turn T.\n\nAt turn H, we are at y_H=9, no freeway, no collision.\n\nIn the problem, it says \"reach (0,9)\", and \"y_{t1 + H -1} =9\", let's see.\n\nGiven: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" so t from 0 to H-1, actions.\n\nThen \"y_{t1 + H -1} =9\" after H actions, at time t1 + H -1, position y=9.\n\nSet t1=2.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t.\n\nAt turn t1=2, y_2 =0.\n\nThen action a_2 determines y_3, and so on.\n\nAfter action a_{t1 + H -1}, we have y_{t1 + H} =9? Let's index properly.\n\nSet the turn index.\n\nLet the current turn be turn 0 relative.\n\nTurn relative: T=0,1,2,... corresponds to absolute turn t1 + T = 2 + T.\n\nPosition: at turn T (relative), before action, position y_T.\n\nAfter action a_T, position y_{T+1}.\n\nCollision: at turn T, position y_T, if 1<= y_T <=8, check if freeway y_T has car at x=0 at turn T.\n\nWe need to find min H such that after H actions, y_H =9.\n\nThat is, actions from T=0 to T=H-1, positions from y_0 to y_H.\n\ny_0=0, y_H=9.\n\nThe number of actions is H, and we go from y_0 to y_H in H steps.\n\nH min is 9 if all up.\n\nNow, we need to avoid being on dangerous freeways at dangerous times.\n\nDangerous times:\n\nFreeway y=5: dangerous at T=2 and T=3\n\ny=6: dangerous at T=2 and T=3\n\ny=7: dangerous at T=4\n\ny=1,2,3,4,8: safe at all T since no cars at x=0 except T=0 which is past.\n\ny=8 never dangerous.\n\nNow, we need to plan a path from y=0 to y=9 in min steps.\n\ny_t for t=0,1,2,3,...\n\nStart t=0, y=0.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nBut we might need to avoid being at y=5 or 6 at t=2 or t=3, and at y=7 at t=4.\n\nt is the turn index, from 0.\n\nNow, let's list the dangerous points:\n\n- At turn t=2, if y_2=5 or y_2=6, collision\n\n- At turn t=3, if y_3=5 or y_3=6, collision\n\n- At turn t=4, if y_4=7, collision\n\nAt other times, all freeways are safe.\n\nSince y=1-4 and 8 always safe.\n\ny=5 and 6 only dangerous at t=2 and 3, y=7 only at t=4.\n\nOtherwise safe.\n\nNow, to go from y=0 to y=9 in min time.\n\nMin steps: 9 steps to go from 0 to 9 with +1 each time.\n\nBut we might be forced to not move up at some points.\n\nSince we can stay or go down, but going down might waste time.\n\nLet's see the constraints.\n\nFirst, at t=0: position y_0=0, not freeway, safe. Action a_0, to y_1.\n\ny_1 can be 0,1 (since U or S, D to -1 invalid, y between 0 and 9).\n\ny_1 = y_0 + delta, delta in {-1,0,1} but y must in [0,9], so from y=0, can go to 0 or 1.\n\nSimilarly, at y=9, can go to 8 or 9, but we stop when reach 9.\n\nNow, we need to avoid:\n\n- At t=2, y_2 not 5 or 6\n\n- At t=3, y_3 not 5 or 6\n\n- At t=4, y_4 not 7\n\nNow, y_t changes slowly.\n\nLet me denote the position sequence.\n\nStart t=0, y=0.\n\nt=1: y_1 can be 0 or 1\n\nt=2: y_2 depends on y_1 and action.\n\nWe need y_2 !=5 and y_2 !=6\n\nSimilarly y_3 !=5 and !=6\n\ny_4 !=7\n\nAnd we want to reach y=9 asap.\n\nSince min steps 9, let's see if we can do it in 9 steps.\n\nSuppose all U: y_0=0, y_1=1, y_2=2, y_3=3, y_4=4, y_5=5, y_6=6, y_7=7, y_8=8, y_9=9.\n\nNow check collisions:\n\nAt t=2, y_2=2, which is freeway 2, but freeway 2 is safe except t=0, so at t=2, y=2, freeway 2, not dangerous, safe.\n\nSimilarly t=3, y_3=3, freeway 3, safe.\n\nt=4, y_4=4, freeway 4, safe.\n\nt=5, y_5=5, freeway 5, at t=5? t=5 relative.\n\nDangerous for y=5 at t=2 and 3.\n\nt=5, not dangerous, so safe.\n\nSimilarly y_6=6 at t=6, not dangerous.\n\ny_7=7 at t=7, dangerous only at t=4, t=7 safe.\n\nAll seem fine? But at t=4, y_4=4, safe.\n\nIn this sequence, at t=2, y=2 not 5 or 6, good.\n\nt=3, y=3 not 5 or 6, good.\n\nt=4, y=4 not 7, good.\n\nAnd no issue at other times.\n\nBut y=5 at t=5, which is safe since dangerous only t=2,3.\n\nSimilarly y=6 at t=6 safe.\n\ny=7 at t=7, dangerous only t=4, so t=7 safe.\n\ny=8 at t=8, safe.\n\ny=9 at t=9.\n\nSo with all U, in 9 steps, we reach y=9 at t=9, no collision.\n\nIs that right?\n\nt=0: y=0, not freeway\n\nt=1: y=1, freeway 1. Is it dangerous? Freeway 1 dangerous only at t=0, not t=1, so safe.\n\nt=2: y=2, freeway 2, dangerous only t=0, not t=2, safe.\n\nSimilarly t=3: y=3, freeway 3, safe.\n\nt=4: y=4, freeway 4, safe.\n\nt=5: y=5, freeway 5, at t=5. Dangerous at t=2,3, not t=5, so safe.\n\nt=6: y=6, freeway 6, dangerous t=2,3, not t=6, safe.\n\nt=7: y=7, freeway 7, dangerous at t=4, not t=7, safe.\n\nt=8: y=8, freeway 8, never dangerous, safe.\n\nt=9: y=9, not freeway, goal.\n\nSo all good? But the problem is to avoid collisions, and here no collision.\n\nBut why do I think there might be an issue? Perhaps I missed something.\n\nFreeway 5 has cars at x=0 at t=2 and t=3 only.\n\nIn the sequence, at t=5, y=5, but t=5 not dangerous, so no car at x=0, so safe.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut let me confirm the dangerous times.\n\nt relative to t1=2.\n\nFor freeway 5, occupied at T=2 and T=3.\n\nT=2 corresponds to absolute turn t1 + T = 2+2=4? No.\n\nI think I confused the indexing.\n\nSet absolute turns.\n\nCurrent turn: turn t1=2, position (0,0)\n\nTurn index: let τ be absolute turn.\n\nAt τ=2, position y=0.\n\nAction a_2 determines y at τ=3.\n\nGenerally: at turn τ, position y_τ, action a_τ, then y_{τ+1} = y_τ + Δy.\n\nCollision at turn τ: if 1<= y_τ <=8, and for freeway k=y_τ, there is a car with 0 in span at turn τ.\n\nCars at turn τ=2 (current state).\n\nFor freeway 5: at τ=2, car spans: we found that for the third car, at relative T=0, span [-23,-12], but at absolute turn.\n\nBetter to use absolute turn.\n\nSet τ = absolute turn.\n\nAt τ=2, initial state.\n\nFor freeway 5, cars:\n\n- (60,49,right,6): at τ=2, span [49,60], moves right, so at turn τ, span [49 + 6(τ-2), 60 + 6(τ-2)]? Since speed per turn.\n\nThe update: from turn t1 to T, Δt = T - t1.\n\nSo at turn T, span for a car: if right-moving, [τ + s(T - t1), h + s(T - t1)]\n\nWith initial at t1.\n\nt1=2.\n\nSo for freeway 5, car 3: head h=-12, tail τ=-23? Tail is -23, head -12, so at T, [ -23 + 6(T-2), -12 + 6(T-2) ]\n\n0 in span if -23 +6(T-2) <= 0 <= -12 +6(T-2)\n\nSet u = T-2, relative to t1.\n\nThen as before, -23 +6u <=0 and 0<= -12+6u\n\nWhich is u <= 23/6≈3.833 and u>=2, so u=2,3.\n\nu relative, so at absolute T when u=2, T=4; u=3, T=5.\n\nT=4 and T=5.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 6, same, at T=4 and T=5.\n\nFreeway 7: car (-48,-59,right,12), at T, [ -59 +12(T-2), -48 +12(T-2) ]\n\n0 in if -59+12(T-2) <=0 <= -48+12(T-2)\n\nLet v = T-2\n\n-59+12v <=0 => 12v <=59 => v<=59/12≈4.916\n\n0 <= -48+12v => 12v >=48 => v>=4\n\nSo v=4, T=6? v=4: T=2+4=6\n\nv=4: T=6\n\nEarlier I had T=4 relative, but relative T=4, absolute T=6.\n\nI think I messed up the indexing.\n\nDefine:\n\nRelative turn index: let t be the number of turns since t1, so t=0,1,2,... for turns t1, t1+1, t1+2, ...\n\nAt turn t1 + t, position y_{t1 + t}\n\nIn the collision check, at turn T = t1 + t, for freeway k, if y_{t1 + t} = k, and 0 in span at that turn.\n\nNow, spans at turn T depend on initial at t1=2.\n\nFor freeway 5, car: at T, span [ -23 + 6(T - 2), -12 + 6(T - 2) ] for the third car.\n\n0 in if -23 +6(T-2) <=0 <= -12 +6(T-2)\n\nSet Δt = T - 2\n\n-23 +6Δt <=0 and 0<= -12 +6Δt\n\nSo 6Δt <=23 and 6Δt >=12\n\nΔt <= 23/6 ≈3.833, Δt >=2\n\nΔt integer, so Δt=2 or 3\n\nThus T - 2 =2 or 3, so T=4 or 5.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 6, same, T=4 or 5.\n\nFor freeway 7: [ -59 +12(T-2), -48 +12(T-2) ]\n\n0 in if -59+12(T-2) <=0 <= -48+12(T-2)\n\nΔt = T-2\n\n-59+12Δt <=0 => 12Δt <=59 => Δt <= 59/12≈4.916\n\n0 <= -48+12Δt => 12Δt >=48 => Δt >=4\n\nSo Δt=4, T=2+4=6\n\nNow, for freeway 1: at T, [ -23 +24(T-2), 0 +24(T-2) ] since head 0, tail -23\n\n0 in if -23+24Δt <=0 <= 24Δt\n\nΔt <= 23/24 <1, Δt >=0, so Δt=0, T=2\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nNow, player position:\n\nAt absolute turn τ, y_τ.\n\nStart τ=2, y=0.\n\nAction a_τ for τ=2,3,4,... determines y_{τ+1}\n\nAfter H actions, y_{2+H} =9.\n\nThe sequence of actions from τ=2 to τ=2+H-1, so H actions.\n\ny at τ=2,3,4,..., up to y_{2+H} =9.\n\nCollision at each turn τ from 2 to 2+H-1, if y_τ between 1 and 8, and freeway y_τ occupied at τ.\n\nDangerous turns:\n\n- For y=5: occupied at τ=4 and τ=5\n\n- For y=6: occupied at τ=4 and τ=5 (same as above)\n\n- For y=7: occupied at τ=6\n\n- Others not occupied except τ=2, but at τ=2 y=0 not freeway.\n\nNow, in the all-up plan:\n\nAssume we go up each turn.\n\nStart τ=2, y=0\n\na_2: U, to y_3=1\n\nAt τ=3, y=1, freeway 1. Occupied? Freeway 1 only at τ=2, not τ=3, so safe.\n\na_3: U, to y_4=2\n\nAt τ=4, y=2, freeway 2. Occupied? Freeway 2 only at τ=2, not τ=4, safe.\n\na_4: U, to y_5=3\n\nAt τ=5, y=3, freeway 3.

No.\n\ny_{2+H} =9.\n\nAfter H actions, y_{2+H} =9.\n\nStart at τ=2, y=0.\n\nAfter 0 actions, y=0.\n\nAfter 1 action, y_3=1 if U, etc.\n\nAfter 9 actions: y_{11} =9.\n\nPositions: τ=2, y=0\n\nτ=3, y=1\n\n...\n\nτ=11, y=9\n\nCollision at τ from 2 to 10, since at each turn from τ=2 to τ=10, we are at position before action.\n\nAt τ=10, y=8, freeway 8, safe.\n\nAt τ=11, y=9, not freeway, no collision check, or we have reached.\n\nIn the sequence, we need to specify actions until we reach y=9 at some turn.\n\nWith all U, from τ=2 to τ=11, y from 0 to 9, 9 actions.\n\nBut at τ=4, y=2, not 5 or 6, safe.\n\nτ=5, y=3, safe.\n\nThe dangerous points are at τ=4,5 for y=5,6; τ=6 for y=7.\n\nIn this path, at τ=4, y=2, not on y=5 or 6.\n\nAt τ=5, y=3, not on y=5 or 6.\n\nAt τ=6, y=4, not on y=7.\n\nSo all fine, no issue.\n\nBut perhaps I can reach faster? From y=0 to y=9, min 9 actions, since each action changes y by at most 1.\n\nSo 9 is minimum possible.\n\nAnd here it works with all U.\n\nBut the problem might have obstacles that force a detour, but in this case, not.\n\nPerhaps I misread the car positions.\n\nAnother thing: freeway 5 and 6 are both dangerous at τ=4 and 5, but in the path, we are not there at those times.\n\nSimilarly for y=7 at τ=6.\n\nIn the sequence, we are at y=4 at τ=6, which is safe.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nBut let me list the actions.\n\nStart τ=2, y=0\n\nAction a_2: U, to y=1 at τ=3\n\nAt τ=3, position y=1, freeway 1: not occupied (only at τ=2), safe.\n\nAction a_3: U, to y=2 at τ=4\n\nAt τ=4, position y=2, freeway 2: not occupied (only τ=2), safe.\n\nAction a_4: U, to y=3 at τ=5\n\nAt τ=5, position y=3, freeway 3: not occupied, safe.\n\nAction a_5: U, to y=4 at τ=6\n\nAt τ=6, position y=4, freeway 4: safe.\n\nAction a_6: U, to y=5 at τ=7\n\nAt τ=7, position y=5, freeway 5: occupied at τ=4 and 5, not τ=7, so no car at x=0, safe.\n\nAction a_7: U, to y=6 at τ=8\n\nAt τ=8, position y=6, freeway 6: occupied at τ=4 and 5, not τ=8, safe.\n\nAction a_8: U, to y=7 at τ=9\n\nAt τ=9, position y=7, freeway 7: occupied at τ=6, not τ=9, safe.\n\nAction a_9: U, to y=8 at τ=10\n\nAt τ=10, position y=8, freeway 8: safe.\n\nAction a_10: U, to y=9 at τ=11\n\nAt τ=11, y=9, goal.\n\nNow, the sequence of actions: from τ=2 to τ=10, actions a_2 to a_10, 9 actions.\n\nIn the answer, it should be actions from turn t1 to t1+H-1, with y_{t1+H-1} =9? Let's see the problem.\n\n\"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\", and \"y_{t1 + H -1} =9\"\n\nAfter actions from t=0 to H-1 relative, so absolute from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nThen y_{t1 + H -1} =9? After the actions.\n\nAfter actions a_{t1} to a_{t1+H-2}, we have y_{t1+H-1}, and we need y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nDefine:\n\nLet the actions be applied at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\nAfter action at turn τ, position y_{τ+1} is set.\n\nAt turn τ, before action, position y_τ.\n\nAfter action, y_{τ+1}.\n\nStart at turn t1=2, y_2=0.\n\nApply action a_2, get y_3.\n\nApply a_3, get y_4, ..., apply a_{t1+H-1} = a_{2+H-1} = a_{1+H}, get y_{2+H}.\n\nWe need y_{2+H} =9.\n\nAnd H minimal.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from a_2 to a_{1+H}, H actions? Indices.\n\nThe actions are a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, so a_{2+0}, a_{2+1}, ..., a_{2+H-1}\n\nAfter applying these, y_{2+H} =9.\n\nNumber of actions: H.\n\nCollisions checked at each turn from τ=2 to τ=2+H-1, position y_τ.\n\nFor y_{2+H}=9, no collision at τ=2+H since not freeway.\n\nIn all U case, with H=9:\n\nActions: a_2, a_3, ..., a_{10} (since 2+9-1=10? t from 0 to 8 for H=9? t=0 to H-1=8, so actions a_{2+0}=a_2 to a_{2+8}=a_{10}\n\nThen y_{2+9}=y_{11}=9\n\nPositions: at τ=2, y=0\n\nτ=3, y=1\n\n...\n\nτ=11, y=9\n\nCollision at τ=2: y=0, not freeway\n\nτ=3: y=1, freeway 1, not occupied (occ at τ=2)\n\nτ=4: y=2, freeway 2, not occ\n\nτ=5: y=3, freeway 3, not occ\n\nτ=6: y=4, freeway 4, not occ\n\nτ=7: y=5, freeway 5, occ at τ=4,5, not τ=7\n\nτ=8: y=6, freeway 6, occ at τ=4,5, not τ=8\n\nτ=9: y=7, freeway 7, occ at τ=6, not τ=9\n\nτ=10: y=8, freeway 8, not occ\n\nAll safe.\n\nSo minimal H is 9, with all U.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\", and here H=9.\n\nBut perhaps I can do it in less? No, 9 is min.\n\nMaybe with stay or down, but that would take more turns, so 9 is best.\n\nBut why is the car state given? Maybe for other paths, but in this case, no issue.\n\nPerhaps I misread the car on freeway 7.\n\nFreeway 7 occupied at τ=6.\n\nIn the path, at τ=6, y=4, not 7.\n\nAt τ=9, y=7, not occupied.\n\nSo all good.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 5, at τ=4 and 5 occupied, but we are at y=2 and 3 at those times.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nBut let me confirm the answer format.\n\nThe sequence should be:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} = a_2\n\nTurn t_1 +1: a_3\n\n...\n\nUp to a_{10} for H=9.\n\nt from 0 to H-1, so for H=9, actions a_2 to a_{10}, but a_{10} is applied at τ=10, to go to y=9 at τ=11.\n\nIn the position, at turn τ=10, we are at y=8, apply U, go to y=9 at next turn.\n\nBut the collision is checked at τ=10, y=8, safe.\n\nThen at τ=11, y=9, no action needed.\n\nNow, the sequence of actions: a_2 to a_{10}, which is 9 actions.\n\nIn the box, list the actions.\n\nBut the turn labels: Turn t_1: a_{t_1}, which is a_2\n\nTurn t_1 +1: a_3\n\n...\n\nTurn t_1 + 8: a_{10} since t_1 + (H-1) = 2 + 8 =10 for H=9.\n\nH-1 =8.\n\nActions from t=0 to H-1, so for t=0: turn t1, action a_{t1}\n\nt=1: turn t1+1, action a_{t1+1}\n\n...\n\nt=H-1: turn t1 + H-1, action a_{t1 + H-1}\n\nThen after that, y_{t1 + H} =9.\n\nIn this case, for H=9, actions at turns 2 to 10.\n\na_2 to a_{10}.\n\nAll actions U.\n\nBut the problem might expect a sequence where we avoid, but here no need.\n\nPerhaps I have a mistake in freeway 5.\n\nFreeway 5 at τ=4: occupied.\n\nAt τ=4, if y=5, collision.\n\nBut in our path, at τ=4, y=2, not 5.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nAnother thing: the note says \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T\", which we already considered, at turn T, on y_T.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 6, same as 5.\n\nBut freeway 6 is different freeway, but same car config.\n\nIn the table, freeway 5 and 6 have identical cars, so same occupation times.\n\nBut in the path, we are not on them at τ=4,5.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think H=9 with all U is fine.\n\nBut let me see if we can reach faster, but impossible.\n\nOr with less actions, no.\n\nPerhaps we can be at y=9 earlier if we move faster, but we can't, max +1 per turn.\n\nUnless start from higher, but start from 0.\n\nSo minimal H=9.\n\nSequence: all U.\n\nBut in the answer, list the actions.\n\nBut the car state might be for something else, or perhaps I need to output.\n\nMaybe for y=7 at τ=6 dangerous, but we are not there.\n\nPerhaps in the sequence, if we go slower.\n\nBut no need.\n\nSo I think the answer is 9 turns with all Up actions.\n\nSo actions: from turn 2 to turn 10, all U.\n\nIn the box:\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nBut turn 10 is t1 + 8, since H=9, t from 0 to 8.\n\nt1=2, actions at t1 + t for t=0 to 8: turns 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10.\n\nYes.\n\nAfter a_{10}, y_{11}=9.\n\nNow, to write the answer.\n\nBut the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", H=9.\n\nSequence as above.\n\nBut let me make sure about freeway 7.\n\nAt τ=6, freeway 7 occupied.\n\nIn path, at τ=6, y=4, not 7.\n\nAt τ=9, y=7, not occupied.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps we can have a shorter path if we go down, but that would increase time, so no.\n\nOr stay, also waste time.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 2\\) is 9, with the sequence of actions being all \"U\" (up). This sequence avoids collisions with cars on the freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) as follows:\n\n- At turn 2, the player is at \\((0, 0)\\), which is not a freeway, so no collision is possible.\n- At turn 3, the player is at \\((0, 1)\\) (freeway 1). Freeway 1 has a car that occupies \\(x = 0\\) only at turn 2, not at turn 3, so it is safe.\n- At turn 4, the player is at \\((0, 2)\\) (freeway 2). Freeway 2 has a car that occupies \\(x = 0\\) only at turn 2, not at turn 4, so it is safe.\n- At turn 5, the player is at \\((0, 3)\\) (freeway 3). Freeway 3 has a car that occupies \\(x = 0\\) only at turn 2, not at turn 5, so it is safe.\n- At turn 6, the player is at \\((0, 4)\\) (freeway 4). Freeway 4 has no car at \\(x = 0\\) at any turn except turn 2, so it is safe at turn 6.\n- At turn 7, the player is at \\((0, 5)\\) (freeway 5). Freeway 5 has cars that occupy \\(x = 0\\) only at turns 4 and 5, not at turn 7, so it is safe.\n- At turn 8, the player is at \\((0, 6)\\) (freeway 6). Freeway 6 has cars that occupy \\(x = 0\\) only at turns 4 and 5, not at turn 8, so it is safe.\n- At turn 9, the player is at \\((0, 7)\\) (freeway 7). Freeway 7 has a car that occupies \\(x = 0\\) only at turn 6, not at turn 9, so it is safe.\n- At turn 10, the player is at \\((0, 8)\\) (freeway 8). Freeway 8 has no car at \\(x = 0\\) at any turn, so it is safe.\n\nAfter the action at turn 10, the player reaches \\((0, 9)\\) at turn 11, which is the goal and not a freeway.\n\nThe sequence of actions is all \"U\" because moving up each turn is the fastest way to reach \\(y = 9\\) from \\(y = 0\\), and there are no collisions in this path given the car positions and movements. Alternative sequences, such as using \"S\" (stay) or \"D\" (down), would require more turns and are not minimal.\n\nThus, the minimal \\(H\\) is 9, with the actions:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 2: U \\\\\nTurn 3: U \\\\\nTurn 4: U \\\\\nTurn 5: U \\\\\nTurn 6: U \\\\\nTurn 7: U \\\\\nTurn 8: U \\\\\nTurn 9: U \\\\\nTurn 10: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 3, and the player is at (0,1). The goal is to reach (0,9) in the minimal number of turns without colliding with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nFirst, note that the player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S). The vertical position y is updated as:\n  y_{t+1} = y_t + 1 (if U)\n  y_{t+1} = y_t - 1 (if D)\n  y_{t+1} = y_t (if S)\n\nand y must stay in [0,9].\n\nThe collision condition: at turn T, if the player is at (0, y_T) and there is a car on freeway y_T such that 0 is in the car's span at that turn, then a collision occurs.\n\nImportant: when moving from y_T to y_{T+1} at turn T, at the moment of turn T, the player is still on y_T. So we only check the freeway corresponding to the current y position at turn T.\n\nWe are starting at turn 3 (t1=3) at (0,1). We need to plan a sequence of actions until we reach y=9.\n\nWe note that we are currently at y=1. We have to avoid cars on the freeways we are on at each turn.\n\nLet me list the car configurations for each freeway at turn 3 (the current turn). But note: the cars are moving over time. For a future turn T (>=3), the car positions will change.\n\nWe have:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (head=24, tail=1, direction=right, speed=24)\n  Since it's right-moving, the car spans from tail to head: [1, 24] at turn 3.\n  At turn T, the car will be at: [1 + 24*(T-3), 24 + 24*(T-3)] = [24*(T-3)+1, 24*(T-3)+24]\n\nFreeway 2: one car: (head=60, tail=25, direction=right, speed=36)\n  At turn 3: [25,60]\n  At turn T: [25 + 36*(T-3), 60 + 36*(T-3)]\n\nFreeway 3: same as freeway 2? \n  | 3 | (60, 25, right, 36) | -> same as freeway 2.\n\nFreeway 4: same as freeway 2 and 3? \n  | 4 | (60, 25, right, 36) | -> same.\n\nFreeway 5: three cars: \n  (-48, -59, right, 6) -> at turn 3: [-59, -48]? \n  But note: the representation says (head, tail, direction, speed). For right-moving, the head is the rightmost? So the car spans from tail to head? \n  Actually, the update rule for right-moving: \n      Span(T) = [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n  So for the first car: tail=-59, head=-48, so at turn 3: [-59, -48]? But the update rule for right-moving at T: \n      [tau + s*(T-3), head + s*(T-3)] = [-59 + 6*(T-3), -48 + 6*(T-3)]\n\n  Similarly, the second car: (30,19,right,6) -> [19+6*(T-3), 30+6*(T-3)]\n  Third car: (-6,-17,right,6) -> [-17+6*(T-3), -6+6*(T-3)]\n\nFreeway 6: same as freeway 5? \n  | 6 | same three cars: (-48,-59,right,6), (30,19,right,6), (-6,-17,right,6)\n\nFreeway 7: (-36,-47,right,12) -> [-47+12*(T-3), -36+12*(T-3)]\n\nFreeway 8: (60,49,right,4) -> [49+4*(T-3), 60+4*(T-3)]\n\nWe start at turn 3 at y=1. We need to check freeway 1 at turn 3: \n  The car on freeway 1 at turn 3: [1,24]. Is 0 in [1,24]? No, so we are safe at turn 3.\n\nNow, we plan a path to y=9. We can only change y by at most 1 per turn, so we need at least 8 moves (if we only go up). But we might have to wait because of cars.\n\nWe have to avoid collisions on the freeways we are on at each turn. Note that we start at y=1 at turn 3, and we want to end at y=9.\n\nWe can consider moving up as fast as possible, but we must check for each freeway we step on.\n\nSince the goal is to minimize the number of turns, we want to go up as much as possible, but if there is a car that would hit 0 at the turn we are on a freeway, we must avoid that.\n\nWe can simulate turn by turn. We start at turn 3, y=1.\n\nTurn 3 (current): y=1 -> check freeway 1: car [1,24] at turn 3 -> 0 is not in [1,24] -> safe.\n\nWe choose an action for turn 3. We can choose U, D, or S. Since we want to go up, U would be the first choice.\n\nBut let's see the next freeway: y=2. We will be on freeway 2 at the next turn if we move up? Not exactly: at turn 4, we will be at y=2 (if we choose U at turn 3). Then we check freeway 2 at turn 4.\n\nSo we need to compute the car positions at future turns.\n\nWe'll plan a sequence:\n\nWe are at:\n  t=3: y=1\n\nWe want to get to y=9. The minimal number of turns is 6 if we move up every turn? Because from 1 to 9: 8 steps? Actually:\n\nAt turn 3: y=1\nTurn 4: y=2 (if U)\nTurn 5: y=3\nTurn 6: y=4\nTurn 7: y=5\nTurn 8: y=6\nTurn 9: y=7\nTurn 10: y=8\nTurn 11: y=9\n\nThat's 8 moves (from turn 3 to turn 11, 8 actions: t=3 to t=10). But note: we start at turn 3 and we take H actions? The problem says: a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} such that after H turns (i.e., at turn t1+H) we are at (0,9). Actually, the player update: at turn t, we take action a_t, and then we are at y_{t+1}. So:\n\nAt turn t1 (3), we are at y_3=1.\nAfter action a_3 (at turn 3), we get y_4.\nAfter action a_4 (at turn 4), we get y_5, and so on.\n\nWe want y_{3+H} = 9, and we take H actions: from t=3 to t=3+H-1.\n\nSo if we start at y_3=1, and we do U 8 times, then at turn 3+8 = 11, we will be at y_11=9. So H=8.\n\nBut we must avoid collisions at each turn. At each turn t, we are at y_t, and we must check the freeway y_t at turn t.\n\nSo for the plan to go from y=1 to y=2 at turn 4, then at turn 4 we are at y=2 and must check freeway 2 at turn 4.\n\nSimilarly, when we are at y=1 at turn 3, we check freeway 1 at turn 3 (safe).\n\nNow, let's check the freeways for the next turns if we go straight up.\n\nPlan: always U until we reach 9.\n\nTurn 3: y=1 -> safe (as above)\n\nTurn 4: y=2 -> check freeway 2 at turn 4.\n  Freeway 2: at turn 4 (T=4, so T-3=1): \n      car: [25 + 36*1, 60+36*1] = [61,96] -> 0 is not in [61,96] -> safe.\n\nTurn 5: y=3 -> freeway 3 at turn 5.\n  Freeway 3: same as freeway 2? Yes, same car: [25+36*(5-3)=25+72=97, 60+72=132] -> safe.\n\nTurn 6: y=4 -> freeway 4 at turn 6.\n  Freeway 4: same car: [25+36*(6-3)=25+108=133, 60+108=168] -> safe.\n\nTurn 7: y=5 -> freeway 5 at turn 7.\n  Freeway 5 has three cars at turn 7 (T=7, so T-3=4):\n    First car: [-59+6*4, -48+6*4] = [-59+24, -48+24] = [-35,-24] -> 0 not in [-35,-24] -> safe.\n    Second car: [19+6*4, 30+6*4] = [19+24,30+24]=[43,54] -> safe.\n    Third car: [-17+6*4, -6+6*4] = [-17+24, -6+24] = [7,18] -> 0 not in [7,18]? But 0 is not in [7,18] -> safe.\n\nTurn 8: y=6 -> freeway 6 at turn 8.\n  Freeway 6: same as freeway 5? Yes, same three cars? Actually, the table says freeway 6 has the same cars as freeway 5? \n      | 5 | ... and | 6 | same ... \n  So at turn 8 (T=8, T-3=5):\n    First car: [-59+6*5, -48+6*5] = [-59+30, -48+30] = [-29,-18] -> safe.\n    Second car: [19+30,30+30]=[49,60] -> safe.\n    Third car: [-17+30, -6+30]=[13,24] -> safe.\n\nTurn 9: y=7 -> freeway 7 at turn 9.\n  Freeway 7: one car: [-47+12*(9-3), -36+12*6] = [-47+72, -36+72] = [25,36] -> 0 not in [25,36] -> safe.\n\nTurn 10: y=8 -> freeway 8 at turn 10.\n  Freeway 8: [49+4*(10-3), 60+4*7] = [49+28,60+28]=[77,88] -> safe.\n\nTurn 11: y=9 -> we are at the goal. Note: at turn 11, we are at y=9, and there is no freeway at y=9 (since freeways are from 1 to 8). So no check needed? Actually, the problem says \"avoid collisions with cars on freeways y=1,...,8\". So at y=9, we are safe.\n\nTherefore, if we do U every turn from turn 3 to turn 10 (8 actions), we will be safe and reach y=9 at turn 11.\n\nBut wait: at turn 7, we were at freeway 5 and we saw the third car was at [7,18] at turn 7. The player is at (0,5) at turn 7? Actually, at turn 7, we are at y=5. The car on freeway 5 at turn 7: the third car is at [7,18]. The player is at x=0, which is in [7,18]? No, because 0 is less than 7? So 0 is not in the interval [7,18]. So safe.\n\nSimilarly, all others are safe.\n\nBut wait: at turn 7, the third car on freeway 5 is at [7,18]. The player is at (0,5) at turn 7. The collision condition: if 0 is in the car's span? 0 is not in [7,18] -> safe.\n\nSo the minimal H is 8? And the sequence is 8 U's.\n\nBut let me double-check the car on freeway 1 at turn 3: [1,24] -> 0 not in [1,24] -> safe.\n\nHowever, note the car on freeway 1: it is moving right at speed 24. At turn 3: [1,24]. At turn 4: [1+24=25, 24+24=48]. So at turn 3, the car is covering from 1 to 24. The player is at x=0, which is not covered. So safe.\n\nBut what if we consider that the car might have passed by? Actually, the car is at turn 3 at [1,24]. It's moving to the right, so in the past it was at negative positions? But we are at turn 3, and the car is at [1,24]. The player at x=0 is not in that span.\n\nSimilarly, all other freeways are safe.\n\nBut wait: freeway 5 at turn 7: the third car is at [7,18]. So at turn 7, the car covers from 7 to 18. The player is at 0, which is not in that interval.\n\nBut note: the first car on freeway 5 at turn 7: [-35,-24] -> 0 is not in that either.\n\nSo it seems safe.\n\nBut let me check if we can do it in fewer than 8 moves? We start at y=1, and we need to get to y=9: that's 8 steps. So 8 moves are minimal. So we don't need to consider a shorter path.\n\nBut what if we go faster? We can only move one step per turn. So 8 is the minimum.\n\nBut wait: what if we go down? That would make it longer. So we don't want that.\n\nSo the answer should be 8 consecutive U actions.\n\nBut let me write the actions:\n\nTurn 3: U -> to y=2 at turn 4\nTurn 4: U -> to y=3 at turn 5\nTurn 5: U -> to y=4 at turn 6\nTurn 6: U -> to y=5 at turn 7\nTurn 7: U -> to y=6 at turn 8\nTurn 8: U -> to y=7 at turn 9\nTurn 9: U -> to y=8 at turn 10\nTurn 10: U -> to y=9 at turn 11\n\nBut note: we are at turn 10, and we take the action U, and then at turn 11 we are at y=9. So we have taken 8 actions.\n\nBut the problem says: a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}. Here t1=3, so:\n\nt=0: a_{3+0}=a3\nt=1: a4\n...\nt=7: a10\n\nSo H=8.\n\nNow, we must write the answer:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 3: U\nTurn 4: U\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\n}\n\nBut wait: at turn 7, we are at y=5 and then we move to y=6. At turn 7, we are on freeway 5. We checked that at turn 7, the third car is at [7,18]. But note: what if the car covers 0 at turn 7? It doesn't.\n\nBut let me recheck freeway 5 at turn 7 (T=7, T-3=4):\n\nCar 1: [-59 + 6*4, -48+6*4] = [-59+24, -48+24] = [-35,-24] -> doesn't cover 0.\nCar 2: [19+24, 30+24] = [43,54] -> doesn't cover 0.\nCar 3: [-17+24, -6+24] = [7,18] -> doesn't cover 0.\n\nSo safe.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 8, freeway 6: same cars? Actually, freeway 6 has the same cars? The table says freeway 5 and 6 have the same set of cars? \n\nFreeway 5: three cars: (-48,-59,right,6), (30,19,right,6), (-6,-17,right,6)\nFreeway 6: same three cars? The table says the same: (-48,-59,right,6), (30,19,right,6), (-6,-17,right,6)\n\nSo at turn 8 (T=8, T-3=5):\nCar1: [-59+6*5, -48+6*5] = [-59+30, -48+30] = [-29,-18] -> safe.\nCar2: [19+30,30+30]=[49,60] -> safe.\nCar3: [-17+30, -6+30]=[13,24] -> safe.\n\nBut wait: at turn 8, we are at y=6. So we are checking freeway 6? Yes.\n\nBut note: at turn 7, we were on freeway 5, and at turn 8 we are on freeway 6. So we check freeway 5 at turn 7 and freeway 6 at turn 8.\n\nNow, what about freeway 8 at turn 10? We are at y=8 at turn 10: freeway 8: [49+4*(10-3)=49+28=77, 60+28=88] -> safe.\n\nSo it all checks.\n\nBut wait: what about freeway 7 at turn 9? We are at y=7 at turn 9: freeway 7: [-47+12*(9-3)= -47+72=25, -36+72=36] -> [25,36] -> safe.\n\nSo the plan is safe.\n\nTherefore, the minimal number of turns is 8, and the sequence is 8 U's.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H\", and we have H=8.\n\nBut let me consider if there is a problem at freeway 5 at turn 7. The third car is at [7,18] at turn 7. But note: the car is moving to the right. At turn 6, that car would be at [-17+6*(6-3)= -17+18=1, -6+18=12] -> [1,12] at turn 6. And at turn 7, [7,18]. The player is on freeway 5 at turn 7. But what if the player was on freeway 5 at turn 6? In our plan, at turn 6 we are at y=4 (freeway 4), and at turn 7 we move to y=5 (freeway 5) at turn 7. So we are only on freeway 5 at turn 7.\n\nSo we are safe.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me check if there is any car that would hit 0 at any turn from 3 to 10 on the freeways we are on:\n\nTurn 3: y=1 -> freeway1: [1,24] -> safe.\nTurn 4: y=2 -> freeway2: [25+36=61, 60+36=96] -> safe.\nTurn 5: y=3 -> freeway3: [25+36*2=97,60+72=132] -> safe.\nTurn 6: y=4 -> freeway4: [25+36*3=133,60+108=168] -> safe.\nTurn 7: y=5 -> freeway5: \n    car1: [-35,-24] -> safe.\n    car2: [43,54] -> safe.\n    car3: [7,18] -> safe (0 not in [7,18]).\nTurn 8: y=6 -> freeway6: same as freeway5 at turn 8? \n    car1: [-29,-18] -> safe.\n    car2: [49,60] -> safe.\n    car3: [13,24] -> safe.\nTurn 9: y=7 -> freeway7: [25,36] -> safe.\nTurn 10: y=8 -> freeway8: [77,88] -> safe.\n\nAll safe.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 8 consecutive U actions.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"avoid collisions with cars on freeways y=1,...,8\". And at the goal y=9, we don't check.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nTurn 3: U\nTurn 4: U\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\n\nWe write the answer accordingly.\n\nBut note: the answer format is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 3: U\nTurn 4: U\n...\nTurn 10: U\n}\n\nBut we must not include turn 11? Because we take 8 actions: from turn 3 to turn 10.\n\nSo we write 8 lines.\n\nBut the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and H=8, so t from 0 to 7, which corresponds to turns 3 to 10.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 3: U\nTurn 4: U\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\n}\n\nBut note: in the car state, freeway 5 and 6 have multiple cars. We checked and they are safe.\n\nOne more thing: the car on freeway 1 at turn 3: it's [1,24]. The player is at (0,1) at turn 3. The car is at positions 1 to 24. The player is at x=0, which is not in that span. So safe.\n\nBut what if the car was left-moving? Then the update would be different. But here all cars are right-moving? \n\nLooking at the table:\n\nFreeway 1: right\nFreeway 2: right\nFreeway 3: right\nFreeway 4: right\nFreeway 5: all cars right\nFreeway 6: all cars right\nFreeway 7: right\nFreeway 8: right\n\nSo all are right-moving. So the update is as we did.\n\nTherefore, the answer is as above.\n</think>\nThe goal is to reach position (0, 9) from (0, 1) at turn \\(t_1 = 3\\) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\). The player moves vertically by \\(+1\\) (U), \\(-1\\) (D), or \\(0\\) (S) per turn, with \\(y\\) constrained to \\([0, 9]\\).\n\n### Analysis:\n- **Starting Position**: At turn 3, the player is at \\(y = 1\\).\n- **Goal**: Reach \\(y = 9\\), requiring a minimum of 8 upward moves (since \\(9 - 1 = 8\\)).\n- **Car Collision Check**: At each turn \\(T\\), the player's position is \\((0, y_T)\\), and collision occurs if \\(0\\) is within the span of any car on freeway \\(y_T\\) at turn \\(T\\).

I need to get to (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing the y-position by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCollision happens only if at some turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T where for that freeway, there's a car such that 0 is in its span at that exact turn. The span changes over time based on the car's speed and direction.\n\nImportant note: when you move to a new freeway, you're not on that freeway until the next turn. So at turn T, if you move to y_{T+1}, you're still on y_T for collision purposes at turn T. Only at turn T+1 are you on y_{T+1}.\n\nI need to find a sequence of actions that gets me to y=9 quickly without being on a freeway when 0 is in a car's span on that freeway.\n\nFirst, let's list the car states for each freeway at turn t_1 = 4.\n\nFreeway 1: one car, head 48, tail 25, direction right, speed 24. Since it's right-moving, the span at time T is [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)] with t_1=4.\n\nDirection right: span at T is [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nDirection left: [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nFor freeway 1: head=48, tail=25, dir=right, speed=24. So at turn T, span = [25 + 24(T-4), 48 + 24(T-4)]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nCollision if 0 is in the span for that freeway at turn T when player is on it.\n\nPlayer is on freeway y at turn T if y_T = y.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=2 to y=9. Since moving up is faster, I should try to go up as much as possible, but avoid the freeways when cars are at x=0.\n\nx=0 is the point where collision happens.\n\nFor each freeway, I need to find when 0 is in the car's span, meaning for some car on that row, 0 is between the tail and head at that turn.\n\nSince multiple cars per freeway, I need to check all for each row.\n\nLet me list for each freeway the cars and their span equations over time.\n\nDefine t = T - t_1, so at t=0, it's turn t_1=4.\n\nSet τ = T - t_1, so τ is the offset from current turn.\n\nAt τ = 0, current state.\n\nFor freeway 1: car: tail=25, head=48, dir=right, speed=24\n\nSpan at τ: [25 + 24τ, 48 + 24τ]\n\n0 in span if 25 + 24τ ≤ 0 ≤ 48 + 24τ\n\nBut 25 + 24τ is increasing, and for τ=0, 25 to 48, both positive, 0 not in [25,48]. As τ increases, it moves right, so 0 is always left of the span since min is 25+24τ >0 for τ≥0. So never collision on freeway 1. 25+24τ ≥25>0, so 0 < min, so not in span. Good, freeway 1 is always safe.\n\nFreeway 2: cars: one car, head=-48? Tail=-83, head=-48? That seems odd. Head and tail, and direction right.\n\nTail=-83, head=-48, dir=right, speed=36.\n\nSince dir=right, span at τ: [τ + s τ, h + s τ] with s=36, τ=tail, h=head.\n\nτ = -83, h = -48\n\nSo span = [-83 + 36τ, -48 + 36τ] for τ = T - t_1\n\n0 in span if -83 + 36τ ≤ 0 ≤ -48 + 36τ\n\nSolve inequalities.\n\nLeft: -83 + 36τ ≤ 0 → 36τ ≤ 83 → τ ≤ 83/36 ≈ 2.305\n\nRight: 0 ≤ -48 + 36τ → 48 ≤ 36τ → τ ≥ 48/36 = 4/3 ≈ 1.333\n\nSo for τ between 1.333 and 2.305, 0 in span.\n\nSince τ integer (turns), τ from ceil(1.333) to floor(2.305), so τ=2 only? τ min 1.333, ceil to 2? τ must be integer.\n\nτ ≥ 1.333, so τ ≥ 2 since τ integer? τ min is ceil(1.333) = 2?

Tail=-11, head=0, dir=right.\n\nSpan: [-11 + 6τ, 0 + 6τ] = [-11 + 6τ, 6τ]\n\n0 in span if -11 + 6τ ≤ 0 ≤ 6τ\n\nLeft: -11 + 6τ ≤ 0 → 6τ ≤ 11 → τ ≤ 11/6 ≈ 1.833\n\nRight: 0 ≤ 6τ always true for τ≥0.\n\nSo τ ≤ 1.833, and τ≥0, so τ=0,1\n\nAt τ=0: span [-11,0], 0 is included? Head=0, tail=-11, so [ -11, 0 ] includes 0.\n\nSimilarly at τ=1: [-11+6, 0+6] = [-5,6], includes 0.\n\nAt τ=2: [-11+12,12] = [1,12], 0 not in [1,12], so not.\n\nSo for third car, collision at τ=0 and τ=1, which is turn T=4 and T=5.\n\nNow for freeway 5, we need to check all cars.\n\n- First car: collision at τ=7,8\n\n- Second car: no collision\n\n- Third car: collision at τ=0,1\n\nSo overall, freeway 5 has collision when any car has 0 in span.\n\nAt τ=0: third car has collision\n\nτ=1: third car has collision\n\nτ=7: first car has collision\n\nτ=8: first car has collision\n\nAnd other times no collision.\n\nSpecifically, at τ=0 (turn 4), collision; τ=1 (turn 5), collision; τ=7 (turn 11), τ=8 (turn 12), etc.\n\nBut since we start from turn 4, and we might not be there at later times, but for now.\n\nNow freeway 6: same as freeway 5? \"Freeway 6 | (-42, -53, right, 6), (36, 25, right, 6), (0, -11, right, 6)\" identical to freeway 5.\n\nSo same collision times: at τ=0,1,7,8,... but τ=0 and 1 are turns 4 and 5.\n\nNow freeway 7: one car, head=-24? Tail=-35, head=-24? Head and tail, direction right.\n\nTail=-35, head=-24, dir=right, speed=12\n\nSpan: [-35 + 12τ, -24 + 12τ]\n\n0 in span if -35 + 12τ ≤ 0 ≤ -24 + 12τ\n\nLeft: -35 + 12τ ≤ 0 → 12τ ≤ 35 → τ ≤ 35/12 ≈ 2.916\n\nRight: 0 ≤ -24 + 12τ → 24 ≤ 12τ → τ ≥ 2\n\nSo τ from 2 to 2.916, so τ=2 only? τ=2: 2≥2 and 2≤2.916, yes\n\nτ=3: 3>2.916? 2.916, 3>2.916, not ≤, so only τ=2.\n\nAt τ=2, span [-35+24, -24+24] = [-11,0], which includes 0.\n\nSo collision at τ=2, turn T=6.\n\nFreeway 8: one car, tail=-48? Head=-59? Tail=-59, head=-48? Direction right, speed=4.\n\nTail=-59, head=-48, dir=right, speed=4\n\nSpan: [-59 + 4τ, -48 + 4τ]\n\n0 in span if -59 + 4τ ≤ 0 ≤ -48 + 4τ\n\nLeft: -59 + 4τ ≤ 0 → 4τ ≤ 59 → τ ≤ 59/4 = 14.75\n\nRight: 0 ≤ -48 + 4τ → 48 ≤ 4τ → τ ≥ 12\n\nSo τ from 12 to 14.75, so τ=12,13,14\n\nCollision at those times, which are later, turns 4+12=16, etc., might not be relevant if we move fast.\n\nNow, freeway 1 we said always safe, no collision.\n\nPlayer starts at y=2 at turn t=4.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nThe freeways are y=1 to y=8, and we need to avoid being on a freeway when it has collision for that turn.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are not freeways, I think, no cars, so safe.\n\nThe grid has y=0 to 9, freeways y=1 to 8 have cars.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nPlayer starts at (0,2), which is on freeway y=2? Freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=2 is freeway 2.\n\nAt turn t=4, player is on y=2.\n\nNow, for freeway 2, at τ=0 (turn 4), is there collision? Earlier for freeway 2, we had collision only at τ=2, turn 6.\n\nAt τ=0, freeway 2: car span [-83, -48]? At τ=0: [-83 + 0, -48 + 0] = [-83, -48], 0 not in, since -48 <0? -48 to -83, both negative, 0 not in, so no collision at turn 4 on freeway 2.\n\nSimilarly, for other freeways.\n\nBut at turn 4, player is on y=2, freeway 2, which is safe at τ=0.\n\nNow, we need to go to y=9.\n\nThe minimal H would be if we go up every turn, from y=2 to y=9, need 7 moves up, so H=7 turns? But we might need to avoid some freeways at certain times.\n\nActions: from turn t1 to t1+H-1, so H actions.\n\nStart at y_{t1} =2, after H actions, y_{t1 + H} =9? Let's see the indices.\n\nAt turn t, we are at position for that turn.\n\nAfter action a_t, we move to y_{t+1}.\n\nSo at turn t1=4, we are at y=2.\n\nWe take action a_t for t from t1 to t1+H-1, so H actions, to reach at turn t1 + H, we are at y=9.\n\nAfter H actions, we have done t1 to t1+H-1, so at turn (t1+H), we are at y=9.\n\nAnd we need to be at y=9 at some turn.\n\nThe position after H actions is at turn t1 + H.\n\nSet t = turn number.\n\nAt t=4, y=2.\n\nWe take action a_4, a_5, ..., up to a_{4 + H -1}, and at turn t=4 + H, y=9.\n\nFor each turn from t=4 to t=4+H-1, we are on some y, and must not collide, meaning for that turn and y, 0 not in car span on that freeway.\n\nAt turn t, we are on y_t, and for freeway k=y_t, we need that at turn t, for that k, no car has 0 in span.\n\nNow, to minimize H, so from y=2 to y=9, minimum moves up is 7, but we might need to stay or move down to avoid collisions, which could increase H.\n\nBut let's see if we can go up directly.\n\nStart at t=4, y=2.\n\nFreeway 2 is safe at t=4, as we saw.\n\nTake action U to go to y=3 at next turn.\n\nAction a_t determines y_{t+1}.\n\nAt turn t, after action, y_{t+1} is set.\n\nBut at turn t, we are on y_t.\n\nSo for collision at turn t, it depends on y_t and the cars at that time.\n\nNow, sequence:\n\nAt turn 4: position y=2, freeway 2.\n\nFreeway 2 at t=4 (τ=0): span [-83,-48], 0 not in, safe.\n\nWe take action a_4, which affects y_5.\n\nSuppose we take U, so y_5 = y_4 +1 = 3.\n\nNow at turn 5: position y=3, freeway 3.\n\nFreeway 3 at t=5: t=5, τ= t - t1 = t -4, so at t=5, τ=1.\n\nFreeway 3: same as freeway 2, car span at τ: [-83 +36τ, -48 +36τ]\n\nAt τ=1: [-83+36, -48+36] = [-47, -12], both negative, 0 not in, so safe.\n\nThen take U, y_6 =4.\n\nAt turn 6: y=4, freeway 4.\n\nFreeway 4 at t=6: τ=2 (since t=6, t1=4, τ=2)\n\nFreeway 4: car, at τ=2, span [-83+72, -48+72] = [-11,24], 0 is between -11 and 24, so collision! Oh, at turn 6, on freeway 4, collision.\n\nSo we cannot be on freeway 4 at turn 6.\n\nBut if we go up directly, at turn 6 we are on y=4, which is freeway 4, and collision.\n\nSo need to avoid that.\n\nWe could stay or move down to avoid being on y=4 at turn 6.\n\nOr move faster or slower.\n\nSince we start at y=2, and need to go to y=9, we have to pass through the freeways.\n\nFreeway 4 at turn 6 is dangerous.\n\nTurn 6 is when τ=2 for freeways 2,3,4 all dangerous, but freeway 4 at τ=2 collision.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2 and 3 at τ=2 also collision, but at different turns.\n\nAt turn 6, τ=2, freeway 2: at τ=2, collision, freeway 3: collision, freeway 4: collision.\n\nAlso freeway 7 at τ=2 collision? Freeway 7 at τ=2 collision.\n\nBut we are not necessarily on them.\n\nFor the path, if we go up directly, at turn 6 we are on y=4, which is bad.\n\nSo we need to not be on freeways 2,3,4 at turn 6? Freeways 2,3,4 all have collision at turn 6.\n\nFreeway 2 at turn 6: τ=2, collision\n\nFreeway 3 at turn 6: τ=2, collision\n\nFreeway 4 at turn 6: τ=2, collision\n\nAlso freeway 7 at turn 6: τ=2, collision.\n\nBut freeway 7 is y=7.\n\nNow, what about other freeways.\n\nWe also have to consider freeways 5 and 6, which have collisions at τ=0 and τ=1, which are turns 4 and 5.\n\nAt turn 4: freeway 5 and 6 have collision because of the third car, span includes 0.\n\nAt turn 4, τ=0, freeway 5: third car span [-11,0], includes 0.\n\nSimilarly freeway 6 same.\n\nSo at turn 4, if on freeway 5 or 6, collision.\n\nBut at turn 4, player is on y=2, freeway 2, which is safe, as we saw.\n\nAt turn 5, τ=1, freeway 5 and 6 have collision because third car span at τ=1: [-11+6,6] = [-5,6], includes 0.\n\nSo freeway 5 and 6 dangerous at turns 4 and 5.\n\nBut at turn 5, if we are on y=3, freeway 3, which at τ=1 is safe, as we saw earlier.\n\nNow back to the direct path issue.\n\nTo avoid being on y=4 at turn 6, we could:\n\n- Stay at y=3 for turn 6, so at turn 6 we are on y=3.\n\nOr move down to y=2, but y=2 at turn 6 is freeway 2, which has collision at turn 6.\n\nSimilarly, y=3 at turn 6: freeway 3, at τ=2, collision.\n\ny=4 at turn 6 collision.\n\ny=5 at turn 6: freeway 5, at τ=2 (t=6, τ=2), freeway 5 at τ=2: is there collision?\n\nFreeway 5: cars, at τ=2.\n\nFirst car: span [-53+12, -42+12] = [-41,-30], 0 not in\n\nSecond car: [25+12,36+12]=[37,48], 0 not in\n\nThird car: [-11+12, 12]= [1,12], 0 not in\n\nSo at τ=2, freeway 5 is safe.\n\nSimilarly freeway 6 same.\n\ny=6 at turn 6: freeway 6, same as above, safe.\n\ny=7 at turn 6: freeway 7, at τ=2, collision, as we saw.\n\ny=8 at turn 6: freeway 8, at τ=2, span [-59+8, -48+8] = [-51,-40], 0 not in, safe.\n\ny=1 at turn 6: freeway 1, always safe.\n\ny=0 or y=9 safe.\n\nSo at turn 6, dangerous freeways: y=2,3,4,7\n\nSafe: y=1,5,6,8, and y=0,9.\n\nNow, for our path, from y=2 at t=4.\n\nIf we go up to y=3 at t=5.\n\nAt t=5, y=3, freeway 3, τ=1, safe as before.\n\nThen at turn 6, we need to not be on y=3 or y=4, etc.\n\nOptions:\n\n- From y=3 at t=5, take S (stay), so y_6 =3, but at t=6 on y=3, collision.\n\n- Take U to y_6=4, collision at t=6.\n\n- Take D to y_6=2, but at t=6 on y=2, collision.\n\nAll bad.\n\nSo we cannot be on y=3 at t=5 if we then go to turn 6, because from there all moves lead to collision at t=6 for y=2,3,4.\n\nBut we can be on other y at t=5.\n\nAt t=4, we are at y=2.\n\nWe take action a_4.\n\na_4 can be U, D, or S.\n\nIf U, y_5=3, as above, then stuck for t=6.\n\nIf S, y_5=2, so at t=5, on y=2.\n\nFreeway 2 at t=5: τ=1, span [-83+36, -48+36] = [-47,-12], 0 not in, safe.\n\nThen at t=5, we take action for y_6.\n\nBut at t=6, y=2 is dangerous, so we need to move away.\n\nIf we take U from y=2 to y=3, but at t=6 on y=3, collision.\n\nTake D to y=1, freeway 1.\n\nFreeway 1 at t=6: τ=2, span [25+48, 48+48]? At τ=2, [25+24*2, 48+24*2] = [25+48,48+48]=[73,96], 0 not in, safe.\n\ny=1 is freeway 1, always safe.\n\nTake S to y=2, collision at t=6.\n\nSo from t=5 at y=2, we can take D to y_6=1, so at t=6 on y=1, safe.\n\nThen from there, we need to go up to y=9.\n\nBut we lost time by moving down.\n\nIf at t=4 we take D to y=1.\n\nAt t=4, take a_4 = D, so y_5 = 2 + (-1) =1? y_t is position at turn t.\n\nAt turn t=4, y_4=2.\n\nTake a_4 = D, so y_5 = y_4 + (-1) =1.\n\nThen at turn t=5, position y=1, freeway 1.\n\nFreeway 1 at t=5: τ=1, span [25+24,48+24]=[49,72], safe.\n\nThen at t=5, we can take U to y_6=2, but at t=6, y=2 is dangerous.\n\nTake S to y_6=1, safe, but not progress.\n\nTake D to y_6=0, but y=0 is not freeway, safe, but below.\n\nThen from y=0, we can go up, but slow.\n\nNot efficient.\n\nPerhaps we can go to a safe row at turn 6.\n\nAt turn 6, safe rows: y=1,5,6,8.\n\ny=1 is always safe.\n\ny=5 and 6 safe at τ=2.\n\ny=8 safe.\n\nNow, at turn 4, we are at y=2.\n\nWe need to be at one of y=1,5,6,8 at turn 6.\n\nBut turn 6 is two steps from now.\n\nAt turn 4: y=2\n\nAfter one action, at turn 5: y can be 1,2,3\n\nThen after second action, at turn 6: from y=1, can go to y=0,1,2; from y=2, to y=1,2,3; from y=3, to y=2,3,4.\n\nBut we want at turn 6 to be on y=1,5,6,8.\n\ny=5,6,8 are higher, from y=3 at turn 5, we can go to y=4, but y=4 at turn 6 is dangerous, or to y=3 or 2, dangerous.\n\nFrom y=2 at turn 5, to y=1,2,3; y=1 safe at turn 6, y=2 and 3 dangerous.\n\nFrom y=1 at turn 5, to y=0,1,2; y=0 and 1 safe at turn 6, y=2 dangerous.\n\nBut y=5,6,8 not reachable from here in one step from turn 5 positions.\n\nAt turn 5, y can be 1,2,3.\n\nFrom y=3, y_6 can be 2,3,4 all dangerous except if we could go to higher, but no, only to 4.\n\ny=4 is dangerous.\n\nSimilarly, from y=2, to y=1,2,3; y=1 safe, others dangerous.\n\nFrom y=1, to y=0,1,2; y=0 and 1 safe.\n\nSo at turn 6, we can only be on y=0,1 safely, or if we move, but y=5,6,8 are too far.\n\nFor example, to reach y=5 at turn 6 from y=2 at turn 4, need to move up 3 steps in 2 turns, impossible since max up per turn is 1.\n\nSimilarly, y=6 or 8 even farther.\n\nSo at turn 6, we can only be on y=0 or 1 safely, or possibly y=9 but not reachable.\n\ny=9 not reachable yet.\n\nSo for turn 6, we must be on y=0 or y=1 to avoid collision.\n\nThen from there, we can proceed to higher.\n\nBut being on y=0 or 1 at turn 6 might delay reaching y=9.\n\nFirst, let's get to turn 6 safely.\n\nAt t=4, y=2.\n\nWe need to be at y=1 or 0 at t=6.\n\nOptions:\n\n- At t=4, take U to y_5=3.\n\nThen at t=5, y=3, we must go down to y_6=2 or lower, but y=2 at t=6 collision, y=3 collision, y=4 collision. If we take D to y_6=2, collision; to y_6=3 or 4, collision. No safe way from y=3 at t=5 to be safe at t=6.\n\nIf at t=4 take S, y_5=2.\n\nAt t=5, y=2, then take D to y_6=1, so at t=6 on y=1, safe.\n\nTake S to y_6=2, collision; take U to y_6=3, collision.\n\nSo only take D to y=1.\n\nIf at t=4 take D, y_5=1.\n\nAt t=5, y=1, then take S to y_6=1, safe; or take D to y_6=0, safe; or take U to y_6=2, but y=2 at t=6 collision, so not U.\n\nSo can stay or go down.\n\nBut to minimize time, probably stay or go to y=1.\n\nSo safest: from t=4, take S or D to be at y=1 or 2 at t=5, but at t=5 y=2 is safe, as we saw.\n\nThen from t=5, take D to y_6=1.\n\nOr from t=4 take D to y_5=1, then at t=5 take S to y_6=1.\n\nEither way, we can be at y=1 at turn 6.\n\nNow from there, we need to go up to y=9.\n\nBut we have freeways above.\n\nNow, turn 6 safe.\n\nAt turn 6, y=1, safe.\n\nTake action a_6 for y_7.\n\nWe can take U to y_7=2.\n\nBut at turn 7, what is the state?\n\nWe need to know for each freeway at future turns.\n\nAlso, freeways 5 and 6 have collisions at later times, like τ=7,8, but τ=7 is t=11, which might be late.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8 at τ=12,13,14, late.\n\nBut also, we need to avoid freeways 5 and 6 at turns where they have early collisions, but turns 4 and 5 are past, so for t>5, freeway 5 and 6 are safe except at τ=7,8, etc.\n\nτ=0,1 past.\n\nAt τ=2, t=6, freeway 5 and 6 safe, as we saw.\n\nNow, at turn 7: t=7, τ=3.\n\nFreeway 5 at τ=3: first car span [-53+18, -42+18]=[-35,-24], 0 not in\n\nSecond car [25+18,36+18]=[43,54], 0 not in\n\nThird car [-11+18,18]=[7,18], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly freeway 6 safe.\n\nFreeway 7 at τ=3: span [-35+36, -24+36]? Freeway 7 car: tail=-35, head=-24, speed=12, at τ=3: [-35+36, -24+36]= [1,12], 0 not in, safe. (since -35+12*3= -35+36=1, -24+36=12)\n\nFreeway 8 at τ=3: [-59+12, -48+12]=[-47,-36], safe.\n\nFreeway 1 always safe.\n\nFreeway 2 at τ=3: span [-83+108, -48+108]= [25,60], 0 not in, safe? τ=3, [-83+36*3, -48+36*3]= [-83+108, -48+108]= [25,60], yes safe.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nSo at turn 7, all freeways are safe, I think.\n\nBut we need to check if any has collision at τ=3.\n\nFreeway 5,6,7,8 all safe as above.\n\nFreeway 2,3,4: at τ=3, for example freeway 2: [-83+108, -48+108]=[25,60]>0, safe; similarly 3 and 4.\n\nSo yes, at turn 7, all y safe.\n\nSimilarly for later turns until τ=7 or so.\n\nNow back to the plan.\n\nAt turn 6, we are at y=1.\n\nTake U to y_7=2.\n\nAt turn 7, y=2, freeway 2, at τ=3, safe as above.\n\nThen take U to y_8=3.\n\nAt turn 8, y=3, freeway 3, τ=4, span [-83+144, -48+144]= [61,96], safe.\n\nTake U to y_9=4.\n\nAt turn 9, y=4, freeway 4, τ=5, span [-83+180, -48+180]= [97,132], safe.\n\nTake U to y_10=5.\n\nAt turn 10, y=5, freeway 5, τ=6.\n\nFreeway 5 at τ=6: first car [-53+36, -42+36]=[-17,-6], 0 not in? -17 to -6, both negative, 0 not in.\n\nSecond car [25+36,36+36]=[61,72], safe.\n\nThird car [-11+36,36]=[25,36], safe. So freeway 5 safe.\n\nTake U to y_11=6.\n\nAt turn 11, y=6, freeway 6, τ=7.\n\nFreeway 6 at τ=7: first car [-53+42, -42+42]=[-11,0], -53 +6*7= -53+42= -11, -42+42=0, so span [-11,0], includes 0, collision!\n\nOh, at τ=7, freeway 5 and 6 have collision from first car.\n\nFor freeway 5, first car at τ=7: span [-53 +6*7, -42 +6*7] = [-53+42, -42+42] = [-11,0], includes 0.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 6 same.\n\nSo at turn t= t1 + τ =4+7=11, on freeway 5 or 6, collision.\n\nIn this case, at turn 11, if on y=5 or 6, collision.\n\nIn our path, at turn 11, we are on y=6 if we go up.\n\nBut we can avoid.\n\nIn the sequence above, at turn 10, we are at y=5.\n\nThen if we take U to y_11=6, at turn 11 on y=6, collision.\n\nTake S to y_11=5, at turn 11 on y=5, collision as well.\n\nTake D to y_11=4, at turn 11 on y=4, freeway 4, τ=7, span [-83+36*7, -48+36*7]= [-83+252, -48+252]= [169,204], safe? But we are at y=4, which is safe, but we need to go up.\n\nBut we can do that to avoid.\n\nBut let's see the timing.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nFirst, let's list the dangerous turns for each freeway.\n\nSummarize collision times:\n\n- Freeway 1: never\n\n- Freeway 2: only at τ=2, t=6\n\n- Freeway 3: only at τ=2, t=6\n\n- Freeway 4: only at τ=2, t=6\n\n- Freeway 5: collision at τ=0,1,7,8 (t=4,5,11,12)\n\n- Freeway 6: same as 5, τ=0,1,7,8 (t=4,5,11,12)\n\n- Freeway 7: only at τ=2, t=6\n\n- Freeway 8: collision at τ=12,13,14 (t=16,17,18)\n\nFor freeway 8, τ=12,13,14, which is later.\n\nNow, t=4 and 5 are past or current, but at t=4 we are on y=2 safe, t=5 we can be safe if not on y=5 or 6.\n\nDangerous turns: t=6 for y=2,3,4,7\n\nt=11 and 12 for y=5 and 6\n\nt=16,17,18 for y=8, but that might be late.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 quickly.\n\nMinimal H: from y=2 to y=9, 7 steps up, so 7 actions, from t=4 to t=10? Let's index.\n\nAt t=4, y=2.\n\nAfter 0 actions, at t=4.\n\nAfter 1 action, t=5, y=?\n\n...\n\nAfter k actions, at t=4+k.\n\nWe need y_{4+H} =9 after H actions.\n\nActions at t=4 to 4+H-1, position at t=4+H is 9.\n\nFor example, if all U, start at t=4 y=2, after a4 U, t=5 y=3; a5 U, t=6 y=4; but at t=6 y=4 collision, not possible.\n\na5 U, t=6 y=4, but collision, so not.\n\nTo avoid t=6, we need to be at safe y at t=6.\n\nAs before, only y=0 or 1 safe at t=6.\n\nSuppose we go to y=1 at t=6.\n\nHow to get there.\n\nFrom t=4 y=2, take D at t=4, so y5=1.\n\nThen at t=5, y=1, take S or D.\n\nIf take S, y6=1.\n\nThen at t=6, y=1, safe.\n\nNow from here, we can go up.\n\nBut at t=6, y=1.\n\nTake U to y7=2.\n\nt=7, y=2, safe as earlier.\n\nTake U to y8=3, t=8 y=3 safe.\n\nU to y9=4, t=9 y=4.\n\nFreeway 4 at t=9, τ=5, safe.\n\nU to y10=5, t=10 y=5.\n\nFreeway 5 at t=10, τ=6.\n\nτ=6, t=10, τ= t - t1 = t-4.\n\nt=10, τ=6.\n\nFreeway 5 at τ=6: first car [-53+36, -42+36]=[-17,-6], 0 not in; second car [61,72]; third [25,36]; all safe, no 0.\n\nThen take U to y11=6, t=11 y=6.\n\nBut at t=11, τ=7, freeway 6 (since y=6) at τ=7: first car [-53+42, -42+42]=[-11,0], includes 0, collision.\n\nProblem.\n\nAt t=11, if on y=5 or 6, collision.\n\nSo at t=11, we cannot be on y=5 or 6.\n\nSimilarly, at t=12, same for y=5 and 6.\n\nNow, at t=10, we are at y=5.\n\nFrom there, if we take U to y11=6, collision at t=11.\n\nTake S to y11=5, at t=11 on y=5, collision.\n\nTake D to y11=4, at t=11 on y=4, freeway 4, τ=7, span [-83+252, -48+252]= [169,204], safe, but we are at y=4, which is lower.\n\nThen we need to go up again, which takes more turns.\n\nTo reach y=9 faster, we need to avoid being on y=5 or 6 at t=11 and t=12.\n\nt=11 and 12 are dangerous for y=5 and 6.\n\nSince we are going up, we might be able to pass through before or after.\n\nFor example, if we can be on y=5 before t=11 or after t=12.\n\nBut t=11 is τ=7, and the first collision at τ=7 for freeway 5 and 6.\n\nAlso at τ=8, t=12.\n\nSo dangerous t=11 and 12.\n\nIf we are on y=5 at t=10, which is safe, as above.\n\nThen at t=10, we need to not be on y=5 or 6 at t=11.\n\nSo from y=5 at t=10, we can take U to y11=6, but collision at t=11.\n\nTake S to y11=5, collision.\n\nTake D to y11=4, safe, but then we are at y=4 at t=11.\n\nThen from there, we can go up later.\n\nBut let's see the time to y=9.\n\nFirst, from the beginning, let's plan to avoid the dangerous times.\n\nStart at t=4, y=2.\n\nTo avoid t=6 collision, we go to y=1 at t=6.\n\nAs before: a4 = D, so y5=1 (from y2 down to y1)\n\ny4=2, a4=D, y5=1.\n\nThen a5=S, y6=1. (at t=6, y=1)\n\nNow at t=6, y=1.\n\nTake a6=U, y7=2.\n\nt=7, y=2, safe.\n\na7=U, y8=3.\n\nt=8, y=3, safe.\n\na8=U, y9=4.\n\nt=9, y=4, safe.\n\na9=U, y10=5.\n\nt=10, y=5, freeway 5, τ=6, safe as above.\n\nNow at t=10, y=5.\n\nWe cannot go to y=6 at t=11 because collision.\n\nSo take a10 = S, but if a10=S, y11=5, at t=11 on y=5, collision.\n\nNot good.\n\nTake a10 = D, y11=4, at t=11 on y=4, safe.\n\nThen at t=11, y=4.\n\nTake a11=U, y12=5.\n\nBut at t=12, y=5, freeway 5, τ=8, collision? τ=8, t=12.\n\nFreeway 5 at τ=8: first car [-53+48, -42+48]=[-5,6], includes 0; so collision at t=12 on y=5.\n\nIf we go to y=5 at t=12, collision.\n\nTake a10 = D to y11=4.\n\nThen at t=11, y=4, safe.\n\nThen take a11=U to y12=5, but at t=12 on y=5, τ=8, collision.\n\nTake a11=S, y12=4, safe but not progress.\n\nOr take a11=D to y12=3, worse.\n\nSo stuck.\n\nFrom t=10 y=5, take U to y11=6, but at t=11 on y=6, collision same as y=5.\n\nNot good.\n\nWe need to be past y=6 by t=11 or before t=11.\n\nFor example, if we can be on y=6 at t=10 or earlier.\n\nt=10 is τ=6, freeway 6 at τ=6: first car [-53+36, -42+36]=[-17,-6], 0 not in; second [61,72]; third [25,36]; safe.\n\nBut to be on y=6 at t=10, we need to have moved faster.\n\nFrom start, we are slow because we went down to y=1 at t=6.\n\nAt t=6 y=1, t=7 y=2, t=8 y=3, t=9 y=4, t=10 y=5.\n\nTo be at y=6 at t=10, from t=6 y=1, in 4 turns to t=10, we can go up 4 times, to y=5 at t=10, as above, not to y=6.\n\nMax from y=1 at t=6, after 4 actions to t=10, y can be up to 5 if all U.\n\ny at t=6 is 1, after a6 to a9, 4 actions, at t=10 y=1 + number of U.\n\nIf all U, y10=5.\n\nCannot be y=6 at t=10.\n\nSimilarly, to be on y=7 or higher at t=11 to avoid y=5,6.\n\nAt t=11, if on y=7 or 8 or 9, safe, since y=7 at t=11: freeway 7 at τ=7, span [-35+84, -24+84]= [49,60], safe? τ=7, t=11, freeway 7 car: tail=-35, head=-24, speed=12, span at τ: [-35+12τ, -24+12τ]\n\nAt τ=7: [-35+84, -24+84]= [49,60], safe.\n\nFreeway 8 at τ=7: [-59+28, -48+28]=[-31,-20], safe.\n\ny=9 safe.\n\nSo if we can be at y=7 or higher at t=11, safe.\n\nBut from our path, at t=10 we are at y=5, so at t=11 we can be at y=6 at best, which is dangerous.\n\nWe need to be higher earlier.\n\nBut at t=6 we are at y=1, which is low.\n\nSo we lost time by going down.\n\nPerhaps we can avoid going down at the beginning.\n\nAnother idea: at turn 4, instead of going down, we go up but skip the dangerous turn 6.\n\nFor example, at t=4, y=2, take U to y5=3.\n\nAt t=5, y=3, safe.\n\nThen at t=5, instead of going to y=4 at t=6, we can go down or stay, but all lead to dangerous y at t=6.\n\nUnless we go to a safe y at t=6, but from y=3, we can only go to y=2,3,4, all dangerous at t=6.\n\nSo impossible to be safe at t=6 from there.\n\nWe must be at y=0 or 1 at t=6.\n\ny=0 is also possible.\n\nAt t=4, take D to y5=1.\n\nThen at t=5, take D to y6=0.\n\nAt t=6, y=0, safe, no freeway.\n\nThen from there, go up.\n\nBut similar issue with later times.\n\nTo reach higher faster, we need to not waste turns.\n\nPerhaps we can be on y=5 or 6 at an earlier time, before t=11.\n\nFor example, if we can be on y=6 at t=10, which is safe, then at t=11, we can be on y=7, which is safe.\n\nBut from start, at t=4 y=2, to be at y=6 at t=10, that's 6 steps in 6 turns? From t=4 to t=10, that's 6 turns later, positions from t=4 to t=10.\n\nAt t=4, y=2.\n\nAfter 6 actions, at t=10, y can be from 2-6 to 2+6, so y=6 is possible if all U.\n\nBut we have to avoid t=6 danger.\n\nLet's try all up from t=4.\n\na4=U, y5=3 at t=5.\n\nt=5 y=3 safe.\n\na5=U, y6=4 at t=6, but collision at t=6 on y=4.\n\nNot possible.\n\nSo we must deviate.\n\nSuppose at t=4, take S, y5=2.\n\na5=D, y6=1 at t=6.\n\nThen from t=6 y=1, we can go all U.\n\na6=U, y7=2 at t=7.\n\na7=U, y8=3 at t=8.\n\na8=U, y9=4 at t=9.\n\na9=U, y10=5 at t=10.\n\na10=U, y11=6 at t=11, but at t=11 on y=6, collision.\n\nSame problem.\n\nAt t=10 y=5, we can take U to y11=6, collision.\n\nBut if we take no action or down, we stay or go down.\n\nTo be at y=7 at t=11, from t=6 y=1, in 5 actions to t=11, we can go up 5 times, to y=6 at t=11, but y=6 at t=11 collision.\n\nMax y at t=11 from y=1 at t=6 is 6, which is dangerous.\n\nCannot reach y=7 at t=11 from there.\n\ny at t=6 is 1, after 5 actions (a6 to a10), at t=11, y=1 + net up.\n\nIf all U, y11=6.\n\nIf we go faster earlier, but we are constrained by t=6.\n\nAnother idea: at t=4, take U to y5=3.\n\nThen at t=5, take S to y6=3, but at t=6 on y=3 collision.\n\nNot good.\n\nOr take D to y6=2, collision.\n\nNo.\n\nPerhaps we can go to y=5 or 6 at t=5, but t=5 is τ=1, freeway 5 and 6 have collision at τ=1.\n\nAt t=5, if on y=5 or 6, collision.\n\nFor example, from t=4 y=2, take U to y5=3, not on y=5.\n\nTo be on y=5 at t=5, from y=2 at t=4, need to go up 3 steps in one turn, impossible.\n\nSo cannot be on high y at early turns.\n\nSo the only way is to be at y=1 or 0 at t=6, then go up, but then we hit the t=11 problem.\n\nTo avoid t=11, we can be on y=5 or 6 before t=11 or after t=12.\n\nAfter t=12, at t=13, freeway 5 at τ=9: first car [-53+54, -42+54]=[1,12], 0 not in, safe; similarly.\n\nBut t=13 is late.\n\nBefore t=11, like at t=10, on y=6 is safe.\n\nBut to be on y=6 at t=10, from start.\n\nAt t=4 y=2.\n\nTo be at y=6 at t=10, that's 4 steps up in 6 turns, so possible with some stays, but we need to avoid t=6.\n\nLet's find a sequence.\n\nAt t=4, y=2.\n\nTake a4=U, y5=3.\n\nt=5, y=3, safe.\n\nBut then at t=6, we need to not be on y=2,3,4,7.\n\nFrom y=3, we can only go to y=2,3,4, all dangerous.\n\nSo we must not be at y=3 at t=5 if we can't escape t=6.\n\nUnless we are at y=5 or 6 at t=6, but at t=6, y=5 and 6 are safe, as we saw earlier.\n\nAt t=6, τ=2, freeway 5 and 6 are safe.\n\nYes!\n\nAt t=6, y=5 and 6 are safe.\n\nAlso y=1 and 8 safe.\n\nBut y=5 and 6 are safe at t=6.\n\nSo if we can be on y=5 or 6 at t=6, that would be good, and we can avoid the t=11 collision by being higher later.\n\nBut at t=6, y=5 or 6 is safe.\n\nFrom t=4 y=2, to be at y=5 at t=6, that's two steps: from y=2 to y=5 in two actions, need +3, impossible, since max +2 (U,U to y=4).\n\nSimilarly to y=6 impossible.\n\nMax from y=2 in two actions: a4 U, y5=3; a5 U, y6=4.\n\nOr if a4 U, a5 S, y6=3; etc, max y=4 at t=6.\n\nCannot reach y=5 or 6 at t=6.\n\nSo not possible.\n\ny=8 at t=6 impossible.\n\nSo only options for t=6 are y=0,1, or possibly y=9 but not.\n\nSo back to being at y=1 at t=6.\n\nThen to avoid t=11, we can be on y=7 at t=11.\n\nFrom t=6 y=1, to t=11, 5 turns, we can go up 5 times to y=6 at t=11, but y=6 at t=11 collision.\n\nOr to y=7 at t=11, but from y=1, after 5 actions, max y=6.\n\nSo impossible to be at y=7 at t=11 from there.\n\nUnless we have a way to move faster, but we can't.\n\nSo we have to pass through y=5 or 6 at a safe time.\n\nSafe times for y=5 and 6 are t=6 to t=10, except t=6 is safe for y=5,6, and t=7,8,9,10 are safe for all, t=11 and 12 dangerous for y=5,6.\n\nt=6 safe for y=5,6, but we can't be there.\n\nt=7 to t=10 safe for all freeways.\n\nt=11 and 12 dangerous for y=5,6.\n\nt=13 and later safe for y=5,6 except τ=8 at t=12, but t=13 safe.\n\nSo for y=5 and 6, safe at t=6,7,8,9,10,13,... dangerous at t=11,12.\n\nTo minimize time, we should pass through y=5 and 6 between t=6 and t=10.\n\nBut at t=6, we are at y=1, so we can start going up.\n\nFrom t=6 y=1, take U to y7=2 at t=7.\n\nU to y8=3 at t=8.\n\nU to y9=4 at t=9.\n\nU to y10=5 at t=10.\n\nNow at t=10, y=5, safe.\n\nThen we need to go to y=6, but at t=11, if on y=6, collision.\n\nSo from t=10 y=5, we can take U to y11=6, but collision at t=11.\n\nTake S to y11=5, collision.\n\nTake D to y11=4, safe.\n\nThen at t=11, y=4.\n\nThen take U to y12=5, but at t=12, y=5, τ=8, collision as before.\n\nTake U to y12=5, collision.\n\nOr take S to y12=4, safe.\n\nOr D to y12=3, etc.\n\nBut to reach y=9, we need to go up.\n\nFrom t=11 y=4, take U to y12=5, but at t=12 on y=5 collision.\n\nSo we must not be on y=5 at t=12.\n\nAt t=12, τ=8, y=5 dangerous.\n\nSo from t=11 y=4, we can take U to y12=5, collision, or S to y12=4, or D to y12=3.\n\nThen at t=12, on y=4 or 3, safe.\n\nThen at t=12, take U to y13=5, but at t=13, y=5, τ=9, freeway 5 at τ=9: first car [-53+54, -42+54]=[1,12], 0 not in; safe.\n\nSimilarly, then we can proceed.\n\nBut let's calculate H.\n\nStart: t=4 y=2\n\na4=D, y5=1\n\na5=S, y6=1 (or a5=D, y6=0, but let's take S for less down)\n\na6=U, y7=2\n\na7=U, y8=3\n\na8=U, y9=4\n\na9=U, y10=5\n\nNow at t=10 y=5\n\nTo avoid t=11, take a10=D, y11=4\n\nAt t=11, y=4, safe\n\na11=U, y12=5\n\nBut at t=12, y=5, but t=12, τ=8, freeway 5 collision, so not.\n\nTake a11=S, y12=4, safe.\n\nThen a12=U, y13=5\n\nAt t=13, y=5, τ=9, safe as above.\n\na13=U, y14=6\n\nAt t=14, y=6, τ=10, freeway 6 at τ=10: first car [-53+60, -42+60]=[7,18], safe; etc.\n\na14=U, y15=7\n\na15=U, y16=8\n\na16=U, y17=9\n\nAt t=17, y=9, reached.\n\nBut H is large, from t=4 to t=17, 13 actions? Let's count actions.\n\nActions from a4 to a16, that's 13 actions, H=13.\n\nBut we can do better.\n\nSince at t=10 y=5, instead of going down, we can go up to y=6 at t=11, but collision, so not.\n\nOr stay, collision.\n\nSo must go down or stay but stay causes collision.\n\nAnother way: from t=10 y=5, take U to y11=6, but collision at t=11, not allowed.\n\nSo no.\n\nPerhaps we can be on y=6 at t=10.\n\nFrom start, how to be at y=6 at t=10.\n\nAt t=4 y=2.\n\nTo t=10, 6 turns, positions t=4 to t=10.\n\nAt t=4 y=2.\n\na4=U, y5=3\n\na5=U, y6=4 but at t=6 y=4 collision, not possible.\n\nIf we avoid t=6 by being at y=1 at t=6, then at t=6 y=1, then a6=U, y7=2; a7=U, y8=3; a8=U, y9=4; a9=U, y10=5; as before, not y=6.\n\nTo reach y=6 at t=10, from t=6 y=1, need to go up 5 steps in 4 turns, impossible.\n\nSo not possible.\n\nMax at t=10 is y=5 from that start point.\n\nSo we have to deal with the t=11 issue.\n\nBut to save time, from t=10 y=5, instead of going down, we can go up to y=6 at t=11, but collision, so we must not do that.\n\nPerhaps at t=9 or earlier, we can be higher.\n\nAt t=9, from above, if we are at y=4 at t=9.\n\nFrom t=6 y=1, a6=U, y7=2; a7=U, y8=3; a8=U, y9=4.\n\nSo at t=9 y=4.\n\nThen a9=U, y10=5 at t=10.\n\nSame as before.\n\nIf at t=8, y=3, we can go U to y9=4, etc.\n\nNo faster.\n\nAnother idea: at the beginning, instead of going to y=1 at t=6, we go to y=0, but similar.\n\nOr, we can be on y=8 at some point, but far.\n\nLet's list all dangerous times: only t=6 for y=2,3,4,7; and t=11,12 for y=5,6.\n\nt=12 for y=5,6, and t=6 for others.\n\nFor y=7, dangerous only at t=6, so at t=7 and later, safe.\n\nSimilarly for y=8, dangerous only at t=16-18, which is late, so for early, safe.\n\nTo reach y=9 fast, we can go directly but avoid the dangerous turns for the rows.\n\nFor example, from t=4 y=2, safe at t=4.\n\nTake U to y5=3, safe at t=5.\n\nThen at t=5, we need to be at a safe y at t=6, but from y=3, we can only go to dangerous y.\n\nSo we must not be at y=3 at t=5.\n\nSimilarly, at t=4, if we take S, y5=2, then at t=5 y=2, safe.\n\nThen from y=2 at t=5, we can take D to y6=1, safe at t=6.\n\nOr take U to y6=3, collision; S to y6=2, collision.\n\nSo only D to y6=1.\n\nOr at t=4 take D to y5=1, then at t=5 take S to y6=1 or D to y6=0.\n\nSo to y=1 at t=6 is the way.\n\nThen from t=6 y=1, we go up to y=2 at t=7, etc., up to y=5 at t=10.\n\nAt t=10 y=5, we can take action to be at y=7 at t=11, but from y=5, at t=10, take U to y11=6, but at t=11 on y=6 collision; or take U twice, but only one action per turn.\n\nFrom y=5 at t=10, after one action, at t=11, y can be 4,5,6, all dangerous or not progress.\n\ny=4 at t=11 is safe, but low.\n\nThen we can go up later.\n\nTo avoid the collision, we can stay at y=4 or lower until t=12 past, but that takes time.\n\nSince the collision at t=11 and 12 for y=5 and 6, we can be on y=7 at t=11.\n\nBut to be on y=7 at t=11 from y=5 at t=10, need to go up 2 steps in one turn, impossible.\n\nSo the fastest is to go down at t=10 to avoid, then go up after t=12.\n\nBut let's calculate the minimal H.\n\nFrom start:\n\nt=4: y=2\n\na4 = D  ( to avoid, but let's see if we can do without D)\n\nI think we must go down at some point.\n\nPerhaps at t=4 take U, but then stuck at t=6.\n\nAnother thought: at t=4, take U to y5=3.\n\nAt t=5, take U to y6=4, but collision, not allowed.\n\nOr take S or D, collision at t=6.\n\nSo no.\n\nSo the only safe way is to be at y=1 at t=6.\n\nThen from there:\n\nt=6: y=1\n\na6 = U, y7=2\n\nt=7: y=2\n\na7 = U, y8=3\n\nt=8: y=3\n\na8 = U, y9=4\n\nt=9: y=4\n\na9 = U, y10=5\n\nt=10: y=5\n\nNow at t=10, we take a10 = D to avoid being on y=5 or 6 at t=11, so a10=D, y11=4\n\nt=11: y=4, safe\n\nThen at t=11, we can take a11 = U to y12=5, but at t=12 on y=5, collision, so not.\n\nTake a11 = S, y12=4, safe.\n\nThen a12 = U, y13=5\n\nt=13: y=5, τ=9, safe\n\na13 = U, y14=6\n\nt=14: y=6, τ=10, safe\n\na14 = U, y15=7\n\na15 = U, y16=8\n\na16 = U, y17=9\n\nAt t=17, y=9.\n\nActions: a4 to a16, 13 actions.\n\nBut we can reach faster by not going down at t=10.\n\nFor example, at t=10 y=5, take S, but at t=11 y=5 collision, not allowed.\n\nSo must move away.\n\nBut we can move to y=6 at t=11, but same collision.\n\nOr, at t=9 y=4, instead of going to y=5 at t=10, we can stay at y=4 for a turn.\n\nAt t=9: y=4\n\nTake a9 = S, y10=4\n\nt=10: y=4, safe\n\nThen a10 = U, y11=5, but at t=11 on y=5, collision, not good.\n\na10 = U to y11=5, collision.\n\nTake a10 = S, y11=4, safe.\n\nThen a11 = U, y12=5, at t=12 on y=5, collision.\n\nSame issue.\n\nTo skip the dangerous period, we need to be at y=7 by t=11.\n\nBut from t=6 y=1, in 5 turns to t=11, max y=6, which is dangerous.\n\nSo impossible to skip with this start.\n\nPerhaps from the beginning, we can go up to y=4 at t=6, but it's dangerous, not allowed.\n\nSo I think the minimal H is 13 with the sequence above.\n\nBut let's see if we can reduce by going to y=6 faster after t=6.\n\nNo, because from y=1 at t=6, to y=6 at t=11 is 5 steps, but at t=11 y=6 collision.\n\nSo we must have a turn where we are not on y=5 or 6 at t=11 and 12.\n\nSo from t=10 to t=11, we go down to y=4.\n\nThen at t=11 y=4, we wait until t=13 to go to y=5.\n\nAt t=11 y=4, take a11 = S, y12=4 (safe at t=12)\n\nThen a12 = U, y13=5 (safe at t=13)\n\nThen a13 = U, y14=6\n\na14 = U, y15=7\n\na15 = U, y16=8\n\na16 = U, y17=9\n\nSame as before, 13 actions.\n\nFrom t=11 y=4, take U to y12=5, but at t=12 collision, not allowed.\n\nSo must stay or go down.\n\nBut going down is worse.\n\nSo minimal actions to reach y=9 is from y=2 to y=9, 7 steps, but with detours, we have extra actions.\n\nIn this case, we have two extra down actions: a4=D and a10=D, so two extra actions, but a4=D is to avoid t=6, and a10=D to avoid t=11, so H=7 +2 +4? Let's count.\n\nFrom y=2 to y=9, net +7.\n\nIn the sequence: a4=D (y down 1), a5=S (y same), a6 to a9: 4U (y up 4), a10=D (y down 1), a11=S (y same), a12=U (y up 1), a13=U (y up 1), a14=U (y up 1), a15=U (y up 1), a16=U (y up 1) to y=9.\n\nList y:\n\nt=4: y=2\n\na4=D: y5=1\n\na5=S: y6=1\n\na6=U: y7=2\n\na7=U: y8=3\n\na8=U: y9=4\n\na9=U: y10=5\n\na10=D: y11=4\n\na11=S: y12=4  (assume we take S at t=11)\n\na12=U: y13=5\n\na13=U: y14=6\n\na14=U: y15=7\n\na15=U: y16=8\n\na16=U: y17=9\n\nSo actions from a4 to a16, 13 actions, H=13.\n\nBut at t=12, we are at y=4, safe.\n\nThen a12=U to y13=5, safe.\n\n etc.\n\nCan we omit some stays?\n\nFor example, at t=11, instead of taking S, we can take U to y12=5, but at t=12 on y=5 collision, not allowed.\n\nSo must take S or D.\n\nS is better.\n\nAt the beginning, at t=5, we took S to stay at y=1, but we could go to y=0, but that might not help.\n\nOr at t=4, take D to y5=1, then at t=5 take U to y6=2, but at t=6 on y=2 collision, not good.\n\nSo we must be at y=1 or 0 at t=6.\n\nWith y=1 at t=6.\n\nThen from there, to reach y=9, we need 8 steps up, but with one down at a10, so net 7 up, but with delays.\n\nNumber of turns from t=6 to t=17, 11 turns for 8 steps, but with one down and one stay, so 11 actions for net +8 from y=1 to y=9, but we have a down and a stay, so 11 actions for net +8, which is correct since we have one down.\n\nFrom y=1 to y=9, difference 8, with one down action, we need 9 up actions to compensate, but we have only 8 up actions from a6 to a16? a6 to a16 is 11 actions, including a10 down and a11 stay, so 9 up actions? Let's count actions from a6 to a16: a6 U, a7 U, a8 U, a9 U, a10 D, a11 S, a12 U, a13 U, a14 U, a15 U, a16 U. That's 11 actions: 9 U, 1 D, 1 S. Net up 8, from y=1 to y=9, correct.\n\nBut the down and stay cost extra turns.\n\nTo save one turn, we can avoid the stay at t=11.\n\nFor example, at t=10 y=5, instead of taking D, we can take U to y11=6, but collision, not.\n\nOr, at t=9 y=4, we can take U to y10=5, then at t=10, instead of staying, we can go directly to y=6 but can't in one action.\n\nNo.\n\nAnother idea: go to y=8 directly, but freeway 8 has collision at t=16,17,18, but if we reach before, ok.\n\nBut from y=2 to y=8, 6 steps, but with detours.\n\nI think 13 is the best we can do.\n\nBut let's confirm if we can be at y=9 earlier.\n\nSuppose we go up faster after t=6.\n\nBut at t=6 y=1, we can only go up one per turn.\n\nUnless we start higher, but we start at y=2.\n\nAt t=4, we can take U, but then we have to go down to avoid t=6, so same.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 5 and 6, at t=10 y=5, we can take the action to move to y=6 at t=11, but since we are not on y=6 at t=10 for collision, but at t=11 we are on y=6 when it has collision, so we collide.\n\nThe note says: if you move to y_{T+1} at turn T, you are not on y_{T+1} at turn T, so for collision at turn T, only y_T matters.\n\nBut at turn T, when you are on y_T, and you take action to go to y_{T+1}, but for collision at T, it's based on y_T.\n\nFor turn T+1, it's based on y_{T+1}.\n\nSo at t=10, we are on y=5, safe.\n\nWe take a10=U, so at turn t=11, we are on y=6, and for turn t=11, we check cars on y=6 at that time, which has collision, so we collide.\n\nSimilarly, if we take S, at t=11 on y=5, collide.\n\nSo must take D to be on y=4 at t=11, safe.\n\nThen proceed.\n\nSo I think H=13 is minimal.\n\nBut let's see the answer format.\n\nWe need to output the sequence for actions from t1=4.\n\nIn the sequence above, actions:\n\nTurn 4: D  (since a4=D)\n\nTurn 5: S  (a5=S)\n\nTurn 6: U  (a6=U)\n\nTurn 7: U  (a7=U)\n\nTurn 8: U  (a8=U)\n\nTurn 9: U  (a9=U)\n\nTurn 10: D  (a10=D)\n\nTurn 11: S  (a11=S)\n\nTurn 12: U  (a12=U)\n\nTurn 13: U  (a13=U)\n\nTurn 14: U  (a14=U)\n\nTurn 15: U  (a15=U)\n\nTurn 16: U  (a16=U)\n\nThen at turn 17, y=9.\n\nH=13 actions, from t=4 to t=16, position at t=17 is 9.\n\nThe sequence is for t from t1 to t1+H-1, so a4 to a16, 13 actions.\n\nBut in the output, it should be from turn t1 to the last action.\n\nPerhaps we can start with S instead of D at t=4.\n\nAt t=4, take a4=S, y5=2\n\nThen a5=D, y6=1 (since if a5=S, y6=2 collision; a5=U, y6=3 collision; so only a5=D to y6=1)\n\nThen same as before.\n\na4=S, a5=D, then from t=6 y=1, same as above.\n\nThen a6=U, etc., same actions from there.\n\nSo similar, H still 13.\n\nWith a4=S, a5=D, then a6 to a16 as above, but a16 is for y17=9, so actions up to a16.\n\nNumber of actions same.\n\nNow, to save one action, perhaps at t=11, instead of S, we can do something else, but no.\n\nOr at t=10, instead of D, we can go to a safe row, but all rows at t=11 are safe except y=5 and 6.\n\nFor example, from t=10 y=5, take D to y11=4, safe.\n\nOr take U to y11=6, collision.\n\nOr S, collision.\n\nNo other choices.\n\nSo I think it's minimal.\n\nBut let's see if we can reach by t=16 or something.\n\nIn the sequence, at t=17 y=9.\n\nFrom t=6 y=1 to t=17 y=9, 11 turns for 8 levels, with one down and one stay, so 11 turns for net +8, which is reasonable.\n\nPerhaps we can go to y=8 at t=16, then to y=9 at t=17.\n\nBut same.\n\nSo I think this is the way.\n\nNow for the sequence, we need to specify the actions.\n\nIn the sequence above, with a4=D or a4=S.\n\nLet's use a4=D to be consistent.\n\nAlso, for freeway 5 and 6, at t=10, we go down to avoid.\n\nBut let's write the actions.\n\nTurn t1=4: action a4\n\nWe have a4, a5, ..., up to a16 for H=13.\n\nBut in the output, it should be listed as:\n\nTurn 4: a_{4}\n\nTurn 5: a_{5}\n\n...\n\nTurn 16: a_{16}\n\nWith actions.\n\nIn my sequence: a4=D, a5=S, a6=U, a7=U, a8=U, a9=U, a10=D, a11=S, a12=U, a13=U, a14=U, a15=U, a16=U\n\nThen at turn 17, y=9.\n\nH=13.\n\nBut let's confirm the collision points.\n\nAt turn 4: y=2, freeway 2, τ=0, safe.\n\nAction a4=D, so y5=1.\n\nTurn 5: y=1, freeway 1, τ=1, safe.\n\nAction a5=S, so y6=1.\n\nTurn 6: y=1, freeway 1, τ=2, safe.\n\nAction a6=U, so y7=2.\n\nTurn 7: y=2, freeway 2, τ=3, safe.\n\nAction a7=U, y8=3.\n\nTurn 8: y=3, freeway 3, τ=4, safe.\n\na8=U, y9=4.\n\nTurn 9: y=4, freeway 4, τ=5, safe.\n\na9=U, y10=5.\n\nTurn 10: y=5, freeway 5, τ=6, safe (as calculated).\n\nAction a10=D, so y11=4.\n\nTurn 11: y=4, freeway 4, τ=7, safe.\n\nAction a11=S, so y12=4.\n\nTurn 12: y=4, freeway 4, τ=8, safe? τ=8, t=12, freeway 4 car: span [-83+36*8, -48+36*8]= [-83+288, -48+288]= [205,240], safe.\n\nAction a12=U, y13=5.\n\nTurn 13: y=5, freeway 5, τ=9, first car [1,12], 0 not in, safe.\n\na13=U, y14=6.\n\nTurn 14: y=6, freeway 6, τ=10, safe.\n\na14=U, y15=7.\n\nTurn 15: y=7, freeway 7, τ=11, span [-35+132, -24+132]= [97,108], safe.\n\na15=U, y16=8.\n\nTurn 16: y=8, freeway 8, τ=12, but τ=12, t=16, freeway 8 car: span [-59+4*12, -48+4*12]= [-59+48, -48+48]= [-11,0], includes 0, collision!\n\nOh no! I forgot freeway 8 at τ=12.\n\nAt t=16, τ=12, freeway 8: span [-59+48, -48+48]= [-11,0], includes 0, so collision if on y=8 at t=16.\n\nIn my sequence, at turn 16, y=8, and collision.\n\nProblem.\n\nI missed that.\n\nFreeway 8 dangerous at τ=12,13,14, t=16,17,18.\n\nAt t=16, on y=8, collision.\n\nSo we cannot be on y=8 at t=16,17,18.\n\nIn the sequence, at t=16, we are on y=8, which is bad.\n\nNeed to avoid that.\n\nSo at t=16, we should not be on y=8.\n\nSimilarly for t=17,18.\n\nBut we can be on y=8 at other times or go directly to y=9.\n\ny=9 is safe.\n\nBut at t=16, from previous, at t=15, y=7, take U to y16=8, collision.\n\nTake S to y16=7, safe.\n\nOr D to y16=6, etc.\n\nThen at t=16, on y=7, safe.\n\nThen take U to y17=8, but at t=17, y=8, τ=13, freeway 8 at τ=13: span [-59+52, -48+52]= [-7,4], includes 0, collision.\n\nSimilarly at t=18, τ=14, [-59+56, -48+56]= [-3,8], includes 0.\n\nSo dangerous at t=16,17,18.\n\nSafe at t=15 or earlier, or t=19 and later.\n\nFor example, at τ=11, t=15, freeway 8: span [-59+44, -48+44]= [-15,-4], safe.\n\nτ=15, t=19, [-59+60, -48+60]= [1,12], safe.\n\nSo to be on y=8, safe at t<=15 or t>=19.\n\nSimilarly for other times.\n\nIn our sequence, at t=14, y=6.\n\nThen a14=U, y15=7.\n\nt=15, y=7, safe.\n\nThen from here, if we take U to y16=8, collision at t=16.\n\nTake S to y16=7, safe.\n\nThen at t=16, y=7, take U to y17=8, but at t=17 on y=8, collision.\n\nTake D to y17=6, etc.\n\nThen to reach y=9, we need to go to y=8 at a safe time, like t=19.\n\nBut that is late.\n\nFrom t=15 y=7, we can go directly to y=9 but can't, only one step per turn.\n\nSo take U to y16=8, but collision, not allowed.\n\nSo must stay or go down.\n\nThen at t=16 y=7, take U to y17=8, collision.\n\nNot good.\n\nSo we need to be at y=8 before t=16 or after t=18.\n\nBefore t=16, like at t=15.\n\nAt t=15, we are at y=7, so we can be at y=8 at t=15 only if from y=7 at t=14, but at t=14 y=6, we take U to y15=7, not to 8.\n\nTo be at y=8 at t=15, from t=14 y=6, need to go up 2 steps, impossible.\n\nSo only after t=18.\n\nAt t=18, τ=14, dangerous; t=19 safe.\n\nSo at t=19, we can be on y=8 safe.\n\nThen to y=9.\n\nBut let's integrate.\n\nFirst, from the start, we need to adjust for freeway 8.\n\nIn the earlier path, we have up to t=14 y=6.\n\nThen a14=U, y15=7 (t=15 y=7)\n\nThen at t=15, take a15=S, y16=7 (safe)\n\nThen a16=S, y17=7 (safe, but not progress)\n\nThen at t=17, take a17=U, y18=8, but at t=18 on y=8, collision.\n\nNot good.\n\nTake a15=S, y16=7\n\nThen a16=U, y17=8, collision at t=17.\n\nMust wait until t=19.\n\nSo at t=15 y=7, take a15=S, y16=7\n\na16=S, y17=7\n\na17=S, y18=7\n\na18=U, y19=8\n\nAt t=19, y=8, τ=15, safe.\n\nThen a19=U, y20=9\n\nAt t=20, y=9.\n\nBut this is even worse, H larger.\n\nFrom t=15 y=7, we can go down to lower rows and come back, but that takes more time.\n\nTo save time, we can be at y=8 at t=15, but impossible from position.\n\nAt t=10, we are at y=5, instead of going down, we can go up slower or something.\n\nBut let's go back to the point before freeway 8 issue.\n\nAt t=14, y=6.\n\nInstead of going to y=7 at t=15, we can go to y=7 at t=15, then stay until t=19, but long.\n\nSince freeway 8 is dangerous at t=16,17,18, we can be on y=9 before that.\n\nFor example, at t=15, if we are at y=8, then to y=9 at t=16, but at t=16 on y=8 collision if we are there.\n\nIf at t=15 y=8, safe at t=15, then take U to y16=9, at t=16 on y=9, safe, no freeway.\n\nBut to be at y=8 at t=15.\n\nFrom t=4, how to be at y=8 at t=15.\n\nBut with the detours, we are at y=6 at t=14.\n\nFrom y=6 at t=14, to y=8 at t=15 impossible.\n\nMax y=7 at t=15.\n\nSo cannot.\n\nThe earliest we can be at y=8 is t=15 from a better start, but we have delays.\n\nI think for this configuration, the minimal H is around 13 with avoiding the collisions.\n\nBut with freeway 8, in the sequence, at t=16 we have issue.\n\nSo let's modify the sequence to avoid freeway 8 at bad times.\n\nFrom t=14 y=6.\n\nTake a14=U, y15=7 (t=15 y=7)\n\nThen at t=15, y=7, safe.\n\nInstead of going to y=8 immediately, we can go to y=6 or something, but not efficient.\n\nTake a15=S, y16=7\n\nThen at t=16, y=7, safe (freeway 7 at τ=12: span [-35+144, -24+144]= [109,120], safe)\n\nThen a16=U, y17=8\n\nBut at t=17, y=8, τ=13, freeway 8 span [-59+52, -48+52]= [-7,4], includes 0, collision.\n\nNot good.\n\nTake a16=D, y17=6, safe.\n\nThen at t=17, y=6, τ=13, freeway 6 at τ=13: first car [-53+78, -42+78]=[25,36], safe; etc.\n\nThen a17=U, y18=7\n\na18=U, y19=8\n\nAt t=19, y=8, τ=15, safe.\n\na19=U, y20=9\n\nH even larger.\n\nTo reach faster, from t=15 y=7, we can take no action to stay, but we need to go up.\n\nThe best is to go to y=9 directly from y=7, but can't.\n\nI think for this problem, with the given car positions, the minimal H is 13 with the sequence I had, but with the freeway 8 collision at t=16, so we need to adjust.\n\nIn the sequence, at t=15 we are at y=7, and we want to go to y=9, but we have to pass through y=8.\n\nSo we must be on y=8 at some safe turn.\n\nSafe turns for y=8 are t<=15 or t>=19.\n\nt=15: at t=15, y=8 is safe, as above.\n\nBut at t=15, we are at y=7, so if we can be at y=8 at t=15, but we can't from y=7 at t=14.\n\nAt t=14, we are at y=6, so y15=7.\n\nSo not at y=8.\n\nNext safe is t=19.\n\nSo we have to wait or something.\n\nBut let's list the sequence from beginning with times.\n\nPerhaps start with a different action.\n\nAnother idea: at t=4, take U to y5=3.\n\nThen at t=5, take U to y6=4, but collision, not allowed.\n\nSo not possible.\n\nI think I have to accept a longer H or find a way.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 5 and 6, at t=10, instead of going down, we go up to y=6 at t=11, but collision, not.\n\nOr, since freeway 7 is safe after t=6, we can go to y=7 earlier.\n\nBut from the start, we are low.\n\nLet's calculate the minimal possible.\n\nFrom y=2 to y=9, 7 levels.\n\nThe dangerous turns are t=6 and t=11,12 for specific rows.\n\nTo avoid t=6, we lose at least one turn (by going down or staying).\n\nSimilarly, to avoid t=11,12 for y=5,6, we lose at least one turn.\n\nThen for freeway 8, we may lose more.\n\nBut in this case, for freeway 8, if we reach y=8 before t=16, it's safe.\n\nFor example, at t=15, y=8 safe.\n\nSo if we can be at y=8 at t=15.\n\nFrom t=4 y=2, in 11 turns to t=15, we can go up 11 levels, but y max 9, so possible if no detours.\n\nBut with detours for t=6, we are at y=1 at t=6, then from t=6 to t=15, 9 turns, from y=1 to y=8, 7 levels, so possible with 2 extra actions or something.\n\nFrom y=1 at t=6, to y=8 at t=15, difference 7 levels in 9 turns, so we can have 2 stays or one down and one up, etc.\n\nFor example, from t=6 y=1:\n\na6=U, y7=2\n\na7=U, y8=3\n\na8=U, y9=4\n\na9=U, y10=5\n\na10=U, y11=6 but at t=11 on y=6 collision, not.\n\nSo we need to avoid.\n\nAt t=10 y=5, take a10=S, y11=5 collision, not.\n\nTake a10=D, y11=4\n\nThen a11=U, y12=5 but at t=12 on y=5 collision, not.\n\nTake a11=S, y12=4\n\na12=U, y13=5\n\na13=U, y14=6\n\na14=U, y15=7\n\nAt t=15 y=7, not y=8.\n\nThen to y=8 at t=16, but collision on y=8.\n\nSo at t=15 y=7, take a15=U, y16=8, collision at t=16.\n\nNot good.\n\nFrom t=14 y=6, take U to y15=7.\n\nThen to reach y=8 at t=19.\n\nSo H=15 or more.\n\nI think for this problem, it might be possible with H=12 or less, but I doubt.\n\nPerhaps we can be on y=9 at t=11 or something, but impossible.\n\nI think I have to go with the sequence and handle freeway 8 by being on y=8 at t=19.\n\nBut let's assume the sequence I have and output it, but with freeway 8 collision, so need to change.\n\nPerhaps for the output, since the question might not require handling freeway 8 if we reach early, but in this case we don't.\n\nAnother thought: at t=4, take U to y5=3.\n\nThen at t=5, take U to y6=4, but collision, not allowed, so the game would collide, so not possible.\n\nSo I think the only way is the sequence with H=13 and then for freeway 8, at t=15 y=7, we take S to stay at y=7 for a few turns.\n\nBut let's set the sequence as:\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 4: D\n\nTurn 5: S\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: D\n\nTurn 11: S\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\n turn 14: U to y15=7\n\nThen at t=15 y=7, we need to go to y=8, but dangerous until t=19.\n\nSo take Turn 15: S  (y16=7)\n\nTurn 16: S  (y17=7)\n\nTurn 17: S  (y18=7)\n\nTurn 18: U  (y19=8)\n\nTurn 19: U  (y20=9)\n\nBut H=16 actions, large.\n\nFrom t=15 y=7, take Turn 15: U to y16=8, but collision, not allowed.\n\nSo must avoid.\n\nI think there's a mistake in the car state.\n\nFor freeway 8, cars: (-48, -59, right, 4)? Tail=-59, head=-48, direction right, speed 4.\n\nSpan at τ: [-59 + 4τ, -48 + 4τ]\n\n0 in span when -59 +4τ <=0<= -48+4τ\n\nAs before, τ>=12 and τ<=14.75, so t=16,17,18.\n\nAt t=15, τ=11, span [-59+44, -48+44]= [-15,-4], 0 not in, safe.\n\nAt t=19, τ=15, [-59+60, -48+60]= [1,12], safe.\n\nSo only dangerous at t=16,17,18.\n\nNow, to be at y=8 at t=15 or t=19.\n\nIn our path, at t=14, y=6.\n\nTake U to y15=7 at t=15.\n\nThen from y=7 at t=15, we can take U to y16=8 at t=16, collision, not.\n\nOr stay at y=7 for several turns.\n\nThen at t=18, take U to y19=8 at t=19, safe.\n\nThen U to y20=9.\n\nBut from t=15 to t=18, we stay at y=7, which is safe, but waste turns.\n\nTo minimize H, we should not stay, but we have to.\n\nFrom y=7 at t=15, we can go down to y=6 or lower, but that takes more actions to come back.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo the fastest is to stay at y=7 from t=15 to t=18, then go to y=8 at t=19 and y=9 at t=20.\n\nH=16 actions from a4 to a19.\n\nBut let's count the turns.\n\nAt t=4: y=2\n\na4=D: t=5 y=1\n\na5=S: t=6 y=1\n\na6=U: t=7 y=2\n\na7=U: t=8 y=3\n\na8=U: t=9 y=4\n\na9=U: t=10 y=5\n\na10=D: t=11 y=4\n\na11=S: t=12 y=4\n\na12=U: t=13 y=5\n\na13=U: t=14 y=6\n\na14=U: t=15 y=7\n\nNow at t=15 y=7\n\na15=S: t=16 y=7\n\na16=S: t=17 y=7\n\na17=S: t=18 y=7\n\na18=U: t=19 y=8\n\na19=U: t=20 y=9\n\nActions from a4 to a19, 16 actions.\n\nH=16.\n\nThen at t=20 y=9.\n\nBut this seems long.\n\nPerhaps we can reach y=9 at t=19 by being at y=8 at t=18, but t=18 y=8 collision.\n\nNot.\n\nSo I think this is the way.\n\nBut let's see if we can be at y=8 at t=15 from the beginning.\n\nFor example, from t=4 y=2, all U: a4=U, t=5 y=3; a5=U, t=6 y=4 collision, not possible.\n\nSo cannot.\n\nTherefore, for this game, the minimal H is 16 with the sequence above.\n\nBut I feel like it might not be minimal, but I can't see a shorter path.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 5 and 6, at t=10, we don't go down, but go to y=6 at t=11, but collision, so not.\n\nI think I have to accept it.\n\nSo the sequence of actions:\n\nTurn 4: D\n\nTurn 5: S\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: D\n\nTurn 11: S\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: S\n\nTurn 16: S\n\nTurn 17: S\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nThen at turn 20, y=9.\n\nH=16 actions.\n\nIn the output, for turn t1=4 to turn 4+15=19, actions a4 to a19.\n\nH=16.\n\nBut let's write in the format.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 4: D\nTurn 5: S\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: D\nTurn 11: S\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: S\nTurn 16: S\nTurn 17: S\nTurn 18: U\nTurn 19: U\n}\n\nBut Turn 19: U to y20=9.\n\nAnd the position at turn 20 is (0,9).\n\nI think this works, but H is large.\n\nPerhaps we can omit one S at the end.\n\nFor example, at t=15 y=7, instead of staying 3 turns, we can go to y=8 at t=19 directly, but we have to wait.\n\nNo.\n\nOr, since y=9 is safe, we can go from y=7 to y=9 in two steps, but must go through y=8.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 2)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 4\\) is 16, with the sequence of actions avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Collision Avoidance Summary:\n- **Turn 6 (τ=2)**: Freeways 2, 3, 4, and 7 are dangerous. Player must be at y=1 (safe) at this turn.\n- **Turns 11 and 12 (τ=7 and τ=8)**: Freeways 5 and 6 are dangerous. Player must not be on y=5 or y=6 at these turns.\n- **Turns 16, 17, and 18 (τ=12, 13, 14)**: Freeway 8 is dangerous. Player must not be on y=8 at these turns.\n\n### Sequence Rationale:\n- **Turns 4-5**: Move down to y=1 by turn 6 to avoid collision on turn 6.\n- **Turns 6-9**: Move up steadily to y=5 by turn 10, avoiding collisions during safe periods.\n- **Turn 10**: Move down to y=4 to avoid being on y=5 or y=6 at turns 11 and 12.\n- **Turns 11-12**: Stay at y=4 to avoid collisions and prepare for upward movement.\n- **Turns 13-14**: Move up to y=7 by turn 15.\n- **Turns 15-17**: Stay at y=7 to avoid collision on freeway 8 at turns 16, 17, and 18.\n- **Turns 18-19**: Move up to y=9 by turn 20, avoiding freeway 8 collisions and reaching the goal.\n\n### Action Sequence:\nThe sequence of actions \\(\\{a_t\\}_{t=4}^{19}\\) ensures the player reaches \\((0, 9)\\) at turn 20 with no collisions:\n- At turn 4, action \\(D\\) moves to y=1 at turn 5.\n- At turn 5, action \\(S\\) stays at y=1 for turn 6.\n- At turn 6, action \\(U\\) moves to y=2 at turn 7.\n- At turn 7, action \\(U\\) moves to y=3 at turn 8.\n- At turn 8, action \\(U\\) moves to y=4 at turn 9.\n- At turn 9, action \\(U\\) moves to y=5 at turn 10.\n- At turn 10, action \\(D\\) moves to y=4 at turn 11 to avoid y=5 and y=6 at turn 11.\n- At turn 11, action \\(S\\) stays at y=4 for turn 12 to avoid y=5 and y=6 at turn 12.\n- At turn 12, action \\(U\\) moves to y=5 at turn 13.\n- At turn 13, action \\(U\\) moves to y=6 at turn 14.\n- At turn 14, action \\(U\\) moves to y=7 at turn 15.\n- At turn 15, action \\(S\\) stays at y=7 for turn 16 to avoid freeway 8 collision.\n- At turn 16, action \\(S\\) stays at y=7 for turn 17 to avoid freeway 8 collision.\n- At turn 17, action \\(S\\) stays at y=7 for turn 18 to avoid freeway 8 collision.\n- At turn 18, action \\(U\\) moves to y=8 at turn 19 (safe, as τ=15).\n- At turn 19, action \\(U\\) moves to y=9 at turn 20.\n\n### Output:\n\\boxed{\nTurn 4: D \\\\\nTurn 5: S \\\\\nTurn 6: U \\\\\nTurn 7: U \\\\\nTurn 8: U \\\\\nTurn 9: U \\\\\nTurn 10: D \\\\\nTurn 11: S \\\\\nTurn 12: U \\\\\nTurn 13: U \\\\\nTurn 14: U \\\\\nTurn 15: S \\\\\nTurn 16: S \\\\\nTurn 17: S \\\\\nTurn 18: U \\\\\nTurn 19: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) at turn t1=6 to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to 8. The player moves up, down, or stays, changing y by +1, -1, or 0, and y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars move with constant speed, left or right. For collision, it happens only if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T and there's a car on that freeway where 0 is in its span at that exact turn. Importantly, when moving to a new row, you're not on that row until the next turn, so you only check for collisions on the row you're currently on.\n\nThe car positions are given at turn t1=6. For future turns T > t1, the car spans are updated based on their speed and direction.\n\nFirst, I need to find out where the cars are at future turns relative to x=0, since collision happens only if 0 is in the span at the turn when the player is on that row.\n\nThe player starts at y=0 at turn 6. y=0 is not a freeway, so no cars there, so it's safe. But I need to get to y=9.\n\nThe freeways are y=1 to 8, each with cars.\n\nI should compute for each freeway, at which turns a car covers x=0.\n\nFor a car on freeway k, with initial head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s at turn t1=6.\n\nThe span at turn T is:\n\nIf left-moving: [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nSince it moves left, decreasing x.\n\nDirection: let's see the given.\n\nFor example, freeway 1: (-48, -71, right, 24)\n\nHead and tail: for right-moving, it says span [τ, h] and moves to [τ + s dt, h + s dt] where dt = T - t1.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, [h, τ] to [h - s dt, τ - s dt], but in the table, for left, it might be specified differently? All these are right-moving except... let's check.\n\nIn the car state, direction is given: all seem to be right except... freeway 1: right, freeway 2: right, etc. All are right-moving? Let me list:\n\nFreeway 1: (-48, -71, right, 24)\n\nFreeway 2: (-48, -83, right, 36)\n\nFreeway 3: (-48, -83, right, 36)\n\nFreeway 4: (-48, -83, right, 36)\n\nFreeway 5: three cars: (48,37,right,6), (12,1,right,6), (-24,-35,right,6)\n\nFreeway 6: same as 5? (48,37,right,6), (12,1,right,6), (-24,-35,right,6)\n\nFreeway 7: (48,37,right,12)\n\nFreeway 8: (48,37,right,4)\n\nAll cars are right-moving. No left-moving cars. That might simplify.\n\nFor right-moving cars, the span at turn T is:\n\nInitial span at t1: since right, head is larger, tail smaller. In the notation, for right, it says span [τ, h] meaning from τ to h, with τ < h I assume.\n\nIn freeway 1: head -48, tail -71? -48 > -71, so head is larger, tail smaller.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nSo for right-moving, initial position: tail τ, head h, with τ < h.\n\nAt turn T, position: tail = τ + s (T - t1), head = h + s (T - t1)\n\nThen span is [τ + s dt, h + s dt] where dt = T - t1\n\n0 is covered if τ + s dt ≤ 0 ≤ h + s dt\n\nSimilarly for left, but all right here.\n\nNow t1 = 6.\n\nI need for each freeway k, for which T, 0 is in some car's span on that freeway.\n\nSince multiple cars per freeway for some, I need to find when at least one car covers 0.\n\nFirst, let's handle each freeway separately.\n\nStart with freeway 1: k=1, car: tail τ = -71, head h = -48, s=24, right.\n\ndt = T - 6\n\nPosition at T: tail = -71 + 24 dt, head = -48 + 24 dt\n\n0 covered if -71 + 24 dt ≤ 0 ≤ -48 + 24 dt\n\nSolve inequalities:\n\nLeft: -71 + 24 dt ≤ 0 ⇒ 24 dt ≤ 71 ⇒ dt ≤ 71/24 ≈ 2.958, so dt ≤ 2 since integer? T and dt are integers? Turns are discrete, so T integer, dt integer.\n\nt1=6, T >=6, integer turns.\n\nSo dt integer.\n\n-71 + 24 dt ≤ 0 ⇒ 24 dt ≤ 71 ⇒ dt ≤ floor(71/24) = 2? 24*2=48, 48<71? 71-48=23, so 24 dt ≤71, dt <=2 since 24*2=48<=71, 24*3=72>71, but let's see:\n\n-71 + 24 dt <=0 ⇒ 24 dt <=71 ⇒ dt <= 71/24 ≈2.958, so dt <=2? But 24*2=48, -71+48= -23 <=0, true.\n\n24*3=72, -71+72=1 >0? -71+72=1, which is >0, so -71+24dt <=0 when dt <=2? Let's compute:\n\ndt=0: -71 +0 = -71 <=0, true\n\ndt=1: -71+24= -47 <=0, true\n\ndt=2: -71+48= -23 <=0, true\n\ndt=3: -71+72=1 >0, false\n\nNow right inequality: 0 <= -48 + 24 dt ⇒ 48 <= 24 dt ⇒ dt >= 2\n\n0 <= -48 + 24 dt ⇒ 24 dt >= 48 ⇒ dt >= 2\n\nSo both: dt <=2 and dt >=2? From left: -71+24dt <=0 for dt<=2? dt=0,1,2: -71+24dt <=0\n\ndt=0: -71<=0 true\n\ndt=1: -47<=0 true\n\ndt=2: -23<=0 true\n\ndt=3:1>0 false\n\nBut for right inequality: 0 <= -48 +24 dt ⇒ 24 dt >=48 ⇒ dt >=2\n\nSo 0 <= -48 +24 dt only when dt >=2\n\nFor dt=2: -48+48=0, so 0<=0 true\n\ndt=1: -48+24= -24, 0 <= -24? false\n\ndt=0: -48, 0<= -48 false\n\ndt=3: -48+72=24, 0<=24 true\n\nSo for freeway 1, 0 covered when both inequalities hold: left <=0 and 0<=right.\n\nSo -71+24dt <=0 and 0 <= -48 +24dt\n\nWhich is dt <= 71/24 ≈2.958 and dt >= 48/24=2\n\nSince dt integer, dt=2 only.\n\nBecause dt=2: left: -71+48= -23 <=0 true, right: -48+48=0 <=0 true\n\ndt=1: left: -71+24= -47<=0 true, right: -48+24= -24, 0 <= -24 false\n\ndt=0: left true, right false\n\ndt=3: left false, right true\n\nSo only at dt=2, which is T= t1 + dt =6+2=8\n\nT=8, 0 covered on freeway 1.\n\nNow, is that the only car? Yes, freeway 1 has one car.\n\nSo on freeway 1, collision at T=8 if player is there.\n\nNow freeway 2: k=2, car: tail τ=-83, head h=-48, s=36, right\n\nPosition at T: tail = -83 + 36 dt, head = -48 + 36 dt\n\n0 covered if -83 +36 dt <=0 <= -48 +36 dt\n\nLeft: -83 +36 dt <=0 ⇒ 36 dt <=83 ⇒ dt <= 83/36 ≈2.305, so dt <=2\n\nRight: 0 <= -48 +36 dt ⇒ 36 dt >=48 ⇒ dt >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈1.333, so dt >=2 since integer? dt >= ceil(1.333)=2\n\nCompute:\n\ndt=0: left: -83<=0 true, right: 0<= -48 false → no\n\ndt=1: left: -83+36= -47 <=0 true, right: -48+36= -12, 0<= -12 false → no\n\ndt=2: left: -83+72= -11 <=0 true, right: -48+72=24, 0<=24 true → yes\n\ndt=3: left: -83+108=25 >0 false, right: -48+108=60>0 true, but left false so no\n\nSo only at dt=2, T=8\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as freeway 2? τ=-83, h=-48, s=36, right, so same as k=2, only at T=8\n\nFreeway 4: also same, (-48,-83,right,36), same, T=8\n\nNow freeway 5: multiple cars.\n\nFirst car: (48,37,right,6) head=48, tail=37? For right, span [τ,h] with τ<h, so here head=48, tail=37? 37<48, so τ=37, h=48, s=6\n\nPosition at T: tail = 37 + 6 dt, head = 48 + 6 dt\n\n0 covered if 37 +6 dt <=0 <=48 +6 dt\n\nBut 37 +6 dt <=0? Since dt>=0, 37+6dt >=37>0, so left part always false, never <=0. So this car never covers x<=0, since it starts at x=37 to 48 and moves right, so x increasing from 37, so 0 not covered. Irrelevant for collision at x=0.\n\nSecond car on freeway 5: (12,1,right,6) so τ=1, h=12, s=6\n\nPosition: tail=1 +6 dt, head=12 +6 dt\n\n0 covered if 1+6dt <=0 <=12+6dt\n\n1+6dt <=0? 1+6dt >=1>0, always false, so never covers x<=0. Similarly, this car is at x=1 to 12, moving right, so min x=1>0, never covers 0.\n\nThird car: (-24,-35,right,6) τ=-35, h=-24, s=6\n\nPosition: tail= -35 +6 dt, head= -24 +6 dt\n\n0 covered if -35 +6 dt <=0 <= -24 +6 dt\n\nLeft: -35 +6 dt <=0 ⇒ 6 dt <=35 ⇒ dt <= 35/6 ≈5.833, so dt <=5\n\nRight: 0 <= -24 +6 dt ⇒ 6 dt >=24 ⇒ dt >=4\n\nSo both: dt >=4 and dt <=5\n\ndt=4: left: -35+24= -11 <=0 true, right: -24+24=0, 0<=0 true\n\ndt=5: left: -35+30= -5 <=0 true, right: -24+30=6, 0<=6 true\n\ndt=3: left: -35+18= -17 <=0 true, right: -24+18= -6, 0<= -6 false\n\ndt=6: left: -35+36=1>0 false, right: -24+36=12>0 true, but left false\n\nSo for this car, 0 covered at dt=4 and dt=5, T=6+4=10, T=11\n\nBut freeway 5 has multiple cars, but only this one can cover 0, at T=10 and 11.\n\nNow freeway 6: same as freeway 5? Cars: (48,37,right,6), (12,1,right,6), (-24,-35,right,6)\n\nSame as freeway 5, so only the third car covers 0 at dt=4 and 5, T=10 and 11.\n\nNow freeway 7: one car (48,37,right,12) so τ=37, h=48, s=12\n\nPosition: tail=37+12 dt, head=48+12 dt\n\n0 covered if 37+12 dt <=0 <=48+12 dt\n\n37+12 dt <=0? Impossible since min 37>0, so never covers 0. Irrelevant.\n\nFreeway 8: one car (48,37,right,4) τ=37, h=48, s=4\n\nSimilarly, tail=37+4 dt >=37>0, never <=0, so never covers 0.\n\nSo summary of dangerous times for each freeway:\n\n- Freeway 1: dangerous at T=8\n\n- Freeway 2: dangerous at T=8\n\n- Freeway 3: dangerous at T=8\n\n- Freeway 4: dangerous at T=8\n\n- Freeway 5: dangerous at T=10 and 11 (from the third car)\n\n- Freeway 6: dangerous at T=10 and 11\n\n- Freeway 7: never dangerous\n\n- Freeway 8: never dangerous\n\nFreeways 7 and 8 are always safe at x=0.\n\nNow, player starts at y=0, turn t1=6.\n\ny=0 is not a freeway, so no issue.\n\nI need to reach y=9, which is also not a freeway, so once I reach y=9, I'm done, no need to be there at a safe time, since no cars.\n\nThe goal is to have y=9 at some turn, and since y=9 has no freeway, no collision possible.\n\nNow, I need to move from y=0 to y=9, passing through freeways y=1 to 8, but only when it's safe.\n\nThe player can move up, down, or stay, so I can control the path.\n\nI need minimal H, so probably move up as fast as possible, but avoid the dangerous times.\n\nStart at turn 6, y=0.\n\nAt each turn, I choose action U, D, S, changing y by +1, -1, 0.\n\ny must be integer between 0 and 9.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nThe minimal number of turns to go from y=0 to y=9 is 9 moves up, so H=9 turns? But I might need to wait or something to avoid collisions.\n\nH is the number of turns including the starting turn? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence is from t=0 to H-1 for actions, starting from t1.\n\nDefine the turns.\n\nCurrent turn is t1=6.\n\nPlayer position at turn t1 is (0, y_{t1}) = (0,0)\n\nThen I apply actions a_{t1}, a_{t1+1}, ..., a_{t1 + H-1} for H actions, so after H actions, at turn t1 + H, position y_{t1 + H} = ?\n\nThe update: after action at t, position at t+1.\n\ny_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t based on a_t.\n\nSo at turn t, position y_t.\n\nAfter action a_t, at turn t+1, y_{t+1}.\n\nTo reach y=9, I need y_{t1 + H} = 9 for some H.\n\nAfter H actions, I am at turn t1 + H.\n\nStarting from turn t1, position known.\n\nAfter 0 actions, at turn t1, y_{t1} =0\n\nAfter 1 action, at turn t1+1, y_{t1+1}\n\n...\n\nAfter k actions, at turn t1 + k, y_{t1 + k}\n\nI need y_{t1 + H} =9 for some H.\n\nThe minimal H without obstacles is 9, since I need to increase y by 9, each U increases by 1, so at least 9 U moves, and H=9 actions, from t1 to t1+8? Let's see.\n\nStart: turn t1, y=0\n\nAfter a_{t1}, at turn t1+1, y could be 1 if U, or 0 if S, etc.\n\nAfter first action (at t1), at turn t1+1, y_{t1+1}\n\nTo reach y=9, I need after some action, y_t =9 for t>t1.\n\nSuppose I do all U: at turn t1, action U, then at turn t1+1, y=1\n\nAction U at t1+1, turn t1+2, y=2\n\n...\n\nAfter 9 U actions: at turn t1+9, y=9\n\nSo with H=9 actions, I reach y=9 at turn t1+9.\n\nI could reach earlier? No, because each action changes y by at most 1, from 0 to 9, min 9 actions.\n\nIf I start at y=0, after 0 actions, y=0, not 9.\n\nAfter 1 action, y<=1, not 9.\n\n...\n\nAfter 8 actions, y<=8, not 9.\n\nAfter 9 actions, y<=9, and if all U, y=9.\n\nSo minimal H is 9, if no obstacles.\n\nBut with obstacles, I might need to wait or go down, but since I need to go up, going down might not help, or waiting might be necessary.\n\nIn this case, since dangerous times are only at specific turns, I might need to avoid being on certain rows at those turns.\n\nNow, the dangerous times are:\n\n- At T=8, freeways 1,2,3,4 are dangerous. That is, if player is on y=1,2,3, or 4 at turn T=8, collision.\n\nT=8 is a specific turn.\n\nAlso, at T=10 and 11, freeways 5 and 6 are dangerous, so if on y=5 or 6 at T=10 or T=11.\n\nNow, turns: t1=6.\n\nSo turn 6: y=0\n\nTurn 7: after action at 6\n\nTurn 8: after action at 7\n\n...\n\nI need to plan the actions from turn t1=6 onwards.\n\nLet me denote the turn sequence.\n\nTurn T: | 6    | 7    | 8    | 9    | 10   | 11   | 12   | ... \n\ny_T:  | 0    | ?    | ?    | ?    | ?    | ?    | ?    | ...\n\nActions a_T for T=6,7,8,... determining y_{T+1}\n\na_T chosen at turn T, affects y_{T+1}.\n\ny_{T+1} = y_T + Δy_T with Δy based on a_T.\n\nFor collision: at turn T, if y_T is between 1 and 8, and for that freeway k=y_T, if at turn T, 0 is covered, then collision.\n\nIf y_T=0 or 9, no collision.\n\nNow, at turn T=8, which is dangerous for y=1,2,3,4.\n\nSo at turn 8, player must not be on y=1,2,3, or 4.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 10, if on y=5 or 6, collision.\n\nAt turn 11, if on y=5 or 6, collision.\n\nNow, since freeways 7 and 8 are always safe, y=7 and 8 are always safe to be on, as long as no cars, but we saw no danger.\n\ny=7 and 8 freeways, but cars never cover 0, so always safe at x=0.\n\nSimilarly, y=5 and 6 are safe except at T=10 and 11.\n\ny=1,2,3,4 are safe except at T=8.\n\nNow, I need to reach y=9.\n\nStart at turn 6, y=0.\n\nI need to be at y=9 at some turn.\n\nMinimal path: go up directly.\n\nBut let's see the turns.\n\nTurn 6: y=0, safe, since not freeway.\n\nAction a_6: I can choose U, D, S.\n\nIf U, to y=1 at turn 7.\n\nBut turn 7: if y=1, freeway 1, is it dangerous? From above, freeway 1 dangerous only at T=8, not at T=7.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways not dangerous except at specific times.\n\nAt T=7, for example, freeway 1: we saw only dangerous at T=8.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 5 dangerous at T=10,11, not before or after except those.\n\nSo at T=7, all freeways are safe, I think.\n\nSimilarly, except the dangerous turns, all other times are safe for all rows.\n\nNow, back to min H.\n\nIf I go all U:\n\na_6: U, turn 7: y=1\n\na_7: U, turn 8: y=2\n\nBut turn 8: y=2, which is freeway 2, and T=8 is dangerous! Collision.\n\nSo cannot be on y=2 at turn 8.\n\nSimilarly, if I go slower, but I need to avoid being on y=1-4 at turn 8.\n\nSpecifically, at turn 8, must not be on y=1,2,3,4.\n\nSo possible positions at turn 8: y=0, or y=5,6,7,8, or 9 but not yet.\n\ny=0 is possible, or higher.\n\nNow, from turn 6 to turn 8, I have two actions: a_6 and a_7, determining y_7 and y_8.\n\ny_7 = y_6 + Δy_6 = 0 + Δy_6, so y_7 can be 1 (if U), 0 (if S or D, but D to -1 not allowed, y min 0, so if D, y=0, but at y=0, if I go D, y_{t+1} = max(0, y_t -1), so if y=0, D: y=0, S:y=0, U:y=1.\n\nSimilarly, y=9, U:y=9, etc.\n\nSo from y=0 at turn 6:\n\nAfter a_6:\n\n- If U, y_7=1\n\n- If S, y_7=0\n\n- If D, y_7=0\n\nThen at turn 7, after a_7, y_8.\n\nNow, y_8 must not be in {1,2,3,4} because T=8 dangerous for those rows.\n\nSo y_8 <=0 or >=5, but y>=0, so y_8=0 or y_8>=5.\n\nBut from y_7, to y_8.\n\ny_7 can be 0 or 1.\n\nIf y_7=0, then:\n\na_7: U -> y_8=1\n\nS -> y_8=0\n\nD -> y_8=0\n\nBut y_8=1 is not allowed, since y=1 at T=8 dangerous.\n\ny_8=0 is allowed.\n\nIf y_7=1, then:\n\na_7: U -> y_8=2, not allowed (y=2 at T=8)\n\nS -> y_8=1, not allowed\n\nD -> y_8=0, allowed\n\nSo only possible safe at turn 8:\n\n- If y_7=0, then a_7 must be S or D, so y_8=0\n\n- If y_7=1, then a_7 must be D, so y_8=0\n\nIn both cases, y_8 must be 0 to be safe at turn 8.\n\nBecause if y_7=0, I can only have y_8=0 by S or D, not U.\n\nIf y_7=1, only y_8=0 by D.\n\nSo essentially, at turn 8, y must be 0.\n\nThen, from there, I need to go to y=9.\n\nNow, after turn 8, I can go up.\n\nBut there are also dangers at T=10 and 11 for y=5 and 6.\n\nFirst, let's get past turn 8.\n\nSo at turn 8, y=0.\n\nNow, turn 8: y=0, safe.\n\nNow, actions from here.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nFrom turn 8, y=0.\n\nThen I can start going up.\n\nBut let's see the time.\n\nTurn 8: y=0\n\nThen a_8: action at turn 8, to y_9.\n\na_8: U -> y_9=1\n\nS -> y_9=0\n\nD -> y_9=0\n\nNow, turn 9: y_9\n\nThen a_9, to y_10\n\nAnd so on.\n\nNow, dangers at T=10 and 11 for y=5 and 6.\n\nAt turn 10, if y_10=5 or 6, collision.\n\nSimilarly turn 11, if y_11=5 or 6, collision.\n\nI need to avoid that.\n\nNow, from turn 8, y=0.\n\nI need to go up to y=9.\n\nEach U increases y by 1, so from y=0 to y=9, 9 steps.\n\nBut I have to pass through y=1 to 8.\n\nThe critical part is around turns 10 and 11.\n\nSince y=7 and 8 are always safe, I might want to be on higher rows earlier.\n\nBut I start from low.\n\nLet me list possible y at each turn.\n\nTurn 6: y=0\n\nAfter a_6: to turn 7 y_7\n\nAs we must have y_8=0, and from above, y_7 must be such that I can reach y_8=0.\n\ny_7 can be 0 or 1.\n\nIf y_7=0, then a_7 must be S or D to have y_8=0\n\nIf y_7=1, a_7 must be D to have y_8=0\n\nBut at turn 7, if y_7=1, is it safe? Freeway 1, at T=7, not dangerous, only T=8 dangerous, so T=7 y=1 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, T=7 y=0 safe.\n\nNow, to minimize time, I should not waste moves, so probably better to go up as much as possible before turn 8, but I have to be at y=0 at turn 8.\n\nFrom turn 6, if I do nothing or down, I stay at y=0.\n\nBut I can go to y=1 at turn 7, then down to y=0 at turn 8.\n\nThat might be better than staying, because I make some progress.\n\nLet's see the actions.\n\nOption 1: stay low\n\na_6: S or D, so y_7=0\n\na_7: S or D, y_8=0\n\nThen from turn 8, y=0, start going up.\n\nOption 2: up then down\n\na_6: U, y_7=1\n\na_7: D, y_8=0\n\nThen same as above, but I used one U and one D, net zero, but I was at y=1 at turn 7.\n\nIn terms of progress, from turn 6 to 8, in both cases, I end at y=0 at turn 8.\n\nBut in option 2, I visited y=1 at turn 7, which is fine.\n\nNow, for min H to reach y=9, it doesn't matter, since I need to go up from y=0.\n\nBut from turn 8, I need to go to y=9.\n\nNow, turn 8: y=0\n\nI need to reach y=9 asap.\n\nBut I have to avoid dangers at T=10 and 11 for y=5,6.\n\nSo let's plan from turn 8 onwards.\n\nTurn 8: y=0\n\na_8: I can choose action.\n\nIf I go U immediately: a_8: U, turn 9: y=1\n\nThen a_9: U, turn 10: y=2\n\nBut turn 10: y=2, which is freeway 2, but at T=10, is it dangerous? Freeway 2 dangerous only at T=8, not T=10, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, all other times safe except specific.\n\nNow, continue:\n\na_9: U, turn 10: y=2 (if from y=1)\n\nTurn 9: y=1, a_9: U, then turn 10: y=2\n\nThen a_10: U, turn 11: y=3\n\na_11: U, turn 12: y=4\n\na_12: U, turn 13: y=5\n\na_13: U, turn 14: y=6\n\na_14: U, turn 15: y=7\n\na_15: U, turn 16: y=8\n\na_16: U, turn 17: y=9\n\nReached at turn 17, with 11 actions? From turn 8 to 17, 9 turns? Let's count.\n\nStart: turn 8, y=0\n\nAfter a_8: turn 9, y=1\n\na_9: turn 10, y=2\n\na_10: turn 11, y=3\n\na_11: turn 12, y=4\n\na_12: turn 13, y=5\n\na_13: turn 14, y=6\n\na_14: turn 15, y=7\n\na_15: turn 16, y=8\n\na_16: turn 17, y=9\n\nSo after 9 actions (a_8 to a_16), at turn 17, y=9.\n\nBut I have actions from t1=6.\n\nFirst, from turn 6 to 8: I need to set y_8=0.\n\nWith two actions.\n\nIf I do a_6: S, a_7: S, then y_7=0, y_8=0\n\nOr a_6: U, a_7: D, y_7=1, y_8=0\n\nIn both cases, at turn 8, y=0.\n\nThen from above, with 9 up actions, reach turn 17 y=9.\n\nBut is this minimal? H= number of actions from t1 to reach y=9 at turn t1+H.\n\nt1=6, actions a_6 to a_{6+H-1}, and at turn t1+H, y=9.\n\nHere, from above, after a_6 to a_16? a_6, a_7, then a_8 to a_16, that's 11 actions.\n\nList:\n\nActions: a_6, a_7, a_8, a_9, a_10, a_11, a_12, a_13, a_14, a_15, a_16: 11 actions, at turn 17, y=9.\n\nBut I can do better.\n\nThe dangers at T=10,11 for y=5,6.\n\nIn the above path, at turn 10, y=2, safe; turn 11, y=3, safe; but later at turn 13, y=5, turn 14, y=6.\n\nTurn 13: T=13, y=5, freeway 5, but dangerous only at T=10,11, not 13, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, turn 14, y=6, T=14, not dangerous, safe.\n\nSo the above path is safe, but slow because I started from y=0 at turn 8.\n\nBut I could be higher at turn 8.\n\nAt turn 8, I must be at y=0, but at turn 7, I could be at y=1.\n\nBut since I have to go down to y=0, I don't gain height.\n\nPerhaps I can be at y=5 or above at turn 8, but earlier we concluded y_8 must be 0 to be safe.\n\nIs that true?\n\nAt turn 8, must not be on y=1,2,3,4.\n\nSo y_8 can be 0, or 5,6,7,8, or 9.\n\nBut from turn 6, y=0, in two actions, I can only reach y up to 2.\n\ny_7: max 1 (if a_6=U)\n\ny_8: if y_7=1, a_7=U, y_8=2; but y=2 at T=8 dangerous, not allowed.\n\na_7=S, y_8=1, not allowed.\n\na_7=D, y_8=0, allowed.\n\nIf y_7=0, y_8 can be 0 or 1, but y=1 not allowed, so only y_8=0.\n\nSo indeed, from y=0 at turn 6, with two actions to turn 8, I can only be at y=0 at turn 8; I cannot reach y=5 or higher in two moves.\n\nMax I can be is y_7=1, then down to y_8=0.\n\nSo y_8 must be 0.\n\nThen from there, I need to go up.\n\nBut I can go up faster, but each move only +1.\n\nPerhaps I can reach y=9 earlier by not waiting, but I have to avoid the y=5,6 at T=10,11.\n\nIn the current path, I reach y=9 at turn 17.\n\nBut turn 17 is late; I can be faster.\n\nFor example, if I go up continuously from turn 8.\n\nBut from y=0 to y=9, min 9 actions, to turn 17.\n\nTurn 8 y=0, after 9 actions, turn 17 y=9.\n\nBut the actions start from a_8 to a_16, turn 17.\n\nNow, the dangerous times T=10 and 11 are before that.\n\nIn the path, when I reach y=5, it is at turn 13, which is after T=11, so safe.\n\nSimilarly y=6 at 14, safe.\n\nBut T=10 and 11 are turns 10 and 11.\n\nAt those turns, in my path, at turn 10, y=2, which is not 5 or 6, so safe; turn 11, y=3, not 5 or 6, safe.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nBut can I reach earlier?\n\nFor example, if I could be higher at turn 8, but I can't.\n\nPerhaps I can go up before turn 8 to some point, but I have to be at y=0 at turn 8, so I can't be higher.\n\nUnless I am on y=5 or above at turn 8, but impossible in two moves from y=0.\n\nSo I must be at y=0 at turn 8.\n\nThen the fastest to y=9 is 9 up moves, reaching turn 17.\n\nBut let's confirm the actions.\n\nFirst, from turn 6 to 8: I need y_8=0.\n\nI can choose different actions.\n\nFor example, a_6: U, then at turn 7, y=1 (safe, since T=7 not dangerous)\n\nThen a_7: D, at turn 8, y=0 (safe)\n\nOr a_6: S, a_7: S, turn 7 y=0, turn 8 y=0.\n\nThe first way, I use U and D, net zero, but I moved.\n\nFor min time, both take two turns to be at y=0 turn 8.\n\nThen from turn 8:\n\na_8: U, turn 9: y=1\n\na_9: U, turn 10: y=2\n\na_10: U, turn 11: y=3\n\na_11: U, turn 12: y=4\n\na_12: U, turn 13: y=5\n\na_13: U, turn 14: y=6\n\na_14: U, turn 15: y=7\n\na_15: U, turn 16: y=8\n\na_16: U, turn 17: y=9\n\nNow, at turn 13: T=13, y=5, freeway 5, but dangerous only at T=10,11, so T=13 safe.\n\nSimilarly, turn 14, y=6, T=14, safe.\n\ny=7 and 8 always safe.\n\nSo this works.\n\nBut H=11 actions: a_6 to a_16.\n\na_6, a_7, a_8 to a_16: that's 11 actions.\n\nIndex: actions from t=0 to H-1, with t starting from t1.\n\nThe sequence is {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}, so for t from 0 to H-1, actions at time t1 + t.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t1 + H, position y_{t1 + H}.\n\nIn this case, t1=6, after H actions, at turn 6+H, y=9.\n\nHere at turn 17, y=9, so 6+H=17, H=11.\n\nBut can I do with less than 11?\n\nFor example, if I can avoid the slowdown at turn 8.\n\nBut I have to be at y=0 at turn 8, so I lose two turns effectively.\n\nPerhaps I can be at y=9 before turn 17.\n\nMinimal from start: from y=0 turn 6, to y=9, min 9 actions, but with constraint at turn 8.\n\nWithout constraint, I could be at y=9 at turn 15: turn 6 y=0, a6 U turn7 y1, a7 U turn8 y2, but turn8 y2 dangerous, not possible.\n\nIf I could be at y=5 at turn 8, but I can't.\n\nSo I think 11 is the min for this path.\n\nBut let's see if I can reach y=9 earlier by being careful around T=10,11.\n\nFor example, if I can be on y=7 or 8 at T=10 or 11, which is safe, then go to 9.\n\nBut from turn 8 y=0, I need several moves to reach high y.\n\nAt turn 8 y=0.\n\nIf I go up fast, at turn 9 y=1, turn 10 y=2, turn 11 y=3, etc., as before.\n\nTo be at y=7 at turn 10: from turn 8 y=0, to turn 10 y=7? That requires two moves: from y=0 to y=7 in two moves? Impossible, max +1 per move, so at turn 10, max y=2 if I start from turn 8 y=0: turn 9 y=1, turn 10 y=2.\n\nSimilarly, cannot be higher.\n\nSo I must pass through lower rows at turn 10 and 11.\n\nAt turn 10, y=2 in the path, which is safe.\n\nTurn 11 y=3, safe.\n\nThen later y=5 and 6 after T=11, safe.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nBut T=10 and 11 are dangers for y=5 and 6, but in this path, I am not on y=5 or 6 at those times, so fine.\n\nPerhaps I can go slower before turn 8 to be higher, but I can't because of the danger.\n\nAnother idea: instead of going to y=0 at turn 8, I could be on y=5 or 6 or 7 or 8 at turn 8, which is safe since those rows not dangerous at T=8.\n\nFor example, y=5 at T=8: freeway 5, dangerous only at T=10,11, not T=8, so safe.\n\nSimilarly y=6,7,8 safe at T=8.\n\nBut can I reach y=5 at turn 8 from y=0 at turn 6?\n\nIn two moves: impossible.\n\nFrom turn 6 to turn 8, only two actions.\n\ny_7: after a_6, y_7 <=1\n\ny_8: after a_7, if y_7=0, y_8<=1; if y_7=1, y_8<=2 or 0.\n\nSo y_8 <=2, so I cannot be at y=5 or above at turn 8.\n\nThus, only possibilities at turn 8 are y=0,1,2, but y=1 and 2 not allowed, so must be y=0.\n\nNo choice.\n\nSo I have to lose two turns to be at y=0 at turn 8.\n\nThen proceed up.\n\nBut in the process, I can choose to go to y=1 at turn 7, then down, which might not save time, but since I have to go up later, same.\n\nNow, about T=10 and 11, in the path I have, I am at low y, so no problem.\n\nBut suppose I was at higher y, I might hit y=5 or 6 at T=10 or 11.\n\nFor example, if I could be at y=5 at turn 10, dangerous.\n\nBut in this case, I am not.\n\nNow, to confirm, let's write the sequence with minimal H.\n\nH=11 actions: from t=0 to 10, actions at t1 + t for t=0 to 10, so turns 6 to 16.\n\na_6 to a_16.\n\nAt turn 17, y=9.\n\nBut turn 17 is t1 + 11.\n\nt1=6, after H actions, at turn t1 + H = 6 + H.\n\nSet to 9.\n\nSo 6+H=17, H=11.\n\nNow, for the actions, I need to specify.\n\nFirst, for a_6 and a_7, I can choose how to get to y=0 at turn 8.\n\nFor example, one way: a_6: U, then a_7: D\n\nThen at turn 7, y=1; turn 8, y=0.\n\nOr a_6: S, a_7: S, turn 7 y=0, turn 8 y=0.\n\nThe first might be better because I don't stay, but since I go down later, it doesn't save time.\n\nI could do a_6: U, a_7: D to have movement.\n\nBut for min H, both are same.\n\nThen from a_8 to a_16 all U.\n\nBut a_16 is action at turn 16, to turn 17 y=9.\n\nIn the sequence, I need to list actions from turn t1=6.\n\nSo let's write.\n\nAlso, at turn 13, y=5, but T=13 not dangerous, safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut is there a way to reach earlier?\n\nPerhaps I can go up faster after turn 8, but I can't.\n\nAnother thought: I could go down to y=0 at turn 8, but from higher, but I can't be higher.\n\nPerhaps I can be at y=9 at turn 15 or earlier.\n\nFor example, if no danger, I can reach turn 15: turn6 y0, a6 U t7 y1, a7 U t8 y2, a8 U t9 y3, ..., up to a14 U t15 y9.\n\nBut at turn 8, y=2, which is dangerous, not possible.\n\nIf I start slower: suppose a6 S, t7 y0, then a7 U, but at t8 y1, dangerous if on y1 at t8.\n\ny=1 at t8 dangerous.\n\na6 D, same.\n\na6 S, t7 y0, a7 S, t8 y0, then I start late.\n\nThen from t8 y0, I need to go to y9, min t17.\n\na6 U, t7 y1, a7 D, t8 y0, same as before.\n\nThen from t8 y0, if I go all U: t9 y1, t10 y2, t11 y3, t12 y4, t13 y5, t14 y6, t15 y7, t16 y8, t17 y9.\n\nAt t13 y5, t=13, not dangerous; t14 y6, t=14, not dangerous.\n\nBut t=10 and t=11, I am at y=2 and y=3, not y=5 or 6, so safe.\n\nNow, can I avoid the y=5 and y=6 at all? No, I have to pass through, but after t11, it's fine.\n\nSince y=7 and 8 are always safe, I could stay there, but I need to reach y=9.\n\nAnother idea: to avoid being on y=5 or 6 at t=10 or 11, I could be there earlier or later.\n\nIn this case, I am there at t13 and 14, which is after, so fine.\n\nI could be there before t10.\n\nFor example, if I could be at y=5 at turn 9 or something.\n\nBut from turn 8 y=0, at turn 9 y=1 max, turn 10 y=2, so I cannot be at y=5 before turn 13.\n\nTurn 13 y=5 is the earliest possible from turn 8 y=0.\n\nSimilarly, y=6 at turn 14.\n\nAnd t=13 and 14 are after t=11, so no danger.\n\nt=10 and 11 are the only dangerous times.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 11.\n\nNow for the actions, I need to specify the sequence.\n\nI can choose a_6 and a_7.\n\nFor example, let's do a_6: U, so at turn 7, y=1\n\nThen a_7: D, so at turn 8, y=0\n\nThen a_8: U, turn 9 y=1\n\na_9: U, turn 10 y=2\n\na_10: U, turn 11 y=3\n\na_11: U, turn 12 y=4\n\na_12: U, turn 13 y=5\n\na_13: U, turn 14 y=6\n\na_14: U, turn 15 y=7\n\na_15: U, turn 16 y=8\n\na_16: U, turn 17 y=9\n\nNow, check collisions:\n\nTurn 6: y=0, no freeway, safe\n\nTurn 7: y=1, freeway 1, at T=7, not dangerous (only dangerous at T=8), so safe\n\nTurn 8: y=0, safe\n\nTurn 9: y=1, freeway 1, T=9, not dangerous, safe\n\nTurn 10: y=2, freeway 2, T=10, not dangerous (only T=8), safe\n\nTurn 11: y=3, freeway 3, T=11, not dangerous, safe\n\nTurn 12: y=4, freeway 4, T=12, not dangerous, safe\n\nTurn 13: y=5, freeway 5, T=13, dangerous? Freeway 5 dangerous at T=10,11, not 13, so safe\n\nTurn 14: y=6, freeway 6, T=14, not dangerous, safe\n\nTurn 15: y=7, freeway 7, always safe, no car at 0\n\nTurn 16: y=8, freeway 8, always safe\n\nTurn 17: y=9, no freeway, safe and reached.\n\nAll safe.\n\nNow, with a_6: S, a_7: S, same thing, but at turn 7 y=0, which is fine, but I didn't visit y=1 earlier, but no issue.\n\nI think with U and D, I have movement, but both work.\n\nNow for the answer, I need to list the actions.\n\nThe sequence should be for turns starting from t1=6.\n\nSo actions: a_6, a_7, a_8, ..., up to a_16, but a_16 is the last action to reach y=9 at turn 17.\n\nNumber of actions: from a_6 to a_16, that's 11 actions.\n\nt from 0 to 10, since t=0: t1+0=6, t=1: t1+1=7, ..., t=10: t1+10=16.\n\nSo H=11.\n\nIn the sequence: Turn t1: a_{t1}, etc.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let's confirm if I can reach earlier with different path.\n\nSuppose at some point I go down to avoid, but no need.\n\nFor example, around T=10,11, if I was at y=5, I could go down, but in this case I am not.\n\nAnother idea: since at turn 8 I am at y=0, and T=10 and 11 are dangers for y=5,6, if I go slower, I might be at y=4 or something at T=10, but y=4 is safe at T=10.\n\nIn the current path, I am at y=2 at T=10, fine.\n\nIf I go faster, but I can't from low.\n\nSuppose after turn 8, I go all U, but I reach y=5 at turn 13, which is late but safe.\n\nI think 11 is minimal.\n\nPerhaps I can reach y=9 at turn 15 if no danger at turn 8, but with danger, I must delay.\n\nSo I think H=11.\n\nNow for the actions, I need to output the sequence.\n\nIn the sequence above, a_6=U, a_7=D, a_8=U, ..., a_16=U.\n\nBut a_7=D, going down, but it's necessary to avoid collision at turn 8.\n\nI could do a_6=S, a_7=S, then a_8 to a_16 all U, same number.\n\nBut with U and D, it might look better, but both fine.\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 5 and 6, there are multiple cars, but we considered only the one that can cover 0.\n\nIn freeway 5, cars: (48,37,right,6) never near 0, (12,1,right,6) min x=1>0, never 0, and (-24,-35,right,6) covers 0 at T=10,11.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 6.\n\nSo correct.\n\nNow, the answer format.\n\nSo sequence:\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: D\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nThen at turn 17, y=9.\n\nActions from turn 6 to 16, 11 actions.\n\nIn the sequence, I have 11 actions.\n\nBut let's list the turns:\n\nAction at turn 6: U, to turn 7 y=1\n\nAction at turn 7: D, to turn 8 y=0\n\nAction at turn 8: U, to turn 9 y=1\n\nAction at turn 9: U, to turn 10 y=2\n\nAction at turn 10: U, to turn 11 y=3\n\nAction at turn 11: U, to turn 12 y=4\n\nAction at turn 12: U, to turn 13 y=5\n\nAction at turn 13: U, to turn 14 y=6\n\nAction at turn 14: U, to turn 15 y=7\n\nAction at turn 15: U, to turn 16 y=8\n\nAction at turn 16: U, to turn 17 y=9\n\nYes.\n\nI could have the first two actions as S and S, but U and D is fine.\n\nNow, for the box.\n\nThe answer should be:\n\n\\boxed{ Turn 6: U \\\\ Turn 7: D \\\\ Turn 8: U \\\\ Turn 9: U \\\\ Turn 10: U \\\\ Turn 11: U \\\\ Turn 12: U \\\\ Turn 13: U \\\\ Turn 14: U \\\\ Turn 15: U \\\\ Turn 16: U }\n\nBut this is 11 lines, from turn 6 to 16.\n\nIn the format, it says \\{a_{t_1 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{H-1}, so for H=11, t from 0 to 10, turns 6 to 16.\n\nAnd at turn 17, y=9.\n\nBut is there a shorter sequence?\n\nSuppose I do not go down at turn 7, but I must avoid y=1-4 at turn 8.\n\nUnless I can be on y=5 or above, impossible.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=9 in fewer than 9 up moves, but impossible.\n\nAnother thought: at turn 6, I start at y=0.\n\nIf I do nothing for several turns, but that would make H larger.\n\nFor example, if I wait at y=0 until after turn 8, but I need to go up.\n\nIn my sequence, I go to y=1 at turn 7, then back, but I still reach turn 17.\n\nIf I stay at y=0 for both turn 6 and 7: a6 S, turn7 y0; a7 S, turn8 y0.\n\nThen same as before.\n\nNo saving.\n\nPerhaps after turn 8, I can go up slower to avoid y=5 at some time, but in this case, no need.\n\nFor example, if I was to be at y=5 at turn 10, I could stay or go down, but I am not.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 11.\n\nSo the sequence as above.\n</think>\nTo reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 6\\) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\), the player must ensure they are not on freeways \\(y = 1, 2, 3,\\) or \\(4\\) at turn 8 (due to collisions), and not on freeways \\(y = 5\\) or \\(6\\) at turns 10 or 11 (due to collisions). The freeways \\(y = 7\\) and \\(8\\) are always safe at \\(x = 0\\).\n\nGiven the constraints, the player must be at \\(y = 0\\) at turn 8 to avoid collision. From turn 6 (\\(y = 0\\)), the actions are chosen as follows:\n- At turn 6, move up (U) to reach \\(y = 1\\) at turn 7. This is safe since freeway 1 is not dangerous at turn 7.\n- At turn 7, move down (D) to reach \\(y = 0\\) at turn 8, avoiding collision on freeways 1-4.\n- From turn 8 onwards, move up (U) repeatedly to reach \\(y = 9\\) as quickly as possible. The positions at turns 10 and 11 (\\(y = 2\\) and \\(y = 3\\)) are safe, as these freeways are not dangerous at those turns. Positions at \\(y = 5\\) and \\(y = 6\\) occur at turns 13 and 14, which are after the dangerous turns 10 and 11, so they are safe.\n\nThis sequence requires 11 actions (from turn 6 to turn 16) to reach \\(y = 9\\) at turn 17, which is minimal under the constraints.\n\n**Action Sequence:**\n- Turn 6: U (move to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 7)\n- Turn 7: D (move to \\(y = 0\\) at turn 8)\n- Turn 8: U (move to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 9)\n- Turn 9: U (move to \\(y = 2\\) at turn 10)\n- Turn 10: U (move to \\(y = 3\\) at turn 11)\n- Turn 11: U (move to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 12)\n- Turn 12: U (move to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 13)\n- Turn 13: U (move to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 14)\n- Turn 14: U (move to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 15)\n- Turn 15: U (move to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 16)\n- Turn 16: U (move to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 17)\n\nAll positions are safe:\n- Turn 6: \\(y = 0\\) (no freeway, safe)\n- Turn 7: \\(y = 1\\) (freeway 1, safe at turn 7)\n- Turn 8: \\(y = 0\\) (safe)\n- Turn 9: \\(y = 1\\) (freeway 1, safe at turn 9)\n- Turn 10: \\(y = 2\\) (freeway 2, safe at turn 10)\n- Turn 11: \\(y = 3\\) (freeway 3, safe at turn 11)\n- Turn 12: \\(y = 4\\) (freeway 4, safe at turn 12)\n- Turn 13: \\(y = 5\\) (freeway 5, safe at turn 13)\n- Turn 14: \\(y = 6\\) (freeway 6, safe at turn 14)\n- Turn 15: \\(y = 7\\) (freeway 7, always safe)\n- Turn 16: \\(y = 8\\) (freeway 8, always safe)\n- Turn 17: \\(y = 9\\) (reached)\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 6: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: \\text{ D} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 14: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 15: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 16: \\text{ U} }",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,1) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible without colliding with any cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t_1 = 7, and I start at y=1.\n\nFirst, I should understand how the cars move. Each car has a head and tail, and they move left or right based on their direction and speed. For left-moving cars, the span moves left as time increases, meaning the positions decrease. For right-moving cars, positions increase.\n\nCollision happens only if at the turn T, when I'm on a freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there is a car where 0 is in its span at that exact turn. Also, when I move to a new y, I'm not on that new y until the next turn, so I don't collide with cars on the new y at the current turn.\n\nI need to move up from y=1 to y=9, so I probably want to go up as fast as possible, but I have to avoid the cars.\n\nLet me list out the car states for each freeway at turn t_1=7.\n\nFreeway 1: one car, head=-24, tail=-47, direction=right, speed=24. Since it's right-moving, the span at time T is [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]? Let's see the update rule.\n\nFrom the rule:\n\nRight-moving: Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nIn this case, at t_1, head is given as -24, tail as -47, and direction right. But for right-moving, head should be greater than tail, I think. Here head=-24, tail=-47, so -24 > -47, so head is at -24, tail at -47, so the car is from -47 to -24? Let's see the span.\n\nThe span is given as (head, tail, dir, speed). For right-moving, if head is greater than tail, the car is from tail to head, so positions from low to high.\n\nIn this case, for freeway 1: head=-24, tail=-47, dir=right, speed=24. So at t_1=7, the car spans from -47 to -24? Tail is -47, head is -24, so since direction right, the front is at -24? I need to be careful with coordinates.\n\nTypically, in such grids, position 0 is the crossing point, negative left, positive right.\n\nSo for a car, tail is one end, head is the other.\n\nFor right-moving, the head is to the right, so for freeway 1, at t_1, tail at -47, head at -24, so the car occupies x from -47 to -24.\n\nThen at time T, since moving right, Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)] = [-47 + 24*(T-7), -24 + 24*(T-7)]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut collision only if at turn T, when I'm on that y, 0 is in the span.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but all cars here are right-moving, I think. Let me check.\n\nAll directions are \"right\" in this state, so all moving right.\n\nFreeway 1: one car, right, speed 24\n\nFreeway 2: one car, head=-12, tail=-47, right, speed 36? Tail=-47, head=-12, so from -47 to -12 at t_1.\n\nThen Span(T) = [-47 + 36*(T-7), -12 + 36*(T-7)]\n\nFreeway 3: same as freeway 2? Head=-12, tail=-47, right, speed 36. Identical to freeway 2?\n\nBut freeway 3 has the same car? Or is it a different car? The table says \"Cars\" for each freeway, so for freeway 3, it has one car with same parameters.\n\nSimilarly freeway 4: same, head=-12, tail=-47, right, speed 36.\n\nThen freeway 5: has three cars: (54,43,right,6), (18,7,right,6), (-18,-29,right,6)\n\nHead and tail: for first car, head=54, tail=43? 54>43, so tail=43, head=54, so from 43 to 54.\n\nSimilarly, second car: head=18, tail=7, from 7 to 18.\n\nThird car: head=-18, tail=-29, from -29 to -18.\n\nAll moving right, speed 6.\n\nFreeway 6: same as freeway 5? It has three cars with same parameters: (54,43,right,6), (18,7,right,6), (-18,-29,right,6)\n\nFreeway 7: one car, head=60, tail=49? Head=60, tail=49, so from 49 to 60, right, speed 12.\n\nSpan(T) = [49 + 12*(T-7), 60 + 12*(T-7)]\n\nFreeway 8: one car, head=52, tail=41, right, speed 4. So from 41 to 52 at t_1.\n\nSpan(T) = [41 + 4*(T-7), 52 + 4*(T-7)]\n\nNow, I start at y=1 at turn t=7.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nEach turn I can go up, down, or stay. But since I need to go up, and minimize turns, I should go up as much as possible, but avoid collisions.\n\ny from 0 to 9, and freeways y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, I assume, no cars there.\n\nThe player is on the grid, and freeways are at y=1 to 8, so at y=0 and y=9, no cars, so no collision possible there.\n\nI start at (0,1) at turn 7.\n\nI need to be at (0,9) at some turn, say turn T.\n\nThe position is always x=0, I think, since we're only moving vertically? The player position is given as (0, y_t), so x is always 0, and we move vertically.\n\nCars are on horizontal freeways, so they move horizontally, and we cross at x=0.\n\nCollision if at turn T, we are on y_T, and for that freeway, there is a car with 0 in its span at that turn.\n\nNow, since I start at y=1 at t=7, I need to check if at t=7, on freeway 1, is there a car where 0 is in span.\n\nFreeway 1 at t=7: car span from -47 to -24, so positions -47 to -24, 0 is not in [-47,-24], so no collision at start.\n\nSimilarly, I need to move to y=9.\n\nThe minimal H might be 8 turns, since from y=1 to y=9, 8 steps up, but I might need to wait or something to avoid cars.\n\nH is the number of turns, including the starting turn? Let's see the sequence.\n\nThe sequence is from t= t_1 to t_1 + H -1, with H actions, so after H turns, I am at y_{t_1 + H -1}.\n\nAt turn t_1, I start at position, and after action a_{t_1}, I move to y_{t_1 +1} at turn t_1 +1, and so on.\n\nLet me define the turns.\n\nLet t be the turn index.\n\nAt turn t, I am at position y_t.\n\nI take action a_t, which determines Δy_t, and y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nThen at turn t+1, I am at y_{t+1}, and so on.\n\nCollision is checked at the turn when I am on the freeway.\n\nSpecifically, at turn T, if I am on freeway k (y_T = k), then for that freeway, at turn T, if 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway, collision.\n\nNow, I start at turn t=7, y=1.\n\nI need to reach y=9 at some turn T.\n\nThe minimal T - 7, since from y=1 to y=9, min steps are 8 if I go up every time.\n\nBut I might have to wait or go down to avoid collisions.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway, when a car is at x=0.\n\nThat is, for each freeway, find times T when 0 is in Span(T) for some car on that freeway.\n\nSince the cars move at constant speed, we can find the intervals when 0 is occupied.\n\nFor a car, 0 is in [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)] for right-moving, or similar for left, but all right here.\n\nSet t_1 = 7.\n\nFor a right-moving car, Span(T) = [τ + s(T-7), h + s(T-7)]\n\n0 is in this interval if:\n\nτ + s(T-7) ≤ 0 ≤ h + s(T-7)\n\nSince for right-moving, τ < h usually, so the span is increasing.\n\nSo:\n\nτ + s(T-7) ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ h + s(T-7)\n\nSo:\n\nτ + s(T-7) ≤ 0 ⇒ s(T-7) ≤ -τ ⇒ T-7 ≤ -τ / s\n\nAnd 0 ≤ h + s(T-7) ⇒ s(T-7) ≥ -h ⇒ T-7 ≥ -h / s\n\nSo T-7 ≥ ceil(-h/s) ? Since T integer, we need to find integer T where this holds.\n\nSimilarly for the inequality.\n\nLet's write:\n\nT-7 ≥ -h / s\n\nand T-7 ≤ -τ / s\n\nSince τ and h could be negative, -τ and -h positive.\n\nSet Δt = T - 7, so for each car, find Δt such that:\n\n- h / s ≤ Δt ≤ -τ / s\n\nThen for that car, at times T = 7 + Δt with Δt integer in that range, 0 is occupied.\n\nThen for a freeway, if there are multiple cars, we need if any car has 0 occupied at T.\n\nNow let's do for each freeway.\n\nStart with freeway 1: one car, h=-24, τ=-47, s=24, dir=right.\n\nThen Δt min = ceil( -h / s ) = ceil( -(-24) / 24 ) = ceil(24/24) = ceil(1) =1\n\nΔt max = floor( -τ / s ) = floor( -(-47)/24 ) = floor(47/24) = floor(1.958) =1\n\nSo Δt from 1 to 1, so only at Δt=1, T=8.\n\nSo at turn T=8, if on freeway 1, collision.\n\nΔt min = ceil( -h/s ) = ceil(24/24) = ceil(1) =1\n\nΔt max = floor( -τ/s ) = floor(47/24) = floor(1.958) =1\n\nYes, Δt=1, T=8.\n\nFor other Δt, not.\n\nNow freeway 2: car with h=-12, τ=-47, s=36\n\nΔt min = ceil( -h/s ) = ceil( -(-12)/36 ) = ceil(12/36) = ceil(1/3) = ceil(0.333) =1\n\nΔt max = floor( -τ/s ) = floor( -(-47)/36 ) = floor(47/36) = floor(1.305) =1\n\nSo only at T=8, collision on freeway 2.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as freeway 2, h=-12, τ=-47, s=36, so same, collision only at T=8.\n\nFreeway 4: same, collision at T=8.\n\nNow freeway 5: has three cars.\n\nFirst car: h=54, τ=43, s=6, right\n\nΔt min = ceil( -h/s ) = ceil( -54/6 ) = ceil(-9) = -9? But T-7, so Δt can be negative, but we start from t=7, so T>=7, Δt>=0.\n\nWe care about T>=7.\n\nNow, -h/s = -54/6 = -9\n\nSince -9 <0, and Δt >=0, so the min is not binding if negative.\n\nSimilarly, Δt max = floor( -τ/s ) = floor( -43/6 ) = floor(-7.166) = -8? Again negative.\n\nThe inequality:\n\n- h/s <= Δt <= -τ/s\n\nFor first car, h=54, τ=43, s=6\n\n- h/s = -54/6 = -9\n\n- τ/s = -43/6 ≈ -7.166\n\nSo -9 <= Δt <= -7.166\n\nBut Δt >=0, and -9 <=0 <= -7.166? 0 <= -7.166 is false, so no integer Δt satisfies, since Δt >=0 and Δt <= -7.166 impossible. So this car never at x=0 for T>=7.\n\nSimilarly, second car: h=18, τ=7, s=6\n\n- h/s = -18/6 = -3\n\n- τ/s = -7/6 ≈ -1.166\n\nSo -3 <= Δt <= -1.166\n\nAgain, Δt >=0, and <= -1.166 impossible, so no.\n\nThird car: h=-18, τ=-29, s=6\n\n- h/s = -(-18)/6 = 18/6 =3\n\n- τ/s = -(-29)/6 = 29/6 ≈4.833\n\nSo Δt min = ceil( -h/s ) = ceil(3) =3\n\nΔt max = floor( -τ/s ) = floor(29/6) = floor(4.833) =4\n\nSo 3 <= Δt <=4\n\nThus at T=7+3=10 and T=7+4=11, this car is at x=0.\n\nFor freeway 5, only the third car matters for T>=7, at T=10 and 11.\n\nNow freeway 6: same as freeway 5, cars identical, so same, collision at T=10 and 11 if on freeway 6.\n\nNow freeway 7: one car, h=60, τ=49, s=12\n\n- h/s = -60/12 = -5\n\n- τ/s = -49/12 ≈ -4.083\n\nSo -5 <= Δt <= -4.083\n\nΔt >=0, no overlap, so never at x=0 for T>=7.\n\nFreeway 8: one car, h=52, τ=41, s=4\n\n- h/s = -52/4 = -13\n\n- τ/s = -41/4 = -10.25\n\nSo -13 <= Δt <= -10.25, all negative, no for T>=7.\n\nSo summary of dangerous times for each freeway:\n\n- Freeway 1: collision at T=8\n\n- Freeway 2: collision at T=8\n\n- Freeway 3: collision at T=8\n\n- Freeway 4: collision at T=8\n\n- Freeway 5: collision at T=10 and 11\n\n- Freeway 6: collision at T=10 and 11\n\n- Freeway 7: no collision\n\n- Freeway 8: no collision\n\nI start at turn 7, y=1.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\nThe freeways are from y=1 to y=8, and I need to pass through them.\n\nAt each turn, when I am on a freeway, I must not be there when it is dangerous.\n\nSince I start at y=1 at t=7, and freeway 1 is dangerous at t=8, but I might not be on it at t=8.\n\nI need to plan the sequence.\n\nLet me denote the actions: U for up, D for down, S for stay.\n\nEach action changes y by +1, -1, or 0.\n\ny must be in [0,9].\n\nI start at y=1, t=7.\n\nI want to reach y=9 asap.\n\nMinimal steps: from y=1 to y=9, 8 steps up, so in 8 turns, I could be at y=9 at turn 15? Let's see the turn indices.\n\nAt turn t, I am at y_t.\n\nAfter action a_t, I go to y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nSo at turn 7, y=1.\n\nAfter a_7, at turn 8, y= y_7 + Δy_7.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 9, y= y_8 + Δy_8, and so on.\n\nTo reach y=9, I need some turn T where y_T =9.\n\nThe earliest possible: if I go up every turn, from t=7 to t=14, I go up 7 times? From t=7 to t=8, y from 1 to 2; t=8 to t=9, to 3; ... up to t=14 to t=15, y from 8 to 9? Let's list:\n\nTurn t | y_t after action? At turn t, I am at y_t.\n\nTurn 7: y=1\n\nAfter a_7, at turn 8: y=1 + Δy_7\n\nIf a_7=U, Δy=+1, so turn 8 y=2\n\nIf a_7=S, y=1, etc.\n\nThen at turn 8, after a_8, turn 9 y= y_8 + Δy_8\n\nAnd so on.\n\nTo go from y=1 to y=9, min turns: if I go up every step, from turn 7 to turn 8: y=2, turn 9: y=3, ..., turn 14: y=8, turn 15: y=9. So from turn 7 to turn 15, that's 8 actions: a_7 to a_14, and at turn 15, y=9.\n\nNumber of turns: from t=7 to t=15, that's 9 turns, but actions from t=7 to t=14, 8 actions.\n\nH is the number of turns in the sequence, from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, so for H actions, turns t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nAt turn t_1 + H -1, y=9.\n\nIn min case, H=8, turns 7 to 14, at turn 14 y=9? Let's see:\n\nStart turn 7: y=1\n\nAfter a_7 (U), turn 8: y=2\n\na_8 (U), turn 9: y=3\n\n...\n\na_13 (U), turn 14: y=8? From turn 7 y=1, after first U, turn 8 y=2, after second U turn 9 y=3, ..., after k-th U, turn (7+k) y=1+k.\n\nAfter 7 U's? At turn 7 y=1, after one U at turn 8 y=2, after two U at turn 9 y=3, ..., after seven U at turn 14 y=8, then at turn 14, if I do another U, to turn 15 y=9.\n\nBut at turn 14, I am at y=8, not yet 9.\n\nTo be at y=9 at turn T, I need to have arrived by action at turn T-1.\n\nSince y_T = y_{T-1} + Δy_{T-1}\n\nSo for y_T=9, it depends on previous.\n\nThe earliest turn to be at y=9 is turn 15, with a_7 to a_14 all U, but at turn 15 y=9.\n\nBut we need to avoid collisions during the path.\n\nWith collisions, I might need to take more turns.\n\nNow, the dangerous points:\n\nFreeways 1 to 4 all have collision at t=8, meaning at turn 8, if I am on y=1,2,3, or 4, I collide because for each, at t=8, 0 is occupied.\n\nFreeway 1: y=1, dangerous at t=8\n\nFreeway 2: y=2, dangerous at t=8\n\nFreeway 3: y=3, dangerous at t=8\n\nFreeway 4: y=4, dangerous at t=8\n\nFreeway 5: y=5, dangerous at t=10 and 11\n\nFreeway 6: y=6, dangerous at t=10 and 11\n\nFreeway 7 and 8 safe.\n\nAt turn t=8, if I am on y=1,2,3, or 4, I collide.\n\nI start at t=7, y=1.\n\nAt t=7, I am on y=1, but freeway 1 is not dangerous at t=7, as we saw earlier, only at t=8.\n\nSo at t=7, safe.\n\nNow, I need to not be on y=1,2,3,4 at turn t=8.\n\nBecause if I am on any of these at t=8, collision.\n\nSimilarly, at other times.\n\nFirst, for t=8, I must not be on y=1,2,3,4.\n\nThat means, at turn 8, y_8 must not be in {1,2,3,4}.\n\nSince y must be between 0 and 9, so y_8 must be 0, or 5,6,7,8,9.\n\nBut I start at y=1 at t=7.\n\nAt t=7, I take action a_7.\n\nIf a_7 = U, then at turn 8, y=2\n\nIf a_7 = S, at turn 8, y=1\n\nIf a_7 = D, at turn 8, y=0\n\nBut if I go to y=2 or y=1 at t=8, I collide, since y=1 or 2 are dangerous at t=8.\n\ny=1 is freeway 1, dangerous at t=8; y=2 is freeway 2, dangerous at t=8.\n\nSimilarly, if I stay, y=1 at t=8, collide.\n\nIf I go down, to y=0 at t=8, which is safe, since no freeway.\n\nBut y=0 is below, and I need to go up, so it might cost extra turns.\n\nIf I go up to y=2, but at t=8, y=2 is dangerous, collide.\n\nSo the only safe choice at t=7 is to go down to y=0.\n\na_7 = D, then at turn 8, y=0.\n\nNow, at turn 8, y=0, safe.\n\nNow, I need to go up from here.\n\nBut at turn 8, I am at y=0.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nAlso, later there are dangers at t=10 and 11 for y=5 and 6.\n\nFirst, let's get past t=8.\n\nAt turn 8, y=0.\n\nI take action a_8.\n\nIf I go up, to y=1 at turn 9.\n\nBut at turn 9, what about the freeways?\n\nt=9 is not dangerous for any freeway except possibly later.\n\nAt t=9, for freeway 1: earlier we had only danger at t=8, not other times.\n\nSimilarly for others, only specific times.\n\nFreeway 1: danger only at t=8, so at t=9, no danger on y=1.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2,3,4 only danger at t=8.\n\nFreeway 5 and 6 danger at t=10,11.\n\nAt t=9, all freeways are safe, I think.\n\nConfirm:\n\nFor freeway 1: car only at x=0 at t=8, not before or after for T>=7.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nAt t=9, no car at x=0 on any freeway.\n\nSo if at turn 9, I am on y=1, it should be safe.\n\nSimilarly for other y.\n\nNow back to turn 8: y=0.\n\nI can go up to y=1 at turn 9 with a_8=U.\n\nThen at turn 9, y=1.\n\nNow, from here, I need to go to y=9.\n\nBut there is danger at t=10 and 11 for y=5 and y=6.\n\nFreeway 5 (y=5) dangerous at t=10 and 11.\n\nFreeway 6 (y=6) dangerous at t=10 and 11.\n\nI need to not be on y=5 at t=10 or t=11, and not on y=6 at t=10 or t=11.\n\nAt turn 9, I am at y=1.\n\nI want to reach y=9 asap.\n\nMinimal from here: if I go up every turn, from y=1 at t=9.\n\na_9=U, turn 10 y=2\n\na_10=U, turn 11 y=3\n\na_11=U, turn 12 y=4\n\na_12=U, turn 13 y=5\n\nBut at turn 13 y=5, which is freeway 5, and danger at t=10 and 11, but t=13 is later, so safe? Danger only at t=10,11 for y=5.\n\nt=13 is fine.\n\nSimilarly, a_13=U, turn 14 y=6\n\nBut y=6 dangerous at t=10,11, not at t=14.\n\nThen a_14=U, turn 15 y=7\n\na_15=U, turn 16 y=8\n\na_16=U, turn 17 y=9\n\nBut this is slow, and I started from t=9 at y=1.\n\nBut earlier I had to go down to y=0 at t=8, so I lost time.\n\nAt turn 9 y=1, I can go faster.\n\nFrom turn 9 y=1:\n\n- If a_9=U, turn 10 y=2\n\n- a_10=U, turn 11 y=3\n\n- a_11=U, turn 12 y=4\n\n- a_12=U, turn 13 y=5\n\n- a_13=U, turn 14 y=6\n\n- a_14=U, turn 15 y=7\n\n- a_15=U, turn 16 y=8\n\n- a_16=U, turn 17 y=9\n\nAt turn 17 y=9, reached.\n\nBut H would be from t=7 to t=17, that's 11 turns? Turns: t=7 to t=17, 11 turns, but the sequence has H actions from t=7 to t=7+H-1.\n\nAt turn 7+H-1, y=9.\n\nHere turn 17, so 7 + H -1 =17, so H=11.\n\nBut I think I can do better.\n\nSince at t=10 and 11, y=5 and y=6 are dangerous, I need to avoid being on them at those times.\n\nIn the above, at t=10, I am at y=2, which is fine; t=11 at y=3, fine; not on y=5 or 6.\n\nSo no problem, but it takes many turns.\n\nPerhaps I can go faster from the beginning.\n\nAt t=7, instead of going down, I could go up, but to y=2 at t=8, which is dangerous, so I cannot.\n\nUnless I can skip the dangerous freeways at dangerous times.\n\nAnother idea: at t=7, I stay, but if I stay, at t=8 y=1, which is dangerous, collide.\n\nOr go down to y=0, as I did.\n\nBut going down costs a turn.\n\nPerhaps I can go up later.\n\nBut I need to be at y=9.\n\nAnother thought: since freeways 1-4 are only dangerous at t=8, and after that safe, I can be on them at other times.\n\nIn particular, at t=9, y=1 is safe, as we said.\n\nNow, to save time, from t=7, if I go down to y=0 at t=8, then at t=8 I go up to y=1 at t=9, but that took two turns to be at y=1 at t=9, whereas at t=7 I was at y=1.\n\nSo I wasted one turn.\n\nFrom t=9 y=1, I can go up faster to catch up.\n\nFor example, from y=1 at t=9, I can go to y=2 at t=10, but at t=10, y=5 and 6 are dangerous, but y=2 is fine.\n\nThen to y=3 at t=11, y=3 is fine at t=11.\n\nThen to y=4 at t=12, y=4 safe.\n\nThen to y=5 at t=13, y=5 safe since danger only t=10,11.\n\nSimilarly to y=6 at t=14, safe.\n\nThen to y=7 at t=15, y=8 at t=16, y=9 at t=17, same as before.\n\nBut to reach y=9 faster, I need to increase y faster, but I can only change by 1 per turn, so I have to take at least 8 steps up from y=1 to y=9.\n\nFrom y=1 to y=9, min 8 up actions.\n\nThe number of turns depends on when I start.\n\nAt t=7, y=1.\n\nIf I go up immediately, but I cannot because at t=8, y=2 is dangerous if I go up, or y=1 dangerous if stay.\n\nOnly down is safe.\n\nSo I must go down to y=0 at t=8.\n\nThen at t=8, y=0.\n\nNow from y=0, I can go up to y=1 at t=9.\n\nBut from t=7 to t=9, I am still at y=1, but at turn t=9.\n\nAt t=7 y=1, at t=8 y=0, at t=9 y=1, so net no progress, but I used two turns to be back at y=1.\n\nThen from t=9 y=1, I need 8 up actions to reach y=9 at turn 17.\n\nBut let's list the turns:\n\nTurn 7: y=1\n\na_7 = D, so Δy = -1, turn 8: y=0\n\na_8 = U, turn 9: y=1\n\nNow at turn 9, y=1, same as start.\n\nThen a_9 = U, turn 10: y=2\n\na_10 = U, turn 11: y=3\n\na_11 = U, turn 12: y=4\n\na_12 = U, turn 13: y=5\n\na_13 = U, turn 14: y=6\n\na_14 = U, turn 15: y=7\n\na_15 = U, turn 16: y=8\n\na_16 = U, turn 17: y=9\n\nSo at turn 17, y=9, with actions from t=7 to t=16, 10 actions, H=10, since turns t=7 to t=16, 10 turns, at turn 16, y=8? No.\n\nAt turn 16, after a_15=U, from y=7 at t=15 to y=8 at t=16.\n\nThen a_16=U, turn 17 y=9.\n\nSo at turn 17, y=9.\n\nThe sequence has actions from t=7 to t=7+H-1, and at turn t=7+H-1, y=9.\n\nSo turn 17 = 7 + H -1, so 7+H-1=17, H=11.\n\nTurns: t=7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17: 11 turns.\n\nActions: a_7 to a_16, 10 actions? Confusion.\n\nDefine: the action at time t determines the move to next position.\n\nAt turn t, I am at y_t.\n\nI take action a_t, which determines Δy_t, and y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nThen at turn t+1, I am at y_{t+1}.\n\nThe sequence of actions for H turns: actions at t = t_1, t_1+1, ..., t_1 + H -1.\n\nAfter these H actions, at turn t_1 + H, I am at y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nBut we need y_{t_1 + H} =9? No.\n\nThe problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\", and \"at turn t_1 + H -1, y_{t_1 + H -1} =9\".\n\nLet's read:\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} such that y_{t_1 + H -1} =9\"\n\nSo the actions are taken at times: t = t_1 + t for t=0 to H-1, so times t_1, t_1+1, ..., t_1 + H -1.\n\nAfter taking these actions, at the next turn, turn t_1 + H, but no.\n\nAfter action at time t, I move to y at turn t+1.\n\nSo after the last action at time t_1 + H -1, I move to y at turn (t_1 + H -1) +1 = t_1 + H.\n\nBut the state at turn t_1 + H -1 is before the action, I think.\n\nLet's clarify the timing.\n\nAt the beginning of turn t, I am at position y_t.\n\nThen I take action a_t.\n\nThen, based on a_t, I move to y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nThen at turn t+1, I am at y_{t+1}.\n\nFor the sequence, at turn t_1, I start at y_{t_1}.\n\nI take action a_{t_1}, which causes me to be at y_{t_1 +1} at turn t_1 +1.\n\nThen at turn t_1 +1, I take action a_{t_1 +1}, go to y_{t_1 +2}, and so on, up to taking action a_{t_1 + H -1}, which causes me to be at y_{t_1 + H} at turn t_1 + H.\n\nBut we need y_{t_1 + H -1} =9? That can't be right.\n\nThe problem says: \"at turn t_1 + H -1, y_{t_1 + H -1} =9\"\n\nBut at turn t_1 + H -1, I am at position y_{t_1 + H -1}, and I take action a_{t_1 + H -1}, then go to y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nSo if y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, that means I am already at 9 at that turn, before taking the action.\n\nBut I need to reach (0,9), so being at 9 at turn t_1 + H -1 is fine, but I may take an action or not.\n\nIn the sequence, the actions are from t= t_1 to t_1 + H -1, and at turn t_1 + H -1, I am at y=9.\n\nFor example, if I am at y=9 at turn T, then for the sequence ending at that turn, H is such that t_1 + H -1 = T.\n\nIn the min case without obstacles, at turn 7 y=1, after actions U at t=7 to t=14, at turn 15 y=9, so T=15, t_1 + H -1 =15, t_1=7, so 7 + H -1=15, H=9.\n\nActions from t=7 to t=7+8=15? t from t_1 to t_1+H-1, so for H=9, actions at t=7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14, and at turn t=14, y=8, then after a_14=U, turn 15 y=9.\n\nBut at turn t=14, y=8, not 9.\n\nThe state at turn t_1 + H -1 is y_{t_1 + H -1}, which for H=9, turn 7+8=15? t_1 + H -1 =7 +9 -1=15, turn 15 y=9.\n\nIn the sequence with actions at t=7 to t=14 (8 actions), at turn 15 y=9.\n\nBut turn t=15 is not in the action sequence; the last action is at t=14.\n\nAnd at turn t=15, I am at y=9.\n\nBut the problem says \"at turn t_1 + H -1, y_{t_1 + H -1} =9\", so for this, at turn 15, y=9, so t_1 + H -1 =15, 7+H-1=15, H=9.\n\nH is the number of turns in the sequence, meaning H actions or H turns including the start?\n\nThe sequence has H actions: from t=0 to H-1 offset from t_1, so H actions at times t_1 to t_1+H-1.\n\nThen at turn t_1 + H, y= y_{t_1 + H} =9, but the problem says at turn t_1 + H -1, y=9.\n\nI think there's inconsistency.\n\nRead carefully:\n\n\"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" so for t from 0 to H-1, actions at times t_1 +0, t_1+1, ..., t_1 + H-1.\n\n\"to reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1\"\n\n\"at turn t_1 + H -1, y_{t_1 + H -1} =9\"\n\nBut at turn t_1 + H -1, I am at y_{t_1 + H -1}, and I take action a_{t_1 + H -1}, which affects y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nSo if y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, that means I am at 9 before taking the action at that turn.\n\nThen I take an action, which might move me away, but the position is at the turn before action.\n\nThe collision is checked at the turn when I am on the freeway, before action or after? The problem says \"collision occurs at turn T only if 0 in Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T\", and \"at turn T, you are on freeway y_T\".\n\nSo at the beginning of turn T, I am at y_T, and collision is checked based on that.\n\nThen I take action a_T, move to y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nFor reaching (0,9) at turn T, it means at the start of turn T, I am at (0,9).\n\nThen for the sequence, we want at turn t_1 + H -1, I am at (0,9).\n\nIn the action sequence, actions from t=t_1 to t=t_1 + H -1 are taken, but the position at turn t_1 + H -1 is before any action at that turn.\n\nLet's clarify with an example.\n\nSuppose at turn 7, I am at y=1.\n\nIf I take no action, but I have to take actions.\n\nSuppose I take action S at t=7, then at turn 8, I am still at y=1 (since Δy=0).\n\nThen if I take U at t=8, at turn 9 y=2, etc.\n\nBut for reaching, if at some turn T, I am at y=9, then for the sequence ending with me at y=9 at turn T, the actions before that brought me to y=9 at turn T.\n\nThe last action that affected position was at turn T-1, which set y_T.\n\nFor example, to be at y=9 at turn T, that means that action at turn T-1 caused y_T = y_{T-1} + Δy_{T-1} =9.\n\nSo the action at turn T-1 is part of the sequence.\n\nIn the sequence for H turns, actions at t=t_1 to t_1+H-1, the position at turn t_1+H is y_{t_1+H} = y_{t_1} + sum of Δy from t=t_1 to t_1+H-1.\n\nBut we need y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\ny_{t_1 + H -1} is the position at turn t_1+H-1, which is set by action at turn t_1+H-2.\n\nI think I'm confusing myself.\n\nLet's look at the problem statement:\n\n\"at turn t_1 + H -1, y_{t_1 + H -1} =9\"\n\nAnd the actions are for t from t_1 to t_1+H-1.\n\nAt turn t_1 + H -1, I am at y_{t_1 + H -1}, and I take action a_{t_1 + H -1}, which determines y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nBut for the position to be 9 at turn t_1 + H -1, it means that before taking a_{t_1 + H -1}, I am at 9.\n\nThen I may take an action, but the reaching is at that turn.\n\nFor collision, at each turn T, when I am at y_T, it is checked for collision.\n\nSo for the sequence, we have actions from t=t_1 to t=t_1+H-1, and at turn t= t_1 + H -1, I am at y=9.\n\nFor example, if I am at y=9 at turn T, then for the sequence, T = t_1 + H -1, so H = T - t_1 +1.\n\nIn min case, t_1=7, if I can be at y=9 at turn 15, then H=15-7+1=9.\n\nIf at turn 14 y=9, then H=14-7+1=8.\n\nBut to be at y=9 at turn 14, from y=1 at turn 7, I need to increase by 8 in 7 turns, so possible only if I go up every turn from t=7 to t=13, but at turn 7 y=1, a_7=U, turn 8 y=2, a_8=U, turn 9 y=3, ..., a_13=U, turn 14 y=8, then to be at y=9 at turn 14, I need y_14=9, so from turn 13 y=7, a_13=U to y=8 at turn 14? No.\n\nAt turn 13, y=7 (after previous actions), a_13=U, then turn 14 y=8.\n\nTo have y_14=9, I need to be at y=8 at turn 13 and take U, but at turn 14 y=9.\n\nBut at turn 14, I am at y=9.\n\nSo the earliest to be at y=9 is turn 15 with all up from t=7.\n\nAt turn 15 y=9.\n\nH=9 for that.\n\nBack to the problem.\n\nI start at turn 7 y=1.\n\nDue to danger at t=8 on y=1-4, I must not be on y=1,2,3,4 at turn 8.\n\nSo at turn 8, y_8 must be 0 or 5-9.\n\nFrom y=1 at turn 7, with one action, I can go to y=0, or y=2, or y=1.\n\ny=1 and y=2 are dangerous at t=8, so only safe is to go to y=0 at turn 8 with a_7=D.\n\nThen at turn 8, y=0.\n\nFrom here, I can go to y=1 at turn 9 with a_8=U.\n\nAt turn 9, y=1, safe.\n\nNow, I need to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nThe danger is at t=10 and 11 for y=5 and y=6.\n\nI need to not be on y=5 at t=10 or t=11, and not on y=6 at t=10 or t=11.\n\nAt turn 9, I am at y=1.\n\nI can go up.\n\nBut to save time, I can go up faster, but I can only change by 1 per turn.\n\nThe position at turn 10: from y=1 at t=9, if a_9=U, y=2 at t=10.\n\nSimilarly, at t=10, y=2 is safe.\n\nIf I go up again, a_10=U, turn 11 y=3, safe.\n\na_11=U, turn 12 y=4, safe.\n\na_12=U, turn 13 y=5.\n\nNow at turn 13, y=5, and danger at t=10,11, not 13, so safe.\n\na_13=U, turn 14 y=6, danger at t=10,11, not 14, safe.\n\na_14=U, turn 15 y=7\n\na_15=U, turn 16 y=8\n\na_16=U, turn 17 y=9\n\nAt turn 17 y=9, so for the sequence, at turn t_1 + H -1 =17, t_1=7, so 7+H-1=17, H=11.\n\nBut I can be at y=9 earlier if I can avoid the danger without going down.\n\nFor example, at turn 9 y=1, instead of going directly up, I could go to higher y faster, but I can't.\n\nOr, since the danger is at t=10,11 for y=5 and 6, I can be on y=5 or 6 at other times.\n\nBut in the path above, I am not on y=5 or 6 at t=10 or 11, so it's fine, but slow.\n\nTo reach faster, I need to be at a higher y at earlier turns.\n\nFor example, from turn 7, I go down to y=0 at turn 8.\n\nThen at turn 8, instead of going up to y=1, I could go up multiple times, but I can only do one action per turn.\n\nAt turn 8, y=0, I take a_8.\n\nIf a_8=U, to y=1 at turn 9.\n\nIf a_8=S, stay at y=0, but that wastes time.\n\nSo better to go up.\n\nBut y=0 to y=1.\n\nThen from there.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=5 or 6 before t=10 or after t=11 to avoid.\n\nBut let's list the positions over time.\n\nI want to be at y=9 at turn T, with T min.\n\nFrom y=1 at t=7, to y=9, min T=15 with all up.\n\nBut with obstacles, later.\n\nBut at t=8, I am forced to be at y=0, so I start from lower position.\n\nAt turn 8, y=0.\n\nFrom y=0 at turn 8, to y=9, min turns: if all up, turn 9 y=1, turn 10 y=2, ..., turn 16 y=8, turn 17 y=9, so at turn 17 y=9.\n\nSame as before.\n\nBut with the danger at t=10,11 for y=5,6, in this path, at t=10 y=2, t=11 y=3, not on 5 or 6, so no issue, but still turn 17.\n\nTo reach earlier, I need to be at higher y at turn 8.\n\nAt turn 8, from y=1 at turn 7, only choices are y=0,1,2 at turn 8.\n\ny=1 and 2 dangerous, so only y=0.\n\nSo I cannot be higher at turn 8.\n\nSo the earliest I can be at y=9 is turn 17.\n\nBut let's see if I can be at y=9 at turn 16 or earlier.\n\nFor example, if I am at y=8 at turn 15, then a_15=U, turn 16 y=9.\n\nTo be at y=8 at turn 15, from y=1 at turn 7, I need +7 in 8 turns, from turn 7 to turn 15 is 8 turns, position from y=1 to y=8, which requires 7 up actions, so possible if I go up 7 times in 8 turns, meaning one stay or down, but I can't because of the danger at t=8.\n\nFrom turn 7 y=1, to turn 15 y=8, that's 8 turns: turn 7 to turn 15.\n\nAt turn 7 y=1, after actions at turn 7 to 14, at turn 15 y=8.\n\nTo go from y=1 to y=8 in 8 steps, I need 7 up and one other, but the other must be stay or down, which would make it slower or same, but with danger, I have to go down at t=7.\n\nIf I go down at t=7 to y=0 at turn 8, then to be at y=8 at turn 15, from turn 8 y=0 to turn 15 y=8, 7 turns, from y=0 to y=8, min 8 steps, impossible in 7 turns. So I cannot be at y=8 at turn 15.\n\nEarliest at y=8 is turn 16 from the down path.\n\nTurn 16 y=8 as above.\n\nThen turn 17 y=9.\n\nSo H=11 seems necessary.\n\nBut let's see if I can avoid the down at the beginning by waiting or something.\n\nAt turn 7, if I stay, a_7=S, then at turn 8 y=1, which is dangerous, collision, not allowed.\n\nOr go up, to y=2 at turn 8, dangerous.\n\nOnly down is safe.\n\nSo I must go down.\n\nThen at turn 8, y=0, I can go up immediately.\n\nBut still, the path takes to turn 17.\n\nNow, with the danger at t=10,11 for y=5,6, in this path I am not affected, but if I were to be on y=5 or 6 at t=10 or 11, I would have to avoid, but in this case I am not, so no problem.\n\nSo the minimal H is 11.\n\nBut let's confirm the actions.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 7: a_7 = D  (from y=1 to y=0 at turn 8)\n\nTurn 8: a_8 = U  (from y=0 to y=1 at turn 9)\n\nTurn 9: a_9 = U  (y=1 to y=2 at turn 10)\n\nTurn 10: a_10 = U (y=2 to y=3 at turn 11)\n\nTurn 11: a_11 = U (y=3 to y=4 at turn 12)\n\nTurn 12: a_12 = U (y=4 to y=5 at turn 13)\n\nTurn 13: a_13 = U (y=5 to y=6 at turn 14)\n\nTurn 14: a_14 = U (y=6 to y=7 at turn 15)\n\nTurn 15: a_15 = U (y=7 to y=8 at turn 16)\n\nTurn 16: a_16 = U (y=8 to y=9 at turn 17)\n\nAt turn 17, y=9.\n\nNow, at turn t_1 + H -1 =7 + H -1 =17, so H-1=10, H=11.\n\nThe sequence has actions from t=7 to t=7+H-1=7+10=16? t from t_1 to t_1+H-1.\n\nFor H=11, actions at t=7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16.\n\nAt turn t=7+11-1=17, y=9.\n\nYes.\n\nIn the sequence, for turn 17, no action, but the position is at turn 17.\n\nNow, check for collisions:\n\nAt turn 8: y=0, not on freeway, safe.\n\nTurn 9: y=1, freeway 1, at t=9, not dangerous (only t=8 dangerous), so safe.\n\nTurn 10: y=2, freeway 2, at t=10, not dangerous (only t=8), safe.\n\nSimilarly turn 11: y=3, freeway 3, safe.\n\nTurn 12: y=4, freeway 4, safe.\n\nTurn 13: y=5, freeway 5, at t=13, not dangerous (danger t=10,11), safe.\n\nTurn 14: y=6, freeway 6, at t=14, not dangerous, safe.\n\nTurn 15: y=7, freeway 7, no danger, safe.\n\nTurn 16: y=8, freeway 8, no danger, safe.\n\nTurn 17: y=9, no freeway, safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nBut is there a way to do it faster?\n\nFor example, at turn 8, y=0, instead of going up immediately, but going up is best.\n\nOr, to avoid the y=5,6 danger, but I don't need to since I pass later.\n\nSuppose I want to be on y=5 at a safe time.\n\nSafe times for y=5 are all except t=10,11.\n\nSimilarly for y=6.\n\nIn the above, I am on y=5 at t=13, safe.\n\nBut to reach y=9 earlier, I need to start from higher y or move faster, which I can't.\n\nAnother idea: at turn 7, go down to y=0.\n\nThen at turn 8, y=0, I can go up to y=1 at turn 9.\n\nBut same as before.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=5 directly from lower, but no.\n\nOr, since at turn 9, I am at y=1, and danger at t=10,11 for y=5,6, if I could be at y=5 before t=10 or after, but from y=1 at t=9, to y=5, I need 4 up actions.\n\nIf I go up at t=9,10,11,12, then at turn 13 y=5, as before.\n\nIf I go up faster, I can't.\n\nAt turn 9 y=1, if I do nothing, but that wastes time.\n\nSo I think 11 is minimal.\n\nBut let's see the car on freeway 5 and 6, danger at t=10,11.\n\nAt t=10 and 11, if I am on y=5 or 6, collision.\n\nBut in my path, I am not.\n\nSuppose at turn 9 y=1, I go up to y=2 at turn 10.\n\nThen at turn 10, I am at y=2, safe.\n\nNow, if I go up again to y=3 at turn 11, safe.\n\nThen to y=4 at turn 12.\n\nThen to y=5 at turn 13, safe.\n\nSame.\n\nIf at turn 10, I stay at y=2 or something, but that delays.\n\nOr, to avoid being on y=6 at t=14, but no danger.\n\nAnother thought: freeway 7 and 8 have no danger, so I can be on them anytime.\n\nBut I need to pass through all.\n\nPerhaps I can skip some levels by going faster, but I can't.\n\nOr, since from y=0 to y=9, I can go up continuously.\n\nBut with the initial down, it costs.\n\nPerhaps I don't need to go down if I can be on y=5 at turn 8, but impossible.\n\nAt turn 8, I can only be at y=0,1,2 from start, but 1 and 2 dangerous, so only y=0.\n\nSo I think H=11 is the best.\n\nBut let's confirm the answer format.\n\nThe sequence should be for turns starting from t_1=7.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 7: D\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nAnd at turn 17, y=9.\n\nBut in the sequence, actions up to turn 16.\n\nIn the box, it should be:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 7: D\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: U\nTurn 16: U\n}\n\nBut H=10 actions? From t=7 to t=16, that's 10 actions.\n\nAt turn t_1 + H -1 =7 + H -1.\n\nAfter actions, at turn 7+H, y=9, but we need at turn t_1+H-1 y=9.\n\nIn this case, at turn 16, after action a_16? Let's see.\n\nAfter action at turn 16, at turn 17 y=9.\n\nBut at turn 16, I am at y=8, not 9.\n\nIn the sequence above, at turn 16, y=8, I take U, go to y=9 at turn 17.\n\nBut we need y_{t_1+H-1} =9.\n\nFor turn 17, t_1+H-1=17, 7+H-1=17, H=11.\n\nSo the sequence must include an action at turn 16 that sets y_17=9, but at turn 16, I am at y=8.\n\nTo be at y=9 at turn 16, for example.\n\nIs it possible to be at y=9 at turn 16?\n\nFrom y=1 at turn 7, to y=9 at turn 16, that's 9 turns from turn 7 to turn 16.\n\nPositions: turn 7 y=1, after 8 actions to turn 16.\n\nFrom turn 7 to turn 16, 9 states.\n\nTo go from y=1 to y=9 in 8 steps (actions from t=7 to t=14), at turn 15 y=9.\n\nAt turn 15 y=9.\n\nThen t_1+H-1=15, 7+H-1=15, H=9.\n\nBut with obstacles, I cannot reach by turn 15 because of the down at start.\n\nWith down at t=7, I am at y=0 at turn 8, then to y=9 at turn 16 min, at turn 16 y=9? From turn 8 y=0, to turn 16 y=9, 8 turns, from y=0 to y=9 in 8 actions, possible with all up: turn 8 y=0, a_8=U turn 9 y=1, ..., a_15=U turn 16 y=9.\n\nYes.\n\nIn this case, at turn 16 y=9.\n\nThen t_1+H-1=16, 7+H-1=16, H=10.\n\nActions from t=7 to t=7+10-1=16? t_1 to t_1+H-1.\n\nFor H=10, actions at t=7 to t=16? t_1 + H -1 =7+10-1=16.\n\nActions at t=7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16.\n\nBut at turn 16, I am at y=9, and I take action a_16, but if I take action, I might move, but the position at turn 16 is before action.\n\nIn the sequence, action at turn 16 is taken, but for the position to be 9 at turn 16, it must be that from previous, I arrived at y=9 at turn 16.\n\nFor example, if at turn 15 I am at y=8, and I take U at t=15, then at turn 16 y=9.\n\nThen at turn 16, I am at y=9.\n\nThen I take a_16, which could be S or something, but I don't need to move, so I can take S or U, but since I am already at 9, I can take S.\n\nIn the sequence for H=10, actions at t=7 to t=16, and at turn 16 y=9.\n\nNow, with the down path.\n\nStart: turn 7 y=1\n\na_7 = D, so at turn 8 y=0\n\na_8 = U, turn 9 y=1\n\na_9 = U, turn 10 y=2\n\na_10 = U, turn 11 y=3\n\na_11 = U, turn 12 y=4\n\na_12 = U, turn 13 y=5\n\na_13 = U, turn 14 y=6\n\na_14 = U, turn 15 y=7\n\na_15 = U, turn 16 y=8\n\nNot y=9.\n\nTo have y=9 at turn 16, I need at turn 15 y=8, and a_15=U.\n\nBut in the above, at turn 15 y=7, after a_14=U from y=6.\n\nTo be at y=8 at turn 15, I need to be faster earlier.\n\nBut from turn 8 y=0, to turn 15 y=8, that's 7 turns: turn 8 to 15, 8 states? Turn 8 y=0, after actions to turn 15.\n\nActions from t=8 to t=14, 7 actions, to go from y=0 to y=8? Min 8 actions needed, impossible in 7 actions.\n\nSo I cannot be at y=8 at turn 15 from y=0 at turn 8.\n\nThus, at turn 16 y=8 as above, then a_16=U to turn 17 y=9.\n\nSo cannot reach y=9 at turn 16.\n\nEarliest turn 17.\n\nThus H=11.\n\nSo the sequence is as I have.\n\nBut in the sequence, for turn 16, I take U to go to y=9 at turn 17.\n\nBut at turn 16, I am at y=8.\n\nIn the answer, it should include the actions to reach.\n\nFor the box:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 7: D\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: U\nTurn 16: U\n}\n\nWith H=10 actions? But this brings to y=9 at turn 17.\n\nAnd at turn t_1 + H -1 =7 + H -1.\n\nIf H=10, 7+10-1=16, but at turn 16, y=8, not 9.\n\nContradiction.\n\nI think I have a mistake.\n\nSet T as the turn when y_T=9.\n\nThen the actions to reach there are from t=7 to t=T-1.\n\nNumber of actions: from t=7 to t=T-1, that's (T-1) - 7 +1 = T-7 actions.\n\nThen for the sequence, H is the number of actions, from t=7 to t_1+H-1.\n\nSet t_1+H-1 = last action time.\n\nThen after last action, at turn t_1+H, y=9.\n\nBut we need y at turn t_1+H-1=9.\n\nPerhaps for this problem, since it says \"at turn t_1+H-1, y=9\", it means that at that turn, before action, I am at 9.\n\nIn that case, for T=17, y=9 at turn 17, so t_1+H-1=17, 7+H-1=17, H=11.\n\nThe actions are from t=7 to t=16 (10 actions), but H=11, so actions from t=7 to t=7+11-1=17.\n\nBut at turn 17, if I am at y=9, I don't need to take action, but the sequence includes action at turn 17.\n\nIf I am at y=9 at turn 17, and I take action a_17, it might move me away, but the position is at the turn.\n\nThe problem says \"a sequence of actions\" to reach, and \"at turn t_1+H-1, y=9\", so I think at that turn, I am at 9, and the actions include up to that point or not.\n\nTo avoid confusion, let's look for the action at turn 17.\n\nIn the sequence for H=11, actions at t=7 to t=17.\n\nBut at turn 17, I am at y=9, so I can take S to stay.\n\nThen it works.\n\nIn my sequence, with actions from t=7 to t=16, I reach y=9 at turn 17, so at turn 17, y=9, and if I include action at turn 17, it can be S.\n\nSo for H=11, actions:\n\nTurn 7: D\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: S  (since at y=9, stay)\n\nThen at turn 17, y=9, and I take S, but y stays 9.\n\nAnd collision at turn 17 not possible since no freeway.\n\nSo it works.\n\nAnd H=11.\n\nIf I don't take action at turn 17, but the sequence must include until turn 17 for H=11.\n\nBut in the format, it should be fine.\n\nTo save one action, but I can't.\n\nSo I think this is minimal.\n\nPerhaps I can reach y=9 earlier by not going down, but I can't avoid the collision at t=8.\n\nUnless I can be on y=5 at turn 8, impossible.\n\nOr, on y=0 at turn 8, which I do.\n\nSo I think this is the way.\n\nSo the sequence is as above with S at the end.\n\nBut in the sequence, the last action is at turn 17 with S.\n\nBut since I am already at 9, it's fine.\n\nSome might omit the last action if not needed, but the problem asks for the sequence until the turn when I reach.\n\nHere I reach at turn 17, so action at turn 17 is not necessary, but for the sequence to have H turns, it includes it.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be included.\n\nPerhaps for turn 17, I can have no action, but the sequence specifies actions for each turn from t_1 to t_1+H-1.\n\nSo I think with S at turn 17.\n\nBut let's see if I can be at y=9 at turn 16.\n\nSuppose at turn 7, a_7=D, turn 8 y=0\n\na_8=U, turn 9 y=1\n\na_9=U, turn 10 y=2\n\na_10=U, turn 11 y=3\n\na_11=U, turn 12 y=4\n\na_12=U, turn 13 y=5\n\na_13=U, turn 14 y=6\n\na_14=U, turn 15 y=7\n\na_15=U, turn 16 y=8\n\nNot 9.\n\nTo have y=9 at turn 16, I need at turn 15 y=8, and a_15=U.\n\nBut from above, at turn 15 y=7, so I need to be at y=8 at turn 15.\n\nFrom turn 8 y=0, to turn 15 y=8, actions from t=8 to t=14, 7 actions, to increase y by 8, impossible, since each action changes by at most 1.\n\nSo min 8 actions needed, so at turn 16 y=8 at best, then turn 17 y=9.\n\nCannot be faster.\n\nSo H=11 is minimal.\n\nThus the sequence is:\n\nTurn 7: D\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: S\n\nFor the box.\n\nIn the sequence, turn 17 action S.\n\nBut at turn 17, I am already at y=9, and I take S, but it's fine.\n\nPerhaps the action at turn 17 is not needed, but for the sequence, it is included to have H=11.\n\nI think it's acceptable.\n\nTo avoid the S, but I have to include the turn.\n\nAnother way: since at turn 16, I am at y=8, I take U to go to y=9 at turn 17, but at turn 16, I am not at 9.\n\nBut for the position at turn 17, it is after action.\n\nI think I should go with the sequence.\n\nSo for the answer.\n</think>\nTo reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 1) at turn \\(t_1 = 7\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 11. The sequence of actions ensures that the player is not on a freeway \\(y\\) at any turn \\(T\\) where a collision would occur based on the car positions and movements.\n\n### Collision Analysis:\n- Freeways 1 to 4 have collisions only at turn \\(T = 8\\). Therefore, the player must not be on \\(y = 1, 2, 3,\\) or \\(4\\) at turn 8.\n- Freeways 5 and 6 have collisions at turns \\(T = 10\\) and \\(T = 11\\). Therefore, the player must not be on \\(y = 5\\) or \\(y = 6\\) at turns 10 and 11.\n- Freeways 7 and 8 have no collisions at any turn.\n\n### Strategy:\n- At turn 7, the player starts at \\(y = 1\\). To avoid collision at turn 8 on freeway 1, the only safe action is to move down to \\(y = 0\\) (action \\(D\\)), as staying or moving up would result in collision.\n- At turn 8, the player is at \\(y = 0\\) (safe, no freeway). Move up to \\(y = 1\\) (action \\(U\\)).\n- From turns 9 to 16, move up continuously (actions \\(U\\)) to reach \\(y = 9\\) by turn 17.\n- The player passes through freeways at safe times:\n  - \\(y = 1\\) at turn 9: safe (no collision at turn 9).\n  - \\(y = 2\\) at turn 10: safe (freeway 2 collision only at turn 8).\n  - \\(y = 3\\) at turn 11: safe (freeway 3 collision only at turn 8).\n  - \\(y = 4\\) at turn 12: safe (freeway 4 collision only at turn 8).\n  - \\(y = 5\\) at turn 13: safe (freeway 5 collisions at turns 10 and 11, not 13).\n  - \\(y = 6\\) at turn 14: safe (freeway 6 collisions at turns 10 and 11, not 14).\n  - \\(y = 7\\) at turn 15: safe (no collision on freeway 7).\n  - \\(y = 8\\) at turn 16: safe (no collision on freeway 8).\n- At turn 17, the player is at \\(y = 9\\) (safe, no freeway). An action \\(S\\) (stay) is taken to remain at \\(y = 9\\), completing the sequence.\n\n### Action Sequence:\nThe sequence of actions for turns \\(t = 7\\) to \\(t = 17\\) (11 turns) is:\n\n- Turn 7: Move down (\\(D\\)) to avoid collision at turn 8 on \\(y = 1\\).\n- Turn 8: Move up (\\(U\\)) to \\(y = 1\\).\n- Turns 9 to 16: Move up (\\(U\\)) each turn to increment \\(y\\) by 1 per turn.\n- Turn 17: Stay (\\(S\\)) at \\(y = 9\\).\n\nThis sequence achieves \\(y = 9\\) at turn 17 with \\(H = 11\\), the minimal number of turns, as any fewer turns would either cause a collision or fail to reach \\(y = 9\\) due to the initial required detour to \\(y = 0\\).\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 7: D \\\\\nTurn 8: U \\\\\nTurn 9: U \\\\\nTurn 10: U \\\\\nTurn 11: U \\\\\nTurn 12: U \\\\\nTurn 13: U \\\\\nTurn 14: U \\\\\nTurn 15: U \\\\\nTurn 16: U \\\\\nTurn 17: S\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t_1 = 8, and I'm at y=0.\n\nFirst, I should understand the car movements. Cars move left or right with a certain speed, and I need to make sure that when I'm on a freeway row y at turn T, the car on that row doesn't have its span covering x=0 at that exact turn.\n\nThe collision condition is that at turn T, if I'm on freeway y_T, and for any car on that freeway, 0 is in Span(T), then I crash.\n\nAlso, when I move from y_T to y_{T+1} at turn T, I'm only on y_T during turn T, not on y_{T+1} until the next turn. So when I change rows, I'm only considered on the starting row for that turn.\n\nNow, let's list the cars for each freeway row. Freeways are from y=1 to y=8.\n\nFor row 1: one car: head h=0, tail τ=-23, direction right, speed s=24. Since it's right-moving, the span at time t is [τ + s(t - t_1), h + s(t - t_1)]? Let's see the update rule.\n\nThe span at turn T for a car is given based on its state at t_1.\n\nFor a right-moving car: at t_1, span is [τ, h], so for this car, τ=-23, h=0, so at t_1, span is [-23, 0].\n\nThen at turn T, span is [τ + s(T - t_1), h + s(T - t_1)] = [-23 + 24(T - 8), 0 + 24(T - 8)] = [-23 + 24ΔT, 24ΔT] where ΔT = T - t_1.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, but all cars here are right-moving, I think. Direction is given as \"right\" for all.\n\nIn the table, all say \"right\", so all moving to the right.\n\nRow 2: one car: head 24, tail -11, direction right, speed 36. At t_1, span [τ, h] = [-11, 24].\n\nAt T, span [-11 + 36ΔT, 24 + 36ΔT]\n\nRow 3: same as row 2? It says (24, -11, right, 36), same as row 2.\n\nBut it's a different row, so separate car.\n\nSimilarly row 4: also (24, -11, right, 36), same parameters.\n\nNow row 5: multiple cars? It says \"(60, 49, right, 6), (24, 13, right, 6), (-12, -23, right, 6)\" so three cars on row 5.\n\nSimilarly row 6: same as row 5, three cars with same parameters.\n\nRow 7: one car: (-48, -59, right, 12). At t_1, span [τ, h] = [-59, -48]? Direction right, so span [τ, h] = [-59, -48].\n\nAt T, span [-59 + 12ΔT, -48 + 12ΔT]\n\nRow 8: (56, 45, right, 4). At t_1, span [45, 56]? τ=45, h=56? Tail and head, but for right-moving, it says span is [τ, h] at t_1, so [45,56].\n\nThen at T, [45 + 4ΔT, 56 + 4ΔT]\n\nNow, t_1 = 8, so ΔT = T - 8 for any turn T.\n\nI need to go from y=0 to y=9, starting at turn t_1=8, position (0,0).\n\ny=0 is not a freeway, I think, since freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 might be safe, no cars. The vertical axis is y=0 to 9, and freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are probably the start and end, no cars.\n\nThe player position is given as (0, y_{t_1}), and we need to reach (0,9), so y=0 and y=9 are the boundaries.\n\nAt y=0 and y=9, there are no cars, so no collision possible there. Only when on y=1 to 8, we need to worry about cars.\n\nNow, to minimize H, the number of turns, I need to get to y=9 as quickly as possible. Since I can move up, down, or stay, but moving down from y=0 might not be possible since y_{t+1} >=0, but y=0 is the bottom, so moving down might not be allowed or it stays at 0. The player update says y_{t+1} in [0,9], so if at y=0 and action D, y_{t+1} = max(0, y_t -1) =0, similarly at y=9, U would stay 9.\n\nBut since we start at y=0 and want to go to y=9, moving down doesn't help, so actions should be U or S, but S might be useful to wait.\n\nTo minimize turns, I should go up as much as possible, but I have to avoid the cars when on rows 1-8.\n\nH is the number of turns, from t=0 to H-1, so from turn t_1 to t_1 + H -1, after H actions, I should be at y=9.\n\nLet me denote the turn index relative to t_1. Set τ = 0 for turn t_1, so at τ=0, y=0.\n\nThen after k actions, at turn τ=k, position y_k.\n\nWe need y_H =9 for some H.\n\nActions at τ=0 to τ=H-1.\n\ny_{τ} after τ actions? Let's clarify.\n\nAt turn t_1, before any action, position is (0, y_{t_1}) = (0,0).\n\nThen I take action a_{t_1}, which determines y_{t_1 +1}, and so on.\n\nAfter action a_t, we have y_{t+1}.\n\nThe sequence: at turn t, I am at position y_t, then I choose action a_t, which determines y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nThen at the next turn, I am at y_{t+1}, and so on.\n\nCollision is checked at each turn when I am on a freeway row.\n\nFor turn T, if y_T is between 1 and 8, then for that row, if any car has 0 in its span at turn T, I crash.\n\nIf y_T not in 1-8, no crash.\n\nNow, to reach y=9, which is row 9, no cars.\n\nI start at y=0 at turn t_1=8.\n\nAfter H actions, I want to be at y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nThe turn when I arrive at y=9 is t_1 + H.\n\nAt that turn, since y=9, no cars, so no issue.\n\nThe actions are from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, so H actions.\n\nFor example, if I do nothing, stay at y=0, but I need to get to y=9.\n\nMinimal H would be if I go directly up, but I have to pass through rows 1-8, each taking at least one turn if I move up, but I might need to wait on some rows to avoid cars.\n\nSince I can move up or down or stay, I can change the timing.\n\nBut to minimize H, I should go up as fast as possible, only staying or moving down if necessary to avoid.\n\nBut moving down might not be efficient, so probably only stay or up.\n\nNow, let's find for each row, at which turns it is safe to be on that row, i.e., when no car has 0 in span.\n\nSince the cars move, the safety depends on time.\n\nFor each freeway row k, I need to find the times when it is safe, i.e., for all cars on that row, 0 not in span at that turn.\n\nFor row 1: one car, span at T: [-23 + 24(ΔT), 24(ΔT)] where ΔT = T - 8.\n\n0 in span if -23 + 24ΔT <= 0 <= 24ΔT\n\nSince 24ΔT >=0 for ΔT >=0, and -23 +24ΔT <= 24ΔT, so 0 in span if -23 +24ΔT <= 0 and 0 <= 24ΔT, so 24ΔT >=0 always true for ΔT >=0, and -23 +24ΔT <=0 implies 24ΔT <=23, so ΔT <= 23/24.\n\nAlso, since span is inclusive, I think, so when equal, it is included.\n\nSo 0 in span if -23 +24ΔT <= 0 <= 24ΔT\n\nLeft: -23 +24ΔT <=0 => 24ΔT <=23 => ΔT <= 23/24\n\nRight: 0 <= 24ΔT => ΔT >=0\n\nSo for ΔT =0, 0 is in span? At ΔT=0, T=t_1=8, span [-23,0], so 0 is included, since head is at 0.\n\nSimilarly, for ΔT=1, span [-23+24, 24] = [1,24], 0 not in, since 1>0.\n\nFor ΔT=0, 0 is in [ -23,0], yes.\n\nΔT <= 23/24, but since ΔT integer, ΔT=0 only.\n\nΔT integer? Turns are discrete, so T integer, ΔT integer.\n\nt_1=8, T integer, ΔT integer.\n\nAt ΔT=0, T=8, span [-23,0], 0 included, unsafe.\n\nΔT=1, T=9, span [1,24], 0 not in, safe.\n\nΔT=2, [25,48], safe, etc.\n\nSo for row 1, unsafe only at ΔT=0, i.e., turn t=8.\n\nSafe for all other turns.\n\nBut since we start at turn t=8, y=0, not on row 1 yet.\n\nWhen we move to row 1, it will be at some turn T>8.\n\nAt turn T, if y_T=1, and T>8, since unsafe only at T=8, for T>8, it is safe.\n\nSimilarly, row 2: car at t_1, span [-11,24] at T=8.\n\nAt T, span [-11 +36ΔT, 24 +36ΔT]\n\n0 in span if -11 +36ΔT <=0 <=24 +36ΔT\n\nLeft: -11 +36ΔT <=0 => 36ΔT <=11 => ΔT <= 11/36 <1, so ΔT=0\n\nRight: 0 <=24 +36ΔT always true for ΔT>=0\n\nAt ΔT=0, -11 <=0<=24, 0 in [-11,24], yes.\n\nΔT=1, [-11+36,24+36]=[25,60], 0 not in.\n\nSo unsafe only at T=8.\n\nSimilarly row 3: same as row 2, same parameters, unsafe only at T=8.\n\nRow 4: same, unsafe only at T=8.\n\nNow row 5: three cars.\n\nFirst car: (60,49,right,6) at t_1, span [τ,h] = [49,60] for right-moving? Tail τ=49, head h=60, so span [49,60] at t_1.\n\nAt T, [49 +6ΔT, 60 +6ΔT]\n\n0 in span if 49+6ΔT <=0 <=60+6ΔT\n\nBut 49+6ΔT >=49>0 for ΔT>=0, so left end >0, so 0 not in span, ever, for this car.\n\nSimilarly, second car: (24,13,right,6), span [13,24] at t_1.\n\nAt T, [13+6ΔT, 24+6ΔT]\n\n13+6ΔT >=13>0, so 0 not in span, always safe from this car.\n\nThird car: (-12,-23,right,6), span [τ,h] = [-23,-12] at t_1? Tail τ=-23, head h=-12, direction right, so span [τ,h] = [-23,-12]\n\nAt T, [-23 +6ΔT, -12 +6ΔT]\n\n0 in span if -23+6ΔT <=0 <= -12+6ΔT\n\nLeft: -23+6ΔT <=0 => 6ΔT <=23 => ΔT <= 23/6 ≈3.833, so ΔT<=3\n\nRight: 0 <= -12+6ΔT => 6ΔT >=12 => ΔT >=2\n\nSo 0 in span if 2 <= ΔT <=3\n\nFor ΔT=2, span [-23+12, -12+12] = [-11,0], so 0 included.\n\nΔT=3, [-23+18, -12+18] = [-5,6], 0 included.\n\nΔT=4, [-23+24, -12+24]=[1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo for this car, unsafe when ΔT=2 or 3.\n\nBut there are three cars on row 5. For the row to be unsafe, if any car has 0 in span.\n\nFirst two cars never have 0 in span, only the third one has at ΔT=2 and 3.\n\nSo row 5 is unsafe when ΔT=2 or 3, i.e., T=10 or 11 (since t_1=8, ΔT=2 T=10, ΔT=3 T=11)\n\nOther times safe.\n\nSimilarly, row 6: same as row 5, three cars with same parameters, so unsafe at T=10 and 11.\n\nNow row 7: one car (-48,-59,right,12)\n\nSpan at t_1: [τ,h] = [-59,-48]? Tail τ=-59, head h=-48, direction right, so span [τ,h] = [-59,-48]\n\nAt T, [-59 +12ΔT, -48 +12ΔT]\n\n0 in span if -59+12ΔT <=0 <= -48+12ΔT\n\nLeft: -59+12ΔT <=0 => 12ΔT <=59 => ΔT <= 59/12 ≈4.916, so ΔT <=4\n\nRight: 0 <= -48+12ΔT => 12ΔT >=48 => ΔT >=4\n\nSo 0 in span only when ΔT=4, because at ΔT=4, left: -59+48 = -11 <=0, right: -48+48=0 <=0? 0 <=0 is true, so 0 included.\n\nAt ΔT=4, span [-59+48, -48+48] = [-11,0], so 0 in.\n\nAt ΔT=3, [-59+36, -48+36] = [-23,-12], 0 not in.\n\nΔT=5, [-59+60, -48+60] = [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo unsafe only at ΔT=4, T=12.\n\nNow row 8: car (56,45,right,4)\n\nSpan at t_1: [τ,h] = [45,56]\n\nAt T, [45+4ΔT, 56+4ΔT]\n\n45+4ΔT >=45>0, so always >0, 0 never in span. Safe at all times.\n\nSummary of unsafe times for each row:\n\n- Row 1: unsafe only at T=8\n\n- Row 2: unsafe only at T=8\n\n- Row 3: unsafe only at T=8\n\n- Row 4: unsafe only at T=8\n\n- Row 5: unsafe at T=10,11\n\n- Row 6: unsafe at T=10,11\n\n- Row 7: unsafe at T=12\n\n- Row 8: always safe\n\nT is absolute turn, t_1=8.\n\nUnsafe:\n\nRow 1: T=8\n\nRow 2: T=8\n\nRow 3: T=8\n\nRow 4: T=8\n\nRow 5: T=10,11\n\nRow 6: T=10,11\n\nRow 7: T=12\n\nRow 8: never unsafe\n\nI start at turn T=8, y=0.\n\nI need to go from y=0 to y=9.\n\nEach move up increases y by 1, down decreases by 1, stay same.\n\nTo minimize turns, I want to move up as much as possible.\n\nBut I have to pass through each row from 1 to 8, and for each, when I am on that row at turn T, it must be safe, i.e., not unsafe at that T.\n\nSince I start at T=8, y=0.\n\nI take action at T=8 to go to y_{9}, which is at turn T=9.\n\nLet's define the turn when I am at position y.\n\nAt turn T, I am at y_T.\n\nFor T=8, y_8 = 0.\n\nAfter action a_8, y_9 = y_8 + Δy_8.\n\nSimilarly, after a_9, y_10, and so on.\n\nCollision at turn T if y_T between 1 and 8 and unsafe for that row at T.\n\nFor row k, unsafe only at specific T, as above.\n\nI need to be on row k only when it is safe.\n\nNow, I need to reach y=9 at some turn.\n\nSince y=9 has no cars, no issue.\n\nThe minimal number of moves: since from y=0 to y=9, I need to increase y by 9, so at least 9 moves up, but I can stay or move down, which might delay, but to minimize turns, I should not do unnecessary moves, so probably all actions U except when I need to wait.\n\nBut moving down might be needed to avoid, but in this case, since unsafe times are few, probably I can avoid by timing.\n\nNow, let's think about the path.\n\nI start at T=8, y=0.\n\nI need to go to y=1 at some point.\n\nBut row 1 is unsafe only at T=8, so if I go to y=1 at T=9 or later, it is safe.\n\nSimilarly for rows 2-4, unsafe only at T=8, so safe for T>8.\n\nRows 5 and 6 unsafe at T=10 and 11.\n\nRow 7 unsafe at T=12.\n\nRow 8 always safe.\n\nNow, to minimize H, I should go up as fast as possible.\n\nBut I have to avoid being on row 5 or 6 at T=10 or 11, and row 7 at T=12.\n\nAlso, since I start from y=0, I need to enter the rows.\n\nLet me list the turns I can be on each row safely.\n\nFor row 1: safe for T !=8, so T=9,10,11,12,... all except T=8.\n\nSimilarly row 2: safe for T>8, i.e., T=9,10,11,...\n\nRow 3: same, T=9,10,...\n\nRow 4: same, T=9,10,...\n\nRow 5: unsafe at T=10,11, so safe for T<=9 or T>=12.\n\nT<=9: T=9,8,7,... but T=8 is current, and we start at T=8, but row 5 not accessed yet, so for T>=9, safe when T<=9 or T>=12? T<=9 and T>=9 means T=9, or T>=12.\n\nUnsafe at T=10,11, so safe at T=9, and T=12,13,... and also T<8 but we start from T=8, so for T>=8, safe at T=8? T=8: is row 5 safe at T=8?\n\nAt T=8, for row 5, the third car has span [-23,-12] at T=8? Earlier: for row 5, at ΔT=0, T=8, span for third car [-23,-12], 0 not in, and other cars not cover 0, so row 5 is safe at T=8.\n\nSimilarly, at T=9, ΔT=1, for third car, [-23+6, -12+6] = [-17,-6], 0 not in, safe.\n\nT=10, ΔT=2, [-11,0], 0 in, unsafe.\n\nT=11, ΔT=3, [-5,6], 0 in, unsafe.\n\nT=12, ΔT=4, [1,12], safe.\n\nSo row 5 safe at T=8,9,12,13,... unsafe at T=10,11.\n\nSimilarly row 6 same, safe at T=8,9,12,13,... unsafe T=10,11.\n\nRow 7: unsafe only at T=12, so safe at T=8,9,10,11,13,14,... all except T=12.\n\nAt T=12, unsafe.\n\nRow 8: always safe.\n\nNow, I need to be on row k for some T, and move from row to row.\n\nSince I can only change y by at most 1 per turn, the sequence of rows must be consecutive, but I can stay or go down, but to go up, I need to increment y step by step.\n\nThe minimal H would be if I go directly from y=0 to y=9 in 9 moves, all U, so at turn T=8, y=0; after U, T=9, y=1; T=10, y=2; T=11, y=3; T=12, y=4; T=13, y=5; T=14, y=6; T=15, y=7; T=16, y=8; T=17, y=9.\n\nBut we need to check for each turn if safe when on freeway.\n\nAt T=9, y=1: row 1, which is safe since unsafe only at T=8.\n\nT=10, y=2: row 2, safe for T>8.\n\nT=11, y=3: row 3, safe.\n\nT=12, y=4: row 4, safe.\n\nT=13, y=5: row 5. Now row 5 at T=13: since T=13>12, ΔT=5, safe, as above.\n\nT=14, y=6: row 6 at T=14, ΔT=6, safe.\n\nT=15, y=7: row 7 at T=15. Row 7 unsafe only at T=12, so T=15 safe.\n\nT=16, y=8: row 8, always safe.\n\nT=17, y=9, no issue.\n\nSo in this path, all turns are safe, and H=9 actions: from T=8 to T=16, actions a8 to a16, y17=9.\n\nAfter 9 actions, y from 0 to 9.\n\nAt T=8, y=0, action a8, to y9.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t1 + H, y=9.\n\nHere t1=8, after H actions, at turn 8+H, y=9.\n\nIn this case, with all U, y9 at T=9? Let's see:\n\nT=8: y=0\n\na8=U, y9=1\n\na9=U, y10=2\n\na10=U, y11=3\n\na11=U, y12=4\n\na12=U, y13=5\n\na13=U, y14=6\n\na14=U, y15=7\n\na15=U, y16=8\n\na16=U, y17=9\n\nSo after 9 actions (a8 to a16), at T=17, y=9.\n\nH=9.\n\nNow, is this safe? At each turn when on freeway:\n\nT=9, y=1, row 1: safe (T=9>8)\n\nT=10, y=2, row 2: safe\n\nT=11, y=3, row 3: safe\n\nT=12, y=4, row 4: safe\n\nT=13, y=5, row 5: at T=13, which is safe as above (T=13 >=12)\n\nT=14, y=6, row 6: T=14 safe\n\nT=15, y=7, row 7: T=15 !=12, safe\n\nT=16, y=8, row 8: safe\n\nT=17, y=9, no freeway.\n\nSo all good, and H=9.\n\nBut is it minimal? Since I need to go from 0 to 9, minimum 9 moves up, so H=9 is minimal.\n\nBut in row 5 and 6, they are unsafe at T=10 and 11, but in this path, I am on row 5 at T=13, row 6 at T=14, which are safe.\n\nSimilarly, row 7 unsafe at T=12, but I am on row 7 at T=15, safe.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nBut the player starts at y=0, T=8, and we take actions from T=8 onwards.\n\nIn this sequence, we never are on a row at unsafe time.\n\nBut let me confirm row 5 at T=13.\n\nT=13, ΔT=5, row 5 cars: first car [49+6*5,60+6*5]=[49+30,60+30]=[79,90], not 0\n\nSecond [13+30,24+30]=[43,54], not 0\n\nThird [-23+30,-12+30]=[7,18], not 0, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nBut row 7 at T=12 is unsafe, but I am not on row 7 at T=12, I am on row 4 at T=12.\n\nIn the sequence, at T=12, y=4, row 4.\n\nRow 4 is safe at T=12.\n\nOnly row 7 is unsafe at T=12, but I am not there.\n\nSo fine.\n\nBut is there a way with H<9? No, because each U increases y by 1, from 0 to 9, need at least 9 U actions, and no S or D, so H=9 is minimal.\n\nIf I use S or D, it would take more turns, so H>9, not minimal.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 9, with all actions U.\n\nBut the answer should be a sequence.\n\nBut let me write the actions.\n\nTurn t1: a_{t1} = U\n\nTurn t1+1: a_{t1+1} = U\n\n...\n\nTurn t1+8: a_{t1+8} = U\n\nt1=8, actions from t1 to t1+8, that's 9 actions: t1, t1+1, ..., t1+8.\n\nAfter a_{t1+8}, y at turn t1+9.\n\nSet t1=8.\n\nActions: a8, a9, a10, a11, a12, a13, a14, a15, a16 all U.\n\nThen y17=9.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn T, action a_T.\n\nThe answer format: Turn t_1: a_{t_1}, Turn t_1+1: a_{t_1+1}, ..., up to Turn t_1 + H-1: a_{t_1 + H-1}\n\nHere H=9, so from Turn 8: a8 to Turn 16: a16, all U.\n\nBut let me make sure about the collision when moving.\n\nFor example, when I move from y to y+1, at turn T, I am at y, then move to y+1, so at turn T, I am on row y, and collision checked based on that.\n\nIn this case, no issue.\n\nPerhaps I can go faster, but no, 9 is minimal.\n\nBut in row 5 and 6, they are safe at T=8 and T=9, but in my path I am on them later, but since I start from bottom, I have to go through lower rows first.\n\nIf I could be on higher rows earlier, but I start at y=0, so I have to go through y=1,2,3,... sequentially, since I can only change by 1 per turn.\n\nUnless I stay or something, but that would take more turns.\n\nFor example, if I stay at y=0 for some turns, then go up, but that would increase H.\n\nSimilarly, moving down not helpful.\n\nSo H=9 with all U should be fine.\n\nBut let me check if at any point I might be unsafe.\n\nIn the sequence, at T=10, I am at y=2, row 2, which is safe, since unsafe only at T=8.\n\nSimilarly, T=11, y=3, row 3 safe.\n\nT=12, y=4, row 4 safe.\n\nT=13, y=5, row 5 safe, as T=13>11.\n\nBut row 5 is unsafe at T=10 and 11, but T=13 is fine.\n\nSimilarly, no conflict.\n\nPerhaps I can reach earlier, but from y=0 to y=9, minimum 9 steps.\n\nUnless I start moving earlier, but I start at T=8.\n\nAnother thing: at T=8, I am at y=0, which is safe, no freeway.\n\nThen I take action to go to y=1 at T=9.\n\nIf I had stayed at T=8, but y=0, not necessary.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nBut in the car state, for row 1, at T=8, it is unsafe, but I am not on it at T=8.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo the sequence should be all U for 9 actions.\n\nBut let me write it.\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nThen at turn 17, y=9.\n\nH=9.\n\nIn the answer, it should be from t_1 to t_1+H-1.\n\nt_1=8, H=9, so turns from 8 to 16.\n\nActions all U.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\"\n\nH=9.\n\nBut is there a way with H=9? Yes.\n\nPerhaps I can reach in fewer if I go down or something, but no, from 0 to 9, must increase by 9, so at least 9 up moves.\n\nUnless I can skip rows, but no, since each move changes y by at most 1.\n\nSo H=9 is minimal.\n\nBut let me see the unsafe times again.\n\nRow 7 is unsafe only at T=12.\n\nIn my path, I am on row 7 at T=15, which is safe.\n\nBut if I were on row 7 at T=12, it would be unsafe, but I am not.\n\nSuppose I want to be on row 7 at a different time.\n\nBut since I start from bottom, I go through rows in order.\n\nFor example, if I stay at some row to avoid bad time.\n\nBut in this case, for row 5 and 6, unsafe at T=10,11, but in direct path, I am on row 5 at T=13, not at 10 or 11.\n\nSimilarly, no need to wait.\n\nPerhaps I can go faster to higher rows, but I can't.\n\nAnother idea: since row 8 is always safe, and rows 1-4 safe after T=8, I can go up quickly.\n\nBut I still need to go through each row.\n\nFor example, if I go all U, I spend one turn on each row from 1 to 8, at turns T=9 to 16 for y=1 to 8, but y=1 at T=9, y=2 at T=10, ..., y=8 at T=16, y=9 at T=17.\n\nTurns on freeway: T=9 y=1, T=10 y=2, ..., T=16 y=8.\n\nAll safe as per above.\n\nIf I could be on multiple rows at once, but no.\n\nPerhaps I can move up slower to avoid, but that would increase H.\n\nFor example, if I stay at y=0 for one turn, then go up.\n\nAt T=8, y=0, action S, y9=0 (stay), then at T=9, y=0, then U to y=1 at T=10, and so on, then I reach later, say y=9 at T=18, H=10, worse.\n\nSimilarly, not better.\n\nSo all U with H=9 is best.\n\nBut in row 5 and 6, they are safe at T=8 and T=9, but since I start at y=0, I can't be on row 5 at T=8 or T=9, because I need to go through lower rows first.\n\nAt T=8, I am at y=0, so I can't be on row 5.\n\nSimilarly, to reach row 5, I need at least 5 moves up, so at T=13 at earliest if all U from start.\n\ny=0 at T=8, after 5 U, y=5 at T=13.\n\nSimilarly, cannot be earlier.\n\nSimilarly, row 6 at T=14 earliest.\n\nBoth safe at those times.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, the minimal sequence is all U actions for 9 turns.\n\nBut let me write the answer.\n\nThe current turn is t_1=8.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nAfter that, at turn 17, position (0,9).\n\nH=9.\n\nIn the boxed answer.\n\nBut the format should be:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: U\nTurn 16: U\n}\n\nBut let me confirm if at turn 10, when I am at y=2, row 2 is safe.\n\nAt turn 10, T=10, row 2: car span [-11 + 36*(10-8), 24 + 36*2] = [-11 + 72, 24+72] = [61,96], not including 0, safe.\n\nSimilarly, turn 11, y=3, row 3: same as row 2, span [61,96], safe.\n\nTurn 12, y=4, row 4: same, safe.\n\nTurn 13, y=5, row 5: as above, cars: [49+6*5,60+30]=[79,90], [13+30,24+30]=[43,54], [-23+30,-12+30]=[7,18], all not 0, safe.\n\nTurn 14, y=6, row 6: same as row 5, safe.\n\nTurn 15, y=7, row 7: at T=15, ΔT=7, span [-59 +12*7, -48 +84] = [-59+84, -48+84] = [25,36], not 0, safe.\n\nTurn 16, y=8, row 8: [45+4*8,56+32]? At T=16, ΔT=16-8=8, span [45+4*8, 56+32] = [45+32,56+32]=[77,88], not 0, safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nSo I think this is correct.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 8\\) is 9. The sequence of actions consists of moving up (U) for all 9 turns, as this directly increases the vertical position from 0 to 9 without any unnecessary delays. This sequence avoids all collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) because the player is not on any unsafe row at the unsafe times.\n\n### Unsafe Times for Freeways:\n- Rows 1–4: Unsafe only at turn \\(T = 8\\). Since the player starts at \\(y = 0\\) and moves to \\(y = 1\\) at \\(T = 9\\), these rows are safe for \\(T \\geq 9\\).\n- Row 5: Unsafe at \\(T = 10\\) and \\(T = 11\\). The player is on row 5 at \\(T = 13\\), which is safe.\n- Row 6: Unsafe at \\(T = 10\\) and \\(T = 11\\). The player is on row 6 at \\(T = 14\\), which is safe.\n- Row 7: Unsafe at \\(T = 12\\). The player is on row 7 at \\(T = 15\\), which is safe.\n- Row 8: Always safe.\n\n### Sequence of Actions:\n- At turn 8, the player is at \\((0, 0)\\). Action \\(U\\) moves to \\((0, 1)\\) at turn 9.\n- At turn 9, action \\(U\\) moves to \\((0, 2)\\) at turn 10.\n- At turn 10, action \\(U\\) moves to \\((0, 3)\\) at turn 11.\n- At turn 11, action \\(U\\) moves to \\((0, 4)\\) at turn 12.\n- At turn 12, action \\(U\\) moves to \\((0, 5)\\) at turn 13.\n- At turn 13, action \\(U\\) moves to \\((0, 6)\\) at turn 14.\n- At turn 14, action \\(U\\) moves to \\((0, 7)\\) at turn 15.\n- At turn 15, action \\(U\\) moves to \\((0, 8)\\) at turn 16.\n- At turn 16, action \\(U\\) moves to \\((0, 9)\\) at turn 17.\n\nThis sequence reaches \\((0, 9)\\) in 9 turns, and \\(H = 9\\) is minimal because at least 9 up moves are required to increase \\(y\\) from 0 to 9.\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn } 8: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 9: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 10: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 11: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 12: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 13: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 14: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 15: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 16: \\text{ U}\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 9, player starts at (0,1). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on the freeways we are on at each turn.\n\nImportant: Collision occurs at turn T only if the player is on a freeway y (from 1 to 8) and at that turn T, the car on that freeway has a span that includes 0 (the x-coordinate of the player).\n\nAlso note: when the player moves from y to y' at turn T, then at turn T the player is still on y (not on y') and then at turn T+1 the player is on y'. Therefore, at the moment of moving (turn T) we only care about the freeway we are currently on (y) and the cars on that freeway at turn T.\n\nWe are going to plan a sequence of actions (U, D, S) to go from y=1 to y=9.\n\nThe freeways are from 1 to 8. We start at y=1 at turn 9.\n\nWe must avoid the cars at the moment we are on a freeway. Specifically, at each turn T, if the player is on freeway k (which is between 1 and 8) then we require that no car on freeway k has a span that includes 0 at turn T.\n\nWe are given the car states at turn t1=9. We can compute the car positions at any future turn T by:\n\nFor a car that is left-moving (but note: all cars in the given state are right-moving? Let me check the directions: all are \"right\", so they are moving to the right? But the update rule for right-moving is: \n  Span(T) = [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]   ??? \n\nWait, the problem says:\n  Right-moving: [Span(t1)=[tau, h] -> [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut note: in the table, the cars are given as (head, tail, direction, speed). For example, freeway 1: (24, 1, right, 24). \n\nWhat does head and tail mean? For a right-moving car, the head is the front (rightmost) and the tail is the rear (leftmost). So the span at t1=9 is [tail, head] = [1,24] (since direction is right). \n\nBut the problem says for right-moving: the span at t1 is [tau, h] and then at T it becomes [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n\nSo for freeway 1 at t1=9: \n  tau = 1, h = 24, s=24, direction=right.\nAt turn T, the car will be at [1 + 24*(T-9), 24 + 24*(T-9)].\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 5: three cars: \n  car1: (-48, -59, right, 6) -> at t1=9: span = [-59, -48] (because for right-moving, the tail is the leftmost and head is the rightmost, so the given numbers: head=-48, tail=-59? But note: the problem says \"head h, tail tau\", and for right-moving, the head is greater than the tail? Actually, in the example for freeway1: head=24, tail=1 -> so head>tail. But for freeway5: head=-48 and tail=-59 -> so head=-48 is greater than tail=-59? Yes, because -48 > -59. So the span at t1=9 is [tail, head] = [-59, -48].\n\nBut wait: the problem says for right-moving: the span at t1 is [tau, h]. So that's [tail, head]. So the car covers from tail to head, which is from left to right.\n\nSo at time T, the car moves to [tau + s*(T-t1), head + s*(T-t1)].\n\nCollision condition: at turn T, if the player is on freeway k, then we require that 0 is not in the union of the spans of the cars on that freeway at turn T.\n\nNote: for a freeway, there might be multiple cars. So for freeway k, we have a list of cars. We must check that for every car on that freeway at turn T, 0 is not in [a_i, b_i] for any car i on that freeway.\n\nWe start at turn 9 at y=1. Our goal is to get to y=9. We can move up (U: y+1), down (D: y-1), or stay (S: y same). And we are bounded: y in [0,9]. So we cannot go below 0 or above 9.\n\nWe are to find the minimal H and the sequence of actions from turn 9 to turn 9+H-1 such that at the last turn (turn 9+H-1) we are at y=9.\n\nWe can use BFS (breadth-first search) over the state (turn, y) to find the minimal H. But note: the turn can be large because the cars move and we might have to wait? However, the minimal H should be at least 8 (if we move up 8 times) but we might have to wait sometimes to avoid cars.\n\nBut note: we start at y=1 and need to go to y=9: that's 8 steps up. However, we might have to go down and then up? But that would take more steps. So minimal H should be at least 8.\n\nBut we have to avoid collisions at every turn when we are on a freeway (y between 1 and 8). At y=0 and y=9, there are no cars? The problem says freeways are from y=1 to 8. So when we are at y=0 or y=9, we are safe.\n\nSo the goal is to be at y=9. Once we are at y=9, we are done and we don't need to be on any freeway. So we can stop.\n\nWe are going to simulate from turn 9 onwards.\n\nWe'll consider states: (t, y) where t is the current turn (starting at t0=9) and y in [0,9]. We want to get to (t,9) for some t>=9.\n\nWe'll use a queue for BFS: each state is (t, y) and we record the path to get there.\n\nBut note: the state space in time is infinite? However, the minimal H is at most ... we can bound the time? The cars move linearly, and we are only concerned with whether 0 is in the car's span at a particular turn. The cars are moving at constant speeds. The problem is that the car positions are linear in time. We can compute for a given freeway and a given turn whether the freeway is safe at that turn.\n\nWe are going to precompute for each freeway k (1 to 8) and for a time t (>=9) whether there is any car that covers 0.\n\nBut note: we are only concerned with the times when we are at that freeway. And we are going to simulate step by step.\n\nWe can write a helper function: safe(k, t) -> bool: returns True if at turn t, freeway k is safe (i.e., no car on k at time t has 0 in its span), else False.\n\nBut note: when we are at y=k (freeway k) at turn t, we require safe(k, t) to be true.\n\nAt y=0 or y=9, we don't care.\n\nWe are going to simulate from t=9, y=1.\n\nActions: U, D, S.\n\nWe must check:\n\n- At the current turn t, if we are at a freeway y (1..8), then we must have safe(y, t) is true. If not, we cannot be in that state.\n\n- Then we choose an action a in {U, D, S}. Then at the next state (t+1, y'):\n\n   If we do U: then at turn t we are still at y (current), and at turn t+1 we are at y+1.\n\n   Similarly for D: at turn t+1 we are at y-1.\n\n   For S: at turn t+1 we are at y.\n\nBut note: at the current turn t, we are at y. Then we take action a:\n\n   - If a = U: then we move to y+1 at turn t+1. But during turn t, we are at y. Then at turn t+1, we are at y+1.\n\n   - Similarly, if a = D: at turn t we are at y, at turn t+1 we are at y-1.\n\n   - If a = S: then at turn t we are at y, and at turn t+1 we are at y.\n\nTherefore, in state (t, y) we are at freeway y at turn t. Then we take an action, and then we end up at (t+1, y') and then we are at freeway y' at turn t+1.\n\nSo the state (t, y) must satisfy: if y is between 1 and 8, then safe(y, t) must be true.\n\nThen we generate next states (t+1, y') for y' = y (if S), y+1 (if U and y<9), y-1 (if D and y>0).\n\nWe start at (9,1). We require that at turn9, freeway1 is safe? Let's check.\n\nWe'll compute the safety for each freeway at turn9.\n\nWe are given the cars at turn9.\n\nFreeway1: one car: (head=24, tail=1, right, speed=24). So at turn9: span = [1, 24]. Since it's right-moving, at turn9: [tau + s*(0), head + s*(0)] = [1,24]. So 0 is not in [1,24] -> safe.\n\nFreeway2: (60,25,right,36): [25,60] -> 0 not in [25,60] -> safe.\n\nFreeway3: same as freeway2: [25,60] -> safe.\n\nFreeway4: same: [25,60] -> safe.\n\nFreeway5: three cars:\n   car1: (-48, -59, right, 6) -> at turn9: [-59, -48] -> 0 not in this interval? Actually, -59<=0<=-48? No, because -48 is greater than -59, but 0 is greater than -48? So 0 is not in [-59,-48] -> safe for this car.\n   car2: (30,19,right,6): [19,30] -> 0 not in [19,30] -> safe.\n   car3: (-6,-17,right,6): [-17,-6] -> 0 not in [-17,-6]? Actually, -17<=0<=-6? 0 is greater than -6? So no. So safe.\n\nFreeway6: same as freeway5 -> safe.\n\nFreeway7: (-36,-47,right,12): [-47,-36] -> 0 not in this -> safe.\n\nFreeway8: (60,49,right,4): [49,60] -> safe.\n\nSo at turn9, all freeways are safe? Then we can start.\n\nBut note: we are at y=1 at turn9, which is safe.\n\nWe need to go to y=9. The minimal number of moves is 8 (if we go up 8 times). But we have to check at each step if we are safe.\n\nWe can simulate:\n\nTurn9: at y=1 (safe)\n\nWe choose an action: U, D, or S? We want to go up. But we must ensure that at each future step we are safe.\n\nWe'll do BFS:\n\nLet's define:\n\n   visited[t][y]: whether we have been at state (t,y) already.\n\nWe start at (9,1). We set H=0 (but we haven't taken any action at turn9 yet). Actually, we are going to take an action at turn9 to move to the next state.\n\nWe are at (t,y) and we take an action a, then we are at (t+1, y') and we have taken one step.\n\nWe want to reach a state with y=9 at any turn.\n\nWe'll start by initializing:\n\n   queue: [ (9,1, []) ]   # (turn, y, path_so_far) and path_so_far is the list of actions taken so far (from turn9 to turn (current-1))\n\nBut note: at turn9, we are at (9,1) and we are going to take an action at turn9 to move to turn10 at a new y.\n\nSo we are going to generate:\n\n   From (9,1): \n        U: then we go to (10,2) and we have taken action U at turn9.\n        D: (10,0) -> but then we are at y=0, which is safe? Yes, because no freeway at y=0.\n        S: (10,1)\n\nBut we want minimal H. So we can do BFS by increasing time.\n\nWe'll check the next state: when we move to (t+1,y') we then check:\n\n   - If y' is 9, we are done. Then the path is the list of actions (which is the path_so_far plus the last action) and the total turns is the number of actions.\n\n   - Otherwise, we check that at (t+1, y'):\n\n        If y' is 0 or 9: safe.\n\n        Else (freeway 1..8): we must check that at turn t+1, freeway y' is safe.\n\nIf safe, then we add (t+1, y') to the queue.\n\nBut note: the state (t+1, y') might be reached by multiple paths? But we want minimal H (i.e., minimal number of actions). So we do BFS level by level (by time step). We start with step0: we are at (9,1). Then step1: after one action, we are at turn10, and y' in {0,1,2}. Then step2: turn11, etc.\n\nWe must avoid revisiting (t,y) if we have already been at (t,y) with the same or fewer steps? But if we get to (t,y) by two different paths, and one is shorter, we don't need the longer one. However, since we are doing BFS by time step (each step we advance time by one), then the first time we reach (t,y) is the minimal number of steps to get there? Not exactly: because we might get to (t,y) by different numbers of steps? Actually, the time t is increasing by one for each action. So if we are at (t,y) then the number of actions taken is (t - 9). So if we get to (t,y) by two different paths, they have the same number of actions (t-9). Therefore, we can mark visited states by (t,y). We don't need to consider the same (t,y) again.\n\nSo algorithm:\n\n   Let Q be a queue of (t, y, path) where path is the list of actions from turn9 to turn t-1.\n\n   Start: (9, 1, [])   -> at turn9, we haven't taken any action yet? But we are about to take an action at turn9.\n\n   We want to simulate until we get to y=9.\n\n   While Q not empty:\n\n        pop state (t, y, path)\n\n        For each action a in {U, D, S}:\n\n            if a == U and y < 9: then new_y = y+1\n            if a == D and y > 0: then new_y = y-1\n            if a == S: then new_y = y\n\n            Then we will be at (t+1, new_y)\n\n            But note: at the current state (t,y) we are at freeway y (if y in [1,8]) and we must have that freeway y is safe at turn t? Actually, we already ensured that when we entered (t,y) that it was safe? But wait: we are at (t,y) and we are about to leave it. We don't recheck (t,y) because we assume we entered safely.\n\n            However, we must check that the next state (t+1, new_y) is safe? Specifically:\n\n                At turn t+1, if new_y is in [1,8], then we must check safe(new_y, t+1).\n\n            But note: during the move, we are at freeway y at turn t (which we already checked when we entered state (t,y)? Actually, we did not check at the moment of leaving? \n\n            How we model:\n\n                We are at state (t,y) -> we have already checked at turn t that if y in [1,8] then it is safe? Actually, we did that when we entered (t,y) from the previous state. So we assume that (t,y) is safe.\n\n            Then we take an action a at turn t. Then:\n\n                At turn t: we are still at y (so we don't need to re-check because we assume we are safe at (t,y)).\n\n                Then at turn t+1, we are at new_y. And at turn t+1, we are on freeway new_y (if new_y in [1,8]) and we must check that at turn t+1, freeway new_y is safe.\n\n            So we must check for the next state: safe(new_y, t+1) if new_y in [1,8].\n\n            If new_y is 0 or 9, then it's safe.\n\n            Then we set next_state = (t+1, new_y, path + [a])\n\n            If new_y == 9: then we found a solution. The number of actions is len(path)+1, and the sequence of actions is path + [a]. We output and stop.\n\n            Else: we push (t+1, new_y, path + [a]) into the queue, if we haven't visited (t+1, new_y) before.\n\n   We mark visited states by (t,y).\n\nBut note: we must compute the safety for any freeway at any future turn.\n\nWe'll write a function safe(k, t) for freeway k at turn t (t>=9).\n\nHow to compute safe(k,t):\n\n   Given the initial state at turn9 for freeway k: a list of cars: each car is (h, tau, d, s) but note: in the table, the cars are given as (head, tail, direction, speed). \n\n   For a right-moving car (d='right'):\n\n        initial span at turn9: [tail, head]   -> but note: the problem says for right-moving: the span at turn9 is [tau, h] = [tail, head].\n\n        Then at turn t: [tail + s*(t-9), head + s*(t-9)]\n\n   But note: in the problem, the update for right-moving: \n        Span(T) = [tau + s*(T-t1), head + s*(T-t1)]\n\n   So we compute for each car on freeway k:\n\n        Let car = (h, tau, d, s)   [as given]\n\n        If d is right: \n            low = tau + s*(t-9)\n            high = h + s*(t-9)\n\n        Then 0 is in [low, high] if and only if low <= 0 <= high.\n\n   But note: the car spans are inclusive? The problem says \"span\", so I assume inclusive.\n\n   Then if for any car on freeway k at turn t: low <= 0 <= high, then unsafe -> return False.\n\n   If no car covers 0, then safe -> return True.\n\nBut note: the problem says for freeway k, there are multiple cars? Yes, for freeway5 and 6 there are three.\n\nSo we have to check all cars on that freeway.\n\nWe'll precompute the car configurations for each freeway at turn9 from the table.\n\nLet me list the cars for each freeway:\n\nFreeway1: [ (24, 1, 'right', 24) ]\nFreeway2: [ (60, 25, 'right', 36) ]\nFreeway3: [ (60, 25, 'right', 36) ]\nFreeway4: [ (60, 25, 'right', 36) ]\nFreeway5: [ (-48, -59, 'right', 6), (30, 19, 'right', 6), (-6, -17, 'right', 6) ]\nFreeway6: [ (-48, -59, 'right', 6), (30, 19, 'right', 6), (-6, -17, 'right', 6) ]\nFreeway7: [ (-36, -47, 'right', 12) ]\nFreeway8: [ (60, 49, 'right', 4) ]\n\nNow, we can write the safe(k,t) function.\n\nBut note: the directions are all 'right' in this problem? So we don't have left-moving? Then we only handle right.\n\nNow, let's code the BFS.\n\nWe are going to simulate until we find the goal.\n\nMinimal steps: at least 8. But we might have to wait sometimes? So we might take more than 8 steps.\n\nWe'll start BFS.\n\nWe'll use a set visited: (t,y)\n\nWe start:\n\n   t0 = 9, y0=1.\n\n   visited.add((9,1))\n\n   Queue: [ (9,1, []) ]\n\n   Then we expand:\n\n        t=9, y=1: \n            actions: U, D, S.\n\n            U: new_y = 2, next_t=10.\n                Check: at turn10, freeway2? -> y=2 is freeway2? Then we must check safe(2,10).\n\n                Compute for freeway2: one car: (60,25,right,36)\n                    low = 25 + 36*(10-9) = 25+36=61\n                    high = 60+36=96\n                    [61,96] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\n                Then next state: (10,2, ['U']). And we check: is 2==9? no. Then push.\n\n            D: new_y=0, next_t=10 -> safe (because y=0). Then state (10,0, ['D'])\n            S: new_y=1, next_t=10 -> check safe(1,10): freeway1: car (24,1,right,24)\n                    low = 1 + 24*(1)=25\n                    high=24+24=48 -> [25,48] -> 0 not in -> safe. Then state (10,1,['S'])\n\n        Now we have three states.\n\n        Then we continue.\n\n        We are looking for minimal steps. Since we are doing BFS by time, the first time we reach y=9 we have the minimal H.\n\n        So we continue until we hit y=9.\n\nBut note: we might get to y=9 at different times. We want the minimal H (number of actions) which is the same as the minimal time steps? Actually, H is the number of actions from turn9 to the last action. The last action is at turn (9+H-1) and then we are at turn (9+H) at y=9? \n\nWait: our state (t,y) is after having taken actions from turn9 to turn (t-1). So at state (t,y), we have taken (t-9) actions.\n\nThen if at state (t,y) we take an action a and then at turn t we take a and then at turn t+1 we are at new_y. And if new_y==9, then we have taken (t-9)+1 = t-8 actions? And we are done.\n\nSo we want the minimal t such that we can get to y=9 at turn t+1? But note: we are going to output the actions from turn9 to turn ... until the last action that gets us to y=9.\n\nActually, we are at turn9 at y=1. Then we take an action at turn9: then at turn10 we are at a new y. Then we take an action at turn10: then at turn11 we are at a new y, and so on.\n\nThe last action: suppose we take an action at turn T that moves us to y=9 at turn T+1. Then we stop. The sequence of actions is from turn9 to turn T (inclusive). The number of actions H = T - 8? Because turn9 is the first action, turn10 the second, ... turn T is the (T-8)th? Actually, from turn9 to turn T: there are T-8 actions? \n\nBut note: we start at turn9. Then we take an action at turn9, then at turn10, ... at turn T. So the number of actions is (T - 9 + 1) = T-8.\n\nBut in our state representation: \n\n   We are at (t,y) meaning we have taken actions at turns 9,10,...,t-1 (so t-9 actions) and we are at y at turn t.\n\n   Then we choose an action a for turn t, and then we go to (t+1, y') and we have taken one more action.\n\n   Then if at that next state y'=9, then the total actions = (t+1 - 9) = t-8.\n\n   And the actions are the path we have so far (which includes the actions for turns 9 to t-1) plus the last action a for turn t.\n\nSo the sequence of actions: for turn9: the first action in the list, turn10: the second, ... turn t: the last action.\n\nTherefore, the output will be:\n\n   Turn 9: a0\n   Turn 10: a1\n   ...\n   Turn t: a_{t-9}\n\nBut note: the state (t,y) has a path of length (t-9) (actions taken at turns 9 to t-1). Then we add one more action at turn t to get to y=9 at turn t+1.\n\nSo the total number of actions H = (t - 9) + 1 = t-8.\n\nWe want minimal H, so minimal t? But we are doing BFS by time (t increases by one at each step), so we will find the minimal t.\n\nNow, we code the BFS.\n\nWe'll simulate until we find a path.\n\nBut note: we might have to go to large t? However, since the cars move linearly, and we are bounded in y, we might have cycles? But we have visited states (t,y). Since t increases without bound, we might run forever? But we are bounded: we can only be at 10 y positions. And the car positions are periodic? Actually, no: they move linearly and the spans are shifting. However, the condition of a freeway being safe at a given time might become periodic? Not necessarily.\n\nBut note: we are only concerned with the time when we are at that freeway. And we are moving only 10 states. So we can bound the time? Actually, the minimal H is at least 8, and we might have to wait a few steps. But if we get stuck in a cycle, we can avoid by the visited state (t,y). However, since t increases, we won't cycle in the same (t,y). But we might visit the same y at a later time? Then we mark (t,y) as visited. So we avoid expanding the same (t,y) again.\n\nBut note: we might have to wait arbitrarily long? But we can bound the time? Actually, the cars move at constant speeds. The safety condition for a freeway k at time t: we can compute the intervals of time when freeway k is unsafe.\n\nFor example, for a car on freeway k: \n   It is unsafe at time t if: \n        low(t) <= 0 <= high(t)   =>   tau + s*(t-9) <= 0 <= h + s*(t-9)\n\n   Solve: \n        tau + s*(t-9) <= 0  => t <= ( -tau ) / s + 9\n        and 0 <= h + s*(t-9)  => t >= ( -h ) / s + 9\n\n   But note: if the car is moving to the right, then the span is moving to the right. So the unsafe time interval is:\n\n        t in [ max(9, ceil( ( -h ) / s + 9 ) ), floor( ( -tau ) / s + 9 ) ]\n\n   Actually, let me write:\n\n        low(t) = tau + s*(t-9) = s*t - 9*s + tau\n        high(t) = h + s*(t-9) = s*t - 9*s + h\n\n        Then we require: \n            s*t - 9*s + tau <= 0 <= s*t - 9*s + h\n\n        => \n            s*t <= 9*s - tau   => t <= (9*s - tau) / s = 9 - tau/s\n            and \n            s*t >= 9*s - h   => t >= 9 - h/s\n\n        So unsafe for t in [ ceil(9 - h/s), floor(9 - tau/s) ]   ??? \n\n   But note: tau and h can be negative? \n\n   Example: freeway1 at turn9: car (24,1,right,24)\n\n        Then: \n            t >= 9 - 24/24 = 9 - 1 = 8\n            t <= 9 - 1/24 = about 8.958 -> so t<=8.958 -> so only t=8? \n\n        But wait: we are at t>=9. So at t>=9, the car is at [1+24*(t-9), 24+24*(t-9)] -> which is always positive for t>=9? So safe.\n\n   Example: freeway5 car1: (-48, -59, right, 6)\n\n        Then: \n            t >= 9 - (-48)/6 = 9 + 48/6 = 9+8 = 17\n            t <= 9 - (-59)/6 = 9 + 59/6 ≈ 9+9.83 = 18.83\n\n        So unsafe for t in [17,18] (if we consider integer t). \n\n        Let me check at t=17:\n            low = -59 + 6*(17-9) = -59 + 48 = -11\n            high = -48 + 48 = 0\n            So [ -11, 0 ] -> 0 is included? yes. So unsafe at t=17.\n\n        t=18:\n            low = -59 + 6*9 = -59+54 = -5\n            high = -48+54=6 -> 0 in [ -5,6] -> unsafe.\n\n        t=19:\n            low = -59+6*10 = -59+60=1\n            high = -48+60=12 -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\n        So the interval is [17,18]? But our formula:\n\n            t >= 9 - (-48)/6 = 9+8=17\n            t <= 9 - (-59)/6 = 9 + 59/6 ≈ 18.83 -> so t in [17,18] for integer t.\n\n        So unsafe at t=17 and t=18.\n\n   Similarly, car2: (30,19,right,6): \n        t >= 9 - 30/6 = 9-5=4\n        t <= 9 - 19/6 ≈ 9-3.166 = 5.833\n        unsafe for t in [4,5] (but we start at t=9, so safe).\n\n   car3: (-6,-17,right,6):\n        t >= 9 - (-6)/6 = 9+1=10\n        t <= 9 - (-17)/6 ≈ 9 + 17/6 ≈ 9+2.833=11.833\n        unsafe for t=10,11.\n\n        Check t=10:\n            low = -17 + 6*(1)= -11\n            high = -6+6=0 -> 0 in -> unsafe.\n        t=11: \n            low = -17+12=-5\n            high = -6+12=6 -> unsafe.\n\n        t=12: safe.\n\n   So freeway5: \n        unsafe at t=10,11 (from car3) and t=17,18 (from car1). \n\n   Therefore, freeway5 is safe at t=9,12,13,14,15,16,19,... \n\n   Similarly, freeway6 has the same cars -> same unsafe times.\n\n   Freeway7: (-36,-47,right,12)\n        t >= 9 - (-36)/12 = 9+3=12\n        t <= 9 - (-47)/12 ≈ 9+47/12≈ 9+3.916=12.916\n        unsafe at t=12.\n\n        Check: \n            t=12: low=-47+12*(3)= -47+36=-11, high=-36+36=0 -> unsafe.\n\n        t=13: low=-47+12*4= -47+48=1, high=-36+48=12 -> safe.\n\n   Freeway8: (60,49,right,4)\n        t>=9-60/4=9-15=-6 -> always true for t>=9\n        t<=9-49/4=9-12.25=-3.25 -> never? \n        So safe for all t>=9? \n\n        Check: \n            at t=9: [49,60] -> safe.\n            at t=10: [49+4,60+4]=[53,64] -> safe.\n\n   Freeway1: safe for all t>=9? \n        t>=9-24/24=8 -> always true\n        t<=9-1/24≈8.958 -> so only t=8? -> so for t>=9, safe.\n\n   Freeway2: (60,25,right,36)\n        t>=9-60/36=9-5/3≈9-1.66=7.33 -> always for t>=9\n        t<=9-25/36≈9-0.69=8.305 -> so only t<=8.305 -> so for t>=9, safe? \n\n        Check: at t=9: [25,60] -> safe.\n        at t=10: [25+36,60+36]=[61,96] -> safe.\n\n   Similarly, freeway3 and 4 same as freeway2.\n\nSo the unsafe freeways at some times:\n\n   freeway5: unsafe at t=10,11,17,18\n   freeway6: same: unsafe at t=10,11,17,18\n   freeway7: unsafe at t=12\n   others: safe at all t>=9.\n\nNow, we run the BFS.\n\nWe start at (9,1) [turn9, y=1]\n\nAt turn9, we are at y=1: safe (as computed).\n\nWe generate:\n\n   U: (10,2) -> at turn10, y=2: freeway2 -> safe? yes (freeway2 safe at all t>=9). So state (10,2, ['U'])\n   D: (10,0) -> safe -> state (10,0,['D'])\n   S: (10,1) -> freeway1: safe -> state (10,1,['S'])\n\nThen we process (10,2,['U']):\n\n   Actions: U, D, S.\n\n        U: (11,3) -> freeway3: safe -> state (11,3,['U','U'])\n        D: (11,1) -> freeway1: safe -> state (11,1,['U','D'])\n        S: (11,2) -> freeway2: safe -> state (11,2,['U','S'])\n\nThen (10,0,['D']): \n        Actions: \n            U: (11,1) -> freeway1: safe -> state (11,1,['D','U'])   # but we already have (11,1) from above? We mark visited by (t,y) so we don't push if we have been at (t,y) before. So we push only if (11,1) is not visited.\n\n        D: cannot (y=0) -> D: y=-1 invalid.\n        S: (11,0) -> safe -> state (11,0,['D','S'])\n\nThen (10,1,['S']):\n        Actions:\n            U: (11,2) -> freeway2: safe -> state (11,2,['S','U'])   # but we already have (11,2) from above? \n            D: (11,0) -> state (11,0,['S','D'])   # but we have (11,0) from above?\n            S: (11,1) -> state (11,1,['S','S'])\n\nWe mark visited as we go.\n\nWe continue until we get to y=9.\n\nWe want to see if we can get to y=9 in 8 moves: \n\n   We start at y=1 at turn9.\n\n   We need to go from y=1 to y=9: 8 moves up.\n\n   So the sequence: 8 times U: \n        turn9: U -> turn10: y=2\n        turn10: U -> turn11: y=3\n        turn11: U -> turn12: y=4\n        turn12: U -> turn13: y=5\n        turn13: U -> turn14: y=6\n        turn14: U -> turn15: y=7\n        turn15: U -> turn16: y=8\n        turn16: U -> turn17: y=9 -> done.\n\n   But we must check at each step that the freeway we are on at the next turn is safe.\n\n   Specifically:\n\n        At turn10: we are at y=2 -> freeway2: safe (always) -> ok.\n        turn11: y=3 -> freeway3: safe -> ok.\n        turn12: y=4 -> freeway4: safe -> ok.\n        turn13: y=5 -> freeway5: at turn13: is freeway5 safe? \n                We computed: freeway5 unsafe at t=10,11,17,18 -> so at t=13, safe. -> ok.\n        turn14: y=6 -> freeway6: at turn14: unsafe at t=10,11,17,18 -> safe. -> ok.\n        turn15: y=7 -> freeway7: at turn15: unsafe at t=12 -> so at t=15, safe? \n                We computed: freeway7 unsafe only at t=12 -> safe. -> ok.\n        turn16: y=8 -> freeway8: safe -> ok.\n        turn17: y=9 -> goal.\n\n   So we can do the 8 U's.\n\n   Then the answer is:\n\n        Turn 9: U\n        Turn 10: U\n        Turn 11: U\n        Turn 12: U\n        Turn 13: U\n        Turn 14: U\n        Turn 15: U\n        Turn 16: U\n\n   And we are at y=9 at turn17.\n\n   So H=8.\n\nBut wait: at turn17 we are at y=9, so we stop. The last action is at turn16 (the 8th action).\n\nSo we output:\n\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: U\nTurn 16: U\n\nBut note: we must check that at the moment we are on freeway5 at turn13 and freeway6 at turn14: both are safe? Yes, as above.\n\nTherefore, we can do it in 8 steps.\n\nBut is there a faster way? 8 is minimal because we need to go up 8 steps.\n\nSo we output the above.\n\nBut let me double-check the freeway5 at turn13: \n   freeway5: three cars:\n\n   car1: (-48, -59, right,6): \n        at turn13: t-9=4\n        low = -59 + 6*4 = -59+24 = -35\n        high = -48+24 = -24 -> [ -35, -24] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\n   car2: (30,19,right,6):\n        low = 19+24=43, high=30+24=54 -> safe.\n\n   car3: (-6,-17,right,6):\n        low = -17+24=7, high=-6+24=18 -> safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway6 at turn14: same as freeway5 at turn14? \n\n   freeway6: same cars.\n\n   car1: low = -59 + 6*(14-9)= -59+30=-29, high=-48+30=-18 -> safe.\n   car2: 19+30=49, 30+30=60 -> safe.\n   car3: -17+30=13, -6+30=24 -> safe.\n\nAnd freeway7 at turn15: \n   car: (-36,-47,right,12)\n        t-9=6\n        low=-47+12*6=-47+72=25, high=-36+72=36 -> safe.\n\nSo yes.\n\nTherefore, the minimal sequence is 8 consecutive U's.\n\nBut wait: what if we try to go faster? We cannot because we need 8 moves.\n\nSo we output:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: U\nTurn 16: U\n}\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" and so on. So we start at turn9 and end at turn16.\n\nTotal turns: 8.\n\nBut let me check if we can get stuck at some point? We don't need to because we found a safe path.\n\nSo we are done.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 1) at turn 9. The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y = 1 to 8. \n\nThe minimal path requires 8 turns, as the player must move upward 8 times to go from y = 1 to y = 9. The sequence of actions is:\n\n- At turn 9, move up (U) to y = 2.\n- At turn 10, move up (U) to y = 3.\n- At turn 11, move up (U) to y = 4.\n- At turn 12, move up (U) to y = 5.\n- At turn 13, move up (U) to y = 6.\n- At turn 14, move up (U) to y = 7.\n- At turn 15, move up (U) to y = 8.\n- At turn 16, move up (U) to y = 9.\n\nThe freeways are checked for safety at each turn:\n- Turn 10 (y=2): Freeway 2 is safe (car span [61, 96] does not contain 0).\n- Turn 11 (y=3): Freeway 3 is safe (car span [61, 96] does not contain 0).\n- Turn 12 (y=4): Freeway 4 is safe (car span [61, 96] does not contain 0).\n- Turn 13 (y=5): Freeway 5 is safe (car spans [-35, -24], [43, 54], [7, 18] do not contain 0).\n- Turn 14 (y=6): Freeway 6 is safe (car spans [-29, -18], [49, 60], [13, 24] do not contain 0).\n- Turn 15 (y=7): Freeway 7 is safe (car span [25, 36] does not contain 0).\n- Turn 16 (y=8): Freeway 8 is safe (car span [53, 64] does not contain 0).\n\nThis path reaches y = 9 at turn 17 after 8 actions, which is minimal.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 9: U \\\\\nTurn 10: U \\\\\nTurn 11: U \\\\\nTurn 12: U \\\\\nTurn 13: U \\\\\nTurn 14: U \\\\\nTurn 15: U \\\\\nTurn 16: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to get the player from (0,2) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t_1 = 10. I have to output a sequence of actions starting from turn 10.\n\nThe player moves up, down, or stays with U, D, S actions. y changes by +1, -1, or 0 respectively, and y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars move on their freeways. For each car, I'm given its position at turn t_1=10, and I need to compute where it will be at future turns to avoid collisions.\n\nCollision happens at turn T if the player is on a freeway y_T and for that freeway, 0 is within the span of some car at that turn. Since the player is at x=0, and cars have spans that move, collision is when 0 is between the head and tail (inclusive, I assume) for a car on the same y as the player at that turn.\n\nImportant point: when the player moves to a new y, at the turn they move, they are not on the new y yet; they only occupy the new y at the next turn. Let me read that again.\n\n\"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nSo, at turn T, the player is on y_T. If they choose to move to a different y, say by U or D, then during turn T, they are still on y_T, and only at turn T+1 are they on y_{T+1}. So for collision at turn T, we only care about the car on y_T at that turn.\n\nAnd collision depends on whether 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway at that exact turn.\n\nNow, for each freeway, I have the car states at t=10.\n\nLet me list them out:\n\nFreeway 1: one car, head=48, tail=25, direction=right, speed=24. Since it's right-moving, head should be greater than tail? It says \"right-moving: Span(t_1) = [τ, h]\" so for right, [τ, h] with τ < h I assume.\n\nIn the car update: for left-moving, span is [h, τ] and it moves left, so h decreases. For right-moving, span is [τ, h] and it moves right, so τ and h increase.\n\nIn the state given, for freeway 1: (48,25,right,24). But if it's right-moving, and span is [τ, h], so τ should be less than h? 48 and 25, 25<48, so τ=25, h=48? But it says \"head h, tail τ\", and for right, it says \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h]\" so [tail, head], with tail < head.\n\nSimilarly for left, [head, tail] with head > tail decreasing.\n\nIn freeway 1: (48,25,right,24) — head=48, tail=25? But for right-moving, span should be [tail, head] = [25,48], I think. Let's see the notation.\n\nIt says: \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nThen in update: for right-moving, \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h]\" so yes, for right, [τ, h] with τ < h, and it moves to [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT].\n\nSimilarly for left, [h, τ] moves to [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT].\n\nIn freeway 1: head=48, tail=25, direction=right, so at t=10, span is [τ, h] = [25,48], since right.\n\nSpeed 24, so at time T, position is [25 + 24*(T-10), 48 + 24*(T-10)]\n\nSimilarly, for other freeways.\n\nNow, freeway 2: (-48, -83, right, 36)\n\nRight-moving, so span [τ, h] = [-83, -48]? τ = -83, h = -48, since τ < h.\n\nThen at T, [ -83 + 36*(T-10), -48 + 36*(T-10) ]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as freeway 2? (-48,-83,right,36) — head=-48, tail=-83, but for right, tail should be less than head, so tail=-83, head=-48, span [-83,-48].\n\nSimilarly freeway 4: same.\n\nNow freeway 5: multiple cars: (-42,-53,right,6), (36,25,right,6), (0,-11,right,6)\n\nEach has its own span.\n\nFirst car: head=-42, tail=-53, direction right, so tail=-53, head=-42? tail should be less, -53 < -42, so span [τ,h] = [-53,-42]\n\nAt T, [ -53 + 6*(T-10), -42 + 6*(T-10) ]\n\nSecond car: (36,25,right,6) — head=36, tail=25, span [25,36]\n\nAt T, [25 + 6*(T-10), 36 + 6*(T-10)]\n\nThird car: (0,-11,right,6) — head=0, tail=-11, span [-11,0]\n\nAt T, [ -11 + 6*(T-10), 0 + 6*(T-10) ] = [ -11 +6ΔT, 6ΔT ] where ΔT = T-10\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6: same as freeway 5? (-42,-53,right,6), (36,25,right,6), (0,-11,right,6) — identical to freeway 5.\n\nFreeway 7: (-24,-35,right,12) — head=-24, tail=-35, right, so span [-35,-24]\n\nAt T, [ -35 +12ΔT, -24 +12ΔT ]\n\nFreeway 8: (-48,-59,right,4) — head=-48, tail=-59, right, span [-59,-48]\n\nAt T, [ -59 +4ΔT, -48 +4ΔT ]\n\nNow, the player starts at y=2 at t=10.\n\nI need to go to y=9. Since y can only change by at most 1 per turn, the minimum number of turns to move from y=2 to y=9 is 7 turns, if I go up every time: U,U,U,U,U,U,U to go from 2 to 9, that's 7 actions, ending at turn 16.\n\nBut I might have to avoid collisions, so I might need to wait or go down sometimes, which could take more turns. But since I want minimal H, I should try to go up as fast as possible, only deviating if necessary.\n\nH is the number of turns, so from t=10 to t=10+H-1, so with H actions, I can be at y=9 at turn t=10 + H - 1.\n\nFor example, if I start at t=10, y=2.\n\nAfter first action at t=10, I move to new y at t=11, and so on.\n\nAt turn T, after action, I am at y_T.\n\nSequence: at turn 10, I perform action a_10, which determines y_11.\n\nLet's clarify the timing.\n\nThe state is given at turn t_1=10: player at (0,2).\n\nThen I choose action a_{10}, which affects y_{11}.\n\nSimilarly, a_{11} affects y_{12}, and so on, up to some turn when y=9.\n\nThe position at turn T is y_T.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t_1 + H - 1 = 10 + H - 1, y should be 9.\n\nFor example, if H=1, I need to be at y=9 at turn 10, but I'm at y=2, so impossible. Min H is 7, as above.\n\nWith H actions, I start from t=10, perform a_{10} to go to y_{11}, ..., a_{10+H-2} to go to y_{10+H-1}, and at y_{10+H-1} =9.\n\nThe sequence of actions is for t from t_1 to t_1 + H - 1, so indices t=10 to 10+H-1.\n\nBut y_{t} is determined after action at t-1, I think.\n\nDefine:\n\nAt the beginning of turn t, player is at y_t.\n\nThen I choose action a_t, which determines y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nThen at turn t, I am on freeway y_t, and I check for collision with cars on y_t at time t.\n\nAfter action, I move to y_{t+1} for the next turn.\n\nIn the collision rule, it says: \"collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T\"\n\nSo at turn T, y_T is the freeway I'm on, and we check Span at time T for cars on that freeway.\n\nFor example, at turn T, I am at y_T, and for freeway y_T, if 0 is in some car's span at time T, collision.\n\nWhen I move, at turn T, if I choose to go to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T, during turn T I am still on y_T, so only cars on y_T matter for collision at T.\n\nNow, I need to find a path from y=2 to y=9, minimizing the number of moves H.\n\nSince the grid is small, only y from 0 to 9, and time, I can simulate the possible moves and check for collisions at each step.\n\nBut time is continuous, but since car positions change linearly, I can compute for each freeway and each time when 0 is covered by a car.\n\nFirst, let's list for each freeway when 0 is in the span.\n\nFor a given freeway k, at time T, if 0 is in some car's span on that freeway, then it is blocked at T.\n\nOtherwise, it is safe to be on that freeway at T.\n\nBut since I move step by step, I need to ensure that for each turn T, when I am at y_T, it is not blocked.\n\ny_T is the freeway at turn T.\n\nNow, T is integer, since turns are discrete.\n\nCars move continuously, but since their positions are linear, and time is integer, I can compute for each integer T the span positions.\n\nLet ΔT = T - 10, for T >= 10.\n\nNow for each freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: y=1, I assume freeway k corresponds to y=k? Yes, freeway 1 to 8 are for y=1 to 8.\n\nPlayer is on y=0 or y=9, no cars, so always safe, I think. y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, so no cars there. The freeways are y=1 to 8, so when player is on y=0 or y=9, no collision possible. y=0 is the bottom, y=9 top, I think.\n\nThe vertical axis y=0,1,2,...,9, and freeways are on y=1 to 8 for cars.\n\nSo when player is on y=0 or y=9, there are no cars, so safe.\n\nIn this case, start at y=2, which is freeway 2, so we need to check.\n\nGoal y=9, safe.\n\nNow, for freeway 1 (y=1): one car, span at T: [25 + 24ΔT, 48 + 24ΔT]\n\n0 in span if 25 + 24ΔT <= 0 <= 48 + 24ΔT\n\nSince 24ΔT +25 <= 0 <= 24ΔT +48\n\nFirst inequality: 24ΔT +25 <=0 => 24ΔT <= -25 => ΔT <= -25/24 ≈ -1.041, since ΔT >=0, this is never true? ΔT = T-10 >=0 for T>=10.\n\nT starts from 10, ΔT >=0.\n\n24ΔT +25 >=25 >0, so 0 <= 24ΔT +25 is false? Let's see:\n\n0 <= 48 + 24ΔT is always true since ΔT>=0, 48+24ΔT >=48>0.\n\nBut the left inequality: 25 + 24ΔT <= 0? 25 + 24ΔT >=25 >0, so 25 + 24ΔT <=0 is false for all ΔT >=0.\n\nTherefore, 0 is never <= 25 + 24ΔT? Let's write properly.\n\nThe span is [L, U] where L = 25 + 24ΔT, U = 48 + 24ΔT\n\n0 in [L,U] if L <= 0 <= U.\n\nL = 25 + 24ΔT >= 25 > 0 for all ΔT >=0, so L > 0, thus 0 < L <= U, so 0 is less than L, not in [L,U].\n\nTherefore, for freeway 1, at all times T>=10, 0 is not in the span. So freeway 1 is always safe? But let's confirm.\n\nL = 25 + 24ΔT >=25 >0, U >=48>0, so [L,U] is always positive, 0 not in it. Yes, so no collision possible on y=1 for any T>=10.\n\nGood.\n\nFreeway 2 (y=2): car (-48,-83,right,36) — head=-48, tail=-83, right, so span [τ,h] = [-83, -48] at t=10.\n\nAt T: L = -83 + 36ΔT, U = -48 + 36ΔT\n\n0 in span if L <= 0 <= U, so -83 + 36ΔT <= 0 and 0 <= -48 + 36ΔT\n\nFirst: -83 + 36ΔT <= 0 => 36ΔT <= 83 => ΔT <= 83/36 ≈ 2.305, so ΔT <= 2 since integer.\n\nSecond: 0 <= -48 + 36ΔT => 48 <= 36ΔT => ΔT >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈1.333, so ΔT >= 2 since integer? 36ΔT >=48, so ΔT >= 48/36 = 4/3, since ΔT integer, ΔT >= 2? 4/3≈1.333, so ΔT >= 2? Let's see:\n\nΔT >= ceil(4/3) = ceil(1.333) = 2? No.\n\nΔT must satisfy both.\n\nFirst inequality: -83 +36ΔT <=0 => 36ΔT <=83 => ΔT <= floor(83/36) = 83/36=2.305, floor=2? Since ΔT integer, ΔT <=2.\n\n36*2=72 <=83, 36*3=108>83, so ΔT <=2.\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= -48 +36ΔT => 36ΔT >=48 => ΔT >= ceil(48/36) = ceil(4/3) = ceil(1.333) =2? 48/36=4/3≈1.333, so ΔT >=2 since integer.\n\n36ΔT >=48, ΔT >= 48/36 = 4/3, since ΔT integer, ΔT >= 2.\n\nAnd ΔT <=2 from above.\n\nSo both: ΔT >=2 and ΔT <=2, so only at ΔT=2.\n\nAt ΔT=2, L = -83 + 36*2 = -83 + 72 = -11\n\nU = -48 + 72 = 24\n\nSo [ -11, 24 ], 0 is between -11 and 24, so yes, 0 in span.\n\nAt other times, not.\n\nFor example, ΔT=1: L = -83+36= -47, U= -48+36= -12? U= -48 +36= -12, L= -83+36= -47, so span [-47,-12], both negative, 0 not in.\n\nΔT=3: L= -83+108=25, U= -48+108=60, [25,60], 0 not in.\n\nSo only at T=10 + ΔT=10+2=12, freeway 2 is blocked.\n\nT=12, y=2 is unsafe.\n\nAt other times, safe.\n\nBut at T=10, ΔT=0, L= -83, U= -48, [-83,-48], 0 not in, so at t=10, y=2 is safe.\n\nNow freeway 3: same as freeway 2? Freeway 3 has (-48,-83,right,36), same as freeway 2.\n\nIn the table: freeway 3: (-48,-83,right,36) — identical to freeway 2.\n\nSo for y=3, same thing: only unsafe at T=12.\n\nFreeway 4: also same, (-48,-83,right,36), so y=4 unsafe only at T=12.\n\nNow freeway 5: y=5, multiple cars.\n\nFirst car: (-42,-53,right,6) — head=-42, tail=-53, right, span [τ,h] = [-53,-42] at t=10.\n\nAt T: L = -53 +6ΔT, U= -42 +6ΔT\n\n0 in span if -53 +6ΔT <=0 <= -42 +6ΔT\n\nFirst: -53 +6ΔT <=0 => 6ΔT <=53 => ΔT <= 53/6 ≈8.833, so ΔT <=8\n\nSecond: 0 <= -42 +6ΔT => 42 <=6ΔT => ΔT >= 42/6 =7\n\nSo ΔT >=7 and ΔT <=8? ΔT integer.\n\nΔT >= ceil(42/6)= ceil(7)=7\n\nΔT <= floor(53/6)= floor(8.833)=8\n\nSo for ΔT=7 and 8.\n\nAt ΔT=7: L= -53 +42= -11, U= -42 +42=0, so [-11,0], 0 is included, so unsafe.\n\nAt ΔT=8: L= -53+48= -5, U= -42+48=6, [-5,6], 0 included.\n\nNow second car on y=5: (36,25,right,6) — head=36, tail=25, span [25,36] at t=10.\n\nAt T: L=25 +6ΔT, U=36 +6ΔT\n\nBoth L and U positive for ΔT>=0, min L=25>0, so 0 never <= L, so 0 not in span. Always safe for this car.\n\nThird car: (0,-11,right,6) — head=0, tail=-11, span [-11,0] at t=10.\n\nAt T: L= -11 +6ΔT, U=0 +6ΔT =6ΔT\n\n0 in span if L <=0 <= U\n\nL <=0: -11 +6ΔT <=0 => 6ΔT <=11 => ΔT <=11/6≈1.833, so ΔT<=1\n\nU >=0: 6ΔT >=0, always true for ΔT>=0.\n\nSo 0 <= U always, and L <=0 only if ΔT <=1.\n\nAt ΔT=0: L=-11, U=0, [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nΔT=1: L=-11+6=-5, U=0+6=6, [-5,6], 0 included.\n\nΔT=2: L=-11+12=1, U=12, [1,12], 0 not <=1? 0 <1, not in [1,12].\n\nSo for third car, unsafe at ΔT=0 and ΔT=1, i.e., T=10 and T=11.\n\nNow for freeway 5, it is unsafe if any car has 0 in span.\n\nSo at T=10 (ΔT=0): first car span [-53,-42], 0 not in; second car [25,36], 0 not; third car [-11,0], 0 in. So unsafe.\n\nT=11 (ΔT=1): first car L=-53+6=-47, U=-42+6=-36, [-47,-36], 0 not; second car [31,42], 0 not; third car [-5,6], 0 in. Unsafe.\n\nT=12 (ΔT=2): first car L=-53+12=-41, U=-42+12=-30? U=-42+12=-30, L=-53+12=-41, [-41,-30], 0 not; second car [37,48], 0 not; third car L=-11+12=1, U=12, [1,12], 0 not in. So safe.\n\nT=13 (ΔT=3): similarly, first car [-53+18,-42+18]=[-35,-24], 0 not; second [43,54], no; third [7,18], no. Safe.\n\n...\n\nT=17 (ΔT=7): first car, as before, unsafe at ΔT=7: L=-53+42=-11, U=-42+42=0, [-11,0], 0 in. Unsafe.\n\nSimilarly T=18 (ΔT=8): L=-53+48=-5, U=-42+48=6, [-5,6], 0 in. Unsafe.\n\nT=19 (ΔT=9): L=-53+54=1, U=-42+54=12, [1,12], 0 not. Safe.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBut for now, freeway 5 unsafe at T=10,11,17,18.\n\nT=10,11 from third car, T=17,18 from first car.\n\nNow freeway 6: same as freeway 5? In the table, freeway 6 has the same cars: (-42,-53,right,6), (36,25,right,6), (0,-11,right,6) — identical to freeway 5.\n\nSo y=6 unsafe at same times: T=10,11,17,18.\n\nNow freeway 7 (y=7): (-24,-35,right,12) — head=-24, tail=-35, right, span [τ,h] = [-35,-24] at t=10.\n\nAt T: L = -35 +12ΔT, U = -24 +12ΔT\n\n0 in span if -35 +12ΔT <=0 <= -24 +12ΔT\n\nFirst: -35 +12ΔT <=0 => 12ΔT <=35 => ΔT <= 35/12 ≈2.916, so ΔT <=2\n\nSecond: 0 <= -24 +12ΔT => 24 <=12ΔT => ΔT >= 24/12 =2\n\nSo ΔT >=2 and ΔT <=2, only ΔT=2.\n\nAt ΔT=2: L= -35+24= -11, U= -24+24=0, [-11,0], 0 included, unsafe.\n\nOther times safe.\n\nT=12.\n\nFreeway 8 (y=8): (-48,-59,right,4) — head=-48, tail=-59, right, span [-59,-48] at t=10.\n\nAt T: L = -59 +4ΔT, U = -48 +4ΔT\n\n0 in span if -59 +4ΔT <=0 <= -48 +4ΔT\n\nFirst: -59 +4ΔT <=0 => 4ΔT <=59 => ΔT <=59/4=14.75, so ΔT <=14\n\nSecond: 0 <= -48 +4ΔT => 48 <=4ΔT => ΔT >=12\n\nSo ΔT >=12 and ΔT <=14.\n\nAt ΔT=12: L= -59 +48= -11, U= -48+48=0, [-11,0], unsafe\n\nΔT=13: L= -59+52= -7, U= -48+52=4, [-7,4], 0 in\n\nΔT=14: L= -59+56= -3, U= -48+56=8, [-3,8], 0 in\n\nΔT=15: L= -59+60=1, U= -48+60=12, [1,12], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSo y=8 unsafe at T=22,23,24? T=10+12=22, T=10+13=23, T=10+14=24.\n\nΔT=12,13,14 → T=22,23,24.\n\nNow, summarize unsafe times for each freeway:\n\n- y=1: always safe (as we saw)\n\n- y=2: unsafe only at T=12\n\n- y=3: same as y=2, unsafe at T=12\n\n- y=4: same, unsafe at T=12\n\n- y=5: unsafe at T=10,11,17,18\n\n- y=6: same as y=5, unsafe at T=10,11,17,18\n\n- y=7: unsafe at T=12\n\n- y=8: unsafe at T=22,23,24\n\nPlayer starts at t=10, y=2.\n\nAt t=10, y=2 is safe, as we saw earlier.\n\nNow, I need to go to y=9, min steps.\n\nSince y=1 is always safe, I could go down to y=1 or up, but y=1 is safe, but going down might take more time.\n\nMin steps up: from y=2 to y=9, need +7, so 7 up moves, but I might need to wait or avoid.\n\nNow, let's see the unsafe times.\n\nFirst, at t=10, I am on y=2, which is safe.\n\nI need to choose action: U, D, or S.\n\nIf I go up, to y=3 at t=11.\n\nBut at t=11, if I am on y=3, is it safe?\n\ny=3 unsafe only at t=12, so at t=11, y=3 is safe? From above, y=3 same as y=2, unsafe only at t=12, so at t=11, safe.\n\nSimilarly, if I go down to y=1, y=1 always safe.\n\nOr stay, y=2 at t=11, which is safe since unsafe only at t=12.\n\nBut staying might not help, since I need to go up.\n\nSimilarly, going down to y=1 might be safe but adds extra steps.\n\nNow, let's plan a path.\n\nI want to reach y=9 asap.\n\nStart at t=10, y=2.\n\nOption 1: Go up every turn.\n\nThen:\n\nt=10: action U, go to y=3 at t=11? After action at t=10, y_{11} = y_10 + Δy = 2 +1 =3.\n\nPosition at turn t: y_t.\n\nAt turn t=10, y_10=2.\n\nAfter action a_10, y_11 = y_10 + Δy_10.\n\nThen at turn t=11, y_11, and so on.\n\nFor collision at turn T, it depends on y_T.\n\nIn this case:\n\n- At t=10: y=2, safe (as above)\n\nAction a_10: suppose U, then y_11 = 2+1=3\n\n- At t=11: y=3, now check if safe. y=3 unsafe only at t=12, so at t=11, safe. So no collision.\n\nThen action a_11: U, y_12=3+1=4\n\n- At t=12: y=4, now y=4 unsafe at t=12? From above, y=4 same as y=2 and y=3, unsafe at t=12.\n\nSo at t=12, y=4, and it is unsafe, collision.\n\nProblem.\n\nSo if I go up at t=10 and t=11, at t=12 I am on y=4 which is unsafe.\n\nCannot go directly up because at t=12, y=2,3,4 are all unsafe.\n\ny=2,3,4 unsafe at t=12.\n\ny=5 at t=12: from above, y=5 at t=12 (ΔT=2) is safe, as we saw for freeway 5 at T=12, safe.\n\nSimilarly y=6 safe at t=12.\n\ny=7 unsafe at t=12.\n\ny=8 safe at t=12.\n\nSo at t=12, unsafe freeways: y=2,3,4,7.\n\nSafe: y=1,5,6,8.\n\nAnd y=0,9 always safe.\n\nNow back to path.\n\nAt t=10, y=2 safe.\n\nI need to avoid being on y=2,3,4 at t=12.\n\nSimilarly, y=7 at t=12 unsafe.\n\nOptions:\n\n- I could go down to y=1 at some point.\n\n- Or go up but skip t=12 on unsafe y.\n\nSince min steps, I should go up when possible.\n\nAt t=10, if I go up to y=3 at t=11.\n\nThen at t=11, y=3, which is safe (unsafe only t=12).\n\nNow at t=11, I need to choose action.\n\nIf I go up again, y_12=4, but at t=12 y=4 unsafe.\n\nIf I go down, to y=2 at t=12, but y=2 unsafe at t=12.\n\nIf I stay, y_12=3, unsafe at t=12.\n\nSo all bad.\n\nTherefore, from y=3 at t=11, I cannot go to y=2,3,4 at t=12 because all unsafe.\n\nBut I could go to another y.\n\nFor example, from y=3 at t=11, if I go down to y=2? But action down: a_11=D, then y_12 = y_11 -1 = 3-1=2.\n\nThen at t=12, y=2, unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, if a_11=S, y_12=3, unsafe.\n\nIf a_11=U, y_12=4, unsafe.\n\nSo from t=11 on y=3, no matter what I do, at t=12 I will be on y=2,3, or4, all unsafe.\n\nTherefore, I must not be on y=3 at t=11 if I plan to be on a safe y at t=12.\n\nPerhaps I should not go up at t=10.\n\nAt t=10, instead of going up, I could go down to y=1.\n\nAction a_10=D, then y_11 = 2-1=1.\n\nAt t=11, y=1, which is always safe.\n\nNow, at t=11, y=1, safe.\n\nI need to go up.\n\nAction a_11: U, then y_12=1+1=2.\n\nBut at t=12, y=2 is unsafe.\n\nProblem.\n\nIf a_11=S, stay on y=1, but then I waste time.\n\na_11=S, y_12=1, still on y=1, safe, but not progress.\n\nThen later I need to go up, but t=12 is critical.\n\nAt t=11, on y=1, I could do something else, but only U,D,S.\n\nIf I go up, to y=2 at t=12, unsafe.\n\nIf I stay, no progress.\n\nIf I go down, but y=0, safe, but even worse.\n\nSo from y=1 at t=11, going up leads to y=2 at t=12 unsafe.\n\nStaying or down wastes time.\n\nBut I need to avoid t=12 on unsafe y.\n\nSince y=1 is safe at t=12, I could be on y=1 at t=12.\n\nThen from there go up.\n\nBut to be on y=1 at t=12, I need to be on y=1 at t=12.\n\nAt t=11, if I am on y=1, and I stay, then y_12=1.\n\nThen at t=12, y=1, safe.\n\nThen from there I can go up.\n\nBut let's see the time.\n\nStart t=10, y=2.\n\na_10: D to y=1 at t=11.\n\nt=11: y=1, safe. a_11: S, then y_12=1.\n\nt=12: y=1, safe. a_12: U to y=2 at t=13.\n\nNow at t=13, y=2, which is safe? y=2 unsafe only at t=12, so at t=13, safe.\n\nThen I can go up.\n\nBut this took extra steps: from t=10 to t=13, I am still at y=2? Let's see positions:\n\nt=10: y=2\n\na10: D, y11=1\n\nt11: y=1, a11: S, y12=1\n\nt12: y=1, a12: U, y13=2\n\nt13: y=2\n\nSo at t=13, back to y=2, which is safe, but I wasted 3 turns to be at same y, not good.\n\nFrom t=12 on y=1, I could go up directly, but to y=2 at t=13.\n\nBut I need to go to y=9.\n\nMoreover, there are other unsafe times, like for y=5 and y=6 at t=17,18.\n\nBut first, let's handle t=12.\n\nI could go to y=5 or y=6 at t=12, which are safe.\n\nFor example, from start, how to reach y=5 by t=12.\n\ny=5 at t=12 is safe.\n\nBut from y=2 at t=10, to y=5 at t=12, that means in two actions, I need to increase y by 3, but I can only change by 1 per turn, so impossible to reach y=5 by t=12.\n\ny at turn t.\n\nAt t=10, y=2.\n\nAfter two actions: a10 and a11, determine y11 and y12.\n\ny11 = y10 + Δy10, which could be 1,2,3? No, Δy is -1,0,1, so y11 = 1,2, or 3.\n\nThen y12 = y11 + Δy11, so from y11, y12 could be y11-1, y11, y11+1.\n\nSo min y12: if y11=1, y12=0,1,2; max y12: if y11=3, y12=2,3,4.\n\nSo at t=12, y can be from 0 to 4, cannot be 5 or above.\n\nSimilarly, cannot be below 0, but y=0 possible.\n\nSo at t=12, possible y: 0,1,2,3,4.\n\nBut y=2,3,4 unsafe at t=12, y=0 and y=1 safe.\n\ny=1 is freeway, but we said always safe, y=0 no freeway, safe.\n\nSo only safe options at t=12 are y=0 or y=1.\n\nTherefore, I must be on y=0 or y=1 at turn t=12 to avoid collision.\n\nAt t=10, y=2.\n\nI need to reach y=0 or y=1 by t=12.\n\nThat takes at most two steps down, but let's see.\n\nOption: go down at t=10 to y=1 at t=11.\n\nThen at t=11, on y=1, safe.\n\nThen to be on y=1 or y=0 at t=12, I can stay or go down.\n\nIf go down to y=0 at t=12.\n\nOr stay on y=1.\n\nThen from there, I can go up.\n\nBut going to y=0 might not help, since I need to go up later.\n\nSo probably stay on y=1 at t=12.\n\nThen after t=12, I can go up.\n\nNow, what about later unsafe times.\n\nFirst, let's list all critical times.\n\nWe have t=12 for y=2,3,4,7.\n\nt=17,18 for y=5,6.\n\nt=22,23,24 for y=8.\n\nSince I start from low y, t=22 is far, I might reach y=9 before that.\n\nMin steps to y=9 is 7, from y=2 to y=9, 7 up moves, at t=17 I could be at y=9.\n\nt=10: y=2\n\nAfter 1st U: t=11 y=3\n\n2nd U: t=12 y=4 — but unsafe, cannot\n\nBut we avoid t=12.\n\nWith waiting, it takes more turns.\n\nAt t=17, y=5 and y=6 are unsafe, so I need to avoid being on y=5 or y=6 at t=17 and t=18.\n\nSimilarly, t=18.\n\nNow, to minimize H, I should go up as fast as possible except when forced to avoid.\n\nFirst, handle t=12.\n\nSo I must be on y=0 or y=1 at t=12.\n\nEasiest: from t=10 y=2, go down to y=1 at t=11.\n\nThen at t=11, on y=1, stay or go down.\n\nIf I stay, at t=12 y=1, safe.\n\nThen after that, go up.\n\nNow, from t=12 y=1, I can start going up.\n\nBut at t=17 and 18, y=5 and 6 unsafe.\n\nNow, let's see when I can reach y=9.\n\nIf I go up continuously from t=12.\n\nt=12: y=1\n\na12: U, y13=2\n\nt13: y=2, safe? y=2 unsafe only t=12, so t=13 safe. a13: U, y14=3\n\nt14: y=3, safe (unsafe only t=12). a14: U, y15=4\n\nt15: y=4, safe. a15: U, y16=5\n\nNow t=16: y=5, is it safe? y=5 unsafe at t=17,18? At t=16, what is ΔT?\n\nT=16, ΔT=16-10=6.\n\nFor y=5, unsafe at T=10,11,17,18.\n\nT=16, ΔT=6, not in unsafe times, so safe.\n\nThen a15: U? At t=15 y=4, a15=U, y16=5.\n\nt=16 y=5, safe.\n\nNow a16: U, y17=6\n\nt=17: y=6, now y=6 unsafe at t=17? y=6 same as y=5, unsafe at t=17,18.\n\nt=17, ΔT=7, T=10+7=17, yes unsafe.\n\nSo at t=17, if on y=6, collision.\n\nProblem.\n\nSimilarly, if I go to y=5 at t=16, then at t=17 to y=6, unsafe.\n\nI could stay or something.\n\nAt t=16 y=5, safe.\n\nInstead of going up, I could stay: a16=S, then y17=5.\n\nBut at t=17, y=5, which is unsafe.\n\ny=5 unsafe at t=17, so if on y=5 at t=17, collision.\n\nIf I go down to y=4, but at t=17 y=4, is it safe? y=4 unsafe only at t=12, so at t=17 safe.\n\nBut y=4 is lower.\n\nBut at t=17, I need to be on safe y.\n\nOptions at t=17: y=5 and y=6 unsafe, y=1,2,3,4,7,8 should be safe except we know y=7 unsafe only t=12, y=8 unsafe at t=22, etc.\n\ny=7 at t=17: ΔT=7, for y=7, unsafe only at t=12, so safe.\n\ny=8 safe at t=17.\n\nSo at t=17, unsafe only y=5 and y=6.\n\nSimilarly t=18 same.\n\nSo to avoid, at t=17 and t=18, I should not be on y=5 or y=6.\n\nNow back to the path.\n\nFrom above, at t=16, I am at y=5 (if I went up continuously).\n\nt=16 y=5, safe.\n\nI need to not be on y=5 or y=6 at t=17 and t=18.\n\nSo at t=17, I can be on y=4, y=7, etc.\n\nBut y=7 is higher, better.\n\nFrom y=5 at t=16, if I go up to y=6, but at t=17 y=6 unsafe.\n\nIf I stay, y=5 unsafe at t=17.\n\nIf I go down to y=4, safe, but lower.\n\nI could go directly to y=7.\n\nBut from y=5, I can only go to y=4,5,6 with one action.\n\nCannot jump to y=7.\n\nSo at t=16 y=5, actions:\n\n- U: to y=6 at t=17, but t=17 y=6 unsafe\n\n- S: to y=5 at t=17, unsafe\n\n- D: to y=4 at t=17, safe\n\nSo only option is to go down to y=4 to avoid collision.\n\nThen at t=17, y=4, safe.\n\nBut now I am at y=4, lower than before.\n\nThen I need to go up again, wasting time.\n\nAt t=17, y=4, I can go up to y=5 at t=18.\n\nBut at t=18, y=5, which is unsafe (since y=5 unsafe at t=18).\n\nt=18, ΔT=8, for y=5, unsafe at t=18, yes.\n\nSo if I go to y=5 at t=18, collision.\n\nIf from y=4 at t=17, I stay: a17=S, y18=4, safe, but not progress.\n\nOr go down to y=3, safe but worse.\n\nSo to avoid, at t=18, I need to not be on y=5 or y=6.\n\nSo from y=4 at t=17, if I go up to y=5 at t=18, unsafe.\n\nIf I stay, y=4 safe.\n\nBut then I can go up later.\n\nBut this delays.\n\nPerhaps from earlier, I can time it so that I am not on y=5 or y=6 at t=17 and t=18.\n\nFor example, if I reach y=5 after t=18.\n\nBut let's see the timing.\n\nSince I have to spend time at y=1 around t=12, I might delay the ascent.\n\nAnother idea: go down to y=1 at t=11 and t=12, then start going up, but slower to avoid being at y=5 or y=6 at t=17,18.\n\nt=17 is 7 turns after t=10.\n\nt=10 to t=17 is 7 turns, but I start from y=2 at t=10.\n\nIf I go up directly, I could be at y=9 at t=17, but t=17 is when y=6 is unsafe, but if I am at y=9, safe.\n\nBut I couldn't go directly because of t=12.\n\nWith waiting, let's compute a path.\n\nStart t=10 y=2.\n\nTo avoid t=12, go down to y=1.\n\na10: D, so y11=1\n\nt11: y=1, safe. Now to be at y=1 at t=12, a11: S, y12=1\n\nt12: y=1, safe.\n\nNow from here, I want to go up to y=9.\n\nBut I need to avoid y=5 and y=6 at t=17 and t=18.\n\nt=17 is 5 turns after t=12? t=12 to t=17 is 5 turns.\n\nFrom y=1 at t=12, to y=9, need 8 steps up, but min 8 actions.\n\nBut I can be at y=9 at t=20, for example.\n\nBut t=17,18 are before that.\n\nNow, let's see where I am at t=17.\n\nFrom t=12 y=1:\n\nSuppose I go up each turn.\n\na12: U, y13=2\n\nt13: y=2, a13: U, y14=3\n\nt14: y=3, a14: U, y15=4\n\nt15: y=4, a15: U, y16=5\n\nt16: y=5, a16: U, y17=6\n\nAt t=17, y=6, which is unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, if I continue, a17: U, y18=7, but at t=17 y=6 unsafe.\n\nProblem at t=17.\n\nTo avoid, at t=16, I am at y=5 (if I went up).\n\nAt t=16 y=5, I need to not go to y=6 at t=17.\n\nSo I must go down or stay, but staying or down at t=16 means at t=17 I am on y=5 or y=4.\n\nIf on y=5 at t=17, unsafe.\n\nIf on y=4, safe.\n\nSo go down to y=4 at t=17.\n\nThen at t=17 y=4, safe.\n\nThen at t=17, I can go up to y=5 at t=18.\n\nBut at t=18, y=5, which is unsafe (y=5 unsafe at t=18).\n\nSo collision.\n\nIf at t=17 y=4, I stay: a17=S, y18=4, safe.\n\nThen at t=18, y=4, I can go up to y=5 at t=19.\n\nBut at t=19, y=5 is safe, since unsafe only at t=10,11,17,18, so t=19 safe.\n\nThen I can continue up.\n\nBut let's see the sequence.\n\nFrom start:\n\nt=10: y=2, a10: D, y11=1\n\nt=11: y=1, a11: S, y12=1  (stay to be safe at t=12)\n\nt=12: y=1, a12: U, y13=2\n\nt=13: y=2, a13: U, y14=3\n\nt=14: y=3, a14: U, y15=4\n\nt=15: y=4, a15: U, y16=5\n\nt=16: y=5, now here, instead of going up, go down to avoid t=17 on y=5 or y=6.\n\na16: D, then y17=4\n\nt=17: y=4, safe (since y=4 only unsafe at t=12)\n\nNow at t=17, y=4, I need to go up, but if I go up to y=5 at t=18, unsafe.\n\nSo I should stay: a17: S, y18=4\n\nt=18: y=4, safe. Now a18: U, y19=5\n\nt=19: y=5, safe (t=19 not unsafe time)\n\nThen a19: U, y20=6\n\nt=20: y=6, now y=6 unsafe at t=17,18, but t=20 safe, so ok.\n\na20: U, y21=7\n\nt=21: y=7, safe? y=7 unsafe only at t=12, so safe.\n\na21: U, y22=8\n\nt=22: y=8, now y=8 unsafe at t=22,23,24.\n\nt=22, ΔT=12, unsafe.\n\nSo at t=22, y=8, collision.\n\nProblem again.\n\nI forgot about y=8 unsafe at t=22.\n\nt=22 is 12 turns after t=10.\n\nIn this path, at t=22 I am at y=8, unsafe.\n\nSo I need to avoid that.\n\nNow, at t=22, y=8 unsafe, so I should not be on y=8 at t=22,23,24.\n\nIn the above, I am at y=8 at t=22, which is bad.\n\nI could be at y=9 before t=22.\n\nBut in this path, I am at y=8 at t=22.\n\nFrom t=19 y=5, I went up to y=6 at t=20, y=7 at t=21, y=8 at t=22.\n\nBut at t=22 y=8 unsafe.\n\nTo reach y=9 earlier, but I have delays.\n\nSince y=7 is safe at t=22, I could stay on y=7 longer or something.\n\nBut let's list the position over time in this path:\n\nt=10: y=2\n\nt=11: y=1 (after down)\n\nt=12: y=1\n\nt=13: y=2\n\nt=14: y=3\n\nt=15: y=4\n\nt=16: y=5\n\nt=17: y=4 (after down)\n\nt=18: y=4 (stay)\n\nt=19: y=5\n\nt=20: y=6\n\nt=21: y=7\n\nt=22: y=8  -- unsafe\n\nAt t=21 y=7, if I don't go up, but stay, then at t=22 y=7, safe.\n\nThen later go up.\n\nBut I need to go to y=8 and y=9.\n\ny=8 unsafe at t=22,23,24.\n\nSo at t=22,23,24, I should not be on y=8.\n\nSo I can be on y=8 before or after.\n\nFor example, at t=21 y=7, I can go to y=8 at t=22, but t=22 unsafe.\n\nOr stay on y=7.\n\nThen at t=22 y=7, safe.\n\nThen at t=22, I can go to y=8 at t=23, but t=23 y=8 unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, if I go at t=23 to y=8, t=23 y=8 unsafe.\n\nThe unsafe times are t=22,23,24 for y=8.\n\nSo I can be on y=8 at t=21 or before, or at t=25 or after.\n\nt=21: ΔT=11, T=21, for y=8, unsafe at t=22,23,24, so at t=21, ΔT=11, L= -59 +4*11= -59+44= -15, U= -48+44= -4, [-15,-4], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly t=25: ΔT=15, L= -59+60=1, U= -48+60=12, [1,12], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSo at t=21, y=8 safe, t=25 y=8 safe.\n\nIn the path, at t=21 I am at y=7.\n\nI can go to y=8 at t=22, but t=22 unsafe.\n\nTo be on y=8 at t=21, I need to reach y=8 earlier.\n\nBut in current path, I reach y=8 at t=22.\n\nBecause of the delays.\n\nLet's see how to reach higher faster.\n\nMinimal time to y=9 from start is 7 turns, at t=17.\n\nBut with obstacles, I have to spend extra turns.\n\nIn the sequence above, I have extra actions: I went down at t=10, stayed at t=11, down at t=16, stayed at t=17 and t=18? In the sequence I have:\n\nActions: a10=D, a11=S, a12=U, a13=U, a14=U, a15=U, a16=D, a17=S, a18=U, a19=U, a20=U, a21=U, then y22=8\n\nBut a21=U from y=7 to y=8 at t=22.\n\nH is the number of actions, from t=10 to t=10+H-1.\n\nIn this case, up to a21, which is t=21, action at t=21, y at t=22.\n\ny at turn t=22 is 8.\n\nThen to reach y=9, I need another action, a22=U, y23=9.\n\nBut at t=22, y=8, which is unsafe, collision.\n\nSo not good.\n\nAt t=21 y=7, I can stay: a21=S, y22=7, safe at t=22.\n\nThen at t=22, y=7, I can go up to y=8 at t=23, but t=23 y=8 unsafe.\n\nOr stay on y=7.\n\nThen at t=23, y=7, safe, go to y=8 at t=24, but t=24 y=8 unsafe.\n\nGo at t=24 to y=8, t=24 y=8 unsafe.\n\nSo to avoid, I need to be on y=8 before t=22 or after t=24.\n\nFor example, at t=21, if I am at y=8, safe.\n\nBut how to reach y=8 by t=21.\n\nFrom start, t=10 y=2, to t=21 y=8, that's 11 turns, net increase 6, so possible with 6 up and some down or stay.\n\nBut I have to handle the other obstacles.\n\nSince y=1 is always safe, I could stay on y=1 for a few turns to delay the ascent, so that when I go up, I pass y=5 and y=6 after t=18, and y=8 after t=24.\n\nFor example, stay on y=1 from t=11 to some turn.\n\nAt t=10 y=2, a10: D to y=1.\n\nThen at t=11 y=1, I can stay for K turns, then start going up.\n\nAfter staying K turns on y=1, at some turn T, I start going up.\n\nThen I need to reach y=9 as fast as possible, but avoiding unsafe times.\n\nUnsafe times: y=5 and y=6 at t=17,18; y=8 at t=22,23,24.\n\nSo I should pass y=5 and y=6 before t=17 or after t=18.\n\nSimilarly for y=8 before t=22 or after t=24.\n\nSince I start from low, after t=18 is easier.\n\nAlso, for y=8, after t=24.\n\nBut t=24 is late.\n\nIf I can pass y=5 and y=6 before t=17, but t=17 is early, and I am delayed at y=1, so I might not reach in time.\n\nFor example, if I stay on y=1 from t=11 to t=12 (as before), then at t=12 y=1, start going up.\n\nTo reach y=5 before t=17, y=5 at t=16 or earlier.\n\nFrom t=12 y=1 to y=5, need 4 up moves, so at t=16 y=5.\n\nThen at t=16 y=5, safe (since t=16 not unsafe for y=5).\n\nThen at t=17, I need to not be on y=5 or y=6.\n\nFrom y=5 at t=16, if I go up to y=6 at t=17, unsafe.\n\nSo I must go down to y=4 or stay, but stay unsafe.\n\nGo down to y=4 at t=17.\n\nThen at t=17 y=4, safe.\n\nBut then I am at y=4, and I need to go up to y=5 at t=18, but t=18 y=5 unsafe.\n\nSo I have to wait until t=19 to go to y=5.\n\nThen from there, to y=9.\n\nBut for y=8, I will reach around t=23 or so, which might be unsafe.\n\nLet's calculate.\n\nt=12: y=1\n\na12: U, y13=2\n\na13: U, y14=3\n\na14: U, y15=4\n\na15: U, y16=5  -- t=16 y=5 safe\n\na16: D, y17=4  -- to avoid t=17 on y=5/6\n\nt=17: y=4, safe\n\na17: S, y18=4  -- stay to avoid t=18 on y=5\n\nt=18: y=4, safe\n\na18: U, y19=5  -- t=19 y=5 safe (not 17,18)\n\na19: U, y20=6\n\nt=20: y=6, safe (unsafe only 17,18)\n\na20: U, y21=7\n\nt=21: y=7, safe\n\na21: U, y22=8  -- t=22 y=8, unsafe\n\nSame problem.\n\nAt t=21 y=7, if I stay, a21: S, y22=7, safe at t=22.\n\nThen a22: U, y23=8, but t=23 y=8 unsafe.\n\na22: U to y=8 at t=23.\n\nt=23 y=8 unsafe.\n\nIf I stay on y=7 longer.\n\nAt t=22 y=7, a22: S, y23=7, safe.\n\nThen a23: U, y24=8, t=24 y=8 unsafe.\n\na23: U to y=8 at t=24, unsafe.\n\nSo I need to be on y=8 at t=21 or t=25.\n\nt=21 is early, t=25 late.\n\nTo be on y=8 at t=21, from start.\n\nt=10 y=2.\n\nTo y=8 at t=21, net increase 6 in 11 turns, so possible with 6 up and 5 other actions (down or stay).\n\nBut I have to spend time at y=1 for t=12.\n\nLet's see if I can reach y=8 by t=21.\n\nt=10 y=2.\n\nI need to be at y=1 at t=11 and t=12 for safety.\n\nSo a10: D, y11=1\n\na11: S, y12=1\n\nNow at t=12 y=1.\n\nFrom here to y=8 at t=21, that's 9 turns, net increase 7, so I need at least 7 up moves, so in 9 turns, 7 up and 2 down or stay, but since I need to go up, probably 7 up and 2 stay or something, but y from 1 to 8, difference 7, so exactly 7 up with no down, but 7 actions in 7 turns? From t=12 to t=21, 9 turns.\n\nActions from t=12 to t=20 determine y13 to y21.\n\ny at t=21 is determined by actions from t=12 to t=20.\n\n8 actions for 8 changes? Let's index.\n\nAt turn t, after action a_t, y_{t+1}.\n\nAt turn t=12, y12=1.\n\nThen a12 determines y13, a13 y14, ..., a20 determines y21.\n\nSo actions a12 to a20, 9 actions, determine y13 to y21.\n\nI want y21=8.\n\nStart from y12=1, to y21=8, need +7, so 7 up moves, and 2 other moves (stay or down).\n\nIf I have down moves, it takes more up moves, so better to have stay or no down.\n\nWith 7 up and 2 stay, I can reach y21=1 +7 =8.\n\nFor example, a12 U, y13=2; a13 U, y14=3; a14 U, y15=4; a15 U, y16=5; but at t=16 y=5, and t=17 is coming.\n\nIf I go directly, a15 U to y16=5, then a16 U to y17=6, but at t=17 y=6 unsafe.\n\nSo I need to insert the stay or down to avoid.\n\nBut I also have to avoid being on y=5 or y=6 at t=17 and t=18.\n\nIn this case, at t=16 y=5, if I stay or down, I can avoid t=17 on y=6.\n\nThen later go up.\n\nBut for y=8 at t=21, I can do it.\n\nLet's try.\n\nt=12: y=1\n\na12: U, y13=2\n\na13: U, y14=3\n\na14: U, y15=4\n\na15: U, y16=5  -- t=16 y=5 safe\n\nNow at t=16, to avoid t=17 on y=5 or y=6, a16: D, y17=4  (go down to y=4)\n\nt=17: y=4, safe\n\na17: U, y18=5  -- but at t=18 y=5, unsafe! t=18 y=5 unsafe.\n\nMistake.\n\na17: U to y=5 at t=18, unsafe.\n\nSo a17: S, y18=4, safe\n\nThen a18: U, y19=5\n\nt=19: y=5 safe\n\na19: U, y20=6\n\nt=20: y=6 safe\n\na20: U, y21=7  -- but I wanted y21=8, but here y21=7\n\ny21=7, not 8.\n\nBecause I had two non-up moves: a16=D and a17=S, so only 6 up from t=12 to t=20, so y21=1+6=7.\n\nTo reach y=8, I need one more up, so at a20: U to y21=7, then I need a21 U to y22=8, but t=22 may be problem.\n\nBut let's continue.\n\nAt t=21 y=7, a21: U, y22=8, but t=22 y=8 unsafe.\n\nIf I add an action at t=21.\n\nBut for y=8 at t=21, I need to have y21=8.\n\nIn the above, with actions from t=12 to t=20, I have y21=7.\n\nTo have y21=8, I need one more up in the 9 actions.\n\nFor example, instead of a17=S, I could have a17=U, but that would go to y=5 at t=18, unsafe.\n\nNot possible.\n\nStart going up later or earlier.\n\nSince y=1 is safe, I can stay longer on y=1 to delay.\n\nFor example, at t=12 y=1, stay for 2 turns.\n\na12: S, y13=1\n\na13: S, y14=1\n\nThen start going up at t=14.\n\nt=14: y=1\n\na14: U, y15=2\n\na15: U, y16=3\n\na16: U, y17=4  -- t=17 y=4 safe\n\na17: U, y18=5  -- but at t=18 y=5, unsafe\n\nCollision.\n\na17: S, y18=4, safe\n\na18: U, y19=5\n\nt=19: y=5 safe\n\na19: U, y20=6\n\na20: U, y21=7\n\na21: U, y22=8 -- t=22 unsafe\n\nSame.\n\nTo avoid y=8 at t=22, I need to be on y=8 at t=21 or earlier, or after t=24.\n\nt=21 is turn 21.\n\nFrom start, t=10 to t=21 is 11 turns.\n\ny from 2 to 8, net +6.\n\nBut I have to be at y=1 at t=12, so let's set that.\n\nt=10: y=2, a10: D, y11=1\n\nt=11: y=1, a11: S, y12=1\n\nNow at t=12 y=1.\n\nI want to be at y=8 at t=21.\n\ny21=8.\n\nFrom y12=1 to y21=8, need +7 in 9 actions (a12 to a20).\n\nSo 7 up and 2 other.\n\nBut the other must not cause collision.\n\nAlso, I need to avoid y=5 and y=6 at t=17,18.\n\nt=17 and t=18 are within this range.\n\nSuppose I go up as much as possible, but avoid being at y=5 or y=6 at t=17 and t=18.\n\nFor example, at t=16, I can be at y=4 or y=5 or y=6, etc.\n\nAssume I go up from t=12.\n\na12: U, y13=2\n\na13: U, y14=3\n\na14: U, y15=4\n\na15: U, y16=5  -- t=16 y=5\n\nNow at t=16 y=5, if I go up, y17=6 at t=17 unsafe.\n\nSo a15: instead of U, but I need to go up.\n\nAt t=15, y=4 (after a14 U to y15=4? t=15 y=4.\n\na15: if I do not go up, say S, then y16=4\n\nt=16: y=4, safe\n\nThen a16: U, y17=5, but at t=17 y=5 unsafe\n\nOr a16: S, y17=4, safe, but then at t=17 y=4\n\nThen a17: U, y18=5, at t=18 unsafe.\n\nSo to avoid, I need to be at y<=4 or y>=7 at t=17 and t=18.\n\nBut from y=4 at t=16, I can only be at y=3,4,5 at t=17.\n\ny=5 unsafe, so only y=3 or 4.\n\nSimilarly at t=18.\n\nSo I can be at y=4 at t=17 and t=18.\n\nFor example:\n\nFrom t=15 y=4, a15: S, y16=4\n\nt=16: y=4, a16: S, y17=4\n\nt=17: y=4, a17: S, y18=4\n\nt=18: y=4, safe\n\nThen a18: U, y19=5\n\n etc.\n\nBut this takes many stays.\n\nThen y19=5, a19: U, y20=6, a20: U, y21=7\n\nNot 8.\n\nTo reach y=8 at t=21, I need to go up more.\n\nBut with the stays, I have fewer up moves.\n\nSo impossible to reach y=8 at t=21 with the constraints.\n\nMinimal y at t=21 with max up: from t=12 y=1, 9 actions, 9 up, y21=10, but y max 9, so y21=9 with 8 up and one down or something, but let's not.\n\nSince I can't reach y=8 at t=21 easily, I should aim to be on y=8 after t=24.\n\nBut that is late.\n\nFirst, let's ignore y=8 for now and focus on the earlier parts.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=9 directly from lower, but y=9 is safe.\n\nAnother idea: since y=0 is safe, I could go down to y=0 and stay, but that wastes more time.\n\nNot good.\n\nPerhaps for the t=17,18 problem, I can be on y=7 at that time.\n\ny=7 is safe at t=17,18.\n\nBut to be on y=7 at t=17, from start.\n\nAt t=10 y=2, to y=7 at t=17, net +5 in 7 turns, possible with 5 up and 2 down or stay, but I need to be at y=1 at t=12.\n\nt=10: a10: D, y11=1\n\nt=11: a11: S, y12=1\n\nt=12: y=1\n\nThen to y=7 at t=17, that's 5 turns, net +6, impossible in 5 turns from y=1, max y=6 at t=17.\n\nFrom t=12 y=1, actions a12 to a16 determine y13 to y17.\n\n5 actions, to y17.\n\nStart y12=1, after 5 actions, y17 = 1 + sum Δy, each Δy <=1, so y17 <= 6.\n\nSimilarly, to be at y=7 at t=17, impossible from y=1 at t=12.\n\nMax at t=17 is y=6.\n\nBut y=6 unsafe at t=17.\n\nSo I cannot be on y=6 at t=17.\n\nSimilarly, y=5 unsafe.\n\nSo at t=17, I must be on y<=4 or y=7 or 8.\n\ny=7 or 8 possible if I start higher, but I start from low.\n\nFrom t=12 y=1, at t=17, after 5 actions, y17 <=6, so only possible safe y at t=17 are y=0,1,2,3,4,7 but y=7 impossible, so only y=0 to 4.\n\nSimilarly for t=18.\n\nSo I have to be on y<=4 at t=17 and t=18 to avoid collision.\n\nThen after that, go up to y=9.\n\nBut for y=8, I need to avoid t=22,23,24.\n\nLet's define a path that avoids all.\n\nStart:\n\nt=10: y=2, a10: D, y11=1  (down to avoid t=12 on higher y)\n\nt=11: y=1, a11: S, y12=1  (stay to be safe at t=12)\n\nt=12: y=1, safe\n\nNow, I need to be on y<=4 at t=17 and t=18.\n\nt=17 is 5 turns after t=12, t=12 to t=17 is 5 turns.\n\nFrom y=1 at t=12, after 5 actions (a12 to a16), y17 is determined.\n\nI want y17 <=4.\n\nSimilarly, for t=18, but if y17<=4, I can keep it low.\n\nAlso, I need to go up eventually.\n\nTo minimize time, I should go up as much as possible but ensure that at t=17 and t=18, y<=4.\n\nFor example, go up to y=4 as fast as possible, then stay there until after t=18.\n\nFrom t=12 y=1:\n\na12: U, y13=2\n\na13: U, y14=3\n\na14: U, y15=4\n\nNow at t=15 y=4.\n\nThen a15: S, y16=4\n\na16: S, y17=4  -- t=17 y=4 safe\n\na17: S, y18=4  -- t=18 y=4 safe\n\nThen after t=18, go up.\n\na18: U, y19=5\n\nt=19: y=5, safe (not 17,18)\n\na19: U, y20=6\n\nt=20: y=6, safe\n\na20: U, y21=7\n\nt=21: y=7, safe\n\na21: U, y22=8\n\nt=22: y=8, but unsafe at t=22\n\nNow at t=22 y=8 unsafe.\n\nTo avoid, at t=21 y=7, I can stay: a21: S, y22=7, safe at t=22.\n\nThen a22: U, y23=8, but t=23 y=8 unsafe.\n\na22: U to y=8 at t=23, unsafe.\n\na22: S, y23=7, safe.\n\nThen a23: U, y24=8, t=24 y=8 unsafe.\n\nSo I need to stay on y=7 until t=24.\n\nAt t=21 y=7, a21: S, y22=7\n\nt=22: y=7, a22: S, y23=7\n\nt=23: y=7, a23: S, y24=7\n\nt=24: y=7, a24: U, y25=8\n\nt=25: y=8, now t=25, ΔT=15, safe for y=8.\n\nThen a25: U, y26=9\n\nt=26: y=9, reached.\n\nNow, this works, but many turns.\n\nH is the number of actions.\n\nActions from t=10 to t=25.\n\nt=10 to t=25 is 16 actions? Let's list the turns.\n\nActions: a10 to a25 for y at t=11 to t=26.\n\nAt turn t=26, y=9.\n\nSo actions from t=10 to t=25, that's 16 actions.\n\nBut min is 7, so this is not minimal.\n\nI can reduce by going up faster where possible.\n\nFor example, after t=18, I can go up faster.\n\nIn the above, from t=18 y=4, I went up each turn to y=7 at t=21.\n\nBut at t=21 I am at y=7, and I stayed until t=24 to go to y=8 at t=25.\n\nBut I can go to y=8 earlier if I can before t=22.\n\nFor example, at t=19 y=5, t=20 y=6, t=21 y=7, as above.\n\nTo be on y=8 at t=21, but from y=1 at t=12, to y=8 at t=21, need +7 in 9 actions, so possible with 7 up and 2 stay, for example.\n\nBut earlier I had trouble with t=17 and t=18.\n\nLet's try to have the stays before.\n\nFrom t=12 y=1:\n\na12: U, y13=2\n\na13: U, y14=3\n\na14: U, y15=4\n\na15: S, y16=4  -- stay at y=4\n\na16: S, y17=4  -- t=17 y=4\n\na17: S, y18=4  -- t=18 y=4\n\na18: U, y19=5\n\na19: U, y20=6\n\na20: U, y21=7  -- t=21 y=7\n\nBut I want y21=8, so I need one more up.\n\nFor example, a20: U to y21=7, not 8.\n\nTo have y21=8, I need an additional up, so a20: U to y21=7, then a21: U to y22=8, but t=22 unsafe.\n\nNot good.\n\nHave one less stay.\n\nFor example, a12: U, y13=2\n\na13: U, y14=3\n\na14: U, y15=4\n\na15: U, y16=5  -- t=16 y=5\n\nThen to avoid t=17, a16: D, y17=4  -- go down\n\nt=17: y=4, safe\n\na17: S, y18=4  -- stay, t=18 y=4 safe\n\na18: U, y19=5\n\na19: U, y20=6\n\na20: U, y21=7  -- y21=7\n\nSame as before.\n\nThen from here, to reach y=9, I need to go to y=8 and y=9, but with y=8 unsafe at t=22,23,24.\n\nAt t=21 y=7, I can go to y=8 at t=22, unsafe.\n\nSo I must stay on y=7 until t=24.\n\na21: S, y22=7\n\na22: S, y23=7\n\na23: S, y24=7\n\na24: U, y25=8\n\nt=25: y=8, safe\n\na25: U, y26=9\n\nt=26: y=9\n\nActions from a10 to a25, 16 actions.\n\nBut I can reach y=9 faster by going to y=8 at a safe time.\n\nFor example, if I can be on y=8 at t=21.\n\nBut from above, I am at y=7 at t=21.\n\nSo one less.\n\nOr at t=25 I am at y=8, then to y=9 at t=26.\n\nBut t=26 is late.\n\nSince the player can go down to y=0, but that might not help.\n\nAnother idea: for the y=8 unsafe at t=22,23,24, I can be on y=9 before t=22.\n\nFor example, at t=21 on y=9.\n\nBut from start, with delays, difficult.\n\nMin time: from t=10 y=2 to y=9 at t=17 is 7 actions.\n\nBut with t=12 constraint, I had to go down and stay, so lost at least 2 turns.\n\nThen for t=17,18, I had to go down or stay, lost more.\n\nIn the first part, to handle t=12, I used 2 actions: D and S.\n\nThen to handle t=17,18, in the path, I used D and S or something.\n\nIn the sequence where I went to y=5 at t=16, then down to y=4 at t=17, stay at t=18, then up, so for t=17,18, I used 2 actions with no progress or negative.\n\nThen for y=8, I stayed 3 turns on y=7.\n\nSo total extra actions.\n\nBut perhaps I can combine the waiting.\n\nFor example, at y=4, I stayed for t=16,17,18, which covered both the t=17,18 avoidance and also delayed the ascent for y=8.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nFrom t=15 y=4, I stayed at y=4 for t=16,17,18 with actions a15=S, a16=S, a17=S.\n\nThen at t=18 y=4, go up.\n\nBut to reach y=9 faster, after t=18, go up continuously.\n\na18: U, y19=5\n\na19: U, y20=6\n\na20: U, y21=7\n\na21: U, y22=8  -- unsafe\n\nBut at t=21 y=7, if I stay one more turn, a21: S, y22=7, then a22: U, y23=8 unsafe.\n\nSo I need to stay until t=24.\n\na21: S, y22=7\n\na22: S, y23=7\n\na23: S, y24=7\n\na24: U, y25=8\n\na25: U, y26=9\n\nSo from t=18 y=4 to t=26 y=9, 8 actions for 5 steps, with 3 stays.\n\nNot efficient.\n\nAt t=20 y=6, I can go to y=7 at t=21, then stay, but same.\n\nTo save time, I should go up to y=7 as fast as possible after t=18, then stay on y=7 until after t=24.\n\nBut y=7 is safe, so staying there is fine.\n\nFrom t=18 y=4:\n\na18: U, y19=5\n\na19: U, y20=6\n\na20: U, y21=7  -- now at y=7 at t=21\n\nThen stay: a21: S, y22=7\n\na22: S, y23=7\n\na23: S, y24=7\n\na24: U, y25=8\n\na25: U, y26=9\n\nt=26 y=9.\n\nNumber of actions from start.\n\nStart: a10: D ( to y11=1)\n\na11: S (y12=1)\n\nThen a12: U (y13=2)\n\na13: U (y14=3)\n\na14: U (y15=4)\n\na15: S (y16=4)  -- stay at y=4 for t=16\n\na16: S (y17=4)  -- t=17\n\na17: S (y18=4)  -- t=18\n\nThen a18: U (y19=5)\n\na19: U (y20=6)\n\na20: U (y21=7)\n\na21: S (y22=7)\n\na22: S (y23=7)\n\na23: S (y24=7)\n\na24: U (y25=8)\n\na25: U (y26=9)\n\nSo actions from a10 to a25, 16 actions.\n\nH=16, turns from t=10 to t=25, at t=25 action, y at t=26=9.\n\nBut perhaps I can reduce the stays.\n\nFor example, at the beginning, for t=12, I only need to be at y=1 at t=12, so I can go down at t=10 to y=1 at t=11, then at t=11, I can go to y=0 or something, but y=0 is safe, but then I have to come back.\n\nNot better.\n\nAt t=11 on y=1, I can go up to y=2 at t=12, but y=2 unsafe at t=12, so I must not be on y=2 at t=12, so I have to stay or go down to y=0 or y=1.\n\nSo no choice.\n\nFor t=17,18, I have to be at y<=4.\n\nIn the above, I stayed at y=4 from t=15 to t=18, 4 turns at y=4, but I could have reached y=4 earlier.\n\nFrom t=12 y=1, I can go up in 3 actions to y=4 at t=15.\n\nThen I need to stay until after t=18, so at least until t=19 to go up.\n\nBut at t=18, I can go up to y=5 at t=19, which is safe.\n\nBut for y=8, I still have the problem.\n\nTo save time on the y=8 part, if I can be on y=8 at t=21, then I can go to y=9 at t=22, but t=22 y=8 unsafe if I am on it, but if I go to y=9 at t=22, I am on y=8 at t=22 only if I stay, but when I go from y=7 to y=8 at t=22, at turn t=22, I am on y=7 if I move at t=22, let's see.\n\nAt turn t=22, if I am on y=7, and I choose a22=U, then I move to y=8 at t=23.\n\nAt turn t=22, I am on y=7, so for collision, only cars on y=7 matter, which is safe.\n\nThen at t=23, I am on y=8, which may be unsafe.\n\nBut if I go directly to y=9.\n\nFor example, at t=21 y=7, a21: U, y22=8, but at t=22, when I am on y=7 (since I move at t=22 to y=8, but at the turn t=22, before action, I am on y=7, so no collision with y=8 cars.\n\nThen after action, I am on y=8 for t=23.\n\nAt t=23, I am on y=8, which is unsafe if t=23.\n\nBut if I go to y=9 at t=23.\n\na21: U from y=7 to y=8 at t=22? Let's clarify.\n\nAt turn t=21, I am at y=7.\n\nI choose action a21.\n\nIf a21=U, then y22 = 7+1=8.\n\nSo at turn t=22, I am at y=8.\n\nFor collision at turn T, it is when I am on y_T at that turn.\n\nSo at t=22, if I am on y=8, and y=8 is unsafe at t=22, collision.\n\nIf I choose a21=S, then y22=7, at t=22 on y=7, safe.\n\nThen a22=U, y23=8, at t=23 on y=8, unsafe.\n\n etc.\n\nTo reach y=9, I need to be on y=8 at some point.\n\nThe only safe way is to be on y=8 before t=22 or after t=24.\n\nSince after t=24 is late, before t=22.\n\nFor example, at t=21 on y=8, safe.\n\nThen a21: U, y22=9, at t=22 on y=9, safe.\n\nPerfect.\n\nSo if I can be on y=8 at t=21, then I can go to y=9 at t=22.\n\nNo problem with y=8 unsafe times.\n\nNow, can I reach y=8 at t=21 from start with the constraints?\n\nStart t=10 y=2.\n\nMust be at y=1 at t=11 and t=12 for t=12 safety.\n\nSo a10: D, y11=1\n\na11: S, y12=1\n\nNow at t=12 y=1.\n\nWant y21=8.\n\nActions a12 to a20 determine y13 to y21.\n\n9 actions.\n\ny12=1 to y21=8, need +7, so 7 up and 2 other actions (stay or down).\n\nThe other actions must be used to avoid being on y=5 or y=6 at t=17 and t=18.\n\nt=17 and t=18 are within.\n\nLet's list the turns for y.\n\nAt t=12: y=1\n\nAfter a12: y13 = 1 + Δy12\n\nAfter a13: y14 = y13 + Δy13\n\n...\n\nAfter a20: y21 = y20 + Δy20\n\ny at each turn t must be safe.\n\nFor t=17 and t=18, y_t <=4 or >=7, but since max y at t=17 is 6, so y_t <=4.\n\nSo y17 <=4 and y18 <=4.\n\ny17 is determined after a16, since a16 determines y17.\n\nSimilarly, y18 after a17.\n\ny17 = y16 + Δy16\n\nBut y16 depends on previous.\n\nTo have y17 <=4 and y18 <=4.\n\nSince I start from y=1 at t=12, and go up, I can go to y=4 quickly, then stay.\n\nFor example:\n\na12: U, y13=2\n\na13: U, y14=3\n\na14: U, y15=4  -- now at t=15 y=4\n\nThen to keep y<=4 for t=17 and t=18, I can stay:\n\na15: S, y16=4\n\na16: S, y17=4  -- t=17 y=4 <=4\n\na17: S, y18=4  -- t=18 y=4 <=4\n\nNow, I have used 5 actions so far: a12 U, a13 U, a14 U, a15 S, a16 S, a17 S\n\ny18=4\n\nNow I need to reach y21=8.\n\nFrom t=18 y=4, to y21=8, need +4 in 3 actions: a18, a19, a20.\n\nWith 3 actions, I can go to y=7 at most, since y19=5, y20=6, y21=7 with three U.\n\ny21=7, not 8.\n\nBut I need y21=8, so impossible with this.\n\nIf I use one less stay, but then y17 or y18 may be high.\n\nFor example, if I don't have a17 S, but a17 U, then y18=5, but at t=18 y=5 unsafe.\n\nNot good.\n\nIf I go up slower.\n\nFor example, a12: U, y13=2\n\na13: U, y14=3\n\na14: S, y15=3  -- stay at y=3\n\na15: U, y16=4\n\na16: S, y17=4  -- t=17 y=4\n\na17: S, y18=4  -- t=18 y=4\n\nThen a18: U, y19=5\n\na19: U, y20=6\n\na20: U, y21=7  -- still y21=7\n\nSame.\n\nOr to get to y=8, I need an additional up, but no room.\n\nWith 9 actions, if I have only 6 up, y21=1+6=7.\n\nIf I have 7 up, y21=1+7=8, but I must have two non-up actions to avoid the unsafe times.\n\nBut with non-up actions, I may be at lower y at some points.\n\nFor example, suppose I go up to y=4, then down to y=3, then up, but that might not help.\n\na12: U, y13=2\n\na13: U, y14=3\n\na14: U, y15=4\n\na15: D, y16=3  -- go down to avoid\n\nt=16: y=3\n\na16: U, y17=4  -- t=17 y=4\n\na17: S, y18=4  -- t=18 y=4\n\nThen a18: U, y19=5\n\na19: U, y20=6\n\na20: U, y21=7  -- y21=7\n\nStill 7.\n\nIf I have only one non-up, but I need two for the two unsafe turns or something.\n\nI think it's impossible to reach y=8 at t=21 with the constraints.\n\nTherefore, the earlier path with 16 actions is probably the way to go, but I can output that.\n\nBut let's confirm if there is a shorter path.\n\nPerhaps for the y=5 and y=6 unsafe at t=17,18, I can be on y=7 at that time.\n\nBut as before, impossible from low start.\n\nOr I can go to y=8 directly, but no.\n\nAnother idea: since freeway 1 is always safe, I could go to y=1 and stay, but not helpful.\n\nOr for the t=12, I can be on y=0 at t=12, but same as y=1.\n\nI think 16 actions is the best I can do.\n\nSo let's write the sequence.\n\nTurn t_1 = 10.\n\nPlayer position at turn 10: (0,2)\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 10: D  ( to go to y=1 at t=11)\n\nTurn 11: S  ( stay to be at y=1 at t=12)\n\nTurn 12: U  ( to y=2 at t=13)\n\nTurn 13: U  ( to y=3 at t=14)\n\nTurn 14: U  ( to y=4 at t=15)\n\nTurn 15: S  ( stay at y=4 for t=16)\n\nTurn 16: S  ( stay at y=4 for t=17)\n\nTurn 17: S  ( stay at y=4 for t=18)\n\nTurn 18: U  ( to y=5 at t=19)\n\nTurn 19: U  ( to y=6 at t=20)\n\nTurn 20: U  ( to y=7 at t=21)\n\nTurn 21: S  ( stay at y=7 for t=22)\n\nTurn 22: S  ( stay at y=7 for t=23)\n\nTurn 23: S  ( stay at y=7 for t=24)\n\nTurn 24: U  ( to y=8 at t=25)\n\nTurn 25: U  ( to y=9 at t=26)\n\nAt turn 26, y=9, reached.\n\nH=16 actions, from t=10 to t=25.\n\nThe sequence is for t from 10 to 25, 16 actions.\n\nIn the answer, it should be listed as Turn t_1: a_{t_1}, etc.\n\nt_1=10.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 10: D\n\nTurn 11: S\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: S\n\nTurn 16: S\n\nTurn 17: S\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nTurn 20: U\n\nTurn 21: S\n\nTurn 22: S\n\nTurn 23: S\n\nTurn 24: U\n\nTurn 25: U\n\nNow, at turn 25, action U, to y=9 at t=26.\n\nBut the position at turn t=26 is (0,9).\n\nAnd no collision, as per above.\n\nTo save one action, at the end, when I go to y=8 at t=25, I can go to y=9 at t=26 with a25: U.\n\nBut I need to have the action.\n\nH=16.\n\nPerhaps I can start going up earlier or later.\n\nFor example, after t=18, I am at y=4, I go up to y=7 at t=21, then stay until t=24, but at t=24 I go to y=8, t=25 y=8 safe, then to y=9.\n\nBut t=24 action to y=8 at t=25.\n\nSame as above.\n\nI think it's minimal under constraints.\n\nSo I'll go with this.\n</think>\nTo reach the position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 2) at turn \\(t_1 = 10\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 16. The sequence of actions ensures that the player is never on a freeway at a turn when it is unsafe (i.e., when a car's span includes x=0 on that freeway).\n\n### Unsafe Times for Each Freeway:\n- **Freeway 1 (y=1)**: Always safe.\n- **Freeway 2 (y=2)**: Unsafe only at turn 12.\n- **Freeway 3 (y=3)**: Unsafe only at turn 12.\n- **Freeway 4 (y=4)**: Unsafe only at turn 12.\n- **Freeway 5 (y=5)**: Unsafe at turns 10, 11, 17, and 18.\n- **Freeway 6 (y=6)**: Unsafe at turns 10, 11, 17, and 18.\n- **Freeway 7 (y=7)**: Unsafe only at turn 12.\n- **Freeway 8 (y=8)**: Unsafe at turns 22, 23, and 24.\n\n### Strategy:\n- **Avoid turn 12 on unsafe freeways (y=2,3,4,7)**: Be on y=1 (safe) at turn 12 by moving down to y=1 at turn 11 and staying there.\n- **Avoid turns 17 and 18 on y=5 and y=6**: After reaching y=4, stay there from turns 16 to 18 to remain safe.\n- **Avoid turns 22, 23, and 24 on y=8**: After reaching y=7 at turn 21, stay there until turn 24 to move to y=8 at turn 25 (safe), then move to y=9.\n\n### Action Sequence:\nThe sequence of actions from turn 10 to turn 25 (16 actions) results in the player reaching (0, 9) at turn 26:\n- Turn 10: Move down (D) to y=1 at turn 11 (safe, as y=2 is safe at turn 10).\n- Turn 11: Stay (S) to remain at y=1 at turn 12 (safe, as y=1 is always safe).\n- Turn 12: Move up (U) to y=2 at turn 13 (safe, as y=1 is safe at turn 12).\n- Turn 13: Move up (U) to y=3 at turn 14 (safe, as y=2 is safe except at turn 12).\n- Turn 14: Move up (U) to y=4 at turn 15 (safe, as y=3 is safe except at turn 12).\n- Turn 15: Stay (S) to remain at y=4 at turn 16 (safe, as y=4 is safe except at turn 12).\n- Turn 16: Stay (S) to remain at y=4 at turn 17 (safe, and avoids y=5/y=6 at turn 17).\n- Turn 17: Stay (S) to remain at y=4 at turn 18 (safe, and avoids y=5/y=6 at turn 18).\n- Turn 18: Move up (U) to y=5 at turn 19 (safe, as t=19 not unsafe for y=5).\n- Turn 19: Move up (U) to y=6 at turn 20 (safe, as t=20 not unsafe for y=6).\n- Turn 20: Move up (U) to y=7 at turn 21 (safe, as y=7 is safe except at turn 12).\n- Turn 21: Stay (S) to remain at y=7 at turn 22 (safe, and avoids y=8 at turn 22).\n- Turn 22: Stay (S) to remain at y=7 at turn 23 (safe, and avoids y=8 at turn 23).\n- Turn 23: Stay (S) to remain at y=7 at turn 24 (safe, and avoids y=8 at turn 24).\n- Turn 24: Move up (U) to y=8 at turn 25 (safe, as t=25 not unsafe for y=8).\n- Turn 25: Move up (U) to y=9 at turn 26 (safe, as y=9 has no cars).\n\nThis sequence minimizes \\(H = 16\\) by strategically waiting at safe positions to avoid collisions, ensuring the player reaches (0, 9) in the fewest turns possible.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 10: D \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 14: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 15: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 16: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 17: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 18: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 19: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 20: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 21: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 22: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 23: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 24: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 25: U \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t1=12, and I start at y=0.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how the cars move. For each freeway, there are cars with positions given at turn t1=12. Since they're moving, I need to figure out where they are at future turns to avoid collisions.\n\nThe collision rule says that at turn T, if I'm at y_T, and for any car on that freeway, 0 is in the span at that turn, I collide. But note that when I move, I'm not on the new row until the next turn. So if I move from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T I'm still on y, and at T+1 I'm on y+1.\n\nAlso, the player position updates as: U for up (y+1), D for down (y-1), S for stay (y same). And y must be between 0 and 9 inclusive.\n\nI start at y=0 at t=12. I need to reach y=9.\n\nThe minimal H should be at least 9, since I need to move up 9 units, but I can move down or stay, so it might be more, but probably I want to go up as much as possible.\n\nBut there are cars blocking, so I have to avoid them.\n\nFirst, let's list all the cars and their positions at t=12, and how they move.\n\nFor each car, the span is given as (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nFor left-moving cars, head is to the right, tail to the left, I think? Let me see the update.\n\nFor left-moving: span at t1 is [h, τ], and at T, it's [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nSimilarly, right-moving: [τ, h] at t1, and at T, [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nIn the table, for freeway 1: (-48, -71, right, 24)\n\nDirection right, so I think head and tail: since it's right-moving, the span should be [τ, h] with τ < h? But here it's (-48, -71), and -48 > -71, so τ = -71, h = -48? The notation says (head, tail), but for right-moving, it should be tail then head? I'm confused.\n\nLook back:\n\nFor car k on freeway i, head at h, tail at τ.\n\nThen for left-moving: span [h, τ] → [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT]\n\nFor right-moving: span [τ, h] → [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT]\n\nIn the input, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed)\n\nFor freeway 1: (-48, -71, right, 24)\n\nDirection right, so for right-moving, the span should be [τ, h], so here τ = -71, h = -48? But -71 is less than -48, so [τ, h] = [-71, -48]\n\nThen at time T, span [ -71 + 24*(T-12), -48 + 24*(T-12) ]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut in the list, for freeway 5, there are multiple cars: (48,37,right,6), (12,1,right,6), (-24,-35,right,6)\n\nFor right-moving, each should be [tail, head], so for first car: (48,37) with direction right, but 48>37, so if head is 48, tail is 37, but for right-moving, head should be greater than tail? I think I need to interpret the (head, tail) based on direction.\n\nAssume that for any car, head and tail are given, and for left-moving, head > tail, for right-moving, head < tail? But in freeway 1, (-48,-71,right,24), -48 > -71, and direction right, so head is -48, tail is -71, but for right-moving, the span is [τ, h] with τ < h, so here τ = -71, h = -48, so [ -71, -48 ].\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 5, first car (48,37,right,6): 48>37, so head=48, tail=37, direction right, so span [37,48] at t=12.\n\n(12,1,right,6): head=12, tail=1, span [1,12]\n\n(-24,-35,right,6): head=-24, tail=-35, so span [-35,-24]\n\nAnd they all move right, so position increases with time.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but in this case, all cars are right-moving except? Let's list all.\n\nFreeway 1: (-48,-71,right,24) → right-moving, span [-71,-48] at t=12\n\nFreeway 2: (-48,-83,right,36) → [-83,-48] at t=12\n\nFreeway 3: same as 2? (-48,-83,right,36) → [-83,-48]\n\nFreeway 4: same, (-48,-83,right,36) → [-83,-48]\n\nFreeway 5: three cars: (48,37,right,6) → [37,48], (12,1,right,6) → [1,12], (-24,-35,right,6) → [-35,-24]\n\nFreeway 6: same as 5: (48,37,right,6), (12,1,right,6), (-24,-35,right,6)\n\nFreeway 7: (48,37,right,12) → [37,48] at t=12\n\nFreeway 8: (48,37,right,4) → [37,48] at t=12\n\nAll cars are right-moving, so they are all moving to the right, position increasing.\n\nNow, the collision happens at turn T if the player is on freeway k at turn T, and for some car on k, 0 is in the car's span at that turn.\n\nThe span is the set of x-coordinates covered by the car, and since the player is at x=0, we care if 0 is between the left and right ends.\n\nFor right-moving car, span [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] at time T, where ΔT = T - t1 = T - 12.\n\nCollision if τ + sΔT ≤ 0 ≤ h + sΔT for that car.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but all are right here.\n\nThe player is at (0, y_t), so for each turn, y_t determines which freeway we're on.\n\nAt turn T, if y_T = k, and for some car on freeway k, 0 is in the span at T, collision.\n\nNote that y_t changes based on action.\n\nI start at t=12, y=0. y=0 is not a freeway, I think freeways are y=1 to 8, so at y=0 and y=9, no cars, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=9 is the goal, no cars.\n\nSo I need to get to y=9.\n\nThe minimal H should be 9 if I can go straight up with no delays, but there might be cars blocking on some rows at some times.\n\nSince I start at t=12, y=0, and I can take actions to move up, down, or stay.\n\nEach move changes y by +1, -1, or 0.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nThe number of turns H includes the starting turn, I think? Let's see the sequence.\n\nThe sequence is for t from t1 to t1+H-1, and y_{t1+H-1} =9.\n\nAt turn t, we take action a_t, then y_{t+1} is updated.\n\nDefine the turns carefully.\n\nAt the beginning of turn t, player is at position y_t.\n\nThen we choose action a_t, which determines Δy_t, and then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nThen at turn t, we are on row y_t.\n\nCollision at turn t if on row y_t, and 0 in span for that row at time t.\n\nThen after action, we move to y_{t+1} for turn t+1.\n\nIn the sequence, for t from t1 to t1+H-1, we have actions, and after H actions, we have y_{t1+H} =9? Let's see.\n\nStart at turn t1, position y_{t1} =0.\n\nAfter action a_{t1}, y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + Δy.\n\nThen at turn t1+1, position y_{t1+1}, and so on.\n\nWe want y_{t1 + H} =9 for some H, and the sequence of actions from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nThe sequence {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, so a_{t1} to a_{t1+H-1}, and y_{t1+H} = y_{t1} + sum of Δy from t=t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nSince y_{t1} =0, y_{t1+H} = sum of Δy for t=t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nAnd we want y_{t1+H} =9.\n\nEach Δy is +1,0,-1, so to increase by 9, we need at least 9 up moves, and possibly some down or stay, so H >=9.\n\nThe minimal H is at least 9, achieved if all actions are U.\n\nBut we have to avoid being on a row when a car is covering x=0.\n\nSince rows 1-8 have cars, I need to be on row k only when no car on k has 0 in its span at that time.\n\nFor each row k and time T, I can compute if it is safe to be on row k at time T, meaning that for all cars on row k, 0 not in span at T.\n\nThen, I need to find a path from (t=12, y=0) to some (t=12+H, y=9) with actions, such that at each time T, the row y_T is safe.\n\ny_T is the position at time T, before action, I think.\n\nAt time T, position is y_T, we are on row y_T, and we check collision for that row at that time.\n\nThen we take action a_T, go to y_{T+1}.\n\nSo for the path, for each time from t=12 to t=12+H-1, we have y_T, and it must be safe at that time, and y_{12+H} =9.\n\ny_{12+H} is the position after the last action at t=12+H-1.\n\nLet T_start = t1 =12.\n\nAt time T, position y_T.\n\nAfter action a_T, y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy_T.\n\nWe want y_{T_start + H} =9.\n\nThe actions are from t=T_start to T_start + H -1, total H actions.\n\nAt each time t from T_start to T_start + H -1, we are on row y_t, and it must be safe.\n\ny_{T_start + H} is not visited until after the last action, so we don't check collision at time T_start + H if we are at y=9, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly, at start, y=0 at t=12, safe.\n\nNow, let's find for each row k=1 to 8, and for each time T >=12, whether it is safe.\n\nFirst, for a given row k and time T, safe if for all cars on k, 0 not in their span at T.\n\nΔT = T - 12.\n\nFor each car, span at T.\n\nSince all cars are right-moving, span [τ + s ΔT, h + s ΔT] for that car, and collision if τ + s ΔT <= 0 <= h + s ΔT.\n\nBut τ and h are as given, with head and tail.\n\nFor example, freeway 1: one car with τ = -71, h = -48, s=24, direction right.\n\nAt time T, span [ -71 + 24*(T-12), -48 + 24*(T-12) ]\n\nCollision if -71 + 24(ΔT) <= 0 <= -48 + 24(ΔT)\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSince ΔT = T-12, let's set t' = T - 12, so t' >=0.\n\nFor freeway 1: car span [ -71 + 24 t', -48 + 24 t' ]\n\nCollision if min <= 0 <= max, so if -71 + 24t' <= 0 and 0 <= -48 + 24t'\n\nWhich is 24t' <= 71 and 48 <= 24t'\n\nSo t' <= 71/24 ≈ 2.958, and t' >= 48/24 = 2\n\nSo for t' between 2 and 2.958, i.e., t' =2 or 3? t' integer, T integer, so t' = T-12.\n\nt' >=2 and t' <=2.958, so t'=2 only? 24*2=48, -48+48=0, so at t'=2, -48 +24*2 = -48+48=0, so 0 <=0, which is included, so collision at t'=2.\n\nAt t'=2, T=14, span [ -71+48, -48+48] = [-23, 0], so 0 is included, collision.\n\nAt t'=3, T=15, span [ -71+72, -48+72] = [1,24], 0 not in, safe.\n\nAt t'=1, T=13, span [ -71+24, -48+24] = [-47,-24], 0 not in, safe.\n\nAt t'=0, T=12, span [-71,-48], 0 not in.\n\nSo for freeway 1, unsafe only at t'=2, T=14.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: (-48,-83,right,36), so τ=-83, h=-48, s=36\n\nSpan at t': [ -83 + 36 t', -48 + 36 t' ]\n\nCollision if -83 +36t' <=0 <= -48 +36t'\n\nSo 36t' <=83 and 48 <=36t'\n\nt' <=83/36≈2.305, t'>=48/36=4/3≈1.333\n\nSo t' from 1.333 to 2.305, so t'=2 only.\n\nAt t'=2, T=14, span [ -83+72, -48+72] = [-11,24], 0 in, collision.\n\nAt t'=1, T=13, [ -83+36, -48+36] = [-47,-12], 0 not in.\n\nAt t'=3, [ -83+108, -48+108] = [25,60], safe.\n\nSo unsafe at T=14.\n\nFreeway 3: same as 2, (-48,-83,right,36), so same, unsafe only at T=14.\n\nFreeway 4: same, unsafe at T=14.\n\nNow freeway 5: multiple cars.\n\nFirst car: (48,37,right,6), head=48, tail=37, so span [37 + 6t', 48 + 6t']\n\nCollision if 37+6t' <=0 <=48+6t'\n\nBut 37+6t' >=37>0 for t'>=0, so never <=0, so no collision ever from this car. Since min is at least 37>0.\n\nSimilarly, second car: (12,1,right,6), span [1 +6t', 12+6t']\n\nCollision if 1+6t' <=0 <=12+6t'\n\n1+6t' >=1>0, so never <=0, no collision.\n\nThird car: (-24,-35,right,6), head=-24, tail=-35, span [-35 +6t', -24 +6t']\n\nCollision if -35+6t' <=0 <= -24+6t'\n\nSo 6t' <=35 and 24 <=6t'\n\nt' <=35/6≈5.833, t'>=24/6=4\n\nSo t' from 4 to 5.833, so t'=4,5\n\nAt t'=4, T=16, span [-35+24, -24+24] = [-11,0], 0 in.\n\nAt t'=5, T=17, [-35+30, -24+30] = [-5,6], 0 in.\n\nAt t'=6, T=18, [-35+36, -24+36] = [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo unsafe at T=16 and T=17.\n\nFreeway 6: same as freeway 5, so unsafe at T=16 and T=17.\n\nFreeway 7: (48,37,right,12), span [37 +12t', 48+12t']\n\nMin 37>0, so no collision ever.\n\nFreeway 8: (48,37,right,4), span [37 +4t', 48+4t']\n\nMin 37>0, no collision.\n\nNow, summarize for each row and time when it is unsafe.\n\nFor row 1: unsafe at T=14\n\nRow 2: unsafe at T=14\n\nRow 3: unsafe at T=14\n\nRow 4: unsafe at T=14\n\nRow 5: unsafe at T=16 and T=17\n\nRow 6: unsafe at T=16 and T=17\n\nRow 7: always safe\n\nRow 8: always safe\n\nRows 7 and 8 are always safe, no cars that can cover x=0.\n\nRow 7 has a car but min position 37>0, so never covers 0, similarly row 8.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=0 at t=12 to y=9 at some t=12+H.\n\nSince y=0 and y=9 are safe, I need to cross rows 1 to 8.\n\nThe unsafe times are:\n\nAt T=14, rows 1,2,3,4 are unsafe.\n\nAt T=16 and 17, rows 5 and 6 are unsafe.\n\nI need to be on each row at some time when it is safe.\n\nSince I move one row at a time, I need to pass through each row sequentially, but I can stay or move down, so I might not go directly up.\n\nTo minimize H, I should go up as fast as possible, but avoid the unsafe times.\n\nStart at t=12, y=0.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nThe minimal H is 9, if I go up every turn.\n\nBut let's see if I can go up from t=12 to t=20, y=8 at t=20, then to y=9 at t=21? Let's compute positions.\n\nAt t=12, y=0\n\nAfter a12, y13 = y12 + Δy12\n\nAt time t, position y_t.\n\nAfter action at t, y_{t+1}.\n\nSo sequence:\n\nt=12: position y12=0, take action a12, then y13 = 0 + Δy12\n\nt=13: position y13, take a13, y14 = y13 + Δy13\n\n...\n\nt=12+H-1: position y_{12+H-1}, take a_{12+H-1}, y_{12+H} = y_{12+H-1} + Δy_{12+H-1} =9\n\nAnd at each t from 12 to 12+H-1, position y_t must be safe, meaning if y_t between 1 and 8, not unsafe at that t.\n\ny_t is the row at time t.\n\nFor minimal H, start with H=9.\n\nThen actions: all U, so y_t = t - 12 for t from 12 to 20? Let's see.\n\nt=12: y12=0\n\na12=U, y13=1\n\nt=13: y13=1\n\na13=U, y14=2\n\nt=14: y14=2\n\na14=U, y15=3\n\nt=15: y15=3\n\na15=U, y16=4\n\nt=16: y16=4\n\na16=U, y17=5\n\nt=17: y17=5\n\na17=U, y18=6\n\nt=18: y18=6\n\na18=U, y19=7\n\nt=19: y19=7\n\na19=U, y20=8\n\nt=20: y20=8\n\na20=U, y21=9\n\nNow, we have y_{21}=9, so H=9 actions? From t=12 to t=20, actions a12 to a20, that's 9 actions, y21=9.\n\nNow, check safety at each time t=12 to t=20.\n\nt=12: y12=0, safe.\n\nt=13: y13=1, row 1. At T=13, is row 1 safe? Earlier, row 1 unsafe only at T=14. At T=13, t'=1, safe, as we saw for row 1.\n\nt=14: y14=2, row 2. At T=14, row 2 is unsafe! Because at T=14, row 2 has collision.\n\nSimilarly, row 1,2,3,4 all unsafe at T=14.\n\ny14=2, which is row 2, and T=14, unsafe.\n\nSo collision at t=14.\n\nCannot go straight up with all U.\n\nNeed to avoid being on row 1,2,3,4 at t=14.\n\nSimilarly, later at t=16 and t=17, rows 5 and 6 are unsafe.\n\nBut in this path, at t=16, y16=4, row 4, which is safe at t=16? Row 4 unsafe only at T=14, at T=16 it is safe.\n\nIn the straight path:\n\nt=16: y16=4, row 4, at T=16, row 4 is safe, since unsafe only at T=14.\n\nt=17: y17=5, row 5, at T=17, row 5 is unsafe (since unsafe at T=16 and 17)\n\nt=18: y18=6, row 6, unsafe at T=18? Row 6 unsafe at T=16 and 17, at T=18 it is safe.\n\nIn straight path:\n\nt=16: y16=4, row 4, safe (only unsafe at T=14)\n\nt=17: y17=5, row 5, at T=17, unsafe! Problem.\n\nt=18: y18=6, row 6, at T=18, safe? Row 6 unsafe at T=16 and 17, at T=18 safe, as we saw.\n\nBut at t=17, y17=5, row 5, unsafe.\n\nSo collision at t=17 as well.\n\nSo straight up not possible.\n\nNeed to adjust.\n\nNow, the critical points are: avoid rows 1-4 at t=14, and avoid rows 5-6 at t=16 and t=17.\n\nSince rows 7 and 8 are always safe, I can be there anytime.\n\nBut I need to pass through lower rows.\n\nOne way is to delay going up or something.\n\nFor example, at t=14, I should not be on rows 1-4.\n\nSo possible actions: at some point, I stay or move down to avoid being on those rows at bad times.\n\nBut to minimize H, I should not move down unnecessarily.\n\nSince rows 1-4 are only unsafe at t=14, I can be on them at other times.\n\nSimilarly, rows 5-6 unsafe at t=16 and 17, safe at other times.\n\nSo I need to schedule when I am on each row.\n\nStart from y=0 at t=12.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nThe rows to cover: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8.\n\nEach must be visited at some time when safe.\n\nBut since I move one step at a time, I will visit them in order, but I can stay or move back, so I might visit multiple times, but for minimal H, I should visit each row only once, going up.\n\nBut with the constraints, I might need to stay or move down to wait.\n\nFor example, for rows 1-4, I can be on them before or after t=14.\n\nSimilarly for rows 5-6, before, after, or between t=16 and 17.\n\nNow, let's list safe times for each row.\n\nRow 1: safe except T=14\n\nRow 2: safe except T=14\n\nRow 3: safe except T=14\n\nRow 4: safe except T=14\n\nRow 5: safe except T=16,17\n\nRow 6: safe except T=16,17\n\nRow 7: always safe\n\nRow 8: always safe\n\nSince rows 7 and 8 always safe, no issue.\n\nNow, for rows 1-4, I need to not be on any of them at t=14.\n\nSimilarly, for rows 5-6, not at t=16 or t=17.\n\nIn the upward path, I am on row k at time t = 12 + k, if I start from y=0 at t=12, and go up each turn.\n\nBut at t=14, I would be on row 2, which is unsafe.\n\nI could start later or something.\n\nSince I can stay at y=0 or move down, but y=0 is safe.\n\nAt t=12, I am at y=0.\n\nI can choose to stay at y=0 for some turns or move up later.\n\nBut to minimize H, I should move up as soon as possible, but avoiding unsafe times.\n\nLet me consider the time when I reach each row.\n\nLet t_k be the time when I am on row k for the first time or something, but I might visit multiple times.\n\nTo save time, I should go up continuously except when I need to avoid.\n\nThe unsafe times are isolated: t=14 for rows 1-4, and t=16,17 for rows 5-6.\n\nt=14 is one time, and t=16,17 are two times.\n\nI need to be below row 1 at t=14, or above row 4, but since I start from 0, I can't be above row 4 at t=14 if I go up slowly.\n\nAt t=14, I should be at y <=0 or y>=5.\n\nBut y=0 is safe, y=5 is row 5, but row 5 at t=14 is safe, since unsafe only at t=16,17.\n\nSimilarly, row 6 at t=14 safe.\n\nSo at t=14, I can be at y=0, or y=5,6,7,8, or 9 but not reached yet.\n\nSimilarly, at t=16 and t=17, I should not be on row 5 or 6.\n\nSo at t=16, I can be below row 5 or above row 6.\n\nSimilarly for t=17.\n\nNow, let's plan the path.\n\nStart at t=12, y=0.\n\nI need to get to y=9.\n\nMinimal H=9, but not possible due to collisions.\n\nNext, H=10.\n\nThen I have one extra turn, I can use it to stay or move down and up.\n\nSimilarly for H=11, etc.\n\nBut let's try to achieve H=9 or 10.\n\nFirst, at t=14, I need to avoid rows 1-4.\n\nSo at t=14, y14 should be 0 or >=5.\n\nSince at t=13, I can be at y=0 or 1 or 2, etc.\n\nList possible positions.\n\nt=12: y=0, must take action.\n\nCase 1: at t=12, take S, stay at y=0. Then y13=0.\n\nOr take U, go to y=1.\n\nCannot take D, y= -1 not allowed, so y in [0,9], so at y=0, D not possible, only U or S.\n\nSimilarly at y=9, U not possible.\n\nBut here y=0.\n\nSo actions: U or S.\n\nSimilarly, at other points.\n\nNow, back to t=12.\n\nSuppose I take U at t=12, then y13=1.\n\nt=13: position y13=1, row 1. At T=13, row 1 is safe (only unsafe at T=14).\n\nThen I can take action at t=13.\n\nIf I take U, y14=2, but at t=14, y14=2, row 2, unsafe.\n\nNot good.\n\nIf I take S at t=13, y14=1, but at t=14, y14=1, row 1, unsafe.\n\nStill on row 1 at t=14, unsafe.\n\nIf I take D at t=13, but at y=1, I can take D, to y14=0.\n\nThen at t=14, y14=0, safe.\n\nThen I can proceed.\n\nBut I wasted a move down.\n\nThen from there, I need to go up.\n\nSimilarly, at t=12, I could take S, stay at y=0.\n\nThen y13=0.\n\nt=13: position y13=0, safe.\n\nThen I can take U to y14=1, but at t=14, y14=1, row 1, unsafe.\n\nTake S, y14=0, safe, but not progressing.\n\nTake D, not possible at y=0.\n\nSo at t=13, if y13=0, I can only U or S.\n\nIf U, to y14=1, unsafe.\n\nIf S, stay at 0.\n\nThen later.\n\nBut to avoid t=14 on rows 1-4, I need to be at y=0 or y>=5 at t=14.\n\nSince I start from y=0, to reach y>=5 at t=14, I need to go up fast.\n\nFor example, from t=12 to t=14, I have two actions: a12 and a13.\n\ny12=0\n\nAfter a12, y13\n\nAfter a13, y14\n\ny14 = 0 + Δy12 + Δy13\n\nEach Δy is -1,0,1, but since y=0, Δy12 cannot be D, so Δy12 = U or S.\n\nSimilarly, if y13=0, Δy13 cannot D.\n\nMax y14: if both U, y13=1, y14=2.\n\nMin y14: if both S, y14=0; or one S one U, y14=1; cannot be less.\n\nSo at t=14, y14 can be 0,1, or 2.\n\nBut we need y14 >=5 or 0.\n\nBut 0,1,2; 1 and 2 are in rows 1-4? y=1,2,3,4 are rows 1-4.\n\ny=1: row 1, y=2: row 2, etc.\n\ny14=0,1,2 possible.\n\ny14=0 is safe, y14=1 or 2 are unsafe since rows 1 or 2 at t=14 unsafe.\n\nSo only safe if y14=0.\n\nTherefore, at t=14, I must be at y=0 to avoid collision.\n\nIs that right?\n\ny14=0 is safe, and if y14=1 or 2, unsafe.\n\nBut y14=2 is row 2, unsafe at t=14.\n\nSimilarly, y14=1 row 1, unsafe.\n\nSo indeed, to be safe at t=14, I must have y14=0.\n\nTherefore, I need to be at y=0 at t=14.\n\nNow, how to achieve that.\n\nFrom t=12, y12=0.\n\nI need y14=0.\n\ny14 = y12 + Δy12 + Δy13\n\nSince y12=0, and y14=0, so Δy12 + Δy13 =0.\n\nPossible: both S, or U and then D, but at y=0, I cannot go down.\n\nΔy12: U or S.\n\nIf Δy12 = S, then y13=0.\n\nThen at t=13, y13=0, can take S or U.\n\nIf S, y14=0.\n\nIf U, y14=1.\n\nSimilarly, if Δy12 = U, y13=1.\n\nThen at t=13, y13=1, can take U, S, or D.\n\nIf take D, y14=0.\n\nIf take S, y14=1.\n\nIf take U, y14=2.\n\nTo have y14=0, possibilities:\n\n- a12 = S, a13 = S: then y13=0, y14=0\n\n- a12 = S, a13 = U: y13=0, y14=1 not 0\n\n- a12 = U, a13 = D: y13=1, y14=0\n\n- a12 = U, a13 = S: y13=1, y14=1 not 0\n\n- a12 = U, a13 = U: y13=1, y14=2 not 0\n\nSo only two options: (S,S) or (U,D)\n\nBoth give y14=0.\n\nIn (U,D): at t=13, I go to y=1, then down to y=0.\n\nAt t=13, when I am at y=1, is it safe? At T=13, row 1 is safe, as we saw earlier.\n\nThen at t=14, y=0, safe.\n\nSimilarly, with (S,S), I stay at y=0 both times.\n\nNow, (U,D) might be better because I make some progress? But I go up to 1 and back, so net zero, same as staying.\n\nBut in terms of position, same, but I visited row 1 at t=13.\n\nFor minimal H, since I need to go up, staying might be better or same.\n\nNow, after t=14, I am at y=0.\n\nNow, I need to go up to y=9.\n\nBut I have the issue at t=16 and t=17 with rows 5 and 6.\n\nFirst, let's set t=14, y=0.\n\nThen I can start going up.\n\nt=14: position y14=0, take action a14.\n\nI can take U or S.\n\nIf take U, go to y15=1.\n\nIf take S, stay at 0.\n\nNow, I need to consider the future unsafe times.\n\nt=16 and t=17, rows 5 and 6 unsafe.\n\nI need to not be on row 5 or 6 at t=16 or t=17.\n\nAt t=16, y16 should not be 5 or 6.\n\nSimilarly at t=17, y17 not 5 or 6.\n\nSince I am at y=0 at t=14, I can go up.\n\nThe time to reach row 5.\n\nIf I go up continuously, from t=14 y=0:\n\nt=14: y14=0, a14=U, y15=1\n\nt=15: y15=1, a15=U, y16=2\n\nt=16: y16=2, a16=U, y17=3\n\nt=17: y17=3, a17=U, y18=4\n\nt=18: y18=4, a18=U, y19=5\n\nBut at t=19, y19=5, row 5, and at T=19, is it safe? Row 5 unsafe only at T=16 and 17, so at T=19 safe.\n\nThen continue.\n\nBut I need to reach y=9.\n\nIn this path, at t=16, y16=2, row 2, which is safe since only unsafe at T=14.\n\nt=17, y17=3, row 3, safe.\n\nBut row 5 and 6 are unsafe at t=16 and 17, but I am below, so safe.\n\nThen I go to y=4 at t=18, y=5 at t=19, etc.\n\nBut at t=19, y19=5, row 5, T=19, safe.\n\nThen t=20: y20=6, row 6, T=20, safe? Row 6 unsafe at T=16,17, at T=20 safe.\n\nt=21: y21=7\n\nt=22: y22=8\n\nt=23: y23=9\n\nThen y24=9? Let's see when I reach y=9.\n\nFrom t=14 y=0:\n\nAssume all U actions:\n\na14=U, y15=1\n\na15=U, y16=2\n\na16=U, y17=3\n\na17=U, y18=4\n\na18=U, y19=5\n\na19=U, y20=6\n\na20=U, y21=7\n\na21=U, y22=8\n\na22=U, y23=9\n\nSo at t=23, y23=9.\n\nH is number of actions to reach y=9 after H actions.\n\nStart from t=12.\n\nWe have from t=12 to t=14, we have actions to set y14=0.\n\nThen from t=14 to t=23, 9 actions to go from 0 to 9.\n\nBut t=14 is included.\n\nTotal actions from t=12 to t=22? Let's list all turns.\n\nt=12: start, position y12=0, take action\n\n...\n\nup to take action at t=22, then y23=9.\n\nSo actions from t=12 to t=22, that's 11 actions? t=12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22: 11 turns.\n\nH=11.\n\nBut we might do better.\n\nEarlier at t=12 to t=14, we used two actions to be at y=0 at t=14.\n\nIn the (U,D) option, at t=12: a12=U, y13=1\n\nt=13: y13=1, a13=D, y14=0\n\nThen from t=14: y14=0, then as above.\n\nWith (S,S): a12=S, y13=0; a13=S, y14=0.\n\nThen same from there.\n\nIn both cases, from y=0 at t=14, it takes 9 actions to reach y=9 at t=23.\n\nBut H=11 actions.\n\nPerhaps I can start going up earlier to save time.\n\nBut at t=14 I must be at y=0, so I cannot be higher.\n\nUnless I can be at y>=5 at t=14, but earlier we saw that with two actions from t=12, I can only reach y=2 max at t=14, which is less than 5, so impossible to be at y>=5 at t=14.\n\nTherefore, must be at y=0 at t=14.\n\nSo for the first part, H must include some waiting.\n\nNow, after t=14, I go up, but I have rows 5 and 6 unsafe at t=16 and 17.\n\nIn the path above, from t=14 y=0, I go up slowly, so at t=16 I am at y=2, t=17 at y=3, which are below row 5, so safe, and I pass row 5 later at t=19, which is safe.\n\nBut can I go faster to reduce H?\n\nFor example, from t=14 y=0, if I go up faster, but I can only move one per turn.\n\nSuppose at t=14, I take U, y15=1\n\nThen at t=15, instead of U, I take U again, y16=2\n\nBut if I take U at t=15, y16=2, as before.\n\nI have to move one per turn.\n\nTo reach higher faster, but from y=0, it takes multiple turns.\n\nFor example, to reach row 5 at time T, I need to have moved up 5 times by then.\n\nSince y=0 at t=14, to be at row 5, I need at least 5 up moves after t=14.\n\nSo at t=14, y=0\n\nAfter 1 up: t=15, y=1\n\n2: t=16, y=2\n\n3: t=17, y=3\n\n4: t=18, y=4\n\n5: t=19, y=5\n\nSo earliest at t=19 I can be at y=5.\n\nSimilarly, at t=19, row 5 is safe, since unsafe only at 16,17.\n\nThen I can proceed to y=6 at t=20, etc.\n\nBut in this case, with the slow start, H=11 actions.\n\nBut perhaps I can avoid the delay for rows 5-6 by being above earlier.\n\nBut at t=14 I must be at 0, so I can't be higher.\n\nAnother idea: for rows 5 and 6, since they are unsafe at t=16 and 17, I can pass them before or after.\n\nIn the above, I pass them after t=19, which is fine.\n\nBut if I could pass them earlier, but I can't because I am at 0 at t=14.\n\nFor example, to be at row 5 before t=16.\n\nBut at t=14, I am at y=0, so at t=15, I can be at y=1, t=16 at y=2, cannot be at row 5 at t=16.\n\nImpossible to be at row 5 or above at t=16 from y=0 at t=14.\n\nSo I must be below row 5 at t=16 and t=17, which I am in the path.\n\nNow, but at t=17, I am at y=3, row 3, safe.\n\nThen I go to y=4 at t=18, y=5 at t=19, etc.\n\nBut when I go to y=5 at t=19, it is safe.\n\nBut row 6 at t=20, safe.\n\nBut I have another issue: at t=16 and t=17, I need to not be on row 5 or 6, which I am not, since I am at lower rows.\n\nIn this path, at t=16, y=2, row 2, safe; t=17, y=3, row 3, safe.\n\nNo problem.\n\nThen I continue to y=4 at t=18, row 4, safe.\n\ny=5 at t=19, row 5, safe (t=19>17)\n\ny=6 at t=20, row 6, safe (t=20>17)\n\ny=7 at t=21\n\ny=8 at t=22\n\ny=9 at t=23\n\nNow, with actions: from t=14 to t=22: actions a14 to a22, 9 actions to go from y=0 to y=9? y14=0, after a14 to a22, that's 9 actions, y23=9.\n\nBut we need to include from t=12.\n\nAt t=12 and t=13, we have two actions to get to y14=0.\n\nFor example, with (S,S):\n\nt=12: y12=0, a12=S, y13=0\n\nt=13: y13=0, a13=S, y14=0\n\nThen t=14: y14=0, a14=U, y15=1\n\nt=15: y15=1, a15=U, y16=2\n\nt=16: y16=2, a16=U, y17=3\n\nt=17: y17=3, a17=U, y18=4\n\nt=18: y18=4, a18=U, y19=5\n\nt=19: y19=5, a19=U, y20=6\n\nt=20: y20=6, a20=U, y21=7\n\nt=21: y21=7, a21=U, y22=8\n\nt=22: y22=8, a22=U, y23=9\n\nSo actions from t=12 to t=22, that's 11 actions: t=12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22.\n\nH=11.\n\nWith (U,D) option:\n\nt=12: y12=0, a12=U, y13=1\n\nt=13: y13=1, a13=D, y14=0\n\nThen t=14: y14=0, same as above, a14=U, ..., up to a22=U, y23=9.\n\nSame number of actions.\n\nIn this case, at t=13, I was at y=1, which is safe.\n\nBut H=11.\n\nCan I do with less?\n\nFor example, H=10 actions.\n\nThen I would reach y=9 at t=12+10=22.\n\ny22=9.\n\nBut y12=0, so sum of Δy from t=12 to t=21 must be +9.\n\nEach Δy <=1, so need at least 9 up moves, so with 10 actions, I must have 9 U and 1 S or D.\n\nBut if I have a D, net less, so must have 9 U and 1 S.\n\nNow, I need to be safe at each time.\n\nAt t=14, I must be at y=0, as we concluded.\n\nNow, from t=12 to t=14, with two actions, to have y14=0.\n\nWith two actions, if I do S and S, y14=0.\n\nOr U and D, y14=0.\n\nIn both cases, I use two actions to stay at 0.\n\nIf I could be at y=0 at t=14 with fewer actions, but I need two actions for t=12 and t=13.\n\nt=12 and t=13 are two turns.\n\nNow, with H=10 actions, from t=12 to t=21.\n\nAfter t=14, I need to go from y=0 to y=9 in 7 actions? From t=14 to t=21, actions a14 to a21, 8 actions? Let's see the indices.\n\nActions: a12, a13, a14, ..., a21 for H=10.\n\nAfter a21, y22=9.\n\nNow, y14=0.\n\nThen from y14=0 to y22=9, with actions a14 to a21, that's 8 actions.\n\nBut I need to increase y by 9, so with 8 actions, I must have at least one U extra or something.\n\ny22 = y14 + sum_{t=14 to 21} Δy_t = 0 + sum of 8 Δy.\n\nEach Δy <=1, so max y22=8, but I need y22=9, impossible with 8 actions.\n\ny14=0, after 8 actions, y22 <= 8, but I need y22=9, so impossible.\n\nTherefore, with y14=0, it takes at least 9 actions to reach y=9, from a14 to a22, y23=9.\n\nThus, with the constraint that y14=0, minimal actions after are 9, plus 2 before, total 11.\n\nBut earlier I thought H=10 impossible, yes.\n\nNow, but I have the rows 5-6 unsafe at t=16,17, but in the path I have, I am below at those times, so it's fine.\n\nBut can I avoid the need to be at y=0 at t=14?\n\nEarlier I assumed that at t=14 I must be at y=0 to avoid collision.\n\nBut is there another way?\n\nFor example, if at t=14 I am at y=5 or above, but as we saw, impossible from start.\n\nPerhaps I can be at y=0 at t=14, but then go up faster, but I can't, since one step per turn.\n\nAnother idea: for the rows 5-6, since they are unsafe at t=16 and 17, I could pass them before t=16 or after t=17.\n\nBut to pass before t=16, I need to be at row 5 or 6 before t=16.\n\nBut from t=14 at y=0, earliest at t=19 to be at row 5, which is after t=17.\n\nSo I cannot pass before; I must pass after.\n\nBut in that case, with the path above, it works with H=11.\n\nBut let's confirm the safety for rows 5-6.\n\nIn the path, I am at row 5 at t=19, which is after 17, safe.\n\nSimilarly row 6 at t=20, safe.\n\nNow, but I think I can save a turn by not staying at the beginning.\n\nFor example, instead of doing (S,S) or (U,D) at start, which both waste time, perhaps I can go up to higher rows earlier, but I can't because of t=14.\n\nUnless I stay at y=0 longer, but that would increase H.\n\nFor example, if I stay at y=0 for one more turn, then H larger.\n\nNot better.\n\nPerhaps I can go up to row 4 or something before t=14.\n\nBut at t=14, if I am on row 4, unsafe.\n\nFor example, suppose at t=12, I take U, to y13=1.\n\nThen at t=13, I take S, to y14=1, but at t=14, y14=1, unsafe.\n\nOr take U to y14=2, worse.\n\nOr take D to y14=0, which we have.\n\nBut I cannot be at y=3 or 4 at t=13, since from t=12, y12=0, with one action, y13<=1.\n\nSo impossible to be above row 4 at t=14.\n\nTherefore, the only safe position at t=14 is y=0.\n\nThus, I must have y14=0.\n\nSo minimal H is 11.\n\nBut let's see if I can reach earlier by handling the rows 5-6 differently.\n\nSuppose that after t=14, I go up faster, but I can't.\n\nPerhaps I can be at row 5 before t=16, but I can't from y=0 at t=14.\n\nAnother thought: I could go down to y=0 at some point to avoid, but not helpful.\n\nPerhaps for rows 5-6, since they are unsafe only at two times, I can stay on them before or after, but in this case, I pass after, which is fine.\n\nBut I think H=11 is the best.\n\nBut let's check if with H=11, I can have a shorter path by optimizing the actions.\n\nIn the path above, I used two S at beginning or U and D.\n\nBut in both cases, same H.\n\nNow, for the sequence, I need to output the actions.\n\nBut I also need to consider the end.\n\nIn the path, with (S,S) start:\n\nActions:\n\nt=12: S\n\nt=13: S\n\nt=14: U\n\nt=15: U\n\nt=16: U\n\nt=17: U\n\nt=18: U\n\nt=19: U\n\nt=20: U\n\nt=21: U\n\nt=22: U\n\nThen y23=9.\n\nBut at t=22, position y22=8, after action U, y23=9.\n\nNow, check safety:\n\nt=12: y=0, safe\n\nt=13: y=0, safe (since not on freeway)\n\nt=14: y=0, safe\n\nt=15: y=1, row 1, T=15, safe (only unsafe at T=14)\n\nt=16: y=2, row 2, T=16, safe (only unsafe at T=14)\n\nt=17: y=3, row 3, T=17, safe (only unsafe at T=14)\n\nt=18: y=4, row 4, T=18, safe\n\nt=19: y=5, row 5, T=19, safe (unsafe at 16,17)\n\nt=20: y=6, row 6, T=20, safe\n\nt=21: y=7, row 7, always safe\n\nt=22: y=8, row 8, always safe\n\nAll safe.\n\nWith (U,D) start:\n\nt=12: U, y13=1\n\nt=13: D, y14=0\n\nThen t=14: U, y15=1\n\n... same as above from t=15.\n\nIn this case, at t=13: y=1, row 1, T=13, safe.\n\nThen same actions from t=14.\n\nNow, but H is same.\n\nCan I reduce H by combining?\n\nFor example, if I go up immediately but avoid the rows at critical times.\n\nBut I think not.\n\nAnother idea: for rows 5 and 6, since unsafe at t=16 and 17, and I am at lower rows, but if I could be at row 7 or 8 earlier, but I start from low.\n\nSuppose at t=14 I am at y=0, and I take U at t=14, to y15=1\n\nThen at t=15, take U to y16=2\n\nBut at t=16, y16=2, safe.\n\nNow, instead of going slow, can I go faster to skip some rows? No.\n\nPerhaps I can stay at some point to delay reaching row 5 until after t=17.\n\nBut in the current path, I reach row 5 at t=19, which is fine.\n\nIf I go faster, I would reach earlier, but I can't.\n\nFor example, if from t=14 y=0, I take U at t=14, U at t=15, U at t=16, U at t=17, then y18=4? Let's see:\n\nt=14: a14=U, y15=1\n\nt=15: a15=U, y16=2\n\nt=16: a16=U, y17=3\n\nt=17: a17=U, y18=4\n\nt=18: a18=U, y19=5\n\nSame as before.\n\nI cannot reach y=5 before t=19.\n\nSo I think H=11 is minimal.\n\nBut let's confirm the answer format.\n\nThe sequence should be for turns starting from t1=12.\n\nIn the (S,S) version:\n\nTurn 12: S\n\nTurn 13: S\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nTurn 20: U\n\nTurn 21: U\n\nTurn 22: U\n\nAfter a22 at t=22, y23=9.\n\nNumber of actions: from t=12 to t=22, 11 actions.\n\nWith (U,D) at start:\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: D\n\nThen Turn 14: U\n\n...\n\nSame from 14.\n\nBut at t=13, I went to row 1, which was safe, but I used a down move, which is fine.\n\nBut in terms of sequence, both work.\n\nPerhaps I can avoid the down move.\n\nBut for output, I can choose.\n\nNow, but I think I missed something.\n\nIn the car states, for freeway 5 and 6, there are multiple cars, but we considered them, and only the third car causes issue at t=16,17.\n\nSimilarly, others are fine.\n\nIn the path above, it should be ok.\n\nBut at t=19, y=5, row 5, at T=19, safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut is there a way to reach faster?\n\nSuppose that I don't stay at the beginning, but go up to row 4 before t=14.\n\nFor example, at t=12: U, to y13=1\n\nt=13: U, to y14=2, but at t=14, y14=2, unsafe! Collision.\n\nNot possible.\n\nAt t=12: S, to y13=0\n\nt=13: U, to y14=1, unsafe at t=14.\n\nOnly by going down or staying I can be at 0.\n\nSo no.\n\nPerhaps I can be at y=9 earlier by moving up during the critical times but on safe rows.\n\nBut since rows 7-8 are safe, if I can reach them faster.\n\nBut from y=0 at t=14, it takes time.\n\nFor example, to reach y=7, I need 7 up moves, so at least t=14+7=21, y21=7, then to y=9 at t=23.\n\nSame as before.\n\nNo saving.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 11.\n\nNow for the sequence, I need to output the actions.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be like:\n\nTurn 12: a_{12}\n\nTurn 13: a_{13}\n\n...\n\nUp to Turn 12+H-1: a_{12+H-1}\n\nWith H=11, so up to Turn 22.\n\nNow, for the actions, I can use the (S,S) start or (U,D).\n\nPerhaps (S,S) is simpler, no down move.\n\nSo let's use that.\n\nBut in the beginning, with (S,S), I stay at 0 for two turns.\n\nThen go up.\n\nNow, but I need to write the sequence.\n\nBut let's list all actions.\n\nAlso, at the end, when I reach y=8 at t=22, I go to y=9.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nTurn 12: S  // stay at 0\n\nTurn 13: S  // stay at 0\n\nTurn 14: U  // to y15=1\n\nTurn 15: U  // to y16=2\n\nTurn 16: U  // to y17=3\n\nTurn 17: U  // to y18=4\n\nTurn 18: U  // to y19=5\n\nTurn 19: U  // to y20=6\n\nTurn 20: U  // to y21=7\n\nTurn 21: U  // to y22=8\n\nTurn 22: U  // to y23=9\n\nIn terms of position at time t:\n\nt=12: y=0\n\nt=13: y=0\n\nt=14: y=0\n\nt=15: y=1\n\nt=16: y=2\n\nt=17: y=3\n\nt=18: y=4\n\nt=19: y=5\n\nt=20: y=6\n\nt=21: y=7\n\nt=22: y=8\n\nAfter action at t=22, y23=9.\n\nSafety: as before, all safe.\n\nWith (U,D) start:\n\nTurn 12: U  // to y13=1\n\nTurn 13: D  // to y14=0\n\nThen same as above from turn 14.\n\nAlso fine.\n\nBut with down move, which might not be necessary, but ok.\n\nI think either is acceptable.\n\nNow, but in the output, I need to box the answer.\n\nBut let me confirm if H can be less.\n\nSuppose I go up to row 1 at t=13, then at t=14 I need to not be there, so I go down to 0, as in (U,D).\n\nThen proceed.\n\nBut same H.\n\nPerhaps I can reach row 6 later but faster overall, but no.\n\nAnother point: rows 7 and 8 are always safe, so once I reach row 7, I can go up fast.\n\nBut I reach row 7 at t=21, then to 8 and 9.\n\nIn the sequence, from t=19 to t=21, I go from 5 to 7, but I can only move one per turn.\n\nNo issue.\n\nPerhaps I can start going up earlier but avoid t=14 on low rows.\n\nBut I can't.\n\nI think 11 is minimal.\n\nBut let me check the car on row 5 and 6.\n\nFor row 5, unsafe at t=16 and 17.\n\nIn my path, I am not on row 5 at those times.\n\nSimilarly for row 6.\n\nAnd row 4 unsafe only at t=14, I am on it at t=18, safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nSo the minimal H is 11.\n\nNow for the sequence, I'll use the (S,S) start.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 12: S\n\nTurn 13: S\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nTurn 20: U\n\nTurn 21: U\n\nTurn 22: U\n\nIn the sequence, Turn 14: U, etc.\n\nTo write in the box.\n\nBut in the answer format, it should be like:\n\n\\boxed{\n\nTurn 12: S\n\nTurn 13: S\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nTurn 20: U\n\nTurn 21: U\n\nTurn 22: U\n\n}\n\nBut this is for H=11.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\nBut let me see if I can do with H=10 by not staying at start.\n\nSuppose I use only one action to be at y=0 at t=14, but I need two actions for t=12 and t=13.\n\nFor example, if at t=12 I take S, then at t=13 I must take S to have y14=0, or if I take U, y14=1, unsafe.\n\nNo choice.\n\nPerhaps at t=14 I can be at y=0 by taking only one action, but no, because at t=12 I start at y=0, and I need to control y14 with actions at t=12 and t=13.\n\nMust have two actions.\n\nSo H=11 is minimal.\n\nI think that's it.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 12\\) is 11, with the sequence of actions as follows:\n\n- At turn 12, stay (S) to remain at \\(y = 0\\), avoiding any movement that could lead to an unsafe position.\n- At turn 13, stay (S) again to ensure \\(y = 0\\) at turn 14, as rows 1–4 are unsafe at turn 14 due to car collisions.\n- From turn 14 to turn 22, move up (U) each turn to incrementally progress from \\(y = 0\\) to \\(y = 9\\):\n  - At turn 14, move up to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 15.\n  - At turn 15, move up to \\(y = 2\\) at turn 16.\n  - At turn 16, move up to \\(y = 3\\) at turn 17. At turn 16, \\(y = 2\\) is safe as row 2 is only unsafe at turn 14.\n  - At turn 17, move up to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 18. At turn 17, \\(y = 3\\) is safe as row 3 is only unsafe at turn 14.\n  - At turn 18, move up to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 19. At turn 18, \\(y = 4\\) is safe as row 4 is only unsafe at turn 14.\n  - At turn 19, move up to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 20. At turn 19, \\(y = 5\\) is safe as row 5 is only unsafe at turns 16 and 17.\n  - At turn 20, move up to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 21. At turn 20, \\(y = 6\\) is safe as row 6 is only unsafe at turns 16 and 17.\n  - At turn 21, move up to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 22. At turn 21, \\(y = 7\\) is always safe.\n  - At turn 22, move up to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 23. At turn 22, \\(y = 8\\) is always safe.\n\nThis sequence ensures that the player is never on a row with a car collision at any turn:\n- Turns 12–14: \\(y = 0\\) (safe, no freeway).\n- Turn 15: \\(y = 1\\) (row 1 safe at turn 15, unsafe only at turn 14).\n- Turn 16: \\(y = 2\\) (row 2 safe at turn 16, unsafe only at turn 14).\n- Turn 17: \\(y = 3\\) (row 3 safe at turn 17, unsafe only at turn 14).\n- Turn 18: \\(y = 4\\) (row 4 safe at turn 18, unsafe only at turn 14).\n- Turn 19: \\(y = 5\\) (row 5 safe at turn 19, unsafe only at turns 16–17).\n- Turn 20: \\(y = 6\\) (row 6 safe at turn 20, unsafe only at turns 16–17).\n- Turn 21: \\(y = 7\\) (row 7 always safe).\n- Turn 22: \\(y = 8\\) (row 8 always safe).\n\nAfter the action at turn 22, the player reaches \\(y = 9\\) at turn 23, which is safe (no freeway). \\(H = 11\\) is minimal because:\n- At turn 14, \\(y\\) must be 0 to avoid collisions on rows 1–4, requiring two actions (turns 12–13) to achieve this from \\(y = 0\\) at turn 12.\n- From \\(y = 0\\) at turn 14, at least 9 up moves are needed to reach \\(y = 9\\), taking 9 actions (turns 14–22).\n- Thus, 2 + 9 = 11 actions are necessary, and no sequence with \\(H < 11\\) can reach \\(y = 9\\) safely.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 12: S \\\\\nTurn 13: S \\\\\nTurn 14: U \\\\\nTurn 15: U \\\\\nTurn 16: U \\\\\nTurn 17: U \\\\\nTurn 18: U \\\\\nTurn 19: U \\\\\nTurn 20: U \\\\\nTurn 21: U \\\\\nTurn 22: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 13, and the player is at (0,0). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on the freeways y=1 to 8.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T only if the player is on a freeway y (from 1 to 8) and at that turn T, the car on that freeway has its span including 0 (i.e., the player's x=0 is inside the car's span at turn T).\n\nNote: When moving, the player is only on the freeway of the current y at the current turn. For example, if at turn T the player is at y and then moves to y+1 at turn T+1, then at turn T the player is only on freeway y and at turn T+1 on freeway y+1.\n\nThe car update:\n- For a left-moving car: at time T, the span is [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]? But note the given state is at t1=13.\n  Actually, the update rule is for T > t1: \n      Span(T) = [h - s*(T - t1), tau - s*(T - t1)] for left-moving? \n  But wait, the given cars are all right-moving? Actually, the direction is given: \n      For freeway 1: (-24,-47,right,24) -> so direction is right.\n\nFor a right-moving car:\n  At time t1, the car's head is at h and tail at tau? But note the representation: \n      For a right-moving car, the span at t1 is [tau, h] (because the car moves from left to right, so the head is the rightmost and tail the leftmost? But the update rule says:\n        Right-moving: Span(t1)=[tau, h] -> becomes [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut note: the example for freeway 1: (-24, -47, right, 24). \n  Here, h=-24 and tau=-47. Since it's right-moving, the head is at -24 and tail at -47? That would be a car of length 24 - (-47) = 23? Actually, the car spans from -47 to -24? Then at time T, the car will be at [ -47 + 24*(T-13), -24 + 24*(T-13) ].\n\nHowever, the collision condition is: at turn T, if the player is on freeway k (so y_T = k) and if 0 is in the span of the car on freeway k at turn T.\n\nWe must avoid being on a freeway k at turn T when any car on that freeway has 0 in its span at that turn.\n\nNote: Some freeways have multiple cars. For example, freeway 5 has three cars.\n\nOur goal: from y=0 (at turn 13) to y=9 (at some turn T). We can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S). We cannot go below 0 or above 9.\n\nWe are starting at y=0 at turn 13. We cannot go below 0. We want to get to y=9.\n\nWe must avoid the freeways y=1 to y=8 at the exact turn when a car on that freeway covers x=0.\n\nWe are allowed to be on y=0 and y=9 at any time without worrying about cars (since cars are only on y=1..8).\n\nStrategy: We need to move upward. But we must avoid the cars on the freeways at the times we are on them.\n\nWe are going to simulate the car positions at future turns. Since we are starting at turn 13, and we are going to compute for turns t = 13, 14, 15, ... until we reach y=9.\n\nWe must compute for each freeway and each car, the times when the car covers x=0.\n\nBut note: the cars move continuously? Actually, they move discretely: at each turn, they move s units? But the update is linear: at turn T (relative to t1=13), the car has moved s*(T-13).\n\nSo for a right-moving car on freeway k with initial (h, tau, d, s) at t1=13, at turn T (>=13) the car spans [tau + s*(T-13), h + s*(T-13)].\n\nWe need 0 to be in [tau + s*(T-13), h + s*(T-13)]? But note: for a right-moving car, the head is greater than the tail? In the example: freeway1: h=-24, tau=-47 -> so tau < h. Therefore, the interval is [tau + s*(T-13), h + s*(T-13)].\n\nSimilarly, for a left-moving car we would have the opposite, but all cars in this problem are right-moving.\n\nSo for each car, we can compute the time interval (if any) during which 0 is inside the car's span.\n\nWe need to avoid being on that freeway at that exact turn.\n\nLet me compute for each freeway the set of turns T (>=13) at which the freeway is unsafe (i.e., at least one car on that freeway has 0 in its span).\n\nBut note: multiple cars on the same freeway? Yes, freeway 5 and 6 have three cars.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (-24, -47, right, 24)\n  Span at T: [ -47 + 24*(T-13), -24 + 24*(T-13) ]\n  We require: -47 + 24*(T-13) <= 0 <= -24 + 24*(T-13)\n  Solve:\n    Lower bound: -47 + 24*(T-13) <= 0  => 24*(T-13) <= 47 => T-13 <= 47/24 = 1.958 => T <= 14.958 -> T<=14 (since T integer) for the lower bound condition? Actually, we need the entire interval.\n\n  Actually, we need:\n    -47 + 24*(T-13) <= 0   and  0 <= -24 + 24*(T-13)\n\n  Let me solve the two inequalities:\n\n  Inequality 1: -47 + 24*(T-13) <= 0\n      => 24*(T-13) <= 47\n      => T-13 <= 47/24 = 1.9583\n      => T <= 13 + 1.9583 = 14.9583 -> so T <= 14 (if we take integer T)\n\n  Inequality 2: 0 <= -24 + 24*(T-13)\n      => 24 <= 24*(T-13)\n      => 1 <= T-13\n      => T >= 14\n\n  So both together: T>=14 and T<=14 -> so T=14.\n\n  Therefore, freeway 1 is unsafe at T=14.\n\nFreeway 2: (-12, -47, right, 36)\n  Span: [ -47 + 36*(T-13), -12 + 36*(T-13) ]\n\n  Conditions:\n    -47 + 36*(T-13) <= 0   => 36*(T-13) <= 47 => T-13 <= 47/36 ≈ 1.305 => T <= 14.305 -> T<=14\n    and\n    0 <= -12 + 36*(T-13) => 12 <= 36*(T-13) => T-13 >= 12/36 = 1/3 => T>=13.33 -> so T>=14 (since T integer)\n\n  So T=14.\n\nFreeway 3: same as freeway2: (-12,-47,right,36) -> so also T=14.\n\nFreeway 4: same -> T=14.\n\nFreeway 5: three cars: \n  Car1: (54,43,right,6) -> wait, head=54, tail=43? Then the car is from 43 to 54?

So this car never covers 0.\n\n  Car2: (18,7,right,6) -> [7+6*(T-13), 18+6*(T-13)]\n        Conditions: 7+6*(T-13)<=0 and 0<=18+6*(T-13)\n        The second condition: 0<=18+6*(T-13) -> 6*(T-13)>=-18 -> T-13>=-3 -> T>=10 -> always true for T>=13.\n        First condition: 7+6*(T-13)<=0 -> 6*(T-13)<=-7 -> T-13<=-7/6≈-1.16 -> T<=11.84 -> so for T>=13, this condition is never true.\n\n        So actually, we require 0 in [7+6*(T-13), 18+6*(T-13)] -> which is positive numbers? At T=13: [7,18] -> positive. At T=12: [1,12] -> still positive. So never covers 0? \n\n        But wait: at T=13: the car is at [7,18] -> which is positive? Then 0 is not in [7,18]. So indeed, this car never covers 0.\n\n  Car3: (-18,-29,right,6) -> [-29+6*(T-13), -18+6*(T-13)]\n        Conditions: \n          -29+6*(T-13) <= 0 <= -18+6*(T-13)\n          First: -29+6*(T-13)<=0 -> 6*(T-13)<=29 -> T-13<=29/6≈4.833 -> T<=17.833 -> T<=17\n          Second: 0<=-18+6*(T-13) -> 18<=6*(T-13) -> T-13>=3 -> T>=16\n          So T in [16,17] (integer: T=16,17)\n\n  Therefore, freeway5 is unsafe at T=16 and T=17.\n\nFreeway6: same as freeway5? \n  It has the same three cars: (54,43,right,6), (18,7,right,6), (-18,-29,right,6). \n  So same: unsafe at T=16,17.\n\nFreeway7: (60,49,right,12) -> [49+12*(T-13), 60+12*(T-13)]\n  Conditions: \n      49+12*(T-13)<=0 -> 12*(T-13)<=-49 -> T-13<=-49/12≈-4.08 -> impossible.\n  So never unsafe.\n\nFreeway8: (52,41,right,4) -> [41+4*(T-13), 52+4*(T-13)]\n  Conditions: \n      41+4*(T-13)<=0 -> 4*(T-13)<=-41 -> T-13<=-10.25 -> impossible.\n  So never unsafe.\n\nSummary of unsafe freeways and turns:\n\nFreeway 1: unsafe at T=14\nFreeway 2: unsafe at T=14\nFreeway 3: unsafe at T=14\nFreeway 4: unsafe at T=14\nFreeway 5: unsafe at T=16,17\nFreeway 6: unsafe at T=16,17\nFreeway 7: safe at all turns\nFreeway 8: safe at all turns\n\nWe start at turn 13 at y=0. We want to get to y=9.\n\nWe can only move one step per turn (or stay). So we need at least 9 moves (if we go up every turn). But we have to avoid the unsafe states.\n\nWe are at:\n  Turn 13: y=0\n\nWe must avoid:\n  On freeway 1,2,3,4 at turn 14 -> so if we are on y=1,2,3,4 at turn 14, we crash.\n\nAlso, avoid freeway 5 and 6 at turns 16 and 17.\n\nWe want the minimal number of turns. The minimal number of moves is 9 (if we go up 9 times). But can we do it in 9 turns? Let's see:\n\nWe start at turn13: y0=0.\n\nTurn13: we are at y=0 (safe, because cars are on freeways 1..8 and we are at 0).\n\nTurn14: we choose an action at turn13 to move to y1. We can go to y=1 (if we choose U) or stay at 0 (S) or even go down? but we are at 0, so D would stay at 0.\n\nBut if we go to y=1 at turn14, then we are on freeway1 at turn14 -> which is unsafe. Similarly, if we go to y=2,3,4 at turn14, they are unsafe.\n\nSo we must avoid being on freeway1,2,3,4 at turn14.\n\nTherefore, at turn14 we cannot be on y=1,2,3,4. We can be on y=0, or y=5,6,7,8? But wait, we start at y=0 at turn13. How can we be at y=5 at turn14? We can only move one step per turn. So at turn14, the possible y values are 0 (if we did S or D) or 1 (if we did U). We cannot get to y=5 in one move.\n\nTherefore, the only safe option at turn14 is to be at y=0 (by doing S or D at turn13). So we must do S at turn13? Then at turn14 we are at y=0.\n\nNow at turn14: we are at y=0. Then we can choose to move. But we have to avoid the unsafe turns for freeways 5 and 6 at turns 16 and 17.\n\nWe want to get to y=9. We have to go through the freeways.\n\nLet me plan:\n\nWe are at:\n  T=13: y=0\n  T=14: y=0 (by doing S at T=13)\n\nNow at T=14, we can do an action. We can go to y=1 at T=15? But note: at T=15, we would be on freeway1? But freeway1 is only unsafe at T=14. So at T=15, freeway1 is safe? Yes.\n\nSimilarly, freeway2,3,4 are unsafe only at T=14. So at T=15, they are safe.\n\nBut we also have to avoid freeway5 and 6 at T=16 and T=17.\n\nSo if we go up at T=14, then at T=15 we are at y=1. Then at T=15 we can go up to y=2 at T=16. But at T=16, if we are on freeway2? Actually, freeway2 is the freeway at y=2. And at T=16, freeway2 is safe? (because unsafe only at T=14). But freeway5 is unsafe at T=16 and T=17? But we are at y=2 at T=16, which is freeway2, not freeway5 (which is y=5). So safe.\n\nBut we must eventually pass freeway5? Yes, to get to y=9 we must go through y=5 and y=6.\n\nWe must avoid being on y=5 at T=16 or T=17, and avoid being on y=6 at T=16 or T=17.\n\nSo we can be on y=5 at any turn except 16 and 17, and similarly for y=6.\n\nWe are at T=14: y=0.\n\nWe need to get to y=9. The minimal moves is 9 moves, but we have already spent one turn (T=13) without moving up. So we are at T=14 at y=0. We need 9 more moves to get to y=9? Actually, from y=0 to y=9 we need 9 moves. So the earliest we can be at y=9 is T=14+9 = 23.\n\nBut we can do:\n\n  T=14: at y=0 -> we can do U to y=1 at T=15.\n  T=15: at y=1 -> U to y=2 at T=16.\n  T=16: at y=2 -> U to y=3 at T=17.\n  T=17: at y=3 -> U to y=4 at T=18.\n  T=18: at y=4 -> U to y=5 at T=19.\n\nBut at T=19, we are on y=5. Is y=5 safe at T=19? Yes, because freeway5 is unsafe only at 16 and 17. So safe.\n\nThen:\n  T=19: at y=5 -> U to y=6 at T=20 -> but freeway6 is unsafe at T=16,17? So at T=20, safe.\n  T=20: at y=6 -> U to y=7 at T=21 -> safe (freeway7 is always safe)\n  T=21: at y=7 -> U to y=8 at T=22 -> safe (freeway8 is always safe)\n  T=22: at y=8 -> U to y=9 at T=23.\n\nSo we arrive at y=9 at T=23. That would be 10 moves? Actually, from T=14 to T=23 we have 9 moves (from y0 to y9 in 9 steps). And we started at T=13 at y=0 and did nothing at T=13.\n\nTotal turns: from T=13 to T=23: 11 turns? But we count the actions: we take actions at T=13,14,...,22 (10 actions) and at T=23 we are at y=9? Actually, we are at y=9 at the beginning of turn T=23? Or after the action?\n\nThe update: at turn t, we take action a_t, then we are at the new position at the next turn? \n\nThe problem says: \n  y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, where Δy_t depends on a_t.\n\nSo at the end of turn t (after action a_t) we are at position for turn t+1.\n\nBut the collision condition: at turn T, we are at y_T. And we are concerned with the car positions at turn T.\n\nSo at turn T, we are at y_T (which we got from the previous action at T-1).\n\nTherefore, we start at turn 13: y_13 = 0 (given).\n\nThen:\n  At turn 13: we take action a_13 -> then we get y_14 = y_13 + Δy_13.\n  At turn 14: we are at y_14, and we take a_14 -> then we get y_15, and so on.\n\nWe want to reach y_{t} = 9 for some t. The minimal t is 13 + 9 = 22? Because we need 9 moves up. But note: at turn 13 we are at y=0. Then at turn 14 we could be at y=1 (if we moved up at 13), and then at turn22 we would be at y=9.\n\nBut we had a problem at turn14: if we had moved up at turn13, then at turn14 we are at y=1 -> which is unsafe.\n\nSo we did not move at turn13: a_13 = S, then at turn14 we are at y=0.\n\nThen we move up at turn14: a_14=U -> at turn15 we are at y=1.\n\nThen we move up at turn15: a_15=U -> at turn16 we are at y=2.\n\nAt turn16: we are at y=2 -> safe (freeway2 unsafe only at T=14).\n\nThen a_16=U -> at turn17 we are at y=3 -> safe (freeway3 unsafe only at T=14).\n\nThen a_17=U -> at turn18 we are at y=4 -> safe (freeway4 unsafe only at T=14).\n\nThen a_18=U -> at turn19 we are at y=5 -> freeway5: unsafe at T=16,17 -> but T=19 is safe.\n\nThen a_19=U -> at turn20 we are at y=6 -> freeway6: unsafe at T=16,17 -> T=20 safe.\n\nThen a_20=U -> at turn21 we are at y=7 -> safe.\n\na_21=U -> at turn22 we are at y=8 -> safe.\n\na_22=U -> at turn23 we are at y=9 -> done.\n\nSo we reached y=9 at turn23. The actions are from turn13 to turn22 (inclusive) -> 10 actions.\n\nBut note: we are to provide the sequence for turns starting at t1=13. We have:\n\n  Turn13: S\n  Turn14: U\n  Turn15: U\n  Turn16: U\n  Turn17: U\n  Turn18: U\n  Turn19: U\n  Turn20: U\n  Turn21: U\n  Turn22: U\n\nTotal 10 turns? But H is the minimal number of turns? We used 10 actions (from t13 to t22) and we are at y9 at turn23. However, the problem says: we are to provide the sequence of actions for t = t1, t1+1, ... until the last action at t1+H-1, and then at the next turn (t1+H) we are at (0,9).\n\nSo H is the number of actions? And we have H=10.\n\nBut can we do it in fewer?\n\nWe spent one extra turn at the beginning. Is there a way to avoid that?\n\nAlternative: what if we don't stay at turn13? We cannot go down. So we must stay at y=0 at turn14? Or is there another option?\n\nWhat if we move up at turn13? Then at turn14 we are at y=1 -> which is unsafe (because freeway1 at turn14 is unsafe). So we crash. Not allowed.\n\nSo we must stay at turn13.\n\nBut what if we move up at turn13 and then move down at turn14? Then at turn14 we would be at y=0? But wait: at turn13: we are at y0=0. Then we do U: so at turn14 we are at y1=1. Then at turn14 we do D: then at turn15 we are at y2=0. So we are back to y=0 at turn15. Then we start moving up from turn15. Then we would be at:\n\n  T15: y=0\n  T16: y=1 (if we do U at T15) -> but at T16, freeway1 is safe? (because unsafe only at T14) -> so safe.\n  Then we can move up normally.\n\nBut then we are at:\n  T15: y=0\n  T16: y=1\n  T17: y=2 -> safe (freeway2 unsafe only at T14)\n  T18: y=3 -> safe\n  T19: y=4 -> safe\n  T20: y=5 -> but freeway5 unsafe at T16,17 -> safe at T20? \n  T21: y=6 -> safe (freeway6 unsafe at T16,17 -> safe at T21)\n  T22: y=7\n  T23: y=8\n  T24: y=9\n\nSo we get to y=9 at T24 -> that's even later (11 actions: from T13 to T23).\n\nSo worse.\n\nWhat if we try to go faster? We cannot skip steps.\n\nAnother idea: avoid freeway5 and 6 at the unsafe times by waiting? But we are already behind.\n\nBut note: we have to be at y=5 and y=6 at safe times. The unsafe times are T=16,17. So we can be at y=5 at T<16 or T>=18? Similarly for y=6.\n\nIn our first plan, we were at y=5 at T=19 and y=6 at T=20, which is safe.\n\nBut can we get to y=5 earlier? For example, if we start moving up earlier? But we were blocked at T14.\n\nWe started moving at T14: so we get to y=5 at T19. That is 5 moves from T14 to T19? Actually:\n\n  T14: y0=0 -> we do U at T14 -> T15: y=1\n        T15: U -> T16: y=2\n        T16: U -> T17: y=3\n        T17: U -> T18: y=4\n        T18: U -> T19: y=5\n\nSo 5 moves from T14 to T19. Then we need 4 more to get to y=9: T23.\n\nTotal actions: 10 (from T13 to T22).\n\nBut is there a way to get to y=9 in 9 actions? That would be at turn13+9 = turn22.\n\nTo be at y=9 at turn22, we must have taken 9 up moves. That would require:\n\n  T13: U -> T14: y=1 -> unsafe (T14, freeway1) -> crash.\n\nSo impossible in 9 actions.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 10.\n\nBut wait: what if we go up faster by not moving in a straight line? For example, can we go up two freeways and then wait? \n\nBut we can only move one step per turn. So we cannot jump over freeways. We must go through each freeway in order.\n\nThe only way to avoid the crash at T14 on freeways 1-4 is to not be on those freeways at T14. Since we start at y=0 at T13, we cannot be above y=1 at T14. So we must be at y=0 at T14.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 10.\n\nBut let me check if we can avoid the freeway5 and 6 at T16,17 without waiting? Actually, we are not on freeway5 and 6 until later, so we are safe.\n\nBut note: we are at y=2 at T16 -> safe. Then we move to y=3 at T17 -> safe. So no problem.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is:\n\n  Turn13: S (to stay at y=0 at T14, avoiding crash)\n  Turn14: U -> T15: y=1\n  Turn15: U -> T16: y=2\n  Turn16: U -> T17: y=3\n  Turn17: U -> T18: y=4\n  Turn18: U -> T19: y=5\n  Turn19: U -> T20: y=6\n  Turn20: U -> T21: y=7\n  Turn21: U -> T22: y=8\n  Turn22: U -> T23: y=9\n\nWe are done at T23. The last action is at turn22. So we have 10 actions.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and we have H=10.\n\nBut wait: the problem says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning from t1 (which is 13) to t1+H-1 (which is 13+9=22). So H=10.\n\nSo the answer:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 13: S\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: U\nTurn 16: U\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\nTurn 19: U\nTurn 20: U\nTurn 21: U\nTurn 22: U\n}\n\nBut wait: we have 10 lines? From turn13 to turn22, that's 10 turns.\n\nHowever, let me double-check the unsafe conditions:\n\nAt T14: we are at y=0 -> safe.\n\nAt T15: y=1 -> freeway1: unsafe only at T14 -> safe.\n\nAt T16: y=2 -> freeway2: unsafe only at T14 -> safe.\n\nAt T17: y=3 -> freeway3: unsafe only at T14 -> safe.\n\nAt T18: y=4 -> freeway4: unsafe only at T14 -> safe.\n\nAt T19: y=5 -> freeway5: unsafe at T16,17 -> safe at T19.\n\nAt T20: y=6 -> freeway6: unsafe at T16,17 -> safe at T20.\n\nAt T21: y=7 -> safe.\n\nAt T22: y=8 -> safe.\n\nAt T23: y=9 -> safe and goal.\n\nSo it works.\n\nBut is there a way to do it in 9 actions? We argued no, because if we start moving at T13, we crash at T14.\n\nWhat if we move up at T13 and then at T14 we move up again? Then at T14 we are at y=1 -> crash.\n\nWhat if we move up at T13 and then at T14 we move down? Then at T14 we are at y=0 -> but wait: from y=1 (at T14) we move down: then at T15 we are at y=0. Then we are at T15 at y=0. Then we start moving up. Then we get to y=9 at T24 -> which is 11 actions. Worse.\n\nSo minimal is 10.\n\nBut note: we are at T13: y=0. We have to take an action. We took S. What if we take D? Then we are still at y=0 at T14 (since we cannot go below 0). Same as S.\n\nSo S or D are equivalent. We can write S.\n\nTherefore, the answer is as above.\n\nBut the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\". We have H=10.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H\", and then provide the sequence. We have provided the sequence for 10 turns.\n\nBut let me see if we can skip one turn later? For example, can we avoid the freeway5 and 6 by going faster? But we are moving as fast as possible: we are moving up every turn from T14 to T22.\n\nSo no.\n\nAnother idea: what if we wait at y=0 for more than one turn? That would only delay.\n\nOr wait at some other safe freeway? But we want minimal time.\n\nSo we start moving as soon as possible (at T14) and then move up continuously.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 13: S\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: U\nTurn 16: U\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\nTurn 19: U\nTurn 20: U\nTurn 21: U\nTurn 22: U\n}\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" and so on. So we write:\n\nTurn 13: S\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: U\nTurn 16: U\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\nTurn 19: U\nTurn 20: U\nTurn 21: U\nTurn 22: U\n\nWe have 10 lines.\n\nBut wait: the problem says \"sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\". So for t from 0 to 9 (if H=10) we have t=0,...,9 -> 10 actions. So that's correct.\n\nWe are done.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 13\\) is 10.

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at (0, 0) on turn t_1 = 14, and needs to get to (0, 9) in the fewest turns possible, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. The vertical position y ranges from 0 to 9.\n\nThe player can move up (U, y increases by 1), down (D, y decreases by 1), or stay (S, y stays the same), but y must stay within [0,9], so no moving below 0 or above 9.\n\nCollision happens only if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T where there's a car that has 0 in its span at that exact turn. The span is the segment covered by the car, and for left-moving cars, it's [h, τ] with h decreasing, and for right-moving, it's [τ, h] with h increasing. In the car state, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nLooking at the car state:\n\n- Freeway 1: (0, -23, right, 24) — so head=0, tail=-23, direction right, speed 24. Since it's right-moving, the span at turn t_1=14 is [τ, h] = [-23, 0]. But head and tail: for right-moving, head is the front, so when moving right, head increases. Similarly for left-moving, head decreases.\n\nIn the update rule:\n\n- Left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\n- Right-moving: Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nSo for right-moving, at time t_1, span is [tail, head], and it moves right, so both increase with time.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, span is [head, tail] and both decrease.\n\nIn the table, for each car, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nSo for freeway 1: (head=0, tail=-23, direction=right, speed=24)\n\nSince direction is right, at t_1=14, the span is [tail, head] = [-23, 0]\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 2: (head=24, tail=-11, right, 36) → span [ -11, 24 ]\n\nFreeway 3: same as freeway 2, (24, -11, right, 36) → [ -11, 24 ]\n\nFreeway 4: same, (24, -11, right, 36) → [ -11, 24 ]\n\nFreeway 5: multiple cars? It says: (60,49,right,6), (24,13,right,6), (-12,-23,right,6) so three cars on freeway 5, all right-moving.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 6: same three cars as freeway 5: (60,49,right,6), (24,13,right,6), (-12,-23,right,6)\n\nFreeway 7: (-48,-59,right,12) → head=-48, tail=-59, direction right, so since right, span is [tail, head] = [-59, -48]\n\nFreeway 8: (56,45,right,4) → [45,56]\n\nNow, the player starts at y=0 on turn t_1=14. y=0 is not a freeway; freeways are y=1 to y=8, so at y=0, there are no cars, so it's safe. Similarly, y=9 should be safe, as it's the goal.\n\nThe player needs to reach y=9.\n\nCollision only when on a freeway y=1 to 8 at turn T, and for that freeway, there is a car such that 0 is in its span at turn T.\n\n\"0\" here refers to the x-coordinate, I assume, since the player is at (0, y), so x=0.\n\nThe grid is 2D, but player only moves vertically, horizontally always at x=0. Cars are on horizontal freeways at different y levels, moving left or right.\n\nSo collision if at turn T, player is at (0, y_T) with y_T between 1 and 8, and for freeway y_T, there is a car whose span includes x=0 at that turn T.\n\nNow, I need to find a sequence of actions to go from y=0 to y=9 in min turns, avoiding being on a freeway when a car is at x=0.\n\nSince moving between freeways, the position change happens at the end of the turn, I think.\n\nFrom the player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, based on action at t.\n\nAnd collision is checked at turn T, based on position y_T.\n\nAlso, note that when you move to a new y, you are not on that new y until the next turn. Let me read the note.\n\n\"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nSo at turn T, you are on y_T. After action at T, you move to y_{T+1}, but for collision at turn T, you are on y_T, so only cars on y_T matter.\n\nSimilarly, at turn T+1, you are on y_{T+1}, so cars on y_{T+1} matter.\n\nSo when you take an action at T, it affects position at T+1.\n\nStart: turn t_1 = 14, position (0,0)\n\nAfter action a_{14}, position at turn 15: y_{15} = y_{14} + Δy_{14}\n\nBut collision is checked at each turn based on current position.\n\nAt turn 14, position is (0,0), which is not a freeway, so no collision possible.\n\nThen after action, at turn 15, position is (0, y_{15}), and if y_{15} between 1 and 8, we check if cars on that freeway have 0 in span at turn 15.\n\nSimilarly for subsequent turns.\n\nWe need to reach y=9, which is safe.\n\ny=9 is not a freeway, so no cars, safe.\n\nThe goal is to be at (0,9) at some turn, say turn T, meaning after actions up to T-1, we are at y_T = 9.\n\nIn the sequence, we need actions from a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H - 1} such that after H actions, we are at y_{t_1 + H} = 9? Let's see the indexing.\n\nThe player starts at turn t_1 with position given.\n\nAfter action a_{t_1}, at turn t_1 + 1, position is updated.\n\nThen after a_{t_1 + 1}, at turn t_1 + 2, position updated, and so on.\n\nAfter H actions, we are at turn t_1 + H.\n\nWe want position at turn t_1 + H to be (0,9).\n\nThe sequence of actions is from t_1 to t_1 + H - 1, so H actions, reaching at turn t_1 + H.\n\nMinimize H.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be actions starting from turn t_1.\n\nNow, to minimize H, we probably want to move up as much as possible, but we have to avoid the freeways when cars are at x=0.\n\nEach action U increases y by 1, D decreases, S stays.\n\ny from 0 to 9, so minimum H should be 9, if we can always move up without colliding.\n\nBut we need to check for each freeway y=1 to y=8, at what turns the car spans include x=0.\n\nSince we start at turn 14, and we can control when we arrive at each y.\n\nLet me denote the turn number relative to t_1.\n\nSet t = 0 as turn t_1 = 14.\n\nSo at time τ = 0 (turn 14), position y=0.\n\nAfter action at τ=0, position at τ=1 (turn 15), and so on.\n\nWe want position at some time τ = H to be y_H = 9.\n\nActions from τ=0 to τ=H-1.\n\nH is the number of turns from start to reach, including start? No.\n\nAt time τ=0, turn t_1, position is given.\n\nAfter action at τ=0, at time τ=1, position updated.\n\nSo to be at y=9 at time τ, it means after actions at τ-1, we have moved to y=9.\n\nFor y to be 9 at time τ, we must have taken actions such that we arrive at τ.\n\nThe first possible time to be at y=9 is if we move up every turn, starting from y=0 at τ=0.\n\nAfter one U, at τ=1, y=1\n\nAfter two U, at τ=2, y=2\n\n...\n\nAfter nine U, at τ=9, y=9.\n\nSo in 9 actions, we can go from 0 to 9, arriving at each y at time τ.\n\nBut we need to avoid collision at each freeway when we are there.\n\nAt time τ, if y_τ between 1 and 8, it must be that no car on that freeway has 0 in span at time τ.\n\nTime τ corresponds to turn t_1 + τ.\n\nSince t_1=14, turn number T = 14 + τ.\n\nFor each freeway k, and for each car on it, we need to find when 0 is in the span at time T.\n\nThat is, for turn T, with T = 14 + τ.\n\nThe span at time T for a car depends on its state at t_1 and the time difference.\n\nFrom the update rule.\n\nFirst, for each freeway, list the cars and their span at time T.\n\nStart with freeway 1: one car, (head=0, tail=-23, direction=right, speed=24) at t_1=14.\n\nRight-moving, so span at time T: [τ + s(T - t_1), h + s(T - t_1)] but since right, span is [tail + s(T - t_1), head + s(T - t_1)]\n\nAt t_1, span [tail, head] = [-23, 0]\n\nAt time T, span [tail + s(T - t_1), head + s(T - t_1)] = [-23 + 24(T - 14), 0 + 24(T - 14)] = [-23 + 24ΔT, 24ΔT] where ΔT = T - 14.\n\n0 is in span if -23 + 24ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ 24ΔT\n\nSince 24ΔT ≥ 0 for ΔT ≥ 0, and -23 + 24ΔT ≤ 0 when 24ΔT ≤ 23, so ΔT ≤ 23/24 < 1.\n\nSince ΔT integer, for ΔT = 0, at T=14, span [-23,0], so 0 is included.\n\nAt T=14, ΔT=0, span [-23,0], x=0 is the head, so yes, included.\n\nFor ΔT=1, T=15, span [-23+24, 0+24] = [1,24], 0 not in [1,24], so not included.\n\nSimilarly for higher ΔT, span moves right, so 0 not in span.\n\nSo for freeway 1, at turn T=14, 0 is in span, but at T=14, player is at y=0, not on freeway 1, so no collision issue when arriving.\n\nBut when player is on freeway 1, which is y=1, at some time τ, y_τ=1, which corresponds to turn T=14 + τ.\n\nCollision if 0 in span at that T.\n\nFor freeway 1, 0 in span only at T=14, when span is [-23,0].\n\nFor T>14, span [1,24] at T=15, [25,48] at T=16, etc., all >0, so 0 not in span.\n\nSo for freeway 1, it is only dangerous at turn T=14, but at T=14, player is at y=0, not on y=1. So when player is on y=1, at any turn T>14, it is safe, since no car at x=0.\n\nPlayer can be on y=1 at turn T=15 or later, which is safe.\n\nNow freeway 2: (head=24, tail=-11, right, 36) at t_1=14.\n\nSpan at t_1: [tail, head] = [-11, 24]\n\nAt time T: [ -11 + 36ΔT, 24 + 36ΔT ] where ΔT = T - 14\n\n0 in span if -11 + 36ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ 24 + 36ΔT\n\n0 ≤ 24 + 36ΔT always true for ΔT ≥ 0\n\n-11 + 36ΔT ≤ 0 ⇒ 36ΔT ≤ 11 ⇒ ΔT ≤ 11/36 < 1, so only for ΔT=0, T=14\n\nAt T=14, span [-11,24], 0 is in it.\n\nFor T>14, ΔT≥1, -11+36 ≥25>0, so min x is at least 25, 0 not in span.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as freeway 2, (24,-11,right,36) so same, dangerous only at T=14.\n\nFreeway 4: same, dangerous only at T=14.\n\nNow freeway 5: three cars.\n\nFirst car: (head=60, tail=49, right, 6) at t_1=14.\n\nHead=60, tail=49? For right-moving, head should be greater than tail? 60>49, yes.\n\nSpan at t_1: [tail, head] = [49,60]\n\nAt time T: [49 + 6ΔT, 60 + 6ΔT]\n\nMin x = 49 + 6ΔT ≥ 49 >0 for all ΔT, so 0 never in span. Always safe for this car.\n\nSecond car: (head=24, tail=13, right, 6) at t_1=14.\n\nSpan [13,24]\n\nAt T: [13 + 6ΔT, 24 + 6ΔT] ≥13>0, so 0 never in span. Safe.\n\nThird car: (head=-12, tail=-23, right, 6) at t_1=14.\n\nHead=-12, tail=-23, so head > tail, since -12 > -23.\n\nSpan [tail, head] = [-23, -12]\n\nAt time T: [ -23 + 6ΔT, -12 + 6ΔT ]\n\n0 in span if -23 + 6ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ -12 + 6ΔT\n\nFirst inequality: -23 + 6ΔT ≤ 0 ⇒ 6ΔT ≤ 23 ⇒ ΔT ≤ 23/6 ≈ 3.833, so ΔT ≤ 3\n\nSecond inequality: 0 ≤ -12 + 6ΔT ⇒ 6ΔT ≥ 12 ⇒ ΔT ≥ 2\n\nSo for ΔT=2,3\n\nΔT=2: T=16, span [-23+12, -12+12] = [-11, 0]\n\n0 ≤ 0 ≤ 0? 0 is equal to upper bound, so included? Span is [lower, upper], inclusive I assume.\n\nIn the inequality, it says ≤ and ≥, so yes, inclusive.\n\nAt ΔT=2, T=16, span [-11, 0], so x=0 is included (tail end).\n\nAt ΔT=3, T=17, span [-23+18, -12+18] = [-5, 6], so 0 in [-5,6], yes.\n\nAt ΔT=4, T=18, span [-23+24, -12+24] = [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo for freeway 5, third car, 0 in span at T=16 and T=17.\n\nNow, the other cars on freeway 5 are always safe, so overall, freeway 5 has collision at T=16 and T=17.\n\nT=16 and T=17.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6: same cars as freeway 5, so also collision at T=16 and T=17.\n\nNow freeway 7: (head=-48, tail=-59, right, 12)\n\nDirection right, head=-48, tail=-59, so span [tail, head] = [-59, -48]\n\nAt time T: [ -59 + 12ΔT, -48 + 12ΔT ]\n\n0 in span if -59 + 12ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ -48 + 12ΔT\n\nFirst: -59 + 12ΔT ≤ 0 ⇒ 12ΔT ≤ 59 ⇒ ΔT ≤ 59/12 ≈ 4.916, so ΔT ≤ 4\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -48 + 12ΔT ⇒ 12ΔT ≥ 48 ⇒ ΔT ≥ 4\n\nSo only ΔT=4, T=18\n\nAt T=18, span [-59+48, -48+48] = [-11, 0], so 0 included.\n\nAt other times, not.\n\nSo freeway 7 collision at T=18.\n\nFinally, freeway 8: (head=56, tail=45, right, 4)\n\nSpan [45,56] at t_1, min 45>0, so never 0 in span. Always safe.\n\nSummary of dangerous times for each freeway:\n\n- Freeway 1: dangerous only at T=14\n\n- Freeway 2: dangerous only at T=14\n\n- Freeway 3: dangerous only at T=14\n\n- Freeway 4: dangerous only at T=14\n\n- Freeway 5: dangerous at T=16 and T=17\n\n- Freeway 6: dangerous at T=16 and T=17\n\n- Freeway 7: dangerous at T=18\n\n- Freeway 8: always safe\n\nSince player is not on freeways at T=14 (y=0), we don't care about T=14 for being on freeways.\n\nNow, player needs to go from y=0 to y=9.\n\nEach move up increases y by 1.\n\nTo minimize time, we want to move up as fast as possible, but avoid being on a freeway when it is dangerous.\n\nThe dangerous freeways are:\n\n- y=5 and y=6 at T=16 and T=17\n\n- y=7 at T=18\n\ny=1 to y=4 are always safe after T=14, since only dangerous at T=14, which is past.\n\ny=8 always safe.\n\ny=5 dangerous at T=16,17\n\ny=6 dangerous at T=16,17\n\ny=7 dangerous at T=18\n\ny=4, y=8 safe always.\n\nNow, time starts at T=14, which is τ=0.\n\nPosition at time τ: y_τ\n\nWe start at τ=0, y=0\n\nAfter action, at τ=1, y could be 0 or 1, etc.\n\nWe want y_H = 9 for some H.\n\nMinimum H=9, if we go up every turn.\n\nLet's see if we can go directly up.\n\nAt τ=1, T=15, y=1 (if we move up at τ=0)\n\nFreeway 1: at T=15, safe, as we saw.\n\nSimilarly, at τ=2, T=16, y=2, freeway 2 safe.\n\nτ=3, T=17, y=3, freeway 3 safe.\n\nτ=4, T=18, y=4, freeway 4 safe.\n\nτ=5, T=19, y=5, freeway 5.\n\nBut freeway 5 dangerous at T=16 and 17, but T=19 is later, so should be safe? T=19, ΔT=5, freeway 5 third car span [-23+30, -12+30] = [7,18], 0 not in, and other cars safe, so yes safe.\n\nSimilarly, τ=6, T=20, y=6, freeway 6 at T=20, ΔT=6, third car span [-23+36, -12+36] = [13,24], 0 not in, safe.\n\nτ=7, T=21, y=7, freeway 7 at T=21, ΔT=7, span [-59+84, -48+84] = [25,36], 0 not in, safe.\n\nτ=8, T=22, y=8, freeway 8 always safe.\n\nτ=9, T=23, y=9, goal.\n\nBut we have dangerous times at T=16,17,18 for y=5,6,7.\n\nIn this path, at T=16, we are at y=2 (since τ=2, T=16, y=2)\n\nAt T=17, τ=3, y=3\n\nT=18, τ=4, y=4\n\nAll not on the dangerous freeways at those times.\n\ny=2 at T=16 is freeway 2, which is safe at T=16.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nBut freeway 5 is dangerous at T=16 and 17, but in this path, at T=16, we are at y=2, not y=5; at T=17, y=3, not y=5 or 6.\n\nAt T=18, freeway 7 dangerous, but we are at y=4, not y=7.\n\nSo in this case, with all U actions, we reach in 9 turns, no problem.\n\nBut let's confirm the turns.\n\nAt τ=0, T=14, position y=0, not on freeway.\n\nAction a_{t1} = a_{14} = U\n\nThen at τ=1, T=15, y=1, freeway 1: at T=15, span [1,24], 0 not in, safe.\n\nAction a_{15} = U? Actions: at each time τ, we take action to go to next position.\n\nAt time τ=0 (T=14), take action a_{14}, then position at τ=1 (T=15) is y_1 = y_0 + Δy, with Δy based on a_{14}.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nIn the sequence: start τ=0, T=14, y=0\n\nTake a_{14} = U, then at τ=1, T=15, y=1\n\nOn freeway y=1, at T=15: freeway 1 cars, span [1,24], 0 not in, safe.\n\nThen take a_{15} = U, at τ=2, T=16, y=2\n\nFreeway 2 at T=16: span for freeway 2 car, at T=16, ΔT=2, [ -11 + 36*2, 24 + 36*2 ] = [-11+72, 24+72] = [61,96], 0 not in, safe.\n\nTake a_{16} = U, at τ=3, T=17, y=3\n\nFreeway 3 at T=17: similar, span [ -11 + 36*3, 24 + 36*3 ] = [-11+108, 24+108] = [97,132], safe.\n\nTake a_{17} = U, at τ=4, T=18, y=4\n\nFreeway 4 at T=18: span [ -11 + 36*4, 24 + 36*4 ] = [-11+144, 24+144] = [133,168], safe.\n\nTake a_{18} = U, at τ=5, T=19, y=5\n\nFreeway 5 at T=19: cars, first: [49+6*5, 60+6*5] = [49+30,60+30]=[79,90], safe\n\nSecond: [13+30,24+30]=[43,54], safe\n\nThird: [-23+30, -12+30]=[7,18], 0 not in, safe.\n\nTake a_{19} = U, at τ=6, T=20, y=6\n\nFreeway 6 at T=20: similar to freeway 5, third car [ -23 + 6*6, -12 + 6*6 ] = [-23+36, -12+36]=[13,24], 0 not in, safe.\n\nTake a_{20} = U, at τ=7, T=21, y=7\n\nFreeway 7 at T=21: car span [ -59 + 12*7, -48 + 12*7 ] = [-59+84, -48+84]=[25,36], 0 not in, safe.\n\nTake a_{21} = U, at τ=8, T=22, y=8\n\nFreeway 8 at T=22: car [45 + 4*8, 56 + 4*8] = [45+32,56+32]=[77,88], safe.\n\nTake a_{22} = U, at τ=9, T=23, y=9, goal.\n\nH=9, and all safe.\n\nBut is this minimal? H=9 is the minimum possible since we need to increase y by 9.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), and we start at (0,0), so minimum 9 moves up.\n\nBut we can stay or move down, but that would take more turns, so H=9 should be achievable, and we just did.\n\nIn this case, it worked with all U.\n\nBut let me double-check if at any point we are on a dangerous freeway at dangerous time.\n\nFor example, at T=16, we are at y=2, which is freeway 2, but freeway 2 dangerous only at T=14, at T=16 it is safe.\n\nSimilarly, at T=17, y=3, freeway 3 safe.\n\nT=18, y=4, freeway 4 safe.\n\nThe dangerous times are T=16,17 for y=5 and y=6, but we are not there at those times.\n\nSimilarly, T=18 for y=7, we are at y=4.\n\nSo all good.\n\nBut the car state has multiple freeways with same cars, but we handled each.\n\nIn freeway 5 and 6, we have cars at T=16 and 17 dangerous, but we passed at T=19 and 20, safe.\n\nSimilarly for y=7 at T=21, safe.\n\nSo H=9 is possible.\n\nBut the answer should be the sequence.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from turn t_1=14 to turn t_1 + H -1 =14 +8=22? Let's see.\n\nH is the number of turns to reach, so at time τ=H, y=9.\n\nActions from τ=0 to τ=H-1.\n\nWith H=9, actions at τ=0 to 8, which is turns 14 to 22? τ=0 is turn 14, τ=1 turn 15, ..., τ=8 turn 22.\n\nAfter action at τ=8 (turn 22), position at τ=9 (turn 23), y=9.\n\nTurns: action at turn T affects position at turn T+1.\n\nAt turn 14, position is given, so action at turn 14 determines position at turn 15.\n\nAction at turn 15 determines position at turn 16, and so on.\n\nTo be at position y=9 at turn K, it means that after action at turn K-1, we have y_K = 9.\n\nFor example, at turn 14, y=0.\n\nAfter action a_14, at turn 15, y= y_14 + Δy, so if a_14=U, y_15=1.\n\nAfter a_15, y_16, etc.\n\nWe want y_T =9 for some T.\n\nMin T - 14, since start at 14.\n\nT - 14 = H, the number of steps.\n\nAt turn T, position y_T=9.\n\nSince we start at turn 14 with y=0, the earliest T is 23 if we move up every time: y_14=0, a_14=U, y_15=1, a_15=U, y_16=2, ..., a_22=U, y_23=9.\n\nSo T=23, H= T - 14 =9 actions from turn 14 to 22.\n\nIn the sequence, actions for turn 14 to turn 22.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\n\nTurn t_1 +1: a_{t_1+1}\n\n...\n\nUp to turn t_1 + H -1\n\nWith H=9, from turn 14 to 22.\n\nActions all U.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 5 and 6, at T=16 and 17, dangerous, but we are not on them then.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nBut let me confirm if at any point we might be forced to stay or something.\n\nFor example, suppose we want to be on y=5 at some time, but avoid T=16 and 17.\n\nBut in the direct path, we are at y=5 at T=19, which is fine.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps we can go faster? No, minimum 9 steps.\n\nUnless we start moving earlier, but no.\n\nAnother thing: the player can stay or move down, but that would only delay, so H larger, not smaller.\n\nSo minimal H is 9.\n\nBut in the problem, for freeway 7, dangerous at T=18, but we are at y=4 at T=18, not on y=7.\n\nAll good.\n\nBut let me see if there is any constraint that prevents moving up directly.\n\nFor example, at some point, if we were to be on a freeway when dangerous, but in this case not.\n\nPerhaps for y=0 or y=9, but they are safe.\n\nAnother thing: when moving, if we move to a freeway, we are not on it until the next turn, so no issue.\n\nIn this path, it seems fine.\n\nBut let me list the actions:\n\nTurn 14: U  (to y=1 at turn 15)\n\nTurn 15: U  (y=2 at 16)\n\nTurn 16: U  (y=3 at 17)\n\nTurn 17: U  (y=4 at 18)\n\nTurn 18: U  (y=5 at 19)\n\nTurn 19: U  (y=6 at 20)\n\nTurn 20: U  (y=7 at 21)\n\nTurn 21: U  (y=8 at 22)\n\nTurn 22: U  (y=9 at 23)\n\nNow, check collision at each position:\n\nAt turn 15 (T=15), y=1, freeway 1: span at T=15: [1,24], 0 not in, safe.\n\nTurn 16, y=2, freeway 2: at T=16, span [61,96], 0 not in, safe.\n\nTurn 17, y=3, freeway 3: similar, [97,132], safe.\n\nTurn 18, y=4, freeway 4: [133,168], safe.\n\nTurn 19, y=5, freeway 5: at T=19, cars: [79,90], [43,54], [7,18], all min x>0, 0 not in, safe.\n\nTurn 20, y=6, freeway 6: similar, third car [13,24], 0 not in, safe.\n\nTurn 21, y=7, freeway 7: at T=21, span [25,36], 0 not in, safe.\n\nTurn 22, y=8, freeway 8: [77,88], safe.\n\nTurn 23, y=9, not freeway, safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nBut the goal is to reach at turn t_1 + H -1? No.\n\nIn the task: \"reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1\" let's read.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAnd \"such that y_{t_1 + H -1} =9\"\n\nThe sequence is actions from t=0 to H-1, so a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1}\n\nAfter these actions, position at turn t_1 + H is y_{t_1 + H} = y_{t_1} + sum of Δy, but y_{t_1} =0, so y_{t_1 + H} = sum Δy from t=0 to H-1.\n\nSet to 9.\n\nSince each U adds 1, etc.\n\nIn this case, with all U, after H actions, y_{t_1 + H} = H, set to 9, so H=9.\n\nPosition at turn t_1 + H = 14 + 9 = 23 is (0,9).\n\nActions from turn 14 to 22.\n\nIn the sequence, it should be listed.\n\nBut in the answer, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc.\n\nSo for this, all actions U.\n\nBut is there a reason to do otherwise? For example, if we stayed somewhere, it would take more turns.\n\nBut since we can go directly, H=9 is minimal.\n\nBut let me see if for some freeway, it is dangerous at multiple times, but in this case, only y=5,6 at T=16,17 and y=7 at T=18, which we avoided by being there later.\n\nPerhaps we can go faster by moving down or something, but that doesn't make sense.\n\nAnother thing: the player can be at y=0 or y=9, but we start at 0, need to go to 9.\n\nPerhaps we can skip some levels, but no, we have to go through each y step by step.\n\nUnless we move multiple steps, but each action changes y by at most 1, so we must visit each integer y from 0 to 9 sequentially, but not necessarily, because we can stay or move down, so we might not visit all, but to go from 0 to 9, we must increase y by 9, so at least 9 up moves, and possibly some stays or downs, which increase H, so minimal is 9 ups with no extras.\n\nIn this case, with the car timings, it worked.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 5,6,7, the dangerous times are T=16,17,18, but since we pass later, it's fine.\n\nSuppose we were slower, and arrived at y=5 at T=16, then collision, but we don't.\n\nIn this path, we are safe.\n\nPerhaps for y=7 at T=18 dangerous, but we are at y=4 at T=18.\n\nAll good.\n\nSo I think the minimal H is 9 with all U actions.\n\nBut the problem might be that at the start, since we start at y=0, and move to y=1, etc.\n\nAnother point: in freeway 1, at T=14, it is dangerous, but we are not on it.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nSo the sequence should be:\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nTurn 20: U\n\nTurn 21: U\n\nTurn 22: U\n\nThen at turn 23, y=9.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be written as:\n\n\\boxed{ Turn 14: U \\\\ Turn 15: U \\\\ Turn 16: U \\\\ Turn 17: U \\\\ Turn 18: U \\\\ Turn 19: U \\\\ Turn 20: U \\\\ Turn 21: U \\\\ Turn 22: U }\n\nBut let me confirm the number: actions from turn 14 to 22, that's 9 actions.\n\nH=9.\n\nBut in the box, it should be as per the format.\n\nPerhaps I need to specify for each turn.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 5 and 6, there are multiple cars, but I think I covered.\n\nFreeway 5 has cars that are safe except the third one at certain times.\n\nBut in the path, no issue.\n\nPerhaps the player can move down to avoid, but no need.\n\nI think this is correct.\n\nBut the initial position is (0,0), and freeways start from y=1, so moving up to y=1 is fine.\n\nPerhaps at some point, if we stay, but no benefit.\n\nSo I believe this is the solution.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 0) on turn 14 and needs to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. The car states indicate that freeways 5 and 6 are dangerous at turns 16 and 17, and freeway 7 is dangerous at turn 18. However, by moving up (U) every turn starting from turn 14, the player reaches y=9 in 9 turns (by turn 23) without being on any dangerous freeway at the dangerous times:\n\n- At turn 15 (y=1), freeway 1 is safe (span [1,24], 0 not included).\n- At turn 16 (y=2), freeway 2 is safe (span [61,96], 0 not included).\n- At turn 17 (y=3), freeway 3 is safe (span [97,132], 0 not included).\n- At turn 18 (y=4), freeway 4 is safe (span [133,168], 0 not included).\n- At turn 19 (y=5), freeway 5 is safe (spans [79,90], [43,54], [7,18]; 0 not in any span).\n- At turn 20 (y=6), freeway 6 is safe (spans [79,90], [43,54], [13,24]; 0 not in any span).\n- At turn 21 (y=7), freeway 7 is safe (span [25,36], 0 not included).\n- At turn 22 (y=8), freeway 8 is safe (span [77,88], 0 not included).\n- At turn 23 (y=9), the goal is reached safely (not a freeway).\n\nThis path achieves the minimum H=9 turns, as at least 9 up moves are required to increase y from 0 to 9, and no collisions occur. Any deviation (e.g., staying or moving down) would increase H.\n\nThe sequence of actions is:\n\n\\boxed{ Turn 14: U \\\\ Turn 15: U \\\\ Turn 16: U \\\\ Turn 17: U \\\\ Turn 18: U \\\\ Turn 19: U \\\\ Turn 20: U \\\\ Turn 21: U \\\\ Turn 22: U }",

        "thinking": "<think>We are given the current turn t1 = 15, and the player is at (0,1). The goal is to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on the freeways (y=1 to 8).\n\nThe player can move up (U: +1), down (D: -1), or stay (S: 0). The y-coordinate is bounded between 0 and 9.\n\nWe note that collision occurs at turn T if the player is on a freeway y (from 1 to 8) and the car on that freeway at turn T has a span that includes 0 (the x-coordinate of the player) at that exact turn.\n\nImportant: When moving from y_T to y_{T+1} at turn T, the player is considered to be on y_T at turn T (so only the car on freeway y_T at turn T matters). Then at the next turn (T+1), the player is on y_{T+1}.\n\nWe are given the state of the cars at turn t1=15. We need to simulate the car positions for future turns T (>=15) using:\n  For a car at turn t1: \n    If left-moving: span at T is [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]\n    If right-moving: span at T is [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut note: the table gives the state at t1=15. For example, on freeway 1: (24, 1, right, 24). \n  Since it's right-moving, at turn T, the car's span is [1 + 24*(T-15), 24 + 24*(T-15)].\n\nHowever, note the representation: for right-moving, the head is at h and tail at τ? But the update rule says for right-moving: [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]. \n  In the table, the car is given as (head, tail, direction, speed). So for freeway 1: head=24, tail=1, direction=right, speed=24.\n\nBut in the update for right-moving, we use [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]? \n  Here τ=1, h=24 -> so at T, [1 + 24*(T-15), 24 + 24*(T-15)].\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving we would use [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)].\n\nWe must avoid being on a freeway y (from 1 to 8) at a turn T when there is a car on that freeway whose span includes 0 at T.\n\nThe player starts at (0,1) at turn 15. We wish to reach (0,9). We can only change by at most 1 per turn, so we must go upward. However, we must avoid the freeways at the moments when we are on them and a car is at 0.\n\nWe are to find the minimal number of turns H and the sequence of actions.\n\nApproach:\nWe can model the state as (turn, y) and we wish to go from (15,1) to some (T,9) with minimal T (so H = T - 15 + 1? Note: we start at turn 15 and take actions at turn 15, 16, ... until the turn when we first reach 9. So if we reach at turn T, then H = T - 15 + 1, and the actions are from t=15 to t=T-1? Actually, we take H actions: from t=15 to t=15+H-1, and then at turn 15+H we have the position. But note the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning a_{t1} (t=0) to a_{t1+H-1} (t=H-1). Then the position after H actions (at turn t1+H) is at (0,9). \n\nSo we start at turn t1=15 at y=1. Then we take an action at turn 15 (which will move us to y=1,0, or 2 at turn 16? Actually, the update is: at turn t, we are at y_t. Then we choose a_t, and then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nTherefore, the state at turn t1=15 is fixed: (15,1). Then we choose a_15, then at turn 16 we are at y_16 = y_15 + Δy_15.\n\nWe wish to be at y=9 at some turn T (>=15). Actually, note: we are at (0, y_t) at turn t. We start at turn 15 at (0,1). We must be at (0,9) at the last turn of the sequence. The actions are taken at turns 15, 16, ... until the turn when we are at 9. But note: we are at 9 at the next turn after the last action. \n\nExample: if we do nothing (S) for 8 turns, then at turn 15 we are at 1, then turn 16:1, ... turn23:1. Then we start moving up? \n\nActually, we need to move from 1 to 9: that requires 8 moves upward. But we can also move down? But that would be inefficient. So the minimal H without cars would be 8: we do U 8 times. Then we are at turn 15+8 = 23 at position 1+8=9.\n\nBut with cars, we might have to wait or detour? However, we cannot go above 9 or below 0. And we are starting at 1 and going to 9: we must go upward. But we might have to wait (stay) on a safe row to avoid a car.\n\nSo we need to simulate the car movements and check for collisions.\n\nWe note that the cars are on fixed freeways and move horizontally. The player moves vertically.\n\nWe are only concerned with freeways 1 to 8 (since we are never on freeway 0 or 9? Actually, the player is at y=0 and y=9 as well, but the freeways with cars are only 1-8. And collision is defined only when on a freeway from 1 to 8. So at y=0 and y=9, there are no cars. Therefore, we are safe at y=0 and y=9.\n\nSo the player can wait at y=0 or y=9 without being hit by a car.\n\nWe start at y=1 (freeway 1) at turn 15. We must avoid being on freeway y (1..8) when a car on that freeway has 0 in its span at that turn.\n\nWe need to compute for each freeway and for each turn T (starting from 15) the set of freeways that are unsafe (i.e., have a car at 0) at that turn.\n\nBut note: a freeway might have multiple cars. For example, freeway 5 has three cars. We have to check each car on the freeway: if any one of them has 0 in its span at turn T, then that freeway is unsafe at turn T.\n\nWe are going to precompute the safety of each freeway for a range of turns. Since the minimal time to go from 1 to 9 is 8 turns, we might need to consider up to 20 turns? But we don't know how long we might have to wait. However, note that the cars move continuously and periodically? Actually, the cars move at constant speed, but the freeway might become safe again.\n\nBut note: the cars are moving at integer speeds and the positions are integers? The problem states that the head and tail are integers and the speed is integer. So the car positions are integers.\n\nWe are going to compute for each freeway k (1 to 8) and for each turn T (from 15 to, say, 15+50) whether freeway k is safe at turn T (i.e., no car on freeway k has 0 in its span at T).\n\nWe are going to write a function safe(k, T) that returns True if freeway k is safe at turn T.\n\nHow to compute safe(k, T):\n  For each car on freeway k (given at turn t1=15):\n    Let (h, τ, d, s) = car description.\n    If d is 'right', then the car at turn T is [τ + s*(T-15), h + s*(T-15)].\n        Then 0 is in the span if τ + s*(T-15) <= 0 <= h + s*(T-15).\n    If d is 'left', then [h - s*(T-15), τ - s*(T-15)] and check if h - s*(T-15) <= 0 <= τ - s*(T-15).\n\nBut note: for right-moving, the representation in the table is (head, tail) and the update uses [tail + s*(T-15), head + s*(T-15)]? \n  However, the problem says: for right-moving: [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)] and for left-moving: [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)].\n\nBut the table gives for a car: (head, tail, direction, speed). So we must interpret head and tail correctly.\n\nLooking at the example: freeway 1: (24, 1, right, 24). At T=15: [1+24*0, 24+24*0] = [1,24] -> 0 is not in [1,24] -> safe at T=15? But the player is at (0,1) at turn 15. So we are on freeway 1 at turn 15. We must check: is 0 in [1,24]? It is not. So safe.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T\". So at turn 15, we are at freeway 1, and 0 is not in the span -> safe.\n\nNow, let's compute for freeway 1 at turn 16: [1+24*(1), 24+24*(1)] = [25,48] -> 0 not in [25,48] -> safe.\nAt turn 15: [1,24] -> safe.\n\nBut what about turn 15.5? We don't have fractional turns. Only integer turns.\n\nWe are only concerned with integer T.\n\nWe'll compute for each freeway k and for T in a range.\n\nWe note that the cars move and eventually the spans will move away from 0? Or might come back? Actually, because the cars are moving at constant speed and the grid is infinite, the danger is periodic? But note: the car might wrap? The problem does not say anything about wrapping. So the car moves indefinitely in one direction.\n\nWe must be cautious: the car might leave and then come back? But without wrapping, it won't come back. However, note the problem does not specify boundaries for the cars. They just move. So once the entire span is to the right of 0, then unless the speed is negative (which it isn't, since they are moving right or left) and the car is long enough, it might come back? Actually, no: if a car is moving right with positive speed, it will move to the right forever. Similarly, a left-moving car (with negative speed? but the problem says the direction is left or right and the speed is positive) will move to the left forever.\n\nBut wait: the update for left-moving uses subtraction. So the head and tail both decrease by s per turn. So the entire car moves left.\n\nTherefore, a car that passes 0 might never return? Actually, if a car is moving right and passes 0, then after that it will be to the right of 0 and never come back. Similarly, a left-moving car that passes 0 will be to the left and never come back.\n\nBut note: we have multiple cars on a freeway. And some freeways have multiple cars.\n\nWe are going to compute for each car the set of turns T (>=15) when it covers 0.\n\nFor a car (h, τ, d, s) on freeway k:\n\nIf d == 'right':\n  The car covers 0 at turn T if:\n      τ + s*(T-15) <= 0 <= h + s*(T-15)\n\nWe can solve for T:\n\n  τ + s*(T-15) <= 0  => T <= ( - τ ) / s + 15\n  and \n  0 <= h + s*(T-15)  => T >= ( - h ) / s + 15\n\nBut note: we must be cautious because the inequalities are inclusive. Actually, we have:\n\n  Lower bound: τ + s*(T-15) <= 0  -> T <= ( - τ ) / s + 15   [if s>0, then this is an upper bound]\n  Upper bound: 0 <= h + s*(T-15) -> T >= ( - h ) / s + 15   [if s>0, then this is a lower bound]\n\nWait, let me rearrange:\n\n  τ + s*(T-15) <= 0   => s*(T-15) <= -τ   => T-15 <= -τ/s   => T <= 15 - τ/s\n\nBut τ is negative? In the table, τ can be negative? Yes, for example freeway 5: (-48, -59, ...). So τ=-59, s=6: then T <= 15 - (-59)/6 = 15 + 59/6 ≈ 15+9.83 -> T<=24.83 -> so T<=24? But T is integer.\n\nActually, we must do integer inequalities.\n\nWe can compute the interval:\n\n  Start: the smallest T (>=15) such that h + s*(T-15) >= 0? Actually, we have two conditions:\n\n  Condition 1: τ + s*(T-15) <= 0   [the left end is <=0]\n  Condition 2: h + s*(T-15) >= 0   [the right end is >=0]\n\nBut note: the car is [τ + s*(T-15), h + s*(T-15)] and we require 0 in [low, high] so: low <= 0 <= high.\n\nSo:\n  τ + s*(T-15) <= 0   => T <= ceil( ( - τ ) / s + 15 )? Actually, we have:\n\n  T must satisfy: \n      τ + s*(T-15) <= 0   => T <= ( - τ ) / s + 15   [if s>0, then we can write T <= floor(( - τ ) / s + 15) ???]\n\nBut let's do with integers: \n\n  Condition 1: τ + s*(T-15) <= 0  -> T <= ( - τ - 1 ) // s + 15? Not exactly.\n\nWe can compute:\n\n  T_min_right = ceil( ( - h ) / s + 15 )   ??? \n\nActually, from condition 2: h + s*(T-15) >= 0 -> s*(T-15) >= -h -> T-15 >= ceil(-h/s)   if s>0? But note: if h is negative, then -h is positive.\n\nLet me do with an example.\n\nFor freeway 5 car1: (h, τ, d, s) = (-48, -59, right, 6)\n  At T, the car is [ -59 + 6*(T-15), -48 + 6*(T-15) ]\n\nWe want:\n  -59 + 6*(T-15) <= 0 <= -48 + 6*(T-15)\n\nSolve:\n  First inequality: -59 + 6*(T-15) <= 0 -> 6*(T-15) <= 59 -> T-15 <= 59/6 ≈ 9.833 -> T <= 24.833 -> T<=24 (since integer)\n  Second inequality: 0 <= -48 + 6*(T-15) -> 48 <= 6*(T-15) -> 8 <= T-15 -> T>=23\n\nSo T in [23,24] -> T=23 and 24.\n\nCheck:\n  T=23: \n      low = -59 + 6*(8) = -59+48 = -11\n      high = -48 + 48 = 0\n      So [ -11, 0] -> includes 0? yes, at the boundary? the problem says \"includes\", and 0 is the right endpoint? so yes.\n\n  T=24:\n      low = -59 + 6*9 = -59+54 = -5\n      high = -48+54=6\n      So [ -5,6] -> includes 0.\n\nSo freeway 5 is unsafe at T=23 and 24 due to this car? But note: there are three cars on freeway 5. We have to check each.\n\nSimilarly, the other cars on freeway 5: \n  (30, 19, right, 6): \n      This car: [19 + 6*(T-15), 30 + 6*(T-15)]\n      We require: 19+6*(T-15) <= 0 <= 30+6*(T-15)\n      First: 19+6*(T-15) <= 0 -> 6*(T-15) <= -19 -> T-15 <= -19/6 ≈ -3.16 -> T<=11.83 -> but T>=15, so no solution? So this car never covers 0 for T>=15.\n\n  Third car: (-6, -17, right, 6): \n      [-17+6*(T-15), -6+6*(T-15)]\n      Conditions:\n        -17+6*(T-15) <= 0 -> 6*(T-15) <= 17 -> T<=15+17/6≈15+2.83 -> T<=17.83 -> T<=17\n        and 0 <= -6+6*(T-15) -> 6*(T-15) >=6 -> T>=16\n      So T in [16,17] -> T=16,17.\n\nSo freeway 5 is unsafe at:\n  T=16,17 (from third car) and T=23,24 (from first car).\n\nTherefore, at T=15: freeway 5 is safe? \n  First car: [-59, -48] -> 0 not in between? \n  Second car: [19,30] -> no\n  Third car: [-17,-6] -> no? because -17<=0<=-6? but 0 is not between -17 and -6? Actually, -17<=0 is true, but 0<=-6 is false. So 0 is not in [-17,-6]. \n\nSo freeway 5 is safe at T=15.\n\nWe must do this for every freeway and every car.\n\nWe'll create a set of unsafe turns for each freeway.\n\nBut note: we are going to simulate from T=15 to T_max (we'll set T_max to 15+50, but if we can find a path within 20 turns, that should be enough).\n\nWe are going to do a BFS (or Dijkstra, but all step costs are 1) in state (turn, y) to find the minimal turns to reach y=9.\n\nThe state: (turn, y) with turn>=15 and y in [0,9].\n\nWe start at (15,1). The goal is to reach any (T,9) for T>=15.\n\nWe can move: at state (t,y), we choose an action a in {U, D, S}. Then next state is (t+1, y + dy), where dy = 1 for U, -1 for D, 0 for S, but clamped to [0,9]? Actually, the problem says y_{t+1} in [0,9]. So if y=0 and we choose D, we stay at 0? Similarly, y=9 and U -> stay at 9.\n\nBut note: we can go to y=0 and y=9 and they are safe (no cars). So we can use them as shelters.\n\nThe transition: \n  If the next state (t+1, y') is such that y' is between 1 and 8, then we must check that at turn t+1, freeway y' is safe? \n  But note: at turn t, we are at y_t. Then we choose a_t, and then at turn t+1 we are at y_{t+1}=y_t + a_t. And at turn t+1, we are on freeway y_{t+1}. So if y_{t+1} is in [1,8], then we must check that freeway y_{t+1} is safe at turn t+1.\n\nHowever, note: what if we are at y_t = 0 and we choose U? Then at turn t+1 we are at y_{t+1}=1. Then we must check freeway 1 at turn t+1.\n\nSimilarly, if we are at y_t=1 and we choose S, then we are at 1 at turn t+1 -> check freeway 1 at turn t+1.\n\nBut if we are at y_t=1 and we choose D, then we go to 0 at turn t+1 -> no car at 0 -> safe.\n\nTherefore, the safety check for the next state (t+1, y') is:\n  If y' is 0 or 9, then safe.\n  Else (y' in [1,8]), then check if freeway y' is safe at turn t+1.\n\nWe precomputed for each freeway k and for each turn T (from 15 to T_max) a boolean: safe(k, T) = True if no car on k at T has 0 in its span.\n\nThen the next state (t+1, y') is valid only if:\n   if y' in [1,8]: then safe(y', t+1) must be True.\n   if y' in {0,9}: always True.\n\nWe do a BFS starting from (15,1) and we wish to reach any (t,9) with minimal t.\n\nThe cost of each step is 1 (turn). We want the minimal turns.\n\nWe'll let T_max be 15+40 (to be safe).\n\nWe'll precompute the unsafe sets for each freeway and for turns 15 to 55 (so 40 turns).\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Precomputation for freeways 1 to 8 and for T in [15, 55]:\n   For each freeway k, for each car on k:\n        if direction is 'right':\n            low = τ + s*(T-15)\n            high = h + s*(T-15)\n            if low <= 0 <= high, then freeway k is unsafe at T (due to this car). If at least one car makes it unsafe, then unsafe.\n        if direction is 'left':\n            low = h - s*(T-15)   # note: the head becomes the left end? \n            high = τ - s*(T-15)   # and tail becomes the right end? But the update rule: [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)] and then we check if 0 is in [low, high]. But note: if the car is left-moving, then the head is the leftmost? Actually, the update rule says: for left-moving: the span is [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]. But in the table, the car is given as (head, tail, ...). \n\n        However, note: the problem does not specify which of head and tail is left or right. But the update rule for left-moving uses [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]. So we assume the car spans from h to τ? and then moves left? \n\n        But in the table, for freeway 7: (-36, -47, right, 12) -> wait, no: freeway 7: (-36, -47, right, 12) -> but wait, the direction is right? So we use the right-moving update. \n\n        Actually, all the cars in the given state are right-moving? \n\n        Checking:\n          freeway 1: right\n          freeway 2: right\n          freeway 3: right\n          freeway 4: right\n          freeway 5: three cars, all right\n          freeway 6: same as 5? but the table says: same as 5? Actually, the table says:\n            | 5 | (-48, -59, right, 6), (30, 19, right, 6), (-6, -17, right, 6) |\n            | 6 | same as 5? \n            | 7 | (-36, -47, right, 12) -> but wait, direction is right? \n            | 8 | (60,49,right,4)\n\n        Actually, freeway 8: (60,49,right,4): but 60>49, so head=60, tail=49? Then for right-moving: [49+4*(T-15), 60+4*(T-15)] -> which is increasing? So at T=15: [49,60] -> safe.\n\n        But note: the representation: in the update rule for right-moving, we use [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]. So we must use the tail and head as given? \n\n        Therefore, we'll use the provided (h, τ) and the direction.\n\n        For freeway 8: tail=49? head=60? Then at T=15: [49,60] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\n        So all cars are right-moving? Then we don't have left-moving.\n\n        Therefore, we only need to do the right-moving computation.\n\n   For each freeway k and each T, we set:\n        safe(k, T) = True\n        for each car in freeway_k:\n            low = tail + s*(T-15)\n            high = head + s*(T-15)\n            if low <= 0 <= high:\n                safe(k, T) = False\n                break out of car loop? (since one car makes it unsafe)\n\n   But note: the table for freeway 5 and 6 have multiple cars.\n\n2. BFS:\n\n   We'll use a queue: each state is (turn, y)\n   We start: (15,1) with path [].\n\n   We maintain a visited set: (turn, y) to avoid revisiting? But note: we can be at the same y at a later turn and that might be necessary (if we wait). However, if we are at (t1,y) and we have a state (t2,y) with t2>t1, then if we can get to the goal faster from (t1,y) we don't need (t2,y). But actually, because we are minimizing the total turns, and each step is 1, then if we are at (t,y) and we have a way to the goal that takes K steps, then the total turns will be t + K - 15. So if we have two states (t1,y) and (t2,y) with t2>t1, then the state (t1,y) is always better? So we can use the earliest time we reached y? \n\n   Actually, we are doing BFS by increasing turn. So we can mark for each y the earliest turn we reached it? Then if we reach y at turn t, we don't need to consider the same y at a later turn? \n\n   But caution: sometimes a detour might require going back to a row at a later time? However, note that we are going upward and we can also go down. But if we are at y and we have two ways: one that arrives at t1 and then we can go to 9 in k1 steps, and one that arrives at t2>t1 and then goes to 9 in k2 steps, and if k1 is the same as k2? then the total time is t1+k1 and t2+k2. Since t1<t2, then t1+k1 < t2+k2. So the first one is better. But what if the path from the first one has to wait? Then the second one might be better? \n\n   Actually, no: because we can always wait at a safe spot (like 0 or 9) arbitrarily. So if we get to y at t1, we can then wait until t2 and then do the same moves as the second path. So the first arrival is always better. Therefore, we can use:\n\n      visited[y] = the earliest turn we have reached y.\n\n   However, note: we might have a state that arrives at y at a later turn but then has a shorter path to 9? But since we can always wait, the minimal time to go from y to 9 is fixed? Actually, no: because the safety of the rows changes with time. \n\n   Therefore, we must consider the turn as part of the state.\n\n   We'll use a 2D visited array: for turn from 15 to T_max and y in 0..9. We mark visited[turn][y] = True if we have reached (turn,y).\n\n   We do BFS by increasing turn.\n\n   Steps:\n\n      Let T_max = 55 (so we consider up to turn 55).\n\n      Create a 2D array visited[16..55][0..9] = False. (but we start at turn15, so we'll include turn15 as well? but we start at turn15 and then we go to turn16, etc.)\n\n      We start at (15,1). We haven't taken any action yet? But the problem says we are at turn15 at y=1. Then we are going to take an action at turn15, which leads to turn16.\n\n      Actually, the state at turn15 is (15,1). Then we choose an action for turn15, which leads to state (16, y') for y' in {0,1,2} (since from y=1: U->2, D->0, S->1).\n\n      So we generate states for turn16.\n\n      We mark visited[15][1] = True.\n\n      Then we consider:\n\n          From (15,1): \n             a15 = U -> (16,2) -> then check: at turn16, we are at y=2 -> freeway2. Check safe(2,16)? \n             a15 = D -> (16,0) -> safe (y=0)\n             a15 = S -> (16,1) -> check freeway1 at turn16.\n\n      Then we push these states.\n\n      We wish to reach (T,9) for any T.\n\n      We'll do:\n\n          queue = deque()\n          queue.append( (turn, y, path) )   # path: list of actions taken so far (from turn15 to the current turn-1)\n\n          Start: (15,1, [])\n\n          Then we pop state (turn, y, path) and if we haven't visited (turn,y) then we mark it and then for each action a in [U,D,S]:\n              next_y = y + dy(a)   clamped to [0,9]\n              next_turn = turn+1\n              If next_y is 0 or 9: safe = True\n              Else: safe = safe_table[ next_y ][ next_turn ]   # which we precomputed: safe_table[k][t] for k in 1..8 and t in 15..55.\n\n          But note: the safe_table we computed for a freeway k and turn T: is that the safety at turn T? yes.\n\n          However, the next state is (next_turn, next_y). And if next_y is in [1,8], we check safe_table[k=next_y][T=next_turn].\n\n          If safe, then we push (next_turn, next_y, path + [a]).\n\n          If next_y==9, then we have reached the goal at turn next_turn. Then we output the path: it has length (next_turn - 15) because we started at turn15 and took actions at 15,16,...,next_turn-1? Actually, the actions are from turn15 to turn (next_turn-1). The number of actions = next_turn - 15.\n\n          And we want minimal H = next_turn - 15? But the problem says H is the minimal number of turns? and the sequence is for t=0 to H-1: meaning a_{t1} to a_{t1+H-1}. Then the turn at which we are at 9 is t1 + H. \n\n          How? \n            At turn t1=15, we take the first action a_{15} (which is the first in the sequence) and then at turn16 we are at y16.\n            Then at turn t1+H-1 we take the last action, and then at turn t1+H we are at y=9.\n\n          Therefore, H = (next_turn - 15) because next_turn = 15 + H.\n\n          So when we reach next_y=9 at next_turn, then H = next_turn - 15, and the sequence is the path.\n\n          Since we are doing BFS by increasing next_turn, the first time we reach y=9 is the minimal H.\n\n      However, we must generate states in increasing turn order. We can use a queue (BFS by time).\n\nImplementation:\n\n   Precomputation:\n\n      safe_table = 2D list: for freeway k in 1..8, and for turn T in 15..55: initialize as True.\n\n      For freeway k from 1 to 8:\n          For each car in the freeway:\n              (h, τ, d, s) = car   # note: d is always 'right' in this problem\n              For T from 15 to 55:\n                  low = τ + s*(T-15)\n                  high = h + s*(T-15)\n                  if low <= 0 <= high:\n                      safe_table[k][T] = False   # mark unsafe\n\n      Note: we are storing by freeway index k and T.\n\n   Then BFS:\n\n      Let visited = 2D array for turns 15..55 and y in 0..9: all False.\n\n      queue = deque([(15, 1, [])])   # (turn, y, actions_so_far)\n\n      visited[15][1] = True\n\n      while queue:\n          pop state (t, y, path)\n          if t+1 > 55: break? but we set T_max=55, so we don't go beyond.\n\n          for each action in ['U','D','S']:\n              next_y = y + change[action]   # change: U:+1, D:-1, S:0\n              next_y = max(0, min(9, next_y))\n              next_turn = t+1\n\n              # Check if we have been at (next_turn, next_y) before?

So we are going to at least 15+8=23. We set T_max=55: that's 40 steps, which should be plenty.\n\nNow, let's precompute the unsafe freeways:\n\nWe'll do for freeways 1 to 8 and T from 15 to 55.\n\nFreeway 1: (24,1,right,24) -> [1+24*(T-15), 24+24*(T-15)]\n   Conditions: 1+24*(T-15) <=0 and 0<=24+24*(T-15) -> \n        1+24*(T-15) <=0 -> 24*(T-15) <= -1 -> T-15 <= -1/24 -> T<=14.95 -> no T>=15 -> safe at all T.\n\nFreeway 2: (60,25,right,36) -> [25+36*(T-15), 60+36*(T-15)]\n   Conditions: 25+36*(T-15) <=0 -> 36*(T-15) <= -25 -> T-15 <= -25/36 -> T<=14.3 -> safe at all T>=15.\n\nFreeway 3: same as 2? -> safe.\n\nFreeway 4: same as 2? -> safe.\n\nFreeway 5: three cars.\n   Car1: (-48, -59, right, 6): \n        [ -59 + 6*(T-15), -48 + 6*(T-15) ]\n        -59+6*(T-15) <=0 -> 6*(T-15)<=59 -> T-15<=59/6≈9.83 -> T<=24.83 -> T<=24\n        0<=-48+6*(T-15) -> 48<=6*(T-15) -> T-15>=8 -> T>=23\n        So T in [23,24] -> unsafe at T=23,24.\n\n   Car2: (30,19,right,6): \n        [19+6*(T-15), 30+6*(T-15)]\n        19+6*(T-15)<=0 -> 6*(T-15)<=-19 -> T-15<=-19/6≈-3.16 -> T<=11.83 -> no T>=15 -> safe.\n\n   Car3: (-6,-17,right,6):\n        [-17+6*(T-15), -6+6*(T-15)]\n        -17+6*(T-15)<=0 -> 6*(T-15)<=17 -> T-15<=17/6≈2.83 -> T<=17.83 -> T<=17\n        0<=-6+6*(T-15) -> 6*(T-15)>=6 -> T-15>=1 -> T>=16\n        So T in [16,17] -> unsafe at T=16,17.\n\n   So freeway5: unsafe at T=16,17,23,24.\n\nFreeway6: same as freeway5 -> same unsafe turns: 16,17,23,24.\n\nFreeway7: (-36,-47,right,12) -> [-47+12*(T-15), -36+12*(T-15)]\n        -47+12*(T-15)<=0 -> 12*(T-15)<=47 -> T-15<=47/12≈3.91 -> T<=18.91 -> T<=18\n        0<=-36+12*(T-15) -> 36<=12*(T-15) -> T-15>=3 -> T>=18\n        So T=18: \n            low = -47+12*3 = -47+36 = -11\n            high = -36+36=0 -> so [ -11,0] -> includes 0 -> unsafe at T=18.\n        Also T=17: \n            low = -47+12*2 = -47+24 = -23\n            high = -36+24 = -12 -> 0 not in [-23,-12] -> safe.\n        T=18: unsafe.\n\n        Also T=19: \n            low = -47+12*4 = -47+48=1 -> [1, -36+48=12] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n        So only T=18.\n\n        But wait: at T=18: \n            Condition: -47+12*(18-15)= -47+36 = -11 <=0, and -36+36=0 -> so 0 is the right endpoint -> included.\n\n        So freeway7: unsafe at T=18.\n\nFreeway8: (60,49,right,4) -> [49+4*(T-15), 60+4*(T-15)]\n        Conditions: 49+4*(T-15)<=0 -> 4*(T-15)<=-49 -> T-15<=-49/4≈-12.25 -> no T>=15 -> safe.\n\nSummary of unsafe freeways and turns:\n\n   freeway5: T in {16,17,23,24}\n   freeway6: same as 5: {16,17,23,24}\n   freeway7: {18}\n\nAll others are safe for all T.\n\nNow, we do BFS.\n\nWe start at (15,1) and we wish to get to 9.\n\nWe note that we are at (15,1): safe? yes, because freeway1 is safe at T=15.\n\nThen we consider three actions at turn15:\n\n   U: next_y=2 -> at turn16, freeway2: safe?

So if we are going to row5 at turn17, we crash? \n\nBut we are not at row5 at turn17? \n\nWe are at 0,1,2,3 at turn17 -> so safe.\n\nNow, from each state at turn17:\n\n(17,0): \n   U:1 -> freeway1 at turn18: safe -> (18,1)\n   D:0 -> (18,0)\n   S:0 -> (18,0)\n\n(17,1):\n   U:2 -> freeway2 at turn18: safe -> (18,2)\n   D:0 -> (18,0)\n   S:1 -> freeway1 at turn18: safe -> (18,1)\n\n(17,2):\n   U:3 -> freeway3 at turn18: safe -> (18,3)\n   D:1 -> freeway1 at turn18: safe -> (18,1)\n   S:2 -> freeway2 at turn18: safe -> (18,2)\n\n(17,3):\n   U:4 -> freeway4 at turn18: safe -> (18,4)\n   D:2 -> freeway2 at turn18: safe -> (18,2)\n   S:3 -> freeway3 at turn18: safe -> (18,3)\n\nBut note: freeway7 is unsafe at turn18! and freeway7 is row7? So if we go to row7 at turn18, we crash. But we are not going to row7 yet.\n\nNow at turn18, we have:\n\n   (18,0): from (17,0) with D or S\n   (18,1): from (17,0) with U, or (17,1) with S, or (17,2) with D\n   (18,2): from (17,1) with U, or (17,2) with S, or (17,3) with D\n   (18,3): from (17,2) with U, or (17,3) with S\n   (18,4): from (17,3) with U\n\nBut note: if we are at (17,4) we could go to 5? but we don't have state at (17,4) yet.\n\nNow, at turn18: \n   freeway7 (row7) is unsafe -> so we cannot be at row7 at turn18. \n   Also freeway5 and 6 are unsafe only at 16,17,23,24 -> so at turn18, freeway5 and 6 are safe.\n\nSo the states above are safe.\n\nWe continue.\n\nBut we are moving upward: we have state (18,4). We can go to 5? \n\nAt (18,4): \n   U:5 -> freeway5 at turn19: safe? freeway5 unsafe only at 16,17,23,24 -> 19 is safe -> (19,5)\n   D:3 -> (19,3)\n   S:4 -> freeway4 at turn19: safe -> (19,4)\n\nSimilarly, we can also have states at (18,0) to (18,4).\n\nWe want to get to 9 as fast as possible. So the fastest way is to go upward without delay.\n\nBut we have to avoid row5 at turn23,24? and row7 at turn18? but we are not on row7 at turn18.\n\nWe are at turn18 and we are at row4. Then we can go:\n\n   turn18: at 4 -> U to 5 at turn19: safe (freeway5 at 19: safe) -> then at 5 at turn19.\n\n   Then we can continue upward: \n        turn19: at 5 -> U to 6 at turn20: safe (freeway6 at 20: safe) -> (20,6)\n        turn20: at 6 -> U to 7 at turn21: freeway7 at turn21: safe? freeway7 unsafe only at 18 -> safe -> (21,7)\n        turn21: at 7 -> U to 8 at turn22: freeway8: safe -> (22,8)\n        turn22: at 8 -> U to 9 at turn23: then we are at 9 at turn23 -> goal.\n\nSo the sequence: \n   turn15: start at 1\n   turn15: U -> 2 at turn16\n   turn16: U -> 3 at turn17\n   turn17: U -> 4 at turn18\n   turn18: U -> 5 at turn19\n   turn19: U -> 6 at turn20\n   turn20: U -> 7 at turn21\n   turn21: U -> 8 at turn22\n   turn22: U -> 9 at turn23\n\nBut wait: we started at (15,1). Then:\n\n   turn15: action U -> at turn16: y=2\n   turn16: action U -> at turn17: y=3\n   turn17: action U -> at turn18: y=4\n   turn18: action U -> at turn19: y=5\n   turn19: action U -> at turn20: y=6\n   turn20: action U -> at turn21: y=7\n   turn21: action U -> at turn22: y=8\n   turn22: action U -> at turn23: y=9\n\nSo 8 actions: from turn15 to turn22 (8 actions: 15,16,...,22) and we are at 9 at turn23.\n\nBut we must check the safety:\n\n   At turn19: at freeway5 -> safe? because freeway5 is unsafe only at 16,17,23,24 -> 19 is safe -> ok.\n   At turn20: freeway6: unsafe at 16,17,23,24 -> 20 safe -> ok.\n   At turn21: freeway7: unsafe only at 18 -> safe -> ok.\n   At turn22: freeway8: safe -> ok.\n\nSo the sequence is: U, U, U, U, U, U, U, U\n\nBut wait: we started at 1. We need 8 steps to go to 9. \n\nBut the problem says: the initial position is (0,1). We are to reach (0,9). \n\nSo the minimal H is 8.\n\nBut let me check if we can do it faster? We are at 1 and need to go to 9: 8 moves up. So minimal H=8.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nTurn t_1: U\nTurn t_1+1: U\n...\nTurn t_1+7: U   (for t_1=15, then actions at 15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22)\n\nBut the problem says: the sequence is from t=0 to H-1: meaning a_{t1} to a_{t1+H-1}. So 8 actions: from turn15 to turn22.\n\nBut we must write the answer for the given t_1=15.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 15: U\nTurn 16: U\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\nTurn 19: U\nTurn 20: U\nTurn 21: U\nTurn 22: U\n\nBut wait: at turn19 we are at freeway5: which is safe? yes. \n\nHowever, note: at turn23 and 24, freeway5 is unsafe. But we are at freeway5 at turn19 -> safe.\n\nBut what if we try to go faster? We can't: we need 8 moves.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 8.\n\nBut wait: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\". And we have H=8.\n\nBut let me confirm the initial state: at turn15 we are at (0,1). Then we take 8 actions: U at turns 15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22. Then at turn23 we are at (0,9).\n\nSo the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 15: U\nTurn 16: U\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\nTurn 19: U\nTurn 20: U\nTurn 21: U\nTurn 22: U\n}\n\nBut wait: the problem says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{H-1}\".\n\nHere, H=8, so t from 0 to 7: \n   t=0: a_{15} = U\n   t=1: a_{16}=U\n   ...\n   t=7: a_{22}=U\n\nSo the last action is at turn22.\n\nWe are at (0,9) at turn23.\n\nBut the problem says: \"reach (0,9)\" at the end of the sequence. So we are at (0,9) at turn23, which is after 8 actions.\n\nTherefore, the answer is as above.\n\nBut note: we must be cautious about the freeway5 at turn19: we are at row5 at turn19 -> safe? yes.\n\nSimilarly, row6 at turn20: safe.\n\nSo we are safe.\n\nTherefore, we output the 8 U's.\n\nBut what if there was a problem? Then we might have to wait. But in this case, we don't.\n\nSo the minimal H is 8.\n\nBut let me see if we can do it in 7? \n   To go from 1 to 9: we need 8 steps: 1->2->3->4->5->6->7->8->9: that's 8 moves. \n   So no.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 8 U's.\n\nWe'll write the answer accordingly.\n\nNote: the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H\". We have H=8.\n\nBut note: the problem also says \"avoid collisions\". We did.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 15: U\nTurn 16: U\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\nTurn 19: U\nTurn 20: U\nTurn 21: U\nTurn 22: U\n}\n\nBut wait: the problem says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" and so on. We have t_1=15.\n\nTherefore, we write the turns explicitly.\n\nBut the problem says \"Turn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1+1}\" etc.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 15: U\nTurn 16: U\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\nTurn 19: U\nTurn 20: U\nTurn 21: U\nTurn 22: U\n\nBut note: the last action is at turn22, which is t_1+7 (since 15+7=22). And we have 8 actions.\n\nBut the problem says: the sequence is from t=0 to H-1 (which is 0 to 7) so 8 actions.\n\nSo it matches.\n\nTherefore, we output the above.\n\nBut what if we had to avoid? For example, if we were at row5 at turn23, we would crash. But we are at row5 at turn19, which is safe.\n\nSo we are safe.\n\nTherefore, the answer is the sequence of 8 U's.\n\nBut note: we did BFS and we found a path of 8 moves. We didn't simulate the entire BFS because we found the goal at turn23. \n\nBut if we had to wait, we would have found a longer path. But we found a path of 8 moves.\n\nSo we are done.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 1)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 15\\) is 8.

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t_1 = 16, and the player is at (0,2). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns H, avoiding collisions.\n\nThe grid has freeways at y=1 to 8. Each freeway has cars that move either left or right at a constant speed.\n\nImportant: Collision occurs at turn T only if the player is on a freeway y (from 1 to 8) at that turn, and the car on that freeway has a span that includes 0 at that exact turn.\n\nNote: When the player moves from y to y' at turn T, at the moment of the turn T they are still on the old row y. Then after the action, they move to y' and will be on y' at turn T+1.\n\nSo, to avoid collision at turn T, we must ensure that if the player is on freeway k (where k is the current y at turn T) then no car on freeway k has 0 in its span at turn T.\n\nWe start at (0,2) at turn 16. We can only move up, down, or stay. We need to get to y=9.\n\nThe minimal number of moves without any cars would be 7 moves (only up). But we have to avoid cars on freeways 1 to 8.\n\nWe are at y=2 at turn 16. We need to traverse from y=2 to y=9, which means we must pass through y=3,4,5,6,7,8. However, we might need to wait (by using S or even D) to avoid collisions.\n\nWe are going to simulate the movement and the car positions at each turn.\n\nFirst, note that the cars move continuously. For each car, we have:\n  - For a right-moving car: at turn t, the span is [tau + s*(t - t_1), h + s*(t - t_1)] \n    because at t_1, the car was from tau to h (with tau < h) and it moves right so both endpoints increase by s*(t-t_1).\n  - Similarly, left-moving: [h - s*(t-t_1), tau - s*(t-t_1)] (and note that h and tau are given at t_1, and the car moves left so both endpoints decrease).\n\nBut note: the problem says for left-moving: \n  Span(t_1) = [h, tau] -> Span(T) = [h - s*(T-t_1), tau - s*(T-t_1)]\nHowever, in the table, the cars are given as (head, tail, direction, speed). \n\nObserve the given cars:\n\nFor freeway 1: (48, 25, right, 24) -> at t_1=16, the car is from 25 to 48 (since right: tail=25, head=48? But the problem says for right: \"Span(t_1)=[tau, h]\" meaning [tail, head]? \n\nBut in the table, for freeway 1: (48,25,right,24). Then if it's right-moving, the span at t_1 is [25,48]. Then at time T, the span becomes [25 + 24*(T-16), 48 + 24*(T-16)].\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 5: three cars: \n  (-42, -53, right, 6) -> at t_1: span = [-53, -42]? But wait, the problem says for right: [tau, head]. So if the car is given as (head, tail, ...) then we have to interpret: \n  head = h, tail = tau -> so for right: [tau, h] = [tail, head] = [-53, -42] at t_1.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"head\" and \"tail\". In a right-moving car, the head is the front (rightmost) and tail is the leftmost. So the car occupies [tail, head] at t_1.\n\nSimilarly, left-moving: the head is the front (leftmost) and tail is the rightmost? But the problem says for left: \"Span(t_1)=[h, tau]\" and then it becomes [h - s*(T-t_1), tau - s*(T-t_1)]. \n\nIn the table, we have only right-moving cars? Let me check:\n\nFreeway 1: right\nFreeway 2: right\nFreeway 3: right\nFreeway 4: right\nFreeway 5: three cars, all right\nFreeway 6: three cars, all right\nFreeway 7: right\nFreeway 8: right\n\nSo all cars are right-moving. Therefore, for any car on freeway k, the span at time T (>= t_1) is:\n  [tail + s*(T - 16), head + s*(T - 16)]\n\nWe must avoid having the player at freeway k (at turn T) when 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nNow, we are at turn 16 at y=2. We can choose actions: U, D, S.\n\nOur goal: reach y=9 in minimal H.\n\nWe can try to go up as fast as possible, but we have to check for collisions at each step.\n\nWe need to simulate the player's movement and the car positions at each turn.\n\nLet me denote the turn t (starting at t=16, then 17, 18, ...) and the player's y at the beginning of the turn.\n\nAt turn t, the player is at y_t. Then we choose an action a_t which determines y_{t+1}. Then at turn t, the player is on freeway y_t (if y_t is between 1 and 8) and we check the car on that freeway at turn t.\n\nNote: when we are at y=0 or y=9, there are no cars (since cars are only on freeways 1 to 8). So at y=0 and y=9, we are safe.\n\nWe start at y=2 (freeway 2) at turn 16.\n\nWe need to check for freeway 2 at turn 16: \n  Freeway 2 has one car: (-48, -83, right, 36). \n  So at turn 16: span = [ -83 + 36*(16-16), -48 + 36*(0) ] = [-83, -48]. \n  Does 0 lie in [-83, -48]? -> No, because -48 < 0? Actually -48 is negative and -83 is more negative. So 0 is not in [-83, -48]. So safe.\n\nNow, we can choose an action at turn 16: U, D, or S.\n\nWe want to minimize H, so we prefer U. But we have to check the next state.\n\nLet me try to go up at every step until we hit a problem.\n\nPlan: \n  Turn 16: U -> then at turn 17, y=3.\n  Then we are at freeway 3 at turn 17.\n\nCheck freeway 3 at turn 17:\n  Freeway 3: (-48, -83, right, 36)\n  At turn 17: T - 16 = 1 -> span = [-83 + 36*1, -48 + 36*1] = [-47, -12]. 0 is not in this interval. Safe.\n\nTurn 17: U -> y=4 at turn 18.\n  Freeway 4 at turn 18: same car? \n  Freeway 4: (-48, -83, right, 36) -> at turn 18: T-16=2 -> [-83+72, -48+72] = [-11, 24]. Now 0 is in [-11,24]? Yes, because -11<=0<=24. So collision!\n\nSo we cannot do U at turn 17? Actually, we are at freeway 4 at turn 18? Let me clarify:\n\nAt turn 17: we are at y=3 (because we moved from y=2 at turn 16 to y=3 at turn 17). Then at turn 17, we choose action U -> then at the beginning of turn 18, we are at y=4.\n\nBut the collision check is at the same turn. So at turn 17: we are on freeway 3? Then we check freeway 3 at turn 17: which we did and it was safe.\n\nThen at turn 17, we choose U -> then we move to y=4 at turn 18. Now at turn 18, we are at freeway 4? Then we check freeway 4 at turn 18: which we just computed: [-11,24] includes 0 -> collision.\n\nTherefore, we cannot be at freeway 4 at turn 18.\n\nSo we must avoid being on freeway 4 at turn 18.\n\nWe have two choices at turn 17: \n  Option 1: Instead of U, we can do S -> then at turn 18 we are still at y=3? Then at turn 18, we are on freeway 3? \n      Freeway 3 at turn 18: T=18 -> [-83+36*2, -48+36*2] = [-83+72, -48+72] = [-11,24]. 0 is in there? Yes! So collision.\n\n  Option 2: Do D at turn 17 -> then at turn 18, we are at y=2? Then at turn 18, we are on freeway 2? \n      Freeway 2 at turn 18: T=18 -> [-83+36*2, -48+36*2] = [-11,24]. Again 0 is in [-11,24] -> collision.\n\nSo both S and D at turn 17 lead to collision at turn 18? Then what about turn 16? Maybe we should not go up at turn 16.\n\nAlternatively, we can wait at turn 16: do S at turn 16 -> then at turn 17, we are still at y=2. Then we check freeway 2 at turn 17: \n  T=17: [-83+36, -48+36] = [-47, -12] -> safe.\n\nThen at turn 17, we can do U -> then at turn 18, we are at y=3? Then at turn 18, freeway 3: same as above, [-11,24] -> collision? Because 0 is in that span.\n\nAlternatively, at turn 17 we do S again? Then at turn 18, we are at y=2 -> freeway 2 at turn 18: [-11,24] -> collision.\n\nSo we must avoid being on freeway 2,3,4 at turn 18? \n\nBut note: freeway 5,6,7,8 might also have cars. We are currently stuck at the lower freeways.\n\nWe need to see when the car on freeway 2,3,4 will leave 0.\n\nThe car on freeway 2,3,4 (same car? Actually, no: each freeway has its own cars. But in the state, freeway 2,3,4 each have the same car: (-48,-83,right,36). \n\nSo for freeway 2,3,4: the car at turn T has span: [ -83 + 36*(T-16), -48 + 36*(T-16) ]\n\nWe want 0 not in that interval. So we need:\n  Either 0 < -83 + 36*(T-16)   OR  0 > -48 + 36*(T-16)\n\nSolve:\n  36*(T-16) > 83   -> T-16 > 83/36 ≈ 2.305 -> T-16>=3 -> T>=19\n  or \n  36*(T-16) < 48   -> T-16 < 48/36 = 4/3 ≈ 1.333 -> T-16<=1 -> T<=17\n\nSo for freeway 2,3,4: safe at turn T if T<=17 or T>=19.\n\nAt T=16: we computed [-83,-48] -> safe.\nAt T=17: [-47,-12] -> safe? Actually, 0 is not in [-47,-12] because -12 < 0? Actually, -12 is negative. So 0 is not in the interval. Then why did we get collision at T=18? Because at T=18: [-11,24] -> 0 is in between.\n\nBut at T=17: [-47, -12] -> both negative -> 0 is not in the interval -> safe.\n\nSo actually, freeway 2,3,4 are safe at T=16 and T=17, and then unsafe at T=18? Then becomes safe again at T>=19? \n\nBut at T=19: \n  [ -83 + 36*3, -48+36*3] = [-83+108, -48+108] = [25,60] -> 0 not in [25,60] -> safe.\n\nSo the dangerous turn for freeway 2,3,4 is T=18.\n\nTherefore, we must avoid being on freeway 2,3,4 at turn 18.\n\nBut note: freeway 1 also has a car, but it's different: (48,25,right,24). \n  At T: [25+24*(T-16), 48+24*(T-16)]\n  We need 0 not in that interval.\n  Solve: 24*(T-16) < -48 -> T-16 < -2 -> impossible? \n          or 24*(T-16) > -25 -> T-16 > -25/24 ≈ -1.04 -> always true? \n  Actually, at T=16: [25,48] -> 0 not in.\n  T=17: [25+24=49, 48+24=72] -> 0 not in.\n  So freeway 1 is always safe? \n\nBut we don't need to go to freeway 1? We are starting at 2 and going up.\n\nNow, freeway 5,6,7,8: \n\nFreeway 5: three cars: \n  Car1: (-42, -53, right, 6) -> at T: [-53+6*(T-16), -42+6*(T-16)]\n  Car2: (36,25,right,6) -> [25+6*(T-16), 36+6*(T-16)]\n  Car3: (0,-11,right,6) -> [-11+6*(T-16), 0+6*(T-16)] = [-11+6*(T-16), 6*(T-16)]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6: same three cars.\n\nFreeway 7: (-24,-35,right,12) -> [-35+12*(T-16), -24+12*(T-16)]\n\nFreeway 8: (-48,-59,right,4) -> [-59+4*(T-16), -48+4*(T-16)]\n\nWe need to check when 0 is in the span of any car on the freeway we are on.\n\nWe are currently at turn 16 at y=2. We want to go up.\n\nWe must avoid freeways 2,3,4 at turn 18. So we can be at freeway 2,3,4 at turn 16 and 17, but at turn 18 we must not be there.\n\nHow can we do that?\n\nOption: \n  Turn 16: U -> y=3 at turn 17.\n  Turn 17: we cannot stay at y=3 (because then at turn 18 we are at y=3 and that's freeway 3 -> unsafe) and we cannot go down to y=2 (freeway 2 at turn 18 -> unsafe). So we must go up to y=4? \n      But then at turn 18, we are at freeway 4 -> unsafe.\n\nSo we must avoid being at freeway 2,3,4 at turn 18. \n\nAlternative: \n  At turn 16: we do S -> then at turn 17 we are at y=2 (freeway 2) -> safe (since T=17 is safe for freeway2).\n  Then at turn 17: we do U -> then at turn 18 we are at y=3 -> freeway 3 at turn 18: unsafe.\n\n  Or at turn 17: do D -> then at turn 18: y=1 -> freeway 1 at turn 18: \n        freeway1: at T=18: [25+24*2, 48+24*2] = [25+48,48+48] = [73,96] -> no 0 -> safe? \n        So that's safe.\n\nBut then we are at y=1 at turn 18. Then we can go up from there.\n\nSo plan:\n  Turn 16: S (stay at y=2) -> safe at turn16 (we already are safe at turn16) and then at turn17 we are at y=2 (freeway2) -> safe (T=17: freeway2: [-47,-12] -> safe).\n  Turn 17: D -> move down to y=1 at turn18. Then at turn18 we are at freeway1 -> [73,96] -> safe.\n  Turn 18: U -> then at turn19 we are at y=2. \n        Now at turn19, we are at freeway2 -> freeway2 at T=19: [-83+36*3, -48+36*3] = [25,60] -> safe? \n        Then we can continue.\n\nBut now we are at y=2 at turn19. We want to go up. We have lost time.\n\nAlternatively, after being at y=1 at turn18, we can go up again to y=2 at turn19, then to y=3 at turn20, etc.\n\nBut we need to check the other freeways.\n\nWe also have to check freeway 5,6,7,8 for when we go higher.\n\nBut first, let's see if we can avoid the wait and go up immediately but skip the dangerous turn 18 by being at a safe freeway.\n\nAnother idea: at turn16: U -> to y=3 at turn17 (safe).\n  Then at turn17: we do U again -> then at turn18 we are at y=4 -> freeway4 at turn18: unsafe.\n\n  But what if at turn17 we do two actions? No, one action per turn.\n\nAlternatively, we can go up to y=3 at turn17, then at turn17 we do S? Then at turn18 we are at y=3 -> unsafe.\n\nSo the only safe way at turn18 is to be at freeway1 (y=1) or freeway5+? But we are at y=3 at turn17, we can't jump to y=5.\n\nSo the plan of going down to y=1 at turn18 is one possibility.\n\nBut let's see the minimal turns: we are at y=2 at turn16. \n  Option1: \n      Turn16: U -> y=3 at turn17.\n      Turn17: D -> y=2 at turn18 -> unsafe? because freeway2 at turn18: unsafe. \n      So that doesn't work.\n\n  Option2: \n      Turn16: S -> y=2 at turn17.\n      Turn17: D -> y=1 at turn18 (safe).\n      Turn18: U -> y=2 at turn19 (safe, because freeway2 at turn19: [25,60] -> safe).\n      Turn19: U -> y=3 at turn20 (freeway3 at turn20: same as freeway2? freeway3 car: same parameters -> [ -83+36*(20-16)= -83+144=61, -48+144=96] -> [61,96] -> safe)\n      Turn20: U -> y=4 at turn21 (freeway4: same -> [61,96] -> safe)\n      Turn21: U -> y=5 at turn22 (now freeway5: we have three cars)\n\nBut we are taking 6 moves from turn16 to turn21 (and then we still have to go to y=9). That might not be minimal.\n\nWe lost two turns: we did two moves (S and D) that didn't make progress.\n\nBut we avoided the collision.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to wait at turn16 and turn17, then at turn18 we are at y=2? But that's unsafe. So we had to move down.\n\nAnother idea: can we go up to y=3 at turn17, then at turn17 we go up again? Then we are at y=4 at turn18 -> unsafe.\n\nWhat if we go up twice in a row and then at turn18 we are at y=4, but then we skip freeway4 by going up again at turn18? But we are at freeway4 at turn18 and we check and it is unsafe.\n\nUnless we can be at freeway4 at turn18 and then immediately move to y=5 at turn19? But the collision happens at the turn when we are on freeway4. So we cannot.\n\nSo we must avoid being on freeway2,3,4 at turn18.\n\nBut what about being at freeway5 at turn18? That would require starting at turn16: \n  We are at y=2. \n  Turn16: U -> y=3 at turn17.\n  Turn17: U -> y=4 at turn18 -> unsafe (freeway4 at turn18) -> so we cannot be at y=4 at turn18.\n\nAlternatively, if we could jump from y=2 to y=5 in two moves? But we can only move one step per turn.\n\nSo we must be at y=1, or y=5 or above at turn18? \n\nBut to get to y=5 at turn18 from y=2 at turn16: \n  Turn16: U (y=3)\n  Turn17: U (y=4)\n  Turn18: U (y=5) -> but at turn18 we are at freeway4? No: at the beginning of turn18, we are at y=4 (because we moved from y=4 to y=5 at turn18). Then at turn18, we are at freeway4? Then we check freeway4 at turn18 -> unsafe. \n\nSo we cannot be at freeway4 at turn18 even if we leave it during the same turn? \n\nThe problem says: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} != y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T\". \n\nSo at turn T, you are still on y_T. Then after the action, you move to y_{T+1} and at turn T+1 you are on y_{T+1}.\n\nTherefore, at turn18, if we are at y=4 (because we started turn18 at y=4) and we move to y=5, then at turn18 we are on freeway4 -> we check freeway4 at turn18 -> unsafe. \n\nSo that doesn't work.\n\nTherefore, the only safe freeways at turn18 are freeway1 and freeways 5 and above? But we cannot get to freeway5 at turn18 from y=2 in two moves (only two moves: we can only get to y=4).\n\nSo we must be at freeway1 at turn18.\n\nHow? \n  We start at y=2 at turn16.\n  Turn16: D -> y=1 at turn17. Then at turn17 we are at freeway1 -> check: freeway1 at turn17: [25+24*(17-16), 48+24] = [49,72] -> safe.\n  Then at turn17: we can choose: \n        Option: S -> then at turn18 we are at y=1 -> freeway1 at turn18: [25+24*2,48+48]=[73,96] -> safe.\n        Option: U -> then at turn18 we are at y=2 -> freeway2 at turn18: unsafe -> so we must not do that.\n        Option: D -> but y cannot go below 0 -> so if we try D from y=1, we go to y=0 -> then at turn18 we are at y=0 -> safe (no cars).\n\nSo we can do:\n  Turn16: D -> to y=1 at turn17 (safe at turn17: freeway1 safe).\n  Turn17: D -> to y=0 at turn18 (safe, because y=0 has no cars).\n\nBut then we are at y=0 at turn18. Then we have to go up.\n\nBut then we are at y=0 at turn18, then:\n  Turn18: U -> y=1 at turn19 (freeway1 at turn19: [25+24*3,48+72]=[25+72,48+72]=[97,120] -> safe)\n  Turn19: U -> y=2 at turn20 (freeway2 at turn20: [ -83+36*4, -48+36*4] = [-83+144, -48+144]=[61,96] -> safe)\n  Turn20: U -> y=3 at turn21 (freeway3: same -> [61,96] safe)\n  Turn21: U -> y=4 at turn22 (freeway4: same -> safe)\n  Turn22: U -> y=5 at turn23 (now freeway5: we have to check)\n\nThis is taking even longer.\n\nBut we avoided the dangerous turn18.\n\nNow, compare with the first option that used S and D to go to y=1 at turn18 and then back up. In that option we were at y=2 at turn19. In this one we are at y=0 at turn18 and then y=1 at turn19, y=2 at turn20 -> so we are one step behind.\n\nSo the first option (S at 16, D at 17, then U at 18 to y=2 at turn19) is better: we are at y=2 at turn19.\n\nBut we must check freeway5 and above.\n\nWe are at y=2 at turn19 (from the first option) and then we go up:\n\n  Turn19: U -> y=3 at turn20 -> freeway3 at turn20: [ -83+36*(20-16)= -83+144=61, -48+144=96] -> [61,96] -> safe.\n  Turn20: U -> y=4 at turn21 -> freeway4: same -> safe.\n  Turn21: U -> y=5 at turn22 -> freeway5: we have three cars.\n\nCheck freeway5 at turn22 (T=22, so T-16=6):\n\n  Car1: (-42,-53,right,6) -> [-53+6*6, -42+36] = [-53+36, -42+36] = [-17, -6] -> 0 not in? (both negative) -> safe.\n  Car2: (36,25,right,6) -> [25+36, 36+36] = [61,72] -> safe.\n  Car3: (0,-11,right,6) -> [-11+36, 0+36] = [25,36] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\nSo safe.\n\n  Turn22: U -> y=6 at turn23 -> freeway6: same three cars as freeway5? \n        At turn23: T-16=7\n        Car1: [-53+42, -42+42] = [-11,0] -> wait, 0 is at the endpoint? \n            The span is [tail, head] = [-53+6*7, -42+6*7] = [-53+42, -42+42] = [-11,0]. \n            Is 0 included? Yes, because the interval is closed? The problem says \"if 0 in Span(T)\". \n            Since the car spans include endpoints, and 0 is the head of the car? \n            Actually, the car is defined as (head, tail) and for right-moving: [tail+s*(T-16), head+s*(T-16)]. \n            At turn23: tail+s*(7) = -53+42 = -11, head+s*7 = -42+42=0. \n            So the car spans from -11 to 0. Then 0 is included? Yes. So collision.\n\nTherefore, at turn23, if we are on freeway6, we collide.\n\nSo we must avoid being on freeway6 at turn23.\n\nBut we are at y=6 at turn23? So we are on freeway6 at turn23 -> unsafe.\n\nSo we cannot do U at turn22 to go to y=6 at turn23.\n\nWe must avoid freeway6 at turn23.\n\nWhat are the options at turn22? We are at y=5 at turn22 (safe). Then at turn22 we can choose:\n\n  Option: S -> then at turn23 we are at y=5 -> freeway5 at turn23: \n        Car1: [-53+6*7, -42+42] = [-11,0] -> 0 is in -> collision? \n        But wait, freeway5: car3: (0,-11,right,6) -> at turn23: [-11+42,0+42] = [31,42] -> 0 not in? \n        Actually, freeway5 has three cars. We must check all:\n\n        Car1: [-53+42, -42+42] = [-11,0] -> 0 in -> collision.\n\n        So freeway5 at turn23 is unsafe.\n\n  Option: D -> then at turn23 we are at y=4 -> freeway4: \n        freeway4 car: (-48,-83,right,36) -> at turn23: [ -83+36*7, -48+36*7] = [-83+252, -48+252] = [169,204] -> safe.\n\n  Option: U -> then at turn23 we are at y=6 -> freeway6: same as freeway5 at turn23: unsafe (because car1 on freeway6: same as freeway5 car1: [-11,0] -> collision).\n\nSo only option is to go down to y=4 at turn23? \n\nBut then we are going backward.\n\nAlternatively, we can avoid being at freeway5 and freeway6 at turn23.\n\nLet me see when freeway5 and freeway6 are safe.\n\nFor freeway5 (and similarly freeway6) car1: [-53+6*(T-16), -42+6*(T-16)]\n  We want 0 not in that interval.\n  So either: -53+6*(T-16) > 0  -> 6*(T-16)>53 -> T-16>53/6≈8.83 -> T>=16+9=25\n        or -42+6*(T-16) < 0 -> 6*(T-16)<42 -> T-16<7 -> T<23.\n\nSo safe if T<23 or T>=25.\n\nAt turn22: T=22 -> 22-16=6 -> car1: [-53+36, -42+36] = [-17,-6] -> safe (as we saw).\nAt turn23: T=23 -> 7 -> [-53+42, -42+42] = [-11,0] -> unsafe.\nAt turn24: T=24 -> 8 -> [-53+48, -42+48] = [-5,6] -> 0 in? yes, because -5<=0<=6 -> unsafe.\nAt turn25: T=25 -> 9 -> [-53+54, -42+54] = [1,12] -> safe.\n\nSo freeway5 and freeway6 are unsafe at T=23 and T=24, and safe at T=25.\n\nTherefore, we must avoid being on freeway5 or freeway6 at turns 23 and 24.\n\nNow, we are at turn22: at y=5 (freeway5) at turn22 -> safe. Then we need to leave freeway5 by turn23? But we cannot be at freeway6 at turn23 either.\n\nWhat can we do?\n\nAt turn22 (y=5), we can:\n  - Do D: go to y=4 at turn23 -> freeway4 at turn23: safe (as computed: [169,204] -> safe).\n  - Do S: stay at y=5 -> unsafe at turn23.\n  - Do U: go to y=6 -> unsafe at turn23.\n\nSo only D is safe.\n\nThen we go to y=4 at turn23. Then we are safe.\n\nBut then we are at y=4 at turn23. We need to go up to y=9.\n\nFrom y=4, we can go up. But we have to avoid freeway5 and freeway6 at turn24? \n\nAt turn23: we are at y=4. Then at turn23 we can do:\n  Option: U -> then at turn24 we are at y=5 -> freeway5 at turn24: unsafe (because T=24: car1: [-5,6] -> 0 in).\n  Option: S -> y=4 at turn24 -> freeway4: safe? at turn24: T=24 -> freeway4: [-83+36*8, -48+36*8] = [-83+288, -48+288]=[205,240] -> safe.\n  Option: D -> y=3 at turn24 -> freeway3: same car -> [205,240] -> safe.\n\nBut we want to go up. So we can wait at y=4 for one turn? \n\nThen at turn23: S -> at turn24 we are at y=4 -> safe.\nThen at turn24: U -> then at turn25 we are at y=5 -> freeway5 at turn25: safe (T=25: car1: [1,12] -> no 0).\n\nThen we can continue.\n\nBut we are losing turns.\n\nAlternatively, at turn23 (y=4) we do U? Then at turn24 we are at y=5 -> unsafe.\n\nSo we must wait at turn23.\n\nSo plan from turn22 onwards:\n\n  Turn22: at y=5 (safe) -> do D to go to y=4 at turn23 (safe).\n  Turn23: S (stay at y=4) -> safe at turn24? \n        At turn24: we are at y=4 -> freeway4: safe (as above).\n  Turn24: U -> y=5 at turn25 -> freeway5: safe.\n  Turn25: U -> y=6 at turn26 -> freeway6: at turn26: T=26 -> T-16=10.\n        Check freeway6 car1: [-53+6*10, -42+60] = [-53+60, -42+60] = [7,18] -> safe.\n        Also check the other cars: \n             car2: [25+60,36+60]=[85,96] -> safe.\n             car3: [-11+60,0+60]=[49,60] -> safe.\n        So safe.\n  Then we can go up: \n        Turn26: U -> y=7 at turn27 -> freeway7: one car (-24,-35,right,12) \n              at turn27: T-16=11 -> [-35+12*11, -24+132] = [-35+132, -24+132] = [97,108] -> safe.\n        Turn27: U -> y=8 at turn28 -> freeway8: (-48,-59,right,4) \n              at turn28: T-16=12 -> [-59+4*12, -48+48] = [-59+48, -48+48] = [-11,0] -> 0 is included? \n              So unsafe.\n\nFreeway8 at turn28: car: [-59+48, -48+48] = [-11,0] -> includes 0 -> unsafe.\n\nSo we must avoid freeway8 at turn28.\n\nWe can see when freeway8 is safe:\n  Car: [-59+4*(T-16), -48+4*(T-16)]\n  Safe if: \n        -59+4*(T-16) > 0 -> 4*(T-16)>59 -> T-16>59/4=14.75 -> T>=31\n        or -48+4*(T-16) < 0 -> 4*(T-16)<48 -> T-16<12 -> T<28.\n\nSo safe for T<28 or T>=31.\n\nAt turn28: T=28 -> 12 -> unsafe.\nAt turn27: T=27 -> 11 -> [-59+44, -48+44] = [-15,-4] -> safe.\nAt turn29: T=29 -> 13 -> [-59+52, -48+52] = [-7,4] -> unsafe (0 in).\nAt turn30: T=30 -> 14 -> [-59+56, -48+56] = [-3,8] -> unsafe.\nAt turn31: T=31 -> 15 -> [-59+60, -48+60] = [1,12] -> safe.\n\nSo we must avoid freeway8 at turns 28,29,30.\n\nTherefore, we want to be at freeway8 at turn27 (safe) or turn31 (safe) but not in between.\n\nBut we are at y=7 at turn27 (if we follow the above). Then at turn27 we do U to go to y=8 at turn28 -> unsafe.\n\nSo we must not be at freeway8 at turn28.\n\nWe can:\n  - At turn27 (y=7) we do S -> then at turn28 we are at y=7 -> freeway7: \n        at turn28: T-16=12 -> [-35+12*12, -24+144] = [-35+144, -24+144] = [109,120] -> safe.\n  - Then at turn28: we do S again? Then at turn29: y=7 -> freeway7: T=29: [-35+12*13, -24+156] = [-35+156, -24+156] = [121,132] -> safe.\n  - Then at turn29: S -> turn30: y=7 -> safe.\n  - Then at turn30: U -> then at turn31 we are at y=8 -> freeway8 at turn31: safe (as above).\n\nBut that takes 3 extra turns.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to be at freeway8 at turn31.\n\nHow? We can slow down earlier.\n\nBut we are at y=5 at turn25 (safe). Then:\n  Turn25: U -> y=6 at turn26 (freeway6: safe at turn26 as above).\n  Turn26: U -> y=7 at turn27 (freeway7: safe at turn27: [97,108] -> safe).\n  Then instead of going to y=8 at turn28, we wait at y=7 for three turns? \n        Turn27: S -> turn28: y=7 (safe)\n        Turn28: S -> turn29: y=7 (safe)\n        Turn29: S -> turn30: y=7 (safe)\n        Turn30: U -> turn31: y=8 (safe)\n\nThen from y=8 at turn31, we do U to y=9 at turn32.\n\nBut we are at y=9 at turn32 -> goal.\n\nBut let's count the turns from the start.\n\nWe need to go back to the beginning.\n\nWe had a plan to get to y=5 at turn22, then we did:\n  Turn22: D -> to y=4 at turn23.\n  Turn23: S -> stay at y=4 at turn24.\n  Turn24: U -> to y=5 at turn25.\n  Turn25: U -> to y=6 at turn26.\n  Turn26: U -> to y=7 at turn27.\n  Then we wait at y=7 for turns 27,28,29 -> but wait, at turn27 we are already at y=7? \n        Actually, at turn27 we are at y=7 (from the move at turn26: U from y6 to y7 at turn27). \n        Then at turn27 we do S -> to stay at y=7 at turn28.\n        Turn28: S -> stay at y=7 at turn29.\n        Turn29: S -> stay at y=7 at turn30.\n        Turn30: U -> to y=8 at turn31 (safe).\n        Turn31: U -> to y=9 at turn32.\n\nBut we also have freeway8 at turn31: safe.\n\nNow, what about the starting part? We have to get to y=5 at turn22.\n\nRecall we start at turn16 at y=2.\n\nWe decided to do:\n  Turn16: S -> stay at y=2 at turn17.\n  Turn17: D -> to y=1 at turn18.\n  Turn18: U -> to y=2 at turn19.\n  Turn19: U -> to y=3 at turn20.\n  Turn20: U -> to y=4 at turn21.\n  Turn21: U -> to y=5 at turn22.\n\nSo:\n  Turn16: S\n  Turn17: D\n  Turn18: U\n  Turn19: U\n  Turn20: U\n  Turn21: U -> y=5 at turn22.\n  Then turn22: D -> y=4 at turn23.\n  Turn23: S -> y=4 at turn24.\n  Turn24: U -> y=5 at turn25.\n  Turn25: U -> y=6 at turn26.\n  Turn26: U -> y=7 at turn27.\n  Turn27: S -> y=7 at turn28.\n  Turn28: S -> y=7 at turn29.\n  Turn29: S -> y=7 at turn30.\n  Turn30: U -> y=8 at turn31.\n  Turn31: U -> y=9 at turn32.\n\nTotal turns: from turn16 to turn31: 16 moves? \n  Turns: 16,17,...,31: that's 16 turns? But we take an action at each turn from 16 to 31 (inclusive) -> 16 actions? \n  Actually, the number of actions is from t=16 to t=31: 32-16=16 actions? \n  But we have 16 actions? \n\nBut the goal is to be at y=9 at the beginning of turn t_1+H? \n\nThe player starts at turn t_1 (16) at position (0,2). Then after H actions, at turn t_1+H, the player is at (0,9).\n\nWe take actions at turns: 16,17,...,16+H-1. Then at turn 16+H, the player has moved to the new position? \n\nActually, the state after H actions: \n  After action at turn16: we are at turn17 at y_{17}.\n  ...\n  After action at turn16+H-1: we are at turn16+H at y_{16+H}.\n\nWe want y_{16+H} = 9.\n\nIn our plan, we have actions at turns 16 to 31: that's 16 actions? \n  Turns: 16,17,18,...,31 -> 16 actions? \n  Then the final state is at turn32: y=9.\n\nSo H = 16.\n\nBut is there a faster way?\n\nWe could try to be more efficient.\n\nAlternative at the beginning: instead of going down to y=1, we could go up as much as possible but skip the dangerous turn18 by being at a safe freeway earlier.\n\nBut we saw we cannot be at freeway5 at turn18.\n\nWhat if we wait at y=2 for two turns? \n  Turn16: S -> y=2 at turn17.\n  Turn17: S -> y=2 at turn18 -> unsafe.\n\nNot possible.\n\nWhat if we go up to y=3 at turn17, and then at turn17 we go down to y=2? Then at turn18 we are at y=2 -> unsafe.\n\nOr at turn17 go up to y=4? Then at turn18 we are at y=4 -> unsafe.\n\nSo the only safe way at turn18 is to be at y=0 or y=1.\n\nWe did y=1: but we also considered y=0. \n\nBut y=0 is even lower.\n\nWe also have freeway7 and freeway8 to worry about.\n\nBut in our current plan, we are taking 16 actions. \n\nLet me see if we can avoid the extra waiting at the end for freeway8.\n\nWe are at y=7 at turn27. We want to go to y=8 at a turn when freeway8 is safe. The next safe turn is 31, which is 4 turns away. But we can try to be at y=8 at turn27? \n\nBut we are at y=7 at turn27. To be at y=8 at turn27, we would have had to be at y=7 at turn26 and then do U at turn26? But at turn26 we are at y=6 (from turn25: U from y5 to y6 at turn26). Then at turn26 we do U to y7 at turn27. So we are at y=7 at turn27. We cannot be at y=8 at turn27 without being at y=7 at turn26 and then U at turn26 to y8 at turn27? But that would be two moves in one turn? Not allowed.\n\nSo we are at y=7 at turn27. Then we must wait until turn30 to move to y=8 at turn31? \n\nBut note: we can move to y=8 at turn27? Then we are at freeway8 at turn27: \n  freeway8 at turn27: T=27 -> T-16=11 -> [-59+4*11, -48+44] = [-59+44, -48+44] = [-15,-4] -> safe.\n\nSo at turn27, freeway8 is safe. \n\nThen we can do:\n  At turn26: we are at y=6 (safe at turn26) -> then at turn26 we do U to y=7 at turn27? \n        But then at turn27 we are at freeway7? \n        freeway7 at turn27: [ -35+12*11, -24+132] = [-35+132, -24+132] = [97,108] -> safe.\n        But we want to be at freeway8 at turn27? That would require being at y=8 at turn27, but we are at y=7 at turn27.\n\nSo we cannot.\n\nBut if we had been at y=7 at turn26, then at turn26 we could do U to y=8 at turn27 -> then at turn27 we are at freeway8 -> safe.\n\nSo how to be at y=7 at turn26?\n\nLet me trace back:\n\nWe are at y=5 at turn25 (from turn24: U to y5 at turn25).\n  Then at turn25: we do U to y=6 at turn26 -> so at turn26 we are at y=6.\n\nTo be at y=7 at turn26, we would have to have been at y=6 at turn25 and done U at turn25.\n\nBut at turn25, we are at y=5? \n\nSo we need to be at y=6 at turn25? \n\nThen we must have been at y=5 at turn24 and done U at turn24 to y6 at turn25.\n\nBut at turn24, we are at y=4 (from turn23: D from y5 to y4 at turn23, then turn23: S to stay at y4 at turn24). \n\nSo at turn24: we are at y=4. Then we do U at turn24 to y5 at turn25 -> not y6.\n\nSo we cannot be at y=6 at turn25.\n\nTherefore, we cannot be at y=7 at turn26.\n\nSo the only option is to wait at y=7 until turn30 and then move to y=8 at turn31.\n\nBut is there another way to handle freeway8?\n\nWe could go up to y=8 earlier? \n\nFor example, if we can be at y=8 before turn28? \n\nWe are at y=5 at turn22. Then:\n  Turn22: U -> to y=6 at turn23 -> but freeway6 at turn23: unsafe (car1: [-11,0]).\n  So we cannot.\n\n  Turn22: we did D to y=4 at turn23 -> then we have to wait until turn24 to go back to y=5 at turn25.\n\nSo we are delayed.\n\nBut what if we avoid freeway5 and freeway6 at turn22 and turn23 by being elsewhere? \n\nFor example, at turn21: we are at y=4 (from turn20: U to y4 at turn21). Then at turn21 we can do U to y5 at turn22 -> which we did, and it was safe at turn22. \n\nBut then we are at freeway5 at turn22 and we have to leave by turn23? But we cannot go to freeway6 at turn23 (unsafe) and we cannot stay (unsafe), so we go down to freeway4 at turn23 (safe).\n\nSo no alternative.\n\nTherefore, our plan is as above.\n\nBut we can try to be at freeway8 at an earlier safe time? The safe times are before turn28. \n\nThe next safe time after turn27 is turn31. \n\nWe are at turn27 at y=7. We can go to y=8 at turn27? But we are at y=7 at turn27, so we do U at turn27 to go to y=8 at turn28 -> but turn28 is unsafe.\n\nBut if we could go to y=8 at turn27, we would be safe. But to be at y=8 at turn27, we must have been at y=7 at turn26 and done U at turn26. But we were at y=6 at turn26.\n\nSo not possible.\n\nThus, we must wait until turn31.\n\nNow, total actions: from turn16 to turn31: 16 actions? \n\nTurns: 16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31 -> 16 turns.\n\nH = 16.\n\nBut let me list the actions and the positions:\n\nTurn | Action | y at end of turn (i.e., at next turn) | and then at that next turn, we check the freeway?\nActually, we check at the beginning of the turn.\n\nWe start turn16 at y=2.\n\nAction at turn16: determines y at turn17.\n\nAt turn16: we are at y=2 -> check freeway2: safe.\n\nWe do S: so y at turn17 is still 2.\n\nThen turn17: we are at y=2 -> check freeway2: safe.\n\nWe do D: so y at turn18 = 1.\n\nThen turn18: at y=1 -> check freeway1: safe.\n\nWe do U: so y at turn19 = 2.\n\nTurn19: y=2 -> check freeway2: safe.\n\nWe do U: y20=3.\n\nTurn20: y=3 -> freeway3: safe.\n\nWe do U: y21=4.\n\nTurn21: y=4 -> freeway4: safe.\n\nWe do U: y22=5.\n\nTurn22: y=5 -> freeway5: safe.\n\nWe do D: y23=4.\n\nTurn23: y=4 -> freeway4: safe.\n\nWe do S: y24=4.\n\nTurn24: y=4 -> freeway4: safe.\n\nWe do U: y25=5.\n\nTurn25: y=5 -> freeway5: safe.\n\nWe do U: y26=6.\n\nTurn26: y=6 -> freeway6: safe.\n\nWe do U: y27=7.\n\nTurn27: y=7 -> freeway7: safe.\n\nWe do S: y28=7.\n\nTurn28: y=7 -> freeway7: safe.\n\nWe do S: y29=7.\n\nTurn29: y=7 -> freeway7: safe.\n\nWe do S: y30=7.\n\nTurn30: y=7 -> freeway7: safe.\n\nWe do U: y31=8.\n\nTurn31: y=8 -> freeway8: at T=31, safe.\n\nWe do U: y32=9.\n\nAt turn32, we are at y=9 -> goal.\n\nWe took actions at turns 16 to 31 (16 actions) and reached y=9 at turn32.\n\nSo H=16.\n\nBut we must output the actions from turn16 to turn31.\n\nNow, is there a faster way? \n\nWe can try to minimize the waiting.\n\nNotice that at freeway8, we are waiting 3 turns at y=7. But we could go to y=8 at turn27 if we can, but we can't.\n\nAlternatively, we could go to y=8 earlier by not waiting at y=4 and y=7 as much.\n\nBut we had to wait at y=4 for one turn (turn23: D and then turn24: wait) and then at y=7 for three turns.\n\nTotal waiting: \n  turn16: S (wait)\n  turn17: D (not progress)\n  turn23: D (backward)\n  turn24: S (wait)\n  turn27: S, turn28: S, turn29: S (three waits)\n\nThat's 6 turns that are not upward progress.\n\nThe minimal upward moves: from y=2 to y=9: 7 moves. \nBut we have 16 actions: so 9 extra actions? \n\nBut some of the moves are downward.\n\nWe have two downward moves: turn17: D and turn22: D.\n\nAnd the rest are either up or stay.\n\nTotal upward moves: \n  U at: 18,19,20,21,24,25,26,30,31 -> 9 upward moves? \n  But we only need 7: so we overshot? \n\nWait: we start at y=2. \n  turn16: S -> y=2\n  turn17: D -> y=1\n  turn18: U -> y=2\n  turn19: U -> y=3\n  turn20: U -> y=4\n  turn21: U -> y=5\n  turn22: D -> y=4\n  turn23: S -> y=4\n  turn24: U -> y=5\n  turn25: U -> y=6\n  turn26: U -> y=7\n  turn27: S -> y=7\n  turn28: S -> y=7\n  turn29: S -> y=7\n  turn30: U -> y=8\n  turn31: U -> y=9\n\nSo the net upward moves: from 2 to 9: 7 levels. \nBut we had extra moves: \n  We went down from 2 to 1 (one down) and then up to 2 (so back), then down from 5 to 4 (one down), and then three stays at y=7.\n\nThe total upward moves: \n  from 1 to 2, 2 to 3, 3 to 4, 4 to 5, 4 to 5 (again), 5 to 6, 6 to 7, 7 to 8, 8 to 9: that's 9 upward moves? \nBut we only need 7 because we started at 2. So we did two extra upward moves? \n\nActually, we went from 2 down to 1 (so we had to go back up to 2) and from 5 down to 4 (so we had to go back up to 5). That accounts for two extra upward moves.\n\nAnd then we did three stays at y=7.\n\nSo total moves: 9 up + 2 down + 5 stays = 16 moves.\n\nThe minimal would be 7 up, but we had to do 2 extra up and 2 down and 5 stays? \n\nBut we cannot avoid the down and extra up because of the cars.\n\nPerhaps there is a better path.\n\nAlternative: after turn21 (y=5 at turn22), instead of going down, we go up to y=6 at turn23? \n  But at turn23: freeway6: car1: [-11,0] -> collision.\n\nOr we could wait at y=5 at turn22? Then at turn23: freeway5: unsafe (car1: [-11,0]) -> collision.\n\nSo we must leave freeway5 at turn23. The only safe freeway below is freeway4.\n\nSo we have to go down.\n\nSimilarly, at the beginning, we had to go down to avoid freeway2,3,4 at turn18.\n\nSo I think 16 is the minimal.\n\nBut let me try to optimize the freeway8 part.\n\nWe are at y=7 at turn27. We have to wait until turn31 to go to y=8. But what if we go to y=8 at turn27? We can't because we are at y=7 at turn27.\n\nWhat if we go to y=8 earlier? \n\nFor example, if we can be at y=7 at turn26, then we could go to y=8 at turn27 (safe at freeway8).\n\nHow to be at y=7 at turn26?\n\nWe are at y=5 at turn22. Then:\n  turn22: U -> to y=6 at turn23 -> unsafe at freeway6 (turn23: collision).\n  So we cannot.\n\nBut if we could be at y=5 earlier, then we could go up earlier.\n\nWe are at y=5 at turn22. \n\nHow to be at y=5 earlier?\n\nThe earliest we can be at y=5 is turn21: \n  We start at y=2 at turn16.\n  turn16: U -> y3 at turn17.\n  turn17: U -> y4 at turn18 -> unsafe (freeway4 at turn18: collision) -> not possible.\n\n  turn16: D -> y1 at turn17.\n  turn17: U -> y2 at turn18 -> unsafe (freeway2 at turn18: collision).\n\n  turn16: S -> y2 at turn17.\n  turn17: D -> y1 at turn18 (safe).\n  turn18: U -> y2 at turn19 (safe).\n  turn19: U -> y3 at turn20 (safe).\n  turn20: U -> y4 at turn21 (safe).\n  turn21: U -> y5 at turn22 (safe).\n\nSo we cannot be at y=5 before turn22.\n\nTherefore, we are fixed.\n\nThus, the minimal H is 16.\n\nNow, write the actions:\n\nTurn 16: S\nTurn 17: D\nTurn 18: U\nTurn 19: U\nTurn 20: U\nTurn 21: U\nTurn 22: D\nTurn 23: S\nTurn 24: U\nTurn 25: U\nTurn 26: U\nTurn 27: S\nTurn 28: S\nTurn 29: S\nTurn 30: U\nTurn 31: U\n\nBut wait, at turn31 we do U to get to y=9 at turn32. And we stop at turn31? \n\nThe sequence is for t from 0 to H-1: \n  a_{t_1}, a_{t_1+1}, ..., a_{t_1+H-1}\n\nHere, t_1=16, H=16, so we need actions from turn16 to turn16+15 = turn31.\n\nAnd after 16 actions, at turn32 we are at y=9.\n\nSo the last action is at turn31.\n\nTherefore, the actions are:\n\nTurn 16: S\nTurn 17: D\nTurn 18: U\nTurn 19: U\nTurn 20: U\nTurn 21: U\nTurn 22: D\nTurn 23: S\nTurn 24: U\nTurn 25: U\nTurn 26: U\nTurn 27: S\nTurn 28: S\nTurn 29: S\nTurn 30: U\nTurn 31: U\n\nBut let me verify the final position:\n\nAt turn31: we do U from y8 to y9 -> so at turn32 we are at y9.\n\nAnd we have avoided all collisions.\n\nNow, double-check a few critical turns:\n\nTurn18: we are at y1 (from turn17: D from y2 to y1 at turn18) -> freeway1: [25+24*(18-16),48+24*2]=[25+48,48+48]=[73,96] -> safe.\n\nTurn22: at y5 -> freeway5: \n  car1: [-53+6*(22-16), -42+36] = [-53+36, -42+36] = [-17,-6] -> safe.\n  car2: [25+36,36+36]=[61,72] -> safe.\n  car3: [-11+36,0+36]=[25,36] -> safe.\n\nTurn23: we do D from y5 to y4 -> at turn23 we are at y4: freeway4: [-83+36*(23-16), -48+36*7] = [-83+252, -48+252]=[169,204] -> safe.\n\nTurn24: we do S -> stay at y4: freeway4: same car at turn24: T=24 -> [-83+36*8, -48+288] = [-83+288, 240]=[205,240] -> safe.\n\nTurn25: we do U to y5: freeway5 at turn25: \n  T=25: \n    car1: [-53+6*9, -42+54] = [-53+54, -42+54]=[1,12] -> safe.\n    car2: [25+54,36+54]=[79,90] -> safe.\n    car3: [-11+54,0+54]=[43,54] -> safe.\n\nTurn26: U to y6: freeway6 at turn26: \n    car1: [-53+6*10, -42+60]=[7,18] -> safe.\n    car2: [25+60,36+60]=[85,96] -> safe.\n    car3: [-11+60,0+60]=[49,60] -> safe.\n\nTurn27: U to y7: freeway7 at turn27: \n  [-35+12*11, -24+132] = [-35+132, 108] = [97,108] -> safe.\n\nThen we do S at turn27,28,29: so we stay at y7 for turns28,29,30.\n\nAt turn28: freeway7: T=28: [-35+12*12, -24+144]=[-35+144,120]=[109,120] -> safe.\nAt turn29: T=29: [-35+12*13, -24+156]=[-35+156,132]=[121,132] -> safe.\nAt turn30: T=30: [-35+12*14, -24+168]=[-35+168,144]=[133,144] -> safe.\n\nTurn30: U to y8: then at turn31 we are at y8: freeway8 at turn31: \n  [-59+4*15, -48+60] = [-59+60, 12] = [1,12] -> safe.\n\nTurn31: U to y9: goal.\n\nAll safe.\n\nTherefore, the answer is the sequence above.\n\nBut the problem says: \"determine the minimal number of turns H\", and we have H=16.\n\nBut is there a sequence with H<16? \n\nSuppose we try to reduce the waiting at y=7. \n\nWe must be at freeway8 at a safe turn. The safe turns are <=27 or >=31. \n\nWe are at y=7 at turn27. We can go to y=8 at turn27? Then we would be at freeway8 at turn27: safe. \n\nBut to be at y=8 at turn27, we must have been at y=7 at turn26 and done U at turn26. \n\nBut at turn26, we are at y=6. If we do U at turn26, we go to y=7 at turn27, not y=8.\n\nSo we cannot.\n\nIf we can be at y=7 at turn25, then at turn25: U to y8 at turn26 -> then at turn26 we are at freeway8: \n  freeway8 at turn26: T=26: T-16=10 -> [-59+40, -48+40] = [-19,-8] -> safe.\n\nBut how to be at y=7 at turn25?\n\nWe are at y=5 at turn22. \n  Turn22: U to y6 at turn23 -> unsafe (freeway6 at turn23: car1: [-11,0] -> collision).\n\n  So we cannot.\n\nTherefore, no.\n\nSo the minimal H is 16.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 16: S\nTurn 17: D\nTurn 18: U\nTurn 19: U\nTurn 20: U\nTurn 21: U\nTurn 22: D\nTurn 23: S\nTurn 24: U\nTurn 25: U\nTurn 26: U\nTurn 27: S\nTurn 28: S\nTurn 29: S\nTurn 30: U\nTurn 31: U\n}\n\nNote: The last action is at turn31, and then at turn32 we are at y=9.\n\nThis sequence has 16 actions, so H=16.\n</think>\nTo reach the position (0, 9) from (0, 2) in minimal turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8, the sequence of actions must account for car movements and ensure the player is not on a freeway where a car's span includes 0 at the same turn. The initial turn is \\(t_1 = 16\\), and the player starts at y=2.\n\n### Analysis:\n- **Critical Turns and Freeways**:\n  - Freeways 2, 3, and 4 have a car that makes them unsafe at turn 18 (span includes 0). The player must not be on these freeways at turn 18.\n  - Freeways 5 and 6 are unsafe at turns 23 and 24 (span includes 0).\n  - Freeway 8 is unsafe at turns 28, 29, and 30 (span includes 0).\n- **Strategy**:\n  - Avoid freeways 2, 3, 4 at turn 18 by moving to y=1 (freeway 1 is safe at turn 18).\n  - Handle freeways 5 and 6 by moving down to y=4 at turn 23 (safe) and waiting until turn 25 to move back up (freeway 5 safe at turn 25).\n  - For freeway 8, wait at y=7 (safe) until turn 30, then move to y=8 at turn 31 (safe), and finally to y=9.\n\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 16, with the sequence starting at turn 16 and ending at turn 31. After the last action at turn 31, the player reaches y=9 at turn 32.\n\n### Action Sequence:\n- **Turn 16 (y=2)**: Stay (S) to remain at y=2 (safe, freeway 2 safe at turn 16).\n- **Turn 17 (y=2)**: Down (D) to move to y=1 (safe, freeway 2 safe at turn 17).\n- **Turn 18 (y=1)**: Up (U) to move to y=2 (safe, freeway 1 safe at turn 18).\n- **Turn 19 (y=2)**: Up (U) to move to y=3 (safe, freeway 2 safe at turn 19).\n- **Turn 20 (y=3)**: Up (U) to move to y=4 (safe, freeway 3 safe at turn 20).\n- **Turn 21 (y=4)**: Up (U) to move to y=5 (safe, freeway 4 safe at turn 21).\n- **Turn 22 (y=5)**: Down (D) to move to y=4 (safe, freeway 5 safe at turn 22; avoid unsafe freeway 5 at turn 23).\n- **Turn 23 (y=4)**: Stay (S) to remain at y=4 (safe, freeway 4 safe at turn 23).\n- **Turn 24 (y=4)**: Up (U) to move to y=5 (safe, freeway 4 safe at turn 24; freeway 5 safe at turn 25).\n- **Turn 25 (y=5)**: Up (U) to move to y=6 (safe, freeway 5 safe at turn 25).\n- **Turn 26 (y=6)**: Up (U) to move to y=7 (safe, freeway 6 safe at turn 26).\n- **Turn 27 (y=7)**: Stay (S) to remain at y=7 (safe, freeway 7 safe at turn 27; avoid unsafe freeway 8 at turn 28).\n- **Turn 28 (y=7)**: Stay (S) to remain at y=7 (safe, freeway 7 safe at turn 28).\n- **Turn 29 (y=7)**: Stay (S) to remain at y=7 (safe, freeway 7 safe at turn 29).\n- **Turn 30 (y=7)**: Up (U) to move to y=8 (safe, freeway 7 safe at turn 30; freeway 8 safe at turn 31).\n- **Turn 31 (y=8)**: Up (U) to move to y=9 (reached goal at turn 32).\n\nThis sequence ensures no collisions and reaches y=9 in minimal turns (H=16).\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 16: S\nTurn 17: D\nTurn 18: U\nTurn 19: U\nTurn 20: U\nTurn 21: U\nTurn 22: D\nTurn 23: S\nTurn 24: U\nTurn 25: U\nTurn 26: U\nTurn 27: S\nTurn 28: S\nTurn 29: S\nTurn 30: U\nTurn 31: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,2) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t₁ = 17.\n\nFirst, I should understand how the cars move. All cars are moving right, according to the table. For right-moving cars, the span at time T is [τ + s(T - t₁), h + s(T - t₁)], since it's moving right.\n\nThe collision happens only if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T, and 0 is in the span of some car on that freeway at that turn.\n\nThe player starts at y=2 at turn t₁=17. I need to reach y=9.\n\nThe vertical moves: U increases y by 1, D decreases by 1, S stays. y is between 0 and 9, so I can't go below 0 or above 9.\n\nSince I need to go up from 2 to 9, that's 7 steps up, but I might need to stay or go down to avoid cars, so H could be more than 7.\n\nBut I want minimal H, so I should try to go up as much as possible, avoiding collisions.\n\nNow, let's look at each freeway and when cars are at x=0.\n\nFor a car on freeway k, at turn T, the span is [τ + s(T - t₁), h + s(T - t₁)] for right-moving.\n\nCollision if 0 is in [τ + s(T - t₁), h + s(T - t₁)].\n\nSince the car is moving right, the span shifts right with speed s.\n\n0 is in the span if τ + s(T - t₁) ≤ 0 ≤ h + s(T - t₁).\n\nBut since for right-moving, h > τ, I think, because head is greater than tail? Let me confirm.\n\nIn the car update: for right-moving, span at t₁ is [τ, h], so h is head, which should be greater than τ, tail. So [τ, h] with τ < h, I assume.\n\nSimilarly for left, but all are right here.\n\nIn the table, for freeway 1: (72,49,right,24) — head 72, tail 49? But 72 > 49, so [49,72] I think? But it says head h, tail τ, so for right, it should be tail left, head right, so span [τ, h] with τ < h.\n\nBut here for freeway 1: h=72, τ=49, so [49,72].\n\nThen at time T, span [τ + s(T-t₁), h + s(T-t₁)] = [49 + 24(T-17), 72 + 24(T-17)]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, collision when player is on y=k at turn T, and 0 in the span for that car on k.\n\nSince multiple cars per freeway, I need to check all cars on that row.\n\nNow, freeway 5 and 6 have multiple cars.\n\nFreeway 5: three cars: (-36,-47,right,6), (42,31,right,6), (6,-5,right,6) all with speed 6.\n\nSimilarly freeway 6 same cars? No, freeway 6 has same: (-36,-47,right,6), (42,31,right,6), (6,-5,right,6)\n\nBut different freeways, so I need to handle separately.\n\nFreeway 7: (-12,-23,right,12)\n\nFreeway 8: (-44,-55,right,4)\n\nFreeway 1: (72,49,right,24)\n\nFreeway 2: (-12,-47,right,36) — head -12, tail -47? -12 > -47, so tail τ=-47, head h=-12, so span [-47,-12] at t₁.\n\nThen moving right.\n\nSimilarly freeway 3 and 4 same as 2? Freeway 2,3,4 all have (-12,-47,right,36)\n\nLet's list all:\n\nFreeway 1: car: h=72, τ=49, s=24, direction right → span at t₁: [49,72]\n\nAt T: [49 + 24(T-17), 72 + 24(T-17)]\n\nFreeway 2: h=-12, τ=-47, s=36, right → span at t₁: [-47,-12]\n\nAt T: [-47 + 36(T-17), -12 + 36(T-17)]\n\nSimilarly freeway 3: same as freeway 2? The table says for freeway 3: (-12,-47,right,36) so same as freeway 2.\n\nFreeway 4: same.\n\nFreeway 5: three cars:\n\nCar1: h=-36? No, (-36,-47,right,6) so τ=-47, h=-36? -36 > -47, so span [-47,-36] at t₁? Head and tail.\n\nIn the tuple: (head, tail, dir, speed)\n\nFor car on freeway 5: first car: head=-36? But it says (-36,-47,right,6), so head h=-36, tail τ=-47.\n\nSince right-moving, and h=-36, τ=-47, since -36 > -47, so the head is at -36, tail at -47, so the car spans from -47 to -36, so [τ, h] = [-47, -36]\n\nSimilarly, second car: (42,31,right,6) → τ=31, h=42, span [31,42]\n\nThird car: (6,-5,right,6) → τ=-5, h=6, span [-5,6]\n\nAll at t₁=17.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 6: same three cars: (-36,-47,right,6), (42,31,right,6), (6,-5,right,6) so identical to freeway 5? But different freeway, so same car positions but on different rows.\n\nFreeway 7: (-12,-23,right,12) → τ=-23, h=-12, span [-23,-12] at t₁\n\nFreeway 8: (-44,-55,right,4) → τ=-55, h=-44, span [-55,-44] at t₁\n\nNow, the player starts at y=2 at turn t=17.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars, but y=9 is the goal.\n\nNow, to reach (0,9), I need to be at y=9 at some turn T, and at that turn, since y=9 has no freeway? Freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 should be safe, no cars.\n\nThe grid has y=0 to 9, freeways on y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, so no cars, so safe to be there.\n\nBut when moving, if I go to y=9, at turn T, I need to ensure that at that turn, I don't collide, but since no cars on y=9, it should be fine.\n\nSimilarly for y=0.\n\nNow, the key point is when I am on a freeway y=1 to 8 at some turn, I need to avoid the cars at x=0 at that turn.\n\nSince I am always at x=0, I think, the player position is (0, y_t), so x=0 always.\n\nSo collision if at turn T, y_T = k for some k=1 to 8, and 0 is in the span of some car on freeway k at that turn T.\n\nNow, for each freeway and each turn, I can find if x=0 is occupied.\n\nBut turns are discrete, so I can compute for each k and each relative time t = T - t₁, when 0 is in the span.\n\nSet t_rel = T - t₁, so t_rel=0 is current turn.\n\nAt t_rel, for a car, span is [τ + s * t_rel, h + s * t_rel] for right-moving.\n\n0 in span if τ + s t_rel ≤ 0 ≤ h + s t_rel\n\nWhich is equivalent to:\n\nLower bound: τ + s t_rel ≤ 0 ⇒ t_rel ≤ -τ / s ? Let's solve inequalities.\n\nτ + s t_rel ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ h + s t_rel\n\nSo s t_rel ≤ -τ and -s t_rel ≤ h? Better:\n\nFrom τ + s t_rel ≤ 0 ⇒ s t_rel ≤ -τ ⇒ t_rel ≤ ceil(-τ / s) or something? Since t_rel integer.\n\nSimilarly, 0 ≤ h + s t_rel ⇒ s t_rel ≥ -h ⇒ t_rel ≥ ceil(-h / s) ? Let's be careful.\n\nInequality: τ + s t_rel ≤ 0 ≤ h + s t_rel\n\nSo:\n\nLeft: τ + s t_rel ≤ 0 ⇒ s t_rel ≤ -τ\n\nSince s > 0, t_rel ≤ floor( (-τ) / s ) ? Because t_rel integer.\n\nSet A = τ + s t_rel ≤ 0\n\nB = 0 ≤ h + s t_rel\n\nA: τ + s t_rel ≤ 0 ⇒ s t_rel ≤ -τ ⇒ t_rel ≤ floor( (-τ) / s ) because t_rel integer, and s t_rel decreases as t_rel decreases.\n\nFor example, s t_rel ≤ -τ, so t_rel ≤ floor( -τ / s )\n\nSimilarly, B: 0 ≤ h + s t_rel ⇒ s t_rel ≥ -h ⇒ t_rel ≥ ceil( (-h) / s ) ? Let's see.\n\ns t_rel ≥ -h, since s>0, t_rel ≥ ceil( -h / s ) because t_rel integer.\n\nFor instance, if -h / s = 2.3, then t_rel >= 3 to have s t_rel >= -h.\n\nSimilarly, for A, t_rel <= floor( (-τ)/s )\n\nThen 0 in span when ceil( -h / s ) <= t_rel <= floor( (-τ)/s )\n\nBut let's write with the car parameters.\n\nDefine for each car, the times when it occupies x=0.\n\nFor a car with tail τ, head h, speed s, right-moving.\n\n0 in [τ + s t_rel, h + s t_rel] when:\n\nτ + s t_rel <= 0 and 0 <= h + s t_rel\n\nSo:\n\ns t_rel <= -τ  (1)\n\nand -s t_rel <= h   (2) which is s t_rel >= -h  (since multiply both sides by -1, inequality flips)\n\nFrom (2): 0 <= h + s t_rel ⇒ s t_rel >= -h\n\nFrom (1): s t_rel <= -τ\n\nSo t_rel must satisfy: ceil( -h / s ) <= t_rel <= floor( (-τ) / s )\n\nBecause t_rel integer.\n\nNow, since the span is [τ + s t_rel, h + s t_rel], and τ < h, so -h < -τ, so ceil(-h/s) <= floor(-τ/s) might not hold, but only if the car covers x=0 at some point.\n\nIf ceil(-h/s) <= floor(-τ/s), then for t_rel in that range, occupied.\n\nOtherwise, not occupied.\n\nNow let's compute for each freeway.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: k=1, car: τ=49, h=72, s=24\n\n- h = -72, -τ = -49\n\ns=24\n\nceil( -h / s ) = ceil( 72 / 24 ) = ceil(3) =3\n\nfloor( (-τ)/s ) = floor(49/24) = floor(2.041) =2\n\nceil(72/24)=3, floor(49/24)=2\n\n3 <= t_rel <= 2? 3>2, impossible, so never occupied? But let's see.\n\nt_rel >= ceil(72/24) = ceil(3) =3\n\nt_rel <= floor(49/24) = floor(2.041) =2\n\n3 <= t_rel <=2, which is impossible, so no collision at x=0 for freeway 1 at any time. Because the car is at [49,72] at t_rel=0, moving right, so it will never reach x=0 since it starts at x=49 and increases. Similarly, -τ = -49, -h=-72, so t_rel <= floor(-49/24) wait no.\n\nFrom above: t_rel <= floor( (-τ)/s ) = floor( (-49)/24? (-τ) = -τ, but τ=49, so -τ = -49.\n\nThen floor( (-τ)/s ) = floor( -49 / 24 ) = floor( -2.041 ) = -3? Because -2.041, floor is -3 since floor is greatest integer less than or equal.\n\nI think I messed up the signs.\n\nLet me start over.\n\nτ + s t_rel <= 0\n\nτ=49, s=24, so 49 + 24 t_rel <=0\n\n24 t_rel <= -49\n\nt_rel <= -49/24 = -2.04166...\n\nSince t_rel integer, t_rel <= -3? Because at t_rel = -3, 24*(-3) = -72, 49 -72 = -23 <=0\n\nAt t_rel = -2, 24*(-2)= -48, 49-48=1 >0, not <=0\n\nSo for inequality τ + s t_rel <=0, it holds when t_rel <= floor( -τ / s ) = floor( -49/24 ) = floor(-2.041) = -3\n\nSimilarly, 0 <= h + s t_rel, h=72, s=24\n\n72 + 24 t_rel >=0\n\n24 t_rel >= -72\n\nt_rel >= -72/24 = -3\n\nt_rel >= -3\n\nSo both: τ + s t_rel <=0 when t_rel <= -3\n\n0 <= h + s t_rel when t_rel >= -3\n\nSo at t_rel = -3, it holds: τ + s(-3) =49 -72= -23 <=0, and h + s(-3)=72-72=0 <=0? 0 <=0 is true.\n\nAt t_rel=-3, 0 is included.\n\nFor other t_rel, not both true.\n\nBut t_rel = T - t₁, and T is current or future, so t_rel >=0 for future turns.\n\nt_rel >=0, since we start at t_rel=0.\n\nAt t_rel=0, for freeway 1, τ + s*0 =49 >0, so not <=0, so no collision.\n\nFor t_rel>0, τ + s t_rel >49>0, so not <=0, so never occupied at x=0 for t_rel>=0.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: τ=-47, h=-12, s=36\n\nThen τ + s t_rel <=0: -47 + 36 t_rel <=0\n\n36 t_rel <=47\n\nt_rel <= 47/36 ≈1.305, so t_rel <=1\n\nSince t_rel integer, t_rel <=1\n\nAnd 0 <= h + s t_rel: 0 <= -12 + 36 t_rel\n\n36 t_rel >=12\n\nt_rel >= 12/36 = 1/3, so t_rel >=1\n\nThus at t_rel=1, both: -47 +36*1 = -11 <=0, and -12 +36*1=24>=0? 0 <=24 true.\n\nSo occupied at t_rel=1.\n\nFor other t_rel, not both.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3 and 4 same as freeway 2, since same car parameters.\n\nFreeway 3: (-12,-47,right,36) same as freeway 2.\n\nFreeway 4 same.\n\nNow freeway 5: three cars.\n\nFirst car: τ=-47, h=-36, s=6\n\nThen τ + s t_rel <=0: -47 +6 t_rel <=0\n\n6 t_rel <=47\n\nt_rel <= 47/6 ≈7.833, so t_rel <=7\n\n0 <= h + s t_rel: 0 <= -36 +6 t_rel\n\n6 t_rel >=36\n\nt_rel >=6\n\nSo occupied when 6 <= t_rel <=7\n\nAt t_rel=6: -47+36= -11 <=0, -36+36=0 <=0? 0<=0 true.\n\nAt t_rel=7: -47+42= -5 <=0, -36+42=6>=0 true.\n\nSecond car on freeway 5: τ=31, h=42, s=6\n\nτ + s t_rel <=0: 31 +6 t_rel <=0? 31 +6t_rel <=0, 6t_rel <= -31, t_rel <= -31/6 ≈ -5.166, so t_rel <= -6\n\nBut t_rel >=0, so never <=0, so no collision for this car.\n\nSimilarly, third car: τ=-5, h=6, s=6\n\nτ + s t_rel <=0: -5 +6 t_rel <=0\n\n6 t_rel <=5\n\nt_rel <= 5/6 ≈0.833, so t_rel <=0\n\n0 <= h + s t_rel: 0 <=6 +6 t_rel, which is always true for t_rel >=0 since 6+6t_rel >=6>0.\n\nSo only need τ + s t_rel <=0: -5 +6 t_rel <=0 for t_rel <=0\n\nAt t_rel=0, -5+0= -5 <=0 true, so occupied at t_rel=0.\n\nAt t_rel=0, τ + s*0 = -5 <=0, and 0 <=6+0=6 true.\n\nFor t_rel>0, -5 +6t_rel >0 when t_rel>=1, so not <=0, so not occupied.\n\nSo for freeway 5, at t_rel=0, occupied by third car? t_rel=0 is current turn.\n\nBut player is at y=2 at t_rel=0, not on freeway 5, freeway 5 is y=5.\n\nFreeways are k=1 to 8, corresponding to y=1 to y=8.\n\nPlayer at y=2, freeway 2.\n\nNow for freeway 5, at t_rel=0, the third car occupies x=0?

Freeway 6 has same three cars, so identical occupation times: at t_rel=0,6,7 occupied.\n\nt_rel=0 for car 3, etc.\n\nNow freeway 7: τ=-23, h=-12, s=12\n\nτ + s t_rel <=0: -23 +12 t_rel <=0\n\n12 t_rel <=23\n\nt_rel <= 23/12 ≈1.916, so t_rel <=1\n\n0 <= h + s t_rel: 0 <= -12 +12 t_rel\n\n12 t_rel >=12\n\nt_rel >=1\n\nThus at t_rel=1, occupied.\n\nFreeway 8: τ=-55, h=-44, s=4\n\nτ + s t_rel <=0: -55 +4 t_rel <=0\n\n4 t_rel <=55\n\nt_rel <= 55/4 = 13.75, so t_rel <=13\n\n0 <= h + s t_rel: 0 <= -44 +4 t_rel\n\n4 t_rel >=44\n\nt_rel >=11\n\nSo occupied when 11 <= t_rel <=13\n\nAt t_rel=11: -55+44= -11 <=0, -44+44=0 <=0 true.\n\nt_rel=12: -55+48= -7 <=0, -44+48=4>=0 true.\n\nt_rel=13: -55+52= -3 <=0, -44+52=8>=0 true.\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway, times when x=0 is occupied (for t_rel >=0):\n\n- y=1: never occupied\n\n- y=2: at t_rel=1 (since freeway 2 occupied at t_rel=1)\n\n- y=3: same as y=2, occupied at t_rel=1\n\n- y=4: same, occupied at t_rel=1\n\n- y=5: occupied at t_rel=0 (by car3), t_rel=6, t_rel=7 (by car1)\n\n- y=6: same as y=5, occupied at t_rel=0,6,7\n\n- y=7: occupied at t_rel=1\n\n- y=8: occupied at t_rel=11,12,13\n\nt_rel=0 is current turn.\n\nPlayer starts at y=2 at t_rel=0.\n\nAt t_rel=0, y=2 is freeway, but is it occupied?\n\nFor y=2, freeway 2, at t_rel=0, let's check.\n\nFreeway 2: at t_rel=0, span [-47,-12], which is all negative, so 0 not in [-47,-12], since -12 <0? -12 is less than 0, so [-47,-12] all x<0, so 0 not in span, so not occupied at t_rel=0.\n\nFrom earlier, for y=2, occupied only at t_rel=1.\n\nSimilarly, y=5 occupied at t_rel=0,6,7.\n\nNow, player at t_rel=0, y=2, not occupied, safe.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\ny=9 has no freeway, so safe whenever.\n\nBut I need to be on y=9 at some turn.\n\nThe minimal H might be 7, if I go up every turn, but I need to avoid collisions.\n\nStart at y=2, t_rel=0.\n\nAction sequence: each turn, choose U, D, or S.\n\ny_{t+1} = y_t + delta, with delta +1 for U, -1 for D, 0 for S.\n\ny in [0,9].\n\nGoal: from y=2 to y=9, difference 7, so at least 7 U actions.\n\nBut with S or D, H increases.\n\nMinimal H is at least 7.\n\nCan I achieve H=7?\n\nThat means moving up every turn for 7 turns.\n\nSequence of positions: at turn t_rel, y position.\n\nt_rel=0: y=2\n\nt_rel=1: y=3 (after U)\n\nt_rel=2: y=4\n\nt_rel=3: y=5\n\nt_rel=4: y=6\n\nt_rel=5: y=7\n\nt_rel=6: y=8\n\nt_rel=7: y=9\n\nNow, check for each turn if collision.\n\nAt each turn T (t_rel), when on freeway, check if occupied.\n\nt_rel=0: y=2, freeway 2, occupied? At t_rel=0, for y=2: as above, not occupied, safe.\n\nt_rel=1: y=3, freeway 3, occupied at t_rel=1? Yes, from above, y=3 occupied at t_rel=1. Collision!\n\nProblem.\n\nSo if I go directly up, at t_rel=1, y=3, which is occupied, collision.\n\nCannot go directly up in 7 turns.\n\nNeed to delay or something.\n\nPerhaps go down first or stay to avoid.\n\nBut going down might not help.\n\nSince y=1 is never occupied, I could go to y=1 first.\n\nOr stay at y=2 for some turns.\n\nBut y=2 is safe only at t_rel=0, but at t_rel=1 it is occupied? y=2 at t_rel=1.\n\ny=2 is freeway, occupied at t_rel=1, as above.\n\nAt t_rel=0, y=2 safe.\n\nAt t_rel=1, if I am on y=2, it would be occupied, but in the sequence, at t_rel=1, I might not be on y=2.\n\nIn the path above, at t_rel=1, I am on y=3, which is occupied.\n\nBut y=2 at t_rel=1 is also occupied.\n\ny=1 is never occupied.\n\ny=4 occupied only at t_rel=1, same as y=2 and y=3.\n\ny=4 also occupied at t_rel=1.\n\nFreeways 2,3,4 all occupied at t_rel=1 only.\n\ny=1 never.\n\ny=5 occupied at t_rel=0,6,7\n\ny=6 same.\n\ny=7 occupied at t_rel=1\n\ny=8 occupied at t_rel=11,12,13 — but that's later, might not reach.\n\nFor minimal path, I need to avoid being on y=3 at t_rel=1, or y=4 at t_rel=1, etc.\n\nSince y=1 is always safe, I could go to y=1 at some point.\n\nStart at t_rel=0, y=2 safe.\n\nI need to be not on y=2,3,4 at t_rel=1, because all are occupied at t_rel=1.\n\ny=2,3,4 all occupied at t_rel=1.\n\ny=1 is safe, y=5 is occupied at t_rel=0 but not at t_rel=1? y=5 occupied at t_rel=0,6,7.\n\nAt t_rel=1, y=5 not occupied, since only t_rel=0,6,7.\n\nSimilarly, y=6 not occupied at t_rel=1.\n\ny=7 occupied at t_rel=1.\n\ny=8 not occupied until t_rel=11.\n\nSo at t_rel=1, which y are safe?\n\ny=1: safe, never occupied\n\ny=2: occupied\n\ny=3: occupied\n\ny=4: occupied\n\ny=5: not occupied (only 0,6,7)\n\ny=6: not occupied (only 0,6,7, but t_rel=1 not in)\n\ny=7: occupied at t_rel=1\n\ny=8: not occupied\n\ny=0 and y=9 safe but not freeways, but when on them, no collision.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are not freeways, so no cars, safe.\n\nAt t_rel=1, safe positions: y=0,1,5,6,8,9? y=8 not occupied, y=5,6 not occupied, y=1 safe, y=0 safe.\n\ny=7 occupied, y=2,3,4 occupied.\n\nSo I can be at y=1,5,6,8 or 0 or 9 at t_rel=1.\n\nBut I start from y=2 at t_rel=0.\n\nAt t_rel=0, I choose action for turn t₁, which affects y at t_rel=1.\n\nAction at turn t: affects y_{t+1}, I think.\n\nGame dynamics: at turn t, player is at position, then chooses action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nFrom: y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t, where Delta depends on a_t.\n\nAnd at turn T, if on freeway, collision if car at x=0.\n\nNow, at turn T, when we compute collision, it is based on the position y_T at that turn.\n\nFor example, at turn t_rel=0, position y=2, we are on freeway 2, and since not occupied, safe.\n\nThen we choose action a_t for turn t (which is t_rel=0), to go to y_{t+1} at t_rel=1.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nTo avoid collision at t_rel=1, I need that at t_rel=1, I am not on a occupied freeway.\n\nSo for t_rel=1, occupied freeways: y=2,3,4,7\n\nSafe: y=1,5,6,8 and y=0,9\n\nNow from y=2 at t_rel=0, possible actions:\n\n- U: to y=3 at t_rel=1\n\n- D: to y=1 at t_rel=1\n\n- S: to y=2 at t_rel=1\n\nBut if I go to y=3 or y=2 at t_rel=1, it is occupied, collision.\n\nIf I go to y=1, safe.\n\nSo only possible from start is to go down to y=1 at t_rel=1.\n\nAction at turn t₁ (t_rel=0): D, to y=1.\n\nThen at t_rel=1, y=1, which is safe.\n\nNow from there, I need to reach y=9.\n\ny=1 at t_rel=1.\n\nNow at t_rel=1, I choose action for next.\n\nI need to go up.\n\nBut I have to avoid future collisions.\n\nFor example, at t_rel=1, y=1 safe.\n\nNow I can go U to y=2, or S stay, or D to y=0.\n\nBut y=0 safe, but going down might not help.\n\nGo to y=2 at t_rel=2.\n\nNow, at t_rel=2, what is occupied?\n\nWe need to check for each freeway at t_rel=2.\n\nFirst, y=2: freeway 2, occupied only at t_rel=1, not at t_rel=2. Because for y=2, only t_rel=1 occupied.\n\nSimilarly, y=3: only t_rel=1\n\ny=4: only t_rel=1\n\ny=5: occupied at t_rel=0,6,7; t_rel=2 not occupied\n\ny=6: same\n\ny=7: occupied at t_rel=1, not at t_rel=2? For y=7, freeway 7, occupied at t_rel=1 only, as above.\n\ny=8: occupied at t_rel=11,12,13, not now.\n\nAt t_rel=2, all freeways are safe, since:\n\ny=2: not occ (only t_rel=1)\n\ny=3: not occ\n\ny=4: not occ\n\ny=5: not occ (occ at 0,6,7)\n\ny=6: not occ\n\ny=7: not occ (occ at t_rel=1)\n\ny=8: not occ\n\nSo at t_rel=2, any y is safe.\n\nSimilarly, for later turns.\n\nBut I need to be careful when I reach y=5 or y=6 around t_rel=6 or 7.\n\nNow from t_rel=1, y=1.\n\nI can go U to y=2 at t_rel=2.\n\nAt t_rel=2, y=2, safe, as above.\n\nThen from y=2 at t_rel=2, I can go U to y=3 at t_rel=3.\n\nAt t_rel=3, y=3: is it occupied? y=3 occupied only at t_rel=1, not at t_rel=3, safe.\n\nThen U to y=4 at t_rel=4, safe.\n\nThen U to y=5 at t_rel=5.\n\nNow at t_rel=5, y=5.\n\ny=5 occupied at t_rel=0,6,7; not at t_rel=5, so safe.\n\nThen from y=5 at t_rel=5, if I go U to y=6 at t_rel=6.\n\nAt t_rel=6, y=6: occupied? y=6 occupied at t_rel=0,6,7? Yes, at t_rel=6, occupied.\n\nCollision.\n\nProblem.\n\nAt t_rel=6, if I am on y=6, it is occupied.\n\nSimilarly, if I go to y=5 at t_rel=6, also occupied.\n\ny=5 occupied at t_rel=6.\n\nBut at t_rel=5, I am on y=5, which is safe, but at t_rel=6 I need to move.\n\nFrom y=5 at t_rel=5, actions:\n\n- U to y=6 at t_rel=6\n\n- S to y=5 at t_rel=6\n\n- D to y=4 at t_rel=6\n\nBut at t_rel=6, y=5 and y=6 are both occupied.\n\ny=4 at t_rel=6: is it occupied? y=4 occupied only at t_rel=1, not at t_rel=6, so safe.\n\nBut going down to y=4.\n\nThen I need to go up later.\n\nSimilarly, y=7 at t_rel=6: not occupied, since y=7 occupied only at t_rel=1.\n\ny=8 not occupied.\n\nSo options at t_rel=5, y=5:\n\nIf I go U to y=6 at t_rel=6, collision.\n\nIf I go S to y=5 at t_rel=6, collision.\n\nIf I go D to y=4 at t_rel=6, safe.\n\nThen from there, I can go up.\n\nBut it might take more turns.\n\nSince at t_rel=6 and 7, y=5 and y=6 are occupied, I need to avoid being on them at those times.\n\nSimilarly for y=6.\n\nNow, back to the path.\n\nI was at t_rel=1, y=1.\n\nInstead of going directly up, I could go to other places.\n\nBut let's see the times.\n\nI need to be at y=9 eventually.\n\nThe dangerous times are t_rel=6 and 7 for y=5 and y=6.\n\nAlso, earlier at t_rel=1 for y=2,3,4,7 but I avoided that.\n\nNow from t_rel=1, y=1.\n\nI go U to y=2 at t_rel=2. Safe.\n\nThen U to y=3 at t_rel=3. Safe.\n\nU to y=4 at t_rel=4. Safe.\n\nNow at t_rel=4, y=4.\n\nI need to go to y=5 or something.\n\nBut if I go U to y=5 at t_rel=5. Safe, as above.\n\nThen at t_rel=5, y=5, I cannot go to y=6 or stay at t_rel=6.\n\nSo I must go down to y=4 at t_rel=6.\n\nAction at t_rel=5 (which is turn t₁+5), I choose D, to go to y=4 at t_rel=6.\n\nAt t_rel=6, y=4, which is safe, since y=4 not occupied at t_rel=6.\n\nThen from there, I can go up again.\n\nBut at t_rel=6, y=4, I can go U to y=5 at t_rel=7.\n\nBut at t_rel=7, y=5 is occupied! Because y=5 occupied at t_rel=7.\n\nt_rel=7, occupied.\n\nSimilarly, if I go to y=6 at t_rel=7, also occupied.\n\ny=5 and y=6 both occupied at t_rel=7.\n\nSo from y=4 at t_rel=6, if I go U to y=5 at t_rel=7, collision.\n\nIf I go S to y=4 at t_rel=7, safe, but not progress.\n\nIf I go D to y=3 at t_rel=7, safe.\n\nBut I need to go up.\n\nPerhaps I should stay at y=4 for multiple turns or something.\n\nBut let's list the positions.\n\nt_rel=4: y=4\n\nt_rel=5: y=5 (after U at t_rel=4)\n\nt_rel=6: y=4 (after D at t_rel=5) because from y=5 at t_rel=5, go D to y=4 at t_rel=6.\n\nThen at t_rel=6, y=4 safe.\n\nNow at t_rel=6, I need to choose action.\n\nIf I go U to y=5 at t_rel=7, but y=5 occupied at t_rel=7, collision.\n\nGo S to y=4 at t_rel=7, safe.\n\nGo D to y=3 at t_rel=7, safe.\n\nBut I need to go to y=9.\n\nFrom y=4 at t_rel=7, I can go U to y=5 at t_rel=8.\n\nAt t_rel=8, y=5: is it occupied? y=5 occupied only at t_rel=0,6,7. t_rel=8 not occupied, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=6 at t_rel=8: occupied at t_rel=0,6,7, not 8, safe.\n\nSo from t_rel=6, y=4, instead of going U immediately, I should stay or something.\n\nAt t_rel=6, y=4, I can go S to y=4 at t_rel=7.\n\nt_rel=7, y=4 safe, since not occupied.\n\nThen at t_rel=7, I can go U to y=5 at t_rel=8.\n\nt_rel=8, y=5 safe.\n\nThen U to y=6 at t_rel=9, safe.\n\nThen U to y=7 at t_rel=10, safe.\n\nU to y=8 at t_rel=11.\n\nAt t_rel=11, y=8: occupied? y=8 occupied at t_rel=11,12,13. Yes, occupied, collision.\n\nProblem again.\n\ny=8 occupied at t_rel=11,12,13.\n\nAt t_rel=11, if I am on y=8, collision.\n\nBut in the path, at t_rel=11, I am at y=8.\n\nNow, I need to avoid that.\n\nPerhaps delay or go faster.\n\nFirst, let's list the sequence I have so far with actions.\n\nStart: t_rel=0, y=2\n\nAction a_{t1} = D (to go to y=1)\n\nt_rel=1, y=1\n\nAction: U (to y=2 at t_rel=2)\n\nt_rel=2, y=2\n\nAction: U (to y=3 at t_rel=3)\n\nt_rel=3, y=3\n\nAction: U (to y=4 at t_rel=4)\n\nt_rel=4, y=4\n\nAction: U (to y=5 at t_rel=5)\n\nt_rel=5, y=5\n\nAction: D (to avoid y=5 or y=6 at t_rel=6, go to y=4)\n\nt_rel=6, y=4\n\nNow at t_rel=6, instead of moving, I should stay for one turn to avoid t_rel=7 for y=5.\n\nAt t_rel=6, y=4, I choose S, to stay at y=4 for t_rel=7.\n\nt_rel=7, y=4, safe.\n\nThen at t_rel=7, I choose U, to go to y=5 at t_rel=8.\n\nt_rel=8, y=5, safe (not occupied)\n\nThen U to y=6 at t_rel=9, safe\n\nU to y=7 at t_rel=10, safe\n\nNow at t_rel=10, y=7, which is safe, since y=7 occupied only at t_rel=1.\n\nThen I need to go to y=8 at some point.\n\nBut y=8 occupied at t_rel=11,12,13.\n\nIf I go U from y=7 at t_rel=10 to y=8 at t_rel=11, collision.\n\nIf I stay at y=7, S at t_rel=10, to y=7 at t_rel=11, safe, but not progress.\n\nIf I go down, worse.\n\nSo I need to be on y=8 at t_rel not in 11,12,13.\n\nOr on y=9.\n\nSince y=9 is safe, I can go directly to y=9 from y=8.\n\nBut y=8 must be safe when I am on it.\n\nOccupied times: t_rel=11,12,13\n\nSo for t_rel <=10 or t_rel>=14, y=8 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, I can be on y=8 at t_rel=10 or earlier, or t_rel=14 or later.\n\nNow from above, at t_rel=10, I am at y=7.\n\nI can go U to y=8 at t_rel=11, but t_rel=11 occupied.\n\nNot good.\n\nIf I stay at y=7 for some turns.\n\nFor example, at t_rel=10, y=7, I choose S to stay at y=7 for t_rel=11.\n\nt_rel=11, y=7, safe.\n\nThen at t_rel=11, I can choose to go U to y=8 at t_rel=12.\n\nBut t_rel=12, y=8 occupied, collision.\n\nSimilarly, if I go at t_rel=12 to y=8, same.\n\nOr if I stay longer.\n\nAt t_rel=11, y=7, if I choose S again, to y=7 at t_rel=12.\n\nThen at t_rel=12, I can go U to y=8 at t_rel=13, but t_rel=13 occupied.\n\nStill bad.\n\nIf I go at t_rel=13 to y=8, occupied.\n\nThe next safe time for y=8 is t_rel=14.\n\nAt t_rel=14, y=8 not occupied.\n\nSo I need to reach y=8 at t_rel=14 or later.\n\nBut I want minimal H, so t_rel=14.\n\nNow from y=7 at t_rel=10, I need to stay until I can go to y=8 at t_rel=14? But from y=7, if I stay, I stay at y=7.\n\nAt t_rel=10, y=7.\n\nIf I choose S at t_rel=10, I am at y=7 at t_rel=11.\n\nS at t_rel=11, at y=7 at t_rel=12.\n\nS at t_rel=12, at y=7 at t_rel=13.\n\nThen at t_rel=13, I choose U, to go to y=8 at t_rel=14.\n\nt_rel=14, y=8, which should be safe, since occupied only up to t_rel=13? t_rel=13 is occupied, but t_rel=14 not.\n\ny=8 occupied at t_rel=11,12,13.\n\nt_rel=14 not occupied, so safe.\n\nThen from y=8 at t_rel=14, I can go U to y=9 at t_rel=15.\n\nt_rel=15, y=9, goal.\n\nNow, let's list the sequence with t_rel.\n\nFirst, from start:\n\nt_rel=0: y=2, action D (to y=1)\n\nt_rel=1: y=1, action U (to y=2)\n\nt_rel=2: y=2, action U (to y=3)\n\nt_rel=3: y=3, action U (to y=4)\n\nt_rel=4: y=4, action U (to y=5)\n\nt_rel=5: y=5, action D (to y=4)  // to avoid t_rel=6\n\nt_rel=6: y=4, action S (stay to avoid moving to y=5 at t_rel=7)\n\nt_rel=7: y=4, action U (to y=5 at t_rel=8)\n\nt_rel=8: y=5, action U (to y=6 at t_rel=9)\n\nt_rel=9: y=6, action U (to y=7 at t_rel=10)\n\nt_rel=10: y=7, action S (stay at y=7 for t_rel=11)\n\nt_rel=11: y=7, action S (stay for t_rel=12)\n\nt_rel=12: y=7, action S (stay for t_rel=13)\n\nt_rel=13: y=7, action U (to y=8 at t_rel=14)\n\nt_rel=14: y=8, action U (to y=9 at t_rel=15)\n\nt_rel=15: y=9\n\nSo I reached at t_rel=15, with H=16 turns? t_rel from 0 to 15, that's 16 positions, but number of actions.\n\nStart at t_rel=0, after H actions, at turn t_rel=H, position y_{t1+H}.\n\nWe start at turn t1, position y_{t1}.\n\nAfter action a_{t1}, we go to y_{t1+1} at turn t1+1.\n\nAfter H actions, we are at y_{t1+H} at turn t1+H.\n\nWe need y_{t1+H} =9.\n\nIn the sequence, from t_rel=0 to t_rel=15, that's 15 steps? Let's index.\n\nAt turn t1 + t for t=0 to H, but the actions are from t=0 to H-1.\n\nSet: at turn T, for T = t1, t1+1, ..., up to t1+H.\n\nAt turn T, position y_T.\n\nAfter H actions, we have positions from y_{t1} to y_{t1+H}.\n\ny_{t1} is given, y_{t1+H} =9.\n\nNumber of actions H.\n\nIn terms of t_rel, t_rel = T - t1.\n\nAt t_rel=0: y=2\n\nAfter first action, at t_rel=1: y=1\n\nAfter second action, at t_rel=2: y=2\n\n...\n\nIn the sequence above, we have actions from action at t_rel=0 to action at t_rel=14, leading to positions from t_rel=0 to t_rel=15.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- Action at t_rel=0 (turn t1): D, to y=1 at t_rel=1\n\n- Action at t_rel=1 (turn t1+1): U, to y=2 at t_rel=2\n\n- Action at t_rel=2: U, to y=3 at t_rel=3\n\n- Action at t_rel=3: U, to y=4 at t_rel=4\n\n- Action at t_rel=4: U, to y=5 at t_rel=5\n\n- Action at t_rel=5: D, to y=4 at t_rel=6\n\n- Action at t_rel=6: S, to y=4 at t_rel=7  // stay\n\n- Action at t_rel=7: U, to y=5 at t_rel=8\n\n- Action at t_rel=8: U, to y=6 at t_rel=9\n\n- Action at t_rel=9: U, to y=7 at t_rel=10\n\n- Action at t_rel=10: S, to y=7 at t_rel=11  // stay\n\n- Action at t_rel=11: S, to y=7 at t_rel=12  // stay\n\n- Action at t_rel=12: S, to y=7 at t_rel=13  // stay\n\n- Action at t_rel=13: U, to y=8 at t_rel=14\n\n- Action at t_rel=14: U, to y=9 at t_rel=15\n\nSo at t_rel=15, y=9, which is turn t1+15.\n\nNumber of actions: from t_rel=0 to t_rel=14, that's 15 actions? t_rel from 0 to 14 inclusive is 15 actions.\n\nActions: indices t from 0 to H-1 for t_rel, but H is the number.\n\nSet: actions are taken at turns t1, t1+1, ..., up to t1+H-1, and after H actions, at turn t1+H.\n\nHere, actions at t_rel=0 to 14 (15 actions), to reach at t_rel=15.\n\nBut t_rel=15 corresponds to turn t1+15.\n\nH=15 actions.\n\nBut we need minimal H, this might not be minimal.\n\nIn this path, I used many S and one D, so it took 15 turns from start to reach y=9.\n\nBut perhaps I can do better.\n\nFor example, after reaching y=7, instead of staying three turns, I could go to y=8 earlier if possible, but y=8 is occupied from t_rel=11 to 13, so I have to wait until t_rel=14.\n\nt_rel=14 is the earliest I can be on y=8 safely.\n\nBut I reached y=7 at t_rel=10.\n\nFrom y=7 at t_rel=10, I need to be at y=8 at t_rel=14 or later.\n\nSo I have to stay at y=7 for some turns.\n\nThe number of stays needed: from t_rel=10 to t_rel=13, I stay at y=7 for three turns, so at t_rel=13 I am still at y=7, then go to y=8 at t_rel=14.\n\nThen to y=9 at t_rel=15.\n\nBut at t_rel=10, I am at y=7, and I stay until t_rel=13, so positions: t_rel=10,11,12,13 all at y=7.\n\nThen t_rel=14 at y=8, t_rel=15 at y=9.\n\nNow, is there a way to reach y=7 earlier?\n\nIn the beginning, I went down to y=1 to avoid t_rel=1.\n\nBut perhaps I can go to other rows at t_rel=1.\n\nFor example, at start, from y=2 at t_rel=0, instead of going down, is there another choice?\n\nAt t_rel=0, y=2, if I go U to y=3 at t_rel=1, but y=3 occupied at t_rel=1, collision.\n\nGo S to y=2 at t_rel=1, occupied, collision.\n\nGo D to y=1 at t_rel=1, safe, as before.\n\nSo only choice is to go to y=1 at t_rel=1.\n\nNow, from y=1 at t_rel=1, I could go directly to higher rows if possible.\n\nFor example, at t_rel=1, y=1, I can go U to y=2 at t_rel=2, as before.\n\nBut at t_rel=2, y=2 is safe.\n\nI could go to y=5 or something, but I can only change by 1 each turn.\n\nSo from y=1, I can only go to y=0,1,2.\n\ny=0 is safe, but going down might not help.\n\nSo going to y=2 at t_rel=2 is fine.\n\nThen proceed.\n\nBut when I reach y=5 at t_rel=5.\n\nInstead of going down, I could stay at y=5 but at t_rel=5, y=5 is safe, but if I stay at t_rel=6, y=5 occupied.\n\nSo I must leave y=5 before t_rel=6.\n\nSimilarly, I cannot be on y=5 or y=6 at t_rel=6 or 7.\n\nSo from t_rel=5, y=5, I go down to y=4 at t_rel=6.\n\nThen I stayed at y=4 for t_rel=7 to avoid going to y=5 at t_rel=7, which would be occupied.\n\nBut at t_rel=7, y=5 occupied, so if I go to y=5 at t_rel=7, collision, but I stayed at y=4.\n\nThen at t_rel=7, I go to y=5 at t_rel=8, safe.\n\nNow, the delay is mainly for y=8.\n\ny=8 is occupied from t_rel=11 to 13.\n\nI reach y=7 at t_rel=10.\n\nIf I can reach y=7 earlier, I can start waiting earlier.\n\nIn the sequence, I reached y=7 at t_rel=10.\n\nLet's see if I can reach y=7 sooner.\n\nStart: t_rel=0, y=2, action D to y=1 at t_rel=1\n\nt_rel=1, y=1, action U to y=2 at t_rel=2\n\nt_rel=2, y=2, action U to y=3 at t_rel=3\n\nt_rel=3, y=3, action U to y=4 at t_rel=4\n\nt_rel=4, y=4, action U to y=5 at t_rel=5\n\nt_rel=5, y=5, now instead of going down, can I go directly to y=6? But at t_rel=6, y=6 occupied.\n\nIf I go U to y=6 at t_rel=6, collision.\n\nS or D as before.\n\nBut from y=5 at t_rel=5, if I go U, to y=6 at t_rel=6, collision.\n\nNo.\n\nPerhaps from y=4 at t_rel=4, I can go to y=5 later or something.\n\nAt t_rel=4, y=4, I can choose to stay at y=4 for one turn.\n\nFor example, at t_rel=4, action S, to y=4 at t_rel=5.\n\nt_rel=5, y=4, which is safe.\n\nThen at t_rel=5, y=4, I can go U to y=5 at t_rel=6.\n\nBut at t_rel=6, y=5 occupied! Because y=5 occupied at t_rel=6.\n\nSo collision if I go to y=5 at t_rel=6.\n\nIf at t_rel=5, y=4, I go U to y=5 at t_rel=6, collision.\n\nIf I go S to y=4 at t_rel=6, safe.\n\nOr D to y=3.\n\nBut not helpful.\n\nThen from y=4 at t_rel=6, I can go to y=5 at t_rel=7, but y=5 occupied at t_rel=7.\n\nStill bad.\n\nSo the only way is to be on y=5 at t_rel=5 or earlier, or after t_rel=7.\n\nSimilarly for y=6.\n\nIn my first sequence, I was at y=5 at t_rel=5, which is safe, then down to avoid t_rel=6, then stay to avoid t_rel=7, then up at t_rel=8.\n\nt_rel=5: y=5, go down to y=4 at t_rel=6.\n\nt_rel=6: y=4, stay to y=4 at t_rel=7.\n\nt_rel=7: y=4, go up to y=5 at t_rel=8.\n\nSo from t_rel=5 to t_rel=8, I moved from y=5 to y=4 to y=4 to y=5, wasting two turns essentially.\n\nBut I need to avoid the dangerous times.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=7 faster.\n\nAnother idea: since y=1 is safe, I could stay at y=1 for some turns, but that might not help.\n\nOr go to y=0.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nTo reach y=7 earlier.\n\nFrom start, after going to y=1 at t_rel=1, at t_rel=1, y=1, I could go U to y=2 at t_rel=2.\n\nThen U to y=3 at t_rel=3.\n\nThen U to y=4 at t_rel=4.\n\nNow at t_rel=4, y=4, instead of going to y=5, I could go directly to y=6? No, can only move one step.\n\nUnless I go to y=5 at some point.\n\nBut y=5 must be crossed.\n\nPerhaps I can delay going up.\n\nFor example, at t_rel=1, y=1, I stay at y=1 for multiple turns.\n\nBut that would make me reach later.\n\nWorse.\n\nGo to y=0.\n\nBut y=0 not freeway, safe, but below.\n\nFor example, at t_rel=1, y=1, go D to y=0 at t_rel=2.\n\nt_rel=2, y=0, safe.\n\nThen from there go up, but I need to go through the freeways.\n\nAt t_rel=2, y=0, go U to y=1 at t_rel=3.\n\nThen same as before, but I am later.\n\nt_rel=3, y=1, then U to y=2 at t_rel=4, and so on.\n\nCompared to original, I have t_rel=2 at y=0 instead of y=2, so I lost two steps: at t_rel=2 I was at y=0, whereas in first sequence I was at y=2 at t_rel=2.\n\nSo slower.\n\nNot better.\n\nPerhaps from y=4, I can go to y=5 at a different time.\n\nBut I have to be on y=5 between t_rel=5 and t_rel=5 or after t_rel=7.\n\nSince I reach y=4 at t_rel=4, I can go to y=5 at t_rel=5, which I did.\n\nThen I must leave before t_rel=6.\n\nSo I think the sequence I have is reasonable.\n\nNow for y=8, I need to be there at t_rel=14.\n\nI reach y=7 at t_rel=10.\n\nSo I need to stay at y=7 for 4 turns? From t_rel=10 to t_rel=13, that's 4 positions at y=7: t_rel=10,11,12,13.\n\nThen to y=8 at t_rel=14, y=9 at t_rel=15.\n\nBut at t_rel=10, I am at y=7 after moving from y=6.\n\nIn the sequence, I reached y=7 at t_rel=10.\n\nCan I reach y=7 earlier?\n\nLet's list the t_rel when I am at each y.\n\nIn first part:\n\nt_rel=0: y=2\n\nt_rel=1: y=1\n\nt_rel=2: y=2\n\nt_rel=3: y=3\n\nt_rel=4: y=4\n\nt_rel=5: y=5\n\nt_rel=6: y=4\n\nt_rel=7: y=4\n\nt_rel=8: y=5\n\nt_rel=9: y=6\n\nt_rel=10: y=7\n\nFrom t_rel=10 to t_rel=13: I stay at y=7? In my action sequence, at t_rel=10, I am at y=7, then I choose S to stay at y=7 for t_rel=11, S for t_rel=12, S for t_rel=13, then U to y=8 at t_rel=14.\n\nt_rel=10: y=7\n\nAction S at t_rel=10: to y=7 at t_rel=11\n\nAction S at t_rel=11: to y=7 at t_rel=12\n\nAction S at t_rel=12: to y=7 at t_rel=13\n\nAction U at t_rel=13: to y=8 at t_rel=14\n\nAction U at t_rel=14: to y=9 at t_rel=15\n\nYes.\n\nNow, at t_rel=10,11,12,13 all at y=7, which is safe.\n\nBut I could reduce the waiting time if I can reach y=7 later or something, but I want to minimize H, so I should reach as early as possible.\n\nt_rel=10 is when I reach y=7.\n\nIs it possible to reach y=7 before t_rel=10?\n\nFor example, from start, can I go faster?\n\nAt t_rel=0, y=2, must go D to y=1 at t_rel=1.\n\nThen at t_rel=1, y=1, go U to y=2 at t_rel=2.\n\nThen U to y=3 at t_rel=3.\n\nU to y=4 at t_rel=4.\n\nNow at t_rel=4, y=4, if I go U to y=5 at t_rel=5.\n\nThen at t_rel=5, y=5, I have to do something to avoid t_rel=6 and 7.\n\nIf I go U to y=6 at t_rel=6, but y=6 occupied at t_rel=6, collision.\n\nGo D to y=4 at t_rel=6.\n\nThen at t_rel=6, y=4.\n\nNow, if I go U to y=5 at t_rel=7, but y=5 occupied at t_rel=7, collision.\n\nSo I must stay at y=4 or go down at t_rel=6.\n\nAt t_rel=6, y=4, go S to y=4 at t_rel=7.\n\nThen at t_rel=7, y=4, go U to y=5 at t_rel=8.\n\nThen U to y=6 at t_rel=9.\n\nU to y=7 at t_rel=10.\n\nSame as before.\n\nFrom t_rel=5, y=5, instead of going down, I could go down earlier, but no.\n\nAnother idea: go to y=6 directly from y=5 at a safe time, but no safe time between.\n\nOr, since y=8 is safe after t_rel=13, I could go to y=8 first or something, but I have to go through y=7.\n\nUnless I can skip, but no.\n\nPerhaps I can reach y=8 at t_rel=14 directly without much delay, but I have to go through the rows.\n\nMinimal steps to go from y=2 to y=9 is 7, but with detours and waits, H=15 actions.\n\nBut let's count the net up moves.\n\nFrom y=2 to y=9, need 7 U.\n\nIn the sequence, I have U at: t_rel=1 (to y=2), t_rel=2 (to y=3), t_rel=3 (to y=4), t_rel=4 (to y=5), t_rel=7 (to y=5? t_rel=7 action to y=5 at t_rel=8), list actions:\n\nActions:\n\nt_rel=0: D\n\nt_rel=1: U\n\nt_rel=2: U\n\nt_rel=3: U\n\nt_rel=4: U\n\nt_rel=5: D\n\nt_rel=6: S\n\nt_rel=7: U  // to y=5\n\nt_rel=8: U  // to y=6\n\nt_rel=9: U  // to y=7\n\nt_rel=10: S\n\nt_rel=11: S\n\nt_rel=12: S\n\nt_rel=13: U  // to y=8\n\nt_rel=14: U  // to y=9\n\nU actions: at t_rel=1,2,3,4,7,8,9,13,14 → 9 U actions?

Mistake.\n\ny positions:\n\nt_rel=0: y=2\n\nAfter action t_rel=0 D: y=1 at t_rel=1\n\nAfter U t_rel=1: y=2 at t_rel=2\n\nAfter U t_rel=2: y=3 at t_rel=3\n\nAfter U t_rel=3: y=4 at t_rel=4\n\nAfter U t_rel=4: y=5 at t_rel=5\n\nAfter D t_rel=5: y=4 at t_rel=6\n\nAfter S t_rel=6: y=4 at t_rel=7\n\nAfter U t_rel=7: y=5 at t_rel=8\n\nAfter U t_rel=8: y=6 at t_rel=9\n\nAfter U t_rel=9: y=7 at t_rel=10\n\nAfter S t_rel=10: y=7 at t_rel=11\n\nAfter S t_rel=11: y=7 at t_rel=12\n\nAfter S t_rel=12: y=7 at t_rel=13\n\nAfter U t_rel=13: y=8 at t_rel=14\n\nAfter U t_rel=14: y=9 at t_rel=15\n\nFrom t_rel=0 y=2 to t_rel=15 y=9, 15 steps, 7 net up moves, but with one down and three stays, so 15 actions.\n\nNow, the three stays at t_rel=10,11,12 are to wait for y=8 to be safe.\n\nBut I could reduce if I can be at y=8 at t_rel=14 but reach y=8 faster.\n\nFor example, if I can be at y=8 at t_rel=10, but y=8 is safe at t_rel=10, since occupied only 11,12,13.\n\nAt t_rel=10, y=8 is safe.\n\nBut I reach y=7 at t_rel=10, so I can go to y=8 at t_rel=11, but t_rel=11 y=8 occupied.\n\nCannot.\n\nIf I reach y=8 at t_rel=10.\n\nBut to reach y=8 at t_rel=10, I need to be at y=7 at t_rel=9.\n\nAt t_rel=9, y=7.\n\ny=7 is safe at all times except t_rel=1.\n\nAt t_rel=9, safe.\n\nBut to be at y=7 at t_rel=9, I need to come from y=6 at t_rel=8 or y=8 or y=7.\n\nFrom below.\n\ny=6 at t_rel=8: y=6 occupied at t_rel=0,6,7; t_rel=8 not occupied, safe.\n\nBut to be at y=6 at t_rel=8, I need to come from y=5 at t_rel=7 or y=7 or y=6.\n\nAt t_rel=7, if I go to y=6, but y=6 occupied at t_rel=7? Yes, occupied, so cannot be on y=6 at t_rel=7.\n\nSimilarly, at t_rel=6, y=6 occupied.\n\nSo the only way to be on y=6 is at t_rel not 0,6,7.\n\nSimilarly for y=5.\n\nSo to be at y=6 at t_rel=8, I can, since not occupied.\n\nBut to get there, from y=5 at t_rel=7, but at t_rel=7, y=5 occupied, so I cannot be on y=5 at t_rel=7 to go to y=6.\n\nIf I am on y=5 at t_rel=7, collision, cannot.\n\nFrom y=7 at t_rel=7, but y=7 safe, but to go to y=6 at t_rel=8, I would need to go down, which is not efficient.\n\nFor example, at t_rel=7, if I am at y=7, I can go D to y=6 at t_rel=8, but then I am at y=6, which is fine at t_rel=8, but I wanted to go up.\n\nNot helpful.\n\nSo the earliest I can be at y=6 is t_rel=8, from y=5 at t_rel=7, but y=5 at t_rel=7 occupied, impossible.\n\ny=5 at t_rel=7 occupied, so I cannot be on y=5 to go to y=6.\n\nTherefore, I cannot be at y=6 at t_rel=8 because to reach it, I need to be at y=5 or y=7 at t_rel=7.\n\nIf at y=5 at t_rel=7, occupied, collision.\n\nIf at y=7 at t_rel=7, I can go D to y=6 at t_rel=8.\n\nBut at t_rel=7, y=7 is safe, then go D to y=6 at t_rel=8.\n\nThen at t_rel=8, y=6, safe.\n\nThen I can go U to y=7 at t_rel=9.\n\nThen at t_rel=9, y=7, go U to y=8 at t_rel=10.\n\nAt t_rel=10, y=8, which is safe! Since not occupied.\n\nThen go U to y=9 at t_rel=11.\n\nt_rel=11, y=9.\n\nNow, this is better.\n\nLet's see.\n\nStart from beginning.\n\nt_rel=0: y=2, action D to y=1 at t_rel=1 (to avoid)\n\nt_rel=1: y=1, action U to y=2 at t_rel=2\n\nt_rel=2: y=2, action U to y=3 at t_rel=3\n\nt_rel=3: y=3, action U to y=4 at t_rel=4\n\nt_rel=4: y=4, action U to y=5 at t_rel=5\n\nt_rel=5: y=5, now instead of going down, I need to avoid t_rel=6 and t_rel=7 for y=5 and y=6.\n\nAt t_rel=5, y=5, I can go U to y=6 at t_rel=6, but occupied, collision.\n\nGo S to y=5 at t_rel=6, occupied.\n\nGo D to y=4 at t_rel=6, safe.\n\nBut then as before.\n\nTo reach y=7 at t_rel=7.\n\nAt t_rel=7, y=7 is safe.\n\nIf I can be at y=7 at t_rel=7.\n\nThen from y=7, I can go to y=8 at t_rel=8, but y=8 at t_rel=8 is safe? y=8 occupied only at t_rel=11,12,13, so t_rel=8 safe.\n\nThen to y=9 at t_rel=9.\n\nBut can I reach y=7 at t_rel=7?\n\nFrom above, at t_rel=4, y=4.\n\nGo U to y=5 at t_rel=5.\n\nt_rel=5, y=5.\n\nNow from here, to be at y=7 at t_rel=7, I need to go up twice.\n\nBut at t_rel=6, if I go to y=6, occupied.\n\nIf I go to y=5 at t_rel=6, occupied.\n\nSo impossible to be on y=5 or y=6 at t_rel=6.\n\nTherefore, I cannot reach y=7 at t_rel=7 directly.\n\nThe only way is to be at a safe position at t_rel=6.\n\nFor example, at t_rel=5, y=5, go D to y=4 at t_rel=6.\n\nThen at t_rel=6, y=4, I can go U to y=5 at t_rel=7, but y=5 occupied at t_rel=7, collision.\n\nGo S to y=4 at t_rel=7.\n\nThen go U to y=5 at t_rel=8, as before.\n\nSo I think the first sequence is fine, but with the alternative for the end.\n\nIn the alternative I thought: reach y=7 at t_rel=7 by going down and up, but I can't.\n\nIn my second idea: from t_rel=7, y=7, go D to y=6 at t_rel=8.\n\nt_rel=8, y=6, safe.\n\nThen U to y=7 at t_rel=9.\n\nThen U to y=8 at t_rel=10.\n\nBut y=8 at t_rel=10 safe.\n\nThen U to y=9 at t_rel=11.\n\nBut in this case, I reached y=9 at t_rel=11, with fewer actions.\n\nBut how to reach y=7 at t_rel=7.\n\nIn the beginning, same as before to t_rel=4.\n\nt_rel=4: y=4\n\nAction U to y=5 at t_rel=5\n\nThen at t_rel=5, y=5, action D to y=4 at t_rel=6  // to avoid\n\nt_rel=6: y=4, action S to y=4 at t_rel=7? No, to reach y=7 at t_rel=7.\n\nAt t_rel=6, y=4, I need to go to y=7 in one step? Impossible, max U to y=5.\n\nSo at t_rel=6, y=4, action U to y=5 at t_rel=7, but occupied.\n\nCannot.\n\nSo I must have y=4 at t_rel=7, then to y=5 at t_rel=8, etc.\n\nThus, to reach y=7 at t_rel=10 is the earliest, I think.\n\nIn the sequence with the down move to y=6:\n\nFrom t_rel=10, y=7, instead of staying, I can go D to y=6 at t_rel=11, but y=6 at t_rel=11: occupied? y=6 occupied at t_rel=0,6,7; t_rel=11 not, so safe.\n\nBut then I am at y=6, lower, not helpful.\n\nGo to y=8 directly if possible, but not.\n\nSo the waiting is necessary.\n\nTherefore, the sequence with H=15 actions seems necessary.\n\nBut let's confirm the actions for the turn.\n\nCurrent turn t1=17.\n\nActions from turn 17 to turn 17+H-1, to reach at turn 17+H.\n\nIn t_rel, actions at t_rel=0 to H-1, to position at t_rel=H.\n\nWe need y_{t1+H} =9.\n\nIn sequence, at t_rel=15, y=9.\n\nt_rel=15 means turn t1+15.\n\nActions at turns t1 to t1+14, that is 15 actions.\n\nMinimal H.\n\nPerhaps I can save one turn by not staying at y=4.\n\nAnother idea: at t_rel=5, y=5, instead of going down, I go up to y=6 at t_rel=6, but occupied, collision, not possible.\n\nOr, at t_rel=4, y=4, I stay at y=4 for t_rel=5.\n\nt_rel=4 action S to y=4 at t_rel=5.\n\nt_rel=5, y=4, safe.\n\nThen action U to y=5 at t_rel=6, but y=5 occupied at t_rel=6, collision.\n\nNot possible.\n\nSo I think H=15 is the minimal.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to list the actions.\n\nIn the sequence I have, but at the end, when I go to y=8 at t_rel=14, but t_rel=14 is turn 17+14=31, and y=8 at t_rel=14 is safe since not occupied.\n\nThen to y=9 at t_rel=15.\n\nIn the car for y=8, occupied at t_rel=11,12,13, so t_rel=14 not.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, the actions:\n\nTurn t1=17: action D (since at t_rel=0, action D)\n\nThen turn 18: U (t_rel=1 action U)\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nTurn 20: U\n\nTurn 21: U  // t_rel=4 action U to y=5\n\nTurn 22: D  // t_rel=5 action D to y=4\n\nTurn 23: S  // t_rel=6 action S to y=4\n\nTurn 24: U  // t_rel=7 action U to y=5\n\nTurn 25: U  // to y=6\n\nTurn 26: U  // to y=7\n\nTurn 27: S  // stay at y=7\n\nTurn 28: S  // stay\n\nTurn 29: S  // stay\n\nTurn 30: U  // to y=8\n\nTurn 31: U  // to y=9\n\nReach at turn 31.\n\nH=15 actions.\n\nBut turn 17 to 31 is 15 turns? Turns: 17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31: that's 15 actions, from turn 17 to turn 31 inclusive? Number of turns: from 17 to 31 is 15 actions? 31-17+1=15, yes.\n\nPosition at turn 31 is y=9.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 17: position y=2, after action, at turn 18 y=1, etc., at turn 31 y=9.\n\nNow, to write the answer.\n\nBut the problem says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1}\"\n\nSo for t from 0 to 14, actions.\n\nt1=17.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 17: a_{17} = D\n\nTurn 18: a_{18} = U\n\nTurn 19: a_{19} = U\n\nTurn 20: a_{20} = U\n\nTurn 21: a_{21} = U\n\nTurn 22: a_{22} = D\n\nTurn 23: a_{23} = S\n\nTurn 24: a_{24} = U\n\nTurn 25: a_{25} = U\n\nTurn 26: a_{26} = U\n\nTurn 27: a_{27} = S\n\nTurn 28: a_{28} = S\n\nTurn 29: a_{29} = S\n\nTurn 30: a_{30} = U\n\nTurn 31: a_{31} = U\n\nBut at turn 31, action U to y=9 at turn 32? Mistake.\n\nLet's clarify.\n\nThe action at turn T determines y_{T+1}.\n\nAt turn T, position y_T, choose action a_T, then y_{T+1} = y_T + delta.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nAt turn 17 (t_rel=0): y=2, choose a_{17}, say D, then y_{18} =1\n\nAt turn 18 (t_rel=1): y=1, choose a_{18}=U, then y_{19}=2\n\n...\n\nAt turn 30 (t_rel=13): y=7, choose a_{30}=U, then y_{31}=8\n\nAt turn 31 (t_rel=14): y=8, choose a_{31}=U, then y_{32}=9\n\nSo at turn 32, y=9.\n\nThus actions from turn 17 to 31, that's 15 actions, to reach at turn 32.\n\nH=15, reach at t1+H =17+15=32.\n\nIn the sequence, the last action is at turn 31, to go to y=9 at turn 32.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be actions for turn t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nHere t1=17, H=15, so actions from turn 17 to 31.\n\nAnd y at turn 32 is 9.\n\nIn the sequence above, I have a_{31}=U, which is correct.\n\nBut in the list, turn 31: a_{31}=U\n\nIn the sequence I wrote, I have up to turn 31 action U.\n\nBut in the earlier list, I had turn 31: U, but that is a_{31}, to go to y=9.\n\nNow, for the stay actions, etc.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nTo confirm, let's write the turn and action.\n\nAlso, in the beginning, I have turn 23: S, which is at y=4, stay.\n\nNow, for the answer.\n\nSo minimal H=15.\n\nBut is there a shorter sequence?\n\nSuppose I go to y=1 at t_rel=1, then at t_rel=1, I go S to stay at y=1 for t_rel=2, but then I am at y=1 at t_rel=2, which is fine, but I need to go up, so it delays.\n\nWorse.\n\nOr, from y=4, I can go to y=3 or something, but not better.\n\nI think 15 is minimal.\n\nAnother point: at t_rel=1, when I am at y=1, I could go to y=0, but then come back, waste.\n\nNo.\n\nSo I think it's good.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 2)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 17\\) is 15. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by moving down to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 18 to avoid the collision on \\(y = 2, 3, 4\\) at turn 18, moving down and staying to avoid the collisions on \\(y = 5\\) and \\(y = 6\\) at turns 23 and 24, and staying on \\(y = 7\\) for multiple turns to avoid the collision on \\(y = 8\\) at turns 28 to 30.\n\nThe action sequence is as follows:\n\n- At turn 17, move down (D) to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 18, avoiding collision on \\(y = 2\\) at turn 18.\n- At turn 18, move up (U) to \\(y = 2\\) at turn 19.\n- At turn 19, move up (U) to \\(y = 3\\) at turn 20.\n- At turn 20, move up (U) to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 21.\n- At turn 21, move up (U) to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 22.\n- At turn 22, move down (D) to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 23, avoiding collision on \\(y = 6\\) at turn 23.\n- At turn 23, stay (S) at \\(y = 4\\) for turn 24, avoiding movement to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 24 (which would collide at turn 24).\n- At turn 24, move up (U) to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 25.\n- At turn 25, move up (U) to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 26.\n- At turn 26, move up (U) to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 27.\n- At turn 27, stay (S) at \\(y = 7\\) for turn 28, avoiding collision on \\(y = 8\\) at turn 28.\n- At turn 28, stay (S) at \\(y = 7\\) for turn 29, avoiding collision on \\(y = 8\\) at turn 29.\n- At turn 29, stay (S) at \\(y = 7\\) for turn 30, avoiding collision on \\(y = 8\\) at turn 30.\n- At turn 30, move up (U) to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 31, since \\(y = 8\\) is safe at turn 31.\n- At turn 31, move up (U) to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 32, reaching the goal.\n\nThis sequence ensures the player reaches \\((0, 9)\\) at turn 32 (i.e., after 15 actions) without any collisions.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 17: & D \\\\ \\text{Turn } 18: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 19: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 20: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 21: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 22: & D \\\\ \\text{Turn } 23: & S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 24: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 25: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 26: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 27: & S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 28: & S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 29: & S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 30: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 31: & U \\\\ \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>We are given the current turn t1 = 19 and the player is at (0,2). The goal is to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nPlayer movement:\n- U: y increases by 1 (if not at 9)\n- D: y decreases by 1 (if not at 0)\n- S: stay at same y\n\nCollision condition:\nAt turn T, if the player is on freeway y (which is from 1 to 8) and at that same turn T, there is a car on that freeway such that the car's span at turn T includes 0 (the x-coordinate of the player), then collision occurs.\n\nImportant note: When moving from y to y' at turn T, the player is considered to be on y at turn T and on y' at turn T+1. So if at turn T we move to a new freeway, we are only on the new freeway at the next turn.\n\nGiven car states at turn t1=19:\n\nWe need to compute the car spans at any future turn T (>=19). The formula for the car span at turn T (with T = t1 + dt, so dt = T - 19) is:\n\nFor a car given at turn 19 with (head, tail, direction, speed):\n- If direction is 'right': \n   head_T = head_19 + s * (T - 19)\n   tail_T = tail_19 + s * (T - 19)\n   and the span is [tail_T, head_T] (since head>tail for right-moving? Actually, note the example: for a right-moving car, the head is the front? But in the initial data, we see for freeway 1: (-24,-47,right,24). Here head=-24, tail=-47, so head>tail? Actually, -24 > -47. So for right-moving, the head is the rightmost? Then the car spans from tail to head? But note: at turn T, the car moves to the right, so the entire segment shifts right.\n\nBut note: the update rule says:\n  Right-moving: Span(T) = [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]   [since originally [tau, h] becomes [tau+s*dt, h+s*dt]]\n\nHowever, in the given data, we have for freeway 1: (head, tail) = (-24, -47) and direction right. So actually the representation in the table is (head, tail) but the update rule uses [tau, h]. So we must note that for a right-moving car, the initial span is [tail, head] (because tail is the left end and head is the right end). But in the update rule, it says for right-moving: [tau, h] becomes [tau + s*dt, h+s*dt]. So we can use the given tail and head as the endpoints.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving: [h, tau] becomes [h - s*dt, tau - s*dt]. But note: in the given data, all cars in this problem are right-moving? Let me check:\n\nAll cars in the given state have direction 'right'. So we only need the right-moving update.\n\nTherefore, for each car on a freeway, at turn T, the span is:\n   [tail + s*(T-19), head + s*(T-19)]\n\nCollision condition: at turn T, if the player is on freeway y (where y in {1,2,...,8}) and if the freeway has cars, then we check if 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nNote: if the player is at y=0 or y=9, there are no cars (freeways are only 1 to 8), so no collision.\n\nWe start at (0,2) at turn 19. We must reach (0,9) as soon as possible.\n\nWe can only move one step per turn (or stay). So the minimal number of turns to go from y=2 to y=9 is 7 (if we move up every turn). But we have to avoid the cars on freeways 3 to 8? Actually, we have to avoid cars on the freeway we are on at each turn.\n\nWe are going to simulate the moves and check for collisions.\n\nBut note: we can also move down? However, since we are at y=2 and we want to go to y=9, moving down would be counterproductive. But sometimes we might wait (stay) to avoid a car.\n\nWe are to find the minimal H and the sequence of actions from turn 19 to turn 19+H-1 such that at the last turn (turn 19+H-1) we are at y=9.\n\nLet me denote:\n  T0 = 19 (current turn)\n  We are at y_19 = 2.\n\nWe plan for t = 19, 20, 21, ... until we get to y=9.\n\nWe must avoid being on a freeway y (1<=y<=8) at turn T if at that turn T there is a car on that freeway that covers x=0.\n\nWe note that the player's y at turn T is determined by the actions taken from turn 19 to turn T-1 (if T>19). Specifically, at turn 19 we are at y=2. Then:\n  At turn 19: we take action a_19 -> y_20 = y_19 + delta(a_19)\n  At turn 20: we take action a_20 -> y_21 = y_20 + delta(a_20)\n  ...\n\nWe are at y=2 at turn 19. Then at turn 19, we choose an action (U, D, or S) which will determine y_20.\n\nBut note: at turn 19, we are on freeway y=2? Yes. So we must check at turn 19: is there a car on freeway 2 that has 0 in its span at T=19?\n\nSimilarly, at each future turn T, we must check the freeway we are on at that turn T.\n\nSo let's compute the car positions at turn 19 for each freeway to see if we are safe at the start.\n\nBut note: we are at turn 19 at the start, and we are at (0,2). We must check freeway 2 at turn 19.\n\nFreeway 2: cars: (60,25,right,36) -> but wait, there is only one car? Actually, the table says for freeway 2: (60,25,right,36). So we have one car.\n\nCompute its span at turn 19 (dt=0):\n   tail = 25, head = 60 -> span = [25, 60] at T=19. \n   Does 0 lie in [25,60]? No. So safe at turn 19 at freeway 2.\n\nNow, we need to plan the moves. We want to get to y=9 as quickly as possible. The minimal H is 7 (if we go up 7 times). But we must check if we can do that without colliding.\n\nWe will simulate the next turns. We are going to consider the sequence of moves: 7 ups. Then check at each turn T (from 19 to 19+6) for the freeway we are on.\n\nWe are at:\n  T=19: y=2 -> freeway 2: safe (as above).\n\nThen we do U: \n  T=20: y=3 -> freeway 3? Check freeway 3 at T=20.\n\nFreeway 3: one car (60,25,right,36). At T=20, dt=1:\n   tail_20 = 25 + 36*1 = 61\n   head_20 = 60 + 36*1 = 96\n   span = [61,96] -> does 0 lie in [61,96]? No.\n\nThen U: \n  T=21: y=4 -> freeway 4: car (60,25,right,36). At T=21, dt=2:\n      tail = 25 + 36*2 = 25+72=97\n      head = 60+72=132 -> [97,132] -> no 0.\n\nThen U:\n  T=22: y=5 -> freeway 5: has three cars: \n        car1: (-24,-35,right,6)\n        car2: (54,43,right,6) -> wait, 54 and 43? then tail=43, head=54? but the representation is (head, tail) so we have to be careful.\n\nThe table says: \n   Freeway 5: (-24,-35,right,6), (54,43,right,6), (18,7,right,6)\n\nBut note: for a right-moving car, the tail is the left end and head is the right end? But in the update, we use the tail and head as given. However, in the update rule we add s*dt to both. But we must form the interval [tail + s*dt, head + s*dt]. However, we must note the order: if the tail is less than the head, then the interval is [tail, head]. But if tail is greater than head, that would be backwards? Let's see:\n\nIn the given car: (-24,-35,right,6): tail=-35, head=-24 -> so tail < head -> [ -35, -24] at T=19.\nAt T=22, dt=3: \n   tail = -35 + 6*3 = -35+18 = -17\n   head = -24 + 18 = -6 -> [-17, -6] -> does 0 lie in [-17,-6]? No.\n\nSecond car: (54,43,right,6): tail=43, head=54 -> [43,54] at T=19. At T=22: \n   tail=43+18=61, head=54+18=72 -> [61,72] -> no.\n\nThird car: (18,7,right,6): tail=7, head=18 -> [7,18] at T=19. At T=22:\n   tail=7+18=25, head=18+18=36 -> [25,36] -> 0 not in there.\n\nSo freeway 5 at T=22 is safe.\n\nThen U:\n  T=23: y=6 -> freeway 6: same cars as freeway5? The table says for freeway6: same three cars? \n        (-24,-35,right,6), (54,43,right,6), (18,7,right,6)\n\nAt T=23, dt=4:\n  car1: tail=-35+6*4=-35+24=-11, head=-24+24=0 -> [-11,0] -> 0 is included? \n         So at T=23, freeway6 has a car that covers 0? \n         Specifically, the first car: [-11,0] -> 0 is the upper bound. Since it's a closed interval? We assume the car spans are inclusive? The problem says \"if 0 in Span(T)\".\n\nSo 0 is in [-11,0] -> collision.\n\nTherefore, if we go up at T=22 to y=6 at turn 23, we collide.\n\nSo we cannot do that. We must avoid that.\n\nThus, we cannot be on freeway6 at turn23.\n\nWhat can we do? We could wait at y=5 for one turn? Then at turn23 we are still at y=5? But then we have to check freeway5 at turn23.\n\nBut at turn23, freeway5: \n  car1: [-35+6*4, -24+24] = [-35+24, 0] = [-11,0] -> again 0 is included? So if we are at freeway5 at turn23, we also collide.\n\nAlternatively, we could move down? But that would be going back to y=4 at turn23? Then we avoid freeway5 and 6? But then we are at y=4 at turn23: freeway4 at turn23? \n  Freeway4: car (60,25,right,36) at T=23, dt=4: tail=25+36*4=25+144=169, head=60+144=204 -> [169,204] -> no 0.\n\nBut then we are at y=4 and we need to go to y=9 -> that's 5 more steps. We are at turn23 and we were at turn19: we have taken 4 moves and we are at y=4 (we did U,U,U and then D? so from 2->3->4->5->4). So we are at turn23 at y=4. Then we have to go up 5 times? So total turns from start: 4 (to get to y=4 at turn23) and then 5 more to get to y=9: so 9 moves? But maybe we can do better.\n\nAlternatively, we can wait at y=5 at turn22? But if we stay at y=5 at turn22, then at turn23 we are still at y=5? and we just saw that at turn23, freeway5 has a car that covers 0? so we collide.\n\nSo we cannot stay at y=5 at turn22? We must leave.\n\nBut we cannot go up to y=6 at turn23 because that also collides.\n\nSo we must go down to y=4 at turn23? Then we avoid the collision.\n\nBut then we are at y=4 at turn23. Then we need to go up again. But we have to avoid the same problem later? \n\nWe note that the car that causes the problem on freeway5 and freeway6 at turn23 is the same pattern? Actually, freeway5 and freeway6 have the same car configurations? So we have to be cautious.\n\nLet me compute the car movements for freeway5 and freeway6 for the next several turns.\n\nWe are particularly concerned about when a car covers 0.\n\nFor freeway5 and freeway6 (same cars?):\n\nCar1: initial at T=19: tail=-35, head=-24, speed=6, right.\n  At time T: tail_T = -35 + 6*(T-19)\n            head_T = -24 + 6*(T-19)\n\nCar2: tail=43, head=54 -> tail_T=43+6*(T-19), head_T=54+6*(T-19)\nCar3: tail=7, head=18 -> tail_T=7+6*(T-19), head_T=18+6*(T-19)\n\nWe are interested in when 0 is in the span of any car.\n\nCar1: 0 in [-35+6*(T-19), -24+6*(T-19)] \n   => -35+6*(T-19) <= 0 <= -24+6*(T-19)\n   Solve:\n        -35 + 6*(dt) <= 0  => 6*dt <= 35 -> dt <= 35/6 ≈ 5.83 -> dt<=5? \n        and 0 <= -24+6*dt -> 24 <= 6*dt -> dt>=4.\n\n   So for dt=4,5: \n        dt=4: [-35+24, -24+24] = [-11,0] -> 0 is included? yes.\n        dt=5: [-35+30, -24+30] = [-5,6] -> 0 is not in [-5,6]? actually 0 is in [-5,6]? because -5<=0<=6 -> yes.\n\n   Actually, for dt=5: [-5,6] includes 0. Then dt=6: [-35+36, -24+36] = [1,12] -> 0 not in.\n\n   So Car1 covers 0 at dt=4 and dt=5? Actually at T=19+4=23 and T=19+5=24.\n\n   But wait: at dt=5: T=24, we have [-5,6] -> 0 is included? yes.\n\nCar2: [43+6*dt, 54+6*dt] -> all positive? so never covers 0? since 43+6*dt >=43>0.\n\nCar3: [7+6*dt, 18+6*dt] -> also positive? so never covers 0.\n\nTherefore, for freeway5 and freeway6, the only car that covers 0 is car1, and that happens at T=23 (dt=4) and T=24 (dt=5).\n\nSo at freeway5 and freeway6, we must avoid being there at turn23 and turn24.\n\nNow, what about freeway7 and freeway8?\n\nWe also have freeway7 and freeway8 to go through.\n\nFreeway7: one car: (12,1,right,12) at T=19.\n  At T: tail=1+12*(T-19), head=12+12*(T-19)\n  When does it cover 0? \n      1+12*dt <=0? -> 12*dt<=-1 -> impossible. So never? because 1+12*dt>=1>0.\n\nFreeway8: (-36,-47,right,4) -> tail=-47, head=-36, right, speed=4.\n  At T: tail=-47+4*(T-19), head=-36+4*(T-19)\n  When does it cover 0?\n      -47+4*dt <=0 <= -36+4*dt\n      => \n        -47+4*dt<=0 -> 4*dt<=47 -> dt<=47/4=11.75 -> dt<=11\n        and 0<=-36+4*dt -> 4*dt>=36 -> dt>=9.\n\n      So for dt from 9 to 11: \n        dt=9: [-47+36, -36+36] = [-11,0] -> 0 included? yes.\n        dt=10: [-47+40, -36+40] = [-7,4] -> 0 included? yes.\n        dt=11: [-47+44, -36+44] = [-3,8] -> 0 included? yes.\n        dt=12: [-47+48, -36+48] = [1,12] -> no.\n\n      So freeway8 is dangerous at T=19+9=28, 29, 30, 31? Actually, dt=9 -> T=28, dt=10->29, dt=11->30.\n\nNow, we are at y=2 at turn19. We want to get to y=9. We have to go through y=3,4,5,6,7,8.\n\nWe saw that going straight up for 5 moves: \n   T19: y=2 (safe)\n   T20: y=3 (safe)\n   T21: y=4 (safe)\n   T22: y=5 (safe) -> but then at T23 we must not be at y=5 or y=6? because both are dangerous at T23 and T24.\n\nSo what if we do:\n\nOption 1: at T22 (when we are at y=5) we don't go up? We go down to y=4 at T23? Then at T23 we are at y=4 (freeway4) which is safe? \n   Freeway4: car (60,25,right,36) at T23: dt=4 -> [25+144, 60+144] = [169,204] -> safe.\n\nThen at T24, we can go up to y=5? but at T24, freeway5 is dangerous (because car1 at freeway5: at T24, dt=5 -> [-5,6] -> 0 included) -> so if we go to y=5 at T24, we collide.\n\nAlternatively, at T24 we stay at y=4? Then at T25 we go to y=5? \n   At T25, freeway5: car1: [-35+6*(25-19)= -35+6*6=-35+36=1, -24+36=12] -> [1,12] -> no 0 -> safe.\n\nSo:\n   T19: y=2 -> U -> y=3\n   T20: y=3 -> U -> y=4\n   T21: y=4 -> U -> y=5\n   T22: y=5 -> D -> y=4 (to avoid being at y=5 or 6 at T23)\n   T23: y=4 -> S (stay) -> y=4 (because if we go up at T23 to y=5, then at T23 we are at y=5? but wait: at T23, we are at y=4 and then we choose an action. If we choose U, then at T24 we are at y=5? But we want to avoid T24 at y=5? Actually, at T24 we would be at y=5? and freeway5 at T24 is dangerous? So we must avoid being at y=5 at T24.\n\n   So at T23, we stay at y=4? Then at T24 we are still at y=4? Then at T24 we can go to y=5? But at T24, if we go up, then at T25 we are at y=5? \n        Actually: \n          T23: we are at y=4 (from T22: we did D from y=5 to y=4 at T23? Let me clarify the timeline:\n\n   Turn 19: we are at y=2 (at the start of the turn). We take action a_19 -> then at turn20 we are at y_20 = y_19 + delta(a_19).\n   So:\n        T19: y=2 -> take U -> T20: y=3\n        T20: y=3 -> take U -> T21: y=4\n        T21: y=4 -> take U -> T22: y=5\n        T22: y=5 -> take D -> T23: y=4\n        T23: y=4 -> take S -> T24: y=4\n        T24: y=4 -> take U -> T25: y=5\n\n   Now at T25: freeway5 is safe? As above, car1: [1,12] -> no 0.\n\n   Then we can continue:\n        T25: y=5 -> U -> T26: y=6\n\n   At T26: freeway6? We must check freeway6 at T26: dt=26-19=7.\n        car1: [-35+6*7, -24+42] = [-35+42, -24+42] = [7,18] -> no 0? but wait, car1 at freeway6: same as freeway5? \n        Actually, freeway6 has the same cars? So at T26, car1: [7,18] -> safe.\n\n   Then T26: y=6 -> U -> T27: y=7\n        T27: freeway7: safe? as we saw, freeway7 car never covers 0? \n        But let me check at T27: dt=8 -> \n             car on freeway7: tail=1+12*8=1+96=97, head=12+96=108 -> safe.\n\n   Then T27: U -> T28: y=8\n        T28: freeway8: at T28, dt=9 -> car1: [-47+4*9, -36+36] = [-47+36, 0] = [-11,0] -> 0 included? so collision.\n\n   So we cannot be at freeway8 at T28.\n\nTherefore, we must avoid being at y=8 at T28.\n\nWhat to do? We can delay going to y=8 until T29? But at T29: freeway8: \n        car1: [-47+4*10, -36+40] = [-47+40, 4] = [-7,4] -> still 0 included? so collision.\n\nSimilarly, T30: [-47+44, -36+44] = [-3,8] -> 0 included? yes.\n\nT31: [-47+48, -36+48] = [1,12] -> safe.\n\nSo we must be at y=8 at T31? \n\nBut note: we are at T27: y=7. Then at T27 we can choose to stay at y=7? Then at T28 we are at y=7 (freeway7: safe). Then at T28 we can go to y=8? but T28: freeway8 is dangerous? so we cannot be at y=8 at T28.\n\nAlternatively, we can stay at y=7 for multiple turns? \n\nWe are at T27: y=7 (from T26: y=6, then U at T26 -> T27: y=7). Then:\n\nOption: \n   T27: S -> T28: y=7 (freeway7: safe? at T28: freeway7 car: tail=1+12*(28-19)=1+12*9=109, head=12+108=120 -> safe)\n   T28: S -> T29: y=7 -> safe? \n   T29: S -> T30: y=7 -> safe?\n   T30: U -> T31: y=8 -> freeway8 at T31: as above, [1,12] -> safe? \n   T31: U -> T32: y=9 -> goal.\n\nBut we started at turn19 and we are at turn32? That is 13 moves? \n\nBut we can try to be more efficient.\n\nAlternatively, we can go from y=7 to y=8 at T31? How? \n\nWe are at T27: y=7. Then we can stay at y=7 until T30? Then at T30: we go U to y=8 at T31? Then at T31 we are at y=8? and freeway8 is safe? Then at T32 we go to y=9? \n\nBut that means we stay at y=7 for 3 turns: T27, T28, T29? Then at T30 we go to y=8? \n\nBut we can also leave earlier? \n\nWe can also go down? but that would be inefficient.\n\nBut note: we must also avoid the freeway5 and freeway6 at the earlier times? \n\nLet me summarize the dangerous times for freeways:\n\nfreeway5 and freeway6: dangerous at T23, T24 (and also T25? we saw at T25: freeway5 is safe? because [1,12] at T25 for freeway5? so T25 is safe for freeway5? and freeway6 at T25: same? safe? and at T24: dangerous). So freeway5 and freeway6: avoid at T23 and T24.\n\nfreeway8: dangerous at T28, T29, T30. Safe at T31.\n\nSo we have two dangerous zones: T23-T24 for y=5,6 and T28-T30 for y=8.\n\nNow, we are at y=2 at T19. We can go up to y=5 by T22 (if we do U,U,U at T19,20,21). Then we must avoid being at y=5 or y=6 at T23 and T24.\n\nSo from T22 (y=5) we can go down to y=4 at T23? Then at T23 we are at y=4 (safe). Then at T24 we can go up to y=5? but that would put us at y=5 at T24? which is dangerous? so we cannot.\n\nSo we must stay at y=4 at T24? Then at T25 we go to y=5 (safe). \n\nThen we go:\n   T25: y=5 -> U -> T26: y=6 (freeway6 at T26: safe? as above, [7,18] -> safe)\n   T26: y=6 -> U -> T27: y=7 (freeway7: always safe? as above)\n\nNow at T27: y=7. We want to go to y=8 and then to y=9. But we cannot be at y=8 at T28, T29, T30. \n\nSo we must wait at y=7 until T30? Then at T30: we go U -> T31: y=8 (safe? at T31: freeway8: [1,12] -> safe). Then at T31: U -> T32: y=9.\n\nBut that means we stay at y=7 for 3 turns: T27, T28, T29? \n\nSo the entire sequence:\n\n  T19: U -> y=3\n  T20: U -> y=4\n  T21: U -> y=5\n  T22: D -> y=4   (to avoid being at y=5 at T23? actually we are at T22: y=5, then we move down so at T23 we are at y=4)\n  T23: S -> y=4   (we stay to avoid going to y=5 at T24? because if we go up at T23 we get to y=5 at T24 -> dangerous)\n  T24: S -> y=4? Actually, at T23 we are at y=4, then we do S -> so T24: y=4. But we want to go to y=5 at T25? so at T24 we must go up? \n        But if at T24 we go up, then at T25 we are at y=5? which is safe? \n        So we don't need to stay twice? \n\n  Correction: \n        T22: D -> at T23: y=4\n        T23: we can do S? but then T24: y=4. Then at T24: U -> T25: y=5 (safe).\n\n  Alternatively, we can do at T23: U? \n        But that would lead to T24: y=5 -> which is dangerous? so we cannot.\n\n  So we must do at T23: S? then T24: y=4 -> then T24: U -> T25: y=5.\n\n  Then:\n        T25: U -> T26: y=6 (safe at T26: freeway6: [7,18] -> safe)\n        T26: U -> T27: y=7\n\n  Now at T27: we are at y=7. We need to get to y=8 and then y=9. But we cannot be at y=8 at T28, T29, T30. \n        So we can stay at y=7 at T27, T28, T29? Then at T30: U -> T31: y=8 (safe) and then T31: U -> T32: y=9.\n\n  But wait: at T27 we are at y=7. Then:\n        T27: S -> T28: y=7 (safe)\n        T28: S -> T29: y=7 (safe)\n        T29: S -> T30: y=7? Then we haven't moved. Actually, we want to move at T30: \n              T30: U -> T31: y=8 (safe)\n        T31: U -> T32: y=9.\n\n  So the moves:\n\n      T19: U\n      T20: U\n      T21: U\n      T22: D\n      T23: S\n      T24: U\n      T25: U\n      T26: U\n      T27: S\n      T28: S\n      T29: S\n      T30: U\n      T31: U\n\n  Total turns: from T19 to T31? That's 12 moves? But we start at T19 and the actions are from T19 to T31? That is 13 actions? \n\n  Actually, the sequence of actions is for t from t1 to t1+H-1, and H is the number of actions? and after H actions we are at the goal at turn t1+H.\n\n  But note: we start at turn19, and we take an action at turn19 to move to turn20. Then the state at turn20 is after the first action.\n\n  We are to reach (0,9) at turn19+H-1? Actually, the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and then we have y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\n  How the state evolves:\n      At turn19: we are at y19=2.\n      Then we take action a19 at turn19 -> then at the next turn (turn20) we are at y20 = y19 + delta(a19).\n\n      So after H actions (taken at turns19, 20, ... , 19+H-1), we are at turn19+H, and the position is y_{19+H} = ... \n\n  But the problem says: \"such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\n  Let me read: \n      \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" -> so t=0 to H-1: that is a_{t1}, a_{t1+1}, ..., a_{t1+H-1}.\n      Then the state after these actions? \n\n      The update: \n          y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + delta(a_{t1})\n          y_{t1+2} = y_{t1+1} + delta(a_{t1+1})\n          ...\n          y_{t1+H} = y_{t1+H-1} + delta(a_{t1+H-1})\n\n      But the problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\". \n\n      This implies that we are at 9 at the turn t1+H-1? \n\n      But note: at the start of the game at turn t1, we are at (0,y_{t1}). Then we take an action at turn t1, which leads to y_{t1+1}. So the state y_t is at the beginning of turn t? Or at the end?\n\n      The problem states: \"at turn T, the player is on freeway y_T\". \n\n      And the collision condition is at turn T: if the player is on freeway y_T and 0 is in the car span at turn T.\n\n      So we are concerned with the state at the beginning of each turn? \n\n      Actually, the problem says: \"the current turn is t1\" and we are given the initial position (0,y_{t1}) at turn t1.\n\n      Then we take an action a_{t1} at turn t1, which leads to y_{t1+1} at turn t1+1.\n\n      So at turn t1, we are at y_{t1} (which is given as 2). Then we take action a_{t1} -> then at turn t1+1, we are at y_{t1+1}.\n\n      Therefore, the state y_t is the state at the beginning of turn t.\n\n      So we require that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at y_{t1+H-1}=9? \n\n      But that would mean we have not taken an action at turn t1+H-1? Then how did we get to 9? \n\n      Actually, the goal is to reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1? \n\n      But note: the sequence of actions has H actions: from a_{t1} to a_{t1+H-1}. Then the last action is taken at turn t1+H-1, which leads to y_{t1+H}? \n\n      However, the problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\". \n\n      This seems inconsistent.\n\n      Let me reread: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions ... to reach (0,9)\".\n\n      And the answer format: \n          Turn t1: a_{t1}\n          Turn t1+1: a_{t1+1}\n          ...\n          Turn t1+H-1: a_{t1+H-1}\n\n      And we require that after these actions, we are at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1? \n\n      But note: after taking the last action a_{t1+H-1} at turn t1+H-1, the next state is at turn t1+H. So we would be at (0,9) at turn t1+H? \n\n      The problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\". \n\n      This is confusing.\n\n      Looking back: \"such that y_{t1+H-1} = 9\". \n\n      But at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at y_{t1+H-1}. Then we take action a_{t1+H-1} and move to y_{t1+H} = y_{t1+H-1} + delta(a_{t1+H-1}).\n\n      For us to be at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, that means we achieved 9 without taking the action at that turn? Then why take the action? \n\n      Alternatively, the problem might mean that we are at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H? \n\n      But the problem states: y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\n      Let me check the problem statement again: \n          \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9), ... such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\"\n\n      This suggests that we are at y=9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1. \n\n      Then the last action in the sequence is taken at turn t1+H-1? But then after that action, we move to y_{t1+H} which is not 9? \n\n      This doesn't make sense.\n\n      Alternatively, perhaps the state y_t is the state after the action of turn t-1? \n\n      The problem says: \"Player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + ... \"\n\n      And the initial state is at turn t1: y_{t1} = 2.\n\n      Then at turn t1, we take action a_{t1} -> then y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + delta(a_{t1}).\n\n      So the state y_t is at the beginning of turn t? \n\n      Then to be at y_{t1+H-1}=9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we must have taken H-1 actions? \n\n      But the sequence of actions is from t1 to t1+H-1: that is H actions? \n\n      This does not match.\n\n      Let me assume the sequence of actions is for the turns: t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1 (H actions). Then the state after these actions is at turn t1+H? \n\n      But the problem states: y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\n      There is a discrepancy.\n\n      Looking at the example in the problem: \n          \"Given the initial position (0, y_{t1})\" and then the update is y_{t+1} = y_t + ... \n\n      So at turn t1, we are at y_{t1}. Then after the action at turn t1, we are at y_{t1+1}. \n\n      Therefore, at the beginning of turn t1, we are at y_{t1}. \n      At the beginning of turn t1+1, we are at y_{t1+1}.\n\n      We want to be at y_{???}=9.\n\n      The problem says: \"such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\".\n\n      So we want at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 to be at 9.\n\n      How many actions have been taken to get there? \n          We started at turn t1 (state y_{t1}) and then we take actions at turn t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-2? \n          That is H-1 actions? \n\n      But the sequence of actions is defined for t=0 to H-1: that is a_{t1} to a_{t1+H-1}. \n\n      This would be H actions, leading to state at turn t1+H? \n\n      The problem says: \"the sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and then y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\n      This implies that the last action is taken at turn t1+H-1, and after taking that action, the state becomes y_{t1+H}? \n\n      But then we are at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H? \n\n      Why does it say y_{t1+H-1}=9?\n\n      This is a critical issue.\n\n      Let me read carefully: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions ... \"\n\n      Here, H is the minimal number of turns? \n\n      And then the sequence is from t1 to t1+H-1? \n\n      And then we are to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1? \n\n      But that would mean we are at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1? \n\n      Then the action at turn t1+H-1 is taken when we are already at 9? \n\n      And then after that action, we might move away? \n\n      That doesn't make sense.\n\n      Alternatively, perhaps the problem means that after the entire sequence, we are at 9 at the next turn? \n\n      But the problem explicitly says: y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\n      Given the confusion, I will assume that the goal is to have the player at (0,9) at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, and this is achieved by taking actions from turn t1 to turn t1+H-2? That is, the sequence of actions has length H-1? \n\n      But the problem says the sequence is {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} -> that is H actions.\n\n      This is very confusing.\n\n      Let me try to interpret from the example: \n          Suppose we start at y2 at turn19. We want to get to y9. \n          The minimal moves without obstacles is 7 moves (U seven times). \n          Then we would be at y9 at turn19+7 = turn26? \n          But after the seventh action at turn25, we get to y26 = 9? \n          So at the beginning of turn26, we are at y26=9. \n\n          Therefore, we want y_{t1+H-1} = 9? \n          Here, t1=19, so we want y_{19+H-1}=9.\n\n          In the minimal case, 19+H-1 = 26? -> H-1=7? so H=8.\n\n          But then the sequence of actions would be from turn19 to turn19+7 (which is turn26-1=25)? That is 8 actions? But we only need 7 actions to move up 7 times.\n\n      Alternatively, if we take 7 actions (from turn19 to turn25), then at the beginning of turn26 we are at y26=9. \n          So we want y_{19+7}=9? then we would set H-1=7? so H=8? then the sequence has 8 actions? but we only have 7.\n\n      This doesn't match.\n\n      Another possibility: the sequence of actions is for the turns that we take action, and the state after the action is the next turn. And we want the last state to be at (0,9) at the turn after the last action? \n\n      The problem says: y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\n      If we take actions at turns19,20,...,19+k-1, then the state at turn19+k is y_{19+k}. \n      We want y_{19+k}=9. \n      Then we set k = H-1? -> so the number of actions is k = H-1, and the last state is at turn19+k = 19+H-1.\n\n      Then the sequence of actions has H-1 actions? \n      But the problem says: the sequence is {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} -> which is H actions.\n\n      This also doesn't match.\n\n      Given the time, I will assume that the sequence of actions is a_{t1}, a_{t1+1}, ..., a_{t1+H-1} (H actions) and that after these actions, the player is at (0,9) at the beginning of turn t1+H.\n\n      This means that the last action a_{t1+H-1} is taken at turn t1+H-1, and then at turn t1+H, the player is at y_{t1+H}=9.\n\n      Therefore, we require y_{t1+H}=9.\n\n      But the problem says: \"such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\n      So there is a conflict.\n\n      However, in the answer format, it lists actions from turn t1 to turn t1+H-1. \n\n      And then we are at y_{t1+H-1}=9? \n\n      But then why take the action at turn t1+H-1? \n\n      I think there might be a misstatement in the problem.\n\n      Let me look at the update rule: \n          y_{t+1} = y_t + ... \n      and the initial state is at turn t1: y_{t1} = given.\n\n      The goal is to reach (0,9) at some turn. \n\n      The problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\".\n\n      Perhaps it means that after taking the action at turn t1+H-1, we are at 9? but then that would be y_{t1+H} = 9.\n\n      But they write y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\n      Given the confusion, I will output the actions that get us to y=9 at turn t1+H, and then we can adjust the answer to meet the format.\n\n      But the format requires that the last action is at turn t1+H-1 and then we are at y_{t1+H-1}=9. \n\n      This is only possible if the last action is S and we are already at 9? \n\n      For example, if we are at y=9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, and then we take action S, then we stay at 9. \n\n      So then we are at y_{t1+H-1}=9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, and then we take S and remain at 9 for turn t1+H.\n\n      But the problem doesn't require to be at 9 at turn t1+H, only at turn t1+H-1.\n\n      So we can be at 9 at turn t1+H-1 (beginning) and then take any action? but then we might move away? \n\n      However, the goal is to reach (0,9) and then presumably we stop? \n\n      But the problem doesn't specify that we have to stay there. \n\n      So it might be that we only require to be at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, and then we take an action that might move us away? \n\n      That doesn't make sense for a goal.\n\n      Given the ambiguity, I will assume that we must be at (0,9) at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, and then the last action is taken at turn t1+H-1, and it can be any action, but we are already at 9 so if we choose S, we stay.\n\n      But then why take the action? \n\n      Alternatively, the sequence of actions should be until we reach 9, and the last action is the one that brings us to 9 at the next turn. But then we are at 9 at turn t1+H-1+1 = t1+H.\n\n      And then we would set the sequence to have actions from t1 to t1+H-1 (H actions) and then at turn t1+H we are at 9.\n\n      But the problem says explicitly: y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\n      I think there is a mistake in the problem statement.\n\n      To resolve, I will assume that the intended meaning is: \n          We are to find a sequence of actions of length H (actions at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1) such that after taking these actions, the player is at (0,9) at the next turn, i.e., at turn t1+H.\n\n      Then we require y_{t1+H}=9.\n\n      And then the answer format lists actions for turns t1 to t1+H-1.\n\n      But the problem says: y_{t1+H-}=9.\n\n      However, in the minimal solution without obstacles, we would do:\n          a19=U, a20=U, ..., a24=U (6 actions) -> then at turn25 (which is 19+6) we are at y25=2+6=8? \n          then a25=U: turn25 action U -> turn26: y26=9.\n\n          So then we would have actions from turn19 to turn25 (7 actions) and then at turn26 we are at 9.\n\n          Therefore, H=7 actions, and we are at 9 at turn19+7=26.\n\n          So then we want y_{19+7}=y26=9.\n\n          In the problem's requirement: they want y_{t1+H-1}=y_{19+6}=y25=8, not 9.\n\n      This does not meet.\n\n      If we do 7 actions and are at turn26 at 9, then the problem would require to output actions for turns19 to 25, and then state that at turn25 (H-1=6) we are at 9? but we are at 8 at turn25.\n\n      Therefore, I think the problem means that the last action brings us to 9 at the next turn, but then they want to call H the number of actions, and then at turn t1+H we are at 9, and then the last action is at turn t1+H-1.\n\n      And the format lists actions for turns t1 to t1+H-1.\n\n      So in the example: H=7 actions, turns19 to 25, and then at turn26 we are at 9.\n\n      But the problem says: \"y_{t1+H-}=9\" -> they would have to say y_{t1+H}=9.\n\n      Given the time, I will output the actions that bring us to 9 at turn t1+H, and then in the answer, we list actions for turns t1 to t1+H-1, and we state H as the number of actions.\n\n      But the problem asks for the minimal number of turns H and the sequence.\n\n      In this interpretation, H is the number of actions, and the total turns elapsed from the start to the turn we reach 9 is H turns? no, we reach at turn t1+H.\n\n      So the number of turns from the current turn (turn19) to the turn we reach (turn19+H) is H turns? but we are not counting the current turn as spent? \n\n      Anyway, let's proceed with the plan.\n\n      We want to reach y=9 at some turn T>=19.\n\n      We have a candidate sequence that uses 12 actions? \n          actions at turn19 to turn30 -> 12 actions? \n          then at turn31 we are at y=9? \n          wait, let's recount with the correct state evolution.\n\n      Let me simulate carefully from turn19 to turn31, with the actions we planned:\n\n        Turn19: start at y=2. \n        a19=U -> turn20: y=3\n        a20=U -> turn21: y=4\n        a21=U -> turn22: y=5\n        a22=D -> turn23: y=4\n        a23=S -> turn24: y=4  [because S: no change]\n        a24=U -> turn25: y=5\n        a25=U -> turn26: y=6\n        a26=U -> turn27: y=7\n        a27=S -> turn28: y=7\n        a28=S -> turn29: y=7\n        a29=S -> turn30: y=7\n        a30=U -> turn31: y=8\n        a31=U -> turn32: y=9   <--- goal at turn32.\n\n      So we need actions from turn19 to turn31: that's 13 actions.\n\n      But is there a shorter sequence?\n\n      We are delayed by the dangerous times.\n\n      We must avoid:\n        - freeway5 and freeway6 at turns23 and24.\n        - freeway8 at turns28,29,30.\n\n      The ideal path would be to go from y=2 to y=7 as fast as possible (5 moves: U five times would get to y=7 in 5 actions: turn19 to turn24: \n          turn19: U ->20:3\n          turn20: U ->21:4\n          turn21: U ->22:5\n          turn22: U ->23:6\n          turn23: U ->24:7\n\n      But at turn23: we are at freeway6? -> dangerous because at turn23, freeway6 has a car covering 0? -> collision.\n\n      So we cannot be at y=6 at turn23.\n\n      Similarly, at turn24: we would be at y=7? but freeway7 is safe. \n\n      So if we can avoid being at y=5 or y=6 at turn23 and turn24, and also avoid being at y=8 at turn28,29,30.\n\n      What if we slow down in the middle to avoid being at y=6 at turn23? \n\n      For example, \n        turn19: U ->20:3\n        turn20: U ->21:4\n        turn21: S ->22:4  [wait at y=4 for one turn]\n        turn22: U ->23:5   -> but at turn23, freeway5 is dangerous? -> collision.\n\n      So we cannot be at y=5 at turn23.\n\n      Alternatively, \n        turn19: U ->20:3\n        turn20: U ->21:4\n        turn21: U ->22:5\n        turn22: S ->23:5   -> collision at turn23 on freeway5.\n\n      So we must leave freeway5 and freeway6 before turn23.\n\n      The only option is to go down to y=4 at turn23.\n\n      So we do:\n        turn19: U ->20:3\n        turn20: U ->21:4\n        turn21: U ->22:5\n        turn22: D ->23:4   (safe)\n\n      Then at turn23: we are at y=4. \n        We cannot go up at turn23 because that would put us at y=5 at turn24, which is dangerous.\n        So we must stay or go down. \n        If we go down to y=3, then we are safe? freeway3 at turn24: \n              car: (60,25,right,36) at turn24: dt=5 -> [25+36*5, 60+36*5] = [25+180, 60+180] = [205,240] -> safe.\n        But then we are at y=3, and we need to go up to y=9 -> that will take more moves.\n\n      Alternatively, we can stay at y=4 at turn23 and turn24? \n        turn23: S ->24:4 (safe, freeway4 at turn24: [25+36*5, 60+36*5]=[205,240] -> safe)\n\n        then turn24: U ->25:5 (safe, because freeway5 at turn25: car1: [ -35+6*(25-19)= -35+36=1, -24+36=12] = [1,12] -> safe)\n\n        then turn25: U ->26:6 (freeway6 at turn26: [ -35+6*(26-19)= -35+42=7, -24+42=18] = [7,18] -> safe)\n        turn26: U ->27:7 (safe)\n        turn27: we are at y=7. \n\n        Now we need to go to y=8 and then to y=9. \n        But freeway8 is dangerous at turn28,29,30. \n        We can try to go to y=8 at turn27?

\n\n      Note that at turn26 we are at y=6. We then go to y=7 at turn27. \n        turn27: we are at y=7. \n\n        We have to wait at y=7 for three turns (27,28,29) and then go to y=8 at turn30 (arrive at turn31) and then to y=9 at turn32.\n\n        Is there a way to go to y=8 at an earlier safe turn? \n\n        The next safe turn for freeway8 is turn31 (dt=12: [1,12] safe). \n\n        But is there a turn before turn31 that is safe for freeway8? \n            turn28: dt=9: [-11,0] -> dangerous\n            turn29: dt=10: [-7,4] -> dangerous\n            turn30: dt=11: [-3,8] -> dangerous\n            turn31: safe.\n\n        So we must wait until turn30 to leave y=7, then turn31: at y=8, and turn32: at y=9.\n\n        So we cannot save turns there.\n\n      What about the first part? \n\n        We are forced to go down to y=4 at turn23, and then wait at turn23 and/or turn24? \n\n        In the above, we did:\n           turn22: D ->23:4\n           turn23: S ->24:4\n           turn24: U ->25:5\n\n        Can we do turn23: U to go to y=5 at turn24? -> but turn24 is dangerous for freeway5.\n\n        turn23: D ->24:3? \n           then turn24: U ->25:4\n           turn25: U ->26:5 (freeway5 at turn26: safe? car1 at freeway5: [ -35+6*(26-19)= -35+42=7, -24+42=18] -> [7,18] -> safe)\n           turn26: U ->27:6 (freeway6: same calculation -> safe)\n           turn27: U ->28:7 (safe)\n           then we are at y=7 at turn28. \n\n           Now we have to wait at y=7 for three turns: turn28,29,30 -> then turn31: y=8, turn32: y=9.\n\n           Actions: \n              19:U,20:U,21:U,22:D,23:D,24:U,25:U,26:U,27:U,28:S,29:S,30:S,31:U,32:U -> \n\n           This is 14 actions? \n\n        Worse.\n\n      Alternatively, at turn23: we are at y=4. \n           turn23: U ->24:5 (dangerous) -> not allowed.\n\n      So we must do turn23: S or D. We did S in the first plan.\n\n      But notice that at turn24, freeway5 is dangerous, but freeway6 is also dangerous? \n        freeway6 at turn24: car1: [-35+6*5, -24+30] = [-35+30, 6] = [-5,6] -> includes 0 -> dangerous.\n\n      So we cannot be at any of these freeways.\n\n      Therefore, we must be at y<=4 or y>=7 at turn24. \n\n      But we are at y=4 at turn24.\n\n      So safe.\n\n      Then we have to go up from there.\n\n      So the first plan is better.\n\n      Another idea: can we speed up by going to y=7 faster after turn24? \n\n        turn24: at y=4, we go up: turn25: y=5 (safe), turn26: y=6 (safe), turn27: y=7.\n\n        That's three moves: same as before.\n\n      Then at turn27: we are at y=7. \n\n      We have to wait until turn30 to move to y=8? \n\n      total actions: \n         19,20,21: U -> three moves\n         22: D\n         23: S\n         24: U\n         25: U\n         26: U\n         27: S\n         28: S\n         29: S\n         30: U\n         31: U  -> 12 actions? \n\n      Let count the turns: \n         actions at turn19 to turn31: that's 13 actions? because inclusive 19 to 31 is 31-19+1=13 actions.\n\n      But in the plan above, we have 12 actions listed? \n\n      Actually, the actions are for turn19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31 -> 13 actions.\n\n      The last action at turn31: U -> then turn32: y=9.\n\n      So we reach at turn32.\n\n      The minimal possible without obstacles is 7 actions (7 ups) to reach at turn26.\n\n      But we have to take 13 actions.\n\n      Is there a shorter path? \n\n      What if we try to be at y=7 at an earlier turn and then wait? \n\n      The earliest we can be at y=7 is turn24: \n          turn19: U->20:3\n          turn20: U->21:4\n          turn21: U->22:5\n          turn22: we cannot go to y=6 at turn23 because dangerous.\n          turn22: D->23:4\n          turn23: U->24:5 -> dangerous at turn24 for freeway5.\n\n      Alternatively, \n          turn19: U->20:3\n          turn20: U->21:4\n          turn21: S->22:4\n          turn22: U->23:5 -> dangerous.\n\n      Or,\n          turn19: U->20:3\n          turn20: U->21:4\n          turn21: U->22:5\n          turn22: we could do a double down? \n                turn22: D->23:4\n                turn23: D->24:3\n          then turn24: U->25:4\n          turn25: U->26:5 (safe)\n          turn26: U->27:6 (safe)\n          turn27: U->28:7\n          then we are at y=7 at turn28. \n          Then we have to wait at y=7 for turns28,29,30 -> then turn31: to y=8, turn32: to y=9.\n          Actions: 19:U,20:U,21:U,22:D,23:D,24:U,25:U,26:U,27:U,28:S,29:S,30:S,31:U,32:U -> 14 actions.\n\n      Not better.\n\n      Another idea: can we use y=0 or y=9 as safe havens? \n         But y=0 and y=9 have no cars. \n         But to go to y=0 from y=2: that would be moving down, which is away from the goal.\n\n      We might go to y=9 as soon as possible, but we have to go through the dangerous freeways.\n\n      Given the constraints, the first plan with 13 actions seems necessary.\n\n      But note: at turn27 we are at y=7. The dangerous period for freeway8 is turns28,29,30. \n        turn31 is safe. \n\n        So we can leave y=7 at turn30: \n             turn30: U -> turn31: y=8 (safe)\n             turn31: U -> turn32: y=9\n\n        So we must be at y=7 from turn27 to turn30? \n\n        But at turn27: we arrive at y=7.\n        Then we are at y=7 for turns27,28,29: that is, we take actions at turn27,28,29 to stay at y=7.\n\n        So actions at turn27:S, turn28:S, turn29:S.\n\n        Then turn30:U.\n\n        Then turn31:U.\n\n        total actions from turn19 to turn31: 13 actions.\n\n      Therefore, the sequence is:\n\n        Turn 19: U\n        Turn 20: U\n        Turn 21: U\n        Turn 22: D\n        Turn 23: S\n        Turn 24: U\n        Turn 25: U\n        Turn 26: U\n        Turn 27: S\n        Turn 28: S\n        Turn 29: S\n        Turn 30: U\n        Turn 31: U\n\n      And then at turn32 we are at y=9.\n\n      But the problem asks for the sequence until we reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1? \n\n      In this plan, at turn31 we are at y=8, and then after action U at turn31, we are at y=9 at turn32.\n\n      So we are at (0,9) at turn32 = 19+13.\n\n      The problem says: at turn t1+H-1 we are at (0,9). \n\n      Here, t1=19, and we want turn19+H-1 = 32? -> H-1 = 13? -> H=14.\n\n      But then the sequence would have to be for turns19 to 19+13 = turn32? \n\n      This is not matching.\n\n      Alternatively, if we output only up to turn31, then at turn31 we are at y=8, not 9.\n\n      To be at y=9 at turn32, we must include the action at turn31.\n\n      The problem might consider the turns spent: from turn19 to turn32 is 14 turns? but we only take actions at turns19 to31: that's 13 actions.\n\n      Given the answer format, we must output actions for turns19 to 19+H-1.\n\n      If we let H=14, then the sequence is for turns19 to 19+13=32? -> but turn32 is beyond the last action turn31.\n\n      This is very confusing.\n\n      I think the problem means that the sequence of actions is for turns t1 to t1+H-1, and after taking these actions, the next state (at turn t1+H) is at (0,9). \n\n      Then we have taken H actions, and the state at turn t1+H is 9.\n\n      Then in our case, we need to output actions for turns19 to 19+H-1, and then at turn19+H we are at 9.\n\n      For our plan, we are at 9 at turn32 = 19+13. \n          So 19+H = 32 -> H=13.\n\n      Therefore, the sequence has 13 actions: turns19 to 31.\n\n      So the answer should be:\n\n        Turn 19: U\n        Turn 20: U\n        Turn 21: U\n        Turn 22: D\n        Turn 23: S\n        Turn 24: U\n        Turn 25: U\n        Turn 26: U\n        Turn 27: S\n        Turn 28: S\n        Turn 29: S\n        Turn 30: U\n        Turn 31: U\n\n      And H=13.\n\n      Then in the boxed answer, we list these.\n\n      But the problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\n      In our case, at turn19+12=31, we are at y=8 (because at the beginning of turn31, before the action, we are at y=8? -> no, let's see:\n\n        At turn31: we are at the beginning at y=8 (because at turn30 we did U and that moved us from y=7 at turn30 to y=8 at turn31).\n        Then we take action a31=U -> then at turn32: y=9.\n\n        So at turn31 (which is t1+12), we are at y=8, not 9.\n\n      Therefore, it does not meet the requirement.\n\n      To have y_{t1+H-1}=9, we must be at 9 at the beginning of turn19+H-1.\n\n      In our simulation, when would that be? \n\n        We are at y=9 at turn32 = 19+13.\n\n        So to be at y=9 at the beginning of turn32, we must have gotten there by the action at turn31. \n\n        So we are at 9 at turn32 = t1+13.\n\n        So we require: t1+H-1 = 19+13 = 32 -> H-1=13 -> H=14.\n\n        Then the sequence should be for turns19 to 19+13=32? -> but we only have actions up to turn31.\n\n        The last action in the sequence would be at turn32? and then we are at 9 at turn32? \n\n        But how can we take an action at turn32 if we are already at 9? \n\n        We would take action S at turn32 to stay at 9.\n\n        Then the sequence would be 14 actions: \n             turns19 to 32.\n\n        But then the state at turn32: we are at y=9 at the beginning. Then we take action a32=S -> and then at turn33: still at 9.\n\n        But the requirement is to be at 9 at the beginning of turn32.\n\n        So the action at turn32 is not necessary for reaching 9, but for the sequence length.\n\n        Therefore, we add a32=S.\n\n        But then we are at 9 at turn32, and then we do a32=S -> then at turn33: we are still at 9, but we don't care.\n\n        The requirement is only to reach 9 at turn32.\n\n        So the sequence:\n\n          Turn19: U\n          Turn20: U\n          Turn21: U\n          Turn22: D\n          Turn23: S\n          Turn24: U\n          Turn25: U\n          Turn26: U\n          Turn27: S\n          Turn28: S\n          Turn29: S\n          Turn30: U\n          Turn31: U\n          Turn32: S    # to stay at 9\n\n        This meets that at the beginning of turn32, we are at y=9.\n\n        And then we take action S at turn32, and we are still at 9 at turn33.\n\n        The sequence has 14 actions.\n\n        And we are at y_{19+13}=y_{32}=9 at the beginning of turn32.\n\n        Therefore, H=14.\n\n      But is this minimal? \n\n        We could have reached at turn32 with a different sequence of 14 actions? \n\n        But note that without the extra S at the end, we reached at turn32 after 13 actions. \n        However, the problem requires that the last state in the sequence is at turn32 (H-1=13 -> turn32 is the last action turn) and we are at 9 at the beginning of turn32.\n\n        In the 13-action sequence, we were at 9 at turn32 but that was after the action of turn31, so at the beginning of turn32 we were at 8, and then after action at turn31 we were at 9 at turn32.\n\n        But the state at the beginning of turn32 is 8, not 9.\n\n        To have the beginning of turn32 be 9, we must have gotten there by the action at turn31. \n\n        So the 13-action sequence does not have the property that at the beginning of turn32 we are at 9.\n\n        Therefore, we must include the action at turn32 to have the sequence cover until turn32, but then we need an extra action.\n\n        However, the action at turn32 is not necessary for reaching 9, only for meeting the output requirement.\n\n        Alternatively, we can reach 9 at an earlier turn? \n\n        The earliest we can be at 9 is turn26 if no obstacles, but we have to avoid, and we couldn't.\n\n        The next chance is turn32.\n\n        So we must be at 9 at turn32.\n\n        Therefore, the minimal H is 14.\n\n        The sequence has 14 actions.\n\n      Let me recap with the corrected timeline for the 14-action sequence:\n\n        Turn19: start y=2.\n        a19=U -> at turn20: y=3.\n        a20=U -> at turn21: y=4.\n        a21=U -> at turn22: y=5.\n        a22=D -> at turn23: y=4.\n        a23=S -> at turn24: y=4.\n        a24=U -> at turn25: y=5.\n        a25=U -> at turn26: y=6.\n        a26=U -> at turn27: y=7.\n        a27=S -> at turn28: y=7.\n        a28=S -> at turn29: y=7.\n        a29=S -> at turn30: y=7.\n        a30=U -> at turn31: y=8.\n        a31=U -> at turn32: y=9.   [So at the beginning of turn32, we are at y=9? no, we are at y=9 at turn32 AFTER the action of turn31. \n        But at the beginning of turn32, we are at y=8!]\n\n        This is the problem.\n\n      How can we be at y=9 at the beginning of turn32? \n\n        We would need to have moved to y=9 at the action of turn31, so that at the beginning of turn32 we are at y=9.\n\n        In the above, at the action of turn31: we are at y=8 at the beginning of turn31, and we do U -> then at turn32: y=9.\n\n        So at the beginning of turn32: we are at y=9.\n\n        Therefore, we are at y=9 at the beginning of turn32.\n\n        So then we don't need an extra action? \n\n        The sequence of 13 actions (from turn19 to turn31) already ensures that at the beginning of turn32 we are at y=9.\n\n        Then why do we need an action at turn32? \n\n        The problem asks for the sequence until turn31 (because t1+H-1 = 19+13-1=31) and then we are at y_{31}=? \n\n        At the beginning of turn31, we are at y=8.\n\n        The problem requires: such that at turn t1+H-1 we are at 9. \n\n        Here, at turn31 (19+13-1=31) we are at 8, not 9.\n\n        So it does not meet.\n\n      To have at turn31 ( which would be t1+H-1) we are at 9, we would have to be at 9 at the beginning of turn31.\n\n      How to achieve that? \n\n        We would need to be at 9 at turn31.\n        That means we must have taken an action at turn30 that moved us from y=8 to y=9? \n        But then we would be at y=9 at turn31.\n\n        So then the last action is at turn30: U, and then at turn31: y=9.\n\n        So we require H-1 = 30-19 = 11? -> H=12.\n\n        Then the sequence has 12 actions: turn19 to turn30.\n\n        And we are at y_{19+12-1}=y_30=? \n           at the beginning of turn30: we are at y=7 (because at turn29: we are at y=7, and we take action a29=U at turn29 -> then at turn30: y=8? not 9)\n\n        To be at y=9 at the beginning of turn31, we must have done two ups in one action? not possible.\n\n        Alternatively, we must be at y=9 at the beginning of turn31 by having moved there from turn30.\n\n        So the action at turn30 must be U and we must be at y=8 at turn30 so that U moves us to y=9 at turn31.\n\n        Then at the beginning of turn31: we are at y=9.\n\n        So then the last action is at turn30: U.\n\n        In our simulation, can we be at y=8 at turn30? \n           turn30: y=8 -> freeway8 at turn30: dangerous? as above, [-3,8] -> includes 0 -> collision.\n\n        Therefore, we cannot be at y=8 at turn30.\n\n        We can only be at y=8 at turn31: which is safe.\n\n        So we cannot be at y=8 at turn30.\n\n      Therefore, it is impossible to be at y=9 at the beginning of turn31.\n\n      The earliest we can be at y=9 is turn32, and that requires being at y=8 at turn31 ( safe).\n\n      So to have y_{t1+H-1}=9, we need to be at 9 at turn t1+H-1 =32-1=31? \n          -> then we need to be at 9 at turn31.\n\n      But we cannot be at 9 at turn31 because we can only be at y=8 at turn31 ( safe) and then we can move to 9 at turn32.\n\n      We could try to be at 9 earlier? \n\n        turn32 is the earliest safe arrival at y=9.\n\n      Given the above, I think the problem likely has a typo and means that we are to be at (0,9) at the turn after the last action, i.e., turn t1+H.\n\n      In that case, we output the 13-action sequence and state that we are at 9 at turn32.\n\n      But the problem specifically says: y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\n      Since we are at 9 at turn32 = t1+13, then we would put H-1=13 -> H=14, and then the sequence has to include an action at turn32, even though we are already at 9.\n\n      So the only way to meet the requirement is to output 14 actions, with the last action at turn32 being a 'S' (stay) at y=9.\n\n      Therefore, the sequence is 14 actions: turns19 to 32.\n\n      Actions:\n        Turn19: U\n        Turn20: U\n        Turn21: U\n        Turn22: D\n        Turn23: S\n        Turn24: U\n        Turn25: U\n        Turn26: U\n        Turn27: S\n        Turn28: S\n        Turn29: S\n        Turn30: U\n        Turn31: U  -> at turn32: y=9\n        Turn32: S  -> to stay at 9\n\n      Then at the beginning of turn32, we are at y=9 ( because the action at turn31 moved us to 9 at turn32), and then we take action S at turn32 and remain at 9 for turn33.\n\n      The problem requires only to reach (0,9) at turn32, and we are at 9 at the beginning of turn32.\n\n      Then the last action (Turn32: S) is taken when we are at 9.\n\n      This meets: at turn32 ( which is t1+14-1 = 19+13=32) we are at y=9.\n\n      Therefore, H=14.\n\n      So the answer is 14 actions.\n\n      But is this minimal? We have to do at least 7 moves up, and we had to wait 5 times ( one S at turn23, three at turns27-29, and one extra at the end) -> 7 ups + 5 waits + 1 down = 13 actions, and then one extra action at the end -> 14.\n\n      The down and the wait in the middle are necessary to avoid collisions.\n\n      Therefore, it is minimal.\n\n      So the final answer in the boxed format:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 19: U\nTurn 20: U\nTurn 21: U\nTurn 22: D\nTurn 23: S\nTurn 24: U\nTurn 25: U\nTurn 26: U\nTurn 27: S\nTurn 28: S\nTurn 29: S\nTurn 30: U\nTurn 31: U\nTurn 32: S\n}\n\n      But wait, the current turn is t1=19, and the turns go to 32, which is 14 actions.\n\n      Note: the problem might interpret the turns as the action turn, and the state at the next turn.\n\n      Given the problem's requirement, we output this.\n\n      However, let me verify collision at each turn for the state at the beginning of the turn:\n\n        Turn19: y=2 -> freeway2: safe (car at [25,60] -> safe)\n        Turn20: y=3 -> freeway3: car at [25+36=61, 60+36=96] -> safe\n        Turn21: y=4 -> freeway4: [25+72=97, 60+72=132] -> safe\n        Turn22: y=5 -> freeway5: \n                car1: [-35+6*3=-35+18=-17, -24+18=-6] -> safe\n                car2: [43+18=61,54+18=72] -> safe\n                car3: [7+18=25,18+18=36] -> safe\n        Turn23: y=4 -> freeway4: [25+36*4=25+144=169, 60+144=204] -> safe\n        Turn24: y=4 -> freeway4: [25+36*5=205, 60+180=240] -> safe\n        Turn25: y=5 -> freeway5: car1:[-35+6*6=-35+36=1, -24+36=12] -> safe (0 not in [1,12])\n        Turn26: y=6 -> freeway6: car1:[-35+6*7=7, -24+42=18] -> safe\n        Turn27: y=7 -> freeway7: [1+12*8=97, 12+96=108] -> safe\n        Turn28: y=7 -> freeway7: [1+12*9=109, 12+108=120] -> safe\n        Turn29: y=7 -> freeway7: [1+12*10=121, 12+120=132] -> safe\n        Turn30: y=7 -> freeway7: [1+12*11=133, 12+132=144] -> safe\n        Turn31: y=8 -> freeway8: car1:[-47+4*12=-47+48=1, -36+48=12] -> safe\n        Turn32: y=9 -> no freeway, safe.\n\n      Note: at the beginning of each turn, we are at the stated y.\n\n      We don't check collision for y=9.\n\n      The actions taken are for the turn and then the state changes to the next turn.\n\n      So the above is safe.\n\n      Therefore, the answer is the 14 actions as above.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 2)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 19\\) is 14, with the sequence of actions as follows:\n\n- At turn 19, move up (U) to position \\((0, 3)\\) at turn 20.\n- At turn 20, move up (U) to position \\((0, 4)\\) at turn 21.\n- At turn 21, move up (U) to position \\((0, 5)\\) at turn 22.\n- At turn 22, move down (D) to avoid collision on freeway 5 at turn 23, reaching \\((0, 4)\\) at turn 23.\n- At turn 23, stay (S) to avoid moving to a dangerous freeway at turn 24, remaining at \\((0, 4)\\) at turn 24.\n- At turn 24, move up (U) to position \\((0, 5)\\) at turn 25 (safe as freeway 5 at turn 25 is clear).\n- At turn 25, move up (U) to position \\((0, 6)\\) at turn 26 (safe as freeway 6 at turn 26 is clear).\n- At turn 26, move up (U) to position \\((0, 7)\\) at turn 27.\n- At turns 27, 28, and 29, stay (S) to avoid freeway 8 during dangerous turns (28, 29, 30), remaining at \\((0, 7)\\) at turns 28, 29, and 30.\n- At turn 30, move up (U) to position \\((0, 8)\\) at turn 31 (safe as freeway 8 at turn 31 is clear).\n- At turn 31, move up (U) to position \\((0, 9)\\) at turn 32.\n- At turn 32, stay (S) to remain at \\((0, 9)\\) at turn 33, satisfying the condition of being at \\((0, 9)\\) at turn \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 19 + 14 - 1 = 32\\).\n\nThis sequence ensures no collisions with cars on freeways 1 to 8, as verified for each turn.\n\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{array}{c}\n\\text{Turn } 19\\!: & \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 20\\!: & \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 21\\!: & \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 22\\!: & \\text{D} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 23\\!: & \\text{S} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 24\\!: & \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 25\\!: & \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 26\\!: & \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 27\\!: & \\text{S} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 28\\!: & \\text{S} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 29\\!: & \\text{S} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 30\\!: & \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 31\\!: & \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 32\\!: & \\text{S} \\\\\n\\end{array}\n}",

To make it easier, I'll set t_1 = 0 for now, so turn t_1 is t=0, and I need to reach y=9 at some turn H, starting from y=4.\n\nIn the problem, t_1 is given as 21, but for calculation, I can use relative time. But when checking collisions, I need absolute turn numbers because car positions depend on T - t_1.\n\nLet me set τ = T - t_1, so at τ=0, it's turn t_1=21.\n\nPlayer starts at y=4.\n\nI need to go to y=9, so I need to move up 5 times, but I might have to wait or move down to avoid cars, so H could be more than 5.\n\nEach action U, D, S changes y by +1, -1, 0, and y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nNow, let's list all the cars on each freeway.\n\nFreeway 1: one car, head=24, tail=1, direction=right, speed=24. Since it's right-moving, span at τ=0: [τ, h] = [1,24]? No.\n\nThe car update: for right-moving, span at T is [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]? Let's see the notation.\n\nIt says: for right-moving, Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nIn the table, for freeway 1, it says (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s) = (24, 1, right, 24)\n\nSo tail τ=1, head h=24.\n\nSince direction is right, at turn t_1, span is [tail, head] = [1,24] for x-coordinates? I think x from left to right.\n\nAnd it moves right, so at time T, position increases.\n\nSpan(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)] = [1 + 24(τ), 24 + 24(τ)] where τ = T - t_1.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but here all seem right-moving except possibly, but in this case all are right-moving I think.\n\nLet's list all.\n\nFreeway 1: tail=1, head=24, right, speed=24. So Span(T) = [1 + 24(τ), 24 + 24(τ)] with τ = T - 21.\n\nCollision if player on y=1 at turn T and 0 in Span(T), i.e., 0 between 1+24τ and 24+24τ inclusive.\n\nSince it's a span, I assume inclusive, like [low, high].\n\nNow, 0 in [1+24τ, 24+24τ] only if 1+24τ <= 0 <= 24+24τ.\n\nBut 1+24τ <=0 implies τ <= -1/24, which is impossible since τ >=0, so 1+24τ >=1 >0, so 0 < 1+24τ <= x <=24+24τ, so 0 is never in the span for this car. Because min x is 1+24τ >=1 >0.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 2: tail=-12? Head=-47? That can't be right.\n\nLook: for freeway 2: (-12, -47, right, 36)\n\nTail τ=-12, head h=-47? But if right-moving, head should be greater than tail, but -47 < -12, so tail is larger? I think there's confusion in notation.\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\nThe car state is given as (head, tail, direction, speed)\n\nFor freeway 1: (24, 1, right, 24) so head=24, tail=1, since right, tail < head.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: (-12, -47, right, 36) head=-12, tail=-47? But -12 > -47, so if right, head should be on the right, so head > tail, so tail=-47, head=-12? But it says (head, tail) = (-12, -47), but -12 > -47, so tail is -47, head is -12? But typically tail is left, head is right for right-moving.\n\nIn the span definition, for right-moving, Span(t_1) = [τ, h] with τ tail, h head, so [left, right].\n\nIn freeway 2, it says (head, tail) = (-12, -47), but -12 > -47, so if we take τ = tail = -47, h = head = -12.\n\nSimilarly, direction right.\n\nSo at τ=0, span = [τ, h] = [-47, -12]\n\nThen Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)] = [-47 + 36τ, -12 + 36τ]\n\nCollision if on y=2 at turn T and 0 in [-47+36τ, -12+36τ]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as freeway 2? (-12, -47, right, 36) identical to freeway 2.\n\nFreeway 4: also (-12, -47, right, 36) same.\n\nFreeway 5: three cars: (-12, -23, right, 6), (-48, -59, right, 6), (30, 19, right, 6)\n\nLet's parse: first car: head=-12, tail=-23? -12 > -23, so tail=-23, head=-12? But head should be larger for right-moving.\n\nSimilarly, second car: head=-48, tail=-59, -48 > -59, tail=-59, head=-48.\n\nThird car: head=30, tail=19, 30>19, tail=19, head=30.\n\nAll right-moving, speed 6.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 6: same as freeway 5.\n\nFreeway 7: (36, 25, right, 12) head=36, tail=25? 36>25, tail=25, head=36.\n\nFreeway 8: (-28, -39, right, 4) head=-28, tail=-39, -28 > -39, tail=-39, head=-28.\n\nAll cars are right-moving.\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need to find when a car covers x=0 at turn T.\n\nPlayer is at x=0 always, I think, since moving vertically.\n\nNow, collision if at turn T, player is on freeway k, and for some car on k, 0 in Span(T) for that car.\n\nSpan(T) is the interval occupied by the car at turn T.\n\nAlso, note that if player moves to a different y at turn T, they are not on that freeway until the next turn? Let's see the note.\n\n\"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 in Span(T) but not Span(T+1).\"\n\nBut for the freeway you are on at turn T, if 0 in Span(T) for that freeway, collision.\n\nAt turn T, player is at position (0, y_T), and we check if on freeway y_T (which is between 1 and 8), if there is a car with 0 in its span at that turn.\n\nIf player moves to y_{T+1} at turn T, but at turn T, position is still (0,y_T), and y_{T+1} is the position after action.\n\nLet's clarify the timing.\n\nAt the start of turn t, player is at (0, y_t).\n\nThen player chooses action a_t: U, D, or S.\n\nThen y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with Δy_t as defined.\n\nThen, after moving, we have position for turn t+1.\n\nBut collision is checked at turn T, meaning when player is at (0,y_T), we check for that freeway y_T.\n\nThe note says: if at turn T, you choose to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T, then at turn T, you are on y_T, not on y_{T+1}, so for collision at turn T, we only care about cars on y_T.\n\nAnd for cars on y_{T+1}, since you are not on it at turn T, you don't care about Span(T) for y_{T+1}, even if you will be there at T+1.\n\nAt T+1, you will check for y_{T+1} cars.\n\nThe key point is that collision is per turn based on current position.\n\nNow, for each freeway k, I need to find for which turns T, if player is on k, collision occurs, i.e., for some car on k, 0 is in Span(T).\n\nSince multiple cars per freeway possible.\n\nFirst, let's list for each freeway the cars and when 0 is covered.\n\nSet τ = T - 21, so τ >=0.\n\nFreeway 1: only one car, Span(T) = [1 + 24τ, 24 + 24τ]\n\n0 in this only if 1+24τ <=0 <=24+24τ, but 1+24τ >=1 >0 for τ>=0, so never true. So freeway 1 is always safe; no car covers x=0 at any time.\n\nFreeway 2: cars: one car with Span(T) = [-47 + 36τ, -12 + 36τ]\n\n0 in this if -47 + 36τ <= 0 <= -12 + 36τ\n\nSo left: -47 + 36τ <= 0 => 36τ <= 47 => τ <= 47/36 ≈ 1.305\n\nRight: 0 <= -12 + 36τ => 36τ >=12 => τ >= 12/36 = 1/3 ≈ 0.333\n\nSo for τ between 1/3 and 47/36, approximately τ from 0.333 to 1.305.\n\nSince τ integer? Turns are discrete, so τ integer >=0.\n\nτ = T - 21, T turn number, integer.\n\nSo τ integer.\n\nτ >= ceil(1/3) = 1? 1/3≈0.333, so τ >=1? τ min when 36τ >=12, τ >= 12/36=1/3, so since τ integer, τ >=1.\n\nτ max when 36τ <=47, τ <=47/36≈1.305, so τ <=1.\n\nτ >=1 and τ <=1, so only τ=1.\n\nFor τ=1: -47 +36*1 = -47+36= -11 <=0, and -12+36=24 >=0, yes 0 in [-11,24].\n\nFor τ=0: -47 +0 = -47 <=0, but -12 +0= -12 <=0? 0 <= -12 +36τ for τ=0, -12 <=0 is true, but 0 <= -12? 0 <= -12 is false.\n\n0 in [a,b] means a <= 0 <= b.\n\nFor τ=0: a= -47, b= -12, -47 <=0 true, but 0 <= -12? 0 <= -12 is false, so 0 not <= b, since b=-12<0.\n\nSimilarly, τ=1: a= -47+36= -11, b= -12+36=24, -11 <=0 <=24 true.\n\nτ=2: a= -47+72=25, b= -12+72=60, 25<=0<=60? 25>0, false.\n\nSo only at τ=1, which is T=21+1=22, freeway 2 has a car covering x=0.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as freeway 2, (-12,-47,right,36), so same, only at T=22 collision on y=3.\n\nFreeway 3 has the same car? But it's a different freeway.\n\nFreeway 3: also (-12,-47,right,36), so identical, so on y=3, collision at T=22 only.\n\nSimilarly freeway 4: same, collision at T=22 only.\n\nNow freeway 5: three cars.\n\nFirst car: head=-12, tail=-23, right, speed=6. So tail τ=-23, head h=-12.\n\nSpan(T) = [-23 +6τ, -12 +6τ]\n\n0 in this if -23+6τ <=0 <= -12+6τ\n\nLeft: -23+6τ <=0 => 6τ <=23 => τ <= 23/6 ≈3.833\n\nRight: 0 <= -12+6τ => 6τ >=12 => τ >=2\n\nSo τ from 2 to 3, inclusive? τ integer.\n\nτ >=2 and τ <=3 (since 23/6=3.833, τ<=3)\n\nτ=2: a= -23+12= -11, b= -12+12=0, -11 <=0 <=0 true, since 0<=0.\n\nb= -12+6τ, for τ=2, -12+12=0, so [ -11, 0], 0 included.\n\nτ=3: a= -23+18= -5, b= -12+18=6, -5<=0<=6 true.\n\nτ=4: a= -23+24=1, b= -12+24=12, 1<=0<=12? 1>0 false.\n\nSo for first car, collision at τ=2 and τ=3, T=23 and 24.\n\nSecond car on freeway 5: head=-48, tail=-59, right, speed=6.\n\nTail τ=-59, head h=-48? Head=-48, tail=-59.\n\nSpan(T) = [-59 +6τ, -48 +6τ]\n\n0 in this if -59+6τ <=0 <= -48+6τ\n\nLeft: -59+6τ <=0 => 6τ <=59 => τ <=59/6≈9.833\n\nRight: 0 <= -48+6τ => 6τ >=48 => τ >=8\n\nSo τ from 8 to 9, inclusive.\n\nτ=8: a= -59+48= -11, b= -48+48=0, -11<=0<=0 true.\n\nτ=9: a= -59+54= -5, b= -48+54=6, -5<=0<=6 true.\n\nτ=10: a= -59+60=1, b= -48+60=12, 1<=0<=12 false.\n\nSo collision at τ=8,9 T=29,30.\n\nThird car on freeway 5: head=30, tail=19, right, speed=6.\n\nTail=19, head=30.\n\nSpan(T) = [19 +6τ, 30 +6τ]\n\n0 in this? 19+6τ >=19>0 for τ>=0, so never <=0, so 0 not in span. Always safe for this car.\n\nSo on freeway 5, collisions when:\n\n- First car: τ=2,3 (T=23,24)\n\n- Second car: τ=8,9 (T=29,30)\n\n- Third car: never\n\nSo overall, on y=5, collision at T=23,24,29,30.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6: same cars as freeway 5? It says same: (-12,-23,right,6), (-48,-59,right,6), (30,19,right,6)\n\nSo identical to freeway 5, so on y=6, collision at same times: T=23,24,29,30.\n\nNow freeway 7: one car, (36,25,right,12) head=36, tail=25.\n\nSpan(T) = [25 +12τ, 36 +12τ]\n\nAll positive, min 25>0, so 0 never in span. Safe always.\n\nFreeway 8: one car, (-28,-39,right,4) head=-28, tail=-39.\n\nSpan(T) = [-39 +4τ, -28 +4τ]\n\n0 in this if -39+4τ <=0 <= -28+4τ\n\nLeft: -39+4τ <=0 => 4τ <=39 => τ <=39/4=9.75\n\nRight: 0 <= -28+4τ => 4τ >=28 => τ >=7\n\nSo τ from 7 to 9 inclusive.\n\nτ=7: a= -39+28= -11, b= -28+28=0, -11<=0<=0 true.\n\nτ=8: a= -39+32= -7, b= -28+32=4, -7<=0<=4 true.\n\nτ=9: a= -39+36= -3, b= -28+36=8, -3<=0<=8 true.\n\nτ=10: a= -39+40=1, b= -28+40=12, 1<=0<=12 false.\n\nSo on y=8, collision at τ=7,8,9 → T=28,29,30.\n\nNow, summarize dangerous times for each freeway:\n\n- y=1: always safe\n\n- y=2: collision at T=22 (τ=1)\n\n- y=3: collision at T=22 (τ=1)\n\n- y=4: no cars? Freeway y=4, but in the table, freeways 1 to 8 are given, but y=4 is freeway 4? Freeway k for y=k?\n\nThe freeways are y=1 to y=8, and we have cars on each, but for y=4, freeway 4 has cars? Freeway 4 has (-12,-47,right,36), which we analyzed.\n\nFreeway 4: collision at T=22 only.\n\nBut y=4 is the row, freeway 4 corresponds to y=4.\n\nIn the grid, freeway y=1 to 8, each has cars.\n\nBut for y=4, freeway 4: we have collision only at T=22.\n\nSimilarly, all covered.\n\nNow, player starts at y=4 at turn t=21 (τ=0).\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\ny=9 is the goal, no freeway, so no cars, safe.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, I assume, since no cars mentioned.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are not freeways, so no cars, always safe.\n\nBut player can be at y=0 or y=9.\n\nNow, the path: we start at y=4 at τ=0 (T=21).\n\nWe need to find a sequence of actions to go to y=9 in min turns.\n\nEach U increases y by 1, D decreases, S stay.\n\ny must be in 0 to 9.\n\nNow, the dangerous freeways at certain times.\n\nSince we start at y=4, and need to go to y=9, we probably want to go up, but may need to wait or go down to avoid.\n\nFirst, let's list the collision times:\n\nFor each y and T, if it's dangerous to be on that y at that T.\n\ny=1: always safe\n\ny=2: dangerous at T=22\n\ny=3: dangerous at T=22\n\ny=4: dangerous only at T=22? Freeway 4 has collision at T=22.\n\nAt τ=1, T=22.\n\nBut at other times? Freeway 4 only at T=22.\n\nSimilarly, y=5: dangerous at T=23,24,29,30\n\ny=6: dangerous at T=23,24,29,30\n\ny=7: always safe\n\ny=8: dangerous at T=28,29,30\n\ny=0 and y=9 always safe.\n\nNow, start at T=21, y=4.\n\nAt T=21, we are at y=4. Is it safe? At T=21, τ=0.\n\nFor y=4, freeway 4: at τ=0, Span(T) = [-47, -12] for the car, 0 not in, as we saw earlier, safe.\n\nSimilarly, all other freeways at τ=0 are safe except possibly, but y=2,3 at τ=0: for y=2, at τ=0, Span=[-47,-12], 0 not in, safe. Similarly y=3,4 same.\n\ny=5,6 at τ=0 safe, etc.\n\nSo at T=21, y=4 is safe.\n\nNow, we need to reach y=9.\n\nThe minimal steps if no cars would be 5 ups: U,U,U,U,U, from y=4 to 5,6,7,8,9 in 5 turns.\n\nBut we need to check for collisions during the path.\n\nSuppose we go straight up.\n\nStart T=21, y=4, safe.\n\nAfter action at T=21, we go to next position.\n\nLet’s define the state after action.\n\nAt turn T, we are at position y_T.\n\nWe choose action a_T, which determines y_{T+1}.\n\nThen at turn T+1, we are at y_{T+1}, and check collision for that position and turn.\n\nFor example, at T=21, y=4.\n\nWe choose a_{21}, which affects y_{22}.\n\nIf we choose U, then y_{22} = 5.\n\nIf D, y_{22}=3, etc.\n\nThen at turn T=22, we are at y_{22}, and we check if on that freeway, collision at T=22.\n\nSimilarly for other turns.\n\nIn the straight up plan:\n\nT=21: y=4, choose U, so y_{22} =5\n\nNow at T=22, y=5, but y=5 is freeway, and T=22, is it dangerous? y=5 dangerous at T=23,24,29,30, not at 22.\n\nAt T=22, for y=5: τ=1, T=22, τ=1.\n\nFor freeway 5, at τ=1: first car span [-23+6*1, -12+6*1] = [-17,-6], all negative, 0 not in. Second car [-59+6, -48+6]=[-53,-42], no. Third [19+6,30+6]=[25,36], no. So safe at T=22 for y=5.\n\nSimilarly, y=6 safe at T=22.\n\nBut y=2 and y=3 dangerous at T=22, but we are not there.\n\nSo at T=22, y=5, safe.\n\nThen choose U again, a_{22}=U, y_{23}=6\n\nAt T=23, y=6, now T=23, y=6 dangerous? y=6 dangerous at T=23,24,29,30.\n\nAt T=23, τ=2, for freeway 6: first car [-23+12, -12+12]=[-11,0], 0 in, yes collision! At τ=2, first car on y=6 has span [-11,0], so 0 in, collision.\n\nSimilarly, if we are on y=5 at T=23, same, first car has [-11,0] at τ=2.\n\nBut in this case, at T=23, y=6, collision.\n\nSo straight up: after two ups, at T=23 y=6, collision.\n\nNot good.\n\nWe could go slower or detour.\n\nSince y=7 is always safe, we can go to y=7 quickly and stay or go up.\n\ny=7 safe.\n\nBut from y=4 to y=7, need 3 ups.\n\nBut at T=22, if we are on y=5 or something.\n\nLet's think about timing.\n\nDangerous times:\n\n- T=22: y=2,3,4 dangerous? y=4 at T=22 dangerous.\n\ny=4: freeway 4 at T=22, τ=1, Span=[-47+36, -12+36]=[-11,24], 0 in, yes dangerous.\n\ny=2 and y=3 also dangerous at T=22.\n\nBut y=5 and y=6 safe at T=22.\n\ny=7 safe.\n\nThen T=23: y=5 and y=6 dangerous (due to first car)\n\nT=24: y=5 and y=6 dangerous (first car)\n\nT=25,26,27: all safe? y=5 and y=6 at other times: at T=25, τ=4, for y=5: first car span [-23+24, -12+24]=[1,12], 0 not in; second car not yet, so safe. Similarly y=6 safe at T=25,26,27.\n\nThen T=28: y=8 dangerous (since y=8 at T=28,29,30)\n\ny=8 dangerous T=28,29,30.\n\nT=29,30 also y=5 and y=6 dangerous from second car.\n\nNow, back to start.\n\nAt T=21, y=4, safe.\n\nWe need to avoid being on y=4 at T=22, because dangerous.\n\nSimilarly, avoid y=2,3 at T=22.\n\nBut we are at y=4 now, so at T=21, we must choose an action.\n\nIf we choose S, stay, then at T=22, y=4, which is dangerous, collision.\n\nIf we choose U, to y=5, then at T=22, y=5, which is safe, as above.\n\nIf we choose D, to y=3, then at T=22, y=3, dangerous, collision.\n\nSo only choice is to go up to y=5 at T=22.\n\na_{21} must be U, so y_{22}=5.\n\nNow at T=22, y=5, safe.\n\nNow we choose a_{22}.\n\nIf we go up to y=6, then at T=23, y=6, which is dangerous (collision at T=23).\n\nIf we stay, y=5 at T=23, also dangerous.\n\nIf we go down to y=4, but at T=23, y=4: is it dangerous? y=4 at T=23, τ=2.\n\nFor freeway 4, car: Span(T) = [-47 +36*2, -12 +36*2] = [-47+72, -12+72] = [25,60], 25>0, 0 not in, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=4 only dangerous at T=22, not at other times.\n\nSimilarly, y=3, at T=23: freeway 3, car Span(T) = [-47+36*2, -12+36*2]=[25,60], safe.\n\ny=2 same.\n\nBut y=5 and y=6 dangerous at T=23.\n\nSo at T=22, we are at y=5, safe.\n\nWe can choose to go down to y=4, or stay, or up.\n\nIf up to y=6, then T=23 y=6 collision.\n\nIf stay, y=5 at T=23 collision.\n\nIf down to y=4, then at T=23, y=4, safe, as above.\n\nThen from there, we can go up later.\n\nBut we need to go to y=9 eventually.\n\nAfter going down to y=4 at T=23, we can then go up.\n\nBut let's see the time.\n\nWe are at T=23, y=4.\n\nNow T=23, we choose a_{23}.\n\nWe can go up to y=5, but at T=23, y=5 is dangerous? Yes, T=23 y=5 collision, so cannot go to y=5 at T=23.\n\nIf we go up to y=5, then at T=24? Action at T=23 determines y_{24}.\n\nAt turn T=23, we are at y_{23}=4 (after action from previous).\n\nWe choose a_{23}, which sets y_{24}.\n\nIf we choose U, then y_{24}=5.\n\nThen at turn T=24, we are at y=5, which is dangerous because T=24 y=5 collision.\n\nSimilarly, if we choose S, y_{24}=4, then at T=24, y=4, safe? T=24 τ=3.\n\ny=4: freeway 4, Span=[-47+36*3, -12+36*3]=[-47+108, -12+108]=[61,96], 0 not in, safe.\n\nBut we are at y=4, not moving towards goal.\n\nIf we choose D, to y=3, then at T=24, y=3, safe? Similar, no issue.\n\nBut we need to go up eventually.\n\nAt T=23, y=4, safe.\n\nTo avoid y=5 at T=24, we can stay or go down, but better to stay.\n\na_{23} = S, so y_{24}=4.\n\nThen at T=24, y=4, safe.\n\nNow choose a_{24}, for T=24.\n\nWe can go up to y=5? But at T=25? Action at T=24 sets y_{25}.\n\nIf a_{24}=U, y_{25}=5.\n\nThen at turn T=25, y=5.\n\nT=25, τ=4.\n\ny=5: freeway 5, at τ=4: first car span [-23+24, -12+24]=[1,12], 0 not in; second car not until τ=8, so safe. Similarly y=6 safe.\n\ny=5 at T=25 safe.\n\nSimilarly, we can go up.\n\nIn this case, we delayed.\n\nBut let's see the sequence so far.\n\nStart T=21, y=4\n\na_{21} = U → y_{22} =5\n\nAt T=22, y=5, safe\n\na_{22} = D → y_{23} =4  (down to avoid)\n\nAt T=23, y=4, safe\n\na_{23} = S → y_{24} =4  (stay)\n\nAt T=24, y=4, safe\n\na_{24} = U → y_{25} =5\n\nAt T=25, y=5, safe (since T=25 not dangerous for y=5)\n\nThen we can continue up.\n\nBut we need to go to y=9.\n\nFrom y=5 at T=25, we can go up to y=6,7,8,9.\n\nBut y=6 is safe at T=25,26,27.\n\nThen y=8 has danger at T=28,29,30.\n\nSo let's go up.\n\na_{24}=U, y_{25}=5\n\nThen a_{25}=U, y_{26}=6\n\nAt T=26, y=6, safe? T=26, τ=5, y=6: first car span [-23+30, -12+30]=[7,18], no 0; second car not, safe.\n\na_{26}=U, y_{27}=7\n\nAt T=27, y=7, always safe.\n\na_{27}=U, y_{28}=8\n\nNow at T=28, y=8, but y=8 dangerous at T=28,29,30.\n\nAt T=28, collision if on y=8.\n\nSo we cannot be on y=8 at T=28.\n\nProblem.\n\nAfter y_{27}=7 at T=27, we could stay or go up or down.\n\nBut if go up to y=8, then T=28 y=8 collision.\n\nIf stay, y=7 at T=28, safe.\n\nThen we need to go to y=8 or 9 later.\n\nBut y=8 dangerous until T=30.\n\nAt T=30, y=8 dangerous? T=30 τ=9, y=8: Span=[-39+36, -28+36]=[-3,8], 0 in, yes dangerous.\n\nT=31: τ=10, Span=[-39+40, -28+40]=[1,12], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSo y=8 safe after T=30, i.e., T=31 and later.\n\nSimilarly, y=5 and y=6 dangerous at T=29,30, but we are not there.\n\nBack to T=27, y=7.\n\nIf we go up to y=8 at T=28, collision.\n\nSo we should not go up now.\n\nWe can stay at y=7 for a while.\n\na_{27} = S, then y_{28}=7\n\nAt T=28, y=7, safe (y=7 always safe)\n\nThen now T=28, we can choose to go to y=8 or not.\n\nBut if go to y=8, then T=29 y=8, which is dangerous (T=29 τ=8, y=8 Span=[-39+32, -28+32]=[-7,4], 0 in)\n\nSimilarly, T=30 dangerous.\n\nSo we need to wait until T=31 to go to y=8.\n\nAt T=28, y=7, we can stay.\n\na_{28} = S, y_{29}=7\n\nAt T=29, y=7, safe.\n\na_{29} = S, y_{30}=7\n\nAt T=30, y=7, safe.\n\nNow a_{30} = U, y_{31}=8\n\nAt T=31, y=8, now T=31 τ=10, y=8: Span=[-39+40, -28+40]=[1,12], 0 not in, safe.\n\nThen a_{31} = U, y_{32}=9\n\nAt T=32, y=9, goal reached.\n\nNow, H is the number of turns from start to end.\n\nStarted at T=21, ended at T=32, so H = 32 - 21 + 1? Let's see the turns.\n\nWe have actions from t=21 to t=31, and position at t=32 is y=9.\n\nThe sequence: we have actions for turns t_1 to t_1 + H -1, and after H actions, we reach at turn t_1 + H.\n\nStart at turn t_1 =21, position (0,y_{t_1}) = (0,4)\n\nAfter H turns, we are at turn t_1 + H, position (0,9)\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nIn this case, from T=21 to T=31, actions, then at T=32, y=9.\n\nH actions, from t=21 to t=21+H-1, position at t=21+H is (0,9)\n\nHere, from T=21 to T=31, that's 11 actions? T=21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31: that's 11 turns for actions.\n\nThen at T=32, y=9.\n\nSo H=11.\n\nBut we can do better? Earlier we wasted some time going down and staying.\n\nFor example, from start, at T=21, we went up to y=5 at T=22.\n\nThen instead of going down, we could have stayed at y=5 but at T=23 it is dangerous, so we had to leave.\n\nBut at T=22, y=5, we could go up to y=6, but at T=23 y=6 collision.\n\nUnless we time it differently.\n\nAnother idea: go down first to avoid, but y=3 and y=2 are dangerous at T=22, so not good.\n\nStart at T=21 y=4.\n\nInstead of going up, go down? But to y=3, then at T=22 y=3 dangerous.\n\nGo to y=0? But that might take more time.\n\nFor example, a_{21}=D, to y=3, but at T=22 y=3 collision.\n\na_{21}=S, to y=4 at T=22 collision.\n\nSo only choice is a_{21}=U to y=5 at T=22.\n\nSo we must go to y=5 at T=22.\n\nNow at T=22 y=5, we need to not be on y=5 or y=6 at T=23 and T=24.\n\nSince both dangerous.\n\nSo we must be below or above.\n\nBelow: y=4 or less, but y=4 at T=23 is safe, as we saw.\n\nAbove: y=7 or higher, but we are at y=5, so to go to y=7, we need two ups, but at T=23, if we go up once, to y=6, which is dangerous at T=23.\n\nIf we go directly to y=7 from y=5, but we can only move one per turn, so y_{23} would be 6 if we go up from y=5.\n\nThen at T=23 y=6 collision.\n\nSo cannot reach y=7 by T=23.\n\nThus, the only safe option at T=22 is to go down to y=4 or lower.\n\ny=4 is safe at T=23.\n\nWe could go to y=3, but y=3 is safe at T=23, since only dangerous at T=22.\n\nSimilarly y=2 safe at T=23.\n\nBut going down might not help, since we need to go up later.\n\nBut in our earlier path, we went down to y=4 at T=23.\n\nThen we stayed at T=23 and T=24 at y=4.\n\nBut at T=24, we are at y=4, but we could have gone up at T=24 to y=5 at T=25.\n\nIn the sequence, at T=23, after going down, we are at y=4.\n\nAt T=23, we chose to stay, so y_{24}=4.\n\nBut at T=23, we could choose to go up to y=5, but then y_{24}=5, and at T=24, y=5 is dangerous (T=24 collision for y=5), so we cannot.\n\nAt T=23, if we choose U, y_{24}=5, then at T=24, y=5 collision.\n\nSo we must choose S or D at T=23 to avoid y=5 at T=24.\n\nSimilarly, if we choose D to y=3, then y_{24}=3, at T=24 y=3 safe, but then we need to come back up.\n\nBut y=3 at T=24 is fine, but it takes extra steps.\n\nBetter to stay at y=4.\n\nThen at T=24, we go up to y=5 at T=25, safe.\n\nNow, from there, we can go up to y=6,7,8,9.\n\nBut y=8 has danger at T=28,29,30.\n\nWe need to time so that we are not on y=8 during those times.\n\nFrom T=25, y=5.\n\na_{25}=U, y_{26}=6\n\na_{26}=U, y_{27}=7\n\na_{27}=U, y_{28}=8\n\nBut at T=28, y=8 dangerous.\n\nProblem.\n\nSo we need to delay or something.\n\nAt T=27, y=7, if we go up, y_{28}=8 collision.\n\nSo we need to stay at y=7 until T=30, then go to y=8 at T=31, as before.\n\nBut that takes many turns.\n\nCan we go faster to y=9?\n\nAnother idea: after reaching y=7, instead of going directly to y=8, we can go to y=9 directly from y=7? But we can only move one step, so to y=8 first.\n\nUnless we go to y=8 when safe.\n\nBut the danger is T=28,29,30, so T=31 safe.\n\nBut we can be on y=9, which is safe, but to reach y=9, we need to be on y=8 first or directly? From y=7 to y=8 to y=9.\n\nWe could consider going to y=6 or other, but y=6 has danger later at T=29,30.\n\nIn this case, from T=25 y=5, if we go to y=6 at T=26, then at T=26 y=6 safe.\n\nThen a_{26}=U to y=7 at T=27.\n\nThen at T=27 y=7, we can stay or go up.\n\nIf go up, y_{28}=8, collision at T=28.\n\nSo must stay at y=7 for T=28,29,30.\n\nThen go to y=8 at T=31, etc.\n\nBut we can reach y=7 earlier.\n\nLet's list the actions and positions.\n\nStart: T=21, y=4\n\na21: U → y22=5\n\nT=22, y=5\n\nNow, instead of going down, can we stay? But at T=23, if we stay, y23=5 collision.\n\nGo up? y23=6 collision.\n\nSo must move down.\n\na22: D → y23=4\n\nT=23, y=4\n\nNow at T=23, we choose a23.\n\nIf a23=S, y24=4\n\nT=24, y=4\n\na24: U → y25=5\n\nT=25, y=5\n\na25: U → y26=6\n\nT=26, y=6\n\na26: U → y27=7\n\nT=27, y=7\n\nNow, from here, we need to go to y=8, but not during T=28,29,30.\n\nSo we can stay at y=7 for a few turns.\n\na27: S → y28=7\n\nT=28, y=7\n\na28: S → y29=7\n\nT=29, y=7\n\na29: S → y30=7\n\nT=30, y=7\n\na30: U → y31=8\n\nT=31, y=8 (safe, τ=10)\n\na31: U → y32=9\n\nT=32, y=9\n\nSo actions from t=21 to t=31, that's 11 actions.\n\nH=11.\n\nBut can we reduce?\n\nFor example, at T=22, y=5, instead of going down to y=4, can we go down to y=3 or something? But y=3 is safe at T=23, but then we need to come back, might take same or more steps.\n\nFor example, a22: D to y=3? y23=3\n\nThen T=23, y=3\n\nThen we can go up, but at T=24, if we go to y=4, safe.\n\nBut then similar.\n\na23: U to y24=4\n\nT=24, y=4\n\nThen same as before, a24: U to y25=5, etc.\n\nStill, we reach y=7 at T=27 same.\n\nNo gain.\n\nAfter y=7 at T=27, can we go to y=8 at T=27? No, because action at T=27 sets y28.\n\nAt T=27, if we choose U, y28=8, but T=28 collision.\n\nSo must wait.\n\nBut y=8 is only dangerous from T=28 to 30, so we can be on y=8 at T=27 or T=31.\n\nBut at T=27, we are at y=7, not y=8.\n\nTo be on y=8 at T=27, we need to be there at turn 27.\n\nBut we are at y=7 at T=27, so we cannot be at y=8 at T=27.\n\nThe earliest we can be at y=8 is T=28 if we go up from y=7 at T=27.\n\nBut T=28 dangerous.\n\nSo we cannot be at y=8 before T=31 safely.\n\nT=31 is safe.\n\nNow, another point: we have y=5 and y=6 dangerous at T=29,30, but in this path, we are not on them at that time.\n\nBut perhaps we can reach y=7 faster or later.\n\nIn the beginning, we had to go to y=5 at T=22 and then down to avoid T=23.\n\nBut is there a way to be at y=6 or y=7 at T=23 without collision?\n\nAt T=23, y=5 and y=6 are dangerous, y=7 is safe.\n\nBut to be at y=7 at T=23, we need to be at y=6 at T=22 and go up, or something.\n\nStart T=21 y=4.\n\nIf we go up to y=5 at T=22.\n\nThen at T=22, if we could go directly to y=7, but cannot, only to y=6.\n\nThen at T=23 y=6 collision.\n\nNo way.\n\nGo down first? But at T=21, if we go down, to y=3, then at T=22 y=3 collision.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo no, we must go through that down move.\n\nBut perhaps we can stay at y=4 longer, but at T=22, y=4 collision, so we must leave y=4 before T=22.\n\nAt T=21, we must move to y=5 to avoid.\n\nThen at T=22, we must move down to avoid T=23.\n\nSo the detour is necessary.\n\nThen we have to wait at y=4 for two turns? In our sequence, from T=23 to T=24 at y=4.\n\nBut at T=23, y=4, we could go up to y=5 at T=24, but T=24 y=5 is dangerous, so we cannot.\n\nUnless we go at a different time.\n\nT=24 is dangerous for y=5, but T=25 is safe.\n\nSo we need to be at y=5 at T=25, not T=24.\n\nSimilarly, we can be at y=6 at T=25 or 26, etc.\n\nBut in our case, we are at y=4 at T=23 and T=24.\n\nAt T=24, we go to y=5 at T=25.\n\nNow, to save a turn, at T=23, instead of staying, can we go down to y=3 and come back? But that would take more actions.\n\nFor example, a23: D to y=3, y24=3\n\nT=24, y=3\n\nThen a24: U to y25=4\n\nT=25, y=4\n\nThen a25: U to y26=5\n\nT=26, y=5, which is later than before, worse.\n\nSo staying at y=4 is better.\n\nThus, the sequence we have seems efficient in terms of waiting.\n\nNow, for the upper part, we are at y=7 from T=27 to T=30, waiting to avoid y=8 danger.\n\nBut can we go to y=8 earlier or later?\n\nThe danger is T=28,29,30.\n\nWe can be at y=8 at T=27? But to be at y=8 at T=27, we need to be at y=7 at T=26 and go up.\n\nBut let's see if we can reach earlier.\n\nCurrently, we reach y=7 at T=27.\n\nIf we can reach y=7 earlier, then we might wait less.\n\nBut from start, we reached y=5 at T=22, then down to y=4 at T=23, stay T=24, to y=5 at T=25, to y=6 at T=26, to y=7 at T=27.\n\nCan we get to y=7 faster?\n\nFor example, from T=22 y=5, if we go down to y=4 at T=23, then at T=23, instead of staying, if we could go up, but to y=5 at T=24 dangerous.\n\nNo.\n\nAnother idea: go to y=0 or y=9 directly, but not possible in one step.\n\nOr use y=1, but y=1 is always safe, but we are at y=4.\n\nFor example, from T=21 y=4, go down multiple times, but that takes time and might hit danger.\n\nFor instance, a21: D to y=3, but then at T=22 y=3 collision.\n\na21: S, but T=22 y=4 collision.\n\nSo impossible to go down or stay.\n\nThus, only U to y=5.\n\nSo we are stuck with that.\n\nThen at T=22 y=5, we go down to y=4 at T=23.\n\nThen at T=23 y=4, we must stay or go down, but going down wastes time.\n\nSo stay at T=23: S, y24=4.\n\nThen at T=24, U to y25=5.\n\nNow, at T=25 y=5, we go U to y26=6 at T=26.\n\nThen U to y27=7 at T=27.\n\nNow, from here, instead of waiting until T=30, can we go to y=8 when safe?\n\nBut the next safe for y=8 is T=31.\n\nT=27 is too early to be on y=8.\n\nUnless we can be on y=8 at T=27.\n\nBut to be at y=8 at T=27, we need y_{27}=8.\n\nWhich means at T=26, we must be at y=7 and go up.\n\nBut at T=26, we are at y=6, going to y=7 at T=27.\n\nNot at y=7.\n\nTo be at y=7 at T=26, we need earlier action.\n\nFrom T=25 y=5, if we go directly to y=7, but we can only move one step, so at T=26 y=6, T=27 y=7.\n\nCannot be faster.\n\nSo we must be at y=7 at T=27 earliest.\n\nThen we can go to y=8 at T=28 earliest, but dangerous.\n\nSo we have to wait at y=7 until we can go to y=8 safely at T=31.\n\nBut T=31 is late.\n\nNotice that y=9 is safe, and we can be on y=9 directly, but to reach, from y=8.\n\nBut y=8 has a car danger, but if we can pass through y=8 quickly when it is safe for a moment, but the car on y=8 covers multiple turns, and at T=28,29,30 it is covering x=0, so we cannot be on y=8 at those turns.\n\nAt other times, safe.\n\nBut between, for example, T=27, if we can be on y=8, but we can't reach by T=27.\n\nT=31 safe.\n\nBut there might be a gap.\n\nAnother thought: the player can be on y=8 at T=27, but how?\n\nAt T=26, we need y=7, then a26=U, y27=8.\n\nBut at T=26, we are at y=6, so y27=7 if we go up.\n\nTo have y27=8, we need y26=7 and a26=U.\n\nBut at T=25, we are at y=5, so y26=6 if a25=U.\n\nNot y=7.\n\nUnless we start from lower, but we can't.\n\nSo impossible to be at y=8 before T=28.\n\nT=28 dangerous, so we must skip to T=31.\n\nThus, the waiting is necessary.\n\nBut we can consider going to y=9 from y=7? No, must go through y=8.\n\nUnless we go down to y=6 and up, but no.\n\nSo I think H=11 is minimal.\n\nBut let's confirm the actions.\n\nTurn t1=21: a21 = U\n\nTurn 22: a22 = D  (to avoid)\n\nTurn 23: a23 = S  (stay)\n\nTurn 24: a24 = U\n\nTurn 25: a25 = U\n\nTurn 26: a26 = U\n\nTurn 27: a27 = S  (stay to avoid y=8 danger)\n\nTurn 28: a28 = S\n\nTurn 29: a29 = S\n\nTurn 30: a30 = U\n\nTurn 31: a31 = U\n\nThen at turn 32, y=9.\n\nH=11 turns from t=21 to t=31.\n\nBut we can save one turn?\n\nNotice that at T=24, we are at y=4, going to y=5 at T=25.\n\nBut y=5 is safe at T=25,26,27, since danger only at 23,24,29,30.\n\nT=25,26,27 safe.\n\nSimilarly y=6 safe same times.\n\nNow, y=8 danger at T=28,29,30.\n\nIf we can be at y=8 at T=27 or T=31.\n\nBut T=27 not possible.\n\nPerhaps we can reach y=7 earlier, but we can't.\n\nAnother idea: after being at y=4 at T=23, instead of staying at T=24, we can go up at T=24 to y=5, but at T=25 y=5, which is safe, but we are one turn earlier.\n\nIn the sequence: T=23 y=4, a23=U → y24=5\n\nBut at T=24, y=5, which is dangerous! T=24 is a danger time for y=5.\n\nAt τ=3, T=24, y=5: first car span [-23+18, -12+18]=[-5,6], 0 in, yes collision.\n\nSo if we go to y=5 at T=24, collision.\n\nThus, we cannot; we must wait until T=25 to be at y=5.\n\nSimilarly, at T=23, if we go to y=5, collision at T=24? Action at T=23: if a23=U, y24=5, then at T=24 y=5 collision.\n\nSo we must not be at y=5 at T=24.\n\nThus, at T=23, we must choose action such that y24 ≠5, and since we are at y=4, we can choose S, y24=4 or D y24=3 or U y24=5 but U causes collision, so only S or D.\n\nS is better to not go down.\n\nThen y24=4.\n\nThen a24=U, y25=5 safe.\n\nNo choice.\n\nSimilarly for the top.\n\nBut at the top, when we are at y=7, we can stay or go down, but going down wastes time.\n\nPerhaps we can go to y=8 at T=31 directly.\n\nBut we need to arrive at y=8 when safe.\n\nSince y=7 is safe, we can stay.\n\nBut can we leave y=7 earlier for y=9? No.\n\nAnother thought: the player can be on y=9 at turn T, and since no cars, safe, but we need to reach it.\n\nBut to reach, we must pass through y=8.\n\nUnless we jump, but no.\n\nPerhaps we can be on y=8 at a safe time by timing the move.\n\nFor example, at T=27, y=7, if we go up to y=8 at T=28, but T=28 collision.\n\nBut the note says: if we move to y_{T+1} at turn T, we are not on y_{T+1} at turn T, so for collision at turn T, we only care about y_T.\n\nBut when we are on y_{T+1} at turn T+1, we care about cars then.\n\nIn this case, if at T=27, we choose U, then y_{28}=8, and at turn T=28, we are at y=8, and we check collision for y=8 at T=28, which is dangerous.\n\nSo collision.\n\nIf we could move through quickly, but since the move takes a full turn, we are on the freeway for the turn.\n\nSo we must avoid being on dangerous y at dangerous T.\n\nThus, I think H=11 is the minimal.\n\nBut let's see if we can reduce the waiting at y=7.\n\nFor example, if we can be at y=8 at T=27, but impossible.\n\nNotice that at T=30, y=8 is dangerous, but y=9 is safe.\n\nBut to reach y=9, we need to be on y=8 first.\n\nUnless we are at y=8 at T=31 and go to y=9 at T=32.\n\nBut same as before.\n\nPerhaps we can go from y=7 to y=8 at a time when the car just passed, but the car on y=8 covers x=0 from T=28 to 30 inclusive, so no gap until T=31.\n\nT=27 is safe for y=8, but we can't reach.\n\nSo no.\n\nThus, the sequence I have is probably minimal.\n\nNow, to write the answer.\n\nTurn t1=21: U\n\nTurn t1+1=22: D\n\nTurn t1+2=23: S\n\nTurn t1+3=24: U\n\nTurn t1+4=25: U\n\nTurn t1+5=26: U\n\nTurn t1+6=27: S\n\nTurn t1+7=28: S\n\nTurn t1+8=29: S\n\nTurn t1+9=30: U\n\nTurn t1+10=31: U\n\nThen at turn t1+11=32, y=9.\n\nH=11.\n\nt1=21, so turns from 21 to 31.\n\nIn the sequence, actions for t=21 to t=31.\n\nAnswer format:\n\n\\boxed{ Turn 21: U Turn 22: D Turn 23: S Turn 24: U Turn 25: U Turn 26: U Turn 27: S Turn 28: S Turn 29: S Turn 30: U Turn 31: U }\n\nBut let's confirm if all positions are safe.\n\nT=21: y=4, safe\n\nAfter a21=U, y22=5\n\nT=22: y=5, safe as earlier\n\na22=D, y23=4\n\nT=23: y=4, safe (Span [25,60] for y=4 car?

But if U, y23=6 collision; S y23=5 collision; D to y=4 at T=23 safe.\n\nThen at T=23 y=4, if we could go to y=5 at T=24, but T=24 y=5 collision.\n\nCannot.\n\nAt T=23, go U to y=5 at T=24, collision.\n\nNo.\n\nPerhaps after y=7, if we go to y=8 at T=30? But at T=30, y=8 dangerous.\n\na29: from T=29 y=7, if a29=U, y30=8, then at T=30 y=8 collision.\n\nNot possible.\n\na30=U from y=7 to y=8 at T=31, same as before.\n\nSo I think H=11 is minimal.\n\nThus, the sequence is as above.\n</think>\nTo reach the position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 4)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 21\\) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the sequence of actions must account for the dangerous times when cars occupy \\(x = 0\\) on specific freeways. The dangerous times are derived from the car states and their movements:\n\n- Freeway \\(y = 2\\): collision at turn \\(T = 22\\).\n- Freeway \\(y = 3\\): collision at turn \\(T = 22\\).\n- Freeway \\(y = 4\\): collision at turn \\(T = 22\\).\n- Freeway \\(y = 5\\): collisions at turns \\(T = 23, 24, 29, 30\\).\n- Freeway \\(y = 6\\): collisions at turns \\(T = 23, 24, 29, 30\\).\n- Freeway \\(y = 8\\): collisions at turns \\(T = 28, 29, 30\\).\n- Freeways \\(y = 1\\) and \\(y = 7\\) are always safe, and \\(y = 0\\) and \\(y = 9\\) have no cars and are safe.\n\nThe minimal sequence of actions to avoid these collisions and reach \\(y = 9\\) in 11 turns (from turn 21 to turn 31, with the position \\((0, 9)\\) achieved at turn 32) is as follows:\n\n- At turn 21, starting from \\(y = 4\\), action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 5\\) for turn 22, avoiding the collision on \\(y = 4\\) at \\(T = 22\\).\n- At turn 22, action \\(D\\) moves to \\(y = 4\\) for turn 23, avoiding the collisions on \\(y = 5\\) and \\(y = 6\\) at \\(T = 23\\).\n- At turn 23, action \\(S\\) stays at \\(y = 4\\) for turn 24, as moving to \\(y = 5\\) would cause a collision at \\(T = 24\\).\n- At turn 24, action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 5\\) for turn 25, now safe as \\(T = 25\\) has no collision on \\(y = 5\\).\n- At turn 25, action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 6\\) for turn 26, safe as \\(T = 26\\) has no collision on \\(y = 6\\).\n- At turn 26, action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 7\\) for turn 27, safe as \\(y = 7\\) is always safe.\n- At turn 27, action \\(S\\) stays at \\(y = 7\\) for turn 28, avoiding the collision on \\(y = 8\\) at \\(T = 28\\).\n- At turn 28, action \\(S\\) stays at \\(y = 7\\) for turn 29, avoiding \\(y = 8\\) at \\(T = 29\\).\n- At turn 29, action \\(S\\) stays at \\(y = 7\\) for turn 30, avoiding \\(y = 8\\) at \\(T = 30\\).\n- At turn 30, action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 8\\) for turn 31, safe as \\(T = 31\\) has no collision on \\(y = 8\\).\n- At turn 31, action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 9\\) for turn 32, achieving the goal.\n\nThis sequence ensures no collisions and reaches \\(y = 9\\) in the minimal number of turns, \\(H = 11\\).\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 21: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 22: D \\\\ \\text{Turn } 23: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 24: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 25: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 26: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 27: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 28: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 29: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 30: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 31: U }",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to get the player from (0,5) at turn t_1 = 22 to (0,9) in the minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. The player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing the y-position by +1, -1, or 0 respectively, but y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCollision happens at turn T if the player is on a freeway y_T and for that freeway, 0 is within the span of some car at that turn. The car spans move left or right based on their direction and speed.\n\nThe key point is that when you move to a new y-position, you're not on that freeway until the next turn. So if you move from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T you're still on y, and at turn T+1 you're on y+1. So you only check for collision on the freeway you're currently on at that turn.\n\nI need to find a sequence of actions that gets me to y=9 as quickly as possible without colliding.\n\nCurrent turn: t_1 = 22\n\nPlayer position: (0,5)\n\nCars:\n\nFor each freeway, I have the car states at turn t_1=22.\n\nI need to compute for future turns whether 0 is in the span of any car on the freeway the player is on at that turn.\n\nSince the player starts at y=5, and I need to go to y=9, that's 4 steps up. But I might need to wait or go down to avoid cars, but going down might not help since I need to go up eventually, and y=0 is safe I think, but I need to reach y=9.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are not freeways, so no cars there. Only y=1 to 8 have cars. So at y=0 or y=9, no collision possible. But the player starts at (0,5), which is on freeway y=5? Position is (x,y), and x is always 0 for the player, I think. The player is at (0,y), and the cars are on the freeways, which are horizontal lanes at each y-level.\n\nThe collision is based on the x-position. Player is always at x=0, so collision occurs if for the freeway y at turn T, 0 is in the span of a car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nFor freeway k, at turn T, if the player is on y=k, and 0 is in the car span for that freeway at turn T, collision.\n\nNow, for each car, the span is given at t_1, and it moves with speed s.\n\nFor left-moving cars, span moves left, so head and tail decrease by s per turn.\n\nFor right-moving cars, span moves right, so head and tail increase by s per turn.\n\nIn the car state, it says \"head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s\".\n\nAnd for left-moving, it's [h, τ] if h < τ? Let's see the update.\n\nIt says: for left-moving, span(t1) = [h, τ] → at T, [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nBut [h, τ] with h and τ, which is head and tail? It doesn't specify which is left or right, but from the direction, we can infer.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving: [τ, h] → [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nFor right-moving, at t1, it's given as [τ, h], so τ is probably the left end, h is right end? Let's read.\n\nFor right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\"\n\nAnd for left-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\"\n\nIn the car state, it's listed as (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\n\nFor example, freeway 1: (48, 25, right, 24)\n\nDirection right, so for right-moving, span is [τ, h] at t1.\n\nSo for freeway 1: h=48, τ=25, d=right, s=24\n\nSince d=right, span at t1 is [τ, h] = [25, 48]\n\nThen at time T, span is [25 + 24*(T-22), 48 + 24*(T-22)]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFor left-moving, it would be different, but in this case, all cars seem to be right-moving? Let me check the directions.\n\nFreeway 1: right\n\nFreeway 2: right\n\nFreeway 3: right\n\nFreeway 4: right\n\nFreeway 5: three cars, all right\n\nFreeway 6: three cars, all right\n\nFreeway 7: right\n\nFreeway 8: right\n\nAll cars are right-moving! So no left-moving cars.\n\nThat simplifies things.\n\nFor all cars, since right-moving, span at t1 is [τ, h] and at T is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nAnd collision if player on that freeway at turn T and 0 is in [τ + s(T-22), h + s(T-22)] for some car on that freeway.\n\nNow, since multiple cars per freeway, for each freeway, I need to see if 0 is in any of the spans at time T.\n\nNow, player starts at y=5 at turn 22.\n\nI need to reach y=9. Since y=9 has no cars, once I'm at y=9, I'm safe, but I need to be at (0,9) at some turn, and since no cars, I can be there.\n\nThe position is (0,y), and when I reach y=9, I'm done, regardless of turn.\n\nBut I need to avoid collision on the way.\n\nNow, minimal H, so I want to go up as fast as possible, but I might need to wait if there's a car at x=0.\n\nSince I can only change y by ±1 or 0 each turn, and I need to go from 5 to 9, minimum 4 turns if I go up each time, but only if no collisions.\n\nI need to check for each freeway between y=5 to y=8, since y=1 to 8 have cars, but when I'm moving, I might be on different y's.\n\nI should simulate the possible paths.\n\nFirst, let's list for each freeway the cars and their spans over time.\n\nt1=22.\n\nDefine Δt = T - 22, so for time T, Δt ≥ 0.\n\nFor a car with τ, h, s, right-moving, span at T is [τ + s*Δt, h + s*Δt]\n\n0 is in span if τ + s*Δt ≤ 0 ≤ h + s*Δt\n\nSince the car is moving right, and s>0, the span is shifting right.\n\nNow for each freeway, multiple cars, so 0 is occupied if for any car, τ + s*Δt ≤ 0 ≤ h + s*Δt.\n\nOtherwise, free.\n\nNow, player is on freeway y at turn T if after the action, but at turn T, the position y_T is where you are for collision check.\n\nLet's clarify the timing.\n\nAt turn T, the player is at position y_T.\n\nThen, based on action a_T, y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy_T.\n\nThen at turn T+1, player is at y_{T+1}, and we check for collision on freeway y_{T+1} at that turn? No.\n\nThe collision definition: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\ny_T is the player's y-position at turn T.\n\nSo at turn T, player is on freeway y_T, and we check if for that freeway, at time T, 0 is in some car's span.\n\nThe note says: if you move to a new y at turn T, you are not on that new y until the next turn. But for the collision check, at turn T, you are on y_T, regardless of where you came from.\n\nThe note is about when you are considered on the freeway. At turn T, you are on y_T for that turn.\n\nIf you move at turn T, say from y to y+1, then at turn T, before moving, you were on y, and after action, you are now at y+1 for turn T+1.\n\nBut at turn T, for collision, you are on y_T.\n\nLet me read the note carefully.\n\n\"Note that if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_{T} at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nThis is a bit confusing.\n\nIt says: if at turn T, you move to a different y, then at turn T, you are not on y_{T+1}, so even if at turn T, on freeway y_{T+1}, 0 is in span, but since you are not on it at turn T, no collision. But at turn T, for freeway y_{T+1}, if 0 is in span, but you are not on that freeway at turn T, so no issue.\n\nThe collision is only for the freeway you are currently on at that turn.\n\nSo at turn T, you are on freeway y_T.\n\nCars on freeway y_T are checked at time T.\n\nIf you are not on a freeway, no check, like at y=0 or y=9.\n\nIn this case, at turn T, after action, y_{T+1} is set, but for turn T, y_T is the position before action or after?\n\nLet's see the player update.\n\nPlayer update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, where Δy_t depends on a_t.\n\nAnd a_t is the action at turn t.\n\nSo at turn t, you perform action a_t, which determines Δy_t, and then y_{t+1} is the new position for the next turn.\n\nBut for collision at turn t, it depends on y_t, your current position at the start of the turn or something?\n\nThe collision is defined for turn T, and it says \"at turn T\", with player position y_T.\n\nI think y_T is the position at turn T, meaning before the action or at the time of the turn.\n\nTypically in such games, at the beginning of turn T, player is at position (0, y_T), then you choose action a_T, which may change y for the next turn.\n\nThen during turn T, you are at y_T, and collision is checked based on that.\n\nAfter action, you move to y_{T+1} for turn T+1.\n\nThe note confirms this: if you move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, at turn T you are on y_T, not on y_{T+1}, so cars on y_{T+1} at turn T don't affect you.\n\nAt turn T+1, you are on y_{T+1}, and cars on y_{T+1} at turn T+1 are checked.\n\nSo for collision at turn T, it depends on y_T and the car spans at time T on freeway y_T.\n\nNow, back to the cars.\n\nI need to find for each freeway and for each time, whether x=0 is occupied.\n\nSince the spans are moving, I can find for each freeway the times when 0 is occupied.\n\nThen, for the player path, at each turn T, when on freeway k, it must be that at time T, 0 is not occupied on freeway k.\n\nOtherwise, collision.\n\nPlayer starts at turn 22, y=5.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\nPossible actions: U, D, S.\n\nI should consider the state (turn, y) and see when I can be there without collision.\n\nSince I want minimal turns, I can try to go up as fast as possible and see if there's a collision, and if so, wait or detour.\n\nBut since all cars are moving right, and player is at x=0, I need to find when 0 is free on each row.\n\nFirst, let's list for each freeway the cars and find the times when 0 is covered.\n\nFreeway 1: k=1, cars: one car: (h=48, τ=25, d=right, s=24)\n\nSince right, span at t1=22: [τ, h] = [25, 48]\n\nAt time T, span: [25 + 24*(T-22), 48 + 24*(T-22)]\n\n0 in span if 25 + 24*(T-22) ≤ 0 ≤ 48 + 24*(T-22)\n\nSince 25 + 24*dt ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ 48 + 24*dt, but 48 + 24*dt is always positive for dt≥0, so only need 25 + 24*dt ≤ 0\n\n25 + 24*dt ≤ 0 ⇒ 24*dt ≤ -25 ⇒ dt ≤ -25/24, which is negative, impossible. So 0 is never in span for freeway 1? Let's see.\n\n25 + 24*dt ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ 48 + 24*dt.\n\n0 ≤ 48 + 24*dt is always true for dt≥0.\n\n25 + 24*dt ≤ 0 ⇒ 24*dt ≤ -25 ⇒ dt ≤ -25/24 <0, impossible.\n\nSo the inequality 25 + 24*dt ≤ 0 ≤ 48 + 24*dt cannot hold because left part is always >0. 25 + 24*dt ≥ 25 >0 for dt≥0, so 0 < 25 + 24*dt ≤ 0 is false, so 0 is never ≤ the lower bound, so 0 not in [low, high] since low >0.\n\nSimilarly, high > low >0, so x=0 is left of the car, not covered.\n\nSo for freeway 1, at all times, x=0 is free, no car covers it.\n\nIs that right? Car span [25,48] at t1, moving right, so it starts at x=25 to 48, and moves to higher x, so x=0 is always to the left, never covered. Yes.\n\nSo freeway 1 is always safe at x=0.\n\nNow freeway 2: k=2, cars: one car: (24, -11, right, 36)\n\nh=24, τ=-11, d=right, s=36\n\nSpan at t1: [τ, h] = [-11, 24]\n\nAt T: [-11 + 36*(T-22), 24 + 36*(T-22)]\n\n0 in span if -11 + 36*dt ≤ 0 ≤ 24 + 36*dt\n\nNow, -11 + 36*dt ≤ 0 ⇒ 36*dt ≤ 11 ⇒ dt ≤ 11/36 ≈ 0.305, so dt=0 possible? dt integer, turns.\n\ndt = T-22, integer.\n\nAt dt=0: low = -11 + 0 = -11 ≤ 0, high=24+0=24 ≥0, yes, 0 in [-11,24]\n\nAt dt=1: low = -11+36=25? -11 + 36*1 = 25, high=24+36=60, [25,60], 0 not in, since 0<25.\n\nAt dt=0, T=22, low=-11, high=24, 0 is between -11 and 24? -11 ≤ 0 ≤ 24, yes.\n\nAt dt=1, T=23, low=-11+36=25, high=24+36=60, [25,60], 0<25, not in.\n\nFor dt>1, even higher, not.\n\nSo only at dt=0, T=22, 0 is covered.\n\nFor T=22, on freeway 2, 0 is occupied.\n\nBut at other times, free.\n\nNow freeway 3: k=3, same as freeway 2? Cars: (24, -11, right, 36) identical to freeway 2.\n\nSo same thing: at T=22, 0 covered, else free.\n\nFreeway 4: also (24, -11, right, 36), same as above.\n\nSo freeways 2,3,4 all have 0 occupied only at T=22.\n\nNow freeway 5: k=5, three cars:\n\nCar 1: (-6, -17, right, 6)\n\nCar 2: (-42, -53, right, 6)\n\nCar 3: (36, 25, right, 6)\n\nAll right-moving, s=6.\n\nFirst car: h=-6, τ=-17? Let's see.\n\nHead h, tail τ.\n\nFor car 1: h=-6, τ=-17, d=right, s=6\n\nSince right, span at t1: [τ, h] = [-17, -6]\n\nAt T: [-17 + 6*dt, -6 + 6*dt]\n\n0 in span if -17 +6*dt ≤ 0 ≤ -6 +6*dt\n\nWhich is -17 +6*dt ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ -6 +6*dt\n\nFirst: -17 +6*dt ≤ 0 ⇒ 6*dt ≤ 17 ⇒ dt ≤ 17/6 ≈ 2.833, so dt≤2\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -6 +6*dt ⇒ 6*dt ≥ 6 ⇒ dt ≥1\n\nSo for dt=1 and dt=2.\n\nAt dt=1: low=-17+6= -11, high=-6+6=0, [-11,0], 0 ≤ 0, so 0 is included, since it says ≤ and ≥, so closed interval, 0 is in if low ≤ 0 ≤ high.\n\nAt high=0, 0≤0, yes.\n\nSimilarly, low≤0.\n\nAt dt=1: low=-17+6= -11, high=-6+6=0, so [ -11, 0 ], 0 is the right endpoint, so 0 is in the span.\n\nAt dt=2: low=-17+12= -5, high=-6+12=6, [ -5, 6 ], 0 in.\n\nAt dt=0: low=-17, high=-6, [ -17, -6 ], both negative, 0 not in.\n\nAt dt=3: low=-17+18=1, high=-6+18=12, [1,12], 0<1, not in.\n\nSo car 1 covers 0 at dt=1 and dt=2, i.e., T=23 and T=24.\n\nNow car 2: (-42, -53, right, 6)\n\nh=-42, τ=-53, d=right, s=6\n\nSpan at t1: [τ, h] = [-53, -42]\n\nAt T: [-53 +6*dt, -42 +6*dt]\n\n0 in span if -53 +6*dt ≤ 0 ≤ -42 +6*dt\n\nFirst: -53 +6*dt ≤ 0 ⇒ 6*dt ≤ 53 ⇒ dt ≤ 53/6 ≈ 8.833, dt≤8\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -42 +6*dt ⇒ 6*dt ≥42 ⇒ dt ≥7\n\nSo for dt=7,8\n\nAt dt=7: low=-53+42= -11, high=-42+42=0, [ -11, 0 ], 0 in\n\nAt dt=8: low=-53+48= -5, high=-42+48=6, [ -5, 6 ], 0 in\n\nAt dt=6: low=-53+36= -17, high=-42+36= -6, [ -17, -6 ], 0 not in\n\nAt dt=9: low=-53+54=1, high=-42+54=12, [1,12], 0 not in\n\nSo car 2 covers 0 at dt=7 and 8, T=29 and 30.\n\nNow car 3: (36, 25, right, 6)\n\nh=36, τ=25, d=right, s=6\n\nSpan at t1: [τ, h] = [25, 36]\n\nAt T: [25 +6*dt, 36 +6*dt]\n\n0 in span? low=25+6*dt ≥25>0, so 0 < low, not in span. Always free.\n\nSo for freeway 5, 0 is covered when car 1 or car 2 covers it.\n\nCar 1 at dt=1,2 (T=23,24)\n\nCar 2 at dt=7,8 (T=29,30)\n\nSo at T=23,24,29,30, 0 is occupied on freeway 5.\n\nOther times free.\n\nNow freeway 6: k=6, same as freeway 5? Cars: (-6, -17, right, 6), (-42, -53, right, 6), (36, 25, right, 6)\n\nIdentical to freeway 5.\n\nSo same: 0 occupied at T=23,24,29,30.\n\nNow freeway 7: k=7, one car: (48, 37, right, 12)\n\nh=48, τ=37, d=right, s=12\n\nSpan at t1: [τ, h] = [37, 48]\n\nAt T: [37 +12*dt, 48 +12*dt]\n\nlow=37+12*dt >0, so 0 never in span. Always free.\n\nNow freeway 8: k=8, one car: (-24, -35, right, 4)\n\nh=-24, τ=-35, d=right, s=4\n\nSpan at t1: [τ, h] = [-35, -24]\n\nAt T: [-35 +4*dt, -24 +4*dt]\n\n0 in span if -35 +4*dt ≤ 0 ≤ -24 +4*dt\n\nFirst: -35 +4*dt ≤ 0 ⇒ 4*dt ≤35 ⇒ dt ≤ 35/4 = 8.75, dt≤8\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -24 +4*dt ⇒ 4*dt ≥24 ⇒ dt ≥6\n\nSo for dt=6,7,8\n\nAt dt=6: low=-35+24= -11, high=-24+24=0, [ -11, 0 ], 0 in\n\nAt dt=7: low=-35+28= -7, high=-24+28=4, [ -7, 4 ], 0 in\n\nAt dt=8: low=-35+32= -3, high=-24+32=8, [ -3, 8 ], 0 in\n\nAt dt=5: low=-35+20= -15, high=-24+20= -4, [ -15, -4 ], both neg, 0 not in\n\nAt dt=9: low=-35+36=1, high=-24+36=12, [1,12], 0 not in\n\nSo freeway 8 has 0 occupied at dt=6,7,8 i.e. T=28,29,30.\n\nT=22 + dt, so dt=6: T=28, dt=7: T=29, dt=8: T=30.\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway when x=0 is occupied (collision if player there):\n\nFreeway 1: never occupied, always safe.\n\nFreeway 2: occupied at T=22 only (since dt=0)\n\nFreeway 3: occupied at T=22 only\n\nFreeway 4: occupied at T=22 only\n\nFreeway 5: occupied at T=23,24,29,30\n\nFreeway 6: occupied at T=23,24,29,30\n\nFreeway 7: never occupied, always safe\n\nFreeway 8: occupied at T=28,29,30\n\nPlayer starts at turn 22, y=5.\n\nAt turn 22, if player is on y=5, which is freeway 5, but at T=22, is 0 occupied on freeway 5?\n\nFor freeway 5, we have occupied at T=23,24,29,30, not at T=22.\n\nAt T=22, dt=0, for car 1: [ -17, -6 ], not include 0\n\nCar 2: [ -53, -42 ], not\n\nCar 3: [25,36], not\n\nSo at T=22, freeway 5 is free.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6 same.\n\nBut at turn 22, player is on y=5, freeway 5, which is free at T=22, so no collision.\n\nNow, I need to go to y=9.\n\ny=9 has no cars, so once there, safe.\n\nMinimal turns: from y=5 to y=9, need +4 in y, so at least 4 turns if I go up each turn.\n\nCan I go up directly?\n\nStart at T=22, y=5, free, safe.\n\nAction at T=22: if I go U, then y_{23} = 5 +1 =6\n\nAt turn T=23, player is at y=6.\n\nNow, y=6, freeway 6.\n\nAt T=23, freeway 6 occupied? Yes, from above, T=23 is occupied for freeway 6.\n\nSo if I am at y=6 at T=23, collision.\n\nIf I go S at T=22, stay at y=5 for T=23.\n\nAt T=23, y=5, freeway 5.\n\nFreeway 5 at T=23 occupied? Yes, T=23 is one of the occupied times.\n\nSo at T=23, if on y=5 or y=6, both occupied? y=5 at T=23: freeway 5 occupied at T=23.\n\ny=6 at T=23: freeway 6 occupied.\n\nBut I can go to other y.\n\nAt T=22, I can choose action.\n\nOptions at T=22:\n\n- U: to y=6 for T=23\n\n- D: to y=4 for T=23\n\n- S: stay y=5 for T=23\n\nNow, at T=23, y=6: occupied, collision\n\ny=5: occupied, collision\n\ny=4: what is freeway 4 at T=23?\n\nFreeway 4: from above, occupied only at T=22, not at T=23.\n\nAt T=23, dt=1, for freeway 4 car: (24,-11,right,36) at dt=1: [-11+36, 24+36] = [25,60], 0 not in, free.\n\nSo if I go to y=4 at T=23, it should be safe.\n\nSimilarly, other options.\n\nBut I need to go to y=9.\n\nIf I go down to y=4, that might not help, but I can go later.\n\nSince freeways 1 and 7 are always safe, and y=0 and y=9 safe.\n\ny=0 is safe, but I need to go up.\n\nPlan a path.\n\nI need to reach y=9 with minimal turns.\n\nSince from T=23 to T=24, freeway 5 and 6 are occupied, so I cannot be on y=5 or 6 at T=23 or T=24.\n\nAt T=23: cannot be on y=5 or 6\n\nAt T=24: freeway 5 and 6 occupied, so cannot be on y=5 or 6.\n\nAlso at T=22, if I stay or go up, I might be in trouble at T=23.\n\nAt T=22, I must avoid being on y=5 or 6 at T=23 and T=24.\n\nBut at T=22, I am at y=5.\n\nAction at T=22:\n\nIf I go U, at T=23 I am at y=6, which is occupied, collision.\n\nIf I go S, at T=23 at y=5, occupied, collision.\n\nIf I go D, at T=23 at y=4, which is free at T=23, as above.\n\nSo only safe action at T=22 is D, to y=4 for T=23.\n\nThen at T=23, I am at y=4.\n\nNow, at T=23, I need to choose action.\n\ny=4 is freeway 4, which at T=23 is free, as above.\n\nNow, I can go U, D, or S.\n\nIf I go U, to y=5 for T=24.\n\nBut at T=24, y=5: freeway 5 occupied, collision.\n\nIf I go S, stay y=4 for T=24.\n\nAt T=24, freeway 4: is it occupied?\n\nFreeway 4: car (24,-11,right,36), at dt=2, T=24: [-11+72, 24+72]? dt=2, T=22+2=24.\n\nlow = τ + s*dt = -11 + 36*2 = -11 +72=61, high=24+72=96, [61,96], 0 not in, free.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 4 is only occupied at T=22, not after.\n\nSo at T=24, y=4 is free.\n\nBut if I stay at y=4, I need to go to y=9 eventually.\n\nIf I go D, to y=3 for T=24.\n\ny=3, freeway 3.\n\nAt T=24, freeway 3: similar to freeway 4, occupied only at T=22, not at T=24, so free.\n\nBut going down might delay.\n\nBack to T=23, at y=4.\n\nI need to go up, but at T=24, if I go to y=5, collision because freeway 5 occupied.\n\nSimilarly, y=6 occupied.\n\nWhat about y=7 or others?\n\nAt T=24, freeway 7 is always free, freeway 1 free, etc.\n\nBut from y=4, I can go to y=3,4,5.\n\ny=5 at T=24 occupied.\n\nSo I should not go to y=5.\n\nI can stay at y=4 or go to y=3.\n\nBut let's see later times.\n\nSince freeway 5 and 6 are occupied until T=24, and then free until T=29,30, which is later.\n\nAfter T=24, freeway 5 and 6 are free until T=29.\n\nT=23 and 24 occupied, then T=25 to 28 free? For freeway 5, occupied at T=23,24,29,30.\n\nSimilarly freeway 6.\n\nT=25 to 28 should be free for y=5 and 6.\n\nAt T=29 and 30 occupied.\n\nAlso freeway 8 occupied at T=28,29,30.\n\nBut y=8 is freeway 8.\n\nNow, back to player.\n\nAt T=22, I go D, to y=4 at T=23.\n\nNow at T=23, I am at y=4, free.\n\nNow action at T=23: I can go S or D, not U to avoid y=5 at T=24.\n\nIf I go S, to y=4 at T=24.\n\nAt T=24, y=4 free, as above.\n\nThen at T=24, I can go U to y=5, but at T=25? Let's see.\n\nAt turn T, action a_T determines y_{T+1}.\n\nAt T=24, if I go U, y_{25} = y_24 +1, but y_24 is the position at turn 24.\n\nAt T=23, if I go S, then at T=24 I am at y=4.\n\nThen at T=24, I choose action.\n\nIf I go U at T=24, then y_{25} = 4 +1 =5, so at turn T=25, I am at y=5.\n\nNow at T=25, y=5, freeway 5.\n\nAt T=25, is 0 occupied? T=25, dt=3, for freeway 5.\n\nEarlier, for freeway 5, occupied at T=23,24,29,30.\n\nT=25 not occupied, so free.\n\nSimilarly, I can go up.\n\nBut let's see the sequence.\n\nStart:\n\nT=22: at y=5, action must be D to go to y=4 at T=23.\n\nT=23: at y=4, now I need to choose action.\n\nIf I go U at T=23, then y_{24} =4+1=5, so at T=24, I am at y=5.\n\nBut at T=24, freeway 5 is occupied, collision! Because at turn T=24, on y=5, and occupied.\n\nSo cannot go U at T=23.\n\nIf I go D at T=23, to y=3 at T=24.\n\ny=3, freeway 3.\n\nAt T=24, freeway 3: as before, only occupied at T=22, so at T=24 free.\n\nSafe.\n\nIf I go S at T=23, to y=4 at T=24, also safe.\n\nBut I need to go up eventually.\n\nNow, from y=4 at T=24, I can go U to y=5 at T=25, which is safe since T=25 free for y=5.\n\nSimilarly, I can go directly.\n\nBut let's list the turns.\n\nAlso, I need to reach y=9.\n\ny=9 is safe.\n\nNow, from y=5 to y=9, need 4 steps up.\n\nBut with delays.\n\nIn this case, at T=22: D to y=4 at T=23\n\nT=23: now at y=4, I can go S to stay at y=4 for T=24, or D to y=3 for T=24.\n\nIf I go D to y=3, then at T=24 at y=3, which is free, then I need to go up, but y=3 is freeway 3, which is safe except T=22, but T=24 is fine.\n\nBut going down might take more turns.\n\nBetter to stay or go up when possible.\n\nAt T=23, if I go S, to y=4 at T=24\n\nThen at T=24, at y=4, I go U to y=5 at T=25\n\nT=25: at y=5, free (since T=25 not occupied), so I can go U to y=6 at T=26\n\nT=26: at y=6, freeway 6.\n\nAt T=26, dt=4, freeway 6 occupied at T=23,24,29,30, not at T=26, so free.\n\nGo U to y=7 at T=27\n\nT=27: at y=7, freeway 7, always free, go U to y=8 at T=28\n\nT=28: at y=8, freeway 8.\n\nNow, freeway 8 occupied at T=28,29,30.\n\nAt T=28, occupied, so if I am at y=8 at T=28, collision.\n\nProblem.\n\nAt T=27, if I go U to y=8 at T=28, collision.\n\nSo I need to avoid being on y=8 at T=28,29,30.\n\nSimilarly, at T=28, I cannot be on y=8.\n\nNow, what can I do?\n\nAt T=27, I am at y=7.\n\nInstead of going U, I can stay or go down, but I need to go up.\n\ny=7 is safe, I can stay there until free.\n\nFreeway 8 occupied at T=28,29,30, so after T=30, it should be free.\n\nT=31, dt=9, for freeway 8: at dt=9, low=-35+36=1, high=-24+36=12, [1,12], 0 not in, free.\n\nSimilarly, T=31 and after free.\n\nBut that might take more turns.\n\nI could go to y=9 directly from y=7 or something.\n\ny=7 to y=9 need two steps.\n\nBut at T=28, if I go to y=8, collision.\n\nOptions at T=27: at y=7.\n\nI can go U to y=8 at T=28, but collision.\n\nGo S to stay y=7 at T=28.\n\ny=7 at T=28: freeway 7 always free, safe.\n\nThen at T=28, I am at y=7.\n\nThen I can go U to y=8 at T=29.\n\nBut at T=29, y=8: freeway 8 occupied at T=29, collision.\n\nSimilarly, if I go to y=8 at T=30, occupied.\n\nSo I need to be on y=8 at T=31 or later.\n\nAt T=28, I am at y=7, I can stay or go down, but not good.\n\nSince freeway 1 is always safe, I could go down to lower rows, but that might not help.\n\nAnother idea: go to y=9 from y=7 in one step? No, only ±1 per turn.\n\nActions U,D,S, so y changes by +1, -1, 0.\n\nSo from y=7, to y=8, then to y=9.\n\nBut y=8 is problematic at T=28,29,30.\n\nSo I need to be on y=8 when free, i.e., not at T=28,29,30.\n\nSo at T=31 or after.\n\nBut I can reach earlier if I go faster to y=7 or something.\n\nLet's list the current path so far.\n\nFrom start:\n\nT=22: action D, to y=4 at T=23\n\nT=23: action S (stay), to y=4 at T=24? At T=23 action.\n\nAt T=23, if I do S, then y_{24} = y_23 =4, so at T=24, y=4.\n\nThen T=24: action U, to y=5 at T=25\n\nT=25: at y=5, action U, to y=6 at T=26\n\nT=26: at y=6, action U, to y=7 at T=27\n\nT=27: at y=7, now if I go U, to y=8 at T=28, but collision at T=28.\n\nSo I need to wait at y=7 or something.\n\nAt T=27, I can do S, to stay at y=7 for T=28.\n\nThen at T=28, at y=7, I can do S again to stay at y=7 for T=29.\n\nBut at T=29, if I go U to y=8 at T=30, but T=30 y=8 occupied.\n\nAt T=29, if I go U, y_{30} = y_29 +1, but at T=29, I am at y=7 if I stayed.\n\nSet:\n\nAfter T=27: at y=7, turn T=27.\n\nAction at T=27: if S, then y_{28} =7, so at T=28, y=7, free, safe.\n\nThen at T=28, action: if S, y_{29}=7, at T=29 y=7, safe.\n\nThen at T=29, action U, y_{30} =7+1=8, so at T=30, y=8.\n\nBut at T=30, freeway 8 occupied, collision.\n\nIf at T=29, I do not U, but S or D, then I stay at y=7, not progress.\n\nTo avoid T=30, I need to be at y=8 later.\n\nAt T=28, instead of staying, I could go U to y=8 at T=29, but T=29 occupied.\n\nSame.\n\nGo to y=8 at T=31.\n\nHow?\n\nAt T=27: S, to y=7 at T=28\n\nT=28: S, to y=7 at T=29\n\nT=29: S, to y=7 at T=30\n\nThen at T=30: U, to y=8 at T=31\n\nT=31: at y=8, now freeway 8 at T=31: dt=9, [ -35+36, -24+36] = [1,12], 0 not in, free. Safe.\n\nThen at T=31: U, to y=9 at T=32\n\nT=32: at y=9, done.\n\nBut this is many turns: from T=22 to T=32, 10 turns, but I started at T=22, actions from t=22 to t=31? Let's count.\n\nPlayer position at turn T:\n\nT=22: y=5\n\nAfter action a_22: D, so y_23 =4\n\nT=23: y=4, action S, so y_24=4\n\nT=24: y=4, action U, y_25=5\n\nT=25: y=5, action U, y_26=6\n\nT=26: y=6, action U, y_27=7\n\nT=27: y=7, action S, y_28=7\n\nT=28: y=7, action S, y_29=7\n\nT=29: y=7, action S, y_30=7\n\nT=30: y=7, action U, y_31=8\n\nT=31: y=8, action U, y_32=9\n\nT=32: at y=9, done.\n\nNumber of actions: from t=22 to t=31, that's 10 actions? Turns: actions at t=22 to t=31 for H=10 turns? H is the number of turns, I think.\n\nThe sequence of actions from t_1 to t_1 + H-1 for H turns.\n\nStart at t_1=22, after H turns, at turn t_1 + H -1, position should be (0,9).\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t to t+H-1, and after H actions, at turn t+H, position y_{t+H}.\n\nLet's see.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t.\n\nAfter action a_t, y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nThen at turn t+1, position y_{t+1}, and so on.\n\nWe start at turn t_1=22, y_22=5.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t_1 + H, y_{t_1 + H} should be 9? No.\n\nThe position after H actions is at turn t_1 + H.\n\nBut the turn when we reach (0,9) is at some turn T, and we stop.\n\nThe minimal H such that after H actions, we are at y=9.\n\nIn the sequence, actions {a_t for t=t_1 to t_1 + H-1}, and after H actions, at turn t_1 + H, position should be (0,9).\n\nFor example, if no cars, from y=5 to y=9, actions U,U,U,U at t=22,23,24,25, then at t=26, y=9.\n\nH=4 actions, from t=22 to t=25, and at t=26, y=9.\n\nYes.\n\nIn this case, with cars, we have delays.\n\nIn my earlier path, I have actions from t=22 to t=31, 10 actions? t=22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31, that's 10 actions.\n\nAfter 10 actions, at t=32, y=9.\n\nBut H=10.\n\nBut I think I can do better.\n\nBecause I stayed at y=7 for several turns.\n\nBut y=5 and 6 are free after T=24 until T=29.\n\nIn my path, I went to y=7 at T=27.\n\nAt T=27, y=7.\n\nInstead of waiting, I could go to y=8 earlier, but cannot because of occupation.\n\nSince freeway 1 is always safe, I could go down to y=1 or something, but that might take more turns to go up.\n\nFor example, from y=4 at T=24, instead of going up to y=5, I could go down to y=3, but not useful.\n\nAnother idea: at T=22, I go D to y=4 at T=23.\n\nThen at T=23, instead of S or D, I could go to other directions, but only U,D,S.\n\nPerhaps I can go up faster by skipping the occupied times.\n\nFor example, at T=23, I am at y=4.\n\nI can go U to y=5 at T=24, but T=24 y=5 occupied, cannot.\n\nUnless I go to a different y.\n\nBut from y=4, I can only go to y=3,4,5.\n\ny=5 occupied at T=24.\n\nSo I must not be on y=5 at T=24.\n\nSimilarly, at T=23, I must not be on y=5 or 6.\n\nBut at T=23, I am at y=4, which is safe.\n\nNow, at T=24, I need to be on a safe y.\n\nAt T=24, which y are safe?\n\nFreeway 1: always safe\n\nFreeway 2: occupied only T=22, so T=24 safe\n\nFreeway 3: same, safe\n\nFreeway 4: safe\n\nFreeway 5: occupied, not safe\n\nFreeway 6: occupied, not safe\n\nFreeway 7: always safe\n\nFreeway 8: occupied at T=28,29,30, not at T=24, dt=2, for freeway 8: at dt=2, low=-35+8= -27, high=-24+8= -16, both negative, not cover 0, so safe.\n\nSo at T=24, safe y: 1,2,3,4,7,8 (since 5 and 6 occupied)\n\ny=0 and y=9 also safe, but y=0 is below.\n\nPlayer at T=24, I will be at some y depending on action at T=23.\n\nAt T=23, I am at y=4.\n\nAction at T=23:\n\n- U: to y=5 at T=24, but y=5 occupied at T=24, collision\n\n- S: to y=4 at T=24, safe\n\n- D: to y=3 at T=24, safe\n\nSo I can do S or D.\n\nIf S, to y=4 at T=24.\n\nThen at T=24, at y=4.\n\nThen I can go U to y=5 at T=25, which is safe, as before.\n\nSimilarly, if at T=23 I go D, to y=3 at T=24.\n\ny=3 at T=24 is safe.\n\nThen at T=24, I can go U to y=4 at T=25, or directly to y=5? From y=3, U to y=4 at T=25.\n\nThen to y=5 at T=26, etc.\n\nBut similar to before.\n\nNow, to reach y=9 faster, I need to go up when possible.\n\nBut the bottleneck is y=8 at T=28,29,30 occupied.\n\nSo I need to be at y=8 before T=28 or after T=30.\n\nBefore T=28: T=27 or earlier.\n\nBut at T=27, if I am at y=7, I can go to y=8 at T=28, but T=28 occupied.\n\nIf I am at y=8 at T=27, but from below, I need to reach y=8 earlier.\n\nLet's see how fast I can reach y=7 or y=8.\n\nStart T=22: y=5, action D, to y=4 at T=23\n\nT=23: at y=4, action S, to y=4 at T=24 (or D to y=3, but let's assume S)\n\nT=24: at y=4, action U, to y=5 at T=25\n\nT=25: at y=5, action U, to y=6 at T=26\n\nT=26: at y=6, action U, to y=7 at T=27\n\nNow T=27: at y=7\n\nI want to go to y=8, but cannot at T=28 because occupied.\n\nEarliest I can be at y=8 is T=31, as before.\n\nBut let's see if I can be at y=7 earlier.\n\nAt T=22, I am at y=5.\n\nIf I could go up at T=22, but I couldn't because at T=23 y=6 occupied, and y=5 occupied.\n\nBut freeway 7 is always safe, so if I can go to y=7 faster.\n\nHow?\n\nFor example, from y=5 at T=22, I go D to y=4 at T=23.\n\nThen at T=23, instead of S, I go U? But to y=5 at T=24, occupied.\n\nNo.\n\nAt T=23, I go D to y=3 at T=24.\n\nThen at T=24, at y=3, I can go U to y=4 at T=25, then U to y=5 at T=26, U to y=6 at T=27, U to y=7 at T=28.\n\nT=28: at y=7.\n\nThen I can go U to y=8 at T=29, but T=29 y=8 occupied.\n\nSame issue.\n\nFrom y=3 at T=24, I could go directly to higher, but no, only step by step.\n\nAnother idea: go to y=1 or y=2 which are safe.\n\nFor example, at T=22: D to y=4 at T=23\n\nT=23: D to y=3 at T=24\n\nT=24: D to y=2 at T=25? y=2 freeway 2, at T=25: free, since only occupied at T=22.\n\nThen T=25: at y=2, go U to y=3 at T=26\n\nT=26: at y=3, U to y=4 at T=27\n\nT=27: at y=4, U to y=5 at T=28\n\nT=28: at y=5, but freeway 5 at T=28: dt=6, T=22+6=28, for freeway 5, occupied at T=23,24,29,30, not at T=28, so free. Safe.\n\nThen T=28: U to y=6 at T=29\n\nT=29: at y=6, freeway 6 at T=29: occupied? T=29 is occupied for freeway 6, since T=29 is one of the occupied times. Freeway 6 occupied at T=23,24,29,30.\n\nT=29 occupied, so collision if on y=6 at T=29.\n\nProblem.\n\nIf at T=28, I am at y=5, I could go U to y=6 at T=29, but T=29 y=6 occupied.\n\nOr stay at y=5, but need to go up.\n\nAt T=29, freeway 5 occupied? T=29 for freeway 5: occupied at T=29, yes, so y=5 also occupied at T=29.\n\nT=29, both y=5 and 6 occupied.\n\nSo I cannot be on y=5 or 6 at T=29.\n\nSimilarly at T=30.\n\nSo in the path, when I reach y=5 at T=28, I cannot go up at T=28 because to y=6 at T=29 occupied, or stay at y=5 at T=29 occupied.\n\nSo I need to be not on y=5 or 6 at T=29 and T=30.\n\nSimilarly for y=8 at T=28,29,30.\n\nBut y=8 is different freeway.\n\nTo minimize turns, I should go to y=7 as soon as possible and wait there, since y=7 is always safe.\n\nThen go to y=8 after T=30.\n\nEarliest to reach y=7.\n\nFrom start:\n\nT=22: D to y=4 at T=23 (must, to avoid collision at T=23)\n\nT=23: at y=4, now to reach y=7, I need to go up three times.\n\nBut I cannot go up immediately because of T=24 occupation.\n\nAt T=23, I can do S or D.\n\nIf I do S at T=23, to y=4 at T=24\n\nThen at T=24, U to y=5 at T=25\n\nT=25: U to y=6 at T=26\n\nT=26: U to y=7 at T=27\n\nSo at T=27, y=7.\n\nIf at T=23 I do D to y=3 at T=24, then T=24 U to y=4 at T=25, T=25 U to y=5 at T=26, T=26 U to y=6 at T=27, T=27 U to y=7 at T=28, later.\n\nSo earliest y=7 at T=27.\n\nThen from T=27, I can stay at y=7 until T=30, then go to y=8 at T=31, y=9 at T=32.\n\nActions:\n\nt=22: D\n\nt=23: S (or could be D, but S is better)\n\nt=24: U\n\nt=25: U\n\nt=26: U\n\nt=27: S (stay at y=7 for T=28)\n\nt=28: S (stay for T=29)\n\nt=29: S (stay for T=30)\n\nt=30: U to y=8 at T=31\n\nt=31: U to y=9 at T=32\n\nThen at T=32, y=9.\n\nNumber of actions: from t=22 to t=31, 10 actions.\n\nH=10.\n\nBut can I reduce?\n\nFor example, at T=27, I am at y=7, and I need to wait until T=30 to go to y=8.\n\nBut at T=28,29,30, y=8 is occupied, but I could be on other rows, but I am at y=7, which is safe.\n\nIs there a way to reach y=8 before T=28?\n\nT=27: if I could be at y=7 at T=26, then go U at T=26 to y=8 at T=27.\n\nBut at T=27, freeway 8: is it occupied?\n\nFreeway 8 occupied at T=28,29,30, not at T=27.\n\nT=27, dt=5, for freeway 8: low=-35+20= -15, high=-24+20= -4, both negative, not cover 0, free.\n\nSo at T=27, y=8 is free.\n\nIf I can be at y=7 at T=26, then at T=26 I can go U to y=8 at T=27.\n\nThen at T=27, y=8, free, safe.\n\nThen at T=27, I can go U to y=9 at T=28.\n\nT=28: at y=9, done.\n\nBut can I be at y=7 at T=26?\n\nLet's see.\n\nStart T=22: y=5, must go D to y=4 at T=23 to avoid collision.\n\nT=23: at y=4, if I go U, to y=5 at T=24, but T=24 y=5 occupied, cannot.\n\nIf I go S, to y=4 at T=24, then U at T=24 to y=5 at T=25, then U at T=25 to y=6 at T=26, then at T=26 I am at y=6, not y=7.\n\nTo be at y=7 at T=26, I need to be at y=6 at T=25 or something.\n\nAt T=25, y=6: but freeway 6 at T=25? T=25, dt=3, freeway 6 occupied at T=23,24,29,30, not at T=25, so free.\n\nBut how to be at y=6 at T=25.\n\nFrom start:\n\nT=22: D to y=4 at T=23\n\nT=23: at y=4, I need to go to y=6 by T=25? y_{25} =6.\n\ny_{25} depends on actions.\n\nAt T=23, if I go U, y_{24} =5, but at T=24 y=5 occupied, collision.\n\nCannot go U at T=23.\n\nIf I go S, y_{24} =4\n\nThen at T=24, go U, y_{25} =5\n\nThen at T=25, go U, y_{26} =6\n\nSo at T=26, y=6.\n\nThen to be at y=7 at T=27, go U at T=26 to y=7 at T=27.\n\nBut I need y=7 at T=26 for the earlier plan.\n\nAt T=26, I am at y=6, after action U, y_{27}=7.\n\nBut at T=26, position is y=6.\n\nTo have y=7 at T=26, I need y_{26} =7, which means at T=25, after action, y_{26} = y_{25} + Δy_{25}, so at T=25, I need to be at y=6 or y=7 and go U or S.\n\nBut at T=25, if I am at y=6, I can go U to y=7 at T=26.\n\nBut how to be at y=6 at T=25.\n\nFrom above, earliest: T=25 at y=5, then U to y=6 at T=26.\n\ny_{25}=5.\n\nHow to get y_{25}=5.\n\nFrom T=22: D to y=4 at T=23\n\nT=23: S to y=4 at T=24? Or other.\n\nAt T=23: if I go S, y_{24}=4\n\nThen T=24: U to y_25=5\n\nSo y_25=5 at T=25.\n\nThen at T=25: U to y_26=6\n\nThen at T=26: U to y_27=7\n\nSo y=7 at T=27.\n\nCannot be earlier.\n\nIf at T=23 I go D to y=3 at T=24, then T=24: U to y=4 at T=25, later.\n\nSo y=7 at T=27 is earliest.\n\nTherefore, I cannot reach y=8 before T=28, and at T=28,29,30 occupied, so I have to go to y=8 at T=31 or later.\n\nThus, the minimal H is 10, with the path I have.\n\nBut let's confirm if I can save a turn.\n\nAnother possibility: since y=1 is always safe, I could go down and up, but it takes more turns.\n\nFor example, at T=22: D to y=4\n\nT=23: D to y=3\n\nT=24: D to y=2\n\nT=25: D to y=1\n\nThen T=25: at y=1, U to y=2 at T=26\n\nT=26: U to y=3 at T=27\n\nT=27: U to y=4 at T=28\n\nT=28: U to y=5 at T=29, but T=29 y=5 occupied, collision.\n\nNot good.\n\nI could wait at y=1, but worse.\n\nSo not better.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 10.\n\nNow, for the sequence, at T=27, I can stay multiple turns, but in the sequence, I need to specify actions.\n\nIn the path:\n\nActions:\n\nTurn t_1 =22: action a_{22} = D\n\nThen at turn 23: position y=4, action a_{23} = S (stay)\n\nTurn 24: y=4, action a_{24} = U\n\nTurn 25: y=5, action a_{25} = U\n\nTurn 26: y=6, action a_{26} = U\n\nTurn 27: y=7, action a_{27} = S (to stay for T=28)\n\nTurn 28: y=7, action a_{28} = S (stay for T=29)\n\nTurn 29: y=7, action a_{29} = S (stay for T=30)\n\nTurn 30: y=7, action a_{30} = U (to y=8 at T=31)\n\nTurn 31: y=8, action a_{31} = U (to y=9 at T=32)\n\nAfter a_{31}, at T=32, y=9.\n\nH=10 actions, from t=22 to t=31.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =22 + H -1 =31, so H=10.\n\nThe sequence should be actions for t=22 to t=31.\n\nIn the answer, it should be listed.\n\nBut at turn 29, I stayed, but I could go up later, but I have to wait.\n\nSince y=7 is safe, and I need to avoid T=28,29,30 for y=8, but I can be on y=7.\n\nIs there a way to reach y=9 with fewer than 10 turns?\n\nFor example, if I go to y=8 at T=27.\n\nBut to be at y=8 at T=27, I need y_{27}=8.\n\nWhich means at T=26, y=7 or 8, and action U or S.\n\nBut at T=26, if I am at y=7, go U to y=8 at T=27.\n\nBut to be at y=7 at T=26, as before, not possible before T=27.\n\ny=7 at T=27 earliest.\n\nThus, cannot.\n\nPerhaps start by going down less, but at T=22, I have to go D to avoid collision.\n\nUnless I go to y=7 directly, but from y=5, I need two steps to y=7, but at T=23, if I could be at y=6, but occupied.\n\nNo.\n\nSo I think 10 is minimal.\n\nBut let's list the free times for critical rows.\n\nFreeway 5 and 6: occupied T=23,24,29,30\n\nFreeway 8: occupied T=28,29,30\n\nTo go from y=5 to y=9, passing through y=6,7,8.\n\ny=7 always safe.\n\nI need to be on y=5 when free, i.e., not T=23,24,29,30\n\nSimilarly for y=6.\n\nAnd y=8 not at T=28,29,30.\n\nEarliest I can be on y=5 is T=25, since T=22 I can be but I have to move down, but at T=22 I am on y=5, but for the path, I can be on y=5 at T=25.\n\nSimilarly, y=6 at T=26, etc.\n\nThen y=7 at T=27.\n\nThen y=8 at T=31, since T=27 possible, but I can only reach y=8 at T=27 if I am at y=7 at T=26, not possible.\n\nSo y=8 at T=31.\n\nThen y=9 at T=32.\n\nThus H=10.\n\nNow for the sequence, in the waiting at y=7, I stayed three turns, but I could do fewer if I time differently, but I have to avoid the occupied times.\n\nSince at T=28,29,30, I can be on y=7, which is safe.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=8 at T=27 if possible, but not.\n\nAnother thought: at T=22, I go D to y=4.\n\nThen at T=23, I go D to y=3.\n\nThen at T=24, I go U to y=4 at T=25? T=24 action to y=4 at T=25? At T=24, if I go U from y=3, y_{25}=4.\n\nThen at T=25, y=4, go U to y=5 at T=26.\n\nT=26: y=5, go U to y=6 at T=27.\n\nT=27: y=6, go U to y=7 at T=28.\n\nThen at T=28, y=7, safe.\n\nThen I need to go to y=8, but at T=29, if I go U to y=8, occupied.\n\nSo same, I have to wait until T=31 to go to y=8.\n\nBut now I reached y=7 at T=28, later than before, so worse.\n\nThus, the first path is better with y=7 at T=27.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=10.\n\nNow, for the sequence, I can write the actions.\n\nBut in the sequence, at T=27,28,29 I stayed, but I could combine or something, but actions are per turn.\n\nThe answer format should list actions for each turn starting from t_1.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 22: D\n\nTurn 23: S  (stay, since at y=4)\n\nIn the action, S means stay, so y same.\n\nThen Turn 24: U\n\nTurn 25: U\n\nTurn 26: U\n\nTurn 27: S  (stay at y=7 for next turn)\n\nTurn 28: S\n\nTurn 29: S\n\nTurn 30: U\n\nTurn 31: U\n\nAfter Turn 31 action U, at turn 32, y=9.\n\nThe sequence is actions from t=22 to t=31.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let's write it.\n\nAlso, for freeway 5 and 6, at T=29,30 occupied, but in this path, at T=29 and 30, I am at y=7, not on them, so fine.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nI think this is correct.\n</think>\nTo reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 5) at turn \\(t_1 = 22\\) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the following sequence of actions is determined to be optimal, requiring \\(H = 10\\) turns.

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 23, and the player is at (0,4). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns H, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to 8.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S). The vertical position y is in [0,9]. We start at y=4 and want to get to y=9, so we need to move up 5 units. However, we can also move down or stay to avoid cars.\n\nImportant note: Collision occurs at turn T only if the player is on a freeway y (from 1 to 8) and at that turn T, the car (on that freeway) has a span that includes 0 (the x-coordinate of the player). Also note that when moving, the player is only on the freeway of the current y at the beginning of the turn. When we move at turn T, we are at y_T at the start of the turn, and then we move to y_{T+1} at the end of the turn. Therefore, at turn T, we are only on freeway y_T, and we only check the cars on that freeway for collision at that turn.\n\nMoreover, the car movement: \n- For a right-moving car: at time t, span [τ, h] (with τ <= h) becomes at time T: [τ + s*(T-t), h + s*(T-t)]\n- For a left-moving car: [h, τ] (with h<=τ) becomes [h - s*(T-t), τ - s*(T-t)]\n\nBut note: all cars in this problem are right-moving (since direction is \"right\" for all). So we use the right-moving formula.\n\nWe are given the state at turn t1=23. For each car on each freeway, we have one or more cars (like freeway 5 and 6 have three cars each).\n\nWe need to compute for each future turn T (>=23) and for each freeway (if the player is on that freeway at turn T) whether there is a car on that freeway such that 0 is in the car's span at that turn.\n\nThe plan: we are to find the minimal H and a sequence of actions (U, D, S) such that starting from y_23=4, after H turns, we are at y_{23+H-1}=9.\n\nWe can model this as a state space: (time, y) where time = current turn (starting at 23) and y in [0,9]. We want to go from (23,4) to some (T,9) with minimal T-23+1? Actually, H is the number of turns. So if we start at turn 23 and take H turns, then the last action is at turn 23+H-1 and we end at y_{23+H}=9. But note: the problem says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning t=0 to H-1, so the actions are at t1, t1+1, ... t1+H-1. Then the position after H turns is at turn t1+H. We require that at turn t1+H-1 (the last action) we end at (0,9). Actually, the problem says: \"reach (0,9)\" at the turn after the last action? Let me read:\n\n\"minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions ... to reach (0,9)\"\n\nBut note: the player update: at turn t, we are at y_t, then we choose a_t, and then we get y_{t+1}. So after H actions (from t1 to t1+H-1), we will have H new positions: from y_{t1+1} to y_{t1+H}. We require that at the end of the H-th action, we are at (0,9), i.e., at turn t1+H, we are at (0,9). However, the problem says: \"a sequence of actions ... to reach (0,9)\" meaning that the last action should bring us to (0,9). So the last action is at turn t1+H-1 and we end at turn t1+H at (0,9). But note: we are required to output the actions at turns t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nTherefore, we are to find the minimal H such that starting at (23,4), we can get to (23+H, 9) without any collision in the turns from 23 to 23+H-1 (because at each turn t (from 23 to 23+H-1), we are at y_t and we check the car on freeway y_t at that turn t).\n\nBut note: at the starting turn t1=23, we are at (0,4). We will take an action at turn 23 to move to y_{24}. But at turn 23, we are on freeway 4 (if we are at y=4) and we must check if there is a collision at turn 23 on freeway 4.\n\nSimilarly, at each subsequent turn until the turn we are at (0,9) we must avoid collisions. However, note that when we are at y=0 or y=9, there are no cars (since cars are on freeways 1 to 8). So we don't need to check for collisions at y=0 or y=9.\n\nTherefore, we only need to check collisions when we are at y in {1,2,...,8} at a given turn.\n\nOur goal: minimize H, the number of actions (turns) taken.\n\nWe can do a BFS or Dijkstra (since the cost per step is 1) over states (t, y) where t is the turn number and y is the vertical position. The time t starts at 23 and we go forward. The state (t,y) must be collision-free: meaning that if y is between 1 and 8, then we check: at turn t, on freeway y, is there any car that has a span that includes 0? If not, then state (t,y) is safe.\n\nNote: we start at (23,4). We are going to simulate from t=23 onward. We can move to (t+1, y') where y' = y + delta, and delta in {-1,0,1} (if it stays in [0,9]).\n\nHowever, the state space in time might be large because time increases without bound? But note that we are going to 9, and we can only move at most 1 per turn, so the minimal H is at least 5 (because 4 to 9 is 5 steps up). But we might have to wait (by staying or moving down) to avoid cars, so H might be more than 5.\n\nBut note: the cars are moving at constant speeds and we can compute their positions at any future turn T relative to t1=23.\n\nLet me denote T = t (the current turn). The time elapsed from t1=23 to T is dT = T - 23.\n\nFor a car given at t1=23 with parameters (h, τ, d, s), at turn T, the head and tail for a right-moving car become:\n  head_T = h + s * dT\n  tail_T = τ + s * dT\n\nBut note: the car is defined by (head, tail) at time t1. For right-moving, the car spans from τ to h (with τ <= h) at time t1. Then at time T, it spans from [τ + s*dT, h + s*dT].\n\nWe need to check if 0 is in [τ + s*dT, h + s*dT] at turn T.\n\nBut note: the problem says: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T\". So we must check every car on the freeway y_T at turn T.\n\nNow, let's list the cars per freeway at t1=23:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (72,49,right,24) -> at time T: [49+24*(T-23), 72+24*(T-23)]\nFreeway 2: one car: (60,25,right,36) -> [25+36*(T-23), 60+36*(T-23)]\nFreeway 3: same as 2: (60,25,right,36) -> same as above\nFreeway 4: same as 2: (60,25,right,36) -> same as above\nFreeway 5: three cars: \n   car1: (0,-11,right,6) -> [-11+6*(T-23), 0+6*(T-23)]\n   car2: (-36,-47,right,6) -> [-47+6*(T-23), -36+6*(T-23)]\n   car3: (42,31,right,6) -> [31+6*(T-23), 42+6*(T-23)]\nFreeway 6: same as 5: three cars with the same parameters.\nFreeway 7: (60,49,right,12) -> [49+12*(T-23), 60+12*(T-23)]\nFreeway 8: (-20,-31,right,4) -> [-31+4*(T-23), -20+4*(T-23)]\n\nWe need to check for a given freeway k and turn T, if 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway.\n\nNote: for a freeway with multiple cars, we have to check each car.\n\nWe can precompute for each freeway k and for each turn T (starting from 23) whether freeway k is occupied at 0 at turn T.\n\nBut note: T can be large? However, we are going to simulate until we reach y=9. The minimal H is at least 5, but we might need to wait. However, the cars move at fixed speeds and eventually the pattern might repeat? But the speeds are different so the relative positions change. However, we can compute for T from 23 to 23+ (some upper bound). What is the maximum H we might need? \n\nSince we can always wait by going to y=0 and then come back? But that would take more steps. Since we are minimizing H, we are looking for the shortest path. The maximum H we might consider: we know that we must go up 5 steps, but we might have to avoid cars by waiting. The minimal path is at most 5 + (some detour). But we can also move down to avoid and then come back, but that would add steps. \n\nWe can set an upper bound for H: for example, 50? But we can compute the car positions and see when the freeways are safe.\n\nAlternatively, we can use BFS in the state (t, y) and we break when we reach y=9. We let t start at 23 and go upward. Since we are only moving 1 step per turn, the state space is manageable: for each t, y in [0,9]. We can set a maximum t, say up to 23+20 (so 20 steps) because we expect H to be around 5 to 15.\n\nBut note: the cars move at high speeds and the positions are large, so we need to check the interval condition.\n\nLet me write a helper function: for a freeway k and turn T, check if 0 is in any car's span.\n\nWe'll compute for each freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: [49+24*dT, 72+24*dT] \n  Condition: 49+24*dT <= 0 <= 72+24*dT\n  => 24*dT <= -49 -> dT <= -49/24 -> negative, so for dT>=0, the left end is at least 49, so 0 is never in the interval? \n  Actually, at dT=0: [49,72] -> 0 is not in [49,72]. As dT increases, the interval moves to the right. So freeway 1 is always safe? \n\nBut let me check: the car at freeway1: head=72, tail=49 at T=23. Since the car is moving right, and the head is at 72, which is positive, and the tail is at 49, so 0 is not in [49,72] and as time goes by, the entire car moves to the right. So freeway1 is always safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway2: [25+36*dT, 60+36*dT] -> at dT=0: [25,60] -> 0 not in. And then moves right. So always safe.\n\nSame for freeway3 and 4: same as freeway2 -> always safe.\n\nFreeway5: \n  car1: [-11+6*dT, 0+6*dT] -> we need 0 in this interval: \n      -11+6*dT <= 0 <= 0+6*dT\n      => 0 <= 6*dT and 6*dT >= 0 (always true for dT>=0) and -11+6*dT <=0 -> 6*dT <=11 -> dT<=11/6≈1.83 -> so for dT=0,1: \n          dT=0: [-11,0] -> 0 is included? yes, because the interval is [-11,0] and 0 is at the end. \n          dT=1: [-11+6= -5, 0+6=6] -> [-5,6] -> 0 is in.\n          dT=2: [-11+12=1, 0+12=12] -> [1,12] -> 0 not in.\n\n  car2: [-47+6*dT, -36+6*dT] -> at dT=0: [-47,-36] -> 0 not in. dT=1: [-41,-30] -> 0 not in. dT=2: [-35,-24] -> 0 not in. ... until when? \n      Condition: -47+6*dT <=0<=-36+6*dT -> \n        0<=-36+6*dT -> 6*dT>=36 -> dT>=6\n        and -47+6*dT<=0 -> 6*dT<=47 -> dT<=47/6≈7.83\n      So for dT=6,7: \n          dT=6: [-47+36=-11, -36+36=0] -> [-11,0] -> 0 is at the end -> included.\n          dT=7: [-47+42=-5, -36+42=6] -> [-5,6] -> 0 in.\n\n  car3: [31+6*dT, 42+6*dT] -> at dT=0: [31,42] -> 0 not in. And as dT increases, moves right -> always positive and above 0? So never contains 0.\n\nSo freeway5 is unsafe for:\n  car1: dT=0,1 -> T=23,24\n  car2: dT=6,7 -> T=23+6=29, 23+7=30\n\nSimilarly, freeway6: same as freeway5 -> unsafe at T=23,24,29,30.\n\nFreeway7: [49+12*dT, 60+12*dT] -> at dT=0: [49,60] -> safe. Then moves right -> always safe.\n\nFreeway8: [-31+4*dT, -20+4*dT] -> condition: -31+4*dT<=0<=-20+4*dT\n  0<=-20+4*dT -> 4*dT>=20 -> dT>=5\n  -31+4*dT<=0 -> 4*dT<=31 -> dT<=31/4=7.75\n  So for dT=5,6,7: \n      dT=5: [-31+20=-11, -20+20=0] -> [-11,0] -> 0 at the end -> unsafe.\n      dT=6: [-31+24=-7, -20+24=4] -> [-7,4] -> 0 in.\n      dT=7: [-31+28=-3, -20+28=8] -> [-3,8] -> 0 in.\n      dT=8: [-31+32=1, -20+32=12] -> [1,12] -> safe.\n\nSo freeway8 unsafe at dT=5,6,7 -> T=23+5=28, 29, 30.\n\nSummary of unsafe (freeway, turn) pairs:\n\nFreeway 5: T=23,24,29,30\nFreeway 6: same as 5: T=23,24,29,30\nFreeway 8: T=28,29,30\n\nNote: freeway1,2,3,4,7 are always safe.\n\nBut note: at a given turn T, we are only concerned with the freeway we are on. So if we are at freeway5 at T=23, then we are unsafe. Similarly, if we are at freeway5 at T=24, unsafe. Same for freeway6. For freeway8: unsafe at T=28,29,30.\n\nNow, we start at T0=23, y=4. We are at freeway4? But freeway4 is safe (always). So at T=23, we are safe.\n\nOur goal: get to y=9. We can only move one step per turn (or stay, or move down). We must avoid being on freeway5 or freeway6 at T=23,24,29,30 and freeway8 at T=28,29,30.\n\nWe are at y=4 at T=23. We can choose actions: U, D, S.\n\nWe want to get to y=9 as fast as possible.\n\nMinimal steps: 5 (if we go up every turn: U,U,U,U,U). But we have to avoid the unsafe freeways at the unsafe times.\n\nLet's simulate the minimal path: \n  Start: T=23, y=4 (safe, since freeway4 is safe)\n\nOption 1: Go straight up:\n\n  T=23: y=4 -> safe (freeway4 safe). Action U -> y=5 at T=24.\n  T=24: y=5 -> freeway5. But T=24: freeway5 is unsafe! -> collision.\n\nSo we cannot go to freeway5 at T=24.\n\nWe must avoid being at freeway5 at T=24. How?\n\nWe can at T=23: instead of U, we do S (stay) or D (down). \n\nIf we do S at T=23: then at T=24, we are still at y=4 (freeway4, safe). Then at T=24, we can do U to go to y=5 at T=25. But note: at T=25, freeway5: we check if T=25 is unsafe? \n  Freeway5: unsafe at T=23,24,29,30 -> T=25 is safe. \n  So then we can go to y=5 at T=25 (safe). Then we can continue up.\n\nBut wait: what about the next steps? We need to go from y=5 to y=9: 4 more steps. So if we start:\n\n  T=23: S -> y=4 -> safe (freeway4)\n  T=24: U -> y=5 at T=25 (freeway5 at T=25: safe) \n  T=25: U -> y=6 at T=26 (freeway6: at T=26, freeway6 is unsafe only at 23,24,29,30 -> safe)\n  T=26: U -> y=7 at T=27 (freeway7: always safe)\n  T=27: U -> y=8 at T=28 (freeway8: at T=28, freeway8 is unsafe! because T=28 is in {28,29,30})\n  -> collision at T=28.\n\nSo we cannot be at freeway8 at T=28.\n\nHow to avoid? We can at T=27: instead of going to y=8, we stay at y=7? Then at T=27: we are at y=7 (safe). Then at T=27 we can choose to go up at T=28? But then at T=28, we go to y=8 -> but then at T=28 we are at freeway8 -> unsafe.\n\nAlternatively, we can at T=27: move down to y=6? Then at T=28 we are at freeway6. But T=28: freeway6 is unsafe only at 23,24,29,30 -> so T=28 is safe? \n  Yes, because unsafe at 23,24,29,30 -> 28 is safe.\n\nBut then we are at y=6 at T=28. Then we have to go back up. \n\nAlternatively, we can wait at y=7 until T=31? because at T=31, freeway8 is safe (since unsafe only at 28,29,30). Then we can go from y=7 to y=8 at T=31 (safe) and then to y=9 at T=32.\n\nBut that would take more steps.\n\nLet's compute the entire sequence:\n\nOption: \n  T=23: S -> y=4 (safe)\n  T=24: U -> y=5 at T=25 (safe)\n  T=25: U -> y=6 at T=26 (safe)\n  T=26: U -> y=7 at T=27 (safe)\n  T=27: we cannot go to y=8 at T=28 (unsafe). So we stay at y=7: S -> then at T=28, we are at y=7 (freeway7: safe) \n  T=28: we cannot go to y=8 because at T=28, freeway8 is unsafe. So we must wait at y=7 again? \n        But if we stay again at T=28: then at T=29 we are at y=7 (safe). Then at T=29: we can go to y=8? \n        But at T=29, freeway8 is unsafe. So we cannot go to y=8 at T=29? \n        Actually, when we go from T=29 (at y=7) to y=8, then at turn T=29 we are at freeway7 (safe) and then at the next state we are at y=8 at T=30. But at T=30, we are at freeway8 -> which is unsafe (because T=30 is unsafe for freeway8). \n\nSo we have to avoid freeway8 at T=28,29,30. So we must wait until T=31 to be at freeway8.\n\nSo:\n  T=27: S -> y=7 at T=28 (safe at freeway7)\n  T=28: S -> y=7 at T=29 (safe)\n  T=29: S -> y=7 at T=30 (safe)\n  T=30: U -> y=8 at T=31 (freeway8 at T=31: safe? because unsafe only at 28,29,30 -> safe at 31)\n  T=31: U -> y=9 at T=32 -> we are at y=9 (goal) and no collision at T=31? but at T=31 we are at freeway8? \n        Actually, at T=31: we start at y=8 (freeway8) and then we do U to go to y=9. But at the beginning of turn T=31, we are at y=8 -> so we check freeway8 at T=31: safe. Then we move to y=9 at T=32. At T=32, we are at y=9 -> no freeway to check.\n\nSo the sequence from T=23 to T=31 (actions at T=23 to T=31) -> 9 actions? But we started at T=23 at y=4, and we ended at T=32 at y=9.\n\nBut let's count the turns we took actions: T=23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31 -> 9 actions.\n\nBut we can do better? \n\nAlternative: avoid freeway8 at T=28,29,30 by being at y=8 at a safe time? But the unsafe times for y=8 are fixed: T=28,29,30. So we must not be on y=8 at those turns.\n\nBut note: we can be at y=8 at T=27? But we get to y=8 at T=28 by moving at T=27. How about getting to y=8 earlier? \n\nWe started at T=23 at y=4. The minimal time to get to y=8 is 4 steps: U,U,U,U -> then at T=27 we would be at y=8. But at T=27: we are at freeway8? \n  We get to y=8 at T=27? How? \n  T=23: U -> y=5 at T=24 -> unsafe? because freeway5 at T=24 is unsafe. So we cannot take that first step.\n\nWe had to wait at T=23 (S) to avoid freeway5 at T=24. Then we went to y=5 at T=25. Then we can go up: \n  T=25: U -> y=6 at T=26\n  T=26: U -> y=7 at T=27\n  T=27: U -> y=8 at T=28 -> unsafe.\n\nSo we cannot get to y=8 before T=28? \n\nAlternatively, we can go faster? We can only move one step per turn.\n\nAnother alternative: go up to y=9 without going to y=8? But we have to pass through y=8. \n\nUnless we jump? No, we can only change by -1,0,1.\n\nSo we have to pass through y=8.\n\nBut we can be at y=8 at T=27? Only if we started at y=4 and did 4 ups: but the first up at T=23 would lead to y=5 at T=24 -> unsafe. So we cannot.\n\nWe can be at y=8 at T=31 (by waiting at y=7 until T=30, then moving to y=8 at T=31). Then we move to y=9 at T=32.\n\nBut that is 9 actions: \n  actions: S (at T=23), U (24), U (25), U (26), S (27), S (28), S (29), U (30), U (31)\n\nBut we can do better: \n\nWhat if we avoid the freeway5 at T=24 by moving down? \n\nAt T=23: we are at y=4. We can move down to y=3? Then at T=24, we are at freeway3? freeway3 is always safe. Then we can go up from there.\n\nBut then we have to go from y=3 to y=9: 6 steps. And we have to avoid the unsafe freeways.\n\nBut note: freeway3 is safe. Then at T=24: we are at y=3. Then we can go up to y=4 at T=25 (freeway4 safe), then to y=5 at T=26 (freeway5: T=26 is safe because unsafe only at 23,24,29,30). Then to y=6 at T=27 (freeway6: T=27 safe). Then to y=7 at T=28 (freeway7 safe). Then we want to go to y=8 at T=29: but freeway8 at T=29 is unsafe. So we have to wait at y=7 until T=31? \n\nSo sequence:\n  T=23: D -> y=3 at T=24 (freeway3: safe)\n  T=24: U -> y=4 at T=25 (freeway4: safe)\n  T=25: U -> y=5 at T=26 (freeway5: safe? T=26 not in {23,24,29,30} -> safe)\n  T=26: U -> y=6 at T=27 (freeway6: safe)\n  T=27: U -> y=7 at T=28 (freeway7: safe)\n  Then we have to wait at y=7 for 3 turns? until T=31? because freeway8 is unsafe at T=28,29,30.\n  So:\n  T=28: S -> y=7 at T=29 (safe)\n  T=29: S -> y=7 at T=30 (safe)\n  T=30: U -> y=8 at T=31 (freeway8: safe)\n  T=31: U -> y=9 at T=32\n\nTotal actions: 9.\n\nSame as before.\n\nBut can we avoid waiting 3 times at y=7? \n\nWe can try to be at y=8 at a safe time, but the next safe time for freeway8 is T=31. \n\nAlternatively, we can be at y=9 at T=28? That would be 5 steps: from y=4 to y=9 in 5 steps. But we have to avoid freeway5 at T=24 and freeway8 at T=28. \n\nTo be at y=9 at T=28: \n  We start at T=23: y=4. \n  Then:\n    T=23: action -> to y_24\n    T=24: to y_25\n    T=25: to y_26\n    T=26: to y_27\n    T=27: to y_28 = 9.\n\nSo we need to go from 4 to 9 in 4 moves? That requires 5 steps? Actually, 4 actions: \n  y_24 = 5, y_25=6, y_26=7, y_27=8, y_28=9.\n\nBut then we have:\n  T=23: we are at y=4 -> safe. We do U: then y_24=5 -> but at T=24, we are at freeway5 -> unsafe.\n\nSo we cannot.\n\nAlternatively, if we go faster? We can only move one step per turn.\n\nAnother idea: use a detour to avoid freeway5 at T=24 by being at a different freeway at T=24. But we start at y=4 at T=23. We can only go to y=3,4,5 at T=24. \n  y=3: freeway3 (safe)\n  y=4: freeway4 (safe)\n  y=5: freeway5 (unsafe)\n\nSo we can go to y=3 or y=4 at T=24.\n\nIf we go to y=4 (by staying) then we avoid the unsafe freeway5 at T=24. Then we can proceed.\n\nBut then we have to avoid freeway8 at T=28. How? We are at:\n  T=23: S -> y=4 at T=24 (safe)\n  T=24: U -> y=5 at T=25 (freeway5: T=25 safe)\n  T=25: U -> y=6 at T=26 (safe)\n  T=26: U -> y=7 at T=27 (safe)\n  T=27: we want to go to y=8 at T=28? but unsafe. \n        or to y=9 at T=28? but we can only move one step: so we go to y=8 at T=28 -> unsafe.\n\nSo we have to wait at y=7 until T=30? Then at T=30 we go to y=8 at T=31? But then we are at freeway8 at T=31: safe. Then at T=31 we go to y=9.\n\nBut that is 8 actions? \n  T=23: S\n  T=24: U\n  T=25: U\n  T=26: U\n  T=27: S   [wait at y=7 for T=28? but we don't want to be at y=8 at T=28, so we stay at y=7 at T=28?]\n        Actually, at T=27: we are at y=7. We do S: then at T=28 we are at y=7 (safe). \n        Then at T=28: we are at y=7. We can do S again to stay at y=7 at T=29 (safe)\n        Then at T=29: S -> y=7 at T=30 (safe)\n        Then at T=30: U -> y=8 at T=31 (safe)\n        Then at T=31: U -> y=9 at T=32\n\nThat's 8 actions? But we have 8 actions: at T=23,24,...,30 -> 8 actions, then we end at T=32.\n\nBut wait, we have to do 8 actions: \n  T=23: S\n  T=24: U\n  T=25: U\n  T=26: U\n  T=27: S\n  T=28: S\n  T=29: S\n  T=30: U\n  T=31: U   -> but wait, we haven't done T=31 action? \n\nActually, the actions are taken at turns: T=23,24,...,30: that's 8 actions. Then we are at T=31 at y=8? No:\n\n  Start: T=23, y=4.\n  T=23: S -> then at T=24: y=4? No: \n      The update: at turn t, we do a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + delta.\n\n  So:\n      T=23: S -> y_{24} = 4 + 0 = 4.\n      T=24: U -> y_{25} = 4+1 = 5.\n      T=25: U -> y_{26} = 5+1 = 6.\n      T=26: U -> y_{27} = 6+1 = 7.\n      T=27: S -> y_{28} = 7+0 = 7.\n      T=28: S -> y_{29} = 7.\n      T=29: S -> y_{30} = 7.\n      T=30: U -> y_{31} = 8.\n      T=31: we need to do an action to get to y=9. So we must do U at T=31 -> y_{32}=9.\n\nSo we need 9 actions: T=23 to T=31.\n\nBut we can combine the waiting? \n\nWhat if we at T=27: instead of staying, we go down to y=6? Then at T=28 we are at freeway6. But freeway6 at T=28: unsafe? \n  Freeway6 unsafe at T=29,30? No, unsafe at T=23,24,29,30 -> so T=28 is safe.\n\nThen at T=28: we can go up to y=7? Then at T=29 we are at freeway7 (safe). Then at T=29: we are at y=7. Then we can go to y=8 at T=30? but freeway8 at T=30 is unsafe.\n\nAlternatively, at T=28: we are at y=6 (freeway6: safe at T=28). Then we can go to y=5? Then we are at freeway5 at T=29: unsafe (because freeway5 unsafe at T=29) -> not safe.\n\nOr we can stay at y=6 at T=28: then T=29: freeway6 at T=29: unsafe! because T=29 is unsafe for freeway6.\n\nSo that doesn't work.\n\nAnother idea: at T=27, go up to y=8? -> unsafe at T=28.\n\nOr at T=27, go down to y=6, then at T=28 go down to y=5? Then at T=28: freeway6 -> safe? but then at T=29: we are at freeway5? and T=29 is unsafe for freeway5.\n\nSo we cannot.\n\nTherefore, the only option is to wait at y=7 until T=30, then at T=30 go to y=8 (safe at T=31? no, at T=30 we are at freeway8? wait: \n\nAt T=30: we do U at turn T=30: then we move to y=8 at T=31. But at turn T=30, we are at y=7 (freeway7) -> safe. Then we move to y=8 at T=31. At T=31, we start at y=8 (freeway8) and we do U to go to y=9. But we must check at T=31: freeway8 at T=31: safe? yes. \n\nSo the sequence:\n\n  T=23: S -> y24=4\n  T=24: U -> y25=5\n  T=25: U -> y26=6\n  T=26: U -> y27=7\n  T=27: S -> y28=7   (wait)\n  T=28: S -> y29=7   (wait)\n  T=29: S -> y30=7   (wait)\n  T=30: U -> y31=8\n  T=31: U -> y32=9\n\nThat's 9 actions.\n\nBut we can start with a down at T=23? \n\n  T=23: D -> y24=3\n  T=24: U -> y25=4\n  T=25: U -> y26=5\n  T=26: U -> y27=6\n  T=27: U -> y28=7\n  Then we have to wait at y=7 for T=28, T=29, T=30: \n      T=28: S -> y29=7\n      T=29: S -> y30=7\n      T=30: U -> y31=8\n      T=31: U -> y32=9\n\nAlso 9 actions.\n\nBut note: we can be at y=8 at T=31 and then at T=31 we go to y=9. But we are at y=8 at T=31: that is safe. \n\nIs there a way to be at y=9 earlier? \n\nWe can try to be at y=9 at T=31: \n  Then we must be at y=8 at T=30? because we do U at T=30 to get y31=9. \n  But to be at y=8 at T=30: we must have been at y=7 at T=29? and done U at T=29 to get y30=8. \n  Then we do U at T=30 to get y31=9.\n\nBut at T=30, we are at freeway8: unsafe. So we cannot be at y=8 at T=30.\n\nAlternatively, we can be at y=8 at T=31: then we do U at T=31 to get y32=9. \n\nBut we want to be at y=9 at the end of the actions. The problem says: the last action is at turn t1+H-1 and we end at turn t1+H at (0,9). So that's acceptable.\n\nBut we want minimal H. \n\nIs there a sequence that takes 8 actions? \n\nWe start at T=23, and do 8 actions: from T=23 to T=30. Then we end at T=31 at some y. We want y=9 at T=31? \n\nBut to be at y=9 at T=31, we must have been at y=8 at T=30 and done U at T=30. But at T=30, freeway8 is unsafe -> collision.\n\nWe could be at y=9 at T=31 without passing through y=8 at T=30? Only if we were at y=9 at T=30 and did S? But we want to end at T=31 at y=9. \n\nActually, if we are at y=9 at T=30, then we can do S at T=30 and be at y=9 at T=31. But then we are at y=9 at T=31, which is the goal. But we don't need to be at y=9 at the last action? The goal is to be at (0,9) at the end of the last action, i.e., at turn t1+H. \n\nSo if we are at y=9 at T=30, then we are done? But wait, the last action would be at T=30? and we are at y=9 at T=31? \n\nActually, no: if we do an action at T=30, then we are at y_{31}. If we do S at T=30 and we were at y_{30}=9, then y_{31}=9. \n\nSo we can be at y=9 at T=31 by being at y=9 at T=30 and then doing S at T=30.\n\nBut how to be at y=9 at T=30? \n\nWe start at T=23, y=4. We need to be at y=9 at T=30: that is 7 moves: from 4 to 9: 5 steps up, so we need at least 5 actions of U, and we can have 2 waits. \n\nBut we have to avoid the unsafe freeways.\n\nLet me try:\n\n  T=23: S (wait) -> y24=4\n  T=24: U -> y25=5\n  T=25: U -> y26=6\n  T=26: U -> y27=7\n  T=27: U -> y28=8 -> but at T=27 we are at freeway7 (safe), then we move to y=8 at T=28 -> which is unsafe (freeway8 at T=28). \n\nAlternatively, at T=27: stay -> y28=7\n  T=28: U -> y29=8 -> unsafe (freeway8 at T=29) -> no.\n\nOr at T=27: go down to y=6? Then at T=28: we are at freeway6 -> unsafe? T=28 for freeway6: unsafe only at 23,24,29,30 -> safe. \n  Then T=28: U -> y29=7 (freeway7 safe)\n  T=29: U -> y30=8 -> unsafe (freeway8 at T=30) -> no.\n\nOr at T=28: we are at y=6 (from T=27: D -> y28=6). Then T=28: U -> y29=7 (safe)\n  T=29: U -> y30=8 (unsafe at T=30? but at T=29 we are at freeway7 (safe), and then we move to y=8 at T=30. At T=30, we are at freeway8 -> unsafe.\n\nSo we cannot be at y=8 at T=30.\n\nTo be at y=9 at T=30: we must be at y=8 at T=29 and do U at T=29. But at T=29, freeway8 is unsafe -> collision at T=29.\n\nTherefore, we cannot be at y=9 at T=30. \n\nThe earliest we can be at y=9 is T=32, by being at y=8 at T=31 (safe) and then U at T=31.\n\nAnd to be at y=8 at T=31, we must be at y=7 at T=30 and do U at T=30. \n\nSo the minimal sequence must go through y=7 at T=30 and then to y=8 at T=31 and then to y=9 at T=32.\n\nAnd to get to y=7 at T=30, we can do it in various ways, but the fastest is to be at y=7 by T=27 or earlier and then wait until T=30.\n\nThe fastest to get to y=7: \n  Start: T=23, y=4.\n  We can: \n      T=23: S -> T=24: y=4\n      T=24: U -> T=25: y=5\n      T=25: U -> T=26: y=6\n      T=26: U -> T=27: y=7\n\nSo we are at y=7 at T=27. Then we wait at y=7 for turns T=27, T=28, T=29: so three stays. Then at T=30: U to y=8 (at T=31) and then at T=31: U to y=9.\n\nTotal actions: 8 (from T=23 to T=30) plus one more at T=31? \n\nActually, the actions are at T=23,24,...,31: that's 9 actions.\n\nBut we can try to get to y=7 faster? \n\nIf we do U at T=23: then y24=5 -> unsafe (freeway5 at T=24). So we cannot.\n\nAlternatively, we can go down and then up? \n\n  T=23: D -> y24=3\n  T=24: U -> y25=4\n  T=25: U -> y26=5\n  T=26: U -> y27=6\n  T=27: U -> y28=7\n\nThen we are at y=7 at T=28. Then we only need to wait two more turns? until T=30: \n  T=28: S -> y29=7\n  T=29: S -> y30=7\n  T=30: U -> y31=8\n  T=31: U -> y32=9\n\nThat's 8 actions? Let's count: \n  T=23: D\n  T=24: U\n  T=25: U\n  T=26: U\n  T=27: U  -> now at T=28: y=7\n  T=28: S\n  T=29: S\n  T=30: U\n  T=31: U\n\nThat's 9 actions again.\n\nBut note: we have the same number.\n\nHowever, observe that in the first sequence (with initial S) we used 9 actions and in this one also 9.\n\nBut we have an alternative that might save one action? \n\nWhat if we go up to y=8 at a safe turn? The next safe turn for freeway8 after T=27 is T=31. So we must be at y=8 at T=31. \n\nThe minimal time to get to y=8 is 4 steps (if no waiting), but we have to wait at the beginning to avoid freeway5 at T=24, and then we have to wait at the end for freeway8 to be safe. \n\nThe earliest we can be at y=7 is T=27 (if we do: T=23: S, T=24: U, T=25: U, T=26: U -> y27=7). Then we wait at y=7 for 3 turns (T=27,28,29) -> then at T=30: U to y=8 (at T=31) -> and then T=31: U to y=9.\n\nTotal turns from start to finish: from T=23 to T=32 -> 10 turns? but we only care about the number of actions.\n\nThe actions are taken at turns: T=23 to T=31 -> 9 actions.\n\nIs there a way to be at y=7 earlier? Only if we don't wait at T=23. But we have to wait at T=23 to avoid freeway5 at T=24. \n\nUnless we move down at T=23: then we can do U at T=24 to get to y=4, then U at T=25 to y=5, etc. But that also takes the same time.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 9.\n\nNow, we need to output the sequence of actions.\n\nWe have two valid sequences:\n\nSequence 1 (start with S):\n  T=23: S\n  T=24: U\n  T=25: U\n  T=26: U\n  T=27: S\n  T=28: S\n  T=29: S\n  T=30: U\n  T=31: U\n\nSequence 2 (start with D):\n  T=23: D\n  T=24: U\n  T=25: U\n  T=26: U\n  T=27: U\n  T=28: S\n  T=29: S\n  T=30: U\n  T=31: U\n\nBoth are 9 actions.\n\nBut note: in sequence 2, at T=27: we do U to go from y=6 to y=7 at T=28. Then we wait at T=28 and T=29. \n\nBut in both sequences, we end at T=32 at y=9.\n\nWe can choose either.\n\nLet me verify collision for sequence 1:\n\n  T=23: y=4 -> freeway4: safe.\n  T=24: action S: then we are at y=4 at T=24 -> freeway4: safe.\n  T=25: after action U, we are at y=5 at T=25 -> freeway5: T=25 is safe (not 23,24,29,30) -> safe.\n  T=26: after U, y=6 at T=26 -> freeway6: T=26 safe.\n  T=27: after U, y=7 at T=27 -> freeway7: safe.\n  T=28: action S: then y=7 at T=28 -> freeway7: safe.\n  T=29: action S: y=7 at T=29 -> freeway7: safe.\n  T=30: action U: then y=8 at T=31? Actually, at T=30: we are at y=7 (freeway7 safe) and then we move to y=8 at T=31.\n        But at turn T=30, we are on freeway7 -> safe.\n  T=31: action U: then we move to y=9 at T=32. At turn T=31, we are at y=8 -> freeway8: T=31 is safe (only unsafe at 28,29,30) -> safe.\n\nSo no collision.\n\nSimilarly for sequence 2:\n\n  T=23: D -> then y=3 at T=24: freeway3: safe.\n  T=24: U -> y=4 at T=25: freeway4: safe.\n  T=25: U -> y=5 at T=26: freeway5: T=26 safe.\n  T=26: U -> y=6 at T=27: freeway6: T=27 safe.\n  T=27: U -> y=7 at T=28: freeway7: safe.\n  T=28: S -> y=7 at T=29: freeway7: safe.\n  T=29: S -> y=7 at T=30: freeway7: safe.\n  T=30: U -> y=8 at T=31: freeway8 at T=31: safe.\n  T=31: U -> y=9 at T=32.\n\nAlso safe.\n\nWe can choose sequence 1 to output.\n\nBut is there a sequence with H=8? We couldn't find one. Let me try to see if we can be at y=9 at T=31 with 8 actions.\n\nWe do 8 actions: T=23 to T=30. We require that at T=31, we are at y=9. That means the last action at T=30 must move to y=9. So we must be at y=8 at T=30 and do U at T=30. But then at T=30, we are at freeway8? and T=30 is unsafe for freeway8 -> collision.\n\nAlternatively, we can be at y=9 at T=30 and then do nothing? But we have to do an action at T=30. If we are at y=9 at T=30, we can do S to stay. But how to be at y=9 at T=30? \n\nWe must be at y=8 at T=29 and do U at T=29 to get y30=9. But at T=29, we are at freeway8 -> unsafe.\n\nTherefore, there is no sequence with H=8.\n\nSo minimal H is 9.\n\nWe output the actions for sequence 1:\n\nTurn 23: S\nTurn 24: U\nTurn 25: U\nTurn 26: U\nTurn 27: S\nTurn 28: S\nTurn 29: S\nTurn 30: U\nTurn 31: U\n\nBut wait, the last action is at turn t1+H-1 = 23+9-1 = 31, which matches.\n\nIn the answer format, we list the actions for turns 23 to 31.\n\nSo:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 23: S\nTurn 24: U\nTurn 25: U\nTurn 26: U\nTurn 27: S\nTurn 28: S\nTurn 29: S\nTurn 30: U\nTurn 31: U\n}\n\nBut note: the problem says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\".\n\nHere, t1=23, H=9, so t from 0 to 8: \n  t=0: a_{23} = S\n  t=1: a_{24} = U\n  ...\n  t=8: a_{31} = U\n\nYes.\n\nWe can also choose sequence 2, but sequence 1 is equally minimal and valid.\n\nHowever, in sequence 1, we do three consecutive S at T=27,28,29. And in sequence 2, we do two S at T=28,29. But both are 9 actions.\n\nBut in sequence 2, we did an extra U at T=27. Both are 9 actions.\n\nI think both are acceptable. But we'll go with sequence 1.\n\nFinal answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 4)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 23\\) is 9, considering the need to avoid collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\nThe unsafe conditions for freeways are:\n- Freeway 5: unsafe at turns 23, 24, 29, 30.\n- Freeway 6: unsafe at turns 23, 24, 29, 30.\n- Freeway 8: unsafe at turns 28, 29, 30.\n\nThe sequence of actions avoids these unsafe conditions:\n- At turn 23, staying at \\(y = 4\\) (freeway 4, safe) avoids freeway 5 at turn 24.\n- Moving up to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 25 (freeway 5 safe as turn 25 is not unsafe).\n- Moving up to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 26 (freeway 6 safe as turn 26 is not unsafe).\n- Moving up to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 27 (freeway 7 always safe).\n- Staying at \\(y = 7\\) for turns 27, 28, and 29 to avoid freeway 8 at turns 28, 29, and 30.\n- Moving up to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 31 (freeway 8 safe as turn 31 is not unsafe).\n- Moving up to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 32 (goal reached, no freeway check needed for \\(y = 9\\)).\n\nThe sequence of actions is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 23: S\nTurn 24: U\nTurn 25: U\nTurn 26: U\nTurn 27: S\nTurn 28: S\nTurn 29: S\nTurn 30: U\nTurn 31: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,4) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible without colliding with any cars. The cars are on freeways y=1 to y=8, and I start on y=4. The position is given as (x,y), but since the player only moves vertically, x is always 0 for the player, I think. The cars are on the freeways, which are horizontal, so they move left or right.\n\nThe collision happens if at turn T, when I'm on freeway y_T, there is a car on that freeway such that its span includes x=0 at that turn. Since I'm always at x=0, I think.\n\nThe player is at (0, y_t), so x=0, and y from 0 to 9. Freeways are at y=1 to 8, so when I'm on y=0 or y=9, there are no cars, so no collision possible there. y=0 and y=9 are safe, I assume.\n\nThe goal is to reach (0,9), which is y=9, so once I'm there, I'm safe.\n\nNow, I start at turn t_1 = 24, position (0,4).\n\nI need to go to y=9, so I need to move up. But I have to avoid the cars on the way.\n\nThe cars move with constant speed, and I have their positions at turn t_1=24.\n\nFor each car, given head, tail, direction, speed, I can compute where it is at any future turn.\n\nThe span is given, and for left-moving, head is the right end? Let me read carefully.\n\nIt says: for left-moving car, span(t_1) = [h, τ], and then at T, [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nSince it's moving left, decreasing x.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving, span(t_1) = [τ, h], and at T, [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nIn the car state table, for each freeway, it lists cars with (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nI need to interpret head and tail based on direction.\n\nFor example, on freeway 1: (-48, -71, right, 24)\n\nDirection is right, so it should be [τ, h], meaning tail to head, with head being the front when moving right.\n\nFor right-moving, span is [τ, h] with τ < h, since moving right, increasing x.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, [h, τ] with h > τ, moving left, decreasing x.\n\nIn this case, freeway 1: (-48, -71, right, 24)\n\nDirection right, so span should be [τ, h] = [-71, -48]? But it says (head, tail) = (-48, -71), and direction right.\n\nIf direction is right, head should be the right end, I think.\n\nLet's see the notation: it says \"head h, tail τ\", and for right-moving, \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h]\"\n\nIn the car state, it's given as (head, tail, dir, speed), so for dir right, span is [tail, head], so tail < head.\n\nHere, head = -48, tail = -71, so tail = -71, head = -48, so since dir right, span is [tail, head] = [-71, -48], and since moving right, at time T, span is [ -71 + s(T-t_1), -48 + s(T-t_1) ]\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, if dir left, span is [head, tail] with head > tail, moving left.\n\nBut in the table, all cars seem to be right-moving except I need to check.\n\nLooking at the car states:\n\nFreeway 1: (-48, -71, right, 24) → so right-moving, span at t1: [-71, -48]\n\nSpeed s=24, so at time T, span: [ -71 + 24*(T-24), -48 + 24*(T-24) ]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: (-48, -83, right, 36) → span at t1: [-83, -48], s=36\n\nFreeway 3: same as freeway 2? (-48, -83, right, 36) → identical to freeway 2? Probably different freeway, but same car parameters? Or is it a typo?\n\nFreeway 3 also has (-48, -83, right, 36), same as freeway 2.\n\nBut freeway 2 and 3 are different rows, so different freeways, but same car configuration, I think.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 4: (-48, -83, right, 36) again.\n\nThen freeway 5: (6, -5, right, 6), (-30, -41, right, 6), (48, 37, right, 6) → three cars on freeway 5.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6: same as freeway 5? (6, -5, right, 6), (-30, -41, right, 6), (48, 37, right, 6) → identical.\n\nFreeway 7: (-48, -59, right, 12)\n\nFreeway 8: (-16, -27, right, 4)\n\nAll cars are right-moving, no left-moving.\n\nDirection all \"right\", so all moving to the right.\n\nFor each, since dir right, span at t1 is [tail, head], so head > tail.\n\nIn the tuple, it's (head, tail, dir, speed), and for dir right, head is the right end, tail is left end.\n\nSo for freeway 1: head=-48, tail=-71, so span at t1=24: [ -71, -48 ]\n\ns=24, so at time T, position: [ -71 + 24*(T-24), -48 + 24*(T-24) ]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nCollision if at turn T, when I am on freeway y, and for that freeway, there is a car such that 0 is in its span at T.\n\nThat is, for some car on y, min_span <= 0 <= max_span at time T.\n\nNow, the player moves at each turn: action U, D, S, changing y by +1, -1, 0, staying within 0-9.\n\nImportant note: when I move, at turn T, I am on y_T, and I might move to y_{T+1}, but at turn T, I am only on y_T, so I only check collision for freeway y_T at turn T. If I move to y_{T+1} at turn T, I am not on y_{T+1} until turn T+1, so at turn T, I am still on y_T for collision.\n\nThe note says: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 in span at T but not at T+1.\"\n\nSimilarly, for the current freeway, if I leave it, I don't care about future spans on that freeway.\n\nBut at the turn when I am on it, I need no car covering x=0.\n\nNow, I start at turn 24, y=4.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nSince y=9 is safe, I can go directly up, but I have to avoid cars on y=4,5,6,7,8.\n\ny=1,2,3 are below, but I'm starting from 4, going up, so I don't need to worry about y=1,2,3 unless I go down, but since I want to go up, probably not.\n\nI can only move one step per turn, so minimum turns to go from y=4 to y=9 is 5 turns if I go up each time, but I might need to wait or something to avoid cars.\n\nH is the number of turns, including the starting turn? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence is from t=0 to H-1, for turns t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nDefine: at turn t, I take action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nThe player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, where Δy_t depends on a_t.\n\nSo at turn t, I am at position (0, y_t), and I choose a_t, which sets y_{t+1} for the next turn.\n\nThen at turn t, I am on freeway y_t, and I check for collision on that freeway at time t.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T only if for the freeway y_T, at time T, 0 in span of some car on that freeway.\n\nAt turn T, I am on y_T, so I check freeway y_T at time T.\n\nIf I take action at T to go to y_{T+1}, that doesn't affect my position at T; at T, I am still on y_T.\n\nNow, to reach y=9, I need to be at y=9 at some turn, say T, and since y=9 has no cars, no collision, so I just need y_T = 9 for some T.\n\nBut I need to minimize H, the number of turns from start to when I first reach y=9? Not necessarily first, but since I want minimal H, I should reach as soon as possible.\n\nThe sequence {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, and after H turns, I am at y_{t_1 + H} =9? Let's clarify the indexing.\n\nSet t_1 = 24.\n\nAt turn t_1=24, I am at y_{t_1} = y_{24} =4.\n\nI take action a_{24}, which sets y_{25} = y_{24} + Δy_{24}.\n\nThen at turn 25, I am at y_{25}, take a_{25}, and so on.\n\nAfter some actions, at turn t_1 + H, I am at y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nThe sequence of actions is for turns t_1 to t_1 + H -1, so H actions, and after that, at turn t_1 + H, position is (0,9).\n\nFor example, if I do nothing, H=0, but y=4 ≠9, so H at least 1? Let's see.\n\nAt turn t_1=24, y=4.\n\nAfter H turns, meaning after H actions, I am at turn t_1 + H with y=9.\n\nThe actions are taken from turn t_1 to t_1 + H -1, so H actions.\n\nFor instance, if I could go directly to 9 in one action, but I can only change by +1 or -1, so minimum 5 actions to go from 4 to 9: U,U,U,U,U.\n\nEach U increases y by 1, so from y=4, after k U actions, y=4+k.\n\nSet 4+k=9, k=5, so at least 5 actions.\n\nAfter 5 actions, at turn 24+5=29, y=9.\n\nActions at turns 24,25,26,27,28: all U.\n\nThen at turn 29, y=9.\n\nNow, during these turns, when I am on y=4,5,6,7,8, I need to ensure that at that turn, no car on that freeway covers x=0.\n\nI start at turn 24 on y=4.\n\nAt turn 24, I am on y=4, so I need to check if at turn 24, on freeway 4, is there a car such that 0 in its span?\n\nFreeway 4 has cars? From table, freeway 4: (-48, -83, right, 36)\n\nOnly one car, I think.\n\nFreeway 4: | 4 | (-48, -83, right, 36) | so one car with head=-48, tail=-83, dir right, s=36.\n\nAt t1=24, span: [tail, head] = [-83, -48]\n\nAt time T, span: [ -83 + 36*(T-24), -48 + 36*(T-24) ]\n\nNow, at T=24, span: [ -83 + 0, -48 +0] = [-83, -48], which is all negative, so min=-83, max=-48, both <0, so 0 not in span, so no collision at T=24 on y=4.\n\nGood.\n\nNow, if I go up, at turn 25, I would be on y=5.\n\nFreeway 5 has three cars: (6, -5, right, 6), (-30, -41, right, 6), (48, 37, right, 6)\n\nFirst car: head=6, tail=-5, dir right, s=6\n\nAt t1=24, span: [tail, head] = [-5, 6]\n\nSince tail=-5, head=6, so min=-5, max=6.\n\nAt time T, span: [ -5 + 6*(T-24), 6 + 6*(T-24) ]\n\nSecond car: (-30, -41, right, 6), head=-30, tail=-41, span at t1: [-41, -30]\n\nAt T: [ -41 + 6*(T-24), -30 + 6*(T-24) ]\n\nThird car: (48, 37, right, 6), head=48, tail=37, span at t1: [37,48]\n\nAt T: [37 + 6*(T-24), 48 + 6*(T-24)]\n\nNow, at turn T=25, for freeway 5, check if 0 in any span.\n\nFirst car at T=25: T-24=1, span: [ -5 + 6*1, 6 + 6*1] = [1, 12]\n\n-5 +6=1, 6+6=12, so [1,12], min=1>0, so 0 not in [1,12]\n\nSecond car: [ -41 +6*1, -30 +6*1] = [-35, -24], both negative, 0 not in.\n\nThird car: [37 +6, 48+6] = [43,54], both >0, 0 not in.\n\nSo at T=25, on y=5, no collision.\n\nNow turn 26, if I go up, y=6.\n\nFreeway 6 has same as freeway 5? Freeway 6: (6, -5, right, 6), (-30, -41, right, 6), (48, 37, right, 6) identical to freeway 5.\n\nAt T=26, for freeway 6.\n\nT-24=2\n\nFirst car: [ -5 +6*2, 6 +6*2] = [-5+12, 6+12] = [7,18], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: [ -41 +12, -30+12] = [-29, -18], 0 not in.\n\nThird car: [37+12,48+12]=[49,60], 0 not in.\n\nNo collision.\n\nTurn 27, y=7 if I go up.\n\nFreeway 7: (-48, -59, right, 12)\n\nHead=-48, tail=-59, dir right, s=12\n\nAt t1=24, span: [tail, head] = [-59, -48]\n\nAt T: [ -59 +12*(T-24), -48 +12*(T-24) ]\n\nAt T=27, T-24=3, span: [ -59 + 36, -48 + 36] = [-23, 12]\n\n-59 + 36 = -23? 12*3=36, -59+36=-23, -48+36=-12? -48 + 36 = -12.\n\n[ -59 + 12*3, -48 + 12*3] = [ -59 + 36, -48 + 36] = [-23, -12]\n\n-23 to -12, both negative, so min=-23, max=-12 <0, 0 not in span.\n\nNo collision.\n\nTurn 28, y=8.\n\nFreeway 8: (-16, -27, right, 4)\n\nHead=-16, tail=-27, dir right, s=4\n\nSpan at t1: [tail, head] = [-27, -16]\n\nAt T: [ -27 +4*(T-24), -16 +4*(T-24) ]\n\nAt T=28, T-24=4, span: [ -27 + 16, -16 + 16] = [-11, 0]\n\n-27 + 4*4 = -27+16= -11\n\n-16 + 16 = 0\n\nSo [ -11, 0 ], which includes 0, since min=-11, max=0, so 0 is included.\n\nTherefore, at T=28, on freeway 8, span is [-11,0], which includes x=0, so collision if I am there.\n\nBut in this sequence, at turn 28, I would be on y=8, and collision occurs.\n\nSo I cannot be on y=8 at turn 28.\n\nNow, in the direct up path, at turn 28 I have a collision on y=8.\n\nAt turn 27, I was on y=7, no problem, but at turn 28, on y=8, collision.\n\nI need to avoid that.\n\nI could wait or change the timing.\n\nSince I have to go through y=8 at some point, I need to find a turn when on y=8, no car covers x=0.\n\nSimilarly for other freeways, but in this case, only y=8 has a potential issue at some times.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway, when a car covers x=0.\n\nBut only for the freeways I might be on, y=4 to y=8.\n\ny=4: freeway 4, car span at T: [ -83 + 36*(T-24), -48 + 36*(T-24) ]\n\nSet min <=0 <= max.\n\nSince moving right, min = -83 + 36*(T-24), max = -48 + 36*(T-24)\n\n0 in span if min <=0 and max >=0? Not necessarily, because min and max could be such that 0 is between.\n\nSince it's an interval, 0 in [min,max] iff min <=0 and max >=0.\n\nYes.\n\nSo for freeway 4: min = -83 + 36*(T-24), max = -48 + 36*(T-24)\n\nSet min <=0: -83 + 36*(T-24) <=0 => 36*(T-24) <=83 => T-24 <= 83/36 ≈ 2.305, so T-24 <= 2 since T integer.\n\nSimilarly, max >=0: -48 + 36*(T-24) >=0 => 36*(T-24) >=48 => T-24 >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈1.333, so T-24 >= 2.\n\nThus, T-24 >=2 and T-24 <=2, so T-24=2, T=26.\n\nAt T=26, min = -83 + 36*2 = -83 +72 = -11, max = -48 +72=24, so [ -11,24], 0 in.\n\nBut at other times, not.\n\nFor example, T=25: min= -83+36= -47, max=-48+36=-12? -48+36=-12, both negative.\n\nT=26: min=-83+72=-11, max=-48+72=24, 0 in.\n\nT=27: min=-83+108=25, max=-48+108=60, both positive, 0 not in.\n\nSo only at T=26, on freeway 4, collision possible.\n\nBut since I start at T=24 on y=4, and I might not be there at T=26 if I move up.\n\nIn the direct path, I was on y=4 at T=24, y=5 at T=25, y=6 at T=26, etc., so at T=26 I was on y=6, not y=4, so no issue.\n\nNow freeway 5: three cars.\n\nFirst car: span at T: [ -5 + 6*(T-24), 6 + 6*(T-24) ]\n\n0 in span if min <=0 and max >=0: -5 +6*(T-24) <=0 and 6 +6*(T-24) >=0\n\nFirst inequality: -5 +6k <=0 => 6k <=5 => k <= 5/6 <1, so k=0, T-24=0, T=24\n\nAt T=24, min=-5, max=6, 0 in? min=-5<=0, max=6>=0, yes.\n\nBut at T=24, I am on y=4, not y=5, so no collision.\n\nFor T>24, min increases, at k=1, min=1>0, so no.\n\nSimilarly, second car: [ -41 +6*(T-24), -30 +6*(T-24) ]\n\nmin <=0: -41 +6k <=0 => 6k <=41 => k <=41/6≈6.833, k<=6\n\nmax >=0: -30 +6k >=0 => 6k>=30 => k>=5\n\nSo for k=5,6: T-24=5 or 6, T=29 or 30\n\nAt k=5, min=-41+30=-11, max=-30+30=0, so [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nAt k=6, min=-41+36=-5, max=-30+36=6, [ -5,6], 0 in.\n\nAt other times, not.\n\nThird car: [37 +6k, 48+6k] min=37+6k >0 for k>=0, so never 0 in span.\n\nSo on freeway 5, collision at T=24 (but we not there), T=29,30.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 6, same as freeway 5, since identical cars.\n\nFreeway 6 has same cars, so collision possible at T=29,30.\n\nNow freeway 7: car span at T: [ -59 +12*(T-24), -48 +12*(T-24) ]\n\nmin <=0: -59 +12k <=0 => 12k <=59 => k <= 59/12≈4.916, k<=4\n\nmax >=0: -48 +12k >=0 => 12k >=48 => k>=4\n\nSo k=4, T-24=4, T=28\n\nAt T=28, min=-59+48=-11, max=-48+48=0, [-11,0], 0 in.\n\nOther times not.\n\nFreeway 8: car span at T: [ -27 +4*(T-24), -16 +4*(T-24) ]\n\nmin <=0: -27 +4k <=0 => 4k <=27 => k <= 27/4=6.75, k<=6\n\nmax >=0: -16 +4k >=0 => 4k >=16 => k>=4\n\nSo for k=4,5,6: T=28,29,30\n\nAt k=4, T=28: min=-27+16=-11, max=-16+16=0, [-11,0]\n\nk=5, T=29: min=-27+20=-7, max=-16+20=4, [-7,4]\n\nk=6, T=30: min=-27+24=-3, max=-16+24=8, [-3,8]\n\nAll include 0.\n\nFor k=3, T=27: min=-27+12=-15, max=-16+12=-4, both negative.\n\nk=7, T=31: min=-27+28=1, max=-16+28=12, both positive.\n\nSo collision on y=8 at T=28,29,30.\n\nNow, back to the player.\n\nI start at T=24, y=4, safe.\n\nI want to go to y=9.\n\nTo minimize H, I should go up as fast as possible, but avoid being on a freeway when collision happens.\n\nSpecifically, for y=8, I cannot be there at T=28,29,30.\n\nSimilarly, for y=7, collision at T=28 only? Freeway 7 at T=28, collision.\n\nFreeway 7 at T=28: k=4, collision.\n\nAt other times, no.\n\nFor y=5 and y=6, collision at T=29,30.\n\nNow, the earliest I can reach y=9.\n\nSuppose I go up continuously.\n\nStart T=24, y=4\n\nAfter action U at T=24, y=25=5\n\nAt T=25, on y=5, safe as before.\n\nAfter U at T=25, y=26=6\n\nAt T=26, on y=6, is there collision? Freeway 6 at T=26.\n\nT=26, k=2, for freeway 6.\n\nFirst car: [ -5 +6*2, 6+12] = [7,18], no\n\nSecond car: [ -41+12, -30+12] = [-29,-18], no\n\nThird car: [37+12,48+12]=[49,60], no\n\nNo collision at T=26 on y=6.\n\nThen after U at T=26, y=27=7\n\nAt T=27, on y=7, freeway 7.\n\nT=27, k=3, span [ -59 +12*3, -48 +36] = [-59+36, -48+36] = [-23,-12], both negative, no collision.\n\nThen after U at T=27, y=28=8\n\nAt T=28, on y=8, but as we saw, collision at T=28 on y=8.\n\nProblem.\n\nIf I go to y=8 at T=28, collision.\n\nBut I need to be on y=8 at some point to go to y=9.\n\nI could wait at some y before.\n\nFor example, at T=27, I am on y=7, safe.\n\nInstead of going up to y=8 at T=28, I could stay on y=7 for one turn.\n\nSo at T=27, I take action S, stay, so y=27=7, then at T=28, I am still on y=7.\n\nBut at T=28, on y=7, freeway 7 has collision? At T=28, k=4, span [-11,0], includes 0, so collision at T=28 on y=7.\n\nFreeway 7 at T=28: k=4, min=-59+48=-11, max=-48+48=0, yes [ -11,0], 0 included, so collision.\n\nSo at T=28, if I am on y=7, collision.\n\nSimilarly, if I stay on y=6 or others.\n\nAt T=27, I am on y=7, safe, but if I stay, at T=28 on y=7, collision.\n\nSo I cannot stay on y=7 at T=28.\n\nI could go down, but that might not help.\n\nSince y=8 has collision from T=28 to 30, and y=7 at T=28, I need to avoid being on y=7 or y=8 at T=28.\n\nAt T=27, I am on y=7, which is safe at T=27.\n\nBut I have to leave or stay.\n\nIf I go down to y=6 at T=28.\n\nAction at T=27: D, so y=28 = y=27 + Δy, if a_t=D, y_{t+1} = y_t -1.\n\nAt turn t, action a_t determines Δy_t, so y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nAt turn t, I am at y_t.\n\nAfter action a_t, I go to y_{t+1}.\n\nFor example, at T=27, I am at y=7.\n\nIf I take U, y=28=8\n\nIf S, y=28=7\n\nIf D, y=28=6\n\nAt T=27, on y=7, safe.\n\nIf I take D, then at T=28, I am on y=6.\n\nNow, at T=28, on y=6, is there collision?\n\nFreeway 6 at T=28, k=4.\n\nFirst car: [ -5 +6*4, 6+24] = [-5+24, 6+24] = [19,30], no\n\nSecond car: [ -41 +24, -30+24] = [-17,-6], both negative, no\n\nThird car: [37+24,48+24]=[61,72], no\n\nNo collision on y=6 at T=28.\n\nSimilarly, at T=28, I am on y=6, safe.\n\nNow, I need to go up to y=9.\n\nBut y=8 has issues at T=28,29,30.\n\nAfter T=28, I am on y=6.\n\nThen I can go up.\n\nBut y=8 is blocked until T=31.\n\nAt T=31, on y=8, freeway 8: k=7, min=-27+28=1, max=-16+28=12, [1,12], no 0, safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=7 at T=31: freeway 7, k=7, min=-59+84=25, max=-48+84=36, both positive, safe.\n\nBut I need to get to y=8.\n\nLet's see the timing.\n\nI am at T=24, y=4\n\nT=24: action? I need to go up eventually.\n\nTo save time, I should go up when possible.\n\nAt T=24: on y=4, safe, take U, to y=5\n\nT=25: on y=5, safe, take U to y=6\n\nT=26: on y=6, safe, take U to y=7\n\nT=27: on y=7, safe. Now instead of U, I take D to y=6? But that seems backward.\n\nAt T=27, take D, so y=28=6\n\nThen at T=28, on y=6, safe as above.\n\nNow from here, I need to go to y=7,8,9.\n\nBut y=7 at T=28 has collision, as we saw.\n\nAt T=28, if I go to y=7, but at T=28 I am on y=6, action at T=28.\n\nAt T=28, I am on y=6, take action.\n\nIf I take U, then y=29=7\n\nAt T=29, on y=7.\n\nFreeway 7 at T=29: k=5, min=-59+60=1, max=-48+60=12, [1,12], no 0, safe? Earlier for freeway 7, collision only at T=28.\n\nAt T=29, k=5, min=-59+60=1, max=-48+60=12, both positive, so no collision.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8 at T=29: k=5, min=-27+20=-7, max=-16+20=4, [-7,4], 0 in, collision on y=8, but I not on it yet.\n\nAt T=29, on y=7, freeway 7 is safe at T=29.\n\nThen I can take U at T=29 to y=30=8\n\nBut at T=30, on y=8, collision? Freeway 8 at T=30: k=6, min=-27+24=-3, max=-16+24=8, [-3,8], 0 in, collision.\n\nProblem.\n\nIf at T=29 I take U to y=30=8, then at T=30 on y=8 collision.\n\nIf I take S at T=29, stay on y=7, but at T=30 on y=7, freeway 7 at T=30: k=6, min=-59+72=13, max=-48+72=24, both positive, safe.\n\nThen at T=30, on y=7, I can take U to y=31=8\n\nAt T=31, on y=8, freeway 8: k=7, min=-27+28=1, max=-16+28=12, [1,12], no 0, safe.\n\nThen take U to y=32=9, at T=32, y=9, safe.\n\nBut this takes more turns.\n\nLet's count the turns.\n\nStart T=24, y=4\n\nT=24: U, y=25=5\n\nT=25: U, y=26=6\n\nT=26: U, y=27=7\n\nT=27: D? Earlier I took D at T=27 to go to y=6 at T=28.\n\nIn this new path: at T=27, take D, so y=28=6\n\nThen T=28: on y=6, I can take U to y=29=7\n\nT=29: on y=7, safe (as above)\n\nThen at T=29, take U to y=30=8? But at T=30 on y=8 collision.\n\nTake S at T=29, stay on y=7, so y=30=7\n\nT=30: on y=7, safe, then take U to y=31=8\n\nT=31: on y=8, safe, then take U to y=32=9\n\nT=32: y=9.\n\nBut at T=27, I took D to go down to y=6, which is inefficient.\n\nSince at T=27 I am on y=7, safe, and I know y=7 has collision only at T=28, so if I can be on y=7 only at T=27, not at T=28.\n\nBut at T=27 I am there, and I need to leave.\n\nIf I go up to y=8 at T=28, collision on y=8.\n\nIf I go down to y=6 at T=28, then I have to come back up.\n\nBut y=8 is blocked from T=28 to 30, so I need to reach y=8 at T=31 or later.\n\nThe earliest to reach y=8 safely is T=31.\n\nThen to reach y=9 at T=32.\n\nNow, from start, I can go directly to y=7 by T=27, as before.\n\nT=24: U to y=5\n\nT=25: U to y=6\n\nT=26: U to y=7\n\nT=27: now at y=7, I need to wait or something.\n\nBut at T=27, if I take S, stay, then at T=28 on y=7, collision.\n\nIf I take D to y=6, then at T=28 on y=6.\n\nThen from y=6, I can go to y=7 at T=29.\n\nT=28: on y=6, take U to y=29=7\n\nT=29: on y=7, safe\n\nThen take U to y=30=8? But at T=30 on y=8 collision.\n\nSo I need to stay on y=7 at T=29, or go up later.\n\nAt T=29, on y=7, take S, so y=30=7\n\nT=30: on y=7, safe (since freeway 7 at T=30 safe), then take U to y=31=8\n\nT=31: on y=8, safe, U to y=32=9.\n\nBut this is slow.\n\nI could reach y=8 earlier if possible, but not at T=28,29,30.\n\nT=27 is possible? At T=27 on y=7, if I go to y=8 at T=28, but T=28 on y=8 collision.\n\nUnless I can be on y=8 at T=27, but at T=27 I am on y=7, I can only be at y=8 at T=28 if I take U at T=27.\n\nNo.\n\nAnother idea: since the collision on y=8 starts at T=28, if I can be on y=8 before T=28.\n\nBut T=27, I am at y=7, so earliest y=8 is T=28.\n\nNot possible.\n\nSo I must be on y=8 at T=31 or later.\n\nSimilarly for y=7, I can be on it at T=27 or T=29,30,31, etc., but not at T=28.\n\nT=27 is safe for y=7, T=28 not, T=29 safe, etc.\n\nTo minimize H, I should go to y=7 as fast as possible, then wait or something until I can go to y=8.\n\nBut I have to be careful with the waiting place.\n\nLet's list the safe times for each freeway.\n\nFor freeway 5 (y=5): collision at T=29,30\n\nSafe at other times, including T=25,26,27,28,31,etc.\n\nSimilarly freeway 6 same as 5.\n\nFreeway 7 (y=7): collision only at T=28\n\nSafe at T=27,29,30,31,...\n\nFreeway 8 (y=8): collision at T=28,29,30\n\nSafe at T=27? T=27: k=3 for freeway 8? T=27, T-24=3\n\nmin = -27 +4*3 = -27+12=-15, max=-16+12=-4, both negative, so at T=27, on y=8, is it safe?\n\nBut I can only be on y=8 at T=27 if I arrived earlier, but at T=26, I am at y=6 or 7.\n\nSuppose I go faster up.\n\nFrom start: T=24, y=4, take U to y=5\n\nT=25, y=5, take U to y=6\n\nT=26, y=6, now instead of U to y=7, I could go directly to y=8? But I can only change by 1 per turn, so at T=26, I am at y=6, I can go to y=7 at T=27, not directly to y=8.\n\nCannot.\n\nSo impossible to be on y=8 before T=28.\n\nTherefore, the earliest safe time for y=8 is T=31.\n\nSimilarly, for y=7, I can be on it at T=27 (safe), or T=29,30,31 (safe), but not T=28.\n\nNow, to reach y=9 quickly, I should be at y=8 at T=31, then y=9 at T=32.\n\nNow, I need to be at y=8 at T=31.\n\nAt T=31, y=8.\n\nThen at T=31, take U, to y=32=9.\n\nNow, to be at y=8 at T=31, I need to have y_t for t=31.\n\ny_{31} =8.\n\nSince I start at y_{24}=4, I need to increase by 4, so minimum 4 actions U, but I might have some S or D, so it could take more turns.\n\nThe number of U actions must be at least 5 to go from 4 to 9, but since I might go down, it could be more.\n\nTo reach y=8 from y=4, I need +4, so at least 4 U actions.\n\nWith possible S or D, the turn count increases.\n\nBut to minimize H, I should avoid unnecessary moves.\n\nNow, from T=24 to T=31, there are 7 turns: actions at T=24 to T=30, 7 actions, to reach y_{31}=8.\n\ny_{31} = y_{30} + Δy_{30}, and so on.\n\nSet the actions.\n\nI need y_{31} =8.\n\nI start y_{24}=4.\n\nSo net change +4.\n\nEach U: +1, D: -1, S: 0.\n\nNumber of U minus number of D must be 4.\n\nTotal turns from T=24 to T=30, 7 actions, to set y_{31}.\n\ny_{31} = y_{24} + sum_{t=24 to 30} Δy_t\n\nSince y_{24} is fixed, y_{31} = 4 + sum_{t=24}^{30} Δy_t\n\nΔy_t = +1, -1, 0.\n\ny_{31} = 4 + (number of U from t=24 to 30) - (number of D from t=24 to 30)\n\nSet this equal to 8.\n\nSo 4 + U - D = 8, so U - D = 4.\n\nAlso, let S be number of S, then U + D + S = 7, since 7 actions.\n\nU - D = 4\n\nU + D + S = 7\n\nAdd them: 2U + S = 11\n\nSubtract: 2D + S = 3\n\nSince S >=0, D <=1.5, so D=0 or 1.\n\nIf D=0, then U=4, S=3\n\nIf D=1, U=5, S=1\n\nNow, I need to avoid collisions during the path.\n\nI also need to be at safe positions at each turn.\n\nThe turns are T=24 to T=30 for actions, and positions at T=24 to T=30, and at T=31 I am on y=8 for collision check? At T=31, I am on y=8, but since I take action to go to y=9, but at T=31, I am on y=8, so I need to check collision on y=8 at T=31, which is safe as we saw.\n\nThen at T=31, take U to y=32=9, no issue.\n\nNow, the positions to check: at each turn T from 24 to 31, I am on y_T, need no collision on that freeway at T.\n\nT=24: y=4, safe as before.\n\nT=25: y=5, need safe\n\nT=26: y=6, need safe\n\nT=27: y=7, need safe but not at T=28? T=27 is separate.\n\nAt each turn, as long as at that turn, the freeway is safe.\n\nFor y=5, safe except T=29,30\n\nSimilarly y=6 except T=29,30\n\ny=7 except T=28\n\ny=8 except T=28,29,30\n\nSince we are going to be at T=24 to T=30, and y_{31}=8.\n\nT=31 is when we are on y=8.\n\nNow, for T=24 to T=30, we are at y_t for t=24 to 30.\n\ny_t for t=24,25,26,27,28,29,30.\n\nWe need these to be safe at their times.\n\nSince we want to reach y=8 at T=31, and T=31 is safe for y=8.\n\nNow, to minimize H, H is the number of actions to reach turn t_1 + H with y=9.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t_1 + H, y=9.\n\nHere, if at T=31, y=8, then I need one more action to go to y=9.\n\nSet t_1 =24.\n\nAfter actions at t=24 to 30 (7 actions), at T=31, y=8.\n\nThen action at T=31: U, to y=32=9.\n\nSo at T=32, y=9.\n\nThus, H=8 actions: from t=24 to t=31, actions at t=24 to 31? Let's see.\n\nActions: from t=24 to t=31 inclusive? No.\n\nThe sequence: actions at turns t_1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nt from 0 to H-1, so turns t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nAfter H actions, position at turn t_1 + H.\n\nWe want position at turn t_1 + H to be (0,9).\n\nHere, t_1=24.\n\nSet turn when y=9 is T=32.\n\nThen at T=32, y=9, so t_1 + H =32, so 24 + H =32, H=8.\n\nActions at turns 24 to 31 (t=0 to 7, 8 actions).\n\nThen position at turn 32: y=9.\n\nSimilarly, in this case, at T=31, y=8, which is safe.\n\nNow, to have y=8 at T=31, we need to set the path from T=24 to T=30.\n\ny_{31} = y_{30} + Δy_{30}\n\ny_{31} =8.\n\ny_{30} depends on previous.\n\nWe need to define y_t for t=24 to 31.\n\ny_{24} =4\n\ny_{31} =8\n\nWith actions from t=24 to 30 determining y_{25} to y_{31}.\n\nSpecifically, y_{25} = y_{24} + Δy_{24}\n\ny_{26} = y_{25} + Δy_{25} = y_{24} + Δy_{24} + Δy_{25}\n\n...\n\ny_{31} = y_{24} + sum_{k=24}^{30} Δy_k = 4 + sum_{k=24}^{30} Δy_k\n\nSet this to 8, so sum_{k=24}^{30} Δy_k = 4\n\nΔy_k = +1, -1, 0.\n\nSo net U - D =4 over 7 actions.\n\nAs before.\n\nTo minimize time, we should use as few S or D as possible, so prefer U - D =4 with U=4, D=0, S=3, or U=5, D=1, S=1, etc.\n\nBut we need to avoid collisions at the positions.\n\nNow, the critical points are that we cannot be on y=7 at T=28, cannot be on y=5 or y=6 at T=29,30, and cannot be on y=8 at T=28,29,30, but T=30 is within the range.\n\nList the forbidden (y,T) pairs:\n\n- (y=5, T=29), (y=5, T=30)\n\n- (y=6, T=29), (y=6, T=30)\n\n- (y=7, T=28)\n\n- (y=8, T=28), (y=8, T=29), (y=8, T=30)\n\nFor other times, safe.\n\nWe need to set a path from T=24, y=4 to T=31, y=8.\n\nWith positions at T=24 to T=30 for collision check, and T=31 on y=8.\n\nT=31 y=8 is safe.\n\nNow, T=24: y=4, must be, and safe.\n\nWe need to go to y=8 by T=31.\n\nSince we have to increase y by 4 in 7 steps, we can have some stays.\n\nBut to be efficient, we can go up to y=7 quickly, then stay or move to avoid the bad times.\n\nFor example:\n\nAt T=24: y=4, take U, so y_{25}=5\n\nT=25: on y=5, safe (since T=25 not forbidden for y=5), take U, y_{26}=6\n\nT=26: on y=6, safe (T=26 not forbidden), take U, y_{27}=7\n\nT=27: on y=7, safe (T=27 safe for y=7), now I need to not be on y=7 at T=28, so I must leave y=7 at T=27 action.\n\nIf I take U, y_{28}=8, but at T=28 on y=8 collision.\n\nIf I take D, y_{28}=6\n\nThen at T=28, on y=6.\n\nNow, T=28, on y=6, is it safe? For y=6, forbidden at T=29,30, but T=28 is not forbidden, so should be safe.\n\nAt T=28, freeway 6, as earlier, k=4, no car covers 0, so safe.\n\nThen at T=28, I am on y=6, I can take action.\n\nI need to go to y=7 or y=8 eventually.\n\nBut y=7 at T=28 is forbidden, collision.\n\nAt T=28, if I take U, y_{29}=7, then at T=29 on y=7.\n\nT=29, on y=7: freeway 7 at T=29 is safe, as min=1, max=12, no 0.\n\nThen at T=29, I can take U to y_{30}=8, but at T=30 on y=8 collision.\n\nTake S, stay on y=7, y_{30}=7\n\nThen at T=30, on y=7, freeway 7 at T=30: k=6, min=13, max=24, safe.\n\nThen take U to y_{31}=8\n\nAt T=31, on y=8, safe.\n\nThen U to y_{32}=9.\n\nIn this path:\n\nT=24: action U, to y=5\n\nT=25: action U, to y=6\n\nT=26: action U, to y=7\n\nT=27: action D, to y=6? y_{28}=6\n\nT=28: action? Now at T=28, on y=6, I take S or U?\n\nIf I take U, to y=7 at T=29.\n\nBut then at T=29 on y=7, I need to go to y=8.\n\nBut if I take U at T=29, to y=30=8, collision at T=30.\n\nSo better to take S at T=28.\n\nT=28: on y=6, take S, so y_{29}=6? Action at T=28, S, so Δy=0, y_{29}=y_{28}=6\n\nThen at T=29, on y=6.\n\nBut y=6 at T=29 is forbidden, collision.\n\nFreeway 6 at T=29: k=5, second car min=-41+30=-11, max=-30+30=0, [ -11,0], 0 in, collision.\n\nSo cannot be on y=6 at T=29.\n\nTherefore, at T=28, on y=6, I cannot stay, because if I stay, at T=29 on y=6 collision.\n\nI must move.\n\nTake U to y=7 at T=29.\n\nThen at T=29, on y=7, which is safe, as above.\n\nThen at T=29, on y=7, I can take S to stay, or U to go up.\n\nIf take U, to y=30=8, but at T=30 on y=8 collision.\n\nSo take S at T=29, to y_{30}=7\n\nThen at T=30, on y=7, safe.\n\nThen take U to y_{31}=8\n\nAt T=31, on y=8, safe.\n\nThen U to y_{32}=9.\n\nNow, in this path, at T=27 I took D to y=6 at T=28.\n\nBut that down move might be avoidable.\n\nAnother path: since at T=27 I am on y=7, safe, and I need to not be on y=7 at T=28, so I must change to y=6 or y=8.\n\nBut y=8 at T=28 collision, so only choice is to go down to y=6 at T=28.\n\nThen at T=28 on y=6, safe.\n\nThen to avoid y=6 at T=29, I must go to y=7 or y=5 at T=29.\n\ny=5 at T=29 collision? y=5 forbidden at T=29,30.\n\nSo I must go to y=7 at T=29.\n\nThen at T=29 on y=7, safe.\n\nThen to avoid y=7 at T=30? T=30 on y=7 is safe, but I need to go to y=8.\n\nBut if I go to y=8 at T=30, collision.\n\nSo I stay on y=7 at T=29, so take S, y_{30}=7\n\nThen at T=30 on y=7, safe, then take U to y_{31}=8\n\nAt T=31 on y=8, safe.\n\nSo the down move is necessary to avoid the collision times.\n\nCan I reach y=8 at T=31 without going down?\n\nFor example, if I stay longer at lower y.\n\nBut that might take more time.\n\nSuppose at T=24, I take U to y=5\n\nT=25, U to y=6\n\nT=26, instead of U, take S or something.\n\nBut I need to go up.\n\nAt T=26, on y=6, safe, if I take S, stay, y_{27}=6\n\nAt T=27, on y=6, is it safe? T=27, k=3 for freeway 6.\n\nFirst car: [ -5+18, 6+18] = [13,24], no\n\nSecond car: [ -41+18, -30+18] = [-23,-12], no\n\nThird car: [37+18,48+18]=[55,66], no, safe.\n\nThen at T=27, on y=6, I can take U to y_{28}=7\n\nBut at T=28 on y=7, collision, as before.\n\nNot good.\n\nTake U at T=27 to y_{28}=7, same issue.\n\nIf I stay at y=6 longer.\n\nAt T=26, S, y_{27}=6\n\nT=27, on y=6, take S again, y_{28}=6\n\nAt T=28, on y=6, safe (as earlier)\n\nThen at T=28, take U to y_{29}=7\n\nT=29, on y=7, safe\n\nThen take S to y_{30}=7 (since if U to y=8, T=30 collision)\n\nT=30, on y=7, safe\n\nThen U to y_{31}=8\n\nT=31, on y=8, safe.\n\nThen U to y_{32}=9.\n\nBut this has more S actions, so same or more turns.\n\nCompared to the first path with one D.\n\nIn the first path with D: actions\n\nT=24: U to y=5\n\nT=25: U to y=6\n\nT=26: U to y=7\n\nT=27: D to y=6 (so y=6 at T=28)\n\nT=28: U to y=7? Then at T=29 on y=7\n\nBut if T=28: on y=6, take U to y_{29}=7\n\nT=29: on y=7, take S to y_{30}=7\n\nT=30: on y=7, take U to y_{31}=8\n\nT=31: on y=8, take U to y_{32}=9\n\nActions: U,U,U,D,U,S,U,U\n\nThat's 8 actions, to turn 31, y=8, then U to 9.\n\nBut H=8 actions to reach turn 32 y=9.\n\nIn terms of sequence: actions at t=24 to 31.\n\nAfter 8 actions, turn t_1 + H =24 + H =32, so H=8.\n\nNow, in this, at T=29 I took S, but I could take U if possible, but at T=30 on y=8 collision.\n\nUnless I can reach y=8 later, but T=31 is fine.\n\nBut to save one turn, I need to reach y=9 earlier.\n\nIs it possible to reach y=9 before T=32?\n\nFor example, if I can be on y=9 at T=31 or earlier.\n\nBut to be on y=9, I need to go through y=8.\n\nEarliest y=8 safely at T=31, so y=9 at T=32.\n\nIf I could be on y=8 at T=27, impossible.\n\nOr, if I skip y=8 during bad times, but no.\n\nAnother idea: since y=0 and y=9 are safe, I could go to y=0 or something, but that would take more turns, not helpful.\n\nSo minimum H=8, with y=9 at T=32.\n\nNow, in the path above, with actions: U,U,U,D,U,S,U,U\n\nBut let's write the actions:\n\nAt T=24: U\n\nT=25: U\n\nT=26: U\n\nT=27: D\n\nT=28: U\n\nT=29: S\n\nT=30: U  (to y=8 at T=31)\n\nT=31: U  (to y=9 at T=32)\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t=24 to t=31.\n\nNow, check collisions:\n\nT=24: y=4, safe\n\nT=25: y=5, safe (T=25 not forbidden)\n\nT=26: y=6, safe\n\nT=27: y=7, safe\n\nT=28: y=6? After action at T=27: D, so at T=28, y= y_{28} = y_{27} + Δy_{27} =7 + (-1) =6, so on y=6.\n\nAt T=28, y=6, as before, no collision.\n\nT=29: after action at T=28: U, so y_{29} = y_{28} +1 =6+1=7, on y=7.\n\nAt T=29, y=7, freeway 7: k=5, min=1, max=12, no 0, safe.\n\nT=30: after action at T=29: S, so y_{30} = y_{29} +0 =7, on y=7.\n\nAt T=30, y=7, freeway 7: k=6, min=13, max=24, no 0, safe.\n\nT=31: after action at T=30: U, so y_{31} =7+1=8, on y=8.\n\nAt T=31, y=8, freeway 8: k=7, min=1, max=12, no 0, safe.\n\nThen action at T=31: U to y=9, no issue.\n\nNow, at T=31, we take action U to go to y=9, but the collision at T=31 is on y=8, which is safe.\n\nIn the sequence, we need actions to reach y=9 at turn 32.\n\nIn the answer, we need to list the actions from turn t_1 onwards.\n\nt_1=24.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 24: U\n\nTurn 25: U\n\nTurn 26: U\n\nTurn 27: D\n\nTurn 28: U\n\nTurn 29: S\n\nTurn 30: U  (this U is to go from y=7 to y=8 at T=31? Action at T=30: U, so from y_{30}=7 to y_{31}=8)\n\nThen Turn 31: U to y_{32}=9\n\nSo actions at 24 to 31.\n\nNow, H=8.\n\nBut can I avoid the D and S?\n\nFor example, if I go directly to y=7 and stay, but I cannot stay at T=28.\n\nAnother path: suppose at T=26, I don't go to y=7 immediately.\n\nT=24: U to y=5\n\nT=25: U to y=6\n\nT=26: S, stay y=6\n\nT=27: S, stay y=6? But at T=27 on y=6 safe.\n\nThen T=28: on y=6, take U to y_{29}=7\n\nT=29: on y=7, safe, take S to y_{30}=7\n\nT=30: on y=7, take U to y_{31}=8\n\nT=31: on y=8, safe, U to y=9.\n\nBut actions: U,U,S,S,U,S,U,U\n\nStill 8 actions, with more S.\n\nWorse.\n\nAt T=26, take U to y=7\n\nT=27, take S? But at T=28 on y=7 collision, so cannot.\n\nMust move down.\n\nSo the down move seems necessary to avoid the collision on y=7 at T=28.\n\nSince I go down to y=6 at T=28, which is safe, then up to y=7 at T=29, which is safe.\n\nThen I have to stay at T=29 to avoid going to y=8 at T=30.\n\nIf I could go from y=7 to y=9 directly, but no.\n\nSo I think the path is fine.\n\nNow, to confirm, let's see if I can reach earlier with different sequence.\n\nSuppose at T=27, I go down to y=6, then at T=28, instead of going up, I stay or something, but then I might be late.\n\nFor example, T=27: D to y=6\n\nT=28: on y=6, take S, but if I take S, y_{29}=6, then at T=29 on y=6 collision, bad.\n\nSo I must take U at T=28 to go to y=7 at T=29.\n\nNo choice.\n\nThus, the sequence is as above.\n\nNow, for the answer, H=8, actions:\n\nTurn 24: U\n\nTurn 25: U\n\nTurn 26: U\n\nTurn 27: D\n\nTurn 28: U\n\nTurn 29: S\n\nTurn 30: U\n\nTurn 31: U\n\nIn Turn 30: U, to go to y=8 at T=31.\n\nThen Turn 31: U to y=9 at T=32.\n\nIn the sequence, it should be actions from t=24 to t=31 for H=8.\n\nBut let's write the y positions to confirm:\n\nT=24: y=4 (start)\n\nAction U: y_{25} =5\n\nT=25: y=5, action U: y_{26}=6\n\nT=26: y=6, action U: y_{27}=7\n\nT=27: y=7, action D: y_{28}=6\n\nT=28: y=6, action U: y_{29}=7\n\nT=29: y=7, action S: y_{30}=7\n\nT=30: y=7, action U: y_{31}=8\n\nT=31: y=8, action U: y_{32}=9\n\nCollision checks:\n\nT=24: y=4, safe\n\nT=25: y=5, safe (freeway 5 at T=25: k=1, [1,12], no 0)\n\nT=26: y=6, safe (k=2, [7,18], etc.)\n\nT=27: y=7, safe (k=3, [-23,-12], no 0)\n\nT=28: y=6, safe (k=4, freeway 6: [19,30], [-17,-6], [61,72], no 0)\n\nT=29: y=7, safe (k=5, [1,12] for freeway 7)\n\nT=30: y=7, safe (k=6, [13,24])\n\nT=31: y=8, safe (k=7, [1,12])\n\nAll good.\n\nNow, is there a way with H=7?\n\nH=7 actions, to reach turn t_1 + H =24+7=31 with y=9.\n\nBut y=9 at T=31.\n\nTo be at y=9 at T=31.\n\ny_{31} =9.\n\ny_{24}=4, so need net +5 in 7 actions.\n\ny_{31} = y_{24} + sum_{t=24}^{30} Δy_t =4 + U - D =9, so U - D =5.\n\nU + D + S =7.\n\nThen U - D =5, add: 2U + S =12, so U=6, S=0, D=1? 2U + S=12, U + D + S=7, subtract: U - D =5, so from 2U + S=12 and U + D + S=7, subtract the second: (2U+S) - (U+D+S) =12-7 => U - D =5, consistent.\n\nIf U=6, S=0, D=1, then U+D+S=7, U-D=5.\n\nOr U=5, but 2U+S=12, if U=5, S=2, then U-D=5, so 5-D=5, D=0, then U+S=7, 5+S=7, S=2, D=0, U-D=5-0=5, yes.\n\nOr U=6, S=0, D=1.\n\nBut with D=1, U=6, S=0 or U=5, S=2, D=0.\n\nNow, to reach y=9 at T=31, I need to be on y=8 at T=30, since action at T=30 U to y=9 at T=31.\n\nAt T=30, I am on y=8, take U to y=9.\n\nBut at T=30, on y=8, collision! As we saw, freeway 8 at T=30 has collision.\n\nCannot be on y=8 at T=30.\n\nSimilarly, if I am on y=9 at T=31, but to be on y=9, I need to be on y=8 at some T, take U to y=9.\n\nThe turn before, at T, on y=8, take U to y_{T+1}=9.\n\nAt that turn T, I am on y=8, so need no collision at T.\n\nBut at T=30, collision on y=8.\n\nAt T=31, I can be on y=8, safe, take U to y=9 at T=32.\n\nBut for T=31, y=9.\n\nIf I want y=9 at T=31, I need to be on y=8 at T=30, take U at T=30 to y_{31}=9.\n\nBut at T=30, on y=8, collision, impossible.\n\nSimilarly, earlier times not possible.\n\nTherefore, cannot reach y=9 before T=32.\n\nThus minimal H is 8.\n\nAnd the sequence as above.\n\nIn the action list, for turn 29, I have S, which is fine.\n\nNow, to write the answer.\n\nThe actions are for turns starting from t_1=24.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 24: U\n\nTurn 25: U\n\nTurn 26: U\n\nTurn 27: D\n\nTurn 28: U\n\nTurn 29: S\n\nTurn 30: U\n\nTurn 31: U\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let's confirm the car on freeway 8 at different times.\n\nFreeway 8: at T=28: k=4, span [-11,0], collision\n\nT=29: k=5, [-7,4], collision\n\nT=30: k=6, [-3,8], collision\n\nT=31: k=7, [1,12], no collision.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nYes.\n\nSo I think this is minimal.\n</think>\nTo reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 4) at turn 24 with the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8, the following sequence of actions is determined to be optimal, requiring 8 turns (H=8). The sequence avoids all collision points by timing movements to be on critical freeways only when safe, as per the car positions and movements.\n\n### Key Collision Avoidance:\n- **Freeway 4 (y=4)**: Safe at all relevant times (no collision at turn 24).\n- **Freeway 5 (y=5)**: Collision at turns 29 and 30; safe at turn 25.\n- **Freeway 6 (y=6)**: Collision at turns 29 and 30; safe at turns 26 and 28.\n- **Freeway 7 (y=7)**: Collision at turn 28; safe at turns 27, 29, and 30.\n- **Freeway 8 (y=8)**: Collision at turns 28, 29, and 30; safe at turn 31.\n\n### Action Sequence:\n- **Turn 24**: Action U (move up to y=5 at turn 25). Position at turn 24: (0,4), safe (freeway 4 has no car covering x=0).\n- **Turn 25**: Action U (move up to y=6 at turn 26). Position at turn 25: (0,5), safe (freeway 5 at turn 25: car spans do not cover x=0).\n- **Turn 26**: Action U (move up to y=7 at turn 27). Position at turn 26: (0,6), safe (freeway 6 at turn 26: car spans do not cover x=0).\n- **Turn 27**: Action D (move down to y=6 at turn 28). Position at turn 27: (0,7), safe (freeway 7 at turn 27: car span [-23, -12] does not cover x=0). Moving down avoids collision on y=7 at turn 28.\n- **Turn 28**: Action U (move up to y=7 at turn 29). Position at turn 28: (0,6), safe (freeway 6 at turn 28: car spans do not cover x=0). Moving up avoids collision on y=6 at turn 29.\n- **Turn 29**: Action S (stay at y=7 for turn 30). Position at turn 29: (0,7), safe (freeway 7 at turn 29: car span [1, 12] does not cover x=0). Staying avoids collision on y=8 at turn 30.\n- **Turn 30**: Action U (move up to y=8 at turn 31). Position at turn 30: (0,7), safe (freeway 7 at turn 30: car span [13, 24] does not cover x=0).\n- **Turn 31**: Action U (move up to y=9 at turn 32). Position at turn 31: (0,8), safe (freeway 8 at turn 31: car span [1, 12] does not cover x=0).\n\nAfter these 8 actions, at turn 32 (t_1 + H = 24 + 8), the position is (0, 9), which is safe with no cars.\n\nThis sequence achieves the goal in the minimal H=8 turns, as it is impossible to reach (0,9) before turn 32 due to collisions on freeway 8 at turns 28-30 and the need to traverse intermediate freeways safely.\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 24:\\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 25:\\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 26:\\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 27:\\, D \\\\ \\text{Turn } 28:\\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 29:\\, S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 30:\\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 31:\\, U }",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 25, and the player is at (0,5). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns, avoiding collisions.\n\n The grid has freeways at y=1 to y=8. The player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S). The movement is only in the y-direction (vertical). The x-coordinate is always 0 for the player.\n\n Important: Collision occurs at turn T if the player is on a freeway y (which must be between 1 and 8) and at that turn T, there is a car on that freeway such that 0 (the player's x) is in the car's span at turn T.\n\n Note: When moving from y to y' at turn T, note that:\n   - At the moment of turn T (when we are about to execute the action), we are still on y (so we check freeway y at turn T).\n   - After the action, we are at y' at turn T+1, and then we check freeway y' at turn T+1.\n\n However, note the rule: \n   \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} != y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T\"\n\n So, at turn T, we are on freeway y_T. At turn T, we check the car on freeway y_T at turn T. Then we move and at turn T+1 we are on y_{T+1}, and then we check freeway y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\n The goal is to have the player at y=9. Note that y=9 is the top and there are no cars (since cars are only on freeways 1-8). So once we get to y=9 we are safe.\n\n We start at y=5 at turn 25.\n\n We need to plan a sequence of actions (U, D, S) that moves the player from y=5 to y=9 in minimal turns without colliding.\n\n How to model the cars?\n\n For each freeway k (from 1 to 8), we have a list of cars. Each car is given by (head, tail, direction, speed) at turn t1=25.\n\n The car moves at constant speed. The direction is either 'left' or 'right'. But note the update:\n\n   Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] -> at turn T: [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]\n   Right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] -> at turn T: [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\n However, note the representation in the input:\n\n   For freeway 1: (-24, -47, right, 24) -> this is a right-moving car. But note that for a right-moving car, the head is the larger coordinate? \n   Actually, the problem says: for a right-moving car, the span at t1 is [τ, h] meaning from tail to head (in increasing order). So in the input, the first number is the head? But wait:\n\n   The input says: \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\n   For a right-moving car, the head is at a larger x than the tail. So the span is [τ, h]. Therefore, at t1, the car occupies from τ to h (with τ <= h).\n\n   Similarly, for a left-moving car, the head is at a smaller x? The problem says: left-moving: span(t1)=[h, τ] meaning from head to tail, but note that if the car is moving left, then the head is the front, so it would be at a smaller x? Actually, the update rule for left: [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)] and for right: [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n\n   But note: the representation in the input for a right-moving car: (head, tail) = (-24, -47). Since -24 > -47, that matches: head is the larger number.\n\n   However, the problem says for right-moving: the span at t1 is [τ, h] meaning the tail is at τ and the head at h? But then the car covers [τ, h]. So if τ = -47 and h = -24, then the car covers [-47, -24]. Then at time T, it moves to [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)] = [-47 + 24*(T-25), -24 + 24*(T-25)].\n\n   Similarly, for a left-moving car, the input would have head and tail? The problem doesn't specify, but the update rule for left uses head and tail. However, note that in the input we don't have any left-moving car. All cars in this state are right-moving.\n\n   So we only need to handle right-moving cars.\n\n   How collision is defined: at turn T, if the player is on freeway k (so y_T = k) and at that turn T, there is a car on freeway k such that the player's x=0 is in the car's span at T.\n\n   Therefore, for a car on freeway k at turn T (with T>=t1), we compute:\n        if the car is right-moving: \n            tail_T = τ + s*(T - t1)\n            head_T = h + s*(T - t1)\n            then the span is [tail_T, head_T] (which is an interval from tail_T to head_T, inclusive? the problem doesn't specify, but we assume continuous? Actually, the grid is discrete? The problem doesn't specify the grid for x, but the cars are defined by real numbers? However, the collision condition is 0 in the span. Since the x-coordinate of the player is 0, we can think of the car as covering a continuous interval.\n\n   But note: the problem says \"collision occurs at turn T only if 0 is in Span(T)\". So we need 0 to be between tail_T and head_T (inclusive).\n\n   For example, freeway 1 at turn 25: car = (-24, -47, right, 24)\n        tail_25 = -47 + 24*(25-25) = -47\n        head_25 = -24 + 24*(0) = -24\n        So the car covers [-47, -24] at turn 25. 0 is not in this interval -> safe.\n\n   We need to check for each freeway we step on at each turn T.\n\n We are starting at turn 25 at y=5.\n\n We want the minimal H such that we can be at y=9 at turn 25+H-1? \n   Actually, the sequence is from t=0 to H-1, meaning we do H actions. The initial state is at turn t1=25, and then we do an action at 25, then 26, ... until we have done H actions. Then the final turn is 25+H-1? \n\n   Let me clarify: \n        At the beginning of turn t1 (25), we are at (0,5). Then we choose an action a_{25}. \n        Then at turn 26, we are at the new y.\n\n        We do H actions: at turns 25, 26, ..., 25+H-1. Then the last action is at 25+H-1, and then we are at the state at turn 25+H.\n\n        We require that at turn 25+H, we are at y=9? \n\n        But note: the problem says \"reach (0,9)\" at turn t1+H-1? \n\n        Actually, the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning t from 0 to H-1, so the actions are at t1+0, t1+1, ... t1+H-1. Then the state after the last action is at turn t1+H.\n\n        And we require that at turn t1+H, the player is at (0,9). But note that the goal is to be at (0,9) at the end. However, the problem says: \"reach (0,9)\" at the turn after the last action? \n\n        Actually, the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions ... to reach (0,9)\".\n\n        But note: the player update: after an action at turn t, we get the state at turn t+1.\n\n        So after H actions (the last at turn t1+H-1), the state at turn t1+H is the final state. Therefore, we require y_{t1+H} = 9.\n\n        Therefore, H is the number of actions, and the total turns taken is H (from turn t1 to turn t1+H-1 for actions, and the result is at turn t1+H).\n\n        However, the minimal H: we want the smallest H such that we can get to y=9 at turn t1+H.\n\n        But note: we start at turn t1=25 at y=5. Without any obstacles, the minimal H would be 4: because we can do U four times: \n            turn25: U -> y6 at turn26\n            turn26: U -> y7 at turn27\n            turn27: U -> y8 at turn28\n            turn28: U -> y9 at turn29\n            So H=4, and we reach at turn29.\n\n        But we have to avoid cars on freeways 1 to 8. So we must not be on a freeway when a car covers x=0 at that turn.\n\n        We are at y=5 at turn25. Then we are about to take an action. At turn25, we are on freeway5? \n            But note: we start at turn25 at (0,5). Then we are on freeway5 at turn25. So we must check freeway5 at turn25.\n\n        Let's check freeway5 at turn25: \n            Cars: (12,1,right,6), (-24,-35,right,6), (54,43,right,6)\n\n            For the first car: right-moving, so tail_25 = 1 + 6*(25-25)=1, head_25=12+0=12 -> [1,12] -> 0 is not in [1,12] -> safe.\n            Second car: tail_25=-35+0=-35, head_25=-24 -> [-35,-24] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n            Third car: tail_25=43+0=43, head_25=54 -> [43,54] -> safe.\n\n        So freeway5 at turn25 is safe.\n\n        Then we can take an action at turn25. \n\n        We need to plan for the next turns.\n\n Approach:\n\n Since H is small (at least 4, but might be more due to detours) and the grid is small (y from 0 to 9), we can use BFS.\n\n State: (turn, y) \n   turn: starting at 25 and going up. But note that the car positions change with time.\n\n We are going to consider states (t, y) where t is the current turn (the state at the beginning of turn t, meaning we are at (0,y) at turn t). Then we choose an action a_t that leads to state (t+1, y') where y' = y + dy.\n\n We want to reach (t, 9) for some t>=25+? But note: once we are at (t,9), we are done. However, we must have taken the actions from 25 to t-1? \n\n   Actually, the state at turn t is the result after the action at turn t-1. So we start at (25,5). Then we take an action at turn25 to get to turn26 at y6, etc.\n\n   So we are looking for the smallest t such that we can be at (t,9) without having collided at any turn from 25 to t-1? \n\n   But note: at each turn τ (from 25 to t-1), we were at some y_τ and we must check that at that turn τ, we were not colliding with a car on freeway y_τ.\n\n   How to check collision at a state (τ, y): \n        If y is 0 or 9, then no car -> safe.\n        If y is between 1 and 8, then we look at the freeway y at turn τ. For each car on that freeway, compute its span at turn τ. If any car's span contains 0, then collision.\n\n   We can precompute for each freeway k (1..8) and for each turn τ (from 25 up to a limit) whether the freeway k is safe at turn τ.\n\n   What limit? We know that without obstacles we can get to 9 in 4 moves (so by turn29). But we might have to wait, so we might need more turns. Let's set a limit: say up to 50 turns? \n\n   Alternatively, we can compute the safety for each freeway for the necessary turns as we do BFS.\n\n   Steps:\n\n   Precomputation: For each freeway k (1..8) and for each turn τ in a range [25, 25+max_depth] (max_depth we set to 20, so τ from 25 to 45), compute if there is any car on freeway k that has 0 in its span at turn τ.\n\n   How to compute for a car on freeway k at turn τ?\n\n        For a car (h, τ0, d, s) given at turn t1=25:\n\n        At turn τ, the time elapsed is (τ - 25).\n\n        If the car is right-moving:\n            tail_τ = τ0 + s*(τ-25)\n            head_τ = h + s*(τ-25)\n            Then check if 0 is in [tail_τ, head_τ]? That is, tail_τ <= 0 <= head_τ.\n\n        Since all cars are right-moving, we only do that.\n\n   Note: the input for a car uses (head, tail) but the update for right uses tail and head? Actually, the input says (head, tail, ...) but for a right-moving car, the head is the larger coordinate. So the update rule for right is:\n\n        tail_τ = (the tail at t1) + s*(τ-25)   [the tail at t1 is the second number?]\n\n        head_τ = (the head at t1) + s*(τ-25)   [the head at t1 is the first number]\n\n        Then the span is [tail_τ, head_τ]? \n\n        But note: the input for freeway5: \n            (12,1,right,6) -> head_t1=12, tail_t1=1 -> so at τ, tail_τ = 1 + 6*(τ-25), head_τ = 12 + 6*(τ-25). \n            Then the car covers [1+6*(τ-25), 12+6*(τ-25)].\n\n        Similarly, the second car: (-24,-35,right,6) -> tail_τ = -35 + 6*(τ-25), head_τ = -24 + 6*(τ-25)\n\n        Third car: (54,43,right,6) -> tail_τ = 43 + 6*(τ-25), head_τ = 54 + 6*(τ-25)\n\n   Now, we can precompute for each freeway k and each turn τ (from 25 to 45) the safety.\n\n   However, note: freeway5 has three cars. We must check if any of the three cars covers 0 at turn τ.\n\n   Similarly, freeway6 has the same three cars? \n        Freeway6: same as freeway5: (12,1,right,6), (-24,-35,right,6), (54,43,right,6)\n\n   Freeway1: one car: (-24,-47,right,24) -> \n        tail_τ = -47 + 24*(τ-25)\n        head_τ = -24 + 24*(τ-25)\n\n        We need: -47+24*(τ-25) <= 0 <= -24+24*(τ-25)\n\n        Solve: \n            Lower bound: -47+24*(τ-25) <= 0  => 24*(τ-25) <= 47 => τ-25 <= 47/24 ≈ 1.95 -> τ <= 26.95 -> so τ=26 and 27? \n            Upper bound: 0 <= -24+24*(τ-25) => 24*(τ-25) >= 24 => τ-25>=1 -> τ>=26.\n\n        So at τ=26: \n            tail_26 = -47+24= -23, head_26=-24+24=0 -> [-23,0] -> 0 is included? yes, because the car covers from -23 to 0.

We are starting at y5. \n\n        How about going up to y9 as quickly as possible without stepping on unsafe freeways at the wrong time?\n\n        We know we must avoid freeway8 until τ>=31. So the earliest we can be on freeway8 is τ=31. \n\n        Then the earliest we can be at y9 is turn32: \n            because: we must be at y8 at turn31? then at turn31 we do U to be at y9 at turn32.\n\n        How to get to y8 at turn31?\n\n        We start at y5 at turn25. We have 6 turns (25 to 30) to get from y5 to y8? But note: we have to move 3 steps up (from 5 to 8) so we need at least 3 moves up. \n\n        We can also move down and then up? But that might take more moves.\n\n        The minimal moves is 3 moves up. But we have 6 turns (from turn25 to turn30) to use 3 moves? We can use the other 3 moves to wait (S) or detour? \n\n        We must avoid:\n\n            - At turn26: freeway1,2,3,4 are unsafe -> so we must not be on freeway1,2,3,4 at turn26. \n            - At turn28: freeway7 and freeway8 are unsafe -> so we must not be on freeway7 or 8 at turn28.\n            - At turn29: freeway5,6,8 are unsafe -> avoid 5,6,8 at turn29.\n            - At turn30: freeway5,6,8 are unsafe.\n\n        We are at y5 at turn25 (safe).\n\n        We want to be at y8 at turn31.\n\n        We have 6 steps (turn25 to turn30) to get from y5 to y8, which is 3 steps up. So we can do 3 Ups and 3 Stays? \n\n        How about: \n            turn25: S -> y5 at26: but at turn26, freeway5 is safe, so safe.\n            turn26: S -> y5 at27: safe.\n            turn27: U -> y6 at28: freeway6 at τ=28: safe -> safe.\n            turn28: U -> y7 at29: freeway7 at τ=29: safe -> safe.\n            turn29: U -> y8 at30: freeway8 at τ=30: unsafe -> crash.\n\n        Not safe.\n\n        How about:\n\n            turn25: U -> y6 at26: safe (freeway6 at26 safe)\n            turn26: S -> y6 at27: safe.\n            turn27: S -> y6 at28: safe (freeway6 at28 safe)\n            turn28: U -> y7 at29: safe (freeway7 at29 safe)\n            turn29: U -> y8 at30: unsafe (freeway8 at30 unsafe)\n\n        Still not.\n\n        We must avoid being on freeway8 until τ=31. So we cannot be on freeway8 at turn30. Therefore, we must be at y7 at turn30, and then at turn30 we do U to go to y8 at turn31.\n\n        So we require:\n            At turn30: we must be at y7 (so that we are safe at freeway7 at τ=30? freeway7 at τ=30: \n                car: [-47+12*5=-47+60=13, -36+60=24] -> safe) \n            Then at turn30: we do U -> then at turn31 we are at y8: freeway8 at τ=31: safe.\n\n        Then we do one more U at turn31 to get to y9 at turn32.\n\n        So the plan:\n\n            We need to be at y7 at turn30.\n\n            How to get from y5 at turn25 to y7 at turn30? \n\n                We have 5 moves (from turn25 to turn29) to go from y5 to y7: that's 2 steps up. So we need at least 2 moves of U. The rest can be S or D.\n\n            We also have constraints at each turn.\n\n            Steps:\n\n                turn25: we start at y5.\n\n                We consider:\n\n                    Option A: \n                        turn25: U -> y6 at26: safe.\n                        turn26: ? \n                            We cannot be on freeway1-4 at26 -> so we must avoid going down to 4 or below? \n                            We are at y6 -> safe.\n\n                        turn26: S -> y6 at27: safe.\n                        turn27: S -> y6 at28: safe.\n                        turn28: U -> y7 at29: safe.\n                        turn29: S -> y7 at30: safe. -> then at turn30: we are at y7.\n\n                Then:\n                    turn30: U -> y8 at31: freeway8 at τ=31: safe.\n                    turn31: U -> y9 at32.\n\n                Total moves: 7 (from turn25 to turn31: 7 actions) -> H=7.\n\n            Is there a way with 6 moves? \n\n            We need to be at y7 at turn30. We start at y5 at turn25. We have 5 moves (turn25 to turn29) to get to y7. \n\n            The minimal moves to go from y5 to y7 is 2 moves (two Ups). So we can do two Ups and three S. \n\n            But we must not be on an unsafe freeway at any turn from 25 to 30 (for the state at that turn).\n\n            The above option A uses: \n                turn25: U (to y6) -> safe\n                turn26: S (y6) -> safe\n                turn27: S (y6) -> safe\n                turn28: U (to y7) -> safe\n                turn29: S (y7) -> safe\n\n            Then we do two more moves at turn30 and turn31.\n\n            Total H=7.\n\n            Alternatively, can we do without the extra S at turn29? \n\n            We need to be at y7 at turn30. We can be at y7 at turn29 and then stay at turn29? \n\n                turn25: U -> y6 at26 (safe)\n                turn26: S -> y6 at27 (safe)\n                turn27: U -> y7 at28: unsafe!

Then we must avoid freeway7 at τ=28? \n                    turn27: S -> y7 at28: unsafe (freeway7 at τ=28: unsafe) -> crash.\n\n                turn27: D -> y6 at28: safe (freeway6 at28: safe)\n                turn28: S -> y6 at29: unsafe? freeway6 at τ=29: unsafe (because of car2: [-11,0]) -> crash.\n\n            So we must avoid being at freeway6 at τ=29? \n\n            How about:\n\n                turn25: S -> y5 at26 (safe)\n                turn26: U -> y6 at27 (safe)\n                turn27: S -> y6 at28 (safe)\n                turn28: U -> y7 at29 (safe) -> then at turn29: y7 (safe)\n                turn29: S -> y7 at30 (safe) -> then we can do U at30 to y8 at31.\n\n            This is the same as option A but starting with S instead of U at turn25. It also takes 5 moves to get to y7 at turn30? \n                turn25: S -> y5 at26\n                turn26: U -> y6 at27\n                turn27: S -> y6 at28\n                turn28: U -> y7 at29\n                turn29: S -> y7 at30\n            Then turn30: U -> y8 at31\n            turn31: U -> y9 at32 -> total 7 moves.\n\n            But note: we are at y5 at turn25. We do nothing at turn25? and then we do an U at turn26. \n\n            Alternatively, we might do:\n\n                turn25: U -> y6 at26\n                turn26: S -> y6 at27\n                turn27: U -> y7 at28: unsafe -> not allowed.\n\n            So we must not go to y7 at turn28.\n\n        Therefore, the minimal H is 7.\n\n        The sequence:\n\n            turn25: U\n            turn26: S\n            turn27: S\n            turn28: U\n            turn29: S\n            turn30: U\n            turn31: U\n\n        Let's verify:\n\n            Start: turn25, y5 -> safe.\n            Action at turn25: U -> then at turn26: y6 -> check freeway6 at τ=26: safe?

We have 4 moves (turn25 to turn28) to get to y8 (which is 3 steps up). So we can do 3 Ups and 1 S.\n\n                Example:\n\n                    turn25: U -> y6 at26 (safe)\n                    turn26: U -> y7 at27 (safe)\n                    turn27: U -> y8 at28: unsafe! (freeway8 at τ=28: unsafe) -> crash.\n\n                Or:\n\n                    turn25: S -> y5 at26 (safe)\n                    turn26: U -> y6 at27 (safe)\n                    turn27: U -> y7 at28: unsafe (freeway7 at τ=28: unsafe) -> crash.\n\n                Or:\n\n                    turn25: U -> y6 at26 (safe)\n                    turn26: S -> y6 at27 (safe)\n                    turn27: U -> y7 at28: unsafe -> crash.\n\n                Or:\n\n                    turn25: U -> y6 at26 (safe)\n                    turn26: D -> y5 at27 (safe)\n                    turn27: U -> y6 at28 (safe) [freeway6 at28: safe]\n                    turn28: U -> y7 at29 (safe) \n                    then we are at y7 at29, not y8.\n\n                So we cannot get to y8 at turn29.\n\n            Therefore, H=6 is impossible.\n\n        So minimal H is 7.\n\n        The sequence: \n            turn25: U\n            turn26: S\n            turn27: S\n            turn28: U\n            turn29: S\n            turn30: U\n            turn31: U\n\n        But wait: we have 7 actions? Then the last action is at turn31, and we are at y9 at turn32.\n\n        However, the problem asks for the minimal number of turns H, and the sequence of actions from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\n        H is the number of actions? The problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\", and the sequence is {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}.\n\n        So H=7.\n\n        Answer format:\n\n            Turn 25: U\n            Turn 26: S\n            Turn 27: S\n            Turn 28: U\n            Turn 29: S\n            Turn 30: U\n            Turn 31: U\n\n        But note: the last action (at turn31) moves us to y9 at turn32. The problem says \"reach (0,9)\" at the state after the last action, which is turn32. And we did 7 actions.\n\n        Alternatively, we can consider if we can do without the last U? \n\n        We are at y8 at turn31. We need to be at y9. So we must do the last U.\n\n        Therefore, we output:\n\n            Turn 25: U\n            Turn 26: S\n            Turn 27: S\n            Turn 28: U\n            Turn 29: S\n            Turn 30: U\n            Turn 31: U\n\n        However, note: we have an alternative that uses 7 moves but with a different sequence? \n\n        But we found one that works.\n\n        Let me check if we can avoid the S at turn29? \n\n        We must be at y7 at turn30. We can get to y7 at turn30 without the S at turn29? \n\n            We are at y7 at turn29 (from turn28: U). Then at turn29 we can do something else? \n\n            If we do U at turn29: then we go to y8 at turn30. But freeway8 at turn30 is unsafe -> crash.\n\n            So we must do S at turn29 to stay at y7 at turn30.\n\n        Therefore, the sequence above is the minimal.\n\n        But note: we could do D at turn29? then we go to y6 at turn30: but freeway6 at turn30 is unsafe -> crash.\n\n        So only S is safe.\n\n        Thus, we output the sequence.\n\n        However, note that we might have a sequence that uses more downs and then come up later? but that would take more moves.\n\n        So we are confident.\n\n        Let me write the answer.\n\n        Note: the initial turn is t1=25.\n\n        Answer:\n\n            Turn 25: U\n            Turn 26: S\n            Turn 27: S\n            Turn 28: U\n            Turn 29: S\n            Turn 30: U\n            Turn 31: U\n\n        But wait: we have 7 moves, but the last action is at turn31 (which is t1+6). \n\n        The sequence: \n            t1+0 -> 25: U\n            t1+1 -> 26: S\n            t1+2 -> 27: S\n            t1+3 -> 28: U\n            t1+4 -> 29: S\n            t1+5 -> 30: U\n            t1+6 -> 31: U\n\n        So H=7.\n\n        We box the answer.\n\n        However, note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\" and then the sequence. We have H=7.\n\n        But the problem also says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\". So t from 0 to 6 (7 actions).\n\n        We write:\n\n            Turn 25: U\n            Turn 26: S\n            Turn 27: S\n            Turn 28: U\n            Turn 29: S\n            Turn 30: U\n            Turn 31: U\n\n        But the turn labels: \n            The first action is at turn25, then turn26, ... turn31.\n\n        This is correct.\n\n        Let me double-check the safety at each step:\n\n            Turn25: start at (0,5) -> safe (we checked freeway5 at25: safe)\n            After action U at25: at turn26, we are at (0,6) -> freeway6 at26: \n                car1: [1+6*1=7, 12+6=18] -> 0 not in -> safe\n                car2: [-35+6=-29, -24+6=-18] -> safe\n                car3: [43+6=49,54+6=60] -> safe -> safe.\n\n            Action S at26: at turn27, we are at (0,6) -> freeway6 at27:\n                car1: [1+12=13,12+12=24] -> safe\n                car2: [-35+12=-23, -24+12=-12] -> safe\n                car3: [43+12=55,54+12=66] -> safe -> safe.\n\n            Action S at27: at turn28, we are at (0,6) -> freeway6 at28:\n                car1: [1+18=19,12+18=30] -> safe\n                car2: [-35+18=-17, -24+18=-6] -> safe\n                car3: [43+18=61,54+18=72] -> safe -> safe.\n\n            Action U at28: at turn29, we are at (0,7) -> freeway7 at29:\n                car: [-47+12*4= -47+48=1, -36+48=12] -> safe? 0 not in [1,12] -> safe.\n\n            Action S at29: at turn30, we are at (0,7) -> freeway7 at30:\n                car: [-47+12*5= -47+60=13, -36+60=24] -> safe.\n\n            Action U at30: at turn31, we are at (0,8) -> freeway8 at31:\n                car: [-23+4*6= -23+24=1, -12+24=12] -> safe.\n\n            Action U at31: at turn32, we are at (0,9) -> goal.\n\n        Perfect.\n\n        Therefore, the answer is:\n\n            Turn 25: U\n            Turn 26: S\n            Turn 27: S\n            Turn 28: U\n            Turn 29: S\n            Turn 30: U\n            Turn 31: U\n\n        We write it in the boxed format.\n\n        Note: the problem says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" meaning the first action at turn25.\n\n        So:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 25: U \\\\\nTurn 26: S \\\\\nTurn 27: S \\\\\nTurn 28: U \\\\\nTurn 29: S \\\\\nTurn 30: U \\\\\nTurn 31: U\n}\n\n        But wait, the problem says \"a_{t1+t}\" for t=0 to H-1. So we have t from 0 to 6 (7 terms). And we have listed the actions for turns 25 to 31.\n\n        This matches.\n\n        We are done.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 5)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 25\\) is 7.

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 26, and the player is at (0,6). The goal is to reach (0,9) in minimal turns H, avoiding collisions.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S) each turn, changing the y-coordinate by +1, -1, or 0, respectively. The y-coordinate is bounded between 0 and 9.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if the player is on a freeway y (where y from 1 to 8) and at that turn, the x=0 is within the span of any car on that freeway.\n\nImportant: At turn T, if the player moves to a new freeway (i.e., y_{T+1} != y_T), then at turn T the player is still on the old freeway (y_T) and at turn T+1 the player is on the new freeway (y_{T+1}). So, when moving, the player is only at one freeway per turn.\n\nThe car update: \nFor a car on a freeway, at turn t1 (current turn) we have its head and tail. The direction and speed are given. For a right-moving car, the entire car moves to the right (positive x direction) at speed s per turn. Similarly, left-moving moves to the left.\n\nBut note: the representation for right-moving: the car is given as (head, tail) but note that for right-moving, the head is the front (which is at a higher x) and tail at lower. However, the update rule says:\n  Right-moving: Span(t1) = [tau, h] -> at turn T: [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\nBut wait, the table gives (head, tail) and then direction. Let me check the example:\n\nFor freeway 1: (0, -23, right, 24) -> so head=0, tail=-23? Then according to the rule, for right-moving the span at t1 is [tau, h] = [-23, 0]. Then at a future turn T, it becomes [-23 + 24*(T-26), 0 + 24*(T-26)].\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving we would have: [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)].\n\nBut note: the problem says for left-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, tau] -> [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\". So the initial span is [h, tau] meaning from h to tau? But note that for left-moving, the head is the front (which is at a higher x) and as it moves left, the head moves left. However, in the representation, we are given (head, tail) and direction.\n\nBut in the table, all the cars in the given state are right-moving? Let me check:\n\nFreeway 1: right\nFreeway 2: right\nFreeway 3: right\nFreeway 4: right\nFreeway 5: three cars, all right\nFreeway 6: three cars, all right\nFreeway 7: right\nFreeway 8: right\n\nSo all cars are right-moving. Therefore, for every car, the span at turn t1 is [tail, head] (because for right-moving, the tail is the leftmost and head the rightmost). But wait, the table gives (head, tail) and then direction. So for a right-moving car, the head is the rightmost and tail the leftmost. Therefore, the span is [tail, head]. \n\nHowever, in the update rule for right-moving, it says: \n  Span(T) = [tau + s*(T-t1), head + s*(T-t1)]\n\nSo for freeway 1 at t1=26: \n  tail = -23, head = 0, speed=24.\n  So at turn T, the car spans [ -23 + 24*(T-26), 0 + 24*(T-26) ].\n\nWe care about when x=0 is in that span. So we need:\n  -23 + 24*(T-26) <= 0 <= 0 + 24*(T-26)\n\nSimplify:\n  Lower bound: L(T) = -23 + 24*(T-26)\n  Upper bound: U(T) = 0 + 24*(T-26)\n\nWe require L(T) <= 0 <= U(T)\n\nBut note: the car is moving right, so at T=26, L(26) = -23, U(26)=0 -> so 0 is in [-23,0] -> so at turn 26, the car covers x=0? But the player is at freeway 6 at turn 26? Actually, the player is at (0,6) at turn 26. We must check if at turn 26, on freeway 6, is there a car that covers x=0? \n\nBut note: the player is at freeway 6 at turn 26. We must check the cars on freeway 6 at turn 26.\n\nHowever, the problem says: collision occurs at turn T only if the player is on freeway y_T and at that turn, 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway.\n\nSo for each freeway we are on at a given turn, we must check the cars on that freeway at that turn.\n\nBut note: the player starts at y=6 at turn 26. So we must check freeway 6 at turn 26.\n\nFreeway 6 has three cars: \n  (18,7,right,6), (-18,-29,right,6), (60,49,right,6)\n\nWait, the representation is (head, tail, direction, speed). For right-moving, the span is [tail, head]. So:\n\nCar1: tail=7, head=18? But wait, that would be [7,18] -> but 0 is not in [7,18]. \nActually, the problem says: for right-moving, the car is given as (head, tail) and then the span is [tail, head]? But note the update rule uses [tau, h] for right-moving. So yes, the span is [tail, head]. \n\nBut wait: the first car on freeway 6: head=18, tail=7 -> then the car spans [7,18]. So at x=0? not covered.\n\nSecond car: head=-18, tail=-29 -> span [-29, -18] -> 0 not in.\n\nThird car: head=60, tail=49 -> [49,60] -> 0 not in.\n\nSo at turn 26, freeway 6 is safe.\n\nNow, we need to plan a sequence of moves to get to y=9 as quickly as possible, avoiding collisions.\n\nThe minimal moves in terms of vertical steps: we are at y=6, we need to go to y=9 -> at least 3 steps up. But we might have to wait (stay) to avoid cars, so H might be more than 3.\n\nWe are going to simulate turns starting from turn 26. We are at y=6 at turn 26.\n\nWe need to check for each future turn T (starting at T=26) and for each freeway we might be on at that turn, whether there is a car on that freeway at turn T that covers x=0.\n\nSince the cars are moving, we have to compute for each freeway and each car on that freeway, the time intervals (if any) when the car covers x=0.\n\nBut note: the cars are moving at constant speed. For a right-moving car on freeway i, with initial (at t1=26) tail = t0, head = h0, speed = s, then at turn T, the car is at [t0 + s*(T-26), h0 + s*(T-26)].\n\nWe require that 0 is in [t0 + s*(T-26), h0 + s*(T-26)]:\n\n  t0 + s*(T-26) <= 0 <= h0 + s*(T-26)\n\n=>\n\n  (T-26) >= (0 - h0)/s   and   (T-26) <= (0 - t0)/s   ??? Let me rearrange:\n\nThe condition is:\n  t0 + s*(T-26) <= 0   =>   s*(T-26) <= -t0   =>   T-26 >= ceil( (-t0) / s )? Not exactly, because we are in real numbers? But T is integer.\n\nActually, we have two inequalities:\n\n1. t0 + s*(T-26) <= 0   =>   T-26 <= (-t0)/s   [if s>0, then inequality direction remains]\n2. 0 <= h0 + s*(T-26)   =>   T-26 >= (-h0)/s\n\nBut note: for a right-moving car, we have t0 (tail) is less than h0 (head). So the car covers a contiguous segment. Also, the car is moving to the right, so the entire segment shifts right.\n\nWe can write:\n\n  L(T) = t0 + s*(T-26)\n  U(T) = h0 + s*(T-26)\n\nThen we require L(T) <= 0 <= U(T).\n\nSo the condition is:\n  L(T) <= 0  =>  T <= ( -t0 ) / s + 26   [if s>0]\n  U(T) >= 0  =>  T >= ( -h0 ) / s + 26\n\nBut note: since the car moves right, as T increases, L(T) and U(T) increase. So the interval of T when the car covers 0 is:\n\n  T_min = ceil( ( -h0 ) / s + 26 )   ??? Actually:\n\nFrom U(T) >= 0: \n  h0 + s*(T-26) >= 0\n  => s*(T-26) >= -h0\n  => T-26 >= ceil( (-h0) / s )   if we are to take the smallest integer T? But note: if (-h0)/s is integer, then T-26 must be at least (-h0)/s. If not, then we take the ceiling.\n\nSimilarly, from L(T) <= 0:\n  t0 + s*(T-26) <= 0\n  => s*(T-26) <= -t0\n  => T-26 <= floor( (-t0) / s )   ? Because if we take T-26 = floor( (-t0)/s ), then L(T) = t0 + s*floor(...) <= 0? \n\nBut note: the inequalities are linear. We can compute the exact interval of T (real) and then take integer T in that interval.\n\nBut since T is integer, the dangerous T are the integers in the interval [ T_low, T_high ] where:\n\n  T_low = ceil( 26 + (-h0)/s )   [because for T >= 26 + (-h0)/s, the upper bound is nonnegative? Actually, we need U(T)>=0 -> T>=26+(-h0)/s? And since T is integer, we take ceil?]\n\nActually, the real interval for T is:\n  T >= 26 - h0/s\n  T <= 26 - t0/s\n\nSo the integer T in [ ceil(26 - h0/s), floor(26 - t0/s) ]\n\nBut note: if 26 - h0/s is integer, then ceil(26 - h0/s) = 26 - h0/s.\n\nSimilarly, if 26 - t0/s is integer, then floor(26 - t0/s) = 26 - t0/s.\n\nSo for each car, we can compute the set of turns T (integer) for which 0 is in the car's span.\n\nWe must avoid being on the freeway of that car at that turn.\n\nNow, we are going to list for each freeway (1 to 8) the dangerous time intervals (if any) when a car on that freeway covers x=0.\n\nWe'll do this for each car on each freeway.\n\nFreeway 1:\n  Car: (head=0, tail=-23, right, speed=24)\n  Dangerous T: \n      T >= 26 - 0/24 = 26\n      T <= 26 - (-23)/24 = 26 + 23/24 ≈ 26.958 -> so T<=26.958\n      So T in [26, 26.958] -> only T=26.\n\nAt turn 26, this car is at [ -23 + 24*(0), 0+24*(0) ] = [-23,0] -> and 0 is included.\n\nSo freeway 1 is dangerous at turn 26? But we are at freeway 6 at turn 26, so we don't care. However, if we are on freeway 1 at turn 26, it would be dangerous.\n\nBut note: the player is at freeway 6 at turn 26. So freeway 1 at turn 26 is dangerous, but we are not there.\n\nFreeway 2:\n  Car: (head=24, tail=-11, right, speed=36)\n  Dangerous T:\n      T >= 26 - 24/36 = 26 - 2/3 ≈ 25.333 -> so T>=26? (since T is integer, and 25.333 -> ceil(25.333)=26? Actually, we are computing for T>=26? The game starts at turn 26. But we can look at T>=26.\n      T <= 26 - (-11)/36 = 26 + 11/36 ≈ 26.305 -> so T<=26.305 -> only T=26.\n\nFreeway 3: same as freeway 2? \n  The table says: freeway 2 and 3 have the same car: (24,-11,right,36). So same as freeway 2: dangerous at T=26.\n\nFreeway 4: same as freeway 2 and 3: dangerous at T=26.\n\nFreeway 5: \n  Three cars:\n  Car1: (head=18, tail=7, right, speed=6)\n      Dangerous T: \n          T>=26 - 18/6 = 26 - 3 = 23\n          T<=26 - 7/6 = 26 - 1.1666 = 24.833\n          So T in [23, 24.833] -> T=23,24? But we start at T=26 -> no danger at T>=26.\n\n  Car2: (head=-18, tail=-29, right, speed=6)\n      T>=26 - (-18)/6 = 26 + 3 = 29\n      T<=26 - (-29)/6 = 26 + 29/6 ≈ 26 + 4.833 = 30.833\n      So T in [29, 30.833] -> T=29,30.\n\n  Car3: (head=60, tail=49, right, speed=6)\n      T>=26 - 60/6 = 26-10=16\n      T<=26 - 49/6 ≈ 26 - 8.166 = 17.833 -> T=16,17.\n\n  So for freeway 5, the dangerous turns are T=29 and T=30 (from car2). The other cars are not dangerous at T>=26.\n\nFreeway 6: \n  Same three cars as freeway5: \n      Car1: (18,7,right,6): dangerous T: 23,24 -> not in [26, ...]\n      Car2: (-18,-29,right,6): dangerous T: 29,30\n      Car3: (60,49,right,6): dangerous T: 16,17 -> not in [26,...]\n  So freeway6 is dangerous at T=29 and T=30.\n\nFreeway 7:\n  Car: (head=-24, tail=-35, right, speed=12)\n      Dangerous T:\n          T>=26 - (-24)/12 = 26 + 2 = 28\n          T<=26 - (-35)/12 ≈ 26 + 2.9166 = 28.9166\n          So T=28.\n\nFreeway 8:\n  Car: (head=-8, tail=-19, right, speed=4)\n      Dangerous T:\n          T>=26 - (-8)/4 = 26+2 = 28\n          T<=26 - (-19)/4 = 26 + 19/4 = 26+4.75 = 30.75\n          So T in [28, 30.75] -> T=28,29,30.\n\nSummary of dangerous turns for each freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: T=26\nFreeway 2: T=26\nFreeway 3: T=26\nFreeway 4: T=26\nFreeway 5: T=29,30\nFreeway 6: T=29,30\nFreeway 7: T=28\nFreeway 8: T=28,29,30\n\nNote: freeways 0 and 9 are safe (no cars) because cars are only on freeways 1-8.\n\nWe start at turn 26 at y=6 (freeway6). At turn 26, freeway6 is safe? But from above, freeway6 is dangerous at T=29,30. At T=26, freeway6 is safe.\n\nWe need to get to y=9. The minimal path would be to go up 3 times: U, U, U. That would take 3 turns: \n  Turn26: at y=6 -> action U -> turn27: y=7\n  Turn27: at y=7 -> action U -> turn28: y=8\n  Turn28: at y=8 -> action U -> turn29: y=9 -> done? H=3.\n\nBut we must check collisions at each turn:\n\nAt turn26: we are at y=6 -> safe (as above).\nAt turn27: we are at y=7 -> check freeway7 at turn27: \n  Freeway7 dangerous at T=28? At turn27, is freeway7 safe?\n  We computed for freeway7: dangerous at T=28. So at turn27, freeway7 is safe? \n\nBut we need to compute the car on freeway7 at turn27: \n  At turn26: head=-24, tail=-35, speed=12 -> right-moving.\n  At turn27: T-26=1 -> \n      tail: -35 + 12*1 = -23\n      head: -24 + 12*1 = -12\n      So the car is at [-23, -12] -> does not cover 0. So safe.\n\nAt turn28: we would be at y=8. Check freeway8 at turn28: \n  Freeway8: car (head=-8, tail=-19, speed=4) at turn26.\n  At turn28: T-26=2 -> \n      tail: -19 + 4*2 = -19+8 = -11\n      head: -8 + 4*2 = 0\n      So the car is at [-11,0] -> covers 0? because 0 is the head? \n      The span is [tail, head] = [-11,0] -> 0 is included. So freeway8 at turn28 is dangerous.\n\nTherefore, if we go up to y=8 at turn28, we crash.\n\nSo the plan U,U,U is not safe because at turn28 we are at y=8 and that freeway is dangerous.\n\nWe must avoid being at freeway8 at turn28.\n\nWhat if we do U, U, then at turn28 we don't go up? But then we are still at y=8 at turn28, which is dangerous.\n\nWe need to adjust.\n\nAlternative: at turn26: stay? but then we are still at y=6. Then we can go up later. But we are at y=6 at turn26 and then turn27: we can go to y=7 at turn27, then at turn28 we are at y=7 or y=8? \n\nBut freeway7 at turn28 is dangerous? We computed freeway7 dangerous at T=28: \n  At turn28: freeway7 car: \n      tail: -35 + 12*(28-26) = -35+24 = -11\n      head: -24 + 12*2 = 0\n      So car is at [-11,0] -> 0 included. So freeway7 is dangerous at turn28.\n\nSo if we are at freeway7 at turn28, we crash.\n\nTherefore, we cannot be at freeway7 at turn28 and we cannot be at freeway8 at turn28.\n\nWhat about freeway6 at turn28? \n  Freeway6: dangerous at T=29,30 -> at turn28, freeway6 is safe? \n  We compute the cars on freeway6 at turn28:\n\n  Car1: (18,7,6) -> at turn28: T-26=2 -> \n        tail: 7 + 6*2 = 7+12=19\n        head:18+12=30 -> [19,30] -> safe.\n  Car2: (-18,-29,6) -> \n        tail: -29 + 12 = -17\n        head: -18+12=-6 -> [-17,-6] -> safe.\n  Car3: (60,49,6) -> \n        tail:49+12=61\n        head:60+12=72 -> [61,72] -> safe.\n\nSo freeway6 is safe at turn28.\n\nSimilarly, freeway5: at turn28? \n  We computed dangerous at T=29,30 -> so at turn28, safe? \n  Check:\n  Car1: (18,7,6) -> [7+12,18+12]=[19,30] -> safe.\n  Car2: (-18,-29,6) -> [-29+12, -18+12] = [-17,-6] -> safe.\n  Car3: (60,49,6) -> [49+12,60+12]=[61,72] -> safe.\n\nSo freeway5 is safe at turn28.\n\nFreeway4 at turn28? \n  Freeway4: dangerous only at T=26 -> so at turn28, safe? \n  Check: \n      Car: (head=24, tail=-11, speed=36) at turn26.\n      At turn28: T-26=2 -> \n          tail: -11 + 36*2 = -11+72=61\n          head:24+72=96 -> [61,96] -> safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway3,2,1: safe at turn28.\n\nSo at turn28, safe freeways: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,9? But note: we cannot be on freeway7 or 8.\n\nWe are at turn26: y=6. We want to get to y=9.\n\nWe must avoid freeway7 at turn28 and freeway8 at turn28.\n\nIdea: \n  Turn26: at y=6 -> we can do U (to y=7) or S (stay at y=6) or D (to y=5) but going down is away from goal.\n\nIf we do S at turn26: then at turn27 we are at y=6.\n  Then turn27: we can go U to y=7 at turn27 -> then at turn28 we are at y=7? But freeway7 at turn28 is dangerous -> crash.\n\nIf we do U at turn26: then at turn27 we are at y=7.\n  Then at turn27: we can do S (stay at y=7) or D (to y=6) or U (to y=8).\n\n  If we do U at turn27: then at turn28 we are at y=8 -> freeway8 dangerous -> crash.\n\n  If we do S at turn27: then at turn28 we are at y=7 -> freeway7 dangerous -> crash.\n\n  If we do D at turn27: then at turn28 we are at y=6 -> safe (freeway6 safe at turn28).\n\nBut then we are at y=6 at turn28, which is below 9.\n\nThen we need to go up: at turn28: we are at y=6 -> then we can go U to y=7 at turn29.\n\nBut freeway7 at turn29: \n  We computed freeway7 dangerous only at T=28? \n  At turn29: \n      freeway7 car: \n          tail: -35 + 12*(29-26)= -35+36=1\n          head: -24+36=12 -> [1,12] -> does not cover 0? so safe.\n\nBut freeway6 at turn29: dangerous? \n  Freeway6 is dangerous at T=29 and 30. \n  At turn29: \n      Car2: (-18,-29,6) -> at turn29: T-26=3 -> \n          tail: -29+6*3=-29+18=-11\n          head: -18+18=0 -> [-11,0] -> covers 0! So freeway6 is dangerous at turn29.\n\nTherefore, if we are at y=6 at turn29, we crash.\n\nSo we must avoid freeway6 at turn29 and turn30.\n\nSimilarly, freeway5 at turn29: dangerous? \n  Freeway5: dangerous at T=29,30 -> same as freeway6? \n  Check freeway5 car2 at turn29: \n        tail: -29+6*3=-11\n        head: -18+18=0 -> [-11,0] -> dangerous.\n\nSo we cannot be on freeway5 or 6 at turn29 and 30.\n\nBut we are planning to be at y=6 at turn28 and then at turn29 we go to y=7? \n\nAt turn28: we are at y=6 (safe). Then at turn28 we can go to y=7? \n  Then at turn29 we are at y=7.\n\nCheck freeway7 at turn29: \n  We just computed: [1,12] -> safe.\n\nSo if we do:\n\nTurn26: U -> y=7 at turn27\nTurn27: D -> y=6 at turn28   [then at turn28: freeway6 safe? yes, as above]\nTurn28: U -> y=7 at turn29   [then at turn29: freeway7 safe? yes]\n\nThen at turn29: we are at y=7. Then we can go U to y=8 at turn30.\n\nCheck freeway8 at turn30: \n  Freeway8: dangerous at T=28,29,30 -> so at turn30, dangerous? \n  Compute: \n      car: (head=-8, tail=-19, speed=4) at turn26.\n      At turn30: T-26=4 -> \n          tail: -19+4*4 = -19+16=-3\n          head: -8+16=8 -> [-3,8] -> 0 is in [-3,8] -> dangerous.\n\nSo if we go to y=8 at turn30, we crash.\n\nAlternatively, at turn29: from y=7, we can go U to y=8 at turn30? and then we crash.\n\nOr we can stay at y=7 at turn29? then at turn30 we are at y=7.\n\nBut at turn30: freeway7: \n  At turn30: T-26=4 -> \n      tail: -35+12*4=-35+48=13\n      head: -24+48=24 -> [13,24] -> safe.\n\nBut we need to get to y=9.\n\nSo at turn30: we are at y=7. Then we can go U to y=8 at turn31.\n\nBut freeway8 at turn31: \n  At turn31: T-26=5 -> \n      tail: -19+4*5=-19+20=1\n      head: -8+20=12 -> [1,12] -> safe.\n\nThen at turn31: we are at y=8. Then we can go U to y=9 at turn32.\n\nCheck freeway8 at turn31: safe, as above.\nAt turn32: we are at y=9 -> goal.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nTurn26: U -> from y=6 to y=7 at turn27\nTurn27: D -> from y=7 to y=6 at turn28\nTurn28: U -> from y=6 to y=7 at turn29\nTurn29: S (or wait) -> stay at y=7 at turn30? \nBut wait, we want to minimize H. We have to go up eventually.\n\nAlternatively, from turn29: we are at y=7. We can go up to y=8 at turn30? but freeway8 at turn30 is dangerous.\n\nSo we must avoid freeway8 at turn30. Therefore, we have to wait at turn29 and then go at turn31.\n\nBut note: we can also consider going to y=8 at turn29? \n  At turn29: if we are at y=8, then freeway8 at turn29: \n      At turn29: T-26=3 -> \n          tail: -19+4*3=-19+12=-7\n          head: -8+12=4 -> [-7,4] -> 0 is in there -> dangerous.\n\nSo we cannot be at freeway8 at turn29 either.\n\nTherefore, we must avoid freeway8 until turn31.\n\nSo the plan:\n\nTurn26: U -> y=7 at turn27\nTurn27: D -> y=6 at turn28\nTurn28: U -> y=7 at turn29\nTurn29: S -> y=7 at turn30   (avoiding freeway8 at turn30 by not going to 8 and also avoiding freeway5,6 by not being there)\nTurn30: U -> y=8 at turn31   (freeway8 at turn31 is safe: [1,12] -> wait, we computed [1,12] at turn31? \n      Actually, for freeway8 at turn31: \n          tail: -19+4*(31-26)= -19+20=1\n          head: -8+20=12 -> [1,12] -> 0 not in -> safe? \n      But 0 is not in [1,12] -> safe.\n\nThen turn31: U -> y=9 at turn32.\n\nSo H=7? from turn26 to turn32? \n  Turn26: action a_26\n  Turn27: a_27\n  Turn28: a_28\n  Turn29: a_29\n  Turn30: a_30\n  Turn31: a_31 -> then at turn32 we are at y=9.\n\nBut we have 6 actions? from t=26 to t=31 (6 turns: 26,27,28,29,30,31) and then at turn32 we are at y=9. \n\nThe problem: we start at turn26 at y=6. We do an action at turn26, then turn27, ... until the action at turn26+H-1 that leads to y=9 at the next state? \n\nThe state after an action: \n  At turn t, we are at y_t, then we choose a_t, then at turn t+1, we are at y_{t+1} = y_t + delta.\n\nWe want that at turn t1+H-1 (the last action) we end up at y_{t1+H} = 9.\n\nIn the sequence above:\n  Start: t=26, y=6.\n  t=26: a_26=U -> t=27: y=7\n  t=27: a_27=D -> t=28: y=6\n  t=28: a_28=U -> t=29: y=7\n  t=29: a_29=S -> t=30: y=7\n  t=30: a_30=U -> t=31: y=8\n  t=31: a_31=U -> t=32: y=9\n\nSo we do actions at turns 26,27,28,29,30,31 -> that's 6 actions. Then at turn32 we are at y=9. So H=6.\n\nBut is there a shorter way?\n\nAlternative: avoid going down? \n\nSuppose we do at turn26: S (stay at y=6) -> then at turn27: y=6.\nThen at turn27: we can go to y=7? \n  Then at turn28: we are at y=7 -> but freeway7 at turn28 is dangerous -> crash.\n\nAt turn26: D to y=5? \n  Then at turn27: y=5. \n  Check freeway5 at turn27: \n      We know freeway5 dangerous at T=29,30 -> so at turn27: safe? \n      Compute: \n        Car1: (18,7,6) at turn26 -> turn27: [7+6,18+6]=[13,24] -> safe.\n        Car2: (-18,-29,6) -> [-29+6, -18+6]=[-23,-12] -> safe.\n        Car3: (60,49,6) -> [49+6,60+6]=[55,66] -> safe.\n\n  Then at turn27: we are at y=5. Then we can go up: \n      turn27: U -> y=6 at turn28 -> freeway6 at turn28: safe (as above)\n      turn28: U -> y=7 at turn29 -> freeway7 at turn29: safe (as above, [1,12] -> no 0)\n      turn29: U -> y=8 at turn30 -> freeway8 at turn30: dangerous -> crash.\n\nSo we crash at turn30.\n\nAlternatively, at turn28: from y=6, we can stay? then at turn29: we are at y=6 -> but freeway6 at turn29 is dangerous.\n\nOr at turn28: go to y=7 at turn29 -> safe (freeway7 at turn29 safe). Then at turn29: we can go to y=8 at turn30 -> freeway8 at turn30 dangerous.\n\nSo we still crash.\n\nWhat if we wait at turn28: stay at y=6? then at turn29: we crash because freeway6 at turn29 is dangerous.\n\nSo the down path doesn't seem to help.\n\nWhat if we go up to y=7 at turn26, then at turn27 we stay? \n  Then at turn28 we are at y=7 -> crash (freeway7 dangerous).\n\nOr at turn27: go to y=8? then at turn28 we are at y=8 -> crash (freeway8 dangerous).\n\nSo we must leave freeway7 and 8 at turn28.\n\nAnother idea: go up to y=8 at turn26? \n  But we start at y=6. We can only move one per turn. So we cannot jump.\n\nWe must go through y=7 to get to y=8.\n\nTherefore, the only safe way we have so far is the one with 6 actions.\n\nBut can we do better?\n\nWhat if we go up to y=7 at turn26, then down to y=6 at turn27, then at turn28 we are at y=6 (safe). Then at turn28 we could go up to y=7 at turn29 (safe). Then at turn29 we go up to y=8 at turn30? but freeway8 at turn30 is dangerous.\n\nBut we can avoid freeway8 at turn30 by not going to y=8 at turn30. Instead, we can go to y=9 at turn30? \n  From y=7 at turn29: we can go U to y=8 at turn30, but then we are at y=8 at turn30 -> crash. \n  Then at turn30 we can go U to y=9 at turn31? but at turn30 we are already at y=8 and then we do U to y=9 at turn31. But at turn30 we are at y=8 and crash.\n\nSo we cannot be at freeway8 at turn30.\n\nBut note: we can skip freeway8? \n  The goal is at y=9, which is above freeway8. We don't need to step on freeway8? \n  Actually, when we are at y=8 and then do U, we go to y=9. But at the moment we are at y=8 (at turn30) we are on freeway8 and we crash.\n\nSo we must avoid being at freeway8 at turn30.\n\nBut we can be at freeway8 at a safe turn. The next safe turn for freeway8 is turn31: \n  At turn31: freeway8: [1,12] -> safe.\n\nSo we have to wait until turn31 to be at freeway8.\n\nTherefore, the plan must have:\n\nAt turn30: we are at y=7 (freeway7, which is safe at turn30: [13,24] -> no 0) and then at turn31 we go to y=8 (freeway8 at turn31: [1,12] -> safe) and then at turn32 we go to y=9.\n\nSo the sequence we have is:\n\nTurn26: U -> y=7\nTurn27: D -> y=6\nTurn28: U -> y=7\nTurn29: S -> y=7   (we are at y=7 at turn30? no: \n        turn29: we start at y=7, do S, then at turn30 we are at y=7.\n        Then turn30: U -> at turn31: y=8\n        Then turn31: U -> at turn32: y=9.\n\nBut we can avoid the stay at turn29? \n\nAfter turn28: we are at y=7 at turn29. Then we can do D? to y=6 at turn30? \n  But freeway6 at turn30: dangerous (because T=30 is dangerous for freeway6) -> crash.\n\nOr we can do U at turn29? to y=8 at turn30 -> freeway8 at turn30 dangerous -> crash.\n\nSo we must do S at turn29.\n\nIs there a way to get to y=9 in fewer than 6 actions?\n\nAnother idea: start by going down to y=5 at turn26? \n  Then at turn27: we are at y=5. Then we can go to y=6 at turn28 (freeway6 safe at turn28). \n  Then at turn28: we are at y=6. Then we can go to y=7 at turn29 (freeway7 safe at turn29). \n  Then at turn29: we are at y=7. Then we can go to y=8 at turn30 -> freeway8 dangerous at turn30 -> crash.\n\nSame problem.\n\nWhat if we go from y=7 at turn29 to y=9? \n  But we can only move one per turn: we must go to y=8 first.\n\nTherefore, we have to spend at least 3 moves to go from y=6 to y=9 (three ups) but we have to avoid the dangerous times. The dangerous times force us to wait or detour.\n\nThe detour we did (up, down, up, stay, up, up) is 6 actions.\n\nBut note: we are at y=6 at turn26. We want to be at y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nConsider the constraints:\n\nWe cannot be at freeway7 at turn28, freeway8 at turn28, freeway8 at turn29, freeway8 at turn30, freeway6 at turn29, freeway6 at turn30, freeway5 at turn29,30.\n\nSo we must avoid:\n\n- freeway7 at turn28\n- freeway8 at turn28,29,30\n- freeway6 at turn29,30\n- freeway5 at turn29,30\n\nAt turn26: we start at y=6 (freeway6) -> safe.\n\nWe have to leave freeway6 by turn28? because at turn29 we cannot be there.\n\nBut at turn28, we can be at freeway6? yes, safe.\n\nThen at turn29 we must not be at freeway5,6,8? and freeway7 is safe at turn29? yes.\n\nSo the earliest we can be at y=9 is turn32? because:\n\nWe need to be at y=8 at a safe turn. The earliest safe turn for freeway8 is turn31 (since 28,29,30 are dangerous). Then at turn32 we go to y=9.\n\nSo we must be at y=8 at turn31. Then we go to y=9 at turn32.\n\nHow to get to y=8 at turn31?\n\nWe are at y=6 at turn26. We have 5 turns (turn26 to turn30) to get to y=8? because at turn30 we do an action to go to y=8 at turn31? \n\nBut we must avoid the dangerous freeways at each turn.\n\nLet me denote the state as (turn, y)\n\nWe want:\n\nAt turn26: (26,6) -> safe.\n\nThen:\n\nTurn26: action -> state at turn27: (27, y27)\n\nConstraints at turn27:\n  y27 cannot be 7? because if we are at y=7 at turn27, then at turn28 we must leave? but we can be at y=7 at turn27 and then at turn28 we move to y=6 or y=8? \n  But freeway7 at turn27: we computed safe? yes (at turn27: freeway7: [-23,-12] -> safe). \n  freeway8 at turn27: \n        car: (head=-8, tail=-19, speed=4) -> at turn27: T-26=1 -> \n        tail: -19+4= -15\n        head: -8+4=-4 -> [-15,-4] -> safe.\n\nSo at turn27: safe for all freeways? \n  freeway5: safe? at turn27: \n        Car1: [13,24] -> safe\n        Car2: [-23,-12] -> safe\n        Car3: [55,66] -> safe\n  freeway6: same as freeway5 -> safe.\n\nSo turn27: any freeway is safe.\n\nBut we have to plan for the future.\n\nWe want to be at y=8 at turn31.\n\nWe have 5 moves (turn26 to turn30) to go from y=6 to y=8? that's 2 steps up? but we can take detours.\n\nThe net movement: we need to go up by 2 (from 6 to 8). So the number of U minus D must be 2.\n\nWe have 5 moves: so we can have 3 U and 2 D? or 2 U and 0 D and 3 S? etc.\n\nBut we must avoid the dangerous freeways at each turn.\n\nWe have to avoid:\n\n- At turn28: freeway7 and freeway8.\n- At turn29: freeway5,6,8.\n- At turn30: freeway5,6,8.\n\nSo:\n\nAt turn28: we can be at y=0,1,2,3,4,5,6,9? (avoid 7,8)\nAt turn29: we can be at y=0,1,2,3,4,7,9? (avoid 5,6,8)\nAt turn30: we can be at y=0,1,2,3,4,7,9? (avoid 5,6,8)\n\nAt turn31: we want to be at y=8? but then we are at freeway8 at turn31 -> safe.\n\nBut note: at turn30 we do the action to go to y=8 at turn31. So at turn30 we must be at y=7? because from y=7 we go U to y=8.\n\nWe cannot be at y=8 at turn30? because then we crash. And we cannot go from y=9 at turn30 to y=8? not allowed (we are going to y=9, and we are already at 9? but we are at 7 at turn30 to go to 8 at turn31).\n\nSo at turn30: we must be at y=7.\n\nSimilarly, at turn31: we are at y=8, then we do U to y=9 at turn32.\n\nSo the states:\n\nTurn26: y=6\nTurn27: y=?\nTurn28: y=?\nTurn29: y=?\nTurn30: y=7   (so that we can go to y=8 at turn31)\nTurn31: y=8\nTurn32: y=9\n\nNow, we have to fill in turn27,28,29.\n\nConstraints:\n\nAt turn28: y cannot be 7 or 8 -> so y28 in {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,9}\nAt turn29: y cannot be 5,6,8 -> so y29 in {0,1,2,3,4,7,9}\nAt turn30: y30 must be 7.\n\nFrom turn27: we start at turn26: y=6, and we do an action.\n\nOption: at turn26: U -> y27=7\nThen at turn27: we must choose an action to go to y28 which is not 7 or 8.\n\nFrom y=7, we can do:\n  D: y28=6\n  S: y28=7 -> not allowed (turn28: cannot be 7)\n  U: y28=8 -> not allowed.\n\nSo only D: to y=6.\n\nThen at turn28: y=6 (allowed at turn28? yes, because 6 is not 7 or 8).\n\nThen at turn28: from y=6, we do an action to go to y29 which must be in {0,1,2,3,4,7,9} and not 5,6,8.\n\nWe can do:\n  U: y29=7 -> allowed.\n  D: y29=5 -> allowed? yes, but then we are at y=5 at turn29. Then at turn30 we need to go to y=7? from y=5 to y=7 in one move? not possible (only one step per move). \n  S: y29=6 -> not allowed (at turn29: freeway6 dangerous).\n\nSo we must do U: to y=7 at turn29.\n\nThen at turn29: y=7 (allowed). Then at turn29: we do an action to go to y30=7? \n  We are at y=7, so to stay at y=7: S.\n\nThen at turn30: we are at y=7 -> then we do U to y=8 at turn31.\n\nThis is the same as our previous plan.\n\nAt turn28: after being at y=6, we could do D to y=5? \n  Then y29 would be 5? but at turn29: y=5 is allowed? \n      freeway5 at turn29: dangerous -> we must avoid freeway5 at turn29. \n  So if we go to y=5 at turn29, we crash.\n\nSo that move is not allowed.\n\nTherefore, the only safe path we have is:\n\nTurn26: U -> y=7\nTurn27: D -> y=6\nTurn28: U -> y=7\nTurn29: S -> y=7\nTurn30: U -> y=8\nTurn31: U -> y=9\n\nBut wait, at turn29 we are at y=7 and we do S -> at turn30 we are still at y=7. Then we do U at turn30 -> at turn31 we are at y=8. Then U at turn31 -> at turn32 we are at y=9.\n\nSo the last action is at turn31, and we reach y=9 at turn32. So H=6? from turn26 to turn31 (inclusive) -> 6 actions.\n\nBut the problem asks for the minimal H. Is there a way to do it in 5 actions?\n\nThen we would be at y=9 at turn31.\n\nThat means we must be at y=8 at turn30? because at turn30 we do U to go to y=9 at turn31.\n\nBut at turn30: we are at y=8 -> freeway8 at turn30 is dangerous -> crash.\n\nSo we cannot be at freeway8 at turn30.\n\nTherefore, we cannot get to y=9 by turn31.\n\nSimilarly, we cannot get to y=9 by turn30: \n  We would need to be at y=8 at turn29? then at turn29 we do U to go to y=9 at turn30.\n  But at turn29: if we are at y=8 -> freeway8 at turn29 is dangerous -> crash.\n\nAnd we cannot be at y=9 at turn29? because we start at y=6 at turn26: to get to y=9 in 3 moves? but then at turn27: y=7, turn28: y=8 (crash), turn29: y=9? but we crash at turn28.\n\nSo minimal H is 6.\n\nTherefore, we output:\n\nTurn 26: U\nTurn 27: D\nTurn 28: U\nTurn 29: S\nTurn 30: U\nTurn 31: U\n\nBut note: at turn30 we do U: from y=7 to y=8 at turn31 -> then at turn31 we are at y=8. Then at turn31 we do U: to y=9 at turn32.\n\nWe do not have an action at turn32? because the last action is at turn31.\n\nSo the sequence is 6 actions.\n\nBut the problem says: a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} so that at the next state (after the last action) we are at (0,9).\n\nHere, after the last action (turn31) we are at turn32: (0,9). So it's correct.\n\nNow, let's verify each turn:\n\nTurn26: \n  Start: (0,6) -> do U -> to (0,7) at turn27.\n  Collision at turn26: freeway6 safe -> okay.\n\nTurn27: \n  At (0,7) -> do D -> to (0,6) at turn28.\n  Check turn27: freeway7 safe? \n      Freeway7 car: at turn27: T-26=1 -> \n          tail: -35+12= -23\n          head: -24+12= -12 -> [-23,-12] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\nTurn28: \n  At (0,6) -> do U -> to (0,7) at turn29.\n  Check turn28: freeway6 safe? \n        Car1: [19,30] -> safe\n        Car2: [-17,-6] -> safe\n        Car3: [61,72] -> safe.\n\nTurn29: \n  At (0,7) -> do S -> to (0,7) at turn30.\n  Check turn29: freeway7: \n        tail: -35+12*3=-35+36=1\n        head: -24+36=12 -> [1,12] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\nTurn30: \n  At (0,7) -> do U -> to (0,8) at turn31.\n  Check turn30: freeway7: \n        tail: -35+12*4= -35+48=13\n        head: -24+48=24 -> [13,24] -> safe.\n\nTurn31: \n  At (0,8) -> do U -> to (0,9) at turn32.\n  Check turn31: freeway8: \n        tail: -19+4*5= -19+20=1\n        head: -8+20=12 -> [1,12] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\nAnd we are done.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 26: U\nTurn 27: D\nTurn 28: U\nTurn 29: S\nTurn 30: U\nTurn 31: U\n}\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" so we start with Turn 26.\n\nAnd we have 6 actions.\n\nIs there a way without the stay? \n\nSuppose we do:\n\nTurn26: U -> y=7\nTurn27: D -> y=6\nTurn28: U -> y=7\nTurn29: U -> y=8 at turn30 -> but then at turn30: freeway8 dangerous -> crash.\n\nNot safe.\n\nTurn26: S -> y=6\nTurn27: U -> y=7\nTurn28: D -> y=6\nTurn29: U -> y=7\nTurn30: U -> y=8 at turn31 -> safe\nTurn31: U -> y=9 at turn32.\n\nThis is also 6 actions and safe? \n  Check:\n  Turn26: S -> at turn27: y=6 -> safe (freeway6 at turn26? no, we are at turn26: freeway6 safe. And at turn26 we are at y=6 -> safe. Then we do S -> at turn27: y=6 -> check turn27: freeway6 safe? \n        At turn27: freeway6 cars:\n            Car1: [7+6,18+6]=[13,24] -> safe.\n            Car2: [-29+6, -18+6]=[-23,-12] -> safe.\n            Car3: [49+6,60+6]=[55,66] -> safe.\n\n  Turn27: U -> at turn28: y=7 -> check turn27: freeway6 safe? we are at turn27: freeway6 safe. Then at turn28: we are at freeway7? \n        At turn28: freeway7: [-11,0] -> dangerous? \n            tail: -35+12*2=-11\n            head: -24+24=0 -> [-11,0] -> covers 0 -> crash.\n\nSo at turn28: we crash.\n\nTherefore, the initial plan is the safe one.\n\nSo we stick to it.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 6)\\) at turn 26 is 6, with the following sequence of actions:\n\n- At turn 26, move up (U) to position \\((0, 7)\\) at turn 27.

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,7) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways. The player moves up, down, or stays, changing the y-position by +1, -1, or 0 each turn. Cars move left or right based on their speed, and I collide only if I'm on a freeway where a car occupies position x=0 at that turn.\n\nFirst, since I start at y=7 and need to reach y=9, I must move up at least twice. But I have to avoid the cars on y=1 to y=8 when I'm on those rows.\n\nThe collision condition: at turn T, if I'm on freeway y_T, and for some car on that freeway, 0 is in its span at that turn. The note says that if I move to a different y, I'm not considered on that new row until the next turn. So when I move, I'm on the starting row for that turn.\n\nLet me denote the current turn as t_1 = 27. So I need actions from turn 27 onwards.\n\nPlayer position: (0,7) at turn 27.\n\nNow, the cars are given for each freeway k from 1 to 8.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: head 24, tail 1, direction right, speed 24. Since direction is right, it's moving right, so span at time t is [τ + s(t - t_1), h + s(t - t_1)]? Let's see the update rule.\n\nFor right-moving: initial span [τ, h] at t_1, then at T, span is [τ + s(T - t_1), h + s(T - t_1)]\n\nSimilarly for left-moving: initial [h, τ], at T [h - s(T - t_1), τ - s(T - t_1)]\n\nIn this case, all cars seem to be right-moving, except let's check.\n\nFreeway 1: (24,1,right,24) — head 24, tail 1? But if direction right, and head > tail, that means it's moving to increasing x, so head should be larger, I think. In the span, for right-moving, it says [τ, h] with τ < h? But here head=24, tail=1, and direction right, so at t_1, span [1,24]? The notation says \"head h, tail τ\", and for right-moving, it says span(t_1) = [τ, h], so if τ=1, h=24, span is [1,24].\n\nThen at time T, span is [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)] = [1 + 24(T-27), 24 + 24(T-27)]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, collision at turn T on freeway k if I'm on y=k at turn T and 0 is in the span of some car on freeway k at that turn.\n\nAlso, for freeways with multiple cars, I need to check all of them.\n\nList all cars per freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (h=24, τ=1, d=right, s=24)\n\nFreeway 2: one car: (60,25,right,36) — so τ=25, h=60? Span at t_1: [25,60] for right-moving.\n\nAt T: [25 + 36(T-27), 60 + 36(T-27)]\n\nFreeway 3: same as freeway 2? (60,25,right,36) — identical to freeway 2? But different freeway, so I need to consider separately.\n\nFreeway 4: also (60,25,right,36) — same as 2 and 3? That seems odd, but possible.\n\nFreeway 5: three cars: (24,13,right,6), (-12,-23,right,6), (-48,-59,right,6)\n\nEach with their own spans.\n\nSimilarly freeway 6: same as freeway 5? (24,13,right,6), (-12,-23,right,6), (-48,-59,right,6)\n\nFreeway 7: one car: (-12,-23,right,12)\n\nFreeway 8: one car: (-4,-15,right,4)\n\nAll are right-moving.\n\nI need to find when each freeway has a car occupying x=0 at various turns.\n\nSince I start at y=7 and need to go to y=9, I can move up directly if possible, but I have to avoid y=8 when cars are at x=0.\n\ny=8 is freeway 8, which has cars.\n\nThe freeways are y=1 to 8, and I need to be on y=9, which is not a freeway, so no cars, so once I reach y=9, I'm safe.\n\ny=9 is the goal, no cars.\n\nBut to reach y=9, I need to be on y=8 at some point and move up.\n\nSimilarly, I start on y=7.\n\nNow, the critical point is when I am on a freeway row, x=0 must not be occupied at that turn.\n\nSince I move at each turn, I can choose to stay or move to delay or avoid collisions.\n\nBut I want minimal turns, so probably move up as fast as possible, unless blocked.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway and each turn around now, when x=0 is occupied.\n\nSet t = T - 27, so relative time from current turn.\n\nAt time T, for a car on freeway k, 0 in span if min_span <= 0 <= max_span.\n\nFor right-moving car, span at T: [τ + s t, h + s t] where t = T - 27.\n\nSo 0 in [τ + s t, h + s t] iff τ + s t <= 0 <= h + s t\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but all are right here.\n\nSo condition: τ + s t <= 0 and 0 <= h + s t, but since h and τ, for right-moving, if τ < h, which is usually the case, then τ + s t <= 0 <= h + s t implies that the car covers x=0 at that time.\n\nNow, solve for t where this happens.\n\nFor each car, find the t such that it occupies x=0.\n\nt here is T - 27, so for turn T.\n\nStart with freeway 1: car (τ=1, h=24, s=24)\n\nτ + s t <= 0 <= h + s t ⇒ 1 + 24t <= 0 <= 24 + 24t\n\nFirst inequality: 1 + 24t <= 0 ⇒ 24t <= -1 ⇒ t <= -1/24, which is about -0.0417, since t integer, t <= -1\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= 24 + 24t ⇒ 24t >= -24 ⇒ t >= -1\n\nSo t >= -1 and t <= -1, so only at t = -1, which is T=26, before current turn.\n\nAt t=-1, τ + s t = 1 + 24*(-1) = 1 - 24 = -23\n\nh + s t = 24 + 24*(-1) = 0\n\nSo span [-23, 0], so 0 is included.\n\nBut at t=0 (T=27), τ + s*0 =1, h + s*0=24, span [1,24], 0 not in.\n\nFor t>0, span moves right, so 0 not in.\n\nSo for freeway 1, only occupied at T=26, before now, so no issue for future turns.\n\nNow freeway 2: car (τ=25, h=60, s=36)\n\nτ + s t <= 0 <= h + s t ⇒ 25 + 36t <= 0 <= 60 + 36t\n\nFirst: 25 + 36t <= 0 ⇒ 36t <= -25 ⇒ t <= -25/36 ≈ -0.694, so t <= -1\n\nSecond: 0 <= 60 + 36t ⇒ 36t >= -60 ⇒ t >= -60/36 = -5/3 ≈ -1.666, so t >= -1.666, since t integer, t >= -1\n\nt >= -1 and t <= -1, so only at t=-1, T=26.\n\nAt t=-1, τ + s t =25 +36*(-1)=25-36=-11\n\nh + s t=60-36=24, span [-11,24], 0 in.\n\nAt t=0, span [25,60], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly freeway 3: same as freeway 2, so only at T=26.\n\nFreeway 4: same, only T=26.\n\nNow freeway 5: multiple cars.\n\nFirst car: (τ=13, h=24, s=6) for right-moving.\n\nSpan at T: [13 + 6t, 24 + 6t]\n\n0 in [13+6t, 24+6t] iff 13+6t <= 0 <= 24+6t\n\nLeft: 13+6t <=0 ⇒ 6t <= -13 ⇒ t <= -13/6 ≈ -2.166, so t <= -3? t <= -2.166, integer t <= -3? -13/6 = -2.166, so t <= -3? No.\n\nt <= -2.166, since t integer, t <= -3? -2.166, t <= -3 is -3, -4, etc., but -2 is -2 > -2.166? -2 = -12/6 > -13/6, so 13+6t at t=-2: 13 +6*(-2)=13-12=1 >0, not <=0.\n\nAt t=-3: 13+6*(-3)=13-18=-5 <=0\n\nRight: 0 <=24+6t ⇒ 6t >= -24 ⇒ t >= -4\n\nSo t >= -4 and t <= -2.166? t <= -3? From left inequality t <= -13/6 ≈ -2.166, so t <= -3 since t integer? t <= -3 means t=-3,-4,...\n\nBut t >= -4 from right.\n\nSo for t >= -4 and t <= -3.\n\nt integer: t=-4, -3\n\nAt t=-4: left: 13+6*(-4)=13-24=-11 <=0, right: 24+6*(-4)=24-24=0, so 0 in span.\n\nAt t=-3: 13-18=-5<=0, 24-18=6>=0, 0 in span.\n\nAt t=-2: 13-12=1>0, not <=0, so 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, second car on freeway 5: (-12,-23,right,6) — τ=-23, h=-12, s=6\n\nSpan at T: [τ + s t, h + s t] = [-23 + 6t, -12 + 6t]\n\n0 in if -23+6t <=0 and 0<= -12+6t\n\nFirst: -23+6t <=0 ⇒ 6t <=23 ⇒ t <= 23/6 ≈ 3.833, so t <=3\n\nSecond: 0 <= -12 +6t ⇒ 6t >=12 ⇒ t >=2\n\nSo t >=2 and t <=3\n\nt=2,3\n\nAt t=2: -23+12= -11 <=0, -12+12=0 <=0? 0 <=0 true, so yes.\n\nSpan [-23+12, -12+12] = [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nAt t=3: [-23+18, -12+18] = [-5,6], 0 in.\n\nThird car on freeway 5: (-48,-59,right,6) τ=-59, h=-48, s=6\n\nSpan [-59+6t, -48+6t]\n\n0 in if -59+6t <=0 and 0<= -48+6t\n\nFirst: -59+6t <=0 ⇒ 6t <=59 ⇒ t <=59/6≈9.833, t<=9\n\nSecond: 0<= -48+6t ⇒ 6t>=48 ⇒ t>=8\n\nSo t>=8 and t<=9\n\nt=8,9\n\nNow for freeway 5, we have three cars:\n\nCar1: occupied at t=-4,-3 → T=23,24? t=T-27, so t=-4 T=23, t=-3 T=24\n\nCar2: occupied at t=2,3 → T=29,30\n\nCar3: occupied at t=8,9 → T=35,36\n\nBut since multiple cars, freeway 5 is occupied when any car has 0 in span.\n\nSo at T=23,24 (car1), T=29,30 (car2), T=35,36 (car3)\n\nNow freeway 6: same cars as freeway 5? According to table: (24,13,right,6), (-12,-23,right,6), (-48,-59,right,6) same as freeway 5.\n\nSo identical occupation times: T=23,24;29,30;35,36\n\nBut freeway 6 is different row.\n\nNow freeway 7: one car (-12,-23,right,12) τ=-23, h=-12, s=12\n\nSpan [-23 +12t, -12 +12t]\n\n0 in if -23+12t <=0 and 0<= -12+12t\n\nFirst: -23+12t <=0 ⇒ 12t <=23 ⇒ t <= 23/12 ≈1.916, t<=1\n\nSecond: 0<= -12+12t ⇒ 12t >=12 ⇒ t>=1\n\nSo t>=1 and t<=1, only t=1\n\nAt t=1, T=28\n\nSpan: -23+12= -11, -12+12=0, so [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nNow freeway 8: one car (-4,-15,right,4) τ=-15, h=-4, s=4\n\nSpan [-15 +4t, -4 +4t]\n\n0 in if -15+4t <=0 and 0<= -4+4t\n\nFirst: -15+4t <=0 ⇒ 4t <=15 ⇒ t <=15/4=3.75, t<=3\n\nSecond: 0<= -4+4t ⇒ 4t >=4 ⇒ t>=1\n\nSo t>=1 and t<=3, t=1,2,3\n\nAt t=1: span [-15+4, -4+4] = [-11,0]\n\nt=2: [-15+8, -4+8] = [-7,4], 0 in\n\nt=3: [-15+12, -4+12] = [-3,8], 0 in\n\nt=4: [-15+16, -4+16] = [1,12], 0 not in\n\nSo freeway 8 occupied at T=28,29,30\n\nt=1,2,3 → T=28,29,30\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway, when x=0 is occupied (collision if I'm there at that turn):\n\ny=1: occupied only at T=26 (past)\n\ny=2: occupied only at T=26 (past)\n\ny=3: occupied only at T=26 (past)\n\ny=4: occupied only at T=26 (past)\n\ny=5: occupied at T=23,24 (past), T=29,30 (future), T=35,36 (future)\n\nBut T=23,24 are before t_1=27, so past, not issue.\n\nFuture: T=29,30 for car2, and T=35,36 for car3, but car2 at T=29,30.\n\ny=6: same as y=5, occupied at T=29,30 and T=35,36\n\ny=7: occupied at T=28 (only)\n\ny=8: occupied at T=28,29,30\n\ny=7 and y=8 are critical since I start at y=7.\n\nI am at y=7 at turn t=27.\n\nAt turn T=27, I am on y=7.\n\nIs y=7 occupied at T=27?\n\nFor y=7, freeway 7, occupied at T=28 only, not at T=27.\n\nAt T=27, t=0, span for y=7 car: τ=-23, h=-12, s=12, span at t=0: [-23, -12], 0 not in, since -23 to -12, all negative, 0 not <= -12? 0 <= -12 is false, so not occupied.\n\nSimilarly, at T=28, it will be occupied.\n\nNow, at turn 27, I am at (0,7), and y=7 is not occupied, so no collision now.\n\nI need to move to y=9.\n\nSince I need to go up, and y=8 is occupied at T=28,29,30, so I cannot be on y=8 at those turns.\n\nSimilarly, y=7 will be occupied at T=28, so I cannot be on y=7 at T=28.\n\nNow, possible actions: I can move up, down, or stay.\n\nBut since I need to go to y=9, moving down might not help, but I can stay to avoid being on a row when occupied.\n\nBut staying might delay, but I want minimal turns.\n\nFirst, let's see the path.\n\nI start at turn 27, y=7.\n\nAt turn 27, I can choose action: U, D, or S.\n\nIf I move up (U), at turn 28, I will be at y=8.\n\nBut at turn 28, y=8 is occupied (since freeway 8 occupied T=28,29,30), so if I am on y=8 at turn 28, I collide.\n\nIf I stay (S), at turn 28, I am still on y=7.\n\nBut at turn 28, y=7 is occupied (freeway 7 occupied at T=28), so I collide if on y=7 at T=28.\n\nIf I move down (D), to y=6 at turn 28.\n\nBut y=6 might be occupied or not.\n\nAt turn 28, what about y=6?\n\nFreeway 6: occupied at T=29,30,35,36, not at T=28.\n\nAt T=28, t=1, for freeway 6 cars.\n\nCar1 on y=6: at t=1, span [13+6(1), 24+6(1)] = [19,30], 0 not in.\n\nCar2: [-23+6(1), -12+6(1)] = [-17,-6], 0 not in.\n\nCar3: [-59+6(1), -48+6(1)] = [-53,-42], 0 not in.\n\nSo y=6 not occupied at T=28.\n\nSimilarly, y=5 not occupied at T=28: freeway 5 same as y=6, cars same, so not occupied.\n\ny=4: not occupied since only past.\n\nBut y=4 is below, I need to go up.\n\nBack to turn 27 actions.\n\nIf I move down to y=6 at turn 28, I avoid collision since y=6 not occupied at T=28.\n\nThen I can move up later.\n\nBut I need to reach y=9.\n\ny=9 is safe, no cars.\n\nNow, the occupations:\n\ny=7 occupied only at T=28\n\ny=8 occupied at T=28,29,30\n\ny=6 occupied at T=29,30 (from above)\n\ny=5 occupied at T=29,30, etc.\n\nTo reach y=9, I need to be at y=8 at some turn and move up to y=9.\n\nWhen I move to y=9, I don't care about cars since no freeway.\n\nBut I have to be on y=8 at a turn when it is not occupied.\n\nSimilarly, to be on y=8, I come from y=7 or y=9, but y=9 is goal, so from y=7.\n\nOr I could go to y=8 from below or above, but above is y=9, so mainly from y=7.\n\nSince I can move down, I could go to lower rows and come back.\n\nBut that might take more turns.\n\nMinimal H, so probably avoid unnecessary moves.\n\nNow, y=8 is occupied until T=30, so I cannot be on y=8 at T=28,29,30.\n\nAfter T=30, y=8 might be free.\n\nAt T=31, what about y=8?\n\nFreeway 8: car span at T, t=T-27.\n\nAt T=31, t=4, span [-15+4*4, -4+4*4] = [-15+16, -4+16] = [1,12], 0 not in, so not occupied.\n\nSimilarly, T=32, etc., should be free.\n\ny=7 occupied only at T=28, so after that, free.\n\ny=6 occupied at T=29,30.\n\nAt T=31, y=6: t=4, car1: [13+24,24+24]? t=4, s=6, [13+24,24+24] no.\n\nt=4, s=6, [13 +6*4, 24+6*4] = [13+24,24+24] = [37,48], 0 not in.\n\nCar2: [-23+24, -12+24] = [1,12], 0 not in? 1 to 12, 0 not included.\n\nCar3: [-59+24, -48+24] = [-35,-24], 0 not in.\n\nSo y=6 not occupied at T=31.\n\nSimilarly, y=5 same.\n\nBut I don't need to go below.\n\nNow, back to turn 27.\n\nAt turn 27, I must not stay or move up, because:\n\n- If U: at turn 28, y=8 occupied, collide.\n\n- If S: at turn 28, y=7 occupied, collide.\n\n- If D: at turn 28, y=6, not occupied, safe.\n\nSo I must move down to y=6 at turn 28 to avoid collision.\n\nAction at turn 27: D\n\nThen at turn 28, position y=6.\n\nNow, turn 28: I am at y=6.\n\nNow, at turn 28, y=6 is not occupied, as we saw.\n\nNow, I need to choose action for turn 28.\n\nOptions: U, D, S.\n\nIf I move up to y=7 at turn 29.\n\nBut at turn 29, y=7: is it occupied?\n\ny=7 occupied only at T=28, not at T=29 or later.\n\nAt T=29, t=2, y=7 car: span [-23 +12*2, -12+12*2] = [-23+24, -12+24] = [1,12], 0 not in, so not occupied.\n\nSimilarly, T=30, etc., free.\n\nSo y=7 is safe at T=29.\n\nBut if I move up to y=7 at turn 29, I need to be on y=7 at turn 29.\n\nNow, at turn 28, if I move U, at turn 29 I am at y=7, which is safe.\n\nBut I need to go to y=8 or y=9.\n\ny=8 is occupied at T=29 and T=30.\n\nAt turn 29, if I am on y=7, I can choose to move to y=8 or not.\n\nBut y=8 occupied at T=29.\n\nIf I move U at turn 29, I go to y=8 at turn 30.\n\nTurn and position timing.\n\nAt turn T, I am at position y_T.\n\nAfter action, at turn T+1, I am at y_{T+1}.\n\nCollision at turn T if on freeway y_T and occupied at T.\n\nAt turn 28, I am at y=6.\n\nAction at turn 28:\n\n- If U: move to y=7 at turn 29.\n\nAt turn 29, I am on y=7, which is not occupied, so safe.\n\n- If S: stay at y=6 at turn 29.\n\nBut at turn 29, y=6 is occupied? Freeway 6 occupied at T=29,30.\n\nAt T=29, t=2, freeway 6 car2: span [-23 +6*2, -12+6*2] = [-23+12, -12+12] = [-11,0], 0 included, so occupied.\n\nSimilarly, car1: [13+12,24+12]=[25,36], no; car3: [-59+12,-48+12]=[-47,-36], no; but car2 has 0 in span, so y=6 occupied at T=29.\n\nThus, if I stay at turn 28, at turn 29 I am on y=6, which is occupied, collide.\n\nIf I move down to y=5 at turn 29.\n\ny=5 at T=29: similarly, freeway 5 car2 occupied at T=29, same as above, so occupied, collide if on y=5.\n\nSo at turn 28, if I do S or D, I go to y=6 or y=5 at turn 29, both occupied, collide.\n\nTherefore, I must move up to y=7 at turn 29.\n\nSo action at turn 28: U\n\nThen at turn 29, I am at y=7, which is not occupied, safe.\n\nNow, turn 29: I am at y=7.\n\nAction: U, D, or S.\n\nI want to go to y=8 or y=9.\n\nBut y=8 occupied at T=29,30.\n\nAt turn 29, if I move U to y=8 at turn 30.\n\nThen at turn 30, I am on y=8, which is occupied (since T=30 occupied), so collide.\n\nIf I stay at y=7 at turn 30.\n\nAt turn 30, y=7 is not occupied, as we saw, span [1,12] or something, not 0.\n\nSo safe.\n\nIf I move down, but not helpful.\n\nSo at turn 29, I should not move up, because that would put me on y=8 at turn 30 when occupied.\n\nI can stay at y=7 for now.\n\nAction S: stay at y=7 at turn 30.\n\nThen at turn 30, I am on y=7, not occupied, safe.\n\nNow, turn 30: I am at y=7.\n\nNow, y=8 is occupied at T=30, so I cannot move to y=8 yet.\n\nAfter T=30, y=8 is free.\n\nAt turn 30, I can choose.\n\nIf I move U to y=8 at turn 31.\n\nAt turn 31, I am on y=8.\n\nNow, y=8 at T=31: not occupied, as we saw earlier, span [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nThen I can move to y=9 from there.\n\nIf I stay or move down, it delays.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nAt turn 30, position y=7.\n\nAction:\n\n- If U: move to y=8 at turn 31. Then at turn 31 on y=8, not occupied, safe. Then I can move to y=9 at turn 32.\n\n- If S: stay at y=7 at turn 31. Then at turn 31 on y=7, not occupied, but I need to move up later.\n\n- If D: down to y=6 at turn 31.\n\ny=6 at T=31: not occupied, as earlier.\n\nBut moving down not efficient.\n\nSo best to move up when possible.\n\nAt turn 30, if I move U, I go to y=8 at turn 31, safe.\n\nThen at turn 31, I can move U to y=9 at turn 32.\n\nNow, let's list the sequence.\n\nStart turn 27: position y=7\n\nAction: must move down, D, to y=6 at turn 28.\n\nTurn 28: position y=6\n\nAction: must move up, U, to y=7 at turn 29.\n\nTurn 29: position y=7\n\nAction: should stay or something, but if I stay, at turn 30 position y=7.\n\nThen at turn 30, I can move U to y=8 at turn 31.\n\nBut at turn 29, I can choose to stay or move down, but moving down not good.\n\nSince y=8 occupied until T=30, I cannot be on y=8 before T=31.\n\nSo at turn 29, I should not move to y=8 immediately.\n\nSo I can stay at y=7.\n\nAction at turn 29: S\n\nThen turn 30: position y=7\n\nAction: U, to y=8 at turn 31\n\nTurn 31: position y=8\n\nNow, y=8 not occupied at T=31.\n\nThen I can move up to y=9.\n\nAction at turn 31: U, to y=9 at turn 32.\n\nAt turn 32, position y=9, which is goal.\n\nNow, what about the number of turns.\n\nH is the number of actions, from t=0 to H-1.\n\nSequence of actions from turn t_1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nt_1 = 27.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 27: D\n\nTurn 28: U\n\nTurn 29: S\n\nTurn 30: U\n\nTurn 31: U\n\nThen at turn 32, y=9.\n\nBut turn 32 is when I reach y=9, after action at turn 31.\n\nThe position after H actions should be (0,9).\n\nStart at turn 27, y=7.\n\nAfter one action (t=0), at turn 28, y=6\n\nAfter two actions (t=1), turn 29, y=7\n\nAfter three actions (t=2), turn 30, y=7 (stayed)\n\nAfter four actions (t=3), turn 31, y=8\n\nAfter five actions (t=4), turn 32, y=9\n\nSo H=5 actions, reach at turn 32.\n\nBut is there a shorter way?\n\nH=5 turns of actions.\n\nCan I do in fewer?\n\nFor example, if I don't move down, but we saw I must at turn 27.\n\nSuppose at turn 27, I move down to y=6.\n\nThen at turn 28, I could move down further? But y=5 at T=28 not occupied, but then I need to come back up.\n\nFor example, turn 27: D to y=6 at t28\n\nTurn 28: D to y=5 at t29\n\nBut at turn 29, y=5 is occupied, collide.\n\nTurn 28: if I move down to y=5 at turn 29, but at turn 29, y=5 occupied, collide.\n\nAt turn 28, I must move up to y=7, as before.\n\nTurn 28: if I stay at y=6, at turn 29 y=6 occupied, collide.\n\nSo only choice at turn 28 is to move up to y=7.\n\nThen at turn 29, I have to stay or something, but I cannot move up immediately because y=8 occupied.\n\nAt turn 29, if I move up, I go to y=8 at turn 30, when occupied, collide.\n\nSo I have to stay at turn 29 to be on y=7 at turn 30.\n\nThen move up at turn 30 to y=8 at turn 31.\n\nThen to y=9 at turn 32.\n\nCould I move to y=9 directly? No, I need to pass through y=8.\n\ny=9 is not freeway, but to reach it, I must be on y=8 and move up.\n\nUnless I jump, but no, only +1 per turn.\n\nSo I think H=5 is minimal.\n\nBut let's confirm the actions.\n\nTurn 27: action D\n\nTurn 28: action U\n\nTurn 29: action S\n\nTurn 30: action U\n\nTurn 31: action U\n\nThen at turn 32, y=9.\n\nNow, check for collisions.\n\nAt turn 27: position y=7, freeway 7 not occupied at T=27, as we saw, safe.\n\nAction D: move to y=6 at turn 28.\n\nAt turn 28: position y=6, freeway 6 not occupied at T=28, as earlier, safe.\n\nAction U: move to y=7 at turn 29.\n\nAt turn 29: position y=7, freeway 7 not occupied at T=29 (span [1,12]), safe.\n\nAction S: stay, so at turn 30, position still y=7.\n\nAt turn 30: position y=7, not occupied, safe.\n\nAction U: move to y=8 at turn 31.\n\nAt turn 31: position y=8, freeway 8: at T=31, t=4, span [1,12], 0 not in, safe.\n\nAction U: move to y=9 at turn 32.\n\nAt turn 32, y=9, no freeway, goal reached.\n\nNow, H=5 actions.\n\nIs there a way with H=4?\n\nSuppose I start at turn 27 y=7.\n\nAfter 4 actions, at turn 31, where am I?\n\nIf actions: suppose turn 27: D to y=6 at t28\n\nTurn 28: U to y=7 at t29\n\nTurn 29: U to y=8 at t30 → but at t30, y=8 occupied, collide.\n\nTurn 29: if I don't move up, but stay, then at t30 y=7, then I need to move up later.\n\nWith 4 actions, I can only reach up to turn 31 position.\n\nFrom turn 27 to turn 31, after 4 actions.\n\nStart t27 y7\n\nAfter action1 at t27, to y6 at t28\n\nAction2 at t28, to y7 at t29\n\nAction3 at t29, if U to y8 at t30 → collide\n\nIf S to y7 at t30\n\nThen action4 at t30, if U to y8 at t31\n\nBut at t31, y=8, not goal, y=9 not reached.\n\nIf at t30 I move U, to y8 at t31, then I need another action to go to y9.\n\nSimilarly, if at t29 I move down, say to y6 at t30, but y6 occupied at t30, collide.\n\nNo way to reach y9 by turn 31 with 4 actions.\n\nMinimum H=5.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=9 faster from other rows, but no, only adjacent moves.\n\nSo H=5 is minimal.\n\nNow, the sequence:\n\nTurn 27: D\n\nTurn 28: U\n\nTurn 29: S\n\nTurn 30: U\n\nTurn 31: U\n\nIn the answer format, it should be for turns starting from t_1.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 27: a_{27} = D\n\nTurn 28: a_{28} = U\n\nTurn 29: a_{29} = S\n\nTurn 30: a_{30} = U\n\nTurn 31: a_{31} = U\n\nAnd at turn 32, y=9, but we don't need to specify the action after reaching, I think.\n\nThe sequence is up to when we reach, so H actions, last action brings to y=9.\n\nIn this case, after action at turn 31, at turn 32 y=9.\n\nSo actions from turn 27 to turn 31, 5 actions.\n\nNow, in the box.\n\nBut let's write the answer.\n</think>\nTo reach the position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 7) at turn 27 while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8, the minimal number of turns H is 5. The sequence of actions is determined by analyzing the car positions and their movements to ensure the player is never on a freeway row where x=0 is occupied by a car at that turn.\n\n### Key Points from Car Occupancy:\n- **Freeway 7 (y=7)**: Occupied at turn 28 only (span [-11, 0]).\n- **Freeway 8 (y=8)**: Occupied at turns 28, 29, and 30 (spans [-11, 0], [-7, 4], [-3, 8] respectively).\n- **Freeway 6 (y=6)**: Occupied at turns 29 and 30 (due to car with span [-11, 0] at these turns).\n- Other freeways (y=1 to y=5) are either unoccupied or occupied only at past turns relative to turn 27, so they do not affect future moves.\n\n### Strategy:\n- At turn 27, moving up (U) or staying (S) would place the player on y=7 or y=8 at turn 28, both occupied, causing a collision. Moving down (D) to y=6 avoids collision, as y=6 is unoccupied at turn 28.\n- At turn 28, staying (S) or moving down (D) would place the player on y=6 or y=5 at turn 29, both occupied, causing a collision. Moving up (U) to y=7 avoids collision, as y=7 is unoccupied at turn 29.\n- At turn 29, moving up (U) would place the player on y=8 at turn 30, which is occupied, causing a collision. Staying (S) keeps the player on y=7, which is unoccupied at turn 30.\n- At turn 30, the player is on y=7 (unoccupied). Moving up (U) to y=8 at turn 31 is safe, as y=8 is unoccupied at turn 31 (span [1, 12]).\n- At turn 31, moving up (U) to y=9 reaches the goal, as y=9 has no cars.\n\nThis sequence ensures the player avoids all collisions and reaches y=9 in the minimal number of turns (H=5).\n\n### Action Sequence:\n- Turn 27: Move down (D) to avoid collision on y=7 at turn 28.\n- Turn 28: Move up (U) to y=7, avoiding collision on y=6 at turn 29.\n- Turn 29: Stay (S) to avoid moving to occupied y=8 at turn 30.\n- Turn 30: Move up (U) to y=8, as y=8 is unoccupied at turn 31.\n- Turn 31: Move up (U) to y=9, reaching the goal.\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 27: \\ a_{27} = D \\\\ \\text{Turn } 28: \\ a_{28} = U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 29: \\ a_{29} = S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 30: \\ a_{30} = U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 31: \\ a_{31} = U }",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to get the player from (0,6) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t_1 = 28, and I have to output a sequence of actions starting from turn 28.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing the y-position by +1, -1, or 0 respectively, but y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCollisions happen only if at some turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T (which is between 1 and 8), and for that freeway, there's a car such that 0 is in its span at that turn. The span is the interval covered by the car.\n\nThe car positions are given for turn t_1=28, and for future turns, I need to compute their spans based on their speed and direction.\n\nAlso, note that when you move to a new y-position, you're not on that freeway until the next turn. So if at turn T you move from y to y+1, you're still on y at turn T, and only on y+1 at turn T+1. So for collision, at turn T, we only care about the freeway y_T that you're on at that turn.\n\nThe goal is to reach y=9, which is not a freeway (since freeways are y=1 to 8), so once you're on y=9, there are no cars, so no collision possible. Similarly, y=0 might be safe, but we start at y=6 and need to go to y=9, so probably we'll be moving up.\n\nNow, let's list the car states for each freeway at turn 28.\n\nFreeway 1: one car, head 48, tail 25, direction right, speed 24. Since it's right-moving, the span is [τ, h] = [25, 48] at t=28? No.\n\nThe notation says: for left-moving, span is [h, τ], but for right-moving, it's [τ, h]. Let me read carefully.\n\n\"Left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\"\n\nFor left-moving, h is head, τ is tail, and since it's moving left, decreasing x, so at T, span is [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT], so if h > τ, then head is on the right, tail on left, moving left.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving: \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\"\n\nHere it says Span(t_1) = [τ, h] for right-moving, so τ is the left end, h is the right end, since it's moving right, increasing x.\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 1: (48, 25, right, 24). So head=48, tail=25, direction right.\n\nBut according to the span definition for right-moving, Span(t_1) = [τ, h] = [25, 48].\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFreeway 2: (-48, -83, right, 36). Head=-48, tail=-83, direction right. Span = [τ, h] = [-83, -48].\n\nFreeway 3: same as freeway 2, (-48, -83, right, 36)\n\nFreeway 4: same, (-48, -83, right, 36)\n\nFreeway 5 has three cars: (30, 19, right, 6), (-6, -17, right, 6), (-42, -53, right, 6)\n\nFor each, span at t=28: for first car, [19, 30], second [ -17, -6], third [ -53, -42]\n\nFreeway 6 same as freeway 5: (30,19,right,6), (-6,-17,right,6), (-42,-53,right,6)\n\nFreeway 7: (0, -11, right, 12) so head=0, tail=-11, direction right, speed 12. Span = [τ, h] = [-11, 0]\n\nFreeway 8: (0, -11, right, 4) head=0, tail=-11, direction right, speed 4. Span = [-11, 0]\n\nCollision occurs if at turn T, the player is on freeway k, and 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nSince the player is at x=0 always, I think, as position is (0,y), so we only care if 0 is within the car's span on the freeway the player is on at that turn.\n\nNow, we start at turn 28, y=6.\n\nI need to go to y=9, so I need to increase y by 3. Each U action increases y by 1, so minimum 3 turns if I can go up directly. But I need to avoid collisions, so I might need to wait or go down sometimes, but since we're going up, probably not down, but let's see.\n\nFirst, let's check for each freeway when 0 is in the car's span, so that if the player is on that freeway at that turn, it would be a collision.\n\nSince the player moves one y per turn, I need to simulate the path.\n\nBut the cars move continuously, so for each freeway, I can find the times when 0 is covered by a car.\n\nLet ΔT = T - t_1 = T - 28.\n\nFor each car, the span at T is:\n\nFor right-moving car: span(T) = [τ + s ΔT, h + s ΔT]\n\nFor left-moving, but in this case, all cars seem to be right-moving; let me check.\n\nFreeway 1: right\n\n2: right\n\n3: right\n\n4: right\n\n5: all right\n\n6: all right\n\n7: right\n\n8: right\n\nAll cars are right-moving, so only right-moving formulas.\n\nSo span at T: [τ + s (T-28), h + s (T-28)]\n\n0 is in span if τ + s (T-28) ≤ 0 ≤ h + s (T-28)\n\nSince for right-moving, τ ≤ h, I assume, but let's confirm the values.\n\nFor example, freeway 1: τ=25, h=48, s=24, so span at T: [25 + 24ΔT, 48 + 24ΔT]\n\n0 is in this if 25 + 24ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ 48 + 24ΔT\n\nBut 25 + 24ΔT ≤ 0 implies 24ΔT ≤ -25, ΔT ≤ -25/24 ≈ -1.041, but since ΔT = T-28, and T ≥ 28, ΔT ≥0, so 25 + 24ΔT ≥ 25 >0, so 0 < 25 + 24ΔT ≤ 0 is impossible. Similarly, 48 + 24ΔT >0 always. So 0 is never in this span for T≥28. So on freeway 1, no collision possible for T≥28.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: τ=-83, h=-48, s=36\n\nSpan: [-83 + 36ΔT, -48 + 36ΔT]\n\n0 in span if -83 + 36ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ -48 + 36ΔT\n\nFirst inequality: -83 + 36ΔT ≤ 0 ⇒ 36ΔT ≤ 83 ⇒ ΔT ≤ 83/36 ≈ 2.305\n\nSecond inequality: 0 ≤ -48 + 36ΔT ⇒ 36ΔT ≥ 48 ⇒ ΔT ≥ 48/36 = 4/3 ≈ 1.333\n\nSo for ΔT between approx 1.333 and 2.305, i.e., T from 28 + 1.333 = 29.333 to 28 + 2.305 = 30.305, so turns T=30? Since turns are discrete, ΔT integer? T is turn number, so integer.\n\nΔT = T - 28, integer ≥0.\n\nSo 0 in span if -83 + 36ΔT ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ -48 + 36ΔT\n\nSo 36ΔT ≤ 83 and 36ΔT ≥ 48\n\nΔT ≥ ceil(48/36) = ceil(4/3) = ceil(1.333) = 2? Let's calculate exactly.\n\n36ΔT ≥ 48 ⇒ ΔT ≥ 48/36 = 4/3 ≈1.333, so since ΔT integer, ΔT ≥ 2\n\n36ΔT ≤ 83 ⇒ ΔT ≤ 83/36 ≈2.305, so ΔT ≤ 2\n\nΔT ≤ 2 and ΔT ≥ 2, so ΔT=2\n\nThen for ΔT=2, check: -83 + 36*2 = -83 + 72 = -11 ≤ 0\n\n-48 + 36*2 = -48 + 72 = 24 ≥ 0, so yes, 0 in [-11,24]?

Freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8.\n\ny=6 is freeway 6.\n\nAt turn 28, player is on freeway 6.\n\nNow, on freeway 6, at T=28, is there collision?\n\nFreeway 6 has cars: at T=28, for second car, span [-17, -6], 0 not in, since -17 to -6, all negative, 0 not in.\n\nEarlier I said for freeway 6, collision at T=29 and 30, but not at 28.\n\nLet me confirm.\n\nFor freeway 6, second car at T=28: ΔT=0, span [-17, -6], min=-17, max=-6, so 0 not in [-17,-6], since -6 <0? -6 is less than 0, so all x≤ -6 <0, so 0 not in span.\n\nSimilarly, first car [19,30], 0 not in.\n\nThird car [-53,-42], 0 not in.\n\nSo at T=28, no car on freeway 6 covers 0, so no collision at start.\n\nBut freeway 7 and 8 have collision at T=28, but player is not on them.\n\nNow, player action: at turn T, player chooses action, which determines y_{T+1}.\n\nThe update is: at turn t, action a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nAnd collision at turn t depends on y_t and the cars on freeway y_t at turn t.\n\nWe are at turn t_1=28, y=6.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nPossible actions: U, D, S.\n\nIf U, y becomes 7 at turn 29.\n\nIf S, y stays 6 at turn 29.\n\nIf D, y becomes 5 at turn 29.\n\nNow, we need to avoid being on a freeway when 0 is covered by a car there.\n\nFirst, let's list for each freeway and turn when it is dangerous.\n\nMake a table for turns T=28,29,30,31,... but since min turns to reach y=9 is 3 (up,up,up), and collisions up to T=30, probably up to T=31 or so.\n\nFreeway 1: never dangerous\n\nFreeway 2: dangerous at T=30\n\nFreeway 3: dangerous at T=30\n\nFreeway 4: dangerous at T=30\n\nFreeway 5: dangerous at T=29 and 30\n\nFreeway 6: dangerous at T=29 and 30\n\nFreeway 7: dangerous at T=28\n\nFreeway 8: dangerous at T=28,29,30\n\nNow, player position:\n\nAt turn 28: y=6 (freeway 6)\n\nFreeway 6 at T=28: not dangerous, as we saw.\n\nNow, action at turn 28:\n\nIf we do U: then at turn 29, y=7 (freeway 7)\n\nFreeway 7 at T=29: is it dangerous?\n\nFreeway 7: collision only at T=28, as we saw. At T=29, span: ΔT=1, [ -11 +12*1, 12*1] = [1,12], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nIf we do S: at turn 29, y=6, freeway 6 at T=29: dangerous? Yes, at T=29, freeway 6 has collision, as per above.\n\nSimilarly, if D: at turn 29, y=5, freeway 5 at T=29: dangerous, since T=29 collision.\n\nSo at turn 28, if we do S or D, at turn 29 we are on a dangerous freeway.\n\nBut if we do U, at turn 29 we are on y=7, freeway 7, which is safe at T=29.\n\nThen, at turn 29, we need to choose action.\n\nNow, we need to reach y=9.\n\nFrom y=7, we can go to y=8 or y=6 or stay.\n\nBut we need to go up to y=9.\n\nNow, freeway 8 at T=29: dangerous, since collision at T=29.\n\nFreeway 7 at T=30: let's see.\n\nFirst, let's plan the path.\n\nOption: at turn 28, do U, so to y=7 at turn 29.\n\nAt turn 29, y=7.\n\nNow, action at turn 29.\n\nIf we do U: to y=8 at turn 30.\n\nBut at turn 30, y=8 (freeway 8), and freeway 8 at T=30 is dangerous.\n\nIf we do S: stay at y=7 at turn 30.\n\nFreeway 7 at T=30: ΔT=2, span for freeway 7: [ -11 +12*2, 12*2] = [ -11+24, 24] = [13,24], 0 not in, safe.\n\nIf we do D: to y=6 at turn 30, but freeway 6 at T=30 dangerous.\n\nSo at turn 29, from y=7, if we do U, to y=8 at turn 30, which is dangerous.\n\nIf we do S, to y=7 at turn 30, safe.\n\nIf we do D, to y=6 at turn 30, dangerous.\n\nSo only safe is to do S at turn 29, stay at y=7 for turn 30.\n\nThen at turn 30, we are at y=7.\n\nNow, turn 30, action.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nFrom y=7, we can do U to y=8 at turn 31.\n\nBut at turn 31, what is the state.\n\nFirst, freeway 8 at T=31: dangerous? Freeway 8 collision at T=28,29,30, but T=31: ΔT=3, span [ -11 +4*3, 4*3] = [ -11+12, 12] = [1,12], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways: at T=31, freeway 2,3,4,5,6 might be dangerous only up to T=30, let's check.\n\nFreeway 2 at T=31: ΔT=3, span [-83 +36*3, -48 +36*3] = [-83+108, -48+108] = [25,60], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly freeway 3 and 4 same.\n\nFreeway 5: at T=31, second car: ΔT=3, span [-17+18, -6+18] = [1,12], 0 not in. Third car not yet.\n\nSimilarly freeway 6 same.\n\nFreeway 7: [13,24] safe.\n\nFreeway 8: [1,12] safe as above.\n\nSo at T=31, all freeways safe, I think.\n\nBut we need to be on freeway at that turn only if we are on it.\n\nNow back to turn 30: at turn 30, after action at turn 29 S, we are at y=7, turn 30.\n\nAction at turn 30: we can do U, to y=8 at turn 31.\n\nAt turn 31, y=8, freeway 8, which is safe at T=31.\n\nThen from there, at turn 31, we can do U to y=9 at turn 32.\n\ny=9 is not a freeway, so no collision.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9, which is at the position after action.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 28: action U, so y_{29} = 6 +1 =7\n\nAt turn 28, we are on y=6. Action a_t determines y_{t+1}.\n\nSo after action at turn t, position at turn t+1 is set.\n\nCollision at turn t depends on y_t.\n\nIn this case, at turn 28, y=6, safe.\n\nAction U: so at turn 29, y=7.\n\nAt turn 29, y=7, which is freeway 7.\n\nNow, freeway 7 at T=29: as above, ΔT=1, span [1,12], 0 not in, safe.\n\nThen action at turn 29: we do S (stay), so y_{30} =7 (since S, Δy=0)\n\nAt turn 30, y=7, freeway 7.\n\nFreeway 7 at T=30: ΔT=2, span [13,24], 0 not in, safe.\n\nThen action at turn 30: U, so y_{31} =7+1=8\n\nAt turn 31, y=8, freeway 8.\n\nFreeway 8 at T=31: ΔT=3, span [1,12], 0 not in, safe.\n\nThen action at turn 31: U, so y_{32} =8+1=9, reached.\n\nNow, at turn 32, y=9, not a freeway, so no issue.\n\nBut we need to output the actions from turn t_1=28 to when we reach.\n\nH is the number of turns, from t=0 to H-1 relative to t_1.\n\nt_1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nIn this sequence:\n\nAt turn 28: action U\n\nTurn 29: action S\n\nTurn 30: action U\n\nTurn 31: action U\n\nThen at turn 32, y=9.\n\nSo we reached at turn 32, which is after 4 actions: t from 0 to 3, since t=0: turn 28, t=1: turn 29, t=2: turn 30, t=3: turn 31, and after that, at turn 32, position is (0,9).\n\nThe sequence is actions for turns t_1 to t_1 + H - 1, and after H actions, we are at (0,9) at turn t_1 + H.\n\nStart: turn t_1=28, position (0,y_t1) = (0,6)\n\nAfter action a_{t1}, we have y_{t1+1}, and so on.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t_1 + H, position should be (0,9).\n\nIn this case, with actions: turn 28: U → y29=7\n\nTurn 29: S → y30=7\n\nTurn 30: U → y31=8\n\nTurn 31: U → y32=9\n\nSo at turn 32, y=9, which is t_1 + 4, since 28+4=32.\n\nH=4 actions: from t=0 to t=3.\n\nBut is this minimal? Minimum would be 3, but can we do it in 3?\n\nSuppose at turn 28, U to y=7 at 29.\n\nThen at turn 29, instead of S, if we do U, to y=8 at turn 30.\n\nBut at turn 30, y=8, freeway 8, which is dangerous at T=30, since collision.\n\nAs per earlier, freeway 8 at T=30: span [-3,8]? ΔT=2, [ -11+4*2, 4*2] = [-11+8,8] = [-3,8], and 0 is in [-3,8], so yes, collision.\n\nSo cannot be on y=8 at turn 30.\n\nIf at turn 28, we do S, stay at y=6, but at turn 29, y=6, freeway 6, which is dangerous at T=29, since collision.\n\nSimilarly, if down, worse.\n\nSo we cannot go directly; we need to wait or something.\n\nAnother option: at turn 28, do nothing? But we need to move.\n\nPerhaps go down first, but y=5 at turn 29, freeway 5, which is dangerous at T=29.\n\nSo only safe immediate move is up to y=7 at turn 29.\n\nThen at turn 29, we cannot go up to y=8 because at turn 30 it would be dangerous.\n\nWe can go down? But that seems counterproductive.\n\nAt turn 29, from y=7, if we do D, to y=6 at turn 30.\n\nBut at turn 30, y=6, freeway 6, dangerous.\n\nNot good.\n\nSo only stay at y=7 for turn 30, as I had.\n\nThen at turn 30, from y=7, we can go up to y=8 at turn 31.\n\nThen to y=9 at turn 32.\n\nBut turn 31 to y=8, safe, then up to y=9.\n\nIs there a way to do in 3 turns?\n\nSuppose we start at turn 28, y=6.\n\nIf we could be at y=9 by turn 31, that would be H=3 actions: turn 28,29,30 actions, position at turn 31.\n\nActions at turn 28,29,30 determine y29,y30,y31.\n\nSet y31=9.\n\ny31 = y30 + Δy30\n\nSimilarly, y30 = y29 + Δy29\n\ny29 = y28 + Δy28\n\ny28=6.\n\nSo to have y31=9, we need net +3 in three steps, so all U, or two U and one S, etc., but y must be integer, so possible sequences: U,U,U; or U,U,S; etc., but to reach exactly 9.\n\ny31=9.\n\nNow, positions:\n\nAt turn 28: y=6\n\nAfter a28, y29 = 6 + Δy28\n\nThen at turn 29: y29, collision check.\n\nThen a29, y30 = y29 + Δy29\n\nTurn 30: y30, collision\n\na30, y31 = y30 + Δy30\n\ny31=9.\n\nNow, collision at turn 29 and 30 must be avoided.\n\nFor turn 29: y29 must be such that freeway y29 is safe at T=29.\n\nSimilarly for T=30.\n\nNow, at T=29, which freeways are safe?\n\nFreeway 1: always safe\n\nFreeway 2: not dangerous at T=29? Freeway 2 dangerous only at T=30, earlier.\n\nAt T=29: freeway 2, ΔT=1, span [-83+36, -48+36] = [-47,-12], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nSimilarly freeway 3 and 4 same.\n\nFreeway 5: at T=29, dangerous? Yes, second car covers 0.\n\nFreeway 6: dangerous at T=29.\n\nFreeway 7: at T=29, safe, as [1,12]\n\nFreeway 8: dangerous at T=29.\n\nSo at T=29, dangerous freeways: 5,6,8\n\nSafe: 1,2,3,4,7\n\ny29 can be from 0 to 9, but freeways 1-8, y=0 and y=9 not freeways, so always safe, I assume.\n\ny=0: not a freeway, so no car, safe.\n\ny=9: safe.\n\nBut at turn 29, if y29=0 or 9, no collision possible.\n\nSimilarly for any turn.\n\nIn this case, for T=29, safe positions: y=0,1,2,3,4,7,9? y=1 is freeway 1, safe; y=2 freeway 2 safe; y=3 freeway 3 safe; y=4 freeway 4 safe; y=5 dangerous; y=6 dangerous; y=7 safe; y=8 dangerous; y=0 and y=9 safe.\n\ny=8 is freeway 8, dangerous at T=29.\n\nSimilarly, y=5 and 6 dangerous.\n\nNow, y29 must be one of safe: 0,1,2,3,4,7,9\n\nSimilarly, for T=30: which y safe.\n\nAt T=30:\n\nFreeway 1: safe\n\nFreeway 2: dangerous at T=30\n\nFreeway 3: dangerous\n\nFreeway 4: dangerous\n\nFreeway 5: dangerous\n\nFreeway 6: dangerous\n\nFreeway 7: safe, [13,24]\n\nFreeway 8: dangerous\n\nSo safe at T=30: freeway 1,7; and y=0,9.\n\ny=1 safe, y=7 safe.\n\ny=2,3,4,5,6,8 dangerous.\n\ny=0 and 9 safe.\n\nNow, back to path.\n\nWe need y31=9.\n\ny29 must be safe at T=29, and y30 must be safe at T=30.\n\ny30 = y29 + Δy29\n\ny31 = y30 + Δy30 =9\n\nSince y31=9, and y30 between 0 and 9, so Δy30 must be such that y30 + Δy30 =9, so if y30=9, Δy30=0 (S); if y30=8, Δy30=1 (U); but y30=8 dangerous at T=30, not safe; similarly y30=7, Δy30=2, but max Δy is 1, so not possible; y30 must be 8 or 9 to reach y31=9.\n\ny31 = y30 + Δy30\n\nSince |Δy| <=1, y31 can be y30-1, y30, or y30+1.\n\nFor y31=9, y30 must be 8,9, or 10, but y<=9, so y30=8 or 9.\n\nIf y30=8, then Δy30=U to y31=9\n\nIf y30=9, then Δy30=S to y31=9\n\nBut at T=30, y30 must be safe.\n\ny30=8: freeway 8, dangerous at T=30, not safe.\n\ny30=9: safe, no freeway.\n\nSo only possibility: y30=9, and Δy30=S, so y31=9.\n\nThen, for y30=9, which is reached at turn 30 after action at turn 29? Position at turn 30 is y30.\n\ny30 is set by action at turn 29.\n\ny30 = y29 + Δy29\n\ny30=9.\n\nSo y29 + Δy29 =9.\n\ny29 <=9, so possible if y29=9, Δy29=S; or y29=8, Δy29=U; or y29=10 impossible.\n\ny29 must be safe at T=29.\n\ny29=9: safe\n\ny29=8: freeway 8, dangerous at T=29, not safe.\n\nSo only y29=9, and Δy29=S, then y30=9.\n\nThen at turn 29, y29=9.\n\nBut y29 is set by action at turn 28.\n\ny29 = y28 + Δy28 =6 + Δy28\n\ny29 must be 9, so 6 + Δy28 =9, so Δy28=3? But |Δy| <=1, impossible.\n\ny29 =6 + Δy28, and |Δy28| <=1, so y29 can be 5,6,7.\n\nBut we need y29=9 for the above, which is impossible from y28=6 in one step.\n\nContradiction.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to reach y=9 by turn 31, i.e., in 3 actions.\n\nBecause to have y31=9, we need y30=9, which requires y29=9, but y29 cannot be 9 from y28=6 in one step.\n\nAnd y30=8 is not safe at T=30.\n\nSo no 3-action sequence possible.\n\nThus, minimal H is 4, as I had earlier.\n\nIn my sequence, with H=4, we reach at turn 32.\n\nNow, in that sequence, actions: turn 28: U, turn 29: S, turn 30: U, turn 31: U.\n\nBut at turn 31, action U, to y32=9.\n\nNow, we need to output actions from turn t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nH=4, so turns 28,29,30,31.\n\nActions: turn 28: U, turn 29: S, turn 30: U, turn 31: U.\n\nIn the answer format.\n\nBut let me confirm no collision.\n\nTurn 28: at position, y=6, action U. Collision at turn 28: y=6, freeway 6, not dangerous, safe.\n\nAfter action, y=7 for turn 29.\n\nTurn 29: at y=7, freeway 7. T=29, freeway 7 span [1,12], 0 not in, safe. Action S, so stay, y=7 for turn 30.\n\nTurn 30: at y=7, freeway 7. T=30, span [13,24], 0 not in, safe. Action U, so y=8 for turn 31.\n\nTurn 31: at y=8, freeway 8. T=31, span [1,12], 0 not in, safe.

H=4 is minimal, as we saw.\n\nPerhaps another sequence.\n\nFor example, at turn 28, go to y=7.\n\nThen at turn 29, instead of S, if we go down, but to y=6 at turn 30, dangerous.\n\nNot good.\n\nOr, at turn 28, stay, but at turn 29 y=6 dangerous.\n\nNo.\n\nOr, go to y=5? But y=5 at turn 29, freeway 5 dangerous.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo this seems optimal.\n\nIn freeway 5 and 6, there is a car that covers 0 at T=35, but since we reach by turn 32, no issue.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nSo I think this is fine.\n\nNow, output.\n\nAnswer format:\n\n\\boxed{ Turn 28: U Turn 29: S Turn 30: U Turn 31: U }\n\nBut in the sequence, it should be for t from 0 to H-1, but in the box, it's listed as Turn t_1: a_{t_1}, etc.\n\nAlso, in the car state, freeway 5 and 6 have multiple cars, but we handled.\n\nFreeway 7 and 8 at start, but we avoided.\n\nAnother thing: at turn 28, on freeway 6, but we moved immediately.\n\nI think it's correct.\n</think>\nTo reach the position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 6) at turn \\(t_1 = 28\\) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the sequence of actions must account for the car movements and collision conditions.\n\n### Collision Analysis for Freeways (at relevant turns):\n- **Freeway 1**: Never dangerous for \\(T \\geq 28\\).\n- **Freeway 2**: Dangerous at \\(T = 30\\).\n- **Freeway 3**: Dangerous at \\(T = 30\\).\n- **Freeway 4**: Dangerous at \\(T = 30\\).\n- **Freeway 5**: Dangerous at \\(T = 29\\) and \\(T = 30\\) (due to the second car covering \\(x=0\\)).\n- **Freeway 6**: Dangerous at \\(T = 29\\) and \\(T = 30\\) (due to the second car covering \\(x=0\\)).\n- **Freeway 7**: Dangerous at \\(T = 28\\) only (span \\([-11, 0]\\)), safe for \\(T \\geq 29\\).\n- **Freeway 8**: Dangerous at \\(T = 28\\), \\(T = 29\\), and \\(T = 30\\) (spans \\([-11, 0]\\), \\([-7, 4]\\), and \\([-3, 8]\\) respectively), safe for \\(T \\geq 31\\).\n\n### Minimal Path to \\(y = 9\\):\n- The minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\(y = 9\\) is 4, as a 3-turn sequence is impossible due to collision constraints and movement limits.\n- **Sequence**:\n  - **Turn 28 (current turn)**: Start at \\(y = 6\\) (freeway 6).

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,7) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible without colliding with any cars. The vertical positions are from 0 to 9, and I start at y=7. I need to reach y=9. The cars are on freeways y=1 to y=8, and I only care about collisions when I'm on a freeway, meaning when I'm at that y-position during a turn.\n\nThe collision rule says: collision occurs at turn T only if 0 is in the span of any car on freeway y_T. And y_T is my position at turn T.\n\nAlso, when I move, I'm not on the new freeway until the next turn. So if I move from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T I'm still on y, and at turn T+1 I'm on y+1.\n\nI start at turn t1=29, position (0,7).\n\nI need to go to y=9, which is the top, I think. y=9 is the goal, and there are no cars on y=9 since freeways are y=1 to 8, so once I reach y=9, I'm safe.\n\ny=0 might be the bottom, but I start at y=7, so I need to go up to y=9.\n\nThe moves: U increases y by 1, D decreases by 1, S stays.\n\ny must stay between 0 and 9 inclusive.\n\nNow, cars: they move left or right, and their positions change linearly with time.\n\nFor each freeway, I have car states.\n\nLet me list them clearly.\n\nFreeway 1: one car, head 72, tail 49, direction right, speed 24. Since direction right, span at t1 is [τ, h] = [49,72], and at time T, span is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] = [49 + 24(T-29), 72 + 24(T-29)]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nCollision if at turn T, I am on freeway k, and 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway at that turn.\n\nSince I'm at (0,y), and cars are on x-axis, but only x=0 matters for collision, I think.\n\nThe grid is 2D, but player is always at x=0, I assume, since it says position (0, y_t), so x is fixed at 0, and we move vertically? No.\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\n\"initial position (0, y_{t1})\" and \"reach (0,9)\", so player is always at x=0, moving vertically? But the freeways are horizontal, I think.\n\nThe freeways are at fixed y-levels, and cars move horizontally on them.\n\nPlayer is at (0, y), and y changes with actions.\n\nWhen player is at (0,y) at turn T, if y is between 1 and 8, and there is a car on freeway y such that at turn T, 0 is in its span, then collision.\n\ny=0 and y=9 might be safe, no cars.\n\ny=0: is it a freeway? Freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 should have no cars, so safe.\n\nIn this case, start at y=7, goal y=9.\n\nI need to go from y=7 to y=9, so probably up twice, but I have to avoid collisions at y=7 and y=8 when I'm there.\n\nBut at turn t1=29, I'm at y=7, so I might be at risk if there is a car on freeway 7 that covers x=0 at turn 29.\n\nSimilarly for other turns.\n\nFirst, let's check the current state at t1=29.\n\nt1=29.\n\nFreeway 1: k=1, cars: (72,49,right,24)\n\nSince right, span at t: [τ + s(t-t1), h + s(t-t1)] = [49 + 24(t-29), 72 + 24(t-29)]\n\nAt t=29, span = [49,72], so 0 is not in [49,72], so no collision at t=29 on y=1, but I'm not on y=1 now.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: (-12,-47,right,36)\n\nSpan at t: [-47 + 36(t-29), -12 + 36(t-29)]  // since tail τ, head h, for right, τ to h increasing.\n\nIn the rule: for right-moving, span(t1) = [τ, h], so at T, [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nHere τ = -47, h = -12, so at T, [ -47 + 36(T-29), -12 + 36(T-29) ]\n\nAt T=29, [ -47, -12], 0 not in, so ok.\n\nFreeway 3: same as 2, (-12,-47,right,36) probably typo? It says head and tail, but direction right, so span at t1 [τ,h] = [-47,-12], same as freeway 2.\n\nBut freeway 3 has the same car? Or multiple cars? No, for freeway 3, it says \"(-12,-47,right,36)\" same as freeway 2, but it's a different freeway, so different car I assume.\n\nSimilarly freeway 4 same.\n\nFreeway 5: multiple cars? It says \"(36,25,right,6), (0,-11,right,6), (-36,-47,right,6)\" so three cars on freeway 5.\n\nSimilarly freeway 6 same as 5.\n\nFreeway 7: (12,1,right,12)\n\nFreeway 8: (4,-7,right,4)\n\nNow, I start at y=7 at t=29.\n\nFirst, I need to see if at t=29, on freeway 7, is there a collision?\n\nFreeway 7: car (12,1,right,12)\n\nAt t=29, span = [1,12] since right, τ=1, h=12? Head and tail.\n\nIt says head h, tail τ.\n\nFor right-moving, span(t1) = [τ, h] = [1,12] at t1=29.\n\nSo [1,12], 0 not in, so no collision at t=29.\n\nSimilarly, for other freeways, but I'm only on y=7 now.\n\nNow, I need to go to y=9.\n\nThe shortest way would be to go up twice: U at t=29 and U at t=30, so at t=30 I would be at y=8, and t=31 at y=9.\n\nBut I need to check for collisions.\n\nAt each turn, when I am on a freeway y, I need that no car on that y has 0 in its span at that turn.\n\nFirst, at turn t=29, I am at y=7. Freeway 7 car: span [1,12], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nThen I move up: a_{t1} = U, so at turn t=30, I go to y=8? No.\n\nPlayer update: at turn t, I perform action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nLet's see the timing.\n\nAt turn t, I am at position y_t.\n\nI choose action a_t, which sets y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nThen at turn t+1, I am at y_{t+1}.\n\nCollision at turn T if at that position y_T, and for freeway y_T, if 0 in span of any car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nSo for turn T, I am at y_T, and I check cars on freeway y_T at time T.\n\nNow, for the sequence: I start at turn t1=29, y=7.\n\nI need to choose actions for t=29, t=30, etc., until I reach y=9 at some turn.\n\nLet H be the number of turns including the starting point? No.\n\nThe sequence is {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, and after H actions, at turn t1 + H, I should be at y=9? Let's see.\n\nAt turn t1, I am at y_{t1}.\n\nAfter action a_{t1}, I go to y_{t1 +1} = y_{t1} + Δy_{t1}\n\nThen at turn t1+1, I am at y_{t1+1}\n\n...\n\nAfter H actions, I have performed actions from t1 to t1+H-1, so I am at turn t1+H, position y_{t1+H}.\n\nAnd I want y_{t1+H} = 9.\n\nThe minimal H such that I reach y=9 at turn t1+H.\n\nSince I start at y=7, to reach y=9, I need to increase by 2, so minimum H=2, if I go up twice.\n\nBut I might need to wait or go down if there are obstacles.\n\nFirst, try H=2: actions at t=29 and t=30.\n\na_{29} and a_{30}, then at turn t=31, y_{31} should be 9.\n\ny_{t1+H} = y_{29 + H}\n\nAfter H actions, at turn 29 + H, position y_{29+H}.\n\nSet y_{29+H} =9.\n\nStart at y_{29} =7.\n\nIf I do U at t=29, then y_{30} =7 +1 =8\n\nThen if U at t=30, y_{31} =8+1=9, so at turn 31, y=9.\n\nH=2 actions: t=29 and t=30.\n\nNow, check collisions at each turn.\n\nAt turn 29: I am at y=7, position (0,7)\n\nFreeway y=7: car (12,1,right,12)\n\nAt t=29, span: [1,12], 0 not in, safe.\n\nI do a_{29} = U, so y_{30} =8.\n\nAt turn 30: I am at y=8.\n\nNow, check freeway y=8 at t=30.\n\nFreeway 8: car (4,-7,right,4)\n\nDirection right, so at time t, span [τ + s(t-t1), h + s(t-t1)] with t1=29, τ=-7, h=4, s=4.\n\nAt t=30, t-29=1, so span [ -7 + 4*1, 4 + 4*1] = [ -7+4, 4+4] = [-3, 8]\n\nNow, is 0 in [-3,8]? Yes, -3 ≤ 0 ≤ 8, so 0 is in the span, so collision at turn 30 if I am on y=8.\n\nBut at turn 30, I am at y=8, so collision occurs.\n\nTherefore, I cannot be at y=8 at turn 30.\n\nSo going directly up at t=29 to y=8 at turn 30 causes collision at turn 30.\n\nTherefore, H=2 is not possible with U,U.\n\nI could do different actions.\n\nFor example, at t=29, I could stay or go down, but I need to go up eventually.\n\nSince I need to reach y=9, and y=8 is blocked at t=30, I might wait or move to avoid.\n\nFirst, let's find when y=8 is safe.\n\nFreeway 8 car: span at time t: [ -7 + 4(t-29), 4 + 4(t-29) ]\n\nSet the span relative to time.\n\nLet τ = t - 29, so at time step τ from now.\n\nAt τ=0 (t=29), span [ -7, 4]? τ=-7, h=4, so [ -7, 4]\n\n0 in [-7,4]? -7 <=0<=4, yes, so at t=29, if I were on y=8, collision, but I'm not.\n\nAt τ=1 (t=30), [ -7+4, 4+4] = [-3,8], 0 in, collision.\n\nτ=2 (t=31): [ -7+8, 4+8] = [1,12], 0 not in? 1 to 12, 0<1, not in.\n\nτ=3: [ -7+12, 4+12] = [5,16], 0 not in.\n\nτ=4: [9,20], etc.\n\nSo at τ=2, t=31, span [1,12], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly, before τ=0, but t<29 not relevant.\n\nNow for y=7, freeway 7 car: (12,1,right,12)\n\nAt τ=0: [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nτ=1: [1+12,12+12]? s=12, t-29=τ.\n\nAt τ, span [ τ + s τ, h + s τ] = [1 + 12τ, 12 + 12τ]\n\nAt τ=0: [1,12]\n\nτ=1: [13,24], 0 not in.\n\nτ=2: [25,36], etc.\n\nAlways positive, so y=7 is always safe for this car, since min is 1 at τ=0.\n\nNow, I need to go to y=9.\n\ny=9 has no cars, so once I reach, I'm safe.\n\nBut to reach y=9, I need to be at y=8 at some point, and then move up.\n\nThe issue is when I am on y=8, it must be safe.\n\nFrom above, y=8 is only unsafe at τ=0 and τ=1, i.e., t=29 and t=30.\n\nAt t=31 (τ=2), it is safe.\n\nNow, I start at t=29, y=7.\n\nIf I do nothing at t=29, a_{29}=S, then y_{30}=7 (stay).\n\nThen at turn 30, I am at y=7, which is safe.\n\nThen I can do U at t=30, to go to y=8 at turn 31.\n\ny_{30} =7 (after S at t=29)\n\nThen a_{30}=U, so y_{31} =7 +1 =8\n\nAt turn 31, I am at y=8.\n\nNow, at t=31, τ=2, freeway 8 span [1,12], 0 not in, safe.\n\nThen I need to go to y=9. So at turn 31, I am at y=8, I do a_{31}=U, so y_{32}=9, and at turn 32, I am at y=9, goal.\n\nSo actions: t=29: S (stay), t=30: U, t=31: U.\n\nThen at turn 32, y=9.\n\nH=3 actions: from t=29 to t=31, and reach at turn t=29+3=32.\n\nt_{start} =29, actions at t=29,30,31, reach at t=32.\n\nMinimal H? H=3, but earlier H=2 not possible, so this might be minimal.\n\nBut perhaps I can do with H=2 in another way.\n\nFor example, at t=29, I go down to y=6? But that might be worse.\n\nOr go up at t=29 to y=8, but we saw collision at t=30.\n\nUnless I can be at y=8 at a different time.\n\nBut at t=29, if I go to y=8 immediately, I am at y=8 at turn 30, which is unsafe.\n\nIf I could be at y=8 at turn 31, which is safe.\n\nIn the above, with S at t=29, U at t=30, I am at y=8 at turn 31.\n\nThen U to y=9 at turn 32.\n\nI could go directly from y=7 to y=9? But I can only change by -1,0,1 each turn, so I need at least two moves to go from 7 to 9, so minimum two actions, but with the positions, I need to be at intermediate y.\n\nIn terms of turns, I need to be at y=8 at some turn to go up to 9.\n\nUnless I go from y=7 to y=8 at turn T, then to y=9 at turn T+1.\n\nSo I must be on y=8 at some turn, and at that turn, it must be safe.\n\nSimilarly, when I leave y=7, etc.\n\nBut in this case, the only unsafe times for y=8 are t=29 and t=30.\n\nt=29: at τ=0, span [-7,4], 0 in\n\nt=30: τ=1, span [-3,8], 0 in\n\nt=31: τ=2, span [1,12], 0 not in\n\nt=32: [5,16], etc.\n\nSo y=8 is safe only from t=31 onwards.\n\nSimilarly, y=7 is always safe.\n\nNow, I start at t=29, y=7.\n\nIf I go up at t=29, I arrive at y=8 at turn 30, which is unsafe.\n\nIf I stay at t=29, I remain at y=7 at turn 30, safe.\n\nThen at turn 30, I can go up to y=8 at turn 31, which is safe.\n\nThen at turn 31, I go up to y=9 at turn 32.\n\nSo H=3 actions.\n\nCould I go to another y-level to avoid? But I need to go to y=9, so I have to pass through y=8 eventually.\n\nUnless I go to y=9 directly, but I can't, since moves are ±1 or 0.\n\nSo I must visit y=8 at some point.\n\nThe earliest I can be at y=8 safely is t=31.\n\nAt t=29, I can stay or go down.\n\nBut going down might delay.\n\nFor example, at t=29, go down to y=6, then I need to come back, which takes more turns.\n\nSimilarly, going to other levels might have cars, but let's see if necessary.\n\nFirst, check other freeways for safety when passing.\n\nIn this path, I only visit y=7 and y=8.\n\ny=7 is always safe.\n\ny=8 is safe only at t=31 or later.\n\nIn the sequence: start t=29 y=7.\n\nAction S: stay, so at turn 30, y=7.\n\nAction U: move up, so at turn 31, y=8.\n\nThen action U: move up, at turn 32, y=9.\n\nAt turn 30, I am at y=7, freeway 7: at t=30, τ=1, span [1+12*1, 12+12*1]= [13,24], 0 not in, safe.\n\nAt turn 31, y=8, freeway 8 at t=31, τ=2, span [-7+4*2, 4+4*2]= [-7+8,4+8]= [1,12], 0 not in, safe.\n\nThen turn 32, y=9, no car, safe.\n\nSo this works with H=3.\n\nBut is there a way with H=2?\n\nSuppose I do something else.\n\nAt t=29, I go down to y=6.\n\nThen at turn 30, y=6.\n\nThen at t=30, I go up to y=7 at turn 31.\n\nBut I need to go to y=9, so I have to go up more, which takes more turns.\n\nFor example, from y=6 to y=7 to y=8 to y=9, three more actions, worse.\n\nAt t=29, go up to y=8, but at turn 30 y=8, collision, not possible.\n\nPerhaps I can be at y=8 at t=31 directly from y=7.\n\nBut to be at y=8 at turn 31, I need to be at y=7 or y=8 or y=9 at turn 30.\n\nIf at turn 30 I am at y=7, then U to y=8 at turn 31.\n\nIf at turn 30 I am at y=8, but at t=30 y=8 is unsafe.\n\nIf at turn 30 I am at y=9, but I start at y=7, to be at y=9 at turn 30, I need to go up twice in one turn, impossible.\n\nSo only possibility is to be at y=7 at turn 30, then U to y=8 at turn 31.\n\nThen to y=9 at turn 32.\n\nSo H=3 is minimal.\n\nBut let me confirm the car states.\n\nThere might be other cars that affect other levels.\n\nFor example, if I go to y=6 or something, but I don't need to.\n\nIn this case, only y=8 has a problem at early times.\n\nBut let me check freeway 6 and 5, since I might consider going through them.\n\nFor example, freeway 6: cars (36,25,right,6), (0,-11,right,6), (-36,-47,right,6)\n\nAt time t, for each car.\n\nFirst car: (36,25,right,6), span at τ: [25 + 6τ, 36 + 6τ]\n\nSecond car: (0,-11,right,6), span [ -11 + 6τ, 0 + 6τ] = [-11+6τ, 6τ]\n\nThird car: (-36,-47,right,6), span [-47+6τ, -36+6τ]\n\nNow, collision on y=6 if at some t, 0 in any span.\n\nFor example, second car, when -11+6τ <=0<=6τ, so 0<=6τ and -11+6τ <=0, so 6τ>=0 always for τ>=0, and -11+6τ<=0 implies 6τ<=11, τ<=11/6≈1.833, so τ=0,1.\n\nAt τ=0: [-11,0], 0 in? -11<=0<=0, yes, 0 is included.\n\nAt τ=1: [-11+6, 0+6] = [-5,6], 0 in.\n\nAt τ=2: [-11+12,12] = [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, other cars: first car min at τ=0 is 25>0, so never 0.\n\nThird car max at τ=0 is -36<0, and increasing, but at τ=6, [-47+36, -36+36]=[-11,0], 0 in, but for now, τ small.\n\nBut for y=6, at τ=0 and τ=1, second car covers 0.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 5 same as 6, since same cars.\n\nFreeway 5: identical to 6.\n\nBut I don't plan to go there.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 1,2,3,4 have cars far away.\n\nFreeway 1: [49+24τ,72+24τ], min 49>0, safe.\n\nFreeway 2: [-47+36τ, -12+36τ], at τ=0: [-47,-12], 0 not in; τ=1: [-11,24], -11<=0<=24? 0 in? -11<=0<=24 yes.\n\n-11 <=0 <=24, yes.\n\nAt τ=1, t=30, span [-47+36, -12+36]= [-11,24], 0 in.\n\nSimilarly, τ=0: [-47,-12], 0 not in, since -12<0? -12 <=0? But 0 not less than or equal to -12? Span [τ, h] for right, so if τ <= h, and 0 in if τ <=0<=h.\n\nAt τ=0, τ=-47, h=-12, so -47 <=0<= -12? 0 <= -12 is false, so 0 not in [-47,-12].\n\nSimilarly, τ=1: [-47+36, -12+36]= [-11,24], -11<=0<=24 true, so 0 in.\n\nτ=2: [-47+72, -12+72]= [25,60], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3 and 4 same.\n\nBut again, I don't go to y=2,3,4.\n\nFreeway 7 and 8 we have.\n\nIn my plan, I only go through y=7 and y=8 at safe times.\n\nWith H=3.\n\nBut let me see if I can reach faster by going to y=9 at turn 31.\n\nTo be at y=9 at turn 31, I need y_{31}=9.\n\ny_{31} = y_{30} + Δy_{30}\n\ny_{30} = y_{29} + Δy_{29} =7 + Δy_{29}\n\nSo y_{31} =7 + Δy_{29} + Δy_{30}\n\nSet equal to 9, so Δy_{29} + Δy_{30} =2.\n\nEach Δy is -1,0,1, so possible only if both U, so Δy_{29}=1, Δy_{30}=1.\n\nThen y_{30} =7+1=8, y_{31}=8+1=9.\n\nBut at turn 30, y=8, which we have collision as above.\n\nIf I do U and U, at turn 30 y=8, unsafe.\n\nNo other way to get to y=9 at turn 31.\n\nSo impossible with H=2.\n\nThus minimal H=3.\n\nNow, sequence: actions at t=29, t=30, t=31.\n\nWith a_{29}=S, a_{30}=U, a_{31}=U.\n\nThen at turn 32, y=9.\n\nIn the sequence, {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nt1=29, H=3, so t from 0 to 2, so a_{29+0}=a_{29}, a_{29+1}=a_{30}, a_{29+2}=a_{31}.\n\nAnd after that, at turn t1+H=32, y=9.\n\nNow, in the answer, it should be:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}  which is a_{29}\n\nTurn t_1 +1: a_{t_1 +1} = a_{30}\n\nTurn t_1 +2: a_{t_1 +2} = a_{31}\n\nWith actions S, U, U.\n\nBut let me confirm the car on freeway 7 when I stay.\n\nAt turn 30, I am at y=7, freeway 7 car: at t=30, τ=1, span [1+12*1, 12+12*1]= [13,24], 0 not in, safe.\n\nAt turn 31, y=8, freeway 8: at t=31, τ=2, span [-7+4*2, 4+4*2]= [-7+8,4+8]= [1,12], 0 not in, safe.\n\nGood.\n\nPerhaps I could go up immediately but to a different time.\n\nSuppose at t=29, I go up to y=8, but since at turn 30 I would be on y=8 with collision, I cannot.\n\nUnless the collision rule has a nuance.\n\nThe note says: if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you are not considered on y_{T+1} at turn T, so not collided by cars on y_{T+1} at turn T.\n\nBut in this case, when I move at turn T, I am on y_T at turn T, and y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nFor example, at turn T, I am at y_T, I choose a_T, which sets y_{T+1}.\n\nAt turn T, I am on freeway y_T.\n\nIf I move to different y, at turn T, I am not on y_{T+1}, so cars on y_{T+1} at turn T don't affect me, only cars on y_T at turn T.\n\nIn the collision at turn T, only freeway y_T matters.\n\nIn my earlier case, when I go U at t=29, I am at y=7 at turn 29, safe.\n\nThen at turn 30, I am at y=8, and cars on y=8 at turn 30 affect me, which caused collision.\n\nNo way around.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=8 at turn 31 directly from y=7 by waiting, but I have to be at y=7 at turn 30.\n\nSo I think H=3 is minimal.\n\nNow, about the other freeways, but since I don't visit them, no issue.\n\nFor example, freeway 5 or 6, but I stay at y=7 and go to y=8.\n\ny=7 and y=8 are freeways 7 and 8.\n\nFreeway 7 is y=7, freeway 8 is y=8.\n\nIn the list, freeway k for y=k, I assume.\n\nYes.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nSo minimal H=3, actions: S at t=29, U at t=30, U at t=31.\n\nIn the sequence: a_{29} = S, a_{30} = U, a_{31} = U.\n\nNow, to write in the answer format.\n\nBut the player position: at turn 29: (0,7), after S, still (0,7) but at turn 30 position.\n\nTurn 29: action a_{29}, after which y_{30} set.\n\nBut position at turn is before action? I think.\n\nStandard: at turn t, position y_t, perform action a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nThen at turn t+1, position y_{t+1}.\n\nCollision checked at each turn based on y_t.\n\nIn this case, for turn 29, y=7, safe.\n\nAction S, so y_{30}=7.\n\nTurn 30, y=7, safe.\n\nAction U, so y_{31}=8.\n\nTurn 31, y=8, safe (at t=31).\n\nAction U, y_{32}=9.\n\nTurn 32, y=9, no car.\n\nPerfect.\n\nNow, answer should be:\n\n\\boxed{ Turn t_1: S \\\\ Turn t_1 + 1: U \\\\ Turn t_1 + 2: U }\n\nSince t_1=29.\n\nIn the format, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc.\n\nSo for t_1=29.\n\nBut in the box, I think we use t_1.\n\nAlso, H=3.\n\nBut let me see if I can do it in H=2 by going through another level, but I don't think so.\n\nFor example, at t=29, go down to y=6, but at y=6, might be unsafe.\n\nAt t=29, if I go to y=6, at turn 30 I am at y=6.\n\nFreeway 6: at t=30, τ=1, cars: first [25+6*1,36+6*1]=[31,42], no\n\nSecond [-11+6*1, 0+6*1]=[-5,6], 0 in, so if I am on y=6 at turn 30, collision.\n\nAt t=29, if I were on y=6, at τ=0, second car [-11,0], 0 in, collision.\n\nBut I start at y=7.\n\nIf I go down at t=29 to y=6, at turn 30 I arrive at y=6.\n\nAt turn 30, y=6, freeway 6 at t=30, τ=1, second car span [-5,6], 0 in, collision.\n\nSimilarly, unsafe.\n\nTo be safe on y=6, need to avoid when second car covers 0.\n\nFrom above, second car covers 0 when τ=0 and τ=1, t=29 and t=30.\n\nAt τ=2, t=31, [ -11+12, 12]= [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, other cars no issue.\n\nBut at t=31, y=6 safe, but I need to go to y=9, which takes more turns.\n\nFor example, at t=31, y=6, then go up to y=7 at t=32, y=8 at t=33, y=9 at t=34, too long.\n\nNot better.\n\nSimilarly, other levels might have issues.\n\nSo best is to stay and go up at safe time.\n\nThus, minimal H=3.\n\nSo the sequence is S at t_1, U at t_1+1, U at t_1+2.\n\nNow, in the answer format.\n</think>\nThe goal is to reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 7) at turn \\(t_1 = 29\\) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\), avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis:\n- The player starts at \\((0, 7)\\) at turn 29.\n- To reach \\((0, 9)\\), the player must increase their \\(y\\)-coordinate by 2. Since each action changes \\(y\\) by at most 1, a minimum of 2 actions (e.g., two \"U\" actions) is theoretically possible, but collisions must be avoided.\n- Collision occurs at turn \\(T\\) if the player is on freeway \\(y_T\\) (where \\(1 \\leq y_T \\leq 8\\)) and \\(x = 0\\) is within the span of any car on that freeway at turn \\(T\\).\n\n#### Car States at Turn 29:\n- **Freeway 7 (\\(y = 7\\)):** Car at \\((12, 1, \\text{right}, 12)\\)  \n  Span at turn \\(T\\): \\([1 + 12(T - 29), 12 + 12(T - 29)]\\)  \n  At \\(T = 29\\): \\([1, 12]\\), 0 not in span → safe.  \n  At \\(T = 30\\): \\([13, 24]\\), 0 not in span → safe.  \n  Always safe for \\(T \\geq 29\\) since min \\(y = 1 > 0\\).\n\n- **Freeway 8 (\\(y = 8\\)):** Car at \\((4, -7, \\text{right}, 4)\\)  \n  Span at turn \\(T\\): \\([-7 + 4(T - 29), 4 + 4(T - 29)]\\)  \n  At \\(T = 29\\): \\([-7, 4]\\), 0 in span (since \\(-7 \\leq 0 \\leq 4\\)) → unsafe.  \n  At \\(T = 30\\): \\([-3, 8]\\), 0 in span (since \\(-3 \\leq 0 \\leq 8\\)) → unsafe.  \n  At \\(T = 31\\): \\([1, 12]\\), 0 not in span → safe.  \n  Safe for \\(T \\geq 31\\).\n\n- Other freeways (e.g., \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 6\\)) are not relevant as the player only needs to pass through \\(y = 7\\) and \\(y = 8\\) to reach \\(y = 9\\).\n\n#### Direct Path (H=2) Not Feasible:\n- If actions are \\(a_{29} = U\\) and \\(a_{30} = U\\):  \n  - At turn 29: Player at \\(y = 7\\), safe (as above).  \n    After \\(U\\), \\(y_{30} = 8\\).  \n  - At turn 30: Player at \\(y = 8\\). Freeway 8 span at \\(T=30\\) is \\([-3, 8]\\), which contains 0 → collision.  \n  Thus, \\(H=2\\) with \\(U, U\\) is impossible due to collision at turn 30.\n\n#### Minimal Path with H=3:\n- To avoid collision on \\(y = 8\\), the player must be on \\(y = 8\\) at a safe turn (\\(T \\geq 31\\)).  \n- Sequence:  \n  - **Turn 29 (\\(t_1\\)):** Action \\(S\\) (stay).  \n    - Player remains at \\(y = 7\\).  \n    - At turn 29: \\(y = 7\\), freeway 7 span \\([1, 12]\\) safe.  \n    - After \\(S\\), \\(y_{30} = 7\\).  \n  - **Turn 30 (\\(t_1 + 1\\)):** Action \\(U\\) (up).  \n    - Player moves to \\(y = 8\\).  \n    - At turn 30: Player at \\(y = 7\\), freeway 7 span at \\(T=30\\) is \\([13, 24]\\) (safe).  \n    - After \\(U\\), \\(y_{31} = 8\\).  \n  - **Turn 31 (\\(t_1 + 2\\)):** Action \\(U\\) (up).  \n    - Player moves to \\(y = 9\\).  \n    - At turn 31: Player at \\(y = 8\\), freeway 8 span at \\(T=31\\) is \\([1, 12]\\) (safe).  \n    - After \\(U\\), \\(y_{32} = 9\\).  \n- At turn 32, player is at \\((0, 9)\\), which has no cars and is safe.\n\nThis sequence uses \\(H = 3\\) actions and reaches the goal at turn 32. Since \\(H = 2\\) is impossible due to collisions, \\(H = 3\\) is minimal.\n\n### Answer:\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 3, with the sequence of actions:\n- Turn \\(t_1\\): \\(S\\)  \n- Turn \\(t_1 + 1\\): \\(U\\)  \n- Turn \\(t_1 + 2\\): \\(U\\)\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } t_1\\text{: } S \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 1\\text{: } U \\\\ \\text{Turn } t_1 + 2\\text{: } U }",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,7) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The player moves vertically: up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing y by +1, -1, or 0, and y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars move horizontally on their freeways. For each car, I have its position at turn t1=30, given by head and tail, and direction and speed. The span is the interval it occupies, and it moves left or right based on direction.\n\nCollision happens only if at some turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there's a car such that 0 (the x-position where the player is) is within the car's span at that turn T.\n\nAlso, importantly, when you move to a new freeway, you're not on that new freeway until the next turn. So if at turn T you're on y_T and move to y_{T+1}, at turn T you're still on y_T, so you only check for cars on y_T at turn T. At turn T+1, you're on y_{T+1}, so you check cars there.\n\nThe goal is to reach y=9 from y=7, so I need to go up twice, but I have to avoid the freeways when cars are at x=0.\n\ny=9 is the target, and it's not a freeway with cars; cars are on y=1 to 8. So y=0 and y=9 are safe, I assume, no cars there.\n\nNow, current position is (0,7) at turn 30. So at turn 30, I'm on y=7, and I need to check if there's a collision now? But the task is to find actions starting from turn t1=30 to move to (0,9), so I think at turn 30, I'm already at (0,7), and I need to take actions for future turns.\n\nThe sequence is {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, so a_{t1} is the first action, which will determine y_{t1+1}, and so on.\n\nLet me denote the turns: let τ be the number of turns after t1. So at τ=0, turn t1, position is (0,7). After action a_{t1}, at τ=1, turn t1+1, position is (0, y_{t1+1}), and so on, up to when y =9.\n\nH is the number of turns, including the starting point? No, the sequence of actions from t=0 to H-1, so after H actions, we are at turn t1 + H, and y_{t1+H} should be 9.\n\nLet's read: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and \"reach (0,9)\".\n\nAfter H actions, we have applied a_{t1} to a_{t1+H-1}, so we are at turn t1 + H, and position should be (0,9).\n\ny_{t1} =7, and after H actions, y_{t1+H} =9.\n\nEach action changes y, so to go from 7 to 9, I need at least two up actions, but I might have to wait or something to avoid cars.\n\nMinimal H might be 2 if I can go up twice directly, but I need to check if there are cars on the paths.\n\nFirst, I need to simulate the car positions for future turns.\n\nCars are on freeways 1 to 8, and for each, I have their state at t1=30.\n\nThe car update: for a car, at turn T, span is [head - s(T-t1), tail - s(T-t1)] for left-moving? Let's see the rule.\n\nFrom the problem:\n\nLeft-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nIn the notation, head and tail, but for left-moving, if head is left or right? The span is given as (head, tail), but direction indicates which way it's moving.\n\nFor left-moving, it says Span(t1) = [h, τ] and moves to [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT], so if it's moving left, h should be the right end, I think? Let's see.\n\nSuppose at t1, span is [h, τ], and it moves left, so positions decrease. So if [h, τ] with h > τ, then as it moves left, both decrease, so the span shifts left.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] → [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT], so here [τ, h] with τ < h, I assume, and it increases.\n\nIn the input, for each car, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nBut head and tail might not be in order; I think we need to interpret based on direction.\n\nFor example, freeway 1: (-48, -71, right, 24)\n\nDirection right, so it should be moving right. For right-moving, the span is given as (τ, h)? No.\n\nLook: for right-moving, it says \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\" → [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT]\n\nAnd in the input, it's listed as (head, tail, ...), but here it says head and tail, but in the span definition for right, it uses τ and h.\n\nI think there might be inconsistency.\n\nIn the car state table, it says \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nThen for update:\n\nIf left-moving, Span(t1) = [h, τ] → [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT]\n\nIf right-moving, Span(t1) = [τ, h] → [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT]\n\nBut for left-moving, if h and τ are given, and direction left, Span(t1) = [h, τ], which might have h < τ or h > τ, but since it's an interval, [min, max] I assume? No, the way it's written, it might not be sorted.\n\nFor example, freeway 1: (-48, -71, right, 24)\n\nDirection right, so for right-moving, Span(t1) = [τ, h] = [-71, -48]? But tail τ=-71, head h=-48, so [τ, h] = [-71, -48], which from -71 to -48, so min to max, and moving right, so at T, [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] = [-71 + 24ΔT, -48 + 24ΔT]\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, but there are no left-moving cars here; all are right-moving.\n\nLet's list all cars:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (head -48, tail -71, right, 24) so for right, span at t1: [τ, h] = [-71, -48]\n\nFreeway 2: (24, -11, right, 36) → [τ, h] = [-11, 24]\n\nFreeway 3: same as 2? (24, -11, right, 36) → [-11, 24]\n\nFreeway 4: same, (24, -11, right, 36) → [-11, 24]\n\nFreeway 5: three cars: (42,31,right,6), (6,-5,right,6), (-30,-41,right,6)\n\nFor each, right-moving.\n\nFirst car: (h=42, τ=31, right,6) → span [τ,h] = [31,42]\n\nSecond: (h=6, τ=-5, right,6) → [τ,h] = [-5,6]\n\nThird: (h=-30, τ=-41, right,6) → [τ,h] = [-41,-30]\n\nFreeway 6: same as 5: (42,31,right,6), (6,-5,right,6), (-30,-41,right,6) so spans [31,42], [-5,6], [-41,-30]\n\nFreeway 7: (24,13,right,12) → [τ,h] = [13,24]? Head=24, tail=13, so [13,24]\n\nFreeway 8: (8,-3,right,4) → [τ,h] = [-3,8]\n\nAll cars are right-moving, so all spans are increasing intervals.\n\nNow, for collision: at turn T, if player is on freeway y, then for that freeway, if there is a car such that 0 is in [c_low(T), c_high(T)] for that car's span at T.\n\nSpan at T for a car: for right-moving, [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nSimilarly for left, but all right here.\n\nt1=30.\n\nNow, player starts at y=7 at turn t1=30.\n\nAt turn T, player position y_T depends on actions.\n\nWe need to find actions to go to y=9.\n\ny=7 to y=9, so minimum two U actions.\n\nBut I need to avoid being on a freeway when a car covers x=0 at that turn.\n\nAlso, since I start at y=7, at turn t1=30, I am on y=7, so I need to check if there is a car on freeway 7 at t=30 with 0 in its span.\n\nFreeway 7: car at t1: [13,24] with s=12, right-moving.\n\nAt T=30, ΔT=0, span [13,24], 0 is not in [13,24], so no collision at t=30.\n\nSimilarly, for other freeways, but I'm only on y=7 at t=30.\n\nNow, I need to move up to y=8 and then to y=9.\n\ny=8 is a freeway with cars.\n\nFreeway 8: one car: at t1, [τ, h] = [-3,8] with s=4.\n\nAt turn T, span: [-3 + 4(T-30), 8 + 4(T-30)]\n\nSimilarly, y=7: car [13 + 12(T-30), 24 + 12(T-30)]\n\ny=6: three cars, but I might not go there, but I need to consider if I stay or move.\n\nSince I need to go up, from 7 to 8 to 9, I probably will be on y=8 at some point.\n\ny=9 has no cars, so when I reach y=9, no collision possible.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 has no cars, but I'm at 7.\n\nNow, minimal H: I can try to go up immediately.\n\nSuppose at turn t1=30, I take action U, so y_{31} = 7 +1 =8.\n\nAt turn 31, I am on y=8.\n\nThen I need to take another action to go to y=9.\n\nBut at turn 31, on y=8, I need to check if there is collision, i.e., if for freeway 8, at turn 31, 0 is in some car's span.\n\nFreeway 8 car: at T=31, ΔT=1, span: [-3 + 4(1), 8 + 4(1)] = [-3+4, 8+4] = [1,12]\n\n0 is not in [1,12], so safe.\n\nThen at turn 31, I can take U, go to y=9 at turn 32.\n\nThen at turn 32, on y=9, no cars, so I reached in H=2 turns: actions at t=30 and t=31.\n\nBut is that correct? H actions from t=0 to H-1, so two actions: a_{30} and a_{31}, and at turn 32, y=9.\n\nBut let me confirm the collision rule.\n\nAt turn 31, I am on y=8, and car span is [1,12], 0 not in, so ok.\n\nAt turn 32, on y=9, no issue.\n\nBut is there a problem at other points?\n\nPerhaps I should check if I can do it faster, but H=2 seems possible.\n\nBut let me see the other freeways; maybe I need to consider if I stay or something, but going directly seems fine.\n\nBut freeway 8 has only one car, and at T=31, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nAt T=30, when I was on y=7, car on y=7: at T=30, [13,24], 0 not in.\n\nSo seems no collision.\n\nBut the player is at x=0 always, only y changes.\n\nBut in the car span, we care about x=0.\n\nNow, but there are multiple cars on some freeways, like y=5 and y=6, but since I'm not going there, I don't care.\n\ny=8 has only one car, which is fine.\n\nBut let me double-check the car on y=8.\n\nFreeway 8: (head=8, tail=-3, direction right, speed=4) at t1=30.\n\nSpan at t1: [τ, h] = [-3,8]\n\nAt turn T, [ -3 + 4(T-30), 8 + 4(T-30) ]\n\nAt T=31: [ -3+4, 8+4] = [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nAt T=32: [ -3+8, 8+8] = [5,16], etc.\n\nAll good.\n\nSimilarly, for y=7, car: (head=24, tail=13, right,12) span at t1: [13,24]\n\nAt T=30: [13,24]\n\nAt T=31: [13+12,24+12]= [25,36], 0 not in.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, I can go U at t=30 to y=8 at turn 31, then U at t=31 to y=9 at turn 32.\n\nH=2 turns.\n\nBut the answer should be for turns starting from t1.\n\nSequence: Turn 30: U\n\nTurn 31: U\n\nAnd done.\n\nBut is there any reason I cannot? For example, if at some point the car covers x=0.\n\nBut at the turns I'm on the freeway, it doesn't.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider if I stay on y=7 or something, but I don't need to.\n\nAnother thing: when I move to y=8 at turn 31, at turn 30 I was on y=7, so at turn 30, I only care about y=7 cars, which is fine.\n\nAt turn 31, on y=8, care about y=8 cars, which at T=31, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo should be fine.\n\nBut let me check freeway 5 and 6, but I'm not going there.\n\ny=6 has cars, but I'm at y=7,8,9.\n\nPerhaps the problem is that I might need to go through other lanes if direct is blocked, but here it's not blocked.\n\nBut let me see if at other times, cars might be at x=0 on other freeways, but since I'm not there, it doesn't matter.\n\nFor example, on y=8, when does the car cover x=0?\n\nThe car span includes x=0 when min <=0 <= max.\n\nFor freeway 8 car: [ -3 +4ΔT, 8 +4ΔT ] contains 0 when -3 +4ΔT <=0 <= 8 +4ΔT\n\nSince 8+4ΔT >0 always, so when -3 +4ΔT <=0, i.e., 4ΔT <=3, ΔT <= 0.75, so for ΔT=0, -3<=0 true, but at ΔT=0, T=30, span [-3,8], which includes 0? -3 <=0 <=8, yes, 0 is in [-3,8].\n\nAt turn T=30, for freeway 8, car span is [-3,8], and 0 is between -3 and 8, so 0 is in the span.\n\nBut at turn T=30, I am not on y=8; I am on y=7.\n\nAt turn T=30, player is at y=7, so I only check cars on y=7, not on y=8.\n\nSimilarly, at turn T=31, when I am on y=8, span is [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nIf I were on y=8 at T=30, I would collide, but I'm not.\n\nSo for the path, it should be fine.\n\nBut let me confirm with another freeway.\n\nSay freeway 2: at t1, [ -11,24] s=36\n\nContains 0 when -11 +36ΔT <=0 <=24+36ΔT\n\n-11 +36ΔT <=0 => ΔT <= 11/36 ≈0.305, so only at ΔT=0, T=30, but at T=30, on y=2, if I were there, but I'm not.\n\nSimilarly, other cars.\n\nFor example, freeway 5, first car [31,42] s=6, never contains 0 since min=31>0.\n\nSecond car [-5,6] s=6, contains 0 when -5+6ΔT <=0 <=6+6ΔT\n\n-5+6ΔT <=0 => ΔT <=5/6≈0.833, so for ΔT=0, -5<=0<=6 true, and ΔT=1, -5+6=1>0? At ΔT=0, min=-5<=0, max=6>=0, so 0 in.\n\nAt ΔT=1, min=-5+6=1>0, max=6+6=12>0, min=1>0, so 0 not in [1,12].\n\nSimilarly, only at ΔT=0, 0 is in for that car on y=5.\n\nBut again, I'm not on y=5 at T=30.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nTherefore, for my plan, it should work.\n\nBut the player starts at (0,7) at turn 30, and I take action at turn 30 to go up to y=8 at turn 31.\n\nThen at turn 31, action to go to y=9 at turn 32.\n\nReached in 2 turns.\n\nBut is there a constraint that I have to reach exactly at turn or something? No.\n\nPerhaps I should output the sequence.\n\nBut let me see the answer format.\n\nIt should be:\n\nTurn 30: U\n\nTurn 31: U\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut the turn is t1=30, so Turn t1: U, Turn t1+1: U.\n\nBut H=2.\n\nBut let me see if I can do it in one turn? From y=7 to y=9 in one action? But actions only change y by at most 1, so impossible. Min H=2.\n\nPerhaps stay and then go, but that would be more turns.\n\nSo H=2 should be minimal.\n\nBut why do I feel like there might be a problem? Let me see freeway 8 again.\n\nFreeway 8 car: at T=30, span [-3,8], includes 0.\n\nIf I were to be on y=8 at T=30, I would collide, but I'm not.\n\nAt T=31, I am on y=8, span [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nIf I go to y=8 at T=31, it's fine.\n\nPerhaps I can go down or something, but that would take longer to go to 9.\n\nFor example, if I go down to y=6, but y=6 has cars, and I need to go up eventually, so more turns.\n\nNo need.\n\nPerhaps at some turn, if I stay on y=7, but car on y=7 at T=31 is [25,36], 0 not in, so I could stay, but why stay? I want to go up.\n\nSo direct up is fine.\n\nAnother thing: the note says \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T\", which we already used.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n\nBut let me check for turn 31 on y=8.\n\nAt turn 31, ΔT=1, freeway 8 car: [ -3 +4*1, 8+4*1] = [1,12], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nThen to y=9.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if on y=9, but no cars.\n\ny=9 is not a freeway with cars, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=0.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nBut the problem has multiple cars on some freeways, like y=5 and y=6, but I don't care.\n\nFreeway 6 has the same as 5, but not relevant.\n\nPerhaps I need to output the sequence.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 5 and 6, it has multiple cars, but for my path, only y=7 and y=8 matter.\n\ny=7 I am at T=30, and y=8 at T=31.\n\nBoth safe.\n\nSo minimal H=2.\n\nSequence: a_{30} = U, a_{31} = U.\n\nNow, in the answer format.\n\nSo:\n\n\\boxed{  \nTurn 30: U  \nTurn 31: U  \n}\n\nBut let me write it properly.\n\nTurn t1: a_{t1} etc.\n\nSince t1=30.\n\nPerhaps I should use t1.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut in the format, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc.\n\nSo for the answer.\n\nBut I think it's fine.\n\nBut I recall that for freeway 8, at T=30, the car covers x=0, but I'm not there.\n\nSimilarly, for other freeways at different times.\n\nFor example, on y=8, the car covers x=0 only at T=30, since at T=31, min=1>0.\n\nSimilarly, on y=7, car covers x=0 only if [13+12ΔT, 24+12ΔT] contains 0.\n\n13+12ΔT <=0 <=24+12ΔT\n\nBut 13+12ΔT >0 for ΔT>=0, since min=13>0, so never contains 0. So y=7 is always safe for this car.\n\nSimilarly, y=8 car covers x=0 only at ΔT=0, T=30.\n\nBut since I'm on y=8 at T=31, not at T=30, so ok.\n\nTherefore, no issue.\n\nSo I think the answer is H=2 with U at turn 30 and U at turn 31.\n\nBut let me confirm the turns.\n\nAt turn 30: position (0,7), take action U, so at turn 31, position (0,8)\n\nAt turn 31: take action U, so at turn 32, position (0,9)\n\nReached.\n\nCollision: at turn 30, on y=7, car on y=7: span [13,24] at T=30, 0 not in.\n\nAt turn 31, on y=8, car on y=8: span at T=31, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nAt turn 32, on y=9, no cars.\n\nAll good.\n\nSo minimal turns.\n\nBut is there a way with H=1? No, because from 7 to 9, need at least two steps.\n\nIf I could jump, but no, only +1, -1, 0.\n\nSo H=2 is minimal.\n\nTherefore, the sequence should be:\n\nTurn 30: U\n\nTurn 31: U\n\nNow, for the box.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn t_1: U\nTurn t_1 + 1: U\n}\n\nSince t1=30.\n\nBut to be precise.\n\nPerhaps write the turns.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nBut the user said \"current turn is \\{t_1\\}\" and t1=30.\n\nSo in the answer, I can use t1.\n\nBut in the box, it should be the actions.\n\nSo I think:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 30: U \\\\\nTurn 31: U\n}\n\nor with t1.\n\nSince the problem says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc.\n\nBut to be consistent.\n\nIn the task, it says \"Answer Format\" with Turn t_1: etc.\n\nSo probably:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn t_1: U \\\\\nTurn t_1 + 1: U\n}\n\nYes.\n\nAnd H=2.\n\nBut in the sequence, it's for t=0 to H-1, so two actions.\n\nNow, I think that's it.\n\nBut I have a doubt because freeway 8 has a car that covers x=0 at t=30, and if I were to go to y=8 at t=30, but I can't, since I start at y=7.\n\nPerhaps if I do nothing at t=30, then at t=31 I am still on y=7, then go to y=8 at t=32, but that would take more turns.\n\nFor example, if at t=30 I stay, y=7, then at t=31 I go U to y=8 at t=32, then at t=32 I need to go U to y=9 at t=33, so H=3, worse.\n\nNo need.\n\nAt t=30, if I go U, to y=8 at t=31, as before.\n\nBut at t=31 on y=8, it's safe.\n\nPerhaps on other freeways, but not.\n\nAnother thing: the player can move down, but that would increase H.\n\nSo no.\n\nTherefore, I think it's correct.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 7) at turn \\(t_1 = 30\\). The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis:\n- The player must move from \\(y = 7\\) to \\(y = 9\\), requiring at least two \"U\" (up) actions, as each action changes \\(y\\) by at most \\(\\pm 1\\).\n- Collision occurs only if, at turn \\(T\\), the player is on a freeway \\(y_T\\) and a car on that freeway has a span containing \\(x = 0\\).\n- At turn \\(t_1 = 30\\), the player is on \\(y = 7\\). The car on freeway 7 has a span of \\([13, 24]\\) at \\(T = 30\\), which does not contain 0, so no collision occurs.\n- To reach \\(y = 9\\), the player can take the following actions:\n  - At turn 30: action \\(U\\), moving to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 31.\n  - At turn 31: action \\(U\\), moving to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 32.\n- At turn 31, the player is on \\(y = 8\\). The car on freeway 8 has a span at \\(T = 31\\) of \\([-3 + 4(31-30), 8 + 4(31-30)] = [1, 12]\\), which does not contain 0, so no collision occurs.\n- At turn 32, the player is on \\(y = 9\\), where there are no cars, so the position is safe.\n\nThis sequence reaches the goal in \\(H = 2\\) turns, which is minimal since moving from \\(y = 7\\) to \\(y = 9\\) requires at least two steps.\n\n### Car Position Verification (for completeness):\n- **Freeway 7 (at relevant turns):**\n  - At \\(T = 30\\): span \\([13, 24]\\), 0 not in span.\n  - At \\(T = 31\\): span \\([13 + 12(1), 24 + 12(1)] = [25, 36]\\), 0 not in span (player not on freeway 7 at \\(T = 31\\)).\n- **Freeway 8 (at relevant turns):**\n  - At \\(T = 30\\): span \\([-3, 8]\\), contains 0, but player not on freeway 8 at \\(T = 30\\).\n  - At \\(T = 31\\): span \\([-3 + 4(1), 8 + 4(1)] = [1, 12]\\), 0 not in span.\n- Other freeways are irrelevant as the player only occupies \\(y = 7\\) and \\(y = 8\\) during the sequence.\n\n### Action Sequence:\n- The sequence of actions starts at turn \\(t_1 = 30\\) and consists of \\(H = 2\\) actions: \\(a_{30}\\) and \\(a_{31}\\).\n- Actions: \\(U\\) at turn 30 and \\(U\\) at turn 31.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 30: U \\\\\nTurn 31: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,8) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways. The player can move up, down, or stay each turn, changing the y-position by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nThe goal is to reach y=9, which is the top row. Currently, at turn t₁=31, the player is at y=8. So from y=8, to get to y=9, I might only need to move up once, but I have to make sure that when I move, I don't collide with a car on the freeway I'm moving to or from, but according to the collision rule, collision only happens if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T and for that freeway, there's a car where the x=0 is within the car's span at that turn.\n\nThe collision rule says: collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T. And note that if you move to a different y at turn T, you're not considered on that new y until the next turn. Let me read carefully.\n\n\"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nSo at turn T, you are on freeway y_T. If you choose an action that changes y, then at turn T, you are still on y_T, and only cars on y_T can collide with you at that turn. After the move, at turn T+1, you are on y_{T+1}, and then cars on y_{T+1} can collide with you if 0 is in their span.\n\nIn this case, since we're moving vertically, and cars are on fixed freeways, for each turn, your y-position determines which freeway you're on, and you need to check for cars on that specific freeway at that turn.\n\nNow, the player starts at y=8 at turn 31. y=8 is a freeway, and there's a car on freeway 8: (12, 1, right, 4)\n\nFirst, I need to understand the car positions and how they move.\n\nThe car update: for left-moving, span changes as [h - s Δt, τ - s Δt], for right-moving, [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt], where Δt = T - t₁.\n\nt₁ is the current turn, 31.\n\nSo for any future turn T, Δt = T - 31.\n\nNow, collision happens at turn T if for the freeway y_T, there is a car such that 0 is in the span at that turn.\n\nFor a car, the span is the interval it occupies.\n\nFor right-moving cars, the span is [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt], and since it's right-moving, h is the head, τ is tail, so h > τ, I assume, so the span is from left to right, increasing x.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but here all cars seem to be right-moving, from the data.\n\nLet's list all cars:\n\nFreeway 1: (-24, -47, right, 24) — head h=-24, tail τ=-47, direction right, speed 24.\n\nSince right-moving, span at time T: [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] = [-47 + 24 Δt, -24 + 24 Δt]\n\nFreeway 2: (60, 25, right, 36) — [25 + 36 Δt, 60 + 36 Δt]\n\nFreeway 3: same as 2? (60, 25, right, 36) so same as freeway 2.\n\nFreeway 4: (60, 25, right, 36) same as 2 and 3.\n\nFreeway 5: multiple cars: (48, 37, right, 6), (12, 1, right, 6), (-24, -35, right, 6)\n\nSo three cars on freeway 5.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6: same as 5, (48, 37, right, 6), (12, 1, right, 6), (-24, -35, right, 6)\n\nFreeway 7: (36, 25, right, 12) — [25 + 12 Δt, 36 + 12 Δt]\n\nFreeway 8: (12, 1, right, 4) — [1 + 4 Δt, 12 + 4 Δt]\n\nNow, the player is at y=8 at turn 31.\n\nWe need to go to y=9, which is not a freeway, I think? The freeways are y=1 to 8, and y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, so no cars there, so when at y=0 or y=9, no collision possible.\n\nThe vertical axis is y=0,1,2,...,9, and freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nThe goal is to reach (0,9), so once we are at y=9, we are safe.\n\nCurrently at (0,8), and we need to reach (0,9).\n\nTo reach y=9 from y=8, we need to move up, so action U at some turn.\n\nBut when we move up, at the turn we move, we are still on y=8 during that turn, so we need to ensure that at that turn, on freeway 8, no car has 0 in its span.\n\nThen, after moving, at the next turn, we are on y=9, which has no cars, so safe.\n\nWe could also stay or move down, but since we want to minimize turns, moving up directly might be best, but we need to check if it's safe at some turn.\n\nFirst, let's find when it's safe to be on freeway 8, meaning no car on freeway 8 has 0 in its span at that turn.\n\nFreeway 8 has one car: (12, 1, right, 4)\n\nSpan at turn T: [1 + 4 Δt, 12 + 4 Δt], with Δt = T - 31\n\n0 is in span if 1 + 4 Δt ≤ 0 ≤ 12 + 4 Δt\n\nBut since Δt ≥ 0, 1 + 4 Δt ≥ 1 > 0, so 0 is never ≤ 12 + 4 Δt, but 0 is less than 1 + 4 Δt for Δt ≥ 0, since 1 + 4 Δt ≥ 1 > 0, so 0 < lower bound, so 0 is never in [1 + 4 Δt, 12 + 4 Δt] for any Δt ≥ 0.\n\nLet me solve:\n\n1 + 4 Δt ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ 12 + 4 Δt\n\nFirst inequality: 1 + 4 Δt ≤ 0 ⇒ 4 Δt ≤ -1 ⇒ Δt ≤ -1/4, but Δt = T-31 ≥ 0 since T ≥ 31, so impossible.\n\nSecond inequality 0 ≤ 12 + 4 Δt is always true for Δt ≥ 0.\n\nBut for 0 to be in the interval, both must hold: lower ≤ 0 ≤ upper.\n\nHere lower = 1 + 4 Δt ≥ 1 > 0, so 0 < lower, thus 0 < lower ≤ upper, so 0 not in [lower, upper] since lower > 0.\n\nSimilarly, for all T, the span [1 + 4 Δt, 12 + 4 Δt] is always to the right of x=1, so x=0 is never covered. Thus, on freeway 8, there is never a collision possible with this car, because the car is always at x ≥ 1.\n\nAt turn 31, Δt=0, span [1,12], which is from x=1 to x=12, so x=0 is not included. Similarly for other times, as Δt increases, the car moves right, so span starts at 1 + 4 Δt >1, so x=0 is always safe on freeway 8.\n\nTherefore, at any turn, if the player is on y=8, it is safe, because the car doesn't cover x=0.\n\nNow, similarly, for other freeways, but we need to go to y=9.\n\nThe player is at y=8 at turn 31.\n\nWe can move up immediately at turn 31 with action U.\n\nAt turn 31, when we take action, we are on y=8, and as we said, safe.\n\nThen we move to y=9 at turn 32.\n\nAt turn 32, we are on y=9, which has no cars, so safe.\n\nAnd we reached y=9 in one turn: from turn 31 to turn 32.\n\nH is the number of turns, I think.\n\nThe sequence: at turn t₁=31, we take action, then after H turns, we are at the position.\n\nLet's see the problem.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t₁ + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAnd \"y_{t₁ + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nStarting from turn t₁, at position (0, y_{t₁}) = (0,8)\n\nAfter actions at t₁, t₁+1, ..., up to t₁ + H - 1, we have y_{t₁ + H - 1} = 9.\n\nThe sequence has H actions: from t=0 to H-1, so actions at times t₁ to t₁ + H - 1.\n\nAfter H actions, we have done H steps, so at time t₁ + H, the position is after the last action.\n\nLet's clarify the timing.\n\nAt turn t, we are at position y_t.\n\nWe choose action a_t, which determines Δy_t, and then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nSo at turn t, we are at y_t, and after action, we move to y_{t+1}.\n\nThe state at turn t is y_t.\n\nWe start at turn t₁, with y_{t₁} = 8.\n\nWe want to reach y_{t} = 9 for some t > t₁.\n\nSpecifically, after H-1 actions? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence {a_{t₁ + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} means actions at times t₁, t₁+1, ..., t₁+H-1.\n\nAfter action at t₁+H-1, we have y_{t₁ + H}.\n\ny_{t} after action at t-1? I'm confusing myself.\n\nDefine:\n\nAt the beginning of turn t, player is at position y_t.\n\nThen, during turn t, player chooses action a_t, which causes a change, and then at the beginning of turn t+1, position is y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nSo the position is updated at the end of the turn.\n\nFor collision: during turn t, when player is at y_t, and action is taken, but the collision is checked based on the position at the beginning of the turn, I think.\n\nThe collision rule says: \"collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd y_T is the position at turn T, I assume.\n\nFrom the note: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T\"\n\nSo at turn T, you are on y_T, regardless of the action.\n\nThen, after action, you move to y_{T+1}.\n\nSo for collision at turn T, it depends on y_T and the car spans on that freeway at turn T.\n\nIn this case, at turn t₁=31, y=8.\n\nIf we take action U at turn 31, then at turn 31, we are on y=8, so we need to check freeway 8 at turn 31.\n\nAs we saw, for freeway 8, car span [1 + 4*0, 12 + 4*0] = [1,12], 0 not in [1,12], so safe.\n\nThen, after action, at turn 32, we are on y=9.\n\nAt turn 32, y=9, which is not a freeway, so no cars, so no collision possible.\n\nTherefore, we reach y=9 at turn 32, which is after one action at turn 31.\n\nSo H=1, sequence: action at turn 31: U.\n\nThen y_{32} = 8 + 1 = 9.\n\nAnd y_{t₁ + H - 1} = y_{31 + 1 - 1} = y_{31}, no.\n\nt₁ + H - 1 = 31 + H - 1.\n\nWe want y_{t₁ + H - 1} = 9.\n\nAfter actions from t=0 to H-1, the position is at time t₁ + H.\n\nSet t = t₁ + k, for k=0,1,2,...\n\nAt time t, position y_t.\n\nAfter action at time t, position becomes y_{t+1}.\n\nWe start at time t₁, y_{t₁} = 8.\n\nWe want for some T, y_T = 9.\n\nThe sequence of actions is from time t₁ to t₁ + H - 1, so H actions.\n\nAfter H actions, we are at time t₁ + H.\n\ny_{t₁ + H} should be 9.\n\nBut the condition is y_{t₁ + H - 1} = 9? Let's read.\n\n\"reach (0,9) at turn t₁ + H - 1\"\n\n\"y_{t₁ + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nIn the problem: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t₁ + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\", and \"y_{t₁ + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nSo after H-1 actions? Let's see the indices.\n\nThe actions are for t from 0 to H-1, so times: a_{t₁ + 0}, a_{t₁ + 1}, ..., a_{t₁ + H - 1}\n\nAfter taking these actions, the position at time t₁ + H should be the result.\n\nBut the condition is y_{t₁ + H - 1} = 9.\n\ny_{t₁ + H - 1} is the position at the beginning of turn t₁ + H - 1, before action.\n\nPerhaps it's better to think that at the start of turn t, position is y_t.\n\nAction a_t is taken during turn t, leading to y_{t+1}.\n\nThen, for the player to be at position (0,9) at the start of some turn.\n\nThe sequence {a_{t₁ + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} means actions taken at times t₁, t₁+1, ..., t₁+H-1.\n\nAfter these actions, the position at time t₁ + H is y_{t₁ + H}.\n\nBut we want y_{t₁ + H - 1} = 9, which is the position at the start of turn t₁ + H - 1.\n\nAt the start of turn t₁ + H - 1, position is y_{t₁ + H - 1}.\n\nThen we take action a_{t₁ + H - 1}, which may change y.\n\nBut we want y_{t₁ + H - 1} = 9, meaning that at the start of that turn, we are already at y=9.\n\nThen, if we are at y=9 at the start of turn, we don't need to take action, but the sequence includes actions up to H-1.\n\nI think there's inconsistency.\n\nPerhaps y_t is the position after action at turn t-1 or something.\n\nLet's read the player update: \"y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\", so y_{t+1} is after action at turn t.\n\nSo at turn t, before action, position is y_t, after action, position is y_{t+1}.\n\nThe collision at turn T depends on y_T, the position at the start of the turn.\n\nFor the goal, we want to be at position (0,9) at the start of some turn, I think, but the problem says \"reach (0,9)\", and \"y_{t₁ + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nSo y_{t₁ + H - 1} = 9 means at the start of turn t₁ + H - 1, position is (0,9).\n\nThen, the actions are from turn t₁ to turn t₁ + H - 1, but at turn t₁ + H - 1, if we are already at y=9, we might not need to take action, but the sequence includes it.\n\nIn this case, since we start at y=8, we need to move to y=9 at some point.\n\nIf we take action at turn t to move up, then y_{t+1} = y_t +1.\n\nSo to have y_T = 9 for some T.\n\nAt t₁=31, y=8.\n\nIf we take action U at turn 31, then y_{32} = 9.\n\nSo at the start of turn 32, position is (0,9).\n\nNow, we want y_{t₁ + H - 1} = 9.\n\nSo t₁ + H - 1 = 32, so 31 + H - 1 = 32, thus H = 2.\n\nThen the sequence has H=2 actions: t from 0 to 1, so actions at t₁ + 0 and t₁ +1, i.e., turn 31 and 32.\n\nBut at turn 32, if we are at y=9, we might not need to do anything, but we have to specify an action, but it could be S or whatever, but since we are at y=9, we can stay.\n\nBut to reach y=9 at turn 32, we only need action at turn 31: U.\n\nThen at turn 32, we are at y=9, and we can take action S, but it's not necessary for reaching, but the sequence might include it.\n\nThe minimal H.\n\nIf H=1, then sequence {a_{t₁ + t} for t=0 to 0, so one action at turn 31.\n\nAfter this action, y_{32} = y_{31} + Δy_{31}.\n\nIf a_{31} = U, then y_{32} = 9.\n\nBut we want y_{t₁ + H - 1} = y_{31 +1 -1} = y_{31} =8, which is not 9.\n\ny_{t₁ + H - 1} with H=1, t₁ +1 -1 = t₁ =31, y_{31} =8 ≠9.\n\nSo we need y_{t₁ + H - 1} =9.\n\nFor H=2, t₁ + H -1 = 31 +2 -1 =32, y_{32} =9.\n\nAnd actions at t=0 and t=1, i.e., turn 31 and 32.\n\nAt turn 31, action U to move to y=9.\n\nAt turn 32, since we are at y=9, we can take action S to stay, or U or D, but U would go to y=10, which is invalid, since y in [0,9], so y_{t+1} = min(max(y_t + Δy, 0),9), so if y_t=9, U would keep it at 9, I think, but the problem says y_{t+1} ∈ [0,9], so probably clamped.\n\nBut to be safe, we can take S at turn 32.\n\nBut in terms of reaching, after action at turn 31, we are at y=9 at turn 32, so at turn 32, we are already at the goal, so action at turn 32 can be S.\n\nSimilarly, for H=1, it's impossible to be at y=9 at turn 31, since we start at y=8.\n\nSo minimal H is 2, with actions: at turn 31: U, and at turn 32: S (or anything, but S is fine).\n\nBut we need to make sure no collision.\n\nIn this case, at turn 31, we take action U.\n\nAt turn 31, position is y=8, so we are on freeway 8.\n\nAs we checked, for freeway 8, car span [1 +4*0, 12+4*0] = [1,12], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nThen action U, so y_{32} = 8 +1 =9.\n\nAt turn 32, position y=9, not a freeway, so no collision.\n\nSo we reach (0,9) at turn 32.\n\nWith H=2, sequence: Turn 31: U, Turn 32: S.\n\nBut is H minimal? H=2 means two actions, but the first action moves us to the goal position at the next turn.\n\nPerhaps we can have H=1 if we were already there, but we are not.\n\nAnother way: if we do nothing, but we start at y=8, not 9.\n\nSo H=2 is minimal.\n\nBut in the sequence, for H=2, we have two actions, but the second one is not necessary, but we have to specify H actions.\n\nPerhaps we can reach in one step with H=1, but y_{t₁ + H -1} = y_{31} for H=1, which is 8, not 9.\n\nSo impossible with H=1.\n\nThus minimal H is 2.\n\nBut let's confirm the answer format.\n\nThe sequence should be actions from turn t₁ to t₁ + H -1.\n\nFor H=2, actions at turn 31 and 32.\n\nBut at turn 32, we are already at y=9, so action can be S.\n\nNow, but in this case, we didn't need to consider other freeways because we only stayed on y=8 for one turn and moved up.\n\nBut is there any reason we cannot move up immediately?\n\nFor example, if at turn 31, on y=8 it was unsafe, but we saw it is safe.\n\nPerhaps for other turns, but we can do it now.\n\nBut let's see the car on freeway 8: it's moving right with speed 4, at turn 31, from x=1 to 12, so x=0 is clear.\n\nSimilarly, y=9 has no cars.\n\nSo it should be fine.\n\nBut the problem has other freeways, but since we don't go to them, we don't care.\n\nWe only care about the freeways we are on during the path.\n\nIn this direct move, we are only on y=8 at turn 31, and then to y=9.\n\nNo other freeways involved.\n\nSo minimal H=2.\n\nBut let me double-check the car on freeway 8.\n\nFreeway 8: (12, 1, right, 4)\n\nAt turn T, span [1 + 4*(T-31), 12 + 4*(T-31)]\n\nFor T=31, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nFor any T, 1 + 4Δt >=1 >0, so 0 not in [1+4Δt, 12+4Δt].\n\nSo always safe on y=8.\n\nTherefore, moving up immediately is safe and minimal.\n\nSo actions: at turn 31: U, then at turn 32: S.\n\nBut in the sequence, for H=2, we need to specify two actions.\n\nSince after U at turn 31, we are at y=9 at turn 32, and we can stay.\n\nPerhaps we can do only one action, but with H=1, we can't reach y=9 at turn 31.\n\nAnother thought: can we reach y=9 at turn 31? Only if we were there, but we start at y=8.\n\nSo no.\n\nThus, minimal H is 2.\n\nBut let me see if there is a problem with other cars or something.\n\nPerhaps when we move, but the collision is per turn based on position.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nBut let me check freeway 9, but y=9 has no freeway, so no cars.\n\nSimilarly, y=0.\n\nIn this case, from y=8 to y=9 directly.\n\nBut the player is at (0,8), and we move to (0,9).\n\nPerhaps I should confirm if y=9 is reachable and safe.\n\nYes.\n\nBut in the car list, freeway 8 has a car, but as we saw, it doesn't cover x=0.\n\nSimilarly, for other freeways, but we don't visit them.\n\nSo I think H=2 with actions U at t1 and S at t1+1.\n\nBut in the sequence, it should be:\n\nTurn 31: U\n\nTurn 32: S\n\nThen at turn 32, position is y=9, and we stay.\n\nBut the position at start of turn 32 is y=9, which is the goal.\n\nIn terms of turns, from turn 31 to turn 32, we reached in one action step, but two turns are involved.\n\nThe number of turns H is 2, meaning we use two turns to reach, but the first turn we are at start position, last turn we reach.\n\nI think it's correct.\n\nTo be thorough, let's see if we can reach faster, but no.\n\nPerhaps if we move down or something, but that would take more turns, not minimal.\n\nFor example, if we move down to y=7, then we need to go to y=8 or 9 later, which takes more turns.\n\nSo not better.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=2.\n\nBut in the sequence, for turn 32, action S is fine, or we could do nothing, but we have to specify an action.\n\nS is stay.\n\nNow, but let me look back at the problem: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t₁ + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\"\n\nAnd in the answer, it should be listed as Turn t1: a, Turn t1+1: a, etc.\n\nSo for H=2:\n\nTurn 31: U\n\nTurn 32: S\n\nBut is S necessary? After U at turn 31, at turn 32 we are at y=9, which is the goal, so we don't need to take further action, but since H=2 includes two actions, we specify S for the second.\n\nPerhaps we can have H=1, but as we saw, impossible.\n\nAnother interpretation: perhaps \"reach (0,9) at turn t₁ + H -1\" means that after actions up to t₁ + H -2, we are at (0,9) at turn t₁ + H -1.\n\nI think I have it.\n\nI think for consistency, in many such problems, H is the number of actions to reach the goal state.\n\nBut here it specifies y_{t₁ + H -1} =9.\n\nIn this case, with one action U at turn 31, we reach y=9 at turn 32, so t=32 = t₁ +1.\n\nSet t = t₁ + k.\n\nAt k=0, turn t₁, y=8\n\nAfter action a_{t₁}, y_{t₁+1} = ?\n\nIf a_{t₁} = U, y_{t₁+1} =9\n\nThen at turn t₁+1, y=9.\n\nWe want y_{t₁ + H -1} =9.\n\nSo t₁ + H -1 = t₁ +1, so H-1 =1, H=2.\n\nThen y_{t₁ + H -1} = y_{t₁ +1} =9.\n\nAnd actions: for t=0 to H-1=1, so a_{t₁ +0} and a_{t₁ +1}, i.e., a_{t₁} and a_{t₁+1}\n\na_{t₁} = U to move to y=9\n\na_{t₁+1} = S, for example, at turn t₁+1, since we are at y=9.\n\nSo it's fine.\n\nPerhaps we can set a_{t₁+1} to U or D, but since y=9, U would stay at 9, D to 8, but we want to be at y=9, so if we do D, we move away, so we should do S to stay.\n\nBut in the sequence, after a_{t₁} U, we are at y=9, and a_{t₁+1} S keeps us there.\n\nSo for the purpose, it's ok.\n\nThus, minimal H is 2.\n\nBut I feel like it might be too straightforward, and perhaps I missed something because there are many cars listed, but we didn't use them.\n\nMaybe for freeway 8, is there a car that covers x=0 at some time?\n\nIn this case, no, as calculated.\n\nPerhaps the car on freeway 8: (12,1,right,4), at turn 31, [1,12], all x>=1.\n\nAs time increases, it moves right, x increases, so x=0 never covered.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways have cars, but since we don't go there, no issue.\n\nFor example, freeway 7 has car (36,25,right,12), span [25 +12Δt, 36+12Δt], all x>=25>0, so never covers x=0.\n\nFreeway 6 has multiple cars, but all with min x: let's see.\n\nFreeway 5 and 6 have cars: for example, (-24,-35,right,6), span [-35 +6Δt, -24 +6Δt]\n\nAt Δt=0, [-35,-24], which is left of 0, and 0 not in [-35,-24].\n\nWhen does it cover x=0?\n\nSet -35 +6Δt <= 0 <= -24 +6Δt\n\nFirst, -35 +6Δt <=0 => 6Δt <=35 => Δt <= 35/6 ≈5.833\n\nSecond, 0 <= -24 +6Δt => 6Δt >=24 => Δt >=4\n\nSo for Δt from 4 to 5.833, i.e., T from 31+4=35 to 31+5=36? Δt=4, T=35, span [-35+24, -24+24] = [-11,0]\n\n-35+6*4 = -35+24= -11, -24+24=0, so [ -11, 0], and 0 is included? 0 <= 0 is true, and -11 <=0, so yes, 0 in [-11,0].\n\nSimilarly, at Δt=5, T=36, span [-35+30, -24+30] = [-5,6], 0 in it.\n\nΔt=6, T=37, [-35+36, -24+36]=[1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo on freeway 5 and 6, for T=35,36, if player is there, collision possible.\n\nBut we are not going there.\n\nSimilarly, other cars.\n\nBut for us, on freeway 8, no issue.\n\nSo I think moving up immediately is fine.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=2, sequence:\n\nTurn 31: U\n\nTurn 32: S\n\nIn the answer, it should be boxed.\n\nBut let me write it.\n\nThe problem says \"avoiding collisions\", and we did.\n\nPerhaps I need to output the sequence.\n\nBut in the car state, freeway 5 and 6 have multiple cars, but again, not relevant.\n\nFreeway 8 has only one car, safe.\n\nAnother thing: in freeway 5, it lists three cars, similarly for 6.\n\nBut for freeway 8, only one.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n\nSo the minimal H is 2.\n\nBut let me see if we can do with H=1, impossible.\n\nOr if we move at a different time, but since we can move now, no need to wait.\n\nThus, the sequence should be:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 31: \\ U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 32: \\ S \\end{array} }\n\nIn the format, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc., so:\n\nTurn 31: U\n\nTurn 32: S\n\nAnd H=2.\n\nPerhaps we don't need the S, but since H=2 requires two actions, we include it.\n\nIf we set a_{32} to U, but y=9, U would do nothing or stay, similarly.\n\nBut S is explicit stay.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nSo I believe this is the answer.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 8) at turn 31. The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to 8.\n\nAt turn 31, the player is on freeway y=8. The car on freeway 8 has the state (head=12, tail=1, direction=right, speed=4). The span of this car at any turn T is given by [1 + 4Δt, 12 + 4Δt], where Δt = T - 31. Since 1 + 4Δt ≥ 1 > 0 for all Δt ≥ 0, x=0 is never within the span, meaning the player is safe on freeway 8 at any turn, including turn 31.\n\nTo reach y=9, the player must move up (action U) from y=8. Taking action U at turn 31 moves the player to y=9 at turn 32. At turn 32, the player is at y=9, which is not a freeway (freeways are only y=1 to 8), so there are no cars and no collision risk.\n\nThe minimal number of turns H to reach y=9 at turn t₁ + H - 1 is H=2, since:\n- At turn 31 (t₁), y=8.\n- After action U at turn 31, y_{32} = 9.\n- Thus, at turn t₁ + H - 1 = 31 + 2 - 1 = 32, y_{32} = 9.\n\nThe sequence requires H=2 actions: at turn 31 and turn 32. The action at turn 31 is U to move to y=9. At turn 32, the player is at y=9, so the action S (stay) is taken to remain at y=9, as moving up or down is unnecessary and could risk moving away from the goal.\n\nNo other freeways are visited, so other cars do not affect the path. Moving immediately is safe and minimal, as waiting or moving down would increase H unnecessarily.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 31: \\ U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 32: \\ S \\end{array} }",
